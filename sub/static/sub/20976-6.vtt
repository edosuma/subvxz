Growing up, it was my parents,
my older sister Evelyn,

01:07.500 --> 01:11.266
and my twin brother Spiro.
When I was eleven years old,

01:14.734 --> 01:17.367
Three years ago,
I got on my scooter,

and I must have fallen asleep,
and I drove into a steel fence.

01:22.033 --> 01:25.433
Blood was gushing from my head.
I should have worn a helmet.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.667
When I got to the hospital,
just a normal doctor

01:28.667 --> 01:31.233
stitched my face up.
Around two or three months

01:31.233 --> 01:34.633
after the accident, I realized
when the scab fell off

01:34.633 --> 01:36.700
that I had three eyebrows
instead of two.

01:36.700 --> 01:40.700
I was very disappointed, upset,
and shocked.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.033
People would stare at me funny.
People would always ask me

01:44.033 --> 01:45.500
what happened,
and I'd always have

01:45.500 --> 01:49.100
to discuss the accident.
I started filling in my eyebrow

01:49.100 --> 01:52.667
with eyeliner.
I started doing that so it

01:52.667 --> 01:55.433
would look like I have two
eyebrows, because if I don't

01:55.433 --> 01:58.133
have the scar anymore,
I won't have to explain

01:58.133 --> 02:00.367
the accident,
and I won't have to relive it,

02:00.367 --> 02:04.333
and I can get on with my life.
I met my girlfriend the week

02:04.333 --> 02:08.600
I came out of the hospital.
I looked pretty scary,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.533
like Frankenstein,
but we had a good connection,

02:11.533 --> 02:16.033
and we hit it off nicely.
Around a year and a half

02:16.033 --> 02:20.133
after Michelle and I met,
we had a daughter, Angelina.

02:20.133 --> 02:25.533
Angelina is 13 months now
and has been pointing at my scar

02:25.533 --> 02:29.400
and my eyebrow, asking me,
"What's"

02:29.400 --> 02:31.700
I don't want my daughter
to remember the scar,

02:31.700 --> 02:37.400

03:42.734 --> 03:45.467
I figured out,
"Crap, I've had an accident."

03:45.467 --> 03:48.633
There wasn't a plastic surgeon
in the hospital so just

03:48.633 --> 03:51.633
a normal doctor stitched it up.
>> So it was an emergency room

03:51.633 --> 03:53.100
doctor, really, right?
>> Yes.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.767
>> The emergency room physician
was more interested in

03:55.767 --> 03:59.500
saving George's life
than making his forehead look

as cosmetically acceptable
as possible, and that's

04:02.100 --> 04:05.066

haven't had this fixed yet?

04:19.266 --> 04:21.000

for the first year,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.233
I can't touch it
until it heals 100%,

04:23.233 --> 04:26.133

She still sort of points to it
and touches it.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.700
an abnormality that you can hide
with your clothes,

04:38.700 --> 04:42.000
but when you have it
in the middle of your face,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.767
you can't hide it.
I just hope

04:43.767 --> 04:46.767
that we can help him.
Let's take a peek.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.667
Lower your chin for us.
So this scar,

04:49.667 --> 04:52.266
so you have a big scar.
This actually is not bad here,

04:52.266 --> 04:54.066
but you have that big scar
right in the center.

04:54.066 --> 04:58.300
>> Yeah.
>> So your tissue

04:58.300 --> 05:00.266
is a little tight.
>> Yes.

05:00.266 --> 05:03.166
>> To me what I think is
gonna be the safest way to go,

05:03.166 --> 05:07.266
just so that we have absolutely
no tension anywhere,

05:07.266 --> 05:09.533
is to put something
called a tissue expander

05:09.533 --> 05:12.000
in your forehead.
So what we would do,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.300
in the first stage
is most likely make an incision

05:16.300 --> 05:18.133
up here, lift up the tissue...
>> Yes.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.533
>> To create a pocket for this
tissue expander.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.567
Put it down right in this area,
and there'll be what we call

05:24.567 --> 05:27.033
a little port, a port that we
can fill it with a syringe.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.533
>> Okay.
>> It'll be underneath the skin.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.033
>> Yes.
>> And then we're gonna

05:30.033 --> 05:33.333
come back, you know,
every week or two weeks,

05:33.333 --> 05:36.066
and fill it up for you.
>> How big do you think

05:36.066 --> 05:38.500
it will get eventually,
like the size of a tennis ball?

05:38.500 --> 05:41.433
>> Well, probably--probably,
maybe, a little bit bigger

05:41.433 --> 05:42.700
than a tennis ball, but...
>> Wow.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.300
>> Something kind of like that.
>> My immediate thoughts

05:45.300 --> 05:49.100
of having a tennis-ball-size
tissue expander in the middle

05:49.100 --> 05:53.200
of my forehead is a bit
embarrassing, but at this point,

05:53.200 --> 05:56.700
I'm willing to do whatever I
need to do to get the best

05:56.700 --> 05:58.433
results possible.
>> And then we'll make

05:58.433 --> 06:01.300
the definitive procedure there.
We'll actually cut out

06:01.300 --> 06:04.600
the tissue, realign things.
>> You can connect this eyebrow

06:04.600 --> 06:06.233
with this one?
>> That's our goal, obviously.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.500
It's the main goal
with this game.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.300
>> Awesome. Beautiful.
If all goes well with the

06:09.300 --> 06:12.633
surgery, I'm hoping my daughter
won't remember my scar,

06:12.633 --> 06:16.734
I'm hoping to look like my twin
brother again, and I'm hoping

06:16.734 --> 06:19.367
to enjoy the rest of my life.
>> Pleasure.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.500
>> Thank you so much.
It's a pleasure.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.767
>> Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.600
>> I look forward to seeing
you guys again.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.266
Than you guys for coming in.
>> Thank you, thank you.

06:26.266 --> 06:30.200
>> Thank you.
>> I'm Elizabeth Starr.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.533
I'm from Los Angeles,
California, and I'm a walking

06:34.533 --> 06:37.367
science experiment.
My upbringing was

06:37.367 --> 06:40.333
relatively normal.
My parents were originally

06:40.333 --> 06:44.633
in the entertainment business,
and when I was an early teenager

06:44.633 --> 06:47.233
I decided to start
acting and modeling.

06:47.233 --> 06:51.734
I was doing convention modeling,
swimsuit modeling,

06:51.734 --> 06:54.166
and actually getting married.
Shortly after that,

06:54.166 --> 06:59.266
I had my first son.
Because I opted to nurse

06:59.266 --> 07:04.100
my kids, I ended up with
saggy boobs that I could maybe

07:04.100 --> 07:07.166
flip over my shoulder.
I opted for my first

07:07.166 --> 07:11.033
augmentation about the age
of 25.

07:11.033 --> 07:16.233
The implants were small,
and I wasn't happy, because

07:16.233 --> 07:19.500
at that point I had made a jump
from regular modeling and acting

07:19.500 --> 07:24.533
to the adult industry.
During that period of time,

07:24.533 --> 07:27.633
I was supporting two young
children on my own, so...

07:27.633 --> 07:29.767
I better figure

07:29.767 --> 07:34.033
something out here.
I decided to go bustier.

07:34.033 --> 07:39.166
I was speaking with one
of my friends, and she said,

07:39.166 --> 07:42.000
"You should have this
polypropylene procedure.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.400
The doctor will remove your
implants and insert a little bit

07:45.400 --> 07:49.433
of polypropylene string.
Then the breast continues

07:49.433 --> 07:53.300
to start reproducing this fluid
and filling your--your breasts

07:53.300 --> 07:55.567
up with it," and I'm thinking,
"Well, is it safe?"

07:55.567 --> 07:57.667
"Oh, yes, everything's fine.
The doctor's working

07:57.667 --> 08:00.200
with the FDA."
I thought, "This is great."

08:00.200 --> 08:06.000
So I made plans for the surgery,
and, surprise, not only was it

08:06.000 --> 08:08.433
not approved by the FDA,
but he was practicing

08:08.433 --> 08:11.567
without a medical license.

08:11.567 --> 08:15.300
I ended up being very ill.
I went to another doctor,

08:15.300 --> 08:19.033
and they put me on antibiotics
for a staph infection, and it

08:19.033 --> 08:20.767
had been eating all my
breast tissue away.

08:20.767 --> 08:24.700
I need to speak with Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow, because

08:24.700 --> 08:27.600
at this point I need to
slightly increase the size

08:27.600 --> 08:29.467
of the right one
to match the left.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.567
Because I am in the adult film
industry, I need to know if

08:32.567 --> 08:37.633
there's anything I can do
and still keep my looks.

08:37.633 --> 08:40.633
>> Because I was 17, the doctor
told me that he had to call it

08:40.633 --> 08:43.200

I was just so ready

08:43.200 --> 08:44.700
to get them done,
I didn't even care.

08:44.700 --> 08:49.433
>> He actually did unnecessary

08:49.433 --> 08:53.600

>> My name is Stephanie,

09:04.100 --> 09:08.266
and these are my saggy baggies.
I was born in

09:08.266 --> 09:11.100
Salt Lake City, Utah.
In middle school, when all the

09:11.100 --> 09:13.600
other girls were going through
puberty and starting to get

09:13.600 --> 09:16.133
breasts, I felt like I was one
of the only ones who

09:16.133 --> 09:18.734
wasn't developing.
By the age of 17,

09:18.734 --> 09:22.500
nothing had changed, so I wanted
to get breast implants,

09:22.500 --> 09:24.667
and that's when I started
talking to my mom about it.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.767
She knew that this was something
that I really wanted,

09:26.767 --> 09:29.734
so I set up a consult,
and we went right in.

09:29.734 --> 09:33.066
Because I was 17, the doctor
told me that he had to call it

09:33.066 --> 09:35.767
a reconstruction surgery.
I was just so ready

09:35.767 --> 09:37.734
to get them done.
I didn't even care.

09:37.734 --> 09:40.500
After the consult, I would say
it was only about a week and

09:40.500 --> 09:43.567
a half, and I had my surgery.
I healed very fast,

09:43.567 --> 09:46.133
and I really loved my breasts
in the beginning,

09:46.133 --> 09:48.633
because they were so swollen,
and I liked the size of them.

09:48.633 --> 09:51.367
About a year and a half
after my surgery, I knew

09:51.367 --> 09:54.133
that something was going wrong.
I was in a lot of pain,

09:54.133 --> 09:58.433
actually, and I could see how
the breast implant was actually

09:58.433 --> 10:01.633
rising, but my natural breast
was just starting to hang off

10:01.633 --> 10:05.500
the breast implant.
I never had the opportunity to

10:05.500 --> 10:08.667
look into getting my breasts
fixed because three weeks later,

10:08.667 --> 10:12.300
I found out I was pregnant.
Now, my husband and I have

10:12.300 --> 10:15.500
three little ones, and the pain
is something that I have to

10:15.500 --> 10:18.667
deal with every day.
I can't lift up my kids,

10:18.667 --> 10:21.500
you know, go play T-ball
with them or things as simple

10:21.500 --> 10:25.433
as just taking them anywhere.
When I look back now, I know

10:25.433 --> 10:29.266
that I was way too young at 17
to get a breast augmentation,

10:29.266 --> 10:34.667

can make me feel better.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.533
pretty significant complications
associated with it.

10:44.533 --> 10:46.000
>> Absolutely.
>> Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
>> Okay?
>> Okay.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.266
Can you please
send in Stephanie?

10:52.266 --> 10:53.533
>> Hi.
>> Hi, Stephanie.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.033
I'm Dr. Nassif.
>> Nice to meet you.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.300
>> Hi, Stephanie.
I'm Terry Dubrow.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.066
>> Hi, nice to meet you.
>> Pleasure to meet you.

10:58.066 --> 10:59.734
>> Robert Lopez.
>> Robert. How are you, Robert?

10:59.734 --> 11:01.400
>> Good, how are you?
>> Hi, Terry Dubrow. Pleasure.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
>> I'm meeting with the doctors.
I'm excited that hopefully

11:03.400 --> 11:06.166
they can help me
and get rid of the pain

11:06.166 --> 11:09.300
and also make me look better,
but I'm nervous that they

11:09.300 --> 11:11.033
won't be able to.
>> You had breast

11:11.033 --> 11:12.500
augmentation very young.
>> Yeah.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.600
>> Did you have
a breast deformity?

11:14.600 --> 11:18.433
>> Yeah, they were real small,
but they were very pointy.

11:18.433 --> 11:19.700
>> So it wasn't tumors,
it sounds like.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.567
>> No.
>> It's a small, small breast.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.300
>> Yeah.
>> From the sound of it,

11:23.300 --> 11:25.300
Stephanie didn't have
a breast deformity.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.600
She just had small breasts.
>> He told me that

11:27.600 --> 11:30.734
because I was 17,
the only way he could do it is

11:30.734 --> 11:33.033
if he did a revision.
>> Do you mean

11:33.033 --> 11:35.433
the word "reconstruction"?
>> Yes, it was

11:35.433 --> 11:36.734
construction, uh-huh.
>> Right, okay, now, was he

11:36.734 --> 11:38.567
doing silicone or saline?
>> Silicone.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.033
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.300
>> That's why. That was why--
>> That's why.

11:42.300 --> 11:48.100
So in order to do silicone
in someone under the age of 23,

11:48.100 --> 11:52.066
patients have to have
a deformity of the breast.

11:52.066 --> 11:56.500
So not only did he write down
that you were a reconstruction

11:56.500 --> 12:00.633
patient when you weren't,
but he actually did unnecessary

12:00.633 --> 12:03.500
and inappropriate surgery.
>> Wow.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.734
It scares me that I was that
naive, and I went into

12:06.734 --> 12:09.367
something, and I didn't even
know what I was really doing.

12:09.367 --> 12:13.367
>> We've seen the pictures.
We see that your breast implants

12:13.367 --> 12:15.533
have migrated upwards.
>> Yeah.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.500
>> And that's usually due
to the number one complication,

12:18.500 --> 12:21.500
which is called capsular
contracture, and that can be

12:21.500 --> 12:23.333
associated with some symptoms.
What kind of symptoms

12:23.333 --> 12:24.600
are you having?
>> Burning.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.033
>> Burning?
>> Yeah, taking care of my kids,

12:27.033 --> 12:30.133
it's hard to pick them up
sometimes, and when he's at

12:30.133 --> 12:33.367
work, and, like, taking them
to T-ball practice, it's hard

12:33.367 --> 12:36.633
for me to get all three kids
out in the stroller.

12:36.633 --> 12:39.400
It hurts me.
>> Why don't we go in and do

12:39.400 --> 12:42.266
a really careful examination
and see if we can figure

12:42.266 --> 12:44.100
this thing out, okay?
>> Okay, awesome. Thank you.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.567
>> Yeah.
>> Let's go.

12:45.567 --> 12:48.166
>> Stephanie's not able
to be there for her family

12:48.166 --> 12:51.667
the way she wants to be.
I'm hoping we can find a way

12:51.667 --> 12:55.400
to relieve her of her problem
and her pain.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.400
Okay, your implants are up here,
and your breast tissue

12:59.400 --> 13:01.500
is essentially hanging off
your implants.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.400
Okay, and your pain is where?
>> Like through here.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.333
>> Through there.

13:09.667 --> 13:13.133
It's interesting.
You don't have classic

13:13.133 --> 13:17.300
capsular contracture, because
your breasts are very soft,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.667
and when you have capsular
contracture, you always get

13:20.667 --> 13:24.734
hardening of the breasts.
So the implants look like

13:24.734 --> 13:27.400
they're encapsulated, but in
fact, I think your operation

13:27.400 --> 13:29.734
was just done poorly.
She actually doesn't really

13:29.734 --> 13:33.200
necessarily have a breast
implant complication,

13:33.200 --> 13:36.667
but more likely she probably had
the surgery done

13:36.667 --> 13:40.300
slightly improperly.
Here's the problem, okay?

13:40.300 --> 13:44.700
We can go in there and set
the implant into the pocket,

13:44.700 --> 13:49.667
but the question is, will that
relieve you of your pain?

13:49.667 --> 13:52.033
I can't guarantee you that.
>> Right.

13:52.033 --> 13:55.033
>> I'm hoping I can get her
in a place where she's looking

13:55.033 --> 13:59.166
and feeling great again,
but until the operation comes,

13:59.166 --> 14:01.567
I have no idea.
>> I think that I want to

14:01.567 --> 14:05.200
at least try getting the look
that I wanted that I never got.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.300
>> Right.
>> Knowing that, you know,

14:07.300 --> 14:09.567
there's no guarantee
that the pain will go away

14:09.567 --> 14:12.633
makes me feel very nervous,
but I'm really just hoping

14:12.633 --> 14:15.700
that I can get back
to who I was, and do the things

14:15.700 --> 14:18.300
that I want to do with my kids,
and not have to worry

14:18.300 --> 14:22.700
about my pain.
>> Okay, I think we're good.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.166
I think we can go ahead
and do this.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.300
>> Thank you so much.
>> I think we've got a plan.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.433
>> Pleasure meeting you.
>> Pleasure meeting you.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.333
>> I decided to put two
expanders in George's forehead.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.367
The depth is so important.
If the implant is too

14:35.367 --> 14:38.200
superficial, it's gonna break
right through the skin.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.767
If you put it too deep,
it may not be effective.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.200
>> I had a very serious
staph infection.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.734
I had fluid coming out
of this hole that was the size

14:46.734 --> 14:48.667
of a silver dollar.

14:53.467 --> 14:56.600
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

14:56.600 --> 15:00.467
♪ ♪
>> Hi, good morning.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.767
>> Hi.
>> I'm here to check in.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.266
I'm having surgery
with Dr. Nassif today.

15:03.266 --> 15:05.266
>> Perfect.
Go ahead and sign in.

15:05.266 --> 15:08.333
>> Thank you. I feel great.
I feel very excited.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.233
I feel a bit nervous,
but touch wood,

15:11.233 --> 15:15.233
everything will go okay.
Good morning.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.367
>> George.
>> How are you?

15:17.367 --> 15:20.633
Nice to see you.
>> So...

15:20.633 --> 15:22.500
you ready to get moving on this?
>> Yes.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.433
>> I'm going to mark his...

15:26.700 --> 15:28.500
Let's talk about your procedure.
>> Okay.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.233
>> I do have a change
in our plan.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.767
Instead of one expander
going in...

15:33.767 --> 15:35.500
>> Oh, no, I have two.
>> I'm going to put two.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.533
>> Why two expanders now
instead of one?

15:37.533 --> 15:40.633
>> I need a lot of skin
to mobilize for you.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.433
I'm nervous that one
may not work.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.000
Two will definitely
do the trick,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.367
and I'd rather be safe
than sorry.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.033
>> Look after me. Be gentle.
>> All right, I'll see you when

15:50.033 --> 15:51.300
you wake up, buddy.
>> Thank you, thank you.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.400
>> Our pleasure.
Today is the first part

15:53.400 --> 15:56.600
of two procedures for George.
Our goal with these expanders

15:56.600 --> 15:59.433
is stretching the skin.
That's gonna give us better

15:59.433 --> 16:04.300
expansion of the scalp
and forehead tissue,

16:04.300 --> 16:07.200
and even though he's gonna look
kind of weird--but we're gonna

16:07.200 --> 16:10.000
put 'em in and get the best
result possible for George.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.166
For George's first stage,
I'll begin by making an incision

16:13.166 --> 16:16.166
down the middle of his forehead,
lifting up the skin, and

16:16.166 --> 16:19.700
inserting two tissue expanders.
I'll gradually inflate the

16:19.700 --> 16:23.033
expanders over the next several
weeks to stretch the skin

16:23.033 --> 16:25.467
before going back in and
removing them and fixing

16:25.467 --> 16:30.433
his scar and eyebrow.
Here we go. Let's have a 15.

16:30.433 --> 16:33.133
As we make our incision,
our goal is to elevate a plane

16:33.133 --> 16:35.033
where the tissue expanders
are gonna go,

16:35.033 --> 16:39.166
and we want to make sure that
we don't do it too superficial.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.300
We don't want to do it too deep.
It's just got to be

16:41.300 --> 16:44.066
in the right plane.
The depth is so important

16:44.066 --> 16:46.734
because as these expanders fill
up, there's tension placed

16:46.734 --> 16:48.500
on the skin.
If the implant is too

16:48.500 --> 16:51.333
superficial, it's gonna break
right through the skin.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.734
If you put it too deep,
it may not be effective.

16:53.734 --> 16:58.333
Where are the expanders?
That's cute.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.066
>> It's so cute.
>> We're putting in two

17:01.066 --> 17:03.700
different size expanders
in George's forehead.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.567
There'll be a larger one on
the left side around the scar,

17:06.567 --> 17:09.600
because that's where we need
to rotate the tissue

17:09.600 --> 17:12.433
down a good amount.
Now, on the right side

17:12.433 --> 17:14.567
we'll put a smaller one
because all we have to do

17:14.567 --> 17:17.600
is advance tissue
just towards the left,

17:17.600 --> 17:21.066
and with the small one,
we should be fine.

17:21.066 --> 17:25.400
Okay, let's see how this goes.
We're gonna put some saline

17:25.400 --> 17:28.500
into 'em and expand them a
little bit, because we don't

17:28.500 --> 17:32.233
want to expand George's skin
initially too much.

17:32.233 --> 17:35.500
That may cause a breakdown of
the wound that we just closed,

17:35.500 --> 17:38.200
so we have to be conservative.
Well, let's see

17:38.200 --> 17:40.667
what this looks like.
Come on through.

17:40.667 --> 17:46.233
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Okay, so we're done.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.667
I don't think he'll be in that
much pain, because it doesn't

17:48.667 --> 17:51.066
look like it's expanding
that much.

17:51.066 --> 17:52.600
The expanders are placed,
and they seem to be

17:52.600 --> 17:55.266
fitting nicely.
Now what we need to do is

17:55.266 --> 17:58.467
to expand George's forehead,
and then come back in six

17:58.467 --> 18:02.300
to seven weeks, take them out,
and then finally,

18:02.300 --> 18:06.300
put George's eyebrow back
together again.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.033
Okay. Great job, everybody.
>> Okay, thank you.

18:09.033 --> 18:10.767
>> Great job.

18:12.367 --> 18:16.533
>> I know we've seen crazy cases
before, but this is something

18:16.533 --> 18:21.233
out of your wildest imagination.
This is a patient named

18:21.233 --> 18:25.000
Elizabeth who makes her living
based on her large,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.266
large breasts...
>> All right.

18:26.266 --> 18:30.533
>> Who had what's called
polypropylene implants placed.

18:30.533 --> 18:35.133
What the polypropylene does is,
it induces an inflammatory

18:35.133 --> 18:39.233
response, so you essentially
make edema fluid.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.633
So slowly your breast
gets larger and larger,

18:41.633 --> 18:44.333
kind of a neat idea, right?
>> If it stops.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.734
>> It doesn't stop.
>> Ah.

18:45.734 --> 18:48.567
>> Let me show you exactly what
she's looking like right now.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.433
>> Okay.
>> Look at this.

18:51.433 --> 18:54.133
Is that crazy?
>> How did that happen?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.667
>> Those are breasts
out of control.

18:57.667 --> 19:02.266
A polypropylene string implant
is not a traditional round

19:02.266 --> 19:07.133
breast implant, but is really
a series of plastic strings

19:07.133 --> 19:11.734
that are implanted inside of
the chest, designed to incite

19:11.734 --> 19:15.066
an inflammatory reaction,
which leads to fluid

19:15.066 --> 19:18.300
accumulation, increasing the
volume of the breast.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.567
Unfortunately, that volume
increase is uncontrollable.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.166
Let's bring her in and see if
there is something

19:24.166 --> 19:28.567
we can do for her.
>> Please send in Elizabeth.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.066
How are you, Elizabeth?
>> Hi.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.700
>> I'm Dr. Nassif.
>> Nice to meet you.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.467
>> Hi, Elizabeth, Terry Dubrow.
Pleasure to meet you.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.734
>> Nice to meet you.
>> Please have a seat.

19:35.734 --> 19:39.734
>> I know I have an extremely
unique situation, and I'm just

19:39.734 --> 19:41.633
hoping that the doctors
can help me out.

19:41.633 --> 19:45.033
>> I must know
how you got to this point.

19:45.033 --> 19:49.433
>> The first augmentation I had
was when I was approximately 25.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.433
I was swimsuit
and convention modeling.

19:51.433 --> 19:53.066
>> So you had a breast
augmentation the first time.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.500
A simple breast augmentation.
>> Correct.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.700
>> What were the first
size implants you put in?

19:56.700 --> 20:02.033
>> Very small, only filled to
about 500 and something ccs.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.300
>> Very small?
>> Yes.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.300
>> Okay.
When you consider that

20:05.300 --> 20:09.734
the most common size implant
is around 275 to 350ccs,

20:09.734 --> 20:14.333
and the highest that are made
are 800ccs, 500cc implants,

20:14.333 --> 20:18.233
you're getting up towards,
even on a flat-chested woman,

20:18.233 --> 20:24.000
a full double D.
>> I was a little unhappy

20:24.000 --> 20:27.600
with the way that they were
settling afterwards,

20:27.600 --> 20:31.400
and I wanted to go
a little bit bustier

20:31.400 --> 20:38.266
because, at that time, I had
embarked on my adult career.

20:38.266 --> 20:42.500
And I was sitting across the
table from one of my friends.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.734
I was staring at her breasts
the whole Thanksgiving dinner.

20:45.734 --> 20:49.500
45 minutes into dinner, I said,
"Is it my imagination,

20:49.500 --> 20:52.767
or are your breasts larger?"
>> They're getting bigger right

20:52.767 --> 20:54.567
in front of your very eyes.
>> They were

20:54.567 --> 20:57.533
considerably larger.
She said, "Yes, my boobs

20:57.533 --> 21:01.500
are bigger, Elizabeth.
Yes, they are, they are."

21:01.500 --> 21:05.500
She had gone and had the
polypropylene procedure done.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.033
>> You thought that was
a good idea.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.767
It sounded like a good idea.
>> Right.

21:08.767 --> 21:12.000
>> So let me ask you a question.
Both implants were removed,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.400
and both were replaced
by the polypropylene

21:14.400 --> 21:16.667
string implant, correct?
>> Yes.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.667
>> Tell us what happened next.
>> By the fourth week,

21:19.667 --> 21:22.367
my breast was bright red.
>> So you got

21:22.367 --> 21:24.767
a breast infection.
>> I had a very serious

21:24.767 --> 21:26.433
staph infection.
All of a sudden,

21:26.433 --> 21:30.533
I sprung a leak.
So I had fluid coming out

21:30.533 --> 21:34.533
of this hole in my body that was
the size of a silver dollar.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.567
>> Under the areola,
or under the breast?

21:36.567 --> 21:38.300
>> Under the areola.
>> Okay, what happened?

21:38.300 --> 21:40.400
Did it ultimately close?
Did you have surgery?

21:40.400 --> 21:44.266
>> All he would do, every two
weeks, is cut a little bit more

21:44.266 --> 21:47.266
tissue away from my areola
and send me on my way.

21:47.266 --> 21:50.300
No tests, no nothing.
>> Okay, but you still had a

21:50.300 --> 21:52.000
breast filled with fluid, right?
>> Right.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.066
>> Elizabeth had a very
significant but localized

21:55.066 --> 21:58.133
problem in her breast that was
treated with a local tissue

21:58.133 --> 22:02.166
procedure, but that doesn't fix
the underlying problem, which

22:02.166 --> 22:06.734
is, the polypropylene implants
are going to continue to cause

22:06.734 --> 22:11.166
fluid to accumulate and wreak
havoc on her breast tissue,

22:11.166 --> 22:15.567
and will predictably result
in a breast disaster for her.

22:15.567 --> 22:20.633
What are your breast goals?
>> It would be nice to have them

22:20.633 --> 22:25.467
be somewhat symmetrical
and not have to do

22:25.467 --> 22:29.633
an invasive surgery.
>> Can we go into the other room

22:29.633 --> 22:34.033
and figure out what is actually
physiologically and anatomically

22:34.033 --> 22:36.066
going on with your breasts?
>> Yes, thank you.

22:36.066 --> 22:38.700
>> This is just a bizarre case,
but let's be honest,

22:38.700 --> 22:43.033
Terry likes the bizarre.
He might be the perfect surgeon

22:43.033 --> 22:45.600
to help Elizabeth.
>> Let's start just by looking

22:45.600 --> 22:51.700
at the overall chest, okay?
Now, what is this Band

22:51.700 --> 22:56.633
>> It's to hold the bump
that I acquired three weeks ago.

22:56.633 --> 22:59.734
>> If the Band-Aid comes off,
what's underneath there?

22:59.734 --> 23:01.233
>> Nothing.
I don't have an open wound.

23:01.233 --> 23:02.600
It's a bump.
>> Can we have a look?

23:02.600 --> 23:04.567
>> Yes.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.633
>> Yeah, you have
a staph infection.

23:08.633 --> 23:10.233
Look at this.
>> Yeah, yeah, that's staph.

23:10.233 --> 23:13.633
>> You have a staph infection.
In a short period of time,

23:13.633 --> 23:17.266
if what I think is going
to happen happens to you,

23:17.266 --> 23:19.200
you will have no breasts.

23:23.767 --> 23:26.667
Let's focus on the medical.
You're going to have

23:26.667 --> 23:31.333
a breast disaster.
>> Okay, so we just

23:31.333 --> 23:35.433
put 20ccs in here.
>> It feels like I have a boob

23:35.433 --> 23:37.367
in both sides of my head.

23:42.633 --> 23:46.033
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪
>> Can we look at the bump?

23:46.033 --> 23:47.300
>> Yes.
>> Yeah, you have

23:47.300 --> 23:50.700
a staph infection.
Elizabeth's breasts are a

23:50.700 --> 23:53.767
complete and utter disaster.
She has a new onset

23:53.767 --> 23:56.400
staph infection.
This just went from bad

23:56.400 --> 24:00.533
to worse in seconds.
Do you want my advice?

24:00.533 --> 24:03.000
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Okay.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Forget about the cosmetic
for a second.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.300
Let's focus on the medical.
You have breasts

24:10.300 --> 24:14.667
that are giving you pain,
that are uneven,

24:14.667 --> 24:20.200
and that, in my opinion,
are truly a ticking time bomb.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.200
I mean truly.
And I think the only hope

24:23.200 --> 24:28.567
to salvage your breasts
is to take the fluid out,

24:28.567 --> 24:30.700
try to get the string out,
take the implant out,

24:30.700 --> 24:35.433
and let things breathe,
and then, hopefully,

24:35.433 --> 24:38.533
you will have some good options
to make you aesthetically

24:38.533 --> 24:40.300
pleasing, symmetrical,
full breasts.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.066
To me, that's the--
not the middle ground--

24:43.066 --> 24:48.033
that's the only ground, because
this is going to a place

24:48.033 --> 24:52.133
you don't want to go.
You're going to have

24:52.133 --> 24:54.033
a breast disaster.

24:58.633 --> 25:05.700
So what do you think about that?
Elizabeth has a very

25:05.700 --> 25:09.066
difficult decision to make.
She has a very significant

25:09.066 --> 25:11.600
breast problem,
but unfortunately, she makes

25:11.600 --> 25:15.033
a living from those breasts.
At the end of the day,

25:15.033 --> 25:18.433
if she isn't living,
she can't make a living

25:18.433 --> 25:22.300
with those breasts.
>> Well, um...

25:22.300 --> 25:26.233

I'm extremely overwhelmed.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.600

>> My goal with Stephanie today

26:14.400 --> 26:18.000
is to try to find out exactly
what's causing her implants

26:18.000 --> 26:23.166
to go up, try to find out
why she's having pain inside,

26:23.166 --> 26:26.367
and then do something about
that lower pull of her breasts,

26:26.367 --> 26:29.567
which is very lose and
essentially is hanging off

26:29.567 --> 26:32.266
of her implants.
For Stephanie's surgery today,

26:32.266 --> 26:35.500
I'll first make incisions
on the bottom of her areolas.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.400
Then I'll open up
the breast pockets, assess

26:38.400 --> 26:41.233
the quality of her tissue,
and weigh whether or not

26:41.233 --> 26:44.233
I'll need to release her muscle,
which I suspect I will.

26:44.233 --> 26:47.300
Next I'll remove her old
implants and replace them with

26:47.300 --> 26:50.033
a new pair which will,
hopefully, relieve Stephanie

26:50.033 --> 26:53.767
of her pain and give her a more
normal-looking breast shape.

26:53.767 --> 26:57.533
Okay, so the first thing
I can see is a shelf of muscle

26:57.533 --> 27:02.133
holding these implants in place.
Yep, there's a little shelving

27:02.133 --> 27:07.533
here, here, here.
Okay, so the muscle

27:07.533 --> 27:10.000
was definitely
inadequately released.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.533
When the surgeon doesn't do
an adequate pectoralis muscle

27:13.533 --> 27:17.000
release, it essentially acts
as a shelf, keeping them

27:17.000 --> 27:21.567
from dropping into the pocket.
So I've released the muscle.

27:21.567 --> 27:26.600
Let's just see what that
maneuver alone does.

27:26.600 --> 27:31.066
So look at that.
That fixes 90% of her problems.

27:31.066 --> 27:35.133
And probably the pain was due
to the fact that the muscle

27:35.133 --> 27:37.667
was just pulling on the side
of her armpit.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.400
I really feel bad for Stephanie,
because she's been living

27:40.400 --> 27:43.066
with this problem for so long,
and it turns out to be

27:43.066 --> 27:47.300
a really simple,
easy problem to fix.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.200
All right, here we go.
Here's the left side.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.633
Yep, look at that.
The first thing I see

27:51.633 --> 27:55.700
when I go inside this pocket
is there's tons of muscle.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.700
Oh, we have a ruptured implant.
Gosh darn it.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.600
All right, we're gonna
have a mess here.

28:01.600 --> 28:09.166
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
All right, here we go.

28:09.166 --> 28:12.567
Ooh.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

28:12.567 --> 28:16.100
if that surgeon did this
when he put it in.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.734
Look at that.
This has been ruptured

28:18.734 --> 28:23.033
a long time.
There's no way of knowing for

28:23.033 --> 28:26.633
sure, but when you see an
implant that's this ruptured,

28:26.633 --> 28:31.633
and the shell is basically
destroyed, it usually indicates

28:31.633 --> 28:35.066
that the implant was ruptured
during insertion.

28:35.066 --> 28:43.333
All right, let's sit this up
and see what this looks like.

28:43.333 --> 28:48.467
Ah, this has this weird,
weird shape thing going on.

28:48.467 --> 28:51.600
A simple release
of the pectoralis major muscle

28:51.600 --> 28:54.233
has had no effect
on the ultimate shape.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.000
They did it improperly
and then it set into place

28:57.000 --> 29:00.500
from the ruptured implant.
The reaction to the rupture

29:00.500 --> 29:04.600
has caused the shape
to be molded into that position,

29:04.600 --> 29:08.100
but I was able to reshape
the breast internally,

29:08.100 --> 29:10.533
and hopefully,
that will fix the problem.

29:10.533 --> 29:15.400
Okay, sit her up.
Let me see what's happened.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.400
So the implant
was sitting on the muscle

32:39.400 --> 32:41.567
and your breast tissue's
down here,

32:41.567 --> 32:43.700
but what was different
on the left side was,

32:43.700 --> 32:46.400
the implant was destroyed.
It ruptured.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.400
When that happens, the body
is aware of it,

32:49.400 --> 32:52.300
and the immune system puts
scar tissue all around that

32:52.300 --> 32:54.734
to try to prevent it
from spreading anywhere.

32:54.734 --> 32:57.734
What that did in your case--
not only put scar tissue there,

32:57.734 --> 33:02.400
but it also ruptured, scarified,
sculpted, weird breast shape.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.667
>> That's crazy.
>> Crazy.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.533
>> Yeah.
When Dr. Dubrow tells me

33:05.533 --> 33:08.667
that my left breast implant
had completely ruptured,

33:08.667 --> 33:12.300
it freaks me out
because I was living with it,

33:12.300 --> 33:15.166
and I would never have known.
It was oddly shaped,

33:15.166 --> 33:17.333
but so was my other one,
so how would I have known

33:17.333 --> 33:19.567
that it was ruptured?
>> Let's see whether

33:19.567 --> 33:23.100
it looks okay.
Oh, my God.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.166
>> Wow.
>> Have you seen these?

33:25.166 --> 33:27.233
>> Yeah.
>> Is this ridiculous?

33:27.233 --> 33:29.200
>> Yes.
Looking down at my breasts,

33:29.200 --> 33:31.600
I'm very happy with the size
and shape of 'em,

33:31.600 --> 33:35.600
and I--I love 'em.
>> Wow. Can I just do one thing

33:35.600 --> 33:39.033
right now?
Pat myself on the back.

33:39.033 --> 33:40.500
>> I'll do it for you.
>> I'm just telling you,

33:40.500 --> 33:42.300
this is...
>> They're gorgeous.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.200
>> Beyond.
>> Thank you.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.367
>> I mean, I never
use this word.

33:46.367 --> 33:48.033
I'm gonna use the P word.
These are, like,

33:48.033 --> 33:51.200
basically perfect.
You never want to say perfect.

33:51.200 --> 33:55.633
As soon as you say perfect,
the complication gods swoop down

33:55.633 --> 34:00.233
from the sky and smack you,
but I said it, because

34:00.233 --> 34:02.667
basically, they kind of
are really perfect right now.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.133
>> Thank you so--
>> Congratulations.

34:04.133 --> 34:06.000
>> Thank you.
Let me give you a hug.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.734
>> Okay.

34:08.233 --> 34:11.233
♪ ♪

34:11.233 --> 34:12.500
>> Hi.
>> Hi, George.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.734
>> Good morning.
How are you today?

34:13.734 --> 34:15.734
I'm here for my second surgery
with Dr. Nassif.

34:15.734 --> 34:17.200
>> Perfect. Go ahead
and sign in.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.667
>> Thank you.
>> I'll let the nurses

34:18.667 --> 34:21.200
know that you're here.
>> I'm really  happy

34:21.200 --> 34:24.100
to get these out of my head
and out of my life.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.734
The scar bothered me,
but not as much

34:25.734 --> 34:28.500
as having two boobs in my head.
>> George.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.400
So here's the question.
>> Yes?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.200
>> Did you walk around
without a hat, like,

34:33.200 --> 34:35.233
out in public?
>> I did a few times.

34:35.233 --> 34:37.367
>> And?
>> And the reaction

34:37.367 --> 34:39.734
was pretty funny.
>> Like, mothers hold their kids

34:39.734 --> 34:43.166
and run away from you or what?
>> A few kids asked their mom,

34:43.166 --> 34:45.233
"Daddy--or, Mommy, what's wrong
with his head?"

34:45.233 --> 34:47.500
>> So you want these out?
>> I want these out more than

34:47.500 --> 34:49.500
I've ever wanted anything.
Please, please.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.266
>> All right,
we'll get them out for you.

34:51.266 --> 34:53.233
>> Thank you.
>> Any time you're doing

34:53.233 --> 34:56.367
a major scar revision
and putting back soft tissue

34:56.367 --> 34:59.133
to make them align
and become symmetric,

34:59.133 --> 35:00.667
it's always tricky.
You know, I want to get

35:00.667 --> 35:02.233
this guy looking good.
He deserves it.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.133
The first step in George's
surgery today is to carefully

35:05.133 --> 35:07.233
make an incision along his
previous scar and remove

35:07.233 --> 35:11.000
the two tissue expanders.
Then I'll excise his scar,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.233
creating a rotation flap
on the left side of his head

35:13.233 --> 35:15.633
and an advancement flap
on the right,

35:15.633 --> 35:18.233
connecting them in the middle.
Once I'm satisfied

35:18.233 --> 35:20.367
that the pieces
are fitting together nicely,

35:20.367 --> 35:23.200
I'll remove any excess skin
and carefully stitch

35:23.200 --> 35:26.200
the two sides together
to avoid any new scarring.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.533
When all is said and done,
the two separated

35:28.533 --> 35:36.667
eyebrow sections will unite back
to one normal brow.

35:36.667 --> 35:41.400
So here's one.
That thing's not even that full.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.266
>> All right, so both
tissue expanders are out.

35:44.266 --> 35:49.133
>> Okay, we're cutting out the
scar right in the upper eyelid

35:49.133 --> 35:53.033
here, so we can put George's
eyebrow here back where

35:53.033 --> 35:56.000
it belongs.
>> Can you open up two--

35:56.000 --> 35:59.567
>> Here, here's the scar.
That deep tissue looks like

35:59.567 --> 36:02.667
where the muscle
that controls elevation

36:02.667 --> 36:05.300
of the eyebrow
is a little bit disinserted.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.166
So I'm want to put a few sutures
back into that and make sure

36:08.166 --> 36:10.100
that's put together well.
It almost appears

36:10.100 --> 36:13.700
that that muscle scarred down
higher than it should be...

36:13.700 --> 36:15.600
>> Yeah.
>> And that controls the eyebrow

36:15.600 --> 36:17.567
from going up and down.
I want to move that muscle

36:17.567 --> 36:20.066
a little bit lower.
My goal isn't to just

36:20.066 --> 36:22.600
make George's eyebrow look good.
It's also to make it

36:22.600 --> 36:24.767
function properly.
Okay, in all these

36:24.767 --> 36:26.467
deep structures,
so we want to secure

36:26.467 --> 36:28.767
all the tissue around
the eyebrow more than anything.

36:28.767 --> 36:31.200
I'm putting, like,
four layers of closure.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.600
All right, so our goal now
is getting the eyebrow

36:33.600 --> 36:36.567
as symmetric as possible,
and that's why putting

36:36.567 --> 36:40.066
these sutures first,
right in the region

36:40.066 --> 36:42.300
of the eyebrow, is key.
That's the tricky part

36:42.300 --> 36:43.567
about this.
>> Yeah.

36:43.567 --> 36:47.533
>> Is making sure that
everything gets perfectly

36:47.533 --> 36:50.600
aligned, because when you have
all this scar tissue,

36:50.600 --> 36:55.233
all the anatomical landmarks
are blurred.

36:55.233 --> 36:57.767
You know, it really takes
a special eye to do

36:57.767 --> 37:02.066
a beautiful scar revision.
His eyebrow looks good.

37:02.066 --> 37:05.467
Now since that's finished,
let's put the forehead scar

37:05.467 --> 37:10.233
back together, and let's remove
any excess scar tissue.

37:10.233 --> 37:13.667
We have to match
every little bit of the forehead

37:13.667 --> 37:16.600
so that the scar
will be minimally visible.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.467
What a patient looks at
is the scar.

37:19.467 --> 37:21.266
They don't look at what was done
underneath the skin,

37:21.266 --> 37:24.500
so we have to be perfectly
precise with every stitch,

37:24.500 --> 37:26.533
because if we do it wrong
we're gonna create

37:26.533 --> 37:29.633
an ugly-looking scar.
Well, George has now

37:29.633 --> 37:38.033
two normal eyebrows.
Thank you all.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.300
>> I'm so excited to see George
after the operation.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.033
He should be coming in
on the bike soon.

37:42.033 --> 37:43.433
>> Well, he better be wearing
a helmet if he's wearing--

37:43.433 --> 37:44.767
>> He's wearing a helmet.
>> If he's taking

37:44.767 --> 37:46.233
the motorcycle.
>> If he's on a bike,

37:46.233 --> 37:48.133
he's definitely wearing it.
>> Are you guys excited

37:48.133 --> 37:50.000
to see Mommy?
>> Mommy.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.367
>> Hi.
>> Hey.

37:52.367 --> 37:54.400
>> What do you think, babe?
>> Oh, my gosh.

37:54.400 --> 38:03.567
You look amazing.
Damn, she looks so good.

38:03.567 --> 38:07.300
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

38:07.300 --> 38:12.467
♪ ♪
>> I feel like I've been waiting

38:12.467 --> 38:15.433
for this for a very long time,
because the first breast

38:15.433 --> 38:18.000
augmentation, I didn't get
what I wanted.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.200
It made me feel just
unattractive, and the pain

38:21.200 --> 38:24.166
was something that affected me
on a day-to-day basis.

38:24.166 --> 38:26.333
>> Come here, Ryder.
Come pop these bubbles.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.333
>> Today I'm meeting my family
at the beach, and it's super

38:29.333 --> 38:31.433
exciting, 'cause it's the first
time that I've been in a

38:31.433 --> 38:35.133
bathing suit for ten years,
and I feel good about myself.

38:35.133 --> 38:37.433
>> Are you guys excited
to see Mommy?

38:37.433 --> 38:40.300
>> Mommy.
>> Hi, guys.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.333
>> Say, "Hi, Mommy."
>> Hi!

38:42.333 --> 38:45.533
>> Hey.
>> What do you think, babe?

38:45.533 --> 38:48.600
>> Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing.

38:48.600 --> 38:53.333
Damn, she looks so good.
I'm just so happy that now

38:53.333 --> 38:56.767
we can move on with our life
and do some of the things

38:56.767 --> 39:00.200
that we wanted to do
like go on vacation.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.300
>> Traveling with the kids
and me not being in pain.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.734
Being able to be
in a bathing suit.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.367
I'm so blessed and thankful
that, you know,

39:08.367 --> 39:10.333
this opportunity
came into our lives

39:10.333 --> 39:13.066
because if not,
I don't think we'd ever get

39:13.066 --> 39:15.300
to do those things.
I'm just thankful

39:15.300 --> 39:19.700
that Dr. Dubrow was able to do
what we thought he could do,

39:19.700 --> 39:22.433
you know, and he did.
He succeeded on all levels.

39:22.433 --> 39:26.200
Prior to the surgery, my breasts
were like saggy baggies.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.367
They were long.
It just made me feel

39:28.367 --> 39:31.433
unattractive, and the worst
part was the pain.

39:31.433 --> 39:33.333
It kept me from doing
the day-to-day things

39:33.333 --> 39:35.467
that I wanted to do
with my family.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.467
After surgery,
my breasts are perky,

39:37.467 --> 39:40.467
and they're the perfect size,
and pain free.

39:40.467 --> 39:43.200
Now I'm able to live
an active life with my family,

39:43.200 --> 39:45.066
and it's amazing.
>> Should we go down there

39:45.066 --> 39:46.500
and check out the water?
>> Yeah.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.533
Now that I'm fixed,
and the pain's gone,

39:48.533 --> 39:52.233
I'm just really excited
to do new things with my family,

39:52.233 --> 39:54.633
and it just makes me
really excited for the future.

39:54.633 --> 40:01.633
>> Here comes a big one.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.667
>> I'm so happy
that this journey

40:03.667 --> 40:14.600
is finally over.
>> Oh, my goodness.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.767
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

40:17.767 --> 40:23.400
♪ ♪
>> The last three years

40:23.400 --> 40:27.266
have been difficult.
I'm so happy and so relieved

40:27.266 --> 40:29.767
that this journey
is finally over.

40:29.767 --> 40:31.500
People don't stare
at me no more.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
I can put
the accident behind me.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.233
I'm getting back on
a motorcycle.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.233
It represents freedom.
It just feels great,

40:39.233 --> 40:44.100
but I've learned to wear
a helmet no matter what.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.367
>> I'm so excited to see George
after the operation.

40:46.367 --> 40:48.100
He should be coming in
on the bike soon.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.500
>> Well, he better be wearing
a helmet if he's wearing--

40:49.500 --> 40:51.000
>> He's wearing a helmet.
>> If he's taking

40:51.000 --> 40:52.233
the motorcycle.
>> If he's on a bike,

40:52.233 --> 40:54.500
he's definitely wearing it.
I remember it like yesterday

40:54.500 --> 40:57.000
when my mom called me
and told me my brother's been

40:57.000 --> 40:59.667
in an accident.
It was the worst moment

40:59.667 --> 41:01.400
in my life.
I was so close

41:01.400 --> 41:05.333
to losing my brother,
and thank God he's okay,

41:05.333 --> 41:10.033
and I'm just excited to see him.
>> To show my brother

41:10.033 --> 41:12.533
and to show my mom
is my happy moment.

41:12.533 --> 41:16.033
We can all celebrate my face,
and my life,

41:16.033 --> 41:21.166
and everything together.
>> I can't wait to see George.

41:21.166 --> 41:22.667
By now he should be
looking awesome.

41:22.667 --> 41:26.400
>> Me too. I can't wait.
>> Yo.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.400
>> Hey!
>> It's a good job, man.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.667
Good, good to see you.
>> Hey.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.133
>> Wow!
>> How do I look?

41:31.133 --> 41:37.734
>> Hey, hey, hey.
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

41:37.734 --> 41:40.166
>> What do you think, Mom?
>> Oh, this is--

41:40.166 --> 41:41.767
>> Be gentle, Mom.
You're gonna break it again.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.433
What do you think?
>> Beautiful.

41:43.433 --> 41:45.166
>> Thank you.
>> Fantastic.

41:45.166 --> 41:49.200
George's scar is gone.
It's not there anymore.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.567
He looks fantastic.
It's like nothing ever happened.

41:52.567 --> 41:54.066
>> Did you expect it
to look this good?

41:54.066 --> 41:55.467
>> Oh, I didn't expect it.
It's like--

41:55.467 --> 41:57.767
>> The scar is--
>> Your eyebrow--your eyebrow is

41:57.767 --> 42:00.633
back exactly 100%.
The scratch,

42:00.633 --> 42:02.200
you can't see anything.
You look fantastic.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.467
>> The scars are gone.
I can feel it.

42:03.467 --> 42:04.734
I haven't felt it for--
>> Can I feel it?

42:04.734 --> 42:06.333
>> Yep.
>> Do you have feeling there?

42:06.333 --> 42:08.233
>> It's not numb anymore,
so I can feel it.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.033
Before my surgery
with Dr. Nassif,

42:10.033 --> 42:12.166
I felt like the poster child
of what happens to you

42:12.166 --> 42:14.700
when you don't wear a helmet.
My left eyebrow was

42:14.700 --> 42:17.200
in two pieces,
and I felt really uncomfortable

42:17.200 --> 42:19.333
wherever I went.
Now since my surgery

42:19.333 --> 42:23.100
with Dr. Nassif, I finally
have just two eyebrows,

42:23.100 --> 42:25.633
and I don't have to remember
my nearly fatal accident

42:25.633 --> 42:29.467
every time I look in the mirror.
So I saw Angelina and Michelle.

42:29.467 --> 42:32.600
