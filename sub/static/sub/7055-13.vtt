00:02.195 --> 00:04.061
What's wrong?
I've just been getting these migraines.

00:04.257 --> 00:05.923
That's all. Tomorrow I'm gonna send
some medication over.

00:05.954 --> 00:07.421
It's a new drug
we've been working on.

00:07.471 --> 00:10.057
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to.

00:10.125 --> 00:12.292
I'm the closest thing
you have to a mother, remember?

00:12.344 --> 00:13.677
In the dreams
that you were having,

00:13.762 --> 00:15.963
the ones that I'm in,
did you feel like you knew me?

00:16.014 --> 00:19.016
You were a stranger.
What would I feel?

00:19.101 --> 00:21.185
I love you.

00:21.269 --> 00:22.987
Look, Peter, I don't know
how to explain it.

00:23.071 --> 00:25.472
Feels like there was
somebody else in my head.

00:25.524 --> 00:27.408
Hi. Come in.

00:27.475 --> 00:29.326
Gonna pour you a drink.

00:29.411 --> 00:30.811
What is that that
smells so fantastic?

00:30.862 --> 00:32.530
What do you mean?
It's Friday.

00:32.613 --> 00:35.315
I ordered Damiano's.

00:35.367 --> 00:38.452
Whoa. Olivia.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.158
<i>Just be straight with me.</i>

00:44.209 --> 00:45.176
<i>Are you okay?</i>

00:45.260 --> 00:48.328
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.647
Then why did you kiss me?

00:53.885 --> 00:55.052
I don't know.

00:55.137 --> 00:56.637
It just felt like
that's what we'd do.

00:56.688 --> 00:59.473
Just felt normal.

01:03.695 --> 01:05.429
How long have we known
each other, Olivia?

01:08.867 --> 01:11.068
Three months.

01:11.153 --> 01:13.037
Peter, I know who you are,
and I know who I am.

01:13.121 --> 01:14.705
I think that this
may just be

01:14.790 --> 01:17.825
some residual effects left over
from being in Westfield.

01:17.876 --> 01:19.710
Then we should let Walter
have a look at you.

01:19.795 --> 01:22.046
No, I'm--I'm fine.
Honestly.

01:22.130 --> 01:26.217
I think what I need
is just some rest.

01:26.301 --> 01:27.551
I'm sorry that I kissed you.

01:27.636 --> 01:31.538
To be honest, I'm a little bit
embarrassed about it.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.390
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

01:36.845 --> 01:38.479
Maybe I should stay here
for a little while--

01:38.546 --> 01:39.814
you know, just while you rest,
in case.

01:39.881 --> 01:42.483
I would really like
some time to myself.

01:42.550 --> 01:46.437
I think I've got another
migraine coming on.

01:50.892 --> 01:52.193
Okay.

01:52.244 --> 01:53.444
If you're still feeling
this way in the morning,

01:53.528 --> 01:55.079
will you please let Walter
take a look at you?

01:55.163 --> 01:57.581

Hmm. Hmm.

06:14.384 --> 06:16.402
So how long has Mr. Keenan
been a patient here?

06:16.486 --> 06:18.688
Sean. About three years now.

06:18.739 --> 06:20.072
Although I'm pretty sure
he spent time

06:20.157 --> 06:21.490
in at least two
other hospitals

06:21.558 --> 06:22.692
before we admitted him.

06:22.743 --> 06:25.227
He's been institutionalized
since he was 14.

06:25.278 --> 06:26.495
<i>These voices he hears--</i>

06:26.563 --> 06:28.781
<i>Are they demons or God or--</i>

06:28.865 --> 06:31.334
<i>Actually, Sean's hallucinations</i>

06:31.401 --> 06:32.918
have never been grandiose
or violent.

06:33.003 --> 06:34.920
Last night was the first time
I've heard him talk like that.

06:35.005 --> 06:37.256
<i>His room is right through here.</i>

06:45.098 --> 06:46.415
I don't understand.

06:46.466 --> 06:48.017
Are you saying the voices
I hear in my head are real?

We don't know what
to think right now.

06:51.772 --> 06:54.573
<i>Now, this is the man</i>
<i>who was killed.</i>

06:54.641 --> 06:56.592
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>seen him before?</i>

06:56.643 --> 06:57.560
No.

06:57.611 --> 06:59.395
But you know
how he died.

07:00.697 --> 07:02.431
I didn't--
I didn't hurt that man.

07:04.067 --> 07:07.119
We know that.

07:07.204 --> 07:09.121
Those--

07:09.206 --> 07:12.375
Voices, they--
they did it.

07:12.442 --> 07:14.276
Sean, can you hear
the voices now?

07:14.327 --> 07:15.961
No.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.279
No, they--
they come and go.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.883
<i>Do they ever come</i>
<i>from objects?</i>

07:20.950 --> 07:22.885
Say, a tree or a wall?

07:22.952 --> 07:24.720
No.

07:24.788 --> 07:25.755
<i>I see.</i>

07:25.806 --> 07:29.725
So they always come
from inside your head.

07:29.793 --> 07:33.962
How many voices
do you hear, Sean?

07:34.014 --> 07:36.182
Uh, I don't know.

07:36.266 --> 07:37.466
I...

07:37.517 --> 07:40.302
I think I recognize eight,
maybe nine.

07:40.353 --> 07:42.021
<i>But not always.</i>

07:42.089 --> 07:46.642
<i>Some of them</i>
<i>I don't hear for weeks.</i>

07:46.693 --> 07:51.013
Last night, how many voices
did you hear?

07:51.081 --> 07:52.415
Three.

07:52.482 --> 07:54.617
<i>That's what the police suspect.</i>

07:54.668 --> 07:55.951
Three killers.

07:56.002 --> 07:57.286
<i>But then one of them left</i>
<i>when the other two</i>

07:57.337 --> 07:58.671
went to the subway station.

07:58.755 --> 08:00.089
The subway station?

08:00.156 --> 08:01.457
<i>Yeah, I heard them say</i>

08:01.508 --> 08:04.126
that one of them was hurt,
like he was cut.

08:04.177 --> 08:06.262
<i>He needed to get cleaned up</i>
<i>before he got on the train.</i>

08:06.329 --> 08:07.263
Cleaned up where?

08:07.330 --> 08:11.684
Uh, he said the bathroom.

08:11.768 --> 08:12.968
It was the last thing
I remember,

08:13.019 --> 08:14.220
and then the sedative
started working,

08:14.304 --> 08:15.971
<i>and I--I fell asleep.</i>

08:16.022 --> 08:17.473
<i>We'll contact</i>
<i>the Transit Authority,</i>

08:17.524 --> 08:22.177
tell them to search the stations
near the victim's home.

08:22.229 --> 08:24.814
Son, do the voices speak
directly to you?

08:24.881 --> 08:27.216
No, they don't.
They don't talk to me at all.

08:27.284 --> 08:28.551
<i>They only speak</i>
<i>to each other?</i>

08:28.618 --> 08:29.518
Yeah.

08:29.586 --> 08:32.871
What are you thinking?

08:32.956 --> 08:35.374
Sean, would you be willing
to go off your meds

08:35.458 --> 08:37.909
if it would help
this investigation?

08:40.246 --> 08:42.030
Here's what
I've been able to get so far,

08:42.082 --> 08:43.916
and I can probably get the rest
of Sean's medical records

08:44.000 --> 08:45.200
within the hour.

08:45.252 --> 08:47.002
Okay, thanks.
I'll make copies.

08:47.053 --> 08:48.888
I believe your diagnosis
of the young man

08:48.972 --> 08:50.139
is fundamentally flawed.

08:50.206 --> 08:52.274
Excuse me?

08:52.342 --> 08:54.209
<i>The truth is that the boy</i>
<i>was diagnosed schizophrenic</i>

08:54.261 --> 08:55.811
<i>because he hears voices.</i>

08:55.879 --> 08:59.014
But the voices
don't persecute him

08:59.065 --> 09:00.566
or relate to him at all.

09:00.650 --> 09:04.019
In fact, recent evidence proves
that what he's hearing

09:04.070 --> 09:06.238
are the real thoughts
of other people.

09:06.323 --> 09:08.073
But how is that possible?

09:08.158 --> 09:10.326
I am not exactly sure yet.

09:10.393 --> 09:13.412
I think it may be a case
of psychological symbiosis,

09:13.497 --> 09:16.115
maybe even mental telepathy.

09:16.199 --> 09:17.666
<i>The point is, I believe</i>

09:17.734 --> 09:21.036
the voices
Sean is hearing exist.

09:21.087 --> 09:23.038
- I'm sorry, what?
- It is no delusion.

09:23.089 --> 09:25.207
No psychotic episode.

09:25.258 --> 09:27.910
Sean has agreed
to go off his medication.

09:27.961 --> 09:31.180
We're hoping that the more
he is able to hear the voices,

09:31.247 --> 09:32.581
the more likely it is
that we will be able

09:32.632 --> 09:36.135
to catch whoever's responsible
for the killing.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.420
Sean is here voluntarily,

09:38.471 --> 09:40.556
so if that's what
he wants to do,

09:40.607 --> 09:44.860
I--I just need to explain this
to his prescribing physician.

09:44.928 --> 09:46.094
Well, I'm happy to come
with you.

09:46.146 --> 09:47.930
I think that's probably
a good idea.

10:02.162 --> 10:03.879
You know what?

10:03.947 --> 10:06.248
Why don't you go on ahead?

10:24.568 --> 10:25.568
Hey.

10:25.635 --> 10:28.470
Hey.

10:28.521 --> 10:31.440
Um, this might be
a little bit weird,

10:31.491 --> 10:32.641
but I was wondering
if I could come in

10:32.692 --> 10:34.977
and just have a look around.

10:35.028 --> 10:37.029
Yeah, of course.

10:37.113 --> 10:38.998
How you feeling?

10:42.919 --> 10:46.505
That's where Walter
used to sleep.

10:46.590 --> 10:49.291
How did you know that?

10:59.603 --> 11:01.103
To disaster
narrowly averted.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.022
Or at least postponed.

11:05.392 --> 11:07.059
We had that case,

11:07.143 --> 11:09.945
that couple
in apartment 6-B.

11:10.013 --> 11:11.530
The woman who lost
her husband.

11:15.035 --> 11:17.987
After, I came back here.

11:20.707 --> 11:22.074
And then we went upstairs.

11:26.663 --> 11:28.914
I remember.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.834
That's not possible.

11:31.885 --> 11:34.420
Peter, I remember William Bell.

11:34.504 --> 11:37.423
I remember crossing over
to bring you back.

11:37.507 --> 11:39.808
<i>I remember Jacksonville</i>

11:39.876 --> 11:44.063
and seeing you shimmer
the first time we kissed.

11:44.147 --> 11:46.315
I remember...

11:46.382 --> 11:49.435
You walking to the machine
and getting inside

11:49.519 --> 11:50.903
and being scared
that you were going to die.

11:50.987 --> 11:52.354
Olivia, I don't know
what's going on,

11:52.405 --> 11:53.722
but something must be wrong.

11:53.773 --> 11:58.193
I remember it.
I remember us.

11:58.244 --> 12:01.196
I remember everything.

12:12.287 --> 12:13.471
<i>Okay.</i>

12:13.556 --> 12:15.757
<i>Tell me your name, please.</i>

12:15.808 --> 12:17.625
Olivia Dunham.

12:17.676 --> 12:20.178
<i>Good.</i>
<i>And your home address?</i>

12:20.262 --> 12:22.931
Walter, I know who I am.

12:22.982 --> 12:24.298
Is this really necessary?

12:24.350 --> 12:27.986
I am just making sure
the machine is calibrated.

12:28.070 --> 12:30.188
And it is.
All right.

12:30.272 --> 12:31.239
<i>Let's see if we can figure out</i>
<i>what's going on</i>

12:31.306 --> 12:32.357
<i>inside your head,</i>

12:32.441 --> 12:33.741
<i>hopefully give you</i>
<i>some peace of mind.</i>

12:33.809 --> 12:35.193
Walter, I'm not scared.
I keep telling you both.

12:35.277 --> 12:37.161
Good.
That makes one of us.

12:37.246 --> 12:39.497
<i>I know that I should be</i>
<i>concerned, but I'm not.</i>

12:39.582 --> 12:42.584
I--I will factor that in
to the diagnosis.

12:42.651 --> 12:45.036
Now shush, please,
both of you,

12:45.120 --> 12:49.173
and let me do my job.

12:49.258 --> 12:50.758
<i>Now, Olivia.</i>

12:50.826 --> 12:52.927
The first time you and I met,
where was it?

12:52.995 --> 12:55.179
St. Claire's.
The mental institution.

12:55.264 --> 12:57.549
<i>And the circumstances</i>
<i>of that visit,</i>

12:57.633 --> 12:58.850
everything you can remember.

12:58.918 --> 12:59.934
<i>My partner had been</i>

13:00.002 --> 13:01.719
injured in an explosion,

13:01.804 --> 13:04.973
<i>and I came to see if you were</i>
<i>able to save his life.</i>

13:05.024 --> 13:08.893
And Peter was with me
because I needed a family member

13:08.978 --> 13:09.944
<i>to sign you out.</i>

13:10.012 --> 13:11.345
No, no.

13:11.397 --> 13:14.065
That's how it happened
in <i>my</i> timeline.

13:14.149 --> 13:15.233
<i>Now, dear,</i>

13:15.317 --> 13:17.735
I want you to think
very carefully.

13:17.820 --> 13:22.189
Do you remember going
to retrieve me from St. Claire's

13:22.241 --> 13:24.358
by yourself, without Peter?

13:27.413 --> 13:28.913
Yes. I got lost
on the way there.

13:28.998 --> 13:30.214
But it's hazy.

13:30.299 --> 13:32.133
<i>It's kind of indistinct,</i>
<i>like a--</i>

13:32.200 --> 13:34.419
like an old dream.

13:34.503 --> 13:37.422
Brain scan?

13:37.506 --> 13:39.257
There's nothing unusual
with the brain scan, Walter.

13:39.341 --> 13:41.392
But clearly,
something is happening.

13:41.477 --> 13:43.478
How can she have memories
of my Olivia's life

13:43.545 --> 13:45.179
that are clearer to her
than her own?

13:45.230 --> 13:48.149
My first thought is empathy.

13:48.216 --> 13:51.986
Even as a child,
you were able to intuit

13:52.054 --> 13:53.988
what those around you wanted.

13:54.056 --> 13:57.191
Belly and I noticed it
during the Cortexiphan trials.

13:57.242 --> 13:59.911
And it's hardly surprising
that children

13:59.995 --> 14:02.580
from abusive families
become highly attuned

14:02.665 --> 14:06.400
to the emotional state
of the adults around them.

14:06.452 --> 14:09.370
Which in this case
is you, Peter.

14:09.421 --> 14:10.288
Me?

14:10.372 --> 14:13.458
Well, I suspect that Olivia

14:13.542 --> 14:16.577
may be empathizing
with your strong desire

14:16.629 --> 14:18.412
to be reunited
with your Olivia.

14:18.464 --> 14:22.083
And she meets that need
by, in effect,

14:22.134 --> 14:25.019
becoming your Olivia.

14:25.087 --> 14:27.305
Walter, no matter how badly
I want my Olivia back,

14:27.389 --> 14:29.256
I can't make this one
have memories of things

14:29.308 --> 14:30.525
she didn't experience.

14:30.592 --> 14:32.927
<i>That part still</i>
<i>confuses me too.</i>

14:32.978 --> 14:36.614
Perhaps some form
of thought transference.

14:36.699 --> 14:39.400
She's channeling
your memories.

14:39.451 --> 14:41.569
Or...

14:44.773 --> 14:46.658
Or what?

14:50.879 --> 14:52.130
Don't know.

14:52.214 --> 14:56.501
I lost the thought.

14:56.585 --> 14:58.920
Too many drugs
of my own.

14:58.971 --> 15:01.139
It happens.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.727
Oh!

15:05.794 --> 15:09.430
May I take a few strands
of your hair to test?

15:09.481 --> 15:13.134
Of course.

15:13.185 --> 15:16.604
Would you hold that
for me, please?

15:25.313 --> 15:26.364
Uh, Peter, would you--

15:26.448 --> 15:28.583
prepare the slide, yeah.

15:31.086 --> 15:32.486
How is she?

15:32.538 --> 15:34.122
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

15:34.173 --> 15:35.373
I feel fine.

15:35.457 --> 15:38.092
That is two pieces
of good news.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.128
Transit authorities found a wad
of bloody paper towels

15:40.179 --> 15:42.013
at the Roosevelt Street
Station bathroom,

15:42.097 --> 15:43.765
just like Sean described.

15:43.832 --> 15:46.184
Now, the DNA analysis suggests
that we're looking

15:46.268 --> 15:47.301
for a Caucasian male,

15:47.352 --> 15:48.770
but so far, no hits
from the database.

15:48.837 --> 15:51.055
May I see the file?

15:51.140 --> 15:52.173
Hey, Lincoln.

15:52.224 --> 15:55.276
Can you give me a hand?

15:55.343 --> 15:56.561
Just a minute.

15:56.645 --> 15:57.695
<i>This DNA report--</i>

15:57.780 --> 15:59.847
<i>I've seen one</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

15:59.898 --> 16:02.183
Where?

16:02.234 --> 16:04.569
Our misdiagnosed schizophrenic,

16:04.653 --> 16:05.536
Sean.

16:05.621 --> 16:07.822
This strand of DNA
is from Sean,

16:07.873 --> 16:10.742
and this from our suspect
at the crime scene.

16:10.826 --> 16:11.726
Now, see that?

16:11.794 --> 16:13.745
They have the same
chromosomal spur.

16:13.829 --> 16:16.581
Which means what?
The effect of the abnormality?

16:16.665 --> 16:17.665
I have no idea.

16:17.716 --> 16:19.634
It may mean nothing
physically,

16:19.701 --> 16:22.086
but the point is
that a spur like this

16:22.171 --> 16:23.638
is incredibly rare,

16:23.705 --> 16:26.373
and they both have
the exact same one.

16:26.425 --> 16:29.310
<i>Which, along with their</i>
<i>genetic profiles,</i>

16:30.979 --> 16:32.980
Sean and our killer
are brothers.

16:33.048 --> 16:34.232
Brothers.

16:34.316 --> 16:35.349
Well, specifically,
half-brothers.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.984
They only share
one parent.

16:37.052 --> 16:38.736
But that gives credence
to my theory

16:38.821 --> 16:41.656
that Sean is communicating
with the killers

16:41.723 --> 16:42.907
via mental telepathy.

16:42.991 --> 16:45.493
There--there are many
documented cases

16:45.560 --> 16:48.196
of siblings communicating
non-verbally,

16:48.247 --> 16:51.199
typically identical twins,
but not always.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.450
That might explain how Sean
is able to hear

16:52.534 --> 16:53.751
the thoughts
of one of the killers.

16:53.836 --> 16:55.253
<i>But he said that he's able</i>
<i>to hear the thoughts</i>

16:55.337 --> 16:56.287
<i>of all three.</i>

16:56.371 --> 16:57.421
What if they're related?

16:57.506 --> 16:58.706
Y-yes.

16:58.757 --> 17:00.007
That would explain--
good.

17:00.075 --> 17:01.342
Except that it doesn't.

17:01.409 --> 17:03.094
According to his medical
records, Sean is an only child.

17:03.178 --> 17:05.096
I'm gonna get my coat.

17:05.164 --> 17:06.380
Where are you going?

17:06.431 --> 17:08.549
To talk to Sean's mother.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.084
Should she be leaving
the lab?

17:10.135 --> 17:12.303
You said there's nothing
wrong with me physically.

17:12.387 --> 17:14.555
<i>So if something shows up</i>
<i>in the tests, let me know.</i>

17:14.606 --> 17:16.691
Otherwise, we've got a case.

17:26.652 --> 17:29.987
I know what you're doing.

17:30.072 --> 17:31.989
I know what it's like
to want something back

17:32.074 --> 17:33.157
that you loved.

17:33.242 --> 17:35.943
I have succumbed
to that temptation myself.

17:35.994 --> 17:38.830
Walter, whatever's happening
to Olivia,

17:38.914 --> 17:39.947
I'm not doing it.

17:39.998 --> 17:41.249
I think you are.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.385
Even without meaning to.

17:44.452 --> 17:47.755
And it's wrong, Peter.

17:56.765 --> 18:00.968
For seven years, he's been
treated for schizophrenia.

18:01.019 --> 18:02.603
If that's not it,
what is it?

18:02.654 --> 18:05.106
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

18:05.157 --> 18:06.891
We've already located
a significant piece

18:06.959 --> 18:09.076
of evidence based on what Sean
told us he heard.

18:09.144 --> 18:11.746
Sean always told me
the voices were real.

18:13.699 --> 18:16.133
Mrs. Keenan, does Sean have
any siblings?

18:16.201 --> 18:18.786
No, we only had
one child.

18:18.837 --> 18:22.323
Is it even in the realm
of possibility

18:22.374 --> 18:24.542
that Sean's father...

18:24.626 --> 18:25.993
Could have had
another child?

18:26.044 --> 18:28.179
His biological father?

18:28.263 --> 18:29.263
Yes.

18:29.331 --> 18:31.265
<i>Sean was conceived</i>

18:31.333 --> 18:33.267
through <i>in vitro</i> fertilization.

18:33.335 --> 18:37.305
<i>We used a donor.</i>

18:37.356 --> 18:38.639
What can you tell us
about the donor?

18:38.690 --> 18:42.059
He seemed impressive
on paper.

18:43.228 --> 18:45.313
Um, what was the doctor's name?

18:45.364 --> 18:46.864
Dr. Owen Frank.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.733
<i>A friend recommended him</i>

18:48.817 --> 18:51.702
<i>when the first</i>
<i>I.V.F. we did failed.</i>

18:51.787 --> 18:53.687
She said he only took
the best donors

18:53.739 --> 18:55.957
so that his results
were better.

18:56.024 --> 18:58.576
<i>It's strange.</i>

18:58.660 --> 19:01.829
A reporter called and left
a message a couple of days ago.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.268
<i>He was doing some sort</i>
<i>of a piece on I.V.F.</i>

19:07.336 --> 19:08.369
What was his name?

19:08.420 --> 19:10.238
Daniel, I think.

19:10.305 --> 19:11.705
Daniel Greene?

19:11.757 --> 19:13.224
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

19:13.308 --> 19:15.326
I called him back,
but he never returned my call.

19:15.394 --> 19:17.178
So you never actually spoke
to him?

19:17.229 --> 19:18.712
<i>No. I did dig up</i>

19:18.764 --> 19:20.564
the file that I kept while I was
going through

19:20.632 --> 19:21.832
the I.V.F. process.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.886
<i>It's in my study.</i>
<i>Let me get it for you.</i>

19:25.938 --> 19:28.489
Thank you.

19:31.526 --> 19:33.227
So in the--
department of strange,

19:33.278 --> 19:34.362
what are we thinking?

19:34.413 --> 19:36.030
That one of these children
killed Greene

19:36.081 --> 19:37.198
because of the story
he was writing?

19:37.249 --> 19:38.232
Maybe.

19:38.283 --> 19:39.700
All right.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.068
I'll contact his editors,

19:41.119 --> 19:42.569
see if they know anything
about his angle.

19:42.621 --> 19:46.040
And anybody else
he may have interviewed.

19:50.929 --> 19:52.763
Tragic news this afternoon--

19:52.848 --> 19:54.332
the murder of a local hero.

19:54.399 --> 19:56.784
Acclaimed author and journalist
Daniel Greene

19:56.852 --> 19:59.186
was found dead in his
Douglaston, New York home

19:59.254 --> 20:00.805
earlier this morning.

20:00.889 --> 20:03.090
Hey, that's the guy
who was here.

20:03.141 --> 20:04.275
The reporter.

20:04.343 --> 20:05.592
..Attacked and killed,
possibly by...

20:05.644 --> 20:07.645
I heard about this
this morning.

20:07.729 --> 20:09.530
Three men broke into his house
and suffocated him

20:09.597 --> 20:12.283
with a plastic bag.

20:12.367 --> 20:13.484
<i>You were a doctor.</i>

20:13.568 --> 20:15.736
How long does it take someone
to suffocate?

20:18.290 --> 20:20.908
I want to go back
to my room.

20:32.671 --> 20:34.839
I'm sorry.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.790
Oh, it's okay.

20:36.842 --> 20:38.059
I don't know what's happening.

20:38.126 --> 20:39.760
It's like I haven't eaten
in years.

20:39.811 --> 20:41.645
Yeah, it's the detox program
that Walter's got you on

20:41.730 --> 20:43.481
to wean you off
your medication.

20:43.565 --> 20:46.434
<i>It's just a side effect.</i>

20:50.322 --> 20:52.273
You're pretty, you know?

20:55.660 --> 20:57.644
Thank you very much.

21:00.782 --> 21:03.000
You trust the scientist?

21:03.085 --> 21:05.252
<i>Walter?</i>

21:05.320 --> 21:06.653
Yeah, I do.

21:06.705 --> 21:09.373
<i>You're in good hands.</i>

21:09.458 --> 21:11.042
<i>When you start to hear</i>
<i>the voices again,</i>

21:11.126 --> 21:13.094
that's how you'll know
that this is working.

21:15.630 --> 21:17.214
<i>Well, in that case,</i>

21:17.299 --> 21:18.733
it's--

21:18.800 --> 21:21.052
it's working now.

21:21.136 --> 21:22.720
W-what,
you can hear them again?

21:28.310 --> 21:30.561
Yes.

21:30.645 --> 21:32.530
Okay.

21:32.614 --> 21:33.781
What are they saying?

21:40.739 --> 21:42.356
I don't--

21:42.407 --> 21:45.192
I don't know.

21:45.243 --> 21:47.528
There are too many of them.

21:55.669 --> 22:03.843
♪

22:34.940 --> 22:36.223
Yeah, I understand

22:36.274 --> 22:37.408
that the clinic closed down
ten years ago,

22:37.492 --> 22:41.562
but that's the most
recent address.

22:41.613 --> 22:43.781
Okay, well, if you find
something more current,

22:43.865 --> 22:46.167
could you let us know?

22:46.234 --> 22:48.586
Yeah, thank you
for your help.

22:51.906 --> 22:53.424
Thank you.

22:55.264 --> 22:56.657
Well, it turns out
that Dr. Frank

22:56.658 --> 22:59.827
was not so good at keeping his
A.M.A. information up to date.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.529
Do you think that
you could go through

23:01.613 --> 23:03.480
these old utility bills
from the clinic?

23:03.532 --> 23:05.116
<i>Maybe there's</i>
<i>a contact in there</i>

23:05.167 --> 23:06.250
that we can follow up on.

23:06.317 --> 23:07.985
Of course.

23:08.036 --> 23:12.923
What?

23:16.161 --> 23:17.795
Maybe I don't
remember everything,

23:17.846 --> 23:19.764
'cause I--I don't remember
you having this scar.

23:19.831 --> 23:24.334
You wouldn't.
I only got that one a month ago.

23:46.291 --> 23:50.795
Olivia--

23:50.862 --> 23:54.381
I think I've had
a breakthrough.

23:58.386 --> 24:00.554
<i>Bees.</i>

24:00.639 --> 24:01.972
Miraculous creatures.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.809
Tens of thousands of them
working together

24:04.876 --> 24:07.561
to feed, shelter,
and protect their colony.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.763
And like our suspects...

24:08.830 --> 24:12.983
They communicate
over long distances.

24:13.051 --> 24:16.353
Their glands
produce pheromones.

24:16.404 --> 24:19.607
Chemical compound
that acts as a message.

24:19.691 --> 24:22.610
That message is received
by their antennae,

24:22.694 --> 24:24.111
and then the bees respond.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.663
Are you suggesting
that the killers

24:25.730 --> 24:27.564
are communicating
via pheromones?

24:27.616 --> 24:29.733
Not necessarily.

24:29.785 --> 24:33.070
Many forms of nonverbal
communication exist in nature.

24:33.121 --> 24:36.173
Eels use electrical pulses,
whales use echolocation,

24:36.241 --> 24:38.626
elephants use
seismic vibrations...

24:38.710 --> 24:39.627
Point, Walter?

24:39.711 --> 24:42.213
Point, Peter...

24:42.264 --> 24:45.382
Is...

24:45.450 --> 24:47.251
However these bees
are communicating,

24:47.302 --> 24:50.087
they are operating as one,
doing whatever it takes

24:50.138 --> 24:52.356
to ensure the survival
of the hive.

24:52.423 --> 24:53.974
If Sean and his
half-brothers

24:54.059 --> 24:56.777
are linked in
a telepathic network,

24:56.862 --> 24:59.563
then it is possible they have
formed a collective identity.

25:02.433 --> 25:06.270
Dunham.

25:06.321 --> 25:08.572
<i>Great.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

25:08.623 --> 25:12.543
Apparently, Dr. Frank is living
at an assisted living facility

25:12.610 --> 25:14.495
outside of Roxbury.

25:14.579 --> 25:18.716
You coming?

25:30.345 --> 25:33.264
There he is, right there.

25:33.315 --> 25:38.185
Thank you.

25:42.824 --> 25:43.858
Uh, Dr. Frank?

25:43.942 --> 25:45.609
Yes?

25:45.660 --> 25:47.244
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham.

25:47.312 --> 25:50.480
I was hoping to ask you a few
questions about your clinic.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.950
Of course.

25:53.001 --> 25:54.235
Uh, there was a man
killed yesterday--

25:54.302 --> 25:55.920
<i>a journalist.</i>

25:55.987 --> 25:58.355
He came to see me
last week.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.090
Wanted to talk
about my research.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.293
<i>My work.</i>

26:02.344 --> 26:05.379
This isn't the first time
that they have killed.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.497
"They"?

26:07.549 --> 26:09.016
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>who they are,</i>

26:09.100 --> 26:13.103
but I have a suspicion.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.471
Three years ago,
I hired someone else.

26:14.522 --> 26:15.873
Another writer.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.408
I wanted to
document my work

26:17.475 --> 26:20.311
before I was
no longer able to.

26:20.362 --> 26:25.115
But the day before we were
meant to start work,

26:25.183 --> 26:26.400
he was also killed.

26:26.484 --> 26:28.485
Stabbed to death
in his apartment.

26:28.536 --> 26:32.039
<i>I thought it was just a--</i>
<i>a random event.</i>

26:32.123 --> 26:36.360
But now, I am
quite sure it wasn't.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.546
What makes you think that?

26:39.631 --> 26:42.032
The work I was doing
at my clinic

26:42.083 --> 26:44.084
is merely a means to an end.

26:44.169 --> 26:48.422
<i>A vehicle for</i>
<i>my real experiments.</i>

26:48.506 --> 26:50.758
<i>What were those</i>
<i>experiments?</i>

26:50.842 --> 26:54.178
Genetic manipulation.

26:54.229 --> 26:57.481
The babies that
I gave life to--

26:57.548 --> 27:00.818
I had altered their DNA.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.520
I thought...

27:04.940 --> 27:06.390
What I thought
really doesn't matter.

27:06.441 --> 27:08.225
Suffice it to say I--

27:08.276 --> 27:12.479
I was attempting
to make a better...

27:12.547 --> 27:14.682
A better what?

27:14.749 --> 27:19.586
A better human being.

27:19.671 --> 27:23.791
<i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with recombinant DNA?</i>

27:23.875 --> 27:26.210
It's a DNA sequence
created in a lab

27:26.261 --> 27:28.262
using the genetic materials
of different species.

27:28.330 --> 27:29.897
Yes.

27:29.965 --> 27:31.748
I used that process

27:31.800 --> 27:34.084
<i>on my subject embryos</i>
<i>that I implanted.</i>

27:34.135 --> 27:36.270
Were your patients aware of
what they were signing up for?

27:36.354 --> 27:39.056
I promised them successful
pregnancies and healthy babies.

27:39.107 --> 27:41.525
<i>And that's</i>
<i>what I gave them.</i>

27:41.592 --> 27:43.944
<i>I attempted</i>
<i>to reintroduce abilities</i>

27:44.029 --> 27:47.064
<i>that we humans have</i>
<i>long since evolved away from,</i>

27:47.115 --> 27:50.267
the hard-wired instincts
that we share

27:50.318 --> 27:51.869
<i>with other animal species.</i>

27:51.936 --> 27:53.404
And would that
include telepathy?

27:53.455 --> 27:54.738
Mm.

27:54.789 --> 27:57.157
<i>And a heightened</i>
<i>protective instinct?</i>

27:57.242 --> 27:59.960
I believe that is why
they are killing, yes.

28:00.045 --> 28:00.944
<i>So, what exactly is it</i>

28:00.996 --> 28:02.413
that they're
trying to protect?

28:02.480 --> 28:04.131
Themselves.

28:04.215 --> 28:08.285
If your work went public, people
would start to ask questions.

28:08.336 --> 28:11.472
And they'd start
searching for them.

28:11.556 --> 28:12.923
And they'd want
to study them.

28:12.974 --> 28:14.458
<i>We're gonna need</i>
<i>a list of your patients.</i>

28:14.509 --> 28:17.061
The clinic's files are

28:17.128 --> 28:19.263
in commercial storage
in Back Bay.

28:19.314 --> 28:22.232
I-I think I have the address
here somewhere.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.651
How many are there?

28:24.736 --> 28:28.605
Subjects?

28:28.656 --> 28:31.325
Approximately 200.

28:31.409 --> 28:34.078
<i>Well, that doesn't conform</i>
<i>with what our witness said.</i>

28:34.145 --> 28:35.829
He didn't hear
that many voices.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.332
<i>I was constantly</i>
<i>modifying the process.</i>

28:38.416 --> 28:42.252
With each modification,
I created another sample group.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.653
And they're all
from the same donor.

28:43.705 --> 28:46.557
All 200.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.425
Yes.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.545
<i>And his information is in</i>
<i>the storage facility also?</i>

28:51.629 --> 28:53.597
No.

28:53.664 --> 28:57.217
It's you, isn't it?

29:00.939 --> 29:03.941
Can you imagine that?

29:04.008 --> 29:08.011
The hubris of trying
to improve upon God?

29:12.734 --> 29:15.202
<i>Okay, uh... we're in trouble,</i>
<i>this--this is bad.</i>

29:15.286 --> 29:16.904
Okay, that's good, Sean,
just stay with them.

29:16.988 --> 29:19.456
They're--they're scared.

29:19.524 --> 29:22.910
They're--they're--they're
worried, they feel threatened.

29:26.915 --> 29:31.885
There's a new voice.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.555
He's one of the three.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.890
He's telling the others
to wait, he's coming.

29:36.975 --> 29:41.728
Where is he?

29:41.813 --> 29:44.598
I don't know,
but he's in pain.

30:08.790 --> 30:09.923
Good God.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.908
Hey.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.043
I just spoke to Olivia.

30:13.094 --> 30:14.211
She's on her way
with Peter

30:14.262 --> 30:15.212
to retrieve Dr. Frank's
research files.

30:15.263 --> 30:17.264
That's not important now.

30:17.348 --> 30:18.632
I need you to take me
to the bridge.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.018
What?

30:21.085 --> 30:23.220
I need to see
Nina Sharp.

30:23.271 --> 30:26.256
I know what's
happening to Olivia.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.296
<i>Walter. Agent Lee.</i>

30:32.381 --> 30:34.465
<i>What a surprise.</i>

30:34.549 --> 30:37.852
Uh, hold all my calls,
please.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.470
So, what is it?

30:39.554 --> 30:41.772
Olivia has Cortexiphan
in her system.

30:41.857 --> 30:43.974
Someone must have found out
how to synthesize it. But how?

30:44.059 --> 30:44.975
No--
and how

30:45.060 --> 30:45.943
Walter, slow down.

30:46.028 --> 30:47.061
What are you saying?

30:47.112 --> 30:48.396
<i>Dr. Bishop believes</i>

30:48.447 --> 30:50.231
that Olivia has been dosed
with Cortexiphan recently.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.932
Recently, and repeatedly.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.150
And you know this
for a fact?

30:53.235 --> 30:55.152
I did a chemical analysis.

30:55.237 --> 30:56.654
The results are
irrefutable.

30:56.738 --> 30:58.122
Well, how is she?
Have you spoken with her?

30:58.206 --> 30:59.423
<i>I examined her.</i>

30:59.491 --> 31:01.275
As far as I can tell,
she's not in immediate jeopardy.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.794
But we need to find out
how this is happening.

31:03.879 --> 31:05.079
Yes, of course.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.882
Where do you store the remaining
Cortexiphan samples?

31:07.949 --> 31:11.085
The ones that
Belly and I kept.

31:11.136 --> 31:13.971
It's possible someone may have
reverse-engineered the formula.

31:14.056 --> 31:18.092
They're at Massive Dynamic,
under our tightest security.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.177
In my experience,
security can be breached.

31:20.262 --> 31:21.395
<i>No, I don't think</i>
<i>you understand.</i>

31:21.463 --> 31:22.596
That's physically
impossible.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.465
The vault is
biometrically secured.

31:24.516 --> 31:28.469
I am the only one
with access.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.071
Could you take us to it?

31:30.138 --> 31:33.307
<i>Belly and I numbered the</i>
<i>samples before we stored them.</i>

31:33.358 --> 31:38.496
If anyone has tampered
with them, I will know.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.998
Fine.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.199
I just need to make
a few phone calls.

31:42.284 --> 31:45.202
No calls.

31:45.287 --> 31:49.490
The less people who know
about this the better.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.178
Let's go.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.806
Okay, unit 2251.

32:05.857 --> 32:10.895
<i>It's gotta be down here.</i>

32:13.148 --> 32:14.815
<i>Look, in case</i>
<i>you were wondering,</i>

32:14.866 --> 32:17.368
it's hard for me too,
you know.

32:17.452 --> 32:18.685
I keep expecting to see
that look in your eye,

32:18.737 --> 32:19.820
and it isn't there.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.706
<i>Or it is, and--</i>
<i>and you're pulling back.</i>

32:22.791 --> 32:25.826
As I'm sure you can
understand, I'm...

32:25.877 --> 32:27.211
Confused.

32:27.295 --> 32:30.364
I'm confused too.

32:30.415 --> 32:31.966
I feel incredibly
close to you.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.385
<i>I feel like I know you better</i>
<i>than anyone else in the world,</i>

32:34.469 --> 32:39.507
and then when you look at me,
it's like none of that is true.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.309
Olivia, I don't know
what you want from me.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.678
I--I want you
to behave naturally.

32:44.729 --> 32:47.648
<i>I want you to--</i>
<i>to treat me</i>

32:47.715 --> 32:49.316
like you know me better than
anyone in the world too.

32:49.384 --> 32:53.988
Because you do.

32:54.055 --> 32:58.909
I think that's the one
we're looking for.

33:00.529 --> 33:03.564
Last time I opened one of these,
it was rigged with Semtex.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.866
You mean with John Scott?

33:05.917 --> 33:07.751
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:07.836 --> 33:08.735
How'd you know
it was Semtex?

33:08.787 --> 33:10.621
Uh, because
when we were trying

33:10.705 --> 33:12.706
to figure out
what happened to him,

33:12.757 --> 33:15.075
we traced it back to
a munitions trader in Hong Kong.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.294
Why?

33:17.379 --> 33:21.932
'Cause I didn't know it was
Semtex until right now.

33:22.017 --> 33:23.884
Okay.

33:23.935 --> 33:27.938
Meaning Walter's theory
can't possibly be right.

33:28.023 --> 33:29.756
I'm not projecting
my memories onto you.

33:29.808 --> 33:34.528
You can't have memories
that I've never had.

33:42.937 --> 33:45.239
I don't understand
how this is happening.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.624
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>it either.</i>

33:46.708 --> 33:50.661
But whatever this is,

33:50.745 --> 33:53.297
whatever the cause,

33:53.381 --> 33:57.134
I told you I'm not scared.

33:57.219 --> 34:02.423
I like the feeling.

34:09.848 --> 34:13.650
It's unlocked.

34:13.735 --> 34:16.020
They feel threatened.
They need to stop someone.

34:16.103 --> 34:16.987
Okay, stop. Who?

34:17.072 --> 34:21.659
They're gonna kill her.

34:26.364 --> 34:29.083
Sean, who?

34:34.089 --> 34:35.656
<i>Someone got here before us.</i>

34:36.791 --> 34:38.458
Dunham.

34:38.510 --> 34:42.545
Olivia, they know
that you're there.

34:59.648 --> 35:00.531
Dr. Owen Frank, please.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.316
He's on the third floor.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.234
Here, let me show you.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.995
If you're looking
for Mr. Dubrow,

35:15.046 --> 35:18.048
he's moved
three doors down.

35:24.005 --> 35:26.840
You're...

35:26.908 --> 35:30.811
You're mine.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.436
No.

35:39.521 --> 35:43.774
He's right in here.

35:43.858 --> 35:46.744
Dr. Frank. Boston P.D.

35:46.828 --> 35:48.996
Dr. Frank.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.285
Lock down the facility.

36:09.838 --> 36:12.339
I told you, Sean,
it's too loud.

36:12.407 --> 36:15.459
I prefer it on.
Will you turn it on?

36:18.263 --> 36:19.379
Turn it on.

36:19.447 --> 36:21.415
Sean--
<i>Sean.</i>

36:22.211 --> 36:24.991
What's wrong?

36:24.992 --> 36:29.796
I can't hear them.

36:29.863 --> 36:30.863
When I couldn't
hear them before,

36:30.915 --> 36:33.333
there was a feeling
that they were...

36:33.384 --> 36:36.803
with me.

36:36.870 --> 36:39.705
Like when s--you know
someone's in the room,

36:39.757 --> 36:41.207
even if you can't see 'em.

36:41.258 --> 36:44.594
Okay.

36:44.678 --> 36:47.313
This is different.

36:47.381 --> 36:50.600
They're gone.

36:50.684 --> 36:53.219
There's nothing anymore.

36:53.270 --> 36:57.740
Just silence.

36:57.808 --> 37:00.226
Why?

37:00.277 --> 37:02.162
I don't know.

37:02.229 --> 37:05.915
The truth is
we may never know.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.837
But I can understand
why silence would scare you.

37:12.026 --> 37:16.486
You're not used to
being by yourself.

37:16.488 --> 37:20.241
But this is normal.

37:24.294 --> 37:25.878
It was so loud for you

37:25.946 --> 37:30.466
that you couldn't even
hear yourself think.

37:32.352 --> 37:36.105
And I bet you have
a lot of great thoughts.

38:00.247 --> 38:03.115
<i>So destroying the records</i>
<i>and killing the doctor,</i>

38:03.166 --> 38:04.300
<i>you think Walter</i>
<i>was right?</i>

38:04.384 --> 38:07.169
<i>You think they were just</i>
<i>protecting the hive?</i>

38:11.925 --> 38:13.893
You thinking that this job
just can't get any weirder?

38:13.960 --> 38:17.313
Yeah.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.902
No.

38:22.969 --> 38:26.355
That's not what
I was thinking.

38:26.440 --> 38:30.309
It's...
It's just that

38:30.360 --> 38:31.744
now the case is over,

38:31.811 --> 38:34.997
we would go back to one of
each other's houses.

38:35.082 --> 38:37.500
<i>I know that that's</i>
<i>what we would do.</i>

38:37.584 --> 38:39.368
<i>That was one of the things</i>
<i>that we would do.</i>

38:39.453 --> 38:42.204
<i>I know that.</i>

38:42.289 --> 38:44.290
So now, I don't know

38:44.357 --> 38:47.543
<i>if I'm just supposed to</i>
<i>ignore that, or what you want,</i>

38:47.627 --> 38:49.929
and I guess I just--

38:49.996 --> 38:52.164
I--Peter, how do you
want to play this?

38:52.215 --> 38:53.966
Olivia--
Look, you don't have to answer now.

38:54.017 --> 38:55.768
I just want you to think about it.
Olivia.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.337
I'm thinking about it.

38:58.405 --> 39:03.359
It's all I've been
thinking about.

39:03.443 --> 39:07.346
And I'm afraid.

39:07.397 --> 39:10.750
I'm afraid because
I've made this mistake before.

39:10.817 --> 39:15.988
I betrayed the Olivia
that I love.

39:22.245 --> 39:26.882
But what I'm really
afraid of is...

39:26.967 --> 39:31.504
When I look into your eyes,
I know it's you.

39:31.555 --> 39:36.976
I know it's you.

39:58.665 --> 40:02.751
I just gotta, um...

40:02.836 --> 40:07.039
I just gotta go pee.

40:38.989 --> 40:41.207
Biometric hand scanner,
like I said.

40:41.274 --> 40:46.161
Second-tier precaution.

40:57.790 --> 40:58.841
There.

40:58.925 --> 41:03.646
20 vials present
and accounted for.

41:03.730 --> 41:05.764
They're all here.

41:05.815 --> 41:08.901
Mm-hmm.

41:11.988 --> 41:13.572
Now let's focus
on the real problem.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.407
<i>What's happening</i>
<i>to Olivia?</i>

41:15.475 --> 41:18.193
We've already given you all the
details we know about so far.

41:18.278 --> 41:21.413
<i>Where is she?</i>
<i>I'd like to see her.</i>

41:21.481 --> 41:22.698
<i>Can I speak with her?</i>

41:22.782 --> 41:24.316
This is not Cortexiphan.

41:24.367 --> 41:26.752
What are you talking about?

41:26.819 --> 41:30.339
<i>It's potassium iodide</i>
<i>with food coloring.</i>

41:30.423 --> 41:32.958
Red #4.

41:33.009 --> 41:38.013
The Cortexiphan
has been replaced.

42:04.574 --> 42:07.209
'Scuse me.

42:07.294 --> 42:09.578
The, uh, girl who came
in here a couple minutes ago,

42:09.663 --> 42:10.996
about yea tall, blonde.

42:11.047 --> 42:14.633
I'm sorry, I--
I didn't see her.

42:30.883 --> 42:33.402
<i>Olivia?</i>

42:33.486 --> 42:36.572
<i>Oh, God.</i>

42:36.656 --> 42:40.909
<i>Olivia?</i>

42:40.994 --> 42:44.613
<i>Did they hurt you?</i>

42:44.698 --> 42:45.614
Nina?

42:45.699 --> 42:49.702
Shh, it's okay.

42:49.753 --> 42:53.505
<i>We're gonna be okay.</i>

42:53.573 --> 42:58.961
We're gonna be okay.
