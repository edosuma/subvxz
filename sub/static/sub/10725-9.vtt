00:01.921 --> 00:04.222
Over 68 million Americans

00:04.256 --> 00:07.058
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:07.092 --> 00:08.559
If danger strikes,

00:08.594 --> 00:11.062
the FBI's international response team

00:11.096 --> 00:13.131
is called into action.

00:22.574 --> 00:25.076
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

00:43.362 --> 00:45.964
Thank you for calling
the Peters residence.

00:45.998 --> 00:47.365
Please leave your name and number,

00:47.399 --> 00:48.399
and we'll get back to you.

00:48.434 --> 00:52.737
Hey, Mom, Dad, I'm fine.

00:52.771 --> 00:54.706
I'm safe.

00:54.740 --> 00:57.408
You don't have to worry about me, okay?

01:08.921 --> 01:10.455
Look.

01:10.489 --> 01:13.358
I'll explain everything
to you guys soon.

01:17.696 --> 01:19.564
I love you.

01:19.598 --> 01:21.165
And I...

01:21.200 --> 01:23.401
oh.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.670
Yeah, hi. I'm Emma. I'm here to see...

01:25.704 --> 01:27.772
No!

01:27.806 --> 01:30.174
And the recording ends there.

01:30.209 --> 01:32.243
16-year-old Emma
Peters' cellphone

01:32.277 --> 01:34.779
last pinged in Antalya,
Turkey, five hours ago.

01:34.813 --> 01:36.180
Her parents, Glenn and Stephanie,

01:36.215 --> 01:37.949
thought that she had gone to school,

01:37.983 --> 01:39.817
but instead, she'd
driven to Dulles Airport

01:39.852 --> 01:42.153
and used her credit card to
buy a one-way ticket to Turkey.

01:42.187 --> 01:44.122
Every parent's worst nightmare.

01:44.156 --> 01:47.492
I take it Emma never exhibited
this kind of behavior before?

01:47.526 --> 01:50.461
Never. Uh, she's a straight-"a"
student, cheerleader,

01:50.496 --> 01:53.031
student council, lots of
extracurricular activities.

01:53.065 --> 01:54.632
So why would Emma fly to Turkey?

01:54.666 --> 01:55.633
Her parents are convinced

01:55.667 --> 01:58.202
that it has to do with
a boy named Emir Bayar,

01:58.237 --> 02:00.004
a 17-year-old Turkish
exchange student

02:00.039 --> 02:02.106
who Emma fell hard for last semester.

02:02.141 --> 02:03.708
According to this school report,

02:03.742 --> 02:06.978
Emir Bayar was suspended for an
assault against another student.

02:07.012 --> 02:08.979
His student visa was rescinded,

02:09.014 --> 02:11.382
and he was immediately sent
back to his home in Antalya.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.818
So what are we thinking...
this Emir kid lures Emma

02:13.852 --> 02:15.620
with the promise of a romantic reunion

02:15.654 --> 02:17.822
and then pulls a
bait-and-switch?

02:17.856 --> 02:20.324
Love is very powerful,
especially your first love.

02:20.359 --> 02:22.226
It's an impulsive force.

02:22.261 --> 02:25.129
You know, the language barriers
in Turkey, we can deal with.

02:25.164 --> 02:27.365
But what concerns me
is the cultural barrier

02:27.399 --> 02:29.367
and how that will
affect Emma's recovery.

02:29.401 --> 02:30.668
What do you mean?

02:30.702 --> 02:32.303
Well, for one thing, the Antalya police

02:32.337 --> 02:34.205
have listened to
Emma's voice-mail here,

02:34.239 --> 02:35.406
and they don't seem to think

02:35.441 --> 02:37.208
it suggests any evidence of a crime.

02:37.242 --> 02:40.511
They think it might rise to
the level of a lover's quarrel.

02:40.546 --> 02:42.480
What we consider domestic violence

02:42.514 --> 02:44.682
isn't a criminal act in Turkey.

02:44.716 --> 02:48.219
Monty, have our legat meet us
on the ground at Antalya airport.

02:48.253 --> 02:50.822
He should liaise with the
Turkish National Police.

02:50.856 --> 02:51.856
Done and done.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.492
I want to bring them on
board soon as we land.

02:54.526 --> 02:57.528
We'll use the jet as a base
of operations while in country.

02:57.563 --> 02:59.597
Operational security is Paramount.

02:59.631 --> 03:02.433
- Monty, I want you also to...
- Dig into Emma's online

03:02.468 --> 03:04.836
and personal communications
with this Emir Bayar fellow?

03:04.870 --> 03:06.337
Get on it.

03:06.371 --> 03:09.740
Abduction without a ransom demand.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.342
I mean, she could already be dead.

03:11.376 --> 03:13.678
No, I'm not inclined to think
that Emir would lure Emma

03:13.712 --> 03:15.913
halfway around the
world just to kill her.

03:15.948 --> 03:16.981
She's alive.

03:17.015 --> 03:19.450
The question is is Emir
keeping her for himself

03:19.485 --> 03:22.386
or planning to offer
her to someone else?

03:22.421 --> 03:24.789
Either way, time is of the essence.

03:37.402 --> 03:39.070
Please!

03:39.104 --> 03:41.439
Please.

03:41.473 --> 03:44.008
Please don't hurt me. Please.

03:46.645 --> 03:48.246
Hello, Emma.

03:50.482 --> 03:53.170
We've been waiting for you.

A Turkish proverb tells us,

04:17.182 --> 04:19.083
"who has never been burned in the sun

04:19.117 --> 04:21.786
won't know the value of shadow."

04:30.195 --> 04:33.097
Everyone, this is Dale
Hanah, our legal attache.

04:33.131 --> 04:34.999
- As-salam alaykum.
- Alaykum salam.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.267
Welcome to Turkey.

04:36.301 --> 04:39.136
Agents Simmons, Seger, and Jarvis.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.604
- Pleasure to meet you all.
- Hi.

04:40.639 --> 04:42.673
I've heard great things
from Jack about you.

04:42.707 --> 04:44.608
Yeah, you, too. We hear
you guys go way back.

04:44.643 --> 04:47.311
Yes, we were roommates
back at the FBI academy.

04:47.345 --> 04:49.213
What was it... class of '95-14?

04:49.247 --> 04:51.282
Yeah. How did we get here from there?

04:51.316 --> 04:53.884
The future has not been written.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.220
There is no fate but what we make.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.222
That's beautiful. Is
that from the Qur'an?

04:58.256 --> 04:58.989
"Terminator 2."

04:59.024 --> 05:01.025
Oh, I knew it sounded familiar.

05:02.527 --> 05:04.161
You ready to bring us up to speed?

05:04.196 --> 05:05.563
Of course.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.498
Although the Turkish National Police

05:07.532 --> 05:10.301
are not treating Emma Peters'
disappearance as a crime,

05:10.335 --> 05:13.037
they were cooperative enough
to give me some information.

05:13.071 --> 05:14.705
It looks as though Emma's passport

05:14.739 --> 05:17.341
was digitally scanned at the
Antalya Airport 12 hours ago.

05:17.375 --> 05:21.245
It was. And you can see
from the security stills

05:21.279 --> 05:23.047
she left the airport in a taxi cab.

05:23.081 --> 05:24.515
For a girl who's never been to Turkey,

05:24.549 --> 05:26.183
she looks like she
knows where she's going.

05:26.218 --> 05:27.551
Well, the cab driver was interviewed.

05:27.586 --> 05:29.053
It says that he drove
Emma to the intersection

05:29.087 --> 05:31.255
of Hesapki and Kocatepe Streets.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.691
And that's all he saw.
There's no more eyewitnesses.

05:33.725 --> 05:35.693
Dale, you said the Turkish police

05:35.727 --> 05:37.228
were somewhat more cooperative.

05:37.262 --> 05:39.563
That mean they're prepared
to shadow our investigation?

05:39.598 --> 05:41.232
They'll provide us with escorts,

05:41.266 --> 05:45.102
but, honestly, they think
we're wasting our time.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.438
Simmons and Mae, you take
Emma's last known location.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.340
Clara and I will see
if we can track down

05:49.374 --> 05:51.442
Emir Bayar's last known address.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.678
If she came here to see
him, we may just get lucky.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.185
If Emma's lost in Turkey,

06:01.219 --> 06:03.053
how can you even begin to find her?

06:03.088 --> 06:05.789
Mrs. Peters, let me assure
you and your husband,

06:05.824 --> 06:08.125
in the last year alone, we
have successfully resolved

06:08.160 --> 06:11.428
27 non-familial
abductions on foreign soil.

06:11.463 --> 06:12.930
This never would have happened

06:12.964 --> 06:15.099
if we hadn't let her see that kid.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.201
How could we have known, Glenn?

06:17.235 --> 06:19.637
Agent Montgomery, we didn't
want to push our daughter away.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.106
It's just...

06:22.140 --> 06:24.041
She and Emir had nothing in common.

06:24.075 --> 06:26.310
They... they were from different worlds.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.080
And when Emir beat up that kid
at school, we put our foot down.

06:30.115 --> 06:31.282
So as far as you know,

06:31.316 --> 06:33.250
Emma and Emir have not been in contact

06:33.285 --> 06:34.919
since his student visa was taken away?

06:34.953 --> 06:37.254
Absolutely not.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.723
We even monitored her computer time.

06:39.758 --> 06:42.626
Were you able to bring
Emma's laptop, as I requested?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.765
But you won't find anything on it.

06:47.799 --> 06:49.767
We, uh, checked her browser histories

06:49.801 --> 06:51.335
and her e-mails every day.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.103
I'm sure you did.

06:53.138 --> 06:54.171
I just need to make sure

06:54.206 --> 06:56.440
there isn't any other
digital information on here

06:56.474 --> 06:58.909
that may suggest her
whereabouts right now.

06:58.944 --> 07:00.611
Thank you.

07:29.207 --> 07:30.507
Again...

07:30.542 --> 07:34.311
I'm very sorry for these
circumstances, Emma.

07:34.346 --> 07:37.314
And for not properly
introducing myself before.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.817
I'm Abu Hakim Al Badi,

07:39.851 --> 07:42.353
a close friend of Emir's.

07:42.387 --> 07:46.690
If you're such a close friend,
why didn't he tell me about you?

07:46.725 --> 07:48.792
Why are you doing this to me?

07:48.827 --> 07:51.795
I realize you've traveled a
very long way to be with Emir,

07:51.830 --> 07:55.032
and I know how much you mean to him.

07:55.066 --> 07:56.867
But you must understand,

07:56.901 --> 08:00.537
I will not allow anyone
to do harm to Emir.

08:00.572 --> 08:03.007
Harm?

08:03.041 --> 08:04.341
That's not why I'm here.

08:04.376 --> 08:06.343
I would never hurt Emir. He's...

08:06.378 --> 08:07.645
Emma!

08:07.679 --> 08:10.247
Why did you bring your phone with you,

08:10.282 --> 08:13.917
when you were told very
specifically not to do so?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.220
I just wanted to call my
parents when I got here

08:16.254 --> 08:17.855
to make sure they wouldn't worry...

08:17.889 --> 08:19.657
Weren't you told...

08:19.691 --> 08:23.260
For Emir's own protection,
that you needed to follow

08:23.295 --> 08:27.898
each and every one of his
instructions without fail?

08:27.932 --> 08:29.333
Yes. But...

08:29.367 --> 08:32.903
Emir needs to be able to trust you.

08:32.937 --> 08:35.005
He can!

08:35.039 --> 08:36.974
We shall see.

08:39.210 --> 08:43.212
Why does Emir need protection?

08:43.248 --> 08:45.215
Emir is a very...

08:45.250 --> 08:48.385
Special person, Emma.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.754
You are privileged to know him.

08:50.789 --> 08:53.090
Yes. I am.

08:53.124 --> 08:55.159
When can I see Emir?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.968
Okay. Now, if I was a teenage girl,

09:05.003 --> 09:07.304
how would I choose to hide
my secret communication

09:07.339 --> 09:09.873
with my super-secret boyfriend?

09:13.578 --> 09:15.579
Hello.

09:15.613 --> 09:18.148
Why hide a calculator app?

09:18.183 --> 09:21.985
Unless it holds the
combination key to your heart.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.022
E.M.I.R.

09:27.092 --> 09:30.260
Bingo.

09:30.295 --> 09:31.762
60 seconds.

09:31.796 --> 09:34.131
Must be getting slower.

09:34.165 --> 09:35.466
Also must be getting senile,

09:35.500 --> 09:38.102
'cause now I'm talking to myself.

10:03.962 --> 10:05.362
You got something, Monty?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.965
Emma Peters overt computer
accounts were clean,

10:07.999 --> 10:09.633
but she did maintain a very active,

10:09.667 --> 10:11.368
very on the down-low online life.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.271
So let me guess. She continued
to communicate with Emir

10:14.305 --> 10:16.373
even after he was kicked
out of the country.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.442
Yes and no. See, Emma
reached out to Emir

10:18.476 --> 10:20.177
through various social media sites,

10:20.211 --> 10:22.446
but he never responded for like a month.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.481
Then some guy named Hanim Atvan,

10:24.516 --> 10:26.817
who claims to be a friend
of Emir, reached out to her.

10:26.851 --> 10:28.519
Emir was probably a little gun-shy

10:28.553 --> 10:30.020
after his run-in with the authorities.

10:30.054 --> 10:32.556
So he uses his friend
Hanim to test the waters.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.858
Monty, how long were they
communicating with each other

10:34.893 --> 10:36.460
before she flew to Turkey?

10:36.494 --> 10:37.661
Uh, six months.

10:37.695 --> 10:41.331
Hanim regaled Emma with stories
of how much Emir missed her

10:41.366 --> 10:43.467
and how much he wanted to
come to the United States

10:43.501 --> 10:45.402
and see her, et cetera, et cetera.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.504
Hanim strung her along
with this expectation.

10:47.539 --> 10:50.340
Then I'll bet he said Emir
couldn't come to the U.S.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.843
That way, she volunteered to
come to Turkey and see him.

10:52.877 --> 10:54.011
You are correct.

10:54.045 --> 10:55.679
That's a classic takeaway tactic

10:55.713 --> 10:58.382
used by salesmen and con men worldwide.

10:58.416 --> 11:01.585
Yeah, but even more than that,
Hanim spelled out for Emma

11:01.619 --> 11:04.688
exactly what to do and not
to do when coming over there.

11:04.722 --> 11:07.224
No cellphone. Dress like a tourist.

11:07.258 --> 11:08.859
Buy a plane ticket at the last minute

11:08.893 --> 11:10.527
so no one had a chance to find out.

11:10.562 --> 11:12.429
She was definitely manipulated.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.531
Thanks, Monty.

11:14.566 --> 11:17.701
You know, Emir could be
pretending to be this Hanim kid.

11:17.735 --> 11:20.671
Yes, he could.

11:20.705 --> 11:23.440
Our escort's arrived.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.542
Let's go find Emir.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.388
_

11:32.626 --> 11:33.626
_

11:33.738 --> 11:35.981
_

11:38.034 --> 11:38.837
_

11:39.457 --> 11:42.693
American. FBI.

11:42.727 --> 11:44.595
You leave our son alone.

11:44.629 --> 11:45.963
Emir is not here.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.799
Mr. and Mrs. Bayar,
Emma Peters is missing.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.267
We know your son knew her well

11:50.301 --> 11:52.069
when he was in the United States.

11:52.103 --> 11:54.137
And we know they've
continued to communicate.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.441
Lies. That girl got our
son into terrible trouble.

11:57.475 --> 12:00.277
So we made sure Emir would
never have any contact

12:00.311 --> 12:01.345
with her ever again.

12:01.379 --> 12:03.981
Why do you want to save
that whore over our son?!

12:04.015 --> 12:06.550
Mother, please!

12:06.584 --> 12:07.951
Emir Bayar?

12:07.986 --> 12:10.487
Yes.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.624
So, Emma goes missing in the U.S.,

12:13.658 --> 12:16.260
and the FBI flies around
the world just to accuse me?

12:16.294 --> 12:18.929
We have communications between
Emma and your friend Hanim

12:18.963 --> 12:23.133
who asks her, on your behalf,
to fly here to Turkey to see you.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.068
Emma came here?

12:25.103 --> 12:26.570
And now she's gone.

12:26.604 --> 12:28.572
I do not understand this.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.474
I do not even know anyone named Hanim.

12:30.508 --> 12:32.809
Emir, let's not play games.
We know about the assault

12:32.844 --> 12:34.611
that led to your student
visa being revoked.

12:34.646 --> 12:36.680
I was protecting Emma's honor.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.881
On day after school,

12:37.916 --> 12:41.618
some guys started hassling her
for hanging with the rag head.

12:41.653 --> 12:42.753
One of them tried to grab her.

12:42.787 --> 12:46.023
The other took a swing at
me, so I busted open his nose.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.057
Defending Emma's honor

12:47.091 --> 12:49.593
isn't exactly how school
administrators put it.

12:49.627 --> 12:52.462
You do not think it is
possible those people lied?

12:52.497 --> 12:54.631
So you've had no
communications with Emma

12:54.666 --> 12:56.500
since you returned from the U.S.?

12:56.534 --> 12:58.602
It was not by choice.

12:58.636 --> 13:00.604
My parents... they were not lying

13:00.638 --> 13:02.806
when they told you they forbid it.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.642
And you're not familiar with
anyone by the name of Hanim?

13:05.677 --> 13:07.611
No. I am not.

13:07.645 --> 13:10.514
Honestly, I never told any
of my friends about Emma.

13:10.548 --> 13:12.716
If she's in trouble,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.285
I'll do whatever I can to help.

13:18.389 --> 13:21.191
Looks like we may have hit
a dead end with Emir Bayar.

13:21.225 --> 13:22.459
So whoever this Hanim guy is,

13:22.493 --> 13:25.562
he must have seen Emma's posts
and searches for Emir online.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.030
And he set his sights on her.

13:27.065 --> 13:29.299
If this isn't about reuniting with Emir,

13:29.334 --> 13:31.635
then what does Hanim
have in mind for Emma?

13:31.669 --> 13:35.305
There are a few possibilities,
and none of them good.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.174
Let's hope you're
about to find something.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.809
Call you as soon as we do, boss.

13:39.744 --> 13:41.812
This is where the taxi dropped off Emma.

13:41.846 --> 13:43.914
Okay, so Monty was able
to remove Emma's voice

13:43.948 --> 13:45.749
from the answering machine message

13:45.783 --> 13:47.918
and then boost the background
and the ambient noise.

13:53.057 --> 13:54.591
So if this place is true to pattern,

13:54.626 --> 13:57.194
then Emma didn't go very far
from these street musicians.

13:58.062 --> 14:00.397
And that buzz sounds almost like a...

14:00.431 --> 14:02.666
Building with a secure entrance.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.836
Something with remote access control.

14:05.870 --> 14:09.206
It looks like we have a
couple of those on this block.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.274
Keep playing it a little further.

14:13.277 --> 14:16.446
Wow, that almost sounds like...

14:16.481 --> 14:18.015
An industrial sewing machine.

14:18.049 --> 14:21.618
Yeah, which I don't
see or hear around here.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.754
That is why...

14:23.788 --> 14:26.456
I brought my shooter's headphones.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.358
Amplifies the ambient sound,

14:28.393 --> 14:31.395
blocks out the higher decibel noises.

14:38.736 --> 14:42.973
This is it. This is it.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.779
Emma's breaths are getting deeper.

14:48.813 --> 14:50.947
She took the stairs.

15:00.591 --> 15:03.593
- Yeah, the footsteps end...
- shh, shh, shh.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.752
Where is she?!

15:28.786 --> 15:31.154
Where is Emma Peters?!

15:37.694 --> 15:40.362
The place is empty, but
she was definitely here.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.764
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:41.798 --> 15:43.365
We found this.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.167
Cracked cellphone case.

15:45.202 --> 15:46.102
It's Emma's.

15:46.136 --> 15:48.003
There was a couple
empty beds in the room.

15:48.038 --> 15:49.939
Could have been used as
some kind of a way station.

15:49.973 --> 15:51.507
On the road to where?

15:51.541 --> 15:53.442
All right. Turkish Intelligence,

15:53.477 --> 15:54.910
they identified our guy back there.

15:54.945 --> 15:56.779
His name is Marko Bashir.

15:56.813 --> 15:58.347
Iraqi National.

15:58.381 --> 15:59.682
Well, his left hook says

15:59.716 --> 16:01.617
he's probably not the
brains behind all this.

16:01.651 --> 16:02.551
Yeah, I would agree.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.454
The Turks have him
pegged as a smuggler...

16:05.489 --> 16:07.656
weapons and women.

16:14.397 --> 16:16.699
That's some callus on your forehead.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.734
Take his shoes off.

16:24.407 --> 16:26.809
As well as on your feet.

16:26.843 --> 16:29.745
Calluses earned from
years of rigorous prayer.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.782
Many of my devout friends,
they have marks like this.

16:32.816 --> 16:35.317
It comes from hours and
hours of sitting on your feet

16:35.352 --> 16:37.419
and pressing your
forehead to the rug, but...

16:37.454 --> 16:38.888
they're not smugglers,

16:38.922 --> 16:41.624
who also see themselves
as true believers.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.659
Extremists like this, they make me sick.

16:45.761 --> 16:47.663
_

16:47.697 --> 16:49.665
Desecrate Islam.

16:49.699 --> 16:51.066
Twisting the words of Allah

16:51.101 --> 16:54.170
into a call for
criminality and violence.

16:54.204 --> 16:55.404
Jack, if this guy's a terrorist,

16:55.438 --> 16:58.407
he could have taken Emma to
be a sex slave or a war bride.

16:58.441 --> 17:00.843
Which means she could be
all the way to Syria by now.

17:00.877 --> 17:02.144
Damn it.

17:02.179 --> 17:04.180
Emma was gone before we even got here.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.214
What do you have, Monty?

17:05.248 --> 17:07.750
Even though your suspect
was using a burner phone,

17:07.784 --> 17:10.252
I was able to get a pretty
general picture of his activity.

17:10.287 --> 17:12.788
In the last 72 hours, he had
a pretty steady stream of calls

17:12.823 --> 17:15.089
coming back and forth
between cell towers

17:15.125 --> 17:17.992
about 450 miles from you...
in and around Istanbul.

17:18.028 --> 17:20.829
Istanbul is the primary way
point in the Middle East.

17:20.864 --> 17:22.464
They would have taken Emma there first.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.267
Monty, let the jet know we need
to be wheels-up immediately.

17:25.301 --> 17:28.537
We're on our way.

17:31.174 --> 17:34.877
You say you love Emir,
and yet you betray him?!

17:34.911 --> 17:36.212
What?!

17:36.246 --> 17:38.180
I would... I would never betray him.

17:38.215 --> 17:41.851
Your FBI just barged into
Emir's apartment in Antalya.

17:41.885 --> 17:44.687
They took Emir's friend
Marko into custody!

17:44.721 --> 17:47.690
Do you have any idea what
they will do to that man?

17:47.724 --> 17:48.958
No, I don't understand!

17:48.992 --> 17:54.230
They will torture him until he
tells them where to find Emir!

17:54.264 --> 17:55.865
I wanted to trust you.

17:55.899 --> 17:58.467
I just came here to be with Emir.

17:58.501 --> 18:00.903
Oh, but my parents...

18:00.937 --> 18:03.005
They might have called
the police at home.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.741
Because you called them.

18:14.184 --> 18:16.852
What else are you
lying to us about, Emma?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.520
Please, don't do this.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.755
Please!

18:19.789 --> 18:21.757
Please! Please don't do this.

18:21.791 --> 18:24.193
Please!

18:24.227 --> 18:26.228
We'll be on the ground
in Istanbul in 20.

18:26.263 --> 18:27.763
Talk to me, Monty. What do you got?

18:27.797 --> 18:28.697
Per Dale's request,

18:28.732 --> 18:30.833
Turkish Intelligence
provided local police

18:30.867 --> 18:34.003
with all known associates and
addresses for Marko Bashir.

18:34.037 --> 18:36.538
They're following up now. Nothing yet.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.841
So Bashir's not tied to any
specific terrorist group?

18:38.875 --> 18:40.910
Well, the C.I.A. is
telling me that he will work

18:40.944 --> 18:44.046
for any terrorist organization
that pays on time and in cash.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.949
This doesn't make any sense
when you think about it, Jack.

18:46.983 --> 18:49.685
This whole scheme to
lure Emma to Antalya

18:49.719 --> 18:53.088
seems too elaborate for sex
trafficking, don't you think?

18:53.123 --> 18:56.525
I agree. This Hanim ruse
seems more sophisticated.

18:56.559 --> 18:59.094
Six months of dedication
to bring her over here.

18:59.129 --> 19:01.096
And this recruiter was methodical,

19:01.131 --> 19:03.132
lulling Emma into compliance

19:03.166 --> 19:04.533
by tapping very specifically

19:04.567 --> 19:06.602
into her sensitivities
and vulnerabilities.

19:06.636 --> 19:08.871
Monty, where are we
on tracking the origins

19:08.905 --> 19:11.373
of these communications
between Hanim and Emma?

19:11.408 --> 19:13.075
Okay, we're fighting
firewalls and re-routes.

19:13.109 --> 19:14.576
So I'm gonna go out on a limb here

19:14.611 --> 19:15.611
and say these countermeasures mean

19:15.645 --> 19:17.913
that there is no Hanim Atvan.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.881
Well, Hanim or no Hanim,

19:18.915 --> 19:20.983
the recruiter who sent
those communications

19:21.017 --> 19:23.585
knows where she is.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.487
Boss, I got bad news.

19:25.522 --> 19:27.089
Istanbul police found a body.

19:27.123 --> 19:29.992
It matches Emma Peters'
physical description.

19:32.028 --> 19:34.897
Dale, have the police hold
that crime scene for us.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.932
And as the victim
appears to be American,

19:36.967 --> 19:38.901
I want Mae to perform the autopsy.

19:38.935 --> 19:39.969
Consider it done.

19:40.003 --> 19:42.671
Okay, you two take the
crime scene and the body.

19:42.706 --> 19:45.908
You and I will figure out
who's pretending to be Hanim.

19:54.951 --> 19:58.187
This isn't Emma.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.923
There's no I.D., but
a Hughes College tattoo

20:00.957 --> 20:03.025
and very Western dental work

20:03.059 --> 20:04.827
suggests that she is also an American.

20:04.861 --> 20:07.763
What are the chances that two
nearly identical American girls

20:07.797 --> 20:09.765
get in trouble in
Turkey at the same time?

20:09.799 --> 20:11.834
About the same as being hit by lightning

20:11.868 --> 20:14.003
while being eaten by a shark.

20:14.037 --> 20:17.039
She's got a single gunshot wound
to the posterior cranial cavity.

20:17.073 --> 20:19.274
You know, the way her body's
positioned, it suggests

20:19.309 --> 20:22.044
that she could have been shot
while running down the street.

20:22.078 --> 20:22.978
She was probably running

20:23.013 --> 20:25.514
from the same people
who got Emma Peters.

20:25.548 --> 20:27.216
Okay, I'm gonna go start the autopsy

20:27.250 --> 20:30.986
and have Monty run our Jane
Doe's DNA through codis.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.855
Maybe she'll lead us to Emma.

20:51.674 --> 20:53.675
Are you all right, my dear?

20:55.678 --> 20:58.714
Who are you?

20:58.748 --> 21:00.382
My name is Marion.

21:00.417 --> 21:03.685
Emir is a friend, as is Hanim.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.089
Please... let me go.

21:07.123 --> 21:09.425
You really do love him, don't you?

21:09.459 --> 21:12.394
We value that which is
rare in this world...

21:12.429 --> 21:15.064
gold, diamonds.

21:15.098 --> 21:17.733
But the rarest of all is love.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.735
True love.

21:19.769 --> 21:21.837
Why won't you let me see Emir?

21:21.871 --> 21:24.840
You will see him. I promise.

21:24.874 --> 21:26.943
But what is happening to you
is happening for a reason.

21:26.979 --> 21:29.313
I'm not lying to you...

21:29.348 --> 21:31.282
Or them. I don't know anything.

21:31.316 --> 21:34.485
I came here because I thought
Emir and I could be together.

21:34.519 --> 21:35.953
I lied to my parents.

21:35.988 --> 21:37.621
You made a choice.

21:37.656 --> 21:40.124
That is what growing up
means... making choices,

21:40.158 --> 21:44.929
choosing between childlike
needs and adult desires.

21:44.963 --> 21:47.331
I don't understand.

21:47.366 --> 21:50.101
Right now, you're living
in two separate worlds.

21:50.135 --> 21:52.536
You can't continue to live both lives.

21:52.571 --> 21:54.338
It isn't fair to Emir.

21:54.373 --> 21:57.041
In fact, it's dangerous for him.

21:57.075 --> 21:58.676
Dangerous?

21:58.710 --> 22:01.612
Emir is much more than you think he is.

22:01.646 --> 22:03.814
He's a fighter.

22:03.849 --> 22:07.151
He fought for me, protected me.

22:07.185 --> 22:10.988
And you witnessed firsthand
how he was treated, didn't you?

22:13.525 --> 22:17.461
Emir has never given
up doing what is right.

22:17.496 --> 22:19.663
Will you give up on him?

22:19.698 --> 22:21.665
No.

22:21.700 --> 22:25.503
Never.

22:25.537 --> 22:28.139
Our Jane Doe is
18-year-old Julie Allen,

22:28.173 --> 22:29.407
from Columbus, Ohio.

22:29.441 --> 22:31.008
Why wasn't Julie a missing person?

22:31.043 --> 22:33.744
Technically 'cause she was a
legal adult who just left home.

22:33.779 --> 22:36.414
It looks like Julie ran off for
the same reason that Emma did...

22:36.448 --> 22:37.882
she was lonely, looking for love.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.383
Both were targeted online

22:39.418 --> 22:41.852
based on vulnerability and desirability.

22:41.887 --> 22:44.555
Make sense, but desired for what?

22:44.589 --> 22:46.690
Whatever it is, it's going down soon.

22:46.725 --> 22:48.759
'Cause according to both
sets of communications,

22:48.794 --> 22:51.028
somebody wanted Emma
and Julie to arrive there

22:51.063 --> 22:52.530
no less than 48 hours ago.

22:52.564 --> 22:54.565
These girls are a specific type, Jack.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.667
I think it's safe to
assume this terrorist group

22:56.701 --> 22:57.935
has tried to recruit
others just like them.

22:57.969 --> 23:01.939
Young, innocent. Both could pass
as tourists without suspicion.

23:01.973 --> 23:03.941
As young and naive as
these girls are, surely

23:03.975 --> 23:06.410
they would never willingly
participate in a terrorist plot.

23:06.445 --> 23:08.746
I think we need to leave
the possibility of anything

23:08.780 --> 23:09.847
open right now.

23:13.085 --> 23:15.719
Why hasn't Emir come to see me?

23:15.754 --> 23:17.521
Is he mad at me?

23:17.556 --> 23:19.390
I know this is hard for you.

23:19.424 --> 23:22.526
You believe that love
requires sacrifice, don't you?

23:22.561 --> 23:23.861
Yes.

23:23.895 --> 23:26.964
Sometimes great sacrifice.

23:26.998 --> 23:30.701
You so remind me of myself at your age.

23:30.735 --> 23:32.470
What did you have to sacrifice?

23:32.504 --> 23:35.039
Everything.

23:35.073 --> 23:36.640
But what they say is true, Emma.

23:36.675 --> 23:41.078
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

23:41.113 --> 23:43.080
I want to be strong.

23:43.115 --> 23:45.716
You will be.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.985
And I want there to be
no secrets between us.

23:48.019 --> 23:49.987
You deserve to know the truth.

23:50.021 --> 23:52.123
Emir's parents are much like yours.

23:52.157 --> 23:54.091
They want him to
conform to certain rules.

23:54.126 --> 23:56.227
They want him to remain
in the family home,

23:56.261 --> 23:59.130
to continue with the family
business, as is customary.

23:59.164 --> 24:02.133
And that's why they've
chosen a bride for him.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.767
A br... a bride?

24:03.801 --> 24:07.804
Emir's family is forcing him
to choose who he will love.

24:07.838 --> 24:09.806
Really?

24:09.840 --> 24:12.208
And he chooses you, Emma.

24:17.548 --> 24:20.150
It's time to get you ready
for him, don't you think?

24:22.219 --> 24:23.820
We analyzed the linguistics

24:23.854 --> 24:26.823
used in the e-mails that
lured both girls to Turkey.

24:26.857 --> 24:30.360
Each person's use of language
is surprisingly distinct.

24:30.394 --> 24:33.196
And it's often a very good way
to determine someone's identity.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.665
Let's start with how
language subtly encodes gender

24:35.699 --> 24:37.100
within sentence structure.

24:37.134 --> 24:39.102
Both recruiters repeatedly used pronouns

24:39.136 --> 24:42.605
such as "I, she," and
"myself," which, statistically,

24:42.640 --> 24:45.208
are attributed to
females more than males.

24:45.242 --> 24:47.277
Note the phrase "on the cards."

24:47.311 --> 24:50.313
But isn't that just a typo for
the expression "in the cards"?

24:50.347 --> 24:52.115
No, no, it's a British expression,

24:52.149 --> 24:56.286
and it's used multiple times
in both chains of communication,

24:56.320 --> 24:59.389
just like the use of the British
idiom "wood for the trees."

24:59.423 --> 25:02.058
The use of these turns
of phrase strongly suggest

25:02.092 --> 25:04.160
that the writer of both
lines of communication

25:04.195 --> 25:05.895
is someone of British origin.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.231
So you're sure that Emma
Peters and Julie Allen

25:08.265 --> 25:09.899
were recruited by the same person?

25:09.934 --> 25:12.135
Yes... female, British,

25:12.169 --> 25:14.370
well-educated, most likely in her 40s.

25:14.405 --> 25:16.039
And the recruiter's strategy

25:16.073 --> 25:18.908
of inducing guilt to flip each
girl is strongly indicative

25:18.943 --> 25:20.510
of an advanced interrogation technique.

25:20.544 --> 25:21.444
Well, wouldn't that imply

25:21.478 --> 25:23.379
they have a background
in intelligence work?

25:23.414 --> 25:25.215
Yes, and there can't be that many women

25:25.249 --> 25:27.150
- who fit that description.
- It's kind of hard for me

25:27.184 --> 25:29.185
to wrap my brain around
a female British spy

25:29.220 --> 25:31.054
who is enticing these
young American girls

25:31.088 --> 25:33.356
into the hands of islamic terrorists.

25:33.390 --> 25:36.226
All right. I checked
interagency databases,

25:36.260 --> 25:37.860
and I found five candidates

25:37.895 --> 25:40.430
that fit your age, sex,
and background parameters.

25:40.464 --> 25:42.065
Five. That's a start.

25:42.099 --> 25:44.667
Actually, we may only
need to focus on one.

25:44.702 --> 25:47.203
Here's a full dossier
on Ms. Marion Codwell,

25:47.238 --> 25:49.205
C.E.O. of the Marion Codwell Group,

25:49.240 --> 25:52.275
a consulting firm based
right there in Istanbul.

25:52.309 --> 25:53.509
Now, the icing on the cake

25:53.544 --> 25:58.214
is that she likes to flaunt her
10 years experience with MI6.

26:06.290 --> 26:08.391
Do you think Emir will like this?

26:13.797 --> 26:16.266
What's wrong?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.668
Oh, my dear child.

26:21.905 --> 26:23.940
Emir is dead.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.077
No.

26:28.112 --> 26:29.279
No!

26:29.313 --> 26:33.216
The Americans have murdered him.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.118
Why?!

26:35.152 --> 26:37.287
Why would they kill him?

26:37.321 --> 26:39.122
When Emir was thrown out of the U.S.,

26:39.156 --> 26:41.491
your government labeled
him an enemy of the state.

26:41.525 --> 26:44.127
They put a bounty on his head.

26:48.265 --> 26:50.266
He got kicked out because of me.

26:50.301 --> 26:52.235
He was defending me.

26:52.269 --> 26:53.436
You mustn't blame yourself.

26:53.470 --> 26:57.106
How could you know the FBI
was using you to get to Emir?

27:01.713 --> 27:03.681
This is all my fault.

27:03.714 --> 27:05.148
No.

27:05.182 --> 27:09.252
It's not your fault.

27:09.286 --> 27:11.521
But only you can make it right.

27:19.067 --> 27:22.503
Emma Peters and Julie Allen
were recruited for a purpose.

27:22.537 --> 27:25.172
We need to know what Codwell
and her terrorist friends

27:25.206 --> 27:26.040
have in mind.

27:26.074 --> 27:28.409
Well, according to Codwell's background,

27:28.443 --> 27:31.578
in '04, she was an
interrogator on loan from MI6

27:31.613 --> 27:34.081
at Abu Ghareb when the abuse took place.

27:34.115 --> 27:35.282
She also spent time in '06

27:35.317 --> 27:38.218
working with one of the C.I.A.'s
black sites in the Balkans.

27:38.253 --> 27:40.754
She's been witness to a
lot of death and depravity.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.090
That's a level of trauma
that will desensitize anyone.

27:43.124 --> 27:44.591
Maybe even radicalized her.

27:44.626 --> 27:46.093
Right now, I think our best plan

27:46.127 --> 27:48.095
is for Clara to pay Codwell a visit,

27:48.129 --> 27:50.230
see if she can shake the tree.

27:50.265 --> 27:52.099
Simmons, let's wire Clara up.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.234
Let's go fishing.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.009
Good afternoon.

28:02.043 --> 28:04.211
I'm special agent Clara Seger, FBI.

28:04.245 --> 28:07.214
I need to speak with Ms. Marion Codwell.

28:07.248 --> 28:09.083
Please follow me.

28:15.590 --> 28:19.426
Ms. Codwell, this is
agent Seger from the FBI.

28:23.665 --> 28:25.566
Agent Seger, what can I do for you?

28:25.600 --> 28:26.533
We have reason to believe

28:26.568 --> 28:28.635
that your office's
servers have been hacked

28:28.670 --> 28:33.073
and used to send a series
of illicit communications.

28:33.108 --> 28:34.742
Our server is the envy

28:34.776 --> 28:37.611
of your friends at
Fort Meade in Maryland.

28:37.645 --> 28:39.947
It's literally impossible
for it to have been hacked.

28:39.981 --> 28:41.615
Well, if that's the case, Ms. Codwell,

28:41.649 --> 28:45.085
that means these communications
originated in this building...

28:45.120 --> 28:46.286
In your office.

28:46.321 --> 28:47.921
Indeed.

28:47.956 --> 28:49.556
The truth is that
finding the inspiration

28:49.591 --> 28:51.425
to descend to such a pedestrian level

28:51.459 --> 28:54.128
is often my foremost challenge.

28:54.162 --> 28:56.463
So you admit to luring these girls?

28:56.498 --> 28:59.099
Luring? I wouldn't call
it that, Agent Seger.

28:59.134 --> 29:01.135
I'm a headhunter, a recruiter.

29:01.169 --> 29:03.103
I find people who want to be found,

29:03.138 --> 29:05.839
and I match them with
people who want to find them.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.242
I'm sorry. I'm unfamiliar
with the Turkish law

29:08.276 --> 29:11.345
that forbids, for lack of
a better term, role-playing.

29:11.379 --> 29:14.348
Julie Allen is dead, and
Emma Peters was kidnapped.

29:14.382 --> 29:17.184
Looking for love in
all the wrong places.

29:17.218 --> 29:19.853
Turkey can be such a
treacherous place, I'm afraid.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.256
She's right, Jack. These
communications alone

29:22.290 --> 29:24.491
are not enough to charge
her with a crime here.

29:24.526 --> 29:27.294
And we have no authority
to detain Codwell in Turkey.

29:27.328 --> 29:30.030
I know. But Codwell's
sense of superiority

29:30.065 --> 29:31.432
is her Achilles' heel.

29:31.466 --> 29:34.001
Clara will be able to exploit it.

29:34.035 --> 29:35.035
I find it extraordinary,

29:35.070 --> 29:38.539
your indignation at one
girl's untimely passing.

29:38.573 --> 29:41.041
Like Stalin said, one
death is a tragedy.

29:41.076 --> 29:42.643
One million is a statistic.

29:42.677 --> 29:44.711
Every death is a tragedy.

29:44.746 --> 29:47.481
Unless those deaths are beset
upon the children of Ishmael.

29:47.515 --> 29:48.515
And here I presumed

29:48.550 --> 29:50.884
your loyalties were
traded on the open market.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.020
You deign to question my loyalties,

29:53.054 --> 29:54.855
but you see no irony in your work

29:54.889 --> 29:57.658
supporting the follies
of an empire of lies,

29:57.692 --> 30:00.461
masquerading as the
great arbiter of peace.

30:00.495 --> 30:02.196
That's it.

30:02.230 --> 30:03.997
What's it?

30:04.032 --> 30:05.499
Jack, she's toying with us.

30:05.533 --> 30:07.501
What's up, boss?

30:07.535 --> 30:09.870
Monty, I need you to
look up something for me.

30:09.904 --> 30:12.406
If you Americans had any
real sense of history,

30:12.440 --> 30:15.209
then you would know that
your country's very inception

30:15.243 --> 30:17.978
is founded upon the acts and atrocities

30:18.012 --> 30:20.347
that you so earnestly now condemn.

30:20.381 --> 30:22.216
Let me get this straight.
You are comparing

30:22.250 --> 30:25.486
military battles between the
British and American colonists

30:25.520 --> 30:28.589
to suicide bombings of
churches and mosques?

30:28.623 --> 30:31.558
Much as I have enjoyed
our little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte,

30:31.593 --> 30:33.827
it's clear to me that you
are out of your league,

30:33.862 --> 30:36.096
not to mention your jurisdiction.

30:36.131 --> 30:37.164
We're done.

30:37.198 --> 30:39.299
Not nearly, miss Codwell.

30:42.904 --> 30:43.804
You're right, Jack.

30:43.838 --> 30:45.706
Codwell needs to find
herself a new writer,

30:45.740 --> 30:48.175
'cause she just kept dropping
lines directly from the mouth

30:48.209 --> 30:50.878
of Iraqi terrorist leader
Abu Hakim Al Badi...

30:50.912 --> 30:53.747
specifically from a speech
he gave in Mosul last March.

30:53.781 --> 30:57.251
Al Badi's ideology and beliefs
are second nature to Codwell.

30:57.285 --> 30:59.052
She can't help but pay homage to him.

30:59.087 --> 31:00.587
Which says to me that she and Al Badi

31:00.622 --> 31:03.390
have been working together
for a very long time.

31:03.424 --> 31:05.292
Yeah, but it looks like
this is the first time

31:05.326 --> 31:06.627
they've recruited teenage girls.

31:06.661 --> 31:08.095
Yes, but if they're not trying

31:08.129 --> 31:09.763
to turn them into sex slaves and brides,

31:09.797 --> 31:11.798
then what is their value to Al Badi?

31:11.833 --> 31:12.966
Well, as Americans,

31:13.001 --> 31:16.203
these girls can easily gain
access to Western sites...

31:16.237 --> 31:17.304
American sites.

31:17.338 --> 31:19.706
Jack, you don't really think
they're trying to get Emma

31:19.741 --> 31:21.708
to participate in a
terrorist attack, do you?

31:21.743 --> 31:24.278
I think that's been their
plan from the beginning.

31:24.312 --> 31:28.882
But she would have to go in
on her own volition, alone.

31:28.917 --> 31:31.585
I just don't see how you
transform a lovesick girl

31:31.619 --> 31:34.121
into a suicide bomber in 72 hours.

31:34.155 --> 31:36.490
Well, the truth is we've been
able to flip hardened terrorists

31:36.524 --> 31:38.225
against their buddies in less time.

31:38.259 --> 31:40.394
Honestly, breaking and turning Emma

31:40.428 --> 31:42.429
would be surprisingly simple.

31:42.463 --> 31:44.131
Both Al Badi and Codwell began

31:44.165 --> 31:45.999
by exploiting Emma's love for Emir.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.901
Right, they probably welcomed her

31:47.936 --> 31:50.737
and raised her expectation and
anticipation for their reunion.

31:50.772 --> 31:53.240
But they keep dangling that
carrot just out of reach.

31:53.274 --> 31:55.275
Gradually isolating her emotionally.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.376
Once they have Emma convinced

31:56.411 --> 31:59.313
that she will finally get
the love that she craves...

31:59.347 --> 32:01.081
They tell her Emir's been murdered.

32:01.115 --> 32:04.618
And this insecure girl's world
comes crashing in on itself.

32:04.652 --> 32:07.788
And it's in that moment
that Emma's most susceptible

32:07.822 --> 32:10.958
to the suggestion that she
has something to kill for.

32:24.405 --> 32:26.340
I want to speak with Marion.

32:26.374 --> 32:28.875
Emma...

32:28.910 --> 32:29.876
I can understand

32:29.911 --> 32:33.113
you're confused and
uncertain about who we are

32:33.147 --> 32:35.549
and who Emir was.

32:35.583 --> 32:38.619
But the real reason Emir
avoided contact with you

32:38.653 --> 32:42.456
was because he wanted to protect you.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.625
Protect me?

32:44.659 --> 32:45.993
From what?

32:46.027 --> 32:48.862
Emir had uncovered crimes...

32:48.896 --> 32:51.531
Murders carried out by your government

32:51.566 --> 32:55.168
against those who opposed
them in the region.

32:55.203 --> 32:57.638
I need to show you something.

33:04.445 --> 33:08.048
This was an Islamic school in Ramadi.

33:13.054 --> 33:17.557
That was the venue of a
wedding ceremony in Mosul.

33:17.592 --> 33:23.497
And this was a local
prayer group in Haditha.

33:23.531 --> 33:25.999
Okay, you're saying
that Al Badi and Codwell

33:26.034 --> 33:28.869
can convince Emma to
avenge Emir's murder.

33:28.903 --> 33:30.437
So, then, who will they say killed Emir?

33:30.471 --> 33:32.539
The same man Al Badi holds responsible

33:32.573 --> 33:34.441
for the drone strike last year in Ramadi

33:34.475 --> 33:36.877
that killed his younger
brother, Ahmed...

33:36.911 --> 33:38.412
U.S. ambassador Tom Wilson.

33:38.446 --> 33:40.247
Right, they will say the ambassador

33:40.281 --> 33:42.516
is the one who put the
bounty out on Emir's head.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.084
And don't forget, Ambassador Wilson

33:44.118 --> 33:46.553
is about to secure an alliance
between Iraq and Turkey

33:46.587 --> 33:48.388
against Al Badi and his terrorist group.

33:48.423 --> 33:51.525
The signing ceremony is this
afternoon at the U.S. consulate.

33:51.559 --> 33:53.593
Al Badi's days are numbered
if that deal goes down.

33:53.628 --> 33:56.530
And that's why he's prepared
to sacrifice Emma Peters

33:56.564 --> 33:58.465
to make sure it doesn't happen.

33:58.499 --> 34:02.469
These atrocities were all
committed by your government.

34:02.503 --> 34:07.741
Emir gave his life trying
to avenge these crimes.

34:07.775 --> 34:12.478
And now I can no longer protect you.

34:12.513 --> 34:15.549
I think it would be
best for all of us...

34:15.583 --> 34:18.784
If you returned home.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.154
I have no home.

34:21.188 --> 34:24.458
I chose to leave to be here...

34:24.492 --> 34:26.592
With the one I love.

34:29.496 --> 34:31.331
Please...

34:31.366 --> 34:33.567
Let me help you.

34:36.603 --> 34:38.438
For Emir.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.268
Right now, the ambassador
and his guests will be safer

34:45.303 --> 34:47.137
on consulate grounds than anywhere else.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.339
Absolutely. The diplomatic
security service and the marines

34:49.373 --> 34:50.974
will have everything locked down.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.309
I'll make sure the Turkish forces

34:52.342 --> 34:54.277
reinforce the consulate's
outer perimeter.

34:54.312 --> 34:56.813
But, Jack, if Emma manages to get close,

34:56.848 --> 34:58.682
they'll have no choice
but to shoot to kill.

34:58.716 --> 35:01.184
That's the last thing we want.
We need to try to save her.

35:01.219 --> 35:02.719
What if she doesn't want to be saved?

35:02.754 --> 35:04.855
Once she knows the truth, she will.

35:30.448 --> 35:33.483
You must get inside the courtyard.

35:37.722 --> 35:40.390
You must get close to the ambassador.

35:43.861 --> 35:46.163
Within 10 feet.

35:52.804 --> 35:56.039
Emir awaits you in eternity.

36:13.925 --> 36:15.458
Emma.

36:15.493 --> 36:18.428
My name is Jack with the FBI.

36:18.462 --> 36:19.930
I know why you're here.

36:19.964 --> 36:21.631
I know why you think
you need to do this.

36:21.666 --> 36:23.700
You don't know anything.

36:23.734 --> 36:25.468
Emir is alive, Emma.

36:25.503 --> 36:28.138
They told you he died, didn't they?

36:28.172 --> 36:30.240
Al Badi and Codwell lied to you.

36:30.274 --> 36:32.909
No. You're lying.

36:32.944 --> 36:34.878
Emma, you traveled
all this way for love.

36:34.912 --> 36:37.447
Don't let the hate they
filled you with take hold.

36:37.481 --> 36:39.249
- Get out of my way.
- Stop!

36:39.283 --> 36:41.751
They're not gonna let you
get near the ambassador.

36:41.786 --> 36:43.787
Snipers are standing by.

36:43.821 --> 36:46.957
Take one more step,
and they'll shoot you.

36:46.991 --> 36:50.093
So just drop the switch right now.

36:50.127 --> 36:52.596
We need everyone to clear the courtyard.

36:52.630 --> 36:55.332
There's someone you need to talk to.

36:55.366 --> 36:57.400
Emma, it's me, Emir!

36:57.435 --> 36:59.402
Please, do not do this!

36:59.437 --> 37:01.504
Whatever they told
you, they're all lies!

37:01.539 --> 37:03.306
You're trying to trick me.

37:03.341 --> 37:06.743
No, he's not! I am alive! I love you!

37:06.777 --> 37:07.677
Listen to him.

37:07.712 --> 37:10.447
You both have your
lives to live together.

37:10.481 --> 37:13.917
You just need to let go of that switch.

37:13.951 --> 37:15.418
Emir is dead.

37:16.220 --> 37:18.455
- And we can only be to...
- Emma!

37:21.158 --> 37:23.660
Emir?

37:23.694 --> 37:25.195
Emma!

37:28.332 --> 37:29.933
Don't shoot!

37:35.339 --> 37:38.308
It's all right. It's okay.

37:38.342 --> 37:39.609
Emir.

37:39.644 --> 37:41.244
Emir.

37:43.147 --> 37:45.415
It's all right. Emir.

37:48.185 --> 37:49.786
Hey.

37:52.590 --> 37:54.858
Emma.

38:06.170 --> 38:08.138
Al Badi and Codwell had no doubt

38:08.172 --> 38:10.206
that Emma would carry out the mission

38:10.241 --> 38:12.375
and die in the explosion.

38:12.410 --> 38:15.845
They were so arrogant, they
concealed nothing from her...

38:15.880 --> 38:19.549
their identities, their locations.

38:19.583 --> 38:21.484
They never imagined Emma would be alive

38:21.519 --> 38:24.487
to lead us right back to them,

38:24.522 --> 38:26.923
or that Emma's testimony
would let us arrest them

38:26.958 --> 38:30.827
for terrorist conspiracy
under Turkish law.

38:30.861 --> 38:33.096
And it allowed us to
arrest Marion Codwell

38:33.130 --> 38:36.032
and have her face justice
in the United States

38:36.067 --> 38:37.400
for acts of terrorism

38:37.435 --> 38:40.036
transcending national boundaries.

38:40.071 --> 38:43.873
Emir's heroics earned him a
new visa to study in the U.S.,

38:43.908 --> 38:46.443
where he will reunite with Emma.

38:49.447 --> 38:51.614
Can you imagine running
out on your family

38:51.649 --> 38:52.549
to go halfway around the world,

38:52.583 --> 38:55.385
only to find yourself
right back at home?

38:55.419 --> 38:57.620
Yeah, this isn't gonna be easy.

38:57.655 --> 38:59.589
For any of them.

38:59.623 --> 39:01.524
They need time to heal.

39:01.559 --> 39:03.593
And to regain each other's trust.

39:03.627 --> 39:05.595
They will.

39:05.629 --> 39:10.033
Family is a powerful thing.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.768
Let's go home.
