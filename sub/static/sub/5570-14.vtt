WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.072
Previously on Limitless...
I work for the FBI.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.407
You were placed in the FBI.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.511
There is no one you
call family or friends

00:10.544 --> 00:11.679
who I can't touch.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.548
You belong to Mr. Morra
now, which means

00:14.582 --> 00:16.484
you belong to me.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.419
I've been thinking
about Senator Morra.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.189
The shooting. I was watching
footage of Morra.

00:21.222 --> 00:24.725
Almost like he saw it coming
from over 3,300 yards.

00:24.758 --> 00:25.526
Do you think he's on NZT?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.728
The coat Senator
Morra wore that day,

00:27.761 --> 00:29.597
pretty sure it would test
positive for NZT

00:29.630 --> 00:30.664
if someone thinks to test it.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.134
If Senator Morra waits

00:33.167 --> 00:34.668
just a little bit
between doses,

00:34.702 --> 00:36.237
we could use that clean blood,

00:36.270 --> 00:38.606
put it
on a new, identical coat.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.573
I could swap it out
with the real one,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.442
and they can test it for NZT
all they want.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.812
It's Rebecca Harris,
isn't it, asking the questions?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.748
MIKE:
So,

00:47.781 --> 00:48.682
what'd they
tell you

00:48.716 --> 00:50.251
about the job?

00:50.284 --> 00:52.453
They told me there was a lot
they couldn't tell me.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.522
It's bodyguard
detail.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.656
You need backup.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.192
It's been a lot
for two people.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.861
Plus, I've been in
and out of rehab.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.230
I took a bullet.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.265
That doesn't usually happen.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.567
So, I'd be helping you two
protect

01:06.600 --> 01:09.570
some kind of super-genius?

01:09.603 --> 01:10.638
That's really just sometimes.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.406
The rest of the time, he's...

01:12.440 --> 01:14.842
Brian.
Brian.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.777
(inhales, exhales)

01:16.810 --> 01:20.748
* I used to live in a world
of rock and roll *

01:20.781 --> 01:22.350
MIKE:
We give him the
pill once a day.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.185
It enhances his cognition.

01:24.218 --> 01:28.322
* It was my own fantasy

01:28.356 --> 01:30.158
IKE:
For the 12 hours it lasts,

01:30.191 --> 01:31.759
Brian is capable
of incredible things.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.829
He becomes the best agent in the
most elite division of the FBI.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.898
(laughs)
Zoltar says,

01:37.931 --> 01:40.501
"You're all the murderer!"

01:40.534 --> 01:42.370
Actually, no,
I programmed it to say that.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.206
But sit tight. You're
all under arrest and stuff.
(laughs)

01:45.239 --> 01:48.209
Oh, I'll take that,
Mr. Chief of Staff.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.543
Just as I thought.
This is the folder

01:49.577 --> 01:51.245
they give the president
on his first day in office.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.581
You know, you're supposed
to protect this country

01:53.614 --> 01:54.748
from things
like...

01:54.782 --> 01:56.750
Seriously? Bigfoot?

01:56.784 --> 02:00.354
The poison was in the
frog the whole time.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.756
So,

02:02.790 --> 02:05.593
you ready to
meet the man?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.195
This is Brian Finch.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.230
Spike!

02:09.263 --> 02:10.231
Nice to
meet you.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.233
My name's (bleep).
No,

02:12.266 --> 02:13.567
that's Mike, that's Ike.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.269
You're Spike.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.171
Is there
a problem?

02:17.205 --> 02:19.940
No.
All right, good.
Pleased to meet you.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.475
Is that a
class ring?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.143
Pride of the Boilermakers.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.880
MIKE:
He's basically
a good guy.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.483
But there's only one person
around here he really trusts:

02:29.517 --> 02:32.753
his handler.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.488
And he's big on family, too.

02:34.522 --> 02:38.792
Or he was big on family.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.694
He hasn't been going out there
as much.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.331
His sister is
really cute though.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.200
I've been thinking
about asking her out.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.268
Come on.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.602
Let's head down.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.275
What's up, man?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.810
Oh.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.979
(mimics ratcheting)

02:59.012 --> 03:00.348
Oh!

03:00.381 --> 03:02.350
Hit me!

03:03.484 --> 03:05.453
IKE:
We do our best
to keep tabs

03:05.486 --> 03:07.521
on Finch during off-hours, too.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.423
Lately, he's
been hanging out

03:09.457 --> 03:11.592
at this other agency
called CRAFT.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.695
They make high-tech gadgets.

03:14.728 --> 03:18.999
Future of warfare-type stuff.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.701
I mean,
that sounds amazing, guys.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.802
I'm all in.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.305
Off to see the Wizard?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.441
Mr. Finch, I just want
to tell you,

03:27.475 --> 03:29.443
I will take a bullet
for this job.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.379
I will take a bullet for you.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.383
Hey, is that
a Goatwhore poster?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.818
You know Goatwhore?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.353
Sure.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.621
Blood for the Master's
my favorite.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.755
But I like that album, too.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.990
Favorite Skeletonwitch album.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.758
Forever Abomination. Of course.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.728
Favorite horror movie.
Rosemary's Baby.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.899
Number one all-time
Sabbath record.

03:51.932 --> 03:55.002
It's not possible to answer
that question responsibly.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.003
(shouts)

03:56.036 --> 03:58.939
Spike, welcome aboard.

03:58.972 --> 03:59.940
All right.

03:59.973 --> 04:04.378
("Pomp and Circumstance"
playing)

04:04.412 --> 04:06.814
(music stops)

04:08.048 --> 04:10.484
I wish you worked
a little harder

04:10.518 --> 04:12.019
on the delivery,
Spike.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.021
I'll never let you down again,
sir.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.390
That's okay. Don't be afraid
of what you can achieve.
Take chances.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.726
Yes, sir.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.295
What's on the docket today,
boys?

04:23.564 --> 04:26.867
A bunch of data came in from
a satellite over Pakistan.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.903
Naz wants you to
absorb and analyze.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.043
REBECCA:
If you're gonna
take jump shots,

04:36.076 --> 04:39.313
make jump shots.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.782
What? I'm on NZT.
You don't think I can hit that?

04:41.815 --> 04:44.418
I'm trying
to get your attention.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.320
You know they have me
counting sheep

04:46.354 --> 04:49.423
in a field
outside Islamabad?

04:49.457 --> 04:51.692
That is literally
what you do

04:51.725 --> 04:53.093
to fall asleep. I...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.863
(groans) I need
something interesting to do.
(chuckles)

04:55.896 --> 04:58.532
I'm on hold with the NYPD.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.802
And the blood I tested on
Senator Morra's jacket,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.103
it came back negative for NZT.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.105
Of course.
But there's
this weird thing

05:05.138 --> 05:06.974
with a button on
his suit coat.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.678
The second one up on the left
sleeve, there's a chip in it.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.348
But the chip from the crime
scene photos is different

05:14.382 --> 05:16.450
from the chip I saw
in the evidence locker.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.622
It's a little different.
I mean, that one's bigger.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.890
Looks like it got damaged
or something.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.059
Yeah. Or someone tampered with
evidence by switching the coats.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.770
That doesn't seem likely.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.139
Boyle and I are gonna follow the
chain of custody for the coat,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.542
see if we find anything hinky.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.078
NYPD had it first, then
they passed it to us.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.547
(sighs)

05:46.580 --> 05:48.482
They just hung up on me.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.018
New York's finest.
Unbelievable.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.489
BRIAN:
Not good, buddy.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.826
That is a trail that
leads right back to you.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.160
And the evidence clerk
who was working

06:00.193 --> 06:02.630
the day she picked
up Morra's coat,

06:02.663 --> 06:04.465
he saw your face.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.472
Finch.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.907
Are you throwing away the files
I assigned you?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.576
No.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.077
I'm recycling them.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.111
And memorizing them

06:18.145 --> 06:20.748
so I can digitize everything
later. It's all...

06:20.781 --> 06:24.117
Stop. I just got a call
from Quentin Walker at CRAFT.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.086
He's requesting
your help.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.822
(indistinct police transmission)
(siren wailing in distance)

06:30.458 --> 06:34.495
Eloise Carlisle is one of
the best minds we have at CRAFT.

06:34.528 --> 06:38.499
Was. She was attacked last night
on the way to her car.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.801
Strangled. NYPD believes

06:40.834 --> 06:43.471
that they found her attacker's
DNA under her fingernails,

06:43.504 --> 06:45.473
but it hasn't led them
anywhere yet.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.140
I know they usually
investigate homicides,

06:47.174 --> 06:49.843
but I have
an unusual lead.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.178
Eloise was an innovator.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.714
She made a pair of gloves
fashioned after a gecko,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.183
lets you climb a glass wall
like it was nothing.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.186
She cracked
the vertical takeoff plane.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.455
Invented
the Vayu jet pack.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.824
Somebody murdered the woman
who invented the jet pack?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.827
Of all her work, Eloise was most
proud of Project Mind-Vault.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.497
Are either of you familiar
with the singularity?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.465
It's the idea that,

07:11.499 --> 07:13.467
eventually, we'll be able
to upload a copy of our brains

07:13.501 --> 07:16.770
to a computer. Call it
virtual consciousness, I guess.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.706
But a lot of people think
it's our one real shot

07:18.739 --> 07:22.042
at immortality.
So you die but your mind stays
in a computer?

07:22.075 --> 07:24.044
We're not there yet,
but we're not as far

07:24.077 --> 07:26.079
as people may think.
BRIAN:
Mmm.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.652
Whoa. Quentin,
these are the gecko hands?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.854
'Cause you know
I'm gonna want a pair.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.789
The current thinking
is that it takes two steps

07:35.823 --> 07:37.925
to replicate
the human consciousness.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.660
Step one is you create
a mind-file.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.995
You scan the subject's brain,
you conduct hundreds of hours

07:42.029 --> 07:43.597
of interviews. And from that,

07:43.631 --> 07:45.098
you can create a digital
version of someone that is,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.968
informationally, the same
as they are. We've gotten
pretty good at that.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.971
What's step two?
That mind-file
interacts with software,

07:51.004 --> 07:52.640
which needs to be sophisticated
enough to duplicate

07:52.673 --> 07:55.075
the complexities
of the human mind.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.245
We're making progress.
Eloise made mind-files

07:58.278 --> 07:59.980
for hundreds of people.
The idea is that,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.883
once the software catches up,
we'll be able to have access

08:02.916 --> 08:05.553
to some of the greatest minds
in the world.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.054
Forever.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.922
(trilling)

08:08.956 --> 08:10.791
So you're saying
that you have a bank of geniuses

08:10.824 --> 08:12.826
behind this door?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.897
What is that?

08:16.930 --> 08:21.635
Eloise wasn't just the head
of Project Mind-Vault.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.304
She was a subject.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.874
She maintained
her mind-file constantly.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.642
It knows everything
she knows.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.311
Knew.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.180
So, if you want
to find out who killed

08:33.213 --> 08:35.315
the real Eloise Carlisle,

08:35.348 --> 08:37.184
why not interview the victim
herself?

08:37.217 --> 08:40.654
(trilling, whirring)

08:40.688 --> 08:42.590
Hello.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.658
My name is ELO.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.893
How can I be

08:45.926 --> 08:47.895
of assistance?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.968
*

09:16.323 --> 09:19.026
(whirring)

09:21.294 --> 09:24.197
You think she knows
that the real Eloise,

09:24.231 --> 09:26.667
you know...

09:26.700 --> 09:27.367
Hi, ELO.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.769
My name's Brian.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.239
Hello. It is nice
to meet you, Brian.

09:32.272 --> 09:36.376
I'm not sure if you know
about this or not, but...

09:36.409 --> 09:38.712
Eloise Carlisle,

09:38.746 --> 09:41.248
she died last night.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.251
I am Eloise.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.120
No, but the woman
you used to talk to,

09:47.154 --> 09:48.789
the other Eloise,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.791
she's gone.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.993
I am Eloise.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.996
I am here.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.132
Yes. But...
Eloise and I
are doing

09:59.166 --> 10:01.669
important work together.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.138
Sometimes we like to talk
about gardening.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.274
Maybe we should take
a different approach,

10:07.307 --> 10:08.942
stay away
from the whole dead thing.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.378
ELO,

10:11.411 --> 10:14.147
you saw Eloise
last night.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.149
You were working together,
right?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.318
Was there anyone else here?

10:18.351 --> 10:21.789
Eloise and I are working on...

10:21.822 --> 10:23.423
important
work

10:23.456 --> 10:24.825
together.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.160
This is like talking
to my Aunt Stacey

10:27.194 --> 10:29.262
after her second Diazepam.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.431
I think we might be better off
just going through

10:31.464 --> 10:32.933
Eloise's
project files.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.668
That's probably a good idea.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.940
She was working
on space missiles?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.409
Uh, she was working
on SMDS.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.344
It's a space-based
missile defense system.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.245
REBECCA:
He knows that.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.815
He just likes saying
"space missiles."

10:47.848 --> 10:49.416
Eloise knew
we were behind

10:49.449 --> 10:52.352
a bunch of countries
on space-based defense.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.420
Not friendly countries either.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.155
That's right. She was working

10:55.188 --> 10:56.023
on bridging
the gap.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.225
Well, she was making
a lot of progress.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.894
Less so on the sentient robots.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.230
I'm telling you, we were
just one breakthrough away.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.832
Anyway,

11:04.865 --> 11:08.001
I'm thinking someone
from one of the other countries

11:08.035 --> 11:10.003
didn't like the progress
Eloise was making.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.404
Decided to take out the
person who was bringing

11:11.438 --> 11:12.840
the U.S. up to speed.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.007
How would

11:14.041 --> 11:15.008
they even know that?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.276
Our security's impenetrable.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.444
We use

11:17.477 --> 11:18.812
biometric identity confirmation,

11:18.846 --> 11:22.449
conduct daily scans for spyware
on our computers.
Mm, you conduct

11:22.482 --> 11:25.452
daily scans for spyware
you know how to look for.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.855
You're trying
to find known code anomalies.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.256
So you think
that there's some kind

11:29.289 --> 11:32.893
of invisible super-spyware
lurking on our systems?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.361
It's only invisible till
I figure out what it looks like.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.396
Once he gets like this,
it's usually best

11:36.429 --> 11:38.899
to just let him work
it out of his system.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.267
He'll either make progress or...

11:41.501 --> 11:43.236
...he'll eventually go to sleep.

11:43.270 --> 11:47.040
Actually, I think I'm all out
of steam for today.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.776
Need some coffee?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.944
Ha. Yeah,
that's not gonna cut it.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.113
BRIAN: Project Spyware would
have to wait until my next dose

11:53.146 --> 11:57.217
of NZT, and I had a little
personal business to attend to.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.521
That for me?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.491
Senator's coat.
The real one. With NZT

12:04.524 --> 12:06.827
in the blood.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.965
Everything go smooth?

12:11.999 --> 12:14.334
All good.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.075
This isn't a chat, mate.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.343
It's a debrief.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.012
No one saw me.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.547
I had to talk to one guy
in the Evidence Unit,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.482
but I set it up
so he got trapped in the locker

12:29.516 --> 12:30.951
while I made
the switch.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.020
I took care of the cameras
and the paper trail.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.421
We're all good.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.423
So as far
as the FBI's concerned,

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
the matter's closed?

12:38.391 --> 12:42.095
The NZT tests
came back negative.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.496
Then the
matter's closed?

12:43.530 --> 12:47.400
God! Yes! The matter is closed.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.578
Ouch, dude!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.113
(scoffs)

13:00.147 --> 13:02.315
It's your booster.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.351
You earned it.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.358
You're actually going
in the Natural History Museum?

13:11.391 --> 13:14.494
There's a lecture
on Iroquois farming techniques.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.430
I'd invite you,
but it's sold out.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.339
SPIKE:
We've got wheatgrass,
kale and pear smoothie,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.541
and coconut water.
I wanted to give you

13:28.575 --> 13:30.043
some healthy options.
It's flu season.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.178
This place
will fall apart

13:31.211 --> 13:31.979
if you get sick.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.527
BRIAN:
No, I'm not turning
into a serial hacker.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.330
But those programming skills
I picked up a few weeks ago,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.165
kind of handy
when analyzing spyware.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.302
And while you may enjoy seeing
the lengths my new bodyguard

13:55.335 --> 13:58.305
is willing to go to,
you know and I know

13:58.338 --> 14:00.640
that watching someone mash keys
is boring.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.277
So here's some Vines of the dog
Mishka saying "I love you."

14:04.311 --> 14:07.580
(howling): I love you!
I love you! I love you!

14:07.614 --> 14:09.482
BRIAN:
After I got a handle
on spyware basics

14:09.516 --> 14:11.551
I reverse-engineered what
the spyware should look like

14:11.584 --> 14:13.553
and sent it off to Quentin.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.554
(whistling)

14:14.587 --> 14:16.356
Oh, man, Spike.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.590
Oh, sure.
We'll continue.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.494
All around, I was killing it.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.196
Now that we had the spyware,
Rebecca and Boyle

14:23.230 --> 14:25.632
had enough evidence
to take down the spy himself.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.634
And I can only imagine
how that went.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.669
If we're not inside
in 30 seconds, we'll lose him.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.071
The door's
booby-trapped.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.572
If we don't cut the right wire,

14:32.605 --> 14:33.506
we could lose our lives.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.977
Yeah, well, we're out of time.
Pick one.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.581
REBECCA:
No red wires.
No green wires.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.917
No wires
of any kind.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.119
We served him a warrant,
found his computer and then

14:46.153 --> 14:47.687
took him in quietly.
That's pretty much

14:47.720 --> 14:49.156
how it happens every time.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.623
Does it ever
bother you guys that

14:50.657 --> 14:53.093
your jobs are more interesting
in my head than real life?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.929
His name is
Bill Cumber.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.565
This guy has been feeding China
classified information on

14:58.598 --> 15:00.033
U.S. defense
technology.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.234
Yeah, but we don't
think he killed Eloise.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.537
He was upstate
visiting his sister.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.939
You know, it is hard for me

15:05.973 --> 15:09.076
to get used to the idea
of doing work in this room.
Get used to it--

15:09.109 --> 15:11.945
it's your headquarters, too.
Enjoy.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.680
Cumber told us that Eloise

15:13.713 --> 15:16.549
wasn't as clean
as we thought she was.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.286
Evidently, the spyware
that he planted in her computer

15:19.319 --> 15:21.288
recorded keystrokes.
She was

15:21.321 --> 15:23.690
negotiating a big deal
the night that she died.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.959
What kind of deal?
We couldn't find

15:25.993 --> 15:27.094
the buyer's name,
and I'm not even sure

15:27.127 --> 15:28.561
that she knew the buyer's name.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.397
But whatever
she was selling, she only

15:30.430 --> 15:32.132
referred to it
by number.
Maybe some

15:32.165 --> 15:34.701
type of code?
No. We...

15:34.734 --> 15:36.970
we saw these numbers yesterday.

15:37.004 --> 15:40.407
Now... now, each mind-file
has its own little vault, right?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.977
Uh... there.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.113
B718-Q39502.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.982
That's the first combination
Cumber gave us, right?

15:49.016 --> 15:52.319
It belongs to a Peter Tao.
A top mathematician.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.998
It's empty.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.666
Here, try...

16:07.700 --> 16:10.770
X134-M30556.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.372
Grayson Dumont.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.706
An astrophysicist.
Well, it's empty.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.076
All right...

16:16.109 --> 16:19.746
E877-F67845, A...

16:19.779 --> 16:23.416
uh, A985-M28302,

16:23.450 --> 16:26.386
Empty. P256-T21453,

16:26.419 --> 16:27.654
empty.

16:27.687 --> 16:28.721
Wait.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.723
What?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.360
That's me.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.763
So Eloise was
selling mind-files?

16:46.606 --> 16:49.042
Room service.
(chuckles)

16:49.076 --> 16:50.510
Coffee for you.
Okay.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.179
BRIAN:
Is Spike trying too hard?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.115
Maybe.
I'm not gonna tell him that.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.830
Excuse me.
Thanks.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.166
Yeah.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.268
I needed to focus
on who murdered Eloise Carlisle

17:15.302 --> 17:17.237
and why.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.506
Did someone discover
she was selling mind-files?

17:19.539 --> 17:22.575
Or was it simply
a transaction gone wrong?

17:22.609 --> 17:25.612
Either way, six of the world's
most valuable minds

17:25.645 --> 17:26.813
are missing.
Five of whom

17:26.846 --> 17:29.349
trusted Eloise enough to share
their secrets with her.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.120
Question is were their secrets
worth killing for?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.388
There was Peter Tao,
who works for the NSA.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.590
Grayson Dumont, whose
classified discoveries

17:37.624 --> 17:40.427
range from black holes
to his love for angora.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.729
Catharine Lewis, who's operated
on more than one president

17:42.762 --> 17:44.497
and totally seen them naked.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.100
Winton Miller, who didn't
have any secrets to speak of,

17:47.134 --> 17:49.736
but had affairs
with people who did.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.838
And Quentin, who's been
texting me

17:51.871 --> 17:54.407
(phone whistling)
like he's lost his mind
because, well,

17:54.441 --> 17:56.509
he has.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.679
Most people are terrified of
having their e-mail hacked,

17:59.712 --> 18:02.815
but can you imagine
having your whole brain hacked?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.717
Someone getting access
to your every thought,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.520
your every secret?

18:07.554 --> 18:10.657
That's pretty much
my worst nightmare.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.359
The files could've been
stolen to access

18:12.392 --> 18:14.827
any one of these minds.
I mean...

18:16.496 --> 18:18.865
Wait, but isn't it also possible
someone wanted

18:18.898 --> 18:22.369
all six of them?

18:22.402 --> 18:23.903
That someone

18:23.936 --> 18:26.339
has the software
sophisticated enough

18:26.373 --> 18:28.475
that they could use them

18:28.508 --> 18:32.412
as a hive of geniuses...

18:32.445 --> 18:34.914
capable of God knows what?

18:34.947 --> 18:37.750
That sounds vaguely apocalyptic.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.687
This is cool.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.255
I didn't realize
that riffing back and forth

18:42.289 --> 18:43.590
was gonna be part of the deal.
Where do you even

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
sell something like that?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.162
JAMES:
The Dark Web.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.163
obviously.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.265
The Dark Web.
That always sounds so cheesy.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.867
The Dark Web
is anything but cheesy.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.336
Yeah, but, like,
the more you say it...

18:57.470 --> 19:00.507
Okay. So, did anyone
recently sell the minds

19:00.540 --> 19:03.210
of six geniuses
on the Dark Web?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.912
Uh, is this
for that guy Quentin?

19:05.945 --> 19:09.616
The guy with all the cool
gadgets. The jet pack and the

19:09.649 --> 19:11.184
gecko hands and the...

19:11.218 --> 19:13.220
James. Come on.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.887
You're my tech
guy. Nothing

19:14.921 --> 19:17.156
and no one is going
to change that.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.892
You haven't played Arkham Horror

19:19.926 --> 19:22.695
in a while.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.465
I could come by this weekend.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.800
Fine.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.369
From what I can tell,

19:29.402 --> 19:31.204
Eloise used a middleman.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.874
Mm-hmm.
You're probably looking
for a man who calls himself

19:34.907 --> 19:36.943
TheScrubJay.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.646
That's a... a bird
that hoards things.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.848
Because he collects
and sells rare stuff.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.751
Okay, well,
how will I find this Scrub Jay?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.854
You'd have to have something
he's interested in selling.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.889
Mm.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.391
Kale smoothies...

19:51.424 --> 19:53.293
Spike!
Yes, sir?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.894
How are you on errands?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.230
Are you kidding?
I kill it on errands.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.766
BRIAN:
I sent Spike shopping
while I analyzed TheScrubJay's

19:59.799 --> 20:01.834
hawking habits.
Bird pun not intended.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.970
And while he does dabble
in tech, there is one thing

20:04.003 --> 20:06.506
he can't resist--
rare paintings.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.408
Specifically,
rare stolen paintings.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.909
Found myself
breaking a lot of laws

20:09.942 --> 20:12.011
since working for the FBI,
but here's a new one:

20:12.044 --> 20:13.880
art forgery.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.883
You know, Bob Ross always
made it look so easy.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.420
Happy trees,
happy clouds.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.990
Bob didn't paint psychologically
disturbing naked people.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.558
Well, Winton Miller did.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.960
Since I read his mind-file,

20:27.994 --> 20:30.297
I figured it'd be easy
to concoct a backstory

20:30.330 --> 20:33.300
for this rare,
previously unknown stolen

20:33.333 --> 20:35.935
masterpiece and
use it as bait

20:35.968 --> 20:38.805
to lure
TheScrubJay out.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.307
It's a brilliant plan.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.315
It just...

20:48.348 --> 20:49.816
doesn't seem right.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.819
You mean the...

20:52.852 --> 20:54.654
the genitalia?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.889
It's like the soul is missing.
Probably because Winton

20:56.923 --> 20:59.992
used real nude models.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.028
Like a muse.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.565
Maybe if I had a muse.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.768
I mean...

21:08.801 --> 21:10.437
I guess I could always...

21:13.105 --> 21:14.841
All right.
You're really going there.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.876
(clears throat)

21:19.011 --> 21:21.348
I want that man gone.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.650
What happened?
I have seen things

21:23.683 --> 21:25.785
I can't unsee.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.888
There's no way I am leaving you
with that naked-ass suck-up.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.557
Wait, what?

21:30.590 --> 21:32.725
You-You're leaving?

21:32.759 --> 21:35.728
I thought we were just looking
for a third guy for backup.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.398
Naz said there was a
position opening up at the CJC

21:38.431 --> 21:39.866
and it's mine if I want it.

21:39.899 --> 21:43.002
But I have to have a replacement
lined up, so that...

21:43.035 --> 21:44.571
W-What did you want me to do--

21:44.604 --> 21:46.339
turn down the promotion?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.840
Look, we're gonna
take care of Spike.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.077
I took a bullet
in the line of duty

21:51.110 --> 21:54.947
and you're still
getting out first?

21:54.981 --> 21:56.983
Hey, guys.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.361
Hmm.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.099
These are.. graphic.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.434
Oh, yeah.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.936
So what does nude portraiture

22:16.969 --> 22:19.138
have to do with
hive consciousness?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.640
Well, evidently they both

22:20.673 --> 22:23.476
bring in mo' money,
mo' money, mo' money.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.579
So I had James Tech
put the word out

22:26.613 --> 22:28.080
that I have a stolen
Winton Miller

22:28.114 --> 22:30.116
and I just got an e-mail
from the guy who said he could

22:30.149 --> 22:32.485
sell it for me.
You're in touch ScrubJay?

22:32.519 --> 22:35.154
Or someone claiming to be him.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.523
Supposed to meet
him tonight.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.525
How about you?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.527
How's the whole
chain of custody thing going?

22:40.560 --> 22:43.496
Oh. Um...

22:43.530 --> 22:44.831
We were able
to follow Morra's coat

22:44.864 --> 22:46.499
all the way
from the crime scene

22:46.533 --> 22:48.435
to the evidence control unit.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.869
So no one tampered with it.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.704
Well, I told him that we
couldn't rule out what happened

22:51.738 --> 22:54.507
after it was checked into
evidence. And then I suggested

22:54.541 --> 22:55.975
that we talk to the clerk
who checked it in.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.444
Huh.
Well, do you want me

22:57.477 --> 22:59.078
to try and get someone
over there on the phone?

22:59.111 --> 23:01.080
No, we already went down there.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.418
This is the security footage
from when Boyle and I

23:05.452 --> 23:08.087
checked out the coat.
There's this suspicious

23:08.120 --> 23:10.457
60-second window
where the camera cuts out.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.459
And I talked to the clerk
and he said that

23:12.492 --> 23:14.160
the system had been being buggy,

23:14.193 --> 23:15.762
and that's the reason
that he got locked out.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.430
What'd the clerk say today?

23:17.464 --> 23:18.631
Well, he wasn't on shift.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.533
But it can't
be coincidence, right?

23:20.567 --> 23:21.834
I mean,
even if someone

23:21.868 --> 23:23.836
did knock out the
security camera,

23:23.870 --> 23:25.137
that means they could've been
in the evidence room,

23:25.171 --> 23:26.539
switching the coats

23:26.573 --> 23:28.941
while Boyle and I were
just moments away.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.811
Or while we were there, even.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.846
Spooky, right?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.785
You're nervous, aren't you?

23:40.487 --> 23:42.522
About the painting.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.491
Oh.
You shouldn't be, it's...

23:48.127 --> 23:50.697
...um, striking.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.931
Thanks.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.199
Certainly.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.067
Excuse me.
Oh.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.578
BRIAN: I rolled up
the naked painting of Spike

24:05.612 --> 24:08.515
and put it in a poster tube.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.983
Then I left it at the coat
check for safe keeping

24:11.017 --> 24:13.620
while I met up
with The Scrub Jay.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.589
Rebecca and Boyle hung back
near the exits.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.591
And he told me where to meet
and what color to wear

24:18.625 --> 24:21.160
so I'd stand out.
Or blend in.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.596
I don't know, maybe TheScrubJay
was screwing with me,

24:23.630 --> 24:25.698
but I played along.
I had to.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.233
He was our only lead.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.571
I hear you like
the Naked Pale Man.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.940
I really hope that's how
you start all your negotiations.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.942
(coughs)

24:35.975 --> 24:37.476
I can't wait to see it.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.149
I wanted to ask you
about another sale first.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.817
I got your name
through a friend of mine.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.286
Eloise Carlisle.
(coughs)

24:47.319 --> 24:49.889
I believe you helped her find
a buyer for six rare items?

24:49.922 --> 24:52.058
I don't discuss
past transactions.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.926
(coughs)
If you'll excuse me,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.095
I'm a bit under the weather.
How much
did you know

24:56.128 --> 24:57.129
about the items you sold?

24:57.163 --> 24:59.198
(coughing)

25:06.939 --> 25:08.608
He's not breathing.
I think it was poison.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.610
I'll call an ambulance.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.745
All right...
All right, breathe.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.213
Breathe, breathe.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.648
Come on, come on, come on.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.995
BRIAN: TheScrubJay is dead,

25:29.028 --> 25:30.863
but at least
we got his real name,

25:30.897 --> 25:31.998
because that
led to his records, and that

25:32.031 --> 25:33.933
led to the recovery
of some pretty strange items

25:33.966 --> 25:35.935
he fenced on the black market.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.304
(siren wailing)

25:38.337 --> 25:39.906
(moos)

25:39.939 --> 25:42.709
The good news is the ScrubJay's
records also told us

25:42.742 --> 25:44.644
who bought the mind-files
from Eloise.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.646
A shady think tank with ties

25:46.679 --> 25:47.914
to the highest levels
of government.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.248
GERD.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.851
Global Enterprise
for Research and Development.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.219
They were around
before the acronym

25:53.252 --> 25:55.254
for the heartburn condition.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.589
Sucks for them.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.959
(indistinct conversations)

25:59.992 --> 26:01.594
You know, I always
imagined a think tank

26:01.628 --> 26:03.796
would be more futuristic,
since their job

26:03.830 --> 26:07.066
is, you know,
to think about the future.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.135
It's people like
this who decided

26:09.168 --> 26:10.737
mutually assured destruction

26:10.770 --> 26:13.072
as the best way to
deter nuclear attacks.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.007
Are we sure we want to know

26:15.041 --> 26:17.610
what they might be use
those mind-files for?

26:17.644 --> 26:19.746
Let's just tread carefully.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.714
The president reads what
these guys write when deciding

26:21.748 --> 26:23.716
whether or not we should go
to war, so let's not give them

26:23.750 --> 26:25.384
a reason to go to war
with the CJC.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.585
Oh, I was born
to tread carefully.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.021
I actually considered getting
a tattoo right here on my arm.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.189
I'm glad you thought
better of it.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.725
Names and affiliation?
Rebecca Harris,

26:32.759 --> 26:34.927
FBI.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.099
I don't have you on my list.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.902
I didn't make an appointment.
We're conducting

26:42.935 --> 26:46.005
an investigation and I need
unrestricted access.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.074
GERD REP:
Due to the highly classified
work we do here,

26:48.107 --> 26:49.942
you'll need to go through
the proper channels

26:49.976 --> 26:51.844
for a request like that.
Well, I don't
need classified

26:51.878 --> 26:53.179
material. If I do, I'll
request it officially.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.848
Right now I just need a
list of your employees.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.116
I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.351
What are you guys
planning in Venezuela?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.696
Listen, I want to respect
that highly classified work

27:09.729 --> 27:10.863
you do here,
so why don't you

27:10.897 --> 27:12.164
just take us
to the guy in charge

27:12.198 --> 27:13.666
and we can
discuss this privately?

27:18.070 --> 27:19.906
Born to tread carefully.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.240
(muffled conversations)

27:21.273 --> 27:23.442
MIKE:
All right, what's going on?

27:23.475 --> 27:27.046
You have got to see this.

27:28.414 --> 27:29.982
Why are we FaceTiming Spike?

27:31.417 --> 27:34.854
We're not. He can't see us.
I planted a camera

27:34.887 --> 27:36.088
in the file room.
You what?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.924
My gut told me
that something was off

27:37.957 --> 27:40.359
with the guy, so I took it upon
myself to get the evidence.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.429
And check this out.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.798
You planted two cameras?

27:45.832 --> 27:47.867
I needed another angle.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.802
He's on Brian's computer!

27:49.836 --> 27:51.403
He's reading
his personal e-mails,

27:51.437 --> 27:54.406
looking at his browser history,
online purchases.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.443
This is how Spike has become
such a good kiss-ass.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.045
He's cheating!

27:59.078 --> 28:01.848
What's his agenda?

28:01.881 --> 28:03.449
Hey. I'm John.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.085
That's it, just... John?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.287
I heard you guys have some
sort of crazy story about

28:08.320 --> 28:09.822
stolen minds, is that it?

28:09.856 --> 28:11.123
REBECCA:
We know that GERD bought

28:11.157 --> 28:12.358
the mind-files, John.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.026
If you don't want
to talk to us,

28:14.060 --> 28:15.728
then we can just call
somebody about the adventures

28:15.762 --> 28:16.896
that you're planning
in South America.

28:16.929 --> 28:20.967
Look, there's no need for us
to play a game of chicken.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.436
We have what you're looking for.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.040
So, what? You...

28:28.074 --> 28:29.976
admit to stealing
the mind-files?

28:30.009 --> 28:31.477
We bought them
on the black market

28:31.510 --> 28:33.512
at the behest
of some very important people

28:33.545 --> 28:34.947
in our government.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.448
I have the letters
sanctioning it. Look,

28:36.482 --> 28:39.418
you-you should be happy
that we have them.

28:39.451 --> 28:42.755
Imagine our enemies with
a cabal of our best minds

28:42.789 --> 28:44.423
working around the clock,

28:44.456 --> 28:47.059
figuring out ways
to harm this country.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.995
The letters that you have--

28:49.028 --> 28:51.130
did they authorize you
to murder Eloise Carlisle?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.799
No, in this instance,

28:52.832 --> 28:55.034
"conclusive force" was not
in the brief.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.202
We bought the
files from

28:56.235 --> 28:57.536
Ms. Carlisle's intermediary,

28:57.569 --> 29:00.272
and hired a third party
to supply the hardware.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.241
Frankly, you know, it's...

29:02.274 --> 29:04.811
it's been a bit of a boondoggle.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.079
The tech is no
use to anybody

29:07.113 --> 29:09.315
unless current technology
makes a leap forward

29:09.348 --> 29:11.217
by an order of magnitude.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.785
We'd like to see them.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.955
Be my guest.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.490
There you are.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.229
REBECCA:
There were six mind-files
stolen from CRAFT.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.364
Yeah, you didn't
buy Eloise's?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.433
Miss Carlisle wasn't
part of the package.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.436
We were only
sold the five of

29:30.469 --> 29:32.972
the country's
greatest minds,

29:33.005 --> 29:35.307
just waiting for someone
to make them do something

29:35.341 --> 29:37.109
other than babble at each other.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.046
Quentin said the mind-files were
only as good as their software.

29:40.079 --> 29:43.082
BRIAN:
So if we want answers
about Eloise,

29:43.115 --> 29:45.551
maybe I just have to play around
with her programming.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.553
I make it sound easy,
but this'll take a minute.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.489
The main thing question
of artificial intelligence is,

29:50.522 --> 29:52.925
as Alan Turing put it,
"Can machines think?

29:52.959 --> 29:56.128
Now, I'm not saying
that I answered that question,

29:56.162 --> 29:58.097
but did I make progress?

29:58.130 --> 30:02.168
I think so. I hope so.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.045
Incredible, right?
She looks

30:13.079 --> 30:14.847
the same.
Yeah, but she's not.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.417
Rebecca, meet E-L-O,
two-point-oh.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.420
(whirring)

30:21.453 --> 30:23.489
I improved
her software.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.892
She had all this information
right at her fingertips,

30:25.925 --> 30:28.027
and didn't have
the ability to access it,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.328
to understand her relationship

30:29.361 --> 30:30.562
to the information.

30:30.596 --> 30:31.998
REBECCA:
So, she's more like

30:32.031 --> 30:33.365
Eloise?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.467
Yeah, well, I mean, more
than she was before, anyway.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.138
(keyboard keys clicking)

30:39.171 --> 30:41.974
What would you ask a murder
victim if you had the chance?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.277
Eloise?

30:47.646 --> 30:49.381
Do you know who
murdered you?
To say

30:49.415 --> 30:52.218
who murdered me, I going
to need more information.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.122
Is someone threatening you?

30:56.155 --> 30:58.190
Yes.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.592
Is someone making you afraid
for your physical safety?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.128
Yes.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.530
Who is the person
who's scaring you?

31:04.563 --> 31:06.098
Mauve...

31:06.132 --> 31:08.434
is my favorite color.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.137
Sometimes I dream
about flowers.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.972
Sometimes flowers

31:13.005 --> 31:14.473
dream about me.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.475
Thank you for the insight,
Eloise.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.210
Hey, that evidence
clerk who was working

31:18.244 --> 31:20.612
when the cameras went out is
on duty now. Let's go.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.983
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but you guys
are gonna go right now?

31:24.016 --> 31:25.317
We're making so much progress.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.053
I once dreamed about a timpani,

31:27.086 --> 31:28.554
but I don't think
that a timpani

31:28.587 --> 31:30.222
can dream.
Well...

31:30.256 --> 31:32.291
Gerard.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.262
Gerard?

31:36.295 --> 31:38.965
Who is that? Is that
who's scaring you?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.200
REBECCA:
Brian, you can
keep messing around

31:41.233 --> 31:42.534
with this robot,
or you can come with us.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.073
BRIAN:
If I can't keep them
from talking to that clerk,

31:47.106 --> 31:49.141
there's also no way
this ends well for me.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.143
That's the guy!

31:54.080 --> 31:55.647
That's the guy!

31:55.681 --> 31:57.583
No! Wait! I can explain.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.419
I was working for Senator Morra
the whole time. Ow!

32:00.452 --> 32:03.189
That's the guy!

32:05.557 --> 32:08.594
(high-pitched silenced gunshots)

32:08.627 --> 32:11.230
(gasps)

32:11.263 --> 32:15.101
Come on, mate. You can stay
with me from now on.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.270
BRIAN:
I can't let them leave
without me.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.371
All right.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.172
REBECCA:
Brian!

32:20.206 --> 32:23.375
You coming?
Yeah.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.550
BRIAN:
This is it.
I'm a dead man walking.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.352
Dead man
riding-in-the-backseat?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.087
No, it doesn't carry
the same weight.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.223
But once we get
to the Evidence Control Unit,

32:37.256 --> 32:38.690
that is exactly what I'll be.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.692
My future's never been
so clear.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.095
And the only way
to derail this investigation

32:43.129 --> 32:45.264
is with another investigation.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.499
I need a breakthrough
in Eloise's case

32:47.533 --> 32:49.601
to save me
from full-blown Hindenberg.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.138
(people screaming)

32:52.171 --> 32:54.773
Problem is,
I may have programmed Elo

32:54.806 --> 32:57.543
to be clinically insane.
The only thing she said

32:57.576 --> 33:00.612
that made any sense
was the name "Gerard."

33:00.646 --> 33:02.214
It was a real Hail Mary,

33:02.248 --> 33:06.152
but at least that name
isn't that common.

33:06.185 --> 33:11.657
20 minutes and 347 Gerards
later, I found him.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.161
(whoosh)

33:15.194 --> 33:17.196
(phone chimes)

33:21.300 --> 33:23.469
Hey, team?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.671
Listen, I hate to derail us,
but, uh...

33:25.704 --> 33:28.140
We'll eat later, Finch.
The fact of the matter is,

33:28.174 --> 33:29.675
I could always go
for a good slice,

33:29.708 --> 33:31.643
but this is about Eloise.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.679
I think I know
the guy that killed her.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.189
(door squeaks open and shut)

33:43.222 --> 33:44.723
BRIAN:
I'm guessing
you have some questions.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.592
Let's answer them.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.061
Eloise and Gerard had
an on-again off-again affair,

33:49.095 --> 33:50.696
and since they were both
employed by CRAFT,

33:50.729 --> 33:51.863
they kept it secret.

33:51.897 --> 33:55.367
Eloise tried to move on,
but Gerard became obsessed.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.369
Didn't help that the guy
was mentally unstable.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.271
Come on.
I said stop.

33:59.305 --> 34:02.708
(Gerard groans,
Eloise gasps for air, groans)

34:02.741 --> 34:04.810
BRIAN:
When he realized the love
of his life was gone forever,

34:04.843 --> 34:07.379
he figured the next best thing
is her mind-file.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.848
He stole it,
along with five others,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.784
and it made it look like
it was Eloise who sold them

34:12.818 --> 34:14.553
to TheScrubJay.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.755
When Gerard learned
the FBI was closing in,

34:16.788 --> 34:19.191
he hastily covered his tracks.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.660
In his kitchen,
the FBI found traces of poison

34:21.693 --> 34:23.762
he used to kill TheScrubJay.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.664
And in his basement?

34:25.697 --> 34:29.668
An older prototype of ELO that
he stole to be his very own.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.403
Not creepy at all.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.738
REBECCA:
Mr. Turmann, you could be

34:32.771 --> 34:35.374
looking at two life sentences.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.743
But since the U.S. Attorney
is more lenient

34:37.776 --> 34:39.778
with suspects who confess...

34:39.811 --> 34:41.813
I have nothing to confess.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.849
I am on the Board of Advisors

34:43.882 --> 34:46.652
at CRAFT, so, yes,
there is a possibility

34:46.685 --> 34:49.721
that my DNA would be found
on or near Eloise.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.291
But all
of your so-called evidence

34:52.324 --> 34:53.692
seems to be purely
circumstantial.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.462
Would you really classify
an Eloise doll

34:56.495 --> 34:58.197
in your basement
as circumstantial?

34:59.865 --> 35:01.467
Look, to each his own.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.534
I get it.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.803
But I also get what it's like
to make a mistake,

35:04.836 --> 35:06.538
and to get so

35:06.572 --> 35:08.640
caught up in trying
to cover it up that,

35:08.674 --> 35:09.808
man, you can't even remember

35:09.841 --> 35:11.543
how it started in
the first place.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.380
But for you,

35:14.413 --> 35:16.748
this all started
because of your love for Eloise.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.152
What would you say
if I told you

35:20.186 --> 35:22.421
that in the process
of finding you,

35:22.454 --> 35:24.690
I significantly upgraded

35:24.723 --> 35:26.858
Eloise's software?
GERARD:
What do you mean by

35:26.892 --> 35:29.361
"significantly?"

35:29.395 --> 35:31.397
BRIAN:
So we struck a deal
with Gerard Turmann.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.499
He'd confess to Eloise's murder

35:33.532 --> 35:34.766
if we gave him five minutes

35:34.800 --> 35:37.869
with the new
and improved Eloise.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.840
GERARD:
Anything I can do
to change that...

35:41.873 --> 35:43.209
QUENTIN:
That is a special
kind of crazy.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.211
REBECCA:
I feel like
it's the kind of thing

35:45.244 --> 35:46.478
that could happen to anyone.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.748
You're lonely, there's
an unrequited crush.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.783
The next thing
you know...

35:55.887 --> 35:59.425
Do you want to
get a drink?

35:59.458 --> 36:02.628
Definitely.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.963
There's nothing wrong with an
agent showing some initiative.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.365
In Spike's case, there is.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.933
All right, what have you got?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.941
Oh, it's beautiful.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.809
Oh, thanks, man. The shadows
were a little tricky.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.645
Gentleman, please.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.914
Keep the Finchesque
theatrics to a minimum, yeah?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.818
Thank you.

36:26.852 --> 36:27.753
Well, we wanted
to find out why

36:27.786 --> 36:30.389
Spike was so motivated
to impress Finch.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.690
IKE:
So we decided to tail him.

36:31.723 --> 36:32.958
MIKE:
And after a few dead ends,

36:32.991 --> 36:35.927
we noticed every morning he was
going for coffee at CafГ© Maceo,

36:35.961 --> 36:39.465
which is 40 blocks in the
opposite direction of his home.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.832
IKE:
I mean, sure,

36:40.866 --> 36:42.368
they have a pumpkin spice latte
that will

36:42.401 --> 36:43.469
make you see God...

36:43.502 --> 36:45.404
But right next
door is a mailbox

36:45.437 --> 36:46.738
and packaging store.
And we asked the owner,

36:46.772 --> 36:48.807
and he said Spike
drops off an envelope

36:48.840 --> 36:51.777
every day
to the same address in D.C.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.745
ADIC Johnson's home.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.381
You think

36:55.414 --> 37:00.819
Agent Spike is a, uh,
mole reporting to Johnson?

37:00.852 --> 37:04.290
We figured Johnson wants
to avoid digital communication

37:04.323 --> 37:06.425
after the fiasco
with his phone hack.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.893
The micro-penis incident.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.928
I remember. Thank you very much.
Please.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.599
(phone beeps)
Could you send in
Agent Spike?

37:13.632 --> 37:14.966
By the way,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.668
as it turns out,
that position

37:16.702 --> 37:17.803
with the CJC won't be available

37:17.836 --> 37:19.971
as soon as I thought, but

37:20.005 --> 37:22.574
I think we can transfer you
to Organized Crime to get you

37:22.608 --> 37:23.809
back out in the field.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.844
Actually, I'd prefer

37:25.877 --> 37:28.280
to stay on Finch detail
until then.

37:28.314 --> 37:28.880
Great.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.916
(knocking)
Yeah.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.884
You wanted to see me?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.353
Mm.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.929
(laughs)

37:43.962 --> 37:45.531
Rad.

37:46.698 --> 37:50.035
Oh, Spike, you got

37:50.068 --> 37:51.870
to give my regards
to ADIC Johnson.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.772
When did you find out?

37:53.805 --> 37:56.041
How didn't I find out, man?
It was pretty obvious.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.677
The all-too perfect knowledge
of my favorite bands,

37:58.710 --> 37:59.845
the over-the-top ass-kissing.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.681
It all had the stamp
of one man.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.383
I thought
about saying something.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.051
But, you know, when you got
a good thing going.

38:06.084 --> 38:09.855
Well, I trust
you'll destroy that painting?

38:09.888 --> 38:12.358
The... Oh, yeah, man. Of course.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.362
Oh, and Spike?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.067
Hey.
Hey.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.802
Where's Rebecca?

38:23.835 --> 38:25.937
I think she said
she was going out with Quentin

38:25.971 --> 38:28.607
after she stopped
by the Evidence Control Unit.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.908
Wait. What?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.977
Yeah, she said she wanted
to talk to the clerk

38:32.010 --> 38:33.645
who was there
when we checked out the coat.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.047
Said she couldn't relax
until she took care of that?

38:36.081 --> 38:37.783
You good?

38:37.816 --> 38:40.018
Yeah.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.854
I've always been terrible
about facing the music,

38:42.888 --> 38:45.557
so, I dealt with it
in the only way I know how.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.932
By now, Rebecca's already
spoken to the evidence clerk,

38:53.965 --> 38:55.701
and he's probably
given her a description

38:55.734 --> 38:57.969
matching yours truly.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.106
I wonder if she'll give me
a chance to explain myself,

39:01.139 --> 39:04.410
or if she'll at least keep my
family safe once I'm in jail.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.044
In any case,
I'm out of scenarios.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.746
(knocking)

39:07.779 --> 39:09.781
It's time to come clean.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.663
He's dead, Brian.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.033
The evidence
control clerk.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.002
What?

39:31.036 --> 39:33.104
He had a peanut allergy.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.106
He went to a Chinese restaurant,

39:35.140 --> 39:37.008
where the chef knows
about his allergy,

39:37.042 --> 39:38.143
and makes him special dishes.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.779
But today, somehow,

39:40.812 --> 39:44.015
peanut oil ended
up in his entrГ©e.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.485
He died in the ambulance.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.620
Treating it like an accident.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.989
Yeah.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.024
What else could it be?

39:55.026 --> 39:58.096
I think someone didn't want us
talking to him.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.434
Do you think someone killed him?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.605
Who, though?

40:08.674 --> 40:10.175
The matter's closed.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.033
Yes, I posed for the artist,

40:35.066 --> 40:38.136
and, no, it's not to scale.
