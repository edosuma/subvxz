WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:06.223
- What's this meeting about?

00:06.267 --> 00:07.659
Did someone find
my meatball sub?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.139
- A, we would never have
a meeting about that.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.575
B, you are holding it.
- Oh.

00:10.619 --> 00:11.794
Meeting adjourned.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.317
- Meeting's not over, dummy.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.623
Terry said he had some news
from the office

00:14.666 --> 00:16.103
of Commissioner Wuntch.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.843
What does that human blister
want now?

00:17.887 --> 00:19.976
Does she intend
to demote me even further?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.326
Or perhaps she'll transfer me
to the swamps of New Jersey

00:22.370 --> 00:24.807
so I can patrol the sinkhole
where she was spawned.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.635
- Or it's possible
the announcement has nothing

00:26.678 --> 00:28.071
to do with you.
- Oh, good thinking, Peralta.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.203
You're right.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.378
Maybe Madeline wants to inform

00:30.421 --> 00:31.466
us all that she's a Cheuksin.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.163
- A what?
- A Cheuksin.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.078
A Korean toilet ghost,
lives in an outhouse,

00:35.122 --> 00:37.733
wraps her hair around your
throat and chokes you to death

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
while you move your bowels.
- You know what?

00:39.387 --> 00:41.824
I will give you $6,000
if the announcement

00:41.867 --> 00:43.086
is she's a Cheuksin.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.523
- Okay, everyone.
I have some news.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.917
- That Madeline Wuntch
is a Korean toilet ghost?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.962
Boring.
We already knew that.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.921
- Madeline Wuntch is dead.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.053
- Say what now?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.379
- Wait, Wuntch is dead?
- Yeah.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.294
The Commissioner's office
just notified us.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.556
- No way that's true.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.471
As Wuntch says
when she sees deodorant,

01:20.515 --> 01:22.125
"I'm not buying it."

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
- Sir, she's dead.
- Oh, Terry.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.912
Zombies can't die.
This is some sort of scam.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.436
If she were dead,

01:28.479 --> 01:29.915
we would be hearing
the sounds of children

01:29.959 --> 01:31.395
singing in the streets.
- I don't know, sir.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.049
You didn't believe it
when we told you

01:33.093 --> 01:34.572
the Disco Strangler died,
either.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.878
- And I was right.
He was faking it.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.053
- Maybe she's alive.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.402
- Why would Wuntch fake
her own death?

01:38.446 --> 01:40.317
- The same reason she visits
Mexico once a year

01:40.361 --> 01:41.927
and sucks the blood
from all the goats.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.277
For kicks.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.539
- Look, I don't know
what to tell you,

01:44.582 --> 01:46.280
but she's dead.
What do you want?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.369
To open up her coffin
and check for yourself?

01:48.412 --> 01:50.806
- Oh, she's very dead.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.373
- Hello, gentlemen.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.288
Guess who's walking
the red carpet this Saturday?

01:54.331 --> 01:56.290
- Chord Overstreet.
- Who?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.943
- Sam Evans from "Glee."
- No, me.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.120
Why would you guess that? I was
clearly talking about me.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.425
- Okay, but for the record,

02:01.469 --> 02:02.687
I bet Chord Overstreet
will also be walking one.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.211
- Stop talking about
Chord Overstreet.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.342
No, I'm going
to the world premiere

02:05.386 --> 02:07.823
of "Kwazy Kupcakes: The Movie."

02:07.866 --> 02:09.564
- Whoa!
How'd you get the invite?

02:09.607 --> 02:11.261
- My buddy Mikey J.
hooked me up.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.610
- Oh, your ska friend?
Did he work on the movie?

02:12.654 --> 02:14.438
- No, he submitted
an unsolicited script

02:14.482 --> 02:16.136
that a producer
accidentally opened

02:16.179 --> 02:18.138
so legally they had to give him
a "story by" credit,

02:18.181 --> 02:19.922
and now I've got four tickets.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.924
- Wow.
So who you bringing?

02:21.967 --> 02:24.883
- You know, Cagney and Lacey
love "Kwazy Kupcakes."

02:24.927 --> 02:27.277
They are crazy Kwazy fans.
- Huh, cool.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.800
Well, if you guys
are free this Saturday--

02:28.844 --> 02:30.541
- Stop, before you say
anything you regret,

02:30.585 --> 02:32.456
you should know that
"Kwazy Kupcakes"

02:32.500 --> 02:34.066
means a lot to Nikolaj.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.547
At the orphanage that game
was his only friend.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.027
- Touching,
but Cagney and Lacey

02:38.070 --> 02:39.333
don't have any friends at all.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.943
Maybe they can make some
at this event.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.074
- So what do you say, Jake?

02:42.118 --> 02:43.467
Whose kids do you like more?
- What?

02:43.511 --> 02:44.816
Wait, wait, wait.
That's not what this is about.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.905
- No, Boyle's right.
Whose kids do you like more?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.211
Tell us now.
- Okay.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.604
You guys are being
really intense.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.258
I like all of your kids
an equal amount.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.868
Just give me some space
and I'll figure out

02:52.911 --> 02:54.652
who I'm gonna take.
- Okay, backing off.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.176
- Stepping away.
- Making room.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.742
- Letting you breathe.
- Thank you.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.618
Did you both just send me
pictures of your kids crying?

03:03.661 --> 03:04.836
both: No.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.883
- Ding, dong,
the Wuntch is dead.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.015
Bagels for everyone!

03:10.059 --> 03:11.495
- So I guess
you believe it now.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.888
- Yep.
Wanna see the selfies I took?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.368
- Actually, yes.
- I'll share the album with you.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.412
- Oh, my God!

03:15.456 --> 03:16.935
I just heard about Wuntch!

03:16.979 --> 03:18.328
She was so young!

03:18.372 --> 03:19.851
- For a redwood tree.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.505
Uh, I don't understand
what's going on.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.507
Why are you crying?
- A person is dead.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.901
I feel sad.
- That's insane.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.511
You don't feel sad
when a monster dies

03:27.555 --> 03:28.686
in a monster movie.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.861
In "E.T.,"

03:29.905 --> 03:31.646
do you feel sad
when E.T. dies?

03:31.689 --> 03:33.169
- Yes.
- He wasn't a monster.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.476
- He caused a real commotion.
- It isn't just Wuntch.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.217
I started seeing
a fertility doctor

03:37.260 --> 03:39.828
and she has me taking hormones
to help with ovulation

03:39.871 --> 03:42.352
and my emotions
are in overdrive.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.702
- Well, I know just the thing
to cheer you up.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.444
Wuntch is dead!
Bagel!

03:47.488 --> 03:49.533
Bagel!
Bagel!

03:49.577 --> 03:51.709
- Sir, I am loving
this color on you,

03:51.753 --> 03:53.233
but don't you think
you should tone it down?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.712
- Why, in case I run
into her family?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.018
I'm not planning any trips
to the Bronx Zoo.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.541
- Wait.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.760
Does this mean you're gonna
be captain again?

03:58.803 --> 03:59.717
- It does.

03:59.761 --> 04:00.892
The Chief of Personnel called

04:00.936 --> 04:02.633
to say the promotion
is in the works.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.374
Her death means I've won.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.941
It's finally over.

04:08.639 --> 04:11.642
An email from Madeline Wuntch?

04:11.686 --> 04:14.993
Subject line,
"It's not over."

04:15.037 --> 04:16.473
- My friends,

04:16.517 --> 04:18.910
I have a proclamation
to bestow upon ye.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.303
- Why are you talking
like that?

04:20.347 --> 04:21.565
- And why'd you have us
come in here?

04:21.609 --> 04:22.871
Is this about the tickets?

04:22.914 --> 04:24.786
- It is indeed about
said tickets,

04:24.829 --> 04:27.136
and said proclamation about
said tickets is in fact--

04:27.179 --> 04:29.399
- Jake, just tell us.
No one is liking this.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.053
- I'm loving it.
You sound so smart.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.882
- Oh, thank you,
my loyal subject Charles.

04:33.925 --> 04:37.755
Now, as you know, this decision
has been quite hard upon me--

04:37.799 --> 04:41.455
title of mine sex tape--but
I have made it at long last,

04:41.498 --> 04:45.502
and it is my decree
that the recipient shall be...

04:46.460 --> 04:47.678
Both of you.
- What?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.071
Did you talk to Mikey J.
and get more tickets?

04:49.114 --> 04:50.159
- Indeed I did not,

04:50.202 --> 04:51.203
but it is my decision

04:51.247 --> 04:52.422
that I will cut all

04:52.466 --> 04:54.816
of said tickets in twain.
- Twain?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.253
Terry doesn't want a twained
ticket to "Kwazy Kupcakes."

04:57.297 --> 04:58.820
- That's not how tickets work.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.125
- You'd just be ruining them.
- None of us would get in.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.605
- Are you dumb?
- No!

05:01.649 --> 05:02.824
All right,
full disclosure.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.521
I was trying to do
that Bible thing

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
and then one of you
was gonna take the high road

05:06.088 --> 05:07.394
and say that rather than see
the tickets destroyed,

05:07.437 --> 05:08.351
you would just bow out,

05:08.395 --> 05:09.439
and then that person

05:09.483 --> 05:10.353
was gonna get the tickets.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.746
- Nope.

05:11.789 --> 05:12.703
If I don't get them,
no one does.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.270
- Agreed.
Boyles or bust.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.141
Cut them up.
- I'm not gonna do that.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.839
I'm just gonna have to think of
another way to figure this out.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.320
Stupid Bible with stupid
lessons never solved crap!

05:20.363 --> 05:21.930
- So you were right.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.714
Wuntch was not able to claw
through her coffin

05:23.758 --> 05:25.455
and write the email herself.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.239
It turns out, the lawyer
for her estate sent it.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.067
- I wish I had taken the LSATs.

05:29.111 --> 05:32.506
Not to be a lawyer.
just seems like a fun test.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.898
- Dude, you're bumming us out.
- All right.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.466
Uh, the email contains
a link to a video.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.163
I'm going to play it.
Brace yourselves.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.382
If it shows Madeline,

05:39.426 --> 05:41.079
be sure not to look directly
into her eyes.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.429
- Because we'll turn to stone?
- No.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.213
Because her eyes are ugly.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.563
- Hello, Raymond.
Surprised to see me?

05:46.607 --> 05:48.696
- Well, I didn't say
Bloody Mary three times,

05:48.739 --> 05:50.698
so yes.
- When did she record this?

05:50.741 --> 05:52.264
- Judging by the flames
around her,

05:52.308 --> 05:53.265
it could be a livestream.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.398
Very good, Rosa.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.792
- I'm sure you consider
my untimely death a victory,

05:57.835 --> 05:59.533
but I'd never let you win.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.491
I told everyone that
in my final days,

06:01.535 --> 06:05.277
we reconciled and you insisted
on hosting and organizing

06:05.321 --> 06:07.279
my NYPD memorial service.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.891
I know you won't be able
to resist badmouthing me

06:09.934 --> 06:11.022
at the service.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.241
All the top brass
will be there,

06:12.284 --> 06:13.285
and when you speak ill of me,

06:13.329 --> 06:14.678
it will end your career.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.028
It's over.
I won.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.290
Bye, Raymond.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.292
- Oh, no.
I'm doomed.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.859
- Seriously?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.426
All you have to do
is not insult a dead woman

06:23.470 --> 06:26.037
at her own memorial service.
- Exactly.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.430
It's impossible.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.435
- Oh, you must
be feeling better.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.393
You're heating up
your favorite meal; beans.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.481
- They're refried.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.438
It's bad enough
they were cooked once,

06:35.482 --> 06:36.700
let alone twice,

06:36.744 --> 06:38.354
and now the toaster oven
makes it three times.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.356
I couldn't be crying
for help any louder.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.010
- So I take it
you couldn't get out

06:42.053 --> 06:43.577
of organizing
Wuntch's memorial.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.969
- Oh, no.
It's impossible.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.536
She has bested me yet again.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.191
- Well then stop being such
a moron, you idiot.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.323
- Amy!
- Sorry, it's the hormones.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.673
They're making me
really irritable.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.978
- Angry Amy's right.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.458
All you have to do is say
a few nice comments

06:55.502 --> 06:57.199
during the memorial.
- As God said

06:57.242 --> 06:58.983
when Wuntch tried to sneak past
the gates into heaven,

06:59.027 --> 07:01.464
"It ain't happening, honey."

07:01.508 --> 07:04.162
- I tried to write a kind speech
about her last night,

07:04.206 --> 07:06.295
and this is what came out.
- Oh.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.210
It's, like, 20 pages long.

07:08.253 --> 07:11.082
- Why is it in all caps?
- So I remember to yell it.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.520
- Oh, well, you obviously
can't read any of this.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.131
- Look, since you
can't say anything nice,

07:16.174 --> 07:18.829
try saying the opposite
of whatever you're thinking.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.178
- Interesting.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.397
I'll give it a whirl.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.141
Madeline Wuntch was...

07:27.098 --> 07:28.360
A friend.
- See?

07:28.404 --> 07:29.536
It's not that hard
to say something ni--

07:29.579 --> 07:31.451
oh, you're vomiting.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.931
- Hi, Jake.
It's me, Nikolaj.

07:33.975 --> 07:34.845
- Hey, bud.
What are you doing here?

07:34.889 --> 07:36.107
It's Thursday.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.152
Shouldn't you be
at tailoring class?

07:37.195 --> 07:38.588
- I want to say thank you.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.068
Dad said that you were
giving us tickets

07:40.111 --> 07:41.896
to the "Kwazy Kupcakes" movie.

07:41.939 --> 07:45.421
- Oh, he did, did he?
Excuse me one second.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.250
Of all the twisted moves!
- Don't hate the player.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.773
Go ahead.
Tell Niko he's not going.

07:49.817 --> 07:50.861
I dare you.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.080
Hey, listen.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.822
Niko, there's something
I gotta tell you.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.432
both: Uncle Jake!
Uncle Jake!

07:56.476 --> 07:59.043
- Slow down, girls.
No need to run.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.089
Uncle Jake is family.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.526
Now, what do you wanna say
to Uncle Jake?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.876
both: Thank you
for the tickets.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.617
- Oh, that's so cute
how you said that

08:07.661 --> 08:09.924
at the same time without
rehearsing it in the car.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.752
- It sure is.
Hey, Terry, Charles,

08:11.795 --> 08:13.405
can I speak with you
in the break room for a moment?

08:13.449 --> 08:16.060
Uh, hey, kids,
look at this.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.105
Pimping out your kids?

08:17.148 --> 08:18.541
I hate to say this,
but you two

08:18.585 --> 08:20.587
are acting like bad dads,
and I should know.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.327
One time my father forgot
to pick me up from school

08:22.371 --> 08:24.112
'cause he was having sex
with my best friend's mom.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.200
- Oh, my God.
That's terrible.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.331
- Yeah.
I was 15.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.811
I just walked to the mall

08:27.855 --> 08:29.204
and watched "Empire Records"
by myself,

08:29.247 --> 08:30.988
but the point is,
you're both acting ridiculous.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.686
- No, this is on you, Jake.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.731
You need to make a choice.
- That's not fair.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.865
You both want to go and I don't
want to hurt either of you.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.344
But maybe I don't have to.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.043
I can let fate hurt you.
We'll flip a coin.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.698
Terry, call it in the air.
Heads or tails.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.613
Neither.

08:46.656 --> 08:47.918
- Oh, my God.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.572
Did you just fold my quarter
in half?

08:49.616 --> 08:50.921
- Fate's a bitch.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.836
You make the choice.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.317
- Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.146
Just so you know,
I would never bend your money.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.539
- Yeah, 'cause you can't.
- Correct, I cannot.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.671
- No one can.
How did he do that?

09:01.715 --> 09:04.456
- Now these fertility drugs
are making me sweat.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.632
Is it noticeable?
- No.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.937
- Yes.
- Oh.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.199
I thought we were gonna
lie to her

09:08.243 --> 09:09.636
because it's so upsetting
to look at.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.333
- Just tell me what room
the memorial is in.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.813
We don't have a lot
of time to set up.

09:12.856 --> 09:13.944
- About that.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.032
Yesterday before
you convinced me

09:15.076 --> 09:16.817
to hold a respectful service,

09:16.860 --> 09:20.211
I sent some instructions for
how I wanted the room to look.

09:20.255 --> 09:23.084
We may need to make
some tweaks.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.003
- So many balloon arches.
- I know.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.309
It all has to go.
Okay!

09:31.353 --> 09:33.616
Everyone, we have work to do.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.184
Better?
- Much.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.272
- But to be clear,

09:37.315 --> 09:38.534
the first version was dope

09:38.578 --> 09:39.796
and you have my respect
for life.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.015
- Excuse me.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.626
Is this the memorial
for Madeline Wuntch?

09:43.670 --> 09:47.195
- Yes, this is the memorial
for Madeline Wuntch.

09:47.238 --> 09:50.764
Just saying her name
brings tears to my eyes.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.157
- Why, because her heart
was made of onions?

09:53.201 --> 09:54.245
- Excuse me?

09:54.289 --> 09:55.551
- Madeline Wuntch
was what you get

09:55.595 --> 09:57.684
when you cross a slug
with an anal fissure.

09:57.727 --> 10:01.165
We spent our entire lives
trying to destroy each other.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.777
I was her one true nemesis.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.347
- No.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.348
- Hey there, Jake.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.915
I felt bad about folding

10:11.959 --> 10:12.916
your quarter in half,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.397
so I got you a new one.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.269
- Thank you.
But that's not a quarter.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.401
- Wow, you're right.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.359
That happens to be an 1883

10:21.403 --> 10:23.535
Carson City silver dollar
in near-mint condition

10:23.579 --> 10:24.885
complete with
commemorative case.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.715
That's gotta be worth $138.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.759
You know what?
Keep it.

10:29.803 --> 10:30.978
- Shame.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.457
Shame, Terrence Jeffords,
shame!

10:32.501 --> 10:33.981
You probably didn't
realize this, Jake,

10:34.024 --> 10:36.070
but the lieutenant over here
is trying to bribe you.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.332
- Yeah, I don't think
he's hiding that.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.073
- I am not.
- Well, neither am I.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.162
Here's a check for $200.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.338
- Another silver dollar.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.296
Ooh, looks like I'm up to 276.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.604
- Well, here's a second check
for $77.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.737
I am up one dollar.
- Four more.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.260
- How many silver dollars
do you have?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.696
- As many as it takes.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.567
- Well, this checkbook
is only on 304,

10:55.611 --> 10:57.439
so I can write checks
all day long.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.614
- Well, you know what?
Here's my watch.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.398
- Yeah, melt this down.
- Enough!

11:00.442 --> 11:01.965
I'm tired of being stuck
in the middle of this.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.141
You figure out who gets
the tickets and tell me.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.275
That should keep them busy
for a little while.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.538
- Hey, Jake, we've decided
how to settle this.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.106
- We're gonna duke it out
in the ring.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.847
- What?

11:13.890 --> 11:16.371
- That man is lying.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.156
I don't believe Wuntch
had another rival.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.288
I saw it in her eyes.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.333
She only had hate for me.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.466
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I am.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.469
I despised her
with my entire being

11:27.512 --> 11:29.645
while she was only despising me
with a fraction of hers?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.995
- Sir, you were doing so well,
okay?

11:32.039 --> 11:33.388
Don't let this rattle you.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.781
- Are you wearing sponges
in your armpits?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.173
- If you have a better way
to soak up sweat,

11:36.217 --> 11:37.174
I would like to hear it.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.610
- Where are you going?

11:38.654 --> 11:41.875
- To find out
if there was another man.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.313
So, um, Adam is it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.489
- I only ask because
Madeline never mentioned you.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.404
- Interesting,
'cause she mentioned you to me,

11:49.447 --> 11:51.145
as a friend.
- Friend?

11:51.188 --> 11:52.755
- Mm.
- I think you added an "R"

11:52.799 --> 11:54.626
to the word "fiend."
- No, I'm sure it was friend.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.411
I mean, based on context alone,

11:56.454 --> 11:58.021
I wouldn't say somebody was one
of my closest fiends.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.544
- Oh, you might.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.807
We had a very
contentious relationship.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.852
She never forgave me
for embarrassing her

12:02.896 --> 12:04.288
in front of Derek Jeter.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.986
- Well, I embarrassed her
in front of A-Rod

12:06.029 --> 12:07.988
and J.Lo together.

12:08.031 --> 12:10.251
- For 15 years I replaced
her anti-wrinkle cream

12:10.294 --> 12:11.643
with sour cream.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.776
- I replaced her Lactaid pills
with Tic Tacs.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.517
Dead moron was crapping
her pants for months.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.779
- She hacked into
my Netflix account

12:16.823 --> 12:18.389
and watched
the "Lizzie McGuire" movie

12:18.433 --> 12:19.956
on repeat to ruin my algorithm.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.349
- She made me guard that doctor

12:21.392 --> 12:23.177
who came back
to New York with Ebola.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.526
- Sir, maybe you want
to keep it down.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.441
There's people--
- That witch ruined my life!

12:26.484 --> 12:28.791
She demoted me from captain
to uniformed officer.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.751
- Eight years ago she had me
kicked off the force entirely.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.448
You were not
her greatest rival,

12:33.491 --> 12:35.276
and the proof is right here.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.364
- Hello, Adam.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.061
I may be dying

12:38.105 --> 12:39.715
but I burned down
your cabin in Maine.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.805
You were my one true rival.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.024
- There you have it.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.811
- I meant nothing to her.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.467
That cockroach Madeline
was two-timing me!

12:55.252 --> 12:56.688
- No sign of Holt anywhere.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.777
- I know that's important,

12:57.820 --> 12:58.690
but I don't think
I can just breeze past

12:58.734 --> 12:59.822
the outfit,
"Sister Act."

12:59.866 --> 13:01.171
- I sweat through my clothes

13:01.215 --> 13:02.825
and I found this in the back
of a closet, okay?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
Deal with it.
- You look great.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.697
- Oh, there he is.
Sir, over here.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.047
- Where are you?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.005
Why are you holding
the mean yelling speech?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.485
- Because I'm gonna yell it,
meanly.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.967
I wasted half my life hating
that duplicitous hag,

13:14.010 --> 13:15.359
and she didn't even have
the decency

13:15.403 --> 13:16.752
to truly hate me back.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.188
Well, screw her.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.364
I'm gonna ruin her memorial.
- No, you can't do that.

13:20.408 --> 13:23.367
If you read that speech,
you'll be fired.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.716
- You're right.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.849
And that would ruin my career.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.720
And it's worth it.

13:28.764 --> 13:29.852
I'm giving the speech.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.463
- No,
that's what Wuntch wanted.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.770
You're letting her win.
- Sweaty Amy's right.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.727
If you really wanna
get back at her,

13:35.771 --> 13:36.772
you'll team up with Adam

13:36.816 --> 13:38.078
and give her a nice funeral.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.862
- It's like
" The Durrells of Corfu"

13:39.906 --> 13:42.038
when Prudence and Louisa
joined forces--

13:42.082 --> 13:44.171
- To sink the catamaran
of the bookseller Yorgos

13:44.214 --> 13:47.087
who wronged them both.
Yes!

13:47.130 --> 13:50.003
I will team up with Adam.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.482
Wow.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.397
For a moment there,

13:53.441 --> 13:56.009
I almost forgot who
the real villain was.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.273
The woman who recently died.
- Mm.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.188
- Charles, why did you
let Terry choose boxing?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.842
- He didn't.
I picked it.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.887
- But you'll die.
- Don't worry about it.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.149
Boxing's in my blood.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.847
My Nana Boyle boxed
in the Navy.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.893
- I'm sure she did but--
and hear me out--

14:10.937 --> 14:12.634
what if you're not as strong
as your Nana Boyle?

14:12.677 --> 14:13.896
- I can handle myself.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.550
She taught me
her signature punch;

14:15.593 --> 14:17.987
the Strawberry Basket.
- That does not reassure me.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.597
Hey there, big guy.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.905
You sure you're feeling okay
about ending Charles' life?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
- Yep, my girls
are gonna see this movie.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.953
- Right, well,
before you commit manslaughter,

14:26.996 --> 14:28.780
I do feel compelled
to tell you that the movie

14:28.824 --> 14:30.434
only has a 38
on Rotten Tomatoes.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.436
- Jake, stop yapping
and let them fight.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.482
- I wanna see the big guy pop
the little guy's head off.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.744
- Yeah, let's start the fight!

14:35.787 --> 14:37.093
I wanna pop that
little guy's head off!

14:37.137 --> 14:38.529
- You're clearly
the little guy.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.704
Good one, Jake.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.968
- All right.
I guess this is happening.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.621
Touch gloves.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.017
Charles, it's been very nice
being your friend.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.584
Terry, I'll visit you
in prison.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.716
And...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.022
Fight.
- Strawberry basket!

14:55.503 --> 14:56.591
- Whoo, yeah!

14:56.634 --> 14:57.635
You mess with Grandma,

14:57.679 --> 14:58.941
you're gonna get the basket!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.160
- Charles, you punched him
in the nards.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.944
- Yeah, Nana fought nasty.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.641
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like those tickets.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.295
- I didn't hear no bell!

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
- Jake, I think those
tickets are mine.

15:08.472 --> 15:11.606
- Strawberry basket!

15:11.649 --> 15:15.001
- Guys, stop!
It's a movie about cupcakes!

15:15.044 --> 15:17.481
- You don't understand!
- You don't have kids!

15:18.961 --> 15:21.355
- Wow, that speech
would have been amazing.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.444
I had to look up what
a toilet ghost was.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.924
- Uh, yes,
I took a trip to Korea

15:24.967 --> 15:26.838
just to research
a new Wuntch insult.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.144
In fact it's been a motivation

15:28.188 --> 15:29.580
for most
of my international travel.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.495
- Mm.
- So you guys are friends now?

15:31.539 --> 15:33.497
- Uh, yes, it seems we have
a great deal in common.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.977
- Well, one thing.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.326
both: Hating Wuntch.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.285
I read him the obituary
I wrote for her,

15:38.328 --> 15:39.547
but the "Times" wouldn't
publish it.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.635
It had too many obscenities.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.159
- And I read him
my all caps speech.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.335
- And I loved it.
It was like poetry.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.511
- Madeline smelled
like dog crap.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.166
- Raymond convinced me the best
way to get back at Wuntch

15:50.210 --> 15:51.907
is to make sure
he doesn't get fired.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.475
Also I'm just gonna chisel
a penis onto her headstone.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.780
- And I'm gonna watch.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.173
- Please take your seats.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.653
- Well, uh, time for me to go

15:58.696 --> 15:59.871
make a tear-jerker of a speech.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.482
- Hey, I thought
of the best hashtag

16:01.525 --> 16:03.136
to post with my photo
of the grave penis.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.746
- I'm not on board
with that friendship.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.226
- Yeah, there's something
weird about that guy.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.010
Hey, when did he say
he got kicked off the force?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.707
- Eight years ago.
- That doesn't add up.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.927
He said Wuntch sent him
to guard the Ebola doctor.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.581
Wasn't that six years ago?
- Yeah.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.799
- Oh, my God.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
Wuntch sent him
to destroy Holt.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.019
- Good afternoon.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.803
On this sad day,

16:18.847 --> 16:21.371
I'd like to say a few words
about Commissioner Wuntch.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.634
Madeline smelled
like dog crap.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.636
I'm sorry.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.768
I--I don't know what--

16:26.811 --> 16:28.770
From a sick dog.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.511
Adam, what are you doing?

16:30.554 --> 16:33.862
- I'm showing everyone your
true colors, Raymond Holt.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.516
Enjoy the show, people!

16:38.693 --> 16:41.522
- Madeline Wuntch
will not soon be forgotten.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.958
Trick or Treaters will dress
like her for generations.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.482
- Hey!
- Diaz, delete all the videos.

16:45.526 --> 16:46.918
- Deleted.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.790
- It's over.
- Yeah, for you.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.661
Everyone who's anyone in NYPD

16:50.705 --> 16:52.533
just saw you
for your true self.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.710
Your career is ruined, Ray-Ray.
- Who are you?

16:55.753 --> 16:58.408
Why are you doing this?
- I'm Madeline Wuntch's nephew.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.714
She sent me here to carry out

16:59.757 --> 17:01.411
the final phase
of her master plan,

17:01.455 --> 17:03.935
and now it's all over.
Wait, why are you smiling?

17:03.979 --> 17:08.418
- Because, Adam, this isn't
the real memorial.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.073
It's all a ruse.
- What?

17:11.117 --> 17:12.205
- Yeah, what?

17:12.248 --> 17:13.249
- I knew Wuntch had one

17:13.293 --> 17:14.294
final trick up her sleeve.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.730
I didn't know what it was,

17:15.773 --> 17:17.297
so I had to be prepared
for anything.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.560
This whole thing was staged.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.909
None of these people
are real mourners.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.737
They're not even in the NYPD.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.869
- You hired actors?
- Worse.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.481
They're members
of local improv troupes,

17:27.524 --> 17:30.571
and they did it for
"the exposure."

17:30.614 --> 17:32.225
- This has been a blast,

17:32.268 --> 17:33.922
but we have to go start a flash
mob at the Freedom Tower.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.184
Oh, check out
our YouTube channel.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.577
- No.
Sit down.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.534
- I have to hand it to you,
Adam.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.622
You almost fooled me,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.450
but no other man could possibly

17:40.494 --> 17:41.712
have what Wuntch and I had.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.846
We were star-crossed haters.

17:44.889 --> 17:45.760
- Whatever.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.066
I still inherit half her estate

17:47.109 --> 17:48.763
just for trying this.
- Cool.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.200
Who gets the other half
of every child's nightmares?

17:51.244 --> 17:54.029
- I love it, Rosa.
Great work all day.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.685
- So how are you two feeling
after your little boxing match?

17:57.728 --> 18:00.079
- My head hurts.
- I can't feel my strawberries.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.951
- I meant more emotionally
and less groinally,

18:02.994 --> 18:04.866
but listen, ever since I brought
these tickets up,

18:04.909 --> 18:07.086
you guys have made my life
absolutely miserable,

18:07.129 --> 18:09.175
but that ends now,
because I've made a choice.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.915
- Cagney is sick.
We don't know how long she has.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.830
- We do know for Nikolaj.
It's 36 hours.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.832
- Just stop, all right?
Stop lying.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.486
This is exactly the type
of behavior

18:16.530 --> 18:20.403
that has led me to decide that
I'm not taking either of you.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.101
- Seriously?
Oh, man.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.798
The kids are gonna be
so disappointed.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.105
- No, they won't,
because they're going.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.150
That's right,
I'm bringing all three of them

18:28.194 --> 18:30.805
by myself
and you two don't get to go.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.590
Your childish behavior
has led you to miss out

18:33.634 --> 18:35.897
on the most exciting movie
premiere event

18:35.940 --> 18:37.942
in the state of New York
this Saturday.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.990
I hope you've learned
your lesson.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.905
Good day.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.170
Wait.
He's taking the kids for us?

18:48.214 --> 18:49.563
- It's just like getting
a free babysitter.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.999
- This is incredible.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.827
People without kids
are so stupid.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.742
- They're gonna destroy him.
- Yeah.

18:55.699 --> 18:56.874
- So just to be clear,

18:56.918 --> 18:58.615
this service is actually real,
right?

18:58.659 --> 19:00.182
- Oh, yes.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.314
I figured if I needed
two fake memorials

19:01.357 --> 19:02.532
to smoke out Wuntch's plan,

19:02.576 --> 19:03.620
she deserved to win,

19:03.664 --> 19:04.795
but she didn't win.
I did.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.188
Finally beat the old fishwife.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.537
- It's crazy.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.756
After today you never
have to think

19:08.799 --> 19:10.671
about Madeline Wuntch again.

19:10.714 --> 19:11.889
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.674
- Sir, does that make you sad?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.545
- I don't know.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.591
I think maybe...

19:18.983 --> 19:20.333
Yes?

19:20.376 --> 19:22.073
- Well, I think it's natural

19:22.117 --> 19:24.119
to feel a little down
about her death.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.688
For the last 20 years,
your lives have been entangled.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.255
- Because of her ratty hair.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.865
No, it's not the same.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.214
Now it just feels like
I'm insulting

19:32.258 --> 19:34.216
a helpless dead person.
- You are.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.262
It's what you've been doing
all week.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.611
- Yeah, it's been tight.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.049
- Well, it's time
for my speech.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.182
- Sir, what are
you gonna say?

19:43.225 --> 19:45.445
- I don't know.

19:45.488 --> 19:46.533
Maybe I'll just be honest.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.537
- Did he say he
was gonna be honest?

19:50.580 --> 19:51.625
- Yeah, this is gonna be bad.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.017
- As many of you know,

19:53.061 --> 19:55.324
Madeline and I
were bitter rivals,

19:55.368 --> 19:56.847
but I've come to realize

19:56.891 --> 19:58.153
she held a special place
in my life.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.765
No one challenged me
like she did

20:01.809 --> 20:04.725
or made me feel as alive.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.945
Our relationship was like
an epic chess match.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.601
And it's hard
to believe that...

20:13.473 --> 20:15.823
She'll never make another move.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.130
Unless...

20:20.523 --> 20:22.656
No, it's just a notification.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.571
Cheddar's doggy toothpaste
has shipped.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.791
So she is gone,

20:27.835 --> 20:29.663
and I wish she were not.

20:31.142 --> 20:34.363
I will miss you,
Madeline Wuntch.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.279
Wario, why are you like this?

20:37.323 --> 20:40.413
- Hey, so I don't know
if you noticed,

20:40.456 --> 20:42.893
but ever since I started
those hormone treatments--

20:42.937 --> 20:44.373
- I didn't notice anything.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.722
- You said that way too quick.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.637
- I mean, you did cry
at that one car commercial

20:47.681 --> 20:49.117
and it wasn't even
an emotional one.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.075
It was about towing capacity.
- Yeah.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.860
Well, I called the doctor

20:52.903 --> 20:55.297
to see if that was
a common side effect

20:55.341 --> 20:57.212
and apparently, it isn't.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.518
- Oh, no.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.433
Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

21:00.476 --> 21:03.436
She did have one guess
as to what might be causing it.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.742
And, um, she was right.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.793
Ames.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.057
Are we having a baby?
- We're having a baby.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.802
- It happened!

21:21.845 --> 21:23.760
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.936
- Fremulon.
