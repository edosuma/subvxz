WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:04.963
Damn.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.258
Who?

00:08.967 --> 00:10.135
Who shot...

00:26.359 --> 00:27.944
Stop Kikuhara.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.238
Kikuhara.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.705
Kikuhara.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.501
You can't shoot me, can you?

02:17.428 --> 02:19.013
Can you make it to the roof?

02:19.222 --> 02:21.724
If I don't move fast,
they might see us and shoot!

02:22.433 --> 02:23.601
Hold on tight!

02:26.813 --> 02:28.565
Something is coming from the north!
The roof!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.486
Fools! Why are you here?

02:35.613 --> 02:36.614
Sorry!

02:36.781 --> 02:37.699
I'm fine.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.372
Don't resist! Put down
your weapons and surrender!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.043
Can you hear me?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.046
What's the matter?
Hurry up and drop your--

02:52.130 --> 02:54.382
Ms. Taira and Lee are on the roof?

02:54.799 --> 02:56.676
Why are they here?

02:57.051 --> 02:58.052
No way.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.804
Don't move! I'll shoot!

03:00.597 --> 03:01.598
The roof!

03:04.183 --> 03:05.852
Don't go to the roof.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.105
You'll get in the way.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.156
Tsukasa? Why?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.951
Stay away. It's dangerous.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.204
Stay away...

03:27.999 --> 03:30.335
Mr. Anzai, can you hear me? Mr. Anzai!

03:31.169 --> 03:32.170
Sedatives.

03:32.503 --> 03:36.341
Lee, how much blood do we need
to heal his wound?

03:37.508 --> 03:40.261
Considering his wound and the amount
of blood lost, normally 200ml.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.597
But in this situation, we need 400ml.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.307
Four hundred.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.268
He was sedated before he was shot.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.687
That means he'll have
difficulty transforming.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.856
Twice the usual amount of blood
should fix that.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.735
This time, if vampires
break the deployment ban,

03:55.902 --> 03:58.988
if they transform, turn violent,
cause injury, or drink blood,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.783
they will be fired immediately,
regardless of the reason.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.203
And then they will be put
under strict surveillance

04:05.286 --> 04:06.996
and be banned from contact with humans.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.540
Thanks.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.003
Giving 400ml of blood would put
Ms. Taira in danger.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.797
I'll give my blood, too.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.883
Who are you talking to?
Put down your weapons at once!

04:21.219 --> 04:24.555
Please stop the riot squad.
I'll stop the bleeding!

04:26.599 --> 04:30.270
I really wish I could give you my blood,

04:31.062 --> 04:33.022
if it would help you.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.943
Don't worry.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.988
I promise not to give you my blood!

04:42.031 --> 04:43.116
I'm sorry.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.931
It's too slow!

05:08.099 --> 05:10.018
If you overdo it, you'll...

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
Bite me! Mr. Anzai!

05:12.937 --> 05:14.439
Wake up and bite me!

05:14.522 --> 05:17.108
Mr. Anzai!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.612
Ms. Taira, they've broken through! Hurry!

05:35.793 --> 05:36.878
Tsukasa.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.056
-Mr. Anzai--
-Push your arm down, or he'll rip it off!

05:57.815 --> 05:59.484
Don't move! Stay where you are--

05:59.567 --> 06:01.319
Hold on. We're almost done!

06:02.570 --> 06:03.988
There is a vampire on the rooftop.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.578
Mr. Anzai, I'm okay.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.176
I'm okay.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.724
Just don't die.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.065
His wound has started to heal.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.902
Hey, you over there. Help me!

06:43.277 --> 06:45.196
Look for a tranquilizer in his pouch.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.823
When I give the signal, inject him, okay?

06:46.948 --> 06:47.782
What?

06:48.116 --> 06:51.953
Do it, if you want to save our lives!
Please!

06:53.538 --> 06:54.497
Ogata!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.875
Keep watch! If anything happens,
take us all down!

06:58.543 --> 07:00.336
There are two kinds! Which one?

07:00.920 --> 07:01.754
The thick one!

07:05.466 --> 07:06.300
It's healing!

07:06.884 --> 07:07.718
Inject him!

07:21.190 --> 07:22.525
Has the ambulance arrived?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.445
I think it should be here soon.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.363
Don't kill him.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.574
He won't be acting up.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.617
Wait. Where are you...

07:31.993 --> 07:32.869
Hey!

07:34.704 --> 07:35.663
What is that?

07:36.664 --> 07:39.667
I'm carrying an injured person,
so don't shoot!

07:46.007 --> 07:48.676
A vampire bit her,
and she has lost some blood.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.344
-Please help her.
-Okay!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.763
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015
Bring out the stretcher!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.227
Tsukasa?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.188
Don't move!

08:00.354 --> 08:01.522
On your knees!

08:01.772 --> 08:02.899
Don't resist!

08:05.276 --> 08:07.487
His eyes are red! Be careful!

08:07.737 --> 08:09.071
What do you intend to do to me?

08:10.114 --> 08:12.033
As a safety precaution,
you'll be arrested!

08:13.201 --> 08:16.871
I think you have your guns pointed
at the wrong person.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.708
Requesting a stretcher on the roof.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.085
We have one male vampire, tranquilized.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.213
Injuries,

08:27.673 --> 08:28.591
none.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.471
In a residential neighborhood,

08:33.596 --> 08:36.057
it appears that an incident
involving vampires has occurred.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.017
Details are unclear yet,

08:38.100 --> 08:39.477
but the riot police have been deployed,

08:39.560 --> 08:41.896
-and several are suspected to be dead.
-Vanquish the vampires!

08:44.857 --> 08:47.026
Squad F, private line calling.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.655
The chief of Division 11 was contacted
by Squad Leader Ishimaru.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.822
Who is this?

08:52.406 --> 08:53.908
Must be Makimura.

08:54.951 --> 09:00.915
It's possible that the central government
was involved in the formation of the CCC.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.210
The object of your investigation
is to be re-examined.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.128
One more thing,

09:07.004 --> 09:09.215
there is evidence
that Kikuhara was planning

09:09.298 --> 09:11.467
to replace the group members.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.595
Now, the members might be killed.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.598
They are crucial eyewitnesses
in this case.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.101
You must not allow them to be killed.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.025
Are you stuck?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.111
Jump!

09:30.861 --> 09:31.862
I'll catch you.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.956
I'm looking for the vampire
mass murderer, Tamaki Anzai.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.833
He killed so many people.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.503
He's your real father.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.630
Real father?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.633
He was given the death penalty,

09:53.134 --> 09:55.303
but for some reason,
he was secretly released from prison

09:55.928 --> 09:57.638
and was apparently moved here.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.693
This is scary! I want to go home!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.029
In a way,

10:13.529 --> 10:16.115
these make up the darkness
found within every human.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.703
Everyone here is a vampire.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.955
Just like you and me.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.096
This one killed 15 people.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.973
The very definition of a mass murderer.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.475
Tamaki Anzai.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.812
Your father.

10:47.063 --> 10:47.980
A vampire.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.357
My father.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.108
A murderer...

11:03.371 --> 11:05.539
Stop! You shouldn't sit up.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.625
I'm Feng, your attending physician.

11:07.917 --> 11:08.918
How are you feeling?

11:09.794 --> 11:10.795
I'm in the hospital?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.672
That's right, the second level
basement of Shirase Hospital.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.424
The Vampires' Ward.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.720
Your wounds have healed on the surface,
but you've lost a lot of blood, so...

11:20.137 --> 11:23.808
Wasn't there a girl brought in with me?
A girl with short hair.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.518
Tsukasa Taira?

11:26.769 --> 11:29.188
She's on the third floor.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.857
Her life isn't in danger. She'll be fine.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.150
Really?

11:33.442 --> 11:34.402
Well...

11:35.152 --> 11:38.823
her left arm was broken,
it also had a cut and a deep bite,

11:38.906 --> 11:40.324
so we treated her for those injuries.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.202
Her arm was fractured, but we set it.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.039
Looks like she made you bite her.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.626
I bit Tsukasa?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.671
But,

11:54.547 --> 11:59.885
I thought I had gained control
over myself. I was so close...

12:02.430 --> 12:03.931
Just remember this,

12:04.348 --> 12:06.851
there wasn't any time
to wait for medical treatment.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.937
If your wounds
hadn't been healed immediately,

12:10.729 --> 12:13.607
if she hadn't been there,
you would have died.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.654
She made the right decision.

12:22.491 --> 12:26.203
Yesterday, an unknown individual
attacked Naoya Ushio.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.914
He appears to have escaped
relatively unharmed.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.252
At the detention center earlier,
Kohei Nakamura,

12:33.335 --> 12:36.005
who was known as Zero-Four,
stole a gun from a guard

12:36.088 --> 12:37.882
and died in the shootout later on.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.010
They said Kikuhara paid him
a visit yesterday.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.344
Kikuhara did?

12:43.053 --> 12:46.140
Let's stop Officer Kikuhara
from proceeding.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.933
I'll have someone track him.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.478
But if Makimura is right,

12:50.561 --> 12:52.897
and multiple government agencies
are involved, pulling the strings,

12:53.147 --> 12:56.066
even if we stop Kikuhara,
the murders will continue.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.737
Don't worry about the rest.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.157
As of today, Squad F is dissolved.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.456
Would you consider leniency with regards
to Officer Anzai's punishment?

13:12.208 --> 13:15.419
Ishimaru and I owe our lives to him.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.966
The verdict took that into account.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.094
Squad F is dissolved?

13:24.303 --> 13:25.971
What a great guess.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.932
I knew it
as soon as I saw Sawazaki's face.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.853
Wow, amazing!
His face always looks the same to me.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.314
I've known him for a longer time.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.652
Anyway, we've all been suspended
for 20 days,

13:40.319 --> 13:41.987
and Ishimaru and I were given pay cuts.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.156
Squad F has been terminated,

13:44.323 --> 13:46.909
and its jurisdiction will be divided
between the other squads.

13:47.326 --> 13:52.331
I'll be returning to Internal Affairs.
Asami, you'll return to Division 1.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.459
Sawazaki will be the head
of Division 5, Section 1.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.169
The Head of General Affairs, right?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.672
Lloyd will be transferred to Squad Y.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.758
Yanagi will return to the hospital
where he used to work.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.679
It's sad, but I guess this is goodbye.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.157
Mr. Anzai!

14:29.994 --> 14:30.828
Miwako?

14:32.037 --> 14:34.623
Tsukasa! What a relief!

14:34.707 --> 14:35.749
MS. TSUKASA TAIRA

14:35.833 --> 14:38.794
A vampire saved your life, right?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.254
What?

14:40.337 --> 14:42.673
I saw it on TV. A vampire with long hair.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.216
Oh, Lee.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.679
Everyone is afraid of vampires right now,
and things are a mess,

14:49.513 --> 14:51.098
but that's not the whole story, is it?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.141
Miwako.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.688
There are vampires we can trust.
I feel like I understand that now.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.525
I'm sure I'm not the only one.
There are a lot more people who do.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.697
His sentence has been decided.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.451
Anzai will likely decide to retire.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.328
But,

15:13.037 --> 15:15.623
he'll be placed under strict surveillance

15:15.956 --> 15:20.461
and be prohibited from making contact
with any human involved.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.298
Considering what happened last time,
plus the Ikebukuro incident,

15:24.381 --> 15:27.468
public opinion has turned even harsher.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.721
The Redeye Protection Bill
has already been submitted

15:30.804 --> 15:32.681
to the National Diet of Japan,

15:33.265 --> 15:36.518
but in reality,
it will only restrict vampires' rights.

15:38.062 --> 15:42.399
Considering the current state of things,
this sentence was inevitable.

15:43.067 --> 15:43.901
But,

15:44.568 --> 15:47.738
I honestly wish
you could stay by Anzai's side.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.200
Inter-species couples like you two

15:52.159 --> 15:54.995
give hope to all those wishing
for a peaceful coexistence.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.292
Is that right? Squad F...

16:01.043 --> 16:04.713
I had asked if there was any way
your sentence could be adjusted, but...

16:05.547 --> 16:06.548
No, it's fine.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.677
If something like this happened again,

16:10.803 --> 16:14.431
I might kill Tsukasa.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.517
Vampires

16:18.394 --> 16:20.396
have no right to live with humans.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.693
In the end, vampires are...

16:29.613 --> 16:32.366
I don't intend to comment
on your relationship with Ms. Taira.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.619
I also can't tell you
whether you can exist together.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.204
But,

16:37.955 --> 16:39.123
no matter what happens,

16:39.790 --> 16:41.875
I would like it
if we could all live together.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.878
Do you feel differently?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.214
No!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
But...

16:51.218 --> 16:52.720
Will you talk to Ms. Taira?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.306
Starting tomorrow afternoon,

16:56.515 --> 16:59.727
you will be banned from contacting Anzai.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.022
If you need to tell him anything,
make sure you tell him before that time.

17:04.064 --> 17:04.982
If I meet her,

17:05.524 --> 17:06.859
what should I say?

17:07.484 --> 17:08.485
I still...

17:08.944 --> 17:09.903
Anzai.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.157
Did you ever recall
your memories after that?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.285
When I was a child,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.204
I met Kikuhara at ONLO.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.415
He was working
in the underground facility,

17:21.915 --> 17:23.375
and he brought me to my father,

17:24.918 --> 17:26.253
Tamaki Anzai.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.423
He said he was a vampire
who committed mass murder.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.553
Your father, Tamaki Anzai,

17:35.095 --> 17:37.056
before meeting your mother,

17:37.139 --> 17:38.682
had a human lover.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.061
But she was killed by other humans.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.399
Tamaki took revenge on her killers.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.944
But he drank the blood
of the men he killed

17:51.028 --> 17:52.446
and lost control of himself,

17:52.571 --> 17:56.241
eventually murdering some bystanders,
a total of 15 people.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.578
Having lost his lover
and committed murder,

17:59.953 --> 18:05.000
by the time he was brought to ONLO,
he was like the living dead.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.212
Knowing his past,

18:08.378 --> 18:12.633
why did your mother fall in love with him?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.304
She said
she couldn't really explain it herself.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
But the first time she met him...

18:21.350 --> 18:22.726
I couldn't stop thinking about him.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.147
When I went to see him again,
I fell in love.

18:28.732 --> 18:32.152
Even if you are a vampire,
that doesn't define you.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.823
If you focus on just one part of yourself,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.950
your way of thinking will keep drifting
in that direction.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.911
Have courage

18:41.537 --> 18:43.122
and face the one you love.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.672
Did you hear about the verdict?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.092
Yes, I'm glad you called me.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.762
I have something I need to tell you.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.057
I'm glad you're alive.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.352
Thanks for saving me.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.024
I thought I had found

19:11.900 --> 19:15.154
a clue to confronting
the vampire within me.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.031
If I held on a little longer,

19:18.198 --> 19:19.992
I might have been able

19:20.951 --> 19:23.120
to hold my hopes and dreams
with these two hands.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.914
I'm sorry.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.583
That's not what I mean!

19:27.916 --> 19:30.752
If you hadn't given me your blood,
I would have died!

19:31.712 --> 19:32.880
But, that's not it.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.592
You're the one who brought me this far.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.343
If I lose you now,

19:38.760 --> 19:42.431
I'll lose everything
I've worked so hard to get.

19:42.806 --> 19:43.765
I'm terrified.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.475
You'll be fine!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.227
I'm sure you will be.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.689
I hated the vampire inside of me.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.441
I hated myself.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.571
That's why when you said you liked me,

19:58.906 --> 20:00.741
with that bright smile of yours,

20:01.241 --> 20:02.910
I couldn't handle it.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.289
Would you let me hear that once more?

20:07.831 --> 20:08.790
That you...

20:10.667 --> 20:12.836
I love you, Mr. Anzai.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.005
I love you, too.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.800
Look at me and say it again.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.263
I love you.

20:27.100 --> 20:27.935
Don't worry!

20:28.727 --> 20:29.728
I'll be waiting.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.034
I have to keep going.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.205
If Mr. Anzai is moving forward,

20:51.833 --> 20:54.211
then I will, too.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.662
Nice haircut!

22:53.663 --> 22:54.664
It's cool.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.003
You've gotten so beautiful.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.523
