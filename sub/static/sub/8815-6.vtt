<i>LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer.</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:04.369
Lucifer Morningstar..

00:04.437 --> 00:06.371
Is that a stage name or something?

00:06.439 --> 00:08.206
God-given, I'm afraid.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.541
Your return to the Underworld

00:09.608 --> 00:11.042
has been requested.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.011
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

00:13.079 --> 00:15.480
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.582
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.619
I'm now an official
civilian consultant for the LAPD.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.154
I want what's best for Lucifer.

00:23.222 --> 00:25.123
Then give me something
that I can use against Lucifer,

00:25.191 --> 00:27.271
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.927
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

00:28.994 --> 00:32.597
But there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.865
Hello there, neighbor.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.535
I actually need someone to
confide in about a patient.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.370
And hey, listen, if
you have any patients

00:39.438 --> 00:41.906
- you need to talk about...
- You have no idea.

00:41.974 --> 00:43.575
Just shoot me, Detective, please,

00:43.642 --> 00:45.510
because maybe you'll finally realize...

00:46.912 --> 00:47.612
You're bleeding.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.514
What's happening to me?

00:49.582 --> 00:52.417
You're changing, becoming vulnerable.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.018
Maybe even... (whispers) mortal.

00:54.086 --> 00:56.921
Oh, Mazie. I know that you'll
always protect me.

00:56.989 --> 01:00.792
No matter how mortal I
become, the Devil can depend on that.

03:40.452 --> 03:42.620
Cake is so not the point, Dan.

03:42.688 --> 03:44.422
This is about honesty

03:44.490 --> 03:46.157
and personal responsibility.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.092
Fine.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.530
I got this.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.334
Hey, Monkey.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.736
Do you remember when we had that talk

03:58.804 --> 04:01.172
and we said that
lying is a really bad thing?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.573
Well,

04:02.641 --> 04:04.442
some of your birthday cake is missing.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.577
Now, I didn't eat it,

04:06.645 --> 04:09.714
and we know Mommy didn't eat it, so...

04:09.782 --> 04:11.342
is there something you want to tell us?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.553
I ate it.

04:17.356 --> 04:18.356
Mm-hmm.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.458
But Lucifer said it was okay.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.226
Oh, really?

04:22.294 --> 04:23.607
(scoffs)

04:23.608 --> 04:24.940
He said, if you really want

04:25.130 --> 04:28.099
to do something, you should.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.269
And I really wanted to
eat some chocolate cake.

04:31.337 --> 04:33.504
Huh. That's...

04:34.707 --> 04:36.074
interesting.

hear advice from Lucifer

04:46.518 --> 04:48.619
is on the personal responsibility
lesson plan.

04:48.687 --> 04:49.620
Dan, it's not what you think.

04:49.688 --> 04:50.722
You know what, Chloe?

04:50.789 --> 04:52.123

I'm working a stakeout in Van Nuys.

09:27.502 --> 09:29.036
badly enough to steal it,

CHLOE: Okay, good. Let's check

10:10.011 --> 10:10.945
with the nearby businesses,

10:11.012 --> 10:11.979
- All right.
- and check the...

10:12.047 --> 10:13.848
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

10:13.915 --> 10:15.249
What? Have you thought of
all new offensive things

10:15.317 --> 10:16.751
- to say?
- No, I've changed mind.

10:16.818 --> 10:18.753
I've come back to help. Any leads yet?

10:18.820 --> 10:20.688
I need your help like
I need a third boob.

10:20.756 --> 10:21.856
- Mmm!
- Wait.

10:21.923 --> 10:23.724
Don't say a word. Knew it was a mistake

10:23.792 --> 10:25.355
the minute it came out of my mouth.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.361
We're partners, and I'm
offering you my services.

10:27.429 --> 10:29.830
I think you need a refresher course

10:29.898 --> 10:31.132
on how partnership works.

10:31.199 --> 10:32.900
You left me hanging, remember?

10:32.968 --> 10:34.735
Yes, but now I'm here
because of the robbery.

10:34.803 --> 10:36.270
Robbery? Why?

10:36.338 --> 10:38.239
Because the container that
was stolen was mine.

10:38.306 --> 10:40.975
You somehow left that out before.

10:41.042 --> 10:42.176
Well, I didn't know before.

10:42.244 --> 10:43.511
Maze handles
logistics... storage and such.

10:43.578 --> 10:46.247
And did you know that
this facility was used

10:46.314 --> 10:48.582
- to house illegal contraband?
- No.

10:48.650 --> 10:50.084
But what better place to store my stuff

10:50.152 --> 10:51.419
than somewhere
people hide illicit goods?

10:51.486 --> 10:52.520
Asking the obvious here,

10:52.587 --> 10:54.989
but was your stuff illegal
contraband, too?

10:55.056 --> 10:56.857
Define "illegal."

10:56.925 --> 10:58.526
What was in the container?

10:58.593 --> 11:01.262
- A personal item, insignificant.
- Yeah, but what was in it?

11:01.329 --> 11:02.963
The only thing I
brought with me to Los Angeles.

11:03.031 --> 11:04.198
I know, but you're not
answering the question.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.267
Look, I was storing
some stuff, it was stolen,

11:06.334 --> 11:07.568
the theft sets an awful precedent,

11:07.636 --> 11:09.737
so I'm obliged to make
the person responsible pay.

11:09.805 --> 11:12.406
Now, if you let me help,

11:12.474 --> 11:16.277
I'm certain we can solve
this case quickly.

11:16.344 --> 11:17.812
And I have a lead.

11:18.914 --> 11:21.115
♪ ♪

11:22.827 --> 11:23.884
Snow cones?

11:23.952 --> 11:24.952
This is your lead?

11:24.953 --> 11:26.353
We don't have time for this.

11:26.421 --> 11:27.922
We should be working.

11:27.989 --> 11:29.757
- What can I get you?
- Uh, yes.

11:29.825 --> 11:31.292
I'll have two Tropic Wonders

11:31.359 --> 11:33.536
and your face smashed into the ground.

11:33.561 --> 11:34.576
What?

11:36.164 --> 11:37.164
What the...?

11:37.232 --> 11:38.432
Lucifer, what are you doing? Stop!

11:38.500 --> 11:40.067
I believe they call this interrogating.

11:40.135 --> 11:41.402
CHLOE: Lucifer, stop!

11:41.470 --> 11:42.870
- He needs to tell me where my stuff is.
- CHLOE: Don't.

11:42.938 --> 11:44.618
- I just sell snow cones.
- CHLOE: Lucifer!

11:44.673 --> 11:45.973
This isn't how we do things.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.175
This pathetic sap's real
name is Frankie Costa,

11:48.243 --> 11:50.978
and his real job is
transporting and storing illegal goods.

11:51.046 --> 11:52.980
Maze set up the warehouse through him.

11:53.048 --> 11:55.249
So if someone knew to
rob it, he'd be involved.

11:55.317 --> 11:56.217
(grunting nervously)

11:56.284 --> 11:57.852
I wouldn't steal from my own operation.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.321
That warehouse is off-limits.

12:00.388 --> 12:01.388
Hey, man.

12:01.456 --> 12:03.657
I'm trying to get out
of the storage racket.

12:03.725 --> 12:04.725
Yes, focus, Frankie.

12:04.726 --> 12:05.726
Who took my property?

12:05.727 --> 12:06.760
I don't know.

12:06.828 --> 12:08.662
I'm trying to find out myself.

12:08.730 --> 12:09.897
This is bad for business.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.098
And who would know
about the storage service?

12:11.166 --> 12:11.932
Who are you?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.767
I'm someone with one of these.

12:13.835 --> 12:14.768
But this guy doesn't have one.

12:14.836 --> 12:16.036
So say if I were to walk away,

12:16.037 --> 12:18.272
he can do whatever he wants to you.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.274
Of if you're not
responsible, you can point us

12:20.342 --> 12:22.409
in the right direction
of someone who is. Cool?

12:22.477 --> 12:23.744
(gasping): Okay, okay.

12:23.812 --> 12:25.779
Los Diablos.

12:25.847 --> 12:26.981
The biker club?

12:27.048 --> 12:28.315
Yeah.

12:28.383 --> 12:30.484
I run the warehouse, but
they run the docks.

12:30.552 --> 12:33.821
If anything went down, they
would know about it.

12:33.889 --> 12:35.222
That's all I know.

12:35.290 --> 12:36.423
I swear.

12:36.491 --> 12:38.158
All right, all right.

12:38.226 --> 12:39.960
Fine.

12:43.498 --> 12:45.232
That was incredible.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.967
It was musical, poetic really.

12:47.035 --> 12:48.702
We were like fish and
chips, salt and pepper.

12:48.770 --> 12:49.970
Hipsters and condescension.

12:50.038 --> 12:51.038
Give me one good reason

12:51.072 --> 12:53.240
why I shouldn't arrest you for assault.

12:53.308 --> 12:54.708
Fine, Frankie's a complete scumbag,

12:54.776 --> 12:55.709
and he skimps on the cherry syrup.

12:55.777 --> 12:56.777
So that's two, actually.

12:56.778 --> 12:57.978
Uh, something's going on with you,

12:58.046 --> 12:59.780
and it has to do with that
mysterious container,

12:59.848 --> 13:01.088
so no more games... what's in it?

13:01.116 --> 13:02.550
(huffs)

13:02.617 --> 13:04.051
It was a gift from my father.

13:04.119 --> 13:05.519
That's still not an answer.

13:05.587 --> 13:06.867
I mean, what, was it his memoirs?

13:06.888 --> 13:08.856
Some priceless porn collection?

13:08.924 --> 13:10.024
Look, if we're gonna
work together on this,

13:10.091 --> 13:12.760
you're gonna have
to trust me, all right?

13:14.362 --> 13:16.330
You're right, we
shouldn't work together on this.

13:16.398 --> 13:17.231
(scoffs)

13:17.299 --> 13:19.767
Aren't we being a touch dramatic?

13:19.834 --> 13:21.168
You know, I put up with a lot of crap

13:21.236 --> 13:22.436
to let you in on my cases,

13:22.504 --> 13:24.138
and that's because thus
far you've been honest with me,

13:24.205 --> 13:26.774
but now, for some reason,
you're not telling me the full story.

13:26.841 --> 13:28.075
I'm telling you

13:28.143 --> 13:30.177
everything you need to
know to help find my stuff.

13:30.245 --> 13:32.546
A man was murdered, and all you
can talk about is your property?

13:32.614 --> 13:34.582
Yes, but if we find
it, then you find out

13:34.649 --> 13:37.084
who killed the security guard...
it's win-win.

13:37.152 --> 13:39.286
So, please, enlighten me.

13:39.354 --> 13:41.322
Under what rock
will we find Los Diablos?

13:41.389 --> 13:43.657
It's a very on-the-nose name,
if you ask me.

13:43.725 --> 13:44.892
We won't find them anywhere.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.860
It's a conflict of interest.

13:48.597 --> 13:50.764
(cell phone rings)

13:53.501 --> 13:56.637
Look, Chloe, I told you,
there's nothing I can do about tomorrow.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.938
Truce.

13:58.006 --> 13:59.640
This is a call for Dan the detective.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.608
All right?

14:00.675 --> 14:01.675
I need your help.

14:01.676 --> 14:02.676
Okay.

14:02.677 --> 14:03.877
It's about my case.

14:03.945 --> 14:05.179
Homicide at the docks.

14:05.246 --> 14:06.880
Security guard killed during a robbery.

14:06.948 --> 14:08.749
Yeah, that container that was stolen,

14:08.817 --> 14:10.017
it was Lucifer's.

14:10.085 --> 14:13.687
That storage facility was
filled with black market goods.

14:13.755 --> 14:16.323
Yeah, it was.

14:16.391 --> 14:18.425
You think what Lucifer had stored
in there may be illegal.

14:18.493 --> 14:20.694
Whatever is in that
container, he won't tell me.

14:20.762 --> 14:23.897
And for a man who's all
about over-sharing, says a lot,

14:23.965 --> 14:25.205
so I want you to look into him,

14:25.266 --> 14:27.368
try and find out what
he might be hiding.

Your boss has reported an operating loss

14:54.629 --> 14:56.163
So?

14:56.231 --> 14:58.165
So this club is packed every night.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.768
At 20 bucks an
appletini, it doesn't really add up.

15:03.905 --> 15:05.839
You're Chloe's ex, right?

15:05.907 --> 15:08.575
And you're Lucifer's pet on a leash.

15:08.643 --> 15:09.943
Now answer the question.

15:10.011 --> 15:12.413
Well, technically, that
wasn't a question.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.814
Is your divorce final yet?

15:13.882 --> 15:15.182
That's none of your business.

15:16.317 --> 15:17.651
Now, are you gonna show me your records,

15:17.719 --> 15:19.319
or do I need to get a warrant?

15:19.387 --> 15:20.387
We have nothing to hide.

That's great.

Well, pissed off, of course.

16:10.613 --> 16:13.482
Whatever was stolen from you
must have been very important.

Actually, no, it's the

I mean, nobody steals from
me and gets away with it.

This loss brings up an
issue that we've been skirting

since we began our work together.

- Right.
- Your identity.

so hard to become?

16:34.971 --> 16:36.171
Nobody.

16:36.239 --> 16:38.573
I'm completely unbecoming. (chuckles)

16:38.641 --> 16:40.909
And yet you keep trying on many
hats to hide your horns.

16:40.977 --> 16:42.878
Playboy, cop, club owner...

16:42.945 --> 16:45.313
Yes, you forgot "master of
all things tongue-related."

16:45.381 --> 16:47.382
Speaking of which, shall we?

16:47.450 --> 16:48.583
That's for later.

16:48.651 --> 16:51.553
I think we're onto
something very important here.

16:51.621 --> 16:55.390
One of the hardest things we ever do...

16:55.458 --> 16:56.792
is learn to be ourselves.

16:56.859 --> 17:00.962
I want you to tell me who you believe...

17:01.030 --> 17:03.865
is the real you.

17:07.670 --> 17:09.171
I...

17:10.272 --> 17:12.773
(sighs) I am...

17:12.842 --> 17:16.144
second-guessing your
skills as a therapist.

17:19.348 --> 17:20.714
You're feeling judged.

17:20.782 --> 17:22.050
(chuckles)

17:22.117 --> 17:23.185
So you're lashing out and judging me.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.252
But that's excellent.

17:24.287 --> 17:25.387
It's transference.

17:25.454 --> 17:26.887
Which means you seek my approval.

17:26.955 --> 17:28.690
I seek no one's approval.

17:30.193 --> 17:31.293
And time's up.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.894
Suddenly I'm no
longer in the amorous mood.

17:32.962 --> 17:35.197
Okay, hold on...

17:35.264 --> 17:37.332
Hold on, Lucifer.

17:39.068 --> 17:40.735
You think that's a fight.

17:40.803 --> 17:43.405
I think it's progress.

17:43.472 --> 17:47.142
Or maybe I'm just realizing
what a waste of time this is.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.877
(sighs)

17:52.982 --> 17:54.182
(knocking on door)

17:55.351 --> 17:57.252
I'm glad you came ba...

17:57.320 --> 17:59.354
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

17:59.422 --> 18:01.356
(chuckling): It's-it's you. Hi.

18:01.424 --> 18:04.559
I'm sorry, it's just, uh, thin walls.

18:04.627 --> 18:05.360
Oh.

18:05.428 --> 18:06.795
Yes, everything's fine.

18:08.698 --> 18:10.966
Uh, please.

18:11.033 --> 18:13.168
Thanks again for
drinks the other night, Linda.

18:14.237 --> 18:15.637
Uh, yeah.

18:15.705 --> 18:17.105
Yes, that was fun.

18:17.173 --> 18:18.974
Yeah.

18:19.041 --> 18:22.911
All right, so what kind of parent
names their kid Lucifer?

18:22.979 --> 18:24.446
(chuckles)

18:24.513 --> 18:26.281
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be unprofessional, but...

18:26.349 --> 18:27.849
We're colleagues. Cone of silence.

18:27.917 --> 18:31.186
And I don't believe his
real name is Lucifer.

18:32.054 --> 18:33.889
We talk in metaphors.

18:33.956 --> 18:35.156
Mmm.

18:35.224 --> 18:37.425
Patients with delusions.

18:37.493 --> 18:39.127
They can be really challenging.

18:39.195 --> 18:41.263
Mm, he's actually quite charming.

18:41.330 --> 18:44.266
Yeah, but even Satan disguises himself

18:44.333 --> 18:45.400
as an angel of the light.

18:45.468 --> 18:47.802
2 Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 14.

18:47.870 --> 18:49.838
Ah.

18:49.906 --> 18:51.740
Two years of seminary school

18:51.807 --> 18:55.076
before I decided I wanted to help
people in a different way.

18:55.144 --> 18:57.212
Ah. Interesting.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.949
I thought you seemed... pure.

19:01.017 --> 19:03.018
(both laugh)

19:03.085 --> 19:04.653
Listen, you really helped me
with my patient the other day,

19:04.720 --> 19:06.788
and I would love to return the favor.

19:06.856 --> 19:09.357
I know the Bible inside and out,

19:09.425 --> 19:11.660
so if you ever need a consult,

19:11.727 --> 19:13.828
just let me know.

19:27.376 --> 19:29.110
(gasps)

19:29.178 --> 19:31.379
(groans quietly)

19:41.157 --> 19:42.424
Whoa.

19:42.491 --> 19:44.192
CHLOE (distant): Just
quit defending him, Mom.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.661
You know Dan's never gonna change.

19:49.065 --> 19:50.131
Mm-hmm.

19:50.199 --> 19:53.201
What's for dinner, Mommy?

19:53.269 --> 19:55.470
Greens, you little cake monster.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.305
Yeah.

19:57.373 --> 20:00.308
I mean, I don't know why
I even bother telling you.

20:00.376 --> 20:02.610
He's-he's not gonna change, Mom.

20:02.678 --> 20:04.980
You know, Dan's just the way he is,

20:05.047 --> 20:06.481
and I wasn't asking for the world.

20:06.549 --> 20:08.450
I just wanted to see a little effort,

20:08.517 --> 20:09.617
and it's probably too late.

20:09.685 --> 20:14.222
Ah, it's pointless to
discuss this with you.

20:14.290 --> 20:17.726
Why? Because you always take his side.

20:19.128 --> 20:21.329
Look, Mom, I...

20:22.098 --> 20:23.098
- Daddy!
- Shh!

20:23.165 --> 20:25.633
- Hey, Monkey!
- What are you doing here?

20:25.701 --> 20:28.703
And why are you wearing a pillow?

20:28.771 --> 20:31.072
Well, those are...
that... those are great questions,

20:31.140 --> 20:33.341
and I'm gonna answer both of them later.

20:33.409 --> 20:35.810
But right now, I need
you to do something for me.

20:35.878 --> 20:37.078
What?

20:37.146 --> 20:40.215
Get me some clothes, and
don't tell Mommy that I'm here.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.983
I thought you said lying
was a bad thing.

20:42.051 --> 20:46.321
It is, it's terrible, but
this-this is different.

20:46.389 --> 20:47.689
Because we're gonna play a game.

20:47.757 --> 20:50.091
It's called "Sneak
Daddy Out of the House."

20:50.159 --> 20:51.793
That still sounds like a lie.

20:51.861 --> 20:53.128
(sighs)

20:53.195 --> 20:55.563
You know, it's complicated, Monkey.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.066
You're just gonna
have to go with it, okay?

20:58.134 --> 20:59.768
What's in it for me?

20:59.835 --> 21:01.436
What do you want?

21:01.504 --> 21:03.505
- Chocolate cake.
- Done.

21:03.572 --> 21:06.808
- For a whole year.
- Absolutely not.

21:06.876 --> 21:08.810
Mommy, I'm thirsty!

21:08.878 --> 21:10.845
Okay, fine.

21:10.913 --> 21:12.614
Done.

21:12.681 --> 21:15.617
Now will you please go
get me some clothes?

21:17.853 --> 21:23.158
(dance music
playing, low and indistinct)

21:23.225 --> 21:24.325
What the hell did you do to me?

21:24.393 --> 21:26.628
What do you mean?

21:26.695 --> 21:28.363
One second, I'm standing here,

21:28.431 --> 21:30.331
next second, I'm in my ex's bed naked.

21:30.399 --> 21:32.534
Well, you're welcome.

21:32.601 --> 21:34.202
So,

21:34.270 --> 21:35.837
did it work?

21:35.905 --> 21:36.905
You two have sex?

21:36.939 --> 21:38.139
No.

21:38.207 --> 21:41.042
Why would you think that
putting me in her bed naked

21:41.110 --> 21:42.277
would get us to have sex?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.512
- (sighs) Always works for me.
- And why would

21:44.580 --> 21:46.147
you even want Chloe and I to have sex?

21:46.215 --> 21:48.083
So that you and her will
get back together,

21:48.150 --> 21:49.550
and she'll be out of Lucifer's life.

21:49.552 --> 21:50.885
You're not from around here, are you?

21:50.953 --> 21:53.054
You have no idea.

21:53.122 --> 21:55.242
You can't just smash two
people together like Barbies,

21:55.257 --> 21:56.825
and think that that's gonna fix things.

21:56.892 --> 21:59.094
Relationships, they
take time and effort.

21:59.161 --> 22:01.596
And you got to work at it, like...

22:01.664 --> 22:03.364
it's your job.

22:03.432 --> 22:07.135
Humans are so exhausting.

22:07.203 --> 22:09.370
Here are the books you wanted to see.

22:09.438 --> 22:11.439
Oh, no, we're not through here.

22:11.507 --> 22:13.741
You assaulted a police officer.

22:14.810 --> 22:15.810
I'm taking you in.

22:15.845 --> 22:17.112
And what exactly

22:17.179 --> 22:19.681
are you going to say happened?

22:20.816 --> 22:21.816
Hmm?

22:23.519 --> 22:26.020
That a tiny female bartender

22:26.088 --> 22:27.622
knocked you out,

22:27.690 --> 22:29.257
stripped you naked

22:29.325 --> 22:31.659
and put you in your ex's bed?

All this motorcycle
riding's enlarged my prostate.

26:40.596 --> 26:42.029

26:42.097 --> 26:43.898
That's an
unfortunate occupational hazard.

26:43.966 --> 26:45.299
Tell me about it.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.534
Look, we've trademarked our name.

26:46.602 --> 26:47.835
We're selling T-shirts and jackets,

things out of people.

way to get our bad guy.

He knows exactly who robbed the docks.

27:55.270 --> 27:57.238
He's gonna need to
deal with this immediately.

27:57.305 --> 27:59.573
Or it puts his plan to
re-brand in jeopardy.

27:59.641 --> 28:00.708
Defying his orders...

28:00.776 --> 28:02.376
it's a huge challenge to his authority.

28:02.444 --> 28:04.578
He's not gonna want to deal
with this in public.

28:04.646 --> 28:06.013
Bet you the first person he goes to see

28:06.081 --> 28:07.381
is the owner of that bracelet.

28:07.449 --> 28:09.950
What, so your strategy is
just to sit here, paralyzed,

28:10.018 --> 28:12.553
hoping that Cutter leads
us to the suspect?

28:12.621 --> 28:13.854
What a terrible idea.

28:13.922 --> 28:15.423
Hmm, you think so?

28:15.490 --> 28:16.957
I do, I mean, for one,

28:17.025 --> 28:18.292
even though Cutter's no brain surgeon,

28:18.360 --> 28:19.694
surely he wouldn't just...

28:19.761 --> 28:20.861
Wouldn't what?

28:20.929 --> 28:22.663
(bike engine starts)

28:27.502 --> 28:29.136
Well done, Detective.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.504
(engine starts)

28:31.072 --> 28:32.873
(chuckles)

28:34.943 --> 28:37.044
A toast to Dr. Linda Martin,

28:37.111 --> 28:39.112
therapist to the Devil himself.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.414
(both laugh)

28:40.481 --> 28:42.749
I should put that on the door.

28:42.817 --> 28:44.985
Mm, well, it sounds like he's dealing

28:45.053 --> 28:46.286
with some genuine issues.

28:46.354 --> 28:48.789
I'm just having such a hard
time getting through to him.

28:48.856 --> 28:51.758
Maybe it's because you've
been humoring his metaphor

28:51.826 --> 28:53.193
without fully embracing it.

28:53.261 --> 28:56.029
You mean, completely accept
that he's actually the Devil?

28:56.097 --> 28:57.831
Mm-hmm.

28:57.899 --> 28:59.666
It's worth a try.

28:59.734 --> 29:02.603
If only I knew someone who
could help me with the Bible.

29:02.670 --> 29:03.904
(laughs)

29:03.972 --> 29:06.673
I know so much about it, it's
almost as if I was there.

29:08.676 --> 29:12.713
If he's positioning himself
as the Devil, right?

29:12.780 --> 29:14.514
He must see himself as evil.

29:14.582 --> 29:15.582
Mm!

29:15.583 --> 29:16.416
No.

29:16.484 --> 29:17.951
Actually, he's struggling.

29:18.019 --> 29:20.988
I think he thinks other
people see him as evil.

29:21.055 --> 29:23.857
You seem attached to this patient.

29:23.925 --> 29:25.392
I am...

29:25.460 --> 29:28.495
very motivated to help him.

29:28.563 --> 29:29.563
I see.

29:29.564 --> 29:31.198
Well, um,

29:31.266 --> 29:33.433
every culture in the world

29:33.501 --> 29:36.136
and throughout history, for that matter,

29:36.204 --> 29:38.038
has its very own myth of the Devil.

29:38.106 --> 29:39.439
Mm-hmm.

29:39.507 --> 29:41.642
But the one thing that
they all have in common

29:41.709 --> 29:45.045
is that the Devil is essentially
a rebellious son.

29:45.113 --> 29:46.280
Sounds like my guy.

29:46.347 --> 29:47.681
I thought it might.

29:47.749 --> 29:49.082
Now, if you're really serious

29:49.150 --> 29:50.630
about embracing the metaphor, Linda...

29:50.652 --> 29:53.787
truly embracing it... I
know how you can get to him.

29:53.855 --> 29:56.056
But he might not
like what you have to say.

29:56.124 --> 29:57.457
But will it help him?

29:57.525 --> 30:00.794
He may not realize it, but yes.

30:00.862 --> 30:02.062
Then let's do it.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.864
(chuckles)

30:14.723 --> 30:17.398
I've sat in a parked
car and not had sex.

30:17.465 --> 30:19.466
Ew.

30:22.137 --> 30:23.838
You can't enjoy this.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.206
This sitting around endlessly,

30:25.273 --> 30:27.775
waiting for something to happen.

30:27.843 --> 30:29.977
You know, if sitting
here not being entertained

30:30.045 --> 30:31.312
is so terrible, then maybe it's a sign

30:31.379 --> 30:32.539
you should be somewhere else.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.248
Have I done something to offend you?

30:34.316 --> 30:36.984
Only every time I see you.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.086
Ha, ha, ha. No, this is different.

30:42.157 --> 30:44.091
For the first time, I
don't think you're being

30:44.159 --> 30:45.392
honest with me. You have this

30:45.460 --> 30:46.994
mysterious container that was stolen

30:47.062 --> 30:49.096
that someone was willing to kill for.

30:49.164 --> 30:51.732
You make shady deals with shady people.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.200
You're violent.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.904
Your personal records only go
back five years, and the books

30:56.972 --> 30:58.072
from Lux are way too clean.

30:58.139 --> 30:59.373
It's...

30:59.441 --> 31:01.108
I had Dan go and check it out.

31:01.176 --> 31:03.477
You had Dan deal with Maze alone?

31:03.545 --> 31:04.745
Oh, dear. For the first time,

31:04.813 --> 31:07.248
I actually feel
sorry for Detective Douche.

31:07.315 --> 31:09.516
It all points to you being a criminal.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.986
So what's the big deal?
What if I am a criminal?

31:12.053 --> 31:13.254
I'd have to arrest you.

31:13.321 --> 31:14.622
Ooh, whip out the
cuffs, then. Why shy away

31:14.689 --> 31:16.390
from a little bondage fun? (chuckles)

31:16.458 --> 31:18.425
You know, Lucifer, this is serious.

31:18.493 --> 31:19.860
And despite all your weirdness

31:19.928 --> 31:22.129
I...

31:22.197 --> 31:24.665
I actually really like working with you.

31:29.037 --> 31:30.638
So, anyhow...

31:30.705 --> 31:31.939
What a momentous

31:32.007 --> 31:35.009
revelation, Detective
Decker. We should celebrate.

31:35.076 --> 31:36.577
You can celebrate from jail

31:51.826 --> 31:53.761

40:36.025 --> 40:37.192
Oh, I don't.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.160
I can't.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.547
Then maybe stick within the limits

40:39.562 --> 40:40.629
of your intellectual capacity.

40:40.697 --> 40:42.164
Or maybe my simplicity

40:42.231 --> 40:44.099
offers me a different perspective.

40:44.167 --> 40:45.600
God cast you out

40:45.668 --> 40:47.135
because He needed you

40:47.203 --> 40:49.638
to do the most difficult of jobs.

40:49.706 --> 40:52.507
- It was a gift.
- Gift?

40:52.575 --> 40:54.343
He shunned me.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.610
He vilified me.

40:55.678 --> 40:57.879
He made me a torturer!

40:59.949 --> 41:01.616
Can you even begin to
fathom what it was like?

41:01.684 --> 41:04.786
Eons spent

41:04.854 --> 41:06.521
providing a place for dead mortals

41:06.589 --> 41:08.457
to punish themselves?

41:08.524 --> 41:10.993
I mean, why do they blame me
for all their little failings?

41:11.060 --> 41:13.562
As if I'd spent my days sitting
on their shoulder,

41:13.629 --> 41:15.998
forcing them to commit acts they'd
otherwise find repulsive.

41:16.065 --> 41:17.265
"Oh, the Devil made me do it."

41:17.300 --> 41:20.235
I have never made any
one of them do anything.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.303
Never.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.872
What happened to you is unfair.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.639
Unfair?

41:24.707 --> 41:26.274
This is unjust.

41:26.342 --> 41:28.977
For all eternity, my
name will be invoked

41:29.045 --> 41:30.812
to represent all their depravity.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.782
That is the gift that my father gave me.

41:33.850 --> 41:34.983
It was an act of love.

41:35.051 --> 41:36.084
How do you know?

41:36.152 --> 41:38.553
Because you are his
favorite son, Samael.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.522
Do not call me that, please!

41:40.590 --> 41:42.391
You are his fallen angel.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.458
But here's the thing:

41:43.459 --> 41:44.760
When angels fall,

41:44.827 --> 41:47.262
they also... rise.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.497
All you have to do

41:48.564 --> 41:51.533
is embrace all that you are.

41:51.601 --> 41:53.435
I can't.

41:53.503 --> 41:55.103
Yes, you can.

41:55.171 --> 41:57.539
You just have to be
open to the process...

41:57.607 --> 41:59.207
You don't understand.

41:59.275 --> 42:00.942
- I can't!
- But why?

42:01.010 --> 42:03.311
Because they stole them from me!
