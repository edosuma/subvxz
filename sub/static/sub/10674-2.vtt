WEBVTT

00:00.447 --> 00:02.293
<i>Previously on</i> Underground...

00:02.387 --> 00:03.436
I ain't been more than two steps

00:03.472 --> 00:05.233
<i>off this plantation in my life.</i>

00:05.258 --> 00:05.920
(screaming)

00:05.938 --> 00:07.671
I found it...
the way to the promised land.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.717
- NOAH: <i>Tell me what this say.</i>
- MARY: <i> This is my birthday.</i>

00:09.742 --> 00:11.709
Not some campaign rally
for Daddy to be mayor.

00:11.761 --> 00:12.877
Senator, sweetie pie.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.045
CONSTABLE: This money goes
to the slave catcher

00:14.097 --> 00:15.914
- who brought her in.
- JIM: Who's that, exactly?

00:15.949 --> 00:16.965
AUGUST: That'd be me, Jim.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.132
CONSTABLE: I swear I heard her

00:18.184 --> 00:19.183
call him "Saint."

00:19.219 --> 00:20.184
She called me an angel.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.219
A man came to see me at the capital.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.937
The one that aids the runaway slaves?

00:22.973 --> 00:25.056
JOHN: <i>We can make a real difference.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:27.828
It's gonna be the slaves left
behind that gonna pay the price.

00:27.864 --> 00:29.961
That's why I don't mean
to be left behind.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.898
NOAH: <i>I been a slave all my life.</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:36.234
<i>25 years.</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:38.069
<i>That's 300 months.</i>

00:38.071 --> 00:39.988
<i>9,000 odd days of waitin'</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:44.409
<i>to die, to live, or for a miracle.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.210
But I'm done waitin'.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.379
It's time to act,
but I can't do it alone.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.082
Now, them words I found, tell me
they what I think they are.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.300
Tell me they the map to freedom.

00:52.335 --> 00:53.468
MOSES: In its own way.

00:53.503 --> 00:55.753
It's-it's a song.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.756
The map may be hidden in the words.

00:58.808 --> 01:02.310
Each verse be a code
for a signpost that lead north.

01:02.345 --> 01:03.895
- Hot damn, you was right.
- NOAH: Oh, hold up now.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.180
- What you... what you mean by "code?"
- MOSES: It speaks of

01:06.232 --> 01:07.732
followin' "the drinkin' gourd"

01:07.767 --> 01:09.767
to ascend into the...
the-the "blue haze"

01:09.769 --> 01:12.103
where you'll meet a wolf who will, uh,

01:12.105 --> 01:14.322
pull you and drag you
into the "underworld."

01:14.357 --> 01:16.024
Now, the only part
I can make sense of is...

01:16.076 --> 01:18.176
is that last verse where it speaks of

01:18.211 --> 01:19.922
crossin' the River Jordan.

01:19.974 --> 01:22.471
- I done heard some call
the Ohio River by that name. - Yeah.

01:22.496 --> 01:26.751
You go in a slave, but you come
out the other side a free man.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.789
All right, so we figure out
the rest of these verses,

01:31.841 --> 01:33.758
we one step closer to the promised land.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.959
Just 'cause we might know the way

01:35.011 --> 01:36.427
don't mean that we gonna get there.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.129
I done heard the massa say
it's over 600 miles.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.465
We gonna have to fight for every step.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.517
But I wouldn't have asked if
I didn't think we could do it.

01:42.552 --> 01:45.887
You talkin' real big,
but I ain't heard no plan yet.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.221
The plan is simple.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.140
We figure a way off of massa's land.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.112
We protect each other on the run.

01:55.899 --> 01:57.649
Then we make it so once we get north,

01:57.651 --> 02:00.118
ain't no one has no cause
to bring us back.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.741
Mm. I ain't gettin' no stripes
on my back for this.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.076
- Hey.
- What?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.744
We can't do this without you.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.162
Without any of you.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.547
Now you know we got to do this,

02:12.582 --> 02:14.415
or you wouldn't have come down.
Now I need to know now

02:14.467 --> 02:15.967
who's in and who's out.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.885
I'm in.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.985
Well, God ain't never said
we was gonna be free in heaven.

02:39.164 --> 02:40.527
Okay.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.527
(door opening)

03:02.382 --> 03:04.716
- Mr. Cato, I was just...
- Oh, let me guess.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.553
Talkin' about runnin'.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.724
NOAH: Hey, it's okay.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.525
He ain't gonna say nothin'.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.277
He comin' with us.

03:16.312 --> 03:17.862
All right, what couldn't wait?

03:17.897 --> 03:20.281
Well, massa, we just wanted
to tell you we found your wagon.

03:23.286 --> 03:27.405
It was right where this
one told us it would be.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.541
Well, I find it hard to believe
a man who would whip his own,

03:30.577 --> 03:32.076
now he wants to run with 'em!

03:32.128 --> 03:34.328
I find it hard to believe that
there's a white man in the sky

03:34.380 --> 03:36.414
with a plan for all of us,
but to each his own.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.000
He had a chance to turn
me in, and he didn't.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.586
That's right, 'cause I had
my mind set on runnin'.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.754
What you talking about, "had?"

03:42.806 --> 03:45.006

LIDDY: I don't know when it begun,

04:51.407 --> 04:52.824
but ever since I can remember,

04:52.826 --> 04:54.742
all the boys courtin' wear flowers,

04:54.794 --> 04:56.577
and all the girls wear ribbons.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.045
This one's real pretty.

04:58.081 --> 04:59.547
You ought to let me borrow it.

04:59.582 --> 05:02.166
Well, I would, but Solomon loves blue.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.551
Ooh.

05:03.586 --> 05:06.470
I bet you he asks me to dance
at Miss Shaw's tonight.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.006
(giggling)

05:10.593 --> 05:12.132
Morning.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.352
LIDDY (softly): She don't
ever go to them dances.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.521
SARAH: Think she too good for all that.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.918
(sighs)

05:52.385 --> 05:54.135
TOM: <i>When I first set foot
on this plantation,</i>

05:54.187 --> 05:56.554
<i>I swear I'd died and gone to heaven.</i>

05:56.606 --> 05:59.941
Of course, Suzanna's old man...
he made sure I knew who God was.

05:59.976 --> 06:02.560
Old Earl... God rest his soul...

06:02.612 --> 06:04.228
he could scare the moss off a rock.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.897
You ain't tellin' a lie.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.232
When Suzanna brought me home,
he near disowned her.

06:08.234 --> 06:11.102
I mean, what business did a
Northerner have to all of this?

06:11.137 --> 06:14.005
He was right. So I learned
what I could about three things.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.573
Growing cotton, managing slaves,

06:15.608 --> 06:18.643
and how to be an honorable man
of the South.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.412
The end result of the first two
is this plantation.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.414
I'm still working on the third.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.634
Now, I imagine when y'all heard
I was considering a Senate run,

06:26.669 --> 06:29.503
you had some of the same
thoughts Earl Macon did.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.339
Today, if you'll allow me,

06:31.391 --> 06:33.507
I want to start earning your trust.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.760
Well, I heard D.C. is a shit-hole, Tom.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.895
I mean, you got
a nice piece of land here.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.314
Why in God's name would
anybody want to leave it?

06:40.350 --> 06:42.650
NOAH: <i>How the hell
we gonna get off Macon land?</i>

06:42.685 --> 06:45.152
Over the mountains?

06:45.188 --> 06:47.822
Oh, yeah, it's too steep to climb.

06:47.857 --> 06:49.106
The swamp is too slow moving.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.609
Them rollers'll find us
stuck in the mud before we find

06:51.661 --> 06:52.693
a way out.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.028
That just leaves the river.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.948
That bridge is guarded day
and night by them rollers.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.200
Six of us.
Why don't we just overpower 'em?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.252
No, we can't risk a fight
while we still on Macon land.

07:01.287 --> 07:04.005
All right, we got to slip away
without no one knowin'.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.123
Get us a lead on them dogs.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.292
(grunting)

07:11.130 --> 07:13.130
Hey, can you swim?

07:13.132 --> 07:15.182
(panting)

07:15.218 --> 07:17.635
No, neither can I.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.554
What about those longboats
from Miss Mary's party?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.857
Oh, no, they was chopped up
for this morning's firewood.

07:22.892 --> 07:26.027
(both grunting)

07:26.062 --> 07:28.195
You think the blue haze
talkin' about that lake

07:28.231 --> 07:30.114
on the other side of the city?

07:30.149 --> 07:32.316
No, the thing dried up two summers ago.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.985
Could you build us a boat?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.070
What about the swamps on the other side

07:36.122 --> 07:37.455
of the Callaway plantation?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.623
No, no, no, no, no. They
much more green in there.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.575
Forget about the song.
Can you build us a boat?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.494
Fit for five without nobody noticing?

07:43.496 --> 07:45.579
Shoot, even if I could,
it don't matter much,

07:45.631 --> 07:47.048
'cause we don't know
where we runnin' to.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.666
"Wolf," "Underworld," "Angel."

07:48.718 --> 07:50.418
Don't none of that sound
like freedom to me.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.502
Sound like death.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.837
Hey, you let me worry about the song.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.130
You worry about getting
us over that river.

07:54.155 --> 07:55.196
(laughs)

07:56.092 --> 07:58.342
The bridge. Yes, sir.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.811
Already thought on that with Zeke.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.097
Ain't no way over it.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.016
No, there ain't.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.518
But I think I might be able
to fashion a way under it.

09:50.158 --> 09:52.491
- Why would he think that?
- He supposes

09:52.527 --> 09:53.846
he left the gate open last night.

09:55.985 --> 09:57.351
killed all those chickens.

09:57.403 --> 09:58.736
What are these tracks here?

09:58.771 --> 10:01.405
One's the wolf, the other's human.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.990
You keep reminding me
how Ben's growing up,

10:03.025 --> 10:04.324
but his feet ain't nearly that big.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.520
Someone else was in here.

10:06.328 --> 10:08.695
Someone who wasn't wearing shoes.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.332
May I speak frankly?

10:12.368 --> 10:14.001
No sense in asking.

10:14.036 --> 10:15.310
You've been doing it all my life.

10:16.005 --> 10:17.955
Boy's of an age onto becoming a man.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.958
Now would be a good time
for his father to be here,

10:21.010 --> 10:22.709
teach him a few things.

10:23.314 --> 10:24.595
I'm here right now.

10:24.647 --> 10:26.186
No, you ain't.

10:26.222 --> 10:28.562
You already going after them bare feet.

10:30.853 --> 10:32.853
You could use a spell
of time with your boy.

10:33.913 --> 10:35.639
That sort of solitude,

10:35.641 --> 10:38.778
manner of work... it can change a man.

10:40.946 --> 10:42.778
How many bank notices
we get while I was gone?

10:43.965 --> 10:45.282
Four.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.154
Some of that money you brought back

10:50.156 --> 10:52.072
for catching that runaway is gonna help.

10:52.124 --> 10:54.625
If we could find something
of value to sell,

10:54.660 --> 10:55.742
that would be better.

10:55.795 --> 10:57.294
Ain't nothing of value around here.

10:57.329 --> 10:59.371
There is somethin'.
You ain't gonna like it.

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
Miss Charlotte's ring.

11:02.001 --> 11:04.334
She can't wear it in the hospital.

11:04.336 --> 11:06.553
She's gonna wear it when she
comes back here to this house.

11:06.589 --> 11:09.339
And none of this talk is useful.
You want to be some help to me?

11:09.341 --> 11:11.675
You check that chicken coop again.

11:20.486 --> 11:22.853
You're heading back out so soon?

11:22.905 --> 11:24.953
(sighs) Looks like I might have to.

11:27.493 --> 11:29.792
All the eggs are gone.

11:34.783 --> 11:35.818
Ben.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.125
Yes, sir.

11:37.706 --> 11:39.155
Get your rifle. We're going hunting.

11:45.544 --> 11:48.846
NOAH: <i>Them slave catchers,
they're a relentless bunch.</i>

11:49.449 --> 11:51.265
They only focused on one thing,

11:51.300 --> 11:53.600
us.

11:53.636 --> 11:56.553
(grunts) Once Sam gets us
off this plantation,

11:56.605 --> 11:58.222
we got to protect ourselves.

11:58.274 --> 12:00.224
- That's where you come in.
- I thought that was Zeke's job.

12:00.276 --> 12:02.059
I'm talkin' real protection.

12:02.061 --> 12:03.727
The kind that would put the fear of God

12:03.779 --> 12:05.562
in any white folk that cross us.

12:07.132 --> 12:09.399
We gonna steal us a gun.

12:12.071 --> 12:15.072
How you feel about going to
that plantation dance tonight?

12:15.074 --> 12:17.791
See, Miss Shaw's late husband,
he was a collector of all manner

12:17.826 --> 12:20.744
of things. War weapons in particular.

12:20.746 --> 12:22.579
All that music, that dancin',

12:22.581 --> 12:24.298
it's gonna be the perfect distraction.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.666
But it's a two-man job.

12:25.718 --> 12:28.385
I can do it. I can get in
and out without anyone noticin'.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.003
I don't doubt it.

12:36.478 --> 12:37.761
BILL: <i>Every spot of white</i>

12:37.813 --> 12:41.064
<i>I see in this field
is a spot of failure!</i>

12:41.100 --> 12:42.900
Workday's half done now!

12:42.935 --> 12:45.202
We'll be tippin' the scale soon!

12:46.438 --> 12:48.155
I want to see ya pickin' that cotton

12:48.190 --> 12:50.107
- like you own it!
- TOM: Bill, come on over here.

12:50.961 --> 12:53.610
Gentlemen, I want
to introduce you to my overseer,

12:53.662 --> 12:55.946
Bill Meekes. He keeps productivity high.

12:55.948 --> 12:57.948
How many pounds you pulling per?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.865
Just north of 400.

13:00.202 --> 13:02.565
Shoot, I can't get mine
to pick half that much.

13:03.339 --> 13:05.743
You'll have to share your
secrets with me sometime.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.592
Well, how 'bout after dinner tonight?

13:08.627 --> 13:11.055
You'll join us for cigars
and brandy, won't you, Bill?

13:12.014 --> 13:13.463
Sure thing, boss.

13:13.515 --> 13:15.632
All right. Gentlemen.

13:17.136 --> 13:18.552
Once we get north, we're gonna need

13:18.604 --> 13:20.270
some freedom papers to stay free.

13:21.056 --> 13:22.639
That is, if you can write as well

13:22.691 --> 13:23.974
as you can read.

13:24.663 --> 13:27.477
Papers ain't gonna matter
without the massa's seal.

13:27.479 --> 13:30.814
And ain't none of us allowed
within 20 feet of the big house.

13:30.866 --> 13:33.116
I got an eye to that.
But first things first.

13:33.152 --> 13:34.785
We need to get paper and ink.

13:34.820 --> 13:37.287
- How you lookin' to manage that?
- Frog Jack.

13:37.323 --> 13:38.956
Oh, so now we gettin'
white folks involved

13:38.991 --> 13:39.990
in this mess, too?

13:39.992 --> 13:41.625
Only one color Frog Jack care about.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.484
You got your Bible from him, didn't you?

13:43.486 --> 13:45.579
You taking too many risks
with this plan of yours.

13:45.631 --> 13:48.498
- We already got the devil in our midst.
- CATO: Move, Seraphina!

13:48.500 --> 13:49.549
I want to see your hands bleed!

13:49.585 --> 13:51.335
Either your hands or your back!

13:51.337 --> 13:53.637
Ain't worth givin' someone else
a chance to turn on us.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.555
Hey. We in it now.

13:55.591 --> 13:56.890
It's all or nothin'.

13:56.925 --> 13:58.258
<i>And now that we done made the choice,</i>

13:58.310 --> 14:00.510
<i>it's high time we see it through.</i>

14:05.017 --> 14:06.472
Mr. Still.

14:07.019 --> 14:08.696
Mr. Hawkes, hello.

14:09.438 --> 14:11.438
And you must be Elizabeth.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.991
I apologize for the
unexpected welcome you received.

14:14.026 --> 14:16.276
Some time ago,
a young man named Henry Brown

14:16.328 --> 14:17.828
shipped himself from bondage.

14:17.863 --> 14:19.529
I remember.

14:19.565 --> 14:21.064
The story's infamous.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.499
Perhaps too much so.

14:22.534 --> 14:24.520
The woman in the box, sh...

14:26.205 --> 14:28.255
I know you must have questions
and I'm excited

14:28.290 --> 14:30.374
you're here to help the cause,

14:30.426 --> 14:33.702
but first I must tend to
this cargo. If you'd excuse me.

14:36.632 --> 14:39.132
MAN: ...travelin' for weeks.

14:39.184 --> 14:42.052
First by wagon, then a steamboat,

14:42.054 --> 14:43.387
last bit by rail.

14:43.389 --> 14:45.972
Three days ago, Marley,
she caught a fit.

14:46.025 --> 14:48.275
I thought the box would be bigger.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.744
And it just kept getting smaller.

14:52.398 --> 14:54.967
I could feel Marley's hot breath
on me every second.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.701
I remember wishin' not to feel it

14:57.736 --> 14:59.786
crawlin' over my skin.

14:59.822 --> 15:02.155
I ain't felt the heat no more.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.920
I just kept holdin' her.

15:05.912 --> 15:08.578
- Wasn't no room to let her go.
- (crack)

15:08.580 --> 15:09.579
(gasps) (moans)

15:15.754 --> 15:18.305
- That crate was right over here.
- Search it all.

15:18.340 --> 15:19.723
Where you hiding him?

15:19.758 --> 15:21.258
I know a runaway was brought here.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.592
Turn him over now, and I might

15:22.644 --> 15:24.594
not drag you and your pretty
wife down to the jailhouse

15:24.646 --> 15:26.263
with the rest of the nigger lovers.

15:26.315 --> 15:29.066
Look, look, look, this-this
is an illegal search.

15:29.107 --> 15:30.290
All right?
The letter of the law states...

15:30.330 --> 15:31.351
- Move.
- Hey. (grunts)

15:34.490 --> 15:37.441
Gentlemen, is there a problem?

15:37.443 --> 15:38.942
We're about to find out.

15:42.164 --> 15:44.281
(gasping)

15:47.369 --> 15:49.870
Seeing as no laws have been broken here,

15:49.922 --> 15:51.872
I kindly ask
that you and your men leave.

15:51.924 --> 15:54.277
CALLAHAN: Not before I see the papers
for every nigger in here.

16:00.048 --> 16:02.933
(panting)

16:15.314 --> 16:17.364
You got my tobacco in here, too?

16:17.399 --> 16:18.782
You ask me that every time,

16:18.817 --> 16:20.567
and every time I tell you it is.

16:20.619 --> 16:22.486
Hey, you happen to hear

16:22.488 --> 16:24.538
if they need anything else
up at the big house?

16:24.573 --> 16:26.466
I look like a house girl to you?

16:29.161 --> 16:31.281
Mr. Jack.

16:32.164 --> 16:33.797
I need a ribbon
for the plantation dance.

16:33.832 --> 16:35.323
Go on. Take your pick.

16:37.503 --> 16:40.971
But be quick. I got two
more stops to do today.

16:47.146 --> 16:49.229
(playing piano)

17:19.377 --> 17:21.595
♪ ♪

17:24.599 --> 17:27.550
SUZANNA: You see? Simple.

17:27.603 --> 17:29.686
Now you give it a try.

17:29.721 --> 17:31.805
Neigh.

17:31.857 --> 17:33.890
(humming)

17:33.892 --> 17:36.226
T.R.: Can I see him? What's his name?

17:36.278 --> 17:37.694
JAMES: Don't have one.

17:37.729 --> 17:39.062
T.R.: He has to have on

17:39.064 --> 17:40.565
(playing stiltedly)

17:40.600 --> 17:41.648
I like that.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.567
Concentrate.

17:43.619 --> 17:45.735
(continues playing stiltedly)

17:46.905 --> 17:49.906
That does not mean assault the keys.

17:49.908 --> 17:51.875
Trapped in this house all day, Mama.

17:51.910 --> 17:54.411
Even the slaves get to dance
and meet boys, and I don't.

17:54.463 --> 17:55.912
How on earth is that fair?

17:55.914 --> 17:57.998
Male attention is fleeting.

17:58.050 --> 18:01.167
And as women, we have
only our beauty and our talents

18:01.220 --> 18:02.818
in which to keep it.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.723
How 'bout we work on the latter?

18:06.758 --> 18:08.822
I swear, I'm worse off than a slave.

18:10.762 --> 18:13.430
We'll both get real horses soon.

18:13.482 --> 18:15.036
Just like my daddy's.

18:15.802 --> 18:18.268
He says I could start riding next year.

18:18.270 --> 18:21.938
T.R., honey, James will be
out working the fields soon.

18:21.990 --> 18:23.740
He certainly won't need a horse.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.111
Why don't we go see if we can
spy daddy and his friends

18:28.113 --> 18:29.446
from the porch?

18:29.448 --> 18:31.615
Come on.

18:42.044 --> 18:44.127
(sighs)

18:46.014 --> 18:48.298
Mama?

18:48.350 --> 18:51.268
You ever think about another life?

18:51.303 --> 18:54.638
- What you mean?
- (sighs) Just...

18:54.640 --> 18:58.191
these hallways, the cookhouse,

18:58.226 --> 19:00.626
the flower beds, the... quarters.

19:01.647 --> 19:05.815
They been the four corners
of my entire world.

19:07.554 --> 19:09.340
(sighs) Is there more?

19:11.190 --> 19:12.426
You know, I do.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.090
I think about all kinds of lives.

19:16.662 --> 19:19.663
Like picking my fingers bloody
out in them cotton fields.

19:19.715 --> 19:21.998
Or being put up on that block,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.501
sold away from my chillun.

19:24.503 --> 19:26.503
Maybe Deep South to a breeding farm

19:26.505 --> 19:28.471
where they force me
to have a dozen babies

19:28.507 --> 19:29.780
I never get to hold.

19:31.286 --> 19:32.780
Not like I held you.

19:34.513 --> 19:35.947
Oh, yes,

19:36.481 --> 19:39.125
I've imagined thousands
of different lives.

19:41.196 --> 19:43.269
Which is why I work as hard as I do,

19:43.322 --> 19:46.342
make sure this one here is
as easy as it can be.

20:10.382 --> 20:12.515
(wheels creaking)

20:26.948 --> 20:28.364
Whoa.

20:29.409 --> 20:31.568
What you doin', boy?

20:31.620 --> 20:34.237
I see your cart pass
through here month after month.

20:34.239 --> 20:36.873
That axle pin's
probably been bent for a while.

20:36.908 --> 20:38.408
I can fix that for you.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.410
Out of what, human kindness?

20:40.462 --> 20:41.878
Out of need for a trade.

20:41.913 --> 20:44.239
Heard you were the man to come
see if I needed somethin'.

20:48.637 --> 20:50.420
What you want?

20:50.472 --> 20:52.255
Sheets of paper and a pen.

20:52.257 --> 20:53.840
You must be joking.

20:56.728 --> 20:58.928
They catch you with that and you
gonna be tarred and feathered.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.096
And I'll be right behind you,

21:00.098 --> 21:01.431
when they find out
where you got it from.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.282
I know how to keep my mouth shut.

21:03.284 --> 21:04.504
Get out of here, boy.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.437
You probably got a few more
miles left on that wheel

21:08.490 --> 21:09.773
before it give out.

21:09.825 --> 21:11.408
Then you'll be in for a new one,
and you still got

21:11.443 --> 21:12.776
a bent axle.

21:12.778 --> 21:16.207
That is, if the accident
hadn't cracked your head open.

21:26.174 --> 21:28.258
What's got your eyes stuck on that road?

21:28.293 --> 21:30.460
Ain't nothin', Mr. Cato. Seems
like a whole lot of nothin'

21:30.512 --> 21:32.962
going on today just outside my earshot.

21:33.861 --> 21:36.382
You're thick as thieves
with that Noah, ain't you?

21:36.435 --> 21:38.184
- He look out for me sometimes.
- And you look out

21:38.220 --> 21:39.469
for him?

21:39.521 --> 21:41.387
Sometimes.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.972
See, I figure

21:43.530 --> 21:44.808
you know what he know.

21:44.810 --> 21:46.142
And I'd like to know it, too.

21:46.144 --> 21:47.777
Ain't nothin' to tell.

21:47.813 --> 21:49.646
If there was, I-I'd tell you.

21:49.648 --> 21:51.281
'Cause you with us, right?

21:52.910 --> 21:54.818
BILL: Saddle up my horse!

21:54.820 --> 21:58.121
Goddamn Frog Jack
done forgot my tobacco again!

21:58.156 --> 21:59.622
Yes, sir.

22:01.159 --> 22:03.877
Go on, boy! Get a move on!

22:03.912 --> 22:07.380
Got a problem with your ears?
You heard the boss. Hurry up!

22:07.415 --> 22:09.415
(quietly): Noah's down there
with Frog Jack, ain't he?

22:09.468 --> 22:10.717
Hmm?

22:10.752 --> 22:14.170
Aw, hell, I'll walk down!

22:15.724 --> 22:18.091
Hold up a minute, boss!

22:22.013 --> 22:24.848
I think I'm gonna go on
down there with you.

22:32.274 --> 22:33.439
(clanging)

22:33.492 --> 22:35.575
Almost done it.

22:35.610 --> 22:37.360
Boy, you best get up from under there.

22:43.034 --> 22:45.034
What the hell you doing down here?

22:45.036 --> 22:49.272
I-I came down for some hooch

22:49.307 --> 22:50.340
for the plantation dance tonight.

22:50.375 --> 22:51.841
I was fixin' his wagon in trade.

22:51.877 --> 22:53.543
- CATO: That don't seem right.
- You could've got

22:53.545 --> 22:55.628
whiskey up at the house
like everyone else.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.680
The only reason to come
all the way down here is

22:57.716 --> 22:59.583
if you was gettin' somethin'
you weren't supposed to have.

22:59.635 --> 23:01.070
Now, Bill, you know I don't sell
no contraband.

23:01.095 --> 23:03.186
I'd check him, boss, just to be sure.

23:04.389 --> 23:06.556
Strip, boy!

23:38.924 --> 23:40.506
Ain't nothin' here.

23:40.559 --> 23:42.892
Uh, with your permission, boss,
I-I'll take this one back,

23:42.928 --> 23:44.978
while you finish up
your business with Mr. Jack.

23:47.498 --> 23:48.622
Get to steppin'.

23:50.652 --> 23:52.059
Go on!

23:55.657 --> 23:58.608
Sorry for the confusion, boss.
Let me make it up to you.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.660
BILL: Never mind that.

24:00.695 --> 24:03.613
Bring me my tobacco.

24:03.665 --> 24:06.583
That sure was a close one,
huh? (chuckles)

24:06.618 --> 24:08.585
How many times you gonna make me sweat?

24:08.620 --> 24:10.119
As many times as I please.

24:10.121 --> 24:12.038
Ever since you stepped
out of the massa's office,

24:12.090 --> 24:13.790
you only doing
what I'm allowing you to do.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.455
And what is it exactly
you want me to do next?

24:15.457 --> 24:17.043
I want to know the whole plan.

24:17.095 --> 24:19.128
You'll know what you need to know,

24:19.180 --> 24:20.211
just like everyone else.

24:20.236 --> 24:21.738
Now, see, the thing is I ain't
like everyone else.

24:21.766 --> 24:23.299
I'm the man with bird in hand.

24:23.301 --> 24:24.634
Hell, five of 'em.

24:24.686 --> 24:26.636
Seems to me that make me the massa now.

24:26.688 --> 24:30.306
You swallow that, and all this
becomes a whole lot easier.

24:32.193 --> 24:34.560
You want a seat at the table?

24:34.613 --> 24:36.145
Fine. Tonight.

24:36.197 --> 24:38.231
Plantation dance at the Shaw place.

24:38.283 --> 24:39.565
We gonna steal us a gun.

24:39.618 --> 24:41.651
And how you plan on gettin'
into the big house?

24:41.653 --> 24:44.037
You ever hear how the
mistress got her nickname,

24:44.072 --> 24:46.205
"Bareback Shaw"?

24:54.061 --> 24:56.428
STILL: Some in our circle took issue
when Mr. Brown began touring,

24:56.463 --> 24:58.430
telling his story to the world.

24:58.465 --> 25:00.849
The biggest weapon
the Underground has is secrecy.

25:00.884 --> 25:04.886
I'm sure you've heard rumors of
quilts, codes, organized runs.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.355
That scene you witnessed
today is closer to reality.

25:07.391 --> 25:10.475
That slave catcher,
he knew to look for hideaways.

25:10.527 --> 25:13.111
They're getting wiser to our tricks.
We've had to adapt.

25:13.147 --> 25:15.530
Last month, they forced us out
of our proper offices.

25:15.566 --> 25:16.698
So that's how you ended up here,

25:16.733 --> 25:18.116
among the addicts and the criminals.

25:18.152 --> 25:19.284
Make no mistake,

25:19.319 --> 25:21.570
in the eyes of the law,
we are the criminals.

25:21.622 --> 25:23.655
Only thing hated more
than a runaway slave

25:23.707 --> 25:25.657
is those that would dare aid him.

25:27.244 --> 25:29.244
Do you have any children?

25:32.666 --> 25:34.749
Not yet.

25:36.339 --> 25:38.170
This is not a job for everyone.

25:38.944 --> 25:40.922
And while I would love
for you and your wife

25:40.974 --> 25:43.308
- to join our cause...
- We can't.

25:44.261 --> 25:45.844
Move the runaway.

25:47.231 --> 25:48.396
Excuse me?

25:48.432 --> 25:50.182
ELIZABETH: Those slave catchers
are out there.

25:52.436 --> 25:55.187
Look to the reflection in
the shop window on the left.

25:55.189 --> 25:57.105
They're lying in wait in the side alley.

25:57.157 --> 25:58.490
And that man across the street,

25:58.525 --> 25:59.691
he's passed by three times.

25:59.693 --> 26:01.076
He's wearing a coat and a hat,

26:01.111 --> 26:03.411
but I'm almost certain
that's that delivery man.

26:03.447 --> 26:05.664
The reward for capture
can't be worth all this.

26:05.699 --> 26:09.034
This isn't about him. It's about
arresting us for slave stealing.

26:09.086 --> 26:10.702
I's just gonna make a run for it
on my own.

26:10.704 --> 26:12.204
Hold on now.

26:12.206 --> 26:13.255
There's six of them...

26:13.290 --> 26:15.123
And if they see you run,
even if you get away,

26:15.175 --> 26:18.293
they'll have probable cause
to arrest us all.

26:20.039 --> 26:21.413
I may have an idea.

26:22.099 --> 26:23.215
AUGUST: <i>He's lost, tired, and hungry.</i>

26:23.267 --> 26:25.083
<i>He's been going a long way.</i>

26:26.436 --> 26:27.719
That don't make him less dangerous.

26:27.771 --> 26:29.520
It makes him more so.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.725
So now you got to be silent.

26:34.537 --> 26:36.249
Invisible.

26:36.780 --> 26:38.480
Weightless.

26:39.733 --> 26:43.401
All right, now go on. Sight him. Go.

26:46.123 --> 26:47.951
He's big.

26:47.953 --> 26:51.376
Don't matter how big they are,
you're in control.

26:53.797 --> 26:55.914
(click)

26:57.718 --> 27:01.553
I need you to take a <i> deep</i> breath

27:01.588 --> 27:04.089
and exhale slowly.

27:04.973 --> 27:06.925
And when you exhale,

27:07.367 --> 27:09.427
squeeze gently.

27:19.323 --> 27:21.439
(panting)

27:23.694 --> 27:25.694
What are we gonna do with him?

27:26.847 --> 27:28.913
Well, first, we...

27:32.169 --> 27:33.952
You're gonna drag him home.

27:33.954 --> 27:36.121
By myself?

27:37.007 --> 27:38.623
It's your first kill.

27:38.675 --> 27:40.625
Your responsibility.

27:42.262 --> 27:45.463
Jay will show you how to honor
the kill once you get home.

27:45.465 --> 27:48.216
(indistinct chatter)

27:48.268 --> 27:50.268
MOSES: <i>First time I laid eyes on you</i>

27:50.304 --> 27:52.304
was at one of these dances.

27:52.306 --> 27:54.105
You remember?

27:54.141 --> 27:56.191
I didn't have a pass to go,
but, Lord, it was worth

27:56.226 --> 27:59.694
that paddlin' I got just to talk to you.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.917
I's finished.

28:02.969 --> 28:04.649
No, you ain't.

28:04.701 --> 28:06.457
You got to make two more,

28:06.492 --> 28:08.045
for you and Boo.

28:09.898 --> 28:11.568
I ain't runnin' without you.

28:13.336 --> 28:16.040
It's gonna be a long, hard journey.

28:16.713 --> 28:18.797
Boo won't be able to keep
up with her little legs.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.082
That's what this for.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.250
Boo.

28:22.929 --> 28:25.253
Boo, come here, baby.
Come over here to Papa.

28:25.305 --> 28:27.722
I want you to put your arms straight up.

28:28.530 --> 28:29.708
There you go. Hold 'em up there.

28:29.743 --> 28:31.676
All right, put your arm

28:31.678 --> 28:33.345
around Papa's neck.

28:36.683 --> 28:39.734
I'll carry her all the way
to freedom if I have to.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.686
As long as we together.

28:41.738 --> 28:44.773
You, me, and her.

28:56.703 --> 28:57.982
(laughter)

28:58.007 --> 29:00.586
A nigger baby's worth $300
with his first breath.

29:00.621 --> 29:02.757
That is economic security right there.

29:02.793 --> 29:05.043
So long as we keep 'em breeding,
we don't need to fear tariffs

29:05.045 --> 29:08.216
and sanctions from the North.
What we need to worry about

29:08.252 --> 29:09.630
is Egypt and India.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.216
They're increasing output
to Great Britain.

29:11.268 --> 29:13.768
They don't have the terrain
or the labor advantages we have.

29:13.804 --> 29:15.637
Egypt near invented slavery.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.222
You sound like a Yankee.

29:17.224 --> 29:18.723
- Easy now, Schafer.
- Oh, you know as well

29:18.725 --> 29:20.325
as I do, Tom. It isn't slavery

29:20.360 --> 29:23.228
that makes cotton king. It's management.

29:23.230 --> 29:24.646
That's right.

29:24.698 --> 29:26.948
- Hear, hear.
- What are your thoughts, Bill?

29:30.397 --> 29:31.653
About what?

29:31.705 --> 29:34.873
Would the cotton industry
still thrive without slaves?

29:37.377 --> 29:40.712
I sure as hell ain't working
my hands to the bone for it.

29:41.456 --> 29:42.797
Are you?

29:46.130 --> 29:47.635
You'll have to excuse Bill.

29:47.671 --> 29:49.387
We're all defined
by the company we keep,

29:49.423 --> 29:51.172
and he spends all day outside
with the niggers.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.341
(laughter)

29:55.979 --> 29:58.096
Well, all joking aside,

29:58.445 --> 30:00.432
there's someone here
whose company I wouldn't

30:00.484 --> 30:02.084
mind sharing.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.904
She does cut a fine frame.

30:05.939 --> 30:07.856
I wouldn't know about that.

30:07.908 --> 30:10.278
SCHAFER: Aw, come on.
You're among friends.

30:10.771 --> 30:12.610
Now, we all know the
best blood in Georgia

30:12.662 --> 30:15.385
can be found on the slave blocks.

30:16.450 --> 30:19.265
What's your name, girlie?

30:20.593 --> 30:22.454
Rosalee.

30:22.456 --> 30:24.956
Rosalee.

30:24.958 --> 30:27.125
You know...

30:28.094 --> 30:31.796
...it's the hips that get me.

30:33.113 --> 30:33.715
I could watch

30:33.767 --> 30:37.469
my negra girls swishing
up and down my hallways

30:37.521 --> 30:39.687
day and night.

30:39.723 --> 30:42.941
Massa, you said you wanted your
guests to try the '22 reserve

30:42.976 --> 30:45.049
before the end of the night.

30:45.479 --> 30:46.978
Should I get it from the wine cellar?

30:48.137 --> 30:49.531
I think that's a good idea.

30:49.566 --> 30:51.533
Thank you, Ernestine.

Now, she claims
to put together these dances

34:29.393 --> 34:31.226
out of the goodness
of her Christian heart,

34:31.228 --> 34:33.862
but, uh, she's driven
by other body parts.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.897
Around this time, she always

34:35.899 --> 34:37.399
picks her stallion for the night,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.067
have one of them bodyguards come down

Now, I'm gonna be lead

in the war against the British.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.093
NOAH: <i>Oh, don't worry about that.</i>

35:05.145 --> 35:07.846

your commitment to the cause.

35:24.531 --> 35:27.115
I wouldn't touch that old hag

35:27.167 --> 35:29.584
(overlapping, excited crowd chatter)

35:29.619 --> 35:31.836

35:31.872 --> 35:33.788
Uh... no,

35:33.840 --> 35:35.623
I-I think you got the wrong person.

35:35.625 --> 35:38.626
Now that I think on it,
Miss Shaw is known

36:40.073 --> 36:43.575
(groaning)

36:43.610 --> 36:46.361
(grunting)

36:48.915 --> 36:50.198
(yelling)

36:54.538 --> 36:58.039
(yelling)

36:58.091 --> 37:00.375
(choking)

37:03.763 --> 37:05.880
(choking)

37:11.471 --> 37:13.721
(sighs)

37:13.757 --> 37:15.890
(twig snaps)

37:15.942 --> 37:17.725
(panting)

37:31.969 --> 37:34.269
Two weeks in that box.

37:34.305 --> 37:36.472
Now I feel more trapped than ever.

37:39.579 --> 37:41.913
I don't know how much longer
he can keep it together.

37:41.965 --> 37:43.414
We better do this now.

37:43.466 --> 37:46.084
I've seen my share of schemes,
Mr. Hawkes. This one is unique.

37:46.086 --> 37:47.418
Well, I see no reason

37:47.470 --> 37:49.726
why the law can't aide us
while we break it.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.807
You know what you have to do.

37:55.428 --> 37:57.562
Careful.

38:04.270 --> 38:06.904
MAN: Leave it for the morning.

38:19.786 --> 38:21.919
(panting)

38:25.258 --> 38:27.562
CALLAHAN: He's running
out the back door!

38:27.587 --> 38:28.760
MAN: Get him!

38:28.795 --> 38:30.428
(panting, grunting)

38:30.463 --> 38:32.346
JOHN: Stop!

38:32.382 --> 38:33.965
He's not resisting!

38:34.017 --> 38:36.384
Stop! You don't have to hurt him!

38:36.436 --> 38:39.437
- Stop! No! No!
- (grunting)

38:40.640 --> 38:42.723
SHERIFF: Break it up!
I said, break it up!

38:42.776 --> 38:44.776
What's this ruckus all about?

38:44.811 --> 38:45.977
CALLAHAN: This man was
helping a runaway,

38:46.029 --> 38:47.278
and I want 'em both arrested.

38:47.313 --> 38:49.147
You're the one going to jail tonight.

38:49.199 --> 38:50.815
You never heard
of the Fugitive Slave Act?

38:50.867 --> 38:52.233
Of course, but I'm not sure

38:52.285 --> 38:53.901
how it applies to assaulting free men.

38:53.953 --> 38:56.370
(groaning)

38:56.406 --> 38:59.657
(panting)

38:59.709 --> 39:01.492
Sheriff,

39:01.544 --> 39:02.994
we were attacked unprovoked.

39:02.996 --> 39:04.545
These are his papers.

39:04.581 --> 39:07.465
I want these men charged immediately.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.300
(panting)

39:09.335 --> 39:10.384
Cuff 'em.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.170
What? Wait.

39:12.172 --> 39:13.838
Charged with what?

39:13.890 --> 39:15.223
You can't handcuff me?

39:16.142 --> 39:17.175
Welcome to the Underground.

39:17.227 --> 39:18.509
CALLAHAN: Just doing my job!

39:18.561 --> 39:19.677
I got a right...

39:19.729 --> 39:21.345
(sighs)

39:21.347 --> 39:23.981
(door opens,
lively music playing, chatter)

39:24.017 --> 39:27.018
So glad you insisted
on being a part of the plan.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.070
Couldn't have pulled it off
without your talent.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.322
(grunting)

39:31.357 --> 39:34.025
(yelling)

39:36.079 --> 39:38.446
(gun clicks)

39:38.498 --> 39:39.697
(panting)

39:39.699 --> 39:40.998
Get your ass up.

39:41.034 --> 39:43.618
(panting)

39:43.670 --> 39:45.536
Get up!

39:45.538 --> 39:47.705
(panting)

39:49.042 --> 39:50.958
You ain't gonna do it.

39:51.010 --> 39:52.677
They'd string you up
by the neck, and we both dead.

39:52.712 --> 39:54.712
Lots of loud noise and confusion.

39:54.764 --> 39:56.714
Ain't nobody gonna hear.

39:56.716 --> 39:58.266
And they find a bullet in you ten yards

39:58.301 --> 39:59.851
from where you took it
to that white women?

39:59.886 --> 40:01.936
Oh, yeah, there's gonna be tons
of stories about how you died.

40:01.971 --> 40:03.721
Ain't none of 'em gonna include me.

40:03.723 --> 40:05.056
(panting)

40:05.108 --> 40:08.776
Now you're gonna stop testin' me.

40:08.811 --> 40:10.061
Fall in line.

40:10.113 --> 40:11.863
I ain't about to let you mess this up

40:11.898 --> 40:12.897
for the rest of 'em.

40:12.949 --> 40:15.066
(scoffs) Shit, boy,

40:15.068 --> 40:16.567
you've been sellin' lies so long,

40:16.619 --> 40:18.202
even you believing 'em now.

40:18.238 --> 40:21.372
You got everybody runnin'
behind you like you a saint.

40:21.407 --> 40:23.908
Noah gonna get everybody
their freedom. Nah, nah.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.410
You're just using every one
of them to get what you want.

40:26.462 --> 40:27.745
I see you.

40:27.797 --> 40:31.299
I'm gonna ask you
what I done asked the others.

40:31.334 --> 40:33.301
Is you in?

40:33.336 --> 40:35.753
(gun cocks)

40:36.673 --> 40:38.756
Or is you out?

40:38.808 --> 40:41.842
(panting)

40:51.020 --> 40:53.688
(crickets chirping)

41:12.792 --> 41:14.926
(squeaks)

41:41.821 --> 41:45.206
Someone had a good night.

41:45.241 --> 41:48.876
You are looking at a man
with a fully-funded campaign.

41:48.911 --> 41:51.963
Mm-hmm. You hear that, little one?

41:51.998 --> 41:53.414
Your daddy's going to be a senator.

41:53.466 --> 41:55.132
Mm-hmm.

41:55.168 --> 41:56.667
Oh, yeah.

41:56.669 --> 41:58.586
Did you feel that?

41:58.638 --> 42:00.671
SUZANNA: Looks like
you already got one vote.

42:00.723 --> 42:02.006
TOM: Mmm. Mmm.

42:02.008 --> 42:03.507
SUZANNA: It's good chicken, isn't it?

42:03.509 --> 42:05.843
TOM: It's good. Do it again.

42:05.845 --> 42:07.678

42:07.730 --> 42:09.230

I seen your tattoos.

43:27.260 --> 43:30.261

43:30.263 --> 43:32.758

43:34.484 --> 43:36.122
But I get it now.

43:37.687 --> 43:41.760
It's about not letting the
white folks define your story.
