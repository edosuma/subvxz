What the hell?

00:17.984 --> 00:21.249
- He's dead!
- Kelso!

00:22.322 --> 00:24.654
Open, damn it!

00:25.658 --> 00:27.853
No, they're gettin' away!

00:31.765 --> 00:33.699
What is wrong
with this thing?

00:33.767 --> 00:37.897
Well, this is against
my better judgment, but-

00:37.971 --> 00:39.905
( Clicks )

00:42.942 --> 00:46.207
Thank you.
Now Hyde's really dead.

Donna,
we have to stabilize him.

We're gonna need pudding,
and lots of it.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.137
Who chooses a chick
over a friend?

01:47.207 --> 01:49.869
Kelso, come on. Remember when
you made me walk home in a blizzard...

01:49.943 --> 01:52.275
'cause you wanted 1 0 extra minutes
to make out with Pam Macy?

01:52.345 --> 01:55.337
No, but I didn't steal
Pam Macy from you.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.907
And you could've played in
the snow until we were done.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.919
Kelso, try to look
at the facts.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.253
Jackie wanted to get married,
so you bailed...

02:05.325 --> 02:08.521
so she found someone else,
so now she doesn't wanna marry you.

02:08.595 --> 02:13.328
This solves your problem,
albeit with an unpleasant twist ending.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.526
No. I don't care.
I'm kickin' Hyde's ass.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.596
Kelso, Kelso, come on.
You couldn't open my kitchen door.

02:20.673 --> 02:23.335
I mean-

Seriously, think about
how this plan usually turns out.

My eye!

He broke the code!

You know what?
You're right.

03:35.782 --> 03:39.377
He's, like, my oldest friend,
and he stabbed me in the back.

03:48.628 --> 03:52.792
So, Kelso, how many things
around here have you put your butt on?

03:56.369 --> 03:59.202
Let's start with what
I haven't put my butt on.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.369
Oh,just a moment.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.778
Red, it's somebody
about buying the Corvette.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.509
( Grunts )

04:10.583 --> 04:16.452
Well, Marlin, we've just seen the male
of the herd grunt his displeasure.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.512
But what does it mean?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.685
- The grunting indicates aggression,Jim.
- Ah!

04:23.896 --> 04:26.228
Idiots.

04:26.299 --> 04:31.202
I am about to sell something special to me,
because we're having another baby.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.831
And to do that,
I have to believe...

04:33.906 --> 04:38.206
that this child
won't turn out a smart-ass!

04:42.582 --> 04:45.346
Hello.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.819
Yes. Don't call here again.

04:52.258 --> 04:56.058
- Well, what happened?
- The guy sounded like he was eating.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.792
I don't want some fat bastard
eating in my car.

05:04.070 --> 05:08.029
Anyway, I'm going to
the doctor's this afternoon-

05:08.107 --> 05:11.804
( Singsongy )
because I'm pregnant!

05:11.878 --> 05:15.974
Oh. Oh. And you're picking your grandparents
up from the airport.

05:16.049 --> 05:20.281
I'm going to tell them that...
( Singsongy ) I'm pregnant!

05:20.353 --> 05:23.914
They get in from Phoenix
at 5:00.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.323
You know, I was hoping when they moved
to Arizona, they'd get lost in the desert.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.359
-What's wrong with Mrs. Forman's parents?
-Nothing. They're just-

05:32.432 --> 05:37.335
They're very complicated people who
can't be summed up in a couple of words.

05:37.403 --> 05:42.466
- Grandma yells, Grandpa drinks.
- That pretty much summed it up.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.943
Now, that is not true.
My father is a wonderful man...

05:47.013 --> 05:49.675
who just gets a little sleepy.

05:49.749 --> 05:54.686
And my mother, well- fine-
is a little remote...

05:54.754 --> 05:56.949
which, I have learned
through many helpful books...

05:57.023 --> 06:00.686
makes it impossible
for her to say, ''I love you.''

06:00.760 --> 06:02.694
Even if it's the only thing
in the world...

06:02.762 --> 06:06.323
a sad little girl
needs to hear.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.799
And which is why
I say it to you every day.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.735
Eric, I love you.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.738
- ( Kisses )
- ( Chuckling )

06:13.806 --> 06:16.331
And you too, Steven.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.502
I love you!

06:18.578 --> 06:21.479
Oh, yeah. No, that's okay.
You don't have to-

06:21.547 --> 06:23.811
No, that's all right. ( Grunts )
Okay, I love you too.

06:26.586 --> 06:30.317
I can't believe that you knew Jackie and
Hyde were together and you didn't tell me.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.520
We... barely knew.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.586
Yeah, we knew,
but we were in denial...

06:37.663 --> 06:40.154
because it's
so unnatural.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.464
Like radioactive spiders.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.835
Well, that's true.

06:48.341 --> 06:51.401
I'm- It's just-
How can Hyde do this to me?

06:51.477 --> 06:54.503
- Uh-oh. It sounds like he knows.
- Finally.

06:56.282 --> 06:59.080
What, your mom knew?

06:59.152 --> 07:03.179
And Fez?
Fez never knows anything!

07:03.256 --> 07:06.657
I know. I'm really
coming into my own.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.594
Whatever.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.597
You know, none of this is
as bad as Hyde not telling me.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.225
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna make him tell me.

07:15.301 --> 07:19.237
- How are you gonna do that?
- By outwitting him conversationally.

07:24.177 --> 07:28.273
What a fine game
of cat and mouse it will be.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.842
I'm gonna go find
an eye patch.

07:35.855 --> 07:41.157
- So, what are you gonna say?
- Oh, it'll come to me in the moment.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.422
Don't you think you should
plan it out a little?

07:43.496 --> 07:47.262
Does an astronaut
plan out his missions?

07:49.769 --> 07:53.000
What happens in cat and mouse
if the cat is retarded?

07:56.676 --> 07:59.611
Oh, you just wait and see.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.207
( Clears Throat )

08:04.283 --> 08:09.653
- What's up?
- That's an interesting question, Hyde.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.781
What is up?

08:14.160 --> 08:18.494
- Well, I guess you know about me and Jackie.
- Ahh!

08:18.564 --> 08:21.294
So the battle of wits
has begun!

08:26.072 --> 08:29.508
What battle of wits? I admit it.
I've been messin' around with Jackie.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.100
I hate you!

08:32.178 --> 08:34.169
Ow! My eye!

08:45.258 --> 08:48.193
Thanks again
for the dream catchers.

08:48.261 --> 08:52.561
A blind Indian with three fingers
made those.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.533
It was quite a thing
to watch.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.535
Wow. I wonder
if him being blind...

08:57.603 --> 09:01.095
had something to do
with the losing the fingers.

09:01.173 --> 09:05.735
Actually, I think they were taken
as part of a primitive manhood ritual.

09:07.947 --> 09:11.348
Eric, I kinda like your grandparents.
What were you so worried about?

09:11.417 --> 09:16.116
- Wait for it.
- Burt, sweetie, I think that car is trying to pass.

09:16.188 --> 09:20.215
- Why don't you move over?
- Oh, he's fine.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.284
Honey, I really think
you should move over.

09:22.361 --> 09:24.352
- Sweetie, he can go around.
- ( Shouts ) Move!

09:24.430 --> 09:26.364
<i>- I'm moving.
- ( Tires Squealing )</i>

09:33.372 --> 09:37.035
And when he saw you guys kissing,
he just fell apart.

09:37.109 --> 09:41.603
I mean, it was awful.
And then he ran into the screen door.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.445
Oh, he's just so bad
at doors.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.848
Look, if you don't
work things out with Kelso...

09:48.921 --> 09:53.085
everybody's gonna choose sides,
and nobody's gonna be friends anymore.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.286
Well, that's not my fault.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.386
Look, he deserted me.
He broke my heart.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.899
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- You're dating his best friend!

10:00.967 --> 10:02.935
<i>You've gotta talk to him.</i>

10:03.002 --> 10:05.664
You owe him an explanation.

10:05.738 --> 10:09.606
( Groans ) This is so not the way
I wanted to spend the day.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.235
Well, I didn't wanna
spend the day...

10:12.311 --> 10:15.109
wiping tears and pudding
off of Kelso's cheek.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.415
Burt, honey, why don't you
come over and sit with us?

10:24.490 --> 10:26.924
I'm fine here.

10:26.993 --> 10:31.089
We'd really like it if you
would sit and join the party.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.826
- I'm part of the party right here.
- ( Shouts ) Sit!

10:41.007 --> 10:42.941
( Sighs )

10:45.478 --> 10:47.946
So, Burt, you're lookin' fit.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.016
Dry heat and central air.
That's the key.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.211
Uh-huh.

10:54.286 --> 10:57.050
I've even got
an air-conditioned garage.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.786
We can go from the house to the car
without ever feeling the heat.

11:00.860 --> 11:05.854
Wow. They literally never
have to breathe fresh air. Wow.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.923

real nice sandals, Burt.

Oh, um,

11:36.696 --> 11:39.256
- Here she is.
- Hello, Mom, Daddy.

11:39.331 --> 11:43.233
Kitty, tell everyone
your wonderful news. Quick.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.965
- I'd really rather not right now, Red.
- But that's why we're here.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.769
Yeah, for the love of God,
Mom, tell them.

11:49.842 --> 11:53.334
- No, I said not right now.
- Kitty, they came all this way.

11:53.412 --> 11:56.609
- Yeah, come on.
- Fine. You wanna hear the big news?

11:56.682 --> 11:59.242
The doctor told me
I started menopause.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.650
Kitty, language!

12:02.688 --> 12:05.953
- You're not pregnant?
- Nope. Nope.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.118
Just barren.
Talk about that.

12:24.616 --> 12:28.108
Mom, I'm really sorry.

12:28.187 --> 12:31.350
I know you wanted a baby,
but I'm not really sure what to say...

12:31.423 --> 12:36.326
mainly because I'm not
really sure what menopause is.

12:40.232 --> 12:42.427
Are you-Are you gonna,
like, lose your hair?

12:46.071 --> 12:48.062
Shut up!

12:50.409 --> 12:53.970
She's not losing anything.

12:54.046 --> 12:59.177
This just means
that from time to time-

12:59.251 --> 13:03.847
A woman's body- ( Clears Throat )
Kitty, explain it to the boy.

13:08.193 --> 13:11.185
I'm just getting
some juice.

13:11.263 --> 13:14.198
Hey, Mom, maybe you
should talk to Grandma about this.

13:14.266 --> 13:18.100
Now, that's an idea.
I mean, we're just ignoramuses.

13:18.170 --> 13:20.263
Okay, okay. Scoot.

13:22.041 --> 13:25.807
Is it- Is it
like a lady-parts thing?

13:27.546 --> 13:29.537
<i>We'll look it up

13:34.253 --> 13:36.687
Oh, those cookies
look good.

13:37.723 --> 13:41.318
Well, thanks.
Sorry I made a scene.

13:41.393 --> 13:44.590
Oh, you were just tired.

13:47.032 --> 13:49.899
No, I wasn't just tired.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.937
Mom, I'm having
a really hard time here.

13:53.005 --> 13:54.939
Did it hit you
this hard too?

13:55.007 --> 14:00.343
- Did what, dear?
- Menopause.

14:00.412 --> 14:04.280
( Chuckles )
I never had it.

14:07.052 --> 14:08.986
Mom, everybody has it.

14:09.054 --> 14:13.650
Well, I've always been
quite health conscious.

14:14.660 --> 14:17.458
I told you to eat
more vegetables.

14:17.529 --> 14:22.523
You cannot expect me to believe
that you never went through menopause.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.626
- Well, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

14:24.703 --> 14:28.264
Well, it doesn't matter,
because it's not nice to talk about.

14:28.340 --> 14:31.434
Not everything that needs
to be talked about has to be nice.

14:31.510 --> 14:34.638
Mom, why don't you ever
really talk to me?

14:35.747 --> 14:38.773
I told you
I liked your cookies!

14:38.851 --> 14:40.842
I'm gonna find your father.

14:43.822 --> 14:45.813
( Shouts )
Burt!

14:56.802 --> 14:59.270
Is she gone?

14:59.338 --> 15:02.569
You know, that woman is crazy.

15:02.641 --> 15:06.577
Your mother just doesn't know
how to talk to people.

15:07.579 --> 15:09.570
If she yells at you...

15:09.648 --> 15:12.378
she really means
that she's sorry you're upset.

15:12.451 --> 15:15.443
And if she breaks
all your golf clubs...

15:16.455 --> 15:19.083
she means
''happy anniversary.''

15:23.262 --> 15:25.856
Oh, Daddy, I love you.

15:25.931 --> 15:29.697
I love you, punkin,
and so does your mother.

<i>( Bea Shouts )

15:34.273 --> 15:36.639

- Okay.

Try to get my eye now!

15:50.722 --> 15:52.815
( Groaning )

15:52.891 --> 15:54.882
Hyde, get off!.

15:55.894 --> 15:58.158
Not until you calm down.

15:59.464 --> 16:03.059
- Ah! A wet one!
- ( Grunts )

16:03.135 --> 16:06.536

Kelso, look, man,
we need to settle this.

16:13.845 --> 16:16.712
No, I don't wanna settle this!
I don't wanna talk about it!

16:16.782 --> 16:20.309
All I wanna do is pound you
so you can feel as bad as I do!

16:24.323 --> 16:26.314
Fine. Fair enough.

16:27.626 --> 16:30.094
Go ahead and hit me.
Free shot.

16:31.163 --> 16:33.688
You gonna hit me back?

16:36.235 --> 16:39.432
No, man.
That's why they call it a free shot.

16:39.504 --> 16:41.734
Oh. Okay.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.798
Get ready.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.866
Here it comes.

16:48.914 --> 16:50.905
It's comin'.

16:52.684 --> 16:54.845
Get ready.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.911
We're ready.
Do it, fool!

17:09.501 --> 17:11.492
You know what?

17:11.569 --> 17:13.560
Forget it.

17:13.638 --> 17:15.630
It's not gonna
change anything.

17:16.942 --> 17:20.844
I just- Forget it.

17:27.685 --> 17:30.450
Look, Kelso...

17:30.522 --> 17:33.286
I didn't plan for this, but-

17:38.130 --> 17:40.257
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

17:41.466 --> 17:44.367
I'm- I'm really sorry.

17:44.436 --> 17:46.461
( Fez, Donna )
Aw!

17:48.840 --> 17:51.502
Would you get bent?

17:54.379 --> 17:58.975
-So what are we gonna do now?
-I'll tell you what you guys are gonna do.

17:59.051 --> 18:03.317
( Clears Throat ) You two are gonna shake
hands, and you're gonna be done with it.

18:03.388 --> 18:05.219
No.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.417
Come on.
Give it a try.

18:07.492 --> 18:09.983
Shake hands.

18:10.062 --> 18:12.189
- I don't wanna.
- ( Shouts ) Shake!

18:20.405 --> 18:24.239
- ( Sighs )
- Well, well. Look who it is.

18:24.309 --> 18:26.743
Uh, look, Michael,
I'm glad I found you.

18:27.813 --> 18:31.977
- How's your eye?
- What do you care?

18:32.050 --> 18:35.315
Okay. Look, Michael,
I know we should've told you sooner...

18:35.387 --> 18:37.912
but I'm not
gonna say I'm sorry...

18:37.989 --> 18:41.254
because I wanted you,
and you left and broke my heart.

18:41.326 --> 18:43.260
And I like Steven now...

18:43.328 --> 18:45.990
so you need to get over it
so we can all become friends again.

18:47.933 --> 18:49.924
Apology accepted.

18:52.704 --> 18:55.969
( Scoffs )
Here, let me help you.

18:57.776 --> 19:02.110
- Ow. My eye.
- Yeah.

19:06.151 --> 19:08.142
Hey.

19:10.489 --> 19:14.152
- How you doin'?
- Oh, great.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.820
It's so nice to no longer
be a woman.

19:18.964 --> 19:21.398
Kitty, that's not true.

19:23.602 --> 19:27.368
You know, I've been tryin'
to think what I could do to-

19:27.439 --> 19:31.535
to make you feel better,
and I finally came up with something.

19:32.544 --> 19:35.104
I sent your parents
home early.

19:43.054 --> 19:45.045
That kinda helps.

19:46.925 --> 19:50.918
I just-
I really wanted to be pregnant.

19:53.598 --> 19:55.759
You know what
the real kicker is?

19:57.102 --> 20:00.003
This morning, when we thought
you were still pregnant...

20:01.907 --> 20:03.898
I sold my Corvette.

20:08.547 --> 20:10.538
( Laughing )

20:23.261 --> 20:25.456
Memorial Day, meningitis-

20:25.530 --> 20:27.521
Okay, here we go.
Menopause.

20:30.335 --> 20:33.668
Good God! I didn't think
they'd have pictures.

20:37.876 --> 20:42.006
Well, at least they use
the word ''uterus'' a lot.

20:44.416 --> 20:46.475
I could've gone
a whole lifetime...

20:46.551 --> 20:49.418
without knowing they had
a mucus membrane.

20:57.929 --> 21:00.727
Well, you just-

21:00.799 --> 21:03.427
You can't unlearn something
like that, you know?

21:03.502 --> 21:05.436
Oh, no.
Look at the symptoms.

21:05.504 --> 21:09.201
''Temperamental behavior,
mood swings, facial hair.''

21:11.510 --> 21:15.173
Uh-oh. Dad, I think
you have menopause.

21:28.226 --> 21:30.217
Hey, Eric,
can you hand me a cookie?

21:30.295 --> 21:33.321
No, I can't reach
while I'm driving.

21:33.398 --> 21:36.333
- Come on. Please? Just one cookie.
-Just wait till I stop.

21:36.401 --> 21:38.392
( Shouts )
Cookie!

21:42.307 --> 21:45.504
You know, Donna,
you catch more flies with sugar.

21:46.878 --> 21:48.869
Right, Burt?

21:51.716 --> 21:53.946
( Snoring )

21:54.305 --> 22:00.604
