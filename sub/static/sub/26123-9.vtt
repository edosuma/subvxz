So, tell me, Admiral.

38:55.900 --> 38:59.370
What's going through your head
on the night before D-Day?

39:01.372 --> 39:02.874
Nathan James.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.642
The ship?

39:04.642 --> 39:08.112
The sailor.
Ship's namesake.

39:08.112 --> 39:12.183
Captain Nathan James
skippered a PT boat

39:12.183 --> 39:14.352
during the war
in the Pacific.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.155
His fleet was decimated.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.557
His boat was all
that was left standing

39:19.557 --> 39:21.793
against nine
Japanese destroyers.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.929
The boat sank beneath him.

39:24.929 --> 39:29.534
Not before he stopped
the enemy's advance.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.402
He single-handedly saved

39:31.402 --> 39:34.138
a fleet of newly repaired
American destroyers

39:34.138 --> 39:36.274
coming out of Pearl Harbor

39:36.274 --> 39:39.844
carrying thousands of sailors
into the fight.

39:39.844 --> 39:44.949
Captain James said,
"War is a beast.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.019
It appears in many forms.

39:48.019 --> 39:51.623
Sometimes it's the beast
you face head on,

39:51.623 --> 39:56.494
out on
the field of battle.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.263
As equals.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.632
Sometimes
the beast hides out.

40:00.632 --> 40:05.770
Lurking somewhere in the deep,
biding its time

40:05.770 --> 40:11.376
until, when your guard is
dropped, it comes for you."

40:12.877 --> 40:15.747
"Bloodthirsty and merciless."

40:19.917 --> 40:22.153
"And it drags you under.

40:22.153 --> 40:27.025
On any given day, you never know
which beast you're gonna face."

40:28.993 --> 40:31.062
Which beast is it for you,
Admiral?

40:31.062 --> 40:33.097
Man: All aboard!

40:33.097 --> 40:35.300
Man #2: I knew the Marines
could do almost anything,

40:35.300 --> 40:37.902
but I never knew they could do
anything like this.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.404
You've got no idea.
