00:55.848 --> 00:58.726
Can I see your license
and papers, please?

00:58.768 --> 01:01.061
Sir, no problem.

01:10.488 --> 01:11.489
Here we go.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.120
Your license?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.957
-(radio beeps)
-Officer Moreau...

01:21.999 --> 01:23.334
Come in, over.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.668
Stand by.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.170
I'm 10-6.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.630
Over.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.465
Be advised it's 10-18 over.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.551
Stay in your vehicle.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.170
Watch your speed.

02:08.212 --> 02:11.507
The roads are icy.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.554
Have a nice day, sir.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.796
Keep local police off this road
from here to the border.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.172
Yes, Captain.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.117
Careful!

06:24.384 --> 06:26.053
Peace be with you.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.307
You've returned
from your travels?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.726
Yes, I came back.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.070
Is there someplace
we can speak in private?

06:43.112 --> 06:45.030
Follow.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.861
Are you hungry?

10:52.903 --> 10:55.947
She's not a bad cook
for a Yazidi.

11:02.704 --> 11:06.666
Speaking of women,
how is your wife?

11:06.708 --> 11:10.212
I've heard many things...

11:10.253 --> 11:12.464
that your wife left you...

11:12.506 --> 11:15.175
and that your brother
is missing.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.220
Would you like to know
what else I've heard?

11:19.971 --> 11:22.099
That you've been "recruiting"
a militia.

11:22.140 --> 11:28.146
And that you've enlisted Shia,
Sahani, and Salafis to join you.

11:28.188 --> 11:33.318
Do you fight along side
apostates now?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.697
I won't let you do this.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.370
I'm not asking your permission.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.833
I'm the leader.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.795
I give the orders here,
and you follow.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.923
Yes.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.800
But that was in the past.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.734
I'm buying something
with my money.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.742
Nagib!

13:31.019 --> 13:33.772
Did you think this was for you?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.483
I've heard that your men...

13:36.525 --> 13:40.612
haven't been paid in months.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.536
So I told myself,
I have to come here...

13:47.577 --> 13:50.288
to fix this.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.504
You think you can buy
my men's loyalty...

13:57.546 --> 13:59.047
with money?

13:59.089 --> 14:00.799
You must be joking.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.345
The only joke here is you.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.597
Take their weapons away.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.040
Don't worry.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.002
I have something for you
as well.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.548
Ibrahim.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.628
Cluzet, we're stopping for fuel.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.296
Check out the ski resort.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.256
We'll catch up.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.280
Traitors!

16:41.876 --> 16:44.421
My brothers in God:

16:44.462 --> 16:46.589
Our prophet...

16:46.631 --> 16:49.634
was honest and humble.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.679
He set a good example for us.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.597
But this man...

16:57.434 --> 17:01.730
he was never a good example
for you.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.567
He enjoyed the lavishes
of life...

17:05.608 --> 17:08.820
and never cared
for your interests.

17:08.862 --> 17:13.366
Instead of being
a good shepherd...

17:13.408 --> 17:16.578
he acted like a wolf.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.633
You'll regret it!

17:42.979 --> 17:44.606
Take him.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.737
Put him with the Westerners.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.873
My brothers in God:

18:01.915 --> 18:06.878
I promise you...

18:06.920 --> 18:11.591
we have to be united...

18:11.633 --> 18:15.053
to defeat the enemy...

18:15.094 --> 18:18.306
and get back our land.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.976
So if you give me your trust...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.312
I swear to you that...

18:24.354 --> 18:29.067
we'll all be living
under the faith of Islam.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.736
All of us.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.113
Together!

18:38.701 --> 18:41.746
We'll create the greatest
Islamic empire!

19:31.379 --> 19:33.089
Is he going to die?

19:33.131 --> 19:37.010
Sorry. I don't know.

19:40.638 --> 19:45.184
Do you know
what he wants with us?

19:47.103 --> 19:48.146
Samir!

19:50.064 --> 19:51.858
What are you doing here?

19:51.900 --> 19:52.859
Go back to your room.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.162
Drop your weapon!

38:47.200 --> 38:51.455
We gather to celebrate
the life of Father Joseph.

38:53.165 --> 38:56.626
Looking at the many faces
before me...

38:56.668 --> 39:03.508
it's easy to see the vast impact
one man can have on the world.

39:03.550 --> 39:08.221
The life of Father Joseph
was an example of devotion...

39:09.598 --> 39:11.058
and sacrifice...

39:11.099 --> 39:13.143
and selflessness.

39:14.478 --> 39:17.355
Truly, an example to us all.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.317
Let us pray...

39:20.358 --> 39:25.072
for his soul to rest
in eternal peace.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.332
Our Father who art in heaven...
