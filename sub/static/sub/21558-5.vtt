-[Jessica grunting]
-Who's this?

01:52.945 --> 01:55.157
[all grunting]

01:58.451 --> 02:00.912
-She's annoying.
-[grunts] Tell me about it.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.581
[grunting continues]

02:23.601 --> 02:24.811
Where's Alexandra?

02:26.854 --> 02:27.814
[grunts]

02:32.277 --> 02:34.196
-Get down!
-[rapid gunfire]

02:41.369 --> 02:43.580
[grunts] Dude, get off me.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.633
-[Jessica grunts]
-Now it's a goddamn party.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.468
-Who are these people?
-[Stick] They want Danny.

03:05.142 --> 03:06.603
We want him alive.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.902
[softly] Oh, shit.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.208
We work together,
we walk out of here alive.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.297
[both grunting]

03:34.381 --> 03:36.341
-No!
-[Matt grunts]

03:36.424 --> 03:38.009
[all grunting]

03:41.554 --> 03:42.764
Wait, I just wanna talk to you.

03:55.192 --> 03:58.988
-Where's Matt? What's he thinking?
-He's not. Stay with me!

04:01.491 --> 04:03.034
[Hand operative groans]

04:05.036 --> 04:06.203
[Matt groans]

04:06.288 --> 04:07.580
This is not who you are.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.751
I know you.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.838
[both grunting]

04:20.760 --> 04:21.761
[Luke groans]

04:21.844 --> 04:22.929
[groans]

04:24.389 --> 04:25.807
-[Elektra grunts]
-You died.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.891
[grunts]

04:27.684 --> 04:29.519
I held you in my arms. [grunts]

[groans]

04:35.650 --> 04:36.776
[grunts]

04:39.696 --> 04:41.072
[groans] I buried you, Elektra!

04:46.869 --> 04:47.870
Elektra.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.249
That's your name.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.295
Elektra.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.433
What have they done to you?

05:11.728 --> 05:12.729
[in Japanese] What are you doing?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.188
-I can help you, Elektra!
-[yells]

05:14.981 --> 05:15.982
[groans]

05:23.030 --> 05:24.574
They say you can't be broken.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.743
We'll see about that.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.204
[both grunting]

05:38.463 --> 05:39.797
[Luke groans]

05:39.881 --> 05:40.882
Luke!

[all grunting]

05:56.230 --> 05:58.107
[groans]

06:00.067 --> 06:01.903
-[coughs]
-Get him, now.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.407
[panting]

06:10.369 --> 06:12.497
[all grunting]

06:19.671 --> 06:20.672
[Stick] Let's go, kid.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.842
-[Danny] Where's Luke?
-[Jessica] They took him.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.929
-[Stick] More comin'.
-[Jessica] Not for long.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.682
-[grunts]
-Hey! Let's go.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.184
Get over here, guys!

06:37.313 --> 06:40.399
[all straining]

06:40.483 --> 06:41.943
Smells like shit.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.529
It's our only way out.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.205
[grunts]

07:02.338 --> 07:03.715
-[grunts]
-[bones crack]

07:05.550 --> 07:08.595
Where did they go?
And where's the Black Sky?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.723
[in Japanese]
That's a question for our leader.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.987
[grunting]

07:32.118 --> 07:33.953
[panting heavily]

07:34.036 --> 07:35.079
Danny!

07:35.747 --> 07:37.957
-Man, am I glad to see you.
-Where've you been?

07:38.040 --> 07:40.502
I'll explain everything, but first...
we have company.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.294
Company? Hey! Whoa!

07:43.420 --> 07:44.839
I said I'd bring him back.

07:45.422 --> 07:46.883
[Colleen] What happened?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.135
[Danny] The Hand attacked us.
They took Luke.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.054
[Colleen] How do you know
they didn't follow you here?

07:53.430 --> 07:55.099
[panting] We're clear.

07:56.433 --> 08:00.146
-What?
-No place we land will stay safe for long.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.690
-We can't keep running forever.
-I'm not running, period.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.692
[Danny] My company owns a building
not far from here.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.695
We don't need another hideout.
We just need for this to be over.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.405
-You're oversimplifying it.
-[Jessica] Oh, am I?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.241
Or am I the only one of us
who isn't in this for a cheap thrill?

08:12.324 --> 08:15.077
-Jessica.
-And the last time we did have a plan,

08:15.161 --> 08:18.039
but this one left us to go
fight that chick in the spandex.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.999
Yeah. Just like he did in Midland Circle.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.793
-I made a mistake.
-[door opens]

08:25.547 --> 08:28.049
[footsteps approaching]

08:33.513 --> 08:34.514
Luke?

08:35.973 --> 08:37.725
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

08:38.309 --> 08:39.393
I'm fine.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.357
Actually, I'm, uh... I'm better than fine.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.324
I got one of theirs.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.453
[theme music playing]

10:24.749 --> 10:25.750
[grunts]

10:28.210 --> 10:29.211
[chuckles]

10:30.337 --> 10:32.048
You're skilled, my child.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.301
It's clear, watching you fight,

10:35.384 --> 10:38.638
that you know much more
than anyone can learn in a single life.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.685
That's a compliment.

10:45.477 --> 10:47.271
They've said the same thing about me.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.567
You've trained me well.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.451
I had a daughter once.

11:01.618 --> 11:03.663
This was in my first life.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.793
Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun.

11:09.877 --> 11:14.924
Before I learned of the substance.
And before I started the organization.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.261
And she was intelligent, kind...

11:21.889 --> 11:26.268
And death took her from me
before I learned how to defeat it.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.942
In my grief, people told me
that she was too good for this world.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.151
I didn't believe them.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.155
But there was some truth
in what they said.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.075
She wasn't a warrior.

11:42.659 --> 11:44.245
She wasn't like you and me.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.288
[sighs]

11:46.372 --> 11:47.749
And now I know...

11:48.958 --> 11:50.877
I was never meant to raise her.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.088
I was meant to raise the Black Sky.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.467
I'm grateful for you.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.637
[sighs]

12:01.720 --> 12:04.390
You had no choice in returning from death.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.682
I realize that.

12:07.059 --> 12:12.481
But I hope you understand that this
is the life you were chosen to lead,

12:12.564 --> 12:15.234
as a weapon against our enemies.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.327
If you do not fulfill that role...

12:27.163 --> 12:29.248
you're of no use to the Hand.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.167
Or to me.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.006
Of course not.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.145
[in Japanese] I have news.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.772
Sowande has been taken.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.316
[in English] By whom?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.902
[in Japanese] We can only assume
it was the Iron Fist and his allies.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.362
[in English] Over the years,

13:00.446 --> 13:03.657
the five of us have escaped every manner
of danger and death.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.284
He will find his way back to us.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.953
[takes deep breath] In the meantime,

13:07.036 --> 13:10.915
tell the others that our reinforcement
from South America will be arriving soon.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.252
And together, we will expand
our search for the Iron Fist.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.546
[in Japanese] I will.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.594
There is something else we must discuss.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.515
[Alexandra in Japanese] Later.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.601
As you wish.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.998
[Danny] How long do you think
he'll be out?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.916
-[Jessica] Not much longer.
-[Danny] How do you know?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.209
[Jessica] Because this is happening.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.921
[chuckles softly]

13:59.964 --> 14:01.673
What are you doing in New York?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.551
There's nothing you can do
to make me betray my own.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.012
I'm up for the challenge.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.140
Don't bother.
The fingers were cast out of K'un-Lun.

14:09.223 --> 14:13.060
Which means he trained
with the same monks that raised him.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.522
-[Luke] So?
-[Danny] Put us through brutal trials.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.190
It's called discipline.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.733
It means he won't crack.

14:20.817 --> 14:21.861
Not by force.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.571
[Sowande] You know nothing
of the power of the Hand.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.616
You are mice who fell into a well.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.036
Believe me, this will drown you.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.413
What do you want with our city?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.831
[scoffs] Your city?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.628
This place belongs to the Hand.
It always has.

14:39.711 --> 14:43.007
-What do you mean, "always"?
-I traced it back to 1820.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.177
-[Sowande] That's all?
-Why do you want Danny Rand?

14:46.260 --> 14:50.347
Nothing you can do can make me serve you.
Do you understand?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.017
Do I understand?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.020
You are the dumbest Iron Fist yet.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.233
Tell me what you want with me.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.527
We want the Fist.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.071
You are nothing.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.865
Danny Rand failed an entire city.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.368
The place he was sworn to protect.

15:12.161 --> 15:16.290
The same way the unbreakable one
let that boy die in a jail cell.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.584
Afraid and alone.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.754
The same way the woman
couldn't save the architect.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.968
What's wrong? Have I gotten in your head
the same way he did long ago?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.844
-[Luke softly] Hey, hey, hey.
-[grunts]

15:30.512 --> 15:32.264
What about the ones you still love?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.101
What will become of them
once you are gone?

15:35.184 --> 15:38.562
-Who else must die because of you?
-What are you talking about?

15:39.105 --> 15:42.233
[Sowande] The nurse.
The woman on the radio.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.360
They'll come for them next.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.030
How many mice must drown with you?

15:48.614 --> 15:49.781
-[grunts]
-[groans]

15:51.242 --> 15:52.576
[Jessica] He talked too much.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.335
[door opens and closes]

16:02.253 --> 16:05.589
-Claire, I need you to get dressed.
-What's going on?

16:06.215 --> 16:09.301
-Is your mom still here?
-No, she's in Jersey with my tÃ­a.

16:09.926 --> 16:11.428
Okay. We need to go now.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.639
Danny and Colleen are downstairs
keeping an eye out for us.

16:13.722 --> 16:14.765
Keeping an eye out?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.517
I'll explain everything in the car.

16:17.684 --> 16:19.186
You took the fight to the Hand.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.273
It went well at first,
but now we're all in danger.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.277
[sighs] I hate being right all the time.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.445
It'll only be for a couple days.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.822
So, are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

16:31.823 --> 16:34.368
At this point,
the less you know, the better.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.496
[chuckles] Are you sure about that?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.291
A couple days ago, I'm the one
who introduced you to Danny Rand.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.334
Yeah, and you also
told me to focus on myself.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.672
Part of me wishes I had listened.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.052
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

16:52.803 --> 16:54.138
All of it.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.934
I never meant to make
my trouble your trouble.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.355
Pretty sure your trouble
is my trouble now.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.249
The old blind guy kept saying that...

17:23.292 --> 17:26.712
he needed to get to you
before they did. [sighs]

17:28.339 --> 17:31.300
[Danny sighs] It's because the Hand
doesn't wanna kill me.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.260
They want me alive.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.388
He tell you why?

17:37.889 --> 17:38.890
No.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.811
To be honest,
I don't think he knows, either.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.064
Then why are you listening to him?

17:46.815 --> 17:49.610
-[scoffs]
-What do you mean?

17:49.693 --> 17:51.903
Why are you listening
to any of them, Danny?

17:52.488 --> 17:54.865
When I said that we should find others,
I did not mean...

17:57.033 --> 18:00.412
This is not their fight, it's ours,
and keeping them around is a liability.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.666
You haven't really seen what they can do.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.505
-That's not the point.
-[Danny sighs]

18:10.672 --> 18:11.673
Hey.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.098
Quick.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.380
[both grunting]

18:52.047 --> 18:53.424
[bone cracks]

18:55.967 --> 18:57.178
[all grunting]

19:25.247 --> 19:26.623
[loud thud in distance]

19:30.126 --> 19:31.462
[Bakuto] Hello, Colleen.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.549
Sensei.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.676
[Bakuto] You look well.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.806
You're supposed to be dead.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.685
I tried death. It didn't take.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.854
Stand down.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.566
She's an old friend.

19:53.149 --> 19:56.069
We are far from friends.

19:56.152 --> 19:57.571
I wouldn't say that.

19:59.155 --> 20:00.991
[Colleen grunting]

20:02.033 --> 20:04.119
When you're done with that,
I'd like to talk.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.622
There's nothing left to talk about.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.582
[grunting]

20:11.793 --> 20:14.671
It feels as if fate has brought us
back together, doesn't it?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.341
What do you want with Danny?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.343
They sent me for him, yes.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.512
But I came for you.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.349
[scoffs] Bullshit. You told me
I wasn't good enough for the Hand.

20:25.932 --> 20:28.227
It was a strategy.
To bring out your anger.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.103
To cause you to make a mistake.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.024
We have a second chance
to finish what we started.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.067
[panting] Brainwashing me?

20:38.820 --> 20:39.946
Brainwashing?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.242
You flourished under my training.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.786
Became the fighter you were meant to be.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.122
The fighter you wanted me to be.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.543
The one you needed

20:52.626 --> 20:55.296
for whatever horrible shit
you're trying to get away with.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.214
Join me, Colleen.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.802
This time I'll tell you everything.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.931
I anticipated this reunion.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.223
I didn't.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.225
[grunting]

21:10.143 --> 21:11.144
[groans]

21:12.438 --> 21:16.775
[panting] I'll never stop.
You took my life from me.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.612
No, I haven't, Colleen. Not yet.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.614
[both grunting]

21:26.493 --> 21:28.287
[gasping]

21:28.370 --> 21:30.163
I wish it could end another way.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.008
That dude was for sure dead
last time we saw him, right?

21:42.092 --> 21:43.760
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay, just checking.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.515
Remember the last time
we faced off, Bakuto?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.436
I do, Mr. Rand.
And I look forward to doing it again.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.895
You really shouldn't.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.107
I heard you'd made some friends.

21:57.691 --> 22:01.487
Smart move, considering
she never believed in her purpose,

22:01.570 --> 22:03.614
and you've yet to discover yours.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.574
Soon, Iron Fist.

22:05.657 --> 22:10.203
You'll learn your destiny is much more
than what they told you in K'un-Lun.

22:10.286 --> 22:11.204
[groaning]

22:14.875 --> 22:16.918
[Claire] We need to get her someplace now.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.947
-Hi.
-Hey.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.950
It's after midnight.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.577
Yeah.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.790
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.753
[chuckles] I'm gonna need
a little more than that.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.714
[sighs] It's the Hand.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.138
They came for you before, Karen.
I can't let that happen again.

23:10.221 --> 23:11.222
[scoffs]

23:12.057 --> 23:13.391
I don't believe this.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.645
-I know. They're back in New York, and I--
-No, no, it's not them.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.565
You. [scoffs]

23:23.068 --> 23:25.070
This is how you tell me
that you're doing it again?

23:25.153 --> 23:27.656
'Cause that's what you're saying.
You're going out as him.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.158
Uh, no, actually.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.661
Uh, well... not yet.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.621
All right, but you told me
you didn't miss it--

23:34.705 --> 23:37.082
I know what I said.
We don't have to have this conversation.

23:37.165 --> 23:40.752
Just talk to me. Please, Matt.
Just... just tell me.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.420
[both sigh]

23:44.465 --> 23:45.882
I'm doing it again.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.219
Because if I don't, people will die.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.429
Whatever the Hand is up to...

23:52.473 --> 23:55.767
New York is in its crosshairs.
I have to do this.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.607
I know.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.401
But I don't.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.988
I don't need your protection, Matt.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.115
Whatever it is you're doing,
or Daredevil is doing,

24:10.198 --> 24:11.658
I'm not a part of it anymore. So...

24:12.450 --> 24:14.495
That may be the case, yeah.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.830
[chuckles] Unfortunately,
it doesn't matter

24:16.913 --> 24:18.540
if you're a part
of Daredevil's world or not,

24:18.624 --> 24:20.626
because they may be
coming after Matt Murdock's, too.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.754
I'm sorry, does that mean
they know who you are?

24:23.837 --> 24:26.381
-Just can't take any chances.
-Matt, that isn't your call.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.426
Can you please just come with me?
Just lay low, a couple days.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.263
That's all I'm asking. I'm sorry.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.306
[sighs]

24:39.853 --> 24:40.854
Okay.

24:41.647 --> 24:42.648
Thank you.

24:43.314 --> 24:44.525
Yeah, well, don't.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.027
I'm not doing this for you. It's just...

24:48.612 --> 24:50.488
[sighs] self-preservation at this point.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.499
[sighs]

25:02.751 --> 25:04.002
You deserve better, Karen.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.173
So do you.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.144
[Misty] Office pool.
I'm putting in, like, $10.

25:21.227 --> 25:22.270
[man] I'm going for...

25:22.353 --> 25:24.522
[both continue speaking indistinctly]

25:24.606 --> 25:26.733
-Misty.
-Luke.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.068
I need your help.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.153
Okay.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.240
What's going on?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.705
You know those people you were after?
The ones that killed Cole?

25:39.788 --> 25:42.290
-Yeah.
-They're not stopping anytime soon.

25:42.373 --> 25:45.043
-Well, what do you know?
-It's... [sighs]

25:45.126 --> 25:47.713
It's complicated,
but they're very dangerous.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.717
Any chance that four-star shit-show
at the Chinese restaurant was your fault?

25:53.468 --> 25:56.096
What have you gotten yourself into, Luke?

25:56.847 --> 25:58.181
Just tell me.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.644
I've got the full resources of the NYPD.
I might know something.

26:02.728 --> 26:06.231
-Hell, we might even be on the same side.
-You know we're on the same side.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.944
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you anyway.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.822
Then I don't know how I can help you.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.782
[Danny] You got a chair?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.161
[Misty] What the hell?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.372
We've got more coming.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.626
Please. Trust me.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.754
-[Colleen groans]
-Okay?

26:28.837 --> 26:29.838
[Colleen] Yeah.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.558
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.728
Me, too.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.524
Guess it won't be today.

26:53.444 --> 26:55.656
That army you used to fight alongside...

26:56.657 --> 26:57.783
The Chaste.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.036
They captured me once.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.832
This was years ago.
Long before you were born.

27:09.419 --> 27:13.006
I had been captive three days
when they heard my soldiers approach.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.134
The fortress fell silent.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.094
The gates remained locked.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.471
[chuckles] The Chaste
couldn't comprehend it.

27:20.555 --> 27:24.976
But the soldiers outside,
they were following my orders.

27:25.060 --> 27:28.730
They sealed the gates,
allowed no one in or out.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.443
On the third day,
your soldiers turned on each other.

27:34.194 --> 27:38.198
By the fourth, they'd run out of water.
By the sixth, no food.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.874
I believe it was the tenth day
that they knelt before me.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.295
Begging to make it stop.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.215
Well...

27:57.550 --> 28:03.264
if I kneel before you right now,
shithead, will you shut up?

28:07.894 --> 28:10.605
It won't be long before
your plan comes apart.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.735
Before this chair I'm in becomes a throne.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.696
[rapid knocking on door]

28:26.830 --> 28:28.790
-We're getting everyone safe.
-Good.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.921
-He give you anything yet?
-[scoffs] What do you think?

28:35.005 --> 28:36.006
[sniffs]

28:36.089 --> 28:37.883
If she's as sweet as she smells,

28:37.966 --> 28:40.761
-I get why you're tore up about this one.
-Don't bring her into this.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.639
All these years, this is what
I've been protecting you from.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.350
-Your two worlds colliding.
-[chuckles]

28:48.226 --> 28:50.520
If you had it your way,
this is what my life would be.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.523
Now you're trying to spin it
like you're protecting me.

28:53.606 --> 28:56.276
-Maybe I got soft in my old age.
-Doubt it.

28:56.943 --> 29:01.281
Or maybe I know what I need
on the front lines.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.952
'Cause the Iron Fist
can't lead 'em like you can.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.748
[chuckles]

29:10.915 --> 29:12.459
I don't wanna lead anyone, Stick.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.837
For a man who believes in God,
you sure like denying

29:15.920 --> 29:18.840
-He has a plan for you.
-Don't use my faith against me.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.466
And what about this city?

29:21.092 --> 29:23.136
The place you can't live without.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.931
The place that made you
what you really are.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.271
-Where are you going?
-Don't...

29:33.354 --> 29:36.817
You don't get to tell me who I am,
all right? Trust me, I know.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.324
[indistinct chatter]

29:44.407 --> 29:47.327
I guess what I'm saying
is I see a future for Trish Talk

29:47.410 --> 29:50.413
that dives into some more
investigative reporting.

29:50.496 --> 29:52.999
This tremor stuff, for example,
I don't know if you guys know,

29:53.083 --> 29:54.876
-but a lot of our listeners are having a--
-[Jessica] Trish.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.211
-[panting]
-Jess?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.838
-I need her for a minute.
-What?

29:57.921 --> 30:01.382
-Come on, we gotta go. Meeting's over.
-Excuse me for one second.

30:02.758 --> 30:04.219
-Are you okay?
-No.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.387
You know that case I took?
The architect? The C-4?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.639
Well, it went south fast,
and you may be in danger.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.392
Me? It doesn't matter.
I can't just leave those people.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.145
They are safer far away from us.
Trust me.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.982
I know it's annoying,
but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.066
Shit.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.153
Stairwell. Go.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.045
Jesus! When I said I thought
you should get back to work,

30:39.129 --> 30:40.380
-I didn't mean you should go--
-[grunts]

30:40.463 --> 30:41.840
Jess! Jess!

30:43.341 --> 30:44.342
[Jessica panting]

30:44.425 --> 30:46.636
That hurt so much.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.015
[both grunting]

30:56.604 --> 30:57.939
[gasps]

30:58.023 --> 31:00.108
-[grunts]
-No way.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.653
[grunting]

31:25.633 --> 31:26.885
The scarf looked better.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.972
-Nice ears.
-They're horns.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.807
[indistinct chatter]

31:41.566 --> 31:43.568
Not how I imagined my day looking.

31:48.614 --> 31:50.700
Maybe this is exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

31:51.617 --> 31:52.785
What do you mean?

31:53.703 --> 31:54.913
[Colleen sniffles]

31:56.622 --> 31:57.748
Hidden here.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.210
[sighs and sniffles]

32:01.419 --> 32:02.795
Away from the action.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.716
Left behind.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.386
-I don't even know anymore.
-He was wrong back there.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.138
About your being weak.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.515
[sniffles]

32:19.437 --> 32:23.858
When you're raised
in something like that... [sniffles]

32:26.236 --> 32:29.030
when they've formed the foundation
for who you are...

32:30.573 --> 32:32.617
breaking away is, like...

32:34.119 --> 32:35.786
[chuckles and sniffles]

32:37.663 --> 32:38.999
I feel lost.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.461
I can't believe I'm admitting this, but...

32:44.920 --> 32:46.714
all I want...

32:48.341 --> 32:50.093
is something stable.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.681
Something I can hold on to.
[sighs heavily]

32:57.558 --> 32:58.977
Funny you should say that.

33:00.811 --> 33:03.439
Because I know you. I know Danny.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.526
I know this fight with the Hand.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.321
And where I'm standing...

33:10.905 --> 33:14.284
you are the foundation.

33:21.624 --> 33:22.833
[sniffles]

33:32.260 --> 33:33.844
So how are you holding up?

33:34.595 --> 33:37.015
[sighs] Did you know
Jessica knows Daredevil?

33:37.098 --> 33:38.766
-What? The costume guy?
-Yeah.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.144
And some guy attacked us.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.064
I think it's connected to the tremors.

33:44.814 --> 33:48.526
-I mean, it has to be, right?
-Ugh.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.361
Yeah, um, maybe.

33:51.946 --> 33:52.947
Do you want one?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.241
[indistinct chatter]

33:55.325 --> 33:57.827
-Uh, I'm... I'm okay.
-[chuckles] Smart.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.209
Who's she?

34:07.128 --> 34:08.629
Reporter.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.673
[Malcolm] Think she's here
to write a story?

34:12.758 --> 34:14.009
Doesn't look like it.

34:15.761 --> 34:16.887
[Foggy] You, too?

34:17.722 --> 34:19.057
[Karen chuckles] Jesus!

34:19.140 --> 34:21.101
Oh, my God, am I glad to see you.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.019
-[Foggy] I'm glad to see you.
-[Karen chuckles]

34:24.104 --> 34:26.397
Gotta be honest,
I'm glad to have a break from depositions.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.024
-Yeah. [sighs]
-What's the story?

34:29.109 --> 34:30.235
Matt didn't tell you?

34:30.818 --> 34:32.445
Matt doesn't tell me anything.

34:33.779 --> 34:35.156
It's happening again.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.326
I know. I tried to steer him away.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.161
Yeah, me too.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.788
And it still wasn't enough.
[chuckles softly]

34:42.872 --> 34:44.165
Funny.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.667
If I didn't know any better, I'd think
he's trying to tell us something.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.087
-Yeah.
-[Misty] All right, listen up, everybody.

34:49.170 --> 34:53.258
I know you don't wanna be here,
but it seems that you are all of interest

34:53.341 --> 34:55.635
to some pretty powerful
and dangerous people.

34:55.718 --> 34:59.097
Now, to protect you,
I need your cooperation.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.558
Sit tight for now.
We'll have more answers soon.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.684
Hopefully.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.522
Colleen Wing?

35:07.605 --> 35:08.689
Yeah. Yeah.

35:10.233 --> 35:14.237
I'm told my uniforms
confiscated something unusual from you.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.283
-It's a katana. It was passed down--
-It's weird.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.119
Okay. Uh...

35:22.328 --> 35:24.914
Look, I don't need to be here.
I can defend myself.

35:24.997 --> 35:27.875
You came in here pretty bloody.
Are you sure about that?

35:27.958 --> 35:30.044
[sighs] Yeah.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.255
Yeah, I am.

35:34.174 --> 35:36.551
What can you tell me
about these people that you're fighting?

35:37.343 --> 35:38.636
Nothing.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.846
The more I tell you,
the more danger I put you in.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.266
I'm getting pretty sick
of people telling me that.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.517
It's true.

35:45.976 --> 35:47.312
Why else would we be here?

35:47.895 --> 35:49.397
I'm here 'cause I'm a cop.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.481
[scoffs]

35:51.065 --> 35:53.526
Trust me, they don't give a shit.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.286
Just in case.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.414
Thanks.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.266
Are we no longer on speaking terms?

36:28.811 --> 36:31.814
As long as we're in this organization,

36:31.897 --> 36:34.317
as long as we are alive,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.861
we will be on the same side.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.950
Do you remember what it looks like?

36:44.910 --> 36:45.953
[sighs]

36:48.456 --> 36:53.544
The only way we return to it
is if we secure the Iron Fist.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.046
Oh, that is why I am here.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.131
[scoffs]

36:57.715 --> 37:01.927
But the first person you sought out
was Colleen Wing.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.391
Hmm, yes, that was our assignment.
She could lead us to the Iron Fist.

37:06.474 --> 37:10.060
-And she did. In fact--
-Along with his allies.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.189
It is not as simple this time.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.859
Or you are not as committed.

37:18.193 --> 37:23.491
Your judgment has always been clouded
when it comes to your old disciples.

37:26.369 --> 37:32.124
Just because I don't blind my disciples,
doesn't mean I'm made weak by them.

37:32.958 --> 37:34.294
[footsteps approaching]

37:37.713 --> 37:39.590
-It's good to see you.
-[Alexandra] Save it.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.885
-We have a situation.
-We know, and we plan to correct it.

37:42.968 --> 37:46.764
We will discuss your failure
to acquire a few bargaining chips next.

37:46.847 --> 37:47.848
But first...

37:47.932 --> 37:50.685
[Murakami in Japanese] The Iron Fist
has a new partner in his fight.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.563
Daredevil.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.361
[Sowande choking]

38:00.445 --> 38:05.366
-[chuckles] So cool.
-I mean, it's... it's kind of cool.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.329
[Daredevil] I'm gonna make
this real simple.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.832
You're gonna answer our questions
or shit's gonna get dark in here.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.917
[Sowande] What do they call you?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.503
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen?

38:17.587 --> 38:19.004
[choking]

38:21.549 --> 38:25.803
Even if you could kill me,
it wouldn't make a difference.

38:26.637 --> 38:30.433
Cut off a finger... [scoffs]
you can still use your hand.

38:30.516 --> 38:33.686
We will win. We have armies.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.314
We have our weapon.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.318
Let's talk about your weapon.
What did you do to her?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.696
What did you do to Elektra?

38:45.239 --> 38:46.240
Elektra?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.283
-Yeah.
-[choking]

38:49.410 --> 38:51.245
You dug up her grave.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.540
-[continues choking]
-And what did you turn her into?

38:54.624 --> 38:59.420
The body you knew was merely a vessel,
waiting for its purpose.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.423
She's ours now.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.049
If she's your vessel...

39:05.300 --> 39:06.927
why hasn't she killed me yet?

39:07.887 --> 39:11.891
Twice now, she could've taken my life,
but she hasn't. Why do you think that is?

39:13.267 --> 39:14.268
Huh?

39:15.185 --> 39:16.896
Your weapon is defective.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.190
Then she will be destroyed.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.901
[Daredevil grunts]

39:22.902 --> 39:24.487
Not on my watch.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.196
Hey, stop. You can't undo this.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.784
-[groaning]
-Admit it.

39:29.867 --> 39:33.454
-Elektra's still in there. You failed.
-You're the one who failed.

39:34.914 --> 39:38.834
Elektra died on a rooftop in your arms
because you couldn't protect her.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.211
-[choking]
-[yells]

39:42.963 --> 39:44.214
Shit.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.008
[panting]

39:50.680 --> 39:51.764
Is he dead?

39:52.390 --> 39:55.142
Eh, unfortunately, no. Passed out.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.025
I think it's time to tell them
the truth, kid.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.614
[panting]

40:12.535 --> 40:13.536
[sniffs]

40:13.619 --> 40:14.787
Are you sure?

40:14.870 --> 40:18.123
Daredevil has not been active
in this city for a while.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.000
[in Japanese] I saw him with my own eyes.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.628
Why is this a concern?

40:22.712 --> 40:25.005
He's a skilled fighter, yes,
but so are we.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.257
It is not his fighting that worries me.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.802
It is his relationship
with Elektra Natchios.

40:31.721 --> 40:35.600
She fought side by side with him
in her last life.

40:35.683 --> 40:36.726
[Murakami] It is more than that.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.019
He is the one she loved.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.148
When she attacked me...

40:43.983 --> 40:47.987
at first, I thought
she was protecting her kill.

40:48.070 --> 40:51.281
But you think she was protecting him.

40:51.365 --> 40:57.121
I do not think she is the empty vessel
we were promised.

40:57.204 --> 41:00.207
Is this what you wanted
to discuss with me earlier?

41:00.290 --> 41:03.711
You believe the Black Sky has failed us?

41:03.794 --> 41:04.837
No.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.299
I believe you have.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.053
You made a unilateral decision

41:13.137 --> 41:15.515
and used the last of the substance
to resurrect her.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.850
And now, we are all vulnerable.

41:17.933 --> 41:22.563
[takes deep breath] Actually, I have never
felt better than with her at my side.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.399
Except, it's not about you.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.653
It's about us.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.948
[Bakuto] He's right.

41:33.533 --> 41:37.369
Five fingers created the Hand.
We're stronger together.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.874
There are only four now.
Sowande is gone.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.585
-He will return.
-[Bakuto] You don't know that.

41:44.669 --> 41:48.422
For the first time,
death is a possibility.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.132
Even if he doesn't,

41:50.716 --> 41:51.926
we will survive.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.678
Except the Black Sky...

41:55.429 --> 41:56.972
almost killed me.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.560
Then there would be three.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.856
Perhaps this is what we needed.

42:06.524 --> 42:10.861
A reminder that everyone in this room
is expendable.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.613
Everyone.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.199
Including you.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.745
You seem to have forgotten
why we started this mission.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.958
Why we need the Iron Fist.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.292
No, I haven't.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.798
It's because we all want to live
to see another day.

42:31.506 --> 42:33.342
You are afraid of dying.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.721
We want to live long enough to go home.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.431
[Murakami] Perhaps...

42:40.683 --> 42:44.228
it's time to make a plan
without the Black Sky.

42:45.437 --> 42:47.898
Or our fearless leader.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.160
[Danny] I was willing to work with you.

43:01.411 --> 43:02.747
But how can I trust you?

43:06.834 --> 43:08.127
[Matt] Her name is Elektra.

43:09.419 --> 43:12.422
She was raised by him.
Trained to fight the Hand.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.009
Which she did, with me.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.970
Until they convinced themselves she could
serve another purpose and killed her.

43:18.053 --> 43:21.473
-She looked pretty alive back there.
-I know, but I was there when they...

43:22.767 --> 43:23.893
[Matt sighs]

43:25.477 --> 43:27.021
I was holding her when she died.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.773
[Stick] Elektra died.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.317
That thing we've been fighting,
it's something else.

43:33.235 --> 43:34.444
She was resurrected.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.614
Right.

43:38.573 --> 43:39.700
How come you didn't tell us?

43:39.784 --> 43:42.161
Wait a minute. [stammers]
What do you mean, "resurrected"?

43:42.912 --> 43:44.288
[Stick] His ex-girlfriend.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.582
-Now he thinks he can save her.
-That's why you nearly got us killed?

43:47.667 --> 43:50.085
When I said her name, she recognized it.
She knew me.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.171
I think whatever they did
when they resurrected her,

43:52.254 --> 43:53.547
I think I can get through to her.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.884
Okay, to be clear, we've now used
the word "resurrected" three times.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.218
It's what they do.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.514
We agreed to put everything
on the table, Matt.

44:02.597 --> 44:05.643
[Stick] If we're gonna defeat the Hand,
we gotta take her out.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.102
No, Stick. I won't allow it.

44:07.186 --> 44:08.938
Do you know how hard this is
to believe?

44:09.021 --> 44:12.274
It doesn't matter what you believe,
at the end of the day...

44:12.357 --> 44:14.609
whatever she is, she's a problem.

44:15.945 --> 44:18.072
-[Jessica] Lying is a problem.
-[Matt] I didn't wanna lie.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.908
-I was trying to protect her.
-[Luke] Well, I'm not.

44:20.991 --> 44:24.119
Now the people I care about are held up
in a precinct because you got me

44:24.203 --> 44:25.620
protecting some woman you used to know.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.206
[Matt] Don't oversimplify it.
I'm trying to help.

44:27.289 --> 44:28.874
The truth is simple, Murdock.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.375
[both grunting]

44:30.459 --> 44:32.878
-[Danny groans]
-[Sowande] Don't move.

44:35.589 --> 44:37.007
Let's not kid each other.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.510
This is personal for every one of us.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.138
But now I have the Iron Fist.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.891
The key to what the Hand seeks.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.895
The key to life, to our salvation.

44:50.687 --> 44:52.106
The war is over.

44:53.273 --> 44:54.984
-[Jessica gasps]
-[Luke] Oh.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.443
Not yet.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.038
[door opens]

45:15.004 --> 45:16.005
My child?

45:16.756 --> 45:17.923
I need a word.
