NATHAN: Previously on Haven...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.171
Duke Crocker.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.291
Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:06.591 --> 00:08.422
-This is Evi.
-|'m Duke's wife.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.177
"Love conquers all."

00:10.261 --> 00:11.717
Why are you even here?

00:11.804 --> 00:13.214
It's my dad, okay?

00:13.306 --> 00:15.843
The old bastard made me swear
that I would come back here

00:15.933 --> 00:17.184
if The Troubles ever returned.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.930
And then, he died.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.388
Telling me why? Well, that never happened.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.140
-Duke doesn't suspect anything?
-No.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.776
And now that he knows
his father was murdered,

00:29.447 --> 00:31.233
you've got him.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.253
(EXHALES)

00:58.100 --> 00:59.965
All yours, Brother.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.950
Breakfast? I made pancakes.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.785
Good. I didn't make enough.

01:20.957 --> 01:23.744
I think I've found
what we've been looking for.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.663
After I deal with it, we'll have steak.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.519
(FIRING)

(TUNING)

02:20.516 --> 02:22.928
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

02:35.239 --> 02:37.901
It really hurts my feelings when you do that.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.241
Now get the hell out of the car.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.361
There's someone I need to kill.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.544
You want these up here?

02:53.215 --> 02:54.295
That'll work.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.096
Sorry.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.636
Don't worry about it.

03:05.728 --> 03:08.265
Ain't a party till something gets broken.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.813
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. No problem.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.068
Let me just pay for these,

03:13.152 --> 03:16.235
'cause, you know, you've been so cool
with the whole job and the extra cash and...

03:16.322 --> 03:18.563
I don't want your money.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.496
You doing okay?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.451
I think I might be in some serious trouble.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.787
You just have to promise
that you won't tell the cops.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.624
lwon't call the cops. I promise.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.460
I saw something.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.253
What do you mean, you saw something?

03:42.348 --> 03:45.135
I saw something
that I wasn't supposed to see.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.386
Out at the EvenNood.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.968
The Even/vood? That place is abandoned.
What were you doing out there?

03:57.822 --> 03:58.902
How can I help you?

04:03.828 --> 04:05.489
A single malt.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.573
An old one.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.992
I can do that.

04:22.388 --> 04:23.753
Thank you.

04:27.685 --> 04:31.803
Now I want a pina colada.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.521
Unfortunately,

04:35.985 --> 04:38.192
-my blender is broken.
-(GROANS)

04:38.571 --> 04:39.902
Mr...

04:41.240 --> 04:43.026
-Do you have a name?
-Yes, I do.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.740
Do you have a kid working for you?

04:47.413 --> 04:49.745
No. Not lately.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.572
A kid named Henry?

04:54.253 --> 04:56.244
-Henry...
-Henry.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.996
I knew a Helen once. A Henrietta.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.134
But no Henry.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.043
If you don't mind me asking,

05:04.138 --> 05:06.174
why are you looking for this kid?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.548
If you don't know him, why would you care?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.348
Fair enough.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.433
You know what?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.731
I think I may have
an extra blender around here.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.399
Let me just check.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.103
I'm sure that I saw it down here.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.988
Get ready to run.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.450
I apologize. I can't seem to find it.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.873
How about another scotch?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.702
No. I don't like liars.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.793
Liars are cowards.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.425
You know what, friend?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.590
I think it's time for you to leave.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.966
Okay.

05:51.227 --> 05:52.637
But I'm not gonna pay you.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.307
If that's the price of you leaving,
I can live with that.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.812
Henry, I'll be waiting for you outside.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.482
What the hell do you want with Henry?

06:04.615 --> 06:06.321
None of your business.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.941
Take your hand off me,
or one of us will get hurt.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.569
That's another thing I can live with.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.462
Henry, run!

06:37.606 --> 06:38.641
(YELLS IN PAIN)

07:41.170 --> 07:42.330
Are you okay?

07:42.421 --> 07:44.537
Yeah, it's just a few bumps.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.839
Yeah, he's doing his too-cool-for-pain thing.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.426
Course he is.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.301
All right, so who'd you piss off this time?

07:51.847 --> 07:53.838
Maybe he pissed me off.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.476
-|s that a possibility?
-Yeah, it's the least likely.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.014
-You got a name for me?
-No, I don't have a name,

08:00.105 --> 08:02.312
but all you have to do
is go look for a guy in a suit

08:02.399 --> 08:03.775
with a bullet hole in his right arm.

08:03.859 --> 08:04.939
Anything else?

08:05.027 --> 08:07.564
He liked to spin a coin
on my bar like a dreidel?

08:10.074 --> 08:13.032
I gave you the license plate number,
now it's yourjob to go and find him.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.076
Duke, you're not telling me everything.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.157
(SIGHS)

08:19.500 --> 08:21.456
I am secretly afraid of bananas,

08:22.336 --> 08:24.918
I've never been windsurfing naked,
and deep-down in my heart,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.246
I know that Bigfoot is real.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.421
Hey, Nathan.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.591
All you missed
is Duke not telling me everything.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.669
-I take offense to that.
-l'm sorry I missed it.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.258
So the plates are registered
to Cornell Stamoran.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.932
He's the vice president
of the Maine Associated Bank.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.720
-Did you rob him lately?
-Can I get a break? l'm injured.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.351
I told you guys everything I know.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.016
All right, let's go find Cornell.

08:47.111 --> 08:50.854
And you are not done. I expect to see you
down at the station for a statement.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.438
I can't wait.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.115
I'm sorry I was late.
This papenIvork, it's crazy.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.238
I wish we could keep just one set of files,
you know.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.196
Sometimes editing the troubled
out of our official reports,

09:00.290 --> 09:01.575
it feels like half myjob.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.500
Well, that's why the selectmen
pay you the big bucks, Chief.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.621
NATHAN: Hmm.

09:11.301 --> 09:15.544
Hey, hey, hey. I see what you're thinking.
Just take it easy, let them do theirjob.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.924
And I'm gonna do mine.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.225
NATHAN: Just because your boyfriend
sent it to you from London

09:29.319 --> 09:31.275
isn't a reason for you to eat Vegemite.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.604
AUDREY: Well, millions of Australians
would disagree with you,

09:33.699 --> 09:36.782
and that's not why I'm trying it.
I'm trying it to make sure that I don't like it.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.238
Listen, if my memories are not my own,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.741
just because I remember not liking Vegemite

09:41.832 --> 09:43.197
doesn't mean that I don't.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.624
You lead a very complicated life.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.451
Tell me about it.

09:56.472 --> 09:58.508
-Cornell Stamoran?
-Yes.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.593
Put your hands on the wall
and spread your legs, please.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.891
Why? What? There must be some mistake.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.015
We have a report that you were involved
in a shooting earlier today.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.646
I've been home all day.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.724
No weapons. No injuries.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.355
I told you, lwas home. In fact, I can prove it.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.983
l was on the house phone
with my assistant most of the morning.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.404
Call her.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.357
Did you let anyone use your car today?

10:18.577 --> 10:21.159
-What's going on?
-Okay, can you show us your car, please?

10:23.916 --> 10:25.952
-|s that your car?
-Yes, it is.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.996
Plates match.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.515
NATHAN: He's headed for the EvenNood.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.458
Duke, what are you doing here?

11:10.546 --> 11:12.411
Can we discuss this later?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.419
-|t's the guy from The Gull!
-That looks like Cornell.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.751
He couldn't have beat us here.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.007
I don't think that's him, look at his arm.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.759
(YELLS)

11:32.359 --> 11:34.600
He's dead. Are you okay?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.401
I'm really good, thanks for asking.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.904
-Who is this guy?
-Cornell Stamoran.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.324
Yeah, but the Cornell we were just talking to
wasn't wounded, I checked.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.493
Do you think he has a twin?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.417
-What are you doing?
-l'm checking him for the tattoo.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.753
VVhy?

11:54.840 --> 11:58.879
The tattoo is some kind of symbol
for a secret society of troubled people.

11:59.219 --> 12:03.212
-And one of them wants to kill me.
-| get that. But why? Why are you here?

12:03.307 --> 12:06.549
I'm guessing it has to do with
why you were lying to us earlier at The Gull.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.258
-(RATTLING)
-Look...

12:08.604 --> 12:10.140
What was that?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.937
Where the hell did he come from?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.354
-NATHAN: Wait, what are you doing?
-Henry's in there.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.074
Oh, great. There's a Henry
he hasn't told us about. Fantastic.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.403
NATHAN: lt's Duke. What do you expect?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.950
-AUDREY: What is this place?
-NATHAN: Even/vood Resort.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.036
It was gonna be a big deal
about 10 years ago,

12:35.130 --> 12:37.041
then the developers ran out of money
and just left it.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.372
AUDREY: It's a maze.
We should leave breadcrumbs.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.582
NATHAN: Yeah.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.587
You guys saw that, right?
I mean, it wasn'tjust me.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.134
Wasn't just you.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.463
This guy dies,
then another one shows up in his place?

12:46.558 --> 12:47.764
NATHAN: Could be Cornell.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.467
AUDREY: Okay. So was it Henry
you were lying about at The Gull?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.940
You know, "lying" is such an ugly word.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.894
But, yeah, I lied.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.734
Henry's the kid who's been working for me.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.568
He said that he witnessed something here
one night,

13:04.952 --> 13:06.988
and no, I don't know what he saw.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.240
What makes you think
Cornell's looking for Henry?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.071
That's why he was at The Gull.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.874
He was looking for Henry, not me.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.418
I promised the kid I wouldn't go to the cops.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.665
AUDREY: Somebody's trying to kill a kid,

13:17.756 --> 13:19.838
and you promised him
you wouldn't go to the cops?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.290
Seriously?

13:21.385 --> 13:22.625
All right, I see your point.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.004
Maybe you shouldn't be
giving me a hard time,

13:24.096 --> 13:26.132
and instead calling for backup.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.929
This doesn't seem to be
a guy who dies easily.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.257
No backup, too many witnesses.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.434
Like no one in Haven
knows what happens in Haven.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.261
Well, maybe they do,
but I don't want to give the Rev

13:34.356 --> 13:35.641
any more ammunition.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.393
(BANGING)

14:08.181 --> 14:10.092
Those look like Henry's clothes.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.096
This must be where he's crashing.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.646
-|t's not bad.
-Really?

14:19.151 --> 14:21.062
What? I've stayed in worse.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.446
A man can make his castle anywhere.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.193
Yeah, a man can.
But you said Henry's a kid, right?

14:28.285 --> 14:30.492
He's older than I was when l was on my own.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.236
He's smart, he'll figure it out.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.822
Yeah, if we can find him before Cornell does.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.877
Yeah, I think we can do that.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.380
In all my castles,

14:46.178 --> 14:48.464
| always had a real good hiding place.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.138
Henry.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.803
You can come out, it's all right.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.609
It's okay.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.434
They're my friends.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.857
You can trust them.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.451
-You all right?
-HENRY: Yeah.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.655
I'm okay. That guyjust came by here, though.
I heard him.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.415
Henry, we need to know
what we're up against.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.666
Is there any reason you can think of
for why he's chasing you?

15:23.799 --> 15:24.879
Henry, tell him.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.250
-He killed someone.
-Who did?

15:28.637 --> 15:30.173
The guy that came into the bar.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.801
I've been sleeping here for a while,
and they came in, arguing.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.099
He shot him.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.718
So I screamed, and they saw me.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.933
(COCKS GUN)

15:41.024 --> 15:42.059
(FIRING)

15:45.529 --> 15:46.609
DUKE: Go!

15:48.824 --> 15:50.906
-Who was this guy?
-AUDREY: Or guys.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.736
I know this place. We have to go right.

16:01.253 --> 16:02.959

-Your friends, they left!

16:03.046 --> 16:04.627
They can take care of themselves!

16:06.675 --> 16:09.087
Nathan, Duke and Henry are gone.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.917
-Go.
-Yeah.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.092
Did you see where they went?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.842
No. We must have gotten separated.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.102
Drop your gun, now!

16:18.311 --> 16:19.471
I don't have a gun.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.973
On the ground, now!

16:21.314 --> 16:23.305
Oh, thank God. Thank God you're here.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.693
You have to help me, please.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.393
-They won't stop coming.
-Who's "they"?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.864
I'm the original Cornell.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.363
What do you mean,
you're the original Cornell?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.071
I knew this day would come.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.907
If you let me stand up,
I'm gonna show you something.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.955
Something you're not gonna believe.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.915
In the next room.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.670
Okay, here.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.298
I didn't know what else to do with them,

16:57.392 --> 16:59.303
so I put them here.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.680
No one ever comes to this place.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.729
This is them.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.901
My copies.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.080
NATHAN: Who are they?

17:29.883 --> 17:31.748
-What are they?
-I don't know.

17:31.843 --> 17:34.710
ljust keep thinking about them as my copies.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.594
They seem to have all my memories.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.844
They look exactly like me,
but I can't control them.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.268
Theyjust showed up one day,
and they won't stop coming.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.767
-Why did you kill them?
-What else could I do?

17:45.857 --> 17:47.267
l tied one up, and he escaped.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.977
They only have one thing in their mind,
to kill some guy named Henry.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.816
How am I supposed to deal with this?
l was just trying to stop them.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.239
-You don't know who Henry is?
-No.

18:00.747 --> 18:05.116
The only thing that I know
is that my copies want him dead.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.290
I don't know why.

18:06.378 --> 18:09.120
Did you kill one of your copies
here at the resort?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.462
Yes. The first one.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.875
-You think that's what Henry saw?
-Maybe.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.503
You believe me, don't you?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.509
Why would we believe you?
You lied to us earlier at the house.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.638
What was I supposed to tell you?
"Oh, it's not me. It's a guy that looks like me,

18:24.729 --> 18:26.640
"that keeps coming back to life,
wearing my clothes."

18:26.731 --> 18:29.063
Okay. Fair point,
but why did you bring them here?

18:29.150 --> 18:31.186
I didn't know what else to do with them.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.485
My bank keeps the account for this place.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.527
I knew no one ever comes up here.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.991
You can't imagine
what it's like to kill yourself.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.818
It sounds insane, even to say it.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.449
Okay, if he's the original Cornell,

18:43.540 --> 18:45.576
that means that the copy's
still out there somewhere.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.749
So we need to find Duke and Henry, now.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.120
Don't have a signal. I need to get upstairs.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.798
There's only one way in here.
You should be able to keep safe.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.965
Be careful.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.343
My copies are the worst part of me.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.653
You picked a hell of a place to squat.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.527
Yeah, I mean, it's out of the way.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.859
Figured no one would find me.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.410
Yeah, kind of wish that had
worked out better for you, don't you?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.703
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.582
Is anybody else looking for you?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.580
Nobody with a shotgun.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.216
Hey,

19:39.304 --> 19:41.090
how come you never asked me
why I left home?

19:41.222 --> 19:42.382
What?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.594
It was none of my business.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.481
When my mom left,

19:51.399 --> 19:53.890
my father and l, we got along for a while.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.362
Now he barely even notices me.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.946
He didn't even try and stop me when I left.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.069
Well, fathers are tough.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.535
my father,

20:14.005 --> 20:16.542
he had a whole other life
he didn't tell me about.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.045
Leaving my family behind,

20:20.136 --> 20:21.922
that was the best decision I ever made.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.937
Come on.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.692
-Come on, man. Let's go.
-No, I can't. You go.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.571
Henry! Henry!

20:46.371 --> 20:47.781
Damn kid.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.915
-Please don't hurt me.
-Hands where I can see them!

21:01.636 --> 21:03.001
You have to help me, please.

21:03.847 --> 21:04.962
Where's Audrey?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.257
-|s that your partner?
-You were just with her.

21:09.394 --> 21:12.306
No, ljust got here! I live 10 miles away.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.220
You were there.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.686
Oh, my God.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.360

21:34.377 --> 21:36.789
All right, we're gonna wait
one more minute for Nathan,

21:36.880 --> 21:38.586
and then we're going after him.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.914
Sounds perfect.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.683
Yeah, I'm sure he's right around the corner.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.578
Okay. I'm gonna go check on Nathan now.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.791
You sure that's safe?

22:21.049 --> 22:22.585
Leave the coin.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.129
The coin gave me away, didn't it?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.841
I really need to get rid of it.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.895
Which way?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.489
-I don't know.
-Really?

22:52.997 --> 22:54.862
That was pretty good, huh? (CHUCKLES)

22:55.416 --> 22:56.792
"What else could I do?"

22:57.377 --> 22:59.288
He's so easy to imitate, you know?

23:00.129 --> 23:03.166
ljust do me, and take out the cool parts.

23:03.758 --> 23:06.340
(SIGHS) So how does all of this work?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.381
You know what's in his head?

23:09.472 --> 23:13.181
l have all his memories,
but the balls are mine.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.972
So you're a copy.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.595
Not a copy.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.021
A better version.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.524
You and I actually have
something in common.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.023
l have somebody else's memories
inside my head, too.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.195
-Come on.
-No, it's true.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.825
Never thought I'd have something in common
with the worst part of someone.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.493
Do you ever wonder if you're real?

23:39.252 --> 23:42.744
(LAUGHS) Why would I want to do that?

23:42.839 --> 23:45.000
Does that bruise on your leg feel real?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.503
Unfortunately, yes.

23:49.637 --> 23:50.843
But,

23:51.389 --> 23:53.801
if we have somebody else's memories,

23:53.891 --> 23:56.268
then what makes us, us?

23:57.729 --> 23:58.889
You think too hard.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.265
(CHUCKLES)

24:01.899 --> 24:03.105
What's funny?

24:03.693 --> 24:06.309
My best friend, Brenda,
used to say I think too hard

24:06.404 --> 24:07.769
in the sixth grade.

24:08.323 --> 24:12.316
Except for that she wasn't really my friend,
'cause I never met her.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.776
She was somebody else's friend,

24:14.871 --> 24:17.829
not mine.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.746
Do you have a best friend?

24:25.715 --> 24:27.546
Okay, I'll play.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.800
Matt Werner, my best friend,

24:31.304 --> 24:34.922
until he accused me of taking
the silver dollar his grandfather gave him.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.640
Huge fight, still pissed.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.603
Well, see, now you can let that go,
because he didn't fight with you.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.520
-He fought with Cornell.
-Hmm?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.062
But he was right. I did steal it.

I mean, every night l have to make myself
forget everything that I'm not,

24:59.916 --> 25:02.123
and every day I gotta figure out what I am.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.705
-What makes you real.
-Yeah.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.962
Who wants to be just a copy?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.675
You know what the best part is, though?

25:14.597 --> 25:17.839
The best part is that the woman
whose memories I have,

25:18.476 --> 25:21.092
she went to Quantico, which means
she learned how to do this...

25:22.188 --> 25:23.223
(GRUNTS)

25:37.328 --> 25:42.823
(SIGHS) So the whole talk
was really just to distract me?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.874
At the beginning, yeah,

25:46.337 --> 25:48.498
but then, no.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.793
When I kill you, eventually,

25:52.677 --> 25:54.463
I'm not gonna be happy about it.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.303
But it's not going to stop me.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.276
Nathan? Where the hell are you?

26:18.995 --> 26:21.737
-Can I help you, Selectman?
-Looking for Chief Wuornos. Is he around?

26:21.831 --> 26:24.117
Out on a call. Something I can help you with?

26:24.208 --> 26:25.914
That's all right, I'll leave him a note.

Sorry, I couldn't take the chance
that I'd lose it.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.464
-You didn't have to come back for me.
-Yeah, well, it was on my way.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.221
-That is what you risked our life for?
-It was my father's.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.303
He got it in Iraq.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.642
He told me that, you know,
it would watch over me on the road.

27:36.197 --> 27:39.189
You said that he didn't stop you.

27:40.117 --> 27:43.359
Well, not so much didn't stop me as

27:43.454 --> 27:44.830
couldn't.

-The fun we'll have.
-It will be fun.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.099
Let's do it.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.538
Out of bullets?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.166
DUKE: Maybe.

33:24.378 --> 33:25.743
We're not.

33:26.338 --> 33:30.251
As you've noticed,
I've been laying in an armory for some time.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.668
Perfect. We run out of ammo
just when they start working together.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.927
AUDREY: Haven PD is on their way!

33:36.265 --> 33:38.551
Give us Nathan, and we'll be gone.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.598
Giving you time to get away.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.427
Just so you know,

33:42.521 --> 33:45.308
nobody, myself included,
buys it when cops say that.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.435
Your friend will be the first one to die.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.232
Then the rest of you.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.435
I say we rush them.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.565
Yeah, that's brave,
but we're out of ammunition.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.942
Okay, look, we convince him...

33:55.534 --> 33:58.276
Okay, well, except it's not him.
Now it's two of him.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.032
So it'll be twice as hard. Never mind.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.998
No, maybe not.

34:06.837 --> 34:09.544
Promise me
you'll get Henry out of here this time.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.748
Yeah. Come on.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.833
I put my gun down!

34:14.637 --> 34:15.968
Audrey!

34:17.014 --> 34:19.972
Please, I'm asking you,

34:21.185 --> 34:22.766
don't hurt my partner.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.768
A little late for that.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.516
I'm not talking to you.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.941
I'm talking to your copy.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.200
Why? What is she gonna do, kill me?

34:41.956 --> 34:44.572
-Shoot her, and let's get on with it.
-(SHUSHES)

34:45.084 --> 34:47.951
I would like to talk to her for a while.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.455
Why? What do you care about her?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.296
We have something very important
in common.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.970
Henry didn't witness your crime.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.383
He witnessed his.

35:00.683 --> 35:03.299
My crimes are his crimes.

35:03.686 --> 35:04.801
VVhy?

35:05.479 --> 35:07.219
Because he remembers doing them?

35:08.816 --> 35:11.398
We're notjust the sum total
of our memories, are we?

35:11.568 --> 35:12.694
What does it matter?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.318
It matters to me.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.195
And it matters to him.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.868
If you kill us now,
all you're going to remember

35:22.955 --> 35:24.661
is having to clean up after him.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.658
Or you can have your own memory.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.536
A memory of saving a boy's life.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.887
About time. Kill her.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.052
And let's go.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.512
You know what you're asking of me?

35:50.566 --> 35:52.431
I'm giving you a chance

35:53.068 --> 35:54.933
to have what I had.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.562
A chance to make my own life,

35:57.823 --> 36:00.189
a chance to save lives, not end them.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.866
This may be the only one you get.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.782
You're testing me, aren't you?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.201
Fine, I'm in.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.297
Watch this.

36:16.842 --> 36:17.877
(GUN FIRES)

36:40.282 --> 36:42.489
Don't tell Matt Werner I gave it to you.

36:59.593 --> 37:00.878
Come on in, Nathan.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.051
Listen, all the selectmen want to know,

37:04.598 --> 37:06.134
how are you recovering?

37:06.642 --> 37:08.303
Getting there. Thanks.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.012
Good.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.224
Everything that happened up at EvenNood,

37:13.315 --> 37:15.146
you put that all in the case files, am I right?

37:15.859 --> 37:17.520
Yeah, of course.

37:18.445 --> 37:19.605
Why are you asking?

37:24.660 --> 37:26.696
These tell a different story.

37:28.372 --> 37:29.657
How did you get those?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.454
You've been falsifying police reports.

37:31.542 --> 37:34.659
I've been doing
what we've always done in Haven.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.287
Since when do we want
The Troubles in reports?

37:43.554 --> 37:45.044
Since someone wants me out?

37:45.639 --> 37:47.379
We have no choice, Nathan, I'm sorry.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.260
We're gonna be looking
for a new chief immediately.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.050
It's the Rev, isn't it?

37:53.856 --> 37:56.017
Does he control all the selectmen,
orjust you?

37:56.108 --> 37:59.521
Nathan, your father was a good friend to me,
so let me give you a little advice.

38:00.654 --> 38:03.270
-You might want to leave Haven.
-Excuse me?

38:03.365 --> 38:05.526
Things are gonna get a little rough
for your kind.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.286
Then I'm not going anywhere.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.540
So where are you planning
on staying now, Henry?

38:25.345 --> 38:26.846
Find something.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.305
You like living on your own?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.053
I mean, always on the move?

38:34.521 --> 38:37.479
I think it's the best place to find yourself.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.312
Sure.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.451
I can't believe you called my dad.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.407
Yeah, it kind of blows my mind, too.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.373
But sometimes

39:05.761 --> 39:08.127
it's tricky knowing who the good guy is.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.435
Hey, kiddo.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.284
Hey. How you been?

39:39.920 --> 39:43.253
It's too bad. I think
he was actually starting to like that job.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.543
Flying raisin.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.253
Yeah, I think he was.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.844
How about a dance?

39:54.309 --> 39:57.642
I've always wanted to dance
with the Chief of Police.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.185
No, ma'am, actually, if you could...

39:59.273 --> 40:00.558
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:01.483 --> 40:03.098
Why not, hmm?

40:03.527 --> 40:04.687
Thank you.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.571
Well, I guess that answers that.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.787
Nathan definitely has a copy.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.705
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.700
And this one still can't dance.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.879
Back at the resort,

40:26.967 --> 40:30.175
did you mean everything
that you said to Cornell's copy?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.882
Or were you just

40:34.099 --> 40:35.339
playing him?

40:38.395 --> 40:40.135
Both, I guess.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.222
He needed to move past his memories,

40:44.318 --> 40:47.105
so that he would learn
what he was capable of.

40:53.869 --> 40:56.110
Okay, I gotta get a picture of this.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.946
-Please.
-We need a record of the day

40:59.041 --> 41:01.532
that Nathan Wuornos got funky.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.369
-Do you have a camera on your phone?
-No, it's upstairs.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.670
Hey, Evi has one on hers.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.380
Okay.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.048
Oh, that's a keeper.

41:14.431 --> 41:16.171
Send that to me.
