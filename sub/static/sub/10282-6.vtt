00:44.145 --> 00:46.280
( pounding machine )

00:49.717 --> 00:52.553
( pounding machine )

00:57.825 --> 01:02.196
( baby crying )

01:04.331 --> 01:06.400
( shushing )

01:08.869 --> 01:10.704
All right.

01:10.738 --> 01:14.342
Who do I gotta screw to get
some health care around here?!

01:15.176 --> 01:16.744
Well, honey,

01:16.777 --> 01:19.247
why don't you try an intern?
They're always hard up.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.581
Come on, Jeremy,
I'll take you back.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.615
Where?

01:21.649 --> 01:23.351
To see the doctor.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.518
My dad here yet?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.187
No. He's on his way.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.855
Can I give my
ticket to you?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.623
Just a little longer, sir.

01:29.657 --> 01:30.824
D-D-Don't make me late.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.426
My baggage already
went through.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.494
Right.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.329
Come on, Jeremy.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.166
11-year-old boy

01:38.166 --> 01:39.367
with multiple lacs.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.368
Hey, how you
doing, little man?

01:40.401 --> 01:41.435
TV fell on him.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.636
Kids were
home alone.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.672
Okay, we'll get
to him real soon.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.340
Standard of care is primary
closure within six hours.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.775
Standard of care
is for rookies.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.911
Get him started, Jane. Dr. Pratt
will be right there.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.447
And, I got a real
winner for you.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.249
Belly pain with
combustible breath.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.185
You talking about
that creepy homeless guy?

01:57.185 --> 01:58.586
"Creepy" I'll give you, but
I don't think he's homeless.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.521
How 'bout we wait
till he sobers up?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.256
I'll be home
and in bed by then.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.491
He needs to be
examined, Pratt.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.525
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.593
How long's he been here?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.295
Oh, about two hours.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.663
He thinks he's in an
airport or something.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.663
He's altered?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.500
Yeah, a little.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.734
If you ask me, we need
to have one line
for legitimate patients,

02:13.767 --> 02:15.469
another line
for all the rest.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.704
Yeah, well, good thing
nobody asked you.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.306
Luka, our UTI,
dislocated shoulder

02:18.339 --> 02:19.773
and rapid hair loss all
need to be signed out.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.242
I haven't been this starved

02:21.275 --> 02:22.843
since the last
Burning Man festival.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.212
Who wants some 'za?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.313
You had a burger a
couple of hours ago.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.814
Fast metabolism.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.217
Pratt, wheezing guy was driving
insomnia lady crazy

02:29.250 --> 02:31.452
so I moved him
into Exam Three.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.354
Okay, beautiful.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.855
Okay, who's the lucky bastard
that gets to take my blood?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.757
I need CBC, LFTs and amylase.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.791
I'll do it.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.793
Is this about your needle stick?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.295
Yeah.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.364
You gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

02:43.397 --> 02:44.965
Hey, this is Dr. Barnett
from County.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.401
I'll take six-- no, no, no,
make that seven. I'll take

02:47.435 --> 02:48.836
two pepperoni,
two sausage and pepper,

02:48.869 --> 02:50.938
two Hawaiian
and one with the works.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.673
It's, let's see,
11:23 right now.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.775
So we'll get that
at 12:03, right?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.344
All right, man. Cool.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.279
Seven pies. What
the hell was that about?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.947
Guaranteed delivery
within 40 minutes

02:59.980 --> 03:02.416
or there's no charge, but
what the guy doesn't know

03:02.450 --> 03:03.851
is that Wacker's closed

03:03.884 --> 03:05.653
and the Loop
is a parking lot.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.455
There is such a thing
as a free lunch, my friend.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.857
Luka. Belly-pain guy's
going down.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.297
Somebody bring a gurney!

03:16.330 --> 03:18.299
Sir. Open your
eyes, sir.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.534
Hey, doctor, no way. Uh-uh.
I was here before him.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.569
Vitals were normal
when I triaged him

03:21.602 --> 03:22.770
a couple of hours ago.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.705
That nurse told me
I was next.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.707
Diaphoretic, carotid's
weak and thready.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.276
70 systolic.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.810
Hey, is that what it takes,
huh? Flopping around

03:29.843 --> 03:31.345
on the floor
like I'm dying?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.514
Yeah, don't push me!
Watch me! Hey!

03:33.547 --> 03:34.582
One, two, three.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.616
Get him on O2 right away.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.650
Here we go!

03:36.684 --> 03:39.553
Hey! Look at me! Look!

03:39.587 --> 03:41.422
My bag. My bag.
I want the bag?

03:41.455 --> 03:42.790
I got it!

03:42.823 --> 03:44.792
Stat EKG in case
he's having an M.I.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.294
What about me, huh?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.728
I could be having an M.I., too!

03:47.761 --> 03:49.730
Any history
of hepatitis?

03:49.763 --> 03:50.864
Abby, can you give us a hand?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.500
What about
my blood draw?

03:52.533 --> 03:55.303
I'll write you a note.
Get a 12-lead going.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.304
Where am I?

03:56.304 --> 03:57.338
Sam, you've got the IV.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.939
Where am I?
What are you doing?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.974
Okay. Hey, Pratt,
can you spare Jane?

04:01.008 --> 04:03.043
Definitely.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.313
Document everything we do
at the time we do it.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.980
Isn't that usually
a nurse's job?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.616
There's a nursing shortage,
Jane-- haven't you heard?

04:08.649 --> 04:10.017
What are you doing? Stop!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.719
Hey, hey,
hey, now.
Okay. I may not

04:11.752 --> 04:13.421
always know
what to write.
We'll tell you.

04:13.454 --> 04:17.024
Start with two liters of
02 at 11:25. Pulse ox 98.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.526
Ow.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.394
That's my bag.
Gimme my bag back.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.795
I'll give you your bag back
right down here.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.331
Get your hands
off of me!

04:23.364 --> 04:24.598
Hey!
Calm down.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.733
Knock it off.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.335
Okay? We're here
to help you,

04:27.368 --> 04:28.736
and we can try this

04:28.769 --> 04:30.604
the nice way,
or we can try other options.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.072
This is how you help?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.073
Yeah, that's
right, sir.
Okay.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.676
EEG is ten
centimeters.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.478
EEG's printing.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.612
Chart it.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.348
11:26.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.515
Got your line.
What do you want sent?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.883
KOVAC:
Abby?

04:42.916 --> 04:47.888
CBC, chem 20, PT/PTT,
troponin. Type and hold.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.390
And add a serum ammonia.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.391
EKG looks good.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.725
Hey.
No ischemic
changes.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.427
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.528
Hey.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.563
Hey!!

04:57.130 --> 04:59.066
My name is Charlie.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.067
Metcalf, okay?

05:03.371 --> 05:04.738
Okay?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.440
Okay.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.608
Okay?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.377
Okay.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.879
Ouch! Don't.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.914
Okay, okay. I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

05:13.947 --> 05:14.948
Dr. Kovac.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.417
Okay, let's get him gowned.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.851
We need you to work
with us, Mr. Metcalf.

05:17.885 --> 05:22.122
This'll be
much easier, okay?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.391
What's the trouble?

05:23.391 --> 05:26.560
Possible extensor tendon lac.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.530
Okay. Can you move your
toes up and down?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.831
How'd that happen?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.534
My sister pulled
the television down on me.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.636
It was an accident.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.970
I guess it's true,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.072
then, huh? TV really is
bad for kids.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.741
KOVAC:
Where were your parents?

05:40.774 --> 05:41.875
JEREMY:
My dad was at work.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.511
KOVAC:
Baby-sitter?

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
We can't afford one.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.046
I watch after Steffie.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.080
Can't afford
a baby-sitter,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.482
but they got
one big-ass TV.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.583
Luka.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.884
Somebody called the dad?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.420
Yeah, the neighbor
who brought them in.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.423
Get him cleaned up
and send for X rays.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.926
We have three TVs.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.561
That IV making you feel better?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.631
Yeah. Yeah, look,
before-- I-I'm sorry.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.533
I-I just...
Shh.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.636
11:27. 300 cc bolus is in.
Pulse down to 110.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.770
No murmur rubs

06:09.803 --> 06:11.872
or gallops. Multiple
spider angiomas

06:11.905 --> 06:13.040
on the chest wall.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.475
Watch my stomach.
Watch my...

06:14.508 --> 06:15.609
( Metcalf coughs )

06:15.643 --> 06:16.777
You seen a
doctor lately?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.112
Um, it's been a
of couple years.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.114
Do you have
a primary-care physician?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.783
No, not at the present time.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.151
Need a 5-O nylon.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.986
( groans )

06:26.019 --> 06:28.121
Who were you seeing
a couple of years ago?

06:28.155 --> 06:29.723
I don't remember the guy's name.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.692
Some doctor in Taylorville.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.894
Taylorville? You lived there?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.163
Yeah.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.798
There's a prison
there, right?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.533
Yeah, it's
a correctional facility.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.868
What's the big deal?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.836
I knew somebody
who spent time there once.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.071
Small world.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.939
Positive fluid wave.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.908
Liver's small.
JANE:
Ascites?

06:47.941 --> 06:48.909
Yeah.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.478
What's that?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.680
It means you have fluid
in your belly.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.914
So, what were you in for?

06:53.947 --> 06:56.584
A mistake.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.718
What, you mean
you weren't framed?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.019
Spleen is enlarged.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.989
Chart a BP. 100/70 at...

07:02.022 --> 07:02.990
11:28.

07:03.023 --> 07:03.991
Caput medusa.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.058
What kind of mistake?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.795
I killed a guy.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.163
Palmar erythema
and muscle atrophy.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.999
Oh, yeah? For what?

07:12.032 --> 07:15.168
For asking too many damn
questions, that's for what.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.739
Hemocue 7.2

07:18.772 --> 07:20.708
My dad here yet?

07:20.741 --> 07:21.742
No, not yet.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.511
Hey, kid!

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
Don't look at him.
Just look this way, okay?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.046
Hey, pally.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.080
Don't worry about him.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.782
Mr. Metcalf?
What?

07:28.816 --> 07:29.883
Mr. Metcalf?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.585
You're very anemic
and could be

07:31.619 --> 07:33.554
losing blood
from an ulcer.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.122
Are you a drinker?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.757
( laughs ):
Yeah.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.891
Were you drinking
in jail?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.026
Yeah, but you're
not gonna rat me

07:39.059 --> 07:40.728
to my parole board,
are you darling?

07:40.761 --> 07:43.230
It's important we know
what you've been taking.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.866
Pruno, breakfast of felons.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.269
Now, I drink wine, beer,
anything I can get my hands on.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.738
Pruno?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.640
Yeah, it's fruit... ow.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.242
fruit and bread
from the cafeteria.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.810
You put it in
a garbage bag

07:56.844 --> 07:58.979
with toilet water and
then you let it ferment.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.180
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.214
Ferment where?

08:01.248 --> 08:02.583
Under the bed.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.717
Strain it through
your socks

08:03.751 --> 08:05.919
and then you're ready to go.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.921
If you're desperate enough,
it tastes like a martini.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.823
Oh, yeah?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.959
Yeah. You don't know
what it's like to need a drink.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.927
I can imagine.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.228
Okay. To check
for blood loss,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.264
we're going to have
to do a rectal exam.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.567
A what? No, no, no, no, no.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.869
I spent the last nine years
avoiding rectals. No.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.136
It's the only way
for me to know

08:23.170 --> 08:24.772
that there's any
gastrointestinal...

08:24.805 --> 08:26.039
You're gonna stick
your finger up my ass?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.776
My gloved
and lubricated finger, yeah.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.578
No.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.712
I'm sure it's smaller
than your bowel movements.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.914
Listen, boss-- exit
only. You understand?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.917
Exit only.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.219
If you're bleeding internally,
it could be life-threatening.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.594
Okay. fine.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.162
Can I...? Maybe we can
cover me up or something.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.831
JEREMY:
I don't want it.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.100
Would I hurt you?
No! I don't want it!

08:53.133 --> 08:54.802
Look at me, I'm not going
to hurt you, okay?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.803
I want my dad!

08:55.836 --> 08:56.804
You don't
have to worry.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.138
Where's my dad?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.640
Look at me, I'm not
going to hurt you, okay?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.142
I want my dad!
I don't want to get a shot!

09:02.175 --> 09:03.243
Look at me. I'm not gonna

09:03.276 --> 09:05.178
hurt you, okay?
Pally?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.253
What's your name?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.222
Jeremy.

09:15.255 --> 09:19.059
Jeremy, you know,
the way I see it,

09:19.092 --> 09:20.961
doctors are mean.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.195
They wanna make us cry,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.997
but you know what?

09:24.031 --> 09:27.635
If you don't, I won't.
What do you say?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
Let's show 'em.
Let's both not cry.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.075
Okay, kid?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.143
Okay, Jeremy.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.348
It's okay.
It's okay. It's all right.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.651
See?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.019
( groaning )

09:46.053 --> 09:47.287
That's it.
Don't worry

09:47.320 --> 09:48.355
It's okay.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.389
There it is.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.824
Get that. That's it.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.993
See? Hey, that wasn't
bad, was it?

09:55.663 --> 09:58.666
We have to put a tube down your
nose into your stomach

09:58.666 --> 10:00.868
to figure out
what's causing the bleeding.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.870
No, the docs in the joint
gave me one of those

10:02.903 --> 10:04.672
for my pancreatitis.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.273
We're going to numb it up
so it won't be too bad.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.041
Great.
We won't keep
the tube in

10:08.075 --> 10:10.277
any longer
than necessary, okay?

10:10.310 --> 10:13.246
Sit him up.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.148
( groans )

10:15.182 --> 10:16.416
You know, I used
to be an artist.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.251
Open.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.121
Pressure's up
to 110/76.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.322
What kind of artist?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.758
I-I did some painting.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.894
A mural for my wife's church,

10:26.927 --> 10:28.395
You know.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.899
Mostly I, uh, I earned
my living as a contractor,

10:31.932 --> 10:35.102
a carpenter-- that sort of
thing-- fixing old places up.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.304
You all could use
my help around here.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.772
Okay, if you swallow it
while we pass it,

10:38.806 --> 10:40.073
it'll go down easier.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.942
All right, all right, all right.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.047
Okay.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.983
It's going down.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.219
Keep swallowing. It's
going down. That's good.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.655
Very good.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.958
All set.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.959
Relax.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.728
Okay. Hook it up to low suction.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.896
Yeah, I was mixed up before.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.032
I get confused in my head.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.267
I-I-I'm better now.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.137
Like you think you're
going on a trip?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.805
When you were in
the waiting room,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.874
you kept asking me what
time your flight was.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.743
Sometimes it's a train or a bus.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.878
Sometimes it's a boat.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.748
One time, I was
getting ready to parachute.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.449
So is that what the
suitcase is all about?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.251
No, I always
have that.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.886
You leave anything
behind at the flop,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.287
it won't be there
when you get back.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.989
The scumbags steal it.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.326
NG output one liter at 11:32.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.029
KOVAC:
Blood's too dark for an ulcer.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.064
Varices?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.932
What's that?

11:38.966 --> 11:41.769
That's when the elevated
pressure in your liver backs up.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.003
KOVAC:
The veins
of the esophagus

11:43.036 --> 11:44.471
become engorged and fragile

11:44.504 --> 11:46.774
and can bleed a lot,
sometimes uncontrollably.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.144
Emesis basin!

11:56.850 --> 11:59.019
Oh, you made me worse. Get...

11:59.052 --> 12:00.120
Get it out of me.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.421
Mr. Metcalf.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.823
Get it out!

12:02.856 --> 12:03.991
Okay.

12:04.024 --> 12:04.992
That has to stay in.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.326
Get it out of me!

12:06.359 --> 12:07.961
Okay, soft restraints.
Get the tube out.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.363
Pressure's dropping,
82/66, tachy at 130.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.431
Another liter and two units

12:11.464 --> 12:13.233
of type-specific,
and call G.I.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.002
down here now.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.369
Get these off. ( stammering )

12:16.403 --> 12:17.938
Trauma One
is open.
Okay.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.340
Mr. Metcalf, is there anyone
we can call for you?

12:20.373 --> 12:21.842
You mentioned you had a wife.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.543
No.
Children,
siblings?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.345
No. No. Nobody that'll come.
Okay, let's get him

12:25.378 --> 12:27.014
up to X ray.
Stef, you stay with him.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.481
Okay, sweetie? I'll see you
back here in an hour.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.850
Pratt, with us.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.118
Make it four units
type-specific.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.285
Type-specific'll take too long.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.887
Get O-neg out
of the cooler!

12:33.921 --> 12:35.355
Get these things off me.
Don't tie me down!

12:35.388 --> 12:37.891
You can't keep
tying me down!

12:37.925 --> 12:39.492
Let's go, people.
Prime the rapid infuser.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.861
Subclavian
on the right?

12:40.894 --> 12:41.829
Yeah. Prep the chest.

12:43.163 --> 12:43.997
Let's go, people.
Prime the rapid infuser.

12:44.031 --> 12:44.865
Subclavian on the right.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.498
Prepping the chest.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.200
O-neg here.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.870
Squeeze in the first units.
Sam, second on the infuser.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.904
Pratt...

12:50.938 --> 12:52.439
Push the octreotide

12:52.472 --> 12:53.841
You've been paying
attention, huh?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.242
You need me
to do something?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.277
Yes, cycle the dynamap
when it's ready.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.213
A little sandostatin's
not going to make his
chances any better.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.548
Diminished blood flow
through the portal system.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.116
Yeah, but what's the point?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.018
The odds of him making it
are what, 30%?

13:05.052 --> 13:07.054
Another 200cc's
out the NG tube.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.356
He's that sick,
even though he was
just lucid and talking?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.390
He's right on the edge.
All he needs is a little push.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.591
You know what, Pratt?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.993
We got a lot
of hands in here.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.127
If you don't
want to help...

13:14.161 --> 13:15.495
So you want
attending now?

13:15.528 --> 13:16.529
What, no one wants
to be a nurse anymore?

13:16.563 --> 13:17.530
Pratt, come on.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.565
Prick.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.067
That's enough.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.368
Heart rate's up
to 140.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.903
Is he taking any meds?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.238
Check his bag. He said all his
stuff is in there.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.539
First unit's up.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.607
11:35.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.211
Pushing 15 mikes of octreotide.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.046
All right.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.547
The guide wire's
passing.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.383
Yo, hair of the dog.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.951
151 proof.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.152
This guy's a class act.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.353
Where are you with
your extension tubing?

13:40.387 --> 13:41.922
What is your
problem, Pratt?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.991
We're killing ourselves
for a non-compliant

13:44.024 --> 13:47.094
alcoholic, ex-con drifter
with end-stage liver failure.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.896
You want to get out?!
Then get out!

13:50.563 --> 13:52.933
You know what? It's Friday.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.501
I don't do lost causes
on Friday.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.403
It's a religious thing.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.540
Second unit's going in.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.909
Is there anything else
in that bag

14:01.909 --> 14:03.110
we need to know about?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.611
No, but there's a picture.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.147
It looks like him
and his wife and a kid maybe.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.917
A bunch of letters
and a journal.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.953
Pressure's 98 over 62
at 11:37.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.254
I don't know.
Some kind of painting.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.623
Where's my passport...?

14:16.656 --> 14:17.624
Where's your what?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.126
Give me my passport.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.593
I can't go without my shoes.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.929
Go where, Mr...?

14:21.962 --> 14:22.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.997
Let me, let me go.
Let me go.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.032
Head up to 20 degrees.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.066
Let me go.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.167
And check on G.I.
again.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.301
Let me go. Thank you.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.436
I'll be right back.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.437
Get 'em off.
Get 'em off.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.276
Do you have
a problem with me?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.310
No.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.312
Sam?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.048
I was out of line.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.150
Okay, let's go.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.284
The guy's a waste.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.155
Dying from something
that he's doing to himself.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.223
Last time I checked,
alcoholism was still a disease.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.992
So is suicide.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.660
He should catch some of that
and save us the trouble.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.563
We get ones
like this every day.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.031
Then maybe I need
a day off.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.569
This personal?

15:02.602 --> 15:04.437
I guess.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.672
Good.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.474
You and I have
to talk about it.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.342
You like riding me, don't you?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.144
I don't think I do.
Ever since I was
an intern

15:11.178 --> 15:12.545
you've been on my back.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.546
Maybe a couple of times.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.982
Why?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.686
You're good, Pratt,
but I think you could be better.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.260
There's a number
you wrote down here
with a name.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.329
"Bobby?" Should we
call him, Charlie?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.698
No. No, don't call him,
please.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.467
I don't want anybody
to call him, okay?

15:34.501 --> 15:37.037
No calling.
I-I don't want to see him.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.071
I don't want to see him!

15:38.105 --> 15:40.240
Mr. Metcalf, the veins

15:40.273 --> 15:42.675
at the end of your esophagus
are bleeding a lot.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.578
This is a result
of your cirrhosis.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.215
That also means
you have less than

15:48.248 --> 15:53.186
50% chance of surviving.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.025
This is surviving
for how long?

15:58.058 --> 16:01.761
A few months?
Months? Months? What?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.663
Not that long.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.665
PRATT:
What we need to know is
if you stop breathing

16:05.698 --> 16:07.234
or your heart gives out,

16:07.267 --> 16:10.703
do you want us
to use heroic measures?

16:16.276 --> 16:17.710
Heroic what?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.746
You want us to do CPR,
shock your heart

16:19.779 --> 16:21.148
or put you on
a breathing machine?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.283
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.119
You saying now?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.721
You're, you're saying now,
you mean like, today?

16:31.424 --> 16:32.659
No, no, no.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.294
Look, no, I have
a lot of things

16:34.327 --> 16:35.328
that I have to do.
I'm just not ready.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.696
Okay.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.132
I'm not ready. I'm, I'm...

16:39.166 --> 16:42.269
Okay, the man wants it all.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.436
Okay.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.078
I'm Adler from G.I. How bad?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.280
About 21/////2 liters of output.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.749
Pre-load the scope
with a Saeed six-shooter.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.351
What? What's a six-shooter?

16:58.385 --> 17:00.487
We're going to look
down your esophagus

17:00.520 --> 17:02.755
and try to band the veins
to stop the bleeding.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.223
What's the deal
with your suction?

17:04.257 --> 17:05.224
Turn it up.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.526
I did.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.127
Nothing's coming
out, great.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.729
Check in two, Abby?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.397
Jane, get on the phone
about a portable unit.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.432
You guys have suction
in here?

17:12.464 --> 17:13.500
Last time I checked.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.501
What time is it?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.236
11:40. Why?

17:16.269 --> 17:18.305
They got 23 minutes,
or we're eating for free.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.339
Is your patient stable?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.807
Smoke inhalation
with wheezing.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.840
Okay, we need the room.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.242
You into pepperoni, Abby?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.212
Do you have ADD?
Come on! Let's go.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.512
Give us two minutes
to finish the...

17:26.546 --> 17:27.847
We need it now, Ray.
We're good in here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.349
This guy may just need
to be tubed.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.351
This guy might need
to be pronounced.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.686
I hope you're not a veggie,
'cause I got meat on everything.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.721
See you later.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.492
Cetacaine and bite block.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.294
A little more
numbing spray,
Charlie.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.264
Push two of versed.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.600
All right, Charlie,
once we're ready to start,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.369
you're going to have to keep
this in between your teeth

17:49.402 --> 17:50.537
because it stops you
from biting down

17:50.570 --> 17:51.604
on the fiber-optic scope.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.672
Check your monitor.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.842
Is this Bobby, Charlie?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.144
Is that your son?

17:57.177 --> 17:59.479
Yeah.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.647
And your wife?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.681
Evelyn.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.815
Pretty.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.484
You want me to call her?

18:04.517 --> 18:09.156
No, she's gone.
It's been a long time.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.323
What about Bobby?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.491
Must be all grown up
by now, huh?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.193
Yeah, he's 19.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.594
He's going to be 20 next month.
He's in college.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.698
Let's try
to reach him, okay?

18:18.731 --> 18:21.168
I haven't talked to him
since he was little.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.836
His aunt gave me that number
when I got out of prison, but...

18:23.870 --> 18:26.839
Well, it's all
the more reason
to use it now.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.445
Let's pull the NG.

18:32.479 --> 18:37.517
Okay, Charlie,
here we go.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.224
( Charlie coughs )

18:46.959 --> 18:48.195
( grunting )

18:51.431 --> 18:52.932
How's his pressure?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.334
108 over 58.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.668
Okay, ready to go.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.904
Hi, I'm looking
for Bobby Metcalf?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.609
Okay. You know what?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
Can you actually
wake him up for me?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.318
( coughs )

19:11.351 --> 19:13.720
Hi, Bobby, my name
is Samantha Taggart.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.922
I'm an ER nurse at
the County General
in Chicago.

19:15.955 --> 19:16.923
Grade-two varices?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.458
Grade three.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.861
Yeah, we have your father here,
and, uh... Yeah.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.363
And he's pretty sick.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.232
Four columns,
two hemorrhagic.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.368
Two bands at each bleeding site,
one at the others.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.903
SAM:
Uh, no, he's, well,
he's out of jail.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.674
I don't know.
For a while, I think.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.809
Systolic's down to 90.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.810
Is there any way
you can come down here

19:37.844 --> 19:39.246
and be with him?

19:39.279 --> 19:42.849
Probably the versed.
500cc saline bolus.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.651
Uh, no. You know what.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.621
He can't talk right now
because he's in a procedure.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.424
Sucking the varix into the cap.

19:51.458 --> 19:55.495
Okay, hold on.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.897
He wants to talk to you.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.667
Sorry. That needs
to stay in.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.337
And...

20:04.371 --> 20:05.705
firing.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.978
Okay, let's talk.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.550
Okay, you guys,
I'm gonna put Mr.
Metcalf's son

20:17.584 --> 20:18.918
on the phone
for a minute, okay?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.758
( son breathing into phone )

20:29.362 --> 20:31.964
Bobby?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.266
Dad?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.602
Is it you?

20:35.635 --> 20:39.939
Yeah... it's me.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.608
So you're sick huh? You dying?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.576
No, no, no, no.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.445
Nurse, is he dying?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.447
He's very sick.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.586
What am I supposed to say...

20:53.620 --> 20:55.455
huh, Dad?

20:57.390 --> 20:59.892
It's been a long time,
There's so many things I...

20:59.926 --> 21:00.960
Yeah?

21:00.993 --> 21:04.931
I don't know. I...

21:08.735 --> 21:09.736
Hey, Dad?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.405
Yeah?

21:12.439 --> 21:13.840
Nice knowing you.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.343
( receiver clicks )

21:22.582 --> 21:25.785
( sobbing )

21:40.032 --> 21:41.968
I told you you
shouldn't call him.

21:44.771 --> 21:45.805
Firing.

21:46.773 --> 21:47.907
Good.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.975
Turn up my section.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.009
Can you band it?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.711
Not if I can't see it.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.613
Mr. Metcalf?
Mr. Metcalf?

21:53.646 --> 21:54.681
BP 62 over 38.

21:54.714 --> 21:55.948
I can't even feel
a pulse.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.017
Bobby?

21:58.718 --> 21:59.752
Bobby?!

22:01.954 --> 22:03.390
( whistles )

22:03.423 --> 22:04.457
Bobby?!

22:04.491 --> 22:06.092
He's bleeding out.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.760
Okay, turn him over.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.397
Another two units
on the infuser. Ambu-bag!

22:10.430 --> 22:11.631
( birds chirping )

22:11.664 --> 22:13.433
Come on in. The water's warm.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.003
Try the femoral.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.438
Get another
four units up here.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.906
FFP after these two!

22:19.939 --> 22:22.875
Hey! Hey, you dumb son
of a bitch!

22:24.911 --> 22:26.078
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!

22:36.556 --> 22:38.425
Thought we lost you
there for a second.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.796
Bobby?

22:43.830 --> 22:47.500
Uh, we had him on the phone.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.569
Is he coming?

22:49.602 --> 22:52.939
No. No, he's not coming, man.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.142
JANE:
BP's 86/42 at 11:44.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.844
ABBY:
You want the FFP?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.779
PRATT
Yeah, and another unit
of packed cells.

22:59.812 --> 23:00.780
Dr. Kovac.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.725
How long have you been
out of touch with him?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.126
Your son.

23:14.160 --> 23:19.632
Long time.
Since I went to prison.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.001
Well, even in prison,
he's still your kid.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.737
Blood's here.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.606
You don't know what it's like.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.974
I know if I had a kid,
I'd want to do

23:28.007 --> 23:29.876
everything I could
to stay with him.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.746
KOVAC:
I need a Linton tube,
Kelly and a 60cc syringe.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.748
You think you know,
but you don't.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.586
How it could all
switch on you.

23:43.122 --> 23:47.226
How life could
turn on a dime.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.497
Gets broke and you can't s...

23:50.497 --> 23:52.499
you can't see a way to fix it.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.133
KOVAC:
Mr. Metcalf,

23:54.166 --> 23:56.035
the specialist,
uh, here thinks

23:56.068 --> 23:57.870
we can control
your breathing
with the scope.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.138
ABBY:
So you want a Linton tube?

23:59.171 --> 24:00.740
METCALF:
Wha... What?

24:00.773 --> 24:04.511
We pass a large balloon
into your stomach.

24:04.511 --> 24:08.515
So it helps us keep pressure
on your veins.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.818
All right, well,
what's to lose?

24:11.851 --> 24:13.786
I'll test the balloon.

24:15.121 --> 24:19.826
IT was April 10, 1992.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.031
Bobby was turning eight.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.802
My wife asked me to go get
some stuff for the party,

24:31.003 --> 24:32.171
but I... I-I st...

24:32.204 --> 24:33.773
I stayed so I could finish

24:33.806 --> 24:36.576
putting together
this robot for him.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.845
You know, so I made her go.

24:38.878 --> 24:42.715
From the street,
I hear a thud...

24:42.749 --> 24:46.886
and the scream.

24:46.919 --> 24:50.757
And I go to the window
to look out.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.126
And... and she's...
she's lying there

24:54.160 --> 24:56.896
like she's asleep
on the street.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.898
And the ice cream cake...

24:58.931 --> 25:02.168
the ice cream cake was
all around her on the pavement.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.804
SAM:
Five syringes.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.006
So there I am,
there I am with this...

25:07.039 --> 25:09.909
with this little boy to raise.

25:09.942 --> 25:13.846
And what do I do?

25:13.880 --> 25:16.248
I start drinking...

25:16.282 --> 25:18.651
and getting high.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.792
I couldn't keep it together.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.694
I couldn't keep
it together.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.098
And then I stabbed some guy
in a bar,

25:32.131 --> 25:35.034
Just for... just for...

25:35.067 --> 25:37.604
just for nothing.

25:37.604 --> 25:38.838
For nothing.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.074
'Cause he looked at me wrong.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.843
SAM:
This one's good.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.914
KOVAC:
We can go up to 750
for hemostasis.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.115
Okay, ready,
Mr. Metcalf?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.660
( coughs )

26:00.693 --> 26:01.928
( gagging, coughing )

26:01.961 --> 26:03.896
( coughing )

26:06.265 --> 26:08.801
( gags )

26:08.835 --> 26:10.937
( gagging continues )

26:12.772 --> 26:15.975
KOVAC:
So, where was your son
after that?

26:16.008 --> 26:17.777
With my wife's folks.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.379
Listen for bowel sounds.

26:20.412 --> 26:25.217
METCALF:
At first, they would bring him
by on visiting days, but...

26:25.251 --> 26:28.855
after a while that stopped.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.223
And then the letters started
coming back unopened.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.859
You know what?

26:32.892 --> 26:35.828
I-I-I-I don't feel good.
Something's wrong.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.229
Something's wrong.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.032
BUN 74, creatinine 8.2.

26:40.066 --> 26:43.035
Okay, call renal
and throw in a Foley.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.037
Hey, we should think about TIPS.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.706
What's that?

26:46.739 --> 26:48.374
KOVAC:
TIPS stands for
Trans-jugular

26:48.407 --> 26:50.242
Inter-hepatic
Porta-systemic Shunt.

26:50.276 --> 26:54.847
Uh, we put a catheter
from your neck to your belly.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.784
By bridging the two vessels,
we can bypass the liver

26:57.817 --> 26:59.318
and slow down the bleeding.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.387
And how much time
would that give me?

27:01.420 --> 27:04.023
It's hard to say.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.025
No urine output.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.127
ABBY:
Hepatorenal syndrome.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.262
Your... your kidneys
are not working.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.264
ABBY:
He needs dialysis.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.366
PRATT
I'll make the call.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.968
RAY:
GSW to the belly.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.837
KOVAC:
Not here, Chuny.
There's nowhere else.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.239
'Kay, move him over,
and keep traction
on the Linton.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.775
Hold on.
'Kay, go ahead.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.944
KOVAC:
Okay, let's transfer him.
One, two, three.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.079
RAY:
There's no meds,

27:27.113 --> 27:29.081
no allergies, no past history.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.083
NG, Foley
and portable chest.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.952
Bastard shot me
for stealing my own spliff.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.320
I need another nurse in here.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.822
Said it was his,
but it was mine.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.356
Rolled it myself
this morning.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.726
What's going on?
They just need
to stabilize him.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.260
I want my own
damn room!

27:41.293 --> 27:42.328
Get the hell out
of here, man!

27:42.361 --> 27:43.763
Screw you, jerk-off.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.865
KOVAC:
Okay, doctors only
talking now.

27:45.898 --> 27:46.933
Damn, that's hard.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.467
Even a gunshot wound
to the belly

27:48.500 --> 27:50.903
don't buy a man
some privacy.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.172
Ow!
KOVAC:
'Kay, two grams of Cefoxitin

27:53.205 --> 27:55.808
I.V. piggyback.
That's a house

27:55.842 --> 27:58.344
we rented one summer.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.345
There was a lake nearby.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.781
I-I took Bobby fishing...

28:01.814 --> 28:04.416
Periumbilical GSW
with intestinal prolapse.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.218
DUBENKO:
Hey, what about
the on-deck batter?

28:06.252 --> 28:08.020
We're waiting
for a TIPS and IR.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.122
DUBENKO:
That sounds bad.
Let's get him up for an ex-lap.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.958
Portable monitor, let's go.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.125
KOVAC:
What about X rays?

28:13.159 --> 28:14.761
DUBENKO:
We'll get them upstairs.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.228
RAY:
T minus eleven minutes
on those pizzas.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.099
PRATT:
IR's already on the floor,

28:20.132 --> 28:22.168
and Renal's on the way.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.271
Luka, he's getting tremulous.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.774
Haven't had a drink
since last night.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.008
It's alcohol withdrawal.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.977
Who's Dr. Pratt?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.144
Hey, that'd be me.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.780
Hey. Ramirez, nephrology.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.014
All right, who's this guy?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.248
We're gonna need
central access.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.050
KOVAC:
He's got a subclavian.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.786
That's great, let's consent him
and start the run.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.387
What? What is he talking about?

28:41.420 --> 28:44.423
He's here for
the dialysis that
we discussed.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.826
I never discussed it.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.427
You discussed it.
I never... I never

28:48.460 --> 28:49.896
discussed it.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.898
Alfonso,
how are you?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.065
Is this a TIPS patient?

28:53.099 --> 28:54.433
Yeah, and we
should go first.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.002
Uh, wha... wh-what
are you talking about?

28:56.035 --> 28:57.269
That's what's gonna
prolong his life.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.171
RAMIREZ:
Yeah, without the dialysis,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.107
he'll bleed out the minute
you spike through his liver.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.509
What? What? Spike my liver?

29:03.542 --> 29:06.813
Will his pressure
even tolerate dialysis if
the varices keep bleeding?

29:06.813 --> 29:08.214
I-I don't understand.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.916
I can support
his pressure.
The Linton tube

29:09.949 --> 29:11.550
is supporting his pressure,
and only barely.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.820
Wh-What are you
talking about?
Dr. Kovac.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.222
Well, he's gonna need dialysis
three times a week.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.423
Yeah, for the rest
of his life.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.091
Hey... hey...
TIPS is not a cure.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.559
It's a bridge to
a liver transplant.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.362
We all know that's
not gonna happen.
Hey, hey,

29:23.395 --> 29:24.396
hey, hey.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.299
I'm right here.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.168
Yeah.
Talk to me.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.469
Sorry.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.575
Now, you can't fix my kidneys?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.111
You're gonna need dialysis,

29:39.145 --> 29:42.148
three times a week.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.251
And what about my liver problem
and the... and the bleeding?

29:45.284 --> 29:47.019
The TIPS is
a temporary measure.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.588
Your best hope is for
a liver transplant.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.891
I-I-I don't understand.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.861
Wh-Wh-What are the odds of that?

29:54.861 --> 29:56.062
KOVAC:
Based on your history
of drinking,

29:56.095 --> 29:57.196
not good.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.267
Is there... is there any chance

30:01.300 --> 30:03.970
that I'm gonna be walking
out of here?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.272
With the dialysis
and the TIPS...

30:06.305 --> 30:08.207
METCALF:
I mean today.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.945
What are the chances that I'm
gonna walk out of here today?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.113
None.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.191
I-I-I don't want it.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.429
I don't want anything, then.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.098
If you don't have
the TIPS procedure,

30:32.131 --> 30:33.632
we can't control the bleeding--
you'll die.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.901
Yeah, I get it.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.469
I get it.

30:39.038 --> 30:42.008
Just stop everything.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.242
No more
blood transfusions?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.243
No breathing machine?
No, it's over.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.644
No CPR?
No.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.947
I need it to be very clear,
Charlie--

30:47.980 --> 30:50.582
if we don't continue
with the treatment,

30:50.616 --> 30:51.984
do you understand
what will happen?

30:55.254 --> 30:57.890
Yeah.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.027
Yeah.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.504
Okay, Mr. Metcalf is a DNR.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.176
11:57.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.510
Wait, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.346
Hey, he's not competent.
Come on.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.581
It's what he wants, Pratt.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.651
Can you, uh...

31:25.684 --> 31:29.555
can you do something for this?

31:29.588 --> 31:32.358
Hey, could we put him
on an alcohol drip.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.493
You gonna get me drunk?
Just enough to stop

31:34.526 --> 31:35.995
the tremors, Charlie.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.496
Charlie,
let us do the procedure.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.431
You don't have to do this.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.700
Just call...
could you, um...

31:41.733 --> 31:44.103
try Bobby again.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.538
Try my boy, get
him on the phone.

31:46.572 --> 31:50.176
If he knows it's really over,
he'll come.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.543
Okay? He'll come.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.659
TAGGART:
Hey. Bobby Metcalf...?

32:09.996 --> 32:12.398
Oh, yeah.
It's the hospital calling again.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.566
Yeah, do you think
you could do that?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.069
Okay, thank you.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.104
What happened?

32:18.137 --> 32:19.538
He went to class.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.009
His roommate's going
to see if he can find him.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.010
Can you take this out?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.144
It's uncomfortable.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.412
That tube's keeping you alive.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.546
It's uncomfortable. Please.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.684
Okay.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.121
Is there, um...
is-is there a window?

32:35.154 --> 32:37.556
Can you open a window
and get some fresh air in here?

32:37.589 --> 32:39.291
Please?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.260
Sam.
Please.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.597
All right.
Here we go.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.036
That's right,
blow it out.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.037
( gags and coughs )

32:51.037 --> 32:52.371
( gagging )

32:59.245 --> 33:00.312
( passing traffic )

33:00.346 --> 33:03.115
( people chattering )

33:03.149 --> 33:05.584
( distant music playing )

33:13.225 --> 33:14.726
What is that, Lincoln Street?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.228
Harrison.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.663
I worked here over a year,
and I never even

33:17.696 --> 33:20.166
thought about
what's outside that window.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.068
I've worked here six.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.806
It's from the tube.
I'll take care of it.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.542
Ten percent ethanol
at 100cc's an hour.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.580
You know, your booze works fast.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.082
Mad Dog IV, just for you.

33:38.084 --> 33:41.620
All this stuff, you know,

33:41.653 --> 33:44.756
it's just blinders.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.626
It's just a screen.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.361
I don't want anything
separating me

33:49.395 --> 33:53.332
from what's happening.

33:53.365 --> 33:57.236
I'm not gonna run and hide
from this.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.306
Pulse ox and dynamap
can come off.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.109
Last sat's 92.

34:05.377 --> 34:09.447
My brother Lou died...

34:09.481 --> 34:13.119
when we were kids.

34:19.725 --> 34:23.629
My mom, she said...

34:23.661 --> 34:25.630
Oh...

34:32.438 --> 34:36.342
She said, "Charlie, Lou's
gone away on a long trip."

34:42.880 --> 34:45.184
Don't you just
leave me here.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.154
I want to see a doctor now.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.563
Last B.P.'s 90/60.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.399
When is my turn, huh?!

35:00.432 --> 35:04.670
When's it going to
be my turn?! Huh?!

35:04.703 --> 35:06.405
People!

35:06.438 --> 35:08.174
When is it?!

35:08.207 --> 35:10.276
When is my turn?!

35:28.760 --> 35:30.696
170...

35:30.729 --> 35:34.300
91...

35:34.333 --> 35:35.867
What are you saying?

35:35.901 --> 35:36.902
It's your vitals.

35:40.606 --> 35:41.907
Is it starting?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.909
What, Charlie?

35:43.942 --> 35:45.444
Am I going?

35:48.547 --> 35:49.681
It's starting.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.884
Don't you people
have a system?

35:52.918 --> 35:54.653
Isn't there
any method at all?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.590
Don't worry, you won't be alone.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.761
Good.

36:02.794 --> 36:03.929
That's good.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.831
Someone will stay
with you.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.436
Sam, you got this?

36:12.704 --> 36:13.705
Yeah.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.446
Could you, um... touch me?

36:21.347 --> 36:22.881
Sorry?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.485
My face.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.886
Please?

37:04.523 --> 37:05.957
Maybe we should anchor.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.593
What?

37:07.626 --> 37:08.960
Do you think
we should keep going?

37:08.994 --> 37:12.531
I don't know, Charlie.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.434
What about him?

37:15.467 --> 37:17.536
What do you think he wants?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.704
I don't know.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.442
I don't think he knows.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.945
Is it too late?

37:26.978 --> 37:28.947
Not if you don't
want it to be, Charlie.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.483
( papers drop on floor )

37:31.517 --> 37:33.319
Watch it!

37:39.525 --> 37:40.992
Oh, no.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.495
Oh, no.

37:43.529 --> 37:47.032
Oh, no.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.335
( tapping )

37:50.536 --> 37:52.871
I feel drunk again.

37:52.904 --> 37:53.905
Yeah.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.475
Thank you.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.977
Okay, Mr. Metcalf,

37:59.010 --> 38:00.779
we're going to keep
a heart monitor on

38:00.812 --> 38:02.648
and the alcohol drip
for comfort.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.383
Okay.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.884
But I'm going to take you
off the octreotide now

38:05.917 --> 38:08.420
which is the last
support measure.

38:08.454 --> 38:11.056
Okay.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.358
It shouldn't be long now.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.959
Okay.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.707
I never believed in God.

38:28.740 --> 38:33.044
That might bite me
in the ass now, huh?

38:33.078 --> 38:34.713
God will get over it.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.481
Do you need this?
Can I take it?

39:09.515 --> 39:10.416
Take it.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.517
Take it.

39:14.886 --> 39:15.854
What?

39:19.090 --> 39:20.792
What can I take?

39:20.826 --> 39:22.093
No, never mind.
Never mind.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.034
What's it going to be like
there?

39:31.637 --> 39:32.771
Peaceful.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.987
Come back.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.456
Charlie.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.125
Charlie...

39:56.462 --> 39:58.697
Get all my stuff?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.632
Oh, yeah.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.133
Yeah.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.904
Make sure he gets it.

40:06.672 --> 40:09.140
I will.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.677
Yeah, and give this to him.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.421
You never knew your dad.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.994
No.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.632
That's too bad.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.104
I don't let it bother me.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.108
I bet it bothers him.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.551
Bobby.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.558
Let me in.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.869
Open up.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.808
Let me in.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.583
BOBBY ( whispering ):
Charlie, can you hear me?

42:03.722 --> 42:06.157
Charlie, can you hear me?

42:10.629 --> 42:12.598
( quietly ):
Hey, pally.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.667
You made it.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.172
Uh, how do I look?

42:21.206 --> 42:23.675
( whispering ):
You look okay.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.615
I'm so sorry.

42:36.855 --> 42:39.157
( breath quivering )

42:39.190 --> 42:41.693
I'm so sorry.

42:41.727 --> 42:42.994
( sniffling )

42:44.395 --> 42:48.233
Oh, don't think about that.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.101
Okay?

42:50.135 --> 42:51.937
Just take it easy.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.644
( quietly ):
It's okay... son.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.682
It's...

43:06.084 --> 43:08.019
( heart monitor flatlines )

43:13.692 --> 43:15.260
( sniffles )

43:19.230 --> 43:20.198
Um...

43:20.231 --> 43:22.000
( sniffles )

43:22.033 --> 43:24.002
12:04.

43:27.873 --> 43:29.174
Oh.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.023
( Pratt sniffling )

43:53.264 --> 43:55.200
I'll take that.

43:56.835 --> 43:58.036
( sniffling )

44:02.941 --> 44:04.275
( sighs )

44:08.980 --> 44:11.149
Can someone just
tell me that?

44:11.182 --> 44:12.884
How much longer?

44:12.918 --> 44:14.920
Ma'am, you need
to wait in the room.

44:14.953 --> 44:15.921
Oh.
Let's go.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.355
Well, it's about time.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.157
You been with the same patient
for almost 45 minutes.

44:19.190 --> 44:21.727
Whatever happened to "treat 'em
and street 'em" Pratt?

44:21.760 --> 44:23.261
Do as I say,
not as I do.

44:23.294 --> 44:25.430
All right, well, the TV
kid's back from X ray.

44:25.463 --> 44:27.999
He's in triage with his dad
and his sister.

44:28.033 --> 44:30.201
Things go south?

44:30.235 --> 44:32.771
He was a nice guy.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.472
Just a drunk.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.742
All right, well, there's pizzas
over here if you get hungry.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.177
Got you one with anchovies.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.412
Oh, and the delivery guy
got here at 12:04.

44:41.446 --> 44:43.214
You know what that means?

44:43.248 --> 44:44.850
It means he didn't
make it on time.

44:44.883 --> 44:47.252
No, it means lunch is
on the house, my friend.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.492
Hey, Jeremy,

44:54.525 --> 44:57.295
little man,
back so soon?

45:00.832 --> 45:02.768
How are you doing?
I'm Dr. Pratt.

45:02.768 --> 45:05.103
Yeah, I'm the one
who treated your son.
