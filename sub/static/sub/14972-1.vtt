The little things

03:25.839 --> 03:28.207
I mean, I miss my family
and all that shit, of course,

03:28.209 --> 03:34.846
but... it's just
the little things.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.716
Going to Subway for lunch.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.817
( chuckles )

03:38.819 --> 03:40.886
Double meat on my sandwich,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.387
just 'cause.

03:46.493 --> 03:49.895
I don't know, man.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.665
I'm just talkin',

03:53.667 --> 03:58.837
which you're probably
pretty sick of by now, right?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.372
Hmm.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.408
Yeah, that's ok.

04:03.410 --> 04:07.546
Go ahead.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.183
Yeah, that's it, Doc.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.418
Drink up.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.122
That's good.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.325
I'd be fed up if I was you,
too.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.729
I mean, it's not your fault.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.632
Oh yeah, and Kit Kats.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.134
I miss Kit Kats.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.068
That little chocolate candy

04:30.070 --> 04:31.570
with the cookie thing
in the middle

04:31.572 --> 04:33.538
and it goes snap
when you break 'em.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.307
Click, click, click...

04:35.309 --> 04:38.143
I miss Kit Kats.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.745
Probably a ton of 'em
out there, too,

04:39.747 --> 04:42.981
just sittin' there in stores.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.449
Might as well be on the other

I got this.

What's up with that guy?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.561
That's Sam.

Don't worry about thanking him,

Wendy!

explain it all when we're alone.

Roger that.

You make that Tin-Man

got lost in the fray.

I'm sorry.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.032
What are you talking about?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.099
A woman is stuck out there.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.834
She's gonna get torn apart
by those things!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.769
Opening those doors will
compromise this facility

08:24.771 --> 08:25.804

about our mission.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.705
It's not gonna happen!

08:42.556 --> 08:44.856
Thanks for changing the codes
on that door.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.091
You were gone for six months.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.759
Bastard.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.262
Just be grateful I've still got
the UV lights up and running.

08:55.802 --> 08:58.303
You know, I never even made it
back to the base.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.439
I got cut off, tracked,
chased all over hell.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.974
Hey, the other guys...

09:02.976 --> 09:05.844
Gomez, Smitty...
they make it back?

09:05.846 --> 09:09.648
No.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.983
I should have stayed put.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.185
Yeah, maybe.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.987
What about you?
You been ok here?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.323
Oh, buddy, a barrel of laughs.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.793
Yeah, I bet.

09:21.795 --> 09:22.761
How is she?

09:22.763 --> 09:23.595
Is she still...

09:23.597 --> 09:26.464
Oh yeah, she's
still whatever she is.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.700
Sleeping beauty.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.603
So, just you and the Doc?

09:31.605 --> 09:34.539
This whole time?

09:34.541 --> 09:36.041
( chuckles )

09:36.043 --> 09:37.042
Eh?

09:37.044 --> 09:37.943
You'll see.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.210
Yeah?

09:41.114 --> 09:42.847
I love what you've done
with the place.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.769
It's ok. It's ok.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.237
Is that the doc?

10:39.239 --> 10:40.038
Oh my god.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.539
( snarling )

10:41.541 --> 10:43.274
Yeah, she got bit.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.376
And then I've just been-

10:44.378 --> 10:45.343
Oh, this ought to be good.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.946
She was part of this mission,
too, smart ass.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.614
Wasn't she?

10:49.616 --> 10:50.615
Yeah, but I-

10:50.617 --> 10:51.449
Jesus.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.917
Well alright then.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.919
Anybody touches her,
I'll throw them off the roof.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.920
She's been bit!

10:55.922 --> 10:56.888
She's a vampire!

10:56.890 --> 10:58.390
And what about this chick?

11:01.561 --> 11:03.228
This "chick"...

11:05.599 --> 11:09.501
doesn't exist as far as
you're concerned.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.369
You understand me?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.273
( cocks gun )

11:15.275 --> 11:17.208
I said "do you
understand me"?

11:28.588 --> 11:31.690
Ok then.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.059
That's good.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.480
Do you think we're safe
in here? Huh?

12:28.482 --> 12:31.516
With one of those things pent up
and then some...

12:31.518 --> 12:33.351
I don't even know what,
in that other room, huh?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.652
It's true.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.355
Plus, look how he's treated
John's wife.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.390
I mean, he's an animal.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.391

12:40.393 --> 12:41.626

<i> with a machine gun.</i>

12:44.998 --> 12:46.097

<i> right?</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:49.501
<i> That vampire?</i>

<i> her his own blood.</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:11.890

13:14.761 --> 13:16.561

13:19.032 --> 13:20.732
Come on, man. I'm tryin'.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.069
Ok, great.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.238
Well, look.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.339
I'm sorry about what
happened earlier,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.108
obviously I was a little...

13:30.110 --> 13:33.611
but my wife's out-
out there.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.579
Yeah, she was-

13:34.581 --> 13:35.380
Yeah.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.047
You gotta help me.

13:36.049 --> 13:36.881
At least let me out there.

13:36.883 --> 13:37.882
I don't care what happens
to me, ok?

13:37.884 --> 13:39.751
Really, I don't, but my wife's
stuck out there.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.654
I already told you, we're
not opening those doors again.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.522
It's too dangerous.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.490
It's suicide out there.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.292
You know what it's like,
you've been out there.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.566
Listen to me.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.236
( dishes clatter )

13:58.238 --> 13:59.737
Listen!!!!

13:59.739 --> 14:02.774

14:06.313 --> 14:08.246
Enough! Enough.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.748
Now, I get how you feel,
I do.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.718
But there is nothing
that we can do for her.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.485
Alright!

14:14.487 --> 14:17.488
So we stay inside.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.457
Alright.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.263
End of discussion.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.023
I can't believe the Doc.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.259
She was always...

14:54.261 --> 14:56.027
Yeah.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.366
Six months now.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.502
It happened right when you
and the boys headed out.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.372
What?

15:07.374 --> 15:08.873
I was giving you
covering fire.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.476
She um...

15:11.478 --> 15:12.277
Yeah, no, I remember.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.378
You were up on the roof.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.712
Yeah.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.216
She went down to make sure
the door got shut behind you.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.786
I told her she didn't have
to do it but she insisted.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.022
And then all hell broke loose,

15:24.024 --> 15:27.125
you guys were getting
picked off...

15:27.127 --> 15:31.429
She tried to help Smitty get
back inside and one of them...

15:31.431 --> 15:32.830
got a hold of her.

15:32.832 --> 15:36.768
Took a chunk out of her arm.

15:36.770 --> 15:40.571
She turned right after that.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.341
Damn.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.476
Yeah, pretty much.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.190
It's just-- it's gonna
be a tough sell,

15:59.192 --> 16:00.625
convincing some of those people
to live in the same place

16:00.627 --> 16:02.226
as one of those things.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.296
I'm not convincing nobody
of nothing.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.565
And I never said they
were staying.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.335
That's very true,
you did not.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.437
Look, I'll give you
the door codes later,

16:12.439 --> 16:13.905
a set of keys.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.774
Maybe a couple of the others if
I feel like I can trust them.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.509
Yeah, that's a good idea.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.011
We're gonna need all
the help we can get.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.246
Always something
about acting out.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.082
Especially that John guy.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.522
Don't- watch that there.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.498
And this, this bad
boy's new.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.803
Damn, you're like Robinson
Crusoe or some shit.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.639
How'd you hook up
with that crew?

16:48.641 --> 16:52.844
Hiding in holes in basements,
anywhere you can think of.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.046
You find another frightened fish

16:55.048 --> 16:58.216
and you just decide
to throw in together.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.150
You're running.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.518
Always running.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.854
Ferals, chasing you like
wild animals...

17:02.856 --> 17:04.655
The feeders, smarter...

17:04.657 --> 17:06.591
Tracking you down.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.729
You don't know what
it's like out there.

17:11.731 --> 17:15.400
You have no idea.

17:15.402 --> 17:19.337
A person will do anything
for just one more day.

17:19.339 --> 17:24.575
Anything.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.411
Robinson Crusoe!

17:26.413 --> 17:28.246
Robinson!

17:28.248 --> 17:31.549
( growling )

17:31.551 --> 17:33.851
Now, while they're not here.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.586
Kill the other one, too.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.687
Yeah, let's do it.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.256
Hell yes.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.324
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.125
Back up, people.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.894
This is not a petting zoo.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.295
Who are you supposed
to be? Shaka Zulu?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.963
In charge, that's what.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.899
Until the army guy
comes back.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.867
( growls )

17:49.869 --> 17:51.202
Yeah, that's right.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.171
You're real tough.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.939
Try me, ass face.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.041
Get out of my freakin' way...
now.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.952
Another time.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.197
What?

18:29.476 --> 18:33.611
( low growls )

18:52.065 --> 18:56.000
( growl )

18:56.002 --> 18:58.302
( low growls )

18:58.304 --> 19:07.912
( growling )

20:21.221 --> 20:25.690
( low growl )

20:59.792 --> 21:02.426
Incoming!

21:02.428 --> 21:06.430
( gunfire )

21:06.432 --> 21:07.965
Sam! Sam!

21:07.967 --> 21:09.267
Vampires swarming.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.368
( gunfire )

21:10.370 --> 21:11.969
Let's go!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.308
( fighting grunts )

21:17.310 --> 21:20.978
( screaming and chaos )

21:20.980 --> 21:22.179
( screaming )

21:25.451 --> 21:27.251
( screaming )

21:27.253 --> 21:28.252
Clear!

21:28.254 --> 21:28.653
Clear!

21:28.655 --> 21:30.288
( gun shots )

21:30.290 --> 21:34.959
( fighting grunts )

21:34.961 --> 21:36.527
( gun shots )

21:43.803 --> 21:47.605
( screaming )

21:47.607 --> 21:51.142
( laughing maniacally )

21:51.778 --> 21:54.845
<i> Oh, my god!  Please help me!!!</i>

21:54.847 --> 21:57.682
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.986
I'm sorry!

22:01.988 --> 22:04.522
( sobbing )

22:04.524 --> 22:06.657
I'm sorry!

22:09.329 --> 22:12.430
( convulsing )

22:12.432 --> 22:22.406
( grunts )

22:22.408 --> 22:27.712
( grunts )

22:28.881 --> 22:30.348
Dylan!

22:33.119 --> 22:34.919
( gasping )

22:34.921 --> 22:37.021
Who the hell are you?

23:25.071 --> 23:26.203
Oh.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.938
Oh, god.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.107
That's disgusting.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.542
Oh, Jesus.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.179
I can't believe

23:35.181 --> 23:38.682
you are still dumping them
in there.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.384
Did you wanna go grab
the others?

23:44.490 --> 23:49.894
Ugh!

23:49.896 --> 24:00.905
( sobbing )

24:00.907 --> 24:05.042
Thank you.

24:05.044 --> 24:16.253
( continues to sob )

24:16.255 --> 24:21.292
My parents were in Hawaii with
my brother when it happened.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.761
I was supposed to go, too.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.201
I lied.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.337
Said I had a mid-term.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.005
I was seeing this guy...

24:40.880 --> 24:45.015
( sniffling )

24:45.017 --> 24:48.786
I'm sorry.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.588
I was never like this before.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.122
I was-

24:55.728 --> 24:59.630
I keep trying to get it
together.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.632
But what if I can't?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.239
Nothing broken or busted.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.374
Shit.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.943
They didn't just push
their way in.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.111
At least I don't think
they did.

25:14.113 --> 25:17.648
How many of the others did
you give the codes to this door?

25:17.650 --> 25:20.918
Well, probably more than
I should have.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.821
The black kid
and the deaf guy...

25:23.823 --> 25:25.589
Look, if my bringing them here
had anything to do with this

25:25.591 --> 25:28.459
I'm sorry.

25:28.461 --> 25:31.128
I hate to say this...

25:31.130 --> 25:32.663
maybe we should toss 'em out
right now

25:32.665 --> 25:36.400
while we still have the chance
and the fire power.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.969
Yeah. Yeah, I hear ya.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.105
We gotta protect
Sleeping Beauty.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.540
( chuckles )

25:42.542 --> 25:45.009
I'm not so sure about that.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.844
She seems pretty damn good
at that on her own.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.512
Yeah, how about that, huh?

26:07.833 --> 26:09.466
( door opens )

26:14.540 --> 26:18.375
What are you, anyway?

26:18.377 --> 26:21.178
Why are you here?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.147
I'm-

26:23.149 --> 26:24.782
I was...

26:29.855 --> 26:33.357
I don't know.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.725
I don't remember.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.528
You don't remember or
you don't want to tell me?

26:37.530 --> 26:39.763
What happened?

26:39.765 --> 26:40.864
Why- where am I?

26:40.866 --> 26:44.335
You were an animal
last night.

26:44.337 --> 26:48.973
Plus, you got bit by one of them
and nothing happened.

26:48.975 --> 26:49.873
Not yet, anyway.

26:49.875 --> 26:50.841
Maybe you're still gonna turn.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.611
Who knows?

26:53.613 --> 26:54.845
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.547
Normal people don't react
like that,

26:56.549 --> 26:58.482
so what does that make you, huh?

26:58.484 --> 27:02.186
Seriously, what?

27:02.188 --> 27:03.220
Back off.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.088
What?

27:04.090 --> 27:04.922
Look what happened to Karen.

27:04.924 --> 27:08.192
People are dying here
because of you.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.094
I don't know what
happened here.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.429
I don't know where I am.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.865
I have a daughter, Dylan.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.934
That's all I know or care about.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.602
I'm sorry but we've
all lost a lot

27:18.604 --> 27:20.270
while you've been here sleeping.

27:22.508 --> 27:26.443
And this whole story of yours
is just a little too weird.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.345
Back up.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.446
<i> Hey, hey.</i>

27:29.448 --> 27:30.514
Break it up.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.116
Hey, what'd I tell you
about this woman?

27:32.118 --> 27:33.183
Get your ass outta here!

27:33.185 --> 27:34.785
This woman is the reason
we were attacked last night.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.954
You need to back the hell up and
get the hell outta here, now.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.088
Go!

27:41.093 --> 27:43.293
Christ.

27:43.295 --> 27:47.097
Here, I got you some...
clothes.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.732
Where's my daughter?

27:48.734 --> 27:51.735
Where's Dylan?

27:51.737 --> 27:55.606
I- If you had a daughter
and she's out there, she's...

27:55.608 --> 27:57.675
she's dead.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.943
I'm sorry but that's
just a fact.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.088
Hey, look.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.090
He's just...

28:13.092 --> 28:18.128
he's been here a while and...

28:18.130 --> 28:20.798
I don't know
what happened to you.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.200
The world went to shit
a couple years ago.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.336
Years?

28:26.338 --> 28:29.139
We're just all trying
to get by.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.947
I can help you get outta here.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.249
So you can find your daughter.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.219
Just give me a chance
to figure it out.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.621
Axel, the other marine,
you know, he's ok,

28:44.623 --> 28:49.259
he's just by the book
and all that shit.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.095
I'll help you out.

29:09.381 --> 29:12.416
( water running )

29:42.181 --> 29:44.715
You don't gotta worry
about me, lady.

29:44.717 --> 29:46.850
I've seen everything you got
for three years.

29:46.852 --> 29:49.887
I'm pretty much over you.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.889
My name's Vanessa.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.927
Ok. Vanessa.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.096
Well, we don't got
that much water

29:59.098 --> 30:02.266
so it makes sense to double up
on showers.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.008
You know, we turn it off
when we're soaping up.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.910
That's the rule.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.554
So can you tell me?

30:23.556 --> 30:26.423
What the hell happened
to me?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.892
Please.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.994
Look, I don't know
what happened to you.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.730
I didn't even know you had
a daughter.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.866
We got sent in here
to pick up a dead body.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.576
Then some volcano goes off
in Wyoming,

30:45.578 --> 30:48.779
wipes out half
the western states.

30:48.781 --> 30:51.882
After that people just started
killing each other.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.650
People did?

30:53.652 --> 30:55.919
Yeah, well, it makes
you feel like an idiot

30:55.921 --> 30:58.789
to call them vampires
but they drink blood

30:58.791 --> 31:01.258
so, you know, you decide.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.861
And so you guys here,
you were-

31:03.863 --> 31:05.062
Yeah,

31:05.064 --> 31:06.063
we got dropped in.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.965
Half dozen of us
got dumped off.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.766
Our orders were to protect you
and the doctor,

31:09.768 --> 31:11.501
that's all.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.338
We were supposed to hold
this position

31:14.340 --> 31:17.140
until we were relieved.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.477
Folks've been calling this thing
"the rising".

31:20.479 --> 31:23.146
Whatever it is.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.415
I don't know.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.783
I did my duty.

31:26.785 --> 31:30.888
I watched you, I kept the Doc
alive after she got bit.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.789
That's it.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.427
Why me?

31:37.429 --> 31:41.298
Why would anybody be interested
in me?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.634
I figured you'd tell me
after you woke up.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.907
It's gotta have something to do
with this thing though.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.541
Has to.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.883
I have no idea.

31:59.885 --> 32:03.687
I mean, I'm nothing special.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.722
Honest.

32:05.724 --> 32:09.059
Well, somebody thought
you were.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.695
Looks like they were right.

32:11.697 --> 32:16.199
If anybody knew,
it was Doc, but...

32:16.201 --> 32:19.236
she said you should have
died already.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.238
That you were killed,

32:21.240 --> 32:24.141
that you weren't,
or you couldn't be.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.175
I don't know, man.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.344
I just watched you.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.647
( cocks gun )

32:30.649 --> 32:33.216
Let's go.

32:33.218 --> 32:36.420
Very slow, very quiet.

32:39.692 --> 32:42.693
That's a hell of a way to say
thank you, Vanessa.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.729
( sighs )

33:04.049 --> 33:05.015
( groans )

33:05.017 --> 33:05.415
Woah!

33:05.417 --> 33:06.183
Hey, hey, hey!

33:06.185 --> 33:07.050
What's going on here?

33:07.052 --> 33:08.051
Easy, easy, easy.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.286
Easy.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.754
Shoot me if you want.

33:10.756 --> 33:11.688
It's all good.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.292
But I'm getting out
of this place right now.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.793
I don't give a shit
about what you do to me.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.795
You're not gonna get 20 blocks
out there by yourself,

33:18.797 --> 33:19.963
I promise you.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.565
The man's got a point.

33:21.567 --> 33:22.366
I'll take my chances.

33:22.368 --> 33:23.066
Hey!

33:23.068 --> 33:25.569
Just...

33:25.571 --> 33:28.205
I'll see if any of the others
want to come with me.

33:30.242 --> 33:30.424
You and the others,

33:30.425 --> 33:30.607
you're just gonna walk past
all my booby traps,

33:30.609 --> 33:32.676
you're gonna get through
all the locks, all that shit?

33:32.678 --> 33:34.778
Alright, listen, this is
what we're gonna do.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.513
I'm gonna escort the little lady
back to the lab.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.448
You get some pants on
and join us.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.221
Alright, that suits me.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.390
Just everybody stay cool.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.191
Let's go.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.995
You ok?

33:51.997 --> 33:53.764
We gotta get some stuff
together now.

33:53.766 --> 33:54.898
Food, water.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.033
We're gonna get outta here.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.567
Fine by me.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.447
Where are you two
heading off to?

34:12.518 --> 34:14.785
Hmm?

34:14.787 --> 34:18.321
Axel, I'm just helping
the lady out.

34:18.323 --> 34:19.022
Nobody's going nowhere.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.057
Put the gun down.

34:20.059 --> 34:20.757
Axel-

34:20.759 --> 34:21.758
Now!

34:23.429 --> 34:24.494
<i> Come on, Axel!</i>

34:36.041 --> 34:39.142
Axel, the mission is over.

34:39.144 --> 34:40.710
It's over.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.813
Everything.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.781
The woman has a daughter.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.017
She just wants to find
her baby girl.

34:47.019 --> 34:48.518
How are you gonna get out
the front door?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.753
I'm gonna open it for her.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.687
Really?

34:50.689 --> 34:52.856
The way you did last night?

34:52.858 --> 34:53.790
What?

34:53.792 --> 34:55.792
Somebody opened
the front door, Ted.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.461
Somebody disabled those lights,
I think it was you.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.762
Bullshit, Axel-

34:58.764 --> 35:00.697
a bunch of people here
had the codes.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.299
A bunch of people have
the wrong codes

35:02.301 --> 35:05.302
because I gave you
all the wrong codes.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.369
But you knew where I keep
the real ones,

35:06.371 --> 35:07.904
in my notebook.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.573
You're the only one
that knows that.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.312
Alright.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.279
Hell, you got me this time!

35:16.281 --> 35:21.718
( fighting grunts )

35:21.720 --> 35:22.586
<i> Stop it!</i>

35:22.588 --> 35:23.587
<i> Stop it!</i>

35:25.924 --> 35:27.390
Why are you doing this,
you son of a bitch?!

35:27.392 --> 35:28.358
Stop it!

35:28.360 --> 35:29.726
Just... stop!

35:29.728 --> 35:33.763
( gun shot )

35:33.765 --> 35:36.800
( struggling )

35:36.802 --> 35:39.102
( groans )

35:39.104 --> 35:47.410
( fighting grunts )

35:50.115 --> 35:51.915
Ah!

35:51.917 --> 35:53.450
<i> Hey! What's going on?</i>

36:00.559 --> 36:01.791
Stupid!

36:28.353 --> 36:31.021
( out of breath )

36:31.023 --> 36:35.125
<i> ( birds cawing in distance )</i>

36:51.610 --> 36:53.810
<i> I don't care how we do this,</i>

36:53.812 --> 36:56.079
<i> but you're coming with me,</i>
<i> sweetheart.</i>

37:01.486 --> 37:03.119
Is that right?

37:03.121 --> 37:06.790
I'm afraid so.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.859
Dead or alive, it doesn't
really matter.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.515
( fighting grunts )

37:35.454 --> 37:39.623
( fighting grunts )

37:44.196 --> 37:46.830
( fighting grunts )

38:00.679 --> 38:02.479
Stop, Axel!

38:02.481 --> 38:03.847
I need to hand her over
to them.

38:03.849 --> 38:04.714
Who?

38:04.716 --> 38:05.515
Them.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.750
I told them you existed

38:06.752 --> 38:08.918
and now I'm gonna show 'em
you do.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.221
Stop! She's different!

38:11.223 --> 38:13.256
They're gonna want
to see this.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.025
Maybe then they'll leave
us alone.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.192
They promised me
they'd let us go!

38:16.194 --> 38:17.927
<i> Stop! Don't you do it, Axel!</i>

38:17.929 --> 38:19.529
<i> Don't you do it!</i>

38:19.531 --> 38:21.531
If you understood
what they did to me,

38:21.533 --> 38:23.366
what they did inside of me,

38:23.368 --> 38:25.368
you'd know why I was taking
her back.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.970
And I am taking her back!

38:26.972 --> 38:29.406
( fighting grunts )

38:29.408 --> 38:31.174
( bone snaps )

38:55.767 --> 38:57.334
She's got superpowers now.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.802
Great.

39:06.812 --> 39:14.718
( gasping )

39:35.006 --> 39:38.808
I'm sure this is all a lot
to take in right now.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.111
Yeah, a little bit.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.147
Waking up the way you did,

39:44.149 --> 39:46.282
the world having gone to shit
and everything.

39:46.284 --> 39:50.186
I just need to be alone
right now, ok?

39:50.188 --> 39:53.857
Yeah. Yeah, no, I get that.

39:53.859 --> 39:57.627
Well, if you need...
to talk or anything,

39:57.629 --> 39:59.429
I'll just be out here.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.765
No offense, but
go off yourself.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.169
Understood.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.971
Good, then go do it.

40:07.973 --> 40:08.872
Hey, you know what lady?

40:08.874 --> 40:11.107
I'm just trying to do
my job, ok?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.376
Just trying my very best
to protect you!

40:13.378 --> 40:14.878
I don't need protecting!

40:14.880 --> 40:15.812
Really?

40:15.814 --> 40:17.881
Yes.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.516
And I will get out of here
and find my daughter

40:19.518 --> 40:20.884
without your permission.

40:20.886 --> 40:24.020
You're gonna try.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.956
Are you gonna stop me?

40:26.958 --> 40:28.525
I have to.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.393
You know that.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.833
Do what you gotta do.

I saw him!

43:05.250 --> 43:08.484
He's a goddamn feeder!!

43:08.486 --> 43:10.553
Yo, check his eyes, bro.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.221
They're friggin' human.

43:14.893 --> 43:15.658
You did this.

43:15.660 --> 43:16.326
Hey, hey, hey.

43:16.328 --> 43:17.226
Easy.

43:17.228 --> 43:18.027
What the hell are you?

43:18.029 --> 43:19.095
I didn't do anything.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.263
She turned me.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.898
I'm human again.

43:21.900 --> 43:22.465
What?

43:22.467 --> 43:23.399

43:28.807 --> 43:30.039
I...

43:33.712 --> 43:38.581
I can feel again.
