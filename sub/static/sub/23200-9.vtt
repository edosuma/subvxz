00:32.323 --> 00:33.658
Here We go.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.765
What's the matter, Gladys?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.311
Doc, I think she's crying.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.857
It's all right, Gladys. We'll find you
another friend someday soon.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.235
Easy, boys, easy.
He's just been tranquilized.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.250
Gladys, don't worry.
Bluebeard is just sleeping.

01:42.059 --> 01:43.686
Get out of the way, kid.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.410
Would you cool it, Gladys?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.872
Darrell, go get her some fish.

02:03.664 --> 02:05.041
All right.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.127
Gladys, you just hush up.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.213
Bluebeard's going to be all right.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.521
What's going on, kid?

02:27.605 --> 02:30.357
They're shipping Bluebeard over there
down to San Diego.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.942
Bluebeard, eh?

02:32.151 --> 02:35.446
Maybe you better do what the lady says
and go get some fish.

02:36.071 --> 02:37.156
Sure.

02:44.788 --> 02:47.416
All right, boys. Over here. On the double.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.169
Sleep tight, Bluebeard.

02:55.215 --> 02:58.969
Where are you going?
Officer, what's the problem?

02:59.428 --> 03:02.264
Sorry, lady, we need all the help
we can get.

03:02.347 --> 03:05.809
We got a tip there's gonna be
some kind of a robbery here today.

03:05.893 --> 03:06.935
A robbery?

03:07.728 --> 03:10.230
Supposedly when they load
the armored car.

03:10.522 --> 03:12.733
Come on, fellows. Move out.

03:12.941 --> 03:14.693
Now, wait a minute!

03:17.779 --> 03:20.324
I'm sorry. You're just gonna have
to guard it yourself.

03:20.407 --> 03:23.368
I'm taking this dolphin to San Diego,
and they're coming with me.

03:23.452 --> 03:27.581
All I want is the women and children
out of this whole front area. Okay?

03:27.664 --> 03:29.499
Now, move out, fellows!

03:29.583 --> 03:33.587
I am Dr. Stubbs,
curator of marine mammals...

03:33.670 --> 03:35.672
and I give the orders around here.

03:35.755 --> 03:36.840
You two, get back-

03:36.923 --> 03:39.968
If you're so sure that this animal
Bluebeard needs company...

03:40.051 --> 03:42.012
then maybe you better go along with us.

03:42.095 --> 03:43.180
What?

06:19.835 --> 06:22.004
Excuse me, but I'm in a little bit
of a hurry.

06:22.087 --> 06:24.423
They're expecting me
at the undersea research lab...

06:24.506 --> 06:26.842
- and my plane was late.
- We've been waiting for you.

06:26.925 --> 06:28.885
Call headquarters in Washington
right away.

06:28.969 --> 06:30.387
We can put you through from here.

06:30.470 --> 06:33.223
I was to call and be briefed
after I look at the dolphin.

06:33.306 --> 06:36.435
We just got word. The dolphin
that was to be shipped down here today?

06:36.518 --> 06:38.395
- Yeah.
- It's been stolen.

06:38.478 --> 06:40.522
Stolen? A dolphin?

06:43.108 --> 06:45.819
He's a bottlenose dolphin,
and his name is Bluebeard.

06:45.902 --> 06:48.989
He was captured two days ago
by Marine Park in Los Angeles.

06:49.072 --> 06:51.199
They spotted him
following one of their boats.

06:51.283 --> 06:54.035
And just this morning,
they noticed the Navy tattoo mark...

06:54.119 --> 06:55.370
and reported it to Washington.

06:55.453 --> 06:57.455
What does the Navy say about him?

06:57.539 --> 06:59.708
Not much, they can't find
his service records.

07:00.292 --> 07:03.336
- Dolphins have service records?
- They sure do.

07:03.420 --> 07:06.506
Only Bluebeard's
is either mislaid or stolen.

07:06.589 --> 07:09.801
All they know is that he served
four years in research...

07:09.884 --> 07:12.303
for the Navy SEALAB in Florida.

07:12.387 --> 07:15.557
Apparently two weeks ago,
he went AWOL from the Caribbean.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.184
Since then he's been listed
as missing or dead...

07:18.268 --> 07:20.228
until he showed up here in Los Angeles.

07:20.311 --> 07:23.148
Wait a minute, Steve.
It's not possible to swim...

07:23.231 --> 07:26.776
from the Caribbean to L.A. in two weeks,
even if you're a dolphin.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.487
And even if you took a shortcut
through the Panama Canal.

07:29.571 --> 07:32.907
Right. That's exactly why Washington
brought this case to our attention.

07:32.991 --> 07:35.576
So Bluebeard must've been
stolen from the Caribbean...

07:35.660 --> 07:38.788
and then transported by air or land to L.A.

07:38.955 --> 07:41.833
And then somehow escaped
into the Pacific.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.919
Only to be recovered,
and then stolen again today.

07:45.002 --> 07:46.254
Without his service record...

07:46.337 --> 07:48.840
the Navy can't tell us
exactly what he was trained for.

07:48.923 --> 07:52.260
Whoever stole him seems to be
one up on us in that department.

07:52.343 --> 07:56.347
Bluebeard is obviously pretty good
at something special.

07:56.681 --> 08:00.017
But who would want a dolphin
badly enough to steal him twice?

08:00.101 --> 08:01.352
And why?

08:07.817 --> 08:09.360
Excuse me, sir.

08:10.236 --> 08:11.404
Mr. Lockhart?

08:11.821 --> 08:13.990
Don't bother me now, Henry.

08:14.907 --> 08:18.119
Tell James to go lower.
We're approaching the ocean now.

08:18.202 --> 08:19.704
I'll tell him.

08:20.287 --> 08:21.455
There it is.

08:22.164 --> 08:24.208
Twenty miles of coastline.

08:24.959 --> 08:28.712
The most expensive
real-estate development in America.

08:29.046 --> 08:30.756
Tell him to fly slower.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.301
We will, sir.
But at the moment you have a phone call.

08:34.552 --> 08:36.053
Code Harpoon.

08:39.472 --> 08:42.268
- Gaffer?
- Yes, sir. Right on schedule.

08:42.643 --> 08:44.144
Did you get him?

08:44.227 --> 08:46.146
Safe as a goldfish in a bowl.

08:46.272 --> 08:48.399
That's what you said the last time...

08:48.482 --> 08:52.861
when we flew that dolphin here
from Florida only to have him get away.

08:52.945 --> 08:56.991
Sir, it won't happen again.
Bluebeard has had his little fling.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.785
He will deliver for us.
Don't worry about it.

08:59.868 --> 09:02.037
If he doesn't, it's you...

09:02.121 --> 09:03.664
Who'll be fed to the sharks.

09:03.747 --> 09:04.873
Yes, sir.

09:13.006 --> 09:15.342
It's time for champagne, Henry.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.262
And tell James
to circle the entire project again.

09:18.345 --> 09:19.638
Yes, sir.

09:20.514 --> 09:24.226
The most expensive housing tract
in the entire world...

09:24.643 --> 09:26.395
and it's going to be mine.

09:26.853 --> 09:29.606
Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.

09:33.568 --> 09:35.237
What'd the security chief say?

09:35.320 --> 09:38.240
- He said the sheriff just called.
- The real sheriff?

09:38.323 --> 09:40.575
They say a Highway Patrolman
spotted your truck...

09:40.659 --> 09:42.577
in a little place called Mountain Junction.

09:42.661 --> 09:44.913
You're kidding. That's inland.

09:44.996 --> 09:47.833
He seemed pretty sure.
He said he saw it and then lost it.

09:47.916 --> 09:49.417
Was Dr. Stubbs still with them?

09:49.501 --> 09:52.546
He didn't say. But I'm going out there
to take a look for myself.

09:52.629 --> 09:56.132
Wait. You know, it reminded me
that I started feeding Gladys again, and-

09:56.216 --> 09:58.426
Darrell, I'll be back later, okay?

09:58.510 --> 10:02.347
Wait. It reminded me about how much
Bluebeard ate. He never stopped.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.598
What're you getting at?

10:03.682 --> 10:06.893
Dr. Stubbs, she went to take
some food along in the truck for him.

10:06.977 --> 10:09.187
But they took off
before she could get it loaded.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.273
Poor guy. By now
he must be starving to death.

10:12.899 --> 10:16.569
There can't be too many stores
that sell fresh fish in Mountain Junction.

10:16.653 --> 10:18.196
- Thanks, Darrell.
- Sure.

10:19.239 --> 10:20.615
Thank you.

10:38.383 --> 10:40.134
Excuse me, ma'am.

10:49.435 --> 10:53.398
Oh, gosh! I'm sorry. Here. Let me help you.

10:53.773 --> 10:57.443
- Boy, I guess you like fish.
- I got a lot of cats, lady.

10:57.819 --> 11:00.154
I hope nobody else around here does.

11:00.238 --> 11:02.156
Looks like you bought the whole store out.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.535
Would you keep your hands off?
There's more inside. Go buy your own.

11:05.618 --> 11:07.787
You're not very polite for a police officer.

11:07.870 --> 11:09.789
So I'm off-duty, maybe.

11:10.122 --> 11:12.833
You're gonna carry fish in a squad car?

11:14.669 --> 11:19.507
I'm sorry, lady,
but if you had as many cats as I do...

11:19.882 --> 11:21.342
I gotta go now.

11:21.509 --> 11:23.177
- Let me help.
- No!

11:23.594 --> 11:25.680
I mean, excuse me...

11:26.764 --> 11:29.517
Here, take one, if you like.

12:00.255 --> 12:03.425
Hello, Capt. Gaffer? Hello, sir? Come in.

12:24.238 --> 12:27.866
- Billy, Where are you?
- Hello, Captain, I got the fish.

12:28.283 --> 12:30.827
But I think I better deliver them
somewhere else.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.793
I think I got a problem here.

12:46.760 --> 12:51.056
Okay, you. Out of my way.
I'm warning you!

12:56.353 --> 12:58.647
Now tell me.

12:59.064 --> 13:00.524
Where is the dolphin?

13:36.309 --> 13:38.645
Help! Help me!

13:46.152 --> 13:49.113
Hold still. It's all right.
I'm Diana Prince from the IADC.

13:49.197 --> 13:53.326
- You're Dr. Stubbs, Sylvia Stubbs, right?
- I'll kill him! That man, I'll kill him!

13:53.409 --> 13:54.744
You're talking about Gaffer?

13:54.827 --> 13:57.372
That idiot just dumped Bluebeard
into the surf.

13:57.455 --> 14:00.666
What? He went to all the trouble
of stealing the dolphin...

14:00.750 --> 14:01.959
just to turn him loose?

14:02.043 --> 14:04.212
And then he ran down the beach
laughing at me.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.297
Now we'll never get Bluebeard back.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.002
Here you are.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.087
Gladys has worn a harness before,
hasn't she?

14:47.171 --> 14:51.509
Yes. But now she has a receiver implant.
I've trained her to come in when it bleeps.

14:51.592 --> 14:52.676
We have a code.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.304
So long as it will transmit
as well as receive.

14:55.387 --> 14:57.556
Hi, Diana. Did you find out anything new?

14:57.640 --> 15:00.684
Not much, I'm afraid.
That man that Wonder Woman caught...

15:00.768 --> 15:04.396
his name is Billy. He doesn't know
any more than he already told her:

15:04.480 --> 15:07.691
that he was hired right off the dock
by a man named Gaffer.

15:07.775 --> 15:10.235
The police say they're gonna have
to turn him loose.

15:10.319 --> 15:13.489
Why? Billy impersonated a cop, didn't he?

15:14.281 --> 15:15.866
He helped in the heist.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.910
The police will keep an eye on him,
I'm sure.

15:17.993 --> 15:19.953
Billy has no idea
why they stole the dolphin.

15:20.037 --> 15:22.831
He doesn't even know
where Gaffer can be found.

15:22.915 --> 15:25.667
That fellow Gaffer didn't strike me
as being smart enough...

15:25.751 --> 15:29.171
to be in charge of anything.
There's got to be somebody else.

15:29.838 --> 15:31.298
Undoubtedly.

15:31.632 --> 15:34.092
Someone very powerful
who has a particular use...

15:34.176 --> 15:35.886
for a dolphin named Bluebeard.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.597
If we can just find him and get him back-

15:38.680 --> 15:42.100
Come on. He could be anywhere
in the whole Pacific Ocean by now.

15:42.184 --> 15:45.020
What, Gladys? What do you think?

15:47.898 --> 15:50.817
Don't tell me you're gonna have her
go looking for Bluebeard?

15:50.901 --> 15:52.944
Nope. He's gonna find her.

15:54.946 --> 15:58.116
That's how we accidentally caught him
in the first place, Darrell.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.203
He followed Gladys here
back to one of our boats.

16:01.286 --> 16:03.580
Why'd he want to do a thing like that?

16:06.833 --> 16:11.129
When you applied for this summer job,
how old did you say you were?

16:15.467 --> 16:17.969
Oh, yeah.

16:20.472 --> 16:21.639
Yeah.

16:31.816 --> 16:35.779
All right, Mr. Goodspeed,
I'll take that one...

16:36.738 --> 16:38.281
and that one...

16:38.364 --> 16:43.036
and we'll throw in the 500 condominiums
under construction for good measure.

16:44.162 --> 16:46.164
No. No sale.

16:47.957 --> 16:51.127
With all those bank loans
coming due next week?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.254
Be reasonable.

16:54.088 --> 16:58.801
For just a small share in your project,
I'm offering you $200 million.

16:59.469 --> 17:02.221
I thought I made it clear to you before.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.558
I will not sell.

17:06.684 --> 17:09.604
Ira, you and your partners...

17:09.686 --> 17:11.772
are out on a very long limb.

17:12.315 --> 17:17.194
Of course. I've gambled my whole fortune,
my whole life, on this project.

17:20.364 --> 17:22.700
Nothing like that is going to happen.

17:22.782 --> 17:24.702
But if it did...

17:24.993 --> 17:26.621
why, everyone would sell...

17:26.704 --> 17:29.707
and then you'd beg me to bail you out.

17:34.545 --> 17:38.382
I know how you almost bought
control of Palm Beach last year.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.927
I know how you plan to monopolize...

17:42.011 --> 17:45.723
every worthwhile piece of coastal property
north of Mexico.

17:46.807 --> 17:48.893
Well, it's not going to happen.

17:49.518 --> 17:52.396
I won't let you get your foot
in the door here.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.440
Not in Heavenly Shores.

17:55.065 --> 17:56.275
Never!

17:58.652 --> 18:00.738
All right, Mr. Goodspeed.

18:00.821 --> 18:05.284
I just wanted everyone to know
I gave you this one last chance.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.537
And if there ever is a panic...

18:10.748 --> 18:13.917
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go fishing.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.605
That sounds clearer.
Can you send her out now?

18:34.688 --> 18:36.690
Yes. Off you go, honey.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.112
Swim around a bit, Gladys.

18:54.207 --> 18:56.793
- That's it.
- Oh, no.

18:57.294 --> 19:01.173
If Gladys swims maybe 20 miles an hour,
it'll take her all morning...

19:01.256 --> 19:04.050
just for her to go back and forth
in a 10-mile square.

19:04.134 --> 19:09.055
So if the Pacific Ocean
is 6,000 miles wide...

19:09.139 --> 19:12.475
times 8,000 or 10,000 miles long...

19:13.351 --> 19:15.604
that's 60 million square miles.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.482
Darrell, stop thinking.

19:20.734 --> 19:23.695
But that's worse
than looking for a needle in a haystack.

19:23.778 --> 19:27.032
I figure it would take about 10,000 years...

19:27.115 --> 19:30.994
for Bluebeard to find Gladys.
And that's without any days off.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.835
What's the matter with that thing?

19:38.918 --> 19:40.211
She's circling.

19:44.048 --> 19:46.217
Now she's speeding up again.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.845
Look at all the birds over there.

19:56.019 --> 19:58.688
Something's scaring the fish. Shark?

19:59.480 --> 20:01.733
There's one over there. Look. See it?

20:05.069 --> 20:07.238
Gladys, come in.

20:08.906 --> 20:11.534
Maybe we ought to get the boat
and try to scare them off.

20:11.617 --> 20:15.413
That's a great idea.
Listen, I'll take this. You go on ahead.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.124
She'll never be able to get away.
They'll kill her.

20:18.207 --> 20:19.750
You go, too. Help her with the boat.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.502
- All right.
- Go on.

22:21.371 --> 22:25.041
- Is she all right?
- She needs a rest, that's all.

22:25.584 --> 22:26.710
I can't blame her.

22:26.793 --> 22:30.255
Thank goodness
something frightened those sharks away.

22:30.338 --> 22:32.966
I hate to say this,
but maybe Darrell was right.

22:33.049 --> 22:36.219
Maybe we didn't have
such a good idea, after all.

23:27.603 --> 23:29.188
Easy with that.

23:31.232 --> 23:33.484
Where are the release magnets?

23:33.693 --> 23:37.280
These four magnets.
Just like the ones used in space research.

23:37.363 --> 23:40.992
I had Henry buy out the only laboratory
in the West that makes such things.

23:41.075 --> 23:43.494
How much pull would it take
to get this apart?

23:43.577 --> 23:46.622
I want Bluebeard to be able to get loose
with his first tug.

23:46.706 --> 23:48.624
The top will stick to the metal forever...

23:48.708 --> 23:51.794
but the bottom breaks loose
from the harness. Here, hold it.

23:52.962 --> 23:54.797
See? Let me show you how.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.174
There. See how easy it is?

23:57.258 --> 24:00.970
A 10-pound pull,
just twice the weight of the payload.

24:02.555 --> 24:04.974
Bluebeard's gonna love this. It'll work.

24:05.057 --> 24:07.810
Almost time for the dress rehearsal,
gentlemen. Shall we?

24:07.893 --> 24:09.645
Bluebeard's already aboard.

24:09.728 --> 24:11.814
You're gonna dig his performance.

24:11.939 --> 24:13.816
Would you cast off for me, please?

24:13.899 --> 24:17.736
You should have asked me
to get a smaller boat, Mr. Lockhart.

24:18.237 --> 24:20.656
May I ask you, sir, where it is we're going?

24:20.739 --> 24:25.327
To the Pacific missile test range,
where the Navy does its target practice.

24:43.679 --> 24:45.556
Be any minute now, sir.

24:45.764 --> 24:48.350
That old hulk won't last long
once we start shooting.

24:48.433 --> 24:49.768
I can promise you that.

25:12.207 --> 25:16.294
There he goes, sir.
He'll be mostly underwater from here on.

25:18.421 --> 25:20.882
I hope he gets clear
before they start firing.

25:20.966 --> 25:22.634
I just hope we do.

25:44.698 --> 25:47.075
I know, sir. It's not very good coffee.

25:47.158 --> 25:49.869
But I'm sure when you see our firing...

25:59.879 --> 26:01.631
He's away, sir.

26:01.881 --> 26:04.092
He's coming back.

26:04.175 --> 26:06.219
We'd better be getting out of here,
hadn't we?

26:06.302 --> 26:09.806
No, not until I'm sure
that Bluebeard is all right.

26:13.059 --> 26:14.477
There he is.

26:15.228 --> 26:18.022
Come on, baby. Follow me!

26:44.173 --> 26:47.969
By Jove, that's marksmanship!

26:48.260 --> 26:50.972
You did it, sir. Incredible.

26:51.263 --> 26:53.808
- And with the very first shot.
- Sir.

26:54.517 --> 26:56.060
Thank you, sir.

26:56.602 --> 26:58.979
But I'm not sure...

26:59.063 --> 27:01.607
we've started firing yet.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.784
He did it. What a dress rehearsal.

27:12.993 --> 27:15.663
That dolphin of his is superb, Mr. Lockhart.

27:15.746 --> 27:17.498
Yes, Henry. Superb.

27:20.042 --> 27:22.419
Didn't I tell you he'd deliver?

27:23.087 --> 27:25.589
I wish you'd tell me
what this dress rehearsal was for.

27:36.141 --> 27:37.601
There it is.

27:38.102 --> 27:39.895
Now, that's a target.

27:40.646 --> 27:45.067
Longer than the Empire State Building
and wider than a football stadium.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.821
She's one of the largest tankers
in the whole world.

27:48.904 --> 27:50.822
She looks rather full.

27:51.949 --> 27:55.577
Only 500,000 tons of crude oil, that's all.

27:57.663 --> 28:00.540
And if that were to spill near the coast...

28:00.707 --> 28:04.252
and if I had all my money invested
in Heavenly Shores...

28:04.378 --> 28:06.463
I'd panic, wouldn't you?

28:17.474 --> 28:21.603
One of my divers found this
stuck to the bottom of the sunken ship.

28:22.145 --> 28:25.899
- You think this is what sank it?
- All I know is we didn't blow it up.

28:29.277 --> 28:30.695
Wait a second.

28:32.197 --> 28:33.615
It's a magnet.

28:34.199 --> 28:37.035
Must be a release magnet,
like the kind that NASA's developed.

28:37.118 --> 28:38.161
I'll be darned.

28:38.244 --> 28:40.664
So maybe it fell off a satellite.

28:40.914 --> 28:43.375
I'd better turn this over
to Naval Intelligence.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.669
It might be Russian, you know.

28:49.881 --> 28:51.549
Or maybe it fell off a dolphin.

28:52.884 --> 28:54.094
What?

28:54.469 --> 28:56.763
I wonder where they make those things.

28:56.846 --> 28:58.556
Time-wise we should be all right, sir.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.893
Tuesday morning at 8:30,
the tanker will reach a spot...

29:01.976 --> 29:04.938
where shipping lanes turn south
along the coast.

29:05.313 --> 29:07.899
Only five miles off Heavenly Shores.

29:08.233 --> 29:12.153
The tide will be going in,
and everything will be in your favor, sir.

29:12.237 --> 29:14.572
Only one thing concerns me.

29:15.573 --> 29:18.242
The explosive payload
that we used in practice...

29:18.326 --> 29:20.662
isn't big enough for a ship that size...

29:20.745 --> 29:23.081
and the dolphin can only carry
so much payload.

29:23.164 --> 29:25.208
Do you have a solution for that, Henry?

29:25.291 --> 29:28.586
We substitute two ordinary bolts
for the four release magnets...

29:28.669 --> 29:31.297
and replace that weight
with extra explosive.

29:32.090 --> 29:33.758
Very good, Henry.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.010
Drop me off at the boat.

29:36.093 --> 29:39.514
You get down to the laboratory
and supervise the change.

29:39.597 --> 29:42.934
You know, of course, that the dolphin
won't be able to break away.

29:43.017 --> 29:46.437
What's one dolphin lost
in the biggest oil spill in history?

30:16.509 --> 30:19.512
We're closed for the day.
Come back in the morning.

30:19.595 --> 30:22.473
- This is government business.
- Sorry.

30:23.057 --> 30:26.143
Listen, I'm from the IADC,
and this can't wait until morning.

30:27.311 --> 30:28.812
Are you there?

30:31.482 --> 30:32.650
Hello?

32:39.650 --> 32:42.528
What is it that you're
trying to keep me away from?

32:45.573 --> 32:46.782
Thank you very much.

33:33.203 --> 33:34.663
Gaffer's service record?

33:35.164 --> 33:38.000
They probably stole it
so we wouldn't be able to trace him.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.960
Probably did the same to the dolphin.

33:40.044 --> 33:41.712
That's what I figured.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.006
It seems Gaffer is just a nickname.

33:44.089 --> 33:47.092
His real name is Schultz,
and he was dishonorably discharged.

33:47.176 --> 33:48.469
Schultz, Melvin T.

33:48.552 --> 33:50.137
You already have a line on him, Ira?

33:50.220 --> 33:53.849
Ira's been fed the name of every sailor
who's ever worked with a dolphin.

33:53.932 --> 33:57.019
Melvin Schultz was
one of the men who trained Bluebeard.

33:58.145 --> 34:01.231
So Bluebeard and Gaffer,
or Schultz, or whatever his name is...

34:01.315 --> 34:03.317
he and Bluebeard go back a long way?

34:03.692 --> 34:04.776
Affirmative.

34:04.860 --> 34:08.071
Well, is there any hint
as to what Gaffer trained him for?

34:08.196 --> 34:11.491
The fact that Schultz also had
training in demolition...

34:11.574 --> 34:13.034
may be relevant.

34:13.368 --> 34:14.703
Demolition?

34:15.495 --> 34:17.496
Steve, you think that maybe...

34:17.581 --> 34:20.625
whatever blew up that empty ship
was placed there by Bluebeard?

34:20.876 --> 34:23.545
Well, it's possible. But why an empty ship?

34:23.628 --> 34:26.047
Unless it's some kind of practice run.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.842
- The IRAC computer has more-
- Practice run for what?

34:28.925 --> 34:30.385
That's what we've got to find out.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.512
First we've got to find out
who hired Schultz.

34:32.596 --> 34:34.514
The IRAC computer has more on-

34:34.598 --> 34:37.309
He must tie in
with the parts company somehow.

34:37.391 --> 34:39.226
Yes. Hey, have you checked out-

34:40.520 --> 34:43.899
The telephone manners
of Steve Trevor and Diana Prince...

34:43.982 --> 34:45.567
lea ve much to be desired.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.572
Sorry, Ira.
You were trying to say something?

34:50.947 --> 34:53.116
According to Coast Guard records...

34:53.241 --> 34:56.369
Melvin Schultz purchased a sea vessel
10 days ago.

34:56.703 --> 34:57.871
Great.

34:58.121 --> 35:00.582
What's the name of the boat,
and where is it docked?

35:00.665 --> 35:03.877
And speak up, Ira.
I seem to be deaf in one ear.

35:28.818 --> 35:30.778
Excuse me, sir, could you please tell me...

35:30.862 --> 35:33.489
where I could find a boat called the...

35:33.948 --> 35:35.616
Jolly...

35:37.076 --> 35:38.119
Billy.

35:46.794 --> 35:49.130
Billy, wait! You can't get away.

35:49.672 --> 35:50.965
Grab her! She's a cop.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.801
I thought you said
the cops weren't following you anymore.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.762
Maybe she's not a cop,
but she sure is something.

35:56.846 --> 36:00.016
All I know is
every time I see her, I'm carrying fish.

36:00.099 --> 36:01.851
All right, that's enough!

36:03.728 --> 36:05.438
Throw her on board.

36:05.521 --> 36:07.523
We don't want to be late for the party.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.162
Okay, let me turn off the motor.

36:22.163 --> 36:24.540
- There.
- Yeah, it's a little better.

36:27.501 --> 36:30.504
Gladys must still be 8 or 9 miles away.

36:30.671 --> 36:33.257
- Think she's still going north?
- Looks that way.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.177
Why didn't she come back
when you told her to?

36:37.261 --> 36:38.304
I don't know...

36:38.387 --> 36:41.599
unless she smelled something,
or heard something, or felt something.

36:41.724 --> 36:43.892
You don't suppose she found Bluebeard?

36:43.976 --> 36:45.227
I don't know.

36:45.311 --> 36:49.106
But if she has, he certainly has moved
into a fancy neighborhood.

36:52.860 --> 36:54.987
- What is it?
- I've never seen anything like it.

36:55.070 --> 36:56.363
Let me see.

36:57.114 --> 37:00.159
- It's a supertanker.
- It's humongous.

37:00.409 --> 37:02.119
It's not Bluebeard, okay?

37:02.244 --> 37:03.996
No more false alarms, Darrell.

37:04.079 --> 37:07.708
If we don't keep moving,
Gladys will swim right out of radio range.

37:07.791 --> 37:08.917
All right.

37:22.055 --> 37:25.183
I still wish somebody would tell me
where this target is.

37:25.475 --> 37:26.727
Hey, Billy!

37:27.060 --> 37:28.770
I need you in the wheelhouse.

37:32.232 --> 37:33.900
Okay, let's get those engines going.

37:33.984 --> 37:36.695
I don't want that dolphin
to get too far away from us.

37:36.778 --> 37:38.280
Billy, where are you?

37:46.204 --> 37:47.664
Hold it right there.

37:48.248 --> 37:50.750
Now, let me get Bluebeard's radio going.

37:50.834 --> 37:52.294
Billy, I need you!

38:12.272 --> 38:15.483
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep your eye on that girl.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.193
No, I need him right here.

38:18.319 --> 38:20.530
Who's giving orders around here, anyway?

38:20.613 --> 38:22.490
Well, that's not quite clear.

38:25.785 --> 38:28.496
I am the captain.
You take your orders from me.

38:30.164 --> 38:32.458
Now I'm the captain of this ship.

38:34.961 --> 38:38.047
Okay, you're the boss. I understand.

39:21.674 --> 39:22.883
Good Lord!

39:23.175 --> 39:25.845
You don't want Bluebeard
to blow up that thing?

39:26.095 --> 39:27.596
Not that oil tanker?

39:28.013 --> 39:30.015
That's practically a whole oil field!

39:30.349 --> 39:32.601
Think of the wildlife that will be killed...

39:32.685 --> 39:34.937
to say nothing of those people
on that tanker.

39:37.356 --> 39:38.440
Bluebeard.

39:41.777 --> 39:43.362
Come on, turn around.

39:48.701 --> 39:50.244
Turn around, baby.

39:53.205 --> 39:56.375
That's your signal.
We're not gonna do this thing.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.711
Your transmitter doesn't work anymore.

39:59.211 --> 40:00.587
Mine does, Gaffer.

40:03.632 --> 40:06.051
Head for home, full speed ahead.

40:06.718 --> 40:08.345
You're not going to leave him?

40:08.720 --> 40:11.390
No. He'll never be able to catch up with us.

40:11.473 --> 40:14.518
He won't even be able
to get off the bottom of that ship.

40:14.601 --> 40:16.937
This is Bluebeard's last ride, my friend.

41:08.405 --> 41:09.614
What's the matter?

41:09.698 --> 41:12.075
I don't know. Some kind of interference.

41:41.229 --> 41:42.563
He can't break loose!

41:43.815 --> 41:44.941
You scum!

41:45.024 --> 41:46.693
He'll blow up with that tanker!

41:51.447 --> 41:54.075
It sounds like a tornado.
Where is she, anyway?

41:56.369 --> 41:58.704
That is another radio interfering.

41:59.872 --> 42:02.583
Come on, Gladys.
We've got to help Bluebeard.

42:06.629 --> 42:07.713
Bluebeard.

42:53.259 --> 42:54.385
Hell!

43:12.569 --> 43:13.862
Hey, Doc! Look!

43:15.113 --> 43:17.366
Is it Gladys and Bluebeard?

43:22.204 --> 43:23.580
You see them?

43:25.374 --> 43:26.458
It is!

43:28.043 --> 43:29.253
We did it!

43:38.887 --> 43:41.223
Here you go. Come on.

43:53.151 --> 43:55.111
You've got him working, I see.

43:55.278 --> 43:58.073
Well, the gentleman is here on probation...

43:58.281 --> 44:00.367
and he does have a way with dolphins.

44:00.450 --> 44:04.246
Wonder Woman and the court were hoping
he could help you un-train Bluebeard...

44:04.329 --> 44:06.915
so that he can't be used
to blow things up again.

44:09.125 --> 44:11.753
Wonder Woman said
that you seemed pretty relieved...

44:11.836 --> 44:14.506
when she stopped your boat
and captured that Lockhart.

44:15.423 --> 44:18.009
Yeah, well, that Wonder Woman
is something else.

45:07.350 --> 45:08.851
