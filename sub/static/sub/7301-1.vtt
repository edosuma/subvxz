In my hand no prize I bring

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.461

01:11:02.608 --> 01:11:04.776
Now it will.

01:11:11.241 --> 01:11:15.062
All right, now, listen to me. Listen.

01:11:15.162 --> 01:11:19.483
Because of the deteriorating situation
on the highways,

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:25.254
we have no fresh meat or produce
again today.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.049
Wait a minute.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.093
Hold it.

01:11:30.344 --> 01:11:32.570
Wait, listen.

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:39.310
In order to ensure that there is enough
remaining canned stock to go around,

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:45.441
we're going to have to limit everyone
to 12 items again.

Hunter!

01:12:57.497 --> 01:12:59.152

01:13:00.051 --> 01:13:02.124
Hunter!

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.759
Agh! You stupid son of a bitch!
You could've killed me!

01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:11.845
- You said, "Do something."
- Do something else! Shit!

01:13:11.945 --> 01:13:13.696
- Sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:14.973
I'd better leave before you get mad.

01:13:15.073 --> 01:13:17.241
Oh, yeah. Right.

01:13:19.203 --> 01:13:20.870
There!

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.206
See you later, cowboy!

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.712
Creep!

01:13:38.931 --> 01:13:41.583
Mommy, I don't wanna go.
I wanna stay with you and Daddy.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.168
It's not safe here anymore.

01:13:43.268 --> 01:13:46.130
And you'd be better off in the country
away from everything.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:49.591
- Mommy!
- We'll all be together again soon.

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.693
- I love you, precious.
- Bye.

Rostov can.

If you can find him.

01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:50.115
I'll find him.

Here's what I want you to do.

01:18:54.788 --> 01:18:58.207
Hunter, this is suicidal. I can't do this.

01:18:58.959 --> 01:19:00.876
The Agency will never go for it.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.130
Do you realize what kind
of cooperation this will take?

Think of the risks.

in Downtown Atlanta,

01:19:28.655 --> 01:19:30.140
at the temporary headquarters

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.242
of the newly formed Southeast
Military Assistance Command.

01:19:33.493 --> 01:19:36.787
The governors of all 50 states
and high-ranking military personnel

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:38.899
are gathering here
for an emergency meeting

01:19:38.999 --> 01:19:42.277
that could very well determine
the future of democracy in this country.

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:45.030
The purpose of the conference
is to create an effective plan

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:47.866
to turn back the tide of terror
sweeping the nation,

01:19:47.966 --> 01:19:51.411
and to head off an impending
suspension of constitutional rights

01:19:51.511 --> 01:19:54.305
and the imposition of total martial law
in the land..

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:19.830

I don't know who you are.

01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:45.108
I don't know who you think you are,
or who you're fighting for.

01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:50.295
But it's people like you
who turned this nation upside down.

01:21:50.588 --> 01:21:56.051
And nobody, but nobody, is beyond the law.

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.958
The three major networks
issued a joint statement today

01:22:02.058 --> 01:22:04.628
denying that television coverage
of terrorist activities

01:22:04.728 --> 01:22:07.730
had in any way compounded their effect.

01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:11.051
The Dow has dropped 30 points
since the opening bell.

01:22:11.151 --> 01:22:14.028
And analyst Winslow Roberts
of Stone & Glimmer says

01:22:14.279 --> 01:22:18.141
that if no profit-taking adjustments
are made this afternoon in blue chips,

01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:21.035
the Dow may set a record loss....

...people killed in a civil war
among low-rider clubs.

01:22:24.831 --> 01:22:25.857
And in Greater Miami,

01:22:25.957 --> 01:22:29.486
authorities report the arrest last night
of a suspected vigilante.

01:22:29.586 --> 01:22:33.198
He is wanted for allegedly killing
at least ten suspected terrorists.

01:22:33.298 --> 01:22:36.034
The man, who has not yet
been identified by authorities,

01:22:36.134 --> 01:22:37.994
was transferred under heavy guard

01:22:38.094 --> 01:22:41.221
to the Southeast Military Assistance
Command headquarters in Atlanta,

01:22:41.473 --> 01:22:45.210
where the Emergency Governors'
Conference is still underway..

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:46.836
He is to be interrogated today

01:22:46.936 --> 01:22:50.898
by both state and federal military
and civilian agencies..

01:24:56.524 --> 01:25:01.445
- Maybe I should ask you.
- Yeah, see you around.

you'd like to say to the media?

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.955
Yeah.

Now it's your turn.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.838
One night you're gonna close your eyes

01:25:20.089 --> 01:25:24.509
and when they open, I'll be there.

01:25:25.303 --> 01:25:26.970
