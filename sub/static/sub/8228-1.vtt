INVESTIGATION...

09:23.563 --> 09:24.962
THREE...
...TAKES OFF.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.431
...TWO, ONE.

09:26.433 --> 09:33.004
¶¶

09:39.379 --> 09:40.444
¶¶

09:40.446 --> 09:42.981
Narrator:
TO CONTINUE THE RICH, VARIED,

09:42.983 --> 09:49.587
AND EXPLOSIVE
15-YEAR MYTHBUSTING LEGACY,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.256
BRIAN AND JON COMPETED

09:51.258 --> 09:54.259
AND EARNED THEIR PLACE
ON "THE SEARCH."

09:54.261 --> 09:55.994
IT'S EXPLOSIONS.
IT'S "MYTHBUSTERS."

09:55.996 --> 09:56.928
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.663
AND I WANT IT TO LAST FOREVER.

09:58.665 --> 09:59.931
Narrator: FROM A SIDEWAYS
EJECTION SEAT...

09:59.933 --> 10:00.998
[ ALL CHEERING ]
FIRE!

10:01.000 --> 10:04.535
...TO A MEDIEVAL
JUNKYARD CATAPULT...

10:04.537 --> 10:06.071
AND EVEN
DUCT TAPE BOAT SHOES...

10:06.073 --> 10:07.338
"HE'S REALLY DOING IT."

10:07.340 --> 10:10.341
...THEY DISPLAYED THE DESIGN
AND BUILD SKILLS,

10:10.343 --> 10:14.211
THE ENERGY, ENTHUSIASM,
AND LEADERSHIP

10:14.213 --> 10:15.613
TO BEAT EIGHT OTHER HOPEFULS...

10:15.615 --> 10:16.681
Kyle: BRIAN. JON.

10:16.683 --> 10:21.419
...AND PROVE THEY HAD
WHAT IT TAKES.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.888
AND SO,
THE NEW CHAPTER HAS BEGUN

10:23.890 --> 10:26.290
WITH A CAR-CRASH CATASTROPHE

10:26.292 --> 10:27.826
AND DELAYED DECAPITATION.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.895
WE'RE TESTING THE MOVIE TROPE
ABOUT DELAYED CAUSALITY.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.765
THAT'S IF A WEAPON CAN SLICE
THROUGH A VILLAIN'S NECK

10:33.767 --> 10:37.502
WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HIS HEAD
STAYS ON HIS SHOULDERS

10:37.504 --> 10:39.170
UNTIL IT SLIDES APART.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.972
FOR THE SWING,
IT'S ALL ABOUT TWO THINGS --

10:41.974 --> 10:44.241
FORCE AND CONTACT AREA...

10:44.243 --> 10:45.777
BECAUSE PRESSURE
IS FORCE DIVIDED BY AREA.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.912
IMAGINE GETTING SLAPPED
IN THE FACE BY A HAND.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.980
OH!

10:48.982 --> 10:51.783
THE AREA OF THE HAND'S
RATHER LARGE,

10:51.785 --> 10:53.785
SO THE PRESSURE'S NOT THAT MUCH.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.320
BUT IF YOU TURN THE HAND
INTO A BLADE

10:55.322 --> 10:56.587
AND APPLY THE SAME
AMOUNT OF FORCE,

10:56.589 --> 10:59.457
WELL, THEN THE PRESSURE
INCREASES DRAMATICALLY

10:59.459 --> 11:02.060
BECAUSE THE CONTACT AREA
IS MUCH SMALLER.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.661
SO THE SMALLER THE CONTACT AREA,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.530
THE BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE
THE CUT IS.

11:06.532 --> 11:07.799
Narrator:
THEIR BLADE IS SHARP...

11:07.801 --> 11:10.668
THE CONTACT AREA IS
AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.070
Jon: WE HAVE A WEAPON.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.871
SELFIE STICK!

11:13.873 --> 11:14.673
Narrator:
...MEANING THE ONLY VARIABLE

11:14.675 --> 11:18.076
IS THE FORCE OF THE SWING.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.010
AND NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED.

11:20.012 --> 11:25.817
HALF-SPEED SWORD TEST
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.951
¶¶

11:26.953 --> 11:31.156
Brian:
THAT WAS A GOOD CUT, MAN.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.957
BUT IT PUSHED IT
A LOT TO THE SIDE.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.159
Jon: YEAH.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.159
THE MORE TIME
MY BLADE SPENDS

11:35.161 --> 11:36.828
IN CONTACT
WITH THE ZOMBIE'S NECK,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.096
THERE'LL BE MORE MOVEMENT.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.499
SO WE WANT THE BLADE TO PASS
THROUGH THE ZOMBIE FASTER,

11:41.501 --> 11:42.566
WHICH MEANS LESS MOVEMENT.

11:42.568 --> 11:47.105
IN TRANSLATION,
WE NEED MORE SPEED.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.639
YOU READY
FOR THE FULL SPEED, JON?

11:48.641 --> 11:49.907
OH, YEAH.

11:49.909 --> 11:50.842
HERE WE GO.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.979
¶¶

11:54.981 --> 11:56.581
FULL-SPEED TEST

11:56.583 --> 11:59.784
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:59.786 --> 12:03.855
¶¶

12:03.857 --> 12:05.189
VERY NICE.
MM.

12:05.191 --> 12:09.527
SO, OUR SPEED TESTS WEREN'T
SPECTACULARLY CONCLUSIVE.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.596
I DID A HALF-SPEED SWING.
I DID A FULL-SPEED SWING.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.598
AND A FASTER SWING
MEANS LESS CONTACT TIME,

12:14.600 --> 12:15.934
WHICH SHOULD MEAN LESS MOVEMENT.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.336
BUT IT'S STILL HARD TO TELL
WITH THE HIGH-SPEED CAMERA.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.604
BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE --

12:19.606 --> 12:23.674
HUMAN SPEEDS JUST AREN'T
GONNA CUT IT -- LITERALLY.

12:23.676 --> 12:28.345
BUT THE MYTH IS WHETHER A
DRAMATIC PAUSE IS POSSIBLE EVER.

12:28.347 --> 12:32.484
SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO BUILD
A SWORD-SWINGING RIG

12:32.486 --> 12:34.084
TO GIVE US SUPER-HUMAN SPEEDS.

12:34.086 --> 12:39.690
¶¶

12:39.692 --> 12:41.826
Narrator:
BACK AT CAR-CRASH CENTRAL...

12:41.828 --> 12:43.160
Jon: WHOA!

12:43.162 --> 12:46.030
OOH!
OH!

12:46.032 --> 12:47.498
...BRIAN AND JON
HAVE DISCOVERED

12:47.500 --> 12:52.771
THAT A PASSENGER WITH THEIR FEET
ON TOP OF THE DASH IS IN DANGER.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.439
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
GOT HER!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.508
BUT IS IT, AS THE MYTH
WOULD SUGGEST...

12:56.510 --> 12:58.375
YOU GOT IT?
...MORTAL DANGER?

12:58.377 --> 13:01.112
BEFORE THEY LOOK AT LETHALITY
IN A ROAD TEST...

13:01.114 --> 13:04.449
IT'S A SHAME REGULAR MEDICINE
ISN'T THIS EASY.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.316
RIGHT?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.184
...THEY'RE DOING
A QUICK RESET.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.453
Brian:
LAST AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT

13:08.455 --> 13:10.655
WAS A FAIR AMOUNT
OF DESTRUCTION.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.789
GOOD AS NEW.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.190
LEGS WENT FLYING EVERYWHERE.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.927
BUT THIS TIME,
I EXPECT THOSE LEGS --

13:15.929 --> 13:19.063
THEY'RE PROJECTILES
STRAIGHT TO THE FACE.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.666
Narrator: YEP.
BRIAN THINKS HAVING YOUR FEET

13:21.668 --> 13:22.800
FLAT AGAINST THE DASH

13:22.802 --> 13:25.803
WOULD JETTISON YOUR KNEES
INTO YOUR FACE...

13:25.805 --> 13:26.337
JUST...

13:26.339 --> 13:27.872
[ LAUGHS ]

13:27.874 --> 13:32.544
...MEANING IT'S THE MOST LIKELY
POSITION TO CAUSE A FATALITY.

13:32.546 --> 13:33.945
DAMN IT.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.680
DO WE HAVE ANY GRIP TAPE?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.214
READY?

13:37.216 --> 13:38.817
YOUR MYTHBUSTERS
MANICURE SERVICE.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.218
WE GET RID OF YOUR CORNS,

13:40.220 --> 13:42.153
AND THEN PUT YOU IN A CAR
AND SET OFF THE AIRBAG.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.289
I'M SURPRISED
MORE PEOPLE DON'T CALL.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.290
BEAUTIFUL.

13:46.292 --> 13:50.295
THERE WE GO.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.762
OKAY. WHEW!

13:51.764 --> 13:54.499
TEST TWO
WITH FEET AGAINST THE DASH

13:54.501 --> 13:58.102
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.972
OH! OOH!
OH!

14:00.974 --> 14:03.507
ONCE AGAIN, IT'S CARNAGE
IN THE HALF CAR.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.642
LOOK AT THIS.
OH!

14:04.644 --> 14:08.246
WHETHER IT WAS ANY WORSE
IS DIFFICULT TO TELL,

14:08.248 --> 14:11.983
BUT IT'S CLEAR THE MYTH IS
HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.918
...ONE.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.053
OH!
OOH!

14:16.055 --> 14:18.722
OH, NO.

14:18.724 --> 14:22.526
Jon: WHEN WE WATCHED THE AIRBAG
DEPLOY IN REAL TIME,

14:22.528 --> 14:24.262
NOT TOO BAD.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.931
BUT THEN WE WATCHED
THE HIGH-SPEED,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.266
AND IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.600
THE AIRBAG GOES OFF.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.937
WE CAN SEE FROM HER TOES --
JUST SLOWLY CURLED BACK,

14:32.939 --> 14:35.139
AND YOU CAN JUST ALMOST IMAGINE
THE SOUND OF BONE

14:35.141 --> 14:40.878
AND MEAT CRUSHING AND TEARING
AS IT GOES [IMITATING TEARING]

14:40.880 --> 14:42.347
AND THEY FOLD BACK,
AND YOU THINK THAT IT'S OVER,

14:42.349 --> 14:45.616
BUT IT'S NOT, BECAUSE
THEN THEY SWING OUT THIS WAY.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.817
[ IMITATES EXPLOSION ]

14:46.819 --> 14:48.486
AND THEY HIT THE FLOOR.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.088
IT WAS HORRIFYING.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.555
WANT TO GRAB
HER FEETSIES?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.758
Narrator:
QUESTION IS, IS IT LETHAL?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.560
FOR THAT,
THEY NEED TO STEP IT UP

MEDICINE FOR OVER HALF A DECADE,

15:07.106 --> 15:09.306

I TAUGHT A NUMBER OF PARAMEDICS

OF HUMAN ANALOGUES.

15:20.519 --> 15:24.522
AS YOU CAN GET ON THIS ENTIRE
PLANET TO A HUMAN BEING

15:24.524 --> 15:27.925

15:48.949 --> 15:50.548
FROM TOUCHING IT
WITH OUR BARE HANDS.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.218

THAT EVERY FIBER OF MUSCLE...

15:54.220 --> 15:55.553
GIVE THE BICEPS
A SQUEEZE.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.422

17:35.655 --> 17:38.923
WHAT MAKES A SWORD
CUT EFFICIENTLY

17:38.925 --> 17:41.526
IS A PUSH AND A DRAW.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.326
THE DRAW'S ACTUALLY THE ACTION

17:42.328 --> 17:43.594
OF WHEN YOU PULL
THAT SWORD BACK,

17:43.596 --> 17:47.398
AND IT HAS TO BE A 1:1 RATIO
FOR AN EFFECTIVE CUT.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.802
SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T JUST BUILD
A RIG WHERE IT GOES "BOOP!"

17:51.804 --> 17:54.338
