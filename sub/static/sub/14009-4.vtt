00:00.926 --> 00:02.616
<i>Previously on Damages...</i>

00:02.727 --> 00:04.590
<i>I saw your
client on Charlie Rose.</i>

00:04.653 --> 00:06.183
<i>His English is better
than his French.</i>

00:06.317 --> 00:09.544
<i>Mr. Coupet, did you personally
oversee the development of</i>

00:09.615 --> 00:11.561
<i>a vaccine called Tranzec?</i>

00:11.660 --> 00:14.574
<i>We conduct clinical
trials for every drug we develop.</i>

00:14.656 --> 00:18.266
<i>Did you ever have occasion
to hear the term, "adverse event"?</i>

00:18.350 --> 00:21.803
<i>A wrongful death suit was filed against
you and High Star in federal court.</i>

00:21.893 --> 00:23.712
<i>The plaintiff's attorney
is Ellen Parsons.</i>

00:23.810 --> 00:26.816
<i>The brief lists a single
witness, Christopher Sanchez.</i>

00:26.883 --> 00:28.618
<i>Mr. Sanchez
came forward as a witness.</i>

00:28.687 --> 00:31.304
<i>He claimed that High Star was
involved in illegal activity</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:33.142
<i>that led to the
deaths of three men.</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:35.027
<i>I never liked
that last mission.</i>

00:35.097 --> 00:38.447
<i>Lawsuit's been filed.
The company cannot have you talking.</i>

00:38.540 --> 00:40.344
<i>Mr. Sanchez, in
previous conversations, do you</i>

00:40.428 --> 00:43.916
<i>recall stating that you were
involved in an illegal operation?</i>

00:44.004 --> 00:45.534
<i>I don't ever
recall saying that.</i>

00:46.019 --> 00:47.895
<i>What are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!</i>

00:49.982 --> 00:51.154
<i>They got him to lie.</i>

00:51.227 --> 00:53.549
<i>I think they were going
after somebody over there.</i>

<i>Praise God...</i>

02:09.407 --> 02:10.977
<i>and good evening.</i>

02:13.594 --> 02:15.770
<i>It fills my heart with joy to
be here with you tonight.</i>

02:18.571 --> 02:22.009
<i>This week my six-year-old son
made a Christmas card for me.</i>

02:25.224 --> 02:29.552
<i>It said, "Peace on Earth,
good will to all men."</i>

02:30.934 --> 02:32.651
<i>Peace on Earth.</i>

02:50.101 --> 02:51.275
<i>Chris?</i>

02:52.276 --> 02:55.755
<i>I didn't know you were home.
How are you?</i>

02:56.688 --> 02:57.960
<i>I'm good.</i>

03:03.490 --> 03:04.940
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

03:07.045 --> 03:08.597
<i>I had to come back.</i>

03:08.975 --> 03:10.061
<i>Why?</i>

03:22.398 --> 03:23.887
You know why.

03:41.820 --> 03:42.670
<i>Hey!</i>

03:43.001 --> 03:44.066
<i>I missed you last night.</i>

03:44.631 --> 03:49.273
<i>Oh.
I got hung up at work. Sorry.</i>

03:49.412 --> 03:50.994
<i>You spent the night
at your desk, didn't you?</i>

03:51.346 --> 03:54.638
<i>Where are you?
Let's, uh, have lunch later.</i>

03:54.808 --> 03:57.230
<i>I'm on my way to the airport.</i>

03:57.997 --> 04:00.220
<i>Right. Of course.</i>

04:00.449 --> 04:02.050
<i>Have a good time at your folks.</i>

04:02.131 --> 04:04.872
<i>Wish them "Merry Christmas" for me.
Travel safe.</i>

04:05.801 --> 04:08.433
<i>- Merry Christmas, Ellen.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

04:09.090 --> 04:10.176
<i>Ho-ho-ho.</i>

05:18.068 --> 05:19.099
<i>This is bullshit, Patty.</i>

05:19.183 --> 05:20.867
<i>You have no respect
for my client.</i>

05:21.223 --> 05:24.009
<i>You know, if you insist on
additional days to depose</i>

05:24.089 --> 05:27.591
<i>Mr. Coupet, you have to do
it in a timely manner.</i>

05:27.677 --> 05:30.037
<i>I'm not gonna depose
him until I'm fully prepared.</i>

05:30.125 --> 05:32.626
<i>Fine.
I'm gonna get the judge to compel you.</i>

05:33.305 --> 05:34.785
<i>Good.
Give it your best shot.</i>

05:35.569 --> 05:37.065
<i>I'm sure the judge will
understand that it takes a</i>

05:37.156 --> 05:39.786
<i>a little time to read ten-years
worth of clinical trials.</i>

05:39.931 --> 05:42.593
<i>- You've had time.
- A month, Jim.</i>

05:43.471 --> 05:45.800
<i>Springtime in Paris
is not so bad.</i>

05:53.902 --> 05:55.136
<i>It looks like that went well.</i>

05:56.530 --> 05:59.804
<i>I don't want you to have to jeopardize
your other case by helping me.</i>

05:59.966 --> 06:03.632
<i>Don't worry about it.
It's good to let them stew.</i>

06:07.037 --> 06:08.375
<i>What's wrong?</i>

06:09.231 --> 06:10.440
<i>It's Chris.</i>

06:11.260 --> 06:12.931
<i>I don't know if he's safe.</i>

06:13.022 --> 06:14.719
<i>I don't even know if he's alive.</i>

06:15.975 --> 06:18.101
<i>Are you getting
emotionally involved?</i>

06:19.481 --> 06:22.154
<i>No. No.</i>

06:23.468 --> 06:24.723
<i>Don't.</i>

06:26.126 --> 06:28.704
<i>It'll affect your judgment.
You'll make mistakes.</i>

06:40.823 --> 06:42.036
<i>I'm here to see Ellen Parsons.</i>

06:42.159 --> 06:43.173
<i>And your name is, sir?</i>

06:43.262 --> 06:44.675
<i>Christopher Sanchez.</i>

06:48.083 --> 06:49.520
- <i>You can wait in here.
- Thank you.</i>

06:49.628 --> 06:52.155
<i>And there's coffee and tea right out there.
Help yourself.</i>

07:07.385 --> 07:08.447
<i>Ellen...</i>

07:10.417 --> 07:13.529
<i>I want you to seriously
reconsider pursuing this case.</i>

07:14.624 --> 07:18.470
<i>I appreciate you concern,
Patty, I do, but it's fine.</i>

07:19.262 --> 07:20.166
<i>- Ms. Parsons.
- Yes?</i>

07:20.327 --> 07:23.037
<i>There's a Mr. Sanchez waiting
for you in conference room two.</i>

07:46.628 --> 07:49.041
<i>- Ms. Parsons?
- Who are you?</i>

07:49.147 --> 07:52.475
<i>My name is Nasim Marwat.
That is for you.</i>

07:53.944 --> 07:55.749
<i>Did you tell reception
you were Chris Sanchez?</i>

07:55.862 --> 07:57.144
<i>Only so I could see you.</i>

07:57.548 --> 07:58.703
<i>Call security, please.</i>

07:58.818 --> 08:02.049
<i>No, no, please.
Chris Sanchez sent me. I'm his friend.</i>

08:03.190 --> 08:04.154
<i>You see?</i>

08:14.786 --> 08:16.116
<i>This is from Chris.</i>

08:21.439 --> 08:24.469
<i>She's a real
pretty lady, this church.</i>

08:26.650 --> 08:29.012
<i>The restoration's
picture- perfect.</i>

08:29.831 --> 08:33.379
<i>Well, that was only
possible because of you.</i>

08:33.706 --> 08:34.878
<i>We're all grateful.</i>

08:35.005 --> 08:37.340
<i>There's no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:43.409
<i>So what's on your you mind?</i>

08:45.800 --> 08:48.138
<i>I've been
struggling with Christmas Eve.</i>

08:51.000 --> 08:53.551
<i>You're having second thoughts
about giving the guest sermon?</i>

08:53.854 --> 08:55.999
<i>No, no.
I'm-I'm honored to do that.</i>

08:56.188 --> 08:59.296
<i>I just want to be sure I have
something worthwhile to talk about.</i>

08:59.808 --> 09:00.880
<i>Of course.</i>

09:02.495 --> 09:05.988
<i>When Mary Alice was alive, she
was my ears for this sort of thing.</i>

09:06.120 --> 09:07.641
<i>I'm kinda lost without her.</i>

09:08.058 --> 09:12.551
<i>I must've filled a dozen wastebaskets
with-with crumpled paper.</i>

09:13.100 --> 09:14.520
<i>It happens to all of us.</i>

09:16.111 --> 09:20.315
<i>I've been reading my Bible,
studying my favorite passages.</i>

09:21.492 --> 09:24.310
<i>I don't just want to talk
about what matters to me.</i>

09:24.438 --> 09:26.815
<i>I want to speak to the
whole congregation.</i>

09:27.857 --> 09:34.317
<i>Howard, that's my job.
You're a unique man with a unique perspective.</i>

09:34.431 --> 09:36.094
<i>That's why I asked you to speak.</i>

09:36.280 --> 09:40.554
<i>The congregation can be enlightened
by your point of view.</i>

09:41.402 --> 09:42.794
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

09:44.272 --> 09:46.781
<i>Trust that God can lead
you down the right path.</i>

09:49.002 --> 09:52.196
<i>And remember that the
faithful heart never errs.</i>

10:06.762 --> 10:08.078
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

10:08.433 --> 10:10.911
<i>Chris gave it to my father
so that I could bring it to you.</i>

10:14.346 --> 10:15.766
<i>And how do you know Chris?</i>

10:15.867 --> 10:18.289
<i>I helped him with
his work-- The missions.</i>

10:18.984 --> 10:24.833
<i>I would scout the region, I talk to the
people, I translate, I gather information.</i>

10:24.939 --> 10:26.787
<i>Mr. Marwat, are you
employed by High Star?</i>

10:26.880 --> 10:28.013
<i>No.</i>

10:28.359 --> 10:29.970
<i>I only do this for Chris.</i>

10:30.653 --> 10:33.218
<i>My family and Chris,
we have the same enemy.</i>

10:34.147 --> 10:37.232
<i>You see, my father, he was
educated in the West.</i>

10:37.831 --> 10:41.922
<i>We love our country, but the
Taliban, they destroy it.</i>

10:43.543 --> 10:46.440
<i>On Chris's last mission,
three of his men were killed.</i>

10:46.933 --> 10:49.622
<i>- Yes, that is true.
- Do you know the purpose of that mission?</i>

10:50.864 --> 10:53.501
<i>They go to a village, and
then they take someone away.</i>

10:55.466 --> 10:56.653
<i>Who did they take?</i>

10:57.517 --> 10:58.838
<i>An Afghan.</i>

10:58.971 --> 11:00.249
<i>And that's all I know.</i>

11:02.610 --> 11:04.636
<i>And why did they take him?</i>

11:04.743 --> 11:06.636
<i>Every mission
they take someone away.</i>

11:07.455 --> 11:09.126
<i>Dangerous men who
have knowledge.</i>

11:10.355 --> 11:12.182
<i>What did Chris's unit
do with these men?</i>

11:12.417 --> 11:13.392
<i>Interrogate them.</i>

11:13.512 --> 11:15.997
<i>They asked them questions to
find out what they knew.</i>

11:17.729 --> 11:20.281
<i>Chris explained
this to my father.</i>

11:22.875 --> 11:24.829
<i>And now my father is dead.</i>

11:27.459 --> 11:30.192
<i>That company is responsible
for murdering my father.</i>

11:31.702 --> 11:33.300
<i>I'm so sorry, Mr.
Marwat.</i>

11:35.000 --> 11:36.924
<i>Do you know where Chris is now?</i>

11:38.453 --> 11:41.645
<i>Um, no.
I looked, but he is nowhere.</i>

11:47.757 --> 11:50.903
<i>Did anyone else know that
you were assisting Mr. Sanchez?</i>

11:51.661 --> 11:52.968
<i>No, no one.</i>

11:54.128 --> 11:59.622
<i>Chris's unit that you were
referring to, was it... these men?</i>

12:00.383 --> 12:01.348
<i>Yes.</i>

12:01.657 --> 12:04.455
<i>But, um, on the final mission,
there was another--</i>

12:04.546 --> 12:06.701
<i>An American that I've
never seen before.</i>

12:10.577 --> 12:12.877
<i>I'm sorry I do not have
more information.</i>

12:12.989 --> 12:17.201
<i>I've only seen him once,
and he never saw me.</i>

12:23.401 --> 12:25.687
<i>So they were
interrogating terror suspects.</i>

12:25.877 --> 12:26.840
<i>Sounds like it.</i>

12:27.628 --> 12:30.414
<i>Unfortunately, Marwat is
worthless as a witness.</i>

12:30.793 --> 12:32.295
<i>I know.
It's all hearsay unless we can</i>

12:32.394 --> 12:34.200
<i>find some other way to
confirm his story.</i>

12:35.411 --> 12:38.780
<i>If High Star was running some
sort of terrorist extraction</i>

12:38.865 --> 12:40.850
<i>program, they couldn't
have done it alone.</i>

12:41.879 --> 12:45.603
<i>Someone in the government would
have had to have known about it.</i>

12:48.758 --> 12:50.557
<i>Sorry. It's my mom.</i>

12:50.649 --> 12:52.619
<i>I was supposed to meet her to
do some Christmas shopping.</i>

12:53.208 --> 12:55.833
<i>Go ahead, talk to her.
I'm going to go out.</i>

12:57.430 --> 12:59.871
<i>I think I know someone who
might be able to help us.</i>

13:00.225 --> 13:01.541
<i>- I'll come with you.
- No, no.</i>

13:01.693 --> 13:03.413
<i>That'd be a little tricky.</i>

13:04.041 --> 13:05.300
<i>Check in with me later.</i>

13:07.503 --> 13:10.621
<i>Hey, Mom.
Are you there?</i>

13:10.942 --> 13:12.707
<i>Where are you?
Are you okay?</i>

13:13.011 --> 13:16.581
<i>I'm fine. I was going to call you.
I got stuck in a meeting.</i>

13:16.754 --> 13:18.002
<i>Are you going to come shopping?</i>

13:18.169 --> 13:19.401
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

13:19.563 --> 13:21.946
<i>I'm looking at
these bracelets again.</i>

13:22.123 --> 13:27.312
<i>They're all so pretty. I can't decide
which one Aunt Laurie would like.</i>

13:27.404 --> 13:28.724
<i>I need your eye, Ellie.</i>

13:28.855 --> 13:31.475
<i>I'm sorry, Mom, I just-- I don't
think I'm going to make it today.</i>

13:32.423 --> 13:35.570
<i>That's okay, sweetheart.
I know your work's important.</i>

13:35.696 --> 13:39.371
<i>Listen, we'll pick something
out for Laurie tomorrow, okay?</i>

13:39.790 --> 13:42.532
<i>A potential witness has just
shown up out of nowhere.</i>

13:42.896 --> 13:44.871
<i>Ooh, exciting.
Who is it?</i>

13:45.361 --> 13:47.056
<i>Mom, you know I
can't talk about it.</i>

13:47.211 --> 13:51.111
<i>You always keep the
juicy details from me.</i>

13:51.265 --> 13:54.765
<i>An Afghani man.
But that's all I can say.</i>

13:54.932 --> 13:58.137
<i>Well, good luck.
I'll take a rain check for tomorrow.</i>

13:58.297 --> 13:59.302
<i>Bye, Mom.</i>

14:02.208 --> 14:03.452
<i>That's impossible.</i>

14:04.012 --> 14:06.163
<i>Who else at High
Star knew about the program?</i>

14:06.935 --> 14:10.434
<i>Carter and Sanchez.
You knew that.</i>

14:10.590 --> 14:12.580
<i>I know that's what you told me.</i>

14:12.780 --> 14:14.654
<i>I've withheld nothing from you.</i>

14:14.949 --> 14:17.757
<i>Well, somehow there's
a new witness in town.</i>

14:18.489 --> 14:20.262
<i>We got to find
out who this guy is.</i>

14:21.359 --> 14:23.857
<i>I'm supposed to be meeting with the
Defense Department next week.</i>

14:24.477 --> 14:27.911
<i>There's $60 million in
contracts on the line here.</i>

14:28.166 --> 14:31.072
<i>Any chance Chris Sanchez
had something to do with this?</i>

14:31.751 --> 14:33.398
<i>Carter has Sanchez locked down.</i>

14:33.591 --> 14:36.064
<i>Sanchez could have
sent someone back here.</i>

14:39.147 --> 14:40.399
<i>Maybe.</i>

14:41.832 --> 14:44.076
<i>Shouldn't be
too tough to find out.</i>

14:45.022 --> 14:46.590
<i>You know how to get answers.</i>

14:48.436 --> 14:50.281
<i>Sanchez is an American citizen.</i>

14:50.936 --> 14:54.078
<i>There are no rules.
We need information.</i>

14:54.982 --> 14:56.793
<i>Who the fuck cares
how we get it?</i>

15:00.702 --> 15:02.298
<i>I'm not going to do
that to one of my own men.</i>

15:02.410 --> 15:03.632
<i>I'm not going to
give that order.</i>

15:08.864 --> 15:14.026
<i>You either believe in what
we're doing or you don't, Howard.</i>

15:18.709 --> 15:20.341
<i>I'm going to go check
with my sources.</i>

15:44.220 --> 15:47.600
<i>Hey, next one's on me,
Blondie. What's your poison?</i>

15:48.022 --> 15:49.459
<i>It's 11:00 a.m.</i>

15:49.637 --> 15:51.637
<i>Oh, I know, I know.
I could have been here earlier,</i>

15:51.753 --> 15:53.674
<i>except I couldn't find my socks.</i>

15:56.272 --> 16:00.761
<i>Which reminds me of a story
about the chimp with the clap.</i>

16:00.994 --> 16:02.716
<i>No one wants to hear it, Bill.</i>

16:07.550 --> 16:12.434
<i>Holy shit. Patty Hewes.</i>

16:16.327 --> 16:19.992
<i>Your landlord gave me a
couple of suggestions of where</i>

16:20.111 --> 16:26.260
<i>you might be drowning yourself, so, uh...
I came by for a little conversation.</i>

16:26.383 --> 16:30.498
<i>What conversation?
About what?</i>

16:31.938 --> 16:34.710
<i>About something near
and dear to your heart.</i>

16:37.122 --> 16:38.587
<i>That's not possible.</i>

16:38.931 --> 16:41.437
<i>What about
extraordinary rendition?</i>

16:43.243 --> 16:48.063
<i>I assume that in between drinks, you've been
following Howard Erickson and High Star.</i>

16:50.434 --> 16:51.676
<i>What about them?</i>

16:52.959 --> 16:56.352
<i>I've been hearing
rumors that Erickson may be</i>

16:56.452 --> 16:58.807
<i>running his own
in-house operation.</i>

16:59.519 --> 17:02.158
<i>Seizing and interrogating
terror suspects.</i>

17:02.538 --> 17:06.590
<i>Mm... Erickson would be insane
to go that far off the reservation.</i>

17:07.464 --> 17:10.411
<i>High Star's not sanctioned for
intelligence operations.</i>

17:11.938 --> 17:15.058
<i>He'd lose his company,
that ever got out.</i>

17:15.192 --> 17:17.672
<i>Yeah, but what if
Erickson was being protected?</i>

17:22.428 --> 17:24.778
<i>The schmuck had better be if
he's going to run a program like that.</i>

17:25.988 --> 17:27.565
<i>So, what are we saying here?</i>

17:29.421 --> 17:31.910
<i>You got your sights set on
taking down High Star?</i>

17:32.567 --> 17:34.419
<i>No. Not me.</i>

17:35.962 --> 17:38.146
<i>One of my associates--
Ellen Parsons.</i>

17:39.294 --> 17:40.636
<i>Never heard of her.</i>

17:41.907 --> 17:46.025
<i>Well, if she wanted
confirmation that High Star was</i>

17:46.141 --> 17:50.228
<i>running a program like that,
how would she get it?</i>

17:51.429 --> 17:54.099
<i>Patty, nobody's taken
my calls for the last 15 years.</i>

17:54.439 --> 17:57.862
<i>Including you. How the fuck
do I know how she'd get it?</i>

18:01.477 --> 18:04.289
<i>You know, I'm sure you
still have a few drinking</i>

18:04.418 --> 18:07.280
<i>buddies lurking in
the shadows of D.C.</i>

18:09.680 --> 18:11.048
<i>You owe me, Bill.</i>

18:14.291 --> 18:16.073
<i>Buy yourself a couple of rounds.</i>

18:16.967 --> 18:18.121
<i>Think about it.</i>

18:39.096 --> 18:42.778
<i>Boormanjahn.
What can I do for you?</i>

18:47.203 --> 18:49.833
<i>How are your ties
in the Afghan community?</i>

18:50.344 --> 18:52.528
<i>I have some eyes and ears.</i>

18:53.052 --> 18:55.350
<i>- How's your Pashto?
- A little rusty.</i>

18:56.794 --> 18:58.192
<i>What have you got?</i>

18:58.681 --> 19:00.965
<i>Someone has just
arrived from Afghanistan.</i>

19:01.122 --> 19:02.328
<i>He's dangerous.</i>

19:02.710 --> 19:05.234
<i>I need you to find him
before he does any damage.</i>

19:06.179 --> 19:08.070
<i>Some details would be helpful.</i>

19:08.238 --> 19:10.713
<i>I'm guessing he's
from the Kunar Province,</i>

19:10.813 --> 19:13.602
<i>or at least he spent time just
south of the Hindu Kush.</i>

19:13.866 --> 19:16.203
<i>As for his tribe, I'd
say Kom Nuristani.</i>

19:16.467 --> 19:19.046
<i>Start there. That's all I got.</i>

19:22.371 --> 19:24.562
<i>Excellent. I-I will be happy
to look for the next year.</i>

19:27.107 --> 19:31.425
<i>You don't find him, I'll be happy
to revoke your immigration status.</i>

19:32.821 --> 19:36.235
<i>Boormanjahn, there's
no need to talk like this.</i>

19:40.641 --> 19:41.832
<i>I will search.</i>

19:52.708 --> 19:55.367

<i>Please come back.
You're welcome anytime.</i>

23:02.093 --> 23:03.320
<i>You are sure you're not hungry?</i>

23:03.452 --> 23:05.514
<i>I'm fine, thank you.</i>

23:07.938 --> 23:10.840
<i>I, uh, I was hoping you could
help me with something.</i>

23:11.779 --> 23:13.638
<i>Have you ever seen these
initials before?</i>

23:13.916 --> 23:15.789
<i>Certainly.
This is the Double Dees.</i>

23:15.998 --> 23:19.711
- <i>- The Double Dees?
- Chris and his men, they call themselves this.</i>

23:20.191 --> 23:22.987
<i>- What does it mean?
- I do not know.</i>

23:28.289 --> 23:30.849
<i>I really appreciate you
coming all this way, Mr. Marwat.</i>

23:31.435 --> 23:32.772
<i>You should thank Chris.</i>

23:32.939 --> 23:34.752
<i>He told my father
to send me here.</i>

23:35.824 --> 23:39.656
<i>The last time I saw Chris, he, uh, he was
going through a very difficult time.</i>

23:39.937 --> 23:42.842
<i>Did your father say anything
about his state of mind?</i>

23:44.975 --> 23:50.448
<i>When, um, when Chris came to visit
my father, he, he wished to apologize.</i>

23:51.261 --> 23:52.255
<i>For what?</i>

23:54.054 --> 23:59.947
<i>For the company, for the work, for the
taking of the men who do not return.</i>

24:00.906 --> 24:03.963
<i>Do you believe that High Star
tortured the men that they took?</i>

24:04.829 --> 24:07.037
<i>Chris, he did not
speak to me of this.</i>

24:09.814 --> 24:14.516
<i>But you know, sometimes it happens
that they take the wrong men.</i>

24:15.445 --> 24:17.008
<i>The men who are innocent.</i>

24:21.977 --> 24:26.405
<i>Chris, he, uh, he explained
this regret to my father.</i>

24:30.313 --> 24:31.943
<i>I see Chris means a lot to you.</i>

24:33.024 --> 24:34.500
<i>To me also.</i>

24:35.537 --> 24:37.688
<i>I will do whatever I
can to help him.</i>

24:40.073 --> 24:41.290
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:43.629 --> 24:47.173
<i>I'm telling you, man, I don't
know what you're talking about.</i>

24:48.665 --> 24:50.815
<i>Then why did you want to
meet with Zafar Marwat alone?</i>

24:50.926 --> 24:53.222
<i>He's my own personal
contact; he's a friend!</i>

24:53.678 --> 24:55.147
<i>- Your friend?
- Yeah!</i>

24:56.003 --> 24:57.379
<i>Your friends are my friends.</i>

24:57.939 --> 24:59.320
<i>Aren't we all on the same side?</i>

24:59.490 --> 25:04.819
<i>Marwat-- He's plugged
into tribal politics.</i>

25:04.921 --> 25:07.795
<i>If he knows something about Nur
Taraki, I just wanted to make</i>

25:07.883 --> 25:11.207
<i>him feel comfortable with telling
me, so I went alone, okay?</i>

25:13.144 --> 25:14.816
<i>Sorry, man, I
just don't buy it.</i>

25:18.370 --> 25:21.325
<i>Did you have the old man pass on a
message about the Double Dees for you?</i>

25:21.479 --> 25:26.949
<i>- No! - You understand
why I can't trust you, right, Chris?</i>

25:28.343 --> 25:30.010
<i>No, you started this thing.</i>

25:31.362 --> 25:34.932
<i>You sidestepped company channels
and you talked to a lawyer.</i>

25:36.566 --> 25:42.482
<i>What you did may directly jeopardize High
Star's ability to protect our country.</i>

25:42.645 --> 25:44.385
<i>- Protect our country?
- Yes.</i>

25:45.093 --> 25:46.573
<i>Protect our country.</i>

25:47.258 --> 25:49.117
<i>You really think that's
what we were doing?</i>

25:49.221 --> 25:54.175
<i>- Absolutely. - Uh-uh.
No, it's not so simple, A.C.</i>

25:57.759 --> 25:59.138
<i>Chris...</i>

26:11.681 --> 26:16.692
<i>Come on, man. Don't make this
any harder than it has to be.</i>

26:18.208 --> 26:21.090
<i>Now, you sent someone to New
York with information.</i>

26:21.436 --> 26:23.730
- <i>Give me a name.
- Or what?</i>

26:32.079 --> 26:33.989
<i>What are you gonna do to me?</i>

26:40.355 --> 26:41.566
<i>Thanks for the call.</i>

26:41.675 --> 26:42.939
<i>A man has come in several times.</i>

26:43.149 --> 26:45.157
He says he's recently
arrived from Laghman.

26:47.715 --> 26:49.052
What's he look like?

26:50.873 --> 26:52.119
See for yourself.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.796
My God, how much money
you spend on this place?

27:02.672 --> 27:08.390
I mean, it's nice. A little antiseptic,
could use a bit more flash.

27:08.686 --> 27:10.109
But you did good.

27:10.549 --> 27:11.942
I'm glad you approve.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.276
- Can I get some of this bourbon?
- No.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.101
You wanted to see me?

27:25.207 --> 27:29.364
Yes.
Ellen Parsons, William Herndon.

27:30.702 --> 27:32.759
- Wow.
- Don't.

27:32.966 --> 27:35.272
Relax, I learned my lesson.

27:35.842 --> 27:38.148
We behave in the
workplace now, don't we?

27:38.833 --> 27:41.021
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

27:43.935 --> 27:45.027
Mr.
Herndon can make

27:45.122 --> 27:48.436
some inquires about High
Star on your behalf.

27:48.887 --> 27:50.343
Let me brass tack it for you.

27:51.268 --> 27:52.775
If I can get someone to talk...

27:54.314 --> 27:56.616
you're going to have a hell
of a bull's-eye on your back.

27:56.877 --> 27:57.812
I understand.

27:57.911 --> 28:00.578
Bullshit.
Bullshit you understand.

28:01.530 --> 28:05.054
You fuck this up, and your
career will be flushed down the

28:05.157 --> 28:06.491
shitter faster than you can say,

28:06.586 --> 28:08.660
"The American people
have a right to know."

28:10.190 --> 28:11.168
I get it.

28:13.222 --> 28:16.517
You've got a
life ahead of you, huh?

28:17.297 --> 28:20.596
So you make damn sure this is what
you want before I go any further.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.373
It's your call, Ellen.

28:25.889 --> 28:27.849
We don't have to go
through with this.

28:33.257 --> 28:38.350
If this is the only way to
confirm Mr. Marwat's story, then...

28:40.423 --> 28:43.604
please, get all the
facts that you can.

28:44.245 --> 28:45.949
I'll handle the consequences.

29:26.653 --> 29:27.839
Who the hell was that?

29:28.796 --> 29:34.585
My first job out of law school was
at a firm where Bill was a junior partner.

29:34.817 --> 29:36.584
How come I have
never heard of him?

29:36.953 --> 29:38.721
Because about ten
years ago he made a decision

29:38.821 --> 29:42.923
that cost him his practice.
He was disbarred.

29:44.082 --> 29:45.143
Now he...

29:47.437 --> 29:48.965
He drinks.

29:49.131 --> 29:51.490
Why do we want him
involved in this case?

29:52.204 --> 29:54.609
Because he's the only
person I know who could possibly

29:54.716 --> 29:56.740
get us the information
that we need.

29:58.444 --> 30:02.601
- Can we trust him?
- I certainly hope so.

31:04.182 --> 31:05.277
Get in the car.

31:29.076 --> 31:31.282
The agency's
got a tail on me now?

31:31.687 --> 31:33.392
What are you doing
hanging around a mosque?

31:33.596 --> 31:35.915
My job--
Following up on a tip.

31:36.032 --> 31:37.768
And you just screwed
it up for me.

31:37.867 --> 31:40.573
File your goddamn reports, I won't
have to shanghai you on the street.

31:41.425 --> 31:44.001
You know I always
take off for holidays.

31:45.415 --> 31:48.475
So what's going on with this
wrongful death suit against High Star?

31:49.625 --> 31:51.118
It's got nothing to do with us.

31:52.291 --> 31:55.639
A couple of High Star
contractors were K.I.A.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.939
Now some ambulance chasers
are going after the company.

32:00.176 --> 32:02.699
So the case isn't
related to Double Dee?

32:03.668 --> 32:06.763
Of course not.
The program was already over.

32:07.100 --> 32:09.765
The brass went and
yanked the plug on it.

32:09.923 --> 32:15.500
So, now the war's entering its second decade,
and all you geniuses are getting promoted.

32:20.123 --> 32:23.183
Boorman, I don't know whose dick you
greased to get this far, but if I find out

32:23.300 --> 32:26.829
that you're lying to me, you're
withholding intel, you're so

32:26.954 --> 32:30.134
much as farting without filing
a report, you are done.

32:31.703 --> 32:34.416
You'll never be
heard from again.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.295
Is that clear?

32:40.737 --> 32:42.424
No, can you repeat it?

32:42.535 --> 32:44.113
Get the fuck out of my car.

32:56.636 --> 32:58.664
Praise God.
And good evening.

32:59.457 --> 33:02.198
It fills my heart with
joy being with your...

33:02.313 --> 33:03.953
being here with you tonight.

33:04.332 --> 33:08.187
I'd like to express my gratitude to Pastor
Yates for giving me this opportunity.

33:09.944 --> 33:10.941
Fuck.

33:14.007 --> 33:14.833
Yeah.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.337
I saw the son of
a bitch, but I lost him.

33:17.557 --> 33:18.586
Who is he?

33:18.755 --> 33:20.907
I don't know his
name-- Just what he looks like.

33:21.148 --> 33:22.582
You get anything from Sanchez?

33:22.721 --> 33:24.334
Nothing we can use.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.450
What the fuck
are you doing, Howard?

33:27.698 --> 33:30.854
A man is running around this
goddamn city talking to lawyers.

33:30.952 --> 33:32.000
Push harder.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.893
Calm yourself, Jerry.

33:33.992 --> 33:36.109
Stop being
sentimental about Sanchez.

33:36.278 --> 33:39.667
It's information. It don't mean a
lick of shit who you get it from.

33:39.833 --> 33:42.501
Now, pull your head out of
your ass and give the order.

33:46.812 --> 33:50.042
So, Chris Sanchez
is involved in your case.

33:50.209 --> 33:52.757
- Which one?
- That one, the blue one.

33:52.996 --> 33:56.189
My gosh, that boy broke your
heart junior year. Tore it in two.

33:57.131 --> 33:59.267
Broke my heart?
That's a little strong, Mom.

33:59.418 --> 34:00.334
It's good.

34:00.461 --> 34:02.698
Your father and I thought
you'd never stop crying.

34:04.228 --> 34:05.425
I don't remember that.

34:05.588 --> 34:07.091
You really think
Aunt Laurie would like it?

34:07.220 --> 34:09.328
Yeah, it's lovely,
mom; you should get it.

34:35.147 --> 34:36.719
Because you've been good.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.600
I've been really good.

34:39.712 --> 34:41.428
You have been really good.

34:41.590 --> 34:44.214
How many cookies do you
think Santa wants?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.754
How many-- You think three?

34:48.835 --> 34:50.791
That's a good idea.
Want to put them on his plate?

34:52.190 --> 34:53.196
Hello?

34:53.404 --> 34:54.596
Any word from Herndon?

34:54.742 --> 34:57.349
No.
Bill hasn't gotten in touch yet.

34:57.442 --> 34:58.936
I think we're just
going to have to wait.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.172
Well, I can't-- I can't
just wait around anymore.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.440
Where can I find him?

35:10.467 --> 35:12.163
- Sir.
- Merry Christmas.

35:12.934 --> 35:14.879
Sorry, sir, still nothing.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.940
I'm not diddling
around here, Carter.

35:18.245 --> 35:20.996
We need details. Step it up.

35:21.936 --> 35:24.133
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

35:25.016 --> 35:28.669
- Sir? - National
security is on the line here.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.342
It's not a time for hesitation.

35:32.362 --> 35:35.264
We need to know how our security
has been breached, and you're

35:35.370 --> 35:37.312
the only one who can find out.

35:37.813 --> 35:39.571
I'm giving you an order.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.397
How far do you want me to go?

35:44.730 --> 35:46.822
As far as you have to.

36:08.344 --> 36:09.919
Matthew 5:9.

36:10.121 --> 36:13.217
I know it's a well-worn
passage. Not very original.

36:13.326 --> 36:16.653
Well, there's nothing in the scripture
that doesn't warrant further exploration.

36:16.837 --> 36:20.099
I want to make sure that
you approve of my interpretation.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.824
Did you like the speech?

36:24.002 --> 36:25.589
Do you believe
in what you wrote?

36:28.250 --> 36:29.345
You have doubts.

36:29.513 --> 36:32.007
No.
That's what I believe.

36:32.514 --> 36:33.988
Then you need to share it.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.729
- I don't see him.
- What does he look like?

36:41.587 --> 36:44.326
He's in his 70s, kinda rumpled.

36:45.718 --> 36:46.779
Is that him?

36:46.928 --> 36:50.356
- Mr. Herndon?
- Ah, look, it's Nancy Drew.

36:50.477 --> 36:53.312
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Uh, no, thanks.

36:53.433 --> 36:54.608
Cash me out, will you, Stu?

36:55.691 --> 36:58.073
Mr. Herndon, we
haven't heard from you.

36:58.167 --> 37:00.107
Did you find anything
on High Star?

37:00.532 --> 37:02.439
Oh, shit.
This will never cover it.

37:02.532 --> 37:04.961
Hey, do me a favor.
Spot me, will ya, sweetheart?

37:05.096 --> 37:06.303
I'll get you back next time.

37:06.402 --> 37:07.716
Did you find anything?

37:09.458 --> 37:11.727
Oh, sorry, I struck out.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.851
- Mr. Herndon...
- Hey, listen,

37:14.931 --> 37:16.785
I gotta go. It's Christmas eve.

37:16.877 --> 37:18.515
Got a lot of chimneys
to hit, you know?

37:20.004 --> 37:22.168
Oh, hey, thanks for
picking up the check.

37:22.284 --> 37:23.805
And make sure Stu
gets a nice tip.

37:24.135 --> 37:27.765
- And-and who are you?
- Her mother.

37:27.922 --> 37:30.250
Yeah. Why not? Bye.

37:34.133 --> 37:38.922
Praise God.
And good evening.

37:40.516 --> 37:42.877
It fills my heart with joy
to be here with you tonight.

37:43.733 --> 37:48.567
This week, my six-year-old son made
me a Christmas card in art class.

37:51.187 --> 37:54.500
It said, "Peace on Earth,
good will to all men."

37:58.152 --> 38:00.172
Peace on Earth.

38:04.472 --> 38:05.809
You're making a mistake.

38:07.478 --> 38:14.214
Someone...
is talking to that attorney in New York.

38:15.909 --> 38:16.970
I want you to give me a name.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.859
I don't have a name.
I didn't send anyone.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.813
If you didn't, who who did?

38:29.524 --> 38:35.704
You know... Nothing has to happen
to you that you don't want to.

38:38.038 --> 38:43.433
But you know that I'm not gonna stop...
until I get a name.

38:44.125 --> 38:45.504
Fuck you.

38:53.712 --> 38:58.413
I am sorry, brother, 'cause
I didn't want it to go this way.

39:00.885 --> 39:02.867
Jesus told us
"Blessed be the peacemakers,

39:02.967 --> 39:07.206
for they shall be called
the children of God."

39:09.935 --> 39:13.776
But how far are we
willing to go for peace?

39:15.697 --> 39:18.598
Surely, it is not enough
just to wish for it.

39:20.479 --> 39:22.458
Jesus understood this.

39:23.708 --> 39:30.224
To redeem mankind, he had to
suffer, to withstand torture and

39:30.357 --> 39:33.542
death in order to
wash clean the world.

39:34.210 --> 39:41.118
He teaches us there is no
peace without suffering.

39:43.470 --> 39:45.865
No one knows this
better than a soldier.

39:50.590 --> 39:54.739
This Christmas, I find myself
thinking of the soldiers

39:54.825 --> 39:58.300
overseas who make the
ultimate sacrifice for peace.

39:59.693 --> 40:03.568
As did Our Savior, they put
their lives on the line to

40:03.697 --> 40:05.213
fulfill their promise.

40:06.081 --> 40:10.460
They bear their burden with
courage and faith because they

40:10.562 --> 40:14.423
know that to suffer in war is to
honor Jesus' suffering on the

40:14.545 --> 40:17.730
cross and carry out God's will.

40:19.597 --> 40:26.932
To those who have taken on
this holy cause to protect and

40:27.041 --> 40:29.479
defend this great nation,

40:31.081 --> 40:35.102
to my men who have endured pain
and hardship to achieve peace,

40:35.212 --> 40:38.563
I tell you your suffering
is not in vain.

40:39.757 --> 40:41.238
It is an act of love.

40:41.477 --> 40:43.109
A testament to your faith.

40:43.284 --> 40:47.680
The pain you endure, no
matter how unbearable...

40:50.355 --> 40:52.476
will bring you closer to God.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.403
A.C., what's the report?

41:08.918 --> 41:10.500
He's a tough son of a bitch.

41:11.942 --> 41:13.313
Yeah?
What'd you get from him?

41:13.482 --> 41:17.191
The guy's name is Nasim Marwat.

41:17.756 --> 41:19.480
All right,
nice work, A.C.

41:34.418 --> 41:35.941
- Hello?
- It is Nasim.

41:36.698 --> 41:39.402
- Is everything okay?
- No. I need to see you.

41:39.630 --> 41:42.695
Okay. Stay calm, Mr.
Marwat. Where are you?

41:50.313 --> 41:52.420
Miss Parsons, the
other American from Chris'

41:52.522 --> 41:56.315
mission, the one I told you
about, he is here in New York.

41:56.558 --> 41:57.795
Are you certain
it was the same person?

41:57.904 --> 41:59.785
I saw him.
He was following me.

41:59.905 --> 42:02.313
I wanted to tell you this
before I return to Afghanistan.

42:02.611 --> 42:05.419
Mr. Marwat, you can't go back yet.
I need to get your testimony.

42:05.550 --> 42:06.670
I have already lost my father.

42:06.756 --> 42:08.259
My family cannot
afford to lose me.

42:08.363 --> 42:09.817
I understand your
concern, but I'm asking you to

42:09.904 --> 42:11.709
just give us a little more time.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.879
I got a name.

42:16.961 --> 42:20.010
Don't matter.
Don't need it anymore.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.103
What do you
mean, you don't need it?

42:22.546 --> 42:24.411
I'm looking
at our guy right now.

42:27.030 --> 42:28.144
Trust me...

42:32.598 --> 42:35.147
Hey, Dad, great speech.
That was, that was really cool.

42:35.355 --> 42:38.365
Thank you.
Go round up your brothers.

42:38.540 --> 42:39.371
Yes, sir.

42:40.155 --> 42:42.411
That was very moving, Howard.

42:42.657 --> 42:43.487
Thank you.

42:43.596 --> 42:46.085
What's wrong?
You were inspiring.

42:46.182 --> 42:49.666
It was a beautiful sermon.
Deacon Charles videotaped it.

42:49.762 --> 42:50.942
I'll get you a copy.

43:00.576 --> 43:02.739
Santa wants to know
if you've been nice, Patty.

43:03.611 --> 43:06.949
Because Howard Erickson has
been very, very, very naughty.

43:07.065 --> 43:09.053
You were able to
confirm our witness' story?

43:09.303 --> 43:14.470
Now that...
would be something of an understatement.

43:28.307 --> 43:31.990
High Star was extracting
terror suspects for the CIA.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.741
And I don't have to
tell you there's a whole world

43:34.834 --> 43:39.434
of people who would prefer to,
uh, keep that from going public.

43:40.287 --> 43:41.569
Thank you for your help.

43:41.991 --> 43:43.342
So what are you gonna do?

43:43.961 --> 43:46.673
I mean, you can't share that
with your little, uh, protege.

43:47.689 --> 43:50.076
The girl's in way over her head.

43:52.170 --> 43:54.102
Yeah, she is.

43:54.873 --> 43:56.375
She can't handle that.

43:57.205 --> 44:00.788
So you keep that for yourself and, uh...
get rid of her.

44:03.988 --> 44:06.627
And remember what I taught
you about dead weight.

44:30.303 --> 44:33.434
I tell you, your
suffering is not in vain.

44:35.520 --> 44:39.780
The pain you endure, no
matter how unbearable...

44:42.431 --> 44:44.893
will bring you closer to God.
