in the playground?

She met you there
outside of school.
You never mentioned it.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.937
A lot of students
volunteer there.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.099
Rosie checked it out once or twice.
I don’t remember.

01:04.106 --> 01:07.439
So it wasn’t her thing?

01:07.443 --> 01:08.979

How’s that relevant?

You’re a spokesman
for the Seattle All Stars.

You drive the campaign

- Help us rule you out.

01:29.674 --> 01:34.509
They gave alums

but I never used any of his cars.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.170
What’d you do
after the dance last Friday?
I went home.

Is there anyone
who can confirm that?

01:40.685 --> 01:42.846
[Sighs]

01:42.853 --> 01:47.688
My wife and l were refinishing
the floors and I didn’t want her
inhaling the fumes,

01:47.692 --> 01:49.774
so she spent the weekend
at her sister’s place.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.688
So that’s a no.

01:51.696 --> 01:55.029
What about the flooring company?
They see you around over the weekend?

01:56.284 --> 02:00.778

They canceled Iast minute.
Had to do it myself.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.121
We found the letters
that you wrote her.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.159
Want to take a shot
at that one, Ahmed?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.041
Rosie didn’t like
to raise her hand in class,

02:12.049 --> 02:15.041
so she left me notes
and I wrote her back.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.885
It was an intellectual discourse.
That’s it.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.138
You save any
of her notes?
No, I didn’t.

02:21.142 --> 02:24.851
You wouldn’t want any of those
falling into the wrong hands,
would you?

over 200 students a year.

stay awake in class.
Rosie was different.

She was curious.
She was hungry.
Huh.

I know how this looks, okay?

02:40.244 --> 02:43.577
But I am telling you.
This girl had a gift.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.869

see the world, express herself.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.478

06:38.482 --> 06:42.066
Because the Larsen girl’s
still hurting us,
even with this new ad buy.

not returning my calls.

You are wrong about Gwen.
It’s a simple process
of elimination.

how he lures them in.

Well, you recommended Nathan
to my campaign.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.401
- So what?
- So he could be
your eyes and ears.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.441
- Leak damaging info
to the press.
- Give me a break, Darren.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.532
Come on, I endorsed you.
Why would I want
to hurt your campaign?

39:30.536 --> 39:33.573
Because the more I needed you,
the more concessions I had to make.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.242
Well, when I’m mayor, Ruth,

39:36.250 --> 39:38.491
your husband won’t be getting
any more city contracts.

39:38.502 --> 39:41.118
Without me,
you won’t be the mayor.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.962
You better put a smile on that face
before you hit the door, Ruth.

39:43.966 --> 39:45.797
You’re still supporting me.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.793
You accessed my campaign’s
network without my consent.

39:48.804 --> 39:52.592
I looked at a couple of e-mails.
So what? I even wrote one.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.677
What is the big deal?
Three to 10.

39:54.685 --> 39:58.894
Maybe less, with time off
for good behavior. It’s a felony, Ruth.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.309
So like I said, smile.

40:02.818 --> 40:04.979
At least
I trust my husband.

40:04.987 --> 40:07.148
Can’t say the same
about you two lovebirds.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.816
Maybe he
didn’t tell you.

40:08.824 --> 40:12.487
He had Nathan
check your e-mails
at the same time.

What happened
to Mr. Hard-To-Get?

42:00.936 --> 42:02.676

Do you have that tox
on the Larsen girl?

42:15.409 --> 42:19.618
Yep. Negative for heroin,
Oxy, E, even alcohol.

Just finished it.

It’s very powerful stuff.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.554
Why would a person
use it on a body?

Does the job.

find anything under her nails...
