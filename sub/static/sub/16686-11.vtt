<i>Elizabeth, Effie,</i>

<i>Addie, and Jessie.</i>

<i>He was like, "Uh, actually,</i>
<i>definitely not.</i>

<i>I'm not, like,</i>
<i>even doing this."</i>

02:03.924 --> 02:04.790

02:04.792 --> 02:07.259
<i>"Boo! What the hell?"</i>

02:07.261 --> 02:10.162
<i>Or "heck," actually,</i>

02:10.164 --> 02:11.363

<i>Let's put on a show."</i>

<i>And then they died</i>
<i>in obscurity.</i>

<i>But, um, that's what we think.</i>

06:55.883 --> 06:58.483
<i>That's not what they thought.</i>

06:58.485 --> 06:59.050
<i>And honestly,</i>

07:22.609 --> 07:25.076
- [chuckles]

07:25.078 --> 07:27.078
Well, I'd heard about eagles.
- Right.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.714
- And I--I had people
describe an eagle to me.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.817
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I went into--

07:31.819 --> 07:34.920
I locked myself
in a sweater factory.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.822
And then this was
what I came up with.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.192
- What a vision.
- Since then, I've seen

07:40.194 --> 07:43.195
actual, uh, bald eagles.
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.796

I was dead on.

<i>with one of the top</i>
<i>Shakespearian a--actors,</i>

08:09.790 --> 08:11.690
<i>William Macready.</i>

<i>"Welcome to London!</i>

<i>"Have fun.</i>
<i>Perform--do Shakespeare here.</i>

08:16.196 --> 08:18.129
<i>"You know, we do it</i>

08:18.131 --> 08:20.832
<i>I'm a little more refined</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.168
<i>"Well, my style's</i>

developed a bit of a rivalry.

08:35.849 --> 08:40.752
<i>Some of Macready fans</i>
<i>start hissing at Edwin Forrest.</i>

08:40.754 --> 08:44.890
<i>[hissing]</i>

08:44.892 --> 08:46.758
<i>[sharp hissing]</i>

08:46.760 --> 08:51.129
[hissing continues]

08:51.131 --> 08:52.898
- [chuckles]

08:52.900 --> 08:55.133
<i>- So then</i>
<i>Macready is performing.</i>

08:55.135 --> 08:56.234
<i>He's in the middle</i>
<i>of a performance,</i>

08:56.236 --> 08:58.403
<i>when somebody goes</i>
<i>a little nuts</i>

08:58.405 --> 09:01.172
<i>and throws a dead sheep</i>
<i>onto the stage.</i>

09:01.174 --> 09:03.174
<i>- Inappropriate.</i>
<i>- Inappropriate.</i>

09:03.176 --> 09:06.912
<i>It was the thing that crossed</i>
<i>the line for their rivalry.</i>

09:06.914 --> 09:07.679
So then,

09:07.681 --> 09:09.180
<i>William Macready</i>
<i>goes to New York,</i>

09:09.182 --> 09:10.382
<i>and he's got a ten-show run</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:12.884
<i>over at the Astor Place</i>
<i>Opera House.</i>

09:12.886 --> 09:15.387
<i>He's gonna do "Macbeth,"</i>

09:15.389 --> 09:16.821
the cursed play.

09:16.823 --> 09:17.389
<i>Lo and behold,</i>

09:17.391 --> 09:20.926
<i>Edwin Forrest is also do--</i>
<i>gonna do "Macbeth"</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:21.793
<i>over at the Bowery Theatre,</i>

09:21.795 --> 09:23.995
<i>the theater for his fan base.</i>

09:23.997 --> 09:26.865
And so they're both doing
"Macbeth" in New York.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.367
<i>So William Macready says,</i>
<i>"Okay,</i>

09:29.369 --> 09:31.703
<i>"I'm going to</i>
<i>Astor Place Opera House</i>

09:31.705 --> 09:33.171
<i>"to do my last 'Macbeth.'</i>

09:33.173 --> 09:37.275
<i>And this is gonna be</i>
<i>the most 'Macbest' ever seen."</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:39.811
both: [laughing]

09:41.948 --> 09:44.950
<i>- Okay, so William Macready</i>
<i>is up on stage.</i>

09:44.952 --> 09:48.753
<i>And as soon as he starts in</i>
<i>with his first line,</i>

09:48.755 --> 09:51.990
<i>"Lady Macbeth, what's going on?</i>
<i>What's for dinner tonight?"</i>

09:51.992 --> 09:54.359
<i>"We love Forrest!</i>
<i>We love Forrest!"</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:56.728
<i>And then, you know,</i>
<i>Lady Macbeth comes out,</i>

09:56.730 --> 09:58.129
<i>and they're like,</i>
<i>"Who's this bitch?"</i>

09:58.131 --> 10:00.065
<i>They're throwing</i>
<i>all kinds of [bleep] at him.</i>

10:00.067 --> 10:02.901
<i>Pennies, [bleep] apples,</i>
<i>and potatoes.</i>

10:02.903 --> 10:05.804
<i>Popcorn, fruit, and apples.</i>

10:05.806 --> 10:10.241
<i>They're throwing rotten eggs</i>
<i>and churros.</i>

10:10.243 --> 10:11.309
- [giggles]

10:11.311 --> 10:13.211
<i>- Macready is like, "I'm done.</i>

10:13.213 --> 10:14.813
<i>"I'm breaking my contract.</i>

10:14.815 --> 10:17.248
<i>I'm heading back to London."</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:20.885
The, um, wealthy elite
of New York heard about this,

10:20.887 --> 10:24.289
<i>and they all</i>
<i>cosigned a letter saying,</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:28.093
<i>"Please don't let these</i>
<i>rabble-rousers scare you away.</i>

10:28.095 --> 10:29.894
<i>"Do 'Macbeth' one more time.</i>

10:29.896 --> 10:31.930
<i>Nail it."</i>

10:31.932 --> 10:33.765
So Macready reads this letter,

10:33.767 --> 10:36.034
<i>and he says,</i>
<i>"You know what? I'll stay.</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:40.805
<i>I'll stay and do 'Macbeth'</i>
<i>one more goddamn time."</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:43.441
<i>It was the makings</i>
<i>of a major clash</i>

10:43.443 --> 10:46.811
<i>between the rich and the poor.</i>

10:46.813 --> 10:47.512
The day of the show,

10:47.514 --> 10:51.249
<i>Macready is ready</i>
<i>to hit the stage.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:54.185
<i>Meanwhile, outside...</i>

10:54.187 --> 10:55.987
- You gonna burp?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.422
- [exhales]

10:57.424 --> 10:58.990
No.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.358
It was a little gas.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.061
<i>Uh...meanwhile, outside,</i>

11:03.063 --> 11:04.195
<i>the Bowery Boys show up.</i>

11:04.197 --> 11:07.098
<i>And the Astor Place people</i>
<i>at the door are like,</i>

11:07.100 --> 11:10.502
<i>"There's a dress code.</i>
<i>You can't come in here."</i>

11:10.504 --> 11:12.971
<i>So they're like,</i>
<i>"Oh, [bleep]."</i>

11:12.973 --> 11:15.540
<i>And that really</i>
<i>pissed off the mob.</i>

11:15.542 --> 11:16.808
<i>So they hung out outside.</i>

11:16.810 --> 11:20.211
<i>People are just--a real crowd</i>
<i>is gathering out there.</i>

11:20.213 --> 11:22.414
<i>Meanwhile, all the</i>
<i>fancy people are inside.</i>

11:22.416 --> 11:24.916
<i>Curtain comes up,</i>
<i>and there's the witches.</i>

11:24.918 --> 11:26.985
<i>"A bubble, toil, and trouble.</i>

11:26.987 --> 11:30.955
<i>"Witches burn, and cauldron--</i>
<i>[bleep]--to bubble--"</i>

11:30.957 --> 11:33.358
I can't [bleep]--[laughs]

11:33.360 --> 11:36.494
[bleep]. I [bleep] it up.
Wait, wait, wait.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.129
No, no.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.999
<i>"Bubble, bubble,</i>
<i>toil, and trouble.</i>

11:41.001 --> 11:44.836
<i>"Cauldron burns,</i>
<i>and here's Macbeth.</i>

11:44.838 --> 11:46.171
<i>Here he comes."</i>

11:46.173 --> 11:48.106
<i>Macready comes in,</i>
<i>and he's Macbeth,</i>

11:48.108 --> 11:51.576
<i>and he's like, "Here I am."</i>

11:51.578 --> 11:53.912
<i>And then everybody</i>
<i>starts hissing at him.</i>

11:53.914 --> 11:54.512
<i>[hissing]</i>

11:54.514 --> 11:56.948
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, [bleep], here we go."</i>

11:56.950 --> 12:00.185
So outside,
this mob of 10,000 people,

12:00.187 --> 12:04.055
<i>they start picking up rocks</i>
<i>and--and cobblestones</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:06.324
<i>and start throwing 'em</i>
<i>at the cops.</i>

12:06.326 --> 12:08.359
<i>And then a militia guy</i>
<i>is saying,</i>

12:08.361 --> 12:12.130
<i>"Start firing into the crowd!</i>
<i>Fire, fire, fire!"</i>

12:12.132 --> 12:17.001
<i>And so they start firing</i>
<i>their muskets into the crowd.</i>

12:17.003 --> 12:18.870
<i>And then all hell breaks loose.</i>

12:18.872 --> 12:21.306
It's just a goddamn massacre
out there.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.207
<i>People are dying.</i>

12:22.209 --> 12:25.009
<i>They're just like,</i>
<i>"Burn this place down."</i>

12:25.011 --> 12:26.177
<i>They keep on battling,</i>

12:26.179 --> 12:30.115
<i>trying to find their way</i>
<i>into the opera house.</i>

12:30.117 --> 12:30.882
And it's ridiculous

12:30.884 --> 12:32.550
'cause the play is over
at this point.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.453
<i>The mob is infiltrating</i>
<i>the opera house.</i>

12:35.455 --> 12:38.857
<i>And so Macready</i>
<i>decides to put on a disguise.</i>

12:38.859 --> 12:42.594
<i>And he's just like,</i>
<i>"I'm a New York hot dog man.</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:44.028
<i>"No big deal.</i>

12:44.030 --> 12:45.964
<i>Hot dog!</i>
<i>Get your hot dog!"</i>

12:45.966 --> 12:47.932
<i>And he actually escapes.</i>

12:47.934 --> 12:51.436
<i>And when the dust settles,</i>
<i>30 people are dead,</i>

12:51.438 --> 12:52.237
<i>100 people are injured,</i>

12:52.239 --> 12:54.005
<i>and it's the first time</i>
<i>that a militia</i>

12:54.007 --> 12:58.243
<i>has ever fired</i>
<i>on a mob of American citizens.</i>

12:58.245 --> 13:02.113
<i>Edwin Forrest, he finds out</i>
<i>about the whole riot,</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:03.148
<i>and he can't believe it.</i>

13:03.150 --> 13:09.587
<i>In 1871, Edwin Forrest played</i>
<i>his last Shakespearian role</i>

13:09.589 --> 13:10.522
<i>of King Lear.</i>

13:10.524 --> 13:14.125
<i>"Hey.</i>
<i>Here I am playing King Lear.</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:16.461
<i>"Can you believe it?</i>

13:16.463 --> 13:20.064
<i>We're here. We're Lear.</i>
<i>Get used to it."</i>

13:20.066 --> 13:22.667
both: [laughing]

13:26.672 --> 13:27.505
- This is tequila, right?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.440
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.075
- To Steve Dahl.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.511
Teenagers everywhere.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.746
- Mm-hmm.

13:34.748 --> 13:38.650
Thanks. Thanks, Steve.
- Down the hatch, buddy.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.517
- Mmm.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.185
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.253
- Once every 35 years...

13:42.255 --> 13:45.023
- Is that right?
- I drink tequila.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.424
- You're like a--a cicada.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.494
- Keep those companies,
you know, rolling and doling.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.728
- Yeah.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.031
- [chuckles]

13:54.300 --> 13:55.300
Hello, I'm Bob Odenkirk,

13:55.302 --> 13:59.637
and today we're gonna
talk about Disco Demolition.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.772
- Cheers.

14:00.774 --> 14:01.406
- Cheers.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.241
- Thanks, Bob.
You okay?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.610
- My first [bleep] sip.
[laughter]

14:05.612 --> 14:08.046
<i>[disco music plays]</i>
<i>Well, I guess our story</i>

14:08.048 --> 14:10.582
<i>really begins in 1977</i>

14:10.584 --> 14:14.319
<i>with the massive success</i>
<i>of [bleep] disco,</i>

14:14.321 --> 14:17.388
which is a terrible
form of music.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.623
both: [snickering]

14:18.625 --> 14:22.660
- Anyway, 1977,
"Saturday Night Fever."

14:22.662 --> 14:23.595
<i>Very popular movie.</i>

14:23.597 --> 14:24.796
<i>Blah, blah, blah.</i>
<i>Everyone loved it.</i>

14:24.798 --> 14:29.267
<i>"At WDAI in Chicago,</i>
<i>we're Disco DAI.</i>

14:29.269 --> 14:32.136
<i>All disco,</i>
<i>all day and all night."</i>

14:32.138 --> 14:35.473
<i>Okay, so Steve Dahl is a DJ,</i>

14:35.475 --> 14:37.609
<i>24 years old, at The Loop,</i>

14:37.611 --> 14:39.344
<i>WLUP 97.9.</i>

14:39.346 --> 14:41.112
<i>And it's</i>
<i>a rock 'n' roll station.</i>

14:41.114 --> 14:42.046
<i>Steve Dahl, uh, says,</i>

14:42.048 --> 14:45.216
<i>"[bleep] you, I'm not</i>
<i>gonna play disco music."</i>

14:45.218 --> 14:46.751
And Steve
is having a good time,

14:46.753 --> 14:48.286
and he's blowing up
disco records.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.221
<i>So on the radio, he'd go,</i>
<i>"I got a disco--</i>

14:50.223 --> 14:51.789
<i>"lookit,</i>
<i>KISS made a disco record.</i>

14:51.791 --> 14:52.824
<i>I'm gonna blow it up."</i>

14:52.826 --> 14:54.459
<i>Then he'd play it,</i>
<i>and then scratch the...</i>

14:54.461 --> 14:57.061
<i>[imitates record scratch]</i>
<i>The needle on the record,</i>

14:57.063 --> 14:58.463
<i>and then press</i>
<i>a cart tape and...</i>

14:58.465 --> 15:00.398
<i>[imitates explosion]</i>
<i>Explosion sound.</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:02.333
<i>And then laugh, and then</i>
<i>do other dumb [bleep].</i>

15:02.335 --> 15:05.303
<i>- Like my favorite, Imus.</i>

15:05.305 --> 15:08.172
- [laughs]

15:08.174 --> 15:09.240
- What?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.441
- Not like Imus.

15:10.443 --> 15:10.875
- Okay.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.811
<i>- Very much like Stern,</i>
<i>I mean, truly,</i>

15:13.813 --> 15:16.514
<i>but actually, before Stern.</i>

15:16.516 --> 15:17.682
So it's 1979.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.652
<i>Jeff Schwartz</i>
<i>is the promotions kid.</i>

15:20.654 --> 15:23.388
<i>And he goes to--sorry.</i>

15:23.722 --> 15:25.623
He goes to Mike Veeck
at the White Sox,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.759
<i>and he goes,</i>
<i>"Let's do a Disco Demolition</i>

15:27.761 --> 15:31.129
<i>at White Sox Comiskey Park</i>
<i>for your team night."</i>

15:31.131 --> 15:34.666
<i>Mike Veeck is like,</i>
<i>"Great! I love Steve Dahl."</i>

15:34.668 --> 15:37.201
<i>They hire a guy to, uh,</i>

15:37.203 --> 15:39.837
put the explosives in.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.839
<i>"We need you</i>
<i>to blow up records."</i>

15:41.841 --> 15:44.142
<i>"How many records?"</i>

15:44.144 --> 15:46.244
<i>"Uh, well, I don't know.</i>
<i>2,000?"</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:48.446
<i>"Okay, hold on a second.</i>
<i>Slow down.</i>

15:48.448 --> 15:51.416
<i>I need some goddamn</i>
<i>real explosives here."</i>

15:51.418 --> 15:53.351
<i>"All right, well,</i>
<i>whatever you need.</i>

15:53.353 --> 15:54.385
<i>You're the pro."</i>

15:54.387 --> 15:55.486
<i>"Hell yes, I am.</i>

15:55.488 --> 15:59.757
<i>"Just got back from the 'Nam</i>
<i>about five years ago.</i>

15:59.759 --> 16:01.359
<i>"Anyhow...</i>
<i>[clears throat]</i>

16:01.361 --> 16:04.395
<i>I will put your explosives</i>
<i>together for you."</i>

16:04.397 --> 16:07.598
So Steve's on the radio
for weeks going,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
<i>"I got Disco Demolition</i>
<i>coming up.</i>

16:09.602 --> 16:13.471
<i>"Come to Comiskey Park</i>
<i>and bring a disco album.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:16.774
<i>"They'll take your album;</i>
<i>they'll put it in a bin.</i>

16:16.776 --> 16:19.210
<i>"You'll pay 98¢ for a ticket.</i>

16:19.212 --> 16:20.611
<i>"And then in between games,</i>

16:20.613 --> 16:22.647
<i>"I'm gonna blow up</i>
<i>all those albums.</i>

16:22.649 --> 16:25.316
<i>We're gonna destroy disco.</i>
<i>Ha-ha-ha."</i>

16:25.318 --> 16:29.320
So the night of the event comes.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.389
July 12, 1979.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.559
<i>Steve's, like, watching.</i>
<i>"Holy [bleep]."</i>

16:34.561 --> 16:37.328
<i>Kids are showing up--</i>
<i>like, showing up in droves.</i>

16:37.330 --> 16:38.229
<i>Showing up, showing up.</i>

16:38.231 --> 16:41.399
<i>15,000. 20,000. 30,000.</i>

16:41.401 --> 16:43.334
<i>[bleep] "A."</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.470
The first game is nuts.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.471
<i>Kids in the stands</i>
<i>have records.</i>

16:46.473 --> 16:48.206
<i>They're throwing them.</i>

16:48.208 --> 16:51.209
<i>Record albums come flying</i>
<i>out of the stands.</i>

16:51.211 --> 16:51.642
<i>Shoop!</i>

16:51.644 --> 16:52.410
Cutting into the grass.

16:52.412 --> 16:55.380
<i>Harry Caray's kind of</i>
<i>liking it, you can tell.</i>

16:55.382 --> 16:59.250
<i>"Hey! All right,</i>
<i>everybody, calm down!"</i>

16:59.252 --> 17:02.353
<i>And Jimmy Piersall</i>
<i>is taking it way too seriously.</i>

17:02.355 --> 17:04.856
<i>"These kids...</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:07.225
<i>This is a disgrace."</i>

17:07.227 --> 17:08.860
Anyhow...
- [hiccups]

17:08.862 --> 17:12.230
- Game ends. First game ends.
Sox lose.

17:12.232 --> 17:12.897
<i>That's not helpful.</i>

17:12.899 --> 17:17.769
<i>And Steve--they drive out</i>
<i>to, like, center field.</i>
