Don't you have an eating disorder

Yeah, anyway, uh, we could see

Oh, actually, that's no good. I'm
meeting my friend Denise for a drink.

- Thank you.
- You had a girlfriend before Mom?

Try two.

00:31.787 --> 00:33.539
Trust me. I had plenty
of fun in my time.

And then I met your mom.

So I guess she travels around selling

Ay, you're still sad

That part was mine.
I was born to play Tevye.

- A little better.

Maybe.

20:38.284 --> 20:39.953
Get some rest.

20:40.036 --> 20:42.414
Since we're confessing things,

20:42.497 --> 20:44.457
you know
that scratch on your car?

20:44.541 --> 20:46.334
The one that can't
be buffed out? Yeah?

20:46.418 --> 20:49.379
- You should probably know
how it happened.
- I know how it happened.

20:50.672 --> 20:52.549
Raccoon did it.

20:54.342 --> 20:56.344
Good night, Jay.
Good night, kid.

20:59.514 --> 21:02.684
Best thing I ever did was quit a
miserable job and start my own business.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.978
- Thanks, Dad.
- No, it's not gonna be easy.

21:05.061 --> 21:08.481
That's why Gloria and I wanna give you
a little something to help you through it.

21:08.565 --> 21:11.818
- No, Dad, I can't.
- No. I want to, Mitch.

21:11.901 --> 21:15.321
Okay, but as soon as I'm
back on my feet, I really want to...

21:15.405 --> 21:18.533
Oh. Oh, Dad. No. You...

21:18.616 --> 21:21.494
You tried to give me this 20 years ago
when my pet snake died.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.329
I did?
Yes.

21:23.455 --> 21:26.166
Zsa Zsa Gaboa?
Oh, that's adorable.

21:26.249 --> 21:28.710
And you really didn't know
that he was gay?

21:28.793 --> 21:30.795
I must've, right?

21:36.759 --> 21:37.760
