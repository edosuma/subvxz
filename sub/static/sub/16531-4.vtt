00:01.902 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.311
Previously on Empire...
All anybody can talk about

00:10.344 --> 00:13.247
is this rare talent.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.516
You got shot.
Your PTSD is no less

00:15.549 --> 00:17.551
significant than mine.
You need treatment, man.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.652
The Jamal Lyon
that you know

00:18.686 --> 00:19.620
went missing when you shot him.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.256
Oh, dude... oh...
I did not mean to hurt you.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.857
(crying):
Andre messed up.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.393
Andre did mess up.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.527
COOKIE:
I didn't know Gram

00:26.560 --> 00:28.496
was performing
with Tiana tonight.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.530
LUCIOUS:
Why don't you spit

00:29.563 --> 00:31.031
some napalm on
the diss track

00:31.065 --> 00:33.767
and bury him and
everything he cares about.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.169
Cookie, you
should come down

00:35.203 --> 00:36.237
to the center sometime.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.271
I'm retaking control
of Empire Music...

00:37.305 --> 00:38.539
(chuckles)

00:38.572 --> 00:40.174
...because,
at the end of the day,

00:40.208 --> 00:41.442
it's all business.

00:47.281 --> 00:51.919
* Ooh

00:51.952 --> 00:57.191
* Ah

00:57.225 --> 01:00.761
* Oh, oh, oh

01:00.794 --> 01:04.064
* Oh, oh, oh...

01:04.098 --> 01:05.065
MAN:
That's all you got?

01:05.099 --> 01:07.101
Oh, man, come on.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.407
* Uh...

01:16.277 --> 01:18.446
Why aren't we doing this
at Empire?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.782
Small concession.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.719
Nessa's deal is a standard
new artist contract.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.954
And if it makes
Shine feel

01:26.987 --> 01:28.956
like a big shot
to have us show up

01:28.989 --> 01:32.092
at his rinky-dink-ass,
little joint,

01:32.126 --> 01:34.728
to dot the Ts and cross
the Is, so be it.

01:34.762 --> 01:39.667
* Oh, oh, oh

01:39.700 --> 01:44.004
* Oh, yeah
* Oh, oh, oh *

01:44.037 --> 01:45.506
Is that her?

01:45.539 --> 01:46.774
Oh, that's right.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.509
You weren't at the
Empire XStream event

01:48.542 --> 01:49.910
when she busted out.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.913
What you're hearing right
now is an experience

01:52.946 --> 01:55.316
only a black woman
can give you.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.751
When they talk
about soul music...

01:57.785 --> 01:59.019
* I heard him say...

01:59.052 --> 02:01.155
...this is what
they're talking about.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.857
That's why we need to lock
her down real quick.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.259
(siren beeps)

02:05.293 --> 02:09.096
* But he won't live to see
another day... *

02:09.129 --> 02:11.499
Careful, son.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.167
You're in
the system now.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.335
* I miss him

02:14.368 --> 02:16.770
* Another body, another victim

02:16.804 --> 02:18.772
* All because
of this crooked system *

02:18.806 --> 02:20.941
* They took him,
they cooked him, listen *

02:20.974 --> 02:24.612
* Bruised and abused
but we refuse to lose again *

02:24.645 --> 02:25.713
* Whoa, oh, oh *

02:25.746 --> 02:28.516
* Open eyes, we will rise

02:28.549 --> 02:29.650
* We gon' fight...

02:29.683 --> 02:30.951
SHINE:
Lucious.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.386
* We won't die, we're alive

02:32.420 --> 02:34.188
* Because we're

02:34.222 --> 02:36.190
* Woke... *
Something for
your new wife.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.359
* Ain't going nowhere,
we're standing here *

02:38.392 --> 02:39.660
* Woke... *

02:39.693 --> 02:41.295
LUCIOUS:
Let's just close
this thing, Shine.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.396
* No more crying

02:42.430 --> 02:44.198
* No more blood and tears

02:44.232 --> 02:45.666
* Woke, woke *

02:45.699 --> 02:46.867
* We're built on strength

02:46.900 --> 02:48.702
* We've buried all our fears

02:48.736 --> 02:51.239
* We all see what's going on

02:51.272 --> 02:54.174
* No need to ring the alarm
cause we're *

02:54.208 --> 02:55.243
* Woke...

02:55.276 --> 02:56.244
Andre.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.378
* We gon' fight

02:57.411 --> 02:58.646
* Everything gon' be all right

02:58.679 --> 02:59.647
Dre.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.848
* We're aware...

03:00.881 --> 03:02.550
Yeah, I'm sorry.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.151
Uh, so, you can
have somebody

03:04.184 --> 03:05.353
look this over
if you want,

03:05.386 --> 03:06.720
but I can assure you
it's legitimate.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.988
Shine, just sign
the thing.

03:08.021 --> 03:08.956
Yeah.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.025
I'm not gonna do that.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.894
I mean, what kind
of businessman

03:13.927 --> 03:16.730
would I be without
entertaining other offers?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.932
* That are losing
all their sons *

03:18.966 --> 03:20.568
* What about all the daughters

03:20.601 --> 03:21.835
* That are losing...

03:21.869 --> 03:23.203
SHINE:
All your friends
are here.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.905
We got Frank Sutton,

03:24.938 --> 03:26.173
Warner/Chappell,

03:26.206 --> 03:27.708
Trey Rhodes,
Cecil Bivens,

03:27.741 --> 03:29.042
Island Def Jam.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.912
Over there is, uh,
Universal Music Group.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.281
And Empire.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.683
Word on the street is,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.785
Tommy Davoni
wants to get in, too.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.789
Looks like we
got ourselves

03:41.822 --> 03:44.758
an old school bidding
war here, gentlemen.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.927
Have you all present to me
by Friday.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.230
* Won't you stop
killing my people... *

03:50.264 --> 03:53.233
Let's make
it... 11:17.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.802
Thanks for coming.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.773
*

04:04.645 --> 04:07.247
What kind of bonehead
lets a voice like that

04:07.281 --> 04:08.248
slip through the cracks?

04:08.282 --> 04:09.417
That deal should
have been closed

04:09.450 --> 04:10.584
three damn weeks ago.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.486
First of all,
nobody calls me out my name.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.288
Secondly, how
am I supposed

04:14.322 --> 04:15.923
to finalize an
artist contract?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.792
Unless what you're telling me is
that I now have that authority

04:18.826 --> 04:20.728
because there is no head
of A&R to oversee the deal.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.796
She's right.
She's right.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.264
And, Cookie, please,
remember that I put my name

04:24.298 --> 04:25.265
in the hat for that.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.567
For what? A promotion?!

04:26.600 --> 04:27.668
Yeah.
I'm this close

04:27.701 --> 04:28.736
to firing your ass!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.471
Lucious! All right, okay.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.272
Look...

04:32.306 --> 04:33.841
we hired Xavier Rosen.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.075
Who?!
I'm sorry.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.076
He starts tomorrow.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.311
You mean the Jewish dude

04:37.345 --> 04:38.812
pretending he's black?!

04:38.846 --> 04:40.180
Look, he is an encyclopedia

04:40.213 --> 04:41.649
when it comes
to hip-hop and R&B.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.651
And he has the
digital marketplace

04:43.684 --> 04:44.685
on lockdown, Lucious.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.253
That should make you happy.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.655
Empire XStream is your baby.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.458
No, what makes me happy
is you two no longer have

04:50.491 --> 04:52.826
any excuse for this lack
of accountability.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.662
I told y'all there
was money on the table

04:54.695 --> 04:56.864
to be made with this
Gram and Hakeem beef.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.432
Tiana is writing
her clapback song

04:58.466 --> 04:59.667
right now.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.168
If I can get her
to sing the song.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.703
If?
After the mess

05:02.736 --> 05:05.939
you made by using her vocals
on Hakeem's diss track?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.808
You need to
stop dipping

05:07.841 --> 05:09.276
and dapping on my side
of the business.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.344
Okay, well,
get me that song,

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
so I can promote it on my side

05:11.712 --> 05:12.680
of the business.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.348
Or this "game on" of yours

05:14.382 --> 05:15.349
is gonna be "game over."

05:15.383 --> 05:16.984
All right. Whatever.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.318
The hell is wrong with you
right now?

05:18.352 --> 05:19.520
What are you talking about?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.654
No, I get it.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.055
Angelo ain't
called you, has he?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.124
I gave up an artist
for nothing.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.326
Get me that damn song!

05:39.440 --> 05:41.074
COOKIE:
I need Tiana

05:41.108 --> 05:43.811
in the studio working
on that song right away

05:43.844 --> 05:45.546
without her
damn boyfriend.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.880
That boy is a problem.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.382
Uh, you know what?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.917
I want to be
in that session.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.085
Why don't you reschedule
my mani-pedi for tomorrow?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.587
Also, I need
to see Ashunta.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.055
I need to see her

05:55.088 --> 05:56.424
before I go to my
marketing meeting.
Okay.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.491
Um, and has anyone heard...

05:57.525 --> 05:58.692
No, he still
ain't called yet.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.727
BOY:
Miss Cookie.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.595
Yeah, that's me.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.263
(triangle dinging)

06:06.734 --> 06:08.669
What's this?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.903
* Frère Jacques *

06:09.937 --> 06:12.606
* Frère Jacques *
Oh.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.775
* Dormez-vous?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.376
* Dormez-vous?

06:16.410 --> 06:19.680
* Sonnez les matines

06:19.713 --> 06:22.382
* Sonnez
les matines *

06:22.416 --> 06:24.585
* Ding, ding, dong

06:24.618 --> 06:26.787
* Ding, ding,
dong. *

06:26.820 --> 06:29.256
(chuckles)
Oh, that was
beautiful, babies.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.391
Thank you so much.
Say thank you.
Thank you.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.526
Say bye.
Bye, Miss Cookie.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.828
Say bye-bye.
COOKIE:
Aw. Bye-bye.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.097
You lied to me.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.566
I told her, if you fired her,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.600
she could come work for me.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.801
Doing what?

06:40.834 --> 06:41.935
Teaching those beautiful babies

06:41.969 --> 06:44.104
how to scam people?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.406
(laughing):
Oh, come on now.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.908
So, what do you want?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.710
Well, uh,
one of my favorite singers,

06:49.743 --> 06:52.045
Gia Copeland,
is performing...
Oh, you want
me to sign her?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.213
'Cause last I remember,
you didn't want

06:53.246 --> 06:54.948
the little boy, Zeah,
to work with us.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.283
Okay, easy, easy.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.118
I just want to take you
to see some good music.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.620
Gia's performing at The Cooper

06:59.653 --> 07:01.955
and I was wondering if
you could, uh, accompany me.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.123
A date?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.458
Mm-hmm.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.493
A date.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.727
(chuckles)

07:06.760 --> 07:09.563
Well, I am a pretty tough

07:09.597 --> 07:10.564
critic when it
comes to music, so...

07:10.598 --> 07:11.599
Are you?

07:11.632 --> 07:12.600
Are you sure you want that

07:12.633 --> 07:13.601
to be our first date?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.768
Hey, well...

07:14.802 --> 07:16.904
I'm cool if you're cool.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.672
Are you cool?

07:18.706 --> 07:20.641
(sighs)

07:20.674 --> 07:22.476
Okay.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.311
Okay.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.646
I'll get at you.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.314
All right.
(chuckling)

07:27.347 --> 07:28.482
PORSHA:
Oh, suki suki.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.950
He's taking you to that
new club called The Cooper

07:29.983 --> 07:31.485
out there in
Washington Heights.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.520
I heard that
place stay lit.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.922
You gonna have
a good time.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.123
Well, he's a gentleman,
so he probably picked that place

07:36.156 --> 07:37.124
so I could feel comfortable.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.092
I mean, he ain't Lucious,

07:39.126 --> 07:40.961
but I bet he know
how to turn up.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.997
He reminds me of this guy
my daddy wanted me to marry.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.299
BOY: You actually might need
to know how to count

07:46.333 --> 07:48.502
in the future, okay?

07:48.536 --> 07:49.803
You got to trust me,
all right?

07:49.837 --> 07:50.804
Okay.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.540
(smooches)
Oh!

07:52.573 --> 07:53.874
COOKIE: Oh, my God,
there's my dad.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.176
Okay.
(exhales)

07:56.209 --> 07:59.547
I don't know why,
but your dad always scared me.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.881
COOKIE:
He can be scary sometimes.

08:00.914 --> 08:01.882
BOY:
Yeah.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.351
COOKIE:
You'll be fine.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.288
Thanks, Barry.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.124
Hey, how you doing,
Mr. Hardaway?
Hi, Daddy.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.293
See you later.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.628
(chuckles)

08:14.662 --> 08:16.997
* Come inna de dance
with a spliff of sensi *

08:17.030 --> 08:20.200
* Down with the sound
called BDP *

08:20.233 --> 08:21.935
* If you want
to join the crew. *

08:25.706 --> 08:28.576
I defrosted the chicken.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.244
I can put some rice on with it.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.847
Candace is on one
of her diets, so...

08:33.881 --> 08:35.816
you should have some
leftovers for lunch.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.985
The school called.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.052
You skipped second
and third period

08:39.086 --> 08:40.387
three days this week.
I better not hear

08:40.420 --> 08:41.855
you running around
with that drug dealer.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.891
Look, I'm not doing
nothing wrong, Daddy.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.058
I'm not messing around
with drugs.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.226
I'm keeping my grades up.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.596
Look... it's just
about the music.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.097
Loretha, we have plans.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.399
Howard. Maybe
medical school.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.068
Candace is not as smart
as she thinks she is.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.737
And Carol...
baby, Carol's gonna

08:56.770 --> 08:58.105
always gonna have
to walk uphill.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.540
You special, Loretha.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.776
You're the one.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.844
You put too much on me, Dad.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.579
I put everything on you.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.914
And I swear before God,

09:06.947 --> 09:08.415
I'm not gonna let no
Lucifer Lyons,

09:08.448 --> 09:10.250
or whatever the hell
his name is, get in the way.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.122
Barry's a good boy, Loretha.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.424
The kind that's gonna

09:17.457 --> 09:18.692
lift you up
and not drag you down.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.728
You understand me?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.896
(engine starts)

09:30.237 --> 09:31.839
(chuckles)

09:32.773 --> 09:34.742
Hey, Lucious.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.776
What are you doing

09:35.809 --> 09:37.444
slithering around here?

09:37.477 --> 09:38.812
Ear hustling?

09:38.846 --> 09:40.914
I work here, remember?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.051
I'm just worried about you,
you know.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.986
Yeah. I want
what's best for you.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.387
Oh, you do?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.289
Well, then why
are you giving Angelo

09:49.322 --> 09:50.824
such a hard way to go, huh?

09:50.858 --> 09:53.093
'Cause he don't know you
like I do.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.294
He don't know
where you come from.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.729
He don't know
what your drive is.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.331
Well, what he is is a good man,
Lucious.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.568
A man who will lift his
woman up, instead of drag her

10:01.601 --> 10:03.804
through every kind of hell.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.905
Look, it's true.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
I don't know him.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.908
All I know is he's got a string

10:07.941 --> 10:09.409
of socialites that he dates.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.610
And I wonder why

10:10.644 --> 10:11.812
he's dating you.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.980
(sighs)
Did he tell
you that he

10:13.013 --> 10:15.182
put in a bid
to run for mayor?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.984
Do you think
he's gonna do that

10:17.017 --> 10:19.853
with a convicted felon
on his arm?

10:36.203 --> 10:38.005
Let me holler
at her, Dad.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.206
Me and Nessa,
we're tight.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.108
Plus, I'm good
with Shine.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.843
I can get her on Empire.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.345
You think so, huh?

10:45.378 --> 10:48.181
You always on me
about "be a man."

10:48.215 --> 10:49.482
I'm telling you, I got this.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.219
It's too late.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.486
I already told Dre
to handle it.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.356
Well, how about
me and Hakeem, we...

10:56.389 --> 10:58.225
do it together?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.131
Something like this got
to be done right.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.200
I mean, Shine is gonna take
every advantage that he can.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.071
All right, what's the offer?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.505
A million on signing.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.308
Another $500,000
after her first album,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.845
and a $500,000 bonus
if she hits platinum

11:17.878 --> 11:19.412
or a billion streams.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.547
Whichever comes first.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.082
Make it a million-five
and I'll sign it.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.818
That's a $2h million deal.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.253
This is how it's done.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.723
We want to tuck in Shine
and get rid of the competition.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.925
Me and Dre won't let you down.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.295
Give me a second with Pop, okay?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.699
Appreciate it.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.671
Were you aware that
Jamal went to see

11:44.704 --> 11:46.073
Freda Gatz in lockup?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.012
I thought you should know
he's planning on

11:52.045 --> 11:54.647
going back again today.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.852
(sighs)

11:58.886 --> 12:00.453
Thanks, son.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.290
Yeah.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.262
It's good to have you back.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.301
You and me are about to become
a powerful team again.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.781
Thank you
for coming.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.449
I'm glad you called.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.084
I just hope that
she'll even talk to me

12:31.118 --> 12:33.954
I... I was too hard
on her last time.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.322
That's not gonna
happen this time.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.057
You've done the work, and
you're ready to face her.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.626
You know what,
I... I...

12:39.659 --> 12:41.962
Um...
Follow...
Follow my breathing.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.597
(steadies breathing)

12:51.939 --> 12:53.640
(buzzer blares)
Good.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.408
Now, she might be
angry when she sees you,

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
so I want you to try to...
GUARD: Jamal Lyon!

12:59.479 --> 13:00.914
I'm gonna leave you to this.
Okay.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.015
Thanks, Philip.
You got this.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.517
Yeah.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.370
Who did that to you?

13:24.872 --> 13:27.841
Let's just say
you got some really,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.342
really big fans in here.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.112
All right, well,
you can't stay here.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.014
State of New York got
something different

13:34.047 --> 13:35.182
to say about that.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.616
No, no, what did
your lawyer say?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.952
The lawyer Lucious sent?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.188
He don't care
about me, man.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.056
Lucious sent that man
in here to make sure

13:43.090 --> 13:45.292
I kept my mouth shut
about certain things.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.027
But I'm not
no snitch, so...

13:47.060 --> 13:48.695
I'm gonna fix this.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.398
I am.
(scoffs)

13:52.900 --> 13:54.634
It's all good.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.769
I belong here
for what I did to you.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.242
And I'm sorry
about that.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.711
I'm really sorry
about that, Mal.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.379
I know, I know.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.149
It's cool.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.719
You get beat up
on the head a little bit,

14:12.752 --> 14:16.056
they put you in segregation
for a few days.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.725
So I'm good.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.527
I'll be safe in there.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.533
HAKEEM: Welcome to my
Empire XStream channel.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.902
Hakeem lives the dream 24/7!

14:28.936 --> 14:32.172
Listen, y'all, we comin' to
y'all live right now in effect,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.407
with Empire's beautiful
new star.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.344
Her name is Nessa,
and I invited her

14:37.377 --> 14:39.246
and her ugly-ass manager Shine
to my crib

14:39.279 --> 14:41.881
to come here
and celebrate with us

14:41.915 --> 14:44.751
in honor of her signing
with Empire-- ain't that right?

14:44.784 --> 14:46.053
Bring it!

14:46.086 --> 14:48.655
I picked this little fella
out the field myself.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.758
HAKEEM:
That's how we roll at Empire.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.726
Come here, Nessa.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.730
(beats kick in)

14:57.764 --> 14:59.266
Now, once we get
the business out the way,

14:59.299 --> 15:01.101
we can get
some work done.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.235
Hit them songs
I was talking about.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.470
Get you some hits, girl.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.106
(grunts) Ain't gonna be
no signing to Empire

15:06.139 --> 15:07.907
unless Daddy get
them numbers right.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.142
Whatever price you need.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.610
You not gonna beat
this offer.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.245
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell me the offer.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.547
If it's good enough,
I'll sign it right now.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.950
I don't have any
contracts on me.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.520
Okay, just put it
on that napkin.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.424
It'll be binding until
we get the long forms done.

15:24.457 --> 15:28.928
But I'll sign it
if it's dope.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.797
Hey, you got a pen?

15:30.830 --> 15:32.499
I got one.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.701
Okay.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.852
Oh.
(whistles)

15:54.121 --> 15:56.156
That's a nice offer,
right?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.658
That's a real nice offer.
Yeah.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.495
Yo, y'all see that?
Yo, man!

16:02.529 --> 16:04.264
That's how Empire comin'.
Stop showin' everybody, man!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.333
All you other labels out there,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.935
don't even come below 2.5.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.170
Shine's waiting, baby.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.339
Thanks for the hospitality.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.174
Let's go, Nessa.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.409
Later, Hakeem.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.719
Hey, Cook, Jamal wanted me
to play this demo for you
that he's working on.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.288
You better get dressed
for your date with Angelo.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.023
Uh-uh, no.
The lyrics are too soft.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.658
I need them to be sexier.

16:31.691 --> 16:35.428
Tell him to listen to Marvin
Gaye's "Sexual Healing."

16:36.929 --> 16:39.466
I look like Mrs. Odell,
who went to all the funerals

16:39.499 --> 16:42.369
at my church-- here.
How's the booty?

16:42.402 --> 16:44.804
I mean, you know the emoji
with the big ol' eyes?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.739
Yeah.
That's-that's-that's me.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.609
Angelo better get ready
for all that jelly.
Ha!

16:50.943 --> 16:53.012
No, it's wrong.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.082
Unzip me.
Take this off.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.883
Can you go get Xavier?

16:56.916 --> 16:59.186
Yo, Becky said that
you wanted to see me.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.721
Oh, my God!
That is hot.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.257
You're looking good, ma.
You trying to kill a brother?

17:04.291 --> 17:05.392
(sighs)

17:05.425 --> 17:08.428
I look like Snuffleupagus.
Come on.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.730
* Twists up your spine,
shake your behind *

17:10.763 --> 17:13.833
Xavier, Tiana is doing
a live performance

17:13.866 --> 17:15.702
for Empire XStream
two nights from now,

17:15.735 --> 17:17.670
and it has to be
hotter than July.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.838
Look, she needs to come hard,

17:18.871 --> 17:20.540
like the bad bitch
from "Y U Mad?"

17:20.573 --> 17:24.544
You say-- look, Tiana
is R&B, not hip-hop.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.080
She's right, Tiana's not Nicki.
She's more Rihanna.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.681
Look, just get her in here
for a meeting tomorrow.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.682
I'm on it.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.751
Oh, oh, Chyna Doll, '99.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.886
Yeah, Foxy Brown,
she rocked the joint

17:33.920 --> 17:35.288
just like this one.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.557
I swear to God,
I saw that album cover,

17:37.590 --> 17:39.892
didn't leave my
bedroom for a week.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.094
Just sayin'.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.962
* My head, it's like
I need a Panadol *

17:42.995 --> 17:45.765
* Whine up your body like
you're at a bacchanal, gal *

17:45.798 --> 17:48.201
* Bruk out and whine,
twist up your spine *

17:48.235 --> 17:50.603
* Shake your behind
* Sexy gal

17:50.637 --> 17:52.805
* Your body perfect,
work up a sweat *

17:52.839 --> 17:55.475
* Love the way you set
* Sexy gal

17:55.508 --> 17:56.776
* Boy, you know me look sweet

17:56.809 --> 17:59.279
* I could be the beat
of your heart *

17:59.312 --> 18:01.548
* Sexy gal, sexy gal

18:01.581 --> 18:04.151
* Sexy gal,
sexy gal *

18:04.184 --> 18:05.552
* Sexy gal.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.955
ANGELO (chuckles):
Enjoy the show.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.624
Oh, perfect timing.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.460
All right.
Why are you in a tux?

18:13.493 --> 18:16.062
Oh, I didn't tell you
this was a fund-raiser?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.297
That's my bad.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.631
Okay, maybe I should--
Wait!

18:18.665 --> 18:20.066
I'm not letting you
get away from me...

18:20.099 --> 18:21.401
looking this good.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.004
Ooh, Cookie,
you look stunning.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.609
I'm hyped because
tonight they got Gia singing

18:29.642 --> 18:32.612
from one of my favorite
arias from La Bohème.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.247
Are you an opera fan?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.115
Well, we're about
to find out.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.951
All right.
Thank you.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.420
Wonderful to see you.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.156
Hey, man, it's
good to see you.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.524
You want anything
to drink?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.659
I would like a Hennessy,
please, straight up.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.127
Now, when you
say "Hennessy..."

18:48.161 --> 18:49.496
Hennessy,
Hennessy.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.198
You're good?
Mm-hmm.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.799
Good evening, ladies.

18:52.832 --> 18:56.336
Wow, we didn't think
you'd show.
What's happening?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.004
This is more of a Sabrina thing.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.105
His latest ex.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.441
Cookie, this is Vivian Plumber.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.942
We did Jack and Jill together.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.110
And Bridget Pearce.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.179
Our families summer
together in Oak Bluff.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.948
Where do you stay
on the Vineyard?
The Vineyard?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.016
Martha's Vineyard.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.984
Actually, Cookie spends
most of her summers

19:12.018 --> 19:14.187
running her family's
multibillion-dollar

19:14.221 --> 19:16.189
corporation.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.992
Actually, I have summered
in Connecticut.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.129
At the Danbury Federal
Correctional Institution

19:23.162 --> 19:25.064
for Women.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.202
Ooh.
(chuckles)

19:29.236 --> 19:30.703
That was so real.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.539
That was hot.
I liked that.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.906
That was hot.
Can I go eat?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.141
MAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:35.174 --> 19:36.976
please take your seats.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.513
(classical piano intro)

19:40.547 --> 19:42.682
(applause)

19:49.456 --> 19:51.424
(singing "Musetta's Waltz"
in Italian)

19:51.458 --> 19:54.594
*

20:04.271 --> 20:08.107
*

20:09.876 --> 20:11.444
(whispering):
What is she saying?

20:11.478 --> 20:14.514
Oh, um, it's the story
of a woman caught

20:14.547 --> 20:17.116
in between two men.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.889
*

20:33.600 --> 20:36.736
*

20:47.179 --> 20:50.116
(hitting high note)

20:51.484 --> 20:53.586
(repeats high note)

20:53.620 --> 20:55.522
You better sing that, girl!

20:59.191 --> 21:01.294
(musical piece ends)

21:01.328 --> 21:03.496
(applause)

21:10.437 --> 21:12.405
(sighs)

21:12.439 --> 21:15.007
(door opens, footsteps)

21:15.041 --> 21:17.610
BRIDGET: I just don't know what
he's doing with that hood rat.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.645
VIVIAN:
That's our Angelo.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.012
He's a true playboy.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.014
BRIDGET: Heartbreaker
with a heart of gold.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.950
Just wonder how long
before he tosses

21:23.983 --> 21:26.152
that charity case
back to--

21:26.185 --> 21:27.620
what's the name of that
prison she escaped from?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.422
(laughs)
It won't be long.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.190
He's on the rebound
from Sabrina.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.526
As soon as she
returns from Milan...
(stall door opens)

21:38.331 --> 21:39.966
I got a charity for you.

21:42.068 --> 21:45.171
Make a Wish.
You know that one?

21:45.204 --> 21:50.009
Once I get finished whupping
both of y'all's asses...

21:50.042 --> 21:53.646
you gonna wish you never met
a hood rat like me.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.349
(chuckles)

21:56.383 --> 21:58.551
Just wiping my hands,
bitches.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.361
(sighs)

22:26.112 --> 22:27.580
PORSHA: There's a club
called The Cooper

22:27.614 --> 22:29.416
in Washington Heights
Told you.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.983
That says "The Compound."

22:31.017 --> 22:33.420
And it's in Atlanta, dummy.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.755
Oh.
(phone buzzing)

22:35.788 --> 22:37.356
Well, ain't you gonna
at least hit Angelo back,

22:37.390 --> 22:38.324
so he don't think you somewhere

22:38.357 --> 22:39.559
laying in an alley?

22:39.592 --> 22:40.693
I don't know know
what Angelo was thinking

22:40.727 --> 22:41.828
taking you there anyway.
Please.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.497
Go do something.
Find something.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.065
Get out of my sight right now.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.400
Girl...
So, Gram shades Hakeem,

22:47.434 --> 22:49.168
and Keem shades him back.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.238
And now I'm in a damn sandbox
with two little boys fighting

22:52.271 --> 22:53.406
over whose is bigger.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.507
See?

22:54.541 --> 22:56.075
I knew'd it.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.911
I'm-a go get you a green juice.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.880
Look, Tiana, this beef is
actually gold, all right?

23:00.913 --> 23:02.615
Just think of yourself
like Beyoncé.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.584
The sisters, they're gonna
love watching you

23:04.617 --> 23:06.553
clap back.
"The sisters"?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.421
What do you know
about black women?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.690
My girlfriend's black.
We talk about empowerment

23:10.723 --> 23:12.425
for black women all the time.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.427
Look, Tiana, I hear you, baby.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.597
But your boyfriend
promised your fans

23:17.630 --> 23:18.931
an answer to Hakeem's diss,

23:18.965 --> 23:21.568
so we owe it.
I don't care.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.969
I'm not trying to
be looking like

23:23.002 --> 23:24.804
I'm caught up between
two men, Cookie.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.805
I'm an artist,

23:25.838 --> 23:27.940
not a reality show.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.909
I know you're an artist, baby.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.410
Guess what? artists have been
singing about

23:31.444 --> 23:33.946
this kind of stuff since
the beginning of time.

23:33.980 --> 23:37.083
Have you ever seen the opera,
La Bohème?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.656
(kettle whistling)
ANGELO: No, I wasn't trying
to play her out.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.992
Actually I was trying
to impress her.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.827
I mean maybe
it's just that

23:47.860 --> 23:49.462
y'all come from
different worlds.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.763
No, I don't bite at that, but

23:50.797 --> 23:52.999
(stammers): that's
a false dichotomy.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.636
My mom said something similar

23:56.669 --> 23:58.805
except she used
a different "F" word.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.608
(chuckling):
Touché.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.809
Ah.
Man, look, what you need to do

24:02.842 --> 24:04.977
is you just need to
show her that...

24:05.011 --> 24:07.146
I don't know,
you can hang in her world,

24:07.179 --> 24:08.615
instead of just trying
to make her

24:08.648 --> 24:11.684
fit into yours.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.119
How am I supposed to do that?

24:15.888 --> 24:17.189
I mean, for one,

24:17.223 --> 24:19.258
do you own anything
other than a suit?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.126
I'm just saying.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.128
It...
(both laugh)

24:22.161 --> 24:24.363
I can have my boy,
Paolo, set you up.
Okay.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.332
(laughs)

24:26.365 --> 24:28.635
ANGELO: So, I'll reach out
to your boy, uh, Paolo,

24:28.668 --> 24:29.969
for the threads.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.338
I've been thinking
about Freda Gatz.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.507
You're sure you
want to get her out?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.676
Yeah, they're gonna kill her
in there if I don't.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.947
If a judge were to
declare her non compos mentis

24:40.980 --> 24:42.148
during the shooting...

24:42.181 --> 24:44.517
Wait, so, like
temporary insanity?

24:44.551 --> 24:46.853
Yeah. Do you know if she
has any documented history

24:46.886 --> 24:48.220
of mental illness?

24:48.254 --> 24:49.956
I don't, um...

24:49.989 --> 24:51.357
I don't think so.
(elevator bell dings)

24:51.390 --> 24:52.859
Oh, it's gonna be a
tough needle to thread.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.027
Uh, I tell you what,

24:55.061 --> 24:57.664
Gabrielle Gerard, she's the best
attorney in New York

24:57.697 --> 24:58.865
dealing with this type of stuff.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.032
I'm-a link you two.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.368
Thank you.
Thank you.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.739
QuickBooks?

25:06.773 --> 25:08.207
(chuckles)

25:08.240 --> 25:09.475
Excel.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.911
Listen, uh, the only
reason I let you in here

25:11.944 --> 25:13.713
is because I figured it
was important for you to see

25:13.746 --> 25:14.747
what I'm about.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.583
And I see, he, uh...

25:16.616 --> 25:18.885
has you doing his books.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.720
Math always came natural.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.154
Oh, me, too.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.156
So you should know, Nessa,
the deal Empire's offering

25:24.190 --> 25:25.524
is the best you're gonna get.

25:25.558 --> 25:26.893
There's a sizeable advance,

25:26.926 --> 25:28.695
the royalty rate's on
the high end of reasonable,

25:28.728 --> 25:30.329
and you get to keep

25:30.362 --> 25:32.565
the income stream from
merch and publishing.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.233
It's not that different
from the other labels.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.335
You really want to sign
with Tommy Davoni?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.070
Or some Dutch-owned
conglomerate, really?

25:38.104 --> 25:39.906
So this is a black thing now?

25:39.939 --> 25:42.441
One thing this country's
gonna make sure

25:42.474 --> 25:43.910
you remember, little sister,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.477
it's always a black thing.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.380
Listen, why are you here?

25:48.414 --> 25:50.182
Talking to me
like this one-on-one?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.752
Shine is exploiting you, Nessa.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.721
He's using you to hold off
for a label deal.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.556
I owe Shine, Andre.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.725
He took me in after...

25:58.758 --> 26:01.393
I know all about that.

26:01.427 --> 26:04.096
You know, I met your brother,
Stone, when I was a kid?

26:05.632 --> 26:09.636
I was a senior at Roman Catholic
when I heard he got killed.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.038
I'm sorry about that.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.641
You know, you and me,

26:14.674 --> 26:16.943
Nessa, we're both
from West Philly,

26:16.976 --> 26:21.147
we're both... good at math.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.415
We got a lot in common.
Except...

26:23.449 --> 26:26.085
I didn't go to some
fancy-ass college.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.286
Ah...

26:27.319 --> 26:29.121
The irony is,

26:29.155 --> 26:32.424
you can tell Shine how much
money he's got,

26:32.458 --> 26:33.793
down to the last nickel.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.628
But you have no idea

26:35.662 --> 26:37.496
what you're worth.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.298
This business,

26:39.331 --> 26:41.167
this dangerous,
dangerous business,

26:41.200 --> 26:43.002
it was your brother's,
it was Stone's.

26:43.035 --> 26:47.674
He left it in Shine's care
for you.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.976
Are you gonna take what's yours?

26:52.378 --> 26:53.680
Are you?

26:53.713 --> 26:57.950
If I had your musical talent...

26:57.984 --> 27:00.052
(whispers):
I'd already own Empire.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.595
Not bad, appealing to an
artist's self-interest.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.797
Told you, self-preservation

27:10.830 --> 27:12.932
is the first rule
of nature, son.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.500
Did it work?

27:15.702 --> 27:17.103
Nessa's a smart girl.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.039
We still need to get
Shine's signature, though.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.809
What's up, Andre?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.543
(Andre grunts)

27:26.846 --> 27:27.847
That's what we doing?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.581
We're short-stopping now?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.019
It's all right, Pop.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.620
I got this.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.722
What's up?

27:35.755 --> 27:39.892
(both grunting, landing blows)

27:39.926 --> 27:42.394
Y'all take everything from me.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.362
Oh, hell no.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.831
Not Nessa!

27:44.864 --> 27:46.565
Whoo!
(grunts)

27:49.101 --> 27:50.502
Told you...

27:50.536 --> 27:51.704
that 250 K

27:51.738 --> 27:54.340
for A-Rod's bat
was gonna pay off.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.311
All right, Shine,

27:59.345 --> 28:02.081
let's get down to some business.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.551
You saw The Godfather.

28:05.584 --> 28:08.054
(chuckles)

28:08.087 --> 28:09.688
(spits)

28:09.722 --> 28:11.257
I ain't signing that.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.426
How 'bout that?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.577
You all right, son?

28:31.610 --> 28:32.845
Yeah, Pop.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.480
I'm good.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.787
(Shine grunt echoes)

28:40.820 --> 28:44.090
JUDGE: This emergency bail
hearing is highly unusual,

28:44.123 --> 28:45.557
but counsel made
a compelling argument

28:45.591 --> 28:48.260
on imminent danger
to Ms. Gathers' life.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.195
Your Honor, my client
doesn't dispute

28:49.228 --> 28:50.696
that she shot Jamal Lyon.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.865
But she has no priors.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.467
She's not a known
violent offender.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.804
We're presenting evidence
to the court today to show

28:57.837 --> 29:00.439
that on the night of the
shooting, Ms. Gathers was using

29:00.472 --> 29:02.308
alcohol in combination
with prescription drugs.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.776
This lead to an episode
of intense

29:03.810 --> 29:06.112
temporary paranoia which
in turn, lead Miss Gathers

29:06.145 --> 29:08.080
to take the weapon from
the security guard.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.315
And shoot Mr. Lyon with it.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.283
By mistake, Your Honor.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.752
She was having what the
psychologist here describes

29:13.786 --> 29:15.221
as a fugue episode.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.622
Is this what happened,
Ms. Gathers?

29:18.124 --> 29:20.459
Guess so.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.628
That's a convenient narrative,
Ms. Gerard.

29:22.661 --> 29:26.665
Ms. Gathers has a history
of psychological problems.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.340
Your Honor, may I speak?
Go ahead, Mr. Lyon.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.642
Your Honor, Freda Gathers
is behind bars

29:36.675 --> 29:37.910
because of my family.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.112
Empire...

29:40.146 --> 29:42.181
gave Freda a record contract.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.651
And with that came fans,
and fame, and money.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.820
But nobody's ever
stopped to explain to her

29:47.854 --> 29:49.021
how to cope with that.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.490
Freda grew up in Brownsville,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.993
where an insane and shameful

29:54.026 --> 29:55.694
number of people
end up behind bars.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.230
I'm telling you, she was
about to end that cycle.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.301
But we failed her.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.836
So, yes, I took a bullet,

30:03.870 --> 30:05.104
but while Freda sleeps

30:05.137 --> 30:06.438
in a cold cell in Brooklyn,

30:06.472 --> 30:08.174
I'm recouping in my
luxurious townhouse.

30:08.207 --> 30:12.044
And, I'm sorry, that just
doesn't sound like
justice to me.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.118
Given the dangers to Ms. Gathers

30:19.151 --> 30:20.519
and Mr. Lyon's
statement of support,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.521
the court agrees to grant bail.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.191
The People object, Your Honor.
Duly noted.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.759
GERARD:
We'll have you processed out.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.533
ANNOUNCER:
In 50 seconds, see Tiana live

30:34.566 --> 30:37.069
exclusively on Empire XStream.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.570
COOKIE:
Tiana's clap back song

30:38.604 --> 30:40.739
is about to shut all these
little boys down.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.577
(sighs)
This better work.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.917
What is he doing here?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.051
I mean, it looks
to me like

30:52.084 --> 30:53.519
he about that
club life maybe.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.192
Yo, man, you mind?
Hmm?

31:00.226 --> 31:01.827
(hands clap together)
What's up?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.595
Ugh.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.267
Miss Cookie.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.337
Please allow me to...

31:11.370 --> 31:13.572
ap-- (laughs)

31:13.605 --> 31:17.176
You in my world now, so sit back
and enjoy the ride.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.078
Yes, ma'am.
You might know this song.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.279
And...

31:20.312 --> 31:22.949
*
(quietly):
spot.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.183
Wait for it.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.585
Just wait for it.

31:26.618 --> 31:33.625
(operatic aria):
* Il mio amore

31:37.163 --> 31:44.170
* Il mio amore

31:45.337 --> 31:47.539
Pain, say hello to power.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.709
* Say y'all got the
magic touch but *

31:50.742 --> 31:53.445
* Both of you
been trippin' lately *

31:53.479 --> 31:56.415
* I ain't really 'bout
that rush life *

31:56.448 --> 31:57.916
* Not you or you *

31:57.950 --> 32:01.120
* Talkin' but you sound
so tongue-tied *

32:01.153 --> 32:03.789
* Trippin' over me so crazy

32:03.822 --> 32:07.059
* Sorry but
it doesn't phase me *

32:07.093 --> 32:08.727
* Not you or you *

32:08.760 --> 32:11.130
* Them boys say every day

32:11.163 --> 32:13.799
* Let me get a little bit...
Cookie, we're
not that different.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.501
I truly believe we
could make this work.

32:15.534 --> 32:19.505
* I got me, I'm good
If we want to.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.242
* They could try to promise me
forever *

32:23.275 --> 32:25.577
* But nobody loves me like me

32:25.611 --> 32:28.981
* They could say we're
better off together *

32:29.015 --> 32:30.416
* But nobody loves me like me

32:30.449 --> 32:35.321
Maybe we could make some
great music together.

32:35.354 --> 32:39.525
* Oh, I aint never met
nobody better *

32:39.558 --> 32:43.095
* Nobody loves me
like me-e-e-e-e-e-e *
* Il mio amore *

32:43.129 --> 32:44.663
* Like me-e-e-e

32:44.696 --> 32:48.334
* Nobody loves me
like me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e *

32:48.367 --> 32:50.169
* Like me

32:50.202 --> 32:51.937
* Nobody loves me like me

32:51.970 --> 32:58.977
* Il mio amore...

33:02.514 --> 33:09.521
* Il mio
amore... *

33:11.090 --> 33:13.525
* Nobody loves me like me

33:13.559 --> 33:16.528
* They can try
to promise me forever *

33:16.562 --> 33:18.530
* But nobody loves me like me

33:18.564 --> 33:22.401
* They could say
we're better off together *

33:22.434 --> 33:24.002
* But nobody loves me like me

33:24.036 --> 33:27.873
* This time keep yours
'cause I got mine *

33:27.906 --> 33:32.811
* Oh, I ain't never
met nobody better *

33:32.844 --> 33:36.482
* Nobody loves me
like me-e-e-e-e-e-e *

33:36.515 --> 33:37.749
* Like me-e-e-e-e

33:37.783 --> 33:41.887
* Nobody loves me
like me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e *

33:41.920 --> 33:43.489
* Like me

33:43.522 --> 33:45.524
* Nobody loves me like me.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.427
(all cheering, clamoring)
Yes!

33:48.460 --> 33:51.697
(Lucious vocalizing)

33:52.864 --> 33:55.601
(vocalizing)

33:56.268 --> 33:58.170
That was hot.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.539
You see these numbers
we pulling here?
Mm-hmm.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.573
You telling me
you trying to take

34:01.607 --> 34:03.442
the music
back from me, baby?

34:03.475 --> 34:07.246
You might want to go and
congratulate your little artist

34:07.279 --> 34:09.115
over there.
Excuse me.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.850
Excuse me.
(laughing)

34:11.883 --> 34:14.220
I love that girl.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.422
That's an amazing woman.

34:16.455 --> 34:20.459
Did she ever tell you
how she got the name "Cookie"?

34:23.095 --> 34:25.531
Yo, I had a crazy weekend, man.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.266
Friday and Saturday was insane.

34:27.299 --> 34:30.602
First, my mom
started trippin', but

34:30.636 --> 34:32.804
I met this nice honey, though.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.107
* I woke up early
Friday afternoon *

34:35.141 --> 34:37.643
* Turn my radio up
before I step out the room *

34:37.676 --> 34:40.112
* Lay my clothes on the bed,
make sure they pressed *

34:40.146 --> 34:42.748
* For all the little wannabes
tryin' to take my fresh *

34:42.781 --> 34:44.983
* But anyway now I'm
on my way outside *

34:45.016 --> 34:48.220
* Saying hi to the honeys
as I'm passing by *

34:48.254 --> 34:49.921
* When fights break out,
you know we ain't running *

34:49.955 --> 34:51.657
* Only time
we take off is when *

34:51.690 --> 34:53.125
* Police is coming

34:53.159 --> 34:55.627
* No, we don't
wanna hurt nobody *

34:55.661 --> 34:58.330
* All we really
wanna do is party, yeah *

34:58.364 --> 35:00.399
* No, we ain't
tryna hurt nobody *

35:00.432 --> 35:03.302
* All we really
wanna do is party, hey. *

35:03.335 --> 35:05.571
* My Adidas

35:05.604 --> 35:06.972
* Walk through concert doors

35:07.005 --> 35:09.141
* And roam all over
coliseum floors... *

35:09.175 --> 35:10.776
What's up,
Moonshine?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.077
How we doing at the door?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.279
Making bank, homie.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.681
People going wild
for them rhymes.

35:15.714 --> 35:16.982
Yo.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.184
Hey, yo, uh,

35:18.217 --> 35:20.519
somebody here,

35:20.552 --> 35:22.921
asking for Loretha.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.623
Uh-oh, the Cook's
plumbing van

35:24.656 --> 35:26.258
coming for Cookie again.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.293
Loretha.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.827
Nah.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.196
From now on,

35:30.229 --> 35:32.097
you're my Cookie.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.865
Loretha?
Uh--

35:33.899 --> 35:35.501
Barry, what are you
doing here?

35:35.534 --> 35:36.835
Come to get my girl.
(chuckles)

35:36.868 --> 35:39.438
What's up, youngbo?
Lucious.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.273
Get your hands off me!
Lucious, Lucious.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.175
Nah, nah, I'm just gonna
take him out the side door

35:43.209 --> 35:44.676
and talk for a minute.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.213
* My Adidas standing
on two fifth street *

35:47.246 --> 35:50.516
* Funky fresh and yes,
cold on my feet with no... *

35:52.184 --> 35:54.286
*

35:54.320 --> 35:56.121
Look, Lucious, I'm not--

35:56.154 --> 35:57.389
(whoops)

35:57.423 --> 35:59.057
(thuds)

35:59.090 --> 36:01.560
(grunting)

36:06.031 --> 36:08.400
(grunts, groans)

36:08.434 --> 36:09.868
(coughs)

36:09.901 --> 36:13.239
Just so we're clear,
she's mine.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.406
Long story short--

36:14.440 --> 36:16.808
baby boy should've
walked away, but

36:16.842 --> 36:19.645
he ain't had
a good sense to.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.079
But me and Cookie,
we've been in this situation

36:21.112 --> 36:23.515
many times before
and somehow or another,

36:23.549 --> 36:26.151
we always find ourselves
back together again.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.619
You what I'm saying?

36:31.223 --> 36:33.859
We'll see about that.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.598
(laughs)

36:42.568 --> 36:46.272
Congratulations, my son,
on getting Freda out.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.173
See, sometimes you do

36:48.206 --> 36:52.177
have to do the wrong thing
to get the right results.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.712
I had to, Dad.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.414
She would've been
killed in there.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.748
I know.

36:56.782 --> 36:59.217
That's why I had
her ass beat in there.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.720
(laughing)

37:03.789 --> 37:05.056
I mean,
Freda was down for it.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.458
She knew that was
the only way

37:06.492 --> 37:07.793
she was ever gonna
get out of there.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.595
Where the damn
spoons at, man?

37:09.628 --> 37:11.196
No, no, wait.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.600
So, you're saying that Freda
played me the whole time?

37:14.633 --> 37:18.003
Even with the whole, uh,
temporary insanity thing.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.772
What I was most proud of

37:20.806 --> 37:23.208
was the fact that you...

37:23.241 --> 37:24.976
you paid off that doctor

37:25.010 --> 37:27.112
to make reports
for that judge.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.880
'Cause, see, now,

37:28.914 --> 37:30.616
no matter
what she ever says

37:30.649 --> 37:33.285
in a court of law,
it'll never be credible.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.053
So that nonsense about

37:35.086 --> 37:36.888
me having something to do
with whatever happened

37:36.922 --> 37:39.658
(laughing):
with her father...

37:39.691 --> 37:43.061
But the beauty is I didn't
have to tell you to do it.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.964
I didn't have
to threaten you or nothing.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.266
It was like it was
second nature to you.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.035
Like a Lyon.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.941
How's it feel to know
you're just like your daddy?

37:57.509 --> 37:59.678
I'm seeing myself
in you, man.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.160
(vocalizing)

38:17.463 --> 38:18.997
I'm working.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.066
It's not your fault
what happened, you know.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.172
Do you think
I'm a good person?

38:27.205 --> 38:29.508
I'm not in a position
to judge.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.876
But I know you got
work left to do

38:30.909 --> 38:33.011
if you want
to get over your PTSD.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.980
Yeah.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.385
We should just do it together.
You want me to help you?

38:39.418 --> 38:41.587
I don't see why not. I mean,
you've been through it yourself.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.356
All I know is
that this is stupid.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.691
I got to go on, uh, tour.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.526
I got to get back on stage.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.727
All right.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.530
I'll call you to set it up.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.031
Cool.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.232
Have a good night.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.035
You, too.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.742
You don't want
to be mixing those

39:03.775 --> 39:05.577
with alcohol, man.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.018
(quiet laugh)

39:14.453 --> 39:15.887
No, you're right.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.256
Um...

39:18.289 --> 39:19.257
I wasn't even thinking.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.526
(puts cap back on)

39:20.559 --> 39:22.528
I mean, I'm fine
right now, anyway.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.396
Okay.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.197
That's a good song.

39:26.231 --> 39:28.867
Thank you.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.302
(elevator bell dings)

39:40.278 --> 39:41.947
(playing piano)

39:44.282 --> 39:49.688
* I'm so lost in the fog
of this mirror *

39:49.721 --> 39:53.725
* I'm in-between two places

39:53.759 --> 39:57.796
* And I'm...

39:58.797 --> 40:01.933
* I'm struggling

40:01.967 --> 40:06.104
* Said it's so,
so hard for me to do right *

40:06.137 --> 40:08.339
* In the middle of wrong

40:10.576 --> 40:13.645
* I know I must stay strong

40:13.679 --> 40:17.849
* Ooh...

40:19.317 --> 40:21.252
Mm.

40:22.287 --> 40:23.455
(humming)

40:23.489 --> 40:25.090
(heavy bass echoes)

40:25.123 --> 40:26.792
* This is crazy

40:26.825 --> 40:29.795
* How in the world
did this happen? *

40:29.828 --> 40:31.963
