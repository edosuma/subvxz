just at Dad's favorite spot.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.704
-Dad had a favorite spot?
-You know, under the oak tree.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.999
We used to sit out there all the time.
None of you ever did that?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.292
Will there be refreshments?

22:16.335 --> 22:19.629
Tea? Scones?
Cucumber sandwiches are always a winner.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.632
What? No. And put that out.
Dad didn't allow smoking in here.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.760
-Is that my skirt?
-What?

22:24.843 --> 22:27.637

22:38.690 --> 22:39.775

22:39.858 --> 22:42.444
I don't understand. I thought they said
it was a heart attack.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.653
Yeah, according to the coroner.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.447
-Well, wouldn't they know?
-Theoretically.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.365
Theoretically?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.992
I'm just saying, at the very least,
something happened.
The last time that I talked to Dad,
he sounded strange.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.164
[gurgling] Oh, <i>quelle surprise!</i>

22:54.623 --> 22:55.457
Strange how?

22:55.540 --> 22:59.044
He sounded on edge.
Told me I should be careful who to trust.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.380
Luther, he was a paranoid, bitter old man

23:01.463 --> 23:03.590
who was starting to lose
what was left of his marbles.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.842
No. He must have known
something was going to happen.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.345
Look, I know you don't like to do it,

23:08.428 --> 23:09.930
but I need you to talk to Dad.

23:10.013 --> 23:10.931
[scoffs]

23:11.848 --> 23:16.436

for a moment and take a quick call?"

23:35.956 --> 23:36.915
It's worthless.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.126

I think it was personal.

Someone with a grudge.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.248
jumping through time
is a toss of the dice.

34:46.834 --> 34:47.668
Nice dress.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.337
Oh, well, danke!

34:49.420 --> 34:50.755
Wait, how did you get back?

34:50.838 --> 34:53.007
In the end, I had to project
my consciousness forward

34:53.091 --> 34:55.760
into a suspended quantum state version
of myself

34:55.843 --> 34:58.262
that exists
across every possible instance of time.

34:58.846 --> 34:59.889
That makes no sense.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.349
Well, it would if you were smarter.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.436
-How long were you there?
-Forty-five years. Give or take.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.691
So what are you saying? That you're 58?

35:11.067 --> 35:13.820
No, my consciousness is 58.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.656
Apparently, my body is now 13 again.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.491
Wait, how does that even work?

35:18.574 --> 35:21.410
Delores kept saying
the equations were off. Eh.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.454
Bet she's laughing now.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.497
Delores?

35:25.373 --> 35:26.374
Hmm.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.793
-Guess I missed the funeral.
-How'd you know about that?

35:28.876 --> 35:30.711
What part of the future
do you not understand?

35:31.379 --> 35:32.255
Heart failure, huh?

35:32.338 --> 35:33.464
-Yeah.
-No.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.133
[Five] Hmm.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.426
[clicks tongue]
Nice to see nothing's changed.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.471
Uh, that's it? That's all you have to say?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.516
[Five] What else is there to say?
The circle of life.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.270
Well...

35:48.980 --> 35:49.981
That was interesting.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.366
Ah, shit.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.000
Nice to know Dad didn't forget me.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.128
Read your book, by the way.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.756
Found it in a library
that was still standing.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.555
I thought it was pretty good,
all things considered.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.807
Yeah, definitely ballsy,

36:25.308 --> 36:27.101
giving up the family secrets.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.730
Sure that went over well.

36:31.147 --> 36:31.981
They hate me.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.108
Oh, there are worse things
that can happen.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.319
You mean like what happened to Ben?

36:38.237 --> 36:39.071
Was it bad?

36:44.535 --> 36:46.537
[thunder rumbles]

36:56.797 --> 36:57.757
[door opens]

37:13.940 --> 37:15.066
Did something happen?

37:17.652 --> 37:20.238
Dad died. Remember?

37:20.446 --> 37:22.657
Oh. Yes, of course.

37:24.033 --> 37:24.951
Is Mom okay?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.119
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.623
She just needs to rest.
You know, recharge.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.545
Whenever you're ready, dear boy.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.112
Probably would have been better
with some wind.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.032
Does anyone wish to speak?

38:10.162 --> 38:11.289
Very well.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.544
In all regards,

38:17.044 --> 38:21.716
Sir Reginald Hargreeves
made me what I am today.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.555
For that alone,
I shall forever be in his debt.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.808
He was my master...

38:32.643 --> 38:33.978
and my friend,

38:35.771 --> 38:37.773
and I shall miss him very much.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.489
He leaves behind a complicated legacy--

38:45.573 --> 38:46.949
He was a monster.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.117
[laughs]

38:48.826 --> 38:51.370
He was a bad person and a worse father.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.832
-The world's better off without him.
-Diego.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.709
My name is Number Two.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.461
You know why?

38:59.170 --> 39:02.590
Because our father couldn't be bothered
to give us actual names.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.592
He had Mom do it.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.344
[Mom] Would anyone like something to eat?

39:06.427 --> 39:07.720
No, it's okay, Mom.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.014
Oh, okay.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.100
Look, you wanna pay your respects?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.395
Go ahead.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.565
But at least be honest
about the kind of man he was.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.150
You should stop talking now.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.280
You know, you of all people should be
on my side here, Number One.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.281
I am warning you.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.325
[Diego] After everything he did to you?

39:30.117 --> 39:32.703
He had to ship you a million miles away.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.246
Diego, stop talking.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.500
That's how much
he couldn't stand the sight of you!

39:38.751 --> 39:40.878

You got enough material
for your sequel yet?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.000
He was my father, too.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.597

41:17.766 --> 41:19.226
