It's Andy Cohen's act. It can't be that good.

But the guy's a hash slinger.

I'll give you my card.

And they ask me, will I do the honors?

They sit me next to Wexler over here

who's been in my ear all night telling me

03:14.640 --> 03:18.281
how he's recorded every schvartze
since Booker T. Washington.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.840
And speaking of schvartzes,
Berry Gordy's here.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.729
There he is.
I know a lot of you thought he was the waiter,

but, no, it's not. It's him.

So, who else? We got Neil Bogart here.

Just started his new label.

and then I knew.

He's about to unload...
I mean, sell, his record company to PolyGram.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.561
But what does he do?
He walks away from the deal.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.802
He walks away from it.
The Krauts were so dumb,

03:58.880 --> 04:03.010
they were actually gonna buy it,
but Richie saves them from themselves

04:03.880 --> 04:05.769

No, but seriously, they asked me
to say some nice things about Maury,

but honestly, what's the point?

04:18.760 --> 04:22.242
I mean, there is no amount of flowery bullshit

04:22.320 --> 04:25.290
that I could say
that Maury wouldn't say about himself.

Yeah, she said she loved working with you,

12:54.520 --> 12:56.488
You can never <i>keep</i> me

12:56.560 --> 13:00.326

- Cut him.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.170
- Terry Jacks.
- SCOTT: Who?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.641
- Exactly.
- SKIP: Lot of Ks and Ws, but no sales.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.165

13:38.240 --> 13:41.562
Dr. Hook stays, obviously.
Thin Lizzy. Hannibal.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.925
- Status Quo?
- Gone.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.129
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>Pictures</i> of <i>Matchstick Men</i> topped <i>the</i> charts.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.884

wearing your Nehru jacket.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.962
Anybody else object to dropping Status Quo?

13:51.040 --> 13:53.327
- I said fucking cut them!
- I thought we were voting.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.529
Whether to keep us in the dark ages?
Guys, I'm trying to bring us into the future.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.683
Okay, that's great, Captain Video,
but while you're over there in the future,

13:59.760 --> 14:01.888
I'm here in the present
trying to keep the fucking lights on.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.281
Okay, so do Status Quo make any money?

14:04.600 --> 14:05.931
- Not really.
- Well, then, fuck them.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.321
Guys, we cut deadwood, okay?

14:08.480 --> 14:11.882
Then we got money to bring in new acts
so we can promote the shit out of them

14:11.960 --> 14:15.442

but, poor you, I never give you the firepower.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.002
Right, right, 'cause it's all about you
making my dreams come true.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.401
- Yeah, right. Who's next?
- The album?

14:21.480 --> 14:23.448
- On your list.
- Grand Funk.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.690
- Got to keep Grand Funk.
- How are their numbers?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.370
- SKIP: Uh, decent.
- They're selling out stadiums.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.010
- How's the catalog doing?
- Well, good.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.366
We're moving some units on the touring.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.527
Six months left on their contract.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.450
You run the clock out on them,
then we decide.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.082
Okay, uh, Johnny Winter.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.208
Sales are steady. Album's holding in the 40s.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.566
He's an albino.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.320

- ZAK: Keep him.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.561
No, they're a band. They do dance music.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.086
They're in the studio now.
They're finishing an album for us.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.686
- I'm hearing good things.
- Then let's see what we get.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.721
Zak, Heather's got your accountant
on the phone.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.446
He said you left a bunch of messages,
so we should interrupt you.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.726
I'll call him back.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.641
Don't let me stop you.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.929
Well, I got no fucking money left,
so what's to talk about?

15:20.840 --> 15:23.923
- Where are we?
- We trimmed 70% of our roster, give or take.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.331
- That's big savings.
- ZAK: It's not cash.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.607
- We need to generate cash.
- For all the lights and all that.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.048
Or maybe a little extra
so I can take my girlfriend to Gray's Papaya.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.521
Jesus Christ, when the fuck did you guys
become a bunch of crybabies?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.204
Since you stuck it up our asses, Richie.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.362
Maybe you were prepared not to sell,
but we fucking weren't.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.044
You want me to buy you out? Fine.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.964
Yeah, now that the valuation of this company
is dog shit.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.486
SCOTT: It's negative dog shit.
We'd actually owe you money.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.444
All right. Let's get one of our artists
to record a Christmas album.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.965
Even the shitty ones sell.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.849
Jackson Five and that fucking

15:56.160 --> 15:58.288
"Mommy's Making Out With Santa Claus."

15:58.360 --> 16:00.089
How many weeks did that thing
hang out in the top five?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.127
Yeah, it's like printing money, man.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.645
- It's August already, Richie.
- So rush it.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.006
Fucking songs are written already.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.366
It would keep some cash flowing.

Santa hat, fucking elves with tambourines.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.524

And that other guy.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.807
What's that other guy's name?
The guy with the hairy chest?

16:13.880 --> 16:16.201
- The Long <i>Goodbye</i> guy.
- That's Elliott Gould.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.487
- He could do a Christmas album.
- He's Jewish.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.244
Sister Mary Melissa could do it.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.049
Not a Jew. That I know.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.810
I mean, a nun, too religious.
What are her numbers?

over three million copies.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.126
You don't like it there?

23:57.200 --> 24:00.841
No, I love it.
I can jerk off to it when you're not home.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.689
(CHUCKLING) When am I not home?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.808
It's a pretty nice fucking home.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.003
- Mmm. I'm just antsy.
- Yeah?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.889
-(BABY BABBLING)
- Did you replace Andrea yet?

24:09.960 --> 24:12.008
- No.
- I'm available.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.920
Don't you think you've got
your hands full right now?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.650
We've got Estella.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.166
I could work part-time.
We could ride in together.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.767
Babe, you won't get me coffee here.
You're gonna get me coffee at the office?

24:22.840 --> 24:26.083
She kept that office running.
She was the woman behind the man.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.650
I would be good at that.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.769
You shouldn't be behind anybody.
Look at that face.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.411
Do something out here.
It's a fucking wasteland.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.090
Start your own theater company.
Your own fucking Warhol Factory.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.885
-(LAUGHING)
- Well, why not?

24:43.240 --> 24:45.607
Gloria thinks there should be
a ballet company out here.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.843
- Oh, yeah?
- I hate the ballet.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.331
Get her to do that modern shit you love.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.845
I thought you enjoyed it last time.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.685
I did. I loved it.
I mean, the thing with the cow head?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.410
-(LAUGHING)
- Ooh!

24:59.200 --> 25:00.486
Stop.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.002
(BABY CRYING)

25:09.040 --> 25:11.611
I don't want to do anything with Gloria.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.445
She's a bitch.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.802
When are we gonna have another kid?

25:19.360 --> 25:23.843
(CHUCKLING) That is incongruent
with me starting a revolution in Greenwich.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.161
Yeah, but it gets us another kid.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.724
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.806
DEVON: That's not helping me think.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.328
- RICHIE: I think it is.
-(DEVON LAUGHING)

25:59.840 --> 26:01.842
(MUSIC PLAYING)

26:01.920 --> 26:04.321
<i>Good gosh almighty now</i>

26:04.400 --> 26:06.801
<i>Shala-boom-boom, yeah...</i>

26:07.200 --> 26:08.486
All right, first things first.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.722
From a public relations standpoint,
it's critical

26:10.800 --> 26:13.531
that not selling the company
is perceived as a show of strength.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.763
We at American Century
believe in ourselves and our artists.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.049
Right, except that
we're dumping 70% of them.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.645
We believe in some of our artists.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.609
Listen to me. I need you to spin this

26:23.680 --> 26:25.921
so that it doesn't look like
we're a sinking ship

26:26.000 --> 26:27.729
-tossing deadweight overboard.
- Are we?

26:27.800 --> 26:30.770
No. No, we're taking on a little bit of water,
that's all.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.968
- Who isn't in this economy?
- Did you see Koronet's numbers?

26:33.480 --> 26:34.641
They put out a release yesterday.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.609
I... Hey, fuck them, right?

26:36.680 --> 26:39.923
Listen to me. This prick Jackie Jervis
is shooting his mouth off.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.685
It's making us look bad.
Okay, how about this?

26:43.320 --> 26:48.611
We're trimming the fat, staying lean.
The old roster had no coherence.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.967
It was a cornucopia of disparate sounds.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.088
Okay, cornucopia sounds vaguely good.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.127
Right, I'll come up with something else.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.091
In any case, part two.
I'm starting a sublabel.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.728
- Like Atlantic has Atco.
- Exactly, okay?

27:00.800 --> 27:05.203
American Century stays intact,
but with a fresh imprint. In-house.

27:05.800 --> 27:10.966
I need you to come up with a new label, okay?
A label that says "tomorrow, the future."

27:11.720 --> 27:12.960
Atomic Records.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.884
The future starting today, not 1942.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.771
- Rock-It.
- No.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.767
Not Rocket, but Rock-It. You get it?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.047
- Yeah, I do. Still no.
-(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

27:23.360 --> 27:27.729
Hey, Richie.
There's been a lot of rumors about layoffs.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.129
You're a part of this team, Hal.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.770
- Am I?
- Hey, an integral part.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.641
- Jesus, all right.
- All right.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.643
- Hey, Kelly just got into Amherst.
- Look at that.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.842
- Yeah. Blast Off.
- No.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.685
Keep thinking.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.961
Hey, Joe. I heard you called.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.840
Yeah, I figured Angela Davis
didn't give you the message.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.961
You know, you're becoming
a really hard guy to track down.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.009
I called you several times.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.562
You're becoming like
one of those animals that people hunt.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.808
You know, those animals with the antlers.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.123
- A deer?
- No, Richie.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.247
A buck.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.366
Yeah, buck, right.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.726
Remember Nora? You met her the other night.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.484
Yeah, of course. Hey, how are you?

28:12.560 --> 28:16.690
Turns out... Listen. Turns out she's a singer.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.207
She's got a voice like a gazelle.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.411
Really?

28:22.120 --> 28:23.167
(STAMMERS) What do you sing?

28:23.600 --> 28:26.922
Jazz, blues, nursery rhymes.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.843
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forget about nursery rhymes.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.167
She's your next Petula Clark.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.761
Hey, listen.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.246
Consider this as a gift

28:37.120 --> 28:38.849
from me to you.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.889
'Cause that's what friends do.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.726
Particularly friends that have
a unique shared history together.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.690
Hey, what have you heard about that?

28:48.280 --> 28:50.726
What have I heard about it?
There's nothing to fucking hear.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.689
- He's gone. He's morto. You understand?
- Okay.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.161
Forget about that, okay?
Here's what we're gonna do.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.363
You listen to it, all right, Richie?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.570
And then we'll make a record.
I'll promote the shit out of it.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.324
You know what? I'm gonna listen to it.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.767
He's the best. Hey, put your head up.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.969
Remember what I said.
You've got to project confidence to him.

29:08.240 --> 29:12.325
- Now say thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Finestra.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.169
And she can fuck like a dolphin.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.842
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:28.200 --> 29:30.680
So we get to the hotel and it's a zoo.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.127
You know, there's a lobby full of girls,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.407
kids chasing me for autographs,
the whole bit.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.444
I finally make it to the elevator

29:37.520 --> 29:40.603
and I look past Norm,
who was guarding the door,

29:40.680 --> 29:43.160
and across the way are Glen, Mike, and Neal

29:43.240 --> 29:46.608
in another elevator,
two guards in front of them,

29:46.720 --> 29:49.849
you know, arms folded like storm troopers.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.366
-(LAUGHING)
- Except there's no one.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.920
Not a single person
is paying them a lick of attention.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.651
And I'm shelling out
a fortune to these gorillas

29:57.720 --> 29:59.484
to guard these guys from...

29:59.560 --> 30:00.971
Nothing. Phantoms.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.327
- Hey, Alice.
- I mean, it's... Hi.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.482
It's wasteful, man. You know?

30:05.560 --> 30:09.690
Alice may be all about excess,
but me, Vince, I'm from Phoenix.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.603
I went to school with Indian kids,
couldn't afford pants.

30:11.680 --> 30:15.162
Yeah, see, this kind of shit
would never go down if you were with me.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.605
You'd have fired those bodyguards?

30:16.680 --> 30:18.125
No, no, no, I'd keep them,

30:18.200 --> 30:20.328
but I'd also hire a bunch of chicks
to rush your boys

30:20.400 --> 30:23.404
so you don't have an ego problem
to deal with.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.450
Last thing you need is
that shit following you onstage.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.483
- That's genius.
- Let me get with Richie.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.725
We'll come up with a whole plan.
I don't want you worrying about anything.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.003
- Na zdorovie, man.
- Yep, okay.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.568
Uh, uh, uh, uh. Bottoms up or it's bad luck.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.280
Oh, right.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.841
Third one on the match dies, huh?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.440
Mmm-hmm.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.686
-(LAUGHING)
- I don't know why I threw it.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.843
Wait, so why isn't Shemp
dealing with this shit?

30:51.920 --> 30:53.843
- I mean, isn't he your manager?
- Shep.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.081
- Got it.
- I love the guy,

30:55.160 --> 30:56.810
but honestly, he's part of the problem.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.963
You know? He's the one who doesn't want
the guys at the press conference.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.605
But then I have to deal with the fallout.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.202
That's all the more reason
you need to be on your own.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.760
Can you imagine
if I didn't have to take a dump

31:06.840 --> 31:08.001
when you were in that hallway?

31:08.080 --> 31:11.050
Oh, my God. Here's Johnny.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.407
- Motherfucker.
- How are you?

31:13.480 --> 31:16.563
- Thought you were on tour.
- No, man, going out again for Christmas.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.085
Hey, you know Clark?

31:18.160 --> 31:21.209
Johnny Thunders, meet Clark...
Some-or-such.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.567
Hey, I heard you sold out the Whiskey
in, like, six hours.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.406
You think I give a shit
about the fucking box office?

31:26.880 --> 31:30.089
-(STUTTERS) No.
- Hey, don't be a fucking asshole.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.721
Dad issues. Never goes away.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.803
(BOTH LAUGHING)

31:36.080 --> 31:38.003
Don't worry about it.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.522
Whoa. Beautiful.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.083
Gloria wants a check for $10,000.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.571
RICHIE: Me, too.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.484
Well, it's for the fundraiser.
She wants to hold it up, flap it around.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.483
Doesn't her husband
have a checking account?

31:51.560 --> 31:54.643
It's $10,000, not $20,000 like we agreed.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.767
I don't understand.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.127
What's everybody else gonna be doing
at this dinner?

31:58.200 --> 31:59.611
Admiring our philanthropy?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.489
They see our chunk and then they pony up.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.403
I mean, 10's barely gonna get us the roof.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.402
Wait, who's doing this roof? Michelangelo?

32:07.480 --> 32:08.766
Look, we agreed to 20.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.002
I'm asking you for half.
Can you just cut the goddamn check?

32:11.080 --> 32:13.890
You know what? Why don't we get somebody
to play at the thing?

32:13.960 --> 32:16.440
Free entertainment. Somebody like Dr. Hook.
Somebody good.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.681
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.641
Dev, I told you.
It's a temporary belt tightening.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.450
-"Nothing's gonna change, Dev."
- Hey, let me ask you something.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.841
When's the last time
you went hungry in this house?

32:26.960 --> 32:30.407
Huh? Or the last time the electric bill
wasn't paid? Or the housekeeper.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.086
You know damn well
this has nothing to do with basic necessities.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.766
Right, it's got to do with
your precious dance troupe.

32:35.840 --> 32:39.083
They are not a troupe, okay?
The Girl Scouts are a troop.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.924
This is a group of world-renowned artists

32:41.000 --> 32:44.891
who escaped the goddamn Iron Curtain
because I promised them sponsorship.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.644
- Which now apparently was a lie.
- Please. Give me a break.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.643
Don't give me
that oppressed artist shit, okay?

32:48.720 --> 32:50.802
They were a bunch
of prima goddamn ballerinas

32:50.880 --> 32:53.008
in whatever Slovakatinia they come from.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.764
Well, now they're gonna be living in
our basement.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.042
Good thing they don't eat much, dancers.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.689
Get out of my fucking bedroom.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.087
What?

33:02.680 --> 33:07.288
This is what I had.
This is what you threw me like a child.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.403
"Go play with the dance troupe, Dev.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.921
"They need your brilliant fucking strategizing.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.122
"You know, it'll be great for you.
Get you out of the house."

33:14.240 --> 33:17.483
- And it did.
- The strategy is fundraising, Richie.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.166
- That is the strategy.
- JENNA: Mommy.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.921
Very nice. Good job.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.808
Come on, honey. Back to bed.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.768
(MUSIC PLAYING)

33:34.560 --> 33:36.528
<i>Ow, candy everywhere</i>

33:36.600 --> 33:37.931
<i>Got chocolate in my hair...</i>

33:38.000 --> 33:39.923
- Can you even see it?
- Not really.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.284
Oh, nothing like
the last whiskey of the night, huh?

33:47.720 --> 33:50.769
Except the first beer of the day.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.881
(CHUCKLING)

33:52.240 --> 33:53.810
Oh. (CHUCKLING)

33:54.440 --> 33:56.044
Boys are gonna be upset.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.168
- They'll get over it.
- It's easy for you to say.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.720
You don't have to tell them
and then be onstage with them for two hours.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.967
I'll tell them.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.371
You know, you don't even
have to be in the building.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.121
Plus, I can get every one of them solo albums.
You know, I'll call my friend at Atlantic.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.043
That way, they're not pissed.
They're delighted.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.724
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.451
For Alice Cooper, are you kidding me?
Of course, I... Whoa.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.888
Um, what is she...

34:17.960 --> 34:21.681

And apparently something similar
sold at Christie's for nearly $22,000.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.611

- That's fantastic.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.409
It'll cover most of the construction.
