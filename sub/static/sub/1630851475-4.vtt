WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:07.549
-I love this photo of Walter.
-Mm, so cute.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.677
You got a hottie for a boyfriend.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.431
Boyfriend? Is he my boyfriend?

00:14.514 --> 00:15.682
I mean, I know he likes me,

00:15.765 --> 00:17.892
but we haven't really defined
the relationship yet.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.228
That's okay.
Kai and I haven't DTR'd yet, either.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.605
I consider us as "engaged to be engaged."

00:22.689 --> 00:24.774
How serious can Walter be about me?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.693
I'm not even on his main Instagram grid.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.070
If I was his girlfriend, I'd be on main.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.280
How come I'm not on main?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.073
Lahela, relax.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.158
You've said it yourself,

00:33.241 --> 00:35.076
you and Walter don't have
any cute couple shots.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.120
Get the pics, get on main.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.290
Stephanie Marie Denisco, you are a genius!

00:40.373 --> 00:42.208
Game recognizes game.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.045
Walter and I are going
to Big Kanoa's Tiny Golf tomorrow.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.882
There's this waterfall on the sixth hole
that would make a great backdrop.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.133
You should come and take pics.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.094
Um, a third-wheel paparazzi
might seem weird.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.346
Maybe if we had a fourth?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.827
Oh, no, my slipper!

01:22.082 --> 01:22.999
Hey, Kai!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.627
Wanna go mini golfing with me,
Steph, and Walter tomorrow?

01:30.131 --> 01:31.299
We're all set.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.226
<i>Hospital efficiency.</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:45.146
How we use
or misuse our time is extremely...

01:45.230 --> 01:46.856
Mom! Do you know where the flour is?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.192
I need it for the Oahu Pie Competition.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.861
Since you guys loved
my cookie cake so much,

01:51.945 --> 01:53.363
here's my next idea.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.615
One word. Cookie pie.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.743
That's two words,
and the flour is next to the canola oil.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.661
Cool.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.081
What's canola oil?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.375
I'll find the flour,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.837
but then, you have to let me rehearse
my presentation for the Chief of Staff.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.548
Why do you even care what that guy thinks?
You don't even like him.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.633
You call him "Dr. Name Dropper."

02:13.716 --> 02:16.803
Dr. Name Dropper is still
the head of the hospital.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.639
And any time I get a chance
to present to him

02:19.722 --> 02:23.101
is an opportunity for me
to effect real change at work.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
Even if I have to listen to his story

02:25.270 --> 02:27.939
about running a 5K
with Bruno Mars' hat guy.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.232
-Move.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.570
I live with ferrets.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.196
Hospital efficiency.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.574
How we use or misuse our time

02:37.657 --> 02:38.867
-is extremely--
-Mom!

02:39.492 --> 02:40.618
You didn't finish my rock.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.955
The Greek Gods show is tonight,
and I can't be Sisyphus with this.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.498
It's just a beach ball.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.208
Your show's not until four.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.043
I'm gonna wrap the ball in butcher paper

02:49.127 --> 02:51.129
as soon as I finish
rehearsing my presentation.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.089
And after you find me the flour.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.049
-Yeah.
-And get Dad out of the good bathroom.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.342
He's been in there all morning,

02:56.426 --> 02:58.595
and I need the floor-length mirror
to check my fit.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.638
Hey, babe, do you know
where the moisturizer is?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.265
I need to maintain my dewy glow.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.185
And I need to finish my presentation!

03:05.894 --> 03:07.812
I am locking myself in the bathroom.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.355
Nobody bother me.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.691
See if my moisturizer's in there.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.195
All this pretty takes work.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.085
See, the key to putting

03:31.169 --> 03:34.130
is to figure out the magnitude
and angle of the total velocity.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.759
You know, your basic Pythagorean theorem.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.677
Yeah, I don't think Steph and I
have reached that chapter yet.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.972
Well, you don't need to be good at math
to know that Walter is getting wrecked.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.141
Hey, it's been hard to line up a putt,
my side hurts.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.684
I think I pulled something while surfing.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.852
You'll turn it around at the next hole.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.940
It's my favorite
because of the picturesque waterfall.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.575
Waterfalls are so romantic.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.745
Swimming in them, standing next to them.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.665
Using your good side to gaze at a rock...

04:09.290 --> 04:10.124
Steph!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.751
-We've gotta keep these good vibes going.
-Steph!

04:11.834 --> 04:14.712
I heard about an escape room in Mililani.
We should go.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.382
Oh, yeah. I've always wanted
to try one of those escape room things.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.508
It'll be so fun.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.426
You guys in? Say you're in.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.594
Yeah, we're in.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.805
Steph, could you grab a pic?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.516
Right, sorry. Sorry.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.519
Here we go.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.943
Love it. Now let's try one like you didn't
just get kicked in the nads by a donkey.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.528
-My bad.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.113
Okay, I'm ready.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.825
-You okay?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.619
Yeah, I'm good.
I... it's just my stomach again.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.705
Can you tell me where the pain is?

04:48.788 --> 04:52.125
It was here,
but it's kind of moved to the side.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.044
-Have you had your appendix out?
-No, why?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.214
Pain transferring from the center
of the abdomen to the lower right quadrant

04:58.298 --> 05:00.341
is usually a sign of appendicitis.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.592
But I won't know for sure

05:01.676 --> 05:03.636
until I can check your white blood count
at the hospital.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.179
I don't have to go to the hospital.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.889
I'm fine. Let us...

05:14.647 --> 05:17.734
This is Dr. Kamealoha. Prepare the OR.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.981
I mean, do I really need surgery?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.692
Well, during my examination,
you exhibited "rebound tenderness,"

05:59.776 --> 06:03.154
which can be a sign that
your appendix is close to rupturing.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.114
-That sounds bad.
-It's gonna be okay.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.033
I called ahead.
They're getting the OR prepped.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.410
We have the best surgeons.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.922
What's going on?

06:21.005 --> 06:24.133
Multi-car pile-up on the H-1.
Just happened. More coming!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.760
Dr. Lee, I called about an appy.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.929
We have the patient being prepped.
Who's on the schedule?

06:28.012 --> 06:30.264
I need a crash cart
to exam room one. Stat!

06:30.348 --> 06:33.017
-Everybody's busy. You do the appy.
-Oh, but, no. I...

06:33.101 --> 06:34.644
This isn't a discussion. Do it.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.652
Walter, I'm doing your surgery.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.320
-There isn't anyone else?
-I'm sorry.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.322
Because of the accident
on the H-1, there isn't.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.574
But don't worry.
I've done a ton of these. Look at me.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.245
-I got you.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.173
When's the Chief of Staff getting here?

07:04.882 --> 07:05.842
-I don't know.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.093
He's 40 minutes late.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.346
I'm a doctor,
not an Uber driver circling the airport.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.347
I know.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.767
I'm trying to get to my son's school
by four for his Greek Gods show.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.602
Oh, I don't need your life history.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.646
I was just wondering where Dr. Choi was.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.898
-Ah.

07:20.982 --> 07:24.318
Sorry I'm late, people.
I was talking to Magic Johnson.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.407
You got off the phone with Magic
to come to a staff meeting?

07:29.490 --> 07:30.825
When I grow up, I wanna be you.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.118
Well, I had to thank him

07:32.201 --> 07:34.370
because he sent me
this box of frozen steaks.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.415
An NBA legend knows
your home address. That's dope.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.750
Is it? I guess I never
really thought about it like that

07:39.834 --> 07:41.002
because we're such good friends.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.087
Now, unfortunately, I can't eat them

07:43.171 --> 07:46.549
because I am doing a red meat fast
with Bruno Mars' hat guy.

07:46.632 --> 07:51.262
-Bruno Mars is Honolulu royalty. Respect.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.098
You get a steak! You get a steak!

07:54.182 --> 07:56.809
-You get a steak! You get a steak!

07:56.893 --> 08:00.563
-Do you mind if I...
-Yes, Clara! Everyone gets a steak!

08:00.646 --> 08:02.231
-Ah, New York strip?

08:02.857 --> 08:04.150
Um...

08:04.233 --> 08:05.234
What's up?

08:05.318 --> 08:08.863
-Oh. Presentation. Yes. Go, go, go.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.745
-Okay, hospital... Okay.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.539
Hospital efficiency.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.876
How we use or misuse our time is...

08:28.382 --> 08:29.967
I am so sorry.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.720
I was just thinking
about this video Magic sent me.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.348
It's of this guy in sunglasses
flipping his speedboat

08:35.431 --> 08:36.807
to <i>Turn Down For What.</i>

08:38.476 --> 08:41.354
Oh, we should watch it.
You know, I'm sorry. No, no, no.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.314
No, no. Well, yeah. Well, let's watch it.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.649
-Yeah? All right.
-DR.Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.983
-Yeah.
-DR.Let's watch it.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.945
I can't think of a better way
of spending a seminar on efficiency

08:49.028 --> 08:51.113
than watching a seven-year-old
YouTube video.

08:52.114 --> 08:55.076
Lots of Nordstrom tabs open.
Just go for it, girl!

08:55.159 --> 08:57.119
Take a chance,
you know they got great returns!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.913
-Okay, check this out.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.001
-Oh! Right? Am I right?

09:05.294 --> 09:08.256
-Hey, you guys wanna spy on my dog?

09:08.839 --> 09:11.133
-Aloha.
-Hey, Walter.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.177
How you feeling
since you got your appendix out?

09:13.886 --> 09:17.098
It's so good to see you,
right here in the flesh.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.975
Sorry. Do I know you, guys?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.935
-Oh, my God, you're so funny.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.855
Wait, do you really not know who we are?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.733
It's us, Noelani and Charles.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.777
No-no and Chuckles?

09:30.361 --> 09:32.822
Noels? Charlani?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.659
-Lahela must have talked about us.
-Yeah.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.745
We're like her mentor
slash best friends slash stylist

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123
slash the wind beneath her wings.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.958
Oh. Hey, guys.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.126
What the heck, Lahela?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.087
Walter doesn't even know who we are
and we know everything about him?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.505
I know he wrote his English paper

09:49.589 --> 09:51.007
on "The Eyes of T.J. Eckleburg"
in<i> The Great Gatsby.</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:53.759
And I was the one that likes
every one of his Instagram posts!

09:53.843 --> 09:54.760
I mean, I went deep.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.804
I was the one to tell you
he had a Cocker Spaniel!

09:56.887 --> 09:59.557
I’m sorry. Is the multi-car pile-up
all sorted then?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.059
Yeah, it could use some tidying up.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.312
-We should probably go.
-Hmm.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.688
Manolo.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.733
Sorry about that. I brought you something.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.611
"It's a boy"?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.654
Yeah, slim pickings
at the hospital gift shop.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.741
It was that
or the "World's Best Grandpa" mug, so...

10:17.408 --> 10:18.743
-Thanks.
-How you feeling?

10:19.869 --> 10:20.703
Okay.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.164
On a scale of one to ten,
what would you rate your pain level?

10:23.247 --> 10:24.624
I'll let you in on a little secret.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.960
My male patients usually respond
with six no matter how bad it is,

10:28.044 --> 10:31.422
because they think six says
"I'm in pain, but I'm a macho man."

10:31.505 --> 10:34.175
Feel free to tell me your real number.
It'll be our secret.

10:35.092 --> 10:35.926
Six.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.721
Cool.

10:40.389 --> 10:44.268
Well, if you want, I can grab a wheelchair
and bring you to the courtyard.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.896
The art there is hideous.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.398
They have this statue
that looks like a giant butt.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.568
I'm good.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.570
You sure?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.989
It's where I go when I've had
a rough day and need a cheap...

10:57.073 --> 10:58.407
I'm watching this.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.329
Oh, okay.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.955
But you don't know what you're missing.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.709
If you sit just right, it looks like
the people are walking out of the butt.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.601
Come on, come on, come on...

11:27.853 --> 11:28.938
Damn it.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.108
-Hey, honey!

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
-Hey.
-You missed a great show!

11:33.901 --> 11:36.779
Except the art teacher wore
a very revealing toga for no reason.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.490
I could have made it,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.826
but Dr. Choi ate into my presentation time

11:41.909 --> 11:44.370
with a story about Magic Johnson
and a sand trap.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.873
I had to shorten my efficiency lecture
to be efficient.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.418
Turned into an irony lecture.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.504
Wait, your boss knows Magic Johnson?

11:54.171 --> 11:55.047
That's rad!

11:55.131 --> 11:58.718
Yeah. Except there's no way
he really knows Magic Johnson.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.846
I've heard him tell
that exact same golf story before,

12:01.929 --> 12:05.391
but last time, he was with
Don Ho's old tour manager.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.227
Wait a minute, your boss knows
Don Ho's old tour manager?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.979
-Mom!
-Oh.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.188
You made it!

12:11.272 --> 12:12.690
Everybody loved your rock,

12:12.773 --> 12:14.984
especially when it got loose
and took out Achilles.

12:16.736 --> 12:21.198
I'm sorry I missed your show, baby.
I… I got caught up at work.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.158
That's okay.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.035
I knew it was a long shot.
I wasn't counting on it.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
Oh, you weren't?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.708
Because I really wanted to be there.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.794
Yeah, but we know
you can't really be there. That's cool.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.547
Like last week when I scored that goal
at the Aloha Invitational.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.090
You scored a goal?

12:38.174 --> 12:39.967
Yeah. It was a header off a corner.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.761
But that's okay. You're busy.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.430
-Yeah, your job's important.
-See? They get it.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.947
Hey, have you heard from Walter today?

13:02.031 --> 13:03.741
Yeah, we texted earlier. Why?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.451
No reason.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.995
-Sorry.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.539
Guys, can I have everyone's attention?

13:10.706 --> 13:11.999
Is this about earlier?

13:12.082 --> 13:13.793
I told you my chair made that sound.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.924
I've been a doctor for 15 years,

13:20.007 --> 13:22.593
sacrificed everything for the hospital.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.222
And while I'm comfortable
with the demands of my job,

13:27.306 --> 13:30.184
I have come to realize,
it's not fair to you guys.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.270
I've missed too many important milestones.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.316
So, I called Dr. Choi and told him,

13:37.399 --> 13:39.777
I'm scaling back my hours to part-time,

13:40.444 --> 13:44.240
-so I can be the best mom that I can be.
-Wow.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.991
-Awesome.
-That's great.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.451
-Yeah? Good?
-Yeah.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.706
Besides, as long as Dr. Choi is chief,

13:52.790 --> 13:55.918
none of the improvements
I wanna make are going to happen.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.046
So I'd rather be here with you guys

13:59.129 --> 14:01.048
and make an actual difference.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.216
That's a big life change.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.384
Yeah.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.385
Are you sure, honey?

14:04.468 --> 14:08.097
I've never been more sure
of anything in my whole life.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.892
Other than the fact
that chairs don't make that sound.

14:22.361 --> 14:26.866
So, I'm home all day today, no work,
no charts, no presentations,

14:26.949 --> 14:28.450
just you and me, buddy.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.952
Hey, Mom, can you move?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.787
I die less when I can see the screen.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.250
Well, I was really hoping
to spend some time with you.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.543
You know what?

14:38.335 --> 14:40.170
Ugh. Hand me a controller!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.047
I'll get it.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.550
So what are we working with?

14:44.633 --> 14:48.429
Uh, Plumbers? Hedgehogs? Zeldas?

14:48.512 --> 14:50.764
Mom, my friends online can hear you.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.267
-And they get weird around women.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.184
Oh.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.979
So what's the goal?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.188
How do you win?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.524
Just wanted to explore the world,

15:00.608 --> 15:01.859
wander around.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.569
Maybe make a pot of stew.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.280
Oh, and that's fun?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.698
It used to be.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.242
Oh, get the poi! Get the poi!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.077
That makes a hearty stew.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.079
Hey, Walter.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.624
I know it's super weird
to be leaving you a voicemail.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.376
What am I, an '80s businessman?

15:20.127 --> 15:24.423
Anyway, I haven't talked to you
since you left the hospital,

15:24.506 --> 15:29.053
and I thought maybe the sound of my voice
would compel you to hit me back.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.516
Still not on main?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.476
No.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.812
I mean, patients who are complete
strangers have put me on main.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.564
Rip Tide put me in his will.

15:41.065 --> 15:45.027
Ever since I did that appy,
Walter and I have gone from DTR to DOA.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.029
He's probably just weirded out
by your genius.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.990
I mean, you did surgery on him.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.285
Most kids and even adults
are intimidated by your big brain.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.871
Four people for mini-golf
with bumper boats,

15:55.955 --> 15:59.875
plus ten dollars in tokens,
three sodas, a Yoo-hoo, and a poke,

15:59.959 --> 16:02.419
-that'll be...
-Ninety-one dollars and fifty-two cents.

16:03.921 --> 16:04.838
With tax.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.969
<i>"Phrase" is the category
and now you can spin.</i>

16:14.932 --> 16:16.433
Rome wasn't built in a day.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.061
<i>That's it. Quite a nice try.
Let's now, cash in.</i>

16:19.144 --> 16:20.688
-- <i>"R"?</i>
-- <i>One "R".</i>

16:24.566 --> 16:26.902
Hot tip, never fold a King-Jack suit.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.445
You had a 63 percent chance

16:28.529 --> 16:30.114
-of beating me on the river.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.199
And the brontosaurus on your shirt
is inaccurate.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.576
Sauropods only had one claw
on their forearms.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.120
-Could you spot me a...
-Charles,

16:36.203 --> 16:38.706
she already took your Seiko
and the keys to your Lancia.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.124
I think you should go home.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.543
All right.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.378
Thank you.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.590
Am I extra?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.969
We're both extra,
which is why I'm not intimidated by you.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.432
You've got your high IQ,
and I've got my <i>joie de vivre</i>.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.852
But Walter is just Walter.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.938
He's fine but,
you're the star of that relationship.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.565
He's...

17:05.441 --> 17:06.900
Robin to your Batman.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.777
And I think it might be nice

17:08.861 --> 17:13.240
if every once in a while,
you let him catch the Joker.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.243
Well, how do I do that? He's avoiding me.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.162
Do I have to solve
all your problems for you?

17:18.245 --> 17:19.121
Mm-hmm.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.873
So much emotional labor.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.082
-Mm.

17:22.666 --> 17:26.170
Okay, so when we go
to the escape room on Friday,

17:26.628 --> 17:28.172
maybe tone it down a notch.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.050
You don't always have to prove
you're the smartest person in the room.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.553
Give him a win.
That should get you on main.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.181
I love it. I'm in.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.724
That was too easy.

17:39.683 --> 17:40.893
If I'm on a roll,

17:40.976 --> 17:43.520
I should go talk to my mom
about getting my belly button pierced.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.861
This is what I wanted to do
with the surgical supply room years ago.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.113
But Dr. Choi thought
it was a waste of time.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.032
Cool. Can you hand me the vanilla?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.743
Kai! The kitchen's a mess!

17:57.826 --> 17:59.411
Well, no not the whole kitchen.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.163
-The pantry looks good.
-Oh.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.041
Do you need all this stuff
for your cookie pie?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.375
Let me see the recipe.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.003
Don't have one.
See, I like to bake by feel.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.339
The pie tells me what it wants to be.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.466
How about salmonella-free?

18:12.549 --> 18:14.510
Has the pie mentioned anything about that?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.595
You need a better method.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.638
-Oh.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.264
Hey, honey.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.058
Maybe give Kai some room to make his pie.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.477
I know the kids are loving
having you home,

18:23.560 --> 18:25.604
but you don't have
to look after them 24-7.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.649
Why don't you take some time for yourself?

18:28.732 --> 18:30.609
-Really?
-Yeah, you deserve it.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.653
You're right.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.489
I do deserve some me time.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.909
I'm gonna go reroof the pagoda.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.494
Okay. Ever since Mom's been home,

18:40.577 --> 18:43.705
she's been putting all this weird
overachiever energy into us.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
She's messing with my baking time.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.085
-Pie time is Kai time.
-Don't worry.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.753
She'll be on that roof for days.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.298
-Your old man's a mastermind.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.177
So, cookie pie. It's one word.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.731
Hi!

19:10.023 --> 19:12.317
I've been working so hard to help the kids

19:12.401 --> 19:17.906
and I realized I've been
totally neglecting my number one guy.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.741
So, I'm here to help.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.494
Great.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.454
Great.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.046
So glad you felt well enough to come.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.008
By the way, I never got to tell you,

19:36.091 --> 19:40.179
but I used subcuticular stitches,
so they won't have to be taken out.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.763
Ah, thanks.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.851
Take it easy, Batman.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.937
Welcome to Escape from Paradise!

19:49.021 --> 19:54.234
Oahu's number one escape room attraction
in this mini-mall.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.488
I am Douglas Von Der Ahe,
world-famous explorer.

19:58.572 --> 20:03.035
I'll be your guide
to a fantastical adventure into your mind.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.246
Which one of you has the Groupon?

20:11.126 --> 20:12.252
Valid.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.882
Your coterie will be joined
by this intrepid couple from the mainland.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.550
We're the Jamies.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.303
I'm Jamie with an "I"
and this is Jamey with a "Y".

20:21.386 --> 20:24.514
Super excited to be in Hawaii.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.019
It's always been Jamie's dream
to visit a foreign country.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.145
-Oh...
-Leave it.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.819
You are a team of geologists
trapped in this cave.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.740
You have 60 minutes to escape
before the volcano erupts,

20:41.823 --> 20:46.453
flooding the chamber
with red hot magma lava.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.372
Magma lava isn't a thing.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.040
It's either magma or lava.

20:50.123 --> 20:53.377
-Ow.
-Time starts now.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.089
The first step is
to unlock a black light pen

20:57.172 --> 20:59.675
by solving the word scramble on the wall.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.470
Hello and goodbye.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.019
I got it.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.313
Halo.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.109
Uh, what about the other "A"?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.028
Well, good point.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.030
"A halo."

21:24.700 --> 21:27.661
Jamie guessed three
of the masked singers last season.

21:27.744 --> 21:28.620
Oh.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.038
That's awesome.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.876
So, every day, you change
the name of your shave ice flavors?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.628
Uh, based on the day's theme.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.588
Today, I'm doing Mel Brooks movies.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.883
Doesn't that make the menu
confusing for your customers?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.802
No, they love it. It's fun.

21:43.885 --> 21:44.886
DR.Hey, Benny.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.346
Hey, aloha, Dr. Choi!

21:46.847 --> 21:50.642
Uh, I will take a Gene Wilder-Berry.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.769
Now, is that strawberry or blueberry?

21:52.853 --> 21:53.770
You know what?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.148
Don't tell me, it'll be a surprise.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.107
This is fun.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.320
I, uh, hope they have good shave ice
in LA. I'm gonna miss this.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.696
-Oh, you're leaving?
-Oh.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.490
Yeah. I just got an offer to be a doctor
for a major sports team

22:05.574 --> 22:08.118
I'm not allowed to disclose.
It's the Lakers!

22:08.201 --> 22:11.163
-Huh? Oh.
-It's the Los Angeles Lakers!

22:11.246 --> 22:13.165
Great. Awesome. Congratulations.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.168
Thank you. Yeah, the only bummer is
I need to find my replacement.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.545
Yeah, too bad you've got your kids,
you'd be great.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.089
But you got your hands full
doing your mom thing.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.007
Wait, what?

22:22.090 --> 22:23.133
Oh, you know what I mean.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.802
I mean, you're awesome and everything,
but you wanted to step back.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.472
-One Gene Wilder-Berry.
-Oh.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.641
The lilikoi on top
honors his signature auburn curls.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.604
I gotta send a pic
of this to Magic Johnson.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.148
We do this fun thing
where I send him pictures of food,

22:38.231 --> 22:40.942
and he sends me pictures of rashes
he wants me to check out.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.903
-Oh.
-It's disgusting.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.573
He doesn't know Magic Johnson.

22:46.656 --> 22:47.866
Why are you so mad?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.202
Is this about the Chief of Staff job?

22:50.285 --> 22:52.037
-No.
-Hmm.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.123
You always talk about what you would do
with the hospital if Dr. Choi left.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.877
-You're not intrigued?
-Of course, I am.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.213
It's the job I've wanted for ever.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.173
But it means working more.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.093
And I already feel bad
about how much I work now.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.097
I don't know, I'm so torn.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.265
What do I do?

23:12.933 --> 23:13.975
It's a big decision.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.187
There's only one thing to do.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.615
Any idea how this works?

24:11.199 --> 24:14.161
Well, there are playing cards
on each of the pads,

24:14.244 --> 24:16.705
patterns probably a poker hand, so...

24:18.623 --> 24:20.417
You know, what, uh, what do you think?

24:20.500 --> 24:21.960
I don't know.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.296
Come on, team.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.007
You got this. We can do it.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.717
We think this might be a clue.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.552
-We found it hanging on the wall.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.221
That is an actual fire extinguisher.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.726
Puzzles are hard.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.900
-We're never gonna get this.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.361
I'm starting to think the word jumble
at the beginning wasn't "aloha".

24:48.987 --> 24:51.406
Maybe it was "a halo".

24:51.490 --> 24:52.407
"A halo"?

24:52.491 --> 24:53.992
In what world does that make sense?

24:54.075 --> 24:58.163
It's "aloha", we're in Hawaii,
which, FYI, is in America!

25:15.764 --> 25:18.308
I'm sorry, Walter, I just can't do this.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.685
I'm Batman. Deal with it.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.316
Guess she didn't wanna
get killed by the magma lava.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.651
Not a thing!

25:29.027 --> 25:30.237
Whoo!

25:30.987 --> 25:33.907
-Told you that would help.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.158
So let's talk.

25:37.494 --> 25:41.414
I know I could do
a kick-ass job as Chief of Staff,

25:41.498 --> 25:43.583
but the kids matter most.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.837
I don't want them to look back
and think I was never around.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.632
No question.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.509
I'm not going for the job.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.429
-That makes sense.
-Of course, you say that.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.639
You're a dad,

25:57.722 --> 26:00.559
so anything you do
for the kids is, like, extra credit.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.354
But for moms?
It's totally different. It's not fair.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.649
I'm finally at the point in my career

26:07.732 --> 26:12.445
where I could make that hospital run
the way I know it should be run.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.948
So... go for the job.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.825
Because you want me out of the house?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.911
I've never told you where you have to be.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.873
That's why your surprise party
last year was such a flop.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.043
Yeah, it was.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.843
What's wrong, kiddo?

26:35.385 --> 26:36.553
Nothing.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.265
-Why do you think something's wrong?
-A mom always knows.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.268
Plus, this is where you come
when you've had a bad day.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.020
What's up?

26:46.396 --> 26:52.902
Life would just be so much easier
if I wasn't Lahela Kamealoha, girl genius.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.449
You have a special gift.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.743
It's a good thing.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.953
Even if it makes me extra?

27:02.037 --> 27:03.455
Oh.

27:04.372 --> 27:08.209
If the world can't deal
with a strong, smart woman...

27:09.628 --> 27:12.964
that's the world's problem, not yours.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.759
Always be true to who you are.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.889
You can't hide from your true self,

27:22.265 --> 27:23.808
and you shouldn't have to.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.733
That's why I'm going for Chief of Staff.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.735
You are?

27:33.818 --> 27:35.820
-Yeah.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.863
I am.

27:37.530 --> 27:41.701
Being a great mom means living your life
as an example for your kids.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.538
I can't tell you to be you
if I'm not being me.

27:45.622 --> 27:49.459
We, we are strong, smart ladies, Lahela,

27:49.542 --> 27:51.795
and we don't have to apologize for that.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.464
-You're right.
-Right?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.929
Hey, does that statue look like a butt?

28:01.012 --> 28:05.266
Yes, and no matter where you stand,
it's always looking at you.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.233
So, what's Bruno Mars' hat guy like?

28:13.316 --> 28:14.984
Uh, you know, he's all right.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.862
He's kind of a hanger-on
name-dropper type.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.364
Sad, really.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.825
-Wow.
-I wanna be considered for Chief of Staff.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.868
No one knows this hospital better than me.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.537
No one works harder.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.416
Earlier, you said
I had my hands full being a mom.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.334
Being a mom is a strength.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.837
This hospital needs a mom.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.050
Great. Consider yourself in the running.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.636
-MAGIC <i>She's got my vote.</i>

28:41.720 --> 28:43.221
Oh, yeah. It, uh...

28:44.639 --> 28:46.433
Oh, my God! Magic Johnson.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.561
Hi, you're... he's...
you're Magic Johnson!

28:49.644 --> 28:50.854
<i>Last time I checked.</i>

28:50.937 --> 28:53.732
Wow. I am a huge fan.

28:53.815 --> 28:57.152
I mean, I'm from Philly,
so you know, Sixers.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.653
<i>Well, nobody's perfect.</i>

29:00.864 --> 29:02.699
Ah, hi, uh, Mr. Magic!

29:02.782 --> 29:06.202
Uh, I like golf and steaks,
uh, you like golf and steak.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.121
Maybe we should get together
sometime and I...

29:08.204 --> 29:12.125
<i>Man, that sounds like fun.
I'll give you my private cellphone number.</i>

29:12.208 --> 29:13.710
-Wow.
<i>-It's 3-1-0...</i>

29:13.793 --> 29:16.254
-Sorry...
-Not, not that. It's fine.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.797
-Uh...
-Oh.

29:17.881 --> 29:21.384
Uh, 3-1-0, yeah?

29:21.468 --> 29:24.345
3-1-0, what? 3-1-0, what?

29:24.929 --> 29:27.098
Uh, uh, Magic, Magic...

29:27.182 --> 29:30.518
Uh, I think you froze.
Magic! Magic! Magic!

29:30.602 --> 29:33.480
Sorry, eh, the Wi-Fi stinks.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.689
What?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.524
<i>That was close. Did he buy it?</i>

29:41.321 --> 29:42.655
He's still in the room.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.580
Just keep acting frozen.
I'm, I'm also gonna act frozen.

30:04.552 --> 30:05.595
What are you doing here?

30:05.678 --> 30:07.722
-I need to talk to you.
-I need to talk to you.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.850
Is something wrong?
Why did you run out of the escape room?

30:10.934 --> 30:14.103
Look, I get that
I intimidate a lot of people,

30:14.187 --> 30:16.898
but I'm smart,
and I shouldn't have to hide that.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.108
And if that makes me
a big old weirdy weirdo

30:19.192 --> 30:21.945
or too extra for you,
then that's your problem.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.196
-And I just...
-Whoa, whoa.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.824
I like you because you're smart.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.033
You do?

30:27.116 --> 30:29.494
Yes. I love that you're a doctor.

30:29.619 --> 30:32.163
You're the smartest person I know.
It's awesome.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.500
Then why have you been acting so strange?

30:36.084 --> 30:36.918
I don't know.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.963
Maybe because you saw me
like that at mini-golf.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.799
Laid out on the ground, helpless.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.843
It was embarrassing.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.177
And then after the surgery,

30:46.261 --> 30:49.806
you just walked into my room
with a balloon like it was no big deal.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.350
Felt like an idiot.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.853
Well, you needed an appy.
It wasn't a big deal.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.355
For you to cut me open
and have to take care of me...

30:58.982 --> 31:00.191
Made me feel weird.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.694
Well, I've done that procedure
on dozens of patients.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.696
Never done it on me.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.619
You're right.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.581
I'm sorry.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.417
You're not just any patient.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.919
Well, yeah, I'd hope not.
I mean, I'm your boyfriend.

31:20.837 --> 31:21.754
Boyfriend?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.758
Oh, God. Um, is it too soon to DTR?

31:26.801 --> 31:29.345
Not at all... boyfriend.

31:33.892 --> 31:38.646
Being a 16-year-old doctor
is kind of like having a superpower.

31:39.355 --> 31:42.692
But sometimes, when there are things
that make you different,

31:42.775 --> 31:47.071
you worry you won't fit in,
and you hide your true talents.

31:47.655 --> 31:51.701
But I realized I don't wanna be Batman.

31:52.368 --> 31:56.497
I'd rather take off my mask
and show the world who I really am.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.666
Oh, and in case you were wondering...

32:01.461 --> 32:02.712
I'm on main.
