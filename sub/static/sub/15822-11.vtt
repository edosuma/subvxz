00:08.717 --> 00:11.177
Synchro: Kiry, ShalimarFox

00:16.140 --> 00:19.685
- Oh, Ma, please don't cry.
- I can't help it, Brenda Leigh.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.696
Who designed this veil...

00:30.864 --> 00:31.914
The Taliban?

00:34.976 --> 00:36.497
Let's try another one.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.756
Almost done.

00:48.768 --> 00:51.967
I have never seen anyone
so beautiful

00:52.136 --> 00:54.637
- in my whole life.
- I have, Willie Ray.

00:55.629 --> 00:58.414
When you walked down the aisle
wearing that dress.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.538
Now I need a tissue.

01:11.403 --> 01:15.116
I'm just sorry you have to wait a month
to see Brenda in that beautiful dress.

01:15.926 --> 01:18.577
Well, technically,
it's only 28 days.

01:19.109 --> 01:21.455
But I bet we'd both feel better
if we had that in writing.

01:21.937 --> 01:23.329
Think of yourself

01:23.860 --> 01:25.751
Half a century hence,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.936
When you and Brenda could be doing

01:28.061 --> 01:30.297
what Willie Ray and I
are doing right now,

01:30.748 --> 01:34.014
Getting ready to celebrate
your 50th anniversary

01:34.365 --> 01:36.719
on a cruise of the Hawaiian Islands.

01:38.654 --> 01:40.558
I can almost smell the sea breeze.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.392
Yeah, but why should I be
wearing white, Ma?

01:45.517 --> 01:47.177
- It's not like I'm...
- Brenda Leigh,

01:47.302 --> 01:50.693
White is the color of joy
and new beginnings.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.701
Well, I should just...
You'd have to do work on this, Mama.

01:53.826 --> 01:56.228
I should just wear the gown
From my first wedding.

01:56.353 --> 01:59.053
You can't re-wear that dress.
That's cursed!

01:59.178 --> 02:01.201
Besides, your father and I
like to pretend

02:01.326 --> 02:03.632
that first marriage never happened.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.627
Now stand up, and turn around.

02:12.195 --> 02:14.133
So, which is it gonna be?

02:14.482 --> 02:16.477
Your sister-in-law Amy's...

02:17.008 --> 02:19.563
your aunt Ruth's... or...

02:19.848 --> 02:20.848
mine?

02:25.455 --> 02:27.354
Well, I like yours the best.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.366
- Of course she does.
- That's the only right answer

02:30.491 --> 02:32.161
with me standing next to her.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.846
Still, I'm glad she said it anyway.

02:39.282 --> 02:41.683
- No! No!
- I'm not looking.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.416
It's lieutenant Flynn.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.497
Thank you.

02:48.985 --> 02:50.090
Yes? Hello?

02:50.545 --> 02:51.545
Yes.

02:52.845 --> 02:55.835
I hope we find a proper place
for y'all to get married

02:55.960 --> 02:57.760
Before we have to get on that ship.

02:58.084 --> 03:01.972
Brenda Leigh always lets things slide
until the very last minute.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.452
I wish she'd take more
of an interest in all this.

03:04.577 --> 03:06.545
Oh, she's very interested,
Willie Ray.

03:06.670 --> 03:10.636
For example, look at how hard
she's been searching for the right cake.

03:11.141 --> 03:12.786
If that girl had her way,

03:12.911 --> 03:15.569
she'd ask a minister
to stop by a crime scene

03:15.694 --> 03:18.426
and then serve ho hos
out of her purse.

03:18.551 --> 03:21.742
I hope she's not headed for
one of those horrible murders.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.203
We have so many places
we have to see.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.014
No, Ma, I'm stopping by the office
for a quick celebration,

03:27.139 --> 03:29.181
Which I said might be
happening today,

03:29.306 --> 03:31.710
And to sign off
on a suicide that just came in.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.586
And then I will be joing you

03:33.756 --> 03:36.477
For our tour of very small chapels.

03:36.602 --> 03:38.342
Tiny, tiny. I mean it.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.674
And I'm sorry I can't come
with you today, but I promise,

03:40.799 --> 03:43.178
I'm gonna hook up
with all of you right after work.

03:43.303 --> 03:47.017
I thought we were gonna pick out a cake
before we left this morning.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.658
Julio.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.260
<i>I have a long day.</i>

04:16.214 --> 04:18.458
- Sure?
- No, positive. Thanks.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.444
Oh, my God, open your card.

04:22.899 --> 04:25.656
But why light duty? I've spent
a great deal of time with him.

04:25.781 --> 04:27.808
Detective Sanchez
seems fully recovered to me.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.520
The guy's had 5 surgeries and a shoulder
reconstructed from cadaver parts.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.385
All it takes is one doctor
to say, "he's not ready yet."

04:34.510 --> 04:36.472
I took him to the firing range
3 days ago,

04:36.597 --> 04:39.528
and he still ranks a sharpshooter,
and I saw him run 1/2 mile at the track.

04:40.061 --> 04:42.752
Look, lieutenant Provenza
is his immediate supervisor.

04:42.877 --> 04:45.075
He should have all the paperwork,
ask him what's up.

04:45.379 --> 04:47.453
Meanwhile, two patrol officers

04:47.621 --> 04:51.110
from the Hollywood division
wrote up a suicide last Sunday.

04:51.235 --> 04:54.710
Morales calls back from the morgue,
and says the guy was murdered.

04:55.315 --> 04:57.338
Hollywood homicide detectives
didn't follow up?

04:57.983 --> 05:00.507
Did you not hear the words
"suicide" and "Sunday"?

05:01.555 --> 05:02.577
Lovely.

05:02.967 --> 05:06.239
So, the good doctor is offering
the case to major crimes

05:06.364 --> 05:10.139
Before filing a complaint with the D.A.,
which could trigger an inquiry which...

05:10.540 --> 05:12.969
chief Pope does not need right now.

05:19.672 --> 05:22.446
So, Dr. Morales, I understand
you have something to show us.

05:22.744 --> 05:23.744
I do.

05:24.134 --> 05:25.950
Then would someone
kill the lights, please?

05:26.118 --> 05:27.993
Yeah.
I got it, chief.

05:28.345 --> 05:30.527
You guys, maybe you want
to put down your little...

05:30.652 --> 05:33.958
Wedding-cake samples
while I show you my presentation.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.335
- It's pretty graphic.
- No, we're fine, doc.

05:36.663 --> 05:39.304
In fact, this is a really good test
to see which one of these

05:39.429 --> 05:41.149
the chief might choose
for her reception.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.937
Yeah, If you still like it

05:43.062 --> 05:45.344
while you're watching somebody
who blew their brains out,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.692
This is the cake for your wedding.

05:47.817 --> 05:51.433
But this guy didn't blow his brains out.
That was done for him.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.810
This is a murder.

05:53.277 --> 05:57.228
Jeffrey Crawford, white male,
36 years old, building contractor.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.452
Who discovered the body?

06:00.830 --> 06:02.569
That would be his minister.

06:02.869 --> 06:05.739
Pastor Paul Hicks.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.139
According to the responding officers,
the minister identified himself as a...

06:09.264 --> 06:11.273
"close friend of the victim",
Jeff Crawford.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.405
Is there any reason to believe

06:13.936 --> 06:16.250
Mr. Crawford would want
to off himself?

06:16.597 --> 06:18.419
Hesitation marks on his wrists.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.796
From an old suicide attempt.

06:21.157 --> 06:22.965
I'm not investigating his past.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.926
Mr. Crawford also owed
a substantial sum to his brother,

06:26.094 --> 06:28.021
With whom he owned
a contracting business,

06:28.146 --> 06:31.544
and his ex-wife is suing him
for back alimony and child support.

06:31.669 --> 06:35.667
Plus, he just got out of rehab
for cocaine addiction six months ago.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.701
Other than that, life was good.

06:39.988 --> 06:42.387
I don't care
what his personal life was like.

06:42.512 --> 06:44.843
I'm interested
in the physical evidence.

06:44.968 --> 06:48.490
We do an X-Ray series of every victim
that comes to the coroner's office.

06:49.896 --> 06:52.539
As you can see, the first
and second joints

06:52.664 --> 06:55.676
of his index and middle fingers
on his right hand

06:55.801 --> 06:58.792
are fused from an old injury.
They... they don't bend.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.045
And he was shot through
the right side of his head.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.922
Which means that he'd have had to use
his ring finger to pull the trigger.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.787
Considering how awkwardly
the gun would have to be held

07:06.912 --> 07:09.928
to go from right to left,
back to front.

07:10.225 --> 07:12.014
Even if it could be done,
I don't believe it

07:12.182 --> 07:14.547
and I'm not signing off on suicide.

07:14.912 --> 07:18.064
So... I'm going over
Hollywood division's head.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.415
- If the L.A.P.D. won't follow up...
- Whoa, hold on a second, doc.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.503
- I don't think I like your tone, okay?
- Really?

07:23.628 --> 07:25.281
- Really.
- How about a dial tone?

07:25.406 --> 07:28.288
'Cause that's what you'll get next time
you call for an expedited autopsy.

07:28.413 --> 07:31.493
Now might be a really great time
for everyone here to remind themselves.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.703
I don't work for you.
I work for the County,

07:34.871 --> 07:37.956
And I have a legal obligation
to determine how this man died.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.877
Now, if you won't take this seriously,
I have no trouble going elsewhere.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.545
Enjoy your cake.

07:44.406 --> 07:48.396
Doctor! Please. One moment, please.
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.376
Lt Provenza, could you call
the victim's brother, please?

07:51.501 --> 07:54.174
We should try and meet with him as soon
as possible. And, cdr. Taylor,

07:54.299 --> 07:57.112
since there's a minister involved, would
you go through the necessary channels

07:57.237 --> 07:59.436
for me to speak with him, please?
And, detective Sanchez,

07:59.604 --> 08:02.728
let's go through everything that the
S.I.D. collected from the crime scene.

08:02.853 --> 08:06.151
Chief, I've been looking at the pictures
they took, and the doc. might be right.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.818
This is the bathroom
where the body was found.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.063
Look at the blow-back.
It's not uniform.

08:12.188 --> 08:16.163
There's a bloody silhouette on the door,
maybe where the shooter was standing.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.222
I'll get to the bottom of this.
I promise.

08:29.347 --> 08:32.010
Just... take this seriously.
Please.

08:32.298 --> 08:33.386
Absolutely.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.056
Welcome back, Detective.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.102
- You want my opinion, Chief?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.898
I was surprised, but I liked
the lemon cream. It held up.

08:46.362 --> 08:47.969
Thank you, lieutenant.

08:48.755 --> 08:50.837
I'll make sure and tell my mom.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.916
<i>Did your brother call you
that Sunday morning,</i>

09:01.041 --> 09:03.167
<i>and tell you that he was
feeling down and depressed?</i>

09:03.878 --> 09:05.858
And did he give you
a ny indication that...

09:05.983 --> 09:08.294
Captain Joiner called me
from Hollywood division

09:08.419 --> 09:10.247
and tells me we're about
to incur a lawsuit.

09:10.372 --> 09:12.655
- Is that right?
- A lawsuit? Over what?

09:12.780 --> 09:16.113
Well, did we tell the family and friends
of some drug addict

09:16.238 --> 09:19.391
that he killed himself, and then start
investigating it as a murder?

09:19.716 --> 09:22.477
I'm sorry, sir, but the morgue decided
that the death was undetermined,

09:22.920 --> 09:25.365
So rather than put Dr. Morales
on a collision course with...

09:25.490 --> 09:26.925
OK, listen, first,

09:27.050 --> 09:29.530
we don't investigate suicides.
That's number one.

09:29.655 --> 09:31.469
- Second...
- Second, it's not a suicide.

09:31.594 --> 09:33.572
It's undetermined.
So what should I do?

09:33.740 --> 09:36.742
- Yes, detective Daniels?
- It turns out Ed here

09:36.910 --> 09:39.494
wasn't just our victim's brother
and business partner.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.123
He's also sole heir
to Jeff Crawford's will. And...

09:43.291 --> 09:47.044
Jeff had a really expensive
insurance policy just vested recently.

09:47.343 --> 09:48.889
$2 million payoff,

09:49.152 --> 09:50.839
And the only beneficiary...

09:51.007 --> 09:53.391
- His brother!
- I thought Jeff had kids.

09:53.516 --> 09:55.802
And now they have a rich uncle.
One more thing...

09:55.970 --> 09:58.639
The weapon found at the scene
that Jeff used to blow his brains out

09:58.807 --> 10:00.145
belongs to Ed here.

10:00.270 --> 10:03.452
Are we now turning
all these mourners into suspects?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.605
I promise that I will investigate
this murder discreetly.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.566
Oh, my God! You just called it a murder.
That is not discreet.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.587
As your concerns, I just...

10:11.918 --> 10:14.345
I just have to do
one thing first, okay?

10:14.470 --> 10:15.527
Thank you.

10:17.996 --> 10:21.119
<i>Jeff joined this church
after he got out of rehab.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.330
<i>He told me he had given
his life to Christ.</i>

10:23.499 --> 10:25.799
And he became close
with his minister.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.459
And he started dating...

10:27.628 --> 10:29.428
Almost got engaged, I guess,

10:29.553 --> 10:32.478
to this sweet girl Beth
on chemo for lymphoma.

10:32.908 --> 10:36.026
Maybe it was her saying no
to being married

10:36.151 --> 10:38.262
that pushed him over the edge.
I don't know.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.631
I- I don't know.

10:39.756 --> 10:41.639
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.931
Please don't be mad at me, sirs.

10:45.682 --> 10:48.259
Y'all want to keep going,
or should I...

10:48.589 --> 10:49.815
Xhat is it now?

10:50.469 --> 10:52.776
I forgot to have Mr. Crawford here

10:54.386 --> 10:57.591
sign the Miranda waiver.
I'm so sorry.

10:58.940 --> 11:01.644
Well, just hurry it up.
Let's go. Come on.

11:02.519 --> 11:06.124
If you could just initial
the marked areas

11:06.249 --> 11:08.874
explaining that you don't have
to talk to us, and that you...

11:08.999 --> 11:10.818
you know, you have
the right to an attorney.

11:10.943 --> 11:13.369
- The usual rigmarole.
- Okay.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.135
So, you paid your brother
even though he didn't come into work?

11:18.303 --> 11:19.789
I would have bought Jeff out,

11:19.914 --> 11:22.441
but by the time I discovered
how much money he had borrowed

11:22.566 --> 11:25.517
from the company to buy drugs,
we were near bankrupt.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.186
You know, he went to rehab.
I had to deal with the tax man.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.980
Those terrible bureaucrats!

11:30.581 --> 11:32.566
Initial, initial, initial, sign.

11:33.479 --> 11:35.912
And there's all that cash
I lent him to keep paying

11:36.037 --> 11:39.435
his bitch of an ex-wife alimony
and child support.

11:40.074 --> 11:43.243
I'm glad Jeff found Jesus. I wish he'd
have found a job at the same time.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.415
Amen.

11:45.419 --> 11:47.745
And, just this little
card here saying

11:47.917 --> 11:50.917
that the gun that your brother used
belonged to you.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.880
Your brother had attempted
suicide before, and...

11:56.050 --> 11:57.639
you loaned him a gun?

12:00.113 --> 12:01.776
I've been turning
this over for days,

12:01.901 --> 12:04.552
wondering if maybe
if the gun hadn't been there...

12:04.677 --> 12:07.559
Maybe if his girlfriend would
have agreed to marry him...

12:08.402 --> 12:11.605
Maybe if his ex-wife hadn't have
hounded him for every dime.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.943
<i>And, you know, with this insurance
and all the money that you'll...</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:16.551
$2 million sounds like...

12:16.676 --> 12:19.026
Under the radar,
and keep it that way, please.

12:19.151 --> 12:21.482
<i>... knowing that I'll never talk
to Jeff again,</i>

12:21.607 --> 12:24.743
I can tell you that insurance
is no relief at all.

12:28.759 --> 12:31.688
Okay, Chief, we blew up pictures
from the crime scene.

12:31.813 --> 12:32.908
Now, look.

12:33.310 --> 12:36.713
So, this looks like someone might
have been there, shooting the gun.

12:37.497 --> 12:38.799
What else do we know?

12:39.455 --> 12:41.824
The apartment belongs
to the church where Jeff went.

12:41.949 --> 12:45.514
Kind of a residence hotel for members
who were getting back on their feet.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.495
I spoke to the minister myself,

12:47.620 --> 12:49.976
pastor Paul Hicks
of the New Church of Good Faith.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.596
He said you can look through
the apartment, no problem.

12:52.721 --> 12:54.921
He'll sendcover Jeff's girlfriend
to open it up for you.

12:55.046 --> 12:56.979
Okay, thank you, Commander.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.945
Detective Sanchez,
how are you feeling?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.941
Great... good.

13:02.572 --> 13:03.573
No problem.

13:04.172 --> 13:05.951
Stand up, please. Lift your arm.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.478
- Does this hurt?
- No.

13:12.603 --> 13:14.035
- How about this?
- No.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.279
- This?
- No.

13:15.404 --> 13:17.417
Chief, he's fine! Really.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.611
We just got a couple of doctor reports
that are still outstanding, and...

13:21.736 --> 13:23.813
- it'll be done.
- I'd like to see those reports

13:23.938 --> 13:26.596
as soon as they come in.
All right, Detective.

13:26.987 --> 13:29.224
At least you're back and not hurting.
That's something.

13:30.246 --> 13:32.544
Hold down the fort for us, please.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.640
- You ready, Buzz?
- Roll him out, Lieutenant.

13:47.765 --> 13:49.161
Almost ready, Chief!

13:49.451 --> 13:52.317
- Take your time, Lieutenant.
- There you are.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.400
And ready.

13:59.644 --> 14:02.048
Okeydoke.
There's the bullet hole.

14:06.627 --> 14:08.680
No clothes, no books, no computer.

14:09.144 --> 14:10.148
Thank you.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.976
I can't get my landlord
to fix a faucet,

14:13.144 --> 14:16.268
and after three days, this place is all
cleaned up and ready to rent again.

14:16.393 --> 14:19.094
Our church doesn't rent
these places, sir.

14:19.470 --> 14:23.028
And the cleaning was mostly done by some
service recommended by the police.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.365
We just repainted the walls,
boxed up Jeff's stuff,

14:27.490 --> 14:29.346
and stacked it by the door.

14:30.121 --> 14:33.535
- And where's that stuff now?
- Maybe pastor Paul has it.

14:34.557 --> 14:37.459
And Jeff's car, too. I didn't see it
when I parked to let you in.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.922
Beth, I know this must be
hard for you, but...

14:43.586 --> 14:45.295
I can't even imagine.

14:46.027 --> 14:47.969
You must be very, very upset.

14:48.292 --> 14:49.292
And mad.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.313
I don't understand it.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.519
I was diagnosed with multiple
myeloma, last year.

14:56.644 --> 14:58.396
I'm fighting so hard to stay alive.

15:00.243 --> 15:02.440
I don't get how he could do this.

15:03.114 --> 15:04.751
I just don't get it.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.643
I hate to mention it, but I know
that Jeff asked you to marry him.

15:08.768 --> 15:12.764
Jeff didn't shoot himself because I
turned down his marriage proposal.

15:13.244 --> 15:15.580
I don't know
if you'll understand this.

15:16.258 --> 15:18.375
I met Jeff before I knew
I had cancer,

15:18.680 --> 15:21.092
But we didn't start dating
until afterwards.

15:21.217 --> 15:24.047
I thought, "maybe he's only
asking me 'cause I'm sick."

15:27.176 --> 15:28.497
So I told him...

15:30.018 --> 15:31.846
"try again when we beat this thing."

15:33.550 --> 15:34.766
Besides...

15:37.340 --> 15:40.619
... this is not how I wanted to
look on my wedding day.

15:41.727 --> 15:43.608
The ring was beautiful, though.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.868
2 carats.

15:47.998 --> 15:50.066
Maybe I should have accepted it.

15:52.894 --> 15:53.956
Anyway...

15:56.359 --> 15:57.163
so...

15:58.791 --> 16:01.209
Does any of this furniture
belong to you?

16:02.664 --> 16:03.503
No.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.507
We weren't living together.

16:05.837 --> 16:08.633
No. This is all church
property, really.

16:09.018 --> 16:11.428
Pastor Paul will find
someone else who needs it.

16:12.047 --> 16:13.513
Chief, we're set.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.126
Okay.

16:15.384 --> 16:17.955
Beth, would you mind calling pastor Paul
and letting him know

16:18.080 --> 16:20.868
that we're gonna stop by to speak
with him if he's available?

16:20.993 --> 16:22.600
- He'll be available.
- okay.

16:22.725 --> 16:25.055
We're a fairly small congregation.

16:25.557 --> 16:28.987
Lieutenant, would you please escort
Beth to her car? Thank you.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.856
- Andy, come closer, please.
- You got it, mike.

16:35.981 --> 16:37.037
Chief,

16:37.705 --> 16:40.114
when the shot was fired,
the victim's head was angled

16:40.239 --> 16:43.340
towards the right corner of this
bathroom, above the commode.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.587
- So, he's right, Mike?
- Yeah. There you go.

16:46.051 --> 16:48.901
He's standing right here, okay?

16:49.026 --> 16:50.293
All right, so...

16:52.303 --> 16:53.882
I'm Crawford's height.

16:54.007 --> 16:57.849
If I put my ring finger on the trigger,
gun behind my right ear...

16:59.040 --> 17:00.733
There's not enough room.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.687
So...

17:04.077 --> 17:04.939
Bang...

17:05.944 --> 17:06.950
He drops.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.196
Someone moved the body.

17:12.570 --> 17:13.570
Okay.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.660
I'm gonna have my parents
meet me at this church,

17:16.828 --> 17:20.106
and then I am delegating
the rest of the day to y'all.

17:21.757 --> 17:25.579
I just want to say one thing.
It will make life easier for everyone

17:25.704 --> 17:28.213
if we continue to treat
this death as a suicide.

17:28.994 --> 17:30.501
Is that understood?

17:31.822 --> 17:33.129
All right, then.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.512
Let's find out
who murdered Jeff Crawford.

17:37.370 --> 17:40.316
Hello, Mama. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

17:40.441 --> 17:42.769
I have a new possible venue
I want y'all to look at,

17:43.366 --> 17:44.758
in Hollywood.

18:00.966 --> 18:03.363
What kind of church
you say this was?

18:03.823 --> 18:06.531
We're unaffiliated
with any major denominations.

18:06.656 --> 18:09.010
Five years ago,
I was just a real-estate agent

18:09.135 --> 18:11.242
with a morning bible-study group
in Northridge.

18:11.367 --> 18:12.674
Now, we're a church.

18:13.124 --> 18:14.926
And as we grow,
we need bigger spaces.

18:15.221 --> 18:18.699
We had the opportunity to purchase this
skating rink for only $100 a square ft,

18:18.824 --> 18:21.527
You sound like quite a shrewd
investor, Pastor.

18:21.652 --> 18:25.641
"See a man diligent in his business,
and he shall stand before kings."

18:25.766 --> 18:28.391
We flipped a couple of small businesses,
and then, we plow the profits

18:28.516 --> 18:30.041
back into the ministry.

18:30.166 --> 18:32.113
The apartment building
you were in, it houses

18:32.238 --> 18:34.612
several people with critical
problems, folks...

18:34.781 --> 18:37.910
out of rehab, folks
who have lost their homes.

18:38.197 --> 18:41.319
Would it be rude to ask
If we could sit in

18:41.444 --> 18:43.121
with this prayer group over there?

18:43.931 --> 18:45.970
That is an in-reach meeting.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.595
Overcoming sexual addiction.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.759
We're gonna go look around
while you talk to Brenda.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.330
Come on, Willie Ray. Let's see
how they've sanctified

18:59.455 --> 19:01.097
the concession stand.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.394
This is a church!

19:09.197 --> 19:12.444
When Jeff came to us two years ago,
he was broken,

19:13.061 --> 19:14.353
looking to heal.

19:14.478 --> 19:16.406
Over time, his spirits
improved greatly.

19:16.531 --> 19:19.509
And supervising renovations here
boosted his self-esteem.

19:19.634 --> 19:21.519
You knew About Jeff Crawford's past,

19:21.644 --> 19:24.489
and still you gave him access
to your finances?

19:24.614 --> 19:26.497
If you're asking if I knew
he was an addict

19:26.667 --> 19:28.625
who embezzled money
from his brother...

19:29.008 --> 19:30.975
Yes, I knew who he was.

19:31.836 --> 19:34.532
And I knew who he was
struggling to become.

19:34.891 --> 19:36.226
Coffee, anyone?

19:37.134 --> 19:39.105
He raised money
for our building fund.

19:39.230 --> 19:42.360
And he set up internet sites
for several members of our church

19:42.485 --> 19:44.957
with health issues
but no insurance, like Beth.

19:45.082 --> 19:45.892
In fact,

19:46.060 --> 19:49.161
the web pages he put together
to raise donations for her chemo

19:49.286 --> 19:53.284
Actually became the prototype
for all our members in financial crisis.

19:54.404 --> 19:58.385
And he helped me renovate this building
while we used it as a house of worship.

20:00.033 --> 20:03.186
So, when he didn't show up
for services on Sunday morning...

20:03.311 --> 20:07.293
Completely unlike him, especially since
he helps me set up the sound system.

20:08.155 --> 20:10.294
So, when I was finished here...

20:11.409 --> 20:13.044
I let myself Into his apartment.

20:13.748 --> 20:15.953
- You had a key?
- Somewhere.

20:16.078 --> 20:18.591
But I didn't need one.
He left one out for people.

20:19.973 --> 20:22.614
Do you no longer think
his death was a suicide?

20:22.739 --> 20:25.131
We're just trying to clear up
a few inconsistencies.

20:25.256 --> 20:28.476
Like why it appears that Jeff's body
was moved after he was shot.

20:29.337 --> 20:30.895
- I did that.
- Why?

20:32.337 --> 20:35.817
Well, when I saw him lying there,
my impulse was to help.

20:36.478 --> 20:39.399
- Isn't that what anyone would do?
- Of course.

20:39.524 --> 20:41.093
Of course it is, sir.

20:41.218 --> 20:44.075
One last thing. All of Jeff's
belongings were packed up,

20:44.243 --> 20:48.206
And someone just swooped in
and grabbed them all, including his car.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.889
That would be his ex-wife, I'm sure.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.774
She called yesterday and asked
if I would give back the money

20:53.899 --> 20:56.214
Jeff donated to the Church,
If you can believe that.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.966
Dana Crawford. I've got her number
here, somewhere... here it is.

21:05.723 --> 21:09.183
Tell me, Pastor,
do you always preach in sandals?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.894
I do. Same as Jesus.

21:11.406 --> 21:12.411
Brenda...

21:12.928 --> 21:16.900
Would you believe
they do baptisms in a hot tub?

21:18.107 --> 21:19.930
What about weddings, Pastor?

21:20.055 --> 21:23.225
You know, roller derby always seemed
to me like the perfect preparation

21:23.407 --> 21:24.616
for marriage.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.952
Lieutenant. Ma, Daddy,
Would you come with me?

21:31.224 --> 21:32.315
Brenda, I...

21:32.937 --> 21:35.506
I don't want to seem
old-fashioned, but this place...

21:35.631 --> 21:38.435
No. I know Daddy.
It was just a thought.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.574
And if y'all don't like it...

21:41.964 --> 21:44.369
This suicide Has turned out
to be a lot more...

21:44.494 --> 21:46.596
complicated than I'd expected.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.725
So if y'all could just keep looking
without me and take real good pictures,

21:50.893 --> 21:53.353
I'm pretty sure I could meet up
with you at about 3:00.

21:53.521 --> 21:57.511
We were supposed to look for the place
you're gonna marry Fritz together.

21:57.773 --> 22:00.034
And you investigate murders,
not suicide.

22:00.159 --> 22:02.193
Daddy, please
don't make this harder for me.

22:02.418 --> 22:06.157
I want to come with y'all, but I just,
I can't be in two places at one time.

22:08.771 --> 22:09.789
I'll...

22:10.048 --> 22:12.017
I'll meet with you soon, okay?

22:13.216 --> 22:14.958
You remember where the door is?

22:15.544 --> 22:16.579
Okay.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.099
- Do you mind?
- I just got off a shift, and I'm dying.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.310
Actually, I do, ms. Crawford.

22:35.842 --> 22:38.451
Can I offer you
a piece of candy instead?

22:40.117 --> 22:42.612
- What do you have?
- Well, let's see.

22:48.322 --> 22:49.390
It's yours.

22:58.524 --> 22:59.524
So...

23:00.084 --> 23:01.587
What did jeff do?

23:02.312 --> 23:04.632
No. I know he killed himself,
obviously.

23:05.126 --> 23:06.920
But he must have
stolen something, too,

23:07.045 --> 23:08.873
or I wouldn't be back here
at the L.A.P.D.

23:08.998 --> 23:11.014
I'm just investigating his suicide,

23:11.182 --> 23:12.849
ms. Crawford, which has been made

23:13.017 --> 23:15.122
much more difficult `cause
his belongings are missing.

23:15.386 --> 23:17.228
What are you looking for?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.594
An explanation.

23:18.813 --> 23:21.207
A suicide note
on his computer, perhaps.

23:21.332 --> 23:22.442
No, I didn't see one.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.193
You do have his computer, then.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.589
Yeah, I gave it to my son.

23:27.501 --> 23:29.296
Ms. Crawford,
you may not realize this,

23:29.421 --> 23:31.741
but since you're no longer
next of kin and his brother,

23:31.866 --> 23:35.265
Ed, is Jeff's actual heir,
you had no right to remove any of his...

23:35.390 --> 23:38.283
Did jeff have a right to empty
our bank accounts, spend all our kids'

23:38.408 --> 23:39.969
college money on drugs?

23:40.440 --> 23:42.712
I think what he had belongs to me.

23:42.961 --> 23:45.331
Including another
woman's engagement ring?

23:45.809 --> 23:48.757
His girlfriend told us
that he offered her a diamond ring,

23:48.882 --> 23:50.386
and we couldn't find it anywhere.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.885
I didn't see any engagement ring.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.641
Trust me.
I looked through everything.

23:56.223 --> 23:58.256
You want to understand
why Jeff is dead?

23:58.796 --> 24:00.148
How about this:

24:00.772 --> 24:03.691
Jeff stole
from anyone he was close to,

24:03.951 --> 24:05.178
that church,

24:05.565 --> 24:06.767
his new girlfriend,

24:06.972 --> 24:07.862
cancer girl.

24:08.552 --> 24:11.555
He probably robbed them all blind
and then felt guilty about it.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.885
He always felt guilty
whenever he screwed anybody over.

24:15.010 --> 24:15.787
Then...

24:19.556 --> 24:22.627
Well, ms. Crawford,
thank you so much for stopping by.

24:23.694 --> 24:26.214
I'm gonna send one
of my officers home with you to

24:26.382 --> 24:29.592
retrieve your ex-husband's belongings,
including his automobile.

24:29.977 --> 24:31.525
No. You won't.

24:31.936 --> 24:33.930
`cause I'm not turning anything
over to you people.

24:34.304 --> 24:36.457
Do I need to remind you
that you have no right

24:36.582 --> 24:38.435
to any of your
ex-husband's belongings?

24:38.560 --> 24:39.769
So sue me!

24:41.052 --> 24:42.295
I'll do better than that.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.200
You have the right to remain silent.

24:44.325 --> 24:47.131
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

24:47.256 --> 24:49.195
You're arresting me?
What for?

24:49.363 --> 24:51.948
We'll start with grand theft
and see what else comes to mind.

24:55.098 --> 24:56.828
Lieutenant Flynn,
I need you, please.

24:57.849 --> 25:00.848
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

25:00.973 --> 25:03.152
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford...

25:03.277 --> 25:04.293
You can't do this.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.963
I have to get home
and make dinner for my kids!

25:07.131 --> 25:09.141
Well, you could always choose
to cooperate.

25:09.888 --> 25:13.155
Or I could call the department
of children and family services.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.056
I'm sure that they would be happy
to hold your kids while we investigate.

25:17.496 --> 25:20.184
And while you're in jail,
you could quit smoking.

25:24.570 --> 25:28.508
If this pile of crap represents the sum
total of Crawford's worldly possessions,

25:28.711 --> 25:31.288
I'm beginning to understand
his interest in an afterlife.

25:31.413 --> 25:35.051
A bill for Beth Gibson's
cancer treatment from Crawford's car.

25:36.841 --> 25:39.996
One round of chemotherapy, $6,600?

25:40.337 --> 25:43.627
Yeah, crawford thought
cocaine was an expensive habit.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.335
And here's some past-due
credit-card notices,

25:46.503 --> 25:48.920
a court warning for
unpaid child support.

25:49.305 --> 25:52.383
I ran a master inquiry
on Jeff Crawford,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.741
and a contact card came up
from saturday night.

25:54.866 --> 25:57.722
Apparently, there was
a disturbance at a doctor's office,

25:57.984 --> 25:59.907
but the crime report
wasn't finished 'cause

26:00.032 --> 26:02.023
Jeff took off
before anyone got there.

26:02.295 --> 26:04.437
But the nurse said
he was asking for drugs.

26:05.002 --> 26:07.108
He asked for drugs
at the doctor's office?

26:08.969 --> 26:10.162
Lieutenant.

26:12.927 --> 26:15.198
Detective Sanchez's papers.
You said you'd have them for me.

26:15.558 --> 26:18.318
Chief, I'm still working
on getting the last of it done.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.707
But, geez,
can't you wait a couple of days?

26:21.166 --> 26:22.411
Honestly,

26:22.720 --> 26:23.788
he's okay.

26:28.344 --> 26:29.404
Hey, chief.

26:30.092 --> 26:31.631
How's the delegating going?

26:32.355 --> 26:33.448
Great.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.775
Any sign of the engagement ring?

26:36.318 --> 26:37.319
No.

26:37.444 --> 26:39.806
Chief, pastor Hicks is here.

26:40.077 --> 26:42.391
I talked him
into stopping by again like you asked.

26:42.694 --> 26:45.498
You want me to handle this?
So, you can meet up with your parents.

26:45.957 --> 26:48.397
You know what?
I'll be in and out really fast, just...

26:49.062 --> 26:50.572
in and out really fast.

26:51.194 --> 26:52.813
Detective, thank you.

26:53.338 --> 26:54.690
Lieutenant Flynn,

26:54.815 --> 26:56.985
just one minute, one minute.

27:01.449 --> 27:04.111
Pastor Hicks,
thank you so much for stopping by.

27:04.364 --> 27:06.082
I just have a few things
for you to sign.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.251
And would you mind
going over a summary

27:08.419 --> 27:11.342
of the statement that you gave us
yesterday to make sure it's accurate?

27:11.467 --> 27:12.630
Thank you so much.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.289
What is this consent form?

27:17.601 --> 27:19.762
That allows us
to examine your church finances,

27:19.930 --> 27:23.318
including associated accounts
like Beth Gibson's recovery fund.

27:23.443 --> 27:26.102
No way. I will not open church accounts
without a court order.

27:26.358 --> 27:28.928
- Then I'll ask for a search warrant.
- On what grounds?

27:29.053 --> 27:30.940
How would you justify
invading our privacy?

27:31.108 --> 27:33.234
- A man with...
- By alleging that we are the unknowing

27:33.402 --> 27:34.986
victims of a theft by Jeff Crawford?

27:35.296 --> 27:37.015
"Unknowing", that's your word.

27:37.248 --> 27:38.864
How can we be sure you didn't know?

27:39.697 --> 27:41.842
So now I'm somehow
responsible for his suicide?

27:41.967 --> 27:44.537
I talked Jeffrey into rehab.
I saved him from addiction.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.767
- This is incredible.
- What strikes me as incredible

27:46.892 --> 27:49.250
is how a man
in the throes of financial disaster

27:49.418 --> 27:52.308
was somehow able to purchase
a diamond engagement ring.

27:52.433 --> 27:54.171
With a loan on a deposit of $500.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.466
- I even co-signed the financing papers.
- So, where's the ring now, padre?

27:59.344 --> 28:01.906
When Beth turned him down,
he returned it for the deposit...

28:02.461 --> 28:03.713
And then immediately

28:03.947 --> 28:06.241
donated the cash
into Beth's health fund

28:06.446 --> 28:08.317
because he was such a monster.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.477
First, this was a suicide.

28:11.602 --> 28:14.059
Now you're accusing
a minister of murder?

28:14.340 --> 28:17.060
No accusations were made.
I only asked to check on the finances.

28:17.185 --> 28:18.913
And I went through
the proper channels.

28:19.038 --> 28:20.593
Let's step back a little bit here.

28:20.718 --> 28:22.479
Pastor Hicks
might be upset right now,

28:22.604 --> 28:25.513
but if the accounts reveal
no theft connected to the victim,

28:25.638 --> 28:29.108
perhaps a simple apology tomorrow
from chief Johnson

28:29.390 --> 28:30.499
might do the trick.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.661
In terms of contributions
to the recovery fund

28:32.786 --> 28:35.588
the victim set up for his girlfriend,
the account balances out perfectly,

28:35.931 --> 28:39.050
including a $500 deposit that
the victim made days before his death.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.741
- In other words, clean as a whistle.
- But pastor Hicks

28:41.866 --> 28:44.180
flips funds around in ways
that would impress a swiss banker.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.432
You're suggesting
this is a motive for murder?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.540
If I didn't believe
that murder had taken place,

28:48.665 --> 28:51.515
- why would I be pursuing this?
- I don't know. It's what you do.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.877
When you're a hammer, everything
in the world looks like a nail.

29:03.072 --> 29:04.200
Yes? Hello?

29:04.462 --> 29:05.897
Chief, you do realize

29:06.022 --> 29:08.599
your parents have been waiting
in your office for an hour and a half.

29:08.724 --> 29:11.644
Yes, lieutenant, if you could keep them
occupied for one more moment, please.

29:11.769 --> 29:13.154
No, you don't understand.

29:13.362 --> 29:15.185
I wasn't here when they arrived.

29:15.310 --> 29:18.518
They've been stuck in your office
all this time with Flynn.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.821
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.989
In 5 seconds, I have to prepare you
for what you're about to face.

29:29.114 --> 29:32.561
My suggestion is, don't argue,
don't defend. Just say, "I'm sorry."

29:32.729 --> 29:34.034
You got it? "I'm sorry."

29:34.159 --> 29:35.663
I'm... I'm so sorry.

29:35.788 --> 29:38.750
Brenda leigh, I know
my time's not worth anything,

29:39.119 --> 29:40.694
but your mother deserves better.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.139
Oh, clay, please.
I can speak for myself.

29:43.264 --> 29:44.808
Answer me one question.

29:45.112 --> 29:47.250
Do you intend to go through
with this wedding?

29:47.375 --> 29:48.202
Of course!

29:48.370 --> 29:50.914
Did we stop on our way
to Hawaii for nothing?

29:51.261 --> 29:54.125
I mean, you've got us running
Hither and Thither and Yon.

29:54.641 --> 29:55.405
Why?

29:55.530 --> 29:58.466
- Daddy, of course i'm getting married!
- You know what? We're all hungry.

29:58.591 --> 29:59.755
Starving, actually.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.314
Why don't we have a nice dinner?
Just, the four of us.

30:02.439 --> 30:04.351
Not me. I'm tired.

30:04.597 --> 30:06.816
I've got indigestion.
I want to lay down.

30:06.941 --> 30:08.869
Daddy, please.
I want to talk about this.

30:08.994 --> 30:10.724
- I just...
- Clay?

30:11.014 --> 30:12.435
- Daddy?
- Are you all right?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.838
- Daddy?
- Somebody call an ambulance,

30:14.963 --> 30:16.605
and bring me an aspirin for him.

30:16.937 --> 30:18.607
- Daddy?
- We need some help here!

30:18.998 --> 30:21.152
- We need some help here!
- Sit. Sit. Sit. Are you okay?

30:22.431 --> 30:23.773
Daddy! Daddy!

30:24.850 --> 30:27.074
Stay here. Stay here. Stay here.

30:35.158 --> 30:36.159
Well,

30:36.451 --> 30:38.461
the doctor said that the stent

30:38.629 --> 30:41.088
in your father's main left artery

30:41.435 --> 30:42.778
had closed off.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.844
When did daddy
get a stent put in his heart?

30:47.361 --> 30:49.038
Now don't be upset with us.

30:49.163 --> 30:50.848
Your father
had his first heart attack

30:51.618 --> 30:53.283
over two years ago.

30:53.408 --> 30:55.895
You were miles away,
and we didn't want to bother you.

30:56.620 --> 30:57.638
Besides,

30:58.023 --> 31:01.193
this wasn't nearly
as bad as the last time.

31:02.479 --> 31:03.839
How do you know?

31:04.042 --> 31:06.172
When I had my first heart attack...

31:07.654 --> 31:09.229
The pain was so bad,

31:09.876 --> 31:11.410
I wanted to die.

31:13.247 --> 31:15.289
This time,
I just wanted to kill you.

31:19.447 --> 31:20.615
Sorry, daddy.

31:22.370 --> 31:24.337
I didn't mean to put you off.
I just...

31:24.605 --> 31:25.549
Brenda Leigh,

31:26.362 --> 31:29.508
I don't want to hear you say
"I'm sorry" one more time.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.765
The doctor said the stent was bad

31:33.502 --> 31:37.280
and that I was lucky to be
in a police station when it collapsed.

31:38.839 --> 31:41.823
So you can't take credit
for all my suffering.

31:45.717 --> 31:48.855
And if you want to do something
that would make me feel better,

31:49.239 --> 31:51.425
you can go out
and get me a bottle of aspirin.

31:52.121 --> 31:53.285
Daddy, it's a hospital.

31:54.399 --> 31:56.335
If you need an aspirin,
they've got plenty.

31:56.460 --> 31:57.792
$10 a pill.

31:58.545 --> 32:01.966
As long as I'm in this bed,
they've got one hand in my chest

32:02.091 --> 32:04.023
and one hand in my wallet.

32:05.444 --> 32:07.713
When I see that itemized bill...

32:08.355 --> 32:11.026
Insurance doesn't cover everything,
you know...

32:11.709 --> 32:15.307
It's gonna be enough
to make my heart stop dead.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.567
Daddy, don't say that.

32:23.353 --> 32:26.116
I know I may not always
show it the right way, but...

32:26.962 --> 32:28.529
I love you so much.

32:35.652 --> 32:37.426
- How's he feeling?
- Good.

32:37.551 --> 32:40.081
We just need to pick up
a few things from the pharmacy.

32:40.619 --> 32:43.506
We're in a cardiac ward.
It says everywhere "no cellphones."

32:43.631 --> 32:45.237
That's just a suggestion.

32:47.715 --> 32:50.244
Detective Daniels.
Oh, thank god you're still there.

32:51.793 --> 32:53.089
Better. Thank you.

32:54.410 --> 32:56.730
That medical bill
for Beth Gibson's chemo?

32:56.855 --> 32:59.050
Could you pull it for me,
please, right now?

32:59.321 --> 33:00.664
Thank you so much.

33:10.231 --> 33:11.231
Set.

33:19.239 --> 33:21.999
Ms. Gibson,
thank you so much for coming in.

33:22.572 --> 33:24.061
How are you feeling today?

33:24.186 --> 33:26.564
Physically, the further from chemo,
the better.

33:26.919 --> 33:29.239
Spiritually, I'm sick to death.

33:29.364 --> 33:32.577
Well, I don't know what kind of help
I can give you for your soul, but

33:33.407 --> 33:35.635
I might be able
to help with the nausea.

33:35.981 --> 33:39.767
First, could you please help me
sort through some of Jeff's things here?

33:42.155 --> 33:44.361
Is there anything here
that doesn't belong

33:44.987 --> 33:46.222
or anything missing?

33:46.622 --> 33:49.084
- Well, that's not his gun.
- How do you know?

33:49.653 --> 33:52.863
His was borrowed from his brother,
and it was more old-fashioned.

33:54.354 --> 33:55.589
Yes, it was.

33:55.906 --> 33:58.035
You've got a good eye, Beth.
That helps me a lot.

33:59.301 --> 34:00.500
This is my gun.

34:02.487 --> 34:04.123
Now, one more thing.

34:04.849 --> 34:05.942
I'm told

34:06.526 --> 34:07.544
that the drugs

34:07.928 --> 34:10.998
most commonly used to treat
multiple myeloma are

34:11.123 --> 34:13.051
excuse me while I butcher the names.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.871
Oncovin, decadron, and doxil.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.078
Which one are you receiving?

34:18.333 --> 34:20.737
Well, it's more of a mixture,
really.

34:21.779 --> 34:24.341
Pastor Paul tells me
I should think of my treatments

34:25.129 --> 34:27.203
as part drugs and part prayer.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.356
But your medical statement
should be itemized.

34:30.481 --> 34:33.172
You get so much as an aspirin,
and they charge you for it.

34:34.174 --> 34:36.844
We found this bill in Jeff's car.

34:37.145 --> 34:39.540
I guess he needed it
for the doctor's address.

34:39.665 --> 34:42.768
And it says here
that you paid over $6,000

34:42.893 --> 34:44.456
for a single chemotherapy treatment.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.920
But without specifically
naming the drugs,

34:47.045 --> 34:49.768
I was concerned that you might
not have gotten what you paid for.

34:50.376 --> 34:52.715
So we visited
your oncologist's office today

34:53.356 --> 34:55.484
and showed him this picture of Jeff.

34:56.167 --> 34:57.533
Now, the receptionist said

34:57.658 --> 35:00.431
said she rembers him
from an incident last saturday,

35:00.792 --> 35:02.558
you know, where
the police were called

35:02.726 --> 35:06.395
because Jeff stormed in, demanding drugs
and better painkillers for you?

35:06.863 --> 35:10.274
And the doctor told us that
he didn't give Jeff the drug

35:10.442 --> 35:13.902
or the painkillers for you because,
well, you aren't a patient.

35:14.747 --> 35:16.780
You did see
this oncologist last year,

35:16.948 --> 35:20.331
but when your biopsy results
were negative, you didn't return.

35:20.456 --> 35:22.094
I would say
your faith made you whole.

35:22.219 --> 35:24.587
But, as it turns out,
you were never sick to begin with.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.832
And this bill, it's a fake.

35:27.087 --> 35:29.640
You forged it,
so, instead of a miracle,

35:29.765 --> 35:32.148
that makes your good health
more of a scam.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.337
Beth Gibson,
you have the right to remain silent.

35:35.462 --> 35:38.093
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

35:38.429 --> 35:40.031
You have the right to an attorney.

35:40.156 --> 35:43.261
If you cannot afford an attorney, one
will be appointed to you by the state.

35:43.386 --> 35:46.131
Have you heard
and understood these rights?

35:47.161 --> 35:48.270
Okay.

35:48.666 --> 35:52.107
Listen, I found a lump under my arm,

35:52.275 --> 35:53.923
and I had a biopsy, and

35:54.208 --> 35:56.195
I shared my fear
at a prayer meeting...

35:57.124 --> 35:59.440
And people were so worried for me.

35:59.803 --> 36:02.277
I felt so loved, so cared for.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.421
And I knew that
if I told them that I was fine,

36:05.546 --> 36:07.393
all that would go away.

36:08.322 --> 36:10.316
So this all began very innocently.

36:12.092 --> 36:13.978
"Judge not lest ye be judged."

36:14.433 --> 36:16.485
I believe that with my whole heart.

36:17.608 --> 36:18.608
But...

36:19.043 --> 36:20.511
and this is important, Beth,

36:22.047 --> 36:25.293
people want to understand why
Jeff Crawford shot himself in the head.

36:25.664 --> 36:27.684
And I think you know why.

36:29.578 --> 36:32.150
After jeff came back from the doctor
that you weren't seeing,

36:32.275 --> 36:33.701
what happened?

36:35.241 --> 36:37.720
I'd never seen anyone so angry.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.684
And disappointed.

36:42.490 --> 36:44.050
First, I thought, you know,

36:44.275 --> 36:47.171
maybe he'd be at least a little happy
that I wasn't dying,

36:48.018 --> 36:49.737
but... that didn't happen.

36:51.030 --> 36:52.645
- He cried.
- I cried.

36:54.231 --> 36:56.751
But then he calmed down,
and he forgave me.

36:58.195 --> 37:00.551
Because he said god
would forgive me,

37:02.169 --> 37:05.064
but that I had to go
in front of the whole church

37:05.569 --> 37:08.523
and pastor Paul, too,
and ask their forgiveness.

37:09.766 --> 37:11.152
And I said I would.

37:12.737 --> 37:13.805
And then...

37:15.925 --> 37:17.139
And then I left.

37:18.574 --> 37:20.188
But I should have stayed.

37:21.809 --> 37:23.718
He needed to be with someone.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.166
Well,

37:25.869 --> 37:28.392
if it's any solace,
Jeff didn't die alone.

37:35.465 --> 37:36.358
What's that?

37:36.483 --> 37:37.872
That's a photo of the blood

37:37.997 --> 37:40.609
left on the door of the bathroom
where Jeff was shot.

37:40.734 --> 37:43.260
To most,
it looks like an abstract painting.

37:43.428 --> 37:47.362
But to us, it looks like the outline
of the person that shot him.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.127
And it fits you perfectly.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.877
You already told me that
you knew Jeff had a gun.

37:53.002 --> 37:55.498
You even described it for me.
Not that it matters, really.

37:55.731 --> 37:56.883
Why do you say that?

37:57.008 --> 37:59.109
That website set up to pay for
your chemo treatment.

37:59.679 --> 38:01.521
Every donation you accepted

38:01.646 --> 38:03.380
becomes a count of wire fraud,

38:03.505 --> 38:05.949
each one punishable
by three years in prison.

38:06.822 --> 38:10.245
And, sweetheart,
those years pile up real fast.

38:10.532 --> 38:12.831
You should have spent some of that money
going to the doctor.

38:13.235 --> 38:16.043
Keeping it,
that's how I knew you were a fraud!

38:16.500 --> 38:18.519
Listen, I was even gonna give back

38:18.644 --> 38:20.980
all of the money raised
for my medical treatments

38:21.105 --> 38:22.215
and marry him.

38:22.503 --> 38:25.886
I only picked up the gun
to scare him, and then it went off.

38:26.956 --> 38:29.583
All I asked from Jeff
was some time...

38:30.957 --> 38:33.226
To make it look like
I'd gotten well.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.422
But he wouldn't even give me that.

38:40.224 --> 38:42.994
Well, maybe Jeff wasn't willing
to give you time, but we will.

38:44.429 --> 38:46.774
I know a life sentence
can seem daunting. But...

38:46.991 --> 38:49.244
on the bright side,
at least you don't have cancer.

38:51.503 --> 38:52.537
Gentlemen.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.645
Ms. Gibson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jeff Crawford.

38:58.387 --> 39:00.373
And if you don't mind my saying it,

39:00.715 --> 39:02.718
may god have mercy on your soul.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.536
- How is your father?
- Thanks for asking.

39:09.661 --> 39:11.301
He's being released tomorrow.

39:11.426 --> 39:13.800
Luckily, they have trip insurance
for their cruise.

39:14.209 --> 39:17.455
Can't travel for another week,
so he'll be recuperating with us.

39:18.302 --> 39:19.815
Ah. Well, good luck with that.

39:21.294 --> 39:23.798
Oh, listen, I checked into
the Sanchez situation for you.

39:24.287 --> 39:25.998
The head of physical rehab says

39:26.123 --> 39:28.065
his recovery
has been nothing short of amazing,

39:28.190 --> 39:30.411
and he's signed off
on a return to full active duty.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.536
Good.

39:32.118 --> 39:33.120
Unfortunately,

39:33.395 --> 39:36.039
behavioral does not agree,
and they won't until

39:36.207 --> 39:38.476
Sanchez cooperates with a therapist.

39:39.226 --> 39:42.212
Lt Provenza's been covering for Julio.
I knew it!

39:42.622 --> 39:44.553
Let's give Provenza a break.

39:44.782 --> 39:47.524
I mean, Sanchez literally
took a bullet for him.

39:47.649 --> 39:49.216
He just trying to help the guy.

39:49.442 --> 39:52.639
My advice is, we let him.
Provenza's cagey. He'll find a way.

39:54.762 --> 39:55.880
Thanks.

39:58.544 --> 39:59.963
That's what you need...

40:00.213 --> 40:01.247
Hey, chief.

40:04.210 --> 40:06.361
Working on getting that paperwork
for you.

40:06.745 --> 40:08.247
It should be here any day.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.252
All right.

40:13.028 --> 40:14.822
Keep me informed, lieutenant.

40:23.563 --> 40:24.723
Here we go.

40:25.532 --> 40:26.650
Good.

40:27.009 --> 40:27.841
Good.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.551
OK, daddy. Now, is that better?

40:29.932 --> 40:31.386
Compared to what?

40:31.767 --> 40:35.147
I ought to be watching
the hawaiian sunrise over your mother,

40:35.272 --> 40:38.689
and here I am, sitting on your couch,
about to watch "the price is right."

40:39.166 --> 40:41.021
Well, at least
it comes on earlier here.

40:41.904 --> 40:44.916
Your father always wins
the big showcase.

40:45.146 --> 40:46.943
Know the true value of things.

40:47.838 --> 40:50.233
That's the way
the Johnsons were raised.

40:55.249 --> 40:57.861
... now that we have
your father settled,

40:58.748 --> 41:00.778
how would you like to be married

41:00.903 --> 41:03.001
on the balcony of a nice hotel room

41:03.538 --> 41:04.920
overlooking the ocean

41:05.088 --> 41:06.982
with just your father and me

41:07.107 --> 41:09.550
and Fritz's sister as witnesses?

41:09.842 --> 41:13.211
And then we could come back here
for a big party afterwards?

41:14.440 --> 41:15.972
How do you always know?

41:17.659 --> 41:19.499
Well, this time, she had a spy.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.212
I just have one teeny,
teeny request.

41:23.929 --> 41:25.982
I know this ceremony
isn't supposed to be....

41:26.150 --> 41:28.862
No, no, no, no, no, ma.
I want to wear your dress.

41:29.601 --> 41:32.364
I promise, I would never pretend
about something so important.

41:33.419 --> 41:34.595
That's good.

41:35.431 --> 41:36.660
Then it's settled.

41:38.277 --> 41:39.287
Brenda Leigh,

41:39.541 --> 41:42.791
your television's not working!
I can't get it to come on.

41:43.094 --> 41:46.002
How come y'all have about
a million remotes

41:46.170 --> 41:47.754
and not one of them works?

41:48.608 --> 41:50.423
You know, I have a feeling,

41:50.934 --> 41:54.067
now that these wedding plans
are exactly the way you want them...

41:54.192 --> 41:55.838
It may just happen.

41:56.794 --> 41:58.305
You can count on it.

41:58.430 --> 42:00.337
Oh, there we go.

42:05.395 --> 42:07.932
There's nothing but snow.
It looks like the Arctic!

42:08.609 --> 42:10.569
I think I see a dogsled in there.

42:13.210 --> 42:15.878
Can't you get it to turn on?!

42:16.345 --> 42:19.096
Clay, calm down right now

42:19.221 --> 42:23.165
or I'm gonna get it on c-span
and leave you here all by yourself.

42:24.247 --> 42:25.491
Now, let me see.
