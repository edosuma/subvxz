WEBVTT

00:05.638 --> 00:08.232
- Syd, you can't blame yourself.
- Sure, I can.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.942
- She was playing you.
- Maybe.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.707
- What were you supposed to do?
- Listened.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.612
You're talking as though
you can trust a word she says.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.916
We know we can't.
We could have played her.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.511
If you second-guess,
you'll drive yourself crazy.

00:20.587 --> 00:24.182
I keep checking my voice mail,
just hoping Will's called.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.225
Told us where he is.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.627
So Carrie and I went out.
It was great. We got sushi.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.426
And when we got there,
the guy behind the counter,

00:32.499 --> 00:36.060
like, the little sushi...
They were like, "He-e-e-e-y!"

00:36.136 --> 00:37.770
You know, like they knew us.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.772
They do that at sushi places.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.007
Really? Oh.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.276
Anyway, it was great.
We had a fantastic meal.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.011
So what's the problem?

00:46.012 --> 00:48.380
Post-fish, when I went
to drop her off,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.616
this is traditionally,
classically,

00:50.617 --> 00:54.075
the time where I would...
or a man would... kiss her.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.355
And, well,
I just started sweating.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.190
- How bad?
- Bad. Weird bad.

00:58.191 --> 00:59.358
Freak-show bad.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.426
Did she notice?

01:00.427 --> 01:02.394
It was like I just got out
of the lap pool.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.663
- Okay. You need help.
- With the ladies.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.861
It's sort of a Catch-22.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.002
Go ahead. Keep going.
I'm listening.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.302
See, to feel comfortable,
you have to have experience.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.906
And to have experience,
you have to not be you.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.309
I was almost killed,

01:17.310 --> 01:20.108
and the doctors didn't think
I was gonna make it.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.172
And the thing that I learned
from that experience...

01:24.751 --> 01:27.251
Thanks.

01:28.721 --> 01:32.088
Syd, we're receiving intel
on a local top-secret server

01:32.158 --> 01:33.559
from outside the building.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.427
- Who's sending the signal?
- Your mother.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.529
We just got an upload.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.294
It's the DNA string
of the person who was doubled.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.967
As soon as Will is located,

01:41.968 --> 01:44.103
bring him in to compare this
to his DNA.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.471
We're verifying the data now.
It looks legit. Legitimate.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.771
Yeah.
I know what "legit" means.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.545
What else do they know?

01:53.546 --> 01:56.913
Did Sydney tell you
what the CIA knows, or Jack?

01:58.017 --> 02:00.352
I didn't say Jack was involved.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.487
Of course you did.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.988
In the car,
you mentioned his name.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.854
God.
I'm losing my mind.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.522
The CIA doesn't know anything.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.100
That's the problem.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.670
It doesn't make any sense,
does it?

02:23.743 --> 02:28.942
The entire CIA, and they have
no idea who the double is.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.483
It just shows
how wrong they can be.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.685
Now they think I'm a killer.

02:33.686 --> 02:36.678
Which I am, by the way.
I've killed people.

02:36.756 --> 02:39.281
People who were trying
to kill you.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.693
So what?
Does that make it easy, or...

02:41.694 --> 02:43.428
Francie, I ended someone's life.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.557
Two people's lives.
I'm a killer.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.901
I shouldn't be yelling this.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.749 --> 03:05.249
You're warm.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.922
Hold it!
Hands where I can see them!

03:14.994 --> 03:17.519
Yeah, it's him.
It's Tippin.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.351
Tell me.

03:39.352 --> 03:43.186
We received the DNA string
of the person who was doubled.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.790
Your DNA didn't match.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.725
There was no Provacillium
in your blood.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.293
You've been cleared.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.431
Thank God for you.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.932
You're okay.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.703
What about Francie?

03:57.704 --> 04:00.468
Francie's been questioned.
She's at home. She's fine.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.974
Thank you.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.209
Oh, what I said
about not trusting you...

04:04.210 --> 04:07.179
- Will, don't worry about it.
- I was scared to death.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.707
I didn't mean those things.
You know that.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.308
I trust you
more than I trust anyone.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.389
I'm sorry about the cell.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.951
They're gonna need you to stay.
They've got a lot of questions.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.194
Okay.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.229
And there's a therapist
who's gonna work with you

04:24.230 --> 04:26.730
to try to reverse
your memory conditioning.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.702
That file, the DNA string,
was there a name attached to it?

04:31.804 --> 04:33.438
There was.
We don't have any leads.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.340
What was the name?

04:35.341 --> 04:37.841
A.G. Doren.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.941
I'm just so relieved for him.
It's like I can breathe again.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.544
You know where it's fun?
Santa Barbara. You ever been?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.154
Yeah. I love it.
The zoo.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.789
That giraffe
with the crooked neck.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.520
I mean the beach.
The Biltmore. The food.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.727
La Superica.
You ever been there?

04:55.728 --> 04:56.928
No.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.630
Okay.
We're going this weekend.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.866
Yeah. Come on.
As if we can go.

05:00.867 --> 05:04.030
There will be some emergency.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.637
See?

05:08.708 --> 05:11.208
Yours.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.807
Yeah?
Yeah, practice is over. Why?

05:15.815 --> 05:18.545
No, that wasn't gonna be me.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.652
What do you mean, Marky's sick?

05:20.653 --> 05:23.153
Weiss, come on, man.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.657
Okay. Okay.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.159
Goodbye.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.160
I have to go in.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.562
I'm gonna stay and practice so
I can kick your ass next time.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.691
- Don't forget. Santa Barbara.
- Yeah. Someday.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.170
# Ohhh #

05:38.171 --> 05:42.471
# I would bleed to love her #

05:46.979 --> 05:50.881
# And once again
she calls to me #

05:52.318 --> 05:55.014
# Then she vanishes
in thin air #

05:57.757 --> 06:01.693
# And how she takes
my breath away... #

06:17.944 --> 06:20.444
You received my intel.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.007
Your friend was cleared.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.218
I told you I'd want a favor.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.719
This is it.

06:30.356 --> 06:33.450
266 Kroner Strasse.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.360
In Zurich.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.763
I've given you the address
of Sloane's warehouse

06:37.764 --> 06:40.699
where he's hiding
the Rambaldi artifacts.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.469
That's not why you're here.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.872
Yes.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.535
It's the only reason.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.634
I know you're Lying.
But I don't know why.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.010
I'm here to help you.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.222
Stop being as stubborn as I am!

07:04.924 --> 07:08.951
I knew I'd turn myself in,
that I would betray the CIA.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.996
But not you.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.198
I had to be careful.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.963
I needed you to trust me.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.629
But I also couldn't tell you
my plan.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.238
Sloane had 23
Rambaldi artifacts.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.408
The CIA had 24.

07:23.409 --> 07:27.277
In order to assemble the device,
they had to be brought together.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.414
Those are in Sloane's warehouse.

07:29.415 --> 07:32.213
You stole Rambaldi pieces
from the U.S. government?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.453
Yes.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.083
By winning your trust,
the CIA's trust.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.717
And then, as planned,

07:40.793 --> 07:43.094
I had a proposal delivered
to Sloane.

07:43.095 --> 07:47.156
A proposal that we work together
to take down The Alliance

07:47.233 --> 07:50.293
and raid the CIA all at once.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.304
I came up with a scenario

07:52.305 --> 07:55.365
where the CIA needed to let me
use their computers.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.476
I used the opportunity to learn

07:57.477 --> 08:02.938
where the U.S. government kept
its stash of Rambaldi artifacts.

08:03.015 --> 08:06.542
They were being held
at a secret NSA lab in Nevada.

08:06.619 --> 08:10.612
One month later,
Sloane had a team raid the lab.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.691
I never heard of an NSA raid.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.392
Of course not.

08:14.393 --> 08:19.592
When the time came
for my escape, it was painful.

08:19.665 --> 08:23.192
Because my love for you,
for your father,

08:23.269 --> 08:25.670
was not a contrivance.

08:25.671 --> 08:29.072
Suddenly you want us to have
Sloane's artifacts?

08:29.141 --> 08:32.076
I know our relationship
is complicated.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.544
But I'm your mother.

08:33.546 --> 08:38.609
I have to believe that would be
the case under any circumstance.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.184
Go to Zurich.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.280
- You're insane.
- One more thing I need to do.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.856
And I'm sorry for this, too.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.205
Provacillium to the rescue.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.266
Thanks.
The fever's bad.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.710
So what are we doing
with Tippin?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.146
Nothing.
For the moment.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.215
Then when am I getting
extracted?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.450
I don't know what new evidence
the CIA has.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.579
- But it's gonna lead to me.
- Not necessarily.

09:15.655 --> 09:19.318
If you disappear now,
you'll be a suspect for sure.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.160
What is it?

09:32.171 --> 09:38.576
Allison, we can't reverse
the process.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.178
Markovic's lab was destroyed.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.284
But we're doing everything
we can to retrieve the data.

09:47.286 --> 09:48.853
And I'm hopeful

09:48.854 --> 09:52.017
that we will find a way
to reverse the procedure.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.292
- I may have to stay this way?
- No.

09:54.293 --> 09:55.794
No.
We'll get you back.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.896
Look at me.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.397
We'll get you back.

10:10.810 --> 10:14.211
You don't fancy him, do you?

10:15.481 --> 10:17.981
Tippin?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.784
Don't be stupid.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.423
And it didn't occur to you
that a raid...

10:35.501 --> 10:38.732
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the details of the raid.

10:38.838 --> 10:42.274
And I'm not at liberty to
respect the way you do business.

10:42.341 --> 10:45.435
How many Rambaldi pieces
were stolen?

10:45.544 --> 10:47.212
24?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.314
That's what my mother said.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.840
And we have to find out
from Irina Derevko?

10:51.917 --> 10:53.952
The question is,
what is the next step?

10:53.953 --> 10:57.320
She's Lying. She has to be.
It's a setup.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.157
Then why show up in person?

10:59.158 --> 11:02.753
From what I know of Derevko,
she's loyal to only one person.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.962
Herself.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.830
Dixon's right, obviously.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.233
I don't know.
Maybe this is a valid play.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.759
- But why would she need us?
- Guilt.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.237
Her motives may be insidious,
her methods loathsome,

11:14.306 --> 11:15.974
but she is not unfeeling.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.308
I say we send a team.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.144
Proceed with caution,
but proceed.

11:19.145 --> 11:22.581
We'll prep to have whatever we
find brought back to the States.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.015
A neutral location.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.184
I propose Evans Naval Base
in Ventura.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.286
- I'll call my director.
- You do that.

11:28.287 --> 11:31.552
Sloane may have most of the
pieces to assemble this device.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.525
But I don't think
he has them all.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.726
The di Regno heart.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.828
If the NSA's still got it.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.354
You know, that's enough
of your crap.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.492
Jack, go along with the NSA,
transfer the heart to the base,

11:42.568 --> 11:44.402
and let Marshall know
he's going.

11:44.403 --> 11:47.804
I want him to confirm
what we've got, or not, ASAP.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.240
Weiss, I need you to tell Tippin
we're done with him.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.074
- Escort him to the safe house.
- Yes, sir.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.149
Marshall, we're sending you
to Zurich.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.484
It's a research mission.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.420
We may have gained access
to Sloane's Rambaldi artifacts.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.856
That's fantastic.
I mean...

12:04.857 --> 12:07.792
Hey, you know who should go
with us on this mission?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.360
Carrie... Ms. Bowman...
because she's NSA,

12:10.429 --> 12:14.092
she works under Brandon,
and she would be very helpful

12:14.166 --> 12:15.734
in the field.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.302
In the field.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.803
Please?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.607
Ms. Bowman.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.608
Yes, sir?

12:23.609 --> 12:26.476
You're going to Zurich.
Plane leaves in an hour.

12:31.016 --> 12:34.349
Mr. Tippin, I'm Agent Weiss.
We're all through here.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.878
I'm supposed to take you
to where you'll be staying.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.991
Is there a computer
I can use here?

12:39.992 --> 12:43.428
The name on this DNA file,
I know that from somewhere.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.263
- I want to check it out.
- Sure.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.297
Thanks.
I'm Will.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.433
Oh. Weiss.
Eric Weiss.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.034
Like Houdini.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.669
Yeah.
Yeah, actually.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.139
He was a great-great-uncle
of mine.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.473
Can you do magic tricks?

12:55.474 --> 12:58.500
Okay, check this out.
Okay, you ready?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.014
A.G. Doren doesn't ring a bell?

13:03.015 --> 13:04.082
No. Still doesn't.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.351
Hey, can I access
my Tradeworks file?

13:06.352 --> 13:08.852
Yeah.
What's your password?

13:09.989 --> 13:11.122
Sydney.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.623
Oh.

13:13.726 --> 13:14.726
Thanks.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.457
There was a time I was
considering becoming a magician.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.294
Then I thought,
"What the hell am I thinking?"

13:20.366 --> 13:22.133
Oh, my God.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.835
What?

13:23.836 --> 13:26.271
- What's that list?
- Project: Christmas.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.435
It's a CIA black ops program
from the '70s.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.875
Train kids as sleeper agents
to be used as future spies.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.212
What?

13:34.213 --> 13:37.614
It's a summer camp.
There were 20 kids.

13:37.683 --> 13:41.175
Allison Doren was supposed to
have died in a car accident.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.431
This is Kendall.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.560
We've got the heart.
We're en route to the base.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.736
E.T.A.... three hours.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.237
Roger that.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.292
Let's go.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.099
Okay. We're free
of explosives. You can move in.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.680
- These could be real.
- Let's get Marshall in here.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.353
How is it looking?

14:48.354 --> 14:49.387
I don't know, sir.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.221
It's not consistent with any
of the artifacts I've seen.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.259
I was thinking the same thing.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.760
Well, what the hell is it?

14:59.365 --> 15:01.865
Looks like a waffle iron?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.549
It's a setup.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.050
There's nothing here.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.420
Give me Jack Bristow.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.738
Drop the weapon or you're dead.

15:56.522 --> 16:00.686
Irina Derevko has struck again.

16:00.759 --> 16:04.195
Based on her intel, we sent in
some of our finest agents.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.464
We took control
of a storage facility.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.900
With the help of a bomb squad,
we are in control

16:08.901 --> 16:11.529
of two dozen rusted
kitchen appliances.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.731
Simultaneously, an enemy team
ambushed our caravan,

16:14.840 --> 16:16.274
killed two of our men.

16:16.275 --> 16:19.733
And along with the di Regno
heart, Jack Bristow is missing.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.680
What's our next move?

16:22.681 --> 16:26.640
We scour every source of intel,
anything halfway concrete,

16:26.719 --> 16:29.219
and we move on it.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.004
He had so many
brilliant creations.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.742
Rambaldi.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.180
But there was one
in particular.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.182
A machine.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.584
He called it il dire.
"The telling. "

17:01.653 --> 17:05.214
The construction consists
of 47 pieces.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.290
Classic Rambaldi.

17:07.291 --> 17:11.422
As you know,
it took me a long time.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.997
Longer than I thought.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.300
But I've acquired them all...

17:16.300 --> 17:19.098
including the di Regno heart.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.872
With your help.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.373
They're in the next room, Jack.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.943
I have a team assembling
il dire right now.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.675
They say it shouldn't be
more than a day.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.249
And then what?

17:36.655 --> 17:40.751
I've seen things recently.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.326
I've seen what's possible.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.825
There's a change coming, Jack.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.460
Something even
I couldn't imagine.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.036
I used to feel sorry for you.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.270
Could you sense it?

17:57.342 --> 18:03.042
That you'd been abandoned,
left for dead, disgraced?

18:03.115 --> 18:05.516
I pitied you.

18:05.517 --> 18:10.250
That you needed Rambaldi
to fill the void in your life.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.853
It was like a religion for you.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.987
I didn't expect you
to understand.

18:19.064 --> 18:22.329
Then why keep me alive?

18:25.838 --> 18:28.466
Because we're friends, Jack.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.353
Any anomalies?

18:42.354 --> 18:43.855
Mnh-mnh.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.223
Were you close to him?
Brandon?

18:47.292 --> 18:49.026
I hated him.

18:49.027 --> 18:52.554
Which is why I feel so bad,
if that makes any sense.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.131
I'm sorry.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.670
You're sweet.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.940
I see.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.441
I see. No.
Actually, that helps a lot.

19:05.544 --> 19:08.138
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.348
What's up?

19:10.349 --> 19:12.416
This is A.G. Doren.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.519
Allison Doren.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.717
I just talked with her parents,
told them I was with NTSB.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.624
- Asked about the accident.
- And?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.692
There was a bus crash
and a fire.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.294
But the coroner told them

19:23.295 --> 19:26.162
that their daughter's burns
were severe.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.366
So they never identified
the body?

19:28.367 --> 19:29.867
No.

19:33.071 --> 19:33.871
Hello?

19:33.872 --> 19:36.397
I didn't know Sloane was
gonna switch crates.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.176
Where the hell are you?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.078
He must have known
I was going to double-cross him.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.246
He knew.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.514
I am gonna find you.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.015
I don't know where Sloane's
gone, but Sark does.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.652
It doesn't have to be you.

19:47.653 --> 19:51.248
Just make sure someone from
the CIA goes to Vel Smokander.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.724
Vel Smokander.
It's a club in Stockholm.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.228
Sark's gonna be there
at 10:00 tomorrow night.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.255
How stupid are you to think
I would believe you again?

20:00.332 --> 20:03.324
Ultimately you will do
whatever you want.

20:03.402 --> 20:06.701
That's what free will's
all about.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.281
I've got nothing.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.782
You?

20:23.355 --> 20:25.855
We're going to Sweden.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.385
Everyone's blond.
I keep thinking I see him.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.587
Sark's not here.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.088
As expected.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.158
Your dad's gonna be okay.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.796
I know.

21:09.901 --> 21:14.531
So, when this is over,
how do we go on vacation?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.308
Well, I was thinking.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.142
Yeah?

21:18.143 --> 21:21.579
And I was thinking that we
have to stop talking about it

21:21.647 --> 21:23.347
and just book the hotel.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.949
- Just do it.
- You're right.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.450
We have to start thinking
more positively.

21:27.486 --> 21:30.614
- We're going to Santa Barbara.
- We're going.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.724
There he is.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.700
I don't get it.

21:42.701 --> 21:43.901
What?

21:43.902 --> 21:45.803
My mother.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.304
Nothing.
Let's move.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.343
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

21:56.948 --> 22:01.044
See? When I have a gun on you,
I don't just pull the trigger.

22:01.119 --> 22:02.820
Thank you.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.989
You're welcome.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.490
Where the hell is my father?

22:08.126 --> 22:09.660
Not a problem.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.562
My loyalties are flexible.

22:12.631 --> 22:17.125
Sloane and your father
are in Mexico City.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.845
Base camp, we're at sublevel 2.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.613
They're in the basement.
Now what?

23:10.021 --> 23:14.754
The alarm system is located
20 yards down on the north wall.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.954
A gray box with a yellow stripe.

23:18.029 --> 23:21.624
The deactivation code is 11566.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.931
If this intel turns out
to be wrong,

23:25.036 --> 23:27.664
I will personally escort you
to Camp Harris.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.571
And I won't leave
until you're dead and buried.

23:30.642 --> 23:34.544
Then I certainly hope Mr. Sloane
hasn't changed the code.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.847
Mountaineer,
there's a gray control box

23:36.848 --> 23:40.511
with a yellow stripe
20 yards down on the north wall.

23:40.585 --> 23:45.454
You will enter 11566.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.959
Alpha team,
we've neutralized the alarm.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.795
You're go to enter the building.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.296
Move! Move!

23:57.502 --> 24:00.002
Move! Move!

24:00.138 --> 24:03.596
Jack, it's been assembled.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.749
Sir, there's a tactical team
heading up the stairs.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.687
Pack everything and go.
Go!

24:17.756 --> 24:20.256
We'll see each other
again, Jack.

24:29.601 --> 24:32.101
Jack!

24:32.370 --> 24:35.271
Tell Agent Bristow
I've got her father.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.208
The equipment is being loaded
onto the truck?

24:37.209 --> 24:39.709
Yes, sir.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.159
Go!

25:06.805 --> 25:09.305
Go after Sloane!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.508
You get Sloane.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.354
Freeze!

25:25.690 --> 25:28.784
I've shot you before.
I will do it again.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.360
Keep your hands in the air!

25:32.764 --> 25:34.765
I'm on the roof.
I've got Derevko.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.266
Roger that.

25:40.405 --> 25:42.905
Get off the ledge.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.544
I'll tell you
what you need to know.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.711
Get off the ledge.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.947
Sloane believes
he's been chosen

25:49.948 --> 25:52.712
to realize the word
of Rambaldi.

25:52.784 --> 25:56.220
But you, too, have been chosen.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.755
If you think I'm bluffing...

25:57.756 --> 26:01.487
It's you in the prophecy,
Sydney, not me.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.427
Only you can stop him.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.065
Good luck, sweetheart.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.893
Get down now.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.504
I love you.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.420
She jumped!

26:45.403 --> 26:47.738
Any available agents,
get to street level!

26:47.739 --> 26:50.239
I'm on my way.

26:54.746 --> 26:58.011
She just climbed into a floor
in the middle of the building.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.984
- Which floor?
- I have no idea!

26:59.985 --> 27:03.421
18th, maybe 19th!
I can't tell from here!

27:09.861 --> 27:12.361
- It's been almost two hours.
- Shh!

27:12.864 --> 27:14.665
Home base, we just found

27:14.666 --> 27:17.191
an elevator shaft pried open
on the 19th floor.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.768
We think Derevko has left
the building.

27:21.106 --> 27:24.542
Uh, sir, you're not supposed to
throw these like that.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.143
You'll break them.

27:36.788 --> 27:37.955
Hey.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.456
Hey.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.229
Any news?

27:45.230 --> 27:47.730
No.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.468
Just trying to
figure it all out.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.579
You're the best.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.682
I'm gonna get an aspirin.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.183
I'll be right back.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.405
You've reached
Sydney's cellphone.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.467
- Leave a message after the beep.
- Sydney, it's me. Listen.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.044
This is gonna sound insane,

29:07.045 --> 29:10.503
but I just found Provacillium
in the bathroom.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.983
And I think that...

29:12.984 --> 29:16.078
I think that, uh...
Okay. Just think about it.

29:16.154 --> 29:17.955
I think the double is Franc...

29:25.997 --> 29:28.497
Fran?

30:00.431 --> 30:02.931
It was always you?

30:05.670 --> 30:08.170
Allison?

30:08.339 --> 30:11.331
It sucks it turned out this way.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.644
That's it.
Get on the ground.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.145
Get on the ground!

30:58.356 --> 31:00.856
Sloane's got the device.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.590
And my mother, she...

31:05.730 --> 31:08.230
Another day.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.775
- So I did it.
- Did what?

31:18.776 --> 31:20.811
Booked the hotel.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.779
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.781
- Santa Barbara?
- Three nights.

31:24.782 --> 31:27.251
It was probably the greatest
phone call I ever made.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.752
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

31:30.154 --> 31:32.456
So after the debrief,
I'll pick you up.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.957
Okay.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.239
Hey.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.009
Hi.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.677
You okay?

31:53.678 --> 31:55.312
Relatively speaking.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.813
You?

31:58.483 --> 32:00.983
Tired.

32:04.222 --> 32:06.290
What's up?

32:06.291 --> 32:08.987
I am so burnt.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.560
I understand.

32:19.637 --> 32:22.137
You have two messages.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.207
Where's Will?

32:24.208 --> 32:25.208
I don't know.

32:25.209 --> 32:29.009
Hi. It's Mary Beth
from Director Kendall's office.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.580
Will said he had
something to do.

32:34.018 --> 32:36.543
Sydney, it's me. Listen.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.155
This is gonna sound insane,

32:38.156 --> 32:41.489
but I just found Provacillium
in the bathroom.

32:41.559 --> 32:44.221
And I think that...

32:44.295 --> 32:47.389
I think that, uh...
Okay. Just think about it.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.333
I think the double is Franc...

32:50.735 --> 32:53.235
End of messages.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.127
Want some?

33:21.065 --> 33:23.565
Sure.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.671
I just have to change
out of these clothes.

33:50.228 --> 33:52.728
I just remembered.

33:53.731 --> 33:57.167
Francie doesn't like
coffee ice cream.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.735
No, she doesn't.

34:01.272 --> 34:03.772
Drop the gun.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.075
Drop it!

38:21.032 --> 38:23.033
Dispatch.

38:23.034 --> 38:27.198
This is officer 2300844
calling for connection.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.206
Confirmation.
Looking glass.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.500
Stand by.

38:33.611 --> 38:34.778
This is Kendall.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.113
I just woke up in Hong Kong.

38:37.114 --> 38:41.448
I don't know how long I've
been here or how I got here.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.021
Hello?

38:45.022 --> 38:49.823
Get to our safe house
in Tsimshatsui.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.394
You remember how to get there?

38:52.396 --> 38:53.730
Of course I do.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.231
I'll make sure
they're expecting you.

38:57.301 --> 38:59.801
Okay.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.713
Have they said...

39:11.782 --> 39:15.309
Have they said anything
about how I got here?

39:15.386 --> 39:17.980
They've asked you to wait
for information

39:18.055 --> 39:20.751
until your contact arrives.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.960
They doubled Francie.

39:56.961 --> 39:57.994
I know.

39:57.995 --> 40:01.055
What happened to Will?
To Francie? Are they dead?

40:01.132 --> 40:03.632
Will's okay.

40:03.634 --> 40:06.728
What? How?

40:06.837 --> 40:09.337
You...

40:10.674 --> 40:13.174
Sit down.

40:28.793 --> 40:31.293
Vaughn?

40:36.066 --> 40:38.566
We thought you were dead.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.311
They asked me to come back to...

40:51.182 --> 40:52.315
To explain.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.816
Come back from what?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.453
What are you talking about?

41:00.391 --> 41:02.891
Vaughn...

41:04.595 --> 41:07.428
Why are you wearing that ring?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.801
Syd...

41:15.840 --> 41:18.570
Since that night...

41:19.977 --> 41:22.477
...you were missing.

41:30.788 --> 41:34.280
You've been missing
for almost two years.
