Oh, yeah. OK, Duck.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.360

04:21.480 --> 04:23.480

04:27.720 --> 04:31.600
Hardly seems worth destroying, does it?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.240
Quack...

04:36.280 --> 04:41.120
- Quack.
- Oh, hello, Duck. Want to window watch?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.480
Can't you just like the window?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.600
Oh, dear. Is it broken?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.720
- Quack, quack!
- It's not broken.
- Quack.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.240
- It's sick!
- Oh.
- Needs medicine.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.600
See, Duck? He's all better now.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.680
- Duck?
- Better go find him.
- Hmm.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.120

- Huh?

05:52.400 --> 05:55.800
He just needs his friend back.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.200
- I'd listen to her if I were you.
- Hmm.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.080
You really shouldn't do everything your Auto Cat wants.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.440
- Mine's off at the moment.
- Oh!

06:08.440 --> 06:12.000
