00:01.213 --> 00:02.444
The Carmichael Show is taped

00:02.445 --> 00:04.142
in front of a live studio audience.

00:04.143 --> 00:05.540
Happy Birthday.

00:05.621 --> 00:07.756
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.692
- Mm.
- Mwah!

00:09.693 --> 00:13.362
So you already opened the gift I got you.

00:13.363 --> 00:15.130
Yeah.

00:15.131 --> 00:17.733
I didn't want you to have the
pressure of watching me open it,

00:17.734 --> 00:19.034
in case I didn't like it.

00:20.904 --> 00:22.503
All right, how do you like it?

00:23.739 --> 00:25.007
You gift-paused.

00:25.008 --> 00:26.208
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

00:26.209 --> 00:27.443
No. Uh, uh,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.144
Maxine, I think you're a very beautiful,

00:29.145 --> 00:31.647
thoughtful girlfriend, really... but...

00:31.648 --> 00:33.581
come on... Banana Republic, Maxine?

00:34.783 --> 00:36.285
I mean, do I look like a guy

00:36.286 --> 00:38.046
that works in Accounting,
named Adam, to you?

00:38.522 --> 00:39.588
Okay, I think their demographic

00:39.589 --> 00:41.223
is slightly larger than that.

00:41.224 --> 00:43.158
Or a young dad named Chris?

00:43.159 --> 00:44.326
Now you're just naming people you know

00:44.327 --> 00:45.461
who wear Banana Republic.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.695
I'm not an assistant principal

00:46.696 --> 00:48.464
named Markel, Maxine.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.733
Where are you even
getting these names from?

00:50.734 --> 00:52.234
Okay, look, since it's your birthday,

00:52.235 --> 00:54.203
I thought we could do something fun today

00:54.204 --> 00:56.438
like check out that new Italian food cart.

00:56.439 --> 00:58.707
You want me to eat on the streets?

00:58.708 --> 01:00.476
- For my birthday?
- Okay,

01:00.477 --> 01:02.077
but the guy who opened it

01:02.078 --> 01:04.212
almost made it onto Top Chef Boston.

01:04.214 --> 01:05.214
That doesn't count.

01:05.215 --> 01:06.615
Nobody goes to Boston for the food.

01:06.616 --> 01:08.417
You go for there for
the enthusiastic racism.

01:08.418 --> 01:11.086
All right? Look, look,
sit down... sit down.

01:11.087 --> 01:12.955
- Okay.
- All right, so...

01:12.956 --> 01:15.257
First, we are... thank you...

01:15.258 --> 01:17.459
going to watch Coming to America

01:17.460 --> 01:18.727
while we sip hot chocolate.

01:18.728 --> 01:20.329
Ooh, I heard that's pretty funny.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.097
What do you mean, you
heard it's pretty funny?

01:22.098 --> 01:23.432
Yeah, I heard it's funny.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.168
No, no, no... you hear the
Guggenheim has great exhibits.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.071
You hear HPV is more
dangerous than you thought.

01:29.072 --> 01:30.639
You... see

01:30.640 --> 01:32.007
Coming to America.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.876
Okay. And then what else are we gonna do?

01:33.877 --> 01:35.177
And then,

01:35.178 --> 01:37.646
we go to my parents' house
for my surprise party.

01:37.647 --> 01:39.848
Okay, how is it a surprise,
if you already know about it?

01:39.849 --> 01:42.084
Oh, no, I need to know about
my surprises, all right?

01:42.085 --> 01:44.053
Otherwise they're just too startling.

01:44.054 --> 01:46.388
But then we, uh, we eat some cake

01:46.389 --> 01:47.856
and then my parents sing to me.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.659
Oh, well, I can sing you the birthday song.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.429
♪ Happy birthday ♪

01:53.430 --> 01:57.232

02:00.136 --> 02:02.370

02:07.610 --> 02:10.479
- Happy birthday, playboy.
- Oh, thank you.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.880
Did y'all hear what happened?

02:11.881 --> 02:14.149
The cops shot a unarmed teenager downtown.

02:14.150 --> 02:15.751
And I'm going down there to protest.

02:15.752 --> 02:17.486
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

02:17.487 --> 02:19.021
I know. Look, this is
the worst possible day

02:19.022 --> 02:21.155
I could start my new job.

02:24.393 --> 02:25.894
I don't know... I'm torn, too, man.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.163
I don't know if I'd go
down there, take the streets

02:28.164 --> 02:29.698
and fight because I'm a black youth...

02:29.699 --> 02:32.401
or do I defend the force, you know?

02:32.402 --> 02:35.103
Because, you know, I'm a officer now.

02:35.638 --> 02:37.406
Okay.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.975
You're a 32-year-old man
who works security part-time

02:39.976 --> 02:42.277
at an electronics store.

02:42.278 --> 02:44.513
You're not a youth, you're not an officer,

02:44.514 --> 02:46.647
and neither side wants you, man.

02:47.516 --> 02:48.751
Okay, forget you, okay?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.219
Matter of fact, is that your sweater?

02:50.220 --> 02:51.487
This sweater's ugly.

02:51.488 --> 02:53.355
What, you're a architect named Pete?

02:53.356 --> 02:55.391
Okay. Ha-ha.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.459
Listen, I think that we
should go down and protest.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.695
'Cause, you know, I tried
to go to Occupy Wall Street

02:59.696 --> 03:01.830
but my flight landed
when the protest ended,

03:01.831 --> 03:04.732
so I just saw Book of
Mormon twice and went home.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.070
That's the saddest story
I've ever heard before.

03:08.071 --> 03:09.505
But no, I'm not

03:09.506 --> 03:11.774
gonna go protest. Nobody
should go protest...

03:11.775 --> 03:13.242
it doesn't do anything.

03:13.243 --> 03:15.010
You know those people
that, like, stand outside

03:15.011 --> 03:16.679
- the White House with picket signs?
- Mm-hmm.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.547
Just completely wasting their time.

03:18.548 --> 03:21.016
They are not wasting their time.

03:21.017 --> 03:22.451
People protested for gay marriage

03:22.452 --> 03:24.520
in front of the White
House and that worked out.

03:24.521 --> 03:25.854
You really gonna credit that to protests?

03:25.855 --> 03:29.157
That was more Neil Patrick
Harris than anything.

03:30.025 --> 03:31.860
Look, I'm going down there.

03:31.861 --> 03:33.729
Come on Bobby, I'm gonna give
you a ride halfway to work

03:33.730 --> 03:36.598
and you can walk the rest of the way.

03:36.599 --> 03:38.766

03:59.546 --> 04:01.764
I feel like we should be at the protest.

04:01.765 --> 04:04.533
Okay, look. I'm willing to negotiate.

04:04.534 --> 04:06.689
We'll go in here now and
after I blow out the candles

04:06.690 --> 04:09.125
I'll make a little wish that
black people not get shot

04:09.126 --> 04:11.327
by the police nearly as often, okay?

04:11.328 --> 04:12.795
All right, if you'll excuse me,

04:12.796 --> 04:15.364
we have a surprise party to attend.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.334
- Surprise!
- Oh!

04:19.470 --> 04:21.070
Oh! Oh!

04:21.071 --> 04:22.105
Oh, my God.

04:22.106 --> 04:23.573
Oh, you got me good this year.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.354
We live in a time where

04:44.355 --> 04:45.528
the police can indiscriminately...

04:45.529 --> 04:47.697
I know what it means, Maxine.

04:47.698 --> 04:51.501
But why are you wearing
that on my baby's birthday?

04:51.502 --> 04:55.004
Well, the police shot an
unarmed man in West Charlotte

04:55.005 --> 04:56.739
and people are protesting downtown.

04:56.740 --> 04:57.941
Oh... It's so exciting

04:57.942 --> 04:59.776
to see all our people down there.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.512
Voices are being heard,
change is happening...

05:02.513 --> 05:05.247
Do you always get this giddy
when somebody gets shot?

05:07.183 --> 05:09.185
You guys, let's not
talk about this anymore.

Let's get back to the song.

05:10.421 --> 05:12.388

05:12.389 --> 05:13.690
Oh, come on, y'all.

- Jerrod, hush. This is important.
- Yes, I was

05:16.026 --> 05:17.226
trying to explain to him earlier.

05:17.227 --> 05:19.162
It's our generation's chance to be heard.

05:19.163 --> 05:21.698
You know, here in Charlotte,
you are four times more likely

05:21.699 --> 05:23.466
to be arrested if you're black than white.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.368
Oh, Joe, I don't like those numbers.

05:25.369 --> 05:27.570
Oh, no, no, no.

05:27.571 --> 05:28.771
Slow down.

05:28.772 --> 05:30.773
I hope you're not thinking
about going out there.

05:30.774 --> 05:33.910
Protests are filled with
too much sexual energy.

05:33.911 --> 05:35.278
What?!

05:35.279 --> 05:36.813
That's right. I don't need

05:36.814 --> 05:39.782
my wife around all those
rebellious black men.

05:39.783 --> 05:42.585
Protests make you sexy. It's a fact.

05:42.586 --> 05:45.254
That is just not a fact.

05:45.255 --> 05:46.689
Okay, think about it:

05:46.690 --> 05:49.792
Without protests, Malcolm X was a four.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.894
Malcolm X was a ginger.

05:51.895 --> 05:53.629
The man was a black ginger

05:53.630 --> 05:56.032
and nobody even noticed.

05:56.033 --> 05:58.368
Oh, he's just talking nonsense.

05:58.369 --> 05:59.836
I loved protesting.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.772
Oh, the electricity in the air.

06:02.773 --> 06:05.341
The smell of change on the horizon.

06:05.342 --> 06:08.277
The sounds of civil rights hymns.

06:13.117 --> 06:14.350
See, this is what I'm talking about.

06:14.351 --> 06:17.053
Now they're getting all worked up.

06:18.155 --> 06:20.123
Yeah, Cynthia. Oh!

06:20.124 --> 06:21.958
You know, I'm inspired
by all that stuff, too.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.593
I'm inspired by your generation,

06:23.594 --> 06:25.128
who laid the groundwork for mine.

06:25.129 --> 06:28.097
I almost miss the inequality of the '60s,

06:28.098 --> 06:30.867
I loved protesting that much.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.201
Mm-hmm.

06:32.202 --> 06:33.536
You know, Maxine is right...

06:33.537 --> 06:35.805
these young people need to get out there

06:35.806 --> 06:38.508
and stand up for what they believe in.

06:38.509 --> 06:40.633
I don't think anybody
needs to be out there.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.310
Thank you.

06:41.311 --> 06:42.745
No, I watched the news this morning.

06:42.746 --> 06:44.247
We don't have all the facts.

06:44.248 --> 06:45.748
Now, I've seen plenty of these protests,

06:45.749 --> 06:46.983
and I'm just gonna say this:

06:46.984 --> 06:48.951
sometimes black people

06:48.952 --> 06:51.421
have a tendency to jump to conclusions.

06:51.422 --> 06:53.723
Jump to conclusions?!

06:53.724 --> 06:54.857
Well, look at you.

06:54.858 --> 06:56.359
You read a damn T-shirt,

06:56.360 --> 06:57.727
now you're encouraging Maxine

06:57.728 --> 06:59.395
- to go out there and protest.
- Yeah,

06:59.396 --> 07:00.997
yeah, yeah, and she's,
like, ready to ignore

07:00.998 --> 07:03.533
her son's birthday. You haven't
even seen the news story yet.

07:03.534 --> 07:06.002
The sad part is I don't have to see it.

07:06.003 --> 07:07.070
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, okay,

07:07.071 --> 07:08.538
you know, I will say that sometimes

07:08.539 --> 07:10.273
there's a legitimate reason to protest.

07:10.274 --> 07:12.408
But sometimes I say to myself,

07:12.409 --> 07:14.644
"Why are they running from
the cops in the first place?"

07:14.645 --> 07:16.145
- Joe!
- What?

07:16.146 --> 07:17.180
I mean, you think just because

07:17.181 --> 07:18.414
he's black, he's innocent?

07:18.415 --> 07:20.216
What? I'm just being honest

07:20.217 --> 07:21.217
about how I feel.

07:21.218 --> 07:22.485
I thought I was in a safe place.

07:22.486 --> 07:23.618
Okay.

07:27.123 --> 07:29.625
No matter what he did, he was unarmed.

07:29.626 --> 07:31.294
So we need to make sure that people

07:31.295 --> 07:32.962
are held accountable for their actions.

07:32.963 --> 07:34.831
And that's why we should
be down there, Jerrod.

07:34.832 --> 07:36.499
So you really think protesting
makes people accountable

07:36.500 --> 07:38.367
- for their actions?
- Yes.

07:38.368 --> 07:39.869
Okay, then why did I see George Zimmerman

07:39.870 --> 07:41.104
at a Dave and Busters, Maxine?

07:41.105 --> 07:42.839
At a Dave and Busters!

07:42.840 --> 07:45.942
You did not see George
Zimmerman at Dave and Busters.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.210
Well, I could have.

07:47.211 --> 07:48.678
He's free enough to do it.

07:48.679 --> 07:51.180
I mean... all I'm saying
is this: like, people got

07:51.181 --> 07:53.950
all up in arms after Trayvon
died, and George Zimmerman's

07:53.951 --> 07:55.918
now running around the
country and is probably

07:55.919 --> 07:59.554
gonna be Donald Trump's
running mate for president.

08:01.224 --> 08:03.759
Well, that is why I'm going down there.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.895
I can hear the bells of justice ringing

08:05.896 --> 08:07.497
and I'm answering the call.

08:07.498 --> 08:09.832
Maxine,

08:09.833 --> 08:12.802
I'm gonna show you how to protest.

08:12.803 --> 08:14.871
Yeah! Me and Cynthia.

08:14.872 --> 08:16.272
Me and the Cynth.

08:16.273 --> 08:17.607
Making change.

08:17.608 --> 08:19.542
Making change and taking names.

08:19.543 --> 08:21.710
Uh... Ah, ah, ah! Young lady...

08:23.646 --> 08:25.414
Joe...

08:25.415 --> 08:26.883
I'm going upstairs to change

08:26.884 --> 08:30.018
into my civil rights clothes.

08:33.322 --> 08:35.158
Yeah, well, if somebody hits on you,

08:35.159 --> 08:37.292
it's gonna be another black man shot.

08:40.263 --> 08:42.698
Man, it is pandemonium out there.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.534
Oh, it's, like, thousands
of people out there, man.

08:44.535 --> 08:46.369
It is crazy. I mean, they
called the National Guard.

08:46.370 --> 08:48.104
Well, you know, Mom

08:48.105 --> 08:49.672
and Maxine are going out there, too.

08:49.673 --> 08:51.207
Uh-uh. Y'all need to be careful, man.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.109
Things are escalating real fast down there.

08:53.110 --> 08:55.244
Man, in fact, I hear they rioting, too.

08:55.245 --> 08:57.280
That's just the media. They always do this.

08:57.281 --> 08:58.981
They just find a couple
looters and make it seem like

08:58.982 --> 09:00.850
that's the entire scene, when in fact,

09:00.851 --> 09:03.586
a majority of the people
are protesting peacefully.

09:15.898 --> 09:17.600
Happy birthday, Jerrod.

09:17.601 --> 09:19.367
Got you a TV, man.

09:20.670 --> 09:22.038
Whoa!

09:22.039 --> 09:23.639
I am thirsty. I got to
get something to drink.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.342
I've been protesting all morning.

09:30.079 --> 09:31.847
Okay...

09:31.848 --> 09:33.482
so...

09:33.483 --> 09:35.651
do you guys think that she's one of the...

09:35.652 --> 09:37.186
peaceful protesters?

09:37.187 --> 09:38.421
Oh... Come on.

09:38.422 --> 09:39.755
You don't think that she would...

09:39.756 --> 09:41.857
Oh, no, that's exactly what I think.

09:41.858 --> 09:43.326
Okay, Bobby, you were married to her...

09:43.327 --> 09:45.394
- you don't...
- Yeah, she definitely did that.

09:45.395 --> 09:46.796
All right, well,

09:46.797 --> 09:49.432
- I'm gonna have to ask her.
- No, you can't ask her.

09:49.433 --> 09:51.232
I got $50 says she did it.

09:54.503 --> 09:55.471
Mmm.

09:55.472 --> 09:58.274
Oh, Nekeisha was thirsty.

09:58.275 --> 10:00.176
Hey... hey, Nekeisha, come here, sit down.

10:00.177 --> 10:02.912
Sit right here. Sit right here, Nekeisha.

10:02.913 --> 10:04.981
Hey. Um...

10:04.982 --> 10:07.216
there's no easy way

10:07.217 --> 10:10.720
of asking this, but, um...

10:10.721 --> 10:12.887
did you loot that TV?

10:14.290 --> 10:17.192
Are you asking me if I stole this TV?

10:19.061 --> 10:21.030
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,

10:21.031 --> 10:23.199
I'm asking if you stole the TV.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.700
Well, I'm offended.

10:24.701 --> 10:27.570
I did not steal that TV.

10:27.571 --> 10:29.538
Oh, my God. 'Cause I was like, "What?"

10:29.539 --> 10:30.840
Yeah, me, too.

10:30.841 --> 10:32.475
- Me, too... me, too.
- Got me.

10:32.476 --> 10:34.609
It was already stolen when I stole it.

10:35.478 --> 10:37.580
Come on.

10:37.581 --> 10:39.181
Damn it, I knew it!

10:39.182 --> 10:41.817
What? I took it from a looter.
If anything, I rescued this TV.

10:41.818 --> 10:43.219
Oh, come on.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.155
You know I can't take a
stolen television, Nekeisha.

10:46.156 --> 10:48.591
But I stole it from the bottom of my heart.

10:48.592 --> 10:51.761
You know something, Nekeisha,
this TV is going back.

10:51.762 --> 10:53.729
I cannot be an officer of the law and
let this happen... it's going back.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.331
- You aren't no officer of the law.
- I am an officer of the law!

10:55.332 --> 10:57.566
- You're a mall security guard!
- No, I got a badge.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.035
- No, man, you don't even have a gun.
- I got mace!

10:59.036 --> 11:00.269
You just got a flashlight, man.

11:00.270 --> 11:01.604
You ain't the boss of me!

11:01.605 --> 11:03.772
Okay, let's do this!

11:09.512 --> 11:12.647
Don't you walk out my house
looking that good, girl.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.052
Oh, wow, you look amazing.

11:16.053 --> 11:18.154
You have to look good so
when they treat you bad,

11:18.155 --> 11:19.821
makes them look worse.

11:21.023 --> 11:22.958
That's Protest 101.

11:22.959 --> 11:27.363
Oh, and you need to
have uncomfortable shoes.

11:27.364 --> 11:28.931
You wearing those?

11:28.932 --> 11:31.499
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.
They're-they're wedges.

11:34.503 --> 11:36.605
All right, fine.

11:36.606 --> 11:38.274
Come on, Maxine, let's go.

11:38.275 --> 11:39.675
Yeah. Let's go...

11:39.676 --> 11:41.243
make a difference.

11:41.244 --> 11:42.712
Come on, C Pound.

11:42.713 --> 11:44.846
You know, you're trying too hard, Maxine.

11:46.682 --> 11:49.185
Well, forget about my birthday!

11:49.186 --> 11:50.853
Well, you're getting too damn old

11:50.854 --> 11:52.288
for your birthday anyway, son.

11:52.289 --> 11:55.257
Welcome to being an adult.

11:55.258 --> 11:58.494
Nobody cares if you die,
nobody cares if you age,

11:58.495 --> 12:00.396
and I didn't get you a gift.

12:05.152 --> 12:05.852
_ _

12:15.017 --> 12:16.267
What's wrong, son?

12:16.752 --> 12:17.704
You all worked up

12:17.705 --> 12:19.439
'cause nobody's celebrating your birthday?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.141
Well, I'm gonna tell you

12:21.142 --> 12:23.777
the story of the day of your birth.

12:23.778 --> 12:25.372
Now, first of all, let me just say,

12:25.373 --> 12:27.066
a lot of people have the misconception

12:27.067 --> 12:29.903
that a miracle cannot be disgusting.

12:29.904 --> 12:31.404
Right.

12:31.405 --> 12:34.207
Why did Mom and Maxine have
to go out there now, you know?

12:34.208 --> 12:35.408
It's not like

12:35.409 --> 12:37.477
two more protestors are gonna end racism.

12:37.478 --> 12:38.645
So you're angry.

12:38.646 --> 12:40.547
No, I'm not angry! I...

12:40.548 --> 12:42.048
I just don't understand

12:42.049 --> 12:44.918
why someone had to get shot on my birthday.

12:44.919 --> 12:47.487
I get it.

12:47.488 --> 12:49.588
It's shocking.

12:50.456 --> 12:51.724
But this is nothing new.

12:51.725 --> 12:53.793
This has been going on for a long time.

12:53.794 --> 12:55.461
Nothing surprises me anymore.

12:55.462 --> 12:56.930
Shoot, I was there

12:56.931 --> 12:59.032
when Ozzie Osborne bit
the head off that pigeon.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.833
Oh, I've seen a lot.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.468
Look, I-I know it's not new.

13:02.469 --> 13:04.938
I mean, look, being young
and black in America...

13:04.939 --> 13:06.573
you're gonna get stopped by the cops.

13:06.574 --> 13:07.941
You know, it's like jury duty.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.509
Sometimes your number's gonna be up.

13:09.510 --> 13:11.044
Oh... just the other week, right,

13:11.045 --> 13:12.946
I was out getting a cup of coffee.

13:12.947 --> 13:14.781
What kind of coffee?

13:14.782 --> 13:16.049
Why does that matter?

13:16.050 --> 13:17.684
I'm a visual thinker, Jerrod.

13:17.685 --> 13:18.651
Okay. Fine.

13:18.652 --> 13:19.686
Iced coffee.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.287
Thank you. Now I can see it.

13:21.288 --> 13:23.356
Okay. So I was out getting iced coffee,

13:23.357 --> 13:25.458
and then, out of nowhere,
these four cops came,

13:25.459 --> 13:26.859
and they pulled guns on me,

13:26.860 --> 13:28.695
and they forced me down to the ground,

13:28.696 --> 13:30.196
and they handcuffed me, and I, like,

13:30.197 --> 13:32.465
had a mark on my face from
it hitting the sidewalk.

13:32.466 --> 13:33.800
You know, and, uh,

13:33.801 --> 13:37.003
you know, it was all
because I fit a description.

13:37.004 --> 13:38.972
Look, son...

13:38.973 --> 13:41.574
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

13:41.575 --> 13:43.109
But let me ask you something.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.744
Do you recall what you were wearing

13:44.745 --> 13:46.479
when you got stopped by the cops?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.849
- Why does it matter what I was wearing?
- Just answer the question.

13:49.850 --> 13:53.319
- A hoody, if you must know.
- Bingo.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.587
What do you mean, "Bingo"?

13:54.588 --> 13:56.422
Now, one more question:
How were you walking?

13:56.423 --> 13:58.091
- What do you mean, how was I walking?
- Yeah.

13:58.092 --> 14:00.259
Get up right now and show me your walk.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.094
Are you kidding me?

14:01.095 --> 14:02.228
No, I'm not kidding you.

14:02.229 --> 14:03.363
Go on.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.631
Are we really gonna do this?

14:04.632 --> 14:05.932
We are really gonna do this.

14:05.933 --> 14:07.467
Fine, I'll show you my walk.

14:07.468 --> 14:08.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:08.702 --> 14:10.103
What?!

14:10.104 --> 14:12.605
That is one suspicious
walk you got there, son.

14:12.606 --> 14:14.307
You always walk like that?

14:14.308 --> 14:16.009
It's my walk. It's how I walk.

14:16.010 --> 14:18.077
Well, I'm your father
and I'd never shoot you,

14:18.078 --> 14:20.813
but that is one aggressive stroll you got.

14:20.814 --> 14:22.714
I blame it on the hip-hop.

14:23.983 --> 14:25.585
You know what I'm starting to realize?

14:25.586 --> 14:26.819
I'm starting to realize

14:26.820 --> 14:28.721
it's just that type of prejudiced thinking

14:28.722 --> 14:30.957
that got me stopped by the
cops in the first place.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.525
No, this is the kind of thinking

14:32.526 --> 14:34.060
that's kept me safe all these years.

14:34.061 --> 14:36.062
I prejudge, Jerrod.

14:36.063 --> 14:37.263
I'm not prejudiced,

14:37.264 --> 14:40.398
but I will prejudge your behind like hell.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.369
That's how you get through life, huh?

14:43.370 --> 14:45.338
It's the only way to get through life.

14:45.339 --> 14:49.308
I'm only telling you this,
son, to keep you safe.

14:49.309 --> 14:50.877
She still loves me.

14:50.878 --> 14:53.379
No, I don't.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.415
Look, somebody tried to hit
me in the head with a bottle,

14:55.416 --> 14:56.816
and Nekeisha caught it before it hit me.

14:56.817 --> 14:59.686
I thought there was beer still in it.

14:59.687 --> 15:02.288
You saved my life.

15:02.289 --> 15:05.925
We all have our regrets.

15:07.695 --> 15:09.195
Give me a second.

15:09.196 --> 15:10.430
I was running very fast. Oh.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.298
Catch your breath. Catch your breath, baby.

15:12.299 --> 15:13.800
- Catch your breath.
- Oh. Oh.

15:13.801 --> 15:14.901
Are you okay? Where's Maxine?

15:14.902 --> 15:16.069
The police...

15:16.070 --> 15:18.037
they put out a city-wide curfew.

15:18.038 --> 15:19.372
Okay. And...?

15:19.373 --> 15:21.507
The cops came, and we all ran.

15:21.508 --> 15:23.076
Okay, but where's Maxine, Ma?

15:23.077 --> 15:25.378
I'm telling you... this generation...

15:25.379 --> 15:28.815
they have no idea how to protest.

15:28.816 --> 15:30.583
It was chaos.

15:30.584 --> 15:33.519
Everybody yelling,
people selling T-shirts...

15:33.520 --> 15:35.154
there were food carts.

15:35.155 --> 15:38.191
It was like a street festival out there.

15:38.192 --> 15:39.659
Oh, which reminds me:

15:39.660 --> 15:42.727
I brought you that Mexican corn you like.

15:44.464 --> 15:46.032
Okay, yeah, but, Ma, where's Maxine?

15:46.033 --> 15:48.634
There was a DJ down there.

15:48.635 --> 15:50.636
You don't play music

15:50.637 --> 15:53.673
on a laptop at a protest!

15:53.674 --> 15:55.274
You sing!

15:55.275 --> 15:56.943
Everybody knows that.

15:56.944 --> 15:58.611
That's right. Show 'em how it's done, baby.

16:36.683 --> 16:38.484
She done came back a 15!

16:38.485 --> 16:39.919
Look at you.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.588
The sweat of justice
dripping off your forehead.

16:42.589 --> 16:44.690
I'm coming in, baby.

16:44.691 --> 16:47.693
Stop. Stop. Ma, Ma, Ma... Maxine!

16:47.694 --> 16:49.228
Maxine! Where is she?

16:49.229 --> 16:50.463
- Oh, her?
- Yes.

16:50.464 --> 16:51.898
Yes. Her.

16:51.899 --> 16:53.199
She got arrested.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.867
What?!

16:54.868 --> 16:58.771
You mean they're rounding
up white people now, too?

16:58.772 --> 17:00.973
And-and you just left her?
She okay? Where is she?

17:00.974 --> 17:03.209
I had to. You should have seen

17:03.210 --> 17:05.744
how easy it was for the
police to pick her up.

17:05.746 --> 17:09.048
You got to make that girl eat more.

17:09.049 --> 17:11.651
Damn!

17:11.652 --> 17:12.952
He mad.

17:12.953 --> 17:14.554
I know. Look at him. He's pissed.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.656
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little
pissed, okay? All right?

17:16.656 --> 17:18.156
My mom ignored my birthday,

17:18.157 --> 17:20.292
I was racially profiled by my father,

17:20.294 --> 17:21.493
and now my girlfriend's in jail.

17:21.494 --> 17:22.862
So, yes, I'm a little bit pissed.

17:22.863 --> 17:26.732
Oh, honey! Jerrod!

17:26.733 --> 17:28.734
Oh... Jerrod, baby, listen!

17:28.735 --> 17:30.436
I'm sorry

17:30.437 --> 17:33.472
about your girlfriend,
but you got to tell her...

17:33.473 --> 17:36.274
you can't wear wedges to a protest.

17:37.777 --> 17:39.712
You can't run in those.

17:39.713 --> 17:41.013
Thanks, Ma.

17:41.014 --> 17:43.049
I'll be sure to pass that along.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.183
He all right.

17:46.485 --> 17:47.954
Can't believe that I did it.

17:47.955 --> 17:49.555
I was there.

17:49.556 --> 17:52.625
I didn't hear about it, I didn't
see it on TV, or read about it.

17:52.626 --> 17:54.827
I had handcuffs on.

17:54.828 --> 17:56.929
Well, actually they were
just little twist-ties,

17:56.930 --> 18:00.466
but still, I was arrested
protesting like Rosa Parks.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.301
All right, all right, relax.

18:02.302 --> 18:04.937
Pretty sure Rosa didn't
stop by a Steak and Shake

18:04.938 --> 18:07.373
on the way home from jail.

18:07.374 --> 18:10.009
You know, I had no idea
your mom could hop a fence.

18:10.010 --> 18:11.077
Mm.

18:11.078 --> 18:14.313
All right, I, uh... I got you something.

18:14.314 --> 18:17.817
And I know you don't like
surprises, so, it's a hamburger.

18:17.818 --> 18:20.786
Thank you. Appreciate it.

18:20.787 --> 18:23.389
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you on your birthday.

18:23.390 --> 18:26.259
I don't want you to think it
was just about my birthday.

18:26.260 --> 18:27.727
You know? I'm not that selfish.

18:29.062 --> 18:31.631
I, uh, was talking to my father,

18:31.632 --> 18:34.634
and, uh, he made me realize

18:34.635 --> 18:36.569
that this whole thing hits a little...

18:36.570 --> 18:39.138
closer to home than I
care to admit, you know?

18:39.139 --> 18:40.506
I mean,

18:40.507 --> 18:42.508
that kid could've been me, Maxine.

18:42.509 --> 18:44.844
And I know you think
that protesting goes out

18:44.845 --> 18:47.013
and solves the problem, but I don't know.

18:47.014 --> 18:51.182
This is something I have to
deal with every single day.

18:52.018 --> 18:54.152
You know I'm black, right?

19:05.064 --> 19:06.264
Eh.

19:09.602 --> 19:11.671
Honey, I know this is hard,

19:11.672 --> 19:14.974
but I'm so glad that
you're opening up about it.

19:14.975 --> 19:16.909
You know, we can do
something about it together.

19:16.910 --> 19:19.712
Oh, it can be something
that we do every birthday.

19:19.713 --> 19:21.447
Fighting for change.

19:21.448 --> 19:23.349
Me and J-Man...

19:23.350 --> 19:26.652
taking names and fighting on birthdays.

19:26.653 --> 19:30.122
We really got to work on
your nicknames, Maxine.

19:30.123 --> 19:32.992
I'm glad you're home safe.

19:32.993 --> 19:35.127
Mm. Me, too.

19:35.128 --> 19:38.097
And... I'm glad I get to spend

19:38.098 --> 19:39.832
the rest of my birthday

19:39.833 --> 19:42.702
lying next to the woman I love.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.869
Mm.

19:53.646 --> 19:54.880
Hey, Maxine?

19:54.881 --> 19:56.682
Hey,

19:56.683 --> 19:59.251
before you get in the
bed, you want to maybe

19:59.252 --> 20:01.953
hop in the shower, get
all that prison off of you?

20:03.022 --> 20:04.289
No!

20:05.157 --> 20:07.492
Come on!

20:08.722 --> 20:09.422
_ _

20:10.852 --> 20:13.955
Okay, let's see it.

20:13.956 --> 20:15.957
Yeah. Okay.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.040
- What?!
- I never noticed that before.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.909
I didn't raise you to
walk like that, Jerrod.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.410
What you talking about? No.

20:21.411 --> 20:23.513
All right, there is
nothing wrong with my walk.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.747
It's just how I walk.

20:24.748 --> 20:25.948
No, dude, you look like you're about

20:25.949 --> 20:27.717
to pull a pistol out
your boot or something.

20:27.718 --> 20:28.951
Then let me try it.

20:28.952 --> 20:30.520
Okay, let's go, boy. You go. You do it.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.954
Here we go. Let me... Mind
if I...? Let me tie my shoes.

20:31.955 --> 20:34.457
Aah! Don't you put your foot on my table!

20:34.458 --> 20:36.125
- What are you...?
- Oh.

20:36.126 --> 20:40.062
Okay, over, under, through.

20:40.063 --> 20:42.265
This how Bobby

20:42.266 --> 20:45.767
tie his shoe.

20:47.270 --> 20:49.272
Aw, come on!

20:49.273 --> 20:51.240
Come on, that's just as aggressive.

20:51.241 --> 20:53.276
What is that? You're like Huckleberry.

20:53.277 --> 20:56.379
Your dad's right... you guys
got some aggressive strolls.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.614
Anybody want anything from the kitchen?

20:58.615 --> 21:00.115
Whoa, whoa!

21:04.887 --> 21:07.657
I'm surprised Nekeisha
hasn't gotten shot yet.

21:07.658 --> 21:15.278
