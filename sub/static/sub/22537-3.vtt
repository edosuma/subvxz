<i>The Lost Room</i>

00:01.658 --> 00:02.241
What's this?

00:02.446 --> 00:05.549
<i>Joe Miller has found a key
to a room not like any other.</i>

00:05.550 --> 00:06.437
We can go anywhere?

00:06.506 --> 00:08.214
<i>A room of great power.</i>

00:08.285 --> 00:10.787
All the objects come from
the motel room...

00:10.814 --> 00:13.096
- And do they all...
- They do weird stuff.

00:13.295 --> 00:15.030
A room of great danger.

00:15.654 --> 00:17.363
- Anna!
- Daddy!

00:17.636 --> 00:19.371
My daughter disappeared
inside that room.

00:19.372 --> 00:21.313
Is there an object that
can bring her back?

00:21.367 --> 00:22.775
Prime object is what you need.

00:22.843 --> 00:24.853
If it exists,
it's inside the vault.

00:24.854 --> 00:26.669
Do you think you can
trust a man like that?

00:26.670 --> 00:27.613
His kid is dying.

00:27.668 --> 00:30.360
I have my own object I need
from the vault : the Glass Eye.

00:30.415 --> 00:31.822
It can repair all flesh.

00:32.137 --> 00:33.517
People are coming for you Joe.

00:33.894 --> 00:36.750
They won't mind killing you
to get their hands on these objects.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.856
- Do you give yourself to the Order?
- Yes.

00:40.553 --> 00:41.537
Give me the key, Joe.

00:43.122 --> 00:46.444
Detective Joe Miller
just shot his partner.

00:46.683 --> 00:47.995
Who fired the first shot?

00:48.432 --> 00:50.209
<i>Now, to get his daughter back,</i>

00:50.237 --> 00:51.781
<i>he has one last hope.</i>

00:51.782 --> 00:52.896
The man in the room.

00:53.211 --> 00:55.370
If I'm right, he's the Prime object.

00:55.698 --> 00:56.832
And we're gonna find him.

Anna!

02:38.419 --> 02:39.472
Anna!

02:44.651 --> 02:46.113
Somebody help me!

02:46.974 --> 02:49.558
- Lee, help me! Anna!
- Daddy!

02:51.417 --> 02:52.715
Lee, help me!

03:13.990 --> 03:16.477
Ruber, what the hell
did you do to me?

03:32.237 --> 03:33.412
How you feeling, kiddo?

03:36.406 --> 03:37.704
We're getting close, son.

03:42.734 --> 03:43.745
Car's ready, sir.

04:03.126 --> 04:03.564
Hey.

04:05.505 --> 04:06.215
Did you sleep?

04:07.623 --> 04:08.347
No.

04:10.015 --> 04:11.655
I just can't come up with anything.

04:15.017 --> 04:17.367
You sure these pictures
don't mean anything to you?

04:18.036 --> 04:18.707
No.

04:19.349 --> 04:22.342
I mean, except that the collectors
keep showing up again and again.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.256
The pictures, the film.

04:25.234 --> 04:26.492
But I can't make a connection.

04:27.462 --> 04:28.296
I can't either.

04:29.704 --> 04:32.792
I just hope they can help us
find out who the man in this room was.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.371
We're in uncharted
territory here, Joe.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.674
I mean, no one's
ever seen this guy before.

04:39.675 --> 04:41.321
We don't know that
he actually existed.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.806
Jennifer, he was standing
right there. We both saw him.

04:45.624 --> 04:47.456
And if the prime object is a person,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.569
it makes sense that he'd be
able to bring my daughter back.

04:53.944 --> 04:56.236
Gotta find him. That's all
I care about right now.

04:57.610 --> 04:58.184
Right.

05:08.216 --> 05:09.193
What are you gonna do?

05:11.290 --> 05:13.149
I'm gonna take another
look at the film.

05:13.737 --> 05:14.817
The collectors...

05:15.609 --> 05:17.455
disturbed reality somehow.

05:19.369 --> 05:20.749
I want to try and figure it out.

05:29.565 --> 05:30.194
What?

05:30.945 --> 05:33.173
Kreutzfeld sent you after
those polaroids, didn't he?

05:33.174 --> 05:34.376
He didn't send me.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.861
We're working together.

05:42.705 --> 05:45.282
What makes you think
you can trust him so much?

06:29.248 --> 06:30.150
Good morning, Sir.

06:30.847 --> 06:31.544
Right this way.

06:32.323 --> 06:32.733
Please.

06:33.238 --> 06:34.277
Welcome to the Sood's.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.140
Mr. Kreutzfeld,

06:46.427 --> 06:47.520
my good friend.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.486
At last we meet in person.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.744
You're early.

06:51.908 --> 06:54.463
Never early for business,
is it, Sood?

06:54.846 --> 06:56.158
No, no, never, never.

06:56.739 --> 06:58.188
You go everywhere together?

06:59.213 --> 07:00.744
Oh, yeah. Afraid so.

07:01.495 --> 07:03.942
Not by choice.
I prefer my old life.

07:04.817 --> 07:05.992
I was once normal.

07:06.088 --> 07:07.167
It's overrated.

07:07.523 --> 07:08.808
Sit, please.

07:20.296 --> 07:21.225
First edition.

07:21.321 --> 07:22.523
Rough around the edges.

07:22.824 --> 07:23.685
I'd call it...

07:24.122 --> 07:24.997
"Fair condition".

07:30.438 --> 07:31.805
A little less fair now.

07:32.789 --> 07:35.126
- Just checking it's not an object.
- No, no, no.

07:35.194 --> 07:36.452
Never objects in my shop,

07:36.670 --> 07:37.791
only science.

07:37.955 --> 07:40.101
Pictures of objects.
Videos,

07:40.183 --> 07:41.263
artifacts.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.903
No objects for sale.

07:43.122 --> 07:43.915
That's...

07:44.051 --> 07:45.500
dangerous business.

07:47.837 --> 07:48.739
Tell me more.

07:54.014 --> 07:55.654
It belonged to John Clark,

07:56.187 --> 07:57.158
one of the collectors.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.648
Born 1938,

07:58.730 --> 08:00.370
- died...
- 1971.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.694
In the first cabal war.

08:02.912 --> 08:05.618
- How do you know it's Clark's?
- I just bought itoff his nephew.

08:06.138 --> 08:08.242
Had a bunch of stuff in a trunk.

08:08.365 --> 08:09.705
No idea what it was.

08:09.828 --> 08:13.068
I called you first, of course.
I know you have a taste for...

08:13.322 --> 08:15.057
collectors' artifacts.

08:15.673 --> 08:17.723
Thank you for coming
to me with this.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.798
I'll of course pay
whatever it is you're asking.

08:21.826 --> 08:23.644
Whatever price you think is fair.

08:23.945 --> 08:26.295
And I shall accept your word
that it's genuine.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.769
But if at some point
I should find out that it's fake,

08:29.770 --> 08:31.388
that you tried
to con me in any way,

08:31.389 --> 08:35.092
or that I hear you've made copies
and someone else has one,

08:36.609 --> 08:39.274
then I'll have to come back here
and hurt you.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.905
Mr. Kreutzfeld,

08:42.192 --> 08:42.916
my friend.

08:43.217 --> 08:44.174
I am the Sood.

08:44.347 --> 08:45.666
I deal in science.

08:45.776 --> 08:46.719
No fakes,

08:46.951 --> 08:49.357
no forgeries, no duplicates.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.213
I stake my life on it.

09:04.337 --> 09:04.815
No, no, no!

09:04.979 --> 09:06.619
I don't have anything
to do with that.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.202
Mick, what's going on out there?

09:12.936 --> 09:14.207
- Is that a way out?
- Yes.

09:14.425 --> 09:15.068
This way.

09:27.725 --> 09:30.089
You need to tread
very carefully now.

09:32.084 --> 09:33.642
You need to tell me
what's going on.

09:33.643 --> 09:34.954
I've told you everything I know.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.991
I've been straight with you
from the beginning.

09:38.836 --> 09:39.697
Then what's this?

09:41.227 --> 09:42.170
That's the...

09:42.198 --> 09:44.097
combination to the collectors' vault,

09:44.630 --> 09:45.587
wherever it is.

09:45.949 --> 09:47.890
It's what we both
have been looking for.

09:48.628 --> 09:50.815
In the vault, I believe,
is the Glass Eye,

09:51.116 --> 09:54.642
which has the power
to destroy or repair all flesh.

09:55.913 --> 09:58.592
Could be used as a
weapon most definitely,

09:58.593 --> 10:01.096
but it could also cure
my son's leukemia.

10:01.097 --> 10:03.624
Can I be any more clear, detective?

10:07.805 --> 10:08.940
What about the man?

10:11.919 --> 10:12.821
What man?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.555
The man in the motel room.
Who was he?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.259
You're speaking of the occupant theory.

10:24.268 --> 10:27.849
People far more obsessed than you
have gone down that road.

10:28.015 --> 10:31.937
"Who did the objects belong to?
There has to be an occupant." Right?

10:33.331 --> 10:34.261
I say no.

10:34.582 --> 10:35.511
There's no occupant.

10:36.051 --> 10:36.830
I've seen him.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.902
I took the polaroid
to the original motel.

10:43.286 --> 10:47.072
I went inside the motel room, and I saw
it just like it was back in 1961.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.750
And there was a man in the room.

10:56.284 --> 10:57.158
My God.

10:57.773 --> 10:59.126
You really didn't know, did you?

11:04.211 --> 11:05.714
That certainly explains

11:06.439 --> 11:08.243
something I've never
really understood.

11:09.254 --> 11:10.389
Most of the time,

11:10.596 --> 11:11.963
in the evidence I found,

11:14.210 --> 11:16.609
the collectors referred to
their hiding place as a vault.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.234
But in two instances,
they call it a tomb.

11:22.569 --> 11:23.512
You think he's dead?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.307
Nobody's seen him.
Nobody knows who he is.

11:26.308 --> 11:27.968
Trust me. I've done the research.

11:30.045 --> 11:31.193
But if there's a body,

11:31.589 --> 11:33.503
and the collectors hid it somewhere,

11:33.790 --> 11:35.020
it might be in the vault.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.033
I got this from Conroy's husband.

11:41.252 --> 11:42.526
He's the last living collector.

11:43.734 --> 11:44.951
I had it digitized.

11:45.730 --> 11:46.837
Unbelievable.

11:48.606 --> 11:51.162
The collectors are trying
to do an experiment in room 9.

11:52.937 --> 11:53.388
Look.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.493
They nailed objects to the door.

11:57.037 --> 11:58.294
This is huge.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.700
It gets weirder.

12:04.649 --> 12:06.385
Wh-what's happening now?

12:10.185 --> 12:12.194
I think this is where
the world almost ends.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.852
The original film was stolen.

12:18.453 --> 12:20.230
Someone's a step
ahead of us on this.

12:20.394 --> 12:23.093
I'll kick this up the ladder.
Get the legion moving on it.

12:24.836 --> 12:27.078
Your lt back in Pittsburgh
has been calling.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.948
Wants to know how the hell
we let Joe Miller escape.

12:31.452 --> 12:32.162
I don't know.

12:32.326 --> 12:34.376
There's no hallucinogens
in your system.

12:34.431 --> 12:35.251
You're clean.

12:35.512 --> 12:36.018
No,

12:36.086 --> 12:39.612
- Martin Ruber did something to me.
- I think you should go back home

12:40.147 --> 12:42.552
as soon as the doctors
release you, detective.

12:43.837 --> 12:45.682
Not until I find Martin Ruber.

13:40.347 --> 13:41.700
You're probably gonna die...

13:42.164 --> 13:43.313
of dehydration.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.980
I just thought I'd mention.

14:08.229 --> 14:08.899
No!

14:13.299 --> 14:13.941
No!

14:51.445 --> 14:52.484
I've been promoted.

14:52.907 --> 14:54.178
By the Pontifex himself.

14:55.039 --> 14:57.718
So your cell will
report directly to me

14:57.854 --> 14:58.783
from now on.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.610
Congratulations, Parchman.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.415
Thanks.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.750
Should've been you.

15:11.734 --> 15:15.738
But you let Ruber steal two objects
right out from under you.

15:16.462 --> 15:18.922
You know what
the punishment is for that.

15:21.423 --> 15:22.995
I'll get the objects back.

15:25.339 --> 15:26.706
And I'll take care of Ruber.

15:28.629 --> 15:29.121
Good.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.374
It would be a shame to lose you.

15:50.052 --> 15:51.200
Key, clock,

15:51.692 --> 15:52.349
scissors.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.809
If we want into the vault,
we need all three.

15:55.088 --> 15:55.970
Between us,

15:56.106 --> 15:58.157
of course,
we have the key and the clock.

15:59.797 --> 16:00.877
It's the scissors. I...

16:02.366 --> 16:04.451
I think I know someone
who can help us find them.

16:08.149 --> 16:10.185
Where did you vanish, Mr. Kreutzfeld?

16:10.841 --> 16:13.069
The Sood has
security video and everything.

16:13.643 --> 16:14.217
Yeah.

16:14.609 --> 16:16.591
I had a little lapse in security.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.723
He's trying to sell the DVD now.

16:24.452 --> 16:25.969
So what are you guys looking for?

16:26.133 --> 16:26.898
Scissors.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.371
You're pitching slow balls.

16:31.773 --> 16:32.278
Ten grand.

16:32.798 --> 16:33.440
Cash.

16:36.037 --> 16:36.543
Five.

16:41.563 --> 16:43.203
- Okay, ten.
- Twelve.

16:48.726 --> 16:51.090
I think you've tried
my patience enough for one day.

16:59.729 --> 17:00.836
Zoraida Figueroa.

17:01.136 --> 17:02.243
Washington, D.C.

17:02.536 --> 17:04.012
She deals crystal methor

17:04.441 --> 17:05.425
pop tarts or something.

17:05.698 --> 17:06.559
Is she dangerous?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.944
The scissors are
rarely sought after.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.961
But she's had 'em for three years.
So she must be doing something right.

17:11.962 --> 17:13.608
And what do the scissors do, exactly?

17:14.981 --> 17:16.444
They rotate things.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.505
So what do you do,
spin plates with them?

17:19.587 --> 17:22.478
Dude, if you want to theorize,
I'm gonna charge you another grand.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.028
So Zoraida's apartment
is up on the fourth floor.

17:32.029 --> 17:35.240
And if she still has the scissors,
we should be able to just buy 'em off her.

17:35.745 --> 17:37.440
This is a terrific neighborhood.

17:38.455 --> 17:41.303
Is there a reason we couldn't
just come here through the motel room?

17:41.304 --> 17:43.833
It's just it's not that easy.
I've never been here before.

17:44.516 --> 17:46.942
Besides, I like to see
what I'm getting into first.

18:05.749 --> 18:07.211
Maybe we should surprise her.

18:07.915 --> 18:10.649
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't want her
to rotate us till we're dizzy.

18:17.331 --> 18:18.302
That's her apartment?

18:37.969 --> 18:39.048
Stay behind me.

18:39.609 --> 18:40.620
If you insist.

19:36.368 --> 19:37.544
Zoraida, I'm...

19:45.197 --> 19:46.858
You want something from me, huh?

19:55.393 --> 19:56.349
You want some too?

20:04.900 --> 20:06.557
Oh, rotates.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.078
Calm down.

20:34.196 --> 20:36.089
You picked the wrong
girl to mess with.

21:09.459 --> 21:11.263
Having a hard time breathing?

21:11.837 --> 21:12.998
I'll take this.

21:52.567 --> 21:53.305
Please.

21:55.328 --> 21:56.722
Don't take my scissors.

22:00.808 --> 22:01.519
I'm sorry.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.607
It's all I have left.

22:33.904 --> 22:34.573
Get up!

22:35.749 --> 22:36.282
Get...

22:36.979 --> 22:37.457
up!

23:00.890 --> 23:02.557
Who the hell is that?

23:09.501 --> 23:10.048
That,

23:10.977 --> 23:14.229
I believe, is the combination
to the vault.

23:16.799 --> 23:18.699
If only we knew where the vault was.

23:25.834 --> 23:26.709
What is this?

23:27.966 --> 23:29.360
I don't know. The sun?

23:29.838 --> 23:31.301
No, I've seen this before.

23:42.222 --> 23:43.219
I'll be right back.

24:20.974 --> 24:22.355
Barbara Stritzke had these.

24:23.147 --> 24:25.129
The location of the
collector's vault is hidden

24:25.130 --> 24:27.220
somehow inside those pictures.
I'm sure of it.

24:31.374 --> 24:33.384
They certainly make no sense to me.

24:33.425 --> 24:37.149
Well, it didn't make sense to me at first
either, but together they make up a map.

24:38.154 --> 24:38.967
A map.

24:39.534 --> 24:42.801
Well, a map or instructions.
It makes sense if you've used the key.

24:42.910 --> 24:44.181
When you leave the room,

24:44.372 --> 24:46.716
you have to picture a door in your mind.
If you don't,

24:47.011 --> 24:48.951
it'll just pick a door
for you at random.

24:48.958 --> 24:51.377
If you want a specific door,
you have to have been there.

24:51.378 --> 24:53.695
You have to be able to fix
an image of it in your mind.

24:53.696 --> 24:55.759
And I think that's what
these pictures are for.

24:56.671 --> 24:57.860
To take you to the vault

24:58.585 --> 25:00.320
without ever
having been there before.

25:01.646 --> 25:02.056
And...

25:02.398 --> 25:03.518
where is "there" exactly?

25:09.779 --> 25:10.517
Okay.

25:11.548 --> 25:13.038
What do these look like to you?

25:14.275 --> 25:17.367
They look like lines.
Maybe out of focus.

25:22.585 --> 25:23.596
These are bars.

25:24.717 --> 25:26.549
And that's a guard tower.
You see that?

25:27.328 --> 25:29.105
I can't believe
I didn't see this before.

25:32.275 --> 25:33.150
This is a prison.

25:33.943 --> 25:34.927
We find the prison,

25:35.091 --> 25:35.938
we find the vault.

26:17.475 --> 26:17.994
Hey.

26:18.869 --> 26:19.361
Hi.

26:25.566 --> 26:26.276
What's wrong?

26:29.680 --> 26:30.664
Why do you want this?

26:31.306 --> 26:33.533
Why do you need the Legion's
files on the collectors?

26:33.534 --> 26:35.994
I'm trying to find a way
into the vault, with Kreutzfeld.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.527
Oh, God.

26:39.099 --> 26:42.065
I'm sorry you don't like this,
but this is the best chance I've got.

26:42.229 --> 26:43.227
You forget, Joe.

26:43.650 --> 26:44.976
I used to know Kreutzfeld.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.518
I liked him too.

26:48.188 --> 26:50.497
But something happened to him.
He changed.

26:51.441 --> 26:52.261
I trust him.

26:54.503 --> 26:56.950
He's gonna kill you
as soon as he's done with you.

27:01.131 --> 27:02.969
You're putting
the rest of us in danger.

27:03.332 --> 27:05.054
I'm just trying to find my little girl.

27:05.095 --> 27:07.364
I can't worry about
the whole damn world. I'm not you.

27:17.697 --> 27:19.433
You don't think
I wake up every morning...

27:20.390 --> 27:21.975
wanting my old life back?

27:28.303 --> 27:29.834
You don't get to choose, Joe.

27:35.041 --> 27:35.847
No, I don't.

27:56.915 --> 27:58.815
I'm not ready
to come back to Pittsburgh yet.

27:59.218 --> 28:00.339
I need some time off.

28:01.405 --> 28:02.662
I'm searching for something.

28:18.367 --> 28:19.857
What? What's the matter?

28:20.404 --> 28:22.823
Wally, you can't send
teenage girls to Hell.

28:22.864 --> 28:25.338
You kidding me? Teenage girls
deserve it the most. Look,

28:26.967 --> 28:29.399
I could've bowled a 260
if those girls weren't teasing me.

28:29.523 --> 28:30.869
I can't bowl
when people watch.

28:30.903 --> 28:31.767
It makes me tense.

28:31.999 --> 28:32.587
Seriously,

28:32.765 --> 28:34.363
I could go pro
if no one was watching.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.797
That's great, Wally.
Listen to me.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.067
I think I found a way
into the collector's vault.

28:38.068 --> 28:39.604
What, you don't think I can go pro?

28:39.610 --> 28:41.673
- Wally... Wally!
- You should see my release.

28:43.081 --> 28:45.605
What do you think you're
gonna find in the vault, Joe?

28:46.722 --> 28:47.979
The occupant and the eye.

28:50.057 --> 28:50.494
Okay.

28:51.055 --> 28:53.433
There's no such thing as the occupant.

28:53.706 --> 28:56.317
And even if there was,
he's long dead by now.

28:56.385 --> 28:57.219
I've seen him.

28:59.765 --> 29:01.501
- And I'm gonna find him.
- Are you nuts?

29:01.502 --> 29:02.799
Do not go in the vault, Joe.

29:03.229 --> 29:03.844
Do you hear me?

29:03.954 --> 29:06.209
The collectors buried
the objects there for a reason.

29:06.210 --> 29:07.589
Wally, I have to find him.

29:08.478 --> 29:11.293
If the occupant's body is in the vault,
I'm taking my chances.

29:11.908 --> 29:13.275
What if he ain't dead, hmm?

29:14.492 --> 29:16.556
What if he's just
sitting there waiting for you?

29:22.229 --> 29:23.650
Why are you really here, Joe?

29:25.522 --> 29:26.670
I need a favor.

29:29.896 --> 29:31.003
This is ridiculous.

29:31.454 --> 29:34.912
I mean, how do you hide objects
for 40 years inside of a prison?

29:35.162 --> 29:36.529
If we're lucky, it's abandoned.

29:36.693 --> 29:37.923
How about if it's torn down?

29:37.924 --> 29:39.713
How about if it's a golf course now?

29:40.014 --> 29:42.105
This is definitelythe door
they want us to use.

29:42.106 --> 29:43.923
There's probably
no other way in or out.

29:48.564 --> 29:49.139
Karl...

29:49.521 --> 29:51.790
What was the name of the collector
who owned that book,

29:51.968 --> 29:53.539
the book you got from the Sood?

29:53.676 --> 29:56.164
John Clark.
He was one of the original...

29:56.314 --> 29:57.366
collectors.

29:58.186 --> 29:59.143
John Clark.

29:59.786 --> 30:01.733
There's something there
in the Legion files?

30:01.849 --> 30:03.448
Here he is. John Clark.

30:04.091 --> 30:06.728
John Clark was a guard
at the state prison in Kellogg county

30:06.769 --> 30:09.120
from 1955 to 1963.

30:09.531 --> 30:11.007
I think we found our prison.

30:20.917 --> 30:22.106
Oh, Karl, you shouldn't have.

30:22.475 --> 30:23.555
It's what I do.

30:24.894 --> 30:26.521
I thought I'd make it easier for us.

30:34.629 --> 30:36.201
You're gonna have to leave the flask.

30:36.884 --> 30:37.664
Excuse me?

30:38.251 --> 30:41.429
We're taking the clock, the scissors,
and the key. No other objects.

30:46.028 --> 30:46.697
Okay.

30:49.239 --> 30:51.640
You should leave the gun, then.
Fair is fair.

30:51.804 --> 30:54.046
Well, technically
the gun's not an object.

30:54.415 --> 30:54.879
Joe.

30:56.734 --> 30:57.445
All right.

30:58.743 --> 31:00.725
And in the interest
of complete disclosure,

31:00.726 --> 31:02.924
I shall leave behind
the cuff link as well.

31:04.829 --> 31:05.956
What the hell does that do?

31:05.957 --> 31:07.750
Lowers blood pressure.

31:08.423 --> 31:10.943
Might be a placebo,
but something's working.

31:12.056 --> 31:12.747
All right.

31:17.077 --> 31:17.480
You ready?

31:17.786 --> 31:18.284
Yes.

31:30.653 --> 31:31.756
Do you have it yet?

31:32.324 --> 31:33.995
Just give me one more second.

31:36.968 --> 31:37.913
I think I got it.

31:43.606 --> 31:44.708
What are you waiting for?

31:45.067 --> 31:46.090
Wait!

31:48.422 --> 31:49.498
Karl, hang on!

31:50.617 --> 31:51.422
Hang on!

31:52.148 --> 31:53.338
- You got me?
- I got you.

31:53.595 --> 31:54.514
Maybe I'm wrong,

31:54.592 --> 31:56.963
but I thought
we wanted the inside of the prison.

32:00.911 --> 32:02.359
All right, ready.
Come on up.

32:12.316 --> 32:13.401
I guess I owe you one.

32:14.398 --> 32:15.352
Forget it, we're even.

32:28.844 --> 32:30.279
Well, at least it's abandoned.

32:30.388 --> 32:32.735
Yeah, but it's still the wrong door.
I can't get it.

32:35.432 --> 32:37.345
If I was a vault, where would I be?

32:39.081 --> 32:40.488
Well, it's doubtful it's in here.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.223
I just can't get a lock on this door.

32:45.709 --> 32:47.158
These pictures just don't add up.

32:58.092 --> 32:59.021
Wait a minute.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.349
If it's in a fall out shelter,
it's underneath the prison.

33:05.539 --> 33:06.032
Come on.

33:28.911 --> 33:29.854
So is this it?

33:31.658 --> 33:32.724
Looks like it.

33:37.467 --> 33:38.643
It's not a real door.

33:39.176 --> 33:39.886
What?

33:41.130 --> 33:42.538
It's just painted on.

33:47.621 --> 33:49.070
What does this look like to you?

33:54.168 --> 33:55.589
It's Conroy, isn't it?

33:56.081 --> 33:56.656
No.

33:58.173 --> 33:59.936
There's someone else in that room.

34:05.061 --> 34:05.854
It's him.

34:10.473 --> 34:11.553
It's the occupant.

34:13.070 --> 34:14.683
The man I saw in the polaroid.

34:20.681 --> 34:21.420
Damn it!

34:31.917 --> 34:33.379
Why don't you use the key?

34:35.443 --> 34:36.467
No lock.

34:47.777 --> 34:48.625
Concrete.

34:50.567 --> 34:51.496
Collectors.

34:51.879 --> 34:54.762
What does the clock do exactly?
It doesn't happen to...

34:54.831 --> 34:56.143
drill through walls, does it?

34:57.236 --> 34:58.985
It sublimates brass.

35:00.529 --> 35:01.445
Sublimates?

35:01.469 --> 35:04.880
Turns solids into gas
without liquifying.

35:05.307 --> 35:06.259
Or vice versa.

35:06.476 --> 35:07.891
Sort of like when...

35:08.739 --> 35:10.798
dry ice becomes steam.

35:11.814 --> 35:13.971
- And the scissors...
- Rotate.

35:14.664 --> 35:15.757
Yeah, I got that one.

35:22.623 --> 35:24.177
There's a seam here.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.438
Hand me the scissors.

35:31.766 --> 35:32.464
Right.

35:33.927 --> 35:35.473
Be careful with these, will you?

36:07.313 --> 36:07.812
Thank you.

36:08.197 --> 36:08.766
Yeah,

36:09.449 --> 36:10.429
nice work.

36:27.990 --> 36:29.384
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.165
What the hell?

36:32.102 --> 36:34.186
Good thing you had me
leave my gun behind.

36:34.973 --> 36:36.829
Starting to have
second thoughts about that.

36:40.304 --> 36:41.346
What do we got here?

36:42.904 --> 36:44.094
Our fallout shelter.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.701
Welded shut.

36:49.548 --> 36:50.511
Let me guess.

36:51.798 --> 36:52.866
With brass.

37:09.524 --> 37:10.811
We should step back a little.

37:11.327 --> 37:12.010
Why's that?

37:12.657 --> 37:14.732
I don't want to breathe in
metallic gas, do you?

37:26.363 --> 37:27.580
I found what you wanted.

37:29.028 --> 37:32.377
Here's the Legion's report of all
the objects and their known where abouts.

37:33.402 --> 37:35.479
I don't know
how accurate that is, but...

37:36.081 --> 37:37.618
that's the closest thing we've got.

37:38.008 --> 37:39.156
Great, thanks.

38:02.487 --> 38:03.389
Oh, my God.

38:03.813 --> 38:04.551
Look at this.

38:11.891 --> 38:12.575
I don't get it.

38:12.930 --> 38:14.201
These are the Conroy objects.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.222
The same objects from the film.

38:18.069 --> 38:19.491
Karl Kreutzfeld has them all.

38:20.052 --> 38:21.104
He's trying to recreate

38:21.419 --> 38:22.580
the Conroy experiment.

38:22.977 --> 38:24.552
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

38:24.576 --> 38:26.353
It's suicide. He'll kill us all.

38:27.036 --> 38:28.403
Not if we kill him first.

38:31.001 --> 38:32.832
I hope the prime object's in there.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.167
I hope we both get
what we want out of this.

38:37.698 --> 38:39.898
After I get my daughter back,
you can have the key.

38:41.443 --> 38:42.263
I don't want it.

38:44.039 --> 38:45.706
I couldn't have done this without you.

39:46.397 --> 39:47.381
Oh, my God.

39:53.218 --> 39:54.126
We found it.

40:05.125 --> 40:07.695
Joe, nobody's seen these
objects in over 40 years.

40:56.789 --> 40:57.839
Oh, no.

40:59.260 --> 40:59.850
No.

41:04.388 --> 41:05.142
I'm sorry.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.012
I'm so sorry, Joe.

41:32.511 --> 41:34.042
Joe, my search is over.

41:36.677 --> 41:38.853
Well, that's great for you, Karl,
but mine's not.

41:39.082 --> 41:39.979
Oh, but it is.

41:41.238 --> 41:42.947
I can bring your daughter back now.

41:44.191 --> 41:44.683
How?

41:45.544 --> 41:47.266
How can you bring Anna back?

41:48.482 --> 41:50.204
The same way
I bring Isaac back.

41:53.156 --> 41:55.048
Do you know what
the quarter does, Joe?

42:05.334 --> 42:07.767
It brings life to memories
for a short time.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.474
Two days, sometimes three.

42:18.962 --> 42:19.851
Oh, my God.

42:19.946 --> 42:21.054
My son Isaac.

42:25.318 --> 42:26.849
He died nine years ago.

42:28.721 --> 42:30.033
This is all I have left.

42:35.938 --> 42:37.304
It was enough for a while.

42:38.316 --> 42:39.272
Karl, what are you...

42:41.090 --> 42:41.951
What are you saying?

42:42.853 --> 42:45.942
You're still not seeing
the objects for what they really are.

42:47.568 --> 42:48.662
They're tools.

42:50.145 --> 42:52.100
Tools to reshape reality.

42:53.521 --> 42:56.227
The properties
that we perceive, they're...

42:57.635 --> 42:59.494
side effects, tips of the iceberg.

42:59.904 --> 43:01.749
The objects allow us to change

43:01.750 --> 43:04.866
reality on levels that
our brains can't even understand.

43:05.193 --> 43:09.239
Don't you see? Conroy opened up
a door through reality itself...

43:10.810 --> 43:12.491
Where anything is possible.

43:13.339 --> 43:14.337
Listen to me.

43:15.826 --> 43:17.999
I saw what Conroy did.

43:19.858 --> 43:22.154
And she almost
ripped reality apart.

43:22.208 --> 43:24.627
But I can do it right this time.
I can bring my boy back.

43:24.628 --> 43:26.129
I can bring him back to life.

43:26.443 --> 43:29.081
We can both bring our children back,
both of them!

43:29.082 --> 43:31.568
No, Karl, this isn't
just about us.

43:32.272 --> 43:34.226
- What if you're wrong?
- It will work!

43:34.227 --> 43:35.661
And what if it doesn't?!

43:41.622 --> 43:43.931
Well, everyone will be dead.
It won't really matter.

43:45.846 --> 43:46.898
Well, I can't do that.

43:47.144 --> 43:47.909
Yes.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.969
You said you were willing
to do whatever it took.

43:52.393 --> 43:53.022
I am.

43:54.074 --> 43:55.127
But not this.

44:02.616 --> 44:04.243
Then I'm gonna need the key, Joe.

44:05.076 --> 44:05.623
No.

44:08.889 --> 44:11.936
The quarter brings
living memories as well.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.202
No.

44:15.681 --> 44:16.323
The key.

45:24.165 --> 45:25.327
Sorry, Joe!

45:28.306 --> 45:30.343
Kreutzfeld, you son of a bitch!

46:18.476 --> 46:18.968
Hey.

46:24.079 --> 46:25.227
You're getting good at that.

46:25.938 --> 46:26.662
You okay?

46:27.278 --> 46:27.660
No.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.706
Thanks for the loan, wally.

46:30.707 --> 46:31.473
My pleasure.

46:32.059 --> 46:33.932
Uh, your lady friend is here.

46:44.905 --> 46:46.736
You were right about Kreutzfeld.

46:48.294 --> 46:50.454
I lost the key.
I lost everything.

46:57.520 --> 46:59.228
I know what Kreutzfeld's
trying to do.

46:59.283 --> 47:01.292
He's trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

47:02.303 --> 47:03.424
His son is dead.

47:03.779 --> 47:05.037
He wants to resurrect him.

47:05.966 --> 47:07.442
And now he has
the Glass Eye.

47:10.586 --> 47:11.884
I'm responsible for that.

47:14.372 --> 47:17.270
Listen, Joe, I restored the film,
and I saw exactly what happened.

47:17.379 --> 47:18.978
Conroy didn't stop
the experiment.

47:20.085 --> 47:21.261
The occupant did.

47:21.985 --> 47:22.873
The occupant?

47:29.714 --> 47:33.213
I am sorry. I don't know how to do this,
but we have to stop Kreutzfeld somehow

47:33.214 --> 47:33.609
now!

47:33.971 --> 47:35.611
Let me do that
with the Legion.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.741
But if we fail,
the occupant's our last hope.

47:39.625 --> 47:40.491
You have to find him.

47:40.492 --> 47:43.699
I don't know where to start. I don't have
the key. I don't have anything.

47:45.287 --> 47:47.419
Joe, you've come farther
than anyone else.

47:48.335 --> 47:49.415
You'll find him.

48:24.929 --> 48:25.913
We're ready, son.

48:27.081 --> 48:29.329
All right, think.
What do we know about the occupant?

48:29.330 --> 48:29.849
Nothing.

48:29.918 --> 48:32.268
The objects all belong to him,
so they're his

48:32.351 --> 48:34.715
personal possessions.
So there's gotta be at least

48:35.033 --> 48:37.635
one thing that identifies him or...

48:37.636 --> 48:40.019
I didn't even know there was
an occupant till yesterday.

48:40.020 --> 48:43.354
How would I have any idea if he...
What are you... Don't touch...

48:43.355 --> 48:46.514
Wait a minute, before it was an object,
this was just a bus ticket, right?

48:46.515 --> 48:48.562
I need you not to do that.
Come on!

48:48.563 --> 48:50.873
Do you know how hard it is
for me to get that duct tape

48:50.874 --> 48:53.006
on there without zapping
myself here all the..

48:56.245 --> 48:57.106
Whoa. Look at that.

48:58.883 --> 49:00.059
Bus route's right on there.

49:01.330 --> 49:03.421
Willowbrook, Arizona.
That's where he came from.

49:04.583 --> 49:05.799
That's a start, my friend.

49:07.166 --> 49:07.876
Pull over here.

49:07.877 --> 49:09.748
- Think we're at the driveway?
- Right here.

49:09.749 --> 49:11.419
- Right here?
- Yep, right here.

49:16.203 --> 49:19.005
Welcome to Willowbrook,
home of the occupant, whoever he is.

49:19.264 --> 49:21.848
Well, if I'm right,
he disappeared from here in 1961,

49:22.011 --> 49:23.978
so I'm gonna check
the missing persons reports.

49:23.979 --> 49:25.141
Where's the police station?

49:25.688 --> 49:27.659
Wally, I'm wanted
for murder and kidnapping.

49:27.660 --> 49:29.231
I can't walk into a police station.

49:29.723 --> 49:31.691
We're at the hall of records.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.142
Sheriff, it's detective Bridgewater.

49:38.463 --> 49:39.297
You still in town?

49:39.434 --> 49:40.500
Yeah, I have a question.

49:40.612 --> 49:44.029
Detective Miller and Dr. Ruber
escaped in a prisoner transport van.

49:44.097 --> 49:45.833
- Did it ever turn up?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

49:46.024 --> 49:48.047
<i>- Abandoned not too far from here.</i>
- Where?

49:48.553 --> 49:51.683
<i>Motel sunshine. Just off old Route 66.
You know the place?</i>

49:52.940 --> 49:53.624
Yeah.

50:45.950 --> 50:46.836
Novocaine.

50:48.115 --> 50:48.672
Sir?

50:54.315 --> 50:55.670
I need novocaine

50:55.769 --> 50:56.961
and a syringe.

51:02.788 --> 51:03.160
I'll...

51:03.422 --> 51:04.176
see to it, sir.

51:11.688 --> 51:13.568
What, a man can't sing
to his bus ticket?

51:24.696 --> 51:27.183
Well, there were
no missing persons in 1961,

51:27.184 --> 51:28.537
but there was an extra person.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.218
What's an extra person?

51:31.106 --> 51:34.304
<i>Police arrested an unidentified man
yesterday blah blah blah blah.</i>

51:34.543 --> 51:36.224
<i>The man accosted Mabel Smith,</i>

51:36.388 --> 51:37.782
<i>24 of Willowbrook,</i>

51:37.908 --> 51:39.234
<i>claiming to be her husband.</i>

51:39.384 --> 51:40.956
<i>Miss Smith is unmarried.</i>

51:41.243 --> 51:42.404
Who's Mabel Smith?

51:42.776 --> 51:44.170
She's the town librarian.

51:48.243 --> 51:48.557
Oh,

51:49.145 --> 51:50.320
help you boys?

51:51.140 --> 51:52.015
Mabel Smith?

51:53.560 --> 51:54.680
I'm Joe Miller.

51:55.639 --> 51:57.231
Can we sit down
and talk for a second?

51:57.775 --> 51:58.158
Sure.

52:10.781 --> 52:13.200
I found an old article
that mentions your name.

52:18.408 --> 52:20.143
Why are you showing me this?

52:20.594 --> 52:21.784
I'm looking for him.

52:23.028 --> 52:24.230
I'm sorry. I...

52:24.340 --> 52:25.406
I can't help you.

52:25.665 --> 52:26.335
Mabel,

52:26.786 --> 52:29.916
you filed a police report against
this man. You must remember something.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.426
It's been so long.

52:36.149 --> 52:37.707
He said he was my husband.

52:38.719 --> 52:40.946
I never saw him before, but...

52:41.261 --> 52:43.694
he knew all sorts of things about me.

52:44.472 --> 52:46.932
Things no one knows.

52:47.342 --> 52:49.570
What struck me at the time...

52:51.018 --> 52:53.437
was that he seemed so sure, so...

52:54.326 --> 52:56.622
insistent that I believe him.

52:58.316 --> 52:59.027
And do you...

52:59.601 --> 53:00.489
Did you believe him?

53:00.721 --> 53:02.567
Oh, no, no, no.

53:04.768 --> 53:06.804
But he still haunts me.

53:09.306 --> 53:09.948
You see...

53:11.889 --> 53:13.283
I never married.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.439
And, uh...

53:17.300 --> 53:19.405
He was as close as I came.

53:29.778 --> 53:30.708
What was his name?

53:32.020 --> 53:33.742
Oh, I don't, uh...

53:34.097 --> 53:35.204
I don't remember.

53:35.484 --> 53:38.088
Is there anything else that
you can remember, anything at all?

53:38.089 --> 53:40.221
I can't tell you how
important this is to me.

53:51.389 --> 53:52.660
He gave this to me.

53:53.684 --> 53:55.106
I've never shown anyone.

53:56.950 --> 53:57.893
Now, that's...

53:58.002 --> 53:59.684
him, and that's me.

54:01.146 --> 54:03.046
But that picture was never taken.

54:03.469 --> 54:07.132
I never saw him before
he showed up on my doorstep.

54:08.390 --> 54:09.169
And this...

54:10.973 --> 54:14.280
this is the part that I can't sit with.

54:19.351 --> 54:20.212
Yes,

54:20.335 --> 54:21.647
that's my handwriting.

54:26.171 --> 54:27.484
I still wonder...

54:28.017 --> 54:29.397
if I should've said yes.

54:32.186 --> 54:33.717
"Yes, I remember."

54:37.570 --> 54:39.019
Mabel, may I take this picture?

54:40.359 --> 54:41.315
Yes, take it.

54:42.122 --> 54:42.614
Thank you.

54:50.459 --> 54:52.003
40 years old,

54:52.386 --> 54:53.301
good as new.

54:53.684 --> 54:54.668
It's an object.

54:56.227 --> 54:59.152
Well, Wally, I think I know
why no one's ever found the occupant.

55:00.620 --> 55:02.664
Whatever the event was
that created the objects

55:02.665 --> 55:04.293
ripped him out of the world somehow.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.892
Just like the motel room.

55:07.273 --> 55:08.667
His history's been erased.

55:09.022 --> 55:12.507
No one remembers him. This picture might
be the only evidence he ever even existed.

55:12.593 --> 55:15.886
Yeah, right. A pencil gets plucked out
of existence, nobody cares.

55:16.788 --> 55:17.841
But a whole guy...

55:18.103 --> 55:20.078
And how do you find
a man who doesn't exist?

55:49.357 --> 55:50.492
Oh my God!

55:51.257 --> 55:52.200
It's real.

56:00.386 --> 56:01.110
Bridgewater.

56:01.465 --> 56:01.821
Lee,

56:02.183 --> 56:03.158
sheriff Starns.

56:03.463 --> 56:05.681
Good news.
We just picked up your man Dr. Ruber.

56:06.245 --> 56:07.882
You wanted to know
what he did to you?

56:07.924 --> 56:08.885
Why don't you ask him?

56:08.992 --> 56:09.896
He's at the hospital.

56:14.681 --> 56:16.186
Sood's books.

56:17.035 --> 56:18.636
Welcome to Loserville.

56:18.691 --> 56:23.167
Any disgusting, wanna-be, coulda-been,
has-been object loser hangs out here.

56:24.016 --> 56:25.598
It makes me sick
to see you here.

56:26.678 --> 56:29.012
I need to find something
that IDs the occupant.

56:29.398 --> 56:31.791
Driver's license, some personal item
with his name on it.

56:31.792 --> 56:33.527
The Sood's the guy to ask, but...

56:34.550 --> 56:36.305
He won't help you now.
You pissed him off.

56:37.151 --> 56:39.369
Well, I'll apologize to him.
Smooth things over.

56:39.794 --> 56:40.710
Yeah, that'll work.

56:40.855 --> 56:41.260
Come on.

56:41.854 --> 56:43.166
Uh, I... I'm...

56:43.668 --> 56:46.060
I'm not coming with you.
Anymore.

56:46.639 --> 56:48.028
Those people, my bus ticket...

56:48.279 --> 56:49.591
They're like piranhas.

56:50.420 --> 56:53.854
This whole thing, you're getting in
so deep, it's dangerous for me, man.

56:56.267 --> 56:57.695
I'm sorry, I just can't.

57:10.910 --> 57:11.883
You know what, Wally?

57:12.685 --> 57:13.399
You're right.

57:14.286 --> 57:15.270
Thanks for everything.

57:16.254 --> 57:16.929
I owe you.

57:20.456 --> 57:21.208
Hey, Joe?

57:24.431 --> 57:25.472
Get her back.

57:38.032 --> 57:39.363
Hi. I'm here to see the Sood.

57:39.668 --> 57:40.868
Appointment only.

57:46.094 --> 57:49.085
Look, could you just tell the Sood
that I'd like to apologize?

57:50.647 --> 57:52.480
Appointment only.

57:57.206 --> 57:58.537
Can I make an appointment?

58:00.813 --> 58:01.527
<i>No!</i>

58:18.890 --> 58:19.720
Well, well.

58:21.977 --> 58:24.852
Took me a while, detective.
You're a difficult man to track down.

58:28.748 --> 58:31.150
- But every riddle has an answer...
- I don't have it.

58:33.513 --> 58:35.153
You'll excuse me
if I don't believe you.

58:35.404 --> 58:36.561
Montague, ask yourself,

58:36.562 --> 58:39.243
would I be walking to
my next destination if I had the key?

58:39.802 --> 58:40.285
So what?

58:40.844 --> 58:43.612
You're just another object-loser?
Well, welcome to the club.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.208
That really a gun in your pocket?

58:47.134 --> 58:47.694
Yes.

58:54.684 --> 58:55.648
Intimidating.

58:55.803 --> 58:56.922
You know the Sood?

58:57.072 --> 58:58.054
Do I know the Sood?

58:58.055 --> 59:01.183
Of course I know the Sood. He's a friend,
he's a colleague. We have dinner.

59:01.184 --> 59:01.645
Good.

59:02.625 --> 59:03.840
Introduce me to him.

59:06.271 --> 59:06.946
Sir?

59:09.146 --> 59:09.937
Enter.

59:16.765 --> 59:18.694
Weasel, how many times
have I got to tell you,

59:18.695 --> 59:21.338
keep your stinking
carcass out of my shop.

59:28.118 --> 59:28.890
You too?

59:29.469 --> 59:30.260
Pumeet!

59:30.896 --> 59:31.610
Wait, wait.

59:32.093 --> 59:35.581
Sood, listen. I just wanted
to introduce you to my friend... here...

59:35.716 --> 59:38.668
I know you guys got off
on the wrong foot, so...

59:39.806 --> 59:40.520
Kill them.

59:40.830 --> 59:41.621
Please, Sood.

59:43.242 --> 59:43.840
Hear me out.

59:56.853 --> 01:00:00.325
I want to apologize for the disturbance
I caused here a few days ago.

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:03.277
My argument was with Mr. Kreutzfeld.

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:07.695
And I had no right
bringing that argument here.

01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:09.951
All I want...

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.247
is to find this man.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:17.746
The occupant.

01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:22.839
There's a guy object?

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:24.035
I mean...

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:26.195
There's an object that's a guy?
That... that...

01:00:26.196 --> 01:00:27.392
That changes everything.

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:30.266
You can't find any objects
with this man's name on them.

01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:31.424
No,

01:00:31.984 --> 01:00:34.183
no driver's license.
No business card.

01:00:34.511 --> 01:00:37.231
No such object has ever surfaced.

01:00:41.823 --> 01:00:42.691
Here...

01:00:43.308 --> 01:00:45.392
is where all the known
objects are right now.

01:00:45.393 --> 01:00:47.630
Can you find me the pen?
Where's... where's the pen?

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:48.537
Pen?

01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:51.450
How accurate is this?

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:53.320
It's pretty accurate.

01:00:53.765 --> 01:00:56.350
I've collected as much history
of the objects as I can.

01:00:58.202 --> 01:00:59.070
The key...

01:00:59.553 --> 01:01:00.556
for instance...

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.382
just in the last few weeks,
you've been spotted in Pittsburgh,

01:01:06.383 --> 01:01:07.367
New Mexico,

01:01:07.714 --> 01:01:08.524
Kansas,

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.743
- Cleveland...
- I haven't been to Cleveland.

01:01:16.433 --> 01:01:17.784
How far back does this go?

01:01:18.498 --> 01:01:19.211
Years.

01:01:19.539 --> 01:01:21.546
Back to the beginning for some objects.

01:01:22.298 --> 01:01:24.709
What if you mapped all
their movements all at once?

01:01:26.108 --> 01:01:27.044
What would that prove?

01:01:27.045 --> 01:01:29.653
Well, I'm not sure, but there
might be some sort of a pattern.

01:01:29.654 --> 01:01:30.997
Could you just try it, please? 

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:45.803
What's that?

01:01:47.347 --> 01:01:47.933
What's there?

01:01:48.597 --> 01:01:50.248
No object has ever
been through there.

01:01:50.928 --> 01:01:51.452
Nothing.

01:01:51.823 --> 01:01:52.780
It's the desert.

01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:54.323
That's where he is.

01:01:55.588 --> 01:01:56.684
The occupant in the room.

01:01:57.209 --> 01:01:59.323
Somehow, he is keeping
all the objects away.

01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:02.559
I need to borrow your car.

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:03.690
Great. I'll drive.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:04.987
Give me the keys.

01:02:07.503 --> 01:02:08.568
This is all I have...

01:02:09.571 --> 01:02:10.976
Give me... the keys.

01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:18.322
<i>At the center of the map
is a town called Green Valley.</i>

01:02:18.832 --> 01:02:20.406
<i>Doesn't look like much of a town.</i>

01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:21.700
<i>From the outskirts,</i>

01:02:21.962 --> 01:02:23.151
<i>there's a sanitarium.</i>

01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:24.555
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:02:26.145 --> 01:02:27.843
We have to hit
Kreutzfeld hard and fast.

01:02:28.876 --> 01:02:30.384
It's not gonna be easy getting in.

01:02:30.388 --> 01:02:31.164
Leave that to me.

01:02:31.546 --> 01:02:32.796
I have someone on the inside.

01:02:35.945 --> 01:02:36.423
Look.

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.019
None of us have ever done
anything like this before.

01:02:41.408 --> 01:02:43.168
We have no idea
what we're getting into.

01:02:43.399 --> 01:02:46.378
But if we don't at least try,
we're gonna end up dead anyway, so...

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.971
Let's go. 

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:10.613
What are you doing?

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.030
Hey.

01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:13.140
How are you?

01:03:13.835 --> 01:03:16.131
It's a little project.
It's gonna take a while, though.

01:03:16.132 --> 01:03:19.833
But I remember Anthony said something
about making ice cream, though.

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:21.397
That wouldn't interest you, would it?

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:23.114
Okay.

01:03:25.487 --> 01:03:27.147
Hey, close the door, will you, buddy?

01:03:41.624 --> 01:03:42.550
We're in position.

01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:43.699
Very good.

01:03:43.911 --> 01:03:45.146
Wait for my signal.

01:03:53.076 --> 01:03:53.770
Yeah?

01:03:54.098 --> 01:03:55.082
They're about to attack.

01:03:55.777 --> 01:03:56.703
<i>Wise man.</i>

01:03:56.872 --> 01:03:58.165
<i>You made the right choice.</i>

01:04:54.363 --> 01:04:55.289
No one's here.

01:04:56.736 --> 01:04:58.462
Something's wrong.
I think it's a trap.

01:04:58.627 --> 01:04:59.321
Get out!

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.459
Get out now!

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:12.575
Let's go.

01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:37.556
Don't.

01:05:39.138 --> 01:05:40.507
It won't heal.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.810
Objects don't work in the room.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.918
Hi.

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:16.024
Visiting hours are over.

01:06:17.066 --> 01:06:18.069
Police business.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.693
I'm here to see a patient.

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:23.104
Police, wow.

01:06:23.239 --> 01:06:24.339
Okay, sure.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.882
Uh, who's the patient?

01:06:26.307 --> 01:06:27.329
John Doe.

01:06:31.265 --> 01:06:32.751
You do have a John Doe here?

01:06:35.104 --> 01:06:35.625
Yeah.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.477
He's always been here.

01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:40.602
You should empty your pockets.
He doesn't like things.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:43.304
What do you mean?

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.828
Things, stuff.

01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:45.831
Pens,

01:06:46.062 --> 01:06:46.641
wallets,

01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:48.243
keys.

01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:49.805
Freaks him out.

01:07:15.579 --> 01:07:16.640
The firearm.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:18.685
Stays with me.

01:07:50.885 --> 01:07:52.352
My name is Joe Miller.

01:07:56.133 --> 01:07:57.638
And I just want to ask you a few...

01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:01.979
Easy,

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:03.175
easy.

01:08:03.387 --> 01:08:04.487
Easy. It's okay.

01:08:05.703 --> 01:08:07.458
It's okay. It's okay.

01:08:07.593 --> 01:08:08.577
It's okay.

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:10.603
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:08:11.433 --> 01:08:12.474
Okay?

01:08:14.905 --> 01:08:16.004
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:08:20.518 --> 01:08:21.367
Okay?

01:08:24.627 --> 01:08:27.096
I just want to talk to you,
that's all. All right? 

01:08:32.015 --> 01:08:33.685
I'm just gonna
sit down right here...

01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:34.176
Okay?

01:08:42.415 --> 01:08:44.093
No! Stop!

01:08:56.836 --> 01:08:57.299
Damn.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.509
Oh, my God.

01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:15.917
Who the hell are you?

01:09:18.001 --> 01:09:21.145
I just want to know who you are
and what happened in that motel room.

01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:24.868
- And if you created the ob...
- Stop talking!

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:35.942
I met your wife.

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:37.100
Mabel.

01:09:38.122 --> 01:09:39.231
She gave me your picture.

01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:40.765
She misses you.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.147
Even if she doesn't remember you.

01:09:53.863 --> 01:09:55.465
I felt the photograph coming.

01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:59.632
I thought maybe...

01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:03.337
you might've been...
you might've been my wife.

01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:05.092
So I let you through.

01:10:07.215 --> 01:10:08.045
I'm sorry.

01:10:11.286 --> 01:10:12.289
I'm really sorry.

01:10:14.584 --> 01:10:16.012
Please. It's very important.

01:10:17.556 --> 01:10:20.758
I just need to know,
did you create these objects?

01:10:21.144 --> 01:10:21.723
I didn't.

01:10:23.054 --> 01:10:24.366
Then where did they come from?

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:26.276
I don't know.

01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:29.595
I didn't do anything,
it just happened.

01:10:31.813 --> 01:10:32.893
I need your help.

01:10:35.845 --> 01:10:38.816
My little girl went into that motel room,
and she never came out.

01:10:41.768 --> 01:10:43.215
Can you tell me where she is?

01:10:44.218 --> 01:10:45.221
She's still there.

01:10:45.472 --> 01:10:46.147
Where?

01:10:46.397 --> 01:10:47.864
- In the room.
- No, she's not.

01:10:47.865 --> 01:10:50.680
- I've been there, she's gone.
- There's more than one.

01:10:52.474 --> 01:10:55.793
- What do you mean, there's more than one?
- There's more than one. Come on.

01:10:56.989 --> 01:10:58.224
Can you bring her back?

01:11:00.577 --> 01:11:03.163
Please tell me you can bring her back.

01:11:04.224 --> 01:11:05.189
I can't.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.616
But you can.

01:11:15.723 --> 01:11:16.340
How?

01:11:16.803 --> 01:11:18.018
How can I bring her back?

01:11:19.176 --> 01:11:20.777
Take me to the motel room.

01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:43.611
Almost had me there, Jennifer.

01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:45.270
Yeah, too bad.

01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:50.267
Didn't think you had it in you.

01:11:53.372 --> 01:11:55.707
I want you to witness
what I'm about to do.

01:11:56.826 --> 01:11:59.160
I know you're scared of it,
but if I'm right...

01:12:00.395 --> 01:12:02.691
- If I'm right...
- You're not.

01:12:06.936 --> 01:12:08.942
I won't harm you
unless you interfere.

01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:28.138
I saw him.

01:12:29.739 --> 01:12:30.473
I...

01:12:31.244 --> 01:12:33.058
saw him, he...

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.144
I saw him.

01:12:37.244 --> 01:12:39.289
I've come a long way, Martin.

01:12:41.468 --> 01:12:42.356
Margaret?

01:12:45.096 --> 01:12:46.002
Margaret.

01:12:47.006 --> 01:12:48.260
I saw him.

01:12:48.338 --> 01:12:49.900
Shh, Martin.

01:12:51.039 --> 01:12:53.122
I saw the man in the room.

01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:56.673
What man?

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.876
I saw him through this polaroid.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:03.275
At the motel.

01:13:05.918 --> 01:13:07.076
I saw...

01:13:07.809 --> 01:13:08.735
the occupant.

01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:12.824
The living...

01:13:13.557 --> 01:13:14.271
object.

01:13:18.342 --> 01:13:19.480
This isn't true.

01:13:21.081 --> 01:13:21.988
None of it.

01:13:24.073 --> 01:13:26.272
He gave me a vision.

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:28.028
In the desert.

01:13:30.805 --> 01:13:33.506
He told me that the Order was wrong.

01:13:34.799 --> 01:13:36.015
He said...

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:39.122
that if I could put all the objects

01:13:39.372 --> 01:13:41.224
back together again,

01:13:42.112 --> 01:13:43.539
that I wouldn't just

01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:46.163
talk to God.

01:13:50.331 --> 01:13:51.604
He said...

01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:55.057
I would be God.

01:13:55.983 --> 01:13:57.874
That's why you won't kill me,

01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:00.381
I'm a prophet.

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:16.525
Lee.

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:19.226
I knew you'd come.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:20.576
Ruber.

01:14:23.104 --> 01:14:25.748
Don't smile at me like that.
I want some answers.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.236
Who killed Lou Destefano?

01:14:28.854 --> 01:14:30.011
I did.

01:14:30.397 --> 01:14:31.806
What happened to Anna Miller?

01:14:31.807 --> 01:14:33.041
The motel room took her.

01:14:33.465 --> 01:14:34.893
You know the motel, Lee.

01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:36.594
You dreamed about it.

01:14:37.018 --> 01:14:38.176
How did you know that?

01:14:39.068 --> 01:14:41.151
The motel room is
where the objects come from.

01:14:42.328 --> 01:14:43.023
And they

01:14:43.447 --> 01:14:44.778
protect me.

01:14:45.955 --> 01:14:47.455
I'm the prophet

01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:49.038
of the objects now.

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:51.314
Good-bye, Lee.

01:14:52.896 --> 01:14:54.035
You're under arrest!

01:14:55.095 --> 01:14:57.854
Stop, Ruber,
or I will put a hole in you!

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.196
When you're ready
to know the objects, Lee,

01:15:14.601 --> 01:15:16.338
come find me.

01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:34.147
It's ready.

01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:40.127
I'm nervous, Anthony.

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:41.998
Karl.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.600
Please don't do this.

01:15:45.317 --> 01:15:47.092
I want to see my son.

01:16:19.176 --> 01:16:19.813
No!

01:16:22.398 --> 01:16:23.074
Daddy?

01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:31.273
Isaac.

01:16:33.549 --> 01:16:34.321
Daddy?

01:16:36.907 --> 01:16:37.563
Yeah.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:42.674
Isaac, no.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:45.646
No, Isaac. Please!

01:16:45.839 --> 01:16:46.553
No.

01:16:50.682 --> 01:16:51.512
Please!

01:16:52.438 --> 01:16:53.209
Come back!

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:55.891
Karl, don't!

01:16:58.688 --> 01:16:59.826
<i>I want to see my son.</i>

01:17:26.044 --> 01:17:27.086
Joe, don't!

01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:30.693
Stop!

01:17:56.003 --> 01:17:57.952
I feel like myself again in here.

01:18:05.399 --> 01:18:06.209
Outside...

01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:08.930
in the real world,
there's so much

01:18:09.663 --> 01:18:11.033
noise in my head.

01:18:17.544 --> 01:18:18.547
It's quiet in here.

01:18:20.225 --> 01:18:21.190
Who are you?

01:18:23.215 --> 01:18:24.199
I used to be

01:18:24.488 --> 01:18:26.186
a man named Eddie McCleister.

01:18:28.174 --> 01:18:29.022
Used to be?

01:18:31.223 --> 01:18:32.052
And now you're...

01:18:33.827 --> 01:18:34.965
What, the prime object? 

01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:36.760
No, there's no prime object.

01:18:38.187 --> 01:18:39.942
I'm just an object, like the rest.

01:18:41.235 --> 01:18:42.065
I have a will.

01:18:42.296 --> 01:18:44.370
That's the only thing
that makes me different.

01:18:47.216 --> 01:18:48.566
Except you're alive.

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:52.540
Yeah, unfortunately.

01:18:54.334 --> 01:18:55.530
Unfortunately?

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.071
Outside this room,

01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:05.139
the objects all sense each other.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.666
Always.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:09.344
Like pain.

01:19:09.653 --> 01:19:11.351
Electricity, noise.

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:14.843
For a conscious mind, it's torture.

01:19:24.141 --> 01:19:25.819
You said I could
bring my daughter back.

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:28.964
How do I do that?

01:19:31.029 --> 01:19:31.974
You have to kill me.

01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:36.527
No.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:38.919
I can't.

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:40.347
You can.

01:19:40.752 --> 01:19:41.813
Even if I wanted to,

01:19:42.739 --> 01:19:45.893
you shot yourself in the mouth.
You... you spat the bullet out. I can'T.

01:19:46.405 --> 01:19:48.141
You can kill me in this room.

01:19:49.642 --> 01:19:50.588
Take the burden.

01:19:51.957 --> 01:19:52.902
What burden?

01:19:53.597 --> 01:19:54.484
Become an object.

01:19:54.716 --> 01:19:55.700
Take my place.

01:19:57.321 --> 01:19:59.501
No, I don't understand.
How... how is that possible?

01:19:59.809 --> 01:20:01.652
One object is destroyed,
another is created.

01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:03.022
Conservation of objects.

01:20:06.852 --> 01:20:08.009
Eddie, I can't.

01:20:08.858 --> 01:20:09.919
I... I don't want that.

01:20:10.054 --> 01:20:11.057
I want to die.

01:20:13.179 --> 01:20:14.837
If you want to see
your daughter again,

01:20:14.838 --> 01:20:15.880
you have to kill me.

01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:18.137
Now. Here.
In this motel room.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:19.642
No.

01:20:21.146 --> 01:20:22.574
No, I won't be a murderer.

01:20:22.728 --> 01:20:24.021
Take out your gun.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:25.992
Please.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:27.902
End this.

01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:30.102
No.

01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:32.185
There's a price for everything, Joe.

01:20:32.186 --> 01:20:34.973
This is the price. This is
the price to get your daughter back.

01:20:41.562 --> 01:20:42.314
Please.

01:21:01.898 --> 01:21:03.104
I'll get my daughter back?

01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:09.692
Will my past be erased?

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.505
Like yours was?

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:13.299
I don't know.

01:21:18.045 --> 01:21:19.434
Will my daughter remember me?

01:21:19.973 --> 01:21:20.899
I don't know.

01:21:21.903 --> 01:21:23.253
But she'll be alive.

01:21:25.645 --> 01:21:26.359
I'm sorry.

01:21:46.713 --> 01:21:47.678
God forgive me.

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:01.722
Are you allright?

01:22:02.976 --> 01:22:04.095
What happened?

01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:06.391
Where is he?

01:22:08.359 --> 01:22:08.976
I'm sorry.

01:22:11.118 --> 01:22:11.774
Joe?

01:22:11.967 --> 01:22:12.893
He's gone.

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:15.478
Joe, what did you do?

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:18.430
You have to reset me.

01:22:22.867 --> 01:22:24.160
I'm gonna go in the room.

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:26.543
And I want you
to reset it with the key.

01:22:28.867 --> 01:22:29.600
I can't.

01:22:30.603 --> 01:22:32.426
You're gonna disappear,
just like Anna did.

01:22:32.494 --> 01:22:33.169
I won't.

01:22:34.636 --> 01:22:35.485
I promise.

01:22:54.448 --> 01:22:55.779
You better come back.

01:22:57.168 --> 01:22:57.804
I will.

01:23:10.441 --> 01:23:11.927
Please bring my daughter back.

01:23:18.486 --> 01:23:20.126
Please bring my daughter back.

01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.885
Please.

01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:35.117
- Daddy!
- Anna!

01:23:37.066 --> 01:23:37.934
You're okay?

01:23:38.879 --> 01:23:39.979
- You're okay?
- Yes.

01:23:40.404 --> 01:23:41.542
- You're okay?
- Yes.

01:23:42.449 --> 01:23:43.124
Yes, daddy.

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:45.845
Are you sure you're okay?

01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:48.044
You're all right?

01:23:48.237 --> 01:23:50.012
Is that bad man gone?

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:52.327
Yeah.

01:23:52.867 --> 01:23:54.410
Yeah, the bad man is gone.

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.282
Okay?

01:24:01.067 --> 01:24:02.958
Banana, you're safe with me now, okay?

01:24:04.636 --> 01:24:05.755
You're safe with me.

01:24:06.063 --> 01:24:06.893
Yeah.

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.970
- All right, banana?
- Yeah. 

01:24:10.674 --> 01:24:11.446
Okay.

01:24:11.851 --> 01:24:12.854
Let's get out of here.

01:24:23.388 --> 01:24:24.430
Oh my God.

01:24:28.211 --> 01:24:29.137
How is she?

01:24:29.851 --> 01:24:30.912
Oh, she's all right.

01:24:31.529 --> 01:24:33.246
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

01:24:34.384 --> 01:24:34.886
Yeah.

01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:36.101
She's okay.

01:24:38.146 --> 01:24:38.995
Oh, Anna?

01:24:39.786 --> 01:24:40.828
This is Jennifer.

01:24:42.063 --> 01:24:42.603
Hi.

01:24:43.336 --> 01:24:44.012
Hi.

01:24:46.983 --> 01:24:48.642
And Jennifer,
this is my daughter, Anna.

01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:55.433
What is it?

01:24:55.684 --> 01:24:56.455
Where are we?

01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:02.591
I will tell you
the whole story later, okay?

01:25:02.842 --> 01:25:03.361
Okay.

01:25:03.362 --> 01:25:05.292
Right now,
I just have one last thing to do.

01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:06.796
And then we gotta go.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.381
Okay.

01:25:09.922 --> 01:25:10.848
You stay right here.

01:25:17.658 --> 01:25:18.797
What are you doing?

01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:23.773
I'm trying to put an end to this.

01:25:56.859 --> 01:25:57.573
Let's go.

01:25:58.344 --> 01:25:59.444
Where are we going?

01:25:59.637 --> 01:26:01.238
Someplace far away from here.

01:26:07.103 --> 01:26:08.415
- You okay?
- Yeah.
