01:15.825 --> 01:17.659
I'll only be about an hour.

01:24.266 --> 01:26.133
It shifted about
an eighth of an inch.

01:26.135 --> 01:27.634
- Which?
- One of the 12s.

01:27.636 --> 01:29.603
Hm, it's not as bad
as I thought, okay.

01:29.605 --> 01:33.107
Hey, Jim owes me $40.
I need a pair of boots.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.476
You okay?

04:56.344 --> 04:57.913
I got this, yeah.

05:19.101 --> 05:22.772
Just...
you do it.

05:23.805 --> 05:25.407
I'm useless.

05:30.846 --> 05:32.281
Okay.

05:46.027 --> 05:47.963
Fuck.

06:00.541 --> 06:04.546
She explicitly asked me
not to be there today.

06:07.115 --> 06:09.149
I'll see you Saturday.

06:09.151 --> 06:12.385
What's Saturday?

06:12.387 --> 06:13.589
The Swan Parade.

06:15.557 --> 06:18.592
Have you gone through
the house recently?

06:18.594 --> 06:20.827
Why?

06:20.829 --> 06:22.027
Alcohol.

06:22.029 --> 06:25.431
Your mother
is not an alcoholic.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.433
She made a mistake.
She paid the price for it-

06:27.435 --> 06:29.969
I was talking
about her parole conditions.

06:29.971 --> 06:32.507
But... thank you.

06:40.449 --> 06:42.849
Have you spoken to her
about selling the house?

06:42.851 --> 06:44.587
Of course I have.

06:47.923 --> 06:49.856
Do you want me
to not ask you

06:49.858 --> 06:51.123
how that conversation went?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.993
If you'd be so kind.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.530
Did Mark move?

07:01.135 --> 07:03.436
Not as far as I know.

07:03.438 --> 07:05.073
Hmm.

07:24.493 --> 07:26.560
Hi, Mama.

07:26.562 --> 07:31.164
Hi.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.620
Yo, how's it going?

07:53.622 --> 07:56.522
- Oh, fantastic.
- Okay.

07:56.524 --> 07:57.626
Uh...

08:00.529 --> 08:03.128
You think about what
you're gonna order for years,

08:03.130 --> 08:05.130
and then, um, wow, you...

08:05.132 --> 08:07.534
It just looks really different
when you see the menu.

08:07.536 --> 08:10.506
Yeah. Did you just
come from Glassmore?

08:11.673 --> 08:14.508
- Yeah.
- Right on.

08:14.510 --> 08:17.077
You must get
a lot of people...

08:17.079 --> 08:20.246
Yeah.
I mean... don't worry.

08:20.248 --> 08:23.183
I won't... won't ask you
what you did or anything.

08:23.185 --> 08:25.519
I'll run you through
the options, though.

08:25.521 --> 08:27.156
We'll get you set up.
We'll get you set up.

09:06.261 --> 09:08.627
Well, all that's missing
is a banner.

09:12.568 --> 09:15.605
- Thirsty?
- I'd kill for a glass of wine.

09:16.738 --> 09:18.507
It's pretty soon, Mom.

09:22.578 --> 09:25.345
Hey, don't sit down.
We're celebrating.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.116
I know you're
probably gonna want

09:30.118 --> 09:33.019
to have a talk with me
at some point.

09:33.021 --> 09:35.755
I'm prepared for that.
I want to as well.

09:35.757 --> 09:39.159
Well, not tonight.
We're celebrating.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.693
Does she know?

09:40.695 --> 09:44.029
We're a little bit
light on glassware.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.635
Um...

09:48.637 --> 09:50.337
okay, um...

09:50.339 --> 09:53.209
good to have me back.

09:58.714 --> 10:00.616
Mmm.

10:11.059 --> 10:12.759
This can all just go
in the trash.

10:12.761 --> 10:15.061
I don't even want to donate it.

10:15.063 --> 10:17.163
Why not donate?

10:17.165 --> 10:19.064
I just don't want to be
walking down the street

10:19.066 --> 10:20.232
and see somebody
else wearing that

10:20.234 --> 10:23.403
and hate it all over again.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.270
Speaking of florals,

10:25.272 --> 10:26.872
Wendy called
like three weeks ago.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.710
She wondered when you
were getting out.

10:30.711 --> 10:32.746
What did she say, exactly?

10:32.748 --> 10:35.151
Um, she wants to see you.

10:36.718 --> 10:38.083
Did you ask her,

10:38.085 --> 10:39.752
or did she bring it up
unprompted?

10:39.754 --> 10:43.255
Um, she called and asked
when you were getting released.

10:43.257 --> 10:45.424
So I told her, and then
I asked her if she wanted

10:45.426 --> 10:48.827
to hang out with you,
and she said yes.

10:48.829 --> 10:50.700
So she didn't suggest it.

10:58.105 --> 11:01.610
Can you pass me that basket,
El? Thank you.

11:07.214 --> 11:09.683
Well, what does it matter
if she suggested it?

11:09.685 --> 11:12.419
I'm not gonna apologize
for being curious.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.688
No one's asking you
to apologize, Mom.

11:14.690 --> 11:16.722
Yeah, I would have to
guess you're wrong about that.

11:16.724 --> 11:18.290
Well, I don't think
that she would call

11:18.292 --> 11:19.893
if she didn't want
to hang out with you.

11:19.895 --> 11:21.461
You're assuming
that I want to see her.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.130
Yeah, and why wouldn't I
assume that?

11:24.132 --> 11:25.698
Is her husband still sick?

11:25.700 --> 11:28.735
He died.
Blood disease.

11:28.737 --> 11:30.437
Well, there you go.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.372
I don't want to be associated
with that kind of sadness.

11:33.374 --> 11:35.942
Okay.

11:35.944 --> 11:38.381
Well, I'm not gonna
force to have friends.

11:45.353 --> 11:47.256
Keep that.
That's nice.

12:59.294 --> 13:00.763
Yeah.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.832
Um, is now a good time?

13:06.834 --> 13:08.233
How do you mean?

13:08.235 --> 13:10.803
Sorry, uh, is now
a good time to talk?

13:10.805 --> 13:13.972
I mean, I don't want to
interrupt your, uh, family time,

13:13.974 --> 13:16.943
but, uh...
it's kind of hard to wait.

13:16.945 --> 13:20.313
I'll understand if you want
to give it more time, for sure.

13:20.315 --> 13:22.450
No. No, no.
Sorry, come in.

13:28.256 --> 13:30.423
Um, can you take
your boots off?

13:30.425 --> 13:32.495
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

13:34.061 --> 13:37.864
- Yep.
- Come on in.

13:37.866 --> 13:42.271
Um... you're not gonna
believe who's here.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.442
Hey, Zoe.

13:51.546 --> 13:53.579
- Eleanor.
- Hi.

13:53.581 --> 13:56.985
- Is it okay if I sit here?
- Oh, of course.

13:59.487 --> 14:02.388
As you can see, everything's
pretty much the same.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.890
It's kind of like
a time capsule.

14:07.896 --> 14:09.529
Do you want
to talk privately?

14:09.531 --> 14:10.929
No, this is okay,

14:10.931 --> 14:13.600
as long as you guys
are okay with it.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.300
- Sure.
- Yeah.

14:15.302 --> 14:16.371
Cool.

14:18.039 --> 14:19.572
So you're still
in the neighborhood.

14:19.574 --> 14:22.875
- How's that?
- Oh, you know, same.

14:22.877 --> 14:25.077
Kind of a time capsule.

14:25.079 --> 14:26.913
Except for
the new subdivision.

14:26.915 --> 14:29.548
- I don't know if you've seen that.
- No.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.417
Anyway, what I wanted
to say was...

14:31.419 --> 14:34.587
I'm sorry, I hate to interrupt.
But here we are, eating.

14:34.589 --> 14:36.325
Just...

14:43.531 --> 14:46.632
So did they legally have to
tell you she was on the loose?

14:46.634 --> 14:49.468
Oh, I don't know what
their obligations were,

14:49.470 --> 14:52.071
- but they did tell me.
- Who told you?

14:52.073 --> 14:53.608
Someone came by.

14:56.610 --> 14:58.544
What have you been doing?

14:58.546 --> 14:59.982
Not a lot.

15:02.349 --> 15:06.151
It's probably all a bit cold.

15:06.153 --> 15:08.087
- Here.
- Thank you.

15:08.089 --> 15:11.459
Um, there's toast.

15:14.161 --> 15:17.163
I didn't ask about your mother.
How is she?

15:17.165 --> 15:20.500
She, um...
she's not with us anymore.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.967
Oh.

15:21.969 --> 15:24.603
I didn't get
all the neighborhood

15:24.605 --> 15:26.505
news updates, I guess.

15:26.507 --> 15:28.507
What I was gonna say before
is that you shouldn't feel,

15:28.509 --> 15:32.077
um, obligated to move out
of the neighborhood

15:32.079 --> 15:34.013
or anything like that.

15:34.015 --> 15:37.516
Oh, I hadn't even thought
about that.

15:37.518 --> 15:39.117
I don't know
if you remember this

15:39.119 --> 15:41.553
but I tried to visit you
in prison a couple of times,

15:41.555 --> 15:44.189
and they told me that you
weren't feeling well.

15:44.191 --> 15:46.558
Yeah, well, I wasn't
feeling well most days.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.395
But I'm really sorry
I didn't get a chance

15:49.397 --> 15:51.496
- to apologize to you.
- Oh.

15:51.498 --> 15:54.600
I didn't know
how to even go about it.

15:54.602 --> 15:56.669
I mean, what do you say
about a thing like that?

15:56.671 --> 15:59.005
But, you know, you had
every right to an apology,

15:59.007 --> 16:00.707
for wanting that apology...

16:00.709 --> 16:03.141
Actually, I didn't come here
looking for an apology.

16:03.143 --> 16:06.412
But thank you, though,
for saying that I deserved one.

16:06.414 --> 16:08.614
Um... I guess I was
just hoping to hear

16:08.616 --> 16:10.549
your account of what happened.

16:10.551 --> 16:13.151
I read everything in the papers,
and the lawyers talked to me,

16:13.153 --> 16:15.587
but everything
happened pretty fast.

16:15.589 --> 16:19.092
And, uh, yeah, I would
just love to hear from you,

16:19.094 --> 16:22.662
in your words,
in the interests of...

16:22.664 --> 16:25.030
closure.

16:25.032 --> 16:27.500
Oh, okay, I don't know
what else I could tell you

16:27.502 --> 16:30.635
that you didn't already read,
but, um...

16:30.637 --> 16:34.439
uh...
I drank and drove.

16:34.441 --> 16:38.678
I was driving too fast
and not paying attention,

16:38.680 --> 16:42.148
and a German Shepherd
bounded out into the street

16:42.150 --> 16:45.617
chasing God only knows what,
and, um...

16:45.619 --> 16:47.587
I made a big mistake.

16:47.589 --> 16:51.057
I panicked and swerved,

16:51.059 --> 16:54.726
and instead of hitting
the dog, I hit...

16:54.728 --> 16:57.099
something else,
as you know.

17:01.536 --> 17:03.604
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I remember.

17:06.207 --> 17:07.508
Okay.

17:10.478 --> 17:12.811
The German shepherd,
I guess that's why the...

17:12.814 --> 17:15.781
the angle of impact
was so extreme.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.486
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.486
Was it the Axels'
German shepherd?

17:21.488 --> 17:24.122
- Sorry?
- The Axels' German shepherd?

17:24.124 --> 17:25.557
From the corner at Radcliffe.

17:25.559 --> 17:28.527
They have the garden gnomes
on the lawn.

17:28.529 --> 17:30.196
Oh, yes, yeah.

17:30.198 --> 17:32.501
Yeah, that's the only big dog
that I can remember.

17:43.545 --> 17:45.710
Sorry, I'm not
trying to be hostile.

17:45.712 --> 17:48.848
No, I'm not either,
and if it's any comfort to you,

17:48.850 --> 17:52.118
I'm... I'm pretty sure
that old dog

17:52.120 --> 17:55.188
would be a pile of dust now
in some landfill

17:55.190 --> 17:58.623
or maybe in their backyard.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.296
- The Axels?
- Yeah, in the Axels' backyard.

18:11.538 --> 18:16.274
I should go.
I should've given you more time.

18:16.276 --> 18:18.844
No, you've waited long enough.
That's fine.

18:18.846 --> 18:20.612
And thanks for breakfast.

18:20.614 --> 18:22.617
Thank you for forgiving me.

18:26.286 --> 18:27.753
I'll see you guys later.

18:27.755 --> 18:30.059
Bye, Mark.

18:41.201 --> 18:42.671
- See you around.
- I hope so.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.584
How did Mark's mother die?

18:59.586 --> 19:01.123
She killed herself.

19:03.290 --> 19:06.659
Maybe you could make a list
of all the other people

19:06.661 --> 19:09.161
who died while I was away.

19:09.163 --> 19:10.865
That would be helpful.

20:40.955 --> 20:45.824
...is about that tall,
you know?

20:45.826 --> 20:49.361
No matter how many times
I pass by your house,

20:49.363 --> 20:51.330
I see you outside there.

20:52.933 --> 20:53.999
You grew.

20:54.001 --> 20:56.835
Guilty.

20:56.837 --> 20:59.272
"Guilty."
That's good.

20:59.274 --> 21:00.505
Guilty as charged.

21:00.507 --> 21:01.907
Yeah.

21:01.909 --> 21:04.744
So what can we
help you with today?

21:04.746 --> 21:07.912
Oh, uh, well,
I was just wondering, um...

21:07.914 --> 21:10.448
you... you used to have
a German shepherd.

21:10.450 --> 21:11.950
Jackson.

21:11.952 --> 21:15.723
Jackson, that's right.
When did he die?

21:18.759 --> 21:19.927
Why?

21:22.830 --> 21:25.765
Okay, well, uh... not sure
if you're aware of this,

21:25.767 --> 21:29.401
but Valerie Walker claimed
that a German shepherd

21:29.403 --> 21:34.073
ran in front of her vehicle
right before she hit my Dad.

21:34.075 --> 21:37.043
I was not aware, no.

21:37.045 --> 21:41.913
Do you... you think Jackson
might have been that dog?

21:41.915 --> 21:43.884
That's why I'm here.

21:47.388 --> 21:48.890
Hmm, well...

21:50.757 --> 21:53.325
What year
was the accident?

21:53.327 --> 21:55.928
- It was 2007.
- 2007.

21:55.930 --> 21:57.365
Hmm.

21:58.565 --> 21:59.968
Hmm.

22:01.869 --> 22:05.338
Hmm.

22:05.340 --> 22:10.911
Well, let's see,
we got him in ninety... um...

22:12.779 --> 22:14.045
When did we get him?

23:19.013 --> 23:20.946
Oh, hi. Valerie.

23:20.948 --> 23:22.480
Jonah?

23:22.482 --> 23:25.886
Yes.
Nice to meet you in person.

23:32.427 --> 23:36.898
Would you happen to have a spade
or a small shovel?

23:52.880 --> 23:55.046
Springtime.

23:55.048 --> 23:58.149
They tend to run head-first
into their own reflections

23:58.151 --> 24:00.619
thinking they're being
protective.

24:00.621 --> 24:02.090
Snap their necks.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.091
Something about their color
makes them prone.

24:06.093 --> 24:08.028
I... I don't know.

24:15.969 --> 24:18.236
I understand that there's
no confidentiality

24:18.238 --> 24:22.541
between myself
and Jonah here.

24:22.543 --> 24:24.476
And do you understand why?

24:24.478 --> 24:26.046
Oh, and I understand why.

24:28.114 --> 24:29.515
Thank you.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.050
Uh, so we're clear,

24:31.052 --> 24:33.552
you said that there's
no confidentiality

24:33.554 --> 24:34.986
- between us and...
- Is that wrong?

24:34.988 --> 24:37.555
No, not wrong,
not incorrect

24:37.557 --> 24:39.925
in the sense
that I have to report

24:39.927 --> 24:41.960
anything incriminating
you might say

24:41.962 --> 24:45.197
but incorrect in that there's
a great deal of confidentiality,

24:45.199 --> 24:48.601
and you can trust that anything
we talk about is private

24:48.603 --> 24:50.535
unless there are
extreme circumstances

24:50.537 --> 24:52.537
where the law
needs to get involved.

24:52.539 --> 24:54.073
Should I just record
that again?

24:54.075 --> 24:56.076
Oh, no need.

25:01.681 --> 25:03.082
I drank green tea for years.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.084
Never knew about
the antioxidants.

25:06.086 --> 25:08.521
Thank you so much
for making a house call.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.959
A perk of you
not having a license.

25:12.959 --> 25:16.227
Is this, uh...
are you new to the field?

25:16.229 --> 25:18.229
No.

25:18.231 --> 25:19.698
Oh.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.699
Never been asked that before.

25:21.701 --> 25:24.104
I just have no
frame of reference.

25:26.207 --> 25:28.172
Uh, so, um... you know,

25:28.174 --> 25:30.642
I have a fair number of
questions that I have to ask you

25:30.644 --> 25:33.078
and others
that I'd like to ask you.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.750
But is there anything
you'd like to ask me?

25:39.085 --> 25:42.220
I'm sorry, I don't have
any more questions.

25:42.222 --> 25:46.024
Okay. So, first off,

25:46.026 --> 25:47.993
is there any chance
of you returning to work

25:47.995 --> 25:49.562
at the plant in any capacity?

25:49.564 --> 25:51.229
I would assume no.

25:51.231 --> 25:53.000
Do you like working in sales?

26:03.577 --> 26:05.143
Is that stuff good?

26:05.145 --> 26:08.613
This? It's the best.

26:08.615 --> 26:11.115
Mmm. I've heard that.

26:11.117 --> 26:12.186
Yeah?

26:13.754 --> 26:16.589
So you have a lawn then?

26:16.591 --> 26:18.193
No, I don't have a lawn.

26:24.198 --> 26:26.265
I like your plaque.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.199
Thanks.

26:28.201 --> 26:32.204
I can put you in touch
with my guy if you want.

26:32.206 --> 26:34.640
You want to walk?

26:34.642 --> 26:36.177
I'm gonna walk.

26:49.323 --> 26:50.755
Where to?

26:50.757 --> 26:53.627
Mm...

26:56.663 --> 26:58.697
You're still married?

26:58.699 --> 27:00.765
Uh, well, yes, technically.

27:00.767 --> 27:03.701
Technically, yeah.

27:03.703 --> 27:05.704
But you're, um...

27:05.706 --> 27:08.273
you'll be staying here
in this house alone?

27:08.275 --> 27:09.874
For now.

27:09.876 --> 27:11.409
You're comfortable
living alone, I assume?

27:11.411 --> 27:13.812
Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.

27:13.814 --> 27:17.682
Um, living alone,
are there any concerns

27:17.684 --> 27:20.084
that come to mind with that?

27:20.086 --> 27:21.756
Carbon monoxide.

27:23.257 --> 27:26.227
Huh.

27:28.828 --> 27:30.862
Seriously,
what do you feel

27:30.864 --> 27:35.234
is the number-one threat
to your freedom?

27:35.236 --> 27:38.607
Well, I guess I would
have to say you, wouldn't I?

27:40.106 --> 27:44.776
Not the answer
I was thinking of, but, uh...

27:44.778 --> 27:47.615
yes, theoretically.

27:49.115 --> 27:52.119
But what would make me
a threat to you freedom?

27:55.789 --> 27:57.790
What about alcohol?

27:57.792 --> 28:01.826
Oh, that's not a threat.
Alcohol won't be an issue.

28:01.828 --> 28:05.264
So, that feels like a mistake
to me, I have to say.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.399
Consider that the only time
your freedom

28:07.401 --> 28:09.701
has been taken from you
was because of drinking.

28:09.703 --> 28:13.471
That works out to 100%.

28:13.473 --> 28:15.407
I'm gonna speak candidly
because I think

28:15.409 --> 28:17.141
it's just going to save us
a lot of time.

28:17.143 --> 28:19.277
Great.

28:19.279 --> 28:21.913
I exaggerated my drinking
during the trial.

28:21.915 --> 28:26.150
I know I drank too much
that night.

28:26.152 --> 28:28.219
But I thought the judge
and jury wouldn't be happy

28:28.221 --> 28:31.156
if I didn't say
I had a problem.

28:31.158 --> 28:36.231
So I just went along with
any language about alcoholism.

28:42.737 --> 28:44.439
Okay, um...

28:46.239 --> 28:48.207
Thank you for your honesty.

28:48.209 --> 28:51.843
Still, you know,
I have a number of clients

28:51.845 --> 28:55.514
who would drink
all the time if they could.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.783
You'd consider that
to be an issue

28:57.785 --> 28:59.985
with alcohol,
wouldn't you?

28:59.987 --> 29:03.455
Well, most of them
haven't taken a life.

29:03.457 --> 29:07.191
So, um, you might understand
how I would see

29:07.193 --> 29:08.927
your relationship
with alcohol as a problem.

29:08.929 --> 29:12.363
No, I understand.
I just wanted to make it clear.

29:12.365 --> 29:14.466
I don't respond well
to alcohol,

29:14.468 --> 29:20.272
which I, you know,
triumphantly proved.

29:20.274 --> 29:23.342
So...
I won't be drinking again.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.009
Okay.

29:25.011 --> 29:27.979
Well, you know, as long
as you meet your conditions

29:27.981 --> 29:32.417
and attend your scheduled
meetings, uh, which start...

29:32.419 --> 29:33.854
Tomorrow.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.422
Yep, uh,
as long as you do that,

29:38.424 --> 29:41.360
then we don't have to talk about
this any further right now.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.031
Okay. Mm-hmm.

29:53.407 --> 29:55.506
They've been
developing this for, like,

29:55.508 --> 29:57.245
three or four years.

29:59.279 --> 30:01.516
I think it's changed hands
a few times.

30:07.020 --> 30:10.522
They're gonna dig
all of this up over here.

30:10.524 --> 30:12.994
A lot of garbage under here,
I think.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.300
I guess when this is all done,

30:21.302 --> 30:23.936
the property values
on your house will go up.

30:23.938 --> 30:26.537
Do you wish we'd sell?

30:26.539 --> 30:28.940
No, did it come across
that way?

30:28.942 --> 30:30.876
A bit.

30:30.878 --> 30:32.476
Well, if that
really mattered to me,

30:32.478 --> 30:34.412
I could just sell my own home.

30:34.414 --> 30:36.415
Well, I'm not sure
that's the same thing,

30:36.417 --> 30:39.554
but whatever you say.

30:43.324 --> 30:45.893
I suppose I kind of embarrassed
myself this morning.

30:53.566 --> 30:55.335
Can I say something sad?

30:57.103 --> 30:59.438
Might as well.

31:01.107 --> 31:03.344
Did you have help
with your mom?

31:07.046 --> 31:10.050
You know, she was pretty good
about hiding it.

31:13.053 --> 31:15.957
I didn't really understand
what was going on, to be honest.

31:22.962 --> 31:25.397
Fuck.

31:25.399 --> 31:28.332
Yeah.

31:28.334 --> 31:30.369
Anybody notice
with your mom?

31:30.371 --> 31:32.004
What do you mean?

31:32.006 --> 31:33.438
With her drinking?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.474
Oh. No.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.378
It was only that one time.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.616
Fuckin' 30 feet from home.

31:45.619 --> 31:49.353
Then came the German shepherd.

31:49.355 --> 31:51.358
Then came the German shepherd.

31:53.393 --> 31:54.495
Yeah.

31:56.063 --> 31:58.999
But not trying to make you
feel sorry for her.

32:03.437 --> 32:04.969
How is she?

32:04.971 --> 32:06.638
My mom?

32:06.640 --> 32:10.609
Uh...
not good with apologies.

32:10.611 --> 32:12.544
It's okay to talk about it,
honestly.

32:12.546 --> 32:14.146
What happened to my family
is way worse

32:14.148 --> 32:17.515
than what happened
to your family.

32:17.517 --> 32:20.584
So it's not like you'll be
making me feel bad or something.

32:20.586 --> 32:25.524
Okay. Um...
well, she's not doing good.

32:25.526 --> 32:29.460
Um...
her friend Wendy's calling,

32:29.462 --> 32:31.095
and she thinks that, like,

32:31.097 --> 32:34.065
she doesn't deserve
to have friends.

32:34.067 --> 32:35.534
I'm sure I didn't
help with that.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.069
No, oh, my God,
it's not your fault.

32:37.071 --> 32:39.040
She should have
fucking apologized.

32:40.407 --> 32:42.040
So Wendy from the plant?

32:42.042 --> 32:44.743
Yeah.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.210
I always liked Wendy.

32:46.212 --> 32:48.115
Yeah, me too.

33:35.129 --> 33:37.728
Is your mother asleep?

33:37.730 --> 33:40.200
Uh, I think so, yeah.

33:41.768 --> 33:43.537
Almond milk?

33:49.075 --> 33:52.544
Did she say that it was okay
for you to stay over tonight?

33:52.546 --> 33:55.647
What difference does
it make if I'm here tonight

33:55.649 --> 33:56.751
or tomorrow morning?

33:59.585 --> 34:01.620
You know, me keeping you updated
about what's happening here

34:01.622 --> 34:05.056
is not a cry for help, right,
you know that?

34:05.058 --> 34:07.258
Yeah,
yeah, I just thought

34:07.260 --> 34:09.795
it would be better
if I was here.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.266
Who let him in?

34:13.232 --> 34:15.766
Mom did.

34:15.768 --> 34:17.735
And... and you think he's...

34:17.737 --> 34:20.308
I don't think that he thinks
it was an accident.

34:22.109 --> 34:24.112
Unfortunately.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.779
Have you talked to her?

34:28.781 --> 34:30.514
No.

34:30.516 --> 34:32.750
She said that she wants to,
but I don't know

34:32.752 --> 34:35.319
what she expects me to say

34:35.321 --> 34:38.291
"Hey, Mom,
you made it worse for me"?

34:40.627 --> 34:42.860
What she's done
shouldn't be on your conscience,

34:42.862 --> 34:44.261
not... not for a second.

34:44.263 --> 34:46.797
Okay.

34:46.799 --> 34:48.699
That's a relief.

34:48.701 --> 34:53.337
Well... if she had
telephoned the police,

34:53.339 --> 34:56.743
Mr. Loekner would be getting
out of prison now.

35:04.817 --> 35:07.754
She's never even admitted to me
that she killed him on purpose.

35:23.303 --> 35:25.772
Sometimes I do feel happy
that he's dead.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.174
But there are other times

35:30.176 --> 35:32.180
when I would just
like to talk about it.

35:35.681 --> 35:37.315
I'd just like
to have that option.

35:37.317 --> 35:39.187
I don't know,
I've read it's...

35:40.721 --> 35:42.290
valuable.

35:45.259 --> 35:47.361
You can talk to me about it.

35:51.797 --> 35:54.602
Do you actually want to listen
to me talk about it?

36:05.678 --> 36:08.348
Am I interrupting?

36:12.386 --> 36:15.719
I had it in my head that
we agreed you'd come tomorrow.

36:15.721 --> 36:19.357
Yeah, yeah.
We had agreed on that, yeah.

36:19.359 --> 36:22.627
Um... I don't have to sleep
here if it bothers you.

36:22.629 --> 36:24.431
No, I don't want
to trouble you.

36:26.265 --> 36:28.766
What time is the Internet
guy coming tomorrow?

36:28.768 --> 36:32.670
Um,
between 10:00 and 12:30.

36:32.672 --> 36:34.241
Okay.

38:11.370 --> 38:12.973
Hi.

38:18.911 --> 38:21.011
It's a... a frittata.

38:21.013 --> 38:22.513
I figured you'd be hungry

38:22.515 --> 38:24.516
after all the work
you've been doing.

38:24.518 --> 38:27.018
I didn't get a chance
to bake it,

38:27.020 --> 38:31.056
so it needs about 25 minutes
at 350, and it should be fine.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.357
I was going to bake it,
but I didn't want

38:33.359 --> 38:35.363
to miss my chance
to give it to you.

38:37.431 --> 38:39.333
That's very nice,
thank you.

38:42.935 --> 38:48.038
I, um... I thought it was
uncomfortable at breakfast.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.841
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I gotta say,

38:49.843 --> 38:53.777
I just don't understand
your fascination with the dog.

38:53.779 --> 38:55.045
That's okay.

38:55.047 --> 38:58.482
You know,
if it was to embarrass me, I...

38:58.484 --> 39:00.387
I'm not trying
to embarrass you.

39:02.922 --> 39:04.491
Well, what then?

39:08.527 --> 39:10.862
You know...

39:10.864 --> 39:15.533
my mom was on a lot
of medication before she died.

39:15.535 --> 39:20.074
But she told me that she thought
she understood what you did.

39:21.841 --> 39:23.808
What do you think that means?

39:23.810 --> 39:26.846
I think it means she was on
a lot of medication.

39:31.484 --> 39:32.553
Maybe.

39:39.826 --> 39:42.530
Okay, great chatting
with you as always.

39:47.033 --> 39:48.933
I'm pretty sure
it's gonna snow.

39:48.935 --> 39:52.840
So it might be a good excuse
for you to go inside now.

41:06.011 --> 41:07.946
What are you measuring?

41:07.948 --> 41:11.482
Uh, it's to optimize
your installation.

41:11.484 --> 41:13.551
Yeah, but how?

41:13.553 --> 41:14.953
So I can put the router here.

41:14.955 --> 41:17.522
What if we want it
in the kitchen?

41:17.524 --> 41:19.123
Sure, yeah, cool.

41:19.125 --> 41:22.092
Could've just told me where you
wanted it off the top,

41:22.094 --> 41:23.596
but it's all good.

41:25.498 --> 41:27.535
How was your night
last night, Zoe?

41:29.669 --> 41:33.071
Uh, okay so just right here
by the, uh, phone?

41:33.073 --> 41:36.074
- It's fine, Greg-
- Yes, thank you.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.674
My night was fine.

41:37.676 --> 41:39.946
Good.
What'd you two talk about?

41:46.620 --> 41:48.589
Is there a problem?

41:51.290 --> 41:54.093
Have you guys talked
about this already?

41:56.161 --> 41:57.962
She has to live
across the street from him.

41:57.964 --> 41:59.531
I know, but I don't
really understand

41:59.533 --> 42:03.600
why you guys don't
feel bad for him.

42:03.602 --> 42:05.036
If there's nothing
to talk about,

42:05.038 --> 42:06.670
there's no need
to get defensive.

42:06.672 --> 42:08.640
There is, though,
'cause all of a sudden,

42:08.642 --> 42:11.775
I feel like
I'm betraying my family.

42:11.777 --> 42:14.078
What are you worried about?
I don't understand.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
I'm only worried
if there's reason to worry.

42:16.082 --> 42:18.719
But if you're telling us not,
that's the end of it.

42:32.299 --> 42:35.169
So, going to the parade still?

42:36.770 --> 42:38.138
Yep.

45:10.756 --> 45:12.158
Can I get you anything, Mom?

45:15.194 --> 45:17.495
- Want some coffee?
- No, I'm fine.

45:17.497 --> 45:18.795
Can I take your coat?

45:18.797 --> 45:20.498
No.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.935
Okay.

45:44.424 --> 45:48.426
Uh, that was Eleanor
who dropped you off?

45:48.428 --> 45:49.493
Yes.

45:49.495 --> 45:51.995
- How's she doing?
- She's well.

45:51.997 --> 45:54.200
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.471
I guess I should come out
with it and...

46:00.473 --> 46:05.342
and tell you I'm sorry
I didn't visit you in there.

46:05.344 --> 46:06.777
No need.

46:06.779 --> 46:08.980
Okay.

46:08.982 --> 46:11.848
So you, uh...
you have a grandson.

46:11.850 --> 46:15.553
I saw the picture.
I didn't know.

46:15.555 --> 46:16.953
- Yeah.
- Ah.

46:16.955 --> 46:19.556
Dylan.
Dill, I call him.

46:19.558 --> 46:21.558
Ah.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.828
Dill.

46:23.830 --> 46:25.495
So that's Kathleen's kid?

46:25.497 --> 46:26.964
Mm-hmm.

46:26.966 --> 46:30.467
Well, I'd like to
meet him some time.

46:30.469 --> 46:31.805
Mmm.

46:37.810 --> 46:40.877
So you're doing crafts.
You work in a craft, like...

46:40.879 --> 46:42.245
Craft store.

46:42.247 --> 46:44.915
- Oh, do you like working there?
- I do, yeah.

46:44.917 --> 46:48.386
And you never thought about
going back to bookkeeping then?

46:48.388 --> 46:50.257
No. No.

46:56.995 --> 46:58.998
When did you quit
at the plant?

47:01.267 --> 47:04.402
Uh, not long after.

47:04.404 --> 47:05.603
A few weeks.

47:05.605 --> 47:08.438
That was fast.

47:08.440 --> 47:09.509
Yeah.

47:14.346 --> 47:19.016
Did anybody ever ask any
questions, like why you quit?

47:19.018 --> 47:24.388
Well... in the normal
process of leaving, sure.

47:24.390 --> 47:28.960
I just said
"personal reasons."

47:28.962 --> 47:31.064
I didn't mean in the company.

47:43.542 --> 47:45.542
Uh, Wendy,
you don't have to do that.

47:45.544 --> 47:48.047
No, it's okay.
Mom doesn't mind.

48:19.478 --> 48:23.080
What do you mean,
you didn't mean the company?

48:23.082 --> 48:28.585
The police?
I didn't talk to the police.

48:28.587 --> 48:31.091
What about Mark Loekner?

48:34.593 --> 48:38.364
No, I have not spoken
to Mark Loekner.

48:50.977 --> 48:52.145
I guess...

48:54.614 --> 49:00.016
I can only guess at
what you saw that day

49:00.018 --> 49:02.987
when you walked
into that room

49:02.989 --> 49:07.060
and the kind of hatred
that would cause.

49:08.527 --> 49:14.000
But I'd rather be 99% sure
than the full 100.

49:15.033 --> 49:17.036
I'm not a good enough liar.

49:20.739 --> 49:22.408
Okay.

49:28.714 --> 49:30.616
I...

49:34.020 --> 49:36.152
Hello, nice to meet you.

49:36.154 --> 49:39.656
Oh, you, too.
That was very polite.

49:39.658 --> 49:40.690
Thank you.

49:40.692 --> 49:42.426
Grandma, I know you said

49:42.428 --> 49:44.594
I wasn't supposed
to come downstairs,

49:44.596 --> 49:47.998
but I can't get the tap
to shut off.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.201
Okay, I'll be up in a sec.

49:50.203 --> 49:52.105
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:59.578 --> 50:00.680
Now I met him.

50:09.455 --> 50:11.591
Let's try this again
on another day.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.694
I think you should
give Eleanor a call

50:16.696 --> 50:18.464
before she gets too far.

50:20.198 --> 50:22.168
The phone's
where it always was.

50:59.571 --> 51:01.638
How'd it go?

51:01.640 --> 51:02.742
Funny.

51:12.151 --> 51:15.252
I think one of us
needs to tell Mark.

51:15.254 --> 51:16.120
No.

51:16.122 --> 51:17.687
Yes.

51:17.689 --> 51:19.656
- It would destroy him.
- I think he needs to know.

51:19.658 --> 51:23.627
I think that it's going
to be brutal at first,

51:23.629 --> 51:25.261
and it will be a lot
to contend with,

51:25.263 --> 51:27.163
but I think that's it gonna
give him somewhere

51:27.165 --> 51:30.669
to direct his anger
other than just at you.

51:33.872 --> 51:37.276
I'd rather he direct
his anger at me.

51:42.681 --> 51:45.683
I don't think that that's
going to be good enough.

51:45.685 --> 51:47.154
Okay, that's fine.

51:52.692 --> 51:54.692
At what point do I get
to call the shots

51:54.694 --> 51:56.096
on what happened to me?

52:00.700 --> 52:02.699
Well, if we tell him,

52:02.701 --> 52:06.705
it'll implicate me for murder,
you realize.

52:08.373 --> 52:11.574
No I don...
what's he gonna do?

52:11.576 --> 52:14.745
Go around and tell everybody
that his father's a rapist?

52:14.747 --> 52:16.315
What if he does?

52:18.216 --> 52:20.618
Well, he...
what does he say?

52:20.620 --> 52:21.721
Just...

52:25.757 --> 52:27.757
I'll handle Mark.

52:27.759 --> 52:30.261
Okay, you'll handle him.

52:30.263 --> 52:32.598
You're gonna make him
another fucking casserole.

52:34.700 --> 52:36.169
It was a frittata.

53:04.763 --> 53:06.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:06.232 --> 53:08.299
- I'm Mark Loekner.
- Hi, I'm Karen.

53:08.301 --> 53:11.368
- I thought you might be.
- Yeah, nice to see you.

53:11.370 --> 53:12.969
I didn't think you were Karen.

53:12.971 --> 53:14.871
- So you gonna join us?
- That's right, yeah.

53:14.873 --> 53:16.674
- If that's all right.
- Absolutely.

53:16.676 --> 53:18.641
I'm not sure if there's
anything I need to sign.

53:18.643 --> 53:20.710
Oh, yeah, there's...
But we can do that after.

53:20.712 --> 53:22.379
Make yourself comfortable.

53:22.381 --> 53:24.982
We've got some coffee
over there and some treats.

53:24.984 --> 53:27.717
- You can meet everybody.
- Great, sounds great.

53:27.719 --> 53:30.390
- Thanks very much.
- Well, thank you for coming.

53:53.312 --> 53:56.813
Oh, that's empty.
The last of it's in here.

53:56.815 --> 53:59.817
Someone had the good idea
to make a pot of decaf.

54:06.692 --> 54:08.424
Is it okay that I'm here?

54:08.426 --> 54:10.960
I've been meaning to come
to these meetings for some time.

54:10.962 --> 54:14.832
But I never imagined I'd pick
the same one as you.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.303
Are you can alcoholic?

54:17.736 --> 54:19.439
I don't know. Are you?

54:23.709 --> 54:24.977
Showtime.

54:51.469 --> 54:53.272
Why are you staring
at the ground?

54:55.341 --> 54:58.978
I think someone maybe buried
that bird that hit the window.

55:07.886 --> 55:09.886
Do you think Mom did that?

55:09.888 --> 55:11.490
How would I know?

55:18.797 --> 55:20.864
What happened this morning?

55:20.866 --> 55:24.567
I just... I don't think
that we should underestimate

55:24.569 --> 55:25.902
how angry Mark might be.

55:25.904 --> 55:27.770
We shouldn't
underestimate him?

55:27.772 --> 55:30.373
Do you think that, like,
pretending he doesn't exist

55:30.375 --> 55:32.542
is gonna like,
pacify him or something?

55:32.544 --> 55:34.377
No, but I think it's okay
that she asked you

55:34.379 --> 55:36.382
what you guys talked about.

55:38.049 --> 55:40.516
Okay, cool.

55:40.518 --> 55:43.453
I'm not gonna, like,
beg for answers here.

55:43.455 --> 55:45.522
But just let me know
whenever you think

55:45.524 --> 55:48.027
I can handle whatever
you're not telling me.

55:54.100 --> 55:57.600
Sorry, I don't
exactly know what to say.

55:57.602 --> 56:02.473
Uh, didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

56:02.475 --> 56:05.408
Was kind of counting on a cup
of coffee to get me through,

56:05.410 --> 56:07.411
but, uh, I guess somebody
thought it would be a good idea

56:07.413 --> 56:09.446
to put on a pot of decaf.

56:11.917 --> 56:14.585
Um...

56:14.587 --> 56:18.955
so I started drinking
after my mom, um,

56:18.957 --> 56:20.556
took her own life.

56:20.558 --> 56:24.895
She didn't cope well
with my father's death.

56:24.897 --> 56:27.931
And he was, uh,

56:27.933 --> 56:31.100
run over
in front of our house

56:31.102 --> 56:35.575
by a friend of his
who was drunk.

56:38.444 --> 56:41.645
So, uh, my mom waited
until I was 18.

56:41.647 --> 56:46.417
Until I was a an adult,
I guess, and, uh...

56:47.585 --> 56:50.857
well,
she decided to clock out.

56:53.591 --> 56:56.592
Drinking seemed like the adult
way to handle that, I guess.

56:56.594 --> 56:59.929
And, uh...

57:01.167 --> 57:04.868
I don't really
talk about it a lot,

57:04.870 --> 57:07.073
but I would like to start.

57:09.174 --> 57:13.479
So I guess that's...
what I have to say.

57:15.647 --> 57:17.681
Well,
that's a fine first go.

57:17.683 --> 57:23.953
Your story of loss was not
only heard...

57:23.955 --> 57:25.658
but listened to.

57:28.893 --> 57:30.594
Well, I'll be honest.

57:30.596 --> 57:34.897
I'm thinking a Band-Aid
ripping type situation

57:34.899 --> 57:37.000
might be best here,

57:37.002 --> 57:39.636
i.e., newbie number two

57:39.638 --> 57:42.605
having her first kick
at the can.

57:42.607 --> 57:43.910
How about it?

57:48.480 --> 57:50.913
Not right now, I don't think.

57:50.915 --> 57:54.153
Oh, okay. Anybody else?

57:55.488 --> 57:57.056
Liam.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.556
Yep.

58:33.558 --> 58:36.225
Jonah is here.

58:36.227 --> 58:39.164
I-I put him
at the dining room table.

58:41.634 --> 58:43.600
Tomorrow morning,
I think you should come

58:43.602 --> 58:45.101
to the other house.

58:45.103 --> 58:47.270
- To your house?
- Yeah.

58:47.272 --> 58:49.672
No, I'm gonna stay here,
I think.

58:49.674 --> 58:51.308
Okay, if you're
concerned about me

58:51.310 --> 58:53.109
getting the wrong idea,
don't be.

58:53.111 --> 58:55.112
I'll go to a hotel.

58:55.114 --> 58:56.749
No, I'm gonna stay here.

59:05.156 --> 59:07.593
I'll tell him
you'll be down in a sec.

01:00:24.803 --> 01:00:28.071
I dropped my daughter off
at her mother's on the way here,

01:00:28.073 --> 01:00:29.672
and she had
some colleagues over,

01:00:29.674 --> 01:00:32.808
and she offered me
some of the finger foods.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.312
Okay.

01:00:35.314 --> 01:00:37.681
Jim, help yourself
to any of these.

01:00:37.683 --> 01:00:39.415
I can't even eat most of them
on account of the fact

01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:41.217
that I can't eat lactose,
there's...

01:00:41.219 --> 01:00:44.353
Thanks. Appetite's
been promised elsewhere.

01:00:44.355 --> 01:00:47.790
Going out to get some Chinese,
give you guys some privacy.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:50.359
- Girls?
- Chinese is a great choice.

01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:52.429
Valerie,
I'll pick something up for you.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.364
Sure.

01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:57.833
You want some, Jonah?

01:00:57.835 --> 01:01:00.170
Uh, no, no.
Thanks, though.

01:01:00.172 --> 01:01:01.608
Positive?

01:01:04.176 --> 01:01:07.844
What are the chances they have
a beef and black bean sauce?

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:10.382
Yeah, yeah, they got that.
It's one of my faves.

01:01:13.185 --> 01:01:15.252
Yes, I'll have it.
Thank you.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.788
- Okay, good.
- You know, what? Uh, no.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.190
I don't know if I'll be here
when you get back.

01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:22.795
- Thank you, though.
- Okay, suit yourself.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.777
I don't need to explain to you
why I'm here, I don't think.

01:01:40.779 --> 01:01:43.116
Yes I know.
It won't happen again.

01:01:47.185 --> 01:01:48.884
You see, um,
you told me that alcohol

01:01:48.886 --> 01:01:50.353
wouldn't be a problem,

01:01:50.355 --> 01:01:53.359
but I classify leaving
a meeting as a problem.

01:01:56.428 --> 01:01:58.395
You need to understand
that this is technically

01:01:58.397 --> 01:02:00.897
a violation of your terms.

01:02:03.368 --> 01:02:05.304
- May I?
- It's fine.

01:02:07.872 --> 01:02:10.272
- Did the group leader...
- Karen?

01:02:10.274 --> 01:02:12.408
Did she tell you
what happened?

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.780
She told me you got up
and left.

01:02:16.748 --> 01:02:20.484
Do you remember
the man that I hit?

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:22.284
Uh, Michael Loekner.

01:02:22.286 --> 01:02:25.223
Right.
His son was there.

01:02:26.457 --> 01:02:28.794
- His son was...
- At the meeting.

01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:33.797
Oh.

01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:35.268
I'll be right back.

01:02:49.814 --> 01:02:54.817
I came to apologize.
I-I... I crossed the line.

01:02:54.819 --> 01:02:56.920
I should have left
as soon as I saw you there.

01:02:56.922 --> 01:02:59.025
And I didn't, and I'm sorry.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.493
I do want to talk to you

01:03:03.495 --> 01:03:06.364
about what's appropriate
and what's not.

01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:10.833
But right now's
not a good time.

01:03:10.835 --> 01:03:13.370
Oh, uh, well, Jim and your
daughters just drove by me

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:15.272
so I thought now would
be a a good time.

01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:16.940
No, it's not a good time.

01:03:16.942 --> 01:03:19.009
If I may...

01:03:19.011 --> 01:03:21.310
I couldn't help but overhear.

01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:25.882
You must be Michael's son.
My name's Jonah.

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:28.551
Mark, how are you?

01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:30.886
My condolences.

01:03:30.888 --> 01:03:32.823
Thanks?

01:03:32.825 --> 01:03:36.393
Mark, this is my parole officer,
if you hadn't already guessed.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:39.261
I heard about the meeting.

01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:42.531
Yeah, unfortunate,
um, overlap there.

01:03:42.533 --> 01:03:44.069
I'll say.

01:03:46.071 --> 01:03:48.839
You know,
this is a good opportunity.

01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:51.875
Address this thing head on,
and while your life, Mark,

01:03:51.877 --> 01:03:55.344
is none of my business,
the parts that now intersect

01:03:55.346 --> 01:03:58.582
with this case,
with Valerie...

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:00.051
they become it.

01:04:02.053 --> 01:04:04.420
- They become it?
- Become part of my business.

01:04:04.422 --> 01:04:06.890
What... what I'm saying is
if you two are gonna have

01:04:06.892 --> 01:04:09.292
a discussion about boundaries,
let's do it the right way.

01:04:09.294 --> 01:04:10.897
I can mediate.

01:04:15.033 --> 01:04:18.000
That's a seafood puff pastry,

01:04:18.002 --> 01:04:20.103
and that is a homemade
spanakopita,

01:04:20.105 --> 01:04:21.605
which my ex-wife's

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:26.076
girlfriend Carey described
earlier to me, as divine.

01:04:26.078 --> 01:04:28.047
- Great.
- Yes.

01:04:31.116 --> 01:04:33.917
So, uh, Mark, tell...
tell me about today.

01:04:33.919 --> 01:04:37.520
Were you aware that Valerie
was gonna be at the meeting?

01:04:37.522 --> 01:04:41.024
Because if you were there
for the sake of sobriety,

01:04:41.026 --> 01:04:44.361
of course, I'm all for that,
but looking at it

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:46.629
from another way
could easily point

01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:50.335
to a catastrophic invasion
of privacy.

01:04:51.569 --> 01:04:54.670
Well, I did want
to go to the meeting.

01:04:54.672 --> 01:04:58.109
But I also did have an idea
that Valerie might be there.

01:05:00.011 --> 01:05:01.944
I've been holding
onto a lot anger.

01:05:01.946 --> 01:05:04.413
As soon as she left,
I realized

01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:08.150
I'd made a big mistake
in how to go about handling it.

01:05:08.152 --> 01:05:12.355
Okay. So what are we
gonna do about it?

01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:15.158
My opinion is we need
more information,

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.592
more transparency.

01:05:16.594 --> 01:05:18.627
Can I suggest a topic
for us to discuss,

01:05:18.629 --> 01:05:20.496
- or is there a...
- In a way.

01:05:20.498 --> 01:05:22.498
These things
tend to work better

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.634
with fewer
personal elements at play.

01:05:25.636 --> 01:05:30.375
If you'll indulge me,
I'm gonna give you these cards.

01:05:37.582 --> 01:05:40.616
If you have a question
that you're struggling

01:05:40.618 --> 01:05:43.987
to ask out loud,
you write it on the card,

01:05:43.989 --> 01:05:49.725
and I'll read it out,
and, uh... like a buffer.

01:05:49.727 --> 01:05:53.096
Then we can discuss calmly.
Does that sound...

01:06:12.183 --> 01:06:14.417
"How did you feel
about my father?"

01:06:14.419 --> 01:06:16.685
Uh, I'm speaking on
Mark's behalf, obviously.

01:06:16.687 --> 01:06:20.022
I wouldn't expect you to have
feelings about my father.

01:06:20.024 --> 01:06:21.693
Not many people do.

01:06:24.562 --> 01:06:28.063
Can I, um... yeah.

01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:30.433
Michael was great.
He was funny.

01:06:30.435 --> 01:06:32.701
He had a very dry
sense of humor.

01:06:32.703 --> 01:06:37.676
He was very polite to me.
He was a warm man.

01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:42.045
You weren't at the funeral.

01:06:42.047 --> 01:06:45.181
Well, I thought it would
be selfish to show my face.

01:06:45.183 --> 01:06:46.583
That makes sense.

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:48.717
I'm guessing you remember
Wendy Barnes?

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:50.252
- You guys were friends, right?
- Yeah.

01:06:50.254 --> 01:06:51.654
She she didn't show up either.

01:06:51.656 --> 01:06:53.223
Everyone else
from the plant was there.

01:06:53.225 --> 01:06:57.594
Was that some kind of
a solidarity thing or...

01:06:57.596 --> 01:06:59.261
I don't know.

01:06:59.263 --> 01:07:01.096
Then she quit like
two weeks after.

01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:04.734
I'm just... I guess I hope
she handled everything okay.

01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:10.075
- Have you seen her yet?
- Yeah.

01:07:14.078 --> 01:07:15.680
Did you want to get that?

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:23.089
I'll be right back.

01:07:31.629 --> 01:07:34.763
You have one new voice...

01:07:34.765 --> 01:07:37.100
First voice message.

01:07:37.102 --> 01:07:39.238
Val, um...

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:42.675
Mark came to my house.

01:07:44.308 --> 01:07:47.580
He asked if you had
a reason for killing Michael.

01:07:54.518 --> 01:07:56.522
I didn't say anything,
but...

01:07:59.091 --> 01:08:00.759
I wasn't prepared.

01:08:04.796 --> 01:08:06.129
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.172 --> 01:08:15.672
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:17.740
A friend of mine's
gonna visit here soon,

01:08:17.742 --> 01:08:20.109
and she's got...
we've got nine possible plans

01:08:20.112 --> 01:08:21.310
for us to do together...

01:08:21.313 --> 01:08:23.779
Am I allowed to ask you
a question?

01:08:23.782 --> 01:08:25.548
All right.

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.716
Um...

01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:30.719
Have you ever heard
of a case in which a person

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.721
committed a crime in car
and then drank after the fact,

01:08:33.724 --> 01:08:39.328
to make it seem like they'd
just been drinking and driving?

01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:41.563
The person was sober before?

01:08:41.564 --> 01:08:43.832
- That's right.
- Not that I can think of.

01:08:43.835 --> 01:08:49.171
So does anybody ever
question drunk driving or...

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.176
Uh, question how?

01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:54.676
Well, let's say you wanted
to kill someone, right?

01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:56.678
You could just go ahead
and do it and say,

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.714
"Yep, I did it,"
you could do that.

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:01.683
Or, you could try to claim
that you were mentally ill.

01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:04.386
But then there's a whole...
what, a vetting process,

01:09:04.389 --> 01:09:06.755
and you run the risk
of being institutionalized

01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:09.892
- or medicated...
- This seems to be getting off topic.

01:09:09.894 --> 01:09:11.792
No, no, it's the topic.

01:09:11.795 --> 01:09:14.796
So, hypothetically,
let's just say that Valerie

01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:17.332
wanted to kill my father,
which we know isn't true,

01:09:17.335 --> 01:09:20.868
because she thought he was warm,
but let's just say she did.

01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:22.938
She saw him.
She ran him down.

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:27.343
Could she not then drink
after the fact,

01:09:27.345 --> 01:09:29.648
plead guilty
to a lesser charge?

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.721
Well, I'm not sure
what the point would be.

01:09:40.724 --> 01:09:43.959
She swerves from a dog,
hits someone,

01:09:43.961 --> 01:09:46.627
six months' jail, maybe.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:48.700
Well,
pretend there's no dog.

01:09:53.337 --> 01:09:56.705
Well, there would need
to be motive.

01:09:56.707 --> 01:09:59.344
Otherwise,
people make mistakes.

01:10:01.779 --> 01:10:05.380
What would be her motive?
Hypothetically.

01:10:05.382 --> 01:10:07.883
Well, yeah,
I mean, that's... that's...

01:10:07.885 --> 01:10:10.255
that's just it, isn't it?

01:10:19.264 --> 01:10:20.963
I'm getting
the distinct feeling

01:10:20.965 --> 01:10:24.267
that I was missing some context
before I suggested talking,

01:10:24.269 --> 01:10:25.704
the three of us.

01:10:28.872 --> 01:10:31.740
Do you want me to fill him in,
or do you want to?

01:10:31.742 --> 01:10:32.678
Go ahead.

01:10:34.446 --> 01:10:39.414
Mark thinks I'm lying.
That's very clear to me now.

01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:42.884
And I should've told you,
but I didn't want to alarm you,

01:10:42.886 --> 01:10:44.721
and I didn't think
he'd come over here and make

01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:46.489
- a fool out of himself.
- You have lied.

01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:49.359
Why would you give details about
something you weren't sure...

01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:52.695
The dog? That's the big lie
you've uncovered?

01:10:52.697 --> 01:10:54.830
Well, the dog, the cat,
the fucking hamster

01:10:54.832 --> 01:10:56.732
you swerve around
is inconsequential

01:10:56.734 --> 01:10:58.500
- when you're drunk.
- But you weren't drunk, though.

01:10:58.502 --> 01:11:00.969
What didn't you understand
about the penalty being worse

01:11:00.971 --> 01:11:01.971
for driving drunk?

01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:03.772
Why would I drink after?

01:11:03.774 --> 01:11:06.342
So you wouldn't
be charged with murder!

01:11:06.344 --> 01:11:07.977
And if you drink beforehand,
you you run the risk

01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:10.012
of missing your target,
I mean, come on!

01:11:10.014 --> 01:11:13.516
You don't accelerate towards
somebody unless you're trying

01:11:13.518 --> 01:11:15.785
- to commit murder...
- I'm gonna show you to the door now.

01:11:15.787 --> 01:11:17.719
Maybe we can all meet
in a more controlled setting

01:11:17.721 --> 01:11:19.321
once you both
have calmed down.

01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:21.227
Hang on a second.

01:11:32.836 --> 01:11:34.739
Could you sit down, please?

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.321
Jonah, I'm sorry that you
had to be here for this.

01:12:15.779 --> 01:12:17.049
Why?

01:12:40.404 --> 01:12:44.309
Jonah, I got you some of that black bean...

01:12:45.844 --> 01:12:48.878
Oh. Stay back girls.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.051
Will the three of you come
into this room here, please?

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:59.558
And, um, put your phones
on the table and have a seat?

01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:10.035
Thank you.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.055
Do they know?

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.990
I mean,
I'm guessing Jim knows, right?

01:13:34.992 --> 01:13:36.558
Mark, what are you doing?

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.195
Oh, uh, your mom
killed my dad on purpose.

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:41.530
Wendy Barnes told me.

01:13:41.532 --> 01:13:43.134
Wendy didn't say anything.

01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:52.008
Mom, you tell him right now
or I will.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:55.043
- Eleanor.
- Tell me what?

01:13:55.045 --> 01:14:00.016
Mark... it's time
to go home, son.

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:02.154
Don't call me that.
Tell me what?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.689
Mom?

01:14:19.069 --> 01:14:20.605
Nothing.

01:14:22.607 --> 01:14:24.042
Wow.

01:14:33.651 --> 01:14:36.552
You took
my fucking family from me.

01:14:36.554 --> 01:14:39.658
The least you can do
is tell me why.

01:14:46.997 --> 01:14:48.533
Mark...

01:14:57.175 --> 01:15:00.109
I think we should all just
take a moment and reassess.

01:15:00.111 --> 01:15:01.546
No...

01:15:37.148 --> 01:15:38.750
BB gun.

01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:46.121
Are you okay?

01:15:46.123 --> 01:15:48.024
Think I should get
to a hospital.

01:15:48.026 --> 01:15:49.691
May have nicked a vein.

01:15:49.693 --> 01:15:52.227
Get... get me my phone.

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:54.065
I'll get a towel.

01:15:58.569 --> 01:16:01.803
Hi, could I get
an ambulance to 240 Dunsmere?

01:16:01.805 --> 01:16:04.774
Someone has been shot
in the neck by a... a BB,

01:16:04.776 --> 01:16:07.778
and a young man has been struck
in the head by a blunt object.

01:16:11.616 --> 01:16:15.520
Road, 240 Dunsmere Road.
Okay, bye.

01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:26.797
Is what Mark said the truth?

01:16:29.834 --> 01:16:31.569
Yeah.

01:17:08.272 --> 01:17:10.207
You okay, Zoe?

01:19:04.788 --> 01:19:06.454
Diana, now,
before I deliver

01:19:06.456 --> 01:19:09.325
the bad news for Canadians,
know that the US

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:12.328
is facing cold,
brutal weather as well.

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.763
In Waco, Texas,
drivers are having trouble

01:19:14.765 --> 01:19:17.399
getting traction
on all of the major roads,

01:19:17.401 --> 01:19:19.968
and people are being asked
to stay inside their homes

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:23.938
until road crews
can solve the problem.

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.874
Further north,
downed power lines

01:19:25.876 --> 01:19:28.944
have cut off electricity to
thousands in much of Michigan

01:19:28.946 --> 01:19:31.780
where, over the past week,
there's been a record number

01:19:31.782 --> 01:19:34.383
of school closures
for the month of April.

01:19:34.385 --> 01:19:36.852
Our country is finished
with what are likely

01:19:36.854 --> 01:19:39.888
its most significant systems
until next winter,

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:42.357
but there are several
other systems on the way

01:19:42.359 --> 01:19:45.360
that could cause significant
trouble and concern.

01:19:45.362 --> 01:19:48.030
The Pacific flow threatens
to bring uncomfortable weather

01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:51.834
to our west coast, including
the metro Vancouver area,

01:19:51.836 --> 01:19:53.968
where heavy amounts
of snow will be followed

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:55.503
by heavy amounts of rain.

01:19:55.505 --> 01:19:58.473
Luckily we have some
warm weather and rain...

01:19:58.475 --> 01:20:01.509
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:04.879
It's a very
different story for Ontario.

01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:07.850
We have watches and warnings
nearly everywhere on the map

01:20:07.852 --> 01:20:11.954
due to the Texas flow
in Alberta...

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:26.684
