14:51.558 --> 14:53.393
IT'S NOT EVEN
A FELONY AMOUNT!

14:53.426 --> 14:55.328
- [grunts] THAT WEED'S THE LEAST
OF YOUR PROBLEMS.

14:55.362 --> 14:59.332
- [crying] DON'T TAKE HIM!
HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING!

14:59.366 --> 15:01.201
- I'M GOING TO
DRIVE BY,

15:01.234 --> 15:04.237
YOU TELL ME IF YOU SEE
THE MAN THAT RAPED YOU.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.276
- THAT'S HIM.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.378
- ARE YOU SURE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.146
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE THE SON OF A BITCH IN.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.183
- COPY THAT.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.126
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO MS. CABOT?

15:26.159 --> 15:27.294
- CALLED AWAY,
YOUR HONOR.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.295
ROSE CALLIER,
FOR THE PEOPLE.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.997
- STATEMENT?
- YOUR HONOR,

15:30.030 --> 15:31.564
THE DEFENDANT
FORCIBLY RAPED SARAH WALSH

15:31.598 --> 15:33.300
AT GUNPOINT
IN HER APARTMENT.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.368
HE HAS NO JOB
OTHER THAN DEALING DRUGS.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.504
THE PEOPLE SUGGEST BAIL
BE SET AT $50,000.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.405
- RESPONSE?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.474
- YOUR HONOR,
MY CLIENT, TOM O'BRIEN--

15:41.508 --> 15:43.977
- HIS NAME IS MICHAEL!
- WHAT?

15:44.011 --> 15:47.314
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- MICHAEL. WEDMORE.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.315
- RIGHT.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.549
SORRY,
YOUR HONOR.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.152
UH, THIS ONE JUST, EH--

15:52.185 --> 15:53.286
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.222
- ORDER IN THE COURT!
SIT DOWN.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.524
COUNSELOR, YOU NEED TIME
TO GET YOUR CASE ORGANIZED?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.326
- JUST A SECOND,
YOUR HONOR.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.562
- [whispers] YOU GOTTA ASK
FOR A NEW LAWYER.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.497
- JUDGE, CAN I
GET A NEW LAWYER?

16:04.531 --> 16:07.500
- MR. WEDMORE, YOU ARE ENTITLED
TO A COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEY.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.303
YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED
TO YOUR CHOICE OF ATTORNEY.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.239
CAN YOU AFFORD TO
HIRE A LAWYER?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.074
- WE HAVE A LAWYER,
YOUR HONOR.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.308
- MOM?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.344
- BAYARD ELLIS?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.546
COUNSELOR, TO WHAT
DO WE OWE THIS PRIVILEGE?

16:19.579 --> 16:22.382
- I'M HERE TO REPRESENT
MICHAEL WEDMORE...PRO BONO.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.484
- YOUR HONOR--
- IF IT PLEASES THE COURT.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.254
- THIS SUITABLE TO YOU,
MR. WEDMORE?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.355
- YEAH.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.291
- SO ORDERED.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.492
- WILL HE GET OUT
ON BAIL?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.061
- BAIL'S SET
AT $50,000.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.530
THAT SHOULD HOLD HIM.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.798
HEY, MIKE.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.800
SARAH, THIS IS
BUREAU CHIEF MIKE CUTTER.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.170
HE'S GONNA BE
THE LEAD PROSECUTOR ON THE CASE.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.338
- SARAH.
- BUREAU CHIEF?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.506
IS THIS BECAUSE
OF BAYARD ELLIS?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.108
WHY IS HE TAKING
THE CASE?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.776
- OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.212
JUST MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO
VET EVERY DETAIL.

16:52.245 --> 16:56.516
PLEASE,
TAKE A SEAT.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.817
[door closes]

16:57.850 --> 17:02.455
SO LET'S START
WITH THE SECURITY TAPE.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.791
NOW, THE, UH,
THE ASSAILANT ENTERED

17:04.824 --> 17:06.459
THE ELEVATOR
WITH YOU.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.496
CAN I ASK WHY YOU
HELD THE DOOR FOR HIM?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.298
- I JUST--

17:11.331 --> 17:13.133
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK
I WAS A RACIST.

17:13.166 --> 17:17.270
- OKAY.
THAT'S...FINE.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.238
NOW...

17:18.271 --> 17:22.109
ON THE TAPE,
YOU APPEAR TO BE TALKING TO HIM.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.544
- HEY, NEW GUY.
GOOD WORK LAST NIGHT.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.779
- OH,
JUST GOT LUCKY.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.747
THIS DUMB KID
DIDN'T KNOW

17:27.780 --> 17:29.582
BETTER THAN TO WORK
HIS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.850
- CAN'T BE THAT DUMB.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.419
HE'S GOT BAYARD ELLIS
DEFENDING HIM.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.353
- WHA--WHO'S THAT?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.123
- HE'S THE GO-TO LAWYER
FOR DRUG KINGPINS.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.857
- USED TO BE
UNTIL ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.261
HE WON A HUGE CIVIL SUIT,
WALKED AWAY, TOOK THE MONEY,

17:41.294 --> 17:43.430
AND STARTED THE NEW YORK CENTER
FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.365
- TRYING TO BUY
A CLEAN CONSCIENCE.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.268
ASK ME, HE'S STILL JUST PUTTING
CRIMINALS BACK ON THE STREET.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.303
- ONLY IF WE DON'T
DO OUR JOB.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.372
ANY FUNNY BUSINESS
LAST NIGHT?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.306
GOOD.
OKAY.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.774
SO GO FIND OUT WHAT
HE'S GOING TO FIND OUT

17:54.807 --> 17:57.177
BEFORE HE FINDS IT OUT.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.512
- AFTER YOU SHOWERED,
DID YOU CALL ANYONE?

17:59.546 --> 18:02.415
YOUR BOYFRIEND?
- NO.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.485
- BUT YOU HAVE ONE?

18:05.518 --> 18:08.488
- YES.
- HIS NAME?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.856
- SARAH?

18:09.889 --> 18:14.394
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.862
- UH, I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.532
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
INVOLVED.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.534
HE'S MY PIANO TEACHER
AT THE SCHOOL.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.571
HE COULD LOSE
HIS JOB.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.409
- HAS SHE HAD
A PERFORMANCE?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.377
- UH, YEAH.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.846
SARAH HAD A JURY PERFORMANCE
TWO DAYS AGO.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.782
SHE WAS AMAZING.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.186
- OH, WAS THAT DIFFERENT
THAN NORMAL?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.853
- YOU KNOW, MUSICIANS
ARE A LOT LIKE BOXERS.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.555
THEY TEND TO EXCEL
MORE QUICKLY

18:42.589 --> 18:45.158
IF THEY'RE
FROM HARDER BACKGROUNDS.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.393
SHE'S FROM LONG ISLAND.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.360
- HUH.

18:47.394 --> 18:52.432
NOW, DID YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING OFF ABOUT HER?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.468
- SHE JUST ACCEPTED HER PRAISE
AND HUSTLED OUT.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.938
PLAYING THAT HARD CAN BE
EMOTIONALLY DRAINING.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.373
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.544
- SARAH?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.813
SARAH.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.250
- WHAT? UH, SORRY,
WH--UM...

19:10.283 --> 19:11.318
WHAT DID YOU ASK?

19:11.351 --> 19:14.521
- THE LAST TIME YOU HAD SEX
BEFORE THE INCIDENT.

19:14.554 --> 19:18.458
- UH, TWO WEEKS AGO.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.926
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING
ON MY MUSIC.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.528
[knock at door]

19:21.561 --> 19:23.530
- LIV, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.566
- EXCUSE ME.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.937
WHAT'S UP?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.440
- WE WENT BACK TO THE BAR
WHERE SARAH SPOTTED HER PERP.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.575
TURNS OUT SHE WAS THERE
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.277
- YEAH, I KNOW. SHE TOLD ME.
SHE HAS A FAKE I.D.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.478
SHE HAD A BEER.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.413
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE WAS HITTING IT

19:40.447 --> 19:41.581
A LITTLE BIT HARDER
THAN THAT.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.483
SHE WAS PLAYING
AIR KEYBOARDS,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.419
SINGING ALONG
TO PIANO MAN.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.488
- OKAY.
ANYTHING ELSE?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.458
[knock at door]

19:51.491 --> 19:52.492
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:52.525 --> 19:56.796
- SO, SARAH,
YOUR BARTENDER SAYS

19:56.829 --> 19:58.298
THAT HE SAW
YOU DRUNK

19:58.331 --> 19:59.966
AND FLIRTING
WITH A GUY

19:59.999 --> 20:02.535
THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOU WERE ATTACKED.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.337
WAS THAT
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.838
- NO.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.241
IT WAS JUST SOME GUY
AT THE BAR.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.410
I WAS STRESSED ABOUT, UH,
THE RECITAL.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.279
- DID YOU GO HOME
WITH THIS GUY?

20:12.312 --> 20:15.415
- NO.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.817
AND I DON'T LIKE BEING TREATED
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.452
- WELL, NOBODY'S JUDGING YOU,
HONEY.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.489
- WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD
ANY SURPRISES.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.529
- YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THAT DETECTIVE?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.398
- UM...NO.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.500
- [sighs]
WHAT THE HELL--

20:33.533 --> 20:35.468
YOU'VE BEEN SECRETIVE,
DISTANT.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.403
ARE YOU SEEING
SOMEONE?

20:36.436 --> 20:40.273
- NO, PAUL.

20:40.307 --> 20:45.044
[sighs]
I WAS RAPED.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.482
IN MY APARTMENT
TUESDAY.

20:49.516 --> 20:53.320
- OH, GOD.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.555
- I MEAN, AT LEAST
I'M PLAYING BETTER, RIGHT?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.591
- I-I-I'M SO SORRY.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.832
I-I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU
TO MOVE THERE.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.036
- [scoffs]
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.371
AT ALL!

21:11.404 --> 21:14.441
- SARAH.

21:14.474 --> 21:18.478
- COUNSELOR ELLIS.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.814
- HAVE WE MET?
- SERGEANT JOHN MUNCH.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.450
I ADMIRE
YOUR SECOND ACT.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.918
- UM, I'M NOT SURE
I GET THE JOKE.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.487
- I'M NOT JOKING.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.490
YOU CAN BE N.Y.P.D.
AND BELIEVE IN CIVIL LIBERTIES.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.559
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.626
- I'M ABOUT TO PUT THAT
TO THE TEST.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.061
- OKAY.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.565
- UH, MR. ELLIS IS HERE
ON BEHALF OF MICHAEL WEDMORE.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.032
- THE, UH,
ELEVATOR SURVEILLANCE TAPE.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.033
I'LL NEED A COPY
OF THAT.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.336
ALSO THE U.F. 250s
FROM THE STOP AND FRISKS.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.537
- WAIT, WHAT?

21:44.571 --> 21:45.838
- UH,
DETECTIVE,

21:45.872 --> 21:47.574
TWO NIGHTS AGO,
SEVERAL YOUNG BLACK MEN

21:47.607 --> 21:49.342
IN HAMILTON HEIGHTS
WERE STOPPED AND FRISKED

21:49.376 --> 21:51.611
BY A BLONDE FEMALE
AND BLACK MALE DETECTIVE TEAM.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.946
THAT WOULD BE YOU AND, UH--
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.948
WE WERE LOOKING
FOR A RAPIST AT LARGE.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.084
- YOU CAN TELL
SOMEONE'S A RAPIST

21:58.117 --> 22:00.520
BY STOPPING
AND FRISKING THEM?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.855
I'LL NEED A REPORT
ON EACH INDIVIDUAL STOPPED.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.525
- ROLLINS, FIN,
TAKE COUNSELOR ELLIS

22:05.558 --> 22:06.325
INTO THE INTERVIEW ROOM,

22:06.359 --> 22:07.860
AND BRING HIM
WHATEVER HE NEEDS.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.061
- RIGHT THIS WAY,
COUNSELOR.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.531
- IT MAY TAKE A WHILE FOR US
TO GET THE REPORTS IN ORDER.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.500
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
YOUR PARTNER HERE...

22:13.533 --> 22:16.536
I'M SURE
SHE KEEPS GOOD NOTES.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.509
- YOU THINK A GUY LIKE THAT
REALLY FOUND RELIGION?

22:22.542 --> 22:25.111
- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN
RAPE...OR THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.381
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
TELL ME ABOUT THE GUN BUST.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.516
- IT'S CLEAN.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.585
I'VE WORKED NARCOTICS, WARRANTS.
DONE HUNDREDS OF THESE.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.855
- AND I'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF
DROPSY CASES GET THROWN OUT.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.425
- WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING, COUNSELOR?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.393
- I'M ASKING THE QUESTION.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.830
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.499
- DETECTIVE SECOND GRADE
NICHOLAS AMARO.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.501
HE THREW THE GUN
UNDER THE COUCH.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.036
I RETRIEVED IT.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.971
NOW, I'M NOT SURE
IF THE GIRL WAS RAPED.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.841
BUT I DO KNOW
THERE WAS A GUN.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.043
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM HERE.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.545
PUT 'EM AWAY.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.447
- IT'S NOT PERSONAL,
DETECTIVE.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.347
ELLIS WINS THIS CASE,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.950
IT'S NOT JUST OPEN SEASON
ON MY OFFICE

23:03.983 --> 23:06.118
BUT ALSO N.Y.P.D.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.688
OKAY?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.566
- HEY, OLIVIA.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.967
IT'S NICK.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.437
- HEY.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.106
- HEY. UH,
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU--

23:27.139 --> 23:29.576
I'M--I'M NOT, UH--
- NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.843
COME IN.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.011
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.050
- THIS IS A NICE SPOT.
- UH, YEAH.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.619
THANK YOU.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.190
ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT'S UP?

23:44.223 --> 23:46.192
- YOU KNOW THIS, UH, CUTTER?

23:46.225 --> 23:47.860
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON HIM?

23:47.894 --> 23:50.563
- CUTTER, HE'S A GOOD LAWYER.
HE'S DEDICATED.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.599
- TO HIS BATTING AVERAGE
OR THE TEAM?

23:52.632 --> 23:55.502
- OH, NO. HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.837
BUT HE KNOWS THAT WE ARE...

23:57.870 --> 23:59.438
IN FOR A BATTLE.

24:01.974 --> 24:06.579
- ARE WE CLEAR
ON WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE GUN?

24:06.613 --> 24:08.481
- YEAH. YOU YELLED, "GUN,"
AND I DREW ON HIM.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.117
- YEAH, BUT YOU SAW HIM

24:43.315 --> 24:46.018

YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER
AND I LOVE IT

25:58.057 --> 25:59.626
WHEN YOU STAY WITH US

WE MISS
OUR LITTLE GIRL.

HONEY?

26:06.633 --> 26:09.135
- UM, I'M--
I HAVE TO GO.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.171
I'M L--
I'M LATE FOR PRACTICE.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.882
- I HEARD WEDMORE
POSTED BAIL.

26:22.915 --> 26:23.916
HOW'S YOUR GIRL?

26:23.950 --> 26:25.217
- SHE WANTS TO GO
AT IT ALONE.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.286
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.055
- WHAT IS SHE, 20?
- 19.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.122
- GOD.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.924
REMEMBER WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE STRONG ENOUGH,

26:31.958 --> 26:35.327
YOU COULD HANDLE ANYTHING
BY YOURSELF?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.663
WHAT'S UP, SERGEANT?

26:36.696 --> 26:38.297
- ELLIS IS DOING
HIS DUE DILIGENCE.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.365
- AND THEN SOME.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.633
HE'S MOVED
FOR A MAPP HEARING

26:40.667 --> 26:42.234
ON THE RECOVERY
OF THE GUN.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.403
YOU'LL BOTH NEED TO TESTIFY.
- WELL, I'M READY.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.072
- HE'S ALSO MOVED
FOR A WADE HEARING,

26:46.105 --> 26:47.940
CHALLENGING THE FAIRNESS
OF THE I.D.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.677
- THAT WOULD BE YOU TWO AGAIN,
AS WELL AS FIN AND ROLLINS.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.678
YOU CAN CARPOOL.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.680
- THAT WAS
GOOD POLICE WORK.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.947
WHAT'S THIS GUY
TRYING TO DO?

26:54.981 --> 26:58.651
- DEATH BY
A THOUSAND PAPER CUTS.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.268
- [sighs]

27:16.302 --> 27:18.404
- WE CONDUCTED
A SHOW-UP IDENTIFICATION

27:18.437 --> 27:21.708
WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME OF
THE VICTIM SEEING THE SUSPECT.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.043
IT'S STANDARD
N.Y.P.D. PROCEDURE.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.678
- WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING
MR. WEDMORE IN FOR A LINE-UP?

27:25.712 --> 27:26.979
- YOUR HONOR,
THE COURT

27:27.013 --> 27:29.982
HAS UPHELD SHOW-UP IDs
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.083
- MY CLIENT
WAS I.D.'D

27:31.117 --> 27:32.985
WHILE HANDCUFFED AND
STANDING WITH THE DETECTIVES.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.120
IT'S INHERENTLY
SUGGESTIVE.

27:34.153 --> 27:38.958
- THE VICTIM WAS HELD BY
HER RAPIST FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.194
SHE HAS GOOD EYESIGHT.
IT'S A CLEAN I.D.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.896
- YOUR HONOR, THE NEW JERSEY
STATE SUPREME COURT

27:43.930 --> 27:46.432
HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
A TROUBLING LACK OF RELIABILITY

27:46.465 --> 27:48.367
IN EYEWITNESS
IDENTIFICATIONS,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.402
PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING
A DIFFERENCE IN RACE.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.371
- THIS IS NOT
NEW JERSEY.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.306
I'M GOING TO AGREE
WITH THE PROSECUTION.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.343
MOTION DENIED,
THE IDENTIFICATION STANDS.

[playing classical music]

28:02.414 --> 28:09.121
*

28:15.061 --> 28:17.363
- HE CONTINUED
INTO THE JEFFERSON PROJECTS,

28:17.396 --> 28:19.498
RAN UP THE STAIRS
INTO HIS APARTMENT,

28:19.531 --> 28:22.434
HE TRIED TO SLAM
THE DOOR ON ME.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.136
THEN I TOOK HIM DOWN.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.504
- DID YOU SEE HIM
THROW THE GUN?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.239
- I SAW HIM
FLING HIS ARM,

28:27.273 --> 28:28.240
AND I HEARD IT SLIDE
ACROSS THE FLOOR.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.909
- YOU HEARD IT?

28:29.942 --> 28:32.144
WITH THE CHILD CRYING,
MR. WEDMORE'S FAMILY SCREAMING?

28:32.178 --> 28:36.182
- YES, AND I SAW IT
GO UNDER THE COUCH.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.051
- DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A GUN,
OR THINK IT WAS A GUN?

28:39.085 --> 28:43.923
- I KNOW WHAT
A GUN IS.

28:43.956 --> 28:44.824
- DID YOU SEE THE GUN,
DETECTIVE?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.926
- IT WAS CHAOTIC,
THEY WERE SCREAMING.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.895
THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY THERE,
IT WAS VERY DARK--

28:48.928 --> 28:49.996
- YES OR NO?

28:50.029 --> 28:52.064
AND I REMIND YOU,
YOU'RE UNDER OATH.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.900
- NO.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.902
I HEARD MY PARTNER YELL,
"GUN."

28:55.935 --> 28:58.437
SO I PULLED MY WEAPON,
AND I HELD IT ON A SUSPECT

28:58.470 --> 28:59.906
WHILE HE RESTRAINED HIM.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.440
YOUR HONOR,
MR. WEDMORE WAS IN CUSTODY.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.909
HE WAS NOT A THREAT.

29:02.942 --> 29:03.910
THE POLICE HAD ALREADY
SECURED THE ROOM.

29:03.943 --> 29:04.977
THEY SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED
A SEARCH WARRANT.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.414
YOUR HONOR, THE DETECTIVE
HAD REASONABLE CAUSE.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.416
THE PLAIN VIEW DOCTRINE
APPLIES HERE.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.918
- PLAIN VIEW? UNDER THE COUCH?
ACROSS THE R--

29:11.951 --> 29:13.920
- MOTION DENIED.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.154
MOVING ON.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.128
- THANKS FOR HAVING MY BACK.
- [sighs]

29:22.161 --> 29:27.399
I CAN'T SAY THAT I SAW
SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T SEE.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.436
- THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW...
PARTNER.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.307
- WE'VE GOT
THE RIGHT MAN.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.043
- NOT THE RIGHT WAY.

29:37.076 --> 29:41.347
- LOOK, THERE'S
NO BIG CONSPIRACY HERE.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.414
WHAT'S IN THIS
FOR YOU?

29:42.448 --> 29:44.450
- NOTHING, BUT
IF IMPROPRIETIES HAPPEN

29:44.483 --> 29:45.517
ON ORDINARY CASES
LIKE THIS,

29:45.551 --> 29:47.253
THAT MEANS THEY HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.356
- SO YOU'RE GONNA USE THIS CASE
TO DECLARE WAR ON THE N.Y.P.D.?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.458
- THE N.Y.P.D. DECLARED WAR
ON YOUNG MEN OF COLOR

29:52.491 --> 29:53.525
A LONG TIME AGO.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.928
500,000 STOP AND FRISKS
IN ONE YEAR?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.463
- THAT SON OF A BITCH
RAPED HER.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.934
- LAST I HEARD, EVEN IF
A BLACK MAN IS ACCUSED OF RAPE,

30:01.968 --> 30:04.971
THE BURDEN OF PROOF
IS STILL ON THE STATE.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.943
- YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
YOUR PHONE.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.446
I CAN'T HAVE YOU UPSETTING
YOUR MOTHER LIKE THIS.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.916
YOU KNOW HOW
SHE GETS.

30:16.949 --> 30:20.920
- I'M SORRY.
I'LL CALL HER LATER.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.189
- I KNOW I'VE BEEN STRICT
WITH YOU.

30:23.222 --> 30:26.058
THAT CAN ONLY EXPLAIN
YOUR CHOICE

30:26.092 --> 30:28.360
TO LIVE IN
THIS GODFORSAKEN NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:28.394 --> 30:32.031
BUT DON'T PUNISH
YOUR MOTHER FOR THAT.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.101
- UH, DADDY?

30:43.009 --> 30:44.143
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:44.176 --> 30:47.179
- [crying] DADDY,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.918
- OH.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.954
- [sobs]

31:00.993 --> 31:03.129
- EVIDENCE
OF VAGINAL FISSURES

31:03.162 --> 31:05.531
CONSISTENT
WITH FORCIBLE INTERCOURSE.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.267
BUT NO FOREIGN DNA
ON HER PERSON.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.501
- WELL, SHE SHOWERED.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.503
SO IT WAS WORTH
A SHOT.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.040
- I DID FIND MICHAEL WEDMORE'S
DNA ON THE CUP.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.074
ANYTHING ON THE BED?

31:15.107 --> 31:18.044
- YES, FRESH SEMEN
WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE RAPE.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.947
- THAT'S GREAT.
WE GOT HIM.

31:20.980 --> 31:25.084
- IT'S NOT
MICHAEL WEDMORE'S DNA.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.485
- HER BOYFRIEND?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.520
SHE TOLD US SHE HADN'T HAD SEX
WITH HIM IN TWO WEEKS.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.322
- WASN'T HIM EITHER.

31:30.356 --> 31:33.025
- ARE YOU SURE?

31:33.059 --> 31:36.228
NO-NO-NO, THIS DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

31:36.262 --> 31:41.100
SHE TOLD US--
[sighs]

31:41.133 --> 31:44.503
THEN WHO THE HELL
WAS IT?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.275
- I DON'T REMEMBER
HIS NAME.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.178
IT WAS JUST
A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.180
- WAS IT THE GUY
FROM THE BAR?

31:54.213 --> 31:56.115
- YES.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.317
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
HE'S BLACK.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.120
- YEAH.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.022
- DID YOU TAKE
THE ELEVATOR?

32:03.055 --> 32:07.126
- YEAH.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.165
- WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU
ABOUT THIS.

32:13.199 --> 32:16.168
- I'VE NEVER PICKED ANYONE UP
AT A BAR BEFORE.

32:16.202 --> 32:18.304
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
IT MIGHT LOOK BAD.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.372
- WHAT LOOKS BAD IS THAT
YOU LIED TO US.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.142
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
STUDYING MUSIC IS HARD.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.377
YOU'RE ALONE,
YOU'RE PRACTICING ALL THE TIME.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.047
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW I
ENDED UP DATING MY TEACHER.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.149
- THERE GOES RAPE SHIELD.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.317
- WAIT, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

32:31.350 --> 32:34.220
- YOUR LIE IS IN A REPORT
THAT WE GAVE TO THE DEFENSE.

32:34.253 --> 32:38.524
- WE HAVE TO
INFORM THEM.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.459
- ELLIS IS GONNA TRY TO USE
THE OTHER MAN'S DNA

32:40.492 --> 32:42.228
TO CREATE
REASONABLE DOUBT.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.563
- I WAS JUST
TRYING TO BE

32:44.596 --> 32:48.534
A NORMAL COLLEGE KID
FOR ONCE.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.237
[scoffs]
SO WHAT?

32:51.270 --> 32:54.073
DOES THIS MEAN THAT
YOU DROP THE CASE?

32:54.106 --> 32:57.009
- NO, HE STILL RAPED YOU
AT GUNPOINT.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.745
- BUT YOU'RE SAYING
THE JURY WON'T BELIEVE ME.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.981
- JUST TELL THE TRUTH,
AND LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE REST.

33:06.152 --> 33:09.088
- ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON,
SARAH WALSH

33:09.121 --> 33:12.358
ENTERED HER APARTMENT
WITH HER GROCERIES.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.526
WHEN SHE TURNED TO CLOSE
HER FRONT DOOR,

33:14.560 --> 33:18.164
SHE FOUND THE DEFENDANT
POINTING A GUN AT HER.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.033
- DO YOU OWN A GUN?
- NO.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.268
- HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE GUN

33:22.301 --> 33:24.236
THE DETECTIVES ALLEGEDLY FOUND
IN YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT?

33:24.270 --> 33:27.239
- ALL I KNOW IS, WHILE
ONE OFFICER HELD ME AT GUNPOINT,

33:27.273 --> 33:29.775
THE OTHER ONE PULLS
THIS GUN OUT OF NOWHERE

33:29.808 --> 33:31.243
AND SAYS,
"YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN."

33:31.277 --> 33:33.779
- HAD YOU EVER SEEN
THAT GUN BEFORE?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.814
- NO. LOOK,
I MAY BE A POT DEALER,

33:35.847 --> 33:38.317
BUT THAT'S JUST SO I CAN PROVIDE
FOR MY FAMILY.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.485
I DEAL SMALL QUANTITIES.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.287
MISDEMEANORS.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.223
EVERYBODY KNOWS
A GUN IS A FELONY.

33:44.256 --> 33:47.326
- MR. WEDMORE HELD HER
AT GUNPOINT.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.096
HE LOCKED THE DOOR.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.263
SHE OFFERED HIM A BEER,

33:51.297 --> 33:54.166
HOPING THAT THE KINDNESS
WOULD KEEP HIM FROM KILLING HER.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.369
- WERE YOU IN
MISS WALSH'S APARTMENT?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.505
- YES. I HELPED HER
IN WITH HER GROCERIES.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.141
SHE OFFERED ME
A BEER.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.811
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME
TO STAY AWAY FROM WHITE WOMEN.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.147
BUT SHE SEEMED NICE,
SO I TOOK IT.

34:08.180 --> 34:08.980
- HE WOULDN'T LEAVE.

34:09.014 --> 34:12.351
WITH THE GUN
STILL POINTED AT HER,

34:12.384 --> 34:15.221
SHE OFFERED HIM MONEY.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.223
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE WANTED.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.757
- AFTER SHE INVITED YOU
INTO HER APARTMENT,

34:18.790 --> 34:21.560
OFFERED YOU A BEER,
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

34:21.593 --> 34:23.429
- I WANTED TO GO.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.531
I HAD TO GET BACK
TO WORK.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.099
THEN SHE STARTED
ACTING WEIRD.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.534
- HOW SO?

34:28.567 --> 34:31.237
- SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.506
- HE TOLD HER
TO UNDRESS

34:34.540 --> 34:37.476
AND LAY
ON THE BED.

34:37.509 --> 34:42.214
SARAH,
FEARING FOR HER LIFE,

34:42.248 --> 34:45.117
DID AS SHE WAS TOLD.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.285
- DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH HER?

34:46.318 --> 34:49.321
- NO.
I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.562
- YOU OKAY?

34:56.595 --> 35:00.766
- YOUR FRIEND ELLIS TRIED TO
SHAKE MY STORY ON THE GUN.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.967
HE THREW IT
UNDER THE COUCH.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.136
THERE WAS A KID IN THE HOUSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

35:04.170 --> 35:06.238
- I GET IT. WE'VE ALL BEEN
THERE, HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.774
NEXT TIME, CUFF HIM,
SEAL THE ROOM,

35:08.807 --> 35:11.810
AND WAIT FOR A WARRANT,
OKAY?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.915
- MISS WALSH, IS THIS YOU WITH
MY CLIENT IN YOUR ELEVATOR?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.584
- YES.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.187
- AND YOU CLAIMED YOU'VE NEVER
MET MY CLIENT BEFORE?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.053
- THAT'S CORRECT.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.322
- ARE YOU SURE?
YOU LOOK SO FRIENDLY.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.224
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.925
AN HOUR LATER...

35:26.958 --> 35:29.195
IS THIS
MY CLIENT LEAVING?

35:29.228 --> 35:30.429
- YES.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.199
- NO TORN CLOTHING, NO SIGNS
OF STRUGGLE. WOULD YOU AGREE?

35:33.232 --> 35:36.235
- YES.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.312
- AFTER MY CLIENT LEFT,
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

35:46.345 --> 35:48.314
OR A FRIEND?
- AFTER HE RAPED ME, I--

35:48.347 --> 35:50.349
- YOU DIDN'T CALL ANYONE,
DID YOU?

35:50.382 --> 35:51.383
- NO.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.185
- NO. INSTEAD,
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.786
YOU PERFORMED
A PIANO RECITAL.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.921
- I HAD TO
FOR THE GRADE--

35:55.954 --> 35:58.924
- AND YOU GOT AN "A."
IMPRESSIVE.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.260
CONSIDERING HOW LATE
YOU WERE OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.861
3:00 A.M.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.897
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN,
MISS WALSH?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.236
- YES.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.471
- DID YOU INVITE HIM
INTO YOUR APARTMENT?

36:19.245 --> 36:20.812
- YES.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.515
- AND YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM ON
YOUR BED THAT NIGHT, DID YOU?

36:23.549 --> 36:24.983
- YES.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.852
- IS IT POSSIBLE
THE INJURIES YOU SUSTAINED

36:26.885 --> 36:28.520
WERE FROM VIGOROUS SEX
WITH THIS MAN

36:28.554 --> 36:30.256
BEFORE YOU MET
MY CLIENT?

36:30.289 --> 36:32.324
- IT WASN'T ROUGH.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.825
IT WAS CONSENSUAL--

36:33.859 --> 36:36.828
- WOULD THIS MAN BE ABLE TO COME
FORWARD AND TESTIFY TO THAT?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.933
- NO.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.604
- AND WHY IS THAT?

36:45.637 --> 36:48.874
- I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.876
- ON THE TAPE, HE LOOKS
VERY SIMILAR TO MY CLIENT.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.444
MID-20s, ATHLETIC BUILD,
BLACK.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.380
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
THE DEFENSE--

36:54.413 --> 36:57.015
- REPHRASE. IS IT SAFE TO SAY
YOU HAVE A TYPE, MISS WALSH?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.517
- WATCH YOURSELF,
MR. ELLIS.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.885
- WITHDRAWN.
MISS WALSH,

36:59.918 --> 37:01.987
WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO FILE A POLICE REPORT?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.356
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.024
- ANYONE?

37:06.057 --> 37:10.462
YOU MEAN,
YOUR PARENTS?

37:10.496 --> 37:12.331
OR YOUR BOYFRIEND?

37:12.364 --> 37:13.399
- YES.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.967
- SO YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW

37:16.001 --> 37:17.469
YOU WERE ALONE
WITH MY CLIENT,

37:17.503 --> 37:18.904
OR YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO LET THEM KNOW

37:18.937 --> 37:20.939
YOU WERE ALONE WITH SOME RANDOM
MAN THE NIGHT BEFORE?

37:20.972 --> 37:23.975
THE ONE WHO LEFT HIS SEMEN
ON YOUR SHEETS?

37:27.078 --> 37:30.282
WHICH IS IT,
MISS WALSH?

37:32.484 --> 37:35.421
TAKE YOUR TIME.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.457
IT IS CONFUSING.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.833
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS ISN'T 1970.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.835
IT'S 2011.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.837
AND YET YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT
FROM THE WAY

37:51.870 --> 37:55.841
THE DEFENSE IS PUTTING THE
VICTIM'S PERSONAL LIFE ON TRIAL.

37:55.874 --> 38:00.412
IT'S THE DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS
THAT MATTER HERE.

38:00.446 --> 38:03.081
NOW, HE ADMITS TO BEING
IN THE BUILDING

38:03.114 --> 38:06.017
BUT CLAIMS HE WAS ONLY THERE
TO DELIVER POT.

38:06.051 --> 38:10.088
HE ADMITS ENTERING
MISS WALSH'S APARTMENT

38:10.121 --> 38:12.891
BUT CLAIMS
HE JUST HAD A BEER.

38:12.924 --> 38:16.061
BUT WHAT
HE WON'T ADMIT

38:16.094 --> 38:19.465
IS THE HORRIBLE TRUTH...

38:19.498 --> 38:21.367
THAT IN LESS THAN
AN HOUR,

38:21.400 --> 38:25.404
AT GUNPOINT,

38:25.437 --> 38:28.440
HE IRREVOCABLY CHANGED
A YOUNG WOMAN'S LIFE.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.149
- MR. FOREMAN.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.886
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT
YOU HAVE COME TO A DECISION.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.321
- YES,
YOUR HONOR.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.093
ON THE CHARGE OF
CRIMINAL POSSESSION OF A WEAPON,

38:48.126 --> 38:49.428
WE FIND
THE DEFENDANT

38:49.461 --> 38:54.065
NOT GUILTY.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.567
ON THE CHARGE
OF RAPE,

38:55.601 --> 38:57.369
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
NOT GUILTY.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.107
- YOU BLACK BASTARD!

39:02.140 --> 39:05.343
[gavel bangs]
- ORDER!

39:09.114 --> 39:12.584
- SARAH--
- DON'T!

39:12.618 --> 39:14.553
DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME THAT
THAT WAS WORTH IT.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.388
THAT WAS SO UGLY!

39:16.422 --> 39:18.957
- SARAH, YOU DIDN'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.826
YOU ACCUSED HIM
IN PUBLIC--

39:20.859 --> 39:21.827
- SO WHAT?

39:21.860 --> 39:26.164
HE'S GOING HOME
WITH HIS FAMILY.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.100
I WOULD HAVE NEVER
LET ANYONE GO THROUGH THAT.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.136
- THAT'S TRUE, AND I KNOW THAT
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW--

39:31.169 --> 39:32.838
- NO, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW I FEEL!

39:32.871 --> 39:35.073
- SARAH,
LISTEN TO ME.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.410
SENDING HIM TO PRISON

39:38.444 --> 39:41.046
ISN'T GONNA HEAL YOU.

39:41.079 --> 39:45.116
HEALING BEGINS WHEN
SOMEONE BEARS WITNESS.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.019
I SAW YOU.

39:48.053 --> 39:52.491
I BELIEVE YOU.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.527
- COME ON, BABY.
LET'S GO.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.967
- CONGRATULATIONS.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.003
- THANK YOU.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.049
- [sighs]

40:20.952 --> 40:23.121
I DIDN'T ASK
FOR COMPANY.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.991
- BUT YOU GOT IT.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.894
- ARE YOU PROUD
OF YOURSELF?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.630
YOU BROUGHT UP
EVERY STEREOTYPE.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.065
YOU SHAMED THAT GIRL
ABOUT HER SEXUALITY.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.235
YOU SAID THAT IF A WHITE GIRL
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CRIES RAPE,

40:37.268 --> 40:40.539
SHE MUST HAVE WANTED IT?
NICE WORK.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.041
- AND YOUR CASE?
THE I.D.?

40:43.074 --> 40:45.110
THE GUN YOUR PARTNER HEARD
SLIDE UNDER THE COUCH?

40:45.143 --> 40:46.845
NO DNA?

40:46.878 --> 40:49.548
IF MICHAEL WERE WHITE, THIS
NEVER WOULD'VE GONE TO TRIAL.

40:49.581 --> 40:50.982
- OH, WOW.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.018
YOU'RE STILL PLAYING
THE RACE CARD, HUH?

40:53.051 --> 40:57.055
- 84% OF THE YOUNG MEN IN NEW
YORK JAILS ARE BLACK AND LATINO.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.289
- HE RAPED HER!

40:58.323 --> 41:00.659
- SO SHE SAYS. WE DON'T KNOW.
NEITHER ONE OF US WAS THERE.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.228
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO
IS BELIEVE OUR PEOPLE,

41:03.261 --> 41:05.497
AND WE DO IT
WITHOUT QUESTION.

41:05.531 --> 41:08.133
- SO THAT'S IT.

41:08.166 --> 41:12.070
YOU'RE A TRUE BELIEVER.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.005
- I AM.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.975
AND SO ARE YOU.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.910
- I JUST DO MY JOB.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.513
- LOOK, NOT EVERYONE
IN THE N.Y.P.D.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.981
IS LIKE YOU, DETECTIVE.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.616
I WISH THEY WERE.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.251
I COULD RETIRE.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.654
THIS JOB,
FIGHTING THIS HARD, IT--

41:28.687 --> 41:32.257
WIN OR LOSE,
IT COMES WITH A COST.

41:32.290 --> 41:38.063
WE BOTH KNOW THAT,
DON'T WE?

41:38.096 --> 41:39.531
- YOU KNOW,
I LOOK AT THE UNIS,

41:39.565 --> 41:40.999
ALL THESE KIDS
IN THE SQUAD ROOM,

41:41.032 --> 41:46.071
AND ALL
I CAN THINK OF

41:46.104 --> 41:48.039
IS I'M SO TIRED.

41:48.073 --> 41:51.276
- I GET IT.

41:51.309 --> 41:54.512
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LIVE FOR THE JOB.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.654
YOU NEED AN ESCAPE.

42:02.688 --> 42:04.856
I COACH MY DAUGHTER'S
SOFTBALL TEAM.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.893
- THAT MUST BE HELL
ON THE UMP.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.998
- WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT
AND CATCH A GAME?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.601
- I DO OKAY
ON MY OWN.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.637
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
