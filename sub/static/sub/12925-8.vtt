of humor, it just--

01:35.933 --> 01:38.867
it really tickles me sometimes.

that last year's winner...

01:41.767 --> 01:45.533
is doing a Noah's Ark float this
year, with real animals.

This means we have got
to step up our build!

the same one you used last year?

tunic...

11:48.067 --> 11:50.533
I mean, we may not
have a semi...

11:50.633 --> 11:54.700
but I got my trusty blue cruiser
here and you know what?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.933
That baby's got 500 pounds
of torque...

11:57.067 --> 11:58.867
nearly 300 horses at the wheel.

11:58.967 --> 12:02.333
Anybody else thinkin' what
I'm thinkin'?

12:02.433 --> 12:05.733
Duct tape it to the top
of the Caddy! Right?

12:05.833 --> 12:09.100
I mean, am I crazy or what?

12:11.833 --> 12:14.067
There you go!
That ought to do it.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.733
Great work, pastor. You did it!

12:16.833 --> 12:20.633
We all did it. We looked
adversity straight in the face..

12:20.733 --> 12:23.733
and we said, "You can die and go
straight to hell adversity!"

12:23.833 --> 12:25.600
Amen!
Amen!

12:25.700 --> 12:26.633
Now get on out of here.

12:26.733 --> 12:27.933
You're gonna want a good seat...

goes cruising by.

12:33.067 --> 12:34.733
Here you go, Hot Rod.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.067
Wait, you want me to drive?

12:37.133 --> 12:39.067
Yeah, figure now's as good
a time as any...

12:39.167 --> 12:41.233
to get in a good driving lesson.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.633
It's probably the worst...

12:42.733 --> 12:45.233
but I'll never turn down
an opportunity to drive.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.067
Hey, just promise
you'll be real careful.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.267
I don't want anything happening
to my baby girl.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.900
See, that'd be kind of sweet...

about your car.

for, babies?

13:16.433 --> 13:21.067
It obviously wasn't made for
somebody with my muscular frame.

what kind of knot was that?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.600
Monkey fist.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.167
That might have been it.

14:51.267 --> 14:53.733
My dad tried to teach me that
knot when I was a kid...

14:53.833 --> 14:56.700
but then he died.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.233
Sorry to hear about that. My dad
wasn't around much, either.

You know, now I don't even
have pictures of him.

blurry and far away.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.367

do you have a harpoon gun?

15:43.667 --> 15:45.767
Because the dude at your

15:45.867 --> 15:49.067
said I had to wait seven days
in order to buy a handgun.

De-parting, because I'm gonna
kill you with it.

don't find it amusing...

is the best medicine, Vern.

why it is they call you Starman.

men stars.
