You're a ball-buster, you know that?

40:20.160 --> 40:24.051
Yup. And you're an arrogant,
insubordinate prick.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.641
Here. I got you a souvenir.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.650
I've gotta know one thing.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.322
Would you have let us all die
for the sake of these? Huh?

40:36.760 --> 40:39.809
I wouldn't have lost any sleep over you.

40:40.040 --> 40:43.647
I know who Christy Bryant is,
and I know what you did for the CIA.

Just how well do you sleep at night?

Fuck you.

That's what my report says.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.322
As you proved on this mission...

41:26.520 --> 41:29.524
...secrecy was always more important
than success.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.124
Well, I'm waiting.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.449
I downloaded documents
from the Libyan's laptop.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.648
Dodgy export licenses...

41:38.840 --> 41:42.765

to known human-rights violators...

originating from British factories.

I wouldn't want to find my name on there.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.601
This was never about hostages.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.886
Now, I am happy to give them to you
if you give Section 20 a clean bill of health...

41:58.080 --> 42:00.765
...because anyone seriously contemplating
shutting down...

42:00.960 --> 42:04.806

and this committed is a fucking--

42:05.040 --> 42:07.202
- Captain, you are way out of li--
BENNETT: Enough.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.728
- Quite a testimonial for Section 20.
DALTON: Yes.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.689
Well, don't let them know I said it.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.045
What about you?

42:16.240 --> 42:19.005
DALTON:
Whoever has those triggers...

42:19.680 --> 42:23.162
...I'm fairly sure they won't
be using them as paperweights.

Have you what was promised me?

42:46.240 --> 42:47.890
I was bringing it to you.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.448
Of course.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.689
I have use for them.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.727
...for all your hard work
and dedication during this difficult period.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.805
These are trying times
for a section like ours...

43:47.840 --> 43:50.923

in more operational work...

44:02.160 --> 44:07.644

as of today, that, uh...

That Section 20 requires new leadership...

I'm sorry. Major Dalton.
