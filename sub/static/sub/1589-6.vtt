00:01.160 --> 00:02.092
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.800 --> 00:04.119
Are you okay?

00:04.170 --> 00:05.660
Hey, cowboy,
where have you been?

00:05.700 --> 00:07.099
I think
you've had enough.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.767
Actually, you don't know
what I think.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.438
People are preparing
for Ali's return

00:10.470 --> 00:12.301
and it's not with flowers
and "welcome home" banners.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.399
What are you saying?

00:14.440 --> 00:15.771
I'm saying your friend

00:15.810 --> 00:17.505
hurt a lot of people,
me included.

00:17.550 --> 00:18.801
And I'm notinterested
In continumg that,

00:18.850 --> 00:20.511
_ but I'm also
not gomg to out the people

00:20.550 --> 00:22.108
who feel like they need
to protect themselves.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.242
Maybe she's not coming.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.188
Oh, she's coming.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.381
Ali, do you know
what your first class is?

00:26.420 --> 00:27.512
Mom, what's going on?

00:27.560 --> 00:28.515
I'm leaving your father.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.778
Caleb, when did
you get back?

00:30.830 --> 00:33.025
I don't ever want to hear
you say you're sorry again.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.760
Alison attacked me last night.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.165
You're scared

00:38.200 --> 00:39.360
because you know
it's not gonna take me

00:39.400 --> 00:41.265
long to win
over your army of losers

00:41.300 --> 00:43.029
and you know
I can do it again.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.135
Why wouldn't you just
tell us the truth?

00:49.310 --> 00:50.447
It's not gonna fix this.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.799
I've called this
press conference

00:51.850 --> 00:54.546
because we received
confirmation tonight

00:54.580 --> 00:57.117
that the name of the victim

00:57.150 --> 00:59.789
that was buried alive
under DiLaurentis' property

00:59.820 --> 01:01.549
was Bethany Young.

01:01.590 --> 01:04.787
She was a 17-year-old patient
at the Radley Institution.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.588
( screaming )

01:10.400 --> 01:11.822
It's your house.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.565
Is anyone in there?

01:13.600 --> 01:14.635
Toby!

01:14.670 --> 01:16.365
( cell phones beeping )

01:27.220 --> 01:28.414
It's from "A."

01:28.450 --> 01:29.417
CALEB: What does it say?

01:29.450 --> 01:30.542
"Did you miss me, bitches?"

01:30.590 --> 01:31.841
It can't be.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.209
Shana's dead.

01:34.890 --> 01:35.857
Where's Toby?

01:35.890 --> 01:37.858
I don't know.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.769
( screaming )

01:54.510 --> 01:56.740
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

01:56.780 --> 01:59.419
* Swear this one you'll save

01:59.450 --> 02:01.668
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:01.720 --> 02:04.416
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:04.450 --> 02:06.418
* If I show you
then I know *

02:06.460 --> 02:09.384
* You won't tell what I said

02:09.430 --> 02:11.751
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:11.790 --> 02:14.395
* If one of them is dead

02:17.930 --> 02:18.897
( chattering )

02:18.930 --> 02:22.229
Will you please
call me later?

02:22.270 --> 02:24.135
Okay. Bye.

02:25.670 --> 02:26.671
( sighs )

02:26.710 --> 02:28.405
Well, what did Toby say?

02:28.440 --> 02:29.441
Nobody was inside the house.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.549
Thank God.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.468
Yeah, but his dad did break
his leg trying to avoid

02:32.520 --> 02:33.612
a tree coming down.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.470
It could've been worse.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.545
Yeah. Caleb's with them
at the hospital.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.148
Guys, what does this mean?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.255
That we were wrong
about Shana?

02:42.290 --> 02:44.258
That "A's" alive and knows
that I killed her.

02:45.930 --> 02:46.919
That's impossible.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.655
We all heard what Shana
said in that theater.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.928
No, she never said
that she was "A."

02:49.970 --> 02:50.959
She never used those words.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.298
She had everything
but the letter painted on her.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.329
Em, come on.

02:54.370 --> 02:57.635
We got a text seconds
after the house blew up.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.308
Either Shana_
can cause explosnons

02:59.340 --> 03:00.671
from the grave
or "A" is back.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.200
SPENCER: Or never left.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.444
Well, what are you saying?

03:03.480 --> 03:06.677
I think "A" took a nap
and woke up tonight.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.883
"A's" been here the whole time
Just watching us,

03:09.920 --> 03:11.740
waiting for the right
moment to resurface.

03:11.790 --> 03:12.882
But why now?

03:12.920 --> 03:15.184
That's what
we have to figure out.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.304
Hey.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.669
Hey.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.739
You look like you got
as much sleep as I did.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.678
I was with Toby
until an hour ago.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.358
How is he?

03:47.390 --> 03:49.449
Still pretty shaken.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.754
I still don't get why
"A" would blow up his house

03:51.790 --> 03:53.621
_ when we were
all Just three doors down.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.719
"A" doesn't shoot and miss.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.761
There has to be a reason.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.365
Did you see this?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.702
Wait, that's it?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.879
They're not gonna look
into what caused the leak?

04:09.910 --> 04:11.002
The cops in this town
should be riding

04:11.050 --> 04:13.746
around in clown cars.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.748
I think you guys need
to tell them who's behind this.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.281
Tell them what?

04:17.320 --> 04:18.912
We don't have
a face or a name.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.349
Hanna, this isn't a game.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.880
"A" blew up a house.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.650
We can't.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.055
It would unravel too much.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.751
Meaning?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.963
Things happened
while you were gone.

04:32.470 --> 04:33.960
It's not the same
as when you left.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.298
I've noticed.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.770
Caleb, I had no idea
when you'd come back

04:42.810 --> 04:44.038
or if you'd ever come back.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.742
I won't be staying long.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.042
I'm thinking of going
to Montecito for a while.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.617
I just assumed
if you weren't in Ravenswood

04:53.660 --> 04:54.752
that you'd be here.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.281
I don't want to commit
to anything.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.096
Well, um, it's late.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.893
I should probably
get to school.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.098
Shana wasn't "A."

05:13.140 --> 05:14.835
I killed an innocent person.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.507
Shana wasn't innocent, Aria.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.642
Yeah, but the cops aren't
gonna believe that

05:17.680 --> 05:19.819
when they find out how long
I've been covering this up.

05:19.850 --> 05:20.874
And it's only
a matter of time before "A"

05:20.920 --> 05:22.547
exposes what I did.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.546
We don't know if this person
has any idea about

05:24.590 --> 05:25.841
what happened in New York.

05:28.390 --> 05:30.028
What are you doing?

05:30.060 --> 05:31.755
Looking for a connection.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.451
A connection to what?

05:33.500 --> 05:37.425
Between Mrs. DiLaurentis
and Bethany Young.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.698
Why?

05:38.730 --> 05:39.958
I'm starting to think
I wasn't too far off

05:40.000 --> 05:41.536
about my Mrs. D theory.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.833
Mrs. D was on the board
at Radley Sanitarium.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.508
Bethany was a patient there.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.043
Bethany was buried
in her yard in the same spot

05:50.080 --> 05:51.741
where Ali was buried.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.817
You think that "A" killed
Bethany and Mrs. D?

05:54.850 --> 05:56.010
That would be a connection.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.818
When I was writing my book,

05:58.850 --> 06:00.750
I interviewed
some of the staff at Radley

06:00.790 --> 06:02.826
and I think the name
Bethany Young came up.

06:02.860 --> 06:05.522
I just don't know
which file it's in.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.794
Okay, I can help
you look after school.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.465
Hey, hey.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.963
We're gonna get
through this.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.435
Yeah.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.538
I'll see you later.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.013
Dad.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.187
I didn't see
your car outSIde.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.881
It's in the garage.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.522
Why aren't you at work?

06:38.560 --> 06:40.824
A little hard to concentrate

06:40.860 --> 06:43.124
when your wife and daughter
are living at a hotel.

06:45.830 --> 06:46.797
I have class in 10 minutes.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.091
Spencen

06:50.140 --> 06:51.869
What the hell is going on?

06:53.540 --> 06:54.768
You have to discuss
that with mom.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.107
I would love to,
but she won't return

06:56.140 --> 06:57.141
any of my calls.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.474
We know that you lied about
where you and Melissa

07:01.520 --> 07:03.215
were the night
that Mrs. DiLaurentis died.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.048
How do you know that?

07:06.090 --> 07:07.887
What are you gonna do
when the cops find out

07:07.920 --> 07:10.184
that the pills that killed her
are in your medicine cabinet?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.254
You think I did it?

07:11.290 --> 07:13.155
I know that you were just
trying to protect me.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.054
Damn right, I've been
trying to protect you.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.795
But I would never take
a lIfe to cover up

07:16.830 --> 07:17.797
something you did.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.058
I didn't do anything.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.897
Neither did I.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.502
Then where were you
and Melissa?

07:29.910 --> 07:31.548
Wait, they drove
to the lake to talk?

07:31.580 --> 07:32.808
Yeah, that's what he said.

07:32.850 --> 07:33.817
But he wouldn't say
what they talked about

07:33.850 --> 07:34.817
or why he lied.

07:34.850 --> 07:35.942
Have you talked to Melissa?

07:35.980 --> 07:37.880
Yeah, I've left her
like five messages.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.046
( sighs )

07:40.990 --> 07:43.220
Your mom did the right thing
by leaving.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.955
Yeah.

07:44.990 --> 07:45.979
( cell phone ringing )

07:49.000 --> 07:49.989
It's Ezra.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.968
Hey.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.230
I'm with Spencer.

07:56.270 --> 07:57.965
Okay.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.875
Yeah. Well,
thanks for checking in.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.138
I'll see you later.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.542
He's trying to find a link
between Bethany and Mrs. D.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.172
Has he found one yet?
No.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.188
He's left messages for
all his contacts at Radley,

08:10.220 --> 08:12.984
but so far nothing.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.123
And you're going over
to Ezra's place later?

08:18.290 --> 08:19.621
Yeah.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.594
I'm gonna help him
sort through his files.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.588
Is that the only reason?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.997
Is there something going on
between you two?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.959
No.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.978
Then why did you bring him
to Emily's last night?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.607
Okay, we had a slip.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.003
A slip?

08:38.050 --> 08:41.872
Well, technically,
it was two slips.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.888
Oh, my God!
Aria!

08:43.920 --> 08:45.285
I thought you said that you were
never gonna go there again.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.878
I meant it when I said it.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.888
Are you forgetting about
what he did to you?

08:48.920 --> 08:50.023
What he did to us?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.152
No, of course not.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.953
You couldn't eat
or sleep for weeks

08:53.000 --> 08:54.194
after you found out
about that book.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.095
Okay, well he took
a bullet for us, Spence.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.097
Yeah, but that
doesn't change the fact

08:57.130 --> 08:59.667
that he deceived you for years.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.089
Hey.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.062
You okay?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.566
Somebody dropped
their lunch tray

09:05.610 --> 09:07.635
and she practically
jumped out of her skin.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.307
So much for the new normal.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.898
Yeah, I knew it was
too good to be true.

09:10.950 --> 09:11.974
Too good to be true?

09:12.010 --> 09:15.070
These last two weeks
have been nothing but crap.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.178
Is Toby still
at the hospital?

09:16.220 --> 09:17.187
Uh, yeah.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.209
( cell phone ringing )

09:18.250 --> 09:19.285
He's there
with Jenna and her mom.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.015
What's up with Caleb?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.618
How long
is he in town for?

09:22.660 --> 09:23.649
Who knows?

09:23.690 --> 09:24.679
Oh, my God.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.027
What is it?

09:30.300 --> 09:31.995
Oh, my God. Ali.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.629
"I buried your mom
the same way

09:39.680 --> 09:41.978
I watched her bury you.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.215
"A" killed my mother.

09:55.660 --> 09:58.083
Who could it be? Mona?

09:58.130 --> 10:00.098
Someone working with Shana?

10:00.130 --> 10:02.121
Yeah, or someone
we haven't even thought of yet.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.992
Spence, are you okay?

10:09.170 --> 10:10.364
My dad didn't do it.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.608
I accused him of murder,
but he didn't do it.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.944
Well, it made sense
why you thought he did.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.278
Unless your dad's "A."

10:23.720 --> 10:25.881
I'm sorry, I'm just
putting it out there.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.955
No, he can't be.

10:26.990 --> 10:31.359
And he thought that I killed
Alison, now Bethany.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.028
That still doesn't
rule out your Sister.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.221
Some things never change

10:35.260 --> 10:36.966
and now we're back
to square one.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.264
No, Ezra thinks that Bethany
can ultimately lead us to "A."

10:39.300 --> 10:41.393
Okay, then we have to try
to help Ezra find out

10:41.440 --> 10:43.431
as much as we can about her.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.131
Aren't we stretching
a little here?

10:45.170 --> 10:46.364
You have a better plan?

10:46.410 --> 10:48.708
I can't wait
around for answers.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.276
I need to leave town now.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.005
But you just got back here.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.278
The only reason
I came back is

10:53.320 --> 10:55.072
because I thought
that "A" was dead.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.088
If "A" wanted to kill you,
why not just do it?

10:57.120 --> 11:00.089
Why play games
and blow up a house?

11:00.120 --> 11:01.451
I have no idea.

11:01.490 --> 11:04.084
But I'm not sticking
around to find out.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.054
But if you leave Rosewood,
then we can't protect you.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.159
Yeah, and besides,
it's not like before, Ali.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.020
The cops are watching
your every move.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.025
The whole world knows
you're alive.

11:12.070 --> 11:15.995
Even if you could run,
where would you hide?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.417
This is absolutely
ridiculous.

11:29.450 --> 11:32.180
I am so disappointed
in your lack of cooperation,

11:32.220 --> 11:34.916
but when you change
your mind, there's my number.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.018
Think. Give me a call.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.220
Okay? We're out of here.
Let's go.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.991
( sighs )

11:48.500 --> 11:49.467
Spencen

11:49.500 --> 11:51.058
Eddie. Hi.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.204
Thank you for coming out.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.468
I hope that I wasn't
interrupting anything.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.068
I have a few minutes.

11:57.110 --> 11:58.338
Great.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.314
You look good.
How are you doing?

12:00.350 --> 12:01.169
Well...

12:02.850 --> 12:04.283
well enough
to stay out of this place.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.756
Did you hear about
the Cavanaugh settlement?

12:07.790 --> 12:10.224
I'm glad the family
got some money.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.319
They would've
preferred the truth.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.222
Heard abo_ut
Mrs. DiLaurentis, too.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.488
Yeah.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.418
I don't really think
that it was a coincidence

12:19.470 --> 12:22.359
that Bethany Young was
found buried in her baclqard.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.504
Do you?

12:24.540 --> 12:26.235
Probably not.

12:26.270 --> 12:28.431
Did you know Bethany well?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.199
IfI did, I can't
talk about it.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.242
Right. Okay.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.544
Do you maybe
want to go get coffee later?

12:36.580 --> 12:39.413
I can't talk about Bethany
or any other patient

12:39.450 --> 12:44.149
not to the cops
or reporters or you.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.222
Look, I know
that you have a set of rules

12:48.260 --> 12:51.024
that you have to stick
to and I understand that,

12:51.070 --> 12:53.095
but somebody
very close to me

12:53.140 --> 12:54.539
might be framed for her murder.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.505
So if you could just tell me
anything at all,

12:57.540 --> 13:00.509
like if anybody from Rosewood
ever visited her or anything,

13:00.540 --> 13:02.201
it would be such a great help.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.548
I wish I could.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.172
MAN: Eddie, you got
a phone call.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.147
Good seeing you, Spencer.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.441
Yeah.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.061
I should never have
come back here.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.294
Look, I get
that you're scared, Ali.

13:24.330 --> 13:25.399
We all do.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.829
That's why
you're staying with me.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.167
You can't just
babysit me forever, Hanna.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.292
( doorbell ringing )

13:29.340 --> 13:31.604
Wait. Don't just open it.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.401
It's just Travis.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.069
I'll be in the kitchen.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.249
Hey you.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.013
This is a nice surprise.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.084
Is it?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.350
Because we had plans to go
to the Grille at 7:00.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.418
I know you weren't drunk
when we made them.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.426
Look, I'm sorry.

13:59.470 --> 14:02.268
With everything going on
I totally spaced.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.238
Travis, I would go,
but A" is in there

14:06.270 --> 14:08.431
and I really don't want
to leave her alone right now.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.368
She's going through
a tough time.

14:10.410 --> 14:11.377
I saw Mona's video.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.549
Looked like Ali was
the one making it tough.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.275
Don't believe
everything that you see.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.242
And about Lucas' party,

14:17.290 --> 14:19.850
I hope that I didn't do
anything too embarrassing.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.356
Just on your phone all night
trying to call someone.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.358
I was?

14:25.390 --> 14:27.255
I don't remember that.

14:29.260 --> 14:30.625
But I don't really
remember anything

14:30.670 --> 14:32.399
after the_room
started spinning.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.303
Figured there was somewhere else
you wanted to be.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.638
Yeah, in bed
with an ice-pack.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.140
So we're okay?

14:43.180 --> 14:45.273
Yeah. Great.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.515
I'll call you
when Ali leaves.

14:51.550 --> 14:54.553
Okay.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.410
Later.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.499
Ali?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.132
I don't know.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.274
Just get there, okay?

15:16.310 --> 15:18.278
Yeah, okay.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.574
Yeah. See you then.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.315
Who are you
on the phone with?

15:22.350 --> 15:24.443
Doesn't matter.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.287
Well, it sounded like
you are making plans

15:26.320 --> 15:27.412
to go somewhere.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.679
Were you?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.129
Alison.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.127
I can't live in a world

15:33.160 --> 15:35.355
where I jump every time
the doorbell rings.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.288
_ So what?
You're just gonna run away?

15:37.330 --> 15:41.437
Please don't tell the girls
or try to stop me.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.438
What are you gonna do?

15:43.470 --> 15:45.301
Say that you were
kidnapped again?

15:45.340 --> 15:46.637
Do you think
I want to live like this?

15:48.210 --> 15:49.336
Because I don't.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.575
I'd love to stay, Hanna,
but I can't.

15:51.610 --> 15:54.215
Not while that psychopath
is still out there.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.289
And don't worry,
after I'm gone,

15:57.320 --> 16:00.448
you can go back to focusing
on your little love triangle.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.257
Ali, wait.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.422
I've made my decision, Hanna.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.459
So have I.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.361
I'm gonna help you.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.206
Nothing in this pile either.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.707
Okay.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.245
That was a fun day.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.487
Look, Ezra,
what happened the other night--

16:32.520 --> 16:34.681
Felt right, didn't it?

16:34.720 --> 16:37.154
It doesn't mean that things
can go back to the way

16:37.190 --> 16:38.259
that they were.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.223
So what does it mean?

16:42.260 --> 16:44.626
Oh, I'm not gonna pretend
like I don't miss it,

16:44.670 --> 16:48.162
us, because I do.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.235
I do, too.

16:49.270 --> 16:53.673
Yeah, but then I remember
everything that happened

16:53.710 --> 16:56.338
and how we met,
all the lies that you told.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.371
Believe me, I wish I could
go back and change things.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.445
But you can't.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.582
And the other night
was a mistake.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.513
( knocking on door)

17:16.460 --> 17:17.529
Evening, Mr. Fitz.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.266
I'm Lieutenant Tanner,
State Police.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.562
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.465
Sure, yeah.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.365
Oh, this was outside
your door.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.377
Great.
Thank you so much.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.239
Mind ifI come in?

17:35.450 --> 17:38.339
Sure. Of course.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.584
Come in.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.495
( clears throat )

17:55.240 --> 17:56.491
Moving out?

17:56.540 --> 17:57.859
Oh, no.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.572
Just getting rid of
some old school files.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.635
So what can
I help you with, Lieutenant?

18:02.680 --> 18:06.377
Just some questions
about Shana Fring.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.514
Oh, I thought
the New York detectives

18:08.550 --> 18:09.574
were handling that case.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.587
They are.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.384
But Shana was a former
resident of Rosewood,

18:13.420 --> 18:16.253
so we're just helping them
gather further information.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.724
Yeah, I see, I see.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.398
Did you know Shana well?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.819
Uh, no.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.725
She was never actually
a student of mine.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.624
Hmm. Did you ever mention to her

18:26.670 --> 18:28.365
that your mother
owned a theater in New York?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.800
No, I never mentioned
that to any of my students.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.603
Oh, so it's just
a coincidence

18:32.640 --> 18:33.629
that her body
was found there?

18:34.610 --> 18:37.545
It came as quite a shock
to me and my family.

18:38.780 --> 18:42.739
You were shot the night before
Shana was killed.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.338
That's right.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.415
When we found Shana,

18:46.450 --> 18:49.783
she had some gun residue
on her sweatshirt.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.857
Oh.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.458
Sorry, what was the question?

18:56.500 --> 18:59.765
Oh, um, do you remember
anything about your mugger,

18:59.800 --> 19:02.667
something that would help
the investigation?

19:02.700 --> 19:04.839
Nothing that I haven't
already said.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.837
Well, that's all for now.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.507
Thank you for your time.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.506
Yes, of course.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.576
Well, let me know if I can be
of any further help,

19:15.620 --> 19:16.814
Lieutenant.

19:16.850 --> 19:19.318
I certainly will.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.473
You need to give me
those names, Paige.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.408
The ones conspiring
with Mona.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.678
I can't tell you,

19:51.720 --> 19:54.553
especially after the way
Alison treated her.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.319
Mona altered
that video, Paige.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.555
Even if she did, Mona didn't
make her say those things.

19:58.590 --> 20:01.696
Alison isn't sorry about the way
she treated anybody.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.425
She'_s still_the same
manipulative person

20:03.470 --> 20:04.459
she always was.

20:09.470 --> 20:10.607
Whoever blew up
the Cavanaugh house

20:10.640 --> 20:12.562
is now threatening her.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.305
I thought it was a gas leak.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.500
Someone caused that leak.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.569
And you think it's Mona?

20:17.610 --> 20:19.578
It's possible.

20:19.610 --> 20:20.747
With a little help
from her friends.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.684
Why would Mona want to blow up
the Cavanaugh house?

20:24.720 --> 20:25.584
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.581
Look, I know how you feel
about Alison.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.621
But could you live with yourself
if something happened to her,

20:33.660 --> 20:35.753
knowing that you could've done
something to stop it?

20:40.370 --> 20:41.268
All your father did was

20:41.300 --> 20:43.609
substitute one ridiculous lie
for another.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.607
Well, maybe you'd
change your mind

20:44.640 --> 20:45.504
if you just talk to him.

20:45.540 --> 20:47.576
I don't even_ want to look at him
right now.

20:47.610 --> 20:48.702
Well, you're going
to have to.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.641
He at least deserves to know
that you're gonna leave him.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.575
Unless you expect me to deliver
that news as well.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.412
( door opens )

21:02.720 --> 21:03.687
Oh, great.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.719
Your father's here.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.459
I asked him to come.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.702
Yeah, I got it.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.503
Okay.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.642
Thanks.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.808
Um, Noel's gonna pick me up
from Princeton Station at 10:00.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.647
You're taking the train?

21:31.690 --> 21:32.714
Not from here.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.355
I need you to take me
to Newtown Station at 8:00.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.755
No. No.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.621
I'll drive you to Princeton.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.696
Look, I want to make sure
that you get there safely.

21:40.730 --> 21:43.824
And my mom's out with Ted,
so we can use her car.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.832
Hanna, you don't have
to give me so much.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.529
Ali, you can't just walk out
of your house

21:55.580 --> 21:56.535
with a bag of clothes.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.774
You're right.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.574
But I want to see
my dad...

22:02.750 --> 22:03.717
before I leave.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.889
And I need to get a few things
from my house.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.808
Well, I'll drop you off now

22:07.860 --> 22:09.816
and then I'll go
get cash for you

22:09.860 --> 22:12.886
and just call me
whenever you're ready to leave.

22:16.730 --> 22:17.890
Thank you.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.862
You're really saving me,
Hanna.

22:29.710 --> 22:30.779
Come on.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.568
Okay, we need to get these boxes
out of here right now.

22:59.610 --> 23:01.430
Okay, let's just slow down
a second here.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.869
Tanner's probably on her way
back here with a search warrant.

23:03.910 --> 23:04.877
She's not on her way
back here.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.639
How can you say that?

23:06.680 --> 23:07.647
I mean she basically said

23:07.680 --> 23:09.648
she knows that Shana was the one
that shot you.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.648
Well, then why would she want
to search my place?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.555
'Cause she knows that you're
hiding something, that's why.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.750
Well, she's gonna need
a whole lot

23:14.790 --> 23:16.758
more than suspicion
to get a search warrant.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.485
If she does come back,
she's gonna find proof

23:18.530 --> 23:19.827
that you were lying about
how well you knew Shana

23:19.860 --> 23:21.828
and that Ali
wasn't kidnapped.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.920
I guess I could move this stuff
into my storage unit.

23:26.830 --> 23:27.990
Wait, no.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.769
No, because if it's registered
in your name

23:29.800 --> 23:31.904
they're just gonna
search that, too.

23:31.940 --> 23:35.899
Hmm, okay, let's just put
everything in my attic

23:35.940 --> 23:37.168
until we find
a better place.

23:37.210 --> 23:38.768
My dad's in Syracuse
unﬁlSunday.

23:38.810 --> 23:39.799
Okay.
That's a good idea.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.909
Oh, what is this?

23:50.830 --> 23:51.819
Oh, my God,

23:51.860 --> 23:53.725
I think that's supposed to be
Mrs. DiLaurentis.

23:54.930 --> 23:56.420
How can you tell?

23:57.670 --> 23:59.763
I mean that's her house.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.495
She was obsessed
with her roses.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.629
And she definitely wore scarves
like that.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.433
Bethany.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.947
How many Bethanys do you know?
Just one.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.016
And she was buried
in Mrs. DiLaurentis' baclqard.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.541
Ezra, who would want you
to have this?

24:16.580 --> 24:17.615
Why?

24:18.720 --> 24:19.846
My money's on "A".

24:21.620 --> 24:23.759
I still have my security cameras
up in the hallway.

24:32.030 --> 24:34.590
Hey, didn't you hear me
knocking?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.596
No. Sorry.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.767
Paige named names.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.971
Lucas _and Melissa
are working With Mona.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.568
And they're all
after Alison.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.248
Melissa?

24:44.280 --> 24:45.941
Oh, my God.
Have you told Spencer?

24:45.980 --> 24:46.947
No, not yet.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.242
Where is Ali?

24:48.280 --> 24:50.987
Um, she went home
to have dinner with her dad.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.840
I'll go tell her.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.858
No!

24:54.890 --> 24:56.858
Why don't you wait
till the morning to do that?

24:57.890 --> 24:59.585
This is too important
to wait.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.035
8 o'clock train?

25:11.070 --> 25:12.606
Yeah.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.801
I was thinking
of visiting my grandma.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.876
Wrong direction, Hanna.

25:17.910 --> 25:19.946
New Jersey isn't on the way
to Oklahoma.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.027
Ali's leaving.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.049
No.
She's not.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.994
She was going to
but I stopped her.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.092
I don't believe you.

25:38.870 --> 25:39.928
Emily, wait.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.069
Okay, fine.
You're right.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.831
How could you let her go
without telling us?

25:46.870 --> 25:48.030
It's not safe for her here.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.878
Like she'll be safer
out there all alone.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.605
It's what she wants.

25:52.650 --> 25:53.912
Are you sure
that's the only reason

25:53.950 --> 25:54.917
why you're helping her?

25:54.950 --> 25:56.941
What is that
supposed to mean?

25:58.690 --> 26:00.783
Your hair. Your clothes.

26:00.820 --> 26:01.957
You know,
a lot's changed with you

26:01.990 --> 26:02.888
since she's been back.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.855
Oh, yeah.
And nothing's changed with you?

26:05.890 --> 26:08.051
I saw you holding her hand
last night.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.624
She was frightened.

26:09.660 --> 26:10.922
She reached for me.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.722
What was I supposed to do,
slap her hand?

26:15.970 --> 26:17.858
Don't you dare follow me.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.748
WOMAN: Let's go, ladies.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.577
Practice starts
in one minute.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.047
Dad?

27:04.090 --> 27:05.648
Hey, where are you?

27:07.090 --> 27:08.819
No, I didn't get
your message.

27:10.090 --> 27:11.125
That's okay.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.893
Yeah, don't worry.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.625
Um, I'll just sleep over
at Hanna's tonight.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.658
I love you, too.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.205
Bye, dad.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.265
Dad?

29:47.210 --> 29:48.916
No!

30:29.060 --> 30:30.049
Oh, my God.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.079
Ali.

30:44.370 --> 30:44.699
( Ali coughs )

30:45.940 --> 30:46.964
We're calling the police.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.204
No.
You can't do that.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.208
And you can't call
my dad either.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.208
Ali, someone broke
into your house

30:52.250 --> 30:53.478
and attacked you.

30:53.510 --> 30:54.909
Exactly.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.269
Okay, if anyone knows
that this happened,

30:56.320 --> 30:58.311
I'm never gonna be able
to leave here.

30:58.350 --> 31:00.545
Look, if you don't want
anyone to know then fine.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.251
Okay, but you're not
going anywhere.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.848
At least, not tonight.

31:06.660 --> 31:07.854
( knocking on door)

31:10.260 --> 31:11.898
Mind ifI come in?

31:13.200 --> 31:14.394
Sure.

31:20.210 --> 31:22.007
Toby told me that
I'd find you here.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.371
What's up?

31:23.410 --> 31:24.638
I don't know.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.545
Just wanted to see you.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.112
Something happen?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.549
Ali was gonna
leave town tonight

31:38.590 --> 31:41.150
for good
and I was helping her.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.019
Look, whoever killed Ali's mom
is still out there.

31:47.170 --> 31:48.990
I understand
her wanting to go.

31:51.470 --> 31:54.906
I realized I wasn't helping her
to keep her safe.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.648
Part of me
wanted her gone.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.806
It makes sense.

31:59.850 --> 32:03.013
You never liked who you were
when you were around her.

32:03.050 --> 32:04.210
I still do...

32:07.090 --> 32:08.352
want her gone.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.556
Hanna, whatever she stirred up
inside of you

32:13.590 --> 32:17.151
is not gonna go away
even, if she leaves.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.189
I should know.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.098
I left Ravenswood

32:21.140 --> 32:23.233
and what happened there
is still with me.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.204
What did happen?

32:25.240 --> 32:27.561
And I know it's not
just about

32:27.610 --> 32:28.929
you not knowing
where Miranda is.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.347
Well, I hope you decide
to stay.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.199
You see anything yet?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.265
Just you,
arriving at my door.

33:01.710 --> 33:04.508
I can't believe you still have
a camera in your hallway.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.178
Makes sense with all
the research material here.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.018
So whoever dropped off
that picture

33:11.050 --> 33:12.210
had to have done it
after I arrived

33:12.250 --> 33:13.217
but before Tanner came.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.410
Yeah.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.513
Okay, now we wait.

33:20.430 --> 33:21.658
You know,
I've been thinking...

33:23.260 --> 33:26.627
maybe you should tell Tanner
the truth about Shana.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.366
You know, that she was
the one that shot you.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.537
Where's this coming from?

33:31.540 --> 33:32.700
Ezra, you lied
to the police.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.674
You could get
into serious trouble.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.132
But if I tell
the truth now,

33:36.180 --> 33:37.670
they're gonna know
I've been covering something up.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.472
Oh, God, I hate that
I dragged you into this mess.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.646
Hey, hey.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.772
You didn't.

33:43.820 --> 33:46.539
I dragged myself into it
when I decided to write a book.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.227
Oh.
Did you see that?

33:53.260 --> 33:54.249
No. Go back.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.297
Do you know who that is?

34:00.330 --> 34:01.592
Yeah, it's Eddie Lamb.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.096
He works at Radley
and he's one of the people

34:04.670 --> 34:06.399
Eddie Lamb?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.408
That's who Spencer
talked to today.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.532
She said
he wouldn't tell her a thing,

34:09.580 --> 34:11.275
that it was against
Radley policy.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.175
I guess he's had
a change of heart.

34:13.210 --> 34:15.713
Okay, but why leave it for you
and not Spencer?

34:19.450 --> 34:20.519
It wasn't "A".

34:20.550 --> 34:23.417
Whoever it was could've
killed me and chose not to.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.087
Who would want to scare you
like that?

34:26.630 --> 34:28.552
Lucas.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.158
Your_sister.
Melissa?

34:30.200 --> 34:31.599
She's part of Mona's gang.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.769
Look, we don't know who it is.
Okay?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.267
It was too dark
to see anything.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.664
Oh, my God.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.732
How could this happen?

34:40.770 --> 34:42.306
It happened
because she was alone.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.477
Hanna wasn't with her.

34:43.510 --> 34:44.875
- Where is Hanna?
- I didn't call her.

34:44.910 --> 34:47.572
She was gonna help Ali
leave town tonight.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.214
What?
What?

34:49.250 --> 34:50.239
Don't be pissed at her.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.589
What happened is just more proof
that I should go.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.713
_ W_e're no closer _
to figuring out who "A" is.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.182
That might not be true.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.625
Eddie Lamb gave this
to Ezra.

35:00.660 --> 35:01.695
Eddie?
Wait, from Radley?

35:01.730 --> 35:02.719
Yeah.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.862
What's it supposed to be?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.197
It's a drawing of my mother.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.138
We think that Bethany drew that
while she was in there.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.706
So they did know
each other.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.174
Doesn't look like Bethany
liked your mom too much.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.207
Really?
What gave it away?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.344
Was it the demon
or the spear?

35:19.380 --> 35:20.642
What did Eddie say?
He didn't.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.342
He left it anonymously.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.211
Ezra_sti|l_ has a camera
in his hallway

35:25.250 --> 35:26.342
and we saw it
on the Video.

35:26.390 --> 35:27.482
I don't get it.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.351
Why would Eddie leave that
for Ezra?

35:29.390 --> 35:30.357
Eddie wants Ezra to know

35:30.390 --> 35:31.857
that there's something
to look into at Radley.

35:33.930 --> 35:35.420
One of us
has to get in there.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.449
I vote Spencer.

35:37.530 --> 35:38.519
What?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.162
You know
the place the best.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.269
I can't go back in there.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.528
I was committed.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.834
And her dad helped Toby's family
win a settlement against Radley.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.399
I think I have a way in.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.168
"See how easy it is for me
to kill you?

35:57.450 --> 36:01.580
If you leave Rosewood,
I will. A."

36:01.620 --> 36:02.814
I don't get it.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.725
For 2 years,
"A's" been hunting you down

36:04.760 --> 36:05.852
like a warrior cat
and now--

36:05.890 --> 36:07.858
"A" wants you alive
and in town.

36:07.890 --> 36:08.857
But why?

36:19.610 --> 36:20.508
I never thanked you
for what you did tonight.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.342
I didn't do anything.

36:25.380 --> 36:26.847
You risked your life
for me, Em.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.339
Most people see danger

36:29.380 --> 36:30.813
and they run
in the opposite direction

36:30.850 --> 36:32.215
as fast as they can.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.611
It's getting late.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.480
Do you want me
to take you home?

36:42.660 --> 36:44.366
I don't want
to be alone tonight.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.463
Can I stay here?

36:50.400 --> 36:51.833
We'll just sleep.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.565
I promise.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.828
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.642
Hi.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.681
Hey,
I got you banana nut.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.918
Thank you.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.482
Is Toby coming?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.485
No.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.623
He wanted me to stop along
over at the house

37:49.660 --> 37:51.491
to see if anything
survived the fire.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.623
Ah, that poor family.

37:53.670 --> 37:54.762
If there's something
I can do for them,

37:54.800 --> 37:55.892
please let me know.

37:55.940 --> 37:56.895
Yeah.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.259
( cell phone ringing )

38:00.370 --> 38:01.598
Hi.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.603
I'm with Spencer
at the Brew.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.775
I'll be there around noon.

38:08.820 --> 38:09.570
I still have to get
our stuff

38:09.620 --> 38:11.019
and check
out of the hotel first.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.510
Okay.
Bye.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.686
Is that dad?

38:17.720 --> 38:18.880
It was.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.079
Are we moving back home?

38:21.130 --> 38:22.324
Yes.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.526
But your father's
moving out.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.565
We decided it was
the best thing for everyone.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.367
You both decided this?

38:35.940 --> 38:36.907
I don't understand though.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.874
I thought you said
that everything went well,

38:38.910 --> 38:40.844
that you believed him
that he was telling the truth.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.575
I do.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.541
So?

38:43.580 --> 38:45.889
Honey, leaving your dad
isn't about one lie.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.581
It's about years of them.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.823
I thought you guys
were happy.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.555
We were.

38:53.590 --> 38:54.818
Some of the time.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.350
Mom, can't you please,

38:56.400 --> 38:58.425
please just give him
one more chance?

38:58.470 --> 38:59.596
No, honey.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.635
I already have.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.330
Too many.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.430
( indistinct chatter )

39:20.620 --> 39:21.609
Hey.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.656
Hi.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.885
What are you doing
for lunch later?

39:25.930 --> 39:27.886
Do you want
to eat with me?

39:27.930 --> 39:28.897
My treat.

39:28.930 --> 39:29.954
I can't.
I got things to do.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.839
Look, I'm sorry for not calling
you back last night.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.633
There was just--
there's been a lot--

39:36.670 --> 39:37.659
Going on.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.134
Right?

39:40.170 --> 39:42.138
Yeah.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.533
I mean, with All back--

39:43.580 --> 39:44.877
Caleb.

39:44.910 --> 39:47.003
When I saw him
this morning at the Grille

39:47.050 --> 39:49.041
I figured that's why
you've been so distracted.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.154
Well, I'll give you
one less thing to worry about.

39:55.190 --> 39:56.748
Travis, wait.

39:56.790 --> 39:59.782
I can't keep doing this
if you're only in it halfway.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.994
I like you too much
for that.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.679
You have
a great school record

40:15.710 --> 40:17.928
and we are looking
for volunteers.

40:17.980 --> 40:21.074
But you need to know that
our patients can be challenging,

40:21.110 --> 40:23.510
even aggressive at times.

40:23.550 --> 40:24.778
Are you sure
you'd be comfortable

40:24.820 --> 40:26.082
working in this environment?

40:27.250 --> 40:28.456
I'm comfortable.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.826
Thank you
for stopping here.

40:45.740 --> 40:46.809
What's she doing here?

40:46.840 --> 40:48.102
I don't know.

40:51.850 --> 40:52.805
Hi.

40:52.850 --> 40:53.942
Good morning, girls.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.516
Is your dad home?

40:55.550 --> 40:56.642
You just missed him.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.489
He left for work
a minute ago.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.384
Oh.

40:59.420 --> 41:01.149
Is there anything
I can help you with?

41:01.190 --> 41:02.817
Well, actually there is.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.158
I would like it if you would
come down to the station later

41:05.190 --> 41:07.556
with your dad
and answer some questions.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.228
About what?

41:09.260 --> 41:12.525
Your childhood friend,
Shana Fring.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.696
I still can't believe
she's gone.

41:17.740 --> 41:20.231
Yeah.
It's so sad.

41:20.270 --> 41:23.671
So much tragedy
for such a small town.

41:23.710 --> 41:25.200
If there's anything
I can help you with.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.946
Well, we were hoping
that you could tell us

41:27.980 --> 41:29.709
where you were
the night she died.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.149
I already did.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.717
I was in Philly
with the girls.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.617
Specifically where
in Philly...

41:39.630 --> 41:41.996
you know,
that kind of thing.

41:45.070 --> 41:49.131
Well, you tell your dad
to give me a call.

41:57.010 --> 41:58.705
( cell phone ringing )

42:06.950 --> 42:09.214
"Time for the caged bird
to sing.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.216
_A.ll
