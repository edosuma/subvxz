WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:08.142
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.242 --> 00:11.212
I'LL PUT YOURS
IN THE DRYER

00:11.312 --> 00:13.214
AND THEY'LL BE
READY BY THE END
OF THE SESSION.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.116
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO HELP ME.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.685
I HAVEN'T GOT
DRESSED ON MY OWN
SINCE MY ACCIDENT.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.721
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU
MANAGE WITH TWO
BROKEN ARMS?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.323
I DON'T.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.325
SHE'S COOL.
YOU COULD LEARN
A LOT FROM YOUR WIFE

00:24.425 --> 00:26.327
ABOUT HOW
TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.562
ARE THERE PEOPLE
WHO SAY THINGS ABOUT
YOU, SOPHIE?

00:28.662 --> 00:32.666
SOME OF THE GIRLS
AT THE GYM MIGHT BE
JEALOUS OF YOU

00:32.766 --> 00:35.836
AND HOW CLOSE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS
WITH CY?

00:35.936 --> 00:37.471
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M A CHILD.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.707
HOW DO YOU GET
ALONG WITH CY'S WIFE?

00:39.807 --> 00:41.375
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT THEM.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.478
"DURING FIRST
SESSION APPEARS
TO BE VERY IMPRESSIVE,

00:44.578 --> 00:47.515
SENSITIVE,
MATURE FOR HER AGE,

00:47.615 --> 00:49.417
VERY INTELLIGENT

00:49.517 --> 00:51.985
AND A HIGHLY-INDEPENDENT
PERSONALITY."

00:52.086 --> 00:53.954
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THOSE THINGS YOU WROTE?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.756
ABSOLUTELY.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.461
( knocking )

01:07.501 --> 01:11.472
IT ISN'T SERIOUS.
IT COMES OFF IN A WEEK.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.289
MY COUSIN STAYED OVER
LAST NIGHT.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.191
SHE'S HERE
VISITING COLLEGES

01:30.291 --> 01:32.293
SO SHE GOT TO SLEEP
IN MY ROOM

01:32.393 --> 01:34.862
AND I HAD
TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

01:34.962 --> 01:39.367
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
I COULDN'T MOVE MY NECK.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.535
I HAD TO GO
TO THE DOCTOR'S
TODAY ANYWAY

01:41.635 --> 01:44.205
TO GET MY CASTS OFF,
BUT HE TOOK ONE
LOOK AT ME

01:44.305 --> 01:46.940
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"I DON'T THINK SO."

01:47.040 --> 01:49.410
HE PUT THIS
THING ON ME.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.313
HE LEFT MY CASTS
ON TOO BECAUSE--

01:52.413 --> 01:54.915
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
ACTUALLY.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.386
I GUESS TAKING THEM OFF
MIGHT CAUSE TOO MUCH
STRAIN ON MY NECK.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.823
( theme music playing )

02:19.173 --> 02:21.242
I FOUND SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.612
I THOUGHT YOU
SHOULD HAVE IT.

02:24.712 --> 02:28.148
- IN HERE?
- YEAH, IN THE FRONT POCKET.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.822
IT'S FOR
YOUR COLLECTION.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.326
IT'S A CATBOAT.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.028
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.764
IT'S A GOING-AWAY
PRESENT.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.200
THIS IS OUR
LAST SESSION, RIGHT?
YOU SAID THREE.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.937
NO, I SAID
AT LEAST THREE.

02:54.107 --> 02:57.511
IF YOU'RE TOTALLY
SICK OF LISTENING TO OTHER
PEOPLE'S INSIPID LIVES,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.880
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN
LOOK AT IT

02:59.980 --> 03:03.150
AND IT WILL MAKE
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.186
"INSIPID"--
THAT'S A GOOD WORD.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.323
I READ THESAURUSES
FOR FUN.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.526
I'M NOT A FREAK, OKAY?
I JUST LIKE WORDS.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.397
I THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE IT.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.532
IT MUST REALLY SUCK
HAVING TO LISTEN

03:18.632 --> 03:21.034
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS ALL DAY.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.736
MMM.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.209
SO DOES THAT CHAIR, LIKE,
ENHANCE YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.144
( laughs )
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.080
CAN YOU READ MINDS?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.283
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.951
YEAH, IT WOULD
BE A LOT EASIER
IF YOU COULD.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.787
IT WOULD.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.291
CAN I TRY THE CHAIR?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.327
SURE.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.036
PLEASE.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.740
( chuckles )
THANK YOU.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.916
HOW ARE YOU?
YOU LOOK TIRED.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.984
I'M OKAY.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.954
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE A NAP.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.757
MAYBE.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.994
I'VE NOTICED THAT, UH,
CY'S DRAWING IS--

04:21.094 --> 04:22.896
IS GONE.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.632
- DID YOU ERASE IT?
- YES.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.600
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.804
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.307
MAYBE A LITTLE SCARED

04:33.407 --> 04:36.977
BECAUSE THIS COULD BE
OUR FINAL SESSION?

04:38.412 --> 04:41.449
WHY WOULD I BE SCARED?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.584
IS THE EVALUATION
GOING TO BE BAD?

04:43.684 --> 04:46.387
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE EVALUATION
THAT SCARES YOU.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.456
I THINK IT'S
THE POSSIBILITY

04:48.556 --> 04:52.025
THAT YOU WON'T BE
COMING BACK.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.728
SORRY, BUT NO.

04:54.828 --> 04:58.366
I BOUGHT YOU
A GOODBYE PRESENT.
SEE YA.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.535
I KNOW IT'S
A GOODBYE PRESENT,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.904
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

05:04.004 --> 05:08.509
MAYBE YOU WANT TO LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND

05:08.609 --> 05:10.344
SO THAT I WON'T
FORGET YOU.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.880
- YOU SAID YOU
LIKED THE BOAT.
- I DO.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.915
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT,
I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.818
DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE IT BACK?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.530
SO...

05:29.630 --> 05:32.032
IF SOMEONE MY AGE
WANTS TO START THERAPY,

05:32.132 --> 05:33.601
HOW WOULD IT WORK?

05:33.701 --> 05:37.805
WELL, WE'D TAKE IT
AT THAT PERSON'S OWN PACE,

05:37.905 --> 05:40.908
NOT LIKE THESE
LAST FEW SESSIONS--

05:41.008 --> 05:43.711
THE EVALUATION,
THE THREE-SESSION DEADLINE--
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

05:43.811 --> 05:48.382
SEE, THE PERSON WHO'S
IN THERAPY CONTROLS THE GAS,

05:48.482 --> 05:50.317
SO TO SPEAK,

05:50.418 --> 05:52.520
AND THE WHEEL
FOR THAT MATTER.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.659
SO IT'S LIKE
DRIVING A CAR?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.962
YEAH, IT'S A BIT
LIKE DRIVING A CAR.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.007
SO...

06:15.443 --> 06:17.277
PRETEND I'M
IN THERAPY NOW.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.312
ALL RIGHT.
AHEM.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.950
I SAID PRETEND.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.719
SO WHAT DO I DO?

06:25.819 --> 06:29.389
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THE BOAT?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.693
I GOT IT YEARS AGO
FROM A HOMELESS WOMAN

06:32.793 --> 06:35.429
IN NEW YORK
WHEN I WAS JUST A KID.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.764
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN NEW YORK?

06:36.864 --> 06:39.399
WE WERE
ON A "FAMILY" VACATION.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.035
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
"FAMILY" VACATION?

06:42.135 --> 06:45.138
BECAUSE IT WASN'T A REAL
VACATION AND WE WEREN'T
A REAL FAMILY.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.808
NO SAND, NO OCEAN--

06:47.908 --> 06:51.512
THAT'S NOT
A VACATION, YOU KNOW.
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.081
MY DAD TOOK ME
TO CENTRAL PARK.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.383
THERE WAS THIS OLD WOMAN
RIGHT AT THE PARK'S ENTRANCE

06:56.484 --> 06:59.587
SELLING THESE
LITTLE WOODEN TOYS.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.623
SHE LOOKED SO MISERABLE.

07:04.091 --> 07:08.095
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,
"IT'S WORSE FOR HER."

07:09.563 --> 07:11.064
I HAD JUST ENOUGH MONEY
LEFT FROM MY ALLOWANCE

07:11.164 --> 07:12.866
TO BUY THE BOAT.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.138
BY THE TIME WE CAME HOME,
IT WAS OVER.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.574
WHAT WAS OVER?

07:20.674 --> 07:23.677
- THEIR MARRIAGE.
- OH.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.746
ACTUALLY, I THINK IT WAS
OVER DURING THE VACATION

07:25.846 --> 07:28.048
BUT THEY WERE, LIKE,
PRETENDING OR SOMETHING.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.385
I WENT TO SCHOOL,
I WENT TO PRACTICE

07:32.486 --> 07:36.624
AND I CAME HOME
AND THEY WERE WAITING
FOR ME IN THE KITCHEN,

07:36.724 --> 07:39.292
SMILING LIKE
THOSE MOVIE STARS.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.529
LIKE MOVIE STARS?

07:41.629 --> 07:45.766
YOU KNOW, THOSE SMILES
THAT MOVIE STARS DO?

07:45.866 --> 07:48.401
THOSE BIG SMILES
BUT THEIR EYES ARE ALL
GLAZED OVER.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.838
LIKE--

07:52.540 --> 07:54.608
AND THEN MY MOTHER
STARTS TO CRY.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.577
THEN MY FATHER SAYS
TO HER IN THIS VOICE...

07:56.677 --> 07:58.411
( deep voice )
"OLIVIA, LEAVE IT TO ME."

07:58.512 --> 08:00.848
AND THEN HE STARTS
TO CRY.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.551
AND I'M JUST
STANDING THERE
STUCK IN THE KITCHEN

08:03.651 --> 08:06.754
HUNGRY AS FUCK
WITH THESE TWO BABIES.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.961
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE DAY HE ACTUALLY LEFT.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.763
I JUST REMEMBER
THAT DAY IN THE KITCHEN.

08:15.863 --> 08:19.933
- WHERE DID HE GO?
- BACK TO NEW YORK

08:20.033 --> 08:23.470
WITH HIS NEW WIFE.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.706
AND I STAYED HERE
WITH MY MOTHER

08:25.806 --> 08:28.008
WHO'S TOTALLY
DEPRESSED.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.946
CY AND DARLENE--
THEY LIVED CLOSE BY,

08:33.046 --> 08:37.450
SO THEY HELPED ME GET
TO PRACTICE AND BACK.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.720
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME
TO GIVE IT UP.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.593
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.796
IT'S JUST THE WAY
YOU TALK ABOUT IT,

08:48.896 --> 08:51.599
LIKE YOU'RE NOT SO UPSET
ABOUT THE BREAKUP

08:51.699 --> 08:54.868
AS THE WAY THEY DID IT.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.871
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S MAKING YOU SAD.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.740
I'M NOT SAD.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.511
IS THAT WHAT
PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED
TO DO IN THERAPY?

09:04.612 --> 09:07.247
SIT AROUND AND WHINE
OVER ALL THEIR PROBLEMS?

09:08.381 --> 09:11.652
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.988
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD DO.
I AM NOTHING LIKE HER--

09:15.088 --> 09:17.024
YOUR MOM?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.494
WHERE WAS YOUR DAD
WHILE ALL THIS
WAS GOING ON?

09:21.595 --> 09:23.831
I TOLD YOU,
IN NEW YORK WITH NATASHA.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.633
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER
LIVING WITH THEM?

09:25.733 --> 09:30.403
NO. WE ONCE
THOUGHT MAYBE,
BUT...

09:30.503 --> 09:32.740
- IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
- WHY NOT?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.811
THEY NEEDED THEIR SPACE.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.651
THEY DIDN'T LAST ANYWAY.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.487
HE WANTED ME
TO LIVE WITH THEM.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.523
HE WAS REALLY PISSED
THAT SHE SAID NO,

09:50.624 --> 09:53.126
SO IT REALLY SOURED
THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.762
SO YOU BLAME YOURSELF?

09:54.862 --> 09:58.766
WHATEVER WAY
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES,
YOU'RE STILL TO BLAME?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.771
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

10:05.072 --> 10:07.040
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HOW OLD AM I?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.209
PEOPLE REALLY DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.144
REALLY?

10:13.580 --> 10:18.085
YOUR LOGIC HAS
SOME FLAWS, SOPHIE.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.689
YOU AREN'T
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
YOUR PARENTS DID.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.291
YOU-- YOU COULDN'T BE.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.398
WERE YOU
A GYMNAST BEFORE--

10:31.498 --> 10:33.801
BEFORE YOU MET CY?

10:33.901 --> 10:37.637
I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME
BEFORE I MET CY.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.809
I'VE KNOWN HIM
SINCE I WAS SO LITTLE.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.077
BESIDES MY FATHER,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.880
THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO EVER BELIEVED IN ME.

10:48.415 --> 10:52.152
CY DISCOVERED ME
GYMNASTICALLY.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.188
I WAS DANCING AROUND
ON A LOG IN THE BACKYARD

10:55.288 --> 10:57.090
TO ENTERTAIN DANA.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.426
YOU KNOW,
DOING SPINS AND THINGS.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.661
HE PUT ME ON A BEAM
THE NEXT DAY.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.498
THEIR HOUSE WAS
LIKE MY HOUSE.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.168
I HAD A KEY.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.669
BEFORE MY FATHER LEFT,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.705
WHEN HE AND MY
MOM WERE FIGHTING
ALL THE TIME,

11:11.805 --> 11:14.641
I SLEPT OVER.

11:14.742 --> 11:18.445
I HAD THESE REALLY BAD
ATTACKS BACK THEN.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.647
MY STOMACH WOULD
START TO SHAKE

11:20.748 --> 11:23.817
AND THEN MY WHOLE BODY
WOULD START TO SHAKE.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.386
SOMETIMES I'D START
THROWING UP

11:26.486 --> 11:28.155
AND I COULDN'T
MAKE IT STOP.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.860
THEY TOOK ME
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
ONE NIGHT.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.996
WE NEVER TOLD MY PARENTS.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.431
WHY NOT?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.838
I RUINED THEIR FAMILY.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.607
I DID,
I REALLY DID.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.311
DARLENE WAS
SO GOOD TO ME.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.947
I WAS--

11:54.047 --> 11:56.483
SHE REALLY
WAS GOOD TO ME.

11:58.185 --> 12:01.955
SHE TOLD ME BEFORE
SHE LEFT FOR WISCONSIN

12:02.055 --> 12:04.925
THAT SHE WAS ONLY GOING
BECAUSE SHE KNEW
I WOULD BE THERE

12:05.025 --> 12:07.727
TO TAKE CARE OF DANA.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.431
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T TRUST CY,
BUT SHE TRUSTED ME.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.101
SHE TRUSTED ME
AND I RUINED IT.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.174
YOU'RE THINKING
HE USED ME.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.376
YOU'RE WRONG.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.278
HE KEPT TRYING
TO STOP ME.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.415
HE KEPT SAYING,
"SOPHIE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.052
WE'LL GET
TO A PLACE AND THERE'LL
BE NO TURNING BACK."

12:32.152 --> 12:35.155
HE'S A REALLY GOOD
PERSON, CY IS.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.224
HE'S A GENTLEMAN.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.796
HE KEPT SAYING,
"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING."

12:42.896 --> 12:44.497
BUT THE THING IS, I DID.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.801
AND WHAT WERE YOU
DOING, SOPHIE?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.372
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY IMAGINATION.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.876
AND THEN HE STOPPED
TALKING TO ME WHILE
DARLENE WAS HOME.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.511
YOU KNOW,
LIKE HE WAS EMBARRASSED,

12:58.611 --> 13:01.748
LIKE HE WAS
HIDING SOMETHING.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.917
AND SOMETIMES I'D CATCH HIM
HOLDING HIS BREATH

13:04.017 --> 13:05.886
WHILE HE WAS
LOOKING AT ME.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.359
HE LOVES ME,
I KNOW HE DOES.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.464
SO I KNEW EVEN BEFORE
DARLENE WENT AWAY,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.566
I KNEW
THAT HE LOVED ME.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.103
AND THEN SHE LEFT
FOR SIX MONTHS

13:23.203 --> 13:25.839
BUT CY WOULDN'T
HAVE SEX WITH ME

13:25.939 --> 13:28.741
EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE
ASSUMED WE WERE DOING IT,

13:28.842 --> 13:31.912
THAT WE'D BEEN DOING IT
FOR MONTHS.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.015
CY SAID IT WAS A LINE
THAT WE ABSOLUTELY

13:35.115 --> 13:38.051
POSITIVELY WOULD
NOT CROSS.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.168
WE'D BEEN SLEEPING
IN THE SAME BED--

13:55.268 --> 13:56.970
JUST SLEEPING.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.772
AND THEN ONE NIGHT,

13:59.873 --> 14:02.142
THE NIGHT BEFORE DARLENE
CAME HOME,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.412
I WOKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

14:05.512 --> 14:07.915
AND HE WAS AWAKE.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.018
THEN HE--

14:12.585 --> 14:14.955
I--

14:16.957 --> 14:19.359
IT HAPPENED.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.965
IT FELT LIKE
NOTHING AT ALL.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.273
LIKE NOTHING?

14:33.373 --> 14:37.144
NOT GOOD? NOT BAD?

14:40.080 --> 14:43.216
KIND OF LIKE--

14:43.316 --> 14:45.652
KIND OF LIKE I WAS
WATCHING IT HAPPEN...

14:47.654 --> 14:50.991
ON A REALLY SMALL
BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.826
LIKE I WAS CHECKING
MY E-MAIL

14:53.927 --> 14:55.929
AT THE SAME TIME.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.598
LIKE I WASN'T
REALLY THERE.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.603
I DON'T KNOW.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.243
THE NEXT DAY WE PRETENDED
LIKE IT HADN'T HAPPENED.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.981
THEN AT PRACTICE
THAT AFTERNOON

15:14.081 --> 15:18.585
WE HAD THIS BIG FIGHT
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.653
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.257
BECAUSE I FELL OFF
THE BEAM.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.327
I'D BEEN GOING
FOR THIS BACK BEND

15:27.427 --> 15:29.562
AND FOR SOME REASON
I THOUGHT THE BEAM

15:29.662 --> 15:31.931
WAS LONGER
THAN IT REALLY WAS

15:32.032 --> 15:35.068
SO I BENT RIGHT
OFF OF IT.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.337
I FELL FLAT
ON MY BACK.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.975
I JUST STAYED THERE

15:42.075 --> 15:44.077
TRYING TO BREATHE,

15:44.177 --> 15:46.279
AFRAID TO MOVE,

15:46.379 --> 15:48.581
AFRAID THAT
I'D BROKEN SOMETHING.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.588
THEN CY CAME OVER
AND STARTED SCREAMING AT ME.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.857
"WE'VE GOT TWO DAYS
UNTIL THIS TOURNAMENT

15:57.957 --> 15:59.459
AND YOU'VE LOST
YOUR FOCUS.

15:59.559 --> 16:03.096
NOW GET BACK UP THERE
AND DO IT RIGHT."

16:08.968 --> 16:12.072
THAT NIGHT I SLEPT
ON THE COUCH.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.143
THEN IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT CY CAME IN

16:16.243 --> 16:18.745
AND I THOUGHT THAT--

16:20.147 --> 16:23.016
BUT HE WANTED ME
TO PUT DANA BACK TO BED.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.521
SHE'D HAD A BAD DREAM AND COME
INTO HIS ROOM LOOKING FOR ME.

16:28.621 --> 16:33.693
SO I PUT HER BACK TO BED
AND THEN WE TALKED.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.900
HE KEPT TALKING
ABOUT MY POTENTIAL.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.671
HE SAID IT WOULD RUIN
BOTH OF OUR CAREERS
IF THIS GOT OUT.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.709
HE SAID WE HAD
TO STOP.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.648
THAT'S IT.

16:57.917 --> 17:01.654
WE ALMOST
HAD SEX AGAIN THAT NIGHT,
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.592
THAT'S IT.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.603
A FEW WEEKS LATER

17:16.703 --> 17:19.639
DARLENE SAID SHE WANTED
TO TALK TO ME.

17:21.474 --> 17:24.844
SHE SAID
THAT DANA HAD BECOME
TOO ATTACHED TO ME

17:24.944 --> 17:26.646
WHILE SHE WAS IN WISCONSIN

17:26.746 --> 17:29.382
AND I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
COME OVER FOR AWHILE.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.354
BUT IT WAS PATHETIC

17:34.454 --> 17:37.023
BECAUSE I KNOW HER,
YOU KNOW?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.426
SHE WAS LYING TO ME.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.196
I COULDN'T LOOK AT HER.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.735
I JUST SAID I'M SORRY.

17:50.337 --> 17:54.207
SHE SAID,
"DON'T BE SILLY.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.310
KIDS FORGET QUICKLY.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.480
GROWNUPS DON'T
BUT KIDS DO.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.283
DANA WILL FORGET YOU."

18:04.651 --> 18:07.554
DANA WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU, SOPHIE.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.889
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.192
I'M SURE OF IT.

18:13.326 --> 18:17.197
DARLENE IS
TERRIBLY WRONG.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.768
GROWNUPS CAN FORGET;

18:22.635 --> 18:24.771
CHILDREN CAN'T.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.414
WHEN I LEFT,
DARLENE GAVE ME A PRESENT

18:34.514 --> 18:36.183
THAT SHE GOT
FOR ME IN WISCONSIN.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.018
WHAT WAS IT?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.020
AN APRON...

18:41.120 --> 18:43.756
WITH COWS ON IT.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.293
SHE KNOWS I LIKE TO COOK

18:46.393 --> 18:48.661
AND I COLLECT THINGS
WITH COWS ON THEM.

18:48.761 --> 18:52.165
SO IT WAS SORT OF...

18:52.265 --> 18:55.001
- PERFECT.
- HMM.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.737
THE ACCIDENT...

18:57.837 --> 18:59.839
IT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.412
I WOKE UP
IN THE AMBULANCE.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.247
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU GOT THERE?

19:07.347 --> 19:10.317
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WALKING AWAY
FROM THE HOUSE.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.520
I REMEMBER HER GIVING ME
THE APRON.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.723
I DIDN'T WANT IT.
I TRIED TO GIVE IT BACK...

19:18.057 --> 19:20.227
BUT SHE SAID,

19:20.327 --> 19:22.829
"TAKE IT SO YOU DON'T
GET DIRTY."

19:27.099 --> 19:29.469
AND THEN I THINK
SHE KISSED ME.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.841
IT MUST'VE BEEN
AT THEIR DOOR

19:34.941 --> 19:38.445
BECAUSE NOW I REMEMBER
STEPPING BACK AND SEEING
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.614
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?
- NOTHING.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.183
I SAW THE HOUSE
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

19:44.284 --> 19:46.653
THAT'S ALL.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.893
"I'LL HUFF
AND I'LL PUFF

19:53.993 --> 19:56.796
AND I'LL BLOW
YOUR HOUSE DOWN."

20:07.340 --> 20:10.910
SO WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU GONNA WRITE NOW?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.880
ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I THINK THE ACCIDENT
WAS YOUR FAULT?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.415
YES.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.550
WHEN YOU CAME HERE
THIS MORNING

20:17.650 --> 20:19.686
YOU TOLD ME THAT
THEY WOULD GOING TO
TAKE THE CASTS--

20:19.786 --> 20:22.589
- YOU'RE STALLING, PAUL.
- I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN
TO YOU--

20:22.689 --> 20:24.824
YOU KNOW, BUT YOU'RE AFRAID
TO TELL ME.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.659
SOPHIE, WHAT I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND--

20:26.759 --> 20:28.295
I UNDERSTAND!

20:28.395 --> 20:29.962
I UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.300
I UNDERSTAND
WHY DARLENE KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.635
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE LYING
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.236
OKAY, I GET IT!

20:37.337 --> 20:39.906
- I FUCKING GET IT!
- SOPHIE...

20:40.006 --> 20:42.575
LET'S FINISH
THE SESSION.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.647
- I HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM.
- OKAY.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.820
( glass shatters )

21:27.920 --> 21:29.889
SOPHIE?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.393
SOPHIE?

21:34.527 --> 21:38.264
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ( knocks )

21:38.365 --> 21:40.900
I'M GONNA OPEN
THE DOOR NOW.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.904
- IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.615
I'M SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT HAPPENED.

21:55.715 --> 21:59.285
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.355
- I'M SO SORRY.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.257
IT'S JUST A PICTURE FRAME.
I CAN CLEAN IT UP LATER ON.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.326
I DON'T WANNA FUCK
EVERYTHING UP HERE TOO.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.795
NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.797
IF YOU HAD TO WRITE
THE EVALUATION NOW--

22:10.897 --> 22:13.633
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE
THE EVALUATION NOW, SOPHIE.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.268
IF SOMEONE HELD A GUN
TO YOUR HEAD--

22:16.369 --> 22:17.970
ARE YOU HOLDING
THE GUN?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.640
- I WANNA KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK!
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.775
DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU DID THIS
TO YOURSELF?

22:22.875 --> 22:26.212
I DON'T REMEMBER!
HOW MANY TIMES DO
I HAVE TO TELL YOU?!

22:26.312 --> 22:28.948
- WHAT DOES
YOUR INSTINCT TELL YOU?
- I DON'T HAVE ANY INSTINCT.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.785
- WHAT DOES
YOUR HEART TELL YOU?
- I DON'T HAVE A HEART.

22:34.621 --> 22:37.824
FROM WHAT YOU'VE
TOLD ME ALREADY,

22:37.924 --> 22:40.126
I THINK THAT
YOU'RE HAVING QUITE
A DIFFICULT TIME

22:40.226 --> 22:42.795
- TAKING CARE OF
YOURSELF RECENTLY.
- SO?

22:42.895 --> 22:46.165
SO IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU DELIBERATELY
RAN INTO THAT CAR.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.768
SO WHAT WOULD YOU WRITE?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.003
UM...

22:51.103 --> 22:54.407
I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES OF...

22:56.208 --> 22:59.378
"AS A RESULT
OF THE ANXIETY

22:59.479 --> 23:02.449
SHE FELT PRECEDING
THE INCIDENT,

23:02.549 --> 23:04.617
THE SUBJECT MAY
HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED,

23:04.717 --> 23:08.588
ACTED IRRESPONSIBLY
BUT WE CANNOT CONCLUDE

23:08.688 --> 23:11.791
THAT THE ACCIDENT
WAS A PREMEDITATED,
WILLFUL ACT--"

23:11.891 --> 23:15.061
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY VAGUE.
- I CAN'T BE ANY MORE
SPECIFIC THAN THAT.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.696
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.865
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE
THAN WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.700
I FUCKING HATE YOU!

23:20.800 --> 23:22.869
YOU NEVER SAY
WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.037
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST
LIKE ALL THE REST OF THEM.

23:25.137 --> 23:29.676
WHY CAN'T ANYONE EVER TELL
ANYONE ELSE THE TRUTH?

23:29.776 --> 23:33.580
I CAN'T LISTEN
TO ANY MORE OF YOUR
STUPID BULLSHIT WORDS.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.082
"A WILLFUL
AND IRRESPONSIBLE ACT"?

23:36.182 --> 23:39.819
JUST SAY IT--
SHE TRIED TO KILL
HERSELF OR NOT.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.155
IF YOU THINK
I DID, THEN SAY SO!
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.324
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

23:45.424 --> 23:48.060
BETWEEN NOT BEING CAREFUL

23:48.160 --> 23:49.796
BECAUSE YOU
FEEL VULNERABLE

23:49.896 --> 23:52.331
AND WANTING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.500
NO!

23:53.600 --> 23:54.967
YOU DON'T SEE
THE DIFFERENCE?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.770
NO! IT'S JUST LIKE
THE PICTURE FRAME.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.540
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK IT.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.042
BUT IT'S BROKEN.
I BROKE IT.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.611
IN TERMS
OF THE EVALUATION,

24:04.711 --> 24:06.679
THERE'S A REALLY BIG
DIFFERENCE.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.849
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO GET
YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.084
- WHAT?
- SOPHIE, THE PROBLEMS
THAT YOU HAD

24:12.184 --> 24:15.254
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT--
THEY'RE STILL THERE.

24:15.354 --> 24:18.457
EVEN WHEN THEY TAKE OFF
THE NECKBRACE AND TAKE OFF
THE CASTS,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.827
THOSE PROBLEMS ARE
STILL GOING TO BE THERE

24:20.927 --> 24:24.997
WHEN YOU GO
BACK TO YOUR NORMAL
EVERYDAY ROUTINE.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.034
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FACE THEM AGAIN.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.713
'CAUSE IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL,
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD
HAPPEN AGAIN.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.750
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY ASKING ME,
ISN'T IT?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.653
IF YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR LIFE,

24:46.753 --> 24:49.488
WILL YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN FRONT OF A CAR

24:49.589 --> 24:51.624
AGAIN SOMEDAY SOON?

24:59.532 --> 25:02.501
YOU MAKE ME SOUND
LIKE A TIME BOMB.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.608
IT'S TRUE,
I RUIN EVERYTHING.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.210
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.746
YOU SAID I WANTED TO GO HOME
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE

25:13.846 --> 25:16.616
FOR ME TO RUIN THERE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.485
WELL, LET'S LOOK AT IT
ANOTHER WAY.

25:19.586 --> 25:22.454
YOU COULD REALLY BUILD
SOMETHING AT HOME.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.057
WITH MY MOTHER?
ARE YOU ON CRACK?

25:25.157 --> 25:27.293
( snickers )

25:30.462 --> 25:33.399
I HAVE TO GO SOON.

25:33.499 --> 25:36.535
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU GO?

25:36.636 --> 25:38.871
WHERE DO YOU FEEL...

25:38.971 --> 25:41.540
SAFE?

25:41.641 --> 25:44.076
- WHAT?
- WHERE ARE YOU HAPPY?

25:44.176 --> 25:45.745
WHERE DO YOU FEEL--

25:45.845 --> 25:48.447
WHERE DO YOU FEEL SAFE?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.449
I WAS HAPPY
WITH CY AND DANA.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.018
I RUINED IT.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.220
YOU ERASED THE DRAWING
FROM YOUR CAST.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.088
'CAUSE I WAS ANGRY.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.991
IS THERE ANYWHERE ELSE
THAT YOU'RE HAPPY?

26:03.495 --> 26:06.733
ON THE BEAM.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.736
I CAN SPEND HOURS
WALKING BACK AND FORTH--

26:09.836 --> 26:11.838
DIVE, DIVE AND SWISH.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.941
"DIVE, DIVE AND SWISH"?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

26:15.041 --> 26:19.011
IT'S A SONG
I SING TO MYSELF
WHEN I'M UP THERE.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.050
IT REMINDS ME
OF A PELICAN DIVING DOWN
TO CATCH A FISH IN ITS BEAK.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.318
COULD I HEAR THE SONG?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.627
( singing )

26:43.903 --> 26:46.639
AND ON THE DIVE
I DROP MY FOOT
OFF THE BEAM

26:46.739 --> 26:49.776
AND ON THE SWISH
I SWING IT BACK UP.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.015
- YOU FEEL SAFE UP THERE?
- YES.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.517
HMM.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.620
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
LIVE UP THERE FOREVER.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.891
YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN
EVENTUALLY.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.165
( sighs )

27:33.720 --> 27:36.088
GOODBYE, SOPHIE.

27:41.427 --> 27:44.764
HELLO,
THIS IS PAUL WESTON.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.933
I AM YOUR DAUGHTER'S
THERAPIST

27:47.033 --> 27:50.636
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.638
I UNDERSTAND
THEY'RE ABOUT TO REMOVE

27:52.739 --> 27:55.641
SOPHIE'S NECKBRACE
AND HER CASTS

27:55.742 --> 27:57.910
AND I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD DISCUSS

27:58.010 --> 27:59.812
HER RETURN TO THE GYM
AND TO TRAINING.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.881
SO WOULD YOU MIND
CALLING ME, PLEASE,

28:01.981 --> 28:04.216
AT MY OFFICE?
THANK YOU.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.252
( hangs up )

28:06.352 --> 28:08.755
( theme music playing )
