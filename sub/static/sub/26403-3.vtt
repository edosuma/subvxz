00:08.520 --> 00:11.176
This person, or thing,

00:11.179 --> 00:12.897
that came out of our basement...

00:15.867 --> 00:17.764
That's what killed our friend, Jason.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.732
Somehow, I think I created him

00:20.733 --> 00:22.637
or invited him.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.957
When your father left,
this figure became real,

00:25.960 --> 00:28.833
and losing Jason made
you think about him again.

00:28.836 --> 00:31.412
So do you think that this figure feels

00:31.415 --> 00:33.097
more real to you

00:33.100 --> 00:34.899
when you're in distress?

00:34.900 --> 00:37.632
You shouldn't have gone
to see the baby like that.

00:37.633 --> 00:40.490
- You crossed a boundary.
- He looks just like me.

00:40.493 --> 00:43.166
You and your husband, do
you fight with him a lot?

00:43.167 --> 00:45.298
I mean, all couples fight.

00:45.301 --> 00:47.499
We have some things
we have to figure out.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.566
But it's just part of being married.

00:49.567 --> 00:50.699
Is it?

00:50.700 --> 00:53.099
There is an ocean

00:53.100 --> 00:55.699
inside of you.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.166
And you can rest at the bottom.

01:00.167 --> 01:02.499
Find the silence there.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.866
Use the silence.

02:49.367 --> 02:51.499
Come on!

02:51.500 --> 02:53.266
Come on! Come on!

02:56.346 --> 02:58.112
Shit!

02:58.115 --> 03:00.130
Shit!

03:28.867 --> 03:30.532
My God.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.166
Are you okay?

03:32.167 --> 03:35.399
Hello, 911.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.232
We just had a car accident.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.499
That's it? You can't
give me more information?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.832
Fine, okay.

03:50.833 --> 03:53.432
Yes. Yes, I'm on my way.

04:24.993 --> 04:26.597
Hey.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.050
S... sorry. I...

04:28.053 --> 04:29.799
- What are you doing here?
- I... I was just outside

04:29.800 --> 04:31.199
and I, saw your dog running around.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
Your door was open.

04:32.201 --> 04:33.799
I... I didn't mean to...

04:33.800 --> 04:36.632
- Are you okay?
- Um...

04:36.633 --> 04:41.132
would you mind sticking
around for a few minutes?

04:41.133 --> 04:42.899
Yeah, yeah.

04:42.900 --> 04:47.399
Sure, sure.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.667
They...

04:50.700 --> 04:52.699
they didn't say how serious an accident.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.202
Just that I should bring his clothes.

04:55.205 --> 04:57.432
Well, sometimes they have
to cut people's clothes off

04:57.433 --> 04:59.432
to get them out of the car, you know?

04:59.433 --> 05:02.999
He wasn't wearing clothes.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.799
They said it sounded like...

05:08.800 --> 05:10.432
like someone was after him.

05:10.433 --> 05:14.066
- After him?
- Like chasing him.

05:14.067 --> 05:15.732
Attacked him.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.599
Like how someone attacked
your friend who got killed?

05:18.600 --> 05:22.166
I don't know.

05:22.167 --> 05:23.632
I think so.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.666
Hey, why... Why don't you let me drive?

05:25.667 --> 05:28.366
You... you seem kind of upset.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.666
Yeah, um...

05:30.667 --> 05:32.767
yeah, thanks.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.332
Hey, man.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.699
You all right?

05:41.700 --> 05:44.487
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be okay.
- Ian drove me.

05:44.490 --> 05:46.599
Yeah, we were worried about you.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.632
Thanks.

05:49.633 --> 05:52.334
- Thanks for bringing her.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:52.337 --> 05:55.039
- Um, you should get back.
- You sure?

05:55.042 --> 05:56.399
No, you don't have to stay here.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.872
I can if you need anything.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.799
- No.
- Nah.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.132
We don't know how long they're
gonna keep me here, so...

06:02.133 --> 06:03.399
Sure.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.716
Yeah, well, um, you
know where I live so...

06:06.719 --> 06:08.166
Thanks.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.900
Hey, feel better, dude.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.999
Thanks.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.133
Dude.

06:50.167 --> 06:54.432
I've never tried floating
meditation before.

06:54.433 --> 06:57.266
Is it relaxing?

06:57.267 --> 06:59.300
It was.

07:03.033 --> 07:06.167
Why didn't you tell me
you were going there?

07:07.533 --> 07:09.366
I don't know.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.167
I should have.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.032
Was there...

07:18.033 --> 07:21.699
any reason why you felt
like you needed to go there?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.966
Jill.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.366
Tom.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.299
I wanna know.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.599
You guys up for a little visit?

07:47.998 --> 07:50.130
Nah, I don't need to watch it.

07:50.133 --> 07:51.266
I was there.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.532
You know, in most cases like this

07:53.533 --> 07:55.099
we would wonder whether the goal

07:55.100 --> 07:57.766
was to kill her and you
just happened to be there.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.812
But all things being considered,

07:59.815 --> 08:02.666
it's much more likely
the goal was to get you.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.766
Who knew you were gonna be there?

08:07.233 --> 08:10.116
Because this Vanessa Moss
didn't really advertise

08:10.119 --> 08:12.532
this Jacuzzi closet anywhere.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.092
In fact, she's mostly a doula.

08:14.095 --> 08:15.494
Did I say that right? "Doula"?

08:15.497 --> 08:16.630
She delivers babies.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.484
A doula.

08:18.487 --> 08:22.230
Yeah, this whole floating
meditation mumbo-jumbo,

08:22.233 --> 08:24.967
the clientele is mostly word of mouth.

08:26.367 --> 08:28.532
Did a friend refer you?

08:28.533 --> 08:30.666
You're in her phone.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.999
There's one linked contact.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.599
Who is "Sarah Winters"?

08:38.832 --> 08:40.529
I did some work for her a while back.

08:40.532 --> 08:43.499
I mean she... yeah, I
guess she knows Vanessa.

08:45.867 --> 08:50.466
Do either of you know
the person in this video?

08:50.467 --> 08:52.332
Or have any idea why...

08:52.333 --> 08:55.232
he would like a Dr. Seuss
character gone wrong?

08:55.233 --> 08:56.799
No.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.832
No?

08:58.833 --> 09:03.232
His mask, it's, um...

09:03.233 --> 09:05.984
it looks like this
character that Jill created

09:05.987 --> 09:07.299
when we were kids.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.029
She just... she used
to do these drawings.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.344
Come again?

09:11.347 --> 09:12.932
Okay, there are a lot of these drawings

09:12.933 --> 09:14.199
in our basement, right?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.932
So if this person was hiding there

09:15.933 --> 09:18.199
then he probably saw
them and made himself up

09:18.200 --> 09:20.732
to look like that or something.

09:20.733 --> 09:23.632
I mean, this... This
person's obviously insane

09:23.633 --> 09:26.199
or on drugs... PCP, something.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.866
He got shot multiple times...
It didn't even slow him down.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.899
But why is he interested in you two?

09:32.900 --> 09:36.432
Why does he try to kill you...

09:36.433 --> 09:39.467
but make a point of
letting your wife live?

09:51.267 --> 09:52.899
Hey, Unagi.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.300
Hello.

10:03.274 --> 10:06.374
I really think we should go to a hotel.

10:12.967 --> 10:15.366
I have to show you something first.

10:18.533 --> 10:20.466
Jill...

10:22.533 --> 10:25.832
What?

10:25.833 --> 10:28.600
You really didn't see that guy's face?

10:30.767 --> 10:33.932
Did you or didn't you?

10:33.933 --> 10:35.466
Do you know who this person is?

10:35.467 --> 10:38.032
Do you know why he's dressed like this?

10:41.122 --> 10:42.799
He's me.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.032
What?

10:45.033 --> 10:47.499
Come on, I wanna show you something.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.730
- Hey, Mommy.
- Hey.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.999
Hope you're ready for breakfast.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.728
Yes, I'm starving. Looks delicious.

11:25.731 --> 11:30.132
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.339
What's that...

11:32.342 --> 11:34.432
What are you looking at, sweetheart?

11:34.433 --> 11:37.166
It's my favorite YouTube video.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.299
- YouTube video.
- I had no idea.

11:42.133 --> 11:45.632
- You guys okay on drinks?
- I'm good.

11:58.833 --> 12:01.332
He was there to protect me.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.286
Protect you? From what?

12:04.289 --> 12:06.721
Anything painful.

12:06.724 --> 12:09.824
I know it sounds crazy.

12:11.798 --> 12:15.197
When I was little, I
used to lie awake at night

12:15.200 --> 12:18.666
thinking about all the bad
things that could happen.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.366
To me, to my parents...

12:26.091 --> 12:28.099
After my dad took me to the circus,

12:28.100 --> 12:31.632
I came up with Pretzel Jack.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.299
I used to draw my stories about him

12:33.300 --> 12:35.566
and put them under my bed.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.266
When my dad left...

12:40.267 --> 12:44.199
that's when he became real.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.966
Real?

12:45.967 --> 12:48.899
How?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.299
He walked out of a little door

12:50.300 --> 12:53.832
in the back of my closet.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.332
Like that one.

13:07.367 --> 13:10.866
He slept under my bed.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.032
And then a few months later,

13:13.033 --> 13:15.466
Mom and I moved away.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.799
It wasn't like I forgot about him,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.532
it's just...

13:19.533 --> 13:22.799
it felt more and more like a dream.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.099
Except now he's back.

13:35.967 --> 13:37.999
What is that?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.432
It's him.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.732
From back then.

13:44.233 --> 13:47.599
I don't know what that is.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.066
Pretzel Jack killed
Jason, Tom, and that woman.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.766
You know... you saw him.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.566
Jill, I saw...

13:54.567 --> 13:57.293
a maniac in a mask or something.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.161
So did you.

13:58.164 --> 14:00.759
No, it wasn't a stranger. I felt it.

14:00.762 --> 14:02.566
You felt what?

14:02.567 --> 14:05.632
Some awful connection.

14:05.633 --> 14:08.199
Like family.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.799
It was almost comforting.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.099
Jill, you were in shock.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.866
It was Pretzel Jack.

14:13.867 --> 14:16.099
Somehow he's real.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.399
And he was trying to kill you.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.866
Okay, let's just say all that's true.

14:21.867 --> 14:24.567
Why would Pretzel Jack
want to kill me?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.999
What?

14:30.700 --> 14:33.466
I just told you my secret.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.466
I'm naked here.

14:35.467 --> 14:38.099
You tell me yours.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.899
Why didn't you tell me about the kid?

15:19.500 --> 15:22.532
Sarah Winters called, and I answered.

15:22.533 --> 15:25.866
I heard the baby crying.

15:25.867 --> 15:29.500
You have a kid with this
woman, Sarah Winters.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.232
Tell me I'm wrong.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.481
The time you and I reconnected,

15:47.484 --> 15:50.118
but when you and I got
together for real, Jill,

15:50.121 --> 15:51.344
we ended it.

15:51.347 --> 15:54.030
Wasn't till later I found
out she was pregnant.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.032
Jill, she's married, okay?

15:59.033 --> 16:02.432
Her husband thinks
that the kid is his son.

16:02.433 --> 16:05.332
She doesn't want him to know.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.466
Her husband thinks the kid is his.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.466
Yeah.

16:13.467 --> 16:16.132
But he's your son.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.466
Yeah.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.299
Pretty sure that's my kid.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.532
How old is he?

16:25.533 --> 16:28.566
Eight months, one week.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.860
Why the fuck didn't you tell me then?

16:30.863 --> 16:33.732
Because, you know, Jill,
I remembered about your dad

16:33.733 --> 16:35.516
wrecking marriages, screwing up kids.

16:35.519 --> 16:36.814
I fucked up, okay?

16:36.817 --> 16:38.532
Why was it so fucking
easy for you to lie?

16:38.533 --> 16:39.666
It wasn't fucking easy.

16:39.669 --> 16:40.986
You've never been all
the way in this, Jill.

16:40.988 --> 16:42.628
Like, any little mistake I make...

16:42.631 --> 16:43.731
- Little?
- That could be the reason...

16:43.733 --> 16:45.499
- Little mistake?
- I know.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.166
I know. I know how fucked up it is

16:47.167 --> 16:48.599
that I did this to you.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.632
Then why did you do it?

16:50.633 --> 16:52.899
Because I love you, Jill.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.532
You wouldn't have loved
me back if you knew.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.834
I don't know how we can be together

16:59.837 --> 17:01.399
without hurting each other.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.899
- Stop. Stop.
- No.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.665
Jill, yes... yes, we do. We know.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.881
- You know how to do this, Jill.
- I don't know.

17:06.883 --> 17:09.482
I don't know how we fix this.

17:09.484 --> 17:12.098
Let's work on this the right way.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.965
What... what do you mean?

17:13.967 --> 17:16.332
I mean where we're less
likely to hurt each other.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.665
Where?

17:17.666 --> 17:20.632
Where... where do you want to go?

17:43.925 --> 17:45.680
I don't normally accept patients back

17:45.683 --> 17:47.630
after they've fired me,

17:47.633 --> 17:51.499
but considering you're in crisis,

17:51.500 --> 17:53.866
I am going to refer you

17:53.867 --> 17:57.799
to a trauma therapist I know,

17:57.800 --> 18:01.599
as well as a very good marriage

18:01.600 --> 18:04.842
and family therapy guy.

18:04.845 --> 18:06.599
Thanks.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.932
Nice to meet you.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.432
And you.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.966
So...

18:11.967 --> 18:15.866
let's just address
this other thing first.

18:15.867 --> 18:19.032
Imaginary friends do feel real

18:19.033 --> 18:21.332
to the children who invent them.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.600
That's the point.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.632
I already had this conversation.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.599
Look, um...

18:28.600 --> 18:31.066
We're in the middle of a...

18:31.067 --> 18:34.432
perfect storm right
now, relationship-wise.

18:34.433 --> 18:36.899
I fucked up.

18:36.900 --> 18:40.532
I kept a really, really
huge secret from her,

18:40.533 --> 18:42.199
and I want to make it right.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.967
Okay, here's the thing.

18:48.233 --> 18:51.232
What is love?

18:51.233 --> 18:54.366
Real love.

18:54.367 --> 18:58.099
It's two people saying,

18:58.100 --> 19:00.632
"Here I am.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.032
Vulnerable."

19:03.033 --> 19:06.666
And what do we ask of our lovers?

19:06.667 --> 19:08.966
Cherish us.

19:08.967 --> 19:11.133
Protect us.

19:13.933 --> 19:17.100
"Here is my soft underbelly."

19:18.467 --> 19:20.866
Are you gonna hurt me?

19:20.867 --> 19:24.932
You gonna cut me open, spill my guts?

19:24.933 --> 19:26.966
Or...

19:26.967 --> 19:30.543
"are you going to show
me your soft underbelly?"

19:30.546 --> 19:31.699
Okay, but wait.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.066
Going back, because this is important,

19:34.067 --> 19:36.763
this Pretzel Jack thing
is not an illusion.

19:36.766 --> 19:38.599
- It's...
- We, um...

19:38.600 --> 19:40.799
You and I both agree that
there's someone out there

19:40.800 --> 19:43.166
who wants to hurt us...
Or at least hurt me...

19:43.167 --> 19:44.999
And that person has made himself up

19:45.000 --> 19:46.426
to look like Pretzel Jack...

19:46.429 --> 19:48.099
No, no, he hasn't made
himself up to look...

19:48.100 --> 19:49.966
It's something else,
which is why what I saw

19:49.967 --> 19:52.032
- as a kid is relevant now.
- Babe, we both agree

19:52.033 --> 19:54.132
that it's not safe for us, okay?

19:54.133 --> 19:55.382
- Can we just stay there?
- Right, but...

19:55.384 --> 19:57.098
We're not going back
to the house after this.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.540
- We're gonna go get a hotel.
- Yeah, okay, that's fine,

19:59.543 --> 20:02.564
but you have to listen to
what I'm saying, it's related.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.332
Let's throw away this question

20:04.333 --> 20:06.899
of what you saw as a
kid, just for right now.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.632
Why are you both acting like I am a kid?

20:09.633 --> 20:10.880
Funny you say that.

20:10.883 --> 20:13.697
Funny that's how you
perceive you're being treated.

20:13.700 --> 20:17.078
Who has imaginary friends?

20:17.081 --> 20:18.513
Kids.

20:18.621 --> 20:20.697
Kids.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.199
This is not good for me.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.807
This is not good for any of us.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.999
It's maintenance guys.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.232
Tom, I'm not crazy, okay? I'm not crazy.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.099
- No, no, no, don't.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.099
I... I'm just going to tell

20:53.100 --> 20:55.166
whoever it is making
that noise out there

20:55.167 --> 20:56.632
to keep it down.

20:56.633 --> 20:59.432
It's Pretzel Jack.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.132
Jillian...

21:03.133 --> 21:05.932
I'm going to prove to you that it isn't.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.866
If I open this door and
it's not Pretzel Jack,

21:09.867 --> 21:12.066
will that reassure you?

22:32.933 --> 22:34.732
No, no, stay away from him.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.832
No, no, no.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.332
You need to leave, sir.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.799
Do you want me to call the police?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.466
Turn around...

22:51.467 --> 22:54.634
and crawl right back out that window

22:54.637 --> 22:56.572
just the way...

22:56.575 --> 22:58.864
you came.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.799
Come on!

23:18.333 --> 23:19.966
Go, go, go, go!

23:25.300 --> 23:27.299
Drive.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.266
- We should call the cops.
- Trust me.

23:43.267 --> 23:46.099
- Come inside.
- Jill, let's go.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.300
You made him real.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.599
What?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.732
You're special.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.199
- You have a condition.
- Jill.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.866
I know because I have it, too.

23:59.867 --> 24:01.999
I'm just like you.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.675
Here you go.

24:13.678 --> 24:16.343
For you.

24:16.346 --> 24:18.899
Okay.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.799
So, first off, we don't
have a lot of time,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.132
so be open to what I'm telling you,

24:22.133 --> 24:24.232
crazy as it sounds.

24:24.233 --> 24:25.999
Because the longer that you resist,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.899
the more danger everyone
around you is in,

24:27.900 --> 24:30.999
especially him.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.332
And whatever you do, stay calm,

24:33.333 --> 24:35.591
'cause your distress is like

24:35.594 --> 24:37.799
the fucking Bat signal, okay?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.999
He's out there, and he'll
come when you call him,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.566
whether you mean to or not.

24:42.567 --> 24:43.966
Okay.

24:43.967 --> 24:45.799
What did you tell him?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.599
Everybody has...

24:47.600 --> 24:51.066
their own emotional stuff, right?

24:52.367 --> 24:55.499
You know, anxiety
issues, hang-ups, fears.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.232
But for you and I, that stuff...

24:58.233 --> 25:01.466
can become real.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.299
Pretzel Jack is my stuff?

25:04.300 --> 25:05.799
Right, exactly.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.576
I mean, everybody has
secret doors, right?

25:08.579 --> 25:11.832
But you and I can open ours.

25:14.233 --> 25:16.466
Now, I don't know what issues

25:16.467 --> 25:19.199
you might be dealing with,
but, if I was to guess,

25:19.200 --> 25:21.566
I would say that Pretzel Jack

25:21.567 --> 25:25.932
is something like your emotional

25:25.933 --> 25:27.632
defense system.

25:27.633 --> 25:30.266
How? How is that possible?

25:30.267 --> 25:33.032
I don't know, but I'm guessing

25:33.033 --> 25:36.238
Tom triggered it last night, right?

25:36.241 --> 25:38.866
Anyway, it's probably not the
first thing you've manifested.

25:38.867 --> 25:40.632
For me, it started young.

25:40.633 --> 25:43.266
I mean, these things we
make as kids, they're...

25:43.267 --> 25:44.966
They're like old toys, right?

25:44.967 --> 25:48.621
You know, may be weird and beat up,

25:48.624 --> 25:51.091
but they're comforting.

25:53.633 --> 25:55.866
Jill.

25:55.867 --> 25:58.266
What's more likely, here?

25:58.267 --> 25:59.866
That there was a maniac in our basement

25:59.867 --> 26:03.299
who saw your drawings, or
that you and our neighbor

26:03.300 --> 26:06.600
can mentally manifest your feelings?

26:08.998 --> 26:10.597
When I was 12,

26:10.600 --> 26:13.266
I went to the National Science Museum.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.299
I saw a jar there with a sort of a...

26:16.300 --> 26:18.599
brain tumor in it.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.806
And it occurred to me, this tumor

26:21.809 --> 26:24.531
is exactly like what we have.

26:24.534 --> 26:27.299
Only our tumor isn't going to kill us,

26:27.300 --> 26:29.432
and it isn't inside the skull.

26:29.433 --> 26:31.899
It's on the outside just...

26:31.900 --> 26:34.199
Just walking around.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.699
Your tumor.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.819
- Yeah, that's what I call it.
- So, what?

26:43.822 --> 26:45.866
This is just, um, some coincidence

26:45.867 --> 26:47.762
that you happen to be our neighbor?

26:47.765 --> 26:50.131
It's not a coincidence.

26:50.134 --> 26:52.133
I mean, put yourself in my shoes.

26:52.136 --> 26:54.169
You... you live your whole
life feeling like you're alone

26:54.171 --> 26:56.231
in the world, and then one
day you wake up and you realize

26:56.233 --> 26:57.532
somebody else shares your condition...

26:57.533 --> 26:59.958
How? How do you realize that?

26:59.961 --> 27:02.493
Because I can feel her.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.695
She can feel me, too.

27:04.698 --> 27:07.098
She just doesn't know it yet.

27:08.633 --> 27:11.499
If that's true, you should
have told me up front.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.266
Yeah, I should have.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.599
I'm sorry.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.499
But I was worried I'd scare you off.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.146
Maybe you would have,

27:21.149 --> 27:24.166
but that was up to me, not you.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.953
Jill.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.238
Say I did create him.

27:32.241 --> 27:34.675
How do I kill him?

27:36.257 --> 27:39.424
Sorry it's so Spartan in here.

27:40.467 --> 27:43.099
Your guys' bedroom is a
little more domestic?

27:45.033 --> 27:46.532
So...

27:46.533 --> 27:48.199
how do you kill them?

27:48.200 --> 27:49.566
Right?

27:49.567 --> 27:51.966
It is possible, though, if you want

27:51.967 --> 27:54.166
to do it physically,
you're really gonna have to,

27:54.167 --> 27:56.432
you know, take them apart.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.732
I'm talking fully smash
the head, cut it off,

27:58.733 --> 28:01.132
throw him in a meat grinder,
fully incinerate him.

28:01.133 --> 28:03.666
That might do it.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.299
But here's the thing, right?

28:05.300 --> 28:07.532
You don't have to kill Pretzel Jack.

28:07.533 --> 28:09.466
You just learn to control him.

28:09.467 --> 28:12.296
He's a part of you.
He's like your hands.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.132
Plus, you can manifest other tumors

28:14.133 --> 28:15.532
whenever you want.

28:15.533 --> 28:16.832
You just gotta be careful.

28:16.833 --> 28:20.200
It... it takes something out of you.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.824
I get that you might be
having a little trouble

28:24.827 --> 28:26.119
swallowing all this.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.932
So how about I show you?

28:29.933 --> 28:32.032
Show us?

28:32.033 --> 28:33.332
Name an animal.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.255
Something small and light.

28:35.258 --> 28:37.458
A werewolf.

28:38.662 --> 28:40.028
What?

28:40.031 --> 28:42.414
We're already talking
about impossible things.

28:42.417 --> 28:44.366
Why don't you make a small,

28:44.367 --> 28:46.299
light werewolf?

28:46.300 --> 28:48.232
A cat.

28:48.233 --> 28:50.599
Make another cat.

28:50.608 --> 28:52.875
I love cats.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.832
What the fuck?

31:04.300 --> 31:06.332
It's a Lykoi.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.366
Werewolf cat.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.599
It's an actual breed.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.231
I didn't just, you know, make it up.

31:12.234 --> 31:13.733
Google it.

31:28.067 --> 31:31.055
This power...

31:31.058 --> 31:33.357
you can learn to control it.

31:41.831 --> 31:43.693
Okay.

31:50.543 --> 31:51.630
So, now what,

31:51.633 --> 31:53.764
there's just a weird door

31:53.767 --> 31:55.299
in your bedroom forever?

31:55.300 --> 31:57.651
Well, once you learn
how to really control it,

31:57.654 --> 31:59.899
you know, you can un-create your doors.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.801
But baby steps.

32:03.972 --> 32:05.571
But I...

32:05.574 --> 32:07.907
I can control him.

32:07.910 --> 32:09.810
Yeah, you can.

32:15.331 --> 32:16.964
What about range?

32:16.967 --> 32:18.566
Range?

32:18.567 --> 32:20.732
Does... could he be anywhere,

32:20.733 --> 32:22.799
or does he have to be within

32:22.800 --> 32:25.732
a certain proximity
for him to, you know,

32:25.733 --> 32:27.299
respond to how I'm feeling?

32:27.300 --> 32:29.399
In my experience, you have to be within

32:29.400 --> 32:31.832
a few hundred miles for it to work.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.266
So what would happen
if I just got on a plane

32:34.267 --> 32:35.766
and went to Japan?

32:35.767 --> 32:38.232
Well, he'd, just stand there,

32:38.233 --> 32:40.999
like a car in neutral
waiting for you to come back

32:41.000 --> 32:44.066
or until he just withered up and died,

32:44.067 --> 32:45.832
which happens eventually.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.999
Either way, it wouldn't fix your problem

32:48.000 --> 32:50.532
because you'd still be at
risk of manifesting a new one

32:50.533 --> 32:52.732
at any moment.

32:52.733 --> 32:54.721
The point is, we gotta figure out

32:54.724 --> 32:56.390
what to do about this one.

32:56.393 --> 32:58.630
Now...

33:01.367 --> 33:03.466
Maybe if we could...

33:04.800 --> 33:06.981
Draw him out and...

33:06.984 --> 33:09.286
trap him.

33:09.289 --> 33:11.367
Then at least you'd
have time to figure out

33:11.370 --> 33:14.069
how to control him.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.766
And how would we do that?

33:22.933 --> 33:25.566
When Pretzel Jack goes after somebody,

33:25.567 --> 33:28.546
what does he think he's
protecting you from?

33:30.118 --> 33:33.150
Disloyalty.

33:33.153 --> 33:36.952
Deception.

33:36.955 --> 33:38.999
Betrayal.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.499
Okay.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.166
Let me get this straight, the only way

33:45.167 --> 33:47.666
to not get me killed is
to try to get me killed?

33:47.667 --> 33:49.066
Is that what we're doing here?

33:49.067 --> 33:51.441
Hey. Relax. I've done this before.

33:51.444 --> 33:53.608
You're in good hands.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.112
I think we should have
waited longer to get married.

34:02.950 --> 34:04.583
What?

34:04.586 --> 34:05.931
I think we should have

34:05.934 --> 34:10.100
gotten to know each other better, first.

34:10.103 --> 34:12.255
We've known each other
for over 20 years.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.342
We knew each other
more than 20 years ago.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.397
There's a difference.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.831
Can we not do this with him here?

34:18.833 --> 34:22.632
It's not supposed to be easy.

34:22.632 --> 34:25.331
He's here to help.

34:25.333 --> 34:29.166
If you want to draw him
out, you have to get hurt.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.774
You have to get really hurt.

34:30.777 --> 34:34.866
You have to be willing
to go where it hurts.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.498
Can you do that?

34:59.403 --> 35:01.499
Okay.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.099
I wish I could tell you she started it.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.499
That's not the truth.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.644
I was in their bedroom

35:12.647 --> 35:14.646
taking measurements...

35:16.247 --> 35:19.080
And I heard this laughter
coming from outside.

35:20.365 --> 35:24.515
She was out there with
her kid, her daughter.

35:24.518 --> 35:27.451
She looked so happy.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.371
And good.

35:30.374 --> 35:32.873
And I knew the marriage wasn't good.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.166
Few days later, when we
were alone in the house,

35:38.167 --> 35:41.066
it just happened.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.499
It was never illicit.

35:45.500 --> 35:49.232
The way you imagine it might
be with a married woman.

35:49.233 --> 35:52.232
It just felt comfortable.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.071
She never wore...

35:55.074 --> 35:57.264
Supposed to turn your phone
off during therapy, right?

35:57.267 --> 35:58.766
Hey, keep going. You're doing good.

35:58.769 --> 36:00.868
You're doing really good.

36:04.173 --> 36:08.572
I don't know where I
thought it would go.

36:08.575 --> 36:10.264
Now...

36:10.267 --> 36:13.832
Now she's raising our son.

36:13.833 --> 36:16.066
And I don't know him.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.532
He'll go his whole life

36:18.533 --> 36:20.832
without knowing who I am.

36:23.733 --> 36:26.399
I wanna be his father.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.732
I want to teach him the
things my dad taught me.

36:30.733 --> 36:35.899
But now someone else will
teach him different things.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.766
I think of you that way, Jill.

36:42.767 --> 36:46.766
I think of you as someone
to be a parent with.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.767
But I'm afraid that's not what you want.

36:51.733 --> 36:54.866
I'm afraid you'll sabotage it.

36:59.167 --> 37:01.797
You draw a border around yourself.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.183
I'm worried there's no
room to include anyone else.

37:05.186 --> 37:08.049
Even a child.

37:13.623 --> 37:17.190
I'm afraid that, deep down...

37:19.819 --> 37:22.185
you're like your dad.

37:30.133 --> 37:33.368
I guess that makes two of us.

37:46.293 --> 37:47.577
Don't stop now.

37:47.580 --> 37:48.961
This is good, we're almost there.

37:48.964 --> 37:50.897
Keep going.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.965
Tom...

37:55.333 --> 37:57.599
You're fucked up.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.741
I love you.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.845
No, w... wait.

38:07.848 --> 38:09.566
Wait.

38:09.567 --> 38:11.166
Tom.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.632
Tom!

38:13.633 --> 38:16.732
I'm sorry, he gave up.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.899
He shouldn't have. We were really close.

38:31.533 --> 38:33.099
Hello? Who is this?

38:33.100 --> 38:34.832
Jill... I...

38:34.833 --> 38:36.666
- I needed to talk to you.
- Hello?

38:36.667 --> 38:38.132
Jill, it's me. Dad.

38:38.133 --> 38:39.899
Not over the phone.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.232
I need to see you right away.

38:42.233 --> 38:44.799
Jill? Jill, are you there?

38:46.667 --> 38:49.599
Who is it?

38:49.600 --> 38:51.632
It was my dad.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.732
Your dad?

39:03.431 --> 39:05.397
What did he want?

39:05.400 --> 39:07.699
I don't know.

39:26.133 --> 39:27.932
Jillian...

39:29.800 --> 39:31.966
Stay calm.

39:31.967 --> 39:35.799
If you're calm, he's calm.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.266
Focus.

39:38.267 --> 39:40.399
Deep breaths.

41:11.667 --> 41:14.699
Tom?

41:14.700 --> 41:16.232
Tom.

41:16.233 --> 41:18.899
Tom, it's me. Open the door.

41:18.900 --> 41:22.466
Tom.

41:22.467 --> 41:24.466
Hello?
