WEBVTT

00:03.540 --> 00:04.676
David.

00:04.710 --> 00:06.647
Oh, Michael.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.150
Are we all set?

00:08.184 --> 00:11.491
Isn't...
our interview tomorrow?

00:13.660 --> 00:14.562
Yes.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.069
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood,

00:17.103 --> 00:18.771
thought I'd drop in,
say hello.

00:18.804 --> 00:20.275
Just happened to be
in Midtown Manhattan?

00:20.308 --> 00:23.115
Thought I'd catch
a show.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.682
Middle of a work day?

00:24.717 --> 00:26.453
No.

00:26.486 --> 00:28.524
You know what?

00:28.558 --> 00:31.131
Since I'm here,
let me ask you a few questions

00:31.164 --> 00:33.168
about the job.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.137
Okay.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.174
Um, how many people
are you interviewing?

00:36.207 --> 00:37.875
We're only interviewing
branch managers

00:37.908 --> 00:39.647
and some lower level
company people.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.784
Ah, well. Good.

00:41.816 --> 00:43.554
Out of curiosity,
are you interviewing anyone

00:43.588 --> 00:45.391
who's been here
longer than I have,

00:45.424 --> 00:47.229
or manages more people?

00:47.263 --> 00:49.167
I don't think so.
Great.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.137
One more question.

00:51.171 --> 00:54.177
When you merged those branches,
who did you put in charge?

00:54.210 --> 00:56.747
I believe we put you
in charge.

00:56.781 --> 00:58.651
Ah, great.
No further questions.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.121
Okay, Michael.
Okay.

01:00.121 --> 01:01.924
I'm really looking forward
to our interview.

01:01.957 --> 01:04.263
And I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.743
I have got it made
in the shade.

01:11.776 --> 01:12.745
I know this company.

01:12.778 --> 01:15.485
The other branch managers
are total morons.

01:15.519 --> 01:16.654
Hey, Pam, yeah.

01:16.687 --> 01:17.555
I forgot what day
the interview was,

01:17.588 --> 01:19.227
and I drove
to New York accidentally.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.962
Be, like, three hours late.

01:20.994 --> 01:23.968
[cheerful music]

01:24.000 --> 01:31.717
*

01:42.806 --> 01:44.877
(Pam)
See, I have 600.

01:44.910 --> 01:46.546
Yeah, I don't have--

01:46.580 --> 01:47.916
(Kevin)
Hey.

01:47.948 --> 01:49.253
Hey, Kev.

01:49.287 --> 01:51.924
What's different
about you?

01:51.956 --> 01:52.958
You look worse.

01:52.993 --> 01:53.960
Thank you.

01:53.995 --> 01:54.962
He got a haircut.

01:54.997 --> 01:56.666
That's sexy.
Hot.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.702
Oh.

01:57.736 --> 01:58.838
(Meredith)
Turn around.

01:58.871 --> 01:59.840
No.
C'mon.

01:59.873 --> 02:00.241
No, thanks.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.579
Do it!

02:02.613 --> 02:03.948
(Andy)
Lull-up do!

02:03.981 --> 02:06.353
What's up, Big Haircut?

02:06.387 --> 02:08.290
You are no longer
Big Tuna.

02:08.325 --> 02:10.562
From henceforth, you shall
be known as Big Haircut.

02:10.595 --> 02:11.564
Andy, just--

02:11.597 --> 02:12.999
Big Haircut?
Nothing.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.402
Sorry, can't hear you,
Big Haircut.

02:14.436 --> 02:15.238
Yup.
What.

02:15.271 --> 02:18.042
Karen suggested
that I get a haircut

02:18.076 --> 02:20.548
for the interview tomorrow.

02:20.582 --> 02:22.552
So that I could look
presentable.

02:22.586 --> 02:25.724
And not, as she
so lovingly puts it,

02:25.758 --> 02:27.529
homeless.

02:27.562 --> 02:28.831
Hey.

02:28.865 --> 02:29.967
I think it looks great.

02:29.999 --> 02:32.037
Thanks, Pam.

02:35.479 --> 02:37.949
After I had my little outburst
at the beach,

02:37.983 --> 02:39.953
Jim was really nice
about it.

02:39.987 --> 02:40.989
He just basically said

02:41.022 --> 02:43.828
that he missed
my friendship too,

02:43.861 --> 02:45.465
and I would always mean
a lot to him.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.503
And I understand
where he's coming from.

02:47.536 --> 02:50.774
For the record,
I am not embarrassed at all.

02:50.808 --> 02:53.078
It needed to be said,
and I said it.

02:53.113 --> 02:55.519
And it only took me
three years

02:55.552 --> 02:57.688
to summon the courage,
so...

02:57.722 --> 02:59.826
[whispering]
Thank you.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.563
[knocking]
Yeah?

03:01.597 --> 03:02.765
You wanted to see me?

03:02.798 --> 03:04.134
Yes.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.540
The time has come
to name my own replacement.

03:06.574 --> 03:10.012
So please hand this letter
of congratulations

03:10.046 --> 03:12.886
to Dwight K. Schrute.

03:14.656 --> 03:17.127
But that's my name.

03:22.205 --> 03:25.143
"Dwight, congratulations,
a-wipe.

03:25.176 --> 03:28.083
Don't screw the pooch."

03:30.052 --> 03:32.526
[crying]

03:32.559 --> 03:34.228
[sighing]
Oh.

03:34.261 --> 03:35.599
[whispering]
Thank you.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.735
Okay.

03:37.768 --> 03:40.172
[crying]

03:40.207 --> 03:41.174
All right.

03:41.209 --> 03:42.176
Thank you, Michael.

03:42.211 --> 03:44.215
Okay.

03:47.788 --> 03:49.627
Thank you so much.
Please.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.629
[sobbing]

03:50.662 --> 03:51.597
Stop crying.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.932
[crying]
Thank you.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.637
[groaning]

04:00.481 --> 04:02.251
Hey.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.188
Hey.

04:04.221 --> 04:07.529
Um, about the beach.

04:07.563 --> 04:10.032
It's okay, we all say things
without thinking.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.636
Oh, no, it's not that.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.908
I've actually been thinking that
for a long time.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.311
And I'm glad I said it.

04:15.344 --> 04:18.083
I just, I'm sorry
if it made you feel weird.

04:18.116 --> 04:21.289
Oh.

04:21.323 --> 04:23.026
Okay.

04:23.059 --> 04:27.101
Pam is kind of a bitch.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.737
Hey.

04:28.771 --> 04:30.239
What if we leave tonight?

04:30.274 --> 04:32.746
Grab a bite,
get a hotel room.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.348
Enjoy the city
a little bit.

04:34.381 --> 04:37.087
Uh...

04:37.121 --> 04:39.792
I just have
so much paperwork to do.

04:39.827 --> 04:43.032
[sighs]

04:43.066 --> 04:44.301
Wow, done.

04:44.336 --> 04:47.141
Okay, let's do it.

04:47.174 --> 04:48.845
So I was wondering if Karen
and I could get off

04:48.877 --> 04:50.213
a few hours early,
'cause we wanted

04:50.247 --> 04:51.215
to spend the night
in the city.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.153
Why, so you can do it?

04:53.186 --> 04:54.188
Whoops.

04:54.221 --> 04:55.290
No, um...

04:55.323 --> 04:56.826
Well, I was thinking
that, uh,

04:56.861 --> 04:58.765
actually, we could
all leave tomorrow.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.233
And do a convoy.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.771
You know?
Oh.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.907
Convoys are really fun.

05:03.941 --> 05:05.209
Pull up next to each other.

05:05.243 --> 05:07.014
Give each other the finger.

05:07.046 --> 05:08.116
Mm.

05:08.149 --> 05:09.719
Moon each other.

05:09.752 --> 05:11.089
Uh, we're gonna go
tonight.

05:11.122 --> 05:12.256
But we're gonna see you there
tomorrow morning, right?

05:12.290 --> 05:13.326
All right.
All right.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.896
Your loss.
Wait.

05:14.930 --> 05:16.833
Um, how would you moon us
if you were driving?

05:16.867 --> 05:17.968
Cruise control.

05:18.003 --> 05:19.171
Oh.

05:19.205 --> 05:22.144
So Jim, who do you think
is hotter,

05:22.177 --> 05:24.148
Pam or Karen?

05:24.181 --> 05:26.051
Yeah, I'm not gonna talk
about this now.

05:26.084 --> 05:27.154
Pam is taller.

05:27.187 --> 05:28.189
You sure?

05:28.223 --> 05:30.729
Yes.

05:30.762 --> 05:32.866
She has bigger breasts too.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.000
Wow.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.438
But I think Karen
has a prettier face.

05:35.470 --> 05:37.307
Mm-hmm.

05:37.342 --> 05:39.144
Mm-hmm.

05:39.178 --> 05:41.081
What else?

05:41.114 --> 05:44.823
Well, I mean, Pam's face
is really pretty too.

05:44.857 --> 05:46.259
It's a very tough call.

05:46.292 --> 05:47.494
Mm.

05:47.527 --> 05:48.765
Really tough call.

05:48.798 --> 05:49.932
Yeah.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.502
You know what,
why don't you take

05:51.535 --> 05:53.239
the rest of the day,
figure it out,

05:53.273 --> 05:55.979
and then come back
and tell me what you got?

05:56.011 --> 05:58.249
Will do.

05:58.283 --> 06:00.220
All right.

06:00.253 --> 06:02.926
(Kevin)
Yes.

06:02.959 --> 06:05.063
Hey, Pam.

06:05.097 --> 06:07.001
I've been meaning
to say something to you.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.904
I really miss
our friendship.

06:08.937 --> 06:10.107
[laughter]

06:10.140 --> 06:11.977
Ha ha, that's very funny.

06:12.010 --> 06:14.014
I've never heard you
talk that much.

06:14.048 --> 06:15.282
I thought it was Kelly.

06:15.317 --> 06:17.387
Are you kidding?
I would never have done that.

06:17.422 --> 06:18.222
It was patheticville.

06:18.256 --> 06:19.224
No offense, Pam.

06:19.258 --> 06:20.226
(Meredith)
You know what?

06:20.260 --> 06:21.864
Don't even worry about it.

06:21.896 --> 06:22.765
Everyone was so drunk,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.502
I bet no one even remembers
what you said.

06:24.535 --> 06:25.504
I remember.

06:25.537 --> 06:27.240
I blogged the whole thing.

06:27.274 --> 06:31.450
www.creedthoughts.gov.
www\creedthoughts.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.057
Check it out.

06:35.089 --> 06:38.063
Last year, Creed asked me
how to set up a blog.

06:38.095 --> 06:42.304
Wanting to protect the world
from being exposed

06:42.337 --> 06:45.610
to Creed's brain,
I opened up a Word document

06:45.643 --> 06:48.885
on his computer,
and put an address at the top.

06:48.918 --> 06:51.188
I've read some of it.

06:51.221 --> 06:52.391
Even for the internet,

06:52.425 --> 06:56.231
it's...
pretty shocking.

06:56.264 --> 06:57.266
There they are.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.437
The accounting department.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.441
I shall miss your humility

07:00.474 --> 07:02.411
and your
promptly-printed checks.

07:02.445 --> 07:03.547
Do you think
it's gonna be weird?

07:03.580 --> 07:05.985
Working with Jan
in New York?

07:06.018 --> 07:06.887
No, not at all.

07:06.921 --> 07:08.957
I haven't talked to Jan
since we broke up.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.462
And I think if she had
something to say,

07:11.495 --> 07:12.631
she would've called me.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.235
Maybe you
should talk to her--

07:14.268 --> 07:15.237
No, no, no, no.

07:15.270 --> 07:16.239
You know what?

07:16.272 --> 07:17.306
It's a done deal.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.277
I basically have the job
already.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.382
There's nothing she can do
to stop it now.

07:21.415 --> 07:22.417
I already sold my condo.

07:22.452 --> 07:23.519
Michael.

07:23.554 --> 07:24.990
What?
Why?

07:25.022 --> 07:26.460
I'm sorry,
that just doesn't make sense.

07:26.493 --> 07:27.462
Yes.
W-why?

07:27.495 --> 07:28.564
Who gave you
that advice?

07:28.596 --> 07:31.101
Yeah, Michael, you should never
sell your condo--

07:31.135 --> 07:32.370
I have to buy another place.

07:32.404 --> 07:33.272
But you said you were
in debt.

07:33.305 --> 07:35.110
You're not sure
that you have the job.

07:35.142 --> 07:37.181
I sold it on eBay.

07:37.213 --> 07:39.953
The buyer was very motivated,
as was I.

07:39.987 --> 07:42.457
It went for 80%
of what I paid.

07:42.492 --> 07:44.963
Sold in record time.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.398
How would you like to spend
the night

07:46.432 --> 07:49.606
with the regional manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton?

07:49.639 --> 07:52.276
No, Dwight, I don't care
if that's how

07:52.310 --> 07:54.380
they consolidated power
in ancient Rome.

07:54.414 --> 07:56.251
No, no.
Not--not Michael.

07:56.284 --> 07:58.056
Me.

07:58.089 --> 08:00.760
I'm taking his job.

08:00.793 --> 08:03.166
Not now.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.402
[deep breath]

08:08.442 --> 08:10.447
Good-bye, Kelly Kapur.

08:14.254 --> 08:16.592
Jim, Jim, Jim.

08:16.625 --> 08:20.734
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim,
Jim, Jim, Jim.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.373
Oh.
Hey, Dwight.

08:23.405 --> 08:26.245
I'm going to be
your new boss.

08:26.278 --> 08:27.346
[laughs]

08:27.381 --> 08:29.718
It's my greatest dream
come true.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.623
Welcome to the Hotel Hell.

08:31.655 --> 08:34.828
Check-in time is now,
check-out time is never.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.299
Does my room have cable?

08:36.331 --> 08:37.301
No.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.572
And the sheets are made
of fire.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.840
Can I change rooms?

08:40.873 --> 08:42.645
Sorry, we're all booked up.

08:42.678 --> 08:44.616
Hell convention in town.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.351
Can I have
a late checkout?

08:46.384 --> 08:47.854
We'll have to talk
to the manager.

08:47.887 --> 08:49.626
You're not the manager?

08:49.659 --> 08:51.229
Even in your own fantasy?

08:51.262 --> 08:53.799
I'm the owner.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.537
The co-owner.

08:55.571 --> 08:57.107
With Satan.

08:57.141 --> 08:59.679
Okay,
just so I understand it.

08:59.712 --> 09:03.587
In your wildest fantasy,
you are in hell.

09:03.619 --> 09:06.692
And you are co-running
a bed and breakfast

09:06.726 --> 09:08.129
with the devil.

09:08.163 --> 09:10.668
Yeah, but I haven't told you
my salary yet.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.635
Go.

09:11.670 --> 09:15.276
$80,000 a year.

09:15.309 --> 09:16.479
Once I am officially
regional manager,

09:16.512 --> 09:20.187
my first order of business
will be to demote Jim Halpert.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.591
So I will need
a new number two.

09:22.625 --> 09:25.430
My ideal choice?

09:25.462 --> 09:27.333
Jack Bauer.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.470
But he is unavailable.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.175
Fictional.

09:31.209 --> 09:33.179
And overqualified.

09:33.213 --> 09:36.853
I will see you...

09:36.885 --> 09:39.826
at the interview.

09:39.859 --> 09:42.932
Yes, you will.

09:42.964 --> 09:44.769
Who is D. Abramson?

09:44.802 --> 09:46.504
Um, he's from that company
in Pittsburgh.

09:46.538 --> 09:47.506
Michael.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.879
Why?

09:49.911 --> 09:51.883
Are you here?

09:51.915 --> 09:55.758
Uh, how are you?

09:55.791 --> 09:56.760
I'm good.

09:56.793 --> 09:57.895
How are you, Janet?

09:57.927 --> 09:58.897
It's good to see you.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.633
I'm great.

10:04.474 --> 10:08.014
Uh, can we...
can we talk privately

10:08.048 --> 10:09.619
for a minute?

10:09.651 --> 10:11.522
Why privately?

10:11.555 --> 10:15.763
Uh, I just...
I, uh, I don't, uh.

10:15.798 --> 10:18.035
I-I don't like the way
that we left things.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.372
Okay, sure.
Fine.

10:20.407 --> 10:21.810
Um, why don't you wait
in my office?

10:21.843 --> 10:23.646
I have some important
business matters

10:23.679 --> 10:26.352
to take care of.

10:26.384 --> 10:27.621
Okay.

10:27.654 --> 10:29.558
Okay.

10:31.093 --> 10:35.838
Pam, DEFCON 10,
Houston, we have a problem.

10:35.871 --> 10:37.875
What do you want me
to do?

10:37.908 --> 10:40.747
Uh, I may need
some immediate assistance.

10:40.781 --> 10:43.787
If you would slowly and quietly
gather the ladies

10:43.820 --> 10:44.889
in the conference room.

10:44.922 --> 10:46.325
Phyllis, Angela, Karen.

10:46.359 --> 10:47.661
What about Meredith?

10:47.694 --> 10:48.930
No.

10:48.964 --> 10:50.968
She's an alternate.

10:51.001 --> 10:52.771
So how you been?

10:52.805 --> 10:53.807
I've been good.
Good.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.710
Good. Yeah.

10:55.743 --> 10:56.779
Oh.

10:56.813 --> 10:57.915
Sorry to drop by
unexpectedly.

10:57.948 --> 11:01.321
I, uh, tried calling,
but I kept getting voicemail.

11:01.321 --> 11:02.825
Weird, yeah.

11:02.857 --> 11:04.929
I didn't get
both of your messages.

11:04.962 --> 11:06.900
Ah.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.775
So, uh, Michael needs us
in the conference room.

11:11.810 --> 11:12.777
Oh, is it Jan again?

11:12.812 --> 11:15.482
Hey, uh,
before I leave tonight,

11:15.516 --> 11:17.722
would you mind making
a half a dozen copies

11:17.754 --> 11:18.890
of Jim's and my sales reports

11:18.924 --> 11:19.892
for our interviews
tomorrow?

11:19.926 --> 11:20.894
Uh, sure.

11:20.928 --> 11:22.062
Thanks.

11:22.096 --> 11:24.468
I really hope
you get the job.

11:24.500 --> 11:28.910
Thanks.

11:28.944 --> 11:31.648
After you ended everything
with us,

11:31.682 --> 11:32.952
I went on a vacation.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.788
Mm.

11:34.821 --> 11:35.991
To kind of clear
my mind.

11:36.024 --> 11:37.461
Sounds good,
sounds fun.

11:37.494 --> 11:39.999
It was,
yeah, it was good.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.070
[laughing]
I think I should just...

11:42.103 --> 11:44.007
get right to the point,
you know?

11:44.040 --> 11:47.948
Um, I-I feel good
about myself

11:47.982 --> 11:51.722
for the first time
in a really long time.

11:51.755 --> 11:53.994
And I've made
some big changes

11:54.027 --> 11:56.799
in my life,
and...

11:56.832 --> 11:59.004
I miss you.

12:01.108 --> 12:03.078
I want us
to get back together.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.224
Would you excuse me
for a second?

12:09.256 --> 12:11.995
Oh, okay.

12:12.030 --> 12:15.938
DEFCON 20.

12:15.971 --> 12:16.873
She wants to get
back together.

12:16.905 --> 12:18.042
What are you
gonna do?

12:18.075 --> 12:19.945
I don't know.
That's why you're here.

12:19.979 --> 12:20.947
Help me, please.

12:20.981 --> 12:21.983
Would you wanna get
back together with her?

12:22.016 --> 12:23.787
No! No.

12:23.819 --> 12:25.022
What do I do?

12:25.056 --> 12:26.925
Just don't get
back together with her.

12:26.959 --> 12:27.927
What if she makes me?

12:27.961 --> 12:29.831
How can she make you
get back together with her?

12:29.866 --> 12:32.303
She made me do a lot of things
I didn't wanna do.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.808
This was
a terrible relationship.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.310
You were not happy
when you were with her.

12:36.343 --> 12:37.312
I wasn't.

12:37.345 --> 12:38.983
You're so much happier now.

12:39.017 --> 12:41.253
Just go in there
and be strong.

12:41.288 --> 12:42.991
You're right.

12:43.025 --> 12:44.628
You are absolutely right,
I need to go in there

12:44.661 --> 12:46.632
and tell her
that we can't be together.

12:46.665 --> 12:47.967
(Pam)
Right.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.806
Wow.
(Karen)
You can do it.

12:49.838 --> 12:51.942
I'm in a very good place
right now.

12:51.975 --> 12:52.944
Thank you.

12:52.977 --> 12:54.848
[Pam whispering]
Go. Go, go.

12:54.881 --> 12:56.685
[all sigh]

12:56.719 --> 12:57.787
Okay.

12:57.822 --> 12:58.789
[clears throat]

12:58.824 --> 13:01.561
Jan...

13:01.561 --> 13:03.999
We need to talk.

13:09.243 --> 13:11.347
(Michael)
Jan is in a different place
right now.

13:11.381 --> 13:13.653
And it is a sign
of maturity

13:13.685 --> 13:16.257
to give people
second chances.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.294
So I'm going to hear her out.

13:23.105 --> 13:26.913
Oh, my God.

13:26.945 --> 13:29.651
[mouthing]

13:29.685 --> 13:31.320
Yeah, bigger actually.

13:31.354 --> 13:32.322
[whispering]
That's crazy.

13:32.356 --> 13:33.659
(Jim)
Mm-hmm.

13:33.693 --> 13:35.028
[mouthing]

13:37.300 --> 13:39.971
Oh, my God,
can you believe that?

13:40.005 --> 13:41.174
Unbelievable.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.310
Wow.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.746
(Jim)
She could put the cup
right there.

13:43.779 --> 13:44.748
(Karen)
I know.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.251
No, it's fine.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.288
I'm sure it must've been weird
for Jim

13:48.322 --> 13:51.060
when Roy and I
were joking around.

13:51.093 --> 13:52.897
That one time.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.271
(Meredith)
I would never do that.

13:56.304 --> 13:58.208
Waste of money.

13:58.242 --> 14:01.281
In my experience,
guys are way more attracted

14:01.314 --> 14:03.786
to the back of you
than to the front.

14:03.819 --> 14:05.322
I love fake boobs.

14:05.355 --> 14:08.395
Oftentimes you find them
on strippers.

14:08.427 --> 14:09.397
I find it offensive.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.300
Au naturel, baby.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.402
That's how I like 'em.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.442
Swing low, sweet chariots.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.213
So...

14:17.245 --> 14:19.017
There are a lot of things
I would like to do differently.

14:19.049 --> 14:19.886
Yeah.

14:19.918 --> 14:22.023
I feel like
when we first got together,

14:22.055 --> 14:23.993
that I had a problem
with my priorities.

14:24.027 --> 14:25.296
First got priorities.

14:25.329 --> 14:28.235
And if we could talk
about a way to approach

14:28.268 --> 14:29.436
a possible reconciliation.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.140
Let's get back together.

14:31.173 --> 14:33.412
[laughs]

14:33.444 --> 14:34.848
No. No, no, no.

14:34.882 --> 14:35.918
I'll tell you this,

14:35.951 --> 14:37.854
it is not
because of the boob job.

14:37.888 --> 14:39.991
Excuse me,
boob enhancement.

14:40.026 --> 14:41.193
That would be shallow.

14:41.227 --> 14:43.231
And this is the opposite
of shallow.

14:43.265 --> 14:46.570
This is emotionally magnificent.

14:46.603 --> 14:48.207
Okay, everyone, listen up!

14:48.241 --> 14:51.314
Time to begin
the interview process!

14:53.217 --> 14:55.088
Andrew Bernard.

14:55.121 --> 14:56.993
Saving the best
for first.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.562
All right, you guys,
see you later.

14:58.594 --> 14:59.966
Wish us luck.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.401
No! Hey, hey, hey,
do not wish them luck.

15:01.434 --> 15:01.801
Do not wish them luck.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.374
All luck must be wished
unto Michael.

15:04.407 --> 15:06.211
(everyone)
Good luck, you guys.

15:06.243 --> 15:07.479
What did I say?

15:07.513 --> 15:08.481
Good luck.

15:08.515 --> 15:10.386
Thanks.

15:13.392 --> 15:15.196
(Pam)
I'm happy for him.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.864
I hope he gets the job.

15:16.899 --> 15:19.004
I really just want him
to be happy.

15:19.036 --> 15:20.471
And I know that sounds cliché.

15:20.506 --> 15:25.315
And I know saying
it sounds cliché sounds cliché.

15:25.349 --> 15:27.987
Maybe I'm being cliché,
I don't care.

15:28.022 --> 15:31.560
'Cause I am what I am.

15:31.594 --> 15:34.099
That's Popeye.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.668
I am going to begin
this process

15:35.701 --> 15:37.506
with a simple test
of intelligence

15:37.540 --> 15:40.512
and mental dexterity.

15:40.546 --> 15:41.514
What is the best color?

15:41.548 --> 15:45.422
White, because it contains
all other colors.

15:45.456 --> 15:47.526
Wrong, black.
It is the most dominant.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.030
How do you make a table?

15:49.064 --> 15:52.403
You make a chair,
but you don't sit on it.

15:52.436 --> 15:53.371
What is the capital
of Maine?

15:53.405 --> 15:56.377
The capital of Maine
is Montpelier, Vermont.

15:56.411 --> 15:58.515
Which is near Ithaca, New York,

15:58.548 --> 15:59.716
where I went to Cornell.

15:59.749 --> 16:01.921
Okay, also, moratorium
on Cornell talk.

16:01.921 --> 16:04.027
Don't wanna hear about it.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.328
Forget your personal history,

16:05.361 --> 16:06.730
and learn the history
of this company.

16:06.764 --> 16:07.732
Should not be a problem.

16:07.766 --> 16:08.667
I minored in history

16:08.702 --> 16:11.008
in the ivy league school
which I attended.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.278
You're not off
to a very good start, Bernard.

16:13.312 --> 16:15.182
I agree.

16:15.215 --> 16:17.552
But in another way,

16:17.585 --> 16:21.093
I am off to a very good start,
wouldn't you say?

16:21.128 --> 16:23.431
I am a great interviewee.

16:23.465 --> 16:26.437
Why? Because I have something
no one else has.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.607
My brain.

16:28.642 --> 16:33.417
Which I use to my advantage,
when advantageous.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.591
[grunting]

16:36.624 --> 16:38.427
Time!
Nope, you failed.

16:38.461 --> 16:39.729
Damn it!

16:39.764 --> 16:44.040
This interview is over,
I'll let you know.

16:44.074 --> 16:46.410
Hey, thank you so much
for driving me down

16:46.443 --> 16:47.412
for my interview.

16:47.445 --> 16:48.682
Totally. No problem.

16:48.715 --> 16:50.786
What are you interviewing for,
by the way?

16:50.818 --> 16:52.455
My assistant, or...

16:52.489 --> 16:53.625
Oh, you know, I'm gonna have

16:53.658 --> 16:56.463
a "Congratulations, Karen"
party, um,

16:56.497 --> 16:57.700
tomorrow night
at my friend's house.

16:57.733 --> 16:59.769
Oh, wow, that sounds fun.
Yeah.

16:59.804 --> 17:01.808
Is your friend
named Karen too?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.412
What did she accomplish?

17:03.444 --> 17:05.616
No, I'm sorry.
I should've been clearer.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.650
Uh-huh.
It's for me.

17:06.684 --> 17:08.588
Oh.
'Cause I'm gonna get the job.

17:10.526 --> 17:12.463
How remarkable.

17:12.495 --> 17:14.266
Thanks.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.503
[both exhale loudly]

17:16.538 --> 17:18.541
Wait, let me just
check one more thing.

17:18.575 --> 17:21.780
Okay.

17:21.814 --> 17:23.618
Very good.

17:28.561 --> 17:31.634
All right, well,
I have to get back.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.504
But I will see you
in New York tomorrow, right?

17:33.537 --> 17:34.506
Yes, indeed.

17:34.539 --> 17:35.676
Good luck
with your interview.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.382
Thank you.

17:38.414 --> 17:39.617
[Jan whispering]
Bye.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.465
So I...

17:47.499 --> 17:48.902
guess we're getting
back together.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.339
What happened?

17:50.371 --> 17:51.873
Your advice was good,

17:51.908 --> 17:54.479
but Jan's was bigger.

17:54.513 --> 17:55.948
(Michael)
Here's the sitch.

17:55.981 --> 17:59.556
Two weeks ago, I was
in the worst relationship

17:59.589 --> 18:00.558
of my life.

18:00.591 --> 18:02.162
She treated me poorly.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.632
We didn't connect.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.933
I was miserable.

18:04.966 --> 18:09.510
Now I'm in the best relationship
of my life

18:09.544 --> 18:12.449
with the same woman.

18:12.483 --> 18:15.556
Love is a mystery.

18:15.589 --> 18:18.428
So we have all night,
where do you wanna go first?

18:18.461 --> 18:19.697
I don't know.

18:19.730 --> 18:20.598
How 'bout the U.N.?

18:20.631 --> 18:22.803
How often do you
come here?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.707
Mm, every time
my sixth grade class

18:24.740 --> 18:25.709
goes on a field trip.

18:25.742 --> 18:26.543
Well, I think you're

18:26.578 --> 18:29.549
really going to enjoy this,
Adult Jim.

18:34.827 --> 18:38.032
Hey, everybody.

18:38.065 --> 18:39.770
The next time you see me,
I will be working

18:39.804 --> 18:41.607
for corporate.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.611
Starting tomorrow,
Dwight Schrute

18:43.644 --> 18:46.918
will be running the branch.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.623
So without further ado...

18:49.656 --> 18:51.794
[Natalie Merchant's
Kind and Generous on recorder]

18:51.828 --> 18:53.798
I would like to start saying
my good-byes.

18:53.832 --> 18:58.574
* For everything you've done

18:58.607 --> 19:01.513
* You know I'm bound

19:01.548 --> 19:02.282
Okay.

19:02.282 --> 19:05.489
* I'm bound to thank you
for it *

19:05.522 --> 19:07.592
* Na na na na na na na

19:07.626 --> 19:09.963
Good night.

19:09.997 --> 19:11.768
And good luck.

19:11.801 --> 19:13.737
* Na na na

19:13.772 --> 19:16.378
* Na na na na na na

19:16.410 --> 19:18.548
* Na na na na na na na

19:18.581 --> 19:19.649
[music stops]

19:23.858 --> 19:25.929
Who's ready to work?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.872
Yeah, we went
to The Spotted Pig

19:30.906 --> 19:32.542
for dinner,
it's in the Village.

19:32.576 --> 19:33.777
Uh, Karen knew it.

19:33.811 --> 19:36.618
And then we second-acted
Spamalot.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.152
That's when you sneak in
at intermission

19:38.186 --> 19:39.288
with all the smokers.

19:39.322 --> 19:43.130
And then we went to a bar
that used to be a church.

19:43.162 --> 19:46.404
Oh, and at this one bar,
I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.

19:46.438 --> 19:48.741
That wasn't him.

19:48.774 --> 19:50.044
[mouthing]

19:50.077 --> 19:51.046
So what's gonna happen
with us

19:51.079 --> 19:52.815
when I get this job?

19:52.849 --> 19:54.487
Oh, do you mean
when I get the job?

19:54.520 --> 19:57.725
Well, if you get the job...

19:57.759 --> 20:00.631
then I'd move here
with you.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.402
Would you move with me?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.774
I'm not stupid, okay?

20:04.806 --> 20:06.811
I was at the beach.

20:06.843 --> 20:08.948
We don't have a future
in Scranton.

20:08.982 --> 20:12.087
There's
one too many people there.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.593
You mean Kevin?

20:14.626 --> 20:15.829
Exactly.

20:15.861 --> 20:17.833
[laughs]

20:17.865 --> 20:20.739
No, but you get it,
right?

20:20.771 --> 20:22.709
We can't stay there.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.846
Yeah.

20:24.879 --> 20:26.951
I do.

20:26.984 --> 20:28.988
Come on.

20:39.677 --> 20:41.581
[exhales loudly]

20:41.614 --> 20:43.752
How are you guys doing?
Need anything?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.721
Uh, no, we're good.
Thanks.

20:45.756 --> 20:47.526
I have been here
a bunch of times,

20:47.560 --> 20:48.827
so I know where
everything is.

20:48.861 --> 20:50.197
Know everybody's names.

20:50.229 --> 20:51.867
If you need to know
somebody's name, just ask me.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.574
[door opens]

20:54.607 --> 20:56.810
Who's that?

20:56.843 --> 20:58.648
That is Beardy.

20:58.682 --> 20:59.684
Beardy?

20:59.717 --> 21:00.719
Mm-hmm.

21:00.751 --> 21:01.987
Why don't I introduce
myself.

21:02.021 --> 21:02.522
No, no, no--just--
that's not his real name.

21:02.522 --> 21:05.862
That's just
what I call him, so.

21:05.896 --> 21:07.632
I am by far
the most qualified person

21:07.666 --> 21:08.868
they're interviewing.

21:08.902 --> 21:10.671
Jim and Karen are here.

21:10.705 --> 21:11.707
Which is cute.

21:11.740 --> 21:15.114
They're like kid actors
tagging along with Daddy

21:15.146 --> 21:16.618
on the big audition.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.354
Hoping to be discovered.

21:18.387 --> 21:22.061
Except Daddy
is the best actor around.

21:22.094 --> 21:25.636
Daddy is Meryl Streep.

21:25.669 --> 21:27.772
Michael is gone.

21:27.806 --> 21:32.315
Hail to the Chief!

21:32.348 --> 21:33.784
My first order of business,

21:33.818 --> 21:36.957
make Andrew Bernard
my number two.

21:36.990 --> 21:39.764
My first order of business,
accept.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.332
As if you had
a choice.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.170
Duh.

21:43.203 --> 21:45.308
Opportunity of a lifetime.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.744
[spits]

21:46.778 --> 21:49.916
Three months ago,
I was nowhere.

21:49.949 --> 21:53.423
I was just a Cornell grad
in anger management.

21:53.456 --> 21:54.993
Look where I am now.

21:55.026 --> 21:57.865
Not bad.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.737
[laughs]

22:01.439 --> 22:02.642
Hey, Hunter!

22:02.642 --> 22:04.813
[accented]
What's up, my brother?

22:04.847 --> 22:07.686
This is Hunter,
secretary extraordinaire.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.724
Uh, administrative assistant.

22:09.756 --> 22:11.091
Is Jan in yet?

22:11.126 --> 22:12.260
I think she's
coming in later.

22:12.293 --> 22:13.262
Could you give her
a message for me

22:13.295 --> 22:14.264
when she gets in?

22:14.297 --> 22:16.101
Sure.

22:16.136 --> 22:20.309
Just say
"I want to squeeze them."

22:20.345 --> 22:22.750
It's code,
she'll know what it means.

22:22.783 --> 22:24.452
Okay.

22:24.486 --> 22:25.454
Oh, and Hunter?

22:25.488 --> 22:27.793
Could you tell her
"Brr," also?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.270
You showed
great leadership potential

22:33.303 --> 22:34.305
at the coal walk.

22:34.337 --> 22:35.742
Even if you did follow it

22:35.776 --> 22:37.880
with that embarrassing
personal confession.

22:37.913 --> 22:39.750
Thank you.

22:39.784 --> 22:41.487
I had to make Andy
my number two.

22:41.519 --> 22:43.356
It's political,
complicated.

22:43.391 --> 22:44.325
You wouldn't understand.

22:44.358 --> 22:48.734
I want you to be
assistant regional manager.

22:49.503 --> 22:50.772
Really?

22:50.806 --> 22:52.776
Well, in a sense.

22:52.810 --> 22:54.345
Although publicly,
I am going to retain

22:54.379 --> 22:57.284
the assistant regional manager
position.

22:57.318 --> 22:58.454
You will be
your own assistant.

22:58.486 --> 23:00.490
Correct, I need someone
I can trust.

23:00.525 --> 23:02.762
But I would also like
the title

23:02.762 --> 23:05.199
to be secretly applied to you.

23:05.234 --> 23:09.342
Just stripped
of its pomp and frills.

23:09.374 --> 23:11.813
Okay.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.588
So you would be
the regional manager

23:15.621 --> 23:18.527
and the assistant
regional manager.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.564
Andy is your number two.

23:20.598 --> 23:24.473
I would be the secret
assistant regional manager.

23:24.505 --> 23:25.440
Mm, let's call it
secret assistant

23:25.475 --> 23:27.277
to the regional manager.

23:27.311 --> 23:28.513
Mm-hmm.

23:28.547 --> 23:29.984
Do you accept?

23:30.016 --> 23:32.555
Absolutely, I do.

23:32.588 --> 23:34.125
I learned from Jim,

23:34.157 --> 23:36.629
if Dwight ever asks you
if you accept something secret,

23:36.662 --> 23:40.872
you reply,
"Absolutely, I do."

23:44.947 --> 23:46.281
Hello, hello!

23:46.315 --> 23:48.120
Michael, good to see you.

23:48.152 --> 23:49.489
Good to see you.
Have a seat.

23:49.523 --> 23:51.258
Here are the post-merger
performance stats

23:51.291 --> 23:52.661
that you asked for.
Great.

23:52.694 --> 23:54.533
I've been meaning to thank you,
by the way.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.637
You didn't lose
a single customer in the merger,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.406
and you still managed
to trim the budget.

23:58.441 --> 24:01.278
That is nice work.

24:01.311 --> 24:04.519
So let me ask you a question
right off the bat.

24:04.553 --> 24:06.188
What do you think
are your greatest strengths

24:06.222 --> 24:07.525
as a manager?

24:07.558 --> 24:10.329
Why don't I tell you
what my greatest weaknesses are?

24:10.363 --> 24:12.234
I work too hard.

24:12.268 --> 24:13.670
I care too much.

24:13.704 --> 24:18.045
And sometimes I can be
too invested in my job.

24:18.079 --> 24:20.183
Okay.

24:20.217 --> 24:21.720
And your strengths?

24:21.752 --> 24:25.359
Well, my weaknesses
are actually strengths.

24:25.393 --> 24:28.700
Oh! Yes. Very good.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.702
Thank you.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.039
Very good.

24:31.071 --> 24:32.340
Dwight is our new boss.

24:32.373 --> 24:34.445
Oh, Michael's
not going anywhere.

24:34.479 --> 24:36.181
Then who do you think
will get the job?

24:36.216 --> 24:37.619
Karen.

24:37.652 --> 24:39.723
She looks corporate.

24:39.755 --> 24:42.128
Those little pantsuits.

24:42.161 --> 24:43.564
I think
it's gonna be Michael.

24:43.597 --> 24:45.433
Do you really think
he's qualified for that job?

24:45.467 --> 24:48.173
No, but he wasn't qualified
for the job he has now,

24:48.205 --> 24:49.407
and he got that one.

24:49.441 --> 24:50.409
[laughing]
Yeah.

24:50.443 --> 24:51.311
Listen up!

24:51.345 --> 24:53.684
Come to the center
of the room, please.

24:53.716 --> 24:56.722
This...

24:56.757 --> 24:59.294
is a Schrute buck.

24:59.327 --> 25:00.598
When you have done
something good,

25:00.631 --> 25:04.305
you will receive
one Schrute buck.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.109
1,000 Schrute bucks
equals

25:06.142 --> 25:08.647
an extra five minutes
for lunch.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.587
What is the cash value
of a Schrute buck?

25:11.619 --> 25:13.423
Excellent question, Pam.

25:13.455 --> 25:15.260
1/100th of a cent.

25:15.293 --> 25:19.102
So 10,000 of your dollars
is worth one real dollar?

25:19.135 --> 25:20.771
Just zip your lid.

25:20.804 --> 25:22.609
Another announcement.

25:22.642 --> 25:24.745
Michael wasted
an enormous amount

25:24.779 --> 25:25.715
of the group's time
and patience

25:25.747 --> 25:28.519
with non-work-related
ethnic celebrations

25:28.554 --> 25:31.491
and parades of soft-minded
do-good-edness.

25:31.525 --> 25:32.828
No longer.

25:32.862 --> 25:35.267
No more meetings.

25:35.299 --> 25:36.468
Amen.

25:36.501 --> 25:39.407
Instead, today I will begin
my first lecture

25:39.441 --> 25:41.780
in a long series of lectures
designed to increase

25:41.812 --> 25:43.315
your knowledge
on the world of paper.

25:43.350 --> 25:44.317
Do we have to?

25:44.352 --> 25:45.820
Yes.
Michael is gone.

25:45.855 --> 25:48.761
There's a new sheriff here
in these offices.

25:48.794 --> 25:50.765
And his name is me.

25:50.798 --> 25:53.136
Conference room, ten seconds.

25:53.170 --> 25:53.970
All of you!

25:54.003 --> 25:56.242
I literally cannot wait
until I see

25:56.276 --> 25:58.380
what Dwight has planned.

25:58.412 --> 26:00.885
And I wish Jim were here.

26:00.917 --> 26:03.122
What do you think
we could be doing better?

26:03.122 --> 26:05.794
I've never been a big fan
of the name Dunder-Mifflin.

26:05.828 --> 26:07.230
I was thinking we could
name the company

26:07.264 --> 26:10.404
something like
Paper Great,

26:10.436 --> 26:12.307
where great paper
is our passion.

26:12.340 --> 26:14.678
[as Tony the Tiger]
We're grrreat!

26:14.713 --> 26:17.584
I don't know,
could be good.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.255
Or, uh, Super Duper Paper.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.658
It's super duper.

26:20.691 --> 26:22.528
I don't know,
something like that.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.332
Okay.
Okay.

26:24.364 --> 26:25.366
Thanks for coming in,
Michael.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.301
Thank you.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.774
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

26:28.806 --> 26:31.511
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.416
So--oh, before I forget.

26:33.449 --> 26:36.622
I wanted to let you know,
if you hadn't already heard,

26:36.656 --> 26:38.827
uh, Jan and I
are back together.

26:38.861 --> 26:40.364
So I may need to fill out

26:40.397 --> 26:42.433
one of those love documents
again.

26:42.468 --> 26:43.370
You're back together.

26:43.403 --> 26:45.841
Yes, and I am very excited
about the prospect

26:45.875 --> 26:46.910
of working under her.

26:46.942 --> 26:48.646
Or on top of her.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.451
Mm, that's not sexual,
just we're all professionals.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.356
Okay, well.

26:53.390 --> 26:55.427
Uh, I thought it was clear
in the description

26:55.459 --> 26:57.463
of the position.

26:57.498 --> 27:00.270
The job you're applying for
is Jan's job.

27:00.304 --> 27:01.372
I don't understand.

27:01.406 --> 27:03.242
So we're gonna tag team it?

27:03.242 --> 27:05.715
No, we're letting Jan go.

27:08.453 --> 27:12.561
Listen up.
Let's start from the ground up.

27:12.594 --> 27:14.666
Where does paper come from?

27:16.101 --> 27:17.338
(Dwight)
Trees.

27:17.370 --> 27:20.677
And where do trees grow?

27:20.710 --> 27:22.314
Forest.
Soil.

27:22.348 --> 27:23.683
Right.

27:23.716 --> 27:26.389
We have
in front of you here,

27:26.421 --> 27:30.364
seven different types
of Pennsylvania topsoil.

27:30.397 --> 27:35.908
Now, what would you say
is the most important element

27:35.941 --> 27:39.547
in the production
of aboveground leafy growth?

27:40.616 --> 27:42.889
Probably phosphorus,
right?

27:42.922 --> 27:43.891
Wrong.

27:43.924 --> 27:45.360
It's nitrogen.

27:45.394 --> 27:48.533
Absorb this information.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.871
Good.

27:50.905 --> 27:52.942
Now, let us discuss
precipitation.

27:52.975 --> 27:53.944
Stanley.

27:53.977 --> 27:55.547
When rainfall occurs,

27:55.579 --> 27:58.753
does it usually fall
in a liquid, solid,

27:58.786 --> 28:00.123
or gaseous state?

28:00.155 --> 28:02.159
Liquid.

28:02.192 --> 28:03.362
[claps]
Very good.

28:03.362 --> 28:06.167
You have earned
one Schrute buck.

28:06.201 --> 28:08.038
I don't want it.

28:08.072 --> 28:10.476
Then you have been deducted
50 Schrute bucks.

28:10.510 --> 28:11.478
Make it 100.

28:11.511 --> 28:13.751
Well...

28:13.784 --> 28:15.788
Don't you wanna earn
Schrute bucks?

28:15.820 --> 28:18.826
No--In fact,
I'll give you a billion

28:18.861 --> 28:21.566
Stanley nickels
if you never talk to me again.

28:21.598 --> 28:22.568
What's the ratio
of Stanley nickels

28:22.600 --> 28:23.669
to Schrute bucks?

28:23.704 --> 28:26.141
The same as the ratio
of unicorns to leprechauns.

28:26.174 --> 28:27.578
Okay.
That's it!

28:27.610 --> 28:28.781
Class is cancelled,
everybody out.

28:28.813 --> 28:29.949
What? No, wait!
What are you doing?

28:29.983 --> 28:31.151
I'm punishing them.
No, no, no!

28:31.184 --> 28:32.186
Class is not cancelled!

28:32.220 --> 28:33.856
[everybody talking at once]

28:33.890 --> 28:35.159
Hey! Come on!

28:35.192 --> 28:38.733
Let's listen
to Dwight's presentation.

28:40.268 --> 28:41.671
What--what
are you winking for?

28:41.706 --> 28:42.708
Zip your lid!

28:42.741 --> 28:45.547
So that's my basic
five year plan.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.551
And then after that,
who knows?

28:47.584 --> 28:49.121
Okay.

28:49.154 --> 28:51.492
And now, this may seem
like an odd question.

28:51.526 --> 28:53.530
Yeah?

28:53.563 --> 28:55.500
What do you think
about Michael Scott?

28:55.534 --> 28:57.103
He's a very nice man.

28:57.137 --> 28:58.606
Mm-hmm.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.078
And he's very well-suited
for the job he has now.

29:01.111 --> 29:02.514
This is off the record.

29:02.548 --> 29:04.484
He would be a disaster.

29:09.928 --> 29:10.898
Hey, you!

29:10.930 --> 29:13.069
Hey.

29:13.101 --> 29:14.873
How was your interview?

29:14.906 --> 29:16.207
Pretty good.
Yeah?

29:16.241 --> 29:17.643
Could've gone better,
I guess.

29:17.677 --> 29:20.684
Oh, well, I will put in
a good word for you.

29:20.716 --> 29:23.623
Cool. Maybe you should do it
sooner rather than later.

29:23.655 --> 29:24.925
What?

29:24.958 --> 29:25.960
Uh, let's just run away
together.

29:25.994 --> 29:27.130
Let's run away
to Jamaica,

29:27.162 --> 29:28.265
live in a bungalow.

29:28.298 --> 29:29.635
You have some savings,
right?

29:29.667 --> 29:30.637
You can pay off my debts.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.306
It would be fine.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.643
We'd have fun.

29:33.675 --> 29:35.847
What's--
what's the matter?

29:35.880 --> 29:37.819
W-what happened
in there?

29:37.851 --> 29:41.125
I can't tell you.

29:41.158 --> 29:42.661
Tell me what?

29:49.642 --> 29:51.078
You son of a bitch.

29:51.111 --> 29:53.048
Jan, this isn't the time--

29:53.082 --> 29:54.251
You're firing me?

29:54.284 --> 29:56.054
Where the hell
do you get off?

29:56.088 --> 29:57.624
[sighs]

29:57.658 --> 29:59.227
Frankly, it's overdue.

29:59.261 --> 30:01.699
Your behavior
in the last two years

30:01.732 --> 30:02.768
has been completely erratic.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.637
Erratic?

30:04.671 --> 30:06.140
Recently, you don't even show
an interest in your work!

30:06.175 --> 30:08.112
You smoke constantly
in your office.

30:08.145 --> 30:10.249
You spend most of the day
online shopping.

30:10.282 --> 30:12.753
You disappear for hours
at a time, sometimes days,

30:12.787 --> 30:15.292
always saying you're visiting
your sister in Scottsdale.

30:15.325 --> 30:17.262
You go to Scranton
far more often than you need to.

30:17.296 --> 30:18.398
Is it because of these?

30:18.432 --> 30:20.102
Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan--

30:20.136 --> 30:21.238
I wanna know--
I wanna know!

30:21.270 --> 30:24.444
Because if it is, then--
then I will see you in court.

30:24.476 --> 30:26.280
It's not. It's not.
No.

30:26.315 --> 30:27.851
'Cause he likes them.
Okay?

30:27.885 --> 30:30.690
He likes them, and that is--
that is all I care about.

30:30.724 --> 30:32.126
The time has come
for you to end

30:32.160 --> 30:34.363
your professional relationship
with this company.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.435
You are clearly unstable.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.738
Hey, you're unstable!

30:37.771 --> 30:38.740
(Jan)
Yeah.

30:38.773 --> 30:41.712
No.
We're all unstable.

30:41.746 --> 30:43.282
Okay, you know what,
I'm just not leaving!

30:43.315 --> 30:45.186
I'm not leaving.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.989
(Jan)
Not leaving.

30:47.022 --> 30:49.426
David,
I did not tell her.

31:02.253 --> 31:03.222
It's like I'm staring
into my soul

31:03.255 --> 31:05.359
when I look
at this wall.

31:05.393 --> 31:08.031
It's like outer space
without the stars.

31:08.065 --> 31:09.367
It's so black.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.906
This is gonna look
so awesome!

31:11.939 --> 31:13.042
It's so intimidating.

31:13.075 --> 31:14.311
Anyone who comes in here

31:14.343 --> 31:16.081
is gonna have to take me
seriously.

31:16.115 --> 31:18.953
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

31:18.987 --> 31:19.955
[laughter]

31:19.989 --> 31:21.058
(Andy)
Totally.

31:31.610 --> 31:32.580
Bye, Hunter.

31:32.612 --> 31:33.582
Bye.

31:33.614 --> 31:35.218
[Jan exhales loudly]

31:35.252 --> 31:37.222
Good luck with your band.

31:37.256 --> 31:38.224
Oh, thank--

31:38.258 --> 31:39.361
Don't let them
change you.

31:39.394 --> 31:41.130
Okay?

31:44.872 --> 31:46.308
[clattering]

32:01.570 --> 32:03.542
So long, [bleep].

32:06.014 --> 32:09.387
So I am gonna give her
a ride home.

32:09.421 --> 32:11.157
Let me know about the job.

32:11.191 --> 32:12.928
Actually, Michael,
I think we're gonna take it

32:12.961 --> 32:14.063
in another direction.

32:14.097 --> 32:15.532
Good, I'm glad we're
on the same page.

32:15.565 --> 32:17.370
I have a lot of ideas
for new directions.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.208
No, we're not giving you
the job.

32:25.419 --> 32:26.421
You know what?

32:26.455 --> 32:28.591
That is actually good

32:28.625 --> 32:31.498
because, um...

32:31.530 --> 32:34.571
I don't think I could take
my girlfriend's job.

32:34.603 --> 32:36.575
That's not being
a good boyfriend.

32:36.608 --> 32:41.418
So I respectfully withdraw
my name from consideration.

32:43.721 --> 32:45.593
Do you accept
my withdrawal?

32:45.626 --> 32:47.396
I do.
Good, very good.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.601
I am glad we are finally
on the same page.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.505
Still have my job
in Scranton though?

32:51.538 --> 32:53.075
Yes.
Good.

32:53.109 --> 32:54.577
It's all I ever wanted.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.548
These two...

32:56.581 --> 32:58.619
either one of them...

32:58.652 --> 33:01.190
excellent candidates.

33:03.962 --> 33:05.466
Wow.

33:05.498 --> 33:06.468
[laughs]

33:06.500 --> 33:11.111
That was some serious,
hardcore self-destruction.

33:11.144 --> 33:12.380
Yeah.

33:12.412 --> 33:13.782
Kinda feel bad
for her though.

33:13.815 --> 33:16.187
Don't. She's nuts.

33:16.221 --> 33:18.024
[laughter]

33:18.059 --> 33:19.660
Oh, man.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.134
You know what?
This might take a while.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.138
You really don't have to stay,
if you don't want.

33:25.173 --> 33:27.642
Okay, good, because a bunch
of my friends

33:27.677 --> 33:29.247
are meeting downtown
for lunch,

33:29.280 --> 33:30.516
and I was gonna meet them.

33:30.549 --> 33:31.751
Okay.
So...

33:31.784 --> 33:32.786
Just call me
when you're done.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.624
Sure.

33:34.656 --> 33:35.725
Good luck, Halpert.
Thank you.

33:41.705 --> 33:43.309
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Grace.

33:43.341 --> 33:45.478
Sure.

33:49.286 --> 33:50.488
Oh, God!

33:50.522 --> 33:51.857
I mean,
I just don't understand.

33:51.890 --> 33:53.861
It's just so rude,
you know?

33:53.894 --> 33:55.633
I mean, the absolute nerve
of that guy!

33:55.666 --> 33:56.668
I am sorry about that.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.869
Oh, just...
That was terrible.

33:57.902 --> 33:59.506
No, actually, I think
it's good.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.875
You know, it's fine
actually.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.247
I-I do.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.083
I really think
it's great that it happened,

34:04.083 --> 34:05.686
because, you know,
my work has always been

34:05.719 --> 34:06.688
the thing that's gotten
in the way

34:06.721 --> 34:07.690
of my happiness, so...

34:07.723 --> 34:08.691
Mm-hmm, yeah.

34:08.725 --> 34:09.693
[laughter]

34:09.727 --> 34:12.132
Well, it's...

34:12.167 --> 34:14.703
[crying]

34:14.736 --> 34:17.876
[high-pitched whining]

34:17.910 --> 34:19.914
No, don't cry.

34:19.947 --> 34:20.916
It's gonna be okay.

34:20.948 --> 34:23.422
Oh, I know, I know.

34:23.454 --> 34:24.823
It's just...
I'm sorry.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.894
It's just these painkillers
that I started taking

34:26.928 --> 34:28.732
since the surgery.

34:28.764 --> 34:32.839
Oh, they make my moods
totally unpredictable.

34:32.873 --> 34:34.444
Wow.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.748
What am I gonna do?

34:39.886 --> 34:44.831
Well, I guess you could come
and stay at my condo.

34:44.864 --> 34:47.203
I think I could back out
of the sale.

34:47.237 --> 34:49.207
Probably get
some negative feedback

34:49.241 --> 34:50.309
on my eBay profile.

34:50.343 --> 34:51.311
Live together...

34:51.345 --> 34:52.280
Actually, wait a minute.

34:52.313 --> 34:53.282
This could be great.

34:53.315 --> 34:54.616
This could be perfect.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.755
You know, my full-time job
could be our relationship.

34:56.788 --> 34:57.989
I could wear stretch pants
and wait for you

34:58.022 --> 34:58.892
to come home at 5:15.

34:58.924 --> 35:00.428
[laughing]
It could work,
this could work!

35:00.463 --> 35:02.233
Really.

35:11.985 --> 35:13.955
[as The Terminator]
I'll be back.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.496
And I am back.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.699
How'd it go?

35:18.732 --> 35:20.469
No. No, Pam.

35:20.502 --> 35:22.939
[as The Terminator]
I'm back.

35:22.973 --> 35:25.512
For good.

35:25.546 --> 35:26.947
Kevin Nealon.

35:26.981 --> 35:29.421
Everybody, may I have
your attention please?

35:29.453 --> 35:33.394
It is with great honor
and privilege

35:33.429 --> 35:35.965
that I announce to you,
I have officially withdrawn

35:35.999 --> 35:39.039
my name for consideration
from the corporate job.

35:39.071 --> 35:41.744
I know, I know,
I know.

35:41.778 --> 35:43.047
"Michael,
what are you thinking?

35:43.079 --> 35:44.049
You were a shoo-in."

35:44.081 --> 35:46.053
Well, got down there.

35:46.085 --> 35:48.057
I nailed the interview.

35:48.089 --> 35:50.762
And the strangest thing
happened.

35:50.796 --> 35:53.569
Why is my office black?

35:53.601 --> 35:55.906
To intimidate
my subordinates.

35:55.939 --> 35:57.577
That's stupid.

35:57.609 --> 35:58.979
It was Andy's idea.

35:59.012 --> 36:00.548
You shouldn't have taken it.

36:00.583 --> 36:02.619
Bad management.

36:02.652 --> 36:05.858
Good thing I'm back.

36:05.893 --> 36:07.897
Ryan, coffee.

36:07.930 --> 36:09.601
I don't do
that stuff anymore.

36:09.633 --> 36:11.971
No, it's for me,
bimbo.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.073
Kids.

36:13.106 --> 36:15.043
So I'm back.

36:15.077 --> 36:22.091
And I am never, ever
going to leave.

36:22.124 --> 36:25.866
I am going nowhere.

36:25.899 --> 36:29.407
This place is like...

36:29.441 --> 36:32.680
the hospital
where I was born,

36:32.712 --> 36:35.150
my house,

36:35.184 --> 36:39.527
my old age home,

36:39.561 --> 36:41.697
and my graveyard...

36:41.730 --> 36:44.035
for my bones.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.707
Did Karen get the job?

36:49.179 --> 36:50.748
Back to work.

36:50.782 --> 36:52.085
Still waiting
on that coffee.

37:06.614 --> 37:07.917
Pam, hello.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.019
Dwight, hello.

37:09.051 --> 37:10.888
I wanted to thank you.

37:12.190 --> 37:14.263
For helping me...

37:14.296 --> 37:16.065
when you held the title

37:16.098 --> 37:19.205
of secret assistant
to the regional manager.

37:21.143 --> 37:25.217
You served the office
with great dignity.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.638
No, I don't know
what the future holds,

37:35.673 --> 37:38.310
but I'm optimistic.

37:38.343 --> 37:42.051
And, uh, I had fun goofing
around with Dwight today.

37:44.055 --> 37:47.730
Jim and I
are just too similar.

37:49.232 --> 37:52.872
Maybe one day I'll find
my own Karen.

37:52.906 --> 37:55.144
But--you--that is a, um...

37:55.177 --> 37:56.980
You know, not--

37:57.014 --> 37:58.150
A man.

37:58.183 --> 37:59.920
A man version.

37:59.953 --> 38:03.928
But, uh, until then...

38:03.961 --> 38:06.734
I can hold my head up.

38:06.768 --> 38:08.804
I'm not gay.

38:08.839 --> 38:11.978
I don't know how I feel
about hiring a Sixers fan.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.314
I should leave.

38:13.347 --> 38:14.783
[laughter]

38:14.817 --> 38:15.953
Now, let me ask you
a question, Jim.

38:15.986 --> 38:17.355
You're clearly
a very bright guy.

38:17.389 --> 38:18.758
Thanks.
Always hit your numbers.

38:18.791 --> 38:20.829
Personable, you make
a great impression

38:20.862 --> 38:22.165
on everyone you meet.
I'm sorry, wait.

38:22.198 --> 38:24.202
So is the question
how'd I get to be so awesome?

38:24.234 --> 38:26.005
[laughter]

38:26.038 --> 38:27.007
Because I don't have
an answer for you.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.914
Oh, uh, hey, do you have
your quarterly numbers?

38:29.946 --> 38:31.082
Yes, absolutely.

38:31.116 --> 38:32.185
And that, uh,
questionnaire?

38:32.218 --> 38:33.086
Sorry to make you fill
that thing out.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.291
Oh, no, absolutely.
Stupid HR formality.

38:35.324 --> 38:38.263
We have this very irritating
HR guy here.

38:38.297 --> 38:39.866
He's probably the only person
you're not gonna like.

38:39.901 --> 38:43.440
Kendall. Ugh.

38:43.473 --> 38:45.978
So first up.

38:46.012 --> 38:47.014
There you go.

38:47.047 --> 38:48.016
How do you think
you'd function

38:48.049 --> 38:49.420
here in New York?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.758
What's that?

38:51.791 --> 38:53.327
Oh, uh, great.
You know?

38:53.361 --> 38:56.199
I just, um, I really appreciate
the buildings,

38:56.233 --> 38:58.403
and, uh, the people.

38:58.438 --> 39:02.077
And, um, there's just
an energy that New York has.

39:02.110 --> 39:03.213
Mm-hmm.
Uh...

39:03.247 --> 39:06.018
Not to mention, they have places
that are open past 8:00.

39:06.053 --> 39:07.757
[laughter]
So that's a bonus.

39:07.790 --> 39:08.892
You've been
in the Scranton branch

39:08.924 --> 39:10.194
a long time.

39:10.227 --> 39:13.467
What have you liked most
about that place?

39:16.238 --> 39:17.943
The friendships.

39:17.976 --> 39:19.311
Okay.

39:19.344 --> 39:21.850
Well, we want the person
who takes this position

39:21.885 --> 39:23.988
to be here
for the long haul.

39:24.022 --> 39:26.493
So...long haul.

39:26.527 --> 39:28.330
Where do you see yourself
in ten years?

39:38.216 --> 39:40.086
How are your feet?

39:40.120 --> 39:41.457
Medium rare.

39:41.489 --> 39:43.327
Thanks.

39:45.564 --> 39:47.268
The real reason
that I went to Stamford

39:47.301 --> 39:51.811
was because
I wanted to be...

39:51.845 --> 39:55.250
not here.

39:55.284 --> 39:57.857
I know.

39:57.890 --> 40:02.531
And even though
I came back,

40:02.566 --> 40:04.803
I just feel like

40:04.803 --> 40:09.012
I've never
really come back.

40:16.159 --> 40:18.330
Well, I wish you would.

40:23.306 --> 40:25.913
[phone rings]

40:25.946 --> 40:29.019
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

40:29.051 --> 40:31.089
Just one moment,
I'll transfer you.

40:31.122 --> 40:32.526
(Pam)
I haven't heard anything.

40:32.558 --> 40:34.996
But I bet Jim
got the job.

40:35.031 --> 40:36.298
I mean, why wouldn't he?

40:36.332 --> 40:38.538
He's totally qualified
and smart.

40:38.571 --> 40:41.009
Everyone loves him.

40:41.043 --> 40:44.951
And if he
never comes back again,

40:44.984 --> 40:47.287
that's okay.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.392
We're friends.

40:49.425 --> 40:52.364
And I'm sure
we'll stay friends.

40:52.398 --> 40:55.104
We just...we never got
the timing right.

40:55.136 --> 40:56.305
You know?

40:56.338 --> 41:01.049
I shot him down, and then
he did the same to me, and...

41:01.083 --> 41:02.051
But you know what?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.453
It's okay.

41:03.488 --> 41:04.923
I am totally fine.

41:04.923 --> 41:07.295
Everything
is gonna be totally--

41:07.327 --> 41:08.697
Pam. Sorry.

41:08.730 --> 41:12.706
Um, are you free
for dinner tonight?

41:12.738 --> 41:14.342
Yes.

41:14.374 --> 41:15.411
All right.

41:15.444 --> 41:19.185
Then it's a date.

41:25.464 --> 41:27.468
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

41:28.504 --> 41:31.242
So I know we left the other day
on a note of uncertainty,

41:31.276 --> 41:32.345
but after some more thought,

41:32.377 --> 41:35.684
I'm very pleased to be able
to offer you this job.

41:35.718 --> 41:37.788
[laughing]
Great.

41:37.821 --> 41:39.526
I'm so glad.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.530
We're all very excited
you're gonna be joining us.

41:41.564 --> 41:43.500
It'll be nice to have
another MBA around here.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.173
I'm excited too.

41:46.206 --> 41:48.077
Okay.

41:48.110 --> 41:50.548
Bye.

41:50.582 --> 41:51.550
Who was that?

41:51.584 --> 41:53.721
Nobody.

41:53.753 --> 41:55.191
You and I are done.

41:55.224 --> 41:57.228
What?!
