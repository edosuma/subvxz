07:40.168 --> 07:41.668
I just don't understand why
she's with this dude.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.503
CEDRIC: Nobody does. How
good is your credit?

07:43.921 --> 07:45.839
It's up. Low 400s, 430?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.966
Goddamn! A 430?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.010
You can't even get a Discover Card!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.636
Don't white people start off
with a 500 credit score?

07:51.804 --> 07:54.181
Five-fifty, 475 if you're a mulatto.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.599
GAIL: Cedric!

07:55.725 --> 07:56.933
Yes, Gail.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.602
Gail, listen to what I'm trying to say!

07:58.686 --> 07:59.769
Gail, I don't care!

07:59.937 --> 08:01.480
I don't care what you take out the garage!

08:01.564 --> 08:02.898
Gail, you can take the whole damn garage.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.649
Let me tell you something.
Here's what I want,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.151
and this is what's... [PHONE BEEPS] Hello?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.360
Gail?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.570
Y'all, I swear...

08:08.654 --> 08:10.447
She didn't let me finish my sentence.
I don't like that.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.657
Hey, Ced. When's the divorce
gonna be final?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.242
Goodness, if I had to guess,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.203
I'd say like four weeks, 367 hours,

08:16.370 --> 08:17.787
22 minutes, 32 seconds.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.914
That's just a guess.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.624
Who's counting? ZEKE: But you
know what we should do?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.876
We should take Cedric out for
celebration game night.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.336
I can't do Sunday. This Sunday,

08:24.420 --> 08:26.421
dinner with my ma. Little
casserole action...

08:26.547 --> 08:27.547
JEREMY: That's every Sunday.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.009
I can't do Sunday either. Jonah's
got a violin recital.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.470
My God, dude, your kid has
way too many recitals.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.056
Wait a minute, hold on, wait.
Your son play the violin?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.933
And the cello. Yo, he's gay.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.017
Playing the violin doesn't make him gay.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.184
Yes, it does.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.352
Name me one gay violinist.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.479
Your son.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.647
Listen to this.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.024
Cedric is about to be released from
the shackles of Gail-Hell.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.109
Forever. And we're about
to miss it for what?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.486
Another Jonah recital.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.613
By the way, he sucks. BENNETT: Really?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.448
I'd expect that from them, not you.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.741
What do you mean, "them"?

08:54.825 --> 08:56.034
Like what, like black people or what?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.369
Absolutely.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.412
I don't get mad because he's
bold enough to say it.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.331
Seriously, you have ears. Kid's tone-deaf.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.875
This is his big solo. They're
playing the Gap Band.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.335
You know, Dropped a Bomb on Me,

09:05.419 --> 09:07.128
and he's got the last...
[MIMICS PLAYING] "Baby!"

09:07.296 --> 09:09.839
Look, I got a great idea. I'll
have my mom cook for us.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.758
She'll make some chocolate chip
cookies, a big casserole.

09:11.842 --> 09:12.926
We'll do it the right way.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.970
Mike, I almost punched you in
your damn face just now, man.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.096
And I was gonna add a head butt.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.597
I'm not going over your mom house

09:17.682 --> 09:18.974
to celebrate my damn divorce party!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.141
We gotta eat. We can start there...

09:20.226 --> 09:21.393
I don't wanna eat with your mom!

09:21.477 --> 09:22.769
I ain't going over his mom house.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.563
Look, she just got the new Tyler Perry,

09:24.647 --> 09:26.189
For Colored Girls on Blu-ray.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.774
We'll just have a nice
little fellas night,

09:27.858 --> 09:28.984
a chill-out night.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.152
Let me tell you what happens, Janet
Jackson gets AIDS at the end

09:31.237 --> 09:33.697
and some crazy guy throws his kids
out the window. You good?

09:33.781 --> 09:35.448
Can we party now? Let's do it! I hate you.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.576
All right, put 'em up! Yes, sir.

09:39.745 --> 09:40.912
Fine, I'm in, man.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.416
Life is great, fellas.
May it never change.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.501
CEDRIC: None of us could have known

09:46.586 --> 09:47.919
that the first bomb had been dropped.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.421
The war had been declared.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.047
And hard-worn secrets

09:51.132 --> 09:52.966
had now fallen into the
hands of the enemy.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.010
We had been betrayed by one of our own.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.219
A man.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.971
I'm talking about a man with a penis.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.723
Someone who should know better.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.642
And because of those actions,
a blitz was now on its way,

10:02.810 --> 10:05.228
that would affect my entire
Band of Brothers.

VICKI: We have another question
in the audience, Steve.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.815
Steve, I keep hooking up with guys

10:08.899 --> 10:10.025
who don't want a relationship.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.443
Why don't you stop hooking up?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.652
Did you hear that?

10:12.778 --> 10:16.406
Listen, men respect women
who have standards.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.699

WOMAN 2: Steve, I'm a partner
in my law firm,

10:21.829 --> 10:22.996
I own my own home,

10:23.164 --> 10:25.040
but I've been single for three years.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.834
Why can't I seem to find a man
to live up to my standards?

10:28.002 --> 10:29.961
Maybe you need to adjust
them a little bit.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.963
Bullshit. VICKI: Are you saying
that we should settle?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.633
Look, you make six figures.
Does he have to?

10:34.717 --> 10:35.717
Yes.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.136
You own your own home. Does he have to?

10:38.220 --> 10:39.304
Yes and yes.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.014
VICKI: We have another question
here in the audience.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.642
Hi, Steve. I'm currently dating

10:43.726 --> 10:44.934
and I just wanna know

10:45.102 --> 10:46.436
when is the right time for me

10:46.520 --> 10:49.064
to introduce my man to my kid? Oh!

10:49.231 --> 10:51.775
I know that single women
don't want to have

10:51.859 --> 10:53.818
a parade of men coming through the house.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.070
Exactly! I get that.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.197
But if a guy is a serious contender...
What up, Momma?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.531
Excuse you?

10:58.699 --> 11:00.492
...bring him in as soon as
possible. Morning, Mom.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.494
Because if you invest six months in a man

11:02.620 --> 11:04.329
and then you introduce him to the kids

11:04.497 --> 11:07.916
and he's not feeling the
kids, or vice versa,

11:08.084 --> 11:10.710
then guess what? You just
wasted six months.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.754
That's true. Did that.

11:18.844 --> 11:23.306

double-shot lattes.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.612
Thanks, baby. Here.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.615
Figured we needed some caffeine
after last night.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.576
It was amazing. Mmm-hmm.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.039
I'm gonna go and freshen up.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.668
So, I'll be right back.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.545

12:00.469 --> 12:02.345
So, babe, I was thinking

12:02.430 --> 12:04.514
maybe we could go on our first real date.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.391
We could go see a movie? Yeah, babe.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.517
We should do that.

Things between us are gonna start
getting real serious, baby.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.107
MYA: Okay, so I was thinking maybe we could
go see the new Tyler Perry movie.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.275
You know, the one where the guy's,

12:15.359 --> 12:16.484
like, mean to his girlfriend,

12:16.652 --> 12:18.653
and a nice guy comes and rescues her

12:18.738 --> 12:20.864
and at the end, they both find Jesus.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.368
Alex? So, yes to the Tyler Perry movie?

12:47.808 --> 12:49.058

in hardcover and paperback.

For my book club.

For the first time in their
lives, women all over

12:57.818 --> 13:00.612
stopped turning to other women
for relationship advice.

to a man, Steve Harvey.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.787
it's good enough for me.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.581
See, when I worked at Ford Motor Company,

27:05.665 --> 27:07.666
there was a 90-day probation rule.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.835
I had to be on the job for 90 days

27:09.919 --> 27:11.503
before they gave me a benefit package.

27:11.671 --> 27:14.798

see how he performs.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.926

27:18.011 --> 27:19.845
"then we'll give him benefits."

27:20.013 --> 27:22.640
So if Ford Motor Company waits 90 days

27:22.724 --> 27:24.975
to pass out their benefit package,

27:25.352 --> 27:26.685
why won't women wait?

27:26.853 --> 27:27.895
You see, that's our problem.

I told you the ugly panty
trick would work.

You wasn't trying to listen
