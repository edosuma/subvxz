00:02.735 --> 00:04.636
So you're a mom?
I didn't know that.

00:04.704 --> 00:07.764
- He's not yours.
- Some guy from Boston's the dad.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.968
Gavin Goddard is Sam's father's name.

00:10.043 --> 00:13.206
- Did you ever miss me?
- Hannah, of course I missed you.

00:13.279 --> 00:15.804
They love each other.
It's clear as day.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.009
Everybody out, boys!

00:18.084 --> 00:22.020
Fights are gross. Particularly the ones
you send your friends to go and fight.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.648
The fact that you don't leave the house
doesn't bother me.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.282
Would you please wait?

00:26.393 --> 00:29.328
Hey, Eddie. It's me.
Just making sure we're still on.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.489
- Maybe something came up.
- He doesn't want to be seen with me.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.124
- You meet Alison yet?
- [Nick] Owen Rowan's wife?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.327
- I had sex with her.
- What?

00:36.403 --> 00:40.362
There's too much that can be lost
if we don't stop.

00:41.641 --> 00:45.008
- Hey, Big Cat. What goes on?
- Something I want to talk to you about.

Hey. I left you a few messages.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.239
Eddie, I can't. Not here.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.473
All right. How about later?

01:21.581 --> 01:25.073
Look, I get it. I listened
to the messages. I hear you.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.746
But I just can't
do this with you, not now.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.017
- Then when?
- Honestly, man?

01:31.091 --> 01:35.221
Be a good guy and just leave me alone.
OK? Please?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.074
Uh, for delivery, please.

- They say Sam's gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.734
Next Thursday he gets his stitches out.
Should be back to normal.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.576
Except for this little scar here.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.650
Scars are cool. I, myself, own 11.

02:31.718 --> 02:35.745
Off-topic, but can I just say again
how hot Aubrey is.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.256
Yes, you can, for the 793rd time.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.484
[Owen] I mean, wow.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.152
You know, she's smart, too and bold.
I like her.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.287
- What goes on with Hannah?
- Nothing.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.924
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, no reason.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.163
Just that every geometry class
needs a few good triangles.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.364
- He teaches English.
- And I deal in metaphor.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.631
It's weird with Hannah.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.041
Like every time we hang out,
like that night in the hospital,

02:59.112 --> 03:02.172
it's all snug and warm,
like slow-dancing.

03:02.248 --> 03:05.479
Except we never
seem to be hearing the same music.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.646
- Lot of stepping on toes.
- Constant.

Hey, bro!
Things go betta with extra feta!

03:27.807 --> 03:29.672
Where's Pizza Girl?

03:29.742 --> 03:33.371
She has requested that
I make all the deliveries to 32 Gelson,

but don't worry, little dude,
I get it there fast, hot and fresh.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.378
- Keep the change.
- Later, bro.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.540
- Big Cat Cataldo keeps calling me.
- What?

04:02.609 --> 04:04.577
Three times this week.
Weird, right?

04:04.677 --> 04:07.009
- What's he want?
- To put a sit-down on the books.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.981
A sit-down.
Who's he, Al Capone all of the sudden?

04:10.049 --> 04:11.812
- A sit-down about what?
- He won't say.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.079
I got no interest
in talking to that flat-head.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.850
- Maybe about Eddie's business.
- He's down to his last two accounts.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.858
- How come?
- One word, Big Cat Cataldo.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.429
I can maintain all seven properties

- All right, deal.

- Come on, let me give you a ride.
- All right.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.531
Why is Big Cat gunning for Eddie?

04:37.410 --> 04:40.709
Because of me?
Because of Hannah.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.214
'Cause he blames you for their breakup.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.547
He thinks he can hurt you
by hurting Eddie.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.915
He wants to hurt all of us.

04:46.986 --> 04:50.945
The thing that's always creased Big Cat
is that he wasn't a part of our gang.

04:51.057 --> 04:55.494
That he never rolled with us through
the streams and across the valleys.

04:55.561 --> 04:58.086
That he was never a member
of The Night Brigade.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.622
- Since when are we The Night Brigade?
- Let him be. He's a shut-in.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.261
Once a week
he has to make proclamations.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.702
You know what? This has gotta stop.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.901
I know a way we can help Eddie
and hurt Ray at the same time.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.742

since we were kids, right?

To open a store
that sold and installed windows.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.546
Huh?

It's not easy
opening a business by yourself.

I got Owen Rowan and Ronnie helping out.

06:03.963 --> 06:08.024
Oh, I didn't realize you were assembling
such an elite squadron.

06:08.101 --> 06:12.538
Aubrey's lovely. And she's talented.

- Her story or your relationship?
- The story of our relationship.

- You got a girlfriend, Ronnie?
- Me? Nah.

06:29.155 --> 06:34.252
- Well's been dry for a while now.
- I know some hotties at the college.

with the whole fix-up thing.

You know, growing up with the shadow
of the Nick and Hannah legend,

06:43.436 --> 06:45.734
the bar was set pretty high.

of me, but, um, I baked a cake...

speeding along the convalescence, so...

- You, too.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.400
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.378
I just wanted to drop this off.
I don't want to interrupt.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.540
- No, not at all.
- We were just gabbing.

07:29.615 --> 07:33.745
- Nice. I haven't done that in years.
- Seriously? No gabbing?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.788
A gab-free existence?
Sounds bleak.

07:35.888 --> 07:39.255

didn't come with a lot of girlfriends.

07:39.358 --> 07:40.416

It was really important to Owen
that we raise our kids in Knights Ridge.

- Yeah.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.564

You're getting a little gabbing in.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.728

07:57.810 --> 07:59.835
- I miss her.
- Pizza Girl?

08:01.147 --> 08:05.243
She not only gave me
context and serenity.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.946
She... she gave me location.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.320
- I need you to go to her.
- To Pizza Girl?

Doodie thinks he's discovered a planet,
a moving planet.

he's discovered an airplane.

09:11.951 --> 09:15.045

- OK, I guess.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.215
Doctor says I'm not supposed to
do a lot of running around.

- Don't want to pull a stitch and all.
- No. Don't want to do that.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.563
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.395
You know, we were all
really worried about you.

09:30.002 --> 09:34.166
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Sure.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.070
Do you ever sometimes think

09:40.146 --> 09:43.115
that maybe you're my dad?

09:50.856 --> 09:54.690
Yeah, I do.
I did.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.754
And I really liked the idea of it a lot,

09:57.830 --> 10:00.162
but then your mom told me
about Gavin Goddard.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.237
So, what goes on with Gavin Goddard?

10:06.305 --> 10:10.139
Word is, Gavin Goddard is the richest
man in the world,

10:10.209 --> 10:12.700
that he lives in a castle in the clouds

10:12.778 --> 10:16.475

- Soon enough, baby brother.

Tell me this. What the hell
do you guys know about windows?

11:36.062 --> 11:38.997
Besides they're made of glass
and they let in the light?

I'm still waiting
on that powwow, Big O.

Why don't you just tell me
what you have to tell me now?

11:50.976 --> 11:55.072
Well, it's a private matter,
just me and you.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.172
It's better that way.

11:57.249 --> 12:02.084
I don't really like you, Big Cat, so I
don't really want to sit down with you.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.849
Well, suit yourself.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.788
But here's the thing, fellas.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.622
See, windows are made of glass.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.095
Glass breaks easier than hearts,

12:12.164 --> 12:14.257
bones or graham crackers.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.196
Hoo-dee-hoo.

Rebel, rebel, you've torn your dress.

- Have you had a Western Omelet?
- Yes, it was nice.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.390
Nice, huh?
What about the Chicken Fried Steak?

12:47.466 --> 12:49.024
It's OK.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.660
Which one do you think's
gonna make me happier?

12:51.737 --> 12:54.900
Well, if you're in the mood for steak,
I'd order the steak.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.705
If you're in the mood for eggs,
I'd say go with the eggs.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.804
I sense that you're not
as enthusiastic about the eggs.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.516
- What's going on? Did I over-banter?
- No.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.776
No, no.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.324
Do you remember
last week in the hospital?

13:13.392 --> 13:16.225
There was something that old man said

13:16.295 --> 13:18.456
and then it came up again
with your brother.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.624
Never listen to what he says.
He's an unreliable narrator.

It goes together so perfectly.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.705
The golden couple.

13:34.914 --> 13:38.941
So I gotta ask,
is there still a part of you

13:39.018 --> 13:42.385
that yearns to return
to the glory days of Nick and Hannah?

13:47.326 --> 13:51.660
- Time's up! Three-second violation.
- It's very complicated with Hannah.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.891
It's not complicated.

13:53.966 --> 13:58.699
It's everywhere...

- It's obvious.
- No, it won't.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.172

14:08.547 --> 14:10.845
It's a crowded room right now.

14:10.916 --> 14:14.283
There's Nick and Aubrey and Hannah.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.877
And Nick and Hannah.
And Hannah and Sam.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.514
And Nick and Sam.

14:18.624 --> 14:21.525
We can field a baseball team, Nick.

14:23.562 --> 14:27.225
But I don't know
that we can start a relationship.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.998
And for that I am very sorry.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.776
Hey. Excuse me.

14:42.848 --> 14:46.682
You're Phil's friend.
Um, Tony? You serenaded us.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.879
That's right.
Only my real name is Owen.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.014
And I have a request on account of Phil.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.994
- What's that?
- Thirty-two Gelson Road.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.621
Please be there tomorrow at 4:00.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.494
That's Phil's address.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.931
That's right.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.562
Look, um, Phil is sweeter than sweet.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.165
Lovely. He's the mom's lasagna.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.204
But, um, it's my bad.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.840
The truth is, I can't hang.
It's too hard.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.944
- But Phil is the best guy there is.
- I would agree.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.881
And I totally understand his reasons
for not wanting to leave the house,

15:26.992 --> 15:29.290
that the world changed
six Septembers ago

15:29.361 --> 15:31.921
and he doesn't want to be a part of it.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.033
- But I love roller coasters.
- Roller coasters?

15:37.503 --> 15:39.869
It's not just roller coasters.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.836
I mean, it's the beach...

15:43.943 --> 15:45.604
...the museum.

15:46.211 --> 15:50.739
It's Tuscany or
my niece's dance recital, you know?

15:50.816 --> 15:53.376
It's David Bowie live in concert.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.146
You get it.
It's...

15:55.220 --> 15:58.656
It's "out here" stuff.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.692
Just give him a chance.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.456
Thirty-two Gelson, tomorrow at 4:00.

16:05.731 --> 16:06.857
Um...

16:09.802 --> 16:11.929
Please send him my best.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.346
[Hannah] It's 150 a week for boarding.

16:29.421 --> 16:32.788
And that includes grooming
and teeth cleaning.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.018
OK, does he get to go outside?

16:35.094 --> 16:37.654
Well, I'll walk him twice a day myself.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.698
OK, that sounds good.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.464
Where you going?

16:44.536 --> 16:48.802
I'm going back home, to Berkeley,
for just a couple weeks.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.575
- So, Sam's on the mend?
- Yeah. He's great.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.011
- Good.
- Thanks.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.777
How's Nick doing?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.017
He's fine. He's OK.

17:06.892 --> 17:10.657
We're not really hanging out anymore.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.321
- He didn't do anything stupid, did he?
- No.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.463
It was just cumbersome.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.467
- He'll make a stand, you know.
- What do you mean?

17:24.576 --> 17:26.134
It's what he does.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.078
Nick is the patron saint
of impulsive gestures.

17:30.282 --> 17:33.046
Trust me, he'll do something
that'll surprise you.

17:33.118 --> 17:36.576
Whether it's singing a song
in front of all of Knights Ridge,

17:37.356 --> 17:39.722
or writing a book about you.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.923
Showing up at your doorstep
when you least expect it

17:43.996 --> 17:45.361
to ask for a second chance.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.431
You just have to give him an opening.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.903
- This better be good.
- It's good all right.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.372
I'm talking
Angela Venezzia belly ring good.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.444
- Oh, come on. I got a lot of work.
- Oh, come on, cry-baby.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.807
- Here we go.
- Hurry up!

18:00.879 --> 18:03.006
Yeah!

18:03.082 --> 18:05.607
- Check it.
- [Hooting]

18:11.890 --> 18:14.723
Uh... I don't get it.

18:14.793 --> 18:18.251
Ten years in the making,
Eddie, but we did it.

18:19.998 --> 18:23.058
- Did what?
- Best Friend Windows.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.795
Right here, right now.
This is it. It's all ours.

18:26.872 --> 18:30.535
- We finally get to live the dream.
- [Lkey] And the best part about it?

18:30.609 --> 18:33.578
It's gonna so piss off Big Cat!

18:33.679 --> 18:36.204
So, what do you say, Eddie, huh?

18:40.352 --> 18:42.980
Uh... what do I say?

18:43.055 --> 18:44.215
Uh...

18:45.390 --> 18:47.449
You got some stones on ya, Nicky.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.586
Nick was just trying to do a nice thing.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.789
"A nice thing"? Huh?

18:52.865 --> 18:54.890
What is this?
Rub the lamp, make a wish,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.936
Nicholson Garrett comes through
ten years on the late?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.436
- I don't need charity.
- It's not like that.

19:02.508 --> 19:06.467
No, these things, Nick, that you do,
to come back here and make it right?

19:06.578 --> 19:09.604
Come back and be a hero. It disgusts me.

19:09.681 --> 19:12.149
I don't know how you live with yourself.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.712
You're pitiful, man.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.526
- What'd you say to me?
- Slow down.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.993
You blame me
'cause you're still in The Ridge?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.461
Still mowing lawns?

19:25.564 --> 19:26.895
- Hey!
- No, no, no. No, no!

19:26.965 --> 19:29.866
Lkey, it's fine. No.
Yeah, I left, Eddie.

19:29.935 --> 19:33.871
You stayed because you wanted to.
Because this is where you rule.

19:33.939 --> 19:37.807
Everyone remembers touchdowns you
scored, the cheerleaders you deflowered.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.810
- You don't know.
- You wanted to stay.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.608
Things got all turned around,
made it into my fault.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.208
You got that stuck, Eddie,
'cause you chose to get stuck.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.446
Eddie! Hey, cut it out!

19:48.554 --> 19:49.987
Eddie!

20:07.472 --> 20:08.905
Ow! Dad.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.202
Sorry.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.368
[Ronny] Eddie really
did a number on you.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.174
Does this mean
no more Best Friend Windows?

20:15.247 --> 20:18.307
I don't know what it means.
Ow! This is a cut, not a sprain.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.647
Here, let me. Let me.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.949
[Phone ringing]

20:26.558 --> 20:28.287
It's Aubrey.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.160
How you doing?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.597
<i>L was just calling to say
that L'm gonna bounce</i>

20:34.666 --> 20:37.191
back to Berkeley for a couple weeks.

20:37.269 --> 20:41.399
- Aubrey, please. Let's talk.
- No, this is what's right.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.237
- It's what I need to do.
- Aubrey, I...

20:44.309 --> 20:48.075
Listen, I gotta pack.
The cab is coming in a few hours

20:48.146 --> 20:50.171
and I haven't even started.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.808
- Goodbye, Nick.
- Just...

20:53.885 --> 20:55.147
[dial tone]

21:07.332 --> 21:08.822
Gotcha!

21:11.303 --> 21:13.328
Um, I'm kinda busy.

21:13.405 --> 21:16.533
The whole town's buzzin'
about your friend, Freaky Phil?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.236
Is he really gonna do it,
leave the house?

21:19.311 --> 21:21.336
What did you want to talk about?

21:23.548 --> 21:25.413
Big, sweet Owen.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.714
Affable. Do you know that word?

21:28.587 --> 21:30.919
It was on the twins' homework
the other day,

21:30.989 --> 21:33.355
automatically thought of you.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.622
It means warm, friendly, pleasant.

21:40.265 --> 21:42.597
Exactly the type of guy
who shouldn't have

21:42.668 --> 21:45.831
what I'm about to tell you
happening to him.

21:48.173 --> 21:49.401
What?

21:55.013 --> 21:57.777
It's just practice.
It's just practice, baby.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.583
We talking about practice.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.329
[Phone ringing]

22:15.767 --> 22:17.291
Hello?

22:17.369 --> 22:20.236
Whoa, Owen, slow down a second.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.863
What?

22:21.940 --> 22:25.034
What are you talk... whoa. No.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.840
That can't be, Owen. Owen?

22:27.913 --> 22:29.574
Owen!

22:30.148 --> 22:31.308
Hello?

22:31.416 --> 22:34.510
- What goes on?
- You're not gonna believe this.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.591
You all right?

22:49.701 --> 22:53.330
I have... no home, Nicky.

22:54.940 --> 22:58.068
- None.
- Whoa. Whoa, what's going on?

22:58.910 --> 23:00.434
Big Cat...

23:00.512 --> 23:03.640
...he told me the worst thing.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.878
- The worst thing I've ever heard.
- What did he say?

23:06.952 --> 23:08.317
Alison.

23:09.421 --> 23:13.187
My Alison... and lkey.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.287
They've been together.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.589
Together, Nicky.
How could this be?

23:21.666 --> 23:24.499
- Did you ask Alison?
- Yeah. I asked her.

23:24.569 --> 23:28.198
I told her, "Ray Cataldo says
you've been sleeping with lkey.

23:28.273 --> 23:29.501
Isn't that funny?"

23:29.574 --> 23:31.906
- And you wanna know what she did?
- What?

23:31.977 --> 23:35.208
Laundry. It's what she does
when she's scared and nervous.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.646
- She does laundry.
- Laundry?

23:37.749 --> 23:41.310
How can this be, Nicky? How can this be?

23:43.688 --> 23:45.246
[Tires squealing]

23:50.595 --> 23:51.755
What up?

23:51.830 --> 23:53.730
- Is it true?
- What?

23:53.799 --> 23:57.530
You and Alison.
One word answer, right now.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.036
- Psshh.
- Don't lie to me, man.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.805
Yeah. It's true.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.816
We're done, me and you.

24:13.885 --> 24:17.651
We don't work together,
we're not friends. We're done.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.953
- Eddie! Come on!
- All this time, lkey!

24:21.026 --> 24:24.928
We rode together, worked together,
drank together and you're doing this?

24:24.996 --> 24:27.157
If I woulda told you,
you woulda killed me.

24:27.232 --> 24:29.792
I'm still gonna kill you.
I swear to God.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.064
There is nothin' I can think
worse than what you've done.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.230
Nothin'!

24:48.220 --> 24:50.916
How can I be in the same room as her?

24:50.989 --> 24:53.958
And how can I watch her hold the kids?

24:54.025 --> 24:57.256
And the kids... Nicky.
I love them so much, but now...

24:57.329 --> 24:58.887
- Look...
- How could this be?

24:58.964 --> 25:01.660
You're angry and
you have every right to be, but...

25:06.705 --> 25:10.038
It's him, isn't it?

25:10.108 --> 25:14.738
- Owen.
- Don't make me talk to him, Nicky.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.873
- Please don't make me talk to him now.
- Ikey, not now.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.440
- You got every right to beat me soft.
- Go home.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.977
I know you can never forgive me.
And I'm gonna have to live with that.

25:24.055 --> 25:27.183
With losing the best friend
I ever had, losing all my friends.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.422
But Alison, she loves you.

25:31.796 --> 25:35.095
You can't let this thing
finish that thing.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.869
And we already ended what we had.
Nicky, he helped me see the light.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.769
Ikey, lkey... shh.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.240
You knew?

25:51.449 --> 25:53.747
This whole time?

25:58.657 --> 26:01.558
And he was all over me
to do what's right.

26:03.228 --> 26:08.188
Ray Cataldo, of all people, has the
decency to tell me what goes on,

26:08.266 --> 26:10.928
but you didn't?
How can this be?

26:15.473 --> 26:17.839
How can this be?

26:20.745 --> 26:22.406
Owen. O...

26:25.717 --> 26:27.048
[door shuts]

26:36.461 --> 26:38.122
Let me get a draft.

26:38.196 --> 26:41.359
- I thought we agreed, Eddie.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

26:41.466 --> 26:44.731
The thing is, Janet,

26:44.803 --> 26:47.704
this is my bar.
This is where I go.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.935
If you don't like it,
go work at the Johnson Inn.

27:03.088 --> 27:04.919
What's your tweak?

27:05.924 --> 27:09.223
My friends, they're marching morons.
Every last one of them.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.159
Just big, fat disappointments.

27:11.229 --> 27:14.164
What'd they do, neglect
to pick you up for a barbeque?

27:14.899 --> 27:18.130
- Can I just finish my beer?
- Sure.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.969
By the way, Eddie,

27:25.043 --> 27:29.537
I've always found the best way around
a disappointment is forgiveness.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.376
So, then when are you gonna get around
to forgiving me?

27:36.888 --> 27:42.326
Hey, dude, I preach but
I'm not so hot at the practicing part.

27:47.799 --> 27:53.135
Hey, um, something occurred to me
on the drive over here today.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.971
What's occurred to you, Eddie?

28:02.681 --> 28:07.641
That I am basically a sad person.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.144
- You?
- I am.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.220
I'm a sad person.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.187
But then I was thinking about you.

28:20.231 --> 28:25.259
And the way you smile
and the way that starts in your eyes

28:25.336 --> 28:29.295
and then spreads across the rest
of your face, like a rush of ink.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.302
And I was thinking
about how when I see you

28:33.378 --> 28:35.539
or I hear your voice on the phone,

28:37.816 --> 28:39.647
I think to myself,

28:41.953 --> 28:44.649
"Oh, goodie, now the fun begins."

28:44.723 --> 28:48.420
- "Oh, goodie, now the fun begins?"
- Yeah.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.988
And I was thinking that...

28:55.533 --> 28:59.697
...when I'm with you,
that I am not sad anymore.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.331
I gotta go make sure Owen's all right,

29:33.471 --> 29:36.702
but when I get back,
I wanna see you, Janet...

29:38.076 --> 29:40.636
...really see you.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.308
Will you let me do that?

29:46.451 --> 29:49.011
I've gone and tumbled for you, Eddie.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.817
So I guess... yeah.
Yeah. I'll let you do that.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.804
Hey, uh, by the way...

30:15.513 --> 30:17.947
- You were twirlin'.
- No. I wasn't.

30:18.016 --> 30:22.146
I, um, I just...
I was trying to... catch a horsefly

30:22.220 --> 30:24.916
and... did you...
did you want something... else?

30:24.989 --> 30:28.015
No. No, I was just, uh...

30:28.092 --> 30:30.253
...hoping to catch you in a twirl.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.803
Owen... Owen?

30:43.074 --> 30:44.803
He's gone.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.642
Gone where?

30:47.745 --> 30:52.114
He grabbed a case of Irish whiskey
left over from my birthday party

30:52.217 --> 30:55.653
and all of his Bruce Springsteen
and Bob Seger CDs,

30:56.487 --> 30:58.955
- and then he left.
- Where did he go?

30:59.023 --> 31:02.390
I'm sure he went to Jersey,
to his brother's.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.950
Big Boy Brett?

31:04.028 --> 31:06.496
It's where he always goes
when he's upset.

31:06.564 --> 31:10.227
- Big Boy Brett used to be trouble.
- Big Boy Brett still is trouble.

31:10.301 --> 31:13.737
Last time Owen went down there,
they ended up almost going to jail.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.966
The time before that,
they did go to jail.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.907
Now, don't tell me
you didn't see this coming.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.939
Bring him back to me, Nick.

31:24.749 --> 31:28.981
I know I have no right,
no right in the world.

31:29.053 --> 31:32.386
I've been doing an awful thing
for a long time.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.556
But I knew,
the minute Owen walked in here,

31:35.627 --> 31:38.994
and I saw his furious face,

31:39.063 --> 31:41.725
that he's the one for me.

31:41.799 --> 31:45.895
Do you know how demented that sounds,
Alison, even for you?

31:46.671 --> 31:49.162
I know I want him back.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.607
I know you don't owe me a thing

31:52.710 --> 31:55.611
and I know you don't
like me at all.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.649
But I'm begging you.

32:02.453 --> 32:06.753
I'll bring him back, but not for you.
I'm bringing him back for us.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.291
Whatever it takes.

32:12.163 --> 32:15.530
You only get one shot
at this kind of thing, Nick.

32:15.633 --> 32:18.158
That is all that I'm sure of.

32:18.236 --> 32:21.364
You make a terrible mistake,

32:21.439 --> 32:23.999
you only get one shot to make it right.

32:24.108 --> 32:28.272
<i>[# Mychael Blue: Gold]</i>

33:30.041 --> 33:31.338
Nick.

33:31.409 --> 33:34.572
[Panting]

33:34.645 --> 33:36.135
What are you doing here?

33:37.415 --> 33:41.681
Everything about this place
reminded me of my mother, everything.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.381
Her memory haunted it all.

33:44.455 --> 33:48.323
But when I left here and I put some
distance between myself and the Ridge,

33:48.393 --> 33:49.860
it got easier.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.987
But just the thought of me
coming back here, to the pain of it,

33:53.064 --> 33:54.964
it kept me away.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.593
It's indefensible, I know. I know.

33:57.702 --> 34:02.036
But I was a kid and I was grieving.
And...

34:02.106 --> 34:05.041
I was dumb. I lost my way.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.406
- OK, Nick...
- No, no.

34:06.477 --> 34:07.603
Please.

34:07.678 --> 34:12.308
What I remember is you barefoot,
in your prom dress,

34:12.382 --> 34:17.013
pumping gas into my truck,
laughing beneath a lipstick sky.

34:18.289 --> 34:21.053
- Remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

34:21.159 --> 34:26.119
- I hated that truck.
- Look, those years are gone.

34:26.230 --> 34:30.063
And I didn't plan on coming back here
and causing you any pain,

34:30.134 --> 34:34.297
but I didn't expect on meeting Sam,

34:34.405 --> 34:37.498
and I didn't expect
to have these feelings for you.

34:38.443 --> 34:42.208
The moment I saw you, ten years later,
it was just so obvious to me

34:42.313 --> 34:46.647
that it's like I'd been starving.
All these years, I didn't even know it.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.277
It's not about
whether I'm Sam's father or not.

34:49.353 --> 34:52.447
Or whether it's this Gavin Goddard guy
that you speak of. No.

34:52.523 --> 34:55.549
Coming back here,
the only thing that matters

34:55.626 --> 34:59.187
is that I want you guys in my life.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.426
I can see that now.

35:02.533 --> 35:07.061
I guess what it comes down to is
maybe you really do only get one shot.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.468
Maybe that's
the unreasonable beauty of things.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.271
The unreasonable beauty of things?

35:13.344 --> 35:17.474
No matter. The singular truth.
The incontrovertible reality.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.277
Yes?

35:19.350 --> 35:23.787
We all fall in love sometimes.
You know?

35:23.855 --> 35:27.757
- Nick, can we talk about this later?
- [Door opens]

35:30.962 --> 35:35.797
Nick Garrett, this is Gavin Goddard.
Gavin Goddard, this is Nick Garrett.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.473
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I was a huge fan of your book.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.168
- Gavin, please.
- What? It's fact.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.676
I gave it to all my friends.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.508
I was living in the city
and I really connected to it.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.674
I love how you described
the Ground-Zero-clean-up noise

35:52.750 --> 35:56.117
as the, uh, "clanging measures
of a discordant hopelessness

35:56.187 --> 36:00.920
that rattle around like the imprecise
certainty of a howl in a haunted house".

36:00.992 --> 36:03.517
It's just...
It was really great stuff, man.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.152
Thanks.

36:05.263 --> 36:08.323
And I'll tell you, what
you just said to Hannah, that was...

36:08.399 --> 36:10.697
- Gavin. Stop.
- That was nice thoughts, man.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.293
The unreasonable beauty of things?
I love that.

36:13.371 --> 36:18.206
I don't know what it means, but...
I know it's a special sentiment.

36:19.143 --> 36:23.978
You're a word man, Nick.
As a numbers guy, I admire that.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.177
- This needn't be awkward.
- Uh, no.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.656
Hey.
You meet Gavin?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.726
Yeah. I did.

36:40.765 --> 36:44.701
Doesn't look much like a flying
pomegranate made of gold, huh?

36:44.769 --> 36:47.135
Oh, um, that one's in the shop.
Right, Gavin?

36:47.238 --> 36:51.072
- Yeah, if you say so, Sammy.
- Nick, this isn't what you think.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.705
I don't know what I think,

36:55.780 --> 36:59.147
except that I gotta go
take care of a friend, but, um...

37:01.219 --> 37:03.744
...you guys take care.

37:03.821 --> 37:07.587
- Nice to meet you, Nick.
- Gavin.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.741
<i>[# Southside Johnny:

38:00.044 --> 38:02.410
Hi, I need a delivery.

38:02.480 --> 38:07.247
Four large pepperoni pies

38:07.318 --> 38:09.980
to 34 Gelson Road.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.248
And I need them there
within a half an hour, please.

38:15.626 --> 38:16.854
Thank you.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.956
Now, what are you doing here?

38:50.027 --> 38:52.393
I hear you're going after Owen.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.729
- I'm comin' with you.
- I can handle it.

38:58.803 --> 39:00.361
Yeah, I'm sure you can,

39:00.438 --> 39:04.340
but I'm not letting you leave town
a second time, Nicky.

39:04.408 --> 39:08.037
Not alone. Not without me.
