WEBVTT

00:39.920 --> 00:41.069
- You bought this?
- Yeah.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.593
And it's ours now. We own this.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.431
- I love it.
Right?

00:52.520 --> 00:55.512
What'd I tell you?
The fireplace, the built-ins here.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.591
Are you sure you want
to give this to your sister?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.830
Babe, we'd make 100K
oft this flip all day long.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.896
- Trying to make up...
- This is it?

01:01.920 --> 01:03.148
Hey, yeah. Come in.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.836
You guys made me ask off
an hour early to see this dump?

01:06.960 --> 01:10.430
- We're all smelling this right now, right?
- It smells like I'm breathing piss.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.317
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.152
- Come on.
- Come on, have a little vision.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.559
French doors to the garden.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.279
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.271
create an open concept
through the kitchen.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.828
There's a gorgeous stained glass
here in the corner.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.148
The bones are really good.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.676
When's the part we cough up 12 grand
to fix the rotted-out foundation?

01:27.760 --> 01:30.228
Clearly, it's not for them.
Let's just flip this one, El.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.759
There's a park across the street.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.070
And the schools here are fantastic
if you have a baby.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.676
When. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.273
When. When you have a baby.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.033
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.674
You see that? That's called
manifesting to the universe.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.992
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny
if I drop $26,000 on in vitro first.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.150
- You're a dick.
- I'm kidding.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.710
If this place is so great,
why don't you guys move in here?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.229
What are they gonna do
with five bedrooms and a park?

01:56.320 --> 01:57.720
Theyre obviously never having kids.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.856
Look at 'em. They don't have
any emotional holes to fill.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.677
Not that we are doing it to fill...

02:01.760 --> 02:03.318
- Shut up, Russ.
- All right.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.118
- What was that look?
- What look?

02:08.080 --> 02:10.071
And you did a definite look.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.550
What was the look for? You looked at me
to include me in your look.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.056
- I didn't do a look.
- Totally did a look.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.016
- It wasn't a look.
- I think we just started some trouble.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.720
- There's no trouble.
- Maybe even a fight.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.456
- There's no fight. There's no trouble.
- Let's get out of here. Come on.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.313
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna
have kids now, aren't you?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.755
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.656
Of course you are.
You have to win at everything.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.736
Then you'll throw your perfect uterus
in my face, too.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.576
How do you know my uterus is perfect?
We've never even tried to have kids.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.196
- I don't know if I can get pregnant.
- Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.113
- Kimmy.
- It probably has a leather interior.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.430
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.272
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.429
See you later, Russ.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.736
- I didn't do a look.
- You're doing a look right now.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.796
There's no look. You're doing a look.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.391
All right, maybe I did do a look,

03:01.480 --> 03:03.516
but just hearing him say it out loud:

03:03.600 --> 03:06.592
We're never having children.
I mean, is that true?

03:07.040 --> 03:10.271
I quit bringing it up. Every time I did,
you'd say it's not the right time.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.910
I know, but we were always so broke.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.912
And then we were going crazy
trying to get the business started.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.709
We've flipped five houses this year,
and I'm starting to turn down design work.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.230
I always thought
that I'd be a mom someday.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.874
- I think I'm ready.
- Great.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.760
Now you're ready
and by the time the kid's 16,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.673
I'm going to be one of those old dads,
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.351
- Hey, Dad.
- What's up, Son?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.396
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.349
Dad?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.873
You killed my dad!

03:47.960 --> 03:49.791
Hey, Dad, wake up.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.556
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.553
And you're not that old.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.676
Here's an idea.
What if we adopt a five-year-old?

03:57.760 --> 04:00.479
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36.
How about that?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.638
Keep your end straight, will you?

04:09.720 --> 04:12.792
Look, you're overthinking it, bro.
None of my kids were planned.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.155
Kid shows up, you figure it out.
Easy-peasy.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.676
- How many kids you got now, Stu?
- Numberfour's in the oven right now.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.398
- Wow.
- Nothing hard about kids.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.720
As long as you spend some time
with them, they/re oool.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.399
Most important thing,
make sure the moms all get along.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.469
Meatball. Hey, buddy.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.189
Hey. You miss me?

04:37.280 --> 04:39.919
That's my boy. You missed me, huh?
I missed you, too.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.833
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.878
Hey, El. I got the towel samples
you wanted for the kitchen.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
El, you okay?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.638
Hey, what's the matter?

04:53.200 --> 04:57.113
Nothing. I was just thinking about what
you said about adopting a five-year-old.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.474
- I said that?
- Yeah.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.199
- I was totally... I was joking.
- I know. It's kind of crazy.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.357
But it just got me thinking.
And there's so many kids in foster care,

05:04.440 --> 05:07.671
and they're moving from place to place,
and they don't have anybody,

05:07.760 --> 05:09.576
and it's like the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.876
And I found this adoption agency.
Theyre having an orientation next week.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.798
No, don't show me that.
I don't want to see those little faces.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.080
You trying to break my heart?
I just got home from work.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.192
Ellie, people who take in foster kids
are really special.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.856
These are the kind of people who volunteer
when it's not even a holiday.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.711
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.519
What if there was a disaster?

05:28.640 --> 05:30.198
- What, like a dirty bomb?
- Whatever.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.033
And there's a little kid
who ends up on our doorstep.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.317
Are we gonna turn her away
because we're not special enough?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.228
That would depend.
There's a lot of factors that go into it.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.357
I mean, our food rations.
The blast radius.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.399
El, you can't take some
offhanded remark I made

05:46.480 --> 05:48.357
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.668
It was a joke.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Yeah.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.031
I know. I just...

05:55.720 --> 05:58.640
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed
into something you don't want to do.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.352
It was just a nice thought.

06:02.920 --> 06:03.955
Good night.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.954
All right, I won't make
any more jokes like that.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
All right?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.436
Hey, you want to watch
a little Fixer Upper?

06:17.080 --> 06:19.435
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.837
Oh, God.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.713
It's not fair. That is not...

07:44.680 --> 07:45.795
Hey.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.193
You can't buy these pita chips anymore.
They're way too spicy.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.719
I'm getting my nose watery and...

07:55.680 --> 07:59.195
Over a half million children
are currently in foster care.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.033
The system is overloaded, okay?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.678
It doesn't need any more kids.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.116
So, for a child to be removed,
conditions have to be pretty bleak,

08:07.440 --> 08:10.398
usually involving abuse
or extreme neglect.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.552
And some of these kids
can often languish in the system,

08:13.680 --> 08:17.070
unless a wonderful family
like yours steps up for them.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.879
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.758
Perfect. Let me go check in back,
see what we have in stock.

08:24.080 --> 08:28.437
She is kidding, of course.
We do not stock.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.556
And you know that.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.188
But we can take you through
the eight-week foster parenting course,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.918
and you can get your certification.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.719
And then we can pairyou
with some kids that you can foster

08:38.799 --> 08:40.518
until they become adoptable.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.830
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.748
These kids will test yourwill,

08:45.840 --> 08:48.400
put a strain on your relationship

08:48.480 --> 08:50.914
and push buttons
you didn't even know you had.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.197
Now, I can tell by looking at you
that not all y'all are gonna make it.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.795
I actually think this group
has got the grit

08:57.880 --> 08:59.791
to face some unpleasant...

08:59.880 --> 09:02.952
- Excuse me.
- You guys heading out?

09:03.040 --> 09:05.679
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.470
- All right, that one's on me.
- It absolutely is.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.232
- We've gone over this before.
- We have.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.828
- This is a problem.
- It's a problem. Okay, everybody,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.478
why don't we learn your names

09:14.560 --> 09:16.630
and what type of children
you're looking for.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.789
Hi.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.153
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

09:21.240 --> 09:26.314
And the Lord has guided us here
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.551
Yeah, the big guy,
he's blessed us with so much.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.154
We'd just like to share it
with a child that needs a home.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.390
- Yeah.
- What about over here?

09:34.480 --> 09:37.153
I'm David and this is my wife, Jessie.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.152
And we've been trying to have a baby
for three years now.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.674
But no matter what we do,

09:42.760 --> 09:43.954
I can't...

09:44.600 --> 09:47.319
- I'm sorry. Can someone else go?
- It's okay.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.910
It's okay.
Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.389
We've also been trying to oonceive now,

09:53.480 --> 09:55.436
pretty much since
the first night we met, right?

09:56.520 --> 09:59.273
That is correct.
We're just not having any luck.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.239
Anyway, we're looking for a child of any
gender or ethnicity up to nine years old.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.519
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.754
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy

10:12.880 --> 10:16.998
who I can help to reach his full
Division One scholarship potential.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.672
Preferably African-American.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.073
Right! Like The Blind Side.
Like the movie, right? That's great.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.958
Honey, she's not joking.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.757
You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.799
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys'
conceiving joke, that we were...

10:34.880 --> 10:37.394
I mean, that is the plot
of The Blind Side, so...

10:37.480 --> 10:40.074
I've never seen it,
so, please, it's your turn.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.192
- Just do not talk to me anymore.
- Yeah, she's nuts.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.552
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I...

10:48.200 --> 10:51.795
So, my name's Ellie. Hi.
This is my husband, Pete.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.470
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not too sure about any of this.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.916
I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball,
and we love him like crazy, but...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.275
- Don't compare kids to dogs.
- I'm not.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.216
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma
about getting a dog from the pound,

11:03.240 --> 11:05.629
but now they're called rescue dogs
and everybody wants one.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.790
Don't say "pound",
don't say "dog". Just don't.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.518
Okay, no, that's not...

11:09.600 --> 11:11.591
It's just all of this
is a little scary, right?

11:11.680 --> 11:13.955
- But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
- Oh, my God.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.200
Instead of foster kids,
more people would be into it

11:16.240 --> 11:18.521
and people wouldn't walk out
in the middle of your seminar

11:18.560 --> 11:20.994
- and it'd be good for your program.
- Pete!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.480
- I'm just saying...
- Just stop it!

11:22.520 --> 11:27.116
Everyone, our guest speaker of the day,
Brenda Fernandez, and her parents.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.031
Let's make them feel welcome.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.157
Hey, thank you.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.634
Hi.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.279
So, when I was eight years old,

11:40.360 --> 11:41.952
my mom and her boyfriend

11:42.040 --> 11:45.874
decided it would be a good idea
to build a meth lab in our garage.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.791
They made me deliver drugs for them.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.389
They abused me physically,

11:49.520 --> 11:51.909
and some of their customers
abused me sexually.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.271
When I was 11,

11:54.400 --> 11:57.198
our garage exploded,
and I was put in the system.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.915
Bounced around
from placement to placement.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.558
Pretty soon I was 14.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.875
Nobody wants a teenager,
so I'd be aging out in a few years.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.916
The thing is, over half the kids
who age out of foster care

12:10.040 --> 12:14.352
end up homeless, addicted,
incarcerated or dead within two years.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.675
That was gonna be me.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.069
Trying to start my adult life,

12:19.160 --> 12:22.038
but with no family
to help me pick a college,

12:22.120 --> 12:24.111
nobody to come home to on the holidays

12:24.200 --> 12:27.749
or cry to when my first boyfriend
dumped me for Missy Howard.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.757
But then those two...
very special people came along.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.831
And I didn't make it easy on them.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.594
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

12:41.120 --> 12:45.511
they were always there,
with a sack lunch and a ride.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.272
Thanks, you guys.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.640
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.868
I am so sorry
about the Blind Side comment.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.552
I love the movie.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.392
Bye, Brenda. Great job, amazing.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.869
Kit, bye.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.111
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy.
Bye, guys. Hey.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.629
- So now you think we're special enough?
- Maybe we are.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.358
I mean, this is what we do.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.318
We see potential in things,
we fix 'em up. Like they did.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.595
They find this kid
in a state of disrepair,

13:34.680 --> 13:37.176
they give her a new coat of paint,
scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,

13:37.200 --> 13:40.556
install some countertops in the form
of love or self-esteem, whatever.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.552
I'm not saying she's a house
like I said the dog thing in there,

13:43.640 --> 13:45.040
but I think we're perfect for this.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.389
But she's really not a house, Pete.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.616
I just said she's not a house.
Are you listening to me?

13:49.640 --> 13:50.834
Okay. No, lam.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.558
I'm so excited. Are you excited?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.311
I just get worried

13:55.400 --> 13:59.154
that you think things are gonna be easier
than they actually are.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.878
- What? I do not.
- You do.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.032
This whole thing was your idea.
Now I'm pumped about it, and you're not?

14:04.120 --> 14:05.473
No, lam pumped.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.616
- You don't look pumped.
- I am.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.074
A big, life-altering moment like this,
you gotta get pumped.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.600
We're about to do something insane.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.000
- It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
- I know.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.160
- Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw".
- Yee-haw.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.316
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
Louder. Crazier.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.914
Come on. You're about to be a mom.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.476
- Add a balloon, El.
- Okay, have a seat.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.709
Time's up.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.114
These are your fantasy kids.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.350
They are not your real children.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.190
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.356
Pete. Tick-tock, muscle man.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.637
That's not gonna bring him back from
that peanut butter sandwich you fed him.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.992
- Your real kids will be very different.
- Can't erase 'em.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.077
Good job, Michael.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.272
All right, October.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.430
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

15:11.960 --> 15:12.995
All there?

15:14.240 --> 15:17.198
Time to erase these ideals right now.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.960
Almost done.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.838
- Almost done.
- Okay. Okay.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.831
Thank you. Thank you.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.069
Thank you.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.030
All right, everybody,

15:33.160 --> 15:38.393
I want you all to imagine
you got this plush new job.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.876
They give you a nice big office.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.798
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine

15:43.920 --> 15:46.120
- right there in the break room.
- I love frozen yogurt.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.632
But deep down,
you know you're not qualified.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.279
In your heart of hearts,

15:54.360 --> 15:55.759
you know you're not good enough

15:56.080 --> 15:59.117
and you are going to get fired.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.277
The same way you got fired
from your last three jobs.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.519
And you might quit
just to get some control back.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.512
Hell, you might even tip over
that damn yogurt machine

16:10.600 --> 16:12.192
and walk your ass right out of there.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.759
Just to clarify,

16:14.200 --> 16:17.988
Karen is not advocating vandalism
in the workplace.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.072
The point is, that it's the same...

16:23.160 --> 16:25.037
for a displaced child

16:26.000 --> 16:29.117
who knows that you don't want her.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.434
Except instead of grieving

16:33.000 --> 16:34.672
the loss of a job...

16:35.680 --> 16:38.911
she's losing her connection

16:39.240 --> 16:41.674
with everything and everyone.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.471
But the one connection that can remain

16:46.120 --> 16:48.190
is between siblings.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.352
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

16:54.040 --> 16:58.636
You might want to consider upgrading
to a sibling set.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.155
Dirk?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.438
Would you consider siblings?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.271
The big guy might smile on that.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.319
Yeah, he would. We'd have to...

17:08.400 --> 17:10.356
- We'd pray on that.
- Yeah.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.270
Pray on it.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.714
The Big Guy wouldn't give you
any more than you can handle.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.790
I beg to differ.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.153
- Pete. Ellie.
- Hey.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.639
- You made it.
- Hi.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.237
Sign in, and take this form with you

17:36.320 --> 17:39.096
and write down the name of any kid
you meet you might be interested in.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.270
Really? That's how this works?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.828
Yeah, it can feel a little
like shopping for kids.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.070
It's messed up, I know,
but the county puts these on

17:46.160 --> 17:48.993
because they can match
a lot of kids and parents quickly.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.230
God, look at the big kids over there.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.914
Breaks my heart.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.560
Most folks want nothing
to do with teenagers.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.030
Of course, if you two thought
you could make room for an older child...

18:00.120 --> 18:03.157
- I mean...
- l... Oh, God.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.516
I'm so sorry. We are terrible people.
I'm sorry.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.715
You're not terrible.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.190
Get on in there and find a family, go on.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.952
God, it's so weird.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.790
Normally, you go out and chat up some
random kid in a park and you get arrested.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.836
- Now we're just supposed to?
- I know.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.835
This little guy's all by himself.
You want to go say hi?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.353
Yeah. Okay.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.513
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- So sorry, occupied. Sorry.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.036
We just went to get treats
so, yeah, just back it up.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.031
Hey, look, we got some snacks.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.678
Come on, Lucas, right over here.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.711
Hey. Excuse me. Heads up.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
Okay.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.519
Never mind, thanks.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.953
You just take it and try
to throw it into his mouth.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.473
Really. You want to have a go?

18:53.720 --> 18:54.994
Nice to meet you.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.632
- Get it?
- Oh, yeah. Bring her in.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.236
Whoa!

18:59.320 --> 19:01.311
Hey. You gotta wait for yourtum, buddy.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.069
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just go.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.513
Pete. Ellie.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.079
- How's it going?
- Hey.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.515
Yeah, well... It's a little weird.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.591
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.229
But did you meet any kids
that you're curious about?

19:22.320 --> 19:25.835
We met one little girl
who was sitting all by herself.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.878
Very sweet, a little guarded.
Kind of had a little wall around her.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.033
Really small for her age, too.
Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or something.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.237
I saw her... Right there.
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

19:36.360 --> 19:38.616
who seems like she's been chained
to a radiator half her life.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.074
- That's my daughter.
- The radiator kid?

19:41.960 --> 19:42.790
What?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.916
Yeah, that's my daughter.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.274
I'm so sorry.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.749
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm really proud of her.

19:48.840 --> 19:53.118
The reason she's sitting away from others
is because she has a family,

19:53.200 --> 19:54.872
a very happy family.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.428
And I didn't drink a drop
when I was pregnant.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.112
Nor do I have a radiator.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.794
- Of course. You should be really proud.
- I am.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.680
Know what? I'm sick of looking at that.
To hell with it. I'm going over there.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.193
Pete. Hey, Pete.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.108
- Pete, what are you doing?
- Look at them over there.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.395
Everybody's avoiding them
like they're dipped in shit.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.597
- I'm just gonna go say hi.
- Okay, hey. Pete, just wait.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.399
I know. I think it's awful.
But they're teenagers, okay/.7

20:24.480 --> 20:26.471
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

20:26.560 --> 20:28.471
and watch people playing
video games on YouTube.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.680
We're not equipped for that.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.936
- What for? I'm just going to say hello.
- I know. I don't think we should do that.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.349
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.714
Hi.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.030
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

20:40.040 --> 20:44.238
"Dipped in shit," "masturbate," so forth.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.032
We appreciate the concern,
but there's no need to go all pity crazy.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.473
We know how this works.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.238
So just go on. It's okay.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.710
Go mingle with the kiddies
and don't give it another thought, okay/.7

20:54.800 --> 20:57.598
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.877
So, you two went out and found
yourself a teenager after all.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.554
- We only met her for a second.
- But she made a real impression.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.631
Oh, yeah. Lizzys such a great kid.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.557
She does really well in school.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.119
Come on back.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.192
She came into care four years ago
when she was 11.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.909
It took a lot to convince her to accept
placement in an adoptive home.

21:33.000 --> 21:33.830
Her mother...

21:33.920 --> 21:35.936
Set the house on fire,
passed out with a crack pipe.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.394
- What I was gonna say...
- Before I told it like it is?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.471
Before you jumped on in there,

21:40.560 --> 21:43.870
is that her mother's made
a lot of promises over the years

21:43.960 --> 21:45.791
and never seems
to follow through with them.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.108
Where's her mom now?

21:47.240 --> 21:49.708
Probably in an orange jumpsuit
selling smokes in the yard.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.268
I'm sure that's not accurate.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.796
Turns out Lizzy's mom is
finishing a sentence in county jail.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.797
Who called it? Who said it?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.194
- You did.
- Yeah.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.160
Looks like she's never
pursued reunification

22:04.240 --> 22:06.071
or contacted her kids in over two years,

22:06.160 --> 22:08.276
so, yeah, she's pretty much a non-issue.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.113
That's terrible. What about the father?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.070
What are you talking about, "father"?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.599
What, are you doing comedy
for us now, Pete?

22:19.680 --> 22:23.036
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers
who've stepped up,

22:23.120 --> 22:26.669
but, in this case, no ID's
on any birth fathers.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.149
Look, Lizzy's mom
is a product of the system.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.119
She never learned to properly care
for herself, much less three kids.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.350
- Three? Three kids?
- Yeah, three.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.271
- Yeah, Lizzy...
- At once?

22:37.360 --> 22:41.956
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two
younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.508
Wait, so we would have... three children?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.034
No. Two maybe,
but there's no way we can do three.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.599
I mean, we wanted to meet...

22:48.720 --> 22:50.278
Oh, my gosh.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.590
- Why would you show us that?
- You're an asshole.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.036
Why would you even show that?
Theyre so cute. That's wrong.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.156
Listen, we're not gonna
sugarcoat it, okay?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.118
Lite is a wild, rowdy kid,

23:01.200 --> 23:04.237
and Juan can be fragile
and a little emotional,

23:04.360 --> 23:08.353
and Lizzy is strong-willed
and she won't trust easily.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.635
- God, can you blame her?
- No, but listen.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.278
We wouldn't recommend this match

23:12.360 --> 23:15.750
if we didn't believe
that with some structure and love

23:15.840 --> 23:18.798
these kids could blossom, right?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.997
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them
out of their current foster placement.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.958
- The Muskies might lose that meal ticket.
- Karen, please.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.909
Most of our foster parents
are really terrific, caring people.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.992
And, yes, there are people
who do it just for the paycheck.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.152
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.310
- Just maybe a little...
- lnbred.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.039
- Karen, there is no evidence to...
- You've seen 'em.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.760
I swear they look like brother and sister.
I can't tell them apart.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.633
In any case,
I'd love to set up a visitation,

23:47.720 --> 23:49.676
unless you have any other concerns?

23:49.760 --> 23:52.115
It's just a visitation. So...

23:52.240 --> 23:55.710
It's just... Is it a problem, you know,
the whole white savior thing?

23:56.680 --> 23:58.910
- Like the Avatar thing.
- Avatar'?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.280
How the blue guys couldn't fight off
the unobtanium guys,

24:01.360 --> 24:03.760
until the white guy showed up
and pretended to be a blue guy?

24:03.840 --> 24:07.992
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple
taking in little Latin kids.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.040
Are people gonna think
we shouldn't be doing that?

24:10.080 --> 24:13.470
You know what? We'll go ahead
and toss these kids back into the system

24:13.560 --> 24:15.710
and I'll justjot you down
for "whites only'.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.758
- Come on. I didn't mean...
- Heyl No, that's not...

24:18.840 --> 24:20.880
Don't write "whites only'.
That's not what he meant.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.109
Not at all what I meant.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.794
Pete, I appreciate
your cultural sensitivity,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.997
but we have every color
of kid in the system.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.594
- And we have every color of parent.
- Every color.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.717
- Just not nearly enough.
- Not nearly enough parents.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.520
And listen,
you're gonna get some funny looks.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.955
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.997
But if you're willing to love these kids
who need a mom and dad

24:43.080 --> 24:44.536
and somebody has a problem with that?

24:44.560 --> 24:47.393
You just ask 'em how many
goddamn kids they've adopted.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.959
- Exactly.
- Hell.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.476
Shoot.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.711
All right. I just wanted to have
the Avatar talk, now we did, so I'm good.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.028
Fantastic.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.156
- You ready to meet three kids?
- Three kids.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.549
- All right.
Well set it up.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.756
Hey. How's it going?

25:06.280 --> 25:08.475
Good. It's going really good.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.518
- Pete and Ellie.
- Yeah, we know. Come on in.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.279
Good luck with that one.
She thinks she's better than everybody.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.238
Yeah. The other two are
jackassing around out back.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.673
We'll be in the shop.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.034
- Hey, Lizzy.
- How are you?

25:31.120 --> 25:32.155
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.355
Ellie and Pete.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.876
- You don't have to call us the Wagners.
- No, please. Good to...

25:36.960 --> 25:40.350
- Sorry about them.
- Please.

25:40.440 --> 25:43.079
- They just seem a little...
- Like brother and sister?

25:43.160 --> 25:45.799
Pipe down with that crap.
We are not friggin' related.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.757
Friggin' related.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.034
I'm really gonna miss them.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.798
- That is, if you...
- No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.896
You made such a good impression on us
when we met you,

25:54.920 --> 25:58.629
- we wanted to get to know you a bit more.
- Yes, and meet your brother and sister.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.156
- Theyre right outside, if you follow me.
- Yes.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.240
Okay.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.355
Juan.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.715
Lita.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.637
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.039
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.872
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

26:16.760 --> 26:20.116
Well, we met your sister,
and she's so awesome.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.440
- She's really cool.
- She was telling us about you guys.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.511
Want to play restaurant with me?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.636
Yeah, I would love to.
Where's your restaurant?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.790
- Right over there.
- And what's your doll's name?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.438
Her name is Potato Chips.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.990
- I love potato chips.
- Potato chips are my favorite.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.039
Nice one.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.714
- Can we be the Clippers?
- I'm more of a Lakers fan.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.074
Oh, sorry.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.350
No, you don't have to say sorry.
That's okay.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.720
- We can be the Clippers.
- Okay.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.439
- I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards.
- Yeah. Sure.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.113
Oh, no!

26:50.440 --> 26:51.509
Shoot!

26:51.600 --> 26:53.158
- You did it on purpose!
- What?

26:53.240 --> 26:56.256
- You hit me because I like the Clippers.
- Buddy, I think the Clippers are awesome.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.111
We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.936
It was smart to get rid of Blake Griffin.
That was a great trade for them.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.918
We're obsessed with the Clippers.
I can't get enough of them.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.560
- Theyre amazing.
- Okay.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.279
- Can we play hide and seek?
- You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.033
- I love hide and seek.
- Okay, but just us. No girls.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.668
Sure.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.880
It's not that progressive, but no problem.
Lita, should we go play restaurants?

27:18.040 --> 27:20.759
- Yeah.
- You're it. I'll hide and you count.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.716
You sure you're okay?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.677
- Yeah. Go on, count.
- All right, buddy.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.796
- Count to 20.
- Oh, my God.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.678
You better not embarrass me
at the restaurant.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.389
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

27:32.880 --> 27:34.313
Bad, bad, bad!

27:34.880 --> 27:36.996
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

27:40.320 --> 27:43.312
- I don't think that's...
- Know what? She picks up stuff off the TV.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.594
Yeah.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.716
Don't give me the look.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.153
- Let's not call her bad names like that.
- Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

27:52.240 --> 27:54.629
You think you're better than me, huh?

27:55.760 --> 27:59.469
Pete, if you don't want the kids,
I'm not gonna push you into it.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.553
All right, look...

28:03.280 --> 28:05.635
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

28:05.720 --> 28:08.553
I don't know, I just thought
when we met our kids

28:08.640 --> 28:11.234
that it would be like
this cosmic connection, you know?

28:11.320 --> 28:14.392
Like just take one look at them
and just know, like when you and me met.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.075
Yeah. Totally.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.075
Whoa. What, you didn't just know?

28:21.600 --> 28:22.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

28:23.080 --> 28:24.656
You heard what I said.
You didn't just know?

28:24.680 --> 28:25.680
No, I was interested,

28:25.720 --> 28:27.915
but, you know,
I'm more cautious than you are.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.389
Really? Wow.
How long before you just knew?

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
A couple of months.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.318
A couple of months? How many months?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.195
- Like four...
- Four?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
- -Teen.
- Fourteen?

28:38.320 --> 28:39.150
- Babe, look.
- Oh, my God!

28:39.240 --> 28:41.959
- I knew before we got married, okay?
- That's the point.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.040
We don't have a year-long engagement
on this thing.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.350
If we say "yes,"
they're in our house next week.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.873
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

28:48.920 --> 28:52.230
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.
I felt like I was...

28:52.320 --> 28:54.280
I felt like I was babysitting
other people's kids.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.360
I agree.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.356
- With what?
- With you.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.954
With me wanting the kids
or not wanting the kids?

29:00.040 --> 29:01.792
- Whatever you want.
- That's not an answer.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.440
Then just give me 14 months
to think about it. How 'bout that?

29:04.520 --> 29:05.520
Come on.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.873
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.871
All right, come on, everybody.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.480
Honey, come on.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.959
Jeez.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.554
All right, everybody, hands.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.236
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.231
Eyes closed.

29:32.560 --> 29:36.519
I'm thankful
for my beautiful grandchildren,

29:36.600 --> 29:39.990
including the very lucky kids

29:40.080 --> 29:43.959
that are soon to be adopted
by two wonderful parents.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.553
I'm really thankful for that, too.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.438
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys.
Well done.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.875
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

29:50.960 --> 29:55.476
Yeah, we've decided together
not to move forward with the foster thing.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.155
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't
thought it through properly, so...

29:59.240 --> 30:02.198
Yeah. Jesus Christ. This is great news.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.601
I mean, we were all being supportive
to your faces, but...

30:04.680 --> 30:06.875
Yeah. We all thought
you were out of your minds.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.873
I never said anything,
but I'm thankful to hearthis.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.678
What? Why?

30:12.760 --> 30:16.000
- Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands.
- No, no, no. I would be thankful to know

30:16.080 --> 30:18.071
why you all have a problem with this.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.673
Hey, I never had a problem with it.

30:19.760 --> 30:23.469
I think it's smart. Have a couple kids
without the pregnancy and the hormones

30:23.560 --> 30:26.279
- and the... rage.
- Stop talking.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.909
Ellie, all I'm saying is
that we're thankful

30:30.000 --> 30:32.992
that you and Peter are gonna experience

30:33.080 --> 30:36.993
having the love of your own
beautiful children rather than...

30:37.080 --> 30:39.674
- Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out.
- Hell, I'll say it.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.239
Rather than just rolling the dice

30:41.360 --> 30:43.360
with the offspring
of some criminal or drug addict.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.273
To be honest, we were worried
about our real kids' safety.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.193
- What?
- Were they to hang out with your kids,

30:49.280 --> 30:50.759
- if they're...
- Damaged goods?

30:50.840 --> 30:52.990
You know, when I was growing up
in the neighborhood,

30:53.120 --> 30:54.896
a lot of people thought
I was damaged goods, too.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.592
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.639
We're talking about crack babies
and kids who have been sexually harassed.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.994
Sexually harassed?

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
What do you mean,
their parents made lewd comments?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.673
You know what I mean, wiseass.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.313
Open your stupid eyes.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.881
- How long have everyone's eyes been open?
- Kimmy, you of all people.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.056
What if you can't have a baby/.9

31:14.080 --> 31:16.230
Do not put that out
into the universe, please.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.595
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

31:18.680 --> 31:20.800
If you don't quit being
so nuts about this baby thing,

31:20.840 --> 31:23.434
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get pregnant again this afternoon

31:23.520 --> 31:24.919
just to spite you.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.911
- And you know I can do it.
- Really?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
No.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.776
I'm sorry if we're not
as politically correct as you guys,

31:30.800 --> 31:33.234
but our baby has to be our blood.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.719
Yes! Absolutely!

31:34.800 --> 31:38.190
Oh, my God. "Our blood."
This blood? This blood right here?

31:38.280 --> 31:40.656
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jerry, what do you think of all this?

31:40.680 --> 31:42.176
I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.998
You just spent 30 minutes
talking about the deep state.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.576
You don't have an opinion
on your own family?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.240
- None of my business.
- Thank you, Daddy.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.536
And I would like you all to know
that thousands of children

31:50.560 --> 31:52.755
are spending Thanksgiving
without any family at all.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.353
And right now I kind of envy them.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.914
But I know you guys love me.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.833
I know that I have a place to go
to eat turkey and be thankful.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.717
But a lot of kids don't have that.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.712
And it's not theirfault!
And they're not damaged goods!

32:03.800 --> 32:06.553
So forget what I said before.
It is back on!

32:06.640 --> 32:08.456
- If that's okay with you, honey.
- Yee-haw, baby.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.755
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt
a whole shitwhack of kids.

32:10.840 --> 32:14.150
And I am thankful that whoever
has a problem with it can fuck right off!

32:18.720 --> 32:21.109
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.310
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.232
You're crazy.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.429
Hi, honey. Here we are.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.839
Come in, look around.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.399
This is Meatball.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.395
A Christmas tree?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.914
Does that mean Santa comes here?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.228
Yeah, every year.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.516
- So, you guys are rich.
- What? Rich? No, we're not rich.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.079
I mean, we're doing okay.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.776
- Well.
- When we got this house, it was a dump.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.840
That's what we do. We renovate houses.
Ellie did all the design work in here.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.591
And it's not that expensive at all.

32:56.680 --> 33:00.150
- That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.639
I'm so sorry.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.029
I shouldn't have left this out.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.349
So you guys want to see your rooms?
Come on. Let's go check out your room.

33:10.560 --> 33:14.075
- Lookit! A bed and a bunny!
- What do you think?

33:14.160 --> 33:16.151
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.075
- Whose toys are these?
- Theyre yours, to share.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
Yeah.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.311
Lego!

33:22.960 --> 33:24.359
Can I put my bears in there?

33:24.480 --> 33:25.515
- Sure.
- Of course.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.032
- Wow, you sure have a lot of teddy bears.
- These are just court bears.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.315
They get one every time
we go to family court.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.311
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.200
Look at this, Lita.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.353
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.271
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's just here.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.399
I'm so sorry you have to carry
all your stuff in these awful bags.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.869
- If we knew...
- No, it's cool.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.551
Fun fact: that's actually
how you can spot a foster kid.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.313
The kid carrying her whole life
in a Hefty bag.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.079
It's a foster joke.

33:58.480 --> 33:59.674
Well, make yourself at home.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.240
Yeah, this is your place.
You can do whatever you want with it.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.120
Do you wanna put posters
on the wall, paint it?

34:04.160 --> 34:07.550
Yeah. Come on, this is what we do.
We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.840
Run down to the hardware store,
pick any color you like.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.136
- What do you say/.9
- Any color.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.536
- Just pick a color.
- What do you like?

34:12.560 --> 34:13.840
- Any color you want.
- Anything.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.239
- Pick a color, we're doing it.
- You'd look great in green.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.556
Yeah.

34:22.639 --> 34:23.675
What do you think?

34:25.159 --> 34:29.949
Wow, it's, yeah,
darkest of the black tones.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.918
- Yeah, that's what she picked.
- Dark Kettle Black, huh?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.954
I like it. It's really dope.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.554
- I'm gonna get dinner started.
- Okay.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.235
- She doesn't like it.
- I think she loves it.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.117
You know her better than I do.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.991
- Hey.
- Hey, you all done in there?

34:51.080 --> 34:54.231
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.238
Oh, great. I'm so glad
that she loves her black bedroom.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.995
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita
at Harding in the morning,

35:01.080 --> 35:02.920
and then you can take Lizzy
to the high school.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.316
Did you see their shoes? We might want
to take them to the mall tomorrow.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.628
Kids, dinner!

35:08.560 --> 35:11.028
What? That sounds insane
coming out of your mouth.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.076
- Do we have kids?
- Yeah, three of 'em.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.390
That's insane. I don't believe it.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.040
Did you not know that?
'Cause they're really here.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.432
Holy shit. Holy shit.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.158
Yeah, they're here.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.514
I love you.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.235
- What?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

35:29.320 --> 35:30.355
God.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.630
- What about that one?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

35:37.120 --> 35:38.792
It's gonna be long and weird.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.976
- How 'bout that?
- How 'bout that?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.833
- All right, come on, giggly. Sit down.
- I'm gonna shift the plates.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.240
Great. We have everything.
We have burgers and pasta and...

35:48.320 --> 35:49.639
Can we have potato chips?

35:49.720 --> 35:52.188
Let's get ready for the tub.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.158
You two, come on. Who wants to go first?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.309
Hey!

36:02.040 --> 36:03.473
That's not really a bath toy.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.391
- I don't want this.
- It's not for the bath.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.471
- Oh, no! That's gonna...
- What?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.431
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.600
Baby, next time...

36:17.120 --> 36:18.951
You need...?

36:22.640 --> 36:24.039
Keep it over the sink, please.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.238
Did you flush, sweetie?

36:42.880 --> 36:44.757
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night.

36:44.840 --> 36:45.909
Good night!

36:47.520 --> 36:50.717
- Should we give them a kiss good night?
- I don't know.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.056
- Maybe you should ask, or should we wait?
- Should I ask?

36:53.080 --> 36:55.435
- I'll ask.
- You guys are overthinking this.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.397
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.191
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.589
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

37:07.680 --> 37:10.513
- I'm good. Good night.
- Good night, kiddo.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.872
All right. Good night.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.233
No matter what we do,
Jake just wants to hang out in his room.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.915
Talking on his phone, swearing,
taking the Lord's name in vain.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.149
And cranking his explicit music
till all hours.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.511
And he got into another fight at school.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.216
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt
one of the other kindergartners.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.995
I think maybe it's okay
for a five-year-old to have a cell phone,

37:37.080 --> 37:38.991
but does he have a lot of contacts?

37:39.080 --> 37:41.355
We tried to take it,
but his birth mother gave it to him,

37:41.440 --> 37:42.998
and if we touch it, it's just...

37:43.440 --> 37:46.000
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.033
He doesn't need a phone.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.195
- We're gonna try again.
- Definitely try.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.990
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in
three children ten days ago,

37:56.080 --> 37:59.231
- one of which is a teenager.
- Yeah, it's going pretty good.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.710
I mean, I think our kids made us realize
just what kind of a rut we were in before.

38:02.840 --> 38:06.196
Well, not really a rut, just, like,
the same old routine, you know, like,

38:06.280 --> 38:09.989
work, go to the gym,
grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.316
- You know what I mean.
- No, we don't know.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.598
Well, I think she's just trying to say

38:15.680 --> 38:19.036
that we needed a new challenge,
maybe something to break up the monotony.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.951
That's not the only thing
they're gonna break.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.833
No, I know. I know everyone's
going through tough stufi,

38:26.920 --> 38:29.639
but these kids, I think
they/re just really good. We got lucky.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.760
- They got lucky.
- Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.840
Guys.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.556
Why is this funny?

38:35.640 --> 38:39.394
I think they might be recognizing
a little bit of a honeymoon period.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.711
No, no, no, we thought of that.
But it doesn't feel like a period.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.479
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.154
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.151
Yeah, but we got a plan
to work on that too.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.753
I'm not saying we're perfect parents.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.909
Are you sure?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.320
And I think I might be recognizing
a little bit of jealousy.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.998
That's not a good trait, guys.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.675
Okay, what do we have here?

39:08.040 --> 39:09.234
Christmas!

39:10.040 --> 39:13.191
It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.195
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

39:17.280 --> 39:20.078
- Robot, buddy!
- Lita, look at this big box!

39:20.160 --> 39:21.229
Dude, it walks and talks.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.880
- This could be my helmet!
- What about the presents, guys?

39:23.960 --> 39:26.296
I would've went crazy if I got a robot.
I'm playing with that robot.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.799
And this could be the spaceship.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.598
- Can I go inside?
- Sure.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.234
Hey, guys. Wow, you really
like cardboard boxes, huh?

39:32.320 --> 39:34.629
Is anybody interested
in playing with the giant dollhouse

39:34.720 --> 39:36.438
that took me three hours to assemble?

39:37.240 --> 39:39.196
Did it come in a big box?

39:40.160 --> 39:42.469
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.709
Go, let's go!

39:43.800 --> 39:45.153
Come on. Let's go get the box.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.958
- Christmas is boxes.
- Yes.

39:50.120 --> 39:54.193
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.
Merry Christmas.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.473
- Another one.
- Yeah.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.994
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.915
You didn't have
to get all this stuff for us.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.752
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.235
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

40:08.320 --> 40:09.469
No, no, no!

40:09.680 --> 40:11.955
I'm sorry. I'm happy. lam. l...

40:12.800 --> 40:15.439
It's nice to see
Lita and Juan get presents

40:15.520 --> 40:17.829
that weren't donated from total strangers.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.515
Hey, Lizzy,
if you ever want to talk about anything...

40:21.600 --> 40:24.717
I know it's Christmastime
and you may have memories and things.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.916
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...

40:27.160 --> 40:28.752
I'm good. I...

40:29.480 --> 40:32.199
You know what?
I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.793
So, I'm gonna get that.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.791
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.880
Okay.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.313
And we want to thank the Lord
for our first Christmas together.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.073
And we want to give thanks
for this lovely meal

40:55.160 --> 40:57.310
and also this...

40:57.800 --> 41:00.792
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.313
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.197
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.838
Where's my potato chips?

41:05.920 --> 41:08.388
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin.
Sorry.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.277
- I want my chips.
- Lita!

41:10.360 --> 41:12.669
Lizzy. Pete and I worked really hard
on this dinner,

41:12.760 --> 41:14.376
and there's lots of yummy food
for you to eat.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.913
.L-| -No!
Ey, hey, hey

41:18.840 --> 41:21.593
Lizzy, Lizzy, please!
Liny, no, okay? I've got this.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.955
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm just trying to help you.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.554
I'm not yelling at...
I'm sorry. I am. Just then I was.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.675
But it's... Look.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.478
Lita, don't do what Lizzy just said.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.400
What did you say? Cuatro?
"Go to your bedroom"?

41:31.440 --> 41:33.908
No, cuatro means "quart."
Like quart of milk.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.080
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato
chip, but you will drink that milk."

41:37.160 --> 41:39.594
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.398
Okay. Fine.

41:41.480 --> 41:44.313
Okay. Let's try some
of this meat loaf, okay?

41:44.400 --> 41:47.278
- No! I want my chips!
- You're not having chips!

41:47.400 --> 41:49.994
I don't think she's getting on board
with the plan, honey.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.718
- I don't want this!
- Hey!

41:51.800 --> 41:53.376
Sure you don't want
to just give her chips?

41:53.400 --> 41:55.436
No, we're not giving her chips.
She's gonna eat...

41:59.960 --> 42:01.109
Lita, stay right there!

42:02.360 --> 42:04.191
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

42:04.280 --> 42:06.510
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.238
- Watch your feet, okay/2
- Raised feet!

42:08.320 --> 42:09.958
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.189
You give those to me.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.994
- Calm down, don't cry.
- I want my chips!

42:14.080 --> 42:15.080
Just stay there, Juan.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.914
These are really, really good potatoes.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.591
- God!
- Oh, my God. Are you okay/.7

42:24.680 --> 42:25.749
Oh, God.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.433
Lita, duck!

42:29.120 --> 42:31.350
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying to put it out!

42:31.440 --> 42:33.078
- With ketchup?
- Put it out!

42:35.680 --> 42:37.033
- All right.
- Lita?

42:38.760 --> 42:40.557
Wait, what's that noise?

42:42.320 --> 42:43.196
Why is she growling?

42:43.280 --> 42:45.280
That wasn't in the classes.
I got nothing for that.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.755
She's got a knife.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.736
- It's just a SpongeBob knife.
- It's still a knife.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.000
Just put the knife down, honey.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.696
Look, kid, just put
down the weapon, okay/.9

42:52.720 --> 42:55.040
You guys want me to deal with this,
or do you still got it?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.896
Yeah, do you wanna let her
jump in here now, please?

42:56.920 --> 42:58.512
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!

43:09.800 --> 43:11.438
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.556
Why would you give a kid milk
in a glass cup?

43:13.640 --> 43:15.278
I'm sorry. I didn't...

43:15.360 --> 43:17.715
Why did she do that? I hate her!

43:19.600 --> 43:21.716
That didn't take long.
They hate us already.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.159
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

43:29.680 --> 43:30.749
Okay, okay, okay!

43:30.840 --> 43:32.558
- I want a Barbie!
- No.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.519
This isn't even a real Barbie.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.096
You've got a real Barbie at home
that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.793
Santa got me a fat Barbie!
1 want a skinny Barbie!

43:39.880 --> 43:41.472
She's not fat. She's body positive.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.438
Lita, if you put the doll back,
I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.351
So you're rewarding this behavior?

43:46.440 --> 43:48.590
- What are you thinking?
- You handle it.

43:48.680 --> 43:52.229
- Juan, come on, get out of there, please?
- Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

43:52.840 --> 43:55.912
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have
hit him. I would never hit a kid.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.353
I want a Barbie!

43:57.440 --> 43:59.560
Stop right now,
or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.512
We're not starving people here, okay?
I have this under control.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.114
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

44:05.200 --> 44:07.953
Okay, you're done.
Gimme that. Give it to me.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.656
- Just give me that now!
- Hey, hey, hey!

44:09.680 --> 44:12.194
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.793
- Scan it! Hurry!
- No.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.309
No! We're not doing this!

44:17.800 --> 44:20.314
- Someone videotaping this?
- Pete, where are you?

44:20.400 --> 44:22.118
- Where's Pete?
- You're done.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.192
Oh, great. You're out there?
Thank you so much.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.800
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car,
saved you a little walking time.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.910
- We had a front space.
- Well, it's still closer.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.231
- Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll.
- Wow.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.515
- You caved, huh?
- No, I did not cave.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.636
I bought it for her.
It was only four bucks.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.676
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

44:54.240 --> 44:56.959
Holy shit. There they are.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.869
Hey, Jan, Jerry? They're here.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.270
Oh, man. Kid dinged a Porsche.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.476
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

45:07.600 --> 45:08.999
All right, just don't cry, okay/2

45:09.080 --> 45:10.433
He's gonna have to leave a note.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.154
It's okay.
Just help get the stuff out of the back.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.073
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.275
We've got the pizza!

45:17.400 --> 45:19.216
Juan, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, bud?

45:19.240 --> 45:20.559
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.016
- It's so warm.
- Hey, put that down.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.349
Put the pizza down.
You can't hold it like that.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.234
Hey, Dad.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.157
You must be Lizzy.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.719
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.556
This is Lita and Juan.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.638
Hello, Lita.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.436
Hello, Juan.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.470
I'm Grammy "Hw-an"
and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

45:42.560 --> 45:44.755
Mom, can you just talk
like a normal person?

45:44.840 --> 45:46.910
I like the way she says her J's.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.831
- Can you please?
- It's sophisticated.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.433
- Here you go, brother.
- Thanks, man.

45:53.200 --> 45:56.476
I can't get over it.
They look just like normal kids.

45:56.560 --> 45:59.233
What did you think they were gonna
look like, Russ? Little pirates?

45:59.360 --> 46:01.828
I don't know. They're just so cute.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.638
How is the new school?

46:03.720 --> 46:06.678
It's good. It's like... It's school.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.079
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.154
And what's the boy situation?
Anything exciting?

46:11.240 --> 46:13.071
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.096
She doesn't like to talk
about that kind of stuff.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.236
So just go easy.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.873
What? You don't.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.909
- Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob.
- Yeah?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.912
Wow, that's a cute name.
Jacob. I like it. Like Jake.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.912
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob." Right?

46:30.960 --> 46:32.916
No, no, it's just Jacob.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Jacob.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.238
Yeah, and he's not cute.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.157
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.120
You know, I was never
into the cute ones either.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.752
Nah. Cute's overrated.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.991
Right, I didn't either.
I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.080
Shut up!

46:50.840 --> 46:54.071
You look like a monkey

46:54.320 --> 46:57.869
And you smell like one too

47:04.400 --> 47:07.000
Lizzy, can we put the phone away
while we're at the table, please,

47:07.080 --> 47:08.195
like we talked about?

47:08.880 --> 47:10.677
- Lizzy, please.
- Give her the phone.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.456
Guys, check it out.
There's some shit going down.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.869
Lizzy, the phone. Now.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.752
Is that her real mom?
Yeah, that's a harsh move.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.513
Actually, if you read
your foster parent regs,

47:23.600 --> 47:27.354
you know you're not allowed to take away
any of my personal property, so...

47:28.760 --> 47:31.718
It's the look. She's doing the look.
Ketchup. I gotta get some ketchup.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.475
Pete, you'd said you'd say something
to her next time she acts all bitchy.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.136
I never said the word "bitchy."
It was her word, not mine.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.390
I am always the bad guy
because you're never there.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.736
I'm not gonna apologize for working.
Somebody's gotta deal

47:42.760 --> 47:45.096
with that dump of a house you bought
before it bankrupts us.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.401
I bought? You loved it too.
And that's not even the point.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.816
The point is, when you are there,
you let them get away with murder.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.256
I got on Lizzyjust last night
when she wouldn't clean up after dinner!

47:52.280 --> 47:53.679
Perfect parent, huh?

47:54.480 --> 47:55.310
Is this funny, Kit?

47:55.400 --> 47:57.400
I think we're all enjoying
this a little bit, Pete.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.755
Okay.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.997
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:04.080 --> 48:06.355
I never get tired of watching
white people fight.

48:07.080 --> 48:07.956
Nor do l.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.871
But why don't you calm down,

48:09.960 --> 48:13.953
and tell us, without blaming each other,
what the main issues are.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.678
Well, Lita is just constantly-

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
I don't want to!

48:18.320 --> 48:20.311
And Juan, 1 mean,
he just doesn't use his head.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.400
- Unlock the window!
- And if I say anything about any of it...

48:26.480 --> 48:28.550
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.108
- Lizzy's favorite pastime is just...
- Just leave me alone!

48:31.200 --> 48:32.216
Thanks for making me late.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.514
You're an asshole.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.216
And God forbid we actually try
to parent the little ones.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.117
No, no, no, that's her territory.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.599
Don't forget when Lizzy was ten

48:39.680 --> 48:41.910
her mother would disappear
for weeks at a time,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.151
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan
and Lita all by herself.

48:45.240 --> 48:48.391
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside
and let you two take over.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.536
Are you saying that we should
let her parent the kids?

48:50.560 --> 48:51.788
Are you paying attention?

48:51.880 --> 48:54.030
She's 15. She's a terrible parent.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.434
She needs to be a kid.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.114
You gotta step up and become the parents.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.998
- But you just said she won't let us.
- Nope, she won't.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.256
You know, Karen, you've been
a godsend through most of this,

49:03.280 --> 49:04.918
but you're just about to piss me off!

49:05.000 --> 49:08.879
Pete, you won't get anywhere with her
until you two get on the same page.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.393
- Right?
- That's right.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.710
And, you know,
if she's hostile with you again,

49:12.800 --> 49:14.597
maybe try using the three R's.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.473
Okay? Number one: regulate.

49:17.920 --> 49:21.390
"Lima why don't you take
some deep breaths, count to ten."

49:21.520 --> 49:23.590
Number two: relate.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.318
"I understand that you're upset.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.078
Nobody likes to feel this way."

49:27.160 --> 49:30.118
- That's good.
- Number three: reason.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.998
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

49:33.080 --> 49:36.436
What's not okay
is to threaten to slash our throats

49:36.520 --> 49:38.476
in the middle of the night
when we're asleep."

49:39.840 --> 49:41.319
I'm sorry, did 1...?

49:41.400 --> 49:43.072
That was actually us. Our story.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.275
- Yeah.
- Last session.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.360
The little guy didn't
follow through with it though.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.556
- Well, not yet!
- Not yet.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.473
Sorry. We shouldn't be laughing.

49:53.560 --> 49:57.678
No, it's actually important to have
a sense of humor about this kind of thing.

49:57.760 --> 50:00.957
That's right. You gotta laugh
or you'll never make it through this.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.314
That is right.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.312
Speaking of which,
next up we have October,

50:05.680 --> 50:07.875
who still hasn't been matched
with a child.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.632
Well, there's some good news.

50:12.480 --> 50:15.836
So, together we're all gonna decide
which chore we'd like to do

50:15.920 --> 50:17.831
and then each week we'll mix it up.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.115
- Can I do "Feed Meatball"?
- Yes!

50:20.200 --> 50:23.476
- I want to feed Meatball!
- You can feed him next week.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.630
Pete, I hope she's not serious
about all this.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.678
It's not just she, it's we.
And we are. Very serious.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.440
Okay, so you want us
to wash your feet too?

50:30.520 --> 50:32.158
- Lizzy.
- This is bullshit!

50:32.240 --> 50:33.958
Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

50:34.040 --> 50:35.792
Lizzy. Let's just...

50:36.200 --> 50:38.475
Let's try something else.
Can we just take a moment,

50:39.200 --> 50:41.236
and calm down, and take a few breaths?

50:41.600 --> 50:42.635
Please?

50:43.880 --> 50:44.949
Try it.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.154
Nice! Nice.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.136
And we hear you
that you're frustrated with the chart.

50:53.160 --> 50:54.878
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.475
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated!
We're all frustrated.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.597
So let's think about next time
how we can express ourselves better.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.636
Okay. Okay. Well...

51:04.640 --> 51:08.110
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

51:08.960 --> 51:11.269
tryand use the three R's on me,

51:11.360 --> 51:13.720
I could barf all over the ground
because it's so nauseating!

51:13.840 --> 51:15.512
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.319
Oh, good! You're home!

51:18.400 --> 51:19.594
Hi!

51:19.720 --> 51:22.029
Mom, I told you to text or call.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.236
You told me to give you
a few weeks to settle in.

51:24.320 --> 51:27.392
Well, it's been a few weeks,
and I want to meet my new grandkids.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.272
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

51:29.360 --> 51:31.635
- No, she doesn't like it when you...
- Come here!

51:32.600 --> 51:34.158
I'm your Grandma Sandy.

51:34.240 --> 51:37.471
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you,
they have to deal with me.

51:37.560 --> 51:40.074
We're family now,
and I got your back forever. You hear me?

51:40.200 --> 51:41.440
Mom, just take it easy. Please.

51:41.520 --> 51:44.478
Oh, my God! Will you look at them!

51:44.560 --> 51:47.154
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy.
This is Pete's mom.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.512
I could just eat you two up!

51:50.600 --> 51:52.318
And how's my baby boy?

51:56.360 --> 51:57.839
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.216
Mom, you gotta give us a few minutes.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.016
We were just in the middle
of a family meeting.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.076
Perfect, because I'm a member
of the family.

52:03.560 --> 52:06.074
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.958
I got the whole family
tickets to Six Flags!

52:11.000 --> 52:12.797
What's Six Flags?

52:12.880 --> 52:13.995
"What's Six Flags?"

52:14.080 --> 52:15.911
Mom, you know what?
That's such a nice offer,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.594
but things have been
a little chaotic around here,

52:18.680 --> 52:19.960
and we need things to be normal.

52:20.280 --> 52:24.512
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your
kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.959
Your kids.

52:28.640 --> 52:31.632
Ma, it's just not a good time,
so we're not doing this, okay?

52:31.720 --> 52:34.616
We're not doing this, right? We're on the
same page because of the structure thing?

52:34.640 --> 52:35.914
Yeah, yeah.

52:36.680 --> 52:38.716
Honey? Right, El?

52:43.600 --> 52:46.114
- I did not cave.
- You caved.

52:46.200 --> 52:47.838
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

52:47.920 --> 52:51.071
Okay, so maybe I just wanted
to be the fun parent for once

52:51.160 --> 52:52.559
instead of being the bad guy.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.416
I tried being the bad guy.
You wouldn't let me.

52:54.440 --> 52:58.035
Okay, fine. I'm sorry, I really am.
But look how much fun everybody's having.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.157
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling.
It's crazy.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.914
Hey! Did you have fun?

53:03.000 --> 53:04.718
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.791
I love the big rides.
You want to go on the...

53:07.480 --> 53:08.708
Hey, Lizzy!

53:08.920 --> 53:10.751
- He
y, what's u?
- Hi! P-

53:10.840 --> 53:12.831
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you too!

53:14.360 --> 53:16.351
Hey, hey. What's up?

53:17.560 --> 53:19.835
Kylie, Savanna, these are my...

53:20.680 --> 53:21.680
fosters.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.955
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're the fosters!

53:24.040 --> 53:25.496
Right, so I'll see you guys later, okay?

53:25.520 --> 53:27.511
Actually we were just gonna go
on the water ride.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.198
Let her go with her friends.

53:29.280 --> 53:32.636
They don't want to be stuck here
with a bunch of old farts like you two.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.837
They want to ride the big stuff
and check out the hot boys.

53:37.280 --> 53:40.352
Here's a hundred. Buy yourselves
some souvenirs and junk food.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.395
Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

53:43.480 --> 53:45.198
All right, cool.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.750
Okay, I'll meet you guys
at the front at...

53:47.840 --> 53:49.336
What time are we going back to your house?

53:49.360 --> 53:54.070
We're going back to our house,
where we all live, at 7:00!

53:54.160 --> 53:56.116
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

53:56.200 --> 53:58.794
- Mom, what are you doing? You can't...
- Oh, no!

53:58.920 --> 54:01.514
Little Juanny's upchucking
in the trash bin!

54:01.600 --> 54:03.272
You all right, peanut?

54:04.040 --> 54:06.429
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

54:18.440 --> 54:21.796
I know she's getting these texts.
I can see the dots.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.360
Maybe she ran off,
or maybe something happened to her.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.910
No, she didn't. She's just treating us
like another set of fosters.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.633
All right, bye.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.112
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

54:34.400 --> 54:35.594
I'm the bad guy. Watch this.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
Bye.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.110
Bye!

54:38.200 --> 54:40.634
Hey! Where the hell were you?

54:41.080 --> 54:44.470
We went to the movies, and it ran
a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

54:44.560 --> 54:47.199
Really? You couldn't have taken
five seoonds to text or call us

54:47.280 --> 54:49.510
and let us know nobody murdered you?
Well, guess what?

54:49.640 --> 54:51.835
- You're grounded.
- I'm grounded?

54:51.920 --> 54:53.880
Yeah. You're grounded
because I just grounded you.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.656
Before you weren't grounded,
you weren't anything,

54:55.680 --> 54:58.296
and then I just said that thing
that I said, and now you're grounded!

54:58.320 --> 55:01.357
- We've been waiting one hourfor you!
- I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

55:01.440 --> 55:02.976
- He's the bad guy.
- You're not going anywhere.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.194
- You're done!
- Done!

55:04.320 --> 55:05.958
- Don't want to hear it!
- You know what?

55:06.040 --> 55:08.031
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

55:08.120 --> 55:11.317
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex
is a comparatively safe environment.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.594
Oh, no. No.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.955
You don't play
that troubled past card with us.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.718
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

55:17.200 --> 55:19.077
- Grandma Sandy, I forgot.
- What?

55:19.160 --> 55:20.160
I got you...

55:22.160 --> 55:23.639
Oh, sweet Jesus.

55:23.720 --> 55:26.996
Will you look at this?
I'm gonna wear it every day.

55:27.880 --> 55:28.915
Come here!

55:29.960 --> 55:32.190
You know, this reminds me of when Pete

55:32.280 --> 55:34.953
and his little degenerate friends
stole a pizza truck.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.508
- She's good. She's good.
- Oh, God.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.318
You two gonna stand there all night,

55:42.800 --> 55:45.096
You remember I told you
we weren't special enough for this?

55:45.120 --> 55:47.395
- We were doing fine.
- You said that we were in a rut.

55:47.480 --> 55:49.256
Maybe we were spoiled
and didn't appreciate the rut.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.360
The rut was easy and quiet.
You know, I miss the rut.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.674
But you had to be a mommy.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.149
Whose idea was it
to go and talk to the teenagers?

55:55.240 --> 55:57.816
We could've had a toddler who doesn't
have opinions and thong underwear.

55:57.840 --> 56:00.229
- What?
- You pushed us into some next-level shit!

56:00.320 --> 56:02.356
Look, we can't start
turning on each other here.

56:02.440 --> 56:05.079
If we just stay calm and we work together,

56:05.160 --> 56:08.072
we can find a way to get
these little assholes out of our house!

56:09.160 --> 56:10.176
- Now we're talking!
Right?

56:10.200 --> 56:12.509
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Hello!

56:12.600 --> 56:15.433
- I hate them so much.
- Me too. They're the worst.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.829
Theyre so ungrateful.
We're doing everything for them.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.717
- And they could give two shits.
- Right?

56:19.800 --> 56:21.028
Guess what?

56:21.120 --> 56:22.439
They're not adopted yet.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.988
No. No, they're not.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.354
We could just...

56:27.800 --> 56:28.800
put 'em back.

56:29.160 --> 56:32.311
I mean, yes, we would look like
the worst people in the world, but...

56:32.400 --> 56:34.789
Yeah, we would. And right now
everybody thinks we're saints.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.279
I know. I love that part.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.271
I do love that part.
That's the only good part.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.039
Just an idea.

56:41.480 --> 56:44.040
What if we say
that some relatives came forward?

56:44.440 --> 56:46.510
The courts took 'em.
There's nothing we could do.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.838
Right? We squirt a few tears,
we act super devastated.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.831
That's good. That's good.
That's very good.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.434
And we get our clean house
and date night back.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.832
And everybody feels sorry for us.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.593
Get some presents maybe.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.753
We're never gonna do that.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.560
No.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.438
It's a nice thought, but we're...

57:14.880 --> 57:17.917
- We're stuck, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.037
You know, we gotta just accept
that we made a terrible mistake

57:21.120 --> 57:23.156
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

57:23.680 --> 57:24.680
Good night, honey.

57:44.200 --> 57:47.158
All right,
one nail on each side of the slat.

57:47.240 --> 57:49.515
- Okay.
- On both ends, okay?

57:49.600 --> 57:52.160
3100in
- Yes, excellent.

57:53.480 --> 57:56.199
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.317
What are you doing? You want to get in?
You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

58:02.600 --> 58:04.272
Speak of the devil.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
What are they doing here?

58:06.160 --> 58:07.736
You never said
I couldn't have people over.

58:07.760 --> 58:11.150
Everybody knows you can't have people over
when you're grounded.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.070
And you know that too,

58:12.160 --> 58:14.594
because they obviously came in
through the window.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.790
This place is disgusting, by the way.

58:16.880 --> 58:19.952
- God, what a Nazi bitch.
- What did you call me?

58:20.040 --> 58:21.871
I don't know,
you just seem like a Nazi bitch.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.791
Get out. Now.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.757
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now!

58:25.840 --> 58:26.989
No, you get out of my room.

58:27.080 --> 58:30.516
No, no, I'm staying in your black room.
These guys are leaving.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.716
No, out the window, Pussy Riot!
Way you came in!

58:32.800 --> 58:34.074
- Out, now!
- Holy shit!

58:34.160 --> 58:35.593
Out! Out!

58:36.040 --> 58:38.998
- You're literally crazy!
- You're driving me crazy!

58:39.080 --> 58:41.310
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

58:41.400 --> 58:44.198
- You're acting like you're a psychopath.
- Start the car.

58:44.280 --> 58:47.670
- What is going on in there?
- Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.320
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling my caseworker.

58:50.400 --> 58:51.674
That's a good idea, huh?

58:51.760 --> 58:54.816
Get CPS to come, make your little brother
and sister pack up their court bears

58:54.840 --> 58:57.336
and trash bags in the middle of the night
and move them back to the Muskies?

58:57.360 --> 58:59.216
- That'll be really good for them.
- Better than you.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.753
No! Not better than me!

59:00.840 --> 59:02.990
I can't with you.
Can you please deal with her, Pete?

59:03.080 --> 59:05.594
- Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna...
- We're really good people!

59:05.680 --> 59:08.831
We just want to make a nice home for you.
Is that so wrong?

59:08.920 --> 59:11.656
You're just another white lady
who wants to adopt little charity orphans

59:11.680 --> 59:12.936
to make you feel good about yourself.

59:12.960 --> 59:15.428
Pete, you tell her
what my nationality is! Tell her!

59:15.520 --> 59:16.696
Well, actually by blood she is...

59:16.720 --> 59:19.917
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay?
So I'm not that white!

59:20.000 --> 59:22.016
And do I look like lfeel good
about myself right now?

59:22.040 --> 59:23.837
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

59:23.920 --> 59:26.878
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to get foster kids?

59:27.520 --> 59:30.159
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

59:30.240 --> 59:32.435
- "Pete, please?" Exactly.
- No, I...

59:32.520 --> 59:33.760
Hey, you're not going anywhere.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.229
Stop right there! I mean it.
Don't open that door.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.515
Hey! Do not get in that car, you hear me?

59:40.000 --> 59:41.558
Don't shut that door, I mean it!

59:42.520 --> 59:44.696
Good. Now can we just go inside
so we can talk about this?

59:44.720 --> 59:46.153
Juan, drop it right now!

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.040
What are you doing? Take it out!

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.776
No, better to leave it in
till we get to the hospital.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.631
You're okay. You're okay, buddy.
We're here.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.755
We're here. You're okay.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.873
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.190
Relax.
We'll get you there in one second, okay?

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.156
- Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay.
- Come on.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.080
You know what?
Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.196
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.936
- I got you, buddy. I got you.
- Get in, get in, get in.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960
I got you.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.396
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.096
You're a brave boy, you hear me?
Look at me.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.269
You're so brave. Yeah?

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.480
You're doing such a good job, buddy.
We're right here.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.315
Hello! Hey, help, please.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.391
- What happened?
- He's got a nail in his foot.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.160
I didn't want to take it out,
just in case.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.176
That was very smart.
Put him fight on this gurney.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.269
Hey, buddy.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.157
It's all right, buddy. We're here.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.116
Are you the mother?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.031
- Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.
- Okay.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.554
Right this way, Dad.
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.680
Juan, we're gonna clean this off,
give you a little anesthetic,

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.233
and then take this nail out.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.640
Hold my hand. It's just gonna be
a little pinch, okay? Look at me.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.308
- Hold my hand, hold my hand.
- A little bit of a sting.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.074
Stop! Stop!

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.639
- It's almost over.
- That's it.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.676
It's done! It's done. It's done.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.236
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.200
You want to go with her
or stay here with Juan?

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.273
You take her.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.640
- Come here.
- Hey, I'm right here.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.994
He's okay.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.593
You're so brave.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.592
You're doing so good, buddy.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.715
So he doesn't have to wear
a cast or anything?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.994
- It's just stitches?
- Yeah.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.672
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.674
And how did this happen?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.159
It was my fault. I walked away,

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.470
and I left the gun there.
Juan just picked it up.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.233
No. It wasn't theirfault. It was mine.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.520
I was trying to leave in a car
and I wasn't supposed to,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.074
and then they got distracted,
and then I yelled at Juan,

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.536
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.256
Sweetie, don't be ridiculous. I should
never have left the nail gun there.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.238
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff
they move kids for, okay/2

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.056
It wasn't their fault.
They didn't do anything.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.000
I should be the one
getting in trouble right now.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.196
It's okay.
Why don't you come on over here?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.349
Excuse me.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.238
And... let's talk about what happened.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.472
So, nobody's being moved.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.758
Hey. What's wrong?

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.194
I have no idea.
I just woke up this morning and...

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
Damn it.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.477
You know what? I think I can help.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.474
I have a...

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.629
I have this really great detangler.
You want me to...?

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.636
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.233
Okay, here.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.631
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
Okay.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.518
- Wow, how'd this happen?
- I don't know.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.430
Yeah.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.192
Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.396
Okay. That's good.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.873
- Better, yeah?
- Wow. Yeah. Thank you.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.196
Let me just smooth it out for you.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.309
Thank you.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.070
No problem. It's all gone.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.198
- You all set?
- Yep.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.350
- Hey, thanks for the lunch.
- No problem.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.357
Is that that boy Jacob?

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.240
The one that just picked up
that bit of trash?

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.952
- Don't freak out about it.
- No! Why would I freak out about it?

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.595
He looks like an artistic type,
like you said.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.272
- You think so?
- Definitelyl

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.079
- Look at that face.
- Yeah.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.549
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.949
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.353
Well, have a good day.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.518
- Thanks. You too.
- Okay.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.639
All right. Careful with yourfoot, Juan.
Bye, Lita.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.593
Well, did you see that?

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.000
Definitely starting to hate me
a bit less, fight?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040
Maybe.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.271
- Hi, Lizzy.
- Hey, Charlie.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.474
Hi, Jacob.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.919
Wassup, baby girl?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.070
Nothing. How you doing?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.518
I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.680
Well, why don't you get into school
before you get me in trouble.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.194
All right, fine.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.913
- Text me.
- Okay.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.319
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.595
- Hi. How's she doing?
- She's good.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.312
And check this out.
I got here early, and Lizzy saw me,

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.233
and she came over,
and just starts talking.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.629
- To you?
- Yeah!

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.996
Not, like, full-on girl talk,
but not the usual silent treatment either.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.576
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.273
and how he doesn't say much
so she can't tell if he likes her.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.670
Next thing I know I'm in full morn mode,
giving her advice, like,

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.718
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types
you'll have to make the first move."

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.553
Wait. You said "make a move"?
You told her to make a move on a boy/.7

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.234
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.153
I'm thrilled she even likes him.
I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.674
- What happened?
- Juan broke Potato Chips.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.228
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay/2
Here you go. See?

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.197
Thanks, Daddy.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.240
Did you hear that?
I just got my first "Daddy'!

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.320
That's...

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.400
You suck!

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.835
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.679
- Lita, can I help you with anything?
- Nope!

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.352
No, what? Are you talking to me?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.793
- Who am I?
- Ellie.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.110
Juan. Buddy, come here!

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Come here, Son.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.080
How's your foot? You okay?
You okay if I call you "Son"?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.354
Sure.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.696
- Where's Lizzy?
- Right there. See her?

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.869
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.016
She just comes out here,
she takes all this stuff out,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.600
and she can't bother
with the one second it takes

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.114
to close a stupid door
or put anything in the sink.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.240
What happened?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.999
I found my hairbrush
in the toilet this morning.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.758
- What?
- I told you that wasn't me!

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.308
Of course it was you.
I left it in the bathroom for you!

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.118
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.395
I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.959
I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.480
I thought we were really connecting.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.353
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't do it.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.668
- Wow. Hello.
- What is that?

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.830
You're wearing that?
Are you going to a strip club?

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.275
Sorry I don't dress
like an uptight douche like you.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.016
No, no.
You don't talk to my wife like that!

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.240
This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.629
You know what?
Go put some clothes on, a lot of them,

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.576
then get in my truck.
I'm driving you this morning.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.114
Oh, my God! You guys are so annoying!

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.033
- Change the clothes.
- It's not that big of a deal.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.758
- Hey.
- Do I dress like a douche?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.716
No. Make sure she gets down to my truck.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.870
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.037
Oh, my goodness.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.870
Hey, what's that? Oh!

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.627
Ow!

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.953
You okay?

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
That's a shame.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.551
What are we doing here?

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.834
Let's go.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.395
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.469
Come on.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.279
Okay. So you're punishing me
with manual labor.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.591
- I've worked harder than you've ever...
- Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.960
This isn't a punishment, okay/.9

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.191
Hey! I'm Stewart. You probably...

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.917
You... What's up?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.514
Stewart.
Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.273
- As a matter of fact, go to lunch.
- It's 8:15.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.871
Okay. Lunch it is.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.953
Come on.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.591
- Put these on.
- What?

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.158
Just put them on.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.356
Lizzy, 1 know you're angry.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.032
At us, at the world.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.599
Maybe at yourself a little bit.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.193
I don't know, and you're not talking.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.352
Truth is, when I'm pissed
I don't like to talk about it, either.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:48.997
But you know what I do like to do?

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.399
I like to break shit.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:53.879
Really?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.399
Anything in this room.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.359
- Swing away.
- Okay.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.797
- How'd that feel?
- It felt good!

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.871
- Feels good? I told you.
- Yeah.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.117
Don't waste it, all right?
I want you to do me a favor.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.672
I need you to think about something
that really pisses you off.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760
- You got it?
- I got it.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.909
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.592
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.875
Yes!

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.110
- There you go. You like that?
- Yeah, that was good.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240
All right, come on.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.551
There we go. Yes!

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.036
Double shot!

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560
You like that?

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.353
That was cool.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.157
So no school today, huh?

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.920
Pete took me to the house you're fiipping.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.238
We did some demo work.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.435
That's cool.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.431
Hey, hey, come on.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.110
About that hairbrush...

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.511
My mom used to brush my hair,

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.357
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.749
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.435
- No, you have no reason to be sorry.
- No, I'm really sorry.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.029
All right.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.957
I'm gonna go clean up.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.758
Hairbrush is in the toilet,
if you need it.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080
Good one.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.152
Thank you.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.557
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.673
Juan hit me!

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.838
Oh, no. Oh, God!

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.833
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.988
- I'm okay.
- 0kay.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.308
I didn't hit her!

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.995
- Juan, where did you put my phone?
- I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.233
All right! First try!

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.755
There you go.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.592
Dad, Dad, Dad!

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.079
There you go, Juan.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640
Oh, gosh.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.870
Spit it out, spit it out!

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.598
- Here, water!
- No, we need ice!

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.272
Water, water. Here.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.229
Hey.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.359
Hey, buddy.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.036
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.910
Hey. It's okay, sweetie.
Did you have a bad dream?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.228
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.198
You're okay. You're safe and sound
in your bed. You're good.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.353
Good night, buddy.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.311
Good night, Mommy.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.080
What?

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.153
What did you say/.9

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.832
Juan, what did you say?

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.230
Did you say something, Juan?

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.593
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.720
Juan!

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120
Juan!

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.959
Did you say something? Juan!

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600
Juan, what did you say?

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.235
Juan!

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.159
Oh, my God.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.393
Good night, buddy.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.952
Amiss
,3 -_~_.-:.-
amâ:

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.028
- Wow, it's looking good.
- You like it?

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.157
I put the storage at the end
of the island, like you suggested.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.356
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.635
- Great idea, by the way.
- It's awesome.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.633
No, l...

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.198
So, there's...

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.028
There's something I'd like to do and I was
hoping I'd get your help setting it up.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.475
- Sure. What are we setting up?
- Of course. Anything.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.632
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon,

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.837
and they...

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.749
My mom got out a few months ago, so...

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.719
And I haven't seen her.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.711
I was hoping I could see her.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.391
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, of course.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.198
I mean, that's...

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.032
Cool. Thanks.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.838
- Yeah.
- It's cool. Great.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.152
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.120
You...

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.672
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120
Mom!

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.673
Hi.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.113
Hi, Mom.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.676
Juan, Lita.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.830
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.359
Come on.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.319
What's wrong? Come on.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.039
I want to stay with Mom.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.758
Your mommy's over there.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.717
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- It's okay, honey.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.552
- We'll go with you.
- We're right here.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.433
Slow down.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.351
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.998
Come, mi amor.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.550
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.154
- You must be Pete and Ellie?
- Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.711
Hey. I'm Ellie.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.439
- This is Carla. She's...
- Their mom.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.956
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.079
I'm Pete.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.869
Hey, I wanted to say thank you
for watching them while I was...

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.188
No problem.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.955
They've been doing great.
Juan started playing piano, right, buddy?

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.996
And Lita just got 100
on her last spelling test,

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.752
and Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.990
All right, so you guys
gonna pick us up at 4:00?

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Okay.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.830
- We'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah, we'll be back.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.434
- We'll be back soon.
- Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.509
You okay?

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.549
"Thanks for watching them"?

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.313
Like we've just been fricking
babysitting for five months?

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.916
She's just not what I pictured at all.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.228
She's...

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.151
She kind of looks normal.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.672
I feel bad, like we're
breaking up a family.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.990
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.877
The courts did. And don't forget why.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.394
Those kids were living like feral cats
in a crack house.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.313
I know, I know, but she kind of...

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800
She looks okay.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.269
I mean, Sharon said she's been
clean for four months.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.158
Yeah, she got clean
because she was in jail, Ellie.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.317
Look at the way Lizzys looking at her.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.671
She's still her mom.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.873
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.432
So lsaid, "Young lady,

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.830
we hear about you throwing food
in the cafeteria one more time,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.760
and you're gonna have
a couple of lunch dates."

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.995
Next day, the behavior continued.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.712
So we went to the school
and joined her in the cafeteria.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.437
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.830
I walked them through some of my better
bird-watching stories.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.717
They were completely uninterested.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.394
But that food throwing has stopped!

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.593
Would you like to share your news?

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.238
About the couch fire?

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.310
No. About your .26 hearing.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400
Yes.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.033
The court has legally cleared us...

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.199
to adopt.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.479
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.600
Yay!

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.874
That is so great.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.791
Congratulations, guys.
I'm so happy for you.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.552
That is such great news.
I'm so happy for both of you.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.709
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.709
Well,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.313
you know, our kids have, what, had now,
four visits with their birth mom?

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.957
And every time they do,
they're just crazy for a few days after.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.636
Holy...

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.076
And just when things finally
start to feel normal again,

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.229
they have another visit.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.710
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.736
And I know this probably makes me
a really bad person,

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.514
but I just keep wishing
that their mom would go back to prison.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.192
You're not a bad person.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.874
When someone does terrible things
to the children we love,

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.030
it's not easy to find empathy for them,

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.554
but we have to try, people.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.834
Whatever happens,

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.388
the time that your kids spent with you

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.755
made a big difference in their lives.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.638
Yeah, I know,
but then we're just supposed to...

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.068
Wait.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.549
- Did you say "made" a difference?
- Yeah, she did.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.278
We'll talk after.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.794
No. She said "made".
That's past tense. There's a difference.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.677
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.399
Well...

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.555
Since Lizzys mom has been keeping up
with her reunification steps...

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.673
the judge changed your .26 hearing
to a Change of Circumstances hearing

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.594
where he'll decide
if the kids are ready to reunite.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.513
Nice.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.999
Really nice.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.914
No, this is...

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.896
You weren't gonna share that with us?

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.911
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.117
I mean, the tantrums,
the messes, the attitude.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.112
I have played 150 games
of Candy Land with Lita.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.633
You ever play fricking Candy Land?

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.358
- It's brutal!
- It's very dull.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.510
We're making connections. Okay/2

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.120
I just taught Lita how to ride a bike,

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.555
Juan and I bonded over Rocky Ill.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.312
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.871
Pete, Ellie...

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.678
I understand yourfrustration.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.478
But we all need to keep in mind
that until the kids are adopted,

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.236
the primary goal of the system
is family preservation.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.040
- And what about preserving our family?
- Yeah.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.190
Nothing has been decided yet.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.158
All right, October, that leaves you.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.312
Well, I have gotten a placement.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.351
He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.193
But he is 5'2".

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.192
And white, with red hair.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.989
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.799
I get it. My problems seem stupid now.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.348
Why do I always have to go last?

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.469
Stop.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.516
Okay. I know. It's...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.911
It's very unprofessional.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.155
This is the opposite of a support group.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.639
What am I gonna look like?

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.996
You're gonna look like
a beautiful princess.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.632
Do I look like a flower?

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.995
Hey. Hey, buddy.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.674
- Mom. Hey, kids.
- Oh! Hi, honey!

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.795
Hey.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.077
- Mom!
- No, it's totally washable.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.037
- It's...
- That's a Sharpie.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.156
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.240
Mom.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.834
Can you please get off the counter, honey?
It's dangerous.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.789
- How was care group?
- So much fun.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.314
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.630
- You're pregnant?
- Oh, my God!

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.790
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm sorry. No?

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.836
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.790
Okay.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.668
We are going to adopt through foster care,
just like you guys!

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.115
I mean, we did not get it at first,

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.079
and then we met yours and saw
what a wonderful choice it was.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.071
Hell of a lot cheaper than in-vitro too.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.233
Which is not the reason, but it's
a reason, if you're weighing factors.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.276
And we start classes next week!

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.318
What do you guys think?

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.193
I think...

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.514
I think I have to take a crap.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.216
That's not the reaction
we were looking for on that.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.992
She's jealous!

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.310
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.073
- What's going on?
- Please give this to me. Lizzy!

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.096
- You're not allowed to take my phone!
- What's she doing?

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.270
God! She's taking naked selfies
in the bathroom!

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.816
- She's taking naked selfies of herself?
- What're you doing to my phone?

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.912
Deleting everything here!
Delete, delete, delete.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.856
How many photos did you take?
What's wrong with you?

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.632
Everyone does it! It's no big deal!

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.039
It's a big huge giant deal!

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.315
Fifteen-year-old girls
should never be naked, ever!

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.790
- Can you take the door?
- Don't read my texts! Open the door!

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.872
"If you don't show me something soon,
I might lose interest."

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.520
- What? Who is this person, Lizzy?
- Open the door!

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.956
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Dick pic! There's a dick pic!

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.034
Come on, kids,
we are going in the living room.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.896
Is this that kid Jacob
you were talking about?

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.718
That sweet kid from school
is sending you photos of his beeswax?

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.870
Jesus, that is a trout!

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.154
Get out of here!

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.390
- Lizzy!
- Get out here now!

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.829
Give me the phone! Let go!

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.993
This is not cool, Lizzy!

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.799
I don't have to listen to you anymore,
Pretend Mom!

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.232
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.839
Our foster kids aren't gonna act
like that. That's on you guys.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.473
What exactly is a dick pic?

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.039
What do you think it is, Mom?

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.429
Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.719
You know, honey,
when I had... times like this,

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.950
I had to search myself

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.036
and remember...

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.715
why I became a mother in the first place.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.191
And that was helpful.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.596
Is this that kid Jacob's house?
Is that where we're going?

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.870
Just calm down, okay?

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.016
Please tell me where we are.
I don't want to get arrested.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.429
Will you just trust me? Come on.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.789
I don't know if you guys remember us,
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.836
- Oh, yeah.
- Hi. How you doing?

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.159
What can we do for you?

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.708
So now she wants to come back
and be Mommy again.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.631
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.950
I mean, Lizzy, she's treating us
like we're the enemy.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.680
So now we don't know what the hell to do.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.480
So I just thought, I mean,
your daughter turned out so great.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.879
Is she up there studying?

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.678
Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.588
I thought maybe we could speak with her,
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.951
- Is that a possibility?
- Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.917
We could use a pep talk right now.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.595
Brenda is... back in rehab.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.672
- Excuse me, what?
- We caught her using a couple months ago.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.753
Are you shitting me right nowfl

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.559
Her inspirational,
heartwarming, goddamn speech

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.677
is the reason we signed up
for this shit show in the first place!

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.318
Now you're telling me she's back on...

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.637
You listen to me, crazy woman!

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.631
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.553
ever since her mother's boyfriend
started her on meth when she was 11.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.232
Sometimes she stumbles.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.435
But she is a good kid,

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.398
and she's in there doing the work,
getting herself clean.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.436
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.748
And this has you feeling what?

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.229
Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.350
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything,
but yes, that's basically how we feel.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.477
That's how your children feel
every day of their lives.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.678
When you took this on,

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.639
you felt good about yourself
because you knew that it mattered, right?

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.991
Well, guess what.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.631
Things that matter are hard.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.557
Now I know where Brenda
gets her inspiring speech thing.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.154
Listen, guys,
right now, you're all theyve got.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.233
So your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.719
Wow.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.554
He's got it too.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.628
That was incredible. Thank you.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.390
- I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.
- I'm sorry I slapped you!

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.471
I know! That was crazy!

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.397
I know. lapologize.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.999
It was good. I needed it.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.672
I haven't been slapped for a long time.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.354
It was a bit aggressive.
It was a little bit out of line.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.998
Well, you were, honey.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.071
All right, honey, we gotta go.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.151
- We gotta get going.
- Take care.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.872
Thank you.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.599
You're on Facebook, right?
I'll find you. Okay!

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.114
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.315
Bye.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.039
Let's get in the house
right away, really quick.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.714
- Okay, you're all set.
- Bye, Lizzy.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.870
Bye, Lizzy. Have a great day.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.232
All right, look, you drop them off.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.776
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid
and get to the bottom of this, okay?

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.869
- Okay.
- All right.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.951
Wait, Pete, that's him!

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.032
Him? That redhead kid right there?
The kid with the soup can for a...?

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.189
Come on. I'm getting him.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.708
You! Dick pic! Hey!

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.074
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.430
What's up, man?
Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.396
Dick pic!

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.392
Think it's okay? Sending pictures
of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.755
You're lucky I don't end your life
right now, carrot top.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.960
I saw what you wrote to her:

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.096
"If you don't show me something,
I'm gonna lose interest."

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.714
That's actually sexual assault, young man.
It's disgusting!

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.949
Not such a big man now, are you?
Come on, whip it out!

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.216
Show everybody those big
shaved plums you're so proud of!

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.096
We're gonna call your mom, tell the
principal and maybe even call the police.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.759
- What do you think of that, Jacob?
- My name's not Jacob!

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.998
- What?
- My name is Charlie.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.440
- I thought you said his name was Jacob.
Really?

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.831
And my plums aren't shaved

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.360
or big.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.116
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.800
Come on, buddy, suck it up.
It's a little snafu, okay?

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.598
Come on. Give me a hug, Chartie.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.432
All right, look at me.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.160
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.560
who might be hanging around
with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.629
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.296
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, let's get the janitor.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.595
- Hey, I'm so sorry about this.
- Ellie, come on!

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.795
Thank you so much!

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.074
He didn't do any of that.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.536
- Come on, Ellie.
- He didn't do any of it!

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.869
- Hurry up!
- I'm so sorry, Charlie!

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.758
I think we're gonna be late for school.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.872
He's on a Zamboni.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.075
Come on!

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.680
Hey!

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.988
Hey, you!

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.638
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.776
- How old are you, Jump Street?
- Why do you want to know?

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.314
- Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours.
- He's 22!

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.710
- Yeah, I'm 22. So what?
- So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.594
Hey, you ever touch, text
or think about our daughter ever again,

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.680
and you're a dead man.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.776
I'm gonna sue you, man!
You're not even her parents!

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.119
Would not-her-parents do this?

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.070
Miss Peppers!

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.798
Whoa. What's happening here?

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.758
This man has been sending lewd
comments and photos to our daughter.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.559
- You're going to jail today, Jacob!
- You mind calling the police?

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.993
- Hurry up!
Absolutely!

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.589
Miss Peppers!

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.993
Motherfu...

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.556
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.791
- Bye-bye, scumbag.
- Filthy pedophile.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.348
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.271
You're arresting us? The guy was
sending pictures of his knob to a minor.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.511
- Why are you arresting us?
- Really good. Good work, guys.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.190
For what it's worth,
I heard what you guys did in there.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.356
You're good parents,
looking out for your kids.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.874
- If I'd had a chance to do the same...
- The kids! Oh, my God!

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.952
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.356
Hey. Hey, baby.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.993
My God, it's so clean.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.355
Well, there are my little gangsters.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.792
Posting bail for my Petey.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.711
Really took me back to the good old days.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.916
- Thank you, by the way.
- Where are the kids?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.673
Karen had to take them
to a temporary placement for the night.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.876
She said it's the first time
she's heard of CPS

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.918
removing kids from their adoptive home
the night before their hearing.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.319
Speaking of which,

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.077
I found your statement
to the judge on your printer.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.036
Needs some work.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.435
Mom, it's too late.
We submitted it last week.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.317
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.759
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.150
whether that means staying with us
or returning to their birth mother."

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.108
What if the judge reads
that crap in front of Lizzy/.7

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.616
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.677
If she thinks our statement's the reason
her mom doesn't get custody,

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.796
she's gonna hate us
more than she does now.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.713
She doesn't hate you.
She just thinks you don't love her.

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.832
And that statement ain't gonna help.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.519
Did Lizzy tell you that?

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.910
Come on, Ellie.
I grew up a lot like that kid.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.912
You get reminded what a sack
of shit you are five times a day,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.479
after a while,

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.869
you can't believe anyone
could ever love you.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.197
You know that we love you, right?

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.309
No.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.038
But that's not you, it's me.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.633
I thought I just covered all that.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.671
But I do love you both.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.352
Get some sleep, kids.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.830
After you fix that god-awful statement.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.634
Wow.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.355
It's so clean and quiet in here.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.919
I know.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.433
I hate it.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.839
Me too.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.274
âª 42::-

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.840
- Guys.
- We are so sorry.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.558
We are so sorry. Are you okay/.2

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.272
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.316
You did? Was that fun?

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.719
Did you guys go to prison?

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.314
No. We were... just in jail.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.556
Juan. Lita. Come on.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.268
- Mom's here.
- Okay.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.631
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now
a Change of Circumstance hearing

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.314
for a Miss Carla Viara.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.868
- And you are Miss Viara, yes?
- She is, Your Honor.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.794
And also with us today
are Juan, Lita and Elizabeth Viara?

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.711
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.759
- Yes!
- Those are good ones.

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.749
- And you are Elizabeth?
- It's Lizzy, sir.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.273
I mean, Your Honor.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.238
And Lizzy, I understand that
you've submitted a statement.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.150
And the foster parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.559
are they present as well?

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.793
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.438
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.432
is it accurate that you left
Juan and Lita alone in your car

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.034
while you were being arrested
for aggravated assault?

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.032
- Well, that...
- Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.918
Sir, all I need to know
is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.755
No, she's not lying.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.792
And prior to that assault,

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.953
did you acoost a 14-year-old honor student
in the same school yard

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.717
and encourage him
"to whip out his big shaved plums"?

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.038
I said that, Your Honor,

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.588
but again I thought it was
the person who sent her the...

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.515
And Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time
force Lizzy's friends to leave your home

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.079
by way of a bedroom window?

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.550
- It was a ground floor window.
- Good. Points for you.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.868
And at that same occasion,

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.635
did you tell Lizzy to call CPS
and to come and take the kids?

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.790
- She didn't mean that.
- I did not mean that.

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.598
That was in the heat of an argument.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.911
- Your Honor, 1 have a statement...
- Yes, I've read it, thank you.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.436
- No, we actually wrote a new one.
- Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.336
Please, Your Honor,
we were up late working on it.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.588
I can read it very fast.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.670
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.751
And at the time,
we couldn't answer her..."

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.398
Ma'am, please sit down.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.552
Please, Your Honor,
can you let me say the answer?

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.312
No. Sit.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.516
This hearing is not about you.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.797
Judging by Lizzys statement,
you might be back in court soon enough,

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.599
so let's save that heartwarming speech
for that occasion.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
Okay.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.191
Now, Miss Viara,

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.475
I see that you've been
keeping up with your visits.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.754
That's good.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.673
I also understand that you've been sober
for the last five months.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Is that still the case?

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.995
- Yes.
- That's very good news.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.909
And if I were to put the kids
in your care,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.753
your current residence
could accommodate them?

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.879
I think so.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.269
It's small, but it works,

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.759
Your Honor.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.239
And Miss Viara,

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.750
do you feel capable of responsibly caring
for Juan, Lita and Lizzy at this time?

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.668
Miss Viara.

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:38.949
Mama.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.714
Yes, Your Honor.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.594
I'm capable now.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.671
Everybody get ready for dinner.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.348
Here you go.

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.550
What if when we go live with our mom,

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.556
she doesn't know how to make my noodles
the way I like to have them?

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.456
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her
the way we do the cheese for you

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.600
so your mom can make it
for you just the way you like.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.954
Come on, guys.
Don't be sad on our last night, huh?

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:46.634
You know what? I think we should tell
Pete and Ellie thank you,

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.109
you know, for everything
they've done for us, yeah?

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560
Thank you.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.952
- Thank you, pal.
- Yeah, thank you, guys.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.873
- Lita?
- I don't want to say anything.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.393
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.234
I mean, unless you want to.

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:14.756
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.319
Come on, buddy.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.960
You haven't touched your pasta.
You want me to reheat it for you?

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.959
It's okay, buddy.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.996
That's okay, buddy.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:44.350
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.195
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.474
I love you too.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.673
Okay, all your court bears are in here,
the new ones as well.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.070
Speaking of court...

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.231
I just wanted to apologize
for what I wrote to the judge.

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.639
It was all true.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.917
Yeah, it was a little out of context
maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.789
Actually, I wanted to give you
the statement we wrote

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.154
that we couldn't read in court,

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.992
just so you have it.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.595
Yeah.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.155
Guys, Mom's here!

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.437
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.191
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.633
Bye, Meatball.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.560
Hey.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.274
I've got a car seat for Lita
if you don't have one.

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.634
You guys picking us up?

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640
Where's Mom?

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.870
She was supposed to meet us
at the office this morning

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.439
and she didn't show.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960
Oh, no.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.871
She didn't answer her phone.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.016
Did you go to her house?
What if something happened to her?

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.439
Yes, we went to see her.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.195
She was very ashamed.
She said... she can't do it.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.193
No, she didn't. Because
why would she... fill out all the forms

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.456
and the court stuff
and reunification stuff if she didn't...

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.790
Lizzy, your mom said
you filled out all those forms.

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.154
I helped, but so what?

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.199
She felt she was being pushed
into something she wasn't ready for.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.430
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.114
Just let me talk to her, please,

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.033
and then we can figure something out...

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.031
- Honey.
- And she can take me home.

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.556
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640
She's using again.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.158
She's not coming, baby.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.432
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.389
Lizzy.

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.713
Lizzy.

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.796
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.714
- Just wait there, okay?
- Lizzy!

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.915
Lizzy!

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.669
Lizzy!

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.238
As};
3&5er

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.999
- Lizzy.
- Please go away. You're not my parents.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.395
No, we're not, but you know what we are?
We're here.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.630
That's right, we're here and we love you.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.472
What?

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.232
No, you don't. You don't even know me.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.595
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.353
Could you just give us
a few minutes, please?

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.359
Oh, okay. Sorry.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.592
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.036
We know that you hate cheese,

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.554
but you really love cheeseburgers.

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.234
And we know that when
you feel good in the morning,

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.392
you put on a little less makeup
than you do on the bad days.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.376
Exactly. And look, we know that the most
important thing in the world to you

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.161
is to protect Juan and Lita
from the things nobody protected you from.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.156
- We know that about you, right?
- Yes, honey.

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.355
You guys are doing good.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.879
- I'm sorry.
- We know there's so much we don't know,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.118
but if you're afraid we can't handle
knowing the bad stuff, or the scary stuff,

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.758
we can, I promise.

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.189
Yeah, bring it. I mean,
whatever you got, we want it.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.793
Because we love you, Lizzy.

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.996
Stop saying that.

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.310
Please just go away, please.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.071
Please.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.995
- Is Lizzy okay?
- She's a little upset right now, buddy.

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.479
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.595
Here she is.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.798
So...

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.477
Here's what I think is best.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.873
I know Juan and Lita
are more like what you had in mind

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.837
- when you got into this.
- Come on, baby.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.152
So I think the best thing
is for you to adopt them.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:09.314
And... I'll just ask Karen
for a different placement.

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:11.836
It'll be good.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.673
No, honey. We need your help
with Juan and Lita.

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.056
We're not doing this without you.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.834
I'll visit all the time and you can
call me if you need help for anything.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.750
No.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:23.354
Pete, I really don't want
to argue about this right now.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.910
I don't care. I said no.
That's not happening, okay?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.149
- You're with us now.
- Yeah.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.629
And you know why/.9
We've got a cosmic connection.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.376
That's right, we've got
a cosmic connection.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.136
I know you feel sorry for me right now,
but you really don't have to...

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.549
It's got nothing to do
with what just happened.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.320
Where's the court statement
Ellie gave you?

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.437
See this? Read that.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.239
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this,
why we took them in.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.591
We couldn't give her
an answer at the time.

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.875
We did it because something
was missing in our lives,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.195
but we didn't know what it was.

01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.114
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.633
You see?

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.516
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.514
But now you're here
and you are stuck with us.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.430
That's right.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.351
We're gonna be at every soccer game.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.749
We're gonna be all over your ass
about your grades.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.336
And we're gonna buy you
yourfirst prom dress.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.032
Yeah, and it's gonna be really pretty.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.792
You know, not too sexy.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.678
Just like... really
that gorgeous sweet spot.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.398
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.516
we're gonna be in the front row
embarrassing you.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.096
Then we're gonna be in the front row again
when you graduate college too,

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120
or even if you don't.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.096
But you will be graduating college, 'cause
it's so important and you're so smart.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.953
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up
so many more opportunities.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.632
But either way,

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.199
we're gonna be there for you.

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.794
And someday I'm gonna
give you away at your wedding.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.316
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and
he's not good enough for my little girl.

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.472
That's right, someday in the future.
Someday in the way, way, way, way off,

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.597
deep, deep, deep distant future.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.909
Lizzy, can we go home now?

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.239
Yeah, I guess we can.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.119
I know you don't like this,

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.994
but you're gonna have to get
used to it once in a while, okay?

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.035
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single
hug from you since I've known you.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.680
Please?

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.593
Hi. I don't know
the whole context of everything,

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.715
but I'm just wondering

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.872
if I can just get in
on that hug a little bit.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.599
We're good! Thank you so much.
We're good, thank you.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.593
Sorry. That was just wrong.
Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.079
I crossed a boundary there.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.628
Everything's gonna work out great too.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.358
I can tell.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.400
Hi!

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:00.479
Oh, thank you!

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.791
ESQ;

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.472
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.513
Yeah. Why?

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.192
Do you guys want to come in?

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.553
I made a pie.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.959
- No, thank you.
- Yesl

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.395
- Karen!
- It's pie. You know I love pie.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.755
Great. Yeah, I just...

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.956
I have so many feelings.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.474
Go potty, put your shoes on.
We're gonna go, okay?

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.600
Okay!

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.272
Whoa, Juan. What are you doing, buddy?

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.256
You can't wear sneakers.
We gotta look good today.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.191
Mom, have you seen my phone?

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:14.670
No.

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.557
Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:18.835
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.592
- I went potty!
- Okay, good job.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.477
Everybody go potty!
- Yeah, I went potty.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.856
- Got that packet we're supposed to bring?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.632
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go.

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.033
I'm gonna beat you!

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.536
- No distracted driving, okay?
- All right.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.560
All right?

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.636
- She's gonna drive.
- Oh, yeah?

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.790
Yes, but I have the phone
and I'll sit in the front

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.429
in case I have to grab the wheel
or shut down the power, okay?

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.389
Sandy, come on, it's started!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.797
- Did I make it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.429
What's that?

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.280
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.759
You got a T-shirt?

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.993
You got a T-shirt?

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.120
You may all be seated.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.029
Good morning, folks.

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.311
- You know, family court is important...
- Wait. Wait!

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.558
Wait!

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.235
Grandma Sandy's in the house.
We can begin.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.993
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.036
- These seats are saved.
- Yeah, saved for me.

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:30.348
Move over.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.873
Stop it!

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.634
- Go ahead, Judge.
- Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.279
She got a T-shirt.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.119
You know, family court is important work.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.439
But it's difficult work.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.151
We spend day in and day out
dealing with things

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.754
that we feel no family
should have to go through.

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.039
So on these rare days
when we get to smile at work,

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.079
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:00.950
And I may not look it,
but I'm a huge cornball

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.473
and I live for this.

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:03.989
Ronit?

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.908
Yeah!

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.672
I love this song!

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.469
We are here today
to officially create a new family.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.598
Peter and Elinore Wagner,

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:24.515
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita and Lizzy
into your family today?

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.275
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.716
It's just the song
that's got me a little emotional.

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.795
Juan, Lita and Lizzy,

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.678
would you like Peter and Elinore
to be your mom and dad?

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.519
Sure.

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.630
- Yes, please.
- Yes!

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:43.709
Well, then,

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.071
by the authority vested in me
by the state of California,

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.439
I pronounce you a family.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.079
Yeah!

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.760
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.910
Would you like to take
a picture with the judge?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.911
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.799
That's gonna be us soon.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.395
I'm part of this family too.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.553
- Okay, thank you.
- Wait, me too!

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.108
- I'd like to be in the picture.
- Are you sure? We're not...

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.714
We should all go.
I think they'd like that.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:30.756
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:42.995
Okay! Okay.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.752
Anybody else?

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.751
Yeah, you too. Come on!

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.591
Okay, I think that's everybody.

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.434
- Say "family".
- Family!

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:55.440
- Say "family".
- Family!
