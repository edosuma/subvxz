00:22.592 --> 00:27.319
<font color="#11FF11">Once upon a time,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a long, long time ago,</font>

00:27.320 --> 00:30.959
<font color="#11FF11">well, about seven weeks ago,</font>

00:30.960 --> 00:34.959
<font color="#11FF11">four judges,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">including one very handsome one,</font>

00:34.960 --> 00:36.959
<font color="#11FF11">let's call him David,</font>

00:36.960 --> 00:40.479
<font color="#11FF11">set off on an epic journey</font>
<font color="#11FF11">around the country</font>

00:40.480 --> 00:43.639
<font color="#11FF11">to find talent fit for royalty,</font>

00:43.640 --> 00:45.959
<font color="#11FF11">whilst perching</font>
<font color="#11FF11">their pretty little bottoms</font>

00:45.960 --> 00:47.959
<font color="#11FF11">behind a big, white, shiny desk.</font>

00:47.960 --> 00:50.480
<font color="#00FFFF">That was an amazing performance.</font>
Hold on a minute!

00:52.960 --> 00:54.960
It's always been a dream
to be on the Royal Variety Show.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.960
The kids had a dream
and here we are.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, good Lord!</font>

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That was actually terrifying.</font>

01:04.959 --> 01:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That was pretty incredible.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That's never happened on any show.</font>

01:08.960 --> 01:11.800
<font color="#11FF11">But some of the acts</font>
<font color="#11FF11">weren't very good.</font>

01:15.160 --> 01:17.959
Who bought you that bowtie?
<font color="#FFFF00">You did, you fool.</font>

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
BUZZER

01:18.961 --> 01:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">And the evil judge,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">let's call him Simon...</font>

01:22.960 --> 01:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That's not a horse.</font>
Neigh.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.159
<font color="#11FF11">..Simon got cross.</font>

01:27.160 --> 01:30.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Every part of it made me feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">physically sick. </font>Sorry.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.960
<font color="#11FF11">He looks very handsome</font>
<font color="#11FF11">when he's angry.</font>

01:34.960 --> 01:39.960
<font color="#11FF11">And it was foretold that some</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of them would be showered with gold.</font>

01:51.960 --> 01:57.959
<font color="#11FF11">And tonight, it's time</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for the judges to reveal all,</font>

01:57.960 --> 02:02.160
<font color="#11FF11">as we tell you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who is in the semifinals.</font>

02:03.960 --> 02:05.959
<font color="#11FF11">We've got to make</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the right decision.</font>

02:05.960 --> 02:07.799
<font color="#11FF11">We've got to find a great winner.</font>

02:07.800 --> 02:10.603
<font color="#00FFFF">This is something that would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be amazing at the Royal Variety.</font>

02:10.604 --> 02:12.604
<font color="#11FF11">Do you think this act</font>
<font color="#11FF11">could ever win?</font>

02:12.605 --> 02:13.605
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

02:13.606 --> 02:17.285
<font color="#FFFF00">There are only 40 spots left.</font>

02:18.605 --> 02:19.605
<font color="#11FF11">We've come to a decision.</font>

02:20.605 --> 02:22.605
<font color="#FFFF00">You're through to the live shows.</font>

02:42.285 --> 02:44.605
<font color="#11FF11">TM is en route.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Repeat, TM is en route.</font>

02:54.605 --> 02:56.645
<font color="#11FF11">The judges are in place.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We're ready for the first act.</font>

03:00.479 --> 03:02.604
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, I've got high hopes for today.</font>

03:02.605 --> 03:05.604
<font color="#11FF11">TM is approaching the stage.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Cue track.</font>

03:05.605 --> 03:09.605
MUSIC: 'Dancing Queen'

03:11.805 --> 03:13.605
<font color="#11FF11">Theresa! Yes, Theresa!</font>

03:15.605 --> 03:17.604
# You can dance

03:17.605 --> 03:20.604
# You can jive

03:20.605 --> 03:23.604
Having the time of your life

03:23.605 --> 03:27.604
# Oooh, see that girl

03:27.605 --> 03:29.604
# Watch that scene

03:29.605 --> 03:32.124
# Digging the dancing queen... #

03:32.125 --> 03:34.605
FANFARE

03:44.605 --> 03:45.605
<font color="#00FFFF">Prime Minister!</font>

04:00.605 --> 04:03.285
<font color="#00FFFF">Prime Minister!</font>

04:12.605 --> 04:15.605
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

04:21.964 --> 04:23.605
<font color="#11FF11">I can't ever unsee that.</font>

04:24.965 --> 04:27.605
<font color="#FFFF00">She's unbelievable.</font>

04:29.418 --> 04:32.097
<font color="#FFFF00">The fact that you've come on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and you've chosen our show,</font>

04:32.098 --> 04:34.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I think is amazing. And I really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">appreciate you for doing that.</font>

04:34.418 --> 04:36.417
<font color="#FFFF00">It means an awful lot.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you.</font>

04:36.418 --> 04:37.458
<font color="#FFFF00">I think we've got to know you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">better.</font>

04:39.418 --> 04:43.617
<font color="#11FF11">It was one of the most fun things</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I've ever seen in my life.</font>

04:43.618 --> 04:46.418
<font color="#11FF11">And if this doesn't solve Brexit,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know what will.</font>

04:49.418 --> 04:52.777
<font color="#00FFFF">I've been so uncomfortable watching</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Theresa dance lately. Haven't you?</font>

04:52.778 --> 04:56.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, when she was in Africa</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and she was... Do remember that one?</font>

04:56.418 --> 04:57.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

04:57.419 --> 04:59.417
LAUGHTER

04:59.418 --> 05:00.418
<font color="#00FFFF">It's just brilliant.</font>

05:00.419 --> 05:02.417
<font color="#11FF11">I'm going to say yes.</font>

05:02.418 --> 05:04.097
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

05:04.098 --> 05:07.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you for choosing our show.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You are through to the next round.</font>

05:07.418 --> 05:09.418
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:15.418 --> 05:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, Prime Minister!</font>

05:17.418 --> 05:19.417
They're in.
<font color="#11FF11">They're in... just about!</font>

05:19.418 --> 05:21.418
<font color="#00FFFF">That was a weird start.</font>

05:28.418 --> 05:30.417
<font color="#11FF11">What are you doing for us, John?</font>

05:30.418 --> 05:32.417
I'm going to do some magic.
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, brilliant.</font>

05:32.418 --> 05:33.418
<font color="#11FF11">We love magic.</font>

05:33.419 --> 05:35.777
<font color="#FFFF00">A funny start to the show, you know.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

05:35.778 --> 05:37.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Bring on the next one.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's go, let's go.</font>

05:37.418 --> 05:39.418
<font color="#11FF11">Onto the star. Have some fun.</font>

05:44.418 --> 05:46.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello, sir.</font>

05:46.418 --> 05:49.417
<font color="#00FFFF">How are you? </font>Er, yeah,
I was all right over there.

05:49.418 --> 05:51.417
But, yeah, I'm all right.
I'm good.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.417
It's nice to be here.
<font color="#00FFFF">What's your name?</font>

05:53.418 --> 05:54.418
My name's John Archer.

05:54.419 --> 05:56.417
<font color="#00FFFF">How old are you, John,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if you don't mind my asking?</font>

05:56.418 --> 05:59.417
I'm a little bit younger than Simon.
LAUGHTER

05:59.418 --> 06:01.417
58.

06:01.418 --> 06:03.417
<font color="#00FFFF">So, why Britain's Got Talent now?</font>

06:03.418 --> 06:05.417
I have thought about it
and I've chickened out.

06:05.418 --> 06:08.417
And I got to the point this year I
thought, face your fears and do it.

06:08.418 --> 06:11.418
And so... I'm here.
<font color="#00FFFF">OK.</font>

06:15.418 --> 06:18.417
Do you know what, this is going
to sound bad, but I, erm...

06:18.418 --> 06:22.418
..I've been doing this for 23 years
and, erm...

06:23.418 --> 06:26.417
..and my wife and my family...

06:26.418 --> 06:28.417
AUDIENCE: <font color="#FFFF00">Aw...</font>
I'm all right. No, don't do that.

06:28.418 --> 06:29.777
LAUGHTER

06:29.778 --> 06:33.417
My wife and my family have missed
out on me because I've got a gig

06:33.418 --> 06:36.417
and my kids have missed out on Dad
when I'm away.

06:36.418 --> 06:40.417
And I really just want...
I want to make them proud. I just...

06:40.418 --> 06:42.457
I know it sounds corny, but...
<font color="#00FFFF">No, it doesn't at all.</font>

06:42.458 --> 06:44.417
Erm...

06:44.418 --> 06:47.417
<font color="#11FF11">It doesn't sound corny at all, John.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It sounds lovely.</font>

06:47.418 --> 06:50.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Have you brought anyone with you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from your family today?</font>

06:50.418 --> 06:52.417
No, I haven't,
because they'd make me too nervous

06:52.418 --> 06:56.417
if they were here, really.
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, listen, John, just go for it.</font>

06:56.418 --> 06:58.417
I will, I will. <font color="#00FFFF">Wishing you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all the best of luck.</font>

06:58.418 --> 06:59.418
Thank you very much.

07:01.418 --> 07:03.417
Thank you very much.
It's great to be here.

07:03.418 --> 07:06.097
This evening, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to do a trick.

07:06.098 --> 07:07.457
And I need somebody to come up
and help me.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.417
And, David, that's going to be you.

07:09.418 --> 07:11.417
Would you mind coming up
and joining me?

07:11.418 --> 07:14.418
Give David a big round of applause.
APPLAUSE

07:15.418 --> 07:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">Hello. </font>Excellent.
Good to see you, David.

07:17.418 --> 07:19.937
Now, so, what we're going to do,
David,

07:19.938 --> 07:22.257
is in this bag is a prediction.
It's a drink.

07:22.258 --> 07:24.617
In a moment, you're going to choose
a drink from one of these cards.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.417
You could have wine,
you could have tea, you can beer,

07:27.418 --> 07:29.417
you could have milk,
you could have cola,

07:29.418 --> 07:32.418
you could have vodka,
you could have orange...

07:34.418 --> 07:36.417
LAUGHTER

07:36.418 --> 07:39.417
Now, I need to let the audience in
on how the trick works.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.417
So would you do me a favour and
turn and face that corner for me?

07:42.418 --> 07:44.417
That's wonderful.

07:44.418 --> 07:45.937
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the drink

07:45.938 --> 07:47.938
that I think David
is about to choose.

07:49.098 --> 07:50.417
OK?

07:50.418 --> 07:52.457
Now, what happens,
I've got to mix these cards up

07:52.458 --> 07:56.418
so that David hasn't got a clue
where all the different...

07:58.418 --> 08:00.777
LAUGHTER

08:00.778 --> 08:04.417
I'm not used to working
in such a big venue, to be honest.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.457
Actually, I'm not used to working!

08:05.458 --> 08:07.417
David, you can turn round now.

08:07.418 --> 08:11.257
Wonderful. I just want you to touch
one of the cards for me, David.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.417
And whichever card you touch
is the drink that we will choose.

08:13.418 --> 08:15.417
What, this one here?
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah.</font>

08:15.418 --> 08:17.257
Can you hold your hand out flat
for me?

08:17.258 --> 08:19.417
I'm going to place this card
on your hand. Excellent.

08:19.418 --> 08:21.417
Now, in a nice, loud voice,

08:21.418 --> 08:24.417
would you read out the name
of the drink that you selected?

08:24.418 --> 08:25.418
<font color="#11FF11">Cola.</font>

08:25.419 --> 08:28.418
LAUGHTER

08:32.457 --> 08:34.258
Er...

08:37.457 --> 08:40.417
I suppose you want to see
my prediction, do you?

08:40.418 --> 08:42.418
It's cola, ladies and gentlemen!
There it is!

08:45.418 --> 08:47.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Wow!</font>

08:47.418 --> 08:50.257
Give him a tip.
LAUGHTER

08:50.258 --> 08:52.777
David, I'd like you to have
this bag.

08:52.778 --> 08:56.417
There you go. David Walliams,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:56.418 --> 08:59.098
<font color="#11FF11">Very good.</font>
Oh!

09:12.418 --> 09:15.417
<font color="#FFFF00">John, you know what? They don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make you like this any more.</font>

09:15.418 --> 09:18.417
<font color="#FFFF00">To get this reaction</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from this audience is amazing.</font>

09:18.418 --> 09:20.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Good for you.</font>

09:24.418 --> 09:28.417
<font color="#00FFFF">John, what I loved was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the Tommy Cooper retro thing</font>

09:28.418 --> 09:31.097
<font color="#00FFFF">that entertained</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thousands of people for years.</font>

09:31.098 --> 09:33.417
<font color="#00FFFF">And that is what</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Britain's Got Talent is all about.</font>

09:33.418 --> 09:35.418
Thank you very much.

09:37.938 --> 09:40.417
<font color="#11FF11">There's some comedians,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they just walk on</font>

09:40.418 --> 09:43.417
<font color="#11FF11">and you've already got a smile</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on your face</font>

09:43.418 --> 09:44.418
<font color="#11FF11">cos they just exude comedy.</font>

09:44.419 --> 09:47.417
<font color="#11FF11">And you're one of those people.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You are super, super funny.</font>

09:47.418 --> 09:49.417
Thank you very much.
<font color="#00FFFF">They've said it all, John.</font>

09:49.418 --> 09:51.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going to kick this off</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with a yes.</font>

09:51.418 --> 09:53.418
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a yes from me.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's a yes from me.</font>

09:55.418 --> 09:57.418
<font color="#FFFF00">You've got four yeses.</font>
Thank you very much.

09:59.418 --> 10:00.418
Thank you.

10:02.418 --> 10:03.778
<font color="#00FFFF">Love you, John!</font>

10:05.418 --> 10:07.417
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, John!</font>

10:07.418 --> 10:10.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, well done. Well done.</font>

10:10.418 --> 10:13.418
<font color="#FFFF00">I liked him as well.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Really funny.</font>

10:14.418 --> 10:16.417
No autographs. Get back!

10:16.418 --> 10:17.778
Get back! Get back!

10:23.418 --> 10:25.457
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, you there.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, you.</font>

10:25.458 --> 10:27.417

<font color="#FFFF00">with your phone</font>

10:27.418 --> 10:30.417

<font color="#11FF11">Now, it's fine. You can carry on.</font>

10:30.418 --> 10:33.417

# And we danced all night
To the best song ever

11:00.418 --> 11:04.417
# We knew every line
Now I can't remember

11:04.418 --> 11:08.417
# How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her

11:08.418 --> 11:12.417

To the best song ever... #

11:12.418 --> 11:14.418
<font color="#11FF11">Best of luck. All yours.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Raise the roof.</font>

11:17.458 --> 11:19.418
<font color="#00FFFF">That's a swagger.</font>

11:27.618 --> 11:29.417
<font color="#FFFF00">David...</font>

11:29.418 --> 11:30.418
<font color="#FFFF00">David!</font>

11:30.419 --> 11:33.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Sit down quickly.</font>

11:33.418 --> 11:35.777
<font color="#00FFFF">He's quite fit.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">All right, love!</font>

11:35.778 --> 11:37.417
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you?</font>

11:37.418 --> 11:40.417
I'm fine, guys. I'm fine.
<font color="#11FF11">Oh!</font>

11:40.418 --> 11:43.417
<font color="#FFFF00">What's your name, please?</font>
My name is Kyle.

11:43.418 --> 11:46.417
<font color="#FFFF00">And where are you from, Kyle?</font>
I'm from London, actually.

11:46.418 --> 11:49.417
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">And how old are you, Kyle?</font>

11:49.418 --> 11:50.418
I'm 35.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.417
<font color="#FFFF00">35? You're great.</font>

11:52.418 --> 11:55.417
<font color="#FFFF00">What's the secret?</font>
Water.

11:55.418 --> 11:56.617
<font color="#FFFF00">I knew you were going to say that!</font>

11:56.618 --> 11:59.457
<font color="#FFFF00">I had a feeling you were going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">say that. Kyle, why are you here?</font>

11:59.458 --> 12:02.417
I just like to show my talent.
<font color="#FFFF00">Good for you.</font>

12:02.418 --> 12:05.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I'm not going to ask you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any more questions. Best of luck.</font>

12:05.418 --> 12:07.418
<font color="#11FF11">Singer, obviously.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

12:11.418 --> 12:13.418
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, he's got a friend.</font>

12:15.418 --> 12:16.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Hit it.</font>

12:20.418 --> 12:26.417
# Hello from the other side

12:26.418 --> 12:28.097
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God, he's amazing.</font>

12:28.098 --> 12:32.417
# I must've called a thousand times
To tell...

12:32.418 --> 12:34.418
HE PLAYS SOME BAD NOTES
Whoa!

12:38.418 --> 12:40.938
Bruce, you can't.
This is...

12:42.418 --> 12:45.417
You know what? I need some help.
Guys, can you come and...?

12:45.418 --> 12:48.418
Let's raise the energy.
This is a workout.

12:49.418 --> 12:50.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

13:02.418 --> 13:03.418
<font color="#00FFFF">I loved that.</font>

13:16.418 --> 13:22.418
# Whoa, it feels good

13:24.418 --> 13:25.418
<font color="#11FF11">Well, well, well...</font>

13:26.418 --> 13:30.778
# Well, it feels good.

13:35.418 --> 13:37.418
# It feels good

13:50.098 --> 13:51.418
# It feels good. #

13:58.418 --> 14:00.418
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:03.258 --> 14:06.418
<font color="#11FF11">That was a cheeky surprise,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wasn't it? Wasn't it, ladies?</font>

14:15.418 --> 14:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">You never told me you had friends.</font>

14:17.418 --> 14:19.417
LAUGHTER

14:19.418 --> 14:21.417
<font color="#11FF11">It was amazing,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from start to finish.</font>

14:21.418 --> 14:24.417
<font color="#11FF11">All of you are super talented.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have a favourite.</font>

14:24.418 --> 14:25.418
<font color="#11FF11">I'll be honest about that.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I do.</font>

14:25.419 --> 14:27.617
LAUGHTER

14:27.618 --> 14:29.937
<font color="#00FFFF">I think that Simon has found</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">his dream dance act.</font>

14:29.938 --> 14:33.457
<font color="#00FFFF">He keeps saying, every time</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we get good dancers, "Can you sing?"</font>

14:33.458 --> 14:36.417
<font color="#00FFFF">And the fact that you do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and you did it well,</font>

14:36.418 --> 14:39.418
<font color="#00FFFF">well done, guys,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that was brilliant.</font>

14:42.418 --> 14:44.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I loved the curveball</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at the beginning.</font>

14:44.418 --> 14:46.417
<font color="#00FFFF">You're all really hot.</font>

14:46.418 --> 14:49.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The dancing was fantastic.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You look great.</font>

14:49.418 --> 14:53.417
<font color="#FFFF00">We always say a sense of humour</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is so important on a dance group.</font>

14:53.418 --> 14:56.417
<font color="#FFFF00">It's what Diversity had,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">they always had that imagination.</font>

14:56.418 --> 14:59.417
<font color="#FFFF00">And I thought</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a little bit of the choreography</font>

14:59.418 --> 15:03.417
<font color="#FFFF00">was a little boyband-ish.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think you're better than that.</font>

15:03.418 --> 15:05.417
<font color="#FFFF00">The great thing is we haven't seen</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an act like this</font>

15:05.418 --> 15:06.418
<font color="#FFFF00">for a long time on the show.</font>

15:06.419 --> 15:10.418
<font color="#FFFF00">So, I want to be the first that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">kicks it off with a big, fat yes.</font>

15:13.418 --> 15:15.418
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me.</font>

15:16.418 --> 15:18.418
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me.</font>

15:22.418 --> 15:25.417
<font color="#11FF11">It's a really big, fat, juicy yes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from me.</font>

15:25.418 --> 15:30.458
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:39.258 --> 15:40.417
<font color="#11FF11">Congratulations. Well done.</font>

15:40.418 --> 15:42.777
<font color="#11FF11">Well, that was a little surprising,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wasn't it?</font>

15:42.778 --> 15:45.417
Are all our voices warmed up?
Are we ready? <font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

15:45.418 --> 15:49.417
<font color="#11FF11">The judges are ready for you now,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you'd like to follow me.</font>

15:49.418 --> 15:51.417
This is it. Let's go.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
<font color="#11FF11">OK, cue the next act.</font>

16:02.418 --> 16:05.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello.</font>
Hello, hello.

16:05.418 --> 16:07.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Nice to meet you.</font>
And you.

16:07.418 --> 16:09.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Tell us who you are, please.</font>
Well, my name's Harry.

16:09.418 --> 16:10.777
<font color="#FFFF00">Harry, how old are you?</font>
18.

16:10.778 --> 16:12.417
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Theo, I'm 17.</font>

16:12.418 --> 16:14.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Josh, I'm 17.</font>

16:14.418 --> 16:16.417
I'm James and I'm 19.

16:16.418 --> 16:19.417
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:19.418 --> 16:20.618
<font color="#FFFF00">So, I'm going to guess...</font>

16:21.778 --> 16:23.417
<font color="#FFFF00">..singers or dancers.</font>

16:23.418 --> 16:25.457
We've got a little surprise.
<font color="#FFFF00">A surprise?</font>

16:25.458 --> 16:27.418
Yes.
<font color="#FFFF00">I like surprises.</font>

16:28.418 --> 16:30.418
<font color="#FFFF00">It's yours.</font>
OK.

16:32.418 --> 16:34.778
Ladies and gentlemen...

16:36.418 --> 16:39.417
..magic is all about mystery.

16:39.418 --> 16:42.417
And this right here
is what we consider to be

16:42.418 --> 16:44.418
the biggest mystery of all.

16:45.418 --> 16:47.417
David...
<font color="#11FF11">Hello.</font>

16:47.418 --> 16:50.417
Hello.
You have a part in this mystery.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.937
And your part
is to choose a playing card.

16:52.938 --> 16:56.417
First of all,
all the cards are different.

16:56.418 --> 16:57.418
<font color="#11FF11">Mm.</font>

16:57.419 --> 17:00.417
I'm going to place a rubber band
around the cards like this.

17:00.418 --> 17:04.416
All I want you to do is open up
wherever you like, like this,

17:04.417 --> 17:07.416
place the card in your hands...
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, hello! We've missed you.</font>

17:07.417 --> 17:09.416
So, just place your hand out for me

17:09.417 --> 17:11.416
and then look at the card
you've chosen.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.257
Have you got it?
<font color="#11FF11">Yes.</font>

17:13.258 --> 17:14.416
Thank you.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.416
<font color="#FFFF00">Alesha...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi.</font>

17:16.417 --> 17:18.416
<font color="#FFFF00">Over here, I have a pack of cards.</font>

17:18.417 --> 17:20.416
<font color="#FFFF00">You can see all of the cards</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are completely different.</font>

17:20.417 --> 17:24.097
<font color="#FFFF00">You're going to cut the cards</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to wherever you like into the pack.</font>

17:24.098 --> 17:25.416
<font color="#00FFFF">OK.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

17:25.417 --> 17:29.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Have a look at the card that you've</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just cut to just on the bottom</font>

17:29.418 --> 17:30.777
<font color="#FFFF00">and place the cards back.</font>

17:30.778 --> 17:32.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you.</font>

17:32.418 --> 17:33.617
Amanda,
I too have a deck of cards here.

17:33.618 --> 17:36.417
and as I drop cards to the table,
all I'd like you to do

17:36.418 --> 17:38.418
is just call the word stop for me
anywhere you like.

17:40.618 --> 17:43.257
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop.</font>
This next card is going to be yours.

17:43.258 --> 17:46.418
Please show everybody,
but don't let me see.

17:47.418 --> 17:50.417
<font color="#11FF11">Finally, Simon, as I run my finger</font>
<font color="#11FF11">down the side of the deck,</font>

17:50.418 --> 17:52.418
<font color="#11FF11">I'd also like you to tell me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to stop.</font>

17:53.418 --> 17:55.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Stop, please.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Right here, yeah?</font>

17:55.418 --> 17:58.937
<font color="#11FF11">So, Simon, the exact position</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you told me to stop at</font>

17:58.938 --> 18:01.417
<font color="#11FF11">was, in fact, on the seven of clubs.</font>

18:01.418 --> 18:02.418
<font color="#11FF11">Now, I'll leave the seven</font>
<font color="#11FF11">down there.</font>

18:02.419 --> 18:04.617
<font color="#11FF11">But before we go any further,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you could have stopped me</font>

18:04.618 --> 18:07.417
<font color="#11FF11">on any one of the cards, correct?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

18:07.418 --> 18:08.418
David.
<font color="#11FF11">Yes?</font>

18:08.419 --> 18:12.417
Just a moment ago, you randomly
selected one of these cards.

18:12.418 --> 18:14.097
<font color="#11FF11">Correct.</font>

18:14.098 --> 18:17.417
But I thought, wouldn't it be cool
if I could make your card...

18:17.418 --> 18:19.418
..fade away?

18:21.418 --> 18:24.418
You look a little bit confused.
<font color="#11FF11">I am generally.</font>

18:26.258 --> 18:29.097
But I'm not just going to make
one card fade away.

18:29.098 --> 18:32.417
I'm going to make 51 cards
fade away,

18:32.418 --> 18:35.617
leaving only one card
that still exists.

18:35.618 --> 18:39.937
David, for the first time,
please say your card out loud.

18:39.938 --> 18:41.417
<font color="#11FF11">The two of diamonds.</font>

18:41.418 --> 18:44.418
Ladies and gentlemen,
the two of diamonds!

18:49.938 --> 18:54.257
<font color="#FFFF00">Alesha, I knew exactly what card</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you were going to choose.</font>

18:54.258 --> 18:55.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Really?</font>

18:55.418 --> 18:58.417
<font color="#FFFF00">You see, no other card</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has a message, except for this one.</font>

18:58.418 --> 19:01.417
<font color="#FFFF00">For the first time, what is the card</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that you're thinking of?</font>

19:01.418 --> 19:03.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The seven of diamonds.</font>

19:03.418 --> 19:05.418
<font color="#FFFF00">The seven of diamonds!</font>

19:09.418 --> 19:11.417
Every time that I do this,

19:11.418 --> 19:13.417
people tend to think
I'm using slight of hand.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.417
What I'm going to do is place
all of the cards inside of the box

19:16.418 --> 19:18.417
so there's no way
I can manipulate anything here

19:18.418 --> 19:20.417
aside from the card on the table.
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

19:20.418 --> 19:22.417
So, if you have that card
firmly in your mind,

19:22.418 --> 19:24.417
I'm going to take it back from you.

19:24.418 --> 19:26.417
Now, bearing in mind
I haven't seen it,

19:26.418 --> 19:28.417
I'm going to slide it in amongst
the other 51 cards in the pack

19:28.418 --> 19:29.418
and then seal it up.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.457
I'm going to place all of the cards
into your palm

19:31.458 --> 19:33.417
and one by one by one,

19:33.418 --> 19:36.257
I want you to picture them
starting to leave the box.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.417
And, in fact, you should be able
to feel the box becoming lighter

19:38.418 --> 19:41.417
and lighter and lighter,

19:41.418 --> 19:43.417
until it feels as if there could
only be one card in there.

19:43.418 --> 19:45.937
Amanda, what would you do
if I told you

19:45.938 --> 19:48.417
that this wasn't just
your imagination

19:48.418 --> 19:50.417
and there genuinely
was only one card,

19:50.418 --> 19:55.098
with every other single card
now having left the box?

19:56.418 --> 19:59.417
Amanda,
you have one card in your mind.

19:59.418 --> 20:02.417
Would you please announce it out
loud? <font color="#00FFFF">It was the king of clubs.</font>

20:02.418 --> 20:04.418
It looks like
we have a perfect match.

20:09.418 --> 20:13.417
<font color="#11FF11">Now, Simon, before any of this</font>
<font color="#11FF11">began, James mentioned a mystery.</font>

20:13.418 --> 20:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">The mystery is in fact a sealed deck</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of cards within a glass bottle.</font>

20:17.418 --> 20:20.417
<font color="#11FF11">You'll notice one difference</font>
<font color="#11FF11">between the deck in the bottle</font>

20:20.418 --> 20:22.417
<font color="#11FF11">and the deck we've been using</font>
<font color="#11FF11">here tonight,</font>

20:22.418 --> 20:24.617
<font color="#11FF11">and that is the cards in the bottle</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have a gold back.</font>

20:24.618 --> 20:27.417
<font color="#11FF11">The cards we've been using over here</font>
<font color="#11FF11">tonight have a red back.</font>

20:27.418 --> 20:30.418
<font color="#11FF11">But watch closely, guys, because</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you're not going to believe this.</font>

20:34.418 --> 20:38.417
<font color="#11FF11">Simon, if I'm now holding</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the seven of clubs,</font>

20:38.418 --> 20:39.777
<font color="#11FF11">but that comes from that deck,</font>

20:39.778 --> 20:43.417
<font color="#11FF11">where has the card you've selected</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from this deck actually gone?</font>

20:43.418 --> 20:45.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, it can't...</font>

20:45.418 --> 20:47.257
<font color="#FFFF00">..have gone from there to there,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could it?</font>

20:47.258 --> 20:48.418
<font color="#11FF11">James...</font>

20:49.418 --> 20:54.418
We have no idea, genuinely, how this
deck of cards got inside the bottle.

20:56.418 --> 21:00.418
But we know that there is only
one way to get it out.

21:02.258 --> 21:03.418
David, watch out.

21:17.418 --> 21:18.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Be careful.</font>

21:23.418 --> 21:25.417
<font color="#FFFF00">And as you can all see,</font>

21:25.418 --> 21:27.417
<font color="#FFFF00">the deck is wrapped in cellophane</font>

21:27.418 --> 21:31.418
<font color="#FFFF00">and it is completely sealed.</font>

21:33.418 --> 21:39.098
<font color="#11FF11">Every single card is present,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">including the jokers.</font>

21:41.418 --> 21:45.417
<font color="#11FF11">Now, guys, you can see</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the deck is in perfect order.</font>

21:45.418 --> 21:47.417
<font color="#11FF11">Every single card,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from ace through to king,</font>

21:47.418 --> 21:49.417
<font color="#11FF11">being in the right place.</font>

21:49.418 --> 21:51.418
<font color="#11FF11">The deck is perfect in every way.</font>

21:53.418 --> 21:56.417
<font color="#11FF11">Apart from one.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Come on.</font>

21:56.418 --> 21:59.417
<font color="#11FF11">Now, everyone in here</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is thinking the same thing.</font>

21:59.418 --> 22:02.417
<font color="#11FF11">Can that possibly be your card?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

22:02.418 --> 22:05.417
<font color="#11FF11">Simon, for the first time, can you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">slide that card towards yourself.</font>

22:05.418 --> 22:08.417
<font color="#11FF11">And if that is your card,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the seven of clubs,</font>

22:08.418 --> 22:11.418
<font color="#11FF11">can you please hold it high</font>
<font color="#11FF11">above your head for everyone to see?</font>

22:13.418 --> 22:14.418
<font color="#FFFF00">It is.</font>

22:14.419 --> 22:18.418
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:21.098 --> 22:23.457
But, wait! Stop! Stop!

22:23.458 --> 22:27.417
This was always meant to be.

22:27.418 --> 22:32.417
In actual fact, Simon,
you chose the seven of clubs.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.417
Amanda, you chose the king of clubs.
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God...!</font>

22:35.418 --> 22:38.417
Alesha, you chose
the seven of diamonds.

22:38.418 --> 22:42.417
And, David,
you chose the two of diamonds!

22:42.418 --> 22:46.258
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:56.098 --> 22:57.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done, guys.</font>

22:57.418 --> 22:59.417
<font color="#FFFF00">David, what did you think?</font>

22:59.418 --> 23:03.097
<font color="#11FF11">Well, you're like the boyband</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of magic, aren't you?</font>

23:03.098 --> 23:05.417
<font color="#11FF11">I mean...</font>

23:05.418 --> 23:08.418
<font color="#11FF11">..it was dazzling, gentlemen.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Well done.</font>

23:10.418 --> 23:12.417
<font color="#00FFFF">You're very unique.</font>

23:12.418 --> 23:15.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The whole thing from start</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to finish, presentation-wise,</font>

23:15.418 --> 23:17.097
<font color="#00FFFF">was incredible.</font>

23:17.098 --> 23:18.417
<font color="#00FFFF">And at the end,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I felt quite emotional,</font>

23:18.418 --> 23:20.417
<font color="#00FFFF">cos I could see</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">how much it means to you.</font>

23:20.418 --> 23:23.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I really, really hope,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fingers crossed,</font>

23:23.418 --> 23:25.418
<font color="#00FFFF">this is the start</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of something special for you guys.</font>

23:27.458 --> 23:31.257
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, I'm noticing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">over the past few years</font>

23:31.258 --> 23:33.417
<font color="#FFFF00">that lots and lots of young people</font>

23:33.418 --> 23:36.417
<font color="#FFFF00">now want to go into</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this kind of area.</font>

23:36.418 --> 23:38.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I've never seen an act like this.</font>

23:38.418 --> 23:41.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Considering your age,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your experience, it was amazing.</font>

23:41.418 --> 23:43.778
<font color="#FFFF00">I really like you, guys.</font>
Thank you.

23:49.418 --> 23:51.418
<font color="#11FF11">Let me kick this off with a yes.</font>

23:53.418 --> 23:55.417
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me.</font>

23:55.418 --> 23:57.417
<font color="#11FF11">It's a yes from me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">For yeses.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Well done. Great work.</font>

24:13.418 --> 24:16.417
<font color="#11FF11">It's competition time.</font>

24:16.418 --> 24:18.938
<font color="#FFFF00">Fancy winning our showstopper</font>

<font color="#11FF11">and a £3,000 shopping trip.</font>

26:06.458 --> 26:09.418
<font color="#FFFF00">By the way,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this is not normal behaviour.</font>

26:14.418 --> 26:17.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's just let David</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have his moment.</font>

26:26.418 --> 26:28.418
<font color="#FFFF00">That was actually disturbing.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Mind your head!</font>

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

26:35.418 --> 26:37.417
So, girls, we need to smash it.

26:37.418 --> 26:40.417
Faces, lines,
everyone needs to be perfect.

26:40.418 --> 26:41.617
<font color="#00FFFF">What time is it?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We've got two acts left.</font>

26:41.618 --> 26:43.097
<font color="#00FFFF">Really?</font>

26:43.098 --> 26:45.258
Dance for your lives.

We're Funky Feet and we're from...

<font color="#FFFF00">OK, I'm going to guess</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're a dance group.</font>

27:08.938 --> 27:10.417
Yeah.

<font color="#FFFF00">OK, if you win 250 grand,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how do you split up the money?</font>

27:13.418 --> 27:15.937
It goes straight
to our dance school.

27:15.938 --> 27:19.417
So, we'll get our own tour bus,
like the Spice Girls.

27:19.418 --> 27:22.777

<font color="#FFFF00">can change your life.</font>

32:32.418 --> 32:36.417
# They have everything
For you men to enjoy

32:36.418 --> 32:39.417
# You can hang out with all the boys

32:39.418 --> 32:42.777
# It's fun to stay at the YMCA

32:42.778 --> 32:47.417
# It's fun to stay at the YMCA...

32:47.418 --> 32:48.618
# Whoa, gangnam style

32:51.418 --> 32:52.418
# Gangnam style

32:54.418 --> 32:56.417
# Whoa, gangnam style

32:56.418 --> 32:59.418
# Hey, sexy lady

33:01.618 --> 33:03.418
# Whoa, gangnam style...

33:05.418 --> 33:06.418
# Dance!

33:08.418 --> 33:10.418
# Boogie wonderland

33:11.418 --> 33:14.418
# Boogie wonderland. #

33:16.418 --> 33:20.258
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:27.778 --> 33:30.257
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, thank you, guys.</font>

33:30.258 --> 33:34.417
<font color="#11FF11">It was completely bonkers and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">completely Britain's Got Talent.</font>

33:34.418 --> 33:36.418
<font color="#11FF11">So, thank you.</font>

33:38.418 --> 33:43.457
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what, this is the sort</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of thing my son Eric would love.</font>

33:43.458 --> 33:46.417
<font color="#FFFF00">What a great end</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to the show this year.</font>

33:46.418 --> 33:47.618
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you.</font>

33:50.418 --> 33:56.257
<font color="#00FFFF">I loved it and I'm going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to kick it off with a big, fat...</font>

33:56.258 --> 33:57.418
<font color="#00FFFF">..woof!</font>

34:00.418 --> 34:01.938
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a woof from me.</font>

34:03.418 --> 34:05.418
<font color="#11FF11">It's a woof from me.</font>

34:06.418 --> 34:08.418
<font color="#FFFF00">You've got four woofs.</font>
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:11.418 --> 34:13.257
<font color="#11FF11">Thank goodness for that!</font>

34:20.418 --> 34:22.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on! Come on!</font>

34:30.257 --> 34:32.417
<font color="#00FFFF">We did it! We did it!</font>

34:32.418 --> 34:34.938
<font color="#00FFFF">After all these years!</font>

34:39.618 --> 34:42.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

34:42.418 --> 34:44.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't believe that!</font>

34:44.418 --> 34:45.418
<font color="#11FF11">And again!</font>

34:45.418 --> 34:47.458
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
<font color="#00FFFF">We're through!</font>

34:51.418 --> 34:54.417
<font color="#11FF11">That's it.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">That's Britain's Got Talent 2019.</font>

34:54.418 --> 34:56.417
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you very much for coming,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">everybody!</font>

34:56.418 --> 34:58.418
<font color="#11FF11">Bye-bye.</font>

35:03.418 --> 35:06.417
<font color="#00FFFF">For some people today, we're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">literally gonna change their lives.</font>

35:06.418 --> 35:07.418
<font color="#00FFFF">So, there will be joy,</font>

35:07.419 --> 35:09.417
<font color="#00FFFF">even though there will be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a lot of tears as well.</font>

35:09.418 --> 35:14.417
<font color="#00FFFF">There are only 40 places on the live</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">semifinals of Britain's Got Talent.</font>

35:14.418 --> 35:16.417
<font color="#00FFFF">So, there's a lot at stake here.</font>

35:16.418 --> 35:17.418
<font color="#FFFF00">And we've made a decision.</font>

35:19.418 --> 35:20.418
<font color="#11FF11">The wait is over.</font>

35:32.418 --> 35:36.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The nation is gripped by this year's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Britain's Got Talent.</font>

35:36.418 --> 35:39.417
<font color="#00FFFF">With the live shows approaching,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everyone wants to know</font>

35:39.418 --> 35:41.937
<font color="#00FFFF">who's going to make it through</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to the semifinals.</font>

35:41.938 --> 35:45.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Literally the entire world</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">watches this show.</font>

35:49.418 --> 35:50.778
<font color="#11FF11">The most dangerous acts.</font>

35:54.418 --> 35:55.418
IN HER OWN LANGUAGE

35:55.419 --> 35:58.417
<font color="#FFFF00">The next guest lit up the stage</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on Britain's Got Talent.</font>

35:58.418 --> 35:59.777
<font color="#00FFFF">Dublin singer Brian Gilligan.</font>

35:59.778 --> 36:01.938
MAN SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE

36:04.258 --> 36:05.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you.</font>

36:05.418 --> 36:07.417
<font color="#FFFF00">We're now seen all over the world.</font>

36:07.418 --> 36:09.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The wait is almost over.</font>

36:09.418 --> 36:11.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Who will the judges</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be sending to the live shows?</font>

36:16.418 --> 36:19.417
<font color="#00FFFF">For some people, today is going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to change their lives.</font>

36:19.418 --> 36:23.938
<font color="#00FFFF">So there will be joy, even though</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there'll be a lot of tears as well.</font>

36:25.418 --> 36:27.778
<font color="#00FFFF">In 13 years, I don't think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it's ever got any easier.</font>

36:29.418 --> 36:30.418
<font color="#11FF11">We've got to make</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the right decision.</font>

36:30.419 --> 36:32.418
<font color="#11FF11">We need to find a great winner.</font>

36:35.418 --> 36:38.777
<font color="#00FFFF">The auditions are over.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The acts have done all they can.</font>

36:38.778 --> 36:41.417
<font color="#00FFFF">The choice of who goes through</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to the live semifinals</font>

36:41.418 --> 36:43.417
<font color="#00FFFF">lies solely in the hands</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of our judges.</font>

36:43.418 --> 36:46.617
<font color="#11FF11">Who will be leaving the London</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Palladium as a live semifinalist</font>

36:46.618 --> 36:49.418
<font color="#11FF11">and who will be going home?</font>

36:51.098 --> 36:53.417
There is no other variety show
on the planet

36:53.418 --> 36:54.617
bigger than the Royal Variety.

36:54.618 --> 36:57.417
I'd have to make sure
I watch my Ps and Qs

36:57.418 --> 37:00.417
for when the Prince
and Meghan Markle are in.

37:00.418 --> 37:04.258
<font color="#FFFF00">If I get through today, I'll love</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you even more and more and more.</font>

37:05.618 --> 37:10.417
This is probably the biggest moment
of my career so far.

37:10.418 --> 37:11.418
<font color="#FFFF00">You're going to be seen by, like,</font>

37:11.419 --> 37:13.417
<font color="#FFFF00">just millions and millions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of people.</font>

37:13.418 --> 37:15.417
Yeah, yeah, it's huge.
Absolutely huge.

37:15.418 --> 37:16.418
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, ready?</font>

37:16.419 --> 37:18.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Ready as we'll ever be.</font>

37:23.418 --> 37:26.417
<font color="#11FF11">Please tell us the name of your act.</font>

37:26.418 --> 37:28.098
The Vardanyan Brothers.

37:29.418 --> 37:31.418
We want to be in the live shows.

37:38.258 --> 37:39.457
<font color="#00FFFF">We've never had anything like this.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">No.</font>

37:39.458 --> 37:43.418
<font color="#00FFFF">This is something that would be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">amazing at the Royal Variety.</font>

37:50.418 --> 37:52.417
I'm a single dad,
so it's really hard to do this

37:52.418 --> 37:55.418
and make my little girl pancakes
in the morning.

37:58.418 --> 38:01.417
<font color="#00FFFF">This is brilliant!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's like a blockbuster movie!</font>

38:01.418 --> 38:03.418
<font color="#11FF11">The stage is yours.</font>

38:07.418 --> 38:09.417
If I got through,

38:09.418 --> 38:12.418
it's just a nice opportunity
to take it to another level.

38:14.418 --> 38:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">We could do this as a living.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It could be life-changing.</font>

38:17.418 --> 38:20.417
<font color="#FFFF00">This has got to be in the show.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">100%.</font>

38:20.418 --> 38:21.418
<font color="#11FF11">Could this act ever win?</font>

38:21.418 --> 38:22.418
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

38:24.098 --> 38:25.417
<font color="#11FF11">Why have you come on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Britain's Got Talent?</font>

38:25.418 --> 38:27.417
Because I want to show you
something special

38:27.418 --> 38:30.417
and try and make the impossible
possible.

38:30.418 --> 38:32.417
<font color="#11FF11">This was seriously spooky.</font>

38:32.418 --> 38:33.418
<font color="#00FFFF">The atmosphere was incredible.</font>

38:33.419 --> 38:36.417
This moment was always meant to be.

38:36.418 --> 38:38.417
SCREAMING

38:38.418 --> 38:40.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Amazing.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, really amazing.</font>

38:40.418 --> 38:44.257
<font color="#11FF11">Can that possibly be your card?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

38:44.258 --> 38:45.457
Growing up watching
Britain's Got Talent,

38:45.458 --> 38:47.417
we've seen so many lives
being changed.

38:47.418 --> 38:49.417
Winning would just be insane.

38:49.418 --> 38:51.417
<font color="#FFFF00">My name's Dave</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm a police officer.</font>

38:51.418 --> 38:53.418
<font color="#FFFF00">I've brought a friend along.</font>

38:54.418 --> 38:56.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd like you to think of an object.</font>

38:56.418 --> 38:59.937
<font color="#FFFF00">You're pretty chilled out,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">compared to me.</font>

38:59.938 --> 39:02.417
<font color="#FFFF00">The word is table.</font>

39:02.418 --> 39:04.417
<font color="#11FF11">He was great.</font>

39:04.418 --> 39:06.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he was very nervous</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on the day.</font>

39:06.418 --> 39:08.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it could be better</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the live shows.</font>

39:08.418 --> 39:10.418
Are you guys nervous, too?

39:12.618 --> 39:14.618
HIS HANDS MAKE A FARTING NOISE

39:20.418 --> 39:22.418
<font color="#11FF11">This was genius.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No.</font>

39:24.418 --> 39:26.417
FARTING NOISES WITH HIS HANDS

39:26.418 --> 39:27.617
<font color="#11FF11">Yes!</font>

39:27.618 --> 39:30.417
FARTING NOISES CONTINUE

39:30.418 --> 39:32.417
<font color="#11FF11">I'm really into it.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think it has a place in the show.</font>

39:32.418 --> 39:34.457
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you, David. I'm with you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You guys are immature.</font>

39:34.458 --> 39:37.417
<font color="#00FFFF">It makes sense that you'd be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">into this. </font><font color="#11FF11">Oh, are we?</font>

39:37.418 --> 39:40.417
I would like to perform
for the royal family.

39:40.418 --> 39:42.457
I do not know
what their reaction would be.

39:42.458 --> 39:44.937
But it would be amazing to perform

39:44.938 --> 39:47.417
in front of a royal family.
FARTING NOISE

39:47.418 --> 39:49.418
<font color="#FFFF00">I beg your pardon.</font>

39:51.618 --> 39:54.417
<font color="#FFFF00">It's so good to see a member of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">royal family sitting next to Simon.</font>

39:54.418 --> 39:56.418
<font color="#FFFF00">It's lovely to see you, Camilla.</font>

39:58.418 --> 40:00.417
AS MICHAEL MCINTYRE:
I can skip! I can skip!

40:00.418 --> 40:04.097
I like to skip. I like to skip.
Yes, skipping is what I like to do.

40:04.098 --> 40:07.417
It's all on my DVD.
It's on my DVD. Yes, it is.

40:07.418 --> 40:09.417
<font color="#FFFF00">It was original</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I knew who the people were.</font>

40:09.418 --> 40:12.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I like you. This is great.</font>

40:12.418 --> 40:14.418
Thank you.

40:15.418 --> 40:18.417
# If I lie here...

40:18.418 --> 40:20.257
I'd love to go through.

40:20.258 --> 40:22.417
I don't want to just go through
to the semifinals,

40:22.418 --> 40:25.257
I want to go the whole way through.
I want it now!

40:25.258 --> 40:27.417
# We could win
Britain's Got Talent...

40:27.418 --> 40:29.937
<font color="#FFFF00">I wasn't expecting that!</font>

40:29.938 --> 40:32.417
<font color="#00FFFF">What's your other hobby, David?</font>

40:32.418 --> 40:34.418
<font color="#11FF11">Striptease.</font>
LAUGHTER

40:36.098 --> 40:37.937
The judges are obviously deciding
today.

40:37.938 --> 40:42.417
If I got through at my age,
at my stage of my career,

40:42.418 --> 40:44.418
it would be just the best news ever.

40:46.418 --> 40:48.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know how many people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we've put through?</font>

40:48.418 --> 40:50.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Go on.</font>

40:51.418 --> 40:52.418
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, no.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">More than ever.</font>

40:52.419 --> 40:54.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Ahem...</font>

40:54.418 --> 40:56.257
<font color="#00FFFF">What?!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, no!</font>

40:56.258 --> 40:58.418
<font color="#FFFF00">And we've got to get from there</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to 40.</font>

41:01.458 --> 41:03.417
Does your cup feel lighter, Amanda?
<font color="#00FFFF">No.</font>

41:03.418 --> 41:05.417
That's a problem.

41:05.418 --> 41:08.097
As an entertainer,
performing at the Royal Variety Show

41:08.098 --> 41:09.417
has got to be the ultimate dream.

41:09.418 --> 41:13.417
<font color="#11FF11">This was funny. And there's more</font>
<font color="#11FF11">mileage in this, right? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Never.</font>

41:13.418 --> 41:16.417
It would be an absolute dream
if we got through to the live shows.

41:16.418 --> 41:17.418
It'd be amazing.

41:17.419 --> 41:19.618
<font color="#FFFF00">What the bloody hell was that?</font>

41:21.418 --> 41:22.418
<font color="#11FF11">Give me that. That's a no.</font>

41:22.419 --> 41:23.778
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What is your problem?</font>

41:29.418 --> 41:31.417
To think Diversity
won so many years ago

41:31.418 --> 41:34.418
and since then there hasn't been
a dance act that's won.

41:35.418 --> 41:37.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Now, we've got</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a few dance acts here.</font>

41:37.418 --> 41:39.417
<font color="#11FF11">This is an easy yes, surely?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, yeah, genius.</font>

41:39.418 --> 41:42.417
# Upside, inside out

41:42.418 --> 41:44.617
# She's livin' la vida loca...

41:44.618 --> 41:51.418
I watch on YouTube in Japan
Susan Boyle sing.

41:53.418 --> 41:57.418
If I get a yes, I'm so happiness.

42:02.098 --> 42:04.418
The competition will be hard.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

42:06.778 --> 42:08.937
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello. What's your name, please?</font>

42:08.938 --> 42:10.938
My name's Faith Tucker.

42:12.418 --> 42:14.418
SHE SINGS AN OPERA ARIA

42:15.418 --> 42:18.097
<font color="#11FF11">I wasn't expecting that,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'll be honest.</font>

42:18.098 --> 42:20.417
To go through to the live shows

42:20.418 --> 42:22.417
would feel like I was in a dream
or something.

42:22.418 --> 42:24.417
And to be eligible to ring my mum
and be like, "I'm through,"

42:24.418 --> 42:26.938
she'd be like, "No, you're not."

42:33.418 --> 42:35.417
<font color="#FFFF00">That was bloody fantastic.</font>

42:35.418 --> 42:37.417
Thank you.
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow!</font>

42:37.418 --> 42:39.418
# Right up in the Isle of Wight

42:40.418 --> 42:43.417
# I hope you're gonna dance...

42:43.418 --> 42:47.417
<font color="#11FF11">This, I'm going to say please,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">please, let's make this a yes.</font>

42:47.418 --> 42:50.777
You know, to be in the semifinals,
I've always dreamt about it.

42:50.778 --> 42:53.778
To be on the biggest stage
in the world, yeah, man!

42:55.418 --> 42:59.417
<font color="#FFFF00"># You are so beautiful...</font>

42:59.418 --> 43:02.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you literally more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">than anything.</font>

43:02.418 --> 43:04.417
<font color="#FFFF00">And I wanted to ask you something.</font>

43:04.418 --> 43:05.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Will you marry me?</font>

43:07.418 --> 43:10.098
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:12.418 --> 43:15.418
<font color="#00FFFF">What about this lovely chap?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">All right, maybe.</font>

43:20.458 --> 43:22.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I always think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you've got a great chance</font>

43:22.418 --> 43:24.417
<font color="#FFFF00">when people want you to do well.</font>

43:24.418 --> 43:27.417
<font color="#FFFF00">And I think every single person in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this theatre wanted you to do well.</font>

43:27.418 --> 43:28.418
<font color="#FFFF00">And you did.</font>

43:28.419 --> 43:30.417
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:30.418 --> 43:32.417
<font color="#00FFFF">What's the big dream for you, Kerr?</font>

43:32.418 --> 43:35.417
To become a recording artist.
That would be the best.

43:35.418 --> 43:38.257
# All we got to do is try

43:38.258 --> 43:41.418
# Try a little tenderness...

43:43.418 --> 43:46.098
<font color="#FFFF00">Four yeses. Congratulations.</font>
Thank you.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, David, you're overruled.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's going through.</font>

43:50.418 --> 43:53.417
# If I die...

43:53.418 --> 43:56.457
My elder brother took sick with a
condition called locked-in syndrome.

43:56.458 --> 43:58.417
He's trapped inside his own body.

43:58.418 --> 44:01.417
And the only thing he can really do
is hear.

44:01.418 --> 44:06.417
# Let him live...

44:06.418 --> 44:09.417
All the stuff that's been on
with my brother not being well,

44:09.418 --> 44:11.617
if this was all to go really well,

44:11.618 --> 44:14.418
it could change their lives
as well as mine.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.417
<font color="#11FF11">We have our 40.</font>

44:17.418 --> 44:20.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Are we absolutely certain on this?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

44:20.418 --> 44:22.417
They always say
you should write songs

44:22.418 --> 44:24.417
about subjects
with which you are familiar.

44:24.418 --> 44:26.417
But I couldn't think of a melody
around cake.

44:26.418 --> 44:28.257
LAUGHTER

44:28.258 --> 44:29.417
I know I joke a lot.

44:29.418 --> 44:32.617
I can't even talk.
It would mean that much to me.

44:32.618 --> 44:35.417
After all this time,
it really would.

44:35.418 --> 44:36.418
<font color="#FFFF00">You kindly just lit up the room.</font>

44:39.418 --> 44:44.417
# Do you ever know
That you're my hero?

44:44.418 --> 44:46.417
There's only that small number
of places

44:46.418 --> 44:48.417
to be given
to all these people here.

44:48.418 --> 44:52.417
I'm not a young man and to think
that they think that much of me

44:52.418 --> 44:56.417
is a tremendous boost to one's ego.

44:56.418 --> 45:01.418
# I could fly higher than an eagle

45:04.418 --> 45:11.417
# You are the wind
Beneath my wings...

45:11.418 --> 45:14.418
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:22.418 --> 45:25.417
<font color="#11FF11">The judges have finally agreed</font>

45:25.418 --> 45:27.417
<font color="#11FF11">who will be going through</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to the live semifinals.</font>

45:27.418 --> 45:30.097
<font color="#00FFFF">The acts are waiting nervously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">backstage</font>

45:30.098 --> 45:33.418
<font color="#00FFFF">and now it's time for them</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to find out their fates.</font>

45:36.418 --> 45:38.417
It's rather like going up a hill
in action,

45:38.418 --> 45:40.418
because you don't know
what's going to happen.

45:42.418 --> 45:43.937
<font color="#FFFF00">Today's the moment of truth</font>

45:43.938 --> 45:46.417
<font color="#FFFF00">and we find out whether</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we're going live on TV</font>

45:46.418 --> 45:47.457
<font color="#FFFF00">in front of ten million people.</font>

45:47.458 --> 45:50.258
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to be the first impressionist</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to win this show.</font>

45:51.098 --> 45:53.417
The competition is so tough,

45:53.418 --> 45:55.418
but I think I did enough
to be in the semifinals.

46:05.418 --> 46:07.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I actually hate doing this bit.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Mm.</font>

46:07.418 --> 46:09.418
<font color="#11FF11">This is the hardest part of it all,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think.</font>

46:19.618 --> 46:21.418
<font color="#FFFF00">How are we feeling?</font>

46:25.418 --> 46:28.417
<font color="#FFFF00">You probably heard backstage</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how many people we put through,</font>

46:28.418 --> 46:29.418
<font color="#FFFF00">which is a lot.</font>

46:31.418 --> 46:34.418
<font color="#FFFF00">So, we have 40 places in the final.</font>

46:37.418 --> 46:39.418
<font color="#FFFF00">And we've made a decision.</font>

46:44.618 --> 46:47.418
<font color="#FFFF00">And the decision was...</font>

46:52.418 --> 46:54.418
<font color="#FFFF00">..you're going through</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to the finals.</font>

47:15.418 --> 47:19.417
<font color="#00FFFF">You understand</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that there are only 40 places</font>

47:19.418 --> 47:22.418
<font color="#00FFFF">on the live semifinals</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of Britain's Got Talent.</font>

47:24.418 --> 47:25.418
<font color="#11FF11">It's all about is this an act</font>

47:25.419 --> 47:27.417
<font color="#11FF11">we think could win</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Britain's Got Talent?</font>

47:27.418 --> 47:30.417
<font color="#11FF11">One that could perform</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at the Royal Variety Performance.</font>

47:30.418 --> 47:32.938
<font color="#11FF11">One that could go on to have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a huge international career.</font>

47:36.418 --> 47:38.418
<font color="#00FFFF">And we have made that decision.</font>

47:44.458 --> 47:48.418
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm delighted to tell you you're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going through to the semifinals!</font>

47:51.418 --> 47:53.418
Woof! Woof!

47:55.418 --> 47:58.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Your story was amazing.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, incredible.</font>

47:58.418 --> 48:00.938
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, we're pleased</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you're through to the next round.</font>

48:02.418 --> 48:05.417
I didn't even think I'd get yeses.
It's, like, ridiculous, isn't it?

48:05.418 --> 48:08.257
I could rule the world.
I think I'm going to be king.

48:08.258 --> 48:12.418
<font color="#11FF11">So, we've been talking and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we've finally come to a decision.</font>

48:14.098 --> 48:15.418
<font color="#11FF11">I'm sorry, it's a no.</font>

48:19.418 --> 48:21.417
<font color="#11FF11">You're all super talented people.</font>

48:21.418 --> 48:24.418
<font color="#11FF11">And I'm sorry we didn't have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">room for you in the live shows.</font>

48:26.418 --> 48:27.458
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, no...</font>

48:28.418 --> 48:31.418
What can I say, you know?

48:32.418 --> 48:34.417
That's how it goes sometimes.

48:34.418 --> 48:36.417
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, Prime Minister!</font>

48:36.418 --> 48:39.417
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's been a Cabinet reshuffle.</font>

48:39.418 --> 48:41.418
I'm a bit fed up
about the lack of confidence.

48:50.418 --> 48:52.938
THEY LAUGH

48:55.618 --> 48:58.258
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't start now.</font>

49:06.418 --> 49:08.778
HE LAUGHS

49:10.418 --> 49:12.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Erm...</font>

49:12.418 --> 49:13.418
<font color="#FFFF00">No... One second.</font>

49:15.418 --> 49:17.098
<font color="#FFFF00">I know who...</font>

49:19.418 --> 49:21.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Amanda, you have to do it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No, I can't.</font>

49:23.418 --> 49:24.458
<font color="#00FFFF">Thank you...</font>

49:26.098 --> 49:27.418
<font color="#00FFFF">..so much for coming today.</font>

49:29.418 --> 49:33.417
<font color="#00FFFF">So, I have to ask you, sir,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't remember you at all.</font>

49:33.418 --> 49:38.417
I have come here today to deliver
a message from the palace.

49:38.418 --> 49:40.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh?</font>

49:40.418 --> 49:45.418
David, Alesha, Camilla and Simon...

49:48.418 --> 49:51.417
..I'd like to thank you
for the invite today

49:51.418 --> 49:53.417
but, frankly, I have
more important things to do

49:53.418 --> 49:54.778
than stand in your presence.

49:56.258 --> 49:58.418
Your Royal Highness the Queen.

49:59.418 --> 50:02.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, I never.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you.</font>

50:04.258 --> 50:05.778
<font color="#FFFF00">We've made a decision.</font>

50:08.618 --> 50:11.418
<font color="#FFFF00">It's four yeses.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You're through to the live shows.</font>

50:12.778 --> 50:14.418
Oh, this is brilliant!
Thank you, love.

50:17.418 --> 50:21.418
AMANDA CACKLES

50:24.458 --> 50:26.418
<font color="#11FF11">Well done, Barbs!</font>

50:44.418 --> 50:45.418
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">How are you all?</font>

50:53.938 --> 50:57.417
<font color="#11FF11">You all did incredibly well</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in the auditions.</font>

50:57.418 --> 51:00.417
<font color="#11FF11">Brilliantly well. All of you.</font>

51:00.418 --> 51:02.418
<font color="#11FF11">But lots of other people did, too.</font>

51:04.418 --> 51:08.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Because Britain's Got Talent</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">obviously now is a global show,</font>

51:08.418 --> 51:11.418
<font color="#00FFFF">we have to keep raising</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">our standards.</font>

51:13.418 --> 51:15.417
<font color="#11FF11">The wait is over.</font>

51:15.418 --> 51:18.418
<font color="#11FF11">We've come to a decision.</font>

51:26.418 --> 51:27.418
<font color="#00FFFF">And that decision...</font>

51:29.418 --> 51:32.418
<font color="#00FFFF">..is, I'm afraid,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that you are going home today.</font>

51:38.418 --> 51:39.458
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

51:41.418 --> 51:43.417
<font color="#00FFFF">But it is literally because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the standard was ridiculous.</font>

51:43.418 --> 51:45.417
Thank you, guys.

51:45.418 --> 51:48.417
<font color="#FFFF00">Distraught, in a way.</font>

51:48.418 --> 51:50.417
<font color="#FFFF00">But it is what it is.</font>

51:50.418 --> 51:52.418
I'll, er... get there another way.

51:53.418 --> 51:56.417
That's me.
I don't give in.

51:56.418 --> 51:59.617
<font color="#FFFF00">This is a huge experience.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We're market traders.</font>

51:59.618 --> 52:02.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Who thought we'd be doing this,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you know?</font>

52:03.618 --> 52:05.418
<font color="#11FF11">I'm so sorry.</font>

52:06.418 --> 52:10.417
<font color="#11FF11">You're going to have to go home</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and work on your acts</font>

52:10.418 --> 52:13.418
<font color="#11FF11">cos you're all through</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to the live semifinals!</font>

52:17.418 --> 52:18.418
Thank you very much.

52:22.418 --> 52:25.418
Absolutely marvellous.
I can't believe it.

52:26.418 --> 52:29.418
And they got a military salute
for it.

52:30.458 --> 52:33.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Our standards raise every year.</font>

52:33.418 --> 52:35.778
<font color="#00FFFF">But we have made our decision.</font>

52:38.458 --> 52:42.418
<font color="#00FFFF">I never want to be the one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to have to tell you this...</font>

52:46.418 --> 52:47.458
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes!</font>

52:53.418 --> 52:56.418
<font color="#00FFFF">You are through to the live shows!</font>

53:12.258 --> 53:13.418
<font color="#00FFFF">You're through to the lives!</font>

53:20.418 --> 53:23.257
<font color="#11FF11">You are all through</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to the live semifinals.</font>

53:23.258 --> 53:24.418
<font color="#11FF11">Well done, guys!</font>

53:38.418 --> 53:40.418
Yes! Yes!

53:45.418 --> 53:46.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

53:48.418 --> 53:50.417
I got to spend doing music
for so long

53:50.418 --> 53:53.417
and, like, my family
have constantly been pushing me

53:53.418 --> 53:56.417
and I just never really thought
that I would get there.

53:56.418 --> 54:01.418
And I feel like this is,
it's not just for me, it's for them.

54:08.418 --> 54:13.418
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm so excited to be at the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">semifinals of Britain's Got Talent.</font>

54:14.618 --> 54:17.418
I'm ready to show those judges
what I've got.

54:20.418 --> 54:21.418
<font color="#11FF11">This is what I think.</font>

54:21.418 --> 54:22.418
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you.</font>

54:25.418 --> 54:27.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely fantastic.</font>

54:27.418 --> 54:30.418
We want to prove
that she made the right decision.

54:34.418 --> 54:36.417
The boss is finally here.

54:36.418 --> 54:38.417
<font color="#FFFF00">That's never happened on any show.</font>

54:38.418 --> 54:41.417
To be on the live semifinals
is incredible.

54:41.418 --> 54:44.417
<font color="#FFFF00">You are going to be my son Eric's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">favourite act.</font>

54:44.418 --> 54:46.418
It's a huge honour.
I dreamt of this my whole life.

54:49.458 --> 54:51.417
<font color="#11FF11">You are a superb talent.</font>

54:51.418 --> 54:53.417
I want it to be better
than my first audition.

54:53.418 --> 54:55.418
Everything's on the line.

54:57.458 --> 54:59.418
<font color="#FFFF00">Bloody fantastic.</font>

55:00.418 --> 55:02.418
This is the biggest thing
in my life.

55:04.418 --> 55:07.417
<font color="#FFFF00">I just want to make my family proud.</font>

55:07.418 --> 55:09.417
I need to take it to the next level.

55:09.418 --> 55:12.417
<font color="#FFFF00">This moment was always meant to be.</font>

55:12.418 --> 55:13.618
SCREAMING

55:15.778 --> 55:17.417
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely thrilling.</font>

55:17.418 --> 55:20.417
I'm still in shock
that we actually made it this far.

55:20.418 --> 55:22.097
<font color="#FFFF00"># Britain's Got Talent...</font>

55:22.098 --> 55:24.417
Does your cup feel lighter, Amanda?
<font color="#00FFFF">No.</font>

55:24.418 --> 55:25.418
That's a problem.

55:25.419 --> 55:28.417
It means so much to me
to be in the semifinals.

55:28.418 --> 55:30.417
That is magic.
It's just huge.

55:30.418 --> 55:33.418
<font color="#FFFF00"># If it wasn't for prosecco</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd probably go mad...</font>

55:36.938 --> 55:38.418
<font color="#FFFF00">You are what the show is all about.</font>

55:39.418 --> 55:40.418
<font color="#11FF11">Stop bothering me!</font>

55:43.418 --> 55:45.418
