00:07.716 --> 00:10.094
There's a strange man
in my bedroom.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.349
No.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.852
- Mum?
- I'm in town.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.899
Look, just go home!
Just go home right now.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.137
Darling, you're breaking up.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.940
- Mum?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.364
Right, then! I'll be off.

00:23.982 --> 00:27.782
Unless... I don't know.
You could come with me.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.451
- Is it always this dangerous?
- Yeah.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.233
How long have I been gone?

01:06.316 --> 01:07.363
About 12 hours.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.245
Oh! Right, I won't be long.
I just want to see my mum.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.288
- What're you gonna tell her?
- I don't know.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.085
I've been to the year
five billion

01:17.160 --> 01:19.254
and only been gone,
what, 12 hours?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.632
No, I'll just tell her
I spent the night at Sharine's.

01:22.708 --> 01:23.834
See you later.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.177
Oh! Don't you disappear.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.003
I'm back! Sharine,
she's all upset again.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.421
Are you in?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.582
So, what's been going on?
How've you been?

02:03.832 --> 02:07.757
What? What's that face for? It's not
the first time I stayed out all night.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.267
It's you.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.269
Course it's me.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.944
Oh, my God, it's you.
Oh, my God.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.538
It's not 12 hours,
it's 12 months.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.751
You've been gone a whole year.
Sorry!

03:21.326 --> 03:24.626
The hours [sat here,
days and weeks and months.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.333
All on my own!
I thought you were dead.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.752
And where were you?
Travelling!

03:29.835 --> 03:32.258
What the hell does that mean,
travelling?

03:32.462 --> 03:33.884
That's no sort of answer!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.425
You ask her, she won't tell me.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.055
That's all she says,
"travelling".

03:38.135 --> 03:40.935
- That's what I was doing.
- Well, your passport's still in the drawer.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.848
It's just one lie
after another!

03:42.931 --> 03:47.027
I meant to phone,
I really did. I just... I forgot.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.608
What, for a year?
You forgot for a year?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.531
And I'm left sitting here?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.199
I just don't believe you!

03:53.316 --> 03:55.785
Why won't you tell me
where you've been?

03:55.986 --> 03:57.078
Actually, it's my fault.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.328
I sort of employed Rose
as my companion.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.501
When you say companion,
is this a sexual relationship?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.204
'No!
'No!

04:05.328 --> 04:06.420
Then what is it?

04:06.496 --> 04:09.500
Because you,
you waltz in here, all charm and smiles,

04:09.708 --> 04:12.678
and the next thing I know,
she vanishes off the face of the Earth!

04:13.044 --> 04:15.718
How old are you, then, 40, 45?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.526
What, did you find her
on the Internet?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.802
Did you go online
and pretend you're a doctor?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.513
- I am a doctor.
- Prove it. Stitch this, mate.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.602
Did you think about me at all?

04:30.437 --> 04:33.065
I did, all the time, but...

04:33.857 --> 04:37.031
One phone call.
Just to know that you were alive.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.328
I'm sorry, I really am.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.376
But do you know what terrifies
me is that you still can't say.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.423
What happened to you, Rose?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.628
What can be so bad
that you can't tell me, sweetheart?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.212
Where were you?

05:05.388 --> 05:07.891
I can't tell her.
I can't even begin.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.318
She's never gonna forgive me.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.813
And I missed a year.
Was it good?

05:12.896 --> 05:15.115
- Middling.
- You're so useless.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.488
Well, if it's this much
trouble, are you gonna stay here now?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.365
I don't know.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.700
Can't do that to her again,
though.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.578
Well, she's not coming with us.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.953
- No chance!
- I don't do families.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.162
She slapped you!

05:29.246 --> 05:32.375
900 years of time and space, and I've never
been slapped by someone's mother.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.504
Your face.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.836
- It hurt!
- You're so gay!

05:37.838 --> 05:39.761
When you say 900 years...

05:40.215 --> 05:41.262
That's my age.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.514
- You're 900 years old.
- Yeah.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.641
- My mum was right.
- That is one hell of an age gap.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.559
Ugh!

05:52.769 --> 05:55.613
Every conversation
with you just goes mental.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.733
There's no one else
I can talk to.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.443
I've seen all that stuff
up there,

05:59.526 --> 06:02.154
the size of it,
and I can't say a word.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.744
Aliens and spaceships
and things,

06:05.824 --> 06:10.125
and I'm the only person
on planet Earth who knows they exist.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.646
Oh, that's just not fair.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.041
All right, all right! Keep your hair on!
It's not my fault, is it?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.914
I can't move anywhere!

07:34.704 --> 07:36.081
Ah, just my luck.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.842
Stay back, please.
Back, thank you.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.885
It's blocked off.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.888
We're miles from the centre.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.844
The city must be gridlocked.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.645
The whole of London
must be closing down.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.940
I know, I can't believe
I'm here to see this. This is fantastic.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.234
- Did you know this was going to happen?
- Nope!

07:56.643 --> 07:58.816
- Do you recognise the ship?
- Nope!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.613
- Do you know why it crashed?
- Nope!

08:00.730 --> 08:01.822
Oh, I'm so glad I got you.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.616
I bet you are.
This is what I travel for, Rose,

08:03.733 --> 08:05.735
to see history happening
right in front of us.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.405
Well, let's go and see it.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.453
Never mind the traffic.
We've got the Tardis.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.620
Hmm, better not.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.368
They've already got
one spaceship in the middle of London.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.579
And I don't wanna shove
another one on top.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.586
Yeah, but yours looks like a big, blue box.
No one's gonna notice.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.258
You'd be surprised,
an emergency like this.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.934
There'll be all kinds
of people watching.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.595
Trust me, the Tardis
stays where it is.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.223
So history's happening,
and we're stuck here?

08:27.298 --> 08:28.515
Yes, we are.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.971
We could do
what everybody else does.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.315
We could watch it on TV.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.616
Big Ben destroyed as a
UFO crash-lands in central London.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.657
Police reinforcements
are drafted in from across the country

08:47.777 --> 08:51.452
to control widespread panic;
looting and civil disturbance.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.626
A state of national emergency
has been declared.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.542
Tom Hitchingson
is at the scene.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.714
The police urge the public
not to panic.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.837
Here's the helpline number
on screen right now,

09:01.916 --> 09:04.715
if you're worried
about friends or family.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.303
The military
are on the lookout for more spaces/ups.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.637
Until then, all flights in North American
airspace have been grounded.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.144
The Army are sending
divers into the wreck of the spaceship.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.817
No one knows
what they're going to find.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.071
The President will address the nation
[I've from the White House,

09:23.146 --> 09:27.151
but the Secretary General
has asked that people watch the skies.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.765
- I've got no choice.
- You've broken your mother's heart.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.446
- Either I make him welcome...
- She's sobbing in my arms.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.998
- ...or I risk never seeing you again.
- I cradled her like a child!

09:34.115 --> 09:35.458
Oi! I'm trying to listen!

09:37.494 --> 09:38.711
News is just coming in.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.165
And we can go to Tom
at the Embankment.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.003
They've found a body.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.801
It's unconfirmed,
but I'm being told

09:44.876 --> 09:47.004
that a body has been found
in the wreckage,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.840
a body
of non-terrestrial origins.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.013
It's being brought ashore.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.645
A body of some sort has been found
inside the wreckage of a spacecraft.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.193
Guess who asked me out?
Billy Croot!

10:03.186 --> 10:07.111
Unconfirmed reports say the body
is of extra-terrestrial origin.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.737
An extraordinary event
unfolding here live in Central London.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.869
The body is being transferred
to a secure unit mortuary.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.950
The whereabouts as yet unknown.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.328
The roads in Central...

10:19.410 --> 10:21.913
And when you stuff your fins on,
you can cover the whole lot

10:22.122 --> 10:24.500
with butter cream.
Oh, look at that!

10:24.707 --> 10:26.926
Then ice it
any colour you want.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.567
And here's one I made
a little bit earlier. Ana' look at that!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.591
Your very own
spaceship, ready to eat.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.395
And for something
a little extra special...

10:34.509 --> 10:36.102
Albion Hospital.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.896
We still don't know
if it's alive or dead'.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.974
Whitehall is denying
everything.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.897
But the body has
been brought here.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.150
Albion Hospital. With the roads closed
off, it's the closest to the river.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.857
Go on.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.988
I'm being told that's General
Asquith now entering the hospital.

11:02.245 --> 11:06.341
The building's evacuated
patients moved out onto the streets.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.178
The police still won't confirm
the presence of an alien body

11:10.253 --> 11:12.130
contained inside those walls.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.238
Let's have a look, then.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.783
Good God!

11:38.114 --> 11:39.616
And that's real?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.210
It's not a hoax
or a dummy, or...

11:42.285 --> 11:43.832
I've x-rayed the skull.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.337
It's wired up
inside like nothing I've ever seen before.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.130
No one could make this up.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.259
We've got experts
being flown in.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.763
Until they arrive,
get that out of sight.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.568
Excuse me, sir.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.236
I know it's a state of emergency and
there's a lot of rumour flying around,

12:15.318 --> 12:17.741
but is it true
what they're saying?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.197
About the Prime Minister?

12:32.043 --> 12:34.341
Mystery still surrounds
the whereabouts of the Prime Minister.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.094
He's not been seen since
the emergency began.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.427
The opposition are critic/sing
his lack of leadership...

12:40.510 --> 12:41.727
Hold on.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.691
Oh, that's Joseph Green,
MP for Hartley Dale.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.688
He's chairman of the
parliamentary commission

12:51.771 --> 12:55.867
on the monitoring of sugar standards
in exported confectionery.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.862
With respect,
hardly the most important person right now.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.415
Indra Ganesh, sir.
Junior secretary with the MOD.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.542
I'll be your liaison.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.834
Where the hell is he?

13:05.910 --> 13:08.333
If we could talk in private,
sir? Follow me upstairs.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.710
Excuse me.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.133
Harriet Jones.
MP for Flydale North.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.505
I'm sorry. Can it wait?

13:13.584 --> 13:15.712
But I did have
an appointment at 3:15.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.924
Yes, and then a spaceship crashed
in the middle of London.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.429
Think the schedule
might've changed.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.989
You've heard
about the alien body, sir?

13:25.054 --> 13:27.056
Never mind that. Where is he?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.478
Where's the Prime Minister?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.731
No one knows, sir.
He's disappeared.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.274
I have to inform you that
with the city gridlocked

13:32.353 --> 13:33.570
and the cabinet stranded
outside London,

13:33.688 --> 13:36.783
that makes you acting Prime
Minister with immediate effect.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.327
Oh, Lord! Oh, hold on.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.160
Pardon me.
It's a nervous stomach.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.456
Anyway-

13:49.412 --> 13:51.835
Margaret Blaine,
she's with MI5.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.416
There's no more
information, sir.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.503
I personally escorted the Prime Minister
from the cabinet room to his car.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.050
This is Oliver Charles,
transport liaison.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.758
The car's disappeared.
There's no record of it, sir.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.434
It literally vanished.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.099
Right. Inside.
Tell me everything.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.272
Er, sir?

14:09.724 --> 14:11.647
The emergency protocols,

14:11.768 --> 14:14.066
detailing the actions to be taken
by the government of Great Britain

14:14.145 --> 14:15.772
in the event
of an alien incursion.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.240
Right. Good!

14:17.315 --> 14:18.567
Blimey!

14:19.400 --> 14:20.526
Pardon me.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.113
Let's work, eh?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.414
And where do you think
you're going?

15:10.493 --> 15:11.540
Nowhere.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.875
It's just a bit human
in there for me.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.508
History just happened, and they're
talking about where they can buy

15:16.582 --> 15:18.334
dodgy top-up cards
for half price.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.177
I'm off on a wander,
that's all.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.013
Right. There's a spaceship
on the Thames, and you're just wandering.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.216
Nothing to do with me.
It's not an invasion.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.177
That was a genuine
crash-landing.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.895
Angle of descent, colour of smoke, everything.
It was perfect.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.015
- So?
- So, maybe this is it!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.398
First contact.

15:33.558 --> 15:37.062
The day mankind officially
comes into contact with an alien race.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.814
I'm not interfering,
'cause you gotta handle this on your own.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.317
That's when the human race
finally grows up.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.533
Just this morning
you were tiny and small and made of clay.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.579
Now you can expand!

15:48.531 --> 15:50.374
You don't need me.
Go and celebrate history.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.997
Spend some time with your mum.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.504
Promise you won't disappear?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.960
Tell you what. Tardis key.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.555
About time you had one.
See you later.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.035
Oi, gorgeous,
come back and join the party!

16:39.123 --> 16:40.340
Oh, my God!

17:10.488 --> 17:11.865
Oi! Doctor!

17:12.615 --> 17:14.208
Doctor!

18:06.752 --> 18:09.175
I bet no one's
brought you a coffee.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.053
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.306
You still can't go in.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.766
Damn, you've seen through
my cunning plan.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.692
Hmm. Look, I'm sorry,
it's just impossible.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.144
Not even for two minutes?

18:24.270 --> 18:26.614
I don't get many chances
to walk these corridors,

18:26.689 --> 18:29.238
I'm hardly one of the Babes,
just a faithful backbencher.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.360
And I know we've had
a brave new world

18:31.444 --> 18:33.913
land right on our doorstep,
and that's wonderful.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.499
I think
that's probably wonderful.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.452
Nevertheless, ordinary life
keeps ticking away.

18:39.535 --> 18:43.039
I need to enter this paper.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.757
Oh! Mr Green, sir.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.470
I know you're busy, but could you put
this on the next cabinet agenda?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.218
- What is it?
- Cottage hospitals.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.099
I've worked out a system

18:53.215 --> 18:57.311
whereby cottage hospitals do not have to be
excluded from Centres of Excellence.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.730
You see, my mother's
in the Flydale Infirmary,

18:59.805 --> 19:02.325
that's my constituency,
tiny little place, you wouldn't know it.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.517
But it's given me
a chance to...

19:03.601 --> 19:07.026
By all the saints,
get some perspective, woman!

19:07.271 --> 19:08.523
I'm busy!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.793
Defence plan Delta!
Come on, move! Move!

22:27.555 --> 22:28.772
It's alive.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.563
Spread out,
tell the perimeter it's a lockdown.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.690
Oh, my God, it's still alive!

22:34.937 --> 22:36.109
Do it!

22:39.525 --> 22:41.744
Mick! Terry! Side rooms! Now!

22:42.862 --> 22:43.988
Clear!

22:45.614 --> 22:46.911
Room clear!

22:46.991 --> 22:48.618
- Keep it moving!
- Clear!

22:51.161 --> 22:53.038
I swear, it was dead.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.046
Coma, shock, hibernation, anything.
What does it look like?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.179
It's still here.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.216
Hello.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.508
Don't shoot!

23:58.604 --> 24:01.448
What did you do that for?
It was scared!

24:05.361 --> 24:06.704
It was scared!

24:15.120 --> 24:16.800
I've got the White House phoning me direct

24:16.872 --> 24:19.000
because Downing Street
won't answer their call!

24:19.208 --> 24:20.334
This is outrageous.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.136
We haven't even started
the vaccination program.

24:23.754 --> 24:24.971
This is appalling.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.096
The nations of the world
are watching the United Kingdom.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.553
Well, it has all been
a bit of a shock.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.645
This is the greatest crisis in
modern history, and you've done nothing.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.646
Your behaviour
has been shameful, sir.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.569
You're supposed to be in charge.
We need positive leadership.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.735
The capital's ground to a halt.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.158
All the more, we can only assume that
the Prime Minister's disappearance

24:45.234 --> 24:47.953
is the direct result
of hostile alien action.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.746
And what've you been doing?
Nothing!

24:49.822 --> 24:51.574
Sorry! Sorry.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.707
Uh, I thought
I was Prime Minister now.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.208
Only by default!

24:57.287 --> 24:59.665
Oh! That's not fair!

25:00.124 --> 25:02.001
I've been having such fun.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.886
You think this is fun?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.338
It's a hoot, this job.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.464
Honestly, it's super!

25:07.965 --> 25:10.809
Oh! Excuse me!

25:10.884 --> 25:14.309
Oh!

25:15.639 --> 25:17.687
- What's going on here?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.394
And where's the rest of the cabinet? Why
haven't they been airlifted in?

25:20.477 --> 25:23.151
I cancelled it.
They'd only get in the way.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.110
Oops! There I go.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.033
- Oh!

25:30.654 --> 25:34.534
I'm shaking my booty.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.459
2

25:36.785 --> 25:38.958
Under section five
of the emergency protocols,

25:39.038 --> 25:42.963
it is my duty
to relieve you of command.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.925
And by God, I'll put this country
under martial law if I have to.

25:47.004 --> 25:50.634
- Oh! I'm scared!

25:51.050 --> 25:54.645
I mean, that's hair-raising.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.307
I mean, literally.

25:58.432 --> 25:59.558
Look!

26:34.009 --> 26:36.808
I just assumed
that's what aliens looked like.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.561
But you're saying
it's an ordinary pig, from Earth.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.020
More like a mermaid.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.777
Victorian showmen
used to draw the crowds

26:43.852 --> 26:45.195
by taking the skull of a cat,

26:45.312 --> 26:48.065
gluing it to a fish
and calling it a mermaid.

26:48.398 --> 26:52.198
Now someone's taken a pig,
opened up its brain, stuck bits on,

26:52.945 --> 26:55.323
then they've strapped it in
that ship, made it dive-bomb.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.373
It must've been terrified.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.416
They've taken this animal
and turned it into a joke.

27:01.537 --> 27:05.542
So it's a fake, a pretend,
like the mermaid.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.711
But the technology
augmenting its brain,

27:08.794 --> 27:10.796
it's like nothing on Earth.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.051
It's alien.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.433
Aliens are faking aliens.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.185
Why would they do that?

27:18.095 --> 27:19.312
Doctor?

27:25.853 --> 27:27.025
Doctor?

27:35.362 --> 27:37.035
Here's to the Martians!

27:37.114 --> 27:38.866
The Martians!

27:45.455 --> 27:47.298
I was gonna come and see you.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.544
Someone owes Mickey an apology.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.675
- I'm sorry.
- Not you.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.639
Well, it's not my fault.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.350
Be fair,
what was I supposed to think?

27:59.761 --> 28:02.184
You disappear,
who do they turn to? Your boyfriend.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.642
Five times I was taken in
for questioning. Five times.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.818
No evidence. Of course!
There couldn't be, could there?

28:06.894 --> 28:09.022
And then I get her,
your mother,

28:09.104 --> 28:10.856
whispering around the estate,
pointing her finger,

28:10.939 --> 28:13.067
stuff through my letter box,
and all 'cause of you!

28:13.150 --> 28:14.993
Didn't think
I'd be gone so long.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.820
And I waited for you, Rose!

28:16.945 --> 28:19.414
Twelve months. Waited for you
and the Doctor to come back!

28:19.573 --> 28:21.450
Hold on!
You knew about the Doctor?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.452
Why didn't you tell me?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.497
Yeah, yeah.
Why not, Rose? Huh?

28:26.997 --> 28:28.419
How could I tell her
where you went?

28:28.498 --> 28:31.092
- Tell me now.
- I might as well, 'cause you're stuck here.

28:31.585 --> 28:32.677
The Doctor's gone!

28:33.003 --> 28:35.802
Just now, that box thing
just faded away.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.096
- What do you mean?
- He's left you!

28:38.467 --> 28:40.094
Some boyfriend
he turned out to be.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.398
He wouldn't just go.
He promised me.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.152
Oh, he's dumped you, Rose!
Sailed off into space.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.608
How does it feel, huh?

28:53.690 --> 28:56.660
Now, you are left behind with
the rest of us Earthlings.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.575
- Get used to it.
- He would've said.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.656
What are you two chimps
going on about?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.500
What's going on?
What's this Doctor done now?

29:03.575 --> 29:05.248
He's vamoosed.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.295
He's not!
'Cause he gave me this.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.169
He's not my boyfriend, Mickey.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.917
He's better than that.
He's much more important.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.092
And he...

29:21.593 --> 29:22.765
What's that sound?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.896
Mum? Mum, go inside!

29:24.972 --> 29:29.478
Mum, don't stand there!
Just go inside, just... Mum! Oh, blimey.

29:36.858 --> 29:37.984
Huh?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.201
How'd you do that, then?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.662
All right, so I lied.
I went and had a look.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.466
But the whole crash landing's a fake.
I thought so. just too perfect.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.296
I mean, hitting Big Ben?
Come on.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.467
So I thought, "Let's go
and have a look..."

29:54.543 --> 29:56.216
- My mum's here.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.841
Oh, that's just what I need.
Don't you dare make this place domestic!

30:00.299 --> 30:03.473
You ruined my life, Doctor.
They thought she was dead.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.032
I was a murder suspect
because of you.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.063
See what I mean? Domestic!

30:07.472 --> 30:08.974
I bet you don't even
remember my name!

30:09.057 --> 30:10.309
- Ricky.
- It's Mickey.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.235
- No, it's Ricky.
- I think I know my own name.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.984
You think you know
your own name? How stupid are you?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.030
Mum, don't! Don't go anywhere!

30:16.106 --> 30:17.483
Don't start a fight.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.411
Mum! It's not like that,
he's not...

30:22.779 --> 30:25.077
I'll... I'll be up
in a minute! Hold on!

30:26.825 --> 30:28.168
That was a real spaceship?

30:28.243 --> 30:30.371
- Yep!
- So it was all a pack of lies.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.582
What is it, then,
that they're invading?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.922
Funny way to invade,
putting the world on red alert.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.920
Good point!
So, what're they up to?

30:42.049 --> 30:43.426
As the crisis continues

30:43.508 --> 30:46.102
and the government
shows a remarkable lack of leadership,

30:46.178 --> 30:48.021
paranoia sweeps the country.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.599
There've been at least three
reports of public assaults

30:50.891 --> 30:53.519
on people possibly
identified as aliens.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.696
Now back to Tom Hitchingson.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.240
Are there more ships to come?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.442
And what is their intention?

31:01.318 --> 31:04.288
The authorities
are now asking, if anyone knows anything,

31:04.738 --> 31:08.618
if any previous sighting has been
made, then call this number.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.835
We need your help.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.973
Yes! I've seen one, I really have, an alien.
And she's with him.

31:27.094 --> 31:31.474
My daughter, she's with him, and she's not
safe. Oh, my God, she's not safe.

31:33.642 --> 31:37.237
I've seen an alien, and I know his name.
He's called the Doctor.

31:37.562 --> 31:42.693
It's a box, a blue box.
She called it a Tardis.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.005
So what you doing down there?

31:59.126 --> 32:00.548
- Ricky.
- Mickey.

32:01.545 --> 32:02.717
Ricky.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.264
If I was to tell you
what I was doing to the controls

32:05.340 --> 32:07.593
of my frankly magnificent
time ship,

32:07.676 --> 32:09.474
would you even
begin to understand?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.814
- I suppose not...
- Well, shut it, then.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.902
- Some friend you've got.
- He's winding you up.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.453
I am sorry.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.326
- Okay.
- I am, though.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.038
Every day, I looked.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.832
On every street corner,
wherever I went,

32:38.915 --> 32:41.384
looking for a blue box
for a whole year.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.838
It's only been
a few days for me.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.345
I don't know.
It's hard to tell inside this thing.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.428
But I swear,
it's just a few days since I left you.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.307
Not enough time
to miss me, then.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.601
I did miss you.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.904
I missed you.

33:07.068 --> 33:10.868
So, um, in 12 months...

33:11.948 --> 33:13.228
Have you been seeing
anyone else?

33:13.241 --> 33:14.367
Nope.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.502
Okay.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.751
Mainly 'cause everyone
thinks I murdered you.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.582
Right.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.180
So, now that you've come back,

33:29.382 --> 33:30.725
are you gonna stay?

33:33.303 --> 33:34.896
Got it! Ha-ha!

33:36.097 --> 33:38.475
Patched in the radar,
looped it back 12 hours,

33:38.558 --> 33:40.686
so it'll follow
the flight of that spaceship. Here we go.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.191
Hold on.

33:42.896 --> 33:43.943
Come on!

33:44.356 --> 33:46.450
That's the spaceship
on its way to Earth.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.151
See?

33:48.276 --> 33:49.903
Except... Hold on.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.747
See? The spaceship
did a slingshot

33:52.822 --> 33:54.199
round the Earth
before it landed.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.831
- What does that mean?
- Means it came from Earth in the first place.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.628
It went up and came back down.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.707
Whoever those aliens are, they haven't just
arrived. They've been here for a while.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.589
Question is,
what've they been doing?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.472
What do you think?
How's the compression?

34:13.592 --> 34:16.391
I think I've got too much
ballast round the middle.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.270
Ooh, that's better!

34:19.349 --> 34:21.949
We've really got to fix
the gas exchange. It's getting ridiculous.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.105
I don't know. Seems
very human to me.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.030
Uh, better get rid of his skin!

34:26.940 --> 34:30.239
Shame,
I quite enjoyed being Oliver.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.996
He had a wife,
a mistress and a young farmer.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.286
God, I was busy.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.672
Back to work!

34:42.746 --> 34:44.293
I have an army to command!

34:44.373 --> 34:47.297
Careful now.
We're not there yet.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.933
General Asquith! Sir,
we've had a priority alarm.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.730
It's Code Nine,
confirmed Code Nine.

35:00.015 --> 35:05.693
Right. Good. Code Nine, huh?
Which would mean?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.987
In the event
of the emergency protocols being activated,

35:10.066 --> 35:11.784
we've got software
which automatically searches

35:11.860 --> 35:13.703
all communications
for keywords.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.371
And one of those words
is "Doctor".

35:15.864 --> 35:17.332
I think we've found him, sir.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.751
What sort of doctor?
Who is he?

35:20.035 --> 35:22.413
Well, evidently, he's some sort of
expert in extraterrestrial affairs.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.290
The ultimate expert!
And we need him, sir.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.421
We need him here right now.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.431
- How many channels you get?
- All the basic packages.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.099
- You get sports channels?
- Yes, I get the football.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.396
Hold on. I know that lot.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.644
But it's looking likely

35:41.723 --> 35:44.567
that the government's
bringing in alien specialists,

35:44.643 --> 35:48.398
those people who've devoted their
lives to studying outer space.

35:49.189 --> 35:52.739
UNIT! United Nations
Intelligence Taskforce. Good people.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.369
How do you know them?

35:54.444 --> 35:56.287
'Cause he's worked for them.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.964
Oh, yeah. Don't think
I sat on my backside for 12 months, Doctor.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.242
I read up on you!

36:00.367 --> 36:02.540
You look deep enough
on the Internet or in the history books,

36:02.619 --> 36:03.745
and there's his name.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.068
Followed by a list of the dead.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.627
That's nice. Good boy, Ricky.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.546
If you know them,
why don't you go and help?

36:08.625 --> 36:11.225
They wouldn't recognise me.
I've changed a lot since the old days.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.176
Besides, the world's
on a knife edge.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.344
There's aliens out there,

36:15.423 --> 36:18.097
and fake aliens
wanna keep this alien out of the mix.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.269
- I'm going undercover.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.685
And, uh, better keep
the Tardis out of sight. Ricky!

36:22.972 --> 36:24.974
You've got a car.
You can do some driving.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.192
Where to?

36:26.267 --> 36:28.908
The roads are clearing.
Let's go and have a look at that spaceship.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.779
Do not move!
Step away from the box!

36:33.858 --> 36:36.611
Raise your hands above your head!

36:51.668 --> 36:52.794
Rose!

36:54.921 --> 36:57.015
Rose! Rose!

37:06.141 --> 37:07.267
Take me to your leader!

37:07.350 --> 37:09.068
My daughter!

37:13.940 --> 37:15.442
This is a bit posh.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.766
If I knew it was gonna be like this, being
arrested, I would've done it years ago.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.951
We're not being arrested,
we're being escorted.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.658
- Where to?
- Where do you think?

37:23.825 --> 37:25.748
Downing Street.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.664
- You're kidding!
- I'm not!

37:28.747 --> 37:31.216
- 10 Downing Street?
- That's the one!

37:31.624 --> 37:34.628
Oh, my God! I'm going
to 10 Downing Street?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.458
- How come?
- I hate to say it, but Mickey was right.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.133
Over the years, I've visited this planet
a lot of times, and I've been, uh,

37:40.383 --> 37:41.555
noticed.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.227
Now they need you.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.144
Like it said on the news, they're
gathering experts in alien knowledge.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.224
And who's
the biggest expert of the lot?

37:49.350 --> 37:51.273
- Patrick Moore?
- Apart from him.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.776
Oh, don't you just love it.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.200
Oh, I'm telling you, Lloyd George, oh,
he used to drink me under the table.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.644
Who's the Prime Minister now?

37:58.693 --> 38:01.116
How should I know?
I missed a year.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.470
Oh, my God!

38:28.389 --> 38:31.063
So she's all right, then?
She's not in any trouble?

38:31.184 --> 38:33.653
All I can say
is that your daughter and her companion

38:33.728 --> 38:35.981
might be in a position
to help the country.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.408
We'll need to know
how she made contact with this man,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.076
if he is a man.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.328
Ooh!

38:43.238 --> 38:44.615
Right, off you go, then.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.413
I need to talk with Mrs Tyler
on my own, thank you.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.472
Harriet Jones,
MP, Flydale North.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.944
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we convene? Quick as we can, please.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.520
It's this way on the right,
and can I remind you

39:15.603 --> 39:18.106
ID cards
are to be worn at all times.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.700
Here's your ID card.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.695
I'm sorry. Your companion
doesn't have clearance.

39:22.735 --> 39:23.827
I don't go anywhere
without her.

39:23.945 --> 39:27.290
You're the Code Nine, not her.
I'm sorry, Doctor.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.158
It's, uh, Doctor, isn't it?

39:29.784 --> 39:31.832
- She'll have to stay outside.
- She's staying with me.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.164
Look, even I don't have
clearance to go in there.

39:34.414 --> 39:35.961
I can't let her in
and that's a fact.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.129
That's all right. You go.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.960
Excuse me. Are you the Doctor?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.338
- Sure?
- Not now. We're busy. Can't you go home?

39:41.421 --> 39:43.173
I just need a word, in private!

39:43.256 --> 39:44.974
You haven't got clearance.
Now leave it!

39:45.049 --> 39:47.302
I'm gonna have to
leave you with security.

39:47.427 --> 39:51.057
It's all right,
I'll look after her. Let me be of some use.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.686
Walk with me.
Just keep walking.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.817
That's right, don't look round.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.196
Harriet Jones.
MP, Flydale North.

40:23.713 --> 40:28.344
This friend of yours,
he's an expert, is that right?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.850
He knows about aliens?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.433
- Why do you wanna to know?

40:42.357 --> 40:44.610
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.786
As you can see
from the summaries in front of you,

40:46.861 --> 40:48.989
the ship had one porcine pilot.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.916
Of course, the really interesting
bit happened three days ago, see?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.834
Filed away
under any other business,

40:53.910 --> 40:56.959
the North Sea satellite
detected a signal,

40:57.038 --> 40:59.757
a little blip of radiation
at 100 fathoms.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.547
Like there's
something down there.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.987
You were just about
to investigate,

41:03.002 --> 41:04.379
and next thing you know,
this happens.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.557
Spaceships. Pigs.
Massive diversion. From what?

41:08.257 --> 41:12.387
They turn the body into a suit, a
disguise for the thing inside!

41:12.470 --> 41:15.144
It's all right, I believe you.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.771
It's... It's alien.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.608
They must have some serious
technology behind this.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.361
If we could find it,

41:23.773 --> 41:25.400
we could use it.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.484
Ooh!

41:27.860 --> 41:29.203
Oh, my God. Is that...

41:29.278 --> 41:31.358
Harriet, for God's sake!
This has gone beyond a joke.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.578
You cannot just wander...

41:34.867 --> 41:36.084
Oh, my God.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.796
That's the Prime Minister.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.876
If aliens fake an alien crash
and an alien pilot, what do they get?

41:46.587 --> 41:47.759
Us.

41:48.589 --> 41:50.011
They get us.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.181
It's not a diversion,
it's a trap.

41:53.761 --> 41:54.933
Oh!

41:57.598 --> 41:59.600
Has someone been naughty?

42:06.107 --> 42:07.859
It was bigger on the inside.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.821
I don't know. What do I know
about spaceships?

42:10.945 --> 42:14.950
That's what worries me.
You see, this man is classified as trouble,

42:15.074 --> 42:18.795
which means
that anyone associated with him is trouble.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.836
And that's my job.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.793
Eliminating trouble.

42:29.881 --> 42:34.227
But that's not possible.
He left this afternoon.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.806
The Prime Minister
left Downing Street. He was driven away!

42:38.473 --> 42:40.692
And who told you that?

42:42.810 --> 42:43.857
Hmm?

42:46.355 --> 42:47.481
Me!

42:51.652 --> 42:53.950
This is all about us.
Alien experts.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.748
The only people
with the knowledge how to find them

42:55.823 --> 42:57.291
gathered together in one room.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.289
Excuse me. Do you mind not
farting while I'm saving the world?

43:03.623 --> 43:06.251
Would you rather
silent but deadly?

43:43.621 --> 43:46.044
Ah!

44:42.930 --> 44:44.807
We are the Slitheen.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.875
Thank you all
for wearing your ID cards.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.961
They'll help
to identify the bodies.

45:35.608 --> 45:38.828
Yesterday saw the start
of a brave new world.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.744
Today might see it end.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.750
Right! You want aliens, you've got
them. They're inside Downing Street.

45:44.825 --> 45:45.826
Come on!

45:52.833 --> 45:54.835
Planet Earth is at war.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.099
Everybody run!

46:03.177 --> 46:05.179
- Who exactly are the Slitheen?
- They're aliens.

46:07.682 --> 46:09.434
I could save the world
but lose you.
