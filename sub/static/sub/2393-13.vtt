Man: I never bet on baseball.

37:44.530 --> 37:49.251
Man #2: I got a guy
in a holding cell back there.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.098
He says you did favors
for gentlemen

37:52.130 --> 37:55.463
who bet extensively on baseball.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.060
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T KNOW?

37:58.100 --> 38:01.638
LESLIE WAS AT MY PLACE
WHEN TWO GOONS BROKE IN --

38:01.680 --> 38:03.568
FITZPATRICKS,
YOU KNOW THEM?

38:03.610 --> 38:04.838
I DO.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.077
WELL, THEY WERE TRYING
TO COLLECT SOME MONEY,

38:08.110 --> 38:12.444
AND LESLIE OVERHEARD SOMETHING
THAT WOULD RUIN ME.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.459
NO ENDORSEMENTS,
NO HALL OF FAME.

38:15.490 --> 38:16.889
SHE SAID IF I EVER LEFT HER,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.855
SHE'D SELL HER STORY
TO A MAGAZINE.

38:19.890 --> 38:22.495
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
BE THAT BAD?

38:23.660 --> 38:26.094
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE TO SAY BUT GOOD NIGHT.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.189
I HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

38:28.230 --> 38:30.494
I GOT IN PRETTY DEEP.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.700
I HAD TO DO SOME THINGS
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.447
TERRENCE, WE CAN DANCE
AROUND THIS ALL NIGHT.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.004
I THREW A GAME.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.410
IT WAS GAME 4 OF THE A.L.C.S.

38:44.450 --> 38:47.749
A 3-RUN HOMER
BAYLOR HIT OFF ME.

38:47.790 --> 38:52.079
70-MILE-PER-HOUR CURVEBALL.
DIDN'T BREAK.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.086
PURE MEAT.

38:56.330 --> 38:59.197
LESLIE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT.

39:00.070 --> 39:03.164
AND THAT PITCH,
IT ERASED MILLIONS IN DEBT.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.531
THAT WAS WHEN
BASEBALL PLAYERS,

39:04.570 --> 39:06.709
THEY DIDN'T MAKE
WHAT THEY MAKE TODAY.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.609
I WAS ALMOST AT THAT GAME.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.349
BUT VERONICA
GETS THE CHICKEN POX.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.947
I WAS GLUED TO THE TV,

39:17.980 --> 39:22.349
WITH MY JERSEY
AND MY FOAM FINGER,

39:22.390 --> 39:24.620
A GROWN MAN.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.423
PRETTY SILLY, HUH?

39:26.460 --> 39:28.849
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
EVEN MORE SILLY?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.698
THE SUPERSTITIOUS FAN
IN ME,

39:31.730 --> 39:35.461
I THOUGHT WE LOST THAT GAME
BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE.

39:37.200 --> 39:42.001
I EVEN FELT A LITTLE GUILTY,
LIKE I LET YOU GUYS DOWN.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.441
THEN I THOUGHT,
THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.711
YOU GUYS
NEVER MADE IT BACK.

39:50.520 --> 39:54.149
I'M $50 AN HOUR
PLUS EXPENSES.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.154
YOU'LL TAKE MY CASE?

40:00.690 --> 40:01.497
WHY?

40:01.530 --> 40:04.021
YOU'RE TERRENCE COOK.

40:04.060 --> 40:07.097
YOU WOULDN'T KILL
A BUS FULL OF KIDS.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.394
I STILL BELIEVE THAT.

40:14.210 --> 40:16.178
[ DOOR CLOSES ]

40:30.720 --> 40:33.450
I'VE GOT A FUNNY STORY
FOR YOU.

40:33.490 --> 40:36.755
I CALL IT
"HOW WEEVIL GOT HIS NEW CAR."

40:36.800 --> 40:41.066
WELL, ARE THERE PICTURES?
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE SLOW.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.636
REMEMBER THAT WHOLE THING

40:42.670 --> 40:45.639
WITH NANCY'S NUMBER
ON THE $50 BILL?

40:45.670 --> 40:48.161
YEAH, I MADE IT UP.

40:49.310 --> 40:51.403
YOU GOT SOME SKILL, GIRL.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.976
THE SHERIFF LET YOUR BUDDY,
THUMPER, GO.

40:53.010 --> 40:56.946
THE BAG OF PILLS YOU PLANTED --
EPHEDRINE.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.483
THERE IS ONE THING
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT,

40:59.520 --> 41:02.011
AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH
DRIVING ME INSANE.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.051
I KNOW YOU BROKE
THUMPER'S LOCK,

41:04.090 --> 41:07.389
JUST TOOK OFF YOUR OWN
AND PUT IT ON THUMPER'S LOCKER.

41:07.430 --> 41:10.319
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DID IT.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.066
WHERE DID YOU HIDE
THE CASH BOX?

41:12.100 --> 41:14.466
THE TWO PLACES
YOU LOOKED FOR IT.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.992
THE CASH BOX
WAS IN MY NIECE'S BACKPACK.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.565
THEN SHE WENT INTO THE BALL PIT,
STASHED THE BOX.

41:20.610 --> 41:22.430
WE GOT THE THIRD DEGREE
FROM YOU,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.175
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS COMING.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.440
THEN SHE WENT BACK IN
AND GOT THE BOX.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.846
WHILE I WAS HAVING
THE BALL PIT DRAINED,

41:28.880 --> 41:31.246
YOU WERE PLANTING CASH
AND EPHEDRINE

41:31.280 --> 41:32.383
IN THUMPER'S LOCKER.

41:32.420 --> 41:34.445
WELL,
I HAD TO GO BACK LATER

41:34.490 --> 41:37.687
AND ADD THE INCRIMINATING
$50 BILL.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.655
SO WHEN YOU RENTED
"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,"

41:40.690 --> 41:42.590
MCQUEEN OR BROSNAN?

41:44.030 --> 41:46.066
IS IT YOUR UNDYING LOVE
FOR ME

41:46.100 --> 41:48.762
OR JUST GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED LUST?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.028
QU?

41:50.070 --> 41:52.561
THAT KEPT YOU
FROM TURNING ME IN?

41:54.710 --> 41:58.134
LOVE. . .OF ROLLER COASTERS.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.876
AND HATRED OF ANYTHING
THAT REQUIRES ME

42:00.910 --> 42:03.174
TO TIE A SWEATER
OVER MY SHOULDERS

42:03.220 --> 42:05.643
AND BE AT SEA
WITH MY CLASSMATES.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.681
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
