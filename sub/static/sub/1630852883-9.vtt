Dream team?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.574
Dream team!

00:32.574 --> 00:33.742
Bryson!

00:33.742 --> 00:35.285
Craig!
What up, cuz?

00:35.285 --> 00:38.830
Both: Dream team! Dream team!
Dream team! Dream team!

00:38.830 --> 00:40.123
Thanks for
keeping the boys

00:40.123 --> 00:41.750
while we're out
looking at colleges.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.586
Are you're sure you can handle
all of this kid energy?

00:44.586 --> 00:45.962
It's no problem.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.048
I love to spend time
with my grandbabies.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.633
They keep me youthful.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.970
Craig, come over here
and give Mama a goodbye kiss.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.388
Both:
Dream team, dream team...

00:55.472 --> 00:57.056
Craig!
Don't you hear Mom calling you?

00:57.140 --> 00:58.391
Dream team,
dream team...

00:58.475 --> 01:00.185
Craig? Craig?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.936
Dream team,
dream team...

01:02.020 --> 01:03.980
Well,
bye to you, too, then.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.440
Both: Dream team,
dream team...

01:05.440 --> 01:07.984
Whoa, where's the fire?

01:07.984 --> 01:09.944
Oof!
Hey, Granddad!

01:10.028 --> 01:11.988
I never could cartwheel,
either.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.281
Bryson,
wait up!

01:13.281 --> 01:15.158
Both:
Couch! Floor!

01:15.158 --> 01:17.327
Now that we know what those are,
where do you wanna sleep?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.912
Let's both
sleep on the floor.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.456
That way, we can lay under
the coffee table like a tent!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.374
Wait,
what coffee table?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.502
That one right there.
Sick.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.670
Earl: Y'all do know
we have beds, right?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.005
Dream team!

01:30.465 --> 01:31.925
Do you see it?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.843
There!

01:33.927 --> 01:36.179
The blast-o-nator!

01:36.179 --> 01:38.056
I put a few
finishing touches on it --

01:38.056 --> 01:39.557
a seatbelt
and a working horn.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.644
Man,
what a horn.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.145
Yup!

01:44.229 --> 01:46.648
But whatever you do,
do not touch that lever.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.943
Remember what happened
the last time?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.194
Ow, wow, yeah.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.654
Dream team!

01:52.654 --> 01:54.864
Yeah!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.991
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:58.535 --> 02:00.078
Ah!
Brake, brake!

02:00.078 --> 02:01.871
Skrrrrr!

02:00.161 --> 02:01.871
Gus!

02:01.955 --> 02:03.414
Ugh! Shoo!
Get outta here!

02:03.498 --> 02:04.874
Earl:
Y'all let him be, now.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.376
I'm cat sitting
for Mr. Johnson

02:06.376 --> 02:08.002
while he gets
his knee replaced.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.587
I thought
you hated Gus.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.047
All that's
in the past.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.924
Eh,
he ain't so bad.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.472
Cuz,
did you see that?
Mm-hmm.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.976
Oh, boys! Do you two wanna head
to the grocery store with me?

02:22.976 --> 02:26.271
I could use some help picking up
a couple things for dinner.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.189
Both: Yeah!

02:26.354 --> 02:28.189
Now hold on now,
sugar.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.233
Are you sure you wanna go
to the grocery store

02:30.233 --> 02:31.568
looking as fine
as you do?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.653
Uh-oh,
she better watch herself!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.113
Jojo:
Watch <i>yourself.</i>

02:35.113 --> 02:36.322
Both: Aww.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.575
But ew.
Yeah, ew.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.536
Dream team!

02:41.536 --> 02:42.787
Grandma, look!

02:42.871 --> 02:45.206
What, do you see
something we need?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.749
I see
something <i>I</i> need.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.627
Both: Corn dogs! Corn dogs!
Corn dogs! Corn dogs!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.129
Y'all need
to calm down.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.965
72 pack --
that's a lot.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.759
Please!

02:56.843 --> 02:58.469
Okay,
I'll buy them.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.138
But you have to
eat them all.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.975
Dream team.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.062
Both:
Movie time!

03:08.146 --> 03:09.647
Craig:
So what's our options?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.983
Same as always --
my dad's birth.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.109
A classic.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.445
Or the only other video
they have.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.573
The only other video they
have!

03:18.573 --> 03:20.575
<i>♪ Check out my jacket!
Check out my pants!</i> ♪

03:20.575 --> 03:21.993
<i>♪ Check out my jacket!
Check it out!</i> ♪

03:23.119 --> 03:25.288
Oh,
this tape never gets old!

03:27.624 --> 03:29.167
Go to bed.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.252
Yes, Grammy.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.629
Dream team.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.380
Now!

03:37.300 --> 03:38.968
Hold up,
check it out.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.179
It's Grandma
and Grandad's room.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.890
Whoa, what do you think'll
happen if we go in there?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.017
We'd probably turn old
or something.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.978
I dare you to go in there
and sit on the bed.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.147
No way!
I'm too young to be old!

03:51.147 --> 03:54.651
I triple...dog...
dare you.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.027
Man...

03:56.027 --> 03:57.487
that escalated quick.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.782
Okay, fine, but you owe me
one of your corndogs.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.703
Great, now lay down,
get under the covers,

04:05.787 --> 04:07.538
and put on
Grandad's dentures.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.123
That wasn't
part of the dare!

04:09.207 --> 04:10.375
I'm getting
out this crypt.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.170
Ah, my back.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.674
Imma comin'.

04:17.674 --> 04:22.470
Oh, Bryson, my boy,
you have gotten so big!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.014
Almost...there...

04:26.391 --> 04:27.642
Okay,
let's go.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.978
Dream team!

04:31.354 --> 04:32.730
Huh?

04:32.814 --> 04:35.108
Hey, Grammy, what are you doing
in Dad's old room?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.860
Your father's left
a bunch of old books in here.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.738
Figured I'd collect some
for my book drive.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.448
Whoa,
what's this?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.659
"The Adventures
of Helium Man?"

04:44.659 --> 04:46.536
"Join the incredible
Helium Man

04:46.536 --> 04:48.579
and his trusted sidekick,
PSI Boy,

04:48.663 --> 04:50.373
as they embark on
a worldly battle

04:50.373 --> 04:52.166
against the diabolical Deflator!"

04:52.250 --> 04:54.085
This is cool.
I never heard of this.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.546
Well, you boys can
keep those if you like.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.881
I'll go ahead
and pack these up.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.638
"Great job,
PSI Boy.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.225
Now that's what I call
staying cool under pressure."

05:09.225 --> 05:10.768
Wow,
what an ending.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.187
That's it?!
There's gotta be more!

05:13.271 --> 05:14.355
Hmm...

05:14.439 --> 05:16.649
How about
we make more?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.067
That's a good plan,
cuz.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.069
You're really good at drawing,
so you should do the art.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.362
I'll write the story.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.031
Yeah,
let's do it!

05:23.031 --> 05:26.034
Okay, I designed the vehicle
that you wrote for page 3.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.077
Oh, dope!
Lemme see what you got.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.245
Check it!

05:29.245 --> 05:30.913
Huh?
So look,
I was thinking,

05:30.997 --> 05:32.498
a balloon-animal dog,
right?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.251
And Helium Man could ride him
like a surfboard.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.086
Nah,
that's too silly.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.588
Well, yeah,
that's the point.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.298
But it doesn't fit
with the gritty nature

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
of our reboot,
though.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.218
We're starting off with
Helium Man's new origin story

05:44.302 --> 05:46.429
where his parents
get popped in an alley!

05:46.429 --> 05:48.681
So try to keep that in mind
for your next design.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.183
Oh...okay.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.270
Also, try coloring inside
the lines a little better.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.481
Hey, I don't tell you
how to write,

05:56.481 --> 05:57.940
so don't tell me
how to color.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.942
Look, man, I'm just saying,
there's lines.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.444
Color inside them.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.321
♪ So you better recognize
and watch your back, son ♪

06:03.321 --> 06:05.740
♪ Don't ever talk about
my art like that, son ♪

06:05.740 --> 06:09.160
♪ Don't ever disrespect
and don't talk smack, son ♪

06:09.160 --> 06:11.079
Earl: Oh, oh,
here comes the mouse!

06:11.079 --> 06:12.955
Going inside the hole!

06:13.039 --> 06:14.665
There he goes!

06:14.749 --> 06:16.834
I said,
there he goes...

06:16.918 --> 06:18.461
Gramma, Grandpa,
check it out!

06:18.461 --> 06:21.130
It's "The Adventures of
Helium Man: The Beginning."

06:21.214 --> 06:22.548
Uh, what's this,
now?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.967
So, it's like Helium Man,
but more of an origin story.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.427
I wrote the whole thing
by myself.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.929
Jojo:
Oh, that's nice.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.680
Are these
Craig's drawings?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.391
Oh, oh, yeah,
Craig's helpin' too!

06:32.475 --> 06:34.060
How lovely!

06:34.060 --> 06:36.062
Just make sure
you watch your spelling.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.815
Looks like you spelled "popped"
with an extra "o"

06:38.815 --> 06:40.775
instead of
an extra "p."

06:40.775 --> 06:42.318
Pooped!

06:42.318 --> 06:44.779
Shh!
Not in front of Gus.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.376
What are you
doing up so early?

06:58.376 --> 07:01.295
Oh, I was changing the story
to get rid of PSI Boy

07:01.379 --> 07:03.631
so Helium Man can be
more of a brooding loner.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.174
Get rid
of PSI Boy?!

07:05.258 --> 07:07.385
But how would you
even do that?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.512
Popped?
In an alley.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.888
Duh.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.888
What?!

07:10.972 --> 07:13.975
PSI Boy is the coolest sidekick
in the Ballooniverse!

07:13.975 --> 07:16.060
You can't just pop him
in an alley!

07:16.144 --> 07:18.104
Helium Man is a vigilante
by nature

07:18.104 --> 07:20.356
because he rises
above everyone else!

07:20.356 --> 07:21.691
It's a simple case
of physics.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.609
He doesn't need
PSI Boy anymore.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.028
You're gonna have to redraw
the entire comic, by the way.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.196
Okay. Fine.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.447
I'll draw
whatever you want,

07:28.531 --> 07:29.949
but you're
gonna have to pay up.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.200
Huh?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.535
Here's my contract.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.787
Sign on the dotted line.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.787
Lemme see that!

07:34.871 --> 07:37.540
"Everything in the comic
is owned by Craig?!"

07:37.540 --> 07:39.375
I'm not agreeing
to that!

07:39.375 --> 07:42.253
Well, at least you could agree
to brush your teeth!

07:45.173 --> 07:47.049
You know what?
I don't have to take this.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.551
I'm outta here.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.220
Ooh, it's kinda bad.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.475
You're watching
that thing again?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.478
If you've got a better
suggestion, I'm all ears.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.397
Nah, I'm gonna
work on the comic.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.149
But if you don't want to help,
that's cool.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.068
It's not like the illustrations
were all that great anyway.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.616
Hey...

08:11.616 --> 08:13.159
can I see?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.786
See with your eyes,
not your hands.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.788
Aaaaaagh!

08:19.999 --> 08:22.251
Oh,
what on Earth?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.253
Hey, hey, hey,
break it up, you two!

08:24.337 --> 08:25.504
Yeah!

08:25.588 --> 08:27.506
Y'all went ahead
and woke up my Gussy-Poo!

08:27.590 --> 08:29.383
He tried to make me sign
a contract!

08:29.467 --> 08:30.885
He called
my drawings ugly!

08:30.885 --> 08:32.094
I never said that!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.971
Yeah,
but you <i>thunk</i> it!

08:34.055 --> 08:35.348
Enough!

08:35.348 --> 08:37.099
You two have been acting like
a couple goblins

08:37.183 --> 08:38.601
this entire episode.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.770
Off to bed.
Both of you!

08:40.770 --> 08:44.315
But --

08:40.853 --> 08:44.315
Bed. Now.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.524
Whoo!

08:45.608 --> 08:48.027
Mm, Grandma Jojo,
more like Grandma No-No.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.113
Isn't that right,
Gus-Gus?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.617
Why?!

08:54.617 --> 08:56.744
Jojo:
Earl, I'm fixing to go!

08:56.744 --> 08:58.496
Earl:
Just a sec.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.872
Craig, Bryson?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.666
Can I count on you boys
to keep an eye on Gus

09:01.666 --> 09:03.167
while we're at
the book drive?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.835
I don't want to ruin my chances
of cat-sitting

09:04.919 --> 09:06.212
for Mr. Johnson again,

09:06.212 --> 09:09.298
so please take care
of my little snow cone.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.300
'Kay.
Fine.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.679
Bruh, you're not done
with that hose yet?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.305
You've had it
all afternoon.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.349
If those sweet potatoes
get any more water,

09:18.349 --> 09:21.686
they're gonna be
sweet mashed potatoes.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.895
Hey, Bryson?

09:22.979 --> 09:25.398
Why don't you take it,
then?!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.066
Huh?

09:31.821 --> 09:32.905
Nice try.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.323
Why'd you have to dodge,
you dummy?!

09:34.407 --> 09:37.493
You made me hit Gus,
and now he's on the roof!

09:37.493 --> 09:39.036
Oh,
so it's <i>my</i> fault?!

09:39.120 --> 09:40.663
You got him stuck on the roof!
Get outta here, bro!

09:40.663 --> 09:42.623
This is because you insulted
my art! I'm sick of you --

09:42.707 --> 09:44.500
Hey! If you don't get me
down from here,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.669
I'll tell on you both!

09:46.669 --> 09:50.506
And then I'll put your grandad
in the hospital,

09:50.506 --> 09:53.759
just like I did
Old Man Johnson.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.807
Yo,
that cat is scary,

09:59.807 --> 10:01.517
but we have to
get him down.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.019
I know.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.355
If only there were a way to just
blast up there and grab him.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.024
I have an idea.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.196
Get him, cuz!

10:15.406 --> 10:18.200
Aaaahhhhhh!

10:19.702 --> 10:20.995
Craig!

10:20.995 --> 10:23.164
You did it!

10:23.164 --> 10:25.124
Nah, man.
<i>We</i> did it.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.294
Hey, I'm sorry for the stuff
I said about your drawings.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.087
I'm sorry for saying
your breath stunk

10:30.171 --> 10:32.548
and for trying
to rip your script.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.592
Are we still
the dream team?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.302
You know it.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.848
And right before Helium Man
is about to get popped,

10:40.848 --> 10:43.851
PSI Boy would come in
riding the balloon dog.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.394
Awesome!

10:45.478 --> 10:47.855
Y'know, it's been really nice
having you boys over all week,

10:47.855 --> 10:50.232
and I'm happy to see
you're back in good spirits.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.027
And just in time
for your favorite meal --

10:53.027 --> 10:56.030
good ol'
corn dogs.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.824
Grammy, can we --

10:58.908 --> 11:02.536
Finish them corn dogs.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.750
♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪

11:07.750 --> 11:12.254
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.338 --> 11:15.716
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:15.800 --> 11:16.926
♪ At the creek ♪

11:16.926 --> 11:19.387
Just like I drew it.
