00:29.700 --> 00:32.851
Every birth begins as a mystery,

00:33.387 --> 00:37.227
an enterprise whose outcome
cannot be foretold.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.677
We think, "May all be well."

00:42.275 --> 00:46.155
And all is well - almost always.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.200
Your councillor is
Mrs Violet Buckle!

00:52.723 --> 00:55.723
But joy is only
the beginning of the journey.

00:57.811 --> 01:02.131
And we must move forward,
fuelled by faith.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.696
More flowers?

01:13.751 --> 01:16.951
The Rotary Club and the
Local Trader's Association.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.324
No, I've no vases left.

01:19.419 --> 01:20.819
We'll have to put them in buckets.

01:20.844 --> 01:22.034
PHONE RINGS

01:22.324 --> 01:23.684
You not going to get that?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.829
It's not stopped all morning.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.337
Councillor Violet Buckle speaking.

01:29.362 --> 01:31.550
May I ask what your call
is regarding?

01:31.753 --> 01:35.655
- Mum!
- Oh, Reggie, love, is that you?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.279
Congratulations, Mum.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.443
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:38.468 --> 01:40.068
Are you in charge now?

01:40.920 --> 01:44.439
Not quite, no, but,
as council member for Poplar North,

01:44.440 --> 01:47.488
I shall do my very best to improve
our local community.

01:47.513 --> 01:49.035
You're going to be busy?

01:49.060 --> 01:50.100
I suppose so.

01:50.164 --> 01:51.924
Never too busy for you, Reggie.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.508
Now, don't beat about the bush -

02:04.680 --> 02:07.143
make it clear that
it's a very important trial

02:07.168 --> 02:09.977
and that we're asking the mothers of
all eligible babies to take part.

02:10.002 --> 02:10.930
Righty ho.

02:10.955 --> 02:12.306
And tell them that
Mrs Turner's giving

02:12.330 --> 02:13.620
a short talk at the
end of clinic.

02:13.644 --> 02:14.684
Will do.

02:14.934 --> 02:15.974
Well, off you pop.

02:19.642 --> 02:21.242
And don't take no for an answer.

02:23.818 --> 02:26.178
Right, ladies. Measles!

02:26.203 --> 02:28.123
- Just take a seat.
- Thank you.

02:29.335 --> 02:30.375
Good afternoon.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.970
Dr Turner referred me
for my post-natal check.

02:33.348 --> 02:35.308
- Hazel Becker.
- Ah, yes.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.155
We don't seem to have
your records yet.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.707
We just moved from Stepney.

02:38.732 --> 02:41.307
And before that, you were in
Cyprus, is that right?

02:41.332 --> 02:43.663
My husband was posted there
for two years.

02:44.447 --> 02:47.167
You'll be used to this
warm weather, then?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.988
If you'd just like to join
the queue for weighing.

02:50.013 --> 02:52.234
And just so you know,
Sister Hilda now

02:52.259 --> 02:54.757
runs a playgroup here
on Thursday mornings.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.439
You'll find it an excellent way
to meet other mothers.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.288
Right. I'll bear that in mind.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.353
Thank you.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.619
Can I interest you in
a measles vaccination leaflet?

03:06.644 --> 03:09.002
Our clinic's part of a
nationwide trial aiming

03:09.027 --> 03:11.059
to eradicate this
very serious disease.

03:11.084 --> 03:13.484
This says measles can kill.
I didn't know that.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.543
You see children out
on the street with it,

03:15.568 --> 03:17.279
covered in a rash,
spreading it around!

03:17.280 --> 03:18.839
It's a very underestimated disease.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.799
It can cause all sorts of
horrible complications -

03:21.800 --> 03:24.129
blindness, heart problems,
brain damage.

03:24.154 --> 03:26.145
- And death?
- Absolutely.

03:26.466 --> 03:28.027
So would you like to stay
for the talk?

03:28.277 --> 03:29.397
I suppose I'd better.

03:45.837 --> 03:48.676
I'm sorry, Nurse, I couldn't
hear you above the racket.

03:48.701 --> 03:50.220
Not to worry. How are you, Betty?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.742
Well, look at me - I'm blooming.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.806
Come in, come in.

03:53.831 --> 03:56.191
It's mine! Give it back!

03:58.120 --> 04:00.402
Well, this is rather disappointing.

04:00.427 --> 04:03.786
I'm so sorry, Mrs Turner.
I spoke to lots of mothers,

04:03.811 --> 04:06.911
just like Nurse Franklin said,
but maybe I scared them off.

04:06.936 --> 04:09.135
If we can't drum up
a lot more interest,

04:09.307 --> 04:11.176
we shall have to abandon the trial.

04:11.216 --> 04:12.231
Not to worry.

04:12.256 --> 04:14.535
We shall simply have to
alter our approach.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.425
What do you have in mind?

04:16.562 --> 04:19.120
Well, as the stick
clearly hasn't done the trick,

04:19.146 --> 04:21.060
we'll have to dangle
a carrot or two.

04:21.413 --> 04:24.642
I'm sure Sister Frances and I can
come up with something suitable.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.067
If you're quite sure...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.967
I'm sorry,
but will the talk be starting soon?

04:29.992 --> 04:31.988
I'm afraid we've had to postpone.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.731
But a new date will be announced
very shortly.

04:38.607 --> 04:42.046
Excuse the smell - we was making
jam tarts and the jam caught.

04:42.071 --> 04:43.231
It's mine! Bang, bang!

04:45.480 --> 04:47.855
Yeah, I know the boys
should be at school.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.465
But we was having fun.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.682
Besides, I like 'em here with me.

04:52.707 --> 04:55.146
You'll have the inspector after you,
if you're not careful.

04:55.201 --> 04:56.720
Ooh, let him try!

04:56.745 --> 04:59.624
Well, your blood pressure
looks very satisfactory.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.839
It's like I said to Dr Turner -
I could do this in me sleep.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.599
Do you know, he wanted me
up at the hospital for this one?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.119
Once you get to number six,
we like to be careful.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.637
But you'll have two
of us keeping an eye

05:09.661 --> 05:11.226
on you, so you've
nothing to worry about.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.689
Is your, er, Donny still away?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.217
He's on one of them
new container ships.

05:16.354 --> 05:18.163
You know, somewhere
near Newfoundland.

05:18.314 --> 05:19.565
And have you found
someone to sit with

05:19.589 --> 05:20.718
the others when the
big day comes?

05:20.742 --> 05:21.624
Oh, yeah.

05:21.649 --> 05:23.940
Old Mrs Girton from upstairs
is going to help.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.696
See you later, Mum.
I'm going up west with Petey.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.272
- In another new shirt?
- Got to look my best.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.319
First things first,

05:33.320 --> 05:37.639
we need to list all the babies who
fall within the correct age range.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.917
There's going to be quite a few.
The more the merrier.

05:39.942 --> 05:42.733
Then we just need to think of a
suitable incentive for the mothers.

05:42.758 --> 05:45.022
Perhaps a free gift of some sort.

05:45.169 --> 05:46.532
Isn't that bribery?

05:46.557 --> 05:49.852
Not when it's in the interest
of public health.

05:49.877 --> 05:50.917
Nurse Franklin?

05:53.323 --> 05:54.722
What is the meaning of this?

05:54.747 --> 05:56.586
We're just retrieving
some patient files,

05:56.720 --> 05:57.961
Miss Higgins, we won't be long.

05:57.986 --> 06:00.225
And may I ask, who gave
you permission?

06:00.404 --> 06:03.963
It's for Dr Turner's measles trial.
If you have any objections,

06:03.988 --> 06:05.548
do feel free to take it up with him.

06:38.514 --> 06:40.473
Are you on board?

06:40.498 --> 06:41.538
- Yeah.
- Lovely!

06:43.052 --> 06:44.811
You could display one
in your window.

06:44.836 --> 06:46.116
Preferably at eye level.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.680
This looks good!

07:02.508 --> 07:03.545
Enter.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.133
30!

07:05.158 --> 07:07.665
Over 30 mothers have
agreed to attend?

07:07.690 --> 07:11.169
They have, and we were able to hire
the hall at the institute as

07:11.280 --> 07:14.025
the toddler tap class is
currently on hiatus.

07:14.097 --> 07:16.736
Nurse Franklin thought you might
like to give the talk yourself,

07:16.761 --> 07:19.408
Dr Turner,
seeing as we've such a big turnout.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.597
I'd be happy to.

07:20.622 --> 07:23.061
This really is excellent work,
Sister Frances.

07:23.086 --> 07:27.717
We also noticed that Teddy's the
right age for the trial, Mrs Turner.

07:27.836 --> 07:29.875
Yes, that's correct.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.139
So Nurse Franklin wondered if
you might like to have him

07:32.164 --> 07:33.803
vaccinated as part of the talk

07:34.065 --> 07:36.838
to show the mothers that there's
nothing to be worried about?

07:37.099 --> 07:40.058
Well, yes, I suppose we could.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.878
Because, if you don't mind sticking
a big needle in your son's arm,

07:42.903 --> 07:44.202
why should they?

07:44.860 --> 07:45.900
Quite.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.152
Thank you for notifying us,
Mrs Girton.

07:50.177 --> 07:52.742
Morning. Not bad news, I hope?

07:53.484 --> 07:55.323
Oh, no, not at all.

07:55.723 --> 07:58.658
My mother writes to inform me that
my cousin is getting married

07:58.683 --> 08:00.416
to a young man she met
at the church picnic.

08:00.441 --> 08:02.720
Oh! That's nice for her.

08:02.914 --> 08:04.793
My mother also wonders if
there are any

08:04.818 --> 08:07.772
"clean, well-mannered gentlemen"
attending my own church.

08:07.797 --> 08:08.836
Nurse Dyer?

08:08.861 --> 08:10.797
Betty Marwick's neighbour
has just called

08:10.822 --> 08:12.780
to inform us that her
waters have broken.

08:12.805 --> 08:13.736
On my way.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.640
Nurse Anderson, if you can assist?

08:16.665 --> 08:17.702
Of course.

08:18.010 --> 08:20.329
You'll have rather a full house
to contend with.

08:20.354 --> 08:23.914
As I remember, Betty's children
can be quite lively.

08:26.357 --> 08:27.388
There you go, sweetheart.

08:27.413 --> 08:30.692
Now, you're going to be good as
gold for Mrs Girton, aren't you?

08:30.874 --> 08:33.873
Oh, Sharon, come here,
sort your plaits out!

08:33.898 --> 08:35.538
Betty, I really need
to get you into

08:35.563 --> 08:37.134
the bedroom,
so I can examine you.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.679
Here, wait a minute, Nurse - I just
need to find the blessed hairbrush!

08:43.491 --> 08:45.370
I've still not found
any clean bed linen.

08:45.395 --> 08:46.834
That's quite enough, thank you.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.898
Out you go.

08:47.923 --> 08:50.163
You're going to have to
dismantle that tipi.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.938
May I take this
opportunity to offer my

08:54.963 --> 08:57.639
congratulations in person,
Councillor Buckle?

08:57.640 --> 08:59.629
You're very kind, Nurse Crane.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.842
But, of course,
now the hard work really begins.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.202
Indeed.

09:04.227 --> 09:05.666
I'm afraid I, myself,

09:05.691 --> 09:08.827
am contemplating a curtailment
of my additional duties.

09:08.852 --> 09:12.358
Running Cubs alone has proven
somewhat onerous of late.

09:12.383 --> 09:14.942
I hope you won't be
abandoning them entirely?

09:14.967 --> 09:16.286
Not entirely.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.402
But the District Commissioner
has given me

09:18.427 --> 09:21.635
leave to advertise
for assistance.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.219
I'm glad to hear it.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.800
Now, delegation - that's the key.

09:26.987 --> 09:29.306
It is so terribly easy to forget

09:29.331 --> 09:32.837
the damage that can be caused by
the measles infection.

09:33.459 --> 09:37.292
But I have seen children
left with brain damage

09:37.317 --> 09:39.008
or permanent hearing loss.

09:39.956 --> 09:44.595
This common childhood illness
can have very serious consequences.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.457
You mean they can die?

09:46.482 --> 09:50.633
Sadly, yes,
in some cases, it can be fatal.

09:50.746 --> 09:56.065
But if this trial proves successful,
we shall have a vaccine,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.960
which will effectively protect
all our children.

10:00.076 --> 10:01.635
Speaking of which,

10:01.660 --> 10:06.517
if I can introduce our first
volunteer - my own son, Teddy.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.483
Hello, you!

10:18.508 --> 10:19.627
Hello.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.159
It's Dawn Alison Becker.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.408
October the 3rd, 1963.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.026
Oh!

10:25.343 --> 10:27.917
Sorry, I'm just doing
my mental arithmetic.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.119
I'm afraid Dawn's too young
to take part, Mrs Becker.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.879
It's only for babies
over ten months.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.439
That's nit-picking! Splitting hairs!

10:36.440 --> 10:37.719
I'm sorry.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.799
But we have to do as
the guidelines tell us.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.599
And in the meantime, what are you
telling these babies' mothers?

10:42.600 --> 10:46.399
That measles can blind them,
maim them, even kill them?

10:46.400 --> 10:49.119
But if you're under ten months, you
just have to take your chances?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.839
Mrs Becker, is something amiss?

10:50.840 --> 10:52.919
Do you want to tell her, or shall I?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.711
She's saying that my Dawn
can't have her vaccination.

10:55.736 --> 10:57.508
She's only eight months old.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.692
Then Sister is correct.

10:59.717 --> 11:02.436
But if all goes well with the trial,
it may well be that we can

11:02.480 --> 11:04.719
vaccinate your little girl too
in a year or two.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.760
A year or two?

11:06.806 --> 11:08.753
I'm sorry for wasting your time!

11:11.125 --> 11:14.004
Oh, dear. She was very angry.

11:14.029 --> 11:16.549
No. She was very upset.

11:18.539 --> 11:22.819
SHE GROANS

11:24.869 --> 11:27.668
All right, precious,
we're nearly there.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.243
Just little pushes.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.520
Little pushes for the head,
nice and steady.

11:34.413 --> 11:36.493
But this baby has other ideas!

11:39.506 --> 11:42.025
You couldn't wait, could you,
sweetheart?

11:42.050 --> 11:44.889
You couldn't wait to come out
and meet your family!

11:44.914 --> 11:47.994
BABY CRIES

11:53.986 --> 11:57.466
Boy or girl? Nurse?

11:59.689 --> 12:00.729
It's a boy.

12:07.485 --> 12:13.044
Kirk - we're calling him Kirk,
like Kirk Douglas!

12:13.920 --> 12:15.080
Is that right?

12:17.290 --> 12:19.469
You just lie down now.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.760
Catch your breath for a moment.

12:23.582 --> 12:26.381
I loved him in that one
where he was a Viking.

12:26.406 --> 12:30.208
Do you know the one I mean?
Oh, he was that handsome!

12:32.040 --> 12:34.376
Well, let's have
a look at him, then.

12:38.790 --> 12:39.830
Nurse?

12:48.618 --> 12:51.436
Betty, now, I don't
want you to be alarmed.

12:51.461 --> 12:53.767
Well, you're alarming me,
just saying that!

12:54.707 --> 12:57.108
You're alarming me
by just looking so kind.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.972
Kirk is fit and well, Betty,

12:58.997 --> 13:00.796
and he's got a prize-winning
pair of lungs!

13:00.821 --> 13:02.360
You heard him just now.

13:02.636 --> 13:06.115
But his top lip and - we think -
the roof of his mouth didn't

13:06.140 --> 13:08.177
develop properly in the womb.

13:09.028 --> 13:11.480
So he doesn't look quite like
your others would've done.

13:15.207 --> 13:17.087
Is that why
you're covering his face?

13:18.599 --> 13:20.566
We didn't want you get a shock.

13:21.046 --> 13:23.526
But you can see for yourself,
when you feel ready.

13:42.186 --> 13:43.586
Have you uncovered him yet?

13:52.594 --> 13:54.121
Oh, my God!

13:54.633 --> 13:56.668
We will need the doctor
to take a look at him.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.479
We're going to call
the maternity home

13:59.480 --> 14:01.412
and say we're sending you both over.

14:01.437 --> 14:02.944
Poor little lad.

14:14.163 --> 14:15.917
Can't believe that nurse
turned us away.

14:16.378 --> 14:18.040
But if Dawn's too young...
That's not the point.

14:18.064 --> 14:19.921
You didn't hear
what they were saying.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.302
The horrible things that could
happen if she caught it.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.606
They said Dawn could die.

14:23.631 --> 14:26.502
She's not going to die.
Nothing's going to happen to her.

14:26.527 --> 14:28.320
You've got to stop
thinking like that.

14:30.472 --> 14:32.471
You could try putting her in a cot.

14:32.731 --> 14:35.000
She's getting a bit big
for that thing. She's fine.

14:35.025 --> 14:37.504
And can you remember to leave
your boots outside of the flat?

14:37.529 --> 14:39.195
She's crawling now,
so I don't want you

14:39.220 --> 14:40.837
walking in all the
dirt from the factory.

14:40.862 --> 14:43.011
I can hardly leave 'em in the
corridor. Someone'll pinch 'em.

14:43.035 --> 14:46.343
Put them on the balcony, then!
Is that really too much to ask?

14:47.001 --> 14:53.930
S... O... S.

14:55.692 --> 14:59.615
Well done! Right, Pack.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.349
We shall return to the art of
semaphore at a later date,

15:02.374 --> 15:03.693
but for now if you would please

15:03.718 --> 15:05.998
return your flags to
the receptacle on this table.

15:08.692 --> 15:13.855
Now, a reminder for your mothers -
there will be no meeting

15:13.880 --> 15:19.202
on the 18th because, as you may
know, it's the Whitsun Bank Holiday.

15:19.227 --> 15:21.146
My Auntie Lorna's going to Southend.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.119
She says they have ice creams
and real live donkeys.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.399
So I understand.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.440
She said she'd take me next year,
but Mum says she's all talk.

15:32.084 --> 15:33.403
All right, young man.

15:33.428 --> 15:34.627
All done.

15:34.652 --> 15:36.410
So how big is it?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.309
This gap in the roof of his mouth?

15:39.113 --> 15:40.432
It's sizeable.

15:40.589 --> 15:44.068
In a day or two, the surgeon at St
Cuthbert's will have a look at him

15:44.093 --> 15:45.832
and start to plan the operation.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.467
So, once he's had that,
will he be all right?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.461
We can repair his lip straight away.

15:51.892 --> 15:55.377
But the surgery inside the mouth
won't be for some months.

15:56.145 --> 15:57.975
One step at a time.

15:59.003 --> 16:00.727
I'll leave you with these ladies.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.831
I think the young man's
feeling peckish.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.726
BABY CRIES

16:04.751 --> 16:06.710
Is he in pain?
Is that why he's crying?

16:06.735 --> 16:08.014
No, not at all.

16:08.039 --> 16:09.977
It's like Doctor said,
he's just hungry.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.881
Luckily, we have some bottles
with long teats the little chap

16:12.906 --> 16:14.757
will be able to drink out of
quite happily.

16:14.782 --> 16:16.381
We'll set you up with the pump.

16:16.406 --> 16:18.846
Pump? What do you mean, pump?

16:21.519 --> 16:23.998
- Nurse Crane!
- Good Lord!

16:24.084 --> 16:27.883
It would behove you to wear
a heavier shoe or at the very least

16:27.908 --> 16:30.387
to announce your presence
in a more timely fashion!

16:30.560 --> 16:34.280
My apologies but, er, I have come
to offer my services.

16:35.134 --> 16:36.533
In what capacity?

16:36.558 --> 16:38.973
For the position of
Assistant Cubmaster,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.617
as per your advertisement.

16:41.039 --> 16:44.998
I have extensive experience within
the scouting community

16:45.023 --> 16:49.100
and can provide references from
the Akela at my former pack

16:49.125 --> 16:50.960
in Stepney, should you require them.

16:51.900 --> 16:57.419
Well, providing the
District Commissioner is agreeable,

16:57.444 --> 17:01.524
I suppose we can consider the
implementation of a trial period.

17:04.045 --> 17:05.805
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

17:08.310 --> 17:09.910
I'd seen it in training, but

17:10.200 --> 17:12.960
I'd never delivered a baby
with a cleft palate before.

17:12.984 --> 17:14.741
It did come as quite a shock.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.390
The condition can be
extremely disfiguring,

17:17.415 --> 17:20.013
but a good surgeon
really can work wonders.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.193
Of course, at this stage, the main
worry is that he'll fail to thrive.

17:24.308 --> 17:27.666
To be honest, I didn't feel I knew
enough to offer much assistance.

17:27.692 --> 17:29.445
Well, that's easily remedied.

17:29.660 --> 17:33.260
I've a reference book with
a chapter on facial anomalies.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.682
If you can visualise the anatomy,

17:38.707 --> 17:41.685
you'll find it helps immeasurably
with the practical care.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.079
Phyllis,
can't I tempt you to a pedicure?

17:48.080 --> 17:51.079
One wouldn't want to reveal
unsandalworthy feet

17:51.080 --> 17:53.335
in this glorious warm weather.

17:53.453 --> 17:54.852
Rest assured, Trixie.

17:54.932 --> 17:57.882
In the unlikely event that
I should don sandals,

17:57.907 --> 18:00.106
they will be worn with
a pair of socks.

18:00.316 --> 18:02.595
My mother never approved
of painted toes.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.259
She said they were too forward.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.909
But a soft pastel in a pearl finish,
it's so elegant.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.956
It's what all the Italians
were wearing.

18:10.910 --> 18:14.510
Why shouldn't we bring a little
Portofino glamour to Poplar?

18:18.663 --> 18:20.816
Would you credit it?
The one time the

18:20.841 --> 18:22.855
wholesaler's delivery
comes early!

18:22.880 --> 18:24.840
I thought I'd never get away.

18:24.865 --> 18:26.620
Is no-one here yet?

18:26.645 --> 18:29.786
The surgery was advertised as
starting at nine sharp.

18:30.355 --> 18:32.451
How about we get you
settled in the café

18:32.476 --> 18:34.418
and I'll make you a
nice cup of tea?

18:34.450 --> 18:36.129
Well, just mind you put the sign up

18:36.154 --> 18:39.833
because I can't have people
traipsing in, looking for iced buns,

18:39.858 --> 18:42.498
when I'm conducting
private consultations.

18:49.202 --> 18:53.881
Martin, feel her head.
Do you think she's hot?

18:54.164 --> 18:55.643
Maybe a bit.

18:55.698 --> 18:56.897
Look how flushed she is.

18:56.922 --> 18:58.501
Or maybe she's teething.

18:58.526 --> 19:01.885
Hey, that it, sweetheart?
Getting your first tooth?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.359
She's been awake half the night.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.495
She's not the only one -
that sofa's hard as a rock.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.182
Been months since I got
a decent night's sleep.

19:07.206 --> 19:10.366
Martin, I'm serious - I think
there's something really wrong.

19:14.589 --> 19:18.353
A beach? Outside Nonnatus House?

19:19.284 --> 19:20.843
That is correct.

19:20.868 --> 19:24.867
I would like the council's
permission to create a sandpit

19:24.892 --> 19:27.820
in the courtyard
for Whitsun Bank Holiday.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.619
And you think this is a...
a good idea?

19:30.644 --> 19:34.563
Well, as Nurse Crane says, if the
young ones can't get to the seaside,

19:34.588 --> 19:36.467
then why don't we bring
the seaside to them?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.098
I know a man
I can see about some sand.

19:39.123 --> 19:42.802
I believe we could obtain all the
necessary materials as donations

19:42.827 --> 19:46.560
from local builders and tradesmen,
so there would be no cost entailed.

19:46.585 --> 19:50.224
I'm sorry, but I've never heard
anything so ridiculous.

19:50.249 --> 19:54.513
I mean, if people are that keen,
they can always go to Tower Beach.

19:54.829 --> 19:58.108
Oh, come on, Vi!
Where's your sense of fun?

19:58.133 --> 20:01.732
I have to act in the best
interests of the community.

20:01.757 --> 20:04.137
To my mind, this would be just that.

20:04.350 --> 20:08.390
It will certainly create
a strong feeling of civic pride.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.547
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

20:13.572 --> 20:19.015
If - and only if - you can guarantee
that every single grain of sand

20:19.040 --> 20:20.775
is cleared by Tuesday morning.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.776
You have my word, as an officer
of the law, Madam Councillor.

20:24.801 --> 20:26.680
Very well, then.

20:27.122 --> 20:28.612
We shall have a beach.

20:30.863 --> 20:34.103
BABY CRIES

20:36.980 --> 20:40.157
Nurse, I don't mean to be unkind -

20:40.220 --> 20:44.039
I know her baby's come out a bit
funny, but wouldn't it be better

20:44.040 --> 20:45.555
to move her to a room of her own?

20:45.894 --> 20:47.774
Better for who, exactly?

20:54.733 --> 20:57.492
I can't do it, Nurse! I just can't.

20:57.517 --> 21:01.956
My milk's in, and I've been
up all night with that flaming pump!

21:01.981 --> 21:05.820
I can hardly get anything,
and what I did get he won't take!

21:05.845 --> 21:07.135
You know, with the others,

21:07.160 --> 21:09.509
I just used to clamp 'em on
and we were away!

21:09.534 --> 21:11.154
Now look at me!

21:11.179 --> 21:14.178
And I can hear what
they're saying out there.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.655
Well,
they won't be saying it any more.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.319
Meanwhile, the pump can have
its marching orders.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.519
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

21:21.520 --> 21:23.479
I'll mix him a feed from
powdered milk,

21:23.480 --> 21:25.713
and we'll just concentrate on
getting it down him.

21:32.298 --> 21:33.817
Please, I need to see the doctor.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.119
Do you have an appointment?

21:35.120 --> 21:37.612
No, but I'm worried there's
something wrong with my baby.

21:37.637 --> 21:39.556
Then I shall endeavour to be
of assistance

21:39.600 --> 21:42.519
but, as you can see, there are
already several patients waiting.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.024
But she's very hot. I think
it might be something serious.

21:45.049 --> 21:47.608
Mrs Becker, everything all right?
Doctor...

21:47.633 --> 21:50.912
I was just explaining to Mrs Becker
that, without an appointment...

21:50.937 --> 21:53.167
Please, can you just take
a look at her?

21:53.192 --> 21:54.912
Something's not right, I know it.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.422
Please.

22:03.584 --> 22:05.503
She does have a slight temperature.

22:05.528 --> 22:07.871
But that's because she's teething.

22:08.450 --> 22:11.209
And you did have her quite
wrapped up for the time of year.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.288
All the books say to keep 'em warm.

22:13.313 --> 22:14.713
I haven't taken her out
without a hat and

22:14.737 --> 22:15.979
a matinee jacket
since she was born.

22:16.003 --> 22:18.709
The sunshine is good for them.
Good in what way?

22:19.356 --> 22:22.160
You don't need me to blind you
with science, but there are a lot...

22:22.185 --> 22:24.504
I do! You do need to
blind me with science.

22:24.529 --> 22:26.088
I need to know everything
about this.

22:26.113 --> 22:28.472
Everything about
bringing up a child.

22:28.569 --> 22:32.792
About getting things right,
about not letting things go wrong.

22:32.817 --> 22:35.976
It's normal to be anxious
around the first baby.

22:36.059 --> 22:38.626
But you're doing
really, really well.

22:38.651 --> 22:39.690
So far.

22:39.715 --> 22:43.450
She needs her mid-morning milk.
I have her on a very strict routine.

22:43.475 --> 22:46.748
We can have a chat about your
worries, if you aren't in a rush.

22:46.773 --> 22:49.013
No, I've already wasted
enough of your time.

23:02.394 --> 23:04.673
I'll admit I wasn't aware
the vaccination trial

23:04.698 --> 23:06.977
would generate
so much additional paperwork.

23:07.002 --> 23:11.478
Accurate record-keeping is the
cornerstone of medical advancement.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.335
Dr Turner might do well
to remember that

23:14.360 --> 23:17.171
before allowing all and sundry
access to my filing system.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.733
Well, we're all working towards
the same goal, aren't we?

23:20.758 --> 23:24.397
Miss Higgins tells me
you let Mrs Becker jump the queue.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.805
Mrs Becker was in rather a state
about her baby's temperature.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.458
Was anything wrong?

23:29.483 --> 23:32.550
With the baby, no -
a simple case of teething.

23:32.818 --> 23:35.337
But the mother was
rather in need of reassurance.

23:35.362 --> 23:36.641
They're new to the area.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.080
She may be feeling
a little isolated.

23:39.340 --> 23:41.219
Perhaps I should
try and look in on her?

23:41.244 --> 23:43.764
That would be
a very neighbourly thing to do.

23:44.734 --> 23:45.774
Excuse me, please.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.343
You might get on better...

23:50.516 --> 23:53.623
..if you can picture
what's going on inside.

23:54.103 --> 23:59.539
Try putting your finger
in his mouth, like this.

24:00.979 --> 24:03.656
And just gently feel for the hole.

24:03.681 --> 24:05.600
I'm scared I'll hurt him.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.344
It's not sore.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.597
It's not like it's an injury.
It's just the way he's made.

24:11.733 --> 24:13.080
Right. Yeah?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.280
There we are.

24:26.712 --> 24:28.538
God, it goes ever so far back.

24:28.913 --> 24:31.057
That's why we need to be careful
where the teat goes.

24:33.412 --> 24:35.620
Come on. Let's have another go.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.056
I think it's working!
I think he's getting something!

24:50.081 --> 24:52.520
You're good at this, Betty.

24:52.545 --> 24:53.585
Yeah, we'll see.

24:55.570 --> 24:58.009
It's all very well,
Nurse Crane coming up with this

24:58.120 --> 25:01.479
wild scheme of hers, but she's no
idea the level of planning involved.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.959
There's permits to organise, there's
road closures to be approved.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.799
Ooh, how did you
get on with the sand?

25:06.800 --> 25:10.239
All sorted - one tonne of
the finest quality builders' sand

25:10.240 --> 25:12.531
to be delivered
Saturday before Bank Holiday.

25:12.556 --> 25:13.734
Well done!

25:14.566 --> 25:18.565
I was thinking - we could have
some sort of opening ceremony,

25:18.590 --> 25:22.189
make a bit of an occasion of it,
perhaps we could ask the mayor?

25:22.214 --> 25:25.962
Or a certain very attractive
lady councillor?

25:26.572 --> 25:27.811
Oh, Fred! Don't be daft.

25:27.836 --> 25:31.522
Why not? After all, you're the one
that's making all this happen.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.079
Sister Hilda and Nurse Dyer,

25:36.080 --> 25:38.667
you will be assisting Mrs Turner
at the maternity home.

25:38.692 --> 25:42.491
Betty Marwick is to see the surgeon
at St Cuthbert's this afternoon,

25:42.516 --> 25:45.635
so she will need to be escorted to
and from the hospital with baby.

25:45.660 --> 25:46.709
Of course.

25:46.734 --> 25:48.517
Nurse Crane, do you know
anything about

25:48.542 --> 25:50.512
a rather large quantity of sand?

25:59.299 --> 26:01.619
I'm afraid it appears to be
blocking your car.

26:22.087 --> 26:23.127
Ready?

26:37.273 --> 26:39.172
It's a mother's worst nightmare,
isn't it?

26:45.291 --> 26:49.659
It was supposed to be delivered next
week and piled against the wall!

26:49.802 --> 26:50.840
Mm.

26:50.865 --> 26:54.151
I reckon Nolly Watling
got the wrong end of the stick.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.471
You think?

26:55.561 --> 26:58.858
Well, you did ask for a beach.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.354
It will have to be moved.

27:00.379 --> 27:04.018
I require access to my vehicle
at all times!

27:04.043 --> 27:06.083
Well, get to it, then, Fred.

27:08.018 --> 27:09.058
DOORBELL RINGS

27:10.493 --> 27:14.212
Mrs Becker, I'm sorry to call in
unannounced, but I understand

27:14.237 --> 27:17.436
from Dr Turner that your little
one's been suffering with her teeth.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.700
Er, yes, that's right.

27:19.880 --> 27:23.639
Well, I happen to have
some marvellous teething powders

27:23.640 --> 27:25.340
that I thought might help.

27:25.620 --> 27:26.998
That's very kind.

27:27.023 --> 27:28.167
I was just changing the bed.

27:28.192 --> 27:30.211
Oh, I won't hold you up.

27:30.383 --> 27:32.320
No. Please, come in.

27:33.887 --> 27:37.918
After the palate repair, your son
may have some difficulty breathing,

27:37.943 --> 27:39.782
in which case we shall intubate.

27:39.807 --> 27:41.966
And what's that?

27:42.066 --> 27:43.585
It's a very simple procedure.

27:43.610 --> 27:47.064
We insert a tube into the windpipe
which connects to a ventilator.

27:47.089 --> 27:49.128
Oh, God!

27:49.320 --> 27:53.496
It's unlikely he will require
assistance for more than a few days.

27:53.521 --> 27:57.480
However, your son may experience
some hearing loss moving forward,

27:57.505 --> 27:59.784
as well as dental and speech issues.

27:59.809 --> 28:03.443
But there's a great deal that can be
done with ongoing treatment.

28:03.468 --> 28:06.388
Now, do you have any questions,
Mrs Marwick?

28:12.011 --> 28:15.371
She's a smashing little eater!
And so bonnie.

28:17.315 --> 28:20.154
It must be quite lonely,
on your own with a little one,

28:20.320 --> 28:22.159
and in a new place to boot.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.839
I should be used to it.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.568
We moved all the time
when Martin was in the Army.

28:26.593 --> 28:30.374
Nevertheless, it's different
once you've a baby to care for.

28:30.399 --> 28:32.394
Yes, it is.

28:33.779 --> 28:38.211
I'm sorry about the other day
at the institute.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.012
- I shouldn't have got so upset.
- Not at all.

28:42.037 --> 28:44.237
We all just want to
keep our children safe.

28:47.314 --> 28:49.720
I'm afraid I shall
have to get going.

28:49.745 --> 28:52.384
No, I'll see myself out.

28:52.409 --> 28:54.888
But do come along to the playgroup
if you can.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.159
It's such a help to be able to
ask others for advice

28:58.160 --> 28:59.680
when you're a first-time mum.

29:01.109 --> 29:02.709
I'm not a first-time mum.

29:04.649 --> 29:05.689
You aren't?

29:08.401 --> 29:09.441
I'm sorry.

29:11.099 --> 29:12.978
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

29:13.003 --> 29:14.362
No.

29:14.387 --> 29:15.575
I don't talk about it.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.279
Not to anyone.

29:17.304 --> 29:19.304
Everybody said
that was the better way.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.333
Of course.

29:37.856 --> 29:39.840
At least now you know
what's to come.

29:39.983 --> 29:42.222
All those operations and treatments?

29:42.247 --> 29:44.857
We can make sure
you have help with the children.

29:44.882 --> 29:47.968
What, some stranger?
They won't want that.

29:49.088 --> 29:52.073
Betty, why not have the children
come and visit?

29:52.240 --> 29:53.759
Let them meet their little brother.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.537
It might make things feel
a bit more normal.

29:55.562 --> 30:00.789
No, it'll just upset 'em.
It's hard enough.

30:07.092 --> 30:10.572
Phyllis, I wondered if
I might ask a favour?

30:14.459 --> 30:16.298
I don't understand.

30:16.611 --> 30:18.370
You want to take his picture?

30:18.395 --> 30:21.868
I know you're worried Kirk's
appearance might come as a shock

30:21.893 --> 30:26.306
to the other children, so I thought,
if we show them a photograph

30:26.331 --> 30:29.411
and let them get used to it,
then it won't seem so frightening.

30:30.709 --> 30:32.269
I suppose.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.508
Let's find a clean bib, then,
shall we, Nurse?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.733
We want this young man
looking his best.

30:46.450 --> 30:50.924
Hazel Becker's previous GP
says that she gave birth to a son

30:51.080 --> 30:52.480
just over three years ago.

30:52.505 --> 30:54.424
So Dawn isn't her first baby?

30:54.449 --> 30:58.292
The little boy died in his sleep,
aged eight months.

30:58.724 --> 31:03.483
An unexplained death?
Was any cause found?

31:03.508 --> 31:05.080
There so seldom is.

31:05.105 --> 31:07.464
Imagine the torture for the parents.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.875
Apparently, poor
Hazel found the lack

31:09.900 --> 31:11.879
of an explanation
very, very hard.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.639
KNOCK ON DOOR Enter.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.599
Mrs Becker's notes, Dr Turner,
delivered by messenger.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.199
I did tip him out of the petty cash.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.319
But only sixpence
because he was chewing gum.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.559
Is the postmortem report included?

31:23.560 --> 31:25.679
I took the liberty of
placing it on the top.

31:25.704 --> 31:28.183
There's a particular detail
I felt you ought to note.

31:28.208 --> 31:32.407
I'm sure Doctor is quite capable of
directing his own investigations.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.959
The date of the demise
of the little boy.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.231
He died in May,
and an anniversary is approaching.

31:38.256 --> 31:40.255
Pain can be redoubled
at such a time,

31:40.280 --> 31:43.440
as those of us
who have been bereaved will testify.

31:47.894 --> 31:52.334
Hazel is locked in grief
and old patterns.

31:53.589 --> 31:56.429
Silence and secrecy
have made things worse.

32:05.678 --> 32:07.278
Just need my pillow.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.962
Will you at least
try and get some sleep? Of course.

32:14.987 --> 32:18.122
You can't watch her all night.
Shh! She's nearly asleep.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.880
I still think we should try
putting her in her own room.

32:20.905 --> 32:22.144
That way, you can sleep.

32:22.169 --> 32:24.899
Sleep through her crying?
Sleep through her choking?

32:24.924 --> 32:26.330
Sleep through her
stopping breathing?

32:26.354 --> 32:29.695
When is this going to stop, Hazel?
We can't carry on like this!

32:29.720 --> 32:30.905
BABY CRIES

32:30.930 --> 32:35.050
Now look what you've done!
Shh, it's OK.

32:37.387 --> 32:42.626
Shh! Shh!

32:43.033 --> 32:44.273
Get away!

32:47.400 --> 32:50.280
We shall have no defecation here!

32:53.090 --> 32:56.689
The thing to remember is that
Kirk looks quite poorly,

32:56.971 --> 32:59.252
but the doctors are going to be
able to make him better.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.540
Would you like to see
the picture too, Lynette?

33:08.842 --> 33:10.327
Hey!

33:10.352 --> 33:13.147
She's not stopped crying
since her mum went.

33:13.172 --> 33:14.531
And as for them boys!

33:14.556 --> 33:16.955
Betty's not so much brought them up

33:16.980 --> 33:19.422
as turned them loose
and let them run wild!

33:19.447 --> 33:21.832
And it's too much for me
with my rheumatics.

33:26.822 --> 33:27.828
Mum! Mum!

33:27.853 --> 33:29.979
Slowly, slowly now.
It's not a playground.

33:30.198 --> 33:31.677
Hello, baby Kirk!

33:31.702 --> 33:33.512
Careful there - mind your brother.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.879
So you are coming home now, are you?

33:35.880 --> 33:39.000
Because, I'm sorry, lovey,
this lot's more than I can take.

33:44.264 --> 33:45.864
Hey, shh, quiet!

33:52.004 --> 33:53.963
Just give it another couple of days.

33:53.995 --> 33:56.001
I can't. I need to go home.

33:56.026 --> 33:58.055
It'll be so much better
for Kirk if you stay.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.879
I've got six kids, not just one.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.475
And it's better for them
to have me home.

34:01.499 --> 34:02.709
When's your husband coming back?

34:02.733 --> 34:05.771
I don't know,
depends if he picks up another ship.

34:09.667 --> 34:12.449
I was also thinking about
a paddling pool.

34:12.741 --> 34:13.940
Oh, yes?

34:14.043 --> 34:17.853
Apparently, the Brownies had a great
big one at their summer jamboree.

34:18.226 --> 34:19.560
I think it would be just the thing.

34:19.583 --> 34:22.746
I mean, you can't have the beach
without the sea, can you?

34:22.771 --> 34:23.929
No, I suppose not.

34:24.194 --> 34:26.551
So I'll leave that to you, then.

34:26.576 --> 34:30.524
And if you can ask Sister Julienne
to sign the waiver on behalf

34:30.549 --> 34:33.068
of Nonnatus House regarding
road closures.

34:33.092 --> 34:35.972
And, of course, there's still
the decorations to finalise.

34:36.027 --> 34:40.041
Well, I had merely envisioned
a few swathes of bunting.

34:40.097 --> 34:42.576
But should you wish to provide
something more elaborate...

34:42.601 --> 34:44.905
Oh, no - bunting will be fine.

34:44.946 --> 34:46.824
Your towering edifice of dirt

34:46.920 --> 34:50.040
has been claimed by
the local feline population.

34:51.120 --> 34:56.790
Come Whitsun, I predict it shall be
contaminated beyond all repair.

34:56.815 --> 35:01.127
I shall speak to Mr Buckle
about finding some tarpaulins.

35:01.152 --> 35:04.463
Well, I think that seems to be
everything for now.

35:05.997 --> 35:09.449
Goodness! This really is becoming
quite a production.

35:09.836 --> 35:15.036
More like a three-ring circus, and I
think we know who the ringmaster is.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.282
I won't tell you again -
get back into bed!

35:28.803 --> 35:31.403
It's all right! It's all right!
We're nearly there.

35:33.719 --> 35:36.158
For God... It can't
still be too hot!

35:36.183 --> 35:37.503
Shh!

35:38.436 --> 35:39.555
What now?

35:39.580 --> 35:41.060
Lynette's wet the bed again.

35:46.015 --> 35:48.734
Mrs Becker, I'm so glad
you could come.

35:48.789 --> 35:51.469
I might not stay very long.
Had a bit of a broken night.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.239
They've sent through all these dates
for follow-up appointments -

35:57.240 --> 35:59.191
half a dozen of 'em - and it says
he's going to be at the hospital

35:59.215 --> 36:00.600
for at least a week!

36:00.625 --> 36:02.937
Look, what have I
said about fighting

36:02.962 --> 36:04.968
in the kitchen? Go on, get out!

36:05.133 --> 36:08.290
He will need quite a bit of time
to recover after the surgery.

36:08.315 --> 36:09.794
But this is just the start,
isn't it?

36:09.819 --> 36:12.152
I mean, the surgeon says
the other operations

36:12.177 --> 36:14.002
are going to be
even more serious.

36:14.164 --> 36:16.524
Here, I need to make up
another bottle.

36:18.027 --> 36:19.338
And that's another thing! You know,

36:19.362 --> 36:21.735
I thought formula was meant
to make it easy.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.199
Well, what with all the heating
and sterilising, and now I'm

36:24.200 --> 36:27.532
running out of the blessed stuff,
and I ain't got no time to buy any!

36:27.557 --> 36:29.917
Just sit down a minute.
I'll make up the bottle.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.442
Wasn't like this with the others.

36:33.467 --> 36:35.106
It was so easy with them.

36:35.131 --> 36:36.291
I knew what I was doing.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.894
He's feeling a bit hot.

36:39.919 --> 36:41.679
That'll be from all the screaming.

36:43.675 --> 36:44.715
Something wrong?

36:46.802 --> 36:50.799
♪ The driver on the bus
goes move on down

36:50.800 --> 36:53.479
♪ All day long

36:53.480 --> 37:00.039
♪ The babies on the bus go wa-wa-wa
Wa-wa-wa, wa-wa-wa

37:00.040 --> 37:02.664
♪ The babies on the bus go wa-wa-wa

37:02.689 --> 37:05.453
♪ All day long

37:05.478 --> 37:08.197
♪ The mothers on the bus go
shh-shh-shh

37:08.444 --> 37:09.376
♪ All day long... ♪

37:09.401 --> 37:11.572
No! Goodness!

37:11.680 --> 37:13.467
Did you see that?
She just hit my daughter!

37:13.492 --> 37:14.677
Oh, dear.

37:14.835 --> 37:16.874
- I'm so sorry.
- What is wrong with you?

37:16.899 --> 37:18.018
I didn't mean...

37:18.043 --> 37:21.282
Yeah, you should go - you're
not fit to be around children.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.346
You hear me?

37:22.371 --> 37:24.091
Let's all remain calm, shall we?

37:31.991 --> 37:33.031
Copper!

37:41.149 --> 37:42.988
Poor little soldier.

37:43.344 --> 37:47.615
I'm afraid it looks as though
he's breathed in some of the milk

37:47.640 --> 37:48.879
while he was feeding.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.973
It will have been
irritating his lungs.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.717
It's my fault. I couldn't
get it to go down the right way.

37:53.742 --> 37:55.877
You are doing really well, Betty.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.159
Feeding a baby like Kirk
can be a bit tricky

37:59.160 --> 38:00.807
till you get the hang of it.

38:00.832 --> 38:04.994
I will give you some antibiotics
to keep any infection at bay.

38:05.019 --> 38:06.039
I'm sorry.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.232
It's just so much harder now
I'm on me own at home.

38:08.257 --> 38:11.199
You're not on your own,
I promise you.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.532
You can phone for us at any time
of the night or day.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.757
And I will drop in and give this one
the once-over tomorrow.

38:25.020 --> 38:28.139
I've seen so many women struggling
on their own over the years.

38:28.164 --> 38:30.003
Husbands dead or drunk.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.555
Or in prison or at sea.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.130
Like Betty's other half.

38:34.155 --> 38:35.674
Most of them cope.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.855
But they don't always thrive.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.544
They need support,
if they're going to do that.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.046
Dr Turner?

38:42.071 --> 38:43.823
Nurse, erm...

38:43.848 --> 38:46.965
..I was hoping to speak to
Mrs Betty Marwick.

38:47.130 --> 38:49.010
Is now an appropriate moment
to call?

38:53.600 --> 38:56.058
This is not the first
time I've witnessed your

38:56.083 --> 38:58.672
son and his friend driving
in a reckless manner.

38:58.697 --> 39:00.668
You said Keith
wasn't the one driving.

39:00.693 --> 39:02.172
In this instance.

39:02.197 --> 39:05.636
But both your son and his friend
have repeatedly driven in

39:05.661 --> 39:09.580
such a manner to risk damage to
other vehicles, not to mention

39:09.640 --> 39:11.319
the potential to endanger life.

39:11.320 --> 39:14.168
- We never damaged anything.
- >Look, that is enough from you!

39:14.272 --> 39:16.791
- Is there anything else?
- Not at present.

39:16.816 --> 39:18.696
But I'll be keeping
my eye on you, son.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.414
As if I haven't enough to deal with!

39:25.439 --> 39:27.070
Go on - out of my sight!

39:28.878 --> 39:32.998
THUNDER RUMBLES

39:36.120 --> 39:37.998
Good girl. There we go.

39:41.489 --> 39:43.369
Oh, God! Oh, God!

39:48.640 --> 39:50.280
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, please!

40:01.720 --> 40:04.260
Do you know what I thought
last night?

40:04.285 --> 40:07.565
When Kirk wouldn't stop crying
and I couldn't do anything right?

40:10.813 --> 40:14.729
I thought it might've been better
if I'd let him slip away.

40:16.838 --> 40:19.675
Then he wouldn't have to
deal with all he's got to come.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.084
What kind of monster
does that make me?

40:22.366 --> 40:26.760
It doesn't make you a monster
in any way, shape or form.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.922
It makes you a mother, Betty.

40:30.204 --> 40:31.604
Because you want to protect him.

40:33.252 --> 40:38.119
When I had Keith, it was like
there was a party in the room.

40:39.395 --> 40:44.986
Me mum was still alive,
and she was there, me Auntie Rita,

40:45.011 --> 40:46.731
and the nun what delivered him.

40:48.229 --> 40:51.548
I had a hard time getting
his head out but, when I did,

40:51.573 --> 40:55.533
and when he cried,
I got a round of applause.

40:57.825 --> 41:02.384
I'd never had a round of applause
in me whole life!

41:02.509 --> 41:06.313
Even me husband clapped -
he was outside on the landing.

41:10.209 --> 41:11.808
But no-one's clapping now.

41:17.305 --> 41:19.480
Kirk'd be better off
with someone else.

41:21.693 --> 41:23.773
Someone who can
look after him properly.

41:30.059 --> 41:32.658
Please, I think my baby's dying!

41:32.683 --> 41:35.243
All right, you're here now.

41:35.268 --> 41:36.828
I'll fetch the doctor.

41:45.384 --> 41:46.983
It's measles, isn't it?

41:47.265 --> 41:48.904
She's caught it,
and now it's too late.

41:48.960 --> 41:51.159
It is a rash, but it's not measles.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.837
It's something called roseola
infantum, or sixth disease.

41:54.862 --> 41:57.080
Is that worse? Is it worse?

41:57.105 --> 41:58.582
- Is she going to die?
- No.

41:58.607 --> 42:00.462
It's just a mild virus.

42:00.578 --> 42:03.011
It's very common,
not serious at all.

42:03.046 --> 42:07.215
It will pass in a day or two, and
Dawn will be perfectly all right.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.927
You can't know that.
You can't be sure.

42:09.952 --> 42:12.432
I am absolutely sure.

42:15.951 --> 42:19.542
It must've been unbearably painful
to lose your little boy, Hazel.

42:23.672 --> 42:28.295
I don't tell people about that.
I don't talk about it.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.519
It's in your medical notes.

42:30.544 --> 42:32.105
And so it should be.

42:33.132 --> 42:37.652
A loss like that will make so many
things in your life so much harder.

42:39.078 --> 42:43.502
Including bringing up a lovely,
healthy baby, like Dawn.

42:43.678 --> 42:45.477
He was healthy, too.

42:45.502 --> 42:48.811
They said that. And he died.

42:50.211 --> 42:53.490
I wish I could give you a reason
why that happened, Hazel.

42:53.787 --> 42:57.586
But I can't now any more than
the doctors could then.

42:57.611 --> 43:01.611
I can only tell you that
you are a wonderful mother...

43:03.200 --> 43:05.680
..and I have every confidence
in you.

43:07.192 --> 43:08.232
Do you?

43:09.558 --> 43:10.917
Yes.

43:10.942 --> 43:12.422
I do.

43:14.356 --> 43:17.196
And one day, you will have
confidence in yourself again.

43:19.212 --> 43:20.852
Because you deserve to.

43:23.628 --> 43:26.187
I need to get her home, in the warm.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.707
There's a bus in a minute.

43:28.043 --> 43:29.644
You're not getting the bus.

43:29.956 --> 43:33.195
You have a long list
for this evening's rounds, Doctor.

43:33.220 --> 43:36.383
I have no objection to
driving Mrs Becker to her residence.

43:40.953 --> 43:42.352
Betty was very clear.

43:42.377 --> 43:45.176
She told me to contact
the adoption agency straight away.

43:45.325 --> 43:47.365
Are you certain
this is what she wants?

43:49.874 --> 43:51.434
I don't know.

43:53.046 --> 43:56.845
I mean, it's not as if
she's been coping since the birth.

43:57.010 --> 43:59.089
And it's taken its toll
on the whole family.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.135
Her eldest son's got himself
in trouble with the police,

44:02.160 --> 44:07.432
and now, with the baby ill,
she is really struggling.

44:08.213 --> 44:11.601
If it's a question of practical
support, that can be provided.

44:12.407 --> 44:16.486
Perhaps if Betty could be persuaded
to send the older children

44:16.511 --> 44:18.108
to school more regularly...

44:18.133 --> 44:19.561
It's more than that.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.955
She keeps saying it's not like
it was with the others.

44:22.980 --> 44:27.043
She doesn't seem to feel the urge
to cuddle him or show affection.

44:27.501 --> 44:30.424
I'm sure she's in
a very dark place at the moment.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.759
But a few hours of peace and quiet

44:33.760 --> 44:37.439
and a chance to get on top of
things, it should start to feel

44:37.440 --> 44:39.400
a great deal more manageable.

44:41.151 --> 44:44.540
I won't pretend there's
an easy solution, Nurse Dyer.

44:45.080 --> 44:49.000
But we need to help Betty
to start helping herself.

44:53.313 --> 44:55.112
DOOR OPENS

44:55.137 --> 44:56.537
Hazel, where have you been?

44:59.280 --> 45:01.599
Your wife had a bit of a scare,
Mr Becker,

45:01.600 --> 45:03.597
but there's nothing to worry about.

45:03.622 --> 45:05.102
- Hazel?
- I need to put her down.

45:14.048 --> 45:15.400
There we go.

45:32.681 --> 45:35.894
I know you've been through
a terrible time, my dear,

45:36.342 --> 45:37.956
losing a child.

45:38.912 --> 45:41.305
But you are stronger
than you realise.

45:42.735 --> 45:46.050
It's like an actual pain...

45:47.480 --> 45:50.000
..here, in my chest.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.840
And it never goes away.

45:54.107 --> 45:55.730
And I don't want it to go

45:57.662 --> 46:02.200
because that would mean
I was forgetting him.

46:18.499 --> 46:19.624
Is she all right?

46:19.649 --> 46:21.321
She seems a great deal calmer.

46:22.544 --> 46:24.343
Dr Turner did suggest
a mild sedative.

46:24.368 --> 46:27.337
No, she won't take it -
not after last time.

46:27.911 --> 46:31.543
The, er, the doctor in Cyprus
put her on something when Stephen...

46:33.227 --> 46:36.307
..when, erm, when our son died.

46:37.777 --> 46:40.607
The state she was in, she couldn't
even make it to the funeral.

46:41.327 --> 46:43.061
That's probably for the best.

46:43.760 --> 46:47.613
God knows, that was the hardest
thing I ever had to do.

46:49.294 --> 46:51.174
Standing there in the baking heat...

46:53.000 --> 46:55.440
..watching that little coffin
go into the ground.

46:57.028 --> 46:59.561
We all need the chance
to say goodbye.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.011
I suppose we do.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.080
KNOCK ON DOOR

47:07.943 --> 47:09.923
Thought I'd help you get
the kids off to school.

47:09.948 --> 47:11.145
If you want.

47:11.170 --> 47:12.888
Right, you lot,
where are your schoolbags?

47:12.913 --> 47:14.753
Ah! Not so fast!

47:17.882 --> 47:20.201
With your dad away,
you're the man of the house.

47:20.226 --> 47:21.464
So it's time you stepped up.

47:21.527 --> 47:24.486
From now on, I'm putting you
on Quartermaster's duty.

47:24.511 --> 47:25.669
You what?

47:26.420 --> 47:28.819
One tin of powdered milk on the go,
another in the cupboard.

47:28.844 --> 47:31.284
Soon as one runs out, you go to
the chemist and you replace it.

47:31.308 --> 47:32.348
Got it?

47:33.759 --> 47:34.959
Good.

48:09.492 --> 48:11.612
I need to talk about him, Hazel.

48:14.581 --> 48:19.148
If we don't, I'm scared about
what's going to happen to us.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.747
What it might end up doing to Dawn.

48:28.158 --> 48:31.747
Maybe I shouldn't have listened
to that doctor.

48:33.920 --> 48:38.508
Maybe if we'd have gone to
the funeral together...

48:38.533 --> 48:39.813
It wasn't your fault.

48:45.160 --> 48:47.280
You should've had a chance
to say goodbye.

49:01.020 --> 49:03.940
Right, off you pop.
Good boys. Come on.

49:05.800 --> 49:09.120
And you... see you later!

49:20.640 --> 49:22.720
HE LAUGHS Baby milk?

49:27.943 --> 49:30.882
What are you doing under there?
You hiding?

50:28.280 --> 50:30.319
THEY MUTTER

50:30.320 --> 50:31.799
Ignore 'em.

50:31.800 --> 50:34.959
Have a good look, why don't you?
That's my brother, all right?

50:34.960 --> 50:37.520
You got something to say about him,
you say it to me!

50:40.141 --> 50:42.325
Honestly! What are you like?

50:48.767 --> 50:49.806
3oz.

50:49.907 --> 50:52.826
No! Really?

50:52.851 --> 50:56.010
Well done, Betty.
You're doing brilliantly.

50:56.035 --> 50:58.115
I'd say your mummy's
earned a cuddle!

51:00.720 --> 51:02.519
And you're sure his chest is better?

51:02.520 --> 51:03.559
Temperature's normal.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.183
- He's a thriving, healthy little chap.
- Good.

51:06.208 --> 51:09.204
Cos now we've got to get him
through the operation.

51:09.229 --> 51:12.623
We heard back from Mrs Lightley
at the adoption agency.

51:12.648 --> 51:14.488
She said she could drop by tomorrow.

51:15.778 --> 51:16.938
Tell her not to bother.

51:42.156 --> 51:46.361
I understand from your husband that
your little boy is buried abroad.

51:47.828 --> 51:49.707
Yes, he is.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.819
Well, I can't imagine that
that is entirely helpful.

51:52.929 --> 51:53.949
No.

51:54.512 --> 51:56.551
I'm not from a large family.

51:56.576 --> 51:59.015
I have just the one uncle in Canada.

51:59.100 --> 52:01.499
And since my parents met
their untimely end,

52:01.524 --> 52:04.283
in the course
of an air raid in 1941,

52:04.308 --> 52:06.866
he has been unable
to visit their grave.

52:08.558 --> 52:11.918
Winnipeg being quite some distance
from East Finchley.

52:14.671 --> 52:18.032
My uncle planted a rose bush
in their memory.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.240
He sends me photographs of it
once in a while.

52:23.607 --> 52:26.447
And it brings us both comfort.

52:28.653 --> 52:31.373
I venture to hope that this
might do the same for you.

52:35.520 --> 52:39.320
That's most kind. It really is.

52:47.273 --> 52:48.753
Thank you.

52:53.350 --> 52:56.909
Donny! When did you get home?

52:56.934 --> 52:59.453
I came off the ship
about an hour ago.

52:59.835 --> 53:00.875
Can I see him?

53:02.176 --> 53:03.216
Come here, then.

53:20.040 --> 53:23.400
Oh, look at him! He's gorgeous!

53:38.694 --> 53:41.053
- Now, there's a cheering sight.
- Isn't it?

53:41.360 --> 53:44.579
Angela asked me today if she could
tell people May was her sister.

53:44.604 --> 53:45.633
Did she?

53:45.658 --> 53:48.054
They're really becoming very close.
It's lovely.

53:48.760 --> 53:53.524
I was thinking that some people foster
children for years, don't they?

53:54.691 --> 53:55.731
It does happen.

53:57.324 --> 53:59.383
Right, come on, then!
We don't want to be late.

53:59.408 --> 54:00.547
In you pop.

54:01.981 --> 54:05.012
Come on, Reggie! Spit spot!
It's nearly half past.

54:06.645 --> 54:07.685
Will we do?

54:08.396 --> 54:11.076
Oh! Just look at my handsome boys!

54:13.366 --> 54:14.686
Madam Councillor?

54:23.238 --> 54:24.598
VIOLET CLEARS HER THROAT

54:26.378 --> 54:30.417
On behalf of the Tower Hamlets
London Borough Council,

54:30.590 --> 54:33.349
it gives me the greatest of
pleasure to declare this

54:33.374 --> 54:37.774
Poplar Whitsun Bank Holiday
Play Beach open for business!

54:41.360 --> 54:43.160
Oh, I feel like the Queen!

54:46.960 --> 54:48.200
In you go! In you go!

55:21.320 --> 55:23.479
Tempted to have a paddle, Sister?

55:23.480 --> 55:24.920
Just you try and stop me!

55:26.400 --> 55:28.320
- What's it like?
- Ooh!

55:40.445 --> 55:42.604
Three cheers for Akela! Hip hip...

55:42.629 --> 55:44.108
Hooray!

55:44.133 --> 55:46.247
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

55:46.272 --> 55:48.071
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

55:55.040 --> 55:56.319
That ice cream's melting.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.360
Boo!

55:58.094 --> 56:01.053
We can decide to be happy,

56:01.078 --> 56:03.117
make much out of little,

56:03.142 --> 56:06.182
embrace the warmth of
our ordinary days.

56:07.730 --> 56:11.745
Life unfolds as a mystery.

56:12.528 --> 56:15.877
An enterprise whose outcome
cannot be foretold.

56:16.902 --> 56:19.621
We do not get what we expect.

56:19.646 --> 56:23.838
We stumble on cracks,
are faced with imperfection.

56:24.229 --> 56:26.509
Bonds are tested and tightened.

56:28.224 --> 56:32.595
And our landscapes shift
in sunshine and in shade.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.079
There is light.

56:35.547 --> 56:37.146
There is.

56:37.310 --> 56:38.350
Look for it.

56:39.465 --> 56:44.424
Look for it shining over
your shoulder, on the past.

56:44.605 --> 56:47.884
It was light where you went once.

56:47.909 --> 56:50.484
It is light where you are now.

56:52.139 --> 56:55.059
It will be light
where you will go again.

57:06.361 --> 57:09.320
Gentle, rhythmic circles.

57:09.345 --> 57:10.784
Ooh, I've come over a bit funny.

57:10.809 --> 57:13.008
Where are you off to
in your next-best two-piece suit?

57:13.033 --> 57:14.835
An exhibition of photography.

57:14.860 --> 57:17.940
What are horizons for
if not to be expanded?

57:20.200 --> 57:23.039
Are you asking to arrange
a termination of your pregnancy?

57:23.040 --> 57:24.842
If that's the polite way
of putting it.

57:24.867 --> 57:25.907
Faster!

57:26.305 --> 57:32.879
