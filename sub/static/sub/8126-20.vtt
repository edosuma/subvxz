ma, who's that at the door?
It's a package for me
by special messenger.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.870
Ooh, it looks exciting.
Who's it from?
It don't say.

01:11.937 --> 01:15.306
I wonder what it can be.
Open it up.

01:15.374 --> 01:18.442
The last time
I had a package this size...

01:18.510 --> 01:21.612
Was from your grandmother
on your father's side--

01:21.681 --> 01:26.584
a beautiful lace tablecloth
over 80 years old.

01:26.652 --> 01:31.355
I don't remember seeing that.
That's because I've been
saving it for best.

01:31.423 --> 01:34.559
But we ain't had no best.

01:34.626 --> 01:38.797
Open up the package.
What do you think it is, Gloria?

01:38.864 --> 01:42.834
Ma, if you don't open it up,
I'll go crazy.
Right.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.936
Oh, it's a beautiful box.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.940
I'm gonna save it.
It'll come in hand--

01:49.008 --> 01:54.245
oh, Gloria,
this can't be for me.

01:54.313 --> 01:58.049
It's a mink cape.
It's beautiful.

01:58.117 --> 02:02.353
You know, I've seen this
somewhere before.

02:02.421 --> 02:04.823
Oh, there must be
some mistake.

02:04.890 --> 02:08.193
No, ma. It's no mistake.
It's from your cousin Amelia.

02:08.259 --> 02:13.131
Amelia. That's where
I've seen it, on Amelia.

02:15.367 --> 02:18.970
But why would she be
sending me her mink cape?

02:19.038 --> 02:20.972
"Dear Edith,
I'm giving this to you...

02:21.040 --> 02:24.909
Because of your kindness
in looking after me
after I had my operation."

02:24.977 --> 02:28.079
Oh, she didn't have to do that.

02:28.147 --> 02:31.249
"I know you'll say I
don't have to do this, Edith,

02:31.316 --> 02:33.718
but I really want you
to have the mink."

02:33.786 --> 02:36.287
Oh, ain't that nice?

02:36.355 --> 02:39.758
I wonder why she sent it.
They're coming over on Friday.

02:39.825 --> 02:44.562
"I know we're coming over
Friday, but I couldn't
wait for you to have it."

02:44.630 --> 02:49.868
Oh, that's very nice.
But what will Amelia
do without it?

02:49.935 --> 02:53.471
"Russ is buying me a new one
for my birthday anyway.

02:53.538 --> 02:56.074
Love, Amelia."
Oh, ma, put it on.

02:56.142 --> 03:00.645
You know,
I've always wondered
what mink felt like.

03:00.712 --> 03:02.647
What does it feel like, ma?

03:02.714 --> 03:07.718
It feels just like soft fur.

03:09.621 --> 03:11.555
<i>[ Door opens ]</i>
<i>[ Michael ]</i>
<i>Hi, Gloria. I'm home.</i>

03:11.623 --> 03:14.192
Oh, ma, that's Michael.
You stay in here
until I call you.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.361
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're home.
Hi.

03:17.429 --> 03:20.298
Stand right there.
I've got a big surprise for you.
What's going on?

03:20.365 --> 03:22.700
You'll see.
Ready, ma?
Yeah.

03:23.769 --> 03:26.304
¶ There she is ¶

03:26.371 --> 03:31.109
¶ miss America ¶

03:37.649 --> 03:41.352

03:41.420 --> 03:44.923
I don't believe it, ma.
It can't be you.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.425
Oh, yeah, Mike.
It's me.

03:47.492 --> 03:49.627
Ma, that's mink.
Where did that come from?

03:49.695 --> 03:53.798
It's Amelia dekuyper's way
of saying thank you.
Gee, that's some thank you.

03:53.866 --> 03:59.237
I'm gonna have to find
someplace fancy to wear this.

03:59.305 --> 04:03.674
Only Archie don't take me
to no mink places.

04:03.742 --> 04:07.411
Archie don't take you
to no places.

04:07.479 --> 04:09.914
Oh, Mike.
That ain't fair.

04:09.982 --> 04:13.852
It's true,
but it ain't fair.

04:13.919 --> 04:19.357
I gotta see
what this looks like
in the bathroom door.

04:19.423 --> 04:22.593
That's something.
I didn't know cousin
Amelia was that rich.

04:22.661 --> 04:24.963
Well, her husband's
a plumbing contractor.

04:25.030 --> 04:29.000
Oh, yeah.
They make half a mink a day.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.002
Boy, I wanna tell you.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.605
Coming home through this city
some nights is like coming
through a minefield.

04:34.673 --> 04:38.009
Daddy, you should see
what ma just got.
I'm talking, Gloria.

04:39.611 --> 04:41.545
I leave work and
I go down the subway, see.

04:41.613 --> 04:45.483
Your mayor Lindsay's
two-level trolley system.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.552
And what do I find there?
The subway platform
is jammed with peoples.

04:48.620 --> 04:53.291
It's a wall-to-wall melting pot.
Why? 'Cause the trains ain't
running again.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.494
Well, that's too bad--
so, looking for somebody
who speaks my language,

04:56.561 --> 04:58.696
I go up to this subway guard.

04:58.764 --> 05:01.966
And he happens to be one of your
pushy "imported" ricans.

05:04.336 --> 05:07.638
And so I says to him,
you know, trying to be polite,

05:07.706 --> 05:10.008
"what's up, Pedro?"

05:13.212 --> 05:15.746
He says, "the main's broke.
The water's flooding the rails."

05:15.814 --> 05:19.650
"How am I gonna get home?"
He says, "try swimming
up the tracks."

05:20.986 --> 05:24.188
Now I ask you, for a city
employee to talk to an--

05:24.256 --> 05:26.724
I'm all alone here.
When did this happen?

05:26.792 --> 05:30.361
What, are you hiding someplace?
Where the hell are you?

05:30.429 --> 05:32.931
What's going on?
Daddy, you just stand
right there, okay?

05:32.998 --> 05:34.933
Where's your mother?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.835
¶ Here she comes ¶

05:37.903 --> 05:41.239
¶ miss America ¶

05:42.308 --> 05:44.409
¶ here she comes ¶

05:44.476 --> 05:47.478

¶ the dreams

05:54.553 --> 05:56.887
¶ may come true ¶

05:56.956 --> 06:00.458
¶ in Atlantic city ¶
hey, hey.

06:00.525 --> 06:03.727
Pull the plug on that, huh?

06:03.795 --> 06:06.630
Well, how do you
like it, Archie?

06:06.698 --> 06:10.268
I thought we were saving
our green stamps for a camera.

06:12.104 --> 06:15.440
That's a beautiful fur there.
She looks fabulous.
Can't you say something nice?

06:15.507 --> 06:20.378
What's nice about it?
It probably took every
stamp book we had.

06:20.446 --> 06:24.082
No, Archie.
It's a present
from cousin Amelia...

06:24.149 --> 06:26.750
For looking after
her gall bladder.

06:28.354 --> 06:32.156
Oh, a present
from cousin Amelia, huh?
Mm-hmm.

06:32.224 --> 06:36.194
- Well, give it back.
- Oh, Archie. Why?

06:36.261 --> 06:38.196
Because a present
from cousin Amelia...

06:38.263 --> 06:41.265
Is also a present from
your cousin-in-law Russ too.

06:41.333 --> 06:44.068
And you ain't accepting
no gifts from Russel dekuyper.

06:44.136 --> 06:46.737
But daddy,
ma did something
nice for Amelia.

06:46.805 --> 06:50.541
Now Amelia's doing
something nice for ma.
Yeah, she earned that cape.

06:50.609 --> 06:53.011
Listen, Sonny boy.
In the first place,

06:53.078 --> 06:56.580
earning is a subject
you know nothing about.

06:59.351 --> 07:02.053
And in the second place,
that cape ain't earned.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.956
That's charity,
which Archie bunker don't take
from nobody in the third place.

07:06.025 --> 07:09.760
What charity, arch? It's a gift.
That isn't largesse.

07:09.828 --> 07:15.733
I ain't saying
it's largesse, "smallesse"
or any kind of "esse."

07:15.800 --> 07:18.936
When I want my wife
to have a fur coat,
I'll buy her a fur coat.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.639
You will?
No.

07:24.443 --> 07:27.845
Daddy, can't you understand
how ma feels about having
her very own mink?

07:27.913 --> 07:33.584
I can understand that she's
gonna give that fur cape back
to the dekuypers, that's all.

07:33.652 --> 07:35.953
Russ dekuyper.
He's rich.

07:36.021 --> 07:38.622
So he's always lauding it
over the whole world.

07:38.690 --> 07:42.126
He spends his life looking
for wounds to rub salt into.

07:42.194 --> 07:45.196
He sure found one with you.
You're practically green
with jealousy.

07:45.264 --> 07:48.399
What are you talking about?
Jealous of who, Russ dekuyper?

07:48.467 --> 07:51.102
Why, the man ain't
got of a gleaming feature.

07:51.170 --> 07:54.705
He ain't smart.
He ain't certainly
what you'd call good-looking.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.707
You mean like you?

07:58.810 --> 08:03.448
Well, now that you mention,
yeah. Ask Edith.
She knows the two of us.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.817
Who's better looking Edith, me
or that dumb dutchman dekuyper.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.988
You are, Archie, by far.
Satisfied?

08:11.056 --> 08:13.091
Can I keep the cape now?

08:13.158 --> 08:15.093
No.

08:16.895 --> 08:20.864
Now will you quit fooling around
and get chow on the table?
All right, Archie.

08:20.932 --> 08:23.667
Oh, boy.
"Oh, boy."
Yeah. Yeah.

08:23.735 --> 08:25.869
And what are you
looking at anyway?

08:25.937 --> 08:28.839
I'm surprised at youse two
"ecrology" nuts...

08:28.907 --> 08:31.442
Encouraging your mother
there to wear fur.

08:31.510 --> 08:36.581
They breed those animals, daddy.
That's right, arch. Mink is not
an endangered species.

08:36.648 --> 08:40.251
Oh, geez.
Them minks hangin' around your
mother-in-law's neck out there,

08:40.318 --> 08:44.020
they'll be glad to hear that--
that they ain't endangered,
just murdered.

08:44.089 --> 08:47.225
Besides, your mother-in-law
ain't a mink-type person.

08:47.292 --> 08:53.131
I mean, it's like puttin'
a white tie and tails
on the meathead here.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.168
Hold it, Edith.
Wait a minute.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.570
Is this all we're having?
Oh, no, Archie.

08:59.638 --> 09:03.441
We're having spaghetti just
the way you like it-- long.

09:03.509 --> 09:06.544
Oh. I like it short.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.247
I thought you liked it long...

09:09.314 --> 09:14.485
Except in the case of elbow
macaroni which is short
because it's bent.

09:17.822 --> 09:20.358
You're a pip,
you know that, Edith?

09:20.425 --> 09:22.360
A real pip.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.796
- Go on.
Get me the long spaghetti.
- Right away, Archie.

09:25.864 --> 09:28.932
Your mother's getting
dingbattier than ever
with that cape around her there.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.135
And that's why
that Russ dekuyper
sent it over here,

09:31.203 --> 09:33.337
to "percolate"
my family against me.

09:33.405 --> 09:35.339
To fill their minds
with the thought...

09:35.407 --> 09:37.841
That I ain't
rich enough to buy my wife
the thing she wants.

09:37.909 --> 09:41.812
- Well, daddy, you're not.
- You see that? It's poisoning
your mind already.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.248
I'm not gonna stand for this.
Edith, before you
sit down to eat,

09:44.316 --> 09:46.250
you get on the phone,
you call the dekuypers.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.252
You tell Amelia
you're giving back that cape.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.122
Oh, no, Archie.
I can't do that. I can't
hurt her feelings that way.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.659
Oh, well,
if you can't, I can.

09:54.726 --> 09:57.795
I'll make the phone call
myself, that's all.
Archie, please don't do that.

09:57.862 --> 10:01.265
Don't tell me what to do, Edith.
Just get the spaghetti
on the table.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.868
But Archie--
no, don't "but" me "but" me.
Just do what you're told.

10:04.936 --> 10:08.272
Archie, I'll give the cape back,
but don't insult them.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.576
Oh, no.
I'm gonna straighten out
Russ dekuyper right now.

10:11.643 --> 10:14.912
Daddy, they're
coming over here Friday.
Why can't you wait till then?

10:14.979 --> 10:18.549
Because I wanna throw
that cape back into his face
while I'm in the mood.

10:18.617 --> 10:21.352
Arch--
go on, Edith.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.354
Dummy up.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.823
Hello?
Hey, is that you, Russ?

10:25.890 --> 10:27.825
This is Archie bunker here.

10:27.892 --> 10:30.761
Yeah, uh, Russ,
about that fur cape
you sent over here.

10:30.829 --> 10:32.763
Well, Edith can't use it.

10:32.831 --> 10:35.533
No, no, no.
She can't take your fur, Russ.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.202
Cat fur, rabbit,
anything like that, you know.

10:38.270 --> 10:42.340
Yeah, she's got, uh--
what do you call these--
allergies.

10:42.407 --> 10:46.009
Yeah. Oh, geez.
She's sneezing her
face off right now.

10:46.077 --> 10:49.012
Gesundheit in there, Edith.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.014
I just wanna say,
when you come over
Friday night...

10:51.082 --> 10:55.419
You pick up the fur and you
give it away to the "salivation"
army or something like that.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.821
Russ, I can't talk now
because they're serving dinner.

10:57.889 --> 11:00.558
I gotta go.
That's all. Good-bye.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.560
Well, it's final now, Edith!

11:02.628 --> 11:05.095
You're gonna
give back that cape!

11:22.714 --> 11:25.383
What are we gonna eat now?

11:31.122 --> 11:33.056
What's keeping
your mother-in-law?

11:33.124 --> 11:35.593
The dry cleaners is only
two blocks away here.

11:35.661 --> 11:39.297
You know, when I think of you
making her give back that fur,
I get sick to my stomach.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.834
Look at you. You could eat
the carpets off the floor...

11:43.902 --> 11:46.637
Without getting
sick to your stomach.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.808
Michael.
Ma got those goodies
for Russ and Amelia.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.243
Besides, we're going
to eat after the movie.

11:53.312 --> 11:57.014
Oh, my.
Sorry I took so long.

11:57.081 --> 12:01.786
Oh, let me catch my breath.
Never mind about your breath.
You can breathe later.

12:01.853 --> 12:05.656
Russ and Amelia are coming
over here any minute, huh?
Where's the cape?

12:05.724 --> 12:07.658
They're keeping it.

12:07.726 --> 12:11.395
The jeffersons have been
cleaning that cape for six days.
Ain't they done yet?

12:11.463 --> 12:14.432
He had terrible trouble
with that stain.

12:14.499 --> 12:18.436
He had to put
the mink through twice
and it still wouldn't come out.

12:18.503 --> 12:20.604
Well, he should have
put it through a third time.

12:20.672 --> 12:23.073
That's just it.
He shouldn't have.
The third time,

12:23.141 --> 12:27.345
the fur came out
in big patches.

12:27.412 --> 12:30.848
Are you telling me that
Jefferson ruined that fur?
Edith, I'll sue the guy.

12:30.915 --> 12:32.850
He was very upset about it,

12:32.917 --> 12:37.455
but he says that he'll
get his insurance company
to clear it right away.

12:37.522 --> 12:40.391
Why did you bring it
down to the jeffersons'
in the first place?

12:40.459 --> 12:43.527
I mean, the colored people
don't know nothing
about dry cleaning.

12:43.595 --> 12:46.063
What do they know about fur?

12:46.130 --> 12:49.967
That's right, arch.
All we taught them was
how to work with cotton.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.676
Go carry a sign, will ya?

13:00.645 --> 13:05.215
Mr. Jefferson said
we might get as much as $300.

13:05.283 --> 13:10.755
Edith, don't never bring
no more clean-- $300?

13:10.822 --> 13:15.860
Yeah, he said it would be that
because it was not new fur.

13:15.927 --> 13:18.662
Well, wait a minute.
Edith, $300?

13:18.730 --> 13:20.798
Hey, wait a second, arch.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.033
You're not thinking of keeping
that money, are you?

13:23.101 --> 13:25.369
I might be.

13:27.038 --> 13:30.508
- Why not?
- You already told Russ you
were gonna give back the cape.

13:30.575 --> 13:32.476
But there ain't no cape now.

13:32.544 --> 13:35.746
Oh, gee, arch.
When it was just a fur cape,
you couldn't care less.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.783
Now it's $300,
your whole world lights up.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.984
Would you listen to this guy?
You know something
about yourself?

13:41.052 --> 13:43.153
You ain't got
no class at all.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.723
What do you expect me to do,
insult a relation,

13:45.791 --> 13:50.528
a rich relation at that,
by offering him $300?

13:50.595 --> 13:52.897
Arch, I thought
you didn't wanna take charity.

13:52.964 --> 13:56.767
This ain't charity.
This is gonna be a check
from an insurance company.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.269
And if you think insurance
companies give out charity,

13:59.337 --> 14:01.906
you're a lot dumber
than I ever gave you credit for.

14:01.973 --> 14:05.709
Archie, it's the dekuypers'
money because it was their
cape that got damaged.

14:05.777 --> 14:07.812
How can you honestly
think of keeping the money?

14:07.879 --> 14:12.115
The same way a lot of people
keep millions of dollars,
don't pay no taxes.

14:12.183 --> 14:15.319
Like, uh, for instance
your Ronald Reagan there.

14:17.622 --> 14:20.491
You're throwing
that example up to me?

14:22.594 --> 14:26.630
Certainly, meathead.
That is the way the system
is supposed to work.

14:26.698 --> 14:30.133
And Reagan is a guy
who knows how to work it.

14:30.201 --> 14:33.203
Archie, that's not the way
the system's supposed to work.

14:33.271 --> 14:35.539
I told you about Ronald Reagan,
you bawled hell out of me...

14:35.607 --> 14:37.541
For besmirching the name
of a great governor.

14:37.609 --> 14:40.077
And don't do it no more.

14:42.180 --> 14:45.282
Because the U.S. of a. Is run
along certain principles.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.018
And giving back $300
to a man who don't need it...

14:48.086 --> 14:51.154
Goes against everything
this nation stands for.

14:51.222 --> 14:54.525
If that's what this nation
stands for, then the people have
been devalued, not the dollar.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.326
Nuts to you.
Yeah?

14:56.394 --> 14:58.328
You was supposed to be
going to the movies. Get lost.

Now, say nothing.
Don't you open your mouth and
say word one about that cape.

You make like
an oyster and clam up.

How are you?
Good.

Oh, Archie.

15:38.102 --> 15:41.805
You look terrific.
You put a few pounds on,
but you look terrific.

15:41.873 --> 15:44.675
Arch, you ain't changed a bit.
Same old arch.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.277
Same old Russ.
Same old Edith too.

15:47.345 --> 15:49.346
Same old living room.

of what I come up from.

15:54.252 --> 15:57.054
[ No audible dialog ]

16:02.894 --> 16:07.431
Arch, what Russ means
is we're more like
what you'd call pink people.

16:07.498 --> 16:11.101
Aw, hey.
We got a son-in-law
who's one of them.

16:11.169 --> 16:14.137
Hey, come on, Amelia.
Sit down on the sofa here.

16:14.205 --> 16:16.139
You do the decorating
yourself, Edith?

16:16.207 --> 16:20.578
Oh, no, no. I ain't
too good at that, Amelia.

16:20.645 --> 16:25.482
But I did paint
the laundry basket once
with one of them spray cans.

16:25.550 --> 16:28.185
Remember, Archie?
Yeah, forget it.

16:28.252 --> 16:31.789
But I-- I forgot
to take the laundry out.

16:34.492 --> 16:39.663
And Archie was wearing
wicker pattern underwear
for a whole year.

16:39.731 --> 16:42.365
Private, Edith, huh?
Private.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.636
Hey, arch,
about that mink cape.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.605
Cape?
Wh-what about it?

16:47.672 --> 16:51.909
I don't believe none of that
guff you was giving me
about Edith's allergies.

16:51.977 --> 16:54.979
It was only you being
allergic to charity, wasn't it?

16:55.046 --> 16:57.147
Russ, I never
thought of that as charity.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.149
What do you mean?
Coming from you?

16:59.217 --> 17:03.821
Good. Because Amelia and me,
we want Edith to keep the cape.

17:03.888 --> 17:09.660
Why shouldn't she have
a little luxury in her life?
I mean, look around here.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.429
- Russel.
- Listen, Amelia.
Listen. That's okay.

17:12.497 --> 17:16.000
I mean, after all,
some guys make it
and some guys don't.

17:16.067 --> 17:20.537
So youse two wanna give
that fur cape to Edith here,
well, I say beautiful.

17:20.605 --> 17:23.573
- But Archie,
how can we keep the cape?
- Beautiful.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.575
Beautiful.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.949
Is there something in your eye?

17:36.287 --> 17:38.455
Would you make coffee?

17:38.523 --> 17:42.726
Wait a minute, Edith.
First I gotta see what
you look like in that fur.

17:42.794 --> 17:45.863
- Try it on.
- Oh, Amelia, I-I--

17:45.930 --> 17:48.165
she, uh, she can't
do that, Amelia, see?

17:48.232 --> 17:51.035
'Cause the cape is
still at the dry cleaners.

17:51.102 --> 17:54.004
But I had it cleaned just
before I sent it to you.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.540
Oh, well, uh, you know,
Edith done it again...

17:56.607 --> 17:59.409

these colored people.

- Colored?
- Yeah. Oh, hey.

18:08.252 --> 18:11.254
But, listen, they're great.
Didn't you ever hear?

18:11.322 --> 18:14.992
I mean, they get right in there.
The benzine, it don't do
nothing to them there.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.830
I mean, they're
really great at doing furs.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.932
They're real geniuses
in the cleaning profession.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.802

Where's your bathroom?

18:24.869 --> 18:26.804

This is Mrs. Jefferson.

Uh, Mrs. Jefferson,
could we talk to you about all
of this just a little later on?

20:09.841 --> 20:14.077
Oh, sure. But I was just
so upset about what happened
to the mink cape.

20:14.145 --> 20:18.481
-Something happened to the cape?
-It sure was a shame you spilt
all of that sauce on it.

I'll tell you what you do.
Just don't worry about it...

the cape as soon as
ever you can, huh?

but the skin.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.061
Russ, you ain't
leaving this house...

23:51.129 --> 23:53.663
Till I finish saying to you
what I wanna say to you.

23:53.731 --> 23:56.133
What do you wanna say to me?

23:56.200 --> 23:58.235
I'll split that with you.

23:58.302 --> 24:01.438
Come on, Amelia.
Russ, Russ, don't you walk
out of here with that check.

24:01.506 --> 24:06.543
Russ, if you leave this
house with that there
check there, Russ,

24:06.610 --> 24:09.179
it ain't gonna do
our friendship no good.

24:10.981 --> 24:14.251
<i>[ Car starts, pulls away ]</i>

24:23.694 --> 24:27.030
Once again,
your side of the family.

24:33.204 --> 24:37.074
Come on, daddy,
stop sulking about Russ.

24:37.141 --> 24:40.110
Boy, no wonder they say that
money's the root of all evil.

24:40.178 --> 24:42.112
Yeah, that's right, arch.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.847
Russ only did unto you what
you were trying to do to him.

24:45.916 --> 24:48.285
And remember,
the Bible also says...

24:48.352 --> 24:51.654
It is more blessed
to give than to receive.

24:57.795 --> 25:00.464
I got one for you.

25:00.531 --> 25:02.865
Silence is golden.

25:04.535 --> 25:07.537
So stifle thyself, will you.

25:25.289 --> 25:30.026
