00:01.086 --> 00:02.671
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.879 --> 00:04.839
Gabriel cut the Utopium
the night of the boat party.

00:07.092 --> 00:09.427
Tell me what you cut
the Utopium with,
and I will cure you.

00:09.636 --> 00:11.304
This is FBI Agent Dale Bozzio.

00:11.513 --> 00:13.807
She'll be looking into a string
of missing person cases.

00:14.015 --> 00:18.269
Check a few zombie souls off
your little list, like a good boy.

00:18.478 --> 00:22.273
Major?
This dude was trying to keep
us off drugs!

00:22.482 --> 00:23.858
I need help.

00:34.828 --> 00:37.914
- What are we doing?
- Well, it's hard to put
a label on it just yet.

00:38.123 --> 00:39.332
But I'll get
back to you in a minute.

00:42.127 --> 00:43.753
We should stop.

00:43.962 --> 00:46.006
We don't know
enough about how zombie
is transferred.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.550
All this kissing.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.635
I've been kissed
by blonde Liv before.

00:50.844 --> 00:52.721
Still human.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.223
But that wasn't
as prolonged and there were
no tongues involved.

00:57.726 --> 00:59.936
Do you have any open sores
in your mouth?

01:01.563 --> 01:02.605
Sexy.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.860
How hard have you been
brushing your teeth?

01:07.068 --> 01:07.986
So hard.

01:09.362 --> 01:11.448
That's it.

01:11.656 --> 01:15.744
Kissing moratorium
until we're sure I didn't just
turn you into a zombie.

01:15.952 --> 01:18.580
So, we're going the <i>Pretty Woman</i>
no-kissing-on-the-mouth route.

01:18.788 --> 01:20.331
- I'm down.
- Oh, my God.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.168
Horny boys are the worst.
When all your blood returns

01:23.376 --> 01:25.670
to the normal locations
in your body,

01:25.879 --> 01:28.465
you're going to care whether
that make-out session has left
you living or living dead.

01:29.883 --> 01:31.509
<i>...on the drive.</i>

01:31.718 --> 01:34.846
<i>Left-handed lay-up! No good!</i>

01:35.055 --> 01:36.556
- Hey. What you got
there, mister...

01:36.765 --> 01:37.891
<i>He shoots!</i>

01:39.476 --> 01:41.102
<i>He scores!</i>

02:13.343 --> 02:15.553
- How are you feeling?
- Great.

02:15.762 --> 02:19.599
Who doesn't enjoy waking
up to a beautiful woman
cutting off his circulation?

02:19.808 --> 02:22.310
Pulse seems normal.
Pallor's okay.

02:22.519 --> 02:25.063
BP's 116 over 77.

02:25.271 --> 02:27.732
No alarm bells yet,
but the truest test,

02:27.941 --> 02:28.858
coffee.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.948
Is that look of disgust
because you need
cream and sugar,

02:35.156 --> 02:36.616
or because you need habanero?

02:36.825 --> 02:38.701
It's because you're
still incapable

02:38.910 --> 02:41.204
of turning hot water
and coffee grounds
into a palatable beverage.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.500
Liv, relax.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.210
I'd know if I turned
into a zombie.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.837
- I didn't.
- We got lucky.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.257
That's not how I remember it.

02:52.465 --> 02:55.009
I'll rephrase.
We dodged a bullet.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.302
Mmm.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.346
You know what I keep
asking myself?

02:58.513 --> 03:01.015
Why, why didn't the Seahawks
just give the ball
to Marshawn?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.268
How stupid must we be?

03:03.476 --> 03:05.436
Unless there's a cure,
we have no future as a couple.

03:07.147 --> 03:09.566
- You're sure about that?
- Well, think about it.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.901
You've always wanted kids.
That could never happen.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.778
No sex.

03:13.987 --> 03:16.197
Clearly you're
not ready to write that off.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.741
I seem to recall
a couple items on the menu

03:18.950 --> 03:20.535
that don't involve
the exchange of fluids.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.954
I could be holding your arm,
walking down an icy sidewalk.

03:23.163 --> 03:26.416
I slip, I reach out for you,
I scratch you, instant zombie.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.836
So far, to me, it sounds like

03:30.044 --> 03:32.881
all of our problems could be
solved with condoms
and rock salt.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.049
But you came
over here because you needed
help.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.135
We were best friends.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.762
Let's be that again.

03:41.723 --> 03:44.100
It's Ravi. We've got
a body. Sorry.

03:45.727 --> 03:48.646
I'll check in with you later.
Okay? Friends.

03:50.356 --> 03:51.441
Friends.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.159
Mike Hayden,
night security guard.

04:02.577 --> 04:03.912
Shot through the heart.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.038
And who's to blame?

04:06.206 --> 04:07.165
No Bon Jovi fans here.

04:08.666 --> 04:12.086
After hours visitor log,
last page torn out.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.756
Security cameras
were turned
off just before the murder.

04:14.964 --> 04:16.424
It's
a password-protected system.

04:16.633 --> 04:19.344
- Only one person could've
accessed it last night.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.179
- Our victim.
- So, what?

04:21.387 --> 04:24.182
He turned the cameras
off, so his killer
couldn't be identified?

04:24.390 --> 04:27.060
Think of how easy it would be
if there was a video footage.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.229
And the killer could've been
wearing a T-shirt

04:29.437 --> 04:31.272
that inexplicably had
his name and address
written across his chest.

04:31.481 --> 04:33.358
And the address was, like,
right next to the police station.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.693
And the killer's just waiting
calmly, already handcuffed,

04:35.902 --> 04:38.154
just, sort of, reciting
his Miranda rights to himself.

04:38.363 --> 04:43.534
- That would be so great!
Now what're we going to do?

04:43.743 --> 04:45.745
Guess we earn our paychecks.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.872
My mom always wanted
things just so.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.625
- The right flowers,
the right stationary...
- Relax.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.087
Every single detail
will be up to your mother's
exacting standards.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.593
My undertaker.

05:00.802 --> 05:03.304
He's Finnish.

05:03.513 --> 05:04.639
If you'll excuse
me for a moment.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.019
We have
an employee's entrance.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.023
I'll cut the Utopium for you

05:14.232 --> 05:15.566
the same way
I cut it for the boat party,

05:15.775 --> 05:18.319
but I want the cure
you said it would lead to.

05:18.528 --> 05:22.991
- God gives me strength,
I won't eat brains.
- Corinthians?

05:23.199 --> 05:25.785
Never mind. Don't care.
Walk this way.

05:27.829 --> 05:29.580
Night watchman brain.

05:29.789 --> 05:31.582
Wonder what fresh hell
this is going to be.

05:31.791 --> 05:34.585
In cricket, a night watchman
is a lower-order batsman

05:34.794 --> 05:36.212
moved up in an effort
to maintain the strike

05:36.421 --> 05:37.755
till the end...

05:37.964 --> 05:39.632
Funny girl.

05:39.841 --> 05:42.719
So, we have Unis
identifying and interviewing

05:42.927 --> 05:44.637
everyone who appeared
in the security footage

05:44.846 --> 05:46.723
before Mike
turned the cameras off.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.933
We've got three people
who came in last night

05:49.142 --> 05:51.894
who don't seem
to work in the building,
who no one can ID.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.563
Thought we might get
lucky with your third eye.

05:59.277 --> 06:01.446
Sure.

06:05.742 --> 06:06.743
Nope.

06:12.749 --> 06:13.708
Nope.

06:15.293 --> 06:16.294
Hmm.

06:19.130 --> 06:20.840
Nope.

06:21.049 --> 06:23.051
Sorry, my third eye
is a little unfocused.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.178
I skipped breakfast.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.638
All right. Let me know
if you get anything.

06:27.847 --> 06:28.890
Will do.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.489
Mmm.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.616
Oh, my God.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.327
Nothing more primal
than a zombie craving brains.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.170
It's like watching my mother
try to refold a map.

07:01.089 --> 07:03.674
The cane is right there.
It's right there!

07:03.883 --> 07:05.426
This is what I'm telling you.

07:05.635 --> 07:08.388
This is as far as I can go
with these mindless shamblers.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.057
Now, if we're going to make
any real headway
with the Super Max recipe,

07:11.265 --> 07:16.771
we need the DNA
of a coherent, intelligent,
functional zombie.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.898
You live
with a functional zombie.

07:19.107 --> 07:20.900
Can you get
me some of her blood?

07:21.109 --> 07:23.361
Are you thinking
she keeps a vial
of it in her makeup drawer,

07:23.569 --> 07:26.114
or are you expecting
me to shiv her?

07:26.322 --> 07:28.324
A drop will suffice.
However you think best.

07:31.077 --> 07:34.455
We've got
a zombie exterminator
working for us.

07:34.664 --> 07:37.959
Why don't I just ask
him to bring us some?

07:38.167 --> 07:40.420
Whichever puts the sample
in my hand first.

07:46.759 --> 07:49.512
I'm sorry, Mrs. Suzuki.
I didn't mean to imply...

07:50.888 --> 07:51.848
Hello?

07:54.225 --> 07:55.810
Came to take another look
at those photos.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.854
Clear eyes, full stomachs,
can't lose.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.568
I think I just did
something stupid.

08:03.776 --> 08:04.902
Yeah?

08:05.111 --> 08:07.238
I called Suzuki's widow.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.699
Asked if her hero husband
might've been suicidal,
when he shot up Meat Cute.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.286
Whatever.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.746
Any luck?

08:15.955 --> 08:17.081
Still bubkis.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.793
You're a Knicks fan?

08:21.002 --> 08:23.921
Yes. I've had this mug
as long as you've
known me.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.256
You're just now realizing
I'm a fan?

08:25.465 --> 08:27.592
I'm just impressed
you broadcast it.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.220
Nice job using
your lottery pick this year
on Kristaps Porzingis.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.473
Darko Milicic.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.641
We're really talking
basketball now?

08:35.850 --> 08:38.144
I caught you trying to put
paperclips in here a couple
of weeks ago.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.813
You thought
it was for knick knacks.

08:41.022 --> 08:42.648
And Porzingis
is built for the triangle.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.359
Yeah, implementing
that motion offense
with Carmelo,

08:45.526 --> 08:47.612
the biggest ball-stopper
in the league on your team,

08:47.820 --> 08:49.238
what could go wrong?

08:51.115 --> 08:52.450
Can I help you fellas?

08:52.658 --> 08:54.619
Are you investigating
Mike Hayden's murder?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.287
We are.
What can we do for you?

08:56.496 --> 08:57.788
He was our basketball coach.

08:57.997 --> 09:00.291
Basketball coach.
That makes sense.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.459
We think we know
who killed him.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.802
Mr. Hayden was your coach?

09:12.011 --> 09:15.181
Past three years.
He was the best.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.390
Who do you think killed him?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.351
RJ's meathead dad.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.437
- Is one of you RJ?
- RJ quit a few weeks ago,

09:21.646 --> 09:24.023
after his dad
tried to choke Coach.

09:24.232 --> 09:27.026
Who chokes someone
at basketball practice?

09:27.235 --> 09:28.611
Well, Latrell Sprewell does.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.363
- A Knick, wasn't he?
- Not at the time.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.908
So?
You guys going to arrest
this dude or what?

09:34.116 --> 09:35.535
Hey,
we'll talk to RJ's dad.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.161
Does Washington have
the death penalty?

09:38.496 --> 09:39.830
- It does.
- Good.

09:45.545 --> 09:47.922
Hi-ya!

09:48.130 --> 09:49.632
You got to point your heel
at the target.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.842
Pivot on the ball
of your foot.

09:52.051 --> 09:53.344
- Who the hell are you?
- TJ Ryan?

09:54.053 --> 09:55.596
Seattle P.D.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.390
We're investigating
the murder of Mike Hayden,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.225
your son's former
basketball coach.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.310
RJ's off getting spoiled
by his mom.

10:01.519 --> 10:02.645
I've got
him every second weekend.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.815
We're here to talk
to you, actually.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.775
Thought maybe
you could explain
why you choked Mr. Hayden.

10:10.069 --> 10:12.029
Who told you I choked him?

10:12.238 --> 10:14.782
Was it that fairy, what's
his face, from Child
Protective Services?

10:14.991 --> 10:17.076
Was it? Huh? Was it?

10:17.285 --> 10:19.579
You got something to say
about the way I raise my kid,
you say it to me!

10:20.871 --> 10:22.957
Or was it my kid?

10:23.165 --> 10:25.501
Because that mama's boy
needs a serious lesson
in keeping his mouth shut.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.086
Hey, blondie,
I asked you a question.

10:30.381 --> 10:32.133
When I talk, you listen.
You hear me?

10:36.053 --> 10:39.098
- Don't ignore me, woman.
- Step back, sir.

10:39.307 --> 10:42.101
Can you tell me where you were
last night at midnight?

10:42.310 --> 10:43.769
The Public Library.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.396
My whole softball team
was with me.

10:45.605 --> 10:47.231
Right. You and the boys
were hosting a discussion

10:47.440 --> 10:48.983
of the latest Danielle
Steele novel.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.110
It's a tavern on Fourth.

10:51.319 --> 10:53.029
Okay, that's
easier to imagine.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.073
I'm going to need
a list of teammates.

10:59.994 --> 11:01.621
- The choking incident.
- Yeah?

11:01.829 --> 11:03.289
It wasn't over playing time.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.334
Coach Mike reported TJ
to Child Protective Services.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.420
- I'll see if they can
tell us, why.
- No need, I saw that too.

11:09.629 --> 11:11.172
He hits his kid, Clive.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.591
I'm afraid that's
the kind of lesson
he has in store for RJ.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.476
All right, well,

11:23.684 --> 11:24.810
if you're feeling
frisky, we can always ramp
it up on the treadmill.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.480
Lord, that Rita.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.608
That girl is a walking
visit from H.R.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.029
Why don't you go
ahead and get changed?
I'll set up.

11:41.035 --> 11:43.371
Good news is you're not dead.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.832
Bad news is you have to come
up with some other excuse
for not responding to my text.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.585
Yeah, well, I didn't get
it until this morning.

11:49.794 --> 11:51.671
But it did make
my heart flutter.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.965
"U up?"
You stole my heart
in those three characters.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.885
Whatever.

11:58.094 --> 12:00.096
You have to earn
me spelling out words
in their entirety.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.476
So, how many zombie
removals can I put
you down for this week?

12:07.311 --> 12:08.938
I don't know.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.231
How many people
are you going
to murder this week?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.359
Not people.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.695
Zombies.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.114
How about we shoot for two?

12:20.157 --> 12:22.034
Go big or go home, I say.

12:22.243 --> 12:25.037
No, I'm not doing
any, until I get
a more potent tranquilizer.

12:25.246 --> 12:27.039
All right? The last guy
woke up in my trunk.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.749
Well, they can't
all go smoothly.

12:28.958 --> 12:29.875
Where's the fun in that?

12:32.753 --> 12:33.963
Fine.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.382
Let me see what I can do.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.676
Swing by my office
when you're done here.

12:43.389 --> 12:44.974
Zombie killer.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.267
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>

12:46.475 --> 12:47.560
You get what I need?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.061
Is this him?

12:49.270 --> 12:52.398
Indeed it is. Major, this is
our head of R&D.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.734
As far as you know,
her name is Dr. Erving.

12:54.942 --> 12:59.029
Then, as far as I know,
can her first name be Julius?

12:59.238 --> 13:00.906
I was told you needed
a stronger sedative,

13:01.115 --> 13:03.409
but I'm afraid I need
a few more details.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.827
In what way did it fail?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.746
I understand
the zombie was disposed of.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.665
He woke up in my trunk,
on the way
to being disposed of.

13:09.874 --> 13:13.002
- How do you know he woke up?
- He started begging
for me to spare his life.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.714
Hmm! Remarkable. And was
he intelligible?
Or was it more like moaning?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.048
More like a...

13:18.257 --> 13:19.884
He said,
"Please don't kill me."

13:20.092 --> 13:22.094
He told me that he cares
for his aging parents,
and they need him.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.388
And when he became
convinced he wasn't going
to survive the night,

13:24.597 --> 13:26.432
he asked me to take
care of his dog.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.893
Well, I'm surprised he was
so lucid.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.604
Yeah. Me, too.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.245
What the hell, Lilywhite?

13:48.454 --> 13:51.165
It's 7:45 p.m. Are you 90?

13:51.373 --> 13:54.126
Rough day is all.

13:54.335 --> 13:57.922
I'm going to remind
you of something, son,
something you already know.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.300
The world ain't all Dilly Bars
and debutante balls.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.511
The world throws
wicked punches.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.346
It wants to see
who goes down easy.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.264
Some people
stay on the mat.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.142
Not you, though.

14:10.351 --> 14:14.396
You were
an undersized walk-on
free safety at U-Dub.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.607
Three years
later you were a starter.

14:16.816 --> 14:19.860
It takes a tough,
get-back-off-the-mat
son-of-a-bitch to do that.

14:20.069 --> 14:21.570
But that ain't
what impressed me.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.739
I fell in love with the guy

14:23.948 --> 14:26.492
who could've cashed
in on his looks, his
connections, his notoriety,

14:26.700 --> 14:30.663
but instead, he said,
"I've been blessed,
and I want to give back.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.540
"I'm going to be
a social worker.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.751
"I'm going to be the guy
who helps others get back up."

14:37.586 --> 14:40.172
I know you've taken
some haymakers lately.

14:40.381 --> 14:44.134
I know that this time it's
harder to get
back up than it's ever been.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.179
But you're Major
mother-flipping Lilywhite,
and you don't quit.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.807
God, you're so weird.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.520
Open a window,
it reeks in here.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.815
Shower, for God's sakes,
and clean this mess up.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.360
And, Lilywhite, there still
any Utopium in here?

15:01.569 --> 15:03.696
The answer better be,
"Not in my house."

15:04.572 --> 15:05.823
There's not.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.325
Not in my house.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.327
- Speak up, son!
- Not in my house.

15:11.996 --> 15:13.038
Good.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.292
I'll meet you downstairs
when you're done.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.710
We can watch <i>Hoosiers.</i>

15:17.918 --> 15:19.712
After all these years?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.964
You've always refused before.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.258
Well, back then, I was worried
that seeing you cry
over fictional sports

15:24.466 --> 15:27.428
would adversely affect
my sexual desire for you.

15:27.595 --> 15:30.389
But that's
not an issue
anymore, friend.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.865
- Your tire's on my lawn, man.
- Bill me.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.700
What're you doing here?
I know my alibi checked out.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.952
- Yeah, it did.
- Then what?

15:52.161 --> 15:54.914
Just a warning. I talked
to your son's homeroom
teacher, gave her my card,

15:55.122 --> 15:58.000
told her to call me if RJ
had any accidents, or falls,

15:59.335 --> 16:01.420
if the part in his hair
looked crooked.

16:01.629 --> 16:02.922
You've got some balls, man.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.006
Showing up at my house,

16:04.214 --> 16:05.549
telling me how to raise
my kid.

16:05.758 --> 16:07.635
So how about you get
back in your car...

16:07.843 --> 16:08.761
Argh!

16:15.017 --> 16:16.435
Don't ever put your hands
on your son again.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.912
- Hey, Cavanaugh,
what's Funders Keepers?
- No clue.

16:36.789 --> 16:37.748
Babineaux.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.084
A word.

16:49.969 --> 16:50.928
You know why you're in here?

16:54.139 --> 16:55.849
Yeah.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.893
And I know
I shouldn't have
done it, but...

16:58.102 --> 17:01.647
If you know,
then why am I getting calls
from grieving widows?

17:01.855 --> 17:07.361
Please, tell me you did not
imply to Suzuki's wife
that her husband shot himself.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.321
Well, there are
still some things
about that case

17:09.530 --> 17:10.739
that don't add up.

17:10.948 --> 17:13.325
Who asked
you to add
anything up?

17:13.534 --> 17:17.830
What I do remember is
assigning you to the security
guard homicide.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.289
And I'm on it, Lieutenant.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.500
It's just,

17:21.709 --> 17:23.335
the forensic evidence
at Meat Cute

17:23.544 --> 17:26.547
suggests there was
at least one other shooter.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.173
And we never found
this Blaine.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.967
I'm familiar with the case,
Clive.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.593
I'm the one who pulled
you off!

17:37.850 --> 17:39.727
Is something funny?

17:41.478 --> 17:42.563
I'm sorry.

17:42.730 --> 17:44.314
Cavanaugh sent me this Vine.

17:45.858 --> 17:46.984
A cat walking on two legs.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.530
Yeah.

17:51.739 --> 17:53.032
I'll give you this,

17:53.240 --> 17:54.908
you're taking
this friends thing seriously.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.702
I thought the friendship offer
was just something girls say

17:56.910 --> 17:57.953
when they don't want
to see you naked.

17:58.162 --> 17:59.580
Like you've heard
a lot of that?

17:59.788 --> 18:01.206
No, but I've read about it.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.542
Seriously, though,
<i>Hoosiers</i> last night,

18:03.751 --> 18:05.377
playing hoops today,
what're we going to do
tomorrow?

18:05.586 --> 18:07.463
We should eat
some chicken wings,

18:07.671 --> 18:09.006
maybe talk about whether or not
the movie <i>Casino</i> was any good?

18:09.214 --> 18:10.382
You may be busy tomorrow.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.639
Liv, what are we doing here?

18:17.848 --> 18:20.893
You mean,
with this ragtag group
of disadvantaged kids

18:21.101 --> 18:23.812
who tragically lost
their coach a few days ago?

18:24.021 --> 18:26.315
Did I forget to mention
they'd be here?

18:26.523 --> 18:28.192
Okay, I see
what you're trying to do.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.651
Well, I'm not being subtle.

18:29.860 --> 18:30.778
Is this the guy?

18:34.448 --> 18:35.449
Well?

18:42.706 --> 18:43.874
Keep your head up, Jaylen.

18:45.084 --> 18:46.418
Nice pass.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.212
Move your feet, Joey!

18:48.420 --> 18:52.049
This is basketball,
not bullfighting.
Come on, pick it up now!

18:52.257 --> 18:54.676
- Okay, Johnny,
find the open man!
Back-screen!

18:54.885 --> 18:56.804
If they overplay,
make 'em pay!

18:57.012 --> 19:00.015
Come on, fellas,
show us something!

19:00.224 --> 19:01.600
Hey, watch
the elbows, Charlie.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.937
That kid's got edge, Maje.
He could play for me.

19:05.145 --> 19:09.191
I'm beginning to think
that your ulterior motive
has an ulterior motive.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.276
What?

19:11.485 --> 19:13.153
See the cutter! Box out!

19:13.362 --> 19:15.280
Hey, hey, break it up! Whoa!

19:15.489 --> 19:18.617
Hey! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, hey!

19:18.826 --> 19:21.620
Is that the kind of team
this is. Huh?

19:21.829 --> 19:23.330
The kind of team Coach Hayden
would want you to be?

19:24.206 --> 19:25.124
No.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.750
Wow. You went there.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.211
I'm shameless.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.339
Look, Charlie,
keep your elbows down.

19:32.548 --> 19:35.384
- Jordy, stop head-butting
Charlie's elbows.

19:36.927 --> 19:37.928
All right.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.476
Puncture wound,
six centimeters
under left anterior rib cage,

19:44.685 --> 19:46.019
piercing the ascending colon.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.479
- The victim was...
- Yo.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.316
You Ravi?

19:51.525 --> 19:54.570
I know you.
Uh, how do I know you?

19:54.778 --> 19:58.907
You may recognize
me from such autopsies
as my twin brother's.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.076
Oh, yes.

20:01.285 --> 20:02.786
Scott Eberhard
was your brother.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.165
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Uh-uh. He was nuts.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.792
Dude believed in zombies.

20:09.001 --> 20:12.379
Boat party Utopium,
courtesy of your friends
over at Shady Plots.

20:12.588 --> 20:13.797
Blaine says you'll know
what to do with it.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.384
He's gonna need that cure
<i>muy pronto.</i>

20:25.517 --> 20:27.269
Hey. What's cooking?

20:27.477 --> 20:30.022
Just grilling some veggies.
Help yourself.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.024
Haven't seen you in a while.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.276
Yeah, work's been a gong show.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.153
Yeah?

20:36.361 --> 20:38.655
- Wait till tax season.
That must be a bear.

20:38.864 --> 20:42.701
Whatever happened
to Magic Mike,
that super-hot guy you hired?

20:42.910 --> 20:46.079
Let's just say he's done
some quality work
underneath me.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.917
You made it happen.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.752
So, those nights
you didn't come home...

20:51.960 --> 20:53.462
I'm loud.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.214
Seriously, I sound
like a cartoon character
being murdered.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.381
I wouldn't want
to put you through it.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.675
And what about you?

20:58.884 --> 21:00.302
It's like a convent
up in here.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.180
You missed it, there was
full on no-holds-barred

21:03.388 --> 21:05.224
kissing in here a couple
nights ago.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.560
- Tongues and everything.
- Who is this porn star?

21:08.769 --> 21:09.895
My ex-fiance.

21:12.481 --> 21:13.523
Really?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.692
Yeah.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.737
- You think you're shocked.
I was just...
- Ahhh!

21:18.946 --> 21:20.656
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

21:20.864 --> 21:23.242
I'm fine. Just a flesh wound.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.244
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a klutz.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.704
- You must've really had
it in for that zucchini.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.873
Let me take that.

21:30.082 --> 21:33.210
I'm fine. I'm just going
to wash this and get
a Band-Aid.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.378
All right.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.971
There's an open wine
in the fridge.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.181
That's okay.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.391
I've got
everything I need.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.532
This is all tainted Utopium?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.951
From Blaine and his friends
at Shady Plots.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.703
A group
that evidently includes

22:07.911 --> 22:10.289
the twin brother
of one Scott Eberhard.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.957
Does he talk
to the devil, too?

22:12.165 --> 22:14.209
Only this handsome one
during our brief interaction.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.169
As far as I could tell.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.462
How many zombie cures
do you think we can
get out of this?

22:17.671 --> 22:19.631
No, no, no, not so fast.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.675
First, we need
to make zombie rats to test
whether or not

22:21.883 --> 22:24.261
this Utopium can truly lead
to a zombie cure.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.680
And we are talking
months of rigorous testing.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.056
Who knows how Blaine
got his hands on this.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.225
I could be with Major.

22:30.434 --> 22:31.810
Hey, you are
hearing me, right?

22:32.019 --> 22:33.478
Just say it with me.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.647
"Rigorous testing."
"Months."

22:35.856 --> 22:37.649
Months for lesser men, maybe,

22:37.858 --> 22:39.985
but not for the Einstein
of zombie kind,

22:40.193 --> 22:42.070
the egghead from West End.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.947
I'm from Upton Park, actually.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.490
And Broadway Joe
was from Beaver Falls.
The point is...

22:45.699 --> 22:48.618
You ever heard
of Funders Keepers?

22:48.827 --> 22:51.121
It's a crowd funding site.
Why?

22:51.330 --> 22:55.500
So Coach Hayden was raising
$5,000 to take his team to
Steve Nash's basketball camp.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.044
- Aw!
- Huh!

22:57.252 --> 22:59.129
In the project's
first three weeks online,

22:59.338 --> 23:01.673
Mike raised less than $1,000.

23:01.882 --> 23:06.011
But then, a single, anonymous,
$4,100 pledge on the final day
put him over the top.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.514
- On the day he died.
- That can't be a coincidence.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.642
All right, bring it out.
Give them options, guys.
Drive it!

23:12.851 --> 23:14.102
Take it in...

23:14.311 --> 23:16.688
Oh! Nice shot, Chris!
Go ahead, admire it.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.357
Jaylen, you gonna
let him do
you like that?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.524
Go get it back, now.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.526
Looking good, coach.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.987
But, have
you considered
a read-and-react offense

23:24.196 --> 23:25.989
with some high-screen sets
and more movement
off the ball?

23:26.198 --> 23:28.367
- I mean...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

23:28.575 --> 23:31.370
Break it up! Break it up!
Oh, hey, break it up!

23:31.578 --> 23:33.580
Cool off, Charlie,
go get some water.

23:33.789 --> 23:36.333
I'll talk to you in a minute.
Go.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.382
Look, I gotta talk to Charlie.
You mind taking over practice?

23:43.590 --> 23:44.674
I thought you'd never ask.

23:56.186 --> 23:57.104
Huddle up!

23:59.231 --> 24:03.026
Here's what's gonna
happen, gentlemen,
you're gonna pick it up.

24:03.235 --> 24:08.615
I want to see ball movement,
proper screens,
hard cuts to the hole.

24:08.824 --> 24:11.451
And if I don't,

24:11.660 --> 24:14.746
- I'm going to run you
like dogs.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.087
Let's go, ladies! Hustle!

24:22.295 --> 24:26.049
I tried to warn
you, you want to dance,
you got to pay the band.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.055
Water break. Back in five.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.224
Hey, do it tomorrow, yeah? Go.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.476
- How'd it go?
- Ah...

24:36.685 --> 24:38.979
Trouble at home.
He's in a bad place.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.605
Jordy said
Charlie's dad split.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.567
Ran off to Tucson
with their babysitter.

24:43.775 --> 24:46.611
Gone,
completely out of his life,
just like that.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.572
Yeah, that'll mess you up.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.625
Excuse me, are you all done
with the sports section?

25:00.834 --> 25:01.751
All yours.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.509
Thanks.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.142
- Daddy!
- Hey!

25:18.351 --> 25:20.187
Come here you.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.773
Just look at you.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.609
Huh?

25:27.569 --> 25:31.531
Okay, I understand
that Bitcoin is untraceable,

25:31.740 --> 25:32.949
but there must be...

25:34.743 --> 25:36.536
I know what untraceable means.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.122
Thanks anyway.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.631
I noticed you were
the first detective of record
on the Meat Cute case,

25:47.839 --> 25:49.799
but got pulled off. Why?

25:55.889 --> 25:59.684
There was a story they liked
that was neat and tidy

25:59.893 --> 26:01.478
and made a hero
out of one of our own.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.522
Then there was a
messier story,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.774
one that still hasn't
been solved,

26:05.982 --> 26:08.235
but I doubt it would get
any police heroism headlines.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.197
And that's the theory
you advanced?

26:16.284 --> 26:19.621
Here's
something that would
really untidy their story.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.831
Remember Alan York?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.543
Fourth man on the Moon,
came through Seattle
on a book tour last year,

26:24.751 --> 26:27.170
disappeared without a trace?

26:27.379 --> 26:30.590
- What about him?
- We found a strand of his hair
deep in a sink drain.

26:32.259 --> 26:33.218
At Meat Cute.

26:45.689 --> 26:50.193
As the ranking zombie on-site,
shouldn't I get veto-power
over their names?

26:50.402 --> 26:52.821
I'm kind of over your whole
<i>Star Wars</i> theme.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.490
Why don't we name these guys
after the '86 Celtics?

26:55.699 --> 26:57.200
As in Celtic F.C.,
from Glasgow?

26:57.409 --> 26:58.827
As in Boston Celtics.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.663
Bird. McHale. Parrish.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.331
Then, no.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.708
I don't have the foggiest idea
who those people are,

27:04.916 --> 27:07.127
and neither will
you in a few days.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.504
We'll just be standing
here trying to remember
why we're calling a rat Bird.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.673
Isn't that right, Boba Ratt?

27:11.881 --> 27:13.883
Again with the rats, you two.

27:14.092 --> 27:17.721
So, that $4,000 donation
to Mike's Funders Keepers
page is a dead end.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.431
Whoever made it used Bitcoin.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.640
Untraceable, apparently.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.477
Babineaux.

27:25.979 --> 27:28.315
Okay. Where's the body?
Got it. Thanks.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.862
New lead. Remember
the pictures I showed
you from the security footage,

27:34.070 --> 27:35.363
the three people
we couldn't identify?

27:35.572 --> 27:36.531
Mmm-hmm.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.783
One just turned up dead.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.703
- You guys up for a field trip?
- We're already in a morgue.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.622
I vote we wait for a body
to come to us.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.624
We can't.
He was found in Tacoma.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.001
Oh, bloody hell.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.758
See? Our drawers
are refrigerated,
just like in the big city.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.927
I know.
Your whole set up is so cozy.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.180
No wasted space.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.266
Yes, well.

28:03.475 --> 28:07.896
In Tacoma, they have
a real stigma against murder,
so we find this space ample.

28:08.104 --> 28:11.650
- Guys, Ian...
- Dr. Metzger.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.443
Right.

28:13.652 --> 28:16.988
Dr. Metzger and I met
at the interview
for my current position.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.074
- Quotas.
- Yes.

28:19.282 --> 28:22.285
Seattle insists
a percentage of their hires be

28:22.494 --> 28:24.371
respected experts
in their field.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.499
A foreign accent must come
in handy, when selling
yourself as one.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.710
Dr. Metzger, when we spoke
on the phone,
you weren't positive that...

28:30.919 --> 28:34.881
Yes, dental records confirm
this is Telly Levins. 48.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.217
Body was found
in the concrete foundation

28:37.425 --> 28:39.302
of a high rise
construction site.

28:39.511 --> 28:42.889
So you have high rises
here in the Shire?

28:43.098 --> 28:46.267
- Cranes. Bulldozers.
The whole nine yards.
Oh.

28:46.476 --> 28:50.230
And the citizenry doesn't
suspect witchcraft? Hmm.

28:53.525 --> 28:56.569
This was found on Levins.
Now.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.488
I believe he was
working on the site,

28:58.697 --> 29:01.032
fell, hit his head
on the cross beam and then.

29:03.618 --> 29:08.081
- Then, sunk
into the wet concrete.
- Ah...

29:08.289 --> 29:11.459
There are traces
of cerebrospinal fluid
in his ears and nose.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.129
Yeah, this fracture was caused
by acute, blunt force trauma.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.338
Somebody did this to him.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.257
Blunt force trauma?

29:18.925 --> 29:21.136
Like hitting a crossbeam
and falling into a pit?

29:21.344 --> 29:22.804
There was no sign of struggle.

29:23.012 --> 29:25.140
- Occam's Razor, my friend.
- Um...

29:25.348 --> 29:28.768
Maybe there was no struggle
because he was
caught by surprise.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.273
Construction site?

29:33.440 --> 29:34.983
Man with a hammer?

29:35.191 --> 29:36.985
Let's not make
it more complicated
than it is.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.820
Levins has
a lengthy rap sheet.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.822
Mostly as a low-level
collections guy,

29:41.030 --> 29:43.867
an enforcer for
a few different
bookmaking operations.

29:44.075 --> 29:47.954
Huh? So that hammer would
come in handy for breaking
kneecaps.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.248
It's what people
in his line of work do.

29:54.002 --> 29:56.337
I stand
corrected.

29:56.546 --> 29:59.966
The security tapes show Telly
going to the 14th floor
an hour before Mike was shot.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.302
Who occupies the 14th floor?

30:02.510 --> 30:05.430
A law office, heavy hitters
representing some of Seattle's
shadiest clients.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.308
Telly was never seen on tape
leaving the building.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.143
He ends up dead
and dumped in Tacoma.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.228
Who else was
on the 14th floor?

30:12.437 --> 30:14.230
The tapes showed
only one other person
going up there that night

30:14.439 --> 30:16.357
before the cameras
were turned off.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.526
- That's who we need
to talk to.
- Got it.

30:18.735 --> 30:19.819
It's a real shame
about Mike.

30:22.197 --> 30:25.909
But I can assure you, he was
very much alive when I left
the building.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.786
What brought
you in so late, Mr. Thrunk?

30:27.994 --> 30:29.370
I'd forgotten a file I needed.

30:29.579 --> 30:32.582
Did he talk
to you about his Funders
Keepers project?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.292
He talked
to everyone about it.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.628
- He was a broken record
on the topic.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.547
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thrunk,
I entered the wrong code
into the photocopier,

30:39.756 --> 30:41.966
and the entire Helms case
was billed to Mr. Powell.

30:42.175 --> 30:43.843
Go see Rick in accounting.
He'll take care of it.

30:46.304 --> 30:50.892
The ability to handle
one's own problems,
a lost art.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.352
Do you recognize this man?

30:53.603 --> 30:55.730
Nope.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.733
Do you remember
who else was up here
on the 14th floor that night?

30:58.942 --> 31:01.903
There's usually a few people
working late, but I wasn't
paying attention.

31:04.697 --> 31:05.657
Thank you.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.289
Does everyone have
their own code for the copier?

31:14.415 --> 31:15.792
They do, why?

31:24.259 --> 31:25.802
Hello? Can I help you?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.011
Harry Cole?

31:28.012 --> 31:29.764
Seattle P.D.

31:29.973 --> 31:32.767
Your copier code was
among those logged
on Thursday night.

31:32.976 --> 31:35.728
The night Mike Hayden,
the lobby security guard
was killed.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.188
Were you working
late that night?

31:37.397 --> 31:38.731
I was.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.066
I have a big case coming up.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.945
Appears you're
a big sports fan, Mr. Cole.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.530
Ever do any gambling?

31:45.738 --> 31:47.657
Well... A few bucks
for the Super Bowl.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.367
Have you ever met
Telly Levins?

31:52.704 --> 31:53.746
Uh-uh. No.

32:01.629 --> 32:04.465
<i>Come on, Hearst! Defense!</i>

32:04.674 --> 32:05.633
<i>No!</i>

32:08.845 --> 32:10.722
Sorry, I can't be
of more help.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.891
Did you go to Hearst College?

32:13.099 --> 32:15.685
No. I really wish there was
something more I could
offer, but, uh...

32:15.894 --> 32:17.604
We've had access
to Mike's email.

32:17.812 --> 32:19.439
He mentioned you having
a breakdown in the lobby

32:19.647 --> 32:21.399
following a Hearst College
loss.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.192
I have no memory of that.

32:24.861 --> 32:28.239
Wow, signed by Pete Rose.
The hit king!

32:28.448 --> 32:30.617
- You mind?
- Help yourself, man.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.124
Is that bleach?

32:42.670 --> 32:45.214
Is this about where you were
standing when Telly Levins
came by

32:45.423 --> 32:48.509
- to collect
on your gambling debts?

32:48.718 --> 32:51.471
Like I said,
I don't know a Telly.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.973
Did he threaten
you with a ball-peen hammer?

32:54.182 --> 32:57.185
- "Pay up or lose a kneecap."
You didn't have
the money.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.395
But you did have a bat
within reach.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.402
This is all conjecture.

33:15.787 --> 33:19.499
It's going to stop being
conjecture when this turns
out to be Telly Levins' blood.

33:22.293 --> 33:23.252
Yes.

33:24.629 --> 33:26.130
All right, friends.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.883
What we have here is a
concentrated dose of Max Rager

33:29.092 --> 33:31.386
and what we hope is
Boat Party Utopium.

33:31.594 --> 33:35.932
If it's indeed the right stuff
you will soon be
zombie rats.

33:36.140 --> 33:40.144
Your courage will be
neither forgotten,
nor in vain.

33:40.353 --> 33:42.939
Who goes first?
Do I have a volunteer?

33:43.147 --> 33:48.361
<i>I don't care
if Monday's blue, Tuesday's
gray and Wednesday too</i>

33:48.569 --> 33:53.574
<i>Thursday I don't care
about you
It's Friday I'm in love</i>

33:53.783 --> 33:55.410
To what do I owe the pleasure?

33:55.618 --> 33:56.911
Come on. The Cure?

33:58.871 --> 34:00.415
I don't know why I bother.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.291
The cure won't
be ready for a while, yet.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.086
We're going to do
this properly this time.
Rigorous testing.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.088
Sorry, Doc.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.048
I promised my friend
if he gave
us the tainted Utopium recipe,

34:09.257 --> 34:11.217
he'd get the cure,
<i>tout de suite.</i>

34:11.426 --> 34:13.302
For your friend?

34:13.511 --> 34:17.056
- Come Holy Spirit, fill
the hearts of your faithful...
- No! Wait!

34:18.599 --> 34:22.979
Kindle in them
the fire of your love.

34:23.938 --> 34:24.939
That was unwise.

34:46.753 --> 34:47.795
Needs work, Doc.

34:54.510 --> 34:58.264
I'm calling it.
Time of death, 9:47 p.m.

34:58.473 --> 34:59.515
Drug overdose.

34:59.724 --> 35:00.850
This job isn't so hard.

35:01.059 --> 35:02.643
That wasn't the cure.

35:02.852 --> 35:05.104
That was
the tainted Utopium
Max Rager combination

35:05.313 --> 35:08.816
I was going to use to make
the zombie rat test subjects.

35:09.025 --> 35:13.071
This certainly means that
so-called Boat Party Utopium
wasn't even close.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.447
We are back to square one.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.116
Bright side?

35:17.325 --> 35:19.702
You discovered the anti-cure.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.496
Instant zombie killer.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.289
So I wouldn't beat
yourself up too much, Doc.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.249
That's a hell of an
accomplishment unto itself.

35:26.584 --> 35:27.710
I mean, in the wrong hands...

36:27.895 --> 36:31.023
Well, that's my cardio
for the day.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.281
Let me tell
you what it looks like, Harry.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.200
You have a gambling problem.

36:41.409 --> 36:42.869
Racked up debts
you couldn't pay.

36:43.077 --> 36:45.496
Telly was sent
to break some bones,
or worse.

36:45.705 --> 36:47.790
But Telly brought a hammer
to a bat fight.

36:47.999 --> 36:50.376
Nice touch, Clive.
You got this.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.253
You thought you could
disappear Telly's body

36:52.461 --> 36:54.463
into a cement foundation
in Tacoma,

36:54.672 --> 36:58.217
but first you had to get
his body past Mike
and the security cameras.

36:58.426 --> 37:01.429
So you called down and made
a deal, if Mike shut down
the cameras,

37:01.637 --> 37:03.097
you'd donate
the rest of the money
he needed

37:03.306 --> 37:05.224
to send his team
to basketball camp.

37:05.433 --> 37:08.436
You tore out the page
of the visitor's log
where Telly signed in.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.563
But you didn't want to leave
anything to chance,

37:10.771 --> 37:12.773
so you figured you'd
better kill Mike, too.

37:12.982 --> 37:15.902
Boom. You got this.
Bring it on home.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.403
Why don't you take a seat,
Miss Moore.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.909
The blood we found
on your office blinds

37:23.117 --> 37:24.660
will come back as a match
for Telly.

37:24.869 --> 37:26.078
Okay, okay. Yeah.

37:29.582 --> 37:32.418
Telly pulled out the hammer
and I just reacted. Okay?

37:32.627 --> 37:34.253
I grabbed my bat.
It was self-defense.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.464
But I didn't kill Mike.

37:40.801 --> 37:46.098
- Then who did?
- We have a guy that works
at our firm, a fixer.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.934
He cleans up messes like this.

37:48.142 --> 37:49.936
He told me to wipe
down the bat,

37:50.144 --> 37:51.771
- and everything else
with bleach.
- But you forgot the blinds.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.731
I was working fast.

37:53.940 --> 37:58.486
- "Be quick, but don't hurry."
John Wooden said that.
- Uh...

37:58.694 --> 38:00.446
Getting Mike to turn
off the security cameras,

38:00.613 --> 38:03.449
the Funders Keepers donation,
that was all his idea.

38:03.658 --> 38:05.785
And then we stuffed
Telly's body
in a janitor's cart,

38:05.993 --> 38:07.078
we wheeled
it down to the lobby.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.705
But he shot Mike.

38:09.914 --> 38:12.291
I swear to God,
I had no idea that was
part of his plan.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.461
You'll testify to that fact?

38:15.628 --> 38:20.800
I mean, if the deal
is right, I'll give
you the name.

38:21.008 --> 38:24.053
Only one guy
at your firm showed
up just before Mike's killing.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.681
I don't need a name.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.021
I checked
out eight potentials
this week.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.147
None were zombies.

38:36.565 --> 38:37.775
You're sure?

38:37.984 --> 38:39.485
- None?
- Yeah.

38:41.988 --> 38:43.781
And

38:43.990 --> 38:46.909
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to mix
business with,

38:47.118 --> 38:49.203
well, whatever it is
we were doing.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.291
We'll play it by ear.

39:03.092 --> 39:04.593
I'm not sure if Vaughn
explained to you

39:04.802 --> 39:07.388
the full extent
of how our list
is generated,

39:07.596 --> 39:09.724
but there are
statistical probabilities
attached to each

39:09.932 --> 39:11.892
of the potential zombies
we've given you.

39:12.101 --> 39:14.770
And the likelihood
of these eight names
all coming back negative is...

39:18.232 --> 39:19.191
low.

39:20.735 --> 39:21.902
Never tell me the odds.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.721
Yes, you are a good boy.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.222
Good boy!

39:54.477 --> 39:56.604
Hey.
Sorry, I knocked, but

39:56.812 --> 39:59.732
no one answered, and this guy
was talking trash,

39:59.940 --> 40:02.193
so I had to let
myself in and show
him who's boss.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.573
There's the Major I remember.

40:09.992 --> 40:12.244
- Are you leaving?
- No.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.373
We're just going
to get a bite.
Pizza, maybe?

40:15.581 --> 40:16.499
What do you feel like?

40:19.043 --> 40:21.253
Liv, I don't want
to do this anymore.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.838
Do what?

40:23.047 --> 40:24.548
Pretend I'm
okay just being your friend.

40:26.342 --> 40:30.012
I want more. I want us to be
together again.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.268
Major, nothing has changed.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.104
- I still...
- I know all the risks,

40:38.312 --> 40:39.522
and all the reasons
it can't work.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.690
But I don't care.

40:41.899 --> 40:43.734
I'm a better man
with you in my life.

40:46.237 --> 40:47.238
Can we give it another shot?

40:50.533 --> 40:52.368
<i>Hey, you've reached
Liv's phone.
Leave a message.</i>

40:53.619 --> 40:55.830
Hey, Liv.

40:56.038 --> 40:59.250
Thought you'd want to know
we found Roger Thrunk
trying to board a private jet.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.501
He's in custody now.

41:01.752 --> 41:02.711
Good work.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.966
Mrs. Suzuki.
I owe you an apology.

41:07.174 --> 41:09.093
- I shouldn't have...
- I don't need an apology.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.387
I thought about what you said
on the phone the other day,
and...

41:12.721 --> 41:14.932
He could've been suicidal.

41:18.269 --> 41:24.024
Anyway, after you called,
I started poking around.

41:24.233 --> 41:25.818
He had a beer fridge,
and I found this

41:28.487 --> 41:29.447
in the freezer.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.616
I don't know
what to make of it.

41:34.618 --> 41:35.494
Maybe you will.
