17:02.322 --> 17:03.654
JEFF:
Sabrina is making our witch

17:03.656 --> 17:05.790
out of rice cereal
treats and fondant.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.291
The witch is the focal
point of this.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.693
Sabrina's gonna be
working on the witch

17:08.695 --> 17:10.528
for most of the time.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.562
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.164
-How are you doing?
-Good.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.499
-Elizabeth, nice to meet you.
-Elizabeth, nice to meet you.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.401
Y'all are both gonna be
working with me today.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.602
After winning the Small Scare,

17:17.604 --> 17:20.071
having that extra
baking assistant is great.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.206
We're gonna solidify
our position in the top

17:22.208 --> 17:25.543
with the fact that we're
trying to defy gravity.

17:25.545 --> 17:30.114
So our concept is a bad witch
steals a ZZ 1,000 broom board,

17:30.116 --> 17:33.418
flying away, and our two pumpkin
police characters chase her.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.153
People want to see
what I'm capable of,

17:35.155 --> 17:36.554
so I'm gonna give it.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.588
KIMBERLY: Lenny is doing
the two police characters

17:37.590 --> 17:39.157
out of pumpkin.

17:39.159 --> 17:43.394
Guys, I finished putting up
my storefront with the fondant,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.329
so now, I'm gonna
start airbrushing it.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.632
KIMBERLY: Shelby is going to
paint the backdrop,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.434
roll fondant for the floor,

17:49.436 --> 17:51.035
and then we're going
to have wanted posters

17:51.037 --> 17:52.703
made out of wafer paper.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.573
I am about to cover
the surfboard.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.910
The broom board is made
with rice cereal and fondant.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.978
Then adding fondant accents,

18:00.980 --> 18:03.114
and then I'm gonna
airbrush a skull,

18:03.116 --> 18:05.149
and the base of the board
is gonna have flames

18:05.151 --> 18:06.517
shooting out the back.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.854
This is one of our simpler
designs but very technical.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.256
We have to get that
witch board up in the air.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.158
Can't wait to see the flames
on this thing.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.628
Going to make our bad
hiker boss witch.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.599
So we're thinking is a witch
that's turned her bat familiar

18:21.601 --> 18:24.068
into this brand-new motorcycle.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.104
We need believable detail.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.139
I'm in charge of making
the pieces for the bike

18:28.141 --> 18:29.674
as well as the entire witch.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.143
The first thing I have to start
working on are the tires

18:32.145 --> 18:34.112
because they've got to set.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.680
Then, I move on
to doing the witch

18:35.682 --> 18:37.682
out of modeling chocolate
and fondant.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.751
Once I have all that detail done
it's time to start painting.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.054
I'm feeling good,
but I'm busier than a dog

18:43.056 --> 18:44.689
at the fire-hydrant factory.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.057
ELIZABETH: Clive will be making
our gas tank

18:46.059 --> 18:47.592
as well as the front of it,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.661
which is going to be the bat
head carved out of pumpkin.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.030
The past challenges,
Clive hasn't been able to get

18:53.032 --> 18:56.067
the pieces done in the time
frame that we need to stick to.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.502
This is crucial for us.

18:57.504 --> 19:01.706
Without this head on our cycle,
I can't put my arms and legs on.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.074
Am I in danger?

19:03.076 --> 19:04.842
No. Never.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.244
ELIZABETH:
Jewel is going to cast the moon.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.246
She's going to make
eyes for the bat.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.914
JEWEL:
I'm working the wand right now.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.782
ELIZABETH: And she's also making
this sugar staff.

19:11.784 --> 19:15.753
It's gonna have a blown sugar
orb and for the staff handle,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.021
it's going to be
a really cool idea

19:17.023 --> 19:19.257
to do, like,
the vertebrae down the back.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.525
Got to love "Halloween Wars."

19:20.527 --> 19:22.693
-That looks awesome.
-Yep.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.794
I'd throw that away.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.396
I would throw it away, too.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.131
We've decided to do a sea witch

19:27.133 --> 19:30.668
that goes to her
local broomstick dealership

19:30.670 --> 19:32.003
to buy her new broom,

19:32.005 --> 19:34.839
and she's tossing her
old broom into the ocean.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.774
Yeah, we're gonna go
for more of a spooky...

19:36.776 --> 19:39.410
CYNTHIA: We are working together
on the backdrop

19:39.412 --> 19:42.914
doing marbled cliffs
and the moonlit night.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.582
This whole amount
with fondant, correct?

19:44.584 --> 19:47.051
Yeah, basically, so
the mountain is coming down.
And the other side, too?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.753
I will be working on the witch,

19:48.755 --> 19:51.656
but I immediately start
working on the cake rocks.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.492
I'm also creating the mask
out of brushed chocolate

19:54.494 --> 19:56.027
and edible fabric.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.328
ARLEN:
I feel like our energy's back.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.531
Arlen is sculpting
the shipwreck out of pumpkin.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.434
-Look how thick this one is.
-I love it.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.937
I'm starting on my sugar waves.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.372
CYNTHIA: Orly's going to do
a poured sugar ocean

20:08.374 --> 20:12.009
and all those gorgeous sugar
waves crashing on shore.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.644
Are they supposed to be flat?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.413
I'll show you when I'm done.

20:15.415 --> 20:20.151
He'll also create sugar flowers,
chocolate coral, sugar lobster

20:20.153 --> 20:22.653
in order to really
sell that sea life.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.389
I'm done with my last
Halloween lobster.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.158
-Wow.
-That's it.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.393
Fly.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.963
Fly. [ Clears throat ]

20:31.965 --> 20:33.431
Fly!

20:33.433 --> 20:35.099
Look out.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.334
-Whoa!
-Ah.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.735
Ah, whew.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.303
That didn't work.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.705
Three hours.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.506
We're running out of time.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.076
[ Spits ] There's a lot of
straw in here. [ Coughs ]

20:45.078 --> 20:46.711
How long, do you think,
until you're done?

20:46.713 --> 20:49.280
Maybe 20 minutes and then
jump over to the body.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.148
The body's gonna be
made of one big pumpkin

20:51.150 --> 20:52.683
with scales carved
right into it.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.252
The beast will have
two legs in front,

20:54.254 --> 20:56.554
then I'll use a smaller
pumpkin to do the feet.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.757
The beast has large sugar eyes
that Cesar's going to make.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.093
Sabrina is, like,
this quiet little mouse,

21:02.095 --> 21:05.463
and I did not expect to see
robust creations out of her,

21:05.465 --> 21:06.964
and she knocked it
out of the park

21:06.966 --> 21:08.299
with the last challenge.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.101
She's definitely
the quiet storm.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.838
SABRINA: I'm feeling pretty good
right now, but that worries me.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.507
Moving on to my witch,
got to have her done.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.775
Now that I'm done
with the surfboard,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.143
I'm gonna move on to my witch

21:19.145 --> 21:21.145
made out of cereal treat
and modeling chocolate

21:21.147 --> 21:22.246
wrapped in fondant.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.914
Whew. I got a lot to do.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.249
I'm gonna get
the other eye in.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.651
I'm gonna size up the arms.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.219
KIMBERLY: Lenny has a lot
of pumpkin work to do.

21:28.221 --> 21:29.954
He's supposed to be
making two characters.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.389
He needs to start hustling.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.191
I don't want to mess up
his eyes, so I'm taking my time.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.660
We're just gonna make
this whole thing

21:35.662 --> 21:36.661
purple with more icing,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.162
and I still have
to do the flames,

21:38.164 --> 21:39.697
and I still have to do
my tasting element,

21:39.699 --> 21:41.632
and I'm stressed.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.302
Cynthia, I'm just working on
the wood grain on this ship.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.103
CYNTHIA:
We've decided to do a sea witch

21:46.105 --> 21:48.205
instead of your
typical land witch.

21:48.207 --> 21:51.242
I will be sculpting her body
out of modeling chocolate

21:51.244 --> 21:53.411
and rice cereal treats.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.946
Hey, guys, I'm going to
start my tasting element.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.683
Orly is making
chocolate barnacles.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.017
ORLY: Right now,
I'm in the process of

22:00.019 --> 22:01.552
chocolate mousse, you guys.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.555
CYNTHIA: Milk chocolate mousse
with a fresh raspberry center

22:04.557 --> 22:08.726
and a hazelnut crunch because
our witch's name is Witch Hazel.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.261
We're so punny.

22:10.263 --> 22:11.929
-Wow.
-It's done.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.631
All right, I'm gonna put
the ears on next.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.066
That's gonna take
a little while.

22:15.068 --> 22:18.135
Clive's carving this bat head
for the front of our motorcycle.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.272
I'm stacking the cake
on a chair to carve her body.

22:21.274 --> 22:24.408
I'm working on the witch
and the motorcycle,

22:24.410 --> 22:26.410
and I do multi-layers
for her skirt,

22:26.412 --> 22:28.012
so it's nice and textured.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.980
It's touching your stuff
a little bit.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.449
JEWEL: All right, guys,

22:31.451 --> 22:33.417
I have my marshmallow
base whipping.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.787
Our tasting element is going to
be an orange brandy marshmallow.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.022
Make some tasting.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.157
She's making these tiny
little chocolate cups,

22:40.159 --> 22:42.193
and then pipe
the marshmallow inside it

22:42.195 --> 22:44.128
and served with magic milk.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.230
Magic milk is, like,
a white hot chocolate

22:46.232 --> 22:47.965
that when you add
candy food coloring,

22:47.967 --> 22:49.200
it actually changes color.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.402
JEWEL: Water-soluble food
coloring shows orange

22:51.404 --> 22:53.704
on anything that isn't liquid,

22:53.706 --> 22:56.474
so when I give the judges
a little bit of a drink,

22:56.476 --> 22:58.042
they'll get a bit
of a surprise.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.443
All right.
Now is the time, Clive.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.979
-To what?
-To put the bat head on now.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.782
If you want to try it,
we need to do it now.
I'm working on it.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.650
I check on Clive,
and he's still not ready

23:06.652 --> 23:08.953
to put that bat head
on the cycle,

23:08.955 --> 23:10.221
and I really need that on there

23:10.223 --> 23:12.590
in order to be able
to put her arms and legs on.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.659
Seriously, I need something
on the front of this

23:15.661 --> 23:18.262
because I can't put her legs on

23:18.264 --> 23:21.065
without this darn
piece of pumpkin.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.634
If you don't get that bat
head on the cake,

23:23.636 --> 23:26.604
our witch is gonna have
no legs and no arms.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.839
You're going to have to
help me guide it, Elizabeth.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.040
Okay.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.208
So Clive puts his pumpkin
he also discussed

23:31.210 --> 23:32.977
onto the motorcycle...

23:32.979 --> 23:35.546
-Whoa.
-That is so heavy.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.615
...and it's way too big.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.049
I can't take any more out.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.085
The whole thing will collapse.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.488
At this point, what can we do?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.058
-Whoa.
-That is so heavy.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.728
Clive puts his pumpkin head
onto the motorcycle,

23:50.730 --> 23:52.797
and it's way too big.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.832
Is there any way
we can shave off --

23:54.834 --> 23:55.966
-The sides?
-Yes.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.368
Well, there's nothing left.

23:57.370 --> 23:58.636
Time is running out,

23:58.638 --> 23:59.904
and we're running
out of options.

23:59.906 --> 24:03.240
Okay.
Can we put a brace
underneath here?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.209
-Uh, no.
-[ Sighs ]

24:05.211 --> 24:07.478
Can you go and grab
another pumpkin

24:07.480 --> 24:10.581
and carve anything you can
that we can mount on the front

24:10.583 --> 24:12.216
that's gonna cover this plate?

24:12.218 --> 24:14.118
These look like
they'll fit, right,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.553
and you can make anything,

24:15.555 --> 24:19.089
and we'll put that as,
like the front bumper thingy.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.293
It's just looking terrible,
but we have to finish.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.595
I have moved on from painting.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.630
I was getting a little
caught up in my details.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.733
For the tasting element, Shelby
is gonna make a witch's brew.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.503
It's a tart cranberry sauce
served

24:32.505 --> 24:33.804
in a white chocolate brain.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.073
SHELBY:
I want it to look creepy.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.642
I want these guys to have
their natural color,

24:38.644 --> 24:40.678
and then I'm going to move
on to legs and hands.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.813
Lenny has taken a long time
on this one character,

24:42.815 --> 24:44.882
and he still has a whole
'nother one to go.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.284
I have an hour.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.786
I can't do another pumpkin.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.287
KIMBERLY: But he realizes
he doesn't have time to do

24:50.289 --> 24:51.589
a second character.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.057
Since we only have
time to do one,

24:53.059 --> 24:54.825
this character
needs to be perfect.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.827
LENNY: And then I got to work
on the legs, get him done.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.796
This is one of
our simpler designs,

24:58.798 --> 25:02.099
but we have to get that witch
board to go up in the air.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.802
How close are we to
hooking up the witch, Kim?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.470
We can put her on there now.

25:06.472 --> 25:07.771
Hold her back.
Hold her back.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.906
I'm letting go.

25:08.908 --> 25:09.940
One of the things
I'm worried about

25:09.942 --> 25:11.442
is placing the witch
on the board.

25:11.444 --> 25:14.778
The weight of this is so heavy
and it could fall.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.081
Now comes the hard part.
We got to get it over there.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.782
Is she gonna make the trip?

25:18.784 --> 25:20.551
This challenge is the witch
and her broomstick,

25:20.553 --> 25:22.152
so if this falls and we have

25:22.154 --> 25:24.121
no witch and broomstick,
we're going home.

25:24.123 --> 25:28.459
I'm letting go.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.127
-Whew.
-It's holding up pretty good.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.929
Whew.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.731
That witch was going
to wear me out.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.865
Shelby, how are you doing?

25:34.867 --> 25:36.500
I'm working on the flames.

25:36.502 --> 25:40.838
I'm having an issue because
I poured my isomalt way too hot.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.140
Shelby, please be careful.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.342
To make our witch look
like she's flying off,

25:45.344 --> 25:48.679
Shelby really needs to get
these sugar pieces on.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.948
My isomalt is finally -- Ah.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.150
Oh, my god.
I just burned my hand.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.919
-Oh, oh, oh.
-Uh-oh.

25:54.921 --> 25:59.223
Shelby is pulling super hot
isomalt and burns her hand.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.158
-Jeez.
-What's the matter, Shel?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.027
-My hand just really hurts.
-What?

26:03.029 --> 26:04.828
She's looking like she's
really struggling

26:04.830 --> 26:06.230
because her hand is hurting.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.465
-She's not gonna pull them.
-What?

26:08.467 --> 26:09.867
I don't know
if I can pull them.
She's not pulling.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.135
Oh, my god. No flames.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.570
Her hand is hurting so bad

26:12.572 --> 26:15.005
that she cannot pull
these sugar flames.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.074
I might make the flames out
of a mixture

26:17.076 --> 26:19.143
of wafer paper and isomalt.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.144
Not pulled sugar?

26:20.146 --> 26:21.912
That's gonna look horrible.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.781
There's no way you're gonna
be able to get fondant

26:23.783 --> 26:26.483
to stand up like a sugar
flame in that amount of time.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.952
-I think that I could do it --
-Okay.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.020
-...and pull it off.
-All right. Go for it.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.489
Your witch looks awesome.
How you doing on it?

26:32.491 --> 26:33.657
I'm doing good.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.292
I'm almost --
I think I'm almost done.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.961
Our witch is gonna be
riding on the back

26:36.963 --> 26:38.195
of this giant monster.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.531
We're really hoping to create
an entire world

26:40.533 --> 26:42.700
instead of just an object
that a witch rides.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.001
-Ready?
-Ready.

26:44.003 --> 26:47.371
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.539
I don't know where
they're going.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.341
It seems like a blank
slate at this point.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.643
It's gonna be interesting to see
if it all comes together or not.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.945
This monster is made of
a bunch of separate pumpkins,

26:54.947 --> 26:57.214
and it also takes up
a huge part of the stage.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.550
If we're gonna sell
this thing as a giant beast,

26:59.552 --> 27:01.619
the positioning of the piece
needs to be perfect.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.853
All right.
That's good, man.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.421
Okay, now we're talking.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.422
That's big-time prop.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.690
-Ooh.
-That's a big creature.

27:06.692 --> 27:07.791
That's pretty cool.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.026
We got to make this
a nighttime scene

27:09.028 --> 27:11.095
because they said
on "Clowns versus Zombies,"

27:11.097 --> 27:12.763
daytime was not that scary.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.064
Make it spooky.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.034
I decided to give her red hair
just because I felt

27:17.036 --> 27:19.169
like it would really
make her stand out.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.739
The sculpting that Sabrina
did on this witch's face

27:21.741 --> 27:23.841
was absolutely flawless.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.076
I've been doing great on
the tasting element, you guys.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.378
I got to keep that going.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.680
For the tasting element,
Cesar's making peanut crunch

27:29.682 --> 27:32.082
with a chocolate ganache
and orange caramel filling.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.350
It looks beautiful.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.718
It smells like orange caramel.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.854
It looks like that witch's
brew that we all love.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.856
JEFF: He's going to put this
in a chocolate shell

27:38.858 --> 27:40.991
and use it as the top of
a mushroom for our scene.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.560
Love it. Love it. Love it.
It came out perfectly.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.962
Teams, you have one hour.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.196
Oh, my gosh. One hour.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.531
JEWEL:
Don't stop. Don't stop working.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.999
Time isn't gonna stop,
neither should you.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.268
I'm gonna really set
these details in deep,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.404
and then she's kind of
throwing her broom down like,

27:53.406 --> 27:55.039
"I don't need
that broom anymore."

27:55.041 --> 27:56.807
We've decided to do a sea witch

27:56.809 --> 27:58.909
who has just purchased
her new broom,

27:58.911 --> 28:01.612
and she's tossing her
old broom into the ocean.

28:01.614 --> 28:03.647
Oh, my.
Look at the detail.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.949
Arlen is sculpting
the witch's face

28:05.951 --> 28:08.185
using our chocolate
skull as a base

28:08.187 --> 28:10.421
and covering that with
some modeling chocolate,

28:10.423 --> 28:12.322
adding those witchy details.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.858
ORLY:
Oh, looking good, Arlen.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.095
For the witch's clothes,
I throw on some edible fabric

28:18.097 --> 28:21.398
and then finish it off
by using a blowtorch to age

28:21.400 --> 28:23.100
and burn some of
the edges to give it

28:23.102 --> 28:24.468
that old, tattered look.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.403
I'm gonna need scissors.
She needs a haircut.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.439
Okay, guys, I'm gonna
start pouring my isomalt

28:28.441 --> 28:29.606
whether you like it or not.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.142
Orly starts to pour
the isomalt ocean,

28:32.144 --> 28:34.878
and it's going to take
at least 30 minutes

28:34.880 --> 28:37.381
for this isomalt to set,
and now, I'm nervous

28:37.383 --> 28:40.551
because that means we have
less than 30 minutes

28:40.553 --> 28:42.853
to put all
the finishing details on.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.189
Can I come in with the sand
while I'm waiting?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.657
Yes, please do it now.

28:46.659 --> 28:48.392
Set down, set down, set down.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.360
We just need to have
her centered.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.562
All right.
I'm gonna finish the wheel,

28:51.564 --> 28:53.297
and then I'll come
figure out backdrop.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.332
We are making a biker witch

28:55.334 --> 28:57.401
whose bat turned
into a motorcycle,

28:57.403 --> 29:00.571
but looking at our motorcycle,
there's no front.

29:00.573 --> 29:01.638
JEWEL:
Right now, we need to focus on

29:01.640 --> 29:03.173
getting the headlight on.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.042
We're going to try
and put it on though, right?
Put what on?

29:05.044 --> 29:07.277
-The pumpkin?
-It's on. The head is on.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.480
No.
No, up on the platform.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.582
We can't put it --
It's not gonna work.
Yeah.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.851
That's why the headlight
is going on.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.185
No.
We're at least gonna try.

29:15.187 --> 29:18.222
Time is running out
and Clive just is determined

29:18.224 --> 29:21.792
to get this same pumpkin
head on our motorcycle.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.827
-Don't jiggle.
-I can't not jiggle.

29:23.829 --> 29:24.995
It's not attached to anything,

29:24.997 --> 29:26.463
and this motorcycle
needs a second wheel.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.365
Just move this over just a hair.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.001
At this point,
we're pretty much all arguing.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.970
The tire needs to go here.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.104
-Sticks out.
-Yeah.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.272
The tire was supposed
to go down there.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.107
We've got this pole in the way,

29:37.109 --> 29:41.044
and Clive wants to force
the wheel and we can't do that.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.412
The wheel is gonna touch it.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.681
We can't have the wheels
positioned in the wrong way.

29:44.683 --> 29:47.417
We're just --
We're running out of options.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.021
-The tire needs to go here.
-Sticks out.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.322
Yeah, the tire was supposed
to go down there.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.857
We're running out of options.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.326
We can't have the wheels
positioned in the wrong way.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.562
-Under the chin.
-Well, slightly under the chin.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.964
It's not gonna fit
under the chin.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.867
It's just one more thing
we have to deal with.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.936
Well, just cover it
in black fondant for the moment.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.104
That's the best thing
we can do.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.939
He's gonna be
a police officer,

30:08.941 --> 30:12.609
so he's got to have blue pants.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.611
SHELBY: My flames look a mess.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.413
And I'm looking at it
like, mnh-mnh.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.115
These flames are not
gonna work out.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.316
Can you help me?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.584
Put them in the front
so they can see them.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.452
That broom is a mess.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.255
She burned herself
with the 350-degree sugar.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.857
TUCKER:
I think it shows a little bit.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.192
Shelby, how can I help you?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.727
I'm just painting wafer paper
with orange paint,

30:30.729 --> 30:32.296
and then putting it on.

30:32.298 --> 30:35.532
Whew. Come on, guys.
Let's go. Push, push, push.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.767
Come on, guys.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.368
CYNTHIA: Whoo-sah.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.405
Poured-sugar ocean,
gorgeous sugar waves,

30:41.407 --> 30:44.541
sugar lobster and sugar flowers.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.977
Orly is an amazing sugar artist.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.679
I'm going to put
all these lobsters on it.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.147
It's gonna look too busy.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.417
Remember, just because we can
doesn't mean we should.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.952
Putting down the tasting
elements now.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.887
-Is the bear trap over there?
-The bear trap is ready.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.823
Okay, I need that airbrush in,
like, five minutes.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.992
Five minutes?
You ain't got five minutes.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.727
-Is this the black airbrush?
-Yes, it is.

31:03.729 --> 31:09.199
Could we maybe get your help
putting some pieces on?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.300
Yeah, he's okay.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.902
The witch's arms
were done in a rush.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.270
The legs are cracked.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.339
The feet are dangling,
hanging off.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.675
The houses, they were going to
have windows, but at this point,

31:18.677 --> 31:20.544
I just don't think
we're gonna get to it.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.279
Clive, hey, are you done?

31:22.281 --> 31:24.348
What's happening right now?

31:24.350 --> 31:25.515
Miscommunication.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.384
You have one minute to finish.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.086
One minute.
All right.
Just do the best.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.153
Don't knock
anything over, please.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.455
So I'm putting the tag here.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.457
Yeah, just make sure you can
see it from the front.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.425
Any details that we're missing?

31:35.427 --> 31:38.195
At first, we did too much,
and then we didn't do enough.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.529
So you think this is a good
blend between the two?

31:39.531 --> 31:40.697
So I think that this is a good
blend between the two.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.367
You want me to hold that,
Sabrina?
Yes.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.502
-Just to block your lady, right?
-Yes.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.803
The flames,
they're coming off, Shel.

31:46.805 --> 31:47.804
Kim, where do you think
I should put these?

31:47.806 --> 31:49.273
-On the left side?
-Just put it on.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.707
This scene's just so empty.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.776
What else can we throw on this?
Do we have anything else?

31:52.778 --> 31:54.278
What do we got?
You need any more?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.680
Why is this up here?
Who moved it?
Yes.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.782
Someone should really learn
not to touch things.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.919
10, 9, 8...

32:01.921 --> 32:05.355
7, 6, 5...

32:05.357 --> 32:09.927
4, 3, 2, 1...

32:09.929 --> 32:11.828
Hands off your displays.

32:11.830 --> 32:15.599
-Whoo.
-Whoo.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.669
This poor pole actually looks
like part of the motorcycle.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.572
♪♪

32:22.574 --> 32:28.779
♪♪

32:28.781 --> 32:32.582
Teams, we wanted to see you roll
out your wildest visions

32:32.584 --> 32:34.785
of a witch's new ride.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.887
Candied Cadavers,
let's talk about it.

32:36.889 --> 32:40.190
Our sea witch, Hazel, is on
the market for a new broom,

32:40.192 --> 32:43.427
so she visits her
local broom dealer "ship"

32:43.429 --> 32:45.028
for the brand-new model.

32:45.030 --> 32:47.397
The witch is made
from modeling chocolate

32:47.399 --> 32:49.066
and rice cereal treats,

32:49.068 --> 32:51.401
fondant clothing,
and seaweed hair.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.637
The pumpkin is our shipwreck.

32:53.639 --> 32:57.941
Poured isomalt board,
sugar lobsters, sea flowers.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.577
ORLY: Our tasting element is
dark chocolate mousse

33:00.579 --> 33:02.346
with raspberry center,
rice cereal,

33:02.348 --> 33:04.514
and hazelnut crunch.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.550
Orly, all these
little crustaceans

33:06.552 --> 33:10.120
and all these characters here,
they look amazing.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.723
The lobsters,
the crashing waves,

33:12.725 --> 33:14.291
these are great sculptures.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.194
I love this perfectly
aerated mousse,

33:17.196 --> 33:20.163
and then you added the texture
of the rice cereal base.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.065
It was fresh and tart.

33:22.067 --> 33:24.935
The face on this witch
is outstanding.

33:24.937 --> 33:26.837
I've never seen seaweed hair.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.138
This is incredible.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.173
Thank you.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.109
Monsters of Mayhem, you're up.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.845
JEFF: She found a giant beast
trapped in an animal trap.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.781
She freed the beast,
and then the beast, in return,

33:37.783 --> 33:40.550
was able to give her rides
for the rest of her life.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.787
Our pumpkin elements
are the big beast.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.556
The witch is made out
of rice cereal treats

33:46.558 --> 33:47.858
and modeling chocolate,

33:47.860 --> 33:50.027
modeling chocolate
and fondant trees.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.829
Our sugar elements
are the animal trap

33:52.831 --> 33:54.664
and the eyeballs
on the beast.

33:54.666 --> 33:55.832
Since we're in magic forest,

33:55.834 --> 33:57.768
I decided to make
magic mushrooms.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.836
Candied peanuts
and orange caramel

33:59.838 --> 34:00.904
with a little
chocolate ganache,

34:00.906 --> 34:02.472
so a little bit of a bonbon.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.809
You know, I really didn't expect
the flavors of candied peanuts

34:05.811 --> 34:09.012
to blend so well with the orange
ganache, but it blended so well

34:09.014 --> 34:11.548
that I think that should be
the new chocolate bar flavor.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.417
[ Laughs ]

34:13.419 --> 34:16.720
Sabrina, that beautiful witch
looks just like you.
Thank you.

34:16.722 --> 34:20.757
This is the most smooth fondant
draping I've seen,

34:20.759 --> 34:23.760
but the trees,
they look like two sticks.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.395
I love that it's set at night

34:25.397 --> 34:27.898
and that it has the feeling
of Halloween to it.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.533
It's a beautiful diorama.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.101
TUCKER:
I feel like this has a real dark

34:31.103 --> 34:32.669
whimsical feel about it.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.938
You might've been able
to connect the pumpkin pieces

34:34.940 --> 34:36.840
for the beast
a little bit better.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.543
Overall, I feel like you guys
hit a home run with this one.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.411
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.813
Grave Expectations.

34:42.815 --> 34:46.149
We have our bad biker witch
who rides through the night

34:46.151 --> 34:48.885
on her screeching
bat motorcycle.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.521
The sugar elements
are her magic wand,

34:51.523 --> 34:54.191
blown sugar orb,
and cast sugar hand.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.725
Also, the moon is sugar.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.095
Pumpkin is the bat face,
and our cake is the body

34:58.097 --> 35:00.063
as well
as the rice cereal wheels.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.866
We have a chocolate-covered
orange brandy marshmallow

35:02.868 --> 35:04.835
and a milk base.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.269
Drop it inside.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.337
-Boop.
-Ooh.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.439
-Oh.
-Look at the magic.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.908
Once it is dropped into
a liquid, the color shows up.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.177
The magic milk is amazing.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.679
It's so cozy, and it's warm,

35:15.681 --> 35:18.748
and it's just a hint of
chocolate.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.550
What a great femme fatale here.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.086
I can tell exactly
what she is right away.

35:23.088 --> 35:26.857
The hair being pulled back,
the definition in her legs,

35:26.859 --> 35:31.862
the sugar vertebrae, that bat
face, very detailed, very nice.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.498
It just doesn't look complete.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.101
I think it's just all because
of timing, unfortunately.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.770
You had time issues,
and it shows.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.806
I wouldn't know that that was
a moon back there.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.107
You should've brought it up
a little bit more

35:44.109 --> 35:46.343
so I could see
that it was a moon.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.546
When you're making a movie,
the concept of a kick-butt witch

35:49.548 --> 35:51.148
on a motorcycle is pretty great.

35:51.150 --> 35:54.718
There is a sense of movement
about it even in the backdrop.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.520
Thank you.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.021
Zesty Zombies.

35:58.023 --> 36:02.392
There's this witch that came to
a store that pimps out brooms.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.262
She ends up stealing
the brand-new broom,

36:05.264 --> 36:08.064
ZZ rocket-powered 5,000.

36:08.066 --> 36:11.268
The backdrop is fondant
with wafer paper.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.104
The flames are sugar
and wafer paper.

36:14.106 --> 36:16.306
The board is fondant.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.275
The witch,
rice cereal treat,

36:18.277 --> 36:20.644
modeling chocolate,
and wafer paper.

36:20.646 --> 36:23.246
Our police office is pumpkin.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.815
This is my tart
cranberry dessert,

36:25.817 --> 36:27.584
and I served it
in a brain bowl

36:27.586 --> 36:29.386
that's made out
of white chocolate.

36:29.388 --> 36:32.889
It's kind of like a really
bright, sunshine compote,

36:32.891 --> 36:34.858
but I feel like you didn't
cook it long enough,

36:34.860 --> 36:36.826
and so there are
lots of grainy parts

36:36.828 --> 36:38.528
that are not necessary in there.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.532
And you have to wear
your proper gear.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.502
You were going to do flames
out of pulled sugar.

36:45.504 --> 36:49.039
Because you've injured yourself
with 350-degree sugar,

36:49.041 --> 36:53.043
now, it's a combination of
wafer paper and pulled sugar.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.245
It's just not successful.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.014
I think the sculpture
of the pumpkin is fantastic,

36:58.016 --> 37:00.850
but they don't feel like
they're in the same movie.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.587
I have to be honest,
this is my least favorite

37:03.589 --> 37:05.021
of what you guys have done.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.289
You guys seem to be
one of the forerunners

37:06.291 --> 37:07.757
in this competition,

37:07.759 --> 37:10.760
and I don't feel like
this one came close.

37:10.762 --> 37:15.298
Zesty Zombies,
thank you very much.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.201
Teams, the judges now need
to come up with a decision.

37:18.203 --> 37:21.171
We'll meet you back here
in just a few minutes.

37:21.173 --> 37:24.341
Each of the judges had something
negative to say about our piece.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.677
After hearing that, I think
we might be going home.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.279
We weren't working
together as a team,

37:29.281 --> 37:31.615
and our vision was not cohesive.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.484
This could be it
for the Zesty Zombies.

37:38.357 --> 37:41.291
Wow, judges.
You have a tough call right now.

37:41.293 --> 37:45.095
Four displays, some strengths,
some weaknesses.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.497
All right, let's talk about
Monsters of Mayhem.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.132
This is the definition
of teamwork.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.468
The witch is
flawlessly sculpted.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.070
The color composition is
really, really smooth,

37:54.072 --> 37:57.674
and the character,
such great details.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.142
You know, there are some flaws.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.945
I think the trees in the back,
they could definitely use more

38:01.947 --> 38:04.748
shaping and more character,
you know?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.917
Ceasar's tasting had
candied peanuts

38:07.919 --> 38:10.553
within a orange-ganache filling.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.123
Was it mind-blowing? No.

38:13.125 --> 38:16.593
Was it well balanced
and well done? Yes.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.361
Let's talk about
Candied Cadavers.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.130
Your eye is first drawn
to the witch

38:20.132 --> 38:21.665
because it's so dramatic,

38:21.667 --> 38:24.067
and then you look down and see
what she's surrounded by.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.469
TUCKER: Let's just talk about
Orly, the guy's a rock star.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.372
I mean, those little crustaceans
look like they're blown glass.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.708
They are so detailed
and so well done,

38:31.710 --> 38:34.077
but it's just hard
to see them from a distance.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.879
-Yeah, but it's worth it --
-Yes.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.080
...to step right up and look

38:37.082 --> 38:39.683
at all those beautiful
crustaceans.
Yeah.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.151
Similar to the display,

38:41.153 --> 38:44.020
Orly created so many
textures in his tasting.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.156
There's the fluffy,
aerated mousse.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.325
There's the fresh raspberry
in the middle,

38:48.327 --> 38:51.094
and who does not like
chocolate and raspberry?

38:51.096 --> 38:52.395
It was really good.

38:52.397 --> 38:54.497
All right, let's talk about
Grave Expectations.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.099
LI:
The idea, I thought, was great.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.501
Mm-hmm.
I love, like,
this femme fatale.

38:58.503 --> 39:03.206
She's on this really
bad motorcycle, her hair moving.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.910
It was such an ambitious thing
to create an entire bat chopper.

39:06.912 --> 39:10.347
It was a great idea.
They couldn't finish it.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.749
Your comment about
the paint job on the bat face,

39:12.751 --> 39:14.017
I agree 100%.
-Yeah, yeah.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.454
It was a little clumsy.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.489
She gave us a two-part treat,
brandied orange marshmallow,

39:19.491 --> 39:22.092
and then the milk
was simply magic.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.627
-Mm-hmm.
-I've never seen color-changing

39:24.629 --> 39:26.363
materials here
on "Halloween Wars."

39:26.365 --> 39:28.565
-That's the first time.
-It was subtly sweet, cozy.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.834
It was warm.
I think that's all we needed.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.435
How do you feel about
Zesty Zombies?

39:32.437 --> 39:34.204
Lenny created this face,

39:34.206 --> 39:36.606
and it's the kind of face
that we've been waiting for.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.209
Really developed,
really detailed.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.411
Unfortunately, when you have
a face that looks that good

39:41.413 --> 39:44.748
and then you have flames coming
out that look that bad,

39:44.750 --> 39:46.249
it's such an awkward balance.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.218
All of these people have to be
making the same movie,

39:48.220 --> 39:51.654
and in this case, I think that
we're making an anthology movie,

39:51.656 --> 39:53.390
and they were all making
different stories.

39:53.392 --> 39:56.626
Shelby's recipe, the cranberry
was nice and tart,

39:56.628 --> 39:59.396
but she didn't really cook
the materials long enough.

39:59.398 --> 40:00.663
It was nice, but...

40:00.665 --> 40:03.466
-You didn't want more.
-I did not want more.

40:03.468 --> 40:07.103
Well, now, it's time to send
another team to their graves.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.338
Do we know who it is?

40:08.340 --> 40:10.974
-Oh, this one hurts.
-But yes.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.844
Let's bring back our teams.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.280
Teams, for tonight's
Spine Chiller round,

40:17.282 --> 40:19.749
we asked you to trade in
the boring old broom

40:19.751 --> 40:23.820
for your most imaginative vision
of a witch's new ride.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.656
Two teams continued
to elevate their designs

40:26.658 --> 40:28.425
to soaring new heights.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.326
Monsters of Mayhem,

40:30.328 --> 40:32.996
Candied Cadavers,

40:32.998 --> 40:35.799
you both gave the judges
exactly what they're looking for

40:35.801 --> 40:39.369
creating the toughest
decision to date.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.938
I feel pretty confident
about this one.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.507
It would be great going into
next week with a win.

40:44.509 --> 40:50.213
The winner of
this challenge is...

40:50.215 --> 40:52.148
Monsters of Mayhem.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.518
Congratulations.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.521
The Monsters of Mayhem have
completely gelled on this one.

40:58.523 --> 41:01.291
It feels so good
to finally get a win.

41:01.293 --> 41:05.361
Unfortunately, two teams
came crashing down to Earth.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.263
Zesty Zombies,

41:07.265 --> 41:09.799
Grave Expectations.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.201
ELIZABETH: This is really bad.

41:11.203 --> 41:14.304
I hope that Jewel's magic milk
is enough to save us.

41:14.306 --> 41:17.373
They loved every single piece,
it just wasn't cohesive.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.876
This could be the end
for the Zesty Zombies.

41:19.878 --> 41:23.580
One of you is going
home right now.

41:23.582 --> 41:26.483
Grave Expectations,

41:26.485 --> 41:29.919
you're done
in this Halloween War.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.322
We just had too many problems
gone wrong with this one.

41:32.324 --> 41:36.159
There are too many elements
that just didn't come together.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.460
If I come back next year,

41:37.462 --> 41:40.597
I think I can really
kick some butt.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.865
All right, teams.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.734
Just remember that each battle
only gets tougher.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.902
We'll see you next time.
