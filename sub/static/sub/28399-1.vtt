WEBVTT

00:59.059 --> 01:02.323
-  In 1926, a United
States led international

01:02.366 --> 01:05.674
organization to find and capture
the Elder Gods was founded.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.199
This organization is known as
Artemis.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.290
The Black Site is a top-secret
facility

01:13.334 --> 01:16.250
used to deport the Elder Gods
back to the other dimension.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.515
An advanced laser system called
the Electrified Light Field

01:20.558 --> 01:22.386
keeps the Elder Gods from
escaping.

01:23.996 --> 01:27.174
Magic protects the site
from gunfire and explosions.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.917
Once they're sent back, they
never return.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.365
-  Help Me.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.088
-  Are you okay?

02:13.350 --> 02:14.786
- Just feel a bit uneasy.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.142
- We'll get him.

02:54.086 --> 02:54.913
Ren?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.002
Stay in the bed.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.090
It's safe there.

03:10.538 --> 03:11.365
Helen?

03:42.134 --> 03:42.961
Ren.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.820
- So, where are we going,
somewhere sunny, maybe?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.914
My girlfriend, she left me last
week.

05:05.957 --> 05:09.352
Yeah, so somewhere tropical
would be, would be awesome.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.271
- I'm a field officer.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.403
You're deportation.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.230
We don't talk.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.843
- Hey, I know the rules, okay?

05:21.886 --> 05:24.628
It'd just be nice to know
where I'm goin' for a change.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.414
That's all I'm sayin'.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.948
You'd have got on great with my
ex.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.606
- Test, test.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.994
-  73 active agents
on site.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.866
There are currently zero
visitors.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.174
-  You're in early, Joe?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.568
- Double shift.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.657
Understaffed again.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.703
They brought in three new
guys to train up though, so,

06:39.747 --> 06:41.313
I'll be out of here in no time.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.968
- You and me both, hopefully.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.449
- How, uh...

06:47.711 --> 06:48.712
How did the exam go?

06:50.584 --> 06:52.194
- Better.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.848
I think I did it this time.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.459
-  I still don't get
it, Ren, why don't you just

06:56.503 --> 06:59.462
transfer to one of the other
agencies like I'm doing?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.985
I mean, look around.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.335
There's nowhere near
enough budget for this.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.208
- My dad was a field officer,
his dad was a field officer,

07:06.251 --> 07:07.818
and I'm gonna be a field
officer.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.211
- Even if you do end up in the
field,

07:09.254 --> 07:11.648
there won't be any Elder
Gods left soon, that's why

07:11.692 --> 07:14.129
they haven't spent anythin'
on this place in years!

07:14.172 --> 07:16.087
- Then I'll be the last agent
standing.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.007
- Joe to Maintenance.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.183
The Electrified Light Field
at the left entrance is down.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.054
Again.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.056
Can someone with half a brain
cell

07:28.099 --> 07:30.319
please down there and fix it?

07:30.362 --> 07:31.799
-  Uh, no.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.105
We're in the Deportation
Zone today prepping the cell.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.804
So, it'll have to wait.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.980
-  It's your funeral.

08:09.924 --> 08:14.842
- It's not real.

08:24.068 --> 08:24.895
- It's in.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.558
I hope it's good news this time.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.212
- Me, too.

08:40.910 --> 08:43.260
- Oh, the newbies are
upstairs, by the way.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.437
It's your turn to give 'em the
talk.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.917
- Seriously?

08:46.961 --> 08:49.224
Can you do it for me?
- Not a chance.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.617
Unless that letter says
different,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.488
they're 100% your problem.

08:53.881 --> 08:57.058
- Well, I guess I'm about to
find out.

08:57.885 --> 08:58.712
- Good luck.

09:33.921 --> 09:37.577
-  Call for
Ren Reid, line three.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.081
- Agent Reid, how can I help?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.343
- What's wrong with you?

10:09.347 --> 10:11.045
- Same old shit.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.307
I failed the test again.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.658
- Oh, Ren, I'm sorry.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.836
- As if you didn't know already.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.795
- Yeah, but, still.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.712
- You should've given me a
heads-up, Jay.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.497
- We can talk about this later.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.674
I've got news.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.154
Big news.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.024
- How big?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.030
- We got the motherfucker.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.531
- Agent Washbourn, how can I
help?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.057
Roger that, we'll be ready.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.155
Attention, we have a
level 10 hostile inbound.

11:18.199 --> 11:21.811
All non-essential personnel
must leave the site immediately.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.205
Drop whatever you're doing and
go.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.688
-  You
can lose the hood now.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.692
- Well, great work as always,
guys.

11:34.215 --> 11:38.480
I have absolutely no idea
what we do, but uh, go team.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.352
- You're needed at the Black
Site.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.269
- No, no, no, no.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.402
No, um, look, I told you,
my girlfriend's left me.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.404
I need to go fly back to see
her.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.759
Can't you get someone else
to do it just this once?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.675
- "Level 10 Deportation Officer
needed."

11:59.719 --> 12:01.068
You're the closest.

12:01.111 --> 12:01.938
Sorry.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.508
- You know, I do have
a photographic memory.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.346
- I'll be taking you
through orientation for your

12:18.389 --> 12:22.219
new roles here at the Artemis
International Black Site.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.918
The Black Site operated as a
global headquarter for Artemis

12:24.961 --> 12:27.616
between 1941 and the early '70s.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.271
Ever since, the facility
has been mostly closed down,

12:30.314 --> 12:33.753
and is used for deportations
only, as and when is needed.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.147
- So, this place is
super dangerous, right?

12:38.366 --> 12:39.889
- Occasionally.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.326
We run the site on a skeleton
crew between deportations,

12:42.370 --> 12:44.502
because we have one hell
of a security system.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.243
So, most of the time
you'll be more than safe,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.071
even though you can't see it.

12:48.115 --> 12:51.118
- Yeah, okay, but I haven't seen
any guns.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.684
- Guns don't work on the Black
Site.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.555
- Why not?

12:54.948 --> 12:57.515
- In the 1980s, we captured
the Elder God, Sudo,

12:57.559 --> 12:59.909
and brought him here for
deportation.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.911
Sudo's worshipers seized the
facility,

13:01.955 --> 13:03.434
and a lot of good agents were
killed.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.827
After that, the site was warded

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
to stop it from ever happening
again

13:06.873 --> 13:09.353
with the markings that you can
see all around this building.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.703
The incantations used prevent
combustion from occurring

13:11.747 --> 13:15.055
on sites, making explosions
and gunfire impossible.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.580
There's no hot water and
all hot food is microwaved.

13:19.537 --> 13:22.018
You're gonna want thermal
underwear for the winter.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.194
- Hang on, so I can't smoke on
site?

13:24.238 --> 13:26.414
-  Only if you get
electrocuted.

13:33.029 --> 13:36.076
Alright, please watch the
following video carefully.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.740
- Welcome, I'm Professor August
Kellerman,

13:48.784 --> 13:50.655
Chief Research Officer for
Artemis.

13:51.787 --> 13:56.618
This facility is one of
three, designated Site Beta.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.708
Its purpose is the research,
questioning,

13:59.751 --> 14:02.537
and deportation of the Elder
Gods,

14:02.580 --> 14:07.585
using incantations from ancient
texts translated by myself.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.199
And the team of experts here at
Artemis.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.855
As a member of the
Artemis Black Site team,

14:15.898 --> 14:18.466
you may be asked to
perform various duties.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.513
Each job is important,

14:22.557 --> 14:27.388
and ensures the continued
safety of the entire human race.

14:31.087 --> 14:34.003
Soon after their release in
1926,

14:34.047 --> 14:36.440
we discovered that the
Elder Gods had been weakened

14:36.484 --> 14:39.226
by their time in the other
dimension,

14:39.269 --> 14:42.838
greatly reducing their power and
size.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.927
One form of recovery for them

14:44.971 --> 14:48.017
is to hide inside a human
vessel,

14:48.061 --> 14:51.978
and drain them of their
life force, or essence.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.069
Using hitherto forgotten
scripts,

14:56.112 --> 14:59.333
the research team here at
Artemis have been able to train

14:59.376 --> 15:03.380
our field teams to bind the
Elder Gods to a human vessel.

15:04.338 --> 15:08.298
Thus, making them safe for
transportation to this site,

15:08.342 --> 15:09.909
where they will be deported.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.436
Do not make eye-contact
directly with an Elder.

15:15.479 --> 15:20.484
To the untrained mind, the
effects can be irreversible.

15:28.188 --> 15:31.104
- Um, actually, this
video's a little outdated.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.976
As I said, you can't smoke
on the Black Site anymore.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.587
- Reid.

15:36.631 --> 15:37.458
Mind if we talk?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.245
They've caught him, you know.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.465
Erebus.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.163
The one that killed your
parents.

15:48.034 --> 15:48.904
- I got the call.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.733
- John Austin?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.564
He recommended I send
you home on this one.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.435
Did he tell you that?
- You can't!

16:00.089 --> 16:01.699
- I can.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.831
I'm the boss.

16:05.094 --> 16:08.184
But luckily for you, I think
seeing this thing deported

16:08.228 --> 16:10.230
will actually do you some good.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.927
Face your fears.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.799
Type of thing my mom would've
done to me.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.584
She was a mean old bitch, that
one.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.632
You don't have a mom, so
consider it a freebie.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.591
- Thank you.

16:24.679 --> 16:25.985
That means a lot to me.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.249
- The deportation officer
will be arriving later today.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.511
You're gonna sign him in, prep
him,

16:30.554 --> 16:33.122
and take him down to the bye-bye
room.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.689
Then you can watch that piece of
shit

16:34.732 --> 16:36.212
go back to where he came from.

16:37.909 --> 16:42.218
After this, though, no more
trying to pass your exam.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.613
Commit to your job here.

16:45.656 --> 16:46.657
And we move on.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.444
Erebus is being brought in now
in a wagon.

16:50.487 --> 16:54.926
I expect you not to interfere
with the interrogation.

16:54.970 --> 16:59.540
Just get Sam Levi ready
for the deportation.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.284
Go on, then.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.154
Out you go.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.682
-  Level 10 hostile
inbound.

17:12.553 --> 17:16.035
All non-essential personnel
must leave the site now.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.082
- Check all your weapons
in at the main door

17:20.126 --> 17:22.345
and collect a baton, let's
get this asshole down

17:22.388 --> 17:25.305
to the interrogation room as
quick as we can, no mistakes.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.007
Is he secure?
- Yes, sir.

17:32.051 --> 17:32.921
- I'll be in soon.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.233
What're you still doin' here?

17:40.276 --> 17:42.670
- Your request to have
me sent home was denied.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
- Fuck, Ren, you can't be here.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.282
Who knows what effect
this asshole's gonna have

17:46.326 --> 17:48.067
on you once he's awake?

17:49.851 --> 17:51.461
Just go home.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.942
- I have every right to watch
this fucker get deported, Jay.

17:53.985 --> 17:54.812
And you know it.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.076
- If your dad was here,

17:57.119 --> 17:59.556
he'd want me to send you
somewhere safe.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.818
- Well, he isn't, Jay.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.040
And it's not your fault
that he isn't, either.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086
Look, I'm grateful for
everything

18:07.129 --> 18:08.783
that you and your mom did for
me.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.133
But you're not my guardian.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.571
This thing took him away from
me.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.097
And I wanna see his eyes
when you send him back.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.188
Besides, I'm on duty.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.581
I'm checking the deportation
officer in.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.583
- Yeah, who we got?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.324
-  Um, Sam something?

18:28.368 --> 18:29.804
- Sam Levi.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.588
Fuck, not that guy.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.286
- Why, what's wrong with him?

18:33.329 --> 18:36.550
-  Nothing,
he's just kind of borin'.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.381
Okay.

18:41.424 --> 18:42.991
You can stay.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.472
And I won't complain about it.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
But if you start to see things,

18:48.779 --> 18:52.131
I want you to promise me you
will go home.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.222
- Just don't go easy on him in
there.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.399
- I won't.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.150
- This meat suit you've put me
in.

19:56.064 --> 19:59.633
It's hardly five-star
accommodation, is it?

20:33.362 --> 20:34.233
Pain.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.758
Such a fleetingly mortal
experience.

20:41.805 --> 20:45.244
But playing rough won't
get you anywhere with me.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.594
- Oh, yeah?

20:49.117 --> 20:50.510
We'll see about that.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.428
- Will you pointless
specks of dust hurry up

20:55.471 --> 20:57.734
and get this conversation
over and done with?

20:59.562 --> 21:01.608
I believe I have a deportation
to attend.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.272
- Plenty of time for that.

21:14.925 --> 21:19.016
After all, you've got
an eternity to waste.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.980
So, let's get down to business.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.939
Erebus.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.332
The Devourer.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.942
The Filler of Space.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.770
He Who Comes in the Dark.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.601
Quite the impressive
list of titles you have.

21:39.863 --> 21:40.908
- You humans.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.259
Always trying to give names to
things.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.785
As if it will give you some
sort of ownership over it.

21:51.919 --> 21:55.139
The truth is, nothing in the
Cosmos cares what you call it.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.796
Nothing in the Cosmos
cares about you at all.

22:02.016 --> 22:07.021
- Well, this is turning into
the worst first date ever.

22:07.456 --> 22:10.503
Let's start again,
shall we?

22:10.546 --> 22:12.548
What would you like me to call
you?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.466
- For you to speak my true name,

22:17.510 --> 22:19.903
I would have to cut your tongue
out.

22:19.947 --> 22:23.603
-  Well, I
think we'll pass on that.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.215
This fine fellow whose body
you're currently wearing

22:27.258 --> 22:30.914
is convicted murderer, Jerome
Davis.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.961
- He sounds fun.
- Jerome it is, then.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.789
So, Jerome.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.228
This is how it works.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.797
I need the name and location
of one other Elder God,

22:43.840 --> 22:47.670
and then we can make all this
unpleasantness just go away,

22:47.714 --> 22:50.238
and send you back to hell
quickly.

22:50.281 --> 22:51.631
How does that sound?

22:53.633 --> 22:56.200
- The illusion of power.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.376
It must feel nice.

22:58.855 --> 22:59.726
Comforting, even.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.644
But I am one of the first five
things in all of existence.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.691
Born from the chaos of this
universe.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.521
Time and space
present themselves to me

23:12.565 --> 23:14.523
in a way you couldn't possibly
imagine.

23:15.481 --> 23:19.223
And even though mankind
knows this, you're still

23:19.267 --> 23:22.313
arrogant enough to think
you might have anything

23:22.357 --> 23:25.795
over something like me.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.410
- What's funny, Jerome,

23:32.323 --> 23:34.108
is that the Elder God, Nixx,

23:35.675 --> 23:38.025
apparently said something very
similar.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.770
You and her were close, right?

23:46.381 --> 23:49.079
Her intel kept us busy for
years.

23:49.123 --> 23:52.561
- You are not fit to speak her
name.

23:52.605 --> 23:56.435
- She was Agent Austin's first
ever deportation, I believe.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.570
Must've been a lonely 20
years for you without her.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.229
- If it wasn't for these
symbols,

24:08.272 --> 24:10.840
and cheap parlor tricks
that you have bound me with,

24:12.625 --> 24:16.455
I would turn you and everybody
in this facility inside-out.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.720
Just to pass the time.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.638
- Well, I'll uh, bear that in
mind.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.945
While we torture the shit out of
you.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.367
-  Agent Ren Reid.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.068
- You might wanna keep this
one covered up whilst you wait.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.635
- Why?

25:06.679 --> 25:07.506
- He's a talker.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.164
-  I can handle that.

25:29.179 --> 25:33.749
-  There are
currently two visitors on site.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.287
- Ow.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.600
Hey.

25:58.644 --> 25:59.993
Can I?

26:00.036 --> 26:01.385
Okay.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.256
Right.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.346
I'm Sam.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.216
Sam Levi.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.479
- I know.

26:12.483 --> 26:15.486
- Sorry, um, so what's
on the agenda today?

26:18.054 --> 26:20.013
- Well, it's need-to-know only,
and you--

26:20.056 --> 26:22.406
- Don't tell me, I don't need to
know.

26:39.249 --> 26:40.076
Hello.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.296
Hi, me again.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.124
Seriously, what is the plan for
today?

26:44.167 --> 26:46.387
Because my girlfriend's at home,
she's packing up all of her

26:46.430 --> 26:49.782
stuff as we speak, and I kinda
need to get back to her ASAP?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.568
- So, did you dump her, or she
dumped you?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.309
- Nobody dumped anybody.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.399
It's complicated.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.531
- She dumped you.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.403
What did you do?

27:02.446 --> 27:04.187
- I didn't do anything.

27:08.365 --> 27:11.673
If you must know, she um...

27:12.979 --> 27:15.198
She called me boring.
- Yeah, I heard that.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.638
So you wanna know the plan!

27:19.681 --> 27:23.598
Uh, okay, well basically
we're gonna stay here,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.687
until they call for us over the
intercom,

27:25.731 --> 27:28.821
at which point you'll put back
on the hood and the earphones

27:28.864 --> 27:31.780
and when they ask you to, you
will recite a piece of text

27:31.824 --> 27:34.043
that apparently you've
memorized.

27:34.087 --> 27:34.914
Sounds good?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.004
- Sounds boring, actually.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.267
- Well, you would know.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.707
Alright, I'm gonna go and get
us some drinks while we wait.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.709
This door locks automatically.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
So don't go trying to look
around.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.191
- Fine.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.672
It's not like I've got
anywhere important to be.

27:53.715 --> 27:58.677
- Good boy.

28:01.027 --> 28:03.986
-  This isn't working,
I say we just send him down

28:04.030 --> 28:06.249
to the bye-bye room and deport
him.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.947
-  With all due respect,

28:07.990 --> 28:09.992
we got a lot more we can hit
with first.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.473
- Trust me, Agent Austin,
I'd love to sit here

28:12.516 --> 28:15.737
and watch you cut fingers
and toes off all night,

28:15.781 --> 28:19.175
but there are some kidney
stones you just can't piss out.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.960
You understand what I'm saying.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.050
Get him down to Deportation.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.487
- I owe Rob Reid.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.969
I'm the reason Erebus got away
that night.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.537
I'm the reason Ren's family are
dead.

28:33.581 --> 28:34.756
- Ah.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.757
Ren Reid.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.109
She's grown up to be such a...

28:41.763 --> 28:42.590
Disappointment.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.637
- Shut your mouth.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.773
- You know, I've felt her her
entire life.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.298
We're connected.

28:58.345 --> 28:59.781
I can feel her now.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.045
In this building.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.310
Just as I always knew she would
be.

29:11.401 --> 29:14.578
-  What are you talking
about?

29:14.622 --> 29:17.625
- I feel a little reunion coming
on.

29:18.974 --> 29:19.801
How do I look?

29:22.064 --> 29:24.806
- I need to go get Ren
off site just in case.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.329
- Agreed, let's go.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.549
- Get this piece of shit down to
a cell.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.072
We'll bring back the deportation
officer.

29:30.116 --> 29:34.250
- I hate to burst your
little Alpha Human bubble...

29:37.166 --> 29:38.646
But you're already too late.

29:38.689 --> 29:39.995
- Yeah?

29:40.039 --> 29:42.824
Why is that?

29:42.868 --> 29:43.694
- Because.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.176
They're already here.

29:55.097 --> 29:58.361
- Joe, can I get a check on
the left entrance, please?

29:58.405 --> 30:00.189
-   I've
already told maintenance,

30:00.233 --> 30:03.192
the whole area is down, I can't
see anything from this end.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.891
- Roger that, I'll take a look.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.229
- Left entrance, come in.

30:40.273 --> 30:44.146
What did you find?

30:44.190 --> 30:47.454
I'm surrounded by
idiots.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.412
Left entrance, come in.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.416
Hello?

31:07.387 --> 31:10.129
-  The telephones
are no longer in service.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.654
There are 12 visitors on site.

31:14.568 --> 31:18.746
There are 31 visitors on site.

31:18.789 --> 31:22.793
There are 53 visitors on site.

31:22.837 --> 31:26.841
There are 53 visitors on site.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.453
There are 53 visitors on site.

31:30.497 --> 31:34.066
-  I've secured
the monitoring room.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.902
- Hey, do you mind if I read one
of these?

31:45.991 --> 31:47.688
- Those are need-to-know.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.387
- So, why put them in a waiting
room?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.913
- So that if someone
like you touches them,

31:54.956 --> 31:57.393
then I have a legitimate
excuse to hurt you.

31:59.787 --> 32:00.614
- Wow.

32:02.355 --> 32:06.185
I'm glad I'm not the
only one not getting any.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.798
- You know, I used to date a guy
like you.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.106
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.803
Boring.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.023
He was all clingy and needy.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.763
You know how I broke up with
him?

32:21.504 --> 32:22.766
- How, how?

32:22.810 --> 32:23.942
- Over text.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.119
-  Charming.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.033
- I'm just saying.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.081
Your girlfriend could've
been much harsher.

32:33.125 --> 32:37.216
I would've been.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.010
- Okay, the gas has started to
clear,

32:49.054 --> 32:51.839
but there are still plenty
of active cameras left.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.884
Keep your mask on,

32:53.928 --> 32:56.844
unless you wanna end up
getting picked up by Artemis.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.977
-  Got it, keep your masks
on.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.046
This way.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.570
- Don't move!

33:34.142 --> 33:35.491
I said, don't fucking move!

33:37.450 --> 33:39.582
Attention all officers we have
a situation in the blue zone.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.679
- Find the deportation officer.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.377
Do not kill him.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.900
-  Copy that, follow me.

33:55.642 --> 33:58.732
-  Security
protocol 18 is now in effect.

33:58.775 --> 34:02.344
Lockdown will commence in three
minutes.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.833
-  All personnel, the
facility is under attack.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.183
This is not a drill,
get your shit together.

34:28.152 --> 34:28.978
- Ker?
- Go.

34:30.545 --> 34:33.071
- They're moved Erebus to
the Deportation Zone already.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.072
I'm just tryin' to find you a
route now.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.121
There are two more agents headed
your way.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.212
-  The E.L.F will activate,
hold on.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.481
Where is Erebus?

34:55.179 --> 34:56.311
Kill them both.

35:00.924 --> 35:04.232
- Okay, take the door behind
you, keep turning left.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.017
Erebus is there.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.767
- Give me Erebus and we'll go.

35:18.768 --> 35:21.771
- You better be sure you can win
this.

35:21.815 --> 35:25.079
Otherwise, you're gonna wish
you found Jesus instead.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.952
-  Security
protocol 18 is now in effect.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.173
20 seconds until lockdown.

35:35.568 --> 35:38.223
10 seconds until lockdown.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.490
Five seconds until lockdown.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.234
Three, two, one.

35:50.409 --> 35:53.325
Security protocol 18 is now in
effect.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.767
Electrified Light Field is now
activated.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.258
- Hey.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.172
Hey.

36:18.567 --> 36:19.394
Hey.

36:20.917 --> 36:21.744
- Help me.

36:24.182 --> 36:28.751
-  What's wrong with
you? Snap out of it, come on.

36:39.762 --> 36:43.810
- What the fuck?

36:49.381 --> 36:50.773
What is going on?

36:50.817 --> 36:52.384
- I don't know!

36:52.427 --> 36:53.646
You started freaking out and
some woman came on the intercom

36:53.689 --> 36:56.692
and said we were under attack!
- Shh!

36:58.999 --> 37:01.915
-  Hold on, I heard
somethin'.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.312
-  All clear.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.009
-  Same here.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.576
- Fuck.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.360
I've gotta get you down
to the deportation room.

37:12.404 --> 37:15.320
- Are you joking?
- You listen to me, dickhead.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.800
I don't know you and I don't
care what your hangups are.

37:17.844 --> 37:20.586
The closest person I have to
family is trapped down there.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.283
So you're gonna get
over your fucking self,

37:22.327 --> 37:24.154
and you're gonna come with me.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.417
Am I making myself clear?

37:31.379 --> 37:32.424
-  We found Ker.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.907
Decode that door.

37:39.779 --> 37:40.649
-  How long?

37:42.956 --> 37:45.306
-  What're we supposed to
do now?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.395
- Radio the others and find
them.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.834
We're gonna get Erebus out of
that body, we need him alive.

37:51.878 --> 37:52.879
-  We'll find him.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.924
You two, come with me.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.665
-  Access denied.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.102
Electrified Light Field still
activated.

38:15.728 --> 38:16.685
-  Over here.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.963
- I see you've met Ker.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.326
- How do you like your new cell?

38:58.727 --> 39:00.773
- More cheap parlor tricks.

39:05.778 --> 39:06.605
Boring.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.361
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:45.948 --> 39:46.775
Ren.

39:58.352 --> 40:02.748
Ren, it's John, I'm locked
down in the Deportation Zone

40:02.791 --> 40:04.793
with Wilkinson and our guest.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.882
- Jay, are you okay?

40:08.754 --> 40:10.451
- I'm hurt pretty bad.
- How bad?

40:11.452 --> 40:12.584
- That's not important.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.065
- Yes, it is.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.327
Tell me.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.721
- You need to get Sam Levi outta
here.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.636
Erebus is no good to them
without him.

40:22.811 --> 40:23.638
- Fuck that.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.032
- Ren.

40:27.294 --> 40:28.687
- Hang in there, I'm coming.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.167
Hey, hey.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.256
You see a bad guy, you stab him,
got it?

40:35.476 --> 40:36.303
- Ah, no.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.046
Alright, well, what do we do
now?

40:40.089 --> 40:41.700
-  Your file said you
have a photographic memory.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.266
- Yeah, so?

40:43.310 --> 40:44.746
- So if we're gonna get you
down to that room and prove

40:44.790 --> 40:46.531
you're not the boring fuck-face
everybody says you are,

40:46.574 --> 40:48.271
we're gonna need something
first.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.187
- "Boring fuck-face?"

41:08.291 --> 41:10.946
What are these symbols for?

41:10.990 --> 41:12.513
- They're called wards.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.950
They protect the facility
against certain types of attack.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.823
They activated when the
security system switched on.

41:17.866 --> 41:18.693
- Ah.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.000
And what about that?

41:21.043 --> 41:22.697
Is that part of the security
system, too?

41:22.741 --> 41:23.568
- Mm-hm.

41:25.657 --> 41:28.790
That is an E.L.F, short for
Electrified Light Field.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.492
Yeah, go through that,

41:34.535 --> 41:37.669
and you'll know what a Pop
Tart feels like at breakfast.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.540
- Well, how're we supposed
to get through that?

41:39.584 --> 41:40.410
- I'll show you.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.814
Shh, shh.

41:52.858 --> 41:56.688
-  This way, there
must be a way through.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.699
-  Access denied.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.788
Electrified Light Field still
activated.

42:15.968 --> 42:17.622
- Don't do anything.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.193
You've got this.

42:24.237 --> 42:25.630
You're a bad ass.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.675
You can do it.

42:29.242 --> 42:33.072
- You are not filling me with
a lot of confidence here.

42:33.115 --> 42:35.640
- Oh, what's takin' so long?

42:35.683 --> 42:38.468
Come on, man, you fuckin' idiot.

42:38.512 --> 42:39.687
-  Access denied.

42:39.731 --> 42:42.647
Electrified Light Field still
activated.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.605
-  Sorry to interrupt,
guys.

42:44.649 --> 42:46.651
You don't know where
the bathroom is, do you?

42:46.694 --> 42:49.349
-  You're not goin'
anywhere.

42:49.392 --> 42:51.307
-  Yeah, let's cut her up.

42:51.351 --> 42:53.701
-  Electrified
Light Field still activated.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.849
Proximity warning.

43:11.850 --> 43:13.939
Electrified Light Field still
activated.

43:34.960 --> 43:35.874
- Next time...

43:37.789 --> 43:40.443
- You said, "Don't do anything."

43:40.487 --> 43:42.968
- Yeah, well, I meant do
something.

43:43.011 --> 43:45.274
- You know, you've got
real communication issues.

43:50.584 --> 43:52.804
- I'm not gonna lie to you, Jay.

43:52.847 --> 43:54.414
You might need a few stitches.

43:56.024 --> 43:56.851
- Oh.

43:58.244 --> 44:00.072
That doesn't look good.

44:02.074 --> 44:03.641
- Go fuck yourself.

44:19.047 --> 44:21.528
- You can make all the
jokes you want, old timer.

44:22.529 --> 44:23.486
It won't matter.

44:32.278 --> 44:34.846
You're still going back
by the end of tonight.

44:36.630 --> 44:39.677
- I'll never get used to that
stench of human arrogance.

44:42.505 --> 44:45.552
You know, you're like the
sweaty armpit of the Cosmos.

44:58.783 --> 45:02.047
- You Elder Gods all talk a big
game.

45:03.396 --> 45:08.357
Always like to remind us how
insignificant you think we are.

45:15.582 --> 45:16.844
Yet here you are.

45:17.758 --> 45:19.368
Hiding on our planet.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.720
And living inside human hosts.

45:31.293 --> 45:35.645
- You know, there was a time
when I was so powerful--

45:37.430 --> 45:40.128
So beyond what your little
minds could comprehend,

45:41.564 --> 45:43.088
I didn't even notice your kind.

45:47.179 --> 45:52.053
But you crave
attention, like little children.

45:56.710 --> 46:00.105
Then you stripped us of our
glory, and then our home.

46:03.282 --> 46:05.197
You had no right.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.067
Or reason.

46:09.505 --> 46:12.508
You know, I have had eons,

46:14.641 --> 46:15.773
to reflect on your kind.

46:18.688 --> 46:20.081
The things we could've done.

46:20.952 --> 46:22.562
The mistakes we might have made.

46:23.955 --> 46:26.784
But ultimately, I realized,

46:28.133 --> 46:32.485
just how utterly pointless you
are.

46:40.145 --> 46:42.234
Does that not bother you?

46:43.844 --> 46:47.239
Do you not fear your own
insignificance?

46:47.282 --> 46:48.327
- We have each other.

46:51.112 --> 46:52.374
There's more significance in
that

46:52.418 --> 46:54.768
than a thing like you
could ever understand.

46:57.249 --> 47:01.819
See, eventually, it'll come
down to you or us.

47:01.862 --> 47:02.994
And we chose us.

47:05.387 --> 47:09.435
- I had companionship on a scale
you would never understand.

47:12.612 --> 47:14.092
And then you took her from me.

47:16.616 --> 47:17.530
And deported her.

47:22.665 --> 47:24.189
What gives your species the
right

47:24.232 --> 47:26.060
to do the things that you do to
mine?

47:28.802 --> 47:30.151
- It gives us purpose.

47:37.158 --> 47:37.985
- Touche.

47:42.772 --> 47:46.472
Well, let's hope our
little mutual friend, Ren,

47:46.515 --> 47:48.343
finds her purpose this evening.

47:53.131 --> 47:53.958
- Sit.

48:02.967 --> 48:05.273
This facility is split into
three zones.

48:05.317 --> 48:07.101
Blue, Green and Red.

48:07.145 --> 48:09.016
We're currently in Red Zone.

48:09.060 --> 48:12.106
Each zone is separated by
the E.L.F security system.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.239
Now, this folder contains
all the deactivation codes

48:14.282 --> 48:17.155
for each zone, so use
your oversized brain,

48:17.198 --> 48:19.418
and remember the codes.

48:19.461 --> 48:20.288
- Okay.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.901
- Before we're both violently
killed.

48:43.572 --> 48:45.923
The E.L.F box is right here.

49:15.082 --> 49:18.956
-  Security
protocol 18 is now in effect.

49:18.999 --> 49:22.524
- What is going on with you?

49:22.568 --> 49:23.961
- Nothing.
- Really?

49:30.184 --> 49:33.709
- I saw an Elder God when I
was a kid, it fucked me up.

49:33.753 --> 49:34.754
I'm dealin' with it.

49:36.625 --> 49:38.801
- Wait, is that why they
cover my eyes and ears?

49:40.107 --> 49:41.195
So I don't go crazy?

49:44.024 --> 49:45.547
- I'm not crazy.

49:47.375 --> 49:50.422
Ever since they brought
Erebus into the facility,

49:50.465 --> 49:53.120
the things I've been seeing
are getting more intense.

49:53.164 --> 49:54.817
- Well, what can we do?

49:59.561 --> 50:01.215
- Switch off this doorway.

50:01.259 --> 50:03.913
So we can go and deport
the son of a bitch.

50:03.957 --> 50:04.784
- Okay.

50:16.187 --> 50:18.972
-  Access granted.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.800
- Okay, heads up, everyone.

50:20.843 --> 50:23.411
The deportation officer
is headed your way,

50:23.455 --> 50:24.847
and he's got company.

50:26.284 --> 50:29.896
She's got some moves, so watch
yourself.

50:33.247 --> 50:35.032
-  First number
accepted.

50:52.266 --> 50:54.268
- Phones are still down.

50:55.574 --> 50:57.576
- Second number accepted.

50:57.619 --> 50:58.446
- Uh-oh.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.537
I'm guessing the beeps
are bad news for you guys.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.017
- Oh, shut up.

51:04.887 --> 51:09.979
You know, for the fifth-oldest
thing in existence,

51:10.023 --> 51:11.416
I'd have thought you'd gotten
bored

51:11.459 --> 51:13.331
with the sound of your voice by
now.

51:16.464 --> 51:18.031
You see?

51:18.075 --> 51:20.338
There can be peace between us
after all.

51:22.905 --> 51:25.125
- The foot doesn't make friends

51:25.169 --> 51:26.735
with the dog shit it steps in.

51:29.956 --> 51:30.913
- I got a question.

51:32.045 --> 51:34.743
If you're so above us,

51:35.788 --> 51:38.312
why bother going after
Rob Reid 20 years ago?

51:39.487 --> 51:41.402
- Because he took her from me.

51:41.446 --> 51:42.316
- Nixx.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.188
- Do not speak her name again.

51:44.231 --> 51:45.493
- Someone's touchy.

51:49.628 --> 51:50.455
- You're right.

51:51.543 --> 51:52.457
I apologize.

51:55.590 --> 51:57.288
Such a petty human emotion.

51:59.464 --> 52:02.684
You see, the more time I spend
inside this human vessel,

52:04.295 --> 52:06.862
the more infected I become
with your little quirks.

52:08.037 --> 52:09.735
- Seems like quite the posse of
humans

52:09.778 --> 52:11.432
you've been hangin' out with,
huh?

52:12.738 --> 52:13.608
- The cult?

52:14.870 --> 52:16.307
Oh, that was Nixx's idea.

52:18.744 --> 52:21.442
You see, when we first
came back to this place,

52:21.486 --> 52:23.401
we were a shadow of our former
selves.

52:25.229 --> 52:28.014
Taking your life force
was the quickest way

52:28.057 --> 52:31.757
for us to get that Friday
feeling again.

52:34.020 --> 52:37.458
Unfortunately, jumping from
body to body leaves a trail

52:37.502 --> 52:38.981
for your agents to follow.

52:40.809 --> 52:42.942
So we decided to start our own
farm.

52:44.248 --> 52:45.336
- How'd that turn out?

52:47.120 --> 52:49.731
- As disappointing as
everything else in this world.

53:03.005 --> 53:05.704
- Okay, they're heading towards
the disused kitchen area.

53:05.747 --> 53:07.793
You can cut them off there.
- Copy that.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.540
- You're gonna have to fight.

53:15.583 --> 53:17.803
- What? No, no, no, I can't.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.023
- Well, we're surrounded, so
you're gonna have to man up.

53:22.982 --> 53:24.810
You take three and I'll take
three.

53:27.595 --> 53:30.816
- How's about you take five
and I take the little one?

53:30.859 --> 53:32.557
- Just go ahead.
- Okay.

53:36.125 --> 53:37.257
- Sorry, guys.

53:37.301 --> 53:38.911
Kitchen's closed.

53:38.954 --> 53:40.347
You'll have to find somewhere
else.

53:41.305 --> 53:43.220
-  I'll get him, kill the
girl.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.637
I'm out of arrows.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.335
- Get out of there and
regroup with the others.

55:25.409 --> 55:26.845
-  Are you okay?

55:29.761 --> 55:30.675
- Did I win?

55:35.027 --> 55:36.811
-  Sixth number
accepted.

55:39.945 --> 55:40.859
- It's bad, right?

55:45.211 --> 55:46.517
- Look on the bright side.

55:48.736 --> 55:51.173
At least your face is still
pretty.

55:52.566 --> 55:56.657
- Tick-tock, tick-tock.

55:56.701 --> 55:58.180
Time is almost up for you.

56:01.096 --> 56:02.881
- Time's almost up for both of
us.

56:05.971 --> 56:07.973
- That's not really true,
though, is it?

56:11.063 --> 56:14.458
See, I might be going on an
extended holiday, but you?

56:16.938 --> 56:18.679
You're going nowhere.

56:19.941 --> 56:21.856
Back to the nothingness you came
from.

56:25.643 --> 56:28.341
- Alright, pal, whatever you
say.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.211
- Ah!

56:30.822 --> 56:31.910
There it is.

56:31.953 --> 56:33.302
- There what is?

56:34.129 --> 56:36.349
- That moment of blind hope in
his eyes.

56:38.264 --> 56:40.484
After everything he
knows about the Universe.

56:42.573 --> 56:43.617
About my kind.

56:45.097 --> 56:47.012
About where your kind comes
from.

56:48.666 --> 56:53.671
In spite of that, he still
thinks that maybe, just maybe,

56:55.324 --> 56:57.022
there's something after this
life.

56:59.198 --> 57:01.548
A light at the end of the
tunnel.

57:08.860 --> 57:09.774
It's pathetic.

57:16.128 --> 57:18.696
- Well, maybe we just keep you
here,

57:18.739 --> 57:21.394
instead of sending you
back to your girlfriend.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.917
Let's see who's laughing then.

57:25.093 --> 57:26.704
- Do you think that might
happen?

57:28.575 --> 57:29.446
Because I don't.

57:32.100 --> 57:33.188
I've seen this moment.

57:34.668 --> 57:35.539
Seen this room.

57:37.497 --> 57:38.933
Seen me and her reunited.

57:40.195 --> 57:41.545
- How?

57:41.588 --> 57:42.459
- I told you.

57:43.895 --> 57:45.418
Time works differently for me.

57:47.594 --> 57:48.856
I think you should be more
concerned

57:48.900 --> 57:51.032
with saying your goodbyes,

57:51.076 --> 57:54.427
before you have to take your
short train ride to oblivion.

58:04.742 --> 58:05.917
-  Fuck him!

58:30.332 --> 58:31.638
-  This area is clear.

58:38.906 --> 58:40.908
For fuck sake.

58:40.952 --> 58:43.520
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

58:56.271 --> 59:01.276
- Ren, can you hear me?

59:05.542 --> 59:07.805
-  I'm still here.

59:07.848 --> 59:11.243
- I was afraid you got yourself
killed.

59:11.286 --> 59:15.595
How're you holdin' up?

59:15.639 --> 59:16.509
Ren?

59:18.032 --> 59:18.859
- Just peachy.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.732
You?

59:21.775 --> 59:23.255
- I've been better.

59:23.298 --> 59:24.473
You still got our guest?

59:28.434 --> 59:30.479
-  He's still in one piece.

59:30.523 --> 59:31.437
At least, for now.

59:33.700 --> 59:36.529
The place is overrun with
some kind of Elder cult.

59:37.661 --> 59:40.577
- We know, they're currently
decoding

59:40.620 --> 59:42.317
the E.L.F in the Deportation
Zone.

59:43.623 --> 59:46.234
It won't be long before they're
in.

59:46.278 --> 59:47.627
- Don't worry.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.150
I'll be in the Blue Zone soon.

59:50.021 --> 59:51.326
Gotta go.

59:51.370 --> 59:52.371
- Listen, Ren, I...

59:55.200 --> 59:56.244
Stay safe, okay?

01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:10.302
- That looks bad.

01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:12.086
- Yeah, it feels bad.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.832
Move your hand.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.709
Yeah, you got a cracked rib.

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:27.536
- Ren?
- That sucks for you.

01:00:41.289 --> 01:00:42.421
Are you okay?

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:45.467
- You know my girlfriend left me
last week

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.121
'cause she said I was "too
safe?"

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.907
Now look at me!

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.778
I'm runnin' round an underground
facility,

01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:53.214
fightin' wannabe ninjas.

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.303
With a cracked rib.

01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:59.743
So I can deport a god.

01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:02.180
So, no, I'm not okay.

01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:08.099
- Well, you know, for
a guy with zero skills,

01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:10.971
and no interest in what he's
been actually

01:01:11.015 --> 01:01:13.104
been doing for a job...

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:16.368
You're alright.

01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.936
- Thanks.

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:23.331
Hey, um...

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:28.554
You know, when this
whole thing blows over,

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:32.558
and if you're not busy and,
you know, doing anything, um...

01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:36.344
Would you like to go for a drink
with me?

01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:41.654
- Never gonna happen.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.222
Oh, I said you were alright, I
didn't say you were dateable.

01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:47.747
- Oh, come on, the hero is
supposed to get the girl.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:50.097
- Dude, you're the sidekick.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:09.203
- Help me.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.303
- Are you okay?

01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:26.655
- I think it's trying
to tell me something.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:27.526
- "It?"

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.442
- It, you know?

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.312
Him.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.967
- Well, what's he tryin' to tell
you?

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:38.929
- I think he wants me to deport
him.

01:02:38.972 --> 01:02:42.149
- Okay, Ker, the deportation
officer and the girl

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:45.805
are headed towards the
Blue Zone, by the gym.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.765
Everyone else who's nearby,
get there now and back her up.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:59.340
-  Access granted.

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:01.690
Electrified Light Field
deactivated.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:23.495
- I saw you.

01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:24.539
He showed you to me.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.021
- So, you're the girl.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.809
Talks about you all the time,
you know.

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:35.812
Really pisses me off.

01:03:38.118 --> 01:03:39.903
You must be the deportation
officer.

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.210
You're coming with me.

01:03:44.646 --> 01:03:47.911
Behave, and I'll let you keep
your feet.

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:51.175
- Sam, go to the deportation
room.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.263
- Where?

01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:54.395
- Two corridors down, turn left,
go.

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:56.093
-  But what--

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:56.963
- Just go!

01:03:58.747 --> 01:03:59.748
- Rude.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.272
I called the dibs.

01:04:01.315 --> 01:04:04.884
-  Here they are,
she's got company, get her!

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.365
-  13th number
accepted.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.324
One number remaining.

01:05:25.356 --> 01:05:26.531
- Now, listen.

01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:29.926
- Time's almost up.

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:32.667
- Fuck you.

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:35.061
- No.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:38.847
He's right.

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:40.675
I'm done.

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.725
- Do you want me to give her a
message?

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.382
- No, I'll do it myself.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.040
You can give her this, though.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:00.869
- Sure.

01:06:05.091 --> 01:06:06.919
- There you go.

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:24.415
- Ren.

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:29.289
I need you to know something
before I go.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:24.953
I need you to know how
proud your dad would've been

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:26.825
of what you've become.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.658
Whatever you do...

01:07:35.964 --> 01:07:37.096
Don't give up.

01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.581
Don't let what happened stop
you.

01:07:43.624 --> 01:07:45.974
- Stop the code now!

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:49.935
- You can fight it.

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:02.078
Earlier on, you...

01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:06.734
You told me I wasn't your
guardian.

01:08:06.778 --> 01:08:07.605
- Help me.

01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:16.483
- And you were right, I'm not.

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:28.800
I'm your family.

01:08:29.714 --> 01:08:31.629
-  Access granted.

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:34.675
Electrified Light Field
deactivated.

01:08:54.826 --> 01:08:56.479
- I'm so sorry, Ren.

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:03.764
- My salvation.

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:07.203
Finally here.

01:10:08.726 --> 01:10:10.858
- Ker, come in.

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:12.469
-  Is she dead?

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:13.339
- She's down.

01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:16.821
-  No, fuck this, I'm out.

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:19.606
I'm not getting caught by
Artemis, I have a family.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.477
- What about Ker?

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.783
-  What about her?

01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:25.133
She's got nothin' to
lose, get out of there.

01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:26.004
It's over.

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:29.616
- Okay, abort.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.836
Everyone find an exit or get
left behind.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:12.093
- So, he can't cross these?

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.007
-  No.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:17.142
Doesn't stop his yapping,
though, sadly.

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:18.012
- Well, well.

01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:21.407
Look at you.

01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:27.283
All these years of communicating
with you

01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:28.588
across time and space.

01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:30.851
And now...

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:33.071
Here you are.

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:36.422
All grown up.

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.382
- My visions, it was you.

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:41.253
- I told you.

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:43.603
We're connected.

01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:45.518
- Why?

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.956
- I see time in fragments.

01:11:49.957 --> 01:11:51.307
Bits and pieces.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:56.399
All those years ago,
when I came to your home,

01:11:58.052 --> 01:12:01.229
I looked at you, and I saw this
day.

01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:05.799
Felt this pain.

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.107
That I feel now.

01:12:10.848 --> 01:12:11.762
And I knew.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:14.460
- Knew what?

01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:18.551
- That one day, you would save
me.

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:21.772
-   Listen.

01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:25.166
For everyone that isn't a
batshit-crazy god, do you just

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.647
wanna tell us what the
fuck you're talking about?

01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:34.088
- When your agents caught
and deported my love,

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.309
I was determined to bring her
back.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.966
So, I returned to our followers,

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:47.841
and I began to drain them at
speed to build up my strength.

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:52.629
But they turned on me.

01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:56.589
Because of her.

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.549
- Sword girl?

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:00.680
- Her name is Ker.

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:05.032
They trapped me in a ward.

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.775
Much like the one I'm
currently standing in.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:12.475
Making me change vessels weekly.

01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:16.000
They believe draining
the blood of my vessel

01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:17.871
and drinking it gives them
power.

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.875
Which is total bullshit, by the
way.

01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:27.054
It is excruciating pain for me,
though.

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.583
I reached out to you many times,
Ren.

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:38.631
But human brains are far too
weak to grasp my true voice.

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:43.201
Yours is stronger than most,
though.

01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:44.724
If that makes you feel better.

01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:48.380
- Hey, so that means you're not
crazy.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.429
- How did you end up here?

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:58.216
- I realized that what I'd
seen when I looked at you

01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:59.435
all those years ago...

01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:03.221
My deportation.

01:14:05.223 --> 01:14:06.354
My reunion with Nixx.

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:10.228
So, I escaped.

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:14.275
And then purposely got
myself caught by your agents.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.453
-  You want to be
deported.

01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:24.416
- I had spent eons over there,
weakened.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.637
Longing to come back.

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:32.511
But now, it would appear this
universe

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:34.687
is not just a cruel joke on your
kind,

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:36.950
but mine, too.

01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:40.911
I see it now, though.

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:44.610
It is this world that is hell.

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:55.752
- You know, I always thought
it was me that was afraid.

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.450
That I was too scared
from seeing the real you

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.799
to live my life properly.

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.109
You say you've been feeling
pain.

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:07.764
But I know you're lying.

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:10.810
It's not pain, is it?

01:15:12.986 --> 01:15:13.857
It's fear.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:18.209
You're scared you're just as
meaningless as the rest of us.

01:15:18.252 --> 01:15:21.299
- Send me back now, and let's
finish this.

01:15:22.474 --> 01:15:25.216
- I could just give you
to Ker and let you suffer.

01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:34.573
- Bad god.

01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:36.880
Who let you off your leash?

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:42.146
-  Prison cell
breached.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:44.452
- Deport me now or I will snap
her neck.

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:45.323
- Do it, Sam.

01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:49.719
- Shut him up.

01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:00.512
- Looks like you're gonna have
to find yourself a new god.

01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:02.340
- I like you.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.821
Shame I have to kill you.

01:16:07.998 --> 01:16:09.695
Might as well die with some
honor.

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:25.450
- How the fuck?

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:29.628
- The illusion of power.

01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:11.208
- Where's your god now?

01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:32.490
Stop!

01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:54.425
-  Prison cell
breached.

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:56.253
- You can't kill me.

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:58.211
Just send me back.
- No.

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:02.738
You said something to me that
night.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:05.828
"I see you.

01:19:07.046 --> 01:19:08.265
"You will see me.

01:19:12.138 --> 01:19:14.967
"Don't you ever forget
my face, motherfucker."

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:05.670
