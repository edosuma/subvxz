00:22.539 --> 00:24.259
Thank you, Lucy, that was delicious.

00:24.260 --> 00:27.579
Pleasure. It's just nice to cook
a proper meal for adults.

00:27.579 --> 00:29.298
The kids are such fussy eaters.

00:29.300 --> 00:33.478
Yes, Anna, how was your gluten-free,
non-lactose, low-carb, organic salad?

00:33.479 --> 00:36.259
Toby's jealous because
I listen to my body.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.820
I have to listen
to Lee's body all the time.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.859
Mummy, I weed the bed.

00:42.859 --> 00:45.899
Oh, good, the after-dinner
speaker's arrived.

00:45.899 --> 00:47.859
Well, are you going to sort it out?

00:47.859 --> 00:50.378
She said, "Mummy, I've weed the bed."

00:50.380 --> 00:51.819
It was me that did it last time.

00:51.820 --> 00:53.539
I know, and I had to clean it up.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.259
Mummy!

00:56.259 --> 00:58.219
Coming!

00:58.219 --> 01:01.338
Typical. Toby doesn't do
anything at home, either.

01:01.340 --> 01:02.459
Sorry?

01:02.460 --> 01:03.658
Oh, come on!

01:03.659 --> 01:05.858
Every time Jack makes
a mess it's always me

01:05.859 --> 01:08.099
who has to tell the nanny to pick it up.

01:08.099 --> 01:11.099
You're too busy gallivanting
with your celebrity friends.

01:11.099 --> 01:13.858
Have you told Lee who you
had dinner with last night?

01:13.859 --> 01:15.099
Who?

01:15.099 --> 01:19.579
Who is the last person you can imagine
Toby enjoying a night out with?

01:22.340 --> 01:23.500
Don't say it.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.299
Emma Bunton.

01:26.299 --> 01:28.618
As in Spice Girl Emma Bunton?

01:28.620 --> 01:32.539
Yeah, the more famous pop rivet
welder Emma Bunton wasn't available.

01:32.539 --> 01:33.778
How come?

01:33.780 --> 01:37.698
Cos a new steel factory
in Rotherham required her services.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.698
We're doing some fundraising
for a new wing at the hospital.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.938
She's become a patron of the charity.

01:42.939 --> 01:44.459
She's very nice, actually.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.978
I know she's very nice. You
don't have to tell me.

01:46.979 --> 01:49.218
She was always the sexiest Spice Girl.

01:49.219 --> 01:52.058
She's just so... feminine.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.819
They were all feminine.

01:53.819 --> 01:57.378
Come on! Two of them are called Mel
and the other two are Vic and Geri.

01:57.379 --> 02:00.218
They'd have been a darts
team if it wasn't for Emma.

02:00.219 --> 02:02.899
She's amazing. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

02:02.900 --> 02:03.978
You're met her.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.179
I suppose so. She's not really my type.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.900
That's true. You usually
go for posh and scary.

02:11.979 --> 02:16.899
Are we to take it that Emma Bunton
is your hot tub fantasy date, Lee?

02:16.900 --> 02:18.139
Oh, here we go.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.378
Oh, stop being so boring.

02:19.379 --> 02:21.378
It's only a bit of harmless fun.

02:21.379 --> 02:25.378
So, the way it works is you
get to choose one celebrity

02:25.379 --> 02:28.739
to spend a fantasy evening
with in a hot tub.

02:28.740 --> 02:31.938
So, for me it would be Tom Hardy.

02:31.939 --> 02:34.058
I thought it was Brad Pitt.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.418
It was Brad Pitt. Now it's Tom Hardy.

02:36.420 --> 02:40.418
Just me and Tom and a bottle of bubbly.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.938
Oh, and maybe I'd need some handcuffs.

02:42.939 --> 02:44.778
You'd definitely need some handcuffs,

02:44.780 --> 02:47.539
or at the very least
something to sedate him.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.538
Toby's just jealous because every time
we play I'm always able

02:52.539 --> 02:54.179
to think of new exciting people,

02:54.180 --> 02:57.299
and he always says the same
boring old answer.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.338
Who?

02:58.340 --> 03:00.899
I find this whole game rather
distasteful, to be honest.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.658
- Come on. Who?
- There's something rather tawdry...

03:03.659 --> 03:05.459
Tell him.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.860
Susie Dent
from Countdown's Dictionary Corner.

03:09.860 --> 03:11.179
Nothing untoward.

03:11.180 --> 03:13.459
Just a bit of stimulating chat.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.538
You're supposed to be
having sex with her, Toby.

03:15.539 --> 03:17.378
Actually, as a medical professional,

03:17.379 --> 03:21.139
I would advise strongly against having
intercourse in a hot tub.

03:21.139 --> 03:24.338
It's a breeding ground
for Legionnaires' disease.

03:24.340 --> 03:27.338
Well, I wouldn't waste any time
chatting with Tom Hardy,

03:27.340 --> 03:28.378
let me tell you.

03:28.379 --> 03:30.740
Oh, he doesn't know what he's missing.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.459
I bet Lee wouldn't be
talking to Emma Bunton.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.179
Damn right we wouldn't be talking.

03:37.180 --> 03:40.819
And if we were, it'd just be sweet
nothings and romantic small talk.

03:40.819 --> 03:42.658
There's a pile of wet sheets in the bath.

03:42.659 --> 03:44.299
They stink of pee and so does Molly.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.259
And I'm back in the room.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.739
We've just been playing a game with Lee.

03:48.740 --> 03:52.299
You pick someone to have a romantic
evening in a hot tub with,

03:52.300 --> 03:53.778
and it's your turn.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.699
Oh! Who did you pick?

03:55.699 --> 03:56.739
You first.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.938
Well, obviously me
first, but who after me?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.618
Come on. Who? I won't be offended.

04:00.620 --> 04:01.938
It's just a game.

04:01.939 --> 04:06.539
Um... Well, I suppose if I have
to say, then I would pick...

04:07.860 --> 04:10.699
...Michael Lorenzo.

04:10.699 --> 04:11.818
Who?

04:11.819 --> 04:14.099
Oh, you won't know him. He's my dentist.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.019
Can't choose your dentist.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.059
Why not?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.619
It's supposed to be a celebrity.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.060
Oh.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.939
Mine would be Hugh Jackman.

04:26.939 --> 04:28.899
You just said Tom Hardy!

04:28.899 --> 04:30.499
And now I'm saying Hugh Jackman.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.779
It doesn't mean Tom Hardy has to get out.

04:34.139 --> 04:35.939
So who did you choose?

04:35.939 --> 04:37.579
Emma Bunton.

04:37.579 --> 04:40.298
Oh, good choice. She's a very
attractive woman.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.978
Oh, yeah, it's easy to be unbothered
when it's someone famous.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.137
You'd feel differently
if it was someone I knew.

04:45.163 --> 04:46.019
No, I wouldn't.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.499
All right, I want to change my mind.
Forget Emma Bunton.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.500
I want to spend the night
in a hot tub with... Anna.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.139
You'd be lucky to find any room.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.819 --> 05:06.379
So what does he look like, then?

05:06.379 --> 05:07.538
Who?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.538
You know who.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.939
Oh, I don't know. Like a dentist.

05:11.939 --> 05:14.218
Bit older than me. Grey hair.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.418
The boyfriend you had before me
was older with grey hair,

05:17.420 --> 05:19.459
and you fancied him.

05:19.459 --> 05:22.459
I'm just saying you should
have chosen a celebrity.

05:22.459 --> 05:24.298
OK, fine.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.738
I'd love to lie naked in a hot
tub with George Clooney.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.738
Then we can dry off and he can
give me both barrels

05:30.740 --> 05:33.778
on a rug in front of a fire
in an isolated crofter's cottage

05:33.779 --> 05:37.819
in the Highlands, pushing my buttons
like I'm an espresso machine.

05:37.819 --> 05:38.939
Happy now?

05:40.259 --> 05:43.699
Interesting. Clooney. Older. Grey hair.

05:43.699 --> 05:45.858
Just like your dentist.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.858
Only you don't go and see
George Clooney all the time.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.939
I have to go and see my dentist.

05:50.939 --> 05:52.418
It's called a check-up.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.738
Oh, come on. Who goes
for a check-up every six months?

05:55.740 --> 05:58.098
The hell has got into you?

05:58.100 --> 06:00.619
I'm completely fine about you
choosing Emma Bunting.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.738
It's Bunton, not Bunting.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.939
She's a Spice Girl, not a street party.

06:06.139 --> 06:09.098
And that is completely different
because I've never met her.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.459
Don't look at me like that.

06:10.459 --> 06:13.298
I know loads of blokes who wouldn't
be happy about their wife

06:13.300 --> 06:15.218
fantasising about seeing their dentist.

06:15.220 --> 06:19.019
I do not. I sometimes fantasise
about you seeing the dentist.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.819
Well, I might just do that.
Check him out for myself.

06:22.819 --> 06:25.100
I'm going to book an appointment
first thing in the morning.

06:25.124 --> 06:25.858
Fine.

06:25.860 --> 06:27.658
And while you're at it, I've also got

06:27.660 --> 06:30.500
a crush on the gym owner
and anyone who trims nasal hair.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.812
Mind how you go.

06:48.346 --> 06:50.706
You can book your next check-up
at reception.

06:50.706 --> 06:52.066
Thank you.

06:51.627 --> 06:53.387
Hello. Come on in.

06:53.387 --> 06:55.627
Thanks.

06:55.627 --> 06:57.307
Make yourself comfortable.

07:01.028 --> 07:04.826
I'm so sorry. How embarrassing.

07:04.827 --> 07:09.547
It's fine. It's really,
really, really fine.

07:09.548 --> 07:11.466
I apologise for the aroma.

07:11.468 --> 07:13.786
I'm not allowed to eat garlic at home.

07:13.788 --> 07:15.348
My boyfriend hates it.

07:16.507 --> 07:18.026
You know what?

07:18.028 --> 07:21.547
I'm not usually keen on coming
to the dentist, but I like you.

07:21.548 --> 07:22.706
Thank you.

07:22.707 --> 07:25.106
But I'm afraid you won't
actually be seeing me today.

07:25.108 --> 07:27.266
I was just filling
in for his last patient.

07:27.268 --> 07:30.108
You'll be seeing my colleague Michael.
Michael Lorenzo.

07:32.187 --> 07:34.187
Talk of the devil.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.747
But he's beautiful!

07:38.268 --> 07:40.307
Thanks, big guy. I owe you.

07:40.307 --> 07:42.067
OK, let's have a look.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.867
So, why haven't we seen you here before?

07:44.867 --> 07:46.387
Well, my wife makes up for it.

07:46.387 --> 07:48.106
She's a season ticket holder.

07:48.108 --> 07:49.987
Hang on. Your wife.

07:49.987 --> 07:51.226
She's not Lucy, is she?

07:51.228 --> 07:52.387
Yeah.

07:52.387 --> 07:56.947
I thought I recognised your surname.
Yeah, Lucy. Lovely girl.

07:56.947 --> 07:59.387
Never said she was married, though.

07:59.387 --> 08:00.987
OK.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.988
First check-up in several years.

08:04.990 --> 08:07.468
Who's a naughty boy, then?

08:07.470 --> 08:09.550
You tell me.

08:13.923 --> 08:16.322
Two fillings. What a con.

08:16.324 --> 08:18.082
He's just trying to make a few quid.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.562
Nothing wrong with my teeth.

08:19.564 --> 08:20.643
Sugar?

08:20.644 --> 08:22.362
Yeah, three.

08:22.363 --> 08:25.843
You know, it's quite common
for people to fantasise about

08:25.843 --> 08:29.562
their dentists, nurses, surgeons.

08:29.564 --> 08:32.682
When I was a doctor at Moorfields,
several patients had crushes on me.

08:32.683 --> 08:35.082
Moorfields, the eye hospital?

08:35.083 --> 08:40.403
Yeah. But you picked Emma Bunton.
She picked the dentist.

08:40.403 --> 08:41.682
What's the difference?

08:41.683 --> 08:44.043
There is a huge difference,
and well you know it.

08:44.043 --> 08:46.842
In fact, I reckon that's the exact
reason you chose Susie Dent.

08:46.844 --> 08:47.883
What?

08:47.884 --> 08:50.283
You chose her because you
know you'll never meet her,

08:50.283 --> 08:52.283
so it's a safe bet to say
it in front of Anna.

08:52.283 --> 08:57.962
It's the exact same reason Anna
chose Tom Hardy and Hugh Jackman.

08:57.963 --> 09:00.403
- And Brad Pitt.
- Exactly.

09:00.403 --> 09:06.003
And Daniel Craig, Damien
Lewis, and Antonio Banderas,

09:06.004 --> 09:10.562
and Michael Fassbender, and Rob Lowe...

09:10.563 --> 09:11.763
The point is...

09:11.764 --> 09:16.523
...and Christian Bale, and Jude
Law, and Russell Crowe,

09:16.524 --> 09:18.682
and Leonardo DiCaprio...

09:18.683 --> 09:20.682
Exactly. She chose them because...

09:20.683 --> 09:23.682
Kevin Costner, Daniel Day-Lewis...

09:23.683 --> 09:25.003
How long is this list?

09:25.004 --> 09:27.163
Oh, it's quite long. Yeah.

09:27.163 --> 09:30.523
Ends with Chas and Dave and the tall
one from the Chuckle Brothers.

09:30.524 --> 09:33.082
Point is, you're both playing
safe cos you'll never meet

09:33.084 --> 09:36.163
any of these people. Trust me,
you'd both think differently if it was

09:36.163 --> 09:39.442
somebody you knew, because
it's against the rules if you know them.

09:39.443 --> 09:40.802
Well, there's your answer, then.

09:40.803 --> 09:43.682
If you want Lucy to see things
from your point of view you need

09:43.683 --> 09:46.442
to become a member of the Spice
Girls and get to know Emma Bunton.

09:46.443 --> 09:47.883
Don't worry.

09:47.884 --> 09:50.003
You wouldn't clash
with any of them on stage,

09:50.004 --> 09:52.003
cos you're not ginger, you're not sporty,

09:52.004 --> 09:56.442
you're not particularly scary,
and you're definitely not posh.

09:56.443 --> 09:59.322
Although you do act a bit like a baby.

09:59.323 --> 10:01.163
Hang on, you're onto something here.

10:01.163 --> 10:04.442
If I could get to meet Emma Bunton I'd be
on a level playing field with Lucy.

10:04.443 --> 10:05.883
When are you next seeing her?

10:05.884 --> 10:08.643
Well, there's a fundraiser
this weekend, but...

10:08.644 --> 10:10.722
I can't just invite
people in off the street,

10:10.724 --> 10:12.842
and even if I could, I wouldn't ask you.

10:12.844 --> 10:17.243
I'd rather invite...
people in off the street.

10:17.244 --> 10:20.363
Please, Toby. I've got
a point to prove here.

10:20.364 --> 10:22.083
Oh, God.

10:23.364 --> 10:26.482
Can't you just make my life
simple and do your other idea?

10:26.484 --> 10:28.764
Have sex with my wife.

10:37.393 --> 10:39.231
You look smart, Lee.

10:39.232 --> 10:41.033
Are McDonald's interviewing?

10:42.513 --> 10:44.511
So, today's the big day, hey?

10:44.513 --> 10:45.751
Yup.

10:45.753 --> 10:47.951
Do you think you'll actually
get to talk to her?

10:47.952 --> 10:49.152
Who?

10:49.153 --> 10:50.471
You know who.

10:50.472 --> 10:52.672
Maybe. Why? Does it bother you?

10:52.673 --> 10:55.951
Not in the slightest. I am
genuinely pleased for you, Lee.

10:55.952 --> 10:57.152
Is that right?

10:57.153 --> 10:59.513
Am I not reacting the way you want?

11:06.793 --> 11:08.392
What do you want me to say, Lee?

11:08.393 --> 11:10.711
Can you please say that again,
just one more time?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.272
What do you want?

11:12.273 --> 11:14.792
♪ Yo I'll tell you what I want,
what I really, really want ♪

11:14.793 --> 11:16.991
♪ So tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

11:16.993 --> 11:19.192
♪ I'll tell you what I want,
what I really, really want ♪

11:19.192 --> 11:21.432
♪ So tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

11:21.432 --> 11:23.672
♪ I wanna (ha) I wanna (ha)
I wanna (ha) I wanna (ha) ♪

11:23.673 --> 11:26.592
♪ I wanna really, really,
really wanna zigazig ah. ♪

11:34.832 --> 11:37.152
That is so childish.

11:37.153 --> 11:39.272
I can't believe he's bothering to goad you

11:39.273 --> 11:41.591
when it's so clear it's having
absolutely no effect.

11:41.592 --> 11:42.871
I know!

11:42.873 --> 11:44.831
As if I'd be bothered about Emma Bunton,

11:44.832 --> 11:48.231
even if she is "so feminine".

11:48.232 --> 11:50.272
How do you know he said that about her?

11:50.273 --> 11:53.072
You were upstairs changing
the bedsheets when he said that.

11:53.072 --> 11:55.032
Was I?

11:55.033 --> 11:58.591
Well, Lee's voice travels in this house.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.913
It hitches a ride with the smell.

12:01.993 --> 12:05.552
So, how come you didn't also
hear that the rules of the game

12:05.552 --> 12:07.912
are you have to pick someone famous?

12:07.913 --> 12:09.991
OK, I heard everything, all right?

12:09.993 --> 12:12.445
About how he wants
to whisper sweet nothings

12:12.470 --> 12:14.951
in gorgeous Emma
Bunton's ear, and I thought,

12:14.952 --> 12:19.032
"Right, well, two can play at that game,"
so I decided to go one better

12:19.033 --> 12:22.912
and choose someone who was not
only good-looking but that I also knew.

12:22.913 --> 12:27.152
You deliberately made him jealous.
You're as bad as each other.

12:27.153 --> 12:28.272
So?

12:28.273 --> 12:31.513
It worked, and it got him
to go to the dentist.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.312
This is all very pleasant, isn't it?

12:42.312 --> 12:44.111
Let's keep it that way, yeah?

12:44.113 --> 12:46.471
Don't worry. I'm not
going to embarrass you.

12:46.472 --> 12:47.993
Are they free?

12:51.952 --> 12:54.511
Oh, my God. There she is.
There's Emma Bunton.

12:54.513 --> 12:57.392
That's really her, right? It's not
just one of those lookalikes.

12:57.393 --> 12:58.991
Maybe we should ask her to sing.

12:58.993 --> 13:02.232
If she can do it, we'll know
it's not a real Spice Girl.

13:03.352 --> 13:05.591
What should I say to her when I meet her?

13:05.592 --> 13:09.432
She's just a normal person
who likes normal conversations

13:09.432 --> 13:11.511
and has a normal sense of humour.

13:11.513 --> 13:13.511
So you're saying I should
just crack a few jokes?

13:13.513 --> 13:16.272
I am absolutely not saying that.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.511
So what should I say, then?

13:17.513 --> 13:19.072
Just don't say anything too...

13:19.072 --> 13:21.312
Don't say anything too what?

13:21.312 --> 13:24.393
Just don't say anything to... her.

13:25.712 --> 13:27.032
No chance.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.951
I'm getting a selfie with the Bunts
and I'm going to send it to Lucy

13:29.952 --> 13:32.631
and wind my wife
up like a clockwork monkey.

13:32.633 --> 13:34.951
At least you're winding
your women up nowadays.

13:34.952 --> 13:36.393
You used to just blow them up.

13:38.472 --> 13:42.993
And thank you again. £20,000
will make such a huge difference.

13:44.592 --> 13:45.792
Toby!

13:45.793 --> 13:48.192
- Emma.
- Lovely to see you again.

13:48.192 --> 13:49.672
One kiss or two?

13:49.673 --> 13:51.111
Let's do it the French way.

13:51.113 --> 13:52.513
You have got to be kidding me!

13:54.952 --> 13:56.513
Hi, Lee, I'm Emma.

13:59.513 --> 14:00.991
I mean, you're Emma.

14:00.993 --> 14:04.192
Emma Bunton, the most amazing
and most beautiful,

14:04.192 --> 14:06.991
talented singer in the whole
of the Spice Girls.

14:06.993 --> 14:10.152
Anyway, Emma's got
some charity mugging to do,

14:10.153 --> 14:12.111
so we should probably let her mingle.

14:12.113 --> 14:14.792
She is mingling, with me,
a potential donor.

14:14.793 --> 14:18.033
I'm the minglee, she's the minger...
mingler.

14:20.113 --> 14:21.631
Come on.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.871
You go. I'll be over in a second.

14:23.873 --> 14:26.432
I just want to get a selfie
with Emma, if that's all right.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.152
Always happy to help the donors.

14:28.153 --> 14:30.991
Thanks. My wife is going to be so jealous.

14:30.993 --> 14:33.831
She loves you almost as much
as going to the dentist.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.393
Nice.

14:37.712 --> 14:40.232
Better get close.
I've got very short arms.

14:42.552 --> 14:43.993
Closer.

14:47.393 --> 14:49.631
What do you think? Is
that a bit compromising?

14:49.633 --> 14:50.831
No, of course not.

14:50.832 --> 14:53.111
You're right, it's rubbish.
Let's do another.

14:53.113 --> 14:55.152
Actually, can I ask you
a cheeky favour, Emma?

14:55.153 --> 14:58.231
Is there any chance
of a little kiss on the cheek?

14:58.232 --> 14:59.511
Er, well...

14:59.513 --> 15:01.072
Come on, think of the sick kiddies.

15:02.432 --> 15:04.513
How much are you donating?

15:05.633 --> 15:07.032
Five?

15:07.033 --> 15:08.471
5,000?

15:08.472 --> 15:11.152
Well, yeah, if you mean 5,000 pence.

15:11.153 --> 15:12.792
That's £50.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.352
Is it? I thought it was a fiver.

15:16.913 --> 15:19.231
All right, £50.

15:19.232 --> 15:22.192
Well, seeing as you're
a friend of Toby's...

15:22.192 --> 15:24.072
Thanks.

15:24.072 --> 15:26.033
Three, two, one...

15:27.873 --> 15:30.232
Mmm!

15:32.232 --> 15:33.951
That is brilliant.

15:33.952 --> 15:35.751
I can't wait for my wife to see this.

15:35.753 --> 15:38.032
That is the best £50 I have ever spent.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.832
You were robbed, mate.

15:41.873 --> 15:44.032
Look, it's not just
that he's meeting Emma Bunton.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.912
It's the fact that he's spent
all week trying to wind me up,

15:46.913 --> 15:48.272
doing stupid little things.

15:48.273 --> 15:49.631
Like what?

15:49.633 --> 15:53.032
["Spice Up Your Life" by The Spice Girls]

15:53.033 --> 15:55.792
Like changing my ring tone.

15:55.793 --> 15:58.511
Oh, it's a text from Lee.

15:58.513 --> 16:00.033
What the...?

16:02.913 --> 16:04.831
Blimey. Fast mover.

16:04.832 --> 16:08.672
Toby would still be asking Susie
Dent her favourite preposition.

16:08.673 --> 16:09.991
I'm going to kill him.

16:09.993 --> 16:11.991
Lucy, think for a moment.

16:11.993 --> 16:14.393
If you grind him down for long
enough he'll kill himself.

16:16.592 --> 16:19.272
Maybe you should calm
down before you phone him.

16:19.273 --> 16:22.312
Oh, I'm not phoning Lee.
That'll play right into his hands.

16:22.312 --> 16:23.912
Hello?

16:23.913 --> 16:28.111
I need to book an immediate appointment
to see Michael Lorenzo, please.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.712
Tell him fun-time Lucy needs
an emergency drilling.

16:33.673 --> 16:35.312
Yeah, I never go to the doctor's, me.

16:35.312 --> 16:37.951
Fit as a fiddle. Never get
ill, never catch anything.

16:37.952 --> 16:39.991
Well, just the occasional cold sore.

16:39.993 --> 16:44.592
Anyway, it's, er, been lovely chatting.
I'll see you later.

16:47.952 --> 16:50.392
You got your selfie, then. I saw you.

16:50.393 --> 16:53.432
It was like watching an octopus
eating a Barbie doll.

16:55.033 --> 16:57.951
Yeah, well, it didn't work, did it?
Lucy still hasn't responded.

16:57.952 --> 16:59.111
Well, never mind.

16:59.113 --> 17:02.871
Let's see if we can get you
into a threesome with Mel B and Mel C,

17:02.873 --> 17:04.113
cause a "Mel A."

17:06.913 --> 17:10.271
Save the wordplay crap in case
you ever meet Susie Dent.

17:20.992 --> 17:22.832
I'm so sorry for wasting your time.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.070
Lucy, you never waste my time.

17:25.073 --> 17:28.031
The pain was probably just a bit
of food that got lodged in your tooth.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.073
Have a rinse.

17:30.432 --> 17:32.633
I saw your husband this week.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.031
You never mentioned you were married.

17:36.032 --> 17:37.592
Well, it's not really a marriage.

17:37.593 --> 17:40.313
It's more like a murder-suicide
pact with jewellery.

17:42.393 --> 17:45.711
Actually, Michael, before I go,
can I ask you a favour?

17:45.712 --> 17:47.311
Anything you like, Lucy.

17:47.313 --> 17:50.112
I know it's really silly,
but I've got this friend who's got

17:50.113 --> 17:52.551
a thing for men in white coats,
so we've got this sort of

17:52.552 --> 17:56.072
competition going, who can get the best
selfie with a white-coated man.

17:56.073 --> 17:57.791
- Sounds fun.
- It is.

17:57.792 --> 18:02.231
The best I've managed so far is a painter
and decorator and two beekeepers.

18:02.232 --> 18:06.392
Funny thing is, I ended up getting
stung by the painter and decorator.

18:06.393 --> 18:08.791
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Oh!

18:08.792 --> 18:10.632
Oh, what am I like?

18:10.633 --> 18:12.791
So, um, could I...?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.592
Well, of course. Get over here.

18:15.593 --> 18:18.711
Well, actually, why don't you,
er, get on the chair with me,

18:18.712 --> 18:19.873
you know, bit of fun?

18:22.432 --> 18:26.352
Here we go! Scream if you
want to go faster.

18:26.353 --> 18:29.711
And smile for the camera.

18:29.712 --> 18:32.153
Great. See you in six months.

18:40.192 --> 18:43.112
Well, this afternoon has
been extremely successful.

18:43.113 --> 18:46.072
Today's offer of donations
alone will pay for

18:46.073 --> 18:49.711
a waiting area for the new wing,
and thanks to your offer we can

18:49.712 --> 18:52.472
now afford to put
a few magazines in there, too.

18:53.712 --> 18:55.791
It's not been a complete success, has it?

18:55.792 --> 18:57.432
Lucy still hasn't texted back.

18:57.432 --> 18:58.751
Oh, grow up, Lee.

18:58.752 --> 19:01.791
There's no time for petty
little jealousies in a marriage.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.832
That is rich coming
from a man who had to make up

19:03.833 --> 19:06.192
a hot tub fantasy just to stop
his wife getting jealous.

19:06.192 --> 19:08.551
You still think that's why
I picked Susie Dent,

19:08.553 --> 19:10.392
because really I fancy Emma Bunton?

19:10.393 --> 19:12.511
Of course it is. You've seen
how sexy Emma is,

19:12.512 --> 19:15.711
but you can't admit it to Anna
because you personally know Emma.

19:15.712 --> 19:17.632
I didn't pick Emma cos I don't fancy her.

19:17.633 --> 19:20.551
Course you fancy her. She's Emma
Bunton, for God's sake!

19:20.553 --> 19:23.313
She was grown in a laboratory
out of kittens and boobs.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.872
- A-ha-ha.
- At last, a text from Lucy.

19:28.873 --> 19:30.633
I knew it would work.

19:33.353 --> 19:35.352
Is that a painter and decorator?

19:35.353 --> 19:38.352
It's not a painter and decorator.
It's a dentist.

19:38.353 --> 19:41.711
And I assume from your reaction
that's Michael Lorenzo.

19:41.712 --> 19:44.471
Yes, because when she sends me
pictures of her rolling round

19:44.472 --> 19:47.432
with other dentists, I'm
perfectly fine about it.

19:47.432 --> 19:49.511
What the hell are they doing?

19:49.512 --> 19:52.751
Maybe he's trying a novel way
to get her to say, "Ah."

19:52.752 --> 19:56.432
Oh, come on. It's perfectly
obvious what she's doing.

19:56.432 --> 19:58.672
She's getting her own back,
and I don't blame her.

19:58.673 --> 20:00.791
It's exactly the same as you did to her.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.912
No, it's not. This is a lot worse.

20:02.913 --> 20:05.071
Well, I'm not taking it lying down.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.192
She is.

20:07.952 --> 20:10.951
Ah, here she is. Emma, thank
you so much for today.

20:10.952 --> 20:12.031
You were great.

20:12.032 --> 20:13.872
Can I, er, arrange a car for you?

20:13.873 --> 20:15.271
Oh, there's no need.

20:15.272 --> 20:17.672
I'm going to hang out at the hotel spa,

20:17.673 --> 20:19.711
maybe soak in the hot tub for a bit.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.192
I'll see you later.

20:25.712 --> 20:27.393
Don't even think about it.

20:36.353 --> 20:37.633
Hello!

20:40.712 --> 20:43.353
It's not me making those
bubbles, by the way.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.912
You know what, Emma, whilst you're here,

20:47.913 --> 20:51.311
I don't suppose I could ask
one final favour, could I?

20:51.313 --> 20:53.672
I don't think you should
be in here with a camera.

20:53.673 --> 20:55.031
Oh, I take it with me everywhere.

20:55.032 --> 20:57.632
You never know when you're going
to meet a famous celebrity.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.271
I've had 'em all, me - Elton
John outside Wembley Arena,

21:00.272 --> 21:03.512
Ant and Dec at the Brits,
Chesney Hawkes at Aldi.

21:05.873 --> 21:10.511
Go on, one quick selfie then I promise I'll go
away and leave you alone to... broil.

21:10.512 --> 21:12.872
This is definitely the last one.

21:12.873 --> 21:13.912
Definitely.

21:13.913 --> 21:15.632
No sudden lip action.

21:15.633 --> 21:18.393
None. No diving, no
bombing, no heavy petting.

21:19.992 --> 21:21.872
OK. Make it quick.

21:21.873 --> 21:23.511
Oh, thanks, Emma.

21:23.512 --> 21:26.551
You were always my favourite,
the real talent, the Ken Barlow.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.632
What?

21:27.633 --> 21:31.271
I mean Gary. OK, here we go.

21:31.272 --> 21:32.353
Three, two...

21:34.192 --> 21:35.751
Is that all right?

21:35.752 --> 21:37.792
Well, at least I can see where it is.

21:39.113 --> 21:40.153
One.

21:41.512 --> 21:43.112
Perfect!

21:43.113 --> 21:45.711
Right. See how you like these onions.

21:45.712 --> 21:47.751
Where are you sending that?

21:47.752 --> 21:52.711
Nowhere, honest. This is just
for my own personal private use.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.712
That's reassuring.

21:56.593 --> 21:59.231
You didn't have to wait
and drive me home, Anna.

21:59.232 --> 22:02.711
It's fine. Anything to get
a glimpse of Mikey the dentist.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.633
He's got a bit of a wicked
glint in his eye.

22:06.792 --> 22:10.352
I wonder if he's seen
Fifty Shades Of Grey.

22:10.353 --> 22:12.112
Only when he looked at Lee's teeth.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.231
Oh, here we go.

22:15.232 --> 22:17.712
I knew it wouldn't be long
before he took the bait.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.311
This charity event - where is it?

22:25.313 --> 22:27.632
It's just round the corner
from here, actually.

22:27.633 --> 22:30.511
Can you take me there, please?
And quickly.

22:30.512 --> 22:32.192
Lee's about to drown.

22:35.113 --> 22:37.112
I thought you said you were getting out.

22:37.113 --> 22:39.152
Will in a minute. Just
waiting for something.

22:39.153 --> 22:44.112
Can't you just think of John McCririck
and wrap a towel round you?

22:44.113 --> 22:47.231
Thought I'd find you here. Get out.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.751
Don't listen to him, Emma.

22:48.752 --> 22:50.872
You've got as much right
to be here as the next man.

22:50.873 --> 22:52.311
Get out.

22:52.313 --> 22:54.511
What, so you can take my place?

22:54.512 --> 22:56.912
I knew that dictionary
woman was a cover story.

22:56.913 --> 22:58.551
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

22:58.552 --> 23:02.432
Or as Susie Dent would say,
a charcoal-shaded equine quadruped.

23:03.432 --> 23:04.912
Will you please leave?

23:04.913 --> 23:07.632
By that look on your face
you've clearly got what you were after.

23:07.633 --> 23:09.152
I beg your pardon?

23:09.153 --> 23:10.471
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.551
What did you mean?

23:11.553 --> 23:14.152
I mean, he only asked me
to invite him here today

23:14.153 --> 23:16.751
so he could meet you
to get his wife jealous.

23:16.752 --> 23:18.353
Then why did you invite him?

23:19.393 --> 23:21.112
She's got a point.

23:21.113 --> 23:25.551
Sorry, how come this has suddenly
turned into me being the problem?

23:25.553 --> 23:29.632
Because I came here today to help
raise funds for a hospital wing,

23:29.633 --> 23:32.951
not to impress your groupie mates.

23:32.952 --> 23:35.832
Yeah, all right, big head.
I'm not a groupie.

23:35.833 --> 23:38.432
I'm here for the music,
not just the Spice Girls.

23:38.432 --> 23:41.633
I move with the times.
I've got other cassettes.

23:44.032 --> 23:48.112
Oh! Hello, love. What a nice surprise.

23:48.113 --> 23:51.112
Me and Emma were just
about to order champagne.

23:51.113 --> 23:52.711
Er, no, we weren't.

23:52.712 --> 23:54.313
She prefers Babycham.

23:55.752 --> 23:57.632
What the hell are you doing here?

23:57.633 --> 23:58.991
What the hell am I doing here?

23:58.992 --> 24:01.071
What the hell am I doing here?

24:01.073 --> 24:04.231
What the hell were you doing
at the dentist, again?

24:04.232 --> 24:07.031
Lee, will you please show some dignity?

24:07.032 --> 24:08.633
I've got dignity!

24:11.792 --> 24:13.833
Eyes off the prize, Bunton.

24:18.192 --> 24:19.991
Well done.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.152
Why is everyone suddenly
having a go at me?

24:22.153 --> 24:24.311
Because you should never have invited him!

24:24.313 --> 24:25.912
You never invite me to these things.

24:25.913 --> 24:27.912
You should have just said no to him.

24:27.913 --> 24:31.231
Especially given you
knew what he was up to.

24:31.232 --> 24:33.192
Yeah, Toby.

24:33.192 --> 24:35.192
I've had enough of this.

24:35.192 --> 24:37.152
Well, if you can't beat 'em...

24:37.153 --> 24:38.271
Happy now?

24:38.272 --> 24:39.352
You started it.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.632
No, I didn't.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.352
Well, you sort of did, Lucy.

24:42.353 --> 24:45.711
You should have just said Brad Pitt,
or Tom Hardy, or Hugh Jackman,

24:45.712 --> 24:47.313
or Daniel Craig.

24:48.833 --> 24:50.854
I can't believe you're blaming me.

24:50.878 --> 24:53.192
You shouldn't have started playing
the stupid game in the first place.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.511
Don't start on me, Lucy.

24:54.512 --> 24:56.751
This is both your faults, nobody else's.

24:56.752 --> 24:59.192
Well, maybe Toby's,
but I'll deal with him later.

24:59.192 --> 25:02.112
Just me, or will the whole
of Hollywood be there?

25:02.113 --> 25:04.791
You're a couple of silly,
little, immature children,

25:04.792 --> 25:06.632
with stupid, petty jealousies.

25:06.633 --> 25:08.952
You should be ashamed
of yourselves, both of you.

25:10.952 --> 25:12.833
Hi there, Toby. Mind if I join you?

25:17.393 --> 25:20.392
Sorry I couldn't get to say
hello at the function.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.271
I got cornered by a crazy fan.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.792
You know what they can be like.

25:27.472 --> 25:30.152
This is my wife, Anna.

25:30.153 --> 25:35.192
Anna, I'd like you to meet
another of our charity patrons,

25:35.192 --> 25:38.632
Susie Dent, from Countdown.

25:38.633 --> 25:39.833
Hello.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.873
You never told me you were married.

25:45.073 --> 25:46.872
Didn't I?

26:01.553 --> 26:04.791
I didn't really fancy Emma
Bunton that much in real life.

26:04.792 --> 26:06.032
Bit offish.

26:07.472 --> 26:10.751
Well, you know what they say
never meet your heroes...

26:10.752 --> 26:13.432
in a giant bathtub, in your underpants.

26:14.633 --> 26:17.511
They never want to talk
to the little people.

26:17.512 --> 26:21.392
Yeah, all right. That hot tub
was colder than it looked.

26:21.393 --> 26:23.592
You know there's nothing going on

26:23.593 --> 26:26.551
- between Toby and Susie Dent, don't you?
- Course I do.

26:26.553 --> 26:31.231
So does Anna, but she's still not happy
he's lived out his hot tub fantasy.

26:31.232 --> 26:33.624
I don't think his fantasy involved
Anna jumping in the water

26:33.648 --> 26:35.957
and dragging him out by the hyperboles.

26:37.393 --> 26:40.031
I'm changing dentists, by the way.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.392
You don't need to, honestly.

26:42.393 --> 26:43.832
No, I want to.

26:43.833 --> 26:44.872
He's a bit too flirty,

26:44.873 --> 26:47.432
and I don't like where
he's been putting his hands.

26:47.432 --> 26:48.632
Where?

26:48.633 --> 26:49.873
In your mouth.

26:51.673 --> 26:52.991
I'm sorry, Lucy.

26:52.992 --> 26:54.153
Me, too.

26:55.272 --> 26:56.872
Sleep well.

26:56.873 --> 26:58.472
And you.

27:02.113 --> 27:06.392
I tell you what - that Susie
Dent looked good in a swimsuit.

27:06.393 --> 27:07.633
Ow!
