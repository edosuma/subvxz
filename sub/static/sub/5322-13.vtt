WEBVTT

00:03.006 --> 00:04.781
You know what makes me really mad?

00:04.962 --> 00:07.424
Racism? Classism?

00:07.740 --> 00:09.290
I don't know any more isms.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.425
I didn't get the promotion.

00:11.742 --> 00:15.162
They gave it to a guy, of course,
who's been there half the time I have.

00:15.214 --> 00:17.680
I bet he's only half as qualified too.

00:17.681 --> 00:19.437
That's sexism. (Gasps)

00:19.512 --> 00:21.051
Another ism.

00:21.387 --> 00:22.987
Gabi, I'm really upset.

00:23.299 --> 00:25.687
Sofia, if you feel that way
then you should just quit.

00:25.892 --> 00:28.418
- I did.
- What?

00:29.762 --> 00:31.406
How are we gonna pay our bills?

00:31.407 --> 00:32.759
How are we gonna pay our rent?

00:32.761 --> 00:34.610
Hey, how about a little
support for the girl

00:34.611 --> 00:36.649
who floated your rent when
you were in Switzerland?

00:36.650 --> 00:39.085
Or who gave up cable so that
you could have chef's knives?

00:39.086 --> 00:42.244
And who really needs a hug
and a roll of cookie dough.

00:42.297 --> 00:45.013
Oh, okay. No, you know what? You're right.

00:45.014 --> 00:46.443
It's gonna be fine.

00:46.938 --> 00:49.302
Yeah, you quit your job.

Uh, hi.

01:27.052 --> 01:28.252
Hey.

01:28.772 --> 01:30.722
Gabi, how bout some coffee for these guys?

01:30.723 --> 01:33.802
I don't know if that's a good idea,
they haven't blinked since I got here.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.329
(Chuckles) They're probably just
in the zone for their interview.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.544
I'm hiring a paid intern to
help me roll out my new app.

01:38.545 --> 01:40.930
(Gasps) I know somebody
who needs to get paid.

01:40.931 --> 01:42.131
Sofia.

01:43.218 --> 01:45.101
Gabi, these guys all have MBA's.

01:45.136 --> 01:48.054
(Groans) Josh, I don't
care about basketball.

01:49.856 --> 01:52.025
I care about Sofia getting a job, okay?

01:52.026 --> 01:53.405
Will you please just interview her?

01:53.406 --> 01:55.311
You're putting me in a
really awkward position.

01:55.313 --> 01:57.076
Which I should be used to by now.

01:57.148 --> 01:59.383
Just give her an interview.
You might be surprised.

01:59.384 --> 02:01.258
I mean we are best friends
but we are nothing alike.

02:01.259 --> 02:02.459
Sold.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.105
Have her here in an hour.

02:04.106 --> 02:05.538
Thank you.

02:05.574 --> 02:08.958
And if she's not the best interview
you've ever had I will work for free.

02:08.994 --> 02:11.878
No, went too far. The point is,

02:11.913 --> 02:14.992
she will be great and you will
still have to pay me. Good day, sir.

02:20.171 --> 02:23.464
Well, you're an adorable
little red riding hood.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.395
What a deep voice you have, Grandmother.

02:27.765 --> 02:29.979
You know what, I'm not
feeling this, it's weird.

02:31.935 --> 02:34.068
My mother dropped off a kugel for you,

02:34.069 --> 02:36.069
'cause she adores you.

02:36.104 --> 02:38.988
(Sighs) I love that you
and my mom get along.

02:39.024 --> 02:41.240
So when the hell am I
gonna meet your mother?

02:41.883 --> 02:44.027
Oh, is that a thing?

02:44.079 --> 02:45.660
That we have to do?

02:46.331 --> 02:47.531
What's going on?

02:47.532 --> 02:49.863
Are you embarrassed of
me? Am I not good enough?

02:49.864 --> 02:51.834
Did you tell her I was Korean?

02:53.435 --> 02:55.685
It's not you, it's her.

02:55.778 --> 02:58.578
My mom is crazy mean.

02:58.614 --> 03:01.700
Like a short, Asian, Simon Cowell.

03:02.947 --> 03:05.119
And I can be her Ryan Seacrest.

03:07.702 --> 03:10.182
Don't worry, moms love me.

03:10.183 --> 03:11.597
And we're gonna be family.

03:15.015 --> 03:16.943
You have told her we're engaged?

03:17.178 --> 03:19.695
Gabi's the one that outed me to my parents.

03:19.696 --> 03:22.609
Only a matter of time
before she tells them this.

03:22.777 --> 03:25.652
Elliot, if you don't call your mom
and invite her over this weekend,

03:25.653 --> 03:26.999
you're not getting my kugel.

03:28.268 --> 03:29.958
And I think you know what that means.

03:35.597 --> 03:38.315
Oh, honey, you know you're
not chopping anything, right?

03:38.316 --> 03:41.017
I'm pretending to work while Sofia
finishes her interview with Josh.

03:41.052 --> 03:44.053
(Laughs) I get it. I'm
pretending to be sober.

03:45.531 --> 03:47.498
- (Gasps excitedly)
- Hey, how'd it go?

03:47.499 --> 03:49.976
Crushed it! I could teach
a class on crushing it.

03:49.977 --> 03:52.880
But I'm gonna be too busy in my fancy
new job where I will be crushing it.

03:52.881 --> 03:53.980
Yeah!

03:53.981 --> 03:55.744
This is so great, we're
gonna be working together.

03:55.745 --> 03:57.727
It's gonna be just like
when we were camp counselors,

03:57.728 --> 04:00.679
except with no pesky virginity to lose.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.472
Yeah!

04:02.474 --> 04:05.291
Well, I am going to lunch
with Ruben because, well,

04:05.326 --> 04:08.100
I don't know. I think he's
about to drop the L-word.

04:08.101 --> 04:10.395
(Gasps) I L-word the L-word.

04:10.607 --> 04:13.785
Me too! This is the
best day ever, thank you!

04:13.888 --> 04:16.002
- Welcome. Bye.
- Bye.

04:17.567 --> 04:20.589
Hey. Isn't Sofia amazing?

04:20.589 --> 04:22.540
She's smart, she has a
good head for business,

04:22.541 --> 04:23.814
she's clean.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.864
You're right, she is all of those things.

04:28.983 --> 04:30.500
But I'm gonna go with Dexter.

04:30.502 --> 04:32.452
He's got a business degree from
Stanford and in his spare time

04:32.453 --> 04:34.420
he researches artificial intelligence.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.833
But Sofia's intelligence is real.

04:39.494 --> 04:42.512
Gabi, look, I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

04:42.547 --> 04:44.380
Do you want me to break the news to her?

04:44.416 --> 04:46.215
No, I'll do it when I get home.

04:46.251 --> 04:48.101
It's better coming from a friend.

04:48.136 --> 04:49.852
Wait, last question.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.989
Is it possible that I could hire an intern?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.594
Hey, Sofia, I got something to tell you.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.797
(Sobbing)

05:01.125 --> 05:03.140
No, no, no, he said I could tell you.

05:03.141 --> 05:05.530
Wait, why would Ruben tell
you to break up with me?

05:06.538 --> 05:09.238
'Cause he's a candy assed, little baby man.

05:10.591 --> 05:13.007
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:14.129 --> 05:16.112
He dropped the L-word all right.

05:16.147 --> 05:18.251
"Let go of my arm, Sofia. It's over."

05:19.734 --> 05:23.448
God, I suck. I've got no man, no job.

05:23.822 --> 05:25.485
The only shred of hope I have left

05:25.486 --> 05:27.423
is if I get that job at Josh's.

05:29.281 --> 05:31.081
Yeah, about that shred.

05:31.235 --> 05:33.102
I didn't get it, did I?

05:33.103 --> 05:35.186
(Sobs, then yells)

05:41.206 --> 05:43.924
The only thing you blew...

05:44.204 --> 05:46.771
Was Josh's mind.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.411
What do you mean?

05:48.412 --> 05:50.184
I mean you, uh...

05:50.615 --> 05:52.273
- You, uh...
- I got the job?

05:52.274 --> 05:53.586
I got the job!

05:53.799 --> 05:55.623
- (Gasps)
- It appears that way.

05:55.624 --> 05:58.154
Oh, my God! Why didn't you text me earlier?

05:58.189 --> 06:00.538
'Cause I, wanted to see
your face when you...

06:00.539 --> 06:03.059
- You heard the news.
- Thank God, I'm so happy!

06:03.094 --> 06:05.027
Thank you, this is unbelievable!

06:05.063 --> 06:06.387
It sure is.

06:10.802 --> 06:12.002
Um...

06:12.003 --> 06:13.288
What are you doing?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.558
Oh, it's nine o'clock and
I need it to be nine-thirty.

06:15.559 --> 06:16.759
Uh...

06:16.977 --> 06:18.874
You know that's not how time works, huh?

06:19.551 --> 06:22.064
I know, but Sofia was so depressed
when I got home last night,

06:22.065 --> 06:24.319
I didn't have the heart to tell her
she didn't get the internship, so,

06:24.320 --> 06:27.951
I gotta get Josh out of here before
she gets here for her fake first day.

06:29.469 --> 06:31.503
Can you just play along
until I figure out what to do?

06:31.504 --> 06:32.800
Please? I'll do anything.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.180
Anything?

06:35.012 --> 06:36.612
Can I get that in writing?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.505
No, no, no. Scratch that. No paper trail.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.703
Good morning.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.541
Oh, hey Josh. Listen, I
packed your breakfast to go

06:46.542 --> 06:48.600
so you're not late for
your meeting, goodbye.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.427
Gabi, I'm fine. The meeting's in an hour.

06:50.428 --> 06:52.661
Oh, oh, ho-ho, really?

06:53.735 --> 06:56.681
Well, that clock must be broken because
my watch says it's nine o' clock.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.430
Oh, so I'm on time for work?

07:00.359 --> 07:01.972
Son of a bitch, my watch is broken.

07:02.616 --> 07:03.816
Have Elliot fix this.

07:03.817 --> 07:05.737
- Okay, all right, good bye.
- I'm gonna be late.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.512
Hi!

07:10.564 --> 07:12.917
I'm here, at my job!

07:13.751 --> 07:16.071
And I brought coffee like you asked me to.

07:16.181 --> 07:17.530
Okay, so where's Josh?

07:17.531 --> 07:18.954
Ah, you just missed him.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.876
But, don't worry, he left me a list
of things for you to get started on.

07:21.877 --> 07:24.900
The first of which is to...

07:24.901 --> 07:27.602
Take pictures of everything in his office.

07:27.603 --> 07:29.164
Oh. (Chuckles)

07:29.200 --> 07:30.400
Why?

07:31.268 --> 07:32.835
Why indeed.

07:34.004 --> 07:35.938
In case there's a fire and he has to

07:35.940 --> 07:38.443
recreate everything in
a second location, duh.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.743
Oh, rich people are weird.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.481
Hey, Yolanda.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.038
Hey, working girl.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.285
(Doorbell rings)

07:50.321 --> 07:51.882
Oh no, she's here!

07:51.883 --> 07:53.526
She's here!

07:54.992 --> 07:56.834
Oh God, what am I gonna
do with her all day?

07:56.835 --> 08:01.349
Ooh, introduce her to the exciting
fast-paced world of watch repair.

08:02.253 --> 08:03.837
Josh wants you to get that fixed.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.839
Hello, Mother, it's lovely to see you.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.861
It's lovely you can see at
all with those fat cheeks.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.614
(Giggles) This is incredible.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.520
I feel like I should be taking notes.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.860
Mother,

08:24.029 --> 08:25.487
I want to show you something.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.246
Oh, my God!

08:27.324 --> 08:29.390
You found a ring that fits you.

08:30.361 --> 08:31.939
That's why I wanted to talk to you,

08:31.940 --> 08:34.229
a wonderful man has asked me to marry him.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.101
Whoa, fancy.

08:41.038 --> 08:43.672
Whoa, fancier.

08:44.909 --> 08:47.126
Yeah, well, Josh has expensive tastes.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.327
Josh?

08:49.313 --> 08:50.513
Hey!

08:51.482 --> 08:54.349
Mrs. Park. Elliot didn't
tell me you were stopping by.

08:54.385 --> 08:58.020
He just told me about the engagement!

08:59.023 --> 09:00.956
- Isn't it exciting?
- (Giggles excitedly)

09:00.958 --> 09:03.859
Sorry men of the world,
Elliot Park is of the market.

09:06.096 --> 09:08.747
Hey, I'm late for a meeting. I
just forgot a bag in my office.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.375
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it!

09:12.770 --> 09:14.744
Mrs. Park, always good to see you.

09:14.817 --> 09:16.222
You, too...

09:18.198 --> 09:20.141
Son-in-law.

09:20.578 --> 09:23.481
How did you score that, Miss Fatty LaBelle?

09:26.771 --> 09:28.539
Sofia, uh, I just remembered,

09:28.540 --> 09:30.481
Josh wants you to move
that plant behind the door!

09:30.482 --> 09:32.078
- What?
- Stop questioning me!

09:38.095 --> 09:39.569
(Sighs)

09:39.797 --> 09:42.515
- Now what?
- Okay, uh, now back to business.

09:42.516 --> 09:46.097
Uh, now Josh wants you to, uh...

09:46.098 --> 09:49.690
Uh... ah, oh, work on these files

09:49.707 --> 09:52.882
ah, for the rest of the day, from home.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.191
Oh, well why can't I
just work on them here?

09:56.065 --> 09:57.397
(Exasperated sighing)

09:57.754 --> 09:59.710
Sofia, I don't know. I mean, uh,

09:59.723 --> 10:02.736
Josh is a genius, you know.
Would you ask Albert Einstein

10:02.737 --> 10:05.309
why he would work on his files from home?

10:05.310 --> 10:07.318
No, because he's dead.

10:10.869 --> 10:12.069
Josh,

10:12.070 --> 10:14.371
a situation has presented itself.

10:14.832 --> 10:17.916
It seems that my mother
thinks you're my fiance.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.495
Ha, ha, ha!

10:19.637 --> 10:20.837
Isn't that funny?

10:21.724 --> 10:24.161
- No.
- But here's the funny part,

10:24.217 --> 10:27.400
she likes me because
she thinks you like me.

10:27.401 --> 10:29.869
You know who really likes you? Alan,

10:29.870 --> 10:32.164
your actual fiance.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.509
And I love him too, but there's
no guarantee that mother will.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.419
She's finally being nice to me.

10:37.454 --> 10:40.074
It feels good, it feels real good.

10:40.892 --> 10:44.843
Can't you just pretend to be my fiance
for one night until she leaves tomorrow?

10:44.844 --> 10:46.044
No.

10:46.570 --> 10:47.872
You don't understand.

10:47.873 --> 10:50.487
She gave me my first compliment ever.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.457
She said my weight gain
is plateauing nicely.

10:54.372 --> 10:56.896
Please, oh please, oh please,
oh please, oh please, oh please,

10:56.897 --> 10:58.297
oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please,

10:58.298 --> 10:59.498
- oh please.
- All right!

10:59.499 --> 11:01.042
Yeah!

11:03.111 --> 11:04.544
FYI, tonight,

11:04.545 --> 11:07.336
you're going to need to be a little
bit less of a cold bitch. Thanks.

11:13.157 --> 11:17.565
Oh my God, Gabi, I
discovered something huge.

11:17.861 --> 11:20.176
That you don't want to
work for Josh anymore?

11:21.482 --> 11:23.259
I was looking through the files you gave me

11:23.260 --> 11:26.937
and I found a patent application
for his new app that he never signed,

11:26.938 --> 11:30.182
but because I found it he
can fix it and save millions.

11:31.053 --> 11:34.939
Yeah, see I told you to look
for typos, not save him millions.

11:35.579 --> 11:38.525
I know, isn't it great?

11:38.953 --> 11:41.332
I'm gonna tell him all about
it first thing in the morning.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.784
No, no you're not.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.154
Ah, I'm not?

11:45.914 --> 11:47.222
Sofia...

11:47.257 --> 11:48.560
Gah!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.793
This is really hard for me to say,

11:51.794 --> 11:53.211
but there may have been something

11:53.212 --> 11:55.172
about the job at Josh's that I told you

11:55.173 --> 11:57.045
that wasn't 100 percent true.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.801
- What?
- That you have it.

12:00.329 --> 12:01.529
What?

12:01.772 --> 12:03.586
Josh didn't actually hire you.

12:03.587 --> 12:06.773
I lied and I said that he did
because Ruben broke up with you

12:06.774 --> 12:08.407
and you were really sad.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.512
What?

12:10.868 --> 12:12.635
I know, I'm really sorry, okay?

12:12.636 --> 12:14.472
When you quit your job I freaked out and...

12:14.473 --> 12:16.529
well, you know what,
it doesn't even matter.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.875
- Yeah.
- No, get off me!

12:20.257 --> 12:23.486
Because I'm gonna tell Josh
what I found and when I do

12:23.487 --> 12:25.397
he's gonna give me a job. Hmph!

12:26.930 --> 12:29.468
Will he or will he not and also fire me?

12:29.867 --> 12:31.566
Gabi, why would he fire you?

12:31.602 --> 12:34.340
Ah, because I think
stealing confidential files

12:34.341 --> 12:36.738
and giving them to your
roommate is frowned upon.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.476
(Sighs) Okay, well, hmm.

12:39.477 --> 12:41.740
The responsible thing to do is to just

12:41.741 --> 12:45.184
go to Josh, okay, and we're just gonna
tell him everything that happened.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.440
Or...

12:50.154 --> 12:53.358
Or we could do whatever stupid
plan you're thinking of now.

12:54.321 --> 12:56.838
- Yeah.
- No, get off of me!

13:00.731 --> 13:01.934
Josh,

13:01.935 --> 13:05.974
I want you to have this
as an engagement present.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.546
We'll treasure it.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.475
So Josh, tell me,

13:13.752 --> 13:18.046
how did I get to be so lucky
to have you as a son-in-law?

13:18.081 --> 13:19.364
Yes, Josh,

13:19.649 --> 13:21.933
tell mother what it is you love about me.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.290
You know,

13:29.059 --> 13:30.725
it's the usual stuff, it's...

13:32.663 --> 13:34.485
His style,

13:34.681 --> 13:36.008
personality,

13:36.140 --> 13:37.740
my cute tushy?

13:40.370 --> 13:41.570
Sure.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.307
But most importantly,

13:45.359 --> 13:47.075
I love his mom.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.310
(Gasps)

13:49.313 --> 13:53.168
If you were straight and
I was five years younger...

13:55.018 --> 13:57.545
Elliot, you found a winner.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.871
I'm proud of you.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.573
Really, Mother?

14:01.608 --> 14:02.874
(Doorbell rings)

14:02.910 --> 14:04.580
Elliot, you go.

14:04.904 --> 14:06.210
You stay.

14:09.928 --> 14:11.128
Alan.

14:11.869 --> 14:14.219
What are you doing here? I
told you my mother was sick.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.591
That's why I brought chicken soup.

14:15.592 --> 14:18.206
Thanks, I'll be sure she gets it. Bye-ee.

14:18.207 --> 14:19.450
Elliot,

14:19.451 --> 14:21.571
why don't you want me to
meet my future mother-in-law?

14:22.196 --> 14:24.170
A situation has presented itself.

14:24.252 --> 14:25.713
What situation?

14:25.714 --> 14:28.984
A situation where my mom
thinks Josh is my fiance.

14:29.019 --> 14:31.059
(Laughs)

14:31.788 --> 14:32.988
Isn't that funny?

14:33.006 --> 14:34.890
Oh, I get it.

14:34.925 --> 14:37.986
You told her Josh is your fiance
because you're ashamed of me.

14:38.126 --> 14:39.394
No.

14:39.429 --> 14:41.614
It's just that for the
first time in my life

14:41.615 --> 14:43.114
my mom said she was proud of me.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.300
And she wouldn't be
proud if you were with me?

14:45.335 --> 14:46.824
You don't understand

14:46.825 --> 14:48.858
because your mother's not a monster.

14:49.239 --> 14:52.360
Even if my mother was
the meanest woman in Boca,

14:53.310 --> 14:55.844
I would never be ashamed to introduce you.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.463
- I'm not ashamed.
- Then introduce me right now.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.620
- Right now, now?
- (Elevator dings)

15:00.621 --> 15:03.480
That's it, Elliot. You've made
your choice and I've made mine.

15:03.481 --> 15:04.774
Goodbye.

15:05.889 --> 15:07.455
I'll need that pot back.

15:09.263 --> 15:11.230
...the scotch.

15:20.848 --> 15:22.222
Hey Josh, ah,

15:22.223 --> 15:24.941
I hope you don't mind, I invited
Sofia to have lunch on the terrace

15:24.942 --> 15:26.348
I thought a little dining Al fresco

15:26.349 --> 15:28.918
might help her feel a
little less depressed-o.

15:31.282 --> 15:32.532
Well, looks like it's working.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.806
I hope you don't mind, I'm just
gonna dust your file cabinet.

15:35.807 --> 15:38.313
- Okay.
- Why the third degree? It's my job!

15:39.266 --> 15:41.549
Um, I'm just gonna get the files out.

15:45.956 --> 15:47.530
- Ooh!
- Yolanda.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.430
Oh no, your files! I'll get them.

15:51.437 --> 15:53.654
A-ha! I mean, alas!

15:53.932 --> 15:56.666
What's this I just found right now, Josh?

15:56.667 --> 15:57.975
(Cell ringing)

15:57.976 --> 15:59.596
Hold that thought, it's my attorney.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.028
Hey Larry, what's up?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.345
What patent didn't I sign?

16:04.346 --> 16:05.795
This one. This one.

16:05.796 --> 16:07.970
Oh, thank God you caught
this, you're the man.

16:07.971 --> 16:09.916
No, I'm the man. I'm the man!

16:09.917 --> 16:12.577
You know what? If you didn't
work for me, I'd hire you.

16:12.578 --> 16:14.490
So here's what I want to do next
time. Let's really stick to the process

16:14.491 --> 16:15.710
and avoid this...

16:17.546 --> 16:19.471
Great plan, Gabi.

16:23.251 --> 16:24.525
Now she's depressed-o.

16:30.642 --> 16:32.025
Elliot...

16:32.060 --> 16:33.462
I'm sorry.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.123
I was up all night
thinking about Alan's kugel

16:36.124 --> 16:37.669
and how I'm never gonna have it again.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.640
You just have to talk to him.

16:41.770 --> 16:44.186
I can't, I'm too ashamed.

16:44.289 --> 16:46.093
Yeah, I know.

16:46.184 --> 16:47.680
Which is why...

16:47.931 --> 16:49.264
I called him.

16:49.644 --> 16:52.430
Finally, I've been standing out
here like a schmuck for 10 minutes.

16:53.986 --> 16:55.186
Hi.

16:55.198 --> 16:56.616
Oh my God.

16:57.014 --> 16:59.848
Elliot, I was wrong to walk away like that.

16:59.849 --> 17:01.715
You know I have a flair for the dramatic.

17:03.053 --> 17:06.990
But after Josh called and explained
how terrible your mother really is,

17:06.991 --> 17:09.258
I realized you need something.

17:09.259 --> 17:11.153
- What?
- This.

17:11.256 --> 17:12.455
(Laughs)

17:13.477 --> 17:15.242
I don't deserve you.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.614
You don't.

17:17.705 --> 17:19.833
But where am I going? I'm 42.

17:20.217 --> 17:21.416
(Doorbell rings)

17:25.327 --> 17:27.488
Mother, I thought you were
on your way to the airport.

17:27.489 --> 17:31.404
I couldn't leave without
saying goodbye to my son-in-law.

17:32.696 --> 17:35.410
Where's Josh, I don't see him.

17:36.428 --> 17:38.116
He dumped you, didn't he?

17:39.012 --> 17:41.470
I knew you weren't good enough for him.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.755
Oy vey.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.374
Who's this?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.867
I saw you downstairs.

17:47.903 --> 17:49.743
Are you the doorman?

17:50.597 --> 17:52.917
I don't tip people over 30.

17:55.045 --> 17:57.377
I'm nobody, I was just leaving.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.100
Stop!

18:02.417 --> 18:04.100
You're not nobody.

18:05.009 --> 18:07.613
Mother, this is Alan.

18:07.614 --> 18:09.535
The man I'm going to marry.

18:09.879 --> 18:12.147
You're marrying a doorman?

18:13.853 --> 18:16.341
He's not the doorman, he's the man I love.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.811
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Park.

18:18.812 --> 18:20.012
(Gasps)

18:21.490 --> 18:22.690
Him?

18:22.746 --> 18:24.901
And not my Josh?

18:26.266 --> 18:27.924
But Josh is a 10.

18:29.302 --> 18:30.649
You're a four.

18:32.238 --> 18:33.607
At best.

18:35.008 --> 18:37.717
But after you taste my kugel,
I'll shoot up to a five.

18:39.079 --> 18:40.641
What the hell's a kugel?

18:42.048 --> 18:44.108
Speak English, four.

18:45.018 --> 18:47.379
- That's enough.
- No Elliot, it's fine.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.948
No, it's not fine.

18:48.949 --> 18:50.655
Let me tell you something.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.590
Alan is a 10 in my book.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.188
What book are you reading?

18:55.628 --> 18:58.563
A book called, "I've
had enough of your crap,

18:58.565 --> 19:01.449
"Alan is an amazing man
and I'm lucky to have him,

19:01.501 --> 19:03.372
"so deal with it."

19:05.088 --> 19:06.971
That's the title?

19:07.223 --> 19:09.057
(Chuckles)

19:09.092 --> 19:11.565
Writing was never your strong suit.

19:12.704 --> 19:14.696
And being supportive isn't yours.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.393
I've heard enough.

19:17.394 --> 19:18.685
I'm leaving.

19:18.704 --> 19:19.917
Good.

19:19.953 --> 19:21.215
Go!

19:21.216 --> 19:24.806
Well, I guess I'm not gonna
win her over after all.

19:24.841 --> 19:26.510
I better get back to the hospital,

19:26.511 --> 19:28.006
I'm needed in surgery.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.158
You're a doctor?

19:36.279 --> 19:38.670
A neurosurgeon, actually.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.877
Welcome to the family.

19:45.412 --> 19:48.413
Told ya. Moms love me.

19:48.465 --> 19:49.873
So do Elliot's.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.515
Hey.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.527
Look what I gotcha.

19:57.528 --> 19:58.894
Oh, uh-oh.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.109
What?

20:00.110 --> 20:01.658
Look what I gotcha.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.123
Ohh.

20:03.124 --> 20:04.949
Wait, why do you feel guilty?

20:04.950 --> 20:06.648
I'm the one that messed everything up.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.323
Eh. Okay, um...

20:09.324 --> 20:12.041
Wow, this is really hard
for me to say, but, um...

20:12.076 --> 20:14.186
I may have told you something
about quitting my job

20:14.187 --> 20:15.868
that wasn't 100 percent true.

20:15.869 --> 20:17.218
- What?
- That I quit my job.

20:17.219 --> 20:18.419
What?

20:19.050 --> 20:20.883
- I was fired.
- What?

20:20.918 --> 20:22.752
When they promoted that guy over me,

20:22.804 --> 20:24.837
I may have said a couple
of things to my boss

20:24.889 --> 20:27.223
that were inappropriate for the workplace.

20:27.258 --> 20:28.784
Or any place.

20:30.828 --> 20:32.928
Wait, Sofia, you were
fired instead of quit?

20:32.930 --> 20:34.847
Do you understand what this means?

20:34.899 --> 20:36.404
Now you think less of me?

20:36.449 --> 20:37.654
No.

20:37.681 --> 20:39.747
Now you can collect unemployment.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.296
- Oh my God, yes!
- Yes!
