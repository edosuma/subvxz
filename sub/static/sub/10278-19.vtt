00:04.054 --> 00:06.459
E. R.

00:06.460 --> 00:07.549
Previously on E. R.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.855
There she is. That's my daughter.

00:10.717 --> 00:11.757
Hi, Mom.

00:11.758 --> 00:15.128
I can't have you here. I told you
that last time. I can't do it anymore.

00:15.129 --> 00:16.895
How long has she been bipolar?

00:16.896 --> 00:17.996
Since I was a kid.

00:17.997 --> 00:20.273
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

00:20.574 --> 00:22.433
I'm sorry. It's all part of the disease.

00:22.434 --> 00:24.529
- Don't sass me! I'm your mother!
- Not by choice.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.053
Do you want 5 of Haldol?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.404
Come on, Maggie. Calm down.

00:32.405 --> 00:34.040
I held your little hands.

00:35.316 --> 00:37.595
I loved you. God, how I loved you.

00:37.696 --> 00:40.099
- I know. I know.
- I'm so sorry.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.180
E. R. 7x19 "SAILING AWAY"

00:44.354 --> 00:45.433
So he's a scalper.

00:45.605 --> 00:49.472
He's a respiratory therapist. But he's
got a friend who can get us good seats.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.682
FRIDAY

00:50.860 --> 00:53.564
So it's either a sporting event
or a concert.

00:53.738 --> 00:55.232
- No more hints.
- Sporting event.

00:55.406 --> 00:57.612
Were you a kid who peeked
at birthday presents?

00:57.783 --> 00:59.111
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

00:59.284 --> 01:00.315
- Hey.
- You on swing?

01:00.494 --> 01:02.533
An hour left.
Bringing your dog to work?

01:02.704 --> 01:03.867
No, picking something up.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.284
- What's his name?
- Norman.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.829
- Hi, Norman.
- Don't let him get close to your leg.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.459
- John!
- Don't be ashamed.

01:09.627 --> 01:11.287
- He's a guy.
- I'm getting him fixed.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.040
- Oh, God!
- What?

01:13.214 --> 01:15.040
- That car.
- What about it?

01:15.215 --> 01:17.291
Read the license plate.

01:18.135 --> 01:19.166
"Man-o-med"?

01:19.970 --> 01:21.168
That's Richard.

01:23.056 --> 01:24.087
Who's Richard?

01:25.141 --> 01:27.632
Randi, is there a guy
named Richard looking for me?

01:27.810 --> 01:28.973
- Your ex?
- Yes.

01:29.145 --> 01:32.395
In the lounge, talking with Dr. Kovac.

01:32.565 --> 01:36.229
Call Security. Tell them there's a BMW
illegally parked in the ambulance bay.

01:36.401 --> 01:41.146
She tried to quit three times while we
were together. Got addicted to the gum.

01:42.907 --> 01:45.030
- What do you need?
- You didn't return my calls.

01:45.201 --> 01:47.158
- When did you call?
- Last night.

01:47.495 --> 01:49.653
I haven't checked my messages yet.

01:53.834 --> 01:55.992
- Excuse me.
- Nice meeting you.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.794
Yeah.

02:01.758 --> 02:05.091
Look, it's your mom.
She's gone off the reservation again.

02:05.261 --> 02:08.381
She's holed up in a motel outside
of Muskogee, Oklahoma.

02:11.267 --> 02:12.926
She called you?

02:13.102 --> 02:16.102
No. Apparently, some guy
that she's been traveling with...

02:16.271 --> 02:19.106
...prepaid the room for a week
and split three weeks ago.

02:19.274 --> 02:22.856
The manager of the hotel got
your old number, which is my number...

02:23.027 --> 02:25.020
...and took it out of her bag.

02:25.196 --> 02:27.188
What was he doing going
through her stuff?

02:27.365 --> 02:31.362
Looking for money. He says she's all
spaced out. She won't leave the room.

02:31.535 --> 02:32.910
Is she answering the door?

02:35.539 --> 02:38.208
Richard, is she answering the door?

02:42.128 --> 02:44.453
You should call this guy.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.006
I'm sorry, Abby.

02:53.805 --> 02:56.130
E. R.

03:45.227 --> 03:46.805
How did you fall?

03:46.979 --> 03:48.722
Greased pigs.

03:48.897 --> 03:51.732
- What?
- We were chasing greased pigs.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.229
Tau Beta Chi against Gamma Psi Mu.

03:56.488 --> 03:57.567
Is this a contest?

03:57.739 --> 04:03.474
Oh, yeah. And thanks to Tasha,
Tau Beta kicked ass!

04:04.328 --> 04:06.404
Been drinking already?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.659
It's Greek Week.

04:08.165 --> 04:12.376
Okay, we'll have to seal that
with some calcium-hydroxide paste.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.335
I'll be back.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.164
Abby?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.750
- What did the guy say?
- She's there.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.384
He says she owes him $800.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.011
- Do you have that?
- Not really.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.210
I do.

04:24.388 --> 04:25.419
No, Luka.

04:25.597 --> 04:29.097
I'll take care of it. Don't give him
a credit card. We'll wire the money.

04:29.268 --> 04:31.937
I told him I'd give it to him
when I got there.

04:32.103 --> 04:34.179
When you got there?

04:34.355 --> 04:35.684
I'm gonna take a redeye.

04:35.857 --> 04:39.190
No, Abby. We'll call the local
hospital, talk to a psychiatrist...

04:39.360 --> 04:41.518
...and see if the police will bring her in.

04:41.696 --> 04:44.447
I can't put my mother in a lockup
in Oklahoma.

04:44.615 --> 04:46.524
You can fly down once she's medicated.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.116
No, if I have to commit her,
it'll be easier to do it from Chicago.

04:50.287 --> 04:52.279
- Why are you doing this?
- My mother's sick.

04:52.455 --> 04:54.780
I know. I saw what she did
to you last time.

04:54.958 --> 04:58.207
Dr. Kovac, possible DKE in 4.
Accu-Chek is 400.

04:58.377 --> 05:00.085
In a second.

05:02.548 --> 05:05.632
I have to talk to the supervisor,
see if I can switch my shift.

05:05.801 --> 05:07.295
Abby, don't go out there.

05:07.469 --> 05:10.042
It's my problem.

05:11.973 --> 05:13.432
- Damn it!
- You all right?

05:13.600 --> 05:14.928
Oh, yeah. No problem.

05:18.479 --> 05:22.179
Mark, I don't know why you insist on
baby-proofing every drawer and cabinet.

05:22.358 --> 05:24.480
The baby's not gonna be
crawling immediately.

05:24.651 --> 05:27.818
There's a high likelihood that he's
gonna be advanced for his age.

05:27.988 --> 05:31.736
- Who was at the door?
- UPS. More gifts.

05:31.908 --> 05:34.778
Between the baby and the wedding,
they know me by name.

05:34.952 --> 05:36.530
You didn't lift anything, I hope.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.328
No. It was light.

05:38.497 --> 05:41.415
No lifting. I'm serious.

05:46.671 --> 05:47.751
What are you doing?

05:48.673 --> 05:50.500
Trying to get this show on the road.

05:50.675 --> 05:54.258
- I hope you don't have it on the floor.
- I've been sitting around for days.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.255
I need to move.

05:56.430 --> 05:59.265
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

05:59.433 --> 06:02.185
- I had to pee, Haleh.
- I didn't say anything.

06:02.352 --> 06:04.926
You have nothing in coach?

06:05.105 --> 06:08.604
Okay. Well, what if I fly
into Oklahoma City?

06:08.775 --> 06:10.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:10.276 --> 06:12.316
What did Richard want?

06:13.112 --> 06:17.489
My mother has bottomed out
40 miles outside of Tulsa.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.369
And, of all people, the motel owner
had to call Richard.

06:20.536 --> 06:22.196
- Hey!
- Did you talk to her?

06:23.121 --> 06:26.455
She's not picking up the phone,
and she won't come out of the room.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.997
Hey, your dog!

06:30.587 --> 06:31.749
- John!
- Norman, drop that!

06:31.921 --> 06:34.079
- You brought him in?
- We used the bathroom.

06:34.257 --> 06:37.127
- Is that gonna hurt him?
- No worse than a chilidog.

06:37.301 --> 06:39.590
No! Good boy. Come on.

06:39.762 --> 06:42.431
- Did you get the tickets?
- All set.

06:42.597 --> 06:45.931
So am I gonna have to call you a cab,
or will you make it back?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.180
I'll meet you outside.

06:47.352 --> 06:49.344
- What's wrong?
- I want to change that bag.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.596
Five minutes.
Or you can start running.

06:51.772 --> 06:54.346
- I'll wait.
- A dog has no business in a hospital!

06:54.525 --> 06:55.556
Seeing Eye dog.

06:55.734 --> 06:59.352
Well, how many people are going
to Oklahoma tonight?

06:59.530 --> 07:02.020
No. Thank you.

07:02.199 --> 07:03.657
- You okay?
- Can't get a flight.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.147
Direct to Tulsa?

07:05.327 --> 07:06.655
I can't get anywhere close.

07:06.828 --> 07:09.283
There's no connection open.
What are you doing?

07:09.455 --> 07:12.491
I have a good travel agent.
She always finds something.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.494
Wanna fly out tonight?
Hi. Katie Witcher, please.

07:17.296 --> 07:20.296
- Open return?
- No, I have to drive her back.

07:21.383 --> 07:23.375
- Why?
- Because she can't handle flying.

07:23.551 --> 07:26.552
You're gonna drive her all the way back
to Chicago by yourself?

07:27.222 --> 07:29.463
Is Luka going with you?

07:31.892 --> 07:34.217
Hey, Katie. It's John Carter.

07:34.395 --> 07:36.471
Good. Yeah.

07:36.647 --> 07:41.854
Any way that you could find me
two one-way tickets to Tulsa?

07:42.319 --> 07:43.517
Tonight.

08:07.925 --> 08:09.206
Mark?

08:10.678 --> 08:11.958
Mark!

08:23.857 --> 08:25.232
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

08:26.025 --> 08:28.231
I think it's time.

08:29.862 --> 08:32.530
- Will I have a black eye?
- Probably.

08:32.698 --> 08:34.856
Piggy-kick to the face.
Bet that's a new one.

08:35.033 --> 08:37.275
It's not funny, Kevin.

08:37.452 --> 08:38.946
- Sorry.
- Do you have a minute?

08:39.120 --> 08:40.152
Yeah.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.038
Your eye movement is intact.

08:42.207 --> 08:46.038
But we'll have to take some x-rays
to make sure there's no fracture.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.704
He could've cracked my face?

08:47.878 --> 08:52.374
Probably not. But maybe next time you
wrestle animals, you should be sober.

08:52.549 --> 08:53.794
Well, it wasn't my idea.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.636
You're still the best-looking
piggy mud-wrestler I know.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.048
Shut up, Kevin.

09:00.723 --> 09:02.550
I'm taking an 11:40 flight to Tulsa.

09:02.725 --> 09:05.726
There's a psychiatric facility
at Saint John's Medical Center-

09:05.895 --> 09:08.220
- Carter's coming with me.
- What?

09:08.397 --> 09:11.932
Her mom suffers from bipolar disorder.
She locked herself in a motel room.

09:12.109 --> 09:15.145
- A motel room?
- Probably in a major depression.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.351
Why do you have to go?

09:16.530 --> 09:20.230
He offered to help.
And I have to drive her back here, so...

09:20.408 --> 09:21.571
I offered to help.

09:22.577 --> 09:24.949
No, you offered to decide for me.

09:25.121 --> 09:29.332
Abby, your mother needs hospitalization,
not a road trip with you and Carter!

09:29.500 --> 09:32.915
Yeah, Luka. We're doing it
for the fun of it. It'll be a blast.

09:33.086 --> 09:35.577
It's a Bulls game.
You said you liked basketball.

09:36.006 --> 09:37.251
- I do.
- Then let's go!

09:37.424 --> 09:39.961
- Abby needs someone with her.
- Can't her boyfriend go?

09:40.134 --> 09:43.088
- Abby, it's a mistake.
- Are you gonna lecture me on this?

09:43.262 --> 09:45.338
- No.
- Good. You have no idea what it's like.

09:45.514 --> 09:48.301
I grew up with this.
I don't want to be lectured on it.

09:48.475 --> 09:50.515
I'm not lecturing. I'm trying to help!

09:50.686 --> 09:54.517
- You're spending the weekend with her.
- And her clinically depressed mother!

09:54.689 --> 09:56.931
- I'll pay for the tickets-
- It's not that.

09:57.192 --> 09:58.935
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

09:59.110 --> 10:01.316
Don't put yourself in the position
to get hurt.

10:01.487 --> 10:04.903
Well, you'd be the expert at that,
wouldn't you?

10:11.371 --> 10:12.402
I'm sorry.

10:12.581 --> 10:13.695
- I'm sorry!
- Go!

10:13.874 --> 10:15.996
- Rena!
- Okay, go.

10:18.378 --> 10:19.457
I think I can make it.

10:19.629 --> 10:22.333
- Hospital policy. In the chair.
- How far are you dilated?

10:22.506 --> 10:24.962
- She wouldn't let me check.
- You're not the doctor.

10:25.134 --> 10:26.794
- I'll get it.
- You get the elevator.

10:26.969 --> 10:28.795
- Having a baby?
- Did your water break?

10:28.971 --> 10:30.050
Why the sneakers?

10:30.222 --> 10:32.629
- I'll be on my feet.
- He's worried about foot pain.

10:32.807 --> 10:34.800
- I've been through this.
- I haven't.

10:34.976 --> 10:36.435
- Are you in labor?
- Got cigars?

10:36.603 --> 10:39.437
- How far apart are the contractions?
- Three to five minutes.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.230
- For how long?
- Every hour.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.724
Sounds like you're getting there.

10:43.901 --> 10:45.810
All right. Is it time?

10:45.986 --> 10:47.528
- We think so.
- Congratulations!

10:47.696 --> 10:49.819
Don't be a hero. Get the epidural.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.318
We'll see.

10:51.992 --> 10:53.984
She'll get it.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.663
I'm so humiliated.

11:06.839 --> 11:09.246
It was an honest mistake.

11:09.674 --> 11:12.509
I've been through it.
I should know what Braxton Hicks are.

11:12.677 --> 11:14.551
Dr. Corday, you drop that baby already?

11:14.721 --> 11:16.512
- Couple more hours.
- Or days.

11:16.681 --> 11:19.717
- I thought you were having your baby.
- I am. Just not right now.

11:19.892 --> 11:22.727
- They're sending us home.
- This place ain't going anywhere.

11:22.895 --> 11:24.603
I don't need this chair anymore.

11:24.772 --> 11:28.187
Relax. You'll need your energy.

11:31.486 --> 11:34.237
SATURDAY

11:43.372 --> 11:45.697
Did you get any sleep on the plane?

11:46.458 --> 11:47.952
No.

11:54.382 --> 11:56.955
Why doesn't she like to fly?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.040
What?

11:59.220 --> 12:01.508
Your mom? Flying.

12:05.892 --> 12:10.221
One day she woke up and decided
she wanted to take us to Disneyland...

12:10.396 --> 12:13.397
...which sounded like a great idea.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.816
We got to skip school,
and we all rushed to the airport.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.812
- She didn't get on the plane?
- No.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.110
When we were over Nevada,

12:21.281 --> 12:25.231
the pilot came over the PA,
playing tour guide.

12:25.410 --> 12:29.657
And she freaked out.

12:30.915 --> 12:33.620
She thought we were flying
over a nuclear test site.

12:33.793 --> 12:36.331
She tried to open
the emergency-exit door.

12:36.921 --> 12:41.831
It took two flight attendants
and three passengers to restrain her.

12:44.761 --> 12:46.635
They tied her in the seat next to me...

12:46.805 --> 12:50.256
...and she screamed her head off
all the way to Los Angeles.

12:53.186 --> 12:55.511
Did you ever make it to Disneyland?

12:56.939 --> 12:58.137
No.

13:30.636 --> 13:33.210
Thirty years, and I still wonder.

13:33.389 --> 13:35.298
Wonder what?

13:36.308 --> 13:38.881
What brings her here?

13:39.978 --> 13:44.889
He was an interstate trucker,
freelance by the look of his rig.

13:45.066 --> 13:47.818
He stayed one night, prepaid the week,
then left.

13:47.986 --> 13:50.820
I figured he'd be coming back for her.

13:51.656 --> 13:54.822
She was ordering pizza for a while,
and then nothing.

13:54.992 --> 13:59.903
Saw her by the candy machine, tried
to talk to her. She didn't say nothing.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.322
Should we-? We should knock first.

14:02.499 --> 14:04.990
No. She don't answer.

14:06.336 --> 14:08.411
Maggie?

14:09.922 --> 14:14.500
Maggie, it's John Carter. We met
in Chicago. I have Abby with me.

14:15.844 --> 14:17.671
Told you.

14:19.181 --> 14:21.007
Thanks. We'll take it from here.

14:21.182 --> 14:24.551
- You're paying her bill, right?
- Yeah, I'll be up to take care of it.

14:55.922 --> 14:57.666
Mom?

15:03.012 --> 15:06.511
God. Abby.

15:26.117 --> 15:27.777
Do you have any clean clothes?

15:31.371 --> 15:33.031
Mom?

15:33.206 --> 15:35.744
Mom, you know where you are?

15:38.294 --> 15:40.702
- I'm in a motel.
- Where?

15:42.256 --> 15:44.379
Where's the motel?

15:45.134 --> 15:46.712
It's in Oklahoma.

15:47.761 --> 15:48.793
- Abby?
- Yeah?

15:49.221 --> 15:50.384
How is she?

15:50.556 --> 15:55.383
Oriented. No focal findings. Can you run
out to the car for me and grab my bag?

15:55.560 --> 15:59.260
- I brought some extra clothes.
- Yeah, sure.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.471
- Raise your arms.
- No.

16:01.649 --> 16:02.680
- Yeah.
- No.

16:02.859 --> 16:07.319
- I need you to raise your arms. Please?
- No.

16:08.906 --> 16:10.364
Hello?

16:11.283 --> 16:13.074
Who's this?

16:13.410 --> 16:14.738
Hey.

16:15.370 --> 16:19.035
No, Abby's inside with her mom.
We're at the motel.

16:19.916 --> 16:24.328
I don't know. I haven't really seen
her yet. Abby's giving her a bath.

16:25.838 --> 16:28.044
Yeah, I will.

16:33.845 --> 16:35.173
What?

16:35.597 --> 16:38.052
You related to her?

16:49.151 --> 16:53.528
- I'm just gonna set them on the bed.
- Thank you.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.948
And Luka called.
He said you can call him tonight.

16:59.869 --> 17:02.442
- Abby?
- Yeah?

17:02.621 --> 17:04.530
There's a diner a mile down the road.

17:04.707 --> 17:07.660
You want me to pick up
something to eat?

17:10.252 --> 17:13.289
Yeah. Some eggs maybe.
And some toast.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.964
Sure. Okay, I'll be right back.

17:25.224 --> 17:27.432
You gonna be okay?

17:30.981 --> 17:32.391
Abby?

17:32.982 --> 17:34.311
Yeah.

17:37.945 --> 17:39.737
- Okay, lean your head back.
- No.

17:39.905 --> 17:43.191
Come on. Come on.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.162
There you go.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.328
Okay.

18:04.052 --> 18:06.294
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:06.471 --> 18:08.843
- Someone, please?
- A nurse will help you.

18:09.015 --> 18:11.091
- When?
- Soon. You're late.

18:11.267 --> 18:12.809
Four minutes. I needed a coffee.

18:12.977 --> 18:14.851
You wouldn't be late
if Weaver was here.

18:15.021 --> 18:17.179
That's true. But she's not. Showtime.

18:17.356 --> 18:20.108
- Will you take me to the bathroom?
- Get this guy a urinal.

18:20.276 --> 18:21.734
- Find a nurse!
- Ow, my-

18:21.902 --> 18:24.737
- What do we got?
- Frat boy. Roof to roof. Didn't make it.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.778
- It's "fraternity. "
- You had a few, man?

18:26.948 --> 18:30.032
- Yeah, stopped counting yesterday.
- I can't walk on either leg.

18:30.201 --> 18:33.617
Reed, you baby!
Pete's the one really messed up.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.828
BP, 110/65. Pulse, 120.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.537
- Complains of chest pain.
- Man, you really ate it.

18:39.710 --> 18:44.039
- I'm okay, man. I hit the trees!
- Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.

18:44.214 --> 18:46.503
- Fall from height?
- Second story. Maybe 20 feet.

18:46.675 --> 18:49.878
- Losers couldn't clear 6 feet.
- It looks like you had trouble too.

18:50.053 --> 18:51.962
- I was the only one that made it.
- How did he fall?

18:52.138 --> 18:53.549
I jumped.

19:02.773 --> 19:04.564
Come in.

19:06.234 --> 19:08.227
No toast.

19:08.403 --> 19:10.146
- Hope you like biscuits.
- Whatever.

19:10.738 --> 19:12.896
Hi, Maggie.

19:13.407 --> 19:15.316
John Carter, Abby's friend.

19:21.915 --> 19:26.244
Abby, you don't have to clean up. I gave
the guy a little extra money for the mess.

19:27.921 --> 19:31.420
Abby, you don't have to clean up.
I took care of it.

19:31.591 --> 19:33.001
Hungry?

19:34.093 --> 19:37.047
No. But she needs to eat, so...

19:39.431 --> 19:40.842
Hey, Mom.

19:41.016 --> 19:42.925
- I need you to eat some eggs now.
- No.

19:43.101 --> 19:44.132
- Yes.
- No.

19:44.311 --> 19:47.228
- Yep. Settle for one bite.
- No.

19:47.397 --> 19:49.188
- Come on.
- Oh, my God! No.

19:49.357 --> 19:50.767
Come on. Just one bite.

19:52.026 --> 19:54.861
- I don't want it.
- Okay. We're ready to go then.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.900
- No.
- Yeah, we're leaving. Let's go.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.778
- I wanna stay here.
- We're leaving. Can you get the bags?

20:00.951 --> 20:03.239
- I'm staying here.
- No, you're not staying here.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.320
- I'm staying.
- I'm taking you to Chicago.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.454
- I don't want to.
- Mom?

20:07.623 --> 20:10.790
- I don't want to go back.
- Mom, this one you're not going to win.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.795
- Okay? So get up. Get off the bed now!
- Abby.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.128
- Okay, we'll carry you.
- No.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.713
- We'll carry you.
- Damn it.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.211
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Get her into the car.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.424
Why can't I stay here?
Why can't I just stay here, please?

20:26.599 --> 20:29.469
- Just let me stay here.
- Come on, Maggie.

20:29.644 --> 20:32.478
Why can't I just stay? No. No.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.896
I want to stay here.
Why won't you let me stay?

20:36.066 --> 20:41.487
Just let me stay here!
Damn it! Just let me stay!

20:41.655 --> 20:45.866
Why won't you let me stay? God!

20:47.326 --> 20:50.944
- Seat belt?
- No. Just go.

20:58.211 --> 21:00.500
- Let's get a post-procedure film.
- Want a Foley?

21:00.672 --> 21:02.830
Let's give this idiot a tube
in every orifice.

21:03.007 --> 21:04.549
Can I please go to the bathroom?

21:04.717 --> 21:06.674
Would you take this man
to the bathroom?

21:06.844 --> 21:08.635
In a minute.

21:08.804 --> 21:11.176
Benton, right?

21:11.682 --> 21:14.173
- Peter Benton.
- Have I seen you before?

21:14.351 --> 21:15.382
Yes.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.095
- What for?
- I believe it was an exploding condom.

21:19.272 --> 21:20.303
Excuse me?

21:20.482 --> 21:23.815
You filled a condom with gas
from a Bunsen burner and set it on fire.

21:23.985 --> 21:26.558
- Mr. Ferris!
- In my classroom.

21:26.737 --> 21:29.026
- How are you?
- You remember? Yes, yes.

21:29.198 --> 21:31.404
I guess all that
detention time paid off.

21:31.575 --> 21:34.944
- I'll take you to the bathroom.
- Thanks. I'm about to have an accident.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.400
You grew a few inches.

21:37.164 --> 21:40.200
- So how have you been?
- Good, until last month. I had a stroke.

21:40.375 --> 21:43.375
- What from?
- Atrial fibrillation.

21:43.544 --> 21:46.249
Left me with some left-sided weakness,
but I'm managing.

21:46.422 --> 21:47.881
What are you doing here today?

21:48.048 --> 21:51.713
I had my teeth cleaned a few days ago,
and they won't stop bleeding.

21:51.885 --> 21:54.341
- What's your Coumadin dosage?
- Five milligrams.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.348
- Any other bleeding? From your nose or-?
- No, just my gums.

21:57.515 --> 21:59.472
- Did they draw your blood?
- An hour ago.

21:59.642 --> 22:02.477
I'll track down your labs
and see what your prothrombin is.

22:02.645 --> 22:05.895
Thank you, Peter.
I mean "Dr. Benton. "

22:19.285 --> 22:21.361
I'm sorry.

22:22.246 --> 22:26.030
I shouldn't have let you come here.
You shouldn't have to deal with this.

22:26.208 --> 22:29.043
It's no problem.

22:30.003 --> 22:32.459
Is this as bad as it gets?

22:32.672 --> 22:34.748
Has it been worse?

22:35.592 --> 22:39.007
It's always different. Sort of.

22:39.762 --> 22:44.969
Or maybe I'm different. Your perspective
changes from 7 to 20.

22:46.018 --> 22:49.184
It was pretty bad the time
she locked herself in the garage...

22:49.354 --> 22:51.430
...and turned on both cars.

22:51.732 --> 22:55.396
- She's been suicidal?
- If you count attempted suicide.

22:55.568 --> 22:59.613
- How many times?
- Seriously, two times.

23:15.003 --> 23:16.829
You cut a tendon, Adam.

23:17.005 --> 23:20.089
Broken bottle. It was stupid. My fault.

23:20.258 --> 23:23.128
- Let me guess. Greek Week.
- How'd you know?

23:23.302 --> 23:25.923
Because you smell
like you've slept in a beer garden.

23:26.096 --> 23:28.552
- Actually, a car trunk, but-
- Here.

23:37.857 --> 23:39.980
So you were locked in a trunk?

23:40.151 --> 23:41.693
Yeah.

23:42.695 --> 23:44.734
It's a pledging thing.

23:44.905 --> 23:47.906
And that's supposed
to make you feel like a man?

23:48.241 --> 23:50.649
I don't know. It's tradition.

23:50.827 --> 23:53.532
- How did the bottle break?
- I was...

23:53.705 --> 23:58.200
I was pounding it on the trunk of the car.
I don't know why, but I panicked.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.167
It's called claustrophobia.

24:00.753 --> 24:03.244
But I knew they'd come back.
They did last time.

24:03.839 --> 24:07.421
- You did this before?
- Yeah, I'm pledging again.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.632
I didn't make it through last time.

24:09.803 --> 24:12.044
Well, I guess you really want this, huh?

24:12.222 --> 24:14.677
It's a good house,
and they're good guys.

24:15.683 --> 24:17.925
Don't you think you're jumping the gun?

24:18.102 --> 24:20.807
- Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.
- You're ready to pop.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.731
- Shouldn't I be the judge of that?
- Is this time for real?

24:23.899 --> 24:27.481
- We should've been here hours ago.
- We were!

24:27.944 --> 24:30.613
If we'd waited any longer,
we would've had a home birth.

24:30.780 --> 24:32.358
- Get any sleep?
- Do I look rested?

24:32.532 --> 24:35.023
- Okay, good luck.
- Thanks.

24:37.036 --> 24:39.657
A chef's salad
and a cup of pea soup for her.

24:39.830 --> 24:42.617
- No, just coffee.
- You have to eat something.

24:42.791 --> 24:45.543
- No.
- Mom.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.246
Pie.

24:47.420 --> 24:50.042
Fine. But could you bring
a glass of milk, please?

24:50.215 --> 24:51.495
Sure.

24:53.134 --> 24:55.755
Well, it's about 30
more miles to Springfield.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.213
And there's not much
after that until St. Louis.

24:59.390 --> 25:02.059
Unless you want to stay
in a town called Lebanon.

25:02.226 --> 25:04.763
It sounds kind of dangerous.

25:06.688 --> 25:09.891
- Maggie, how'd you end up in Oklahoma?
- Don't bother.

25:10.066 --> 25:13.435
- He can talk to me if he wants.
- Fine.

25:13.611 --> 25:18.107
- How'd you end up in Oklahoma?
- None of your business.

25:22.077 --> 25:23.405
- What's that?
- Depakote.

25:23.578 --> 25:24.741
No.

25:24.913 --> 25:27.582
- No, you can't make me, Abby.
- I don't want to make you.

25:27.749 --> 25:32.078
- No, no, no.
- I want you to do it on your own.

25:46.516 --> 25:47.761
Thanks.

25:48.268 --> 25:50.225
There you go.

25:50.937 --> 25:52.597
I have to go to the bathroom.

25:52.772 --> 25:53.970
No!

25:54.148 --> 25:58.525
I can order for myself. I can talk
for myself. I can pee for myself.

25:58.694 --> 26:00.152
Just...

26:02.447 --> 26:06.195
I'm not a child. It's a bathroom.
What am I gonna do with myself?

26:06.367 --> 26:08.075
- Are you gonna follow me in?
- No.

26:08.244 --> 26:11.114
Don't expect a thank-you.

26:46.154 --> 26:48.526
We needed to start her medication.

26:48.698 --> 26:50.489
How long to reach therapeutic levels?

26:50.658 --> 26:52.567
Tomorrow night.
It's 10 hours to Chicago.

26:52.743 --> 26:54.403
I know. I'll take her to my house.

26:54.578 --> 26:57.330
- I'll get her to Psych Monday.
- Are you working on Monday?

26:57.497 --> 27:01.162
- No, I'll switch shifts.
- Well, what about Monday night?

27:01.668 --> 27:04.455
- Luka, I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Why?

27:04.629 --> 27:07.380
- I'll call you back.
- Rena. No, no. Wait. Because-

27:07.548 --> 27:09.790
- Where'd she go?
- You're misinterpreting this.

27:09.967 --> 27:10.998
- What?
- My mother.

27:16.181 --> 27:18.636
I thought I locked that door.

27:19.935 --> 27:22.223
I unlocked it.

27:22.812 --> 27:24.769
- Okay.
- I needed some air.

27:24.939 --> 27:27.560
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:29.819 --> 27:32.226
See that family down there?

27:32.404 --> 27:34.195
Right down there.

27:34.364 --> 27:40.070
There's two little boys over there.
They're fighting by the pool.

27:40.995 --> 27:46.950
Do you see them?

27:49.378 --> 27:52.581
And I think that must be their parents
over there, having a cocktail.

27:53.549 --> 27:56.335
I watch people like that for hours.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.552
People doing their marketing...

27:59.846 --> 28:04.057
...and tying their shoes.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.427
Just doing routine things
that probably bore them to tears.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.561
I think how lucky they are.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.773
They have...

28:19.948 --> 28:22.948
- They have ordinary lives.
- You could be like them.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.869
- I could never be like them.
- Yes, if you took your medication.

28:26.036 --> 28:28.706
I tried.
I did everything I could think of.

28:28.872 --> 28:33.036
I got married. I had two kids.

28:38.756 --> 28:42.255
I tried to fool everyone
that I was just like them.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.928
God, why did you come, Abby?

28:55.188 --> 28:57.940
Because you needed me.

29:03.112 --> 29:06.113
There's no one here to save.

29:11.828 --> 29:13.785
You want me to talk to her?

29:14.497 --> 29:15.742
What would you say?

29:15.915 --> 29:18.620
That I asked you to come help me
with my mother.

29:18.793 --> 29:21.710
- You didn't ask me to come.
- Send her some flowers.

29:21.879 --> 29:24.251
I'm sure it'll be fine.

29:24.465 --> 29:26.671
- I don't think so.
- She's young.

29:26.842 --> 29:30.092
If you get involved with a teenager,
you have to expect drama.

29:30.262 --> 29:33.262
- We broke up.
- You broke up?

29:33.431 --> 29:34.510
- She broke up.
- When?

29:34.682 --> 29:37.304
- Last night.
- Over a basketball game?

29:39.061 --> 29:41.054
Over you.

29:41.230 --> 29:42.393
That's silly.

29:42.857 --> 29:45.774
What does she think?
We're having an illicit affair or something?

29:45.943 --> 29:49.146
No. Just that I have a crush on you.

29:52.365 --> 29:55.366
It's not like the relationship
didn't have its obstacles.

29:55.535 --> 29:58.654
Yeah, but I wouldn't want you
to break up because of me.

29:58.829 --> 30:01.118
Face it. You're a home wrecker.

30:08.171 --> 30:09.665
Dr. Greene?

30:09.840 --> 30:12.128
- Hey, Malucci.
- Hey, I got you your cigars.

30:12.300 --> 30:16.048
- Great.
- Wow, she's a cute one! Look at her.

30:16.220 --> 30:19.174
You're gonna have to keep the boys
away. What's her name?

30:19.348 --> 30:22.053
- Ella.
- Hi, you're quite the heifer, aren't you?

30:22.226 --> 30:24.302
- Can I hold her?
- No.

30:24.478 --> 30:27.147
- I just washed my hands.
- Good for you, Dave.

30:27.314 --> 30:29.721
- Are you serious?
- I'll see you later.

30:29.899 --> 30:33.185
- Why can't I hold her?
- Go away, Dave.

30:33.361 --> 30:34.903
You owe me
$300 for the cigars.

30:37.490 --> 30:39.613
- What's the matter?
- My mother's coming.

30:39.783 --> 30:41.242
She just left.

30:41.410 --> 30:45.075
Yes. Well, she decided she wants
to come and help with her granddaughter.

30:45.289 --> 30:49.452
- We'll all get along famously.
- Yeah, we'll see.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.629
- How did she do?
- She was an angel.

30:53.796 --> 30:56.465
She didn't even cry
with the heel stick.

30:57.216 --> 30:59.505
Now she's gonna give her mother
a hard time.

30:59.677 --> 31:02.962
Well, if you don't feed her, she will.
I think she's hungry.

31:03.138 --> 31:05.711
The nurse said she'd walk me
through breast-feeding.

31:05.891 --> 31:08.049
I don't think Ella knows that.

31:09.227 --> 31:13.805
- I suppose I can wing it.
- Here we go. Oh, yeah.

31:14.899 --> 31:18.149
- Here you go.
- Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

31:18.319 --> 31:22.398
Just try and keep the head
above the tummy. There you go.

31:22.573 --> 31:26.652
Mark. I don't know
whether I can do this, Mark.

31:26.826 --> 31:28.735
Yes, you can.
It just takes patience.

31:28.912 --> 31:31.699
No, I mean... I mean...

31:31.873 --> 31:36.250
I know. I know what you mean.
You're gonna be great.

31:49.973 --> 31:51.431
Can I help you?

31:51.599 --> 31:53.757
- Looks like you got a leak, ma'am.
- What?

31:53.934 --> 31:57.019
Yeah. Here's your problem.
You must have run over a nail.

31:57.313 --> 32:00.266
- But it just started hissing.
- I can patch that for you.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.100
- Fifteen dollars.
- You did that.

32:02.275 --> 32:03.935
Because I saw it,
doesn't mean I did it.

32:04.110 --> 32:06.103
- You put that in the tire.
- What's the problem?

32:06.279 --> 32:09.695
He popped the tire and thinks I don't
know about cars because I'm a woman.

32:09.866 --> 32:11.573
You want me to fix it? Ten bucks.

32:11.742 --> 32:14.494
- His price is going down.
- Fix it before we call the cops.

32:14.662 --> 32:17.579
- Five bucks?
- Negotiating with me now?

32:18.540 --> 32:20.082
Mom?

32:23.712 --> 32:25.289
Mom?

32:25.463 --> 32:26.792
Mom!

32:28.591 --> 32:30.215
- What?
- What are you doing?

32:31.969 --> 32:33.594
I'm hungry.

32:34.138 --> 32:36.130
- You're hungry?
- Yeah.

32:38.058 --> 32:40.300
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- You all right?

32:41.394 --> 32:43.434
Do you want something to eat?

32:45.190 --> 32:46.388
- No.
- What?

32:46.566 --> 32:47.597
No. Here.

32:47.775 --> 32:48.973
- What's that?
- Egg salad.

32:49.152 --> 32:51.477
- It's disgusting.
- Not as disgusting as Twinkies.

32:51.654 --> 32:54.857
- I don't want it.
- And a veggie burrito.

32:57.326 --> 32:59.152
You're getting a Slurpee.

32:59.661 --> 33:01.700
- And some Twinkies.
- Anything else?

33:01.871 --> 33:03.828
Yeah. A pack of light cigarettes.

33:04.624 --> 33:07.031
- That's a nasty habit.
- I know that.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.498
You should take better care
of yourself.

33:09.670 --> 33:11.663
$9.49.

33:32.524 --> 33:36.059
- Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
- She was pretty close to traffic.

33:36.236 --> 33:38.561
It's hard not to overreact sometimes.

33:38.738 --> 33:40.446
She seems better today.

33:42.283 --> 33:44.856
- She couldn't really be worse.
- All done.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.528
All right. I'm gonna pay Paco
his three bucks.

33:48.706 --> 33:50.449
I'll bring the car around.

33:53.961 --> 33:55.371
Coming!

33:59.549 --> 34:01.008
- You all set?
- Yeah.

34:02.635 --> 34:05.340
- How much longer to Chicago?
- Two or three hours.

34:05.930 --> 34:08.884
Abby, thank you for coming.

34:12.186 --> 34:14.308
Good news. They haven't given your
room away.

34:14.478 --> 34:15.855
- Frank's calling a cab. Right?
- Right.

34:16.773 --> 34:19.893
Don't take any Coumadin tonight.
Take 4 milligrams tomorrow.

34:20.068 --> 34:23.733
- And I am going to see you on Friday.
- - Thank you, Peter.

34:23.905 --> 34:25.777
You're welcome.

34:25.947 --> 34:29.150
I'm impressed. I talked to everyone
at his board and care.

34:29.326 --> 34:30.701
They all refused to take him.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.786
Oh, yeah? Well, I promised to go by
and do his blood test.

34:33.955 --> 34:37.158
Every other day? Since when
does Peter Benton give home care?

34:37.333 --> 34:39.824
Yeah. Well, you know what?
I owe that guy.

34:40.003 --> 34:42.540
He must've done something for you
to make house calls.

34:42.713 --> 34:45.335
He was my science teacher.
I should have been expelled.

34:45.507 --> 34:47.465
He gave me a month's detention instead.

34:47.635 --> 34:49.757
Expelled? What did you do?
Blow the place up?

34:49.928 --> 34:52.632
Almost. I had to prep the experiments
the night before.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.964
And it changed how
I thought about things.

34:55.141 --> 34:57.264
How I looked at school,
science, everything.

34:57.435 --> 34:59.511
- Did you ever tell him?
- No.

35:01.105 --> 35:03.643
- What was that for?
- School, science, everything.

35:04.275 --> 35:05.733
- You did not.
- I did.

35:05.901 --> 35:07.941
- You did not.
- Why would I make that up?

35:08.112 --> 35:10.187
You got a perm?

35:11.698 --> 35:13.240
- Twice.
- Twice?

35:14.242 --> 35:17.159
What? It was junior high school.

35:17.537 --> 35:18.699
That was the style.

35:18.871 --> 35:20.615
I don't know what planet
you grew up on...

35:20.790 --> 35:23.625
...but I do not remember perms
on boys ever being popular.

35:23.793 --> 35:26.034
Yes, it was. Jenny Butler liked it.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.212
- I'd like to see pictures of it.
- I think I burned them all.

35:30.632 --> 35:31.912
Twice!

35:32.634 --> 35:35.884
So that means you thought
it looked good the first time.

35:36.638 --> 35:40.469
As far as youthful transgressions go,
I think it scores pretty low on the scale.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.052
If you say so.

35:46.647 --> 35:49.731
- Is she still out?
- Yeah.

35:51.318 --> 35:54.852
- I think you'll be all right by yourself.
- I should be.

35:56.781 --> 35:59.486
I really want to thank you again
for doing this.

36:03.621 --> 36:05.079
You didn't have to.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.156
- I'd never seen Oklahoma.
- No.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.830
I mean it.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.460
Well, I'll help you inside.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.097
Okay, Mom. We're here.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.670
Mom?

36:26.850 --> 36:28.973
Wake up. We have to go inside.

36:30.812 --> 36:31.843
Mom?

36:35.441 --> 36:37.434
Mom? Mom?

36:37.610 --> 36:38.855
John!

36:39.779 --> 36:41.688
- What?
- She's not waking up.

36:44.032 --> 36:46.654
Maggie? Maggie, can you hear me?

36:46.827 --> 36:48.107
Maggie!

36:48.286 --> 36:50.113
- Pupils are dilated.
- How much?

36:50.413 --> 36:52.370
Nine millimeters.
Did she take something?

36:52.540 --> 36:54.698
- Sit her up.
- Did you see her take something?

36:54.876 --> 36:55.990
- She's tachy.
- Oh, God!

36:56.169 --> 36:58.291
- Pulse is 130.
- God!

36:59.213 --> 37:01.122
- No head injury.
- She took something.

37:01.298 --> 37:03.623
- Where'd she get it from?
- Call the paramedics!

37:06.053 --> 37:07.215
What are you doing?

37:07.387 --> 37:09.380
We can be there
before they can get here.

37:09.556 --> 37:13.470
Come on, shut that door.
Keep her chin up. Keep her airway open.

37:24.528 --> 37:27.943
Chuny, pull an intubation kit,
get a vent, NG and charcoal.

37:28.114 --> 37:29.277
What size ET?

37:29.449 --> 37:31.026
Seven and a half. She's little.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.656
- They're here.
- Okay. And get her a unit bed!

37:33.828 --> 37:35.701
- Turn her head if she vomits.
- She's cyanotic.

37:35.871 --> 37:37.698
- Glasgow?
- Negative 15, 2-2-4.

37:37.873 --> 37:38.904
- Got her?
- Yeah. Go.

37:39.083 --> 37:41.159
Not anymore.
She's completely unresponsive.

37:41.335 --> 37:42.793
Get a mask going at 10 liters.

37:43.003 --> 37:45.541
Breaths are shallow,
but I think her airway's clear.

37:45.714 --> 37:48.121
CBC, Chem-20,
blood and urine tox screens.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.790
BP, 90/60.

37:51.386 --> 37:53.177
QRS complexes look wide.

37:53.346 --> 37:54.840
- Get a 12-lead.
- NG tube.

37:55.014 --> 37:56.472
Hold on.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.721
She's got no gag reflex.

38:02.771 --> 38:05.013
- One of Pavulon, 90 of sux.
- Look at this.

38:05.190 --> 38:08.226
- What?
- Diphenhydramine, 25 milligrams.

38:08.401 --> 38:10.726
- How many are missing?
- All of them.

38:10.903 --> 38:13.655
Twelve to a sheet. Three sheets.

38:13.823 --> 38:16.195
Twenty-five times 36.

38:16.742 --> 38:19.696
- That's 900 milligrams.
- Okay. Stand by with bicarb.

38:19.870 --> 38:21.743
Hurry up, Carter.

38:21.913 --> 38:23.621
Give me some cricoid pressure.

38:24.165 --> 38:26.917
Charcoal after intubation.
Abby, you want to be in here?

38:27.126 --> 38:28.918
QRS complex is 0. 16.

38:30.004 --> 38:32.080
- Push the bicarb.
- Okay, I'm in.

38:33.716 --> 38:35.126
Abby?

38:36.927 --> 38:38.338
I'm okay.

38:38.929 --> 38:41.052
19-year-old male. Passed out
from multiple shots of tequila.

38:41.223 --> 38:43.132
- Wasn't breathing.
- How long was he down?

38:43.308 --> 38:45.300
- A long time.
- What's the writing?

38:45.477 --> 38:48.098
His frat brothers did it.
They were trying to clean it.

38:48.312 --> 38:50.519
- Peter splinted this guy.
- I can't get a pulse.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.896
- Nothing from the neck.
- Was this your patient?

38:53.067 --> 38:55.225
- He's in V-tach!
- Charge the portable paddles!

38:55.402 --> 38:57.062
- What happened?
- Too much to drink.

38:57.237 --> 38:58.815
- Charged to 200.
- Clear!

38:58.989 --> 39:00.531
Clear.

39:00.949 --> 39:02.988
- How much?
- They were having a contest.

39:03.159 --> 39:05.615
- Is someone coming in?
- They're all pretty drunk.

39:05.787 --> 39:06.818
- Okay.
- Still V-tach!

39:06.996 --> 39:08.739
Charge again. Amp of epi. Come on.

39:08.915 --> 39:10.373
- Clear.
- Clear.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.201
No change, 100 of lidocaine.

39:12.376 --> 39:13.954
Let's charge to 360.

39:14.128 --> 39:15.622
Get him on the gurney.

39:15.796 --> 39:18.880
- He's young. We can get him back.
- All right, here we go. Clear!

39:19.299 --> 39:20.378
Deteriorated to V-fib.

39:20.550 --> 39:23.634
Let's get somebody from that fraternity.
Find out what happened.

39:25.138 --> 39:27.177
- Got more bicarb.
- Put an amp in.

39:27.348 --> 39:29.175
- Charcoal is in.
- I need vent settings.

39:29.350 --> 39:32.719
Tidal volume, 600.
AC of 12 on 100%.

39:32.895 --> 39:36.678
- Pressure's down to 80 after two liters.
- Start dopamine at 10 mics.

39:37.357 --> 39:40.808
Antihistamine overdose
can give you myocardial pump failure.

39:40.986 --> 39:43.357
Did she have sleeping pills with her?

39:45.156 --> 39:48.026
- I need another lomed for the drip.
- Where'd she get them?

39:48.242 --> 39:50.235
Call X-ray. We need a portable chest.

39:50.411 --> 39:52.699
She's hyper-reflexic.
Is the tox screen back?

39:52.871 --> 39:54.698
- She's seizing!
- Watch the tube!

39:56.917 --> 40:00.332
- Pulse ox is dropping. Check the O-2.
- We're bagging at 100%.

40:00.503 --> 40:03.041
Hold on. Hold on.
Her finger probe fell off.

40:03.214 --> 40:04.589
Help me keep her head steady.

40:04.757 --> 40:06.631
- Help me keep her head steady.
- Hold on.

40:06.801 --> 40:09.636
- Ativan's on board.
- Another four?

40:09.803 --> 40:11.760
Give it a minute to work.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.102
Still fib.

40:27.570 --> 40:30.903
- Pulse ox down to 72.
- All right.

40:31.073 --> 40:33.480
Push another epi. Shock again.

40:34.534 --> 40:35.910
His friend is here.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.158
Not you again.

40:40.331 --> 40:43.000
Adam's pledging Upsilon Psi Lambda.
I'm his big brother.

40:43.251 --> 40:45.920
- How much did you make him drink?
- He drank on his own.

40:46.087 --> 40:48.756
- How much did you make him drink?
-35 shots, maybe 40.

40:48.922 --> 40:50.630
Clear!

40:51.800 --> 40:53.378
Asystole.

40:53.552 --> 40:57.086
A milligram of atropine.
And set up the pacing pads. Come on.

40:57.263 --> 41:01.095
Blood alcohol is 0.529. Tox screen:
Negative for marijuana, cocaine, opiates.

41:01.267 --> 41:02.642
Adam wouldn't touch drugs.

41:02.810 --> 41:04.886
- Ready to pace.
- Rate of a hundred.

41:05.062 --> 41:08.098
- Aren't you gonna shock him again?
- You can't shock a flatline.

41:08.273 --> 41:11.642
- You only shocked him once.
- We've shocked him for 40 minutes.

41:11.818 --> 41:14.190
No capture, no pulse.

41:17.449 --> 41:19.904
Time of death, 2023. Here.

41:20.952 --> 41:22.362
You gotta help him.

41:22.787 --> 41:26.618
His heart's been deprived
of oxygen too long. He's gone.

41:32.045 --> 41:34.085
Here. Clean him up.

41:34.756 --> 41:37.211
- What?
- You and your friends.

41:37.383 --> 41:41.132
- You wrote this on him, right?
- Yeah. But it was just a joke.

41:42.471 --> 41:46.682
- I hope you got a good laugh out of it.
- We didn't know this was gonna happen.

41:46.850 --> 41:49.970
You're his big brother.
You're supposed to look out for him.

41:50.145 --> 41:52.268
He drank voluntary-

41:52.439 --> 41:54.597
Just shut up, all right?

41:54.774 --> 41:57.182
You get over there and you clean him up.

42:03.657 --> 42:06.362
Hey, Maggie? Maggie,
can you squeeze my hand?

42:06.535 --> 42:09.452
- She's not waking up.
- CT said they can take you on the way.

42:09.621 --> 42:11.993
- She's got a unit bed?
-2102.

42:12.165 --> 42:13.707
- You want to call Psych?
- No.

42:13.875 --> 42:15.867
- She's on a hold.
- They can't talk to her.

42:16.044 --> 42:18.534
Pressure's holding.
You want to finish the Dilantin?

42:18.713 --> 42:21.334
Yes. Have them check her level
in an hour.

42:21.507 --> 42:24.294
I want her on a hold
when she wakes up.

42:24.468 --> 42:26.674
She might not wake up.

42:40.608 --> 42:41.687
Dr. Benton.

42:42.484 --> 42:43.729
Dr. Benton.

42:45.988 --> 42:48.525
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- Is this a bad time?

42:49.324 --> 42:53.452
No. I just had to tell a father in Iowa
that he lost his son.

42:54.329 --> 42:56.950
- So it is a bad time.
- What can I do for you?

42:57.415 --> 43:00.166
I wanted to let you know
I was accepted into med school.

43:00.334 --> 43:02.659
Yeah, I know. I know.
Congratulations.

43:03.212 --> 43:06.082
- I want to thank you for your help.
- You deserved it.

43:06.423 --> 43:09.626
It wouldn't have been an option
if you hadn't gone out of your way.

43:09.801 --> 43:14.712
Look, don't thank me.
Just work your ass off, all right?

43:43.624 --> 43:45.367
They extubated her?

43:48.044 --> 43:50.713
She woke up
and started fighting the vent.

43:51.923 --> 43:53.500
Her vitals are normal.

43:54.133 --> 43:56.090
Did you get a hold?

43:59.221 --> 44:01.260
Legaspi saw her.

44:05.936 --> 44:08.011
I thought I was watching her
every second.

44:08.188 --> 44:10.346
That's not possible.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.350
I should have listened to you.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.486
She'll be okay.

44:23.243 --> 44:25.152
She'll never be okay.
