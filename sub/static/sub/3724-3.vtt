00:01.135 --> 00:03.306
Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:04.338 --> 00:06.192
Okay, come on, let's go, people.

00:06.217 --> 00:09.952
You get cash bonuses for nudity, 911 calls,

00:09.977 --> 00:11.010
cat fights, all right?

00:11.012 --> 00:13.045
Get me some good TV.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.914
You're very lucky that your stunt

00:14.916 --> 00:16.282
got me booyah ratings last season.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.616
I need your head in the game.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.793
You could just get the
show to drop the charges.

00:19.818 --> 00:21.084
You guys got the car back,

00:21.109 --> 00:23.743
and I'm... and I'm paying
off all the damages.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.768
Anna Martin's father's in the I.C.U.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.354
- Your dad had a heart thing this morning.
- I have to go home.

00:28.379 --> 00:30.526
I'm just asking about a
few more hours here, okay?

00:30.551 --> 00:32.198
He's dead.

00:32.447 --> 00:34.481
- Husband.
- What are you doing here?

00:34.506 --> 00:36.046
- Did you miss me?
- Always.

00:36.071 --> 00:37.632
- Cynthia.
- Hey.

00:37.657 --> 00:39.710
You look incredible. I'm pregnant.

00:39.951 --> 00:42.179
Were you not going to tell me?

00:42.204 --> 00:43.524
It's not what it looks like.

00:43.549 --> 00:45.888
I am done being the side-wife,

00:45.913 --> 00:48.247
and I am not waiting for you anymore.

00:48.249 --> 00:48.905
Quinn.

00:48.930 --> 00:50.805
Screw this and screw you.

00:51.116 --> 00:53.329
Bethany. You owe me
three months' back rent.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.296
Here's your stuff. Except
your laptop, that is.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.804
You have 24 hours to pay me or
the MacBook goes on Craigslist.

00:57.829 --> 00:59.882
No. There's things on there
that could hurt people.

00:59.907 --> 01:00.967
Great reason to pay me.

01:00.992 --> 01:03.172
I read your unsent sappy love e-mail.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.443
Bethany, stop. Jeremy
is engaged to Lizzie now.

01:05.468 --> 01:07.335
I also found the crew list.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.585
Pay me by 10:00 P.M. or it
goes live to all of them.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.340
Hello, ladies.

01:18.365 --> 01:20.832
So, this afternoon kicks
off as all good dates do...

01:20.865 --> 01:21.863
with a cocktail party

01:21.888 --> 01:24.746
during which three of you will be chosen

01:24.771 --> 01:26.840
as guests for an intimate, romantic dinner.

01:26.865 --> 01:29.660
And out of those three, one
lucky lady will be selected

01:29.684 --> 01:33.363
to enjoy a day-long date with yours truly.

01:33.504 --> 01:35.471
I won't be picking the winner

01:35.496 --> 01:37.410
Or making any of the choices, in fact.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.168
I'm leaving all of that to
my best mate, Roger Lockwood.

01:40.254 --> 01:42.644
Roger, come on in and say hello.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.792
Well, thank you for having me here.

01:44.818 --> 01:47.309
From looking around, I can
see that Adam is one lucky man.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.238
No one knows me better than
Roger. He's like family.

01:49.263 --> 01:51.542
I know what he likes in
a woman and what he needs.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.099
And that's a cut.

01:53.124 --> 01:56.154
- Okay, ladies, you can relax, have some water...
- Hey, um, let's get interviews

01:56.179 --> 01:58.012
on Maya, Athena, and Mary.

01:58.037 --> 02:00.263
- Copy.
- Okay, Adam, you can take 10.

02:01.119 --> 02:02.452
What?

02:02.477 --> 02:04.458
- Do you have something to say to me, or... ?
- No, no.

02:04.483 --> 02:05.575
I was... I was just reflecting

02:05.601 --> 02:07.214
on how broad-shouldered
Jeremy looks today.

02:07.238 --> 02:09.161
Oh, doesn't he, though? But still tender.

02:09.186 --> 02:10.279
I know.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.662
Hey, do I have to remind you

02:11.687 --> 02:13.119
that I have the power to make or break you

02:13.144 --> 02:14.506
on national television?

02:14.530 --> 02:16.888
Oh, come on. That stuff
you wrote to Jeremy...

02:16.913 --> 02:18.576
which you're a filthy girl, by the way...

02:18.601 --> 02:20.469
- people have to be able to take the piss out of you...
- People.

02:20.494 --> 02:22.192
- Yeah.
- Not you.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.021
- Got it?
- All right.

02:24.046 --> 02:24.978
Good.

02:32.650 --> 02:35.630
So, get bikinis and abs and...

02:35.655 --> 02:37.935
Wow, somebody get some bronzer

02:37.960 --> 02:40.248
and slap it on Roger's pasty ass.

02:40.273 --> 02:42.680
Can I get eyes on Adam, please?

02:42.705 --> 02:45.968
I think he's in wardrobe.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074

Oh, God. Oh.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.966
Oh, my God!

03:05.464 --> 03:08.039
Oh.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.357
Hey. Uh...

03:23.382 --> 03:25.190
Okay, it's all good.

03:25.215 --> 03:27.903
But you of all people should
understand a little on-set romance.

03:27.929 --> 03:29.561
Don't. Don't. Don't do that. Don't. Stop.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.520
Honestly, what were you thinking?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.933
Not a lot of thinking going on, I'm afraid.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.693
Clearly. It's just sort of old habits.

03:35.718 --> 03:38.619
And with Grace, I mean, I don't know
what they teach in South America, but...

03:38.644 --> 03:40.177
- Okay, you know what?
- It's like...

03:40.202 --> 03:41.842
sorry, no, I won't bore
you with any of this.

03:41.867 --> 03:44.300
Just do me a favor and
keep it in the pants, okay?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.092
Prince Charming...

03:45.117 --> 03:47.389
he doesn't get his knob
polished until he's in love.

03:47.457 --> 03:49.290
Hey, Rachel, I've got your paycheck.

03:49.315 --> 03:50.481
Thank you.

03:50.865 --> 03:52.882
- Man. We got to tell everybody.
- Rach...

03:52.907 --> 03:54.594
Hey, whatever you guys are about to say,

03:54.619 --> 03:55.422
I don't want to hear it.

03:55.447 --> 03:58.233
Well, I was just about to
tell you about Carl. Our D.P.?

03:58.816 --> 04:01.858
He's leaving, shooting
an indie in New York.

04:01.919 --> 04:04.241
- Hey, Sam, I need you to look at this.
- Eh. Yeah, I'll be right there.

04:04.266 --> 04:05.514
Oh, and here at last

04:05.539 --> 04:08.568
is our very own miss Austen if your nasty.

04:08.593 --> 04:11.304
"Dear Mr. Darcy, how much longer... "

04:11.328 --> 04:13.014
thank you.

04:13.563 --> 04:15.917
My, my, my, Goldberg, your love letter

04:15.942 --> 04:18.038
sure has everyone around
here all hot and bothered.

04:18.063 --> 04:18.999
Mm-hmm.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.202
Um, by the way, Adam's Mike was open,

04:21.226 --> 04:24.210
and the sound guys say that
Grace is a dirty talker,

04:24.235 --> 04:25.116
just like you.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.623
Yeah, well, I found them. It's over.

04:26.649 --> 04:28.554
Yeah, you're right it's over.

04:28.578 --> 04:31.350
Sluts get cut. All right?

04:31.375 --> 04:33.632
Nobody wants to take
them home to their mommy.

04:33.657 --> 04:35.484
Grace is dead wifey walking.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.822
But you need to work on your girl Maya.

04:37.847 --> 04:39.382
I think that she's been laying low,

04:39.407 --> 04:40.715
but she has wife potential.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.061
But she's gonna need some prodding,

04:42.086 --> 04:44.553
so you need to get that one-on-one
time with Adam right away.

04:44.578 --> 04:47.280
And she's a sommelier, classy, you got it.

04:47.305 --> 04:50.741
So then go and do it now!

04:50.766 --> 04:52.757
You, too! Go with her now!

04:52.782 --> 04:54.029
You, get out of my seat.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.253
Yes, ma'am.

04:55.278 --> 04:57.163
- Rachel.
- Hmm?

04:57.188 --> 05:00.331
You sure are a little lightning
rod for drama aren't you?

05:01.664 --> 05:04.432
It's a perfect time for
you to disappear somewhere.

05:04.457 --> 05:06.608
Clock out. You're into triple overtime.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.780
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. No, no, no.

05:08.805 --> 05:09.936
This is a big date.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.413
You're not gonna let me
produce my girls, seriously?

05:12.438 --> 05:14.999
No, that was a rookie mistake
letting Adam out of your sight.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.291
So, what, are you punishing me
now? Is that what you're doing?

05:17.316 --> 05:18.843
You need sleep, okay?

05:18.867 --> 05:20.065
You're getting those crazy eyes again.

05:20.091 --> 05:21.242
You're no good to me like this.

05:21.267 --> 05:23.467
Quinn, Chet's looking for you.

05:23.664 --> 05:25.475
Crazy eyes?

05:25.500 --> 05:26.464
Maybe 'cause of this.

05:26.489 --> 05:27.872
It's $189.

05:27.897 --> 05:29.712
Last season's meltdown wasn't cheap.

05:29.737 --> 05:32.944
That's why we can't
afford another one, okay?

05:32.969 --> 05:34.905
Chet, can I get you to sign this?

05:35.302 --> 05:37.342
Got amazing plans for the weekend?

05:37.367 --> 05:39.530
It's Tuesday. I know that.

05:40.005 --> 05:42.092
I don't know. Tuesday's halfway there.

05:42.117 --> 05:44.292
Um, hey, you.

05:44.317 --> 05:46.183
You're the one with the dad, right?

05:46.208 --> 05:47.203
Well...

05:47.229 --> 05:48.797
Uh, yes. Yeah.

05:49.579 --> 05:51.579
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.401
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

05:54.755 --> 05:58.100
Well, he... he had a lot
of health issues, so...

05:58.235 --> 06:01.046
What, he smoke cigarettes?
'Cause those things'll kill you.

06:01.071 --> 06:03.938
No, actually, it was pot.

06:03.962 --> 06:06.565
He's, uh... he was a huge stoner.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.902
Oh. That's...

06:08.927 --> 06:10.406
Not good.

06:10.431 --> 06:11.446
No.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.486
How old was he?

06:13.639 --> 06:17.920
Um... Oh, he was 48.

06:21.809 --> 06:23.242
Okay.

06:24.521 --> 06:26.294
- But seriously...
- Hmm?

06:26.319 --> 06:29.236
Go to the beach or something,
'cause you look like crap.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.343
Okay, that's not happening.

06:30.368 --> 06:33.169
I mean, I can't drive.
I don't have any money.

06:33.194 --> 06:35.431
I mean, I have a D.U.I. do you remember?

06:35.456 --> 06:38.191
Are you seeing this? What is that?

06:38.216 --> 06:40.216
Looks like somebody's going on a binge.

06:40.241 --> 06:42.575
And that is her marker food.

06:42.607 --> 06:44.336
What's a marker?

06:44.736 --> 06:46.155
So, she knows when to stop

06:46.180 --> 06:47.643
when the orange comes back up.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.145
It means she got everything else out.

06:49.171 --> 06:50.637
It's a classic trick.

06:50.662 --> 06:52.529
Go get rid of them, and then get lost.

06:52.554 --> 06:54.253
I don't want to see you after that.

06:54.561 --> 06:56.002
Yeah, but if she doesn't have her marker,

06:56.027 --> 06:57.834
she's gonna hurl till
she pukes her brains out.

06:57.859 --> 07:00.002
So? Our girls find our villain

07:00.028 --> 07:02.975
on the bathroom floor in
a pool of her own puke.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.900
It's good TV.

07:10.808 --> 07:12.174
Grace.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.014
Grace. Grace, hey, listen to me.

07:15.039 --> 07:18.406
Look, I think that women should
have any kind of sex they like,

07:18.431 --> 07:19.718
but if you want to win Adam,

07:19.743 --> 07:21.254
you're just gonna have to change your act.

07:21.279 --> 07:22.725
Okay? Around here, sluts get cut.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.015
Whoa! I'm a slut?

07:25.122 --> 07:27.923
You should talk. That
letter you wrote was...

07:27.948 --> 07:30.319
Right, see, but I'm not on the show.

07:30.344 --> 07:32.948
Season 3, Brandy snuck
into Jason's room naked.

07:32.973 --> 07:34.473
That night, she's on a plane.

07:34.498 --> 07:36.523
You just don't want Adam to be with me.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.036
I've seen the way you look at him.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.875
Grace, come on, you're one of my girls.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.035
You win this thing, and
it's a win for me, too.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.819
If I could have your attention, please.

07:48.844 --> 07:53.366
Um, as you all may know,
our D.P. Here is leaving us.

07:53.391 --> 07:54.991
Going to the big show, New York.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.054
And I couldn't be happier for him.

07:57.078 --> 07:59.062
To Carl! To Carl.

07:59.338 --> 08:02.773
Okay, everybody, back to work.

08:05.778 --> 08:09.385
What? Think that should be you?

08:09.410 --> 08:12.078
No. I mean, the money would be good.

08:12.103 --> 08:14.103
Rachel said you're too good for this place.

08:14.543 --> 08:16.710
I told you, we hooked up once.

08:16.735 --> 08:18.726
And you know how much I regret it.

08:18.751 --> 08:20.262
- Hooked up?
- Yeah.

08:20.295 --> 08:21.678
She was in love with you.

08:21.703 --> 08:23.897
And it kind of sounds like
you were in love with her, too.

08:23.923 --> 08:24.985
According to Rachel,

08:25.010 --> 08:27.303
you talked about quitting and
moving to New York together.

08:27.328 --> 08:31.063
We were drunk. We... we said a lot of shit.

08:31.088 --> 08:33.087
So, you're saying you
never even thought about it.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.144
- Thought about... ?
- You never thought about leaving,

08:35.169 --> 08:37.062
D.P.ING movies like Carl.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.846
I mean, yeah, of course. Who wouldn't?

08:39.871 --> 08:43.686
I'm a... I'm gonna cam-op
on a reality TV show.

08:43.711 --> 08:45.780
See, because you never said
anything like that to me.

08:46.949 --> 08:48.949
I thought this was what you wanted.

08:49.389 --> 08:51.365
We're getting married, Jeremy.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.762
You said that we're
buying a house together.

08:52.787 --> 08:55.739
W-w-we still are. Lizzie, Lizzie.

08:55.764 --> 08:58.286
You're making way too big
of a deal out of this thing.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.121
Jeremy, I am so sorry, okay?

09:22.146 --> 09:23.313
And I am so mortified.

09:23.352 --> 09:25.674
I-I-I owed my roommate,
like, all of this money,

09:25.698 --> 09:27.535
and so she... she... she
took my computer hostage,

09:27.560 --> 09:29.579
- and so when I didn't get the money...
- God, there's always some story with you, Rach.

09:29.604 --> 09:31.918
Is that why you screwed over
Anna? I saw last night's episode.

09:31.943 --> 09:34.301
- Yes, and I mean...
- The girl's father died, you made her look like a psycho.

09:34.326 --> 09:37.168
I never would have done that, okay?
But I had to get the money to Bethany.

09:37.193 --> 09:39.067
- It was too late, obviously.
- Don't your rich-ass parents live across town?

09:39.092 --> 09:42.160
Couldn't you ask them for money? But, no,
Quinn chums the water, and you're right there.

09:42.185 --> 09:43.113
It's not that simple, okay?

09:43.138 --> 09:44.623
Going home... it's not a good situation.

09:44.648 --> 09:46.679
- You know that. I just... I...
- It can't be worse than here.

09:46.704 --> 09:48.598
Look, Rach, you talk a good game, but...

09:48.623 --> 09:50.594
I think you like it.

09:50.619 --> 09:52.170
Don't you?

09:53.086 --> 09:55.451
No, of course I don't like it.

09:55.751 --> 09:59.803
That crap about Quinn forcing your hand?

09:59.828 --> 10:01.322
You've got a meal ticket out.

10:01.347 --> 10:04.131
You wouldn't be here if you
didn't like the taste of blood.

10:40.290 --> 10:42.791
Rachel, it's mom again.
Call me back, please.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.683
This is the fourth
message I've left for you.

10:54.055 --> 10:57.133
A nap, really?

10:57.158 --> 10:59.253
Oh, lunch was just too exhausting?

10:59.519 --> 11:02.405
You know that girl's father
was two years older than me?

11:02.430 --> 11:03.823
He drops dead.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.816
Yeah, he had a history. You don't.

11:07.062 --> 11:10.791
We have too much stress.
We're working too hard.

11:10.816 --> 11:12.855
No, I'm working too hard.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.081
You're busy getting your wife
knocked up and getting loaded.

11:18.773 --> 11:20.139
Come here.

11:20.164 --> 11:21.496
No, I have a budget meeting,

11:21.521 --> 11:23.121
and I have to go over these numbers.

11:24.364 --> 11:26.322
Cancel it.

11:26.803 --> 11:30.338
You need a break. Come here. Please.

11:40.426 --> 11:44.429
Get off of it. Get off the couch. Go on.

11:58.784 --> 12:04.074
You're the only thing in my
life that I've ever done right.

12:05.556 --> 12:08.457
Don't get all sentimental.

12:08.482 --> 12:12.080
You've done me, all
right... six ways to Sunday.

12:12.105 --> 12:16.340
That's not what I meant. You know it.

12:25.248 --> 12:27.615
Margaritas, senoritas?

12:31.991 --> 12:33.693
Hey, I'm off the clock. I've got my cell

12:33.717 --> 12:35.373
but I'm just gonna go crash, okay?

12:35.398 --> 12:37.292
What, don't you mean hide, hard core?

12:37.317 --> 12:39.221
Aww.

12:39.246 --> 12:40.310
Don't worry about it.

12:40.335 --> 12:42.168
When the dragon's away, the mice will play.

12:42.193 --> 12:44.814
My girls are moving on up.

12:44.839 --> 12:45.854
Bam!

12:59.267 --> 13:01.864
Really? Adam said that?

13:01.889 --> 13:02.552
He did.

13:02.577 --> 13:03.959
Adam wants to get to know you better.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.566
He thinks you're wife material.

13:05.591 --> 13:07.252
You're beautiful. You know wine.

13:07.277 --> 13:09.244
I mean, he's opening a
vineyard for God's sake.

13:10.066 --> 13:12.100
The problem is he doesn't
get to pick the next date.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.058
Roger does.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.549
Right, yeah. I-I know.

13:14.574 --> 13:17.915
And Roger is... Kind of a slut.

13:17.941 --> 13:19.645
Oh.

13:19.670 --> 13:22.876
- No, I'm... I'm not saying you have to do anything.
- Right.

13:22.901 --> 13:26.287
But, you know, if you want
that one-on-one date with Adam,

13:26.312 --> 13:28.663
you got to... You know, come
out of your shell a little bit.

13:28.688 --> 13:31.096
Right. Right. Yeah, okay.

13:31.121 --> 13:34.122
I-I brought liquid
courage, if you need it.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.735
I'll do one with you.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.064
Okay, let's do it.

13:38.737 --> 13:39.952
Oh, gosh.

13:39.977 --> 13:41.635
- Here goes.
- To you and Adam.

13:41.660 --> 13:42.620
Yes, to me and Adam.

13:42.645 --> 13:44.472
Okay.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.525
Oh.

13:48.177 --> 13:50.116
Okay. Now go. Go get your man.

13:50.141 --> 13:51.868
Okay. Here goes.

13:51.893 --> 13:53.300
Okay.

13:55.391 --> 13:57.029
Here you go.

13:57.054 --> 13:58.348
Thank you. And for you.

13:58.373 --> 13:59.195
Oh, no thank you.

13:59.219 --> 14:00.832
Oh, it's fantastic.

14:00.857 --> 14:02.677
Excusez-moi.

14:02.702 --> 14:05.625
Do you mind if I steal the boys for a bit?

14:05.650 --> 14:08.484
Oh, thank you. I'll see
you guys in a minute.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.877
Look at you.

14:33.422 --> 14:36.205
- Rachel.
- Hi, mom.

14:36.231 --> 14:38.949
Oh, so good to see you, honey.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.617
Yeah.

14:47.706 --> 14:52.324
Oh, I am so sorry that I've been so shy.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.633
I'm normally not like this in real life.

14:54.658 --> 14:57.418
- No? What are you like?
- Mnh-mnh.

14:57.443 --> 14:59.770
Mm... Actually, I'm a sommelier.

14:59.794 --> 15:01.327
I heard that. That's fantastic.

15:01.352 --> 15:02.447
I'm in the wine business.

15:02.472 --> 15:05.135
Well, I do live for a good drink.

15:05.160 --> 15:09.095
Good food, good... Company.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.821
You know, I'm a total hedonist.

15:11.846 --> 15:12.973
- Are you now?
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.998 --> 15:14.030
I like that.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.480
And I'm impressed that any girl here

15:15.505 --> 15:16.769
would actually know what that word means.

15:16.794 --> 15:19.194
You are so terrible, aren't you?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.119
Oh, he is.

15:21.144 --> 15:23.077
I don't think I'm drunk enough
to enjoy him yet, though.

15:23.102 --> 15:25.169
Only one way to solve that, eh?

15:25.194 --> 15:26.704
- Yes, you got to catch up.
- All right.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.113
All right. There you are.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.363
Thank you very much.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.237
To...

15:31.262 --> 15:32.614
Good company.

15:32.639 --> 15:34.473
- To good company.
- To good company.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.990
Cheers. Mm.

15:38.607 --> 15:40.240
To a good time.

15:42.835 --> 15:44.501
Hey, baby.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.226
Hi, dad.

15:47.508 --> 15:49.561
What a pleasant surprise.

15:49.586 --> 15:52.449
Rachel was just telling me about the new...

15:52.474 --> 15:54.442
new, um...

15:54.467 --> 15:55.625
What do you call them?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.643
- Suitor.
- Suitor, right.

15:57.668 --> 15:59.768
Ah.

16:00.477 --> 16:01.693
Oh!

16:01.718 --> 16:04.169
One of my students wrote
a paper on your show.

16:04.194 --> 16:05.627
Absolutely fascinating.

16:05.652 --> 16:08.019
Well, it is not my show.

16:08.044 --> 16:11.359
And I'm sure it is a doozy.

16:11.384 --> 16:13.630
I can't remember the exact title of it,

16:13.655 --> 16:15.007
but it examines

16:15.033 --> 16:17.501
the psychological effects of bully TV.

16:17.526 --> 16:19.659
And as it pertains to your show,

16:19.684 --> 16:23.686
the effects of viewing women... As chattel.

16:23.711 --> 16:25.551
That is awesome.

16:28.376 --> 16:30.401
I'm sorry. You feel judged, don't you?

16:30.426 --> 16:32.458
- Don't do that, mom.
- No, I know you know, so it's okay.

16:32.483 --> 16:36.785
Don't shrink me. Save it
for your patients, okay?

16:44.303 --> 16:45.669
Want some?

16:45.694 --> 16:48.458
What happened to you taking
better care of yourself?

16:48.483 --> 16:50.771
I am. That's the first of the day.

16:50.796 --> 16:53.063
I'm usually eight deep
by now. You know that.

16:53.088 --> 16:55.700
Mm. That is impressive.

16:56.862 --> 16:58.608
You want to know what else is impressive?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.896
- Oh.
- Huh? Huh?

17:02.921 --> 17:05.722
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You ready for round two?

17:05.747 --> 17:08.214
All right.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.778
Oh, okay, hold on. Hold on.

17:10.803 --> 17:12.303
Okay.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.344
Okay.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.935
And you wanted to go to a budget meeting.

17:19.961 --> 17:22.848
Oh, silly me. Silly me.

17:24.997 --> 17:26.703
Okay. Here we go.

17:26.728 --> 17:28.161
Oh, God.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.952
Mm. Okay.

17:31.978 --> 17:34.809
Chet. Let's forget the condom, okay?

17:34.833 --> 17:35.887
Let's just do it.

17:35.912 --> 17:37.495
Just do it, okay?

17:37.520 --> 17:40.106
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:40.131 --> 17:42.008
No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:42.033 --> 17:44.190
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry. Don't be. Don't be.

17:44.216 --> 17:46.665
Okay. All right. Come on.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.942
Yeah.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.366
Ah! Come on!

17:50.911 --> 17:53.302
Ah! Ohh!

17:53.327 --> 17:54.997
- My chest.
- What?

17:55.022 --> 17:56.622
- My chest.
- What?

17:56.647 --> 17:58.216
- My chest.
- What? What?

17:58.241 --> 17:59.685
Go on.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.068
My arm's tingling.

18:01.093 --> 18:03.826
What? Call 911. Call 911.

18:03.851 --> 18:06.045
- Aah! God.
- Okay, okay.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.779
Uh, okay, uh...

18:07.804 --> 18:09.083
No, no, no, no, no.

18:09.108 --> 18:10.662
Come on. Come on. Hi. Hi.

18:10.687 --> 18:12.651
Yeah, I-I-I need an ambulance.
I need an ambulance.

18:12.676 --> 18:16.990
Uh, a heart attack. Heart attack.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.609
And action.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.031
All right, Roger is finally ready to reveal

18:25.057 --> 18:26.266
the three lucky ladies

18:26.291 --> 18:29.522
that are gonna join Adam
and him on a romantic dinner.

18:29.547 --> 18:31.847
Good luck.

18:31.872 --> 18:34.770
Well, all of you are incredible,

18:34.795 --> 18:36.914
but we can only dine with three of you.

18:36.939 --> 18:38.638
And those three are...

18:38.663 --> 18:43.761
Grace, Anna, and Maya.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.880
And that's a cut. We're
gonna go again, ladies.

18:56.607 --> 18:59.107
Are you currently on any medication?

18:59.132 --> 19:00.758
Um...

19:00.784 --> 19:05.235
Ativan, Ambien, Cialis, and
Diovan for blood pressure.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.161
Any history of heart
disease in your family?

19:08.186 --> 19:09.302
Hmm?

19:09.327 --> 19:10.692
Oh, um...

19:10.717 --> 19:13.518
Your grandfather, Ted, on your mom's side.

19:17.384 --> 19:19.851
We should really call your wife.

19:21.068 --> 19:23.102
Oh, I thought...

19:24.780 --> 19:28.398
Yeah... Uh...

19:30.429 --> 19:33.931
Mm. Well, I guess I'm a
little old-fashioned that way.

19:33.956 --> 19:35.998
My mother stayed home and raised us

19:36.023 --> 19:37.510
when my sister and I were born.

19:37.535 --> 19:40.430
Well, I personally think that a mother
should have a life outside of the house.

19:40.455 --> 19:43.390
Too much focus on the kids
is just as bad as not enough.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.350
Do you, uh... do you agree, lovely?

19:45.375 --> 19:49.029
I think that it's a decision my
husband and I will make together

19:49.055 --> 19:51.455
when it comes time to cross that bridge.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.797
Very sensible... On a very dull topic.

19:54.822 --> 19:56.638
Shall we, uh... shall we move on?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.664
Agreed! Let's get this party started!

19:59.689 --> 20:00.482
Shall we?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.980
Maya, what are you doing?

20:05.229 --> 20:06.214
Oh, my gosh.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.718
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

20:07.743 --> 20:09.630
Let's get this party started indeed!

20:09.655 --> 20:11.255
Come on!

20:12.553 --> 20:14.431
Rachel, please talk to me.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.158
Your roommate called,

20:16.183 --> 20:17.712
said you're three months behind in rent.

20:17.737 --> 20:19.036
Bethany called?

20:20.471 --> 20:22.071
What do you need?

20:22.096 --> 20:24.311
Um... $20,000?

20:24.336 --> 20:26.192
Yeah, I have had some legal issues.

20:26.217 --> 20:27.646
I mean, it was just a...

20:27.671 --> 20:29.661
it was just a misunderstanding, but, um...

20:29.947 --> 20:31.046
A loan?

20:31.071 --> 20:32.694
- You know, just a loan.
- Mm-hmm.

20:32.719 --> 20:33.886
That would be really great.

20:33.911 --> 20:35.377
That would help me, um...

20:36.453 --> 20:40.264
You know, relieve a lot
of pressure... At work.

20:41.927 --> 20:43.627
I could be a better me.

20:43.652 --> 20:46.339
Rachel, you know your
father and I can help you...

20:46.364 --> 20:48.030
Mm-hmm.

20:48.274 --> 20:51.675
But not if you aren't
willing to help yourself.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.601
You and I need to resume our sessions.

20:54.626 --> 20:57.907
Well, I already have a therapist.

20:57.932 --> 21:00.199
Yep. And bonus... she's not my mother.

21:00.224 --> 21:01.578
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:01.603 --> 21:03.846
She works on the show, so...

21:03.871 --> 21:05.630
Oh.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.631
She's probably not even an M.D.

21:07.656 --> 21:09.544
I'm doing fine, and she's helping me out.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.105
Really? Because you don't look fine.

21:11.130 --> 21:13.716
- You're very thin, you're drinking too much...
- I'm doing a lot better.

21:13.741 --> 21:15.812
- And obviously not taking...
- And, this, what you're doing right now...

21:15.836 --> 21:17.567
this isn't ethical, okay?

21:17.592 --> 21:18.989
You treating me... it's not ethical.

21:19.014 --> 21:21.565
Those rules are arbitrary, okay?

21:22.526 --> 21:25.627
Are you taking your meds? Which ones?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.180
What am I prescribed for right now,

21:27.205 --> 21:30.294
because, uh, when we
started out it was ADHD,

21:30.319 --> 21:32.486
then we moved on to bipolar.

21:32.511 --> 21:34.739
And what came next... was it borderline

21:34.764 --> 21:36.302
or narcissistic personality disorder?

21:36.327 --> 21:38.214
Because I always have a
hard time with those two.

21:38.239 --> 21:40.977
I'm like constantly getting them confused.

21:41.002 --> 21:43.616
Well, it was very hard to pin down.

21:43.641 --> 21:45.941
You are a very tricky girl.

21:48.034 --> 21:50.731
- Can you feel the bubbles?
- Oh, yeah.

21:52.154 --> 21:54.421
Sommelier. Oops. Excuse me.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.124
Sommelier, what's your, uh...

21:56.149 --> 21:57.255
what's your name again, doll?

21:57.280 --> 21:58.579
Maya.

21:58.604 --> 22:00.704
Maya, well, I'm-a yours-a, Maya!

22:00.729 --> 22:02.359
Oh!

22:02.385 --> 22:04.055
You're naughty!

22:04.080 --> 22:05.179
Mate...

22:05.204 --> 22:06.786
Hey, you're making a fool of yourself.

22:06.811 --> 22:08.036
- I am?
- Yeah.

22:08.061 --> 22:10.649
I'm not the one who signed up
to a whorehouse on the telly.

22:13.510 --> 22:15.234
That's very sweet.

22:15.259 --> 22:16.906
Okay.

22:17.149 --> 22:20.851
Considering all your recent troubles,

22:20.876 --> 22:22.905
I think you should move
back home for a while.

22:22.930 --> 22:24.996
Um, our work would progress much faster

22:25.021 --> 22:26.546
if you weren't under so much stress.

22:26.571 --> 22:27.985
- Inpatient, huh?
- Yes.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.396
Yeah, just like you're doing with dad?

22:29.421 --> 22:31.090
'Cause what do you have him on?

22:31.115 --> 22:33.394
The guy is kind of seeming like a zombie.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.330
Oh, that is so not fair.

22:35.355 --> 22:39.057
Your father feels wonderful
since he started Ceronix.

22:39.082 --> 22:43.170
Rachel, these disorders run in families.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.826
What I have learned
from treating your father

22:45.851 --> 22:47.498
could really help you now.

22:51.151 --> 22:54.219
Rachel, I know you.

22:54.244 --> 22:56.557
I see what you're trying to hide

22:56.582 --> 22:59.115
and how exhausted it makes you.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.874
And it breaks my heart.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.730
There's no shame in it.

23:02.755 --> 23:05.661
You have a disease, period.

23:05.686 --> 23:09.239
- BPD is a chemical imbalance. This is not your fault.
- Okay, well, Dr. Wagerstein says...

23:09.264 --> 23:11.271
- that I don't present BPD...
- Oh, Dr. Wagerstein.

23:11.296 --> 23:12.958
Or any of the other things
that you say that I have.

23:12.983 --> 23:14.911
She says that there's nothing
wrong with me. That there's...

23:14.936 --> 23:17.857
Really? And I suppose that she is
more qualified than your own mother.

23:17.882 --> 23:20.649
I am just asking for some money.

23:21.725 --> 23:23.158
And you can have it.

23:25.108 --> 23:27.919
- But we have to resume our sessions.
- No, I can't, okay? I can't do it.

23:27.944 --> 23:31.411
- I am willing to do them over the phone...
- I can't be your project anymore.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.200
- If you cannot absolutely...
- And I know you don't approve,

23:33.225 --> 23:35.207
but I am damn good at what I do!

23:35.232 --> 23:38.633
And the reason you are
so good at what you do...

23:38.658 --> 23:41.153
the manipulation, the attunement...

23:41.178 --> 23:42.941
that is the disease.

23:42.966 --> 23:44.432
Oh, God, Rachel. Look at me.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.758
Please, please, please look at me.

23:47.184 --> 23:49.843
Are you happy the way you feel right now?

23:51.466 --> 23:52.731
Oh, baby.

23:52.756 --> 23:54.072
Come here.

23:54.097 --> 23:55.863
Shh.

23:55.888 --> 23:58.722
Okay.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.614
Shh.

24:00.826 --> 24:04.507
You have to admit that you're sick

24:04.532 --> 24:07.199
before you can get better.

24:25.022 --> 24:26.522
Screw you.

24:26.547 --> 24:28.413
Screw you.

24:28.438 --> 24:31.472
Screw you. Screw you.

24:31.497 --> 24:35.180
Screw you.

24:43.550 --> 24:47.099
I'm sorry about before,
about... All of this.

24:47.124 --> 24:50.075
Look... If you want to quit,

24:50.100 --> 24:53.207
- if you want to get out of here, I support you.
- No, Lizzie.

24:53.232 --> 24:54.865
No, I mean it.

24:55.508 --> 24:59.676
Move to New York, work
for Scorsese or somebody.

25:02.032 --> 25:04.633
You just have to move there with me...

25:05.206 --> 25:06.572
Not her.

25:06.597 --> 25:09.264
You'd do that? Are you serious?

25:09.970 --> 25:12.748
1,000%. Yeah.

25:12.773 --> 25:15.040
Come here.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.431
- Anyone else need a top-off?
- I'll take some.

25:22.456 --> 25:23.957
I meant your top off.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.582
- Oh! Adam, save me.
- Whoo!

25:26.607 --> 25:28.562
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

25:28.587 --> 25:32.356
Whoa, now, this is my idea of a party!

25:46.294 --> 25:49.430
Rog, rog. Remember, you're on TV.

25:49.455 --> 25:51.380
Yeah, American TV. Who watches that?

25:55.177 --> 25:57.068
Was this your idea?

25:57.093 --> 25:58.668
I just planted the seed.

26:00.051 --> 26:03.958
Maya! Maya!

26:03.984 --> 26:06.016
Maya! Maya!

26:06.041 --> 26:09.040
Maya! Maya! Maya!

26:09.065 --> 26:12.722
Maya! Maya! Maya!

26:12.747 --> 26:16.416
Whoo! Whoo!

26:16.441 --> 26:20.432
So, my friend Adam always
thinks that I go to far.

26:20.457 --> 26:23.304
So, tell me... Is this too far?

26:36.663 --> 26:38.920
It's called mitral valve prolapse,

26:38.945 --> 26:41.064
and while it's not a serious condition,

26:41.089 --> 26:43.790
the symptoms can mimic a heart attack.

26:43.815 --> 26:45.248
Probably triggered by the cocaine...

26:45.273 --> 26:47.006
Oh, my God.

26:47.031 --> 26:48.737
I told you.

26:48.762 --> 26:51.537
Which we found a lot of in your blood.

26:52.019 --> 26:54.656
And you are not a young man anymore.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.013
Now, here's the good news.

26:57.358 --> 26:59.172
Talk.

26:59.197 --> 27:00.997
What?!

27:01.735 --> 27:05.236
Unbelievable. Okay, I will be there soon.

27:05.261 --> 27:08.076
Just keep a lid on it until I get back.

27:08.952 --> 27:10.276
Oh, hey.

27:10.301 --> 27:11.764
Huh. Listen, I'm...

27:11.789 --> 27:13.646
I'm really sorry about everything.

27:13.671 --> 27:17.439
Oh, I'm fine. How are you holding up?

27:18.209 --> 27:19.909
Okay.

27:19.934 --> 27:22.334
Uh, why?  What do you mean?

27:22.359 --> 27:26.595
Well, I mean Chet's not
easy, but... He needs you.

27:28.445 --> 27:31.921
Look, I've got the house,
the cars, the vacations.

27:31.946 --> 27:34.313
Chet has you.

27:36.609 --> 27:39.944
But if you kill him
with all this partying...

27:40.759 --> 27:43.206
I get $40 million in life insurance.

27:43.231 --> 27:45.206
What do you have?

27:47.161 --> 27:49.870
Actually, I wanted to thank
you for sleeping with him.

27:49.895 --> 27:53.001
It is just one more thing off my to-do list,

27:53.026 --> 27:56.768
and it keeps him from
wandering too far, so...

27:57.105 --> 28:00.881
Thanks, Quinn. You're a real class act.

28:07.197 --> 28:10.089
Make sure that all the girls in
the hot tub keep their drinks filled

28:10.114 --> 28:12.513
and have drinks in
their hands at all times.

28:12.538 --> 28:14.552
- I don't want to hear anything about them...
- Hey.

28:14.577 --> 28:17.385
- All right? Go.
- Hey, what's going on?

28:17.410 --> 28:19.726
Oh, it's just Roger and Adam partying
with some of the girls. It's fine.

28:19.751 --> 28:21.391
Get them out of there now.

28:21.415 --> 28:24.591
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you not hear me? Now.

28:24.616 --> 28:25.827
I'm getting great footage.

28:25.852 --> 28:27.457
Oh, what with this music blasting?

28:27.482 --> 28:29.985
Because we can't use it. We can't
edit around it, so shut it down.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.865
Or what? You're gonna tell Quinn?

28:31.891 --> 28:33.691
'Cause I think she'd be interested to hear

28:33.716 --> 28:36.337
that you drove off in a show
van with a suspended license.

28:37.013 --> 28:41.497
You really do not want
to mess with me right now.

28:41.522 --> 28:44.047
Shake it. Shake it.

28:44.072 --> 28:45.538
Whoo!

28:48.078 --> 28:50.249
- Hey...
- Who did that?

28:50.274 --> 28:52.107
What happened to the music?!

28:52.132 --> 28:53.303
More champagne!

28:53.329 --> 28:54.314
Oh.

28:54.339 --> 28:55.795
- What the hell is this?
- It's Rachel.

28:55.820 --> 28:56.852
Uh-oh.

28:56.877 --> 28:57.876
Huh, what is this?

28:57.901 --> 29:00.132
Uh, it's a party for Roger.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.556
Uh-huh. Who happens to be where?

29:01.581 --> 29:02.998
Uh, he's...

29:05.214 --> 29:06.446
Who's in there?

29:06.471 --> 29:07.864
We're all here except for Maya.

29:07.889 --> 29:09.556
They got her pretty plastered.

29:10.121 --> 29:12.793
Maya!

29:15.019 --> 29:17.236
It's Rachel.

29:19.688 --> 29:22.038
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah.

29:22.063 --> 29:23.729
Come here. Just come here.

29:23.754 --> 29:25.562
I'm good. I'm good.

29:26.919 --> 29:29.090
I'm okay. Okay.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.614
Yeah.

29:33.082 --> 29:34.666
Sweetie, let me help you.

29:34.691 --> 29:37.413
All right? You've had too much to drink.

29:37.438 --> 29:39.760
- What the hell was that?
- What do you think it was, mate?

29:39.785 --> 29:41.194
Turn it off, mate.

29:41.219 --> 29:44.382
Away from the cameras.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.671
It's not about the
cameras. Why is she upset?

29:46.696 --> 29:48.135
I'm just trying to have a good time.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.159
A good time? What the hell is that?

29:55.918 --> 29:58.686
There he is. Ready for round 2?

29:58.711 --> 30:00.208
Oh, come on.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.144
You're not still mad. She wanted it, mate.

30:02.169 --> 30:03.783
Maya was too drunk to walk.

30:03.808 --> 30:05.708
I don't need them on their feet, do I?

30:05.733 --> 30:07.900
Oh, you're disgusting.

30:07.925 --> 30:09.955
You made an ass out of me today.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.653
This show is my ticket.

30:11.678 --> 30:13.924
To what? 15 minutes of infamy?

30:13.949 --> 30:15.640
- Haven't you already had that?
- Exactly.

30:15.665 --> 30:17.213
That's what I'm trying to repair,

30:17.238 --> 30:18.468
get my business back on track.

30:18.493 --> 30:20.526
There's only one way back, and you know it.

30:21.975 --> 30:24.160
Poppy still loves you, you know.

30:25.854 --> 30:28.289
Poppy was gone as soon as the money was.

30:28.314 --> 30:29.310
We were engaged.

30:29.335 --> 30:31.178
And not her fault you got
caught with prosties, though.

30:31.203 --> 30:32.636
She kind of had to save face.

30:32.738 --> 30:35.939
She never returned any of my calls.

30:36.449 --> 30:37.925
Did she say something to you?

30:37.950 --> 30:39.950
Yeah, she's cooled off. She misses you.

30:39.975 --> 30:42.370
Just come back home, do the apology tour.

30:42.395 --> 30:43.793
You two belong together.

30:43.818 --> 30:46.305
Your father won't stay angry.
It'll take a little groveling...

30:46.330 --> 30:48.468
my father, who ripped me in the press,

30:48.493 --> 30:50.364
stopped my mother and
brothers from talking to me?

30:50.389 --> 30:51.232
I don't think so.

30:51.257 --> 30:53.152
All he wants is a respectable son,

30:53.177 --> 30:55.811
and this circus makes
the whole family look bad.

30:58.864 --> 31:02.104
Oh, God. Did he send you?

31:02.758 --> 31:04.872
- So what if he did?
- Oh, my God.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.496
That's proof right there
he's willing to forgive.

31:06.521 --> 31:09.114
No. I have had enough of him

31:09.139 --> 31:11.506
controlling me with his checkbook.

31:11.531 --> 31:12.941
I have to be my own man.

31:13.890 --> 31:15.485
Don't you understand?

31:15.510 --> 31:18.437
We're trying to save you
from being your own man.

31:18.516 --> 31:20.519
All you do is fail at it.

31:26.239 --> 31:27.939
I'm busy.

31:27.964 --> 31:30.498
I want Carl's job. I
want you to get it for me.

31:30.523 --> 31:32.090
What? You've got Quinn's ear.

31:32.115 --> 31:33.450
You should have talked
to her a long time ago.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.881
And commit you to this? No.

31:34.906 --> 31:36.172
- Rach.
- Hmm?

31:36.197 --> 31:39.409
Getting out was your dream. It's not mine.

31:47.487 --> 31:50.368
Maya? Hey.

31:54.415 --> 31:56.596
You don't have to do this, okay?

31:56.621 --> 31:58.732
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

31:59.276 --> 32:01.589
Why don't you just tell me what happened?

32:01.614 --> 32:02.814
Nothing happened.

32:02.839 --> 32:04.570
Just drank a little too much. That's it.

32:04.595 --> 32:06.682
You don't feel like he
forced himself on you?

32:06.707 --> 32:07.601
No, I don't feel like... God.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.023
Why make an even bigger deal
out of this than it already is?

32:18.344 --> 32:21.272
You think I have any chance of staying?

32:21.297 --> 32:22.623
Of course.

32:22.648 --> 32:24.616
Look, Adam's not going to hold
that Roger stuff against you.

32:24.641 --> 32:26.341
Go.

32:27.972 --> 32:29.920
What happened to you?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.871
Seems my good friend Roger isn't so good.

32:32.896 --> 32:34.629
- Or a friend.
- Yeah, no kidding.

32:34.654 --> 32:37.750
I'm sorry, truly. That was...

32:38.240 --> 32:39.673
Yeah.

32:43.685 --> 32:45.756
Can we get touches for Adam, please?

32:45.781 --> 32:46.899
- Okay, people, let's do this.
- Copy.

32:46.924 --> 32:48.506
Can we get some final
touches on Adam, please?

32:48.531 --> 32:49.993
Adam, how you doing? You
warm enough? You okay?

32:50.018 --> 32:52.433
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay, quickly, quickly.

32:52.458 --> 32:55.313
Touches quickly, quickly.
Thank you so much.

32:57.328 --> 32:59.897
Everyone settle.

33:00.804 --> 33:01.970
Action.

33:01.995 --> 33:05.102
Ladies, it is now time for Roger

33:05.127 --> 33:07.781
to pick Adam's companion
for the day-long date.

33:07.806 --> 33:09.373
Have you chosen well, Roger?

33:09.398 --> 33:11.365
Oh, indeed I have, Graham.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.790
Adam.

33:27.126 --> 33:28.826
Maya.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.650
Now it is time for the elimination round.

33:43.675 --> 33:45.556
Ladies, for five of you,

33:45.581 --> 33:48.164
this magical fairy tale ends tonight.

34:01.816 --> 34:04.875
This is my life. This sucks.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.696
- What a mess.
- Yeah.

34:19.989 --> 34:21.243
Well...

34:22.292 --> 34:24.422
This footage is useless.

34:24.784 --> 34:28.351
Most of it is inane or
covered in music, and...

34:28.818 --> 34:30.152
The other half of it

34:30.177 --> 34:33.152
makes Adam look like a
romance-hating man-whore,

34:33.177 --> 34:34.224
which he might be,

34:34.248 --> 34:35.868
but it's really bad for the damn show.

34:35.893 --> 34:37.559
Hey. Look at me.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.261
Do you remember

34:40.286 --> 34:44.309
what you said to me when you came back?

34:44.333 --> 34:47.802
"I can do this, Quinn."

34:47.827 --> 34:49.413
And I believed you.

34:50.801 --> 34:52.309
Why are you angry at me?

34:52.333 --> 34:53.889
You're the one that put Shia in charge.

34:53.915 --> 34:55.348
Because.

34:55.373 --> 34:57.139
Look at you.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.965
I need you on the ball.

34:59.990 --> 35:02.004
And you can't even wash your own hair.

35:02.029 --> 35:03.953
That's not fair.

35:04.775 --> 35:08.224
But I guess it's my fault.

35:08.249 --> 35:10.050
I should have learned.

35:10.075 --> 35:11.248
Okay, I can...

35:11.273 --> 35:13.801
I can get it under control.
I can take care of it.

35:15.047 --> 35:18.081
Okay, then, do it.

35:18.106 --> 35:20.611
'Cause I need an episode.

35:21.279 --> 35:24.625
Get me something I can use.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.099
Dr. Wagerstein, hi.

35:42.124 --> 35:43.404
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you okay?

35:43.429 --> 35:44.937
It's kind of late. You're still here.

35:44.962 --> 35:46.546
Oh, uh, I was looking for you, actually.

35:46.571 --> 35:48.147
I-I've been watching footage.

35:48.172 --> 35:50.361
Anna's vomiting's getting worse.

35:50.386 --> 35:52.854
Oh, okay, yeah, um...

35:53.045 --> 35:55.091
I'll take a look at it.
I'll get into it. Thanks.

35:55.116 --> 35:56.983
- Thanks for the head's up.
- O-okay.

36:09.953 --> 36:12.126
Hey, Anna, how's it going?

36:12.151 --> 36:13.725
Hey. Good.

36:13.750 --> 36:15.078
- Yeah.
- Yeah. How are you?

36:15.103 --> 36:15.993
I'm okay.

36:16.018 --> 36:17.684
Um, look...

36:17.709 --> 36:20.877
Grace is saying that she's a
little bit worried about you.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.140
Grace? Why?

36:24.165 --> 36:26.899
Well, she's saying that she
doesn't really see you eat.

36:26.924 --> 36:29.825
You know, and that your weight's
been yo-yoing a little bit

36:29.850 --> 36:33.786
and, uh... Frankly, we've noticed, too.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.624
What?

36:41.414 --> 36:43.540
You have to admit that you're sick

36:43.565 --> 36:45.532
before you can get better.

36:48.302 --> 36:51.404
My dad just died.

36:53.737 --> 36:57.516
So, what do need to get this under control?

36:57.922 --> 37:00.055
Honestly?

37:00.080 --> 37:01.141
Uh-huh.

37:01.166 --> 37:04.563
'Cause it's gonna sound
completely mentally ill.

37:04.588 --> 37:06.684
Try me. I've heard...

37:06.709 --> 37:09.410
hell, I've said almost everything.

37:11.894 --> 37:13.961
Oh.

37:13.986 --> 37:16.364
- Cheesy puffs.
- Cheesy puffs.

37:16.389 --> 37:18.827
Or just anything that's bright orange.

37:18.852 --> 37:20.485
Okay, I can do that for you.

37:20.510 --> 37:22.985
- Thank you.
- Mm.

37:23.689 --> 37:25.623
God, I'm sorry.

37:25.648 --> 37:27.414
Hey.

37:27.439 --> 37:30.917
You don't have anything
to say you're sorry about.

37:32.300 --> 37:35.229
But you do need to talk to grace.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.153
Why?

37:37.178 --> 37:38.972
Well, because she's turning Adam off

37:38.997 --> 37:41.764
with that shit she's
talking, and it kills me.

37:41.789 --> 37:44.748
You know, you have a legit disease, Anna.

37:44.773 --> 37:47.684
That girl has never worked at
being thin a day in her life.

37:47.710 --> 37:50.478
No kidding.

37:50.809 --> 37:52.442
So, listen...

37:53.084 --> 37:56.196
All that anger that you
point towards yourself...

37:57.728 --> 38:01.733
Point it at the bitch who
is ruining your future.

38:02.383 --> 38:04.661
So, what, Maya does Roger,

38:04.686 --> 38:06.620
so she gets the date with Adam?

38:06.699 --> 38:08.498
That's just... Blah.

38:08.523 --> 38:11.118
She's gonna fit right
in at Buckingham Palace.

38:11.143 --> 38:14.044
Believe me.

38:21.464 --> 38:23.064
We should talk.

38:24.491 --> 38:26.324
Sounds about right.

38:34.213 --> 38:36.754
I'll meet you in the car in a few.

38:36.779 --> 38:38.646
Just let me wrap up.

38:38.671 --> 38:41.271
Sounds good.

38:46.989 --> 38:50.347
You did? Oh, my God, I love you.

38:50.373 --> 38:52.148
I'm dying right now.

38:52.173 --> 38:54.604
I'd do anything for a sleeping pill.

38:54.629 --> 38:56.132
Hi, Grace.

38:56.157 --> 38:57.044
Hi, honey.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.605
- Don't "honey" me.
- What?

38:59.630 --> 39:01.296
You said that I'm fat?

39:01.321 --> 39:02.878
No. What?

39:02.903 --> 39:04.169
What do you even know about it?

39:04.194 --> 39:05.927
What's that supposed to mean?

39:05.952 --> 39:08.019
It means that you can
eat whatever you want.

39:08.044 --> 39:09.977
You have your... your
Greek omelet for breakfast,

39:10.002 --> 39:11.068
your cheeseburger for lunch...

39:11.093 --> 39:13.404
you don't even exercise,
so you're barfing, too?

39:13.429 --> 39:15.902
Or you just have some freak metabolism?

39:15.927 --> 39:17.782
"Barfing, too"?

39:17.807 --> 39:19.966
No. I would never.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.058
And how do you know what I eat, anyway?

39:22.264 --> 39:24.718
I-I just do. I can't... I can't help that.

39:24.743 --> 39:25.876
Well, it's creepy.

39:25.901 --> 39:27.559
Mind your own business, barfer.

39:27.584 --> 39:30.485
I can't, grace. I am sick, okay?

39:30.510 --> 39:32.246
And you shouldn't go running your mouth

39:32.271 --> 39:33.813
about things you couldn't
possibly understand.

39:33.838 --> 39:37.072
Oh, right, because I'm a model,
my life is perfect and easy.

39:37.097 --> 39:38.495
Yeah, pretty much.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.086
Ladies, I'm sure we can work this out.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.454
You guys... I can't with
control freaks like her

39:42.479 --> 39:44.316
pushing poor, dumb models around.

39:44.341 --> 39:46.036
The thing is, Grace,

39:46.061 --> 39:47.685
I don't actually think that you're dumb,

39:47.710 --> 39:49.410
but I guess you do.

39:49.435 --> 39:50.938
I mean, that's... that's probably why

39:50.963 --> 39:52.826
- You sucked your way to get where you are.
- Oh, boy.

39:53.088 --> 39:55.380
- What did you just say to me?
- Yeah.

39:55.405 --> 39:56.741
Oh, yeah, everyone, um,

39:56.767 --> 39:58.950
Grace here, she's been sucking Adam's...

39:58.975 --> 40:01.338
Don't you dare

40:01.371 --> 40:03.341
- talk about me like that in front of everyone,
- What is wrong with you?

40:03.366 --> 40:05.185
- You stupid bitch.
- You don't slap me. My God.

40:05.210 --> 40:07.169
- You don't hit me!
- You keep my name out of your mouth!

40:07.194 --> 40:09.594
- You don't know anything about why...
- You stupid, dumb, whiny bitch!

40:09.681 --> 40:11.314
Say my name again!

40:14.710 --> 40:18.504
Um, Quinn just asked me to
tell you she can't make it.

40:18.530 --> 40:20.842
She ended up getting
dragged into something.

40:20.867 --> 40:23.234
She said you should just head home.

40:35.938 --> 40:38.993
See? I knew you could do it.

40:41.628 --> 40:45.578
So, I heard that you went home.

40:45.603 --> 40:47.236
Yeah.

40:47.261 --> 40:50.401
- Hmm.
- My mom thinks I'm seriously ill.

40:52.094 --> 40:54.368
Mental.

40:54.393 --> 40:57.356
There is nothing wrong with you.

40:57.381 --> 40:59.381
You're a genius.

41:02.699 --> 41:05.566
I'm never getting out of here.

41:06.202 --> 41:09.103
Why would you want to?

41:09.128 --> 41:11.193
You're home.

41:19.791 --> 41:22.491
That's good TV.
