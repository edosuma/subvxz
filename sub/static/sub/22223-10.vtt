WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.955
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.045 --> 00:06.583
A relationship is based
on trust.

00:06.674 --> 00:10.337
I didn't want to tell you about
the pregnancy until I was sure.

00:10.428 --> 00:14.546
Sure you were pregnant,
or sure who the father was?

00:14.640 --> 00:18.553
In view of the continuing danger
we face in Peacekeeper space,

00:18.644 --> 00:24.435
I'm reluctantly forced to
considertraveling into
Tormented Space.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.813
Can't be as bad as some of the
places we've been lately.

00:27.904 --> 00:29.235
It can.

00:29.322 --> 00:30.107
Chiana:
What's he doin' here?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.278
He wants asylum.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.480
Asylum?

00:32.575 --> 00:35.317
I gave my word that he
would not be harmed.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.821
Why did you come here?

00:36.913 --> 00:40.405
To safeguard John Crichton,

00:40.499 --> 00:42.205
amongst other things.

00:42.293 --> 00:45.035
D'Argo:
Can you trust Scorpius?

00:45.129 --> 00:47.245
More today than yesterday. Why?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.630
And now, on Farscape.

01:03.439 --> 01:04.303
Highly abnormal.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.231
Ugh! Even I can't eat that much.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.025
Is that really your
third helping?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.940
Fifth.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.146
Highly abnormal.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.947
Highly effective.

01:15.034 --> 01:18.902
Aeryn:
So, the advantages of only
eating ten times a cycle are...

01:18.996 --> 01:20.611
Sikozu:
Not eating all the other times.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.957
Pilot:
Captain?

01:22.041 --> 01:23.247
Pilot.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.825
Moya has asked me to
once again convey...

01:25.920 --> 01:27.501
Okay, stop right there.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.830
We're aware that you think this
planet is a pit, an outpost
of nothing.

01:30.925 --> 01:35.464
Rygel:
Their food's overcooked
undercooked, and not worth cooking.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.512
Makes Noranti's food
seem edible.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.135
Pilot, how bad is it?

01:40.226 --> 01:44.094
Without additional
zyntian filtration, the
electrostatic impulses

01:44.188 --> 01:47.271
from surrounding radiation
sources will drive her mad.

01:47.358 --> 01:51.943
Moya has not had peaceful
rest since we entered the
Tormented Space.

01:52.029 --> 01:56.363
D'Argo:
This is the only planet we've
found whose mechanics are aware of Leviathans.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.315
They can get the job done.

01:59.245 --> 02:01.156
But when, Captain?

02:01.247 --> 02:05.206
Sikozu:
When their doctor certifies that
none of us has Space Madness.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.701
(audible forced breath)

02:13.092 --> 02:16.175
After you.

02:16.262 --> 02:23.009
He has already certified free
of, uh, transmissible
celestial dementia?

02:23.102 --> 02:24.512
We're calling it Space Madness.

02:24.603 --> 02:30.724
Scarran ancestry, however,
disqualifies visitation
to Khurtanan.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.228
( growling softly)

02:32.653 --> 02:34.268
Hit the road.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.648
Space invader.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.194
Stillness.

02:43.289 --> 02:47.123
I'm sure that Pilot told you
that Moya's hull protects us
from radiation.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.995
Good.

02:49.086 --> 02:56.834
Space Madness is so feared on
this planet that there
are no exceptions.

02:56.927 --> 03:01.216
Now for the neurologic
brain scan.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.423
(whirring )

03:11.734 --> 03:13.099
Hmm...

03:15.196 --> 03:16.857
Hey look, I know you guys
lie and all,

03:16.947 --> 03:19.154
but this is not gonna hurt
too bad, is it?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.277
Not a bit.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.530
(yelling)

03:27.750 --> 03:29.206
No, no, no. No.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.033
This food is dren.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.119
l'll agree to that.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.421
Ah. If you'd have held your
scream out for one more microt,

03:35.508 --> 03:37.123
I would have won the pool.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.833
Oh, too bad. Anything edible?

03:40.221 --> 03:41.381
Remarkable.

03:41.472 --> 03:44.088
So, Doc Snot commed ahead
giving us the all-clear

03:44.183 --> 03:47.175
and Pilot says that the
mechanic is on approach.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.057
Wow, that's crap.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.183
( sneezing )

03:52.274 --> 03:53.810
D'Argo:
Know what?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.267
I think I might be allergic
to something here.

03:56.362 --> 04:00.856
Gratification at meeting
you all.

04:00.950 --> 04:03.157
Did you enjoy the repast?

04:03.244 --> 04:06.156
Well, it's the first thing I've
had in a while that doesn't
taste like chicken.

04:06.247 --> 04:09.159
Kind of reminds me of a big
bowl of Alpo I once ate.

04:09.250 --> 04:14.745
Ha, perhaps when you visit the
planet you'll discover better
nourishment.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.205
D'Argo:
Uh, we won't be visiting
the planet, Doctor.

04:17.299 --> 04:20.336
As soon as your mechanic fixes
our ship, we'll be leaving.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.338
( sneezing )

04:21.429 --> 04:22.919
( sneezing )

04:23.013 --> 04:23.923
(chuckling)

04:24.014 --> 04:26.972
I risk to differ, Captain.

04:27.059 --> 04:33.271
Oh, did I forget to mention not
to share the Qatal Mollusks?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.018
They're to be eaten whole.

04:35.109 --> 04:39.102
Should the flesh be divided
among different stomachs,

04:39.196 --> 04:40.527
(chuckling)

04:40.614 --> 04:44.948
the food poisoning that
results is fatal.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.368
What did you do?

04:52.460 --> 04:57.079
Initiated the first half of our
business arrangement.

04:57.173 --> 05:05.137
Bring one quarter million
currency pledges each
to my office,

05:05.222 --> 05:08.259
and I will cure you.

05:14.899 --> 05:18.767
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:18.861 --> 05:22.399
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.276
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:24.366 --> 05:27.574
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.401
my friends.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.284
I've made enemies.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.616
Powerful, dangerous.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.203
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:39.298 --> 05:42.290
to warn Earth.

05:42.384 --> 05:47.219
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.453
Know what? Why don't we
just shoot you?

06:21.507 --> 06:24.089
It does sound presumptuous,
I know,

06:24.176 --> 06:29.170
but I am the only one
that can cure you.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.717
The weapons will only cause the
mechanic to resist the
modifications

06:34.812 --> 06:36.894
your ship requires.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.064
Suppose we tell him
what you did.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.277
Well, he will not believe you.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.147
He cannot help you.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.446
And I will double my price.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.740
Care to call my bluff?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.249
Hmm?

07:08.387 --> 07:10.878
Do not delay payment.

07:10.973 --> 07:16.809
Your symptoms will greatly mimic
the uncontrolled disorders

07:16.895 --> 07:19.637
associated with space madness,

07:19.732 --> 07:23.520
a disease they shoot
on sight for.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.616
Doctor.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.992
As I communicated, clean
health for all.

07:37.082 --> 07:40.370
No threat of affective illness.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.502
At the moment.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.000
( sneezing )

07:46.091 --> 07:48.924
(farting)

07:49.011 --> 07:50.672
(groaning)

07:50.763 --> 07:52.674
(chuckling)

07:54.933 --> 07:56.264
(laughing)

07:56.352 --> 07:57.762
Hey.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.934
Glad to see ya.

08:00.022 --> 08:00.727
(groaning)

08:00.814 --> 08:01.678
( sneezing )

08:01.774 --> 08:03.765
(groaning)

08:03.859 --> 08:05.144
As you can see, we're...

08:05.235 --> 08:06.645
we're all excited by it all.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.194
Rygel:
If you'll excuse me.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.192
(groaning and farting)

08:12.284 --> 08:13.899
D'Argo:
Chiana.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.235
Excuse me.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.866
Did you eat any of the mollusks?

08:17.956 --> 08:19.241
No.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.948
Good, okay.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.500
I want you to put this mechanic
to work but I want you
to stay with him.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.249
He goes nowhere without you.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.705
Okay.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.337
Where do you need to go?

08:30.427 --> 08:33.590
The zyntian filter must be
installed in a primary
sensory nerve conduit.

08:33.681 --> 08:38.550
Sikozu:
Any Neural Cluster will do,
once we have diverted the synaptic flow.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.724
And, um...

08:39.812 --> 08:41.643
I can tell Pilot how
to do that...

08:41.730 --> 08:43.061
(groaning)

08:44.441 --> 08:45.772
Right.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.474
Come on.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.605
Right, y'all have fun now.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.109
Watch out for those hooligan
trill bats.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.279
They're killers.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.356
Aeryn:
What the frell is going on here?

08:54.451 --> 08:57.534
Every time Rygel vents,
In.vent

09:00.207 --> 09:03.870
I'm digesting a large meal that
should not be affecting you.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.417
Well, it does.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.496
Is this a side effect of
the Day-Glo clams?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.455
It must be.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.634
D'Argo and I both ate the
purple mollusks, and every time
he sneezes I feel it.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.257
Rygel and I had the green one.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.723
Somehow it's linked us.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.718
( passing gas)

09:19.685 --> 09:21.971
We have to find a cure
very quickly.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.520
Okay. Let's go down to the
planet and have a chat
with our doctor.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.189
Analyze the food. If you find a
cure, comm us immediately.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.017
So we can chop his head off.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.275
I'll need various bodily
samples from each of you.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.239
( hawking )

09:37.411 --> 09:39.322
Thank you. Next.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.032
Are you sure?

09:41.123 --> 09:42.408
Absolutely.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.420
How long will this take?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.759
Couple of arns at the most.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.149
Why are you staring at me?

10:11.236 --> 10:13.648
Well, maybe I think
you're cute.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.323
Think whatever you want,
but I'm just here to do a job.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.071
I just wanna see that you
don't hurt Moya.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.033
Time to bypass the synapses.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.287
Pilot, we need to cutoff
power to this Cluster.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.833
Diverting now.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.957
No, it'd be more efficient
if you simply...

10:31.048 --> 10:34.290
I do not need your help.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.632
( powering down )

10:55.072 --> 10:57.358
Dr. Tumii will be back shortly.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.610
Well, we'd like to see him now.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.235
Nothing I can do.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.329
Damn, this place could
use some air-con.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.907
Where the hell is Sikozu?
In a sauna?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.117
Don't complain.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.249
You're not feeling three
overfull stomachs.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.422
Hmm...

11:20.806 --> 11:22.137
Ah.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.589
(hiccups)

11:23.684 --> 11:25.265
Okay. This is new.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.308
It's not me,
it's definitely her.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.391
(hiccups)

11:32.818 --> 11:35.400
That's all for today.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.353
Ah.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.358
(hiccuping)

11:52.921 --> 11:56.789
Killing me kills you.

11:56.884 --> 11:57.919
May I speak?

11:58.010 --> 12:00.217
No. Cure first, speak later.

12:00.304 --> 12:03.091
Oh, put those away.

12:03.181 --> 12:07.470
I promise you, I can't be
forced to cure you.

12:07.561 --> 12:12.476
And the cure is of my
own devising.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.227
You won't find it elsewhere.

12:14.318 --> 12:18.277
Let me explain the
Qatal Mollusk.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.228
Please don't. We give up.
We'll pay.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.905
(sniffling)

12:23.243 --> 12:29.364
Each mollusk harbors one colony
of neurally linked bacteria

12:29.458 --> 12:33.576
and each colony acts
as one organism.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.333
So much so, that if the
mollusk is halved,

12:37.424 --> 12:44.717
its bacteria alternately
transmit each half's sensations
to the other half.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.216
Why?

12:46.308 --> 12:48.048
Who cares?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.223
Take the money. Cure us.

12:49.311 --> 12:54.351
Now that the bacteria have
colonized your bodies,

12:54.441 --> 13:00.653
they're communicating your
emotional states to, uh,

13:00.739 --> 13:04.323
force you to merge.

13:04.409 --> 13:08.152
The problem is you
are not mollusks.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.157
That's never been a problem
for us before.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.749
It is now.

13:11.833 --> 13:16.418
Your bodies, unlike the mollusk
halves, can never merge.

13:16.505 --> 13:23.217
And so your symptoms worsen and
eventually the strain kills you.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.259
All right, we understand.
Fix it.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.962
We'll pay double if
you shut up.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.263
( chuckles )

13:28.350 --> 13:31.308
And I'll break your neck
if you don't.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.511
Cure us all. Now.

13:33.605 --> 13:34.640
|wi||.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.564
But I am down to my
last mollusk,

13:37.651 --> 13:43.271
and each cure requires the
same type as was ingested.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.229
So get more.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.862
More being delivered
in a few arns.

13:47.953 --> 13:54.825
Until then, I can only cure
whoever ate the purple mollusk.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.792
That'd be me.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.203
Both:
I hate you.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.836
(humming a song)

14:17.399 --> 14:20.106
Oh... oh...

14:21.361 --> 14:23.397
Oh, oh, oh...

14:23.488 --> 14:25.024
When this is finished,

14:25.115 --> 14:28.448
you'll mix it with the other
linked patient's urine

14:28.535 --> 14:31.402
and then you orally ingest.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.614
No way. I am not drinking
the old woman's urine.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.913
(gasping)

14:39.880 --> 14:41.165
( exhales )

14:41.256 --> 14:42.166
D, what's up?

14:42.257 --> 14:46.421
Nothing, it's, uh...
it's Noranti, she...

14:47.888 --> 14:48.673
Is she in pain?

14:48.764 --> 14:50.720
(gasping)

14:50.807 --> 14:52.513
It's... it's the opposite.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.137
Ah, oh...

14:54.227 --> 14:57.310
Tumii:
She's experiencing
intense pleasure?

14:57.397 --> 14:58.432
Oh!

14:58.523 --> 15:00.263
Very intense.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.849
Um, John... do you think
you could...

15:02.944 --> 15:05.686
Whoa, no, no, don't come near me
when you're feeling like that.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.863
( breathing heavily)

15:07.949 --> 15:09.905
Come on, D'Argo. Just fight it.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.777
D, think about baseball.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.363
Math. Isosceles triangle.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.290
Rusty razor blades. Gravel.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.537
(shrieking)

15:20.629 --> 15:21.539
Ah!

15:23.256 --> 15:24.086
Ah!

15:26.384 --> 15:27.009
Ah!

15:27.344 --> 15:28.379
Oh!

15:30.680 --> 15:32.420
(gasps )

15:39.648 --> 15:41.263
She lost it.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.147
( crashes )

15:46.238 --> 15:48.103
(shrieks)

15:48.198 --> 15:51.941
This will give more
lasting relief.

15:52.035 --> 15:57.280
Divide, urinate,
exchange, ingest.

15:57.374 --> 16:02.994
You and the linked one must then
press bare flesh to bare flesh,

16:03.088 --> 16:05.124
so the bacteria can migrate.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.421
How much bare flesh?

16:06.508 --> 16:08.840
Hands will suffice.

16:08.927 --> 16:15.014
You see, the cure unbinds the
bacteria from your cells and
tricks the colony into...

16:15.100 --> 16:20.891
Crichton:
One more word of technobabble
and I'm gonna cut your tongue out.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.097
D'Argo you wanna go
check it out?

16:27.195 --> 16:29.982
I'm afraid the boy may be
ruined for life.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.155
l'm almostjealous.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.948
And if this doesn't work,

16:34.035 --> 16:35.491
you're dead.

16:35.579 --> 16:39.197
With all respect, so are you.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.658
Mekken:
Bioscan's negative so far,

16:42.752 --> 16:45.835
but how can you travel in
something so alive?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.458
All the filthy bacteria.

16:47.549 --> 16:51.588
Moya is quite hygienic.
She is self disinfecting.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.293
She is female?

16:53.388 --> 16:54.377
Oh, yes.

16:54.472 --> 16:57.305
But only controlled by Pilot,
3 male, of course.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.509
Ah, okay.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.595
That's not so bad.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.681
And there never has been
a case of Space Madness
aboard this ship.

17:05.775 --> 17:10.314
Oh, you're lucky. We've had to
terminate three cases in the
last half cycle.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.611
An outbreak?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.110
I guess so.
I thought it had gone.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.863
Three cases out of the blue.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.661
They were good men, too.

17:19.748 --> 17:20.863
Real shame.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.413
Oh, indeed.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.876
All male?

17:23.960 --> 17:27.077
That's what makes it
a real shame.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.967
( buzzer sounds)
Ah, I believe the mollusks
have arrived.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.544
Arrived in less than 30 minutes.
-Finally.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.800
Don't forget to tip the driver.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.858
Son of a bitch.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.400
Vanished.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.734
Lie still, don't move.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.240
(grunting)

18:01.331 --> 18:04.198
Who is the doctor?

18:04.292 --> 18:07.250
Oh, plainly not you.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.206
(panting)

18:09.297 --> 18:11.162
Did you see who shot me?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.499
Not her face. She disappeared.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.711
But you're certain she
was female?
-Mm-hmm.

18:19.349 --> 18:23.342
We are all in serious
difficulty.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.642
"We"?

18:24.729 --> 18:29.689
Yes. I'm afraid I
can't cure you.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.585
Go on. Take it. Drink it.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.886
Why do you hesitate?

18:59.973 --> 19:01.258
Why do you think?

19:01.349 --> 19:03.761
Would you rather die
than drink it?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.267
(sighing ):
Okay.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.143
So we should be touching
while we drink this.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.647
Oh, so you said.
Um, bare skin to bare skin.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.649
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.196
Not that much bare skin.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.898
But I... I would have thought
that the more contact...

19:19.993 --> 19:22.075
No, the doctor would have said,
you know. (whistles )

19:22.162 --> 19:23.117
Oh, yes.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.660
Less skin.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.201
( exhales heavily)

19:30.920 --> 19:32.706
Here's to ya.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.166
(inhales sharply)

19:41.598 --> 19:42.587
Did it work?

19:42.682 --> 19:43.546
Dunno.

19:43.641 --> 19:44.721
Test it.

19:44.809 --> 19:45.343
Okay.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.220
(grunts)

19:46.311 --> 19:47.141
Oh!

19:47.228 --> 19:48.809
Was that absolutely necessary?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.138
Oh, one little pop.

19:51.232 --> 19:51.937
(gasps )

19:52.025 --> 19:53.356
(yeIpS)

19:53.443 --> 19:54.273
Oh!

19:54.361 --> 19:55.225
Oh, I just got a fright. I...

19:55.320 --> 19:56.150
(sighs)

19:56.237 --> 19:57.977
I didn't feel anything.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.188
It's working.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.823
John, the cure seems
to be working.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.402
That's great news, D.
I hate you even more.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.408
Tumii:
Certainly it's working.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.581
Just maintain contact.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.656
For how long?

20:10.752 --> 20:13.334
Until you feel an oily
sensaﬂon,

20:13.421 --> 20:17.835
which signifies the bacteria
have all precipitated out.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.166
No more than a few arns.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.636
Arns?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.632
What happens if they break
contact before... that?

20:23.723 --> 20:28.808
The bacteria will recolonize
in their bodies and
the symptoms recur

20:28.895 --> 20:30.886
and eventually, they'll die.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.265
It's not gonna happen.

20:32.357 --> 20:36.225
Aeryn:
Rygel, you and Sikozu get
down here quickly.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.436
Right. Oh!

20:39.531 --> 20:42.318
Do you know I've been looking
for this opportunity
for so long.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.865
I've wanted to get you alone.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.692
There are so many things
I don't know about you.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.369
You know, Doc, you might wanna
give her a reason not
to kill you.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.242
Oh...

20:50.333 --> 20:55.327
To cure you, I need Qatal
Mollusks, and I can no
longer get them.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.333
Why not? Credit problems?

20:57.424 --> 21:02.259
Let me explain the
sociopolitical situation
on Khurtanan.

21:02.345 --> 21:06.213
As you may know, females
are oppressed here.

21:06.307 --> 21:11.677
but there is a resistance
movement planning a violent
coup to seize power.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.307
Girl power. So what?

21:13.398 --> 21:17.641
They possess the only
Qatal Mollusks on this planet.

21:17.735 --> 21:22.604
(chuckling):
They employ them to eliminate
certain males in power.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.235
So why use the mollusks?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.610
Secrecy.

21:25.702 --> 21:29.661
The Qatal symptoms are not
known on this planet.

21:29.747 --> 21:33.160
They are mistaken for
Space Madness.

21:33.251 --> 21:36.243
Yeah, and anyone with Space
Madness is put down like
a rabid dog.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.668
We got that part.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.918
Correct. But during an autopsy
on one of the victims,

21:41.009 --> 21:43.671
I saw the real cause.

21:43.761 --> 21:47.845
I found out who was responsible
and I made a deal.

21:47.932 --> 21:52.221
My silence for some of
the mollusks.

21:52.312 --> 21:56.146
So you use them for extortion
and they use them for
coup by clam.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.733
We still don't care.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.604
Apart from the obvious, why did
theyjust try to kill you?

22:00.695 --> 22:06.736
I assume that their big takeover
attempt must be imminent.

22:06.826 --> 22:12.162
Possibly they're afraid
I might expose them.

22:12.248 --> 22:17.333
All I can do is refund
two-thirds of your currency.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.409
Oh, no.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.121
You're going to tell me where
the females are.

22:32.435 --> 22:36.269
Um... I thought you might need
some help with your equipment.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.972
I'm fine.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.603
Sure you are...

22:41.444 --> 22:43.150
(grunting)

22:44.364 --> 22:46.275
sister?

22:46.366 --> 22:48.698
You can't tell Mekken.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.738
He'll kill me.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.205
Oh? Well, maybe I'll kill you.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.244
( blow lands )

22:54.332 --> 22:56.664
(groaning in pain)

22:58.670 --> 23:00.376
What have I done to you?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.454
I told you, I'm just here
to do a job.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.538
Yeah?

23:03.633 --> 23:05.419
Well, then why the
sex change, hmm?

23:05.510 --> 23:06.966
I don't think you're
here to help us.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.338
I think you're here
to spy on us.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.215
To make sure we eat those
frelling mollusks!

23:10.306 --> 23:12.592
I don't know what you're
talking about.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.266
I'm here to help you.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.015
Fixing your Leviathan.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.599
Then what's with this?

23:22.694 --> 23:25.731
What's with the change?

23:25.822 --> 23:29.906
Because women on my world aren't
allowed to do this sort of work.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.529
Sure.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.659
(grunts)

23:33.746 --> 23:38.115
You don't believe me, I'll go.

23:38.209 --> 23:42.418
Get someone else. Some male to
stop your ship from going mad.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.585
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.380
Okay, maybe...
maybe you're not lying.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.424
No maybe.

24:07.196 --> 24:11.280
These female revolutionaries
run a club to entertain men?

24:11.367 --> 24:17.363
Very popular with rich and
powerful males, including
governing officials.

24:17.457 --> 24:23.043
Crichton:
Then one night, they chop some
mollusk up into the hors d'oeuvres and instant coup.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.120
I should probably go alone.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.750
No, no, no, I got it.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.297
Currency.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.999
Do we have the antidote?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.254
Just going for that.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.382
Oh well, hurry up.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.384
This place reeks of antiseptic.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.431
Sikozu, we have a mission.

24:37.518 --> 24:38.268
I'm happy to go.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.639
Jirl power.
-Hmm?

24:40.730 --> 24:43.938
Girl... girl power! Would you
quit speaking English?!

24:44.025 --> 24:46.482
Aeryn, be careful!

24:46.569 --> 24:48.309
Considering we're linked.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.942
I'd better go before the
females try again.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.615
I'm going to miss this planet.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.284
(muffled talking )

24:59.165 --> 25:01.156
Ho'Ock:
Anybody here?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.124
Dr. Tumii?

25:07.215 --> 25:08.421
He's tied up right now.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.964
So what?

25:10.051 --> 25:12.758
So, uh, why don't you have
a seat and wait your turn?

25:12.845 --> 25:17.134
Tell the doctor that
Ho'Ock is here. Now.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.715
(grunting)

25:18.810 --> 25:20.220
What's all the commotion?

25:20.311 --> 25:21.175
Who are you?

25:21.270 --> 25:22.976
Dr. Rygel.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.725
Tumii's at the colon convention.

25:24.816 --> 25:29.401
Uh, what seems to be
the problem? Hmm?

25:29.487 --> 25:32.103
My zergenbobs are
playing up again.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.565
(clicking tongue in sympathy)
That's what you get for
neglecting them.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.776
Take off your clothes.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.280
Here?

25:39.372 --> 25:42.614
Yes. For some preventive
bloodletting.

25:42.709 --> 25:47.829
Most anyone can benefit from
the removal of one excess
bodily fluid or another.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.629
Inflamed zergenbobs, you say?

25:50.717 --> 25:55.051
Well, I think we should
take a look, hmm?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.265
Take care of yourself.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.090
Hmm.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.269
What the hell's the
matter with you?

26:05.356 --> 26:06.436
I'm operating.

26:06.524 --> 26:07.730
(sighs)

26:07.817 --> 26:08.727
(sinister chuckling)

26:08.818 --> 26:11.059
(engines roaring and hissing)

26:21.789 --> 26:23.745
You looking for work?

26:23.833 --> 26:24.993
No.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.120
We don't open for another arn.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.827
We'd like to talk to Selva.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.378
Who?

26:31.466 --> 26:32.876
Your boss.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.332
You claim to know her?

26:34.427 --> 26:36.008
Sikozu:
No.

26:36.095 --> 26:40.213
But we have heard that she's
trying to improve conditions

26:40.308 --> 26:42.515
on this planet for females.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.558
It's a worthy cause.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.307
Causes need currency.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.481
So we'd like to discuss
a business deal.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.240
Not interested.

26:59.327 --> 27:02.239
We'd prefer to hear
that from Selva.

27:03.915 --> 27:06.031
No, you wouldn't.

27:08.169 --> 27:09.659
Sikozu, are you up for this?

27:09.754 --> 27:10.834
(grunts)

27:10.922 --> 27:13.004
(groaning)

27:13.090 --> 27:16.378
Crichton, I think the
girls are in trouble!

27:16.469 --> 27:18.130
That's brilliant, Holmes.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.961
(grunts)

27:34.529 --> 27:37.111
I am Selva.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.403
You wanted to speak to me.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.657
Not if this is how you treat
your friends.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.163
Why don't you untie us?

27:48.251 --> 27:49.536
You're not my friends.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.959
Yes, you're right.
That's a good point.

27:52.046 --> 27:55.038
We're not your friends.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.841
We've come to buy something
from you at whatever the price.

27:59.554 --> 28:03.012
Two Qatal Mollusks.

28:05.852 --> 28:09.094
Even if they're telling
the truth, we can't
take that chance.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.849
Of course not.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.807
But killing them will only
cure whoever it is they're
linked with.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.859
Leaving them free to
take revenge.

28:16.946 --> 28:20.279
However, if we keep our
captives alive...

28:20.366 --> 28:22.698
Then their partners will
be drawn here.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.026
Where they can all die at once.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.282
Ain't no way in hell I'm
wearing that.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.160
Have I spent an em shopping
for nothing?

28:30.251 --> 28:31.957
We have to get into that club.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.329
Why don't we just go as we are?

28:33.421 --> 28:37.915
The elite male clientele are all
known, and know one another.

28:38.009 --> 28:40.295
Therefore, we can't go as males.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.469
Well, I ain't going as Maid
Marian and... look at that.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.172
That is not a slimming color.
Black is a slimming color.

28:46.267 --> 28:49.134
Maybe, maybe if it was
black, but uh-uh.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.015
I wear that color all the time.

28:52.106 --> 28:55.223
Look, stay here and die
from the mollusks.

28:55.318 --> 28:56.728
I'll go alone.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.276
(exotic dance music playing )

29:13.336 --> 29:15.418
Told you we'd get in.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.042
You say that like it's
a good thing.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.089
One down, three to go.

29:21.177 --> 29:25.796
Get in, get the girls,
get the clams, get out.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.971
Over here. Keep your head down.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.852
Rygel:
We need to blend in.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.184
Blend in? Hell, when we got
here the clocks stopped.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.894
We couldn't blend in on
Butt-Ugly Night.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.104
Whadda we got here?

29:43.199 --> 29:47.033
Oh, I love a powerful woman.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.156
You put your hand on
my ass again,

29:50.247 --> 29:51.987
and I will kill you.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.498
Mujombre:
You're the first one who's
ever guessed that I wasn't really a man.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.294
Chiana:
It wasn't a guess.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.918
I know a male when I see one.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.124
Pretending to be male
isn't so bad.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.255
How do you stand covering up
who you are?

30:05.346 --> 30:07.337
Men get treated better.

30:07.431 --> 30:11.049
Well there must be lots of
places you could go where you
don't have to pretend.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.226
My home planet's a lot worse
than this one.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.099
I ran away a long time ago.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.146
Never regretted it
for a microt.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.316
Khurtanan's my home.

30:20.403 --> 30:24.191
And I won't have to masquerade
forever. Sooner or later,
women will take power.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.233
You.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.534
Put down your tools and strip.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.787
No.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.283
Hey,

30:38.212 --> 30:40.954
leave her alone.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.915
Stand clear, or you'll both die.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.670
Come on.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.426
( Scorpius growls )

30:48.514 --> 30:49.879
(snapping neck)

30:55.396 --> 30:57.887
Mujombre:
You killed Mekken.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.597
Resume your work.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.670
Let's dance.

31:28.304 --> 31:31.592
What's the problem?
You don't talk?

31:33.726 --> 31:37.890
(effeminate voice )
Darling, I don't dance.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.397
I do.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.485
Pilot:
Crichton isn't responding.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.564
His Comms may be turned off.

31:49.658 --> 31:54.152
Or he could be incapacitated,

31:55.748 --> 31:57.659
by the Qatar Mollusks.

31:57.750 --> 32:02.744
Perhaps we should contact
the planet's authorities?

32:02.838 --> 32:04.954
And if they inquire
after Mekken?

32:05.049 --> 32:08.667
Well, what can we do?

32:10.012 --> 32:14.005
You... can do nothing.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.600
(humming)

32:31.742 --> 32:33.357
Have their better halves
arrived?

32:33.452 --> 32:37.161
Can't tell. Too many new faces.

32:37.248 --> 32:40.957
Give me 50 microts, then cut
off one of their fingers.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.250
That should tell us.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.214
Isn't this nice?

32:58.853 --> 33:02.345
I really don't think I'm the
right partner for you.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.304
Ho'Ock:
I do.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.268
You know, much as I love
a man in a uniform...

33:10.156 --> 33:12.192
Shouldn't you be on duty,
or something?

33:12.283 --> 33:14.399
I am on duty.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.411
Ah, this looks promising.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.297
Yes. Excellent.

33:37.850 --> 33:38.635
You.

33:38.726 --> 33:39.886
Not her.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.973
(grunting)

33:44.356 --> 33:46.347
Is something wrong?

33:46.442 --> 33:47.978
Headache.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.151
No, not her!

33:55.242 --> 33:57.278
(gasping)

33:57.369 --> 33:58.484
Are you volunteering?

33:58.579 --> 33:59.785
é 3):? Eggs:

33:59.872 --> 34:01.328
Leave her alone.
-Shut up, Aeryn!

34:01.415 --> 34:02.621
I brought her here.
She has nothing to do with this.
-Shut up, Aeryn!

34:02.708 --> 34:04.164
Shut up!
-Fine.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.617
( scream )

34:06.712 --> 34:09.044
(grunting)

34:09.673 --> 34:10.788
Are you all right?

34:10.883 --> 34:12.839
(strangled gasp):
Yeah, I am.

34:13.427 --> 34:14.177
Cramps.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.762
Bloating.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.722
(strangled gasp)

34:22.228 --> 34:24.139
I'm a little hot.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.391
I could... I could use a drink.

34:27.358 --> 34:29.223
To the bar, shall we?

34:29.318 --> 34:31.650
(short, quiet breaths )

34:34.365 --> 34:36.606
Selva:
Didn't work. No one reacted.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.986
(dance music plays)

34:40.329 --> 34:42.320
Wait there.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.619
( quietly):
Pervert.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.325
Ryg?

34:48.420 --> 34:50.206
How you making out?

34:50.297 --> 34:51.412
I've got the Mollusks.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.338
What about the girls?
-Don't know.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.711
If they're here,
I can't find them.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.259
Well, we gotta find 'em fast.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.381
That's yourjob.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.713
I did my part. I'm leaving.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.264
You're not running out on me?

35:02.351 --> 35:03.340
I can't help it.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.266
I'm overwhelmed with dread.

35:05.354 --> 35:06.434
But that's the clams talking.

35:06.522 --> 35:09.389
And worse still, my limbs are
starting to go numb.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.893
(whimpering)
-Damn it, Rygel,

35:10.985 --> 35:12.350
The Doc told us what that meant.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.900
(quivering)

35:15.239 --> 35:17.355
Should I try the other one?

35:19.785 --> 35:24.028
It's too late. She's already
entered the final phase.

35:24.123 --> 35:27.035
The link will get more unstable
until she and her partner die.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.287
Oh!

35:29.378 --> 35:31.960
If we're not cured soon,
we're dead.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.127
You get the girls.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.456
I'll get these clams
to the doctor.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.337
It's antidote time.

35:37.428 --> 35:38.383
(wheezing )

35:38.470 --> 35:39.755
Rygel?

35:40.889 --> 35:42.049
Rygel?

35:45.102 --> 35:51.268
Pilot:
Scorpius, consuming the
remnants of the discarded mollusks seems a risky plan.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.519
Are you certain that once
you've linked with the others,

35:53.610 --> 35:57.603
you can endure the symptoms
and delay their deterioration?

35:57.698 --> 36:00.314
Certain, no.

36:01.327 --> 36:05.036
Confident, yes.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.221
Pilot:
I tried once more to
contact them,

36:28.312 --> 36:30.598
but there's still
no response from...

36:30.689 --> 36:32.645
Proknoth!

36:32.733 --> 36:34.598
(sighs)

36:34.693 --> 36:36.979
Noranti...

36:37.821 --> 36:40.312
I'm really thirsty.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.147
Oh, it's gorgeous.

36:42.242 --> 36:43.823
(giggIeS)

36:43.911 --> 36:45.993
But I don't want any more.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.196
Let's get this filter in place.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.421
That ought to do it.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.252
Pilot?

37:00.344 --> 37:02.676
Restore the primary path and
see if it's all working.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.254
Restoring now.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.465
(whirring )

37:07.559 --> 37:10.050
(powering up)

37:11.021 --> 37:13.182
Uncanny.

37:13.273 --> 37:16.310
It's so quiet.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.235
The filter works perfectly.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.063
Moya and I sincerely thank you.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.739
You gonna be all right?

37:24.827 --> 37:25.737
On Khurtanan?

37:27.371 --> 37:29.407
Name change, new identity.

37:34.336 --> 37:35.701
(sighs)

37:35.796 --> 37:38.162
I've done it before.
I've got friends who'll help.

37:38.257 --> 37:41.420
I'll probably wind up with
an even betterjob.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.133
You're a frelling optimist.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.213
Hard to be a revolutionary
if you're not.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.099
Crichton:
No, really. I should go
powder my face.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.847
Mm-hmm.
-Oh.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.054
I think you look beautiful
just as you are.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.480
No, you don't.
-Mmm, yes, I do.

37:56.567 --> 37:59.809
The moment I saw you,
in the doctor's office.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.733
(pained quivering)

38:03.824 --> 38:05.815
You couldn't fool me
for a microt.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.286
Not with face like that.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.156
All right.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.078
Here's the deal.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.167
I lost a bet.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.912
There's no need to lie to me.

38:16.003 --> 38:19.291
If you treat me nicely, I might
not even have to arrest you.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.336
Arrest?

38:20.424 --> 38:22.380
(spasmodic grunting)

38:22.468 --> 38:24.333
Dressing up is not a crime.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.168
Yes, it is.

38:26.263 --> 38:29.346
But impersonating a doctor
is an even worse one.

38:29.433 --> 38:33.972
Central Registry shows no record
of your off-world friend.

38:34.062 --> 38:38.226
Who is he, and where is he?

38:38.317 --> 38:44.608
This won't help you without
your linked partner, you know?

38:44.698 --> 38:48.190
So, why don't you, uh,

38:48.285 --> 38:51.197
set me... free?

38:51.288 --> 38:53.495
Shut up! Work!

38:53.582 --> 38:56.289
There's only one thing I like
more than dancing.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.365
Hmm?

38:57.461 --> 38:59.622
Interrogations.

38:59.713 --> 39:03.331
Long, hard interrogations.

39:03.425 --> 39:04.460
Oh, God.

39:14.144 --> 39:18.137
(spasmodic quivering)

39:19.816 --> 39:21.101
(thudding)

39:21.193 --> 39:24.151
You'll tell me now or
you'll tell me later.

39:29.743 --> 39:32.280
(abrupt gasping)

39:33.372 --> 39:35.203
I'm told it's a terrible death.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.326
(shuddenng)

39:37.417 --> 39:39.624
Wish I could make it quicker.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.331
( laughs )

39:42.422 --> 39:45.914
(shuddenng)

39:54.393 --> 39:56.224
(spastic groaning )

40:01.191 --> 40:03.227
Ooh.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.368
Get your hands...

40:26.133 --> 40:29.091
( screaming )

40:34.308 --> 40:35.844
My... my nose!

40:35.934 --> 40:38.721
You bit off my nose!

40:38.812 --> 40:42.020
There's plenty left.
Now, get back to work.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.442
(quick, shallow breathing )

40:51.366 --> 40:53.152
Don't be shy.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.159
( barks )

40:57.247 --> 40:58.828
(grunts)

41:23.523 --> 41:24.683
(grunts)

41:27.402 --> 41:29.017
(sighs)

41:29.112 --> 41:31.899
I thought we were done.
What happened?

41:31.990 --> 41:34.151
I do not know.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.280
Why did you volunteer
your finger?

41:40.040 --> 41:43.282
Do your appendages reattach?

41:49.132 --> 41:51.464
Tell me of anything
suspicious at all.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.274
(taking a breath )

42:16.201 --> 42:18.692
Don't ask. It was Rygel's idea.

42:18.787 --> 42:21.324
He's got the clams. We gotta
figure out a way to
get out of here.

42:21.415 --> 42:23.656
All the exits are guarded.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.203
Maybe something I can do.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.208
Hurry.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.052
Excuse me, ladies.

42:38.140 --> 42:40.131
Can I have your attention?

42:40.225 --> 42:41.635
Do any of you have...
-Give me that.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.059
...one of these under
your skirt?

42:44.146 --> 42:45.386
Now.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.392
Aeryn!

42:54.656 --> 42:56.567
Yeah! Girl power!

42:56.658 --> 42:57.773
( panicked chatter)

42:57.868 --> 42:59.324
( screaming )

43:02.330 --> 43:06.289
That's it. Just one more bite.

43:06.376 --> 43:07.582
Mmm, mmm.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.500
Oh, good.

43:09.588 --> 43:13.297
Oh, thank you for preparing
the cures.

43:13.383 --> 43:18.173
I'll leave this mollusk in
the garbage... outside.

43:18.263 --> 43:24.429
But it will be consumed by
drozil flies or a wild flibisk.

43:24.519 --> 43:27.511
You can't do that to me.

43:27.606 --> 43:30.188
I risk to differ.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.560
Mmm.

43:31.651 --> 43:35.269
Nice mollusk.

43:35.363 --> 43:38.776
What's that? One more mouthful?

43:41.620 --> 43:44.282
Hmm. Oh.

43:44.372 --> 43:47.364
Oh! Look at that.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.201
Isn't that amazing?

43:50.295 --> 43:52.286
Now that, we study.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.872
No, that we will throw away.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.674
Everyone, the cure works.
Ours is finished.

43:58.762 --> 44:00.252
D, how long did yours take?

44:00.347 --> 44:01.211
Noranti:
No time at all.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.842
Frelling forever.

44:02.933 --> 44:04.343
Both:
Three arns.

44:04.434 --> 44:06.345
Three arns?
-Oh, that's not that long.

44:06.436 --> 44:08.051
For some.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.764
Crichton:
Well, put your hands together
and feel the power.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.564
Yeah! Out with the evil spirits!

44:13.652 --> 44:14.767
Give me your hand, Ryg.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.692
Go away.

44:16.780 --> 44:18.236
I'm hungry.

44:18.323 --> 44:21.736
You're not eating anything until
we are completely separated.

44:21.827 --> 44:25.035
Sikozu:
The antidote has already
dissolved our emotional linkages.

44:25.121 --> 44:27.498
I don't want to take
any chances.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.322
Rygel:
I, uh, hate to bring this up,

44:29.417 --> 44:31.954
but Scorpius ate the
mollusks, as well.

44:32.045 --> 44:37.210
Yes. To link with the four of
us and temporarily override
our symptoms.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.677
We would be dead by now
if he had not.

44:39.761 --> 44:41.422
(grunting)

44:42.389 --> 44:45.096
(panting)
