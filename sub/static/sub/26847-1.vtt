00:25.593 --> 00:27.428
- Mind if I join you?

00:27.428 --> 00:28.428
- Be my guest.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.105
- I've heard great
things about you.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.772
- Likewise.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.675
- This group is top shelf

00:41.675 --> 00:44.712
and we have extensive resources.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.480
- Like the artifact?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.881
- Caught wind of that already?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.383
- Rumors abound.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.951
But what does it do?

00:50.951 --> 00:52.386
Is it here yet?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.855
- We don't reveal
everything to new members.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.257
- That's a pity.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.925
- It's a rude policy.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.793
- Decidedly, but I
just want to know

00:59.793 --> 01:01.195
for scheduling purposes.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.797
- Of course, of course.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.400
Diovolo's gonna demonstrate
the artifact at midnight.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.802
What harm is there
in saying that?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.605
- No harm at all and
how polite of you.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.906
- I'm trying to be a gentleman.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.442
- How's that working out?

01:14.442 --> 01:18.011
- Let's just say if I were to
kill you for being an imposter

01:18.011 --> 01:20.248
I'd do it quickly to
avoid any suffering.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.049
- Your suffering or mine?

01:22.049 --> 01:24.152
- This is a morbid subject.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.654
- That's par for the course
in this cult isn't it?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.190
- You can't
make an amulet,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.758
without cracking a few eggs.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.027
- You have a way with words.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.729
- Let's just say I'm
a man of letters.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.897
- The wrong way?

01:36.897 --> 01:38.332
- Having second thoughts?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.733
- About speaking with you?

01:39.733 --> 01:41.269
- About joining
the organization?

01:41.269 --> 01:43.937
- Oh, you're organized?
I hadn't noticed.

01:43.937 --> 01:48.476
- You know, some of us here,
are cold-blooded killers.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.977
- As am I.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.045
How many people have you killed?

01:52.045 --> 01:54.081
- Lots, a myriad.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.186
- It sounds to me like
you're avoiding the question.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.453
- Eight, okay?

02:00.621 --> 02:01.822
- Not bad.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.656
- And how about you?

02:02.656 --> 02:04.658
- How about me what?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.160
- How many men have you slain?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.396
- How many men or
people in total?

02:09.396 --> 02:11.131
Because they weren't all men.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.065
- In total.

02:13.934 --> 02:14.934
- It's a secret.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.506
- You can tell me,
we're all friends here.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.174
- Cold-blooded friends?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.742
- Who's avoiding
the questions now?

02:23.277 --> 02:25.446
- How many men have I cut
down this month or today?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.651
- You better put
that away, honey.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.952
You're getting me excited.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.464
- Excuse me, I
have to use the restroom.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.900
- She's on the move,
what's her location?

02:48.101 --> 02:49.634
- Moving into
the main corridor.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.008
- Keradin, are you there?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.545
- Give her a chance to
get back on the coms.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.223
- Coms on, okay.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.658
I'm looking for the artifact.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.160
- Nice of you to show up.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.231
Right on time.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.734
- What's the situation?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.372
- Keradin's on the move
to the expected location

03:24.372 --> 03:25.539
of the artifact.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.974
- Excellent.

03:26.974 --> 03:31.011
Unfortunately, I've just
found out that things might be

03:31.011 --> 03:33.547
a little trickier
than we planned.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.115
- What do you mean?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.964
- Guys, we have a
serious problem.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.766
There's a bomb on the artifact.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.135
- Can we get a cam on that?

04:02.376 --> 04:05.012
- Okay, camera one in
place, do you see it?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.314
- That does not look good.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.286
Okay, high confidence
for situation B.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.187
- Situation B?

04:14.187 --> 04:16.223
- Diovolo is the traitor.

04:16.223 --> 04:19.293
He has the disarming
key for the bomb.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.628
- Diovolo?

04:20.628 --> 04:21.862
He's the leader of this cult,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.497
why would he blow
up the artifact?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.166
- Because he's bat-shit crazy?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.471
- Why wasn't I informed
of this before?

04:34.808 --> 04:38.612
- We just got the intel
in while you were cajoling

04:38.612 --> 04:40.614
the bad guys to like you.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.182
Wincroft doesn't even know yet.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.319
- Oh, shit.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.988
Can the EOD tech walk me through

04:47.988 --> 04:49.557
disarming this bomb right now?

04:50.858 --> 04:53.794
- No, it could be booby-trapped,

04:53.794 --> 04:56.096
and you don't have
the proper tools.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.766
Get the key, you have...

05:00.368 --> 05:01.234
12 minutes.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.375
- What the hell?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.709
- What is it?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.678
- Nothing, com silence now.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.185
- Where'd the chick go?

05:19.052 --> 05:20.187
- Bathroom.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.589
What do you care?

05:21.589 --> 05:22.756
- I don't like her.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.257
- You don't like me?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.229
- No, I don't.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.298
- That's too bad.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.637
- Okay, assholes, let's
get the show on the road.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.654
Take a seat.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.832
- Before we begin, I
wanna bring attention

06:04.832 --> 06:09.169
to the fact that we have two
new guests at our circle.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.639
- Yeah, how can we
trust these people?

06:11.639 --> 06:14.708
- As a matter of fact, we can't.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.478
As far as we know, they're feds.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.917
- Shit, what do we do?

06:25.352 --> 06:29.222
- There's nothing we can do,
they have to figure this out.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.259
- It's getting too hot in
there, should we abort?

06:32.259 --> 06:35.629
- No, do you realize
how important this is?

06:35.629 --> 06:39.500
If they don't get that thing
out of there in five minutes

06:39.500 --> 06:41.469
we are all screwed.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.604
- So, we frisk them.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.942
- Hey, stud, you can
frisk me all you want.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.879
- Cut the shit, what
do you think this is?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.616
Okay, clowns, listen up.

06:58.018 --> 07:02.956
She's kosher, my uncle Joe was
in the slammer with her pop

07:04.391 --> 07:08.629
back in the day before we
skedaddled to South America.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.299
- Your uncle Joe?

07:12.299 --> 07:17.304
'Cause he's real
reliable, stand up guy.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.176
- As I was saying.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.417
The only problem we have
at present with personnel

07:30.417 --> 07:32.252
is Stiffy McBigHead here.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.791
- So, Wincroft,
you wanna tell me--

07:46.534 --> 07:49.269
Practically a reasonable
explanation, Wincroft.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.110
It's too bad it's the wrong one.

07:58.912 --> 07:59.912
Frisk him.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.732
Keradin, since you're
the newest one of us,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.635
how about you do the honors?
- With pleasure.

08:25.573 --> 08:30.578
- You may be a
bad-ass, but your aim sucks.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.953
So, what's wrong?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.793
- Nothing.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.464
As the leader, I figured
you should have the honor.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.701
- You're much too kind.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.170
- Am I?

09:02.776 --> 09:05.746
- Hey, you're gettin'
blood on my suit there.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.914
- I'm such a mess.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.348
I'll run to the bathroom
and clean it off.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.893
The bomb.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.037
Ordinance defused.

09:30.037 --> 09:30.871
I need...

09:38.078 --> 09:39.680
I need an exit now.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.496
- I thought I told you
to take two weeks off?

09:56.496 --> 09:59.667
- I'll give you two
weeks, two weeks notice.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.635
- I understand what
you're going through.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.670
You'll get over it.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.572
- I have gotten over it.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.208
I've gotten over the false
promise of harmless intrigue.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.611
- Dr. Keradin, remember when
I found you at the university?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.146
- Cut the reminiscent bullshit.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.751
- So, you're just going to quit?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.120
- This isn't my thing.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.825
- Is it because of Wincroft?

10:24.825 --> 10:25.826
- What do you think?

10:48.882 --> 10:49.683
- Here.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.158
You can keep that.

10:59.159 --> 10:59.960
- Thanks.

11:01.929 --> 11:02.930
- Where will you go?

11:04.397 --> 11:08.201
- Back to university, my old
advisor has a funding slot.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.503
- Well, isn't that swell.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.473
- Yeah, I'll be a post-doc.
- Exciting.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.609
- Well, at least you don't
die, except for your soul.

11:16.609 --> 11:20.647
- Agent Keradin, you will
be bored out of your brain.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.481
- We'll see.

11:31.591 --> 11:32.860
- Sorry I'm late.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.595
My best agent has left me.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.834
I met her because of you.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.498
But don't worry about that,
I'm sure I'll see her again.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.105
And soon, we'll have
your other half.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.640
- Keradin, where
the heck have you been?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.175
- I was in the neuro
lab for a while.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.577
- This is a nightmare, how
do you shut this thing off?

13:04.952 --> 13:06.053
- There, it's stopped.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.992
- What the sam hell
is going on here?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.460
- I don't know.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.128
- This is supposed to be a
reproduction of an experiment

13:15.128 --> 13:17.764
that does not involve
people screaming.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.101
- It is, I swear it was
going exactly as expected

13:21.101 --> 13:24.037
five minutes ago.
- Did you change the protocol?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.805
- I may have tested
a new subject.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.141
- Look, I know you like
to push the boundaries.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.344
- That's what science is about.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.847
- Please, I need you to
start off on the right foot.

13:33.847 --> 13:37.150
Namely, the foot that keeps
the funding coming in.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.587
- Okay, but there is something
bizarre happening here.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.755
- Are you saying you can't
handle a simple experiment?

13:42.755 --> 13:43.823
- I can handle it.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.627
- Good, oh, and also,
I need you to finish

13:47.627 --> 13:50.030
that perception paper I'm
letting you co-author.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.733
Publish or perish.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.842
- Listen up, we've
located the artifact.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.878
- I thought we already got that.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.148
- There are two parts,
this is the second half.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.250
- What exactly is this
thing, some kinda weapon?

14:10.250 --> 14:14.454
- Sorry, that requires a higher
level of security clearance.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.289
- But we're gonna seize it.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.159
- Absolutely and it
has to happen tomorrow.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.427
- Tomorrow?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.795
- The criminal world
has learned of it, too,

14:22.795 --> 14:25.498
and the crew is planning
on heisting it tomorrow.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.500
So we have to get
in there first,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.170
and get the artifact intact.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.205
- Nice, I love clip art.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.343
- But I already reserved
tomorrow as my day off.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.311
- Not anymore, Agent Paquin.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.112
- But it's
already gone through

14:39.112 --> 14:40.580
in the payroll system.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.483
- The location is the Cognitive
Science Research laboratory

14:43.483 --> 14:44.417
in Cambridge.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.164
- Keradin, are you leaving?

14:57.164 --> 14:57.998
- Yeah.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.067
- Early day, huh?

15:01.268 --> 15:02.869
That's cool, I'll
see you tomorrow,

15:02.869 --> 15:05.172
but I wanna show you the
gadget for the build.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
- Okay, sure, later.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.282
- Tomorrow.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.818
- Wow, on schedule for
once, any last minute intel?

15:18.818 --> 15:21.388
- I'm going to see
The Veil right now.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.691
- Years of investigation
culminates in tomorrow's incursion.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.527
- I heard we got quite
the list of potentials.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.361
- Indeed we do.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.781
- This is Nevil "The
Devil" Hellinger.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.684
- Primarily a thief,
but difficult to catch,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.220
impossible to incriminate.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.324
And these are the others
that we're tracking.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.026
- Sounds like a dangerous bunch.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.928
- But they are not
counting on us being there.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.532
- We're counting on all
these dickheads to be there?

16:05.532 --> 16:06.833
- Bet my good looks on it.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.304
Wanker number one,
Maskin, the leader.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.307
Also known as The Confiscator.
- Why?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.643
- Well, 'cause he
always gets the goods.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.046
Said goods then disappear
into bureaucracy,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.180
never to be seen again.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.918
- I remember him,
the New York job.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.887
- Yeah, the one you
failed to complete?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.223
- What can I say? Bad intel.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.458
I'll tell you one thing,

16:31.458 --> 16:33.493
I'm not letting Maskin
gum up another job.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.996
- Smells like boiling
resentment to me.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.213
Then there's that shadowy twat.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.914
- I don't recognize her.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.916
- Oh, we don't know
much about her.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.985
Could be going by
the alias Overstreet.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.354
- Looks sinister.
- Nah.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.156
She is a squiffy git
but she is professional.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.858
- At what?
- Well, for one thing.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.428
She's top-notch at
hiding her identity.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.563
She's uninvestigatable.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.763
- Uninvestigatable?
- Mm-hm.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.333
- Is that a word?
- Well, I don't know.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.934
Let me just check my dictionary.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.005
- And why do we care
about Miss Overstreet?

17:19.872 --> 17:20.807
- For one thing...

17:23.376 --> 17:26.979
Because she's been hanging
around with that tosser Maskin.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.881
- That is suspicious.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.151
- Yeah, or just some
innocent perky tootling.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.321
- She's a wild card.

17:34.321 --> 17:38.591
- Might I suggest some extra
distraction for this job?

17:38.591 --> 17:41.994
- You might, and I
know just who to call.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.207
- Hello, Hellinger,
you son of a bitch.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.044
Yeah, that's right up our alley.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.651
We got a gig tomorrow.
- What kind?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.086
- Distraction.
- That's it?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.790
- Hey, money's money.
- It's not a lot of money.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.125
- You're really gonna say
that while you fan yourself

18:12.125 --> 18:14.261
with 10 grand over there?

18:14.261 --> 18:15.495
- Why dick around
with thousands,

18:15.495 --> 18:17.564
when we could deal in millions?

18:17.564 --> 18:18.798
- What're you blabbering about?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.401
- I happen to know that
Hellinger's nicking

18:21.401 --> 18:23.570
an extremely valuable object.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.872
- How valuable?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.907
- 15 mil, at least.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.944
- And all it'll cost us is
five fingers and a bit of fear.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.979
- Now you're talking.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.584
- What is it, some science shit?

18:38.918 --> 18:41.888
Hellinger says the target's
a research facility.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.590
- Ancient artifact.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.424
It's rare.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.759
One of a kind.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.131
- Why the hell is it
in a research building?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.600
- I don't know.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.736
- I don't like it,
I don't know enough.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.405
- We know enough
to be dangerous.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.909
- I do have contacts in
high-end antiques that could

19:02.909 --> 19:04.311
convert this to cash for us.

19:06.213 --> 19:09.249
- See? It'll work out perfectly.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.751
- Are you sure this is the gig
Hellinger's doin' tomorrow?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.286
- Yeah.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.754
- Where'd you get this picture?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.723
- I've been working
Hellinger's driver.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.792
- You cheeky flirt.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.237
- You're so chill, Keradin.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.171
Even when you're
under a lot of stress.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.074
- Yeah right, Valerie,
I'm freaking out.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.309
- What's wrong?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.378
- I don't think I can
do this post-doc thing.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.213
I wanna get out and
find something else.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.014
- That could set
you back a year!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.516
- I know, I know.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.318
- You can't
keep quitting.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.122
Uh, I mean, doing new things
before finishing old things.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.193
- Well, sometimes quitting
is the right thing to do.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.764
- You quit everything.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.998
- No, I don't!

20:00.132 --> 20:00.967
- Shots?

20:06.172 --> 20:10.343
♪ Baby, your lips keep movin'

20:10.343 --> 20:14.080
- I worry about you.
- I worry about you.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.449
Do you still hear
voices in your head?

20:16.449 --> 20:19.386
- Can the voices in my head
hear voices in their heads?

20:19.386 --> 20:22.389
- That would indicate an
infinite recursion of homunculi

20:22.389 --> 20:24.223
in your mind, which
is impossible.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.629
- Let's go dancing.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.551
- There are chunks
in this coffee.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.255
- Those are flavor crystals.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.973
- Blackwood, check
the perimeter.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.107
- Sure thing.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.676
- Everybody else, come with me.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.782
- What a marvelous day
to check the perimeter.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.287
- Mobile jammers ready?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.492
- Jammers are on.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.861
- Make sure the entire
routers are reconfigured too.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.231
- Already done.
- Okay.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.968
I'm waiting on the distraction.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.838
- The distraction should be
coming up any minute now.

22:22.241 --> 22:25.712
- Agent Maskin, I never
imagined I'd see you here again.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.547
What do you want?

22:27.547 --> 22:30.182
- We're doing a small
operation, should be quick.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.551
- In a research center?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.219
- How would you
like to assist us?

22:33.219 --> 22:35.655
- No, I don't work
for you anymore.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.458
I don't know what you're up
to and I want no part of it.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.529
- Time is critical,
so goodbye, Keradin.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.164
It was lovely to see you again.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.132
- As always.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.403
- I'm headed to the third floor.

22:50.403 --> 22:53.239
Wait here and watch
for Hellinger.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.513
- Nevil "The Devil" Hellinger
is a notorious antiques thief.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.483
- Hey, she doesn't need
to know that, Paquin.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.984
She's bailin'.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.486
Right, Keradin?

23:06.486 --> 23:11.491
- Right.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.995
Is it raining outside?

23:17.129 --> 23:18.330
- No, why?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.701
- This is a pre-recorded video.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.170
- Shit, they're in
the god-damn building.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.004
- Who is?

23:26.372 --> 23:28.841
- Ulrich, get to the lobby,
alert the desk guard.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.643
- Right.
- Now, hold on a minute.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.945
You promised to
keep this discrete.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.515
- Ziebeck, you and Finkley sweep
the rest of the first floor

23:35.515 --> 23:36.849
then go up to the second floor.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.084
- Yes, ma'am.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.051
- I'll go straight up
to the third floor.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.754
Wocheck, you stay here.
- Hey!

23:41.754 --> 23:45.558
I am the supervisor of
personnel security, okay?

23:45.558 --> 23:48.160
- Nobody else sneaks in!

23:48.160 --> 23:50.196
- This is crazy, I'm outta here.

23:50.196 --> 23:53.065
- You know, that's a good idea.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.468
Ulrich, escort
Keradin out as well.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.242
- Is that who I think it is?

24:04.944 --> 24:09.081
- Roald "Rhino Serious" Nash
and his amorous accomplice

24:09.081 --> 24:12.619
Ada Griff, AKA Silver Adder.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.454
- Not exactly
stealth operators, are they?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.824
- Shut up and go give
Ulrich some backup.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.325
Go around the east corridor.

24:24.997 --> 24:25.832
- Where do
you think you're goin'?

24:25.832 --> 24:26.933
Up against the wall!

24:31.437 --> 24:34.306
- Wish I could be a
guide and get a cute hat.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.711
- Listen up, all you Fairweather
fans of thrills and kills!

24:40.046 --> 24:41.047
- You need to leave.

24:44.517 --> 24:47.887
- Everyone stand still
and enjoy the party.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.129
- Who are these bastards?

24:57.129 --> 24:58.164
- Thieves.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.431
- In lockdown.

24:59.431 --> 25:02.201
- Why are they here?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.636
Shit.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.237
- Turzillo, you stay
here and guard the lobby.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.339
- I'll take the security room.
- Right.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.208
Let's go.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.780
- Here, just in case.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.982
- I am not getting
involved in this mission.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.018
- Sorry, no time for chit-chat.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.491
- Take this.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.334
- Look, I
need to get outta here.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.803
- Tell me about.
- Can you cover for me?

25:36.803 --> 25:38.304
I'm gonna make a
run for the door.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.007
- No, that's not a good idea.
- Why not?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.643
- These guys were in the
dossier, they're deadly.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.277
- Who else is in the dossier?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.079
- Just some criminals
that are also lookin'

25:47.079 --> 25:48.681
for the artifact.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.883
- The artifact, what artifact?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.519
- I'm not supposed
to talk about that.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.991
- The artifact that I have
already retrieved for Maskin?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.930
- Not exactly, there are
two parts to the artifact.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.698
- And what are they?

26:05.698 --> 26:07.734
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.436
Why haven't I heard about
different artifacts existing?

26:11.638 --> 26:13.873
- It's probably on a
need-to-know basis.

26:13.873 --> 26:14.741
- Lockdown?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.175
Who's activating this?

26:19.378 --> 26:24.383
- Can I help you?

26:40.867 --> 26:42.935
- "Keradin, neuropsychology."

26:44.036 --> 26:45.638
- Who are you, another criminal?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.307
- I'm The Devil.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.010
- Nevil "The
Devil" the antique thief?

26:58.184 --> 26:59.018
Hey!

27:20.707 --> 27:23.275
- Soon, this will all be over.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.548
- Humans couldn't see blue
until the Middle Ages.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.317
- Don't be absurd.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.320
Our eyes couldn't change that
rapidly in such a short time.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.322
- Well, sure, humans could
see blue wavelengths,

27:36.322 --> 27:38.590
but they didn't have the
mental category for it yet.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.860
- Our conscious minds
were blind to blue?

27:40.860 --> 27:42.795
- Exactly.
- You're full of shit.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.595
Hey!

27:43.595 --> 27:44.430
Jerk!

27:48.100 --> 27:49.702
- Rhino, I'm in security.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.071
- Good.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.672
Watch out for the Federal trash.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.179
- It's Hellinger, freeze!

28:01.313 --> 28:02.715
- Looking for these?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.658
- What's goin' on?
- Donald!

28:12.658 --> 28:14.093
- Did you notice the
networks are down?

28:14.093 --> 28:16.162
It's really strange.
- What about cell phones?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.696
- I don't have a connection.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.132
- Okay, some criminals did
infiltrate this building.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.067
- What, really?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.469
I wonder.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.337
- Did you see any FBI
agents walking through here?

28:25.337 --> 28:26.973
- I saw a couple of
suits a few minutes ago

28:26.973 --> 28:28.875
on the other side.
- Okay.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.809
You should head back to the lab,

28:29.809 --> 28:31.944
and stay there until it's safe.

28:31.944 --> 28:32.779
- If you say so.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.115
- Where's Maskin?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.285
- Keradin, you're still here?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.686
- Unfortunately, yes,

28:40.686 --> 28:42.755
and I know you're
looking for the artifact.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.125
- Well, do you know where it is?

28:46.125 --> 28:49.061
Our intel said it was in this
room, but we can't find it.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.132
- I have an idea where it
might be, but where's Maskin?

28:55.034 --> 28:56.635
- Searching the fourth floor.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.948
- Where the hell
did my badge go?

29:17.756 --> 29:18.724
- I'm in position.

29:19.725 --> 29:20.559
Room 771.

29:23.129 --> 29:23.963
Lorrie?

29:25.832 --> 29:28.767
Lorrie, Lorrie, are you there?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.036
- Sorry, buddy.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.707
Rhino, this is Lorrie.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.476
Hellinger's in room 771.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.348
- Good, keep him there.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.718
Silver, you catch that?
- Got it, room 771.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.260
Room 771 is locked down.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.629
- Shit.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.911
- Well well, I
thought you went home.

30:11.911 --> 30:15.314
- I tried, you wanna tell
me what this artifact is?

30:15.314 --> 30:18.450
- Let's just say it
endangers public safety.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.388
- Why is it here, why is
it in my research facility?

30:22.388 --> 30:24.323
- With all due respect,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.893
your security clearance
is no longer active.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.694
- Okay,
I don't care anyway.

30:28.694 --> 30:31.430
I want you guys and the
damn artifact outta here.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.765
- Look, just help us out.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.502
You know this building
better than me.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.239
We'll get you outta here as
soon as we find the artifact.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.142
- Okay, this better be quick.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.914
- I got bad news.
- Spit it out.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.416
- We've got a dead
body downstairs in 303.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.851
- That's my lab.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.784
He was my old advisor.

31:26.685 --> 31:27.519
- I'm sorry.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.291
- Rhino and his vermin
made it to this floor.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.225
- Why didn't you stop them?

31:33.225 --> 31:34.526
- I was following them to see

31:34.526 --> 31:37.229
if they knew where
the artifact was.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.299
- Well, stop them now before
they endanger our operation.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.300
- Yes, sir.

31:43.169 --> 31:47.406
- Keradin, where would
somebody hide a valuable asset,

31:47.406 --> 31:49.408
like the artifact,
in this building?

31:50.842 --> 31:53.745
- I don't know but I've heard
they have highly-secretive

31:53.745 --> 31:55.681
projects on the eighth floor.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.250
- Thanks, you should stay
here out of harm's way.

31:59.385 --> 32:00.319
- But--
- Let's go.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.875
- That sounded
like an explosion.

32:23.875 --> 32:24.876
- Go check it out.

32:26.112 --> 32:26.945
- Now what?

32:39.858 --> 32:41.527
- This is all wrong.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.780
- Holy shit.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.049
Hey!

33:15.327 --> 33:17.996
- Damn it, I left the camera
rolling since yesterday.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.200
Wait a minute.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.305
Maskin.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.376
- You told me it
was in room 371.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.944
- And you told me you'd
have money for me.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.913
- And you're wasting my time.

33:34.913 --> 33:35.847
- Holy shit.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.358
- You should not have seen that.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.628
- Well, I did.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.130
- You should have
left like a good girl.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.433
You should quit
while you're, well--

33:54.433 --> 33:56.835
- Ahead?
- Alive.

34:05.911 --> 34:06.745
- What the...

34:24.929 --> 34:27.533
- Shh, I hear something.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.202
- Touch my face again and
I'll break your fingers.

34:30.202 --> 34:33.172
- I need my fingers.
- What do you want?

34:33.172 --> 34:34.773
- I think you know.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.609
- Do you hear that?

35:24.456 --> 35:25.991
- Well, that got sticky.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.294
- Ulrich, get your
ass to room 500.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.930
Everybody listen.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.433
- Rhino and his two comrades
have been taken care of.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.569
- Don't interrupt me.
- Sorry, sir.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.705
- Keradin is working
with the thieves.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.707
She killed her advisor
and shot at me.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.476
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.246
Now, go find Keradin
and the other thieves.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.247
- Force?

35:48.247 --> 35:50.216
- Use lethal force if necessary.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.584
- Yes, sir.
- You, come with me.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.153
We'll continue the
artifact search.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.823
And if you see
something, say something.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.498
- I need your help.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.835
- Did you see that back there?
- What, the chairs?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.537
I'm sure that's Rhino's doing.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.641
- There's some weird-ass
shit going on around here.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.943
- I'm not sure what you mean.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.247
- What part of weird-ass
shit don't you understand?

36:21.247 --> 36:22.814
- The weird?

36:22.814 --> 36:23.849
And the ass.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.187
- There's something
about the artifact.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.189
- Something
you'd like to share?

36:32.057 --> 36:33.325
- Shit.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.926
Don't change the subject.

36:34.926 --> 36:38.063
- Get off me!

36:40.098 --> 36:42.701
- The artifact, what is it?
- A device.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.870
- For what?
- I don't know.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.380
- Know how to use that?

37:04.956 --> 37:07.559
I'll take that as a yes.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.481
- This is getting
out of control.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.082
- My team double-crossed me.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.819
Agents are tryin' to kill you.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.187
We need to work together.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.158
- You think I know where
the artifact is, don't you?

37:40.158 --> 37:41.493
- Do you?

37:41.493 --> 37:44.062
- Do you realize Maskin
is killing people?

37:44.062 --> 37:44.996
- So what?

37:46.432 --> 37:48.934
- There's something alien
about this whole ordeal.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.802
- Alien?
- Yes.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.639
I worked with Maskin when we
obtained the first artifact.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.240
- First?
- This is the second one.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.742
Maskin's obsessed
with the first one,

37:56.742 --> 37:59.611
and he's even more obsessed
with the second one.

37:59.611 --> 38:04.049
- Big deal, what's so
strange, so alien about that?

38:05.384 --> 38:07.252
- I don't know, I keep
having these weird daydreams.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.887
Maybe hallucinations.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.389
- Fascinating.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.491
- What's worrying me is this
glowing image I'm seeing.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.925
Like it's coming
from the artifact.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.927
- What kind of image?

38:15.927 --> 38:17.563
- Like a display,
a progress bar.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.965
- Progress is good, right?
- Not if it's counting down.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.201
- Counting down to what?
- Something catastrophic?

38:23.201 --> 38:25.003
Maybe a massive
bomb, I'm not sure.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.406
- Well, we'd better find it,

38:27.406 --> 38:29.274
before Maskin gets
his dirty hands on it.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.076
- Right, maybe it's
on the eighth floor.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.379
- Let's go, clock's ticking.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.380
- Give me the watch.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.415
- Ready?

38:49.294 --> 38:52.263
- Step out now or we
will move with force.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.013
- Is it just me or did
the door just disappear?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.548
- Yeah, it did.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.350
- That's disconcerting.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.220
- I wonder, is it the whole
room or just the door?

39:16.422 --> 39:18.323
- I should've brought
more explosives.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.227
- Maskin's tryin' to stop
us with all his tricks now.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.062
- Maybe we've been drugged.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.864
You've been having
hallucinations.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.266
- I've researched
hallucinations.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.936
I don't think this
is one of them.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.077
Auditory, tactile visual.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.279
When both says the
same thing, it's real.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.814
- Well, if it's real,

39:42.814 --> 39:45.884
we're dealing with the best
illusionist I've ever seen.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.718
- What's that?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.122
What if Maskin turned my office

39:51.122 --> 39:52.824
into a prison cell
with the artifact?

39:52.824 --> 39:55.226
- How?

39:55.226 --> 39:56.294
- The artifact could
be some kind of

39:56.294 --> 39:57.496
materialization machine.

39:58.664 --> 39:59.998
- That's highly unlikely.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.601
- It also explains
why it's so valuable.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.236
- I'm gonna stick
with hallucinations.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.075
- If I'm right, I might
be able to use my brain

40:10.075 --> 40:11.376
to get us out of here.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.745
- Well, definitely
use your brain.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.547
- No, I mean there's the
connection into my brain

40:15.547 --> 40:18.149
with the external to my skull.

40:18.149 --> 40:18.984
- What?

40:20.351 --> 40:22.420
- The hallucinations first
started with the first artifact.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.523
What if the hallucinations
are caused by the artifacts

40:24.523 --> 40:26.992
sending signals to
my visual cortex?

40:26.992 --> 40:28.460
- Like wifi?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.829
- Sort of, but I'm not
sure how that's possible.

40:32.498 --> 40:35.667
If only I could focus
on these images.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.623
- You look like
a crash test dummy.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.091
- Shut up,
I'm focusing now.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.392
- What do you see?

41:01.392 --> 41:02.861
- Symbols.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.030
That's all the different
kinds of symbols I'm seeing.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.431
- How does this help us?

41:06.431 --> 41:07.766
- Neural
interfaces are usually

41:07.766 --> 41:08.934
two-way connections.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.839
- You can send symbols
to the artifact?

41:13.839 --> 41:15.173
- I'm going to try.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.007
Okay.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.710
Now I just have to
do the opposite.

41:18.710 --> 41:22.113
Blow out the unit
with my normal vision.

41:22.113 --> 41:26.785
- So, you look at something
and it sees what you see?

41:26.785 --> 41:28.286
- That's
what I'd guess.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.921
- Something's supposed to
be happening right now?

41:29.921 --> 41:30.922
- Hold on.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.660
- It's working.
- These must be commands then.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.395
But how do I get it to finish?
- Which one did you look at?

41:37.395 --> 41:39.765
- This one.
- Keep looking at that one.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.266
- That's not working, though.

41:41.266 --> 41:45.971
Wait, the symbols sent to my
brain came in groups of three.

41:57.448 --> 41:58.717
- Quick, let's go.

42:00.418 --> 42:01.653
- Rhino?

42:01.653 --> 42:02.487
Idiot.

42:03.722 --> 42:04.723
- I'm such an idiot.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.125
- What?

42:07.125 --> 42:09.561
- I bet Donald knows
about the second artifact.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.434
- It's over,
Rhino's almost dead.

42:16.434 --> 42:18.536
Hellinger's probably
with the feds.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.139
- Alright, get out of there
right now, I'm waiting for you.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.611
- Donald, what're
you working on?

42:27.713 --> 42:29.948
- We've been studying
this bizarre machine.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.017
They won't even tell
me where it came from.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.585
- Does it cause hallucinations?

42:33.585 --> 42:35.053
- Yeah, how did you know?

42:35.053 --> 42:38.724
- You have the second artifact,
that's what the FBI's after.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.759
- Well, then the FBI's after

42:40.759 --> 42:42.961
the most unique
device in the world.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.195
- In the world?

42:45.797 --> 42:47.532
- The hallucinations are real.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.535
This instrument breaks the rules
of physics as we know them.

42:50.535 --> 42:54.139
- What does that mean,
other dimensions?

42:54.139 --> 42:55.674
- You might say that.

42:55.674 --> 42:57.943
I call it super-reality.

42:57.943 --> 43:01.112
- What have you guys been
doing with the artifact?

43:01.112 --> 43:04.049
- With the help of big-data
analysis and reverse engineering

43:04.049 --> 43:07.819
we've been able to augment
human vision to see a layer of

43:07.819 --> 43:08.854
super-reality.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.007
- What's that?

43:29.007 --> 43:30.541
- It's a chip.

43:30.541 --> 43:34.279
Patches into your cortex with
our neuro-optical interface.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.281
- So, it connects
directly to the brain?

43:37.382 --> 43:38.283
- Yeah, basically.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.920
Don't worry, the skull
hole's pretty small,

43:41.920 --> 43:44.322
and we use precise robotics
to align everything.

43:45.556 --> 43:47.993
- Can't you guys just
build that into some

43:47.993 --> 43:50.896
sunglasses or something?

43:50.896 --> 43:53.765
- I'm just messing with you,
we totally have glasses now.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.841
Hey, you don't wanna go
full-on without training.

44:05.944 --> 44:06.778
- Whoa.

44:07.713 --> 44:10.281
- That means they're working.

44:10.281 --> 44:12.350
- That's somethin' else.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.551
- Are you okay?

44:13.551 --> 44:15.420
- Yeah, that was just
some Eldwood shit.

44:16.321 --> 44:17.155
Hold on.

44:20.625 --> 44:21.827
I can handle this.

44:24.429 --> 44:26.031
- What are you doing?

44:26.031 --> 44:27.665
- You pushed me too far.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.967
- We had a deal.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.203
- I deal from the
bottom of the deck.

44:32.203 --> 44:35.273
- I cannot allow you to
do that, hand them over.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.746
No!

44:40.746 --> 44:41.579
- Freak.

44:49.154 --> 44:49.988
- Oh, my god.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.859
- Whoa.

44:53.859 --> 44:55.126
What the hell is that?

45:02.801 --> 45:04.502
- Looks like you've
got a tentacle problem.

45:04.502 --> 45:07.505
- It looked like some kind
of super-reality link.

45:07.505 --> 45:08.974
- To the artifact?

45:08.974 --> 45:11.042
- Don't know.
- Okay.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.244
We need to borrow these.

45:13.244 --> 45:14.079
- Okay.

45:20.185 --> 45:21.853
- Where did
the artifact come from?

45:21.853 --> 45:23.221
- I don't know.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.090
- It's from my world.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.324
- Who are you?

45:26.324 --> 45:29.294
- I go by Overstreet.
- Why are you here?

45:29.294 --> 45:32.297
- You see, I'm a debugger.
- For who?

45:32.297 --> 45:35.000
- For the entities
that created the artifacts.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.868
- You're an alien
from super-reality?

45:38.837 --> 45:40.371
- You guys really
aren't gonna give up on

45:40.371 --> 45:43.341
the whole alien thing, are ya?
- Are you from another world?

45:44.776 --> 45:47.345
- Yes, I'm interfacing
through this human body

45:47.345 --> 45:49.080
to your subset of reality.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.116
- I take it you're not
here on Maskin's behalf?

45:51.116 --> 45:53.184
- No, I was trying
to deal with Maskin,

45:53.184 --> 45:55.821
but he has become
completely irrational.

45:55.821 --> 45:58.256
- It's his obsession with
the artifacts, isn't it?

45:58.256 --> 46:00.291
- Yes, he is the
most recent miscreant

46:00.291 --> 46:01.927
trying to exploit them.

46:01.927 --> 46:05.230
- Why are the artifacts
here, I mean, in our reality?

46:05.230 --> 46:07.132
- It started as an accident.

46:07.132 --> 46:10.468
That is when they called me
in, some 200 Earth-years ago.

46:10.468 --> 46:11.903
- To debug?

46:11.903 --> 46:14.039
- Yes.
- What is the bug?

46:14.039 --> 46:17.008
- That would impossible
for me to explain to you.

46:17.008 --> 46:18.543
- Try.

46:18.543 --> 46:21.379
- It starts with a machine on
our world which you might call

46:21.379 --> 46:24.082
a fabricator, it makes things.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.683
- Don't break that.

46:25.683 --> 46:28.453
- As it turns out, one
of these fabricators

46:28.453 --> 46:29.654
had a coding error.

46:31.056 --> 46:34.359
This flaw went undetected until
sections of it spontaneously

46:34.359 --> 46:36.694
dipped into your reality.

46:36.694 --> 46:38.029
- The two artifacts
are part of a

46:38.029 --> 46:39.898
single inter-dimensional
machine?

46:39.898 --> 46:42.300
- Correct, that is
why I must fix the bug

46:42.300 --> 46:45.270
before real damage is caused
to your world or mine.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.838
- Why haven't you fixed it yet?

46:46.838 --> 46:50.275
- Maskin and his predecessors
have proven quite difficult.

46:50.275 --> 46:53.211
They have discovered the
power of the artifacts.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.580
- What are humans using
the artifacts for?

46:55.580 --> 46:57.615
- There used to be
conjuring, stage magic.

46:57.615 --> 47:01.152
- What kind of stage magic?
- Manifestations of all sorts.

47:01.152 --> 47:04.890
Reality-shifting, making
objects and animals disappear.

47:04.890 --> 47:07.225
Walking through
walls and so forth.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.494
- With an alien device?

47:09.494 --> 47:12.330
That's cheating, at magic.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.865
- Cheating?

47:13.865 --> 47:16.701
- I come from a long line
of magicians and carnies.

47:16.701 --> 47:18.836
- That might
explain a few things.

47:18.836 --> 47:23.008
- Illusions are just that,
not otherworldly interloping.

47:23.008 --> 47:26.677
- Maskin is interested
in cheating, as you say,

47:26.677 --> 47:30.248
at illusions, but with
very dangerous intentions.

47:30.248 --> 47:33.084
Combining the two artifacts
wields tremendous abilities.

47:33.084 --> 47:34.652
- Time's ticking.

47:34.652 --> 47:37.989
- She is correct, Maskin's
power will grow exponentially

47:37.989 --> 47:39.690
if he connects the two
artifacts together.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.392
- How powerful?

47:41.392 --> 47:44.795
- Theoretically, he could drive
thousands of people insane,

47:44.795 --> 47:47.732
physically destroy buildings,
perhaps even a city.

47:49.000 --> 47:49.867
- Damn.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.302
- It gets worse.

47:51.302 --> 47:53.238
The artifact's error
clock has been triggered.

47:53.238 --> 47:54.872
Soon, any minute now,

47:54.872 --> 47:58.209
catastrophic
manifestations will appear.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.011
- So, where exactly is
the second artifact?

48:00.011 --> 48:01.479
- It is definitely
in this building.

48:01.479 --> 48:04.182
- I'm pretty sure it's
on the eighth floor, but,

48:04.182 --> 48:07.285
they have kept the exact location
under wraps, even from me.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.922
- Great, so all we need to do
is find the second artifact

48:10.922 --> 48:13.858
before a maniac with
manifestation abilities becomes

48:13.858 --> 48:16.361
an unstoppable wizard
without getting killed,

48:16.361 --> 48:19.730
and before the artifact
destroys everything completely.

48:19.730 --> 48:20.665
- Precisely.

48:32.643 --> 48:35.813
- Don't you have some kind of
special weapon or something?

48:35.813 --> 48:37.082
- Only this.

48:37.082 --> 48:39.951
As a debugger,
this is all I get.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.387
It links to machines
and our reality.

48:42.387 --> 48:44.122
- Can you cause manifestations?

48:44.122 --> 48:47.425
- Yes, small ones, it's not
much of a weapon, really.

48:49.127 --> 48:49.961
- Get down!

48:52.163 --> 48:53.464
Hold it, Keradin.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.200
- You okay?
- Don't let them hurt me.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.634
- Put your hands
against the wall.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.403
- I can't do that, look at this.

49:14.785 --> 49:15.720
- You're violent.

49:20.591 --> 49:22.060
- I have to leave,

49:22.060 --> 49:24.062
but there is one more thing
I should warn you about.

49:24.062 --> 49:25.396
- What?

49:25.396 --> 49:27.065
- Maskin has a
limitation in his powers.

49:27.065 --> 49:28.699
If he makes one
big manifestation,

49:28.699 --> 49:31.569
he can instantly make
another big manifestation.

49:31.569 --> 49:33.004
- How is that a limitation?

49:33.004 --> 49:35.706
- He can do this technique
exactly four times in a row and

49:35.706 --> 49:39.210
then your world will return to
normal on the fifth attempt.

49:39.210 --> 49:40.878
- I see.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.547
- I wish I had
more time to explain,

49:42.547 --> 49:43.548
but I must go now.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.657
- That reminds me of something.

49:54.059 --> 49:56.294
- Hellinger,
now is not the time.

49:57.728 --> 50:00.565
- I'm gonna show you something
that most people don't know.

50:00.565 --> 50:01.566
Standard deck.

50:04.635 --> 50:05.803
In order.

50:05.803 --> 50:08.306
Now, if I shuffle this...

50:12.710 --> 50:14.312
They are no longer in order.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.114
- Well, of course, it's
partially randomized.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.883
- Now, what would happen
if I shuffled it again?

50:18.883 --> 50:20.518
- I guess, more random?

50:20.518 --> 50:23.821
- Actually, the same
amount of randomness.

50:23.821 --> 50:25.756
- Okay, Nevil Hellinger,
street mathematician,

50:25.756 --> 50:27.258
where are you going with this?

50:28.793 --> 50:29.927
- Back in sequence.

50:31.296 --> 50:33.564
There's a very special shuffle
called a Pharaoh Shuffle

50:33.564 --> 50:37.535
in which both halves are
perfectly interleaved.

50:39.570 --> 50:40.971
- You can actually do that.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.741
- I trained for several
years on this maneuver

50:43.741 --> 50:46.144
before pivoting into thievery.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.581
- Fascinating, but
where's the trick?

50:50.581 --> 50:51.882
The cards are still random.

50:53.351 --> 50:56.987
- Guess what happens if I do
this eight times in a row?

50:56.987 --> 50:57.755
- What?

51:00.825 --> 51:03.027
- The deck is now
in the exact same order

51:03.027 --> 51:04.662
that it started.

51:04.662 --> 51:07.598
- I see, very clever.

51:07.598 --> 51:08.766
It's a cyclic function.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.314
- It's like a
series of transforms

51:23.314 --> 51:25.015
that return to the
original value.

52:03.754 --> 52:04.989
- Are you okay?

52:06.557 --> 52:09.327
- I'm getting more visual
data from the artifact.

52:09.327 --> 52:10.795
Do you have a pen?

52:12.397 --> 52:14.399
You stole one of our pens?

52:14.399 --> 52:15.566
- They're free.

52:19.470 --> 52:22.207
- I'm learning the
commands from the artifact.

52:27.077 --> 52:29.347
- Well, that's fantastic.

52:29.347 --> 52:31.549
But we don't have time for this.

52:31.549 --> 52:32.883
- When the super-reality
links with my brain,

52:32.883 --> 52:36.421
it's the only advantage
we have over Maskin.

52:36.421 --> 52:37.255
- Uh-oh.

52:39.924 --> 52:40.825
- I'm not sure I
noticed that, though.

52:43.328 --> 52:44.729
It's fractal.

52:44.729 --> 52:45.530
- There's something
I need to show you.

52:45.530 --> 52:46.997
- Over there, Keradin.

52:46.997 --> 52:51.101
Hold tight, let me try
and figure this out.

52:51.101 --> 52:52.970
What is this?

53:04.148 --> 53:05.350
- Hold it, Maskin.

53:05.350 --> 53:07.652
- Keradin, have you
come to your senses yet?

53:07.652 --> 53:09.220
- What on earth are you doing?

53:10.120 --> 53:11.389
- Getting ready for the show.

53:11.389 --> 53:13.591
- And are you planning
a grand illusion?

53:13.591 --> 53:16.126
- Oh, I'm done with illusions.

53:16.126 --> 53:19.264
I will control reality itself.

53:19.264 --> 53:22.132
- I suppose you think
you know what reality is?

53:22.132 --> 53:25.636
- Everybody's running around
like primates, but not me.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.672
The artifact has
extended my reach.

53:29.507 --> 53:32.243
And I have seen true existence.

53:32.243 --> 53:35.079
- We only know reality through
our mental constructions.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.648
The outside world
is inside your head,

53:37.648 --> 53:38.816
even with the artifact.

53:39.884 --> 53:41.218
- A depressing assessment.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.555
- As much as I'd love to
wax philosophic with you,

53:44.555 --> 53:45.756
it's hardly the time.

53:48.259 --> 53:51.095
- Quite so, it's time
for the main attraction.

53:52.663 --> 53:54.499
- You're a chuck-up
from the neck up.

53:57.668 --> 53:58.969
- You can't stop me.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.907
- No!
- What the...

54:03.741 --> 54:04.575
- Maskin!

54:19.657 --> 54:20.658
There he is.

54:38.075 --> 54:40.110
- I hope this isn't
another deception.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.746
- Wait, what?

54:41.746 --> 54:43.814
- Since Maskin's into illusions.

54:43.814 --> 54:46.050
- Shit, it's the oldest
trick in the book.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.685
- He wanted us out
of the building.

54:47.685 --> 54:50.154
- The only reason to
dress like a clown

54:50.154 --> 54:53.358
is because there's two clowns.

54:53.358 --> 54:56.193
- Maskin forced us to
follow the double out here,

54:56.193 --> 54:58.763
while he's still in
the research facility.

54:59.897 --> 55:00.698
- Finally.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.505
- I can't get into
this armored door shit.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.807
- And the front entrance
is locked down, too.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.275
- I had some tools.

55:12.943 --> 55:16.647
But, uh, my driver Lorrie
seems to have taken the car.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.716
- What about the FBI van?

55:21.586 --> 55:23.521
- This requires
fed fingerprints.

55:23.521 --> 55:24.989
- I thought you were a thief?

55:24.989 --> 55:27.792
- My thievery requires planning.

55:43.641 --> 55:44.575
Find anything?

55:53.283 --> 55:54.619
- What the hell?

55:56.654 --> 55:58.789
- Go check out the entrances.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.491
I have work to do.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.098
- Don't move!

56:08.098 --> 56:09.934
- Ulrich, I don't know
what Maskin told you,

56:09.934 --> 56:11.469
but he's unhinged.

56:11.469 --> 56:13.438
- This is your last
chance, Keradin.

56:14.605 --> 56:15.540
- Can we go in the
other direction?

56:15.540 --> 56:16.974
- No, we have to go this way.

56:26.016 --> 56:28.719
Well, looks like we need to
try another set of stairs.

56:31.822 --> 56:33.791
- How did a nice
gunfighter like you end up

56:33.791 --> 56:36.661
in a research
facility like this?

56:36.661 --> 56:39.396
- It was my dream before
this whole FBI thing.

56:39.396 --> 56:40.865
- A dream?

56:40.865 --> 56:44.001
- As a kid, I was fascinated
by all the branches of science.

56:44.001 --> 56:46.804
Conducting experiments,
lighting things on fire.

56:46.804 --> 56:48.238
- Natural-born scientist.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.475
- Yes, and at 18 I
renounced religion.

56:50.475 --> 56:51.942
- Never tried it myself.

56:51.942 --> 56:54.344
- It affects people's
view of the entire world.

56:54.344 --> 56:55.780
- But you didn't buy it.

56:55.780 --> 56:58.282
- No, my parents bought
Bibles, but I burned them all.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.019
- Well, they
must have loved that.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.658
- You said you have
something to tell me?

57:09.494 --> 57:12.062
- Uh, I stole
Overstreet's watch.

57:12.062 --> 57:13.063
- You have no shame.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.332
- It's just so easy.

57:17.568 --> 57:18.736
- But perhaps useful.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.172
- I can't make
heads or tails of it.

57:23.608 --> 57:24.742
- I think I'm
starting to understand

57:24.742 --> 57:26.577
these alien symbols now.

57:26.577 --> 57:28.445
- Can you actually
make stuff happen?

57:30.180 --> 57:30.981
- We need to go.

57:36.053 --> 57:36.887
- Thought you stopped
me, didn't you?

57:36.887 --> 57:39.056
- Ulrich, don't you see?

57:39.056 --> 57:42.627
Maskin is a murderer, he's
obsessed with the artifact

57:42.627 --> 57:44.128
and will kill
anybody in his way.

57:44.128 --> 57:46.831
- You're the one running around
with the professional thief,

57:46.831 --> 57:48.298
shooting Federal agents.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.935
- I have no choice, we
have to stop Maskin.

57:50.935 --> 57:52.770
He's planning
something sinister.

57:52.770 --> 57:54.404
- Sure he is.

57:54.404 --> 57:56.907
- The artifact can manifest
and change reality,

57:56.907 --> 57:58.609
at least as we know it.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.511
- Change reality?

58:00.511 --> 58:02.547
- They can literally
manifest objects.

58:02.547 --> 58:05.683
- Literally-literally or
literally-figuratively?

58:05.683 --> 58:06.984
- Literally-literally.

58:08.853 --> 58:12.222
- Spooky and stupid, you
should be ashamed of yourself.

58:12.222 --> 58:14.024
- You really think
Maskin is just leading

58:14.024 --> 58:15.626
a routine job here?

58:15.626 --> 58:17.061
- He hasn't been
by the book, but--

58:17.061 --> 58:19.830
- Look, he killed Thorndike.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.465
I saw it with my lab camera.

58:21.465 --> 58:24.501
Maskin attacked him and
I saw the recording.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.871
- Alright, let's say
Maskin is deranged,

58:26.871 --> 58:28.472
what exactly do you plan to do?

58:28.472 --> 58:30.875
- I need to get to the second
artifact before Maskin does.

58:30.875 --> 58:31.909
- What about him?

58:31.909 --> 58:33.544
He's a thief.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.580
- There is a time factor here.

58:35.580 --> 58:38.082
- He's right, the artifact could
go critical any second now.

58:38.082 --> 58:39.750
- How do you know this?

58:39.750 --> 58:42.319
- Let's stop this crazy
person first, then debrief.

58:43.220 --> 58:44.321
- You better be right.

58:52.897 --> 58:56.801
- So, what kind of
deal did you make with

58:56.801 --> 58:58.969
Nevil "The Devil"
Hellinger here?

58:58.969 --> 59:00.470
Split the profits 50-50?

59:01.639 --> 59:03.140
- I didn't make a
deal with Hellinger.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.209
- Then why are you even here?

59:05.209 --> 59:06.744
- The artifact needs
to be researched,

59:06.744 --> 59:09.246
and you need to go back
to the authorities.

59:09.246 --> 59:10.648
- I am the authorities.

59:12.016 --> 59:14.184
- I bet the bureau doesn't
even know about the operations.

59:14.184 --> 59:16.353
Do they?
- Ulrich, seize them.

59:18.889 --> 59:19.957
- No can do.

59:21.158 --> 59:23.661
- You are disobeying
an order, agent.

59:23.661 --> 59:27.097
- You're getting the
wrong people killed.

59:51.055 --> 59:52.056
- Kill them.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:34.999
Yes.

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:45.309
- Ulrich.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:51.281
Maskin, you asshole.

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.884
- The artifact
is complete once again,

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:54.819
and it's mine.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:58.689
You have already lost, Keradin.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.892
You're free to go, just
walk through the exit.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:02.693
- What exit?

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.273
- Can you get rid
of this obstruction?

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.342
- I can try but Maskin
is too powerful now.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.881
- What about the alien watch?

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:02.519
- I could make a new
manifestation, but I'd probably

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:04.254
end up getting us killed.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.956
- Yeah,
let's not do that.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:08.458
- Maybe I should quit.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.328
It seems that's all I'm good
at these days, quitting.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:14.064
- It's not really quitting.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:14.899
- Please.

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:21.038
- My great-grandfather,
Selbit Hellinger,

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:24.108
sailed ships before
he became a carnie.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.877
He also invented the
cutting-a-woman-in-half trick.

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.414
- Is that true?

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.216
- Well, he was a liar
and a horse thief,

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:33.650
but that's besides the point.

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:37.287
- What does your eccentric
ancestor have to do

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.323
with my abysmal failure?

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:42.159
- Well, he would have called
it "a course correction."

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.161
- A euphemism?
- A metaphor.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.596
- Failing is failing,
quitting is quitting.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.198
- Depends on how you look at it.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:56.140
- You're right.
- I usually am.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:58.508
- About perception.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:00.945
- I didn't say
anything about perception.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:03.948
- How one can look at
something can be advantage.

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:05.816
- Look, I'm all
for finishing this,

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.717
but we can't get to Maskin.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:10.487
We have nothing to
fight him with anyway.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.289
- I still have my mental links.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.292
- And you've got
the alien watch.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:18.095
- We can out-conjure
the conjurer.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:20.630
- You're starting to sound
nuttier than old Selbit.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.632
- It's just a sleight of hand.

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.003
- Well done, but
your plan is absurd.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:29.173
- Thank you for your support.

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:31.942
- You're welcome, I
usually charge for therapy,

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.677
but I'll give you a discount.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.350
- Help me with this.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.256
- Why aren't you in
link yet, Keradin?

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:18.956
- Ready?

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:26.430
Hand over the artifact.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.101
- You drooling
philistines don't deserve

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:35.439
to behold the artifact,
let alone hold it.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.377
How do you like that trick?

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:54.224
- Let's make a deal.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.692
- What kind of deal?

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.894
- You get the artifact,
but you let me research it.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.064
- Please, something so radical?

01:05:00.064 --> 01:05:02.432
You publish your research
and before you know it,

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.201
society comes unglued.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.036
- So you propose
we keep it hidden?

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.472
- So you think I'm
here on a power trip.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.908
I think of it more as
a service to humankind.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.611
- Keeping people in the
dark is not a service.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:16.413
You're just trying
to protect yourself.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.149
- People don't
want brute sanity!

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:26.356
Say goodbye to sanity.

01:05:58.255 --> 01:05:59.256
- Hellinger!

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:35.192
- He can do this technique
exactly four times in a row and

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:38.462
then your world will return to
normal on the fifth attempt.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.629
- That's two.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.999
- Think you're in
control, Keradin?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.135
I'm running this show.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.970
- We'll see about that.

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:49.573
- You're just an
amateur at this game.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:40.524
- Maskin?

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.762
Is this another trick, Maskin?

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.233
- Are you
alright, Keradin?

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:50.934
We are very worried about you.

01:07:52.136 --> 01:07:54.304
- Who's "we?"
- Me and the atrifact.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.573
I know this is cruel,
but I need your link.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.176
- Link, interface...

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.078
This is number three.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.917
- Trying
to blow yourself up?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.054
Relax, just wait a
few more seconds.

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:18.828
Impossible.

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:39.616
- This is four.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.885
- Give up your
link to the artifact.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:28.064
Give up.

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:30.399
Ow.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:59.696
Give up.

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:03.267
Give up.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.170
Give up.
- Give up.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.806
- Give up.
- Give up.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.294
No!

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:33.763
My power is gone.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:38.768
- I'm not armed.

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.838
- Put your hands
behind your head.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.711
- There's something you should
have learned about reality.

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:49.379
- What's that?

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:51.180
- We only know it
through interfaces.

01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:20.844
Hellinger?

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:22.746
Are you alive?

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.080
- Seems like it.

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:31.555
What did I miss?

01:11:31.555 --> 01:11:33.657
- Maskin is dead and the
artifact has returned

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:35.492
to its rightful owner.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:39.028
- Where did
Overstreet's body go?

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.397
- I don't know, I think
she got sucked back

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:41.765
into the world she came from.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.003
- Guess I'm not gonna
make any money after all.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.272
- Maybe time you had a
course-correction in your career.

01:11:49.272 --> 01:11:51.274
- Well, maybe.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:55.579
- Give it back.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:38.455
- Oh, I forgot to ask.
- What is it?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.226
- Are those super-reality
interfaces still

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.294
stuck in your brain?
- I don't know.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.131
Even if they were,
the links are dead,

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:50.299
and the artifact is deactivated.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.669
- What if they fix it
and turn it back online?

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:57.574
- Well, I guess we'll
just wait and see.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.277
Hellinger, do
thieves often pretend

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:02.579
to be someone they're not?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.451
- What're you tryin' to tell me?

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:08.952
- I thinking about Overstreet.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:12.422
- She said she was an
otherworldly debugger.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:14.390
- But how do we
know that's true?

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.960
- Overstreet, a grifter?

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.362
- Don't let them hurt me.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.831
- It was all a confidence trick.

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:23.366
- We get Maskin out of the way,

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:25.935
and Overstreet programs the
artifact to transport itself

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.304
to some hideaway where
she gets it later.

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.908
- Overstreet's dead.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.410
- Maybe not, if she's
really an alien.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.945
- Or a deception.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.748
- Overstreet could still be
alive in the super-reality.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.150
- She could probably create
any number of human bodies

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.185
in our world.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.643
- What if she's coming after us?

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:08.678
- Us?

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:11.047
I have nothing to do with this.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:12.849
- Well, there's
no use in worrying

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:14.484
about a paranoid hypothesis.
