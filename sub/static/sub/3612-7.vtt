WEBVTT

00:09.886 --> 00:11.251
Son of a bitch!

00:23.357 --> 00:26.144
Jin. Come on.
Wake up, buddy. Wake up.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.068
Sawyer.

00:31.324 --> 00:34.407
- How long have I been out?
- A while.

00:34.493 --> 00:38.862
- Figured you could use the rest.
- Claire and Locke... Where are they?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.947
I don't know. They said
they'd be back by sunup.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.953
We have to get out
before they come back.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.535
Easy. Whoa, whoa. I'm with Locke.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.341
That is not Locke.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.174
Yeah, I know.

00:52.261 --> 00:55.628
Whoever he is, he says
he can get us off this damn island.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.765
lcantleave.
Sun could be here somewhere.

01:01.687 --> 01:06.351
Fine. If she's here, you got my word.
We ain't leaving without her.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.939
- What's that?
- They're back.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.342
Hi.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.432
Hi yourself.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.694
Wow.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.291
Jimmy...

02:06.168 --> 02:10.878
You are... unbelievable.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.874
You're not too shabby
yourself, sweetheart.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.878
- Baby?
- Yeah?

02:18.973 --> 02:21.134
Weren't you supposed
to meet that guy at 9:00?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.635
Yeah. So?

02:23.728 --> 02:26.561
lt's eight... Forty-two.

02:28.691 --> 02:29.897
Damn it!

02:42.121 --> 02:44.328
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.076
What are you doing with all that money?

02:47.209 --> 02:50.622
This meeting is a potential investment.
We're going 50/50.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.416
The guy wants to see the money upfront.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.874
Don't worry. It won't take long.
I'll be right back.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.630
Me and you'll go for round...

02:59.889 --> 03:01.254
Step away from the case.

03:03.142 --> 03:06.179
- Take it easy, honey.
- Here's the thing, Dimples.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.556
I can spot a con man.
I'm married to one.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.933
So I know all about the pigeon drop.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.392
Oh, what? That case
just accidentally flew open?

03:14.487 --> 03:19.481
- How stupid do you think I am?
- Pretty damn stupid, actually.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.114
- Excuse me?
- This is a setup, lady.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.321
There's a van sittin' right outside.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.077
The room is bugged.
The place is surrounded by cops.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.877
So now you wanna put that gun down,
and we'll work something out.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.705
They don't care about you.
They want your husband.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.382
There's a tracer in the case.
All you had to do

03:38.469 --> 03:41.006
was take it back to wherever
your hubby's hiding out.

03:41.931 --> 03:45.219
You really except me to believe
that you're working with the police?

03:45.309 --> 03:48.847
lfthis place is surrounded,
how come no one came to save you?

03:48.938 --> 03:50.599
I don't need saving...

03:51.023 --> 03:54.015
...'cause you're gonna do the
right thing, and put that gun down.

03:55.152 --> 03:59.065
But if you don't, well, then all
I gotta do is say the magic word,

03:59.156 --> 04:03.695
- and that door busts open.
- You're a lousy con man.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.537
- LaFleur.
- "La" what?

04:08.916 --> 04:09.951
Police! Drop the gun!

04:13.879 --> 04:15.494
Behind your back.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.205
- Cuttin' it a little close, huh?
- Only way to cut it.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.254
- Put your damn clothes on, Jim.
- You got it, partner.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.839
- You're a cop?
- Surprise.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.174
Let's go. Move.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.233
Is this where you lived?

05:21.864 --> 05:23.104
Yeah.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.233
What is that?

05:31.624 --> 05:33.080
It's all I had.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.663
All right, everybody, listen up!
Come on in. Gather around.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.085
I know that everyone is tired.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.930
It was a... a long and
traumatic night for all of us.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.184
And you all have got
a lot ofquestions, I know,

05:54.271 --> 05:56.683
and I will make myself
available to answer them.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.851
But right now we need to keep moving.
Have to take advantage of the daylight.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.276
We wanna know what happened

06:02.363 --> 06:04.775
to the people who
stayed behind at the temple.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.528
The black smoke killed them.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.824
Hey.

06:18.587 --> 06:22.330
I know that what happened
back there was really scary.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.009
But it's over.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.464
You're with me now, and I promise
that I'm gonna take care of you.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.439
OK? All right, let's move out.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.613
Sounds like you had a hell of a night.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.158
- Yeah.
- Jack, Hurley, the rest of 'em...

06:59.253 --> 07:01.369
They make it out
of the temple all right?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.169
I saw them leaving on my way back.

07:04.008 --> 07:08.126
- What about Miles?
- I don't know what happened to him.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.971
So you're with Locke now?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.468
I ain't with anybody, Kate.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.308
Hello. Is this Anthony Cooper?

07:25.112 --> 07:28.445
Hi, Mr. Cooper. This is
detective James Ford, LAPD.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.774
Yeah, we've discovered some unclaimed
property that might belong to you.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.360
Can you verify
you were in Alabama in 1976?

07:37.750 --> 07:40.537
OK, thanks. Sorry to have
taken up your time. Bye-bye.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.177
- Can I speak with Anthony Cooper?
- ...still holding for you.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.129
Sorry. I'm gonna have to call you back.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.262
Who's Anthony Cooper?

07:59.647 --> 08:02.980
Old buddy I ran into. Said he could
hook me up with some Laker tickets.

08:03.067 --> 08:06.651
That's cool. What, did you...
you see him in Palm Springs?

08:06.737 --> 08:10.946
- What?
- Palm Springs? Your trip last weekend?

08:11.033 --> 08:13.399
Yeah. It's a blur.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.531
Too much sunshine.
Too many mai tais.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.659
Well, get it together,
because you got a date tonight, pal.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.074
Date with who?

08:22.169 --> 08:25.377
Friend of mine, works with
my dad at the museum. She's great.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.422
Well, if she's so great,
why don't you go out with her?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.922
Hey, I got a girlfriend.
What is your deal, Jim?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.549
Do you wanna die alone?

08:35.766 --> 08:38.052
Look, | go out with her,
you gonna leave me alone?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.759
Throw in one of those
Laker tickets, hell, yes, lwill.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.723
Look, I'm already
pulling strings with this guy.

08:45.818 --> 08:49.481
lt'sjust... I don't know
if I can get another seat.

08:58.122 --> 09:01.785
- Are you lying to me, man?
- Why the hell would I lie?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.857
About a quarter mile ahead,
there's a clearing.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.728
We'll make camp there.
Everybody fill up on water.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.686
- We might be there a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.905
I thought you said
we were gettin' off this rock.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.445
- We are.
- When?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.824
Maybe we should
talk about this in private?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.451
Great. Let's go.

09:47.337 --> 09:51.706
- | wish you hadn't interrupted me.
- I'm sorry. I forgot my manners.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.840
- I forgive ya.
- What happened back at the temple?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.763
How'd you know to rescue everybody
from that smoke thing?

10:00.976 --> 10:02.557
I didn't rescue them.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.351
I'm the smoke thing.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.688
You telling me
you killed all those people?

10:15.783 --> 10:18.616
I gave them the opportunity
to leave peacefully,

10:18.702 --> 10:21.444
- and they didn't take it.
- Why not?

10:21.538 --> 10:24.701
Because they're convinced that
they're protecting the island from me,

10:24.792 --> 10:27.204
when, in fact, all I wanna do is leave.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.543
So it's either kill or be killed.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.211
And I don't want to be killed.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.185
- We goin' on a boat ride?
- You are.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.237
- Where?
- Hydra island.

10:58.492 --> 11:03.077
- What's on Hydra island?
- The plane. The Ajira flight.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.404
The same plane that
brought your friends back.

11:05.499 --> 11:09.333
Unfortunately, they didn't come alone.
And l have reason to believe

11:09.419 --> 11:12.331
that some of the other passengers
mean to do us all harm.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.880
So I want you to go over there
and do some recon.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.967
- Well, that sounds safe.
- You'll be fine.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.669
Yeah?

11:20.764 --> 11:23.972
What am I supposed to do ifl run
into somebody who wants to do me harm?

11:24.059 --> 11:27.096
- I'm not worried about that.
- Oh, you're not, huh?

11:27.187 --> 11:31.180
No, because you are
the best liar I ever met.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.727
Tell 'em whatever you need
to tell 'em to gain their trust,

11:35.821 --> 11:38.904
find out everything you can about them,
and then get back here.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.486
Why exactly am I doing this again?

11:43.579 --> 11:45.535
Why do you think, James?

11:45.622 --> 11:50.161
We get on that plane, we fly off
this island, and we never look back.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.126
Come on.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.020
- Yeah?
- Miles,

12:19.114 --> 12:20.945
what's this girl look like again?

12:21.033 --> 12:23.820
She's a redhead. How many...
How many redheads do you see?

12:25.621 --> 12:26.656
Roger that.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.237
- Be nice to her...
- Yeah, yeah.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.044
Excuse me.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.295
- Would you be Charlotte?
- | most certainly am.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.465
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.090
Thank you.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.099
Archaeology, huh?

12:53.190 --> 12:56.648
- What's wrong with archaeology?
- Nothin'.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.319
| just figured you'd be stuck in
a room somewhere dusting off antiques.

13:01.198 --> 13:06.659
No, I actually get to travel quite
a bit, to far off and romantic places.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.451
Really?

13:08.538 --> 13:11.154
What, you like an Indiana Jones
or somethin'?

13:11.249 --> 13:14.491
Yes. I'm exactly like Indiana Jones.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.790
- You got a whip?
- Maybe.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.382
So what about you?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.757
- What about me?
- Why did you become a cop?

13:25.847 --> 13:27.098
You ever seen Bul/itt?

13:27.182 --> 13:29.389
- Steve McQueen flick.
- No.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.139
Well, then I won't even
bore you with an explanation.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.479
OK, do me a favor, James,
and don't treat me like

13:36.566 --> 13:38.477
all the other girls that ask you.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.731
Tell me the truth.

13:47.953 --> 13:52.947
Well... I guess I...
got to a point in my life

13:53.041 --> 13:56.829
where l was either gonna
become a criminal or a cop.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.578
So I chose cop.

14:05.929 --> 14:06.964
What?

14:08.306 --> 14:09.762
You know what.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.949
Well, not bad, considering
we didn't have that whip.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.406
Bring it next time.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.955
- You want some water?
- Yes, please.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.089
- You mind if I borrow a T-shirt?
- Help yourself.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.671
- Top drawer on the right.
- Thanks.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.626
- What the hell are you doing?
- l was just looking for a T-shirt.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.762
- What did you see?
- Nothing, just that you had...

15:32.849 --> 15:34.589
That picture fell out.
l was trying to put it back.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.673
What did you see?!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.634
- Nothing! I didn't see anything.
- Get the hell out.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.640
- James, just let me explain.
- Get out!

17:05.066 --> 17:08.103
- Hey.
- Kate.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.527
- Do you believe Locke?
- What do you mean?

17:14.618 --> 17:20.033
- That he can get us off the island.
- Yes, I believe him.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.081
Sayid, are you all right?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.535
No.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.838
Claire!

17:35.472 --> 17:38.384
Sayid! Sayid, please! St...

17:44.981 --> 17:46.141
What are you doing?!

17:46.983 --> 17:49.850
- She took him! She took Aaron!
- Claire, you had disappeared.

17:49.945 --> 17:52.152
Kate couldn't find you.
She did what she had to do.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.321
She took Aaron!
She can'tjust do that!

17:59.037 --> 18:02.404
This is completely inappropriate.
All right?

18:02.499 --> 18:06.367
Now... you go over there.
I'll deal with you in a minute.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.499
Go.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.002
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

20:18.551 --> 20:19.802
Hey! Stop!

20:28.019 --> 20:29.099
- No!
- Don't move!

20:29.187 --> 20:30.597
Please don't hurt me!

20:32.482 --> 20:33.642
Who the hell are you?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.977
I'm the only one left.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.704
Excuse me, sir?
I asked you about my brother.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.998
I told you.
I'll be with you in a minute.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.251
Hey, I'm looking for my brother.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.799
He was arrested at
the airport on a drug charge.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.751
Sorry. Not my department.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.929
- Mornin', sunshine.
- Come with me.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.432
- Shut up!
- What the hell is your...

21:13.523 --> 21:15.684
- There something you wanna tell me?
- What?!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.481
There something you wanna tell me?

21:20.947 --> 21:24.314
- She opened the wrong drawer.
- What are you talking about?

21:25.535 --> 21:28.072
I wanna know what
you were doing in Australia

21:28.163 --> 21:30.199
when you told me
you were in Palm Springs.

21:31.207 --> 21:34.199
I ran your credit card.
I know you went to Sydney.

21:34.294 --> 21:39.004
Oceanic. Round trip.
You took flight 815 back two days ago.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.797
- What're you doin' running my card?
- You lied to me!

21:43.470 --> 21:45.506
We're supposed to trust each other.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.765
So, Jim... what were
you doing in Australia?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.766
That's none of your damn business.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.901
You know what? You're right...

22:07.160 --> 22:09.242
...because I'm not your partner anymore.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.596
- You thirsty?
- Very.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.508
l'm Sawyer.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.809
l'm Zoe. I can't believe
there's anybody left alive.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.609
- Thought I knew everybody on the plane.
- I didn't come on this plane.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.528
- What plane did you come on?
- Long story.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.990
What the hell happened here?
What killed all those people?

22:50.203 --> 22:52.945
I... We... We crashed here,

22:53.039 --> 22:56.497
and we were all just waiting for...

22:57.168 --> 23:01.707
...someone to rescue us.
l was out collecting wood

23:01.798 --> 23:05.507
when I heard... screaming.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.634
Screaming?

23:11.391 --> 23:12.722
When I came back...

23:16.396 --> 23:19.012
They were... They were all dead.

23:21.401 --> 23:25.064
I spent the last two days
dragging their bodies up here.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.565
I didn't feel it was right to
leave them out there in the sun.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.657
Are you alone?

23:38.835 --> 23:41.668
No. I'm with a group of people
back on the main island.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.541
- I can take you back there.
- Oh, thank God.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.750
Trust me, God's got
nothing to do with it.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.568
I'm sorry, Kate.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.902
Excuse me?

24:12.994 --> 24:15.986
l have to take responsibility
for Claire's behavior.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.117
l was the one who told her
that the Others had her baby.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.583
Why would you tell her that?

24:26.883 --> 24:29.795
Have you ever had an enemy?

24:31.012 --> 24:33.094
Someone that you needed to hate?

24:34.932 --> 24:36.797
Very powerful, isn't it?

24:38.144 --> 24:40.760
Claire was devastated without Aaron.

24:40.855 --> 24:45.565
She needed something to...
Something to keep her going, so...

24:46.152 --> 24:48.359
I gave her something to hate.

24:50.657 --> 24:54.275
And then when you told her the truth,
all those feelings, all that anger

24:54.369 --> 24:56.906
that she'd been
holding on to for so long...

24:56.996 --> 24:58.577
It had to go somewhere.

24:59.165 --> 25:03.625
Very insightful...
coming from a dead man.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.170
Well, nobody's perfect.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.217
I'm sorry that this happened.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.387
And I'm sure, if you give her time,
everything will be all right.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.305
I promised before that
I would keep everyone safe,

25:21.396 --> 25:22.932
and that means you, too, Kate.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.813
Where did Sawyer go?

25:34.283 --> 25:35.784
I'll show you.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.047
Think that thing'll still fly?

25:52.135 --> 25:56.048
I don't know. It'll take a bit of work
and someone who knows how to do it.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.221
I take it you haven't
come across the pilot?

25:58.307 --> 25:59.592
No, ma'am.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.592
How many people
did you say were with you?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.723
Couple dozen.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.306
Did they all come
on the same plane as you?

26:08.401 --> 26:09.607
Some, not all.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.776
When did you crash?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.358
Long time ago.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.323
Do you all have guns?

26:18.411 --> 26:23.075
I mean, whoever killed those people back
there, they... they might come back.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.365
Yeah, we got plenty of guns.

26:26.461 --> 26:30.955
You wanna grab that end?
Where'd you say you were headed?

26:31.048 --> 26:34.006
- What's that?
- Your flight. Where were you going?

26:35.845 --> 26:38.712
- Guam.
- What's in Guam?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.421
My boyfriend.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.223
You're good, sweetheart,
but you ain't that good.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.181
- What are you talking about?
- Who are you?

26:56.073 --> 26:57.734
Put your weapon down!

27:00.536 --> 27:01.616
Drop it now!

27:04.999 --> 27:08.742
- Your name even Zoe?
- ls yours Sawyer?

27:11.088 --> 27:14.376
- Down on your knees!
- All right, all right. You got me.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.839
Take me to your leader.

27:39.951 --> 27:43.068
That island over there,
that's where I sent Sawyer.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.825
You could've told me that
you sent him to the island

27:46.916 --> 27:49.828
where we were locked in cages.
You didn't have to bring me here.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.456
Sure, but then I wouldn't
have gotten to talk to you.

27:54.966 --> 27:59.426
You referred to me as a dead man.
I am not a dead man.

28:00.596 --> 28:05.886
I know what you're feeling, Kate.
I know what you're going through.

28:05.977 --> 28:08.764
- How do you know that?
- Because...

28:13.526 --> 28:16.939
...my mother was crazy.

28:20.908 --> 28:25.572
A long time ago, before I...
looked... like this,

28:25.663 --> 28:30.623
I had a mother, just like everyone.
She was a very disturbed woman.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.994
And as a result of that...

28:36.799 --> 28:38.790
...I had some growing pains...

28:41.929 --> 28:44.671
Problems that I'm still
trying to work my way through.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.511
Problems that...

28:49.979 --> 28:54.188
...could have been avoided,
had things been different.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.901
Why are you telling me this?

29:02.992 --> 29:06.655
Because now... Aaron...

29:08.497 --> 29:10.988
...has a crazy mother, too.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.961
Get in. He's waiting for you.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.873
It's not me I'm worried about.

30:36.961 --> 30:40.419
/ just don't know what I'd do if
anything ever happened to you or Ma.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.841
Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us.
Not today, anyway.

30:47.013 --> 30:50.050
It's the way you live this life,
each day, one at a time.

30:51.267 --> 30:54.304
If you spend your whole life worrying
about something that's gonna happen,

30:54.395 --> 30:58.104
before you know it, life 's over and
you spent an awful lot of it worrying.

30:59.316 --> 31:03.855
Hey, you hear that?
That's what life's all about...

31:05.031 --> 31:07.363
Laughing and loving each other...

31:08.200 --> 31:11.033
...and knowing that people
aren't really gone when they die.

31:12.580 --> 31:17.244
We have all the good memories
to sustain us until we see 'em again.

31:17.334 --> 31:21.543
- It's hard not being afraid, Pa.
- I know, sweetheart.

31:22.590 --> 31:23.830
I know.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.638
You've got to be joking.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.069
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.893
- Why not?
- You don't get to kick me out

31:45.988 --> 31:48.274
at 3:00 in the morning,
then come 'round the next day

31:48.365 --> 31:51.357
with puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.949
Look, I don't know if you're just
lonely or guilty or completely mad.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.909
But you know what?
I don't care. You blew it.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.624
- What you got in here?
- None of your business. Keep moving.

32:55.766 --> 32:56.755
Come.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.559
- He's here, sir.
- Thanks, Zoe.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.569
- Would you leave us, please?
- Of course.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.205
Hello, Mr. Ford.
My name is Charles Widmore.

33:26.589 --> 33:29.626
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course I do.

33:29.717 --> 33:33.585
You're the fella sent a freighter to the
island loaded with guys to kill us all.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.134
It's sad, really...

33:39.768 --> 33:41.508
...how little you actually know.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.970
Well, I know you murdered
all them people out there

33:44.064 --> 33:46.897
- and dropped 'em in a ditch.
- We didn't murder those people.

33:46.984 --> 33:50.568
- I don't expect you to believe that.
- Good. I don't.

33:52.615 --> 33:55.652
So why don't you tell me
what brought you over to this island?

33:57.119 --> 33:58.234
John Locke sent me.

34:00.748 --> 34:01.988
John Locke's dead.

34:02.082 --> 34:05.825
I think we both know the guy
I'm talking about is not really Locke.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.211
So here's the deal, Chief.

34:14.595 --> 34:17.086
I'll go back over there
and tell him the coast is clear,

34:17.181 --> 34:18.466
that I didn't find anybody.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.641
Then I'll bring the old man
right to your doorstep.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.977
Then you can kill him.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.696
And what do you want
in exchange, James?

34:37.910 --> 34:41.869
One, the people I come back with,
the people on my boat,

34:41.956 --> 34:45.289
don't get touched,
not even a hair on their head.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.367
And two...

34:48.087 --> 34:50.499
...you give us safe passage
off the island.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.083
How do I know I can trust you?

34:56.553 --> 34:58.885
Same way I know I can trust you.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.054
So...

35:07.856 --> 35:09.983
...do we have an agreement?

35:22.705 --> 35:24.320
I suppose we do.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.924
Kate.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.471
| just...

35:45.477 --> 35:47.889
| just wanna say I'm sorry.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.104
I don't know why I did that.

35:51.191 --> 35:53.978
I know everything you did was just
'cause you care about me,

35:54.069 --> 35:55.934
and about Aaron.

35:59.658 --> 36:04.152
Thank you.
Thank you for taking care of him.

36:09.877 --> 36:13.665
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.667
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

36:21.096 --> 36:25.089
It's OK. It's OK.

36:32.441 --> 36:33.772
How'd it go?

36:34.485 --> 36:36.225
You didn't really send me over there

36:36.320 --> 36:38.481
to find passengers
from that plane, did you?

36:41.492 --> 36:42.481
No.

36:45.162 --> 36:48.996
Well, in case you're interested,
they're all dead.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.161
Well, that's terrible.
What happened?

36:53.796 --> 36:56.333
- I don't know.
- Well, what do you know, James?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.417
I know there's a man
over there on that island

37:01.512 --> 37:04.128
that ain't gonna let us get
on that plane without a fight.

37:04.223 --> 37:08.136
Came over on a sub.
Name's Widmore.

37:09.103 --> 37:12.891
- Charles Widmore?
- Well, I guess y'all know each other.

37:13.941 --> 37:17.729
He ain't alone. I counted at least
six armed compadres with him,

37:17.820 --> 37:20.061
not to mention
whatever crew's on that sub.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.522
There's a locked room on there...
somethin' they're hiding.

37:23.617 --> 37:27.155
And they're settin' up pylons,
like the ones at new Otherton.

37:27.830 --> 37:31.322
You know... the ones that
keep out that smoke thing.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.835
And what did you tell them about me?

37:40.968 --> 37:45.803
I told them I'd tell you the coast
was clear and bring you back with me.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.504
Walk you right into their trap.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.342
That way, they could kill you...

37:52.479 --> 37:55.437
Which means they'll be
caught with their pants down

37:55.524 --> 37:57.731
when we change our plan of attack.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.944
I appreciate your loyalty, James.

38:06.076 --> 38:08.533
You said you were gonna
get me off this island.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.990
Deal's a deal.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.715
- What are you doing here?
- Get in the car.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.402
Who's Sawyer?

38:58.045 --> 39:00.331
When I was nine years old,

39:00.422 --> 39:04.506
my father shot my mother,
and then he killed himself.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.596
Sawyer was the reason why.

39:12.935 --> 39:15.426
He was a grifter. Con man.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.269
I've been hunting him down
since the day I left the Academy.

39:28.408 --> 39:33.448
I chased down a lead in Australia,
got a name, Anthony Cooper.

39:33.539 --> 39:38.374
I ran the name. I got a list of Anthony
Coopers, and I've been calling them.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.412
And when | find the right one...

39:46.134 --> 39:47.715
...l'm gonna kill him.

39:55.519 --> 39:57.350
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

40:00.524 --> 40:02.640
I knew you'd try and talk me out of it.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.349
Damn right.

40:07.656 --> 40:08.645
Fair enough.

40:11.368 --> 40:14.201
My car! Hey!

40:42.733 --> 40:44.815
Son of a bitch.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.751
What's for dinner?

41:07.215 --> 41:10.127
Rabbit. I think.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.419
Good. l'm starving.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.556
What are you doing
running errands for Locke?

41:22.898 --> 41:24.934
I ain't runnin' errands for nobody.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.770
He said he sent you
over to the other island.

41:27.861 --> 41:30.728
- Did you find the plane?
- Yeah.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.488
And that ain't the
only thing over there.

41:35.702 --> 41:40.196
A guy named Widmore set up camp on
the beach, got a whole team with him.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.871
Guys with guns.

41:43.919 --> 41:48.083
- They're here for Locke.
- So what are you gonna do?

41:49.966 --> 41:51.877
I'm gonna let them fight it out.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.840
And while they got their hands
full with each other...

41:58.100 --> 42:00.933
...you and me are gettin'
the hell off this island.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.690
Even if we could get on
that plane, who's gonna fly it?

42:12.197 --> 42:14.609
We ain't taking the plane, Freckles.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.900
We're taking the sub.
