WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:13.600
all right,just a few more feet. And...

00:13.610 --> 00:17.280
here we are,gentlemen,the
gates of elzebob.

00:17.290 --> 00:18.820
Good lord.

00:18.830 --> 00:22.210
Don't panic. This is what the
last 97 hours have been about.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.560
Stay frosty. There's a
horde of armed goblins

00:24.570 --> 00:27.870
on the other side of that gate
guarding the sword of asaroth.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.280
Warriors,unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders,raise your wands.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.430
Lock and load.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.350
Raj,blow the gates.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.350
Blowing the gates.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.640
Control,shift...

00:39.950 --> 00:41.080
b!

00:42.910 --> 00:45.120
oh,my god,so many goblins!

00:46.120 --> 00:48.370
Don't just stand there,slash
and move,slash and move!

00:48.380 --> 00:49.520
Stay in formation!

00:49.530 --> 00:50.930
Leonard,you got one on your tail.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.320
That's all right,my tail's
prehensile- - I'll swat him off.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.670
I got him,leonard.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.440
Tonight I spice my
mead with goblin blood.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.460
Raj,no,it's a trap! They're flanking us!

01:00.920 --> 01:02.390
He's got me!

01:02.400 --> 01:05.000
Sheldon,he's got raj.
Use your sleep spell!

01:05.349 --> 01:06.970
Sheldon... sheldon?

01:06.980 --> 01:10.440
I've got the sword of asaroth!

01:11.100 --> 01:12.710
Forget the sword,sheldon,help raj!

01:12.720 --> 01:14.340
There is no more sheldon.

01:14.350 --> 01:16.560
I am the sword master!

01:16.570 --> 01:17.770
Leonard,look out!

01:17.780 --> 01:19.180
Damn it,man,we're dying here!

01:19.190 --> 01:20.820
Good
- bye,peasants!

01:21.880 --> 01:23.470
the bastard teleported!

01:25.120 --> 01:27.740
He's selling the sword
of asaroth on ebay.

01:29.070 --> 01:31.500
You betrayed us for money? Who are you?

01:31.510 --> 01:35.220
I'm a rogue night elf. Don't you
people read character descriptions?

01:35.650 --> 01:38.180
Wait,wait,wait! Somebody
just clicked "buy it now.

01:38.190 --> 01:41.900
" I am the sword master!

01:42.940 --> 01:46.400
Our whole universe was
in a hot,dense state

01:46.410 --> 01:48.650
then nearly 14 billion years

01:48.660 --> 01:50.000
go expansion started... wait!

01:50.430 --> 01:52.980
The earth began to cool the
autotrophs began to drool,

01:52.990 --> 01:54.410
neanderthals developed tools

01:54.420 --> 01:55.350
we built the wall

01:55.360 --> 01:56.340
we built the pyramids

01:56.350 --> 01:59.070
math, science,history,
unraveling the mystery

01:59.080 --> 02:01.200
that all started with a big bang bang!

02:05.130 --> 02:08.910
Ooh,I'm all sweaty. Anybody want to
log on to second life and go swimming?

02:08.919 --> 02:10.650
I just built a virtual pool.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.740
No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.450
sounds like your neighbor's home.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.970
Excuse me.

02:23.980 --> 02:26.030
Don't forget the mail you
took accidentally on purpose

02:26.040 --> 02:27.470
so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.490
Oh,right,right,right,right.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.270
Stealing
snail mail- -

02:34.380 --> 02:38.220
Penny,the mailman,did it
again... he... oh,sorry.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.620
Um,oh,hi,leonard. This is doug.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.050
Doug,this is my neighbor leonard.

02:42.060 --> 02:43.640
What's up,bro?

02:45.430 --> 02:47.530
Not much...

02:48.820 --> 02:50.500
bro.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.320
Is everything okay?

02:52.330 --> 02:54.740
Yeah,no,I just... I got
your mail again. Here.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.390
Thank you. I've got to
talk to that mailman.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.970
Oh,no,that's probably
not such a good idea.

03:00.710 --> 03:05.410
You know,civil servants have a documented
propensity to,you know,snap,so...

03:06.480 --> 03:08.550
okay. Well,thank you again.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.310
No problem. Bye.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.710
Oh,and bye... bro.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.810
Penny for your thoughts.

03:24.860 --> 03:26.130
What's the matter?

03:26.140 --> 03:28.750
I'm fine. Penny's fine.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.410
The guy she's kissing is really fine.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.980
Kissing,what kind of kissing? Cheeks?

03:36.900 --> 03:39.100
What is wrong with you?

03:39.810 --> 03:42.290
I'm a romantic.

03:43.470 --> 03:47.650
Please don't tell me that your hopeless
infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.770
I'm not jealous. I'm just
a little concerned for her.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.810
I didn't like the look of
the guy that she was with.

03:52.820 --> 03:54.720
Because he looks better than you?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.700
Yeah.

03:58.270 --> 04:00.200
He was kind of dreamy.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.660
Well,at least now you can retrieve
the black box from the twisted,

04:03.670 --> 04:06.290
olsmdering wreckage that was
once your fantasy of dating her

04:06.300 --> 04:10.380
and analyze the data so that you
don't crash into geek mountain.

04:11.810 --> 04:15.980
I di. Greesa love is not
a sprint,it's a marathon- -

04:15.990 --> 04:20.990
a relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.550
or hits you with the pepper spray.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.430
No,I'm done with penny.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.490
I'm going to be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.690
Like who?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.040
I don't know... olivia geiger.

04:33.050 --> 04:36.270
The dietician at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

04:38.470 --> 04:39.410
Yeah.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.370
Oh,I don't think you have a shot there.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.830
I have noticed that leslie winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.510
Now given that winter is coming,

04:47.520 --> 04:50.660
one can only assume she's
signaling sexual availability.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.320
I don't know. You guys
work in the same lab.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.280
So?

04:54.290 --> 04:57.400
There are pitfalls. Trust me,I know.

04:57.410 --> 05:02.890
When it comes to sexual harassment
law,I'm a bit of a self taught expert.

05:05.310 --> 05:08.600
Look,howard,if I were to ask leslie
winkle out,it would just be for dinner.

05:08.610 --> 05:12.770
I'm not going to walk into the lab,ask
her to strip naked and dance for me.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.860
Oh,then you're probably okay.

05:18.770 --> 05:19.840
Hello,leslie.

05:19.850 --> 05:20.980
Hi,leonard.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.400
Leslie,I would like to
propose an experiment...

05:22.410 --> 05:24.080
- goggles,leonard.
- Right.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.320
Leslie,I would like p
toropose an experiment.

05:28.330 --> 05:29.520
Hang on.

05:29.530 --> 05:33.320
I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500
- kilowatt oxygen iodine laser

05:33.330 --> 05:35.480
to heat up my cup a' noodles.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.570
I've done it. About two
seconds. 2. 6 for minestrone.

05:46.080 --> 05:51.410
anyway,I was thinking more of a bio- social
exploration with a neuro- chemical overlay.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.890
Wait,are you asking me out?

05:56.390 --> 06:01.160
I was going to characterize it as the modification
of our colleague- slash- friendship paradigm

06:01.170 --> 06:03.050
with the addition of a date
 like component,

06:03.060 --> 06:06.660
but we don't need to
quibble over terminology.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.010
What sort of experiment
would you propose?

06:09.020 --> 06:12.040
There's a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

06:12.050 --> 06:13.670
I would pick you up,take
you to a restaurant.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.400
Then we would see a movie,

06:15.410 --> 06:19.940
probably a romantic comedy featuring the
talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.810
Interesting.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.640
And would you agree that the
primary way we would evaluate

06:24.650 --> 06:27.030
either the success or failure
of the date would be based

06:27.040 --> 06:29.570
on the biochemical reaction
during the good night kiss?

06:29.580 --> 06:31.700
Heart rate,pheromones,etc. Yes.

06:32.550 --> 06:36.170
Why don't we just stipulate that the date
goes well and move to the key variable?

06:36.590 --> 06:37.640
You mean kiss you now?

06:37.650 --> 06:38.610
Yes.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.320
Can you define the
parameters of the kiss?

06:40.330 --> 06:42.170
Close
- mouthed but romantic. Mint?

06:42.180 --> 06:43.680
Thank you.

06:50.860 --> 06:51.940
shall I count down from three?

06:51.950 --> 06:54.560
No,I think it needs to be spontaneous.

07:01.730 --> 07:02.680
What do you think?

07:02.690 --> 07:06.030
You proposed the experiment. I think
you should present your findings first.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.360
Fair enough.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.740
On the plus side,it was a good kiss.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.250
Reasonable technique,no
extraneous spittle.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.000
On the other hand,no arousal.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.610
- None?
- None.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.530
Well,thank you for your time.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.160
Thanyok U.

07:31.230 --> 07:33.180
None at all?

07:37.060 --> 07:42.680
Sheldon,if you were a robot,and
I knew and you didn'T... ...

07:44.680 --> 07:46.760
would you want me to tell you?

07:48.060 --> 07:49.830
That depends.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.360
When I learn that I'm a robot...

07:53.370 --> 07:56.400
will I be able to handle it?

07:56.830 --> 08:00.380
Maybe- - although the history of
science fiction is not on your side.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.640
Okay,uh,let me
ask you this- -

08:03.650 --> 08:05.870
when I learn that I'm a robot,

08:05.880 --> 08:08.720
would I be bound by asimov's
three laws of robotics?

08:10.210 --> 08:13.590
You might be bound by them right now.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.030
That's true.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.330
Have you ever harmed a human being

08:19.340 --> 08:21.590
or through inaction allowed
a human being to come to harm?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.360
Of course not.

08:22.370 --> 08:25.090
Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed
yourself to be harmed except in cases

08:25.100 --> 08:27.760
where a human being would
have been endangered?

08:27.770 --> 08:28.760
Well,no.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.770
I smell robot.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.280
Hey,what's going on?

08:35.289 --> 08:37.740
Internet's been down for half an hour.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.309
Also,sheldon may be a robot.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.070
So how'd it go with leslie?

08:46.750 --> 08:50.630
Oh,we tried kissing,but
the earth didn't move.

08:51.210 --> 08:54.910
I mean,any more than the 383 miles
that it was going to move anyway.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.410
Oh,I've seen that look before.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.630
This is just going to
be two weeks of moping

09:01.640 --> 09:03.250
and tedious emo songs

09:03.260 --> 09:06.510
and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.230
I don't know if I can take it.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.070
You could power down.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.490
Well,as usual,wolowitz has the solution.

09:19.780 --> 09:23.220
I happen to know a place where
there are plenty of eligible women

09:23.230 --> 09:25.390
and leonard could have his pick.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:34.930 --> 09:37.000
remember the latin hips.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.280
Shoulders stay still,and... we sway.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.350
One,two,three... ...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.490
five,six,seven.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.350
I think mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

09:54.370 --> 09:56.420
I've been there. You're in for a treat.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.500
She said,"you don't know me"

10:05.510 --> 10:09.990
doyou "n't even care"

10:10.000 --> 10:11.880
oh,yeah...

10:11.890 --> 10:13.080
oh,good lord.

10:13.090 --> 10:16.450
She said,"you don't know me"

10:16.460 --> 10:21.600
"you don't wear my chains"

10:22.400 --> 10:25.440
oh,yeah. God,that's a good song.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.420
If you're compiling a mix
cd for a double suicide.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.460
Oh,I hope that scratching
post is for you.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.020
I know what you're thinking. I've
taken your asthma into account.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.210
There's a feline geneticist in san diego

10:39.220 --> 10:42.290
who's developed the cutest
little hypoallergenic calicos.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.280
Leonard,listen to me...

10:43.290 --> 10:44.420
I've been thinking about names.

10:44.430 --> 10:48.480
I'm kind of torn between
einstein,newton and sergeant fuzzy boots.

10:49.510 --> 10:51.440
Leonard,do you really think
you can satisfy your need

10:51.450 --> 10:54.230
for a relationshh witip
a genetically altered cat?

10:54.860 --> 10:56.050
Maybe.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.650
If it's a cute,little,cuddly cat.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.020
Oh,come on. Leonard...

11:03.110 --> 11:05.270
this is obviously about penny.

11:07.470 --> 11:08.790
It doesn't matter.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.690
The woman's not interested
in me. The woman rejected me.

11:11.700 --> 11:18.620
Okay,look,I think that you have as much of a
chance of having a sexual relationship with penny

11:18.630 --> 11:22.780
as the hubble telescope does of discovering at
the center of every black hole is a little man

11:22.790 --> 11:25.740
with a flashlight searching
for a circuit breaker.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.180
Nevertheless,

11:30.190 --> 11:35.040
I do feel obligated to point out
to you that she did not reject you.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.790
You did not ask her out.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.740
You're right.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.760
I didn't ask her out.
I should ask her out.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.990
No,no,now that was not my point.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.040
My point was don't buy a cat.

11:48.630 --> 11:50.650
No,but you're right.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.160
I should march over
there and ask her out.

11:53.570 --> 11:56.230
Oh,goody,we're getting a cat.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.430
Uh... no.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.540
Oh,hey,leonard.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.120
Good afternoon,penny. So,hi... hey.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.030
Uh...

12:09.480 --> 12:11.450
I was wondering if you
had plans for dinner.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.160
Uh,you mean dinner tonight?

12:14.350 --> 12:16.710
There is an inherent
ambiguity in the word "dinner.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.220
" Technically it refers to the largest
meal of the day whenever it's consumed.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.810
So to clarify here,by
dinner I mean supper.

12:22.820 --> 12:24.720
- Supper?
- Or dinner.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.760
I was thinking 6:30 if you
can go. Or a different time.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.360
Uh,6:30's great.

12:30.370 --> 12:31.970
Really?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.370
Great.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.040
Yeah,I like hanging out with you guys.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.130
Us guys?

12:37.140 --> 12:40.180
Yeah,you know,sheldon,howard,raj.
Who all's coming?

12:41.180 --> 12:45.070
They... might all be there.

12:46.790 --> 12:49.330
Or a subset of them might be there.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.950
Algebraically speaking,there
are too many unknowns.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.190
For example,sheldon
had quiznos for lunch.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.650
Sometimes he finds that
filling,other times he doesn'T.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.750
It's no fault of quiznos-
- they have a varied menu.

13:01.770 --> 13:03.790
Okay,whatever. It sounds like fun.

13:04.270 --> 13:06.710
Great. Did we say a time?

13:06.720 --> 13:07.570
6:30.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.370
- And that's still good for you?
- It's fine.

13:09.380 --> 13:12.080
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone.
- No,6:30's great.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.300
I'll get my chisel.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.710
Why?

13:18.720 --> 13:22.270
To... carve the... I'll see you at 6:30.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.260
How do I look?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.690
Could you be more specific?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.480
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

13:46.510 --> 13:47.570
No.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.210
The dark crescent shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

13:53.170 --> 13:54.250
What time is your date?

13:54.260 --> 13:55.230
6:30.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.060
Perfect. That gives you
two hours and 15 minutes for

13:58.070 --> 14:00.820
that dense molecular cloud
of aramis to dissipate.

14:01.950 --> 14:03.070
Is it too much?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.250
Not if you're a rugby team.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.120
By the way,if it should ever
come up,you didn't join us

14:09.130 --> 14:12.190
because you stuffed yourself with
a chicken carbonara sub at quiznos.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.580
Why would I join you?

14:14.890 --> 14:16.500
No reason.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.310
Oh,you know what,maybe
this isn't such a good idea.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.750
Oh,no,well,now there's always the
possibility that alcohol and poor judgment

14:25.760 --> 14:28.420
on her part might lead to
a nice romantic evening.

14:30.220 --> 14:33.040
You're right. Alcohol,poor
judgment- - it could go well.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.390
Of course there is
the other possibility,

14:35.400 --> 14:38.120
that this date kicks off a
rather unpleasant six months

14:38.130 --> 14:39.870
of the two of you passing
awkwardly in the hall,

14:39.880 --> 14:42.530
until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.950
You could've stopped
at "it could go well.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.820
" If I could've,I would've.

14:49.830 --> 14:51.900
I mean,I'm a perfectly nice guy.

14:52.240 --> 14:55.490
There's no reason we couldn't go to
the restaurant,and have a lovely dinner,

14:55.500 --> 15:00.000
maybe take a walk afterwards,talk
about things we have in common.

15:00.010 --> 15:03.630
You love pottery? I love pottery!

15:03.640 --> 15:06.400
There's a pause,we both
know what's happening.

15:06.410 --> 15:07.450
I lean in,we kiss.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.390
It's a little tentative at first,but
then I realize she's kissing me back.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.670
She's biting my lower lip! She wants me!

15:12.680 --> 15:14.730
This thing is going the
distance! We're going to have sex!

15:14.740 --> 15:16.900
Oh,god,oh,my god!

15:18.790 --> 15:21.160
Is the sex starting now?

15:22.220 --> 15:23.470
I'm having a panic attack.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.260
Oh,okay. Uh,well then... calm down.

15:27.140 --> 15:30.740
If I could calm down,I wobe having a panic
att... that's why they call it a panic attack.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.130
All right,all right.
Uh,s- s- sit down.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.620
Yeah,sit down. Now close your eyes.

15:35.630 --> 15:36.780
- Why?
- Just do it.

15:36.790 --> 15:37.490
Okay.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.780
Now try to increase
your alpha wave activity.

15:40.790 --> 15:41.660
What? !

15:41.670 --> 15:43.830
It's a biofeedback technique.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.670
It's relaxation through
brain wave manipulation.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.470
I read a paper about it in
journal of american neuroscience.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.280
It was a little sparsely sourced,but
I think the basic science is valid.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.980
I probably have it here somewher E.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.750
Who am I kidding? I can't
go through with this.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.330
You need to call her and cancel.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.200
- Me?
- Yes.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.460
- What should I tell her?
- I don't know.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.200
- Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

16:02.210 --> 16:04.870
Not the kind of illness that will make
her want to come over and take care of me,

16:04.880 --> 16:08.460
but nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable going out with me in the future

16:08.470 --> 16:09.540
if I want to try this again.

16:09.550 --> 16:10.690
Got it.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.470
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?

16:16.860 --> 16:20.450
I'll just tell her that you had a routine
conoloscopy and haven't quite bounced back.

16:21.710 --> 16:22.710
Give me the phone.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.000
I thought you wanted to cancel.

16:24.010 --> 16:26.690
I can't,because if I don't show
up she'll still be expecting you.

16:27.530 --> 16:29.070
Why would she be expecting me?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.540
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.420
So are the rest of the
guys meeting us here?

16:39.430 --> 16:41.480
Oh,yeah... no.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.720
It turns out that raj and
howard had to work,and sheldon...

16:46.190 --> 16:49.670
had a colonoscopy and he
hasn't quite bounced back yet.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.540
Oh,my uncle just had a colonoscopy.

16:53.550 --> 16:57.040
You're kidding. Then that's
something we have in common.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.810
How?

16:59.820 --> 17:02.840
We both have people in our lives who...

17:02.850 --> 17:06.290
want to nip intestinal
polyps in the bud.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.990
so what's new in the world of physics?

17:15.589 --> 17:17.369
Nothing.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.680
Really? Nothing?

17:19.690 --> 17:25.359
Well,with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s.

17:25.369 --> 17:27.280
And you can't prove string theory.

17:27.290 --> 17:29.050
At best you can say,"hey,look,

17:29.060 --> 17:32.820
my idea has an internal
logical consistency.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.250
" Ah.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.420
Well,I'm sure things will pick up.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.900
What's new at the cheesecake factory?

17:43.910 --> 17:46.440
Oh,uh,not much.

17:46.450 --> 17:50.050
We do have a chocolate key
lime that's moving pretty well.

17:51.050 --> 17:54.030
Good. Good.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.910
What about your,uh...

17:59.920 --> 18:01.730
hallway friend?

18:01.740 --> 18:04.270
Doug? Oh,yeah,I don't know.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.390
I mean,you know,he's
nice and funny,but...

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
can I get you started with some drinks?

18:07.410 --> 18:09.220
No!

18:09.930 --> 18:11.890
- You were saying? But...
- I'd like a drink.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.790
Just say the "but" thing about
doug and then I'll get her back.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.020
Okay,well,I don't know,it's just me.

18:19.030 --> 18:21.460
I'm still getting over
this breakup with kurt

18:21.470 --> 18:24.220
and this thing with doug
would stju be rebound sex.

18:24.690 --> 18:28.050
Oh,don't get me started on rebound sex.

18:29.290 --> 18:30.910
It's just... it's my pattern.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.310
I break up,then I find some cute guy,

18:33.320 --> 18:37.240
and then it's just 36
meaningless hours of...

18:37.250 --> 18:39.220
you know.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.330
I'm not sure that I do.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.600
is that one 36-hour experience,

18:46.610 --> 18:49.190
or is that 36 hours
spread out over,say...

18:49.200 --> 18:51.670
one glorious summer?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.450
No,it's usually over a weekend,

18:53.460 --> 18:56.150
and trust me,you do
not feel good after it.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.730
Well,chafing,right?

19:00.060 --> 19:01.110
Emotionally.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.590
Of course,yeah,emotional chafing.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.320
Hey,do you want to see something cool?

19:14.650 --> 19:18.980
I can make this olive go into
this glass without touching it.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.890
- How?
- Physics.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.470
Wow,centrifugal force.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.810
Actually,it's centripetal force,

19:31.820 --> 19:35.980
which is an inward force generated
by the glass acting on the olive...

19:37.250 --> 19:38.730
Excuse me.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.760
If you were riding on the olive,

19:41.770 --> 19:45.030
you'd be in a non
- inertial reference frame and would...

19:46.970 --> 19:47.910
are you okay?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.620
Yeah,I'm okay.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.460
Did you spill ketchup?

19:52.470 --> 19:54.660
- No.
- I'm not okay.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.930
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the emergency room?

19:58.940 --> 20:01.900
No,no,I'm okay. It stopped bleeding.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.820
I know,but you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

20:04.830 --> 20:07.790
Yes. But I get car sick,too,so...

20:08.460 --> 20:09.870
okay.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.530
Sorry about your car,by the way.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.220
Oh,no,it's fine. You got
most of it out the window.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.160
The poor guy on the bike.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.780
Well,I had a nice time.

20:21.790 --> 20:23.600
Yeah,me,too.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.030
Well,um,good night.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.980
Good night.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.510
- Leonard?
- Ahye?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.720
Was this supposed to be a date?

20:34.310 --> 20:36.000
This?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.840
No.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.870
No,of course not.

20:40.880 --> 20:43.540
This was just you and me
hanging out with a bunch of guys

20:43.550 --> 20:46.900
who didn't show up 'cause
of work and a colonoscopy.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.970
Okay,I was just checking.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.360
When I take a girl on
a date- - and I do- -

20:57.040 --> 20:59.490
she knows she's been dated.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.310
Capital D.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.400
boldface. Undeinrled.

21:05.410 --> 21:08.160
Da... ted.

21:08.890 --> 21:11.770
I think I might have a little
concussion. I'm gonna go lie down.

21:11.780 --> 21:13.620
Good night.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.060
So,how was your date?

21:19.070 --> 21:21.060
Awesome!

21:24.550 --> 21:27.130
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.
