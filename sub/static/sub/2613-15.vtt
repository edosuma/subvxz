01:26.852 --> 01:29.488
That one's not ours.

01:29.488 --> 01:30.122
You sure?

01:30.122 --> 01:34.259
I authorize all cadavers
and associated research.

01:34.259 --> 01:35.726
He's not ours.

01:37.429 --> 01:40.532
People donate their
body to science,

01:40.532 --> 01:42.534
end up submerged in a pond?

01:42.534 --> 01:43.769
Cram med in a car?

01:43.769 --> 01:46.705
Body farm; creepy.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.240
A body farm
is not creepy.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.376
It's a controlled study of
situational decomposition.

01:51.376 --> 01:52.878
All in all,
a very helpful place.

01:52.878 --> 01:55.380
Tell that to Slim
hanging from the tree.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.917
Whoever placed our victim here
knew that the body farm existed.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.252
What they didn't know
is each body

02:00.252 --> 02:01.687
is tracked by
a bunch of scientists.

02:01.687 --> 02:03.922
Can't just slip a card
into the deck.

02:03.922 --> 02:08.086
Well, he's not in rigor.
TSD is under six hours.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.788
I'll move him as soon as
you're finished.

02:09.828 --> 02:11.230
- Any I.D.? - None.

02:11.230 --> 02:13.664
Okay, then move him.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.772
Gunshot wound to the chest.

02:20.772 --> 02:22.674
Well, look.

02:22.674 --> 02:25.142
One of your friends.

02:35.187 --> 02:36.822
It's a carpet beetle.

02:36.822 --> 02:37.856
It shouldn't be here.

02:37.856 --> 02:40.359
Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind

02:40.359 --> 02:43.896
Carpet beetles are the last
to arrive at a corpse...

02:43.896 --> 02:45.597
when it's almost a skeleton.

02:45.597 --> 02:48.157
I mean, this guy's still fresh.

02:54.907 --> 02:57.576
David, get this body
out of here now!

02:57.576 --> 02:59.211
We got cross-contamination!

03:33.212 --> 03:36.048
Wow! You got to go
to the body farm?

03:36.048 --> 03:36.648
Yeah.

03:36.648 --> 03:38.717
I've always wanted
to go there.

03:38.717 --> 03:39.918
What was it like?

03:39.918 --> 03:40.519
Quiet.

03:40.519 --> 03:43.388
I hear Grissom
goes there all the time.

03:43.388 --> 03:45.557
Like, even on his nights off.

03:45.557 --> 03:48.993
Why does that
not surprise me?

03:50.062 --> 03:53.532
Man, something stinks
in here again.

03:53.532 --> 03:55.834
What, bad milk?
Cottage- cheese bad?

03:55.834 --> 03:58.503
Worse. It's all
over my sandwich.

03:58.503 --> 03:59.868
Smell that.

04:05.777 --> 04:07.045
Yeah.

04:07.045 --> 04:10.115
He's got one of his
experiments in there.

04:10.115 --> 04:11.416
You're kidding me?

04:11.416 --> 04:12.484
Bugs or blood?

04:12.484 --> 04:13.285
Not bugs.

04:13.285 --> 04:15.320
Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community

04:15.320 --> 04:18.290
Someone has got to talk
to Grissom about this.

04:18.290 --> 04:19.257
Talk to me about what?

04:19.257 --> 04:23.217
You leaving your
experiments in our
refrigerator.

04:23.262 --> 04:26.231
The lab fridge was full. I put in last night.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.966
I'm going to test for horizontal motion
on bloodstains.

04:27.966 --> 04:30.102
Vis-a-vis surface
textures.

04:30.102 --> 04:32.771
Hey, any of you guys got
any linoleum at home?

04:32.771 --> 04:35.807
That blood
is rank, man.

04:35.807 --> 04:38.176
That's why the Red Cross
gives it to us...

04:38.176 --> 04:40.371
'cause it's past
its expiration date.

04:43.448 --> 04:46.385
Anything new on the
body farm victim?

04:46.385 --> 04:47.819
I gave the prints
to Identification.

04:47.819 --> 04:49.921
They're running through
the base s now.

04:49.921 --> 04:50.785
Okay.

04:54.826 --> 04:57.852
I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.

04:58.797 --> 05:00.966
Way to go, Nick. You really told him.

05:00.966 --> 05:02.734
I told him. He just...

05:02.734 --> 05:03.969
doesn't hear it.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.203
Yeah.

05:05.203 --> 05:07.205
Well...

05:07.205 --> 05:11.810
the entry wound tells me
the body sustained a projectile.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.744
A bullet.

05:12.744 --> 05:17.082
But there's no bullet
fragments in the tissue,

05:17.082 --> 05:18.317
and no exit wound.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.851
So, how do
you explain that?

05:19.851 --> 05:22.945
Bullet wounds usually
leave bullet evidence.

05:27.392 --> 05:31.294
There's no evidence
of a bullet in this wound tract.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.298
So, let's excise it.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.300
Do a more
localized search.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.302
That was my next suggestion.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.669
What's your best tool for excising the tissue
of our Mr. Doe?

05:40.739 --> 05:42.040
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.975
Database says
that our victim

05:43.975 --> 05:45.477
is Mike Kimble,

05:45.477 --> 05:46.345
age 38.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.847
He has a townhouse
in Summerlin.

05:48.847 --> 05:51.583
Brass is going to
meet us there along with the rest of the unit.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.353
My bet says that it's
the primary crime scene.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.651
Good.

05:57.456 --> 05:59.048
Aren't you coming?

05:59.558 --> 06:02.194
We're excising
a wound tract.

06:02.194 --> 06:03.962
Sounds fascinating.

06:03.962 --> 06:05.224
It is.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.007
Is that Mike Kimble's house?

06:16.007 --> 06:17.406
That's it.

06:20.212 --> 06:22.814
Seems like somebody
beat us here.

06:22.814 --> 06:23.682
You think?

06:23.682 --> 06:27.252
Neighbor called it in.
She smelled the smoke.

06:27.252 --> 06:29.888
Thought he was barbecuing
in his living room.

06:29.888 --> 06:31.656
Where's his neighbor now?

06:31.656 --> 06:33.125
Over there talking to Brass.

06:33.125 --> 06:39.398
Um... no, I didn't hear any
noise coming from Mike's place last night.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.065
But, um...

06:40.065 --> 06:42.401
I was wearing my headphones,
doing my workout.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.803
Did Mr. Kimble have many
visitors to his house?

06:44.803 --> 06:47.406
Other than his clients,
just, um...

06:47.406 --> 06:48.540
just his fiancé, Jane.

06:48.540 --> 06:51.710
Uh... but they usually
stayed at her place.

06:51.710 --> 06:55.407
Do you have the full name
and address of the victim's fiancé, Jane?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.815
Yes, actually, I do.

06:56.815 --> 06:57.616
It's in my kitchen.

06:57.616 --> 07:05.524
As soon as they let me back in,
I can get for you.

07:05.524 --> 07:08.293
Something...

07:08.293 --> 07:09.494
a metal fragment.

07:09.494 --> 07:13.665
It's not like any bullet
I've ever seen.

07:13.665 --> 07:15.534
Titanium...

07:15.534 --> 07:17.202
maybe a pin.

07:17.202 --> 07:19.037
From the ribs?

07:19.037 --> 07:21.239
Oh, here's
the manufacturer's number.

07:21.239 --> 07:24.609
I should've bought stock
when I first started finding

07:24.609 --> 07:27.373
all these medical implants.

07:33.318 --> 07:34.519
Bovine.

07:34.519 --> 07:35.954
Excuse me?

07:35.954 --> 07:36.621
Genus Hypaderma.

07:36.621 --> 07:40.225
These are normally found
in the intestinal tract of cows.

07:40.225 --> 07:43.395
These maggots aren't
found in humans.

07:43.395 --> 07:44.896
Foreign tissue. Cow.

07:44.896 --> 07:46.531
Makes absolutely no sense.

07:46.531 --> 07:51.703
The body farm also studies
animals, not just humans.

07:51.703 --> 07:54.973
This more of your
cross-contamination?

07:54.973 --> 07:58.409
Only one way to find out.

08:15.861 --> 08:17.796
What up, Doc?

08:17.796 --> 08:18.997
Hey, there you are.

08:18.997 --> 08:21.158
Sorry I'm late.

08:21.233 --> 08:23.463
D.A. Wanted an update
on my robbery case.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.437
Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting
my walk-through.

08:28.807 --> 08:31.799
The desk is crispy.

08:34.578 --> 08:38.383
There's a burn pattern for you.

08:38.383 --> 08:40.452
Fire burns upward.

08:40.452 --> 08:43.255
This is moving downward.

08:43.255 --> 08:45.390
Defies the laws of physics.

08:45.390 --> 08:46.858
Fire's draw n to fire.

08:46.858 --> 08:49.394
Well, you know
what we got to do.

08:49.394 --> 08:51.329
Check out the upstairs?

08:51.329 --> 08:54.492
Well, the guy
who started the fire

08:54.533 --> 08:57.135
wanted to make sure the
bedroom got it worse.

08:57.135 --> 08:58.537
How do you know it's a guy?

08:58.537 --> 09:00.171
Why are you jumping the gun?

09:00.171 --> 09:01.740
Well, according to Sara,

09:01.740 --> 09:03.775
94% of all arsonists
are male.

09:03.775 --> 09:05.777
Yeah, that sounds
like Sara.

09:05.777 --> 09:08.813
The fire burned longest here.

09:08.813 --> 09:11.805
It's the point of origin
right here.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.720
I don't smell any accelerant.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.788
Could have burned off.

09:16.788 --> 09:18.056
Fabric would have fueled it.

09:18.056 --> 09:20.358
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

09:20.358 --> 09:22.121
Afire burning downward?

09:22.827 --> 09:26.854
Must have found an accelerant.

09:29.801 --> 09:32.929
Furniture polish.

09:38.143 --> 09:39.872
Warrick...

09:44.983 --> 09:47.781
Is that blood?

09:51.456 --> 09:53.358
Oh, man.

09:53.358 --> 09:55.727
Something bad happened here.

09:55.727 --> 09:59.595
This fire is just a cover-up.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.839
Are you serious?

10:07.839 --> 10:09.941
Hold on a second. Hi.

10:09.941 --> 10:12.877
I'm Detective Jim Brass.

10:12.877 --> 10:14.212
Is Jane Bradley in?

10:14.212 --> 10:15.780
She's in the kitchen.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.749
Really? No.

10:17.749 --> 10:21.553
This can't be happening.

10:21.553 --> 10:22.687
Mike is dead?

10:22.687 --> 10:27.058
I don't know how
I'm going to tell my kids.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.293
They love Mike.

10:28.293 --> 10:30.128
You and Mike were engaged?

10:30.128 --> 10:35.361
The wedding was supposed to
be in a week at the Tangiers.

10:40.071 --> 10:42.374
No sweets after 10:00.
What's the rule?

10:42.374 --> 10:44.909
Oh, come on, Mom,
I'm starving.

10:44.909 --> 10:47.036
Have an apple.

10:49.648 --> 10:52.350
He's growing
like a weed.

10:52.350 --> 10:55.487
What was your
fiancé's business?

10:55.487 --> 10:57.389
He was a photographer.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.190
He did weddings, events.

10:59.190 --> 11:02.861
We argued over who'd
do our wedding because

11:02.861 --> 11:05.421
he didn't trust
anyone else's work.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.067
Hi.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.369
How many times have I said you have to

11:11.369 --> 11:13.038
You can't just
barge in this house.

11:13.038 --> 11:14.739
Maybe as many times
as I've asked you

11:14.739 --> 11:17.409
to have the kids
ready and out front
on my nights?

11:17.409 --> 11:20.178
You must be the ex-husband.

11:20.178 --> 11:21.546
What's going on?

11:21.546 --> 11:23.214
Are the kids
all right?

11:23.214 --> 11:25.383
Is Jake in some kind of trouble?

11:25.383 --> 11:26.484
No.

11:26.484 --> 11:28.520
Mike Kimble was
killed tonight.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.852
Are you serious?

11:33.058 --> 11:36.528
Would you mind
showing us your hands?

11:36.528 --> 11:37.362
My hands? Why?

11:37.362 --> 11:42.333
To see if there's any gunpowder
or evidence of a burn on them.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.699
Sure.

11:45.203 --> 11:47.038
Look, uh... I don't
want to be rude, but...

11:47.038 --> 11:49.441
I stop paying alimony the day
Mike and Jane get married.

11:49.441 --> 11:52.043
I mean, I'm the last person
who would have killed him.

11:52.043 --> 11:54.446
If we wanted to get in touch
with you,

11:54.446 --> 11:55.914
how would we reach you?

11:55.914 --> 12:00.218
You can reach me at any of my four grocery

12:00.218 --> 12:01.086
Anytime.

12:01.086 --> 12:01.920
We'll be in touch.

12:01.920 --> 12:06.124
I'm going to get the kids,
if that's all right.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.752
They're in the den.

12:30.281 --> 12:31.850
Accelerant.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.078
Hey.

12:33.151 --> 12:35.954
Yeah, Warrick said
the fire was orange,

12:35.954 --> 12:38.752
so low-temperature fuel.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.625
Something accessible...

12:40.625 --> 12:43.428
gasoline, kerosene...

12:43.428 --> 12:45.764
I thought you
were in post.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.364
I was.

12:46.364 --> 12:50.502
So, anyway, this is where
the fire started.

12:50.502 --> 12:52.436
Victim's bedroom.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.072
Grissom...

13:33.411 --> 13:34.879
Gris...

13:34.879 --> 13:38.679
Sometimes it's about
where the fire
isn't.

14:10.348 --> 14:13.340
Sometimes I hate this job.

14:16.287 --> 14:18.356
We have evidence

14:18.356 --> 14:19.190
that Mike
may have had

14:19.190 --> 14:22.427
an inappropriate
relationship
with your daughter.

14:22.427 --> 14:24.429
What kind of evidence?

14:24.429 --> 14:26.865
Photographic
and definitive.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.566
That the man
I was going to marry

14:28.566 --> 14:30.591
somehow sexually...

14:31.135 --> 14:33.304
No, I don't believe that.

14:33.304 --> 14:34.505
Things like
this happen...

14:34.505 --> 14:36.441
sometimes right
under our noses.

14:36.441 --> 14:40.545
We're going to have to talk with your

14:40.545 --> 14:44.115
Jody, we found pictures
in Mike's house

14:44.115 --> 14:45.216
of you posing.

14:45.216 --> 14:49.380
Tell her Mike would
never do anything
to hurt you.

14:51.689 --> 14:53.825
In some of the pictures...

14:53.825 --> 14:56.227
He truly was like
a father to both kids.

14:56.227 --> 14:59.890
I wish you would
just listen once.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.701
In some of the pictures,

15:03.701 --> 15:07.228
you're wearing a bathing suit.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.967
Do you remember
Mike taking them?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.222
Jody...

15:24.222 --> 15:28.726
Anything that he did to you
was not your fault.

15:28.726 --> 15:34.460
You can tell me
if Mike took
those pictures.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.868
Jody?

15:36.868 --> 15:38.436
Honey?

15:38.436 --> 15:41.005
I loved Mike

15:41.005 --> 15:43.439
and he loved me.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.610
The daughter clammed up.

15:56.654 --> 15:57.956
Seems to be in the
protect-the-abuser trap.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.792
I'm going to take her
over to the hospital
for a SART exam.

16:00.792 --> 16:04.462
What are the chances Mom knew what her

16:04.462 --> 16:05.396
I've seen it happen.

16:05.396 --> 16:06.864
As a mother,
I hope not.

16:06.864 --> 16:08.566
Yeah, right.

16:08.566 --> 16:10.796
I'm going
to look into it.

16:17.775 --> 16:21.346
Well, our photo guys tell me
those pictures were taken

16:21.346 --> 16:24.015
with Mike Kimble's
type of camera.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.083
Yeah?

16:25.083 --> 16:26.351
Yeah.

16:26.351 --> 16:28.086
What are you
doing here?

16:28.086 --> 16:29.520
A thousand points
of light,

16:29.520 --> 16:33.354
and I only need one
to clear up this picture.

16:37.128 --> 16:39.831
The blur equals
the length of the light.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.166
If I can compress this light
back into a point,

16:42.166 --> 16:45.795
then the rest of the picture
gets clear.

16:48.673 --> 16:50.575
That's how they got
Hinkley's image

16:50.575 --> 16:52.443
when he was shooting the prez.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.212
What is that...

16:54.212 --> 16:56.681
there...
bottom right corner?

16:56.681 --> 16:57.882
Is that a finger?

16:57.882 --> 16:59.517
Yeah, I think so.

16:59.517 --> 17:00.651
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?

17:00.651 --> 17:03.654
A professional photographer
gets a finger in the shot?

17:03.654 --> 17:06.523
Maybe his good hand
was otherwise engaged.

17:06.523 --> 17:08.291
I'm going to work
on that for a while

17:08.291 --> 17:10.962
and see if I can get
some ridge detail.

17:10.962 --> 17:12.296
Maybe even a fat print.

17:12.296 --> 17:14.298
I'll... I'll see you later.

17:14.298 --> 17:15.321
All right.

17:18.036 --> 17:20.471
So this is your experiment, huh?

17:20.471 --> 17:25.042
So, because you found beef in
the wound tracts of the victim,

17:25.042 --> 17:29.714
you think the meat might be
from one of the body farm cows?

17:29.714 --> 17:32.817
Did the fly find
the beef in the wound

17:32.817 --> 17:33.684
and lay its eggs,

17:33.684 --> 17:35.620
or did it bring
the beef with him?

17:35.620 --> 17:38.656
I did an experiment similar
to this in San Francisco,

17:38.656 --> 17:40.491
except the cross-contamination
was blood.

17:40.491 --> 17:44.825
Wasn't a murder case,
but it was instructional.

17:46.197 --> 17:48.066
None of these
beef particles

17:48.066 --> 17:52.503
are as big as the tissue found in Mike
Kimble's

17:53.604 --> 17:56.207
And I found out
the ex-husband

17:56.207 --> 18:00.478
is the proud owner
of a registered handgun.

18:00.478 --> 18:02.447
Hmm. What
does that mean?

18:02.447 --> 18:05.316
It means I need
to see that gun.

18:05.316 --> 18:06.150
Uh... Grissom?

18:06.150 --> 18:09.253
Aren't you going
to tell me anything?

18:09.253 --> 18:09.954
About?

18:09.954 --> 18:13.591
The case, the meat,
what you found...?

18:13.591 --> 18:14.625
I'm working it.

18:14.625 --> 18:17.595
I thought I was
working it with you.

18:17.595 --> 18:18.729
Yes.

18:18.729 --> 18:19.864
You're right,
you are.

18:19.864 --> 18:23.468
So, take some photos
of the experiment for the D.A.,

18:23.468 --> 18:25.470
and then get rid
of that stuff.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.239
That meat... the raw meat... me?

18:28.239 --> 18:28.840
Yeah.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.042
How many meals
have we shared together?

18:31.042 --> 18:31.909
I don't know.

18:31.909 --> 18:32.643
Take a guess...

18:32.643 --> 18:34.946
over a year working together.

18:34.946 --> 18:36.681
.30

18:36.681 --> 18:37.515
I'm a vegetarian.

18:37.515 --> 18:40.609
Everyone here knows
I'm a vegetarian.

18:40.718 --> 18:42.720
I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up

18:42.720 --> 18:46.557
It pains me to see ground beef;
forget about cleaning it up.

18:46.557 --> 18:48.359
Okay.

18:48.359 --> 18:49.951
Have Nick do it.

18:57.869 --> 18:58.703
You're telling me

18:58.703 --> 19:02.006
this bastard took
pictures of my daughter?

19:02.006 --> 19:04.742
We found them
in his house.

19:04.742 --> 19:08.479
I never liked the way
he looked at Jody.

19:08.479 --> 19:09.413
I never liked it.

19:09.413 --> 19:10.948
How did he look at her?

19:10.948 --> 19:12.183
Touchy - feely.

19:12.183 --> 19:14.413
It wasn't normal.

19:15.219 --> 19:17.822
I told Jane when
she started seeing him,

19:17.822 --> 19:18.723
he's not a good guy.

19:18.723 --> 19:20.892
He's not good for our family.

19:20.892 --> 19:25.930
But you can't control
who your ex-wife dates.

19:25.930 --> 19:28.566
Russ Bradley,
Gil Grissom, CSI Lab.

19:28.566 --> 19:30.557
Thanks for coming in.

19:31.769 --> 19:33.371
Is this your gun?

19:33.371 --> 19:34.305
Yes.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.541
May I take a look at it?

19:36.541 --> 19:38.270
Please.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.918
It's been cleaned.

19:46.918 --> 19:47.618
Of course.

19:47.618 --> 19:49.053
You never store
a dirty firearm.

19:49.053 --> 19:51.789
May I ask what kind
of ammunition you use?

19:51.789 --> 19:52.990
A.38 special.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.787
It takes.38s.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.686
Whatever's on sale.

20:12.076 --> 20:13.578
There you are.

20:13.578 --> 20:17.605
Got something
for you from Trace.

20:18.416 --> 20:19.417
Sara?

20:19.417 --> 20:22.318
Almost finished.

20:25.890 --> 20:29.493
They isolated
the accelerant
used in the fire.

20:29.493 --> 20:31.256
It's alcohol-based.

20:32.530 --> 20:35.800
Acetone,
methyl methacrylate?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.568
Nail polish remover.

20:37.568 --> 20:40.972
Guess that's
the six percent
no one talks about...

20:40.972 --> 20:42.837
female fire-starters.

20:50.481 --> 20:53.384
What's this... a burn?

20:53.384 --> 20:54.752
Yeah.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.188
How'd that happen?

20:57.188 --> 20:59.588
On a curling iron.

21:10.334 --> 21:12.103
I'll give you
a prescription
for antibiotics.

21:12.103 --> 21:15.971
Let's do the last portion
of your exam now, okay?

21:16.707 --> 21:18.504
Excuse me.

21:22.813 --> 21:24.382
Okay, lay back.

21:24.382 --> 21:26.617
Scoot back
a little more.

21:26.617 --> 21:28.552
Just a little more.

21:28.552 --> 21:29.520
Very good.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.989
Take a deep breath.

21:31.989 --> 21:33.957
This won't
hurt at all.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.955
It's melting.

22:44.729 --> 22:46.564
Sara's not going
to be too happy

22:46.564 --> 22:48.899
with that
experiment
in the fridge.

22:48.899 --> 22:52.164
I'm putting it
in the freezer.

22:54.772 --> 22:58.242
The doctor finished
the exam on Jody Bradley.

22:58.242 --> 22:59.677
Physical findings:

22:59.677 --> 23:03.113
Scarring,
chronic sexual abuse.

23:03.881 --> 23:06.384
Well, have Brass get a warrant for the

23:06.384 --> 23:09.420
Check the evidence we recovered from the

23:09.420 --> 23:10.688
They stayed in both places.

23:10.688 --> 23:13.257
Listen, there's a good chance the

23:13.257 --> 23:15.726
She had second-degree burns on her wrist.

23:15.726 --> 23:17.461
One thing at a time.

23:17.461 --> 23:18.396
Right.

23:18.396 --> 23:19.597
You coming with?

23:19.597 --> 23:20.731
I can't.

23:20.731 --> 23:21.832
Take Nick.

23:21.832 --> 23:24.402
Right.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.563
Experiment.

24:13.184 --> 24:16.017
That's the girl's
nightgown.

24:17.621 --> 24:20.191
We've got some samples coming in.

24:20.191 --> 24:21.492
They're priority one.

24:21.492 --> 24:22.960
What is that... what did you find?

24:22.960 --> 24:26.163
Child Services will be remanding Jody to a

24:26.163 --> 24:29.428
Was my fiancé involved in any way?

24:29.467 --> 24:32.436
He's not your fiancé.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.097
Not anymore, anyway.

24:34.138 --> 24:35.435
Jim?

24:35.473 --> 24:37.575
I just got back from the events office at the

24:37.575 --> 24:40.044
where you and Mike were supposed
to be married.

24:40.044 --> 24:42.444
You canceled your wedding five days ago.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.683
I even have your
credit card receipt for the ten percent

24:45.683 --> 24:49.887
You didn't like the way he looked at your

24:49.887 --> 24:51.821
No. I just got cold feet.

24:51.989 --> 24:53.149
Convenient timing.

24:53.190 --> 24:55.125
Look, when Russ and I got
married 20 years ago,

24:55.125 --> 24:56.794
you couldn't find
two happier people,

24:56.794 --> 24:59.663
and now we can barely stand to be civil.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.154
I didn't want to make another mistake.

25:02.199 --> 25:03.834
It wasn't that you sensed
what was going on?

25:03.834 --> 25:07.404
Mike would not do
what he's being accused of.

25:07.404 --> 25:09.507
Believe me.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.340
I'll believe the DNA.

25:17.047 --> 25:18.315
Feels like blackjack, you know?

25:18.315 --> 25:21.652
You guys all fanned around the table,

25:21.652 --> 25:24.321
waiting to see which card I'll reveal next.

25:24.321 --> 25:26.090
Greg, this is an abuse case

25:26.090 --> 25:28.425
involving a minor.

25:28.425 --> 25:31.417
Right. Sorry.

25:31.996 --> 25:33.964
So, I have DNA samples from every male

25:33.964 --> 25:35.599
that lives with Jody Bradley,

25:35.599 --> 25:37.635
full-time or weekends.

25:37.635 --> 25:40.971
First, I have Mike Kimble, the fiancé

25:40.971 --> 25:42.840
Dead fiancé

25:42.840 --> 25:45.042
"Match not found."

25:45.042 --> 25:46.844
You got to be kidding me.

25:46.844 --> 25:47.678
Sorry, Captain.

25:47.678 --> 25:50.581
The guy has naked pictures of her in his

25:50.581 --> 25:52.883
The mother called off their wedding.

25:52.883 --> 25:54.718
DNA takes a pair.

25:54.718 --> 25:57.221
So whose is it, the father?

25:57.221 --> 26:00.391
"Match not found."

26:00.391 --> 26:02.256
Third and last.

26:04.528 --> 26:05.927
Give me that.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.701
How did we miss that?

26:10.701 --> 26:13.534
No. No, I never did

26:13.571 --> 26:16.540
anything like that to my sister. No.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.375
How do you explain your semen on

26:18.375 --> 26:23.005
I can't... I can't.

26:25.182 --> 26:27.484
The county automatically
provides your son

26:27.484 --> 26:28.619
with an advocate.

26:28.619 --> 26:32.214
We can't proceed
until he arrives.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.829
You getting anywhere with the print?

26:38.829 --> 26:40.998
I'm still trying
to enhance it.

26:40.998 --> 26:42.967
It's kind of frustrating,
that, uh...

26:42.967 --> 26:46.437
this picture puts us at the very moment of

26:46.437 --> 26:48.268
but we can't see
what she's seeing.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.074
They say the eyes are the window to the

26:50.074 --> 26:52.843
Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the

26:52.843 --> 26:53.777
In a way, it's true.

26:53.777 --> 26:57.581
The aqueous fluid and the
vitreous in the human eye

26:57.581 --> 27:00.417
allows for an image to be reflected in it.

27:00.417 --> 27:05.589
Well, maybe... if I enhanced the reflection in

27:05.589 --> 27:09.426
with the right combination of algorithms...

27:09.426 --> 27:13.294
I think my Popsicles are ready.

27:13.797 --> 27:16.033
Jake, did you take pictures of your sister

27:16.033 --> 27:18.636
and plant them in Mike Kimble's house?

27:18.636 --> 27:19.837
No.

27:19.837 --> 27:24.475
You do have keys
to his house, though. Right?

27:24.475 --> 27:28.946
I mean, your mother told us that both you

27:28.946 --> 27:30.981
Yes, but I didn't
plant anything.

27:30.981 --> 27:33.684
He didn't take the pictures. He didn't plant

27:33.684 --> 27:37.988
He has no idea how his DNA got in his

27:37.988 --> 27:41.583
Yeah, maybe a little hobbit put it there.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.029
That's it, we're done.

27:45.029 --> 27:46.462
All right, hold on.

27:47.064 --> 27:48.966
You mind if I talk to Jake alone?

27:48.966 --> 27:50.558
To what end?

27:52.569 --> 27:54.469
I have a hunch.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.308
Everyone does it, Jake.

27:58.308 --> 28:01.812
You just... feel like you're the only one.

28:01.812 --> 28:03.480
Then, when you don't do it,

28:03.480 --> 28:06.916
it happens in your sleep anyway, right?

28:07.885 --> 28:10.754
Yeah. And then you go to take a leak,

28:10.754 --> 28:12.222
dust off the equipment,

28:12.222 --> 28:16.556
you just grab the first thing that's handy,

28:19.296 --> 28:22.332
It was just... on the hamper.

28:22.332 --> 28:24.425
Your sister's nightgown?

28:26.804 --> 28:30.407
The next thing I know, I'm getting, like...

28:30.407 --> 28:33.043
questioned by the police

28:33.043 --> 28:34.645
and my parents are looking at me

28:34.645 --> 28:37.047
like I'm some sort of...
pervert.

28:37.047 --> 28:40.617
Yeah, that's rough. Rough.

28:40.617 --> 28:43.120
Well, listen, in the future, dude...

28:43.120 --> 28:45.422
even if the situation's
embarrassing,

28:45.422 --> 28:48.823
the truth's probably the best policy there.

28:49.660 --> 28:50.894
Yeah.

28:50.894 --> 28:53.330
Hey, listen, you
ever notice your mom's boyfriend

28:53.330 --> 28:55.199
acting weird around your sister?

28:55.199 --> 28:56.266
Like a little, uh...

28:56.266 --> 29:00.760
too friendly,
too forward?

29:02.573 --> 29:03.540
Mmm, no.

29:03.540 --> 29:08.879
No. I mean, my sister is
the one that's kind of weird.

29:08.879 --> 29:10.180
Really?
Yeah.

29:10.180 --> 29:10.781
How?

29:10.781 --> 29:12.850
She's just always just,
you know,

29:12.850 --> 29:13.884
"Mike's coming over.

29:13.884 --> 29:16.153
I can't wait
till Mike gets here."

29:16.153 --> 29:18.088
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29:18.088 --> 29:19.256
You like the guy?

29:19.256 --> 29:22.960
When, uh... my parents
were getting divorced,

29:22.960 --> 29:26.363
my mom, she cried,
like, every day,

29:26.363 --> 29:28.599
and, uh, Mike showed up

29:28.599 --> 29:30.834
and she stopped crying

29:30.834 --> 29:35.737
so, yeah. I guess.

29:52.289 --> 29:53.791
What are you doing here?

29:53.791 --> 29:54.958
Isn't this your day off?

29:54.958 --> 29:59.395
On the day you plan
to expend a meat bullet?

30:01.865 --> 30:02.900
Frozen?

30:02.900 --> 30:07.104
Yeah, I had to freeze it with
a touch of liquid nitrogen.

30:07.104 --> 30:10.096
Well, I'm ready
to watch history.

30:26.990 --> 30:30.426
Bullet-like entry wound.

30:32.396 --> 30:35.199
The meat disintegrates.

30:35.199 --> 30:38.969
Lost in
the soft tissue. Hmm.

30:38.969 --> 30:40.637
You're quite
a marksman, Russ.

30:40.637 --> 30:45.976
And inventive... you managed
to build a bullet made of meat.

30:45.976 --> 30:49.847
The meat from the projectile
was visually indistinguishable

30:49.847 --> 30:53.806
from the victim's
stomach tissue.

30:53.851 --> 30:55.819
We know that
your gun was clean

30:55.853 --> 31:00.813
but it turns out
that your reloader wasn't.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.826
Yeah. We got this from
your garage on a warrant.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.829
We figured a gun enthusiast like yourself

31:05.863 --> 31:08.024
Packs gunpowder
into used shell casings.

31:08.065 --> 31:10.863
Cheaper than buying
new rounds, right?

31:11.869 --> 31:12.903
The material that
was on your reloader

31:12.903 --> 31:15.038
is consistent with
the material we found

31:15.038 --> 31:16.907
in the victim's wound tract.

31:16.907 --> 31:19.307
Ground beef.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.579
A father knows.

31:26.617 --> 31:30.485
He was giving her gifts...
you know, cameras.

31:35.025 --> 31:37.823
He gave her a camera?

31:39.930 --> 31:43.033
And the wedding was,
like, a week off,

31:43.033 --> 31:44.768
and he was going
to be living

31:44.768 --> 31:47.204
under the same roof as
my children full-time.

31:47.204 --> 31:48.872
When I went over there,

31:48.872 --> 31:52.409
you know, I was just going
to set him straight, right?

31:52.409 --> 31:54.077
You know what he says?

31:54.077 --> 31:56.380
Hey, I can't help it
if she likes me.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.016
I guess it's like
mother, like daughter.

31:59.016 --> 32:03.921
You touch my little girl,
and I will kill you.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.322
Too late.

32:05.322 --> 32:07.057
That's when I lost it.

32:07.057 --> 32:09.726
Then you dumped him
at the body farm.

32:09.726 --> 32:14.031
Your grocery chain makes
regular meat deliveries there

32:14.031 --> 32:16.500
for experimental purposes.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.235
Then what?

32:18.235 --> 32:21.738
You arsoned his place
to cover up the murder?

32:21.738 --> 32:25.976
Grabbed the nail polish remover
from the bedside table,

32:25.976 --> 32:28.111
poured it all over the place?

32:28.111 --> 32:30.047
I'll tell you the truth.

32:30.047 --> 32:31.048
I...

32:31.048 --> 32:33.984
I feel relieved.

32:33.984 --> 32:37.387
I'd like to make
a formal confession.

32:37.387 --> 32:38.655
He can confess
to the homicide,

32:38.655 --> 32:40.891
but we're still examining
evidence in the arson.

32:40.891 --> 32:44.127
The guy wants to take the heat
for his daughter on the arson.

32:44.127 --> 32:45.629
Well, where's
the harm in that?

32:45.629 --> 32:47.898
Well, the harm would be
to the justice system

32:47.898 --> 32:49.366
unless I misunderstand
our place in it.

32:49.366 --> 32:52.202
Don't you think that little
girl's been through enough?

32:52.202 --> 32:54.271
What I think, and what
the evidence proves,

32:54.271 --> 32:58.037
are possibly
two different things.

33:02.079 --> 33:03.413
What is this?

33:03.413 --> 33:05.215
It's, uh... just what it says:

33:05.215 --> 33:07.918
It's a request
for a leave of absence...

33:07.918 --> 33:11.655
six months... year, maybe.

33:11.655 --> 33:12.522
Why?

33:12.522 --> 33:14.157
I was thinking
of checking out

33:14.157 --> 33:18.287
the federal government
system... FBI...

33:19.296 --> 33:21.865
We have the best lab
in the country.

33:21.865 --> 33:25.702
I need a different
work environment.

33:25.702 --> 33:27.170
What does
that
mean?

33:27.170 --> 33:32.309
One with, um... communication...

33:32.309 --> 33:33.744
respect.

33:33.744 --> 33:35.879
Everybody here respects you.

33:35.879 --> 33:36.613
You don't.

33:36.613 --> 33:40.984
Is this about
that hamburger thing?

33:40.984 --> 33:43.053
No. Grissom...

33:43.053 --> 33:45.555
this is not about
that hamburger thing.

33:45.555 --> 33:47.391
I-I-I don't believe you.

33:47.391 --> 33:49.860
How can you reduce
everything that I've said

33:49.860 --> 33:50.927
to some kind
of single quirk?

33:50.927 --> 33:54.556
Do you think the problem here
is just about me?

33:55.565 --> 34:00.025
If you don't sign my leave,
I'm going to have to quit.

34:05.242 --> 34:07.574
Hey, Sara?

34:11.047 --> 34:14.347
The lab needs you here.

34:16.085 --> 34:17.985
Great.

34:26.897 --> 34:28.031
Did you hear the dad

34:28.031 --> 34:29.900
copped a plea
on the murder,

34:29.900 --> 34:31.668
and the D.A.
Expedite d it?

34:31.668 --> 34:33.637
Voluntary man,
first offense.

34:33.637 --> 34:35.205
Out on bail.
Free in four.

34:35.205 --> 34:37.474
No jury was going
to convict a father

34:37.474 --> 34:39.810
for killing
his daughter's abuser.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.244
What do you have?

34:41.244 --> 34:41.978
Accelerant.

34:41.978 --> 34:44.880
Identical to the type
found at the arson.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.373
Police got it out
of Jody's gym locker.

34:57.494 --> 35:01.631
Well, looks as if Jody
was probably telling the truth.

35:01.631 --> 35:05.335
She did burn herself
on a curling iron.

35:05.335 --> 35:07.997
So who started the fire?

35:25.589 --> 35:26.323
Hey.
Hey.

35:26.323 --> 35:29.726
You get anywhere
with those fingerprints?

35:29.726 --> 35:30.360
Back burner.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.431
I've been working
on this reflection in her eye.

35:34.431 --> 35:36.666
You see
what I'm seeing?

35:36.666 --> 35:38.001
No.

35:38.001 --> 35:38.568
Come on.

35:38.568 --> 35:41.505
I've been working on this
enhancement all night.

35:41.505 --> 35:42.873
Look closer.

35:42.873 --> 35:44.141
What is it?

35:44.141 --> 35:48.544
A clock? A mirror?

35:49.980 --> 35:55.452
It's got a latch...
a lock.

35:55.452 --> 35:56.953
A porthole?

35:56.953 --> 35:59.589
It's a porthole?

35:59.589 --> 36:01.158
Yeah.

36:01.158 --> 36:05.686
These pictures
were taken on a boat.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.368
Miss Bradley.

36:11.368 --> 36:12.235
Yes.

36:12.235 --> 36:13.336
Warrick Brown.

36:13.336 --> 36:17.674
Your fiancé Mike...
did he own a boat?

36:17.674 --> 36:19.743
A boat? No.

36:19.743 --> 36:20.343
No?

36:20.343 --> 36:22.479
Did he borrow one
or rent one?

36:22.479 --> 36:25.015
He wanted to borrow
my ex-husband's boat,

36:25.015 --> 36:26.616
but he was
too proud to ask.

36:26.616 --> 36:28.385
Your ex-husband
owned a boat?

36:28.385 --> 36:31.821
He bought one
after our divorce.

36:31.821 --> 36:33.089
I've never been on it.

36:33.089 --> 36:36.252
Okay. Thank you.

37:02.319 --> 37:04.014
Jody...

37:04.554 --> 37:08.149
we know that Mike
gave you his camera.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.863
We suspect that
your father used it

37:13.863 --> 37:17.799
to take pictures
of you on his boat.

37:22.572 --> 37:23.903
We believe that

37:24.241 --> 37:26.243
he then placed
the camera back
at Mike's

37:26.243 --> 37:31.647
to implicate him,
along with the pictures.

37:32.249 --> 37:36.086
He said I was like my mom
when she was young

37:36.086 --> 37:38.221
and they were happy.

37:38.221 --> 37:44.558
He said having me was
like having his family back.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.133
Did you ever
tell your mom?

37:54.671 --> 37:57.173
I tried.

37:57.173 --> 37:58.675
I don't want to go to Dad's.

37:58.675 --> 37:59.976
You know what the judge said:

37:59.976 --> 38:01.111
Two weeks with Dad,
two with me.

38:01.111 --> 38:09.246
Jody, we have strong forensic evidence

38:10.620 --> 38:14.249
But cases like this are
very difficult to prove.

38:14.291 --> 38:17.954
A victim testifying
makes all the difference.

38:19.596 --> 38:23.333
He told me if I ever talked
he'd kill me.

38:23.333 --> 38:26.536
Jody, if you don't talk...

38:26.536 --> 38:28.738
I told Mike...

38:28.738 --> 38:31.400
and he was going to fix things.

38:37.314 --> 38:40.817
And my dad killed him...

38:40.817 --> 38:42.444
okay?

38:44.554 --> 38:47.318
Catherine.

38:50.226 --> 38:52.128
What is this?

38:52.128 --> 38:55.632
Found it on the boat.

38:55.632 --> 38:58.533
DNA just ran it.

39:00.570 --> 39:03.306
She's under 14, right?

39:03.306 --> 39:05.672
Yeah. 12.

39:16.753 --> 39:19.347
He didn't take pictures
of his daughter.

39:19.389 --> 39:20.657
He never touched her.

39:20.657 --> 39:23.326
He's a loving, devoted father
who works hard

39:23.326 --> 39:27.664
at his chain of grocery stores
to keep her in good schools.

39:27.664 --> 39:31.760
Except when she's on his boat,
right?

39:33.236 --> 39:37.307
This is your sleeping bag
we took off your boat.

39:37.307 --> 39:39.175
Our lab turned it
inside-out.

39:39.175 --> 39:40.443
The discoloration you see

39:40.443 --> 39:44.748
is a mixture of vaginal
and seminal fluid...

39:44.748 --> 39:47.876
your daughter's and yours.

39:48.952 --> 39:49.686
Okay.

39:49.686 --> 39:51.788
Don't say a word, Russ.

39:51.788 --> 39:52.622
He doesn't have to.

39:52.622 --> 39:55.955
The sleeping bag's talking
loud and clear.

39:59.062 --> 40:00.430
Brad, make me a deal.

40:00.430 --> 40:01.398
I can't.

40:01.398 --> 40:02.399
What do you mean, you can't?

40:02.399 --> 40:04.300
You got me four years
for murder.

40:04.300 --> 40:04.968
I can't.

40:04.968 --> 40:07.203
You can get me something.

40:07.203 --> 40:08.204
No, he can't.

40:08.204 --> 40:09.706
In the state of Nevada

40:09.706 --> 40:11.307
we're all bound
by a legal statute.

40:11.307 --> 40:14.708
The sexual assault of a minor
age 14 and under

40:14.778 --> 40:19.806
is a mandatory life sentence
with no possibility for parole.

40:40.770 --> 40:41.471
Excuse me.

40:41.471 --> 40:43.940
Could I talk to
you for a moment?

40:43.940 --> 40:46.676
Why don't you wait
over there, sweetie.

40:46.676 --> 40:47.377
Okay.

40:47.377 --> 40:51.047
I owe you an apology.

40:51.047 --> 40:53.316
I have an eight-year-old
daughter.

40:53.316 --> 40:54.451
It's okay.

40:54.451 --> 40:58.444
You were
looking out for mine.

41:15.872 --> 41:17.874
Tough case, huh?

41:17.874 --> 41:21.275
Just give me a straight ahead murder any

41:24.280 --> 41:28.216
Well, you wouldn't
be human if it
didn't affect you.

41:30.153 --> 41:33.714
I heard about you and Sara.

41:35.158 --> 41:39.424
Sara... you know,
she gets very emotional.

41:41.431 --> 41:44.161
Are you in denial?

41:44.501 --> 41:47.698
No, that's... no, no.
Way too analytical.

41:48.505 --> 41:51.497
Wow, you got
burned bad, huh?

41:51.841 --> 41:53.468
Welcome to the club.

41:53.510 --> 41:56.479
I got third-degree burns
from my marriage.

41:56.513 --> 41:58.948
Happens to everybody. Everybody just

41:58.948 --> 42:01.451
Good.

42:01.451 --> 42:02.852
Let's move on.

42:02.852 --> 42:04.254
But you have
to deal with it.

42:04.254 --> 42:05.955
You have to deal
with it first.

42:05.955 --> 42:07.257
You got to deal with it

42:07.257 --> 42:08.324
before it goes away.

42:08.324 --> 42:10.485
You are the supervisor.

42:10.527 --> 42:13.155
You have responsibilities,
and people are making

42:13.196 --> 42:15.187
a family around you
whether you like it not...

42:15.231 --> 42:17.495
whether you give them
permission or not.

42:18.535 --> 42:21.671
We don't have to go
to the Grand Tetons together.

42:21.671 --> 42:24.196
Just... every now and then,

42:24.240 --> 42:27.368
you got to lift your head up
out of that microscope.

42:29.579 --> 42:31.570
Yeah.

43:05.582 --> 43:09.916
Yeah, hi. I'd like to get
some flowers for a girl.

43:10.587 --> 43:12.248
No, no. Not flowers.

43:12.288 --> 43:13.915
A plant. A living plant.

43:14.023 --> 43:15.325
She likes vegetation.

43:15.325 --> 43:18.027
Yeah, that'd be fine.

43:18.027 --> 43:20.393
To a "Sara Sidle."

43:20.930 --> 43:24.889
Deliver it at the CSI Division,
Las Vegas Police Department...

43:24.934 --> 43:26.436
the one out
on North Trop Boulevard.

43:26.436 --> 43:29.606
Yeah, you can bill me
at the same place.

43:29.606 --> 43:32.175
Gil Grissom.

43:32.175 --> 43:34.210
The sentiment?

43:34.210 --> 43:37.013
Oh. Oh. On the card. Yeah.
