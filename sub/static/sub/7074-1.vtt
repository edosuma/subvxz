21:25.951 --> 21:27.475
An important lesson, my friend.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.917
You see, the tools you acquired
to survive out there

21:31.123 --> 21:32.920
will not help you here
at Greendale.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.356
What you have, my friend,
is a second chance at an honest life.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.257
Why are people trying
to teach me things

21:39.464 --> 21:43.560
at a school that has
an express tuition aisle?
Give me my keys.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.896
No, I have to keep your car
for the lesson.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.731
Don't hit me.
Please don't hit me.

21:47.939 --> 21:49.270
Jeffrey? Jeffrey?

21:49.775 --> 21:53.370
Are we cool? Are we cool?

21:54.513 --> 21:55.502
We cool.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.978
PlERCE:
I like you, Jeffrey.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.578
You remind me of myself
at your age.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.853
I deserve that.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.529
You know I've been divorced
seven times?

22:13.265 --> 22:15.790
Sometimes I think
I'm doing something wrong.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.374
You keep getting married.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.543
I never looked at it that way.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.179
Shouldn't you guys be studying?

22:31.383 --> 22:34.045
Yeah, things got
kind of boring
after you left.

22:34.319 --> 22:35.809
Let me ask you
something.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.149
People have been clowning me
about this jacket since I got here.

22:39.825 --> 22:43.226
But, if I take it off
to make them happy, that
just makes me weak, right?

22:43.428 --> 22:46.329
Listen, it doesn't matter.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.830
You lose the jacket to please them,
you keep it to piss them off.

22:50.035 --> 22:54.165
Either way, it's for them.
That's what's weak.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.265
Whoa.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.567
You just wrinkled my brain,
man.

22:59.778 --> 23:01.609
He's good, isn't he?
He's real good.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.907
Shouldn't you be rolling around
on a bed covered in test answers?

23:08.920 --> 23:12.856
I don't have any of the answers.
I'm gonna flunk the test.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.652
If you just, like,
study for an hour,
it's not that hard.

23:15.861 --> 23:17.886
You seem pretty smart.
You got a sports coat.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.724
Well, the funny thing
about being smart

23:20.932 --> 23:23.992
is you can get through most of life
without having to do work.

23:24.469 --> 23:28.371
So I'm not really sure
how to do that.

23:31.276 --> 23:32.368
[MOUTHlNG lNAUDlBLY]

23:33.979 --> 23:35.606
[MOUTHlNG]
Please? So sad?

23:37.115 --> 23:38.343
[MOUTHlNG]
He makes me wanna--

23:41.186 --> 23:43.848
What's going on?
Can you guys hear me?
Am I deaf?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.852
Can you hear me talking right now?
Yes.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.718
That's good.

23:49.561 --> 23:53.019
You know what, Jeff, actually,
we didn't get that far without you.

23:53.231 --> 23:56.564
So if you wanna come
back upstairs...

23:59.171 --> 24:00.433
Really?

24:00.639 --> 24:02.732
Well, it is your study group, so...

24:02.941 --> 24:04.909
Come on, let's study.
Sounds good.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.010
SHlRLEY: Come on.
Pressure.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.213
[THE 88'S
"DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME"
PLAYS]

24:16.955 --> 24:20.288
I'm sorry I called you
Michael Douglas.
And I see your value now.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.886
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.
