WEBVTT

00:01.872 --> 00:02.857
Sweetheart, we have to
leave after this-- we have

00:02.977 --> 00:05.097
- Christopher's music class.
- Who's Christopher?

00:05.099 --> 00:06.599
Ah, Chalupa Batman.
Oh.

00:06.601 --> 00:08.167
By the way, what's up with him?

00:08.169 --> 00:09.835
I haven't seen him in a while.
Is he talking?

00:09.837 --> 00:12.104
- Christopher is great.
- Yeah.

00:12.106 --> 00:14.206
And he's, you know...
babies are...

00:14.208 --> 00:16.207
By the way Einstein didn't
speak till he was three years

00:16.210 --> 00:18.044
- old.
- You think Einstein may

00:18.046 --> 00:19.879
have been working from better
genetic material?

00:19.881 --> 00:21.847
Or he can end up working at
Einstein's Bagels.

00:21.849 --> 00:23.883
You guys are all so smart.
What were your first words,

00:23.885 --> 00:25.885
genius?
"Poo-poo," I stand by them.

00:25.887 --> 00:27.887
It's a classic, I still use it.
I hope they're my last words.

00:27.889 --> 00:29.889
Ruxin?
I was told that my first

00:29.891 --> 00:31.891
words were "Not me."
Oh, typical corporate

00:31.893 --> 00:34.126
attorney denying responsibility
from birth.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.162
What about you, Andre?
Oh, oh, let me guess.

00:36.164 --> 00:38.664
"I want stone-washed Rock &
Republic diapers."

00:38.666 --> 00:41.801
My first word was "Amaretto."
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:41.803 --> 00:43.803
Your parents were probably
pounding the hard stuff as soon

00:43.805 --> 00:45.871
as you were born.

00:45.873 --> 00:48.541
Ruxin, can't you just lock
that dog away while we're here?

00:48.543 --> 00:50.543
Look, I don't want Kale 2.0
either, but ever since

00:50.545 --> 00:53.412
Taco brought over that canine
old folks home, Geoffrey wanted

00:53.414 --> 00:55.848
a dog.
Well, he's a creepy dog.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.017
He's a perv.
He pops a boner every time I'm

00:58.019 --> 01:00.352
around him.
It's embarrassing.

01:00.354 --> 01:02.655
It's embarrassing that he's
got such terrible taste.

01:02.657 --> 01:04.824
Hey!
Take it easy, herdsman.

01:04.825 --> 01:07.159
Hey, little pooch.

01:07.161 --> 01:09.729
Showtime.
It's mortifying, you guys.

01:09.731 --> 01:11.764
I can't even look.
It's disgusting.

01:11.766 --> 01:13.766
No lipstick.
Nothing happening.

01:13.768 --> 01:15.768
There's nothing.
>>ea Ry?

01:15.770 --> 01:18.404
Not even a pig in a blanket.
Oh, well, thank goodness

01:18.406 --> 01:20.740
'cause it's just such a relief
because it's just, it's

01:20.742 --> 01:23.209
embarrassing.
I'm happy you're such a good

01:23.211 --> 01:25.377
dog.
Yes, I am.

01:25.379 --> 01:27.379
That's right.
Use your Kathleen Turner voice

01:27.381 --> 01:29.348
on him.
You know, I am so happy that

01:29.350 --> 01:34.019
nothing is happening.
Rejected!

01:34.021 --> 01:36.422
I'm not upset about this, you
guys.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.791
If you still want him to pop
some wood, maybe you could do

01:38.793 --> 01:41.560
what you do to Kevin and express
his anal glands.

01:41.562 --> 01:44.096
That happened once.
Once?

01:44.098 --> 01:46.452
Once.
Oh, so Jenny's pinky's first

01:46.572 --> 01:47.858
word was "poo-poo," too.

01:48.247 --> 01:52.007
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:52.371 --> 01:54.206
I can't stop thinking about
that stupid dog.

01:54.208 --> 01:56.208
I mean, the lipstick didn't even
get out of the purse.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.244
It didn't even make it out of
Sephora.

01:58.246 --> 02:00.246
It's stupid.
It's really bothering me.

02:00.248 --> 02:02.448
It is, come here.
You know you and that dog

02:02.450 --> 02:04.750
have been growing apart for
quite some time now.

02:04.752 --> 02:07.052
Don't joke, Kevin.
And the dog's older and

02:07.054 --> 02:09.221
you're getting older.
What?

02:09.223 --> 02:12.091
Well, I mean, factually,
babe, you... every day are

02:12.093 --> 02:14.093
becoming one day older than the
previous day.

02:14.095 --> 02:16.729
No, I'm not actually.
You're right.

02:16.731 --> 02:19.465
Look, it's not about you.
It's about the dog.

02:19.467 --> 02:22.401
The dog has gotten so many
boners for you, he is over it.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.637
The way you get sick of having
sex with the same person

02:24.639 --> 02:26.639
eventually.
Excuse me?

02:26.641 --> 02:28.941
What? No, no!
No, no, not me.

02:28.943 --> 02:31.343
I'll have sex with you right now
to prove how interested I am in

02:31.345 --> 02:33.979
having sex with you.
Oh, the only reason you would

02:33.981 --> 02:36.448
have sex with me right now is to
prove that you are still

02:36.450 --> 02:38.818
interested in having sex with
me?

02:38.820 --> 02:40.820
Well, we just did it a couple
days ago.

02:40.822 --> 02:42.888
Good night.
I'm not a machine.

02:42.890 --> 02:46.091
Ah, I'll be ready to go in the
morning though, babe.

02:46.093 --> 02:48.994
Ow!
So what are we thinking the

02:48.996 --> 02:51.163
old first words for Chalupa are
gonna be?

02:51.165 --> 02:53.666
If it's a numbers game, it's
gonna be Mom, Dad or shitbag.

02:53.668 --> 02:55.668
Or Uncle Andre.
Uncle Andre?

02:55.670 --> 02:57.670
'Cause I'm the godfather.
Who told you that you were

02:57.672 --> 02:59.672
the godfather?
Well, you didn't say it, but

02:59.674 --> 03:01.674
I feel like I've been taking
that role.

03:01.676 --> 03:03.976
Hello.
Whoa, what the hell is that?

03:03.978 --> 03:07.780
This is Elvis.
Ellie's class cockatoo.

03:07.782 --> 03:10.683
We never discussed an Elvis.
We have a new teacher.

03:10.685 --> 03:12.785
She wants everyone to take a
turn.

03:12.787 --> 03:14.954
Wait, I'm sorry.
The school let you take home a

03:14.956 --> 03:17.189
pet after what happened to
Shakespeare the guinea pig last

03:17.191 --> 03:19.124
time?
That was an accident.

03:19.126 --> 03:22.161
Dad, you have to promise me
not to kill, cook or eat this

03:22.163 --> 03:25.998
one 'cause I love Elvis.
Yeah, who doesn't love Elvis?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.300
Um... the cage.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:28.302 --> 03:30.402
Um, is this all right?

03:30.404 --> 03:31.904
Oh, my God.
Elvis!

03:31.906 --> 03:33.906
Oh, my God!
It got me, too!

03:33.908 --> 03:35.908
And none for me.
How did you not get hit?

03:35.910 --> 03:37.910
I've never been hit.
Birds just don't find me

03:37.912 --> 03:39.912
attractive.
Huh, must've been a female

03:39.914 --> 03:41.747
bird.
I'm lucky.

03:41.749 --> 03:43.983
No, bullshit, you are due.
Yeah.

03:43.985 --> 03:46.185
There is a grand dookie drop
coming your way.

03:46.187 --> 03:48.721
It's gonna be a juggerpoop.
I've never been hit.

03:48.723 --> 03:51.056
I won't be hit.
Jesus, Taco.

03:51.058 --> 03:53.058
Taco!
I'm literally getting a

03:53.060 --> 03:55.060
contact high sitting right next
to you.

03:55.062 --> 03:56.762
I'm gonna start
charging for that.

03:56.764 --> 03:59.365
What is in the briefcase?
Well, goddamn popo's cracking

03:59.367 --> 04:02.201
down on weed again, so I'm
converting all my green assets

04:02.203 --> 04:06.071
into a safer drug currency.
It's a briefcase brownie.

04:06.073 --> 04:08.040
Whoa!
Jesus.

04:08.042 --> 04:10.509
This is easier to store, way
less suspicious and much easier

04:10.511 --> 04:13.245
to get animals high with.
Okay, great.

04:13.247 --> 04:15.247
Now I can go to the cloud
whenever I want 'cause I have

04:15.249 --> 04:18.450
the cloud with me at all times.
It's like a cloud bank.

04:18.452 --> 04:20.452
I don't think the cloud is
what you think it is.

04:20.454 --> 04:22.454
By the way, did I miss the
circle jerk?

04:22.456 --> 04:24.690
Yeah, Andre won.
Oh, good work, Andre.

04:24.692 --> 04:27.693
I didn't even know about this.

04:27.695 --> 04:31.030
Hey, CB.
Daddy found an amazing new stats

04:31.032 --> 04:34.133
Web site.
It's subscription-based so the

04:34.135 --> 04:36.535
other cockhonkers would never
spring for it.

04:36.537 --> 04:39.238
It analyzes play-calling
tendencies, strength of schedule

04:39.240 --> 04:42.441
and it will tell me the top
sleeper for the second half of

04:42.443 --> 04:44.543
the season.
So after this week's games when

04:44.545 --> 04:48.414
the waiver wire opens up, I'm
gonna pick up Isaiah Pead.

04:48.416 --> 04:51.550
Isaiah Pead, yup.

04:51.552 --> 04:55.821
Oh, Isaiah Pead, my beautiful
chocolate Jesus.

04:55.823 --> 04:58.324
- Isaiah Pead.
- No, no...

04:58.326 --> 05:00.426
Isaiah Pead.
No, no...

05:00.428 --> 05:02.628
Oh, uh...
Isaiah Pead!

05:02.630 --> 05:05.297
Oh, stop the clock!
Did he just say his first words?

05:05.299 --> 05:08.567
No, no, that was me.
That was me talking pee-pee talk

05:08.569 --> 05:10.769
to him.
Are you sure he didn't say

05:10.771 --> 05:12.771
any words?
I... He...

05:12.773 --> 05:15.274
I heard his voice.
I heard him say words.

05:15.276 --> 05:17.676
Does this smell like shit?
Oh, God, Kevin!

05:17.678 --> 05:20.012
Does it?
Oh, God, it does!

05:20.014 --> 05:22.915
Smell this.
You did that.

05:22.917 --> 05:26.752
That's a man poop.
Does this phone smell like shit?

05:26.754 --> 05:28.754
Oh, God, that's the worst
pickup line ever.

05:28.756 --> 05:30.756
Smell like shit?
Get out of my face, please.

05:30.758 --> 05:32.591
Let me, let me smell it.
Smell like shit?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.593
Ooh, yeah.
Please, smell it again.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.261
Smell it again.
All right, enough...

05:36.263 --> 05:37.930
It smells like shit.
Is anyone gonna fix the

05:37.932 --> 05:39.865
flickering light in the men's
room?

05:39.867 --> 05:41.867
It's like a goddamn Nine Inch
Nails video in there.

05:41.869 --> 05:44.136
It's gonna give me a seizure.
Relax, Taco, why don't you

05:44.138 --> 05:46.438
take another withdraw from the
cloud bank?

05:46.440 --> 05:49.108
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I don't know what it is with

05:49.110 --> 05:52.011
this thing.
It's just not doing it for me.

05:52.013 --> 05:55.814
Oh, I know why you're being a

05:55.816 --> 05:57.850
little bitch because these don't
have any reefer in them.

05:57.852 --> 05:59.852
And they skipped on the
hazelnut.

05:59.854 --> 06:02.021
Oh, God, that's why I've been
feeling so weird.

06:02.023 --> 06:04.156
I haven't felt this way since I
was a little kid.

06:04.158 --> 06:06.525
I accidently got not high.
Hey, the cloud's gone.

06:06.527 --> 06:08.527
Congratulations.
It looks like there's gonna

06:08.529 --> 06:11.330
be some clear skies for Taco.
Oh, God, what-what do I do?

06:11.332 --> 06:14.033
Do you think everyone knows I'm
not high?

06:14.035 --> 06:16.835
Everything is so clear.
I can see your pores,

06:16.837 --> 06:18.837
everything.
You guys are so ugly.

06:18.839 --> 06:20.839
Why are we even friends?
What's going on?

06:20.841 --> 06:22.841
We have nothing in common.
We're brothers.

06:22.843 --> 06:25.310
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:25.312 --> 06:28.080
No one forces me to face reality
without THC.

06:28.082 --> 06:31.817
You hear me? No one!
This shall not stand.

06:31.819 --> 06:34.553
Uh, ma'am,
you forgot your cookie.

06:34.555 --> 06:37.322
Whoa!

06:37.324 --> 06:39.158
What the hell's going on in
here?

06:39.160 --> 06:42.494
Hey, man, you're, uh...
Yeah, the guy who brought you

06:42.496 --> 06:44.763
all his weed so that you'd turn
it into a brownie and give it to

06:44.765 --> 06:46.432
me.
Yes!

06:46.434 --> 06:48.434
Yeah.
We made that brownie.

06:48.436 --> 06:52.037
And then we ate that brownie.
So you stole it from me?

06:52.039 --> 06:55.607
No, we redistributed.
Are you high?

06:55.609 --> 06:59.511
Look at that stupid grin and
your laid-back demeanor.

06:59.513 --> 07:01.713
- That's supposed to be me!
-  Look at... nothing's

07:01.715 --> 07:03.348
getting through to him.
You ever experience anything

07:03.350 --> 07:04.583
like this?
No.

07:04.585 --> 07:05.851
No.
No.

07:05.853 --> 07:07.786
Oh, what's happening right now?

07:07.788 --> 07:11.190
♪ Baked in a bakery
And I'm as stoned as hell

07:11.192 --> 07:14.126
Gonna go home early 'cause we
ate everything we sell... ♪

07:14.128 --> 07:16.395
Okay, stop it! Stop it!
No one wants to hear stupid,

07:16.397 --> 07:18.530
made-up songs.
Where the hell'd you get that

07:18.532 --> 07:20.132
guitar?
I brought it with me.

07:20.134 --> 07:21.767
You just bring a guitar to
work?

07:21.769 --> 07:23.268
Doesn't everybody?
 This is so

07:23.270 --> 07:24.903
frustrating!
It's like talking to a block of

07:24.905 --> 07:27.239
marble.

<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Hey, Jenny. You look great.</i>

08:28.205 --> 08:29.805
<i>Going out to dinner, I guess,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

08:29.807 --> 08:31.807
<i>Yeah, we have to leave early</i>
<i>enough so we can swing by</i>

08:31.809 --> 08:33.808
<i>Ruxin's.</i>
<i>I have that book for Sofia.</i>

08:33.811 --> 08:35.443
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Something's going on over</i>

08:35.446 --> 08:38.380
<i>there with that dog.</i>
<i>Right? I know. It's weird.</i>

08:38.381 --> 08:41.917
<i>This erectile conundrum is</i>
<i>quite intriguing.</i>

08:41.919 --> 08:44.251
<i>You see, dogs get boners--</i>
<i>that's what they do.</i>

08:44.254 --> 08:46.988
<i>And if he's not getting boners</i>
<i>for you, he's getting boners for</i>

08:46.990 --> 08:50.959
<i>someone or something else.</i>
<i>Now, if you'll humor me for a</i>

08:50.961 --> 08:56.098
<i>second, I came up with a law,</i>
<i>conservation of boners.</i>

08:56.100 --> 08:59.167
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>You see, there's a finite</i>

08:59.169 --> 09:04.106
<i>amount of boner energy, or</i>
<i>"bonergy," in the universe.</i>

09:04.108 --> 09:07.609
<i>Now, boners cannot be created or</i>
<i>destroyed.</i>

09:07.611 --> 09:10.178
<i>Oh, boners can be destroyed.</i>
<i>In the bedroom, yes, but not</i>

09:10.180 --> 09:13.482
<i>in theoretical physics.</i>
<i>Now, my theory is that the</i>

09:13.484 --> 09:20.021
<i>missing doggy boners are being</i>
<i>transformed into other boners.</i>

09:20.023 --> 09:23.325
<i>So, wait, I am turning on</i>
<i>other animals now and they're</i>

09:23.327 --> 09:26.294
<i>getting boners for me?</i>
<i>Transmigration of boners?</i>

09:26.296 --> 09:28.930
<i>No, no, no. See, that was</i>
<i>debunked a long time ago.</i>

09:28.932 --> 09:32.134
<i>The science just isn't there.</i>
<i>Boners cannot teleport.</i>

09:32.136 --> 09:34.269
<i>They can only move in one</i>
<i>continuous flow of blood to</i>

09:34.271 --> 09:37.606
<i>dongers.</i>
<i>I mean, where would those boners</i>

09:37.608 --> 09:39.641
<i>be going?</i>
<i>To Kevin? Nah, that dick's</i>

09:39.643 --> 09:41.510
<i>deader than disco.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

09:41.512 --> 09:43.145
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>Is he tying a stick to it</i>

09:43.147 --> 09:46.348
<i>yet?</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

09:46.350 --> 09:49.284
<i>Oh, look, it's the prostitute</i>
<i>my dog ordered.</i>

09:49.286 --> 09:51.953
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

09:51.955 --> 09:53.955
<i>See, Kevin and I...</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

09:53.957 --> 09:56.124
<i>...we were just on our way to</i>
<i>dinner, and I thought it would</i>

09:56.126 --> 09:58.126
<i>be a great opportunity to return</i>
<i>the book that I borrowed from</i>

09:58.128 --> 10:00.996
<i>Sofia.</i>
<i>Well, Sofia's not here, and</i>

10:00.998 --> 10:03.965
<i>she barely likes reading menus.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

10:03.967 --> 10:07.002
<i>Just go get the goddamn dog,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

10:07.004 --> 10:10.305
<i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>Oh, Kale, your dog streetwalker</i>

10:10.307 --> 10:12.707
<i>has arrived.</i>
<i>Come here, babe.</i>

10:12.709 --> 10:15.043
<i>Well, there he is.</i>

10:15.045 --> 10:17.479
<i>Handsome devil.</i>
<i>You come here.</i>

10:17.481 --> 10:20.582
<i>Oh, does that feel good?</i>
<i>I think he can sense that</i>

10:20.584 --> 10:22.584
<i>you're not wearing underwear.</i>
<i>Oh, do you like it when I do</i>

10:22.586 --> 10:24.886
<i>that?</i>
<i>You want me to do it a little</i>

10:24.888 --> 10:27.322
<i>harder, a little faster?</i>
<i>This is a low point, not only</i>

10:27.324 --> 10:30.826
<i>for you but I think for the dog</i>
<i>as well.</i>

10:30.828 --> 10:33.395
<i>Not that into it, huh?</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

10:33.397 --> 10:35.697
<i>I don't know what you did to</i>
<i>this poor dog.</i>

10:35.699 --> 10:37.999
<i>Is he drunk?</i>
<i>Yeah, he's into Bordeaux now.</i>

10:38.001 --> 10:40.001
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Yeah, he's a Bor-dog.</i>

10:40.003 --> 10:42.003
<i>He's not so much into wine</i>
<i>coolers.</i>

10:42.005 --> 10:44.573
<i>I am not a wine cooler, okay,</i>
<i>buddy?</i>

10:44.575 --> 10:46.575
<i>At the very least, I am a</i>
<i>top-shelf boxed wine.</i>

10:46.577 --> 10:48.577
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>We're leaving. Grab my coat.</i>

10:48.579 --> 10:50.745
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Later, Franzia.</i>

10:50.747 --> 10:53.915
<i>My streak was almost broken,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

10:53.917 --> 10:56.451
<i>I leave my work. I see a bird.</i>
<i>Boom, we lock eyes.</i>

10:56.453 --> 10:58.453
<i>I start walking quick 'cause I</i>
<i>don't want to get shit on,</i>

10:58.455 --> 11:00.088
<i>right?</i>
<i>And then I get to my car, try to</i>

11:00.090 --> 11:02.090
<i>get the door open, get inside,</i>
<i>slam the door and what happens?</i>

11:02.092 --> 11:04.092
<i>Shit right on the windshield.</i>
<i>It's a near-dookie</i>

11:04.094 --> 11:05.927
<i>experience.</i>
<i>It means your next time you</i>

11:05.929 --> 11:07.929
<i>won't be so lucky.</i>
<i>You're not getting in my</i>

11:07.931 --> 11:09.865
<i>head anymore.</i>
<i>You think you're so cool.</i>

11:09.867 --> 11:12.367
<i>You're like a low-rent frittata</i>
<i>Keyser Soze.</i>

11:12.369 --> 11:14.369
<i>I like it. I'll take it.</i>
<i>That's you.</i>

11:14.371 --> 11:15.971
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Hello, gentlemen.</i>

11:15.973 --> 11:18.807
<i>Oh, Pete, ah, it looks like</i>
<i>we're matched up this week.</i>

11:18.809 --> 11:21.142
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>This week is my Taco-bye.</i>

11:21.144 --> 11:23.144
<i>I'll tell you what, I will start</i>
<i>three kickers if you start three</i>

11:23.146 --> 11:26.381
<i>kickers.</i>
<i> Oh, that's funny.</i>

11:26.383 --> 11:28.416
<i>You know what else is funny?</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

11:28.418 --> 11:30.485
<i>When I stopped smoking, not</i>
<i>only did my knowledge of the</i>

11:30.487 --> 11:33.121
<i>French language come back but</i>
<i>my love of all things football</i>

11:33.123 --> 11:35.323
<i>as well, mm-hmm.</i>
<i>What?</i>

11:35.325 --> 11:37.325
<i>If you think I'm gonna be</i>
<i>playing Chris Johnson at</i>

11:37.327 --> 11:40.228
<i>Seattle, you're sadly mistaken.</i>
<i>No, the Seahawks, dude, they</i>

11:40.230 --> 11:42.230
<i>take it to the next level with</i>
<i>the 12th Man.</i>

11:42.232 --> 11:44.232
<i>However, I will be calling up</i>
<i>the Law Firm.</i>

11:44.234 --> 11:46.234
<i>How do you know what the Law</i>
<i>Firm...</i>

11:46.236 --> 11:48.303
<i>BenJarvus Green-Ellis?</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah. I like him for at</i>

11:48.305 --> 11:50.772
<i>least one short TD against the</i>
<i>Bills, maybe two.</i>

11:50.774 --> 11:53.141
<i>I also have a good friend by the</i>
<i>name of Jimmy Graham.</i>

11:53.143 --> 11:55.143
<i>Yeah, the Saints in a</i>
<i>high-scoring game against the</i>

11:55.145 --> 11:57.245
<i>Patriots?</i>
<i>Sky's the limit.</i>

11:57.247 --> 12:00.115
<i>As for kickers, I'm gonna play</i>
<i>only one, thank you, and I'm</i>

12:00.117 --> 12:02.617
<i>thinking Matt Prater.</i>
<i>So that every time your Peyton</i>

12:02.619 --> 12:06.021
<i>Manning scores, this guy gets a</i>
<i>point as well.</i>

12:06.023 --> 12:08.089
<i>You might want to stretch your</i>
<i>jaw, Pete, 'cause you're gonna</i>

12:08.091 --> 12:10.091
<i>eat a lot of shit this week.</i>

12:10.093 --> 12:12.093
<i>What?</i>

12:12.095 --> 12:13.795
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>That is not fair.</i>

12:13.797 --> 12:15.797
<i>Everybody else got their</i>
<i>Taco-bye.</i>

12:15.799 --> 12:17.799
<i>I want my win this week!</i>
<i>Aw...</i>

12:17.801 --> 12:20.702
<i>I was counting on this</i>
<i>victory to get me up to 500.</i>

12:20.704 --> 12:23.204
<i>You're scared.</i>
<i>A smart and sober Taco is a</i>

12:23.206 --> 12:26.007
<i>detriment to the league.</i>
<i>We have to get up on that wagon,</i>

12:26.009 --> 12:28.443
<i>and we have to knock his ass</i>
<i>off.</i>

12:28.445 --> 12:32.380
<i>We did it once before, remember?</i>
<i>Okay, Pete, I stole the weed</i>

12:32.382 --> 12:34.816
<i>from my parents.</i>
<i>Now can I be in the group?</i>

12:34.818 --> 12:37.218
<i>We'll see, Andre.</i>
<i>Bring us a picture of your</i>

12:37.220 --> 12:39.821
<i>sister naked.</i>
<i>Then we'll talk.</i>

12:39.823 --> 12:41.957
<i>Hey, Kevin, Mom's gonna get</i>
<i>mad at you for missing piano</i>

12:41.959 --> 12:44.392
<i>lessons.</i>
<i>My brother's such a geek.</i>

12:44.394 --> 12:46.528
<i>Stop it.</i>

12:46.530 --> 12:48.697
<i>Let's get him high.</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

12:48.699 --> 12:51.466
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>No...</i>

12:51.468 --> 12:56.004
<i>Hmm, interesting.</i>

12:56.006 --> 12:59.641
<i>Dude, he's so high he doesn't</i>
<i>even remember his own name.</i>

12:59.643 --> 13:01.977
<i>Do you remember what your name</i>
<i>is?</i>

13:01.979 --> 13:06.014
<i>Taco.</i>
<i>My name is Taco.</i>

13:06.016 --> 13:09.551
<i>No way. Taco.</i>
<i>On that day, Taco was born.</i>

13:09.553 --> 13:13.388
<i>Now, I decree we must re-stone</i>
<i>him.</i>

13:13.390 --> 13:16.891
<i>As commissioner, I say no to</i>
<i>re-stoning my brother.</i>

13:16.893 --> 13:19.661
<i>He may actually end up being a</i>
<i>functional member of society,</i>

13:19.663 --> 13:21.663
<i>perhaps even starting a family.</i>
<i>Look at him.</i>

13:21.665 --> 13:23.264
<i>Hi there.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

13:23.266 --> 13:25.767
<i>You are very attractive.</i>
<i>Would you like to have sexual</i>

13:25.769 --> 13:27.769
<i>intercourse with me in the</i>
<i>bathroom?</i>

13:27.771 --> 13:29.771
<i>No.</i>
<i>In the ladies' room?</i>

13:29.773 --> 13:31.906
<i>Dude, I'm sorry. I'm just...</i>
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

13:31.908 --> 13:33.875
<i>I mean, honestly, why would</i>
<i>you be?</i>

13:33.877 --> 13:36.778
<i>I have no visible means of</i>
<i>support, I wear clothes I find</i>

13:36.780 --> 13:39.381
<i>on buses and I comb my hair with</i>
<i>a fork.</i>

13:39.383 --> 13:41.082
<i>Ew, you're just gross.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:41.084 --> 13:43.084
<i>Go find someone who deserves</i>
<i>you!</i>

13:43.086 --> 13:44.719
<i>Maybe not the family part yet.</i>

13:44.721 --> 13:46.888
<i>Guys, I just realized... I am</i>
<i>not a catch.</i>

13:46.890 --> 13:48.890
<i>Taco Corp? It's a joke.</i>
<i>Don't forget about the pee</i>

13:48.892 --> 13:50.792
<i>bibs.</i>
<i>Pee bib?</i>

13:50.794 --> 13:52.727
<i>It's a goddamn napkin.</i>

13:53.743 --> 13:57.890
All right, CB, these are
your last moments with Elvis.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.597
He's going to bed, so that means
you have to go to bed.

14:00.599 --> 14:02.966
Isaiah Pead.
No, no, stop saying, "Isaiah

14:02.968 --> 14:05.402
Pead."
It's important that Dada gets

14:05.404 --> 14:08.005
Isaiah Pead and not Mama.
Isaiah Pead.

14:08.007 --> 14:10.440
Stop saying, "Isaiah Pead."
I'm Papa.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.810
Papa.
Good job, CB!

14:12.812 --> 14:14.978
Isaiah Pead!
Ball sack! Not you!

14:14.980 --> 14:16.980
Isaiah Pead! Isaiah Pead!
Stop saying Isaiah Pead.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.982
Isaiah Pead. Isaiah Pead.
I'm home!

14:18.984 --> 14:21.185
Oh.
Hello? Got the groceries.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.187
Isaiah Pead.
Isaiah Pead! Isaiah Pead.

14:23.189 --> 14:25.422
Stop saying that.
Isaiah...

14:25.424 --> 14:27.424
Oh, my God!
Hello?

14:27.426 --> 14:29.426
Isaiah Pead. Isaiah Pead.
Isaiah Pead.

14:29.428 --> 14:31.428
No, no. No Isaiah Pead.
Jenny's home.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.430
Okay. I have them all myself.
Isaiah Pead. Isaiah Pead.

14:33.432 --> 14:35.432
Hey, stop it! Let go!
Get back! Oh! Go! God. Oh!

14:35.434 --> 14:37.634
- Isaiah Pead.
-  Isaiah Pead.

14:37.636 --> 14:40.370
Shut up, you shit sipper!
Isaiah...

14:40.372 --> 14:42.606
Oh, Elvis! Oh, no!

14:42.608 --> 14:45.008
Isaiah Pead.
Oh, Elvis.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.444
Looks like the toilet bowl got
you twice.

14:47.446 --> 14:49.847
Kevin?
Oh, uh...

14:49.849 --> 14:52.182
Kevin?
Isaiah...

14:52.184 --> 14:54.618
Pead...

14:54.620 --> 14:56.987
Jenny, I'm surprised you're

14:56.989 --> 14:59.189
rockin' the sweats.
You just gave up completely on

14:59.191 --> 15:01.191
getting the Kale boner?
Oh, you know, what's the

15:01.193 --> 15:03.393
point?
Yeah, that's the only reason

15:03.395 --> 15:05.896
to look pretty-- the dog.
Where's PBS on this thing?

15:05.898 --> 15:08.298
Whoa, that is not PBS.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.701
That is <i>Red Shoe</i> something...

15:10.703 --> 15:13.737
Oh!

15:13.739 --> 15:16.173
Oh, there it is.
The bone zone.

15:16.175 --> 15:18.375
Now, that's the good good.
Oh, shut up.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.577
Stop doing that.
There you have it-- a doggie

15:20.579 --> 15:22.813
erection.
Okay, so, Jenny no longer

15:22.815 --> 15:25.249
produces canus erectus, but
scantily-clad women torturing

15:25.251 --> 15:27.684
each other does.
Fascinating.

15:27.686 --> 15:30.053
Kale, get off the table.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.055
It's as if he's be
desensitized to normal human

15:32.057 --> 15:34.258
women and now can only be
aroused by women in violent

15:34.260 --> 15:36.493
situations.
That's a stretch, Taco, all

15:36.495 --> 15:38.695
right?
That's ridiculous.

15:38.697 --> 15:40.697
It is, but not impossible.
Why do you think this is the

15:40.699 --> 15:43.066
case, Ruxin?
That only young, pert she-whores

15:43.068 --> 15:45.502
now inflame your pet, when
Jenny, in the rattiest of Old

15:45.504 --> 15:47.905
Navy irregular sale items, used
to do it for him?

15:47.907 --> 15:50.274
Hmm?
I'm not sure.

15:50.276 --> 15:52.276
I'll think about it while I'm
getting you guys some more

15:52.278 --> 15:54.511
beers, or...
Hmm. Oh, they're okay.

15:54.513 --> 15:56.513
They have plenty of beers.
Now, if we use the principals of

15:56.515 --> 15:58.515
deduction, I'm sure we can get
to the bottom of this.

15:58.517 --> 16:00.517
Okay, you guys do that while
I take my dog for a walk.

16:00.519 --> 16:02.920
See you.
A walk? Of course!

16:02.922 --> 16:05.289
I know where the boners have
gone.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.724
All right, if you're gonna
drop a steamer, do it in the

16:07.726 --> 16:10.727
bushes, all right, buddy?
As Ruxin was so kind to

16:10.729 --> 16:14.097
remind us, he's been taking his
dog for longer walks recently.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.434
I think the coast is clear,
Kale.

16:17.436 --> 16:21.204
And we all know Sofia's
strict, no-porn policy.

16:21.206 --> 16:23.607
Yeah, there's such a plethora
of free sites now.

16:23.609 --> 16:26.276
Look at this.
These girls are sisters.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.745
They fight a lot, but they
actually love each other.

16:28.747 --> 16:30.948
Oh!
So, I submit that Ruxin has

16:30.950 --> 16:34.618
been watching pornography on his
cell phone during his dog walks.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.054
Balderdash!
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

16:37.056 --> 16:40.223
We all know Ruxin's favorite
porn subgenres are girl-on-girl

16:40.225 --> 16:43.060
and bondage.
Aah!

16:43.062 --> 16:45.629
Ew.
And the little doggie started

16:45.631 --> 16:47.931
watching the pornography with
his master.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.300
I was hoping for a little
more interracial stuff, but all

16:50.302 --> 16:52.669
right.

16:52.671 --> 16:54.671
Hey, Kale, you're drilling a
hole through my leg, buddy.

16:54.673 --> 16:56.907
Come on.
And thus the case of the

16:56.909 --> 16:59.276
missing dog erections is closed.
That actually kind of holds

16:59.278 --> 17:01.678
water.
That makes sense.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.747
You're like the Hard-on Boys.
Goddamn it, Taco, you idiot,

17:03.749 --> 17:05.749
genius, frittata, busybody!
You think you're so smart.

17:05.751 --> 17:07.951
A sneer is the weapon of the
weak.

17:07.953 --> 17:10.319
What?
Huh?

17:10.321 --> 17:12.521
Huh?
James Russell Lowell.

17:12.523 --> 17:15.258
Look him up.
Ooh, there's a volume eight.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.661
We need to re-high him.
Yeah.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.963
Hope you have your
prescription pad, Andre, 'cause

17:19.964 --> 17:23.103
we need some medical-grade shit.
Hey,

17:23.223 --> 17:24.018
I got the drugs.

17:24.137 --> 17:25.696
- Andre, wait wait wait.
- What?

17:27.556 --> 17:31.693
Oh, yes, oh, you are gonna get it,
oh your time has come.

17:31.813 --> 17:33.919
- No, no, some more time.
- Oh, really?

17:34.039 --> 17:35.777
Andre, just throw me the bag, okay?

17:37.518 --> 17:40.171
Just go gracefully, Andre.
You've had your time.

17:40.291 --> 17:41.423
No, no, no. Give me your jacket.

17:41.543 --> 17:42.348
Just throw me the drugs
so we can save them.

17:42.368 --> 17:43.898
Throw me your jacket, and
I'll throw you the bag.

17:44.018 --> 17:45.675
Hell, no!
You think you're so smart.

17:45.795 --> 17:47.273
I'm the smart one. Watch this.

17:47.393 --> 17:49.393
Are you going back draft?

17:57.970 --> 18:00.337
Look, look.
Nothing, not at all.

18:00.339 --> 18:03.006
Unbelievable.
Hear that birds? Ha, ha!

18:03.008 --> 18:05.375
Oh.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.811
Thanks, Andre. Are you okay?

18:07.813 --> 18:12.182
Oh, Andre, judgment day. Uh-oh!

18:12.184 --> 18:16.486
Oh, that's the juggerpoop!

18:16.488 --> 18:18.889
Help me! Help me!
You are literally a shit

18:18.891 --> 18:21.258
sipper.
I'm not touching you.

18:23.695 --> 18:26.096
I don't know much about pop
culture, 'cause I don't own a

18:26.098 --> 18:28.265
television.
Oh, my God, I don't own a

18:28.267 --> 18:30.500
television.
I love talking to other

18:30.502 --> 18:32.736
people who don't own televisions
about not owning a television.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.905
I love talking to people that
<i>do</i> have televisions about how I

18:34.907 --> 18:36.907
<i>don't</i> own a television.

18:36.909 --> 18:38.909
I love talking to people who
don't own televisions <i>around</i>

18:38.911 --> 18:41.111
<i>people who own televisions.</i>
<i>Oh, hey, guys.</i>

18:41.113 --> 18:43.280
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>What's going on? Hey!</i>

18:43.282 --> 18:45.282
<i>Put me down, will you?!</i>
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

18:45.284 --> 18:47.551
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Put me down!</i>

18:47.553 --> 18:49.419
<i>Hit it!</i>
<i>Go, go, go, go, go, go!</i>

18:49.421 --> 18:51.421
<i>You stay down!</i>

18:51.423 --> 18:53.423
<i>What's going on</i>
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

18:53.425 --> 18:55.425
<i>Let go of me!</i>
<i>Okay, we're clear!</i>

18:55.427 --> 18:57.527
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>All right.</i>

18:57.529 --> 18:59.729
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>

18:59.731 --> 19:01.932
<i>No, no, no, no, no, I don't want</i>
<i>to go to dehab.</i>

19:01.934 --> 19:03.934
<i>We don't want to send you,</i>
<i>buddy, but we think it's best</i>

19:03.936 --> 19:06.303
<i>for everyone.</i>
<i>No.</i>

19:06.305 --> 19:08.405
<i>Except for you.</i>
<i>I'm reading The Corrections.</i>

19:08.407 --> 19:10.407
<i>I have to finish it!</i>
<i>I don't know how it ends!</i>

19:10.409 --> 19:12.609
<i>Please!</i>
<i>It's super depressing.</i>

19:12.611 --> 19:14.811
<i>Light 'em up, boys.</i>
<i>No!</i>

19:14.813 --> 19:17.047
<i>An apple a day keeps Smart</i>
<i>Taco away.</i>

19:17.049 --> 19:20.083
<i>No!</i>
<i>Let go of me! No! Please!</i>

19:20.085 --> 19:24.221
<i>Drop it in!</i>

19:24.223 --> 19:26.623
<i>Is he dead?</i>

19:26.625 --> 19:31.261
<i>Is he dumb?</i>
<i>Oh, hey, guys.</i>

19:31.263 --> 19:33.663
<i>Hey, Ruspin.</i>
<i>Hi, Taco.</i>

19:33.665 --> 19:35.966
<i>Welcome home.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

19:35.968 --> 19:39.503
<i>Those are really cool hats.</i>

19:40.372 --> 19:44.119
Waiver wire is open.
Isaiah Pead, please.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.675
Isaiah Pead.

19:46.677 --> 19:49.044
What's that?

19:49.046 --> 19:51.513
Isaiah Pead.
Hello?

19:51.515 --> 19:53.949
Isaiah Pead.
Hello? Hello?

19:53.951 --> 19:56.318
Oh!

19:56.320 --> 19:58.720
Isaiah Pead!

19:58.722 --> 20:02.157
Die, devil bird, die!
Isaiah Pead! Pead! Pead!

20:02.159 --> 20:04.526
Isaiah Pead!

20:04.528 --> 20:06.728

20:06.730 --> 20:09.097
Oh.

20:09.099 --> 20:11.333
What is going on in here?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.535
Elvis?
Isaiah Pead. Isaiah Pead.

20:13.537 --> 20:15.938
Isaiah Pead?

20:15.940 --> 20:18.340
Isaiah Pead.
It's a really good idea,

20:18.342 --> 20:20.575
actually.
Okay, Lady MacArthur's adding

20:20.577 --> 20:23.011
Isaiah Pead.
Isaiah Pead.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.414
Boom. High five, dude.
Hello.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.849
Yeah.
Oh, no, no!

20:27.851 --> 20:30.570
Elvis, why can't you stay dead,
you shitbag, bird?

20:30.690 --> 20:33.088
Shitbag. Shitbag.

Wow. Great first word.
