00:05.096 --> 00:07.054
I think you have a real future
in the religious markets.

00:07.138 --> 00:07.722
Really?

00:08.263 --> 00:09.888
I loved that Jesus raised
Lazarus from the dead.

00:09.971 --> 00:11.054
Maybe Lazarus wanted to be dead.

00:11.388 --> 00:13.888
Can you imagine if Jesus raised
him and Lazarus came up like...

00:14.971 --> 00:17.763
-"Oh, man!"
-(LAUGHTER)

00:18.430 --> 00:20.346
Ali did stand-up on Seth Meyers.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.096
Some comics are gonna
get together and watch.

00:22.179 --> 00:23.096
-And like--
-(SHUSHING)

00:23.555 --> 00:24.555
ALI REISSEN: (ON TV) They're
like, "Uh, you're glowing.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.597
-I'm like, "Well...
-Do not shush me.

00:27.471 --> 00:29.471
Stop it! Tonight was about Ali.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.555
I'll let you go--
go back to her.

00:31.638 --> 00:33.680
-You're a shitty boyfriend.
-Okay.

00:33.763 --> 00:35.680
And you're
an even shittier comic.

00:36.263 --> 00:38.221
Kat and I just had
a really big fight.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.555
I really am sorry.

I was watching a James Bond
movie recently,

01:47.722 --> 01:50.555
and James Bond had his gun
pointed at the bad guy, right?

01:50.638 --> 01:51.929
He had him in the corner.

01:52.013 --> 01:54.513
And the bad guy had
one last line, and he goes,

01:54.597 --> 01:56.096
"See you in Hell!"

01:56.179 --> 01:57.763
-(laughter)
-And James Bond,
he's always

01:57.847 --> 01:59.430
supposed to have
a good retort, right?

01:59.513 --> 02:01.430
And he goes, "You first."

02:01.513 --> 02:03.346
(laughter)

02:06.221 --> 02:08.388
Uh... Is that a good comeback?

02:08.471 --> 02:10.722
(laughter)

02:13.305 --> 02:16.096
James Bond is going to Hell?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.971
And knows he's going to Hell?

02:19.054 --> 02:21.054
And isn't concerned?

02:21.138 --> 02:22.971
He's just like, "Yeah,

02:23.054 --> 02:27.096
but you'll be there
a little bit before I'm there."

02:27.179 --> 02:28.805
(laughter)

02:28.888 --> 02:31.722
It's not a good comeback.
He should be like,
"See you in Hell!"

02:31.805 --> 02:33.971
James Bond
should be like, "No!"

02:34.054 --> 02:36.263
(laughter)

02:36.346 --> 02:37.971
"Uh-uh!

02:38.471 --> 02:41.096
I have the love of Jesus
in my h-e-a-r-t!"

02:41.179 --> 02:43.221
Bang!
That's a better comeback.

02:43.305 --> 02:45.054
(cheers and applause)

02:48.888 --> 02:50.305
How pissed would you be

02:50.388 --> 02:52.971
if you were murdered
and went to Hell

02:53.054 --> 02:55.388
and saw the guy
who murdered you?

02:56.013 --> 02:57.513
You're down there forever,
and you're like,

02:57.597 --> 03:00.013
"Yeah, I was a bad guy,
but another guy--

03:00.096 --> 03:03.054
actually that guy right
over there, he shot me.

03:03.138 --> 03:04.138
(laughter)

03:04.221 --> 03:06.096
Hi! Remember me?

03:06.847 --> 03:08.263
You shot me!

03:08.346 --> 03:11.263
Yeah... (laughs),
but here we are.

03:11.346 --> 03:15.138
-(laughter)
-Together again."

03:15.221 --> 03:17.263
You guys were amazing.
Thank you so much.

03:17.346 --> 03:18.388
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

03:18.471 --> 03:20.388
-Yeah, have
a good night.
-Bye.

03:20.971 --> 03:22.597
Pete. Pete.

03:29.096 --> 03:31.513
-Hey. Great show.
-Hey. Thank you.

03:31.597 --> 03:33.680
Marcie, this
has been amazing.

03:33.763 --> 03:35.346
Some of the best crowds
I've ever had in my life,

03:35.430 --> 03:38.680
and I'm signing autographs
like Kevin James did at TCBY.

03:38.763 --> 03:40.680
-Well, everybody loves you.
-Thank you.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.763
How do you feel
about doing morning
radio tomorrow?

03:44.805 --> 03:46.179
-Really? Just me?
-Yes!

03:46.263 --> 03:49.054
We need somebody
with the gift of gab,
and that's you.

03:49.138 --> 03:51.555
Marcie, I would love
to do morning--

03:51.638 --> 03:52.805
That's my first
morning radio.

03:52.888 --> 03:55.722
Cool! Oh, um,
I was just wondering

03:55.805 --> 03:58.138
if you'd had a chance
to look at your contract.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.263
I signed it, yeah.
Did you get it?

04:00.346 --> 04:02.805
My manager's kind of--
he's not great.

04:02.888 --> 04:06.388
Well, I'm sure it was
just a slip of the tongue,

04:06.471 --> 04:09.471
but you said "pissed"
on stage tonight.

04:10.221 --> 04:11.638
-I did?
-Yeah.

04:12.305 --> 04:13.888
-You're absolutely--
Yeah...
-Yeah.

04:13.971 --> 04:15.888
...I did not mean to do that.
Is that something I shouldn't--

04:15.971 --> 04:17.013
I shouldn't do that?

04:17.096 --> 04:19.388
No, no. It's a bodily
function, yeah,

04:19.471 --> 04:21.763
so, you know,
it's in that contract.

04:21.847 --> 04:24.346
Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry.
I'll read the contract,

04:24.430 --> 04:26.847
but I don't normally do jokes
like that, so that was just--

04:26.929 --> 04:28.847
Yeah. No, that's great.
Okay, good. Thank you.

04:28.929 --> 04:30.430
And you know what?
Everybody loves it

04:30.513 --> 04:31.929
when you talk
about your faith.

04:32.013 --> 04:34.013
So talk about
my faith more?

04:34.096 --> 04:36.471
Yes, yes. We love it when
you talk about your faith.

04:36.555 --> 04:37.888
You should stick
with that.

04:37.971 --> 04:40.430
Yeah.
I-- I wanna make sure
I'm giving them the show

04:40.513 --> 04:42.263
-that they want
to see, and--
-Right.

04:42.346 --> 04:44.054
Well, I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

04:44.138 --> 04:46.888
-I'm so excited. Thank you.
-Okay? Get some shut-eye.

04:46.971 --> 04:48.763
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go
to bed right now.

04:48.847 --> 04:51.013
(laughing)
You might have some
more autographs.

04:51.096 --> 04:52.305
I see people lining up.

04:52.388 --> 04:53.763
Thank you, Marcie.
Sorry again!

04:53.847 --> 04:55.430
That's all right.
Just keep to it.

04:55.513 --> 04:56.805
-Okay.
-Good night.

04:59.929 --> 05:01.597
But as you know...

05:01.680 --> 05:05.179
our Lord and Savior
was crucified and buried,

05:05.263 --> 05:07.555
and on the third day...

05:07.638 --> 05:10.305
-Oh! Oh! (laughs)
-...He rose.

05:10.388 --> 05:11.722
You can pass
your finger around

05:11.805 --> 05:13.346
and make sure there's
no threads or anything.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.888
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:15.722 --> 05:18.138
(laughter)

05:18.221 --> 05:19.763
Kat (over phone):
Are you fucking
kidding me?

05:19.847 --> 05:21.054
You can't text
a break-up.

05:21.138 --> 05:22.680
I said,
"We need to talk."

05:22.763 --> 05:25.013
"We need to talk" is
I'm going to break up
with you,

05:25.096 --> 05:28.054
and then you
beat me to it with
this fucking text?

05:28.138 --> 05:30.346
What kind
of limp-dick fuck
would do that?

05:32.430 --> 05:34.054
You all right
down there?

05:35.388 --> 05:37.096
(sighing):
Yeah.

05:38.888 --> 05:41.179
Though I think I just
broke up with my girlfriend.

05:41.263 --> 05:43.555
Yeah, man, I hear that.

05:44.722 --> 05:46.388
Which is weird
'cause, I mean, I was...

05:46.471 --> 05:48.597
I was crazy about her.

05:49.138 --> 05:51.971
Now I feel like I was dating
someone I didn't even know.

05:52.054 --> 05:52.971
John:
Hmm.

05:53.054 --> 05:54.597
You ever break up
with somebody

05:54.680 --> 05:56.096
and then you figure out
who they are?

05:56.179 --> 05:58.805
(laughing):
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

05:58.888 --> 06:00.346
But as long as you
know who you are

06:00.430 --> 06:03.179
and that relationship got you
closer to figuring that out,

06:03.263 --> 06:04.805
then you're good.

06:04.888 --> 06:06.388
You know, sometimes
we don't know what...

06:06.471 --> 06:08.805
what's going on, but God does.

06:11.263 --> 06:12.388
Yeah.

06:14.054 --> 06:16.179
Cindy (on radio):
So Lester,
lots of news today.

06:16.263 --> 06:18.847
A Mexican restaurant
caught fire the other day.

06:18.929 --> 06:20.971
Lester:
Would you describe it
as a mild fire?

06:21.054 --> 06:23.054
Cindy:
Weird, I thought
it would be chili.

06:23.138 --> 06:25.555
Lester: Ah! They really
need to cool it with
those habaneros.

06:25.638 --> 06:26.888
Hey, careful,
that plate's hot!

06:26.971 --> 06:29.179
I just don't know
what I'm going to say.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.388
Oh, just go in there
and let your light shine.

06:32.471 --> 06:33.763
I can do that.

06:33.847 --> 06:35.388
-Yeah?
-I can.

06:35.471 --> 06:37.096
-Pete?
-Yes.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.847
-They're ready for you.
-Great.

06:38.929 --> 06:40.054
You stay here.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.680
I'll stay here and listen.
I'm so excited.

06:42.763 --> 06:44.888
-Okay, like my mom
at the dentist. Love you.
-(laughs): Yeah.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.013
Lester:
I had the biggest poop
the other day.

06:47.096 --> 06:49.305
I swear, it looked
like the letter Q.

06:50.513 --> 06:52.430
-This is Pete Holmes.
-Oh hi, Pete.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.555
-Oh, hey.
-Hello.

06:53.638 --> 06:54.722
Hey, I'm Lester.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.221
Cool, nice to meet you.

06:56.305 --> 06:57.888
-This is Cindy.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

06:57.971 --> 06:59.555
That's you in that
chair, right there.

06:59.638 --> 07:00.722
Have a seat.

07:00.805 --> 07:02.346
This is what
you guys look like.

07:02.430 --> 07:04.096
-Yeah, it is.
-Yeah, this is us.

07:04.179 --> 07:05.388
Lester:
Be it as it may.
Uh...

07:05.471 --> 07:07.346
We go on the air
in about 40 seconds,

07:07.430 --> 07:08.888
so, what are
we promoting today?

07:08.971 --> 07:11.722
Um, I'm promoting
the Good Faith Variety Tour.

07:11.805 --> 07:12.763
-Oh.
-And what is that?

07:12.847 --> 07:14.346
It's a Christian
variety show.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.179
I'm a comedian--
um, a Christian comedian.

07:16.263 --> 07:17.722
Lester:
A Christian comedian?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.054
Don't tell me anymore.
I wanna make fun of that
on the air.

07:20.638 --> 07:21.763
What, uh--

07:21.847 --> 07:23.638
Yeah, those are
your headphones,
put those on.

07:23.722 --> 07:25.388
Your mic volume is
down below.

07:25.471 --> 07:27.722
Your cough button's there,
that will mute your mic.

07:27.805 --> 07:29.971
Z88.7, The Rock of Charleston.

07:30.054 --> 07:31.597
It's your old buddy Lester
reminding you

07:31.680 --> 07:32.680
that the best defense

07:32.763 --> 07:33.971
is a good offensive, so...

07:34.054 --> 07:35.929
if you struggle with foot odor
like I used to--

07:36.013 --> 07:37.054
Oh boy, don't I know it.

07:37.138 --> 07:38.597
Yeah, attack it
with Dr. Scholl's

07:38.680 --> 07:40.263
Odor-X odor-fighting
foot powder.

07:40.346 --> 07:41.847
It's great.
Ask for it by name.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.346
-(bell dings)
-All right, do it to it. Now...

07:43.430 --> 07:45.388
I'm very excited to have this
guy in studio with us.

07:45.471 --> 07:47.096
-Cindy: Yes.
-First time he's joined us.

07:47.179 --> 07:49.763
-He's a comedian, but he's
a Christian comedian.
-Cindy: Oh!

07:49.847 --> 07:51.388
Yeah, can you think
about that?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.971
-That's like
a Christian stripper.
-(laughter)

07:54.054 --> 07:57.138
-Well, you know, it--
-Let's welcome
Pete Holmes. Pete.

07:57.221 --> 07:58.680
Thank you. Thank you.

07:58.763 --> 08:00.680
You gotta help me out.
I can't wrap my head around

08:00.763 --> 08:03.763
-Christian comedian.
What's going on with that?
-Pete: Oh, you know, it's, uh--

08:03.847 --> 08:06.221
-I'm here for
the Good Faith Variety Tour.
-Lester: Mm-hmm.

08:06.305 --> 08:07.971
Uh, we have ventriloquists,
we have musicians.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.805
-It's a great, great show.
-Lester: Cool, cool.

08:09.888 --> 08:12.179
We have a game we like
to play where we figure out
your porno name.

08:12.263 --> 08:15.096
Cindy:
Ooh, yeah, he's gonna be
really good at this, Lester.

08:15.179 --> 08:16.471
Uh, I don't know
if I want to--

08:16.555 --> 08:18.805
It's really easy.
The ground rules are as follows.

08:18.888 --> 08:21.179
All we need is the name
of the street you grew up on

08:21.263 --> 08:22.929
and the nickname
you have for your junk.

08:23.013 --> 08:25.471
And you put that together,
that's your porno name.

08:25.555 --> 08:26.971
-Pete: I don't know...
-Cindy: This is good.

08:27.054 --> 08:28.929
You're gonna like this.
I'm Oak Thundernuggins.

08:29.013 --> 08:31.388
Yeah, and I'm Pleasant Clambake.

08:31.471 --> 08:34.430
I mean, I don't really...

08:35.680 --> 08:37.346
Bloomfield...

08:37.430 --> 08:38.722
Testes.

08:38.805 --> 08:40.722
-Lester (on radio):
That works. I like that.
-Oh Lord.

08:40.805 --> 08:43.971
-Can I say testes on the radio?
-You did, it's great.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.680
Tell us more
about your show.

08:45.763 --> 08:47.179
Pete:
Well, uh, yeah.

08:47.263 --> 08:50.513
-There's singing, there's music.
-Okay, but what about praying?

08:50.597 --> 08:53.138
This is what I've always
wanted to know. Do you pray?

08:53.888 --> 08:55.096
Yeah, I pray.

08:55.179 --> 08:57.597
Cindy:
But what about,
like during the show?

08:59.597 --> 09:01.013
Nobody prays during the show.

09:01.096 --> 09:02.971
No, there's no prayer
in the show.

09:03.054 --> 09:05.013
It's just a show,
it's a regular show.

09:05.096 --> 09:06.638
But, you know, I pray
before the show.

09:06.722 --> 09:09.096
-Did you pray
before this show?
-I did.

09:09.179 --> 09:10.597
-How's that working?
-(laughing) Yeah.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.513
-I hope it's going okay.
-(laughter)

09:12.597 --> 09:16.054
I-- I mean, I pray before
the show because I'm grateful.

09:16.138 --> 09:19.722
I'm really grateful that I feel
like I found my new family,

09:19.805 --> 09:22.763
and to be part of a tour
that's, uh, bigger--

09:22.847 --> 09:24.263
-bigger than myself, and...
-Cindy: Yeah.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.805
...and to be
in the joy business.

09:25.888 --> 09:28.388
And when I'm on stage,
I really feel God
working through me,

09:28.471 --> 09:29.929
and that's a really
exciting feeling.

09:30.013 --> 09:32.763
-Something that I'm
very passionate about.
-That's my boy.

09:32.847 --> 09:36.054
-Lester: Well,
Hallelujah? Hallelujah!
-Cindy: Hallelujah, yeah.

09:36.138 --> 09:38.054
Hey, I'm getting a note here.
Our other guest is here.

09:38.138 --> 09:39.763
-You wanna bring her in?
-Oh, yeah!

09:39.847 --> 09:41.722
-Yeah, maybe she can help
make sense of all of this.
-Oh, please.

09:41.805 --> 09:44.054
So, she's a regular.
Whenever she's in town,

09:44.138 --> 09:45.929
she loves to come by
and we love to have her.

09:46.013 --> 09:48.179
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jessica Kirson is here.

09:48.263 --> 09:50.263
-She's here now--
-Here she is.

09:50.346 --> 09:52.054
-Here she is. Look at her.
-I know you.

09:52.138 --> 09:54.471
Hey! Whoa! I know you!
How are you?

09:54.555 --> 09:55.805
-How you doing?
-Nice to see you.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.388
Oh, really?
You two know each other?

09:57.471 --> 10:00.096
Yeah, we're comics
from New York, so
we all know each other.

10:00.179 --> 10:03.096
-Cindy: Oh, no kidding?
-Plus, we go to the same
lesbian hair stylist.

10:03.179 --> 10:04.680
(laughs)
It's true.

10:04.763 --> 10:06.680
Nice to have you here.
I love that you stop by

10:06.763 --> 10:08.597
every time you
come through town.
How are you doing?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.805
-Oh, I'm exhausted
right now.
-Lester: Sure.

10:10.888 --> 10:12.847
But I'm very grateful
that you had me on,

10:12.929 --> 10:14.096
and hopefully, like,
two more people

10:14.179 --> 10:15.638
will come to my show
because of it.

10:15.722 --> 10:18.597
-Let's shoot for three.
Big time.
-(laughing) Let's do it.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.971
You're always full
of jokes, Lester.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.263
(laughing):
I hate that hat.

10:22.346 --> 10:24.847
(laughs)
You've always hated my hat.

10:24.929 --> 10:26.555
It's horrible. I mean,
it really, it looks like,

10:26.638 --> 10:28.638
like an old bra of mine
from the '70s.

10:28.722 --> 10:31.179
-It's like a dog toy.
-Is it too early for you
to do a character?

10:31.263 --> 10:33.722
Oh, she's gotta do one.
Jessica, you're so good.

10:33.805 --> 10:36.263
-Really? I mean, I don't--
-Cindy: Yes! We love them!

10:36.346 --> 10:37.638
Okay, I mean...

10:37.722 --> 10:39.388
Could you do
the annoying white girl?
It's my favorite.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.263
(high-pitched, nasally voice):
No, it's not too early.

10:41.346 --> 10:43.597
I'll do it anytime, because
if it's gonna sell tickets,
I'll really do it,

10:43.680 --> 10:45.471
because I just want
people to show up
that are gonna buy tickets.

10:45.555 --> 10:47.847
Like, seriously,
that's all I care about is
that people buy tickets.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.638
(babbling)

10:49.722 --> 10:52.513
-(whining)
-(laughing)

10:52.597 --> 10:55.888
Oh, I wish we could go on,
but we gotta go to break.

10:55.971 --> 10:57.971
I wanna thank you guys
for showing up.

10:58.054 --> 11:00.179
Jessica Kirson tonight
at Theater 99,

11:00.263 --> 11:01.971
downtown Charleston.
Tickets still available?

11:02.054 --> 11:04.471
-Yes!
-And Pete Holmes...
of the Good Faith Variety Show,

11:04.555 --> 11:06.096
this afternoon at 6 p.m.

11:06.179 --> 11:08.805
That's at the United
Fellowship Church.
Check it out.

11:08.888 --> 11:10.805
We gotta go to break,
we'll be back.
Thank you, guys!

11:10.888 --> 11:12.597
-We're back after this.
-Thank you!

11:12.680 --> 11:16.096
Guys, that was great.
Really funny stuff.
Thank you so much.

11:16.179 --> 11:18.388
Hey, do you want to go
get something to eat?

11:18.471 --> 11:19.638
I would love to.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.221
(blues music playing)

11:40.929 --> 11:43.722
-You want hot sauce?
-No, thank you.

11:46.013 --> 11:48.179
Fucking good. Wow.

11:48.263 --> 11:50.555
Yeah, it really is.

11:51.430 --> 11:54.471
So, Christian show?

11:55.597 --> 11:58.138
-Okay, listen, it's like--
-I'm not judging you at all.

11:58.221 --> 12:00.388
It's just,
the last time I saw you,

12:00.471 --> 12:03.888
you were with a tall blonde,
schlepping around
a huge bag of dildos.

12:03.971 --> 12:06.971
-Yeah, I'm, you know,
branching out.
-Oh.

12:07.054 --> 12:08.555
Some nights,
I'm dildo Santa Claus,

12:08.638 --> 12:10.513
other nights,
I do, you know,
Christian shows.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.388
I have no problem
with dildos or blondes.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.096
I just didn't know you
were religious like that.

12:16.805 --> 12:18.305
I'm-- I'm not. I...

12:18.971 --> 12:20.138
I mean, I...

12:20.638 --> 12:22.805
That's how
I was raised, and...

12:24.179 --> 12:25.513
It's so nice.

12:25.597 --> 12:27.054
It's so nice.
You should see.

12:27.138 --> 12:30.054
We have a tour bus,
we get our own bunks.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.263
I play big theaters now
with fans and...

12:32.346 --> 12:34.346
-Awesome.
-...sign autographs.

12:34.430 --> 12:36.263
Everybody's friendly.

12:37.138 --> 12:39.263
And the money, I mean...

12:39.763 --> 12:42.221
Listen, you don't have
to sell me.

12:42.305 --> 12:45.179
I totally get it,
but now I'm dying to know

12:45.263 --> 12:46.471
how much money?

12:46.555 --> 12:48.555
It's a thousand dollars a show.

12:48.638 --> 12:52.054
I would sell my soul
to Jesus for that.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.929
-He doesn't buy souls.
-(laughs)

12:54.013 --> 12:55.597
-The devil--
-I don't know him at all.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.888
It's either fiddle contests
or cash with the devil.

12:57.971 --> 13:00.054
-Got it.
-But Jesus, it's just
a handshake agreement.

13:00.138 --> 13:02.263
He just says,
"Welcome aboard,"
and then you're good.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.597
-Okay.
-I don't know, I thought
you would think I'm a sellout.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.179
I kind of feel
like a-- Am I?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.929
No, I don't--
I would never think that.

13:09.013 --> 13:10.555
You're a fucking entertainer.

13:10.638 --> 13:14.138
If you're making money,
good money, then you
should do it.

13:15.138 --> 13:18.471
That's such a relief.
When you walked
into the radio station,

13:18.555 --> 13:20.471
I felt like
I was getting busted
by the cool kids.

13:20.555 --> 13:22.763
I thought you
were gonna report
back to The Cellar

13:22.847 --> 13:24.263
what a fucking phoney--

13:24.346 --> 13:27.971
No, I am the last person
that would ever judge
you for that.

13:28.054 --> 13:29.305
I was just in Israel.

13:29.388 --> 13:32.263
I did shows
for ultra-Orthodox people,

13:32.346 --> 13:34.013
and, I mean,
do you think I told them

13:34.096 --> 13:36.638
that I'm a lesbian
or that, you know,

13:36.722 --> 13:39.138
I have a kid
or that I'm not religious?

13:39.221 --> 13:42.138
No, I just keep it to myself
and I make the money.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.597
I'm a business person.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.138
You don't feel
like a sellout?

13:45.221 --> 13:49.179
No. I don't do anything
that will keep me up at night.

13:49.638 --> 13:52.847
Everyone needs to just decide
what line they won't cross,

13:52.929 --> 13:55.388
and you need to decide
that for yourself.

13:56.305 --> 13:58.638
I don't know.
I'm overthinking it.

13:58.722 --> 13:59.888
I think you are, too.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.430
Listen, you're making
50 dollars a minute.

14:02.513 --> 14:05.388
I mean, who gives a shit
what anyone thinks?

14:05.471 --> 14:06.597
(chuckling)
Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.346
Why don't you complain
to the line cook,

14:08.430 --> 14:10.680
and let him fucking
fry your hand?

14:10.763 --> 14:12.430
(laughing)

14:13.054 --> 14:14.680
You're paying for this.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.847
Oh, thank you.
Everything was incredible.

14:16.929 --> 14:19.013
Jesus has this one covered.

14:19.096 --> 14:20.929
♪ It's smooth ♪

14:24.263 --> 14:25.847
Oh my God!

14:25.929 --> 14:28.221
-Look!
-(laughing)

14:28.305 --> 14:30.096
Look at all
these tchotchkes.

14:30.597 --> 14:32.430
What? A bunch
of tchotchkes?

14:36.722 --> 14:39.263
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

14:40.555 --> 14:41.680
-What?
-(snickering)

14:41.763 --> 14:44.096
-It's a lesbian question.
-Of course it is.

14:44.179 --> 14:47.471
I love when straight, white men
use me as Dyke Google.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.597
I'm just curious.
It's like, do lesbians
care about...

14:54.179 --> 14:55.847
-tightness?
-(laughs)

14:55.929 --> 14:57.722
Do you sit around and go,
"I went on a date.

14:57.805 --> 15:00.179
Oh, she was so--
she was so tight?"

15:00.263 --> 15:01.555
No!

15:01.638 --> 15:03.221
No, I mean, we're--

15:03.305 --> 15:06.513
I feel like men are
so obsessed with the grip.

15:07.138 --> 15:08.221
I-- I could care less.

15:08.305 --> 15:10.597
In fact, the more
open and wide it is,

15:10.680 --> 15:13.597
the more I just put in there,
you know, like a toe or a foot.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
-Pete: Oh my God.
-Jessica: My cat.

15:15.763 --> 15:18.221
-Oh, God.
-Just shove everything in.

15:18.305 --> 15:20.805
-Pete: Yeah. The remote.
-Yeah. (laughing)

15:24.263 --> 15:27.847
I know this is weird to say,
but that horse has a great ass.

15:28.346 --> 15:30.805
-He does a lot of cardio.
-(laughing)

15:32.722 --> 15:34.471
This is me coming up.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.763
This was fun,
really fun.

15:37.847 --> 15:42.763
I... obviously didn't expect
to run into anyone I knew, so...

15:42.847 --> 15:44.388
It was great for me.
Thank you.

15:44.471 --> 15:47.013
I would've sat
in my hotel room
all day and night.

15:47.096 --> 15:49.096
Me, too.
Just waiting for the show.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.305
Yeah.

15:50.971 --> 15:53.346
-I will see
you around.
-Yes.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.763
Hey. With your thing,

15:55.847 --> 15:58.763
do what you want on stage,
just make sure

15:58.847 --> 16:03.013
that you're not funnier
offstage than you are onstage.

16:05.888 --> 16:07.013
Thanks.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.430
-Bye, Jessie.
-Bye.

16:17.138 --> 16:19.179
(bluegrass music playing)

16:23.722 --> 16:25.555
(phone vibrating)

16:37.971 --> 16:40.054
(music ends)

16:41.013 --> 16:42.929
-Sounds really good.
-Thanks, Pete.

16:43.555 --> 16:46.805
Hey, so you guys
got my e-mail about
the schedule change, right?

16:46.888 --> 16:48.430
-Yeah, thanks.
-Great.

16:48.888 --> 16:49.805
Hi.

16:49.888 --> 16:51.179
How was breakfast?

16:51.263 --> 16:53.138
It was wonderful.
You should've come.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.597
Oh, well, your friend is
a little too...

16:57.263 --> 16:59.138
New York-y for my taste.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.763
-Yeah, um...
-But interesting.

17:03.430 --> 17:07.388
Yeah, she's-- she's
from New Jersey, I think.

17:08.430 --> 17:09.847
But, yeah.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.096
Knock 'em dead.

17:14.929 --> 17:15.971
Pete:
I love the Bible.

17:16.054 --> 17:17.513
I love the Bible, I really do.

17:17.597 --> 17:19.513
And my whole life, people have
been debating whether or not

17:19.597 --> 17:22.346
the Bible is a story
or if it's literally true.

17:22.430 --> 17:25.430
And I always said
the same thing, I'm like,
what's the difference?

17:25.513 --> 17:27.138
I mean this.
What's the difference?

17:27.221 --> 17:30.179
If that book takes you
to that place

17:30.263 --> 17:32.763
of grace and peace and love

17:32.847 --> 17:35.221
and thinking of something
bigger than yourself,

17:35.305 --> 17:36.555
who cares?

17:36.638 --> 17:38.555
Just get there, baby.
Just get there, who cares?

17:38.638 --> 17:40.597
I don't care.
I don't want to debate.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.638
-(applause)
-Right?

17:43.805 --> 17:45.013
But...

17:45.638 --> 17:46.722
I will say

17:46.805 --> 17:48.388
that there are some
things in the Bible

17:48.471 --> 17:50.888
that I hope aren't
literally true.

17:50.971 --> 17:52.179
(laughter)

17:52.263 --> 17:54.054
I hope some parts are myths.

17:54.138 --> 17:56.388
I think you know what parts
I'm talking about.

17:56.471 --> 17:59.388
Uh, Abraham and Isaac.

17:59.471 --> 18:01.221
Genesis 22.

18:01.305 --> 18:02.680
I think you know the story.

18:02.763 --> 18:05.555
God tells Abraham
to kill his son.

18:05.638 --> 18:07.179
Abraham-- look it up--

18:07.263 --> 18:10.013
-goes, "Okay!"
-(laughter)

18:10.096 --> 18:14.096
So he wakes up Isaac.
"Where are we going?"
"Who cares? It doesn't matter."

18:14.179 --> 18:16.638
Two men are gonna go in,
one comes back.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.430
"Daddy doesn't need to tell
you the details, honey.

18:19.513 --> 18:21.179
This is the end."

18:21.513 --> 18:25.096
Wakes up Isaac, takes him
to a mountain so God can see.

18:25.179 --> 18:27.305
He's like a voyeur,
like a snuff film.

18:27.388 --> 18:29.263
(laughter)

18:29.346 --> 18:31.179
God wants to see Abraham do it,

18:31.263 --> 18:32.929
and then he's gonna kill him
and then he doesn't.

18:33.013 --> 18:35.722
I hope that is not
literally true.

18:35.805 --> 18:37.680
If that's just a story
that they tell us

18:37.763 --> 18:40.888
so that we know, oh,
you're supposed to give up
everything for God,

18:40.971 --> 18:44.430
no matter what, no matter
how attached you are to it,
that's beautiful.

18:44.513 --> 18:45.763
Otherwise,

18:45.847 --> 18:47.430
that's just a story
about an old man

18:47.513 --> 18:50.388
who hears voices that
tell him to kill his son.

18:50.471 --> 18:51.597
(laughter)

18:51.680 --> 18:53.680
And he was gonna do it!

18:53.763 --> 18:55.430
He was going to do it.

18:55.513 --> 18:57.263
He had the knife up in the air,

18:57.346 --> 18:59.597
and he heard
another voice, thank God.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.638
What would he have done
if he hadn't heard the voice?

19:01.722 --> 19:03.888
It just would've been...
(sputtering)

19:05.221 --> 19:07.263
Do you love me now?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.722
(laughter)

19:08.805 --> 19:10.763
(screaming)

19:10.847 --> 19:12.805
(laughter)

19:12.888 --> 19:14.722
-That's nuts.
-(applause)

19:15.722 --> 19:17.013
Here's another Bible story.

19:17.096 --> 19:19.680
King David in the Bible
met a woman,

19:19.763 --> 19:22.597
he wanted to marry her,
and the father of that woman

19:22.680 --> 19:24.513
said, "You can marry
my daughter,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.430
but first..."
This is real--

19:26.513 --> 19:29.388
you have to bring me
a hundred foreskins."

19:29.471 --> 19:30.847
-Man: What?!
-(laughter)

19:30.929 --> 19:32.722
That's the correct
response, sir.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.971
Everyone who didn't go,
"What?!" is wrong.

19:36.054 --> 19:37.388
"What?!" is the--

19:37.471 --> 19:39.805
When I read it, I went,
"What?!" that's--

19:39.888 --> 19:44.221
"A hundred foreskins
for my daughter."

19:44.305 --> 19:45.722
Look this up, it's true.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.305
David goes,
"I'll make it 200 hundred."

19:48.388 --> 19:49.513
(audience groans, laughs)

19:49.597 --> 19:51.555
Pardon the expression,
but he was cocky.

19:51.638 --> 19:53.471
(laughter)

19:53.555 --> 19:56.638
He found 200 dudes he hated,

19:57.388 --> 19:59.597
he killed them, and snip-snip.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.471
Put it in a box,
brought it back to the dad,

20:02.555 --> 20:04.597
and the dad was like,
"Oh, good!

20:05.096 --> 20:07.763
You did what I asked."
And then he had to count.

20:08.221 --> 20:09.763
He had to make sure
there was 200.

20:09.847 --> 20:12.680
He was like, "Uh, one...

20:12.763 --> 20:14.722
uh, two...

20:14.805 --> 20:16.638
uh, three...

20:16.722 --> 20:18.847
uh, fo-- Oh, nice try.
That's an eyelid."

20:18.929 --> 20:20.888
(laughter and applause)

20:22.263 --> 20:23.888
Thank you guys so much.

20:23.971 --> 20:26.138
I really mean that.
This is so much fun.

20:26.221 --> 20:27.388
Good night!

20:27.471 --> 20:29.430
(cheers and applause)

20:32.305 --> 20:34.013
Great show, guys.

20:39.971 --> 20:41.096
Pete.

20:42.513 --> 20:44.471
You know I have
to fire you, right?

20:45.221 --> 20:47.096
Yeah, I figured.

20:49.305 --> 20:52.805
You know why we call this
the Good Faith Variety Tour?

20:54.221 --> 20:56.929
Because people buy
their tickets in good faith,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.305
and you pissed all over that.

21:01.221 --> 21:02.555
You said "pissed."

21:02.638 --> 21:04.471
Hilarious.

21:11.847 --> 21:14.179
-John.
-What's up, man?

21:15.013 --> 21:16.388
Uh, I'm off the tour.

21:16.471 --> 21:18.263
(sighs)
I mean, I'm not surprised.

21:18.346 --> 21:20.471
I mean, that stabbing noise
was messed up.

21:20.555 --> 21:24.263
I don't know, man. I just
don't know if I can grow here.

21:24.346 --> 21:27.305
I need to be
in the open fields,

21:27.388 --> 21:29.263
running and talking
about asses.

21:29.346 --> 21:32.555
-(laughing)
-I-- It's just a little
suffocating here right now.

21:32.638 --> 21:34.013
I think you're
so good at it.

21:34.096 --> 21:35.096
Nah, I mean--

21:35.179 --> 21:36.971
to each his own, you know?

21:37.346 --> 21:40.346
I guess God has a different plan
for all of us, man, you know?

21:40.430 --> 21:43.305
Maybe it wasn't in his plan
for you to make $1,000 a night.

21:43.388 --> 21:44.430
(laughing)

21:44.513 --> 21:46.388
It's like, okay,
thank you for that.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.471
Yeah.

21:47.555 --> 21:49.805
Oh, that's salt
in the wound? Thank you.

21:49.888 --> 21:51.638
-Look me up, man.
This was fun.
-All right.

21:51.722 --> 21:54.138
-I'm gonna miss you.
-I'll miss you, too, man.

21:54.221 --> 21:55.722
Bye.

21:56.138 --> 21:58.597
Oh, Pete.
Good luck with Kat, man.

21:59.471 --> 22:00.680
Thanks, man.

22:01.263 --> 22:02.597
See ya.

Why do you look like
a realtor on a bench ad?

22:54.430 --> 22:57.346
I have some properties
I'd like to show you.

22:57.430 --> 22:58.680
(laughing)

22:58.763 --> 23:01.847
She said I was ghosting her,
so I agreed to sit down.

23:01.929 --> 23:03.263
Were you ghosting her?

23:03.929 --> 23:08.805
No, I don't-- I didn't,
you know, reply to her.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.346
That's the definition
of ghosting.

23:12.471 --> 23:15.513
I'm not good with
confrontation, okay, but she...

23:15.597 --> 23:16.847
insisted.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.430
(exhaling):
Fucking hell.

23:18.513 --> 23:19.888
Well, you're gonna have
to have some kind

23:19.971 --> 23:21.471
of official break-up
conversation.

23:21.555 --> 23:23.138
Are you gonna sit
her down and do it?

23:23.221 --> 23:24.847
-No, we broke up.
-Okay.

23:24.929 --> 23:25.888
We know we broke up.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.513
She just wants
an exit interview.

23:27.597 --> 23:29.555
(laughs)
Is that what you're calling it?
An exit interview?

23:29.638 --> 23:32.263
-She called it that.
-That's what they do
at Applebee's

23:32.346 --> 23:34.722
when you get fired and you
wanna sit down with the manager

23:34.805 --> 23:37.054
-and go over what happened.
-That's what we're doing.

23:37.138 --> 23:40.471
We're reviewing my performance
in a relationship. It's not--

23:41.054 --> 23:42.555
You know what?
That is a good tag.

23:42.638 --> 23:45.722
So I'll use that, and that
was a great tag, so...

23:45.805 --> 23:47.680
-Thank you.
-I'm gonna Venmo you for that,

23:47.763 --> 23:50.346
because that was--
that's gonna be hilarious.

23:53.847 --> 23:55.388
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:04.179 --> 24:08.346
I'm sorry I-- on the phone,
I haven't been the best at, um--

24:08.430 --> 24:11.179
Yeah, I know you're scared.
I get it.

24:12.722 --> 24:14.179
Listen, we're both adults,

24:14.263 --> 24:16.096
so we can talk
about what happened

24:16.179 --> 24:17.971
and then we can
both move on.

24:18.054 --> 24:22.305
But we should be real
about this, and we'll
clean it up, and...

24:23.096 --> 24:25.513
-be adults.
-Absolutely.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.597
Why do you think
we shouldn't be together?

24:29.013 --> 24:31.346
You literal-- that--
you want me to lay it out?

24:31.430 --> 24:32.763
Yeah, 'cause I know
what happened.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.221
I know exactly what happened,
but I want to hear

24:35.305 --> 24:37.597
what you think happened.

24:40.555 --> 24:42.221
I just-- I just think...

24:42.805 --> 24:45.888
you're so advanced

24:45.971 --> 24:48.513
and complex and intelligent

24:48.597 --> 24:50.763
and sharp, and I'm just--

24:50.847 --> 24:53.638
I'm like an embryo
compared to you.

24:53.722 --> 24:55.763
It's, it's, it's--
you're out of my league.

24:55.847 --> 24:57.263
I'm in over my head.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.263
And you deserve to be
with someone who loves you

25:00.346 --> 25:02.430
for who you are
who can handle that.

25:03.179 --> 25:05.638
I was overwhelmed.

25:05.722 --> 25:07.471
That is such bullshit.

25:07.555 --> 25:08.929
That is such a cop-out.

25:09.722 --> 25:12.013
You are just lying through
your fucking teeth,

25:12.096 --> 25:13.597
and I want you
to tell me the truth

25:13.680 --> 25:16.430
and tell me what really
is going on here.

25:18.138 --> 25:20.013
I don't see what
the point of, you know,

25:20.096 --> 25:23.013
dredging any negative
experience up. I'm--

25:23.096 --> 25:24.763
No, breaking up with somebody

25:24.847 --> 25:27.929
and then just not talking
to them and avoiding them
is super weak.

25:28.013 --> 25:30.638
That's a lame
fucking move and it's weak.

25:30.722 --> 25:32.138
You're weak, Pete.

25:32.221 --> 25:33.680
Kitty, I'm not,
you know, I'm not--

25:33.763 --> 25:36.555
I'm sorry I'm not the person
that has sex in dressing rooms

25:36.638 --> 25:39.138
and then fucks loud enough
for my mother to hear.

25:39.221 --> 25:41.346
It's not-- those
aren't my moves.

25:41.430 --> 25:42.805
Okay, stop it. Stop.

25:42.888 --> 25:44.305
You keep on talking
about this like

25:44.388 --> 25:46.722
you're some little
innocent choir boy

25:46.805 --> 25:48.805
and all these things
just happened to you

25:48.888 --> 25:51.805
and you were at the mercy
of this fucking trollop

25:51.888 --> 25:54.597
who forced you
into doing crazy shit.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.096
Because I'm a wild one,
and I buy dildos,

25:58.179 --> 26:00.597
and I'm really shaking
things up for you.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.221
But you were
a part of it, Pete.

26:02.305 --> 26:04.513
You were a part
of every single part
of this relationship.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.138
You were behind everything,

26:06.221 --> 26:08.888
and you were behind me
when you were fucking me
in a dressing room.

26:08.971 --> 26:10.555
-I...
-So why did you do it?

26:10.638 --> 26:13.054
Was it for the jokes?
Was it for the sex?

26:13.138 --> 26:15.971
What, you needed someone
to cheer you on in your career?

26:16.054 --> 26:18.346
-No!
-You used me.

26:18.430 --> 26:20.722
And the second you missed
your ex-girlfriend,

26:20.805 --> 26:22.388
you got a little bored with me

26:22.471 --> 26:24.346
and you started
to think, I want out.

26:27.805 --> 26:29.054
You know what?

26:29.138 --> 26:32.555
In ten years, you're gonna
regret this so much,

26:32.638 --> 26:35.638
and I'm gonna realize
that I dodged a fucking bullet.

Not good.

What the fuck just happened?

-Hi, I'm a big fan.
-Nice to meet you.

27:11.722 --> 27:14.263
Amy: It didn't visually
make sense to me.

27:14.805 --> 27:17.138
If, you know,
if we're gonna be
shallow about it.

27:17.221 --> 27:18.763
She was like an eleven.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.555
She was wildly hot.
The fact that you were
gently dumping her

27:21.638 --> 27:23.471
-is infuriating.
-Whoa, he dumped her?

27:23.555 --> 27:25.680
Yes, he was softly
letting her go.

27:25.763 --> 27:28.013
You're lucky she let you
flop around on top of her.

27:28.096 --> 27:31.513
Why did you break up
with that beautiful,
hip-looking girl?

27:31.597 --> 27:33.929
Was she trying to make
you cut your hair...

27:34.013 --> 27:36.305
into an attractive style?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.929
-(laughing)
-You grew up without sisters,
that's the thing.

27:39.013 --> 27:41.263
-He does seem like that.
-He needed sisters.

27:41.346 --> 27:43.013
He does seem like the guy
who has to leave a date

27:43.096 --> 27:44.555
'cause he twisted a testicle.

27:44.638 --> 27:47.513
Oh yeah, like he needs
to go home and address it.

27:47.597 --> 27:49.179
I wish I could
break up with you.

27:49.263 --> 27:50.597
(laughter)

27:50.680 --> 27:51.971
I'm jealous of that girl.

27:52.054 --> 27:54.096
Not just 'cause, like,
she's so thin and beautiful,

27:54.179 --> 27:55.971
but I hope she has
a great life.

27:56.054 --> 27:58.680
And I think you know
you'll die alone.
