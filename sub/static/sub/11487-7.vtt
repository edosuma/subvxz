00:03.960 --> 00:06.110
Are you guys as excited as l am?

00:08.280 --> 00:09.838
Probably not.

Okay.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.712
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.916
You guys are the best.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.798
ls this a chocolate fudge cake?

00:37.960 --> 00:39.757
You tell us, you brought it.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.196
Make a wish
and blow out the candles.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.952
Oh, right, right.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.997
l wish this was chocolate fudge.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.155
Okay, now it's time for party games.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.390
l've got one.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.637
lt's called Drink Until This Night
Makes Some Sort of Sense.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.353
l'll go first.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.115
Nope, not yet.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.836
Round two.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.870
Uncle Charlie?

01:19.040 --> 01:20.155
Go away.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.632
Have you seen my iPod?

01:22.800 --> 01:23.789
No.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.559
What about you, Rose?

01:28.760 --> 01:30.318
No. Sorry, Jake.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.040
Oh, man.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.472
Good morning, sleepyhead.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.831
Morning.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.672
So.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.115
What's new?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.989
That's good coffee.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.193
-Good morning.
-lt's getting there.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.510
-Whose birthday cake?
-Rose.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.874
Oh, surprise party?

02:26.040 --> 02:28.600
No, l think she saw it coming.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.469
-Morning.
-Morning.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.039
Hey. Coffee?

02:33.200 --> 02:34.679
Can you make it to go?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.109
To go?

02:36.280 --> 02:39.272
Yeah, the thing is,
l made a little boo-boo.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.873
-A boo-boo?
-A boo-boo.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.475
Anyway, l may have to leave town
for a few days.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.555
Why? What did you do?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.676
Rose.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.749
What?

02:52.560 --> 02:54.915
l did Rose.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.154
Wait. You had sex with Rose?
Are you insane?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.878
Moot point, Alan.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.918
What l have to do is find my passport
and head for the border.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.516
What you have to do is tell Rose
that l was drunk and l'm sorry. . .

03:06.680 --> 03:11.037
. . .and that there's no reason to hunt me
down and glue my testicles to my thigh.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.714
Again.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.589
l'll tell you now, you're swabbing on
your own nail polish remover this time.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.115
That wasn't pleasant
for either of us, Berta.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.669
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Thinking?

03:21.840 --> 03:23.068
There was no thinking.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.993
We had tequila shots,
were talking, having a nice evening. . .

03:26.160 --> 03:28.037
. . .and somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.668
-Somebody?
-lt might have been me.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.912
The next thing l know, Jake
is waking us up looking for his iPod.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.957
Wait, Jake saw you in bed with Rose?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.189
No.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.319
Oh, great, great. That's great.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.630
-What am l gonna tell him?
-Who cares? He's 1 1 .

03:43.800 --> 03:45.631
He'll get over it.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.439
l'm the one who still has a bald patch
on my scrotum.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.114
And let me tell you,
the comb-over isn't fooling anybody.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.511
-Morning.
-Oh, hey, look, it's Rose.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.148
-Morning, Rose.
-Hey, birthday girl.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.992
You get anything good last night?

04:04.840 --> 04:06.239
lt was a wonderful party.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.118
lsn't that nice.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.429
Can l get you anything?

04:09.600 --> 04:12.672
Coffee, orange juice,
industrial strength adhesive?

04:13.840 --> 04:16.673
No, l can't stay.
l'm having a birthday lunch with my dad.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.512
Well, that's great.
Not that l'm anxious for you to leave.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.796
lt's great you're gonna
spend time with dad.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.153
Dads are great. l like the word ''dad''
better than ''father. ''

04:25.320 --> 04:28.118
lf Hitler had called Germany
dadland instead of fatherland. . .

04:28.280 --> 04:30.236
. . .it would have been
a friendlier country.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.348
-Charlie.
-Yes?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.238
-You're acting crazy.
-Am l?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.914
Hey, if anybody knows.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.474
l understand last night
was just one of those things.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.358
l have no expectations.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.672
Okay. Good.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.671
-And?
-And nothing.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.114
l'll see you later.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.669
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.990
Oh, God, it's worse than l thought.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.276
What are you talking about?
She sounded fine.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.793
Berta, tell him.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.473
She's nuts, he's screwed.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.112
-Uncle Charlie?
-Yeah, buddy?

05:06.280 --> 05:09.192
You know what would be cool?
lf you and Rose got married.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.998
Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.274
l could be the best man.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.194
Carry the ring for you
and the medication for her.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.191
Do pharmacies have bridal registries?

05:21.040 --> 05:23.429
Hey, have you guys talked
about having kids?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.990
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of teeny-weeny, crazy-ass feet?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.637
No, he's not gonna marry Rose.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.836
Why not?
He's already getting sex from her.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.032
Jake. Jake,
the only reason Rose was in my bed. . .

05:40.200 --> 05:42.156
. . .is because she was
too tired to go home.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.076
Uncle Charlie, l'm an underachiever,
not an idiot.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.995
Okay, fine. You want the truth?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.993
-Charlie, be discreet.
-Because a man and woman have sex. . .

05:55.160 --> 05:57.720
. . .doesn't mean they get married
or they see each other.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.872
lt doesn't even mean
they have to give their actual names.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.472
Thank you for your discretion.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.873
No, no. lt's time somebody
taught him the facts of life.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.396
What facts? That you did a stupid thing
because you're a stupid man?

06:10.560 --> 06:11.834
l was getting to that.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.035
Why was it stupid?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.475
Because he had sex with someone
he doesn't love.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.517
No, no. Because l had sex
with someone. . .

06:17.680 --> 06:19.989
. . .who knows how to disable
the alarm system.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.479
And who has no compunction
about shaving my head while l sleep.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.799
-What's a compunction?
-Go get ready for bed.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.075
Sounds dirty.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.719
Just go.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.509
Hey, lady,
l can see your compunction.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.432
-Charlie, do me a favor?
-What?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.318
-Don't talk to my kid about sex.
-Why?

06:39.480 --> 06:40.959
Because you're a pig.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.836
Okay.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.395
-What was that?
-What was what?

06:47.560 --> 06:49.357
lt was a thump.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.829
-What do you mean a thump?
-You know, a thump.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.468
Like a woman dressed as a ninja
jumping from a tree. . .

06:54.640 --> 06:57.279
. . .and landing on the roof
with cat-like precision.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.033
-l didn't hear anything.
-Well, l did.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.715
l guess your hearing's more acute
when your nuts are on the line.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.193
Come on, you don't really
think Rose is gonna do anything?

07:10.360 --> 07:13.079
Hey, l never told you
half the weird stuff she pulled here.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.397
-Why not?
-We needed a babysitter. . .

07:15.560 --> 07:17.391
. . .and l didn't want you
to get spooked.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.550
Okay, l'm listening.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.034
One time she trained a seagull
to swoop down--

07:26.200 --> 07:28.589
Oh, God, this is it.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.152
Come on. l can not believe a grown man
like you is afraid of a little girl.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.357
A little girl with a big seagull.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.713
Went right for my eyes.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.508
You ever seen one of them swoop down
on a picnic table to grab a french fry?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.193
-lt was just like that.
-Charlie.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.679
That's how she trained it.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.593
Took a picture of me
and put french fries all over it.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.629
You're being ridiculous.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.429
Am l?

07:58.760 --> 08:00.637
We'll see.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.630
-Are you Charlie Harper?
-Yes, l am.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.472
l'm Rose's father.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.797
l don't see a way out of this, do you?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.916
So you're Rose's dad.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.514
l can see the resemblance.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.155
You and l need to talk.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.638
Okay, sure, if you want.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.678
l'm booked for the next few days,
but maybe we can next week.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.796
-Now.
-Or now.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.951
There's a window in my schedule.
Come on in.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.633
Thank you.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.950
-Can l get you something to drink?
-l'm fine.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.759
You don't mind if l have
a conversation starter, do you?

08:57.920 --> 08:59.592
-Knock yourself out.
-l'm gonna try.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.630
-So l'm Charlie's brother, Alan.
-Nice to meet you.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.597
Same here.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.478
l never slept with your daughter.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.718
l'm not surprised.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.752
Okay. Rose's dad.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.354
-Call me Harvey.
-Okay, Harvey.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.432
Easy. Like the invisible rabbit
in that Jimmy Stewart movie.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.750
-What was that called?
-Harvey.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.909
Right.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.634
Loved that movie.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.793
People don't know it was originally a play.
Then they tried to make it a musical.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.949
-Charlie?
-Yes, sir?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.315
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.791
Now. . .

09:54.960 --> 09:57.190
. . .what are your intentions
towards my daughter?

09:57.360 --> 10:00.238
Oh, right to the chase.
Straight shooter.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.675
l like that.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.789
Thirsty.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.158
So where were we?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.519
He wants to know
what your intentions are towards Rose.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.830
Thank you.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.394
Well, l would have to say
that my intentions are good.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.471
Anybody who knows me
would confirm. . .

10:26.640 --> 10:29.518
. . .that ''Charlie Harper
has good intentions. ''

10:29.680 --> 10:34.117
His actions, on the other hand,
are usually selfish and asinine.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.991
Again, thank you.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.670
Harvey, l'm glad we had this chance
to talk--

10:40.840 --> 10:42.319
-Sit down.
-Sorry.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.040
-You gonna marry my daughter or not?
-Not.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.760
-Not?
-A very well-intended not.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.189
So after two years together, you just
plan to keep on stringing her along?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.716
No, l would never--
Wait a minute, did you say two years?

10:56.880 --> 10:59.314
Now look, Rose cares very much
about you. . .

10:59.480 --> 11:01.038
. . .and she's not gonna leave you.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.998
So l think the honorable thing
for you to do is let her go.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.030
Believe me, Harvey, l've tried.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.799
God, how l've tried.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.430
So, what's the problem?
You love her too much?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.039
Not exactly.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.078
l mean, she's a wonderful gal
and l do care for her.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.708
But you see--

11:22.880 --> 11:25.713
What, the peanut gallery taking
a break?

11:26.520 --> 11:29.080
Harvey, the truth is,
Charlie has tried to end it.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.515
But your daughter
doesn't handle rejection well.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.874
Or all that legally.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.758
ln my defense, we're not talking
about a long-term relationship.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.948
We're talking about a couple of nights
of drunken, frenzied sex two years apart.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.396
-That's your defense?
-l didn't say it was a good defense.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.357
You'll have to forgive my brother.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.478
He thinks with his penis
and his penis isn't very bright.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.035
That's true. Anybody
who knows me will confirm that.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.276
l can confirm that.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.113
Oh, for God sake.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.116
Rose, did you tell your father
we've been going out for two years?

12:09.280 --> 12:12.636
Yeah. l thought it sounded better
than saying we had a one-night stand. . .

12:12.800 --> 12:14.791
. . .and then l stalked you
for two years.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.552
She's not wrong.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.559
Daddy, try to understand.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.950
l didn't want you to feel sorry for me. . .

12:23.120 --> 12:25.918
. . .or try to set me up with anybody.
Or have me committed.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.038
Oh, sweetheart,
l would never do that.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.668
We're a wealthy family.
We can afford home care.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.470
Okay, well, l'm glad
we had this chance to clear the air.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.509
l'm sure you two have a lot to talk about
so l'll let you get to it.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.358
-Mom?
-Hang on, dear.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.756
-Hello?
-Alan. Oh, good, l'm glad you're home.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.437
Listen, l'm in the neighborhood
and l know how Charlie hates it. . .

12:56.600 --> 13:01.833
. . .when l just drop in unannounced,
so l thought l'd call first.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.076
l'll let him know.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.356
Charlie, Mom's coming over.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.799
Tell her l'm not here.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.308
Hi, sweetie. Oh, hello, Rose.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.517
Hi, Evelyn.
Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.070
-Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey.
-Harvey, nice to meet you.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.916
Nice to meet you.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.756
So, what are we talking about?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.755
Well, Charlie and l got hammered
last night. . .

13:39.920 --> 13:42.753
. . .and then somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.638
lt might have been me.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.310
Then we ended up
spending the night together.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.190
l see.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.548
Are you as proud of yours
as l am of mine?

13:59.200 --> 14:01.111
You do the best you can
to raise them. . .

14:01.280 --> 14:04.238
. . .but in the end they drive down
life's highway on their own.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.389
lsn't that the truth?

14:05.560 --> 14:09.519
l think God gives us children so death
won't come as such a disappointment.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.111
So, Evelyn. . .

14:17.280 --> 14:18.429
. . .are you married?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.355
Not at the moment.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.275
Why? What do you have in mind?

14:24.440 --> 14:27.716
Well, maybe we could start
with a little dinner.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.709
Sounds good.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.795
But how do you wanna finish?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.308
Simultaneously.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.152
Oh, he's good.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.639
Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.438
-Hold on. Alan?
-Yeah?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.716
Get the door.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.438
Boys, we have a problem.
We need to talk.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.790
-What's going on?
-We haven't seen you in days.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.599
-Not that we're complaining.
-Merely an observation.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.274
Well, as you know,
l have been seeing Rose's father.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.637
-And how's that going?
-At first it was wonderful.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.157
He was handsome, charming,
and a raging bull in the sack.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.788
No mental pictures. Push them out.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.190
Well, don't give them to me.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.509
What l didn't realize. . .

15:24.680 --> 15:29.629
. . .is the man has the emotional stability
of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.157
-What did he do?
-lt's what he didn't do.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.550
-Okay, what didn't he do?
-Leave.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.078
Now, a couple of days
of Viagra-enhanced boinking. . .

15:39.240 --> 15:41.800
. . .and he suddenly thinks
he lives with me.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.270
He's moving my furniture around,
he's getting his mail forwarded. . .

15:45.440 --> 15:47.431
. . .he had a satellite dish installed.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.238
Did he get the NFL package?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.755
Charlie, please, this is not funny.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.470
This man is obsessed with me.
He will not let me out of his sight.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.278
Wherever l go, there he is. . .

15:57.440 --> 15:59.795
. . .with this stupid love-smitten look
on his face.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.916
You just wanna hit him with a shovel.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.190
Well, what do you want us to do?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.874
Come over to my house
and hit him with a shovel.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.112
Wouldn't it be easier to keep
feeding him Viagra until he strokes?

16:11.280 --> 16:14.477
Charlie, don't be ridiculous.
That could take months.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.234
Come on now, guys, think.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.868
How can l get this loon out
of my house?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.315
-l say we bring in expert help.
-Way ahead of you.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.277
Rose.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.192
-Yes, Charlie?
-Road trip.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.311
Oh, goody, l'll meet you in the garage.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.071
-Daddy?
-Oh, Rose, good.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.117
You got my change-of-address card.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.315
And there's my other favorite gal.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.630
-Hello, Harvey.
-Where were you, pudding pop?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.472
l was worried sick.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.871
-l just went out.
-l didn't see you leave.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.679
That's because l climbed out
the laundry room window.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.672
Aren't you a limber little minx.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.590
Daddy, we need to talk.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.829
Yes, right away, honey.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.877
Hey, fellas,
are you ready for some football?

17:14.560 --> 17:17.915
Evie, why don't you get our guests
some cold drinks?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.559
Yes, of course, dear.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.233
Garden shed. Shovel. Bag of lime.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.269
-Daddy, listen to me very closely.
-Okay.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.188
You don't live here.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.075
Yes, l do. Look at me.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.916
We've been through this before,
remember?

17:37.600 --> 17:40.319
The pretty receptionist
at your psychiatrist's office?

17:40.480 --> 17:43.472
Oh, yeah. Cheryl.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.552
She had a mean lawyer.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.514
But this is different.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.989
Evelyn and l are in love,
we're gonna get married.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.479
lsn't that right?

17:52.640 --> 17:56.394
Not if you were the last crazy man
on Earth.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.831
Guys, feel free to call me Dad.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.594
-No, thank you.
-l couldn't.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.677
Daddy, pay attention.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.432
Okay.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.639
l know what it feels like to be so in love
with someone you wanna crawl inside. . .

18:11.800 --> 18:14.951
. . .so that you're wearing their skin
like a leotard with nipples.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.354
What l've learned is that not everyone
is ready for that kind of intimacy.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.838
Take me and Charlie for example.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.592
We slept together two years ago. . .

18:26.760 --> 18:30.036
. . .realized we were better as friends,
and haven't done it again since.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.389
-We haven't?
-You were too drunk.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.710
l was gonna tell you eventually.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.599
Then why did you let me think
we did?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.830
Because it doesn't make
any difference.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.479
l'm in this for the long haul.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.474
Sweetheart, when Evie and l get married
Charlie will be your stepbrother.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.111
Oh, l didn't think of that.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.077
Oh, trés kinky.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.471
Rose, stick with the plan.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.076
Okay.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.357
Daddy,
l didn't wanna have to do this. . .

19:01.520 --> 19:03.829
. . .but l brought someone else here
to talk to you.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.878
-Who?
-Come on in, Grandma.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.031
You brought Mother?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.033
Harvey, how many times
have l told you. . .

19:14.200 --> 19:16.589
. . .not to leave the estate
without telling me?

19:16.760 --> 19:19.274
-Mom.
-Playtime's over.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.796
-Get in the car, we're going home.
-But, Mom, we're getting married.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.997
To this trash? l don't think so.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.914
Excuse me?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.112
Roll with it, Mom.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.751
l'm counting to three, Harvey.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.672
One, two--

19:34.840 --> 19:37.229
l'm going, l'm--

19:37.400 --> 19:41.473
-Keep the robe.
-Thanks. l'm not wearing pants.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.712
Harvey, do you want me
to put you over my knee?

19:44.880 --> 19:46.359
All right, l'm going.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.076
He's really a good boy.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.391
But these things happen
when you marry a first cousin.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.515
l'd say they're lucky to have thumbs.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.152
l'm really sorry to impose on you.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.039
l just feel very uncomfortable
being home alone tonight.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.839
-No problem, you sleep in my room.
-Where will you sleep?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.877
l don't know, l'll find somebody.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.795
-l'm beat. l'm gonna go to bed.
-Good night.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.838
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night, Mom.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.755
Sleep tight, pudding pop.
