WEBVTT

00:58.560 --> 01:02.203
She was being chased, there
was no place she could hide.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.978
She was face to face
with a terrible monster,

01:06.980 --> 01:09.428
but she didn't feel any fear

01:09.430 --> 01:11.433
and then the monster attacked her!

01:13.070 --> 01:16.443
I'll never give up, do you hear me, never!

01:16.445 --> 01:20.026
Go away, ugly monster,
go away or I'll kill you!

01:20.028 --> 01:22.292
Do you hear me?

01:28.214 --> 01:30.131
It was a wild struggle.

01:31.570 --> 01:33.608
The lady was completely covered in blood,

01:33.610 --> 01:36.223
but despite being injured,
she continued to fight.

01:51.163 --> 01:54.630
Finally, she beat the monster!

01:57.191 --> 01:58.398
The end.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.270
- Well done.
- That was terrible.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.042
Boo!

02:10.694 --> 02:13.622
- Bah bup bup bup.
- Go away, you're terrible!

02:13.624 --> 02:15.038
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay uh,

02:15.040 --> 02:17.027
can I ask you to be quiet, please?

02:17.029 --> 02:21.950
But we thank her for that
performance that was most unusual.

02:35.730 --> 02:36.730
Nelly.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.170
Let's talk about it.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.423
Your friends probably really
liked the play, deep down.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.983
Those kids are not my friends.

02:55.937 --> 02:58.837
Hey, come out of there now.

03:10.110 --> 03:12.688
I know it doesn't feel like it now, Nelly,

03:12.690 --> 03:14.771
but school's just a small part of life.

03:14.773 --> 03:16.318
Just 12 years.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.848
Yeah, maybe you can pretend to be

03:18.850 --> 03:20.423
more like all the other kids?

03:22.190 --> 03:23.943
So it'll be easier for you.

03:25.534 --> 03:27.968
And remember, those who
are popular now, Nelly,

03:27.970 --> 03:29.038
are often the ones who...

03:29.040 --> 03:31.908
Who just end up as failures as adults.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.277
Have I said that?

03:33.279 --> 03:34.548
After the Christmas show

03:34.550 --> 03:37.708
and when you were angry 'cause
nobody came to my party.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.330
Okay, but get changed
now so we can get going.

03:41.332 --> 03:43.153
Oh, hello my baby.

03:44.752 --> 03:45.752
Yeah.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.238
It'll be nice to
get away for a while, right?

03:51.240 --> 03:54.288
Get out to the country,
see uncle Hannibal,

03:54.290 --> 03:57.253
enjoy the fresh air,
recharge our batteries.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.607
Impressive, right?

04:42.609 --> 04:45.553
Yeah, not a bad place to
spend your fall break.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.798
Oh well that's great.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.008
So then I guess Hannibal
did call for help.

05:04.010 --> 05:07.158
Yeah, or rather,
it was me who called.

05:07.160 --> 05:07.991
I see.

05:07.993 --> 05:09.108
This is Nelly.

05:09.110 --> 05:12.382
Right, and you are her assistant?

05:12.384 --> 05:14.198
You could call it that.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
Here you are.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.858
Or dad, as we say at home.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.168
So it's a family business.

05:21.170 --> 05:22.523
- Here, take this.
- Thanks.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.658
Please, you can come on in.

05:25.660 --> 05:26.758
We have all this space,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.158
so you might as well get
started with the cleaning.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.997
You can work in shifts.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.308
No no,

05:32.310 --> 05:34.568
I think there may have
been a misunderstanding.

05:34.570 --> 05:35.708
Oh yeah.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.748
You see, this is Nelly.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.343
Nelly rapp, Hannibal's niece.

05:41.270 --> 05:44.953
And I'm Nelly's father,
I was married to Alice.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.218
We've met before, many times,

05:48.220 --> 05:50.949
but it was, of course, a long time ago.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.103
Are you Nelly?

05:53.980 --> 05:58.083
Are you that Nelly, Alice's daughter?

05:59.910 --> 06:02.557
Yes, you are.

06:02.559 --> 06:05.628
You know, I'm so stupid,
last time I saw you,

06:05.630 --> 06:09.458
you were a tiny baby and
you look just like anyone,

06:09.460 --> 06:11.728
with that ordinary face.

06:11.730 --> 06:12.561
Thanks.

06:12.563 --> 06:16.078
I'm so sorry, I thought
Hannibal had hired you

06:16.080 --> 06:19.634
to do the washing up along
with the cleaning and cooking.

06:19.636 --> 06:21.818
No.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.018
Surely Hannibal knows that Nelly
is staying here for a week?

06:25.020 --> 06:29.658
Oh yeah, oh yes,
Hannibal, yes, he knows.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.628
At least I think so.

06:31.630 --> 06:34.848
You are welcome to use all
the rooms as you please,

06:34.850 --> 06:36.508
except the cellar.

06:36.510 --> 06:38.348
What's in the cellar?

06:38.350 --> 06:40.543
Monsters, so don't go there.

06:41.525 --> 06:42.356
What?

06:42.358 --> 06:44.718
Yeah, of course there are
no monsters in the cellar,

06:44.720 --> 06:48.658
Nelly, I'm sure are aware that
Lena is just joking with you.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.660
Lena-sleva, hm.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.323
And this is your room.

07:08.260 --> 07:11.728
I thought I'd stay for the
night, while she settles in.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.958
That way I'll be more comfortable.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.204
Yes, you do that, and feel
free to do some cleaning.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.520
Your mother also liked it here.

07:36.380 --> 07:40.357
She always said she liked old,
haunted houses.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.518
You're sure it's haunted?

07:41.520 --> 07:44.995
Oh, absolutely not.

07:46.020 --> 07:49.594
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

07:49.596 --> 07:51.163
Ah.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.518
Uh no, uh uh buh buh buh,

07:55.520 --> 07:58.058
we normally only have candy on Saturdays.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.552
Enjoy them, dear.

07:59.554 --> 08:00.923
Right.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.803
Okay, thank you, Lena-sleva.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.453
She's very quiet.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.498
Are she and Hannibal married?

08:09.500 --> 08:12.153
No, they're old teacher
colleagues and friends.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.263
I don't actually know, Nelly.

08:16.950 --> 08:20.108
Can't actually say I've ever
understood these people.

08:20.110 --> 08:21.231
Come here, London.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.773
Is that why we never visit them?

08:24.770 --> 08:28.846
So, I'll get your bag
so you can settle in, mm.

08:28.848 --> 08:31.208
Oh, oh.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.424
I simply forgot the milk.

09:49.091 --> 09:52.829
Keep quiet.

10:57.050 --> 10:59.884
We'll let you
out when you calm down.

11:07.503 --> 11:08.334
There.

11:08.336 --> 11:09.950
I'll write
the report for Vincent.

11:09.952 --> 11:12.272
Yes, you'd better do that.

11:12.274 --> 11:14.011
Papa, wake.

11:14.013 --> 11:15.393
Papa, wake up.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.641
What, what is it?

11:17.643 --> 11:21.418
Uncle Hannibal has a vampire
in a cage in the cellar.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.843
No, no he doesn't.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.118
What Lena-sleva says
about monsters and stuff

11:26.120 --> 11:28.178
is just a story.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.848
No no no, it's true, I saw it!

11:30.850 --> 11:33.888
Please dad, come on, it's a vampire.

11:33.890 --> 11:37.858
It had fangs and Hannibal's
hand had a bloody bandage on it.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.966
What if he got bitten by the vampire?

11:39.968 --> 11:41.558
What were you doing coming down here

11:41.560 --> 11:42.948
in the middle of the night?

11:42.950 --> 11:45.178
Something could have happened.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.180
Oh.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.588
Oh, have you seen this?

11:52.590 --> 11:54.568
It's your grandmother yardis.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.248
What a nice portrait.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.508
Come on!

11:57.510 --> 11:58.810
Yeah yeah yeah.

12:05.580 --> 12:07.518
But, it was here.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.948
It was probably a dream.

12:08.950 --> 12:10.888
You may have been sleepwalking.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.373
Come on, come here.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.608
It's not unusual to have nightmares

12:15.610 --> 12:18.358
when you sleep in an unfamiliar place.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.168
And may I remind you, you're
a very sensitive little girl.

12:22.170 --> 12:25.378
Skip the psychology, I know what I saw.

12:25.380 --> 12:30.288
Mm, okay, come on sweetie,
let's go back to bed.

12:30.290 --> 12:35.133
You need some sleep and
daddy's got a very early start.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.390
Good morning, London.

12:53.949 --> 12:58.243
London, time to get up.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.100
London.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.073
Time for breakfast.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.258
If there's the slightest
sign of homesickness,

13:11.260 --> 13:12.248
you'll have to call.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.448
Nelly's a bit, she's a bit unusual.

13:16.450 --> 13:20.638
It's like she has her own
fantasy world inside her head

13:20.640 --> 13:22.713
and she gets stuck in it sometimes.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.498
And one other thing I need to mention,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.893
if there are other kids of her age around,

13:29.749 --> 13:31.578
that would be great.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.078
I'm afraid she hasn't got
many friends back at home.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.553
At school, I believe she
hasn't quite found her,

13:39.840 --> 13:40.953
- oh, Nelly.
- Nelly.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.460
Welcome.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.578
Did you sleep okay?

13:48.580 --> 13:51.913
Your father says you've
been having nightmares.

13:53.370 --> 13:55.383
No monsters in the cellar, hm?

13:56.310 --> 13:57.727
- Ah.
- Cigarillo?

13:59.539 --> 14:00.598
Uh buh buh buh buh.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.319
Now just a minute, Nelly
is only 11 years old.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.168
I see.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.338
And here's a dog.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.178
London.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.180
Hello London.

14:10.890 --> 14:11.890
London.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.521
So.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.128
Oh, I guess you're
getting hungry, huh Nelly?

14:21.130 --> 14:22.130
Hm?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
Right.

14:26.870 --> 14:28.278
You want to have something to eat.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.080
No problem, I'll see what we've got.

14:31.860 --> 14:32.860
Oh.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.550
Hello, this is lennart.

14:37.761 --> 14:39.898
Yeah, okay, go ahead, make a start.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.853
I'll join you later, quietly.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.960
Yeah.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
Uh huh.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.875
Okay, I'll meet you there.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
Okay.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.852
Mmhmm.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.898
- All right.
- We've got halloumi bowl,

14:58.900 --> 15:01.119
beef croquets, pasta carbonara...

15:02.240 --> 15:04.748
Oh, I got it.

15:04.750 --> 15:05.968
Ah.

15:05.970 --> 15:08.423
Oh god!

15:11.260 --> 15:13.718
Well, you're not as
fast as you once were.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.744
You need to get to the
hospital, you need a doctor!

15:16.746 --> 15:18.178
- No no no no...
- No no no no, it's fine.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.578
It's not necessary.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.088
Some blood and other minor injuries

15:22.090 --> 15:26.278
is nothing for a retiree or pensioner.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.988
I took an early retirement.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.528
Yes, and in winter, when it's slippery,

15:30.530 --> 15:34.288
we fall and break something
every day, don't we?

15:34.290 --> 15:37.358
Nelly, you have to get ready
to come back to town with me,

15:37.360 --> 15:38.408
- okay?
- No no no no,

15:38.410 --> 15:40.968
Nelly should stay here with us.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.218
And of course surely

15:42.220 --> 15:44.320
you want to stay here with uncle Hannibal.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.598
Come on, we'll go
and get some breakfast.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.550
Go on, I'll see you in a few minutes.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.570
Doodle oo.

15:57.550 --> 15:58.381
Brace yourself.

15:58.383 --> 15:59.214
- No, don't...
- Yes.

15:59.216 --> 16:00.718
- Stop, ah...
- Come on.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.928
Do not come near me,
it's really painful.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.515
I'm only trying to help you.

16:05.517 --> 16:06.448
Get something,

16:06.450 --> 16:08.603
get some pruning shears or something.

16:09.730 --> 16:10.930
It'll be a lot of fun.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.748
When you get an arrow
straight through your arm,

16:14.750 --> 16:16.988
it is not a minor injury.

16:16.990 --> 16:18.838
Of course you need a doctor.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.053
Immediately, straight away,
with no discussion whatsoever.

16:24.570 --> 16:27.238
Do you remember last summer
when I got stung by a wasp?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.713
It hurt, a lot.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.493
Imagine an arrow straight
through your arm, oh my god!

17:00.220 --> 17:02.818
I wish I could have
done something about work, but...

17:02.820 --> 17:03.870
Don't worry at all.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.883
Nelly is in good hands.

17:09.025 --> 17:12.160
Come on, come here.

19:50.561 --> 19:51.561
Hannibal.

19:56.409 --> 19:57.789
Mama.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.583
Oh, it's only you.

20:20.397 --> 20:22.647
What, what is this place?

20:25.730 --> 20:27.273
What is this place?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.183
The fact that you found it,

20:34.290 --> 20:36.273
that means that you are ready now.

20:37.380 --> 20:40.188
You'll find out everything
sooner or later anyway.

20:40.190 --> 20:43.071
Ready to do what?

20:43.073 --> 20:47.697
What I'm about to tell
you is very, very secret,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.088
and you must promise me

20:52.090 --> 20:54.918
that you will never, ever tell anyone

20:54.920 --> 20:58.113
whether they are a living
creature or even a dead one.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.518
Understand?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.678
Good.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.188
It's like this,

21:03.190 --> 21:06.348
there are monsters and
other creatures in the world

21:06.350 --> 21:09.636
and they are not of human kind.

21:09.638 --> 21:10.828
What do you mean?

21:10.830 --> 21:11.747
What's that?

21:11.749 --> 21:12.678
What do you mean?

21:12.680 --> 21:13.801
Sorry?

21:13.803 --> 21:14.696
For real?

21:14.698 --> 21:15.529
Huh, what?

21:15.531 --> 21:16.531
- For real?
- Yes.

21:18.710 --> 21:21.078
This is our library.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.308
Here is all our research

21:23.310 --> 21:27.518
and everything that's ever
been written about monsters.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.138
And guess what,

21:29.140 --> 21:32.958
people come from all over
the world to see this

21:32.960 --> 21:35.463
to read everything that we've documented.

21:40.160 --> 21:44.238
And here, we have a collection
of different organs.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.988
We have monster paws...

21:45.990 --> 21:47.878
What, really?

21:47.880 --> 21:50.308
Undeveloped fetuses over there.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.808
Uh huh.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.253
And here, here,

21:57.159 --> 21:59.940
these are delicious.

21:59.942 --> 22:03.118
Mm, pickled eggs.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.120
Try one.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.571
They keep forever, go on.

22:07.573 --> 22:09.123
Don't be shy.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.208
Most of the time there's
a very good balance

22:17.210 --> 22:19.173
between monsters and humans.

22:20.650 --> 22:23.578
The monsters keep to themselves, usually,

22:23.580 --> 22:26.018
and people don't really notice them.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.308
For the most part, it works,

22:27.310 --> 22:30.688
but then sometimes something goes haywire

22:30.690 --> 22:32.908
and they don't like that they're monsters.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.018
That's when they start breaking the rules

22:35.020 --> 22:36.978
and that's where we come in.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.348
We are the monster agents.

22:39.350 --> 22:41.698
Our most important task

22:41.700 --> 22:44.888
is to protect the world from monsters

22:44.890 --> 22:47.118
and to protect monsters from the world.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.875
You and Hannibal, are you agents?

22:49.877 --> 22:51.388
Mmhmm.

22:51.390 --> 22:52.390
Come.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.328
This is where we bring difficult monsters.

23:06.330 --> 23:08.013
Don't worry, he's asleep.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.618
These are the ones who can't be helped

23:10.620 --> 23:12.093
in their natural environment.

23:15.570 --> 23:18.098
This one hasn't stuck to his diet

23:18.100 --> 23:21.648
and last night he went
out looking for blood.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.913
Luckily we caught him before
he could attack a human.

23:25.966 --> 23:28.866
Mmhmm.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.748
He's a little malnourished, see?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.600
You take a little more
nourishment and we'll let you out.

23:52.210 --> 23:55.378
You know, we considered
your mother a hero.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.318
Wasn't she a librarian?

23:57.320 --> 24:01.138
Yes, but she
was also a monster agent.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.140
Wow.

24:05.650 --> 24:07.548
See that?

24:07.550 --> 24:08.550
Mom.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.003
You're so much like her.

24:16.270 --> 24:19.343
Not a single day goes by
that I don't think of her.

24:21.630 --> 24:26.353
I miss her so much, since that
mission when she disappeared.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.358
What mission?

24:28.360 --> 24:29.360
Hm?

24:30.130 --> 24:31.878
A car accident?

24:31.880 --> 24:34.388
We wanted people to believe

24:34.390 --> 24:38.138
that she met her demise in a car accident.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.473
If only she hadn't been so stubborn.

24:41.410 --> 24:42.853
Then, what happened?

24:44.510 --> 24:49.510
There was a super-moon in
march, almost nine years ago.

24:52.470 --> 24:55.083
Your mother responded to a werewolf alarm,

24:56.310 --> 24:58.527
in the dark forest, alone.

25:00.701 --> 25:02.138
Alice!

25:02.140 --> 25:04.748
One should
never do that on their own.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.083
Alice!

25:09.810 --> 25:13.391
We followed
her and we searched for her.

25:13.393 --> 25:15.053
For a long time.

25:16.562 --> 25:18.040
Alice!

25:19.000 --> 25:20.543
But we never found her,

25:22.360 --> 25:23.360
your mama.

25:24.730 --> 25:25.743
I'm sorry.

25:32.570 --> 25:33.570
Look here.

25:38.121 --> 25:40.730
It was your mother's monster agent badge.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.508
What are you doing, saying
what you shouldn't say?

26:09.510 --> 26:10.341
What?

26:10.343 --> 26:11.658
Surely you haven't told her.

26:11.660 --> 26:14.218
Uh, told her what
exactly, what do you mean?

26:14.220 --> 26:16.708
Well, I've mentioned just a few things.

26:16.710 --> 26:17.708
What has been decided?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.528
We did decide that we should wait.

26:19.530 --> 26:20.648
We should wait.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.378
How long has she been here?

26:22.380 --> 26:25.280
One day, and then you start
blah blah blah blah blah blah.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.648
You come with me.

26:27.650 --> 26:28.818
You've seen too much already.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.768
But I want
to be a monster agent.

26:30.770 --> 26:32.263
Absolutely no way.

26:33.529 --> 26:35.198
There,

26:35.200 --> 26:36.583
get into the elevator.

26:44.026 --> 26:45.895
Right now,

26:45.897 --> 26:48.103
I want you to listen to me, concentrate.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.638
Look at the pocket watch.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.528
Follow it with your eyes.

26:54.530 --> 26:58.578
Breath deeply, forget
everything you have seen.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.143
I'm erasing your memory.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.108
You won't remember a thing and you...

27:03.110 --> 27:04.295
What are you doing?

27:04.297 --> 27:06.508
It never worked anyway.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.660
Just forget everything
you've seen, forget!

27:10.140 --> 27:11.140
And no nagging.

27:12.550 --> 27:13.628
This can't go on.

27:13.630 --> 27:16.243
More and more monsters are
showing up among people.

27:17.109 --> 27:19.568
Sorry to say, but no one's safe anymore.

27:19.570 --> 27:20.978
Tea?

27:20.980 --> 27:21.811
You know, I've
been saying for a long time...

27:21.813 --> 27:23.578
You know, I thought maybe

27:23.580 --> 27:26.788
you could let me become a
monster agent after all?

27:26.790 --> 27:28.148
Please Nelly, I'm busy.

27:28.150 --> 27:29.758
You can't just wander around the house.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.718
Do you want some candy?

27:31.720 --> 27:33.863
No more.

27:36.310 --> 27:39.248
That's not all, the world
is full of media reports,

27:39.250 --> 27:42.058
incidents that can only
be explained by one thing,

27:42.060 --> 27:43.778
monsters.

27:43.780 --> 27:45.648
A large woman abducts a child

27:45.650 --> 27:47.548
from a maternity ward.

27:47.550 --> 27:50.748
Oh my god, these are obviously trolls.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.058
The water spirit likes to entertain.

27:53.060 --> 27:53.891
- Hey.
- Huh?

27:53.893 --> 27:55.328
- Oh.
- Uh,

27:55.330 --> 27:59.113
you have to know, I really
feel ready to do this.

28:01.230 --> 28:02.088
- You shouldn't be here...
- But I'm ready...

28:02.090 --> 28:03.258
I told you so.

28:03.260 --> 28:06.038
Now do as I say, go
upstairs and stay there

28:06.040 --> 28:07.654
and don't come down again.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.158
Vincent says our old methods
aren't working anymore.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.158
Vincent?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.323
The monsters are more active than ever.

28:17.450 --> 28:19.448
He has called for a crisis meeting.

28:19.450 --> 28:21.448
He has a new idea that he wants to present

28:21.450 --> 28:22.723
and put into action.

28:24.085 --> 28:26.358
Ug, you don't
think he's exaggerating?

28:26.360 --> 28:27.468
Absolutely not at all,

28:27.470 --> 28:29.368
he's the one who's got the big picture.

28:29.370 --> 28:32.128
All right, okay, you
call a crisis meeting.

28:32.130 --> 28:33.790
Then we'll see where that gets us.

28:33.792 --> 28:34.623
Yeah.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.768
Nothing good, I'm sure.

28:35.770 --> 28:37.370
You see, I have no faith in him.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.523
I think that sometimes he's a,

28:41.730 --> 28:44.538
bit of a drama queen, hm?

28:44.540 --> 28:49.383
Let him come and, we'll see
what Vincent has to say.

28:50.505 --> 28:51.336
What?

28:51.338 --> 28:52.437
If he actually shows up.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.248
What was that all about?

28:54.250 --> 28:55.573
What was all that winking?

28:56.660 --> 28:57.693
Did I see you wink?

29:22.248 --> 29:27.108
Now Nelly, we're having
a monster agent meeting.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.118
Bunch of strange cars.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.038
But it's just a cover.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.698
We can't let people know
that we're monster agents,

29:33.700 --> 29:35.518
so we have to have other jobs.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.653
Then people think that's what we do.

29:39.790 --> 29:42.238
And so what's your cover?

29:42.240 --> 29:44.548
I'm a retired teacher,

29:44.550 --> 29:45.583
just like Hannibal.

29:46.490 --> 29:48.008
He took early retirement.

29:48.010 --> 29:49.939
He thinks it's classy.

30:23.303 --> 30:24.918
Who's that?

30:24.920 --> 30:26.588
Vincent,

30:26.590 --> 30:28.548
he's become the most important person

30:28.550 --> 30:31.828
in the monster agent
council, so important.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.748
You could say he's our boss.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.918
What's his cover?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.478
He's a life coach.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.668
What's that?

30:37.670 --> 30:38.758
I don't know.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.760
Come on.

30:43.330 --> 30:45.313
Wait here, wait.

30:47.780 --> 30:51.418
Lena-sleva, it's been a long time.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.508
Nice to see you.

30:53.510 --> 30:54.558
Welcome.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.618
Sorry, I thought I saw a ghost.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.778
Is that Alice's daughter?

30:59.780 --> 31:01.383
Yes, Nelly.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.658
Aren't they alike?

31:03.660 --> 31:04.491
Definitely.

31:04.493 --> 31:05.493
Hello.

31:08.330 --> 31:10.833
Wow, great place.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.761
I could happily live here.

31:13.763 --> 31:16.948
Yeah, we do our best.

31:16.950 --> 31:20.198
I couldn't help but notice
outside your beautiful Porsche,

31:20.200 --> 31:21.218
what year is it?

31:21.220 --> 31:22.051
'85.

31:22.053 --> 31:23.688
- Of course.
- Mmhmm.

31:23.690 --> 31:24.521
And the engine?

31:24.523 --> 31:25.588
3.3 liters.

31:25.590 --> 31:26.421
Turbo charged?

31:26.423 --> 31:27.268
Of course.

31:27.270 --> 31:28.101
Rims?

31:28.103 --> 31:28.934
Split.

31:28.936 --> 31:30.071
Of course.

31:32.430 --> 31:33.788
Oh, not now.

31:33.790 --> 31:38.018
Uh, monster alarm, we have
activity in sector three.

31:38.020 --> 31:41.188
We'll take my car,
I have several uniforms.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.981
Let's go,
mission military exercise.

31:48.930 --> 31:51.158
Hey, I'll come with you, Hannibal.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.323
Watch out, next time.

32:25.891 --> 32:28.241
No London, come back.

32:28.243 --> 32:29.743
London, come back!

32:38.610 --> 32:40.060
It's hiding by the garbage.

32:42.051 --> 32:44.418
A Frankenstein-er,
wandering around in public.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.288
It's breaking all the rules.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.340
But yes.

32:48.280 --> 32:49.280
What's going on?

32:50.460 --> 32:54.018
Today is our uh, army training day.

32:54.020 --> 32:55.432
Bolas.

32:55.434 --> 32:56.265
Here they are.

32:56.267 --> 32:57.278
You're going to use bolas?

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
Yes.

32:59.458 --> 33:00.458
Ah, yee haw!

33:10.450 --> 33:13.128
Is this what
our taxes are used for?

33:13.130 --> 33:14.858
Absolutely.

33:14.860 --> 33:15.860
London, stop!

33:41.699 --> 33:45.646
No London, come, not that way!

33:45.648 --> 33:50.648
London!

33:51.168 --> 33:52.714
London.

33:57.877 --> 33:59.305
London, come.

34:09.466 --> 34:10.466
London.

34:44.109 --> 34:46.993
Vincent, forget about it.

34:47.950 --> 34:51.803
It's exactly like you said,
our old methods no longer work.

34:52.680 --> 34:55.288
Let's regroup and focus on the meeting.

34:55.290 --> 34:58.190
We're all looking forward to
hearing more about your idea.

35:01.388 --> 35:02.388
Huh?

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
London.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.580
There you are, London.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.851
Professor Stein.

36:07.351 --> 36:08.816
London!

36:08.818 --> 36:10.640
London!

36:15.013 --> 36:16.293
London, come on.

36:19.042 --> 36:24.042
London!

36:40.070 --> 36:41.153
No no no, no.

37:06.179 --> 37:07.179
London, run!

37:09.370 --> 37:10.643
What, what was she?

37:15.390 --> 37:16.448
Well, what are we going to do?

37:16.450 --> 37:19.108
We can't work any harder
than we already do.

37:19.110 --> 37:22.628
Two of my agents are now
suffering from burnout.

37:22.630 --> 37:24.748
But do we really know that the monsters

37:24.750 --> 37:26.348
have become harder to catch?

37:26.350 --> 37:31.008
Well, you can ask Hannibal
and Lena-sleva, I don't know.

37:31.010 --> 37:33.558
You've been chasing a
werewolf for six months now,

37:33.560 --> 37:34.438
am I right?

37:34.440 --> 37:38.928
Yes, we have because it's very fast.

37:38.930 --> 37:39.930
I'll take this one.

37:42.983 --> 37:43.983
Oh dear.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.880
Where did it go?

37:49.080 --> 37:50.528
But is it right that poor you

37:50.530 --> 37:51.988
should have to run and get sweaty

37:51.990 --> 37:53.873
just because they cause a problem?

37:55.470 --> 37:58.043
No, it's time for new ideas.

37:58.950 --> 37:59.908
Yes.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.458
And that's what this presentation

38:01.460 --> 38:03.278
is going to be all about.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.293
It's a story about a little boy.

38:07.210 --> 38:10.048
Not a day goes by
without him being bullied

38:10.050 --> 38:13.178
or teased or mocked.

38:13.180 --> 38:16.845
No one liked him, not even
his own mother like him.

38:16.847 --> 38:19.478
"You're so ugly," she said.

38:19.480 --> 38:23.048
But he's strong, the boy is strong.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.358
He no longer wants to live in the shadows.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.598
He decided to change
his life for the better

38:27.600 --> 38:30.188
and he chose happiness.

38:30.190 --> 38:32.923
And this boy, that was me.

38:36.470 --> 38:38.856
He's such a drama queen.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.689
Right.

38:39.691 --> 38:44.288
No matter how brutal,
maladjusted or disgusting they are,

38:44.290 --> 38:47.388
surely everyone can change.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.903
Monsters, a huge problem in society.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.668
Monster agents have been
fighting them for generations,

38:54.670 --> 38:57.168
but the question is, are the old methods,

38:57.170 --> 38:59.278
in fact, still working?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.473
The answer is, no.

39:02.460 --> 39:05.178
The new, state-of-the-art,
total care center

39:05.180 --> 39:09.178
combats monsters with high-tech,
cost-effective methods.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.888
Here, patients are treated

39:10.890 --> 39:14.268
with the very latest
normalization techniques.

39:14.270 --> 39:16.158
Please try some broccoli.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.819
You won't get anymore human brains.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.148
Our cosmetic expertise is world-class.

39:23.150 --> 39:25.683
A werewolf's horrifying
hands can be fixed.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.723
A vampire's scary smile
can, of course, be treated.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.273
Our producers will make
them as human as possible.

39:35.280 --> 39:39.383
Total care center, for a world
free of grotesque monsters.

39:48.872 --> 39:49.872
What do you think?

39:51.041 --> 39:52.102
Was it bad?

39:52.104 --> 39:52.935
No no no.

39:52.937 --> 39:54.138
I should've lowered my voice a little,

39:54.140 --> 39:56.778
total care center, huh?

39:56.780 --> 39:58.688
No, no it was, it was fine.

39:58.690 --> 39:59.788
Tell me.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.408
Well, I don't know.

40:01.410 --> 40:04.360
Uh, this thing you expressed,
about making everyone fit in,

40:06.440 --> 40:07.688
or those who don't.

40:07.690 --> 40:09.238
I think you're right,
I think it's possible.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.048
We're gonna face a lot of obstacles,

40:11.050 --> 40:14.383
but I need all your monster
agents to do their part.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.330
And I need you,

40:18.420 --> 40:20.770
and all of your monster
agents to come through.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.998
I'm in.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Yes.

40:28.010 --> 40:30.933
Today's monsters are more
brutal than ever before.

40:57.990 --> 41:01.898
Werewolf, half wolf, half human.

41:01.900 --> 41:06.493
Transformation happens
during a full moon, once me.

41:08.580 --> 41:13.028
Ghosts, can't, want to
depart from this world.

41:13.030 --> 41:17.233
Vampires, can't stand
sunlight, drink blood.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.238
A Frankenstein-er is
a monster put together

41:31.240 --> 41:33.858
from different body parts.

41:33.860 --> 41:37.038
Their head, legs and arms
are stitched together,

41:37.040 --> 41:39.778
making a completely new creature.

41:39.780 --> 41:42.278
That's why they're called poly-corpus,

41:42.280 --> 41:46.738
poly means many and corpus means body.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.498
In order to bring the creature to life,

41:49.500 --> 41:54.500
a laboratory is required and
also very strong electricity

41:54.650 --> 41:57.568
as one would find in
lightening, for example.

41:57.570 --> 42:00.518
One of the many problems
with Frankenstein-ers

42:00.520 --> 42:02.858
is that they lack a natural link

42:02.860 --> 42:05.828
between their heart and their brain.

42:05.830 --> 42:08.978
In addition, they are incredibly strong.

42:08.980 --> 42:12.813
For that reason, they can be
ruthless and very dangerous.

42:19.420 --> 42:23.288
If I say to you that total
care center is the solution,

42:23.290 --> 42:24.238
what say you?

42:24.240 --> 42:25.378
Yes.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.522
Do you want it?

42:26.524 --> 42:27.355
Yes.

42:27.357 --> 42:28.188
I said, do you want it?

42:28.190 --> 42:29.088
Yes!

42:29.090 --> 42:30.330
I can't hear you!

42:31.282 --> 42:32.459
Can't hear you!

42:33.930 --> 42:34.930
All right!

42:54.350 --> 42:55.378
I'll show Hannibal

42:55.380 --> 43:00.213
that I am ready to become a
monster agent, just like you.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.900
Come on, London, let's go
catch a Frankenstein-er.

43:57.490 --> 43:59.480
It's very dark.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.330
Come on, London.

45:34.767 --> 45:37.535
Go away, ha!

45:37.537 --> 45:38.537
Go, be gone!

46:16.160 --> 46:17.243
Just lie still.

46:22.810 --> 46:23.810
Where's London?

46:25.920 --> 46:27.618
London, I thought you were...

46:27.620 --> 46:28.620
Lie still.

46:41.390 --> 46:42.540
Try to rest.

48:11.717 --> 48:13.134
Yes, here you go.

48:15.386 --> 48:16.386
Yes.

48:18.620 --> 48:19.620
Good doggy.

48:24.540 --> 48:25.840
Come, come here, London.

48:34.050 --> 48:35.253
What are you baking?

48:39.290 --> 48:43.508
Okay, but thanks for saving
me from the werewolf.

48:43.510 --> 48:46.213
And I'm sorry I tried
to catch you yesterday.

48:47.130 --> 48:49.863
So, can you tell me what
you're going to be baking?

48:50.850 --> 48:51.850
Cookies.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.313
Uh, cookies and jam.

48:57.740 --> 49:00.783
I have the heart of a pastry chef.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.983
Tell me, are you really
a Frankenstein-er girl?

49:09.811 --> 49:11.425
Hm.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.338
So, I guess you live here.

49:17.340 --> 49:19.518
I mean, how long have you live here?

49:19.520 --> 49:22.158
Did they put you together here?

49:22.160 --> 49:24.568
I was born in the laboratory.

49:24.570 --> 49:25.970
In the laboratory?

49:27.130 --> 49:28.173
In the cellar.

49:29.870 --> 49:30.870
Can I see it?

49:33.010 --> 49:34.010
Okay.

49:43.660 --> 49:44.491
Vincent.

49:44.493 --> 49:45.493
Hannibal.

49:50.270 --> 49:54.048
It's gonna be a success,
total care center.

49:54.050 --> 49:57.533
No more monsters in the house.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.553
- Are you with me?
- Oh, absolutely.

50:03.693 --> 50:05.458
Mm.

50:05.460 --> 50:09.203
I must say, it's great
having gotten to know you.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.348
May I invite you to have dinner with me

50:12.350 --> 50:13.873
when all of this is over?

50:15.160 --> 50:16.818
I'll take you to a little place

50:16.820 --> 50:20.008
that specializes in
serving a kind of pizza.

50:20.010 --> 50:24.758
They have four Chinese dishes
rolled into it, most unusual.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.788
Sweet and sour sauce,
nuts, deep fried prawns,

50:27.790 --> 50:31.868
stir fried chicken, folded
inside it like a surprise.

50:31.870 --> 50:33.848
It's a sort of crossover kitchen.

50:33.850 --> 50:37.168
Know what, I'll book it now, right now.

50:37.170 --> 50:38.208
You really will?

50:38.210 --> 50:39.210
Yes.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.070
Let's do it.

50:41.840 --> 50:42.840
Let's do it tonight.

50:44.580 --> 50:45.778
Am I interrupting?

50:45.780 --> 50:46.913
Yes, a little.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.143
No, not at all, come in.

50:50.840 --> 50:53.383
I'm booking a car to total care center.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.560
Let's do it.

50:57.850 --> 50:58.818
Okay.

50:58.820 --> 51:00.420
Have the car here at 7:00 P.M.

51:04.370 --> 51:05.795
Have you seen Nelly?

51:16.090 --> 51:17.778
My mom built me here

51:17.780 --> 51:21.158
in the laboratory a long time ago.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.878
Is your name Roberta?

51:22.880 --> 51:23.778
Yes.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.943
My name's Nelly.

51:27.980 --> 51:31.353
But the drawing is more
than 100 years old.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.060
Tell me, how old are you supposed to be?

51:42.150 --> 51:43.150
Old.

52:18.110 --> 52:19.110
Come to mama.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.280
Come.

52:22.972 --> 52:27.223
Yes, go, careful, careful, you can do it.

52:29.054 --> 52:31.348
Well done!

52:31.350 --> 52:33.278
My mother, the professor,

52:33.280 --> 52:35.838
thought I was a beautiful child,

52:35.840 --> 52:38.523
the most beautiful she had ever seen.

52:50.320 --> 52:54.043
She wanted me to be normal
and have a profession.

52:57.220 --> 53:01.278
This heart belonged to a
very talented pastry chef.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.838
Now you're going to learn to bake.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.333
Won't that be nice?

53:06.180 --> 53:08.753
Mother had a
lot of Patience with me.

53:09.870 --> 53:11.068
Oh Roberta.

53:11.070 --> 53:12.083
Uh, mm.

53:13.720 --> 53:16.753
It took me many years to learn to bake.

53:20.210 --> 53:21.210
Mm.

53:21.930 --> 53:25.335
Oh my, they're beautiful.

53:27.487 --> 53:31.346
We decided
to open a cafe together.

53:35.760 --> 53:39.503
But my mom had grown very old.

53:44.910 --> 53:46.303
But I didn't.

54:21.410 --> 54:23.663
When she was no longer here,

54:24.770 --> 54:27.913
everything became very quiet.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.433
The cafe never opened.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.988
I don't have a mom either.

54:41.990 --> 54:44.088
She died when I was little.

54:44.090 --> 54:46.928
We never got to know each other at all.

54:46.930 --> 54:48.313
What is that?

54:49.210 --> 54:50.523
It's a, um um,

54:51.440 --> 54:53.503
well, my mom was a,

54:54.540 --> 54:56.173
hero to some people,

54:57.230 --> 54:58.973
and they gave her this medal.

55:00.220 --> 55:01.973
You know, you look like her.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.263
I would like to be just like her.

55:09.130 --> 55:13.293
But my dad wants me to
be completely ordinary.

55:14.430 --> 55:18.298
He always says, "try to
tone it down a bit, Nelly."

55:18.300 --> 55:21.913
He's probably just worried
I'll be all by my lonesome.

55:31.040 --> 55:32.133
Are you a sad girl?

55:35.310 --> 55:37.168
Don't take this the wrong way, Roberta,

55:37.170 --> 55:40.158
but I thought that you didn't have a link

55:40.160 --> 55:42.143
between your heart and your brain.

55:43.210 --> 55:46.278
That was in a book that I read, so,

55:46.280 --> 55:48.478
of course I thought that you were

55:48.480 --> 55:50.230
a really dangerous Frankenstein-er.

55:52.730 --> 55:54.113
But I see I was wrong.

55:58.580 --> 56:00.473
Do you have any monster friends?

56:03.350 --> 56:07.838
Back in the 1980's,
we used to have parties.

56:07.840 --> 56:10.348
We loved to dance.

56:10.350 --> 56:11.968
But not anymore?

56:11.970 --> 56:12.918
No,

56:12.920 --> 56:16.588
all monsters are quite
different from each other,

56:16.590 --> 56:19.863
but most of them want to
be with their own kind.

56:22.290 --> 56:24.908
This is really so sad.

56:24.910 --> 56:26.658
What if you end up having to be alone here

56:26.660 --> 56:28.383
for another 100 years?

56:30.870 --> 56:32.953
I think you should open your cafe.

56:34.310 --> 56:36.008
'Cause it's your dream.

56:36.010 --> 56:38.043
Your mom would be really happy about it.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.508
You gotta dare to try.

56:41.510 --> 56:44.583
People can change, and monsters too.

56:45.570 --> 56:47.583
And Roberta, I'll be here to help you.

56:48.640 --> 56:49.640
Let's see it.

56:54.690 --> 56:55.690
Welcome

56:58.170 --> 56:59.588
to

56:59.590 --> 57:00.753
Tea and cakes

57:02.540 --> 57:04.083
at Roberta's.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.457
Is he a vampire?

57:18.459 --> 57:19.709
Mmhmm, mmhmm.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.318
Hi, it's Lucas.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.320
Hi mom.

57:25.140 --> 57:27.670
Give me an invitation.

57:34.450 --> 57:37.878
That's vanja, the werewolf
you met in the forest.

57:37.880 --> 57:38.880
What?

57:40.070 --> 57:42.278
The werewolf works at the hot dog stand?

57:42.280 --> 57:46.028
Yes, but the only time she's dangerous

57:46.030 --> 57:47.433
is when the moon's full.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.010
Okay, let's invite her.

57:54.510 --> 57:56.498
It's just
a normal little pimple,

57:56.500 --> 57:58.658
no one's going to notice it.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.868
Are you joking?

57:59.870 --> 58:01.848
It looks like I have a flashing red light

58:01.850 --> 58:03.608
in the middle of my face.

58:03.610 --> 58:05.038
Well excuse me,

58:05.040 --> 58:07.698
but I don't think anyone's
going to notice the pimple

58:07.700 --> 58:10.123
when they see the knife in your stomach.

58:15.830 --> 58:18.948
Dearest god in heaven, please, please,

58:18.950 --> 58:21.208
remove this horrible blemish...

58:21.210 --> 58:22.638
Amen.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.070
- What?
- Quick, say amen.

58:24.072 --> 58:27.537
Amen.

58:43.121 --> 58:44.967
Come on, one more time.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.225
Vincent speaking.

59:58.227 --> 1:00:00.388
Hi, it's Eva from total care center.

1:00:00.390 --> 1:00:02.738
They're not adjusting as planned.

1:00:02.740 --> 1:00:05.428
They don't seem to feel quite well.

1:00:05.430 --> 1:00:07.273
I can't put my finger on it.

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.298
Okay, what's the problem?

1:00:10.300 --> 1:00:13.408
What if we took away
too much of their brains?

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:14.818
Nah, it's fine,

1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:16.818
we're bringing the other bunch tonight.

1:00:16.820 --> 1:00:17.651
I'm worried that

1:00:17.653 --> 1:00:20.108
we won't be able to
release them into society.

1:00:20.110 --> 1:00:22.761
We have to
eliminate the difficult ones.

1:00:24.324 --> 1:00:25.361
Eliminate?

1:00:25.363 --> 1:00:27.603
Yes, you know, chop chop.

1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:30.388
Are we going to kill them?

1:00:30.390 --> 1:00:31.390
Vincent.

1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:34.828
Yeah?

1:00:34.830 --> 1:00:35.938
We are ready downstairs.

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:36.940
Very good.

1:00:37.790 --> 1:00:39.063
Ready.

1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:17.268
Friends, we
have monsters to catch.

1:01:17.270 --> 1:01:19.358
Look for them everywhere.

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:21.008
We're going to catch them all

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:23.488
and we're going to make them fit in.

1:01:23.490 --> 1:01:24.490
Let's do it.

1:01:34.927 --> 1:01:36.168
That figures.

1:01:36.170 --> 1:01:37.678
I can get some more.

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:39.318
They've probably got some at the house.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:40.398
Hey wait.

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:41.400
What's up?

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:54.673
Roberta, there's something I have to say.

1:01:56.710 --> 1:01:57.710
Hm?

1:01:58.650 --> 1:02:00.768
You see, I am,

1:02:00.770 --> 1:02:03.068
well the truth is, I'm not,

1:02:03.070 --> 1:02:06.070
not yet, but I'm hoping to become

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.298
maybe you'll call me a, something like,

1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:13.300
if I'm chosen.

1:02:15.390 --> 1:02:17.268
Just like my mom was.

1:02:17.270 --> 1:02:19.328
- Or...
- Tell me later.

1:02:19.330 --> 1:02:21.978
The guests will be here soon.

1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:23.713
Go get some more paint.

1:02:45.390 --> 1:02:46.481
The hot dog stand is closed,

1:02:46.483 --> 1:02:49.029
there's no sign of the werewolf, copy.

1:02:49.031 --> 1:02:51.531
Hm?

1:02:53.510 --> 1:02:55.778
Hotdog wrap with extra everything.

1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:57.730
It's closed, no one's here right now.

1:02:59.270 --> 1:03:00.563
Yeah, but you're here.

1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:03.040
I'm not.

1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:06.308
Come on.

1:03:06.310 --> 1:03:07.958
Okay, so what did you want again?

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:10.011
Hotdog wrap with extra everything.

1:03:29.151 --> 1:03:30.508
What are you doing there?

1:03:30.510 --> 1:03:35.248
Uh, we're doing some
work on the electricity.

1:03:35.250 --> 1:03:36.250
We have a,

1:03:37.311 --> 1:03:41.943
a, uh huh, there it is.

1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:47.348
We are all gathered here today,

1:03:47.350 --> 1:03:48.673
people,

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.618
the little one is being surprised,

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.273
I mean baptized and it will be named,

1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:57.828
what name again?

1:03:57.830 --> 1:04:02.139
Extra everything.

1:04:04.860 --> 1:04:06.203
And ice cream.

1:04:08.390 --> 1:04:09.390
Pickled cucumber.

1:04:11.291 --> 1:04:12.921
Hm.

1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:16.060
It's for you.

1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:24.163
Empty.

1:04:25.610 --> 1:04:26.738
There's no one here,

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.648
so I'll just put the
mail through this slot.

1:04:29.650 --> 1:04:31.918
That's usually where the
mail is supposed to go.

1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:32.848
How are you doing?

1:04:32.850 --> 1:04:34.588
Soon finished.

1:04:34.590 --> 1:04:37.768
The source of the problem is right here.

1:04:37.770 --> 1:04:40.578
Uh, I just cut it off.

1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:43.048
That does it, yeah.

1:04:43.050 --> 1:04:47.348
I say the name, with water on the head,

1:04:47.350 --> 1:04:48.878
- I baptize you...
- Who are you?

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:50.219
Corina.

1:04:50.221 --> 1:04:52.093
- Uh...
- Corina bergstrom.

1:04:53.270 --> 1:04:54.841
Oh, that's my name.

1:04:54.843 --> 1:04:56.841
Woop, hold on.

1:04:56.843 --> 1:04:59.703
Yeah, I'm connected, I knew it.

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:06.048
With the lord, the lord.

1:05:06.050 --> 1:05:07.588
Sometimes he contacts me,

1:05:07.590 --> 1:05:09.938
but he's always so pushy.

1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:11.513
Mm, hallelujah.

1:05:17.810 --> 1:05:19.060
Look here.

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:23.760
Frankenstein-er.

1:05:29.260 --> 1:05:30.260
And here.

1:05:31.350 --> 1:05:33.503
Human footprints, small feet.

1:05:35.963 --> 1:05:36.963
Ah, come.

1:05:49.730 --> 1:05:51.958
So you haven't heard
of the sisters of mercy?

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:52.791
Mm mm.

1:05:52.793 --> 1:05:55.958
Ah, mm, well, the first album

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:58.998
was first and last and always in 1985.

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.138
Flood land was released in 1987

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:03.921
and then vision thing in 1990.

1:06:05.260 --> 1:06:07.443
This is dead boring, let's go.

1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:12.538
Come on, maybe
there's gonna be a party.

1:06:12.540 --> 1:06:15.093
Party, it sounds more like a funeral.

1:06:16.950 --> 1:06:19.913
Our funeral was a lot
more fun than this is.

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:23.213
But we haven't had a funeral.

1:06:24.670 --> 1:06:27.068
Oh, she doesn't know she's dead.

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:28.070
Oops, yeah.

1:06:28.930 --> 1:06:30.318
Can you see my blemish?

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:31.543
Yes, definitely.

1:06:35.410 --> 1:06:40.038
Uh, everyone, please
help yourself to cookies.

1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:42.358
- Finally.
- Uh, excuse me,

1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:45.008
but I don't understand
what we're doing here.

1:06:45.010 --> 1:06:46.258
We're eating.

1:06:46.260 --> 1:06:47.518
Okay.

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:50.158
I've asked you all to come here tonight

1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:52.230
because I'm thinking of opening

1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:57.558
a small, but very friendly cafe.

1:06:57.560 --> 1:06:58.560
I see.

1:06:59.310 --> 1:07:01.268
What's that got to do with us?

1:07:01.270 --> 1:07:04.668
Well, we thought that maybe

1:07:04.670 --> 1:07:09.136
you would be interested in helping us out.

1:07:09.138 --> 1:07:11.368
Help out, I can cook hot dogs.

1:07:11.370 --> 1:07:13.198
I'm good at eating, but I don't bake.

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:16.778
Exactly who did you think
would come to this cafe?

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:19.328
Other monsters, or what?

1:07:19.330 --> 1:07:22.435
Or did you
think maybe some humans?

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.353
Hang on, I can
smell something in the air.

1:07:44.780 --> 1:07:45.780
Werewolf.

1:07:47.170 --> 1:07:48.643
And ghosts too.

1:07:50.710 --> 1:07:53.693
Everyone was heading in
the same direction, here.

1:07:56.140 --> 1:07:57.678
I'll call Vincent.

1:07:57.680 --> 1:07:58.680
Hannibal to Vincent.

1:08:00.910 --> 1:08:03.698
Nelly, wanna come,
it's gonna be exciting.

1:08:03.700 --> 1:08:04.531
Why is that?

1:08:04.533 --> 1:08:06.628
We know there are
monsters in the forest.

1:08:06.630 --> 1:08:09.393
They're all gathered together
and we're gonna catch them.

1:08:10.470 --> 1:08:12.908
You've got agent blood in your veins.

1:08:12.910 --> 1:08:13.910
Wanna come?

1:08:15.420 --> 1:08:18.333
We're getting rid of
them once and for all.

1:08:21.998 --> 1:08:22.998
Roberta.

1:08:32.197 --> 1:08:34.912
Here.

1:08:42.069 --> 1:08:43.069
It's not blood.

1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:46.038
I'm a vegan.

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.327
It's okay, I take these
iron supplements, mmhmm.

1:08:53.380 --> 1:08:56.308
My family doesn't understand
why I don't drink blood.

1:08:56.310 --> 1:08:59.507
They're like, "what's wrong,
wanna be malnourished?"

1:08:59.509 --> 1:09:02.572
Mm, I'm glad they moved to transylvania.

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:06.757
But not you?

1:09:06.759 --> 1:09:09.917
No, not my thing, never was.

1:09:09.919 --> 1:09:13.218
The whole Dracula life, oh,
living in an old castle,

1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:15.492
wearing a cape, it's so not me.

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.427
But I would like to help out

1:09:20.429 --> 1:09:23.038
with the cafe you were talking about.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:24.438
Hm.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:25.698
If you want.

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:26.700
Me too.

1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:31.361
I'm what you call a spoon licker.

1:09:33.349 --> 1:09:34.417
Thanks.

1:09:34.419 --> 1:09:35.738
Should I put some music on?

1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:37.242
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah?

1:09:40.980 --> 1:09:42.080
What's on your mind?

1:09:43.650 --> 1:09:44.998
My Nellie.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.200
Who's that?

1:09:48.679 --> 1:09:52.111
My new friend.

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.837
Really bad song.

1:10:10.839 --> 1:10:12.638
This is not helping.

1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:14.768
It sounds sad.

1:10:14.770 --> 1:10:17.273
This is going
to make everybody leave.

1:10:23.050 --> 1:10:25.652
He should play
something we can dance to.

1:10:25.654 --> 1:10:27.071
Right.

1:12:01.470 --> 1:12:02.301
Be quiet!

1:12:02.303 --> 1:12:04.167
Nelly's in there.

1:12:04.169 --> 1:12:06.188
Has she gathered them all together?

1:12:06.190 --> 1:12:07.190
Let me see.

1:12:09.290 --> 1:12:10.148
Incredible.

1:12:10.150 --> 1:12:12.708
You need to get away, now!

1:12:12.710 --> 1:12:14.398
I haven't got time to explain,

1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:16.608
but some monster agents
are coming to catch you.

1:12:16.610 --> 1:12:17.677
Run, hurry up!

1:12:47.291 --> 1:12:51.279
After her!

1:13:45.279 --> 1:13:48.408
You have to let her go,
she hasn't done anything.

1:13:48.410 --> 1:13:49.478
What, what do you mean?

1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:51.498
Disgusting freak.

1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:54.898
Let me go!

1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:55.967
You can't take her!

1:13:55.969 --> 1:13:57.009
Nelly!

1:13:57.011 --> 1:13:58.011
Nelly!

1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:00.080
Nelly!

1:14:01.782 --> 1:14:03.647
Nelly...

1:14:03.649 --> 1:14:05.247
Nelly Nelly,

1:14:05.249 --> 1:14:06.780
what are you doing?

1:14:06.782 --> 1:14:07.782
Nelly!

1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:12.230
Nelly, Nelly!

1:14:12.232 --> 1:14:14.114
Nelly!

1:14:14.116 --> 1:14:17.198
Stop her, stop her now!

1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:25.289
Put it down, oh, put it down, quick!

1:14:25.291 --> 1:14:29.190
Okay, center.

1:14:44.111 --> 1:14:45.111
Damn!

1:15:14.919 --> 1:15:16.969
Roberta, it's only me.

1:15:56.521 --> 1:16:01.521
Oh gosh!

1:16:01.681 --> 1:16:02.681
Okay.

1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:05.940
It's stuck!

1:16:08.252 --> 1:16:10.348
No, Roberta, don't!

1:16:10.350 --> 1:16:13.058
Okay.

1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:15.078
Roberta, please stop.

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:18.888
I'm a monster, don't come near me!

1:16:20.687 --> 1:16:23.024
- Stop Roberta!
- Nelly!

1:16:23.026 --> 1:16:24.563
You've gotta
stop, please please.

1:16:24.565 --> 1:16:25.902
You've gotta stop.

1:16:25.904 --> 1:16:28.140
Roberta, please stop.

1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:31.493
Hey hey, Roberta, you've gotta stop.

1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:34.082
Don't do anything stupid.

1:16:34.084 --> 1:16:35.257
Hey hey,

1:16:35.259 --> 1:16:36.257
I'll make you beautiful.

1:16:36.259 --> 1:16:38.243
You're a monster, but I can fix that.

1:16:39.285 --> 1:16:40.593
Please Roberta, don't do it.

1:16:41.923 --> 1:16:43.667
You're my friend, Roberta,

1:16:43.669 --> 1:16:46.443
my only true friend.

1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:51.267
I really like you.

1:16:52.710 --> 1:16:55.543
Don't do it, please please don't do it.

1:17:00.630 --> 1:17:04.245
Please Roberta, do it
for me, you're my friend.

1:17:47.270 --> 1:17:51.020
I'm sorry, I should have
told you everything.

1:17:51.990 --> 1:17:52.990
I'm sorry.

1:17:56.830 --> 1:17:58.348
Come on.

1:18:05.562 --> 1:18:09.698
I thought I wanted to be a
monster agent, just like you,

1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:10.933
just like my mom,

1:18:11.990 --> 1:18:14.837
but if that means that
anyone who's different

1:18:14.839 --> 1:18:16.303
isn't allowed to exist,

1:18:17.870 --> 1:18:19.783
that you're not allowed to exist,

1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:22.943
that changed my mind.

1:18:34.337 --> 1:18:37.307
Why...

1:18:39.958 --> 1:18:40.958
Look out!

1:18:49.830 --> 1:18:51.388
Hannibal,

1:18:51.390 --> 1:18:52.883
you're just a fricken coward!

1:19:16.870 --> 1:19:18.093
What are you staring at?

1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:23.123
Stop staring at me!

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:26.293
I'm not afraid of you.

1:19:27.461 --> 1:19:30.308
I don't need you, I don't
need any of you, get it?

1:19:30.310 --> 1:19:32.328
Freaking monster huggers.

1:19:32.330 --> 1:19:33.768
No, you don't even get it,

1:19:33.770 --> 1:19:36.208
you don't understand what we're doing!

1:19:36.210 --> 1:19:39.558
You have no idea how
fantastic it could be.

1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:41.448
You blithering idiots!

1:19:41.450 --> 1:19:44.618
I'm surrounded by blithering idiots!

1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:46.648
How am I supposed to build something great

1:19:46.650 --> 1:19:50.540
when everyone around me
is a total idiot, huh?

1:19:51.660 --> 1:19:52.978
Huh?

1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:57.023
You're all crazy, just plain nuts!

1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:00.640
I thank you.

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:14.843
He's actually a bit of uh,

1:20:15.891 --> 1:20:17.018
what did you call him?

1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:18.649
Drama queen.

1:20:18.651 --> 1:20:21.463
Exactly, a drama queen.

1:20:24.089 --> 1:20:27.198
Well my dear fellow agents,

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:30.243
what does it in fact mean to be different?

1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:33.798
What does it mean to be normal?

1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:35.507
Am I normal?

1:20:35.509 --> 1:20:37.788
- No.
- Yes, I would say that I am.

1:20:37.790 --> 1:20:40.208
Hannibal is normal.

1:20:40.210 --> 1:20:43.768
No way, I'm not talking
about just his appearance,

1:20:43.770 --> 1:20:48.553
his whole personality is just
strange, be that as it may.

1:20:50.070 --> 1:20:53.683
Perhaps that also explains
why I like him so much.

1:20:55.940 --> 1:20:57.183
Thank you, Lena-sleva.

1:21:07.350 --> 1:21:10.518
Our mission is to protect
the world from monsters

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.708
and monsters from the world,

1:21:12.710 --> 1:21:15.713
but not to decide who is
allowed to exist in the world.

1:21:18.500 --> 1:21:21.973
Nelly rapp, come here.

1:21:27.232 --> 1:21:30.913
You're small,

1:21:31.870 --> 1:21:33.100
but your heart is big

1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:38.118
and all of your actions
have reminded each of us

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:39.803
of who we really want to be.

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:44.507
There ought to be more monster agents

1:21:44.509 --> 1:21:46.683
and more people like you.

1:21:47.930 --> 1:21:51.453
And therefore, I hope, with all my heart,

1:21:52.950 --> 1:21:57.433
that you will want to wear
your very own agent badge.

1:21:59.691 --> 1:22:03.283
And you'll wear it with pride.

1:22:04.272 --> 1:22:05.818
Yeah.

1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:07.123
You're a monster agent.

1:22:26.986 --> 1:22:29.270
Hey.

1:22:29.272 --> 1:22:34.272
Oh, oh I've missed you so much.

1:22:36.230 --> 1:22:37.273
Is everything okay?

1:22:38.950 --> 1:22:42.007
Yeah, yes you should
know one thing, lennart,

1:22:42.009 --> 1:22:45.663
Nelly is, she is an incredible person.

1:22:46.934 --> 1:22:48.268
Oh.

1:22:48.270 --> 1:22:49.383
Hey, what's this?

1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:53.268
I thought she should have
one of those like Alice had.

1:22:53.270 --> 1:22:54.573
It's a family tradition.

1:22:55.650 --> 1:22:57.430
Huh, thanks for the week.

1:22:57.432 --> 1:22:59.778
Oh.

1:22:59.780 --> 1:23:01.190
We'll keep in touch, huh?

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:10.608
Sweetie, if you ever need me,

1:23:10.610 --> 1:23:12.060
you'll know where to find me.

1:23:12.973 --> 1:23:14.372
Hide it.

1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:21.393
Oh.

1:23:22.890 --> 1:23:24.053
Take care, sweetie.

1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:28.738
Hop in.

1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:29.743
Oh, watch your tail.

1:23:34.190 --> 1:23:35.339
Bye bye.

1:23:41.860 --> 1:23:42.860
Well,

1:23:43.630 --> 1:23:47.213
so it's just the two of
us here again.

1:23:48.839 --> 1:23:51.183
Yeah.

1:24:09.389 --> 1:24:11.917
Turn off here.

1:24:11.919 --> 1:24:12.751
Here, why?

1:24:12.753 --> 1:24:14.193
I'm gonna show you something.

1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:17.723
What is this place?

1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:21.757
I have a friend
here, I wanna say goodbye.

1:24:21.759 --> 1:24:22.759
Come on.

1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:26.183
Really, a friend?

1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:29.778
Welcome, come in.

1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:31.919
Ooo, come in if you dare.

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:37.183
Such realistic costumes, fantastic.

1:24:38.150 --> 1:24:40.139
Boing boing.

1:24:40.141 --> 1:24:43.719
Oh.

1:24:47.741 --> 1:24:52.741
Vampires can't
stand the sunlight.

1:24:55.990 --> 1:24:57.693
Oh yeah, says you.

1:25:03.339 --> 1:25:04.339
Nelly!

1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:12.248
This is my friend,
Roberta, and this is papa.

1:25:12.250 --> 1:25:14.148
Ah, lennart.

1:25:14.150 --> 1:25:16.048
Really fantastic concept.

1:25:16.050 --> 1:25:20.108
So you're stitched together
from different body parts?

1:25:20.110 --> 1:25:21.713
I must say, it looks great.

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:27.093
It's lucky that it's just
a fake one, right?

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:29.960
Hotdog?

1:25:31.433 --> 1:25:32.878
Eh, no thanks, I'm fine.

1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:34.248
Come on.

1:25:34.250 --> 1:25:37.953
Scary teeth, really
scary, very realistic.

1:25:38.890 --> 1:25:41.548
Well I think I'm gonna
have to try something.

1:25:41.550 --> 1:25:44.868
Now, what's this, oh fingers with blood.

1:25:44.870 --> 1:25:46.720
Yeah, I'll have to have one of those.

1:25:49.630 --> 1:25:52.133
His hearing is bad, help yourself.

1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:57.163
You can have a whole hand, lennart.

1:25:58.270 --> 1:26:00.078
And I think I'll
also take a meringue.

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:01.580
Why not take two?

1:26:12.690 --> 1:26:16.353
Here, I thought that
you might wanna have this.

1:26:26.419 --> 1:26:28.408
You are my friend, Nelly,

1:26:28.410 --> 1:26:31.482
even though you're trying
to be a monster agent.

1:26:33.169 --> 1:26:35.419
I know your mom would
have been proud of you.

1:26:37.085 --> 1:26:38.085
And your mom too.
