00:46.480 --> 00:48.118
<i>The universe...</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:51.955
<i>a vast expanse
of space and matter.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:56.159
<i>It includes all that we see,
and all that we know.</i>

00:56.840 --> 00:58.751
<i>Since the beginning of time,</i>

00:58.840 --> 01:01.513
<i>we have wondered
how it came to be.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:04.239
<i>A gloriously
orchestrated plan?</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:06.834
<i>A chance series of events?</i>

01:07.040 --> 01:11.397
<i>Or something
much, much dumber?</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Aha!

01:35.160 --> 01:36.388
Eee!

05:26.240 --> 05:28.096
It's a beautiful day
out here on the ice...

05:28.120 --> 05:29.792
as father meets daughter

05:29.920 --> 05:31.751
in a quest for
hockey supremacy.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.114
It's Peaches meets Manny.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.429
Mammoth meets mammoth.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.675
<i>Mano a mano.</i>

05:35.760 --> 05:36.760
Meema me moo-ma.

05:36.800 --> 05:37.835
Mama may mee-mee.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.513
Will you two quit it?

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
M-okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.035
Meanie.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.076
The blazing mammoth
takes it on the breakaway.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.953
There's never been a player
so tough, so graceful.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.758
So desperate to score.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.115
He fakes right.
He fakes left.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.191
He fakes knowing
how to play.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.120
Huh?
What's wrong?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.838
Lose something?

05:58.040 --> 06:00.508
<i>Hey, what's that stink
I smell out there? It's Manny!</i>

06:00.680 --> 06:02.591
<i>Hey, hey. It's Manny!</i>

06:02.760 --> 06:03.795
<i>Whoo! You stink!</i>

06:03.960 --> 06:06.599
Okay, Fuzzball.
Let's see what you got.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.279
You asked for it.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.872
Yes! She dominates! Again.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.031
Oh, please.
I went easy on you.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.553
It's called good parenting.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.029
Yeah, right. Face it.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.553
I rule the ice now.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.870
Oh, you talk
a big game, hotshot.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.632
All right,
how about best of three?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.189
Whoo-hoo! Yes!
Touchdown!

06:33.360 --> 06:36.158
Wait, no, that's not right.
Not touchdown. What is it?

06:36.320 --> 06:38.629
Uh, hole-in-one!
Whoo!

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
Julian!
Whoa!

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
Ow!
Sorry.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.638
Honey, I scored!
Did you see me?

06:42.800 --> 06:46.156
Yeah! And you were amazing.
Whoa! Whoa!

06:46.640 --> 06:47.640
Careful!

06:47.840 --> 06:48.909
Oh, the ice
is really icy.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.072
It's like super-sized,
extra value icy.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.231
But I'm getting
better, right?

06:55.720 --> 06:56.720
Whoa!

06:59.000 --> 07:02.515
Okay, we'll play... later.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.035
So, she whupped
your butt again, huh?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.156
And with a butt
that size,

07:07.280 --> 07:08.918
that's a whole lot
of whuppin'.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.548
Nobody was whupped.
There was no whupping.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.948
It's just a loving father

07:13.040 --> 07:15.076
sharing some strategy
with his only daughter.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.708
Didn't know sucking
was a strategy.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.679
Okay, it's our turn.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.558
Let's show them
how it's done!

07:24.560 --> 07:25.913
You're going down, eh?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.671
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

07:30.280 --> 07:31.429
<i>Ta-ta-da-da!</i>

07:31.520 --> 07:33.875
For you, my mom-in-law-to-be.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.040
Buttercups!

07:35.200 --> 07:36.713
Nature's sunshine.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.314
Isn't sunshine
nature's sunshine?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.755
Aw! Thank you, Julian.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.758
It's been so long since
anyone's given me flowers.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.797
But you're marrying
our daughter.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.757
You don't have to
keep bringing us presents.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.399
But it makes me happy.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.872
And for you, my guru,
my rock, my main mammoth...

07:55.040 --> 07:58.112
To you, I give
the greatest gift of all.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.430
Wait. What are you doing?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.239
Come on, Bro-Dad.
Bring it in.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.513
Oh!

08:06.600 --> 08:08.397
I can feel your
heart beating.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.074
Okay. That's enough of that.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.039
You better get
used to it.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.553
They'll be living
right next door.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.273
Come on, Julian.
Wanna go?

08:16.440 --> 08:20.274
Actually, weren't you gonna
help me with the thing?

08:20.440 --> 08:22.908
Oh! Right. The thing.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.149
Gotta do the thing.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.594
I can do the thing.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.760
No!

08:27.600 --> 08:29.431
It's a girl thing.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.679
Hey! Why don't you
go do a guy thing?

08:32.840 --> 08:33.875
You know,
you don't spend

08:33.960 --> 08:35.176
nearly enough time
with your friends.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.270
I don't?
I'll see you later.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.591
On this special day.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.113
Uh... Okay.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.432
Have you told them
about our decision yet?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.989
No. I'm waiting
for the right time.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.276
Come on, Romeo.
Walk with me.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.576
I'm gonna watch
some butterflies

08:50.600 --> 08:51.640
come out of their cocoons.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.592
Whoa! Really?
No.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.319
Goodbye, sweetie.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.872
Aw! I remember when Manny
and I used to be like that.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.235
Not me! Love them
and leave them,

09:02.320 --> 09:03.673
and take half
of everything.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.114
That's my motto.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.195
Mi amor, so many ladies
have tried and failed...

09:12.400 --> 09:15.790
to strap a saddle
on Sid the stallion.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.994
But I want to share
everything with you.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.430
You're the wind
beneath my fleas,

09:22.520 --> 09:23.999
the algae of my eye.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.996
Will you be my mate for life?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.519
Sidney?
Mmm?

09:33.840 --> 09:35.159
Sidney, where are you?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.400
Francine.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
I need to ask...

09:42.440 --> 09:43.793
Ow!

09:44.040 --> 09:45.917
I need to
ask you something.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.040
Will you marry...

09:47.160 --> 09:48.560
Sid, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.914
I'm breaking up with you.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.389
What? But I planned
our whole future!

09:52.560 --> 09:54.073
Our wedding.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.280
Our kids.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.376
Mommy.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.594
Our burial plots.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
How you doing?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.199
I even hired a band.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.679
Hey!

10:01.760 --> 10:03.113
No, no. Not yet!

10:03.840 --> 10:06.195
Are you crazy?
We've only had one date.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.759
It lasted 14 minutes!

10:07.960 --> 10:10.428
Yes, but it felt like 20.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.635
Ugh!

10:11.720 --> 10:13.039
I can't! A ring?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.360
I mean,
I like the ring, but no.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.879
I can't. You're too clingy.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.508
How is this clingy?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.828
And by the way,

10:19.920 --> 10:22.115
you look nothing like
your profile picture.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.873
Francine,
you gotta start dating

10:23.960 --> 10:25.109
outside of your species.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.478
Franny, we can work this out.
Is this about the bikini? Ow!

10:30.880 --> 10:32.871
I didn't know
it was poison ivy.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.196
Oh! Uh-oh.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.748
Franny. Franny, help!

10:41.920 --> 10:43.319
Somebody.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.391
Is it the eyes that hurt...

10:45.560 --> 10:46.879
or my soul?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.115
Ow!

10:48.240 --> 10:50.231
Definitely the eyes.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.754
Ah, women!

10:57.920 --> 10:59.239
Yeah, women.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
What about them?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.752
I don't get 'em.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.119
Like, Ellie.
Life's great with her.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.999
There's no surprises.
Nothing ever changes.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.674
But then today,
she giggled.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.432
Does Shira ever
just giggle?

11:14.280 --> 11:16.032
Please don't eat me!

11:17.320 --> 11:19.356
Uh... Shira's not
a big giggler.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.078
Well, Ellie giggled.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.599
And then she wiggled.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.591
"Tee hee hee hee." Boom!

11:24.760 --> 11:26.159
Don't ever do that again.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.470
I have no idea why
she's acting so weird.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.039
Women.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.236
Women.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.160
Hello?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.511
And speaking of weird.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.677
Anybody there? Oh!

11:38.800 --> 11:41.030
Marco? Polo?

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
Oh, hi, Manny.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.633
Ew! Your breath is awful.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
What happened
to you?

11:47.880 --> 11:49.552
Oh, nothing.
Everything's great.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.029
Fabulous. Zippity-dippity.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.714
Okay, let me guess.
She dumped you.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.950
What is wrong with me?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.676
Everybody has somebody.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.479
And all I've got is
my boyish good looks

12:02.560 --> 12:04.312
and this mariachi band.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.393
Oh! So itchy!

12:11.800 --> 12:13.597
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
Ahh!

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
Whoa!

14:44.360 --> 14:46.828
All I wanted
is true love.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.468
Is that too much to ask?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.548
Why is it so quiet?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.280
Because the world
is mourning my loss.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.708
Ellie?

14:59.240 --> 15:00.309
Peaches?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.153
Where is everyone?

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
Surprise!

15:08.320 --> 15:10.311
Uh... Huh?

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
Ta-da!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.672
Happy Anniversary, honey!

15:16.840 --> 15:17.989
Anniversary?

15:18.520 --> 15:21.159
Oh, no. That's the thing.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.514
Okay! Now it's
your turn, Bro-Dad!

15:25.680 --> 15:27.398
Yeah! We wanna see
what you got Ellie.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.675
Manny!

15:28.840 --> 15:31.991
Manny! Manny! Manny!

15:32.240 --> 15:33.832
Manny!

15:34.040 --> 15:36.110
Hey, hey. Right.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.118
Uh...

15:38.200 --> 15:39.918
How about
another hand for Ellie?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.235
Yeah.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.680
Oh.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.394
He forgot!

15:46.360 --> 15:48.112
I feel so bad for Ellie.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.351
Ellie, I... Uh...

16:01.720 --> 16:04.792
Ooh! Ah!

16:04.880 --> 16:06.438
He didn't forget.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.955
That's how big
Manny's love is for her!

16:11.400 --> 16:13.755
Nice save
with the light show.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.912
Wait, you didn't do this?
Then who did?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.633
Oh, Manny.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.870
I was so afraid
you'd forgotten.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.389
But you lit up
the sky for me?

16:23.560 --> 16:24.913
How'd you do it?

16:25.280 --> 16:26.349
Uh, well...

16:26.440 --> 16:29.113
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.832
Oh...

16:30.920 --> 16:32.273
Thank you.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.796
I keep picturing
our own kid in there.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.439
He'd be the best one.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.755
I think you meant "she."

16:45.840 --> 16:46.909
He.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.590
Either way,
we've been over this, Diego.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.988
Kids are afraid of us.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.593
Yeah, but why?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.351
Are they gonna eat us?

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
Hi, kids!

17:02.840 --> 17:05.069
I even smiled this time.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.800
Wow, Dad.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.598
Best present ever.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.270
You, sir, are an education
in marital excellence.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.874
I'm really gonna miss
you guys when we leave.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.280
Ow!

17:24.920 --> 17:27.832
Um, actually,
I haven't told them yet.

17:28.319 --> 17:29.469
Oh.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.959
Surprise!

17:31.120 --> 17:32.120
You're leaving?

17:32.160 --> 17:33.656
I thought you guys
were gonna live with us

17:33.680 --> 17:34.720
the first couple of years.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.836
I know. But Julian and I

17:36.920 --> 17:38.273
kind of want to
roam for a while.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.509
- Roam?
- Yeah!

17:39.680 --> 17:42.672
Travel, explore,
just go wherever.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.798
No plan is the best plan.
That's my philosophy.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Hors d'oeuvres?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.556
That's not a plan,
or a philosophy...

17:49.720 --> 17:50.948
or very safe.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.873
Dad, we're young.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.474
We can worry about being safe
when we're old and boring.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
Like you and Mom.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.717
I think we should just...
Excuse me!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.359
This is a family discussion.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.431
But aren't I
part of your family?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.073
Not yet, you're not.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.269
Uh...

18:10.400 --> 18:12.470
Does that look like
a problem to you?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.715
A ball of fire heading
directly towards us?

18:17.880 --> 18:19.199
Why would that
be a problem?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.976
What if you fall in a ditch
and get amnesia?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.194
What then, huh?

18:22.360 --> 18:23.395
Manny, we have a problem.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.118
Not now.
I have a problem.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.360
This one's a little bigger.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.953
I don't think so.
Manny!

18:28.120 --> 18:29.269
What?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
Manny?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.154
Uh, okay.
Party's over, everybody.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.390
Have a good night.
And leave right now!

18:39.560 --> 18:41.790
What are you talking about?
The party just got started.

18:41.960 --> 18:42.960
Yeah.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.230
Just getting
kind of sleepy.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.312
Everyone should go.
And duck. Possibly cover!

18:48.520 --> 18:50.431
Hey, what's gotten into you?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.793
Look! There's more coming!

19:02.800 --> 19:04.472
Meteor shower!

19:05.240 --> 19:06.434
Meteor?

19:06.560 --> 19:07.560
Shower?

19:10.160 --> 19:12.435
Manny's love
is killing us!

19:12.600 --> 19:15.398
I suppose this is all part
of your magic show for me?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.198
Abracadabra?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.793
Can you guys
deal with this later?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.598
Come on.
We need to take cover.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.955
Whoo-hoo! I'm on fire!

19:27.240 --> 19:30.789
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Me too!
We're smoking hot, baby!

19:33.320 --> 19:34.514
Incoming!

19:34.680 --> 19:35.954
Those are ours!

19:37.000 --> 19:38.831
Are you okay?
How many tusks do you see?

19:38.920 --> 19:39.920
Tree.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Three?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.911
No! Tree!

19:51.120 --> 19:52.997
Everybody, jump!

20:01.520 --> 20:03.112
Whee!

20:03.720 --> 20:05.631
The cave! Get inside!

20:05.800 --> 20:07.074
Move! Move!

20:09.560 --> 20:11.152
Whoa!
Whoa!

20:18.760 --> 20:19.795
Oh!

20:19.880 --> 20:21.711
It's okay, sweetheart.
Daddy's...

20:32.840 --> 20:34.592
Hey, it sounds like
it's slowing down.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.190
Yup, it's definitely over.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.236
Except for that one.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.034
We might wanna think

20:48.120 --> 20:50.395
about moving underground
for a while.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.991
Look at that!
I got an egg.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.880
How many eggs did you poach,
little brother?

21:15.040 --> 21:16.656
Do we have to steal
other creatures' eggs?

21:16.680 --> 21:18.238
I mean, couldn't we
just go vegan?

21:18.400 --> 21:19.958
Sure, we could eat vegans.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.076
Whoops! Oh-oh-oh!

21:22.160 --> 21:24.071
Son, sometimes I wonder

21:24.160 --> 21:25.991
how you snuck into
this family.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.360
<i>Figaro, Figaro</i>

21:27.440 --> 21:31.149
<i>Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</i>

21:31.320 --> 21:34.551
With you in a minute.
I'll have to rinse and repeat.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.274
That weasel
is such a buzzkill.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.833
Let's go, kids.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.228
Don't worry, ma'am.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.078
I'll catch the crew
that poached your egg.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.358
It's a pun!

21:45.440 --> 21:46.998
I'm winking
under the eye patch.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.877
<b>A mother is crying
A damsel in distress</b>

21:52.320 --> 21:55.676
<i>Foreboding intruders
Have made such a mess</i>

21:55.840 --> 21:57.512
<i>What I detect
is a lack of respect</i>

21:57.600 --> 21:58.999
<i>For all that is precious
and dear</i>

21:59.480 --> 22:02.552
<i>I am the pint-sized protector
Of this lost world</i>

22:03.200 --> 22:05.156
But my friends call me Buck.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.319
Well played, guys.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.592
<i>I have a message,
bullies not welcome</i>

22:11.680 --> 22:12.829
<i>Return what you've stolen</i>

22:13.000 --> 22:14.433
<i>Go back where
you came from</i>

22:16.640 --> 22:18.136
<i>You know I'm greater,
so don't be a hater</i>

22:18.160 --> 22:19.878
<i>You may be Jurassic,
but I am fantastic</i>

22:20.040 --> 22:24.511
<i>Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</i>

22:24.680 --> 22:27.831
<i>Figaro</i>

22:28.360 --> 22:30.191
Oh, love that bit.

22:30.360 --> 22:31.776
<i>Running and climbing
And spinning and grinning</i>

22:31.800 --> 22:32.896
<i>And dashing
and diving and dodging</i>

22:32.920 --> 22:34.336
<i>And sliding and gliding
and staying alive</i>

22:34.360 --> 22:35.416
<i>And these are
a few of the things</i>

22:35.440 --> 22:36.440
<i>That I do before lunch</i>

22:36.520 --> 22:38.670
<i>Death defying
Danger denying</i>

22:38.840 --> 22:40.114
<i>Look, I'm flying</i>

22:40.280 --> 22:42.510
<i>You might think I'm mad
But, hey, you only live once</i>

22:42.680 --> 22:44.591
<i>No need to thank me</i>

22:44.680 --> 22:46.671
<i>But if you insist,
I won't resist</i>

22:46.880 --> 22:48.916
<i>Who smells like fish?</i>

22:49.080 --> 22:51.036
Huh?
Hold on to your butts!

22:51.200 --> 22:52.200
<i>Class</i>

22:59.600 --> 23:02.876
<i>Dismissed</i>

23:05.880 --> 23:07.074
Good egg.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.199
Here you are, my lady.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.715
Huh?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.870
Go! I'll lead them away.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.273
Oh, that was fun!

23:29.360 --> 23:31.430
Same time, same place,
next week?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.670
Toodles!

23:34.160 --> 23:36.469
Congratulations, weasel.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.478
You just signed
your death warrant.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.635
Weaseled my way out
of that one.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.713
Hmm. What's all that
flash and dazzle about?

23:46.800 --> 23:47.835
Oh!

23:47.920 --> 23:50.388
Who puts a rock in the
middle of the jungle?

23:50.480 --> 23:51.674
Ow!

24:00.800 --> 24:01.800
Mmm.

24:04.960 --> 24:05.960
Ooh.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.200
Ha!

24:23.320 --> 24:24.673
Blimey!

24:25.600 --> 24:27.192
What is this place?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
Whoops!

24:50.360 --> 24:51.759
Hmm.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.880
Uh...

25:42.640 --> 25:43.868
Hello?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.879
Yeah!

26:02.240 --> 26:04.037
Oh! Hello, mammals.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.320
Hi, Buck!

26:05.640 --> 26:07.198
Hi.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
Bye, Buck!

26:09.280 --> 26:10.429
Um, a little help.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.231
Right on the spleen!

26:19.400 --> 26:21.595
Utterly useless,
but totally hurts.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.194
Hey, Buck.
Welcome back, buddy.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.193
Wait. This half-a-snack
is the dinosaur whisperer?

26:27.360 --> 26:29.635
And expert salsa dancer.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.835
Whoo!

26:33.920 --> 26:36.036
I have one eye
but all my original teeth.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.196
Would you like to
count them? Ah...

26:38.280 --> 26:39.599
No, thank you.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.512
And this must be Nectarine.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.114
Um... Peaches.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.315
Semantics, my dear.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.799
I am deeply honored.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.557
Sweet eye patch.
Very gangsta.

26:51.720 --> 26:52.755
Thank you.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.916
- I like this kid.
- Buck.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.078
Whoa!
What are you doing here?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.639
Well, I... What?

26:59.360 --> 27:00.475
I'm trying!

27:00.680 --> 27:03.069
But how do you tell
someone they're doomed?

27:03.800 --> 27:05.677
He's stumped.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.795
We're not doomed, Buck.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.520
It was just a meteor shower,
and the show's over.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.600
Ahh!

27:10.680 --> 27:11.960
Oh, quite the contrary,
old chap.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.190
It's just beginning.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.392
You see, I found a prophecy.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.589
Do you mind?

27:25.320 --> 27:28.392
Boy, he really sucks the fun
out of everything. Doesn't he?

27:28.560 --> 27:29.675
Fun sucker!

27:30.080 --> 27:32.116
I read this tablet
front to back.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.873
And the story it tells
is very disturbing.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.315
Every hundred million
years or so,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.550
the world gets
a cosmic cleansing.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.079
Before the dinosaurs,

27:41.160 --> 27:44.118
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.434
Ugh! Yuck.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.437
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

27:47.560 --> 27:48.834
an asteroid hit.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.150
Boom! Bye-bye.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.437
Next, dinosaurs,
mountain range, asteroid.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.953
Boom! Bye-bye.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.395
And coming up next, mammals.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.471
Mountain range,
asteroid, boom!

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
Bye-bye.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.913
Stupid mammals.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.274
That's us.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.755
Mmm.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.636
Yep, and there she is.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.634
The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.308
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.835
Hey, that wasn't
there before.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.911
And look what
it's doing to the sky.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.310
No worries.
Because I've got a plan.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.040
Really? To stop
an asteroid?

28:29.600 --> 28:31.636
Look, the last two asteroids

28:31.720 --> 28:33.711
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.791
And it's about to
happen again.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.473
We've got to go there

28:37.560 --> 28:39.312
and see what's attracting
the asteroid.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.318
Once we know
why it's coming...

28:41.480 --> 28:43.710
we can figure out how to
send it somewhere else.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.393
That plan is so dumb,

28:45.480 --> 28:47.755
I wish it had a face
so I could smack it.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.955
Let me get this straight.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.594
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

28:51.760 --> 28:53.955
you want us to run
directly towards it?

28:54.120 --> 28:57.078
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

28:57.240 --> 28:59.435
it'll kill us
no matter where we went.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.238
Well, that's reassuring.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.709
Okay, but even if
we get to the crash site...

29:03.880 --> 29:05.313
how are we supposed to change

29:05.400 --> 29:07.834
what is literally
written in stone?

29:08.200 --> 29:10.077
Ah, my cynical friend.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.276
The dinos were wiped off
the face of the Earth,

29:12.360 --> 29:14.078
but some escaped.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.073
They changed their fate
and we can change ours, too.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.071
Who's with me?

29:22.520 --> 29:24.431
So, what do you think?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.716
Honestly, I'm worried
the weasel's right.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.040
No!
Don't listen to the weasel.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.554
He's a raving loon!

29:32.760 --> 29:35.354
Sorry. I just love
playing devil's advocate.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.829
And looking fabulous!

29:39.560 --> 29:42.074
Well, Buck has saved
our lives before, right?

29:42.240 --> 29:44.117
But what if
he can't this time?

29:44.280 --> 29:45.838
I don't know
what to believe.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.514
But I'm afraid
our lives will be over

29:48.640 --> 29:49.868
before they begin.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.469
Okay.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.551
I guess we're in.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.196
Crash and Eddie
reporting for duty.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.833
Doody.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.679
Excellent!
And dirty word processed.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.856
Now, we better
get on the road

30:06.880 --> 30:08.950
because time till
impact is roughly...

30:09.080 --> 30:12.231
2 days, 4 hours,
1 minute and 16 seconds.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.197
15 seconds, 14 seconds...

30:14.720 --> 30:15.789
I think we get it.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.713
I think we're
all gonna get it.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.556
Whoo! We look so cool.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
Whoa!

30:34.880 --> 30:36.950
Ugh. What is this stuff?

30:57.520 --> 31:00.273
Where is he? When I am through
with that one-eyed weasel...

31:00.440 --> 31:02.396
he's going to need
two eye patches.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.509
I admire your
bloodthirstitude, Gertie.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.749
But you heard them.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.831
An asteroid is coming.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.758
This changes things.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.710
Holy snowballs!
It's freezing up here.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.075
Parts are retracting
into other parts.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.674
Would you please stop
acting like a parakeet?

31:23.240 --> 31:25.515
It's a good thing you got
your mother's eyes...

31:25.680 --> 31:27.398
or you'd be
totally useless.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.232
Well, that's just
hurtful.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.108
What do you see?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.719
Nothing. Nothing.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.550
Deadly asteroid
screaming towards Earth.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.118
Wait! There he is.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.238
That's too bad.
He is really far away.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.118
Probably too far
to reach by flight.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.428
Oh, well.
Let's just go home.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.792
We are not retreating!

31:51.960 --> 31:53.678
Until that weasel
came along...

31:53.840 --> 31:55.910
our family made
an honest living

31:56.000 --> 31:57.194
stealing dino eggs.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.669
An honest living. Stealing.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.113
Kind of ironic,
don't you think?

32:01.560 --> 32:03.790
Besides,
why take out the weasel

32:03.880 --> 32:05.711
if the asteroid is
just gonna take us out?

32:05.880 --> 32:08.394
So much sight.
So little vision.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.869
If we stop the weasel
and his friends

32:10.960 --> 32:12.632
from diverting
the asteroid...

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
Kablooie!

32:13.880 --> 32:16.440
It kills the weasel
and everyone else...

32:16.600 --> 32:20.434
while we glide
safely above it all.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.273
It'll be our paradise.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.989
That's seems
highly implausible.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.879
Just from
a scientific standpoint.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.640
Fine. It's a great plan.
Dynamite!

32:32.840 --> 32:33.920
One of the top
three or four

32:34.000 --> 32:35.752
species annihilation plans
I've ever heard.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.194
That's better.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.069
Now let's make sure
that asteroid hits.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.312
Why can't we just
fear the apocalypse

32:43.440 --> 32:44.668
like a normal family?

33:09.160 --> 33:10.160
Whoa!

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400
Mmm.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.640
Mmm?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.634
What are you doing, Buck?

34:26.800 --> 34:28.630
All rocks tell a tale.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.398
Where we've been
and where we're heading.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.237
Ah!

34:36.320 --> 34:38.788
That, however,
is a turd.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.955
Julian...

34:44.120 --> 34:47.237
I want you to know
that if we don't make it...

34:47.400 --> 34:49.550
if we never get married...

34:49.719 --> 34:51.233
you were the
only one for me.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.476
Hey, come on!

34:53.639 --> 34:56.359
Of course we'll make it,
and we will get married.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.909
But maybe it's the universe
telling us we won't.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.348
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

35:00.440 --> 35:02.795
You're going to let
one tiny little...

35:02.960 --> 35:05.952
300-mile-wide asteroid
ruin your plans?

35:06.160 --> 35:07.440
How can we think
about our future

35:07.480 --> 35:08.799
when we may not have one?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.479
Hey, we're going to
stop this thing

35:10.560 --> 35:11.675
and you'll get married.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.677
Bada-bing, bada-boom!

35:13.880 --> 35:16.155
Well, not boom.
Forget I said boom.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.995
I know!
I'll be your wedding planner!

35:20.160 --> 35:21.434
It'll take your mind

35:21.520 --> 35:23.272
off all this
end-of-the-world stuff.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.829
Actually, we were
just gonna wing it!

35:25.920 --> 35:26.960
Keep it low-key.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.513
What?

35:28.680 --> 35:30.318
Peaches, Peaches.
Sweetheart,

35:30.440 --> 35:33.193
you don't just wing the
happiest day of your life!

35:33.400 --> 35:36.358
No, you seize it
and you cherish it.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.875
You strangle it
with good intentions.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.996
Ooh. Let's start
with your hair.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.673
Updo with a top bun?
Traditional.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.799
Or updo with a fishtail braid.
Flirtatious.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.110
But maybe a little trashy.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.353
Ugh.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.919
And garter belts!

35:57.440 --> 36:00.079
Today, Ed is modelling
laced daisies.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.595
While Crash is rocking
a more elegant ivy...

36:02.800 --> 36:04.552
that's all about the calves.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.472
Ooh. We need
a seating chart!

36:06.680 --> 36:08.989
The singles table,
the kids table,

36:09.080 --> 36:10.399
the weird relatives table...

36:10.600 --> 36:13.433
the smelly table,
two more smelly tables.

36:13.760 --> 36:14.954
Look at him.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.599
Oh,
you're gonna love it.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.159
Who walks like that?

36:18.480 --> 36:20.311
Oh! Look at me.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.595
I'm Julian.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.113
Forget the asteroid.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.436
Gimme a hug, Bro-Dad!

36:25.600 --> 36:27.909
Look at
that pretty bird there.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.036
Yeah! That is a pretty bird.
Good eye, Manny.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.633
Yeah.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.034
The sky is
literally falling...

36:36.200 --> 36:37.474
and she thinks
we're just gonna

36:37.600 --> 36:39.040
let her stroll
into the wilderness...

36:39.160 --> 36:40.991
with Mr. No Plans
Bouncy Walk.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.593
Stop picking on him.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.473
Come on, El, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.033
No. I'm not still mad.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.713
Because that's not
how I want to spend

36:48.800 --> 36:50.358
what could be our
final days together.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.073
But if we somehow survive

36:52.160 --> 36:53.991
that planet-killing
hunk of space rock...

36:54.160 --> 36:55.160
you're in for it.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.515
If we survive,
we lose our daughter.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.557
Well, I've been thinking
about that, too.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.119
What if...

37:01.320 --> 37:03.629
Ooh. I know! We destroy
the relationship, right?

37:03.800 --> 37:05.392
That way we never
have to let her go...

37:05.560 --> 37:08.313
and she'll just stay
our little girl forever!

37:10.160 --> 37:11.991
No, you psychopath!

37:12.160 --> 37:15.630
What if we convince them
to stay near us?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.791
Oh! That's better.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.911
I like it. But how?

37:20.080 --> 37:22.071
The way we always
get her to do what we want.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.470
We make her think
it's her idea.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.992
You sneaky, sneaky minx!

37:28.080 --> 37:30.389
Let's just hope
we haven't lost our touch.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.715
Found it!

37:32.840 --> 37:34.353
Behold, mammals!

37:34.560 --> 37:37.518
A sneak preview
of the asteroid to come.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.150
A space rock.
Fresh from the cosmos.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.079
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.355
I taste iron, carbon.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.835
Oh! And a hint of nickel.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.832
Space tastes lonely.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.837
Hey, look!
I found another one.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.040
Me, too!

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
Hmm...

38:02.360 --> 38:03.873
Hey! Yours is
attracted to me.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.508
No. Yours is
attracted to me.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.189
We're just too attractive!

38:12.360 --> 38:14.271
Stupendous!
Now we have something

38:14.360 --> 38:16.191
to play with
during our final hours.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.039
You're missing
the point, Tiger.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.553
They're magnets.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.590
And if these space rocks
are magnetic...

38:22.760 --> 38:23.875
so is that.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.551
This can only
mean one thing.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.597
And that would be...

38:31.480 --> 38:32.595
Allow me.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.233
Whoa!

38:36.320 --> 38:37.548
Where are we?

38:37.720 --> 38:39.756
You are
in my brain.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.229
Hmm. Kind of chilly.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.789
Gentlemen,
here's what we know.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.748
Space rocks? Magnetic.
Asteroid? Also, magnetic.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.316
Famed astrophysicist
Neil deBuck Weasel!

38:52.480 --> 38:53.799
He knows the cosmos.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.269
Ipso facto,
thusly and ergo...

38:56.440 --> 38:58.396
the crash site must have
a heap of these things

38:58.520 --> 39:00.112
attracting the asteroid.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.908
Ooh. Pythagoras Buck.
He's got the right angle.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.399
What if we use
the magnets

39:04.480 --> 39:06.040
to attract the asteroids
somewhere else?

39:06.080 --> 39:07.752
As in, not towards Earth.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.558
Theoretically speaking,

39:09.640 --> 39:11.949
if we can launch enough
of these into space...

39:12.160 --> 39:14.515
they will pull
the asteroid off course.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.431
Thus, saving the world.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.271
So, we just need to
go to the crash site...

39:22.440 --> 39:24.749
and launch a bunch of
rocks into space.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.096
That's easy, right?

39:26.120 --> 39:28.793
Oh, yeah. Sounds like
a real piece of cake.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.439
This is progress!

39:30.600 --> 39:32.875
Now we know exactly what
we don't know how to do.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.673
<i>Vamanos,</i> mammals!

39:35.840 --> 39:38.559
This trail will take us
directly to the crash site.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.679
All right, kids.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.552
Let's have some fun.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.551
Oh!

39:47.960 --> 39:49.951
Okay, everyone.
Follow the trail.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.190
Never leave the trail.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.311
Hmm?

40:00.240 --> 40:02.196
Okay, everyone.
Leave the trail.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.793
Into the forest.
Chop, chop.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.991
But you just said...

40:06.080 --> 40:08.640
You know I'm crazy. Come on.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.549
I love the shade.
Don't you?

40:24.320 --> 40:25.833
Well played, weasel.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.149
Stay sharp, kids.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.351
They can't hide forever.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
Hey, Buck.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.914
You have a suggestion
for getting around the river?

40:45.080 --> 40:48.231
Let's see if the tablet's
ancient wisdom will guide us.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.560
Hmm.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.560
Hmm.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.028
Let my mammals pass!

41:16.240 --> 41:17.798
That's never gonna work.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.798
The ancients
grant us safe passage.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.156
Sweet!

41:55.280 --> 41:57.669
Wow, the air
feels strange.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.513
Uh...

41:59.600 --> 42:00.749
Diego?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.120
Hmm...

42:05.960 --> 42:06.960
What?

42:21.280 --> 42:24.431
Finally! We have
superpowers!

42:27.960 --> 42:29.109
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:29.200 --> 42:32.033
we have wandered
into an electrical storm.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.788
I suggest we all
stay away from the trees.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.549
Sure, no problem.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.993
It's not like
we're in a forest.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.677
Boy, Mother Nature sure
is in a bad mood lately.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.308
Good thing we're all here
to help each other.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.836
Oh, like I always say,
stay close, stay alive.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.355
There they are!

43:01.480 --> 43:03.994
Right out in the open.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.718
How stupid can you be?

43:05.880 --> 43:08.030
Come on, kids. Dive!

43:14.440 --> 43:18.228
Everyone, try not to create
any sort of friction.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.231
No friction. Got it.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.197
Yup. Cool beans.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.998
Friction is what now?

43:25.280 --> 43:26.679
Oh, no.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.237
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

43:45.600 --> 43:46.828
Hurry, Granny.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.035
Don't you hurry me.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.555
I've been struck by
lightning more times...

43:50.800 --> 43:52.119
Ahh! Granny!

43:52.560 --> 43:54.596
...than you've had
hot breakfasts.

43:59.760 --> 44:00.760
Peaches!

44:02.960 --> 44:05.110
Julian, don't move!

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
Oh!

44:07.800 --> 44:09.153
I have an idea.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.878
I'm coming, sweetheart!

44:12.560 --> 44:14.278
Julian, why aren't you
helping her?

44:14.400 --> 44:16.356
Wait! No, Manny, she...

44:20.760 --> 44:22.239
Uh, what are you guys doing?

44:22.400 --> 44:23.435
Helping?

44:23.600 --> 44:25.238
What would "not helping"
look like?

44:26.760 --> 44:28.193
Hey, zapheads!

44:28.280 --> 44:29.280
Whoo!

44:35.600 --> 44:37.636
Manny, get ready to run.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.112
Come on, let's go!

44:52.960 --> 44:54.109
Everybody make it?

44:54.280 --> 44:56.191
Shira, Manny, Crash,
Eddie, Ellie, Granny.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.191
Aw, shoot!
I'm out of fingers.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.032
Buck. Where's Buck?

45:02.800 --> 45:03.869
Do you hear that?

45:05.440 --> 45:06.475
A baby!

45:06.800 --> 45:08.631
There's a baby in there!

45:09.000 --> 45:11.275
Buck, wait!
It's too dangerous.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.634
He's gone.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.313
I can't believe it.

45:20.480 --> 45:23.313
Don't know how we'll
go on without you, Buck.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.792
All right, let's go.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.469
It's Buck!

45:34.080 --> 45:35.479
Huh?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.798
I got you.
Don't worry, I got you.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.150
There you are. There.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.469
Say "hi," everyone.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.675
Huh?

45:44.360 --> 45:46.157
Isn't she gorgeous?

45:46.360 --> 45:48.157
How can he tell
it's a she?

45:49.200 --> 45:50.235
Oh.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.675
Such a good
little poochie-woochie.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.194
Just to be clear,
that's a pumpkin, right?

45:57.880 --> 46:00.997
She has a little jaundice,
but I think she'll be okay.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.912
Yes, you will.

46:03.080 --> 46:06.834
I think I'll call you...
Bronwyn.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.555
Um, little buddy?
We need you back on planet Earth.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.915
While it's still here. Okay?

46:12.120 --> 46:13.269
Right you are, mammal.

46:13.440 --> 46:17.035
Who wants to save the world
from the fiery asteroid?

46:17.120 --> 46:18.120
You do!

46:19.880 --> 46:20.880
Hmm.

46:36.560 --> 46:37.560
Mmm...

46:37.640 --> 46:39.631
Okay, mammals.
Let's stop here for the night.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.711
Stop? What about the whole

46:41.800 --> 46:43.392
end of the world
collision thing?

46:43.560 --> 46:45.471
Oh, asteroid's
still a day off.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.074
And like my grandfather
used to say...

46:48.280 --> 46:51.033
"Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.312
"Purple sky at night,
who moved my foot cream?

46:54.480 --> 46:56.391
"I need my foot cream."

46:56.560 --> 46:59.154
Grampy was a confused
and angry weasel.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.229
You are so funny, J.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.633
Stop! You're funny.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.274
Take it easy, my brother
from a tiger mother.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.671
<i>Hasta manana,</i> J-man.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.639
What was that?

47:13.800 --> 47:14.994
What was what?

47:16.960 --> 47:18.791
Oh, that! It's a cool way
to peace out.

47:18.920 --> 47:19.989
Julian taught it to me.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.469
Well, I'm glad the apocalypse
is bringing you together.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.074
He's a good kid, Manny.
I like his philosophy.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.071
Give him a chance.
Bond with him.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.398
<i>So light 'em up, up, up</i>

47:29.480 --> 47:30.754
<i>Light 'em up, up, up</i>

47:30.920 --> 47:34.833
<i>Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire</i>

47:35.280 --> 47:37.919
Bonding!
That's a good idea!

47:38.320 --> 47:40.595
Oh, right. Got you.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.797
You take Julian.
I got an idea for Peaches.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.956
Hey, Bro-Kid.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.395
Oh, hey, Bro-Dad.
You here to rock out?

47:53.160 --> 47:54.673
Okay. Instead of that...

47:55.440 --> 47:57.271
how about a game
before bedtime?

47:57.440 --> 48:00.989
No way! You want to play
a game with me? Wow!

48:01.160 --> 48:03.879
What is honored times 1,000?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.553
No! Times one million?

48:05.720 --> 48:09.315
'Cause whatever that equals,
is how honored I am.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.550
So, is that a "yes"?

48:11.720 --> 48:14.314
Yes, that's a "yes."
It's the most "yes"!

48:14.480 --> 48:16.311
It's like "yes"
with a bunch of s's...

48:16.480 --> 48:19.677
so it's like
"yessssssssssssssssssss."

48:19.840 --> 48:21.068
Great!

48:21.240 --> 48:23.310
I'll see you on the ice!

48:27.160 --> 48:28.195
Happy?

48:30.080 --> 48:31.195
Whoa!

48:36.320 --> 48:37.594
Oh, boy.

48:45.520 --> 48:48.159
So, do you think you're ready
to go out roaming on your own?

48:48.360 --> 48:50.510
I won't be alone.
I'll have Julian.

48:50.680 --> 48:53.240
Sure. But with
asteroids flying...

48:53.400 --> 48:54.719
no home to speak of

48:54.840 --> 48:56.751
and absolutely
no support system...

48:56.920 --> 48:58.399
do you think
you'll be ready for...

48:58.520 --> 48:59.520
this?

49:01.040 --> 49:03.031
I'm a wittle baby.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.755
Imagine. You're in the woods,
looking for food...

49:06.960 --> 49:09.269
and your baby gets sick.
What do you do?

49:09.360 --> 49:10.509
Uh...

49:10.600 --> 49:12.750
No! Jiggling makes
her feel worse!

49:17.520 --> 49:19.317
Oh, no! Now your
older toddler

49:19.400 --> 49:21.868
has a skinned knee
and a stuffy nose.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.708
Mommy, hold me!

49:23.880 --> 49:25.199
Now your babies are crying.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.271
You have no food and then

49:27.400 --> 49:30.073
you come face to face
with a rabid beast!

49:31.920 --> 49:36.391
I am a rabid beast who
gives rabies to babies.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.270
And there's an arsonist
on the loose.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.755
How are you going to handle
all this without our help?

49:58.920 --> 50:00.831
Huh?
Ah!

50:05.760 --> 50:06.875
Ah!

50:08.760 --> 50:10.113
Peaches, out!

50:14.800 --> 50:16.199
That's just the easy stuff.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.669
There's a lot more
we still need to cover.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.515
Uh... Baby made a poopie.

50:22.760 --> 50:27.470
I'm a method actor,
so I will need to be changed.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.118
Oh! So close!

50:30.280 --> 50:32.316
These pucks go fast.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.358
Just watch the puck
all the way into the stick.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.712
Oh! I did it!

50:40.880 --> 50:42.950
Too bad you and Peaches
are moving away.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.315
If you stayed,
we could do this all the time.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.954
Okay. Show me the heat!

50:48.120 --> 50:49.951
I'm like a hockey ninja!

50:53.200 --> 50:54.553
Hey, Peaches!

50:54.720 --> 50:56.517
Looks like you got
a new hockey partner

50:56.640 --> 50:58.039
to replace your dad.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.469
Oh!

51:04.560 --> 51:05.879
Oh, no.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.559
Julian!

51:14.480 --> 51:16.835
Such a mystery why he
wants to move far away.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.353
I didn't mean to do it.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.670
It's not my fault
the kid has no reflexes.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.176
How could you
do that to him?

51:22.200 --> 51:23.474
I thought you liked Julian.

51:23.680 --> 51:24.680
I do like Julian.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.989
Well, you don't act like it.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.594
When you look at him,
all you see is an obstacle.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.318
Or worse, a target.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.317
But I see a sweet guy...

51:32.520 --> 51:35.432
who's trying his hardest
to impress you.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.670
Peaches.
No! Both of you, just stop!

51:37.840 --> 51:39.671
If we survive,
I'm still getting married

51:39.760 --> 51:40.988
and I'm still leaving home.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.555
Whether you're happy
for me or not.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.716
Don't give me that look.
She said both.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.711
That means you, too.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.837
And this widdle astewoid

51:54.920 --> 51:57.070
went wee, wee, wee,
all the way home.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.033
Hey...

52:01.120 --> 52:02.155
Eh...

52:02.240 --> 52:05.949
Because Daddy and his
fwiends saved the world.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.789
<i>And if
that pterodactyl don't fly</i>

52:19.960 --> 52:23.316
<i>Daddy's gonna blind
his remaining eye</i>

52:28.400 --> 52:30.391
Sweet dreams, little one.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.709
Lucky pumpkin!

52:33.800 --> 52:35.995
It must be nice to
have a loving father.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.115
Whoo.

52:37.240 --> 52:40.073
Okay, here we go.
You can do this, Roger.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.278
Yay! Kidnapping!

52:44.920 --> 52:46.831
Look I'm sorry. It's not me.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.216
I would never do
something like this.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.595
It's my father. He's crazy.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.830
I can't believe
he pulled it off!

52:53.000 --> 52:54.638
Way to go, dum-dum!

52:54.800 --> 52:56.119
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.510
Whatever! I could've
done the same thing.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.759
Well, well.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.559
Looks like you're not
stopping that asteroid now,

53:05.640 --> 53:06.834
are you, weasel?

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
Huh?

53:08.840 --> 53:10.080
That's not the weasel.
That's...

53:11.040 --> 53:13.110
I don't know what that is.
Hmm.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.480
Whoa!

53:16.760 --> 53:18.478
Is it my time, angel?

53:19.000 --> 53:20.274
Time for what?

53:20.840 --> 53:22.478
I'm coming to the light.

53:22.880 --> 53:25.952
Can't wait to see all those
dead relatives I hate.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.116
Ahh! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

53:28.480 --> 53:29.879
Go help your sister.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.109
But, Dad...

53:31.640 --> 53:33.119
Ahh! Demon angel!

53:35.640 --> 53:38.200
Mess with Granny,
get knocked on your fanny.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.630
And that's how
it's done. Hmm.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.154
Hello? Angel?

53:48.320 --> 53:49.469
Am I in heaven?

53:49.640 --> 53:51.710
It's so dark
and squishy in here.

53:51.800 --> 53:52.835
Huh?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.594
Oh, no! I can still
see the light.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.080
Ow!

54:02.400 --> 54:04.356
Pop! I'll save you.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.316
Whee!

54:10.760 --> 54:11.760
Hello!

54:16.840 --> 54:18.717
Oh, well.
Probably for the best.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.233
Yeah, probably.
Definitely.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.560
Crikey!

54:35.200 --> 54:37.031
Mmm.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.953
Good gravy, Buck.
What have you done?

54:40.120 --> 54:42.111
All right, mammals.
Time to get moving.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.555
Now let's not linger
on this, but, yes...

54:44.760 --> 54:47.957
I read the tablet wrong.
The asteroid is a lot closer.

54:51.800 --> 54:52.800
Uh-oh.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.632
Wait a second.
Where's Granny?

54:54.920 --> 54:57.753
Oh.
Granny? Oh, Granny?

54:57.920 --> 54:59.239
Maybe she wandered off?

54:59.440 --> 55:01.192
Maybe she got hit in
the head with a puck?

55:01.400 --> 55:02.879
Yes! And maybe
she was abducted

55:02.960 --> 55:04.632
by homicidal
30-foot dino-birds...

55:04.800 --> 55:06.233
seeking revenge on me.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.392
All good theories.
I'm going to go with the puck.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.959
I knew it!

55:12.240 --> 55:15.232
So this whole time we've been
chased by giant dino-birds?

55:15.560 --> 55:18.552
Oh, only three!
I didn't want to damage morale.

55:18.720 --> 55:19.835
Right. Because before this,

55:19.960 --> 55:21.791
we were on a carefree
pleasure cruise.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.479
Wait a second.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.915
I've got her scent. Come on!

55:35.080 --> 55:36.080
Whoa!

55:38.080 --> 55:40.799
Mammals, we've made it!

55:40.960 --> 55:42.518
The crash site.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.114
This must be what's left
of the previous asteroid.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.917
Uh, Buck?
Your space rocks!

55:50.960 --> 55:52.791
We could definitely
divert the asteroid

55:52.920 --> 55:54.148
with a magnet that size!

55:54.320 --> 55:55.912
I mean that thing
is enormous.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.314
It's massive, it's...

55:57.480 --> 55:59.755
...going to be impossible
to get off the ground.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.313
It's entirely possible.

56:01.480 --> 56:04.153
In a way that we don't
know about yet.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.958
But what about
the dino-birds?

56:06.120 --> 56:07.951
And what about Granny?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.599
Nothing.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.714
I'm sorry, Sid.

56:13.840 --> 56:18.311
Oh, Granny.
My sweet, malicious Granny.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.956
Why does it always have to be
the old ones who go first?

56:22.120 --> 56:23.189
Why?

56:25.800 --> 56:28.712
I can still hear her
sweet, shrill voice...

56:28.880 --> 56:30.996
shrieking from
the afterlife.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.029
Granny's alive!

56:34.240 --> 56:35.309
And she's in trouble!

56:43.280 --> 56:44.633
Granny?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.631
Granny?
Granny?

56:58.320 --> 56:59.639
Is she okay?

56:59.880 --> 57:01.677
Uh, I'm not sure.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.873
Unhand my Granny!

57:08.040 --> 57:09.951
You do and
you don't get a tip.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.917
Making this beautiful
sloth happy

57:12.000 --> 57:13.672
is all the payment I need.

57:13.840 --> 57:16.354
You see?
Hunky bunny gets it.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.669
Granny!

57:17.840 --> 57:20.593
There's a bunny
living in the asteroid?

57:20.680 --> 57:22.033
Did not see that coming.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.509
Wait till you see this!

57:31.880 --> 57:32.880
Oh!

57:33.880 --> 57:35.996
Whoo-hoo!

57:36.080 --> 57:37.195
Yeah!

57:37.360 --> 57:39.510
Catching mad air
on the half-pipe!

57:39.720 --> 57:40.914
This is crazy.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.275
Do you think they know

57:42.360 --> 57:44.191
they are living in
a magnetic bull's-eye?

57:44.360 --> 57:45.429
Doesn't look
like a lot of

57:45.560 --> 57:47.312
doomsday prepping
going on in here.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.714
I can't believe it!

57:48.880 --> 57:49.995
Visitors!

57:50.160 --> 57:52.720
We've never had
visitors.

57:52.840 --> 57:55.559
Somebody pinch me.
Or should I pinch you?

57:55.720 --> 57:56.914
Wait, I'll pinch both of us.

57:58.240 --> 58:00.913
Did I hit my head?
What's happening here?

58:01.720 --> 58:03.711
I sure hope this
isn't a... Oh!

58:05.440 --> 58:07.351
dream!

58:07.760 --> 58:11.594
<i>Dream Weaver</i>

58:11.720 --> 58:14.871
<i>I believe you can
get me through the night</i>

58:18.800 --> 58:20.916
This guy? For real?

58:21.080 --> 58:22.957
Whatever.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.271
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

58:26.200 --> 58:27.918
Hello, handsome.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.433
I'm Brooke.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.749
Ooh. Such exquisite
bone structure.

58:33.880 --> 58:35.598
Such a strong jaw.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.069
I'm getting butterflies!

58:38.280 --> 58:39.872
I'm getting nauseous.

58:40.040 --> 58:41.936
Sorry to interrupt this
weirdo love connection...

58:41.960 --> 58:43.439
but we're kind of
in a hurry.

58:43.600 --> 58:44.999
If we don't do
something fast...

58:45.160 --> 58:48.277
that asteroid is gonna
blow us all to smithereens.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.595
Oh. That sounds urgent.

58:51.760 --> 58:53.432
I better take you to him.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.556
Who's "him"? Your leader?

58:55.760 --> 58:58.274
He is our everything.

58:58.440 --> 58:59.839
He sees all.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.228
He knows all.

59:01.400 --> 59:03.994
And smells amazing!

59:04.600 --> 59:06.795
Okay. He sounds great.
Let's go!

59:06.960 --> 59:08.916
Brilliant.
Right this way.

59:15.520 --> 59:16.560
Whoo-hoo!

59:16.640 --> 59:17.640
Yes!

59:20.840 --> 59:22.796
Please keep
your arms and legs

59:22.920 --> 59:25.309
inside the tram at all times.

59:25.480 --> 59:28.756
But allow your spirit
to roam free...

59:28.960 --> 59:31.155
in Geotopia.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.276
I have a good feeling
about this.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.873
Maybe he'll be
able to help us.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.598
She did say
he knows all.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.438
And all's a lot!

59:42.840 --> 59:44.159
Here he is.

59:44.320 --> 59:48.154
The Master of Meditation,
the Supreme Serene...

59:48.320 --> 59:52.029
the four-time Heavy Thoughts
champion of the world!

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.073
Is that a llama?
I hate llamas.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.878
They spit and smell.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080
So does she.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.912
So do we!

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.714
Oh!

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.239
Greetings, mammals!

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.393
The Shangri Llama
will see you...

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.709
now.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.915
Ooh. Wonderful.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.435
So where is he?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.670
He is here.
Talking to you.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.593
Oh, I get it.
He's a ventriloquist

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.914
and you're the dummy.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.037
No, you're the dummy.
No, you're the dummy.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.240
No, you're the dummy.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.696
This is the guy
that's going to save us.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.096
- Look within.
- You're the dummy.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.511
Disgusting! Loved that!

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.240
New topic.
We're all about to die.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.358
Well, that's no good.
Stress is a killer.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.114
Let us loosen our limbs
and open our minds.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.554
Downward Dog!

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.913
Uh... Seriously?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.072
I'll wait. I have all the
time in the world.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.616
Actually, you don't have
all the time in the world.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.235
None of us do. You see,
there's this thing in the sky.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.919
Oh. That blinding light

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.560
that seems to get
larger by the minute?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.870
What about it?
Seems fine to me.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.477
With all due respect,
Your Twistiness,

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.749
that's an asteroid.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.797
It's magnetically
attracted to this place

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.638
and it's heading
straight for us.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.591
Aha!

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.915
It must desire
our magnetic crystals.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.348
Well, who can blame it?

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.953
They're really
quite something.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.270
Did you know their power
grants eternal youth?

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.908
I am over 400 years old.
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.592
- That's not possible.
- Sure it is.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.553
I'm 326! Whoo!

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.478
Huh? You don't look
a day over 275.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.277
We are young, happy and safe.
And we always will be.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.113
Thanks to Geotopia!

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.998
Kudos. It is lovely.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.833
Now, let's figure out
a way to launch it into space!

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.150
I'm sorry. You want to
destroy our home?

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.112
It'll be destroyed
either way.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.470
But if we propel
this magnetic material

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.669
into the atmosphere...

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.638
we can change the asteroid's
path and save everyone.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.199
What do you say?

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640
Caterpillar!

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.113
So, is that a yes?
Or...

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200
Oh.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.834
You are storing
a lot of hostility

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.995
in your lower spine.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.136
Shangri Llama,
how are we gonna...

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.833
Funky Chicken. Jiggy Jelly.
Mashed Potato.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.275
Your flexibility
is a sight to behold.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.589
Now how the devil

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.160
are we going to
launch these crystals?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.032
You can't.
It's impossible.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.631
Whoo! I am bushed.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.674
Awesome meeting you guys.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.990
Feel free to hang or,
you know, whatever.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.875
Hmm.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.673
That's it.
He was our last hope.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.955
We're doomed.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.390
Yeah. All we got
was a free yoga class.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.120
On that subject...

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.713
could you help me, please?

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.519
My nose is dangerously
close to my butt.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.473
Uh, Sid, why do
you have two tails?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.278
I'm in here, too.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.519
Hey, don't cry.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.153
Look on the bright side.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.597
We get to see our lives
flash before our eyes.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.749
That means I get to
fall in love with you...

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.239
all over again.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.551
Only you can make
the end of the world

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.272
sound like a good thing.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.670
We did a good job
raising her.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.432
She's stronger
than we know.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.070
Two days ago, I'd have given
anything to keep her with us.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.391
Now I'd give anything
just to see her get married,

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.033
and leave home.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.078
Play with her kids,
dance with her husband.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.515
Yell at him when he forgets
their anniversary.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.758
It was a good one,
wasn't it?

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.392
Our life?
You, me, and Peaches.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.953
The best.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.438
Oh, Brooke.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.113
You're so pretty.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.595
You take my lisp away.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.594
I bet you
say that to all the girls.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.672
I try. But usually
they run away too fast.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.270
Oh, you're such a romantic.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.913
Hey, I know this is going to
sound super forward...

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.277
but will you be
my mate for life?

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.074
Oh, Brooke,
I don't know what to say.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.151
It's only been
twelve minutes.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.992
What took you so long?

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.752
Yes! This has been

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.308
the best last day
on Earth ever.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.358
A diamond!
I need a diamond!

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.595
Where can I find a...

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.637
Oh! Perfect.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.514
No, no, no.
Sid, sweetie, don't do that.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.357
Nonsense. Only the best
for my one... true... love.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.056
Whoopsies!

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.274
No, no, no!

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.318
Oaf! Simpleton!
Nincompoop!

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.038
You talking to
her or me?

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.989
That wall was the one thing
keeping us young.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.948
Now we're all
doomed! Doomed!

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.599
And now,
I think I have a fever.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.398
Thank you so much, doofus!

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.471
Hey! Easy there, Llama!

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.312
This is the doofus
of my dreams.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.469
He meant well.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.789
Oh, he meant well.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.712
Who cares?

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.875
So much for serenity.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.235
300 years of
peace and harmony...

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.552
undone by one colossally,
incredibly...

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.678
stupendously stupid sloth!

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.354
Oh, Brooke.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.590
Wow! You guys got old.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.751
Whatever we had,
it's over.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.388
That's what happens when you
date a cougar.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.751
I'm really sorry, Mr. Llama.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.519
Sorry. Sorry?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.953
Sorry doesn't fix
the wall now,

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.189
does it, you little...

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.037
I need a bubble bath
or a massage.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.394
Who knows acupuncture?

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.438
I need to let my
anger out. Let it out!

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.909
I've been pent up
too long.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.188
I want to hit something.
Someone give me their face.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.359
That's it! Pent-up energy.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.272
Earth's most powerful
propulsion device

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.753
is right in front of us.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.036
Who? Spitty McGee here?

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.279
The volcano!

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.237
That's our magnet launcher.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.239
All we need to do is seal
the steam vents around it.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.760
That's a crazy plan!

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.909
You're a crazy plan.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.593
That doesn't even
make any sense.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.240
And what are you?
A professor of logic?

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.759
Professor Kitty McWhiskers

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.560
of the University
of Meow Meow Meow Meow...

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.198
You see? Tremendous pressure

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.271
leads to
a tremendous explosion.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.310
And you call yourself
a professor.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.712
Right. We need
all the crystals

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.279
loaded into the volcano,
pronto.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.589
What? No!

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.273
I'm not giving you
my crystals.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.198
We need them to
rebuild our sanctuary.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.154
May I remind you
Geotopia is not yours to keep.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.320
No, you may not.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.152
It came from the sky,

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.032
and now it's time
to give it back.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120
Is not!

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.798
Is too, you old coot.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.474
Change isn't easy,
but it's part of life.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.835
It's time for us
to embrace it again.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.991
Whether you like it or not.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160
Not!

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.670
Listen, Llama, I will go
nuts and granola on your butt!

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.432
So either get on board...

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.670
or go twist yourself
into a pretzel

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.518
and na-ma-stay
out of our way.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.079
Come on, everybody.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.991
Grab every crystal
you can find.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.957
Totally,
let's do it!

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.634
And remember,
lift with your legs.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.518
Too late.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.151
Listen up,
planetary defense team.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.595
Step one, build pressure

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.029
inside the volcano
by sealing the vents.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
No steam can escape.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.275
If there's a leak...

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.431
the pressure is weak.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.796
Step two, get the biggest
magnetic crystals

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.995
into the volcano.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.071
They've got to be
launched sky high

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.957
to pull the asteroid
off course.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.678
- Heave!
- Ho!

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.558
- Heave!
- Ho!

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.517
<i>Rah rah! Sis boom bah!</i>

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.671
<i>Tell that asteroid "Uh-uh."</i>

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040
Whoo!
#Asteroid!

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200
# WhatDoesHashTagMean?

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.872
# IDon'tKnowButltSoundsCool!

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
# Totally!

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.639
# I'mStartingToGetSickOflt!

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:45.749
This is it, friends.
Down the hatch.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.399
Every crystal counts.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.474
Good news, everyone!

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.437
We're six minutes
ahead of schedule.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.511
Somebody up there likes us.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:32.078
Bad news! Somebody up there
doesn't like us.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.470
We're six minutes
behind schedule!

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.551
Double time, everyone.
We need that big crystal.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.953
Oh. Hey, Bro-Dad!

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.234
We got company!

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.436
Ooh. I'll put out
the sponge cake.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.433
Steady.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.835
Steady.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.959
Sorry about this.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.911
I'm really conflicted
right now.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.110
That's more like it, Roger.
Now finish him.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.912
Wait! Wait,
you don't understand.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.513
You see that?

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.631
If that asteroid hits,
we all die.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.358
If it hits,
we all die.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.279
That's where
you're wrong.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.476
See, while you run
for your mammal lives...

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.952
we'll be high in the sky,
cruising above it all.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.157
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.519
We'll be as safe
as those little birdies.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.991
Lucky shot.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.277
Very lucky shot?

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.510
I knew it. I was right.
There's no paradise.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.389
What? I'm too young
to go extinct!

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.115
She gets it! Now, please,
we haven't got much time!

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.315
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.948
No, Dad. I won't let you.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.390
Do you want to know what
I love about our family?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.312
That we're alive.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.680
There are more
important things

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.199
than your pride right now.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.998
If you care about us...

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.912
you should not kill him.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.036
You should help him, Dad.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.395
Pop, I hate to say this,

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.670
but my freaky little
brother may be right.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.310
As a father, I would
work with my worst enemy...

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.195
to ensure a brighter future
for my little one.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.355
Reinforcements
have arrived!

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.077
All right, Roger.
Lead the way.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.078
Oh! So that's what
approval sounds like.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.193
Keep it up, dinos.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.191
Use that Jurassic
super strength!

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.793
Beep, beep, beep.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.879
Watch out, kids!

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.994
The weasel has landed.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.755
I'll push it in.
Go with Peaches and Ellie!

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.431
No!

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.160
I'm not leaving you!
We'll do this together!

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.119
Mom, where are they?

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.269
Ellie, we've got to get
everyone off the volcano.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.914
Folks, I'm outta cake,
but I got salami!

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080
Faster, faster!

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.309
I'mouttacakebutlgotsalami!

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.000
Granny, come on!
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.630
This isn't working.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.156
Mad air on the half-pipe!

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.276
Manny, I have a plan!

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.271
We have to let
the crystal go!

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.874
You know we're trying to
get it in the volcano, right?

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.828
Manny, the only thing I want
is a life with Peaches.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.672
And to prove myself to you.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.479
So, okay, two things.
I want two things.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.877
Do you really think I'd waste
the only chance I have left?

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.319
Okay, let's do it!

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.670
On my count. One...

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.840
Two...

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.838
Three!

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.991
What are they doing?

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.718
Did it work?

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.715
Yes! I take back everything
I ever said about you!

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.632
Wait, what?

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.720
Huh?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.879
Now let's get out of here!

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.915
What happened?

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.640
Maybe it's the quiet
before the crazy?

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.428
Hmm.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.160
Eddie!

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.713
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.309
We did it. We did it!

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.192
In your face,
space rock!

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.510
Yeah, baby!

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.432
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Oh!

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.600
Hmm.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.557
Not on the lips, geezer!

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.136
<i>Hit the road,
you stupid rock</i>

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.798
<i>We just stopped
the doomsday clock!</i>

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.554
Yes! Yeah! Whoa!
All right!

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.672
Bring it in, Bro-Son.
Welcome to the family.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.390
And you, you coconut!

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.551
I'll never doubt you again.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.995
See? Daddy's always right.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.792
Remember that
when you're older.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.192
Are you sure
you can't come with us?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.079
Oh, Sidney,
I wish I could.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.710
But we both know
this is for the best.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.309
You've got your whole life
in front of you.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.358
Besides, I'll have Granny
to keep me company.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.351
You're staying, too?

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.512
Are you kidding?
This place is great!

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.229
Tonight's the big talent show,
and tomorrow, naked bingo!

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.555
You coming, Gladys?

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.272
I ain't getting
any younger! Whoo!

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.836
What? I can't hear you!

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.150
What? I can't hear you!
What?

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.079
You'll always be
my one true love.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.751
Here.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.069
Wow!

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.115
Hold on.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.871
It looks just like you.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.076
Now we'll be with
each other forever.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.559
So long, handsome!

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.034
Bye, Sidney!

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.119
What you need
is more fiber.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.389
He's right.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.273
Shangri Llama's
back on top, baby!

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.628
Ooh. Ah! Mmm.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800
Gladys?

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.479
Well, hello Teddy Bear!

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.712
Mmm-hmm.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.634
Hot tubbin' just got
a whole lot hotter.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.912
Amazing!
It's like some kind of

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.070
"Fountain of
Never Getting Old!"

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.791
Well, we can workshop
the name later.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.120
Where's the bride?
Why don't I have the bride?

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.157
'Cause you're talking
into a twig.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.496
Mom, I can't talk.
I'm at a wedding.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.616
<i>What do you mean
you can't talk?</i>

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.640
<i>Who are you with?</i>

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.352
Um, excuse me.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.671
Is it true you helped save
the world from an asteroid?

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.398
Um...

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.835
That's a very scary story.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.274
You think
you can handle it?

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.793
Yeah.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.029
How scary?

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520
Well, we were... Oh!
Oh!

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.874
Hi!

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.360
It was five minutes
to midnight...

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.351
and we were up
against volcanoes,

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.357
dino-birds,
and the end of the world.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.988
Oh, and the zombies!
Don't forget the zombies!

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.668
You know,
we'd be great parents.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.920
So I turn to Bigfoot,
and I say,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.194
"Listen, big guy..."

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.193
I don't know. I don't know!
What am I gonna do?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.670
Sweetie, listen to me.
This is normal, okay?

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.029
Everyone gets nervous.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.400
What's going on?
What happened?

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480
It's just...

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.757
I can't go. How can I go?

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.717
I don't wanna
leave you guys.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.357
Hey, Fuzzball...

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.710
remember the first time
that we played hockey?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.552
You were so afraid
to get on the ice

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.874
because it was slippery?

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.914
Remember how I held you up
while you started to skate?

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.548
And when I knew you were ready,
I let you go.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.349
Aw, Dad.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.671
I know you're ready.
Now you have to let go.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.274
I always knew it would take
someone very special

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.549
to match your spirit.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.553
And you found him.
Just like I did.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.517
It's your time, sweetie.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.591
See the world,
chase your dreams.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.556
And whenever you
decide to come back...

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.758
we'll be here, okay?

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.592
Okay.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.714
Oh.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.794
Do you...

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960
I do.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.155
And do you...

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.799
Most def.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.791
I now pronounce you...

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.319
Sid!

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.674
Brooke!

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.673
Oh! Whoa! Ow!

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800
Oops!

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.319
This is amazing!

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.159
You're young again.
And somehow, I'm still single.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.788
I guess the universe
was smiling on us.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.678
I have so many
questions for you.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.831
What happened?
How'd you find me?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.319
Have you tried the shrimp?

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.709
Shh. Close that pretty
little mouth of yours

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.989
and just listen.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.509
This is dedicated to
the sloth of my dreams.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.070
That guy? For real?

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.030
<i>Oh
Oh, Sid</i>

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.031
<i>Sid, baby</i>

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.559
<i>You make me so happy</i>

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.356
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would make it out</i>

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.353
<i>And come this far
Oh I never knew I</i>

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.313
<i>Would see the day
We come together</i>

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.715
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever</i>

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.840
Whoa!

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.429
<i>You</i>

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.669
<i>You make me happy</i>

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.118
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.272
<i>You make my world
a better place</i>

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.873
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.389
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.198
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.396
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.518
<i>My super crew
Stick together like super glue</i>

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.591
<i>We got the moves like yeah</i>

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.915
<i>We're shining bright</i>

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.792
<i>Throw your hands up
to the blue sky</i>

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.119
<i>You
You make me happy</i>

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.280
Sid?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.560
I never thought I'd say this,

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.160
but you did a great job
on the wedding.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.599
I owe you bigtime, pal.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.079
You sure do.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.878
Here's my bill.
What?

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.792
Father of the bride
pays for the wedding.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.399
It's a tradition
I just invented.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.993
Wait a minute,
this is ridiculous.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.593
Look what you're
charging for flowers!

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.875
Flowers ain't cheap.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.429
No! They're free!
We're in a forest!

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.749
This bill is outrageous!

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.913
<i>Mars.</i>

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.593
<i>The Red Planet.</i>

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.112
<i>Cold, dry,
inhospitable to life.</i>

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.113
But billions and billions
of years ago...

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.271
Mars looked like this.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.276
There were lakes,
rivers, oceans...

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.119
the perfect conditions
for life to form.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.754
So, what happened?

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.673
<i>Why was life
unable to take hold?</i>

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.158
Where did the water go?

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.319
We may never know.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.240
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would make it out</i>

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.471
<i>And come this far
Oh I never knew I</i>

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.028
<i>Would see the day
We come together</i>

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.712
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before</i>

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.876
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.035
<i>You</i>

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.037
<i>You make me happy</i>

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.116
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.237
<i>You make my world
a better place</i>

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.360
<i>You</i>

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.959
<i>You are my rainbow</i>

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.952
<i>You color my day so bright</i>

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.077
<i>I wanna stay forever
with my superstar</i>

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.200
<i>My superstar</i>

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.117
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.236
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.749
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.919
<i>My love, my love, my love</i>

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.669
<i>You're shining
into my heart, heart</i>

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.990
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would have it all</i>

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.473
<i>Would have it all</i>

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.068
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would feel so good</i>

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.639
<i>Would feel the full</i>

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.274
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would live the dream</i>

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.628
<i>It's so, so real</i>

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.314
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would see the day</i>

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.919
<i>We'd come together</i>

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.232
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before</i>

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.915
<i>Before, before</i>

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.035
<i>You</i>

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.792
<i>You make me happy</i>

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.876
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.997
<i>You make my world
a better place</i>

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.155
<i>You</i>

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.878

<i>You're shining
into my heart</i>

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.589
<i>Ooh, Dream Weaver</i>

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.193
<i>I believe you can
get me through the night</i>

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.833
<i>Ooh, Dream Weaver</i>

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:38.553
<i>I believe we can reach
the morning light</i>

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.073
<i>Though the dawn
may be coming soon</i>

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.796
<i>There still may be some time</i>

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:58.391
<i>Fly me away
to the bright side of the moon</i>

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:05.630
<i>And meet me
on the other side</i>

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.629
<i>Ooh, Dream Weaver</i>

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:18.598
