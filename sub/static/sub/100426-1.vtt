WEBVTT

03:08.923 --> 03:10.355
When Lord Aamon hears
about this,

03:10.357 --> 03:11.823
you'll all be punished.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.459
He knows what I've done
for the Southern Kingdom.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.569
You cannot treat
a Judge of the King

03:23.571 --> 03:24.570
like this.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.422
Silence!

03:26.423 --> 03:28.273
You will have your word
when we reach the castle,

03:28.275 --> 03:29.875
Judge of the King.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.927
No, please stop!

03:48.929 --> 03:50.395
No!

03:50.397 --> 03:51.430
Lord Aamon!

04:09.450 --> 04:11.283
And who is this one?

04:13.487 --> 04:14.720
Lord Aamon--

04:14.722 --> 04:17.022
These guards have
crossed the line.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.241
They've taken me from my home
in Gamor

04:19.242 --> 04:21.459
and have yanked me throughout
the treacherous woods.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.295
They've made a grave mistake.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.563
They do not know
of my allegiance

04:24.564 --> 04:25.830
to the Southern Kingdom
and how I've served you

04:25.833 --> 04:26.932
with all my might.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.433
Did you not know
of his allegiance

04:28.435 --> 04:30.402
to the Southern Kingdom
and how he served me

04:30.404 --> 04:31.870
with all his might?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.641
Who are you?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.980
I'm Vangel of Gamor,

04:41.982 --> 04:44.016
Judge of the King of the South.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.051
I've served Gamor with pride
and vigilance for years.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.719
- I-- I-- I--
- Hmm.

04:48.856 --> 04:52.524
I didn't know this was
Vangel of Gamor,

04:52.526 --> 04:54.593
Judge of the King of the South.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.303
Lord Aamon,
have I done something

05:04.305 --> 05:05.971
to offend you?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.339
I don't know.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.679
But let's find out.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.063
Aamon!

05:33.967 --> 05:36.668
You're more than what you say,
aren't you, Vangel?

05:39.340 --> 05:41.473
- You've seen it.
- Seen what?

05:41.475 --> 05:42.507
What have I seen?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.709
What are you speaking of?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.612
Take him to the Fires of Mauna,
find out what he knows.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.131
Oh!

05:49.132 --> 05:50.649
I've done nothing wrong
to the South!

05:50.651 --> 05:53.618
Find out what he knows
and then dispose of him.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.786
You-- you have the wrong man.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.054
This is just a misunderstanding.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.122
It's nothing I can't clear out.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.056
I just need time!

05:58.058 --> 05:59.124
Please!
No!

05:59.126 --> 06:00.659
Lord Aamon, no!

06:00.661 --> 06:02.828
Lord Aamon, you can't do this!

06:02.830 --> 06:04.596
No! No!

06:04.598 --> 06:06.431
Bring in the next one.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.735
Keep it moving!

06:35.562 --> 06:36.395
Get up!

06:53.947 --> 06:54.913
Come on!

06:54.915 --> 06:57.716
Hasten your pace!

07:01.555 --> 07:02.954
Up!

07:05.659 --> 07:07.692
Get up, judge!

07:11.198 --> 07:13.932
The Fires of Mauna await you!

07:55.175 --> 07:56.741
Hey!

07:56.743 --> 07:58.043
That way.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.784
Rest here.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.678
I need water.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.900
What's the matter,
Judge of Gamor?

08:54.902 --> 08:57.302
Never got your hands dirty?

08:58.972 --> 09:01.072
It might surprise you,
I wasn't always a judge.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.541
Really?

09:02.543 --> 09:04.309
Then what were you before?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.945
Manager of your rich father's
mistresses?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.716
- Nah.
- No, no, no.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.952
I was a people watcher.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.855
I observed their habits,
their manners.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.209
You could tell a lot
from someone

09:20.210 --> 09:23.562
just from their expression,
their insecurities,

09:23.564 --> 09:27.032
their desires.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.068
I learned a lot how
about people can be bent

09:30.070 --> 09:34.940
to do what you want
as long as you can expose them.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.243
For example, your father,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.078
he never had a woman
on the side.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.430
Hell no.

09:41.431 --> 09:42.781
My mother
would castrate him immediately.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.016
There you go.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.053
But his father, he did.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.290
What was that?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.695
Oh, your father kept
other women, did he not?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.897
That's why you fell silent
when he made a joke about

09:58.899 --> 10:00.966
rich fathers running around.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.234
The look on your face.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.270
The look on your face.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.306
It's like he dug it all up
from where you tried

10:08.308 --> 10:09.240
to bury it all.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.343
You-- you bloody rich prick!

10:11.345 --> 10:12.210
I'll teach you some manners--

10:12.212 --> 10:14.112
Your mother!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.648
She was one of the mistresses,
wasn't she?

10:21.355 --> 10:23.388
You bloody liar!

10:23.390 --> 10:25.190
I'm no liar.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.258
I speak the truth.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.094
The truth about what I see.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.130
After all, I am a judge.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.633
Am I not?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.371
I say we kill him!

10:39.373 --> 10:41.773
I say we kill him now

10:41.775 --> 10:44.142
and tell them
that he died on the way!

10:44.144 --> 10:45.076
Huh?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.323
No!

10:58.959 --> 10:59.958
Get off!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.060
One more time!

13:13.460 --> 13:15.093
My Lord.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.266
The prisoner,
the Judge of Gamor.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.368
Where is he?

13:23.370 --> 13:24.969
We don't know.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.021
Samael.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.324
Find him.

13:46.326 --> 13:52.463
Is this Vangel of Gamor
worth the search?

13:52.465 --> 13:56.267
What if he's
not the prophesied one?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.903
How can we be certain
that the prisoner

13:58.905 --> 14:00.972
is one of the Five?

14:00.974 --> 14:04.008
He's seen the vision
of the North.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.211
Why would the North choose
a wretch like him?

14:06.213 --> 14:08.079
Are you questioning me?

14:08.081 --> 14:10.348
Lord Aamon, forgive me.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.117
My men and I will search for him
high and low.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.119
We will not stop
until he is found.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.055
Bring him back alive.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:04.204 --> 15:05.637
Easy, easy!

16:04.230 --> 16:07.165
How'd you get your chains off?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.399
Rock over there.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.988
What's your name?

16:30.690 --> 16:31.656
Bandy.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.724
You?

16:34.561 --> 16:36.361
Vangel.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.996
Where were they taking you?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.033
Fires of Mauna.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.568
Me as well!

16:43.570 --> 16:45.403
My whole village was captured.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.704
No reason.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.142
Now what town are you from?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.483
Gamor.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.153
Gamor, huh?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.722
Gamor's no better
than this wretched place.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.093
Judging by your accent

17:09.095 --> 17:12.063
and calloused,
coal-ridden hands,

17:13.433 --> 17:17.035
I'd say you were dragged
from the mining town of Warda.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.670
What are you?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.672
A thief?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.107
A swindler.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.376
That's it, isn't it?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.644
Swindled your way to the top
of that god-forsaken city

17:27.647 --> 17:29.414
of scoundrels.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.816
You know, there's a saying
where I'm from.

17:31.818 --> 17:36.721
"Remain in the pits
or trample others to get out."

17:40.393 --> 17:42.593
There is a reason
they arrested you.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.798
Someone overheard me saying
I was leaving it for the North.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.799
Were you?

17:47.801 --> 17:49.100
Yes.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.437
Serves you right.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.505
Why would you do something
like that?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.608
They say the North is beautiful.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.777
It flows with life,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.446
with wonder.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.782
All I knew my whole life was
mines--

18:04.784 --> 18:07.185
Fairy tales for commoners.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.188
If-- if you're so important,

18:10.190 --> 18:13.191
then why are you stuck here
in this awful forest?

18:14.661 --> 18:16.327
There's been a mistake.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.096
And I'm going to clear it up.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.500
Awesome.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.603
I'm going to Aynor

18:25.604 --> 18:27.838
where they know of my reputation
and they'll clear my name.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.241
You're a fool!

18:30.243 --> 18:31.742
With those things on,

18:31.744 --> 18:33.511
you won't make it past
the city gates

18:33.513 --> 18:36.347
before they throw you
into the dungeon.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.250
So how do we get them off?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.519
There a blacksmith
in these parts?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.456
No heat could remove these.

18:45.458 --> 18:50.428
These are crafted by dark power.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.797
Then what do we do?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.700
If we want these off,
we need a light-bearer.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.735
Someone with the power of light.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.171
Light-bearers
have been appearing

19:00.173 --> 19:02.640
in the Northern Kingdom.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.643
People have been experiencing
supernatural things.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.179
It's a sign of the times.

19:08.181 --> 19:14.318
My friend,
these are fairy tales.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.920
Fairy tales or not...

19:15.922 --> 19:18.789
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting tired of these.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.261
If I come with you to the North,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.363
will you get
these bloody things off?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.266
How far is it to Aynor?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.901
Just south of the border.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.669
If we go together,

19:31.671 --> 19:34.305
you have a better chance
of making it.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.375
I killed that guy,
just like that.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.943
I'm a killer.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.601
You didn't kill that guard.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.238
I didn't kill that guard.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.275
I have a bad feeling about this.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.444
Did you notice?

20:46.446 --> 20:50.448
I haven't seen a fox for days!

20:50.450 --> 20:54.885
Back in the woods of Warda
I would see foxes every day.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.554
At least once.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.656
Sometimes twice.

20:58.658 --> 21:03.861
Sometimes three, four,
five in a day.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.596
You can eat fox.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.667
Not recommendable, but you can.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.904
I guess it doesn't matter.

21:23.416 --> 21:28.653
Sometimes three, four,
five in a day.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.521
You can eat fox.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.833
These--

21:42.835 --> 21:45.403
Shackles are getting heavier.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.671
Yeah.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.411
What is that noise?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.212
What?

21:54.213 --> 21:55.012
What's happening?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.814
What is that noise?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.318
Bandy.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.387
Huh?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.955
Vangel.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.991
Vangel.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.429
Vangel.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.532
Vangel.

22:14.534 --> 22:14.965
Vangel.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.000
Oh, oh!

22:19.439 --> 22:20.671
Oh, please.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.539
Vangel!

22:21.541 --> 22:22.873
Oh!

22:26.546 --> 22:27.812
Vangel.

22:27.814 --> 22:28.780
Vangel.

22:28.781 --> 22:29.747
These are getting heavier.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.749
Look at this.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.550
Vangel.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.685
These are getting heavier.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.553
Vangel, Vangel.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.487
Okay, stop.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.389
Vangel.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.423
Found it.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.825
Vangel.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.794
Hello?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.431
Are you lost?

22:50.470 --> 22:51.802
Are you okay?

22:51.804 --> 22:54.372
What's happening to us?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.775
It's the forest.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.611
It has been cursed long time
ago

23:00.613 --> 23:02.913
by the Dark Order

23:02.915 --> 23:05.783
to keep the pilgrims escaping
to the North.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.119
I can't feel my hands.

23:08.121 --> 23:09.653
It's okay.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.990
I have a cure.

23:12.992 --> 23:17.094
My family has been living here
for a long time.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.864
Yes.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.065
Come.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.867
I can give you shelter.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.602
I can take care of you.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.580
Come.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.649
Please eat.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.786
Sit down.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.065
Drink this.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.067
It will make you feel better.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.878
What is your name?

26:20.880 --> 26:25.282
I'm Vangel of Gamor.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.720
Bandy of Warda.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.188
Are you lost?

26:31.190 --> 26:35.693
We're going to the North.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.861
If you're heading to the North,

26:37.863 --> 26:39.363
you must walk the path
to enter

26:39.365 --> 26:42.666
through the Wicked Gate.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.369
Come with me
if you want to live.

26:55.748 --> 26:56.914
Wait!

27:00.019 --> 27:01.619
What was that?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.059
That woman, she's a witch.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.795
She's one of the many spies
of Aamon.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.664
Those who try to head
to the North

27:13.666 --> 27:16.200
will encounter them
along the way.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.035
Who are you?

27:20.740 --> 27:25.309
I am Elder,
servant of the King of Eos.

27:26.712 --> 27:30.180
There is no one King
over all of Eos.

27:30.182 --> 27:33.684
Maybe you're the delusional one,
Vangel.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.020
We've all heard the legends.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.791
Well,
definitely not from the South.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.478
Oh hell!

27:44.479 --> 27:46.863
You think you can just
figure everyone out.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.399
Can you believe it, Elder?

27:48.401 --> 27:52.302
This man was Judge of Gamor.

27:52.304 --> 27:56.340
I am Judge of Gamor.

27:57.977 --> 28:02.413
Once I get these shackles off,
clear my name in Aynor,

28:02.415 --> 28:03.881
I'll be reinstated.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.749
Judge of Gamor,

28:05.751 --> 28:08.285
there's nothing left here
for you.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.021
And you.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.261
Do you want to see
with your own eyes?

28:47.426 --> 28:50.360
King Apollyon's shadow
is growing.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.963
His army's on the move,

28:52.965 --> 28:56.767
taking over once free lands,

28:56.769 --> 28:59.436
destroying everything
along the way.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.323
What is this?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.859
What does it look like to you?

29:22.995 --> 29:24.328
An army?

29:24.330 --> 29:26.330
King Apollyon's army.

29:26.332 --> 29:30.367
Why would the King of the South
be building an army?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.804
To prepare for the final battle

29:33.806 --> 29:37.508
to end the war with the North,
once and for all.

29:37.510 --> 29:43.413
A war of this size,
it would destroy all of Eos.

29:44.850 --> 29:48.452
If you choose to remain
in the South,

29:48.454 --> 29:52.022
you will serve Apollyon
in his army.

29:52.024 --> 29:55.459
And he's not ready
to lose this battle.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.332
There still is hope.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.337
Let's have camp for the night.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.182
What happened?

30:54.386 --> 30:57.354
How did they get away?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.493
Elder's with them.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.362
Powerful man.

31:06.632 --> 31:10.067
He blinded me with his light.

31:13.939 --> 31:18.342
For years,
you've never failed me.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.479
No.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.248
Never.

31:24.250 --> 31:28.318
I can forgive this one mistake.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.586
Oh!

31:30.489 --> 31:32.890
Yes, please.

31:34.660 --> 31:40.097
But tell me where did they go?

31:40.099 --> 31:41.899
I told you--

31:42.635 --> 31:44.501
I told you--

31:45.137 --> 31:47.671
I told-- ow!

32:02.922 --> 32:06.924
Tomorrow, you set off at dawn.

32:07.993 --> 32:11.261
To the bright seas
and rolling hills,

32:11.263 --> 32:13.330
finally.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.534
I always thought
these were just stories.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.308
The Judge of Gamor
finally gets it.

32:24.310 --> 32:28.211
If the South is amassing
an army of this size,

32:28.213 --> 32:31.715
there's got to be a reason.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.984
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

32:33.986 --> 32:37.554
There is so much you were
never told, Vangel.

32:37.556 --> 32:41.391
This war has gone on
long enough

32:41.393 --> 32:45.963
that our own history has
been forgotten.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.966
Before the war between the North
and the South,

32:48.968 --> 32:53.503
our world was one,
the Kingdom of Eos.

32:53.505 --> 32:57.341
The land was fruitful,
their king ruled with honor,

32:57.343 --> 33:01.511
and the people loved their King.

33:01.513 --> 33:06.116
There was a man named "Apollyon"
who served under the King.

33:06.118 --> 33:09.453
His curiosity and desire
for more power,

33:09.455 --> 33:13.623
however, led him to the creation
of the dark powers.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.726
He launched an attack
on the king.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.263
But failed and was cast out
of the kingdom.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.999
Soon after,
he gained a following

33:22.001 --> 33:24.568
by attracting and seducing
men and women

33:24.570 --> 33:27.471
to the realm of dark powers.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.107
Apollyon eventually acquired
an army

33:30.109 --> 33:32.175
and began to take over
the territories

33:32.177 --> 33:34.711
from the Kingdom of Eos.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.116
Our world was divided
between the Northern

33:39.118 --> 33:41.551
and the Southern Kingdom,

33:41.553 --> 33:44.788
and the people
of the Southern Kingdom

33:44.790 --> 33:51.128
began to forget one true king.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.263
A prophecy was made
by the Interpreter

33:53.265 --> 33:54.598
of the North.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.802
The Interpreter spoke
of how the Five gifted ones

33:58.804 --> 34:01.538
will be called and gathered,

34:01.540 --> 34:05.675
and their coming
would be a sign of the times.

34:05.677 --> 34:09.246
That the final battle
will begin,

34:09.248 --> 34:13.150
and the North and the South
will be united again.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.384
You...

34:15.387 --> 34:18.155
You are one of the Five, Vangel.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.057
You have been called by the King
to do great

34:20.059 --> 34:23.260
and wonderful things
for his kingdom.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.430
We have searched high and low
in the Southern Kingdom for you

34:26.432 --> 34:29.199
and now we have found you.

34:31.537 --> 34:32.769
No.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.773
You've got the wrong man.

34:38.644 --> 34:42.212
The only journey I'm goin' on is
to get my life back.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.783
And me?

34:47.586 --> 34:49.453
What about me?

34:49.455 --> 34:50.554
You?

34:51.557 --> 34:53.156
You're nobody.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.494
But even nobodies are called
by their king.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.434
This...

35:05.704 --> 35:08.238
...is
the Record of the Ancients.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.778
Read it.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.814
It reveals the true nature
of our world,

35:17.816 --> 35:21.485
about the light
and the darkness.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.290
So Elder, you shall take us
to the Wicked Gate,

35:27.292 --> 35:29.159
see us through to the North?

35:30.762 --> 35:32.329
No.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.197
I am only a guide.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.366
I can show you the path.

35:37.836 --> 35:42.472
You are the ones
who must walk it.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.552
Where are you going?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.456
What an interesting guy!

36:07.733 --> 36:09.366
Vangel.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.500
Vangel.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.507
It's almost dawn.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.250
Bandy?

37:00.252 --> 37:01.518
Yeah?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.787
The Northern Kingdom
you told me about...

37:03.789 --> 37:05.655
Beautiful land.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.325
Flowing with waters and light.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.894
I've seen it.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.764
You've been telling me
they were fairy tales.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.301
In my dreams, I've seen it.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.837
How was it?

37:22.374 --> 37:24.608
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.644
You're lucky.

37:27.646 --> 37:31.615
All I ever had were stories.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.754
So uh, you're coming with me?

37:37.756 --> 37:40.824
Or you're still heading back
to become Judge of Gamor?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.928
There's nothing left for me
back there.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.431
War is coming.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.002
No one's safe.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.506
Let's go North.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.793
How did you become
Judge of Gamor anyway?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.897
Come on!

38:22.601 --> 38:24.634
You expect me to believe

38:24.636 --> 38:28.305
that you got
to be Judge of Gamor just

38:28.307 --> 38:30.473
because you're good
at what you do.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.310
That is exactly
what you should believe.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.544
Hmm.

38:34.546 --> 38:39.549
We all know the only way
to your position is um,

38:39.551 --> 38:41.484
through the back door.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.947
I've heard of this place.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.517
They call it
"The Lake of Doubts".

39:18.724 --> 39:20.423
Sure about that?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.930
You're jesting!

39:30.035 --> 39:31.568
Shall we?

39:31.569 --> 39:33.102
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:33.105 --> 39:34.838
Is there no other way?

39:36.708 --> 39:40.777
Bandy, it will take half a day
to get around this thing.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.681
Straight shot.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.586
Can you swim?

39:50.155 --> 39:51.855
No.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.123
It's shallow.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.092
Probably.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.200
It's actually not that far.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.805
Straight shot, eh.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.673
It's water!

40:43.675 --> 40:45.742
Come on.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.911
I have a bad feeling about this!

40:47.913 --> 40:49.813
It'll be fine.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.656
Follow me.

41:11.536 --> 41:12.769
Bandy.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.604
Vangel!

41:16.875 --> 41:18.074
Bandy!

43:11.056 --> 43:11.921
Stop.

43:12.857 --> 43:13.890
Stop, stop!

43:14.926 --> 43:15.825
Stop.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.760
You're not well.

43:19.297 --> 43:20.697
Don't move.

43:23.301 --> 43:26.603
Good, it's healing.

43:28.974 --> 43:30.306
Rest.

44:08.046 --> 44:09.045
Eat.

44:10.181 --> 44:12.949
You can't stay here
more than one night.

44:12.951 --> 44:15.918
The longer we linger,
the more endangered we become.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.820
Eat.

44:18.757 --> 44:21.658
Or stay here and die.

44:42.247 --> 44:44.113
Where are you going?

44:45.350 --> 44:46.849
Who are you?

44:47.819 --> 44:49.185
Sleep now.

44:49.854 --> 44:50.920
Rest.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.101
Feel better?

46:13.772 --> 46:14.771
Much.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.539
Thank you.

46:16.541 --> 46:17.974
Good.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.477
You'll need this.

46:21.479 --> 46:24.147
Keep your wits about you.

46:24.149 --> 46:25.448
It's time to go.

47:05.056 --> 47:06.255
Let's go!

47:13.865 --> 47:14.931
Stop.

47:16.935 --> 47:18.151
Stop!

47:18.152 --> 47:19.368
We don't have time to stop,
we have to keep moving.

47:19.370 --> 47:21.504
Please,
just tell me who you are!

47:21.506 --> 47:23.272
Even just your name.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.208
Help.

47:25.210 --> 47:26.976
I'm help.

47:26.978 --> 47:29.278
That's your name?

47:29.280 --> 47:31.080
It's not my name.

47:31.082 --> 47:33.115
It's who I am.

47:33.117 --> 47:34.917
What does that even mean?

47:34.919 --> 47:36.853
You're worse than this book.

47:36.855 --> 47:38.621
It's supposed to be a guide,

47:38.622 --> 47:40.388
instead it's just full
of riddles.

47:41.459 --> 47:42.558
If you knew
what you were carrying,

47:42.560 --> 47:45.361
you wouldn't be
so casual with it.

47:45.363 --> 47:46.562
And what is that?

47:48.967 --> 47:49.932
Hope.

48:00.311 --> 48:01.310
Vangel!

48:02.547 --> 48:03.646
Let's move.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.315
How do you know my name?

48:07.318 --> 48:09.652
Hey, how do you know my name?

48:09.654 --> 48:11.153
You said you were help.

48:11.155 --> 48:11.587
Who sent you?

48:11.589 --> 48:12.922
Why?

48:14.459 --> 48:16.292
The King.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.994
Apollyon?

48:17.996 --> 48:21.297
No, the King of the North.

48:21.299 --> 48:23.232
The King of the North died
centuries ago

48:23.234 --> 48:25.167
in the Battle of Pike.

48:25.169 --> 48:26.969
Haven't you ever read a book?

48:28.172 --> 48:30.006
The King is not dead.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.341
Have you seen him?

48:43.922 --> 48:46.188
Did Elder speak to you
about the prophecy?

48:46.190 --> 48:47.623
I think there's been a mistake.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.960
I'm not the one
that prophecy speaks of.

48:52.363 --> 48:54.130
I don't trust that guy, Elder.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.532
Left me and my friend
to die in the wood--

48:56.534 --> 48:59.602
Don't speak of things
you don't understand.

48:59.604 --> 49:04.273
Elder is a man of great honor
and humility.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.609
He lost everything
fighting this war.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.577
They call him the "Great Heart".

49:08.579 --> 49:10.479
Elder was the first of the Five
to cross

49:10.481 --> 49:12.281
through the Wicked Gate.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.985
I was the second.

49:15.987 --> 49:17.553
He was my guide.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.690
He was defending me
when Samael took his son

49:20.692 --> 49:23.326
and slayed him right
in front of us.

49:29.233 --> 49:31.367
You really believe
in the prophecy?

49:40.678 --> 49:41.978
I do.

49:45.049 --> 49:45.982
I do.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.533
They were here.

50:04.535 --> 50:07.570
Tell Lord Aamon we're close.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.472
He's really not dead.

50:44.308 --> 50:45.674
The King?

50:47.311 --> 50:49.512
You've seen him
with your own eyes?

50:49.514 --> 50:51.080
No.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.901
How can you believe
in something--

50:54.902 --> 50:56.519
I don't have to have seen him
to know him.

51:06.264 --> 51:10.399
You'll see
once you go into the North.

51:10.401 --> 51:12.435
He's in everything
that's beautiful.

51:13.704 --> 51:18.474
He's in the trees,
he's in the light.

51:21.279 --> 51:23.345
You'll see him in the citizens
of the North.

51:25.183 --> 51:30.820
And once you've felt him,
you realize he's everywhere,

51:30.822 --> 51:32.788
even here in the South.

51:34.325 --> 51:36.158
You speak
as if he's a real person.

51:37.161 --> 51:38.527
He is.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.429
What's he like?

51:42.667 --> 51:46.368
He's strong
like a hurricane wind.

51:50.141 --> 51:51.574
But he's gentle.

51:55.346 --> 51:58.380
He's kind and he's just.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.485
There's no other king
worth serving.

52:04.689 --> 52:06.455
You'll understand
when you get to the gate

52:06.457 --> 52:08.324
and you meet Elikai.

52:08.326 --> 52:09.625
Who's Elikai?

52:11.195 --> 52:12.795
He's the Prince.

52:20.738 --> 52:23.405
The presence of the King
is strong with him.

52:28.279 --> 52:30.179
They chose me.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.750
Of course, they did.

52:34.752 --> 52:36.685
Not all of us are so pure.

52:38.723 --> 52:41.290
I wasn't always like this.

52:45.763 --> 52:47.596
What were you like before?

52:51.702 --> 52:53.169
Another time.

52:53.171 --> 52:58.340
But know this,
everything that Elder told you,

52:58.342 --> 53:00.476
everything that you dreamed
about the North,

53:00.478 --> 53:02.829
it's true, Vangel.

53:02.830 --> 53:05.181
It really is that beautiful
and it will change you.

53:05.183 --> 53:08.884
Guess I have to see it
for myself then.

53:08.886 --> 53:10.386
Of course.

53:11.589 --> 53:12.588
You will.

53:20.231 --> 53:21.363
Ezera.

53:24.235 --> 53:25.501
My name.

53:27.305 --> 53:28.571
Ezera.

54:51.422 --> 54:52.821
Hmm.

55:01.799 --> 55:02.965
We have to run.

55:10.941 --> 55:12.408
This way.

55:21.519 --> 55:22.685
This way.

55:26.590 --> 55:27.790
This way.

55:27.792 --> 55:28.924
This way.

55:43.774 --> 55:44.973
We're almost at the edge
of the perimeter.

55:44.975 --> 55:45.941
We just--

55:51.615 --> 55:52.948
Vangel?

55:56.921 --> 55:58.354
Vangel?

56:14.038 --> 56:16.872
Hear that, let's go!

59:19.156 --> 59:20.289
Vangel.

59:23.193 --> 59:25.193
I've always been with you.

59:28.098 --> 59:29.331
Vangel.

59:40.110 --> 59:41.843
Oh, hello there, friend.

59:43.614 --> 59:46.682
You took a bit of a tumble.

59:47.351 --> 59:48.350
Come on.

59:48.352 --> 59:49.651
Let's get you up.

59:50.354 --> 59:51.219
There you go.

59:51.221 --> 59:52.054
Come on.

59:52.056 --> 59:54.056
Oh!

59:54.058 --> 59:57.326
These are
interesting accessories.

59:57.328 --> 1:00:00.028
Found ourselves
in a bit of trouble, have we?

1:00:01.832 --> 1:00:03.231
Uh, no matter.

1:00:03.233 --> 1:00:05.667
Come on,
let's get you on your feet.

1:00:14.979 --> 1:00:16.378
What's your name?

1:00:16.380 --> 1:00:17.646
My name?

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:22.084
You, Sir, find yourself
in the grandest of company.

1:00:22.086 --> 1:00:25.654
Wiles Pratt,
your worldly wise man.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.356
You're a lucky man, my friend.

1:00:27.358 --> 1:00:29.375
Do you know that, friend,

1:00:29.376 --> 1:00:31.393
that I happened upon you
rather than some other person

1:00:31.395 --> 1:00:33.962
or creature
with nefarious intent?

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:36.048
No.

1:00:36.049 --> 1:00:38.133
You're in very safe,
very capable hands.

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:41.036
You'll be happy to know,
there is a town,

1:00:41.038 --> 1:00:45.040
not far from here,
where you can find sanctuary

1:00:45.042 --> 1:00:49.111
from whatever it is
that you're running from.

1:00:49.113 --> 1:00:51.113
Uh, name of town?

1:00:51.115 --> 1:00:53.348
Oh why,
the City of Deeds, of course!

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:56.284
Yes, Deeds,
where hard work is valued.

1:00:56.286 --> 1:00:59.021
Where by the sweat of your brow
and strength of your back,

1:00:59.023 --> 1:01:01.123
you can build a new life
for yourself.

1:01:01.125 --> 1:01:02.858
Start anew.

1:01:02.860 --> 1:01:05.894
Find peace, find healing.

1:01:05.896 --> 1:01:07.429
Start again.

1:01:07.431 --> 1:01:09.665
Does that sound good to you?

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:11.366
Of course, it does.

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:13.702
Yes, Deeds,
is where we are headed.

1:01:13.704 --> 1:01:16.038
What about--
what about my guides?

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:17.239
Elder and Ezera.

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:19.875
Them?

1:01:19.877 --> 1:01:22.277
Oh,
they're probably already there!

1:01:22.279 --> 1:01:24.780
Oh, did they not tell you?

1:01:24.782 --> 1:01:25.831
Oh!

1:01:25.832 --> 1:01:26.881
It's just like them.

1:01:26.884 --> 1:01:29.384
All travelers must pass
through the town of Deeds

1:01:29.386 --> 1:01:31.687
in order to reach
the Wicked Gate.

1:01:31.689 --> 1:01:33.455
That is where you're headed,
is it not?

1:01:34.792 --> 1:01:36.041
Yeah.

1:01:36.042 --> 1:01:37.291
Well, there you have it.

1:01:37.294 --> 1:01:39.695
Yes,
I'm sure they've already arrived

1:01:39.697 --> 1:01:41.129
I'm sure they--
they filled your head

1:01:41.131 --> 1:01:44.199
with all this nonsense
of having to go your own way,

1:01:44.201 --> 1:01:46.968
create your own adventure,
did they not?

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:49.204
That's just like them.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:50.806
They do that to everyone.

1:01:50.808 --> 1:01:53.975
No, Sir,
you will find a better life,

1:01:53.977 --> 1:01:56.144
a new life in Deeds.

1:01:56.146 --> 1:01:57.779
Let's make haste.

1:02:01.952 --> 1:02:02.868
Come on.

1:02:02.869 --> 1:02:03.785
You're doing well.

1:02:03.787 --> 1:02:04.986
This way.

1:02:04.988 --> 1:02:06.321
Are we almost there?

1:02:06.323 --> 1:02:08.156
Oh yeah, it's just up ahead.

1:02:08.158 --> 1:02:09.491
Watch your step.

1:02:09.493 --> 1:02:10.459
There you go.

1:02:12.062 --> 1:02:12.494
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1:02:12.496 --> 1:02:13.862
Stop, stop!

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:16.465
These are getting heavier
and heavier.

1:02:16.467 --> 1:02:18.200
Oh, not to worry, friend.

1:02:18.202 --> 1:02:19.234
In a moment--

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:21.436
You won't even realize
they're here.

1:02:21.438 --> 1:02:22.404
Come on.

1:02:26.376 --> 1:02:29.311
Ah, there it is!

1:02:29.313 --> 1:02:31.213
Welcome, my friend.

1:02:31.215 --> 1:02:35.016
The town of Deeds.

1:03:03.413 --> 1:03:05.180
There you are!

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:26.334
Be quiet.

1:03:28.405 --> 1:03:30.338
Or die.

1:03:31.175 --> 1:03:34.910
Oh, what did I tell you?

1:03:36.013 --> 1:03:38.513
Stay quiet.

1:03:40.450 --> 1:03:43.952
(Indiscernible speech)

1:04:00.938 --> 1:04:02.237
What happened?

1:04:02.239 --> 1:04:03.238
Wiles Pratt said--

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:05.373
Wiles Pratt is a mercenary.

1:04:08.478 --> 1:04:10.278
He works for Apollyon.

1:04:11.982 --> 1:04:13.915
Well done.

1:04:13.917 --> 1:04:15.317
Great!

1:04:19.990 --> 1:04:21.189
Shh!

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:28.129
He uses dark power

1:04:28.131 --> 1:04:30.899
to conjure the illusion
of sanctuary.

1:04:34.938 --> 1:04:39.040
You were foolish to listen
to that Wiles Pratt.

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:41.543
You should've held on to this
and stuck to the path

1:04:41.545 --> 1:04:43.044
to the gate.

1:04:45.182 --> 1:04:47.215
Let's go.

1:04:55.626 --> 1:04:57.392
Vangel!

1:04:57.394 --> 1:04:58.093
Vangel.

1:04:58.095 --> 1:04:58.960
Vangel!

1:04:58.962 --> 1:04:59.527
Vangel!

1:05:00.530 --> 1:05:02.297
Bandy!

1:05:02.299 --> 1:05:04.065
Bandy?

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:05.533
Bandy, hey!

1:05:05.535 --> 1:05:07.202
Bandy?

1:05:07.204 --> 1:05:09.304
Bandy?

1:05:09.306 --> 1:05:10.238
Vangel?

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.106
Hey!

1:05:11.975 --> 1:05:16.544
Hey, let's go to the North.

1:05:16.546 --> 1:05:17.979
Let me get you out of here.

1:05:17.981 --> 1:05:20.015
Yeah.

1:05:28.191 --> 1:05:29.457
Bandy.

1:05:29.459 --> 1:05:30.625
Bandy.

1:05:30.627 --> 1:05:31.960
Oh, Bandy.

1:05:32.696 --> 1:05:34.062
Bandy?

1:05:35.632 --> 1:05:37.032
Bandy?

1:05:39.303 --> 1:05:41.269
I'm sorry I left you.

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:49.611
You go to the North.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:06:01.156
Vangel, I'm sorry.

1:06:01.158 --> 1:06:03.358
We have to go.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.374
Wait, wait!

1:06:22.379 --> 1:06:27.415
Ezera, that thing is
still tracking us.

1:06:27.417 --> 1:06:29.517
He won't stop.

1:06:29.519 --> 1:06:31.486
Go.

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:32.520
Oh, no, no!

1:06:32.522 --> 1:06:34.322
No. No.

1:06:36.093 --> 1:06:38.226
She'll join us soon.

1:06:38.228 --> 1:06:40.028
She likes a good fight.

1:06:41.264 --> 1:06:43.264
You must reach the Wicked Gate.

1:06:43.266 --> 1:06:44.733
He's as good as dead.

1:06:46.670 --> 1:06:47.569
Go, go!

1:06:47.571 --> 1:06:48.536
Let's go.

1:06:48.538 --> 1:06:49.671
Go!

1:08:41.118 --> 1:08:45.120
The prophecy
cannot be fulfilled.

1:08:45.122 --> 1:08:48.490
The North must be stopped.

1:08:48.492 --> 1:08:50.792
They will never unite the Five.

1:08:50.794 --> 1:08:51.526
I swear it.

1:08:51.528 --> 1:08:53.228
Then destroy them

1:08:53.230 --> 1:08:58.266
and you shall join me
in the rule over all of Eos.

1:08:58.268 --> 1:09:00.235
Yes, Master.

1:09:23.727 --> 1:09:25.593
I came all this way for nothing.

1:09:25.595 --> 1:09:27.829
Go back if you still can.

1:09:28.798 --> 1:09:30.865
You're never gonna make it.

1:09:31.735 --> 1:09:33.168
You-- you're never gonna--

1:09:33.170 --> 1:09:35.336
You're never gonna make it.

1:09:51.488 --> 1:09:52.787
Peace...

1:09:53.490 --> 1:09:54.822
...I give you.

1:09:56.459 --> 1:09:59.727
Not the peace
the world gives to you,

1:10:01.898 --> 1:10:05.733
my peace, I give it to you.

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:26.321
I once stood where you are now.

1:10:27.357 --> 1:10:29.624
Wondering the same thing.

1:10:30.927 --> 1:10:33.228
Is it all worth it?

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:39.367
Is it?

1:10:40.637 --> 1:10:42.704
It's beyond compare.

1:10:46.009 --> 1:10:49.877
So what do you want to do?

1:11:00.290 --> 1:11:02.323
To go back is death.

1:11:08.265 --> 1:11:09.797
I wanna move forward.

1:11:55.445 --> 1:11:56.744
Ezera.

1:11:57.714 --> 1:12:00.081
Get Vangel to the gate.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:01.649
Come.

1:12:20.837 --> 1:12:26.908
Finally, today you meet
your weakling boy.

1:12:26.910 --> 1:12:30.812
Right in the open grave
where I left him.

1:12:32.615 --> 1:12:34.949
Get away, demon.

1:12:39.889 --> 1:12:41.689
Come on!

1:12:45.095 --> 1:12:47.028
If we can get
just over that hill.

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:49.931
You're almost there.

1:12:58.541 --> 1:13:00.975
Come on, old friend.

1:13:00.977 --> 1:13:04.512
I know all of your tricks.

1:13:05.682 --> 1:13:07.749
Why don't you try me?

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:40.815
Let's go.

1:14:27.864 --> 1:14:29.163
Let's go!

1:14:29.165 --> 1:14:32.033
Come on, come on, let's--

1:14:32.035 --> 1:14:33.634
Get ahead, get here.

1:15:15.845 --> 1:15:17.778
Vangel!

1:15:29.893 --> 1:15:31.792
Never again.

1:15:53.149 --> 1:15:55.149
Ezera.

1:16:00.189 --> 1:16:02.156
It's been a long time.

1:16:02.158 --> 1:16:03.591
I've missed you.

1:16:03.593 --> 1:16:04.792
You shut up.

1:16:04.794 --> 1:16:06.827
Have you missed me?

1:16:07.764 --> 1:16:09.030
You shut up!

1:16:09.032 --> 1:16:10.631
Shut up!

1:16:12.268 --> 1:16:13.701
A lot of men
in the Southern Kingdom

1:16:13.703 --> 1:16:15.870
who have missed you.

1:16:15.872 --> 1:16:17.838
Your talents.

1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:26.080
I didn't have a choice.

1:16:26.082 --> 1:16:27.848
Is that what you're telling
yourself?

1:16:27.850 --> 1:16:29.817
You shut up!

1:16:37.093 --> 1:16:38.292
Still beautiful.

1:16:47.637 --> 1:16:49.136
You're still so beautiful.

1:16:49.138 --> 1:16:50.771
You don't know me.

1:16:51.674 --> 1:16:53.941
You don't know me.

1:16:54.944 --> 1:16:57.278
Shh!

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.848
I really, really do.

1:17:02.952 --> 1:17:05.620
Does he?

1:17:05.622 --> 1:17:08.923
Please don't--
please don't tell him.

1:17:08.925 --> 1:17:09.890
Vangel.

1:17:09.892 --> 1:17:11.092
No.

1:17:11.094 --> 1:17:12.827
Please don't tell him.

1:17:13.663 --> 1:17:14.228
Have you met Ezera?

1:17:14.230 --> 1:17:15.997
Aamon.

1:17:15.999 --> 1:17:16.965
Don't listen to him.

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:17.932
Allow me to introduce you.

1:17:17.934 --> 1:17:19.867
Don't listen to him,
he's a liar.

1:17:19.869 --> 1:17:22.036
This is Ezera.

1:17:22.038 --> 1:17:25.373
She's a murderer and a whore.

1:17:25.375 --> 1:17:26.240
No!

1:17:32.782 --> 1:17:33.781
Ezera!

1:17:33.783 --> 1:17:34.749
Ezera!

1:17:34.751 --> 1:17:35.916
That's not who you are!

1:17:35.918 --> 1:17:37.118
That's not who you are.

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:38.853
The King freed you
from that darkness,

1:17:38.855 --> 1:17:40.287
he choose you, remember?

1:17:46.262 --> 1:17:49.130
I know who you are.

1:17:49.132 --> 1:17:51.032
You're a warrior of the King.

1:17:51.034 --> 1:17:53.000
Daughter of the North.

1:17:53.002 --> 1:17:55.870
You are free.

1:18:00.176 --> 1:18:01.375
You're free.

1:18:03.780 --> 1:18:04.912
Vangel!

1:18:07.283 --> 1:18:08.349
You came for me?

1:18:08.351 --> 1:18:09.917
Yes.

1:18:09.919 --> 1:18:10.951
Take me.

1:18:13.022 --> 1:18:14.255
Okay.

1:18:19.962 --> 1:18:21.796
Please help us.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:52.860
Prince Elikai?

1:19:00.269 --> 1:19:02.036
I don't understand that.

1:19:03.906 --> 1:19:05.072
Aamon.

1:19:07.276 --> 1:19:09.043
You dwelled in the light,
but you choose darkness.

1:19:15.284 --> 1:19:16.784
I understand.

1:19:16.786 --> 1:19:18.385
You understand what?

1:19:20.156 --> 1:19:21.388
Your pain.

1:19:29.398 --> 1:19:31.265
You understand nothing!

1:19:34.337 --> 1:19:36.237
Don't talk to me about pain!

1:19:37.774 --> 1:19:41.942
You speak,
but you just don't hear.

1:19:41.944 --> 1:19:46.147
You look, but you don't see.

1:19:51.020 --> 1:19:52.219
See?

1:19:53.422 --> 1:19:54.522
Remember.

1:19:55.925 --> 1:19:57.324
Remember your father.

1:19:58.461 --> 1:20:01.195
Don't talk about my father.

1:20:01.197 --> 1:20:03.397
Remember the man your father
wanted you to be.

1:20:03.399 --> 1:20:05.566
Talk about my father.

1:20:07.136 --> 1:20:09.403
Your father,
he served the light,

1:20:09.405 --> 1:20:11.872
so you wouldn't be
in the darkness, Aamon.

1:20:11.874 --> 1:20:13.507
And he's gone!

1:20:21.317 --> 1:20:23.250
You see?

1:20:25.254 --> 1:20:26.387
See?

1:20:27.957 --> 1:20:29.857
This is not you, Aamon.

1:20:40.603 --> 1:20:42.303
This is not you.

1:20:59.288 --> 1:21:00.855
Let go.

1:21:35.892 --> 1:21:37.224
Vangel!

1:21:43.532 --> 1:21:48.202
I've seen you before
in this exact spot.

1:21:48.204 --> 1:21:51.138
Those visions were given to you
as a glimpse

1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:57.011
into the Northern Kingdom
to give you hope.

1:21:57.013 --> 1:22:00.147
I've been with you
the entire time.

1:22:00.149 --> 1:22:03.250
The arrowhead
in the mountain pass,

1:22:03.252 --> 1:22:05.619
the cool breeze in the desert,

1:22:07.156 --> 1:22:10.157
the appearance of Elder
and Ezera,

1:22:11.928 --> 1:22:16.297
I've always been with you
and within you.

1:22:17.266 --> 1:22:20.034
I've known you for so long.

1:22:21.437 --> 1:22:23.570
Even before you were born.

1:22:24.974 --> 1:22:27.708
And watched you all these years.

1:22:29.312 --> 1:22:31.111
And I have longed so much
for you

1:22:31.113 --> 1:22:34.315
to be able to know
what's in the North.

1:22:34.317 --> 1:22:38.385
Still it was your journey

1:22:38.387 --> 1:22:42.022
and I could only point you
in our direction.

1:22:43.326 --> 1:22:44.491
Here.

1:22:45.561 --> 1:22:49.229
Specially, here.

1:23:20.329 --> 1:23:22.096
Vangel.

1:23:24.433 --> 1:23:26.734
You will soon understand.

1:23:33.476 --> 1:23:36.643
Righteousness and justice
are the foundation of Eos.

1:24:22.091 --> 1:24:23.624
I've seen this before....

1:24:25.327 --> 1:24:26.560
...in my dreams.

1:24:26.562 --> 1:24:29.596
The Interpreter sent them
to you.

1:24:29.598 --> 1:24:34.768
Visions,
that would lead you here to me.

1:24:36.806 --> 1:24:38.372
Why me?

1:24:38.374 --> 1:24:41.375
There are thousands
more deserving people.

1:24:41.377 --> 1:24:45.279
My father, he chooses
whom he chooses, Vangel.

1:24:45.281 --> 1:24:46.513
Your father?

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:49.583
The King of the North?

1:24:49.585 --> 1:24:51.385
The King of all of Eos.

1:24:53.155 --> 1:24:54.421
So it's true.

1:24:56.158 --> 1:24:57.291
He still lives?

1:24:58.761 --> 1:25:00.594
He never was dead, Vangel.

1:25:04.767 --> 1:25:07.101
I don't deserve
the King's mercy.

1:25:09.305 --> 1:25:12.506
No one truly deserves
the calling of a king.

1:25:15.144 --> 1:25:17.144
I have wronged people.

1:25:17.146 --> 1:25:20.681
I have sent people to death
that did not deserve it.

1:25:20.683 --> 1:25:25.519
Vangel, you were given a gift.

1:25:27.256 --> 1:25:29.723
You used this gift
for selfishness.

1:25:31.494 --> 1:25:34.728
But he knows you can use this
for good.

1:25:36.765 --> 1:25:39.666
You are the speaker of truth,
Vangel.

1:25:39.668 --> 1:25:41.735
What you did for Ezera,

1:25:41.737 --> 1:25:45.205
you broke her out of darkness
with truth.

1:25:45.207 --> 1:25:47.808
And you can do this
for many, many more.

1:26:06.428 --> 1:26:07.794
You made it.

1:26:08.898 --> 1:26:11.532
I don't know how to thank you,
Elder.

1:26:23.412 --> 1:26:26.780
Thank you
for what you did on the hill.

1:26:28.317 --> 1:26:30.584
For what you said about me.

1:26:47.269 --> 1:26:48.635
Vangel.

1:26:49.838 --> 1:26:52.439
Will you stand with us?

1:26:56.879 --> 1:26:57.844
I will.
