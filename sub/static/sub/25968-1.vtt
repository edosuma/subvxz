00:12.763 --> 00:14.932
I'm not sure what I'm
looking at here.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.850
There's blood all
over sub-block seven.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.727
I've got a corpse
in cell-block four.

00:19.770 --> 00:20.830
Make that two.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.314
You definitely need
to call Homicide.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.024
We have to sweep everything.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.734
Isn't good.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.653
I don't know what that smell is.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.489
I have no idea what could
have done this so...

00:41.750 --> 00:43.585
Doesn't matter what
I think, Rachel.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.676
I just want to help sort

00:51.468 --> 00:52.719
all of this out.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.514
I just want to

00:55.889 --> 00:56.974
be able to help you.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.275
I'm really sorry
about your friends.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.822
But...

01:12.698 --> 01:13.699
the best thing

01:14.157 --> 01:15.367
that you can do now

01:17.619 --> 01:20.414
is to tell me exactly
what happened.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.506
They're still out there.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.971
Unfortunately, Rachel

01:38.807 --> 01:40.017
there's nothing out there.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.937
I wish there was.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.738
Let's start with your friends.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.410
How did you end up here?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.209
Who is Sean?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.640
Here you are.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.867
Rachel.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.853
It's a really nice night out.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.396
Yeah, it is.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.775
This, this place is great,
by the way, really.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.610
Oh. Thanks.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.242
Only problem is, you're
gonna have to host, like

02:35.572 --> 02:37.199
everything now, I
mean it's too good.

02:39.785 --> 02:40.786
Yeah.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.789
It's an adult house and

02:45.123 --> 02:46.124
you're an adult.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.190
I'm sorry.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.174
No, it's OK. It

02:54.633 --> 02:56.385
happens to the best of us.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.136
You're an adult now, too.

02:58.971 --> 02:59.972
No, no, umm...

03:00.514 --> 03:01.741
I'm sorry about...

03:01.765 --> 03:03.660
us, and it's my fault, you know?

03:03.684 --> 03:04.977
- I wanted to...
- Sean.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.272
It's all in the past and...

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
don't sweat it.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.235
Really?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.698
Come, let's do what adults do.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.700
OK.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.721
- OK.
- All right.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.306
- Are we playing on the grounds?
- Yeah.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.416
Hey!

03:30.669 --> 03:31.670
Did you get that in?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.614
Hey, hey, hey, we're
wasting hours.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.723
Simmer down.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.893
This is a very important
moment in our lives.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.353
Ladies and gentlemen

03:48.979 --> 03:52.232
welcome to the first annual
Flip-Cup Championship

03:52.399 --> 03:55.044
at Rachel's new place.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.700
The second annual Flip-Cup
Championship shall be

04:02.117 --> 04:03.303
tomorrow.

04:03.327 --> 04:07.223
And the third annual
Flip-Cup Championship

04:07.247 --> 04:09.917
shall be

04:10.667 --> 04:12.896
Do you guys even care
about showmanship?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.230
You don't care
about showmanship.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.315
We don't.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.344
- OK. After three.
- Shoulders.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.012
One. Two.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.409
Focus, Sean!

04:26.433 --> 04:27.434
Don't help him.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.772
Go, go.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.082
I'm not kidding, bro. You
could go professional.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.892
All right, all right.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.227
There are no winners
in flip-cup.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.919
- We were definitely-
- No, no, no.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.629
There are only losers.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.131
Suck my dick.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.136
Correction.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.888
Oh. Oh, no, no.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.266
- There's a ride.
- There's one winner.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.952
- That's Nick.
- Who's that?

05:08.976 --> 05:09.977
No.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.331
Hey. Do not.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.528
He's gonna film them having sex.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.988
Where are they
having sex, though?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.105
What the fuck, Hank?
What are you doing?

05:37.129 --> 05:39.691
Hey, bro. What the fuck?

05:39.715 --> 05:40.716
I'm sorry.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.303
Super immature, bro.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.889
Just like the good old days.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.743
Hey, hey, hey! Be
careful with that.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.830
Please be a little gentler
with my merchandise.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.582
Hey, bro!

05:55.606 --> 05:57.876
- Oh.
- OK. Sorry, sorry.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.627
You sound great. Do you
hear the acoustics?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.320
- Shut the fuck up.
- Look.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.881
- Babe.
- It sounds good.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.048
- It's good audio.
- Hey.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.240
Baby, baby. Look.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.450
- Mmm?
- It's all gone.

06:06.992 --> 06:10.204
Hold on. If it helps, I
think it was romantic.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.056
- It's totally natural.
- Uhuh.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.809
- Completely natural.
- And hot.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.478
What's that butt stuff?

06:16.502 --> 06:18.062
- Oh my god.
- What?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.297
Yeah, my butt.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.174
This could be your
best work yet, Hank.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.176
What?

06:24.968 --> 06:26.446
- You.
- No, no.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.989
- I mean, it's good.
- Oh my god.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.264
But you haven't seen

06:29.765 --> 06:31.784
anything. Let me show you.
Hold on one second.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.912
- I think we've actually...
- We've seen so much.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.145
Too much, in fact.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.271
Let me show you this.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.916
This is my masterpiece.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.275
This is my piece de resistance.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.568
My

06:41.818 --> 06:43.904
- My David, my Mona Lisa.
- OK.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.447
Come on, what is it?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.677
Just put it in. That's the first
time I've heard that went well.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.995
Are you ready? All right.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.330
So what is this?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.958
Check. This. Out.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.218
Dude, this looks
like a real TV show.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.445
Thank you, Sean.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.072
You're welcome, Hank.
You're welcome.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.181
Sometimes I hear
things in this closet.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.603
Why don't you shoot movies?

07:16.979 --> 07:18.981
Oh, oh, I do want
to shoot movies.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.625
But sadly, in the industry

07:20.649 --> 07:22.067
there are only two
kinds of things

07:22.192 --> 07:23.402
- that sell.
- Mmm?

07:23.694 --> 07:24.695
Ghost hunting

07:25.654 --> 07:26.655
and

07:27.281 --> 07:28.574
- and...
- Oh, stop!

07:29.658 --> 07:30.659
You too?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.224
- Yes! Yes!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.308
Yeah!

07:37.332 --> 07:39.334
Dan, keep pumping, you're
gonna lose your teeth.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.816
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I lost, I
lost it there. I lost control.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.151
Isn't it a little exploitative?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.777
- You mean, exploitated?
- I'm sorry.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.802
It's not a word.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
Not a word.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.848
Aren't you exploiting people?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.702
I'm, I'm sorry, does anyone
here feel exploited?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.328
I don't feel exploited.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.413
Well, you wouldn't.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.998
- The kids.
- When you have a camera-

08:00.022 --> 08:01.583
The kids? Are you kidding me?

08:01.607 --> 08:04.002
They get paid better than
I do to do these things.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.486
- They're actors.
- Whoa, none of that's real?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.631
Ghosts are real, Sean.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.716
Yeah.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.884
So what, what's your budget?

08:10.908 --> 08:13.035
- What do you get for this?
- You have to pay actors.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.263
- OK.
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.224
And to buy all of
the crap I need.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.560
Like the laser thermometer.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.419
- What?
- What's that thing?

08:23.045 --> 08:26.608
The EMF meters, the
infrared cameras.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.966
Does that stuff actually work?

08:28.133 --> 08:29.843
Does it find ghosts?

08:30.886 --> 08:33.948
No. No, of course not. But
it lights up, and it beeps

08:33.972 --> 08:36.493
and it buzzes as
much as I need it to

08:36.517 --> 08:37.619
so it gets the job done.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.645
So you don't actually believe
in any of this stuff?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.104
Ghosts

08:41.605 --> 08:42.606
aliens

08:43.273 --> 08:44.274
the paranormal?

08:45.067 --> 08:46.735
- Yeah.
- Of course I do.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.422
But unfortunately they
don't apply the same sense

08:49.446 --> 08:52.050
of urgency that I do when
it comes to my productions.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.700
Fake it 'till you make it.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.993
Fake it 'till you make it.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.329
It's better than shooting porn.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.549
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.333
I've got an idea here.
It's kinda crazy.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.252
- Come on, bro.
- You guys are...

09:04.670 --> 09:05.814
Wanna help me make one?

09:05.838 --> 09:06.856
I just did.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.758
Carrie, I

09:10.008 --> 09:12.344
I want us, I wanna be
clear, I would never

09:12.594 --> 09:13.679
sell anything

09:14.263 --> 09:15.264
so

09:15.597 --> 09:16.598
Dirty.

09:16.765 --> 09:17.826
I have standards.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.202
Well, maybe a limited release.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.787
Dan might get one,
just one copy.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.980
Hey. What would we have to do?

09:23.981 --> 09:25.041
Well

09:25.065 --> 09:26.501
to make it better, we

09:26.525 --> 09:27.985
shoot something on location.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.988
Holmesburg Prison.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.198
Holy shit!

09:33.532 --> 09:35.868
Wait. You want to
film one of these

09:36.785 --> 09:38.036
- in a prison.
- No, no, no.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.806
An abandoned prison.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.916
No, no.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.144
I'm not doing it.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.604
Do you guys understand the
production value there would be

09:46.628 --> 09:47.838
- just going there?
- Yeah.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.151
I mean, and I promise you,
the place is haunted.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.528
Oh, that place is haunted, for sure.
For sure.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.970
What do you know
about this place?

09:55.137 --> 09:57.055
- It is really close.
- Guys, we're doing this.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.515
Guys, I'm scared of the dark.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.202
- Fair point.
- No way, I am not doing this.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.644
Oh, come on, baby.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.855
- It'll be kinda hot.
- So hot.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.499
Dude, Dan, fuck off.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.816
Guys, it's gonna be fun.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.194
I mean, it's gonna be, totally

10:10.569 --> 10:12.422
fun. Let's go take
our friendship

10:12.446 --> 10:13.506
to the next level.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.341
How are we supposed
to trust you, Hank?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.468
What do you mean how
you're gonna trust Hank?

10:17.492 --> 10:18.827
- It's friendly Hank.
- Well, he

10:18.994 --> 10:20.787
he did just film these
guys having sex.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.916
And, do you guys remember the
time in high school when, uh

10:24.291 --> 10:26.853
you know, Hank would steal
the answer keys for us?

10:26.877 --> 10:29.355
Or the time he drove his car
into my dad's boat trailer

10:29.379 --> 10:30.690
and then had me take the blame.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.299
Your dad was so mad at you.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.427
I will admit, not one
of my finest moments.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.763
Not one of my finest moments,
but outside of that...

10:38.222 --> 10:39.223
Guys.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.600
- I'll pay you.
- How much?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.101
One hundred...

10:43.936 --> 10:45.079
- bucks.
- Oh my god.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.915
Oh, look out for this
guy, one hundred bucks.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.233
- Oh yeah.
- Two hundred bucks.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.943
- Well, that's more reasonable.
- Each?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.445
Yes, Michelle.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.281
I will happily pay you all
two hundred dollars each.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.491
Oh.

10:57.741 --> 10:58.801
But as long

10:58.825 --> 10:59.826
as we do it

11:00.035 --> 11:01.095
tonight.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.180
- Yeah.
- You know, Hank?

11:02.204 --> 11:04.164
I was going to do it
to help your career.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.808
Thank you so much.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.793
- Look at the modest Rachel.
- Yeah, so...

11:08.710 --> 11:10.462
I was gonna do it for the money.

11:10.963 --> 11:14.383
I want my two hundred Dollars.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.362
All right, we're going.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.971
Hey, hey.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.807
- Don't crush this party.
- Yeah.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.440
So we're going to
Holmesburg Prison.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.110
My friends are idiots.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
It's gonna be fun,
it's gonna be fun.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.241
It's gonna be slightly
murder-y, but pretty fun.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.493
I'm scared as shit right now.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.120
Relax!

11:43.620 --> 11:45.539
We don't have to go
inside, we're just gonna

11:45.789 --> 11:47.559
stick to the outside,
take a few readings

11:47.583 --> 11:49.418
and then I'll interview
you all later.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.503
Just pretend it's super-creepy.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.648
- Pretend.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.691
Sure.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.133
So, what was with that

11:56.550 --> 11:58.350
weird tension between you
and Sean back there?

11:58.552 --> 12:00.345
What do you mean?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.639
I mean, are you sure it's over?

12:02.890 --> 12:05.309
Not, trying to be
gossipy or anything.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.769
I mean, I don't think I
could trust him anymore.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.706
That's all that matters
in the end, right?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.481
You still have feelings
for him, though?

12:13.317 --> 12:15.237
I think I always liked him
more than he liked me.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.031
So, is it gonna be dark,
like the entire time?

12:19.156 --> 12:21.742
Umm, I think that's generally
how the night works.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.786
Tell me you're gonna
bang Rachel later, huh?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.292
Is that a yes?

12:31.502 --> 12:33.021
We're doing it!

12:33.045 --> 12:34.379
Hey guys, we're gonna be, like

12:34.505 --> 12:35.815
we're gonna be famous out there.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.999
- But, because of this?
- You're gonna be pretty happy.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.653
I will try to avoid any
more cleavage shots.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.117
- Stop it.
- Why are you avoiding it?

12:42.141 --> 12:43.601
Well, at least of Carrie's.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.723
Care she does.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.160
No, I'm not getting
any cleavage.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.185
No cleavage.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.270
Don't buy the angle.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.064
- We're here.
- Oh yeah.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.276
Holy shit.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.820
- Can you believe this?
- There.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.280
She.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.799
Is.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.617
It's actually kind
of, beautiful.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.513
Cool. Uh, first impressions.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.639
First impressions.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.723
Let's go. What you got?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.433
This is awesome.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.625
That's right. It is.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.418
Uh, Carrie.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.574
- Give me, come on.
- I hate you.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.965
All right, very informative.
Thank you, Carrie.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.216
I got this.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.136
We're here at Holmesburg Prison

13:23.887 --> 13:25.156
an abandoned structure

13:25.180 --> 13:26.658
right in the middle
of Philadelphia

13:26.682 --> 13:29.268
- a relic of the 19th century.
- Seventeenth.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.204
Nobody knows how many inmates

13:31.228 --> 13:33.313
have died inside these walls.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.442
But we do know that their
souls are forever tormented.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.111
Dude.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.280
That was awesome.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.574
That was awesome. OK!

13:43.782 --> 13:45.951
- OK, now that's how it's done.
- Yeah.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.995
- That's lesson learned.
- Oh yeah.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.223
Everybody grab some stuff.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.287
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.709
- Now what do we do?
- Everybody grab some gear.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.378
Make it look like you're
all geared up and ready.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.814
- To hunt...
- Hell, yeah.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.816
- Ghosts.
- It's a fuck-up.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.151
You think this is big enough?

14:01.175 --> 14:02.527
Yeah, there's a lot
more in there.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.303
Everybody, I need you
all to have something.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.532
Suzy, uh, you can't just
use your cellphone.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.016
- Oh.
- What do we do with this?

14:09.141 --> 14:10.781
Point it at stuff and
wait for it to beep.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.312
Basically, yep, that's,
that's about it.

14:13.437 --> 14:14.438
So, guys...

14:15.564 --> 14:17.399
Dan's a natural. Dan,
you know what that is?

14:17.941 --> 14:21.695
That is a flur. That is the
best tool in the business

14:21.987 --> 14:23.655
for finding a ghostie

14:23.906 --> 14:26.200
a spook, anything you
need, you can catch it

14:26.366 --> 14:28.327
on that bad boy. Look at
that thing right there.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.494
Hey, hey Brooke.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.787
Yeah.

14:30.913 --> 14:31.997
No, you're gonna love that.

14:32.581 --> 14:33.999
Fun fact, they actually

14:34.124 --> 14:36.418
first thing they ever
used to find Casper.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.438
Anyone that has
ever found a ghost

14:38.462 --> 14:40.231
has found a ghost with a

14:40.255 --> 14:42.966
flur, a fluralizer, as
they say in the business.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.176
I'm so drunk.

14:44.676 --> 14:45.677
Hey, Brooke.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.471
You're even beautiful
in infra-red.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.640
No.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.582
- Please.
- What, what, I don't lie.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.394
How are we gonna fake
sneaking into the...

14:54.561 --> 14:56.372
How we're gonna
fake sneaking in?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.707
We're gonna fucking get in there

14:57.731 --> 14:58.815
that's what we're gonna do.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.192
- Oh.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.444
- What?
- What are you doing?

15:03.654 --> 15:04.947
Wait, I don't see a lock.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.760
It's a federal prison, we're
gonna break in? Come on, bro.

15:08.784 --> 15:09.910
No, I don't...

15:10.048 --> 15:11.888
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

15:11.912 --> 15:12.913
- Stop.
- Hey.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.082
- I'm not doing anything.
- OK.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.644
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

15:17.668 --> 15:18.877
We get kicked out, big deal.

15:19.628 --> 15:20.688
Dan!

15:20.712 --> 15:23.399
Guys, they're practically
inviting us in.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.223
Come on, whatever happens,
I'm just gonna walk

15:25.247 --> 15:27.195
- around the outside.
- Yeah, seriously.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.846
Keep up, Michelle. Just keep up.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.115
It's very tight. Dan boy
knows what it's like.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.183
If the big guy can get
through, so can you. Come on.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.078
I'm not gonna puss out.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.621
- All right.
- Serious?

15:36.645 --> 15:37.688
Come on, Carrie.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.565
Come on, baby. It'll be fun.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.316
Please.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.711
The stupid things I do for you.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.612
Oh, the stupid
things I do for you.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.507
So we're really doing this?

15:47.531 --> 15:49.425
- This is happening.
- I guess we are.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.053
- Uh, I think we're doing it.
- Atta girl.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.245
Nick, let's go.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.499
We're not the first
kids to sneak in here.

15:57.875 --> 15:58.935
That's right.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.628
- You're not sneaking in.
- What happened to adults?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.464
You're bad, Rachel. You're bad,
you're breaking the rules.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.986
- Whoo-hoo!
- We're doing this.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.863
- Oh my god.
- All right.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.555
Let's go!

16:11.680 --> 16:12.681
Here we go.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.528
OK, we're just gonna go
a little bit closer.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.787
How much closer?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.998
How much closer? Just
to the front door.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.625
Yeah, and we were just gonna
walk around the outside.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.610
Just think about it this
way, that's another step.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.838
- That's another step.
- What if we just stopped

16:26.862 --> 16:28.530
- taking steps?
- That's another step.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.049
I'm sorry, show of hands.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.926
Does anyone want to
stop and turn around?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.011
- Yes.
- Yeah.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.554
I didn't see any hands!

16:34.578 --> 16:36.014
I did not. Too late now.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.497
Hold on, hold on.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.458
I wanna get some
butt shots, come on.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.585
- Hey!
- Going butt shots.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.855
I'm talking about you, Nick.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.565
Why don't you try to
make like a real TV

16:45.589 --> 16:46.900
like a TV show that looks real?

16:46.924 --> 16:48.860
- Yeah, that's what I'm...
- Showing people's butts.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.778
Normally I get attractive
actors, you're right.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.095
This has really been a struggle.

16:52.846 --> 16:53.907
We're gonna go round.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.408
- We're gonna try the door.
- OK.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.672
- We'll go back.
- No, I mean...

16:56.696 --> 16:59.287
It hasn't been opened in
twenty years, I think I heard.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.498
I don't think anyone goes in here.
It's not gonna open.

17:01.522 --> 17:02.606
There's no way

17:02.856 --> 17:05.126
that when I push this
door, that it's going...

17:05.150 --> 17:06.502
I'll give it a
little nudge and...

17:06.527 --> 17:08.287
- A little nudge?
- And then we'll just push.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.863
Wait a minute. Hold up.
- Now what?

17:10.155 --> 17:11.795
- Let's just go.
- Use those muscles, bro.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.534
- Just...
- All right, guys.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.259
- If it doesn't...
- It's not gonna open.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.598
- It's locked.
- It's obviously locked.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.017
Dude, Hank, it's
obviously locked.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.481
- Let's just go, OK? Come on.
- Hank?

17:22.542 --> 17:23.919
Maybe you should let it be.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.046
Sean's right, it's,
it's not opening.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.015
All right, I'm gonna help you.
Let's do this.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.235
- Here you go.
- Guys, guys, guys.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.695
Oh my god.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.847
Don't go in.

17:35.389 --> 17:36.950
Please stop.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.392
Don't go. My god.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.370
Hey, this is like super illegal.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.271
I, I don't even
know what happened.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.859
Oh my god.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.117
Creepy.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.368
We should go.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.453
We should go.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.955
You're right, we should go

18:00.372 --> 18:01.891
- further.
- Stop it.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.104
Look at these...

18:25.105 --> 18:26.899
Look at these fucking cages.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.151
It's super creepy.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.715
You wanna hear something
really creepy?

18:33.614 --> 18:34.740
See this office right here?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.577
Forty years ago, the
warden of this place

18:39.286 --> 18:41.222
he was stabbed, to death...

18:41.246 --> 18:42.372
- Shut up.
- Right there.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.559
And that's not even the
most fucked-up thing

18:44.583 --> 18:45.792
that's happened in this place.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.252
Haunted, got it.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.422
Yeah, fucking haunted.

18:50.756 --> 18:51.798
What else happened?

18:52.090 --> 18:54.801
Biochemical weapons
research on the inmates.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.971
And the doctor that did the
experiments, Cliegman?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.325
First thing he said
when he got here was

19:00.349 --> 19:01.600
all I see before me

19:01.808 --> 19:03.685
are forty acres of skin.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.687
- Ugh.
- That's disgusting.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.106
It was like a farmer seeing his

19:08.232 --> 19:10.776
fertile field for
the first time.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.130
Jesus, Cliegman.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.155
That's sick.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.175
So let's spread out.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.201
- What? No.
- Spread out?

19:19.409 --> 19:21.971
Dude, that's rule number
one, you don't spread out.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.723
All right, because I
need you all to set up

19:23.747 --> 19:25.791
these infra-red cameras up high

19:26.041 --> 19:27.894
so that I can catch everything

19:27.918 --> 19:29.628
that you do and look at.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.172
Oh, and remember,
try to look scared.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.424
Hey, can you remind
me to look scared?

19:34.800 --> 19:35.860
Yeah, sweetie.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.071
Oh, and, umm, cell
phones in the bag.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.410
- Come on.
- No, we're not doing that.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.830
- Hey, hey.
- Cell phones, cell phones.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.272
- Come on.
- Why? Why?

19:48.689 --> 19:49.773
Why are we doing that?

19:50.065 --> 19:51.650
There's no service here anyway.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.193
OK, I see that.

19:53.527 --> 19:54.736
Good old stone.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.280
Seriously?

19:56.405 --> 19:58.091
So then what's the
point in leaving them?

19:58.115 --> 20:00.093
Because I don't want
you guys using them

20:00.117 --> 20:02.887
for flashlights
or Instagramming.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.414
I don't want you snapping, Dan.

20:05.706 --> 20:06.832
What about my snaps?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.835
- No more snaps, no snaps.
- No snaps, Dan.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.128
But really, though, guys.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.605
If there's one
thing I've learned

20:12.629 --> 20:13.922
in making ghost-hunting videos

20:14.173 --> 20:15.924
there's nothing scary
about cell phones.

20:16.175 --> 20:17.926
What about that movie
One Missed Call?

20:18.635 --> 20:19.803
I rest my case.

20:21.305 --> 20:22.556
You know what? Fine.

20:22.806 --> 20:23.807
Yes.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.518
There it is, there it is.

20:29.521 --> 20:32.191
Thank you. Relax, they're
not going anywhere.

20:36.862 --> 20:38.923
- Thank you very much.
- OK, but why do we have to

20:38.947 --> 20:40.347
- spread out again?
- You know what?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.594
I don't want to be
here all night.

20:42.618 --> 20:43.994
Exactly.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.287
Yes, Brooke.

20:45.579 --> 20:47.206
- Yes.
- Come with me?

20:48.040 --> 20:49.041
Uh...

20:50.167 --> 20:51.168
yeah.

20:51.627 --> 20:52.628
Umm...

20:53.045 --> 20:55.547
Uh, uh, uh, c, c, cool.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.759
- I got your back.
- You coming?

20:59.176 --> 21:01.136
Yeah, we'll, uh,
we'll take the north

21:02.471 --> 21:03.472
west.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.367
- OK. Right, come on.
- Yep.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.062
See you guys on the other side.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.898
What just happened?

21:16.568 --> 21:17.569
- I'm coming.
- Yeah.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.674
OK, so there's ten cell blocks.

21:21.698 --> 21:22.967
Right? It's like a giant wheel.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.052
There's a center

21:24.076 --> 21:25.678
and then there's ten quadrants

21:25.702 --> 21:27.454
that spoke out from it.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.748
I'm gonna put up all the cameras

21:30.666 --> 21:32.125
in the rotunda, OK?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.418
Follow me.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.271
Let's go, ladies, come on.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.190
Move the heels,
pick up the legs.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.694
- I mean, I'm not staying here.
- Hey.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.051
It can't be ten quadrants.

21:41.593 --> 21:42.636
"Quad" means four.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.305
We're following an idiot.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.100
Rotunda.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.402
Oh, oh yes.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.237
Oh yes.

22:00.779 --> 22:01.989
- Wow.
- Yes.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.592
- Yes.
- Ready?

22:04.616 --> 22:06.076
- Wow.
- Whoo!

22:06.785 --> 22:07.786
Wow.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.681
Whoo-hoo!

22:09.705 --> 22:11.683
This place looks like
it was built by aliens.

22:11.707 --> 22:12.708
Yeah.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.019
No, like a spaceship
or something.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.437
Right, this is
actually the, uh...

22:16.461 --> 22:17.689
the guard booth, where they'd

22:17.713 --> 22:19.566
watch everybody that lived here.

22:23.886 --> 22:24.928
We're gonna go this way.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.555
Umm, not such a good idea.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.700
You have fun, you two.

22:32.144 --> 22:33.538
Are you, uh, are you guys good

22:33.562 --> 22:35.748
to go up to that cell
block or that one?

22:35.772 --> 22:36.773
Alone?

22:37.274 --> 22:38.794
- It's groups of two.
- You'll be fine.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.488
All right.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.241
We'll go this way.

22:46.825 --> 22:47.886
Yeah. OK.

22:47.910 --> 22:50.454
Uh, just remember to put
the cameras up high.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.932
Yeah, yeah, cameras up high.
Got you, bro. Thanks.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.393
And that the red
light is blinking.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.543
Uhuh, red light.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.462
I'm just gonna be here.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.341
All alone, with an axe.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.094
Waiting to kill, all of you.

23:06.762 --> 23:08.448
And no one is listening.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.442
- What are you doing?
- I have something here.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.997
What? The camera loves you.
Look at this.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.249
Smile. Come on.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.858
You know you're having fun.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.503
You know you're
having fun with Dan.

23:21.527 --> 23:23.028
Stop. Turn the light back on.

23:28.325 --> 23:30.244
So, we're supposed to go

23:30.827 --> 23:32.955
- down the hallways?
- Yeah, I'm...

23:33.080 --> 23:34.915
if, if, if you want to

23:35.415 --> 23:37.000
go. I'd, I'd go, because

23:37.709 --> 23:39.795
we're in a prison, and I'd
like to go, but if it's...

23:40.045 --> 23:41.880
Do you, do you want to go, or...

23:42.089 --> 23:44.150
I don't know if like,
"want" is the right word.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.236
Should we, I feel like,
we've arrived here

23:46.260 --> 23:47.860
- at this junction...
- Yeah, I mean like

23:47.884 --> 23:49.724
- Hank, you know he's...
- in our relationship.

23:49.748 --> 23:52.295
I mean, I... do you want
to go down the hallway?

23:54.059 --> 23:55.060
Uh.

23:55.853 --> 23:57.312
This is for you,
just so you know.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.314
- Thanks.
- No problem.

23:59.982 --> 24:01.108
I got, I got you, girl.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.442
Yeah.

24:02.568 --> 24:03.628
It's so...

24:03.652 --> 24:05.529
Ah, fuck, this is creepy.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.580
This is sick.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.541
I can't imagine what it was like

24:17.833 --> 24:18.876
living here.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.044
I wouldn't even fit

24:21.670 --> 24:22.754
in one of these cells.

24:23.672 --> 24:24.691
There.

24:24.715 --> 24:26.633
I have no idea how
this thing works.

24:26.842 --> 24:29.636
No, let's just put it where
Hank wants it and get back.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.054
Oh.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.282
Oh.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.640
Do you think it's
working, though?

24:35.017 --> 24:37.895
If it's working, Hank's getting
a pretty good show right now.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.189
Uh.

24:40.898 --> 24:41.899
Oh, hey, Hank.

24:42.566 --> 24:43.567
You like what you see?

24:45.694 --> 24:47.154
What did you say sells again?

24:47.779 --> 24:49.406
Ghost-hunting and, porn?

24:49.740 --> 24:51.491
Nix doggy-style, I think.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.411
Uh. I have something
better than that.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.247
Suzy!

24:58.457 --> 24:59.833
Bet you can sell that, Hank.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.544
Not before he jerks
off to it first.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.940
Do you wanna give him
something to jerk off to?

25:05.964 --> 25:08.109
Huh?

25:08.133 --> 25:11.011
Suzy, what are you doing?
Hank's going to watch this.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.222
That's what makes it so hot.

25:18.936 --> 25:21.206
Oh my god!

25:21.230 --> 25:24.107
- You're insane!
- You loved it.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.336
- Duh.
- Hank's gonna love it, too.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.361
Oh my god.

25:30.239 --> 25:31.365
- Oh.
- What's it now?

25:33.450 --> 25:34.701
Oh shit.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.372
That's fucking crazy.

25:38.664 --> 25:40.749
Which part?

25:41.375 --> 25:42.376
The tree.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.937
- The tree?
- Yeah, the tree.

25:43.961 --> 25:45.438
There's a tree growing
in the prison.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.148
- Oh is there? I didn't see that.
- Yeah.

25:47.172 --> 25:48.757
How do you think that happened?

25:49.049 --> 25:50.425
Someone planted a seed.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.470
And then there was a tree.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.058
Hm, there's a book, too.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.994
Uh, it's Shawshank Redemption.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.037
No.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.341
- Yeah, yes.
- You know for sure?

26:02.365 --> 26:03.783
- For a fact?
- For a fact.

26:04.189 --> 26:05.542
And then when they
got to the part

26:05.566 --> 26:07.168
where they're supposed
to dig a hole...

26:07.192 --> 26:08.670
- Uhuh?
- They buried a tree.

26:13.866 --> 26:15.635
Oh my god.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.179
- No, no.
- This is fucking gross.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.889
It's OK. We'll just
put the camera

26:19.913 --> 26:21.307
where we need to and get back.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.559
We'll get this over with.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.936
- Holy shit.
- It's so fucking dark in here.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.546
- I hate this, Michelle.
- You have a flashlight, Suzy.

26:28.088 --> 26:29.732
And you and me. I'm
fine, we've got this.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.676
- Let's make it better, though.
- We've got this.

26:32.843 --> 26:34.511
Oh my god. Eww, what
the fuck is that?

26:35.095 --> 26:36.471
Can you imagine having to

26:36.680 --> 26:38.056
be stuck in that cell

26:38.223 --> 26:39.516
your whole fucking life?

26:39.683 --> 26:40.684
Oh my god, no.

26:40.851 --> 26:42.186
Like, where are the windows?

26:42.644 --> 26:43.770
How do you see outside?

26:43.979 --> 26:45.230
It's a prison, Suz.

26:45.856 --> 26:46.875
I'm just saying.

26:46.899 --> 26:48.293
If there were windows
in this place

26:48.317 --> 26:49.860
it probably wouldn't
be so dark, right?

26:53.405 --> 26:54.406
OK.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.534
This is gonna be so hot.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.746
Hank's gonna be so surprised
when he sees this.

27:01.121 --> 27:02.599
Well, he did say
nothing sold better

27:02.623 --> 27:03.999
than, uh, ghost-hunting and

27:04.374 --> 27:05.375
sex.

27:07.961 --> 27:09.588
What was that?

27:10.839 --> 27:11.840
I don't know.

27:14.259 --> 27:16.094
- What is it?
- I don't know.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.561
The gate is closed.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.733
- Did you close the gate?
- No.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.571
Come in.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.573
I don't think so.

27:38.951 --> 27:39.952
I don't bite.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.478
Oh, oh, look at that booty.

27:48.502 --> 27:50.045
Oh, that booty is...

27:50.379 --> 27:52.106
I like to see you
walk away, girl.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.131
Yeah?

27:53.298 --> 27:55.926
You sure do know how to

27:56.343 --> 27:57.987
how to make a girl feel special.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.697
What? I'm appreciating
the booty I love.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.348
- Uhuh?
- An aficionado of

28:01.723 --> 28:02.933
booty-s.

28:07.646 --> 28:08.647
Uh-oh.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.482
Did...?

28:10.649 --> 28:12.109
Did you just lock us in here?

28:12.901 --> 28:13.902
No.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.406
Did you just lock us in here?

28:18.824 --> 28:20.200
Oh, that wouldn't be too bad

28:20.868 --> 28:21.869
now, would it?

28:22.494 --> 28:24.079
Yes, Dan, it would!

28:24.371 --> 28:25.372
Did you...

28:27.791 --> 28:29.084
What are you, what
are you doing?

28:29.501 --> 28:31.211
It's like Orange
is the New Black.

28:31.712 --> 28:34.482
But with, like, a dude.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.443
- Cut it out, Dan!
- What?

28:37.467 --> 28:39.404
- The fuck?
- I'm just kidding.

28:39.428 --> 28:40.655
Jesus Christ.

28:40.679 --> 28:42.306
Come on, you look
so hot on camera.

28:43.265 --> 28:44.725
- God!
- Do you think I'm crazy?

28:44.933 --> 28:46.268
That I'd lock us in here?

28:46.977 --> 28:48.979
This place is creepy as shit.

28:50.439 --> 28:51.773
Jesus Christ.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.238
It's amazing if
this thing works.

28:58.614 --> 28:59.990
It's just so dark.

29:02.284 --> 29:03.827
Hey. Check this out.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.708
Holy shit.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.004
This...

29:17.549 --> 29:19.429
They had to mark out like
each day or something.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.178
It's crazy.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.388
These are, maps.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.265
Books.

29:26.475 --> 29:28.519
So, how does this
thing even work?

29:28.769 --> 29:30.705
That's like, it's
like heat-sensitive

29:30.729 --> 29:32.147
so, like, picks up on heat.

29:33.232 --> 29:35.192
Oh, like, you're so hot, though.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.170
Like, look how hot you are.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.922
You're the hottest. No, you are.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.298
- Idiot.
- I'm, I'm not lying.

29:40.322 --> 29:41.990
- It just says it on the screen.
- Yeah?

29:42.115 --> 29:43.200
How'd you get that hot?

29:43.288 --> 29:44.928
- When, what?
- You rock, you're really...

29:44.952 --> 29:46.554
- What does it say?
- It says that you're

29:46.578 --> 29:47.871
- 55.5 Celsius.
- Well...

29:48.247 --> 29:49.557
What is that even? Obo?

29:49.581 --> 29:51.542
But Celsius, you're boiling hot.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.377
What? What am I?

29:53.710 --> 29:55.522
Oh, that's not a good face.
What's that face?

29:55.546 --> 29:56.672
- What?
- You're twenty.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.733
- You're twenty two.
- Bullshit.

29:58.757 --> 29:59.818
It's probably not working.

29:59.842 --> 30:01.402
- Yeah, it's broke.
- It's fine, it's...

30:01.426 --> 30:02.586
- It's broken.
- Yeah, it's...

30:02.886 --> 30:04.948
- It doesn't work.
- Ok so you try it,

30:04.972 --> 30:06.412
- I'm gonna turn the light off.
- Ok.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.816
What, what was that?

30:16.066 --> 30:17.418
It was probably
just a cat right?

30:17.442 --> 30:20.612
That's a big fucking
cat, turn the light on!

30:21.238 --> 30:24.575
- See, it's nothing...
- Get the fuck out of here.

30:27.369 --> 30:30.622
- Oh fuck!
- What... is that?

30:34.042 --> 30:38.130
- Look at this?
- Who designed this place?

30:38.463 --> 30:39.983
What does that look like to you?

30:40.007 --> 30:41.008
I don't know.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.012
Doesn't it look
like a crop circle?

30:45.304 --> 30:47.848
Yeah, kind of.

30:48.807 --> 30:51.018
Look at all the other designs.

30:52.436 --> 30:54.813
Is this one?

30:55.439 --> 30:57.983
- What's that?
- Yeah.

31:00.152 --> 31:03.321
The radio plan maintains the
central hub, from which

31:03.322 --> 31:05.049
those in charge, can
observe the inmates,

31:05.073 --> 31:08.303
and the patients, however,
rather than a single room,

31:08.327 --> 31:10.513
multiple corridors
branched from the center,

31:10.537 --> 31:11.872
like spokes on a wheel.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.309
This allows for central
observation, and access

31:14.333 --> 31:15.375
to all wings.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.253
This is so sick.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.554
Hey, is this the same place?

31:28.972 --> 31:29.973
What is this place?

31:30.307 --> 31:32.702
- I have no idea.
- Look at this map.

31:32.726 --> 31:33.769
Look at the,

31:35.187 --> 31:37.272
this isn't Holmesburg,
this is a...

31:41.610 --> 31:42.653
It's blueprints.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.362
Laura.

31:44.363 --> 31:46.490
- It's in a different language.
- Yeah, yeah, so.

31:49.701 --> 31:52.246
You think there's places like
this left all over the world?

31:55.290 --> 31:56.291
Sean!

32:01.296 --> 32:03.298
Nick! Rachel, come on.

32:11.515 --> 32:14.536
We, we heard a slamming noise,
and we saw that this gate

32:14.560 --> 32:16.560
was shut, and when we got
down here, we found Hank,

32:16.937 --> 32:19.123
- like this.
- How did this happen?

32:19.147 --> 32:20.732
Where's Susie and Michelle?

32:21.066 --> 32:23.569
Susie, Michelle!

32:26.572 --> 32:29.717
- What is happening?
- How did these gates get locked?

32:29.741 --> 32:31.535
Guys, guys, guys!
It's not safe here,

32:31.785 --> 32:34.580
We just got to get outside,
can you reach his bag?

32:34.955 --> 32:36.456
- Damn, damn!
- What?

32:36.748 --> 32:39.376
- Shit, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, huh?

32:40.252 --> 32:41.920
- You have your phone?
- Yeah.

32:42.171 --> 32:44.172
- Thank god.
- Oh, fuck.

32:44.173 --> 32:46.383
I have no bars, we
have to get outside.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.237
- What is happening?
- Look, we have to go back down

32:49.261 --> 32:50.262
the cell blocks.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.806
I mean there has to be
an open door, somewhere.

32:53.015 --> 32:56.119
OK, OK, so then we just meet
back here, just so we know

32:56.143 --> 32:57.328
where to go.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.062
I don't understand
what's going on.

32:59.313 --> 33:01.064
Right back here, Carrie, OK?

33:01.690 --> 33:03.567
- Henry!
- Let's go!

33:12.492 --> 33:14.745
- Susie?
- Michelle?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.168
Susie?

33:31.178 --> 33:34.223
Susie? Michelle?

33:43.398 --> 33:45.442
I still don't understand
what's going on.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.445
Hey, it's going to
be OK, alright?

33:49.404 --> 33:50.604
We just need to keep our cool.

33:51.573 --> 33:52.616
Find the girls.

34:05.838 --> 34:06.839
Fuck.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.136
What happened to Hank?

34:19.976 --> 34:21.257
It's gonna be, it's gonna be OK.

34:22.271 --> 34:23.563
Hank is dead!

34:28.944 --> 34:31.024
It's going to have to be OK.
We just have to find us,

34:31.047 --> 34:33.925
we have to find our way out.
OK, look at me, look at me.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.243
We'll find a way out.

34:40.330 --> 34:41.331
Oh, shit.

34:42.708 --> 34:43.708
Look.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.460
Look, look.

34:45.835 --> 34:46.837
It's going to be OK.

34:49.172 --> 34:52.025
No, no, no I'm not
going up there!

34:52.050 --> 34:54.050
- OK, I'll be right back.
- No, you can't leave me.

34:54.074 --> 34:56.368
- They could be up there!
- You can't leave me.

34:58.015 --> 34:59.516
I have to go, I have to go.

34:59.892 --> 35:01.643
OK, but just hurry.

35:05.314 --> 35:06.374
So no kiss right now?

35:06.398 --> 35:07.691
- Just go!
- OK, I'm going.

35:19.286 --> 35:20.537
Susie.

35:23.332 --> 35:24.875
Michelle?

35:27.419 --> 35:28.420
I'm OK.

35:32.049 --> 35:36.220
Susie? Michelle?

35:38.514 --> 35:40.224
What the fuck?

35:43.101 --> 35:44.102
Get off me!

35:45.729 --> 35:46.897
Help, help, oh geez-

35:54.530 --> 35:55.531
Come here.

36:14.424 --> 36:15.843
Is anyone in here?

36:21.306 --> 36:22.391
Did you hear that?

36:24.351 --> 36:25.477
What was that?

36:34.611 --> 36:35.612
Wait here.

36:39.032 --> 36:40.033
Hello?

36:42.786 --> 36:43.787
Hello?

36:51.712 --> 36:52.713
Hello?

36:55.966 --> 36:57.885
Hello, is anybody in here?

37:02.014 --> 37:03.015
Hello?

37:09.980 --> 37:10.981
Michelle.

37:11.982 --> 37:12.983
Are you OK?

37:15.903 --> 37:17.487
What are you doing in here?

37:21.074 --> 37:22.659
I dropped my flashlight.

37:26.788 --> 37:27.789
Stick with me.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.418
- Don't leave me.
- I won't.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.172
There it is.

37:41.512 --> 37:42.679
Carrie get in here.

37:44.014 --> 37:45.390
Michelle?

37:46.058 --> 37:47.267
Are you OK?

37:48.477 --> 37:49.728
Where's Suzy?

37:50.854 --> 37:53.815
Michelle, where is Suzy?

37:55.609 --> 37:56.610
We

37:58.111 --> 37:59.196
We were together,

38:00.447 --> 38:01.823
we were walking back,

38:04.910 --> 38:08.038
- something grabbed her.
- Something grabbed her?

38:09.248 --> 38:10.624
What are you talking about?

38:13.126 --> 38:15.587
I, this guys, and,

38:17.256 --> 38:18.340
its face.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.329
- I don't know, I don't know.
- What are you talking about?

38:23.353 --> 38:24.353
What is, going on?

38:24.721 --> 38:26.014
We have to get back.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.393
OK, OK, let's go.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.115
Where's Hank?

38:45.742 --> 38:46.785
Where's Dan?

38:47.911 --> 38:51.373
- Rac, where's Dan?
- I don't know.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.030
What do you mean you don't know?

38:53.054 --> 38:54.180
I don't know!

38:59.131 --> 39:01.484
You shit, you scared
the shit out of me.

39:01.508 --> 39:03.051
Hey, we just found
the way around, OK?

39:03.760 --> 39:06.138
Fuck what happened?
Hank is gone.

39:06.763 --> 39:08.867
Suzie is missing, and so is Dan!

39:08.891 --> 39:10.517
- What?
- What do you mean?

39:10.684 --> 39:13.228
- Something got them.
- Something got them?

39:13.812 --> 39:15.606
I'm sorry, what do you,
something got them?

39:15.814 --> 39:17.458
- I don't know, Sean.
- What do you mean,

39:17.482 --> 39:19.735
- you don't know?
- Sean, the camera.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.696
- Can we rewind it?
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

39:22.863 --> 39:23.864
Pull it.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.552
- Here, let me try, let me try.
- No, I got it, I got it.

39:27.576 --> 39:29.119
- Sean, let me try.
- Fuck.

39:32.497 --> 39:33.665
- Can you get it?
- Come on.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.167
Brooke, just.

39:35.667 --> 39:36.668
Come on.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.801
Come on, just, just
turn it this way.

39:45.636 --> 39:47.076
- Oh, fuck.
- Can you get it through?

39:49.264 --> 39:50.349
No, no, no, just.

39:51.475 --> 39:52.684
Just, here we go, here we go.

39:53.519 --> 39:54.561
Yeah, yeah, OK.

39:55.395 --> 39:56.438
We got it.

40:07.866 --> 40:08.909
What is it?

40:17.668 --> 40:18.877
What's happening?

40:22.422 --> 40:23.483
He faked it.

40:23.507 --> 40:25.300
- Faked it?
- What do you mean he faked it?

40:25.467 --> 40:27.928
- I mean he faked it.
- What are you doing?

40:33.100 --> 40:34.226
It's fake.

40:34.393 --> 40:36.395
What, I don't understand.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.272
Where is he now?

40:38.397 --> 40:41.108
Keep, keep watching it.

40:42.693 --> 40:44.570
This is gonna be one
fucked up night.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.366
What do you see?

40:51.952 --> 40:53.805
Nothing, he just smiled.

40:53.829 --> 40:55.080
He smiled?

40:55.539 --> 40:57.809
What is this some
kind of a joke?

40:57.833 --> 41:00.270
Well he just wants to shoot his
ghost hunting video, right?

41:00.294 --> 41:02.054
So the more we're running
around here scared,

41:02.078 --> 41:04.747
the happier he'll be. They're
probably all in on it.

41:04.965 --> 41:07.050
No, if Suzy were in
on it, I would know.

41:09.303 --> 41:11.471
Michelle said
something got Suzy.

41:11.889 --> 41:14.450
It sounded like
they was attacked.

41:14.474 --> 41:17.036
Well, did you see it?
Did you see it,

41:17.060 --> 41:18.604
with your own eyes? Did you?

41:20.105 --> 41:22.899
How do we know that you're
not part of this, Nick?

41:22.900 --> 41:27.881
- No, no, no.
- Wow, I'm going to prove to you,

41:27.905 --> 41:30.240
that I had nothing,
to do with this.

41:31.033 --> 41:33.386
I'm going to find that
little shit, and I'm going

41:33.410 --> 41:34.786
to beat the piss out of him.

41:34.995 --> 41:37.122
Nick, don't do that.

41:40.042 --> 41:43.438
Carrie, Michelle, just stay
there, I'm going to find

41:43.462 --> 41:45.064
another way around, I'm going
to come get you, and I'm going

41:45.088 --> 41:46.288
to get us all out of here, OK?

41:46.312 --> 41:48.314
- No.
- Hey, hey, I've got to do this.

41:48.592 --> 41:49.912
OK, this is the
right thing to do.

41:50.135 --> 41:51.136
Alright?

41:53.055 --> 41:54.097
No, keep it, keep it.

41:55.015 --> 41:56.058
You might need it.

41:56.558 --> 41:58.518
Alright just stay right
there, I'll be right back.

42:00.521 --> 42:01.647
Hank!

42:02.981 --> 42:04.191
Hank!

42:08.278 --> 42:09.530
Fuck!

42:14.326 --> 42:15.536
It wasn't Hank.

42:16.370 --> 42:18.247
Sweetie, it had to be Hank.

42:19.206 --> 42:23.585
I'm sure Suzy is fine, and
I'm sure everyone is fine.

42:23.710 --> 42:25.128
What did you see?

42:26.380 --> 42:30.843
It was like, it was
like, I don't know.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.012
It,

42:34.680 --> 42:36.306
didn't look human.

42:36.974 --> 42:38.868
- What?
- Hank is not the best

42:38.892 --> 42:40.727
in social situations, Michelle.

42:41.603 --> 42:45.148
I'm sure he doesn't realize what
he's doing is so upsetting.

42:46.191 --> 42:49.151
Yeah, I'm sure we're going
to look back on this video,

42:49.152 --> 42:50.153
and laugh.

42:51.780 --> 42:52.781
I just.

42:53.782 --> 42:55.927
Just never thought
Hank filming me naked,

42:55.951 --> 42:57.327
would seem so trivial.

43:00.539 --> 43:02.666
Second best movie you
made today, huh?

43:02.833 --> 43:04.459
Well, I don't know about that.

43:38.827 --> 43:39.828
Fuck.

44:17.241 --> 44:18.408
Oh my god...

44:39.263 --> 44:40.639
The little piece of shit.

44:41.890 --> 44:42.975
This is bullshit.

44:51.233 --> 44:52.234
Hank!

44:55.571 --> 44:56.572
Hank!

44:59.408 --> 45:01.368
This isn't funny, motherfucker!

45:09.334 --> 45:10.460
Hank!

45:13.046 --> 45:15.507
Hank, you little piece of shit.

45:20.179 --> 45:21.180
Hank?

45:23.473 --> 45:24.474
Hank.

45:26.476 --> 45:27.978
You piece of shit.

45:31.607 --> 45:32.608
Hank?

45:33.775 --> 45:36.278
No, no, no, no!

45:57.549 --> 45:58.550
Let's go!

46:01.845 --> 46:03.490
Go, go, go, go!

46:10.354 --> 46:11.605
What's wrong?

46:15.192 --> 46:16.777
What's wrong, what was that?

46:18.862 --> 46:20.322
Can you see what's happening?

46:29.206 --> 46:31.625
- It's OK.
- Where's Michelle?

46:32.334 --> 46:34.711
- I don't know.
- We have to go.

46:35.379 --> 46:36.463
We have to go.

46:37.714 --> 46:40.425
We have to go, we have to go.

46:40.843 --> 46:41.885
We have to go.

46:43.554 --> 46:44.555
Suzy?

46:49.351 --> 46:50.352
Suzy?

47:20.507 --> 47:22.092
Holy fuck.

47:27.055 --> 47:28.599
Hey, Suzy?

47:31.185 --> 47:33.562
Are you OK? What happened?

47:34.354 --> 47:36.690
I was just setting up
the camera and then,

47:37.816 --> 47:39.234
nothing after that.

47:45.741 --> 47:46.909
Sean?

47:47.284 --> 47:49.304
- Rachel?
- What are you

47:49.328 --> 47:50.329
guys doing?

47:51.163 --> 47:53.516
Help, he hit me.

47:53.540 --> 47:55.540
Hey, hey, hey, I asked you
guys to stay back there.

47:55.564 --> 47:57.858
- Are you OK?
- Carrie is dead, Sean.

47:59.254 --> 48:00.255
Wait, what?

48:01.131 --> 48:02.508
I think, she's dead.

48:05.552 --> 48:06.553
What happened?

48:07.804 --> 48:09.223
She was attacked.

48:10.307 --> 48:11.451
What is going on?

48:11.475 --> 48:13.310
Do you remember anything?

48:14.394 --> 48:15.395
No, I don't-

48:15.812 --> 48:16.939
Did you find Nick?

48:17.856 --> 48:20.460
What about Michelle and
Dan, where are they?

48:20.484 --> 48:21.485
We don't know.

48:23.403 --> 48:24.404
Listen.

48:25.197 --> 48:27.217
We just, we're going
to get out of here.

48:27.241 --> 48:29.511
OK, we're going to find
help, we'll come back,

48:29.535 --> 48:31.615
we'll find everyone else,
we'll get them out of here.

48:31.639 --> 48:32.682
Alright?

48:38.126 --> 48:40.963
Shit, turn off the light,
turn off the light.

49:02.693 --> 49:03.777
OK, come on.

49:11.743 --> 49:14.538
Stay with me, OK? Stay with me.

49:17.875 --> 49:20.812
You guys here? Stay behind
me, stay behind me,

49:20.836 --> 49:21.879
come on.

49:24.965 --> 49:26.565
This is the gate here,
I'm just going to.

49:30.929 --> 49:32.031
I'm going to stay back, and
I'm going to go through

49:32.055 --> 49:33.974
- last, alright?
- I'm not going first.

49:34.308 --> 49:35.601
First or last, Brooke?

49:36.268 --> 49:37.561
Last, just go.

49:38.645 --> 49:41.231
Oh my god, OK.

49:41.857 --> 49:43.859
Oh shit guys, is
that poison ivy?

49:44.318 --> 49:45.777
Are you serious right now?

49:47.821 --> 49:49.698
OK, alright, come on guys.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.909
Oh god, seriously?

49:52.784 --> 49:53.785
Be careful.

49:54.828 --> 49:57.205
I'm going to go through,
just come right after me.

49:57.206 --> 50:00.894
Alright, I'm going to go through
Brooke, just come right after

50:00.918 --> 50:02.169
me, alright?

50:03.170 --> 50:05.506
- Come on, I got you.
- Eww, guys.

50:06.256 --> 50:07.424
Slide through.

50:08.675 --> 50:10.844
You're OK, you're OK, come on.

50:18.644 --> 50:21.355
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

50:21.522 --> 50:22.856
Something is coming.

50:24.107 --> 50:26.902
Something's coming,
something's coming.

50:32.157 --> 50:33.951
- Help!
- Brooke, Brooke.

50:34.159 --> 50:36.912
- Help!
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:37.329 --> 50:39.456
There's still somebody
out there, OK?

50:40.958 --> 50:42.543
There has to be a way out.

50:43.877 --> 50:45.087
Where are you going?

50:47.130 --> 50:48.757
Alright, come on, come on.

50:49.800 --> 50:50.801
You're OK.

51:03.564 --> 51:05.148
Whoa, it's just me.

51:05.649 --> 51:06.900
You motherfucker!

51:08.694 --> 51:13.007
OK, OK, I deserved that.

51:13.031 --> 51:15.325
- What is wrong with you?
- What, I thought it'd be funny.

51:15.617 --> 51:17.286
Carrie's dead, Hank.

51:18.704 --> 51:20.497
- What?
- She's dead.

51:21.498 --> 51:24.333
And we don't know where
Nick, Michelle, or Dan are,

51:24.334 --> 51:25.544
they could be dead too.

51:25.836 --> 51:27.296
- Sean.
- They fucking could be.

51:28.589 --> 51:29.590
How?

51:31.049 --> 51:32.384
We were hoping you
could tell us.

51:34.344 --> 51:36.906
Fuck, wait, you
think I did this?

51:36.930 --> 51:39.409
- Well who else, Hank?
- We saw the tape, man.

51:39.433 --> 51:43.580
Dude, dude, for sure, I wanted
to freak you out, I wanted

51:43.604 --> 51:46.732
to see what you'd do, I
wanted to fucking scare you.

51:47.065 --> 51:49.193
- But that's it.
- How do we know that?

51:50.319 --> 51:51.737
- Somebody did it, Hank.
- Guys.

51:53.155 --> 51:55.157
- Come on.
- Then who did it, Hank?

51:56.491 --> 51:59.161
Someone is out there.
Somebody did it.

51:59.745 --> 52:02.122
- We have to find everybody.
- We have to get out of here.

52:03.790 --> 52:04.791
I can help.

52:07.002 --> 52:09.254
I, can unlock all the gates.

52:18.889 --> 52:20.557
How did you lock all
the gates, Hank?

52:20.849 --> 52:23.244
I came here a week earlier,
I pad locked the gates,

52:23.268 --> 52:25.628
- and put up all my cameras.
- Wait, there are more cameras?

52:26.021 --> 52:27.231
- Yes.
- Why?

52:27.481 --> 52:30.084
It's called coverage, Brooke.
It's what we in the industry,

52:30.108 --> 52:32.652
call coverage, I wanted to make
sure I got you all freaking out.

52:32.653 --> 52:34.111
OK, so we can look at the
cameras, and figure out

52:34.112 --> 52:35.821
- what happened.
- No, the police.

52:35.822 --> 52:37.842
- What?
- Maybe we can let the police,

52:37.866 --> 52:38.992
figure out what happened.

52:39.368 --> 52:40.744
Yeah, that's what I meant.

52:41.537 --> 52:43.830
- I don't trust him.
- I heard that.

52:47.709 --> 52:49.544
No, why don't we just go around?

52:49.545 --> 52:51.088
Fuck this, I'm not
going in there.

52:51.213 --> 52:53.298
- There's no other way around.
- Hank, Hank,

52:53.465 --> 52:55.865
if there is something out here
killing people, we need to get

52:55.889 --> 52:57.307
through here quickly,
and quietly.

52:57.511 --> 52:58.512
Something?

52:59.680 --> 53:00.973
What are you guys
not telling me?

53:01.181 --> 53:04.016
The only thing we know for sure,
is that we are all in danger.

53:04.017 --> 53:06.478
And we have to get out of
here, as soon as possible.

53:06.603 --> 53:07.604
We saw something.

53:08.522 --> 53:10.107
- Something that-
- Like a ghost?

53:10.649 --> 53:11.849
No, I don't believe in ghosts.

53:14.945 --> 53:16.196
What about aliens?

53:18.448 --> 53:20.260
I knew it, I knew it.

53:20.284 --> 53:21.535
Knew what, Hank?

53:22.327 --> 53:26.290
So this place, it's
like a hotspot.

53:27.040 --> 53:30.836
Like the Welsh Triangle, or
the M Triangle in Russia.

53:31.044 --> 53:34.797
- What's a hotspot?
- If there was life on another

53:34.798 --> 53:36.925
planet, this is where
they would be.

53:37.426 --> 53:39.011
- Here.
- What is that?

53:42.389 --> 53:43.515
It's this place.

53:44.808 --> 53:50.522
Exactly, exactly, so this
is where we are now, right?

53:50.731 --> 53:53.192
And this is why we
can't go around.

53:53.525 --> 53:54.735
But more importantly.

53:57.029 --> 53:59.698
- What does it look like?
- A crop circle.

54:00.032 --> 54:05.204
Exactly, and what,
do crop circles do?

54:06.038 --> 54:09.208
They're patterns, like helipads.

54:09.625 --> 54:13.044
But, there's this theory,
you know, like there wasn't

54:13.045 --> 54:16.941
a way to come here to make one,
or there was no reason to,

54:16.965 --> 54:20.302
because they're already here.

54:22.262 --> 54:25.641
I mean it's exactly where
they'd want to be, in cities,

54:25.933 --> 54:28.601
with all of us, because,
where else would they

54:28.602 --> 54:29.811
want to go, right?

54:30.062 --> 54:31.313
They're already here.

54:31.647 --> 54:33.981
Why would you want to come
here to build a crop circle,

54:33.982 --> 54:35.651
if we've already
built it for them?

54:36.610 --> 54:38.320
So you're saying an
alien killed Carrie?

54:38.487 --> 54:39.696
I don't know.

54:42.991 --> 54:44.591
I think you're trying
to shift the blame.

54:46.620 --> 54:49.706
Why me, then? Maybe
you killed Carrie.

54:50.749 --> 54:53.459
No, seriously, Sean.
Where you there,

54:53.460 --> 54:55.939
when Carrie died? Huh, was he?

54:55.963 --> 54:58.298
- Was he there when Carrie died?
- Brooke.

54:58.632 --> 55:00.777
- What, he wasn't there.
- Brooke!

55:00.801 --> 55:03.161
Well you said it yourself, that
you can't trust him anymore.

55:03.185 --> 55:05.145
- Wait, what?
- Sean...

55:05.806 --> 55:07.516
No, no, it's OK.

55:07.808 --> 55:09.977
No, it's OK, yeah
I wasn't there.

55:10.269 --> 55:12.288
But I also didn't come here
before everybody else,

55:12.312 --> 55:14.082
set up padlocks on
the fucking gates,

55:14.106 --> 55:16.106
and set up cameras, like
we're fucking rats in some

55:16.130 --> 55:17.131
kind of maze.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.963
- Maybe you did.
- What the fuck?

55:19.987 --> 55:21.446
Stop, stop it, stop it.

55:23.156 --> 55:25.437
Alright, you stay ahead of us,
and you get us out of here.

55:25.461 --> 55:26.910
And let the cops
figure out the rest.

55:27.244 --> 55:28.328
Fine.

55:32.374 --> 55:34.418
Come on, come on.

55:36.378 --> 55:37.379
Oh my god.

55:43.677 --> 55:44.720
It's just down here.

55:45.929 --> 55:47.139
I'm sorry.

55:51.393 --> 55:53.729
- Oh, perfect.
- What is that?

55:55.063 --> 55:56.356
It's my camera.

55:57.274 --> 55:59.275
What? I'm grabbing my camera.

55:59.276 --> 56:00.516
Can you see what that recorded?

56:00.540 --> 56:02.338
No, it goes straight
to my laptop.

56:02.362 --> 56:04.615
- So where's that?
- In the office.

56:04.865 --> 56:06.241
You've been planning
this a while.

56:06.408 --> 56:08.118
- Yeah.
- Well I hope it was worth it.

56:08.619 --> 56:10.954
Well in case you haven't
noticed, it worked.

56:11.779 --> 56:13.539
Well you know what I
mean, we found an alien.

56:13.540 --> 56:15.542
- People died, Hank.
- We don't know that.

56:20.923 --> 56:22.508
No, somebody definitely died.

56:23.091 --> 56:25.719
- Shut up Hank.
- This is so fucked up.

56:27.179 --> 56:28.805
Oh, shit.

56:32.726 --> 56:33.852
I'll check it out.

56:58.669 --> 56:59.753
It's Nick and Carrie.

57:01.129 --> 57:02.381
What about Dan and Michelle?

57:03.465 --> 57:05.551
- Where's Dan?
- I saw Dan.

57:07.010 --> 57:09.572
What? You didn't
actually see Dan?

57:09.596 --> 57:10.597
I thought I heard it.

57:12.558 --> 57:15.227
That's great, Brooke.
That's so great.

57:15.477 --> 57:17.312
- You heard it!
- Relax, Hank.

57:17.729 --> 57:20.542
Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm the
only one around here with

57:20.566 --> 57:23.628
a plausible excuse, and everyone
else is just pointing the finger

57:23.652 --> 57:25.012
- at me.
- Hey where are you going?

57:25.036 --> 57:27.330
I'm trying to get the
hell out of here.

57:58.854 --> 58:00.022
What are you doing, Hank?

58:00.147 --> 58:02.858
Well, if there is
something behind us.

58:03.233 --> 58:04.234
It's fine.

58:22.586 --> 58:24.546
- That's not mine.
- What is it?

58:29.760 --> 58:31.880
- I didn't put this here.
- Stop fucking around, Hank.

58:31.904 --> 58:34.324
- What do you mean, Hank?
- I mean that this is not mine.

58:34.348 --> 58:36.068
Give me the keys, give
me the keys, come on.

58:36.558 --> 58:39.204
I'm not lying to you guys,
I promise you, I didn't

58:39.228 --> 58:41.146
put that there, I
didn't buy that lock.

58:47.069 --> 58:48.779
Which one of you put that there?

58:50.364 --> 58:51.489
What are you doing, Hank?

58:51.490 --> 58:53.033
What are you doing?

58:53.158 --> 58:54.558
I didn't put that
lock on that gate.

58:54.660 --> 58:55.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:56.078 --> 58:57.871
- Hank, Hank.
- What are you doing?

58:58.038 --> 58:59.224
It's just a stun gun.

58:59.248 --> 59:02.852
Yeah, it's just a stun gun,
Brooke, it's just a stun gun.

59:02.876 --> 59:04.377
You want to know how
it feels, Brooke?

59:04.378 --> 59:06.171
Relax, Hank.

59:08.715 --> 59:10.384
I didn't put that
lock on that gate.

59:13.011 --> 59:15.156
Stop coming closer, stop it.

59:15.180 --> 59:16.431
Relax, I'm here.

59:16.932 --> 59:17.933
This isn't funny.

59:18.851 --> 59:20.769
I need your help, Hank.
OK we didn't do this.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.772
We're your friends, OK?

59:25.691 --> 59:27.771
Alright you know this place
better than we do, right?

59:28.861 --> 59:30.213
Then we need your help to
get out of here, you want

59:30.237 --> 59:31.381
to get out of here, right?

59:31.405 --> 59:33.156
OK, is this the only way out?

59:35.325 --> 59:37.244
Alright, so just
put the gun down.

01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:13.405
I can't see, I can't.

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:36.632
Come on, just stay with me.

01:00:42.768 --> 01:00:43.810
Just stay with me, OK?

01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:49.149
Hank.

01:00:57.199 --> 01:00:58.325
What is that?

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:07.417
Sean, the keys,
just give it to me.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:13.173
Go, go, go.

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:18.846
Rachel, Rachel.

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:20.430
Rachel.

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:31.149
Come on, OK.

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:08.812
You didn't trust Hank.

01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:11.273
What do you mean?

01:02:11.982 --> 01:02:14.151
You thought he might have
killed Nick and Carrie.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:16.880
- But he didn't.
- Rachel, I need you

01:02:16.904 --> 01:02:18.322
to stay with me, OK?

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:20.741
What did you see, Sean?

01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:23.535
I don't know.

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.709
Rachel, look, OK, I'm sorry.

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:33.629
I was wrong.

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:37.798
You have no idea how
much regret, I've felt,

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:41.177
how I've hated myself.
And you have every right

01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:43.823
to hate me. To never
trust me again,

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.849
despise me, doubt my
loyalty, whatever.

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:47.059
But he.

01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:54.149
You have to know,
that I love you.

01:02:55.484 --> 01:02:56.485
Trust that.

01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:01.197
You have to believe, that
I would never do anything

01:03:01.198 --> 01:03:02.199
to hurt you.

01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:04.993
Or anyone else.

01:03:07.913 --> 01:03:10.624
And I might not have been
strong enough to protect them.

01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:15.003
But I will protect you.

01:03:18.632 --> 01:03:20.008
I promise you that.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:31.228
Sean, look.

01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:38.151
OK, OK, come on.

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:39.736
Alright, come on.

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:45.325
- What is that?
- OK, come on.

01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:47.786
Come on, come on.

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:49.288
It's Hank's computer.

01:04:07.306 --> 01:04:09.558
Do you want to try to
just make a run for it?

01:04:17.316 --> 01:04:18.692
What the fuck was that?

01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:20.777
That's what killed them.

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:24.823
Maybe Hank was right.

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:26.491
Maybe.

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:29.869
All I know is, whatever that
is, it doesn't want us here,

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.110
and it definitely doesn't want
us to see what it's doing.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.845
How do we know it's not
coming here right now?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.921
We don't.

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:47.429
Look.

01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:52.184
Oh my god, is that Dan?

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:56.438
We have to go get him.

01:04:56.605 --> 01:04:58.416
Maybe Michelle's OK, too.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.240
Rachel we don't even know
if he's still alive.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.557
But he might be.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:03.987
And Michelle could be out there.

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.117
We have to go get him.

01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:15.374
So, what?

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:17.501
We just sit here?

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:19.753
Wait to die?

01:05:24.883 --> 01:05:28.428
Sean, you have to trust me.

01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:38.188
- He moved, he's alive!
- We have to go.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:39.833
- He's alive.
- Come on, we have to go.

01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:41.149
OK.

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:44.945
We have to go.

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:46.689
You have to give me a second.

01:05:48.448 --> 01:05:49.533
Hold this.

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:57.457
Come on.

01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:02.671
Do you see anything?

01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:23.275
What happened?

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:44.838
I don't understand.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:46.632
It's a gas mask.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:50.052
- What, but.
- It's just, a gas mask.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.990
- Why was she tied up?
- She was trying to get

01:06:54.014 --> 01:06:55.015
our attention.

01:06:59.019 --> 01:07:00.020
Oh my god.

01:07:16.495 --> 01:07:17.496
Dan.

01:07:45.357 --> 01:07:46.358
Sean!

01:07:47.901 --> 01:07:48.902
Dan!

01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:52.406
What is that?

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:54.616
Dan?

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:01.039
Stay back, stay back.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:18.221
- Fuck, dude.
- Why were you wearing

01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:20.765
- a gas mask?
- I don't know, I was fucking

01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:23.520
hit over the head. I
don't remember shit.

01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:27.167
- Can you please untie me?
- Where is your cell phone?

01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:29.252
I don't, I don't fucking know.

01:08:29.276 --> 01:08:31.737
- Fuck.
- I went looking for Suzy,

01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:34.781
and Michelle, I was tied up,
and a gas mask was put on me.

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:38.803
- Did you see the other person?
- No, apparently it's a fucking

01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:41.412
- thing around here.
- Sean, stop.

01:08:42.413 --> 01:08:43.874
- What?
- What are you thinking?

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:45.334
Can we trust him?

01:08:50.255 --> 01:08:53.050
The only thing we know, is
that somebody in a gas mask,

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:56.428
is killing everybody, and
he is the only one left.

01:08:57.136 --> 01:08:58.138
What?

01:09:01.225 --> 01:09:02.768
What do you mean I'm
the only one left?

01:09:04.228 --> 01:09:06.479
Look, OK, OK, OK,
OK, listen slowly.

01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:11.085
The guy in the gas mask, right?
I saw him leave

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.194
through this exit.

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:16.907
I saw him coming down that
building, a few times.

01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:30.587
I believe him.

01:09:37.553 --> 01:09:40.013
I'll fucking kill you,
if you are lying.

01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:42.890
- Stand up.
- No, I want to stay.

01:09:46.228 --> 01:09:47.229
Oh my god.

01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:01.118
Oh, shit.

01:10:03.495 --> 01:10:04.496
Come on.

01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:16.175
We have to get in there.

01:10:16.925 --> 01:10:19.011
Fuck that, let's
get out of here.

01:10:19.178 --> 01:10:20.803
- There's no way out.
- Then let's hide,

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:23.931
or call for help, but I am not
going into that building.

01:10:23.932 --> 01:10:26.852
- Your phone might be in there.
- Fuck me.

01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:29.354
OK, what do we do?

01:10:32.024 --> 01:10:33.025
Stick together.

01:10:36.278 --> 01:10:37.654
That's not a fucking answer.

01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:51.084
- Shit.
- Sean.

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:53.962
- What do you see?
- What is it is someone in there?

01:10:54.296 --> 01:10:56.882
No, I don't think so,
I don't see anybody.

01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:59.009
But somebody's definitely
been through here.

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:02.596
Oh shit.

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:05.933
- That's Meth.
- What?

01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:09.913
This, is a fucking Meth lab.

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.146
How do you know?

01:11:11.605 --> 01:11:14.565
Are you serious? All you
need is an old dude,

01:11:14.566 --> 01:11:17.295
in his underwear, and a few
Emmy's, and this is the set

01:11:17.319 --> 01:11:18.529
of Breaking Bad.

01:11:24.535 --> 01:11:25.536
We have to get in there.

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.121
This totally makes sense.

01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:32.101
Abandoned kitchen, this
place wreaks of crack dens,

01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:33.585
- and crack heads.
- Dan.

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.879
- Crack heads.
- Look.

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:38.882
- Is that your phone?
- Oh, shit.

01:11:41.093 --> 01:11:44.012
Shit, shit, shit.

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.213
Oh, shit.

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:24.303
- Do you see it?
- It's gone.

01:12:24.636 --> 01:12:29.808
Who cares, there's Meth!
Papa loves some Crystal.

01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:40.068
Go!

01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:44.198
Through the gate, run!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:49.494
No, Sean!

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.663
Come on, Sean, you
have to get back.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.498
You have to get the axe now!

01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:55.834
- Go, now!
- Go, now!

01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:23.862
Sean!

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:27.449
Hurry!

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:32.787
- Where'd he go?
- We could just wait here,

01:13:32.788 --> 01:13:34.998
because we know where he is,
and he can't get inside.

01:13:35.123 --> 01:13:36.208
But then what?

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.335
- Then we wait for help.
- Help?

01:13:38.836 --> 01:13:41.117
How long do you think this Meth
lab has been here, Rachel?

01:13:41.141 --> 01:13:42.226
Nobody's coming.

01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:44.897
Nobody's been here for
a really long time.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.861
Well somebody has to
notice we're missing.

01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:47.886
Why would they look here?

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:50.097
No.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.307
We got to draw him out.

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:54.370
He's got Dan's cellphone
on him, right?

01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:58.397
- So we draw him in here-
- Then what, we kill him?

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:01.554
Let's go find this motherfucker.

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.051
Help!

01:14:10.075 --> 01:14:12.804
- We need help!
- A crackhead is trying

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:14.872
- to kill us!
- Help please!

01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:18.333
- Hello! An evil
crackhead, hello!

01:14:29.094 --> 01:14:30.095
Fuck.

01:14:37.311 --> 01:14:39.479
Dan, Dan the phone.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:44.276
Oh shit. Oh fuck.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:50.800
Hi, hello, I'm at the Holmesburg
Prison, with two people,

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:51.909
and a dead crackhead.

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:54.578
And a whole bunch of
other dead people.

01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:56.385
Just give me the phone,
give me the phone.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:15:00.042
Hello? Oh my god,
thank you, thank you.

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:03.002
- What the fuck was that?
- I'm sorry this night has been

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:05.203
- very traumatic for me.
- Yes, and thank you for making

01:15:05.227 --> 01:15:06.603
it just a little more traumatic.

01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:41.708
Move, move!

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.300
I can't see anything.

01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:53.053
Come on, come on, come on.

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.519
Sean, I can't see anything.

01:16:09.736 --> 01:16:10.988
What the fuck?

01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:18.036
We have to go.

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:34.803
No!

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:08.170
All clear! Team, move!

01:17:08.879 --> 01:17:10.214
Get her out of here.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:14.635
Man down, area secured.

01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:29.608
So,

01:17:31.693 --> 01:17:36.299
you said that there
were one, maybe two men

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.950
in gas masks.

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:42.805
Killers, or, meth heads,

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:45.749
- as you put it.
- Someone is out there.

01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:53.257
- And they killed everyone right?
- Yes.

01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:58.679
But, you admitted that,
your friend, Sean,

01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:00.472
killed someone.

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:03.409
Right? And then he attacked

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:06.270
- a police officer.
- But what about everyone else?

01:18:07.896 --> 01:18:10.023
Let's see, uh.

01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:18.282
Hank, Dan, Brooke,
Suzy, Nick, and uh.

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:21.534
- Cassie, is that right?
- Carrie.

01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:22.911
Yes, sorry, Carrie.

01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:27.725
- We found them.
- And the bodies in the Meth lab.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:28.750
Yeah.

01:18:30.544 --> 01:18:35.007
I'm having a hard time, putting
together a time line here.

01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:39.552
Especially since everyone
in your story, is wearing

01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:42.514
- a gas mask.
- It's not my story.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.977
Can I offer something up here?

01:18:49.354 --> 01:18:50.874
You spent a lot of
time in the kitchen?

01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:52.649
Right, where the chemicals were.

01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:55.962
- Not a lot of time.
- I will not deny there was

01:18:55.986 --> 01:18:57.779
some kind of operation
being run here.

01:18:58.488 --> 01:19:00.341
We suspected that
for a little while.

01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:03.535
You definitely, confirmed
our suspicions.

01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:10.375
But, Methadone, is,

01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:12.503
a hallucinogen.

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:14.880
What do you mean?

01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.443
It means, you hallucinate
when you're on it.

01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:20.487
I know what hallucinogen means.

01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:24.407
You spent a pretty good
amount of time around

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:26.058
this, hallucinogen.

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:28.912
And I don't mean
just in the kitchen.

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:32.063
I mean, all over
this place, really.

01:19:32.064 --> 01:19:34.066
- I could smell it in here.
- So?

01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:39.696
Maybe,

01:19:42.616 --> 01:19:44.326
maybe you were imagining things.

01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:48.556
Imagining things? Does
it look like I was

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.165
imagining things out there?

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.001
- My friends, are dead.
- I know.

01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:56.213
I know.

01:20:01.844 --> 01:20:03.303
But, uh.

01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:07.683
What about the part,
you told me before?

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:11.019
About, the aliens?

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.834
Hank, Hank thought he saw
an alien or something.

01:20:15.858 --> 01:20:18.819
Right, and you said that um...

01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:24.616
When Sean looked at
Hank's camera footage,

01:20:26.827 --> 01:20:30.682
he had a hard time identifying
something on there.

01:20:30.706 --> 01:20:32.833
It was just someone
in a gas mask.

01:20:35.419 --> 01:20:36.920
We're looking at that footage.

01:20:39.339 --> 01:20:40.966
We're going to get to
the bottom of this.

01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:47.723
You also said that,
there was a lot of,

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:52.704
finger pointing going on, right?
Everybody thought that Hank

01:20:52.728 --> 01:20:56.940
was involved, and Hank
was blaming Sean.

01:20:57.774 --> 01:21:00.234
- You didn't trust Dan.
- We didn't know someone else

01:21:00.235 --> 01:21:01.236
was here.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:06.658
There wasn't anyone else here.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:14.458
I am certain, someone
was trying to kill us.

01:21:18.212 --> 01:21:20.005
Just like your
friend, Sean, right?

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.758
He was certain someone was
trying to kill him, too.

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:29.097
Go ahead.

01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:32.058
We got the footage, you
might want to take a look

01:21:32.059 --> 01:21:34.269
- at it.
- Looks like we found our answer.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:36.230
It's not what we thought.

01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:38.482
What just happened?

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:45.322
Stay right there.

01:21:53.372 --> 01:21:54.456
Stay where you are.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.460
Don't move. Stay right there.
