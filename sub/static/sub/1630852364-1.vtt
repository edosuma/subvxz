00:10.724 --> 00:11.689
Each and every one of you

00:11.724 --> 00:12.965
are a part
of the American dream

00:13.000 --> 00:15.862
because you are entrepreneurs
and you own your own business.

00:15.896 --> 00:18.448
And I will tell you, some days
are not so good.

00:18.482 --> 00:19.655
But guess what?

00:19.689 --> 00:22.862
So many days are so amazing.

00:29.275 --> 00:31.206
<i>You're
important to us.</i>

00:31.241 --> 00:35.206
<i>It is the sisterhood,
it is the camaraderie, it is,</i>

00:35.862 --> 00:38.206
it is LuLaRoe.

00:38.241 --> 00:41.689
<i>The law of attraction
rules the universe.</i>

00:41.724 --> 00:43.862
I'm so blessed to be
a part of LuLaRoe.

00:43.896 --> 00:45.586
<i>You are planting seeds.</i>

00:45.620 --> 00:47.379
<i>In the last 30 days,</i>

00:47.413 --> 00:52.137
<i>I sold over $13,000 worth
of LuLaRoe clothing.</i>

00:52.172 --> 00:54.000
That is insane.

00:54.034 --> 00:56.310
<i>We love you,
we value you</i>

00:56.344 --> 00:58.862
<i>in everything that you do.</i>

00:58.896 --> 01:01.103
Together, we're home!

01:01.137 --> 01:03.931
It's given me my purpose back.

01:03.965 --> 01:06.965
<i>I knew that not only
was this special,</i>

01:07.000 --> 01:08.413
<i>but this was something</i>

01:08.448 --> 01:09.896
<i>that was gonna change
people's lives.</i>

01:11.517 --> 01:13.724
<i>You do solemnly state
under penalty of perjury</i>

01:13.758 --> 01:15.586
that the evidence you
shall give in this matter

01:15.620 --> 01:16.862
will be the truth,
the whole truth

01:16.896 --> 01:18.172
and nothing but the truth.

01:18.206 --> 01:20.068
Yes.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.103
Can you please state
your full name?

01:22.137 --> 01:24.586
DeAnne Stidham Brady.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.758
Women are filing
a class-action lawsuit

01:27.793 --> 01:30.758
accusing LuLaRoe of being
a pyramid scheme.

01:30.793 --> 01:33.000
Can you please
state your full legal name?

01:33.620 --> 01:35.931
Mark Allen Stidham.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.620
<i>The lawsuit
seeks a billion dollars
for a plaintiff</i>

01:38.655 --> 01:41.620
<i>unknowingly recruited
into LuLaRoe's pyramid scheme.</i>

01:41.655 --> 01:44.586
I hate that I joined LuLaRoe,
I am embarrassed

01:44.620 --> 01:45.896
that I sold LuLaRoe.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.103
They got my money.

01:48.137 --> 01:49.448
LuLaRoe won.

01:49.482 --> 01:51.448
I actually,

01:51.482 --> 01:54.896
literally despise them,
and it makes me angry.

01:54.931 --> 01:57.586
<i>According to
Washington Attorney General,
Bob Ferguson,</i>

01:57.620 --> 01:59.586
<i>"LuLaRoe tricked consumers
into buying</i>

01:59.620 --> 02:00.827
<i>into its pyramid scheme."</i>

02:00.862 --> 02:04.137
I wasn't alone in...
in receiving merchandise

02:04.172 --> 02:06.275
that I just was not
able to sell

02:06.310 --> 02:08.862
to anyone because it was crap.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.793
I am stuck with thousands
of dollars

02:11.827 --> 02:12.827
of inventory.

02:13.413 --> 02:15.206
Even at my peak month,

02:15.241 --> 02:18.448
I don't think I ever made
any money.

02:18.482 --> 02:20.448
I was in a lot of debt that...

02:22.034 --> 02:23.620
I was unable to pay back.

02:24.413 --> 02:27.379
Disrupting that status quo,

02:27.413 --> 02:29.793
we... we created enemies.

02:29.827 --> 02:33.206
We were attacked viciously
on social media.

02:33.241 --> 02:35.344
Why doesn't LuLaRoe
sell directly to consumers?

02:37.068 --> 02:38.344
I don't know.

02:38.379 --> 02:40.206
How many retailers
does LuLaRoe currently have?

02:40.655 --> 02:41.965
I do not know.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.517
Do you know
a ballpark?
- Nope.

02:44.551 --> 02:46.206
How are you
currently compensated?

02:48.034 --> 02:49.379
I don't know.

02:49.413 --> 02:51.827
When did you start
asking others to sell

02:51.862 --> 02:53.344
LuLaRoe clothing for you?

02:55.793 --> 02:56.862
I never asked anyone.

03:07.724 --> 03:08.931
Be happy.

03:08.965 --> 03:10.793
Give yourself kudos
of the good things

03:10.827 --> 03:12.724
that you are doing
and say to yourself,

03:12.758 --> 03:13.827
"You know what?

03:13.862 --> 03:15.413
I'm able to buy
better groceries.

03:15.448 --> 03:17.379
I am able to make
the car payment."

03:17.413 --> 03:19.758
Those are the reasons
why you got started
at LuLaRoe.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.413
<i>If the pitch was real</i>

03:23.448 --> 03:25.758
and I said to you,
"With no experience,

03:25.793 --> 03:26.931
little money down,

03:26.965 --> 03:28.413
you can run your
own business,

03:28.448 --> 03:29.689
set your own hours,

03:29.724 --> 03:32.034
spend more time
with your friends and family

03:32.068 --> 03:34.482
and possibly
be a millionaire,"

03:34.517 --> 03:35.862
and that is possible,

03:35.896 --> 03:38.034
wouldn't you do it?

03:38.068 --> 03:39.896
I'm super excited
because I just got

03:39.931 --> 03:41.931
my initial inventory today.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.758
It's a welcome card here
from DeAnne and Mark.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.793
This is the planner.

03:49.241 --> 03:50.482
This is so cute.

03:50.517 --> 03:53.034
These are really pretty.

03:53.068 --> 03:54.862
Hello, birds.

03:54.896 --> 03:56.379
Purple birds.

03:56.413 --> 03:59.000
- We have some busy bees.
- Do you like wearing
underpants?

03:59.034 --> 04:00.379
'Cause this is what
it'll feel like.

04:00.413 --> 04:03.517
Also, little extra tuck,
tuck for people like me,

04:03.551 --> 04:04.931
like moms, who need it.

04:04.965 --> 04:07.758
- Stickers. Stickers
- Stickers. Oh, my gosh.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.137
<i>LuLaRoe is a multi-level marketing
company.</i>

04:14.172 --> 04:16.310
They sell shirts, dresses,

04:16.344 --> 04:17.482
all kinds of clothes,

04:17.517 --> 04:20.103
but they're most known
for their leggings.

04:22.034 --> 04:25.034
<i>The leggings cost
around $25.</i>

04:25.068 --> 04:27.310
<i>They have like a slightly
higher price point.</i>

04:27.344 --> 04:30.137
And I think
they were considered
a little more high quality

04:30.172 --> 04:32.827
and a little more designer
than, you know,

04:32.862 --> 04:35.344
just a random
pair of leggings.

04:35.379 --> 04:38.137
<i>People really loved
their really colorful ones</i>

04:38.172 --> 04:40.482
<i>or they loved
the weird patterns.</i>

04:40.517 --> 04:42.068
<i>They loved how soft they were.</i>

04:42.103 --> 04:43.413
<i>And I remember the first time</i>

04:43.448 --> 04:44.758
I heard about LuLaRoe,

04:44.793 --> 04:46.689
that's what people
were talking about,

04:46.724 --> 04:48.896
<i>was these leggings
are so comfortable</i>

04:48.931 --> 04:50.413
<i>and they're so soft.</i>

04:52.586 --> 04:54.172
Buttery soft leggings.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.448
LuLaRoe leggings,

04:55.482 --> 04:56.827
if you haven't tried them,

04:56.862 --> 04:59.310
are one of the most softest,

04:59.344 --> 05:02.482
<i>buttery things you'll ever
put on your legs.</i>

05:02.517 --> 05:06.965
- That buttery soft hand feel
that you all absolutely love.
- Buttery soft.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.758
Like, what does buttery
even mean?

05:09.793 --> 05:12.310
And I thought that was really
ridiculous, too,

05:12.344 --> 05:13.413
until I felt them.

05:17.413 --> 05:18.862
<i>Now, let's go
to a little town</i>

05:18.896 --> 05:21.931
<i>in New Jersey where things
are really popping.</i>

05:21.965 --> 05:25.000
<i>Yes, there's a party going on
at Mrs. Betty Martin's house.</i>

05:25.034 --> 05:26.517
<i>It's a Tupperware party,</i>

05:26.551 --> 05:28.137
<i>and it's really fun.</i>

05:28.172 --> 05:30.310
<i>The girls get together
and meet their old friends</i>

05:30.344 --> 05:31.896
<i>and make some new ones.</i>

05:31.931 --> 05:33.758
<i>Then there's a demonstration</i>

05:33.793 --> 05:35.172
<i>by one of the Tupperware
dealers</i>

05:35.206 --> 05:36.379
<i>who lives in your community.</i>

05:36.413 --> 05:39.758
<i>♪ It's time to take time
out for beauty ♪</i>

05:40.551 --> 05:41.827
<i>Avon calling</i>

05:41.862 --> 05:43.586
<i>Growing up,
I remember my mom</i>

05:43.620 --> 05:45.241
<i>going to a lot of Tupperware
parties.</i>

05:45.275 --> 05:47.172
My great grandma sold Avon.

05:47.206 --> 05:48.379
My aunt sold Mary Kay.

05:49.931 --> 05:51.379
<i>Dishes in my grandma's house</i>

05:51.413 --> 05:53.137
<i>were from like door-to-door
salesmen.</i>

05:54.068 --> 05:55.620
<i>And you would see
a lot of products</i>

05:55.655 --> 05:56.827
<i>in people's houses.</i>

05:56.862 --> 05:59.172
<i>I thought it was just a fun...</i>

06:00.103 --> 06:01.379
<i>...get together?</i>

06:01.413 --> 06:03.379
As a kid, I did not understand

06:03.413 --> 06:05.413
about the recruitment.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.655
<i>Like, I really thought these
women were just, like,</i>

06:07.689 --> 06:08.965
<i>running a business
out of their house.</i>

06:11.862 --> 06:15.896
<i>The American dream
is that we all have</i>

06:15.931 --> 06:19.137
the chance to be rich,

06:19.172 --> 06:21.620
and make it, you know,
we all have the chance.

06:21.655 --> 06:22.896
We all grow up thinking,

06:22.931 --> 06:25.620
"I'm gonna get famous
or I'm gonna get rich."

06:25.655 --> 06:28.620
And we aren't discouraged
from thinking that.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.758
Maybe you'd like to look
at this more closely.

06:31.275 --> 06:32.586
I'll pass it around.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.793
Yeah.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.310
<i>If you work
hard enough,</i>

06:35.344 --> 06:37.827
<i>you will achieve success.</i>

06:39.137 --> 06:40.896
And these companies,

06:40.931 --> 06:42.379
they're just exploiting

06:42.413 --> 06:44.448
that hopefulness that we've
all been raised with.

06:46.931 --> 06:48.724
<i>LuLaRoe was founded in 2013</i>

06:48.758 --> 06:51.896
and grew extremely fast.

06:51.931 --> 06:54.137
<i>So, in 2015,</i>

06:54.172 --> 06:56.793
<i>they only had around
1,000 consultants.</i>

06:56.827 --> 06:58.896
<i>By April 2017,</i>

06:58.931 --> 07:01.517
<i>they had over 80,000
consultants</i>

07:01.551 --> 07:03.724
<i>and were making
a billion dollars in revenue.</i>

07:05.034 --> 07:09.034
So, that's 0 to 80,000
in five years.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.310
You know, having come
from business,

07:10.344 --> 07:11.793
I understand most companies
would kill

07:11.827 --> 07:14.275
to have that kind of growth
year over year.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.724
And so, uh, business processes
have been a challenge.

07:17.758 --> 07:20.034
You know, when it was just
a small family business,

07:20.068 --> 07:22.034
we all just, kind of,
rolled up our sleeves

07:22.068 --> 07:23.482
and did what needed
to be done.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.655
<i>I first got
interested</i>

07:26.689 --> 07:29.310
<i>in reporting
on multi-level marketing</i>

07:29.344 --> 07:31.103
because I had noticed

07:31.137 --> 07:33.931
that a lot of people
that I knew from growing up

07:33.965 --> 07:36.827
on social media had
been joining MLMs.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.689
Hey, girl, hey!

07:38.724 --> 07:40.448
Hey, hey, hey, ladies!

07:40.482 --> 07:43.689
Hey, girl, hey, happy Friday!

07:43.724 --> 07:46.379
<i>The simplest way
to explain an MLM</i>

07:46.413 --> 07:48.689
<i>or a multi-level marketing
company</i>

07:48.724 --> 07:51.793
<i>is that they recruit
individual retailers</i>

07:51.827 --> 07:53.758
<i>to sell a product.</i>

07:53.793 --> 07:55.931
<i>And then those retailers</i>

07:55.965 --> 07:58.620
<i>recruit other retailers.</i>

07:58.655 --> 08:00.379
<i>The products can be anything.</i>

08:00.413 --> 08:02.689
<i>It can be essential oils,</i>

08:02.724 --> 08:04.448
<i>it can be herbal supplements,</i>

08:04.482 --> 08:05.931
<i>it can be make-up</i>

08:06.551 --> 08:07.689
<i>or it can be leggings.</i>

08:11.068 --> 08:12.482
<i>LuLaRoe is the kind of MLM,</i>

08:12.517 --> 08:13.620
<i>they have a product,</i>

08:14.310 --> 08:15.724
<i>banana leggings,</i>

08:15.758 --> 08:19.241
<i>and they're superior
to other banana leggings.</i>

08:19.275 --> 08:22.448
<i>They're so superior
that you must sell them</i>

08:22.482 --> 08:24.172
<i>door-to-door or to your
friends and family</i>

08:24.206 --> 08:25.241
<i>or on a Facebook Live.</i>

08:25.275 --> 08:28.000
<i>And that's how exclusive
this opportunity is.</i>

08:28.413 --> 08:29.931
<i>And the way</i>

08:29.965 --> 08:32.275
<i>the companies describe
how that works</i>

08:32.310 --> 08:34.241
is you buy in,

08:34.275 --> 08:36.068
you get a bunch of banana
leggings,

08:36.103 --> 08:37.724
you sell a bunch of banana
leggings.

08:37.758 --> 08:39.103
All of your friends
at that party

08:39.137 --> 08:40.758
that were buying
the banana leggings are like,

08:40.793 --> 08:43.034
"Wow, this is an amazing
business opportunity."

08:43.068 --> 08:44.413
And you're like, "I know.

08:44.448 --> 08:46.275
Would you like to sign up
underneath me?"

08:46.310 --> 08:47.793
So, you sign people up
underneath you,

08:47.827 --> 08:50.000
<i>and there's one rung
of people below you.</i>

08:50.034 --> 08:51.034
<i>That's your downline.</i>

08:52.862 --> 08:54.000
<i>Now, you're an upline.</i>

08:55.448 --> 08:57.689
<i>And you get a slice of every
future purchase</i>

08:57.724 --> 08:58.862
<i>that they make.</i>

08:58.896 --> 09:00.724
<i>So, it behooves an upline</i>

09:00.758 --> 09:03.758
<i>to encourage their downline
to stock up.</i>

09:07.517 --> 09:10.000
<i>The sales pitch
from the MLM company</i>

09:10.034 --> 09:13.172
<i>is that, that is supposed
to continue on,</i>

09:13.206 --> 09:14.344
kind of like a chain letter,

09:14.379 --> 09:16.344
where you've got
your people under you.

09:16.379 --> 09:18.000
Say you have ten, you know,

09:18.034 --> 09:21.000
half of them are amazing
recruiters, they each get ten.

09:21.034 --> 09:23.310
<i>Oh, my gosh, now you have,
like, 60 people</i>

09:23.344 --> 09:25.241
<i>that you're getting
a slice of.</i>

09:27.034 --> 09:28.551
<i>Then those people are also
supposed to be</i>

09:28.586 --> 09:29.724
<i>just as ambitious.</i>

09:33.965 --> 09:35.344
It's been a while
since we've shopped,

09:35.379 --> 09:37.793
so I want to show you guys
what is new.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.241
Do you have the daisies
in the medium?

09:39.275 --> 09:40.413
I don't.

09:40.448 --> 09:42.068
Here's another extra small.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.068
It has cute little, uh,
typewriters

09:44.103 --> 09:45.413
with little sweet notes on it.

09:45.448 --> 09:47.517
I think that the Internet

09:47.551 --> 09:50.344
helped people who pitch MLMs
as an opportunity,

09:50.379 --> 09:51.862
as a business opportunity.

09:51.896 --> 09:55.413
I think it helped them
over an early hurdle,

09:55.448 --> 09:58.724
which is, who am I
gonna recruit.

09:58.758 --> 10:00.413
Social media has been

10:00.448 --> 10:03.172
like gasoline on the fire
of MLMs.

10:03.206 --> 10:05.758
I am so beyond excited,

10:05.793 --> 10:07.413
I'm about to spontaneously
combust.

10:07.448 --> 10:08.620
I don't know what you get,

10:08.655 --> 10:10.000
I don't know what I'm
gonna give away,

10:10.034 --> 10:11.310
but it's gonna be something
good.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.344
<i>Instead of just
having a party at your house,</i>

10:14.379 --> 10:16.413
<i>where you can invite people
who could physically
get there,</i>

10:16.448 --> 10:18.448
you can have an online party

10:18.482 --> 10:20.931
where you can invite everyone
you know,

10:20.965 --> 10:22.586
plus invite them to invite
everyone they know.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.241
And, you know, you can get
these Facebook groups

10:24.275 --> 10:26.137
that have like 30,000 people
in them.

10:26.172 --> 10:28.000
So if you're thinking
about doing it,

10:28.034 --> 10:29.172
I would encourage you to do it

10:29.206 --> 10:30.793
'cause it's been such
a blessing.

10:30.827 --> 10:33.793
<i>So it just makes
it even easier</i>

10:33.827 --> 10:35.344
<i>to recruit people.</i>

10:35.379 --> 10:38.137
If you are interested
in all of the opportunity,

10:38.172 --> 10:40.310
please feel free to reach out
with me.

10:40.344 --> 10:41.862
<i>"Let me ask
you a question.</i>

10:41.896 --> 10:45.551
Have you ever thought
about potentially working
on a side hustle?

10:45.586 --> 10:46.931
You're such a badass.

10:46.965 --> 10:49.000
I think you would be amazing
at this opportunity

10:49.034 --> 10:50.827
I recently got involved with.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.172
I know this sounds crazy,

10:52.206 --> 10:54.137
but I've made a little bit
of side cash.

10:54.172 --> 10:56.137
Let me tell you more about it.
Lol.

10:56.172 --> 10:58.482
Here's my number, call me soon
or text me, 'kay?"

11:00.172 --> 11:02.517
Oh, my gosh, guys,
I got rained on so bad.

11:02.551 --> 11:05.241
I was delivering LuLaRoe,
like all day.

11:05.275 --> 11:07.000
<i>I think LuLaRoe
is kind of an example</i>

11:07.034 --> 11:10.655
of like the American
work ethos on steroids.

11:10.689 --> 11:13.689
Sometimes, you feel like,
"I only have this much

11:13.724 --> 11:15.482
and I'm strung out.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.655
I cannot do it anymore."

11:17.689 --> 11:19.172
Get out there, get busy,

11:19.206 --> 11:22.034
enjoy, have fun
and serve your customers.

11:22.068 --> 11:23.137
Serve your community.

11:26.344 --> 11:27.517
<i>DeAnne and Mark Stidham</i>

11:27.551 --> 11:29.034
<i>are the founders of LuLaRoe.</i>

11:30.724 --> 11:32.862
So DeAnne is Mormon

11:32.896 --> 11:35.034
<i>and she was raised
in a Mormon family</i>

11:35.068 --> 11:37.517
<i>that's basically
Mormon royalty.</i>

11:40.000 --> 11:42.758
<i>DeAnne's descended
from the brother</i>

11:42.793 --> 11:45.137
<i>of the man who founded
the Mormon church.</i>

11:46.620 --> 11:48.551
<i>Because of that relationship</i>

11:48.586 --> 11:50.172
<i>to the founding of the church,</i>

11:50.206 --> 11:53.482
<i>there would have been
a sense of exceptionalism</i>

11:53.517 --> 11:55.000
<i>within the family.</i>

11:55.034 --> 11:57.241
There is a huge amount
of overlap

11:57.275 --> 12:00.310
between Mormons
and the MLM community.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.862
<i>Mormons are born
and bred missionaries,</i>

12:02.896 --> 12:05.068
<i>and that skillset</i>

12:05.103 --> 12:07.034
<i>becomes really useful</i>

12:07.068 --> 12:09.758
<i>when you're trying to get
people to join</i>

12:09.793 --> 12:12.206
this once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

12:17.172 --> 12:20.241
I grew up in the same, uh,
Mormon circles

12:20.275 --> 12:21.965
as DeAnne.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.413
<i>Like, I remember her presence,</i>

12:23.448 --> 12:26.068
<i>I remember how her perfume
and makeup</i>

12:26.103 --> 12:27.551
<i>and hairspray smelled.</i>

12:28.241 --> 12:30.896
She was incredibly outgoing.

12:30.931 --> 12:32.379
<i>There are some people
that just always seem</i>

12:32.413 --> 12:33.931
<i>like they're selling
something.</i>

12:33.965 --> 12:35.862
And they're always trying

12:35.896 --> 12:38.586
to convert you to something,
right?

12:38.620 --> 12:40.413
And as a child,

12:40.448 --> 12:42.620
<i>I sensed that about her.</i>

12:42.655 --> 12:46.275
And I will tell you,
even if you're selling
ten items a day,

12:46.310 --> 12:47.551
you're making a difference.

12:47.586 --> 12:49.931
You decided that you could

12:49.965 --> 12:53.137
the minute you said,
"I'm gonna do LuLaRoe."

12:53.172 --> 12:55.241
<i>I think the cult
of personality around DeAnne</i>

12:55.275 --> 12:56.758
<i>probably helped
a lot in the beginning.</i>

12:57.310 --> 12:59.206
<i>She is very flashy,</i>

12:59.241 --> 13:01.275
<i>lots of jewelry,
lots of makeup.</i>

13:01.310 --> 13:03.448
She cannot stay off
of her phone

13:03.482 --> 13:05.000
<i>and posting pictures
of herself</i>

13:05.034 --> 13:06.379
<i>and doing live videos</i>

13:06.413 --> 13:07.827
<i>and being on Instagram Live,</i>

13:07.862 --> 13:09.655
and it's mesmerizing.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.344
Hey, everybody.
I am so excited.

13:12.379 --> 13:14.620
It is enthusiastic Thursday.

13:14.655 --> 13:17.103
I am in love with this hat.

13:19.586 --> 13:22.655
<i>The origin story
of DeAnne's business,</i>

13:22.689 --> 13:25.827
it's attractive
to a lot of new recruits.

13:25.862 --> 13:28.448
<i>I had one kid
on a hip and I was pregnant,</i>

13:28.482 --> 13:30.482
and a couple of kids
in the stroller.

13:31.172 --> 13:33.034
<i>DeAnne has this very</i>

13:33.068 --> 13:35.517
<i>humble and inspiring
origin story</i>

13:35.551 --> 13:37.862
<i>that she is sure
to repeat all the time.</i>

13:37.896 --> 13:40.482
How she started
as this single mother

13:40.517 --> 13:44.034
who was selling maxi skirts
out of the trunk of her car.

13:44.068 --> 13:45.586
<i>And I said,
"I'm coming.</i>

13:45.620 --> 13:47.034
<i>Invite all your friends</i>

13:47.068 --> 13:49.275
<i>and we're gonna have
a maxi skirt party,"</i>

13:49.310 --> 13:51.103
and they go, "Okay,
count me in, DeAnne."

13:51.137 --> 13:52.965
And no matter how many I did,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.965
uh, I just kept booking
more and more.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.344
<i>And we started
a conversation about,</i>

13:57.379 --> 14:00.206
<i>"Don't you think there's
probably other women</i>

14:00.241 --> 14:03.517
that would want the same
opportunity you've had

14:03.551 --> 14:06.379
to earn extra money
while still having the freedom

14:06.413 --> 14:08.724
around their schedule,
to be a stay-at-home mom

14:08.758 --> 14:10.620
or take care of their kids?"

14:10.655 --> 14:12.379
<i>The house parties
were making a lot of money</i>

14:12.413 --> 14:14.517
<i>and the skirts
were very popular.</i>

14:14.551 --> 14:17.241
And soon other women,
like Brittany Hunter,

14:17.275 --> 14:19.172
who was the first retailer
for LuLaRoe,

14:19.620 --> 14:21.724
um, wanted in.

14:21.758 --> 14:23.827
They wanted to know how
they could sell the skirts.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.275
I'm the first retailer
of LuLaRoe,

14:26.310 --> 14:28.068
but technically it wasn't
called LuLaRoe

14:28.103 --> 14:30.034
in the beginning,
so it's been nine years.

14:30.586 --> 14:32.379
And it was, um,

14:32.413 --> 14:34.068
August of 2012,
I'm pretty sure,

14:34.103 --> 14:36.413
when I had my very first
maxi skirt party with DeAnne

14:37.137 --> 14:38.931
<i>and loved it.</i>

14:38.965 --> 14:41.379
<i>Absolutely fell in love
with people coming to my house</i>

14:41.413 --> 14:43.896
<i>and the camaraderie
and the excitement.</i>

14:43.931 --> 14:45.758
<i>I called her the next day,
I'm like, "I wanna do this.</i>

14:45.793 --> 14:47.517
<i>I need more skirts.
How do I get more skirts?"</i>

14:48.655 --> 14:51.000
<i>It was her and I just
selling maxi skirts,</i>

14:51.034 --> 14:52.551
and she was still doing
her parties

14:52.586 --> 14:54.689
and I would do some
around southern Utah.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.896
And, yeah,
that's kind of where it began.

14:58.655 --> 14:59.931
<i>So, it works very well</i>

14:59.965 --> 15:03.068
<i>that as a part
of DeAnne's origin story,</i>

15:03.103 --> 15:05.517
this business
to recruit other people

15:05.551 --> 15:08.413
or get other women involved
wasn't even her idea.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.586
It just fell upon her.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.482
<i>It's this American dream saga.</i>

15:13.517 --> 15:16.137
<i>She was just like you.
She wasn't special.</i>

15:16.172 --> 15:19.965
She wasn't rich.
She wasn't #blessed.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.827
She just worked really hard.

15:21.862 --> 15:24.689
She was your, you know,
your average suburban
wife and mother,

15:24.724 --> 15:26.965
and look at everything
she accomplished.

15:35.103 --> 15:38.965
But the story of Mark
and DeAnne and LuLaRoe,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.310
it's not really about them.

15:40.344 --> 15:42.551
It's really about
the thousands

15:42.586 --> 15:45.068
upon thousands of women

15:45.103 --> 15:48.827
<i>who fell prey to the promises
of feeling worthy</i>

15:48.862 --> 15:50.965
<i>and being a part
of something bigger</i>

15:51.000 --> 15:53.620
<i>and having impact
and the sisterhood</i>

15:54.551 --> 15:57.000
and are now telling
their story.

16:09.896 --> 16:12.931
<i>Before I started
LuLaRoe in 2016,</i>

16:13.551 --> 16:14.827
I just felt kind of lost,

16:14.862 --> 16:16.448
and I feel like
when I found LuLaRoe,

16:16.482 --> 16:19.586
I'm like, "This is clicking,
like, finally,

16:19.620 --> 16:21.931
this is something
that I can do."

16:30.206 --> 16:32.551
<i>I actually went down
to a convention</i>

16:32.586 --> 16:34.413
<i>in Corona, California,</i>

16:34.448 --> 16:37.413
<i>and there were so many
retailers from across
the country coming.</i>

16:37.448 --> 16:39.172
I was like,
"Wow, this is awesome.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.586
I'm part
of this big movement."

16:41.620 --> 16:43.793
<i>DeAnne spoke
at that convention,</i>

16:43.827 --> 16:46.310
and I was eating up
every word she was saying.

16:46.344 --> 16:49.137
I think I even got teary-eyed,
like, listening to her story.

16:49.172 --> 16:50.724
<i>You know,
when she was explaining</i>

16:50.758 --> 16:52.482
<i>her struggles before starting,</i>

16:53.172 --> 16:54.965
I kind of related to that.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.793
And, like, that's how
I got emotional too,

16:56.827 --> 16:59.482
because I felt like I wasn't
where I was supposed to be,

17:00.448 --> 17:02.379
until I found LuLaRoe.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.172
And I just...
that really spoke to me.

17:06.413 --> 17:07.965
This is LuLaRoe.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.862
I have so much stuff. Sorry.

17:11.275 --> 17:12.724
Oh, here we go.

17:12.758 --> 17:15.034
This one has
the LuLaRoe logo in it.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.000
Oh, and I have
matching leggings to this,

17:17.034 --> 17:19.137
so you literally have a...
it's called a Lula outfit.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.034
<i>I knew it cost a lot to join,</i>

17:24.068 --> 17:29.034
<i>so I went to my mom
and I asked her,</i>

17:29.068 --> 17:32.379
<i>"Is there any way
that I could borrow $10,000?"</i>

17:32.413 --> 17:34.517
<i>She was very skeptical
at first,</i>

17:34.551 --> 17:36.000
<i>but when I was explaining it
to her,</i>

17:36.034 --> 17:37.827
<i>I like, kind of
broke down in tears</i>

17:37.862 --> 17:40.310
<i>because I just felt
so passionate about it.</i>

17:40.344 --> 17:41.896
And she agreed

17:41.931 --> 17:45.448
and she agreed to take money
from her 401to help me.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.000
Hi, guys, Jill here.

17:47.034 --> 17:49.758
Um, I'm kind of testingsomething a little bit different today.

17:49.793 --> 17:52.413
I'm going to be doing $5
off each Julia

17:52.448 --> 17:54.034
and free shipping.

17:54.068 --> 17:57.482
<i>I had been hyping it up
on Facebook, social media,</i>

17:57.517 --> 18:01.034
and so I had friends
from high school and college
come and shop,

18:01.068 --> 18:03.068
and that helped
push that first month

18:03.103 --> 18:04.793
to $10,000 in sales.

18:04.827 --> 18:06.137
So, up next, you guys, I have

18:06.172 --> 18:09.068
an extra-large green Carly.

18:09.103 --> 18:12.413
This is legging soft material.
It's a green heather.

18:12.448 --> 18:15.724
<i>I felt like
LuLaRoe's message
was "Everybody is beautiful."</i>

18:15.758 --> 18:18.655
Our size ranges
would go up to a size 18-20,

18:18.689 --> 18:21.310
so I feel like
it was really size-inclusive.

18:21.344 --> 18:23.965
And I felt like
that drew a lot of women in.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.137
Carlies do run
two to three sizes big.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.310
So, this looks really cute
with it knotted up, you know?

18:29.344 --> 18:31.241
It was really cool.
It was so exciting.

18:31.275 --> 18:33.379
My customers loved
the outfits I put together.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.103
<i>My second month,
I went to $15,000,</i>

18:36.137 --> 18:37.896
and I was just blown away

18:37.931 --> 18:41.034
about, like, how much money
I could get by doing this.

18:41.068 --> 18:42.655
So, these are medium

18:42.689 --> 18:45.586
and it is dipped
with striped, stripes.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.620
Super, super cute.

18:47.275 --> 18:48.551
It was a whirlwind,

18:48.586 --> 18:51.137
and our first month,
we sold $21,000.

18:51.896 --> 18:54.275
And then it just grew so fast.

18:54.310 --> 18:55.379
Take my challenge.

18:55.413 --> 18:58.137
Get out there
and find five people a day.

18:58.172 --> 19:00.068
Go out and talk to them.

19:00.103 --> 19:03.655
I listen to DeAnne every day,
you know, on Instagram,

19:03.689 --> 19:06.344
and it really gave me
a huge boost in confidence.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.517
And your goal
is to develop a relationship

19:09.551 --> 19:11.965
with those people that you
come in contact with, okay?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.172
That was another aspect of
what was recruiting.

19:14.206 --> 19:16.206
I had girls
who signed up under me.

19:16.241 --> 19:17.965
I was able
to build a team of ten

19:18.000 --> 19:19.379
to become the rank of trainer.

19:19.413 --> 19:20.551
When you became a trainer,

19:20.586 --> 19:23.137
that's when you got
the gold watch.

19:23.172 --> 19:25.310
<i>I couldn't wait to get
that gold watch.</i>

19:25.344 --> 19:27.103
It was a goal
I strived for,

19:27.137 --> 19:29.034
like, "I have to earn
that watch."

19:29.068 --> 19:32.000
Like, "I will do anything
to earn this watch."

19:32.034 --> 19:34.724
<i>I hit trainer. I mean,
that's where the money was at.</i>

19:34.758 --> 19:36.620
And then you didn't have
to stress on your sales.

19:36.655 --> 19:38.724
And then we have this beauty.

19:38.758 --> 19:41.000
<i>So you start out
just as a retailer,</i>

19:41.034 --> 19:43.137
which means that you're just
selling for yourself

19:43.172 --> 19:44.655
and you're getting
your own sales.

19:44.689 --> 19:46.034
<i>Then you can move on
to sponsor,</i>

19:46.068 --> 19:48.275
<i>which means you have
people under you.</i>

19:48.310 --> 19:51.275
<i>And then after that,
it goes trainer,</i>

19:51.310 --> 19:53.793
<i>coach, mentor, ambassador.</i>

19:53.827 --> 19:55.862
<i>And so basically,
all that really means is</i>

19:55.896 --> 19:57.689
<i>you just have more
and more people under you.</i>

19:57.724 --> 19:59.689
<i>Since the early MLMs,</i>

19:59.724 --> 20:02.172
<i>one of the exercises
you do at the beginning</i>

20:02.206 --> 20:04.448
<i>is writing down 10 or 50...</i>

20:04.482 --> 20:06.344
I think LuLaRoe does 50 names,

20:06.379 --> 20:08.310
um, that you're supposed
to write down of people

20:08.344 --> 20:10.103
you could possibly recruit.

20:10.137 --> 20:12.482
<i>In church communities,
Mormonism</i>

20:12.517 --> 20:14.862
<i>especially, those networks,</i>

20:14.896 --> 20:17.379
it doesn't take
any time at all

20:17.413 --> 20:18.793
to think of those 50 names.

20:19.862 --> 20:22.620
<i>And so DeAnne
was able to tap</i>

20:22.655 --> 20:26.689
<i>into this preexisting
Mormon network</i>

20:26.724 --> 20:29.689
<i>so that she could not
sell leggings</i>

20:29.724 --> 20:33.862
but sell um... like, hope.

20:37.137 --> 20:38.689
<i>LuLaRoe's
marketing strategy</i>

20:38.724 --> 20:41.068
was very family-oriented,

20:41.103 --> 20:43.448
like so we could help mothers
support their children.

20:43.482 --> 20:45.862
<i>We have people
starting right now,</i>

20:45.896 --> 20:47.862
<i>who are doing incredible
things for their family.</i>

20:47.896 --> 20:50.482
<i>She wanted to be
a stay-at-home mom,</i>

20:50.517 --> 20:52.034
<i>but has the freedom
to come and go</i>

20:52.068 --> 20:53.206
<i>and do what she wanted to do.</i>

20:54.344 --> 20:58.034
How many women
would like an opportunity

20:58.068 --> 21:01.379
to earn income
while staying at home?

21:01.413 --> 21:05.241
I had title after title, mom,
sister, daughter, girlfriend,

21:05.275 --> 21:06.689
but I hadn't figured out

21:06.724 --> 21:10.000
what my individual
purpose was.

21:10.034 --> 21:12.758
The idea of, um,

21:12.793 --> 21:14.413
you know, making money
from home

21:14.448 --> 21:17.551
with two small children
was ideal.

21:17.586 --> 21:19.068
I was used to making money.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.517
I was used to contributing

21:20.551 --> 21:22.724
to the household bills
and everything,

21:22.758 --> 21:25.689
um, and I wanted that answer
to staying at home

21:25.724 --> 21:28.379
and still being able
to raise my daughter.

21:28.413 --> 21:32.413
So, um, you know, I heard
the term "Moms Losing Money".

21:32.448 --> 21:36.724
That's what MLM stands for,
is Moms Losing Money.

21:36.758 --> 21:40.172
Um, and so it's not something
that appealed to me

21:40.206 --> 21:43.689
because it...
it didn't make sense to me.

21:43.724 --> 21:45.448
It didn't make sense or cents.

21:45.482 --> 21:47.275
We started this business
on the premise

21:47.310 --> 21:49.758
that you could make full-time
income on a part-time...

21:49.793 --> 21:50.931
part-time work.

21:50.965 --> 21:53.724
Yes, full-time pay
for part-time work.

21:54.206 --> 21:55.931
It's... that's...

21:55.965 --> 21:58.931
If that doesn't define an MLM,
I don't know what does,

21:58.965 --> 22:03.310
because as
a "real" entrepreneur,

22:03.344 --> 22:05.827
full-time pay, full-time work,

22:05.862 --> 22:09.793
24/7, 365,
losing sleep, losing money.

22:09.827 --> 22:12.000
That is the entrepreneur life.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.620
<i>I always say that besides
being an entrepreneur,</i>

22:17.655 --> 22:20.482
<i>being a mother
is one of the loneliest things
you can do.</i>

22:20.517 --> 22:22.620
<i>It costs more to keep
your kids in daycare</i>

22:22.655 --> 22:23.827
<i>than it is for you to work</i>

22:23.862 --> 22:25.620
<i>and then, you know,
pay for that.</i>

22:25.655 --> 22:27.758
So, it makes sense
for a lot of women

22:27.793 --> 22:29.275
to stay home
and take care of their kids

22:29.310 --> 22:31.137
and they... but they want
to feel productive, right?

22:31.172 --> 22:32.689
They miss
their nine-to-five life.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.689
They miss... you know,
once you become a mom,

22:34.724 --> 22:36.275
it's a different
group of friends.

22:36.310 --> 22:39.862
So, you miss that community,
a sense of community.

22:39.896 --> 22:44.000
<i>And so when you see
other moms being boss babes,</i>

22:44.034 --> 22:46.000
<i>that's something
that you want.</i>

22:53.379 --> 22:54.896
<i>Whatever I do in life,</i>

22:54.931 --> 22:57.068
<i>I want to be
the very best I can be.</i>

22:57.103 --> 22:58.689
<i>So, if I'm a LuLaRoe retailer,</i>

22:58.724 --> 23:00.379
<i>I wanna be
the best one I can be.</i>

23:01.275 --> 23:03.586
If I have kids,
I'm gonna have 11.

23:04.275 --> 23:05.689
<i>Girls, bring him down.</i>

23:05.724 --> 23:08.724
I'm bringing him down,
see, he's pulling me.

23:12.068 --> 23:15.068
Whoa. Slow down, baby.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.379
<i>It's pure craziness.</i>

23:17.551 --> 23:19.000
<i>So, we're Christians,</i>

23:19.034 --> 23:20.310
<i>we're members
of the Church of Christ.</i>

23:21.172 --> 23:22.586
<i>We had four kids,</i>

23:22.620 --> 23:24.172
<i>but then
we went on a mission trip</i>

23:24.896 --> 23:26.379
<i>and we stayed in an orphanage.</i>

23:27.344 --> 23:28.517
<i>I'm a stay-at-home mom</i>

23:28.551 --> 23:30.137
and Kenny had
a really good job,

23:30.172 --> 23:31.413
so why not adopt?

23:33.103 --> 23:34.689
That's how 11 happens.

23:34.724 --> 23:36.000
So...

23:37.241 --> 23:38.689
<i>I would say
that our generation</i>

23:38.724 --> 23:40.413
<i>is just a bunch of strong</i>

23:40.448 --> 23:42.034
<i>stay-at-home moms</i>

23:42.068 --> 23:44.551
<i>and a lot of us joined
LuLaRoe</i>

23:44.586 --> 23:46.310
<i>and that's what grew LuLaRoe.</i>

23:46.344 --> 23:48.827
It was who signed up,
saw the business opportunity

23:50.206 --> 23:51.310
<i>and ran with it.</i>

23:52.172 --> 23:53.344
It's like a cool mom club.

23:56.931 --> 23:58.620
<i>When I started,
we didn't go live,</i>

23:58.655 --> 24:01.034
<i>we just did in home pop-ups.</i>

24:01.068 --> 24:03.827
<i>It was just girls shopping.
Just like a big party.</i>

24:04.413 --> 24:05.827
<i>A lot of fun.</i>

24:05.862 --> 24:07.689
<i>This is nice.
Is this the back or the front?</i>

24:07.724 --> 24:08.793
It's reversible.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.551
I like options.

24:12.068 --> 24:14.241
Wendi, Wendi.

24:14.275 --> 24:15.965
<i>I have
some of the best friends</i>

24:16.000 --> 24:17.620
<i>from that because</i>

24:17.655 --> 24:20.275
<i>I feel like, even though
LuLaRoe pushed community,</i>

24:20.310 --> 24:22.586
we had then to create
true community

24:22.620 --> 24:24.206
to make it work.

24:24.241 --> 24:25.931
I know, Tracy,
the Shirleys are on point

24:25.965 --> 24:27.448
and I have a new box
coming tomorrow.

24:27.482 --> 24:29.517
It's going to be good.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.034
Your desire to succeed.

24:31.068 --> 24:34.551
Your commitment
to your, to your goals

24:34.586 --> 24:37.724
and your commitment
to not letting yourself down

24:37.758 --> 24:39.620
<i>will make
all of the difference.</i>

24:39.655 --> 24:41.206
<i>Remember, your business</i>

24:41.241 --> 24:42.896
<i>is not going to grow
without you.</i>

24:42.931 --> 24:44.931
Now, we also want you

24:44.965 --> 24:47.137
to strive
for getting on the cruise.

24:48.827 --> 24:51.068
<i>It was a goal
to cruise qualify.</i>

24:51.103 --> 24:52.724
<i>There was
three different tiers,</i>

24:52.758 --> 24:53.862
and so of course, I wanted

24:53.896 --> 24:55.068
the highest ranking tier.

24:55.103 --> 24:57.827
That meant you got
a better room in the cruise.

24:57.862 --> 24:59.827
<i>The cruise was actually
something you qualified for</i>

24:59.862 --> 25:03.551
if you sold $12,000
for six months in a row.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.137
You are that person that gets

25:07.172 --> 25:11.103
and deserves anything
that you choose for it to be.

25:11.137 --> 25:13.724
<i>Go, go, go.
Prizes, cruises.</i>

25:13.758 --> 25:16.896
<i>I just really, really
enjoy working for that.</i>

25:17.862 --> 25:19.068
For something.

25:19.103 --> 25:21.206
Because then it doesn't seem
like a job, then it was fun.

25:23.103 --> 25:25.517
<i>LuLaRoe cruise ship,
all LuLaRoe people.</i>

25:25.551 --> 25:27.000
And if you've been to any
LuLaRoe event,

25:27.034 --> 25:28.827
you know at LuLaRoe
everything's a party

25:28.862 --> 25:30.310
- and super fun.
- Yes, it's not the same.

25:31.310 --> 25:32.896
<i>You never wanna
miss a cruise.</i>

25:34.034 --> 25:36.620
And we can't wait to see you
on the next cruise.

25:36.655 --> 25:38.172
We are so excited.

25:59.827 --> 26:02.724
<i>I'm always
trying to find things
on the Internet</i>

26:02.758 --> 26:04.517
<i>that will resonate
with people.</i>

26:04.551 --> 26:06.551
So I cover influencers,

26:06.586 --> 26:08.275
things going viral
on the Internet.

26:09.482 --> 26:11.965
<i>So, LuLaRoe in their heyday,</i>

26:12.000 --> 26:14.103
they had these cruises

26:14.137 --> 26:17.827
that were like candy
for social media,

26:17.862 --> 26:19.965
<i>like, if you follow
all of the top sellers</i>

26:20.000 --> 26:21.275
<i>of LuLaRoe on Instagram</i>

26:21.310 --> 26:23.172
<i>and they're all on this cruise
at the same time,</i>

26:23.206 --> 26:26.103
<i>and they're posting
#BecauseOfLuLaRoe,</i>

26:26.137 --> 26:28.137
"I'm having a pina colada
on the beach,

26:28.172 --> 26:29.206
and I'm in the Caribbean

26:29.241 --> 26:30.655
and I'm doing this
and I'm doing that."

26:30.689 --> 26:33.379
And it's like, "Duh,
of course I want to do this."

26:36.344 --> 26:39.620
<i>And it's all part of just
like feeding into this notion</i>

26:39.655 --> 26:41.655
<i>that if you work hard enough,</i>

26:41.689 --> 26:43.620
<i>you will get all of these
amazing things,</i>

26:43.655 --> 26:44.862
<i>like, you will get
this free trip,</i>

26:44.896 --> 26:46.275
<i>you'll get to meet
Mark and DeAnne,</i>

26:46.310 --> 26:47.482
who are like superstars.

26:49.344 --> 26:52.551
<i>And there's this one clip
of LuLaRoe's cruise</i>

26:53.551 --> 26:54.965
<i>and there's this scene
where, like,</i>

26:55.000 --> 26:57.310
<i>they're all out on the deck</i>

26:57.344 --> 26:59.655
<i>and they're all
dancing and partying,</i>

27:00.931 --> 27:03.931
and DeAnne and Mark
jump into the pool

27:03.965 --> 27:06.068
that's in the middle
of this deck on this ship.

27:15.275 --> 27:17.172
<i>They're in the pool
in their clothes,</i>

27:17.206 --> 27:20.206
<i>and it's just this like...
The Great Gatsby-esque shot.</i>

27:21.931 --> 27:24.034
They're just in the center
of this universe.

27:27.241 --> 27:28.793
MLM conferences

27:28.827 --> 27:33.551
are like a cross between
an evangelical tent revival.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.758
You shall not die,
but you shall live.

27:36.793 --> 27:39.206
<i>A Tony Robbins conference,</i>

27:39.241 --> 27:43.379
<i>a nightclub
discotheque extravaganza</i>

27:43.413 --> 27:45.172
<i>and a Katy Perry concert.</i>

27:45.206 --> 27:48.931
<i>In fact, Katy Perry did
perform at a LuLaRoe event.</i>

27:48.965 --> 27:52.068
<i>So they're really
just there to inspire,</i>

27:52.103 --> 27:55.206
to create
that sense of transcendence,

27:55.241 --> 27:57.620
to burn all of the messages

27:57.655 --> 27:59.655
that have been
delivered virtually

27:59.689 --> 28:03.517
into the recruits' brains.

28:03.551 --> 28:07.000
<i>When you participate
in a group language ritual</i>

28:07.034 --> 28:09.000
<i>with other people
doing the same thing,</i>

28:09.034 --> 28:13.137
<i>it has a physiological
de-stressing effect on you.</i>

28:13.172 --> 28:15.448
Your cortisol levels go down,

28:15.482 --> 28:18.448
your serotonin
and dopamine spike.

28:18.482 --> 28:20.482
This is why so many people

28:20.517 --> 28:25.034
have profound conversion
events when they go to church

28:25.068 --> 28:28.517
and listen to religious music
or speak in tongues.

28:28.551 --> 28:30.241
These are bonding events.

28:32.034 --> 28:35.103
<i>It's about
that person up at the top,</i>

28:35.758 --> 28:37.827
<i>speaking to their flock,</i>

28:37.862 --> 28:40.344
and in order
for that person at the top

28:40.379 --> 28:43.620
to be rich and to give
blessings down below,

28:43.655 --> 28:46.137
<i>the people from the bottom
must give, they must tithe.</i>

28:48.000 --> 28:49.655
<i>So you need recruitment.</i>

28:49.689 --> 28:51.689
<i>It's not really
about the product.</i>

28:51.724 --> 28:53.068
<i>They're selling a dream,
right?</i>

28:53.103 --> 28:54.655
<i>They're just, they're not
selling the reality,</i>

28:54.689 --> 28:55.931
they're selling the dream.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.413
Ready.

29:09.413 --> 29:13.965
<i>I do think LuLaRoe
was trying to sell</i>

29:14.000 --> 29:15.344
<i>the American dream.</i>

29:16.689 --> 29:17.965
That was horrible.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.517
I remember
their mission statement.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.586
It was...

29:22.206 --> 29:24.896
...bless... blessing, uh,

29:24.931 --> 29:27.655
blessing lives
and strengthening families.

29:31.379 --> 29:35.172
It was... nothing
but positivity and joy

29:35.206 --> 29:39.724
and... and this could be you,
this could be you.

29:39.758 --> 29:42.241
It really just seemed
like a wonderland.

29:49.068 --> 29:50.068
Argh!

29:50.655 --> 29:52.000
Let's go!

29:58.931 --> 30:01.896
So the first time
I ever encountered LuLaRoe,

30:02.862 --> 30:04.827
I was on a family cruise

30:04.862 --> 30:07.241
<i>and we were just
out on the beach</i>

30:07.275 --> 30:10.689
<i>and enjoying,
enjoying our time.</i>

30:10.724 --> 30:15.965
And there was this guy
playing Michael Jackson.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.586
<i>And so I just go
and I start dancing.</i>

30:21.448 --> 30:24.034
<i>This guy came
and approached me</i>

30:24.068 --> 30:26.965
<i>and said, "Hey, if I give you
$100,</i>

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
<i>will you wear
some female leggings</i>

30:30.034 --> 30:31.896
<i>and come and do
the same thing you just did</i>

30:31.931 --> 30:34.310
<i>tomorrow morning
at this business meeting?"</i>

30:34.344 --> 30:36.310
And I was just like, $100?

30:36.344 --> 30:37.896
Making money on vaca...

30:37.931 --> 30:39.655
Yeah, yeah.

30:39.689 --> 30:41.379
You best believe
I'm... I'm there.

30:44.172 --> 30:45.517
<i>So I showed up</i>

30:45.551 --> 30:48.413
and I just sat
in the back as a surprise.

30:48.448 --> 30:50.827
Elijah! Elijah! Elijah!

30:52.758 --> 30:54.724
He, you know, hyped up
the crowd and everything.

30:54.758 --> 30:58.068
Give it up for Elijah!

30:58.103 --> 31:01.068
<i>And then
I come in there
and I do my thing,</i>

31:01.103 --> 31:04.034
<i>you know, I just, I just
put it down, you know?</i>

31:16.517 --> 31:18.793
<i>Full, like,
pop and lock dance,</i>

31:18.827 --> 31:21.413
the ladies went crazy.
It was so fun.

31:21.448 --> 31:23.862
Oh, I loved it.

31:38.172 --> 31:40.137
<i>The whole atmosphere was just</i>

31:41.310 --> 31:43.448
full of joy
and excitement, like

31:43.482 --> 31:46.137
overwhelming joy
and excitement.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.068
Oh, not to mention,
it was a wholesome party.

31:49.103 --> 31:50.689
There was no alcohol.

31:50.724 --> 31:52.241
<i>So, I'm just like,</i>

31:52.275 --> 31:54.448
<i>"This is my place."</i>

31:54.482 --> 31:58.620
Like, you see how I am,
I'm a naturally just crazy and

31:58.655 --> 32:00.448
full of energy, I don't need

32:00.482 --> 32:02.172
anything to help me party.

32:04.793 --> 32:06.206
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

32:06.241 --> 32:09.896
Wow. Good morning.
Oh, we're just
getting started.

32:09.931 --> 32:13.310
You have no idea
how many amazing things
we have planned for you today

32:13.344 --> 32:15.172
and tomorrow. Oh, my gosh.

32:15.206 --> 32:17.034
And that's where
I met DeAnne and Mark.

32:23.310 --> 32:26.689
<i>So they flew me out
to one of the conventions.</i>

32:27.965 --> 32:32.000
LuLaRoe! LuLaRoe! LuLaRoe!

32:32.620 --> 32:35.379
<i>And DeAnne</i>

32:36.724 --> 32:40.137
called me on stage
to tell my "why",

32:41.482 --> 32:43.862
uh, and my mom
was in the crowd.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.482
<i>So, the "why"...</i>

32:48.758 --> 32:51.448
How can I describe
"the why", it was...

32:52.827 --> 32:54.379
Everyone has a "why",

32:55.068 --> 32:57.551
like a sob story to...

32:58.517 --> 33:00.103
...make you relate.

33:02.241 --> 33:05.206
<i>I, uh, told this crowd</i>

33:05.241 --> 33:07.689
<i>my "why",
I definitely got emotional.</i>

33:07.724 --> 33:10.517
'Cause all these people only
knew me as this hype man,
this...

33:11.413 --> 33:13.965
<i>crazy, rambunctious
kid that just</i>

33:14.965 --> 33:17.103
<i>thrives on positive energy.</i>

33:20.137 --> 33:21.862
<i>I got emotional because
my mom was out there</i>

33:21.896 --> 33:24.068
and I was just like,
"Yeah, I'm grateful for her.

33:24.103 --> 33:28.034
I want to become
successful enough to...
for her

33:28.068 --> 33:29.413
so that she
doesn't have to work

33:29.448 --> 33:30.758
ever again in her life."

33:31.206 --> 33:33.344
And...

33:33.379 --> 33:35.241
that's when
DeAnne onboarded her.

33:36.379 --> 33:38.965
<i>She pulled my mom on stage</i>

33:39.000 --> 33:42.931
<i>and then she onboarded my
mom to become a consultant.</i>

33:43.896 --> 33:45.206
And I was shocked.

33:45.241 --> 33:47.689
I didn't know,
I was like,
"Me, a consultant?"

33:47.724 --> 33:49.275
I don't even know
what LuLaRoe is.

33:49.310 --> 33:51.448
I didn't know anything,
you know,

33:51.482 --> 33:52.862
so I just went with it.

33:52.896 --> 33:55.103
So, when they were
coming up happy,

33:55.137 --> 33:57.068
I said, "Okay,"
you know, so...

33:57.862 --> 34:01.620
What am I wearing?
The Amelia.

34:01.655 --> 34:02.931
- Hey.
- How could you forget?

34:02.965 --> 34:05.413
How could I forget?
I'm learning inventory.

34:05.448 --> 34:08.517
This is my newfound business.

34:08.551 --> 34:10.965
<i>So my mom
became a consultant</i>

34:11.000 --> 34:13.620
<i>and my sister</i>

34:13.655 --> 34:16.517
<i>became a consultant
under my mom.</i>

34:16.551 --> 34:18.793
She saw me making money
and she was like, "Okay,

34:18.827 --> 34:19.965
I want to do it.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.275
I think I'm gonna
do it, Mom.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.137
I think I'm gonna sign
on and everything."

34:23.172 --> 34:25.655
I said, "Okay, well, make sure
you sign under me because

34:25.689 --> 34:28.310
I'll gain a percentage
of your sales.

34:28.344 --> 34:31.310
I'll make money off
the percentage of your sales."

34:31.344 --> 34:34.068
And so, she said
okay and sure enough, she did.

34:34.103 --> 34:35.241
Black and white cardigan.

34:35.275 --> 34:36.931
You can match
with a lot of things,

34:36.965 --> 34:39.344
like a mustard colored Carly.

34:39.379 --> 34:41.275
What? You have to be fly.

34:41.310 --> 34:42.793
You have to have that mindset.

34:42.827 --> 34:44.137
You know, let's do this

34:44.172 --> 34:45.827
and fight and work
real hard at it.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.103
Yeah. We are so blessed.

34:48.137 --> 34:50.172
You just don't know,
this company is the one.

34:50.206 --> 34:51.241
<i>For me,</i>

34:51.965 --> 34:54.482
that was when I felt, "Wow,

34:55.034 --> 34:58.103
they really are blessing

34:58.137 --> 35:00.000
and strengthening families."

35:31.517 --> 35:33.793
<i>I am a widowed single mom</i>

35:35.344 --> 35:38.275
and I am
a former LuLaRoe consultant,

35:38.310 --> 35:40.034
and now I own
Decades Rock 'N' Pop.

35:42.068 --> 35:44.724
<i>Before that, it was</i>

35:44.758 --> 35:47.103
<i>a LuLaRoe branded Airstream.</i>

35:49.793 --> 35:53.965
This is my new
boutique for LuLaRoe.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.448
Everything on social media
was perfect with LuLaRoe.

35:57.482 --> 35:58.965
She is about to push.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.275
She is adorable.

36:01.310 --> 36:03.620
A person would post
a picture of their new car.

36:03.655 --> 36:05.448
<i>♪BecauseOfLuLaRoe.</i>

36:05.482 --> 36:08.482
<i>Their vacation,
#BecauseOfLuLaRoe.</i>

36:08.517 --> 36:12.448
<i>Homes, events, parties, galas,</i>

36:12.482 --> 36:14.137
<i>Always #BecauseOfLuLaRoe.</i>

36:15.000 --> 36:16.517
Of course me
with the Airstream,

36:17.482 --> 36:18.965
because of LuLaRoe.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.206
<i>My entire lifestyle, really,</i>

36:21.241 --> 36:24.000
<i>it all became everything
LuLaRoe.</i>

36:27.310 --> 36:30.689
<i>There was definitely
a culture of toxic positivity</i>

36:30.724 --> 36:32.689
<i>because of what you
were allowed to share</i>

36:32.724 --> 36:34.827
<i>and what you weren't
allowed to share.</i>

36:34.862 --> 36:37.137
<i>So you were allowed
to share everything positive,</i>

36:37.172 --> 36:40.172
<i>but if anything negative
showed up on your pages,</i>

36:40.206 --> 36:43.517
under your comments,
under your sold comments,

36:43.551 --> 36:46.482
you were
supposed to delete it.

36:46.517 --> 36:48.448
<i>It never happened,
it was never on there.</i>

36:50.586 --> 36:52.482
So when I get those messages
from my team that I go,

36:53.034 --> 36:54.482
"Oh, my gosh.

36:54.517 --> 36:56.413
Why has LuLaRoe done
this to me?"

36:56.448 --> 36:57.517
Be an editor.

36:57.551 --> 36:59.137
Use that delete button.

36:59.172 --> 37:00.896
It's really powerful.

37:00.931 --> 37:01.965
I could not

37:02.965 --> 37:05.034
count the number
of times I was reprimanded

37:05.068 --> 37:06.689
for being "negative"

37:06.724 --> 37:09.275
because I was
trying to address

37:09.310 --> 37:11.724
legitimate business concerns.

37:11.758 --> 37:13.206
You know, if you complained,

37:13.241 --> 37:15.344
then you should,
you should just be grateful.

37:15.379 --> 37:18.413
If your business has
taken any kind of a dip,

37:18.448 --> 37:21.724
it's because you took
a slow thought process

37:21.758 --> 37:23.862
and got rubbernecking.

37:23.896 --> 37:25.793
Got yourself thinking
about the negativity.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.413
When I say, you had to
be sunshine and rainbows,

37:28.448 --> 37:31.103
you did, no real talk.

37:31.137 --> 37:33.620
<i>Everything was boss
girl, boss babe.</i>

37:33.655 --> 37:35.068
<i>Stay at home
and work in your pajamas.</i>

37:35.103 --> 37:36.827
Just... just like everything,

37:36.862 --> 37:38.413
everything,
everything was fake.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.724
<i>It was very, very common
to see the higher ranks</i>

37:43.758 --> 37:45.724
<i>sitting on a top of maybe</i>

37:46.517 --> 37:49.206
100 boxes of LuLaRoe

37:49.241 --> 37:50.517
stacked up
in front of their house.

37:51.551 --> 37:54.413
<i>So the way LuLaRoe's
structure worked</i>

37:54.448 --> 37:57.551
<i>was that it was
a surprise box.</i>

37:57.586 --> 37:58.931
You didn't know
what you were getting.

37:58.965 --> 38:01.758
You could choose your styles,
but you never knew the print.

38:01.793 --> 38:03.896
Today, I actually
have four boxes here.

38:03.931 --> 38:05.862
Look how nice.

38:05.896 --> 38:07.448
<i>You would say,
"Hey, Tuesday night,"</i>

38:07.482 --> 38:09.827
<i>I'm going to open
this box live, Facebook Live,"</i>

38:09.862 --> 38:11.241
and you'd be excited.

38:11.275 --> 38:13.137
These are gorgeous,
these might,

38:13.172 --> 38:16.586
might, might be my favorite.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.655
<i>And people would start
claiming the second</i>

38:18.689 --> 38:20.310
you opened it up
and they wanted it.

38:20.344 --> 38:22.482
<i>That's how big
the LuLaRoe craze was.</i>

38:22.517 --> 38:26.310
Favorite ever, you guys,
favorite ever.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.448
But it also started
draining money right

38:28.482 --> 38:30.965
from the beginning.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.655
<i>It was kind of like
playing a scratch off
lottery ticket</i>

38:33.689 --> 38:34.758
<i>every time
you placed an order.</i>

38:37.517 --> 38:39.344
<i>It was very, very addicting.</i>

38:39.379 --> 38:41.413
<i>And then, once you
start getting good boxes,</i>

38:41.448 --> 38:43.137
<i>you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna
order another one,</i>

38:44.482 --> 38:46.000
because I sold half my box."

38:46.827 --> 38:48.827
Well, you sold half your box,

38:48.862 --> 38:50.448
you're really
not making anything.

39:01.655 --> 39:03.068
Oh, my leg.

39:04.206 --> 39:06.206
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:06.241 --> 39:08.172
Mama, what's this one?

39:08.206 --> 39:11.551
- Okay, so that
is the perfect tee.
- Yes.

39:11.586 --> 39:13.965
That's actually what
I have on, but I tied it.
Yes.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Ma, do you have
any unicorn leggings?

39:16.034 --> 39:18.000
- These... I had...
- Unicorn.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.896
What do you think
about that, Zip?

39:20.724 --> 39:22.206
Oh, I...
- These kiwis.

39:22.241 --> 39:23.586
Hang on, let's see where.

39:26.379 --> 39:28.413
So, what a unicorn is,

39:28.448 --> 39:32.551
it would be like
a very unique print,

39:32.586 --> 39:36.172
<i>a hot commodity
that everyone had to have,</i>

39:36.206 --> 39:38.241
<i>almost like you
can flaunt with it</i>

39:38.827 --> 39:40.068
and be like, "Yeah,

39:41.103 --> 39:42.620
I got something
that you don't have."

39:42.655 --> 39:43.724
This one is a...

39:43.758 --> 39:45.172
Ooh. Those are kind of cool.

39:45.206 --> 39:47.379
That's an owl with
the headphones on.

39:47.413 --> 39:50.517
- These are huge unicorns.
- LuLaRoe.

39:50.551 --> 39:52.827
Because it's the shades with

39:52.862 --> 39:55.241
LuLaRoe emblem
on these things.

39:55.275 --> 39:56.344
Come on now.

39:56.379 --> 39:58.620
I know one for a fact was

39:58.655 --> 40:00.724
all black leggings like,

40:00.758 --> 40:03.827
if you got
all black leggings, then,

40:04.413 --> 40:06.241
oh, you got it like, it

40:06.724 --> 40:08.206
sold instantly.

40:08.241 --> 40:10.310
- Oh, those are fly.
- I know these are fire,

40:10.344 --> 40:13.344
but I don't know
if they would be unicorns.

40:13.379 --> 40:15.379
- No, maybe not.
- They're unicorn to me.
Mmm-hmm

40:17.000 --> 40:18.413
I mean, people would tell
they had like

40:18.448 --> 40:19.827
hundreds of pairs of LuLaRoe,

40:19.862 --> 40:22.172
like more leggings
than you could ever wear.

40:22.206 --> 40:24.896
It was like
a collecting kind of craze.

40:24.931 --> 40:26.655
They created their own,

40:26.689 --> 40:29.413
um, hysteria around
these leggings.

40:29.448 --> 40:32.724
You know,
as a business person,
I'm like, I was like, smart.

40:32.758 --> 40:34.724
- Do you wanna follow us?
- Yeah.

40:34.758 --> 40:36.655
Do you wanna follow us
through the warehouse
a little bit?

40:36.689 --> 40:40.655
You have to see the amazing
pieces that are here.

40:41.275 --> 40:43.034
Look at these.

40:43.068 --> 40:44.379
DeAnne just scored two

40:44.413 --> 40:46.137
Tie Dye Carlys.

40:46.172 --> 40:47.206
Yeah. Because you know what?

40:47.241 --> 40:49.034
I am the owner,
and I never get Tie Dyes

40:49.068 --> 40:51.344
'cause you guys
all buy them up so fast.

40:51.379 --> 40:53.103
It has been
the best day of my life.

40:53.137 --> 40:55.379
Well, look at them.
Look at everybody's busy,
busy, busy,

40:55.413 --> 40:57.620
pulling your orders.
So get out there and order,
order, order, order

40:57.655 --> 40:59.586
more fresh stuff, yo.

41:08.724 --> 41:09.827
<i>Before LuLaRoe,</i>

41:09.862 --> 41:12.413
<i>by all accounts,
Mark and DeAnne were</i>

41:12.448 --> 41:14.931
<i>a semi-normal family.</i>

41:14.965 --> 41:18.000
<i>They had a pretty modest
house for California.</i>

41:22.310 --> 41:24.275
<i>After LuLaRoe,</i>

41:24.310 --> 41:26.655
<i>they have balled out for sure.</i>

41:27.655 --> 41:30.206
<i>They bought this extremely</i>

41:30.241 --> 41:32.448
<i>lavish Wyoming ranch</i>

41:32.482 --> 41:35.931
<i>that they host their
family on a lot,</i>

41:35.965 --> 41:38.482
<i>and it's very
glamorous looking.</i>

41:39.827 --> 41:43.137
<i>Mark has also used his wealth</i>

41:43.172 --> 41:46.034
<i>to buy a lot of luxury cars.</i>

41:46.068 --> 41:48.551
<i>One of them broke
the land speed record.</i>

41:51.275 --> 41:54.034
<i>The Stidhams flaunted that
they were becoming wealthy</i>

41:54.068 --> 41:55.862
<i>because that is kind of</i>

41:55.896 --> 41:58.793
<i>part of the company model,
right?</i>

41:58.827 --> 42:01.758
<i>Like, you want
to show how successful</i>

42:01.793 --> 42:04.000
<i>you're being because</i>

42:04.034 --> 42:06.827
that will inspire other
people to try it as well.

42:06.862 --> 42:08.793
<i>We are in...
Gucci, shopping.</i>

42:08.827 --> 42:11.206
<i>Look at these girls
and look how cute.</i>

42:11.241 --> 42:12.448
<i>This is what we do.</i>

42:12.482 --> 42:15.137
<i>DeAnne was what
these women thought</i>

42:15.172 --> 42:17.862
<i>they could become if they
just had enough money.</i>

42:22.689 --> 42:25.655
The millionaire mindset
or a thought of

42:26.068 --> 42:28.344
how can I become

42:29.517 --> 42:31.793
and strive
with the opportunities

42:31.827 --> 42:33.620
that are right
in front of me.

42:33.655 --> 42:35.724
<i>Family is very important
to the Stidhams,</i>

42:35.758 --> 42:38.551
<i>so DeAnne hired basically
all of her children</i>

42:38.586 --> 42:40.448
<i>in one capacity or another.</i>

42:40.482 --> 42:43.620
We want to introduce
you to our family,

42:43.655 --> 42:45.344
which also happens to be

42:45.379 --> 42:47.965
a core part
of the home office team.

42:50.379 --> 42:51.793
<i>Mark and I thought about</i>

42:51.827 --> 42:53.172
<i>the people that we wanted most</i>

42:53.206 --> 42:54.655
<i>to be involved were our kids.</i>

42:54.689 --> 42:56.000
We knew they could help us.

42:56.034 --> 42:58.206
I remember
my parents just saying,

42:58.241 --> 42:59.586
"We want to present
the opportunity

42:59.620 --> 43:01.689
to our kids first."

43:01.724 --> 43:03.758
They wanted us to be
a part of something that

43:04.310 --> 43:05.379
they were seeing success

43:05.413 --> 43:07.206
and they didn't
want it for themselves.

43:07.241 --> 43:10.862
LuLaRoe really became
a very incestuous

43:10.896 --> 43:14.000
when it came to how
they promoted people

43:14.034 --> 43:16.275
<i>and who was
running the company.</i>

43:16.310 --> 43:17.965
<i>And I mean, the Stidhams</i>

43:18.000 --> 43:20.241
<i>decided that they
were going to employ as,</i>

43:20.275 --> 43:23.034
<i>I guess, as many family
members as they could.</i>

43:23.068 --> 43:24.758
<i>And in my opinion,</i>

43:24.793 --> 43:28.068
<i>it was also a way of them
controlling everything.</i>

43:28.103 --> 43:31.862
<i>Because their family would
be totally loyal to them</i>

43:31.896 --> 43:35.241
and would do
what was necessary,

43:35.275 --> 43:37.034
in order to keep
the business going,

43:37.068 --> 43:40.344
according to the dictates
of its founders.

43:40.379 --> 43:42.551
So as the business was
very small in the beginning,

43:42.586 --> 43:45.103
my wife said, "I'd like
to have our kids involved."

43:45.137 --> 43:46.620
They all had
different skill sets

43:46.655 --> 43:49.241
and they were
the first executive team.

43:49.275 --> 43:52.896
I think the values
of MLMs align

43:52.931 --> 43:55.275
perfectly with

43:55.310 --> 43:57.379
the way we think
about money in America

43:57.413 --> 43:59.655
or the way we preach
about money in America.

43:59.689 --> 44:01.448
Big things are happening.

44:01.482 --> 44:02.758
They will continue to happen

44:02.793 --> 44:04.827
by those that
are part of this company.

44:07.344 --> 44:09.172
<i>MLMs probably
wouldn't exist without</i>

44:09.206 --> 44:11.931
<i>the prosperity gospel,
and what it</i>

44:12.689 --> 44:14.965
<i>espouses is that Mormonism</i>

44:15.000 --> 44:17.103
in particular, being blessed

44:17.137 --> 44:19.620
with money is like literally
being blessed by God,

44:19.655 --> 44:21.724
like God favors you

44:21.758 --> 44:23.862
if you are wealthy.

44:23.896 --> 44:26.931
You want to know, if you're
good to your fellow man,

44:26.965 --> 44:29.310
then...
then look around and see...

44:30.862 --> 44:32.517
check your bank account.

44:32.551 --> 44:34.344
If you have spent
your entire life

44:35.310 --> 44:37.275
hearing the prosperity gospel

44:37.310 --> 44:39.172
and hearing that you
can pull yourself

44:39.206 --> 44:40.413
up by your bootstraps,

44:40.448 --> 44:42.517
then when someone
comes along and says,

44:42.551 --> 44:44.068
"Here, actually,
you can do it,

44:44.103 --> 44:46.482
and you don't have to go
have any student debt."

44:46.517 --> 44:48.689
You know, and you can
be the boss.

44:48.724 --> 44:50.965
Then we're all kind
of primed for it

44:51.000 --> 44:53.275
from birth here
in the United States.

44:53.310 --> 44:54.793
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

44:54.827 --> 44:56.655
And when you are ready
and you are determined,

44:56.689 --> 44:58.000
you're gonna do
whatever it takes.

44:58.034 --> 45:01.517
Remember that I will persist
until I succeed.

45:01.551 --> 45:03.896
I wasn't even a year in
and I was attending almost

45:03.931 --> 45:06.586
every training that I could
either fly or drive to.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.965
By getting here, you prove
to yourself

45:10.000 --> 45:12.068
that this was where you
needed to be

45:12.103 --> 45:14.655
<i>at the most important time
of your business.</i>

45:18.413 --> 45:19.896
<i>They convinced me</i>

45:19.931 --> 45:21.137
<i>to... to buy more,</i>

45:21.931 --> 45:23.310
<i>buy more, sell more.</i>

45:23.344 --> 45:25.379
<i>The bigger your business is,
the more you're gonna sell</i>

45:25.413 --> 45:26.758
<i>because more people
will come to you</i>

45:26.793 --> 45:28.793
because you have more stuff
in your pictures,

45:28.827 --> 45:32.344
and, you know, they
encourage that.

45:32.379 --> 45:34.000
What they, LuLaRoe, would tell
you to do,

45:34.034 --> 45:35.241
and especially the leaders,

45:35.275 --> 45:37.620
is to put the money back in

45:37.655 --> 45:39.068
to buy more inventory

45:39.103 --> 45:41.068
and to grow your inventory.

45:41.103 --> 45:42.620
<i>So that's exactly what I did.</i>

45:42.655 --> 45:45.034
<i>As much as I could,</i>

45:45.068 --> 45:48.862
<i>um, use to buy more clothing
and add more styles,</i>

45:48.896 --> 45:50.172
<i>and sizes and colors,</i>

45:50.206 --> 45:52.310
<i>I would, I would put it
all back in.</i>

45:52.344 --> 45:55.000
I had somebody
underneath of me who, um...

45:56.862 --> 45:58.724
sold $12,000 in one month.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.379
And then she said to me,

46:01.413 --> 46:02.965
"But I spent $12,000."

46:03.793 --> 46:05.275
And I said to her,

46:05.310 --> 46:07.379
"Well, you had to spend
money to make money."

46:07.413 --> 46:10.103
<i>"Order more inventory
and you'll do better."</i>

46:10.137 --> 46:11.655
<i>It was just kind
of always a blanket.</i>

46:12.655 --> 46:14.137
What can I do to make
my business better?

46:14.172 --> 46:16.655
Like, if you stood in line
to talk to DeAnne

46:18.000 --> 46:19.758
and she would...
like, her first question,

46:19.793 --> 46:21.413
probably back to you
probably would have been,

46:21.448 --> 46:23.379
"Well, how much inventory
have you ordered this month?"

46:25.310 --> 46:27.413
Remember, you ought to
be placing orders

46:27.448 --> 46:29.896
every single day, do not wait

46:29.931 --> 46:32.275
for things to be restocked.

46:32.310 --> 46:34.896
You order what is available
to you every day.

46:34.931 --> 46:36.827
Every dollar that we made,

46:36.862 --> 46:40.413
they would tell us to reinvest
it back into more clothes.

46:40.448 --> 46:42.586
Order consistently
to replenish

46:42.620 --> 46:43.793
the sales that you're having.

46:43.827 --> 46:45.931
Always felt more pressure
to buy more merchandise.

46:45.965 --> 46:47.793
They always told us,

46:47.827 --> 46:49.758
"The more you have,
the more you sell."

46:49.793 --> 46:51.965
The more you buy,
the more you sell.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.517
Like, it's not ethical.

46:53.551 --> 46:54.758
Look at your inventory,

46:54.793 --> 46:56.068
analyze what you're selling,

46:56.103 --> 46:59.517
analyze what season is coming,
what you intend to sell

46:59.551 --> 47:01.448
and order consistently

47:01.482 --> 47:03.275
to sell consistently

47:03.310 --> 47:04.517
so that your business

47:04.551 --> 47:06.172
will consistently grow.

47:06.206 --> 47:09.517
They're making money off
every single box you order.

47:09.551 --> 47:11.689
That's why they're telling you
to order more boxes.

47:12.551 --> 47:13.655
And you know what?

47:13.689 --> 47:16.103
Maybe that was part
of their plan for sending you,

47:16.137 --> 47:20.137
you know, a box full of half
of it is unsellable crap

47:20.172 --> 47:23.034
because they know
they're gonna just tell you,

47:23.068 --> 47:25.965
"Oh, you couldn't sell
half of it, order more."

47:26.000 --> 47:27.896
So size medium Julia.

47:27.931 --> 47:29.862
You can layer it, you can
put a Lindsay over it,

47:29.896 --> 47:31.034
you can put a Shirley over it,

47:31.068 --> 47:32.448
you can put a Joy over it.

47:32.482 --> 47:35.551
I was just consumed
and obsessed with selling,

47:35.586 --> 47:38.517
that was for sure. I just got
the endorphins as soon as
I had a sale.

47:38.551 --> 47:41.827
Heart pink and a gold
and it's kind of like
an Aztec look to it.

47:41.862 --> 47:44.379
So you have these pretty
triangles.

47:44.413 --> 47:46.965
Here's my sales for the day.
I got to beat it tomorrow,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.448
and I was just competing,
I guess, with myself and just,

47:50.482 --> 47:53.793
"Hey, you know, I sold
1,000 today.
Let's do 1,500 tomorrow."

47:53.827 --> 47:57.586
You have black, would be
super cute wearing it
with black leggings

47:57.620 --> 47:59.137
and wearing this as a tunic.

47:59.172 --> 48:01.862
I wanted to hit those top
rankings, you know,

48:01.896 --> 48:03.344
to show that I was a success.

48:04.241 --> 48:05.275
Super pretty.

48:05.310 --> 48:07.034
Someone can just rock
this dress.

48:07.068 --> 48:08.448
They train you to think
this way.

48:09.413 --> 48:10.413
They're so good at it.

48:11.034 --> 48:12.793
Every single week.

48:12.827 --> 48:15.103
You know, with the webinar
and all of the trainings,

48:15.137 --> 48:18.068
and they're encouraging,
you know, go to the trainings.

48:18.103 --> 48:19.517
<i>This is where it's at.</i>

48:19.551 --> 48:22.068
<i>This is where the excitement
is created,</i>

48:22.103 --> 48:23.517
<i>all of us coming together</i>

48:23.551 --> 48:26.862
and creating bigger,
better businesses together.

48:26.896 --> 48:28.551
It just went from like,

48:28.586 --> 48:29.931
nice and calm

48:29.965 --> 48:32.413
<i>to very much high-paced job</i>

48:32.448 --> 48:34.344
<i>that I had to keep up in.</i>

48:34.379 --> 48:36.206
'Cause if you don't keep up,
you fail.

48:36.241 --> 48:39.103
263, large royal blue.

48:39.137 --> 48:42.413
1483, small black lace.
Polka dots.

48:42.448 --> 48:44.275
Like 16-hour days.

48:44.310 --> 48:46.931
I would wake up and I had
all these orders

48:46.965 --> 48:48.793
that I saw immediately,
as soon as I got up,

48:48.827 --> 48:51.068
before I went to the bathroom,
I would go pull orders.

48:51.103 --> 48:54.034
We were like 24/7,
all the time.

48:54.068 --> 48:55.689
What's the next thing
we can do?

48:55.724 --> 48:58.000
I never felt like I could
take a break.

48:58.034 --> 48:59.000
I just had to keep going.

49:03.862 --> 49:06.793
<i>Day one, working
for LuLaRoe was...</i>

49:06.827 --> 49:08.965
I would say, hit
the ground running.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.620
As a professional designer,

49:10.655 --> 49:13.517
I understand that I'm not
designing for myself,

49:13.551 --> 49:15.068
<i>I'm designing for the company,</i>

49:15.103 --> 49:16.758
and what they wanted was...

49:17.448 --> 49:20.689
loud, busy, eye-catching.

49:20.724 --> 49:23.620
Our main direction was just
make it pop.

49:29.965 --> 49:32.551
When you're working
in production, there's always
this balance

49:32.586 --> 49:35.482
of quality and quantity,

49:35.517 --> 49:36.931
and with LuLaRoe,
it was like...

49:39.137 --> 49:41.068
<i>So we were given the task</i>

49:41.103 --> 49:43.655
<i>by, Patrick, the head
of design and production,</i>

49:43.689 --> 49:45.310
<i>to design</i>

49:45.344 --> 49:46.724
<i>a thousand prints,</i>

49:46.758 --> 49:48.586
<i>in one day between</i>

49:49.310 --> 49:51.827
<i>me and three other designers.</i>

49:51.862 --> 49:54.586
It would be open
and existing print,

49:55.379 --> 49:57.655
<i>change of color, save it.</i>

49:57.689 --> 50:00.137
<i>Put stripes over it, save it.</i>

50:00.172 --> 50:02.827
<i>Put the stripes
in the background, save it.</i>

50:02.862 --> 50:04.000
Open another pattern,

50:05.034 --> 50:06.620
put it over
the existing pattern

50:06.655 --> 50:10.000
to make this unholy mash up
of two patterns.

50:10.758 --> 50:11.965
You know, does it look good?

50:12.482 --> 50:14.827
No. Save it.

50:14.862 --> 50:17.758
It was a stressful
environment.

50:17.793 --> 50:20.482
<i>By the end of the day,
Patrick would have
a thousand patterns</i>

50:20.517 --> 50:25.068
to choose from,
and how many actually
made it to production,

50:25.586 --> 50:26.689
I have no idea.

50:28.586 --> 50:30.000
The evidence.

50:32.931 --> 50:34.620
Oh, boy.

50:34.655 --> 50:36.137
They stopped producing

50:36.172 --> 50:39.034
the inventory
that I joined for.

50:39.068 --> 50:42.275
<i>I don't want print
overlay over print overlay.</i>

50:42.310 --> 50:43.827
<i>The yuck colors,</i>

50:43.862 --> 50:48.137
<i>the oranges, the weird shades
of mustard, stripes,</i>

50:48.172 --> 50:50.344
<i>ugly flowers.</i>

50:50.379 --> 50:52.896
A jaguar, a bear.

50:52.931 --> 50:55.931
None of them appearing
from the crotch.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.000
So, that's good.

50:59.310 --> 51:00.793
<i>Uh, lot of shapes.</i>

51:00.827 --> 51:03.482
A pattern layered on top
of a pattern.

51:05.689 --> 51:07.551
God! There's just so many
of them.

51:07.586 --> 51:08.896
Here she is.

51:08.931 --> 51:11.137
We're like, "Okay."

51:12.724 --> 51:14.862
There were some
questionable prints.

51:14.896 --> 51:17.827
<i>You know, they put the...
the designer, Patrick.</i>

51:17.862 --> 51:20.344
<i>They put DeAnne, Mark
on a pair of leggings,</i>

51:20.379 --> 51:22.655
<i>like we had actual clothes
with their faces on it.</i>

51:23.517 --> 51:25.689
Uh, it was just strange.

51:28.413 --> 51:31.068
This one, I designed
the ghost.

51:31.862 --> 51:34.206
Owl eyes, peacock feathers,

51:34.724 --> 51:36.379
tribal, ethnic.

51:36.413 --> 51:37.482
<i>I don't know.</i>

51:37.517 --> 51:39.137
We get the boxes.
We open it up.

51:39.862 --> 51:40.862
And it was like,

51:42.689 --> 51:44.310
"What the hell is this?"

51:50.620 --> 51:52.862
All of the color vomit

51:52.896 --> 51:54.827
you could put on fabric

51:54.862 --> 51:57.241
encapsulated in these
brown boxes.

51:57.758 --> 51:59.724
We were horrified.

51:59.758 --> 52:02.206
No one in the fucking world

52:02.241 --> 52:03.896
wants to wear leggings

52:03.931 --> 52:05.586
that feature a bee

52:05.620 --> 52:07.793
<i>crawling up your cooch.</i>

52:09.275 --> 52:12.517
Oh, my God!
That bee is gonna sting
your big pink pearl.

52:18.793 --> 52:19.896
No.

52:25.137 --> 52:27.379
<i>Blake is my 22-year-old son.</i>

52:28.758 --> 52:30.724
<i>And he signed up</i>

52:30.758 --> 52:33.482
<i>to sell LuLaRoe
under me and...</i>

52:35.241 --> 52:36.896
I wish I could have talked him
out of it.

52:36.931 --> 52:37.931
His onboarding package

52:37.965 --> 52:40.793
was horrendous.

52:41.655 --> 52:43.275
The worst I'd ever seen.

52:43.310 --> 52:45.586
Okay, any other...
anything else we can show?

52:45.620 --> 52:47.448
We have just so much,

52:47.482 --> 52:50.620
- so much.
- Here's your number...
number 17.

52:50.655 --> 52:52.620
And so this is
number 30 right here.

52:52.655 --> 52:54.620
It's pretty green one.

52:54.655 --> 52:56.862
I just remember trying
to pattern mix

52:56.896 --> 52:58.793
and put this with like
a striped shirt

52:58.827 --> 53:02.620
and just thinking,
"This is the ugliest
thing I've ever seen,

53:02.655 --> 53:03.931
but I've gotta sell it."

53:03.965 --> 53:05.000
I think it's,

53:05.689 --> 53:07.206
I think it's gorgeous.

53:07.241 --> 53:09.172
And this one, which is going
to be the gray sleeves

53:09.206 --> 53:11.551
with a really pretty
dark blue background

53:11.586 --> 53:13.206
with pinks, purples, corals.

53:13.241 --> 53:16.034
<i>When I saw that box,
I actually called home office</i>

53:16.068 --> 53:17.620
<i>and said,</i>

53:17.655 --> 53:20.448
"Do you understand what you
just sent my recruit"?

53:20.482 --> 53:22.448
I wasn't trying to make
it my son. I'm like,

53:22.482 --> 53:24.517
"Do you understand
his onboarding package?

53:24.551 --> 53:27.827
Like, I've been in here
for three years.
I couldn't sell that."

53:27.862 --> 53:31.275
Gray with... tigers.

53:31.310 --> 53:32.724
Like, with black tigers
on them.

53:32.758 --> 53:34.827
Number 1404.
This is an extra small.

53:34.862 --> 53:36.344
I always remember her saying,

53:36.379 --> 53:38.344
"This isn't good stuff.
We've gotta get it returned."

53:38.379 --> 53:40.517
I have this one which is
so gorgeous black background,

53:40.551 --> 53:42.206
there's really
gorgeous flowers

53:42.241 --> 53:43.724
on there, golden flowers.

53:43.758 --> 53:45.448
And I just remember
thinking,
"I've got to do it.

53:45.482 --> 53:47.310
I've gotta push it.
I can do this."

53:47.344 --> 53:49.172
And then, I remember
my first live,

53:49.655 --> 53:50.758
I sold a pair,

53:50.793 --> 53:52.758
and I've sold my very
first shirt,

53:52.793 --> 53:54.310
and I remember just
looking to her

53:54.344 --> 53:56.793
and being like,
"Yes, I did it,
I can do this."

53:56.827 --> 53:59.379
And then I'm pretty sure
I sold one other piece
that live.

53:59.413 --> 54:00.689
And then from there,
I would do lives

54:00.724 --> 54:02.275
and not sell anything.

54:02.310 --> 54:04.034
And then from there, about
six or eight months later,

54:04.068 --> 54:06.241
I just kind of tapered off
and they went into a box

54:06.275 --> 54:07.275
and I never sold them again.

54:08.448 --> 54:10.965
You can't go overnight,

54:11.896 --> 54:13.241
you know, making

54:13.275 --> 54:16.758
clothing for a few
thousand people,

54:17.310 --> 54:18.931
to making boxes

54:18.965 --> 54:21.103
full of clothing
for 80,000 people.

54:22.034 --> 54:23.758
You have to cut
corners somewhere.

54:32.862 --> 54:34.586
<i>It was madness over here.</i>

54:34.620 --> 54:37.620
<i>They ship, receive
everything here.</i>

54:37.655 --> 54:39.724
<i>That's where they would park
right there, all the Mercedes,</i>

54:39.758 --> 54:40.965
<i>all their flashy cars.</i>

54:41.896 --> 54:43.413
I was working at LuLaRoe

54:43.448 --> 54:46.000
from March of 2016

54:46.034 --> 54:48.862
to January of 2017.

54:48.896 --> 54:51.517
For what amount
we were gonna
do on a day, I was like

54:51.551 --> 54:54.241
15 million, 12 million
in a day.

54:54.275 --> 54:56.172
Okay, walking,
walking, walking.

54:56.206 --> 54:57.793
<i>This is what it looks like.</i>

54:57.827 --> 54:59.586
<i>Leggings, leggings
and leggings.</i>

54:59.620 --> 55:00.965
<i>More leggings.</i>

55:01.000 --> 55:02.448
<i>It's like, get busy.</i>

55:02.482 --> 55:04.310
<i>Everybody, start selling.</i>

55:04.344 --> 55:06.482
We can go see where they
have their moldy
clothes at.

55:10.827 --> 55:12.793
<i>The warehouse was full.</i>

55:12.827 --> 55:14.586
<i>It was packed to the brim.</i>

55:14.620 --> 55:18.517
<i>And somebody decided to put...
start putting clothes outside.</i>

55:18.551 --> 55:20.724
<i>One night, like it started
to drizzle,</i>

55:20.758 --> 55:22.793
<i>and the next day, sunny.</i>

55:22.827 --> 55:24.620
And then as time went on,

55:24.655 --> 55:28.000
nobody really noticed
like the molding yet.

55:28.034 --> 55:31.793
And yeah, starting to get into
the... to get shipped out.

55:34.965 --> 55:36.103
Thousands.

55:38.206 --> 55:39.517
Yeah, it's a lot of clothes.

55:42.724 --> 55:47.413
I'm sorry.
Y'all just taking on the tour
of the LuLaRoe, uh...

55:52.137 --> 55:53.689
All right,
we're taking off, man.

55:57.344 --> 55:58.620
Why is he so angry?

56:03.724 --> 56:05.758
<i>When people describe</i>

56:05.793 --> 56:08.862
<i>MLMs to you, they'll draw you
a pyramid,</i>

56:08.896 --> 56:11.206
and at the bottom
of the pyramid,

56:11.241 --> 56:13.068
like the visible base,

56:13.103 --> 56:15.586
um, you see just more
retailers, right?

56:15.620 --> 56:17.379
Like that's a line
of retailers.

56:17.413 --> 56:20.000
<i>But I think there's
an invisible face</i>

56:20.034 --> 56:22.758
<i>that gets left out of all
of those graphics,</i>

56:22.793 --> 56:24.827
<i>and that's made up
of all the people</i>

56:24.862 --> 56:26.482
<i>who are making the products</i>

56:26.517 --> 56:28.137
<i>that all the retailers
are selling.</i>

56:43.034 --> 56:44.655
<i>The people
at the very bottom
of the LuLaRoe</i>

56:44.689 --> 56:47.586
pyramid are not white
Christian stay-at-home moms.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.827
Um, they're the people
making the leggings.

57:21.172 --> 57:22.965
And let me show you
what I got,

57:23.000 --> 57:24.344
because it's a piece of crap.

57:24.379 --> 57:26.068
<i>She's fighting mad.</i>

57:26.103 --> 57:28.862
<i>She is just one of thousands
of women complaining</i>

57:28.896 --> 57:30.965
<i>about the super soft leggings
they purchased,</i>

57:31.000 --> 57:33.379
<i>only to discover
they have holes.</i>

57:33.413 --> 57:34.862
They're ripping, um, they're

57:34.896 --> 57:36.103
wearing them for a few hours,

57:36.137 --> 57:37.965
they're wearing them
for a few minutes
and finding holes

57:38.000 --> 57:39.827
and large, substantial tears.

57:39.862 --> 57:42.172
<i>Christina Hinks
used to sell the leggings.</i>

57:42.206 --> 57:45.551
<i>She showed me a pair
that an angry customer
returned to her.</i>

57:48.448 --> 57:50.482
<i>I remember like my third,</i>

57:50.517 --> 57:52.000
third or fourth order,

57:52.034 --> 57:54.482
getting the ever-coveted black.

57:54.517 --> 57:56.413
Solid black leggings.

57:56.448 --> 57:58.517
And I was like, "Well, shit,

57:58.551 --> 58:00.137
<i>I'm gonna keep
one of these for me,"
you know.</i>

58:00.172 --> 58:01.689
<i>The day that I wore them,</i>

58:01.724 --> 58:02.931
<i>I fell asleep on my couch.</i>

58:04.034 --> 58:06.586
I was woken up a few hours
later by the baby crying,

58:06.620 --> 58:08.931
and I got up
and my husband's cackling.

58:09.482 --> 58:10.482
Cackling.

58:11.068 --> 58:12.275
"What's funny?"

58:12.310 --> 58:15.068
He's like,
"Christina, your ass
looks like Swiss cheese."

58:15.103 --> 58:16.620
Went into the bathroom,
took my pants off,

58:16.655 --> 58:18.620
and you could put
your whole hand

58:18.655 --> 58:21.724
<i>through the holes
in my left butt cheek.</i>

58:21.758 --> 58:23.448
And I said, "Okay,
it must be a fluke."

58:23.482 --> 58:24.724
So, I pulled the second
pair out

58:25.517 --> 58:27.551
and I put them on.
Same thing.

58:28.310 --> 58:29.413
I was pissed.

58:29.448 --> 58:30.551
That's when I started digging.

58:30.586 --> 58:32.586
That's when I started
reaching out to people.

58:33.310 --> 58:35.551
<i>MommyGyver was a blog</i>

58:35.586 --> 58:39.103
<i>that I created to sort
of empower women</i>

58:39.137 --> 58:40.310
<i>to do their own things,</i>

58:42.379 --> 58:43.724
<i>like MacGyver,</i>

58:43.758 --> 58:45.793
<i>who could turn anything
into anything.</i>

58:53.172 --> 58:54.275
So I had started

58:54.310 --> 58:56.344
writing MommyGyver
around, um,

58:56.379 --> 58:57.586
May and June

58:57.620 --> 58:59.965
of the... of 2016-ish.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.034
<i>And I really started
writing about LuLaRoe.</i>

59:04.068 --> 59:06.655
<i>I think the first post
I made was in December.</i>

59:06.689 --> 59:07.862
<i>When I first started writing,</i>

59:07.896 --> 59:09.379
<i>nobody wanted to cover it.</i>

59:09.413 --> 59:11.103
It wasn't a big enough
dumpster fire

59:11.137 --> 59:12.586
for them to see the fire

59:12.620 --> 59:14.206
from way high up.

59:14.241 --> 59:16.000
And I felt obligated.

59:16.034 --> 59:18.689
I felt like I had
to say something

59:18.724 --> 59:20.000
because if I didn't,
who would?

59:22.103 --> 59:24.862
<i>All of these, these women
were sending me messages.</i>

59:24.896 --> 59:26.310
<i>This particular consultant</i>

59:26.344 --> 59:28.034
<i>was baited to onboard
with the understanding</i>

59:28.068 --> 59:30.965
that it would only take
her 20 hours a week
to make full-time pay.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.448
She states that, um,

59:32.482 --> 59:34.344
<i>she learned very quickly
it's not a part-time job,</i>

59:34.379 --> 59:36.517
<i>and even exceeded
full-time hours,</i>

59:36.551 --> 59:38.275
<i>as was my experience.</i>

59:38.310 --> 59:39.793
<i>As I started digging through</i>

59:39.827 --> 59:41.965
<i>and as I started going
higher up and higher up</i>

59:42.000 --> 59:44.034
<i>and into their close circles,</i>

59:44.068 --> 59:46.689
<i>I was finding
leaders telling people</i>

59:46.724 --> 59:49.310
<i>how to get other women
to buy in.</i>

59:49.344 --> 59:54.000
<i>Know most people don't have
$5,000, $10,000
at their disposal,</i>

59:54.034 --> 59:55.344
<i>but that's okay.</i>

59:55.379 --> 59:58.586
They can take that
credit card with $5,000
or $10,000 maximum

59:58.620 --> 59:59.862
and they can max it out.

59:59.896 --> 1:00:02.689
My sponsor initially had
suggested to me maybe

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:07.172
that I try, um, crowd funding.

1:00:07.206 --> 1:00:11.965
In the end, to come up
with a last little bit, um,

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.103
we ended up
not paying some bills.

1:00:14.137 --> 1:00:16.034
At one point, there was
a document given to me

1:00:16.068 --> 1:00:19.517
<i>where it was created
by a top consultant,</i>

1:00:19.551 --> 1:00:22.103
<i>and it was how to come up
with the money.</i>

1:00:22.137 --> 1:00:24.379
Um, ask you friends
and family for a loan.

1:00:24.413 --> 1:00:26.689
Borrow from your
children's college fund.

1:00:26.724 --> 1:00:28.448
You can get a loan.
You can get...

1:00:28.482 --> 1:00:32.620
Um, use credit cards,
you can use, um,
money from family.

1:00:32.655 --> 1:00:35.172
You can sell stuff
that you already own.

1:00:35.206 --> 1:00:38.724
Um, so there's lots of ways
that you can raise that money.

1:00:38.758 --> 1:00:42.379
I started hearing that women
were... were, following me

1:00:42.413 --> 1:00:45.862
<i>and they were waiting
for the next article
to come out.</i>

1:00:45.896 --> 1:00:48.862
<i>As I started getting
more popular in my blog,</i>

1:00:48.896 --> 1:00:49.965
<i>I was getting death threats.</i>

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.310
<i>People were showing
up on my doorstep.</i>

1:00:51.344 --> 1:00:52.758
<i>I was getting hate mail.</i>

1:00:52.793 --> 1:00:54.793
<i>I was not expecting</i>

1:00:54.827 --> 1:00:58.344
MommyGyver to become
as famous/infamous as it was.

1:01:01.137 --> 1:01:03.551
<i>So are you guys
blocking the trolls?</i>

1:01:03.586 --> 1:01:04.862
That would be awesome.

1:01:05.413 --> 1:01:06.689
Um, so make sure

1:01:06.724 --> 1:01:09.103
that you do because
it would make me so happy.

1:01:13.965 --> 1:01:17.241
<i>There were retailers
on every corner, you know.</i>

1:01:17.275 --> 1:01:20.034
I mean,
it was really highly doubtful
that we would all succeed.

1:01:22.241 --> 1:01:24.827
My next door neighbor
was a retailer

1:01:24.862 --> 1:01:25.896
in our apartment.

1:01:25.931 --> 1:01:28.068
<i>I was here.
She was here.</i>

1:01:28.103 --> 1:01:31.172
And it was crazy, we all both
had our LuLaRoe rooms.

1:01:32.206 --> 1:01:33.793
<i>Everywhere you turn,</i>

1:01:33.827 --> 1:01:36.275
<i>there was somebody,
I mean, you go to the mall,</i>

1:01:36.310 --> 1:01:38.448
<i>you run into somebody
selling LuLaRoe,</i>

1:01:38.482 --> 1:01:39.896
wearing it
or something like that.

1:01:43.586 --> 1:01:46.068
<i>I made about 60 grand</i>

1:01:46.103 --> 1:01:48.241
<i>in that first,
within that first year.</i>

1:01:48.275 --> 1:01:49.724
And I just took that money

1:01:49.758 --> 1:01:51.206
and just threw
it back in there.

1:01:51.241 --> 1:01:53.103
This dress
right here cost me.

1:01:53.137 --> 1:01:55.724
I paid $30 for this, $30.

1:01:55.758 --> 1:01:57.862
I'm lucky to get
probably $10 for it now.

1:01:58.724 --> 1:02:00.379
And at certain point,

1:02:00.413 --> 1:02:03.793
I was spending more than
I was bringing in.

1:02:03.827 --> 1:02:06.689
I have boxes
in that corner right there,

1:02:06.724 --> 1:02:09.965
and I have these pink bags
full of LuLaRoe.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.758
This is all left.
This is all what I have left.

1:02:14.137 --> 1:02:16.379
<i>I really had enough inventory.</i>

1:02:16.413 --> 1:02:17.620
<i>I really did,</i>

1:02:17.655 --> 1:02:19.965
<i>but I bought more things.</i>

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.896
That's what gets
you more in trouble.

1:02:21.931 --> 1:02:23.931
I was telling
somebody recently.

1:02:23.965 --> 1:02:25.827
If you wanna... what I paid,

1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:28.758
we're talking
at least 20 grand.

1:02:28.793 --> 1:02:30.862
Wow!
-$20,000 right here.

1:02:30.896 --> 1:02:33.482
Wow.
- 20,000, 25,000 right here.

1:02:36.172 --> 1:02:38.413
<i>Sales just started
to drop like almost</i>

1:02:38.448 --> 1:02:39.620
<i>half each month.</i>

1:02:39.655 --> 1:02:42.965
So, let's say June,
I did 16,000.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.448
<i>The next month
would have been,</i>

1:02:44.482 --> 1:02:45.896
<i>you know, 12,000,</i>

1:02:45.931 --> 1:02:49.413
<i>then 10,000,
then 8,000, then 4,000.</i>

1:02:49.448 --> 1:02:50.965
<i>And by January 2018</i>

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.793
<i>I only sold
a thousand dollars.</i>

1:02:53.827 --> 1:02:56.068
And I just felt I needed
to have new inventory.

1:02:56.103 --> 1:02:58.103
What I had was not selling.

1:02:58.137 --> 1:03:01.034
I can only create so many
outfits with what I had.

1:03:01.068 --> 1:03:04.068
So I actually took out loans

1:03:04.103 --> 1:03:05.758
to buy more inventory.

1:03:06.724 --> 1:03:07.965
<i>My house was</i>

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.034
<i>more LuLaRoe
than it was honestly house.</i>

1:03:11.068 --> 1:03:13.137
<i>Inventory all over
the front room</i>

1:03:13.172 --> 1:03:15.344
<i>and the sitting room
and the dining room.</i>

1:03:16.068 --> 1:03:17.758
Everywhere.

1:03:17.793 --> 1:03:20.000
<i>There's stuff
that goes on in our brains</i>

1:03:20.034 --> 1:03:22.310
<i>that is totally natural.</i>

1:03:22.344 --> 1:03:25.068
<i>They are defense mechanisms.
They keep us alive.</i>

1:03:25.103 --> 1:03:26.965
We all have this, um,

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000
cognitive bias
called loss aversion,

1:03:30.034 --> 1:03:32.379
which basically means

1:03:32.413 --> 1:03:34.379
that we feel losses

1:03:34.413 --> 1:03:36.379
a lot more deeply
and more strongly

1:03:36.413 --> 1:03:37.862
than we feel gains.

1:03:37.896 --> 1:03:39.379
There's a lot of tricks
we play on ourselves

1:03:39.413 --> 1:03:41.827
to like, not feel
like a loser.

1:03:41.862 --> 1:03:44.896
<i>There's another thing
called honoring sunk costs,</i>

1:03:44.931 --> 1:03:47.586
<i>and that is throwing
good money after bad.</i>

1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:49.482
<i>So, the more money
you put into your MLM,</i>

1:03:49.517 --> 1:03:51.620
<i>the more you're losing,
the more you're thinking,</i>

1:03:51.655 --> 1:03:53.034
<i>"It's an investment."</i>

1:03:53.068 --> 1:03:55.344
"I know I'm already
$10,000 in debt

1:03:55.379 --> 1:03:56.517
and my husband doesn't know,

1:03:56.551 --> 1:03:58.241
and our garage
is full of leggings,

1:03:58.275 --> 1:04:01.551
and I can't quit now.

1:04:01.586 --> 1:04:04.103
You know, I can't just
walk away
with that kind of debt.

1:04:04.137 --> 1:04:05.310
I have to keep trying."

1:04:05.344 --> 1:04:08.034
With LuLaRoe,
there's no safety net.

1:04:08.068 --> 1:04:10.137
There's nothing
to save you when your,

1:04:10.172 --> 1:04:11.758
when your business goes wrong,

1:04:11.793 --> 1:04:13.620
because you aren't a business.

1:04:13.655 --> 1:04:14.793
You're...

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.896
you're a retailer

1:04:18.655 --> 1:04:19.758
for another company.

1:04:19.793 --> 1:04:21.862
And if they fail,
they'll get protected.

1:04:21.896 --> 1:04:23.000
But you are ass out.

1:04:23.896 --> 1:04:25.793
Oh, my gosh,
there's so many large.

1:04:25.827 --> 1:04:29.620
1446, white with the black.

1:04:29.655 --> 1:04:32.137
<i>I was in a jam.
I couldn't pay
any of my bills.</i>

1:04:32.172 --> 1:04:33.448
<i>We were behind
on the house payment,</i>

1:04:34.137 --> 1:04:35.413
<i>plus we had 11 kids.</i>

1:04:35.448 --> 1:04:38.482
<i>So, it... it was just had
become desperation.</i>

1:04:38.517 --> 1:04:40.724
<i>I pretty much hit rock bottom
and said I can't.</i>

1:04:41.758 --> 1:04:42.931
I went live with my closet

1:04:43.517 --> 1:04:44.896
because I had so much,

1:04:45.310 --> 1:04:46.758
so much,

1:04:46.793 --> 1:04:48.793
and I still hadn't told
my customers yet.

1:04:49.655 --> 1:04:51.827
And I just held up this dress

1:04:51.862 --> 1:04:54.206
and I was like, "All right,
this is a sweater Carly,

1:04:54.241 --> 1:04:56.551
it's super rare,
it's a unicorn."

1:04:56.586 --> 1:04:58.448
Um, and then
I just start crying.

1:04:59.862 --> 1:05:02.310
<i>Once the tears started,
I couldn't get them to stop.</i>

1:05:04.068 --> 1:05:07.448
And I just told them,
you know, "This is it."

1:05:07.482 --> 1:05:09.206
<i>I already knew
I was gonna have to file</i>

1:05:09.241 --> 1:05:11.206
<i>for bankruptcy.
There is no way.</i>

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:14.034
I knew I owed
so much in taxes.

1:05:15.379 --> 1:05:17.206
This is where I go
to make my monthly

1:05:17.827 --> 1:05:18.827
bankruptcy payment,

1:05:19.310 --> 1:05:21.137
715 basically.

1:05:22.241 --> 1:05:24.034
I'm in a five-year bankruptcy,

1:05:24.068 --> 1:05:26.482
so overall I'll be paying

1:05:26.517 --> 1:05:28.206
a little over $40,000

1:05:28.241 --> 1:05:29.862
with all the fees
and everything.

1:05:29.896 --> 1:05:31.344
The lawyer fees and all.

1:05:33.517 --> 1:05:35.620
<i>I'll be honest
with you,
I thought about suicide</i>

1:05:35.655 --> 1:05:36.827
<i>when all this was happening,</i>

1:05:36.862 --> 1:05:39.448
<i>and just...
just to get out of that</i>

1:05:39.482 --> 1:05:41.310
after hitting rock bottom, so.

1:05:45.137 --> 1:05:46.103
I, um,

1:05:47.172 --> 1:05:49.103
have crazy anxiety now

1:05:49.137 --> 1:05:50.448
that I didn't have before.

1:05:50.482 --> 1:05:52.000
I felt like a failure.

1:05:52.034 --> 1:05:54.000
I put myself in debt,

1:05:54.034 --> 1:05:56.827
and I had no way
to pay it off.

1:05:56.862 --> 1:05:59.103
Still tens of thousands
in debt

1:05:59.137 --> 1:06:01.689
to this day that I still
haven't managed to pay off.

1:06:11.620 --> 1:06:13.896
<i>So you know the story
of Red Riding Hood,</i>

1:06:13.931 --> 1:06:15.310
<i>how she went
through the forest</i>

1:06:15.344 --> 1:06:16.379
<i>to visit her grandmother</i>

1:06:16.413 --> 1:06:19.586
and the wolf had eaten
her grandmother.

1:06:21.034 --> 1:06:23.000
<i>And the whole time
she's like, "Wow.</i>

1:06:24.413 --> 1:06:26.137
<i>Grandma, you're acting
kind of weird.</i>

1:06:26.172 --> 1:06:27.655
<i>Grandma, your nose
is a little different.</i>

1:06:28.724 --> 1:06:30.172
<i>Holy crap, grandma,
you're eating me.</i>

1:06:30.206 --> 1:06:31.724
You're not really grandma,
you're a wolf."

1:06:32.517 --> 1:06:33.862
That's what LuLaRoe was.

1:06:33.896 --> 1:06:35.551
It was innocuous,

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.827
<i>genuine, real,</i>

1:06:37.862 --> 1:06:41.137
<i>love, emotion, comfort.</i>

1:06:41.172 --> 1:06:43.551
"Just kidding.
We're gonna eat you alive."

1:06:44.586 --> 1:06:46.827
What happens to people
in MLMs,

1:06:46.862 --> 1:06:49.379
and I've done interventions
to get people out

1:06:49.413 --> 1:06:51.034
of multi-level marketing
schemes

1:06:51.586 --> 1:06:53.310
is they get hurt,

1:06:53.344 --> 1:06:55.068
and they could be bankrupted,

1:06:55.103 --> 1:06:57.655
their marriage could end,
they become estranged

1:06:57.689 --> 1:06:59.827
from family and old friends.

1:06:59.862 --> 1:07:02.103
People can be devastated.

1:07:02.137 --> 1:07:05.034
<i>I mean, how do you get people
to buy into something</i>

1:07:05.068 --> 1:07:07.413
<i>that is not in their own
best interest?</i>

1:07:07.448 --> 1:07:10.068
And the answer
is you manipulate them

1:07:10.103 --> 1:07:12.965
in a kind of cult-like manner.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.241
When I decided
it was no longer for me,

1:07:16.241 --> 1:07:18.413
everyone that was above me

1:07:18.448 --> 1:07:19.620
stopped talking to me.

1:07:19.655 --> 1:07:22.586
I didn't want my upline
to be mad that I was leaving

1:07:22.620 --> 1:07:24.896
because I know it would
affect their bonus checks.

1:07:24.931 --> 1:07:27.275
It was hard for me to let go.

1:07:27.310 --> 1:07:30.206
Um, it was hard for me
to admit failure.

1:07:32.068 --> 1:07:34.862
I've talked to ex-MLM sources

1:07:34.896 --> 1:07:37.241
who described
the process of leaving

1:07:37.275 --> 1:07:39.965
as psychological warfare,

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.103
who found that the moment
that they expressed

1:07:43.137 --> 1:07:44.413
that they didn't wanna
be involved

1:07:44.448 --> 1:07:45.862
with this group anymore,

1:07:45.896 --> 1:07:47.896
they were dropped like trash.

1:07:47.931 --> 1:07:49.482
That's the thing
that lets you know

1:07:49.517 --> 1:07:51.586
this is a destructive,
cultish group,

1:07:51.620 --> 1:07:53.620
when leaving comes

1:07:53.655 --> 1:07:56.620
with these major consequences.

1:07:58.275 --> 1:08:00.827
<i>I was never
making any money.</i>

1:08:00.862 --> 1:08:04.482
<i>I stuck it out as long
as I could, and fall of 18,</i>

1:08:04.517 --> 1:08:06.379
<i>that was it.</i>

1:08:06.413 --> 1:08:09.000
<i>I just kind of dropped off
the LuLaRoe world.</i>

1:08:10.413 --> 1:08:11.793
<i>Said, "I don't want
to do this anymore."</i>

1:08:12.965 --> 1:08:14.448
<i>And it's lonely</i>

1:08:14.482 --> 1:08:15.896
<i>when that happens to you,</i>

1:08:15.931 --> 1:08:17.655
<i>because you don't have
anything else in your life</i>

1:08:17.689 --> 1:08:19.103
<i>except for LuLaRoe,
and now you have</i>

1:08:19.137 --> 1:08:21.310
<i>to rebuild it all over again.</i>

1:08:21.344 --> 1:08:24.103
LuLaRoe convinced us
that we were in something,

1:08:24.137 --> 1:08:27.689
you know, super popular
and we were super important,

1:08:27.724 --> 1:08:28.965
and you just kind of

1:08:29.517 --> 1:08:31.965
fell into acting like it

1:08:32.724 --> 1:08:33.724
and believing it.

1:08:35.896 --> 1:08:40.000
<i>And that's why I look back
on it feeling so cultish.</i>

1:08:40.034 --> 1:08:42.310
You are not selling clothes.

1:08:42.344 --> 1:08:45.793
<i>You are giving people freedom,
you are giving people life,</i>

1:08:45.827 --> 1:08:46.931
you are giving people hope,

1:08:46.965 --> 1:08:48.965
you are giving
people confidence.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.620
<i>Is LuLaRoe a cult?</i>

1:08:50.655 --> 1:08:52.379
<i>I would have to say,</i>

1:08:54.413 --> 1:08:57.310
I just can't think
of anything else

1:08:57.344 --> 1:09:01.275
that makes people
quite that dedicated.

1:09:01.310 --> 1:09:02.827
Think about
all the great things.

1:09:02.862 --> 1:09:04.517
Think about
the positive things,

1:09:04.551 --> 1:09:05.931
not the negative things.

1:09:05.965 --> 1:09:07.931
I would be up until
four o'clock in the morning,

1:09:07.965 --> 1:09:09.034
almost every night.

1:09:09.068 --> 1:09:11.586
My kids saw way less of me
after I started.

1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.413
I don't think I ever slept.

1:09:13.448 --> 1:09:15.103
<i>There's no
work-life balance.</i>

1:09:15.137 --> 1:09:17.379
<i>You know, you're putting
all of your finances into it.</i>

1:09:17.413 --> 1:09:19.724
<i>You've alienated
your friends and family.</i>

1:09:19.758 --> 1:09:21.586
I just can't think
of anything else

1:09:22.241 --> 1:09:24.379
to call it.

1:09:24.413 --> 1:09:27.620
<i>When I left,
I was a mess.
I was a hot mess.</i>

1:09:27.655 --> 1:09:29.862
<i>I was in hook,
line and sinker.</i>

1:09:29.896 --> 1:09:32.241
<i>I believed all of it,
and I don't think</i>

1:09:32.275 --> 1:09:33.896
<i>that they went into it</i>

1:09:33.931 --> 1:09:36.103
<i>to create it to be a cult.</i>

1:09:36.137 --> 1:09:38.206
But from my experience,
it was.

1:09:39.793 --> 1:09:41.413
Especially when I went to leave.

1:09:42.724 --> 1:09:44.172
<i>That was a struggle.</i>

1:09:44.206 --> 1:09:45.827
<i>You quickly learned
who your friends were</i>

1:09:45.862 --> 1:09:46.931
<i>and who they weren't.</i>

1:09:48.793 --> 1:09:50.206
<i>They had no need
for me anymore.</i>

1:09:51.931 --> 1:09:53.379
Looking back on it now, I'm...

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:56.758
I'm shocked that I

1:09:56.793 --> 1:09:58.758
drank that much Kool-Aid.

1:09:58.793 --> 1:10:01.275
You're basically, like, marked
as a suppressive person

1:10:01.310 --> 1:10:03.517
and you're hurting
their business by leaving

1:10:03.551 --> 1:10:05.275
and by telling your truth.

1:10:05.310 --> 1:10:07.379
So I just shut up and I left

1:10:07.413 --> 1:10:09.620
and I refused to talk
about it until now.

1:10:09.655 --> 1:10:12.034
I literally didn't know
what to do with myself,

1:10:12.068 --> 1:10:13.896
because it was my identity.

1:10:13.931 --> 1:10:16.241
The mentality in there
is always positive,

1:10:16.275 --> 1:10:17.827
nothing negative,

1:10:17.862 --> 1:10:21.551
and you're
in a LuLaRoe family.

1:10:21.586 --> 1:10:22.620
So you have your LuLa mom,

1:10:22.655 --> 1:10:25.068
your LuLa grandma,
your LuLa babies.

1:10:25.103 --> 1:10:27.344
Everything is Lula
In LuLaRoe.

1:10:30.448 --> 1:10:31.896
<i>MLMs are scammy,</i>

1:10:31.931 --> 1:10:34.551
but they are not
just your average scam.

1:10:35.758 --> 1:10:38.172
<i>They have so much in common</i>

1:10:38.206 --> 1:10:39.793
<i>psychologically with the groups</i>

1:10:39.827 --> 1:10:42.344
<i>that we would traditionally
think of as cults.</i>

1:10:42.379 --> 1:10:45.551
<i>You know, they encourage you
to recruit others.</i>

1:10:45.586 --> 1:10:48.448
They shut down
questioning and dissent.

1:10:48.482 --> 1:10:50.103
<i>They gaslight you
into thinking</i>

1:10:50.137 --> 1:10:52.931
<i>that if you don't succeed
in this organization,</i>

1:10:52.965 --> 1:10:54.344
<i>it is your fault.</i>

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.172
<i>If you don't make
your quota for the month,</i>

1:10:56.206 --> 1:10:59.103
well, girl, it's because you
didn't think positive enough.

1:10:59.137 --> 1:11:01.482
You didn't envision
the Cadillac.

1:11:01.517 --> 1:11:02.517
Therefore,

1:11:03.517 --> 1:11:04.689
there is something
wrong with you.

1:11:05.793 --> 1:11:07.724
You need to stick
it out another month

1:11:07.758 --> 1:11:09.241
to really prove yourself

1:11:09.275 --> 1:11:11.413
as the boss babe
we thought you were.

1:11:11.448 --> 1:11:13.931
I just felt like a failure
and I didn't wanna

1:11:14.793 --> 1:11:17.000
go to my mom
and after she gave me

1:11:17.034 --> 1:11:19.655
<i>that money from her
retirement fund,</i>

1:11:19.689 --> 1:11:21.241
like I didn't want
to go to her

1:11:21.275 --> 1:11:22.586
and be like, "Mom,
I failed."

1:11:23.517 --> 1:11:27.068
So, I just, I was in denial
a long time,

1:11:27.103 --> 1:11:29.241
and I just

1:11:29.275 --> 1:11:31.862
really just had
to face the truth.

1:11:31.896 --> 1:11:34.000
<i>It's really hard to see
yourself as a victim.</i>

1:11:34.931 --> 1:11:36.620
<i>To say you were victimized</i>

1:11:36.655 --> 1:11:38.586
is to admit a weakness,

1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:41.103
and a weakness feels painful.

1:11:41.137 --> 1:11:43.896
Plus, if you admit
that you were victimized,

1:11:43.931 --> 1:11:45.758
then you also have
to, in an MLM,

1:11:45.793 --> 1:11:47.344
admit that you
victimized others,

1:11:47.931 --> 1:11:49.517
which is even harder.

1:11:49.551 --> 1:11:51.310
<i>I just felt
extremely guilty</i>

1:11:51.344 --> 1:11:52.344
<i>for the people that I,</i>

1:11:53.655 --> 1:11:54.655
<i>you know, had join.</i>

1:11:56.517 --> 1:12:00.758
So, I just, I always think
about that, I always
wonder like, how do they

1:12:00.793 --> 1:12:03.034
think of me,
like I had such highs

1:12:03.068 --> 1:12:04.413
and then I had such lows.

1:12:04.448 --> 1:12:08.137
And I think about that now,
like, what do they
think of me now

1:12:08.172 --> 1:12:10.517
or did they think I was being
deceitful at the time.

1:12:11.862 --> 1:12:14.206
<i>So, while
a LuLaRoe recruit</i>

1:12:14.241 --> 1:12:16.034
<i>might be a suburban mom</i>

1:12:16.068 --> 1:12:18.310
<i>with highlights
wearing bulldog leggings</i>

1:12:18.344 --> 1:12:21.206
rather than
a new religious member

1:12:21.241 --> 1:12:24.379
in a white robe
with a shaved head
on a commune,

1:12:24.413 --> 1:12:27.655
the methods of manipulation
that they're under
are quite similar.

1:12:31.172 --> 1:12:33.689
We were supposed to dress
a certain way all the time.

1:12:38.103 --> 1:12:40.206
<i>If it was too big,
we would tie a knot in it,</i>

1:12:41.172 --> 1:12:42.586
<i>mix our patterns,</i>

1:12:43.896 --> 1:12:46.068
<i>then we all wore it,</i>

1:12:46.103 --> 1:12:47.586
<i>and we all wore
the same thing,</i>

1:12:49.275 --> 1:12:50.310
acted the same way.

1:12:51.689 --> 1:12:54.310
<i>So like
being on stage
and looking out</i>

1:12:54.344 --> 1:12:55.517
<i>into the audience.</i>

1:12:55.551 --> 1:12:58.034
Um, everybody was twins.

1:12:58.068 --> 1:13:00.517
I'm not going to lie, like
everybody had that Joy on.

1:13:00.551 --> 1:13:02.275
How am I remembering
all these names?

1:13:02.310 --> 1:13:05.379
It's like the cardigan,
the long.

1:13:05.413 --> 1:13:07.448
<i>And then everyone
was rocking leggings.</i>

1:13:08.517 --> 1:13:12.034
Oh, my gosh. Wow!
What a morning.

1:13:12.068 --> 1:13:13.413
<i>I can't imagine
what that must</i>

1:13:13.448 --> 1:13:16.000
<i>have been like for DeAnne,</i>

1:13:16.034 --> 1:13:19.275
<i>to look out and see everybody
that you've convinced</i>

1:13:19.310 --> 1:13:20.620
<i>to be a certain way.</i>

1:13:20.655 --> 1:13:22.655
<i>What that would feel like?</i>

1:13:22.689 --> 1:13:24.551
I've always just
kind of always wondered

1:13:24.586 --> 1:13:26.034
what did she really think.

1:13:27.172 --> 1:13:29.827
<i>They need
that culture of conformity</i>

1:13:29.862 --> 1:13:32.482
<i>where you're only hearing
the MLM rhetoric,</i>

1:13:32.517 --> 1:13:34.137
<i>where you're only hearing</i>

1:13:34.172 --> 1:13:36.586
<i>that toxic positivity
from your upline,</i>

1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:38.758
where you're only
hearing the mantras

1:13:38.793 --> 1:13:41.448
and the faux inspiration
from the people at the top,

1:13:41.482 --> 1:13:43.000
it creates the sense that

1:13:43.034 --> 1:13:45.413
you're a part of something
bigger than yourself.

1:13:45.448 --> 1:13:48.758
And I want to tell you
there is a sense of belonging.

1:13:48.793 --> 1:13:52.758
I think there is a specific
group of people
that they're targeting

1:13:52.793 --> 1:13:55.448
and it's middle-aged
white women in Middle America.

1:13:56.448 --> 1:13:58.413
<i>But they probably
do have sprinklings of,</i>

1:13:58.448 --> 1:14:00.310
<i>you know, a Latina,
a black woman,</i>

1:14:00.344 --> 1:14:01.655
<i>uh, you know, an Asian</i>

1:14:01.689 --> 1:14:04.344
<i>just to, you know, bring some
diversity, some seasoning.</i>

1:14:04.379 --> 1:14:06.862
But, um, they use
a lot of black vernacular

1:14:06.896 --> 1:14:10.448
in order to, um,
to look relatable.

1:14:11.034 --> 1:14:12.517
Hey, girls. Hey!

1:14:12.551 --> 1:14:15.517
Hey, girl, hey. Hello, hello,
everyone, welcome.

1:14:15.551 --> 1:14:17.379
- Hey!
- Which is fine.

1:14:17.413 --> 1:14:19.448
That's fine if you wanna use
black vernacular.

1:14:19.482 --> 1:14:21.310
<i>I'm not the vernacular police,</i>

1:14:21.344 --> 1:14:24.000
but it's not reflected
in their downline.

1:14:24.034 --> 1:14:25.551
It's not reflected
on their stages

1:14:25.586 --> 1:14:27.206
when they hold
these major events.

1:14:27.241 --> 1:14:29.137
<i>I have a problem
with it because</i>

1:14:29.172 --> 1:14:31.620
<i>they're using
the Black vernacular
to profit,</i>

1:14:31.655 --> 1:14:34.103
but we're not profiting
off of it because

1:14:35.034 --> 1:14:36.862
we're only there
for seasoning

1:14:36.896 --> 1:14:38.689
so that they can tell,

1:14:38.724 --> 1:14:40.482
the world,
"Yes, we're diverse."

1:14:43.379 --> 1:14:44.379
Okay.

1:14:45.517 --> 1:14:47.793
- Is that it?
Yes.

1:14:47.827 --> 1:14:51.172
That really struck me
when I would sell my product,

1:14:51.206 --> 1:14:52.965
um, Black people
would never...

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.206
I would... that would shut,
they would shut the door
in my face, yeah.

1:14:56.241 --> 1:14:58.344
I promise you, I promise you.

1:14:58.379 --> 1:15:02.275
And I have neighbors, people,
church, family, friends.

1:15:02.310 --> 1:15:06.896
<i>My daughter said the clothing
wasn't their style.</i>

1:15:06.931 --> 1:15:08.896
I guess they didn't like
the clothing.

1:15:08.931 --> 1:15:10.000
<i>I would say</i>

1:15:10.034 --> 1:15:13.620
<i>95% of these women were white.</i>

1:15:13.655 --> 1:15:18.068
I have only seen a few people
of color ever

1:15:18.103 --> 1:15:20.517
who were a part of LuLaRoe,

1:15:20.551 --> 1:15:25.068
<i>and all the main figures
who are very popular</i>

1:15:25.103 --> 1:15:28.724
<i>and high up in LuLaRoe were
always very homogeneous.</i>

1:15:30.413 --> 1:15:33.241
<i>Mark and DeAnne were
projecting a certain image,</i>

1:15:33.275 --> 1:15:35.793
<i>an image of a white couple.</i>

1:15:36.448 --> 1:15:37.896
When you have a group

1:15:37.931 --> 1:15:40.586
than has that kind
of leadership

1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:44.103
<i>that represents a...
a kind of prototype,</i>

1:15:44.137 --> 1:15:47.758
they encourage you to want
to be just like the leaders.

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:50.000
What's up, y'all?
We're here.

1:15:50.034 --> 1:15:52.793
This is 2016,
New York convention.

1:15:52.827 --> 1:15:56.034
It's getting live,
it's getting lit.
There's a bunch of ladies

1:15:56.068 --> 1:15:59.689
in leggings and dresses
and leggings and dresses.

1:15:59.724 --> 1:16:02.310
Did I mention
that they're in leggings?

1:16:05.379 --> 1:16:07.689
Being Black at LuLaRoe

1:16:09.413 --> 1:16:10.620
was great.

1:16:10.655 --> 1:16:12.793
I was the unicorn Of LuLaRoe,

1:16:12.827 --> 1:16:14.310
you best believe.

1:16:14.344 --> 1:16:16.931
<i>I rode that train,</i>

1:16:16.965 --> 1:16:19.620
I mean, I tooted my horn
and everything because

1:16:19.655 --> 1:16:21.931
I mean, yeah, they...

1:16:21.965 --> 1:16:24.482
It wasn't diverse at all.

1:16:24.517 --> 1:16:26.551
I mean, in a serious,

1:16:26.586 --> 1:16:28.068
on a serious side, like...

1:16:30.275 --> 1:16:31.862
I don't know if I could
say like...

1:16:36.793 --> 1:16:39.310
I may have could have gotten
taken advantage of...

1:16:40.379 --> 1:16:41.896
...a few times,

1:16:41.931 --> 1:16:46.275
like I definitely
endured some...

1:16:46.310 --> 1:16:48.793
some racism I'm not,
I'm not going to lie.

1:16:48.827 --> 1:16:52.172
But again, for me...

1:16:54.344 --> 1:16:55.620
I'll put up with it.

1:16:55.655 --> 1:16:58.310
I'm where I wanted to be...

1:16:58.344 --> 1:17:00.413
I'm living my dream, you know,

1:17:00.448 --> 1:17:04.586
and I've dealt with it
in my life.

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:07.413
You know, this is,
it's nothing new.

1:17:07.448 --> 1:17:09.482
<i>It's going to be everywhere
you go.</i>

1:17:09.517 --> 1:17:12.034
Like, there's always
somebody that hates you.

1:17:22.137 --> 1:17:25.655
<i>I was so grateful
for the opportunity just
to be there.</i>

1:17:25.689 --> 1:17:27.551
They incorporated me
in their family.

1:17:27.586 --> 1:17:30.724
They let me come
to the cookouts.

1:17:30.758 --> 1:17:32.034
<i>I was in.</i>

1:17:33.758 --> 1:17:34.793
And I'm just like,

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.068
"I'm this nobody from Concord,
like, I mean..."

1:17:41.103 --> 1:17:47.931
I was thinking, "Yeah, I want
to do this for the rest
of my life."

1:17:49.620 --> 1:17:52.068

<i>fun activities,</i>

1:18:08.827 --> 1:18:10.137
ran by Sam Schultz.

1:18:12.241 --> 1:18:15.965
<i>Sam Schultz is DeAnne's
direct nephew.</i>

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.344
<i>Sam was right at the top
of LuLaRoe</i>

1:18:19.551 --> 1:18:22.034
and was really the LuLaRoe
hype man.

1:18:22.068 --> 1:18:25.103
It was actually Sam Schultz
who came and approached me

1:18:25.137 --> 1:18:26.965
<i>at that beach.</i>

1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.655
He was the reason
why I was there.

1:18:30.344 --> 1:18:32.655
Elijah! Elijah! Elijah!

1:18:36.137 --> 1:18:40.655
I related to Sam,
like he was kind of my idol.

1:18:40.689 --> 1:18:43.103
<i>He was my big brother.</i>

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:45.000
Ha-ha!

1:18:45.034 --> 1:18:48.931
- Yo, what up, y'all?
- Look, it's a Monday.

1:18:48.965 --> 1:18:51.172
- Back to work.
- Hey!

1:18:51.206 --> 1:18:52.793
<i>I would do
anything for Sam.</i>

1:18:53.482 --> 1:18:56.000
I felt in debt to him.

1:18:56.034 --> 1:18:59.172
<i>The first time
I met Sam Shultz was
at a LuLaRoe training,</i>

1:18:59.206 --> 1:19:01.724
and they will ask you
what your "why" is.

1:19:01.758 --> 1:19:04.068
Can you guys see me okay?

1:19:04.103 --> 1:19:07.034
Let's see, I felt like
this is like
an interrogation light.

1:19:07.068 --> 1:19:10.517
<i>He's very,
very good
at getting close to you</i>

1:19:10.551 --> 1:19:11.793
<i>and listening to your story.</i>

1:19:12.724 --> 1:19:13.862
What's up, everyone?

1:19:13.896 --> 1:19:15.413
It feels nice to have somebody

1:19:16.103 --> 1:19:18.034
kind of ask you those.

1:19:18.068 --> 1:19:19.551
Why do you...
Why do you do
what you do?

1:19:20.275 --> 1:19:21.275
<i>I told my why.</i>

1:19:22.827 --> 1:19:26.586
My husband had passed
in December of 2012.

1:19:31.896 --> 1:19:34.620
<i>There were
times shortly
after Scott passed</i>

1:19:34.655 --> 1:19:38.965
<i>that I really probably
didn't deserve to have my son.</i>

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.068
Which might not be
the best thing
for any mom to ever say.

1:19:44.068 --> 1:19:47.620
<i>Just self-medicated,
slept a lot.</i>

1:19:49.724 --> 1:19:50.724
<i>It was bad.</i>

1:19:53.620 --> 1:19:56.034
<i>And I told him that story,</i>

1:19:56.068 --> 1:19:59.862
<i>and I think right
then and there, right then,</i>

1:20:01.413 --> 1:20:02.517
I was the target.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:09.413
Because he knew the guilt
that I carried from the years

1:20:09.448 --> 1:20:11.206
immediately after
my husband passed.

1:20:11.241 --> 1:20:14.620
He chose close people
and groomed them for a while,

1:20:15.586 --> 1:20:16.793
<i>so he would get away with it.</i>

1:20:17.655 --> 1:20:19.172
<i>So we wouldn't turn on him.</i>

1:20:20.551 --> 1:20:22.551
<i>I called him my best friend</i>

1:20:22.586 --> 1:20:24.517
<i>'cause I did think
he was my best friend.</i>

1:20:24.551 --> 1:20:25.620
And so did my son.

1:20:26.896 --> 1:20:29.137
<i>He loved him.</i>

1:20:29.172 --> 1:20:32.586
When you are brought up
in a household
that literally worships

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.896
the church of MLM,

1:20:34.931 --> 1:20:38.896
<i>all you know is how
to worship the church of MLM.</i>

1:20:45.724 --> 1:20:48.206
<i>Sam kind of
encouraged us to,</i>

1:20:48.241 --> 1:20:49.793
<i>"All right, come on,
let's do our own thing.</i>

1:20:49.827 --> 1:20:52.275
<i>It's... we're going to start
our own thing."</i>

1:20:52.310 --> 1:20:54.689
I trusted him, you know.

1:20:55.931 --> 1:20:58.000
And I quit, I quit LuLaRoe.

1:20:58.586 --> 1:20:59.793
I did.

1:21:03.965 --> 1:21:05.137
I was naive.

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.068
I learned that Sam

1:21:11.103 --> 1:21:15.482
was in and out
of various schemes,

1:21:15.517 --> 1:21:18.689
plots, get rich quick ideas,
whatever you want
to call them.

1:21:18.724 --> 1:21:21.206
The Utah County musician,
who makes a living

1:21:21.241 --> 1:21:24.827
organizing concerts
and once owned the popular
Sammy's Cafe,

1:21:24.862 --> 1:21:27.034
is now facing
26 felonies tonight.

1:21:27.068 --> 1:21:29.482
<i>In all charging
documents say Schultz
recruited</i>

1:21:29.517 --> 1:21:31.344
<i>at least 13 investors,</i>

1:21:31.379 --> 1:21:35.103
<i>who collectively gave Schultz
$323,000.</i>

1:21:36.655 --> 1:21:39.655
<i>There was a medicinal
marijuana farm.</i>

1:21:39.689 --> 1:21:41.275
<i>You know, he wanted
more money from me</i>

1:21:41.310 --> 1:21:43.586
<i>for these fake investment
opportunities.</i>

1:21:43.931 --> 1:21:44.931
In total,

1:21:46.034 --> 1:21:51.344
Sam managed to get from me
almost $100,000,

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.655
<i>and the majority of that
money was money left
by my late husband,</i>

1:21:58.689 --> 1:22:00.137
<i>allocated to Peirson.</i>

1:22:06.413 --> 1:22:08.482
<i>People will say
to me with
the current business,</i>

1:22:09.517 --> 1:22:11.827
<i>"Oh, my gosh,
you worked so hard.</i>

1:22:11.862 --> 1:22:14.482
<i>You worked, I can't believe
you do all this by yourself."</i>

1:22:15.413 --> 1:22:16.931
<i>They don't know
the real reason</i>

1:22:16.965 --> 1:22:20.068
why I do all of it by myself
is because in my head,

1:22:21.448 --> 1:22:24.000
every time the Airstream
door opens,

1:22:24.034 --> 1:22:27.137
I'm constantly trying
to make up for what I lost.

1:22:47.275 --> 1:22:49.517
Me, like so many others

1:22:50.965 --> 1:22:54.379
of his victims, were plucked
right out of that company.

1:22:54.413 --> 1:22:55.758
But you know what?
The company won't

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:58.655
take any responsibility
for it.

1:23:04.517 --> 1:23:06.896
2017 was the big year

1:23:06.931 --> 1:23:09.103
where they got
a ton of lawsuits
filed against them

1:23:09.137 --> 1:23:11.724
and the backlash against them
really started.

1:23:18.965 --> 1:23:20.931
<i>I think there was really
power in numbers,</i>

1:23:20.965 --> 1:23:24.000
<i>and once people all started
getting together and talking
about this stuff,</i>

1:23:24.034 --> 1:23:26.379
<i>you know, I think
more lawsuits were filed.</i>

1:23:26.413 --> 1:23:29.206
<i>I think people started
reaching out to the media.</i>

1:23:29.241 --> 1:23:30.965
And I think ultimately,

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.068
it started giving
the case attention.

1:23:35.103 --> 1:23:36.896
Three Sacramento women
are suing

1:23:36.931 --> 1:23:41.241
a popular clothing company
called LuLaRoe for $1 billion.

1:23:41.275 --> 1:23:42.655
<i>The attorney claims
the company</i>

1:23:42.689 --> 1:23:44.379
<i>has cheated
thousands of women.</i>

1:23:59.206 --> 1:24:02.103
<i>I'm a fourth generation
steamfitter of Local UA342.</i>

1:24:04.482 --> 1:24:06.965
I'm known
in the LuLaRoe Defective

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.896
Defectors' Support Group
as Heather Blithely.

1:24:09.931 --> 1:24:12.137
<i>My legal name, however,
is Heather Blevins.</i>

1:24:12.172 --> 1:24:16.310
I try to keep my online
social media presence

1:24:16.344 --> 1:24:19.620
and my real life self
kind of separate.

1:24:21.551 --> 1:24:23.137
<i>I don't know
why I wanted to help so bad.</i>

1:24:23.172 --> 1:24:24.655
<i>I really don't.</i>

1:24:24.689 --> 1:24:26.793
<i>It just wasn't fair,
and no one was listening.</i>

1:24:26.827 --> 1:24:28.310
And everyone was telling us
we were wrong

1:24:28.344 --> 1:24:30.517
for trying to help
and we were wrong for caring

1:24:30.551 --> 1:24:35.689
and we just knew...
that it was real.

1:24:42.068 --> 1:24:44.689
<i>I think that
the Facebook group
is one of the reasons</i>

1:24:44.724 --> 1:24:48.137
why I have always known
this is a story
that's worth reporting

1:24:48.172 --> 1:24:50.482
because people were

1:24:50.517 --> 1:24:53.275
so incredibly passionate
about it.

1:24:53.310 --> 1:24:55.137
<i>I wasn't really sure</i>

1:24:56.586 --> 1:24:59.689
how to go about
telling you guys.

1:24:59.724 --> 1:25:01.931
<i>And just
really want
to see</i>

1:25:01.965 --> 1:25:04.793
<i>justice in some form
or another.</i>

1:25:04.827 --> 1:25:07.034
<i>When I first joined
LuLaRoe Defective,</i>

1:25:07.068 --> 1:25:08.241
<i>it was pretty small</i>

1:25:08.275 --> 1:25:10.206
<i>and I volunteered.</i>

1:25:10.241 --> 1:25:14.103
As consultants started
mass leaving LuLaRoe,

1:25:14.137 --> 1:25:17.931
<i>there wasn't any place
for us to say,</i>

1:25:17.965 --> 1:25:20.000
"Here's what really happened
behind the scenes."

1:25:21.103 --> 1:25:22.758
<i>So, it's like a domino effect,
right?</i>

1:25:22.793 --> 1:25:26.344
You get one person
who just is not happy

1:25:26.379 --> 1:25:29.689
and they decide to say
something and then
it's like, boom.

1:25:29.724 --> 1:25:31.827
The... the door gets
kicked down.

1:25:31.862 --> 1:25:33.517
It's like, me too, me too.

1:25:33.551 --> 1:25:34.862
<i>This happened to me too.</i>

1:25:36.275 --> 1:25:39.172
The membership grew
pretty steadily,

1:25:39.206 --> 1:25:42.241
<i>um, from a few hundred
to a couple of thousand,</i>

1:25:42.275 --> 1:25:44.000
<i>and at the height
of the group,</i>

1:25:44.034 --> 1:25:46.000
<i>there were 75,000 members.</i>

1:25:48.137 --> 1:25:51.275
<i>Heather is
one of my good friends now,</i>

1:25:51.310 --> 1:25:53.896
and she's a damn good
detective as well.

1:25:53.931 --> 1:25:56.896
I can say that.

1:25:56.931 --> 1:25:59.586
<i>It was brought
to our attention by some
of the members</i>

1:25:59.620 --> 1:26:04.275
<i>how a lot of their
onboarding packages
had ads that advertised</i>

1:26:04.310 --> 1:26:05.931
<i>full-time pay
for part-time work.</i>

1:26:05.965 --> 1:26:09.655
$60,000 to $75,000 a year,

1:26:09.689 --> 1:26:12.000
working 20 hours a week.

1:26:14.482 --> 1:26:16.655
<i>There was
a trend of burning your
onboarding package.</i>

1:26:16.689 --> 1:26:18.862
<i>When people would cancel,
they were just so excited
to get out</i>

1:26:18.896 --> 1:26:20.482
<i>that they would burn
their onboarding package,</i>

1:26:20.517 --> 1:26:23.068
<i>and I realized that
evidence is being lost.</i>

1:26:23.103 --> 1:26:25.931
<i>And so I went and got
a post office box</i>

1:26:25.965 --> 1:26:28.517
<i>and asked the group for
their onboarding packages.</i>

1:26:31.931 --> 1:26:33.275
<i>We encouraged everyone,</i>

1:26:33.310 --> 1:26:35.827
<i>"File a complaint with
your state's
attorney general,"</i>

1:26:35.862 --> 1:26:37.551
<i>and all we could
do is hope that</i>

1:26:37.586 --> 1:26:39.517
<i>someone was going to pay
attention and someone
was going to take interest.</i>

1:26:40.517 --> 1:26:44.000
Finally, I got a message

1:26:44.034 --> 1:26:47.586
from the investigators
of the Washington State
Attorney General's Office,

1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:50.413
<i>and she was asking if I had
any information about</i>

1:26:50.448 --> 1:26:53.172
which consultants
in Washington were impacted.

1:26:53.206 --> 1:26:55.517
<i>One thing I sent to them
was the brochure</i>

1:26:55.551 --> 1:26:56.862
<i>that came
in the onboarding package</i>

1:26:56.896 --> 1:26:59.275
<i>that said you could make
full-time work
for part-time pay.</i>

1:26:59.310 --> 1:27:02.862
Oh, and the video of Jordan
and Lindsay Wheeler,
who's a top consultant.

1:27:02.896 --> 1:27:06.068
We need to get away
from being
a pyramid scheme, okay?

1:27:06.103 --> 1:27:08.862
What it is is if you
sign up Sally,

1:27:09.862 --> 1:27:13.206
you have, you have no reason
to help Sally

1:27:13.241 --> 1:27:15.586
sell the product in her room.

1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:19.344
Right? You can just keep
promoting her to buy, to buy,
to buy, to buy.

1:27:19.379 --> 1:27:22.620
- You could even...
<i>And they were
explaining</i>

1:27:22.655 --> 1:27:23.724
a pretty big policy change.

1:27:23.758 --> 1:27:25.034
I'm not panicked
at all, right?

1:27:25.068 --> 1:27:26.655
If you're doing
the right things,

1:27:26.689 --> 1:27:27.896
there's no issue.

1:27:27.931 --> 1:27:29.689
When the LuLaRoe
first started,

1:27:29.724 --> 1:27:31.551
if you had people under you,

1:27:31.586 --> 1:27:35.206
you weren't making
a percentage of the clothing
they sold.

1:27:35.241 --> 1:27:38.310
You're making a percentage
of the clothing they bought.

1:27:38.344 --> 1:27:40.413
<i>So for example,
I'm in LuLaRoe.</i>

1:27:40.448 --> 1:27:42.586
<i>I have a girl under me,
let's say.</i>

1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:45.965
<i>If she buys ten shirts
and she can only sell two,</i>

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.241
<i>it doesn't really
matter to me.</i>

1:27:47.275 --> 1:27:50.206
<i>I'm making commission
off all ten shirts.</i>

1:27:50.241 --> 1:27:52.620
<i>And then eventually
LuLaRoe changed</i>

1:27:52.655 --> 1:27:55.931
<i>their structure for bonuses,</i>

1:27:55.965 --> 1:28:03.068
<i>where instead I was gonna
make only money
of the shirts she sold.</i>

1:28:03.103 --> 1:28:07.379
<i>So instead of making money
for ten shirts, I was looking
at making money for two.</i>

1:28:07.413 --> 1:28:10.310
All of the sudden,
people's, um,

1:28:10.344 --> 1:28:12.413
income was dropping
precipitously.

1:28:12.448 --> 1:28:13.931
I mean, we've been talking
about it forever.

1:28:13.965 --> 1:28:15.379
If you've come
to a leadership.

1:28:15.413 --> 1:28:17.206
<i>Yeah, this
is not new.</i>

1:28:17.241 --> 1:28:18.310
Yeah, this is not new.

1:28:18.344 --> 1:28:20.379
This is something that
we've been talking about.

1:28:20.413 --> 1:28:23.137
Lindsay, what do you say
to people when

1:28:23.172 --> 1:28:25.586
they say we are a pyramid
scheme?

1:28:26.172 --> 1:28:27.551
Quick answer.

1:28:27.586 --> 1:28:28.724
We're not a pyramid scheme.

1:28:28.758 --> 1:28:30.137
My husband thought we were
at first.

1:28:30.172 --> 1:28:32.413
He told me I was gonna
share a cell with
Bernie Madoff

1:28:32.448 --> 1:28:34.275
'cause he was convinced
that there was no way

1:28:34.310 --> 1:28:36.896
that I could make this
kind of money doing
something legally.

1:28:36.931 --> 1:28:39.137
That's my favorite piece
of evidence that
I've ever seen.

1:28:40.310 --> 1:28:42.137
And again, that was sent
to me by a consultant.

1:28:42.172 --> 1:28:45.206
<i>You've
probably seen their brightly
colored tops and leggings</i>

1:28:45.241 --> 1:28:47.103
<i>on your social media feed.</i>

1:28:47.137 --> 1:28:50.655
<i>But tonight, the company
LuLaRoe facing
another lawsuit.</i>

1:28:50.689 --> 1:28:53.724
<i>The Washington State
Attorney General says LuLaRoe</i>

1:28:53.758 --> 1:28:56.379
<i>made claims of high profits
and tricked people</i>

1:28:56.413 --> 1:28:58.068
<i>into joining a pyramid scheme.</i>

1:28:58.103 --> 1:29:01.103
<i>So, what makes LuLaRoe
a pyramid scheme,</i>

1:29:01.137 --> 1:29:02.827
according to the Attorney
General's office?

1:29:02.862 --> 1:29:07.103
Well, the monthly bonuses,
which were reportedly
seven to 12 times higher

1:29:07.137 --> 1:29:08.965
<i>than the actual
merchandise sales.</i>

1:29:12.586 --> 1:29:15.793
<i>Do you ever
encourage retailers to share
how much they made,</i>

1:29:15.827 --> 1:29:17.827
<i>um, in a particular
bonus check?</i>

1:29:17.862 --> 1:29:19.379
No. 121.

1:29:19.413 --> 1:29:21.206
So, exhibit 121.

1:29:21.241 --> 1:29:22.896
<i>So I'm gonna
start playing at...</i>

1:29:22.931 --> 1:29:26.034
<i>at the beginning
and play for a little bit.</i>

1:29:26.068 --> 1:29:28.793
<i>I am from Maryland.</i>

1:29:28.827 --> 1:29:32.206
<i>My... my last check
was $250,000,</i>

1:29:32.241 --> 1:29:36.034
<i>and I do about
12,000 to 13,000 in sales
every month.</i>

1:29:37.586 --> 1:29:40.034
<i>I'm in Salt Lake City...
Riverton, Utah,</i>

1:29:40.068 --> 1:29:43.655
<i>and our last check
was 307,000.</i>

1:29:46.206 --> 1:29:49.344
<i>I... I can't even say it.
It, like, blows my mind.</i>

1:29:49.379 --> 1:29:51.689
<i>So, uh, correct me
if I'm wrong,</i>

1:29:51.724 --> 1:29:54.000
<i>but everyone in that video
is making more</i>

1:29:54.034 --> 1:29:56.000
<i>in bonus checks than
they are in sales, correct?</i>

1:29:56.862 --> 1:29:58.517
At that time, yes.

1:29:58.551 --> 1:30:00.793
<i>Why were
they making more
on bonus checks than sales?</i>

1:30:00.827 --> 1:30:02.034
I don't know. Maybe they...

1:30:03.310 --> 1:30:04.896
maybe they helped
a lot of people

1:30:06.551 --> 1:30:08.344
to help them make money.

1:30:42.517 --> 1:30:45.551
<i>When we heard
about the outcome
of the Washington State case,</i>

1:30:45.586 --> 1:30:47.517
<i>we were all definitely elated.</i>

1:31:02.103 --> 1:31:03.241
<i>We were super excited</i>

1:31:03.275 --> 1:31:04.517
<i>that the consultants
got money back.</i>

1:31:04.551 --> 1:31:06.586
It really, I think,
gave us hope

1:31:06.620 --> 1:31:09.206
that, um, what we were doing
was counting for something.

1:31:09.241 --> 1:31:10.620
We weren't just screaming
into the void.

1:31:10.655 --> 1:31:12.551
People were listening.
It was actually

1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:16.724
creating change, um,
and some positive outcomes,

1:31:16.758 --> 1:31:18.379
and we really hope
that it'll continue

1:31:18.413 --> 1:31:19.379
through the rest
of the states.

1:31:52.137 --> 1:31:54.241
The FTC needs to strengthen
its regulations

1:31:54.275 --> 1:31:56.517
against, uh, multi-level
marketing companies.

1:31:56.551 --> 1:31:58.241
Pyramid schemes
are already illegal,

1:31:58.275 --> 1:32:03.413
um, the FTC, um, website
has all that information.

1:32:03.448 --> 1:32:05.517
Uh, I think the FTC
really needs to step up

1:32:05.551 --> 1:32:07.965
and expand that to all MLMs.

1:32:10.379 --> 1:32:14.172
<i>In the beginning
of doing a research
around MLMs,</i>

1:32:14.206 --> 1:32:16.931
I didn't understand
that 99% of people

1:32:16.965 --> 1:32:19.000
made nothing or lost money.

1:32:19.034 --> 1:32:21.344
And that's a lot, that's like
kind of a low figure.

1:32:21.379 --> 1:32:23.827
They think maybe it's 99.9.

1:32:23.862 --> 1:32:26.482
One, two, three.
Whoo!

1:32:27.896 --> 1:32:31.172
<i>In a successful
multi-level marketing scheme,</i>

1:32:31.206 --> 1:32:36.413
you need a lot of failure
because you're making money
off of the recruits

1:32:36.448 --> 1:32:41.344
and you're making money
off of their, um, desperation,

1:32:41.379 --> 1:32:46.862
which often manifests
as more investment
in the company.

1:32:46.896 --> 1:32:51.896
<i>LuLaRoe isn't
built for you to have
your own freedom</i>

1:32:51.931 --> 1:32:53.448
<i>and to have
your own empowerment.</i>

1:32:53.482 --> 1:32:56.931
It is meant to build
the people at the top.

1:32:56.965 --> 1:32:59.655
It's meant to make the people
at the top richer.

1:32:59.689 --> 1:33:01.689
Capitalism is the root
of all evil.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:10.172
<i>It does surprise me</i>

1:33:10.206 --> 1:33:12.068
<i>that LuLaRoe is still
in existence</i>

1:33:12.103 --> 1:33:16.310
because I didn't really think

1:33:16.344 --> 1:33:18.137
that they would be able
to fight off

1:33:18.172 --> 1:33:19.724
all of the litigation
against them

1:33:19.758 --> 1:33:21.862
without having to file
for bankruptcy.

1:33:21.896 --> 1:33:24.068
I think
that LuLaRoe still exists

1:33:24.103 --> 1:33:26.241
because Mark
and DeAnne Stidham

1:33:26.275 --> 1:33:29.931
want to continue making money
from this business,

1:33:29.965 --> 1:33:34.068
and what their business
is all about is selling dreams

1:33:34.862 --> 1:33:37.655
as opposed
to selling a product.

1:33:37.689 --> 1:33:41.172
And... and there are people
that still want to believe

1:33:41.206 --> 1:33:45.655
in the American dream
and the dream of LuLaRoe.

1:33:54.793 --> 1:33:56.344
<i>We just got here
to Cancun.</i>

1:33:57.448 --> 1:34:00.965
<i>This is so worth
the hard work.</i>

1:34:02.793 --> 1:34:05.275
I can't wait to get together
with you

1:34:05.310 --> 1:34:07.655
when you get here to Cancun.

1:34:07.689 --> 1:34:10.620
And those of you
that are not here, get busy,

1:34:10.655 --> 1:34:12.620
and know that we love giving.

1:34:15.931 --> 1:34:17.586
<i>I can't
believe it, I can't believe</i>

1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:19.827
<i>like this is still going on.</i>

1:34:19.862 --> 1:34:21.862
It's like none of this
had ever happened,

1:34:21.896 --> 1:34:23.620
and the cognitive
dissonance there

1:34:23.655 --> 1:34:26.551
is just like, it's crazy.

1:34:26.586 --> 1:34:28.965
<i>This is the one
where I had my son with me.</i>

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.241
It's like... I took Brooks.
it was so awesome.

1:34:31.275 --> 1:34:33.793
- What, he's like a baby?
- Yeah, I was nursing.

1:34:33.827 --> 1:34:35.482
And I was able to bring him.

1:34:35.517 --> 1:34:38.103
- Yeah.
- Do you know what I wonder?
I would love to know,

1:34:38.137 --> 1:34:39.655
and there's no way
to actually prove this,

1:34:39.689 --> 1:34:41.965
but I would love to know,
like how many babies were born

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.241
- because of LuLaRoe.
- How many times have you seen

1:34:44.275 --> 1:34:46.448
fund-raisers for like
IVF treatments?

1:34:46.482 --> 1:34:48.896
And all of us
are like, oh...

1:34:51.344 --> 1:34:54.034
<i>I ended up
in Cancun this weekend</i>

1:34:54.068 --> 1:34:57.241
because LuLaRoe
is doing a incentive trip,

1:34:57.275 --> 1:34:59.034
is what we call it
a Dream Trip

1:34:59.068 --> 1:35:02.034
and, um, leaders, high sellers
are here,

1:35:02.068 --> 1:35:03.448
<i>they would come together
once a year,</i>

1:35:03.482 --> 1:35:05.724
just coming together
to be with my people.

1:35:05.758 --> 1:35:08.655
But Brianna, you started
six years ago.

1:35:08.689 --> 1:35:09.931
- Yeah, almost.
- Yeah.

1:35:09.965 --> 1:35:11.482
So, I worked full-time
at the hospital.

1:35:11.517 --> 1:35:14.862
I was in nursing school,
and I was doing LuLaRoe,
like all at once.

1:35:14.896 --> 1:35:17.482
And so online just
worked really well for me.

1:35:17.517 --> 1:35:19.137
And then when I graduated
nursing school,

1:35:19.172 --> 1:35:21.931
I was like full-time LuLaRoe,
full-time at the hospital.

1:35:21.965 --> 1:35:24.724
And then eventually
LuLaRoe took over

1:35:24.758 --> 1:35:27.448
and I quit at the hospital
and haven't looked back.

1:35:27.482 --> 1:35:28.896
Did you buy
before you sold?

1:35:28.931 --> 1:35:32.275
I did. I bought,
I bought a lot before I sold.

1:35:32.310 --> 1:35:35.034
Like a lot, a lot, a lot.
I loved it.

1:35:35.068 --> 1:35:36.206
I mean, it was just...

1:35:37.482 --> 1:35:39.137
It made me feel good,

1:35:39.172 --> 1:35:40.758
and then the community
that I've built

1:35:40.793 --> 1:35:44.103
since then has been amazing.

1:35:45.172 --> 1:35:48.103
Everybody's looking
for this bad story,

1:35:48.137 --> 1:35:50.620
but it's not the bad story
that's really there.

1:35:50.655 --> 1:35:53.344
It's the empowerment
that we are bringing.

1:35:53.379 --> 1:35:56.310
It's the joy
that we're creating
in people's lives

1:35:56.344 --> 1:35:59.965
and this opportunity
that people have had to grow.

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.206
<i>And the people that are here</i>

1:36:02.241 --> 1:36:04.275
<i>are because of choices
that they've made
in their business.</i>

1:36:04.310 --> 1:36:05.931
And some people have left.

1:36:05.965 --> 1:36:08.758
And they can find reasons
as to why.

1:36:08.793 --> 1:36:11.000
And there could be reasons
that they want to use

1:36:11.034 --> 1:36:12.517
that maybe are
against LuLaRoe.

1:36:12.551 --> 1:36:15.862
It could be reasons on media
and things that they followed.

1:36:15.896 --> 1:36:19.758
But no matter what,
it all boils down
to a personal choice

1:36:19.793 --> 1:36:21.517
and how you choose
to run your business.

1:36:21.551 --> 1:36:23.931
I am here because
of the choices that I've made.

1:36:23.965 --> 1:36:26.793
Your... your customers
become your friends,
like it's not just...

1:36:26.827 --> 1:36:28.827
- Oh, she's like my bestie now,
it's wild.
- It's not,

1:36:28.862 --> 1:36:30.206
it's not like going
into Target.

1:36:30.241 --> 1:36:32.379
Like, my customers would be
like, "Hey, will this fit me?"

1:36:32.413 --> 1:36:33.586
Because I know their size.

1:36:33.620 --> 1:36:35.620
- She really does.
- You build that friendship.

1:36:35.655 --> 1:36:37.551
People would come up,
"Is that LuLa?"

1:36:37.586 --> 1:36:39.034
And I'm like, "Yeah, it is."

1:36:39.068 --> 1:36:40.689
- Well, and then you bond
with that person.
- Yeah.

1:36:40.724 --> 1:36:42.241
'Cause they know what LuLa is,

1:36:42.275 --> 1:36:44.206
- it's like this amazing bond.
- Absolutely.

1:36:44.241 --> 1:36:46.275
It gave me the confidence
and then I started getting

1:36:46.310 --> 1:36:48.241
into working out
and then I started...

1:36:48.275 --> 1:36:50.862
I actually managed to lose
like 60 pounds

1:36:50.896 --> 1:36:52.862
That's awesome.

1:36:52.896 --> 1:36:54.551
We are around and thriving.

1:36:54.586 --> 1:36:57.034
And it's... again it's
a people's perception
and choice.

1:36:57.068 --> 1:36:59.620
If they chose
to stop following LuLaRoe,

1:36:59.655 --> 1:37:02.896
then in their life,
we don't exist anymore,

1:37:02.931 --> 1:37:03.965
but we are still here.

1:37:09.172 --> 1:37:14.689
I really, really hate
when MLM participants
are portrayed as suckers.

1:37:14.724 --> 1:37:16.620
<i>There's nothing unusual
about someone</i>

1:37:16.655 --> 1:37:19.517
<i>who would like
to run their own business</i>

1:37:19.551 --> 1:37:22.310
<i>and have more time
with their families.</i>

1:37:22.344 --> 1:37:25.620
<i>That is what the
American dream is,</i>

1:37:25.655 --> 1:37:28.413
<i>and we've all been
pitched that since birth.</i>

1:37:28.448 --> 1:37:31.413
People tend to think
that folks wind up in groups

1:37:31.448 --> 1:37:34.448
like LuLaRoe
because of "brainwashing."

1:37:34.482 --> 1:37:37.068
They were brainwashed.
They were mind-controlled.

1:37:37.103 --> 1:37:38.586
That would never happen to me.

1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:41.793
We all are susceptible
to these methods
of manipulation.

1:37:41.827 --> 1:37:45.448
LuLaRoe used the tools
of psychological

1:37:45.482 --> 1:37:48.862
and emotional manipulation
to make money.

1:37:48.896 --> 1:37:50.931
As long as there are people
in this country

1:37:50.965 --> 1:37:53.482
who are locked out
of the dignified labor market

1:37:53.517 --> 1:37:57.517
and made a promise
that the American dream
is still available to them,

1:37:57.551 --> 1:37:59.413
the MLM industry will thrive.

1:37:59.448 --> 1:38:03.862
I did join a couple
of other MLMs
after leaving LuLaRoe

1:38:03.896 --> 1:38:05.310
just because I was
still trying to bring

1:38:05.344 --> 1:38:07.482
a little bit of income
into my family life,

1:38:08.344 --> 1:38:10.896
and none of those
panned out either.

1:38:10.931 --> 1:38:15.310
After LuLaRoe,
I really finally got the idea

1:38:15.344 --> 1:38:19.724
that this was not in any way
going to help me,

1:38:19.758 --> 1:38:21.517
and that these types
of companies

1:38:21.551 --> 1:38:23.310
were just predatory.

1:38:27.344 --> 1:38:29.379
<i>Yeah, that's starting
to look like a good...</i>

1:38:29.413 --> 1:38:30.689
It's ready to go,
cookie dough.

1:38:31.206 --> 1:38:33.241
- See.
- Ooh.

1:38:33.275 --> 1:38:35.793
You are my mother.
You hear the rhyme
you just did.

1:38:35.827 --> 1:38:37.965
It's ready to go,
cookie dough.

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.310
- Aw!
- Mmm-hmm.

1:38:39.344 --> 1:38:40.793
We could start us a jingle.

1:38:40.827 --> 1:38:43.896
Well, the American dream
is for me

1:38:43.931 --> 1:38:48.862
was, I promise you, just
to be financially stable

1:38:48.896 --> 1:38:50.551
and own my own business.

1:38:50.586 --> 1:38:52.586
<i>And LuLaRoe could have worked,</i>

1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:54.241
<i>could have been that for me.</i>

1:38:54.275 --> 1:38:57.482
However, I... maybe I'll...
I'll take all blame, though.

1:38:57.517 --> 1:39:00.931
I just didn't have
that fight to... to, um...

1:39:03.793 --> 1:39:04.862
to make it happen.

1:39:04.896 --> 1:39:06.827
<i>There you go. Voila!</i>

1:39:06.862 --> 1:39:09.206
<i>But I... I would like
to give it one more shot,</i>

1:39:09.241 --> 1:39:11.551
and it can be lucrative.

1:39:11.586 --> 1:39:15.551
If LuLaRoe came to me tomorrow
and asked me,

1:39:15.586 --> 1:39:19.655
"Hey, you wanna perform
on a cruise like you did?"

1:39:19.689 --> 1:39:24.689
Heck yes, please.
Like, let's go, win.

1:39:24.724 --> 1:39:26.482
Like, yeah, no, I...

1:39:27.758 --> 1:39:29.310
in a heartbeat.

1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:32.724
- You never stop.
- No.

1:39:32.758 --> 1:39:34.448
- Never stops, never.
- I can't.

1:39:34.482 --> 1:39:36.241
Never, never stops. It's okay.

1:39:36.275 --> 1:39:37.310
- I can't.

1:39:37.344 --> 1:39:39.241
- Oh.
- Check who that is.

1:39:39.275 --> 1:39:41.586
That is just in time.

1:39:41.620 --> 1:39:44.551
I get asked all the time,
after my experience
with LuLaRoe,

1:39:44.586 --> 1:39:47.586
"Why in the world
would you do another
direct sales company?"

1:39:48.448 --> 1:39:50.241
And the answer is,

1:39:50.275 --> 1:39:52.586
I honestly feel
it's apples and oranges.

1:39:53.344 --> 1:39:54.793
Here's my nail collection.

1:39:56.689 --> 1:39:58.586
I have like the
entire collection almost.

1:39:58.620 --> 1:40:00.068
I'm missing two.

1:40:00.103 --> 1:40:04.413
<i>If you look
at the Better Bureau Business,
the BBB rating,</i>

1:40:04.448 --> 1:40:06.896
I think LuLaRoe had an F.

1:40:06.931 --> 1:40:10.034
And my new companies
Plunder, Red Aspen,
they have an A.

1:40:10.068 --> 1:40:11.931
I think that says something.

1:40:11.965 --> 1:40:14.724
So this is my
old LuLaRoe group.

1:40:14.758 --> 1:40:16.241
<i>I struggle
with this MLM</i>

1:40:16.275 --> 1:40:18.655
<i>because I do like MLMs.</i>

1:40:18.689 --> 1:40:20.862
<i>I love a lot
of different MLMs,</i>

1:40:20.896 --> 1:40:23.137
<i>and I like to support
other women</i>

1:40:23.172 --> 1:40:24.965
<i>and their businesses,
of course.</i>

1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.137
So, I would like to say
that I'm not for them,

1:40:28.172 --> 1:40:30.310
but my nails come from them.

1:40:30.344 --> 1:40:31.896
My candles come from them.

1:40:31.931 --> 1:40:34.275
You know what I mean?
Like, I feel like
there's a purpose for it.

1:40:34.793 --> 1:40:35.896
Um...

1:40:38.310 --> 1:40:41.620
And I feel like
they've been around
for decades and decades.

1:40:43.275 --> 1:40:45.448
<i>My advice
to anybody going</i>

1:40:45.482 --> 1:40:48.655
<i>into an MLM
or even considering it.</i>

1:40:48.689 --> 1:40:50.413
I don't care
if it's nail strips,

1:40:50.448 --> 1:40:53.896
protein shakes, vitamins,
what else is out there,

1:40:53.931 --> 1:40:57.206
make-up, um, hair products.

1:40:57.793 --> 1:41:00.137
I don't care what it is.

1:41:00.172 --> 1:41:04.310
Say no. Run as far as you can,
as fast as you can.

1:41:06.965 --> 1:41:08.620
<i>I don't think
the takeaway</i>

1:41:08.655 --> 1:41:11.034
<i>from the LulaRoe's story is
that it's wrong to have hope.</i>

1:41:11.827 --> 1:41:13.827
<i>It's good to have hope.</i>

1:41:13.862 --> 1:41:17.551
<i>The American dream
preys on hope.</i>

1:41:17.586 --> 1:41:21.000
<i>And so until we make
the American dream</i>

1:41:21.655 --> 1:41:23.620
<i>less all-consuming,</i>

1:41:23.655 --> 1:41:27.206
<i>that hope will lead people
to harm.</i>

1:41:27.241 --> 1:41:29.827
So, it's the American dream
that has to change,

1:41:29.862 --> 1:41:32.482
not our capacity to hope
that has to change.

1:41:35.310 --> 1:41:36.379
<i>I'm not surprised
at all</i>

1:41:36.413 --> 1:41:38.448
<i>that LuLaRoe still exists.</i>

1:41:38.482 --> 1:41:41.620
<i>This is just what the people
who start MLMs do.</i>

1:41:41.655 --> 1:41:44.689
<i>And if it wasn't LuLaRoe
that was sticking around,</i>

1:41:44.724 --> 1:41:47.241
Mark and DeAnne
would go start another MLM.

1:41:47.275 --> 1:41:49.724
<i>We're aware
of the negativity,
but guess what?</i>

1:41:49.758 --> 1:41:53.655
<i>It is a minute amount
compared to all</i>

1:41:53.689 --> 1:41:56.482
<i>of the amazing positive things
that are happening.</i>

1:41:56.517 --> 1:41:58.931
<i>Forget about using
the truth as your defense.</i>

1:41:58.965 --> 1:42:01.034
<i>Use kindness as your defense.</i>

1:42:01.068 --> 1:42:02.931
<i>That is the culture
of LuLaRoe.</i>

1:42:02.965 --> 1:42:05.000
This is just the way
we do business here

1:42:05.551 --> 1:42:08.206
to make people think

1:42:08.241 --> 1:42:11.068
that they're pursuing
their own success

1:42:11.103 --> 1:42:14.758
while they're actually
making someone else rich.

1:42:17.068 --> 1:42:20.586
<i>It's just greed,
pure American greed.</i>

1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:23.206
<i>Each and every
one of you are a part
of the American dream</i>

1:42:23.241 --> 1:42:26.931
<i>because you are entrepreneurs
and you own your own business,</i>

1:42:26.965 --> 1:42:30.034
<i>and I will tell you,
some days are not so good.</i>

1:42:30.068 --> 1:42:31.620
<i>Guess what?</i>

1:42:31.655 --> 1:42:34.862
<i>So many days are so amazing.</i>

1:42:38.413 --> 1:42:39.724
LuLaRoe.
