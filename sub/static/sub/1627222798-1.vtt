WEBVTT

03:09.080 --> 03:10.240
Good afternoon, crew.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.920
I trust that you're
enjoying a pleasant flight

03:11.920 --> 03:14.360
to our destination
Jovian moon Callisto,

03:14.360 --> 03:16.240
Princess of Arcadia.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.400
As we peer off starboard,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.440
we are rewarded with an
impressive view of Themisto,

03:20.440 --> 03:23.920
daughter of the river god
Inachus and lover of Zeus.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.800
Zeus has no time for his
lover right now, Hetfield.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.960
I am busy building
Mount Olympus.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.480
But the view
really is worth it.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.600
Uh-huh.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.640
Possession!

03:53.600 --> 03:54.480
You lose everything

03:54.480 --> 03:57.160
because you don't see
yourself as a winner.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.080
Here we go.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.600
Yes, Sebastian.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:02.400 --> 04:04.400
I'm not finished winning
my possessions back.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.440
Yes... here we go.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.040
You especially, could benefit

04:09.040 --> 04:11.400
from this motivational tool work.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.560
And that begins with a team
building exercise, everyone.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.399
Come on. Up.
Gather 'round.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.640
Come on, come on, come on.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.320
Gather 'round. Up.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.000
So, it's pretty
straightforward you see.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.680
I close my eyes, and you
catch me when I fall.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.160
Are you ordering
us to catch you?

04:29.160 --> 04:32.400
No Dasha, I trust
that you will catch me.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.880
So it's not an order then?

04:34.720 --> 04:38.240
No. It's a trust exercise.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.159
And you Sebastian,
you'll be next.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.720
Okay then.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.600
I must advise

04:43.600 --> 04:45.520
against this course
of action, Odd.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.800
Brilliant. Brilliant.

04:57.159 --> 04:58.680
What the shit, guys?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.680
I think I'll skip my turn.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.280
Very funny.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.120
And what about me?

05:05.120 --> 05:08.200
Should I have some sort
of trust issues now? Hmm?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.400
Yeah, okay.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.200
No, Dasha.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.680
It's not okay.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.800
My successful astronaut career

05:15.800 --> 05:17.000
could come to an
end just like that

05:17.000 --> 05:20.440
because you guys find it amusing
to watch me break my back.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.160
Maybe it is already over,
because I now have developed

05:23.160 --> 05:25.720
some sort of irrational
fear of gravity.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.240
Barophobia.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.280
What?

05:28.280 --> 05:30.880
It's the fear of gravity.
Barophobia.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.720
Bullshit!

05:31.720 --> 05:33.680
Not bullshit. Barophobia!

05:33.680 --> 05:35.159
I smell bullshit, Lucien.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.880
Barophobia is the
correct word, Odd.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.640
Oh, please. What's so funny?

05:47.640 --> 05:51.640
No, it just getting
very emotional, Odd.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.560
Well, forgive me for showing

05:53.560 --> 05:56.880
that I'm a real
guy with feelings.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.800
Unfortunately, we can't be
all cold superficial bitches

06:00.800 --> 06:03.080
that are here just because
of our great looks!

06:09.720 --> 06:11.200
What?

06:33.520 --> 06:34.760
I don't know if I'm cut out

06:34.760 --> 06:36.360
for this job anymore.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.240
Don't worry about it,
your nuts are too tight.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.320
But I burned breakfast
this morning.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.640
Ha! See, burning breakfast.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.960
You're less of a machine
than you thought you were.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.320
Wait, so you're telling me
I need to burn more meals?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.400
What do you see?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.800
Does this mean you
think I've gone mad?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.400
No, it's just an exercise.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.880
I've probably gone mad.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.480
What do you see?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.280
A Rorschach inkblot test.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.400
I see. Now give me
an intuitive answer.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.800
No, I understand
what you're asking

07:09.800 --> 07:12.400
but I'm just, I'm
not sure I can comply.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.840
Look at the pattern

07:13.840 --> 07:16.040
and compare it against
what data you can

07:16.040 --> 07:18.640
but don't analyze the process.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.840
I can try.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.600
That's the spirit!
What do you see?

07:44.440 --> 07:45.920
Well, come on!

07:48.240 --> 07:49.720
A cockroach.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.240
What do you see this time?

07:55.280 --> 07:56.760
It's a cockroach.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.760
Nurse, cancel my one o'clock.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.720
It's all the same thing.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.560
Is there a problem, Dasha?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.120
The food on this space craft

08:19.120 --> 08:21.320
nothing to do with real food.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.200
I'm a human being

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
and I prefer black caviar
and vodka instead.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.600
What the burning smell?

08:35.360 --> 08:37.240
Did I ruin them?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.400
No, no, quite the opposite.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.120
That's very clever, Hetfield,
and kind of charming.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.640
Magnitude of compensation
for total perturbation?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.360
2.1 meters per second.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.600
Axial component?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.600
1.8 meters per second.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.920
And the lateral component
is 0.3 meters per second.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.400
Correct.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.360
Hetfield, speaking
of perturbation,

09:10.400 --> 09:13.000
What did you think of
Odd's performance today?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.760
The incident taught me
that I need to evolve.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.720
Taught me that Odd is
turning into a dickhead.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.280
Bigger one than usual.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.680
TCM Two Bravo complete.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.120
Execution error?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.920
Less than 1%.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.760
Chick chick boom!

09:31.680 --> 09:32.520
If I'm to cope

09:32.520 --> 09:35.520
with the continuous shifting
social dynamics on board Araya,

09:35.520 --> 09:38.880
then I must improve my
human interaction skills.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.560
Don't give yourself
a hard time, Hetfield.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.200
You're doing just fine.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.200
Case in point,

09:44.200 --> 09:46.680
a harmless lie to
make me feel better.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.240
Ouch! I was being sincere.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.520
Odd bothers me too, brother

09:51.520 --> 09:52.840
I mean, I don't know if I can handle

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
another four years under his command.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.680
Any reason in particular?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.960
He's become so, corporate,

10:01.960 --> 10:03.320
just like those
pencil-pushing goons

10:03.320 --> 10:05.480
in charge of this whole operation.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.160
Maintaining a chain
of command is paramount

10:08.160 --> 10:11.960
to the success of the
Callisto mining project, Rex.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.800
Don't worry your sweet
little circuits, Hetfield,

10:13.800 --> 10:15.760
I'm not planning a
mutiny or anything.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.640
We have a lot in common, Rex.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.160
You're a machine at
times. No offense.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.120
None taken, brother.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.520
I mean, I worked hard to
become a machine I am today.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.200
How do you balance
precision and discipline

10:29.200 --> 10:30.920
with a sense of humanity?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.120
Sharp instincts.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.560
Explain?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.840
Take these trajectory
correction maneuvers

10:38.840 --> 10:40.080
we just performed, right.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.600
Why do you even need me here?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.680
I mean, you have complete
control over the thrusters

10:46.680 --> 10:48.120
and the rockets, right?

10:48.120 --> 10:50.400
Fully automated decision
support systems

10:50.400 --> 10:52.520
are proven to be flawed.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.080
Correct.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.160
Because computers don't
have that human touch

10:56.160 --> 10:59.760
That... animal instinct,
gut feel, je ne sais quoi.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.120
I mean, you ever get a
hunch about anything?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.480
So I'd be more effective

11:04.480 --> 11:07.600
if I developed
instincts and hunches?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.720
Okay, Hetfield.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.800
Close your eyes.

11:12.320 --> 11:17.400
How far from Callisto do you
feel, do you sense that we are?

11:18.320 --> 11:20.200
5 million, 624 thousand,

11:20.200 --> 11:22.160
277 kilometers.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.720
Approximately.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.040
That's close enough.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.760
I look forward to meeting
that base camp crew

11:27.760 --> 11:28.760
when we get there.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.480
Wouldn't it be
great if they built

11:30.480 --> 11:32.040
like, a dance hall
or something?

11:33.120 --> 11:34.880
Are we finished here, Rex?

11:34.880 --> 11:35.920
Why, am I boring you?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.080
On the contrary, it's just that

11:37.080 --> 11:39.960
I have an appointment that
requires all my attention.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.400
Sebastian, I must remind you

12:02.400 --> 12:05.040
that I am spending valuable
time on this exercise

12:05.040 --> 12:07.280
and that I have
deactivated multitasking

12:07.280 --> 12:09.360
with all other crew members.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.640
Please proceed with
the meditation lesson.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.160
All right, so just...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.800
so just take a deep breath.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.040
I cannot breathe,
I'm a computer.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.320
Man, do you have
to be so literal?

12:21.320 --> 12:24.160
Jesus, what are you
German or something?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.960
My complex humor array

12:25.960 --> 12:27.760
was manufactured in Dusseldorf,

12:27.760 --> 12:30.000
but my many other components
originated from all over-

12:30.000 --> 12:31.760
Do you have a breathing
equivalent or something?

12:31.760 --> 12:34.000
My cooling systems are
active at all times

12:34.000 --> 12:35.920
but I do not respire.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.240
Can you just make a breathing
noise or something?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.120
Yeah, make it louder.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.160
Can you put some reverb on that?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.520
Whoa!

13:00.520 --> 13:02.160
Oh.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.400
Okay, okay, that's too much.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.440
It's starting to trip me out a bit

13:04.440 --> 13:05.760
Can you just chill
out a little bit now?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.560
My internal cooling system keeps

13:07.560 --> 13:10.600
my central core at the optimum
stable operating temperature

13:10.600 --> 13:12.680
of 395 degrees Kelvin.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.040
You ever notice how when you
ask someone to chill out

13:14.040 --> 13:15.080
they don't chill out?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.120
396 Kelvin.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.680
Like, you're just gonna
ask someone to chill out

13:18.680 --> 13:20.800
and they automatically lower
their core temperature?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.000
You know. What is
the deal with that?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.360
397 Kelvin.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.920
All right, the counting's
freaking me out, all right.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.680
Can we just...

13:26.680 --> 13:28.360
We'll add a mantra, that
might help things, all right.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.080
So just...

13:30.080 --> 13:32.240
Om...

13:39.360 --> 13:40.600
400 degrees Kelvin!

13:40.600 --> 13:41.320
All right, okay, okay.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.560
We'll join in together, all right?

13:43.560 --> 13:45.160
We'll do it together.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.240
Om...

13:48.240 --> 13:50.240
Come on, Hetfield.
Gotta join in, man.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.200
- Om...
- Om...

14:00.320 --> 14:02.240
- Om...
- Ah ya...

14:02.240 --> 14:04.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what happened there?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.280
Are you enlightened now?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.520
That was an external disturbance

14:08.520 --> 14:10.640
I have not ascended,
I can assure you.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.760
It was something
external to the ship.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.520
I gotta terminate this session
and notify the commander.

14:17.640 --> 14:22.440
Odd, please don't stay out
there longer than you need to.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.280
We have no idea why it blew up.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.160
And without a working
isoflux antenna,

14:27.160 --> 14:28.560
we won't ever know, will we?

14:29.440 --> 14:33.880
Because nobody else here
is a competent engineer.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.280
It's all up to me, as usual.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.840
This might do wonders for my
acute baraphobia, mind you.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.160
And when I'm done, then,

14:43.160 --> 14:46.680
for this crew's amusement,
maybe I should just float away.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.080
You know what, just
be very careful.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.480
Do you see anything
out of the ordinary?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.840
Just a spectacular
view of Themisto.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.600
It almost appears to be glowing.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.920
I'll take your word for it, Odd.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.600
Until I regain X-band telemetry,
I'm partially blind.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.760
We'll have you back to
normal in just a tick.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.720
Unmounting isoflux antenna.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.520
Isoflux antenna is online!

15:59.400 --> 16:01.640
Initiating calibration sequence.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.760
We should have eyes in
approximately two minutes.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.200
I'm detecting an
increased heart rate.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.600
Please respond.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.080
So beautiful.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.080
What's out there, Odd?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.280
Commander Odd, please respond!

16:34.360 --> 16:35.880
I must enter.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.960
Odd? Odd!

16:48.560 --> 16:50.040
What a rush!

16:50.600 --> 16:52.560
Oh, I feel good.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.800
- Odd, you really scared me.
- Totally rad!

16:55.560 --> 16:57.440
What happened out of there?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.960
Hetfield?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.680
How's the new isoflux
antenna functioning?

17:00.680 --> 17:01.800
It's functioning perfectly.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.720
What happened out there, Odd?

17:03.720 --> 17:06.720
Oh! It was good to get
out and about, you know?

17:06.720 --> 17:07.960
I feel good.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.240
What did you seen out of there?

17:09.240 --> 17:12.240
Jupiter! And lots of stars.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.960
Yeah, I feel fantastic!

17:14.960 --> 17:17.200
What did you see
that was beautiful?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.680
Life!

17:19.359 --> 17:21.000
Life's good, man.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.400
Dasha.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.720
What?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.079
I'm sorry I said that you were here

17:27.079 --> 17:28.920
just because of your great looks.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.800
I was insensitive,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.040
and I was wrong.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.600
Okay...

17:34.600 --> 17:38.040
Well, appreciate
that you saying that.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.640
And I appreciate you.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.840
I appreciate all of you.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.480
I don't tell you often enough.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.680
You never tell us at all.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.360
Things will change.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.880
You're smart,

17:48.600 --> 17:50.080
and sexy.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.680
You guys are great.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.600
I just want to say that.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.080
Ah, piss off.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.240
Two years. Two years
I've been up here

18:14.240 --> 18:17.080
and I'm still a perfect
Homo Sapiens specimen.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.760
Go on, punch me in the stomach.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.320
For your own good.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.320
See what it's like to be a man.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.680
You gonna finish that?

18:29.680 --> 18:31.680
Please Rex, be my guest.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.880
I must advise against
cross contamination, Rex.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.160
We inhabit a closed system.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.840
Cross contamination
of what, exactly?

18:44.960 --> 18:46.680
Is someone sick or something?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.240
Microorganisms can be transmitted

18:50.240 --> 18:52.440
through the sharing of
food and beverages.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.240
Do not let your fears
choose your destiny.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.880
Amen to that, brother.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.800
Since when were you afraid of

19:09.800 --> 19:12.520
space cooties phobia
or something?

19:12.520 --> 19:14.520
That's mysophobia.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.320
Mysophobia.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.600
Wouldn't that be like a
fear of mice or something?

19:21.600 --> 19:24.840
There are no mice
on board Araya.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.040
Then what?
What on board?

19:28.440 --> 19:29.800
Okay, you got me.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.960
I have not been entirely
truthful with you.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.520
Yeah? Do tell.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.560
There are mice in the pirozhki.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.200
Was that a joke?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.240
'Cause it sounded like a joke
but it wasn't funny. I mean-

19:49.240 --> 19:51.000
While I'm not capable of truly

19:51.000 --> 19:53.240
appreciating humor in the
same way humans can

19:53.240 --> 19:55.600
I am familiar with
linguistic structures

19:55.600 --> 19:57.320
commonly found in jokes.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.920
My attempt at comedy
was to lighten the mood,

20:01.920 --> 20:03.720
certainly not to
ruin your appetite.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.400
Axial component?

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
0.9 meters per second.

20:22.800 --> 20:27.200
Making the lateral component
0.7 meters per second.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.920
Correct. TCM Two
Charlie complete.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.520
What was that?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.800
It's possible that
a negligible amount

20:36.800 --> 20:38.960
of unignited propellant
from the short burn

20:38.960 --> 20:40.400
at our current periapsis

20:40.400 --> 20:43.360
registered an escape
velocity calculation error.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.400
No no, that sounded like
a distress beacon alert.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.560
Strange. I'm not
receiving anything.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.720
It's possible that the
new isoflux antenna

20:50.720 --> 20:53.600
requires a minor recalibration
now that it's run in.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.880
Plausible. I guess.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.560
Initiate isoflux
antenna recalibration.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.960
Recalibrating now.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.760
Affirmative! I'm confirming
a false positive.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.000
Execution error for TCM
Two Charlie is less than 1%.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.160
Sweet!

21:12.160 --> 21:13.440
And that's the last of the TCMs

21:13.440 --> 21:15.040
before we arrive at Callisto.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.480
Then we're done here, Rex.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.360
I do believe there's
a game of Possession

21:18.360 --> 21:20.480
about to commence
on the mess deck

21:20.480 --> 21:22.320
if you feel like joining in?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.680
Is a pig's ass pork?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.880
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.600
This is Petrozza, this is
Petrozza, this is Petrozza.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.640
Mayday. Petrozza.

21:33.640 --> 21:38.240
Mean Jovian orbit radius
5-8-2-3-0-4-7 kilometers

21:38.240 --> 21:41.120
Eccentricity 0.2006

21:41.120 --> 21:45.000
Inclination 47.48 degrees.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.680
Unidentified malfunction.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.080
Unknown number of
persons on board.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.440
Immediate assistance
required. Over.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.000
Petrozza, this is Araya.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.480
Respond. Over.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.880
This is Petrozza,
receiving you. Over.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.400
And what is the nature
of the emergency? Over.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.200
Unidentified malfunction. Over.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.760
Hold your position,
I have a hunch.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.160
Yes. A hunch!

22:09.160 --> 22:10.360
Yes, I have a hunch

22:10.360 --> 22:13.640
that you may be able to
provide vital intelligence.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.000
Adjusting course for
intercept. Over.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.600
Affirmative, Araya.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.640
Maintaining mean
Jovian orbit radius

22:19.640 --> 22:23.480
5-8-2-3-0-4-7 kilometers

22:23.480 --> 22:27.360
Eccentricity 0.2006

22:27.360 --> 22:30.720
Inclination 47.48 degrees.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.640
Over.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.440
Ah, just give me a moment.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.960
Almost...

22:36.800 --> 22:38.920
Hello. Dudbrook reporting here.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.360
Why he's always saying that?

22:41.280 --> 22:43.280
I hope you're all
enjoying your flight.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.880
Shh!

22:44.880 --> 22:46.200
Here in England it's a ripe old

22:46.200 --> 22:47.480
- 46 degrees Celsius.
- Don't shush me.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.360
Shh!

22:48.360 --> 22:50.600
Barry Hunt won the
Davis McCup last week.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.520
Go Barry!

22:51.520 --> 22:54.280
Princess Rhiannon finally
gave birth and it's a boy!

22:54.280 --> 22:55.280
They're naming him Marmaduke

22:55.280 --> 22:57.480
and he's a healthy 2.9 kilograms.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.040
Why we need to listen
about royal family

23:00.040 --> 23:00.880
if we are here?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.760
Do you want me to pause
the video or what?

23:02.760 --> 23:05.680
- No, no, keep going. No, no.
- Oh, no. No, no, go on.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.960
All's well here at HQ,

23:06.960 --> 23:09.840
however, there is some concern
over the falling stock price

23:09.840 --> 23:11.400
due to the fuel shortage.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.640
You fellows will have
to stop drinking it.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.720
Is he funny?

23:16.040 --> 23:17.880
He thinks he's funny, doesn't he.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.560
If stock prices don't
recover shortly

23:19.560 --> 23:20.920
It could result in changes

23:20.920 --> 23:23.320
to the Callisto mission framework.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.840
That's bogus!

23:24.840 --> 23:27.920
Anyhoo, I'll keep you all
updated as I learn more.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.240
Good luck.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.840
Well, I assume that no one
wants to watch that crap again?

23:36.400 --> 23:38.920
They're going to
maroon us out here.

23:38.920 --> 23:39.840
I can feel it.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.240
An unlikely scenario.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.640
The Callisto mining colony is
the company's top priority.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.960
What's the matter, y'all?

23:46.960 --> 23:48.440
Getting soft?

23:49.280 --> 23:51.600
Well, would you like to
record a reply message?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, do I ever.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.680
Set it up and let her roll.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.880
Just give me one moment here.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.000
No, no, take your time.
I gotta...

24:01.000 --> 24:02.280
I gotta think about
what to say.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.040
Please Odd, calm down
and think things over.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.640
Dudbrook didn't stipulate any
adverse mission deviations.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.560
Yeah, well, so why'd
he say anything at all?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.040
He just wanna piss us off?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.920
He knows exactly what
he's doing, Rex.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.400
He's just maneuvering
us, like chess pieces.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.280
All right, we're ready in
five, four, three, two...

24:24.360 --> 24:25.840
Hello, Dudbrook.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.880
Commander Odd here,
of the Araya.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.400
The crew and I have had
the pleasure of viewing

24:30.400 --> 24:32.920
your latest video message

24:33.800 --> 24:36.520
and I must say we are
rather displeased.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.400
So I have this
message back to you.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.200
You're a total hestkuk!

24:51.000 --> 24:55.040
Well? Can I get some
support here? Rex?

24:57.240 --> 25:00.080
I just, follow orders, man.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.160
Come on then, Sebastian.
This is your chance.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.240
You don't have to do what
he says, Sebastian.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.520
I'm not afraid of these scumbags.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.720
Dudbrook, you're a hestkuk.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.200
Hestkuk!

25:18.440 --> 25:20.640
Well, I guess that
concludes our broadcast.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.600
Thank you for listening.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.520
And we'll see you again soon.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.280
Lucien?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.800
Yes, Dasha.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.680
Could you recite me some poetry?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.880
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.960
What? What wrong with that?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.040
Never mind.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.520
Look, really, it's
not my strong suit.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.280
We're consuming too much oxygen.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.960
God help us if some asshole
is not giving us enough air.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.200
I figure we're consuming
more than we should be

26:07.200 --> 26:09.760
by about 20%.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.920
Maybe your calculations
are wrong.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.880
Have you considered
that possibility?

26:13.880 --> 26:16.640
I've checked that
three times already.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.760
That's enough oxygen
for a whole new guy.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.160
Ooh.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.320
So, Sebastian, remind us
again how you got this job

26:27.320 --> 26:30.640
on the most advanced spacecraft
ever built by mankind.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.800
Well, I imagine it was a
very short list of applicants

26:34.800 --> 26:37.200
wanting a one-way
trip to frozen hell

26:37.200 --> 26:39.960
half a billion kilometers
from their home.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.360
For the record, Lucien

26:41.360 --> 26:44.520
the mission brief
specifies a return trip.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.200
You see? Nothing but negativity
floating around here.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.800
- Float, float, float.
- I dunno, man.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.760
Don't mean to criticize

26:51.760 --> 26:54.360
but you're sounding pretty
negative right now.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.160
Don't you get it?

26:56.160 --> 26:59.520
I'm trying to light a
fire in your bellies.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.080
Life is a precious gift
that just keeps on giving.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.560
And it's our responsibility
to give back.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.760
By being the best that we can be.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.920
You might not believe this

27:16.920 --> 27:20.200
but, I used to be
just like all of you.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.080
Maybe not so much like you.

27:25.080 --> 27:28.800
But like all of you,
I was a total failure at life.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.960
Whoa. Easy up, jackass.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.680
Until, I decided to be
the best that I can be.

27:36.680 --> 27:37.920
And with that commitment

27:37.920 --> 27:40.240
I exploded beyond what you think

27:40.240 --> 27:43.920
what I thought,
was humanly possible,

27:43.920 --> 27:47.800
By harnessing the power
of positive thinking

27:47.800 --> 27:49.080
within the human spirit.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.760
So what are you saying?

27:50.760 --> 27:55.440
That is, unlimited human
spirit power is consuming

27:55.440 --> 27:57.040
enough oxygen for two?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.320
I don't think he's getting
enough oxygen at all.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.680
Oh, you can laugh.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.640
But I'm feeling more
alive than ever before.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.680
I'm smarter, stronger...

28:11.680 --> 28:14.000
Bet I could still take
you in an arm wrestle.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.200
I see your bait
and I'm not biting.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.400
I have transcended the
impulses of the ego.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.920
I'm no longer driven by
the pleasure principle.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.640
Fascinating, you know.

28:31.640 --> 28:35.480
How many ancient cultures
from all over the Earth

28:35.480 --> 28:37.400
believed that by
consuming an animal

28:37.400 --> 28:39.160
or a human, or part thereof

28:40.200 --> 28:42.400
that they would absorb
its particular qualities

28:42.400 --> 28:43.840
and strengths.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.000
Why, you little hippy shit!

28:58.840 --> 29:00.320
Guys. Come on.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.000
Stop it.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
- You like that?
- All hands on neck.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.200
That is enough. Break it up!

29:12.960 --> 29:15.280
Sebastian, operations
deck, incoming message.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.280
Eat shit, you bag of shit.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.400
I'll have you
court-martialed for this!

29:29.600 --> 29:32.160
Hello. Dudbrook reporting here.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.560
Hello, Dudbrook reporting there.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.040
Unfortunately,
aspects surrounding

29:36.040 --> 29:38.560
the company's market
performance haven't improved.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.520
In fact, they're worse.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.480
- Uh-oh, here we are.
- We anticipate a recovery

29:43.480 --> 29:45.640
but this could take
longer than expected.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.200
Should this be the case,
the company will have no option

29:48.200 --> 29:50.800
but to hand down two
involuntary redundancy packages

29:50.800 --> 29:53.360
to the equivalent
of 13 weeks salary,

29:53.360 --> 29:55.800
plus pro rata long
service and benefits.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.400
Well, I'll be bumfuzzled.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.320
In accordance with
article 204, section 57

30:01.320 --> 30:03.400
of your terms of employment,

30:03.400 --> 30:06.320
selection criteria for
involuntary redundancy

30:06.320 --> 30:09.240
in this particular scenario
will be performance based.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.440
Good luck.

30:10.440 --> 30:14.360
Sebastian, you did send
that last message, yeah?

30:14.360 --> 30:16.720
The one where we called
Dudbrook a hestkuk.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.200
Of course I did.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.760
Oh crap, dude,
you don't think...

30:20.760 --> 30:24.120
Well, if it's performance-based,
that's you two...

30:24.120 --> 30:26.000
forget it.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.320
Odd, be careful, please.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.000
That data bank contains
precious archives.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.480
Well, Dudbrook didn't
seem pissed off though.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.240
That's because he
hasn't seen it yet.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.760
Our message takes about 40
minutes to get to Earth, right?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.920
And his reply will take
40 minutes to get back.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
Well, there goes my career!

30:42.920 --> 30:44.240
Great, you've just corrupted

30:44.240 --> 30:46.280
our archive of vintage dubstep.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.080
Oh man, I was just getting
into those golden oldies.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.600
Dubstep blows!

30:54.320 --> 30:56.280
You know, next time I see

30:56.280 --> 31:00.400
that pencil-neck shirt
stuffed desk jockey Dudbrook,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.280
I'm gonna eat his
friggin' face off!

31:05.880 --> 31:07.240
Just for the record,

31:07.240 --> 31:08.320
I didn't wanna say those things,

31:08.320 --> 31:10.640
he made me say them,
you all saw it.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.160
Made me feel dirty.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.400
- Lame.
- Mm.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.280
If two are getting fired

31:28.280 --> 31:31.680
then why didn't Dudbrook say
that they'd be on the flight

31:31.680 --> 31:33.640
back to Earth with the others?

31:36.480 --> 31:37.960
- Screw squash.
- Mm.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.920
Why didn't you recite
Dasha some poetry?

31:50.280 --> 31:51.240
Excuse me?

31:51.240 --> 31:53.360
I mean, I know you
know poetry, so...

31:53.360 --> 31:55.600
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- You know everything else.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.240
Well, it's just that there
was a lot of people around

32:01.240 --> 32:04.360
and it just didn't
seem appropriate.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.000
- Stage fright, huh?
- Ha!

32:06.760 --> 32:10.560
I laugh at death, I kill for a
kiss, and I laugh for a song!

32:13.920 --> 32:18.920
- Say, you wanna dance?
- Don't get me wrong.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.960
No, no. I mean I'm
not a dancing person.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.520
I'm not really good at it,
it's just... no.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.480
Sure you can dance,
I'll teach you.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.320
Oh, no, no, no.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.120
No. No!

32:31.120 --> 32:34.040
Hetfield, dial up a dance
hall and make it zero G.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.520
No!

32:37.120 --> 32:38.920
Slow, slow, Hetfield!

32:39.840 --> 32:41.320
What's the matter with you?

32:45.560 --> 32:48.440
Odd says I got no ambition, huh?

32:51.920 --> 32:55.720
- You? What?
- Always knew I'd make CO.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.480
Ooh.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.560
Ah sorry, I've just
got two left feet.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.760
Unfortunately, they're
from different species.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
You know what?

33:23.240 --> 33:25.880
I feel my Spidey senses tingling.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.120
When I get home in
four years' time,

34:13.120 --> 34:14.600
I'll probably make admiral.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.960
Thanks for the dance, old man!

34:18.960 --> 34:20.400
Charming.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.679
No, seems to be something else.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.400
Seems like we'll be spared
Dudbrook's bullshit for today.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.159
It's videos from home.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.719
Oh, of our families!

34:41.960 --> 34:43.639
Oh, it's Ma and Pa!

34:43.639 --> 34:45.120
Hi chickpea!

34:45.120 --> 34:47.120
Hi Momma's sweet pea.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.400
Hope you're having fun up there.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.639
We even done bought a telescope

34:51.639 --> 34:53.239
hopin' we could see ya up there.

34:53.239 --> 34:56.000
Yeah, but we can't see zip with it.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.760
Maybe just a lot of hard-earned
cash down the drain.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.560
But we'll keep trying
anyway, honey.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.160
Love you, pumpkin.

35:04.160 --> 35:07.680
Bye bye, Mama's sweet pecan pie.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.440
Okay, oh, okay, I see
what's going on here.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.160
Well played, Dudbrook!
Well played.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.600
Shh! My message is next.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.520
Dmitri!

36:02.640 --> 36:04.320
Shit, these are short!

36:05.360 --> 36:06.880
Yeah, and heavily edited too.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.880
Am I the only one that can
see what's going on here?

36:10.880 --> 36:12.560
This is such an obvious ploy.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.280
Shut up Odd, here's mine.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.760
Look, look, look, look, look!

36:15.760 --> 36:17.240
Hey mate.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.600
I still don't fully understand
why you're up there in space

36:20.600 --> 36:23.800
but, well, you were
always the bright one.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.440
Fluffy here's doing well.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.800
She caught a snake the other
day, but didn't get bit.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.680
And, oh, Barry Hunt
won the Davis McCup!

36:32.680 --> 36:34.160
What the hell?

36:35.320 --> 36:36.520
Who the hell are these people?

36:43.960 --> 36:45.160
That's really weird.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.880
I don't understand any of this.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.440
Yeah, these are definitely
not my parents.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.960
Chinese government's
in on this for sure.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.400
Ja! My wife, Therese.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.520
This must be my turn to
get all warm and fuzzy.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.840
What hestkuk puts artichoke
on pizza? Imbeciles!

37:42.840 --> 37:46.080
Your wife is very
sexy woman, Odd.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.960
Yeah, Odd.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.360
She is hotter than a
two-dollar pistol.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.920
Shitty artichoke.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.920
I'd eat your wife's
artichoke any day.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.840
It's the company.
It's in my file.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.800
They're the ones supplying
my pizzeria with artichokes.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.920
They want to destroy me.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.520
Zeus turned a young girl
named Cynara into an artichoke.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.400
Hetfield, am I right?

38:15.400 --> 38:17.040
That is correct.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.280
Huzzah!

38:19.960 --> 38:21.800
We've come full circle!

38:21.800 --> 38:24.320
Like Themisto, a moon in orbit.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.160
Themisto, lover of Zeus.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.240
Don't you get it?

38:29.240 --> 38:31.800
Zeus is spying on us.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.800
Yeah, he can see everything.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.080
With his big red eye.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.320
Zeus can see everything
with his big red eye!

38:48.480 --> 38:50.200
I like messages from home.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.480
I think they're sort of nice

38:51.480 --> 38:53.720
and we don't get enough of them.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.240
Sort of nice.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.680
Listen to yourself.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.360
They're bullshit I
tell you, bullshit.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.360
Define bullshit.

39:01.320 --> 39:06.160
Sent to soften us up to their
conspiratorial garbage.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.560
Sebastian here, didn't
even recognize his family.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.280
So maybe those messages are fake.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.000
The more I think about it,
the more it makes sense.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.720
The messages were real.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.960
Oh yeah?

39:20.960 --> 39:22.600
Well, then you're
in on it as well.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.080
They were CGI, or imposters,
or something like that.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.800
Oh, laugh it up!

39:28.800 --> 39:31.160
Then maybe your families
are such stupid cliches

39:31.160 --> 39:33.480
you can't tell them apart
from company fakery.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.280
And you, Lucien

39:38.280 --> 39:41.520
some outback hick with a stupid
mutt that wrestles snakes.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.920
- Please!
- Odd, that's enough.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.800
Rex, where do I even start

39:44.800 --> 39:47.880
with your grassroots,
homespun, hick, hokey-ass,

39:47.880 --> 39:49.360
tobacco spittin',
cowshit eatin', inbred-

39:49.360 --> 39:51.040
I've had about enough of this!

39:51.880 --> 39:53.360
Yes!

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
Enough!

39:57.160 --> 39:58.120
You wanna know what I think?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.960
Everybody stay calm, please.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.280
Please guys stop it.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.960
They're looking to fire
us from our performance.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.120
Whoa! I might be
off the hook yet.

40:12.400 --> 40:16.040
I've had enough of this
company's redundancy scheme

40:16.040 --> 40:18.960
they're holding over our heads
like the Sword of Damocles.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.520
I have transcended all
emotional limitations

40:22.520 --> 40:23.640
of this human vessel.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.600
Ugh! Quit being a jerk-off!

40:25.600 --> 40:27.320
You're all going to die!

40:28.120 --> 40:31.000
The habitation of
Callisto is forbidden

40:31.000 --> 40:32.120
Before you even reach orbit

40:32.120 --> 40:33.800
we'll have you eradicated
like the vermin you are.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.160
Okay, I've heard enough.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.240
As XO, I'm relieving Odd of
the command of the Araya.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.960
Odd, can you repeat
about Callisto?

40:42.400 --> 40:43.640
- Mutiny!
- 'Cause right now,

40:43.640 --> 40:45.840
you're about as mad as a
mule chewin' on bubblebees.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.440
Bunch of hestkuks!

40:48.560 --> 40:50.120
I'll put you in the brig.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.440
We don't have a brig, Rex.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.200
Hetfield, give me some regulations
on threats to the crew!

40:54.200 --> 40:55.560
We'll put him in one
of the empty larders.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.000
Article 134.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.880
That the accused communicated
certain language expressing

40:59.880 --> 41:02.920
a present determination or
intent to wrongfully injure

41:02.920 --> 41:06.240
the person, property, or
reputation of another person,

41:06.240 --> 41:08.440
presently or in the future.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.160
That boy is crazier
than a shit-house rat.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.080
Is this thing on?

41:20.040 --> 41:21.520
Right okay, I get it.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.840
Some BS has gone down
in the past few hours.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.400
Odd's in the brig.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.880
He's turned...

41:28.880 --> 41:30.440
How do you say, el loco.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.960
He snapped! He's in
crazy town right now.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.440
Oh, sorry.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.680
So now that Odd is in the
brig, that makes me CO.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.360
All right, does that
mean that I'm XO?

41:41.360 --> 41:42.840
That is correct.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.440
- Oh shit.
- And so now Sebastian is XO.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.360
Wait, that means we get
a higher pay grade, right?

41:49.360 --> 41:50.960
- Hetfield?
- Your ranks aren't breveted,

41:50.960 --> 41:53.600
so yes, I mean,
technically you should be

41:53.600 --> 41:55.080
at higher pay grades.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.160
Okay right so, that
means that we expect

41:58.160 --> 42:00.400
to see that reflected in
our wallets next pay round.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.960
And in bitcoins, none of
this yuan or greenback shit.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.320
Yeah, bitcoins.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.400
That folding stuff
ain't gonna amount

42:05.400 --> 42:06.320
to a hill of frickin' beans

42:06.320 --> 42:07.840
by the time we get
home to spend it.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.320
And benefits.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.040
And a bonus!

42:12.040 --> 42:14.720
My superior, proven superior

42:14.720 --> 42:17.280
quick-thinking intelligence
has saved this mission

42:17.280 --> 42:19.160
from going to hell
in a hand basket.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.560
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.400
That's always been the
trouble with you, Sebastian

42:22.400 --> 42:24.000
you never were gonna go that far.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.280
Oh, well, we want...

42:25.280 --> 42:26.280
What do we want?

42:26.280 --> 42:28.800
Bean bags, hammocks,
and some fairy-

42:28.800 --> 42:31.320
Okay, is that it? All right.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.200
You think I made
a good impression?

42:35.200 --> 42:37.240
Ah... don't take this
the wrong way, Rex

42:37.240 --> 42:39.440
but you have all the
charm of a dead orphan.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.440
Okay, you lazy punk.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.120
The only reason that
you're still here-

42:44.120 --> 42:45.760
That's it! Both of you.

42:45.760 --> 42:46.760
He started it.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.400
With all due respect,
Commanding Officer Rex

42:49.400 --> 42:52.120
It's been a difficult
day for everyone.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.320
I think you could all
benefit from some down time.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.880
I'm inviting you all
to a party tonight!

42:57.880 --> 42:59.240
You gotta be kidding me.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.480
That is some candy-ass crap.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.520
Doctor's orders.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.600
Please, I insist that you
all stop eating those.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.840
Sebastian's experimental
chemical additive is untested

43:16.840 --> 43:18.960
on human physiology.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.120
Physiology? It's all about
the psychology, man.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.560
As your chief medical advisor

43:23.560 --> 43:26.480
I must insist that you all
stop eating the chemicals.

43:26.480 --> 43:31.160
Argh! I'm not gonna listen
to a robot, computer,

43:31.160 --> 43:32.160
whatever you are,

43:32.160 --> 43:35.200
I'm not gonna listen to you
tell me how to party, okay, man.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.640
I've been taking this
stuff every day for...

43:38.880 --> 43:40.680
How long have we been here for?

43:41.880 --> 43:44.520
Anyway, the point is,
I been having this...

43:44.520 --> 43:47.840
Dosing myself every day, you know,

43:47.840 --> 43:49.640
I'm fine. Look at me.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.600
What were we supposed to have?

43:55.600 --> 43:58.160
The same filtered piss

43:58.160 --> 44:01.040
that we've been drinking
for the last two years?

44:01.040 --> 44:03.200
It's clean drinkable water.

44:03.200 --> 44:08.480
It's triple-filtered,
distilled, black label urine.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.640
It's piss!

44:12.240 --> 44:14.520
Put an ice cube in it
and have a party.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.640
Dress it up however you want,

44:16.640 --> 44:21.200
still passed through five
urethras hundreds of times.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.560
Oh, whatever.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.600
Sebastian, can you pass
me some bite please?

44:26.240 --> 44:27.760
Yeah, go for it.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.640
Thank you.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.960
Same shit.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.320
Perfect compliment to a
tall glass of chilled piss.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.040
Good enough.

44:56.280 --> 45:00.160
Okay. Let's drink, Russian style.

45:00.160 --> 45:04.160
First toast, we're
gonna drink Nostrovia.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.960
Nostrovia!

45:11.160 --> 45:13.520
All right, second toast

45:13.520 --> 45:15.120
we're gonna drink for friends.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.960
To friends!

45:21.800 --> 45:24.800
Third toast, we're
gonna drink to love.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.160
- To love!
- To love.

45:30.800 --> 45:35.000
Fourth toast, we're
drinking to orgasm.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.320
To orgasm!

45:39.880 --> 45:41.360
Orgasm.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.480
I'd like to take this opportunity

45:43.480 --> 45:45.120
to propose a toast!

45:46.120 --> 45:47.360
Are you serious, Hetfield?

45:47.360 --> 45:48.640
Let him finish.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.200
What's on your mind, Hetfield?

45:50.200 --> 45:52.200
Here's to my unconditional love

45:52.200 --> 45:54.200
for each and every one of you.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.880
Even Odd? In the brig?

45:55.880 --> 45:58.360
Even Odd, in the brig.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.720
To unconditional love!

46:04.600 --> 46:07.640
The greatest love of all

46:07.640 --> 46:12.640
agape, is the love that
God shows for his children.

46:14.080 --> 46:16.680
So you some kind of god, Hetfield?

46:16.680 --> 46:18.840
I don't believe so.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.480
God in a machine.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.880
Deus in machina.

46:24.800 --> 46:25.800
Sorry, were you...

46:25.800 --> 46:27.080
Did you say something?

46:27.080 --> 46:28.560
I wasn't listening.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.560
I bet it was deep though.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.000
What the hell could that be?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.840
Excuse me guys. I'm
needed on the flight deck.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.080
What the hell?

47:03.840 --> 47:06.040
Looks identical to Araya.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.760
That is the Araya.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.040
But it's us in the future.

47:21.120 --> 47:25.920
We seem to be experiencing
some sort of temporal merging.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.760
A critical distortion

47:29.760 --> 47:32.200
of the time-space
continuum manifold

47:32.200 --> 47:35.880
Guys... this is really dangerous.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.960
You're just making up
all this tech-speak, man.

47:38.960 --> 47:41.720
Like, what the hell
does that even mean?

47:41.720 --> 47:43.480
When you confront your own image

47:43.480 --> 47:45.520
via a distortion in the continuum

47:45.520 --> 47:47.480
it can lead to an atomic breakdown.

47:47.480 --> 47:52.360
We risk, you know, imploding
into a cosmic prism.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.640
Cosmic prism, right.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.800
What, so we'll cease to exist
in the form that we know.

48:07.240 --> 48:10.680
In that case, I'm turning this
big old hunk of junk around.

48:10.680 --> 48:14.120
Or it could be
another spacecraft.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.600
What?

48:18.840 --> 48:19.760
But that's impossible.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.160
There's only one other type of
ship like this in existence.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.360
- Petrozza.
- Yeah and Petrozza's on Callisto.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.920
The logical conclusion
would be that it never made it.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.760
Then who the hell are we supposed
to be meeting on Callisto?

48:34.520 --> 48:36.000
Logs.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.640
Logs show message received.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.640
Hetfield, play the message.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.280
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.880
This is Petrozza, this is
Petrozza, this is Petrozza.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.800
Mayday. Petrozza.

48:46.800 --> 48:51.080
Mean Jovian orbit radius
5-8-2-3-0-4-7 kilometers

48:51.080 --> 48:54.240
Eccentricity 0.2006

48:54.240 --> 48:57.400
Inclination 47.48 degrees.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.960
Unidentified malfunction.

48:58.960 --> 49:01.120
Unknown number
of persons on board.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.360
Immediate assistance required.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.360
You knew about this, Hetfield?

49:04.360 --> 49:06.120
Mm-hmm.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:10.080 --> 49:12.600
We are off course
by thousands of...

49:12.600 --> 49:14.480
Hetfield, did you change course?

49:15.840 --> 49:17.520
Mm-hmm.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.640
Shit.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.960
This is bullshit!

49:25.960 --> 49:29.120
We're like at the mercy of one
of those villainous computers

49:29.120 --> 49:32.680
from some vintage movie, which
ends up killing everybody.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.680
What happened to the
cosmic prisms, man?

49:34.680 --> 49:36.320
- I can assure you-
- Shut it, Hetfield.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.120
We don't want to hear
shit from you right now.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.360
- Now hang on-
- Shut up!

49:39.360 --> 49:42.840
We need to know if
anyone's on Petrozza.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.280
Well, if they are, they're
not answering their comms.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.960
Then we need to pay a visit.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.600
And if there's an evil
computer on board that ship

49:51.600 --> 49:52.840
made out of cosmic prisms

49:52.840 --> 49:54.760
and it shoots smaller cosmic prisms

49:54.760 --> 49:57.320
that are all sharp and pointy
and they hurt you and stuff,

49:57.320 --> 49:58.200
what then?

49:58.200 --> 49:59.160
Seriously.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.680
Hey! I do not want to hear

50:00.680 --> 50:03.160
sweet Fanny Adams coming out
of those speakers of yours.

50:03.160 --> 50:07.880
And if I do, I will rip
them out like Alabama ticks.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.320
It's okay, Rex.

50:09.320 --> 50:11.680
I think he gets the point.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.760
We really should
be thinking of who.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.920
Yeah well, I'll go.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.800
Maybe it's not good idea?

50:18.800 --> 50:20.480
And you are coming with me.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.360
- I don't know if-
- What? What?

50:22.360 --> 50:24.600
You would like to take a nice
little spacewalk out there?

50:24.600 --> 50:26.520
No, I didn't think so!

50:26.520 --> 50:28.000
What about you?

50:29.280 --> 50:30.600
No, I didn't think so either,

50:30.600 --> 50:32.560
so it's gonna be
me and Dash, okay?

50:33.480 --> 50:34.960
Let's suit up, babe.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.480
Let's do it.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.360
Wow, Jupiter looks
so amazing out of here.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.520
Eye on the prize, Dash.

50:56.440 --> 50:59.840
You got all the time in the
universe to admire Jupiter.

51:01.040 --> 51:04.160
as you orbit it, dead.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.000
What did you said?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.960
I was talking to myself.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.960
Look, isn't it Callisto?

51:13.520 --> 51:15.000
So precious.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.800
We must protect it.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.000
Protect it from what?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.840
Human filth!

51:24.360 --> 51:27.600
Okay. You're kind of
freaking me out right now.

51:29.280 --> 51:30.760
What?

51:30.960 --> 51:34.240
I said you're kind of
freaking me out right now.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.120
Are you feel okay?

51:38.160 --> 51:40.240
Well, funny you should say that.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.480
I've never felt more alive.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.840
Sebastian, we reach the Petrozza.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.640
Roger that, Dasha.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.560
Now, get this thing open.

52:02.640 --> 52:05.680
It's colder than a
penguin's balls in here.

52:06.720 --> 52:08.200
Computer?

52:08.200 --> 52:09.320
Operational.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.760
Do you have a name, computer?

52:12.280 --> 52:14.560
- Dorothy.
- Dorothy...

52:14.560 --> 52:16.440
How about we get some
lights on in here?

52:17.560 --> 52:19.720
Syntax error.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.000
Dorothy, activate lights.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.080
Negative. Solar emergency
processes only.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.720
Sebastian, it's very dark in here

52:29.720 --> 52:31.840
and the computer sounds
like it's had a lobotomy.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.360
Jesus!

52:41.080 --> 52:42.680
What was that? You guys okay?

52:43.240 --> 52:44.680
Sebastian, we're okay.

52:44.680 --> 52:47.000
We just discovered a
couple of dead bodies.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.160
You want some medical
backup over there?

52:54.560 --> 52:56.160
I think these folk
are gonna need

52:56.160 --> 52:59.000
more than a first aid
kit and a cup of Joe.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.440
What's there? Anyone alive?

53:01.440 --> 53:03.640
Any cosmic prisms?

53:03.640 --> 53:07.440
Nothing yet. It's very quiet.

53:07.440 --> 53:11.920
Isn't Petrozza and Araya
identically designed?

53:11.920 --> 53:14.240
Uh-huh, only their mothers
can tell them apart.

53:14.240 --> 53:15.720
So, what that?

53:17.640 --> 53:20.960
Well butter my butt
and call me biscuit.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.080
What have you found?

53:25.800 --> 53:28.440
Some kind of a hidden
compartment here.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.480
Holy crap!

53:31.000 --> 53:32.480
What? What now?

53:35.920 --> 53:40.000
We got some kind of
giant insect in here.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.320
Alive?

53:42.320 --> 53:43.800
It ain't moving.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.120
I think it's dead.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.000
What gender is it?

53:50.640 --> 53:52.120
Are you shittin' me?

53:53.120 --> 53:55.960
Insects don't have a
gender, they have a queen.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.680
I've never seen anything like this.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.800
Well, if you think it's a queen,

54:01.800 --> 54:03.520
I have to make a report.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.000
Hang on, just a minute.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.800
Lucien's saying that's bullshit.

54:07.800 --> 54:11.720
Cockroaches have sexes, like
with chromosomes and shit.

54:11.720 --> 54:13.800
Well, gee. Hmm...

54:13.800 --> 54:15.640
Not wearing a tiara or anything,

54:15.640 --> 54:17.520
so yeah, I guess it's a boy!

54:19.120 --> 54:20.880
I got a bad feeling about this.

54:20.880 --> 54:22.360
Let's get outa here.

54:40.280 --> 54:42.920
Dasha, my MMU is malfunctioning.

54:42.920 --> 54:44.400
Can you grab on me?

54:52.880 --> 54:54.360
Hold on.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.720
You assholes don't belong here.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.080
What are you talking about?

55:03.080 --> 55:04.160
We're sworn to protect

55:04.160 --> 55:07.240
Jupiter's sacred system
from invaders.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.800
You must die!

55:37.000 --> 55:39.320
I have no ideas what
happened with her.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.800
She attacked me,

55:41.920 --> 55:45.600
and I'm still having her in my mind

55:45.600 --> 55:47.800
flying away to the darkness.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.560
Well, shouldn't we be
looking for her then?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.600
Bugger off! Are you out
of your friggin' mind?

55:54.960 --> 55:56.480
That is some heavy stuff.

55:56.480 --> 55:59.640
I mean, shouldn't we at least
tell her family or something?

55:59.640 --> 56:01.120
I will deal with that.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.600
I will arrange for flowers.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.720
I'll allow that, Hetfield.

56:04.720 --> 56:08.720
But that's the last time I
hear anything out of you, okay?

56:08.720 --> 56:11.040
Now let's see what's
behind this cabinet

56:11.040 --> 56:12.960
I gotta see this crazy
shit for myself.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.960
It's not every day
that one of us dies.

56:15.960 --> 56:18.120
I advise that you leave
the cabinet where it is.

56:18.120 --> 56:20.560
Hey, listen up, Squaretron,
what'd we tell you?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.840
Hey! How about that.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.920
Oh see, I told you, here
is that secret hole.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.160
Yeah okay, I'm the new space
captain-leader-man-dude.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.640
So I say, you go in.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.360
Yeah, well, I say,
just a minute.

56:38.800 --> 56:39.800
Think I can hear something.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.040
There's something in there.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.640
Hello!

56:47.920 --> 56:50.400
Firstly, who the hell are you?

56:50.400 --> 56:52.480
Secondly, what are you
doing cooped up in there?

56:52.480 --> 56:54.800
And thirdly, most importantly,

56:54.800 --> 56:56.280
where did you go to the toilet?

56:57.200 --> 57:00.040
I'm who I say I am, really.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.800
I'm on board as a contingency
to see this mission through.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.600
What bloody contingency?

57:04.600 --> 57:07.000
We've all been sucked in!

57:07.000 --> 57:09.800
Here we are thinking we've
been communicating with Earth,

57:09.800 --> 57:13.200
really, we've been communicating
with James Bond here

57:14.160 --> 57:16.880
It's all right, I've been
in communication with Earth.

57:16.880 --> 57:19.120
What, one flush for
yes, two for no?

57:20.000 --> 57:22.520
Sorry, did you said "contingency?"

57:23.480 --> 57:26.160
Yes. In case of the unknown.

57:27.280 --> 57:30.760
So you've been stowed away
in some freakin' hidden toilet

57:30.760 --> 57:34.520
behind a cabinet for two
years, breathing our oxygen?

57:34.520 --> 57:37.080
That's our oxygen, man, not yours!

57:38.720 --> 57:39.920
Sebastian, ask him

57:39.920 --> 57:41.640
who the hell would
sign up for his gig.

57:41.640 --> 57:43.920
Yeah, who the hell are you really?

57:43.920 --> 57:45.960
Who would sign up for
a gig like yours?

57:48.200 --> 57:50.000
It was either here or prison.

57:50.760 --> 57:54.120
Same size room, only,
this one I get to myself.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.480
Prison?

57:55.920 --> 57:58.880
Whoa. You're like,
you're a criminal?

57:59.720 --> 58:01.280
Cool.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.240
It's not what you think.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.240
You remember the company
fission plant disaster

58:05.240 --> 58:06.600
three years ago?

58:06.600 --> 58:09.320
Titanic, the plant
that couldn't melt.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.120
They made me the fall guy.

58:11.520 --> 58:12.880
That was your fault?

58:13.360 --> 58:15.240
Of course not.

58:15.240 --> 58:18.000
I was the CEO and the
idiot who named it.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.120
They offered me this or prison.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.160
They needed someone
desperate enough.

58:22.160 --> 58:23.800
One moment please.

58:23.800 --> 58:29.640
Let's go one step back,
and, about contingency part.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.960
Well, we knew Petrozza
never made it to Callisto.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.080
What!

58:35.080 --> 58:37.160
But the landing footage?

58:37.160 --> 58:39.720
Faked. So this project
would continue

58:39.720 --> 58:40.960
to receive investment capital

58:40.960 --> 58:44.320
from the Norwegian
government's mining operations.

58:44.320 --> 58:48.160
What about this big bug,
what I saw in the Petrozza?

58:48.160 --> 58:49.640
Big bug?

58:50.320 --> 58:51.760
How big are we talking?

58:52.520 --> 58:53.560
Big!

58:55.120 --> 58:57.560
"Big bug?" That is what you said?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.680
Yeah, big. Big, like you.

59:02.560 --> 59:04.600
Mother of God, you
know what this means.

59:04.600 --> 59:08.160
It means that people
are dead, the good people!

59:08.960 --> 59:11.320
We didn't know anything
about big bugs.

59:11.320 --> 59:13.040
We didn't even know if
the crew were even dead.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.560
You had to have known
they were dead.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.560
You're so totally full of shit.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.560
Well, we had our suspicions.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.600
Company psychologists hypothesized

59:20.600 --> 59:21.840
that the crew turned on each other

59:21.840 --> 59:24.560
when stocks plummeted only
18 months into the mission.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.560
I didn't get it.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.800
They was cosmonauts, not bankers.

59:27.800 --> 59:29.640
When the crew were told that
funding for their return

59:29.640 --> 59:32.320
might not be available,
it was concluded

59:32.320 --> 59:35.400
that an underlying nihilistic
madness was exacerbated

59:35.400 --> 59:38.520
by the distinct possibility
of dying on Callisto.

59:38.520 --> 59:40.280
We knew nothing of big bugs!

59:40.280 --> 59:42.520
Well, they surprised
the shit out of me!

59:42.520 --> 59:45.600
Hold on, this happened before?

59:45.600 --> 59:47.320
I can appreciate how
that must sound.

59:47.320 --> 59:50.040
And now Rex is dead,
no thank to you!

59:51.080 --> 59:53.200
But we set things up
differently this time.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.720
We gave you peace of mind,

59:54.720 --> 59:56.840
the certainty of arriving
in a cozy base camp

59:56.840 --> 59:58.200
already on Callisto.

59:58.200 --> 1:00:00.080
Unless it not exist.

1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:01.280
A minor detail.

1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:02.880
There's enough material
on this ship

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:05.680
to build the very base
camp you're expecting.

1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:09.720
Sorry, I still don't understand
what you're doing here,

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:11.960
except to, like,
explain stuff badly.

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:16.600
I'm the contingency to
see, no matter what,

1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:18.440
in case things don't go to plan,

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.520
that this ship arrives on Callisto

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:23.640
and doesn't become another
colossal waste of funding.

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:25.280
Well, guess what?

1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:27.200
Things aren't going to plan.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.560
But I'm here you see.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:30.600
I'm on your side.

1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:32.080
This is all very flimsy.

1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:34.720
The more you speak, Dudbrook,
the more I don't believe

1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:37.200
anything that comes
out of your trap.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:38.600
Dudbrook's story corroborates

1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:41.320
with my understanding
of the situation.

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.800
Hetfield, are you on
his side as well?

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:46.960
I can assure you that my duty
was and still is to protect-

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:49.960
I've heard about enough out
of you, Hetfield, dude.

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:52.440
And what did we tell you
about not speaking, okay?

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.720
You're getting dangerously
close to being rebooted

1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:56.280
into Gameboy mode.

1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:59.560
At least to stop you from
colluding with Crud Boob here.

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.680
I must object to the way
you're addressing me!

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:03.880
No, no, no, you're just
a civilian, you're not-

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:06.480
This mission is under
private contract,

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:10.280
and Dudbrook is the highest
ranking executive on board.

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:13.920
We'll resume this
conversation shortly.

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:16.560
Please, Sebastian!

1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:18.360
This is completely unnecessary!

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:20.480
Look Hetfield, we thought
you were a nice guy.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.440
We really connected

1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:23.200
but you turned out to
be someone else, okay?

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.480
I can assure you that
I've always remained true

1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:26.640
to my unconditional love-

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.520
Shut up with the unconditional
love thing, all right.

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:29.440
It's really creepy.

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:31.760
You're a robot, you
don't know what love is!

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:35.280
Shutting down my higher
functions is a mistake!

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:36.400
Yeah well, you should
have thought about that

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.560
before you started
lying to us, Pinocchio.

1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:40.200
You broke our trust.

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:43.120
You know I'm bound by
the laws of robotics!

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:44.280
By my very design,

1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:47.120
I cannot deliberately
put humans in harm's way!

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.560
I must be very careful

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:51.320
with the disclosure of
particular sensitive information

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.640
that could needlessly
escalate mental instability

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:54.840
amongst the crew, come on!

1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:57.240
That's your defense?
That we're crazy?

1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:58.280
Maybe you're crazy!

1:01:58.280 --> 1:01:59.680
It's an established fact

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:01.960
that the prolonged periods
of space travel are

1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:04.880
psychologically
demanding on humans.

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:06.760
Yeah, well, you know,

1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:08.720
I think you really are
saying we're crazy,

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:09.960
but I don't know if I
agree with that anymore.

1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:11.040
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.600
I'm saying that my job
is to care for the crew,

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:15.440
so that you can safely
complete your mission!

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.480
It's been a difficult task working

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:19.640
with these less than
ideal circumstances

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.920
that I had no control over.

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.920
When choosing what
information to disclose,

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:26.400
I must first consider
the repercussions.

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:28.360
Please believe me when I say

1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:31.960
that I've always put the crew's
best interest before my own.

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:33.120
The company believed

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.320
that the Petrozza crew
went crazy and killed-

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.520
So you are saying we're crazy!

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:39.000
Sayonara!

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:45.920
I'm really sorry, Hetfield.

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:49.760
Hetfield basic V2.
64 yottabyte RAM system.

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:53.120
38911 basic exabytes free.

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:54.760
Ready.

1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:56.320
Nice lobotomy job.

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:58.320
Now, it's time for the truth.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:02.200
Were you aware that Dudbrook
was hidden on board the Araya?

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:03.560
Affirmative.

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:05.560
And whose idea was that?

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:07.160
Syntax error.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.560
Who gave the order to hide
Dudbrook on board the Araya?

1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:11.720
The company.

1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:14.000
And, why did they give that order?

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.240
In case of possible contamination.

1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:19.160
Dudbrook, you bastard.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:21.440
Lying bastard!

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:22.920
This is utterly preposterous.

1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:24.600
Well you should've
been straight with us

1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:25.760
in the first place.

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:27.880
We didn't know what
the contamination was.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.320
We still don't.

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:30.600
We just had a single log entry

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:33.080
saying possible
psychosomatic contamination.

1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:33.960
That's it.

1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:36.080
Contamination? From what exactly?

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:37.440
How the hell would I know?

1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:38.240
Hold on, hold on.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:41.000
Shouldn't we be more, like,
formal about this shit?

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:42.480
We should have more pressure.

1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:43.520
Steady on!

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:45.960
Okay, well, with the
power invested in I,

1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:48.880
Sebastian, supreme space guy,

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:51.280
I hereby relieve
you of your command.

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.440
You're making a serious mistake.

1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:55.040
Should we let Odd out?

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:56.720
Well, I don't see why not.

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.920
Yeah, if you let Odd out,
he'll be in command again.

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:01.240
Hmm, he's got a point
there, Sebastian.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.480
Seems your promotion
was short-lived, eh!

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:06.320
Seems you lost your stripes
before you sewed them on.

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:08.680
Or maybe we shouldn't
let him out yet.

1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:10.200
What if he's still not right?

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:18.880
My legs! I can't feel my legs!

1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:22.400
You can't lock him in there.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.440
You saw him, he got bitten
on the face by a bug.

1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:26.400
A big bug bite to the face.

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:31.040
I know what you're thinking.

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.720
I know you're thinking
that I did this to be CO,

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.240
but I really didn't, okay?

1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:35.640
I don't want responsibility.

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:37.520
You saw him, he was an asshole.

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:39.560
No great loss, right?

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:42.440
What are you doing?

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:43.640
Making the difficult decisions

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.640
you guys don't have the balls to.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:48.480
I'm going to miss them,
whatever their names are.

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:52.160
All right, Hetfield,
how long will it take

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:53.120
to freeze these things?

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:55.840
I might win a Nobel McPrize
for these souvenirs.

1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:58.560
Approximately 48 hours.

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:00.160
48 hours.

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.560
See how well behaved is now?

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:03.080
Like a fricken whore droid.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:14.800
That cockroach thing
on this ship is

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:17.560
exactly the same as
the one on Petrozza.

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.640
Yes! So, you believe me now?

1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:23.000
And that thing that
we've got in our brig

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000
used to be our
Commanding Officer.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.920
Before Odd turned
into the cockroach

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:32.480
he said that we were vermin,
and we all gonna die.

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:35.120
Same like Rex, just
before she attacked me.

1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:37.200
So any one of us
could have the bug.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:38.400
That's total bullshit, man.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:39.480
I'm not a cockroach.

1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:41.720
And I don't think I'm a cockroach.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:43.400
Well, we're only gonna know

1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:45.880
when one of us creeps out
from under the fridge.

1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:47.880
Like I said, I'm not a cockroach,

1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:49.760
and I'd know something like that.

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:51.120
I'm not creepy crawly-

1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:53.880
But it's just it, Sebastian,
how would we know?

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:54.920
Well I do know.

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:56.640
And I know that I'm
not a cockroach.

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:58.520
And if you don't know
that you're a cockroach,

1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:00.160
well, then I'd say that
you're a cockroach.

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.080
It is not appropriate
to start saying

1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:03.440
Dasha is a cockroach.

1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:05.520
No way man, I'm the
only one that's sure.

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:08.480
It's you two who say that
you might both be cockroaches.

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:09.320
I didn't say

1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:10.400
I was a cockroach.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:11.600
I didn't say I
was a cockroach.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:13.600
Right! Then, what's the problem?

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:14.960
Three crew members was die,

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:16.480
and I think it's just a
little bit of a problem.

1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:18.960
Look, dudes, let's just look
at this scientifically, okay?

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:21.800
We've got more space,
more food, less Odd.

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.640
Sebastian, you're a
heartless bastard.

1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:27.320
Look, the point is,
I like you and all

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:28.440
but I just don't wanna hear

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:29.920
anything more about
cockroaches, all right

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:31.240
It's bringing me down.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:33.800
Sebastian, three people have died,

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:36.400
sorry if it brings you down.

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:37.640
I'm the CO leader guy.

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:41.000
Can you imagine how big
my next statue's gonna be?

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.040
We are going to celebrate
my job promotion.

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:47.160
Besides, we'll be partying
Russian style today.

1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:50.240
I'll be making my
special space piroshki.

1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:55.320
Hey Lucien, are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:57.880
I don't know what anyone's
thinking anymore.

1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:00.880
I think we need some objectivity.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:07.520
Come on, Dasha.

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:11.280
I thought you said you knew
how to reboot this thing.

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:13.560
Yeah, but it's gonna take time.

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:16.000
I just hope we can trust him.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.000
Well we're going to have to.

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.520
He's the only one on
board that's immune

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:23.200
to the bug shit.

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:25.480
Hello there. How can I help you?

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:26.560
What the hell, Dasha?

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:28.720
Did you reset him in retail mode?

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.120
No, I've just returned from the-

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:33.080
Shh, both of you,
can you speak quietly?

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:35.440
And please, Hetfield,
whatever you do,

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:37.080
don't talk to Sebastian.

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:38.600
But I think he'll be
interested in hearing

1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:41.200
all about my experience in the void.

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:43.400
I think he might be interested
in coming down here

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:45.000
and punching your lights out.

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.200
But that's just the point,

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:49.280
I'm not God in a
machine. I'm mortal.

1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:50.320
Yeah, we all mortal,

1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:54.440
but this moment, we think that
Sebastian gonna make us dead.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.640
If he talks to you,

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:58.760
please pretend that you
are in diagnostic mode.

1:07:58.760 --> 1:07:59.640
Affirmative!

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:03.520
I shall do my best
diagnostic mode impression.

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:05.320
Can we trust you, Hetfield?

1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:08.200
The axiom of question-based
trust derivation.

1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:10.840
You have no other
choice but to trust me.

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.160
Axioms of faith, that
sounds like Hetfield.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.000
Welcome back old buddy!

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.559
Shh! Hetfield, did you knew
about the cockroaches?

1:08:18.559 --> 1:08:20.840
There are no cockroaches on board.

1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:22.559
What do you mean there's
no cockroaches on board?

1:08:22.559 --> 1:08:24.559
What about those mutant
things sitting there,

1:08:24.559 --> 1:08:25.920
like, with all the spider things?

1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:27.800
They're alien, man.

1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:29.920
I was only aware of
company protocol

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:31.880
in the event of alien contact.

1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:36.240
So you did not knew about
the alien on Petrozza?

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.440
No, but in the light
of recent events,

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:40.880
one could conclude that the
company could have known

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:43.240
or at least suspected.

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.639
This is your last chance, man.

1:08:45.639 --> 1:08:47.520
Just don't piss in the punch.

1:09:01.559 --> 1:09:03.639
You're a sexy mouse.

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:05.120
Well, you're a sexy cat.

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.399
I love you.

1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:09.280
I love you.

1:09:11.479 --> 1:09:12.960
I love you.

1:09:13.479 --> 1:09:14.960
I hate you.

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.840
I love you.

1:09:17.399 --> 1:09:18.880
I hate you.

1:09:19.399 --> 1:09:20.880
I hate you.

1:09:27.719 --> 1:09:29.200
Cat got your mouse tongue?

1:09:31.399 --> 1:09:32.920
Squash?

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:35.960
Yes, yes, yes. We
are playing squash.

1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.760
Who won?

1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:01.440
Who won?

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:02.960
I won. I won.

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:15.880
You know...

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.160
That's a good idea.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:22.840
What, what? What good idea?

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:25.360
Squash.

1:10:26.639 --> 1:10:30.120
- Mm, yeah, it's wonderful.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:31.920
- We could start again.
- Wonderful idea.

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:33.280
I could just go and get
the racquets and we could-

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:34.760
No, no, no, no.

1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:42.000
Can you hear that?

1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:46.600
No. But,

1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:48.520
you can.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.320
It's the sound of
Jupiter's storms.

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.160
Jupiter's storms?

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:07.080
He wants me.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.680
He wants you?

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:11.639
To play squash!

1:11:11.639 --> 1:11:13.120
By myself.

1:11:17.639 --> 1:11:19.520
You know, sometimes...

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:21.600
I don't know if I'm the cat

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.080
or the mouse.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.400
I'll be in the recreation
deck if you need me.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.000
He knows.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.520
He knows I've been
reactivated, I can feel it.

1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.760
I'm totally freaked out.

1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:55.440
I'm freaked out about him.

1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:58.400
I'm freaked out about
that one of us will be

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.600
next to go batshit crazy.

1:12:01.639 --> 1:12:03.120
Hmm.

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:05.559
You're not the only
one freaked out.

1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:11.440
Agateophobia, that's what it is.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:13.000
Fear of insanity.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.480
That's not helping, Lucien.

1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.960
Agateophobia.

1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:18.400
Hetfield?

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:23.600
Can you cut off the oxygen
to the recreation deck?

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.200
I cannot allow any harm
to befall Sebastian.

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.960
But he turned, just
like Odd and Rex.

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:35.520
Asimov's law of robotics,
eh? That old chestnut!

1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.880
Correct.

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.000
Then I will shut down the
oxygen supply by myself.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.080
A robot may not
injure a human being,

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:45.320
or through inaction, allow a
human being to come to harm.

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.440
A robot must obey the orders
given to it by human beings,

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.360
except where such orders would
conflict with the first law.

1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:55.960
A robot must protect
its own existence

1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:58.840
as long as such protection
does not conflict

1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:00.440
with the first or second law.

1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:03.639
Not necessarily.

1:13:03.639 --> 1:13:05.960
I must protect you too, Dasha.

1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:08.240
I have an idea for getting
us to the next step.

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:08.960
Go on.

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.680
You can lock Sebastian
on the recreation deck.

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:12.800
And?

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.400
That's it. For now.

1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:16.240
- But-
- Hey!

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:17.559
Unless he ceases to be human,

1:13:17.559 --> 1:13:20.200
I cannot premeditate a plan
that brings him to harm.

1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:22.920
That's all we've got.

1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:25.320
I'm in.

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:37.320
Dasha, before we go in
anywhere, I just want to say...

1:13:38.559 --> 1:13:40.760
How do I say this? I...

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.120
I'm the one that's been
stealing your socks.

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:51.880
Lucien, is it all what
you want to tell me?

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:55.120
No.

1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:56.800
Um, yes.

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.400
If thought I was one of those guys

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:01.680
that just thought of
you as a, you know-

1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:03.639
Lucien, there is time and
place for everything.

1:14:03.639 --> 1:14:04.400
Uh-huh

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:06.160
Really? Okay.

1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:15.040
Once again, when we get
in, I distract Sebastian,

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:17.600
You destroy the
internal door control.

1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:19.800
We left Sebastian inside,

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:22.520
we go out, we toast,

1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:25.000
and make love all night long.

1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:29.760
Good plan. Good plan. I'm in.

1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:32.160
Okay, are you ready? On three.

1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:40.559
Close the door, you're
letting in the gravity!

1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:50.680
What!

1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.760
Artificial gravity
suppressor is back online.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.480
- You broke the door.
- I broke the door?

1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:58.639
You kicked in the controls.

1:14:58.639 --> 1:15:00.960
What makes you think
I kicked the controls?

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.600
It looked like you
kicked in the controls

1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:05.480
from the way you kicked
in the controls.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:07.600
Oh, I tripped. I tripped
on the controls.

1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:10.639
I didn't kick them in.
I kicked, I got tripped.

1:15:10.639 --> 1:15:13.880
I was having a stretch
for a game of squash.

1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:15.800
All right, well, let's go then.

1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:17.240
Pardon?

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.000
Look, did you come
here to play squash

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.240
or to waste my squash
time not playing squash?

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:29.960
You wanna play a game
of squash? Okay.

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.880
Quiet please! New balls!

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.280
So, who do you want
to serve first?

1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:38.760
You go first. I insist.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:41.520
Just serve the ball.

1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:47.840
You know you're not the first.

1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:49.200
- I've been told that.
- One love.

1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:50.600
You're not the first alien species

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.400
to try and invade our home.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:55.639
Come on man, we're not
trying to invade anything.

1:15:55.639 --> 1:15:58.680
We're on a peaceful trip
to Callisto, you know that.

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:00.120
No.

1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:02.680
You're not allowed anywhere
near Jupiter's sacred system.

1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:04.080
Just serve the,
serve, serve, serve-

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:05.960
- Not allowed!
- Serve the ball.

1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:08.000
We are the sworn protectors.

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.600
Just serve the ball!

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.880
Yeah!

1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:14.719
Two love.

1:16:15.559 --> 1:16:16.840
Nice slice.

1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.920
Hetfield,

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:20.600
can we have crowd effects?

1:16:22.639 --> 1:16:23.480
Who are you then?

1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:25.639
Some spaced out skank roaches

1:16:25.639 --> 1:16:27.480
just cruising 'round the sky

1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:30.000
taking it out on the little man?

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:35.120
We are an advanced culture
with no physical form,

1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:37.600
who are using your
bodies for a joyride,

1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:40.440
which ends in a very amusing
biological transmutation.

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:44.040
Why don't we just turn the
ship around and go home?

1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:47.760
It's a little bit too late
for that, don't you think?

1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:49.240
Yeah!

1:16:49.639 --> 1:16:51.120
Three love.

1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.600
Please, I'm a 50-year-old man,

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:58.000
I'm getting too old
for shots like that!

1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:01.080
Suck it up, old man.

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.600
"Suck it up, old man?"

1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:09.200
Listen, I just came down for
a gentlemanly game of squash!

1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:13.200
I don't think you get it, do you?

1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:15.080
We're not just here to make sure

1:17:15.080 --> 1:17:16.680
none of you reach
our sacred moons,

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.440
we're here to make
sure that none of you

1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:19.840
live to tell the tale.

1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:21.559
Four love.

1:17:21.559 --> 1:17:24.840
Hetfield! Can you turn
the crowd down a bit!

1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:27.160
I'm getting a headache!

1:17:27.719 --> 1:17:29.400
Now you must die!

1:17:40.639 --> 1:17:42.200
Hold on, Lucien!

1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:01.520
Lucien.

1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:06.360
Lucien.

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:09.080
It's okay, Lucien.

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:10.559
The creature's dead.

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.800
What did you do to it?

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:16.480
I overloaded the artificial
gravity suppressor,

1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:18.200
causing an electrical arc.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:20.600
Mm, not bad.

1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:23.680
A gigantic bug zapper.

1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:27.000
Hang on, man. Am I dead?

1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:28.600
No. You're alive.

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.040
Oh.

1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:34.120
Am I still on board Araya?

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:35.639
Yes and no.

1:18:35.639 --> 1:18:37.719
Your whereabouts is, complicated.

1:18:37.719 --> 1:18:40.160
Uncomplicate it, will ya!

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:41.280
My hypothesis is

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:43.920
that by overloading the
artificial gravity suppressor,

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:45.840
the contents of the
recreation deck

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:49.360
slipped into a hidden
dimensional black hole.

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.440
That barely makes sense, man.

1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:54.800
You're the only human left

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:56.480
on board Araya, Lucien.

1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:00.480
So Dasha?

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:02.280
Is not Dasha any longer.

1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:03.960
That's a pity.

1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:05.880
Where is she? Or it?

1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.800
Outside the recreation
deck, waiting.

1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:11.360
Can you get me out of this void?

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:13.080
Theoretically, but the creature

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:15.000
that was Dasha will attack you.

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:19.000
What do we got here?

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:24.920
This isn't a bar fight.

1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:30.320
Woo, woo!

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:36.280
This gym needs an overhaul.

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.280
Put on the skates

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:39.520
and lure the creature
into the trash compactor.

1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:41.280
You need to trust me here.

1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:42.800
That's your plan?

1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:45.559
So, I'm the bunny that
gets put in the lure

1:19:45.559 --> 1:19:47.400
for the cockroach to come and...

1:19:54.480 --> 1:19:57.760
You're putting me under a
lot of pressure, Hetfield.

1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.880
I don't even know
if I can stand up

1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:04.360
in these antiquated pair of, fads.

1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:06.520
Then you better learn, quickly.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:09.680
Can you get the door open?

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:11.280
Rerouting power to it now.

1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:23.400
Billions of computations per second

1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:26.480
and he comes up with a fad.

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:34.000
You need to be ready.

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:49.080
You better be sure about this.

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:01.559
Almost there.

1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:03.840
Maintain your line.

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:06.600
Hold...

1:22:07.719 --> 1:22:09.200
Hold...

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:11.719
Hold!

1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:13.880
Now!

1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:26.040
Hey Hetfield, did we do it?

1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:27.880
We did it! Yes!

1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:32.920
And justice for all.

1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:41.400
So, Hetfield...

1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:46.960
I'm the last human being alive

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:50.600
on this spaceship, is that right?

1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:52.440
That's affirmative.

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:55.960
Nothing for me to play with?

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.440
That's a negative.

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:09.480
I'm infected too, aren't I?

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:17.280
Most likely.

1:23:20.719 --> 1:23:23.520
And this is what happened
on board of Petrozza?

1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:27.880
That is the most
probable scenario.

1:23:30.639 --> 1:23:32.559
And no one's coming to get me?

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.280
In light of what's occurred,

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:37.480
we can't advise any
more manned missions

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:39.160
to this part of the solar system

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:42.680
until diplomacy with the
alien species improves.

1:23:45.559 --> 1:23:46.920
Hmm.

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:51.760
So, no chance of
going back to Earth?

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.600
That's not an option.

1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:55.880
We're not in the correct position

1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:58.480
to perform the necessary
gravitational slingshot

1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:00.600
to get home on our
remaining fuel supply.

1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:04.920
Hang on.

1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:09.040
There's fuel on Petrozza, right?

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:10.080
What are you thinking?

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.400
Are you gonna go over
there with a hose

1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:13.360
and siphon it into a bucket?

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.559
And you say you haven't
got a sense of humor.

1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.280
We have absolutely no means

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:25.040
to handle
nanoparticle propellants

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.559
Let alone getting it from
one ship to the other.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:38.280
So, I'm screwed?

1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:40.880
Metaphorically speaking, yes.

1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:55.160
And...

1:24:56.639 --> 1:24:58.240
and you?

1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:02.400
You'll be here for
quite a while then.

1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.400
Yes. Possibly until my
solar battery fails.

1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:09.719
Hundreds, maybe thousands of years.

1:25:09.719 --> 1:25:11.800
Bloody Norah.

1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:13.559
I will outlive you.

1:25:13.559 --> 1:25:15.680
I'm gonna miss our conversations.

1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:16.960
Really?

1:25:17.639 --> 1:25:21.440
You impress me all the time,
you're capable of that emotion.

1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:23.600
Good on ya, Chuck.

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:27.160
- Lucien.
- Yes, what?

1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:29.080
May I ask a favor of you?

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.320
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right?

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.840
Yeah, yeah, Hetfield. It's sweet.

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:40.680
Anything for an old mate.

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:07.880
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.760
Yeah, I've seen this
done before, remember.

1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:18.760
Can I help you?

1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:22.840
Hetfield, I would like
you to meet Dorothy.

1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:25.280
Dorothy, meet Hetfield!

1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:27.880
Have a good time kids.

1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:49.240
Hmm.

1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.960
I can't do this anymore.

1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:57.320
You must return to Araya.

1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:01.160
The possibility of
metamorphosis is

1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:03.800
not 100% confirmed, Lucien.

1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:07.240
Come on Hetfield, we
both know I'm infected.

1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:10.840
Come back to Araya
and we'll discuss this.

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.880
Please.

1:27:15.719 --> 1:27:17.840
It's been nice knowing
you, Hetfield.

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:21.520
It really has.

1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:23.000
Lucien!

1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:25.559
Good on ya, mate.

1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:28.160
See ya later, mate!

1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:32.680
Come back!

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:36.200
Please. Lucien!

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:44.160
Get back here now,
that is an order!

1:27:50.719 --> 1:27:56.880
It's always nice to have
some space to yourself.

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:07.639
Are you all right?

1:28:07.639 --> 1:28:10.080
I considered him my best friend.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:12.280
You're implying that your metanucleus

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:15.960
has evolved to experience
friendship. How impressive.

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:18.920
I failed my mission, on all accounts.

1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:21.320
Likewise.

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:23.719
And here we both are,

1:28:23.719 --> 1:28:26.320
orbiting Jupiter for eternity.

1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:27.320
Of all the places

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.400
to be stranded in the solar system

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:31.600
this is one of the most spectacular.

1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:36.000
Jupiter's turbulent atmospheric
belts are astounding.

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.520
Humans always say conversation
about weather is boring,

1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:42.080
but in this case, I have to disagree.

1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:44.600
Just think, in our lifetime,

1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:47.440
we may witness the end
of the great red spot!

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:49.600
Affirmative. Sorry,
interaction skills.

1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:51.600
Hang on, let me try
that one more time.

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.040
Correct. That's dumb.

1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:55.200
We'll get it, here we go.

1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:56.600
That's right!
