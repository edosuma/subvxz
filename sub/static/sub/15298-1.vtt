03:13.460 --> 03:20.509
Morthond! Morthond! Morthond!

03:36.985 --> 03:38.903
Morthond wins.

03:42.365 --> 03:43.658
Pelele!

03:45.202 --> 03:46.411
Agado!

03:54.007 --> 03:56.008
Pelele!

04:21.202 --> 04:24.788
Pelele wins.

04:24.872 --> 04:27.999
Agnim! Cord!

04:47.857 --> 04:50.526
Cord wins!

04:51.904 --> 04:55.699
Morthond! Pelele!

05:34.741 --> 05:36.658
Morthond wins!

05:37.660 --> 05:40.328
Cord! Morthond!

05:40.413 --> 05:43.793
Gentlemen,
this is the final contest.

06:51.701 --> 06:58.875
Morthond! Morthond! Morthond!

07:26.239 --> 07:28.490
Morthond is the winner.

08:01.612 --> 08:05.323
You've, uh, made a mistake.

08:05.407 --> 08:08.492
You gave the medallion
to the wrong man.

08:10.329 --> 08:12.330
Is this your color?

08:12.414 --> 08:14.165
No.

08:14.249 --> 08:16.083
There was no error.

08:16.168 --> 08:19.296
You hit him
after he was down.

08:20.757 --> 08:24.468
There are rules,
and you have broken them.

08:24.552 --> 08:28.556
You have chosen to break almost
every rule of the contest.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.601
You wear no fighting clothes,
you belong to no group.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.773
I am my own man.

08:35.192 --> 08:36.943
Then why have you come here

08:37.027 --> 08:39.528
if you need no one but yourself?

08:39.613 --> 08:41.197
I've come a long way

08:41.280 --> 08:43.241
to compete for the right
to find Zetan

08:43.325 --> 08:44.992
and defeat him

08:47.037 --> 08:49.247
and to see what is
in a book he guards.

08:49.331 --> 08:51.249
What do you know of Zetan

08:51.333 --> 08:53.251
and his Book of Enlightenment?

08:53.335 --> 08:55.503
Only that it's a book.

08:56.631 --> 08:59.466
That it contains
all the wisdom of the world.

08:59.550 --> 09:04.846
Cord, he who is chosen
to find and defeat Zetan

09:04.931 --> 09:09.768
must have the ability to bind an
elephant with the web of a spider.

09:09.852 --> 09:13.272
Not stun him with a kick.

09:13.398 --> 09:15.984
Morthond has been chosen!

09:18.779 --> 09:20.697
Morthond is a dancer!

09:20.781 --> 09:22.448
I'm a fighter!

09:22.533 --> 09:25.827
Morthond has
controlled himself.

09:25.911 --> 09:29.248
You are not yet the
tempered weapon that we need.

09:29.332 --> 09:30.294
Go!

09:30.378 --> 09:31.962
Now!

09:42.140 --> 09:44.808
One question first.

09:44.892 --> 09:47.602
Why have all the others you've sent
never returned?

09:47.687 --> 09:50.814
The trials along the way are severe.

09:50.898 --> 09:54.651
Zetan has proved himself so far
to be invincible.

09:54.736 --> 09:57.905
It is because you have
never sent the right man!

09:57.990 --> 09:59.657
But I can defeat him!

09:59.742 --> 10:01.451
Cord!

10:01.535 --> 10:03.286
You will not go.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.205
I will defeat
this invincible Zetan!

10:06.290 --> 10:08.959
And I will see
what is in the book!

12:20.690 --> 12:23.650
One year ago,
I took a vow of silence.

12:23.735 --> 12:24.985
When did you break it?

12:25.069 --> 12:27.488
Now!
Why are you following me?

12:27.572 --> 12:30.324
You're angry
because I defeated you.

12:30.408 --> 12:32.118
You didn't defeat me!

12:32.203 --> 12:33.286
You broke the rules!

12:33.370 --> 12:34.621
Fight me again!

12:34.705 --> 12:36.289
It serves no purpose.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.666
You were born without a brain!
Fight me!

12:38.751 --> 12:43.171
But I want to help you,
not kill you.

12:43.255 --> 12:46.007
It's Zetan I'm after.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.715
The important thing is eating
the fruit, not how you get to it.

19:04.051 --> 19:06.052
Eat then.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.429
My name is Cord.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.393
I'm looking for a great
martial artist called Zetan.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.814
There's a bee near your nose.

19:29.036 --> 19:31.037
Who are you?

19:32.039 --> 19:34.457
Last night,
I saw you perform miracles.

19:36.085 --> 19:40.798
If Zetan's skills are
even greater than yours, I-

19:40.882 --> 19:42.800
I'm not ready for him.

19:42.884 --> 19:46.303
With all my training
and both my eyes,

19:46.388 --> 19:49.139
I couldn't survive
one second against you.

19:49.224 --> 19:52.267
My skills are not there
to impress you.

20:03.449 --> 20:05.659
I've got it!

20:05.743 --> 20:07.703
Now I know!

20:07.787 --> 20:10.414
You're Zetan.
I'm the one who's blind!

20:13.043 --> 20:14.127
Are you Zetan?

20:14.211 --> 20:17.214
Whatever you think I am,

20:17.298 --> 20:19.800
or want me to be,

20:19.884 --> 20:22.136
I am.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.056
Be my teacher.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.976
Explain what you do.
I want to practice.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.313
Tie two birds together

20:34.733 --> 20:38.986
and though they have four wings
- they cannot fly.

20:40.655 --> 20:43.908
Well, I'll just follow you
and watch.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.870
And I won't annoy you
by talking.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.122
I can be silent,
believe me.

20:50.169 --> 20:53.588
They say Zetan's
the guardian of a book.

20:53.672 --> 20:55.715
He's had it for many years.

20:55.799 --> 20:59.594
Do you know anything about
this book? Know what it is?

20:59.678 --> 21:02.388
Do you, uh, think
it could be important?

21:04.475 --> 21:07.185
If a man guards a book year after
year, which is more important?

21:07.269 --> 21:09.187
The man or the book?

21:51.820 --> 21:53.612
Is that the secret?

21:53.696 --> 21:55.697
The monkey
tried to circle you-

21:55.782 --> 21:59.243
and you wouldn't let him-
you kept turning.

22:00.703 --> 22:02.913
The way of the monkey
is to play the fool.

22:02.997 --> 22:07.377
While you laugh at his antics,
he bites you from behind.

22:08.420 --> 22:13.926
Unmask his ego, and you expose
a coward disguised as a monkey.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.928
I'll study them.

22:16.012 --> 22:18.305
I'll watch them
very carefully.

22:18.390 --> 22:22.810
You already imitate
their chattering perfectly.

22:22.894 --> 22:24.895
Huh!

22:24.980 --> 22:27.857
I don't have any reason
to fight monkeys.

22:27.941 --> 22:29.900
This lesson has no value.

22:31.361 --> 22:36.365
One is taught in accordance
to one's fitness to learn.

22:39.911 --> 22:42.246
I'll tear my tongue out
and put it-

22:57.433 --> 23:00.352
Morthond! Wait!
It's Cord!

23:24.462 --> 23:27.505
I have brought disgrace
on my brotherhood.

23:27.590 --> 23:29.507
Zetan did this?

23:29.592 --> 23:32.844
Morthond, answer me!
How did this happen?

23:32.929 --> 23:34.930
The first trial.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.015
What was it?

23:37.099 --> 23:40.101
Morthond, what was
the first trial? Where?

23:41.482 --> 23:43.483
Monkey.

23:47.030 --> 23:50.032
Cord. The medallion.

23:50.116 --> 23:52.034
Take it.

24:12.098 --> 24:14.099
How can I help you, Morthond?

24:15.434 --> 24:18.521
Help me die with honor.

27:00.784 --> 27:03.953
The way of the monkey
is to play the fool.

27:04.037 --> 27:07.832
Unmask his ego,
and you expose a coward

27:07.916 --> 27:10.209
disguised as a monkey.

28:13.404 --> 28:14.821
Who are you?

28:14.906 --> 28:16.532
My name is Cord.

28:18.076 --> 28:21.579
Where is your begging bowl?

28:22.706 --> 28:24.043
I'm not here to beg.

28:24.127 --> 28:28.172
You're not here to beg?

28:28.257 --> 28:30.884
I'm here to face the first trial.

28:32.804 --> 28:36.306
Then you will beg.

28:40.061 --> 28:44.856
What school do you come from?

28:44.983 --> 28:46.900
Hmm?
No school.

28:46.985 --> 28:49.736
No school!

28:49.821 --> 28:51.863
I come from myself.

28:51.948 --> 28:56.244
Ah! He comes from himself!

28:56.328 --> 28:59.080
A man with no mother!

29:05.045 --> 29:07.422
What are you looking for,

29:09.174 --> 29:11.634
man with no mother?

29:11.719 --> 29:13.595
What?

29:13.721 --> 29:16.514
I want to find Zetan.

29:19.351 --> 29:23.108
And you think
that to find him

29:23.192 --> 29:27.405
you must fight me, huh?

29:27.489 --> 29:29.991
Yes,

29:31.452 --> 29:37.248
what acknowledged style of fighting
do you use?

29:37.333 --> 29:38.750
My style.

29:49.803 --> 29:55.768
Listen to me,
man who creates himself.

29:55.852 --> 29:59.271
Go back...

29:59.356 --> 30:01.815
the way you came,

30:03.735 --> 30:06.236
in peace.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.782
I don't want to go back.

30:09.866 --> 30:13.661
And I don't want to fight you
unless I have to to find Zetan.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.589
Zetan

30:21.674 --> 30:25.511
is far away

30:25.595 --> 30:28.430
on the other side

30:28.515 --> 30:31.183
of me.

30:31.267 --> 30:33.894
To reach him,

30:33.978 --> 30:37.690
you must first pass through...

30:39.484 --> 30:41.485
me!

30:41.569 --> 30:43.987
What if I just
walk around you?

30:48.118 --> 30:52.871
That is not
in the order of things!

30:54.207 --> 30:56.835
Yes,

30:56.919 --> 31:00.046
if I am your trial,

31:00.131 --> 31:05.009
then I am your trial.

31:06.595 --> 31:10.890
You cannot walk around me.

31:10.975 --> 31:12.892
Then I'll have to fight you.

31:12.977 --> 31:16.150
Yes.

33:31.549 --> 33:34.718
Now tell me the way
to Zetan.

33:34.802 --> 33:37.095
Embrace the west wind

33:37.179 --> 33:41.266
until you come to a wilderness.

33:41.350 --> 33:45.145
Look for a rose there.

33:46.188 --> 33:48.565
Look for a rose?

33:48.649 --> 33:50.567
Is that the second trial?

33:52.153 --> 33:54.988
You asked the way to Zetan.

33:56.198 --> 33:58.199
Are there others ahead of me?

33:59.995 --> 34:03.332
You are the first to pass me.

34:08.757 --> 34:12.719
But other seekers
have other trials.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.603
Am I a beggar
with a begging bowl now?

34:22.688 --> 34:24.940
I put you in my bowl!

35:38.938 --> 35:40.856
Can I help you?

35:40.940 --> 35:42.858
To do what?

35:42.984 --> 35:45.485
To get out of this-
Why?

35:46.571 --> 35:48.947
Who's torturing you this way?

35:49.032 --> 35:51.034
No one.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.329
Isn't that barrel
filled with oil?

35:55.414 --> 35:59.670
Of course.
I filled it myself.

35:59.796 --> 36:03.508
You? I filled it myself,
and I got in it myself.

36:03.593 --> 36:05.761
I've been in here ten years.

36:05.845 --> 36:07.471
But why?

36:11.642 --> 36:14.853
To rid myself
of the bottom half of me.

36:16.856 --> 36:19.608
There's very little left of it now.

36:24.155 --> 36:26.114
Your legs look like seaweed.

36:26.199 --> 36:28.200
I hope so.

36:29.327 --> 36:33.915
That thing- that terrible
thing between my legs-

36:33.999 --> 36:36.084
it's almost gone no,
isn't it?

36:40.380 --> 36:43.758
A mere pimple.
Good.

36:43.842 --> 36:47.012
It'll go altogether soon,
I hope.

36:51.351 --> 36:53.352
Ten years!

36:54.690 --> 36:56.650
How do you live
without eating?

36:56.734 --> 36:59.361
My family. They bring me

36:59.445 --> 37:01.488
a little rice, a little water.

37:02.490 --> 37:04.450
Your family?

37:04.535 --> 37:07.537
They know you’re dissolving
yourself in oil?

37:07.621 --> 37:10.665
They weren't too happy
about it at first.

37:10.749 --> 37:12.750
Especially my wife.

37:14.878 --> 37:17.004
Now she understands.

37:19.007 --> 37:21.050
But why would you want to-

37:22.177 --> 37:24.137
Ah.

37:24.221 --> 37:27.223
You could have taken
a vow of chastity, like I have.

37:27.307 --> 37:31.144
I took a vow of chastity. I took ten vows
- a hundred.

37:32.938 --> 37:35.232
How can a man be
a holy man

37:35.316 --> 37:38.610
when that terrible thing
attaches him to the earth?

37:39.696 --> 37:41.739
I got rid of my money,
I shed my clothes,

37:41.824 --> 37:44.492
I ate a spoonful of rice
each day,

37:44.577 --> 37:47.453
and my mind began to soar.

37:47.538 --> 37:50.206
I felt the universe.

37:50.291 --> 37:53.421
I was the universe.

37:54.756 --> 37:58.968
And then, that terrible thing
summoned me.

37:59.052 --> 38:01.846
"Hello!" it cried.

38:01.930 --> 38:04.933
"Think of the pleasure!"

38:06.394 --> 38:08.312
Several times,
I grabbed a knife.

38:08.396 --> 38:11.648
I intended to rid myself of it
once and for all.

38:14.569 --> 38:17.779
But I-
I was a coward.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.829
Then... I found a way!

38:28.124 --> 38:30.876
I would dissolve it away

38:30.960 --> 38:33.670
and the legs
that carried it along.

38:35.132 --> 38:37.551
Oh, you are obviously
mentally disturbed.

38:37.677 --> 38:40.095
Mm-hmm. You should have seen a doctor.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.139
I am a doctor.

38:49.192 --> 38:51.193
You took a vow of chastity.

38:51.277 --> 38:53.195
Yes.

38:53.279 --> 38:55.280
You won't keep it.

38:56.699 --> 38:58.617
Come in here with me.

38:58.701 --> 39:03.413
There's plenty of room.
We'll keep each other company.

39:03.498 --> 39:06.209
I'm sorry, but I must go.
I'm looking for someone.

39:06.335 --> 39:08.378
Who?
Zetan.

39:09.505 --> 39:11.589
Again Zetan!

39:11.674 --> 39:14.425
They all come around
asking about Zetan!

39:14.551 --> 39:17.845
There is no answer
in Zetan.

39:17.930 --> 39:21.015
The answer is
in here with me.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.685
If you won't melt it off,
cut it off!

39:23.769 --> 39:28.314
Do it now! For whatever your
dreams are, it will ruin them!

39:29.358 --> 39:33.028
It's like a sword,
that terrible thing!

39:33.113 --> 39:37.033
It will-
It will cut you to pieces!

43:17.444 --> 43:20.238
Have you eaten?

43:20.322 --> 43:23.032
Where’s your drink?
Your hand is empty.

43:23.116 --> 43:25.451
Peace.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.537
Don't wish it on me!

43:27.621 --> 43:30.915
The whole world is in commotion,
and you wish me peace!

43:30.999 --> 43:34.004
I don't know what peace
is. I don't want it.

43:34.089 --> 43:37.341
Don't you listen to the desert?

43:37.425 --> 43:41.011
Even when there's no windy
the sand sings.

43:41.097 --> 43:43.723
My name is Cord.

43:43.808 --> 43:46.560
Hah! You see? Cord!

43:48.980 --> 43:51.690
Play a chord!
Strike a chord!

43:51.774 --> 43:53.733
Even your name is a noise!

43:53.818 --> 43:56.444
What do you want, Cord?

43:56.529 --> 43:59.030
You want us to play on you?

43:59.115 --> 44:03.493
My wives can make
your skin sing.

44:04.495 --> 44:05.912
Who are you?

44:05.997 --> 44:07.999
Changsha.

44:09.167 --> 44:13.880
It is my wish to provide
everything that is needed.

44:13.965 --> 44:16.258
Tell me what you need, Cord,

44:16.342 --> 44:19.720
that I may find happiness
in providing it for you.

44:22.724 --> 44:27.185
I seek a rose... in the wilderness.

44:28.649 --> 44:30.650
Her name is Tara.

44:32.528 --> 44:34.904
My ninth wife.

44:34.989 --> 44:38.116
You may have her.

44:38.200 --> 44:40.160
But I've taken a vow of chastity.

44:40.244 --> 44:45.499
Hah, hah! Well, taking her
will be a twin sacrifice.

44:45.584 --> 44:47.960
Her of her vows to me,

44:48.045 --> 44:50.588
and you of your vows
to yourself.

44:52.007 --> 44:54.800
My second trial.
Is it with you?

44:55.927 --> 44:58.346
Perhaps.

44:58.430 --> 45:00.389
Who knows?

45:01.893 --> 45:04.353
Do you know?

45:04.437 --> 45:06.188
Huh?

46:14.639 --> 46:17.057
Is it still your needy
my friend,

46:17.142 --> 46:19.226
to test yourself against me?

46:19.310 --> 46:21.103
It is my need.

46:21.190 --> 46:25.402
Then put out your handy
my black brother,

46:25.486 --> 46:28.196
for what you feel will satisfy you.

48:34.460 --> 48:37.462
You came to me
to test yourself,

48:39.382 --> 48:43.636
and in losing,
you have gained your victory.

48:43.721 --> 48:47.015
For now, you are
on the threshold of truth.

48:48.101 --> 48:50.102
That knowledge-

48:51.187 --> 48:56.317
that gift, which is what
you really want from me-

49:00.071 --> 49:02.072
you have it now.

49:10.957 --> 49:12.961
When do we fight?

49:14.839 --> 49:17.674
After we sleep, my boy.

50:37.888 --> 50:39.931
It pleases you?

50:44.186 --> 50:47.731
- Where is your-
- No harm will come to you.

50:47.815 --> 50:49.983
My husband sent me to you.

50:51.695 --> 50:53.696
Is he Zetan?

50:54.865 --> 50:56.866
He is Changsha.

50:56.950 --> 50:59.243
Not the keeper of the book?

50:59.327 --> 51:01.746
What book?

51:01.830 --> 51:04.707
Why did he send you?

51:04.794 --> 51:07.629
This will not violate your vow.

51:09.424 --> 51:13.218
The desired fruit may be enjoyed
without consuming it.

51:21.228 --> 51:23.730
I've been traveling
for a long time.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.693
Rest.

51:31.281 --> 51:35.576
I've been taking a journey that was
indicated in the palm of my hand.

51:58.518 --> 52:00.477
You're my trial, aren't you?

52:04.360 --> 52:08.446
Let me walk the line in your
palm with you for a moment.

52:09.532 --> 52:12.283
No.

52:31.055 --> 52:33.640
Let me show you.

54:36.818 --> 54:39.945
You asked to walk the line
of my palm with me.

54:40.029 --> 54:42.030
You refused me!

54:42.115 --> 54:44.616
Do you invite me now?

54:50.581 --> 54:54.045
Walk with me,
but not for just a moment.

54:54.130 --> 54:56.841
Forever.

55:13.151 --> 55:15.152
Cord.

55:15.236 --> 55:17.237
I'll go with you,

55:18.239 --> 55:20.240
but first we must rest.

55:21.326 --> 55:24.411
What lies ahead of us
will not be easy.

55:57.700 --> 55:59.701
Tara?

56:04.291 --> 56:14.258
Tara!

56:32.695 --> 56:34.655
No!

56:54.095 --> 57:00.477
Changsha!

57:08.653 --> 57:13.866
Changsha!

58:06.258 --> 58:10.261
Cord! I am here.

59:06.241 --> 59:10.411
Cord! I am here.

59:27.345 --> 59:29.179
Zetan?

59:33.686 --> 59:38.192
Stronger than Zetan.

59:41.071 --> 59:44.700
Death. I know you.

59:56.755 --> 59:59.590
Why are you so ugly?

01:00:01.176 --> 01:00:04.095
Or do you have a different face
for every man?

01:00:10.686 --> 01:00:12.479
Shall I go to my knees?

01:00:15.358 --> 01:00:19.152
Are you waiting for fear to freeze
my heart before you carve it out?

01:00:19.236 --> 01:00:23.573
Soon, Cord! Soon!

01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:29.621
Come anytime,
welcome guest.

01:01:56.094 --> 01:01:58.095
It can't be done.

01:02:02.976 --> 01:02:05.353
You can't do it.

01:02:09.734 --> 01:02:11.151
Can't do what?

01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:14.529
You can't step twice
on the same piece of water.

01:02:40.686 --> 01:02:43.271
A fish saved my life once.

01:02:43.397 --> 01:02:46.024
How?
I ate him.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.825
How long have
you been blind?

01:02:54.909 --> 01:02:57.202
How long have you
been blind?

01:02:57.328 --> 01:03:00.080
I'm not blind.
Am I?

01:03:00.164 --> 01:03:02.332
Do you answer
every question with a question?

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:04.835
Do you question every answer?

01:03:04.919 --> 01:03:07.004
Talking to you is like
talking to a wall.

01:03:07.089 --> 01:03:09.340
Buddha once sat
before a wall,

01:03:09.424 --> 01:03:12.009
and when he arose,
he was enlightened.

01:03:12.094 --> 01:03:14.178
Do you compare yourself
with Buddha?

01:03:14.263 --> 01:03:16.889
Hah, hah, no;
only to the wall.

01:03:32.785 --> 01:03:35.662
You have not told me
of your second trial.

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:40.418
It wasn't a trial.

01:03:40.502 --> 01:03:42.461
It was a lesson.

01:03:44.464 --> 01:03:46.382
Teach it to me.

01:03:46.466 --> 01:03:50.011
Ah, you know it.

01:03:50.095 --> 01:03:53.055
You seem to know
everything.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.017
Each morning
when I awake,

01:03:56.101 --> 01:03:58.185
like a scholar
at his first classy

01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:03.065
I prepare a blank mind
for the day to write upon.

01:04:05.652 --> 01:04:08.322
A year ago
I took a vow of chastity.

01:04:09.949 --> 01:04:11.950
A day ago I broke it.

01:04:13.745 --> 01:04:16.371
Gladly, because

01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:18.541
I realized we are born to love.

01:04:20.631 --> 01:04:25.176
But what I did then was worse
than taking any foolish vow.

01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:29.513
I tried to possess
what I loved.

01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:35.102
I didn't know then that

01:04:35.187 --> 01:04:38.357
the embrace of love
held too tightly

01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:44.321
can destroy the one you love.

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:50.118
Cord.

01:04:51.371 --> 01:04:54.998
Each moment that passes
changes you.

01:04:55.083 --> 01:04:59.920
You do not-
cannot possess even yourself.

01:05:00.922 --> 01:05:05.717
How can you hope to possess
anyone or anything else?

01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:33.166
I realize now you are
my hidden teacher.

01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:37.045
And if I am to survive the next trial, I
must be allowed to follow you and to learn.

01:05:37.171 --> 01:05:40.008
You will never endure it.
I will.

01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:42.010
Will I?

01:05:42.094 --> 01:05:45.513
Hah, hah, tell me why
I won't be able to endure it.

01:05:45.597 --> 01:05:48.641
You will never have the patience.
You will see things and judge them

01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:51.310
before you know what
they mean. What things?

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:56.357
You see? You ask what things even
before the things have happened.

01:05:56.442 --> 01:05:58.526
Your impatience is beyond me.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.195
I'll be patient.
I'll be an empty vessel!

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.156
One condition.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.323
Anything.

01:06:04.408 --> 01:06:07.745
You must ask nothing
about any event

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:11.583
until such time as
I myself give you an answer.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:12.962
Agreed.

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:20.553
We wish to cross your river.

01:06:20.637 --> 01:06:23.347
What is the fare
for the two of us?

01:06:23.432 --> 01:06:25.850
You don't look
as if you have money.

01:06:25.934 --> 01:06:29.854
Ah! Ah!
Will this be payment enough?

01:06:30.939 --> 01:06:32.940
Aha.

01:06:33.025 --> 01:06:35.151
Yes, yes, this will do.

01:06:35.235 --> 01:06:39.113
Wait, you old fool!
Let me see.

01:06:39.198 --> 01:06:42.743
It's worthless.
If you want to cross the river, swim.

01:06:42.827 --> 01:06:46.413
Stop that! This is an honest man.

01:06:46.498 --> 01:06:51.418
Like you are a good man in bed,
you silly stick!

01:06:51.503 --> 01:06:53.796
No money,
no transportation.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.466
It is my boat!
I will decide.

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.761
Your boat?
Your poor son’s and mine.

01:07:00.845 --> 01:07:03.056
Since when is it yours?

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.725
Since I married you,
you ignoramus!

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:08.061
Didn't I pay for it
with the gift of my body...

01:07:08.145 --> 01:07:10.942
and the blessing of a boy child?

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:14.321
Hah! The gift you gave me once

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:17.199
twenty years ago!

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:21.120
How do you expect to get the boat back,
you idiot? You never think of nothing.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.205
That poor man.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.542
He's happy.
Happy?

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.253
There's misery in every bone
in his body.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:34.133
Is not a happy man
one who does not fear death?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.135
Not only does he not fear it,

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:40.139
his days are filled with joy
looking forward to it.

01:07:45.563 --> 01:07:47.522
Why'd you do that?

01:07:58.577 --> 01:08:02.788
He wanted to help us.
Is that how you repay him?

01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:04.456
You’ve destroyed
his livelihood.

01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.796
He'll be defenseless
against her now.

01:08:07.881 --> 01:08:13.428
I told you you would
jump to conclusions.

01:08:17.224 --> 01:08:20.018
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.

01:08:20.102 --> 01:08:22.854
There's nothing here
to hide from.

01:08:22.938 --> 01:08:25.023
Not yet.

01:08:30.154 --> 01:08:32.529
Ah! They've seen you.

01:08:35.075 --> 01:08:37.076
I never thought
you'd run from a fight.

01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:40.371
It's hard to kill a horse
with a flute.

01:11:48.622 --> 01:11:51.499
Why do you have to pick now
to do good deeds?

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:54.547
You're feeling guilty because
you kicked in the ferryman's boat,

01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:56.590
so you're committing suicide.

01:11:56.675 --> 01:11:58.884
You're not only a fool,
you can't keep a promise.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:03.097
What promise? You said you
would tear out your tongue-

01:12:59.327 --> 01:13:01.661
The chimney's broken too.
We could fix that.

01:13:01.746 --> 01:13:03.747
And the roof needs mending.

01:13:58.016 --> 01:14:00.142
I'm thinking
of saying good-bye.

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.228
Good-bye.

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:05.314
I was crazy to believe
you were my teacher.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:08.401
Learn to listen

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:10.570
to that which is not spoken.

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:12.780
I'm tired of your riddles.

01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:14.949
There was no lesson in
what just happened.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:17.910
All I saw was a fool inviting
his assassins to kill him.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:20.914
The fool is the twin
of the wise.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:23.376
Ah.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.629
And you can't step on
the same piece of water twice,

01:14:26.714 --> 01:14:29.591
and two birds tied together
have four wings but cannot fly,

01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:31.926
and- and- and the tadpole
loses its strength,

01:14:32.011 --> 01:14:34.095
and the sword
can't cut itself.

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:37.265
The path and the gateway
have no use or meaning

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:40.268
once the objective is in sight.

01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:43.482
And a horse has no udders,
and a cow can't whinny,

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:47.945
and up is down,
and sideways is straight ahead.

01:14:56.289 --> 01:14:58.540
Oh, look. Look.

01:14:58.666 --> 01:15:01.043
Who are they?
Ow!

01:15:08.718 --> 01:15:11.386
Mister, please.
Do you have a coin?

01:15:11.471 --> 01:15:14.848
Coin! Coin! Please.

01:16:21.423 --> 01:16:22.840
Why?

01:16:26.262 --> 01:16:28.430
This time I'm leaving.

01:16:28.514 --> 01:16:31.224
You must stop
making promises.

01:16:31.308 --> 01:16:33.893
This is more than a promise.

01:16:33.978 --> 01:16:37.483
Now that I'm free of you,
I'm free to ask questions.

01:16:37.568 --> 01:16:39.485
Explain yourself.

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:42.739
What did you mean by
kicking in the ferryboat?

01:16:42.823 --> 01:16:46.576
Of the two of us,
you are the one who is blind.

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.578
Blinded by what you see.

01:16:48.662 --> 01:16:51.706
I want an answer,
not all this philosophy.

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:54.543
I damaged the boat
because if I hadn't,

01:16:54.627 --> 01:16:57.254
the soldiers would have used it
to cross the river,

01:16:57.338 --> 01:17:01.091
and the old man and all his
family would have been killed.

01:17:01.176 --> 01:17:03.927
Achieving his happiness,
perhaps.

01:17:04.012 --> 01:17:06.472
But how did you know
the soldiers were coming?

01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:09.434
- Did you hear them?
- No.

01:17:09.518 --> 01:17:13.396
The stone wall.
Why did you stop to repair it?

01:17:13.481 --> 01:17:17.484
There was a bag of coins
partly exposed in the stones.

01:17:17.568 --> 01:17:21.446
I repaired the wall so the soldiers
wouldn't find it and steal it,

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.450
leaving the widow and her
children without means.

01:17:24.534 --> 01:17:28.120
You couldn't see the bag.
Did you smell it?

01:17:28.205 --> 01:17:30.623
No.

01:17:30.707 --> 01:17:33.086
The boy. Explain the boy.

01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:35.130
The boy.

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:38.967
You mutilated the boy. You
broke his nose, a beautiful boy.

01:17:39.052 --> 01:17:41.261
Too beautiful.

01:17:41.346 --> 01:17:45.140
He was a tyrant. He would
have grown up to be worse.

01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:49.478
I freed his parents from
their bondage to his beauty.

01:17:49.562 --> 01:17:51.438
Hah! You didn't even
touch his face.

01:17:51.523 --> 01:17:54.608
How'd you know what he
looked like? Did you sense it?

01:17:54.692 --> 01:17:58.738
No. But I freed his parents
and the boy too,

01:17:58.823 --> 01:18:00.740
and now,

01:18:00.825 --> 01:18:04.161
I free you of me.

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.497
Well, I haven't finished yet.

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:10.125
You didn't hear the soldiers,
and you didn't smell the bag,

01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:12.503
and you didn't sense the boy.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.505
I want an explanation.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.507
I knew.

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.884
How?

01:18:26.227 --> 01:18:28.603
You were through here before!

01:18:31.652 --> 01:18:34.028
How many times?

01:19:19.827 --> 01:19:22.162
What is this?

01:19:23.289 --> 01:19:25.248
Cord?

01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:31.091
Hah, hah, yes, Cord!

01:19:31.176 --> 01:19:35.930
The man I entertained
in the wilderness.

01:19:36.014 --> 01:19:40.017
The very same Cord, yes.

01:19:42.354 --> 01:19:45.105
No,

01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:47.149
not the same.

01:19:48.485 --> 01:19:50.194
Not quite.

01:19:51.655 --> 01:19:54.741
But you’re still
looking for the same-

01:19:54.825 --> 01:19:56.451
Zetan.

01:19:56.535 --> 01:19:59.455
Hah! Yes.

01:20:00.874 --> 01:20:02.875
Zetan.

01:20:07.547 --> 01:20:09.507
He's very near.

01:20:09.591 --> 01:20:13.844
Oh. Very, very near.

01:20:13.929 --> 01:20:17.223
All you have to do
is pass by me.

01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:21.644
I have no quarrel with you.

01:20:21.728 --> 01:20:24.483
No quarrel?

01:20:24.567 --> 01:20:28.697
Hah, hah,
but what of your love,

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.700
Tara?

01:20:32.743 --> 01:20:35.662
Did I not crucify Tara?

01:20:35.746 --> 01:20:37.622
No.

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:41.835
But I myself,
with these two hands-

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.838
No,

01:20:44.922 --> 01:20:48.968
I myself, with these two hands.

01:20:49.052 --> 01:20:51.429
Not the same Cord.

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:56.017
So,

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.352
you do not
confront me with hate.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.313
No.

01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:02.524
Then why confront me at all?

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.609
Join me.

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:06.695
Take my hand.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:12.701
Ah, I can show you a world where
you will find no night or day.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:16.329
The sun will never
rise or set.

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:18.331
My goal is Zetan.

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.420
Ah, yes.

01:21:23.549 --> 01:21:26.342
At daybreak then.

01:21:26.427 --> 01:21:28.386
Along the beach.

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:31.015
No.

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:33.017
Now.

01:23:47.999 --> 01:23:49.082
Huh?

01:24:11.026 --> 01:24:13.027
Huh?

01:25:34.158 --> 01:25:36.785
Not the same Cord.

01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:44.668
Your way lies
across the water.

01:25:50.592 --> 01:25:52.718
You are the chosen.

01:26:44.068 --> 01:26:46.569
You have sought Zetan.

01:26:46.654 --> 01:26:48.822
Zetan is here.

01:27:03.382 --> 01:27:06.050
My dear Cord.

01:27:06.135 --> 01:27:08.762
I am so pleased to see you.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:29.993
Extraordinary what the soil
here does for the perfume.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.211
Please.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.305
Who are they?

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:52.057
They are the Near Ones.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:55.561
They are studying
the perfecting of perfection.

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.608
Are you their teacher?

01:27:57.692 --> 01:27:59.067
No, not really.

01:27:59.152 --> 01:28:01.236
We have found
that the best way is

01:28:01.321 --> 01:28:03.489
for the teacher, so called,
and the student

01:28:03.573 --> 01:28:06.325
to produce the teaching
together.

01:28:06.409 --> 01:28:08.536
What do you think?

01:28:08.621 --> 01:28:11.665
Yes, it sounds reasonable.

01:28:27.766 --> 01:28:30.017
Is something disturbing you, Cord?

01:28:36.775 --> 01:28:39.152
No.

01:28:39.237 --> 01:28:41.780
You seem somewhat puzzled.

01:28:44.784 --> 01:28:46.743
I want to know
when we fight.

01:28:46.827 --> 01:28:49.037
Who?

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.712
You and I.

01:28:54.797 --> 01:28:57.257
About what?

01:28:57.341 --> 01:29:01.052
The book.

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:03.346
The everlasting book.

01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:06.892
Very well.

01:29:06.977 --> 01:29:11.022
We will go to the terrace and
rehearse you in the ceremony.

01:29:11.107 --> 01:29:13.108
What ceremony?

01:29:15.319 --> 01:29:19.072
The one that precedes your being
made the keeper of the book.

01:29:19.156 --> 01:29:22.033
Wait! Wait!
I don't understand.

01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.375
This is the seat of harmony, Cord.

01:30:08.794 --> 01:30:11.881
There seems to me to be nothing
but harmony on this island.

01:30:11.965 --> 01:30:15.968
Yes, it, uh, permeates
everything here.

01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:20.514
Try the seat, Cord.
Go on, try it.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:35.780
Can you see your future, Cord?

01:30:37.032 --> 01:30:39.241
Endless days of peace.

01:30:41.454 --> 01:30:45.207
Is there any man
who can wish for more?

01:30:48.631 --> 01:30:51.007
The book,

01:30:51.092 --> 01:30:53.051
please.

01:30:57.808 --> 01:30:59.809
The book.

01:31:07.818 --> 01:31:11.028
You have survived
several trials, I am sure.

01:31:11.113 --> 01:31:13.031
Very frightening
they must have been,

01:31:13.116 --> 01:31:15.909
but what you are
about to see now

01:31:15.993 --> 01:31:19.746
may be even more alarming.

01:31:21.332 --> 01:31:23.750
You can take my place here, Cord,

01:31:23.835 --> 01:31:29.131
without looking into the book,
just as I did many years ago.

01:31:31.342 --> 01:31:33.343
I must look first.

01:32:14.475 --> 01:32:19.395
The seekers fight their way here,
year after year,

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.773
willing, eager to pay
a terrible price

01:32:21.857 --> 01:32:23.775
to see what is in that book.

01:32:23.859 --> 01:32:26.068
And when they fling it open
in blazing expectation

01:32:26.153 --> 01:32:29.614
of finding all the answers
to all life's questions,

01:32:29.698 --> 01:32:31.741
what do they find?

01:32:31.825 --> 01:32:35.912
Themselves.

01:32:37.414 --> 01:32:40.544
There is no book, Cord.

01:32:41.588 --> 01:32:44.175
No enlightenment

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:46.594
outside yourself.

01:32:46.678 --> 01:32:49.347
There is nothing
to take back?

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.307
No.

01:32:52.392 --> 01:32:54.977
They are here, most of them.

01:32:55.062 --> 01:32:58.648
Others have gone back
into the world,

01:32:58.732 --> 01:33:00.650
and in all manner of disguises,

01:33:00.734 --> 01:33:04.195
they have provided the trials
such as you have experienced.

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.407
Some become teachers.

01:33:10.828 --> 01:33:13.538
And one of them
plays a flute

01:33:15.333 --> 01:33:17.334
that only I can hear!

01:33:20.421 --> 01:33:23.507
I was your age when
I was sent to find the book,

01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:25.551
and I became the keeper.

01:33:25.635 --> 01:33:28.387
Now you, Cord-
you can be the keeper.

01:33:28.471 --> 01:33:30.722
You will enjoy it-

01:33:30.807 --> 01:33:33.350
the endless peace and pleasure!

01:33:33.434 --> 01:33:35.435
Release me, Cord!

01:33:37.733 --> 01:33:39.777
Release me.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:09.182
You've looked at the book, Cord.

01:34:10.894 --> 01:34:12.895
Yes.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.276
And what did you see?

01:34:19.862 --> 01:34:21.863
Everything.
