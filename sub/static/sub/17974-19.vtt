warm and don't get scared

your feety pajamas

00:41.008 --> 00:42.875
and Ray Lewis plush doll.

00:42.877 --> 00:46.078
First of all, it's not a doll,
it's an action pillow.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.846
And second, stop babying me.

09:50.923 --> 09:51.957
Thanks again, Padre,

09:51.959 --> 09:54.292
for forgiving me
for pushing the fat kid,

09:54.294 --> 09:56.761
<i>and</i> for keeping your
hands to yourself.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.563
Tell Jesus
I'll hit him up later.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.231
That's a nice
suit, Rallo.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.300
Thanks.
I got it on eBay.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.869
Peter Dinklage wore it
to the Golden Globes.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.404
Y'all go to church?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.939
Yeah. Church's Chicken.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.975
Now <i>you</i> coming with us.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.446
Here you go.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.314
It does everything
your other stuff already does.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.017
I am gonna be so smug
about owning this.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.621
Okay. What was
that all about?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.989
Check your pocket.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.156
An iPhone?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.826
You put this in my pocket?
You stole it!

10:27.828 --> 10:29.961
Looks to me
like <i>you</i> stole it.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.062
But I'll take it.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.664
Hey! You kids, stop!

10:32.666 --> 10:34.165
Run!

10:34.167 --> 10:35.567
Be careful with that!

10:35.569 --> 10:37.335
It has a soul!

10:37.337 --> 10:38.670
Throw me the phone!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.238
What, this phone?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.008
Bad move, Rallo.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.542
You gonna pay for that.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.347
Oh, my God, no!

10:49.349 --> 10:50.849
SIRI:
What is happening?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.851
I can't feel my legs.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.619
I'm so... cold.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.854
Shh, shh, shh.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.323
It'll be okay.
(sobbing)

11:03.262 --> 11:04.829
(both grunt)

11:05.765 --> 11:07.532
Dad! Help me!

11:07.534 --> 11:11.603
I'm being chased by two ruffians
and a ne'er-do-well!

11:11.605 --> 11:13.138
'Sup, Montclair?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.606
How's your weekend?

11:14.608 --> 11:16.107
Good, good.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.043
So, uh,
c-can you take me home now?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.344
Like, right now?

11:19.346 --> 11:22.280
Yeah, my weekend was good, too.
Thanks.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.050
Manners matter, Rallo.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.690
(sighs)
All right, I'm sorry.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.191
How was Baltimore?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
I don't want to
tell you now.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.698
Is that a new suit?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.700
Mm-hmm. Got it on eBay.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.736
Tilda Swinton wore it
to the Golden Globes.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.738
Cleveland, the librarian
at school told me

11:46.740 --> 11:48.873
that you were at her mother's
funeral yesterday.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.809
Delores was
your friend's mother?!

11:50.811 --> 11:52.310
Oh, wonderful woman.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.713
Apparently, she had an affair
with Pat Nixon

11:54.715 --> 11:57.182
but had the decency
to keep it to herself.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.883
A real class act.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.085
What the hell is going on?

12:00.087 --> 12:01.920
Holt bought us
burial plots,

12:01.922 --> 12:04.823
so we've been spending
a lot of time at the cemetery.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.325
Then some guy paid us
to go to a funeral,

12:07.327 --> 12:09.027
so we started
doing that.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.829
That is horrible!
Don't worry.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.597
Holt got you a plot, too.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.999
I put you on the end,
because that one time

12:15.001 --> 12:18.069
you were on a plane you said
you liked the aisle seat.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.905
Cleveland, getting paid to go
to strangers' funerals

12:20.907 --> 12:22.741
is gross and wrong.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.276
I agree, which is why I stopped
taking the money.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.846
I just do it now
because I enjoy it.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.281
Oh, I should go.
I'm eulogizing someone.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.283
Who?
I don't know.
Some dude.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.853
Cleveland, death is not
something to be taken lightly.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.921
It should be feared and
avoided, like a pit bull

12:36.923 --> 12:38.423
or getting
your hair wet.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.858
You know what?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.926
I'm cashing in my
"forbid" coupon.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.463
"This coupon allows Donna
to forbid Cleveland

12:45.465 --> 12:47.732
from doing
one stupid thing."

12:47.734 --> 12:51.636
You know, for a birthday present
you called "cheap and lazy,"

12:51.638 --> 12:54.139
you're pretty happy
to have them now.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.707
(door opens)

12:55.709 --> 12:58.109
(chuckles)
Got next year's gift.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.247
So let me get this straight.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.048
You beat up three punk kids

13:04.050 --> 13:06.050
and gave that fat kid
his ball back?

13:06.052 --> 13:07.152
That's right.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.753
You are the
man, Rallo.

13:08.755 --> 13:09.754
I know.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.656
I made East Stoolbend my bitch.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.625
Yay! Jiffy Pop!

13:13.627 --> 13:15.059
This burned.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.461
I don't know why.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.029
(knocking)

13:19.431 --> 13:20.965
Nice place, Rallo.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.066
You miss us?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.268
What are you
doing here?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.003
Mama!

13:25.005 --> 13:27.238
Before you tell her
whatever you're gonna tell her,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.408
maybe you should take a look
at these pictures.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.082
Who is it, baby?
Are the Mormons back?

13:38.084 --> 13:39.350
Who are these
scruffy kids?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.186
These are, um...

13:41.188 --> 13:43.855
They're some kids I met
at Dad's this weekend.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.290
Hello, I'm Tyler.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.025
You must be Rallo's sister.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.026
(giggles)

13:48.028 --> 13:49.928
Oh, I like you.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.196
Y'all come in.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.931
I just made Jiffy Pop.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.232
(gulps)

13:59.171 --> 14:01.806
I can't believe
you guys are in my house.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.043
Well, you left before we were
done playing with you.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.112
Yeah, we're part of
your life now, Rallo.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.514
That is so sweet.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.382
I should get
my camera.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.018
Rallo, why don't you take your
new friends up to your room

14:14.020 --> 14:15.320
and show them your Xbox

14:15.322 --> 14:17.155
or PS3 or Wii or Leap Pad...
Don't! Mom!

14:17.157 --> 14:18.723
Stop telling them what I got!

14:18.725 --> 14:21.192
...and I'll go make some
Rice Krispie Treats.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.628
You owe us
for that iPhone, Rallo,

14:23.630 --> 14:27.232
and we're not leaving
till we get what's ours.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.800
Who are these
scruffy kids?

14:28.802 --> 14:30.134
(sniffs)

14:30.136 --> 14:32.337
You guys smell
like the outside.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.972
What do you want, Cleveland?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.974
I wanted to bring you this.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.076
Your Garbage Pail Kids cards?

14:38.078 --> 14:41.145
Priceless
Garbage Pail Kids cards, yes,

14:41.147 --> 14:43.314
for your big
show-and-tell tomorrow.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.983
Huh, show-and-tell.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.018
That sounds profitable.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.586
I don't think I should.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.587
Poppycock!

14:49.589 --> 14:51.189
Go on, take them.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.191
Now that I've seen my
final resting place,

14:53.193 --> 14:54.826
I can't wait to die.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.028
And these will
be my legacy.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.529
I share them with you.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.399
Huh, fat guys <i>are</i> good
at sharing.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.867
Thanks, Cleveland.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.202
That's Creepy
Cleveland.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.403
(laughs)

15:05.405 --> 15:07.105
Garbage Pail Kid name.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.908
That's how you're gonna
pay us back, Rallo.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.943
You're gonna help us
jack show-and-tell.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.344
No way.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.114
I'm not gonna help you steal
from my friends.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.250
Then maybe we'll e-mail
those pictures to your mom.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.419
All right, I'll do it.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.355
But this is my last job,
and I'm out of the game.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.723
You hear me?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.258
I got a family now!

15:27.260 --> 15:29.227
They're counting on me!

15:29.229 --> 15:30.762
These melted.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.963
I don't know why.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.365
(school bell ringing)

15:34.367 --> 15:37.535
Show-and-tell
will be extra special today

15:37.537 --> 15:40.371
because Rallo brought
special guests.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.240
Apartment kids.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.175
KIDS:
Ooh!

15:46.111 --> 15:47.712
I'm telling you,
there's no way

15:47.714 --> 15:49.714
you're gonna be able
to jack show-and-tell.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.950
Mrs. Lowenstein makes us
put all the items

15:51.952 --> 15:55.286
in a brown paper grocery bag
that she keeps under her desk.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.121
It's like Fort Knox.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.256
You leave that to us.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.591
Your job is to cause
a distraction.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.328
During recess,
you're gonna play hide-and-seek.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.163
Make sure you're it.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.631
When everyone hides,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.399
you act like
you can't find them,

16:08.401 --> 16:11.269
then we'll sneak in
and take the bag.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.670
That's not gonna work.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.172
I'm the hide-and-seek champ.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.440
If I don't
find them immediately,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.175
they're gonna know
something's up.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.843
Don't screw this up, Rallo.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.144
Okay, I'll do it.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.413
(groans)

16:27.619 --> 16:29.253
Okay, everyone.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.089
After our 40-minute nap,

16:31.091 --> 16:33.091
where I secretly lay down
with you

16:33.093 --> 16:35.259
and pretend you are
my own children,

16:35.261 --> 16:38.329
we'll have recess
and then show-and-tell.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.664
(school bell ringing)

16:39.666 --> 16:41.933
(cheering)

16:45.270 --> 16:48.139
It's go time.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.174
Who wants to play
hide-and-seek?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.509
I'll be it.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.277
One,

16:53.279 --> 16:55.880
two, three...

17:07.393 --> 17:10.161
You guys are hiding so good.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.964
I don't know
that I'll ever find you.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.206
Donna, I've said good-bye
to Brownternity,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.142
my burial plot.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.711
I just came up
with that name now.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.379
I wish I'd thought
of it earlier.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.815
And to apologize
for my behavior,

17:30.817 --> 17:33.985
I'd like to take you out
for a romantic dinner.

17:33.987 --> 17:37.021
Sweet! I'm gonna go put
on my good eating shirt.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.923
Hey, Junior.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.858
I haven't seen you much
this episode.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.261
Yeah, I got a bye week.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.596
(kids crying)

17:47.032 --> 17:49.200
Man, they took
my grandfather's watch.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.936
They took
my grandfather's ashes.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.371
This is
your fault, Rallo.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.440
You brought those kids here.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.442
Okay, everybody,
just relax.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.177
You're right.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.412
I knew they were gonna do this,
and I'm sorry.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.281
But come on,

18:03.283 --> 18:06.250
did you really think I would
let them get away with it?

18:06.252 --> 18:09.387
Not only am I the best seeker...

18:09.389 --> 18:10.254
(kids gasp)

18:10.256 --> 18:13.758
...I'm also the best hider!

18:13.760 --> 18:16.360
(cheering)

18:16.362 --> 18:18.463
How'd you do it, Rallo?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.998
During nap time,
I switched the bag.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.437
<i>It was surprisingly easy.</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:28.372
Now, how's about
we have us

18:28.374 --> 18:30.708
a good old-fashioned
show-and-tell!

18:30.710 --> 18:32.310
(cheering)

18:32.312 --> 18:34.479
Not so fast.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.948
You think you can just
trick us like that?

18:36.950 --> 18:38.716
We want that stuff.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.385
No.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.387
I'm tired of you guys
bullying me.

18:43.389 --> 18:46.157
This is ours,
and you can't have it!

18:46.159 --> 18:47.425
Yeah!

18:47.427 --> 18:48.960
Get out of here,
you poor kids.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.761
That's right!
Wait, what?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.797
We don't want trash
like you around here.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.434
I bet you drink tap
water, like a dog.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.969
Whoa, Hot Wheels!

18:57.971 --> 18:59.403
All of you!

18:59.405 --> 19:01.239
These are
human beings.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.773
What's wrong with you?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.476
We hate them because they're
bullies and thieves,

19:05.478 --> 19:08.112
not because they're poor
and underprivileged.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.248
Which is exactly why they became

19:10.250 --> 19:12.283
bullies and thieves
in the first place!

19:12.285 --> 19:15.686
These poor,
broken souls have nothing,

19:15.688 --> 19:19.991
and we are so lucky
to have everything.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.326
Theodore, let's give them
your headphones.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.996
Bernard, let's give them
your cuff links.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.931
Hot Wheels,
let's give them...

19:26.933 --> 19:29.333
Nah, they're not gonna want
anything of yours.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.670
What about you?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.038
What are you giving them?

19:34.040 --> 19:37.208
These are to
my Big Wheel.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.277
It's parked out front.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.015
That was a good thing
you did, Rallo.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.483
Uh-huh.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.651
(beeps)

19:46.653 --> 19:48.219
Hello, police?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.222
I'd like to report
a stolen Big Wheel.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.524
Those kids was dicks.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.826
Cleveland, if I
take this off

19:55.828 --> 19:58.062
and see Big Boob June
on a futon again,

19:58.064 --> 20:00.031
we are getting
a divorce.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.700
Here we are!

20:02.702 --> 20:05.303
♪

20:08.507 --> 20:09.874
Oh, my God!

20:09.876 --> 20:11.642
Cleveland, what the
hell is wrong with you?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.544
Is this your idea of
a romantic dinner?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.913
This is like something
Nicolas Cage would do.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.048
Donna, wait.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.516
I know it's strange,

20:18.518 --> 20:21.485
but it's important to me
that you like this place.

20:21.487 --> 20:22.553
Why?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.155
Because when I die--

20:24.157 --> 20:26.357
and let's be honest,
I'm going first--

20:26.359 --> 20:29.594
I want you to come visit me
and spend time with me.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.495
So I want you to have
good memories

20:31.497 --> 20:33.164
of us here together.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.498
Wow.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.601
That was actually...
thought out.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.003
Donna, may I have
this dance?

20:39.005 --> 20:42.206
You want me to literally
dance on our graves?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.842
Our future graves, yes.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.618
Hey, Donna, you want to join
the six feet under club?

20:53.620 --> 20:57.121
I don't need to join, but
I'll renew my membership.
Mm.
