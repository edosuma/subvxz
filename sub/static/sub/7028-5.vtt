You saved me.

18:42.199 --> 18:45.701
- It was nothing, babe.
- Seriously, Diego?

18:45.703 --> 18:47.136
You saved yourself?

18:47.138 --> 18:49.905
Why can't we
be more like them, huh?

18:51.442 --> 18:54.977
Everybody stop fighting.

18:54.979 --> 18:57.046
Yeah, it kind of just
fizzled out on its own.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.949
Well, then,
stay stopped fighting.

18:59.951 --> 19:03.786
Your petty feud is getting
in the way of true love.

19:03.788 --> 19:05.721
Tell them, Gael.

19:05.723 --> 19:08.324
Julio and I know
being together is forbidden,

19:08.326 --> 19:09.592
but we don't care.

19:09.594 --> 19:12.127
You guys together?
<i>Ah, que lindos.</i>

19:13.464 --> 19:15.431
I mean, holiday parties
might be awkward,

19:15.433 --> 19:17.566
but you guys are happy,
we're happy.

19:17.568 --> 19:19.768
They make
a cute couple.

19:19.770 --> 19:24.440
So, it's not forbidden?

19:24.442 --> 19:26.742
Oh, it doesn't make it
any less hot.

19:26.744 --> 19:29.345
- Right?
- Sure.

19:29.347 --> 19:33.315
Yay!
Together forever.

19:33.317 --> 19:37.252
I'll be home soon, boys.
I love you too.

19:37.254 --> 19:38.621
You know,
whenever I'm at work

19:38.623 --> 19:40.689
I realize how much I love
being your--

19:40.691 --> 19:41.824
Diego, quit hitting
your brother.

19:41.826 --> 19:43.525
I swear to God
when I get home.

19:43.527 --> 19:45.461
I'm never gonna be as cool
a villain as Armando.

19:45.463 --> 19:48.430
Listen to me 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

19:48.432 --> 19:49.865
You don't need a mustache.

19:49.867 --> 19:53.002
Your mustache
is right in there.

19:53.004 --> 19:55.938
You act a million times better
than Armando ever could.

You're a pretty good person
to have on my team.

20:07.518 --> 20:09.018
And I'm sorry I said
Kate and Diego

20:09.020 --> 20:11.453
were better than us.
We were so jealous of them.

20:11.455 --> 20:12.888
We could have done
the same thing they did--

20:12.890 --> 20:15.024
had a sham marriage
just for publicity.

20:15.026 --> 20:18.027
No way.
I'm happy as what we are.
