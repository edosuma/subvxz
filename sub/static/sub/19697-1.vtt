00:23.960 --> 00:26.719
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.759
We're back!

00:28.760 --> 00:32.600
- And we've got lots and lots of shiny new cars.
- That's right.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.079
That's right.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.920
In fact, here's a look at what's
coming up over the next seven weeks.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.719
It's on!

00:48.160 --> 00:49.439
Let's go racing!

01:04.120 --> 01:05.639
It's got a chicken!

01:05.640 --> 01:08.000
I'm done. Have the car, I'm out.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.879
The acceleration is enormous!

01:13.880 --> 01:14.920
Whoo!

01:15.920 --> 01:17.199
The way this is written,

01:17.200 --> 01:19.480
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.679
My knob's come off!

01:27.480 --> 01:29.359
Yes! What a thing!

01:32.200 --> 01:33.480
THAT is immature.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.439
Ooh. OK.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.759
All righty.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.920
Wow, that's a lot for the eyes.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.079
Looks OK to me.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.559
OK... let's kick it off with this.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.759
The LaFerrari.

01:50.760 --> 01:54.519
Costs Â£1 million, and only
500 will ever be built.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.199
Interesting, isn't it,
that adding "La" to a name

01:57.200 --> 01:59.319
makes it sound more exotic,

01:59.320 --> 02:02.360
whereas "Le" - not so much, really.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.159
I get it. I see what you did there.
You got... You got me.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.959
We don't need to go into your last name.
All right.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.159
Anyhow, the LaFerrari.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.119
You hear that, you think,
"Ferrari's VIP area," right?

02:16.120 --> 02:20.119
The fastest, the most
advanced, the most exclusive.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.199
Well, nearly. Because,
in the world of Ferrari,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.159
turns out there's a V-VIP area -

02:26.160 --> 02:29.079
somewhere off-limits to us mere commoners.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.800
Somewhere home to a truly
extraordinary machine.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.079
Here it is, the Ferrari FXXK.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.200
And, no, that name is NOT accidental.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.999
My - days.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.079
It's based on the bones of
the LaFerrari hypercar,

02:56.080 --> 02:58.960
but it's been intensified
in every department.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.519
Only 40 will ever exist,

03:03.520 --> 03:06.160
and it costs over £2 million.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.879
Or at least it would, if you could buy it.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.479
Which you can't. Even if
you're a zillionaire,

03:12.480 --> 03:15.479
you don't just phone up Ferrari
with your credit card details.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.999
No.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.159
First, you must have been
judged, in Ferrari's words,

03:20.160 --> 03:22.399
to "have the right mind-set."

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
You must be invited.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.639
In fact, the FXXK is so unattainable,

03:28.640 --> 03:32.160
I'm the first outsider ever
permitted to drive one.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.319
So, just for today,

03:41.320 --> 03:43.719
you can keep your LaFerraris,

03:43.720 --> 03:46.480
your everyday hypercars.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.199
Run by Bring Me The Horizon.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.679
Today, I've got more power,

03:54.680 --> 03:56.519
more lightness,

03:56.520 --> 03:58.279
more grip.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.920
So much MORE.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.040
The speed is preposterous!

04:19.200 --> 04:20.839
If you believe it,

04:20.839 --> 04:24.280
it has 1,050 horsepower.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.560
That's 87 more than the LaFerrari road car.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.439
It's SO physical.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.000
It gets inside your body.

04:40.720 --> 04:46.400
Sensational, addictive,
mighty, corrupting power!

04:49.080 --> 04:52.439
0 to 60 takes just over two seconds,

04:52.440 --> 04:55.159
but this car lives way beyond that.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.999
Just keeps going...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.760
until your brain implodes...

05:00.160 --> 05:01.960
like a collapsing star!

05:05.200 --> 05:08.679
Like the LaFerrari, the
FXXK has a KERS system

05:08.680 --> 05:11.519
harvesting energy wasted underbraking.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.959
If I brake hard now,

05:12.960 --> 05:17.359
I can feel a kind of pressure behind
my eyeballs, forcing them forward.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.319
But here the system is F1 spec,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.879
and when it uses that energy
to boost the performance

05:22.880 --> 05:25.120
of the 6.3-litre V12 engine...

05:26.280 --> 05:28.239
it just bungs you down the road.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.079
It's not like a normal car
experience of acceleration.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.040
Here we go. I accelerate in third and...

05:36.240 --> 05:39.399
I'm 100 yards further than I thought.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.840
Good Lord.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.439
And then there's the traction control.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.199
Because Ferrari doesn't want to
kill its wealthiest customers,

05:47.200 --> 05:49.599
they're some of the most
sophisticated systems

05:49.600 --> 05:51.639
I've ever encountered.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.439
I can just bury the throttle
coming out of turns,

05:54.440 --> 05:57.159
and it just manages it beautifully.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.479
I suppose part of the
thrill of this car is...

06:00.480 --> 06:03.879
building up the courage to switch them off.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.480
Well, you only live once.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.640
Yes! I'm alive! I'm alive!

06:29.040 --> 06:32.520
Now, this is a good way to ruin
some very expensive tyres.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.639
Fortunately, changing them is easy,

06:35.640 --> 06:38.519
because your £2 million FXXK

06:38.520 --> 06:41.000
also comes with its very
own Ferrari pit crew...

06:42.560 --> 06:45.519
just like a modern Formula One car.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.279
But, unlike a modern Formula One car,

06:48.280 --> 06:50.799
it doesn't need to comply
with a great big rule book.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.840
In fact, it doesn't need to comply
with the rule book... well, at all.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.079
Ferrari basically said to its engineers,

06:58.080 --> 07:00.599
"Knock yourselves out, do
whatever the hell you want."

07:00.600 --> 07:02.159
"Just make it fast."

07:02.160 --> 07:03.720
"CRAZY fast!"

07:07.720 --> 07:09.560
And this being Ferrari...

07:10.800 --> 07:14.000
crazy fast on the
straights is just the start.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.160
The true nature of this car
lies in the way it corners.

07:22.800 --> 07:27.639
The faster you go, the harder it sticks.
It's like a giant magnet.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.760
You can't see it but, boy, can you feel it.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.320
It's lawless, savage.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.480
It's motorsport unlimited.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.839
Unbound by rules,

07:43.840 --> 07:47.679
the FXXK can delve deep
into the dark art of aero.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.239
From that enormous active
wing to the insane diffuser,

07:51.240 --> 07:55.560
its hunger for downforce crushes
the tyres into the tarmac.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.359
The aero through this left-hander.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.080
Wow! Into the deck.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.240
Right now, it feels about the
fasted thing ever made, to me.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.999
'The performance of the
FXXK is so extraordinary,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.519
'it recalibrates your understanding of...

08:19.520 --> 08:21.759
'what a car is capable of.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.999
'It's wonderful, intoxicating.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.959
'It's so cutting-edge, it's...'

08:26.960 --> 08:30.479
I got quite a high water temperature
now, so I need to just cool it down.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.400
'..Well, it's high maintenance.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.879
'And that means your pit crew
will spend a lot of time

08:36.880 --> 08:39.639
'fiddling about with stuff
you don't understand.'

08:39.640 --> 08:41.839
Needs a reset on the, er...

08:41.840 --> 08:43.078
Er...

08:43.080 --> 08:46.519
And this ultimate Ferrari
thoroughbred is so extreme,

08:46.520 --> 08:48.879
you can't drive it on the road,

08:48.880 --> 08:51.920
and it doesn't qualify for
any existing race series.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.359
So, as a car, the FXXK
doesn't really make sense.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.079
But it's not meant to.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.800
It's not really a car.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.039
What it is is a ticket...

09:11.040 --> 09:14.400
to the most exclusive private
members club on the planet.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.960
And this club has one final
members-only benefit.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.039
You see, up to now, the car
has been holding back,

09:27.040 --> 09:30.760
saving power to make sure its
batteries never run flat.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.119
But the FXXK has something
called Qualify Mode,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.439
and that gives you all the petrol power

09:38.440 --> 09:41.640
and all the electric power
in one massive hit.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.919
Maximum attack for one lap only.
And, well...

09:46.920 --> 09:49.159
since I've only got one lap left, well...

09:49.160 --> 09:50.680
you can't take it with you.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.719
1,050 horsepower!

10:26.720 --> 10:30.000
What a car! What a day!

10:43.000 --> 10:46.920
Drink it up. Drink it
up, it's the last lap.

10:54.920 --> 10:59.039
Unbelievable. I'll never
get to do that again.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.320
I'm staggered I've had a chance
to do it in the first place.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.040
When the world's electric...

11:09.880 --> 11:14.440
I think I'll remember this
day more than every other.

11:24.960 --> 11:29.039
Ooh. - Well, I didn't crash.
- No, you didn't. No, what an incredible car.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.839
And I've got to be honest,
you drove the ass off it.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.239
One tiny point though, and
I don't mean to be picky,

11:34.240 --> 11:36.839
but you know this whole
exclusive club thing?

11:36.840 --> 11:38.319
OK, so what you're saying is,

11:38.320 --> 11:41.759
if you're a very, very
special friend of Ferrari,

11:41.760 --> 11:46.119
you might just be lucky enough
to receive an invitation

11:46.120 --> 11:49.439
- to give them £2 million.
- Correct.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.519
And in return, you get a car that, yeah,

11:51.520 --> 11:55.599
is very fast and very pretty, but
it's essentially useless, right?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.519
I mean, you can't drive it on the road,

11:57.520 --> 11:59.399
you can't enter it in any race series,

11:59.400 --> 12:01.959
you need a team of mechanics
to keep it running...

12:01.960 --> 12:04.199
Also correct.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.000
That's good business.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.039
It is if you're Ferrari.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.359
Now, this is the point we usually
hand the car over to Stig

12:12.360 --> 12:15.039
to thrash around our test
track, but today, we can't.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.599
It's just too cold out there.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.399
The FXXK is on racing slicks and it
just won't get hot enough to work.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.439
We're sorry.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.719
But we'll try to coax it back again
for a lap later in the series

12:24.720 --> 12:27.839
- when the weather warms up a bit.
- Yes, we will. Rory.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.359
What a car.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.799
And the high horsepower
thrills don't end there,

12:31.800 --> 12:34.959
because later this series, and I
can't believe I got to do this,

12:34.960 --> 12:38.399
but I drive the new Renault Twingo.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.879
- Yes. - Wahey! - Yes.
- Ho, ho! APPLAUSE.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.440
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.119
OK. Now it is time to introduce
this week's studio guest.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.319
He's the star of Atonement,
X-Men and Split.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.720
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome James McAvoy.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.160
Welcome, welcome.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.399
Now, James, I know you didn't get a
chauffeur to drop you down today.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.959
- You drove yourself, right?
- I did, yes. - OK, what did you drive?

13:15.960 --> 13:19.799
- I drove my RS3. - Nice, little pocket rocket.
- Little ninja, yeah.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.559
- 300 plus horsepower there.
- If you say so.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.199
Yeah, I just know it goes fast, man.
It goes fast.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.759
So you have a driver's licence now,

13:26.760 --> 13:29.359
but didn't you drive for years without one?

13:29.360 --> 13:32.239
This is the weird thing. I
played a car thief in Shameless

13:32.240 --> 13:34.039
and I had to drive many beautiful cars

13:34.040 --> 13:36.599
and nobody ever asked me if
I had a driver's licence,

13:36.600 --> 13:38.119
so I didn't, I didn't offer it up.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.359
- I didn't get a driver's licence until six years later.
- Hang on.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.479
You're painting quite a picture for us.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.719
Any other bad behaviour you
want to come clean with?

13:45.720 --> 13:48.599
I do actually have a clean driver's
licence, but I did have a...

13:48.600 --> 13:52.479
I had a provisional driver's licence
just for riding a 125 scooter

13:52.480 --> 13:56.039
before I grew up and got
a big bike, and, erm...

13:56.040 --> 13:59.199
I got 11 points on my provisional licence.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.759
Yeah.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.559
The guy, the policeman that took me aside

14:03.560 --> 14:06.079
was like, "I'm probably going
to let you off with it",

14:06.080 --> 14:09.199
and his partner was like shouting
from the car going, "No way!"

14:09.200 --> 14:11.799
"He's going down! This is unbelievable!"

14:11.800 --> 14:13.599
So, yeah, they put me
in the back of the car

14:13.600 --> 14:15.159
and made me feel like a drug dealer.

14:15.160 --> 14:19.239
All right, now, you didn't just come
down here to enjoy our company,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.559
because, frankly, who would do that?
No, no.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.359
- You came here to drive fast around our track.
- Yes.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.359
And the first thing that everyone
here should know is that

14:27.360 --> 14:30.320
the original Top Gear track is back!

14:35.600 --> 14:39.039
And here's the other thing you
need to know, we've got a new car.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.279
And after all those Lianas
and Lacettis and Cee'ds...

14:42.280 --> 14:44.719
- I'm still a big fan of the Cee'd.
- That's cos you were quick in it.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.879
We decided it was high time for
something a bit more exciting,

14:47.880 --> 14:50.599
something rear-wheel drive, something fast.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.079
That's right, but not too fast,

14:52.080 --> 14:54.119
cos we're talking about celebrities here,

14:54.120 --> 14:55.359
not responsible adults.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.679
Which meant there was
only one car for the job,

14:57.680 --> 15:00.479
and I mean literally only one car.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.679
Introducing our new reasonably fast car,

15:04.680 --> 15:06.800
it's the Toyota GT86.

15:12.360 --> 15:16.879
Drive it well and it's so much fun,
but get it wrong and you will spin.

15:16.880 --> 15:21.519
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, so do I. From experience I can guarantee it.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.239
Right, so, obviously we're not
going to send you out there

15:24.240 --> 15:26.599
without a little bit of instruction, so...

15:26.600 --> 15:29.479
Do you remember at school that one teacher

15:29.480 --> 15:33.359
who really inspired you,
nurtured you, believed in you?

15:33.360 --> 15:38.079
Well, our instructor is
exactly the opposite of that.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.640
He's mad, he's tiny, his head is
very shiny, it's Chris Harris.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.599
Welcome to the Toyota GT86.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.399
Your performance reflects on me.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.280
- All right, mate.
- So you've got to listen. - What? - OK?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.239
Aim for the 50 metre board.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.599
Don't try and be funny. Fourth gear.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.160
When I say "brake", brake. Brake!

16:05.040 --> 16:07.279
- Listen! Listen, James.
- I am.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.399
Over that way. Do what you're told.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.079
My hand's over there. Look, third gear.
Third gear.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.919
Third gear, that's second, you...

16:13.920 --> 16:16.360
Third! Third!

16:18.880 --> 16:20.439
Argh!

16:20.440 --> 16:21.599
Aw!

16:21.600 --> 16:22.880
- OK.
- Whoo!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.279
You have to listen to the next bit,

16:27.280 --> 16:30.439
otherwise we both end up being
looked for through dental records.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.960
Fourth gear. Fourth gear.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.879
Yes!

16:41.880 --> 16:44.559
I wish they'd given me someone
talented for this first episode,

16:44.560 --> 16:47.320
cos it would look so good
for my coaching skills.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.639
My lord.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.319
And over the line.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.560
And stop.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.119
And never...

16:57.120 --> 16:59.159
do that to me again.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.640
- You loved it.
- Jesus Christ. - You loved it.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.839
Well, very nice, very nice.

17:11.839 --> 17:15.079
I'm beginning to see why that
career as a hostage negotiator

17:15.079 --> 17:16.479
never worked out for you.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.239
OK, seriously, Harris, that is
no way to speak to our guest.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.839
Absolutely not.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.239
Do you know what? I kind of liked it.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.759
I like to be treated rough sometimes.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.919
That's just...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.759
Well, anyway, we are looking
forward to seeing your timed lap

17:29.760 --> 17:32.559
a little bit later. But
first, here's a question...

17:32.560 --> 17:36.679
£150,000, something fun for
the summer, what do you buy?

17:36.680 --> 17:39.319
- Er, GT3 RS.
- OK, Rory?

17:39.320 --> 17:41.599
McLaren 570?

17:41.600 --> 17:44.720
Yellow Ford Capri with black stripes on it.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.679
- OK, all good. - Thanks.
- All good. All wrong.

17:49.680 --> 17:55.920
Because the most fun you can have
for £150,000 is one of these.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.879
- That's a Hobbit caravan.
- No. No, that's a pressure washer.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.199
So it's a pressure washer
for £150,000 Sterling.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.599
What are you going to wash with that?

18:07.600 --> 18:12.319
I'm going to wash a melon, a shed
and a Volvo. Check this out.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.759
This is the Karcher Ecomaster mark three.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.599
It runs at about 2,800 bar of pressure.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.919
That's... about 40,611 PSI.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.639
Roughly. Exactly.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.719
This cleans stuff really well.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.000
Watch this.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.719
There you have it!

19:06.720 --> 19:08.279
Clean!

19:08.280 --> 19:09.880
Clean as a whistle!

19:14.960 --> 19:18.000
Am I right? That's good.
That thing's great.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.639
Your handwriting is appalling.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.199
Don't pretend you're not jealous.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.319
Right, I need to vent about something.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.519
The other night I was watching Ronin, OK?

19:28.520 --> 19:31.319
- Ronin, that film that came out, what? 20 years ago?
- Yeah.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.959
- Always up-to-date.
- Stop that. Look,

19:32.960 --> 19:35.879
one of the best on-screen car
chases of all time. Agreed?

19:35.880 --> 19:37.519
- Yes.
- OK.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.879
But I've spotted something
that's troubling me, vexing me.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.920
Have a look at this.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.799
Wait there! There!

19:47.800 --> 19:50.439
- How annoying is that? Did you see that?
- What? - See what?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.679
- You saw that.
- What?! - There.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.759
BMW E34 M51990, turbine design wheel,

19:56.760 --> 19:59.199
cool for brake distance,
that kind of thing.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.239
Cut to... That's not an M5 wheel.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.279
That's the...

20:04.280 --> 20:08.239
That's from a 535i. It's
a continuity nightmare.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.480
How long are you planning
on being a virgin?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.839
I could help you out.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.639
Look, you work in film, you
saw that, that's a nightmare.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.479
Yeah, right?
- This has been bothering me... Can I do one more? - Go ahead.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.879
Bothering me since 1987.
Withnail And I. Great film?

20:30.880 --> 20:34.039
- A wonderful film. - You must know it line by line.
- Yeah... Go on, then.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.279
Continuity nightmare.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.680
Watch this.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.079
Withnail, car.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.439
There!

20:42.440 --> 20:44.759
- Where? What?
- You saw it.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.359
- Saw what?
- You saw it!

20:46.360 --> 20:50.199
Withnail is set in 1969, OK?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.679
It's the end of the '60s, it's apocalyptic.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.439
Right in the background is a
Volvo 340 DL, launched in...

20:56.440 --> 21:00.679
1976! Even worse, the red smudge behind it,

21:00.680 --> 21:02.439
Nissan Sunny, 1981.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.439
It's terrible.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.359
Imagine, OK, Gladiator,
Russell Crowe struts in,

21:07.360 --> 21:09.199
"I'm the father of someone... got murdered,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.919
"I'm generally fed up with
life," toga, look down below.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.959
Air Jordans.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.159
You're not going to suffer that.
It's not good.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.839
It is literally,

21:18.840 --> 21:21.919
literally... nothing like that. OK?

21:21.920 --> 21:24.879
In fairness, though, I
do hate film mistakes.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.559
- You know Mad Max Fury Road?
- Yeah.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.519
OK, if you look really close,
really, really closely,

21:31.520 --> 21:33.199
don't blink, you'll miss it,

21:33.200 --> 21:36.080
you'll see that they cast
Tom Hardy instead of me.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.199
Look real close. You can see it.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.119
Anyway, moving on, a couple
of months back the producers

21:43.120 --> 21:45.919
told us to tackle a serious
consumer question.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.599
Specifically this one...

21:47.600 --> 21:51.279
What is the most reliable
new car on sale today?

21:51.280 --> 21:53.279
And we said, "Well,
that's a stupid question."

21:53.280 --> 21:56.119
"New cars can't be reliable. They're new."

21:56.120 --> 21:59.559
"You have to earn reliability
over lots and lots of miles."

21:59.560 --> 22:03.399
If a car's driven to, say, the moon
and back, and it's still going,

22:03.400 --> 22:05.879
now that's proof of reliability.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.839
That's right, so our producer
said, "All right, you're on."

22:08.840 --> 22:10.479
They told us each to go buy a car

22:10.480 --> 22:12.599
that HAD driven to the moon and back.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.519
Well, the Earth equivalent.

22:14.520 --> 22:18.399
480,000 miles on the clock. So we did.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.359
And they shipped them off for a
series of reliability challenges

22:21.360 --> 22:23.119
in the middle of nowhere.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.640
A little place called Kazakhstan.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.839
So...

22:39.840 --> 22:41.719
Kazakhstan.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.520
Shall we go and find our cars?

22:47.520 --> 22:50.399
- Three containers, gentlemen.
- Who wants to go first?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.920
- Can I go first?
- Go for it.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.760
You're going to love it.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.399
What do you think he's got?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.200
Some kind of mental issue.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.839
- It's definitely a sports car, no?
- Yeah, it's got to be.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.359
- A high mileage Ferrari, perhaps?
- Maserati.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.239
- High mileage Maserati?
- Yeah.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.679
Which is, you know, a horrible idea.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.159
- 'But Chris surprised us both.'
- That's not Italian.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.799
That's not Italian at all. RORY LAUGHS.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.599
A Volvo?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.839
The Volvo V70.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.079
You want reliability, you go to
Sweden, gentlemen. You know that.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.799
She's a minter.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.039
I don't want to patronise you, but
you know that in the Arctic Circle

23:32.040 --> 23:36.039
a reliable car is the difference
between life and death.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.599
But you're not playing a housewife
in this film. That's the thing.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.319
Look, I know, it's not going
to set any pulses racing,

23:42.320 --> 23:44.999
but V70s in this generation
are very, very strong.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.599
Manual gearbox for a bit of fun,
and there's a button in there

23:48.600 --> 23:50.079
that's for heated seats,

23:50.080 --> 23:52.719
and I wonder whether either of
you two have that function.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.280
Shall we see your car, Matt?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.120
That's really sad, mate.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.479
Forget Sweden.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.199
You want reliability?

24:04.200 --> 24:06.400
He's got it!

24:07.640 --> 24:09.719
- Right, here we go.
- He's got a Merc.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.319
Now, he thinks he's just
bought into the ultimate brand

24:13.320 --> 24:16.760
- of reliability, but little does he know.
- Come on now.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.079
Explain yourself.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.079
Mercedes, the symbol,

24:22.080 --> 24:25.439
the quintessential symbol
of quality, right?

24:25.440 --> 24:26.959
You go anywhere in the world,

24:26.960 --> 24:29.559
you see these E-Classes
just rattling along,

24:29.560 --> 24:33.879
clicking off the miles, reliability,
reliability, reliability.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.479
Do you understand the
significance of the colour?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.319
It's like a beige, kind of like
a granny's living room colour.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.839
- You know why it's that colour?
- I don't know.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.919
That was a taxi cab, that
was a German taxi cab,

24:44.920 --> 24:47.079
- probably from the Berlin area.
- What?

24:47.080 --> 24:50.039
So that's had the hardest life imaginable.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.159
While Matt came to terms
with his new taxi...

24:53.160 --> 24:56.999
- But it's still an E-Class.
- ..I went to fetch... mine.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.799
London Calling by the Clash.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.440
My God.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.799
What were you thinking?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.640
I don't know what to say.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.639
Look, you want to talk reliability?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.639
This has got to be in the conversation, OK?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.319
London taxi, utterly bombproof.

25:20.320 --> 25:24.679
Come the apocalypse, there will only
be cockroaches and London cabs.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.559
I don't know where to begin, Rory.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.879
Look, first of all,

25:27.880 --> 25:30.359
these vehicles are designed to
cover very short distances.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.759
Maybe 40, 50 miles at a stretch.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.919
Beyond that, they are purgatory.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.959
Well, that's neither here nor there.

25:36.960 --> 25:41.119
Also, people visit London to come
and see the London black cab.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.399
No, they don't.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.999
They get in that piece of crap
to go see something else.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.359
Tell me the best thing about this car.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.799
The best thing about this car,
turning circle, 7.62 metres.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.239
I can run rings around your cars.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.839
Right.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.799
But before he could get in and show
us, a man appeared in an old Lada.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.520
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.840
Wheel bearing's gone.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.599
"You and your high-milers
will now undertake"

26:08.600 --> 26:11.879
"a series of reliability
challenges as you cross Kazakhstan"

26:11.880 --> 26:14.079
"to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,"

26:14.080 --> 26:17.199
"which is home to the Soviet
Union's space programme."

26:17.200 --> 26:20.919
"There's a rocket launch in two days.
Be there."

26:20.920 --> 26:23.639
- We're going to a rocket launch?
- No, no, no.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.359
Those of us that have a car that's
going to make it to a rocket launch

26:26.360 --> 26:27.799
are going to a rocket launch.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.199
You two are going to die on the Steppe.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.920
Why do you have to be like that?

26:33.920 --> 26:36.679
Yes, ahead of us lay the Steppe,

26:36.680 --> 26:41.679
a vast desert of unforgiving
terrain and extreme temperatures,

26:41.680 --> 26:44.199
certain to test our
high-miler's reliability.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.519
The journey would lead us
to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

26:48.520 --> 26:51.880
the world's largest, oldest
space launch facility.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.079
And the home of the
Russian space programme.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.479
Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin,

26:59.480 --> 27:02.719
even the first piece of the
International Space Station,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.239
all were launched from
this 3,000 square mile

27:05.240 --> 27:06.960
Russian-controlled facility...

27:09.880 --> 27:11.959
but with only two days to get there,

27:11.960 --> 27:13.680
we had a lot of ground to cover.

27:17.240 --> 27:20.359
I was just thinking, you see a
car with 100,000 miles on it,

27:20.360 --> 27:23.199
you think, right, time to get a new
one, that's pretty much worn out.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.319
That's not what we've
done, we've gone for cars

27:25.320 --> 27:28.879
that have 500,000 miles on
them, and mine runs fine.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.639
- How does yours run?
- My cab hasn't aged a bit.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.880
What did you say? It was a piece of.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.519
This taxi is a bit of a shed.

27:41.520 --> 27:45.319
I've just discovered that
my heating doesn't work -

27:45.320 --> 27:48.279
and that's a bad thing,
because in Kazakhstan

27:48.280 --> 27:51.840
it's currently minus 12 degrees outside.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.919
First impressions, very impressive.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.399
Doesn't really rattle or
shake, it's remarkable.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.639
Let's face it, Volvos are so reliable.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.159
If this thing does break down,

28:03.160 --> 28:05.960
there'd probably be a national
day of mourning in Sweden.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.919
Guys, I don't have any heating
whatsoever in my cab.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.439
The sun's out, Rory. Think
positive, think warm.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.480
I'm going to die of pneumonia, man!

28:20.800 --> 28:24.319
'Heading out of town, we
made a start for Baikonur

28:24.320 --> 28:27.999
'and the bustle quickly dwindled.'

28:28.000 --> 28:31.719
Look at it, it's just acres
and acres of nothing.

28:31.720 --> 28:35.439
It's like... Stoke!

28:35.440 --> 28:37.439
'And, as the road turned to dirt,

28:37.440 --> 28:41.919
'we got the feeling this might not
be the way to Baikonur after all.'

28:41.920 --> 28:46.079
Why are we doing this? Can't
we find another road?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.719
'But then...'

28:47.720 --> 28:49.839
Look at that.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.679
- That is huge.
- Thanks, Chris.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.599
'We had stumbled across
our first opportunity

28:55.600 --> 28:57.159
'for a spot of competition.'

28:57.160 --> 28:58.759
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

28:58.760 --> 29:00.559
I think I am thinking what you're thinking.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.639
That looks like a race track to me.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.240
I think we need to get it on.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.119
'Our first test of reliability
would be an impromptu quarry race

29:11.120 --> 29:14.199
'down to the bottom, back to the top.

29:14.200 --> 29:19.080
'First past the cow's head... wins.'

29:20.680 --> 29:24.119
Gentlemen, may the best
man and his machine win.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.999
Come on, little black cab.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.880
Three, two, one... go.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.519
That's hopeless. I've just been
overtaken by a bloody London taxi!

29:35.520 --> 29:38.319
I've got better traction than Chris! Yeah!

29:38.320 --> 29:40.639
Matt's quick, though.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.199
- Ho!
- He's in front.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.200
Come on, chase him down, chase him down.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.440
He's gaining.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.719
Come on, come on.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.959
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

29:56.960 --> 29:58.120
Ha-ha!

29:59.120 --> 30:02.520
Rory with the big move up the inside.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.120
We're in front! The black cab is in front!

30:09.440 --> 30:11.519
Get out of the way!

30:11.520 --> 30:13.679
Hey, hey, watch the paint!

30:13.680 --> 30:16.599
Come on, baby, come on, hold it together.

30:16.600 --> 30:20.679
OK, we're coming around the loop.
The turning circle coming in.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.759
More than handy there.

30:22.760 --> 30:28.519
79 horsepower! 0-60 in 21 seconds.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.679
Sorry!

30:30.680 --> 30:33.919
And we've destroyed the Merc and the Volvo.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.519
This is hopeless.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.559
Slow up the hill. I got him, I got him.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.520
Matt's gaining, Matt's gaining.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.160
Here we go.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.399
No!

30:46.400 --> 30:48.719
- Thank you!
- No!

30:48.720 --> 30:51.000
Yeah.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.520
Right, come on, old girl.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.999
Here comes Chris.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.200
I'm on the defensive.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.680
Hold him off, hold him off! Hold him off!
Hold him off...

31:09.600 --> 31:10.919
Matt's slowing down.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.280
What the...?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.560
What the.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.839
Whoo!

31:25.840 --> 31:28.519
Come on! Yes!

31:28.520 --> 31:30.999
Ha-ha!

31:31.000 --> 31:33.280
Not quite the end I'd expected.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.599
- Well, what happened?
- What do you mean, what happened?

31:42.600 --> 31:44.439
- You weren't moving.
- I lost drive.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.679
Coming up the hill, the
transmission kind of let go.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.359
I'll tell you what happened.

31:48.360 --> 31:51.919
- I just won the race in the black cab!
- Honestly, I'm disappointed.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.079
I was coming past you,
and you were stationary.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.599
- You weren't coming past me.
- I was. I was pushing you up the hill.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.279
No, I was putting the moves
on you, I was blocking you.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.359
So you reckon you were not
being pushed up the hill?

32:01.360 --> 32:03.079
I was defensive driving
the hell out of you.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.359
- You weren't aware you were being pushed up the hill?
- Yeah,

32:05.360 --> 32:07.319
but that was enough to stay ahead!

32:07.320 --> 32:09.679
You would have pushed me
over the finish line!

32:09.680 --> 32:11.519
I'm feeling slightly guilty.

32:11.520 --> 32:15.039
This car has lived for 13
years and 570,000 miles.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.519
And I've had it 42 miles.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.279
42 miles!

32:19.280 --> 32:22.799
The last one was probably the most special.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.599
- Meanwhile...
- Yeah. - ..Pristine, good as new.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.200
I can change that quite quickly for you.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.639
'Our quarry race had taken its toll -

32:35.640 --> 32:40.199
'but, after a few hours,
we were back on the road.'

32:40.200 --> 32:44.320
Your Volvo looks like the Terminator
near the end of the film.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.839
I removed a quarter of the front of the car

32:51.840 --> 32:56.239
and the warning system simply tells
me, "Bulb failure, dipped beam".

32:56.240 --> 32:58.760
That's how tough this car is.
That's Nordic strength.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.839
And also, the airbox has
been a bit squashed

33:02.840 --> 33:05.799
which means it now sounds like
a full-house Audi Quattro.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.880
So, actually, I've improved the car.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.319
It does sound good.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.399
That is nice.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.520
Ba-a!

33:19.880 --> 33:22.559
'At last, we were on the road to Baikonur

33:22.560 --> 33:25.839
'and the producers had told us
to make a stop at the next town,

33:25.840 --> 33:27.759
'a place called Kyzylorda.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.759
'So, we pressed on,

33:29.760 --> 33:33.719
'and Chris took it upon himself
to keep us entertained.'

33:33.720 --> 33:36.959
Were you to drive from one side
of Kazakhstan to the other

33:36.960 --> 33:39.799
it's the same as driving
from London to Istanbul.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.599
It's basically the size of Western Europe.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.439
Is it really?

33:44.440 --> 33:49.359
On a smaller scale, this country
was the origin of the apple tree,

33:49.360 --> 33:52.519
so the apple was invented here.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.079
Was it really?

33:54.080 --> 33:58.959
The Kazakhs were also the first
people to domesticate the horse,

33:58.960 --> 34:00.360
the humble horse.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.439
'But, before Chris could go full corduroy,

34:05.440 --> 34:09.279
'we arrived in Kyzylorda and,
at the local sports ground,

34:09.280 --> 34:13.880
'we discovered apples and horses
weren't all they had invented.'

34:15.600 --> 34:21.039
'They were playing a game called kokpar.
Basically, that's goat polo.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.239
'It's a professional sport in Kazakhstan,

34:23.239 --> 34:26.400
'and the aim is to get the
goat carcass in the goal.'

34:30.719 --> 34:36.159
I got to say, this is, right
up there with some of the, um,

34:36.159 --> 34:38.360
grossest shit I've ever seen.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.559
'As we wondered what else
the afternoon had in store,

34:50.560 --> 34:52.478
'a challenge arrived.'

34:52.480 --> 34:55.799
It says, "You will need now take
on some local high-mile heroes"

34:55.800 --> 34:58.479
"in a simple game of tag."

34:58.480 --> 35:00.719
"If you tag another car, they're out."

35:00.720 --> 35:04.319
"If you get tagged, you're out."

35:04.320 --> 35:06.560
"Last car driving is the winner."

35:09.200 --> 35:11.759
'Apparently, goat polo was just a warm up.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.559
'And, as we took to the field,

35:13.560 --> 35:16.600
'the atmosphere in the stands was electric.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.159
'To prove which of our high-milers

35:20.160 --> 35:22.519
'was the most rugged performance machine,

35:22.520 --> 35:24.679
'we'll be going up against
not just each other

35:24.680 --> 35:27.439
'but three Steppe-hardened Lada workhorses.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.840
'Proven benchmarks of reliability...'

35:31.080 --> 35:34.800
'..driven by a crack squad of local talent.

35:35.960 --> 35:39.439
'So, with all six cars
spaced out around the track,

35:39.440 --> 35:43.240
'it was time for tag.'

35:44.560 --> 35:47.640
Whoop, whoop, whoop. Let's go racing!

35:51.040 --> 35:52.839
Here we go!

35:52.840 --> 35:55.840
Come on, baby. Let's do this one to London.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.919
That Lada is mine!

35:58.920 --> 36:01.680
Hey, little red Lada, I'm coming after you.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.480
They're surprisingly quick,
these Ladas, these local hands.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.280
I think I've got the Kazakhstani
rallying champion in front of me.

36:16.360 --> 36:20.480
'With the Volvo and taxi both
struggling in the early stages...'

36:22.560 --> 36:25.399
'..it was Matt's Mercedes
making all the moves.'

36:25.400 --> 36:28.520
I got this red guy, I got him, I got him!

36:31.560 --> 36:33.039
Matt's got the red Lada.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.920
'But Matt had forgotten
to check his mirrors.'

36:37.480 --> 36:39.639
Damn! CHEERING

36:39.640 --> 36:41.559
I'm out. I'm out.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.119
'Having taken out the Merc,

36:43.120 --> 36:46.879
'the little blue Lada
had a taste for blood.'

36:46.880 --> 36:48.920
I'm going to hit the brake
and let him fly past me!

36:50.480 --> 36:53.359
He's missed! The blue Lada has missed!

36:53.360 --> 36:57.639
'But then, it wasn't the blue
Lada I needed to worry about.'

36:57.640 --> 36:59.279
Harris is behind me.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.560
No, no, no, no!

37:01.640 --> 37:03.479
Give you a little tap, Rory.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.200
Harris has got me!

37:06.840 --> 37:09.320
A slight bonnet issue now,
a slight bonnet issue.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.559
'With one increasingly battered
Volvo left in the running,

37:17.560 --> 37:20.719
'it should have been easy pickings
for the two remaining Ladas,

37:20.720 --> 37:23.279
'but Harris doesn't give up easily.'

37:23.280 --> 37:25.600
I'm on the blue Lada now.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.999
Come on, Harris, get him, get
him, get him, get him, get him!

37:31.000 --> 37:32.720
I'm going to tap him, I'm going to tap him.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.000
A bit harsh, but there we go.
He needed to know I was there!

37:41.960 --> 37:44.240
Right, come on. This is the endgame.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.000
He's chasing down the last Lada right now.
I think he might do it.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.839
I can't actually see anything. Where is he?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.759
Ooh, there he is. Nudge.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.360
He's got him!

38:00.840 --> 38:02.519
Victory.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.280
Finally, the Volvo gets something.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.279
Way to go, Harris, all right!

38:09.280 --> 38:11.399
Why is he always finishing
races with his bonnet up?

38:11.400 --> 38:15.280
I... It's an aero device, gives me
a bit of extra front downforce.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.759
A couple more screws in the
bonnet this time, I think.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.239
Yeah, I think so. We'll get there.
We'll get the old girl to Baikonur.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.479
I want to see a rocket go off.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.960
To Baikonur!

38:37.680 --> 38:41.599
You know, honestly, before that trip,

38:41.600 --> 38:44.199
I had no idea that Kazakhstan was real.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.319
I thought it was one of
those made-up places

38:46.320 --> 38:48.280
like Timbuktu or Guernsey.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.400
Those are both real places.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.719
I know. GENTLE LAUGHTER.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.959
OK, James, to recap what happened there

38:57.960 --> 38:59.959
for everyone's benefit and yours is that

38:59.960 --> 39:03.160
the taxi won the race around the quarry.
All right!

39:04.280 --> 39:07.119
- Yeah, yeah?
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance!

39:07.120 --> 39:11.199
I won the race around the
goat sacrifice temple.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.959
Yeah, and Matt's Mercedes...

39:12.960 --> 39:16.159
No, no, no, don't, don't do it.
Don't bad-mouth the Mercedes.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.999
Don't do it, because we're in the presence

39:18.000 --> 39:20.639
of another lover of classic Merc, right?

39:20.640 --> 39:23.519
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Am I right? Now, is it true

39:23.520 --> 39:26.919
that you once owned Idi Amin's Mercedes SL?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.879
Erm...

39:28.880 --> 39:30.959
I was in a movie called The
Last King Of Scotland,

39:30.960 --> 39:34.119
and at the end of that movie, they
gave me this car that I drove in,

39:34.120 --> 39:35.719
which I didn't know at the time

39:35.720 --> 39:37.599
but it had belonged to somebody

39:37.600 --> 39:39.999
and Idi Amin had given it to that person.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.959
So they said at the end of
the movie I could have it.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.079
But, again, I didn't
have a driver's licence

39:44.080 --> 39:47.199
and I didn't really fancy
driving it back from Uganda.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.279
So I left it. I just left it there.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.799
I think they gave it to my driver,
he was a nice guy called Fred.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.199
Nice. Way to go, Fred.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.999
Right, now, it's time to find out
how you went around the track

39:58.000 --> 40:02.639
in our new reasonably fast car. Come on.
How did it go out there?

40:02.640 --> 40:06.279
Well, I don't think it went that well.
But it was a tonne of fun.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.159
- Well, what do you think? Let's see how you did.
- OK.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.799
'So, here we go, then.
Soaking wet track for James.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.919
'Off the line. Traction control on.'

40:14.920 --> 40:17.839
Big balls. Big, big balls,
that's all you need.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.719
'I don't disagree with you. Coming
up towards the first corner.'

40:21.720 --> 40:25.279
Wetter than a waterfall in a monsoon.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.279
'This braking's going to be tough.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.639
'There's a direction change
and also a surface change.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.719
'The grip levels there are terrible.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.799
'Best to stay on the track, I find, there!'

40:33.800 --> 40:35.399
Shut it!

40:35.400 --> 40:37.999
'Blending left, turning right into Chicago.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.039
'The inside line is off the
frame at the moment so,

40:41.040 --> 40:42.959
'actually, there's grip
around the outside.'

40:42.960 --> 40:44.240
Come on!

40:45.760 --> 40:47.959
'Now, this is the long
drag toward Hammerhead.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.959
'Big braking has triggered
the warning lights,

40:49.960 --> 40:51.799
'you were braking so
hard, that must be good.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.399
'The car's going to oversteer a bit, is it?
Yeah, there it goes.'

40:54.400 --> 40:55.439
Whoo!

40:55.440 --> 40:58.519
'I'd like to say you caught that. It
wasn't, the electronics caught it.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.839
'And again! That was a
mid-gear change slide.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.479
'That's just showing off!

41:02.480 --> 41:06.040
'Now we've got this fast right here,
down towards the follow-through.'

41:07.680 --> 41:10.279
Yeah! Whoo!

41:10.280 --> 41:13.199
'You think you're saving that, you're not.
The computer's doing it.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.359
'Through the follow-through.
That looks terrifying.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.599
'My Lord. It looks...'

41:18.600 --> 41:21.319
'You're like a sort of Scottish
Ari Vatanen, aren't you?

41:21.320 --> 41:24.399
'Now, coming hard into second
to last, does he make the apex?

41:24.400 --> 41:25.799
'He does. He clips it.'

41:25.800 --> 41:28.039
- That's so slippery, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's horrible.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.399
'Through Gambon. Nowhere
near the racing line.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.639
'And over the line.'

41:33.640 --> 41:36.039
- Thank you.
- Good effort.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.599
Honestly...

41:37.600 --> 41:40.879
Can I just say, before we go anywhere,

41:40.880 --> 41:43.919
it was so slippery out there today.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.519
- It really was treacherous.
- Yes.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.159
- But it was a lot of fun because it was.
- It was a good run.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.639
OK, new car means a new lap board.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.759
We've already had a test day
where we sent a bunch of celebs

41:53.760 --> 41:56.879
out in the GT 86 to lay down some markers.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.719
You can watch how they
did over on Extra Gear.

41:58.720 --> 42:02.479
But the fastest time so
far is one minute 39.5

42:02.480 --> 42:05.399
from Olympic double gold-winning
gymnast Max Whitlock.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.279
I loved his pommel routine,
did you ever see that?

42:08.280 --> 42:10.959
GENTLE LAUGHTER Elegant...
Anyway, all right.

42:10.960 --> 42:13.759
James, and Chris, because,
frankly, this is your fault

42:13.760 --> 42:17.279
if he doesn't go straight to the
top, you were his instructor. Right.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.359
- Feeling confident?
- Not really. A little bit...

42:20.360 --> 42:21.959
- Come on!
- Go on, show me.

42:21.960 --> 42:26.679
All right. You did it in the
wet, so it's a wet time.

42:26.680 --> 42:33.039
- One minute... 47.1.
- Yes... yes..

42:33.040 --> 42:35.919
That's not bad. That's not bad.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.279
That's not bad.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.799
- Thank you. That's not bad.
- That's awesome. Not bad at all.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.959
Right underneath Ore Oduba there.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.959
- A fine effort. - Congratulations.
- I'm the only one in the wet.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.679
That's good. That is good.

42:46.680 --> 42:47.919
Only one in the wet.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.919
I think you guys will have
a lot of fun this season

42:49.920 --> 42:51.319
with the celebrities in that car

42:51.320 --> 42:52.679
because you just can't control it

42:52.680 --> 42:54.479
like you could that Cee'd
that we both drove.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.760
- When you say "fun", do you mean death?
- Yeah!

42:57.800 --> 43:00.719
All right, James, thank you so much
for coming down and playing with us.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.999
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

43:03.000 --> 43:05.440
Thank you!

43:08.760 --> 43:13.039
Now, time to return to
our high-mile challenge.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.599
Earlier on, the three of
us each had bought a car

43:15.600 --> 43:17.719
that had driven to the moon and back.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.279
And we were crossing Kazakhstan

43:19.280 --> 43:21.360
for an appointment with the big rocket.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.559
We awoke to the chill of
another morning in Kazakhstan.

43:28.560 --> 43:32.879
And Chris noticed that
overnight I had been busy.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.559
Matt, what's going on with
the back of your car?

43:35.560 --> 43:38.879
Was it abducted last night by a
band of amateur scaffolding people?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.999
You know that the little thing you gave me

43:41.000 --> 43:43.680
that lifted the ascent of
the car up about four feet?

43:44.800 --> 43:46.959
Well, that's me being cautious

43:46.960 --> 43:50.679
and just trying to preserve the
rear end of this Mercedes.

43:50.680 --> 43:54.359
Despite the previous day's trials,
all three of our high-milers

43:54.360 --> 43:57.319
were still in the hunt for Baikonur.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.519
But since we had the place to ourselves,

43:59.520 --> 44:03.599
Rory had an idea to see whose
car was holding together best.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.359
How about a top speed challenge?

44:06.360 --> 44:09.439
But here's the twist - this
is all about reliability.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.799
So I think we should find
out whose car gets closest

44:12.800 --> 44:15.719
to their manufacturer's claimed top speed.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.359
- That sounds good.
- Chris, you're up first.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.799
And the Volvo's top speed?

44:20.800 --> 44:23.279
125mph.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.720
Three, two, one, go for it!

44:29.800 --> 44:32.440
- It's pretty aggressive.
- Yeah.

44:34.200 --> 44:37.120
That's the half a million mile
clutch he's working with.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.319
Come on, Volvo!

44:40.320 --> 44:41.879
Fourth, come on.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.359
That's 90.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.520
If Volvos are as reliable as he says
they are, this should be no problem.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.079
I'm not even 100.

44:51.080 --> 44:54.120
Not even 100, come on!

44:56.240 --> 44:58.840
- How are the kids?
- Good. Yours? - Yeah, not too bad.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.799
- All right.
- Right.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.359
- How did we do?
- I blame you for what just happened there.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.319
I've got terrible aero and no
power cos my airbox has moved

45:09.320 --> 45:14.119
because you stopped your vehicle on
the first challenge, and I hit you.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.639
- That's my fault?
- Yeah, that's your fault.

45:16.640 --> 45:20.079
- Who hit who? - Who stopped?
- Who hit who? - Who stopped?

45:20.080 --> 45:23.839
- Who hit who?
- I couldn't have hit the thing if it hadn't stopped.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.919
If there's a policeman standing
there, you'd be in trouble.

45:26.920 --> 45:28.959
Do they have policeman at race circuits?

45:28.960 --> 45:32.040
It wasn't a race circuit, we
were in a hole in the ground.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.319
Look, the news is, 104mph,

45:36.320 --> 45:39.559
which is not good enough cos
this thing should do 124, 125.

45:39.560 --> 45:43.679
So I'm 20mph back. So go and do
your worst, I'm going to lose.

45:43.680 --> 45:47.159
Next up, my European E-Class,

45:47.160 --> 45:50.679
with its 180 kilometres per hour top speed.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.000
Go!

45:55.960 --> 45:57.440
There's 100.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.520
There's 120.

46:01.880 --> 46:05.440
- Did they really invent apples in Kazakhstan?
- Yeah, apparently.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.719
I just think, if they invented the apple,

46:09.720 --> 46:12.319
then we should try an
actual Kazakhstani apple.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.679
I'd love to have an apple.

46:13.680 --> 46:16.159
155.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.879
Russet's that sort of thick-skinned,
amber-coloured apple,

46:18.880 --> 46:22.800
delicious things. The juice from
them makes a very good drink.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.079
- Come on, then, what's the number?
- Take a guess.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.719
160.

46:28.720 --> 46:32.919
Wow, on the money. - 160? - 160,
that's about 100 miles an hour.

46:32.920 --> 46:39.079
So, by getting within about 12mph
of my top speed, I had edged Chris.

46:39.080 --> 46:42.719
But I'd left the door open
for Rory's 81mph taxi.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.439
Go!

46:44.440 --> 46:47.359
- Come on, black can.
- Takes off like a shot.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.879
40.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.039
45.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.959
He was hardly the figure of
humility when he won last time,

46:53.960 --> 46:55.799
what's he going to be like this time?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.839
81mph.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.879
Yeah!

46:59.880 --> 47:00.920
Unbearable.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.399
It just gets better with time.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.359
Like a fine wine.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.399
Right, gentlemen.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.679
Give me the good news or the bad news.

47:11.680 --> 47:15.159
Well, I'm afraid it's bad news
for you, but good news for me.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.920
I managed 84mph.

47:19.160 --> 47:23.159
3mph more than the
manufacturer's quoted top speed.

47:23.160 --> 47:26.119
What? - 84mph.
- Really?

47:26.120 --> 47:29.639
- Hey, come on, you got to give it up for the taxi, right?
- Yeah.

47:29.640 --> 47:33.800
- I guess so, yeah.
- Jump back in your cars, see if you can keep up.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.360
Nice one...

47:39.760 --> 47:43.079
I didn't expect the taxi
to go faster than it did

47:43.080 --> 47:45.159
when it left the factory.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.599
That's amazing.

47:46.600 --> 47:50.239
With begrudging respect for
the black cab, we headed on.

47:50.240 --> 47:53.199
And before long, I made a discovery.

47:53.200 --> 47:57.399
Hey, there's a David Hasselhoff
cassette in the stereo.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.759
Check it out.

48:06.200 --> 48:09.200
He's been looking for freedom,
but it can't be found.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.560
But as the hours dragged on...

48:18.680 --> 48:21.440
I'm finding the flatness
quite imposing now.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.920
You wouldn't want to break
down out here, would you?

48:28.640 --> 48:31.719
We were told to head to
our last overnight stop...

48:31.720 --> 48:34.879
So that's it, that's quite
literally the end of the road.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.639
Located somewhere
within the vast emptiness

48:37.640 --> 48:40.400
that surrounded the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.559
That's a dried up salt bed.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.039
Wow!

48:50.040 --> 48:52.600
That's like Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.959
Driving on into the dark, inky gloom,

49:05.960 --> 49:09.879
eventually we arrived at our overnight stop

49:09.880 --> 49:12.680
where our final challenge awaited.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.799
- Hello.
- What does it say?

49:16.800 --> 49:20.039
It says, "Tomorrow you drive to Baikonur."

49:20.040 --> 49:23.079
"You must reach the border gate by 2pm.

49:23.080 --> 49:26.879
"At 9am tomorrow, your
mileage trips will be reset."

49:26.880 --> 49:30.759
"The winner is the high-miler
that racks up the most miles"

49:30.760 --> 49:33.079
"over the subsequent five hours."

49:33.080 --> 49:36.399
"Only the winning car
will attend the launch."

49:36.400 --> 49:39.599
"The two losing cars will be
sentenced to hard labour."

49:39.600 --> 49:40.999
All right, OK.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.279
You know what I'm going
to do when I get home?

49:46.280 --> 49:48.359
I'm going to dig out my Hoff collection.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.800
You should go to a doctor.

49:51.840 --> 49:55.240
With the rest of the night to
consider our strategies...

49:56.880 --> 49:59.920
the next morning, we awoke
to a tantalising sight.

50:04.040 --> 50:07.599
- Wow!
- Yeah, look at that!

50:07.600 --> 50:11.280
Yes, the Baikonur Cosmodrome
was almost within reach.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.279
But with our trip meters covered and reset,

50:17.280 --> 50:19.239
first there was a challenge to win.

50:19.240 --> 50:22.040
And Chris was late.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.879
What have you done?

50:28.880 --> 50:31.120
Mind your own business, Matthew.

50:32.200 --> 50:36.279
All right, all right. Most miles
when we get to Baikonur wins.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.559
Three... two...

50:38.560 --> 50:40.560
one, let's rock.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.119
If he's going to roar it,
why's he not moving?

50:45.120 --> 50:48.360
I don't know, and maybe the
taxi finally packed it in.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.919
So, clearly I'm not going to beat
those guys in a head-to-head race.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.359
I need to be smart about this challenge,

50:55.360 --> 50:58.600
and approach things with
a bit more cunning.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.999
A cagey start from the others,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.879
but my plan was simple -

51:03.880 --> 51:06.079
more speed means more miles.

51:06.080 --> 51:09.319
The easy way to make your car
quicker is to lose weight.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.799
Seats are gone,

51:10.800 --> 51:12.520
door panels gone.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.359
And I figured the best place to
take my new superlight racer

51:17.360 --> 51:19.839
was back to Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.999
Even if that did mean...

51:22.000 --> 51:25.680
another lengthy, off-road
drive to reach it.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.599
Meanwhile, in Harris's Volvo...

51:29.600 --> 51:31.719
Ha-ha, a road!

51:31.720 --> 51:33.999
Chris was heading for a nearby town

51:34.000 --> 51:36.559
with his own harebrained strategy.

51:36.560 --> 51:40.359
Speed is in the mind, so
to change my mind-set,

51:40.360 --> 51:44.080
I've invoked Volvo's racing history here.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.399
You remember?

51:47.400 --> 51:50.519
The year was 1994 and
British touring car legend

51:50.520 --> 51:53.840
Rickard Rydell debuted
the Volvo 850 Estate.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.320
Surely the coolest estate car ever.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.759
Add to that a... perfectly
safe range-extending fuel tank

52:05.760 --> 52:08.439
and you have the ultimate
high-mileage maker.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.159
I just needed somewhere to use it.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.039
So, I did a bit of research last night.

52:12.040 --> 52:15.799
There is an airfield near here,
I don't quite know where,

52:15.800 --> 52:17.519
but I know it's nearby.

52:17.520 --> 52:21.279
The second thing I did last night
was to learn a Russian phrase.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.959
"Where's the airfield?"

52:22.960 --> 52:24.920
Here we are, I'll ask this woman here.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.559
No, she didn't want to know.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.559
She didn't want to...

52:32.560 --> 52:35.679
'Now, while the others wasted valuable time

52:35.680 --> 52:38.319
'finding places they could up the pace...'

52:38.320 --> 52:39.800
Into gear.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.639
Now for some revs.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.040
'..I opted for a short cut.'

52:48.760 --> 52:50.919
Right, this is it.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.400
Let the high mileage begin.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.040
Woohoo!

53:01.680 --> 53:03.479
No, that's not happening.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.640
Though I swear I heard one of them
say, "Is that Rickard Rydell?"

53:20.080 --> 53:21.879
That was it.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.960
We're on. This direction.

53:26.760 --> 53:28.680
Woohoo!

53:30.240 --> 53:33.279
Now, this is what I call easy miles.

53:33.280 --> 53:36.280
Nice and soft terrain,
not too hard on the car.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.760
What the hell was that?

53:45.200 --> 53:46.959
Something's come wildly loose,

53:46.960 --> 53:49.759
I don't know if it's that
bar on the back or what.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.039
In fact, it was worse.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.839
And with no time to lose,

53:53.840 --> 53:57.120
the Mercedes needed the delicate
touch of a professional.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.760
Saved a little more weight.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.680
After a slow start over in the Volvo...

54:22.880 --> 54:26.680
Rickard Rydell had
finally found his airfield.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.800
100 miles an hour.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.440
What a place!

54:37.320 --> 54:39.079
High banking at Daytona.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.719
I really like this car.

54:40.720 --> 54:44.359
She may be old, she may be almost worn out,

54:44.360 --> 54:46.879
but she's got heart, she really does.

54:46.880 --> 54:51.039
'After three hours of flat-out,
lightweight racing though...'

54:51.040 --> 54:53.199
A fuel light just came on.

54:53.200 --> 54:56.399
'..It was time to start
the long drive back.'

54:56.400 --> 54:58.400
OK, Baikonur!

55:00.720 --> 55:04.600
Now, Rory was also running low on
fuel, but he had thought ahead.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.360
Ouch!

55:15.680 --> 55:17.520
No!

55:22.680 --> 55:24.200
That is dead.

55:27.480 --> 55:30.520
That's dead, isn't it?
That's definitely dead.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.719
Man!

55:34.720 --> 55:40.000
Back in my range-extended Volvo,
things were looking tasty.

55:41.320 --> 55:44.319
I'm averaging a lot of miles an hour here.

55:44.320 --> 55:46.120
A lot of miles an hour.

55:47.440 --> 55:50.279
And while I was piling
on the miles, Matt...

55:50.280 --> 55:51.679
wasn't.

55:51.680 --> 55:54.280
All right, finally a
little bit of smooth road.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.159
Spoke too soon.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.840
But then, somehow...

56:03.560 --> 56:05.160
the cab was back.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.640
How is this car still running?
Unbelievable!

56:13.160 --> 56:14.760
I love this car.

56:15.960 --> 56:18.279
We're a team.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.560
Whatever happens, we're a team.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.919
'And at last...'

56:23.920 --> 56:25.799
This is it, this is it.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.799
'..This team reached the
entrance to the Cosmodrome.'

56:28.800 --> 56:30.199
I'm the first one here,

56:30.200 --> 56:34.639
so I may as well do a few of my
legendary tiny turning circles.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.960
Every mile counts. Every mile counts.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.199
And with just a few minutes left...

56:42.200 --> 56:44.519
Hey, there you are!

56:44.520 --> 56:48.319
It was a desperate
fight to add distance.

56:48.320 --> 56:52.000
I can add some miles too, man,
two can play at that game.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.400
Where's Harris?

57:03.760 --> 57:08.720
Rory, Rory, that's it. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock, the party is over.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.319
How's your head? Dizzy?

57:13.320 --> 57:14.360
Dizzy.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.119
That is becoming his signature look.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.320
Maybe he can't see where he's going.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.839
- Gentlemen.
- How did you do?

57:24.840 --> 57:29.479
- Well, quietly confident, but let's see what happens.
- Who's this?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.960
He must be checking the mileage.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.280
He's got a lovely wrist
action on that ratchet.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.520
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- OK, Matt.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.159
OK, I have here the results.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.559
In third place, with 211 miles...

57:50.560 --> 57:52.199
Mr Chris Harris.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.440
Congratulations.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.840
In second place, with 284 miles...

58:03.080 --> 58:06.639
- Mr Matt LeBlanc.
- Come on!

58:06.640 --> 58:09.519
- That's right.
- Say it, say it.

58:09.520 --> 58:16.240
In first place, with 329 miles,
Mr Rory Reid in the black taxi.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.680
Way to go, man.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.360
Hang on, hang on, look at this.

58:24.920 --> 58:28.360
Really? Is that what's happening?

58:29.520 --> 58:31.120
The losers lose their cars.

58:33.360 --> 58:34.919
'So we had our winner.

58:34.920 --> 58:38.359
'And as the others set off
toward their new life of service

58:38.360 --> 58:40.159
'on the Kazakh Steppe...'

58:40.160 --> 58:43.759
I'd become rather fond of my Volvo, Matt.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.399
Yeah, I'm going to miss that old car.

58:46.400 --> 58:50.879
'The truth is, all our high-milers
had proven their worth.

58:50.880 --> 58:54.439
'And now, all that remained
were the last few miles

58:54.440 --> 58:57.719
'into the heart of the
Cosmodrome and the launch site.

58:57.720 --> 59:00.559
'This would be the black
cab's victory lap.'

59:00.560 --> 59:03.400
- Where you headed?
- Rocket launch? - Jump in.

59:04.920 --> 59:08.039
And it gave us a chance
to consider something.

59:08.040 --> 59:12.640
You see, to most people, cars
are just a tool, a runaround.

59:13.680 --> 59:17.319
You might run one for 60, 70,

59:17.320 --> 59:20.439
even 100,000 miles and
think it's had its day.

59:20.440 --> 59:24.959
But the truth is, it
could do so much more.'

59:24.960 --> 59:28.679
Back in the '50s, the US and
Soviet Union's fierce battle

59:28.680 --> 59:33.160
for global engineering dominance
propelled mankind into space.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.479
The Cold War thawed just for a moment

59:37.480 --> 59:42.919
as the world stood in collective
wonder at what we could achieve.

59:42.920 --> 59:46.359
It was an event that marked one
of the most intense periods

59:46.360 --> 59:49.359
of technological development
in human history -

59:49.360 --> 59:53.039
and it brought us to
today, where right now,

59:53.040 --> 59:56.919
sat on your driveway, you could have a car,

59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.119
a car, that's been so well engineered,

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.880
it'll go the distance to the
moon and back, and beyond.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.920
Wow!

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.600
I still can't get that
Hasselhoff song out of my head.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.959
Amazing cars, indestructible.
Indestructible.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.039
OK, so, Rory, we know why
our cars aren't here,

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.199
they're doing hard labour in Kazakhstan.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.999
But where's your little black cab,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.839
did you not want to drive it back
the 3,000 miles from Baikonur?

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.999
I'd have loved to have driven my taxi home,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.159
but it had a higher calling, a public duty.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.719
Check this out.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.920
See that?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.319
That's been immortalised, OK?
It's a symbol of hope.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.119
Yeah, you know, that was really nice.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.479
The good men and women of Baikonur,

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.999
they can look up at your humble taxi,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.079
symbol of Britain, of London,

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.799
and think, thank God I don't
have to drive one of those.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.439
Don't hate a winner, Matt.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.919
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance.
- No dancing.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.159
OK, next week, convertible
supercars in the USA,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.759
the Alfa Romeo Giulia and
one very broken windscreen.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.359
- Thanks for watching.
- Yeah, we'll see you all next week.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.560
Goodnight.
