00:12.179 --> 00:15.265
So you wanna go with Eep to a slime cave?

00:15.265 --> 00:18.435
‐ Yeah. It's supposed to be
slimy and wet and stinky.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.436
I can't wait!

00:19.436 --> 00:21.730
‐ Dawn, you're not a cave girl.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.898
We're evolved.

00:22.898 --> 00:25.984
And we don't visit slime caves
or talk with our mouths full.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.654
And we don't reach for food
when we're eating a meal

00:28.654 --> 00:30.197
like human beings!

00:40.707 --> 00:41.542
Phil!

01:19.705 --> 01:20.706
‐ Crowverine?

01:20.706 --> 01:21.540
Ha!

01:21.540 --> 01:23.584
Try no‐verine.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.962
Not today, wolfspider.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.256
I don't have as many eyes as you,
but I have‐‐

01:30.090 --> 01:31.592
Sandy!

01:31.592 --> 01:32.843
Thanks, Sandy.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.389
Oh. Hope.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.140
You're lucky.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.017
For a second, I thought
you were a bearacuda.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.894
‐ Do I look like a bearacuda?

01:41.894 --> 01:44.021
‐ How was the crowverine that time?
Fast enough for you?

01:44.021 --> 01:44.980
‐ Perfect, Guy.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.107
You've really outdone yourself
with this invention.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.151
Hey, Hope, you wanna try
Guy's new survival course?

01:49.151 --> 01:51.236
‐ I can set it to easy mode
since it's your first time.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.613
‐ No.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.698
I wanna talk to Ugga about Sandy.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.909
She and that, whatever Douglas is,

01:56.909 --> 01:59.244
were running wild
and ruined breakfast.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.245
And my flowers.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.580
‐ Oh. Then I'll just‐‐

02:01.580 --> 02:02.581
Sorry about the flowers.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.416
But she wasn't running wild.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.377
She was practicing
her survival skills with Douglas.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.671
You never know
when a wild animal might attack.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.423
Um‐‐

02:13.300 --> 02:14.468
‐ Right.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.387
But she doesn't have to worry
about animal attacks anymore.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.806
Because she lives here, on the farm.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.976
So it might be time
for her to start evolving?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.645
‐ Oh, yeah, I'm definitely gonna, um‐‐

02:24.645 --> 02:26.230
‐ Are you telling me how to raise my kid?

02:26.230 --> 02:27.022
‐ Oh, no.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.982
‐ What?

02:28.982 --> 02:31.151
No. I would never.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.613
But, if you'd like,
I can give Sandy some tips.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.281
Look how I've helped Dawn evolve.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.367
Dawn, you'll get a peel cut.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.451
‐ Seriously, Mom?

02:39.451 --> 02:40.911
‐ You know the banana rules.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.747
You're right. My banana bad.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.582
‐ Smaller bites.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.127
And chew and chew and chew
and swallow.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.003
‐ Mom!

02:50.003 --> 02:52.381
‐ Dawn, there's banana in your mouth.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.257
Banana bad.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.301
Now go take a post‐banana shower
and put on a clean robe.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.637
See? Evolved.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.265
And, with my help, Sandy can be too.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.391
Think about it.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.396
‐ Why didn't I leave so much earlier?

03:07.396 --> 03:08.689
‐ Guy? Could I have a word?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.817
‐ Yes! Yes! All the words. All of them.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.862
‐ Guy, today is your lucky day.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.739
I'm going to invent
a revolutionary innovation,

03:17.739 --> 03:19.366
dining without reaching.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.576
Because Hope told me to.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.952
And I need your help.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.079
‐ So, you saw my survival course.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.080
Pretty great, huh?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.708
‐ I'm sure your rudimentary tinkering

03:27.708 --> 03:30.169
was received with great wonderment
by the Croods.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.296
But I am a Betterman.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.631
And this is civilization, Guy,

03:34.631 --> 03:36.300
not the primordial ooze.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.467
‐ I've got it! What if you just‐‐

03:37.467 --> 03:38.385
Shh!

03:38.385 --> 03:40.804
No time for your amateur pondering.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.930
‐ Then what do you need me for?

03:41.930 --> 03:45.976
‐ I need a test subject
and your head will fit the helmet.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.688
Can you make your head smaller?

03:50.856 --> 03:51.607
Let's go, Dawn.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.775
Before the slime
in the slime cave gets too slimy.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.404
‐ Hey, Eep!

03:57.404 --> 03:59.615
‐ You're being eaten by a moss monster!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.243
‐ It's not a moss monster.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.494
It's my Progress Pod.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.996
My mom gave it to me when I was little

04:05.996 --> 04:10.042
to help me "evolve and realize
my full human potential."

04:10.042 --> 04:11.418
Her words, not mine.

04:11.418 --> 04:15.172
It protects me from everything
by stopping me from doing anything.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.216
‐ Oh. My mom gave me that ax.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.718
‐ But now I just like hanging out in here.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.763
It is so soft.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.181
‐ Did you seriously not feel the ax?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.599
I threw it really hard.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.183
‐ Nope.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.185
Mom was also worried
about me getting dirty and hurty,

04:28.185 --> 04:29.603
so it's extra sturdy.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.063
Again, her words.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.316
‐ Do you feel... this?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.318
‐ Nothing.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.486
‐ Wanna see what else you can't feel?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.404
‐ Ooh, I sure do.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.906
‐ Then let's tuck and roll, baby.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.410
‐ Breathe in the light,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.371
breathe out the light.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.790
Breathe in the light‐‐

04:51.041 --> 04:54.002
Ugh. Why does the light
smell like a dead crowverine?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.966
Sorry, Sandy, you just startled me.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.095
Are you looking for your Mom?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.304
‐ Nuh‐uh.

05:04.304 --> 05:04.888
‐ Food?

05:04.888 --> 05:05.889
‐ Nuh‐uh.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.349
‐ Do you wanna know what I'm doing?

05:08.559 --> 05:10.060
It's called yoga.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.355
It's great for relieving tension
and calming your mind.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.982
And not scratching.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.526
It's something you do when you're evolved.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.194
Would you like to evolve?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.535
‐ Oh. Huh.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.078
‐ Wonderful!

05:28.078 --> 05:30.789
And when we're done,
you'll be a whole new girl.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.748
Ugh!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.292
Ugh.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.085
Mostly.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.593
Mm‐mmm.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.973
‐ Huh?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.392
‐ Ooh.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.398
Huh?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.151
‐ Huh?

06:02.779 --> 06:03.697
‐ Mm‐hmm.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.704
Mm‐hmm.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.627
Oh

06:19.963 --> 06:23.425
‐ Ready to realize your potential
with a little chicken seal bowling?

06:23.425 --> 06:25.344
‐ I've never been more ready.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.638
How many do you think we can get?
Half of 'em?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.348
‐ Oh, no.
You have more potential than that.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.849
‐ You sound like my mom.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.100
But you're right.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.519
It's all or nothing.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.521
Now let's bowl!

06:37.856 --> 06:39.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:42.194 --> 06:43.737
‐ Cock‐a‐doodle‐down.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.746
‐ Hey, Hope. I felt bad about the flowers
so I got you some more.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.831
‐ Great. You can put them next to Sandy.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.500
Doesn't she look amazing?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.585
And just wait till you see her use a fork.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.337
So evolved.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.214
‐ I can't believe you did this.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.259
‐ You don't have to thank me.
Mothering is my pleasure.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.720
‐ Wait, so, first my kids need to evolve
and now I'm a bad mom?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.055
‐ Your words, not mine.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.390
‐ Hmm. Will you excuse me?

07:12.933 --> 07:16.228
Ha!

07:25.237 --> 07:26.530
I'm sorry. You were saying?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.448
‐ Uh... is something wrong?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.366
‐ Oh, you tell me.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.160
You took my daughter
and turned her into some kind of mini you.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.620
‐ She came to me for help.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.539
‐ She doesn't need help.
And she doesn't need to evolve.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.541
She's been surviving in the wild
since birth.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.750
This isn't the wild.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.877
This is a farm.

07:39.877 --> 07:40.544
‐ Do me a favor.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.504
Instead of trying to fix my children,
fix your own.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.132
‐ How could I fix Dawn? She's perfect.

07:45.132 --> 07:45.799
‐ Is she?

07:45.799 --> 07:48.886
What happens when you're not there
to peel her banana?

07:48.886 --> 07:50.637
Or chew her banana?

07:50.637 --> 07:53.140
Or deal with non‐banana problems?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.475
Sandy, we're leaving. Lose the dress.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.816
‐ But you didn't see her use a fork.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.569
You can see it later.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.867
‐ So, about my idea to stop people
from reaching across the table,

08:11.867 --> 08:13.827
I actually drew a sketch of it and‐‐

08:13.827 --> 08:16.788
‐ Irrelevant.
Because I have forged a solution.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.789
Reach for the bowl.

08:20.918 --> 08:21.418
‐ Holy‐‐

08:21.418 --> 08:22.211
Wha‐‐

08:22.211 --> 08:23.045
Wh‐‐

08:23.045 --> 08:24.254
Why‐‐ Was that a misfire?

08:24.254 --> 08:25.923
‐ No. But, upon review,

08:25.923 --> 08:28.509
perhaps a slightly less severe approach
is in order.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.599
‐ Call me... a bad... mother.

08:36.141 --> 08:39.269
I'd like to see
Hope mother three kids in the wild.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.563
You know, there's no peel cuts

08:41.563 --> 08:44.942
and chew‐chew‐chew
and flowers in your hair.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.569
It's eat or be eaten.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.905
And don't even get me started
on volcanoes.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.865
Don't worry, Sandy.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.493
I won't let Hope try to turn you
into something that you're not.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.498
Ugh. Or am I holding on to the past?

09:00.332 --> 09:02.876
Maybe survival
isn't all that matters anymore.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.961
Whoa!

09:07.798 --> 09:08.882
Ah.
‐ Ah.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.970
‐ Or maybe I need to teach Hope
a little something about survival.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.637
‐ Ah.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.472
‐ Hey, Hope.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.640
Stay back!

09:18.225 --> 09:19.184
Ehh.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.436
Stay back or I'll use these.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.272
‐ To make me sneeze?

09:23.272 --> 09:24.898
‐ Yes. Good idea.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.608
‐ Hope, I'm here to apologize.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.985
‐ I was just trying to help‐‐

09:27.985 --> 09:29.403
Wait, apologize?

09:29.403 --> 09:32.364
I mean, yes. As you should.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.031
For what again?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.033
‐ For coming in so hot.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.994
I'm sorry. You were just trying to help.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.912
‐ Thank you, Ugga.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.998
And I'm impressed.

09:40.998 --> 09:43.876
You probably didn't do a whole lot
of apologizing out in the wild.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.420
‐ True, but that's because
I'm always right.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.964
The point is,
we're not in the wild anymore.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.049
I can learn from you. So can my kids.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.634
‐ Exactly.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.971
I'm a resource. Use me.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.056
‐ I was hoping you'd say that.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.101
Because I'd like you to help me again.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.061
‐ With Eep? Yeah.

10:03.061 --> 10:03.812
My pleasure.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.314
She's so smart and‐‐

10:05.314 --> 10:06.523
‐ Not Eep.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.942
‐ Sandy again? Of course.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.986
We were really starting
to make some progress

10:10.986 --> 10:12.112
before you almost killed me.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.238
‐ Not Sandy.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.282
‐ Hey, uh, the water in the outhouse,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.075
heh, it's okay to drink, right?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.622
‐ Oh! Thunk.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.497
Of course.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.375
Yeah, I'd be happy... to‐to help him.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.836
In fact, he'll be a changed man by dinner.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.632
‐ Oh, dinner?
Great, because I am starving.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.427
‐ Ugh.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.474
How many points for hitting a bounceberry?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.017
‐ Bounceberries are ten points.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.393
Dragumberries are 20.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.229
And, if you hit Gran, it's 100.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.063
‐ Get to it.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.065
‐ Oh. And Gran's okay with this?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.066
‐ Oh, yeah. It was her idea.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.901
‐ What are you waiting for?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.528
Take your best drop.

10:52.528 --> 10:54.404
‐ Ha, ha. Pods away!

10:58.283 --> 11:01.036
‐ Ha. You're way off.
Not even close‐‐

11:03.872 --> 11:05.040
Is that all you've got?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.584
I've been hit harder by rain.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.049
‐ Hello, Thunk. Watching window, I see.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.970
‐ Yeah. Right now I'm watching a cloud
that looks like another cloud.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.721
It's hilarious.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.765
‐ Oh, that's... a thing.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.809
So what did you do
before you watched window?

11:23.809 --> 11:27.145
‐ Eh, I just sat in the cave
and stared at the wall.

11:27.813 --> 11:29.022
It was a different world.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.985
‐ Don't remind me. Caves are the worst.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.194
That's why we built the farm.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.114
And things are very different here.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.992
So your mom asked me
to help you evolve into a‐‐

11:39.992 --> 11:41.660
‐ Gah! Foot itch.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.829
Good thing I found
this foot scratcher though.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.039
‐ Not a foot scratcher!
It's my hair brush.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.957
Ugh.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.417
If you're going to evolve,

11:48.417 --> 11:50.627
you have to learn
how to take care of yourself,

11:50.627 --> 11:52.713
your home, the people you live with.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.047
How does that sound?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.883
‐ Sounds great. Let me know if I can help.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.178
‐ Well, you can start
by getting off the couch.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.138
‐ Sounds great. Let me know if I can help.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.890
‐ You can. By getting off the couch.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.765
Are you listening to me?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.976
‐ Sounds great. Let me know if I can help.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.770
‐ Okay, Hope, find your peace.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.647
You've raised a daughter. And a Phil.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.107
You can do this.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.401
‐ Ooh, a leg ride.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.696
‐ If you'd just let me show you my idea.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.740
In fact, I built a prototype.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.366
‐ Good one, Guy.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.161
Now, steady yourself while I take aim.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.789
Little to the left,
allowing for cave wind resistance,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.499
and... done.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.460
Are you ready to make history, Guy?

12:31.460 --> 12:34.254
‐ Phil, you and I both know the fruit
is just gonna hit me in the‐‐

12:35.506 --> 12:36.798
face. See?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.509
‐ Yes, I do see.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.010
I'm getting warmer!

12:43.138 --> 12:45.557
‐ Cleaning up your home
is one critical thing

12:45.557 --> 12:48.393
that separates humans from wild animals.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.730
‐ You might wanna tell that
to whoever left all this garbage here.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.397
Can I go now?

12:52.397 --> 12:53.732
‐ You left it here.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.025
This is your garbage.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.902
‐ I'm glad we cleared that up.
Can I go now?

12:56.902 --> 12:59.530
‐ No. Because you're going to clean it up.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.030
‐ Why?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.241
‐ Because you're not an animal!

13:03.742 --> 13:05.827
And I'll give you a banana if you do.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.913
Just be careful of peel cuts.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.623
‐ Oh, heh, I don't peel 'em.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.376
Can I go now?

13:12.376 --> 13:14.211
‐ No! You have to clean up the garbage.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.212
‐ Sure thing.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.422
If you give me a banana.

13:18.966 --> 13:19.883
‐ Ugh!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.513
‐ Hey, I know this place.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.681
‐ Right. It's my room.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.641
‐ No, no. It's where I take a nap.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.851
See? That's my pillow.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.894
‐ No, that's my pillow.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.271
Those are my clothes.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.232
And those are pictures of my family
hanging on the wall.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.608
‐ Oh, yeah. Look at that.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.776
It's you.

13:37.776 --> 13:41.613
‐ Right. Because this is my room
and your room is your room.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.656
Does that make sense?

13:42.656 --> 13:43.740
‐ You know what it is?

13:43.740 --> 13:48.161
I lived in a cave for so long,
all rooms kinda look the same.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.372
Ha! I guess I'm just room blind.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.666
‐ I want you to stay out of my room.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.918
‐ You got it. Right after I take a nap.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
Could you close the blinds?

14:00.340 --> 14:04.761
‐ Taking care of yourself
is the easiest part of being evolved.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.930
That's why you're taking a shower.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.975
Remember, wash your entire body.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.144
And here's the key, use the soap.

14:12.144 --> 14:15.689
That's the thing I handed you
when I said, "This is soap."

14:15.689 --> 14:16.565
Is that clear?

14:16.565 --> 14:18.025
‐ Uh, is what clear?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.943
‐ Thunk!
What are you doing out here?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.653
You're supposed to be taking a shower.

14:21.653 --> 14:25.282
‐ Oh. That's what you meant when you said,
"Thunk, take a shower"?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.492
‐ What else would I have meant?

14:27.492 --> 14:28.744
And how did you get out here?

14:28.744 --> 14:30.287
I've been standing here the whole time.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.498
‐ Don't ask the question
if you don't want the answer.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.002
‐ I do want the answer.
That's why I asked the question. Ugh!

14:37.002 --> 14:39.379
I don't understand why this is so hard.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.674
I just want you to take a shower
so you'll look nice for dinner.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.926
‐ Okay.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.052
‐ Really?
‐ Sure.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.138
‐ Okay. That's progress. Thank you.

14:48.138 --> 14:48.805
‐ No problem.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.517
So, should I shower
before dinner or after?

14:51.517 --> 14:52.601
‐ Before!

14:52.601 --> 14:53.685
‐ Got it.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.979
‐ The shower is right here.

14:55.979 --> 14:56.772
Ugh!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.775
This is the best!

14:59.775 --> 15:01.443
‐ But it could be better.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.362
‐ What? What's better than the best?

15:03.362 --> 15:05.072
‐ Progress Pod for two.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.490
You think there's room in there
for both of us?

15:06.490 --> 15:09.409
‐ Only one way to find out.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.420
Whoa!

15:20.420 --> 15:22.297
Who‐o‐oa!

15:27.511 --> 15:29.054
Whoa!

15:30.639 --> 15:32.724
‐ These ants haven't
moved the bowl at all.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.393
I'll have to start over with new ants.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.062
‐ Or you could finally listen to my idea.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.730
‐ Ugh.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.816
Very well. Be quick about it.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.032
‐ Okay, what if you put the food
on this round board and make it go round?

15:49.032 --> 15:50.158
Like this.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.122
See? No more reaching.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.958
How? Th‐‐ It wasn't even loaded.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.959
‐ Genius.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.045
‐ Oh, thanks.
You know, I have another idea‐‐

16:02.045 --> 16:04.256
‐ No, no. I mean I'm a genius.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.009
And I'll call it
the Betterman Dinner Go Round.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.011
‐ But it was my idea.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.186
‐ Guy, why are you wearing a helmet?

16:17.186 --> 16:19.354
‐ Because I can't take it off. It's stuck.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.149
‐ Well, we'll wait
until everyone's here to start dinner.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.068
But, while we're waiting, you may nibble
on these roasted mangotatoes.

16:25.068 --> 16:25.903
‐ Ooh. Outta my way.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.154
‐ Grug. No reaching.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.616
‐ But the mangotatoes are over there
and I'm over here.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.201
Reaching is the only way.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.368
Wrong again, Grug.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.580
Reaching was the only way until now.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.415
Because instead of reaching,

16:38.415 --> 16:41.502
you can use
the Betterman Dinner Go Round.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.713
And... voila!

16:47.633 --> 16:49.301
‐ Eh, not for me.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.761
But the Dinner Go Round?

16:50.761 --> 16:53.889
I hate to say it, Phil,
but this is a great idea.

16:54.473 --> 16:55.432
‐ Yeah.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.185
It is a great idea.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.187
Whoops.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.230
‐ Don't feel bad, Guy.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.149
You'll have a good idea
like this someday. Probably.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.692
‐ How'd it go with Thunk, Hope?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.110
‐ Piece of cake.
‐ Piece of cake?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.071
Courtesy of the Dinner Go Round.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.030
My idea, of course.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.824
‐ So where is this evolved Thunk?

17:12.824 --> 17:15.577
Is he leading
a roundtable discussion on fire?

17:15.577 --> 17:18.664
‐ Oh, he probably just wants
to look his best.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.207
I'll go check on him.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.669
Thunk! What are you doing?

17:23.669 --> 17:24.837
Why aren't you at dinner?

17:24.837 --> 17:27.005
Everyone is waiting to see
the evolved you.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.174
‐ Sounds great. Let me know if I can help.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.385
‐ The least you could do is
put this clean robe on.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.346
I can't tell where the peels end
and the you begins.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.474
‐ Clean robe? Sorry. I don't do clean.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.017
Or robe.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.811
Or putting on.

17:40.811 --> 17:43.522
Plus, things are
really getting good with leaf.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.316
‐ If you don't put it on,
I will put it on you!

17:48.443 --> 17:52.030
‐ Okay. If it's that important to you,
I'll wear the robe.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.116
‐ It is. Thank you.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.577
‐ My pleasure. Least I can do.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.912
‐ Okay, then. Good talk.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.748
I'll leave this here
and see you shortly.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.377
Yes! There's no escaping Hope.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.634
‐ Where are we?

18:14.720 --> 18:15.721
‐ On top of a mountain.

18:15.721 --> 18:18.223
It doesn't get more
reaching your potential than this.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.059
‐ I'm not sure
this is what my mom had in mind.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.729
She wants me evolving, not revolving.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.147
‐ Yeah, what's her deal?

18:25.147 --> 18:27.191
Why is evolving so important to her?

18:27.191 --> 18:29.693
‐ Who knows? She wasn't always like this.

18:29.693 --> 18:33.530
She never cared about rules
or soap or forks before we built the farm.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.698
‐ So why do you care?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.408
‐ About doing what she wants me to do?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.327
She's my mom.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.787
‐ Yeah. Moms are always right.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.747
Even when they're wrong.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.248
Oh. The sun's setting.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.333
And I can't be late for dinner.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.918
Only animals are late for dinner.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.461
My mom's words, not mine.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.337
‐ We're not gonna be late.

18:48.337 --> 18:50.380
Because it's all downhill from here.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.515
‐ Can we eat now?

18:59.515 --> 19:02.017
‐ No. We have to wait
until everyone is seated.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.101
Hope's words, not mine.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.353
‐ Hmm.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.649
‐ Grug, stop making
the Dinner Go Round go round.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.651
‐ If I can't eat, I'm gonna go round.

19:10.651 --> 19:13.820
‐ Thunk will be here soon.
He wanted to make an entrance.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.155
‐ Hey, what's for dinner?

19:16.448 --> 19:18.116
‐ Thunk, where's your robe?

19:18.116 --> 19:19.117
‐ What robe?

19:19.117 --> 19:19.910
‐ What?

19:19.910 --> 19:23.163
The robe I just gave you
that you said you were gonna put on.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.373
‐ I did?

19:24.373 --> 19:25.958
Are you sure that was me?

19:34.591 --> 19:36.134
Why am I not going anywhere?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.262
‐ Because you're on
the Betterman Dinner Go Round.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.179
My idea.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.014
‐ Was it, Phil? Was it really?

19:41.014 --> 19:42.558
‐ Having trouble with Thunk?

19:42.558 --> 19:44.184
‐ What? Trouble?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.228
No.

19:46.228 --> 19:49.857
He's just performing the, um,
dinner show we rehearsed.

19:49.857 --> 19:50.774
‐ No, he's not!

19:50.774 --> 19:53.443
‐ Thunk, stop going round
and get down here.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.945
‐ I can't. I'm too dizzy.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.491
‐ I guess the lesson here is

19:59.950 --> 20:02.035
evolving isn't more important
than surviving.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.162
‐ Are you kidding me? Wrong!

20:04.162 --> 20:06.081
Everyone here needs to evolve.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.125
That's why we have rules and plates and‐‐
‐ Huh?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.422
‐ The Progress Pod!

20:14.381 --> 20:16.341
Why didn't we make it a Progress Cube?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.302
Dawn, are you in there?

20:18.969 --> 20:20.512
Or a Progress Pyramid?

20:20.512 --> 20:23.390
Or a Progress anything‐that‐doesn't‐roll?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.267
Dawn, answer me!

20:27.936 --> 20:29.271
Dawn!

20:29.271 --> 20:30.439
‐ Was that my mom?

20:30.439 --> 20:32.482
‐ Uh, nah, that was a chicken seal.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.068
Ugh! Nothing is going my way today.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.112
Even the Progress Pod turned on me.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.489
And how is it rolling uphill?

20:43.452 --> 20:45.329
I think I finally lost it.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.955
‐ Lost what? What is that thing?

20:46.955 --> 20:48.999
‐ It's Dawn's Progress Pod.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.543
I had Phil make it to help Dawn evolve.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.421
‐ Yes, it's a safe, quiet place
to reflect and‐‐

20:54.421 --> 20:56.340
Grug, are you eating the cake?

20:57.549 --> 20:58.467
‐ What cake?

20:58.467 --> 20:59.968
Woo‐hoo!

20:59.968 --> 21:00.677
Oh, no!

21:00.677 --> 21:02.012
It found me!

21:10.395 --> 21:12.231
‐ See? I told you we'd make it.

21:12.231 --> 21:14.024
‐ Hi, Mom. What's for dinner?

21:14.024 --> 21:15.859
‐ Whatever you can find on the floor.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.365
Thanks for the save, Sandy.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.118
You knew Thunk wouldn't listen to me,
didn't you?

21:25.118 --> 21:25.827
‐ I sure did.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.162
‐ So you were teaching me a lesson?

21:27.162 --> 21:29.623
‐ Yes, mind your own mom business.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.708
Because survival is important.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.753
I mean, the only reason you're here
and not under that moss ball

21:34.753 --> 21:36.255
is Sandy knows how to survive.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.006
‐ I know survival's important.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.050
But I hate it.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.636
All the running
and the trying not to be killed.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.137
And the dirt‐‐ Ugh!

21:44.137 --> 21:45.597
So much dirt.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.350
Phil and I built this farm
to put that life behind us.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.935
I never wanna go back.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.603
The thought of it wakes me up at night.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.896
Screaming.

21:53.605 --> 21:54.898
‐ I thought that was you.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.651
‐ But you were right.
Evolving isn't for everyone.

21:57.651 --> 21:58.360
‐ Sure it is.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.113
But some of us just evolve
more slowly than others.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.741
‐ Go, go round faster. Faster.

22:04.741 --> 22:05.617
Whoa!

22:07.035 --> 22:08.495
‐ So we're both right.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.497
‐ Yup. Because moms are never wrong.

22:11.582 --> 22:13.834
It's not all bad.
You got Thunk off the couch.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.711
‐ And I taught Sandy
how to eat with a fork.

22:15.711 --> 22:18.088
‐ Actually, she's using it as a weapon.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.427
‐ So how should we
get this thing out of here?

22:25.846 --> 22:26.889
‐ Huh.

22:26.889 --> 22:29.141
Think there's enough room in there
for the two of us?

22:29.141 --> 22:31.018
‐ Only one way to find out.
