WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:04.203
(upbeat christmas music)

00:26.460 --> 00:27.693
- oh yes. Great.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.628
Those will go in the
dining room. Thank you.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.532
(movers chattering)

00:33.567 --> 00:34.400
hm.

00:41.776 --> 00:42.908
(bells chiming)

00:42.943 --> 00:45.577
- at upstage we need to
accentuate the selling points

00:45.613 --> 00:48.347
of the home to entice the
widest array of buyers.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.283
We're the last stage you'll
have before selling your home.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.352
This is grace ryan,
my partner in design

00:53.387 --> 00:55.354
and the other half of upstaged.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.056
- Nice to meet you.

00:57.091 --> 01:00.025
I hope you're okay we moved
the paola buffa side table.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.061
It was hidden in that guest
room and we really thought it

01:02.096 --> 01:05.064
would bring the dining
room that wow-factor.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.899
- The buffa what?

01:06.934 --> 01:10.569
- The walnut side table
handmade by one of the premier

01:10.604 --> 01:13.272
european furniture makers
of the 20th century.

01:16.811 --> 01:17.943
The brown table with
the ridged drawers

01:17.978 --> 01:19.178
and the brass handles.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.247
- Oh that. I mostly keep my
workout clothes on it anyway.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.250
- Oh, you keep your workout
clothes on a paola buffa.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.552
- Well the treadmills
in there, ha,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.887
never liked the look
of it, to be honest.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.823
- Can you excuse us
for just a moment?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.724
Take a look around and let
me know how you like the rest

01:32.760 --> 01:33.625
of the house.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.832
Putting the buffa on the
dining room was a bold choice.

01:39.867 --> 01:43.902
Now that is see it, it's
a little loud, isn't it?

01:43.938 --> 01:46.772
- I thought it gave the
room a pop of style.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.074
- Perhaps it's more
like an explosion.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.242
- Right.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.076
- We want people
talking about the room,

01:51.112 --> 01:52.077
not the table, right?

01:52.113 --> 01:53.979
- Yes. I will get them
over to switch it out.

01:54.014 --> 01:54.980
- And while they're at it,

01:55.049 --> 01:57.349
let's ask them to switch
the artwork in the den.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.283
- Oh, really?

01:58.319 --> 02:01.086
I was really digging
those old french adverts

02:01.122 --> 02:02.621
that fit in there.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.456
- You don't think it looks
a little too nineties?

02:06.026 --> 02:09.027
I almost forgot, the
producers called.

02:09.063 --> 02:10.829
- Really? What,
what did they say?

02:10.865 --> 02:12.598
- They want to sit with
us after the holidays,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.534
talking through our vision
for a home staging show.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.035
- That's amazing.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.037
- Said we make a dynamic duo.

02:19.073 --> 02:22.040
This could be huge for
us, for our company.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.610
Our own tv show,
grace. Think about it.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.279
Listen, I'll finish up here.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.348
I'm sure your family's
eager to have you at home.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.048
- Are you sure?

02:30.084 --> 02:33.018
- Definitely. Go, I got this.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.289
Actually, before you go,

02:37.324 --> 02:40.125
think we can move that
back to where it was?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.327
- Yes. Of course. I'm on it.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.864
(sighs)

02:45.900 --> 02:48.534
(gentle music)

02:51.572 --> 02:56.542
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

02:57.678 --> 02:59.244
looks like someone
needs some help.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.316
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

03:06.420 --> 03:07.319
oh.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.223
Yep, I think you're stuck.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.059
Tony scotto.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.928
- Grace ryan.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.063
Wow. It has been-

03:18.098 --> 03:19.431
- it's been a while.
- Yeah.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.767
- Yeah. What happened here?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.269
- Oh, this is deer darted
out and I did what I could

03:24.305 --> 03:26.205
to avoid it, but here we are.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.440
- Well they probably thought
they saw their cousin back here

03:28.475 --> 03:29.908
and got excited.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.843
- (laughs) good one.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.945
Very good.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.580
- Couldn't help myself. (laughs)

03:34.615 --> 03:36.748
actually, do you have
some rubber mats in there?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.584
- Yeah. Why?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.419
- Hand them over?
I'll show you a trick.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.990
Aha. Perfect.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.359
Ready?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.194
Hop in. Get ready
to give it some gas.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.729
- Okay.
- There we go.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.531
That should give you some
traction. Try it now.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.836
(engine revving)

04:01.842 --> 04:03.308
all right.
- Hey.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.377
That's a pretty great trick.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.112
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.413
- Eh. It's the girl scout in me.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.582
I can't help myself.
Now it's all yours.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.884
You can unstick
yourself anytime.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.786
- Any advice if I get a flat?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.888
- Yeah. Call aaa.

04:16.924 --> 04:17.723
(both laughing)

04:17.758 --> 04:18.991
(phone ringing)

04:19.026 --> 04:19.891
oh.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.828
Um, I'm sorry. I
should take this.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.296
- No, that's okay.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.331
I should get going too,
but thanks for your help.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.901
And it was a nice
to see you again.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.869
- Nice to see you.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.738
- Happy holidays.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.772
- You too.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.340
Oh, don't forget your map.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.608
- Oh, right.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.876
- Hey sarah. What's up?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.479
Oh, okay.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.248
So you're not feeling the look
of the living room anymore.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.753
Got it. Yeah. Okay. I'll
be there in a minute.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.495
- Pop. Come on. Still
with the icicles?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.265
- Hey, it's a christmas classic.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.700
They take time.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.869
You got to give the
people what they want.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.037
- You know what the people want?

05:05.072 --> 05:07.272
The people want their christmas
decorations by christmas,

05:07.308 --> 05:08.273
not valentine's day.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.808
That's what the people want.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.711
- Your father will be up all
night if it's not perfect.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.280
And if he's up all
night, I'm up all night.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.350
Just let him do what he
needs to do for my sake.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.951
- Where do you want these, dad?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.554
- Oh, well the lights on the
trees are going to pull focus.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.957
So we need to balance out
the lawn, frame the house.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.860
Put them right there.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.362
- Here?
- Yes. Perfect.

05:31.999 --> 05:32.798
Thank you.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.799
- You got it.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.536
- Hey,

05:37.571 --> 05:39.705
whatever happened to that
marketing job you applied for?

05:39.740 --> 05:42.307
- Same thing that
always happens.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.275
It was a pleasure to meet me,

05:43.310 --> 05:45.744
but they decided to
go with somebody else.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.179
- Something will workout.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.483
- Oh. Oh. (groans)

05:51.518 --> 05:52.317
- oh! Are you
okay? Are you okay?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.285
- Ah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.219
I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay. Just watch it.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.120
- Slow, slow.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.789
You know,

05:57.825 --> 06:00.325
we should start charging by
the day instead of the job.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.428
How many houses have
we done this year, six?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.530
- Yep. And we did
eight last year.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.600
- We used to do 20
houses a year at least.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.702
His numbers have really
taken a nose-dive ever since

06:10.738 --> 06:12.938
he stopped competing in
the bright nights contest.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.608
- Talk to him. See if he's
ready to compete again.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.177
The deadline to
submit is tonight.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.279
All we have to do is
drop the application off

06:21.315 --> 06:22.447
at the christmas fest.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.683
- Why do I have to do it?
Couldn't we do it together?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.219
- No. You're the oldest.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.688
I gotta pick dante up at hockey.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.790
You got this.
- Mm.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.525
- I'm heading out.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.860
- Oh, I want to go with you.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.395
I got a few things to pick up.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.197
All right. Well we're
far enough along.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.732
You two can finish by yourself.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.967
- Sure we can.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.535
- We'll be back in an hour.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.936
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.039
- Well, guess we'd
better get a move on

06:48.075 --> 06:51.910
so we can finish before
the family gets back.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.617
(people clapping)

06:58.652 --> 06:59.885
- thank you. Thank you.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.786
Means a lot.

07:01.655 --> 07:05.357
From my family to
yours, merry christmas.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.594
(people chattering)

07:11.331 --> 07:12.998
- looks amazing, pop.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.767
- I should have brought
two more reindeer.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.770
- Let it go, dad.
Just let it go.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.704
- Okay.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.910
- I sanded the whole thing down,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.312
patched up all the dings and
nicks and stained it back

07:27.347 --> 07:28.847
to its original color.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.683
- My wife used to nurse
her son in this chair.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.586
Now he just had his first and
we wanted to pass it down.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.088
- Well, it should hold up for
a couple more generations.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.757
- It's beautiful, bill.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.826
Was glad to see your
lights still on.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.829
Heard rumor you might be
closing the stores down.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.597
- (laughs) that's a long...

07:45.632 --> 07:46.798
No plans to yet anyway.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.701
- [customer] I see you're still
in the decorating business.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.670
Noticed your yard signs around.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.205
- Yeah, that's right.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.040
Geared up for the bright
nights contest again, too.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.943
You know, going up against all
those professional decorators

07:57.978 --> 07:58.710
in town,

07:58.745 --> 08:00.812
mm, keeps on your toes.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.180
- Good luck.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.715
Well, thank you very much.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.116
Now, larry upfront will
ring you out and help you

08:05.152 --> 08:07.052
to the car with it, okay?

08:07.087 --> 08:08.019
There you go.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.654
- Hi, dad.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.122
- Hey, kiddo!

08:11.158 --> 08:12.390
- Aww.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.726
- So nice to have
you home this year.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.694
You know, you've
been gone so long

08:15.729 --> 08:18.663
and your nephew evan's
got his license now.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.232
- (laughs) okay, first of
all, you need to let it go

08:20.267 --> 08:23.468
that I went on holiday vacation
someplace warm for once.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.403
You should try it some time.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.706
And second, I know how to count.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.474
Evan is only nine.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.909
- Ten.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.311
- Oh right. November
9th, of course.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.813
- (laughs) come on.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.314
- Your mom and evan
are in the back.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.850
- Oh, I saw a paolo
buffa side table today.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.218
It was a thing of beauty.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.887
- Really? Tell me all about it.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.156
- Hey! There's my girl.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.291
- Aunt grace!

08:46.326 --> 08:50.161
- Evan! What's new, kid?
Grandpa says you're driving now.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.863
- No, not yet.
- Not yet.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.432
- With your sister and her
husband working so much overtime

08:54.468 --> 08:55.600
right now,

08:55.636 --> 08:57.536
evan has offered to help
with bright nights this year.

08:57.571 --> 09:01.373
- Good man. Speaking
of which, here you go.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.308
Yeah.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.076
- What do we got here?

09:05.112 --> 09:07.679
- Photos of the house
we decorated this year.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.347
What do you think?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.416
Just narrowing
down my submission.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.384
- Right.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.287
Some of these sort of
remind me of the designs

09:15.322 --> 09:16.955
from a few years ago,

09:16.990 --> 09:19.424
except you subbed the
snowflakes for the candy canes.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.358
What?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.961
- We're getting stale.
- No.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.896
- Yep, like January gingerbread.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.198
- Now I wouldn't
say that, it just...

09:27.234 --> 09:30.035
It never hurts to push
the creative edges, right?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.903
- Well, what we may
lack in variety,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.205
we make up for in volume.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.775
I mean, how many houses
did we do this season, 30?

09:36.810 --> 09:37.976
30, right?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.244
- Something like that.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.378
- Oh.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.315
- Oh, here you go. These
should be your submissions.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.149
- I wanna see.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.150
- Okay.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.252
- Ooh.
- What do you think?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.787
- Yeah?

09:48.822 --> 09:52.490
Okay. Let's get this
application into the committee.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.726
- You know, we really
need your spark, dear.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.295
It's what all of our
designs are missing.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.563
- Oh.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.099
- I mean, you could
be our saving grace.

10:01.134 --> 10:01.933
- Oh. (laughs)

10:01.969 --> 10:03.001
oh, bill.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.170
- What?
- Talk about stale.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.504
(laughing)

10:06.540 --> 10:07.939
come on, kiddo.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.843
- I wanted to talk to
you about good tidings.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.011
- What about it?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.146
- Well, I know how you like
to take a lot of time off

10:15.182 --> 10:18.083
from contracting during the
holidays to focus on decorating,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.518
but with the number of clients
being what they'd been the

10:20.554 --> 10:21.453
last couple of years,

10:21.488 --> 10:22.687
you're losing a lot
more than you're making.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.456
- No, stop. Stop here.
- What?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.758
- What is this?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.861
- Is that the inglid's house?

10:29.896 --> 10:31.463
- It is.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.131
- They've been a
customer of yours for...

10:33.166 --> 10:34.065
- 10 years.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.870
- Guess they decided to go a
different direction this year.

10:38.905 --> 10:39.838
- I guess they did.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.275
What the heck is glowscapes?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.344
- I think we're looking at it.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.013
- Popular, by the looks of it.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.115
- Looks like it's
easy to set up too.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.118
I bet you could do a few of
those in one day, no problem.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.953
- Anybody can string
up a bunch of lights

10:54.988 --> 10:57.622
and enter a computer code.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.857
Where's the soul in that?

10:59.893 --> 11:00.959
The heart?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.394
Do you see the people's faces

11:02.429 --> 11:04.663
when I flip the light switch on,

11:04.698 --> 11:07.132
that spark of joy in their eyes?

11:08.268 --> 11:11.870
All because of
something we've created.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.705
I mean, it's-

11:13.740 --> 11:14.973
- magical.
- It is.

11:15.008 --> 11:15.674
- I know.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.475
And I love how it lights you up.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.246
But without the bump
from bright nights,

11:21.281 --> 11:24.182
good tidings is becoming more
of a hobby than a business.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.583
- It's not always
about the money.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.253
- I know, but why don't
you show the people

11:28.288 --> 11:30.221
of this town what
you're capable of?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.224
There's a reason you won
the first five bright nights

11:33.260 --> 11:34.192
contests.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.661
- I don't think so.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.431
- Dad, come on.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.100
- I haven't competed
in eight years.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.703
And you remember what
happened last time?

11:44.738 --> 11:45.670
- Yeah, sure.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.739
You ran out of time.
You got disqualified.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.745
But so what, that's not
going to happen this time.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.449
I'm going to be there and
mom's going to be there

11:57.484 --> 11:58.850
and maria is going to be there.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.018
- Really?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.787
- Yes. Maria said she'd help
fill out the application.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.824
We can get it to the committee
before registration closes.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.593
You're the best in town, pop.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.830
I mean, it says it right
there on your signs.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.571
- Okay.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.405
- Yeah?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.406
- Let's do it.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.407
- Okay.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.274
- Okay.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.512
(engine starting)

12:32.185 --> 12:34.953
(bells jingling)

12:41.128 --> 12:44.195
(people chattering)

12:45.499 --> 12:48.399
- so we staged the
home of this producer

12:48.435 --> 12:51.336
and they got a kick out of us,

12:51.371 --> 12:55.106
thought that we made a charming
team, their words, not mine.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.344
Anyway, they said that
we'd make a fun host

12:59.379 --> 13:01.179
for a home staging show.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.447
- Oh.
- I know.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.682
Anyway, we're going to talk to
them in the new year about it

13:04.718 --> 13:06.084
and we'll see what happens.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.752
- That is incredible, grace.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.721
- Yeah. Yeah. It is just...

13:11.224 --> 13:12.657
- What?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.425
- Sarah and I have been
on different pages lately,

13:14.461 --> 13:17.095
just completely out of sync.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.031
- Being friends and
business partners

13:20.066 --> 13:22.500
takes a delicate touch.

13:22.536 --> 13:23.968
Ask your father.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.937
He still avoids every
street with a house designed

13:25.972 --> 13:27.806
by the scottos. (laughs)

13:27.841 --> 13:29.874
- yeah, well you'd think 20
years would be enough time

13:29.910 --> 13:31.342
for bygones to be bygones.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.611
- Ha ha. Not a chance.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.447
- Did you ask santa
for what you wanted?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.951
- A secrets of the great
magicians magic set.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.488
- Oh, so you're into magic
these days. That's pretty cool.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.656
- Lean down, aunt grace.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.590
- Okay.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.393
What've we got here?

13:48.428 --> 13:51.596
Okay. Oh boy. Starting out good.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.470
Whoa! That is
incredible. Nicely done.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.806
Okay, now can you do that
with a chicken sandwich

14:01.842 --> 14:03.174
because I am starving.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.075
- I can't, aunt grace.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.810
- You let me down, kid.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.078
All right.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.546
Well, I'm going to
grab something to eat,

14:08.582 --> 14:10.548
but I'll meet you guys at
the bright nights booth?

14:10.584 --> 14:12.984
- Yep. Okay, come
on you. Good work.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.553
- How did you get dad
to change his mind

14:15.589 --> 14:16.855
about bright nights?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.324
- How do you think? I
appealed to his ego.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.860
He saw a bunch of people lining
up to see a house decorated

14:21.895 --> 14:23.862
by that new company, glowscapes.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.264
I think that really
lit a fire under him.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.498
- Nono can bring it.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.733
- Yes.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.535
- Let's hope that attention
to detail that makes him such

14:30.570 --> 14:32.537
a great contractor doesn't
freeze him up this year.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.906
- If we get into
bright night finals,

14:34.941 --> 14:37.375
I'm telling you we can win it.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.378
- If, ifs and buts
were candy and nuts,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.580
what a merry
christmas it would be.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.454
- Two pizzelles, please.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.723
- What he said. Thank you.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.962
And a half dozen
assorted, please.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.266
- That's a lot, uncle
tony. Not good for you.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.734
- Well, they're not for me.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.569
Thank you.

15:07.841 --> 15:08.740
Excuse me.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.577
I know it's usually the girl
scouts giving the cookies,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.112
but I wanted to thank
you for the other day.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.447
- It wasn't anything really.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.417
- If you were your
dad and I was my dad,

15:19.452 --> 15:22.220
you would have just kept
driving, so it's not nothing.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.823
- Well, fortunately, we're
not our fathers. (laughs)

15:25.859 --> 15:28.726
and who is this young
man? Is this your son?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.296
- No, no, no, no. This
is my nephew, dante.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.730
- What are you
talking about, dad?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.332
- Oh.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.767
- Quit playing, dante.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.002
He's my sister maria's kid.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.604
- Who's maria, dad?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.472
- All right. Cut it out.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.941
He thinks he's funny.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.142
- Well I'm entertained.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.778
- You want these?

15:46.813 --> 15:48.980
- Yes, uncle tony.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.516
- Get.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.984
I think I see maria over there.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.454
Are you here with your parents?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.289
- Yeah. And my nephew.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.825
- So where do you call home?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.393
- Richmond, actually.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.831
- I just came back about
a year ago from boston.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.971
- Grace will find out about
the stores eventually, dear.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.606
- I just don't want to
worry her unnecessarily.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.176
I got us into this
mess, I can get us out.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.143
- Mm hm.

16:21.014 --> 16:21.913
- Hello.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.116
- Your wade...

16:26.019 --> 16:28.353
Of glowscapes by wade?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.854
- Wade edwards,
pleased to meet you.

16:29.889 --> 16:33.324
- (laughs) I'm wendy ryerson
head of the committee.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.793
My husband and I can't
pass by one of your houses

16:35.829 --> 16:37.295
without stopping.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.864
It's like 4th of
July in December.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.967
- I'm so glad it brings you joy.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.537
- We'll be reviewing
the applications and
the committee will

16:46.573 --> 16:49.407
reach out to the four
prelim qualifiers sometime

16:49.442 --> 16:51.309
in a day or so.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.545
Be sure to keep your
ringer on. (laughs)

16:57.050 --> 16:57.849
hi!

16:57.884 --> 16:59.584
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.919
- Can't wait to see what
you ryans have for us

17:01.955 --> 17:04.022
under your santa caps this year.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.757
It's going to be pretty
stiff competition

17:05.792 --> 17:08.926
with glowscapes in
the mix. (laughs)

17:08.962 --> 17:11.696
- you're going to show
our work as always wendy.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.598
- I don't know if you've
heard, but this year,

17:13.633 --> 17:16.234
in addition to the municipal
contract to decorate every

17:16.269 --> 17:19.670
public building at ashland
falls next holiday season,

17:19.706 --> 17:22.774
cardinal group energy is
sponsoring a cash prize.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.941
- How much?

17:23.977 --> 17:25.910
- $50,000!

17:25.945 --> 17:27.512
- Whoa!
- You're kidding me?

17:27.547 --> 17:30.948
- Not a bad stocking
stuffer. Right? (laughs)

17:30.984 --> 17:31.949
well, good luck!

17:31.985 --> 17:33.885
- Well, thank you.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.255
- You're going to need all
the luck you can get, bill,

17:37.290 --> 17:40.358
because those tired
designs you're used to,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.060
aren't going to
cut it this year.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.629
- Well I didn't see many of
your lawn signs out there

17:44.664 --> 17:46.264
this season, frank.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.900
Seems to me that
it's your designs

17:48.935 --> 17:51.202
that people are no longer
interested in these days.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.870
- Okay, bill. That's enough.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.305
- Don't start, frank.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.873
- There's nothing
to worry about.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.875
Probably won't even
finish his design,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.411
if he's chosen to compete.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.814
- Excuse me, I don't
remember you winning anything

18:02.849 --> 18:04.215
these last couple of years.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.250
- Remind me when the
last time you won was.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.151
Can you remember?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.352
- [wendy] gentlemen, please!

18:08.388 --> 18:10.455
- Well, I don't need an award
to feel good about myself,

18:10.490 --> 18:11.989
like some people I know.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.325
- Oh, oh, you want to settle
this old fashioned way?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.326
- Sure, I would like that.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.561
- Huh, you want that? Come on.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.829
No. You heard what
he said to me.

18:17.864 --> 18:18.930
- Dad?
- Pop?

18:18.965 --> 18:22.633
(frank and bill bickering)

18:22.669 --> 18:23.668
- come on! Cut it out!

18:23.703 --> 18:24.836
What's going on?
What's going on?

18:24.871 --> 18:28.139
- Oh, just your father and
bill ryan going at it again.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.407
- If you two don't knock it off,

18:29.442 --> 18:32.610
the committee will disqualify
both of you from the contest.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.746
- But this is
christmas, gentlemen.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.849
This is the season of forgiving.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.451
- Bill, come on, come on.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.524
- What if dante sees you?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.527
Do you want him to see his
nono making a fool of himself

18:49.562 --> 18:51.496
in front of everyone
in the town?

19:04.711 --> 19:07.545
- No-no, who was that man
you were arguing with?

19:07.580 --> 19:08.513
- Nobody.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.081
- Mm. They used to be friends.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.016
- Good friends,
once upon a time.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.286
- Started a holiday decorating
company in college together.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.588
- Yeah and kept it going
after they graduated.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.690
They called it making
spirits bright,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.360
was a nice little business
for them during the holidays.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.428
- We even used to spend
christmases together.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.230
- What happened then?

19:26.266 --> 19:27.431
- Well...

19:27.467 --> 19:30.234
He kept pestering me
to decorate faster

19:30.270 --> 19:32.170
so we could get more clients.

19:33.273 --> 19:37.475
And all I really cared about
was doing the quality of work.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.277
He cared about the money.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.979
So we got into an
argument and he kicked me

19:42.015 --> 19:43.047
out of the company.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.383
- Yes. I broke up the company.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.919
Because frank told
me that I was greedy,

19:48.755 --> 19:51.422
that I put quantity
over quality.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.424
Just because I wanted to
make a few extra dollars

19:53.459 --> 19:54.559
doing something we both loved,

19:54.594 --> 19:57.595
doesn't make my reasons for
doing it any less noble.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.797
- They were a great partnership.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.966
- We brought out the
best of each other...

20:03.469 --> 20:04.735
For a time.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.237
You know, he would
draw up the designs

20:06.272 --> 20:09.106
and I'd put a plan
together and execute them.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.475
But when he insulted
me, that was it.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.944
That was the end of our business

20:12.979 --> 20:15.112
and the end of our friendship.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.949
- And that's when grandpa
opened up the furniture store

20:17.984 --> 20:20.685
and turned making spirits
bright into deck the halls.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.787
- Can't you just
apologize and make up?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.322
You two were so close.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.091
- Apologize to him
after what he said?

20:27.126 --> 20:28.859
He should be apologizing to me.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.028
- It's a shame what
happened between you two

20:31.064 --> 20:32.630
is all I'm saying.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.165
- No, the only shame here is
that frank was never admit

20:34.200 --> 20:35.766
he was wrong.

20:35.802 --> 20:36.734
Now come on.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.306
(grace sighs)

20:42.342 --> 20:45.276
- dad, I am going to
take dante to school.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.110
- Give him a kiss for me.

20:46.145 --> 20:46.944
- I will.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.448
- Have a good day.
- You too.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.619
- Hey dad.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.786
I'm not going to
be able to help out

20:55.822 --> 20:58.556
with good tidings tonight
'cause I got a shift at the bar.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.057
- Well that's all right.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.859
We don't have any
customers anyway.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.898
Listen, I know it's
not your dream job,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.967
but if you ever want to learn
the contracting business

21:10.003 --> 21:13.204
from your old man, my
door is always open.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.841
- I will think about it.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.510
Thanks pop..

21:27.353 --> 21:29.420
- Remember making this?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.354
- No way.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.824
- You made it at
the ryan's house.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.194
Such good memories
of those times.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.097
You saw arlene ryan's
grandson, right?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.098
- Yeah.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.233
- He's the same age as dante.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.134
- Really?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.903
- It's a shame they
don't know each other.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.174
Oh, remember who made this one?

21:50.209 --> 21:51.609
- Maria?

21:51.644 --> 21:52.543
- Grace.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.513
That'll be nice to have one
from the others on our trees.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.616
They have an ornament that maria
made, found it in this box.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.318
It's been mislabeled.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.455
I think I will sneak this
around the back of the tree,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.390
so your father
doesn't make a stink.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.325
- Good idea.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.627
- Que bella, huh?.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.761
- Yes. Nice.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.196
- I meant grace.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.097
- Mom.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.533
- Oh, she's turned
into a beautiful woman.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.367
- Ma.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.234
- Okay.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.369
Okay. Okay. I'll stop.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.071
- All right. I gotta go.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.139
I'll see you later.
I love you, okay?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.541
Ciao, mom.
- Ciao.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.215
- Your father works fast.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.583
- I know. He's a machine.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.751
Okay.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.685
Red or green?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.221
- They're both nice.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.156
- What color will be
good in the windows?

22:39.192 --> 22:41.659
- Either. They're
just wreaths, honey.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.427
There's no wrong choice.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.496
- Been having trouble
parsing good taste from bad

22:45.531 --> 22:46.430
these days.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.468
- [bill] you guys
gabbing or working?

22:50.503 --> 22:52.737
- Remind me how much
you're paying us again.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.572
- You want to be paid? Huh.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.274
The nerve.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.276
My love and affection
should be more than enough.

22:59.979 --> 23:04.215
("deck the halls" instrumental)

23:09.355 --> 23:10.688
- good crowd tonight.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.089
- Yeah, nothing gets
people out to the bar

23:12.125 --> 23:14.158
like extended time
with their families.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.695
Ya know, there might
even be some single women

23:17.730 --> 23:20.197
out here tonight that's
looking to meet a nice guy.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.432
Keep your eyes peeled.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.534
- Sure, sure.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.836
- Hey, what about lisa?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.539
I heard her say you
weren't unattractive.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.474
- Nothing says interested
like a double negative.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.777
(laughing)

23:34.647 --> 23:36.213
- this seat taken?

23:36.249 --> 23:38.682
- Well, it's not, not taken.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.152
- So someone is sitting here?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.187
- No, it's all yours, grace.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.955
- Oh, you two know each other?

23:44.991 --> 23:48.192
- Yeah, childhood
friends and what now...

23:48.227 --> 23:50.895
Decades old family feud.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.831
- Well, in that case,
drinks on the house.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.366
Keep the peace between you two.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.201
- Manhattan up. Thanks.

23:58.171 --> 24:00.638
- So what brings you in tonight?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.039
- Oh, I had to get
out of the house.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.508
I mean, it's pacing
a hole in the floor

24:04.544 --> 24:05.643
waiting to hear
about bright night.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.646
- Yeah, mine's probably wearing
out the carpet right now

24:08.681 --> 24:09.613
as we speak.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.083
- Thank you.

24:13.119 --> 24:13.984
Oh.

24:15.855 --> 24:16.720
Mm.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.490
Well that's not, not delicious.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.659
- See, that's how you do it.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.395
- Whatever. You take your 10.
I'll let you two catch up.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.564
And you let me
know anything else.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.969
- Been working here long?

24:33.005 --> 24:35.005
- No, he just throws me
shifts every once in a while,

24:35.041 --> 24:36.774
when it's really busy.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.443
Truth be told anything
more than a vodka soda

24:39.479 --> 24:41.078
and I am way out of my depth.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.380
- (laughs) well, I'm glad
he's making my drink then.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.782
- [tony] yeah.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.550
Seems like a good friend.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.919
- Yes. Yeah, he's a good guy.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.288
We played hockey together
at bishop o'connell.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.925
- And you got a hockey
scholarship to that fancy school

24:54.961 --> 24:56.694
in arlington, right?

24:56.729 --> 24:59.463
Yeah, probably why we
never ran into each other.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.765
- Are you keeping tabs on me?

25:01.801 --> 25:03.601
- One hears things.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.535
- Okay.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.270
Well you heard right.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.607
After arlington, I played
hockey at boston university,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.477
but I blew out my
knee sophomore year

25:13.513 --> 25:16.747
and that was kind of the
end of my hockey career.

25:16.782 --> 25:17.748
- That must've been hard.

25:17.783 --> 25:18.716
- Yeah, it was.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.285
But it was also kind of
a blessing in disguise

25:21.320 --> 25:25.422
because it made me focus on
school, for like the first time.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.590
I got my mba.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.425
- And what brought
you back home?

25:28.461 --> 25:31.428
- I was working for
this marketing company.

25:31.464 --> 25:34.498
I took a big swing
on this campaign,

25:34.534 --> 25:38.002
missed completely,
landed flat on my face,

25:38.037 --> 25:40.070
got canned and then I
moved back here last year

25:40.106 --> 25:42.339
with my tail between my legs.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.475
- Well, there's something
to be said about going

25:44.510 --> 25:45.409
with your instincts,

25:45.444 --> 25:47.578
you know, just putting
it all out there.

25:47.613 --> 25:48.779
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:48.814 --> 25:49.780
- Don't.

25:49.815 --> 25:52.483
(laughing)

25:52.518 --> 25:54.952
so what about you? What
have you been up to?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.754
- My college roommate
and I started

25:56.789 --> 25:59.089
a home staging business.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.926
"at upstaged, we're the
last stage you will need

26:01.961 --> 26:05.763
before selling your
home." (laughs)

26:05.798 --> 26:06.764
- catchy.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.432
- Did you like that?

26:08.467 --> 26:10.868
It was actually sarah,
my business partner,

26:10.903 --> 26:11.802
who came up with it.

26:11.837 --> 26:15.306
She's the show-woman,
charmed for days.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.674
- And what, what's your role?

26:16.709 --> 26:19.510
Are you the creative
genius behind the curtain?

26:19.545 --> 26:20.711
- Oh, boy.

26:20.746 --> 26:25.549
Truth be told, I'm feeling
about as confident these days

26:25.585 --> 26:28.686
as you making a slow-gin fizz.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.054
- I don't even
know what that is.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.055
- You don't know what that is?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.790
- No. Does it mean you
make it really slowly?

26:32.825 --> 26:35.359
- Hey you two, a table
just opened up in the back.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.027
It's a little quieter.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.662
- Don't you need
me to work though?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.965
- Well, I haven't had to
remake any drinks tonight,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.233
so the two of you chatting
is actually saving me money.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.302
- Wow. (laughing)

26:45.338 --> 26:46.203
- thanks.

26:52.912 --> 26:53.877
- You like that?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.647
That's my mom.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.017
We officially made it
into bright nights.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.352
- Congratulations.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.121
(phone buzzing)

27:06.592 --> 27:07.491
so did we.

27:08.628 --> 27:12.663
- Well, guess this feud isn't
going away anytime soon,

27:12.698 --> 27:13.864
is it?

27:13.899 --> 27:14.798
- I guess not.

27:15.968 --> 27:16.867
- Game on.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.811
- Congratulations to
each of our four teams,

27:27.847 --> 27:30.948
deck the halls, good
tidings, glowscapes,

27:30.983 --> 27:34.718
and our last year's
winner, mistletoe design.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.654
Each of you will be
randomly assigned

27:36.689 --> 27:38.756
one of these lovely
homes around us.

27:38.791 --> 27:42.426
And you'll have three days
to transform your deck house

27:42.461 --> 27:45.829
as thoroughly as your
imagination allows.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.966
And any house that is
not completed by 6:00 pm

27:49.001 --> 27:53.070
on the 21st will be disqualified
from the competition.

27:53.105 --> 27:56.573
Though I've been assured that
won't be an issue this year.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.410
Our three person committee
will judge each deck house

27:59.445 --> 28:02.579
on creativity,
technical achievement,

28:02.615 --> 28:04.515
and most importantly,

28:04.550 --> 28:08.485
the ooh and the ah factor.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.355
Who will then select two
finalists to go head to head

28:11.390 --> 28:12.923
for the grand prize.

28:12.958 --> 28:17.261
A contract from the town of
ashland falls worth $25,000

28:19.665 --> 28:23.300
to decorate every municipal
building next holiday season.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.303
And this year cardinal
group energy is sponsoring

28:26.338 --> 28:29.473
an additional $50,000
prize to the winner!

28:30.242 --> 28:33.243
(crowd applauding)

28:36.248 --> 28:39.983
- hi, just wanted to
come introduce myself.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.151
Wade edwards.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.219
- Bill ryan.
- Hi.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.187
- Nice to meet you.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.154
This is my daughter, grace.

28:44.190 --> 28:44.955
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

28:44.990 --> 28:45.556
- And my wife, arlene.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.124
- Oh, hi.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.293
- So I've seen
your work, it's...

28:50.329 --> 28:51.729
Colorful,

28:51.764 --> 28:52.796
different.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.198
- Yeah, I think that's
why people are responding

28:54.233 --> 28:55.499
the way they are.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.534
Hired two new crews to
keep up with demand.

28:58.637 --> 28:59.737
I'm sure you knew what that
was like back when you were

28:59.772 --> 29:01.004
at the top of your game.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.342
- I like to think I'm still
at the top of my game, wade.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.712
- Right, yeah, been five
years since you last one?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.647
- Six, but who's counting?

29:10.683 --> 29:14.017
- Well every year's a chance
turn it all around. Right?

29:14.053 --> 29:15.252
Anyway.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.653
Good luck.

29:16.689 --> 29:17.554
- You too.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.660
- Your deck house will be
that one right over there.

29:23.696 --> 29:24.995
- Oh great.

29:25.030 --> 29:25.929
- We can work with that.

29:25.965 --> 29:26.764
- All right.

29:26.799 --> 29:27.765
- Yeah, good.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.033
- And yours will be next
to deck the halls, okay?

29:31.203 --> 29:32.069
- Okay.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.105
- Right.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.173
So we'll take a
bunch of photographs

29:36.208 --> 29:37.541
and then I'll go
back to the shop

29:37.576 --> 29:38.842
and start plotting the design.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.077
- Right.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.345
- A lot riding on
things this year,

29:41.380 --> 29:42.780
so we can't waste
a single moment.

29:42.815 --> 29:43.747
- Yeah.

29:43.783 --> 29:44.915
- [grace] what was that dad?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.550
- Oh, I was just telling
your mother that second place

29:46.585 --> 29:47.785
won't cut it this year.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.521
- Ah, right, because second
place is just the first loser.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.855
Yeah.
- Exactly right.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.123
Anyway. Come on.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.591
- You always give the
best pep talks, dad.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.526
(laughing)

29:55.561 --> 29:56.426
- come on.
- Yep.

29:57.663 --> 30:00.531
(cheerful music)

30:08.007 --> 30:09.306
- what about this color scheme?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.074
You think that would work again?

30:13.946 --> 30:15.813
Just dad's really
in the zone, huh?

30:15.848 --> 30:17.581
- And he wants to make a
strong showing after being

30:17.616 --> 30:19.683
out of the competition
for so long.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.154
- You want some hot chocolate?

30:24.190 --> 30:26.056
- Yes, sure. Fuel for the fire.

30:26.091 --> 30:26.957
- Yes, please.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.100
- Do you want something?

30:37.136 --> 30:39.269
- Oh yes. I'll take a
hot chocolate please.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.571
It's been an hour
since I had some,

30:40.606 --> 30:42.272
my body's going
through withdrawal.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.640
(laughing)

30:43.676 --> 30:44.641
- thank you.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.011
- And here, let me get
that for you. Thank you.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.180
And two more, please.
Keep the change.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.782
- You don't have-

30:51.817 --> 30:53.083
- after the pizzelles and
the free drinks last night,

30:53.118 --> 30:54.818
it's the least I can do.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.955
- Ah, thank you.
I appreciate that.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.923
I'm glad we ran into each other.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.526
I wanted to tell you what a
nice time I had last night.

31:02.561 --> 31:03.794
- Me too.

31:03.829 --> 31:07.531
I can't remember the last time
I stayed out until last call.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.366
- Well, I definitely prefer
doing it on that side

31:09.401 --> 31:10.834
of the bar, that's for sure.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.604
- Are you sure pat wasn't upset?

31:13.639 --> 31:15.305
- Oh yeah, he's fine.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.141
I think he's just happy to
see me having a good time.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.244
- Is that so rare?

31:21.413 --> 31:24.982
- Not as frequent as
I'd like it to be,

31:25.017 --> 31:29.152
but bumping into you around
town definitely helps.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.522
Are you just out
enjoying the calm

31:32.558 --> 31:33.957
before the bright night's storm.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.459
- Ah, yeah.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.994
My mom and I are taking
out my nephew just before

31:37.029 --> 31:38.128
we start helping dad.

31:39.365 --> 31:43.867
And your dad, is he working on
his sketches for the contest?

31:43.903 --> 31:46.136
- Oh, yeah. He's deep in it.

31:46.171 --> 31:47.871
You know, your father
better watch out,

31:47.907 --> 31:50.407
substituting candy
canes for snowflakes

31:50.442 --> 31:51.575
ain't going to cut it this year.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.178
- Yeah. Well, I think he's
got a few tricks in his bag.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.146
- Sure.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.281
But I mean, you have to admit,

31:57.316 --> 31:59.249
his designs are kind of looking
the same the last couple

31:59.285 --> 32:00.384
of years, so.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.552
- Oh, maybe your dad should
spend less time dreaming

32:02.588 --> 32:05.022
up his designs and more
time executing them.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.392
- Yeah. Maybe.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.796
Well, thank you for
the hot chocolate.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.401
I guess this makes
us square now.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.202
- Yeah, I guess it does.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.039
- I'll see you later.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.910
- Oh, thank you, honey.

32:26.946 --> 32:27.878
- Thank you.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.218
- Don't you think that's
a little ambitious?

32:36.588 --> 32:39.389
Maybe we should save
that for the finals,

32:40.459 --> 32:42.759
go with something a little
simpler for the prelims?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.229
- Well, we have to
make it to the finals.

32:52.905 --> 32:54.604
- [bill] something's
missing, isn't there?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.139
- The only thing
that's not in there

32:56.175 --> 32:58.809
is a complete re-creation
of santa's workshop.

32:58.844 --> 33:01.578
Keep in mind, we don't want
the deck house to collapse.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.480
- It's got to sing, grace.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.282
I mean the committee has to
have its collective breath

33:05.317 --> 33:06.583
taken away.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.784
- Yes, I know. And
you will get there.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.320
I just think that
you're possibly
overstuffing the designs

33:10.356 --> 33:12.055
in hopes that bigger
equals better.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.958
- Yeah, but you've always
been able to spin my ideas

33:14.994 --> 33:17.627
into gold, so come
on, spin away.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.162
- I think once
you start editing,

33:19.198 --> 33:20.964
you'll find the story
you want to tell.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.965
- Yeah, right,

33:22.001 --> 33:23.266
- bill.
- Hm?

33:23.302 --> 33:25.035
- It's alonzo, said
it was important.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.739
- (sighs) okay.
I'll be right back.

33:28.774 --> 33:29.639
- Yep.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.777
Is it me or does he seem
more stressed this year?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.345
- Oh.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.481
I think frank scotto
being in the contest again

33:37.516 --> 33:38.515
is making him anxious.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.483
- Right.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.250
- You did not hear that from me.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.752
(phone ringing)

33:41.787 --> 33:43.720
- oh, it's sarah.
I should take this.

33:44.556 --> 33:45.422
Sorry.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.525
Hey.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.793
- [sarah] how goes
it go it, lady?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.094
- Uh, fine.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.131
- Try to contain
your excitement.

33:55.234 --> 33:58.468
- Yeah. I'm helping dad
with the competition again.

33:58.504 --> 33:59.936
- Pulled you in again, huh?

33:59.972 --> 34:00.971
- Neck deep.

34:01.974 --> 34:03.473
- The reason I called was,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.675
the producers invited us to
their annual holiday party

34:05.711 --> 34:08.311
at the whisper in carytown.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.212
- Uh, sorry.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.614
Sorry, what day?

34:10.649 --> 34:11.782
- 21st.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.885
- Yeah, sure. I'll be there.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.154
Do you think that they'll want
us to talk about our ideas

34:17.189 --> 34:18.121
for the show?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.356
Should we prepare something?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.824
- It's a party.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.726
Can't imagine they'd
want to discuss business.

34:22.761 --> 34:23.994
- Right?

34:24.029 --> 34:24.661
- [sarah] see you
there. All right?

34:24.696 --> 34:25.462
- See you there.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.666
Everything okay, dad?

34:29.701 --> 34:31.168
- Yeah, it's all good.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.337
Let's just get back to it, okay?

34:34.373 --> 34:35.205
- Yeah.

34:42.548 --> 34:45.582
- Hey, ma. When's that
lasagna going to be ready?

34:45.617 --> 34:47.384
- Don't rush the artista.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.956
(fans cheering on tv)

34:52.991 --> 34:56.093
- how do they get the puck
into the air like that?

34:56.128 --> 35:00.197
- They practice and then
they practice some more,

35:00.232 --> 35:01.865
but there are some
tricks you can learn.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.567
Juggling is a good
place to start.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.936
- Juggling? No way, uncle t.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.872
- It's good for the
hand-eye coordination.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.209
- Your uncle used to
practice every night.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.778
He always pushed himself
to try to be the best.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.215
Even when things
seemed impossible,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.350
he always pushed through.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.719
There was no quit in him.

35:25.257 --> 35:29.326
- I should get going. Pat needs
me down at the bar tonight.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.260
Juggle.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.998
- I think I'm going to
learn how to juggle.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.032
- Me, too.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.684
- [news man] at ashland
falls as the 15th annual

35:54.720 --> 35:55.986
bright nights competition.

35:56.021 --> 35:56.953
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.256
- Where's your mother?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.358
- She took evan sledding. She'll
meet us at the deck house.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.592
- Oh, okay.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.860
- Glowscapes.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.495
The holiday displays
that have been the talk

36:05.531 --> 36:09.266
of ashland falls this season
are the work of wade edwards.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.534
Tell us more wade.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.269
- Families have been
stringing up lights,

36:12.304 --> 36:14.371
putting a snowman on a lawn
and lining their walkways

36:14.406 --> 36:17.440
with candy canes
since, well, forever.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.544
With glowscapes, I wanted to
show there was another way,

36:20.579 --> 36:23.180
a better way to decorate
your home for the holidays.

36:23.215 --> 36:26.950
- An alexandria native, wade
first saw the led technology

36:26.985 --> 36:31.054
he adopted online and
knew it was the future.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.490
- How does he swing
publicity like this?

36:33.525 --> 36:35.692
- Maybe glowscapes
is just that popular.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.295
I mean, people are lining
up just to catch a glimpse.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.630
- Wade edwards and
glowscapes aim to do

36:40.666 --> 36:42.465
to the holiday decorating space,

36:42.501 --> 36:45.235
what streaming did
for the video store.

36:45.270 --> 36:48.705
With the crowds flocking to
get a gander at his creations,

36:48.740 --> 36:51.107
the future of glowscapes
looks bright indeed.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.211
- All right, well,
let's get to work.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.345
We got a lot to do.

36:57.516 --> 36:58.682
- I still don't get how he
gets publicity like that.

36:58.717 --> 37:03.687
- And remember you have three
days to complete your deck

37:05.023 --> 37:07.691
house and to give
everyone equal time,

37:07.726 --> 37:11.061
each team begins
work at 9:00 am,

37:11.096 --> 37:14.831
but it's staple guns
down at exactly 6:00 pm.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.267
You may test your design
once it gets dark,

37:17.302 --> 37:20.837
but no work can be
completed after six.

37:20.872 --> 37:24.407
And you may start
your sleighs...

37:24.443 --> 37:26.176
Now!

37:26.211 --> 37:27.577
- Okay.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.512
I think I've come up
with a simpler design,

37:29.548 --> 37:32.115
something a little
bit more practical.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.517
- I need two cross beams,
one light going this way,

37:34.553 --> 37:36.886
one light going this way
and it's doing a dance,

37:36.922 --> 37:38.188
it's doing a dance.

37:38.223 --> 37:39.422
- I've got it right here!

37:39.458 --> 37:40.724
- Get the landscape
out of the way.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.558
This bush has to go.
That bush has to go.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.360
These bushes have to go.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.194
- Don't forget to have fun.

37:44.229 --> 37:45.895
- Yeah. No problem.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.401
- By the way. Who's alonzo?

37:52.671 --> 37:53.770
- What?

37:53.805 --> 37:56.239
- Whoever dad was talking
to on the call yesterday,

37:56.275 --> 37:59.142
it seemed serious, his
whole demeanor changed.

37:59.177 --> 38:02.412
- He's the manager at
our store in midlothian.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.346
- Is everything, okay?

38:03.382 --> 38:05.715
- Things are a little
slower than usual.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.451
- I overheard a customer
tell dad that he thought

38:08.487 --> 38:09.719
the store was closing.

38:11.490 --> 38:15.425
Mom, if there's something
up I want to try and help.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.297
- The expansion last year
hasn't gone as well as

38:20.332 --> 38:21.598
we would have hoped.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.934
- Ah. Well, how not
well are we talking?

38:24.970 --> 38:27.971
- Your father's sales
projections were a little off.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.140
With the lease on
the new building

38:30.175 --> 38:32.842
and inventory costs doubling,

38:32.878 --> 38:35.812
the stores are operating
at a loss right now.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.080
You know your father,

38:37.115 --> 38:39.983
he's always pushing
for bigger, better.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.519
And this time he may
have gone too big.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.020
- Why didn't you
tell me any of this?

38:44.056 --> 38:45.755
- He thought we
could work it out

38:46.792 --> 38:49.659
and you would have dropped
everything to help.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.662
- Yeah, but that decision should
have been up to me to make.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.130
- Well now you know.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.868
So if he seems more amped about
the competition this year,

38:58.904 --> 39:01.805
it's because that extra
50,000 would go a long way.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.074
- Yeah.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.113
- Maria, why don't you start
with putting the lights

39:10.148 --> 39:11.781
on the christmas trees?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.850
Anthony and I, we will
start on the roof.

39:13.885 --> 39:14.984
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:18.323 --> 39:22.025
- Tony, stop eyeballing
the competition.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.693
No matter how attractive she is.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.863
- Whatever.
- Come on.

39:32.371 --> 39:36.706
("oh, christmas
tree" instrumental)

39:42.948 --> 39:44.647
- three, two, one.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.649
Everybody's stop for the day!

39:46.685 --> 39:47.917
Hands up! Up, up!

39:47.953 --> 39:49.386
Okay? Over there?

39:53.191 --> 39:57.060
("silent night" instrumental)

40:01.800 --> 40:03.533
- you okay?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.001
- Yeah.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.270
I'm looking at these box
of ornaments that I found

40:07.305 --> 40:08.671
behind the couch.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.775
- The ones the ryans made
that mom tried to hide?

40:11.810 --> 40:14.978
- She thinks she's
sly, but I'm onto her.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.582
- You know, it's okay to admit
that you miss those times

40:19.618 --> 40:20.517
with them.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.053
- That well of nostalgia
dried up a long time ago.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.425
Bill ryan made sure of that.

40:30.662 --> 40:31.561
- Okay.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.431
Have you seen mom?

40:35.367 --> 40:37.801
- She went to meet a
friend for dessert.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.538
- All right. Well, I'm going
to go see pat down at the pub.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.505
I'll see you later?

40:47.913 --> 40:51.347
(indistinct chattering)

40:53.819 --> 40:54.984
hey.

40:55.020 --> 40:55.919
- Hey.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.989
Your deck house is
really coming along.

41:00.025 --> 41:00.990
- Oh, thanks.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.025
Yeah, yours too.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.928
Hey look, about what
I said at the market.

41:06.064 --> 41:09.299
You know, I think a couple of
decades of listening to my dad

41:10.435 --> 41:12.836
complain about your father's
work, it kinda creeped in.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.437
So,

41:14.473 --> 41:15.305
I'm sorry.

41:17.108 --> 41:20.176
I think your dad's really upped
his game lately, actually.

41:20.212 --> 41:21.611
- Thanks.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.379
And I'm sorry too.

41:25.484 --> 41:26.983
Oh!

41:27.018 --> 41:30.420
Oh, no! What's
happening? (laughs)

41:30.455 --> 41:32.755
I guess we're in the
middle of a snowball fight.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.958
(crowd yelling and laughing)

41:34.993 --> 41:36.426
- watch out! Watch out!

41:36.461 --> 41:37.494
Ah!

41:37.529 --> 41:38.495
(laughing)

41:38.530 --> 41:40.797
- oh, goodness. Are you okay?

41:40.832 --> 41:44.434
- I don't think
anything's broken.

41:44.469 --> 41:46.836
- Oh, you've got a little...

41:55.514 --> 41:56.346
- Check it out.

41:58.416 --> 41:59.616
- The grandkids together.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.650
- Oh, yeah.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.318
- It would be so good for them.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.196
- So you two have been
meeting since we were kids?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.397
- Mm.
- Mm hm.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.667
- Just because your fathers
have held this ridiculous grudge

42:17.702 --> 42:19.769
never meant we had to
stop being friends.

42:19.804 --> 42:22.605
- We still take a girls trip
to virginia beach every summer.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.773
- [arlene] mm hm.

42:23.808 --> 42:25.775
- And dad and
frank have no idea?

42:25.810 --> 42:28.511
- They're just too
stubborn to acknowledge it.

42:28.547 --> 42:31.281
They're both right about
each other in a lot of ways.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.283
- I think deep down they
know we're still close.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.184
- Yeah, I saw dad looking
at those ornaments

42:35.220 --> 42:36.853
you tried to hide
behind the tree.

42:36.888 --> 42:37.921
He didn't seem to mind.

42:37.956 --> 42:40.023
- Oh, it's just pigheadedness.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.691
- It's like bill and the store.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.393
He put money before good sense.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.695
We never should've opened
the other location.

42:46.565 --> 42:47.697
Carla knows.

42:47.732 --> 42:48.898
- Oh, wow.

42:48.934 --> 42:52.235
I guess everyone's up to speed
on all the family secrets.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.736
- Yeah, with one exception.

42:54.606 --> 42:57.206
What are you two
doing out altogether?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.041
- Aah.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.275
- Are you a date?

42:59.311 --> 43:01.444
- What? No.
- No, no.

43:01.479 --> 43:05.882
We, we just bumped into each
other and then we saw...

43:05.917 --> 43:06.749
Not a date.

43:06.785 --> 43:07.884
- Yeah, no.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.285
But we should get out of here.

43:09.321 --> 43:10.119
- Yes.

43:10.155 --> 43:11.321
Let's leave you to it.

43:11.356 --> 43:12.288
- Let you finish your...

43:12.324 --> 43:14.524
- And don't worry, your
secret's safe with us.

43:18.263 --> 43:22.065
- They came in together and
now they're leaving together.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.499
- Seems like a date to me.

43:23.535 --> 43:24.734
- Oh yes it does.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.903
(carla and arlene laughing)

43:26.938 --> 43:28.504
- I can't believe it.

43:28.540 --> 43:30.807
They kept their friendship
a secret for all these years

43:30.842 --> 43:32.809
without anybody knowing it.

43:32.844 --> 43:34.110
- Yeah.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.278
- I didn't think my
mother had it in her.

43:35.313 --> 43:36.212
- Yeah.

43:39.351 --> 43:41.017
- What, you're thinking about
your dad and the stores,

43:41.052 --> 43:43.353
aren't you?

43:43.388 --> 43:44.821
You know, maybe I can help.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.024
Put that mba to use.

43:48.059 --> 43:50.326
Sometimes it's good to have
an outside pair of eyes

43:50.362 --> 43:51.794
to take a look.

43:51.830 --> 43:54.263
- That is a very,
very nice offer,

43:54.299 --> 43:57.000
but my dad's head would
explode if he knew a scotto

43:57.035 --> 43:58.801
was looking at
the company books.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.438
- Well...

44:02.474 --> 44:05.308
Maybe we don't tell them.

44:06.211 --> 44:08.845
If our mothers can pull
off a little subterfuge,

44:08.880 --> 44:10.413
why can't you and I?

44:11.916 --> 44:14.050
- Meet me at the
store in the morning?

44:14.085 --> 44:14.984
- It's a da-

44:16.554 --> 44:18.454
an appointment, an appointment.

44:20.558 --> 44:21.357
- An appointment?

44:21.393 --> 44:22.058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:22.093 --> 44:26.295
("deck the halls" instrumental)

44:29.834 --> 44:31.401
- is this all of it?

44:31.436 --> 44:33.136
- What, you want
there to be more?

44:34.539 --> 44:36.873
I'll give it to my father,
he is well organized.

44:36.908 --> 44:38.975
- Well, let's get through
as much of it as we can

44:39.010 --> 44:41.177
before we have to get
back to the contest.

44:44.349 --> 44:47.250
(gentle piano music)

44:47.285 --> 44:50.353
come on, grab the
spreadsheet, dig in.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.355
- Right.

44:52.390 --> 44:55.491
(gentle piano music)

45:02.701 --> 45:05.868
(birds chirping)

45:05.904 --> 45:06.803
- what's wrong?

45:08.006 --> 45:11.074
- I think I figured out how to
make those icicles look like

45:11.109 --> 45:12.775
they're melting.

45:12.811 --> 45:13.710
But...

45:15.113 --> 45:16.446
- But what?

45:16.481 --> 45:17.780
- Means, we're going to
have to take them down

45:17.816 --> 45:19.248
and redo them.

45:19.284 --> 45:21.384
- No. Pop, we don't
have time for that.

45:21.419 --> 45:22.618
- No, we can do it.

45:22.654 --> 45:23.786
It'll only takes
a couple of hours.

45:23.822 --> 45:27.390
This needs to be perfect.
It needs to be my best work.

45:27.425 --> 45:30.693
It's what the people expect.
It's what I expect of myself.

45:30.729 --> 45:31.728
Nothing less.

45:32.664 --> 45:35.431
(curious music)

45:41.473 --> 45:43.372
- don't be too hard
on yourself, dad.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.208
Still got one more
day to make it sing.

45:45.243 --> 45:46.809
Plus we only have to be good
enough to get in the finals,

45:46.845 --> 45:48.077
right?

45:48.113 --> 45:49.278
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.990
- Well that doesn't
look like much.

46:01.025 --> 46:03.793
- Oh! (laughing)

46:03.828 --> 46:06.229
- well, that's because they
haven't turned it on yet.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.500
- And that's it for
today, everyone!

46:10.535 --> 46:13.736
We'll be picking the two
finalists tomorrow evening.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.472
So make your last day count.

46:16.508 --> 46:18.040
See y'all in the morning!

46:19.677 --> 46:20.676
- Woo!

46:20.712 --> 46:24.013
Haha! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:24.048 --> 46:24.847
Yes!

46:24.883 --> 46:26.015
(techno music blaring)

46:26.050 --> 46:26.949
ha!

46:26.985 --> 46:28.117
Woo!

46:28.153 --> 46:29.085
- Okay.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.787
- What'd I tell you
about the cross beams?

46:30.822 --> 46:32.789
You didn't want to have
them, but I was right again.

46:32.824 --> 46:33.790
Wade wins again!

46:35.460 --> 46:37.426
- Still think it
doesn't look like much?

46:40.131 --> 46:43.266
(gentle piano music)

46:47.906 --> 46:48.771
- you're up early.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.306
- Yeah.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.308
A friend just asked me to
go through their company's

46:52.343 --> 46:55.444
financials to see if I
could diagnose any problems,

46:55.480 --> 46:57.446
coming up with a few ideas.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.148
It's been kind of fun actually.

47:00.118 --> 47:02.952
You know, I feel like
I can genuinely help.

47:02.987 --> 47:03.519
It feels good.

47:03.555 --> 47:05.321
- Anthony, that's great.

47:05.356 --> 47:06.689
- Yeah.

47:06.724 --> 47:08.391
- Good to see that
glimmer in your eye again.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.892
- Thank you.

47:09.928 --> 47:10.827
- This last year, I've
seen how hard you've been

47:10.862 --> 47:11.928
on yourself.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.831
I was starting to worry
that maybe you were taking

47:14.866 --> 47:16.299
after your old man.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.634
- (laughs) what do
you mean by that?

47:18.670 --> 47:21.370
- Nothing. Nevermind.

47:21.406 --> 47:22.672
- No. Hey pop, come on.

47:22.707 --> 47:24.307
You can't just come...

47:24.342 --> 47:26.843
I mean, take a seat. Talk
to me. What do you mean?

47:32.183 --> 47:34.383
- Those first bright
nights contests,

47:35.253 --> 47:37.587
every time I won, first
thought I had was,

47:37.622 --> 47:40.189
"how am I going to
top myself again?"

47:40.225 --> 47:42.191
I got so in my head about it,

47:42.227 --> 47:44.126
it's why I couldn't
finish that year.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.698
I stopped competing completely
because I was embarrassed.

47:50.068 --> 47:52.235
I thought this year was
going to be different,

47:52.270 --> 47:55.238
but we are one day away and
I can't make heads or tails

47:55.273 --> 47:57.640
of what I want to do or
what I'm trying to do.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.244
I'm worried we're not
going to finish again.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.045
- Pop.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.016
Come on. We're going
to finish, okay?

48:08.052 --> 48:10.419
I promise, whatever it
takes we're going to finish.

48:13.258 --> 48:14.090
Okay?

48:18.062 --> 48:20.696
(bill singing)

48:28.239 --> 48:29.872
- morning, dad.

48:29.908 --> 48:30.907
- Oh, hey kiddo.

48:34.178 --> 48:35.244
Everything all right?

48:36.114 --> 48:37.013
- Yeah.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.648
Sarah and I are supposed
to go to this party.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.283
It's something that
should be good for us,

48:40.318 --> 48:42.118
for our business, but...

48:42.153 --> 48:43.753
- You'd rather not.

48:44.789 --> 48:47.490
- The last few weeks we
haven't felt like partners.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.492
It's been the sarah show.

48:49.527 --> 48:52.428
I can't tell if it's
because she's right

48:52.463 --> 48:54.130
and my design sense is way off,

48:54.165 --> 48:56.499
or if she just decided
that her opinion matters

48:56.534 --> 48:57.433
more than mine.

48:59.137 --> 49:01.637
- Well, now I understand
why you're so hesitant to

49:02.840 --> 49:04.907
give up your creative input.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.509
- I know how much this
contest means to you.

49:06.544 --> 49:08.077
I didn't want to
lead you astray.

49:08.112 --> 49:11.247
- (laughs) that's the last
thing I'd ever worry about,

49:11.282 --> 49:12.581
grace.

49:12.617 --> 49:15.418
- I guess I'm just
nervous to talk with sarah

49:15.453 --> 49:16.585
about all of this,

49:16.621 --> 49:19.021
because I know there's a chance
that this could be the end

49:19.057 --> 49:22.091
of everything we built together,
even worse, our friendship.

49:24.062 --> 49:24.994
- All right.

49:25.029 --> 49:29.098
It's your voice, your
creativity. (laughs)

49:29.133 --> 49:31.534
that's what makes
you so special.

49:31.569 --> 49:34.303
You can't let anyone tap
it down or drown it out.

49:34.339 --> 49:37.006
A real partner will value
all of your opinions,

49:38.509 --> 49:40.943
even if sometimes
it may be wrong.

49:40.979 --> 49:42.378
You know?

49:42.413 --> 49:43.946
Speaking of which,

49:43.982 --> 49:47.616
if you have any miracle
fixes for this deck house,

49:48.553 --> 49:50.052
now's the time.

49:50.088 --> 49:51.220
- It looks good, dad.

49:51.255 --> 49:54.190
- Good's not going to cut
it where wade is concerned.

49:55.426 --> 49:56.359
- Don't lose hope.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.828
- I'm not.

49:58.863 --> 50:01.197
I'm just looking at the
reality of the things.

50:03.835 --> 50:06.702
Anyway, I should get ready,
it's going to be a long day.

50:08.406 --> 50:09.839
Chin up.

50:09.874 --> 50:10.773
- Thanks.

50:11.542 --> 50:14.377
(cheerful music)

50:29.961 --> 50:33.262
("deck the halls" tune)

50:37.969 --> 50:40.336
- all right, load it out.

50:41.139 --> 50:42.038
Easy does it.

50:52.650 --> 50:55.551
- Everyone's acting like
we already lost weight.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.086
- Well, yeah, but I mean...

50:59.857 --> 51:01.290
Step into my office.

51:05.196 --> 51:06.829
(grace sighs)

51:06.864 --> 51:09.965
look, based on where both
of our houses are at,

51:10.001 --> 51:12.601
neither one of them is going
to take us into the finals.

51:13.738 --> 51:16.138
- Yeah, but we just need one
of us to get to the finals,

51:16.174 --> 51:17.673
and then we've got a shot.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.175
- True.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.911
- I have an idea of how
we could do this, but...

51:21.946 --> 51:22.812
- What?

51:28.319 --> 51:28.984
Wow, that...

51:29.020 --> 51:31.220
That's beautiful. You drew that?

51:32.390 --> 51:34.490
But that's way more
than a day's work.

51:34.525 --> 51:36.292
- Yeah, for three people it is,

51:36.327 --> 51:38.894
but with seven, we
could pull it off.

51:40.298 --> 51:42.431
- Where you going to get
these extra four people?

51:44.635 --> 51:47.670
(mischievous tones)

51:48.806 --> 51:49.705
no.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.207
My family?

51:51.242 --> 51:52.475
- Well, you just said that
neither one of our houses

51:52.510 --> 51:54.276
are good enough to
make it to the finals.

51:54.312 --> 51:56.645
But if our families
work together,

51:56.681 --> 51:59.115
maybe we could bring out
the best in each other.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.319
- Or if the last 20 years
have been any indication,

52:03.354 --> 52:05.020
maybe we'll bring out the worst.

52:05.957 --> 52:08.624
- Did you bump your head
on the ice or something?

52:08.659 --> 52:11.393
I would rather hang
up the lights for good

52:11.429 --> 52:13.062
than work with bill ryan again.

52:13.097 --> 52:14.563
- You know what?

52:14.599 --> 52:16.465
If partnering up with him
is a more painful thought

52:16.501 --> 52:19.001
than letting wade and
his carnival light show

52:19.036 --> 52:22.271
walk away with the
title, then fine, don't.

52:23.341 --> 52:25.574
But if decorating means
as much as I know it does

52:25.610 --> 52:29.044
to you, then temporarily
putting aside your pride,

52:30.014 --> 52:31.380
it's a small price to pay.

52:33.551 --> 52:36.051
Look, I said we'd do
whatever it takes to finish,

52:37.188 --> 52:38.521
whatever it takes.

52:40.024 --> 52:41.223
This is what it takes.

52:43.461 --> 52:44.827
- Well, what does bill say?

52:45.630 --> 52:47.096
- Bill?

52:47.131 --> 52:48.063
He's...

52:48.099 --> 52:49.031
- Open to it.

52:50.134 --> 52:51.333
- Really?

52:51.369 --> 52:53.035
- Well he didn't say no.

52:53.070 --> 52:53.903
- Hm.

52:55.072 --> 52:56.138
The kids are right.

52:56.174 --> 52:57.940
There's no way our two
houses are going to make it

52:57.975 --> 52:58.974
to the finals.

52:59.911 --> 53:01.110
- Okay.

53:01.145 --> 53:03.679
So we work together,
temporarily,

53:03.714 --> 53:05.581
just so we have a better chance.

53:05.616 --> 53:06.282
- All right.

53:06.317 --> 53:08.517
But if that happens and we win,

53:08.553 --> 53:11.520
we split the contract and
the money, 50/50, okay?

53:17.161 --> 53:18.561
- [frank] let's go to work.

53:18.596 --> 53:19.962
- [bill] let's.

53:19.997 --> 53:23.032
- You and the scottos want
to partner up. Really?

53:23.067 --> 53:24.233
- Yeah, exactly.

53:24.268 --> 53:27.870
We want to join forces and work
on just this house together.

53:27.905 --> 53:29.772
- Well, there's nothing in the
competition agreement saying

53:29.807 --> 53:32.141
that you can't decorate
one house together,

53:32.176 --> 53:34.310
but I do want to run
it by the other teams.

53:34.345 --> 53:35.711
- Oh, we asked.

53:35.746 --> 53:36.979
Mistletoe designs
already signed off on it.

53:37.014 --> 53:37.646
- What about wade?

53:37.682 --> 53:39.615
- They have my full support.

53:41.018 --> 53:41.984
Can't wait to see
what rabbit hole

53:42.019 --> 53:44.386
their collective
imaginations take them down.

53:44.422 --> 53:46.622
- Since their team now
consists of seven people,

53:46.657 --> 53:49.725
I think it only fair that
mistletoe designs and glowscapes

53:49.760 --> 53:50.659
add to theirs.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.661
- Mm. I feel good about
our current number.

53:52.697 --> 53:55.231
More people would
feel unnecessary.

53:55.266 --> 53:57.299
(wendy and wade laughing)

53:57.335 --> 53:59.969
- I'll let mistletoe designs
know where things stand.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.974
You have less than half a day.

54:05.009 --> 54:08.577
If your house isn't
finished by 6:00 pm tonight,

54:08.613 --> 54:10.279
you're both disqualified.

54:10.314 --> 54:11.280
- Yep. Understood.

54:14.385 --> 54:15.284
- So?

54:15.319 --> 54:16.352
- We got the sign-off.

54:16.387 --> 54:18.420
- Okay. Let's see those designs.

54:18.456 --> 54:19.555
- She's really good, frank.

54:19.590 --> 54:23.292
My designs have been uninspired
for a long time, but...

54:23.327 --> 54:25.327
Well, she's got a good eye.

54:26.697 --> 54:28.664
- These are all really great.

54:28.699 --> 54:31.433
- Okay. Well where
do you want us?

54:32.536 --> 54:35.037
- I want two people on the
roof, two on the ground.

54:35.072 --> 54:36.438
Knock this out real quick.

54:36.474 --> 54:37.706
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

54:37.742 --> 54:38.474
- [tony] I'll hit the roof.
- Come on.

54:39.243 --> 54:42.111
(cheerful music)

54:47.351 --> 54:51.353
- where do you want this one?
- Right over there.

54:54.425 --> 54:55.557
- I think we're pulling it off.

54:55.593 --> 54:58.494
- I had no worries whatsoever.

54:58.529 --> 55:00.996
Okay, fine. It was
a christmas miracle.

55:01.032 --> 55:03.465
- Hopefully it's enough
to get us in the finals.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.807
- Let's give another
big round of applause

55:11.842 --> 55:13.809
to our four teams!

55:13.844 --> 55:16.011
They all did such incredible
work, didn't they?

55:16.047 --> 55:17.212
Woo!

55:17.248 --> 55:18.747
(crowd applauding)

55:18.783 --> 55:21.917
but we all know that only
two teams will be moving on

55:21.952 --> 55:24.053
to compete in the finals.

55:24.088 --> 55:27.823
Our first bright
nights finalist is...

55:27.858 --> 55:28.757
Glowscapes!

55:28.793 --> 55:30.059
- Yes!

55:30.094 --> 55:32.895
Come on! Yeah! Cross
beams! Cross beams!

55:32.930 --> 55:35.064
And competing against glowscapes

55:35.099 --> 55:38.734
in our 15th annual bright
nights finals is...

55:39.904 --> 55:43.339
The combined team of good
tidings and deck the halls!

55:43.374 --> 55:47.176
(cheering and clapping)

55:47.211 --> 55:51.347
hope to see you all back for
the finals in two nights time.

55:51.382 --> 55:53.716
Good night, everyone! Woo!

55:53.751 --> 55:54.783
(crowd clapping)
- all right.

55:54.819 --> 55:56.018
Congratulations!

55:56.053 --> 55:57.186
- We just have to
do it one more time.

55:57.221 --> 55:58.354
We got this.

55:58.389 --> 55:59.955
- Another step
closer to $50,000.

55:59.990 --> 56:02.358
- See, he's always
talking about the money.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.093
- Hey, hey, come on, dad.

56:04.128 --> 56:06.695
- At least I'm not so
self-centered that I have to be

56:06.731 --> 56:08.564
perfect at everything I do.

56:08.599 --> 56:09.398
- Dad.

56:09.433 --> 56:10.632
- No, no, no.

56:10.668 --> 56:11.467
Rather confront the
fact that you can't stay

56:11.502 --> 56:13.302
out of your own way.

56:13.337 --> 56:16.472
He blew up our partnership,
our friendship.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.474
- The work has always
come first for me, bill.

56:18.509 --> 56:20.542
It always has and
it always will.

56:20.578 --> 56:22.544
You never understood that.

56:22.580 --> 56:26.048
- What I understood
all too well back then

56:26.083 --> 56:29.284
was that your perfectionism
was never about the jobs,

56:29.320 --> 56:32.054
it was all about
satisfying your own ego.

56:32.089 --> 56:33.455
Decorating was never
about other people,

56:33.491 --> 56:36.291
it was always about you,
making yourself happy.

56:36.327 --> 56:37.493
- Okay, come on. Let's cool it.

56:37.528 --> 56:38.994
- Yeah. It's been a long day.

56:39.029 --> 56:41.063
Let's just all go home
before you say something

56:41.098 --> 56:42.631
you can't take back, okay?

56:44.435 --> 56:45.801
- A little late for that.

56:48.172 --> 56:51.073
- [grace] dad, come on.

56:58.182 --> 56:59.548
Ey

56:59.583 --> 57:00.916
- didn't wrestle.

57:00.951 --> 57:03.485
- Well, tomorrow is another day.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.053
- Do we need to reexplain

57:05.089 --> 57:06.722
- the concept of

57:06.757 --> 57:08.157
- naughty or nice to them?

57:08.192 --> 57:09.425
- Couldn't hurt.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.593
So do you have any
plans for this evening?

57:11.629 --> 57:12.861
- Yeah, I'm heading to richmond.

57:12.897 --> 57:16.398
My business partner and I got
invited to this holiday party

57:16.434 --> 57:18.200
these producers are throwing.

57:18.235 --> 57:20.602
- And what do these
producers produce?

57:20.638 --> 57:21.870
- Reality tv.

57:22.973 --> 57:26.575
They approached us about
doing a home staging show

57:26.610 --> 57:28.410
and sarah and I
would be the hosts.

57:29.980 --> 57:32.881
- How am I just hearing
about this? That's amazing.

57:35.286 --> 57:38.387
Well, hopefully we can keep
them on their best behavior

57:38.422 --> 57:39.455
tomorrow.

57:39.490 --> 57:40.856
- (laughs) yeah, good luck.

57:42.393 --> 57:43.926
- Uh...

57:43.961 --> 57:45.093
Night
- night, yep

57:50.734 --> 57:53.068
(sighs)

57:53.103 --> 57:53.936
- what's wrong?

57:53.971 --> 57:55.604
- My mom has my car keys.

57:57.174 --> 57:58.340
- Really?

57:58.375 --> 57:59.908
- Yeah, she borrowed them to
get an extra pair of gloves

57:59.944 --> 58:01.810
and I forgot to
get the keys back.

58:01.846 --> 58:04.746
- Jeez. That's too bad.

58:04.782 --> 58:05.614
- Yeah.

58:08.752 --> 58:11.153
- Well. Have a great night.

58:11.188 --> 58:12.588
- Oh, tony!

58:12.623 --> 58:13.455
- What?

58:14.959 --> 58:16.124
I'm just kidding.

58:17.628 --> 58:19.127
Come on, I'll give you a ride,

58:19.163 --> 58:21.263
but this really
does make a square.

58:22.099 --> 58:22.965
- Totally.

58:25.369 --> 58:27.736
(grace laughs)

58:27.771 --> 58:31.807
("deck the halls" instrumental)

58:32.710 --> 58:35.010
- it's a good thing
you had that extra key.

58:35.045 --> 58:37.112
- A girl scout always
has a backup plan.

58:38.616 --> 58:41.283
- You sure you want me
to come to this party?

58:41.318 --> 58:43.285
I'm not exactly dressed for it.

58:43.320 --> 58:44.152
- You drove all this way,

58:44.188 --> 58:45.854
let me at least buy
you a free drink

58:45.890 --> 58:48.357
and fill you up on
canapes for the trouble.

58:48.392 --> 58:50.325
- You've got a nice place.

58:50.361 --> 58:53.495
It's almost like you
stage homes for a living.

58:53.531 --> 58:54.796
- Like it?

58:54.832 --> 58:56.098
- Yeah, it's...

58:59.737 --> 59:01.270
It's beautiful.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.939
(gentle piano music)

59:03.974 --> 59:06.775
- I didn't bring any party
clothes to my parent's house,

59:06.810 --> 59:08.176
so thanks for the pit stop.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.313
Shall we?

59:11.348 --> 59:12.581
- Let's do it.

59:18.489 --> 59:21.356
- I just love richmond
during the christmas time.

59:21.392 --> 59:22.691
- Yeah.

59:22.726 --> 59:23.825
It's pretty special.

59:25.262 --> 59:26.562
- Actually, the bar's
not too far from here.

59:26.597 --> 59:28.196
Do you want to just walk?

59:28.232 --> 59:29.197
- I'd love to.

59:30.267 --> 59:31.733
Ooh! Ooh!
- Aah!

59:31.769 --> 59:32.534
(laughing)

59:32.570 --> 59:33.835
are you okay?

59:33.871 --> 59:35.237
- Yeah.

59:35.272 --> 59:36.738
- Wow, for a hockey player,

59:36.774 --> 59:38.774
you aren't so
graceful on the ice.

59:42.913 --> 59:43.845
- There she is.

59:44.715 --> 59:45.614
- Hi.

59:46.784 --> 59:47.983
- Don't worry about me.

59:48.018 --> 59:50.085
You do your thing
and I'll go mingle.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.019
- Okay.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.623
- Hey henry, how are you guys?

59:55.726 --> 59:57.893
- Our lustrous producer was
just asking us what the show

59:57.928 --> 59:59.127
might be like.

59:59.163 --> 1:00:02.598
- Well, we haven't had time
to discuss the direction yet,

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:04.099
but we're-

1:00:04.134 --> 1:00:05.033
- but the show should follow
us meeting our clients

1:00:05.069 --> 1:00:07.169
and seeing their houses
for the first time,

1:00:07.204 --> 1:00:09.404
how we come up with the
design and the layouts,

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.239
and you can give them
all those little details

1:00:11.275 --> 1:00:13.408
about the furniture
you love to talk about.

1:00:13.444 --> 1:00:17.045
And we can end each episode
with the houses being sold

1:00:17.081 --> 1:00:18.947
for over asking, of course.

1:00:18.983 --> 1:00:19.948
(henry laughs)

1:00:19.984 --> 1:00:21.717
- yeah, exactly.

1:00:21.752 --> 1:00:23.785
- See, whole idea sells itself.

1:00:23.821 --> 1:00:25.621
- It's got a perfectly
built-in structure.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:26.655
It's really smart.

1:00:27.591 --> 1:00:28.724
Can you excuse me for a minute?

1:00:28.759 --> 1:00:30.192
Don't go. I'll be right back.

1:00:33.397 --> 1:00:36.298
- Did you hear that?
He loved our idea.

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:39.401
The dynamic duo strikes again.

1:00:39.436 --> 1:00:40.869
- Okay, about that,

1:00:40.904 --> 1:00:43.739
I feel like we haven't
been much of a duo lately.

1:00:44.942 --> 1:00:47.309
It feels more like
I'm your plus one.

1:00:47.344 --> 1:00:48.076
- What?

1:00:48.112 --> 1:00:49.144
How do you mean?

1:00:49.179 --> 1:00:51.446
- Oh, you just been...

1:00:52.549 --> 1:00:56.051
Really dismissive of my
ideas the past few months,

1:00:56.086 --> 1:00:58.820
like my opinion doesn't seem
to matter to you anymore.

1:00:58.856 --> 1:01:01.823
- Grace, your
opinion matters to me

1:01:01.859 --> 1:01:03.825
when you stand behind it.

1:01:03.861 --> 1:01:05.060
- What?

1:01:05.095 --> 1:01:06.762
- If you really
believed in an idea,

1:01:06.797 --> 1:01:08.997
then you need to push back.

1:01:09.033 --> 1:01:10.332
But when you don't say anything,

1:01:10.367 --> 1:01:12.801
I have to assume
we're in agreement.

1:01:12.836 --> 1:01:14.269
I can't read your mind.

1:01:14.304 --> 1:01:16.638
- Yeah, but you just
dismissed what I had to say

1:01:16.674 --> 1:01:18.106
in front of henry a second ago.

1:01:18.142 --> 1:01:20.375
I'm not even sure you
know you're doing it.

1:01:21.445 --> 1:01:24.112
- Maybe this isn't the best
place for us to be having

1:01:24.148 --> 1:01:25.280
this conversation.

1:01:26.216 --> 1:01:27.282
- Yeah, you're right.

1:01:28.218 --> 1:01:29.051
I should go.

1:01:36.460 --> 1:01:40.495
- Excuse me.

1:01:40.531 --> 1:01:41.329
Hey.

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:42.798
- Can we go?

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:45.267
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, thanks.

1:01:50.974 --> 1:01:53.475
- Well, I think it's good
that you said something,

1:01:53.510 --> 1:01:56.044
got it off your mind before
your business relationship

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.479
poisoned your friendship.

1:02:00.584 --> 1:02:01.483
There you go.

1:02:01.518 --> 1:02:02.451
- Thank you so much. Yah!

1:02:02.486 --> 1:02:03.952
- I don't know how they do that.

1:02:03.987 --> 1:02:06.054
You could not pay me
enough money to sing

1:02:06.090 --> 1:02:07.255
in front of people.

1:02:07.291 --> 1:02:10.225
- Well, you played hockey in
front of thousands of people

1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:12.360
but you think singing is scary.

1:02:12.396 --> 1:02:15.163
- You obviously have
not heard me sing.

1:02:15.199 --> 1:02:16.631
- (laughing) you're
right. You're right.

1:02:16.667 --> 1:02:17.733
But...

1:02:17.768 --> 1:02:19.301
Come on. It can't be that bad.

1:02:20.170 --> 1:02:21.369
- Ooh.

1:02:21.405 --> 1:02:23.472
- When was the last
time you tried?

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:25.674
- Um.

1:02:27.077 --> 1:02:30.412
Well, it wasn't the
last time, but...

1:02:30.447 --> 1:02:33.148
This one christmas,

1:02:33.183 --> 1:02:35.717
my parents took maria
and I to tuscany.

1:02:35.753 --> 1:02:38.587
Actually it was right after
the falling out with your dad.

1:02:38.622 --> 1:02:41.723
And my cousins, they have
this tradition where they

1:02:41.759 --> 1:02:43.725
go through the
neighborhood door to door,

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:47.929
just belting out italian
christmas carols, right?

1:02:47.965 --> 1:02:50.732
And then the neighbors come
out and they give you candy

1:02:50.768 --> 1:02:52.701
and sweets for your trouble.

1:02:53.537 --> 1:02:54.402
- That sounds like fun.

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:55.504
- Yeah,

1:02:55.539 --> 1:02:56.404
it is.

1:02:57.307 --> 1:02:59.708
But I think there's
something about singing

1:02:59.743 --> 1:03:01.176
in a foreign language,

1:03:01.211 --> 1:03:03.044
just makes you feel
less self-conscious,

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:05.013
because we barely
knew any italian,

1:03:05.048 --> 1:03:07.549
and my cousins didn't
know any english,

1:03:07.584 --> 1:03:10.652
but somehow it just, it
brought us closer together.

1:03:11.755 --> 1:03:15.190
I think mutual embarrassment
kind of tears down walls,

1:03:15.225 --> 1:03:16.024
if that makes sense.

1:03:16.059 --> 1:03:16.925
- Right. Yes.

1:03:18.162 --> 1:03:19.861
- Ya know what? I have an idea.

1:03:20.898 --> 1:03:22.397
Come on.

1:03:22.432 --> 1:03:23.598
- Okay.

1:03:23.634 --> 1:03:28.270
("deck the halls"
guitar instrumental)

1:03:52.095 --> 1:03:53.962
- what is that?

1:03:53.997 --> 1:03:57.833
♪ round yon virgin
mother and child ♪

1:03:57.868 --> 1:04:02.304
(singing "silent
night" in italian)

1:04:16.687 --> 1:04:17.586
- aww.

1:04:17.621 --> 1:04:18.653
- Tone, what are you doing?

1:04:18.689 --> 1:04:19.354
(grace laughs)

1:04:19.389 --> 1:04:21.489
- I'm embarrassing myself, pop.

1:04:21.525 --> 1:04:22.324
(laughing)

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:23.792
- let's come inside.

1:04:23.827 --> 1:04:26.027
We have plenty of vino
brulee, mom made struffoli.

1:04:26.063 --> 1:04:27.028
Let's get out of the cold.

1:04:27.064 --> 1:04:28.029
- No, no, no.

1:04:28.065 --> 1:04:29.164
Actually, we were hoping
that you would join us

1:04:29.199 --> 1:04:30.131
for another stop.

1:04:33.303 --> 1:04:37.739
(singing "silent
night" in italian)

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:53.421

(singing "silent

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:17.746
- oh!

1:05:17.781 --> 1:05:20.048
That was beautiful!

1:05:20.083 --> 1:05:21.616
Come in. Come in.

1:05:31.528 --> 1:05:33.028
- Frank?

1:05:33.063 --> 1:05:36.197
(gentle piano music)

1:05:39.469 --> 1:05:41.069
- you were right, frank.

1:05:42.172 --> 1:05:45.240
I put profit ahead of all the
work that we did together.

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:48.810
Instead of asking
you how you felt,

1:05:48.845 --> 1:05:51.880
I pushed you into a place that
made you feel uncomfortable.

1:05:55.218 --> 1:05:57.886
- Well, despite all that,

1:05:58.755 --> 1:06:00.622
I know that you just
wanted to get the most

1:06:00.657 --> 1:06:01.856
out of working together.

1:06:03.327 --> 1:06:08.229
My stubbornness and my ego
kept me from seeing that.

1:06:08.532 --> 1:06:09.331
- Yeah.

1:06:10.434 --> 1:06:13.168
Remember joking about our
kids being together someday?

1:06:14.271 --> 1:06:17.539
- Well, if we weren't so
wrapped up in holding grudges,

1:06:17.574 --> 1:06:19.407
maybe it would have
happened sooner.

1:06:25.949 --> 1:06:27.015
I'm sorry, bill.

1:06:29.853 --> 1:06:32.020
- Me too, frank. Me too.

1:06:47.704 --> 1:06:50.071
Same rules apply as before.

1:06:50.107 --> 1:06:53.742
All we're asking for is
your most ambitious displays

1:06:53.777 --> 1:06:55.577
of your lives!

1:06:55.612 --> 1:06:58.046
You may start your sleighs...

1:06:58.081 --> 1:06:59.147
Now!

1:07:01.151 --> 1:07:02.684
- Okay.

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:03.518
- Okay.

1:07:03.553 --> 1:07:05.420
So what's the plan?

1:07:05.455 --> 1:07:07.889
- Well, actually your story
about Italy got me thinking

1:07:07.924 --> 1:07:10.025
about other italian
christmas traditions.

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:13.128
So I did some research and
I found something I think

1:07:13.163 --> 1:07:16.398
to be pretty interesting
and completely unexpected.

1:07:17.934 --> 1:07:19.467
- A ceppo.

1:07:19.503 --> 1:07:22.370
My grandparents always had a
tree of light at christmas.

1:07:22.406 --> 1:07:24.472
- And it can also
mean yule log, right?

1:07:24.508 --> 1:07:25.940
- Yes.

1:07:25.976 --> 1:07:27.175
The tradition is that you
cut a trunk of the tree

1:07:27.210 --> 1:07:30.478
and you burn the log in the
fireplace on christmas night.

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:32.647
And then the kids of the family,

1:07:32.682 --> 1:07:35.784
they hit the burning embers
till the sparks fly up

1:07:35.819 --> 1:07:37.318
into the air,

1:07:37.354 --> 1:07:39.621
symbolizing the hopes of the
family for the coming year.

1:07:41.191 --> 1:07:42.557
- Can we do it in two days?

1:07:42.592 --> 1:07:44.993
- Well, give it a
detailed design,

1:07:45.028 --> 1:07:48.096
no one second guessing
each other, complete focus

1:07:48.131 --> 1:07:51.299
and every available family
member lending a hand.

1:07:52.803 --> 1:07:53.768
Maybe.

1:07:53.804 --> 1:07:55.670
(grace laughs)

1:07:55.705 --> 1:07:56.371
- okay.

1:07:56.406 --> 1:07:57.405
- Where do you want me to start?

1:07:58.809 --> 1:08:01.009
- The lights tony and
grace are laying in,

1:08:01.044 --> 1:08:03.745
are going to lead to the
second tier of the ceppo.

1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:05.680
- Uh huh. It's
going to look great.

1:08:05.715 --> 1:08:06.981
- I think so.
- Yep.

1:08:08.885 --> 1:08:09.918
Hey grace.
- Hey.

1:08:11.488 --> 1:08:13.655
- I just want to thank you.

1:08:13.690 --> 1:08:14.656
- For what?

1:08:16.026 --> 1:08:17.992
- For helping me to
realize why I got

1:08:18.028 --> 1:08:21.129
into the decorating
business in the first place.

1:08:21.164 --> 1:08:23.064
Doing this with the
people you love,

1:08:23.967 --> 1:08:26.401
trying to bring a little
joy into the world.

1:08:27.504 --> 1:08:30.605
That should have always been
more than enough, you know?

1:08:32.576 --> 1:08:37.045
- Three, two, one,
everybody stop!

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:38.880
Tomorrow's the big day.

1:08:38.915 --> 1:08:41.716
You'll have a few extra
hours to get every light,

1:08:41.751 --> 1:08:43.852
bow and bow in its place.

1:08:45.489 --> 1:08:47.822
- Let's see how this
looks, shall we?

1:08:47.858 --> 1:08:51.326
("jingle bells" blaring)

1:09:06.176 --> 1:09:07.041
boom.

1:09:08.678 --> 1:09:09.978
Yeah.

1:09:10.013 --> 1:09:11.379
- Whoa.

1:09:11.414 --> 1:09:12.313
That was...

1:09:13.416 --> 1:09:14.382
- Stunning.

1:09:14.451 --> 1:09:16.484
- Yeah, if their goal is
to give people headache

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.553
and blurred vision, then
mission accomplished,

1:09:18.588 --> 1:09:20.121
otherwise I'm not impressed.

1:09:22.959 --> 1:09:24.058
- All right. Come on.

1:09:25.896 --> 1:09:27.896
(grace and tony laugh)

1:09:27.931 --> 1:09:28.930
- I think...

1:09:28.965 --> 1:09:29.898
I think we're coming along.

1:09:29.933 --> 1:09:32.333
- Yeah, we might even finish.

1:09:32.369 --> 1:09:33.568
- We'd better.

1:09:33.603 --> 1:09:35.904
I haven't been this exhausted
since two-a-days in college.

1:09:35.939 --> 1:09:39.841
- Look, if you want to rest up
for tomorrow, I totally get.

1:09:39.876 --> 1:09:41.943
- No, it's better to go over
things with your dad sooner

1:09:41.978 --> 1:09:42.911
rather than later.

1:09:42.946 --> 1:09:44.212
I'll see you at the house?

1:09:44.247 --> 1:09:45.213
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:09:46.983 --> 1:09:48.750
- I don't know what
grace told you exactly,

1:09:48.785 --> 1:09:51.119
but any financial issues
we have with the store,

1:09:51.154 --> 1:09:51.819
I can handle.

1:09:51.855 --> 1:09:54.055
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1:09:54.090 --> 1:09:55.590
After looking into your records,

1:09:55.625 --> 1:09:58.059
it seems like you guys
are a little bit behind-

1:09:58.094 --> 1:10:00.695
- whoa, whoa, whoa. You
let him look at my records?

1:10:00.730 --> 1:10:03.798
- Dad, just listen.

1:10:03.833 --> 1:10:04.799
- Look.

1:10:04.834 --> 1:10:07.468
The quickest way to ease
your monthly cash losses

1:10:07.504 --> 1:10:09.270
would be to purchase
the building that houses

1:10:09.306 --> 1:10:10.405
your midlothian store.

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.875
- Ha! That's your big idea?

1:10:13.910 --> 1:10:15.410
You want me to spend more money?

1:10:15.445 --> 1:10:16.411
- Actually, yes.

1:10:16.479 --> 1:10:18.947
I looked into it and the
lease holding companies

1:10:18.982 --> 1:10:21.482
are already unloaded a few
of their buildings this year

1:10:21.518 --> 1:10:22.617
below cost.

1:10:22.652 --> 1:10:24.552
They might welcome the
opportunity to get another one

1:10:24.588 --> 1:10:26.087
off the books.

1:10:26.122 --> 1:10:28.623
You'd use your inventory, which
you already own obviously,

1:10:28.658 --> 1:10:30.258
as collateral for the loan.

1:10:30.293 --> 1:10:31.793
Mr. Ryan, you do this,
you're going to save

1:10:31.828 --> 1:10:33.995
about $2,000 a month.

1:10:34.030 --> 1:10:36.064
- Which brings us
closer to even.

1:10:36.099 --> 1:10:36.965
- Exactly.

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.833
And you're putting
your money into equity,

1:10:38.868 --> 1:10:40.401
which gives you
some flexibility,

1:10:40.437 --> 1:10:42.570
if business doesn't
pick up right away.

1:10:42.606 --> 1:10:44.305
Now your marketing,

1:10:44.341 --> 1:10:47.842
which at the moment
is inventory focused.

1:10:47.877 --> 1:10:50.078
It should really be about
letting customers know

1:10:50.113 --> 1:10:51.913
what separates
you from the pack,

1:10:51.948 --> 1:10:54.148
your expertise in refurbishing.

1:10:54.184 --> 1:10:56.584
- Yeah, the part of the
business that you love, dad.

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:58.920
- Your competition in the
area either doesn't offer

1:10:58.955 --> 1:11:01.189
that service or they don't
have anywhere near the amount

1:11:01.224 --> 1:11:03.191
of years of expertise
that you do.

1:11:03.226 --> 1:11:06.261
It's low overhead.
It's high return.

1:11:06.296 --> 1:11:07.862
You're a craftsman

1:11:07.897 --> 1:11:09.831
and your customers
need to know that.

1:11:09.866 --> 1:11:10.965
- That's why people
came to your business

1:11:11.001 --> 1:11:12.967
in the first place.

1:11:13.003 --> 1:11:15.970
You're skilled to be able
to take a piece of furniture

1:11:16.006 --> 1:11:18.206
and breathe new life into it.

1:11:18.241 --> 1:11:19.774
- You see that? (laughs)

1:11:19.809 --> 1:11:23.044
(ryan's furniture, where what's
old can we made new again?(

1:11:23.079 --> 1:11:23.878
I like that.

1:11:23.913 --> 1:11:25.513
- Catchy.

1:11:25.548 --> 1:11:27.815
- Now I know this
is a lot to chew on,

1:11:27.851 --> 1:11:30.218
but I think these strategies
could really help put you

1:11:30.253 --> 1:11:32.053
in a position of success.

1:11:32.088 --> 1:11:34.856
- Well, if these numbers
are what they appear to be,

1:11:34.891 --> 1:11:37.592
then what you're saying is...

1:11:38.695 --> 1:11:40.128
Interesting.

1:11:40.163 --> 1:11:41.462
- I can send you the files.

1:11:41.498 --> 1:11:43.498
You can check the
numbers yourself.

1:11:43.533 --> 1:11:45.166
Mr. Ryan...

1:11:45.201 --> 1:11:46.334
I just wanted to help.

1:11:50.206 --> 1:11:52.540
(men laugh)

1:12:01.184 --> 1:12:03.418
- this should be enough
I think, don't you?

1:12:03.453 --> 1:12:07.055
(cheerful christmas tune)

1:12:09.092 --> 1:12:11.326
- hey, pop. Be careful, will ya?

1:12:11.361 --> 1:12:12.694
- Yes, I will.

1:12:14.464 --> 1:12:15.763
- How's it look?

1:12:15.799 --> 1:12:16.664
- Great.

1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:19.067
Hey, there's somebody
here to see you.

1:12:19.102 --> 1:12:20.068
- Oh, yeah? Who?

1:12:24.307 --> 1:12:25.206
Hey.

1:12:26.209 --> 1:12:28.543
- The decorations look amazing.

1:12:28.578 --> 1:12:29.243
- Thanks.

1:12:29.279 --> 1:12:31.012
We still have a long way to go.

1:12:31.948 --> 1:12:33.748
You didn't have to come
all the way out here,

1:12:33.783 --> 1:12:35.583
you could have just called.

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:37.719
- Somehow a phone call
didn't seem right.

1:12:38.855 --> 1:12:41.956
Remember how hideous our
mount kellogg dorm room was?

1:12:41.991 --> 1:12:44.425
- Yeah, who could forget
those baby blue walls.

1:12:45.628 --> 1:12:47.095
- But we made it work,

1:12:47.130 --> 1:12:49.097
turned it into a spot they
would take applicants by

1:12:49.132 --> 1:12:50.264
on the tour.

1:12:50.300 --> 1:12:52.533
Show them how comfy
dorm life was.

1:12:52.569 --> 1:12:54.369
- Our first home staging.

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:57.372
- Where our friendship
and our partnership began.

1:12:59.175 --> 1:13:01.476
I'm really sorry, grace.

1:13:01.511 --> 1:13:02.577
- Oh, sarah, you don't-

1:13:02.612 --> 1:13:04.145
- as soon as the possibility
of a show came around,

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:05.646
I just...

1:13:05.682 --> 1:13:07.048
Took over.

1:13:07.083 --> 1:13:08.983
I got so excited.

1:13:09.018 --> 1:13:10.785
And the more excited I got,

1:13:10.820 --> 1:13:13.154
the more I wanted to
control everything.

1:13:13.189 --> 1:13:14.622
It was not cool.

1:13:15.658 --> 1:13:17.725
And I completely understand
if you want to start

1:13:17.761 --> 1:13:18.726
your own thing.

1:13:19.963 --> 1:13:22.163
- Whether or not the
show becomes a reality,

1:13:22.198 --> 1:13:25.633
there is no one else I'd
rather be doing this with.

1:13:25.668 --> 1:13:28.469
I'd be 50% less
dynamic without you.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.975
- Friendship first,
business partner second.

1:13:34.010 --> 1:13:34.942
- You got it.

1:13:36.012 --> 1:13:36.944
Aww.

1:13:41.718 --> 1:13:44.452
- I'd stay and help,
but I got to get back.

1:13:44.487 --> 1:13:46.454
Promised my folks I'd
meet them for dinner.

1:13:46.489 --> 1:13:49.924
- I'll send them my
love. Happy holidays.

1:13:50.794 --> 1:13:51.826
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:13:53.029 --> 1:13:55.129
(sighs)

1:13:56.466 --> 1:13:58.833
- I guess that went well.

1:13:58.868 --> 1:14:00.435
- It did actually.

1:14:00.470 --> 1:14:02.036
(frank yells)

1:14:02.071 --> 1:14:03.104
- dad!

1:14:03.139 --> 1:14:03.938
Dad.

1:14:03.973 --> 1:14:05.039
(frank groans)

1:14:05.074 --> 1:14:06.541
don't move him. Don't move him.

1:14:06.576 --> 1:14:07.475
- Okay. Okay. Are you all right?

1:14:08.378 --> 1:14:09.343
(frank groaning)

1:14:09.379 --> 1:14:10.878
- [911 operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

1:14:10.914 --> 1:14:12.680
- Yeah, we need an
ambulance right away.

1:14:14.684 --> 1:14:15.450
- Okay.

1:14:15.485 --> 1:14:16.717
Okay.

1:14:16.753 --> 1:14:18.753
Yeah. I'll let them know. Okay.

1:14:21.024 --> 1:14:23.491
That was mom. Dad's
going to be fine.

1:14:23.526 --> 1:14:25.726
He fractured his clavicle
and had the wind knocked

1:14:25.762 --> 1:14:27.495
out of him, but no broken ribs.

1:14:28.531 --> 1:14:30.198
- The bright nights committee
said that the deadline

1:14:30.233 --> 1:14:31.132
still stands.

1:14:32.535 --> 1:14:34.635
- We've lost a lot of time.

1:14:34.671 --> 1:14:36.237
- Look, we all know what
we need to accomplish

1:14:36.272 --> 1:14:38.639
and we can only get it
done if we work in harmony

1:14:38.675 --> 1:14:40.107
as one unit,

1:14:40.910 --> 1:14:42.243
as family.

1:14:42.278 --> 1:14:43.177
- Yep.

1:14:44.747 --> 1:14:46.514
- We have to finish
this for frank.

1:14:48.751 --> 1:14:51.719
- Two minutes everyone,
two minutes to show time!

1:14:52.789 --> 1:14:54.188
- Are we good?

1:14:54.224 --> 1:14:55.189
- I think so. I think so.

1:14:55.225 --> 1:14:57.024
- Maybe we should just
check the connections,

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:57.825
just to be sure.

1:14:57.861 --> 1:14:59.060
- Good idea.
- One last time, right?

1:14:59.095 --> 1:15:00.027
- Yeah.
- Why not?

1:15:02.732 --> 1:15:04.098
What's going on?

1:15:04.133 --> 1:15:05.433
- Come on. It's not
working. It's not working!

1:15:05.468 --> 1:15:07.435
- We tested everything.
It should be fine.

1:15:07.470 --> 1:15:09.837
- 30 seconds to show time!

1:15:09.873 --> 1:15:11.606
- I'll check. I'll check.

1:15:11.641 --> 1:15:15.209
(suspenseful music)

1:15:15.245 --> 1:15:17.078
(beep)

1:15:17.113 --> 1:15:18.446
- come on.

1:15:18.481 --> 1:15:21.549
Oh my gosh. This
can't be happening.

1:15:23.887 --> 1:15:26.187
- Okay. Okay. Try it.
It should be good.

1:15:26.222 --> 1:15:27.388
All right.

1:15:27.423 --> 1:15:28.289
- [bill] I'll test it one
more time while we have time.

1:15:28.324 --> 1:15:29.357
- Yeah, test it.

1:15:29.392 --> 1:15:30.892
- That's it everybody!

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:34.262
No more tinkering,
testing, or touch ups .

1:15:34.297 --> 1:15:35.796
- Oh great.

1:15:35.832 --> 1:15:37.431
I guess we won't know if it
works until it's our turn.

1:15:37.467 --> 1:15:41.269
- Welcome everyone to
our bright nights finals!

1:15:41.304 --> 1:15:44.305
(crowd clapping and cheering)

1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:46.741
let's give a big,
warm round of applause

1:15:46.776 --> 1:15:48.809
to our first finalist...

1:15:48.845 --> 1:15:49.777
Glowscapes!

1:15:50.847 --> 1:15:55.416
(crowd clapping and cheering)

1:15:55.451 --> 1:16:00.054
("joy to the world"
syncing to lights)

1:16:15.972 --> 1:16:16.871
- yeah!

1:16:31.487 --> 1:16:33.087
Yeah!

1:16:33.122 --> 1:16:36.457
(techno music blaring)

1:16:48.805 --> 1:16:52.306
- [wendy] that was
incredible, wasn't it?

1:16:52.342 --> 1:16:53.274
(crowd cheering)

1:16:53.309 --> 1:16:56.811
and now get ready for
our other finalist,

1:16:56.846 --> 1:16:58.045
what name are they going with?

1:16:58.081 --> 1:17:00.147
- Making spirits bright.

1:17:00.783 --> 1:17:04.118
- Making spirits bright! Woo!

1:17:04.153 --> 1:17:05.553
- Nice of you to join us, frank.

1:17:05.588 --> 1:17:07.054
- Well, better late than never.

1:17:07.090 --> 1:17:08.556
(laughing)

1:17:08.591 --> 1:17:09.657
- do the honors?

1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:13.661
- Let's do it together, like
it always should have been.

1:17:16.799 --> 1:17:17.732
- Ready?

1:17:19.736 --> 1:17:21.702
- One, two, three.

1:17:24.307 --> 1:17:26.707
- [tony] guys, hit the thing.

1:17:29.579 --> 1:17:31.345
(boys tapping switch)

1:17:31.381 --> 1:17:32.246
- good job.

1:17:36.419 --> 1:17:40.021
(christmas melody starts)

1:18:01.778 --> 1:18:02.710
- whoa!

1:18:04.681 --> 1:18:08.549
(christmas melody continues)

1:19:08.244 --> 1:19:09.944
- just about perfect, isn't it?

1:19:13.349 --> 1:19:16.150
(crowd cheering)

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:30.197
- on behalf of
cardinal group energy

1:19:30.233 --> 1:19:32.199
and the bright nights committee,

1:19:32.235 --> 1:19:34.368
I am pleased to
announce the winner

1:19:34.403 --> 1:19:37.972
of the 15th annual
bright nights contest...

1:19:42.111 --> 1:19:43.811
Making spirits bright!

1:19:44.447 --> 1:19:48.482
(crowd cheering and clapping)

1:20:03.699 --> 1:20:05.699
- you know, I just
realized something. -

1:20:05.735 --> 1:20:06.634
- Oh, what's that?

1:20:06.669 --> 1:20:08.936
- Well, remember when
I gave you a ride

1:20:08.971 --> 1:20:11.105
and I said we were square?

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:12.339
We weren't.

1:20:12.375 --> 1:20:13.474
- Oh?

1:20:13.509 --> 1:20:16.610
No, 'cause I took that
snowball in the back for you.

1:20:16.646 --> 1:20:17.645
- That's right.

1:20:20.416 --> 1:20:23.250
(cheerful music)

1:20:27.323 --> 1:20:29.023
- what about now? Are we square?

1:20:30.126 --> 1:20:31.025
- Um.

1:20:36.265 --> 1:20:37.097
- We're getting there.

1:20:37.133 --> 1:20:39.767
(grace laughs)

1:20:42.271 --> 1:20:43.904
- frank, will you get a move on?

1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:45.806
You move like a snail.

1:20:45.842 --> 1:20:48.075
- Bill, you don't want me to
fall off the ladder again,

1:20:48.110 --> 1:20:49.276
do you?

1:20:49.312 --> 1:20:50.744
- No, I just don't want us
to miss the show, that's all.

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:52.546
- [frank] we won't.

1:20:52.582 --> 1:20:53.547
- I'll get the car.

1:20:55.685 --> 1:20:58.219
- Hey, we should
have our own show.

1:20:58.254 --> 1:20:59.486
- Hey pat.

1:20:59.522 --> 1:21:02.223
Yeah, look man, I just wanted
to thank you for hooking me up

1:21:02.258 --> 1:21:04.892
with that restaurant
group in bonaire.

1:21:04.927 --> 1:21:06.260
No, I think I'm going to be
able to turn things around

1:21:06.295 --> 1:21:07.228
for them.

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:10.898
Hey, can I call you back?
My sister's calling.

1:21:12.335 --> 1:21:13.267
Hey maria.

1:21:13.302 --> 1:21:14.935
Yeah, I'm gonna be home in 10.

1:21:15.838 --> 1:21:16.770
Tell grace not to worry,

1:21:16.806 --> 1:21:18.672
I'm going to be there
before the show starts.

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:19.607
Okay, bye.

1:21:25.047 --> 1:21:26.847
- Cheese, cheese. I got
cheese just for you.

1:21:26.883 --> 1:21:28.682
- [arlene] oh, yum.

1:21:28.718 --> 1:21:30.117
- Have we started yet?

1:21:30.152 --> 1:21:31.852
- [arlene] no, no. Everybody
find a seat though.

1:21:31.888 --> 1:21:33.487
- Hey, where's tony?

1:21:33.522 --> 1:21:36.156
- Here I am!
- Oh, here he is.

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:38.092
- Oh, you inherited your
father's flair for the dramatic.

1:21:38.127 --> 1:21:39.493
I thought you might
miss the start.

1:21:39.528 --> 1:21:40.461
- Not for the world.

1:21:40.496 --> 1:21:42.096
- Aww.

1:21:42.131 --> 1:21:43.163
I made your favorite.

1:21:44.133 --> 1:21:44.999
- Oh, thank you.

1:21:45.034 --> 1:21:47.935
- Okay, okay. Sit, sit, sit.

1:21:47.970 --> 1:21:48.836
You guys ready?

1:21:48.871 --> 1:21:49.737
- Yeah!

1:21:52.141 --> 1:21:54.341
- Okay, here we go.

1:21:54.377 --> 1:21:55.309
- I'm sarah wolf.

1:21:55.344 --> 1:21:56.777
- And I'm grace ryan.
