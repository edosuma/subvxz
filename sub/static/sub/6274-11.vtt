Virginia: No,
I s-- I said no thank you.

08:59.409 --> 09:00.825
Daphne:
Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am.

09:00.861 --> 09:01.993
Virginia: May I have
a wet towel, please?

09:02.029 --> 09:03.361
Daphne: Yes.

09:03.413 --> 09:04.613
Oh.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.867
Here.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.785
Hey, you don't like it?
It's not so bad.

09:10.837 --> 09:13.955
Virginia: It's the--
The gentleman that I'm seeing,

09:14.007 --> 09:17.876
he-- he has an aversion to me
wearing fragrances of any kind.

09:17.928 --> 09:19.711
Daphne: An aversion?
Allergies, you mean?

09:19.763 --> 09:22.881
Virginia: No, no. It's-- he
has, uh, a very sensitive nose.

[ Toilet flushes ]

09:24.518 --> 09:28.053

It's fine. I'll live. Thank you.

Paul: Did I get him?

09:37.447 --> 09:39.698
Johnny: Uh, no,
he's over there now. See him?

09:39.733 --> 09:40.732
Paul: - Where?
Johnny: - Quick!

09:40.734 --> 09:41.866
Paul: Oh.

09:41.902 --> 09:43.985
- Got him.
Johnny: - Are you sure?

09:44.037 --> 09:46.154
Paul: Flat as a pancake.
You want to see?

09:46.206 --> 09:48.240
Johnny: No, that's okay.
I trust you.

09:48.242 --> 09:49.708
Paul: Come on.

09:49.743 --> 09:53.161
Johnny: I'm not afraid of them
or anything.

09:53.213 --> 09:55.163
Just don't like them.

09:55.215 --> 09:57.215
Paul: I get it.

09:57.251 --> 09:58.750
Is there anything else
you're not too fond of?

09:58.802 --> 10:01.586
Johnny:
I don't really like thunder.

10:01.638 --> 10:03.822
Paul:
Oh, well, come on.

10:04.157 --> 10:06.481
Does anyone like thunder,
really? An

10:06.482 --> 10:09.113
Maybe timpanists, you know?

10:09.205 --> 10:11.781
In the orchestras,
with the big drums?

10:11.782 --> 10:13.254
They probably like it.

10:13.255 --> 10:15.288
You're probably right.

10:15.294 --> 10:17.691
You know what I'm afraid of,
Johnny?

10:17.743 --> 10:18.942
Johnny: What?

10:18.944 --> 10:22.529
Paul: Letting people see
that I'm afraid.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.414
It's like,
what are they gonna think?

every time
he goes to the doctor,

he's got to shut his eyes
and whistle a tune

when he gets a shot.

10:30.622 --> 10:32.205
Johnny: - You do that?
Paul: - [ Chuckling ] Yeah.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.257
Every single time.

10:34.293 --> 10:38.128
Here.
You play the doctor.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.130
I'll play me. All right?

10:40.132 --> 10:41.765
Johnny: - Okay.
Paul: - All right.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.216
Johnny: Time for your shot,
Mr. Edley. Are you ready?

gonna tell anybody, right?

And you won't tell mine?

I won't tell a soul.

All right.
Get some sleep.

Johnny: - Good night, Mr. Edley.
Paul: - Good night, Johnny.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.962
Dan: Well, I'm sorry you didn't
have my girl make the reservation.

11:11.997 --> 11:13.663
I have some pull here.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.299
I invested in Gordon's place
in Midtown a few years back.

11:16.335 --> 11:18.969
Excuse me,
could you tell Chef Ostroff

11:19.004 --> 11:21.421
that Dan Logan is
with the Masters party--

11:21.473 --> 11:22.672
that's the reservation
that's gone missing--

11:22.724 --> 11:24.174
and ask if
he can accommodate us?

11:24.226 --> 11:26.142
William: Apparently,
they're booked until--

11:26.178 --> 11:28.178
Dan: And that we're very much looking
forward to the tartare tonight.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.013
It's not on the menu,
but they make it when I ask.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.516
Virginia: - Dan? Nice to see you.
Dan: - Virginia.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.935
Virginia: You're alone?

11:34.987 --> 11:37.437
Dan: Uh, Alice is on her way
from uptown.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.273
I must say, Virginia, I wasn't
expecting your invitation.

11:40.359 --> 11:42.125
Virginia: The invitation
didn't come from me.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.027
Dan: Oh, well, my secretary said
a woman called, so I assumed.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.445
That wasn't you?
Then who--

11:45.497 --> 11:47.230
Virginia: Bill, uh,
did you have Betty

11:47.266 --> 11:48.398
make these arrangements?

11:48.433 --> 11:50.400
William: Why, yes, I did.

11:50.435 --> 11:51.785
Why don't I have them
check that?

11:51.837 --> 11:53.003
Dan: Okay.

11:54.706 --> 11:56.840
Thank you.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.959
Virginia: - I am so sorry.
Dan: - Mm-hmm.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.877
Virginia:
I had absolutely no idea.

12:00.879 --> 12:03.797
Bill orchestrated this
entire thing without telling me.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.582
Why would you bring your wife?

12:05.617 --> 12:08.551
Dan: Because when the invitation
came in, presumably from you,

12:08.604 --> 12:10.353
my secretary called Alice
to confirm the time

12:10.389 --> 12:11.805
without consulting me.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.356
- And there you are.
Alice: - Hello, darling.

12:13.392 --> 12:15.475
Dan: Mm. You made it.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.726
I would like to introduce you
to--

12:16.778 --> 12:18.812
Virginia: Virginia Johnson.
Hello.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.647
Alice: Finally.
I'm so glad you called.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.866
Danny just thinks
the world of you.

12:22.901 --> 12:24.234
Talks about you nonstop.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.902
Virginia: Is that right?

12:25.904 --> 12:28.004
Alice: And, my goodness,
you're just a slip of a thing.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.041
I-I don't know why I always imagined
you'd be much bigger boned.

12:31.076 --> 12:32.909
William:
Mrs. Logan, I presume.

12:32.911 --> 12:35.412
Alice: - Alice, please.
William: - Bill Masters.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.914
I'm just delighted that you
and your husband could join us.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.183
Now, there has been a little
snafu with the reservation

12:40.218 --> 12:42.052
- that we're working out.
Maitre D': - Mr. Logan,

12:42.087 --> 12:44.671
I am so sorry to keep you
and your party waiting.

12:44.723 --> 12:48.058
We have a table for you
if you will follow Jacques.

12:48.093 --> 12:52.228
Dan: Ladies?

12:52.264 --> 12:55.432
It's all who you know, Bill.

12:55.434 --> 12:57.267
William: Whom.

12:57.269 --> 12:58.401
It's whom.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.106
Alice: Uh,
this is a table for two.

13:03.108 --> 13:04.741
Virginia:
We're a party of four.

13:04.776 --> 13:06.943
William: Well, five,
if you include the coat.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.112
And may I ask,
where do you sit your patrons

13:09.164 --> 13:11.031
who don't have pull--
the scullery?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.615
Jacques: [ French accent ]
I'm terribly sorry.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.869
This is the only table we have
available at the moment.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.954
Dan: Perhaps we should wait
for something else to open up.

13:17.956 --> 13:19.956
Jacques: I'm afraid
we are fully booked, sir.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.374
Virginia:
Or come back another time.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.209
William:
Oh, don't be silly.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.378
We can all squeeze in.
Can't we, Alice?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.213
Alice: Absolutely.
It'll be cozy.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.802
Jacques:
You're sure I can't check--

13:32.804 --> 13:34.471
Virginia:
I'm quite sure, thank you.

13:38.143 --> 13:41.277
Jacques: May I get you started
with a cocktail? Ladies?

13:41.313 --> 13:43.279
Virginia:
A Manhattan, please.

13:43.315 --> 13:44.914
Dan: Alice?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.400
So, she'll have a tonic water
with a squeeze of--

13:47.452 --> 13:48.485
Alice:
Uh, white wine, please.

13:48.487 --> 13:49.986
Dan: But, honey--

13:50.021 --> 13:51.654
Alice: I'd like a glass
of white wine, Dan.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.490
Do you have an objection
to that?

13:53.492 --> 13:55.959
Dan: Why don't we make it
a spritzer?

13:55.994 --> 13:58.828
William: First,
uh, can I suggest

13:58.880 --> 14:01.998
that we start with a bottle
of your finest champagne?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.249
We're celebrating.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.168
Alice: Ooh.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.973
Libby:
What are you doing?

14:10.008 --> 14:13.009
Paul:
It was slow to drain, so...

14:13.044 --> 14:14.594
What?

14:14.646 --> 14:17.013
Libby: You can't fix everything
in the house.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.449
He's only gone two days.
He's gonna come back and notice.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.684
Paul: Oh, really?
Bill's gonna notice?

14:21.737 --> 14:24.104
Come on.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.823
Libby: Well,
you do have to be more careful

14:26.858 --> 14:28.441
in front of the kids.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.611
You can't take my hand
under the dining-room table

14:31.663 --> 14:33.496
or reach under my skirt.

14:33.532 --> 14:34.664
Paul:
Oh, they didn't see that.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.784
Libby:
But they could have.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.036
You can't call me Lib
in front of them, either.

14:40.038 --> 14:41.337
Paul: - Did I do that?
Libby: - Mm-hmm.

14:41.373 --> 14:42.672
Paul: Oh.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.290
Libby: You know,
"pass the ketchup, Lib.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.176
Those potatoes were delicious, Lib."

14:46.211 --> 14:47.844
Paul: All right.
I have this fantasy, okay?

14:47.879 --> 14:50.130
Now, don't laugh at me,
but I have this fantasy

14:50.182 --> 14:53.133
that, you know, the kids
will start calling me Paul.

14:53.185 --> 14:57.020
Not right away, but just
eventually, you know?

14:57.055 --> 14:58.688
You know how Howie has
that thing with "L's"?

14:58.723 --> 15:01.224
Libby: I secretly hope
he never loses it.

15:01.226 --> 15:03.693
Paul: I know. Well, if you
drop the "L" off of "Paul,"

15:03.728 --> 15:05.895
that becomes "paw," right?

15:05.947 --> 15:08.898
And then maybe the older kids
start calling me pa,

15:08.900 --> 15:11.568
and then, pretty soon,
that's what I am to them.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.571
You know, their pa.

15:14.623 --> 15:18.408
You wouldn't have a problem
with that, would you?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.910
[ Both chuckle ]

15:29.221 --> 15:30.670
William:
To "Human Sexual Inadequacy."

15:30.722 --> 15:33.256
Dan:
"Human Sexual Inadequacy."

15:33.308 --> 15:35.091
Alice: Do we really want
to toast that?

15:35.093 --> 15:37.343
Dan: It's the name of Bill
and Virginia's next book.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.728
Alice: Oh, I see.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.096
William: [ Chuckles ]

15:40.148 --> 15:42.182
Alice: Well, then,
congratulations, you two.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.766
How exciting.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.351
Dan: After the success
of the first one,

15:45.403 --> 15:46.769
I'm sure this one was
pretty much in the bag.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.238
No hard sell required.

15:48.273 --> 15:50.106
Virginia: Yes,
you'd think, wouldn't you,

15:50.158 --> 15:53.359
that all we needed to do was let
the couples work that we've done

15:53.411 --> 15:54.777
speak for itself.

15:54.779 --> 15:58.031
But Bill felt the need
to up the ante.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.282
William:
Virginia, please, let's not.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.117
Virginia: Oh, let's.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.086
William:
Virginia's upset with me

16:03.121 --> 16:08.091
because I... deviated slightly
from our agreed-upon script.

16:08.126 --> 16:12.045
Virginia: I wouldn't say "deviated,"
and I wouldn't say "slightly."

16:12.097 --> 16:14.714
I'd say that you hijacked
the meeting entirely.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.965
William: [ Chuckles ]

16:15.967 --> 16:17.550
Virginia:
Uh, Bill told them

16:17.602 --> 16:20.136
that we intend to include
a chapter in the next book

16:20.138 --> 16:21.638
on our work with surrogates.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.273
Dan: Mm. I thought
you were phasing that out.

16:23.308 --> 16:25.808
Virginia: Yes, well,
Bill revived it this afternoon

16:25.810 --> 16:29.062
and committed us
to continuing with the program.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.563
William: Only after
the Little Brown team

16:30.615 --> 16:32.448
seemed disinclined
to move forward.

16:32.484 --> 16:34.984
Virginia: Not disinclined,
and even if they were,

16:35.036 --> 16:36.819
that doesn't mean
that you should jump in

16:36.872 --> 16:39.489
and offer up research
that we both decided

16:39.541 --> 16:41.791
to postpone
for the foreseeable future.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.160
William: They never would've committed
to so large an advance, Virginia.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.863
Virginia: [ Sighs ] The last time
that we were short hard evidence

16:46.898 --> 16:48.665
that our research
would yield solid results--

16:48.667 --> 16:52.335
the impotency work-- you argued
that it was wrong to promote it.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.920
Alice: Do most people assume
you're married?

16:53.972 --> 16:55.338
William: [ Chuckles ]

16:55.340 --> 16:58.174
Alice: You seem married.
Don't they seem married?

16:58.226 --> 16:59.676
Dan:
They're not married.

16:59.711 --> 17:01.594
In fact,
Bill has a very lovely wife.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.263
William: Mm, you've met?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.848
Dan: No, but I've seen
her picture on your desk.

17:05.849 --> 17:07.267
You don't bring her along
when you travel?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.852
William: - I don't.
Dan: - Oh, why's that?

17:09.854 --> 17:12.188
Surely she would like a trip
to New York, wouldn't she?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.324
William: Yes, but we do have
three children at home.

17:14.358 --> 17:16.025
Alice:
Oh. Do you have pictures?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.327
William: I don't, no.

17:17.362 --> 17:20.863
Dan: Really? No pictures?
Not a one?

17:20.865 --> 17:23.333
Alice: Dan doesn't like to bring
me on his adventures, either.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.367
William: - Oh, and why's that?
Alice: - I have a theory.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.538
William:
Oh, I would love to hear it.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.340
Dan:
Another breadbasket, please?

17:30.375 --> 17:31.457
Alice: Well, with so many
more women in the workforce,

17:31.509 --> 17:33.376
I think it's easier for a man,

17:33.428 --> 17:35.178
especially one
as handsome as him,

17:35.213 --> 17:38.681
to conduct his business
unencumbered by a wedding ring.

17:38.717 --> 17:40.216
Wouldn't you agree, Virginia?

17:41.770 --> 17:44.087
I'm asking you as a woman.

17:44.122 --> 17:48.308
Virginia:
I really wouldn't know.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.361
Alice: It's not unlike
your approach, Bill.

17:51.396 --> 17:53.980
You tantalize the buyer
with the promise of something

17:54.032 --> 17:56.065
that you may not actually
be able to provide.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.901
I'm not blind.
I know I married a flirt.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.403
William: [ Chuckles ]

18:00.405 --> 18:01.988
Alice: But it got me
a three-bedroom apartment

18:02.040 --> 18:03.823
overlooking
the Museum of Natural History.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.409
Dan: Hey, might want
to slow down a bit, dear.

18:06.444 --> 18:08.077
Alice: Mm.

18:08.079 --> 18:10.046
You might want to stop squeezing
my leg under the table.

18:12.117 --> 18:14.667
What was the name
of the woman in Dallas?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.085
The linen heiress?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.954
Danny sold her on the idea

18:17.989 --> 18:21.758
of including lavender sachets
in her seet shets.

18:23.645 --> 18:24.894
Sheet... sets.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.262
William: [ Chuckles ]

18:26.314 --> 18:27.930
Alice: [ Laughing ]
That's hard to say.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.933
Dan: Especially after
two glasses of champagne.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.353
William: Well,
may I propose another toast?

18:33.405 --> 18:34.687
Alice: - Mm!
Virginia: - I vote no.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.939
Um, I'm sorry.
Was that rhetorical?

18:36.941 --> 18:39.025
Alice: I love your
sense of humor, Virginia.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.743
It's very New York.
Are you Jewish?

18:40.779 --> 18:42.111
William: To you, Dan.

18:42.113 --> 18:44.030
Dan: To me?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.948
William: Well-- well, we could
never have gotten to this point

18:45.950 --> 18:47.617
without your financial support.

18:47.669 --> 18:48.951
Alice: Hm.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.537
Dan: Well, that's, uh...

18:51.589 --> 18:53.423
That's kind of you to say, Bill.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.957
William: Well,
it's absolutely true.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.876
- Isn't it, Virginia?
Virginia: - It is.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.761
Uh, you have kept us afloat.

18:58.797 --> 19:01.631
William:
And I am happy to report

19:01.633 --> 19:04.300
that the advance
we received today

19:04.302 --> 19:07.637
will more than cover our
operational costs from now on.

19:07.639 --> 19:11.641
So we're not just able
to repay you in full.

19:11.643 --> 19:13.109
We're also able
to provide you

19:13.144 --> 19:17.980
with a significant return
on your investment.

19:18.016 --> 19:20.066
Thank you.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.235
To the end of our journey.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.620
Alice: Hear, hear.
[ Chuckles ]

19:24.656 --> 19:27.657
Come on, you two.
To happy endings.

19:27.659 --> 19:29.992
Virginia: So this is yet another
thing you've just decided, Bill,

19:29.994 --> 19:32.412
that our work with Dan is over?

19:32.464 --> 19:34.630
William: Well, isn't it?
I'm sorry. Do you disagree, Dan?

19:34.666 --> 19:36.666
You made an investment.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.168
It paid off--
handsomely, I may add.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.971
Dan: When I engaged your services,
we entered into a partnership.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.974
William: Oh.
Did you see it that way?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.477
A partnership?
What? Like Virginia's and mine?

19:47.512 --> 19:48.978
Dan: No, actually,

19:49.013 --> 19:50.430
because I don't
make decisions unilaterally

19:50.482 --> 19:51.981
without her participation.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.267
William: Well,
perhaps you can clarify for me.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.853
Uh, what is the argument for,

19:56.905 --> 19:59.605
uh, perpetuating
this arrangement?

19:59.657 --> 20:03.192
Your venture into,
uh... lubricants?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.777
Dan: Lotions.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.446
William: Lotions.
I'm sorry. You're right.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.997
Alice:
There was a company in Seattle

20:08.032 --> 20:10.450
that Danny did
a lotion line with.

20:10.502 --> 20:13.252
He was working very closely
for many months

20:13.338 --> 20:15.371
with the most darling
Japanese chemist.

20:15.373 --> 20:17.373
What was her name-- Emiko?

20:17.425 --> 20:21.544
Virginia: I'm so sorry that you don't
consider our efforts worthwhile,

20:21.596 --> 20:24.464
but I have certainly
granted you latitude

20:24.516 --> 20:26.682
to pursue the things
you find interesting.

20:26.718 --> 20:28.151
Alice:
I thought the scent was lovely,

20:28.186 --> 20:29.886
but Dan didn't like me
to wear it.

20:29.938 --> 20:33.322
It's funny. He objects to me
wearing fragrance of any kind.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.191
Isn't that silly, Virginia?

20:35.226 --> 20:41.531
For a man in <i> his</i> line of work
to have... what's the word?

20:41.566 --> 20:42.832
An aversion?

20:42.867 --> 20:46.202
Dan: You know
what occurs to me, Bill?

20:46.237 --> 20:49.672
Is that you planned this dinner

20:49.707 --> 20:52.375
before you knew how the meeting
with your publisher was gonna go.

20:52.410 --> 20:55.578
William: Well,
it's like you said yourself--

20:55.630 --> 20:58.080
a positive outcome
was virtually assured.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.749
Our last book was
a best-seller.

20:59.801 --> 21:03.503
Dan: No, no. But then it means
you must've come prepared

21:03.555 --> 21:06.556
to offer up the surrogacy work
over Virginia's objections.

21:06.591 --> 21:09.225
Anything
to get your publisher on board

21:09.260 --> 21:12.178
so there would be cause
for celebration tonight

21:12.263 --> 21:15.731
and a reason to say to me,
"Thank you. Here's your hat.

21:15.767 --> 21:19.519
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out."

21:19.571 --> 21:21.771
Virginia:
Dan, Alice,

21:21.773 --> 21:24.607
I am so sorry
to have to cut this short.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.192
It was lovely to meet you.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.278
Alice: - You're leaving?
Virginia: - I'm afraid so.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.613
I knew there was a reason
I held on to my coat.

21:30.615 --> 21:32.081
Alice: You're sick?

21:32.116 --> 21:35.868
Virginia: Yes. Of him.
If you'll excuse me.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.287
William: - Virginia--
Virginia: - Go to hell.

21:38.289 --> 21:39.872
Libby: There's something
I need to talk to you about.

21:39.924 --> 21:44.760
It's about us
and about the future.

[ Sighs ]

21:48.099 --> 21:50.967
Paul: It's okay.
It's a-- it's a good start.

21:51.002 --> 21:54.604
Libby: You don't think
it-- it feels too dire?

21:54.639 --> 21:57.056
I mean, maybe there's
a more casual way to get into it

21:57.108 --> 21:58.808
so Bill's not
immediately on his guard.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.476
Paul:
No, I don't-- I don't--

22:00.478 --> 22:02.278
I don't think the downbeat
is the problem, honey.

22:02.313 --> 22:05.514
I think you just need to be more
honest and be direct with him.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.016
Just tell him what you want.

22:07.051 --> 22:08.284
Libby: What do I want?

22:08.319 --> 22:09.785
Paul: Well...

22:09.821 --> 22:12.655
Libby: Do I-- do I ask
for a divorce right away,

22:12.657 --> 22:16.576
or do I want a separation first
and then a divorce?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.494
What do I say
when he asks me why?

22:18.496 --> 22:20.296
I mean,
he is gonna ask me why.

22:20.331 --> 22:25.251
Paul: Well, what if he does?
What are you gonna tell him?

22:25.303 --> 22:27.169
Libby: I don't want him to know
it's because of you.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.840
I-I think that just
makes it... harder.

22:30.842 --> 22:34.477
Paul: Well, look, you had many reasons
to leave him before me, right?

22:34.512 --> 22:37.813
- I mean...
Libby: - Yeah.

22:37.849 --> 22:39.982
Just not the courage.

22:40.018 --> 22:41.067
Paul: Right.

22:44.355 --> 22:47.440

I think he'll be shocked.

22:47.492 --> 22:52.278
And then... maybe angry.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.996
I don't think he'll yell.

22:54.032 --> 22:58.334
I mean, he might, but... I think
he would be too scared

22:58.369 --> 23:00.336
that I would say something
about Virginia

23:00.371 --> 23:03.789
to ever accuse me of anything.

Like, uh,
when you're getting dressed

27:02.180 --> 27:04.614
or in the bathtub
or in the shower?

27:04.649 --> 27:07.049
Johnny: No.

David: Has he ever shown you
how <i> his</i> body works?

27:09.387 --> 27:11.120
Libby: Of course he hasn't,
Detective.

27:11.155 --> 27:12.488
David:
Mrs. Masters, please.

27:12.490 --> 27:14.957
Johnny:
Of course he hasn't.

27:19.530 --> 27:22.381
David: Has he ever shown
any of your friends

27:22.417 --> 27:24.467
how <i> their</i> bodies work?

27:27.538 --> 27:29.372
Johnny: I don't know.

David: You've never heard him
talk about those kind of things

27:34.345 --> 27:37.680
with any of your friends?

With my friends? No.

27:44.689 --> 27:47.390
This is very important, Johnny.

Who has he talked to?

27:53.965 --> 27:55.631
Johnny: So,
once he talked to Dennis.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.750
Libby: Dennis Daughtry?

27:57.785 --> 28:00.202
David: And he talked to him
about his body?

28:00.204 --> 28:02.705
Libby: When was this?

28:02.707 --> 28:06.575
Johnny: Few weeks ago.
After the party for the team.

28:06.611 --> 28:08.127
Libby: Well, I was there.

28:08.179 --> 28:10.263
I-- I didn't see your father
talking to Dennis.

28:10.298 --> 28:13.282
Johnny:
You were putting Howie to bed.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.885
Dennis was waiting
for his mom to pick him up.

28:15.887 --> 28:17.253
That's what he said.

28:17.288 --> 28:19.755
David: And what did you hear
them talking about?

28:19.791 --> 28:22.491
Johnny: - I don't remember.
David: - You don't remember

28:22.527 --> 28:26.162
what you told Martha Geiss and
Olive Lambert on the playground?

28:29.300 --> 28:30.733
Johnny: No.

28:30.785 --> 28:32.401
David: Because they said
you told them something

28:32.453 --> 28:35.121
about Dennis and your father.

28:35.156 --> 28:37.773
Libby: What did you tell them,
Johnny?

28:37.809 --> 28:39.108
It's okay.

28:39.143 --> 28:40.876
David:
You don't remember saying

28:40.912 --> 28:44.580
that your father had to show
Dennis how to fix his penis?

28:44.615 --> 28:46.749
Libby: What?
What?

28:46.751 --> 28:48.517
Johnny: Yes, but...

28:48.553 --> 28:54.590
I didn't mean-- I just-- I
just said that 'cause I was mad.

28:54.592 --> 28:55.825
David:
And why were you mad?

28:55.860 --> 28:58.594
Johnny:
Because I hate that kid.

28:58.596 --> 28:59.829
He's an asshole.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.315
Libby: Johnny.

29:02.350 --> 29:04.317
Johnny: And-- and dad's
always so nice to him.

29:04.352 --> 29:05.484
David:
How is he nice to him?

29:05.520 --> 29:08.354
Johnny:
He just is. He...

29:08.406 --> 29:13.142
He talks to him...
Spends time with him.

29:13.177 --> 29:14.977
David:
Spends time with him

29:15.013 --> 29:16.979
in ways that are different than
the way he spends time with you?

29:17.015 --> 29:18.647
Johnny:
He doesn't spend time with me.

29:18.683 --> 29:20.282
Libby:
That's not true, Johnny.

29:20.335 --> 29:23.285
Johnny:
He likes Dennis more.

29:23.287 --> 29:25.705
Libby: - No, sweetheart.
David: - Mrs. Masters.

29:25.757 --> 29:29.759
Johnny... I need to know.

29:29.794 --> 29:32.378
Have you ever seen
your father and Dennis

29:32.430 --> 29:34.230
have any kind
of physical contact--

29:34.265 --> 29:35.598
Libby: Okay,
that is enough, Detective.

29:35.633 --> 29:36.882
David:
I am not done here, ma'am.

29:36.934 --> 29:38.551
Libby: Yes,
I would say you are done.

29:38.603 --> 29:40.186
I am not gonna subject my child
to any more of this.

29:40.221 --> 29:41.904
David: I can bring him
down to the station

29:41.939 --> 29:43.556
- if that's what you prefer.
Libby: - Do not threaten me, sir.

29:43.608 --> 29:45.391
- Johnny, I need you to go to y--
Johnny: - I'm sorry.

29:45.443 --> 29:46.809
Libby: It's okay. It's okay.
You didn't do anything wrong.

29:46.861 --> 29:47.877
Johnny: I'm sorry.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.195
Libby: No one's mad at you,
honey.

29:49.230 --> 29:50.696
I just need a few minutes alone
with the detective.

29:50.732 --> 29:52.365
Johnny: - But, mom--
Libby: - It's okay. Please go.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.735

to tuck you in. Go on. Go on.

[ Bedroom door closes ]

29:59.657 --> 30:01.574
I don't know what you think
is going on here.

30:01.626 --> 30:05.044
I don't know who said what, if
some silly girl on a playground

30:05.079 --> 30:07.413
twisted my son's words to make
it seem like my husband--

30:07.465 --> 30:09.415
David: The boy confirmed
with his mother

30:09.467 --> 30:13.202
that your husband showed him
pictures of a naked man.

30:13.237 --> 30:15.921
Libby:
My husband is a doctor.

30:15.973 --> 30:18.507
If he showed that boy
images in a medical textbook,

30:18.559 --> 30:21.177
I am sure there is a perfectly
reasonable explanation for it.

30:21.179 --> 30:22.812
David:
Without his mother's knowledge?

30:22.847 --> 30:24.814
Libby: [ Scoffs ]
I would say any mother

30:24.849 --> 30:27.650
who leaves her son at a party
isn't fit to judge.

30:27.685 --> 30:30.986
David: Mrs. Masters, can you
tell me the circumstances

30:31.022 --> 30:35.524
under which an adult showing
a minor explicit sexual images

30:35.576 --> 30:37.860
can be considered
appropriate behavior?

30:40.665 --> 30:43.165
Libby: My husband
would never hurt a child.

30:43.201 --> 30:46.502
David: And yet it sounds to me
as if he's hurt your son.

30:46.537 --> 30:48.537
Libby:
You need to leave, Detective.

30:48.589 --> 30:49.839
David: That's fine.

30:49.874 --> 30:52.174
I will have to follow up,
of course.

30:52.210 --> 30:55.878
Libby: And when you do,
our lawyer will be present.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.854
Dan: Hmm. Well,
let's get our check, shall we?

31:04.889 --> 31:06.322
Alice:
We barely just ordered.

31:06.357 --> 31:08.824
Dan: I think this dinner's over,
wouldn't you say?

31:08.860 --> 31:10.226
Alice:
I don't want to go.

31:10.311 --> 31:11.444

Alice: - You can go.

31:11.479 --> 31:12.895

31:12.947 --> 31:14.980
Alice: Are you not hearing me?
I'm staying.

31:15.032 --> 31:16.148
Do you want me to make a scene?

31:21.289 --> 31:23.572
Dan: [ Sighs ]

31:23.574 --> 31:26.008
You want to finish the bottle.
That's it, isn't it?

31:26.043 --> 31:28.160
So how long have you
managed to go this time?

31:28.212 --> 31:29.662
Three months?

31:29.714 --> 31:31.947
Alice: I'll go to a meeting
in the morning.

31:31.983 --> 31:35.151
I'm sorry.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.520
Dan: - You're not.
Alice: - Are <i> you</i> sorry?

31:37.555 --> 31:39.522
Dan: Yes, I am.

31:39.557 --> 31:41.757
Alice: For being with her,
or for rubbing my face in it?

31:41.759 --> 31:43.843
Dan: You know I wouldn't have chosen
for you to find out this way.

31:43.895 --> 31:46.095
Alice: Is there a good way
to meet your husband's mistress?

31:46.097 --> 31:47.730
Can't you even pretend?

31:47.765 --> 31:50.266
Dan: I've never denied
I was with any of them, Alice.

31:50.268 --> 31:53.369
I've always been straight
with you.

31:53.404 --> 31:54.904
You can't claim it's unfair

31:54.939 --> 31:56.322
when it was you
who proposed this arrangement.

31:56.357 --> 31:58.240
Alice:
What choice did I have?

31:58.276 --> 31:59.775
Dan: Alice, I don't want
to do this here. Let's go.

31:59.777 --> 32:01.994
Alice: I'm asking.

32:02.029 --> 32:04.914
What choice did you leave me
with but to look the other way?

32:04.949 --> 32:06.348
Dan: You do not want
to go down this road. Trust me.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.951
Alice: Oh, why not?

32:09.003 --> 32:10.336
Dan:
Because you don't think

32:10.371 --> 32:12.321
your behavior leaves me
without a choice?

32:12.356 --> 32:14.256
Every time you disappear
down that bottle

32:14.292 --> 32:15.524
and I have to come find you

or you threaten
to hurt yourself.

32:17.195 --> 32:19.628
Alice:
It brings you back.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.263
Admit it, you like fixing me.

32:21.299 --> 32:23.966
Dan: I used to.

32:23.968 --> 32:27.303
Can't say I've done such
a good job of it lately, have I?

32:27.305 --> 32:29.889
Alice: You always like the ones
that need fixing.

32:31.809 --> 32:34.276
Tell me.
How is this one broken?

32:35.279 --> 32:37.413
Dan: She's not.

32:37.448 --> 32:41.567
Alice: Come on. What is it?
Financial problems?

32:41.619 --> 32:45.404
Childhood abuse? An
ex-husband who's stalking her?

32:45.456 --> 32:48.073
Dan:
Virginia's different.

Dan:
I'm in love with her, Alice.

33:00.137 --> 33:03.839
Now, you've never heard me
say that before.

33:03.891 --> 33:07.009
Virginia: What kind of
partnership do we have, Bill,

33:07.061 --> 33:10.613
if you marginalize me
every time I've upset you?

33:10.648 --> 33:14.683
How are we equals if you're
always able to exact a price

33:14.735 --> 33:17.486
for me wanting something
outside of work?

33:17.521 --> 33:19.688
William: I know you're angry,
and rightly so,

33:19.740 --> 33:22.408
but eventually you will see
that this is for the best.

33:22.443 --> 33:24.260
I am saving you from that man.

33:24.295 --> 33:28.364
Virginia: "That man" is someone
that I could be happy with.

33:28.416 --> 33:30.616
William: I-I really don't
think so, Virginia.

33:30.668 --> 33:32.201
Virginia:
And-- and why is that?

33:32.203 --> 33:34.286
Because of the kind of man
you <i> think</i> he is,

33:34.338 --> 33:36.939
or because I'm just not entitled
to a life outside of work?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.874

you're entitled to one.

33:38.876 --> 33:39.925
You just don't want one.

33:41.963 --> 33:43.212

That was the argument

33:43.214 --> 33:44.680
that you made to me
in the hospital,

33:44.715 --> 33:46.181
when I was in labor,

33:46.217 --> 33:50.019
that-- that my ambivalence
is the problem,

33:50.054 --> 33:52.354
that I should embrace
the part of me

33:52.390 --> 33:54.223
that cares about work
above all else.

33:54.225 --> 33:58.360
Hell, I thought you meant that.

34:00.147 --> 34:03.666
But I see now the person that
argument really serves is you,

34:03.701 --> 34:06.819
that you were just
looking out for yourself.

34:53.284 --> 34:55.784
You need a partner,
not a project.

34:55.786 --> 34:59.788
And I'm a project.

keep you tethered to your desk?

35:53.427 --> 35:55.010
I said what I did

35:55.062 --> 35:57.179
because you needed permission
to stop hating yourself.

35:57.181 --> 36:00.516
Virginia: - I don't hate myself.
William: - No?

36:00.568 --> 36:02.851
You want to want a man,
Virginia,

36:02.903 --> 36:05.687
because, as unconventional
as you consider yourself,

36:05.740 --> 36:07.022
you're still
your mother's daughter,

36:07.024 --> 36:09.408

you need one to be happy.

36:09.443 --> 36:10.993

36:11.028 --> 36:12.828
A relationship
will never satisfy you

36:12.863 --> 36:14.630
the way your work will.

36:14.665 --> 36:17.032
It lights you up.

36:17.084 --> 36:19.835
It gives you a purpose
so much more consequential

than waiting
for a man to come home.

if there's lipstick on it?

36:25.593 --> 36:28.710
That is too small a life
for you, Virginia,

you have to offer the world.

that got him in trouble?

Libby: It's not about
what you said, Johnny.

It's about how people
took what you said.

that I started it,
and it's just...

another reason to hate me.

Your father doesn't hate you.

dad to spend more time with me.

you wouldn't have to ask.

he might hurt.

the things

didn't like his father.

Why? What did he do?

about being a good father.

39:17.548 --> 39:19.965
He was an angry man,

39:20.017 --> 39:21.850
and he didn't know
what to do with his anger,

39:21.885 --> 39:28.807
so it came out in ways
that hurt daddy.

he left home so early.

at each other forever

knee with a ring in my pocket,

you're imagining.

48:10.330 --> 48:12.714
No, the marriage
I proposed to her

48:12.749 --> 48:15.967
was a marriage of the mind,
a true intellectual partnership,

48:16.002 --> 48:18.470
and I did it
without uttering a word.

48:18.505 --> 48:21.506
All I did was
put her name next to mine

we presented at Wash U.

become-- Masters and Johnson.

48:34.604 --> 48:37.021

48:46.917 --> 48:49.250
William: Hm. Perhaps.

48:49.286 --> 48:51.886
Which is why I've decided
to give her my name.

48:51.922 --> 48:55.590
Just my name--
no "MD" after it--

48:55.625 --> 48:59.093
and put it together with hers
on the next book.

Kind of a renewal
of our vows.

Dan: And you think that's gonna
make a difference?

49:05.302 --> 49:08.136
It's a little too late.
You've pushed her too far, no?

49:08.138 --> 49:10.221
William:
Well, in my experience,

49:10.273 --> 49:12.774
when the train
is pulling out of the station

49:12.809 --> 49:15.810
and you're not on it,
you run twice as fast

49:15.862 --> 49:19.147

it doesn't leave without you.

at chess, Bill.

49:26.990 --> 49:28.356

you'd probably have
the whole game figured out

49:30.877 --> 49:33.628
before I even made
my opening gambit.

William:
It's quite possible.

49:37.100 --> 49:41.336
Dan: Mm. All this strategizing,
it's exhausting.

49:41.388 --> 49:44.105
You must be really tired.

to get what you want.

Dan: Tell her
how you feel about her.

occurred to you, did it, Bill?

50:07.764 --> 50:13.368

It occurred to me.
