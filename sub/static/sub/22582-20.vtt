00:19.407 --> 00:20.886
Bridge to Mayweather.

00:33.967 --> 00:34.956
Mayweather.

00:35.087 --> 00:37.157
The Captain wants you
to report to the Bridge.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.518
Admiral Forrest called a few
minutes ago. We're reversing course.

00:40.847 --> 00:41.996
I'm on my way.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.327
It's been a long road

00:49.687 --> 00:51.723
Gettin' from there to here

00:53.167 --> 00:55.965
It's been a long time

00:56.847 --> 01:00.317
But my time is finally near

01:00.807 --> 01:04.197
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:04.967 --> 01:07.800
I will touch the sky

01:08.207 --> 01:11.836
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:11.967 --> 01:14.959
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:15.087 --> 01:19.319
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:19.447 --> 01:22.484
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:22.607 --> 01:26.759
I've got faith to believe

01:27.007 --> 01:29.965
I can do anything

01:30.087 --> 01:33.796
I've got strength of the soul

01:34.407 --> 01:37.399
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:37.527 --> 01:41.725
I can reach any star

01:42.887 --> 01:44.878
I've got faith

01:46.727 --> 01:49.844
I've got faith

01:50.407 --> 01:53.683
Faith of the heart

02:07.567 --> 02:10.717
The planet's orbit has shifted,
taking it between two gas giants.

02:10.847 --> 02:13.520
Their gravitational pull
is causing its core to superheat.

02:13.647 --> 02:16.400
Starfleet thinks it'll be covered
with erupting volcanoes...

02:16.527 --> 02:17.926
by the end of the week.

02:18.487 --> 02:21.047
This system's
almost 30 light-years behind us.

02:21.487 --> 02:24.399
Admiral Forrest assures me
it's only a temporary detour.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.316
Some geologic fireworks.
Could be fun.

02:29.127 --> 02:30.765
- Set a course.
- Aye, sir.

02:47.927 --> 02:48.962
Come in.

02:51.447 --> 02:54.007
- Do you have a minute, sir?
- Several, actually.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.043
Please. What's on your mind?

02:58.407 --> 03:01.240
I was wondering
if I could make a personal request.

03:01.607 --> 03:02.642
Of course.

03:03.327 --> 03:05.636
My family's ship, the Horizon...

03:06.087 --> 03:08.317
we're going to be passing close to it.

03:08.647 --> 03:12.845
I wouldn't mind going by for a visit.
It's about 10 hours off our flight path.

03:13.447 --> 03:16.439
Enterprise can still get to the planet
with time to spare.

03:16.887 --> 03:19.162
You could pick me up on the way back.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.081
I think we can manage without you
for a few days.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.161
Thank you, sir.

03:24.647 --> 03:27.002
Your folks will be surprised to see you.

03:27.447 --> 03:29.563
My father's been ill for a few months.

03:30.247 --> 03:31.805
Nothing serious, I hope.

03:31.927 --> 03:34.839
My mother said he'll be fine.
She's the ship's medic.

03:35.887 --> 03:38.959
I thought you told me your mother
was the chief engineer.

03:39.447 --> 03:40.516
She's both.

03:42.847 --> 03:46.283
I guess they have to wear a lot of hats
to keep those old ships running.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.279
My grandfather held the record:

03:48.407 --> 03:51.319
Five jobs at one time,
two of them on the Bridge.

03:52.287 --> 03:53.686
There was a time...

03:54.607 --> 03:57.485
when I gave serious thought
to serving on a cargo ship.

03:58.287 --> 03:59.276
You, sir?

04:00.407 --> 04:03.046
It was a few years
before Starfleet was chartered.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.919
Why didn't you sign up?

04:06.727 --> 04:07.796
Long story.

04:08.607 --> 04:11.075
I'll tell you
the next time we have breakfast.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.641
After we dock,
I'll have Phlox go over with you...

04:14.767 --> 04:16.723
have him take a look at your father.

04:16.846 --> 04:18.485
I'd appreciate that, sir.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.000
You'll be glad to hear the thermal
scanners are up and running.

04:30.127 --> 04:31.958
- And the imaging relays?
- Yep.

04:32.127 --> 04:33.845
We'll drop six of them in high orbit.

04:33.967 --> 04:37.243
That should give us a bird's-eye view
of every volcano on the planet.

04:38.247 --> 04:41.125
You know, there's not going to be
a lot to do once we get there.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.397
Sensors will record
everything automatically.

04:43.527 --> 04:46.519
You should have plenty of time
to practice your harmonica.

04:49.487 --> 04:51.876
I've talked Chef
into doing something special.

04:52.647 --> 04:55.878
Starting Tuesday,
it's going to be movie night every night.

04:56.007 --> 04:59.124
Thought you might be interested,
seeing how you enjoyed that western.

04:59.247 --> 05:02.956
We're going to be showing the three
greatest horror movies ever made.

05:03.207 --> 05:04.401
Frankenstein...

05:04.767 --> 05:07.486
Bride of Frankenstein
and Son of Frankenstein.

05:08.127 --> 05:11.164
We might even throw in
Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.843
I have no interest in horror movies.

05:15.087 --> 05:17.317
How do you know
if you've never seen one?

05:18.927 --> 05:22.237
You don't have to see all of them.
Just come the first night.

05:22.847 --> 05:24.485
I promise you'll like it.

05:25.007 --> 05:26.599
Reanimated life forms...

05:27.087 --> 05:28.486
science run amok...

05:29.327 --> 05:31.124
they're right up your alley.

05:35.087 --> 05:36.725
Four years isn't so long.

05:37.007 --> 05:38.838
My last family reunion was...

05:39.447 --> 05:40.880
almost a decade ago.

05:42.087 --> 05:45.602
Starfleet really ought to think
about putting families on starships.

05:45.727 --> 05:47.126
You must be joking.

05:47.527 --> 05:49.404
No one would ever get homesick.

05:49.527 --> 05:52.439
Yes. Well, they'd better post
a psychologist on board...

05:52.567 --> 05:55.764
because I'd need one if my parents
were roaming the corridors.

05:56.287 --> 05:58.562
On a cargo ship,
you can't walk 10 metres...

05:58.687 --> 06:01.599
without running into your babysitter
or a great-aunt.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.839
Bridge to Ensign Mayweather.

06:06.487 --> 06:07.522
Go ahead.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.605
We've gotten a response
from the Horizon. It's your mother.

06:10.727 --> 06:13.036
Thanks, Hoshi.
Put it through to my quarters.

06:17.327 --> 06:20.080
Captain's personal log,
January 10, 2153.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.315
We're on course
for our rendezvous with the Horizon.

06:23.447 --> 06:24.482
Unfortunately...

06:24.607 --> 06:27.360
I've just received word
that Ensign Mayweather's family...

06:27.487 --> 06:29.125
is facing an unexpected tragedy.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.885
- Mind if I join you?
- Of course not.

06:42.407 --> 06:44.557
I haven't been up here
since we launched.

06:56.647 --> 06:57.966
Come here a lot?

06:59.607 --> 07:01.006
Every now and then.

07:04.327 --> 07:06.363
Commander. Tucker told me
what happened.

07:08.007 --> 07:09.042
I'm sorry.

07:11.647 --> 07:14.878
My mother sent a message to Starfleet
six weeks ago.

07:16.927 --> 07:18.326
But I never got it.

07:23.727 --> 07:25.604
The civilian channels can be...

07:27.407 --> 07:28.522
pretty slow.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.325
I should've called him.

07:33.247 --> 07:35.442
We were in comm range
a few months ago.

07:37.607 --> 07:41.236
I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet.

07:42.767 --> 07:45.679
He wasn't very happy with me
when I joined Starfleet.

07:47.407 --> 07:49.523
He'd been grooming me for his job...

07:51.087 --> 07:52.440
since I was a kid.

07:53.727 --> 07:54.796
I'm sure...

07:57.207 --> 07:59.402
it wasn't easy for him when you left.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.239
But I know for a fact...

08:04.967 --> 08:06.605
that he was proud of you.

08:11.327 --> 08:12.919
With all respect, sir...

08:16.047 --> 08:17.639
I'm not so sure he was.

08:20.887 --> 08:23.606
Did he ever tell you
about the letter he sent me?

08:26.247 --> 08:28.602
It was almost two-and-a-half years ago.

08:29.767 --> 08:33.043
There were a few candidates
I was looking at for helm officer.

08:34.327 --> 08:36.716
I was having a little trouble deciding...

08:37.967 --> 08:42.039
so I contacted their former C.O. S,
hoping for a more personal evaluation.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.041
What did he say?

08:46.007 --> 08:48.202
He wrote the shortest recommendation.

08:48.847 --> 08:50.200
Just one sentence.

08:52.207 --> 08:53.242
He said...

08:55.167 --> 08:58.762
he'd never met a more natural
stick-and-rudder man in his life...

09:00.327 --> 09:03.285
and I'd be a fool if I didn't choose you.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.200
When I saw how you handled yourself
at the helm...

09:12.967 --> 09:14.400
I knew he was right.

09:15.647 --> 09:16.682
I wish...

09:19.967 --> 09:21.958
he would've told me that.

09:28.047 --> 09:30.959
As I suspected, it's nothing more
than a simple headache.

09:31.087 --> 09:33.203
I was hoping
for something more serious.

09:35.127 --> 09:37.595
I've been coerced
into watching tonight's movie.

09:37.727 --> 09:40.560
If you're looking for a medical excuse,
you're out of luck.

09:40.687 --> 09:42.564
If it's any consolation, I'll be there, too.

09:42.687 --> 09:44.996
I agree, this form of entertainment
is rather crude...

09:45.127 --> 09:48.437
but it can often provide an enlightening
glimpse into human behaviour.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.559
Don't be surprised
if you see me here again afterwards.

09:52.647 --> 09:54.956
I've little doubt my headache will return.

10:01.087 --> 10:03.760
Just a quick tour of the Engine Room.
That's all I'm asking.

10:03.887 --> 10:05.525
The Horizon is 50 years old.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.846
I'm sure you've seen
far more impressive warp reactors.

10:08.967 --> 10:11.527
Zefram Cochrane
designed that engine himself.

10:12.087 --> 10:15.397
I've heard rumours that he signed
the inside of each reactor casing.

10:18.007 --> 10:19.156
Almost forgot.

10:20.527 --> 10:22.643
- What's this?
- A few family photos.

10:23.287 --> 10:26.120
I downloaded every picture I've taken
since we left Spacedock.

10:26.407 --> 10:29.205
Thought your mum might like to see
what her boy's been up to.

10:29.727 --> 10:31.365
- Thank you, sir.
- You bet.

10:54.247 --> 10:56.283
I wouldn't call it a dangerous mission.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.877
We've gotten into a few skirmishes,
but nothing we couldn't handle.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.965
I got a letter from your sister.

11:02.087 --> 11:05.238
She said you'd mentioned a close call
with some kind of storm.

11:05.927 --> 11:08.282
We ran into a small wave front
a few months ago.

11:08.407 --> 11:11.683
The crew had to squeeze into one
of the nacelles for a couple of days.

11:11.807 --> 11:14.321
She probably made it sound
worse than it was.

11:15.047 --> 11:19.040
She also mentioned something about
alien soldiers forcing their way aboard.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.158
It was really just a misunderstanding.

11:22.287 --> 11:24.357
They thought Enterprise
had been abandoned.

11:24.487 --> 11:26.682
Captain Archer convinced
them to leave.

11:28.527 --> 11:32.122
I guess there's no point in asking you
about the Romulan minefield.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.039
How did you know about that?

11:34.167 --> 11:36.920
I've been serving on cargo ships
for a long time.

11:37.047 --> 11:39.163
I've made a few contacts
here and there.

11:39.927 --> 11:41.440
Stand by to go to warp.

11:50.647 --> 11:53.605
- Charlie must be at the helm.
- What makes you say that?

11:54.647 --> 11:57.036
His warp jumps
were always a little rough.

11:58.407 --> 12:00.204
- Where are we headed?
- Deneva Station.

12:00.327 --> 12:04.115
Just a quick run to pick up supplies.
We'll have you back in plenty of time.

12:04.247 --> 12:05.760
Watch your step, ma'am.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.595
- Travis?
- Hey.

12:08.407 --> 12:09.965
Haven't seen you for a while.

12:10.087 --> 12:12.396
Did you lock yourself
in a cargo container again?

12:12.527 --> 12:14.643
Do you always have to bring that up?

12:16.647 --> 12:19.878
It's good to see you. If you're not busy
tonight, stop by the mess.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.042
I will.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.359
Did you forget your way?

12:28.927 --> 12:32.522
- Guest quarters are over here.
- You're not assigned to guest quarters.

12:39.847 --> 12:42.077
I thought my room had been reassigned.

12:42.247 --> 12:45.319
It was, but they didn't mind
giving it up for a few days.

12:45.447 --> 12:47.483
We don't get VIPs very often.

12:50.247 --> 12:53.683
I found some of your old things,
thought you might feel more at home.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.484
I can't believe you kept this.

12:59.647 --> 13:01.877
You stayed up all night for a month...

13:02.287 --> 13:05.484
mapping every system
you planned to visit when you grew up.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.564
I've still got a ways to go.

13:11.487 --> 13:13.045
I'm glad you're home.

13:15.487 --> 13:16.522
Me, too.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.083
We're going to get through this, Mum.

13:29.327 --> 13:32.842
Those plasma injectors
aren't going to align themselves.

13:34.807 --> 13:35.922
I should go.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.556
After you've settled in,
come by the Engine Room.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.359
Some people want to say hello.

13:58.847 --> 14:01.361
Transfer these canisters
over to Module 4.

14:02.807 --> 14:05.526
Are you sure you're old enough
to drive that thing?

14:07.967 --> 14:10.925
An ensign ought to salute
before addressing a captain.

14:11.167 --> 14:14.000
Acting captain.
Don't let it go to your head.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.962
I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.

14:28.487 --> 14:30.717
- Jacket looks good on you.
- Thanks.

14:33.087 --> 14:35.362
Didn't think I'd be wearing it this soon.

14:40.007 --> 14:43.602
Business must be good.
I've never seen this module so full.

14:44.807 --> 14:48.004
The biggest problem these days
is keeping track of everything.

14:48.127 --> 14:50.595
Dad kept a lot of the inventory
in his head.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.283
I'm trying to reconstruct the database.

14:54.407 --> 14:58.446
Still can't find the stromatopod larvae
we have to deliver to the Demerians.

14:59.447 --> 15:02.041
I only hope they didn't end up
in cold storage.

15:02.847 --> 15:05.566
- Lf you need me to help with anything...
- Thanks...

15:06.247 --> 15:07.600
but we can handle it.

15:08.927 --> 15:11.760
You're on leave.
I'm not going to put you to work.

15:15.087 --> 15:16.236
See you at dinner?

15:20.647 --> 15:21.682
Travis...

15:22.927 --> 15:26.044
you might want to change
into something a little less conspicuous.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.038
I've deployed the imaging relays.

15:49.167 --> 15:52.762
- How long until the show begins?
- Approximately 30 hours.

15:53.527 --> 15:55.995
The holometric camera
still needs to be calibrated.

15:56.127 --> 15:57.606
I can help with that.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.202
Get started.

15:59.807 --> 16:02.275
I'd like to share our pictures
with Starfleet...

16:02.927 --> 16:04.997
give Admiral Forrest a front-row seat.

16:05.607 --> 16:06.960
Echo Three's within range.

16:07.087 --> 16:09.078
It shouldn't be too hard
to set up a downlink.

16:11.367 --> 16:12.800
So, you coming tonight?

16:15.127 --> 16:17.118
If these sensors are calibrated by then.

16:17.247 --> 16:20.717
You'd better make up your mind.
Seats are going to fill up fast.

16:22.727 --> 16:26.720
According to the database,
Frankenstein is also a work of literature.

16:27.007 --> 16:29.521
Mary Shelley wrote it,
the wife of a famous poet.

16:30.847 --> 16:33.680
Perhaps a dramatic reading
would be more illuminating.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.082
You expect a mess hall
full of crewmen to sit still...

16:37.207 --> 16:38.640
while someone reads to them?

16:38.927 --> 16:42.237
They'd be more likely to appreciate
the author's true intent.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.839
You want to start a book club...

16:46.687 --> 16:47.722
go right ahead.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.996
You're going to be there tonight,
aren't you, sir?

16:51.287 --> 16:52.606
Wouldn't miss it.

16:53.727 --> 16:55.479
I'll save you some popcorn.

17:01.447 --> 17:03.642
Might be a good idea for you to go, too.

17:04.007 --> 17:07.079
It might be fun,
and a little fraternising couldn't hurt.

17:10.047 --> 17:13.517
I don't understand how sitting silently
in a darkened room...

17:13.646 --> 17:15.285
constitutes fraternising.

17:16.686 --> 17:17.801
It's a...

17:19.127 --> 17:20.560
communal experience.

17:22.847 --> 17:24.246
I'll tell you what.

17:24.887 --> 17:26.319
Let's make a night of it.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.644
Dinner in the Captain's Mess 1800,
movie at 1930.

17:29.807 --> 17:31.160
You'll be my date.

17:31.487 --> 17:33.876
- I beg your pardon?
- I'll be a perfect gentleman.

17:34.527 --> 17:36.597
And if you don't like the movie...

17:37.167 --> 17:39.522
I'll never ask you
to sit through another one.

17:52.247 --> 17:53.362
All right...

17:55.007 --> 17:56.076
try it now.

18:01.527 --> 18:04.087
I've increased the range
of the navigation sensors.

18:04.207 --> 18:06.596
The helm will make
course corrections a lot quicker.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.244
- What's wrong?
- I'm just working on a few upgrades.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.396
I don't remember asking
for any upgrades.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.917
You were busy.
I didn't want to bother you.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.686
You're going to love this.

18:22.807 --> 18:25.560
You know those port stabilisers
that were always acting up?

18:25.847 --> 18:27.883
Before I left, I spoke to
Commander Tucker.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.076
Commander Tucker?

18:29.767 --> 18:31.803
Our chief engineer, on Enterprise.

18:31.967 --> 18:35.164
He showed me how to reconfigure
the spatial discriminators.

18:35.327 --> 18:37.283
Shouldn't give you any more trouble.

18:39.367 --> 18:42.518
What's going to happen if these
improvements of yours go off-line?

18:43.807 --> 18:46.844
You'll be back on your Starfleet ship,
out of comm range.

18:47.407 --> 18:48.920
Who's going to fix it?

18:50.967 --> 18:55.279
I'd prefer it if you didn't modify any more
systems without discussing it with me.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.159
Whatever you say, sir.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.396
Maybe you can stop by Engineering...

19:04.647 --> 19:06.444
build us a warp 5 engine.

19:23.687 --> 19:24.676
Come in.

19:26.407 --> 19:28.045
I heard we had a visitor.

19:29.447 --> 19:30.675
Word travels fast.

19:35.727 --> 19:37.683
I still can't believe he's gone.

19:38.447 --> 19:41.041
- I'm so sorry, Travis.
- Thanks.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.318
Aren't you a little old for this?

19:47.047 --> 19:48.196
I don't know.

19:48.367 --> 19:51.040
I thought it might be fun
to regress for a while.

19:51.167 --> 19:54.204
What do you say we turn off
the grav-plating and jump on the bed?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.726
And get grounded again?

19:56.527 --> 19:59.041
That wouldn't look too good
on your Starfleet record.

20:01.007 --> 20:02.007
- How's Enterprise?
- Keeps us busy.

20:02.007 --> 20:03.679
- How's Enterprise?
- Keeps us busy.

20:04.287 --> 20:08.724
We've gone 150 light-years,
seen 22 inhabited worlds.

20:09.247 --> 20:12.523
- In 18 months?
- You can't believe what's out there.

20:13.687 --> 20:16.155
Columbus, Magellan,
Travis Mayweather.

20:17.847 --> 20:20.361
- How long are you home for?
- Just a few days.

20:21.047 --> 20:23.117
Any chance of getting
an extended leave?

20:23.247 --> 20:24.441
I'm afraid not.

20:25.047 --> 20:27.481
I doubt Magellan
got much time off, either.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.316
What's wrong?

20:34.127 --> 20:36.118
I don't mean to spoil your visit...

20:36.247 --> 20:37.202
but...

20:37.567 --> 20:41.276
things haven't exactly been running
like clockwork since your father died.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.726
What do you mean?

20:43.047 --> 20:46.357
We missed a rendezvous
with an Orion freighter two weeks ago.

20:46.527 --> 20:48.802
The Cargo Authority wasn't too pleased.

20:49.087 --> 20:50.520
We're also low on deuterium.

20:50.647 --> 20:53.525
We've had to dip into the reserves
twice this month.

20:54.207 --> 20:56.038
Morale has been better, Travis.

20:56.847 --> 20:58.678
Horizon has lost its captain...

20:59.447 --> 21:00.402
and...

21:00.607 --> 21:04.566
some of the crew are starting to wonder
if Paul's ready for the job.

21:06.087 --> 21:08.920
You might have noticed,
he's been a little on edge.

21:09.647 --> 21:12.639
- He's always on edge.
- More than usual.

21:14.927 --> 21:18.761
- My mother hasn't mentioned this.
- I guess she didn't want to worry you.

21:22.007 --> 21:24.123
He's only been in command
a few weeks.

21:24.247 --> 21:26.477
Give him a chance. He'll grow into it.

21:27.247 --> 21:28.680
I hope you're right.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.555
I'm sure this is the last thing
you wanted to hear now.

21:31.687 --> 21:33.678
- I thought you should know.
- Thanks.

21:35.967 --> 21:39.039
- Charlie at the helm?
- Just a little spatial turbulence.

21:39.607 --> 21:41.677
You've gotten spoiled on Enterprise.

21:45.247 --> 21:46.441
That's no turbulence.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.127
Hull fracture in Module 3.
We're venting atmosphere.

22:00.247 --> 22:02.203
Seal it off. Try hailing them again.

22:02.967 --> 22:04.480
They're still not responding.

22:05.887 --> 22:08.082
- What's going on?
- We're under attack.

22:08.247 --> 22:09.475
- By who?
- I don't know.

22:09.607 --> 22:11.325
Should I arm the plasma turrets?

22:13.447 --> 22:16.200
No. Transfer reserve power
to the hull plating.

22:18.647 --> 22:21.844
We need to get out of their
weapons range. Go to maximum warp.

22:21.967 --> 22:25.516
You're hauling 30,000 metric tons.
You won't be able to outrun them.

22:25.647 --> 22:27.285
- You heard me.
- Yes, sir.

22:30.647 --> 22:31.716
Warp 1.6...

22:33.047 --> 22:34.082
1.7...

22:35.807 --> 22:36.762
warp 1.8.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.322
- They're still closing.
- A little more.

22:40.927 --> 22:41.996
1.85.

22:50.207 --> 22:52.846
- They're moving off.
- Reduce speed to 1.5.

22:57.967 --> 23:00.720
- They attached something to the hull.
- Show me.

23:05.247 --> 23:08.762
It's emitting a subspace signal.
Could be some kind of beacon.

23:09.767 --> 23:10.916
Call Engineering.

23:11.047 --> 23:13.356
Tell them to get someone out there
to pry it off.

23:13.487 --> 23:15.045
I wouldn't recommend that.

23:17.607 --> 23:19.563
This is a dicobalt signature...

23:20.447 --> 23:22.039
a high-yield explosive.

23:22.607 --> 23:25.360
If anyone gets too close,
it might decide to go off.

23:30.087 --> 23:32.840
The Constellation sent us this.
This ship attacked them...

23:32.967 --> 23:35.481
eight weeks ago,
and it planted a beacon on their hull.

23:35.607 --> 23:38.724
A day later, this cruiser showed up
and demanded their cargo.

23:38.847 --> 23:42.123
The Constellation tried to drive them off,
but the aliens got aboard...

23:42.247 --> 23:45.364
and killed three of their crew.
Then they took the entire shipment.

23:45.487 --> 23:47.796
What kind of weapons
does the Constellation have?

23:47.967 --> 23:50.879
Two plasma turrets, same as us.

23:55.407 --> 23:57.716
There has to be
a way to remove that beacon.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.166
I wouldn't risk it.

24:01.567 --> 24:04.035
If it detonates,
you could lose the nacelle.

24:07.647 --> 24:11.083
If we jettison a few tons of that ore,
can we increase to warp 2?

24:11.847 --> 24:13.280
I don't see why not.

24:13.447 --> 24:16.280
That should allow us to reach
Deneva Station ahead of schedule.

24:16.407 --> 24:18.682
It's well-armed.
We should be safe there.

24:19.127 --> 24:21.402
What happens if they come back
before we arrive?

24:21.527 --> 24:24.644
There's no other choice.
We can't shoot our way out of this.

24:28.607 --> 24:31.201
I've seen this kind
of engine configuration before.

24:31.327 --> 24:34.205
- Not that different from a Mazarite ship.
- Mazarite?

24:35.927 --> 24:37.804
We had some trouble with them.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.395
We knocked out their engines
with our phase cannons.

24:40.527 --> 24:42.324
We don't have phase cannons.

24:44.367 --> 24:47.723
I can tie the plasma turrets
directly into the impulse engines.

24:47.847 --> 24:50.645
Lieutenant Reed did that,
and it increased our yield by 80%.

24:50.767 --> 24:54.965
I'm not going to risk all of our lives
by getting into a fight we can't win.

24:57.527 --> 25:00.121
If they reach us
before we make it to Deneva...

25:01.527 --> 25:03.165
we'll give them what they want.

25:03.287 --> 25:05.926
If there's one thing I've learned
from Captain Archer...

25:06.047 --> 25:08.845
it's that you don't give in
to people like this. You'll only...

25:08.967 --> 25:12.880
encourage more attacks, not just
against you, but other cargo ships.

25:13.287 --> 25:16.199
I appreciate the advice,
but this isn't your problem.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.524
You're not part of this crew anymore.

25:19.447 --> 25:21.802
Jettison that ore
and increase our speed.

25:25.967 --> 25:28.322
Even your father
had to make compromises.

25:29.207 --> 25:32.040
The safest thing to do
is give them what they want.

25:33.807 --> 25:35.320
Cargo can be replaced.

25:45.087 --> 25:46.076
Fool.

25:46.607 --> 25:48.518
If this storm develops as I hope...

25:48.647 --> 25:51.798
you'll have plenty to be afraid
of before the night's over.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.639
Go on. Fix the electrodes.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.198
This storm will be magnificent.

25:57.687 --> 25:59.962
All the electrical secrets of heaven.

26:00.327 --> 26:03.478
This time we're ready, eh, Fritz? Ready.

26:05.807 --> 26:09.356
- What are you doing?
- Reviewing this morning's sensor data.

26:10.607 --> 26:12.837
I thought you were going
to give this a chance.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.800
Just a few stitches.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.835
And look, here's the final touch.

26:19.927 --> 26:21.519
The brain you stole, Fritz.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.038
Think of it. Brain of a...

26:24.287 --> 26:25.879
This Dr Frankenstein...

26:26.007 --> 26:29.158
his technique is not dissimilar
to a practice on B'Saari Two.

26:29.407 --> 26:31.557
They successfully used
an isolytic current...

26:31.687 --> 26:34.155
to reanimate the bodies
of the recently deceased.

26:34.287 --> 26:35.436
- Really?
- Yes.

26:35.847 --> 26:39.965
The revived individuals weren't capable
of more than basic cellular metabolism.

26:40.087 --> 26:42.396
However, the B'Saari have developed
a procedure that...

26:42.527 --> 26:44.518
shows promise
in repairing the synaptic...

26:45.047 --> 26:48.119
We can stop the film
if it's disturbing your conversation.

26:55.887 --> 26:58.606
In 15 minutes,
the storm should be at its height.

26:58.847 --> 27:00.121
Then we'll be ready.

27:09.767 --> 27:10.802
Captain?

27:11.887 --> 27:14.355
Looks like someone's rerouting
the impulse relays.

27:14.487 --> 27:15.522
Where?

27:16.887 --> 27:19.037
- Module 5.
- You have the Bridge.

27:29.567 --> 27:31.444
I thought I made myself clear.

27:32.327 --> 27:34.443
If those aliens come back,
you'll thank me.

27:34.567 --> 27:37.206
I told you, I'm not going to take
this ship into battle.

27:37.327 --> 27:38.476
You may not have a choice.

27:38.607 --> 27:42.122
I didn't ask for your opinion,
and I didn't approve your modifications.

27:42.247 --> 27:43.600
Stop what you're doing.

27:43.727 --> 27:45.160
- Paul...
- You heard me.

27:47.247 --> 27:49.238
I didn't mean to undermine
your authority.

27:49.367 --> 27:50.402
Really?

27:50.527 --> 27:52.358
But you're being unreasonable.

27:52.487 --> 27:55.047
- I just want us to be prepared.
- Us?

27:55.327 --> 27:57.716
You keep talking
as if you're a part of this crew.

27:57.847 --> 27:58.916
It's still my home.

27:59.047 --> 28:01.197
You turned your back on us
a long time ago.

28:01.327 --> 28:04.046
Is that what this is about? Me leaving?

28:06.007 --> 28:08.157
If you want to be an effective captain...

28:08.287 --> 28:10.881
you've got to set
your personal feelings aside...

28:11.127 --> 28:13.482
listen to what other people have to say.

28:14.247 --> 28:16.363
More words of wisdom from Starfleet?

28:17.287 --> 28:19.437
No, your father.

28:20.847 --> 28:22.917
He said that to me a long time ago.

28:23.047 --> 28:25.720
If he was here now,
he'd tell you the same thing.

28:26.087 --> 28:27.361
You quoting Dad?

28:28.687 --> 28:29.881
You never listened to him.

28:30.007 --> 28:32.396
If you had, you wouldn't have
abandoned your family.

28:32.527 --> 28:34.995
You barely spoke to him
for the last four years.

28:36.727 --> 28:38.683
You weren't even here when he died.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.641
That isn't fair.

28:44.127 --> 28:45.719
You knew he was sick...

28:47.647 --> 28:49.365
but you didn't really care.

28:50.687 --> 28:54.157
You only decided to stop by
because it was convenient for you.

28:55.007 --> 28:58.761
Hostile aliens aren't our problem.
It's Starfleet and people like you.

28:59.527 --> 29:02.564
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to find new crewmen?

29:03.967 --> 29:06.083
No one wants to run freight anymore.

29:07.607 --> 29:09.325
They all want to be explorers...

29:09.447 --> 29:13.281
cruising around on state-of-the-art ships
with their personal chefs.

29:14.847 --> 29:18.078
You want to stand around
feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead.

29:18.607 --> 29:20.359
I've got better things to do.

29:21.887 --> 29:24.447
Take those upgrades off-line.

29:26.687 --> 29:29.042
I'll confine you to quarters if I have to.

29:29.287 --> 29:31.084
I'm just trying to help you, Paul.

29:31.207 --> 29:34.358
In case you haven't noticed,
you could use a little help right now.

29:34.487 --> 29:36.079
I don't want your help.

29:37.127 --> 29:39.925
You want to take them off-line?
Do it yourself.

30:01.207 --> 30:04.961
I understand you made a few
modifications to the impulse relays.

30:08.087 --> 30:11.682
Next time you might want to check
with me. I am the chief engineer.

30:12.047 --> 30:15.039
I knew how Paul would react.
I didn't want to drag you into it.

30:16.287 --> 30:19.757
I've played referee between you
and your brother for a long time.

30:21.527 --> 30:23.802
I never thought I'd actually miss these.

30:23.927 --> 30:25.042
Nutri-paks?

30:25.607 --> 30:28.838
Not just any Nutri-pak,
strawberry shortcake.

30:30.647 --> 30:33.923
The first time I tasted real shortcake
was in San Francisco.

30:35.087 --> 30:36.679
It just wasn't the same.

30:38.527 --> 30:40.643
I think they have ruined your taste buds.

30:42.087 --> 30:44.362
I wouldn't mind eating like this again.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.440
I'm thinking about asking
for an extended leave.

30:50.207 --> 30:53.085
I'm sure Captain Archer
would approve, considering.

30:54.807 --> 30:57.526
- How long would you stay?
- As long as I'm needed.

30:57.807 --> 30:59.718
But you're needed on your ship.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.404
I'm not the only helm officer.

31:02.807 --> 31:05.640
Even if your captain agrees,
it could be a long time before...

31:05.767 --> 31:09.043
- Enterprise is back this way again.
- There's a lot for me to do here.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.727
I can help upgrade
the guidance and warp systems.

31:11.847 --> 31:15.760
With a little luck, we could make
Horizon the fastest J-class in the fleet.

31:15.887 --> 31:18.401
You're going to give up your career,
move back home...

31:18.527 --> 31:20.119
and take orders from your brother?

31:20.247 --> 31:22.886
My career is the last thing
on my mind right now.

31:23.007 --> 31:26.443
Congratulations. Now you know
what it's like to be a parent.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.804
I could spend every waking minute
worrying about you two...

31:32.887 --> 31:34.843
but I'd never get any work done.

31:35.967 --> 31:37.366
He's not ready, Mum.

31:40.407 --> 31:43.126
You should have seen your father
when he took over.

31:43.247 --> 31:45.636
He was a year younger
than Paul is now.

31:46.687 --> 31:50.282
He was an engineer. He didn't know
the first thing about running a Bridge.

31:50.447 --> 31:54.486
We fell so far behind schedule,
he almost lost his E.C.A. Licence.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.877
He wanted to quit. I wouldn't let him.

31:59.447 --> 32:01.483
Your brother just needs some time.

32:03.167 --> 32:05.044
You don't think I should stay.

32:06.127 --> 32:08.004
Didn't we have this conversation?

32:08.127 --> 32:10.516
It was right here in this room,
four years ago...

32:10.647 --> 32:12.797
when you first thought
about joining Starfleet.

32:12.927 --> 32:15.077
A lot has changed in four years, Mum.

32:15.207 --> 32:17.721
That's true,
and a lot more's going to change.

32:18.367 --> 32:21.518
Will we be talking about this again
in another four years?

32:23.727 --> 32:26.605
You're the helmsman
of the first warp 5 starship.

32:28.287 --> 32:29.606
I'm proud of you.

32:30.887 --> 32:35.005
Everyone here is, even Paul,
though he won't admit it.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.167
If you'll indulge a little motherly advice...

32:40.367 --> 32:43.325
don't let your guilt over leaving
guide your decision.

32:45.007 --> 32:46.759
I'll try to keep that in mind.

32:49.807 --> 32:51.365
- Good night.
- Night.

33:02.367 --> 33:05.837
I find it hard to believe that no one
on Vulcan has heard of a horror movie.

33:05.967 --> 33:07.798
There is something similar...

33:07.967 --> 33:10.242
a discipline known as tarul-etek.

33:10.687 --> 33:14.441
It uses disturbing imagery
to provoke an emotional response.

33:15.207 --> 33:16.845
They try and scare you...

33:17.567 --> 33:19.762
to see how well
you suppress your emotions.

33:19.887 --> 33:24.244
I don't understand why humans would
feel compelled to frighten themselves.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.359
Gets the heart pumping.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.880
Cardiovascular activity
would be more efficient.

33:33.047 --> 33:35.720
You never did give us
your opinion of the movie.

33:37.927 --> 33:40.122
There were many medical inaccuracies.

33:40.647 --> 33:42.444
What did you think of the story?

33:47.447 --> 33:49.403
I thought the protagonist
was interesting.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.360
- Dr Frankenstein.
- No, his creation.

33:54.047 --> 33:56.880
From my perspective,
this was the story of an individual...

33:57.007 --> 33:59.396
persecuted by humans
because he was different.

34:00.807 --> 34:02.479
That's one way of looking at it.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.167
In many ways,
the film seemed quite prophetic.

34:06.647 --> 34:08.683
The reaction of the villagers,
for example.

34:08.806 --> 34:12.482
It was similar to the reception
Vulcans received after landing on Earth.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.085
I don't recall...

34:16.607 --> 34:20.043
anyone greeting a Vulcan ambassador
with torches and pitchforks.

34:20.487 --> 34:23.559
Nevertheless, many humans reacted
with fear and anger.

34:24.246 --> 34:26.043
They didn't know what to expect.

34:28.007 --> 34:31.079
I'm going to recommend
that Ambassador Soval watch the film.

34:31.206 --> 34:32.400
You're kidding.

34:32.887 --> 34:36.482
I believe it would help Vulcans
who've recently arrived on Earth.

34:39.407 --> 34:42.603
Maybe inviting her to movie night
wasn't such a great idea.

34:43.327 --> 34:46.558
On the contrary. I'm looking forward
to Bride of Frankenstein.

34:47.967 --> 34:49.559
Bridge to Captain Archer.

34:50.806 --> 34:51.876
Go ahead.

34:52.087 --> 34:54.282
You might want to look
out the window, sir.

35:06.447 --> 35:07.516
Thermal shear.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.161
Some of those eruptions
are getting close to Enterprise.

35:10.287 --> 35:12.482
- Take us up another 5,000 kilometres.
- Aye, sir.

35:12.607 --> 35:13.642
Captain...

35:14.487 --> 35:18.321
I'm reading bio-signs on the planet.
To quote Dr Frankenstein, "It's alive."

35:19.167 --> 35:20.646
I thought it was uninhabited.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.837
It appears
that several microbial species...

35:22.967 --> 35:26.164
which live underground are being
unearthed by the volcanic activity.

35:26.287 --> 35:27.959
See what you can learn about them.

35:33.687 --> 35:35.359
Full power to the hull plating.

35:36.207 --> 35:37.526
We're being hailed.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.202
This is Captain Mayweather
of the ECS Horizon.

35:42.327 --> 35:45.558
Prepare to surrender your vessel
and evacuate the crew.

35:47.007 --> 35:49.043
I'll give you our cargo, but not our ship.

35:49.167 --> 35:52.762
You won't be harmed, if you cooperate.
Drop out of warp.

35:53.007 --> 35:55.157
We're dozens of light-years
from our home world.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.562
There has to be some compromise
we can...

35:58.607 --> 36:00.120
They're charging weapons.

36:04.487 --> 36:08.196
Bring the weapon upgrades online. Still
think you can disable their engines?

36:08.327 --> 36:09.646
If I can get a clear shot...

36:09.767 --> 36:12.076
but I can't do that
as long as they're behind us.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.000
They've hit Module 5.

36:15.127 --> 36:18.199
It's going to be tough to manoeuvre
with 30 kilotons of cargo.

36:18.327 --> 36:19.919
We've got to cut it loose.

36:26.447 --> 36:29.325
Engineering,
stand by to release the primary clamps.

36:29.767 --> 36:31.644
You do remember how to fly this ship?

36:33.127 --> 36:34.879
I'm sure it'll come back to me.

36:38.847 --> 36:40.280
Take us out of warp.

36:45.847 --> 36:47.246
Release the clamps.

36:49.887 --> 36:51.081
They're closing.

36:51.647 --> 36:52.762
40 metres...

36:53.007 --> 36:53.962
30.

36:54.287 --> 36:55.720
Just a few more clamps.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.916
10 metres.

37:10.647 --> 37:11.921
Starboard plating is down.

37:12.047 --> 37:13.002
Travis.

37:25.287 --> 37:26.720
Hull plating is gone.

37:27.207 --> 37:28.640
I'm coming around again.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.925
Their weapons are going down.

37:38.207 --> 37:40.721
Keep our turrets locked on them.
Open a channel.

37:42.047 --> 37:43.560
This is Captain Mayweather.

37:43.967 --> 37:47.084
I'd think twice before attacking
any of our ships again.

37:48.287 --> 37:51.279
Re-dock with the cargo section,
then get us out of here.

37:52.527 --> 37:53.676
Aye, Captain.

38:07.807 --> 38:08.796
Come in.

38:13.447 --> 38:14.516
All packed?

38:15.527 --> 38:17.483
Wouldn't want to wear out my welcome.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.639
I got a message from Enterprise.
They're running ahead of schedule.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.837
We'll be docking in about 20 minutes.

38:25.447 --> 38:27.324
If you'd like, I'll speak with
Lieutenant Reed.

38:27.447 --> 38:30.086
I'm sure he can help you
remove that alien beacon.

38:30.607 --> 38:31.642
Thanks.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.036
So, did you ever make it
to Trelkis Three?

38:39.647 --> 38:40.636
What?

38:40.807 --> 38:44.163
Trelkis Three, the planet
with the multi-centric rings.

38:45.207 --> 38:47.846
You used to talk about it
when we were growing up.

38:47.967 --> 38:50.083
We haven't travelled quite that far.

38:50.567 --> 38:51.716
When you do...

38:52.527 --> 38:54.882
how about sending me
a subspace postcard?

38:56.087 --> 38:57.520
You can count on it.

39:05.807 --> 39:07.684
I'd better get back to the Bridge.

39:12.847 --> 39:14.565
See you in another four years?

39:15.607 --> 39:16.756
Maybe sooner.

39:18.527 --> 39:19.676
I'd like that.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.124
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, sir.

39:44.567 --> 39:46.637
- How's your family?
- They're okay.

39:47.887 --> 39:51.197
We spotted some damage
on their port cargo modules.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.243
Probably an old meteorite impact.

39:58.087 --> 39:59.884
You sure everything's all right?

40:02.647 --> 40:04.000
Never better, sir.
