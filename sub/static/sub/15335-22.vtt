AND I CAN KEEP MY TONSILS.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.426
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR BACK?

09:53.460 --> 09:56.163
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY BACK.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.502
COME HERE, BABY.

10:05.673 --> 10:09.943
THESE ARE
SPECIALLY TRAINED HANDS.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.144
HOW HIGH, AND WHEN?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.747
AS HIGH AS YOU WANT,
AND NOW.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.516
HOW HIGH WILL YOU
BE JUMPING? AND WHEN?

10:16.549 --> 10:20.854
YOU ALWAYS DO YOUR OWN WASH
RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO A JUMP,

10:20.888 --> 10:24.124
AND IT'S THE ONLY TIME
YOU RUB MY BACK.

10:24.157 --> 10:24.992
HOW HIGH?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.427
THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.029
MUST BE
AT LEAST 30,000 FEET

10:29.062 --> 10:32.833
IF YOU'RE PACKING
YOUR WOOLIES.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.134
WERE YOU ASSIGNED?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.036
OR DID YOU VOLUNTEER?

10:39.006 --> 10:44.011
THE YOUNG PARATROOPER
WHO DIED TODAY, DADEZ,

10:44.044 --> 10:45.946
HE DIED
TRAINING FOR A JUMP.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.181
NOW, WHO TOLD YOU
SUCH A THING?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.149
AN EMBOLISM

10:49.182 --> 10:52.652
FROM LACK OF OXYGEN,
AND IT STOPPED HIS HEART.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.689
AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.790
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR BACK?

10:56.824 --> 10:58.125
DR. FARRIS IS JUST
GOING TO LET YOU JUMP

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
AND THAT'S
THE ARMY WAY, ISN'T IT?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.129
THEY'LL LIE TO KEEP YOU.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.296
NOBODY LIED.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.197
YOU HAVE SHRAPNEL

11:04.231 --> 11:08.535
SO CLOSE TO YOUR SPINE
THEY CAN'T OPERATE.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.039
IT'S MY DUTY.
IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

11:12.072 --> 11:16.009
BUT WILL YOU BE HERE
FOR YOUR GRANDCHILD SOMEDAY?

11:16.276 --> 11:19.512
AND WHAT, EXACTLY,
IS THE TIMETABLE

11:19.546 --> 11:22.415
FOR YOUR INEVITABLE EXIT?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.818
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.719
FOR YOUR PROPOSED

11:25.753 --> 11:29.089
INTACT RETIREMENT?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.393
MISSION FIRST.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.031
THEN TIMETABLE.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.177
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
UH, YEAH, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO WORRY YOU.

11:52.079 --> 11:56.549
WELL, NO, YOUR MESSAGE
WAS MYSTERIOUS.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.185
THE BRACELET.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.252
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.621
DID I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT?

12:01.654 --> 12:03.390
ACCEPTING MY BRACELET.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.860
NO, I DIDN'T
CHANGE MY MIND.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.861
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.363
YOU DIDN'T
TAKE THE BRACELET?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.300
BECAUSE WHEN
I GOT IN THIS MORNING,

12:13.333 --> 12:14.701
IT WAS GONE.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.569
WHEN WOULD--
WHEN COULD I HAVE DONE THAT?

12:16.603 --> 12:18.638
I CAN'T ACCEPT
A GIFT LIKE THAT FROM YOU.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.041
THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT BACK.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.744
IF IT WASN'T YOU...

12:24.778 --> 12:26.814
[SIGHS]

12:26.847 --> 12:30.417
WHEN YOU PUT IT
IN THE DRAWER,
WE WEREN'T ALONE.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.052
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.053
OH, COME ON.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.454
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.622
CHRISTINE, LOOK,

12:35.655 --> 12:37.224
YOU'VE BEEN
A GREAT CLERK, BUT--

12:37.257 --> 12:38.992
WILSON, I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.593
SHE'S LYING
THROUGH HER TEETH.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.162
YOU TOOK THE BRACELET.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.130
I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.799
I WAS HAPPY
TO BE OF SERVICE.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.499
HOW, EXACTLY?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.935
YOU LEFT
A FEW THINGS BEHIND,

12:47.968 --> 12:48.735
I PUT THEM ALL IN A BOX

12:48.768 --> 12:51.271
AND DROPPED THEM
AT YOUR HOME.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.974
YOU WERE IN MY HOME?

12:54.007 --> 12:58.278
YOUR HUSBAND SAID YOU WERE
AT A LAW FIRM DINNER.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.949
DID HE SEE THE BRACELET
FROM WILSON?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.783
I DON'T KNOW.
CHRISTINE.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.987
YOU WANTED HER
TO HAVE IT, DIDN'T YOU?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.189
NOTHING IS GOING ON
BETWEEN TIFFY AND ME.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.690
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.092
OF COURSE,
WHY WOULD YOU LIE?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.862
YOU SMUG BITCH.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.764
I NEED YOU TO PICK UP
ALL OF YOUR BELONGINGS

13:17.797 --> 13:19.933
AND LEAVE THIS OFFICE
RIGHT NOW.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.101
BECAUSE?
RIGHT NOW.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.937
WAIT A SECOND,
YOU WOULD KICK ME OUT
AND KEEP HER?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.172
AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE?

13:25.205 --> 13:28.141
YOU'VE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

13:32.145 --> 13:36.116
Mack, on radio: BETTY BLUE,
IS THE MALFUNCTION FIXED?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.951
IT'S NOT A MALFUNCTION.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.352
I FOUND A CUT WIRE.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.121
SOMEONE WANTED PRIVACY.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.956
CAN YOU
REWIRE THE SYSTEM?

13:42.990 --> 13:45.959
I CAN ADD
PICTURE-IN-PICTURE,
SURROUND SOUND,

13:45.993 --> 13:48.061
AND A LOVELY WALNUT CABINET.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.898
A SIMPLE "ROGER"
WILL SUFFICE.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.748
MY, MY, MY.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.084
YOU THINK
HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE BODYGUARD

14:11.118 --> 14:14.054
IS MOTIVE
FOR KILLING HER HUSBAND?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.056
HOW VIRTUOUS
ARE THE WORKS OF MAN...

14:16.089 --> 14:18.926
BUT THE THREATS
WERE CLEARLY
FROM THAI EXTREMISTS.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.928
OR SO IT APPEARS.

14:20.961 --> 14:21.995
SAY ON.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.330
A SCHEMING WIFE
WOULD MAKE IT APPEAR

14:23.363 --> 14:25.432
THAT THEY WERE
FROM HER HUSBAND'S ENEMIES.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.500
AND WHAT WOULD SHE GAIN
BY KILLING THE PRINCE,

14:27.534 --> 14:29.036
EXCEPT FOR
A LOSS OF STATUS?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.504
HER LIFE IF HE KNEW
ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.273
I DON'T KNOW.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.241
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.375
IF SHE WANTED
TO KILL HIM,

14:35.408 --> 14:38.245
ALL SHE NEEDS
IS A LAZY AFTERNOON
AND A MEAT CLEAVER.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.779
GOOD POINT,
MAKE SURE THAT
THE PRINCESS

14:39.812 --> 14:42.515
ISN'T ALONE
WITH HER HUSBAND
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.250
HOW?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.184
BY KEEPING EYES
ON BOTH OF THEM

14:44.217 --> 14:46.353
AT ALL TIMES,
INTERVENE IF NECESSARY.

STANDARD PART
OF THE DETAIL.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.356
KEEP 'EM BRIGHT-EYED
AND BUSHY-TAILED.

IS SIGNED.

ARE THESE YAHOOS?

15:24.992 --> 15:26.593

WE HAVE TO EVACUATE

15:26.626 --> 15:28.161

NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.063
[SPEAKING THAI]

15:30.097 --> 15:31.164

15:31.198 --> 15:33.100
THEY'RE ALL OUR FRIENDS.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.801
YES, MA'AM.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.936
WHERE'S MY BODYGUARD?

15:36.970 --> 15:40.307
HE'S BEEN RELIEVED
OF HIS DUTIES.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.843
THEY'RE
SENDING AWAY OUR STAFF.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.446
WE NEED TO REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF BODIES
IN THE COMPOUND.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.282
DO YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT, SIR?

15:49.316 --> 15:53.020
DEAR, THESE MEN ARE
JUST DOING THEIR JOBS.

16:04.998 --> 16:05.999
CAN'T RISK IT, JONAS.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.767
NOT BASED ON
THIS MEDICAL REPORT.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.869
A PIECE OF PAPER DOESN'T
GET THE MISSION DONE, SIR.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.938
HALF YOUR OPERATORS
CAN'T PASS THAT PHYSICAL.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.973
LET'S LET THE AIR FORCE
RUN WITH THIS ONE.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.110
THERE ARE ONLY 3 GUYS
THAT KNOW THE DETAILS
OF THIS OPERATION.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.645
AND ONE OF THEM
IS NOW DEAD.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.448
NO, YOU'RE NOT JUMPING.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.184
SIR, YOU DON'T SEND ME
ON THIS MISSION, I WALK.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.754
FROM THE WHOLE
FARMER'S MARKET.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.790
WE CROSS-DECK THIS
TO THE AIR FORCE,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.359
AND THEY DROP
THEIR LOVELY 5-TON BOMB,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.895
AND THEY MISS BECAUSE
WE GOT NOBODY ON THE GROUND.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.165
OR WORSE THEY MISS,

16:38.198 --> 16:41.034
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
TOMORROW'S HEADLINE IS?

16:41.068 --> 16:42.535
THAT'S RIGHT,

16:42.569 --> 16:46.706
100 WOMEN
AND CHILDREN ALL DEAD,
AND IT COMES BACK ON US.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.375
THE MISSION IS ON,
AND I'M GOING.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.911
OR YOU'RE PUTTING
ADS IN THE PERSONALS
SEEKING A TEAM LEADER.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.214
AND REMIND ME AGAIN,
THOSE GROW ON TREES?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.883
AND WHAT IF YOU BURN IN
AT 70 MILES AN HOUR?

16:56.916 --> 16:58.585
I WON'T BURN IN.
AND WHAT IF YOU DO?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.353
THEN DON'T LET MY WIFE
MARRY A LAWYER.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.690
I'M SAYING THIS
AS A FRIEND, JONAS.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.126
I GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.332
WHAT ARE
THE ONLY THINGS THAT FALL
FROM THE SKY, JONAS?

17:12.365 --> 17:17.137

AND THE AIRBORNE RANGERS.

SHOULD GUARD THESE.

17:38.658 --> 17:42.262
THAT HIS SON
NOT DRIVE THIS CAR.

TOO LITERALLY SOMETIMES.

ME DRIVING TOO FAST.

A GORGEOUS FRIEND, TOO.

TO GET OUT TONIGHT.

ON HER HUSBAND MIGHT BE

HIM IN THE HEAD.
