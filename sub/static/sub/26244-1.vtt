he has to see to it that he does.

And besides, if you weren't so sniffy
about who sees you and who doesn't,

then maybe my granddad would've chosen
somewhere a bit less populated.

The important thing is that all the forms
have now been filed, so...

16:04.254 --> 16:08.133
We've had enough
of her ruthless occupation

16:08.217 --> 16:10.886
of our historic city,
haven't we, Angelina?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.096
Ooh, yes, we have.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.014
We have, haven't we?
Meow!

16:14.098 --> 16:16.266
But there's nothing ruthless about it.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.811
We didn't know
you even existed until recently.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.147
-Pure ignorance!
-You're invisible!

16:22.356 --> 16:24.191
-[meowing]
-Please, please,

16:24.274 --> 16:26.860
can you lower your voice?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.154
You're alarming my cat.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.574
Well, look, I'm sorry about that,
but, please, don't evict us.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.618
Can't we just get along?

16:34.702 --> 16:38.080
[gasps] Angelina's heavily pregnant.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.958
I don't want her unnecessarily stressed.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.545
She's a purebred velourian silkhair.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.340
-Fetch Angelina's basket, will you?
-Right away, Mr. Mayor.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.843
Oh. Do you need to lie down?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.595
Yes. You look the way I feel.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.472
You're not answering my questions.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.767
Oh, are you still here?
Look, well, wheels are in motion,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.686
plans are in place,
letters are being sent,

17:00.769 --> 17:03.522
and forms are being filled in,
lots of forms!

17:03.605 --> 17:05.941
But surely you can stop it.
You're the mayor.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.360
Impossible! I'm only the mayor!

17:08.444 --> 17:09.903
It's out of my hands.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.656
And I don't even have hands!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.366
So whose hands is it in?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.828
Oh, I imagine the only person
who could do anything about it

17:17.911 --> 17:19.371
is the new prime minister.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.582
It's his big idea, after all.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.793
-Where can I find him?
-I can't tell you that!

17:24.877 --> 17:28.422
-It's classified information.
-Tell me, please.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.175
-No, I--
-[meowing]

17:31.258 --> 17:33.802
-[gasps] Oh, Angelina!
-Aha!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.763
Oh! You beast!

17:36.305 --> 17:37.890
Release her this instant!

17:37.973 --> 17:39.516
Tell me where the prime minister is,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.602
or I'll let your kitty live
in my hair forever.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.730
Ah, you fiend! You monster!
You beast! Oh.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.358
Behind the waterfall, the great big one
that goes into the fjord.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.860
I know where that is.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.321
-Oh, thank goodness!
-The basket, sir.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.281
Oh, there, Angelina. There.
Are you all right?

17:54.364 --> 17:57.409
I'm going straight
to the prime minister this instant.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.995
Hilda, wait! [grunts]

18:00.079 --> 18:03.373
I'm telling you that barging in like this
could be dangerous!

18:04.124 --> 18:07.961
I've got to fix this right now, Alfur,
and I don't need a formal introduction.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.822
[panting]

18:37.533 --> 18:38.534
[gasps]

18:39.910 --> 18:41.787
There it is! Let's go-- [grunts]

18:41.870 --> 18:43.872
Oof! [exhales]

18:43.956 --> 18:45.666
Aw! A rabbit.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.001
Looks like you took a tumble,
poor little thing.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.254
-[squeaking]
-Ah! It's not just a rabbit!

18:50.337 --> 18:53.257
-What?
-It's the prime minister's cavalry.

18:53.841 --> 18:57.427
Implement giant girl defense maneuvers!

18:57.511 --> 18:59.346
Charge!

18:59.429 --> 19:01.140
[screaming]

19:02.516 --> 19:03.559
[Alfur screams]

19:03.642 --> 19:05.936
[elf commander] Charge forth!

19:06.019 --> 19:07.855
Yah!

19:07.938 --> 19:08.856
Help!

19:08.939 --> 19:10.190
[yells]

19:12.651 --> 19:14.027
[snarling]

19:15.612 --> 19:16.864
[thuds, squeaks]

19:16.947 --> 19:20.117
Implement hasty retreat maneuver!

19:20.951 --> 19:23.245
Run away! Run away!
Faster! Faster!

19:23.328 --> 19:25.122
Oh, she's gaining on us! Ah!

19:25.622 --> 19:28.125
[sighs] Thanks for that, boy.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.211
[Alfur] It's nice to have a deer fox
on your side, I must say.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.053
Ah! And here we are.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.139
[drum roll]

19:42.222 --> 19:44.558
Our training is complete.

19:44.641 --> 19:48.979
We're ready to launch
our next attack this evening, sir!

19:49.062 --> 19:51.982
-[Hilda] Hold on a second!
-[elves screaming]

19:53.942 --> 19:57.070
Please, I mean you no harm!
I just want to explain myself.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.113
[screaming stops]

19:58.572 --> 20:01.742
Oh, well, in that case,
everybody be seated.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.620
I want to find a way
we can all live together in peace.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.623
I love my home,
and I don't want to leave it.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.834
Well, that's, uh, interesting.
Look, I'll be honest with you.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.838
I only said I'd get rid of you
because I knew I'd get elected if I did.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.506
It's nothing personal.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.092
-Hip, hip!
-Hear, hear!

20:19.176 --> 20:21.762
Do you really all hate
my mum and me that much?

20:21.845 --> 20:23.388
-[elf 1] Yes!
-[elf 2] Indeed!

20:23.472 --> 20:26.183
You must understand
that the lights from your house

20:26.266 --> 20:27.601
are much too bright at night.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.229
For the record,
I don't hate you even a little bit.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.106
Annoyance, sometimes, yes,
but never, never hatred.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.151
You're very loud.
You keep babies up!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.403
And you're always stepping on us.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.115
But I know stepping on you doesn't
hurt you if you haven't signed the forms.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.076
I saw Twig's leg go right through a house.

20:44.159 --> 20:48.330
Still, it's a traumatic experience having
a giant foot come through your ceilings.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.582
-[chuckles]
-Okay, I get it, I do.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.878
Listen, we can turn off our lights earlier
and keep our voices down.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.423
And if we get my mum to sign the forms,
then everything should be fine, right?

20:58.507 --> 21:01.843
-It's not quite as simple as that.
-It's not?

21:02.427 --> 21:07.641
Your house, you and your family,
since anyone can remember,

21:07.724 --> 21:10.686
have been considered
sworn enemies of the king.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.438
Yes! Yes! Sworn enemies of the king!

21:13.522 --> 21:17.859
No one's ever bothered to try
and do anything about it until me!

21:17.943 --> 21:22.155
And I'm afraid to say that fixing
the situation at this point is, um...

21:22.239 --> 21:24.658
-[Hilda] Out of your hands?
-Yes.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.536
And I don't even have hands!
[chuckles]

21:31.164 --> 21:32.666
Hilda, wait!

21:43.218 --> 21:45.804
[sniffling, crying]

21:47.973 --> 21:50.434
[panting]

21:51.852 --> 21:53.478
-[sniffles]
-Hoo!

21:53.562 --> 21:57.607
Alfur, if I was to ask you to tell me
where the king lives, would you tell me?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.776
Or is it out of the question?

22:00.360 --> 22:03.363
[sighs] That would violate every protocol.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.074
[sniffles] I understand.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.661
Mm...

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
Mm...

22:12.914 --> 22:14.708
Yes, I'll take you.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.044
You will?

22:17.127 --> 22:19.546
I will, but it's a tough journey.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.131
I'll need time to prepare.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.633
We can leave
the day after tomorrow at sunrise.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.012
-Thank you, Alfur.
-Not at all.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.223
It's actually closer to home
than you might think.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.687
[theme music playing]
