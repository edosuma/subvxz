<i>By the fall of 2011,</i>

00:03.472 --> 00:06.640
<i>a lot of the intrigue</i>
<i>out of life.</i>

00:07.705 --> 00:11.024
<i>The Internet had everyone's</i>

00:12.392 --> 00:15.611
<i>Nothing was a mystery anymore.</i>

00:18.064 --> 00:20.008
<i>But, kids, there was</i>
<i>a time before that,</i>

00:20.009 --> 00:22.476
<i>way back in the dark ages.</i>

00:22.478 --> 00:23.877
Are you people insane?!

00:23.879 --> 00:26.364
The most popular food in America
is the cheeseburger!

00:26.366 --> 00:27.848
No way! It's pizza!

00:27.850 --> 00:31.068
Are we forgetting about
a certain Mr. Furter,

00:31.070 --> 00:32.653
first name Frank?

00:32.655 --> 00:35.055
Um, what did every kid
bring in their lunchbox

00:35.057 --> 00:37.224
every day till
grade eight?

00:37.226 --> 00:38.892
Pancakes with
maple syrup.

00:39.695 --> 00:41.162
Thanks, Canada.

00:41.164 --> 00:43.914
We're looking for a food
the average <i>American</i> eats.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.399
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh!

00:45.401 --> 00:46.701
Chinese food.

00:46.703 --> 00:49.170
<i>And then came the smartphone.</i>

00:51.072 --> 00:52.340
Hey, remember

00:52.342 --> 00:55.760
when we were arguing about
the most popular food?

00:56.795 --> 00:58.045
It's bread.

00:58.047 --> 00:59.797
Hm.

00:59.799 --> 01:02.183
<i>And the barroom debate</i>
<i>was dead.</i>

01:02.185 --> 01:04.251
<i>You guys are idiots!</i>

01:04.253 --> 01:07.054
<i>Okay, not completely dead.</i>
You are seriously telling me

01:07.056 --> 01:08.556
you don't want
to open that envelope

01:08.558 --> 01:10.758
and find out if you're
having a boy or a girl?

01:10.760 --> 01:14.445
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us
this in case we wanted to know.

01:14.447 --> 01:16.147
But we don't.

01:16.149 --> 01:18.816
Lilypad and I are just gonna
wait till that baby pops out

01:18.818 --> 01:20.201
and enjoy the big surprise.

01:20.203 --> 01:22.903
Look, I have pretended
to be a licensed therapist

01:22.905 --> 01:25.072
enough times to know
there is something unhealthy

01:25.074 --> 01:26.907
about your not wanting
to find out.

01:26.909 --> 01:29.160
- Back me up here, Kev.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:29.162 --> 01:32.496
This real therapist
won't risk upsetting

01:32.498 --> 01:36.217
his wonderful new girlfriend by
analyzing her wonderful friends.

01:37.219 --> 01:40.054
No matter how mentally
unbalanced they may be.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.172
I hear you.

01:41.174 --> 01:42.790
I don't think you do.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.726
We just don't want to
burden our little angel

01:45.728 --> 01:49.063
with all kinds of 
gender-specific expectations.

01:49.065 --> 01:51.766
Boys can do ballet;
girls can play football.

01:51.768 --> 01:53.576
Hell, the Green Bay
Packers have been

01:53.601 --> 01:54.801
proving that for years.

01:57.689 --> 02:00.491
That would've gotten
a big laugh at a sports bar.

02:00.493 --> 02:02.493
Well, I say define
gender roles early.

02:02.495 --> 02:04.745
All the other girls
got a pretty dress

02:04.747 --> 02:07.365
and a cake when
they turned 14.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.666
Me...

02:08.668 --> 02:10.918
I want to go home, Daddy!

02:10.919 --> 02:14.755
That direction is
nothing but wolves.

02:16.007 --> 02:20.511
And 40 kilometers that way
is the mining town of Smithers.

02:20.513 --> 02:23.330
I'd take my chances
with the wolves.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.552
I'll see you in three days.

02:28.554 --> 02:31.305
Well, wait, wh-what
am I supposed to eat?

02:31.307 --> 02:34.358
Hey, you've got a knife,
the forest is full of animals--

02:34.360 --> 02:36.143
what do you want, a buffet?

02:36.145 --> 02:38.062
Papa...!

02:38.064 --> 02:41.232
Happy birthday, son...!

02:42.651 --> 02:45.069
Got any thoughts
on that, Doc?

02:45.071 --> 02:47.938
If you guys think I'm going near
that, <i>you're</i> crazy.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.907
Why'd you
emphasize "you're"?

02:49.909 --> 02:52.184
No reason.
You're pretty.

By the way, do you guys want
to come over tomorrow night

03:07.097 --> 03:08.297
for sangria and tapas?

03:08.478 --> 03:10.311
<i>Si. Muchas gracias.</i>
That sounds awesome.

03:10.313 --> 03:11.929
Great. We're also
gonna paint the nursery.

03:11.931 --> 03:14.815
Oh, and a quick update
on the sangria and tapas--

03:14.817 --> 03:16.484
that's cancelled.
Mmm...

03:16.486 --> 03:17.518
Guess what smooth
son of a bitch

03:17.520 --> 03:20.220
just picked up
a girl at the bar?

03:20.222 --> 03:22.156
Barney, you're cheating
on Nora already?

03:22.158 --> 03:23.591
No, guys, it's <i>me.</i>

03:23.593 --> 03:25.392
Janet McIntyre.

03:25.394 --> 03:26.577
Struck up a conversation
at the bar

03:26.579 --> 03:28.662
while ordering, she guessed
bread right away,

03:28.664 --> 03:31.056
we laughed, it was
a thing, boom, going

03:31.057 --> 03:32.230
out tomorrow night.

03:32.235 --> 03:35.669
- So, she said yes just like that?
- Just like that.

03:35.671 --> 03:36.859
There's
something wrong with her.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.084
No, no, no, no.

03:38.324 --> 03:39.406
Stop it. They
always do this.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.625
Every time I go
on a first date,

03:41.627 --> 03:43.961
they snap right into
research mode.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.429
<i>It started by accident.</i>

03:45.431 --> 03:47.882
Ooh.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.100
Hello?

03:50.102 --> 03:52.303
Ted, we did a little
Internet research

03:52.305 --> 03:53.604
on your Mia Plumley.

03:53.606 --> 03:54.822
We just sent you

03:54.824 --> 03:56.223
a picture of her
from six months ago.

03:56.225 --> 03:58.209
I don't understand--
is Mia standing behind

03:58.211 --> 04:01.612
this morbidly obese wo...
Oh, my God!

04:01.614 --> 04:04.097
They had cookies and cream.

04:04.099 --> 04:06.283
And what you were saying
about how women feel

04:06.285 --> 04:08.769
they have to starve themselves
makes so much sense.

04:09.287 --> 04:12.122
Ooh, hot dogs. Score!

04:12.124 --> 04:14.325
<i>After that, background checks</i>

04:14.327 --> 04:17.244
<i>became standard</i>
<i>operating procedure.</i>

04:17.245 --> 04:19.329
The date with Nadine went great.

04:19.332 --> 04:21.214
Unless you guys found something.

04:21.216 --> 04:22.800
Are you sitting down?

04:22.802 --> 04:24.785
No.

04:26.505 --> 04:30.591
She's wanted in Florida
on crystal meth charges.

04:30.593 --> 04:33.511
She breeds pit bulls
for dog fighting.

04:33.513 --> 04:35.346
- Also, the FBI...
- What's this link?

04:35.348 --> 04:37.398
Oh, she also writes
online movie reviews.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.467
Anyway, she's still married to
a death row inmate convicted...

04:40.469 --> 04:43.470
She gave <i>Annie Hall</i>
two out of ten stars?

04:43.472 --> 04:45.773
"Slow and overrated"?

04:45.775 --> 04:48.325
Really? <i>That's</i>
your takeaway?

04:48.327 --> 04:50.494
It's the Wood Man at
the height of his powers.

04:50.496 --> 04:53.447
The way he broke the fourth wall
by talking directly to camera?

04:53.449 --> 04:55.332
People have been
ripping that off ever since.

04:55.334 --> 04:58.953
Can you believe this guy?

04:58.955 --> 05:00.421
Paula Vincenzo.

05:00.423 --> 05:01.872
She's in the bathroom.

05:01.874 --> 05:02.823
What's wrong with her?

05:02.825 --> 05:04.792
Total psycho.
Her Facebook wall

05:04.794 --> 05:07.995
has a link to a site about
dating inanimate objects.

05:07.997 --> 05:09.997
For most of last year,
she was engaged...

05:09.999 --> 05:12.349
to a mini fridge.
And there's pictures:

05:12.351 --> 05:14.385
her and the mini
fridge on a hike,

05:14.387 --> 05:16.437
her and the mini fridge
in wine country,

05:16.439 --> 05:18.222
here's the mini fridge
meeting her parents...

05:18.224 --> 05:19.974
Run like the wind.

05:22.228 --> 05:25.563
So... want to go
back to my place?

05:25.565 --> 05:27.615
Yeah, all right.

05:29.517 --> 05:31.297
Well, thanks to us,
you ran screaming from

05:31.322 --> 05:32.522
that freak show, right?

05:32.622 --> 05:34.872
- Absolutely.
- Cuckoo!

05:36.408 --> 05:38.075
So what's the problem?

05:38.077 --> 05:39.126
You need us.

05:39.128 --> 05:40.360
No, I don't, okay?

05:40.362 --> 05:41.845
I don't want a
background check.

05:41.847 --> 05:43.914
I want adventure
and excitement.

05:43.916 --> 05:45.332
Look, if it's
a choice

05:45.334 --> 05:47.184
between mystery
and history,

05:47.186 --> 05:49.219
I want mystery.

05:49.221 --> 05:50.621
In fact...

05:50.623 --> 05:52.222
Ted, I wouldn't...

05:52.224 --> 05:54.391
Uh, Janet.

05:54.393 --> 05:56.594
I have a theory.
People don't get the chance

05:56.596 --> 05:58.862
to just discover
each other anymore, so...

05:58.864 --> 05:59.897
here's my idea.

05:59.899 --> 06:01.315
Before we go out tomorrow,

06:01.317 --> 06:04.068
let's not do any prior
Internet research on each other.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.637
It sounds like I'm hiding something
horrible, doesn't it?

06:06.639 --> 06:08.105
I'm pretty sure
you're a serial killer.

06:08.107 --> 06:09.389
I'm not. I'm not.

06:09.391 --> 06:11.408
It's just, you know, like,
when my parents met,

06:11.410 --> 06:13.393
they didn't have the Internet--
they just went out

06:13.395 --> 06:15.279
on a blind date
and fell in love.

06:15.281 --> 06:17.164
That's nice.
And they're still together?

06:17.166 --> 06:18.248
Right up to the divorce.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.335
The point is, I'd love
to get to know you

06:21.337 --> 06:23.637
in person, not on my computer.

06:23.639 --> 06:25.589
I like that.
What started out

06:25.591 --> 06:28.008
sounding really creepy
turned out really sweet.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.178
That's kind of my move.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.630
And she was

06:32.632 --> 06:34.832
on board with the whole
"no Internet" thing?

06:34.834 --> 06:36.800
She loved it.

06:37.752 --> 06:38.936
The bitch is
hiding something.

06:38.938 --> 06:40.804
The bitch is totally
hiding something.

06:44.998 --> 06:46.449
Hey, Ted, before you leave--

06:46.451 --> 06:49.268
is Janet McIntyre
M-A-C or M-C?

06:49.270 --> 06:51.304
For the last time,
I don't want to know

06:51.306 --> 06:52.905
anything about her
before the date.

06:52.907 --> 06:55.825
You might want to see this,
Ted-- naked pictures.

06:55.827 --> 06:57.660
That's not Janet.

06:57.662 --> 06:59.445
Who, now?

06:59.447 --> 07:01.214
Seriously...

07:01.216 --> 07:04.333
if you guys respect
me as a friend...

07:04.335 --> 07:05.885
stop looking.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.725
Well, Ted was pretty
clear there, so...

07:12.727 --> 07:13.959
let's shut those laptops

07:13.961 --> 07:16.462
and go help Lily and Marshall,
just like we promised.

07:16.464 --> 07:17.930
Let's leave

07:17.932 --> 07:21.484
the laptops here
and go paint that baby room.

07:22.853 --> 07:24.837
Without laptops.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.489
Or bring the laptops.
Either way.

07:26.491 --> 07:28.974
This is exciting.

07:28.976 --> 07:30.476
I give you...

07:30.478 --> 07:33.329
the color our child
will grow up with.

07:33.331 --> 07:36.582
Yellow, like the sun.

07:36.584 --> 07:39.318
Or daughter.
Pun snuggle.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.206
Oh, God, this room's about
to get its first spit-up.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.341
Just open the envelope already!

07:45.343 --> 07:47.593
Kevin, will you please
tell Barney that it is

07:47.595 --> 07:50.429
perfectly normal for us to want
to preserve the mystery.

07:50.431 --> 07:52.932
I'm not here to analyze; I'm
here to win boyfriend points.

07:52.934 --> 07:55.885
By the way, you all
look great, especially Robin.

07:55.887 --> 07:58.020
Come on, if you don't
know the gender,

07:58.022 --> 08:00.556
you're gonna get generic crap
at the baby shower.

08:00.558 --> 08:02.441
But if you do know the gender,

08:02.443 --> 08:05.311
you'll get, oh,
I don't know, this!

08:05.313 --> 08:06.863
Marshall! Lights!

08:07.698 --> 08:09.699
Okay.

08:11.369 --> 08:14.303
When little Jack's
not turning double plays,

08:14.305 --> 08:16.088
he's turning heads with this

08:16.090 --> 08:18.140
home run of an outfit!

08:18.142 --> 08:20.159
And if it's a little girl...

08:20.161 --> 08:23.696
This royal ensemble
may leave <i>you</i> speechless,

08:23.698 --> 08:25.331
but it's sure to make
little Sally say,

08:25.333 --> 08:28.551
"I wuv you, Mommy,
and I wuv my dress,

08:28.553 --> 08:32.205
and I would love
to see you in the shower."

08:32.207 --> 08:34.557
Sorry, I kind of fell out of
character in that last part.

08:34.558 --> 08:37.577
But if you don't
know the gender...

08:37.578 --> 08:41.097
Little Fran is sure to be
the pariah of the playground

08:41.099 --> 08:44.367
in this hermaphroditic
burlap sack.

08:54.028 --> 08:54.777
No. You just

08:54.779 --> 08:55.761
can't stand

08:55.763 --> 08:57.330
not knowing something.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.282
That's ridiculous!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Marshall, will you...

09:01.002 --> 09:02.518
will you hold
these for a second?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.619
Yeah, sure. Why?

09:03.621 --> 09:05.454
Because I gots to know!

09:05.456 --> 09:07.506
Oh, Barney, no!
Help! Get him off of me!

09:07.508 --> 09:10.126
Everybody hold it!
Hold it!

09:10.128 --> 09:13.212
I found Janet McIntyre,
who's been widowed three times.

09:13.214 --> 09:15.298
She's obviously
killing her husbands!

09:15.300 --> 09:17.934
Oh, my God!

09:17.936 --> 09:19.552
They're six minutes
into the date.

09:19.554 --> 09:21.887
Ted's probably already told her
that he loves her!

09:21.889 --> 09:23.439
We've got to get down there!

09:25.426 --> 09:27.226
Nobody's going anywhere!

09:27.228 --> 09:28.260
Why?!

09:28.262 --> 09:29.779
<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

09:29.781 --> 09:31.764
<i>Kevin thought back</i>
<i>to his earlier rule...</i>

09:31.766 --> 09:34.116
This real therapist
won't risk

09:34.118 --> 09:36.268
upsetting his wonderful
new girlfriend

09:36.270 --> 09:38.437
by analyzing her
wonderful friends.

09:38.439 --> 09:40.139
<i>...and threw it out the window.</i>

09:40.141 --> 09:42.375
You're all the most
codependent, incestuous,

09:42.377 --> 09:44.710
controlling group of
people I've ever met!

09:46.446 --> 09:49.498
By the way, you all look
great, especially Robin.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.617
Oh, mm-mm.

09:53.470 --> 09:56.255
This is so great.

09:56.257 --> 09:58.123
Right? See, if we'd
researched each other,

09:58.125 --> 10:00.226
we'd both be secretly
steering the conversation

10:00.228 --> 10:01.560
one way or the other.

10:01.562 --> 10:02.979
But this is
more exciting, right?

10:02.981 --> 10:04.096
Way more exciting.

10:04.098 --> 10:06.148
I mean, we can talk
about anything we want.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.484
Anything.

10:11.272 --> 10:12.971
So...

10:13.790 --> 10:16.192
...how was the traffic
getting here?

10:16.194 --> 10:18.244
You picked me up
at my apartment.

10:19.112 --> 10:20.696
I certainly did.

10:21.531 --> 10:23.199
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

10:23.201 --> 10:25.984
<i>I've lost the ability to talk</i>
<i>to girls without the Internet.</i>

10:25.986 --> 10:28.421
<i>My brain is</i>
<i>completely shutting down.</i>

10:28.423 --> 10:30.989
So, are you folks gonna have
dinner or just drinks?

10:32.293 --> 10:33.992
I-I don't know.

10:34.795 --> 10:37.296
What the hell
was that, Kevin?

10:37.298 --> 10:38.514
We're all crazy just because

10:38.516 --> 10:40.016
I'm looking up some stuff
on the Internet,

10:40.018 --> 10:42.000
and Barney wants
to know the baby's gender?

10:42.002 --> 10:44.603
Well, to be honest,

10:44.605 --> 10:46.772
I noticed some
other disturbing...

10:47.724 --> 10:49.508
Never mind.

10:49.510 --> 10:50.893
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

10:50.895 --> 10:52.528
I gots to know!

10:52.530 --> 10:54.864
Okay, last night alone...

10:54.866 --> 10:57.283
When-When are you coming back?

10:57.285 --> 10:59.702
Because I miss you, silly!

11:02.289 --> 11:03.456
Wait, who's he talking to?

11:03.458 --> 11:05.624
Shh, I'll be back soon.

11:05.626 --> 11:07.526
Yeah, you want me
to bring you a pretzel?

11:09.947 --> 11:12.298
Ted's texting me
from the bathroom.

11:13.418 --> 11:15.501
Oh.

11:15.503 --> 11:16.669
I don't get it.

11:16.671 --> 11:18.888
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.
- Oh.

11:18.890 --> 11:19.922
Oh, yeah.

11:19.924 --> 11:22.341
Sometimes when one
of us is on the can,

11:22.343 --> 11:24.894
we'll, uh, sneak a peek
and then text each other,

11:24.896 --> 11:26.896
you know.

11:26.898 --> 11:30.549
Symbols to describe what your
bowel movement looks like?

11:32.052 --> 11:35.938
This morning,
I took an ampersand.

11:35.940 --> 11:37.556
Last summer,
I dropped a deuce

11:37.558 --> 11:39.825
that actually looked
like the number two!

11:42.530 --> 11:45.664
When you worked
late Wednesday,

11:45.666 --> 11:49.835
I... I got
lonely and...

11:49.837 --> 11:53.071
I watched <i>Survivor</i>
without you.

11:55.076 --> 11:57.176
Practically the only unhealthy
behavior I didn't see

11:57.178 --> 11:59.795
from you people
was physical violence.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.387
Yeah.

12:08.389 --> 12:09.805
At least we don't do that.

12:10.941 --> 12:12.224
And to top it off,

12:12.226 --> 12:14.059
all the meddling
in Ted's love life,

12:14.061 --> 12:15.427
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?

12:15.429 --> 12:18.764
It all strikes me as
just deeply dysfunctional.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.951
So what you're saying is,
we're fine?

12:24.989 --> 12:27.656
So, while this font is often

12:27.658 --> 12:29.625
mistaken for Helvetica,

12:29.627 --> 12:33.078
the fact is...

12:33.080 --> 12:35.881
it's Helvetica Bold.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.617
<i>I can actually hear the sound</i>

12:38.619 --> 12:41.353
<i>of her vagina being boarded up.</i>

12:42.839 --> 12:44.557
I got to be honest, Janet.

12:44.559 --> 12:47.643
First of all...
this is Times New Roman.

12:48.512 --> 12:49.962
Second, I'm having trouble

12:49.964 --> 12:51.931
coming up with things
to talk about.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.799
You? I'm sitting here thinking,

12:53.801 --> 12:57.019
"Damn it, I wish I had something
as good as that font thing.

12:57.021 --> 12:58.487
That's gold."

12:58.489 --> 13:00.523
Guys, I'm so sorry
I said anything.

13:00.525 --> 13:04.109
Um, you basically called
my friends mentally ill.

13:04.111 --> 13:06.612
Yeah, you think some lame
apology will fix that?

13:06.614 --> 13:09.331
What if I just paint the rest
of the room by myself?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.750
Apology accepted.

13:11.752 --> 13:13.118
Okay, let's do this.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.753
Let-Let's find out
each other's likes and dislikes.

13:14.755 --> 13:15.955
Start with something
totally random.

13:15.957 --> 13:17.540
Like, um, oh, I don't know.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.325
Are you a fan of--
I don't know--

13:20.327 --> 13:22.344
<i>Annie Hall?</i>

13:22.346 --> 13:25.297
I'm guessing that's not random
at all, and you use that movie

13:25.299 --> 13:27.216
to test whether a girl is cool?

13:27.218 --> 13:28.934
No, it's-it's the first movie
that popped into...

13:28.936 --> 13:30.636
I love <i>Annie Hall.</i>
Oh, thank God you're cool.

13:30.638 --> 13:32.471
<i>But just as things started</i>

13:32.473 --> 13:34.523
<i>to go well</i>
<i>with Janet McIntyre...</i>

13:34.525 --> 13:36.809
Whoa. I just found
Janet McIntyre.

13:36.811 --> 13:39.028
<i>The</i> Janet McIntyre.

13:45.235 --> 13:49.071
Sweet... mother... of God!

13:55.212 --> 13:56.996
Uh, well, I got to
run to the restroom.

13:56.998 --> 13:59.081
No internet, Mister.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.866
If you find out my deep, dark
secret, I'll have to kill you.

14:00.868 --> 14:02.418
It's just my friends
checking up on me.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.420
I'll politely let them know
we're having a lovely time.

14:04.422 --> 14:05.871
Okay.

14:07.257 --> 14:09.758
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on
the link, so leave me alone."

14:09.760 --> 14:12.428
And then either texted me a
bunch of symbols for profanity,

14:12.430 --> 14:13.545
or got food poisoning

14:13.547 --> 14:15.547
and dropped the weirdest deuce
of all time.

14:15.549 --> 14:17.650
You guys have
to see this.

14:17.652 --> 14:19.485
No. We're with
Ted on this.

14:19.487 --> 14:21.386
We don't want to
find out about Janet,

14:21.388 --> 14:24.056
just like we don't want to
find out about the baby.

14:24.058 --> 14:25.407
Because we like mystery,

14:25.409 --> 14:27.493
whether it's the hairy
majesty of Bigfoot,

14:27.495 --> 14:30.529
or the bloodsucking ferocity
of the Chupacabra,

14:30.531 --> 14:32.364
or the gender
of our little miracle.

14:32.366 --> 14:33.699
Thanks for putting
those together

14:33.701 --> 14:35.067
in the same
sentence, sweetie.

14:35.069 --> 14:36.418
Mm.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.121
Look, if you guys don't want
to know, how about this?

14:39.123 --> 14:41.707
Let me look,
and I won't tell you.

14:41.709 --> 14:43.509
Absolutely not.
Fine.

14:44.345 --> 14:45.544
Baby, if it will shut him up,

14:45.546 --> 14:46.629
what's the harm?

14:48.581 --> 14:50.683
Can I...?

14:55.806 --> 14:57.806
This may have been a mistake.

14:57.808 --> 14:59.558
Boy!

14:59.560 --> 15:00.926
Do I like babies!

15:01.695 --> 15:02.478
Girl!

15:03.063 --> 15:04.113
...friend,

15:04.115 --> 15:05.931
your hair looks
fantastic!

15:06.366 --> 15:08.150
Twins!

15:08.152 --> 15:10.402
was the feel-good movie of 1988.

15:10.404 --> 15:13.038
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't
matter what you guys say.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.239
We're not gonna cave.

15:14.241 --> 15:15.574
Yes, we are!

15:15.576 --> 15:17.559
Oh, just open
your eyes.

15:17.561 --> 15:20.045
This gender-neutral
yellow is horrible!

15:20.047 --> 15:22.581
We're clearly gonna paint
over the whole thing!

15:22.583 --> 15:24.616
That's what you want to hear.

15:24.618 --> 15:26.051
I gots to know!

15:26.053 --> 15:27.720
Yeah.

15:27.722 --> 15:30.139
"It's a..."

15:30.141 --> 15:32.057
It's a...

15:32.059 --> 15:33.726
Where is the rest
of the card?

15:33.728 --> 15:35.477
I ripped it in half.

15:35.479 --> 15:37.462
I knew you'd be
desperate to see it,

15:37.464 --> 15:38.764
and I'll give it to you.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.934
All you have to do is admit
that mystery is stupid

15:41.936 --> 15:45.404
by reading
about Janet McIntyre.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.139
This is in no way
emotional extortion.

15:47.141 --> 15:48.524
You guys are great.

15:48.526 --> 15:50.659
Fine, we'll look
at your laptop.

15:51.995 --> 15:54.446
Sweet...

15:54.448 --> 15:57.082
mother... of God.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.336
I can't really see
the computer screen.

16:00.338 --> 16:02.371
It just went down
the wrong pipe.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.759
<i>Whoa.</i>

16:06.761 --> 16:09.044
<i>If Lily and Marshall want me</i>
<i>to click on it,</i>

16:09.046 --> 16:11.847
<i>maybe Janet really does have</i>
<i>a deep, dark secret.</i>

16:12.849 --> 16:14.266
What's going on?

16:14.268 --> 16:15.434
I'm a prostitute.

16:15.436 --> 16:16.352
You didn't think I was

16:16.354 --> 16:17.469
actually into you, did you?

16:17.471 --> 16:18.887
Sort of.

16:20.975 --> 16:23.175
<i>Get it together, Mosby.</i>

16:25.678 --> 16:27.079
Oh.

16:28.482 --> 16:30.348
You don't buy beer,
you rent it.

16:30.350 --> 16:31.784
Am I right?

16:31.786 --> 16:33.202
This is the
men's room.

16:33.204 --> 16:34.787
I know.

16:34.789 --> 16:35.754
I'm a dude.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:45.132 --> 16:48.133
Listen, there's something
you should know.

16:48.135 --> 16:50.386
I lied.

16:50.388 --> 16:52.221
I only kind of liked <i>Annie Hall.</i>

16:56.342 --> 16:59.261
<i>I gots to know!</i>

17:03.733 --> 17:05.717
Sweet...

17:05.719 --> 17:08.436
mother... of God.

17:19.544 --> 17:21.694
Hey.

17:24.922 --> 17:26.923
Ted, are you okay?
You look freaked out.

17:26.925 --> 17:29.559
I'm not freaked out.

17:29.561 --> 17:31.995
<i>I was freaked out. Why?</i>

17:31.997 --> 17:34.964
<i>'Cause I had just discovered</i>
<i>that Janet McIntyre was...</i>

17:34.966 --> 17:37.200
<i>amazing!</i>

17:58.372 --> 18:02.458
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>the wall went up.</i>

18:02.460 --> 18:04.460
Okay, he looked at
Janet McIntyre's

18:04.462 --> 18:06.329
Internet
extravaganza.

18:06.331 --> 18:08.348
Here's the other half
of the card.

18:14.138 --> 18:16.139
Wait. Should we
do this? I...

18:16.141 --> 18:18.474
I don't know.
I mean, my soul says no,

18:18.476 --> 18:21.027
but these hideous
yellow walls scream yes.

18:21.029 --> 18:23.813
Should I just stop, or...?

18:23.815 --> 18:26.316
Sweet mother of God!

18:26.318 --> 18:29.702
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way
to Saskatoon!

18:30.537 --> 18:31.854
What?

18:31.856 --> 18:33.122
We figured out the Janet thing.

18:33.124 --> 18:34.457
I'm catching up on Canada.

18:38.162 --> 18:39.862
You're with me on this, right?

18:39.864 --> 18:42.698
Otherwise, I can go down,
and I can get the card.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.466
Absolutely.

18:43.468 --> 18:45.418
Oh, thank you.

18:47.537 --> 18:49.756
<i>And so the gender</i>
<i>remained a secret,</i>

18:49.758 --> 18:53.176
<i>but Janet McIntyre's life</i>
<i>no longer was.</i>

18:53.178 --> 18:55.144
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

18:55.146 --> 18:56.729
Ted, what's going on?

18:56.731 --> 18:59.265
Nothing.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.550
Did I mention
that I'm the youngest architect

19:01.552 --> 19:03.987
in New York history
to have a skyscraper built?

19:03.989 --> 19:05.721
Oh.
So, I'm not quite

19:05.723 --> 19:08.241
as far beneath you
as you might think.

19:08.243 --> 19:10.276
Why would I think that?

19:10.278 --> 19:12.695
No reason, but this one time
in sixth grade,

19:12.697 --> 19:15.665
I saw a raccoon trapped
in a gutter, and I told my dad,

19:15.667 --> 19:17.533
and the firemen came
and got it out,

19:17.535 --> 19:20.503
so it's not like I pulled a baby
from a creek or anything,

19:20.505 --> 19:21.754
but at least
I didn't ignore it

19:21.756 --> 19:24.674
and keep lighting bugs on fire
with my magnifying glass.

19:24.676 --> 19:26.793
We had one promise,
and you broke it.

19:26.795 --> 19:28.661
What are you talking about?

19:28.663 --> 19:30.579
You looked me up, and now
you find me intimidating.

19:30.581 --> 19:32.849
Why-Why would I find you
intimidating, okay?

19:32.851 --> 19:35.084
It's not like
I donated a kidney,

19:35.086 --> 19:36.352
but I donated blood once,

19:36.354 --> 19:37.586
although I wound up fainting,

19:37.588 --> 19:39.722
and they had to put it
all back in.

19:39.724 --> 19:41.941
I was so excited about this.

19:41.943 --> 19:45.228
But now you're just a blubbering
idiot like the rest of them.

19:45.230 --> 19:46.696
No, I ain't!

19:46.698 --> 19:49.782
I mean, no, I never do
that thing you says.

19:50.952 --> 19:52.652
What I mean is,
you gooder than me

19:52.654 --> 19:55.705
no make difference!

19:55.707 --> 19:58.124
<i>And that's that.</i>

19:58.126 --> 20:00.493
I wish to God I'd never
clicked on that link.

20:00.495 --> 20:01.911
I'm sorry, Ted.

20:01.913 --> 20:03.779
We were just
trying to help.

20:03.781 --> 20:06.165
I said it was meddling
and manipulative,

20:06.167 --> 20:08.167
but Kevin insisted we butt in.

20:11.889 --> 20:13.256
No, it's my fault.

20:13.258 --> 20:14.807
I never should have looked.

20:14.809 --> 20:17.677
In the battle
of mystery versus history,

20:17.679 --> 20:19.645
it's best
not to know.

20:19.647 --> 20:22.315
Lily Pad?

20:22.317 --> 20:23.850
What?

20:23.852 --> 20:26.235
We're having a boy.

20:27.421 --> 20:29.489
We're having a boy.

20:29.491 --> 20:30.806
We're having a boy!
You're having a boy!

20:30.808 --> 20:32.859
We're having a...
we're having a boy.

20:32.861 --> 20:34.360
We're having a boy.

20:34.362 --> 20:35.695
We're having
a boy.

20:35.697 --> 20:38.081
I'll go buy
some blue paint.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.551
It needs sharpening.

20:50.553 --> 20:54.138
You see? I told you three days
would go by in no time.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.806
Phineas, take us up!

20:55.808 --> 20:57.224
Well, in case
you were wondering,

20:57.226 --> 20:59.527
it rained the entire time
I was in the Caribbean.

20:59.529 --> 21:03.708
Thank you for asking.
