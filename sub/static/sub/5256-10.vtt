01:57.618 --> 01:59.818
<i>(Western music]</i>

01:59.820 --> 02:02.654
<i>Our story starts in the 1600s.</i>

02:02.656 --> 02:05.524
<i>There were people called</i>
<i>the Pueblo Indians,</i>

02:05.526 --> 02:10.829
<i>and they were living</i>
<i>peacefully, doing their thing,</i>

02:10.831 --> 02:11.763
<i>being Indians.</i>

02:11.765 --> 02:15.567
<i>There's this Pueblo Indian</i>
<i>named Po'pay.</i>

02:15.569 --> 02:16.668
<i>He's, like, very charismatic,</i>

02:16.670 --> 02:20.205
<i>everyone wanted</i>
<i>to hang out with him,</i>

02:20.207 --> 02:22.141
<i>s--life of the party.</i>

02:22.143 --> 02:24.776
That would be Po'pay.
[both laugh]

02:24.778 --> 02:29.715
<i>So, in 1675,</i>
<i>the Spanish came in</i>

02:29.717 --> 02:30.849
<i>and took over the Pueblo area,</i>

02:30.851 --> 02:36.688
<i>so Po'pay was like,</i>
This is my place.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.289
Don't bother us.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.024
We're doing our Indian stuff.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.026
<i>The governor,</i>
<i>Treviño, was like,</i>

02:41.028 --> 02:44.997
I'm worried about you Pueblo
Indians and your teachings,

02:44.999 --> 02:50.035
and I'm worried that it's gonna
impede on my Christian beliefs.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.905
<i>So, they--</i>
<i>he gathered up</i>

02:52.907 --> 02:57.176
<i>a bunch of Pueblo Indian</i>
<i>leaders and he was like,</i>

02:57.178 --> 02:58.210
You're a witch!

02:58.212 --> 02:59.945
<i>He killed like four of 'em.</i>

02:59.947 --> 03:04.082
<i>So Po'pay was like,</i>
I'm gonna get you back.

03:04.084 --> 03:08.253
So one night, Po'pay
gets a message

03:08.255 --> 03:12.124
from this god called
Pohe-Yemo--

03:12.126 --> 03:13.192
<i>- Shamu.</i>
- Which sounds like Shamu!

03:13.194 --> 03:16.094
My brothers called me Shamu
when I was little.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.197
- That's not nice.
- It's not nice.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.665
I was like, [bleep] you!

03:19.667 --> 03:23.202
<i>So, Pohe-Yemo,</i>
<i>he was like,</i>

03:23.204 --> 03:26.805
You need to get
everybody together.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.941
You speak all the dialects.

03:28.943 --> 03:32.611
You--you have the power
to get everybody together

03:32.613 --> 03:36.648
and--and bring--and--
and bring everybody together

03:36.650 --> 03:40.819
to revolt, and so,
let's do this, like,

03:40.821 --> 03:42.788
use your powers for good.

03:42.790 --> 03:47.192
<i>So Po'pay gathers</i>
<i>70 different communities.</i>

03:47.194 --> 03:51.663
<i>Po'pay gives all these leaders</i>
<i>a piece of rope,</i>

03:51.665 --> 03:54.266
<i>and he was like,</i>
Every day, you untie a knot,

03:54.268 --> 03:58.837
and then when these knots
are untied, we gonna revolt!

03:58.839 --> 04:02.975
So every day, the Poi--
the Pueblos untied the knots,

04:02.977 --> 04:08.113
<i>they use like deerskin,</i>
<i>like smoke signals,</i>

04:08.115 --> 04:11.149
<i>um, text messages...</i>

04:11.151 --> 04:13.952
[laughter]

04:13.954 --> 04:18.290
- But,
Po'pay was super insecure,

04:18.292 --> 04:21.293
<i>and he was like,</i>
I don't trust anybody,

04:21.295 --> 04:25.330
and so, you guys
have to keep secrets,

04:25.332 --> 04:26.765
and if you
don't keep a secret,

04:26.767 --> 04:32.771
I will, like, "Soprano" style
murder you.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.805
<i>But then there were</i>
<i>two assholes</i>

04:33.807 --> 04:37.776
<i>who ended up telling the secret</i>
<i>anyway to a priest,</i>

04:37.778 --> 04:40.178
<i>so the--so the priest says</i>
<i>to the governor,</i>

04:40.180 --> 04:45.150
Look, I just heard
from these two little bitches

04:45.152 --> 04:50.088
that...that Po'pay--
he's angry,

04:50.090 --> 04:52.758
and he's got all these Pueblos
that are coming for you.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.728
<i>And then Juan...Pablo--no,</i>

04:56.730 --> 04:59.965
Juan Pablo is my gardener.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.802
Juan Francisco Treviño
told all the Spanish people,

05:03.804 --> 05:08.940
Get to Santa Fe!
Some [bleep] about to go down.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.376
<i>Close the doors.</i>

05:11.378 --> 05:14.713
<i>And he's like,</i>
Nobody's coming in here...

05:14.715 --> 05:16.782
no matter what.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.284
<i>And so, somebody</i>
<i>comes to Po'pay and is like,</i>

05:19.286 --> 05:23.055
Hey, look, you gotta start
the revolt like ASAP.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.290
Like, immediately.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.325
<i>He was like,</i>

05:26.327 --> 05:29.194
You need to send out
a Bat-Signal...

05:29.196 --> 05:32.764
A smoke signal...
not a Bat-Signal.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.066
<i>So he was like,</i>

05:34.068 --> 05:36.268
Hey, listen, Pueblos,

05:36.270 --> 05:37.669
tonight's the night.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.072
We're gonna [bleep] up
some Spanish people.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.908
We're doing this now!
We're revolting!

05:42.910 --> 05:47.746
Come on, Pueblos,
let's get it together.

05:47.748 --> 05:51.883
<i>And, so, in August 1680,</i>

05:51.885 --> 05:55.354
<i>Po'pay marched 2,500 people</i>

05:55.356 --> 05:56.822
<i>into--into Santa Fe,</i>

05:56.824 --> 06:01.360
<i>and he went to the palace</i>
<i>and he started attacking them,</i>

06:01.362 --> 06:04.830
<i>and they were--they were</i>
<i>shooting back and forth</i>

06:04.832 --> 06:06.198
<i>at each other,</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:08.066
<i>and Po'pay was like,</i>

06:08.068 --> 06:12.070
We're gonna show
that governor who's boss.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.072
<i>Po'pay cut off</i>
<i>their water supply.</i>

06:14.074 --> 06:17.242
<i>He's like,</i>
If you don't have water,

06:17.244 --> 06:19.311
you can't do anything.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.846
<i>And they were like,</i>
What do we do?

06:20.848 --> 06:24.783
They just sat there
like a bunch of bitches.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.420
<i>After six days,</i>
<i>Po'pay was like,</i>

06:28.422 --> 06:32.824
I'm tired of losing men.
I'm tired of people dying.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.061
I got things to do.
I'm hungry.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.998
<i>He's like,</i> I'ma let you go.
I'ma let you guys go.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.468
<i>Normally, in history,</i>
<i>you hear about Indians</i>

06:43.470 --> 06:45.270
<i>gettin', like, [bleep]ed,</i>

06:45.272 --> 06:49.141
but this story,
the Indians came out on top.

06:49.143 --> 06:53.145
<i>He was like,</i>
pfft, [bleep] you guys.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.279
Burn it down.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.848
This is my jam.
This is my palace.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.118

<i>burned down all the stuff</i>

07:00.120 --> 07:01.720
<i>the Spaniards had put up,</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:04.156
and New Mexico,

<i>has Spanish influence,</i>
<i>Indian influence,</i>

07:07.895 --> 07:13.031

influence as well.

07:13.033 --> 07:13.999

07:14.001 --> 07:15.934
- Do you feel like
we've talked--

07:15.936 --> 07:18.303
Do you feel like we've talked
America enough?

07:18.305 --> 07:19.171
- We do. We--
- What else?

07:19.173 --> 07:22.307
- I do.
- What else do you want from us?

Hello, I'm Mike Still,
and today we're gonna

07:54.908 --> 07:57.809
talk about
Ernest Thompson Seton,

07:57.811 --> 08:02.814
the founder of
the Boy Scouts of America.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.815
- Cheers.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.821
<i>- Ernest Thompson Seton</i>
<i>was born to a really mean dad.</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:12.824
<i>His life at home was awful,</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:15.227
<i>so he ran out in the woods</i>

08:15.229 --> 08:18.163
<i>and it was a place</i>
<i>that he could truly explore,</i>

08:18.165 --> 08:21.833
<i>and he said,</i>
I am a human that exists

08:21.835 --> 08:24.736
among birds, among beavers,

08:24.738 --> 08:28.406
among badgers, among animals.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.843
He got to fantasize
about being an Indian

08:31.845 --> 08:35.714
<i>and he drew the most beautiful</i>
<i>pictures of birds.</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:39.684
So in 1893, he meets
his girlfriend's father,

08:39.686 --> 08:41.219
Fitz Randolph,
and he was like,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.154
We got all this problems
out in New Mexico.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.890
We got these wolves.
They're killing us.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.793
All of our cattle--
they're getting out there,

08:48.795 --> 08:49.561
they're eating the cattle.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.729
We just need someone to,
like, help us out.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.265
We just need someone.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.834
<i>And Ernest is like,</i>

08:55.836 --> 08:57.869
I'll do it.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.205
No problem.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.474
He's spent a ton of time
in the wild.

09:02.476 --> 09:03.408
He's very used to this.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.912
So, Ernest gets out
to New Mexico, and he's like,

09:06.914 --> 09:08.780
I hear there's
all these wolves to kill.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.016
<i>And the cowboys are like,</i>

09:11.018 --> 09:14.252
No, no, no, man.
There's one.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.821
His name is Lobo,

09:16.823 --> 09:20.926
the King of Currumpaw-ba-ba.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.895
The King of Currumpaw.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.065
<i>Seton's like,</i>
Let's do this.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.900
<i>And then it says that</i>
<i>he works through the woods,</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:31.002
<i>he's tracking the animal.</i>

09:31.004 --> 09:32.137
<i>He looks,</i>
<i>he picks up a leaf.</i>

09:32.139 --> 09:35.373
Oh, Lobo,
you've been here.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.441
And Lobo's like,

09:36.443 --> 09:39.311
Yes, you know I have.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.046
You know I have.

09:41.048 --> 09:45.784
Well,
I'm on my way to get you.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.987
All he wants to do
is kill this wolf.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.255
<i>[arrow whooshing noise]</i>

09:50.257 --> 09:52.958

<i>But he can't do it.</i>

10:07.874 --> 10:10.175
<i>He's...</i>

10:10.177 --> 10:14.479
<i>a total smart [bleep]ing wolf.</i>

10:14.481 --> 10:17.082
So he's hunting Lobo
for four months.

10:17.084 --> 10:17.949
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:19.317

10:25.359 --> 10:28.226
<i>with the hottest wolf</i>
<i>that's ever existed,</i>

10:28.228 --> 10:31.162

10:31.164 --> 10:32.330
Real hot.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.199
So, um...

10:34.201 --> 10:36.234
<i>- Lobo and Blanca</i>
<i>were hanging out,</i>

10:36.236 --> 10:40.071
<i>and they were the super coolest</i>
<i>humans to ever hang out.</i>

10:40.073 --> 10:43.008
<i>They were super chill.</i>

10:43.010 --> 10:44.009
<i>Ernest realizes,</i>

10:44.011 --> 10:46.845
The only thing
that could kill Lobo

10:46.847 --> 10:50.081
is the most dangerous
weapon of all...

10:50.083 --> 10:51.282
Love.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.985
<i>Ernest and his boys</i>
<i>go after Blanca,</i>

10:53.987 --> 10:55.420
<i>they go after her,</i>

10:55.422 --> 10:57.489
<i>and they--</i>
<i>they capture Blanca.</i>

10:57.491 --> 11:01.926
They know that she is the way
to get Lobo.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.963
<i>So then, they pull her back</i>
<i>and they kill her.</i>

11:06.465 --> 11:09.134
Just totally done.
It's done. They got her.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.002
They got her!
They got her.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.938
<i>And Seton's like,</i>
Now we can get Lobo.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.408
<i>A--a--a--a--and he takes</i>
<i>her corpse</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:20.345
<i>back to his camp,</i>
<i>and he hears, that night,</i>

11:20.347 --> 11:23.882
<i>the sad--the sad howl.</i>

11:23.884 --> 11:26.985
[howling]

11:35.161 --> 11:38.029
[laughs]

11:38.031 --> 11:43.068
<i>And Lobo came closer than he</i>
<i>ever did before, and...</i>

11:43.070 --> 11:45.437
<i>[banging noises]</i>

11:45.439 --> 11:47.138
<i>He was caught by four traps.</i>

11:47.140 --> 11:50.175
<i>And Seton came out,</i>
<i>and was like,</i>

11:50.177 --> 11:51.643
Got him.
We got him.

11:51.645 --> 11:54.245
<i>But then, he looked</i>
<i>in this animal's eyes,</i>

11:54.247 --> 11:56.081
<i>and he realized this was</i>
<i>someone that was heartbroken.</i>

11:56.083 --> 11:59.651
<i>This was someone that was</i>
<i>completely heartbroken.</i>

11:59.653 --> 12:02.153
<i>So Seton said,</i>
I'm not gonna kill him.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.656
I'm gonna--
<i>he carried him back,</i>

12:04.658 --> 12:06.324
<i>he gave him meat,</i>

12:06.326 --> 12:07.092
<i>and then he died.</i>

12:07.094 --> 12:09.561
<i>But this [bleep]ed him up.</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:10.695
<i>He couldn't believe</i>
<i>that he had, like,</i>

12:10.697 --> 12:13.898
<i>killed this animal.</i>
<i>Yeah, he was just like,</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:14.966
What the [bleep]
did I do here?

12:14.968 --> 12:18.203
Like, I [bleep]ing killed
this beautiful animal,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.171
that somehow it was okay
to, like, kill things?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.440
Why?
Why?

12:22.442 --> 12:25.944
Why?
Like, in capital letters.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.078
<i>So he put out a book.</i>

12:27.080 --> 12:30.682
<i>It was called</i>
<i>"Wild Animals I Have Known."</i>

12:30.684 --> 12:32.951
<i>He gives the animals</i>
<i>in his book</i>

12:32.953 --> 12:34.018
<i>personalities and thoughts,</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:36.955
and most people can't [bleep]ing
deal with that.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.958
It blows their [bleep]ing minds.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.061
So after years...
[sighs]

12:44.630 --> 12:46.264
<i>Years later, in 1902,</i>

12:46.266 --> 12:50.335
<i>he's writing books,</i>
<i>he's drawing pictures of birds.</i>

12:50.337 --> 12:52.403
<i>And then all of a sudden,</i>
<i>he hears all this noise,</i>

12:52.405 --> 12:54.939
<i>and he looks out--</i>
What is going on out here?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.175
<i>Tons of boys start</i>
<i>vandalizing his house.</i>

12:57.177 --> 13:01.379
<i>He just runs after these boys,</i>
<i>and they're like,</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:03.615
Sorry, man, we come
from troubled homes.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.250
We had abusive dads.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.718
<i>And Ernest is like,</i>

13:06.720 --> 13:10.121
Whoa, what the [bleep]?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.123
You're just like me.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.224
<i>He says,</i>
All right.

13:13.226 --> 13:17.195
I need to get
all these boys together

13:17.197 --> 13:19.230
and hang out on Easter.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.000
<i>And they're like,</i>
What is this guy's deal?

13:22.002 --> 13:24.702
We have no idea
what he's going to do.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.004
<i>And he's like,</i>

13:26.006 --> 13:27.238
You thought I was gonna
reprimand you.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.075
Guess what?
We're learning about woods!

13:31.077 --> 13:32.677
We're learning about survival.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.379
We're learning about trees.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.647
We're learning about
all the things

13:35.649 --> 13:38.149
that humans need to know
to prosper.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.687
<i>He called his hangout</i>
<i>the Woodcraft Indians.</i>

13:42.689 --> 13:48.426
<i>It eventually grew into</i>
<i>the Boy Scouts of America.</i>

13:48.428 --> 13:50.595
<i>[wolf howl]</i>

13:51.297 --> 13:54.165
All right, so here we
have--we're gonna do

13:54.167 --> 13:56.067
a slip knot.

13:56.069 --> 13:56.935
- Slip knot.
- Pretty easy.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.137
So, all we want to do
is go over...

13:59.139 --> 14:02.073
hold on, it's already
pretty bent.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.576
So we go over this,
right?

14:04.578 --> 14:06.778
Then we go over that.

14:06.780 --> 14:10.081
Oh, so we're gonna go
over each knot.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.083
- Knot!

14:13.586 --> 14:14.719
And, so now,
it's just a rope.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.621
- Not--just hold on.
Wait--to go over here...

14:16.623 --> 14:19.757
<i>We're gonna pull this though</i>
<i>that--Oh, wait, hold on...</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:26.130
- I believe we are ready
to get started!

14:26.132 --> 14:27.365
[applause]

14:27.367 --> 14:31.469
- My name is Norma,
and I come from the planet Nyto.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.172
- I'm Bacoscia
from the planet Venusia.

14:34.174 --> 14:38.376
On my planet, women rule.
[whoos]

14:38.378 --> 14:39.043
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.747
All right, coming up
is Daryl Walters

14:42.749 --> 14:45.950
from the planet Mudocon.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.019
His diet consists
of whiskey and rice cakes.

14:48.021 --> 14:53.758
He's a Leo, and he wants to run
for President one day.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.327
- L-O-L!
- [laughter]

14:56.329 --> 14:57.896
- Hey, I finished
all the vodka, so--

14:57.898 --> 14:58.997
- Do you want to
do a shot, though?

14:58.999 --> 15:01.799
- I'll do a shot with you.
To every ufologist...

15:01.801 --> 15:04.769
who is seeking
the truth out there.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.439
Who's digging deep
and doing the legwork.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.741
This one goes for you.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.745
Oh, Mommy.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.048
Hello, today we're gonna be
talking about

15:17.050 --> 15:21.920
the Roswell UFO crash of 1947.

15:25.824 --> 15:26.457
[burps]

15:26.459 --> 15:30.762
<i>So Mac Brazel, a foreman</i>
<i>for a sheep rancher,</i>

15:30.764 --> 15:34.265
he sees some metallic pieces

15:34.267 --> 15:35.934
laying opossum--
upon his acreage.

15:35.936 --> 15:39.037
<i>And he's like,</i>
Well this is very interesting.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.839
I mean, what the ding-dong
could this really be?

15:41.841 --> 15:46.244
There are some things
going on on this ranch

15:46.246 --> 15:48.980
that defy human explanation.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.884
<i>So immediately, he contacts</i>
<i>the local Army Air Force base.</i>

15:52.886 --> 15:56.421
<i>They send out a guy named</i>
<i>Major Jesse Marcel,</i>

15:56.423 --> 16:00.858
<i>a very decorated,</i>
<i>very smart individual,</i>

16:00.860 --> 16:03.061
<i>and Major Jesse Marcel's like,</i>

16:03.063 --> 16:05.330
Well this is not from us.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.230
This is not from the Air Force.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.568
This is not from
a crashed airplane.

16:10.570 --> 16:15.506
This is not crashed
from a satellite.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.008
This must be alien.

16:17.010 --> 16:21.379
<i>So, J--Major Jesse Marcel</i>
<i>contacts the local paper</i>

16:21.381 --> 16:22.013
<i>and says,</i>

16:22.015 --> 16:26.084
We have discovered...

16:26.086 --> 16:29.487
a crashed flying saucer.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.823
Holy [bleep].

16:31.825 --> 16:32.790
In the newspaper,
they actually put

16:32.792 --> 16:36.828
<i>The military has recovered</i>
<i>alien spacecrafts--</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:42.000
<i>space...craft that has</i>
<i>crashed with wreckage.</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:45.436
The Pentagon is freaking out.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.338
So they're basically saying,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.040
Oh, Jesus Christ,
Project Mogul,

16:49.042 --> 16:51.175
you know that thing
we're doing?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.978
The balloon that we're testing
with microphones

16:53.980 --> 16:59.217
trying to detect
Russian nuclear activity?

16:59.219 --> 17:02.286
Our top-secret project
has crashed

17:02.288 --> 17:04.956
on a sheep rancher's
property, man.

17:04.958 --> 17:11.262
<i>This was a--the most</i>
<i>top secret</i>

17:11.264 --> 17:12.597
<i>project going on at the time,</i>

17:12.599 --> 17:16.601
and Project Mogul
was a weather balloom

17:16.603 --> 17:20.071
<i>atmospheric craft that was</i>
<i>going to detect</i>

17:20.073 --> 17:25.209
sounds of
a nuclear test going on

17:25.211 --> 17:26.944
with nuclear weapons.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.480
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>the Pentagon--</i>

17:29.482 --> 17:31.182
<i>they are swarming the area.</i>

17:31.184 --> 17:35.119
<i>They're cornering off</i>
<i>the whole area.</i>

17:35.121 --> 17:36.320
<i>They're picking up debris.</i>

17:36.322 --> 17:39.223
<i>The Pentagon kept the Air Force</i>

17:39.225 --> 17:41.059
<i>in the dark</i>
<i>about this whole thing.</i>

17:41.061 --> 17:43.594
<i>So Major Jesse Marcel said,</i>

17:43.596 --> 17:47.398
We are in the midst of
a huge cover-up.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.300
Holy [bleep],
this is crazy.

17:49.302 --> 17:53.137
Which, for the Pentagon,
is exactly what they wanted.

17:53.139 --> 17:57.008
Secret Military.
Alien.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.210
The perfect smoke screen.

17:59.212 --> 18:03.014
Years go on and on,
and no one gave a [bleep],

18:03.016 --> 18:05.183
<i>and the local town people</i>
<i>sort of forgot about it,</i>

18:05.185 --> 18:06.484
<i>and it wasn't a big deal.</i>

18:06.486 --> 18:07.518
They're like,
Oh, yeah, well, we don't--

18:07.520 --> 18:09.087
not really sure what happened,
blah blah blah.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.056
<i>Everyone forgot about it</i>
<i>until 1978.</i>

18:12.058 --> 18:15.626
<i>Jesse Marcel,</i>
<i>now a very aging man,</i>

18:15.628 --> 18:20.098
<i>calls up famed ufologist</i>
<i>Stanton T. Friedman.</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:23.634
I need to tell you
a little bit of a story.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.304
It's the story of
the Roswell UFO crash.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.506
<i>Stanton Friedman's like,</i>

18:28.508 --> 18:30.508
[whispers]
I'm all ears.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.143
Give me the juice.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.113
Gimme the juice
that I so desire.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.586
We're on a--
I'm sorry, I'm lost.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.355
Okay, uh--
- We're talking about Roswell.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.191
- [laughs]
And...yeah.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.393
- [laughs]

18:49.395 --> 18:51.429
<i>- So, Stanton Friedman</i>
<i>flies down there</i>

18:51.431 --> 18:53.464
<i>from Northern California,</i>
<i>and is just, like,</i>

18:53.466 --> 18:56.267
I'm lovin' this.
This is a great situation.

18:56.269 --> 19:00.338
<i>Marcel, he gives him</i>
<i>the whole Roswell spiel.</i>

19:00.340 --> 19:02.340
<i>Stanton Friedman hears</i>
<i>all about this,</i>

19:02.342 --> 19:04.609
<i>and so he's like,</i>

19:04.611 --> 19:05.376
Pay dirt. Eureka.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.346
I am going to write a book.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.682
<i>And write a book he does.</i>

19:11.684 --> 19:12.583
<i>He writes a bestseller.</i>

19:12.585 --> 19:17.355
Roswell now, which had been
forgotten about for 30 years,

19:17.357 --> 19:20.958
becomes a huge deal,
and thus is born

19:20.960 --> 19:23.327
<i>a whole new generation</i>
<i>of ufologists.</i>

19:23.329 --> 19:26.264
It must be
an alien spacecraft...

19:26.266 --> 19:29.567
from another planet.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.301
Capisce?
- Capisce.

19:30.303 --> 19:34.372
<i>- In 1995, citizens kept on</i>
<i>writing in, saying</i>

19:34.374 --> 19:38.342
<i>Can you please tell us what</i>
<i>happened with Roswell?</i>

19:38.344 --> 19:39.577
<i>So the Pentagon says,</i>

19:39.579 --> 19:40.711
All right,
you deserve to know.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.414
We will release all the
Freedom Informa--

19:43.416 --> 19:47.251
Freedom of Information Act--
FOIA documents.

19:47.253 --> 19:47.985
<i>They do so,</i>

19:47.987 --> 19:51.722
<i>and the whole story</i>
<i>about Project Mogul comes out.</i>

19:51.724 --> 19:54.792
The reality of the situation
is--is that...

19:54.794 --> 19:57.929
extraterrestrial beings
from another planet

19:57.931 --> 20:01.432
did not crash in the desert
of Roswell, New Mexico.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.870
<i>And, you know, now today</i>
<i>Roswell, the town,</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:09.640
<i>refuses to acknowledge</i>
<i>Project Mogul,</i>

20:09.642 --> 20:11.676
<i>so they are the ones projecting</i>

20:11.678 --> 20:14.745
<i>the UFO angle</i>
<i>with all this stuff.</i>

20:14.747 --> 20:18.282
Well, this is a--
kind of a rendition of

20:18.284 --> 20:21.819
the typical
pleiadian gray alien.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.355
He's got the
teardrop almond eyes,

20:24.357 --> 20:28.459
the nose
with the limited slits,

20:28.461 --> 20:29.694
and...in the mouth.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.462
- How much did you pay
for this thing?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.397
- 450 bucks.
- Jesus.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.433
- Got a good deal.
- They saw you coming...

20:35.435 --> 20:38.703
They didn't show you the back
part 'till you left?

20:38.705 --> 20:39.837
- I didn't see that
'till I got home,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.707

a--quite a heel for that.
