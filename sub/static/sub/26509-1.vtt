00:44.680 --> 00:47.800
(STREAKER)

01:24.280 --> 01:26.640
That's me, Baltasar Näf.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.160
Part-time teacher at
Baden High School.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.880
Actually I'd like to
teach more classes,

01:33.120 --> 01:34.840
in addition to my class, 3B,

01:35.240 --> 01:37.960
but the principal, Mr Ziegler,

01:38.160 --> 01:40.640
would rather I do the school finances.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.440
But you must be wondering:

01:43.840 --> 01:45.520
is the beard real?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.640
No, but that's another story.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.920
This one began eight weeks ago.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.240
With this guy: Gottfried Keller.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.560
The great Swiss writer

01:57.880 --> 02:00.320
was born in Zurich in 1819.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.640
After a childhood prank,

02:01.960 --> 02:04.440
he was barred from higher education,

02:04.600 --> 02:07.720
and began training
as a landscape painter.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.039
Destitute, he lived with his mother

02:11.200 --> 02:14.280
until receiving a writing scholarship.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.400
His work delights both young and old.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.400
"What lovely wonder do my eyes behold?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.160
A wee fountain... "

02:26.480 --> 02:28.000
Stop, stop, stop.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.760
Can't you hear

02:31.920 --> 02:34.240
the tenderness in the language?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.360
"What lovely wonder," writes Keller,

02:38.520 --> 02:41.480
and not just "fountain."

02:41.640 --> 02:42.760
"Wee fountain."

02:47.280 --> 02:48.720
Who will read next?

02:54.880 --> 02:57.400
Thanks, Annina.
Maybe someone else?

02:57.920 --> 03:00.320
Striver, striver, striver!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.600
Come on.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.880
Elisabeth, wait.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.800
Yes, Mr Näf?
- Look at your clothes.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.680
You can't go to school like that.
- No?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.720
It's too revealing.
Up top and in between.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.360
It doesn't matter, Mr. Näf.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.720
What you wear does matter.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.200
And stop saying "Mr Näf."
- What should I say?

03:36.640 --> 03:37.800
Dad.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.600
Not everybody has to know.
- But they do.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.800
No, not the new kids.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.480
A little less skin, please.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.440
Hey, Balz.
- Hello, Anja.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.040
So, you like my new Lamborghini?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.160
I saw you looking at it.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.120
What? It's yours?

04:23.280 --> 04:25.520
Sure. I'm an Albanian.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.280
Is this salon really that profitable?

04:29.440 --> 04:32.200
More or less,
plus sports betting.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.280
You should try it.
I'll help you.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.240
Sunday is Baden vs. Solothurn.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.960
Bet on Baden and you'll win.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.240
You're sure?

04:45.920 --> 04:49.120
Of course.
I've got a kind of betting office.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.400
Give me your money.
I've got the best odds.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.280
Thanks.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.200
Betting and sports aren't my thing.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.760
No biggie.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.720
It's up to you.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.240
I'm doing the quarterly accounts.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.560
It's you.
Who else would be here so late.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.880
Karl, you promised me,

05:37.440 --> 05:39.840
if I raised funds
for the new sports field,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.440
and there was anything left over,

05:44.800 --> 05:48.480
that I'd get it for the Keller Museum.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.160
Does that offer still stand?
- Of course.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.560
Sure. Anything else?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.800
Hey, thanks!

05:57.640 --> 05:58.960
Thanks!

06:24.960 --> 06:27.120
What's up with you?
- Hey!

06:27.960 --> 06:29.960
Thanks to me there'll be a Keller Museum.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
Wow!

06:32.440 --> 06:33.480
Cool.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.200
Remember how I met your Mom?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.120
Yes, at a Gottfried Keller reading.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.520
And I'm named after his mother.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.320
Thanks.
- Yes, and before she died...

06:49.640 --> 06:52.960
100 years ago!
Time to find a new woman!

06:57.960 --> 07:01.400
Before she died,
our dream was to open

07:01.560 --> 07:03.400
a Gottfried Keller museum.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.240
Now the dream will come true.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.440
Great, Dad.
I'm sure she'd be proud of you.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.440
Shall I cook something?

07:31.240 --> 07:35.040
Soccer and literature
have a lot in common.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.040
They're for everyone.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.880
Incorruptible, unbribable...

07:40.200 --> 07:41.880
That's why it's wonderful

07:42.040 --> 07:44.080
that along with the FIFA Museum,

07:44.240 --> 07:47.600
we'll get a Gottfried Keller Museum.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.400
Thanks to one man,
and that man is Mr Näf.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.320
That's the "Haus zum goldenen Winkel,"

08:05.480 --> 08:08.520
where Gottfried Keller was born.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.520
The city will pay the remaining costs.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.520
Former councilor Leuenberger

08:14.680 --> 08:17.160
supported it personally.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.520
Just imagine it!

08:19.680 --> 08:23.000
A little museum in Keller's honor,

08:23.560 --> 08:26.520
with his furniture, books, slippers...

08:26.840 --> 08:28.480
Balz, we're talking

08:29.280 --> 08:33.240
about 280,000 Swiss francs?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.039
Is that correct?

08:35.200 --> 08:38.120
Yes, that's exactly the amount

08:38.280 --> 08:40.080
that I've saved.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.039
280,000?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.040
It wasn't easy,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.440
but I've worked on it for three years.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.240
We could use it for teacher parking!

08:51.560 --> 08:53.400
Or for the sports field.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.080
For FIFA-regulation turf.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.520
Yeah!

09:01.200 --> 09:04.240
But as teachers we can surely agree

09:04.400 --> 09:07.560
that Keller is more important than turf.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.520
Let's make the decision as a team.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.640
So, listen up.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.720
Who wants FIFA-regulation turf?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.720
Raise your hand.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.480
And opposed.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.960
Who wants the Gottfried Keller Museum?

09:28.400 --> 09:32.000
Sorry, Balz.
I think you can accept that.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.080
But you can't do this!

09:34.400 --> 09:37.760
You're reliable as always.
Thank you.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.280
Karl! You promised me!

09:41.840 --> 09:44.240
Let's move on to the next topic:

09:44.400 --> 09:47.480
Dirty coffee mugs in the classrooms.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.160
But everything's been prepared.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.960
Karl, please reconsider.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.400
You promised me.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.720
Please!

11:05.800 --> 11:08.760
This is the last time.
- Of course.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.120
Just this once and never again.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.520
Who knows about it?
- Just you and I.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.760
Okay, give me the money.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.600
But this is definitely the last time.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.560
The fans already think

11:30.720 --> 11:32.200
I'm too old to be goalie.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.080
I'm your biggest fan.
You're fantastic.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.680
That's when I knew what to do.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.960
Bet against our home team

11:45.120 --> 11:47.880
and use the winnings
to save my museum.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.360
Hello, Maya.
- Hello, Balz.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.400
I'm here for the money
for the sports field.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.240
Here is the authorization from Karl.
- Great.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.360
You can finally begin.
How much do you need?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.200
Everything.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.440
Everything?

12:25.320 --> 12:26.400
In cash?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.760
Yes, the construction firm
is old-fashioned.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.040
Hello.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.360
Go, Baden.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.560
I want to bet on the game after all.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.240
Perfect. Come in.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.600
Have a seat. How much?

13:07.760 --> 13:09.640
741,000 francs.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
What?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.840
741,000 francs?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.360
Yes.
- You're a real high roller.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.640
Mr Näf?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.280
Since when do you watch soccer?

13:44.600 --> 13:47.880
I'm supporting our team.
Go, Baden!

13:48.520 --> 13:51.560
Please don't.
There are other people here.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.920
So, cheers.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.440
Go, Baden! Go, Baden! Go, Baden!

14:42.760 --> 14:45.240
BADEN: 0, GUESTS:0.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.640
Hey!

16:01.800 --> 16:04.720
It's your fault I lost all that money!

16:05.040 --> 16:08.720
My fault?
- I heard you bribe the goalie.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.200
Oh, I see.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.400
When will you fix the next game?

16:14.560 --> 16:18.560
That was the last time.
He's my only contact.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.760
I lost a lot, too. I'm screwed.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.280
My Lamborghini is gone,
and this painting...

16:26.440 --> 16:28.920
What do I care about that crap?

16:29.080 --> 16:32.160
It was the money
for the school sports field.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.480
And I agreed with the city council.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.520
If this gets out, I'll be fired.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.480
The town will tar and feather me!

16:42.640 --> 16:45.200
I'll probably go to prison.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.400
Yes, probably.
Help me with this painting?

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
Nobody knew

17:00.360 --> 17:02.840
Fritzli's brother would strike again.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.240
You know him?
- Everybody knows him.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.920
He lives in Wettingen.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.040
One minute.
I just have to get dressed.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.599
Want a few eggs?
- No, thanks.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.200
You could do it again

17:28.520 --> 17:31.400
and interfere with one of the teams.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.560
I'll go to the bank and bet...

17:33.880 --> 17:36.880
Out of the question.
- Why?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.600
Betting on sports isn't sportsmanlike.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.320
Not sportsmanlike?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.920
But streaking into a game
is sportsmanlike?

17:45.760 --> 17:46.760
Sure.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.240
Streaking is a sport.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.240
The object is
to stay on the field, naked,

17:52.560 --> 17:54.280
for as long as possible.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.480
I train just as intensely

17:57.640 --> 17:59.400
as a professional athlete.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.640
Nonsense.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.120
Strategy,
stadium knowledge, endurance,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.920
undressing technique, tempo,

18:16.240 --> 18:18.160
interaction with the press...

18:18.320 --> 18:22.400
Most people think:
"Look a naked dude!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.480
Ha ha, that's funny!"

18:24.760 --> 18:28.360
They have no idea
what it takes to get there.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.080
No idea.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.000
A man has 741,000 francs debt.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.360
He has a net salary of 6,200 francs,

18:38.520 --> 18:41.200
and fixed costs at 3,500 francs.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.560
How long will it take
to repay his debt.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Annina.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.160
22 years, 9 months,
2 weeks and 5 days.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.080
Very good, Annina.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.560
I'm looking for the site manager.
- That's me.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
Great. I'm looking for you.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.720
We were in contact
about the payment...

19:28.040 --> 19:30.760
The payment
that hasn't been paid yet?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.960
That's right. That payment.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.280
Unfortunately,
there's a little problem.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.800
So I won't get my money today?
- No.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.520
It's not possible, sadly.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.280
Fine. Then pay on Friday.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.000
Otherwise we've got a real problem.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.880
Bingo.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.320
What's insider information
worth to you?

22:03.760 --> 22:06.960
Well, if it pays off,

22:09.160 --> 22:11.920
I'd give you 50% of the profit.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.640
Okay.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.760
Fifty-fifty.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.120
Fifty-fifty.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.640
On Wednesday at Stadion Breite,

22:21.800 --> 22:24.840
Fritzli's little brother
will streak again.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
To interfere with a team?
- It's not that.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.600
The streaker.
The streaker is the bet.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.800
You don't understand what I do.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.680
My clients like to bet on sports.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.480
Streaking is a sport.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.680
The streaker runs around
as long as possible

22:42.840 --> 22:44.880
until he's caught.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.840
Your clients could bet on that.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.960
Why bet on a streaker

22:52.120 --> 22:53.920
and not the game?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.640
Because it's something new.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.040
No.
Your idea is mentally retarded.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.560
Hello.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.640
You don't have to iron my hotpants.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.600
It's my pleasure.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.400
Thanks.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
TEACHER GAMBLES AWAY SCHOOL MONEY

23:49.200 --> 23:50.600
Baltasar.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.520
Baltasar.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.080
Lost is your pride.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.000
Forever shall it be a thorn in your side.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.600
Gottfried, no!

24:11.160 --> 24:14.840
So, what's next on the program?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.400
I'm considering

24:16.560 --> 24:20.400
betting the 25 babies
I won last time.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.960
Good idea.
I've got all sorts of games.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.160
Chiasso vs. Schaffhausen.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.160
Biel vs. Wohlen?
- Boring.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.840
Zurich vs. Vaduz?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.240
Maybe I'll just
buy my wife that necklace

24:34.560 --> 24:37.000
she really wants.
- Okay.

24:37.160 --> 24:40.920
I have something very different,
exclusive.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.880
Just for my best clients.
- Really?

24:45.240 --> 24:46.320
Yes.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.680
It's a kind of... new sport.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.600
I'm sorry. I've got bad news.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.840
It's about the money.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.200
Yeah?

25:15.520 --> 25:17.920
I have to take this.
My hairdresser.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.960
What?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.280
You're an awesome guy, bro.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.240
Whatever. All my clients

25:26.560 --> 25:29.400
are crazy about your streaker idea.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.280
Fritzli's brother streaked like you said.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.320
Go, go, go!

25:36.200 --> 25:39.560
He stayed on the field
for 49 whole seconds!

25:39.880 --> 25:42.280
The guy's a real athlete!

25:43.760 --> 25:46.920
My clients want more.
When's his next game?

25:49.360 --> 25:52.080
Why should I tell you that?

25:54.120 --> 25:55.920
Your cut, that's why.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.680
Thirty-seven.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.240
37,000 francs?
What can I do with that?

26:10.400 --> 26:14.880
Wipe my ass?
- It's the first five percent.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.440
The rest is temporarily unavailable.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.480
Because of the added value tax.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.760
Oh, added value tax. I see.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.800
One, two, three, four.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.400
For me, for having to wait.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.680
That's over ten percent.
- Exactly.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.840
From now on it's cash in hand.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.640
Or should I talk to the administration?

26:48.680 --> 26:50.640
Leave me alone!

26:50.800 --> 26:52.560
Don't touch me!

26:53.440 --> 26:54.920
You're mean!

26:56.840 --> 26:59.480
Not in the car!
I don't want to go!

27:02.520 --> 27:04.640
My mother is on the local council!

27:17.120 --> 27:20.240
Is something wrong?
- Your sticker is expired.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.720
Replace it right away, Mr Näf.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.120
Recognize me?

27:27.280 --> 27:30.160
My daughter is in your class.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.000
Striver...
I mean Strebel, Annina. Yes.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.920
I see.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.120
It's nice to see you.
- You, too.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.240
I'll take care of the sticker.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.400
No! Help!

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Get in!
- I feel dizzy!

27:46.320 --> 27:49.720
What did he do?
- He's a streaker.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.080
Streaker?
- We're taking him into custody.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.560
You go to jail for that?

27:56.720 --> 27:59.240
Yes,
if there's proof it's premeditated.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.480
I have to go.
- Okay.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.000
Two months?
- The problem is

28:11.160 --> 28:13.520
they found all my material.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.000
And Commissar Strebel is a striver.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.400
You thinking about starting?
- Streaking?

28:23.720 --> 28:26.640
Are you nuts?
I'm a respected teacher.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.360
I'd be a laughing stock.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.480
I'd never see my daughter again.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.560
My ex-girlfriend

28:38.720 --> 28:41.360
tried very hard to understand...

28:41.520 --> 28:45.720
Interesting,
but do you know other streakers?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.560
Why?

28:49.360 --> 28:51.440
Get lost, you dirty capitalist!

28:51.600 --> 28:54.400
People like you ruin our sport!

28:54.720 --> 28:58.200
I hope you choke
on your money in hell!

29:00.120 --> 29:02.320
Yes?
- When is his next streak?

29:02.480 --> 29:05.160
Tell me now,
or we'll lose a fortune.

29:05.640 --> 29:08.760
If it's Wednesday,
will you pay on Friday?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.600
Wednesday?
You're an awesome guy!

29:13.680 --> 29:16.240
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...

29:16.400 --> 29:17.840
Four days.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.240
Oh, excuse me.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.240
Excuse me.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.680
What?
- What? Are you serious?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.840
Fuck off, little pervert.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.480
What? Streaking?
What's wrong with you?

29:57.720 --> 30:00.360
Surprise,
newspaper by the unemployed.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.280
Surprise,
newspaper by the unemployed.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.960
Okay.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.520
Do you own this?
- My father-in-law.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.320
He emigrated.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.560
Come here.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.880
Here, take a seat.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.560
This is Stadion Kleinfeld in Kriens.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.560
Capacity: 5,100 people. 540 Seats.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.160
You will be located here.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.840
It's 46.5 feet
to the edge of the field.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.920
Got it?

31:14.280 --> 31:16.720
Sure, boss.
- Good. Come with me.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.840
So, this is a model of the situation.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.520
I built it 1:1 for you.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.080
You start here.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.400
That's not a chair.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.120
This is the barrier.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.960
It's the same height as in the stadium.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.920
Undress, undress, undress here.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.120
And in you go!

31:51.080 --> 31:53.400
Any questions?
- No.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.880
Good.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.200
And go!

32:30.600 --> 32:32.960
... pull, and it's off.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.040
Okay, I have just the thing.
- Very good.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
Hello. New soccer boots?

32:40.520 --> 32:43.720
Let's look at two different models.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.840
So, pull the pants down
with both hands,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.960
then yank them forward.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.160
It's not easy. I tried.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.520
Have you done this before?
- No.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.560
Doesn't it look a bit gay?

33:10.400 --> 33:14.000
No, no.
The thong works the same way.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.960
Yank it forward, but be careful

33:17.120 --> 33:21.400
it doesn't get stuck on your... ass.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.160
Awesome!

33:48.160 --> 33:50.120
It'd better work.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.760
It'll work.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.280
Go, go, go!

34:23.199 --> 34:25.120
That's your streaker?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.840
Yes.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.560
Surprise!

35:03.160 --> 35:05.280
He's not on the field!

35:23.320 --> 35:25.120
He isn't naked!

35:55.480 --> 35:57.280
Four, five,

35:57.600 --> 35:59.720
six and 7,000.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.480
Is that it?
- Somebody bet correctly.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.880
I had to give him his winnings.
- What?

36:09.040 --> 36:12.720
Down to the second?
- Yes, he won 30,000.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.200
What if two or three people
bet correctly?

36:16.640 --> 36:18.960
It's improbable, but possible.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.160
That's how it goes.
Some win, many lose.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.560
We need quantity and time.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.240
I don't have time.
- Then you need quantity.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.720
It's simple:
more streakers, more money.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.720
The longer they're out there,

36:33.880 --> 36:36.320
the less people will bet correctly.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.920
"... like the scent of violets.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.040
Like the yearning of love's lament..."

36:43.000 --> 36:45.760
"it roams..." Thanks. Sit down.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.760
Annina, continue.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.720
"It is the song of..."

36:54.400 --> 36:57.440
"It is the song of peace among men..."

36:58.480 --> 37:01.720
I thought we had a deal.
Pick him up!

37:10.320 --> 37:13.280
It'll be healed in a few weeks.

37:14.320 --> 37:18.000
In a few weeks.
- It was worth it.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.760
Man, I overcame an obstacle

37:22.080 --> 37:23.880
and won self-confidence.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.880
It was so awesome!

37:26.240 --> 37:28.320
I'm so awesome!

37:35.720 --> 37:38.040
Excuse me. Is this

37:38.200 --> 37:40.200
"Overcome Obstacles,
Win Self-Confidence"?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.640
Yes.
- Thanks.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.040
My name is Strapinski.
Wenzel Strapinski.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.680
I'm glad you felt compelled
to answer my ad.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.000
Here you will learn
to overcome obstacles

37:54.160 --> 37:56.480
and win self-confidence.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.600
After intensive personal training

37:59.760 --> 38:02.520
you will each give
an unforgettable show

38:02.680 --> 38:05.360
in front of a large live audience.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.080
My method is somewhat unconventional...

38:13.600 --> 38:15.400
What a bastard!

38:16.080 --> 38:17.560
No, thanks!

38:23.960 --> 38:25.800
It's nice you've stayed.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.480
It was his first streak.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.880
Must've been
the pressure of unemployment.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.600
Something's not right.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
Striver.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.680
Fredy, rewind it a little.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.560
I'm Franz. That's Fredy.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.280
Sorry, Franz. Rewind a bit.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.280
Stop. Now play.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.360
Stop.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.520
Zoom in.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.240
There.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.360
An accomplice?

39:11.800 --> 39:13.280
Maybe.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I'll look into it.

39:17.080 --> 39:20.480
Hi, I'm René Strunz
from Bergisch Gladbach.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.440
I work at Quality-Pet.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.880
Monique la Fleure,
self-employed,

39:26.040 --> 39:28.120
and open for anything.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.920
Gabriel Grünthaler, 36, single.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.920
Should I undress?
- Not yet.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.680
I don't mind.
- No.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.680
Marwan al'Sharaa,
I have 30 years

39:41.360 --> 39:44.080
and no work permit.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.640
No problem.
Welcome to Switzerland.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.280
My therapist said

39:52.440 --> 39:55.120
I should come out of my shell more.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.760
Thanks.

39:58.280 --> 40:02.040
You will each make
just a few appearances.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.760
What if we get caught?
- Good question.

40:07.960 --> 40:10.240
The first three times
they won't do much

40:10.400 --> 40:13.280
if you have an excuse
like a bachelor party,

40:13.440 --> 40:17.240
alcohol, you lost a bet
or trouble at work.

40:17.560 --> 40:21.200
Excuse me.
My language not good.

40:21.960 --> 40:24.000
What we doing here?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.920
You'll see in a second.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.120
On your mark, go.

40:35.920 --> 40:40.040
This is 40 degrees
and this is 75 degrees.

40:53.280 --> 40:57.240
It's time to learn
to let go of inhibitions.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.880
GRASS OFF LIMITS

41:15.440 --> 41:17.760
So, they're coming this way.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.360
And he comes from behind?

41:28.240 --> 41:30.240
Yes, clothes off.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.000
Yes, yes, yes!

41:36.680 --> 41:39.040
Kushtrim, I know when and where

41:39.360 --> 41:41.240
the next streaks will happen.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.480
Awesome!
- There will be several.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.760
Go, Aarau! Go, Aarau!

41:52.080 --> 41:53.600
Go, Aarau!

41:54.200 --> 41:56.280
Are you sure...

42:28.120 --> 42:29.720
Only 14 seconds.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.000
The next one's better.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.280
24 seconds.

43:11.720 --> 43:12.920
Good.

43:14.040 --> 43:17.200
Come on, the next one's in Biel.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.200
Sure, you can take your people

43:21.520 --> 43:23.480
and your equipment and leave,

43:23.800 --> 43:27.440
sue me or break all my bones...

43:27.600 --> 43:31.040
But on the other hand
you're a businessman,

43:31.920 --> 43:35.320
and there are 82,000 francs in there,

43:35.480 --> 43:36.960
plus 10% for you.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.160
The choice is yours.

44:04.360 --> 44:08.200
And suddenly
I had a very different job.

44:08.400 --> 44:12.320
A job...
How can I say this modestly?

44:13.000 --> 44:16.520
A job I had a certain talent for.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.560
So, what's this?

46:12.880 --> 46:16.000
If he comes this way,
you're in trouble.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.000
STREAKING!
THE NEW SPORTS TREND?

46:53.640 --> 46:56.440
This streaking epidemic is intolerable!

46:56.760 --> 46:59.000
They're making us look like asses!

46:59.160 --> 47:00.960
Yes, with their asses.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.560
I summoned a special unit

47:03.720 --> 47:05.880
to put an end to these nut jobs.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.440
Ms Sandra Strebel leads the unit.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.480
She's a distinguished commissar.
Go ahead.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.520
Thanks, Mr President.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.160
Hello, Ladies and...

47:19.080 --> 47:20.120
Gentlemen.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.240
This is, most likely,

47:22.400 --> 47:26.080
the work of an organized gang.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.440
Several clues point to that,

47:28.600 --> 47:31.440
and I've identified a signature.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.480
The signature of a kind of mastermind

47:34.800 --> 47:37.160
behind the whole thing.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.760
I must find that mastermind

47:39.920 --> 47:41.760
and bring him to justice.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.360
Hello.
- You're never home anymore.

47:48.480 --> 47:51.600
Did you meet someone?
- No.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.240
I have more important things to do.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.440
Like what?

48:01.320 --> 48:03.520
Well, your father...

48:07.440 --> 48:09.720
I'm teaching a kind of course.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.920
Wow. Super exciting.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.920
He's dangerous.
You've got a radius.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.360
Every stadium
has its plusses and minuses.

48:37.680 --> 48:41.480
Letzigrund Stadium
has this athletics track.

48:41.800 --> 48:45.400
That influences your gear
and streak angle.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.360
Standard model Hercules,
4 feet high.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.800
Here are two mammoth models.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.320
STOP STREAKING!

50:28.960 --> 50:31.480
He's our best man.
Got an IQ of 138.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.880
Hits the target at any range.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.920
Black belt in Karate.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.160
Dan rank five.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.720
Tip-top.
I've got a mission for him.

50:59.520 --> 51:02.440
Of course. What's it about?

51:02.800 --> 51:04.800
Sorry, it's top secret.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.640
That's what I thought.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.080
Stop. This is interesting.

51:12.400 --> 51:16.680
This security guard
approached at 35 degrees,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.400
and this one at 120 degrees.

51:19.720 --> 51:22.640
The best evasive route isn't this way.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.720
It's where you'd least expect it to be.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.400
This isn't just any streaker.

51:30.560 --> 51:34.120
Leandro de la Cruz
set the world record

51:34.280 --> 51:36.040
in 1997.

51:36.200 --> 51:39.880
He was on the field
3 minutes and 18 seconds

51:40.200 --> 51:41.960
before they caught him.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.440
Watch, marvel and learn.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.800
Strapinski.
- This is Monique.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.440
You said to call if something's up.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.120
Two of my clients...
- Fredy.

51:59.280 --> 52:02.480
Pass the shampoo?
- Sure Franz.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.960
They're cops!

52:04.280 --> 52:06.840
You won't believe what I heard.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.680
Three times the budget.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.960
Three times the security.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.480
And a special unit just to stop us.

52:25.040 --> 52:27.040
What does it all mean?

52:28.760 --> 52:30.320
War.

52:30.760 --> 52:34.440
Thank you for coming by.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.760
We need to talk
about Annina's performance.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.200
Of course.
It's just a bit of a shock.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.240
She's never had problems.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.800
She's sad if there's no homework.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.320
It's not about homework.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.880
It's about her behavior in class.

52:53.520 --> 52:55.040
Oh?

52:55.960 --> 52:57.880
She's behaving...

52:58.480 --> 53:00.000
... differently.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.520
She disrupts class.
- That's not true!

53:04.160 --> 53:05.280
And lies.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
Honey, go outside for a sec.

53:10.640 --> 53:13.640
It's better if I talk to Mr Näf alone.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.600
What's wrong all the sudden?

53:24.920 --> 53:28.000
Do you have stress
at home or at work?

53:28.520 --> 53:29.920
No.

53:30.720 --> 53:34.440
Have you taken on
any new responsibilities?

53:35.120 --> 53:37.440
I'm the head of a special unit

53:37.600 --> 53:39.200
to catch streakers.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.320
But with Annina...

53:44.280 --> 53:46.760
A special unit for streakers?

53:47.560 --> 53:51.480
Isn't that going overboard?
- Not at all.

53:52.120 --> 53:55.400
We're talking about an organized gang

53:55.720 --> 53:58.480
lead by a certain Strapinski.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.400
Interesting theory.

54:01.320 --> 54:04.200
How do you plan
to stop the streakers?

54:04.360 --> 54:07.960
That must be difficult.
- Yes, it is.

54:08.440 --> 54:12.320
But I think
I've discovered a simple pattern.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.600
Just imagine this is the playing field.

54:17.160 --> 54:19.160
And this is the streaker.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.960
Stop! Stop!

54:21.520 --> 54:23.280
Change of plans.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.600
The police know everything!

54:27.040 --> 54:30.120
Three, two, one, kick-off in Thun.

54:30.280 --> 54:33.400
Keep me informed.
St. Gallen?

54:33.560 --> 54:36.200
We're in the 34th minute.
All is quiet.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.320
Good. Basel?
- Here, too.

54:38.480 --> 54:41.560
88th minute, Basel is in the lead.
- Thanks.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.960
Stick to important information.
- Roger.

55:04.560 --> 55:07.360
It looks good. They don't dare.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.280
Basel here.
Possible streaker from section A3.

55:17.600 --> 55:18.920
Shit!

55:19.440 --> 55:22.760
Let me guess:
lost bet, bachelor night

55:23.080 --> 55:24.520
or problems at work.

55:24.840 --> 55:27.240
I know all the excuses.

55:27.720 --> 55:31.360
We know you belong to a streaker gang.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.480
... Catch the tiger by the toe.

55:34.640 --> 55:37.080
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo

55:37.360 --> 55:39.800
and you are out!

55:41.400 --> 55:44.200
What's with him?
- Blood alcohol: 2.0.

55:44.360 --> 55:48.440
It's his excuse.
- But he was sober before.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.800
Sorry, do we know each other?

56:03.480 --> 56:05.720
You're an actor.
- No.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.160
But I've been on TV before.

56:11.880 --> 56:15.360
The streaker, right?
- You saw that?

56:15.680 --> 56:18.440
Of course!
You were incredible!

56:18.760 --> 56:21.160
Awesome.
- I'm a huge fan.

56:21.320 --> 56:24.120
Thanks.
- Excuse me. A beer for my buddy.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.800
It's on me. Cheers.
- Cheers.

56:26.960 --> 56:29.840
What a coincidence.
I don't believe it.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.680
Tada! Our training center.

56:53.760 --> 56:55.800
I recruited somebody.

56:56.520 --> 56:58.400
You can't just bring him here.

56:58.560 --> 57:00.520
Without a background check.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.680
You can trust Andreas 100%.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.760
We've really old friends.
- It's an honor.

57:11.800 --> 57:14.320
We have to be very careful.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.920
No problem, Mr Strapinski.

57:28.480 --> 57:31.480
Hello.
I'd like to speak to Mr Strebel.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.960
Ah, Mr Näf. Sure.

57:34.120 --> 57:36.960
We've been expecting you.
Come with me.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.600
Here you go.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.320
Thanks.

58:03.320 --> 58:07.600
Hello, Mr Näf.
- I'm glad you had time.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.480
Thanks for coming
all the way to Zurich.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.000
Especially on the weekend.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.240
Take a seat.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.640
Thanks.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.080
Is this about my daughter again?
- Yes.

58:25.880 --> 58:29.200
Annina...
- Stop. Before you start ranting,

58:29.960 --> 58:33.080
I've been thinking about a few things.

58:33.760 --> 58:37.480
Last time we talked about my work.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.200
I wondered why.

58:39.360 --> 58:43.520
Why is a teacher
interested in my work?

58:44.480 --> 58:48.720
After your second call, it hit me.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.520
I'm sorry.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.280
So you figured it out.
- Yes.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.160
Yes...
- You've got a crush on me.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.560
But that's not forbidden.

59:10.400 --> 59:13.760
Most men are cowards nowadays.

59:14.080 --> 59:17.680
It's great you took this step.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.920
I don't like cowards.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.040
Annina's dad
was my boyfriend for 8 years.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.000
He didn't have the courage

59:27.480 --> 59:29.640
to marry me or to leave me.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.680
He didn't leave till I got pregnant.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.800
I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.560
I just want to say:

59:41.040 --> 59:44.160
Sometimes you have to be brave.

59:48.920 --> 59:50.440
To bravery.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.520
To bravery.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.560
Have you been
up the Großmunster lately?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.400
Not for ages.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.920
Have you been
to the lake lately?

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.080
Not for ages.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.680
Have you rented a boat lately?

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.600
Annina?
- At a friend's house.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.880
I'll do it. It's a sports bra.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.440
Oh, shit!
- Oh, no.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Sorry.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.400
Go on, you were undressing.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.520
MISSION COMPLETE. STRAPINSKI = BALTASAR NÄF

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.560
NEED MORE TIME. I'LL REPORT LATER.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.720
I've got to go.
You can stay in bed.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.960
NEED MORE TIME. I'LL REPORT LATER.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.760
Bad news?

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.200
It's just work.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It was really nice.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.160
Mr Näf?

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.800
I thought you were at a friend's.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.680
She went to the movies
with someone else.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.280
Well, did you do your homework?
- Yes.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.240
Mr Näf?
Was it by the book?

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.360
You're walking funny.
Sore muscles?

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.000
Watch out, Mr Näf.
The cops are coming.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.360
He knows all about that.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.240
That's enough.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.320
Now an excerpt from
Clothes Make the Man:

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.920
"Strapinski smiled a sickly smile..."

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.040
"Strapinski smiled a sickly smile..."

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.760
So, you want to streak with us?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.800
Yes, very much so.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.640
Okay, then undress.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.640
Okay, now do the propeller.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.600
The what?

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.320
The propeller. You know.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.920
Okay, now turn your body.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.080
Stay like that.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.840
Don't stop. Faster.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.040
A little more to the left.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.880
Turn it the other way. Faster.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.360
Okay,
I see you've definitely got talent.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.960
I've got a special mission for you.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.520
Here.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.720
An international mission.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.800
The Cup semi-final is about to begin:

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.800
Zurich vs. Bern.
It's an exciting match.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
Who will make the final?

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.360
And will a streaker
make it onto the field

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.800
again today?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.240
One team is out to stop them:

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.960
the security team
from Letzigrund Stadium.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.760
We've worked on
anticipating the streakers.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.880
Identifying streakers immediately is key,

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.560
and the legwork.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.600
STRAPINSKI WANTS ME
TO STREAK IN COLUMBIA.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.320
WHAT DO I DO?

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.480
DO IT! IMPORTANT!

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.600
More security.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.880
Yes. I was expecting them.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.440
Did we get a lot of bets?
- Yes, too many.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.160
We could lose a lot of cash.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.080
When will I get 140,000?

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.440
140,000? That's tough.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.800
He's got to survive for 52 seconds.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.280
Okay.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.280
If he does, I'm out.
- Out?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.800
Yes, then I can pay off
the sports field.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.399
Out? Out?
What about the Keller museum?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.240
I met somebody who's

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.640
more important to me than he is.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:26.760
Okay.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.120
Deal.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.800
It's getting too risky for me anyway.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.279
Their defense is like a wall.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:34.960
Speaking of defense,

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.359
there are no streakers in sight.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.640
We're coming to the end
of the first half.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.680
A nice pass to the center.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.399
And still no suspicious people in sight.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.000
Fuck!

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.840
Eleven seconds. Sorry.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.560
You saw it yourself.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.359
Not one but two streakers today,
Mr Gress.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.680
That surprised me, but it proves

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.760
that streaking is an evolving sport.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.359
It's not like back in your day.
- No.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.720
It wasn't modern soccer,
but we were dressed.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.960
This has to stop right now!

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.520
They're dicking us around!

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.920
Yes, with their dicks.
- Ms Strebel.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.880
We agree.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.040
We've got a top agent

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.200
working undercover in the gang.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.000
A very exceptional agent.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.560
It's only a matter of time.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.760
Where is that game?
- In Columbia.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.040
It's a Categoria Primera game.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.240
Their problems are similar to ours.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.160
Ms Strebel, please go on.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.200
We'll get Strapinski soon.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.800
Then I'll show him!

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.880
Take care.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.560
Okay, bye.
- Great.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.280
I'll be right back.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.160
Fuck.
- Wow!

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.840
It's sucks.
They're betting for security.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.360
Nobody believes

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.160
anyone can do it.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.760
That's even better.
- No!

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.640
How do we pay them if they win?

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.560
Some of them
don't have a sense of humor.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.880
We'll cancel it.
- No, we won't.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.400
Don't worry so much. It'll work.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.280
I'll send in my best people.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.200
What's the extra cash for?
- It's a surprise.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.120
I hate surprises.
- It's not for you.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.800
We inscribed it like you requested.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.360
Perfect.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.880
Would you like to have a box?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.560
No, that's not necessary.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.920
You'll get the last 110,000 on Monday.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.600
Then it's paid for.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.760
Plus your 10 percent.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.640
But if you don't pay on Monday...

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.520
Yes, I know.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.160
Then you'll break all my bones.
- Exactly.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.720
Fredy, look into the construction site.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.520
Sure.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.360
The Cup Final will also be our final.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.320
Our crucial, final appearance.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.080
There will be victims.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.040
Some of you won't make it.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.160
But we will succeed as a team!

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.040
Franz, get our best surveillance team.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.680
Understood.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.960
Your mother.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.480
You need to be on the left at halftime,

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.880
near the locker rooms.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.600
Okay.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.640
In Sector A,

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.480
you're seat 23,
in the second row.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.600
You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.720
I've got a surprise for you.
- Me too.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.320
Look, I made them just for you.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.160
Try one.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.720
Thanks.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.360
You coming?
I want to show you something.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.280
I see. In the bedroom.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.240
Lie down on the bed.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.680
Now close your eyes.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.880
Oh boy!
- You're Strapinski!

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.960
You lied to me, faked everything!

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.720
I wasn't faking. My feelings...

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.480
What you say now
can be used against you.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.800
I love you.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.640
"I love you."

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.200
Any other lies?
- Yes, I am Strapinski.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.600
I couldn't tell you!
We have to do this one!

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.920
The site manager wants his money!

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.040
The salon clients will make trouble!

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.720
Let me go.
It's a life and death matter!

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.920
"... Life and...

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.080
Death."
I can't do that.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.160
You can watch your team from here.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.400
The Final is about to begin:
Baden vs. Bern.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.680
Enjoy.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.360
Fuck!

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.640
Annina, thank God.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.400
Do you have a saw for metal?

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.560
Yes, we do.
- Great! Go get it.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.440
I just forgot this.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.520
No!

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.800
At least give me the phone!

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.920
No! They're not for you!

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.960
No!

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.880
Hello.
- Cheers.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.560
But Baden has proved

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.520
that they can beat the big boys, too.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.520
Thanks to Stiel in the goal.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.040
Stiel has seen better days.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.560
Mr Salzgeber,
the man is in peak form.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.720
You have no idea.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.880
Hey, guys.
- Hello, Annina.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.280
Look, I've got cookies.
- May I? Thanks.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.200
Want one?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.800
Dear spectators.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.320
On behalf of stadium security
and the police,

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.680
I'd like to inform you that, today,

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.640
we caught the streaker gang.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.080
Their leader is Baltasar Näf,

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.520
a teacher from Baden.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.800
His partner and accomplices

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.680
are being arrested
as I speak to you now.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.640
So, it looks like the end.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.720
The streakers will streak no more.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.760
Congratulations.
- The game lasts 90 minutes.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.400
The ball is round

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.720
and the streaker comes at the end.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.880
Enjoy the game.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.760
I take full responsibility.
- Fine.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.920
Was it something I said?

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.680
Hey, Mom.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.280
Want a cookie? They're amazing.
- No, thanks.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.960
Is that the best way to do it?
- Sure.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.280
We always do it this way.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.000
So, my situation is easy to explain.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.840
To save the sports field, I need to stay

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.840
out here
for one minute and 23 seconds.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.320
So wish me luck.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.680
Unbelievable!
It looks like

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.360
the streaker is Baltasar Näf,

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.840
the streaker gang leader!

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.040
69% angle... 110% angle...

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:54.240
He's doing well.
His strategy is excellent!

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.400
Näf! Näf!

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.200
Näf! Näf!

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.680
"Sometimes you have to be brave."

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.800
Wow!
He's been out there two minutes!

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.840
You thinking what I am?
- He might do it!

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.080
He might just break the world record

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.040
set in 1997 by Leandro de la Cruz!

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.920
Go, dad! You can do it!

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.640
Näf is your dad?
- Yes, of course.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.200
Go!

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.240
WORLD RECORD: 3:18

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.120
The whole stadium is with him,

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.040
but security is closing in!

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.680
WORLD RECORD: 3:18

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.000
Crazy!
- A world record for Switzerland!

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.080
It's unbelievable!

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.680
Way to go, Näf!

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.840
NEW WORLD RECORD!

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.280
You're the best, Dad!

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.480
I cuffed you a bit better this time.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.160
I'm sorry.
- There are worse things.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.720
Like a damage suit

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.440
for two million and six months prison.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.280
Although 30 minutes ago

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.520
a man in a white Lamborghini drove up.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.360
He paid the damages for you.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.840
So where
will you serve your sentence?

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.320
I found just the place
for you to do that.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.840
There was enough money
for the sports field

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.960
and for the Keller Museum.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.880
I was allowed
to serve my sentence there.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.560
Come closer so you can all see.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.600
This was Keller's living room furniture

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.360
where he relaxed

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.720
after a hard day's work.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.080
These were his slippers.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.560
He wore them
while he revised the 7th version

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.840
of The People of Seldwyla.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.680
We're closed for today.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.000
We're closed.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.480
Have a safe trip home.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.200
Want me to help tomorrow too?
- Sure.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520
Cool.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.960
CLOSED

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.640
I'm sorry.
We can't leave you unsupervised.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.560
No?

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.800
No.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.040
It's way too dangerous.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.960
Then you'd better sleep over.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.840
Exactly.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.720
