00:53.387 --> 00:57.725
<i>I was born</i>
<i>in 1962 at Coral Gables Hospital,</i>

00:57.808 --> 01:01.812
<i>located on the University</i>
<i>of Miami campus.</i>

01:01.896 --> 01:04.940
<i>My parents like to brag</i>
<i>that their baby was so smart</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:08.736
<i>that she was already in college</i>
<i>the day she was born.</i>

01:08.819 --> 01:12.907
<i>I was given the name Cozy after</i>
<i>my father's favorite Jazz drummer-</i>

01:12.990 --> 01:14.909
<i>Cozy Cole.</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:17.453
<i>My mother left us when I was 10.</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:22.124
<i>My father always liked to say</i>
<i>that she ran away to join the circus.</i>

01:22.208 --> 01:26.504
<i>I like to think of her there in</i>
<i>a sequined cape flying through the air</i>

01:26.587 --> 01:29.590
<i>without a single net to catch her fall.</i>

01:29.673 --> 01:32.093
<i>Dad was never a religious man,</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:36.426
<i>but after Mom left,</i>
<i>he decided to raise me Catholic.</i>

01:36.555 --> 01:38.182
<i>On Sundays, I went to mass,</i>

01:38.265 --> 01:42.978
<i>and on the first Wednesday of every
month, I was sent to confession.</i>

01:43.062 --> 01:47.108
<i>Since I could never bring myself</i>
<i>to confess any of my real sins,</i>

01:47.191 --> 01:51.858
<i>I kept four made-up sins</i>
<i>that I used over and over again.</i>

01:52.822 --> 01:54.824
<i>Though Bobby and I</i>
<i>had never touched,</i>

01:54.907 --> 01:57.827
<i>he wrote me poems</i>
<i>all through high school.</i>

01:57.910 --> 02:01.664
<i>Later, I accepted his proposal</i>
<i>for marriage.</i>

02:01.747 --> 02:07.997
<i>I knew Bobby loved me and figured someday
I'd probably grow to love him too.</i>

02:08.795 --> 02:12.258
<i>We purchased our new home</i>
<i>through a city auction.</i>

02:12.341 --> 02:16.971
<i>The previous owner had murdered her husband
and buried him inside the shower wall.</i>

02:17.054 --> 02:20.182
<i>Bobby said</i>
<i>aside from being affordable,</i>

02:20.266 --> 02:23.933
<i>the house was also</i>
<i>a good conversation piece.</i>

02:26.939 --> 02:32.277
<i>I often thought about this woman and
wondered what made her act so violently.</i>

02:32.361 --> 02:34.196
<i>I guess it wasn't any one big thing,</i>

02:34.280 --> 02:40.447
<i>but a lot of little things that just grew</i>
<i>deeper and deeper under her skin.</i>

04:07.706 --> 04:09.500
Freeze! Police!

04:43.075 --> 04:47.997
<i>Most tourists visit the Miami area
for its beaches on the east coast,</i>

04:48.080 --> 04:53.377
<i>but if you ever mistakenly got on the
Palmetto Expressway and headed west,</i>

04:53.460 --> 04:56.880
<i>you'd run right into</i>
<i>the Florida Everglades,</i>

04:56.964 --> 05:01.343
<i>an area that Indians</i>
<i>like to call "the River of Grass."</i>

05:01.427 --> 05:04.638
<i>People used to think this area</i>
<i>was uninhabitable</i>

05:04.722 --> 05:07.474
<i>but more and more</i>
<i>it's becoming civilized,</i>

05:07.558 --> 05:09.518
<i>and they say that within two years</i>

05:09.601 --> 05:13.435
<i>there will be a shopping center</i>
<i>every 15 miles.</i>

05:27.411 --> 05:28.954
Thanks.

05:57.608 --> 06:01.862
<i>I've heard it said that the mother-child</i>
<i>bond begins at birth.</i>

06:01.945 --> 06:03.530
<i>For me, this Never occurred.</i>

06:03.614 --> 06:07.368
<i>And on some days,</i>
<i>I'd sit at my window for hours</i>

06:07.451 --> 06:13.873
<i>just waiting for a nice couple in a big station
wagon to come and take these kids away.</i>

06:13.957 --> 06:16.460
<i>Too much daydreaming left me blue.</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:19.421
<i>So while Bobby worked day and night,</i>

06:19.505 --> 06:23.755
<i>I stayed home and tried</i>
<i>to make the best of my time.</i>

06:47.658 --> 06:50.494
This guy's sitting at the bar
like a dead fish not talking to anyone,

06:50.577 --> 06:53.414
when this redhead comes up
and takes a seat next to him.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.416
They strike up a conversation.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.419
Eventually,
the conversation turns to sex.

06:58.502 --> 07:02.089
She says, "Great. I like kinky sex too.
Let's go to my place."

07:02.172 --> 07:04.172
So they go to her place.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.677
He goes in the bathroom.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.471
She takes off all of her clothes
and gets under the covers.

07:09.555 --> 07:13.559
After a couple of minutes, he comes out of
the bathroom. He's straightening his tie.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.519
He says- She says,
"Hey, where you going?"

07:15.602 --> 07:19.936
He says, "I'm through.
I already shit in your purse."

07:20.899 --> 07:23.026
Freeze! Police!

07:54.975 --> 07:56.810
Well, that's the best one I know.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.978
If that doesn't help,
I can only offer more booze.

08:04.485 --> 08:08.530
<i>It's funny how</i>
<i>a single day could drag and drag</i>

08:08.614 --> 08:12.114
<i>while entire years</i>
<i>just flip by in a flash.</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:17.164
<i>Once I calculated</i>
<i>how many hours old I was</i>

08:17.247 --> 08:21.501
<i>and then estimated how many</i>
<i>more hours there were to go.</i>

08:21.585 --> 08:23.086
<i>On another day,</i>

08:23.170 --> 08:26.757
<i>I made a list of every person</i>
<i>I had ever known.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:29.218
<i>I wondered if any of these people</i>
<i>knew each other</i>

08:29.301 --> 08:32.888
<i>and if there was any chance</i>
<i>that they were all together now</i>

08:32.971 --> 08:36.308
<i>having a party or swimming in a pool.</i>

08:36.390 --> 08:42.313
<i>Then I wondered if there was any other
person on this planet as lonely as me.</i>

08:42.397 --> 08:47.814
<i>As it turned out, there was,</i>
<i>and he was living just a county away.</i>

09:26.817 --> 09:28.860
8:00, Lee.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.358
First thing this morning, right,
my dad's out on a run.

10:49.441 --> 10:53.153
So I'm just, like,
hanging out, having a cigarette,

10:53.236 --> 10:56.323
and I notice something on the end
of the road there, you know.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.533
I couldn't really make out what it was.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.662
From here, it looked like a gun.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.873
So we go over to check it out.

11:04.956 --> 11:09.920
Sure enough there it is- a fucking gun
laying right at the edge of the street.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.840
What, like a real gun?
Yes, like a very real gun.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.844
I got it hidden in the back there
in some boxes. It makes me nervous.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.513
Well, what kind of gun?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.641
I don't know.
It's black with a brown handle.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.726
Do you know anything about guns?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.229
Doug,
you coming to work today?

11:27.312 --> 11:30.148
Look, you gonna be around later?
I'll bring it on by.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.025
Julie giving you the night out?

11:32.109 --> 11:34.695
Working a little late.
You gonna be around or-

11:34.778 --> 11:36.154
Yeah, I'm around.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.488
Shoot up the neighborhood.
Sure, Dougie.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.552
You sick or something?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.429
Hi, Dad.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.557
Oh, you smell like a bottle of gin.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.308
I'm doing a little undercover work,

12:05.392 --> 12:10.647
and just so happens this guy I'm
tailing likes to spend his life in a bar.

12:10.731 --> 12:14.276
<i>There seems to be</i>
<i>no telling which way a life will go.</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:19.406
<i>In his younger days, my father played drums
in after-hours clubs all around Miami.</i>

12:19.489 --> 12:21.825
<i>A few times he even played New York.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:24.244
<i>But when my mother</i>
<i>became pregnant with me,</i>

12:24.327 --> 12:29.458
<i>he gave it all up and settled into a
steady job as a crime scene detective.</i>

12:29.541 --> 12:32.002
<i>He said that the law was a straight line</i>

12:32.085 --> 12:37.002
<i>and that no man could stand firmly</i>
<i>with a foot on each side.</i>

12:55.066 --> 12:58.945
Yeah. Ned Bishop.
Fucking guy shot my fish.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.530
I asked the guy for a net.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.450
Next thing, he's firing
his fucking UZI into the water.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.286
Blew a hole like this
right through my fish.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.079
Who goes fishing without a net?

13:08.163 --> 13:10.957
Men, I'd like you to meet my wife.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.959
- This is Mary.
- Hello.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.756
I hate to bust up the little party
you gentlemen have going here,

13:17.839 --> 13:20.801
but I came to see you, Ryder.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.553
So rather than have you drag
yourself out in the daylight,

13:23.637 --> 13:26.056
I figured I'd grab you here tonight.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.889
So if you don't mind.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.718
An officer doesn't just lose his gun

14:03.802 --> 14:06.346
any more than
he just looses his hand.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.849
His weapon
is an extension of his body.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.725
Now I may be a little
idealistic here, Ryder,

14:10.809 --> 14:14.688
but I'd like to think that an officer,
if he did lose his gun-

14:14.771 --> 14:18.316
an officer, that is, who's been in the
department for some 30-odd years-

14:18.400 --> 14:22.237
that he might, just might
have a small sliver of recall

14:22.320 --> 14:24.737
as to the where and the when.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.285
I'm putting you on
a week's suspension, Ryder.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.872
A detective from the internal affairs will
be assigned to investigate the situation.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.455
I think I can find my own gun.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.909
Man, I could shoot my way
right out of here.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.620
Come on, Lee, they're not
exactly holding you hostage.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.246
No kidding.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.666
My grandmother keeps running in and
out of here with her tape measure.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.250
She's gonna give you the boot?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.257
I've been in this room my whole life.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.552
Yeah, and you've hated it
your whole life.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.430
You know, you're gonna be 30
in a few months.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.183
Maybe, you know,
you should go out of here.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
Do a little traveling, see the world.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.354
Maybe even join the service.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.649
The service?
Fuck the service, man.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.527
I hate flying.
I hate camping. I hate jumping.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.363
They don't make you fly.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.449
Oh, yeah? You ever heard
of anybody driving off to war?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.953
See the world.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.497
I don't see you
seeing the world, Dougie.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.960
I see you working at your father's shop
till you drop dead from the fumes.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.464
Well, maybe that's the sad truth.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.692
Look, now you got me all depressed.
I'm gonna go.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.532
See you later.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.085
Hey, I forgot the gun.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.175
You know, I don't even know
what I should do with this thing.

16:49.259 --> 16:54.347
I mean, I can't keep it at the apartment.
Guns just flip Julie out.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.433
Julie.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.435
Why don't you go out there
and sell it to my mom?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.187
Come on. Seriously.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.692
I don't know, you could sell it in one
of those bars out in Broward County.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.359
Broward?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.319
I can't go to Broward.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.154
I'm out of my element in Broward.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.872
I'll see you later.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.804
Hey, Lee.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.807
Maybe you want to try selling it?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.733
8:00, Lee.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.069
Get the fuck out of here!

18:22.519 --> 18:24.270
Morning, Cozy.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.147
Hey, J.C.

18:26.231 --> 18:32.278
Looks like you're dropping a new pup
every time the wind changes direction.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.988
How's Shelley doing?

18:34.072 --> 18:37.784
She's good. Been seeing some boy
from over at the junior college.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.911
<i>You see them everywhere you look.</i>

18:39.994 --> 18:42.914
<i>And I don't know why</i>
<i>I never thought of it before,</i>

18:42.997 --> 18:45.416
<i>but one day I just started wondering-</i>

18:45.500 --> 18:47.961
<i>where are all</i>
<i>those highways heading?</i>

18:48.044 --> 18:51.131
That new captain, he just
doesn't understand your dad.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.843
They got off on the wrong foot when Ortiz told
him he couldn't bring animals into the, uh-

18:54.926 --> 18:56.719
into the office anymore.

18:56.803 --> 19:02.308
<i>Most people don't stop to consider that four
out of five murder victims are pet owners.</i>

19:02.392 --> 19:06.980
Your dad can't seem to manage leaving
the scene without those animals.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.108
Ortiz gets on board
and lays down the "no pets" law.

19:10.191 --> 19:16.108
Your dad took it real hard and things
haven't been going smoothly since.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.617
Hey, looks like they're
gonna finish the highway yet.

19:19.701 --> 19:24.122
Pretty looking with all the, uh,
tar all new and sparkly like that.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.375
I better get these babies
home before they burn up.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.585
Good enough.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.255
You be careful driving now.

19:58.948 --> 20:04.448
I don't know how you manage
working all night and sleeping all day.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.833
I have a horrible time
sleeping during the day.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.669
Well, after 30 years or so,
you get use to it.

20:11.753 --> 20:15.089
Well, I'd never get used to it.

20:16.341 --> 20:20.345
Not that I wouldn't enjoy
a little catnap.

20:32.148 --> 20:36.069
<i>They say that</i>
<i>the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</i>

20:36.152 --> 20:38.738
<i>I found this puzzling</i>
<i>and couldn't stop wondering-</i>

20:38.821 --> 20:42.033
<i>are our lives all mapped out for us?</i>

20:42.116 --> 20:45.912
<i>Would my daughter grow up</i>
<i>only to wear my shoes?</i>

20:45.995 --> 20:49.666
<i>Did my mother's life</i>
<i>create my destiny,</i>

20:49.749 --> 20:52.293
<i>or does one thing just trigger another?</i>

20:52.377 --> 20:54.211
What's with the locks?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.675
Hey, what's with the locks?

21:04.889 --> 21:07.850
Grandma, all my stuff's in there!

21:14.440 --> 21:17.068
Grandma, open the fucking door!

25:12.094 --> 25:16.307
Uh, you driving that blue
Malibu out there? Why?

25:16.390 --> 25:20.019
Well, you almost just ran me
over a minute ago. That was you?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.605
Yeah.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.366
So can I buy you a drink,

25:33.449 --> 25:36.327
seeing as how I almost
ran you over and everything?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.955
Okay. Yeah.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.288
What are you drinking?
How about a beer?

25:51.759 --> 25:53.636
I'm Lee. I'm sorry about tonight.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.138
Cozy.
What?

25:57.348 --> 25:59.100
I'm Cozy.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.143
Yeah, it's nice in here.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.229
No, I mean that's my name.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.022
It is not.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.692
Your mother give you that name?

26:07.775 --> 26:09.775
Cozy. It's a funny name.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.079
You meeting somebody
here tonight, Cozy?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.873
No, I just had the urge to get out.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.751
Yeah. I had the urge to drink.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.173
So, it's fate.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.527
So what were you doing
out in that pasture anyway?

26:51.611 --> 26:54.111
Just taking a little shortcut.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.618
Not afraid of some old bull
chasing after you?

26:58.701 --> 27:02.371
No. The cow in that pasture
died during the last rain.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.123
Oh.

27:04.206 --> 27:07.126
Yeah, I guess cows
aren't really built for swimming.

27:07.209 --> 27:11.126
No, it didn't drown.
It got struck by lightning.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.301
That would be a bad way to go.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.218
Well, I could think of worse ways.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.598
Really?

27:23.559 --> 27:26.812
You're not from around here,
are you?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.648
Nope.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.400
I'm from Dade.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.529
Actually, I was from Dade.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.866
I'm kind of in limbo right now.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.994
Limbo. That sounds nice.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.676
This I found...

27:56.759 --> 27:58.260
in a waiting room.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.346
It's good luck.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.183
Mom.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.977
That's fucking George.

28:08.688 --> 28:12.191
That's a picture of my pride and joy.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.567
And this...

28:15.027 --> 28:18.361
that's all that's left of my white Nova.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.243
Are you trying to impress me?

28:22.326 --> 28:26.330
Is it working? Well,
what else you got?

28:32.753 --> 28:34.714
Mom?

28:34.797 --> 28:38.634
But we already have mom here.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.913
Hey, Cozy?
Yeah, I got to get going.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.582
Hey, you feel like going for a swim?

29:09.665 --> 29:11.917
I got a friend with a pool.
He lets me use it whenever I want.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.129
No, I can't. I got to go home.
Come on. It's Friday night.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.922
I'd drive you back home afterwards.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.425
Or back to that cow pasture
you crawled out of.

29:19.508 --> 29:23.508
I just can't. Come on. Not
even for half an hour?

29:43.032 --> 29:45.743
That's good.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.033
Nobody broke in here.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.703
She got dressed up and went out.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.538
You two have a fight?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.456
Yeah, I guess.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.084
More like an argument really.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.587
She take a suitcase?

31:19.670 --> 31:22.798
No, she didn't take her suitcase.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.223
What's the gun for?

31:31.307 --> 31:33.100
Belongs to a friend of mine.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.561
You kill anybody with it?

31:35.644 --> 31:37.980
No.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.940
I killed my dog.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.859
You shot your dog?

31:41.942 --> 31:44.737
No, he got run over.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.156
And you were driving?

31:48.407 --> 31:52.161
No, but I'm the one who let him out.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.217
Oh, shit!

33:01.397 --> 33:03.232
Shit! Fuck!

33:03.315 --> 33:05.025
Goddamn it!

33:05.109 --> 33:08.153
I can't believe it. Shit!

33:22.084 --> 33:24.334
Do you think we killed him?

33:26.255 --> 33:28.173
Cozy.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.845
We should just get out of here.

33:32.928 --> 33:36.890
Hit the road,
maybe go up north somewhere.

33:36.974 --> 33:40.019
Just lay low till things blow over.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.080
<i>Did you ever wonder</i>
<i>what it would be like</i>

34:41.163 --> 34:44.333
<i>to be held up</i>
<i>in some motel somewhere,</i>

34:44.416 --> 34:47.418
<i>seeing your life played out on TV,</i>

34:47.503 --> 34:51.503
<i>knowing that the whole world</i>
<i>was looking for you?</i>

35:08.982 --> 35:14.066
You know, this place
is pretty creepy looking in the daylight.

35:19.368 --> 35:24.289
You don't by chance carry around
a toothbrush with you, do you?

35:24.373 --> 35:25.666
Oh, shit!

35:25.749 --> 35:28.293
There's a palmetto bug in there!
Don't let him come out!

35:28.377 --> 35:30.504
Well, give me something to smash it with.
Well, hold on.

35:30.587 --> 35:34.007
Shit! We don't even
have our shoes.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.219
Here!

35:38.762 --> 35:40.973
Ahh!
Did you get him?

35:41.056 --> 35:43.851
Give me another Bible.
Here! Here!

35:43.934 --> 35:44.852
Shoot it!

35:47.896 --> 35:50.816
I think I peed in my pants.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.359
Is it dead yet?

35:52.442 --> 35:56.859
I don't know. I shot the shit
out of the tiles though.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.750
Okay, okay. I'll be right out.

36:13.005 --> 36:16.672
They ought to give
my grandmother a job here.

36:17.926 --> 36:21.260
If you're staying, it's 20 more dollars.

36:30.898 --> 36:32.608
Uh-

36:37.112 --> 36:41.033
Uh, the thing is, uh- is 16 good?

36:41.116 --> 36:43.619
No, 20 is good.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.433
Bitch.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.849
Let's get out of here.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.946
<i>Lee and I had crossed</i>
<i>that straight line</i>

40:06.029 --> 40:07.823
<i>that Dad called the law,</i>

40:07.906 --> 40:09.991
<i>and I could feel the butterflies</i>
<i>in my stomach</i>

40:10.075 --> 40:13.328
<i>as I tumbled deeper</i>
<i>into a life of crime.</i>

40:13.412 --> 40:16.415
<i>After all, murder was thicker</i>
<i>than marriage,</i>

40:16.498 --> 40:20.498
<i>and Lee and I were now bound</i>
<i>by the life we took.</i>

40:21.461 --> 40:24.589
<i>Being a wanted man</i>
<i>made Lee restless,</i>

40:24.673 --> 40:29.594
<i>and he swore he'd never sleep soundly
until we were well out of Florida.</i>

40:29.678 --> 40:32.431
<i>So he stole</i>
<i>his mother's record collection</i>

40:32.514 --> 40:35.684
<i>figuring even if we only got</i>
<i>a dollar a record,</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:37.936
<i>we would still have enough money</i>
<i>to fill the tank</i>

40:38.019 --> 40:42.186
<i>and make Miami a mere speck</i>
<i>in our rearview mirror.</i>

41:14.723 --> 41:17.392
It was just like
I told the officer last night.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.144
I heard some voices and some rustlin'.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.688
I got my light. I came out back.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.482
I saw her sitting right over there,

41:23.565 --> 41:26.026
pointing a gun right at me.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.820
It was as if she
was there waiting for me.

41:28.904 --> 41:34.238
Did you get a look at the person
she was with? No, sir, I didn't.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.246
I'm driving.

42:46.982 --> 42:48.984
He's waitin'.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.694
Couple minutes go by.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.071
So she finally walks up,
and the guy's all dressed.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.739
She goes, "Hey, where you goin'?"

42:54.823 --> 42:56.849
"I already shit in your purse."
I've heard it.

42:56.933 --> 42:59.100
Oh, shit on you. Hey, man.

43:02.414 --> 43:06.914
You got some really nice-
This is real nice stuff here.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.965
You know, but basically,
I only deal in jazz, you know, so, uh-

43:12.048 --> 43:14.467
You ought to hang on to that stuff.

43:14.551 --> 43:17.262
Hey, arrest that guy. He walked out
in the middle of my sentence.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.147
Yeah? Which joke were you tellin'?

43:19.230 --> 43:24.564
Aw, youth today, man. Nothing's sacred.
Startin' to realize that.

43:26.021 --> 43:28.106
Blue Note.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.774
Yeah, right here.

43:30.859 --> 43:32.027
Ryder.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.948
Okay, we're on our way.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.533
Come on.
Okay.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.501
What if I'd been at home?

43:48.585 --> 43:50.754
Has he ever
gotten physical with you?

43:50.837 --> 43:52.380
Or his mother?

43:52.464 --> 43:56.384
Oh, he's never taken a strike at me,
but the language-

43:56.468 --> 44:00.388
The language he uses is just awful.

44:00.472 --> 44:02.223
That doesn't count.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.392
Well, it should.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.731
You dust this?
No, it's clean.

44:09.814 --> 44:13.443
Anyway, to-
to make a long story short,

44:13.526 --> 44:15.654
by 6:00 we're all eatin'
this barbecued goat,

44:15.737 --> 44:18.156
drinkin' beer and so forth.

44:18.239 --> 44:21.993
Things are goin' along nicely,
and Clark, he's being really low-key,

44:22.077 --> 44:24.204
which is a nice change of pace
for Clark.

44:24.287 --> 44:26.998
You familiar with any
of his high school teachers?

44:27.082 --> 44:29.501
Specifically a Mr. Humphrey.

44:29.584 --> 44:30.835
Tall black man?

44:30.919 --> 44:35.548
High school? He's almost 30
years old, for Christ's sake.

44:35.632 --> 44:39.719
You know, you don't seem
too surprised by all of this.

44:39.803 --> 44:42.597
Isn't this strange behavior
for your son?

44:42.681 --> 44:46.393
Well, he took my heels.
That was a bit strange.

44:46.476 --> 44:48.895
Oh, he's all mixed up.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.650
So all night long as, uh,
people finish eating,

44:53.733 --> 44:57.946
they're stacking their plates
of leftovers out near the truck.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.449
The odd thing is, the dog never seems
to be the slightest bit interested.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.911
He just stays under the truck
ignoring the food.

45:04.994 --> 45:08.790
Now, it's not the nature of a dog
to ignore food like that.

45:08.873 --> 45:12.711
Well, before long, Garret realizes
the dog isn't under the truck.

45:12.794 --> 45:15.922
J.C., is this really
the short version of the story?

45:16.005 --> 45:17.882
You get what I'm saying to you?

45:17.966 --> 45:19.759
That was no goddamn goat
we barbecued.

45:19.843 --> 45:21.677
That was Garret's dog.

45:22.470 --> 45:25.470
Clark, he's a- He's a fuckin' sicko.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.561
Some people say
it's like a disease, you know?

45:29.644 --> 45:33.981
Once you start,
you can't stop till you're all filled up.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.443
Spider's pretty much filled up.

45:36.526 --> 45:39.779
He's got this... cobra that starts

45:39.863 --> 45:41.948
way up on his shoulder.

45:42.031 --> 45:45.948
Kind of drapes down
and covers his entire chest.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.994
Used to be a tattoo of his wife.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.500
But if you look real close you can see

45:52.584 --> 45:56.334
how the cobra's head
was once the wife's face.

45:57.630 --> 46:00.216
See, he used the original eyes.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.634
The wife's eyes
are now the cobra's eyes.

46:05.764 --> 46:09.848
Spider always said his wife
was half snake anyway.

46:48.973 --> 46:52.393
I told you already.
He'll be back in a little while.

46:52.477 --> 46:55.146
He'll come to your office
and pay you then, all right?

46:55.230 --> 46:57.524
Well, I hope so.

47:32.684 --> 47:34.686
<i>Lee hadn't slept well in two nights</i>

47:34.769 --> 47:37.105
<i>on account of</i>
<i>we were still in Dade County</i>

47:37.188 --> 47:41.276
<i>in the very neighborhood</i>
<i>where we had shot a man dead.</i>

47:41.359 --> 47:45.822
<i>Since my purse and photo ID had</i>
<i>been left at the scene of the crime,</i>

47:45.905 --> 47:48.199
<i>Lee said</i>
<i>I should hang back at the motel</i>

47:48.283 --> 47:50.785
<i>and remain out of sight.</i>

47:50.869 --> 47:53.121
<i>Anyways,</i>
<i>I didn't know much about holdups</i>

47:53.204 --> 47:58.204
<i>and Lee didn't want me</i>
<i>gettin' in the way of his crime spree.</i>

49:02.482 --> 49:04.275
Hey!

49:04.359 --> 49:07.987
You know you breakin' the law, man,
comin' in here with your shoes off?

49:08.071 --> 49:10.490
There's a dress code in Dade County.

49:10.573 --> 49:16.240
Go ahead and get what the hell
you want and get the hell out of here.

49:54.867 --> 49:56.619
11.60, sir.

50:06.713 --> 50:08.589
11.60, sir.

50:10.258 --> 50:14.595
What's the matter with you?
You understand English? 1 1.60.

50:14.679 --> 50:17.263
Don't move. Get back. Get back!

50:24.147 --> 50:26.899
- Sucker. - Hey, man, you gotta
pay. Come back here. Hey!

50:26.983 --> 50:31.150
You owe me money!
Bring my fuckin' money back here!

51:00.308 --> 51:03.436
We used to go to
River Ranch's campgrounds

51:03.519 --> 51:05.897
two weekends out of every month.

51:05.980 --> 51:10.151
Those two weekends
could get really crazy.

51:10.234 --> 51:12.734
My mom could get pretty crazy.

51:14.072 --> 51:17.075
You know, she could out-drink
just about anybody, man or woman,

51:17.158 --> 51:19.325
regardless of body weight.

51:20.620 --> 51:25.249
I remember this one time my dad
came crashing into the camper.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.710
My mom hated anybody
quitting a party,

51:27.794 --> 51:29.754
and I could hear her outside yellin',

51:29.837 --> 51:33.841
"Jimmy, this is the devil. I want
you to come out and play with me."

51:33.925 --> 51:36.344
And my dad yelled out,
"And this is God,

51:36.427 --> 51:40.348
and if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna strike you dead."

51:40.431 --> 51:43.518
Well, that left just Carl and my mom.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.687
Carl ran the campgrounds.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.942
Anyways, the party broke up
kind of early the next morning

51:51.025 --> 51:54.362
when my dad threw all our junk
in the camper.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.529
I was still up in my bed.

51:58.324 --> 52:03.162
Just then he just slammed the camper
door and hopped in his truck,

52:03.246 --> 52:06.374
and- and drove off.

52:06.457 --> 52:09.544
I rode the whole way home
in the back of the camper,

52:09.627 --> 52:12.794
not even knowing
my mom wasn't with us.

52:23.891 --> 52:25.810
The spent bullet is marked.

52:25.893 --> 52:29.480
McGwire's the one that found the flaw
in Jimmy's gun in the first place.

52:29.564 --> 52:31.023
He coined it "the crapper,"

52:31.107 --> 52:33.985
and he's certain that the bullet
fired at Humphrey

52:34.068 --> 52:37.818
is the same bullet
that came from Ryder's gun.

52:45.163 --> 52:47.456
The way I see things,

52:47.540 --> 52:49.417
you used to have two problems-

52:49.500 --> 52:52.503
a missing daughter
and a missing gun.

52:53.337 --> 52:55.381
The way it looks now,

52:55.464 --> 52:58.131
they're really the same problem.

53:31.876 --> 53:36.797
Do you think there's some girl
standing in a motel room far away

53:36.881 --> 53:40.381
lookin' at a picture
and thinking about me?

53:42.053 --> 53:43.554
I doubt it.

53:47.642 --> 53:49.894
She finds men to marry her.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.190
Recently she's been
in a bit of a slump,

53:54.273 --> 53:56.817
but she'll bounce back.

53:57.902 --> 54:00.652
My real father married her twice.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.908
Their second honeymoon,

54:03.991 --> 54:07.325
we all went to stay down
on Key Biscayne.

54:08.204 --> 54:11.499
They just started
goin' at it in the same old way,

54:11.582 --> 54:13.582
yellin' their heads off.

54:15.044 --> 54:20.007
So right out of the blue,
my dad just gets up off the couch,

54:20.091 --> 54:22.468
walks out the door,

54:22.551 --> 54:24.387
keeps on walkin'

54:25.346 --> 54:27.096
right into the ocean.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.184
Still had his clothes on.

54:32.478 --> 54:35.812
Probably still
had his drink in his hand.

54:37.441 --> 54:40.778
Anyway, the point is, about a half
a minute after they buried my dad,

54:40.861 --> 54:43.695
my mom made the fuckin' mortician.

54:44.865 --> 54:47.702
What a fuckin' creepy guy he was.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.704
Leopold.

54:49.787 --> 54:52.540
A fuckin' creepy mortician.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.958
Very creepy living with that guy.

55:31.329 --> 55:33.873
11:00. Twenty more dollars.

56:43.567 --> 56:45.945
Hey, roachy.

57:06.674 --> 57:10.010
<i>It's funny how a person could</i>
<i>leave everything she knew behind</i>

57:10.094 --> 57:13.594
<i>and still wind up</i>
<i>in such a familiar place.</i>

57:33.909 --> 57:37.371
<i>I stood near the water,</i>
<i>thinking about different things</i>

57:37.455 --> 57:39.415
<i>and sometimes catching</i>
<i>a glimpse of my life,</i>

57:39.498 --> 57:43.210
<i>as if I was thumbing</i>
<i>through an old photo album.</i>

57:43.294 --> 57:47.840
<i>I saw my dad being young</i>
<i>and playing jazz in our Florida room</i>

57:47.923 --> 57:52.052
<i>while my mom laid naked</i>
<i>on the cold terrazzo floor.</i>

57:52.136 --> 57:54.722
<i>I saw Bobby</i>
<i>in his black-and-white uniform,</i>

57:54.805 --> 57:57.183
<i>and I could almost smell</i>
<i>that restaurant stench</i>

57:57.266 --> 58:00.394
<i>that had become</i>
<i>so much a part of him.</i>

58:00.478 --> 58:04.231
<i>And I saw Lee in his blue car</i>
<i>nearly runnin' me down,</i>

58:04.315 --> 58:08.482
<i>looking so much like a guy</i>
<i>on his way to somewhere.</i>

58:46.190 --> 58:48.776
Come on, Jimmy,
let me take you home.

58:48.859 --> 58:51.111
Nah, this'll do fine.

58:51.195 --> 58:52.696
Everybody's leaving.

58:52.780 --> 58:56.280
Anyway, you don't wanna
start drinkin' now.

58:56.450 --> 58:59.620
What's she doin' with this guy?

58:59.703 --> 59:03.832
I think the thing to do is go ahead
and put an APB out on these kids.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.918
She's no kid.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.166
New York City?
Yeah.

01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.968
I'd like a refund, please.
Cash refund.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:17.732
They're a little old.
I never used 'em.

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:59.234
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.625
Come on, come on, come on.
What- What is up?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:19.792
We're gettin' out of here. You
look like you just saw a ghost.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.174
Aren't we gettin' on the bus?

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:24.134
That place was filled
with fuckin' deadbeats.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.553
I don't see anything.
You weren't in there.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.848
What about New York?
We can drive to New York.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:33.060
Damn it! I hate buses.
I can't even get on a fuckin' bus.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:36.560
Well, what were we
doin' at a bus station?

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.698
Shit.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:35.455
You got any money? Me? No,
I don't have any money.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.624
I don't have the fuckin' toll.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.710
We need a quarter.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.386
What the fuck we gonna do?

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.225
Cozy, come on.
Run it.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:56.977
We can't run it.
Go!

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:00.981
Shit.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:11.570
You have to pull over there
to the side for me, please.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:54.615
May I see your license
and registration? Yes.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:05.041
Just your license and registration,
not your wallet.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.720
Lee Ray Harold, North Miami?

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.555
That's you?
Yep.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.358
Lee, this is your car?

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.610
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:30.988
All right, I'm going
to ask both of you to sit right here

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:32.988
till I come back, okay?

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.832
Lee, we're through. Just be still.
Everything's okay.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.084
What is okay?
Where's the gun?

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.919
What are you gonna do with it?
Nothing.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:49.089
Lee, he's calling on his radio.
He's gonna find out.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.174
- Cozy, where the fuck is the gun?
- You can't shoot a cop.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:53.260
I'm not gonna shoot the
fuckin'- Let me drive.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.178
Jesus, Cozy, will you cool it?
Let me drive!

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:59.512
We didn't kill anybody.
He wasn't even fuckin' hurt.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:06.604
Lee, do you have money with you?
Um-

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:10.027
You do know this is a toll road?
Yeah.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:15.610
Florida Highway Patrol doesn't tread
lightly on toll-gate crashers.

01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:18.160
You still at this
North Miami address?

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:20.537
Yeah.
Okay.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.540
Tell you what I'm gonna ask you to do.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:26.043
I want you to turn your car
completely around

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:30.005
and head on back home
to North Miami.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.716
And the next time you think
you wanna take a ride on a toll road,

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.469
you make sure you have money
in your pocket

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.637
and a cool head on your shoulders.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.222
You hear me?
Yeah.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:41.266
Okay.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.018
You take care now.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.354
<i>Suddenly, I wasn't sure of anything.</i>

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:30.148
<i>I wasn't on the lam after all.</i>

01:08:30.232 --> 01:08:32.609
<i>I wasn't layin' low or ducking cops,</i>

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:36.029
<i>and if I was, no one cared.</i>

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.448
<i>We hadn't killed anybody.</i>

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:43.828
<i>I couldn't even be sure we had really killed
the palmetto bug back in the motel room.</i>

01:08:43.912 --> 01:08:48.125
<i>So if we weren't killers,</i>
<i>we weren't anything.</i>

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.211
Cozy, I'm sorry.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:58.214
I was gonna tell you
as soon as we got out of Florida.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:07.537
You know my friend Doug and his girlfriend
Julia, they have this apartment.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:13.455
It's not too big, but the rent's
pretty cheap. We could stay with them.

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:18.295
I could get a job.
Maybe get two jobs for a while.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.050
Get some money comin' in.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.891
Couple months,
we could get an apartment.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:33.563
Maybe in the same complex.
