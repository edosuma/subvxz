EUGENE MULCHANDANI

00:20.107 --> 00:22.848
TO GO TO WAR.

FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT PROOF
OF HIS UNDYING PATRIOTISM,

FROM AN ADVANCED GEOMETRY LESSON

OF THE PYTHAGOREAN KIND.

SOLVED THE HUNTER'S MURDER,

01:06.544 --> 01:13.073
THE ACCLAIM WOULD BRING
HIS FATHER BACK INTO HIS LIFE.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.162
BUT THE HUNTER REVEALED
HIS CAUSE OF DEATH

WAS ACCIDENTAL
AND SELF-INFLICTED.

01:17.990 --> 01:21.211

TO BE CAUGHT.

WOULD BELIEVE OTHERWISE.

OF HIS PARENTAL ALLIES...

18:25.321 --> 18:27.149
HONESTLY -- AND THIS IS
A PETTY ACCUSATION,

18:27.193 --> 18:28.716
THEREFORE I'M NOT PROUD --

18:28.759 --> 18:32.502
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE
THAT HE MADE ME HAPPY.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.678
DWIGHT DIXON IS TROUBLE.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.985
DWIGHT DIXON LAVISHED ME
WITH COURTLY BLANDISHMENTS

18:37.028 --> 18:39.683
AND PICNICS COMPLETE
WITH CRUDITES AND SOUP.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
INVOLVEMENT

18:41.555 --> 18:43.774
WITH A CRIMINAL ELEMENT
IN HIS PAST,

18:43.818 --> 18:45.689
BUT THAT'S BEHIND HIM NOW.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
IT AIN'T BEHIND HIM.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.345
IT'S RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM,
IF NOT INSIDE HIM.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.218
HIS MOTEL ROOM
HAD ENOUGH BUCKSHOT

18:52.261 --> 18:54.176
TO BLOW COEUR d'COEURS
TO TIMBUKTU!

18:54.220 --> 18:57.136
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN HIS MOTEL ROOM?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.749
LOOKING FOR THIS.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.012
CHARLES'S POCKET WATCH.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.187
YOUR KIND DWIGHT

19:05.231 --> 19:07.885
STOLE IT
FROM CHARLOTTE'S GRAVE

19:07.929 --> 19:10.366
RIGHT AFTER YOU TOLD HIM
WHERE IT WAS.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.412
H-HE DIDN'T --
HE COULDN'T -- HE...

19:12.455 --> 19:14.979
HE DUG HER UP?

19:15.023 --> 19:18.113
HE DUG HER UP
AND TOOK IT FROM HER.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.724
SO I TOOK IT BACK
AND TOOK HIS WATCH, TOO.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.466
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN

19:23.510 --> 19:26.034
BETWEEN ME AND DWIGHT
AT THE CEMETERY IF HE SHOWED?

19:26.077 --> 19:28.384
ME AND BOTH BARRELS
WERE GONNA CONVINCE HIM

19:28.428 --> 19:30.952
TO DIG CHARLOTTE'S GRAVE
RIGHT UP AGAIN

19:30.995 --> 19:35.217
AND PUT THAT WATCH BACK
EXACTLY WHERE HE FOUND IT.

19:35.261 --> 19:39.003
AND YOUR INTENTIONS
AFTER THAT?

19:39.047 --> 19:41.310
THAT WAS GONNA BE
UP TO DWIGHT.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.142
CONGRATULATIONS, LILY.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.884
I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE
BEING RIGHT.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.320
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RI--

19:51.364 --> 19:54.410
I KNEW I WAS GONNA BE,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE.

19:54.454 --> 19:58.458
I DON'T GET ANY SATISFACTION
FROM SEEING YOU HURT.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.897
NOW I REALLY
DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.730
Narrator: AS THE COLD SNAP
BETWEEN THE AUNTS GREW COLDER,

20:09.773 --> 20:12.385
THE PIE MAKER AND CHUCK
WERE INVESTIGATING

20:12.428 --> 20:15.736
THE EQUALLY SERIOUS MATTER
OF THE MISSING CHARLES CHARLES.

20:15.779 --> 20:19.043
Ned: BRINGING BACK THE DEAD
IS ALWAYS COMPLICATED.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.436
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO

20:20.480 --> 20:23.657
FOCUS ON THE TREE
INSTEAD OF THE FOREST.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.615
YOU HAVE TO FIND
THAT ONE THING

20:25.659 --> 20:30.664
AND THAT TINY GLIMMER OF HOPE
AND JUST HOLD ONTO IT.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.144
WAIT. WHAT'S THAT?

20:33.188 --> 20:35.973
IT'S ANOTHER BUTTON,
A BIG BRASS BUTTON.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.106
IT'S PLACED CONSPICUOUSLY
ON THE WINDOWSILL.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.282
IT MIGHT HAVE POPPED OFF
MY DAD'S SWEATER

20:40.326 --> 20:42.502
21 YEARS, 2 MONTHS,
AND 24 DAYS AGO --

20:42.545 --> 20:44.547
THE DAY HE MOVED OUT
AND ABANDONED ME.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.288
OR MAYBE IT'S A SIGN
FROM MY DAD.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.203
HE'D ALWAYS GIVE ME
A BUTTON TO HOLD ONTO

20:48.247 --> 20:49.944
ON LONG JOURNEYS
TO SUMMER CAMP,

20:49.987 --> 20:52.729
OR HE'D SNEAK ONE IN MY POCKET
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

20:52.773 --> 20:55.689
TO LET ME KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE
AND HE WAS WATCHING ME

20:55.732 --> 20:57.256
AND THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD BE OKAY.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.996
CHUCK, IT'S...

20:59.040 --> 21:02.348
MAYBE THE REASON THAT I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT HE JUST LEFT

21:02.391 --> 21:04.393
IS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.004
MAYBE HE'S KEEPING
A SAFE DISTANCE.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.658
IS THAT REALISTIC?

21:08.702 --> 21:12.358
MY LIFE HAS BEEN SO UNREAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT REALISTIC IS.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.621
I DIED...
AND THEN I WAS ALIVE AGAIN.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.536
AND SO WAS MY DAD,
AND IT'S SOMETHING

21:16.579 --> 21:20.235
THAT WE BOTH SHARE THAT NOBODY
ELSE CAN, WHICH IS WHY I KNOW.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.238
NED, I KNOW, AND I FEEL IT
DEEP, DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF ME

21:23.282 --> 21:25.240
THAT HE WOULDN'T
ABANDON ME.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.938
HE'S HERE.
HE'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.113
UM...

21:29.157 --> 21:32.247
YOU CAN'T HANG ALL THAT
ON A BUTTON.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.640
YES, I CAN.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.685
I'M HIS BUTTON-BUTTON.

Narrator: WHILE CHUCK HOPED
THE OLD, BRASS BUTTON

21:38.340 --> 21:42.910
WAS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF HER

131 MILES DUE NORTH,

21:44.868 --> 21:48.176
THE NORWEGIANS CONTINUED
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

21:48.219 --> 21:51.527
ALL THE WHILE, KEEPING
A WATCHFUL EYE ON EMERSON COD,

21:51.571 --> 21:55.488
WHO THEY BELIEVED KNEW MORE
THAN HE WAS WILLING TO SAY.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.925

IN THE HOPE
THAT THE FORENSIC BREAD CRUMBS

22:02.233 --> 22:03.670
FROM DWIGHT'S MOTEL ROOM

22:03.713 --> 22:06.934
WOULD NOT LEAD THE NORWEGIANS
BACK HIS WAY.

22:06.977 --> 22:10.329
USING THE GUMSHOE SKILLS
THAT MADE HIM GREAT,

22:10.372 --> 22:13.506
THE NUMBER-ONE DETECTIVE
IN PAPEN COUNTY

22:13.549 --> 22:15.421
TOOK THE FIGHT TO HIS OPPONENT.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.988
HIS PLAN WAS THIS --

22:18.032 --> 22:22.210
FIRST, ASSESS THE TRUE NATURE
OF THE THREAT.

22:22.253 --> 22:27.084
TWO, FIND AND EXPLOIT

YOU GUYS THINK

ARE UP TO NO GOOD, TOO.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.096
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FINGERS
AND TOES

22:39.140 --> 22:41.403
TO COUNT THE SECRETS
THAT THEY FLAUNT IN MY FACE.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.144
OH,
AND THAT DWIGHT DIXON,

22:43.187 --> 22:45.494
HE DID HANG AROUND
THE PIE HOLE...A LOT.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.366
UNTIL HE DIDN'T.
AND THEN YOU GUYS SHOW UP,

22:47.409 --> 22:50.978
AND THEY'RE JUMPIER THAN A BUNCH
OF KANGAROOS ON A POGO STICK.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.894

TO KILL A MAN, PERHAPS?

23:03.164 --> 23:05.035
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
YOU TELL ME.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.646
THERE'S PLENTY OF
SOMETHIN'-SOMETHIN' GOING ON

WITH THOSE DIRTY BIRDS, AND
SINCE YOU'RE ALL ABOUT

23:08.865 --> 23:10.780
GETTING ANSWERS,
AND SO AM I, I FIGURED

23:10.824 --> 23:13.217
IT WAS ABOUT TIME
I JOINED THE A-TEAM.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.395
WHICH IS WHY WE WERE EXCITED
TO RECEIVE YOUR INQUIRY

23:16.438 --> 23:18.309
ABOUT JOINING
OUR ORGANIZATION.

23:18.353 --> 23:22.313
Nils: THE DNA ANALYSIS
THAT I PERFORMED ON YOUR HAIR

23:22.357 --> 23:25.186
TOLD US EVERYTHING
WE NEEDED TO KNOW.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.144
OH. I WAS
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

23:27.188 --> 23:28.972
THAT PENICILLIN
WOULD CLEAR THAT UP.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.802

THAT YOU'RE OF GOOD, STRONG,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.075
OH! YOU TOO.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.208
WHICH GOES WITHOUT SAYING
SINCE YOU'RE SO OBVIOUSLY

23:47.251 --> 23:48.688
FROM THE LAND OF NORWEGIA.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.690

YOU GUYS HAVE SERIOUSLY
PIMPED THIS RIDE.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.482
THIS IS FANCIER
THAN LIBERACE'S CAMPER!

24:00.526 --> 24:02.223

OF WHAT WE DO.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.490
[ LAUGHTER ]

24:08.534 --> 24:10.971
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
TO DWIGHT DIXON?

24:11.014 --> 24:12.625
HE APPEARS
TO HAVE VANISHED.

24:12.668 --> 24:15.497
AND HOW HE VANISHED PROBABLY
WASN'T PRETTY LIKE YOU.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.456
HE HAD ENOUGH WEAPONS
IN HIS ROOM

24:17.499 --> 24:18.848
TO ARM
THE NORWEGIAN MILITIA.

24:18.892 --> 24:22.069

CAN YOU HANDLE MORE?

24:32.209 --> 24:33.907
IT'S GETTING HOTTER
FROM HERE.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.213
WE ALSO FIND A SHOVEL

24:36.257 --> 24:38.085
THE MINERAL CONTENT
OF THE CAKED-ON DIRT

24:38.128 --> 24:41.218

MAYBE IT'S
STOCKHOLM SYNDROME.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.721
THEY'VE LURED HER IN, AND SHE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING.

25:05.765 --> 25:08.507
CHITTY-CHATTY-BOO-HOO KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.944
SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY LUBED
AND READY TO SPIT TACKS.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.728
SHE EVEN GAVE THEM

INTO THEIR CLUBHOUSE.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.905
WHAT WOULD THEY WANT
WITH MY SALIVA?

25:15.949 --> 25:17.559
IT'S MY FAULT. SHE WARNED US NOT

25:17.603 --> 25:19.169
TO PUSH HER,
AND THEN I PUSHED HER AWAY,

25:19.213 --> 25:20.910
AND I PUSHED HER
TO TALK TO VIVIAN,

25:20.954 --> 25:23.260

TO SWITCH TEAMS.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.784

COMES BACK TO MY MAGIC FINGER.

ARE GONNA HAVE THE COFFINS OF

IN THE OTHER ONE

26:13.354 --> 26:15.356

OF DWIGHT DIXON.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.281
OH, GOD.

SUPPOSE HE WIPED DOWN
