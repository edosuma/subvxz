00:14.766 --> 00:19.187
- How long will Prescott detain me?
- Until after the press conference.

00:19.354 --> 00:24.776
In two hours he'll announce our response
to the bomb and his ascension to president.

00:24.943 --> 00:28.571
I've done with Bauer.
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.

00:28.738 --> 00:31.616
We're onto other things.
You've been reassigned.

00:31.783 --> 00:33.368
You can't reassign me now.

00:33.535 --> 00:37.872
You have made yourself
a liability I can't afford.

00:38.915 --> 00:40.709
This is Kim Bauer. I need my dad.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.712
- What's wrong?
- I'm at the Mathesons' house.

00:43.878 --> 00:47.298
Gary's here. He has a gun. He killed
the policeman that brought me.

00:47.465 --> 00:52.637
I want you to point the gun at his chest
and pull the trigger now.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.681
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

00:54.848 --> 01:00.061
I'll send someone to pick you up.
Go downstairs and wait for them.

01:00.228 --> 01:03.064
I am certain the Cyprus audio has
been forged.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.651
I have in custody the man who engineered it.
I'll bring him in soon.

01:06.818 --> 01:10.113
- How will it work?
- I'll make a recording for them, on the spot.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.408
Shift it around, reframe segments,
same specs as Cyprus.

01:13.575 --> 01:16.119
- Where are you going?
- This is taking too long.

01:16.286 --> 01:21.374
We're the only ones who can help you.
Without us, you don't stand a chance.

01:38.892 --> 01:40.894
Thank you.

01:42.187 --> 01:45.774
- How's Chappelle?
- Still unconscious, but he's starting to stir.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.985
The drug I gave him is short-acting.
He may need more.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.613
How long can you keep pumping him full?

01:51.780 --> 01:56.910
Long enough for Jack to deliver Hewitt.
How are we coming on the chopper?

01:57.076 --> 02:01.539
It should land at Hewitt's in ten minutes.
We should have him here in half an hour.

02:01.706 --> 02:04.459
- Is Carrie asking about Chappelle?
- Not yet, no.

02:04.626 --> 02:07.712
Image processing should
keep her busy for a while.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.839
Excuse me, Mr Almeida?

02:10.006 --> 02:13.968
Brad Hammond from Division wants
Mr Chappelle. Do you know where he is?

02:14.135 --> 02:18.848
No, I'll take it. This is Tony Almeida.
How can I help you, sir?

02:19.015 --> 02:22.310
- Where's Ryan?
- I'm not sure.

02:22.477 --> 02:25.146
His office says he arrived
at CTU three hours ago.

02:25.313 --> 02:28.608
- None of your people can find him.
- He must have stepped out.

02:28.775 --> 02:31.778
He didn't log out.
Did he say where he was going?

02:31.945 --> 02:35.448
Not to me, sir, but I'll
let you know as soon as I find him.

02:35.615 --> 02:38.409
No, you'll tell me what's going on over there.

02:38.576 --> 02:41.788
I know Ryan Chappelle was
going to assess the situation.

02:41.955 --> 02:45.875
I cannot think why he would be
out of contact during a national crisis.

02:46.042 --> 02:49.504
Mr Hammond, I'm sorry,
I've told you all that I know, sir.

02:49.671 --> 02:52.006
I'll make sure Ryan calls when he returns.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.592
- You do that.
- Thank you, sir.

02:58.179 --> 03:01.641
- What's goin' on?
- Division knows something's up.

03:01.808 --> 03:07.188
- So what are we gonna do?
- Get Alex Hewitt here as quickly as possible.

03:26.374 --> 03:31.921
Alex, if you don't come with me,
Kingsley will kill you. You know that.

03:34.924 --> 03:40.430
I just did what they told me.
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

03:44.601 --> 03:48.855
Your only way outta this
is to let me take you into CTU.

03:49.022 --> 03:52.442
You can cut a deal, testify.

03:53.735 --> 03:56.863
Alex, you're gonna have to trust me.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.597
Alex! Stop running.

04:34.484 --> 04:36.444
Alex, just listen to me.

04:36.611 --> 04:40.198
A chopper's on its way to take us to CTU,
where no one can hurt you.

04:40.365 --> 04:45.745
Please, Alex. Help me stop this war
and I will help you stay alive, I promise.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.747
Please.

04:51.918 --> 04:54.253
Stop, dammit.

05:23.449 --> 05:27.870
I know the oil stocks closed high in
Hong Kong last night, Max, but remember,

05:28.037 --> 05:32.709
once the president announces the war,
the margins will change dramatically.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.838
- Prices will spike immediately.
- It's still worth acquiring shares.

05:37.005 --> 05:40.466
- Do we still have our problem?
- That'll be taken care of.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.344
- This must go smoothly.
- Don't worry about it.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.180
- I have to go.
- OK.

05:47.974 --> 05:52.061
- What'd you get?
- All the recordings and data.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.272
But no Hewitt?

05:55.356 --> 05:58.526
We got there as soon as we could,
but I had no lead time.

05:58.693 --> 06:02.905
Everything, including Hewitt, was
meant to have been vaporised last night.

06:03.072 --> 06:07.744
I won't let some pimply-faced techie
ruin everything that we've planned.

06:07.910 --> 06:14.083
If he gets brought in and testifies, there's
gonna be no place for any of us to hide.

07:09.472 --> 07:13.142
There's nowhere left to run. It's over.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.608
All right. You promise I'll be safe?

07:20.775 --> 07:23.111
I give you my word.

07:25.029 --> 07:29.408
Alex, drop the gun. Drop the gun.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.913
If you try to shoot me, I will have
to shoot you back, and I won't miss.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.958
And I don't wanna do that.

07:38.042 --> 07:42.213
I can't stop this war without you, Alex.
Please, drop the gun.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.091
Please, drop the gun.

07:45.258 --> 07:48.386
Alex, you're a smart guy. Think this through.

07:48.553 --> 07:51.472
I am the only guy that
can get you through this alive.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.641
Please, drop the gun.

07:55.685 --> 07:58.229
Drop the gun.

08:03.985 --> 08:08.489
- You shot me. You shot me.
- It's gonna be all right.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.991
No!

08:17.999 --> 08:20.459
Can you hear me?

08:20.626 --> 08:24.881
OK, stay calm. Don't move.
You're gonna be all right.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.384
- What happened?
- You fell.

08:32.471 --> 08:36.601
Alex, stay with me.
I want you to keep your eyes open, OK?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.645
Just keep your eyes open. OK.

08:42.773 --> 08:47.278
You're OK. The bullet didn't hit an artery.
The chopper should be here soon.

08:47.445 --> 08:49.947
- You're not gonna bleed to death.
- It hurts.

08:50.114 --> 08:56.204
I'm gonna get you something for the pain
as soon as we get on the chopper.

08:58.789 --> 09:03.377
Is there any other part of your body
besides your leg that still hurts?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.547
No, not really.

09:06.714 --> 09:11.928
OK, good. It looks like you got lucky.
You're gonna be fine.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.680
My head feels wet.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.645
Just relax. Try and relax.

09:27.318 --> 09:30.613
Just put your head down.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.325
OK.

09:52.260 --> 09:57.223
I gotta make a phone call, OK?
I'm not goin' anywhere. Stay with me.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.145
Come on.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.110
- Almeida.
- It's Jack. Hewitt's been hurt.

10:09.277 --> 10:11.946
I need medical assistance on the roof now.

10:12.113 --> 10:15.741
There's no EMT on the chopper,
but there's a med kit. Can you handle it?

10:15.908 --> 10:18.953
I don't know. I hope so.
Look, I gotta get back to this.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.579
- Wait.
- What?

10:20.746 --> 10:23.666
You may not be able to contact me after this.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.669
- Why?
- Chappelle became a problem.

10:26.836 --> 10:29.297
I had to take him out of play,
and they're onto me.

10:29.463 --> 10:33.509
- They'll take me out soon.
- Who do I contact if I need help?

10:33.676 --> 10:38.472
Michelle is setting up an off-site station.
She'll do what she can by remote access.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.768
She'll be on her closed cell,
channel B, node 12-12.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.062
- B, node 12-12. I got it.
- Good luck.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.398
Thanks.

10:47.565 --> 10:50.443
Alex, how you doin'?

10:59.869 --> 11:02.621
This'll get you into the van.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.876
- How will I break through the firewall?
- This has a range of a few blocks.

11:07.043 --> 11:13.007
It's Huffman encoded. It'll get you in.
Give me a call when you're set, all right?

11:20.306 --> 11:21.349
- Michelle.
- Hi.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.935
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to my car.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.520
- Are you leaving?
- No.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.148
I'm just getting something.
Is there a problem?

11:29.315 --> 11:32.568
- Have you seen Chappelle?
- No.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.780
I've looked everywhere and I can't find him.

11:35.946 --> 11:40.159
If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.872
And if you don't see him?

11:45.039 --> 11:48.084
What's that supposed to mean?

11:48.250 --> 11:51.420
My job is to monitor
communications around here.

11:51.587 --> 11:55.966
- You don't think I know what's goin' on?
- Why don't you tell me, Carrie?

11:56.133 --> 11:59.637
You called Chappelle in to see Rudin.
I just talked to Rudin.

11:59.804 --> 12:04.016
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- Well, of course he told you that.

12:04.183 --> 12:07.937
His system wasn't loaded properly
and it was your fault.

12:08.104 --> 12:13.025
He wanted to see Chappelle
to complain about you.

12:13.192 --> 12:17.947
Stay out of my business, Carrie.
You'll do a better job.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.503
Brian. How did you find out about me?

12:32.670 --> 12:35.714
The Attorney General said
you'd want me for your counsel.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.135
- What have they told you?
- You'd been removed from office

12:39.301 --> 12:41.345
under the 25th Amendment.

12:41.512 --> 12:45.224
- Is what they did legal?
- Technically, yes.

12:45.391 --> 12:48.394
The cabinet can declare
the president incompetent

12:48.561 --> 12:51.730
without further definition or clarification.

12:51.897 --> 12:56.944
- That also gives me the right to appeal.
- Yes, which I will do vigorously.

12:57.111 --> 13:00.573
- Unfortunately, it's a lengthy process.
- We don't have time.

13:00.739 --> 13:05.828
- I don't know how to make it go any faster.
- None of those legalities matter.

13:05.995 --> 13:09.665
We're about to go to war based on
evidence that I am convinced is false.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.626
No one outside this room believes that.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.963
The evidence was manipulated
by a man named Peter Kingsley.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.674
I need you to find out all you can about him.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.343
Mike Novick's tying my hands.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.847
Get him to untie them -
whatever you have to do.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.849
Yes, sir.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.271
- Almeida.
- I'm in place.

13:32.438 --> 13:34.815
- Where are you?
- I'm in the north lot.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.152
Van 15a. Listen, Tony, Carrie's onto us.

13:38.319 --> 13:41.363
- She was asking about Chappelle.
- What did you tell her?

13:41.530 --> 13:44.700
That I didn't know anything,
but we need her out of the way.

13:44.867 --> 13:48.496
- Keep her occupied.
- OK, I'll handle it. Get ahold of Jack.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.748
I gotta go. Hammond's here.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.211
- Mr Hammond.
- Tony.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.130
- What are you doing here?
- I told you on the phone.

13:58.297 --> 14:03.135
I think there's a problem here.
Where's Ryan Chappelle?

14:03.302 --> 14:06.972
- I haven't seen him yet, sir.
- I see.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.517
Two of you take this side.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.977
I want this section covered.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.730
- What are you doin'?
- I'm locking you down.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.109
We're in the middle of preparing
a domestic response to this war.

14:19.276 --> 14:24.949
That's not what I heard. I heard you were
supporting a rogue agent against orders.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.535
- Where'd you hear that?
- One of your people.

14:27.701 --> 14:31.121
Let's go. Cover every square inch of the place.

14:43.509 --> 14:46.929
- I'm aware of that.
- That flyover space is critical.

14:47.096 --> 14:50.307
- Will David help us?
- I don't know.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.728
I don't see us having much success with him.

14:54.895 --> 14:59.608
- We need this, Mike.
- Yes, sir, I'll try. How is he?

14:59.775 --> 15:03.654
David is convinced his decision
to hold off on the bombers was correct.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.948
He'll appeal his removal from office.

15:06.115 --> 15:10.619
- The 25th Amendment gives him that right.
- We'll prove we're being manipulated

15:10.786 --> 15:16.875
and that the Cyprus recording was falsified,
plus we now think we know by whom.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.713
- I'm listening.
- A man named Peter Kingsley.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.924
He's got ties to oil interests
both here and abroad.

15:24.091 --> 15:28.178
Have you found anything to connect him
to the Cyprus recording, or the bomb?

15:28.345 --> 15:32.641
No. We won't be able to without
access to the Intelligence database.

15:32.808 --> 15:36.562
David's locked down until we've
gone public with the military action.

15:36.729 --> 15:38.897
- By then it'll be too late.
- I'm sorry.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.233
Mike, wait. Just hold on a second.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.280
I remember when you signed up for David's
first run at the Senate over 20 years ago.

15:46.447 --> 15:50.701
That's a lot of history
to just throw out the window.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.124
Come on, Mike.

15:57.291 --> 16:02.504
I know you just did what you thought
was right, but let him try to prove his case.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.341
You owe him that.

16:13.057 --> 16:16.769
I'll have Colleen set up
a computer station for you.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.272
You won't be able to transmit
outgoing messages.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.983
That's fair enough.

16:25.861 --> 16:30.908
- What's in here?
- A holding room. No one's in there now.

16:31.075 --> 16:33.118
All right.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.508
- And this?
- The other holding room.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.179
It shouldn't be locked.

16:53.597 --> 16:58.686
- What's wrong?
- Someone must have reconfigured the lock.

17:15.911 --> 17:18.747
Come on, Alex. Keep talking to me.

17:18.914 --> 17:22.376
Everything's a little blurry.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.338
What's happening to me?

17:26.505 --> 17:30.634
Nothing. You just banged your head.
It's gonna be all right, OK?

17:30.801 --> 17:33.721
You just hang in there.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.935
Alex, I can hear 'em. They're coming, OK?

17:40.102 --> 17:43.981
Help's on the way. Just hang in there, OK?

17:53.240 --> 17:57.494
I've located the CTU chopper
that Tony Almeida sent to Jack Bauer.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.456
They're landing.
Would you like them to detain Bauer?

18:00.622 --> 18:04.293
No, I don't wanna waste
any more resources on him.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.504
Just get the chopper back here.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.882
Mr Chappelle wants you to come back now.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.842
- We're about to land.
- I know.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.136
- I can see him.
- Just do it.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.606
What are you waiting for?

18:25.773 --> 18:29.193
- I'm putting her down.
- No, cancel that.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.237
Land the chopper now.

18:32.404 --> 18:36.950
What are you doing?
Land the damn chopper.

18:39.411 --> 18:42.748
My witness is gonna die. Land.

18:48.420 --> 18:52.591
Your orders are to pick us up. Pick us up now.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.054
Dammit.

19:00.933 --> 19:04.353
- Dessler.
- The chopper won't pick us up.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.606
- Hammond's locked us down.
- I don't give a damn.

19:07.773 --> 19:11.401
Get me that chopper back. Hewitt is dying.

19:38.637 --> 19:44.518
- Want me to deal with Almeida?
- No, Brad, thanks. I'll take care of him myself.

19:45.978 --> 19:49.189
- Michelle, it's me.
- Jack, where are you?

19:49.356 --> 19:53.694
Going back to Hewitt's loft. Set up and
be ready to interface with his computer.

19:53.861 --> 19:58.282
- What about Hewitt?
- He didn't make it. He's dead.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.950
I'm sorry.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.995
Call me when you're ready.

20:10.294 --> 20:13.005
- Yes?
- I need to speak with you.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.173
It concerns national security.

20:15.340 --> 20:19.303
As I am not the commander in chief
any more, that's irrelevant.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.972
We have a problem with
the Turkish government.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.850
Our Stealth bombers are
nearing their airspace,

20:25.017 --> 20:28.770
but one of their fighter patrols
spotted them a few minutes ago.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.899
Ask the prime minister for the flyover.
He should agree.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.484
The secretary of state has spoken to him.

20:34.651 --> 20:38.614
- He'll grant us this under one condition.
- What's the condition?

20:38.780 --> 20:44.536
He wants a personal request
and assurances from the president.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.956
The prime minister doesn't know
I've been removed from office.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.626
He couldn't be told
before the American people.

20:50.792 --> 20:54.129
That wouldn't be right, would it, Mike?

20:54.296 --> 20:56.673
Now that the bombers have been spotted,

20:56.840 --> 21:00.427
it's critical that they get
to their targets quickly.

21:00.594 --> 21:04.973
Any detour will take them
over unfriendly skies.

21:05.140 --> 21:11.563
You want me to speak to the prime minister,
under the pretence that I'm still the president?

21:11.730 --> 21:13.774
Yes.

21:13.941 --> 21:17.319
This mission is going to
continue regardless, sir.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.738
This phone call, no matter how distasteful,

21:19.905 --> 21:23.450
could prevent those planes
from being attacked.

21:23.617 --> 21:26.495
We only have minutes, sir.

21:38.882 --> 21:42.094
Why did you leave me like this?
I've been stabbed.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.180
Let me look at it.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.391
Be careful.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.852
You're lucky. The wound's superficial.

21:51.019 --> 21:55.983
The bleeding's already stopped.
I'll get you a clean bandage for it.

21:56.149 --> 22:00.237
- Where's Alex?
- He fell. He's dead.

22:00.404 --> 22:03.448
Oh, my God. What happens now?

22:04.700 --> 22:07.369
You are going to help me.

22:07.536 --> 22:09.871
Just put this right here.

22:10.038 --> 22:13.333
- Help you do what?
- We got one last play.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.545
- To deliver Kingsley.
- No.

22:16.712 --> 22:20.841
He's far too dangerous,
and you'll never get close to him.

22:21.008 --> 22:24.136
You're right. I won't, but you will.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.972
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.

22:27.139 --> 22:30.684
If you say you can deliver him,
that should get his attention.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.146
Kingsley has evidence that will
implicate me. There is no way...

22:34.312 --> 22:36.148
Mrs Palmer, you...

22:39.359 --> 22:41.361
What?

22:43.238 --> 22:45.449
It's nothing. I'm fine.

22:45.615 --> 22:49.411
Don't tell me it's nothing. What's going on?

22:53.749 --> 22:57.377
My heart stopped when
Kingsley's men were interrogating me.

22:57.544 --> 23:01.631
Your heart could be damaged.
You need to get to a doctor.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.760
We need to get Kingsley first.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.888
Mrs Palmer, you are going to help me.

23:08.055 --> 23:11.600
I'm not gonna give you another choice.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.644
You wouldn't dare hurt me.

23:14.811 --> 23:19.149
Make no mistake about it.
I will do what I have to do.

23:23.070 --> 23:25.113
What do you want me to do?

23:25.280 --> 23:29.534
Tell Kingsley you'll exchange Hewitt
for any evidence that incriminates you.

23:29.701 --> 23:33.371
He'll want proof that I have Hewitt.

23:33.538 --> 23:36.833
- He'll get it.
- How?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.503
Hewitt's gonna talk to him.

23:42.172 --> 23:46.009
At this point, we can assume the chip
containing the source recordings

23:46.176 --> 23:48.345
has not landed in government hands.

23:48.512 --> 23:53.391
Did you intercept the federal agent
who was in possession of the chip?

23:53.558 --> 23:56.770
No. But since the bombers are still on course,

23:56.937 --> 24:00.482
we can assume that he wasn't
able to deliver it to the president.

24:00.649 --> 24:05.987
Which leaves Hewitt as the last remaining
loose end. Where are we on finding him?

24:06.154 --> 24:09.449
I have several teams out looking for him.

24:09.616 --> 24:14.121
He cannot be allowed to talk.
Not now, nor ever.

24:14.287 --> 24:18.208
Hewitt will be found, and he'll be eliminated.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.627
Clean this up, Peter.

24:29.845 --> 24:36.726
Go over it again, even if you need
to pull a couple of agents in to help you.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.157
I don't need to tell you you're under arrest.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.368
- Where's Michelle Dessler?
- She knew nothing about this.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.829
She called me to the room
where you drugged me.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.456
She didn't know what I was gonna do.

24:58.623 --> 25:01.877
I need to issue a warrant.
Contact local police, issue a memo.

25:02.043 --> 25:05.046
- I can find her.
- How?

25:05.964 --> 25:11.720
This whole thing's been about helping Jack
Bauer. She's doing that somewhere off-site.

25:11.887 --> 25:14.598
- How do we find her?
- Track her access code.

25:14.764 --> 25:17.851
See if she's logged onto
the CTU computer network.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.687
- Then do it.
- Right away.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.275
Put him in Holding 2.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.756
- Yeah?
- I'm connected to his computer.

25:47.923 --> 25:51.009
Press "escape" and I can take control.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.803
- Done.
- What did Hewitt tell you?

25:53.970 --> 25:56.765
He had a program
that could recreate anybody's voice.

25:56.932 --> 26:00.101
With a voice sample,
he could get it to say anything.

26:00.268 --> 26:03.897
He kept all the audio files in a main file.

26:07.025 --> 26:10.070
All right, I think I've found it.

26:12.113 --> 26:15.492
I've never seen this.
Samples connect through an integrator.

26:15.659 --> 26:20.747
- I need anything with Hewitt's voice on it.
- All right, hold on.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.753
I'm gonna need Berkeley
and Wilkerson at that lunch.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.547
- Is that him?
- No, dammit.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.800
There's hundreds of files. Hold on.

26:31.967 --> 26:34.719
Mrs Palmer, when did you call Hewitt?

26:34.886 --> 26:39.766
- Last night, around midnight. Why?
- He might have recorded it.

26:39.933 --> 26:43.520
Michelle, can you filter the audio files
by time and date?

26:43.687 --> 26:46.273
Let me see. Yeah.

26:46.439 --> 26:52.946
Find an audio file that was recorded late last
night or early this morning, around midnight.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.617
This must be it.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.162
- Hello?
- Alex Hewitt?

27:01.329 --> 27:02.998
- Who's this?
- That's him.

27:03.164 --> 27:06.376
- Sherry Palmer.
- We have to let it run.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.586
What are you calling me for?

27:08.753 --> 27:12.716
I know all about your relationship
with Peter Kingsley.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.592
I don't know him.

27:14.759 --> 27:18.096
I also know you had all his
phone conversations recorded.

27:18.263 --> 27:24.728
Let me ask you. Was that to protect
yourself or to blackmail him?

27:24.894 --> 27:28.106
It's OK, Alex.

27:28.273 --> 27:31.359
- I'm here to help you.
- Who says I need help?

27:31.526 --> 27:34.946
Peter thought you'd die in Los Angeles
with everybody else today.

27:35.113 --> 27:39.534
Now that you haven't,
he's gonna come after you.

27:39.701 --> 27:43.163
So listen to me, and I can protect you.

27:43.330 --> 27:46.249
We have enough material
to create a phonetic template.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.044
- Good. What do we do?
- Open up a.gen file

27:49.210 --> 27:51.796
and type in the phrases we want voiced.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.507
What do you mean, open a.gen file?

27:54.674 --> 27:59.846
He created a separate module for playback.
We have to find what menu it's under.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.266
- What am I looking for?
- It's not here.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.519
Try a subroutine called Prologue.

28:06.686 --> 28:10.398
- It's this one.
- They've found me, Jack.

28:10.565 --> 28:13.109
It's loading. What am I looking for now?

28:13.276 --> 28:16.029
A playback graphic interface.
They're almost here.

28:16.196 --> 28:20.950
- Come out of the van.
- Hold on, Michelle. Hold on.

28:21.951 --> 28:25.121
- Ma'am, hands off the keyboard.
- I've got it. Michelle.

28:25.288 --> 28:28.166
Do we take her in?

28:29.876 --> 28:33.880
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.160
- Hello, Heather.
- Mr President.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.915
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Heather.

29:21.386 --> 29:25.265
- Mr President, we're ready.
- David.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.809
I realise how awkward this is.

29:27.976 --> 29:31.563
I hope Mike has told you
how much we appreciate your help.

29:31.729 --> 29:37.861
Make no mistake. I believe
you're making a gross and tragic error.

29:38.027 --> 29:42.157
I'm doing this for the men in those planes.

29:48.163 --> 29:52.208
We're ready here. Patch in the prime minister.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.672
- Mr Prime Minister.
- Hello, Mr President.

29:57.839 --> 30:01.384
I've been trying to reach you for some time.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.243
Hello?

30:37.003 --> 30:39.547
Hello?

31:13.540 --> 31:16.876
- Who are you?
- I'm Kate Warner.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.921
Your father sent me to come get you.

31:20.088 --> 31:22.674
How do I know that?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.801
OK.

31:24.968 --> 31:30.390
You shot a man who came in here
to attack you. It was self-defence.

31:31.391 --> 31:38.106
Your father, Jack Bauer, called me,
asked me to come get you, take you to CTU.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.067
How else would I know all of that?

31:43.444 --> 31:46.698
How do you know my dad?
Do you work at CTU?

31:46.864 --> 31:51.786
No. My family was involved
with what happened today.

31:51.953 --> 31:57.458
Why would my dad send someone
he'd just met to come get me? Huh?

31:58.626 --> 32:00.712
He trusts me.

32:03.631 --> 32:06.426
Come on, Kim.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.845
It's OK.

32:17.228 --> 32:23.067
The sooner we leave, the sooner
you and your dad can be together, OK?

32:56.267 --> 33:00.355
What do you think they'll charge us with?

33:00.521 --> 33:04.692
They could push for treason if they wanted to.

33:04.859 --> 33:06.569
Think they will?

33:06.736 --> 33:11.282
Depends on how big of an example
they wanna make of us.

33:13.826 --> 33:20.291
Look, Michelle, no one can prove that you
knew what I was gonna do to Chappelle.

33:20.458 --> 33:26.756
I'm gonna tell them that you were
helping Jack under my orders, all right?

33:28.466 --> 33:30.927
No.

33:31.094 --> 33:33.554
What do you mean, no?

33:33.721 --> 33:37.850
I did what I thought was right.
I still believe that.

33:39.268 --> 33:42.188
And I won't let you lie for me.

34:24.230 --> 34:29.110
Thank you. I know how difficult
it must have been for you.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.281
How much longer will Prescott keep me here?

34:33.447 --> 34:35.533
Until after the press conference.

34:35.699 --> 34:41.748
I've requested you be released sooner,
but there's only so much I can do.

34:44.250 --> 34:49.797
I spoke to Brian. He requested some
low-security access on your behalf.

34:49.964 --> 34:53.092
I wanted you to know I granted it.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.759
So what's going on with you and my dad?

35:34.926 --> 35:36.969
Excuse me?

35:38.304 --> 35:42.350
Out of everyone he could have called,
he called you.

35:42.517 --> 35:45.394
There's gotta be a reason.

35:46.270 --> 35:50.608
I don't think he trusts very many people.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.861
He trusts you.

35:57.949 --> 36:04.080
- Is it true you guys just met today?
- Yesterday really, but yeah, it is.

36:08.709 --> 36:14.340
I don't resent it or anything.
I just want him to be happy.

36:15.842 --> 36:19.303
It's been a long time.

36:20.847 --> 36:23.766
Since you lost your mother?

36:25.852 --> 36:27.937
Yeah.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.277
I lost my mother too.

36:35.778 --> 36:38.698
When I was about your age.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.205
I really don't think I can do this.

36:46.372 --> 36:53.170
You'll do fine. Just tell him everything
I told you to say. Make the call.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.927
Understood.

37:02.179 --> 37:05.099
Still no sign of Hewitt.

37:12.023 --> 37:13.733
Yes?

37:13.900 --> 37:16.819
It's Sherry Palmer, Peter.

37:16.986 --> 37:20.823
- Are we on a secure line?
- Of course we are.

37:20.990 --> 37:26.370
I want the tapes that you made of
our conversation, the original DATs.

37:26.537 --> 37:32.293
- Why would I give you those?
- Because I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.

37:32.460 --> 37:35.755
- You've found Hewitt?
- That's right.

37:37.715 --> 37:39.759
Where is he?

37:39.926 --> 37:41.969
Don't insult my intelligence.

37:42.136 --> 37:47.725
Agree to the exchange, then you can
do whatever you want with him.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.646
I want to talk to him.

37:51.812 --> 37:58.027
You'll have to hold on. My bodyguard
has him restrained in the next room.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.703
All right, Alex, you can talk.

38:09.330 --> 38:13.834
It's not what you think. They came in here
with guns and threatened to kill me.

38:14.001 --> 38:17.463
I didn't tell them anything
about you, I swear, please.

38:17.630 --> 38:21.342
Who's been there, Alex?
Who have you told about this?

38:21.509 --> 38:26.430
- Do we have a deal or not?
- Not until I know what's going on there.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.641
Give me Alex back.

38:28.808 --> 38:34.021
I'm not gonna keep this call going on
so that you can trace it. Is it yes or no?

38:34.188 --> 38:38.192
Look, this is an ultimatum, Mrs Palmer.

38:38.359 --> 38:42.279
You put Alex back on,
or this conversation is ended.

38:42.446 --> 38:46.492
You force my hand and
I'll make sure Hewitt tells his story

38:46.659 --> 38:48.661
to as many people as possible.

38:48.828 --> 38:51.914
It's your final chance, Mrs Palmer.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.714
Then it's goodbye, Peter.

39:04.677 --> 39:06.637
Fine.

39:06.804 --> 39:08.806
Let's do this.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.183
- Neutral ground.
- All right.

39:11.350 --> 39:15.062
LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.

39:15.229 --> 39:19.442
- Just you and Alex.
- All right.

39:21.861 --> 39:26.198
Very good work, Mrs Palmer. Let's go.

39:30.745 --> 39:33.581
Sherry Palmer has Hewitt.

39:33.748 --> 39:36.417
What does she want?

39:37.793 --> 39:41.297
I get this feeling I'm being set up.

39:43.716 --> 39:47.428
Hewitt's just the bait
to draw me out into the open.

39:47.595 --> 39:50.097
So what are you gonna do?

39:50.264 --> 39:52.725
I don't have any choice.
I have to play this out.

39:52.892 --> 39:55.519
Scott'll have shooters in place.

39:55.686 --> 40:02.526
Sherry Palmer and whoever else she's
involved with in this won't leave there alive.

40:02.693 --> 40:06.405
And then I'm heading outta the country.

40:08.699 --> 40:11.786
Time to roll things up around here.

40:11.952 --> 40:13.954
Now.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.290
Is there anything I can do for you?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.501
You've already done so much.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.420
I'll see you in Lisbon next week.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.565
I am enormously grateful.

40:58.707 --> 41:01.961
- What support will you get from CTU?
- As of now, none.

41:02.128 --> 41:06.465
Wait. You don't expect to take Kingsley down
by yourself? That's insane.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.468
When Kingsley incriminates himself,
CTU will help.

41:09.635 --> 41:13.389
- By then it'll be too late.
- Sorry, that's how it's gonna be.

41:13.556 --> 41:19.520
Kingsley will have people with him who will
kill us when they realise we don't have Hewitt.

41:20.813 --> 41:23.065
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

41:23.232 --> 41:26.861
- No, you're not. Pull over.
- We don't have time.

41:27.027 --> 41:29.321
We've gotta keep moving.
