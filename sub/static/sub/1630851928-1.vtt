THE FIRST SYMBOL IN WHICH WE RECOGNIZE
HUMANITY IS IN THE BURIALS - JACQUES LACAN

00:29.000 --> 00:31.560
<i>The only thing we want is to bury Marta.</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:35.600
<i>We cannot live</i>
<i>without knowing where she is rotting.</i>

00:35.680 --> 00:37.440
JANUARY 24, 2009

00:37.520 --> 00:41.000
<i>They thought it was simply a missing girl,</i>

00:42.480 --> 00:44.280
<i>but here we are, her father and I,</i>

00:45.080 --> 00:48.240
<i>and as long as there</i>
<i>is a Del Castillo Casanueva left alive,</i>

00:48.320 --> 00:49.600
<i>this will not stand.</i>

00:59.720 --> 01:01.920
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

01:47.280 --> 01:50.800
I haven't counted how many letters
of support we've received.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.360
However, in case I decide
to start replying again

01:55.440 --> 01:59.120
to all the people
who have shown their support,

01:59.200 --> 02:02.320
I've marked the ones
I've replied to as "answered."

02:03.560 --> 02:06.400
ANSWERED

02:06.480 --> 02:08.000
And then, one day, well,

02:08.080 --> 02:12.160
I decided to write everything down
so that I'd never forget,

02:12.880 --> 02:17.640
although I don't really need to read this
to know what happened that day.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.400
But I decided to write it down.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.880
"Saturday, January 24th, 2009."

02:27.960 --> 02:31.240
"Antonio and I got up early.
It was 9:00 a.m."

02:31.320 --> 02:33.080
"I prepared breakfast."

02:33.160 --> 02:36.640
"Since it was Saturday,
it was time to change the bedsheets,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.160
and Marta helped me."

02:38.240 --> 02:39.680
"She was happy that day."

02:39.760 --> 02:43.200
"She couldn't stop talking about her plans
for that Saturday afternoon."

02:44.120 --> 02:45.560
EVA CASANUEVA
MARTA'S MOTHER

02:45.640 --> 02:48.640
She told me,
"Mom, I don't know what to do today,

02:48.720 --> 02:52.000
whether I should go with my school friends
to Nervión," which is a mall.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.720
"I don't know whether
to meet up with Gabi and Carlos."

02:54.800 --> 02:58.400
"Later, I'm meeting up with Pitu,"
who is Cristina.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.480
"We wanted to go to Triana
to visit an embroidery workshop."

03:01.560 --> 03:06.600
Since Christmas was over,
she now only cared about Holy Week.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.400
<i>Little by little, the right forwards</i>
<i>and the left backwards.</i>

03:13.440 --> 03:14.920
<i>Good, Xavi, good.</i>

03:16.880 --> 03:21.240
But she was a total fan
of the Hermandad de los Gitanos.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.400
The "Marcha de la Saeta" song…

03:24.280 --> 03:26.000
She played that one all the time.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.040
My father came,
and since she was very demanding,

03:36.120 --> 03:39.200
she said, "Grandpa,
can I have my allowance, a little money?"

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
"I want to buy…"

03:40.360 --> 03:43.080
"It's kind of like a chimney
and you put incense in it."

03:43.880 --> 03:47.000
JOSÉ ANTONIO CASANUEVA
MARTA'S GRANDFATHER

03:47.080 --> 03:50.280
"How much?" I asked her. She said,
"Grandpa, only five or six euros."

03:50.360 --> 03:54.920
And I said, "No, buy a can of tomatoes
and put the incense in there," jokingly.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.040
She lit it, and I said,
"Marta, for God's sake,

04:00.120 --> 04:01.960
it's still only January."

04:02.040 --> 04:05.080
"What are you doing with the incense
and processional marches?"

04:05.160 --> 04:08.640
She told me, "Mom,
I can't wait for April 4th to arrive."

04:08.720 --> 04:09.800
That was Palm Sunday.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.160
She started to get ready.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.800
I asked her, "What did you decide?"
"I'm meeting Pitu."

04:17.560 --> 04:19.720
I said, "Who's that?"
And she said it was Migue.

04:21.880 --> 04:25.320
"Migue? What's he doing here now?"

04:25.400 --> 04:27.280
She said, "I need to clear something up."

04:30.520 --> 04:32.400
Miguel and Marta knew each other

04:32.480 --> 04:36.040
because Miguel's niece
went to the same school.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.960
SAN JUAN BOSCO SCHOOL

04:38.040 --> 04:39.880
And he seemed to like Marta,

04:39.960 --> 04:44.520
and so he started to woo her, as they say.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.800
And Marta liked him, too, evidently.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.440
She was with him for a month and a half.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.880
They started seeing each other
during Holy Week

04:53.960 --> 04:55.720
and broke up after the Fair.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.160
She told me, "Mom, we broke up
because he's very jealous,

05:00.240 --> 05:03.200
very controlling, and I don't…"

05:03.760 --> 05:06.400
I know my daughter
was still in love with him,

05:06.480 --> 05:09.240
but her head prevailed
over her heart.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.600
JANUARY 24, 2009 - 5:30 p.m.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.840
YES, YES. SO…

05:16.640 --> 05:18.000
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TODAY?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.240
I'M GETTING DRESSED. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH

05:25.360 --> 05:28.880
GURL, I HAVE TO GO. MIGUEL IS DOWNSTAIRS
AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.040
I'LL CALL YOU LATER
AND WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. I LOVE YOU.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.800
SEND

05:37.880 --> 05:40.400
I said, "Tell me about it later."
She said, "Okay."

05:41.720 --> 05:44.480
I watched her walk out the door.
"See you later, Mom."

05:44.560 --> 05:45.440
And,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.200
that was the last time I saw her.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.400
I was coming back from shopping.
It was 5:30 p.m.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.360
I was carrying lots of bags,

06:06.440 --> 06:09.000
and she was in the doorway
talking to Miguel.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I saw Miguel's motorcycle,

06:14.080 --> 06:17.200
and I told her that I didn't want
to see her riding a motorcycle.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.280
That was the only thing I told her
that afternoon.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.560
She made the wrong choice that day.

06:46.800 --> 06:52.960
She'd normally give us a call.
And that afternoon, she didn't.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.760
My wife began calling her,

06:54.840 --> 06:56.320
but she wouldn't pick up.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.240
It would go straight to voicemail.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.960
<i>The Orange phone you are calling</i>

07:01.040 --> 07:03.720
<i>is switched off</i>
<i>or out of range at this time.</i>

07:03.800 --> 07:06.760
I had a feeling
that something wasn't right.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.400
It felt like something had happened.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.240
Something… It was very strange.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.640
LORENA DEL CASTILLO
MARTA'S SISTER

07:13.720 --> 07:17.160
I had a gut feeling and thought,
"My sister's not coming back."

07:18.160 --> 07:19.720
Because it was very strange

07:20.200 --> 07:21.880
that she wouldn't answer her phone.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.680
And I thought,

07:25.760 --> 07:29.080
"Something's happened to my sister.
My sister isn't coming back."

07:33.520 --> 07:35.200
<i>The Orange phone you are calling</i>

07:35.280 --> 07:38.080
<i>is switched off</i>
<i>or out of range at this time.</i>

07:40.440 --> 07:42.760
<i>The Orange phone you are calling is--</i>

07:46.880 --> 07:50.360
"From 9:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m,
we called Marta,

07:50.440 --> 07:52.040
but she wouldn't answer."

07:52.520 --> 07:56.480
"At about 10:00 p.m.,
I called her again. No answer."

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
"At 10:34 p.m., I called Marta.
No answer."

08:01.840 --> 08:03.080
"I called her friends."

08:04.040 --> 08:05.520
CRISTIAN BAZO
MARTA'S FRIEND

08:05.600 --> 08:08.120
Eva called me. "Marta hasn't come home."

08:08.200 --> 08:09.240
"Where's Marta?"

08:09.320 --> 08:13.200
Your daughter, who is so good, who always
calls you, is missing late at night?

08:13.280 --> 08:14.760
Something's wrong.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.640
He said she'd been in the little square
and left with Miguel on the motorcycle.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.080
I called Samuel
and heard music in the background.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.440
The first thing I thought,
"This kid is at a nightclub."

08:32.320 --> 08:35.560
I told him, "Marta hasn't come home."

08:35.640 --> 08:37.920
"I know she's been with Miguel,

08:38.560 --> 08:42.440
but I don't have
a phone number to call him."

08:42.520 --> 08:46.240
He says, "Oh, yes, I've spoken to him,
but I don't know anything."

08:46.320 --> 08:49.440
"The only thing he told me
is that he left Marta at 12 o'clock."

08:49.520 --> 08:52.000
Then, I noticed
my husband went like this

08:52.080 --> 08:53.960
and said, "It's not 12 o'clock yet."

08:58.080 --> 09:00.000
<i>While half of Spain is freezing,</i>

09:00.080 --> 09:02.240
<i>Andalusia is suffering</i>
<i>because of the rain.</i>

09:02.320 --> 09:05.320
<i>Heavy rainfall</i>
<i>has caused flooding in Seville.</i>

09:05.400 --> 09:07.800
<i>Up to 80 liters per square meter…</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:09.080
EMPLOYMENT RATE PLUMMETS

09:11.960 --> 09:16.440
The night of the 24th,
I recall it as a nightmare.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.160
ALEJANDRA PORTILLO
MARTA'S FRIEND

09:19.240 --> 09:22.160
Eva called me and told me
to give her Miguel's phone number

09:22.920 --> 09:24.480
because Marta hadn't come home.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.160
I immediately called Miguel.
He wouldn't answer the phone.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.280
And when I talked to Samuel,
he told me that he was in Montequinto,

09:32.360 --> 09:34.640
that he didn't know anything about Miguel.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.000
9 MILES

09:36.080 --> 09:37.680
Oddly, when I called Cuco…

09:38.320 --> 09:41.560
When I called Cuco, he sounded drunk.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.840
There was a lot of noise.
It was very strange.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.520
He knew absolutely nothing about Miguel.
Nobody had seen him.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.640
I thought, "That's strange.
The three of them are always together."

09:52.720 --> 09:54.320
But nobody had seen anybody.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.200
VIRGEN MACARENA HOSPITAL - 11:30 p.m.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.400
Then I went to the Macarena Hospital,

10:06.480 --> 10:10.160
because the first thing I thought
was that she'd had an accident,

10:10.240 --> 10:11.840
that she got on the motorcycle,

10:12.920 --> 10:14.640
and something might have happened.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.080
They said they couldn't
give me any information.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.480
I went back home

10:23.560 --> 10:26.760
and my wife said to me,
"Antonio, did you go by Miguel's house?"

10:26.840 --> 10:28.240
And I told her, "No…"

10:28.320 --> 10:32.680
"Why don't you drop by Leon XIII?
Go there. It's on the ground floor."

10:32.760 --> 10:37.400
"See if there's a light on or something.
Maybe she's gone to his house."

10:37.480 --> 10:38.600
"I don't know."

10:39.120 --> 10:40.640
"Look, just go have a look."

10:43.840 --> 10:45.120
12:45 a.m.

10:45.200 --> 10:49.600
In the only window that was lit,
there was a man watching television,

10:49.680 --> 10:51.640
and to make sure,

10:52.160 --> 10:56.120
I knocked on the window
and asked him, "Miguel lives here, right?"

10:56.200 --> 10:58.280
He said, "Yes, it's the window next door."

10:58.360 --> 11:01.440
It was all dark. The blind was down.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.800
I knocked on it.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.920
But it was all dark.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.760
And the blind was down.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.720
Miguel had several phone numbers.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.080
I think Eva had one or two numbers,

11:21.160 --> 11:23.720
and the friends gave her some others.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.720
Finally, I got a hold of Miguel.

11:28.800 --> 11:33.200
I said, "Good evening, Miguel.
I'm Marta's mother."

11:33.280 --> 11:37.280
"Marta hasn't come home,
and I know she's been with you."

11:38.920 --> 11:42.080
And he said, "No, no.
I left her by the glass shop."

11:42.160 --> 11:43.760
DIMA GLASS SHOP

11:49.440 --> 11:51.840
MARTA'S DOOR

11:51.920 --> 11:53.080
I thought, "No."

11:53.160 --> 11:57.280
And that's when I felt fury, rage, fear...

11:57.360 --> 12:00.960
I don't know,
many feelings at the same time.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.600
And then I said,
"No, I need to solve this."

12:04.680 --> 12:05.760
So I called back.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.640
I said, "Look here, Miguel,

12:11.720 --> 12:15.240
if my daughter doesn't come home,
I have a family member who's an officer,

12:15.320 --> 12:17.040
and the police will be all over you."

12:17.120 --> 12:20.160
"She's only 17 years old
and she's a minor."

12:22.840 --> 12:24.080
"I'm not going to…"

12:28.680 --> 12:29.880
Just a moment.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.440
And he simply answered, "Okay."

12:39.800 --> 12:41.160
And he hung up the phone.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.800
At that point,

12:48.880 --> 12:52.280
we organized ourselves
the best we could and went to find Marta.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.080
I literally put a jacket on
over my pajamas, my boots,

12:58.160 --> 12:59.840
and we went down to Seville.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.880
Not knowing what to do,
where to go, nothing…

13:05.960 --> 13:08.160
We were lost,
stumbling around in the dark.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.720
It was a very cold night.
The weather was horrible.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.040
The first thing we decided was,
"Let's go to Miguel's house."

13:26.800 --> 13:28.280
My friend, his father and I go.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.440
I lifted the blind. Everything was dark.
I couldn't see any light.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.920
You know something isn't right.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.960
You know you're nervous.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.520
But what matters most to you
is knowing what's happened to your friend.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.880
We went to Cartuja

13:47.960 --> 13:51.480
and wandered around the river basin,
shouting her name everywhere.

13:51.560 --> 13:55.600
I remember I was sitting by the window
of my mother's car shouting "Marta"

13:55.680 --> 14:00.800
in case she had fallen
or was disoriented…

14:00.880 --> 14:02.040
I was overwhelmed.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.200
I went to file a report
because my daughter didn't turn up,

14:10.280 --> 14:13.200
so I filed a missing person's report.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.280
DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR THE POLICE
NERVIÓN DIVISION

14:15.360 --> 14:18.400
DISAPPEARANCE OF:
MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASANUEVA

14:18.480 --> 14:21.080
The police told me,

14:21.160 --> 14:24.240
"She's probably partying
or sleeping over at a friend's house."

14:25.720 --> 14:28.320
I wasn't going to argue with them.

14:28.400 --> 14:32.720
I filed the report,
but those words really bothered me.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.440
MIGUEL LEFT HER AT AROUND 9:30 p.m.
SAMUEL SAID MIGUEL LEFT HER AT 12:00

14:36.520 --> 14:38.640
AND THAT JAVI WAS WITH HER
THAT AFTERNOON.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.240
That night, no officers searched with us.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.560
What mattered most to me
at that moment was finding Marta.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.120
I wanted to find her. Period.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.200
With a photo in my hand,
I asked around the industrial park,

14:54.280 --> 14:57.040
the nightclubs,
asking groups of young people…

14:57.600 --> 15:01.200
The whole downtown area:
Torneo, Chapina, Cartuja…

15:01.280 --> 15:04.320
We also went
to the Nervión neighborhood, just in case.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.840
And then we went directly
to the Triana area.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.400
There, we gathered
at the Plaza del Altozano.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.560
Samuel joined us.

15:15.040 --> 15:20.600
We saw him arrive with wet hair
and a very thin sweater.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.440
It was a very cold night…

15:22.520 --> 15:25.080
And the first thing we thought was,

15:25.160 --> 15:26.480
"Where is he coming from?"

15:26.560 --> 15:28.360
He said, "I've just been running."

15:28.440 --> 15:31.920
We thought that was bizarre
because it was very cold that night.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.480
We were eager to speak to Miguel,

15:36.560 --> 15:39.280
but he wouldn't answer
any of the numbers we called.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.840
So then I called Miguel's brother,

15:48.920 --> 15:52.720
hoping to get a new phone number
to contact Miguel.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.680
In the beginning, Francisco Javier
was totally willing to help.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.920
He was very involved.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.280
He didn't want to give me
his brother's number,

16:03.360 --> 16:05.400
but said, "Don't worry, I'll talk to him."

16:05.480 --> 16:06.560
Fine.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.760
No more than five minutes later,

16:11.280 --> 16:13.800
he said he'd talked to his brother

16:13.880 --> 16:18.000
and he said that he'd left Marta
by the glass shop, and that was all.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.200
DIMA GLASS SHOP

16:20.280 --> 16:22.800
We had nowhere else to look.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.120
And when we went past the street
where Miguel and his brother lived,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.640
Alejandra said,
"Mom, that's Miguel's motorcycle."

16:40.720 --> 16:42.360
As soon as I saw the motorcycle,

16:42.440 --> 16:44.000
something didn't feel right.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.440
"Let's wake up the brother."

16:47.080 --> 16:48.560
We rang the doorbell.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.400
Francisco Javier answered,

16:50.480 --> 16:53.520
opened the door and asked us to come in.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.040
I wanted to go in and turn everything
upside down until I found her.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.160
But the parents walked in,

16:59.240 --> 17:01.240
my mother and someone else's father...

17:01.320 --> 17:03.200
And Miguel came out with him.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.760
He had his head like this…

17:04.840 --> 17:07.520
"Miguel, where did you leave Marta?
At what time?"

17:07.600 --> 17:11.440
And, of course, since he was quiet,
his brother spoke up.

17:11.520 --> 17:15.480
He said, "He says
he left her by the glass shop."

17:15.560 --> 17:18.720
This isn't right, not at all.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.320
Why isn't he talking?
Why was the other one speaking for him?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.600
I told them, "Let's go."

17:24.880 --> 17:27.000
The first thing she said
when she came out,

17:27.080 --> 17:29.160
"Alejandra, that house stinks of bleach."

17:30.200 --> 17:32.960
The smell was very strong.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.760
I thought, "That's bad."

17:39.360 --> 17:41.360
So, that really made me suspicious,

17:41.440 --> 17:44.680
and we went to file an extension
of the initial report.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.280
And I told the police
that she had gone out with a friend

17:48.800 --> 17:50.000
named Miguel Carcaño

17:50.760 --> 17:53.160
who lived in León XIII,

17:53.760 --> 17:56.680
and I even gave them
all of Miguel Carcaño's phone numbers.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.200
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GIVEN

17:58.280 --> 18:02.280
REGARDING THE PERSON WHO LAST SAW
AND WAS WITH HIS DAUGHTER

18:02.360 --> 18:06.400
But they told me,
"We'll pick this up on Monday."

18:07.200 --> 18:08.800
I said, "What do you mean, Monday?"

18:09.600 --> 18:11.520
"Don't the police work on weekends?"

18:13.360 --> 18:16.040
JANUARY 25 - 1:00 p.m. - 15 HOURS MISSING

18:16.120 --> 18:17.760
I came across a police car

18:17.840 --> 18:22.280
and asked them,
"Are you looking for a missing girl?"

18:22.360 --> 18:24.840
I showed them the photograph
and they said,

18:24.920 --> 18:28.840
"We don't know anything
about a missing girl."

18:33.960 --> 18:35.680
What you feel is anguish.

18:37.880 --> 18:42.320
You don't think about how you feel,
but rather, "What do I do?"

18:43.200 --> 18:44.200
"What should I do?"

18:45.400 --> 18:46.320
"Where can I go?"

18:47.840 --> 18:48.760
Because…

18:49.640 --> 18:50.560
"Where should I go?"

18:54.400 --> 18:59.200
I went to my sister's house,
and when I opened the door,

18:59.280 --> 19:00.960
what I saw was Dantesque.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.720
I will never forget
my sister sitting there

19:03.800 --> 19:06.040
and Marta's two sisters, two little girls,

19:06.120 --> 19:09.120
trembling, crying,
with their faces distorted.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.680
That image was terrible.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.720
Since Miguel Carcaño
was the last person who had seen her,

19:19.800 --> 19:22.080
I decided to return.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.680
Two of Marta's friends came along.
We parked in the area.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.000
They then told me,
"Look, this is Miguel's brother's car."

19:42.480 --> 19:45.840
I rang the doorbell repeatedly.
No one opened the door or answered.

19:46.640 --> 19:51.120
I rang other doorbells
and identified myself. "Can you open up?"

19:51.200 --> 19:53.560
"I'm the uncle of a girl
who has disappeared,

19:53.640 --> 19:55.600
and we need to talk to Miguel Carcaño."

19:56.400 --> 19:57.600
They opened the door.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
I asked,

19:59.920 --> 20:03.240
"Does Miguel Carcaño live here?
Have you seen him lately?"

20:04.040 --> 20:08.320
The guy told me, "Well, I saw
Miguel Carcaño yesterday,

20:09.080 --> 20:12.080
and it was a bit strange
because it was early in the morning,

20:12.720 --> 20:15.280
and he had a wheelchair with him."

20:24.240 --> 20:25.440
It broke me up inside.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.840
I thought, "Something has happened here.
This was not a voluntary disappearance."

20:33.160 --> 20:35.080
I persisted, knocking on the door.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.160
At that moment, I heard the latch open.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.760
I didn't realize it was
Miguel Carcaño's brother.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.800
I didn't know Miguel or his brother.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.760
He opened the door
in a rather aggressive way.

20:48.320 --> 20:53.720
And he asked me
what the hell was going on, insulting me.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.600
I told him, "Look, pardon me."

20:55.680 --> 20:58.880
"I'm Marta del Castillo's uncle,
the girl who disappeared."

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Then I noticed that he calmed down,

21:01.080 --> 21:03.640
lowered the intensity,
and he said, "Come in."

21:03.720 --> 21:06.200
He closed the door
and left the kids outside.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.840
He simply told me that his brother
had left Marta by her door,

21:13.920 --> 21:17.880
that his brother had gone back to Camas
and that he didn't know anything else.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.800
I left and went to my sister's
with that information.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.120
I asked him, "Javi, what happened?"

21:24.200 --> 21:25.200
He said…

21:26.200 --> 21:30.160
He said, "I have a very bad feeling.
A really bad feeling."

21:30.920 --> 21:33.040
I collapsed, I started to cry…

21:35.560 --> 21:39.400
My girls were still there,
so I didn't want to sob.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.440
I didn't want to…

21:42.040 --> 21:44.720
And what I wanted
was for my girls to leave the house.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.240
My aunt, like…

21:50.200 --> 21:53.760
she took both my sister and I
out of that nightmare,

21:54.680 --> 21:58.240
so that we wouldn't suffer or know…

21:59.640 --> 22:01.840
what was happening at that time.

22:02.480 --> 22:06.640
They told him that Miguel
had been seen with a wheelchair.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.240
That alarmed us.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.920
NATIONAL POLICE

22:13.000 --> 22:17.080
1:30 p.m.
11 HOURS SINCE THE FIRST REPORT

22:17.160 --> 22:20.760
We went to file a third report at 1:30.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.440
There was new evidence
that had been discovered,

22:24.520 --> 22:25.760
which was the wheelchair,

22:25.840 --> 22:28.720
and this was a very important detail.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.000
POLICE

22:31.080 --> 22:33.560
The officer handling
the complaint this time said,

22:33.640 --> 22:37.600
"Well, I'll call the room
to see if they pick up the phone."

22:37.680 --> 22:39.880
"But it's bad timing,
they're changing shifts."

22:39.960 --> 22:44.120
Not giving this type of case priority
showed a terrible lack of sensitivity.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.000
all of us were asking questions on Tuenti
in case anyone had seen her that day,

22:58.080 --> 23:01.600
in case anyone knew anything about her,
anything at all, whatever it might be.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.320

7:00 p.m.
17 HOURS SINCE THE FIRST REPORT

23:36.840 --> 23:42.360
Back at home, we decided
to watch Miguel Carcaño's door.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.560
"Let's see if he comes out,
if he doesn't, whatever's going on…"

23:49.080 --> 23:54.640
<i>On the 25th at 7:15 p.m.,</i>
<i>Homicide Department received a call</i>

23:54.720 --> 23:55.880
<i>on Sunday evening.</i>

23:55.960 --> 23:57.800
<i>I was informed of a disappearance</i>

23:57.880 --> 24:02.440
<i>and that the girl's parents</i>
<i>were in front of a certain building,</i>

24:02.520 --> 24:04.960
<i>thinking that the girl was inside,</i>

24:05.040 --> 24:07.760
<i>or that someone inside</i>
<i>could provide information.</i>

24:07.840 --> 24:11.720
<i>So, I decide to at least check</i>
<i>if the girl was inside.</i>

24:11.800 --> 24:14.000
<i>It took me less than 15 minutes</i>
<i>to get there.</i>

24:14.840 --> 24:17.760
And that's when the first
national police officer appeared.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.920
He said, "I'm from the Homicide Division."

24:20.000 --> 24:21.720
"In theory, from tomorrow,

24:21.800 --> 24:25.280
the division that deals with minors
will be handling this case."

24:25.360 --> 24:29.840
"But I'll do the initial investigation.
I'll go in and talk to them."

24:33.320 --> 24:36.120
The person who was there
at that time was María Mendaro,

24:36.200 --> 24:39.440
who was in a relationship
with Miguel Carcaño's brother.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.040
<i>María García Mendaro</i>
<i>told me she knew nothing</i>

24:50.120 --> 24:52.880
<i>about Marta del Castillo</i>
<i>having been inside the house.</i>

24:52.960 --> 24:56.440
<i>She told me that</i>
<i>she had been there all night on the 24th,</i>

24:56.520 --> 24:58.320
<i>that she was studying for an exam,</i>

24:58.400 --> 25:02.120
<i>and that she had not left the house</i>
<i>all night until 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.</i>

25:02.200 --> 25:05.120
<i>She gave me that explanation</i>
<i>and that was when I asked her,</i>

25:05.200 --> 25:08.120
<i>"May I take a look around the house?"</i>
<i>She didn't object.</i>

25:08.200 --> 25:09.840
<i>We went in and looked around.</i>

25:09.920 --> 25:12.240
<i>They had cleaned, in my opinion.</i>

25:12.320 --> 25:17.120
<i>I made several calls</i>
<i>to Miguel and his brother Francisco,</i>

25:17.200 --> 25:19.000
<i>but they never picked up the phone.</i>

25:19.080 --> 25:22.720
<i>It is true that at that moment,</i>
<i>it raised certain concerns.</i>

25:28.240 --> 25:30.760
You could say
the police were late to respond.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.520
It took 17 hours
from the time Marta disappeared

25:34.600 --> 25:38.600
until the police first showed up
at the Leon XIII apartment,

25:38.680 --> 25:41.560
although the protocol
for the disappearance of minors

25:41.640 --> 25:44.560
indicates that immediate action
has to be taken,

25:45.240 --> 25:48.320
and those hours that were lost
could have been vital.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.840
MISSING

25:56.920 --> 26:00.680
<i>Seville's Minors' Division</i>
<i>is trying to locate a 17-year-old girl.</i>

26:00.760 --> 26:02.960
<i>She has not been heard from</i>
<i>since Saturday.</i>

26:03.040 --> 26:05.800
<i>She is 17 years old</i>
<i>the eldest of three sisters,</i>

26:05.880 --> 26:07.360
<i>and very family-oriented.</i>

26:07.440 --> 26:10.200
<i>She did not take any clothes</i>
<i>or personal effects.</i>

26:10.280 --> 26:13.080
<i>The police have taken her computer</i>
<i>and her personal diary</i>

26:13.160 --> 26:16.440
<i>in order to find some clue</i>
<i>of either a voluntary escape</i>

26:16.520 --> 26:18.680
<i>or someone forcibly taking her away.</i>

26:21.760 --> 26:25.000
In the office, I remember how
we commented on that news item,

26:25.080 --> 26:27.080
it seemed of little importance at first.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.120
SEARCH FOR A MINOR
MISSING SINCE SATURDAY NIGHT

26:29.200 --> 26:30.680
We thought

26:30.760 --> 26:34.680
it was a 17-year-old female runaway
and that she'd show up.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.400
The senior police chief told me
that a young woman had disappeared

26:40.920 --> 26:43.200
and that according to his experience,

26:44.080 --> 26:46.480
the case gave him a very bad feeling.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.440
This was a missing minor

26:51.520 --> 26:54.120
and, as such,
it was given to the Minors' Division,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.760
whose director at the time was
María Jesús Cervantes.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.840
It was the logical thing to do
at the time,

26:58.920 --> 27:00.480
although later, there were doubts

27:00.560 --> 27:03.080
as to whether
this was really one of the failures,

27:03.160 --> 27:05.520
one of the blunders of the case.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.440

<i>and told me to get involved, that there</i>
<i>had been a disturbing disappearance.</i>

27:14.960 --> 27:17.920
<i>And my colleague</i>
<i>from the Homicide Department</i>

27:18.000 --> 27:20.600
<i>informed me of the steps</i>
<i>he had taken that weekend.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:24.200
<i>The first steps taken</i>
<i>were to contact all the people</i>

<i>who had been with Marta that evening.</i>

27:30.960 --> 27:32.960

27:33.040 --> 27:37.520
They took statements from Miguel Carcaño
and the friends she was with that night.

27:39.240 --> 27:43.560
Miguel Carcaño
was a 19-year-old boy at the time.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.560
He worked as a cleaner.
He used to clean a bingo hall.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.440
In the month of January 2009,

27:50.520 --> 27:53.400
Miguel was living in Camas
at his girlfriend's house,

27:53.480 --> 27:56.200
or rather,
at his girlfriend's family's house,

27:56.280 --> 27:58.400
because his girlfriend, Rocío,

27:58.480 --> 28:00.480
was only 14 years old.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.680
That would be inconceivable now,

28:03.760 --> 28:08.480
that a 14-year-old minor would live
with a 19-year-old boy in the family home.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.720
But for Miguel Carcaño, it was something
that was absolutely natural to him.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.480
ROCÍO AND MIGUE
I LOVE U, PRINCESS

28:21.240 --> 28:23.680
MIGUEL'S VERSION

28:23.760 --> 28:24.600
ARGANTONIO ST.

28:24.680 --> 28:29.840
Miguel Carcaño, in his first statement,
says that he picked Marta up at her door,

28:29.920 --> 28:32.840
he was in the square with her
and the rest of his friends,

28:32.920 --> 28:34.200
including "El Cuco,"

28:35.040 --> 28:36.720
and that later, by motorcycle,

28:36.800 --> 28:40.400
they went to Triana to meet
with a friend of his, an embroiderer.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.040
And according to Miguel's statement,

28:43.120 --> 28:45.600
first, they were in León XIII,
at his house…

28:47.240 --> 28:48.600
and then he accompanied her

28:48.680 --> 28:51.400
to a nearby glass shop
that was next to Marta's house

28:51.480 --> 28:53.640
and that's where he left her
safe and sound.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.000
He went to where
he was living at the time, in Camas,

28:57.080 --> 28:58.640
with his girlfriend's family,

28:59.640 --> 29:03.080
and the first news he received
of Marta's disappearance

29:03.160 --> 29:07.240
was at ten past midnight, thanks
to the call he received from Samuel.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.760
He says he had no idea
about what happened,

29:12.840 --> 29:15.920
that he had left Marta safe and sound,
near her house,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.200
and he went back to bed.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.680
Around one o'clock, he said

29:22.760 --> 29:26.080
that Eva Casanueva, Marta's mother,
called him for the first time,

29:26.160 --> 29:28.920
and half an hour later,
Eva called him again,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.400
this time much more upset.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.560
And at around 4:20 a.m.,
he got a call from his brother, Javier,

29:35.640 --> 29:38.720
who told him to urgently go
to the apartment in León XIII.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.080
CALL FROM MIGUEL TO JAVIER

29:43.160 --> 29:44.840
<i>-How are you doing?</i>
<i>-What's up?</i>

29:44.920 --> 29:49.960
<i>Apparently, someone says they saw you here</i>
<i>in the hallway, by the door,</i>

29:50.040 --> 29:53.280
<i>at one o'clock at night, on Saturday.</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:55.480
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-At 1:00 a.m.?</i>

29:56.440 --> 29:57.440
<i>Where were you…?</i>

29:57.520 --> 30:01.560
<i>Hey, has your boss been called</i>
<i>to testify and all that stuff?</i>

30:01.640 --> 30:02.560
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:02.640 --> 30:05.120
<i>So, you were in Camas at 1:00 a.m., right?</i>

30:05.200 --> 30:07.360
<i>-Me? Yeah, of course.</i>
<i>-Great, then.</i>

30:12.720 --> 30:17.760
<i>We took the wheelchair</i>
<i>on the afternoon of the 26th,</i>

30:17.840 --> 30:21.240
<i>after taking a witness statement</i>
<i>from Miguel Carcaño's brother.</i>

30:21.320 --> 30:22.560
NPC OFFICER

30:22.640 --> 30:25.360
<i>We asked him</i>
<i>if he would authorize us to go to his home</i>

30:25.440 --> 30:29.880
<i>and pick up the wheelchair,</i>
<i>which the neighbor had said he'd seen.</i>

30:29.960 --> 30:31.880
<i>He authorized us to do so.</i>

30:31.960 --> 30:34.160
<i>The police went and seized the chair,</i>

30:34.240 --> 30:36.480
<i>and they took it to the laboratory</i>
<i>to do their job.</i>

30:41.360 --> 30:43.880
<i>The boy who accompanied Marta home</i>
<i>around 9:30 p.m.</i>

30:43.960 --> 30:46.720
<i>has already been questioned by the police.</i>

30:46.800 --> 30:48.560
<i>It was believed that this young man</i>

30:48.640 --> 30:50.640
<i>was the last to see her that Saturday,</i>

30:50.720 --> 30:54.040
<i>but yesterday, a neighbor recalled</i>
<i>coming across her in the doorway.</i>

30:54.120 --> 30:57.800
She opened the door when she saw us coming
and said, "Hello, Encarni."

30:57.880 --> 31:00.440
And I know it was at 9:30 p.m.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.480
because I was returning from shopping,

31:02.560 --> 31:04.560
and I didn't want to miss
the <i>Copla </i>show.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.800
I said to my husband,
"Phew, it's 9:30 p.m."

31:06.880 --> 31:09.320
So, I knew it was that time,
approximately.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.880
9:35 p.m. - MIGUEL LEAVES MARTA
BY THE GLASS SHOP

31:12.960 --> 31:15.280
<i>...we're live at the </i>Copla Show<i>.</i>

31:15.360 --> 31:20.400
9:35 p.m. - A NEIGHBOR
SEES MARTA IN THE DOORWAY

31:22.200 --> 31:23.080
MIGUEL CALLS JAVIER

31:23.160 --> 31:24.560
<i>-Hey.</i>
<i>-Javi…</i>

31:24.640 --> 31:25.640
<i>What?</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:30.040
<i>The </i>El Diario de Sevilla <i>newspaper</i>
<i>sent me a message on Tuenti.</i>

31:30.120 --> 31:31.920
<i>They want me to contact them.</i>

31:32.000 --> 31:34.160
<i>No, no. Forget about it.</i>

31:34.240 --> 31:38.000
<i>Besides, I saw on TV</i>
<i>that a neighbor saw her</i>

31:38.520 --> 31:41.800
<i>in the doorway</i>
<i>at 9:30 or 9:40 p.m., or so.</i>

31:41.880 --> 31:42.720
<i>Okay.</i>

31:43.240 --> 31:46.520
<i>You know?</i>
<i>Just don't meet with or talk to anyone.</i>

31:46.600 --> 31:48.200
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Do I make myself clear?</i>

31:48.280 --> 31:49.680
<i>Don't talk to anyone.</i>

31:51.840 --> 31:58.040
JANUARY 27, 2009
FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE

32:01.560 --> 32:04.320
Antonio, you've found
the strength to talk to us,

32:04.400 --> 32:06.840
but we know that her mother,
Marta's mother is…

32:06.920 --> 32:08.040
Yes.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.440
She's… She is completely catatonic.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.280
She's in bed, sedated.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.640
She's in bed all day,
takes her pills, and that's it.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.640
She stays in bed and she is…

32:20.720 --> 32:23.520
I came outside…
I was so overwhelmed the first time.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.680
I don't know how many cameras
I saw there. It was overwhelming.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.840
My world fell apart.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.400
During that month and a half,
the only thing I remember is that…

32:35.120 --> 32:36.720
my mother or my mother-in-law…

32:37.800 --> 32:40.920
they would wake me up,
they would make me sit up…

32:41.560 --> 32:44.280
they would give me broth
or baby food to eat.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.280
They would get me up
to go to the bathroom.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.040
Are you happy with the police,

32:51.120 --> 32:53.320
even though
there have been no results yet?

32:53.400 --> 32:56.600
Yes, of course.
The police are doing their best.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.120
Everybody's helping a lot.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.160
And the support you're receiving helps
at such a difficult time?

33:02.240 --> 33:04.280
-It does.
-Well, we'll leave you in peace.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.320
Thank you very much.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.360
There are no instructions
to deal with this,

33:07.440 --> 33:09.840
but it grabs ahold of you, overtakes you,

33:09.920 --> 33:12.320
and you have to do the best you can.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.480
In 2009,
when Marta del Castillo disappeared,

33:18.560 --> 33:20.480
it was just another case, but,

33:20.560 --> 33:22.440
as it progressed,

33:22.520 --> 33:25.360
I developed a personal relationship
with Antonio and Eva,

33:26.360 --> 33:27.920
and it became an obsession.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.960
It is the case of my life.

33:32.920 --> 33:33.760
NEWS

33:33.840 --> 33:37.840
Journalists… everyone we wanted to know.
It became the case that opened the news.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.160
It opened the news.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.880
LA SEXTA NEWS

33:40.960 --> 33:43.760
In Seville, the search continues
for the 17-year-old…

33:43.840 --> 33:46.400
…her whereabouts are unknown.
The family…

33:46.480 --> 33:48.640
…still no information on her whereabouts.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.800
Friends and neighbors
have begun to cover the neighborhood

33:51.880 --> 33:53.840
where she disappeared with her picture.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.920
Can every parent please post
the picture of my daughter on their door,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.040
because this could happen anywhere.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.440
I would go out and see posters everywhere.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.760
In black and white, in color…

34:05.840 --> 34:08.440
There wasn't one house
without Marta's picture on it.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.720
<i>No means to find Marta</i>
<i>have been ruled out.</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:15.160
<i>On social media, search platforms</i>
<i>have already been created.</i>

34:15.240 --> 34:19.000
<i>In one of them, we can see her profile</i>
<i>where she greets her friends,</i>

34:19.080 --> 34:21.800
<i>friends who are now</i>
<i>looking for her relentlessly.</i>

34:21.880 --> 34:25.120
Right now, we don't know who has done it,

34:25.200 --> 34:29.120
what has happened, or what will happen,
and right now, we don't know anything.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.800
We are…

34:30.880 --> 34:32.280
MARTA'S FRIENDS ARE DISTRAUGHT

34:32.360 --> 34:34.920
I don't know. It's really strange.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.560
It can't even be explained.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.560
Each day we grow more anxious, more tired,

34:40.640 --> 34:44.200
but every day that passes is a day closer
to Marta being found, of course.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.920
EMERGENCIES - ANDALUSIA - 15:42

34:46.000 --> 34:49.040
<i>Emergencies 112 Andalusia.</i>
<i>How can I help? What's happened?</i>

34:49.120 --> 34:51.200
<i>I've seen Marta del Castillo.</i>

34:51.280 --> 34:53.080
<i>Where did you see her, sir?</i>

34:53.160 --> 34:55.400
<i>Around Santa Justa, where she lives.</i>

34:56.280 --> 34:58.920
<i>Emergencies 112 Andalusia.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

34:59.000 --> 35:00.680
<i>I know where Marta's body is.</i>

35:00.760 --> 35:02.520
<i>Which Marta?</i>

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
<i>Marta del Castillo.</i>

35:03.680 --> 35:06.440
<i>This is 112 calling.</i>
<i>We received a call from this number</i>

35:06.520 --> 35:08.960
<i>informing us that Marta del Castillo</i>
<i>has been seen.</i>

35:09.040 --> 35:11.200
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-All right, please don't hang up.</i>

35:11.280 --> 35:13.640
<i>We'll transfer you</i>
<i>to the national police force.</i>

35:13.720 --> 35:17.280
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

35:18.040 --> 35:20.400
They called me on the phone and asked me

35:20.480 --> 35:24.760
if I wanted to be the private prosecutor
in the case of Marta del Castillo.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.040
-"The girl everyone's talking about?"
-"Yes."

35:27.120 --> 35:28.280
"Sure, then."

35:30.560 --> 35:34.400
In my case, I had the additional
responsibility of being the liaison

35:34.480 --> 35:37.400
between the police
and Marta del Castillo's family.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.840
The police thought that they had
to inform the family

35:42.920 --> 35:46.360
in a very punctual and continuous way.

35:46.880 --> 35:50.880
At a certain point,
the police might have felt harassed

35:50.960 --> 35:53.760
by the actions or requests of the family,

35:53.840 --> 35:57.520
and the family may have felt the actions
of the police were insufficient.

35:57.600 --> 36:02.880
My daughter is out there and the police
have nothing reliable to go on.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.520
They should be pulling all the strings.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.560
Some will be good,
some will be bad, but…

36:10.800 --> 36:13.600
But they are lost, completely lost.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.640
From the police's point of view,

36:15.720 --> 36:18.080
there was also a concern
about public image.

36:18.680 --> 36:23.440
And then Antonio would sometimes
intervene, publicly,

36:23.520 --> 36:26.920
and that could have
been considered inconvenient,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.120
or that did not favor

36:29.200 --> 36:32.440
the best public image
of the investigation, etcetera.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.000
I'm going to say something…

36:37.400 --> 36:38.560
And I don't know if…

36:39.840 --> 36:42.560
a neighbor heard a scream.
That's it. I can't say more.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.920
If you say how the police are working
and what leads they're following,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.320
you're jeopardizing the investigation.

36:49.400 --> 36:53.360
Therefore, you're harming
Marta's own interest.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.960
The police often blamed me for the fact
that as soon as Marta disappeared,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.840
the cameras were already there.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.360
I didn't call anyone.
No network, no newspaper, no one.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.040
It never occurred to me, either.

37:06.120 --> 37:10.600
What's more, I found out most things
thanks to the media.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.560
They've not explained anything to me.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.800
I found out from you
that they were combing the river

37:15.880 --> 37:18.320
and there were boats and helicopters.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.160
We'll continue to investigate.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.880
There are issues and leads
that we'll continue to examine.

37:22.960 --> 37:26.320
We've searched close to 100 sites,

37:26.400 --> 37:29.200
more sites than
what have been reported by the press.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.600
The police officers
had to face a severe level of pressure,

37:32.680 --> 37:36.960
people in the streets,
parents talking to the media…

37:37.040 --> 37:40.000
Marta del Castillo, Seville is with you!

37:41.440 --> 37:44.480
Marta del Castillo, Seville is with you!

37:45.320 --> 37:46.920
With that pressure,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.600
with the absolutely overwhelming
public backing and support that she had,

37:50.680 --> 37:52.120
this played in her favor,

37:52.200 --> 37:55.080
and they evidently used it
so that the investigation

37:55.160 --> 37:58.320
would not only continue, but
so it would not decline in the slightest.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.360
My daughter's bed is empty,
and we still have no answers.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.520
The culprit is fighting
against the police, who seem to be…

38:05.440 --> 38:07.040
Whoever did this is winning now.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.600
I want you to do everything you can,
that's all I ask.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.320
Also that you put pressure
on the authorities.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.400
Well, the pressure was huge
because it had to be.

38:18.040 --> 38:23.160
It had to be. But the police
also had to be tough enough

38:23.240 --> 38:25.680
to withstand that pressure,

38:26.200 --> 38:27.320
and much more.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.800
I told them many times
that, in this job, we need to man up.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.440
The high-pressure environment…

38:35.640 --> 38:37.880
I'm not going to lie,
we also asked for it.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.720
Because

38:41.400 --> 38:42.720
you know how this works.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.480
Some people, if you don't push them…

38:48.320 --> 38:49.760
they won't lift a finger.

38:52.720 --> 38:57.160
Wait a moment.
Pardon me, are you friends of Marta's?

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
Yes, but…

39:01.160 --> 39:02.720
Please step away from the door.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.200
Absolutely, all the lines were crossed.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.760
It was completely excessive.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.720
The kids were harassed by the media
until they gave interviews.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.040
The public was bombarded
with images of the minors

39:17.120 --> 39:19.840
that they had provided voluntarily,

39:19.920 --> 39:23.280
and also those that journalists
had taken from their Tuenti accounts.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.640
It was a private world
that belonged to the minors.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.280
It overwhelmed us all.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.880
And that also provoked extreme behavior
and mistakes made by the media

39:33.960 --> 39:35.440
in how the case was handled.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.760
We journalists had to learn
the hard way how Tuenti worked,

39:39.840 --> 39:42.200
what Tuenti was, how to access Tuenti…

39:42.280 --> 39:44.520
We all created profiles on Tuenti,

39:44.600 --> 39:46.640
because the lives of the youth

39:46.720 --> 39:52.000
was being openly shown
on that social platform.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.240
There were many photographs
of Marta del Castillo

39:55.320 --> 39:56.560
on that social platform,

39:56.640 --> 39:58.960
where we all logged in
to get to know Marta

39:59.040 --> 40:00.960
and the other protagonists of the story.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.080
Tuenti was a key element.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.840
JUDGE ORDERS THE CLOSURE
OF MARTA DEL CASTILLO'S PROFILE ON TUENTI

40:06.920 --> 40:09.360
I ordered that
the Tuenti profiles be shut down,

40:09.440 --> 40:11.880
but, of course,
the images had already been saved.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.640
<i>What's up?</i>

40:15.720 --> 40:19.320
<i>-Today was your sister-in-law's turn.</i>
<i>-How did it go?</i>

40:19.400 --> 40:22.080
<i>They wanted to ask her about you</i>
<i>and also about me,</i>

40:22.160 --> 40:24.920
<i>maybe in case I'm a bad guy</i>
<i>and I'm covering for you.</i>

40:25.440 --> 40:26.720
<i>It's okay, though.</i>

40:26.800 --> 40:30.760
<i>The poor girl doesn't know anything,</i>
<i>so what's she going to tell them?</i>

40:30.840 --> 40:34.040
<i>She doesn't have a fucking clue,</i>
<i>I swear to fucking God.</i>

40:35.080 --> 40:37.400
<i>Sometimes I'd like</i>
<i>to be less clever, kiddo.</i>

40:38.000 --> 40:41.600
<i>But I knew this was going</i>
<i>to be a big deal. Fuck me.</i>

40:41.680 --> 40:44.480
<i>Don't talk to anyone,</i>
<i>especially not journalists, the fuckers.</i>

40:46.560 --> 40:48.400
JANUARY 30, 2009 - 6 DAYS MISSING

40:48.480 --> 40:52.080
That day, the house was searched

40:52.160 --> 40:55.400
in the presence of Francisco Delgado,
Miguel Carcaño's brother.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.680
<i>We went there</i>
<i>to search for stains of any kind</i>

41:00.760 --> 41:02.520
<i>and sources of valuable evidence.</i>

41:02.600 --> 41:06.080
<i>It was so clean</i>
<i>that nothing was visible to the eye.</i>

41:06.160 --> 41:10.800
<i>Chemicals from the cleaning products,</i>
<i>or whatever substance had been used,</i>

41:10.880 --> 41:13.400
<i>interfered even further with the procedure</i>

41:13.480 --> 41:16.120
<i>of confirmatory testing</i>
<i>and the collection of DNA.</i>

41:23.120 --> 41:24.000
<i>What?</i>

41:24.080 --> 41:26.560
<i>Hey, I just got out right now.</i>

41:26.640 --> 41:29.680
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-And now they're going to take the car.</i>

41:29.760 --> 41:30.880
<i>What car?</i>

41:30.960 --> 41:32.360
<i>Mine!</i>

41:32.440 --> 41:35.760
<i>-You're joking! Why?</i>
<i>-Well, I have no fucking idea.</i>

41:35.840 --> 41:39.640
<i>Maybe they think that we moved</i>
<i>the car with the girl inside.</i>

41:49.800 --> 41:51.600
POLICE FORCE
FORENSIC DEPARTMENT

41:54.120 --> 41:55.360
Samuel, good afternoon.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.520
<i>Good afternoon, María.</i>

41:56.600 --> 41:59.320
You are Miguel's friend, right?

41:59.400 --> 42:00.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:00.400 --> 42:03.760
And, Miguel, how…
how would you describe him?

42:04.720 --> 42:08.360
<i>Well, I consider Miguel</i>
<i>to be a nice guy, very affectionate,</i>

42:08.440 --> 42:12.720
<i>although sometimes</i>
<i>he has his rebellious outbursts.</i>

42:13.600 --> 42:17.000
<i>But he's a kid who, deep down,</i>
<i>has a very good heart.</i>

42:17.080 --> 42:19.960
By the way, is Miguel participating
in the search for Marta?

42:20.040 --> 42:21.040
<i>No.</i>

42:21.120 --> 42:24.960
As always happens, the last one to see her
is the main suspect.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.920
I don't know if the police think the same
because they don't tell me anything.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.640
Maybe it's someone else

42:30.720 --> 42:33.240
and we're thinking
that the suspect is this man.

42:33.320 --> 42:38.320
The police, however, have already
questioned this boy on several occasions.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.560
They have taken his statement
and haven't found anything strange.

42:42.640 --> 42:46.960
They have also searched his house
and have found absolutely no evidence

42:47.040 --> 42:49.240
that could link him to the disappearance

42:49.320 --> 42:50.920
of Marta del Castillo.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Apparently, according to police,

42:53.080 --> 42:55.360
this boy could have very good alibis.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.960
You begin to realize that things
are getting complicated,

43:03.040 --> 43:04.560
in terms of the media,

43:05.160 --> 43:09.480
when you have journalists
in front of your house every day.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.120

43:18.960 --> 43:22.600
are being said on television…

43:22.680 --> 43:26.640
That Miguel is the main suspect
of having done something…

43:27.240 --> 43:28.840
That's when you realize

43:28.920 --> 43:33.280
that everything
is going in a direction beyond logic.

43:43.600 --> 43:47.400
<i>Orange voicemail. Please record</i>

MIGUEL CALLS JAVIER
FEBRUARY 6 - 5:27 p.m.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.840
<i>Listen, Javi,</i>
<i>the police called me five minutes ago</i>

43:51.920 --> 43:54.920
<i>and told me to be there in half an hour.</i>

43:55.440 --> 43:59.360
<i>I'm on my way. If you call and I don't</i>
<i>pick up, it's because I'm still there.</i>

43:59.880 --> 44:01.560
<i>Okay? Goodbye.</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:25.480
<i>-What's up?</i>
<i>-What's up, Miguel? Have they let you go?</i>

44:25.560 --> 44:27.320
<i>Yes, I just got out now.</i>

44:27.400 --> 44:29.520
<i>What happened? Were they tough on you?</i>

44:29.600 --> 44:33.520
<i>You can't even imagine, man.</i>
<i>They tried to scare me, man.</i>

44:33.600 --> 44:36.960
<i>They said they were going</i>
<i>to put me in jail for three days…</i>

44:37.040 --> 44:38.960
<i>They completely drained me</i>
<i>in a way that…</i>

44:39.040 --> 44:41.840
<i>Hell, I even cried. They wore me out</i>
<i>and ran me into the ground.</i>

44:41.920 --> 44:42.760
<i>Wow.</i>

44:42.840 --> 44:47.960
<i>And everyone's saying that she's dead,</i>
<i>that I've done something to her,</i>

44:48.040 --> 44:53.080
<i>that if I admit I've done</i>
<i>something to her, they can help me.</i>

44:53.160 --> 44:55.960
<i>But, well, you'll never confess</i>
<i>to something you haven't done.</i>

44:56.040 --> 44:59.880
<i>You just have your own truth, period.</i>
<i>And that's it.</i>

44:59.960 --> 45:04.160
<i>Yeah, they said everything I say is a lie</i>
<i>and that you're covering for me.</i>

45:04.240 --> 45:06.240
<i>Sure. What else are they going to say?</i>

45:06.320 --> 45:09.160
<i>Everything they said</i>
<i>was a psychological game, you know.</i>

45:09.240 --> 45:12.680
<i>I think they've gone too far.</i>
<i>We're not cooperating any more.</i>

45:13.320 --> 45:14.720
<i>I'm getting a lawyer.</i>

45:14.800 --> 45:17.880
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>
<i>without a lawyer, do you understand?</i>

45:21.560 --> 45:26.160
We are all Marta, we are all Marta!

45:26.760 --> 45:30.000
We are all Marta!

45:31.560 --> 45:36.600
The people of Seville
felt that they had all lost a little girl.

45:36.680 --> 45:37.800
WE ARE ALL MARTA

45:37.880 --> 45:41.400
And they went out into the streets
from the very first moment

45:41.480 --> 45:45.000
to show that this little girl
had to be found no matter what.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.000
WE ARE ALL MARTA

45:46.080 --> 45:47.600
Marta, we are with you!

45:47.680 --> 45:49.240
Seville went all out.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.560
MARTA, WE LOVE YOU

45:50.640 --> 45:52.200
They went all out for us,

45:52.280 --> 45:56.880
and that really made us see
that we were not alone in this fight.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.760
The demonstrations taking place…

46:00.840 --> 46:03.440
which of course I was not ready for them.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.440
I always thought, "Oh, my God,

46:05.520 --> 46:09.240
why didn't you give me more strength
to leave that room,

46:09.320 --> 46:12.360
to get out of that bed
and be there with my husband?

46:12.960 --> 46:17.360
Give me more strength to be there, too,

46:17.440 --> 46:19.160
on the front line."

46:20.040 --> 46:22.280
We want this to end as soon as possible.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.920
Marta's friends, what do they think?
What do they say?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.960
Her friends are here.
I've seen that they've come.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.680
And 99% of them are here,
except for one of them,

46:33.760 --> 46:36.680
and we all know who that is.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.240
They're all here.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.960
If you're hammering away at him,
if he's got the TV networks all over him,

46:42.040 --> 46:45.000
how could you expect him to come and help?

46:45.080 --> 46:47.840
I mean, it was… It didn't make sense.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.600
In fact…

46:51.400 --> 46:54.520
I asked Miguel again and again,

46:55.400 --> 46:58.400
and he always told us
that he hadn't done anything,

46:58.480 --> 47:00.400
that he was a scapegoat.

47:01.320 --> 47:04.320
FEB 13, 2009 - 3 WEEKS MISSING

<i>How can I help you?</i>

47:43.080 --> 47:44.360
HEAD OF THE MINORS' DIVISION

47:44.440 --> 47:47.160
<i>The fact that he was in the hallway</i>

47:47.240 --> 47:51.160
<i>with the wheelchair in the early hours</i>
<i>of the morning was very strange to us.</i>

47:51.240 --> 47:53.800
<i>We asked his girlfriend's mother</i>

47:54.720 --> 47:56.400
<i>if she would voluntarily give us</i>

47:56.480 --> 48:00.480
<i>the clothes that Miguel Carcaño</i>
<i>was wearing that night.</i>

48:00.560 --> 48:02.000
<i>And she agreed.</i>

48:02.080 --> 48:03.400
MIGUEL CARCAÑO'S LACES

48:03.480 --> 48:06.240
<i>We went to her house</i>
<i>and the clothes were picked up.</i>

48:06.800 --> 48:08.160
<i>That was on February 4th</i>

<i>and on the 13th,</i>
<i>the forensic team</i>

48:11.040 --> 48:14.200
<i>confirmed that Marta's blood</i>
<i>had been found on the jacket</i>

48:14.280 --> 48:17.520
<i>that Miguel Carcaño</i>
<i>was wearing that night.</i>

48:18.080 --> 48:24.800
THE GENETIC PROFILE MATCHES THAT
OF MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASANUEVA

48:26.240 --> 48:30.320
FEBRUARY 14, 2009

48:32.400 --> 48:35.160
I was immediately preoccupied
with the idea that the news

48:35.240 --> 48:38.560
shouldn't be leaked to the press and
the parents shouldn't find out that way.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.280
THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ANDALUSIA

48:40.360 --> 48:42.680
And I found myself
with the terrible responsibility

48:42.760 --> 48:45.160
of meeting with Marta's father

48:45.240 --> 48:47.240
to tell him his daughter
had been murdered.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.640
Have they told you anything?

48:51.320 --> 48:54.120
Antonio, please,
can we have your attention for a second?

48:55.520 --> 48:57.640
-Antonio…
-Careful, you're going to fall.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.680
Any news?

49:09.760 --> 49:11.240
Have you spoken with Antonio?

49:11.320 --> 49:12.280
No, not yet.

49:12.360 --> 49:13.960
-Do you know…?
-Antonio, it's me.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.360
I… I was half asleep…

49:30.640 --> 49:31.920
And they came in.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.400
I heard them.

49:33.480 --> 49:36.520
My husband and his brother came in.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.960
And then I heard my mother scream.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.480
And my mother-in-law was screaming,
"Kill him, kill him!"

49:45.640 --> 49:47.800
And Antonio came in and told me,

49:47.880 --> 49:48.880
"Eva…

49:50.080 --> 49:51.200
Miguel killed her."

49:52.520 --> 49:53.680
And I said to him,

49:54.200 --> 49:55.120
"How?"

49:55.200 --> 49:57.240
He replied, "Don't worry.
She didn't suffer."

50:09.320 --> 50:13.480
<i>We all hoped</i>
<i>that Marta del Castillo would appear,</i>

50:13.560 --> 50:17.320
<i>but the news has come too soon,</i>
<i>confirming the worst of theories.</i>

50:17.400 --> 50:19.120
<i>…Marta's ex-boyfriend</i>

50:19.200 --> 50:22.480
<i>finally broke down</i>
<i>in front of the national police</i>

50:22.560 --> 50:24.320
<i>yesterday at dawn and confessed…</i>

50:24.400 --> 50:25.800
Everything seems to indicate

50:25.880 --> 50:29.040
that Marta's murderer
was her ex-boyfriend, Miguel Carcaño.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.480
Bastard! Scumbag!

50:38.560 --> 50:40.600
You son of a bitch!

50:41.840 --> 50:44.400
THE CIVIL GUARD

50:51.120 --> 50:53.560
<i>Although the secrecy</i>
<i>in the proceeding continues,</i>

50:53.640 --> 50:56.720
<i>Miguel Carcaño has participated</i>
<i>in a reconstruction of events</i>

50:56.800 --> 51:00.920
<i>as the judge has tried to establish</i>
<i>what happened on the night of January 24th</i>

51:02.240 --> 51:05.200
Son of a bitch murderer!

51:05.280 --> 51:08.400
You are here, assisted by your lawyer,

51:08.480 --> 51:11.200
and the purpose of this proceeding

51:11.280 --> 51:14.040
is to provide a reconstruction
of the version of events

51:14.120 --> 51:16.240
that you provided in your statement,

51:16.320 --> 51:18.960
which was made yesterday
in the presence of the court.

51:19.040 --> 51:23.680
Is everything approximately
where it was on the day?

51:23.760 --> 51:27.080
Yes, I was here, and we were arguing,

51:27.880 --> 51:31.520
and at one point, I grabbed the ashtray

51:31.600 --> 51:33.320
and hit her here, like this.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.480
I didn't put strength behind it.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.760
I just grabbed it and hit her like this.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.440
And she fell to the ground
and she didn't respond.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.360
And then… I got nervous.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.720
I put my head on her chest.
I couldn't hear her heart…

51:49.240 --> 51:53.200
And then I went out,
sat down there and started crying.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.560
I came back. I held her hand.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.960
I kept talking to her.
She wouldn't answer me.

51:58.040 --> 52:02.240
And I stayed here
until Samuel rang the doorbell.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.800
Right now, we don't know who has done it,
what has happened,

52:07.880 --> 52:12.560
or what will happen,
and right now, we don't know anything.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.720
It's really…

52:17.720 --> 52:18.800
disgusting.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.760
You've sat here with me
and with her mother.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.240
You knew we were desperate.
She was your friend.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.200
And you've known perfectly well
what happened since the very beginning.

52:32.720 --> 52:33.960
I won't utter

52:34.720 --> 52:36.120
the word that I would use

52:36.840 --> 52:38.760
to describe Samuel.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.760
SAMUEL'S VERSION

52:47.840 --> 52:51.120
<i>Samuel told us</i>
<i>that in the early morning of the 24th,</i>

52:51.200 --> 52:52.920
<i>Miguel had contacted him,</i>

52:53.000 --> 52:54.880
<i>he had asked him for help,</i>

52:54.960 --> 52:57.080
<i>and he had begged him to go to Seville.</i>

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
<i>He took a bus to El Prado,</i>

52:59.240 --> 53:02.160
<i>and from El Prado, he walked to León XIII.</i>

53:02.240 --> 53:03.520
<i>When he arrived,</i>

53:03.600 --> 53:06.000
<i>he saw Marta lying on the floor</i>
<i>covered in blood.</i>

53:06.080 --> 53:09.880
<i>Miguel asked for his help</i>
<i>in getting rid of the evidence.</i>

53:09.960 --> 53:12.480
<i>They took Marta out,</i>

53:12.560 --> 53:14.000
<i>put her on the motorcycle,</i>

53:14.080 --> 53:18.800
<i>and went to a certain place on a bridge,</i>

53:18.880 --> 53:20.680
<i>near the Charco de la Pava.</i>

53:29.960 --> 53:34.880
The government delegate told us
that Miguel had hit her.

53:36.440 --> 53:40.480
He and his friend Samuel
put her on a motorcycle.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.560
They put her between them,
forming a sandwich…

53:45.080 --> 53:46.320
and threw her in the river.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.120
The police took Miguel to the bridge,

53:56.200 --> 54:00.000
and he even pointed to the spot

54:00.080 --> 54:02.680
where he said
they had dumped Marta's body.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.160
The moment he told me

54:09.240 --> 54:13.960
that Miguel and Samuel
had put her on the motorcycle…

54:15.320 --> 54:20.040
Think about it.
You don't need to be a genius.

54:20.120 --> 54:25.400
But imagine a corpse
between two people on a motorcycle,

54:25.480 --> 54:27.200
crossing downtown Seville.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.800
They got to the bridge…

54:30.640 --> 54:31.800
and threw her over.

54:33.880 --> 54:35.640
Would you believe that?

55:09.240 --> 55:10.880
Nobody could believe that version.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.520
How could a guy with that kind of nerve

55:15.200 --> 55:16.600
tell you that?

55:20.080 --> 55:21.240
That wasn't the truth.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.760
No one from the national police
nor the government delegate

55:25.840 --> 55:28.480
questioned that statement.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.040
It didn't make any sense.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.160
DESPITE OUR INSISTENCE,

55:34.240 --> 55:37.160
THE NATIONAL POLICE REFUSED
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DOCUMENTARY.

55:37.240 --> 55:41.800
"WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
ABOUT MARTA'S CASE" WAS THEIR ANSWER.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.880
<i>A radical twist in the investigation</i>
<i>of Marta del Castillo's murder.</i>

55:45.960 --> 55:48.880
<i>Miguel Carcaño, who confessed</i>
<i>to murdering the Sevillian girl,</i>

55:48.960 --> 55:52.200
<i>has returned to court</i>
<i>after changing his statement last night.</i>

55:52.280 --> 55:56.520
Antonio, this very morning,
the national police went to León XIII.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.680
Yes?

55:57.760 --> 56:00.400
Apparently, they found
something in a sewer.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.480
Did you know that?

56:01.560 --> 56:05.640
No. First I hear of this.
What did they find in the sewer?

57:21.920 --> 57:26.280
