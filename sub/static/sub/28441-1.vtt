00:50.125 --> 00:53.208
For centuries,
the ancient lands of Indonesia

00:53.333 --> 00:56.708
were colonized by the Dutch Empire.

00:57.208 --> 01:01.875
Accounts of suppression,
brutality and tragedy

01:01.958 --> 01:06.042
are often lost in tales of folklore.

01:07.667 --> 01:12.625
This is one story where
the worlds of fact and fiction collide...

06:19.292 --> 06:22.792
JAVA
6 MONTHS LATER

07:36.375 --> 07:40.875
I thought I'd never return
to kiss the earth of my homeland

07:42.292 --> 07:44.833
that I had left behind.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.125
Come, let's go.

08:18.708 --> 08:19.833
Hurry!

08:53.875 --> 08:58.167
First, we must
pay our respects to your father

08:59.792 --> 09:05.000
<i>at the final resting place of all Sultans</i>
<i>and their families.</i>

09:47.833 --> 09:50.500
This is your father's grave

09:51.458 --> 09:54.542
and this... your mother's.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.917
God bless her soul.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.458
Seruni.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.500
Forgive me.

10:20.042 --> 10:22.958
I should have never left you.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.792
A long time ago,

10:35.208 --> 10:39.042
ancient kings ruled this land.

10:41.625 --> 10:46.375
Civilization here flourished
a thousand years before us.

10:48.708 --> 10:52.167
We come from a land deep with heritage.

10:53.958 --> 10:57.667
And part of it runs through your blood.

10:59.167 --> 11:02.833
Both of you are born of noble heritage.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.875
Raised in foreign lands,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.500
united by extreme circumstances.

11:11.167 --> 11:15.875
That day, your father and I
managed to escape.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.458
<i>We were lucky,</i>

11:28.250 --> 11:29.458
<i>so you survived.</i>

11:38.000 --> 11:40.208
I thought
if we could negotiate with them,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.958
they would leave us in peace.

11:42.042 --> 11:43.167
How naive!

11:43.250 --> 11:45.292
They need to pay!

11:45.375 --> 11:46.375
No.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.292
We've already lost
many of our people today.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.292
Let's not lose our future too.

11:54.958 --> 11:56.125
They're here.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.792
Just get in! Get in!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.417
Get in, Hamza.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.875
Go now.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.125
I'll delay them.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.500
No, Hamza, we move together!

13:59.583 --> 14:00.417
Arana!

14:01.500 --> 14:02.917
Get as far away as you can.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.667
Bring my boys up as your own.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.375
Save them, Arana.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.917
They are our only hope.

14:57.042 --> 15:01.750
My death shall only
strengthen the will of my people,

15:02.042 --> 15:03.417
Van Trach.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.417
Jamar.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.333
As the eldest son,
you have to shoulder the responsibility.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.667
Suwo.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.458
As the youngest,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.208
it is your brotherhood bond

15:33.542 --> 15:37.542
that will strengthen the both of you.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.375
Don't ever forget that.

16:43.833 --> 16:44.958
What do you want?

16:45.833 --> 16:47.167
Do you guys need...

16:47.250 --> 16:48.917
You came from over there.

16:51.042 --> 16:51.875
Heading towards there.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.458
So why are you stopping here?

16:55.000 --> 16:55.875
Everything OK?

16:55.958 --> 16:56.792
What are you looking at?

16:56.875 --> 16:58.042
Everything is fine.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.250
That's my wife. She's in labor.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.458
-She's in labor?
-Yes!

17:01.542 --> 17:02.667
I can help.

17:02.750 --> 17:03.625
How?

17:03.917 --> 17:04.750
What's that?

17:04.875 --> 17:05.708
I have medicine.

17:05.792 --> 17:06.792
What medicine?

17:07.167 --> 17:08.208
This is for her pain.

17:08.417 --> 17:11.083
My wife is not in pain,
she's just in labor.

17:11.167 --> 17:12.333
-But--
-Move along!

17:12.833 --> 17:13.667
Sorry, sir.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.500
We'll move along.

17:17.042 --> 17:18.083
Help.

17:36.542 --> 17:37.542
Don't move!

17:37.625 --> 17:40.042
-Or Fakar will kill her!
-Calm down. Calm down.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.625
You want to die?

17:42.875 --> 17:43.750
Get back!

17:43.833 --> 17:46.417
You think Fakar's messing around?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.667
Think again!

17:47.750 --> 17:48.583
Get back!

17:53.375 --> 17:54.208
Come here!

18:00.833 --> 18:02.292
Sri!

18:06.042 --> 18:07.417
It hurts.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.458
Next time, mind your own business.

18:17.042 --> 18:18.292
Wait, wait!

18:19.875 --> 18:21.708
Where are you heading?

18:21.792 --> 18:24.500
Please come to our village.

18:24.583 --> 18:29.042
There, you can bathe, eat, and rest.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.208
That would be my honor.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.458
Please, come!

19:16.208 --> 19:17.292
What's happening there?

19:31.333 --> 19:32.792
That man knows how to ride!

19:37.458 --> 19:39.958
I've never seen
a man ride a buffalo like that.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.792
And shoot like an Apache warrior!

20:19.542 --> 20:21.917
Earlier, I noticed crops being burned.

20:22.583 --> 20:23.708
Why?

20:25.667 --> 20:27.042
To grow opium.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.792
It's more profitable for them.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.792
If we don't burn the rice,

20:35.542 --> 20:36.875
the Dutch will burn us.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.500
There are the farmers
who chose to plant crops

20:49.083 --> 20:50.833
because they thought

20:51.417 --> 20:55.000
feeding their families was more important.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.333
But they had to pay the price.

21:13.542 --> 21:14.750
What's that smell?

21:18.458 --> 21:20.708
This is the stench

21:20.792 --> 21:22.292
of hatred!

22:14.167 --> 22:15.375
Come here, sweetheart!

22:16.792 --> 22:17.708
Grandpa!

22:20.458 --> 22:22.042
What happened to your head?

22:22.250 --> 22:24.250
I had a fall. It's just a scratch.

22:25.917 --> 22:26.917
Gentlemen.

22:27.125 --> 22:28.458
My grand daughter, Kiona.

22:29.667 --> 22:30.792
You are an excellent rider.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.292
For a...

22:33.208 --> 22:34.458
girl.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.708
Your riding was spectacular.

22:40.792 --> 22:41.750
I'm Suwo.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.250
Suwo.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.458
The hand that you kissed

22:48.583 --> 22:50.875
-is the hand that wipes her--
-Ass.

22:53.583 --> 22:59.583
Your beauty made them
forget their manners.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.958
I am Arana.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.042
How's my riding, Grandpa?

23:12.125 --> 23:12.958
Kiona!

23:13.833 --> 23:15.458
You stole my buffalo again!

23:15.750 --> 23:17.500
I only borrowed him, Father.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.708
Your father is the head of the village,

23:18.792 --> 23:21.333
while you ride buffaloes
as if you're a boy!

23:21.500 --> 23:22.708
You embarrass me!

23:23.375 --> 23:24.625
Excuse me.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.500
You should be proud of her.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.417
-Who are you people?
-Kiona!

23:32.292 --> 23:33.125
Sri!

23:35.708 --> 23:37.375
-Father, don't.
-Silence!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.917
-What do you want here?
-Sakar.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.250
These men are our friends,
not our enemies.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.458
-They are--
-They are strangers!

23:44.542 --> 23:46.583
And all strangers are enemies.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.667
If the Dutch finds out,

23:48.750 --> 23:50.458
-we'll be the ones who pay the price.
-Have you no shame?

23:50.542 --> 23:54.958
These men saved me and your daughter Sri!

23:55.042 --> 23:56.875
That's two lives you owe them!

23:57.833 --> 23:59.000
It's true, Father.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.875
If not for them, both of us would be dead.

24:03.708 --> 24:04.542
Forgive me.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.000
I misjudged you.

24:08.250 --> 24:11.333
Come join us for dinner tonight.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.375
Would you like to freshen up?

24:54.750 --> 24:57.500
Boys, stop showing off!

24:57.583 --> 24:59.583
The ladies are getting over-excited.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.167
Handsome!

25:04.250 --> 25:06.167
We've met before!

25:06.250 --> 25:08.833
-Where?
-In my dreams.

25:09.917 --> 25:12.625
I wouldn't forget
a dashing man like that.

25:12.708 --> 25:15.625
Maybe you'll remember
once he takes off his sarong.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.667
Let me help you, handsome.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.458
It won't take long.

25:27.708 --> 25:32.292
These men saved my family.

25:32.625 --> 25:37.375
Henceforth, we will treat them
as our family.

25:37.667 --> 25:38.667
Yes!

25:40.083 --> 25:40.917
Sir, with all due respect,

25:41.000 --> 25:46.333
your father and daughter
should not be traveling alone.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.292
I would have sent men to accompany them,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.792
but all our men are assisting
to re-plant the crops.

25:53.875 --> 25:54.833
What?

25:55.583 --> 25:56.583
Assisting?

25:57.750 --> 25:58.875
It's forced labor.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.417
Forced labor?

26:00.500 --> 26:03.833
You've seen what happens
if we dare to oppose them.

26:05.542 --> 26:08.042
Why doesn't the Sultan do something?

26:08.125 --> 26:09.958
We haven't had a Sultan for a while.

26:10.708 --> 26:12.167
It suits the Dutch just fine.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.167
The Dutch control everything now.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.167
Father!

26:15.250 --> 26:16.083
Kiona!

26:16.708 --> 26:18.083
You say too much.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.333
Don't you dare silence me, Sakar!

26:21.708 --> 26:24.792
Our villagers will starve
if we don't have rice.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.458
This is hell on earth.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.625
Ever since Van Trach returned!

26:32.750 --> 26:33.625
Van Trach?

26:33.750 --> 26:35.333
He and his men kill, rape

26:35.500 --> 26:37.750
and pillage, without fear of punishment.

26:37.875 --> 26:38.708
Kiona!

26:40.042 --> 26:41.083
And none of us dare to fight them.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.000
Kiona!

26:43.708 --> 26:45.625
Don't pay attention
to my daughter's words.

26:46.250 --> 26:48.333
There's a lot
she still doesn't understand.

26:48.833 --> 26:51.375
As long as we live by their rules,

26:52.167 --> 26:54.750
we'll live in peace
and they'll leave us alone.

26:55.333 --> 26:59.583
As long as we live by their rules,

27:00.208 --> 27:01.917
we will live in peace.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.250
I believed that once.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.542
But the consequence was...

27:12.333 --> 27:14.375
a life was lost!

27:32.542 --> 27:33.583
Damn it!

27:40.542 --> 27:41.750
I don't need help.

27:42.917 --> 27:43.958
I can manage.

27:46.292 --> 27:47.458
What are you doing here?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.542
Shouldn't you be inside
with the other men,

27:52.333 --> 27:54.208
making important decisions?

27:54.542 --> 27:55.875
I don't usually get to participate,

27:56.208 --> 27:58.000
in making important decisions.

27:59.667 --> 28:00.542
Oh, yeah?

28:01.542 --> 28:03.625
It's tough, not being taken seriously.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.542
What would you know about that?

28:06.958 --> 28:09.208
I mean, I know how you feel.

28:09.792 --> 28:11.000
I can relate.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.333
Can you really?

28:12.417 --> 28:15.292
As the youngest,
I am also at a disadvantage.

28:16.333 --> 28:19.250
No. You have one huge advantage.

28:19.917 --> 28:21.042
You're a man.

28:21.667 --> 28:22.958
You can do whatever you want,

28:23.042 --> 28:25.167
whenever you want, however you want,

28:25.708 --> 28:26.958
and with whomever you want.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.042
You're not seen as an embarrassment,

28:29.125 --> 28:29.958
nor evaluated,

28:30.625 --> 28:31.750
and not judged.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.583
And all that is because...

28:34.875 --> 28:35.875
you're a man.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.833
You don't think
there's pressure being a man?

28:40.208 --> 28:41.917
I was born with a set of rules.

28:43.292 --> 28:44.542
Don't show your feelings.

28:44.792 --> 28:47.208
Be braver, be stronger.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.000
Fight. Be a hero. Win.

28:51.500 --> 28:56.250
As if those are the only virtues
that make you a man.

28:58.958 --> 29:00.792
The key is timing.

29:05.167 --> 29:06.417
You're rushing

29:06.833 --> 29:09.292
and therefore, your aim is off.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.458
Are you saying you have better aim?

29:13.542 --> 29:14.375
Of course.

29:14.667 --> 29:15.833
I'm a man.

29:15.917 --> 29:16.750
Arrogant.

29:20.708 --> 29:21.958
Like this.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.708
I only want to help.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.333
<i>I'm so happy to see you.</i>

29:44.417 --> 29:45.875
You've been gone for so long.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.875
Distance has forced me to grow up.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.292
Father, Kiona.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.125
I'm tired of hiding.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.333
Moving from village to village
is really tough.

29:56.833 --> 29:58.042
I only want to come home!

30:01.375 --> 30:04.167
We just don't want you to experience

30:04.708 --> 30:06.333
what we had gone through here.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.917
Though I'm glad you are here,

30:09.500 --> 30:10.625
I also fear for your safety.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
They are coming! They are coming!

30:22.958 --> 30:24.708
They are coming! They are coming!

30:26.875 --> 30:27.750
You must leave now!

30:27.833 --> 30:28.833
Kiona!

30:30.000 --> 30:30.917
Kiona!

30:31.083 --> 30:32.750
Quick! Guide them to the forest!

30:32.833 --> 30:33.708
There's no time!

30:33.792 --> 30:34.833
I'm going with Sri!

30:34.917 --> 30:35.958
It's worse if they find her with them!

30:36.042 --> 30:37.167
-But.
-Go!

30:38.667 --> 30:40.000
-Suwo!
-Ready!

31:07.125 --> 31:08.708
That's enough.

31:08.792 --> 31:10.000
Cover it with leaves!

31:10.167 --> 31:11.000
Yes, Uncle.

31:22.083 --> 31:22.958
Hurry up!

31:27.875 --> 31:28.708
Sir.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.500
These are the people,
along with three others,

31:32.625 --> 31:34.083
who attacked Fakar.

31:34.417 --> 31:36.333
Sir, this is not true!

31:36.417 --> 31:39.083
-Not true?
-He attacked us!

31:39.167 --> 31:40.375
Silence!

31:41.333 --> 31:44.542
-Where are the others?
-Sir, he tried to rape me.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.125
Who will you believe, sir?

31:46.750 --> 31:48.542
Fakar, your loyal servant

31:48.625 --> 31:51.875
who lost an eye for the company,

31:52.833 --> 31:53.667
or...

31:54.167 --> 31:56.333
this cursed whore?

31:56.417 --> 31:57.375
Let go!

31:57.458 --> 31:58.917
Don't! Don't!

31:59.708 --> 32:00.542
Sri!

32:03.292 --> 32:05.125
She's not even registered!

32:07.042 --> 32:07.875
No stamp.

32:12.875 --> 32:13.750
It's true, sir.

32:14.167 --> 32:15.750
There were three other people here,

32:15.833 --> 32:17.083
but they're gone now!

32:17.458 --> 32:18.333
Fakar was right!

32:18.417 --> 32:19.750
Fakar was right!

32:26.833 --> 32:27.667
Please, sir,

32:27.875 --> 32:29.625
don't harm her.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.500
She has nothing to do with this!

32:31.917 --> 32:33.417
What are you waiting for?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.583
Register her!

32:34.667 --> 32:35.542
Help, sir!

32:35.625 --> 32:36.458
Don't, sir!

32:38.875 --> 32:40.417
What's happening?

32:40.875 --> 32:41.708
Registration.

32:44.833 --> 32:46.042
For what?

32:49.083 --> 32:50.458
Their stamp on us.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.792
We didn't register Sri.

32:54.417 --> 32:56.042
She was too young.

33:13.583 --> 33:14.583
Sri!

33:33.708 --> 33:34.583
Who's that man?

33:35.375 --> 33:36.667
His name is Drost.

33:37.292 --> 33:38.667
Van Trach's right-hand man.

34:19.458 --> 34:22.083
Take the old man and the girl!

34:38.500 --> 34:39.458
Just leave me.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.333
Come.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.417
Leave her be.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.333
Take the bags.

35:01.292 --> 35:03.208
Forgive me, Sri.

35:13.792 --> 35:16.833
Tomorrow we'll explore the town.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.167
I am sure, Uncle.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.542
Van Trach will be there.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.292
The time for reckoning is here.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.333
This is it, boys.

37:03.792 --> 37:07.292
That's all the rice you get
for that little opium!

37:17.667 --> 37:19.417
Go get some supplies.

37:19.917 --> 37:21.417
I will scout around.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.000
Where are you from?

37:24.250 --> 37:25.083
Come in!

37:25.333 --> 37:26.875
Many special goods inside.

37:28.542 --> 37:29.417
Come in!

37:31.125 --> 37:33.000
Welcome, gentlemen.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.375
Sir!

37:41.250 --> 37:44.000
I have something very special for you.

37:44.083 --> 37:45.500
You are sure to like this!

37:52.833 --> 37:53.708
Try this.

37:53.792 --> 37:55.833
Scorpion arak.

37:55.917 --> 37:58.208
Makes you strong.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.667
Makes the ladies feel good!

38:01.667 --> 38:03.500
If there's one thing I don't like,

38:03.583 --> 38:04.667
it's that.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.000
Scorpions.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.750
Relax, sir. Relax!

38:12.583 --> 38:13.583
Sir!

38:14.375 --> 38:16.792
This just came in.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.917
It is a bit pricey.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.042
But...

38:20.125 --> 38:23.625
You can use this over and over again.

38:24.417 --> 38:26.000
You pay more,

38:26.625 --> 38:29.167
but you can last longer!

38:34.458 --> 38:35.458
Count this!

38:51.083 --> 38:53.375
Sir, come buy some chickens.

38:56.917 --> 38:57.917
How much?

39:04.250 --> 39:06.167
These buds open only at night.

39:06.625 --> 39:07.500
Kiona.

39:09.667 --> 39:10.750
What are you doing here?

39:10.917 --> 39:13.625
Besides breeding bulls,
Father also grows flowers.

39:16.125 --> 39:18.333
Any news about
your grandfather and sister?

39:20.958 --> 39:22.083
No news yet,

39:22.542 --> 39:25.958
just that all the headmen
have been summoned to town.

39:28.292 --> 39:31.792
Will Van Trach be there?

39:31.875 --> 39:32.917
He should be,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
he summoned my father specifically.

39:36.917 --> 39:37.917
Come with me.

39:38.458 --> 39:39.667
I was about to go to the town square.

40:21.042 --> 40:21.875
Grandpa!

40:22.708 --> 40:23.542
Sri.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.000
Van Trach.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.125
No!

43:40.667 --> 43:41.583
Sir.

43:42.667 --> 43:44.875
I have served you well.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.083
Please, sir.

43:49.708 --> 43:51.750
I did everything you asked.

43:51.833 --> 43:54.417
I cannot make this impossible choice.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.167
They are my family, sir.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.083
They have done nothing wrong!

43:58.167 --> 43:59.750
Quiet, Sakar!

43:59.833 --> 44:03.042
Why are you bargaining with the devil?

44:04.292 --> 44:08.500
I am ready to die, Sakar.

44:08.583 --> 44:12.833
But why do you have to beg to this dog?

44:13.708 --> 44:14.792
Why?

44:19.583 --> 44:20.458
Hey, devil!

44:21.708 --> 44:23.708
Just kill me!

44:25.000 --> 44:28.750
You will rot in hell soon enough!

44:34.125 --> 44:34.958
Don't.

46:23.958 --> 46:25.167
Father!

46:25.708 --> 46:27.250
Not here! Too many people!

46:27.333 --> 46:28.583
Father!

46:29.417 --> 46:30.458
Father!

46:34.167 --> 46:35.625
Cowards!

46:35.708 --> 46:37.958
All of you are cowards!

47:16.625 --> 47:18.625
I am thankful.

47:25.958 --> 47:27.792
I am grateful, sir.

47:52.083 --> 47:54.000
We have to follow him.

49:05.917 --> 49:07.667
It's risky, hiding out here.

49:07.750 --> 49:09.667
It's still the closest we can get to him.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.375
Have you found us a way out?

49:15.708 --> 49:16.583
Don't worry.

49:16.708 --> 49:19.042
The cute girls downstairs told me this.

49:19.458 --> 49:22.000
There is an exit, at the back.

49:24.042 --> 49:25.375
Now we wait.

49:38.625 --> 49:39.792
Sit down, Suwo.

49:41.208 --> 49:44.042
I want to speak to the two of you.

49:49.750 --> 49:52.042
I have waited for this day.

49:52.917 --> 49:55.375
This dagger belonged to your father.

49:59.417 --> 50:02.292
This dagger has been
handed down for generations,

50:02.375 --> 50:04.375
to each successive Sultan.

50:06.167 --> 50:08.750
And now, you are its rightful owner.

50:10.375 --> 50:13.708
The Javanese carry them for protection.

50:14.417 --> 50:18.125
Bring it with you everywhere you go.

50:18.333 --> 50:19.708
Always keep it with you.

50:23.167 --> 50:24.000
Suwo.

50:25.583 --> 50:28.833
All these years, I've kept this knife.

50:30.333 --> 50:31.792
It serves as a reminder to me,

50:33.417 --> 50:36.333
of the sacrifice and the pain
I've endured.

50:38.708 --> 50:40.000
This is now yours.

50:41.958 --> 50:44.208
We all have the same purpose.

50:45.167 --> 50:46.500
We must work together,

50:47.417 --> 50:48.917
to reach our goal.

50:49.542 --> 50:50.750
Remember that well.

51:09.292 --> 51:10.917
I have him.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.542
Relax.

51:22.250 --> 51:23.458
Inhale.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.667
Slow.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.250
Then be sure.

51:35.458 --> 51:36.500
Ready.

51:38.542 --> 51:39.458
Be sure.

51:40.958 --> 51:44.000
There's...
There's a servant in the way.

51:44.625 --> 51:46.000
I can't get a clear shot, Uncle.

51:46.083 --> 51:47.292
I'll do it.

52:05.250 --> 52:06.792
Die, you son of a bitch.

52:18.125 --> 52:19.125
Uncle.

52:27.125 --> 52:28.083
Uncle.

52:30.292 --> 52:31.125
Uncle.

52:34.833 --> 52:35.750
Uncle.

52:41.333 --> 52:42.750
Don't!

52:43.375 --> 52:44.667
Uncle.

52:44.750 --> 52:47.125
-Uncle.
-Uncle. Hey.

52:47.208 --> 52:48.333
What's wrong?

52:48.458 --> 52:49.917
Suwo, go to the Chinese store.
Get medicine.

52:50.917 --> 52:51.917
Uncle.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.083
-OK. OK.
-I'll look for another way.

53:20.958 --> 53:22.375
I'm so sorry.

53:23.667 --> 53:27.375
Your father and grandfather
were brave men.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.250
You see that old lady over there?

53:34.125 --> 53:36.333
Van Trach's gang killed her son.

53:37.375 --> 53:40.542
Or rather, hunted him down for pleasure.

53:41.125 --> 53:43.750
They returned his bullet-ridden body

53:44.750 --> 53:46.167
but without his head.

53:46.958 --> 53:49.292
The bar owner likes keeping it
as a trophy.

53:49.875 --> 53:52.375
She can't rest
until her son is whole again.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.333
But no one can help her.

53:57.458 --> 54:01.292
This is our life living
under Van Trach's rule.

54:02.667 --> 54:06.042
You're the pretty girl Fakar talked about!

54:09.708 --> 54:10.625
I want to introduce you...

54:11.292 --> 54:13.917
to some of our hungry boys.

54:18.417 --> 54:19.500
Come.

55:09.333 --> 55:10.208
You!

55:10.292 --> 55:14.542
Long time no see.

55:31.167 --> 55:33.208
Cyclops. What are you doing?

55:33.292 --> 55:35.333
Looking for lice. Why?

55:35.417 --> 55:39.000
If you plan on blowing
his brains out all over my bar,

55:39.083 --> 55:40.667
you better think twice.

55:43.125 --> 55:43.958
Fine.

55:47.333 --> 55:49.417
Fakar is watching you.

56:05.375 --> 56:07.833
I've been watching you.

56:07.917 --> 56:09.500
What do you want here?

56:22.750 --> 56:25.000
You have balls of steel.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
Coming into my bar like that.

56:27.583 --> 56:28.458
Fine.

56:29.583 --> 56:31.292
I'll leave.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.208
But first...

56:36.708 --> 56:40.292
how about that trophy,

56:42.583 --> 56:44.250
and the girl over there...

56:45.958 --> 56:50.167
in exchange for your lives.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.708
You're funny.

57:02.083 --> 57:04.542
But it seems, the collection on my wall

57:04.625 --> 57:06.083
will be much better...

57:08.542 --> 57:10.500
with another skull.

59:36.417 --> 59:38.125
What's happening here?

59:57.792 --> 59:59.458
You must be ready.

59:59.542 --> 1:00:01.917
He might come to you tonight.

1:00:04.583 --> 1:00:06.000
Why are you still here?

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:09.708
We can find a way to escape.

1:00:10.750 --> 1:00:12.833
Many have tried.

1:00:13.792 --> 1:00:15.917
They are always captured,

1:00:16.500 --> 1:00:19.583
and hung on the Banyan tree outside.

1:00:21.958 --> 1:00:23.708
How can you stand this?

1:00:26.167 --> 1:00:27.417
My husband,

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.375
and my entire family have vanished.

1:00:35.292 --> 1:00:38.333
I have no one else but myself.

1:00:41.083 --> 1:00:42.375
No one else.

1:02:15.042 --> 1:02:17.083
I'm not your mother.

1:02:17.708 --> 1:02:19.542
I do not want to be linked to your past.

1:03:39.542 --> 1:03:41.542
Where are you going?

1:03:42.042 --> 1:03:43.500
To clear my head,

1:03:43.792 --> 1:03:45.583
get some air.

1:03:45.667 --> 1:03:47.083
Wait, Uncle. Look.

1:03:56.125 --> 1:03:57.208
Go find Suwo.

1:04:01.333 --> 1:04:02.458
Aren't you coming, Uncle?

1:04:03.792 --> 1:04:04.750
No.

1:04:05.208 --> 1:04:06.792
Meet me at the village later.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.917
Van Trach?

1:04:09.375 --> 1:04:10.458
Find your brother first.

1:04:10.750 --> 1:04:11.583
Go.

1:06:18.542 --> 1:06:20.750
You won't get anything out of me.

1:06:23.625 --> 1:06:24.750
Fakar will get the brand ready!

1:06:25.958 --> 1:06:28.375
Use the knife.

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.375
It's not Fakar's.

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:41.833
It was on the table.

1:06:42.417 --> 1:06:44.125
It belongs to him.

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:49.583
Answer!

1:06:50.375 --> 1:06:51.333
Think hard.

1:06:53.083 --> 1:06:55.167
Where did you last leave it?

1:07:04.542 --> 1:07:05.500
I am his son.

1:07:14.958 --> 1:07:15.875
Sir...

1:07:17.083 --> 1:07:18.708
there's an intruder in your house.

1:07:26.042 --> 1:07:27.292
Thank you, sir!

1:07:41.250 --> 1:07:44.167
You're not in a hurry, are you?

1:07:45.750 --> 1:07:46.792
Leave him! He's had enough!

1:07:47.417 --> 1:07:48.583
Stop torturing him!

1:07:48.667 --> 1:07:50.417
I see, you want one too.

1:07:54.125 --> 1:07:58.083
Where do you want Fakar to put yours?

1:07:58.458 --> 1:08:01.000
How about here?

1:08:01.958 --> 1:08:07.000
Or should Fakar go for your forehead?

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.042
Yes.

1:08:09.708 --> 1:08:11.125
The forehead will do.

1:08:19.208 --> 1:08:20.500
Are you all right?

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:24.792
Thank you.

1:08:45.792 --> 1:08:48.417
I thought
Van Trach had surely killed you.

1:08:49.708 --> 1:08:51.875
He might as well have.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.042
How did you find the strength?

1:09:12.208 --> 1:09:14.375
With every beat of my heart,

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.375
you were there with me too, Arana.

1:09:20.333 --> 1:09:21.875
You were my hope.

1:09:24.667 --> 1:09:28.167
There has not been a single day
when I don't regret.

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:32.000
And ask God for forgiveness

1:09:34.333 --> 1:09:36.167
for leaving you.

1:09:41.833 --> 1:09:43.292
My love.

1:09:46.667 --> 1:09:47.792
Seruni...

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:14.000
Van Trach!

1:10:55.125 --> 1:10:56.667
Come! Hurry!

1:10:57.458 --> 1:10:58.292
Hide!

1:10:59.792 --> 1:11:00.750
Thank you.

1:11:00.917 --> 1:11:02.083
You're welcome.

1:11:03.750 --> 1:11:04.583
Uncle!

1:11:05.708 --> 1:11:06.625
Suwo!

1:11:22.208 --> 1:11:23.417
You must be Jamar.

1:11:24.417 --> 1:11:26.417
You have your father's eyes.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.125
You're that woman

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:29.833
at Van Trach's house.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.375
It's OK, Jamar.

1:11:31.708 --> 1:11:32.625
She's his wife?

1:11:34.458 --> 1:11:35.375
I am Seruni.

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:37.792
Your uncle's wife.

1:11:41.875 --> 1:11:43.167
-But we thought you were...
-Yes.

1:11:44.292 --> 1:11:46.458
We all did.

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:48.500
Seruni is alive.

1:11:55.708 --> 1:11:57.667
You look just like your mother.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:00.917
Aunty?

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.167
Yes, I'm your aunty.

1:12:03.250 --> 1:12:04.083
Suwo,

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:07.958
I'll wait outside.

1:12:08.583 --> 1:12:09.458
Be careful.

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:13.667
Uncle...

1:12:14.667 --> 1:12:16.292
Van Trach probably knows we're here.

1:12:16.542 --> 1:12:17.750
We should go.

1:12:17.833 --> 1:12:18.667
Yes.

1:12:18.750 --> 1:12:20.000
We still have a chance to kill him.

1:12:20.083 --> 1:12:21.667
To avenge our parents.

1:12:21.750 --> 1:12:23.125
Your father was a warrior,

1:12:23.583 --> 1:12:25.375
but he fought for justice.

1:12:25.958 --> 1:12:29.500
He would never let his sons
waste their lives

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:30.750
for the sake of vengeance.

1:12:31.292 --> 1:12:32.333
Have you forgotten?

1:12:32.625 --> 1:12:35.792
That day,
father set out to negotiate peace

1:12:36.375 --> 1:12:39.250
but instead he was murdered.

1:12:39.667 --> 1:12:40.625
Jamar, don't.

1:12:40.708 --> 1:12:42.292
I won't be so foolish
to make the same mistake.

1:12:42.833 --> 1:12:44.917
Revenge is a right.

1:12:45.167 --> 1:12:46.875
He robbed us of our family.

1:12:46.958 --> 1:12:49.208
Revenge may be a right,

1:12:50.875 --> 1:12:55.292
but forgiveness makes you stronger.

1:12:55.833 --> 1:12:56.708
Jamar,

1:12:57.625 --> 1:12:59.000
I'm wrong.

1:13:00.125 --> 1:13:03.000
Your father never acted out of hatred.

1:13:03.875 --> 1:13:07.125
He always chose to forgive, if he could.

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:10.667
If not for revenge, then why are we here?

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:14.167
To serve justice.

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:17.417
For our people.

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:27.708
Van Trach!

1:13:30.167 --> 1:13:31.000
Kiona!

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.333
We're surrounded.

1:14:16.250 --> 1:14:17.292
To die with you,

1:14:19.042 --> 1:14:21.250
would be my greatest honor, Arana.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.167
Let me go!

1:14:40.958 --> 1:14:41.917
Seruni?

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:57.333
Animals! Get back!

1:15:01.792 --> 1:15:02.625
Stay down!

1:15:09.708 --> 1:15:10.542
Suwo!

1:15:11.042 --> 1:15:11.917
Everyone all right?

1:15:14.625 --> 1:15:15.458
Uncle.

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:17.167
Arana.

1:15:36.292 --> 1:15:37.125
Jamar,

1:15:37.458 --> 1:15:38.917
we can use the smoke to escape.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.250
-What?
-Clear the way first.

1:15:40.375 --> 1:15:41.250
Are you mad?

1:15:41.333 --> 1:15:42.667
You clear the way,

1:15:42.750 --> 1:15:44.042
I'll help uncle.

1:15:45.125 --> 1:15:46.792
No way. We have to stay as a group.

1:15:46.875 --> 1:15:49.208
Please trust me.
I will bring them out in one piece.

1:16:11.167 --> 1:16:13.292
Uncle, we need to cover your wound.

1:16:13.375 --> 1:16:15.417
-Bear with it, Uncle.
-It's just a scratch, Suwo.

1:16:15.667 --> 1:16:17.042
Just bear with the pain for a while.

1:16:17.625 --> 1:16:18.583
Suwo,

1:16:18.667 --> 1:16:22.208
our time together is at an end.

1:16:23.250 --> 1:16:25.375
-No.
-It is time

1:16:25.792 --> 1:16:27.542
for you to take hold of your own destiny.

1:16:28.708 --> 1:16:29.958
I'm not leaving you two behind.

1:16:31.083 --> 1:16:32.167
Indeed you aren't

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:35.500
because I'm the one who has to leave.

1:16:40.792 --> 1:16:42.667
I have always loved you

1:16:43.125 --> 1:16:44.333
and Jamar

1:16:45.250 --> 1:16:47.333
as my own sons.

1:16:48.167 --> 1:16:49.958
<i>Your father</i>
<i>will be so proud of both of you.</i>

1:16:50.875 --> 1:16:53.042
<i>I'm sure that's what he'll say</i>

1:16:53.208 --> 1:16:56.208
<i>when the wind carries me to meet him.</i>

1:16:58.458 --> 1:16:59.542
<i>Don't worry, Suwo.</i>

1:17:00.792 --> 1:17:03.042
I'm very much at peace.

1:17:07.875 --> 1:17:09.750
It is time for you to leave now.

1:17:10.375 --> 1:17:12.125
Jamar is waiting for you.

1:17:15.542 --> 1:17:16.542
Go.

1:24:57.458 --> 1:24:59.708
Come on. Go.

1:24:59.958 --> 1:25:00.792
Go.

1:26:32.875 --> 1:26:34.458
Sir, our guests have arrived.

1:28:39.833 --> 1:28:42.667
Van Trach, let's make a deal.

1:28:43.833 --> 1:28:46.375
Take your men, leave this place

1:28:46.458 --> 1:28:48.000
and don't ever return.

1:28:55.875 --> 1:28:59.583
In that case,
be prepared to face judgement.

1:29:18.333 --> 1:29:20.167
So what's it going to be?

1:29:20.625 --> 1:29:21.833
War.

1:29:21.917 --> 1:29:22.917
Or peace?

1:34:46.792 --> 1:34:49.333
I'll give you one bullet.

1:34:55.708 --> 1:34:57.458
What are you going to do, boy?

1:36:31.750 --> 1:36:32.625
Are you all set?

1:36:33.167 --> 1:36:34.125
All set.

1:36:39.208 --> 1:36:40.042
Uncle was right.

1:36:40.875 --> 1:36:42.375
This dagger saved my life.

1:36:43.083 --> 1:36:45.458
Look, this is where
the bullet bounced off it.

1:36:53.708 --> 1:36:54.917
I'll get the horses ready.

1:37:03.833 --> 1:37:05.667
I know that you must leave.

1:37:06.917 --> 1:37:08.167
So must we.

1:37:09.333 --> 1:37:10.958
They will be back for more blood.

1:37:16.792 --> 1:37:18.292
We'll meet again

1:37:19.417 --> 1:37:20.583
when the time is right.

1:37:31.208 --> 1:37:32.417
Tell the rest of our people

1:37:33.583 --> 1:37:34.583
that there's still hope.

1:37:36.042 --> 1:37:38.167
And there are still people
who are willing to fight

1:37:38.583 --> 1:37:40.000
for justice.

1:38:04.292 --> 1:38:05.917
This belongs to my uncle,

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:06.958
Arana.

1:38:08.125 --> 1:38:09.083
And now it's yours.

1:38:09.792 --> 1:38:11.042
Take care of it, yeah?

1:38:11.833 --> 1:38:13.208
OK.

1:38:14.750 --> 1:38:15.667
Thank you.

1:38:16.333 --> 1:38:18.000
We'll never forget you.

1:38:31.625 --> 1:38:33.917
We'll meet them again.

1:38:36.083 --> 1:38:37.458
How are you so sure?

1:38:40.833 --> 1:38:42.458
Because when legends are born,

1:38:43.792 --> 1:38:45.375
they will never die.
