with Severide?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.704
- Whoa, hold on, Patterson.
You'll wreck my squad.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.206
- Who's squad?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.607
It's up to Severide to find
his place in the mix.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.342
Or not.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.076
- The only reason why Riddle was
up in everybody's business

00:12.079 --> 00:13.729
is because he thinks
he's got a shot

00:13.730 --> 00:15.380
at making Fire Commissioner.
Everybody knows that.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.715
- Careful.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.384
- Something's wrong.

- Hey.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.434
- In my mind,

00:35.436 --> 00:39.471
we were gonna be this family.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.374
We would find a house together,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.410
fix it up together,

00:44.412 --> 00:47.746
grow old in it together,
and we would...

00:57.491 --> 01:02.461
But that's not the way
that it worked out.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.531
And I know better than anyone
that life doesn't--

01:05.533 --> 01:10.636
life doesn't line up into
these perfect straight lines.

01:11.672 --> 01:16.275
But it would be nice...

01:16.277 --> 01:18.143
it would be nice
if every now and then

01:18.145 --> 01:20.779
I didn't get the curveball,

Believe it, Gabby.
You are strong.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.570
- I know.

And I know that
I do have a family.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.674
The one that I grew up with,

02:05.226 --> 02:06.325
- Yes.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.127
The doctors have cleared her.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.229
Glad to have her back.
She's a top-notch firefighter.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.830
- Well, you can understand
my concern.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.432
She jumps to arson,

02:13.434 --> 02:15.334
presumably because she got
herself pregnant,

02:15.336 --> 02:17.369
then she loses the baby,
and then she jumps

02:17.371 --> 02:19.605
right back onto truck,
serving under the officer

02:19.607 --> 02:22.508
who may or may not have
fathered the child,

02:22.510 --> 02:23.742

02:23.744 --> 02:26.912
- I beg your pardon?

02:26.914 --> 02:29.748
- Relax.
I don't listen to gossip.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.383
All I care about is
whether or not

02:31.385 --> 02:34.520
this woman's ready
to go back to work.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.489
- Well, she is.
Trust me on that.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.625
Gabriela Dawson has been a part
of this 51 family

for as long as--
- Now, I'm gonna stop you

02:40.895 --> 02:42.427
right there, Boden.
You see,

02:42.429 --> 02:45.797
this isn't a family.
This is a workplace.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.766
And that's your problem
right there, Boden.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.202
You're too soft on your people,
and this is why

02:50.204 --> 02:52.437
we've got so many headaches
involving 51.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.672
- Headaches?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.940
- The entire
Kelly Severide issue?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.275
- Oh, come on.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.977
- The questions about your
response time?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.678
- We were vindicated on that.
- You mouthing off to the press?

02:59.680 --> 03:03.382
- Oh, there it is.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.918
Pardon me, Chief.
I have to ask.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.786
Your sudden interest in 51
wouldn't have anything to do

03:07.788 --> 03:11.390
with your rumored political
aspirations, would it?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.659
<i> [tense music]</i>

03:23.304 --> 03:24.770
- Yeah, let's.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.872
- Was I pleased when a little
birdie from the Mayor's Office

03:26.874 --> 03:29.641
confirmed I was on the short
list for Fire Commissioner?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.476
You bet I was.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.245
And what they're looking for,
Wallace, is someone

03:33.247 --> 03:35.881
who's going to keep the machine
humming quietly along,

03:35.883 --> 03:39.318
but I have one squeaky wheel
in my district: your house.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.554
So, yes, I have taken

Take note, candidate.

Bobby Dunbar?
He was the real deal.

- I know, it's insulting.

the union involved,

05:09.043 --> 05:10.642
I'll back you 100%.

- Okay, so, the bride and groom,
Becca and David?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.594
Well, I talked to her
at the hospital,

09:55.595 --> 09:58.029
and her parents are flying back
to Atlanta tomorrow at noon.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.731
- Becca's father works two jobs,
and he can't afford

09:59.733 --> 10:01.333
to lose either of them.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.934
The family poured all their
money into that wedding.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.270
- They're holding David
overnight at Chicago Med,

10:05.272 --> 10:08.373
for observation--discharge
is 7:00 a.m.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.142
So, we were thinking...

10:11.144 --> 10:12.777
we could host the wedding here.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.245
First thing in the morning.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.114
- Here?
- At the firehouse.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.383
Just, like, a simple thing,
we could get flowers donated,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.185
put folding chairs
on the apparatus floor...

10:20.187 --> 10:24.623
- Should I invite Chief Riddle?

10:24.625 --> 10:26.858
Just in case you have
failed to notice,

10:26.860 --> 10:29.027
Riddle has made 51
his pet project.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.695
Right now, we need
to keep our heads down,

10:30.697 --> 10:31.863
our nose to the grindstone.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.765
- Chief, we get it,
but this family,

10:33.767 --> 10:35.066
they just lost everything.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.269
- I feel for this family.
I really do.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.172
Our job is to protect them.
We did that.

10:43.276 --> 10:48.246
Speaking of Riddle, you need
to get over to headquarters.

10:48.248 --> 10:52.083
Make your case.
Now.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.257
- I thought you of all people
would appreciate

10:59.259 --> 11:01.292
a firehouse wedding.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.295
<i> [stirring music]</i>

11:04.297 --> 11:11.903

11:11.905 --> 11:14.806
- Wedding would've lifted
spirits around here, I bet.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.976
- I know--the vows, the music,
a little cake...

11:17.978 --> 11:21.046
- Yeah, and two smitten kids
with a wide open future

11:21.048 --> 11:22.080
ahead of them.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.183
- [snorts]
Yeah.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.688
I'm sorry, was that out loud?

11:29.690 --> 11:32.057
- You got something
against marriage?

11:32.059 --> 11:35.326
- I mean, I'm sure
for plenty of people

11:35.328 --> 11:37.929
it's all sunshine and roses.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.130
- Then why so down on it?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.765
- Well, after they got married,

11:40.767 --> 11:43.935
my parents pretty much tried to
kill each other every day.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.771
Then my mom got hooked on heroin
and abandoned the family.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.406
So, not a big believer.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.475
- Trudy's been leaning on me
to pop the question.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.745
Might share that story,
if you don't mind.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.114
- Mouch.
- It's fine.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.883
I share it all the time.
It's a cautionary tale.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.787
- Sorry you went through that.
Sounds rough.

12:02.789 --> 12:03.955
- Don't be sorry.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.925
Just don't ask me
to marry you.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.031
- Yeah, I feel 100%, and I have
full clearance from my doctor,

12:13.033 --> 12:15.133
as you can see there.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.168
- Well, I'm glad to hear
that you're feeling better.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.404
But it's not just
the physical aspects of the job

12:19.406 --> 12:20.872
that I need to be worried about.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.342
- Oh, I feel good
on all fronts, Chief.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.512
- A firefighter's
emotional condition

12:27.514 --> 12:29.380
is just as important as
any other aspect

12:29.382 --> 12:32.050
of their fitness for duty.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.186
- Like I said, I'm both
physically and mentally

12:35.188 --> 12:36.788
cleared for duty.

12:36.790 --> 12:40.425
I'm sorry, I'm not exactly sure
what your concern is.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.095
- My concern is keeping drama
out of the firehouse.

12:46.433 --> 12:51.503
Am I hearing right--your
Lieutenant fathered this kid?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.305
- Uh...[coughs]
That's a personal matter.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.007
And I'd rather not discuss it.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.076
- The fact that you're becoming
distraught right now

12:58.078 --> 13:01.312
speaks directly to my concern.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.414
In my opinion, you are not
fit for duty at this time,

13:03.416 --> 13:05.116
and I'd advise you take
additional leave.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.851
- Okay, I'm not distraught.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.553
I'm angry.
Okay?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.488
Are you this worried
about male firefighters'

13:10.490 --> 13:13.124
emotional condition when they
return from medical leave?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.960
This isn't fair, and I am happy
to detail to the commissioner

13:15.962 --> 13:19.831
and whoever else will listen to
exactly how unfair it is.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.313
- [sighs]
Then, respectfully,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.215
I decline your advice,
and I will be going

13:37.217 --> 13:39.184

You okay?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.569

- You cleared for duty?

13:57.571 --> 14:00.171

Yeah, I am.

- Gabby, what'd he say?

14:08.081 --> 14:12.150

Doesn't matter, I--
the point is that I'm cleared.

make a name for himself.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.860
Get some attention.

14:21.862 --> 14:22.994
- What's going on?

14:22.996 --> 14:26.898
- Riddle got on her case.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.301
- It's nothing.
I'm over it.

Welcome.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.123
- We just wanted to say
thank you

14:52.125 --> 14:53.992
for everything you did.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.895
- My fiancé, David?

14:56.897 --> 15:02.300
He's...alive because of you.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.903
This is such a small gesture
by comparison,

15:04.905 --> 15:07.372
but we wanted to do something.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.943
The bakery where we got
the wedding cake

15:11.945 --> 15:15.046
makes really good sweets.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.916
- So how's David doing?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.951
- Getting better by the minute.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.587
And already trying
to reschedule the wedding

15:22.589 --> 15:26.124

back into town.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.531
- Hey.
- You okay, Dawson?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.934
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about
that out there.

15:35.936 --> 15:39.404

of doing things

15:49.516 --> 15:51.482
He brought up the baby.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.985
- No.
- Yep.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.621
Under the pretense that he was
gauging my fitness to return,

15:56.623 --> 15:59.624
but I know he was just
trying to provoke me.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.592
- Give me five minutes
with that guy.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.161
I don't care what color
his shirt is.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.562
- No, just because he's--

16:04.564 --> 16:08.466
- We are having
the wedding here.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.504
I'll be damned if Chief Riddle
or anyone else

16:13.506 --> 16:16.541
is gonna change my way of
running this house.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.582
He wants to fight.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.618
Then let's fight.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.190
- Okay, people,
we have a lot to do

16:32.192 --> 16:33.358
and not much time.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.993
We're doing this
tomorrow morning,

16:34.995 --> 16:36.327
so let's get to it.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.363
Um, I put us in charge
of flowers.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.597
- We can totally do that.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.266
- Okay, the family's pastor
can't be there,

16:42.268 --> 16:45.336
so we need a preacher
who can perform the ceremony.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.171
- Chaplain Orlovsky'll jump
at the chance.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.673
I'll call him.
- Great.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.176
And we need music.
Of course, a wedding march.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.045
And something for the reception.

16:54.047 --> 16:57.215
- Just need an iPod, right?
- Um, no, nice try.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.716
It's a wedding,
not a slumber party.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.318
Think you can do better
than that.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
- Back in high school, I was
part of an a cappella group,

17:02.322 --> 17:04.222
if that helps.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.624
- You serious?

17:06.626 --> 17:09.093
- See for yourself.

come up with, all right?

Opening our doors like this
for a wedding?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.058
Making a big scene?

17:40.060 --> 17:43.628
Any chance you're doing this
just to spite Chief Riddle?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.630
- My philosophy is that
our firehouse

17:45.632 --> 17:48.433
is a part of the neighborhood.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.885
Our doors are always open.

17:50.886 --> 17:53.336
- Chief, you've burned through
quite a bit of political capital

17:53.339 --> 17:55.740
over the past few weeks.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.176
Maybe it's time to start
laying low,

talking about

20:53.620 --> 20:55.319
is the wedding and
his bride-to-be.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.521
- Oh, see, a man runs into
a burning building

20:57.523 --> 20:59.257
to save the woman he loves.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.926
That's romance.
- Aww.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.961
- You want to hit up
the florist across the street,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.597
see what we can get?

21:06.599 --> 21:10.368
- You know what?
I've got a better idea.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.471
[beeping]

21:20.446 --> 21:22.913
- Hey, guys,
give us a hand?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.049
- What you got?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.817
- Ta-da.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.919
- Whoa, jackpot.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.924
- "With deepest sympathies."

21:33.926 --> 21:35.826
- Courtesy of
Shady Pines Mortuary.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.895
They were just gonna
toss this out!

21:37.897 --> 21:40.598
- I see--so you hate weddings,
but you'll find any excuse

21:40.600 --> 21:42.400
to hit up a funeral home.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.335
- You know it.
- My kind of girl.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.304
- We need to take a ride.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.806
- Where to?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.876
- I found Chaplain Orlovsky.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.955
- Who is this we're picking up?

22:04.957 --> 22:08.426
- So Walt goes running out
there, and sure enough,

22:08.428 --> 22:10.961
Bobby's taken
an acetylene torch

22:10.963 --> 22:14.065
and cut the roof clean off
of Walt's car.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.834
[laughter]
- Hey, good to see you.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.104
- Walt drove that thing around
for two whole weeks.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.106
In February!

22:22.108 --> 22:25.409
[laughter]

22:27.413 --> 22:30.548
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Matt Casey.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.849
- How are you?
- Yeah.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.553
You knew Bobby Dunbar, right?
- I did, yeah.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.089
- Hey, Gary, a round
for my friends here.

22:38.091 --> 22:41.559
We're gonna drink another toast
to Bobby D.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.960
He was one of a kind.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.830
- Look, another time, Padre.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.864
We're on duty.
- Yeah.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.716
- Oh.
- Wish we could.

22:48.717 --> 22:50.567
Listen, Chaplain, we need
your help with something.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.804
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Anything for you guys.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.874
Anything at all.
Wait, I just gotta--oh!

22:56.876 --> 22:59.744
- I got--oh, whoa, whoa.
- All right, hang on, whoa.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.813
Hang on, pops.
- Who moved the floor?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.782
- Uh, quick plan B, there's like
a hundred places

23:04.784 --> 23:06.650
online I can get ordained
overnight.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.486
- Otis, get the door.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.756
- [snores]

23:16.896 --> 23:19.063
[snoring]

23:19.065 --> 23:20.998
- Do I want to know?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.400
- [mouthing "no"]

23:22.402 --> 23:24.068
- Make sure he's tucked away
in the bunk room

23:24.070 --> 23:25.603
before Riddle arrives.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.604
- Sure.
[chuckles]

23:26.606 --> 23:27.872
Oh, and Chief?

23:27.874 --> 23:29.106
- Yeah?

23:29.108 --> 23:30.941
- What you're doing here,
with this wedding?

23:30.943 --> 23:32.410
- Uh-huh.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.545
- Not the smartest move
you've ever made.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.081
- Well, better
to die on your feet

23:37.083 --> 23:39.717
than live on your knees, Connie.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.989
- [snores]

23:44.991 --> 23:46.557
- [sighs]

23:50.830 --> 23:53.063
- You can knock, you know.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.599
- So are you gonna help us
with the flower arrangements?

23:55.601 --> 23:56.700
- Yeah, of course.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.103
I grew up working
in a flower shop.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.005
- Really?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.440
- Are you kidding me?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.707
A family of firefighters

24:03.709 --> 24:05.576
who drank testosterone
for breakfast?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.678
- [laughs]

24:09.549 --> 24:11.215
- So, what you said earlier.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.151
You got no family in Chicago?

24:14.153 --> 24:16.153
- My sister moved to
Kansas City.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.655
I've been trying to call her,

24:17.657 --> 24:20.124
but...she's a mess.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.893
- Oh,<i> she's</i> the mess?

24:22.895 --> 24:25.196
[both laughing]

24:25.198 --> 24:27.765
- Yeah, she just

24:27.767 --> 24:29.767
goes where the wind blows.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.136
But...must run
in the family.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.238
- So, let me get this straight.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.841
You're never gonna settle down,
that's the game plan?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.909
- Damn right.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.552
- Honestly, I can't tell
whether I'm doing

24:48.554 --> 24:50.654
a good job or a bad job here.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.523
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?

24:52.525 --> 24:57.127
Why don't you stick to taking
the condolence cards off?

25:01.801 --> 25:05.135
- Heads up.
It's the Riddler.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.570
- [exhales]

25:06.572 --> 25:09.573
<i> [tense music]</i>

25:09.575 --> 25:17.648
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:21.854 --> 25:24.688
- Why isn't Patterson here?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.526
Would you go get
Captain Patterson for me?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.127
- Yes, Chief.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.830
- What's with the flower shop
in your common room?

25:32.832 --> 25:35.566
- Family lost their home
day of their wedding.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.134
I'm offering 51
as an alternate venue.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.970
- An alternate venue, Wallace?
This is a firehouse.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.239
It's not the champagne room
at the Radisson.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.241
- I'm aware of that.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.242
I know it's a little unorthodox,
but I thought I would offer it.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.913
- Well, then, maybe
you should pull the plug.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.582
- That would be a very big blow
to the bride.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.083
The groom is laid up
at Chicago Med.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.251
[knocks on door]
- Sorry, I didn't realize

25:54.253 --> 25:55.553
I was expected at this meeting.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.954
- Come on in, Patterson.

25:56.956 --> 26:01.025
We're here to discuss
Kelly Severide's lieutenancy.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.993
Did you pass your course,
Severide?

26:02.995 --> 26:04.228
- With flying colors, sir.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.196
Your office is getting a copy of
my final review.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.731
- Congratulations.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.935
Why don't we put your leadership
skills to the test?

26:10.937 --> 26:13.837
As a reinstated officer,
would you support

26:13.839 --> 26:16.907
the use of a firehouse
for a private event?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.277
- Depends on the event, sir.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.112
- Well, I think you know that
I'm referring to

26:22.114 --> 26:24.882
this specific event,
this wedding.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.051
<i> [tense music]</i>

26:27.053 --> 26:29.653
- If I thought it
would help people?

26:29.655 --> 26:31.889
I'd support it, sure.
- Mm-hmm.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.658
- And I do.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.194
- I think we'll let Severide
stay right where he is

26:37.196 --> 26:39.897
for a while.
We'll reassess down the road.

26:39.899 --> 26:40.965
- Wait, what?
- Kelly.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.833
- Down the road?
No way.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.935
I passed your class.
I kept my head down.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.938
I did my job, like you asked.
Ask Patterson.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.608
- You don't think
I already have?

26:50.610 --> 26:51.942
- If he didn't give me
a positive review,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.277
then he's full of it.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.279
- Severide, I'm happy to discuss
this with you later.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.615
- I'm not talking to you.
- Kelly, that's enough.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.017
- You know,
it's no surprise to me

27:00.019 --> 27:03.887
that your people--Dawson,
Severide--thumb their nose

27:03.889 --> 27:06.357
at authority and backtalk
their superior officers.

27:06.359 --> 27:09.126
I know exactly where
they learned that behavior.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.262
- Riddle, you got a problem
with me,

27:12.264 --> 27:14.264
don't take it out on my men.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.800
That wedding was my call,
and I am happy to bring

27:16.802 --> 27:18.936
this discussion up
before the Commissioner,

27:18.938 --> 27:22.206
because he is not retired
as yet.

27:22.208 --> 27:27.277
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:27.279 --> 27:30.047
- All right, you do whatever
you think's best

27:30.049 --> 27:32.016
regarding this wedding, Chief.

27:32.018 --> 27:36.320
And as for you,
we will review down the road.

27:36.322 --> 27:44.294
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:44.296 --> 27:45.829
- Chief?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.398
I apologize for that,
Chief Riddle.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.867
I am embarrassed
on Severide's behalf.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.201
And, as far as
this wedding goes--

27:51.203 --> 27:53.137
- Look, just don't let yourself
get dragged down

27:53.139 --> 27:55.272
into this mess, Patterson.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.907
There may be
a Battalion Chief slot

27:56.909 --> 27:59.677
opening up very soon.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.215
- I'm so sorry, Severide.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.252
I did not mean for you to become
collateral damage.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.987
- To hell with him.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.757
He was never gonna give me my
bugle back anyway.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.697
Shove it up his ass, Chief.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.004
- Uh, we got some
jalapeno poppers,

28:27.006 --> 28:30.474
we got some wingdings,
got some mini-quiches,

28:30.476 --> 28:32.910
slightly freezer burned.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.345
- Not exactly
Gibsons Steakhouse, is it?

28:35.347 --> 28:37.748
You know what?

28:37.750 --> 28:40.150
You take yourself
down to the grocery store

28:40.152 --> 28:45.422
and you get some nice,
big platters and, uh...

28:47.860 --> 28:49.993
and a cake.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.029
- You got it, Chief.

28:55.034 --> 28:59.970
- Anything left over, you drop
it in Bobby Dunbar's boot.

28:59.972 --> 29:04.074
- Chief, we got a text
from the bride, Becca?

29:04.076 --> 29:06.110
- The groom took a bad turn.

29:06.112 --> 29:09.346
- Well, you report back
when you know anything.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.152
Go get the food, candidate.
Good thoughts.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.755
Good thoughts.

29:29.502 --> 29:32.102
- Hey, what happened?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.871
- Increased inflammation
in his airway.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.906
Not uncommon for inhalation
injuries to get worse

29:35.908 --> 29:37.374
before they get better.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.510
That's why we're keeping
an eye on him.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.514
- Hey, Becca, how you doing?

29:43.516 --> 29:45.115
- I'm okay.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.017
Dr. Halstead said the wedding's
giving David

29:47.019 --> 29:49.419
something to fight for.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.155
He's gonna pull through.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.024
And when he does,
he'll want to celebrate.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.426
- Good.
- Good, we'll be ready for him.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.895
<i> [monitor beeps]</i>

29:57.897 --> 29:59.296
- Oh, God.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.198
- Becca...

30:01.200 --> 30:02.399
- I'm here, David.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.802
- He's in SVT.
Heart rate's 200.

30:04.804 --> 30:07.171
- David, I need a big cough
from you.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.405
- [coughs]

30:08.407 --> 30:09.439
- Oh, come on, you can do better
than that.

30:09.441 --> 30:13.210
A lot harder, come on.
- [coughs]

30:13.212 --> 30:15.012
- Give me six of adenosine.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.814
Okay, folks, everyone needs
to clear out.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.216
- But--but he's awake.
- Please, step outside.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.051
- Come on, honey,
let's give 'em some space.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.555
[machines beeping]

30:24.557 --> 30:27.024
- Hang in there, David.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.159
- Adenosine given.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.328
Still in SVT.
BP's 90 over 60.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.897
- Bolus him 500 of NS,
another 12 of adenosine,

30:33.899 --> 30:35.098
and put the pads on.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.233
Let's get him set up
for a cardioversion.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.301
Start with 50 joules.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.302
- Midazolam?
- No, Ketamine.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.237
One milligram per kilo.
David?

30:40.239 --> 30:41.338
Can you hear me?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.340
We're gonna shock your heart.
Okay?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.442
We'll have you sedated,
but it's gonna be intense.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.977
Are you ready?

30:46.979 --> 30:48.011
All right, he's ready.

Let's go.
- 50 joules.

- Clear.

- Still in SVT.
Heart rate's 180.

BP's still 90 over 60.
- Bring it up to 100 joules.

- What do you think?

- I think ol' Bobby D'd be
proud of you guys.
