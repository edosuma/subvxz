WEBVTT

00:26.443 --> 00:28.028
Oh, God.

02:38.074 --> 02:42.453
He looks smaller than yesterday.
Is that possible?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.039
He's down three ounces.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.667
That much?

02:53.172 --> 02:54.215
It's good you're here.

03:02.807 --> 03:03.933
Hey there.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.520
Hey, Will.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.191
I know it's been rough so far.

03:15.695 --> 03:19.407
But I need you to fight, okay?
I need you to fight now.

03:27.415 --> 03:31.044
If you fight now,
I promise you that I will fight for you

03:31.127 --> 03:33.171
for the rest of your life.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
All right,
how many of these do we need?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.132
I've never seen you
throw yourself into a task

04:18.216 --> 04:20.009
with this much gusto before.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.970
What can I say?
I'm taking my vitamins.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.473
It has nothing to do
with that boy being here?

04:25.556 --> 04:28.393
No. And he's not a boy. Will's a boy.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.230
Okay, sure.
Yeah, whatever...

05:03.052 --> 05:06.180
It sure is.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.098
Yeah.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.767
Let's just hope to hell it works.

05:11.185 --> 05:15.481
How... How exactly will we know
that it works?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.651
You skipped Victor's speech?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.030
Yeah, that makes two of us.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.948
I'll give you the short version.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.534
The<i> Resolute</i> may be deaf,
but it isn't blind.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.705
So, uh, Victor thinks if he builds
a light tower bright enough--

05:30.788 --> 05:33.458
-It will be seen from space.
-Yeah.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.670
Just needs to coincide
with the orbit of the<i> Resolute.</i>

05:39.255 --> 05:42.467
-Well, the science people think so.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.426
What do you think?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.013
Right now, I just wanna make sure that
that robot doesn't wander in

05:47.096 --> 05:49.140
right in the middle of all this.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.017
He's gone?

05:51.642 --> 05:55.438
Yeah. Kids said it just... walked off.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.357
Interesting.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.901
These people are already on edge.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.278
Last thing we need
is that thing being drawn in

06:02.361 --> 06:04.447
when that big light gets turned on.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.453
Like a moth to a flame?

06:11.412 --> 06:12.246
Yeah.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.582
Something like that.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.800
Hey, excuse me.
I'll see you back down there.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.185
Let's see if this works.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.770
Hey.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.941
-Nope.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.527
Do you think it's coming back?

06:43.319 --> 06:44.195
I don't know.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.117
Well, there's only so many things
we can worry about at a time.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.328
-Trying to.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.997
-There's something I need to check on.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.252
I...

07:00.336 --> 07:03.589
I don't know.
Maybe Kepler's Law doesn't apply here,

07:03.673 --> 07:06.592
or... or maybe it's
the celestial mechanics of the system,

07:06.676 --> 07:08.719
or maybe I'm wrong
about the gravitational constant.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.846
-I--

07:11.139 --> 07:15.685
It's the sun.
It's rising earlier and earlier every day.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.563
Well, that's what happens on Earth.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.982
It's spring, right?
It's kinda nice the weather's changing.

07:21.065 --> 07:25.570
But it's the rate of change.
It's way too fast.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.990
I need to figure this out.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.953
Okay. I'll come with you.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.541
I'll be fine.
You should work with the kids.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.878
Make up for the time you lost.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.173
Look, I will call you if anything--

07:45.256 --> 07:46.799
<i>Hope you're not going</i>
<i>on a field trip.</i>

07:48.676 --> 07:49.927
We might need that Chariot.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.930
You be careful.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.892
Don't punch anyone.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.441
If the cables overheat,

08:03.524 --> 08:05.902
we'll need every available
Chariot battery as backup.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.695
Then we should make sure
they don't overheat.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.198
What's she doing, anyway?

08:10.781 --> 08:12.700
When she's ready to tell us, she will.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.786
Don't you have a meeting to lead?

08:21.834 --> 08:25.588
-We are applying the last of them.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.215
Good, good. And construction?

08:27.298 --> 08:29.342
We should be finished with the tower frame
by midday.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.385
And what about electrical?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.888
We're about 100,000 watts short
of our candela target.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.556
How'd that happen?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.975
A team member shorted the lights
in the testing phase.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.727
We don't have time for mistakes.

08:39.810 --> 08:43.731
You're welcome to take
the <i>Jupiter 2</i> NAV lamps if you want.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.733
If that gets you where you need to be.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.194
Uh, yeah. It should.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.239
Wish I'd thought of that.
I would've got some sleep last night.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.116
Okay. Problem solved.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.452
We good?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.079
I suppose.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.918
But, uh, we need more Mylar foil.
The coverage is patchy.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.880
Well, let's stop standing around.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.472
That tower is some science project.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.392
It's actually
a really interesting concept.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.562
Yeah, and apparently one that requires
lots of heavy lifting.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.732
Something that a particular R-O-B-O-T

09:26.816 --> 09:29.610
-could come in handy for.
-She's got a good point.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.904
You guys said
I could wait for the right time.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.198
I did.
But isn't this the perfect opportunity

09:34.282 --> 09:35.825
to show everyone how useful he could be?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.328
So you should tell Dad,
as soon as possible.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.873
He's gonna be fine, okay,
once he has a chance to process it.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.585
And to get through
the five stages of anger,

09:45.668 --> 09:47.378
from furious to mad to PO'ed--

09:47.461 --> 09:49.922
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.466
-When he's in a good mood.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.176
You can't wait that long.  Wait that long for what?

10:00.975 --> 10:01.809
Huh?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.522
To tell you that Will refuses
to unload his insulation.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.441
He says it's too itchy.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.321
Come on, that's not like you.
Just wear a pair of work gloves.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.947
Okay.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.370
He's avoiding me, isn't he?

10:22.496 --> 10:26.000
Maybe you should ask Will
if you have questions about Will.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.088
Dad, you can talk to him. Okay?

10:31.464 --> 10:32.465
Just be yourself.

10:33.591 --> 10:37.219
Actually, no. Maybe be, like, 20% nicer.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.660
Need a hand?

11:01.994 --> 11:02.870
Yeah.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.168
Ah, think I'm gonna need a tutorial.

11:11.671 --> 11:17.093
So, red can go to black,
and black can go to red,

11:17.676 --> 11:19.470
but green always goes to the ground.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.141
You're a pretty smart kid, you know that?

11:24.934 --> 11:28.854
Thanks,
but I'd take brave over smart any day.

11:28.938 --> 11:33.401
But bravery without intelligence,
that's a very risky thing.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.614
Haven't seen your robot in a while.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.783
Do you miss it?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.327
I guess.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.000
Can you do me a favor?

11:52.336 --> 11:53.254
What?

11:53.337 --> 11:57.716
Well, um, there's something I need to do.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.512
Something that's very important.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.975
And I need the robot's help to do it.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.436
I was thinking,
maybe if you knew where it was,

12:08.519 --> 12:11.981
that maybe you could... bring him here.

12:12.064 --> 12:12.898
I...

12:12.982 --> 12:14.108
Dr. Smith?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.360
Don.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.613
Oh, my God.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.783
You made it. I'm so relieved.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.703
Yeah. I'm relieved I made it too.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.080
Do you need anything?
Can I get you some water?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.206
Let me get you some water.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.877
Sure. Maybe that's where my flare gun is.
Next to the water.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.546
You know, the flare gun you stole
when you left me for dead?

12:35.629 --> 12:39.133
I would never do that. It was an accident.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.303
So you stole it out of my pack
by accident?

12:42.386 --> 12:43.220
Well...

12:44.680 --> 12:46.932
I took it out because I was scared.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.895
I thought about shooting it off,

12:50.978 --> 12:54.773
but I knew what you'd say,
that you'd be annoyed.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.067
So I put it back.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.736
But in the wrong bag.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.948
I've been feeling so guilty.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.786
Now you're here.

13:09.663 --> 13:13.959
Okay. Okay. Don't beat yourself up.
We both made it.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.089
You know, I... I think I saved you.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.301
You... What?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.805
My St. Christopher medal.
It protected you.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.683
It brought you good luck.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.769
Do you still have it?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.396
The necklace?

13:35.856 --> 13:36.774
No.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.861
No, I lost it. In the storm.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.739
Yeah.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.823
I forgive you.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.621
I gotta go. So we'll talk later, okay?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.373
<i> Is it dangerous?</i>

15:18.834 --> 15:20.502
Nothing we wouldnâ€™t be prepared for.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.133
Are you asking us or telling us?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.803
This an important family decision.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.306
Everyone has to be on board.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.266
All right, pros and cons.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.769
Okay, start with Earth. Uh...

15:37.102 --> 15:41.023
Pro: governments have stabilized,
for the most part.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.901
Pro: the World Cup.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.154
Pro: my friends are here.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.954
Cons: If we stay here,
we won't ever see another blue sky,

15:55.537 --> 15:56.705
or a rainbow.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.832
And as for future Robinsons,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.335
there won't be much life left here
for them.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.089
And Alpha Centauri?

16:05.923 --> 16:08.634
Pros: It's habitable.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.804
It's a... It's a paradise planet.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.766
There's no wars. There's no instability.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.689
You could build whatever.
You could be whatever you want there.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.526
Pro: blue skies.

16:28.320 --> 16:34.243
Con: It's a one-way ticket.
There's no coming back. Ever.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.497
You're right. It's a really big decision.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.208
What does Dad think?

16:41.792 --> 16:45.129
He... wants what's best for everybody.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.756
So he's coming?

16:49.717 --> 16:50.926
Uh, if he can.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.936
Judy, only the best of the best get to go.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.063
They could fast-track your medical career.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.067
And Penny,
what about first author in space?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.571
Can anyone go?

17:10.904 --> 17:13.323
Anyone who passes the tests.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.451
There's more than one?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.535
Don't worry.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.871
You'll all pass.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.636
Hello?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.264
-Oh! Ow!

18:19.348 --> 18:23.602
Son of a... Ow! Yeah. It's broken. Ow!

18:24.186 --> 18:27.564
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let a man prepare.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.069
I'm not the first person
to break your nose, am I?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.278
What do you think?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.906
Who taught you self

18:35.989 --> 18:39.910
-It's Judy. My dad taught me.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.996
Yeah. John Robinson's my dad.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.168
He came into the picture after I was born.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.547
-Not particularly.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.050
What are you doing with all of that booze
in our Jupiter?

18:56.468 --> 18:57.553
Sensitive issue.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.765
-I'm sort of like a importer-exporter.
-Smuggler.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.561
What is the matter with you Robinsons?
You make it sound like a bad thing.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.728
Is it?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.939
Obviously never had single malt Scotch,
have you?

19:16.697 --> 19:17.739
How's Angela?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.493
Hard to tell.
She doesnâ€™t come out of her cabin.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.913
Does she talk much?
About what happened on the<i> Resolute?</i>

19:25.414 --> 19:28.041
-Checking on my patient.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.710
Wait.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.338
I'm curious
as to how such a big baby

19:33.422 --> 19:34.965
survived such a big storm.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.178
Honestly? I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.138
I didn't think any of us were.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.729
I just held my breath
for as long as I could.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.691
Starts the pounding of blood
in your ears, right?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.862
Louder and louder until you think
your head might explode.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.450
Exactly.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.704
-Ow! Ah!

20:07.789 --> 20:11.043
Oh! You have serious anger issues.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.836
Oh!

20:13.378 --> 20:15.464
You said "us"
when you were in the storm.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.424
You mean you and Angela, right?

20:17.507 --> 20:22.638
Yeah. Yeah.
And, uh, some shrink named Dr. Smith.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.182
No, we rescued her.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.269
Guessing by the look on your face
she didn't mention me?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.563
No, she said she was alone.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.945
I bet she did.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.583
Hey. You're a tough guy to track down.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.295
-I thought you wanted me to help.
-Yeah. Yeah. I did.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.300
Hey, you might want
to run those in parallel.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.720
That way if one of the lamps shorts,
the others won't go out as well.

21:04.137 --> 21:08.976
-Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.608
I'm sorry I missed so many.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.486
Christmases.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.657
It's okay. You were saving the world.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.243
No, I wasn't there and, uh...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.330
I know that bothered you.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.709
Just like something's bothering you
right now.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.215
The robot.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.135
I know how close you got.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.680
Just upped and left.
What do you think about that?

21:47.931 --> 21:52.102
Um... I... I, um...

21:52.185 --> 21:53.312
'Cause I think it hurt.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.774
Just like it hurt when I left.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.820
But I want you to know,

22:02.738 --> 22:04.239
I'm not going anywhere.

22:08.785 --> 22:11.621
I missed a lot and, um...

22:14.541 --> 22:17.961
I know that we don't always
get each other, but...

22:20.964 --> 22:21.840
I'm here now.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.474
One thing's for sure, it...
it kind of hogged all your time.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.767
So, uh...

22:33.185 --> 22:36.646
The upside is that we get to spend
all that time together. Right?

22:37.773 --> 22:38.690
Yeah.

22:39.941 --> 22:40.901
Yeah.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.448
Okay. What do we got going on here?

22:46.531 --> 22:49.076
Try and plug that one in there
to run to the power box.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.251
How'd you manage
to get these other ones in?

23:13.350 --> 23:16.019
Why are you setting these up here?
This is the cable path.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.229
I'm sorry.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.106
I need these moved
to the other side of the tent

23:19.189 --> 23:21.775
-before the first team breaks for lunch.
Yes, sir.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.276
Use your head.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.755
Sorry your dad sucks.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.300
At least he figured out a way
for us to signal the<i> Resolute.</i>

23:47.384 --> 23:48.760
Good point.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.891
Um, thanks for keeping our secret
about you-know-what.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.060
I'm not keeping it.
You're blackmailing me.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.646
Or did you forget?

24:00.689 --> 24:03.567
-Wow. No quippy comeback.
-Okay, give me a second.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.361
Okay. One, one

24:07.571 --> 24:10.699
Maybe I'll have one by the time
I'm done helping you.

24:13.743 --> 24:17.247
I can't wait to eat real food again.

24:17.330 --> 24:21.334
-The beef ravioli ones aren't that bad.
-Yeah. Until you've had, like, 20.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.760
Is it from here?

24:31.887 --> 24:32.929
What?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.222
You know.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.057
Oh. Uh...

24:36.892 --> 24:38.977
I'm not sure.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.188
-It's a robot.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.065
I know, but its face,
those swirling lights. It...

24:44.900 --> 24:46.943
It looked like
it was thinking.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.990
How long am I gonna
have to keep your secret?

24:52.073 --> 24:54.201
Until it's not a secret anymore.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.165
-Because you can't.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.920
Your parents don't know. Do they?

25:07.047 --> 25:10.592
-Uh, in my experience, yes.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.094
A lot.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.098
Know what?
I think I'm done helping you for today.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.654
You got it?
Got it? Yeah. Here we go.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.952
Heard all about your crash-landing.

25:37.661 --> 25:41.039
-Don. He said he almost died.

25:41.957 --> 25:42.832
Oh.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.127
We all thought we were going to die.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.548
But he said that he was waiting for you.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.591
Uh...

25:52.592 --> 25:55.011
Judy, be careful.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.888
What do you mean?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.975
He's not who you think he is.

26:01.851 --> 26:05.105
When we crashed,
Don's friend died on impact.

26:06.106 --> 26:10.777
He stole her boots right off her feet.
Like it was nothing.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.529
He wouldn't even bury her.

26:13.321 --> 26:17.117
-Yeah... Yeah, well, with the storm--
-There was no storm yet.

26:18.743 --> 26:22.497
I was the one who buried her.
Someone had to.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.417
And the survivor...

26:26.042 --> 26:28.878
-Yes, Angela.

26:30.755 --> 26:31.923
She needed help.

26:33.675 --> 26:37.178
But he... He just hid under a rock.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.764
He wanted to wait the storm out.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.893
It was like he didn't care
if she lived or died.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.859
Then I was the one
who had to search for help.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.279
Why did you tell us you were alone?

26:55.780 --> 26:58.116
Honestly? I wanted to protect you.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.786
I wanted to protect your family.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.958
I should get back to work.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.210
Okay.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.519
Come on, Will. You can do it.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.522
Stay calm.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.462
-Hey.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.923
You did great. Sit down.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.010
You okay?

28:42.178 --> 28:44.013
I didn't pass, did I?

28:46.307 --> 28:48.059
It's just a practice test.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.438
But if I don't pass, no one gets to go
to Alpha Centauri, right?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.611
Will, listen to me.
You won't remember this, but when you were really little,
you and I made a deal.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.075
And you kept your end of the bargain.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.496
And now it's my turn.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.528
The light tower is ready to go.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.740
Good work. Naoko, how long
before they'll be able to see us?

29:43.823 --> 29:46.159
The <i>Resolute </i>will be in range
in 20 minutes.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.076
Good.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.662
It will be nice
to finally hear a different message,

29:49.746 --> 29:52.916
from, "We're looking for you,"
to "We see you."

29:56.127 --> 29:58.463
What do you have?

29:58.546 --> 30:01.299
Oh, my God, this is incredible.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.100
Light it up.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.373
-We did it.
-Yeah.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.400
Wow. It's incredible. Beautiful.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.675
Like moths to a flame.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.516
What are those things?

31:34.809 --> 31:35.685
Bugs.

31:35.768 --> 31:39.063
They're positively phototactic.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.649
I think you mean positively disgusting.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.903
As opposed to negatively phototactic.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.072
It means they're attracted to light.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.330
Uh, okay.

31:56.039 --> 32:01.085
Do you want herb chicken or peanut butter?

32:04.088 --> 32:05.548
I like to mix 'em.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.843
Really

32:10.887 --> 32:13.431
I saw you talking to Dad.
Did he freak out?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.478
You didn't tell him?

32:25.568 --> 32:26.569
Don't move.

32:32.033 --> 32:35.161
-No! No, no! No!
-You're making it worse. Just hold still.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.418
Nice hair. You look great.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.672
Thanks.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.409
<i> Warning.</i>
<i>Hawking radiation detected.</i>

34:04.125 --> 34:05.418
Fu--

34:16.220 --> 34:18.806
Is it all packed up?
Yeah, it's in the Chariot.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.781
Best night here by far.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.616
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.203
What a story we'll have
when we get to Alpha Centauri.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.747
One I could have done without.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.295
I... I didn't know
how to tell you this before,

34:49.378 --> 34:51.506
because I didn't want to interfere
with family matters,

34:51.589 --> 34:53.925
but there's something
I think you should know.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.720
It has to do with the robot.

35:00.056 --> 35:00.890
What?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.601
When you and Maureen were away,

35:05.686 --> 35:09.982
Will took the robot out into the woods.
I... I think the girls went too.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.653
I assumed that they told you.
I thought at least Will would have.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.702
Excuse me.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.757
Will.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.221
Where's the robot?

35:41.347 --> 35:42.306
I don't know.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.351
Why are you lying to me?

35:45.935 --> 35:48.813
I'm not. I mean, I didn't mean to.

35:49.939 --> 35:54.193
I mean, I didn't want to. I... I just--

35:54.277 --> 35:59.699
-He was different before.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.577
What are you talking about?

36:05.413 --> 36:10.001
You know how something happened
on the<i> Resolute,</i> and then we all crashed?

36:10.084 --> 36:11.294
Yeah.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.381
It was because of him.

36:16.215 --> 36:20.678
I don't know why, but he was there.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.764
He hurt some people.

36:24.473 --> 36:27.185
No. Will, people died.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.438
But he saved me. He saved Judy.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.274
He protected us in that storm.
He's good now.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.609
Did he hurt you?

36:34.692 --> 36:38.112
I can control him.
I made him promise to never do that again.

36:38.196 --> 36:42.241
Will, you're just a kid.
You can't control anything.

36:42.825 --> 36:47.246
Where is it

36:49.749 --> 36:52.043
I thought I raised you better than this.

36:53.669 --> 36:54.754
Is that why you hid it?

36:55.171 --> 36:57.298
Because you were worried
it was gonna hurt us?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.217
No.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.557
I was afraid of what you would do to him.

37:11.979 --> 37:12.939
What the hell?

37:16.943 --> 37:18.069
Oh, no!

37:30.748 --> 37:32.375
Quick! Run!

37:32.458 --> 37:34.627
Get away from the tower! Find cover!

37:34.710 --> 37:35.711
I'll take him.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.338
Go! Go, go, go!

37:38.297 --> 37:39.131
Penny!

37:40.967 --> 37:41.884
Judy!

37:44.470 --> 37:46.847
Vijay! Vijay, get down.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.017
Over here! Get down!

37:53.062 --> 37:54.939
Stay down!

38:42.737 --> 38:44.071
Call your robot.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.615
Who cares if anyone sees it now?

39:55.434 --> 39:58.521
<i>This is Captain Radic </i>
<i>broadcasting from the</i> Resolute,

39:58.604 --> 40:00.856
<i>day seven, 1900 hours. </i>

40:00.940 --> 40:04.402
<i>We have yet to detect any survivors,</i>
<i>but we'll redouble...</i>

40:17.289 --> 40:19.417
-Dad.
-I got you, Penny. Come on!

40:33.055 --> 40:34.807
Dad, why aren't we running?

40:36.016 --> 40:39.562
If we turn our backs,
we haven't got a chance.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.523
Will, they're in danger.
We all are.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.193
Where are you?

40:50.823 --> 40:51.657
You see this?

41:35.826 --> 41:38.204
You've got to be kidding me.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.256
Run now.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.182
Robinsons. Over here!

42:10.277 --> 42:11.612
He won't fight back.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.532
Because I told him.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.495
That was a mistake.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.075
Fight back.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.913
Please, fight back.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.625
Fight back.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.342
You have to be like you were before.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.513
You have to be bad.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.350
Do it.

43:24.518 --> 43:27.021
Be bad.

44:13.525 --> 44:14.985
Get back. Just step back.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.118
No, no, not them.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.081
No!
-Will! Will, no!

44:32.336 --> 44:33.337
It's me.

44:37.925 --> 44:38.801
Will.

44:38.884 --> 44:40.135
That's it.

44:44.682 --> 44:45.557
That's it.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.438
It's me.

45:04.243 --> 45:05.285
It's me.
