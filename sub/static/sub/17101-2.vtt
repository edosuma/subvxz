TO PUT IT ON THE AGENDA

21:28.421 --> 21:30.523
FOR THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY,

21:30.623 --> 21:34.461
BUT, SO FAR THE ONLY THING
THAT SHE HAS DONE IS TO GIVE ME

21:34.561 --> 21:36.929
A BUNCH OF EXCUSES.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.399
UH-HUH.

21:40.767 --> 21:44.504
JUSTIN CROWE, YOU HAVE NOT
HEARD A WORD THAT I'VE SAID.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.172
UH...

21:46.272 --> 21:48.941
IS THAT A NEW DRESS ?

21:49.041 --> 21:52.812
NO, IT'S NOT
A NEW DRESS !

21:57.750 --> 22:00.787
( female singing on radio )

22:00.887 --> 22:04.624
SOMETHING WRONG ?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.763
EXCUSE ME.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.332
NORMAN !

22:13.433 --> 22:14.801
CHILDREN.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.136
TARDY AS USUAL.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.072
I'M SORRY WE'RE LATE.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.342
OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.611
DID YOU
SEE THE CAR ?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.078
YOU DIDN'T.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.347
I DID,
JUST OUTSIDE.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.816
THE BUICK PHAETON.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.117
SILVER AND BLACK.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.219
RUNS LIKE
A GREYHOUND.

22:33.319 --> 22:36.456
SALINAS TO MINTERN
IN JUST OVER AN HOUR.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.357
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T
GET IN A CRACK-UP.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.993
DID I MENTION
IT'S A CONVERTIBLE ?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.228
TEA, PLEASE.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.397
EVERY PROPHET
IN HIS HOUSE.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.132
EXCUSE ME ?

22:46.232 --> 22:50.102
I SAID,
COMING RIGHT UP.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.170
HONESTLY, NORMAN.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.839
A MAN OF YOUR AGE--

22:52.939 --> 22:55.041
SHOULD ENJOY THE BLESSINGS
THE GOOD LORD BESTOWS ON HIM

22:55.141 --> 22:57.309
WHILE THERE IS
STILL TIME.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.712
YOU'RE TURNING
INTO A RAKE.

22:59.812 --> 23:03.115
JUSTIN, YOU BETTER SNAP THIS
LITTLE GIRL BACK INTO LINE.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.351
I'M SORRY ?

23:05.452 --> 23:07.820
YOUR SISTER JUST
CALLED ME A RAKE.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.788
OH.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.558
HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS
ALL WEEK.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.661
SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU, SON ?

23:14.761 --> 23:17.830
I JUST HAVE A LOT
ON MY MIND.

23:17.930 --> 23:22.802
WELL THEN, MAYBE THIS WILL
MAKE YOU STAND UP AND SALUTE.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.938
NO MORE BABE RUTH, PLEASE,
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY TALKS ABOUT.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.574
OF COURSE IT IS.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.909
MIGHTY ENDEAVORS
ARE INSPIRING.

23:30.009 --> 23:30.977
THERE'S NOTHING INSPIRING

23:31.077 --> 23:32.712
ABOUT A MAN HITTING
A BALL WITH A STICK.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.414
I COULD SAY THE SAME THING
ABOUT A YOUNG MAN

23:35.515 --> 23:37.183
THROWING ROCKS
WITH A SLING.

23:37.283 --> 23:40.587
NORMAN BALTHUS, DON'T YOU DARE
COMPARE DAVID TO BABE RUTH.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.355
YOU JUST WATCH ME,
LITTLE GIRL.

23:43.456 --> 23:47.326
IN DESPERATE TIMES,

23:47.426 --> 23:50.429
THE GOOD LORD
LOOKS OVER THE FLOCK

23:50.530 --> 23:54.834
AND CHOOSES ONE MAN
TO INSPIRE THE MULTITUDES.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.237
ONE MAN TO ACCOMPLISH
THE IMPOSSIBLE.

23:58.337 --> 24:03.409
ONE MAN TO OFFER HOPE WHERE
THERE WAS ONLY HOPELESSNESS.

24:03.510 --> 24:07.780
AND WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE
THE WISDOM OF THE ALMIGHTY ?

24:07.880 --> 24:11.718
HE CHOOSES HIS SERVANTS
TO FIT HIS PLAN.

24:11.818 --> 24:15.421
AND WHEN HE CHOOSES HIS SERVANT
FROM AMONG THE FLOCK

24:15.522 --> 24:18.390
AND GIFTS THEM
WITH TALENTS,

24:18.491 --> 24:22.895
IT IS A GRAVE SIN
TO BURY THEM IN THE EARTH.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.669
AMEN.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.839
AMEN.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.508
AMEN.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.046
( chattering )

24:44.817 --> 24:47.587
WHO SHALL LADY LUCK
SMILE UPON NOW ?

24:47.687 --> 24:50.857
A NICKEL WINS A SAW-BUCK,
A SAW-BUCK WINS A FIVER !

24:50.957 --> 24:53.159
FORTUNE IS ONLY
ONE SPIN AWAY !

24:53.259 --> 24:54.527
YOU SIR !

24:54.627 --> 24:55.461
YOU LOOK
LIKE A WINNER !

24:55.562 --> 24:56.996
STEP RIGHT UP...

24:57.096 --> 24:59.131
JUST FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS
NORTHERN EYE-TALIAN BEAUTY.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.802
THIS IS THE WOMAN ALL THE MEN
IN TOWN BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.972
SHE'S GONNA SHAKE IT,
SHE'S GONNA BREAK IT,

25:06.072 --> 25:08.908
SHE'S GONNA TEAR IT
DOWN TO THE GROUND

25:09.008 --> 25:11.744
'CAUSE MISS FRANCESCA
HERE IS SO, SO HOT,

25:11.844 --> 25:15.782
SHE'S GONNA PUT BLISTERS
ON YOUR EYEBALLS.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.838
THE CARDS
ARE UNCLEAR.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.607
I'M SORRY.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.975
IS THAT BAD ?

25:43.075 --> 25:44.944
COME ON.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.652
SO YOU'RE GONNA
BE A CHILD.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.188
WELL, WE'VE
GOTTA EAT, OKAY ?

25:57.757 --> 25:59.626
DON'T TRY TO CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.293
THE POINT IS,
I ALREADY ASKED HIM,

26:01.393 --> 26:04.296
HE SAID NO,
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.267
YES, IT IS.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.639
FOLKS, WE'RE CLOSED.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.306
( groaning )

26:14.406 --> 26:16.308

I GOTTA STALL.

26:47.674 --> 26:48.675

26:48.775 --> 26:50.877

26:51.978 --> 26:53.680

28:08.855 --> 28:12.191
OH MR. TEMPLETON,
PLEASE COME IN.

28:13.559 --> 28:16.195
JUSTIN,
MR. TEMPLETON'S HERE.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.430
HELLO, CARROLL.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.867
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULDN'T COME BY.

28:20.967 --> 28:21.934
OF COURSE
I CAME BY.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.469
SAID I WOULD,
DIDN'T I ?

28:23.569 --> 28:24.837
YES, YES,
YOU CERTAINLY DID.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.105
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.375
IRIS, HOW ABOUT SOME
OF THAT COLD LEMONADE ?

28:30.542 --> 28:31.944
WELL...

28:32.044 --> 28:34.747
I HAVE A PROJECT IN THE WORKS
THAT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.016
BUT I'M GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.318
I HAD A FEELIN'
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.920
WHAT KIND
OF PROJECT ?

28:41.020 --> 28:42.755
WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER
THIS MORNING WHEN YOU SAID

28:42.855 --> 28:44.190
IT WAS GETTING
CROWDED IN CHURCH ?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.324
OH, YEAH.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.193
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.160
MY WIFE AND I--

28:48.260 --> 28:49.661
I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S THE MIGRANTS.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.597
THEY NEED A PLACE
TO COME AND WORSHIP,

28:51.697 --> 28:53.065
BUT OUR CHURCH IS
ALREADY OVERCROWDED.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.002
SO WHAT THEY NEED
IS A PLACE OF THEIR OWN.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.772
NOW SEE, I WAS JUST SAYIN'
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO EMMA

28:59.872 --> 29:01.240
NOT AN HOUR AGO.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.241
IS THAT RIGHT ?

29:02.341 --> 29:03.575
YES, SIR.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.011
WELL, HOW CAN I HELP
YOU OUT, REVEREND ?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.545
WELL, THERE'S A BUILDING
DOWN ON STATE STREET.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.579
I BELIEVE
YOU OWN IT.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.081
CHIN'S ?

29:09.181 --> 29:09.982
THAT'S THE ONE.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.450
I WANT YOU
TO GIVE THAT TO ME.

29:11.550 --> 29:15.955
( laughing )

29:18.324 --> 29:20.126
I'M SORRY.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.495
DID I UH, DID I SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY ?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.865
YEAH, THAT'S
A REAL HOWLER.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.400
TURNIN' CHIN'S INTO
A CHURCH FOR THE OKIES.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.668
I'M QUITE SERIOUS.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.938
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.306
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

29:34.406 --> 29:36.809
WOULD $50 WORK ?

29:36.909 --> 29:38.344
THEY CAN GET THEMSELVES
A NICE TENT FOR 50--

29:38.444 --> 29:39.778
NO, NO.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.480
THE LORD HAS
SPOKEN TO ME.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
HE WAS QUITE CLEAR.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.018
I WANT CHIN'S.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.555
THE LORD HAS
SPOKEN TO YOU.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.190
THAT'S CORRECT.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.594
MAYBE HE SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
THAT PROPERTY'S NOT FOR SALE.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.831
ARE YOU MOCKING ME,
MR. TEMPLETON ?

29:58.931 --> 30:01.233
I'M JUST SAYIN'
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.270
AND I'M JUST SAYING I HAVE
NO INTENTION OF BUYING IT.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.304
NO ?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.438
YOU WILL DONATE IT.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.107
TO YOU ?

30:08.207 --> 30:11.543
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, REVEREND,
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.814
HOW DARE YOU TAKE THE LORD'S
NAME IN VAIN IN THIS HOUSE !

30:21.954 --> 30:25.491

35:28.260 --> 35:30.596
IN THE BOY'S DREAMS.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.931
DON'T CARE.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.833
SCUDDER'S DEAD.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.302
HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.538
ON THE CONTRARY,
SCUDDER'S ALIVE AND WELL.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.007
HOGWASH.

35:42.107 --> 35:45.010
BUT YOU WILL TELL MANAGEMENT,
WON'T YOU ?

35:45.110 --> 35:48.847
I'D DO IT MYSELF,

35:48.947 --> 35:51.717
BUT HE WON'T LISTEN
TO ME ANYMORE.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.118
HE USED TO.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.855
BUT EVER SINCE
ST. LOUIS.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.860
WELL, THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE ST. LOUIS.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.331
NO.

36:07.299 --> 36:11.770
SAMSON, WE SHOULD
HEAD SOUTH.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.305
CIRCUIT TAKES US NORTH.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.241
THE CIRCUIT'S
JUST AN EXCUSE.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.975
YOU KNOW THAT.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.345
WE'RE HEADIN' NORTH.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.888
THANKS FOR THE WHISKEY.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.342
ALRIGHT, BOYS.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.677
WE'RE DOWN
FOR THE NIGHT.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.614
GET SOME SHUT-EYE,
SEE Y'ALL IN THE MORNING.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.383
ALRIGHT, JONESY.

37:34.252 --> 37:38.590
WE WERE ALWAYS STRONGER
TOGETHER THAN APART.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.330
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LET ME IN...

37:54.072 --> 37:55.741
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

37:55.841 --> 37:57.509

37:57.609 --> 37:58.844
WELL, GET THE HELL OUT !

40:34.299 --> 40:36.468

42:34.319 --> 42:35.386
SHE WALKED
OVER TO ME--

42:35.486 --> 42:36.722
SHE CAN'T WALK.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.624
SHE CAN'T
EVEN MOVE.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.058
EVERYBODY
KNOWS THAT.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.526
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'

42:41.627 --> 42:43.862

43:05.583 --> 43:06.952
WE DON'T HAVE
NO SORTIN' OUT TO DO.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.987
THE KID DIDN'T
DO NOTHING WRONG.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.056
CUT HIM LOOSE !

43:16.828 --> 43:18.563

43:18.664 --> 43:21.466

43:25.236 --> 43:27.639

WORKED THE GEEK-SHOW.

46:53.811 --> 46:57.315
REAL RUMMY.

46:57.415 --> 47:00.418
POOR BASTARD NEVER MET
A BOTTLE HE DIDN'T LIKE.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.820

47:02.921 --> 47:05.924

47:20.171 --> 47:24.943

47:28.613 --> 47:31.049
WELL, NOW...

47:32.750 --> 47:35.987

DOWNRIGHT QUEER.

47:37.889 --> 47:42.527
YOU MIND IF
I KEEP THIS ?

48:00.912 --> 48:02.880
THIS, THIS SCUDDER,

48:02.981 --> 48:04.549
DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT'VE
BEEN IN THE WAR ?

48:04.649 --> 48:06.217
COULD'VE BEEN.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.020
LOTS OF CRAZY MEN
IN THE WAR...

48:09.120 --> 48:13.624
CRAZY AS MUD-BUGS
ON A GRIDDLE.

48:31.542 --> 48:35.646
( female )
GABRIEL, COME ON
INSIDE NOW.

50:07.038 --> 50:09.674
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

50:09.774 --> 50:13.111
WELCOME TO OUR NEW TEMPLE,

50:13.211 --> 50:15.480
OUR NEW HOME...

50:15.580 --> 50:17.882
OUR...

50:17.982 --> 50:19.950
SANCTUARY.

50:20.051 --> 50:23.621
HERE IT IS, WE WILL
BEGIN OUR HOLY TASK,

50:23.721 --> 50:26.391
OUR MISSION...

50:26.491 --> 50:30.661
TO BRING IN THE MULTITUDES
WHO ARE NOW LOST TO GOD.

50:32.297 --> 50:35.600
THE MULTITUDES WHO WOULD
OTHERWISE PERISH FOREVER

50:35.700 --> 50:40.171
WHEN HIS SWORD IS
LOOSED UPON THE WORLD.

50:42.207 --> 50:44.175
( gunshot )

50:53.518 --> 50:55.986
( male on radio )
Did you really think you could
hide from me, Carla ?

50:56.087 --> 50:58.389
( female )
Get out or I'll call
the police.

50:58.489 --> 50:59.324
Go ahead.

50:59.424 --> 51:00.758
Hello... ?

51:00.858 --> 51:01.959
Hello, Operator... ?

51:02.059 --> 51:02.993
Oh no.

51:03.094 --> 51:04.462
No !

51:04.562 --> 51:05.496
Oh yes.

51:05.596 --> 51:07.365
You see, I cut the line
with this knife.

51:07.465 --> 51:10.935
The same knife I used to kill
that nosy old bag next door.

51:11.035 --> 51:12.703
It was you !

51:12.803 --> 51:13.804
Yes, and once
she was dead,

51:13.904 --> 51:15.072
it was only
a matter of

51:15.173 --> 51:16.807
leaving behind some
incriminating evidence.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.277
Joe's wallet.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.311
Yes.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.946
I picked his pocket
on the train platform.

51:22.046 --> 51:23.281
The fool had
his nose--

51:23.381 --> 51:25.416
( shutting off radio )

51:31.256 --> 51:34.525
OH, I SAVED YOU
SOME SUPPER.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.461
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

51:36.561 --> 51:39.497
A LONG DAY ?

51:41.031 --> 51:42.600
WE HAVE
A NEW CHURCH.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.370
WE DO ?

51:45.470 --> 51:47.538
CHIN'S.

51:47.638 --> 51:50.508
THAT GAMBLING HALL
DOWN IN CHINATOWN ?

51:50.608 --> 51:53.578
BROTHER TEMPLETON DONATED IT
TO OUR NEW MINISTRY...

51:53.678 --> 51:56.080
FOR THE MIGRANTS.

51:56.181 --> 51:58.082
THE MIGRANTS ?

51:58.183 --> 52:00.651
THE FLOCK I'VE BEEN
CHOSEN TO LEAD.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.354
CHOSEN BY THE LORD GOD.

52:03.454 --> 52:07.592
HE SPOKE TO ME, IRIS.

52:08.859 --> 52:11.596
AND I SHALL
CARRY OUT HIS WILL.

52:15.333 --> 52:17.001
PRAISE THE LORD.

52:17.101 --> 52:19.904
AMEN.

52:20.004 --> 52:22.440
( crying )

52:28.313 --> 52:31.416
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
JUSTIN.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.187
HE'S CHOSEN...

52:36.287 --> 52:39.324
SUCH A GOOD MAN.

53:43.421 --> 53:50.795
* JUST AS MY HEART WAS,
AFTER THE BALL *

53:50.895 --> 54:01.071
* A LITTLE MAIDEN CLIMBED
AN OLD MAN'S KNEE *

54:01.171 --> 54:11.582
* BEGGED FOR A STORY,

54:11.682 --> 54:21.225
* WHY ARE YOU SINGLE,

54:21.326 --> 54:31.769
* HAVE YOU NO BABIES,
HAVE YOU NO HOME *

54:31.869 --> 54:42.012
* AFTER THE BALL IS OVER,
AFTER THE BREAKS OF MORN *

54:42.112 --> 54:52.657
* AFTER THE DANCERS' LEAVING,

54:52.757 --> 55:01.666
