WEBVTT

00:01.975 --> 00:02.808
Oh for the --

00:03.376 --> 00:05.877
We're already late, what'd
ya go and start that for?

00:05.945 --> 00:07.179
I didn't!

00:07.247 --> 00:09.948
So, it just
spontaneously combusted.

00:10.016 --> 00:13.485
So creepy...
look, I've got goosebumps.

00:13.553 --> 00:14.586
I'm sure you do.

00:14.654 --> 00:16.821
What is --
is something burning?!

00:16.889 --> 00:17.622
No!

00:17.690 --> 00:18.924
Maybe you're having a stroke!

00:18.991 --> 00:20.426
I'm not having a stroke!

00:20.493 --> 00:23.395
That's great, Mother, keep
those periodic updates coming!

00:23.463 --> 00:24.263
Oh shut up.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.065
Hey, Friday happy
hour, you guys in?

00:26.132 --> 00:26.665
Gimme that.

00:26.732 --> 00:29.935
No no no no no that's not --

00:30.002 --> 00:30.669
-- water.

00:30.736 --> 00:32.003
Well what the hell was it?!

00:32.072 --> 00:33.038
Grappa.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.874
- Aww...
- No shit, that was like twenty bucks' worth.

00:35.942 --> 00:37.276
Who drinks a
pint of grappa?!

00:37.343 --> 00:39.678
Well nobody
now, Wendy Wasteful.

00:39.745 --> 00:41.480
So you can buy my first
couple of rounds.

00:41.548 --> 00:43.715
- Nah, I can't, we --
- No, you can.

00:43.783 --> 00:44.983
I'm allowing you.

00:45.051 --> 00:48.287
- Oh my God, thank you
- You're welcome.

00:48.354 --> 00:49.588
but we've got dates.

00:49.655 --> 00:51.523
Meaning the
fruit of the date palm?

00:51.591 --> 00:52.591
Muh-huh.

00:52.658 --> 00:54.560
Date dates, dingdong.

00:54.627 --> 00:55.294
With who?

00:55.361 --> 00:58.197
Oh, just some
handsome firemen I met.

00:58.264 --> 00:59.264
At a warehouse fire.

00:59.332 --> 01:01.200
So c'mon, let's go already!

01:01.267 --> 01:03.168
My cooch has cobwebs on it.

01:03.236 --> 01:04.135
Ew.

01:04.203 --> 01:05.804
Krieger, hey, wanna get a drink?

01:05.871 --> 01:08.507
Oooooooooooooh, no.

01:08.575 --> 01:12.211
- It's mushi night, movie and sushi
- With... oh.

01:12.278 --> 01:13.878
Meaning that's tentacle porn.

01:13.946 --> 01:15.947
"Fisherman's Wife"
and "Fisherman's Wife Two:"

01:16.015 --> 01:17.349
"The Re-Tentacling."

01:19.519 --> 01:22.053
Mother, hey,
wanna go get a drink?

01:22.122 --> 01:24.055
You know, as a
matter of fact, I do.

01:24.124 --> 01:28.026
- Oh, okay, uh --
- And as another matter of fact, I am.

01:28.094 --> 01:30.429
With Ron, in the bar
at The Tuntmore.

01:30.497 --> 01:35.867
And if he plays his cards right, he'll
be wetting a lot more than his --

01:36.769 --> 01:37.302
Oww!

01:37.370 --> 01:38.370
What is wrong with you?!

01:38.438 --> 01:40.139
Well for one
thing, tinnitus!

01:40.206 --> 01:43.775
Which... Yeah, I think
it's getting worse.

01:43.843 --> 01:46.811
And how do they all have dates,
these aren't people you date,

01:46.879 --> 01:50.815
I'm who should have a date,
I'm the... best at dates.

01:50.883 --> 01:53.084
Hmm, I wonder if
Lana has a date.

01:53.153 --> 01:54.119
Yes!

01:54.187 --> 01:56.054
- Lana?
- Yes!

01:56.122 --> 01:58.357
- You heard that?
- Yes!

01:58.424 --> 01:59.758
Who're you,
Jaime Sommers?

01:59.825 --> 02:00.459
Yes!

02:00.527 --> 02:03.895
No seriously, I can barely hear me,
are my ears really that messed up?

02:03.963 --> 02:06.131
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:06.199 --> 02:09.364
Okay, Jesus, I'm not deaf,
I'm just --

02:09.490 --> 02:11.861
Going to vomit.

02:11.904 --> 02:13.104
I am going to vomit.

02:13.173 --> 02:14.706
Not on my
carpet, you're not!

02:14.774 --> 02:20.045
I -- Oh for God's
sake, get a room!

02:20.812 --> 02:22.013
We did.

02:57.593 --> 03:01.662
Shut up, because first of all...
I don't have to explain myself to you,

03:01.730 --> 03:04.132
of all people, and --

03:04.200 --> 03:07.468
-- and if you blow that
thing again the next time you

03:07.536 --> 03:10.838
hear it'll be when some whore
is giving you a blow job.

03:10.907 --> 03:13.041
Doesn't even make sense.

03:13.109 --> 03:17.178
I think she means she'll
shove it up your --

03:17.246 --> 03:19.180
Dickhole, and where
did you get that?!

03:19.248 --> 03:20.715
Rape prevention class.

03:20.783 --> 03:24.419
Which, turns out, is a
not-good place to meet women.

03:24.486 --> 03:25.253
No shit.

03:25.321 --> 03:29.324
Yeah, it's like their guard is
so up, it's -- Cyril, scotch, where?!

03:29.392 --> 03:31.526
Well if you mean my
grandfather's Glengoolie Blue,

03:31.593 --> 03:33.995
you drank it and then puked
it into my trash can!

03:34.063 --> 03:37.132
Oh my God, Lana I get,
she wants to make me jealous,

03:37.199 --> 03:39.901
but are you seriously just
getting me back for the scotch?!

03:39.969 --> 03:42.237
Do you even hear yourself?

03:42.305 --> 03:43.671
It honestly
kinda comes and goes.

03:43.739 --> 03:47.742
Well, since thanks to you I didn't
do the former, now we're doing the latter.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.277
Cyril, go start the car.

03:49.345 --> 03:51.413
- Are you not going--
- Cyril?

03:51.480 --> 03:53.348
Remember the ground
rules for this?

03:53.416 --> 03:55.951
So carefully negotiated?

03:56.018 --> 03:57.718
I will go start the car.

03:57.786 --> 04:01.789
- And before you say it --
- How long's it been since you got laid, Lana?

04:01.857 --> 04:04.159
That's not why I'm
dating Cyril again!

04:04.226 --> 04:07.429
- Uh-huh, so two --
- No! Not two years!

04:07.496 --> 04:10.198
Ass.

04:10.266 --> 04:11.466
Fourteen months.

04:11.533 --> 04:12.934
So go ahead, laugh.

04:13.002 --> 04:13.468
At what?

04:13.535 --> 04:14.836
I was gonna say two weeks.

04:14.903 --> 04:21.176
Two years is... Lana, that's the --
third saddest thing I've heard today.

04:21.243 --> 04:24.512
Pam told me about a little girl who
drowned trying to save a puppy.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.415
Jesus... what was
the second saddest?

04:27.483 --> 04:29.985
The puppy drowned too.

04:30.052 --> 04:35.623
But it's a close third, I mean don't do this,
Lana, c'mon, I'd be happy to bang you.

04:35.691 --> 04:38.093
Me and anybody who
could fog a mirror.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.496
Well before, maybe, but I
really think I've changed, Ya know!

04:41.563 --> 04:42.897
And-or matured!

04:42.965 --> 04:43.664
Ha.

04:43.732 --> 04:48.803
No, I'm serious, with the cancer,
and my possible father dying, and um...

04:48.871 --> 04:50.305
oh my God, the tinnitus?!

04:50.373 --> 04:52.240
- Archer...
- Hang on, should we get that?

04:52.308 --> 04:53.441
Get what?

04:53.509 --> 04:55.576
Is the phone not...?

04:55.644 --> 04:58.346
Damn you, tinnitus,
you're a cruel mistress!

04:59.681 --> 05:00.748
But seriously, do
you not hear that?

05:00.816 --> 05:01.983
Yes, now!

05:02.051 --> 05:02.817
It's your phone!

05:02.885 --> 05:04.886
Oh. Duh.

05:04.953 --> 05:09.090
Wait please, Lana, c'mon, you can't
deny we're attracted to each other!

05:09.158 --> 05:09.724
So?!

05:09.791 --> 05:12.693
So what if all that
stuff really has matured me?

05:12.761 --> 05:15.363
I know I'm not perfect, but
you have to admit I'm better!

05:15.431 --> 05:16.131
Than?

05:16.198 --> 05:17.932
Than I was!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.901
And also than Cyril
could ever be.

05:19.968 --> 05:23.905
- First of all, Cyril --
- Cheated on you as much as I did, Lana,

05:23.972 --> 05:27.442
- and I'm ten times handsomer than
him, so...   -  They're the same!

05:27.510 --> 05:29.744
Lana, be
honest with yourself.

05:29.811 --> 05:31.779
It was actually
about ten times worse.

05:32.981 --> 05:35.183
What happened to your
idiot voicemail?!

05:35.251 --> 05:39.921
I'm doing this new thing, where
now it just rings, drives people crazy.

05:39.988 --> 05:42.557
- Oh my God, you have matured...
- Lana, I have!

05:42.624 --> 05:43.724
Just let me prove it!

05:43.792 --> 05:44.359
If.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.163
In some crazy parallel
universe I agreed to that.

05:48.230 --> 05:49.297
How would you.

05:49.365 --> 05:54.369
By -- Jesus, hang on, Woodhouse
might be trapped in the dumbwaiter again.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.870
He was in there two
days last time.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.339
Your apartment's one level,
how do you have a dumbwaiter?

05:58.407 --> 05:59.840
Goes sideways.

05:59.908 --> 06:01.609
Mmmmmmmmyello?

06:01.677 --> 06:03.278
Speaking.

06:03.345 --> 06:04.579
Uh-huh.

06:04.646 --> 06:06.481
Uh-huh.

06:06.549 --> 06:08.349
Uh-huh.

06:08.417 --> 06:09.551
Uh-huh.

06:09.618 --> 06:11.286
Uh-huh.

06:11.353 --> 06:12.954
Okay, bye.

06:13.021 --> 06:14.189
Yes!

06:14.256 --> 06:16.424
Okay, Lana, check you later.

06:16.492 --> 06:17.392
What?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.726
What about all that just now?

06:18.794 --> 06:19.760
All what just now?

06:19.828 --> 06:22.663
About how much you've matured,
and how you want to get back together?

06:22.731 --> 06:23.698
That's what you heard?

06:23.765 --> 06:26.267
Wow, your ears are
even worse than mine.

06:26.335 --> 06:28.436
Wait, was that
even Woodhouse?

06:28.504 --> 06:29.170
Nooop!

06:29.238 --> 06:31.272
Then who was it?!

06:34.076 --> 06:39.214
Yes, my dear
Sterling, come for me.

06:39.281 --> 06:41.449
Phrezzing, boom.

06:49.122 --> 06:51.891
Hey, asshole!

06:58.298 --> 06:59.165
Thanks.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.835
And oh, my name is Cyril Figgis.

07:26.277 --> 07:29.646
Hey, how's it going?

07:29.713 --> 07:32.048
Thenk you,
they are beautiful.

07:32.116 --> 07:36.219
Sorry about the chocolate, I
didn't know you were allergic or whatever.

07:36.287 --> 07:37.420
The alkaloids.

07:37.488 --> 07:40.056
They can make a problem
with my bioelectronics.

07:40.124 --> 07:41.525
Oh. Right.

07:41.592 --> 07:42.792
Because you have those.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.727
And I'm sorry
if you misunderstood.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.896
I did not call you
for the romance.

07:46.964 --> 07:53.002
I -- yeah I mean yeah,
no, duh, and besides I wouldn't

07:53.070 --> 07:55.672
be interested, I have
a girlfriend, so.

07:55.739 --> 07:56.406
Oh.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.141
Yeah, an actress.

07:58.209 --> 08:00.610
Of stage and screen.

08:00.678 --> 08:01.311
Oh.

08:01.379 --> 08:03.446
Well, I hope she
makes you happy.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.749
Is funny, you don't
ask where is Barry.

08:06.817 --> 08:10.987
What do you mean where is
Barry, he's -- Yeah, where is Barry?

08:11.055 --> 08:16.926
I... I don't know!

08:16.994 --> 08:21.498
And only one week after, well, you
know, when I left you for him,

08:21.566 --> 08:24.133
he said he must go
for work, to London.

08:24.202 --> 08:27.837
- Wow, that was months ago...
- And since then, nothing!

08:27.905 --> 08:30.473
Not a word!

08:30.541 --> 08:32.708
What could have
happened to him?!

08:32.775 --> 08:37.179
- Uhhh...
- Noooooooooooooooooooo!

08:37.248 --> 08:38.948
He is on space station?!

08:39.015 --> 08:39.716
But why?!

08:39.783 --> 08:44.421
Well, ya know, I hate to say
this, but obviously he met someone else.

08:44.488 --> 08:45.955
Sterling. Pliz.

08:46.023 --> 08:49.559
Yeah, that was the -- third
dumbest thing I've ever said.

08:49.627 --> 08:51.861
Wait, what
were the first two?

08:51.929 --> 08:55.732
Buddy, you
just sold a timeshare!

08:55.799 --> 08:58.668
Make that two timeshares!

08:58.736 --> 09:02.672
- Goddamn maintenance fees...
- Sterling, will you please help me find him?

09:02.740 --> 09:03.172
How?

09:03.241 --> 09:05.041
That office was just a trailer.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.075
Barry.

09:06.143 --> 09:08.245
Oh. Barry, right.

09:08.312 --> 09:10.146
Pliz, Sterling.

09:10.214 --> 09:18.321
If you ever truly loved me, you
will help Barry to come home to me.

09:18.389 --> 09:20.257
'kay.

09:20.324 --> 09:23.260
Okay, lemme get this straight...
You wanna help psycho

09:23.327 --> 09:27.364
cyborg supervillain Barry, who's trapped
in space like General frickin Zod,

09:27.431 --> 09:29.999
get back to earth so
she'll dump him for you?

09:30.067 --> 09:30.600
Right?

09:30.668 --> 09:33.236
When Barry gets back she'll
realize what a dick he is,

09:33.304 --> 09:38.174
so she'll need somebody to talk to, so enter
Sterling Archer, the sensitive friend!

09:38.242 --> 09:39.942
What is
this, Opposite World?

09:40.010 --> 09:42.279
Yeah, right?

09:42.346 --> 09:45.282
Oh for -- this is
not Opposite World.

09:45.349 --> 09:48.084
- I think in her mind that mean
- God, okay!

09:48.152 --> 09:49.886
This is Opposite World!

09:49.953 --> 09:50.787
Whew!

09:50.854 --> 09:53.022
Um, okay, and since
certain people around

09:53.090 --> 09:55.258
here may not see how
brilliant my plan is,

09:55.326 --> 09:56.859
- they're gonna need to be --
Convinced?

09:56.927 --> 09:59.763
I'm sorry, did
you say incapacitated?

09:59.830 --> 10:03.300
- Because, Krieger, I can't have the--
- Responsible people?

10:03.367 --> 10:04.534
Naysayers!

10:04.602 --> 10:07.637
Walk in on you while you're
helping Barry build a rocket!

10:07.705 --> 10:09.939
Barry The
Unstoppable Psycho-Cyborg.

10:10.007 --> 10:11.708
He's not
unstoppable anymore!

10:11.776 --> 10:14.377
Ray's got bionic legs!

10:14.445 --> 10:17.614
But if you don't wanna see two
robots smashing each other with

10:17.682 --> 10:22.018
cop cars and shit as they fight to the
death through the streets of Manhattan...

10:22.085 --> 10:23.186
Bup bup bup bup bup!

10:23.253 --> 10:24.854
Stop.

10:24.922 --> 10:27.256
My penis can only get so erect.

10:27.325 --> 10:29.693
HOLOGRAM: Honntou ne...
[Very true...]

10:29.760 --> 10:31.127
I was tired!

10:31.195 --> 10:32.462
Ew.

10:39.670 --> 10:40.937
Cyril?

10:41.004 --> 10:41.538
What.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.976
Ew.

10:47.044 --> 10:48.545
Ray?

10:48.612 --> 10:49.145
What.

10:50.815 --> 10:53.082
Seriously, how
is that even a genre?

10:53.150 --> 10:54.784
And is this just
jackoff central?

10:54.852 --> 10:57.253
Ugh, not with all
this damn racket!

10:57.321 --> 10:58.988
Wh-? Why aren't
you in position?!

10:59.056 --> 11:01.023
I am, this is how I do it!

11:01.091 --> 11:02.058
Wh-? Ewww!

11:02.125 --> 11:03.326
I meant with Mother!

11:03.394 --> 11:04.126
Oh.

11:04.194 --> 11:05.462
I put Cheryl on that.

11:05.529 --> 11:07.797
Great, Miss
Opposite World?!

11:07.865 --> 11:10.467
You heard
me, do not go in there.

11:10.534 --> 11:12.134
Why, what are
you hiding this time?

11:12.202 --> 11:15.739
Probably another one of
her so-called mystery fires.

11:15.806 --> 11:20.510
Lana, I said no!

11:20.578 --> 11:24.848
Okay, so where's
the... fire.

11:28.285 --> 11:30.353
Worst. Day. Evah!

11:30.421 --> 11:31.454
Okay status report!

11:31.522 --> 11:32.622
Mother in there?

11:32.690 --> 11:33.256
No.

11:33.323 --> 11:34.957
Carol, open
this damn door!

11:35.025 --> 11:38.160
- Um, okay, now I just need to find
- Cheryl!

11:38.228 --> 11:39.328
And neither is Lana.

11:39.397 --> 11:40.162
Nice!

11:40.230 --> 11:44.901
Hey excellent job, seriously--
Ow! I mean... totally shit job?

11:44.968 --> 11:45.602
Cheryl!

11:45.669 --> 11:46.403
Thank you.

11:46.470 --> 11:49.639
- So when I said this is Opposite World --
- Pam.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.808
The important thing
is that I'm happy.

11:51.876 --> 11:54.176
Try not to overthink it.

11:54.244 --> 11:57.313
I just wanna help you finish
your new spaceship, why is that weird?

11:57.381 --> 12:00.417
Why is that weird -- Because my
sworn purpose in life is to murder your

12:00.484 --> 12:01.451
little buddy Archer?

12:01.519 --> 12:02.151
Archer?

12:02.219 --> 12:04.854
No way man, I hate that guy!

12:04.922 --> 12:05.522
Since when?

12:05.589 --> 12:08.591
Since, um, he
slept with my girlfriend!

12:08.659 --> 12:11.260
Dattara iinoni...
[I wish.]

12:11.328 --> 12:11.895
Keep it up.

12:11.962 --> 12:13.496
God, that is
just classic Archer!

12:13.564 --> 12:14.230
Right?

12:14.298 --> 12:17.333
I mean, not a huge surprise,
from a self-centered alcoholic

12:17.401 --> 12:19.185
who feels compelled to
sleep with every woman

12:19.211 --> 12:20.762
he meets because
that's the only way to

12:20.805 --> 12:23.339
fill the emptiness inside where
his mother's love should -- ow!

12:23.407 --> 12:24.774
Do what?

12:24.842 --> 12:26.309
One sec?

12:26.376 --> 12:27.209
What the shit?!

12:27.277 --> 12:29.712
What, you said be convin--
Convincing!

12:29.780 --> 12:31.047
Not deliberately hurtful!

12:31.114 --> 12:31.948
Well?!

12:32.015 --> 12:32.982
Yo, asshole!

12:33.050 --> 12:34.116
What're we doing here?

12:34.184 --> 12:35.819
Fixing that
spaceship, buddy!

12:35.886 --> 12:38.054
Looks like it's just
about done, huh?

12:38.121 --> 12:41.724
Yeah, those scientists
were pretty resourceful.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.125
Until they all died.

12:43.193 --> 12:46.663
And how did
they, um, all die?

12:46.730 --> 12:49.799
Oh... different ways.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.167
'kay.

12:51.234 --> 12:52.569
Swift and severe.

12:52.636 --> 12:56.305
The punishment will
be swift and severe.

12:56.373 --> 12:59.141
I mean it, Lana, that
girl is out of here.

12:59.209 --> 13:02.979
Aww, and right when she was gonna
invest ten million dollars in ISIS.

13:03.046 --> 13:04.180
She said that?!

13:04.247 --> 13:07.650
Oh my God, that phony
prospectus must've worked!

13:07.718 --> 13:09.452
Do you think the
money's in here?!

13:09.520 --> 13:11.721
Come on, help me
look in these boxes!

13:11.789 --> 13:12.321
Malory!

13:12.389 --> 13:13.523
What?!

13:13.591 --> 13:15.024
Oh.

13:15.092 --> 13:16.125
Dammit.

13:16.193 --> 13:20.096
So yeah... Krieger's helping
Barry finish his rocketship,

13:20.163 --> 13:23.666
and when he gets home he can...
tell you about the other woman.

13:23.734 --> 13:24.333
The what?!

13:24.401 --> 13:26.035
Wait, how'd we
get to another woman?

13:26.103 --> 13:28.671
Oh my God, do you
have proof of this?!

13:28.739 --> 13:33.309
- No, I -- can probably get some...
- Oh, Sterling!

13:33.377 --> 13:37.647
- If Barry really is cheating on me...
- And also if I prove it somehow...

13:37.715 --> 13:39.382
Then he will
be dead to me!

13:39.449 --> 13:43.319
Because I will kill him
with my bare hands!

13:43.387 --> 13:48.791
Yeah, or not, since then there's
no reason for him to come home at all!

13:48.859 --> 13:49.559
What's that?

13:49.627 --> 13:50.860
Nothing, what?

13:50.928 --> 13:53.029
Oh, you mean that?

13:53.096 --> 13:56.465
Sorry, that's... just
a sympathy boner.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.243
Oww!

14:03.311 --> 14:04.211
Woooo!

14:04.278 --> 14:06.714
Cyril Figgis strikes again!

14:15.156 --> 14:15.989
Status report!

14:16.057 --> 14:17.091
Terrible!

14:17.158 --> 14:19.359
Wait, what
hap -- goddammit!

14:19.427 --> 14:20.293
What?!

14:20.361 --> 14:21.661
Dude, assimilate!

14:21.730 --> 14:24.131
Are Mother and
Lana still in the vault?

14:24.199 --> 14:24.798
No.

14:24.866 --> 14:26.499
I -- rrgh!

14:26.567 --> 14:30.104
A situation, by the way,
for which I blame you entirely.

14:30.171 --> 14:31.939
How is this my fault?!

14:32.006 --> 14:36.176
You were the -- holy shit, there really
are nerve gas canisters up here!

14:36.244 --> 14:37.911
I thought that was a joke!

14:37.979 --> 14:39.312
How is that funny?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.081
Because I said so.

14:41.149 --> 14:42.349
What's this
even written on?

14:42.416 --> 14:43.951
A bar bill,
and just do it.

14:44.018 --> 14:45.953
Forget about actually
fixing the rocket.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.421
But what about
the robot fight?!

14:48.489 --> 14:50.590
And why are you
beating on shit?!

14:50.658 --> 14:52.226
Because shit is stuck!

14:52.293 --> 14:52.726
Dude!

14:52.794 --> 14:54.128
It's not a frickin tractor!

14:54.195 --> 14:56.930
Yeah, that's what all the
space-nerds up here kept saying.

14:56.998 --> 14:59.933
Until Other Barry just
couldn't stand it anymore.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.101
I --
Krieger!

15:01.169 --> 15:03.737
Forget the robot fight and
just read the damn script!

15:03.805 --> 15:06.406
Then upload the audio
to the mainframe!

15:06.474 --> 15:08.375
Okay, either Barry!

15:08.442 --> 15:11.344
I need you to find a female
co-ax bus connector.

15:11.412 --> 15:14.614
What's a female...
whatever look like?

15:14.682 --> 15:15.482
Pam!

15:15.549 --> 15:16.784
Pam!

15:16.851 --> 15:18.118
Paaaaaam!

15:18.186 --> 15:19.052
Whaaat?!

15:19.120 --> 15:22.222
C'mon, I need your help on --
wait, what were you doing in there?

15:22.290 --> 15:22.990
Nothin.

15:23.057 --> 15:24.457
But don't go in there!

15:24.525 --> 15:25.926
No, huh-uh!

15:25.994 --> 15:29.163
That's how Mother and Lana
wound up locked in the vault!

15:29.230 --> 15:32.199
- A situation, by the way, for which--
I heard you!

15:32.267 --> 15:32.699
C'mon!

15:32.767 --> 15:35.102
You're still into all that
stupid AV stuff, right?

15:35.170 --> 15:39.015
Uh... Not reeeally...

15:39.041 --> 15:42.701
- Okay, so screw those in...
- Wait... all of 'em?

15:42.743 --> 15:44.377
Dammit
man, I said screw!

15:44.445 --> 15:46.079
I am screwing!

15:46.147 --> 15:48.215
Wow, this
might actually work.

15:48.283 --> 15:49.116
What's that?

15:49.184 --> 15:50.784
I said why
not use this one.

15:50.852 --> 15:52.152
No! Gimme that!

15:52.220 --> 15:53.420
Why, what's on here?

15:53.487 --> 15:55.222
Nothing! Jesus!

15:55.290 --> 15:56.690
Christ, Ray!

15:56.757 --> 15:58.058
Is it too much to ask?!

15:58.126 --> 15:59.326
Just once?!

15:59.393 --> 16:04.531
To be unconscious in a bathroom without
being sexually assaulted by -- you, um...

16:04.598 --> 16:05.933
...have a dart in your neck.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.901
Oh. So do you.

16:07.969 --> 16:09.069
Oh.

16:09.137 --> 16:11.939
- Sorry I accused you of, um...
- It's okay.

16:12.006 --> 16:14.041
C'mon, let's find our --

16:16.878 --> 16:19.412
- Noooooooooooooooooooo!
- Noooooooooooooooooooo!

16:19.480 --> 16:22.649
Yes... owww!

16:22.717 --> 16:23.450
Will you focus?!

16:23.517 --> 16:25.518
That's as good
as I can get it!

16:25.586 --> 16:26.486
Dicknuts!

16:26.554 --> 16:30.790
Shut up, okay, then that'll have
to do, so make a tape or whatever, and --

16:30.859 --> 16:34.761
So, just a quick heads up,
Ms. Archer and Lana are still in the vault.

16:34.829 --> 16:35.729
Wh-?

16:35.796 --> 16:37.204
Then why are you bothering--

16:37.230 --> 16:38.323
- Carol!
- Cheryl!

16:39.433 --> 16:41.701
Pam you better
not be making pornos!

16:41.769 --> 16:42.469
'kay!

16:42.536 --> 16:43.603
Tape, woman, tape!

16:43.671 --> 16:44.905
Okay, here!

16:44.973 --> 16:47.207
Dicknuts!

16:56.417 --> 16:58.818
I'm afraid I
have some bad news.

16:58.887 --> 17:02.722
Now, the audio's a little rough, ya
know, it's from outer space, but --

17:02.790 --> 17:03.556
Sterling, pliz!

17:03.624 --> 17:04.892
I want to hear it.

17:04.959 --> 17:08.161
- Well, Katya, you say that...
- Barry?

17:08.229 --> 17:09.729
Barry it's me, Archer.

17:09.797 --> 17:11.131
That's not me,
talking to Barry.

17:11.199 --> 17:11.564
Shh!

17:11.632 --> 17:12.432
Classic Archer!

17:12.500 --> 17:14.166
That's Barry, talking to--
Shhhhh!

17:14.234 --> 17:17.064
Yeah so listen, Katya
asked me to call you...

17:17.089 --> 17:17.796
Shit.

17:17.838 --> 17:19.606
She's wondering
why you left.

17:19.673 --> 17:21.875
Because couldn't
stand it anymore.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.512
So you lied
to her about being on

17:24.539 --> 17:26.671
- the space station because--
- Archer.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.681
I am screwing!

17:28.749 --> 17:29.349
Female.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.084
Scientists up here all of 'em?

17:31.752 --> 17:33.987
Oh, I was
gonna ask which one but--

17:33.993 --> 17:34.712
All of 'em?

17:34.755 --> 17:36.049
All of 'em?
All of --

17:36.056 --> 17:37.791
- Okay Barry, I --
- Different ways.

17:37.858 --> 17:38.558
Like?

17:38.626 --> 17:39.092
In.

17:39.160 --> 17:39.893
Asshole!

17:40.995 --> 17:42.095
Okay, Barry!

17:42.163 --> 17:46.133
Jesus, have some--

17:46.200 --> 17:47.134
Katya, baby, don't!

17:47.201 --> 17:50.037
C'mon, you'll -- wait, does
that even hurt your hands?

17:50.104 --> 17:53.473
The only thing
that hurts is my heart!

17:53.541 --> 17:58.178
And when Barry gets back, his heart
will hurt, because I will rip it out!

17:58.246 --> 18:01.014
What if... Barry
wasn't coming back?

18:01.082 --> 18:03.183
But you said Krieger
was fixing rocket.

18:03.251 --> 18:07.887
Yeah, but only because he wanted
to see an epic robot fi -- oh, shit!

18:07.956 --> 18:09.056
Will you excuse me?

18:09.123 --> 18:10.857
For a sec?

18:12.660 --> 18:14.761
No no no no no no no no!

18:14.829 --> 18:16.063
Yes!

18:16.130 --> 18:17.397
I think that's got 'er, dude!

18:17.465 --> 18:19.333
Told you it was
the viscous coupling!

18:19.400 --> 18:21.234
Well goody,
you win space camp.

18:21.302 --> 18:25.872
So tell Archer I'm coming for him,
phrasing, boom, and both Barrys out!

18:25.940 --> 18:27.274
Krieger!

18:27.342 --> 18:30.543
Why is Barry rocket-shipping away
from the frickin space station?!

18:30.611 --> 18:33.413
Because Newton's
Third Law of Motion?

18:33.481 --> 18:35.715
Hey thanks,
Neil deGrasse Tyson!

18:35.783 --> 18:38.213
Oooooh,
deGrasse Tyson-san...

18:38.239 --> 18:40.912
How the hell
did you fix his ship?!

18:40.955 --> 18:42.356
I gave you a bunch of gibberish!

18:42.423 --> 18:45.425
I may have gone
a teeny bit off script?

18:45.493 --> 18:46.026
Wh-?

18:46.094 --> 18:47.461
What is wrong with you?!

18:47.528 --> 18:48.295
With me?

18:48.363 --> 18:50.297
Dude, robot fight.

18:50.365 --> 18:53.533
- Oh, and Barry said tell you he's--
I heard him!

18:53.601 --> 18:55.702
Okay, I'll tell Katya to pack
a bag and we'll move to,

18:55.769 --> 19:00.207
Alaska or somewhere else snowy,
where he can't track us!

19:00.274 --> 19:01.341
Doesn't
even make sense.

19:01.409 --> 19:03.543
You know what
doesn't make sense?!

19:03.611 --> 19:05.912
The number you have dialed
has been disconnected or is --

19:05.980 --> 19:07.147
Nooooooooooooooooooo!

19:07.215 --> 19:08.648
longer in service.

19:08.716 --> 19:09.349
Goodbye.

19:12.253 --> 19:15.155
Hey, punkin pie!

19:15.223 --> 19:18.858
Dun't give me your pie of pumpkin,
Barry, you are in the big trouble!

19:18.926 --> 19:20.260
- I --
- I told you!

19:20.328 --> 19:22.695
I said dun't try to kill
Sterling and what do you do?!

19:22.763 --> 19:23.763
Um, that.
