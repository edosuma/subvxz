WEBVTT

00:07.383 --> 00:10.341
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up,
I'm up, I'm up.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.009
Aeryn!

00:13.097 --> 00:14.462
What the hell's going on?

00:14.557 --> 00:15.842
We've been locked and targeted.

00:15.933 --> 00:16.763
Crichton:
Peacekeepers?

00:16.851 --> 00:19.217
Aeryn:
No, them.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.015
Who are they?

00:22.106 --> 00:23.721
Pilot:
I don't know, Crichton.

00:23.816 --> 00:27.024
Their ship is is badly damaged
and their Comms channel's
not functioning.

00:27.111 --> 00:30.444
Have we sent the "don't shoot
us, we're pathetic"
transmission yet?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.943
It's the first thing we tried,
but they still targeted us.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.820
What did we do to piss
these guys off?

00:34.911 --> 00:36.822
Nothing we're aware of.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.323
D'Argo:
Rygel, | just boostered
another cable.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.915
Is the Defense Shield working?

00:39.999 --> 00:44.242
No, it still registers only
half power. Move it, D'Argo.

00:44.337 --> 00:47.829
I don't want to die because
you're too slow.

00:47.924 --> 00:51.462
If you can do any better get
down here yourself, your
lowness, and give it a try.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.713
Now, get me another cable!

00:53.804 --> 00:56.762
We just have to hope that
Zhaan can stall them.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.305
Zhaan?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.303
Zhaan's on their ship?

01:02.647 --> 01:09.189
Pilot, I've autodocked and
I'm coming toward what I
think is their command.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.018
There's no one here, though.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.024
We're still targeted, Zhaan.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.106
Perhaps they've automated
their weapons.

01:15.201 --> 01:18.068
You must find a way to stop
them from firing.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.244
I will try, Pilot.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.118
(gasping)

01:28.214 --> 01:32.298
I will never yield.

01:32.385 --> 01:36.424
You must destroy me.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.555
lam not here to hurt you.

01:39.642 --> 01:42.099
lam a Delvian Pa'u,
a priestess.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.142
I can take your pain,
if you allow me.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.063
Why do you help?

01:47.149 --> 01:50.107
Your ship... attack us?

01:50.194 --> 01:51.149
We didn't attack you.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.229
Your smaller ship did.

01:54.323 --> 01:57.781
Captain called it... Talyn.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.742
Talyn did this.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.196
Is that why you targeted us?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.498
Yes.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.245
You must believe me.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.668
We did not send Talyn
to attack you.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.620
Why I trust?

02:11.716 --> 02:14.583
You can scan us.
We're peaceful.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.167
We do not have any weapons.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.093
No weapons?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.169
Nothing.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.889
Yoz!

02:22.977 --> 02:24.683
No weapons!

02:24.770 --> 02:26.761
Destroy their ship.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.346
What are you...?

02:28.441 --> 02:29.556
Lord...

02:29.650 --> 02:32.357
our core is below pulse.

02:32.445 --> 02:33.810
Can only fire once if we...

02:33.904 --> 02:35.610
We have no choice!

02:35.698 --> 02:38.531
D'Argo, lam unfamiliar
with their ship,

02:38.617 --> 02:42.075
but I believe they are
marshaling energy to fire.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.778
I need another cable now!

02:43.873 --> 02:45.079
Coming through!

02:48.627 --> 02:50.288
Rygel, now!

03:27.625 --> 03:29.490
( blended voices):
Screw me, this is impossible.

03:29.585 --> 03:33.749
( blended voices):
What the frell's going on?
That's my body.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.375
l'm Aeryn.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.706
Who are you?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.421
l'm Crichton.

03:45.059 --> 03:50.429
( blended voices):
By the Hynerian gods,
I'm not me.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.643
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.150
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.823
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:02.910 --> 04:06.243
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.319
Help me.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.621
Listen, please.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.538
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:10.626 --> 04:14.960
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.163
I'm doing everything I can.

04:17.258 --> 04:20.341
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.065
Rygel (Crichton):
What are you doing in my body?

04:41.157 --> 04:43.113
Aeryn (Rygel):
I don't know.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.316
But that's my, my, my body.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.447
Crichton (Aeryn):
I know, and this is my body.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.948
Oh, yotz!

04:49.039 --> 04:49.949
Look at it.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.655
Look at what I am.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.163
Aeryn (Rygel):
You? I look like, like... Rygel.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.118
Who are you?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.953
Me? I'm Crichton.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.959
Now, wejust have to...

05:00.050 --> 05:04.293
just think for a second and
try and figure out what
happened to us.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.721
This is not some sort of
sick hallucination.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.766
I want my body back. Pilot!

05:10.853 --> 05:11.638
Pilot!

05:11.729 --> 05:13.185
Rygel, just calm down.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.183
lam not calming down.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.060
Pilot, why aren't you answering?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.391
Pilot!

05:18.486 --> 05:19.191
Aeryn, right?

05:19.278 --> 05:20.643
What do you think?

05:20.738 --> 05:22.478
Of course it's me, John.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.110
Okay, I know this is crazy
but we need to focus.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.281
Look at me.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.700
l have no arms. Look at this.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.324
Aeryn, focus. I need your help.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.030
Now, I don't know what
happened to us.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.501
I don't even know if
this is real.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.122
lfeel something real.
-Shut up, Fluffy!

05:37.213 --> 05:39.625
But I know that we were
attacked, and if we're attacked
again, the Defense...

05:39.715 --> 05:41.251
I think I'm insane!

05:41.342 --> 05:43.207
...half power so we have to
get it fully aligned.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.838
I'm dreaming. Yes, that's it.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.885
l'm asleep and I'm dreaming.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.510
l'll wake up in my royal
bedchamber surrounded
by my concubines

05:50.601 --> 05:52.091
and everything will be fine.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.301
Rygel, listen to me.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.647
I'm not listening to you.
You're a figment.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.847
You're a part of my imagination.

05:58.984 --> 05:59.894
Oh, that's great.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.100
That... was real.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.777
It's the three freaking
Stooges. l'm hitting myself.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.194
Whoever you are...

06:08.285 --> 06:10.150
I want my body back.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.157
We all do, buddy. We all do.

06:12.248 --> 06:16.617
Look, that ship must have shot
us with some kind of
brain-switching weapon.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.827
I don't know, somehow I
got in you, Rygel.

06:19.922 --> 06:24.666
But why? Why would they want us
to switch bodies? Why?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.671
I don't know.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.505
But if this is some kind of
sick experiment, l'm billing
them for the therapy.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.930
Pilot.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.595
Pilot!

06:33.686 --> 06:35.847
D'Argo (Pilot):
Pilot, wake up. Help me.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.021
Pilot (Chiana):
Moya?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.933
Moya, where...? Where are you?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.358
She's right here.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.902
Pilot, look at me.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.322
What...? What happened?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.365
We were hit by some
kind of weapon.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.364
But they haven't shot again.
I do not know why.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.205
Who are you?

06:54.290 --> 06:57.123
It's me. I'm D'Argo.

06:57.835 --> 06:58.585
D'Argo.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.284
Something happened to us.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.370
We've all been switched.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.329
It affected you the worst.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.416
You passed out.
I thought you were dead.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.375
You're... D'Argo.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.091
Then who are you?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.388
Chiana.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.261
Everything's coming apart.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.183
I don't know what I'm
doing here, Pilot.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.556
We're gonna die now, aren't we?

07:18.647 --> 07:19.932
Shut up, Chiana.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.640
It's like I have a million
sounds in my head.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.896
That's Moya.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.272
You're multitasking.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.445
I can't hear anything
specific, Pilot.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.194
All I hear is noise, and
I can't control it.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.656
What the frell!

07:34.747 --> 07:36.112
What was that?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.993
Moya can't hear me and |...

07:39.084 --> 07:40.949
I think she's starting
to panic.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.251
Listen, D'Argo.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.624
You're going to have to control
some of the multitasking.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.579
I can't.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.255
Yes, you can.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.504
l'll... I'll talk you through.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.218
I can't move my legs.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.763
Chiana, take me to D'Argo.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.092
Moya needs my help.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.473
You lied.

08:03.567 --> 08:07.276
Your ship has Defense Screen.

08:07.363 --> 08:12.232
Why have, if not warrior vessel?

08:12.326 --> 08:16.285
We scavenged it from an
abandoned Carrier called
the Zelbinion.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.862
lam telling you the truth.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.244
You... you fired on an
unarmed living creature.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.451
Then why this?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.042
That's not us.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.800
That's Talyn.

08:31.887 --> 08:37.348
30 of my crew dead, and
we the only living.

08:37.434 --> 08:41.393
Talyn is a genetic mutation,
designed to be a gunship.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.345
We have been searching for him.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.852
Moya is not like that ship.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.982
Time count ti|| our weapon
can fire.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.733
Three arns.

08:51.824 --> 08:55.066
By the goddess, we mean
you no harm.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.616
Let me take you aboard Moya.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.365
l'll prove to you that we
have no weapons.

08:58.455 --> 09:05.372
You'll return to your ship
when it is corpse.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.377
Pilot (Chiana):
Thank you, Chiana.

09:12.302 --> 09:16.215
D'Argo, close your eyes.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.718
Now, listen.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.393
Listen through all the sounds
in your head.

09:24.022 --> 09:30.393
Beyond them, there's a high
pitched sound very faint.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.945
I sometimes see it as a...

09:34.032 --> 09:35.988
a sort of color.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.283
A dark red.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.861
Yes. I think | see it.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.321
Good.

09:42.416 --> 09:46.284
Now, push all the other noises
to the side.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.541
Concentrate on the red one.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.249
That's Moya's life-support
functions.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.710
Keep that in your brain
at all times.

09:56.805 --> 10:01.094
Moya's other tasks will
hang off that sound
like it's a rope.

10:01.185 --> 10:03.267
I'll try.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.104
(engine humming)

10:16.658 --> 10:18.159
( popping noise)

10:18.243 --> 10:19.983
(DRD squeaks)

10:23.916 --> 10:26.282
Rygel (Crichton):
Are these really necessary?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.537
Can't you remember who we are?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.244
Crichton (Aeryn):
No, I can't, Einstein.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.001
If these guys attack again I
got to know who I'm talking to.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.379
Pilot, I think I've isolated
our internal Comms.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.131
They should be working now.

10:38.222 --> 10:43.307
Good. Hang the sound on the
rope in your mind like we
talked about.

10:43.393 --> 10:48.262
Now, try to isolate broadcast
frequencies.

10:48.899 --> 10:49.854
Are you okay?

10:49.942 --> 10:51.728
We must contact Zhaan.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.559
Do you think she'll be
all right?

10:53.654 --> 10:57.317
I know she docked on the
Halosian ship before it fired.

10:57.407 --> 11:02.367
l... I don't know what
happened after that.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.536
Any idea why we switched
bodies, Pilot?

11:04.623 --> 11:07.615
No. As soon as minimum
functions return

11:07.709 --> 11:09.085
( Rygel snorting )
I'll help D'Argo

11:09.169 --> 11:12.081
into the memory banks
to run a scan.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.629
But before I switched,
I sensed damage

11:14.716 --> 11:17.924
to the Defense Screen circuitry
in the Neural Cluster.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.549
Nothing serious, but we need to
repair transfer conduits.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.098
Aeryn (Rygel):
Pilot, shouldn't we just worry
about getting our bodies back?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.426
Who cares about fixing
the Defense Screen?

11:27.521 --> 11:30.263
It didn't stop their first
blast from doing this.

11:30.357 --> 11:35.317
When we first got hit the
Defense Screen was only at 62%.

11:35.404 --> 11:39.238
If we get it properly aligned,
it will protect us.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.030
I'm on it.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.574
You coming, Aeryn?

11:54.256 --> 11:56.588
You really know your way
around this maze?

11:56.675 --> 12:01.169
Mm-hmm. There's hundreds of
quadrants, and I had to
learn them all.

12:01.263 --> 12:06.098
This says the Defense Screen
power cell should be...

12:06.184 --> 12:07.594
right up there.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.472
You're going to have to do
all the work, Crichton.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.849
I can't do anything with these.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.103
All right. Well, follow the
circuitry on the schematics

12:15.193 --> 12:19.357
and I'll see if I can isolate
the burned-out conduits.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.033
I accept your offer.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.281
I will survey Moya.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.864
If peaceful, I will
let you free.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.244
Thank you.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.622
Moya is unarmed.
I will prove it to you.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.204
No, you stay.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.757
If they betray, you die.

12:40.844 --> 12:41.754
They won't.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.963
Allow me to be suspicious.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.144
I can't believe you do
this every day.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.188
My whole body aches from
concentrating so hard.

12:55.275 --> 13:00.065
I'm only doing a tiny bit
of what you do and I can
hardly breathe.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.656
Pilot (Chiana):
You'd...

13:03.367 --> 13:06.109
you'd adapt quickly, D'Argo.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.239
What's the matter?

13:09.081 --> 13:10.412
I don't feel so well.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.615
Pilot, I need you here.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.210
Don't pass out on me.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.250
I can't do this without you.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.125
You might... have to.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.298
No. Wait.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.250
There's something, uh...
it's Zhaan.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.381
I'm getting a transmission
from Zhaan.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.339
Put her on external... vocal.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.219
There.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.050
Zhaan:
Pilot, can you hear me?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.521
Why aren't you answering?!

13:33.605 --> 13:34.720
Answer her.

13:34.815 --> 13:35.554
Go on.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.107
Uh, yes, it's me, Zhaan.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.400
Sort of.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.398
Are... are you all right?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.947
Yes. I'm unharmed, but listen.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.446
The attack on Moya was
not unprovoked.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.492
We did nothing.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.161
I know, but Crais did.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.412
He attacked the Halosians
with Talyn.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.915
Talyn? Was Talyn here?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.079
20 arns ago.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.335
Then he disappeared.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.839
That's why they targeted
us, Pilot.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.591
They think that we came here
to destroy them.

14:08.682 --> 14:14.678
Look, if we can prove that Moya
has no weapons, they will
not fire again.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.138
The Halosian commander is
willing to come aboard unarmed,

14:18.233 --> 14:21.020
if we let him search Moya and
prove that we are peaceful.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.942
Hmm...

14:23.030 --> 14:24.986
What do you think?

14:25.073 --> 14:27.530
We don't have much choice.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.196
Tell her it's...

14:30.287 --> 14:31.697
it's agreeable.

14:31.788 --> 14:35.906
Hmm, Zhaan, tell the nawnok
he's clear to come over,

14:36.001 --> 14:38.492
but remind him we're in
no mood for yotz.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.794
One trick, one transgression,
and I kill him.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.166
Pilot, what has happened
to you?

14:42.257 --> 14:43.372
I'm fine.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.300
Just send him over.
(choking noises)

14:46.386 --> 14:49.344
Pilot, what's wrong with you?
Pilot?

14:49.431 --> 14:52.264
Crichton! Aeryn! Pilot's having
some sort of attack!

14:52.350 --> 14:53.180
Get up here!

14:53.268 --> 14:54.883
Get up here now!

14:54.978 --> 14:58.061
Crichton! Somebody, help!

14:59.691 --> 15:00.771
What's happening, Crichton?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.224
I don't know.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.611
ls Pilot rejecting my body?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.189
What happens to my body
if Pilot rejects it?

15:09.284 --> 15:13.698
l'm... I'm much...
much better, Chiana.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.287
We must keep linking...

15:19.377 --> 15:22.915
working to link to Moya's
memory banks...

15:23.006 --> 15:24.337
so we can analyze...

15:24.424 --> 15:26.756
analyze the weapon that
switched us.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.219
Frell that.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.340
I can't do it, Pilot.
I tried, but I can't do it.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.591
Well, you have to.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.264
I don't want to stay like this
you pathetic Luxan.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.559
Crichton, Rygel,
whoever you are.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.809
l'll rip your head off if
you don't shut up.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.108
Wait.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.853
I'm getting a signal.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.151
The Halosian shuttle
is approaching.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.819
We better get down there.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.239
They're expecting me... I mean,
you, to show them around.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.441
Come on!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.828
( breathing irregularly)

16:00.127 --> 16:03.335
Crichton (Aeryn):
Pilot, D'Argo, can you tell me
if this guy's alone?

16:03.421 --> 16:05.753
I've got no frelling
idea, John.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.924
All I know is, he's docking.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.216
Oh, my.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.918
What's the matter?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.969
| feel, um... nothing.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.467
ljust feel, um...

16:15.559 --> 16:17.424
What? Is my body okay, Rygel?

16:17.519 --> 16:20.932
Yes, fine.
Just I think l have to...

16:22.399 --> 16:23.184
Now?

16:23.275 --> 16:25.015
Yes, now. Right now, yes.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.520
You can't go now.
You have to hold it.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.069
I don't know how to hold it,
Chiana. I don't know this body.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.647
Then go. Just go.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.606
What? Here?

16:33.702 --> 16:35.863
Over there, now. Go.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.364
"There, now."

16:39.082 --> 16:40.492
Hmm.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.832
D'Argo, is this guy here yet?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.875
He should be there any microt.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.328
Uh, Crichton.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.208
What?

16:47.299 --> 16:48.960
Can you show me how to do this?

16:49.926 --> 16:52.542
Oh, my god.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.507
Unzip.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.215
Right.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.516
Pull it out.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.305
(grunts)

17:01.396 --> 17:03.603
Point it like a gun.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.480
and shoot.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.774
Aiming it the right way?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.726
Yes, that's fine.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.193
He's here.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.253
lam Tak.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.208
We figured.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.385
D'Argo, search him.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.175
D'Argo.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.642
Oh, sorry.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.138
Not necessary.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.187
I am unarmed.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.685
Face the wall and spread your
feathers, big guy.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.607
(Tak groans)

17:54.366 --> 17:57.233
Where is Crichton?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.864
Told he show me Moya.

17:59.955 --> 18:05.575
By the Hynerian gods,
that is good!

18:05.669 --> 18:07.205
Yes, so I'll just um,

18:07.295 --> 18:09.331
put this thing away and...

18:09.422 --> 18:10.207
(shrieks)

18:10.298 --> 18:11.674
Yotz!

18:12.467 --> 18:13.627
( groans )

18:13.718 --> 18:16.551
Put it away and be
careful, Sparky.

18:19.724 --> 18:23.091
D'Argo (Pilot):
Can't believe it.
It's getting easier, Pilot.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.640
How are you feeling?

18:26.731 --> 18:30.315
If I stay calm, I'm fine.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.565
But I still sense Chiana's
body wants me gone.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.407
I never thought I'd be
separated from Moya again.

18:41.121 --> 18:45.205
It's as though all my
senses have...

18:45.292 --> 18:47.328
have vanished.

18:48.253 --> 18:54.169
I can't see, or hear, or
feel like I did.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.045
I'm beginning to understand.

18:56.136 --> 18:59.048
The glimpses | get of what
you experience, Pilot,

18:59.139 --> 19:01.425
they make my own life feel
insignificant.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.925
That's not true, D'Argo.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.763
It is. l have memories of
my son, of a wife,

19:08.857 --> 19:12.520
but you have seen the galaxies
and the birth of stars.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.520
But I have no...

19:16.614 --> 19:19.230
no memories of love.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.196
Of friendship.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.825
You have the remarkable
memories, D'Argo.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.425
(Delvian chanting)

19:41.389 --> 19:45.302
(Delvian chanting)

19:47.270 --> 19:50.307
lbeHeve”.

19:50.398 --> 19:54.107
I believe that your Moya
peaceful.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.276
So will Tak when he
searches it.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.603
Perhaps.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.528
Look.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.402
Show you something.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.194
I am Captain Crais.

20:06.289 --> 20:10.282
We travel in peace and we
wish you safe passage.

20:12.379 --> 20:16.588
Halos-1, my ship's defense
mechanisms have been activated.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.461
We sense your weapons have
charged. Stand down.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.508
I repeat, we travel in peace.

20:23.640 --> 20:28.259
Talyn, prime guns for
retaliation.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.184
Fire now!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.060
You fired first.

20:32.148 --> 20:36.141
Talyn just defend itself.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.148
So Crais was honorable.
He's not using Talyn for battle.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.151
He could destroy us.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.607
But chose not.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.737
Why did you fire on Talyn?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.660
Our Code.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.035
Tak desires to evolve.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.710
He must register hostile kills.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.208
As many as possible.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.217
As you can see, no weapons
anywhere.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.260
If you ask me, it's frelling
ludicrous.

21:05.348 --> 21:10.138
In my royal fleet, every ship
had a hundred cannon.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.264
Crichton, stop talking.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.313
Just making conversation, Rygel.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.517
so our guests can see that we
are friendly creatures.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.944
Creatures with no weapons.

21:22.031 --> 21:28.778
That way, when he's finished
searching, you can change me
back, right?

21:28.872 --> 21:33.366
Everything will be dealt with.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.878
Good, good.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.169
One microt.

21:38.256 --> 21:42.249
Aeryn, I think I'm making some
progress with this idiot,

21:42.343 --> 21:46.757
so why don't you leave us alone
and I'll show him the
ship myself?

21:46.848 --> 21:49.260
What are you up to, Rygel?

21:49.350 --> 21:50.931
Nothing.

21:51.019 --> 21:55.433
And my own body shouldn't be
suspicious of me, so rack off!

21:56.274 --> 21:57.480
Pff!

21:59.068 --> 22:00.274
Now...

22:03.198 --> 22:05.860
Okay, I've done all
I can do here.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.986
I've changed all the
burned-out conduits.

22:08.077 --> 22:13.162
Can you run an integrity check
and see if this damn Defense
Screen will run to 100% now?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.910
I'll try, John.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.366
Okay.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.519
(zipper opening)

22:46.282 --> 22:47.863
(exhales sharply)

22:48.618 --> 22:51.155
( chuckles )

22:53.957 --> 22:55.288
Oh...

22:59.379 --> 23:01.370
(chuckling)

23:10.223 --> 23:12.339
Oh...

23:12.433 --> 23:14.048
Mama!

23:14.143 --> 23:16.179
Aeryn (Rygel):
Crichton?

23:16.271 --> 23:17.135
What are you doing?

23:17.230 --> 23:18.891
Oh...

23:18.982 --> 23:21.644
Oh come on, man, I'm...

23:21.734 --> 23:23.270
They're here.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.897
They're right here.

23:24.988 --> 23:28.105
They've been here for a couple
of arns, and ljust had to...

23:28.199 --> 23:31.316
Aeryn (Rygel):
You are mentally damaged.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.652
No, I'm a guy.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.079
A guy. Guys dream about
this sort of thing.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.542
Aeryn (Rygel):
I'll tell you one thing,
Crichton.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.834
If I find you've been dreaming
anything else to my body,

23:41.921 --> 23:45.038
I'll break your legs,
even if they are mine.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.215
What are you guys doing
here anyway?

23:47.302 --> 23:49.167
I've just repatched the
Defense Screen and Command.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.718
I need you to have a
look at it.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.171
Unless you need some more...
private time.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.224
Oh, shut up, Chiana. God knows
what you've been doing
to that body.

23:56.311 --> 23:58.393
Aeryn (Rygel):
Look, you two can fight
it out later.

23:58.479 --> 24:02.097
Rygel's about to bring the
Halosians through the quadrant
below this one.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.354
I came to tell you to clear
out. So clear.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.855
Okay.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.904
Rygel (Crichton):
Haven't you searched enough
of these cells?

24:10.992 --> 24:13.608
Think about it. If we had a
weapon, we'd have already
fired it.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.364
Yes.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.744
I believe you have no weapons.

24:19.834 --> 24:23.668
Well, there you are.
That's good. We can be friends.
Come on.

24:23.755 --> 24:27.213
Yes, let's go. Don't stand
there like a wounded trelkez.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.337
We'll have our feast,
worthy of a Royal Dominar.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.043
No, l...

24:32.138 --> 24:35.096
l... lfeel unwell.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.801
No, no, no, we're well-stocked
for the first time in
a million cycles.

24:38.895 --> 24:43.264
We have fellip shanks,
Hynerian marjools...

24:43.358 --> 24:46.441
lthink |-|...

24:46.527 --> 24:49.143
(vomits )

24:57.205 --> 25:00.322
Right. Go on, go on.
Let it all out.

25:02.752 --> 25:05.243
Excuse.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.671
No, no, no, that's all right.
We do that sort of thing
all the time here on Moya.

25:08.758 --> 25:11.340
I just peed in the
Maintenance Bay.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.218
And, um...

25:16.766 --> 25:20.133
now that we're friends and you
know that we have no weapons,

25:20.228 --> 25:23.686
you think you can switch me
back to my own body right away?

25:23.773 --> 25:26.560
When I get to my ship...

25:26.651 --> 25:29.563
I'll see what I can do.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.315
Well, hurry it up.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.819
ldon't think I can stand
this gangly hunk of flesh
much longer.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.240
Don't worry.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.534
Won't be much longer.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.803
What's going on, D'Argo?

25:57.890 --> 26:01.348
Moya's scared. Something
foreign to her is attacking
her internal circuitry.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.676
Any idea what?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.476
No. I can't see anything yet.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.974
It must have been Tak.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.930
He must have brought
something on board.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.357
No way. Chiana searched him.
She didn't find anything.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.436
Well, she must have missed it.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.272
D'Argo, you're going to have
to give us a better idea
of where to look.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.947
Rygel took Tak everywhere.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.023
I don't know where.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.734
I've got nothing here, John.

26:19.829 --> 26:23.196
All right, we'd better find
Spanky. I'm sure he knows
something.

26:25.418 --> 26:29.331
Your people talk of
switching back.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.878
What means?

26:30.965 --> 26:32.080
I have no idea.

26:32.175 --> 26:35.793
You lie, but no care.

26:35.887 --> 26:38.173
l destroy Moya.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.800
Are weapons ready?

26:39.891 --> 26:41.256
Yes, Lord.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.510
Good.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.345
You know this is wrong.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.477
Can do nothing.
Our Code forbids me...

26:50.568 --> 26:52.058
Frell your code!

26:52.153 --> 26:53.188
Stop him.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.112
Yoz:
I'm fascinated by your Code.

26:56.199 --> 27:00.659
Those on Moya not your race,
yet you worry.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.235
Of course.

27:02.330 --> 27:06.744
We worry about nothing,
except ourselves.

27:06.834 --> 27:11.669
If that is true, Yoz, if you're
just concerned with your own
evolve, I can help you.

27:11.756 --> 27:15.920
Tak failed when he fired at
Moya and he failed to
destroy her, right?

27:16.010 --> 27:17.295
Yes.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.628
If a Lord fails, can you replace
him? Does your code allow this?

27:20.723 --> 27:21.838
Yes.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.174
Then you should replace him.

27:24.268 --> 27:24.893
Me?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.092
Why not?

27:26.187 --> 27:27.973
Wouldn't you evolve quicker
if you did?

27:28.064 --> 27:30.601
Yes, ifl...

27:30.691 --> 27:33.103
prove his fail...

27:33.194 --> 27:37.278
I will be your proof.
I will tell anyone you want
that he failed and you had to take over from him.

27:37.365 --> 27:40.857
Just... just let Moya go.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.659
No, Tak not fail.

27:43.746 --> 27:48.410
If he not destroy Moya now,
we talk again.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.452
But then it would be too late.

28:06.561 --> 28:07.971
(bubbling)

28:08.062 --> 28:09.518
( electrical crackling )

28:27.290 --> 28:29.201
You know what we have
to do, Rygel?

28:29.292 --> 28:30.702
Get the frell out of here.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.000
Is that your answer for
everything, Chiana?

28:33.087 --> 28:34.588
Just run?

28:34.672 --> 28:36.378
That's what you do, Rygel.

28:36.465 --> 28:41.380
Yes, normally. And I'd do it
in a microt except I want
my body back.

28:43.598 --> 28:46.305
Now why would you want
to do that?

28:46.392 --> 28:49.179
This body's much better.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.931
You think?

28:51.022 --> 28:53.388
I know.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.940
On Moya you don't have much
competition, but...

28:57.028 --> 29:00.065
this is as good as it
gets, Sluggy.

29:00.156 --> 29:04.399
But this body is so white.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.530
And it only lasts only another
40 pathetic cycles.

29:07.622 --> 29:08.828
Mine will last for...

29:08.915 --> 29:10.530
(gasps )

29:13.252 --> 29:15.288
What are you doing, Chiana?

29:16.464 --> 29:20.924
I want someone to go with me.

29:21.886 --> 29:25.845
It gets lonely out there.

29:25.932 --> 29:30.175
Normally you have to rub
my eyebrows to make me
feel like this.

29:30.269 --> 29:35.013
I'll rub you anywhere you like
in the Transport Pod.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.098
Don't you want your body back?

29:37.193 --> 29:40.356
I'd rather be alive in this
body than dead in my own.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.861
Let's get out of here.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.031
Oh, no! No!

29:45.117 --> 29:47.369
No, I can't go with you, girl.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.244
What are you doing, Rygel?

29:51.332 --> 29:53.163
Why do you want to stay?

29:53.250 --> 29:57.334
Because I need my body.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.628
Not this body.

29:59.715 --> 30:04.209
Only a Royal Hynerian can
reclaim my throne.

30:04.303 --> 30:10.139
And the hope of executing the
cousin who betrayed me...

30:10.226 --> 30:13.514
is the only reason I live.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.428
( footsteps )

30:15.523 --> 30:18.310
Little guy!
Been looking for you.

30:18.401 --> 30:22.235
Listen, D'Argo says whatever's
attacking Moya is in the
Neural Cluster.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.154
That means Tak must have done
something when you were showing
him through.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.857
He didn't do anything.

30:27.952 --> 30:31.115
I showed him around the ship
then he got sick and left.

30:31.205 --> 30:34.197
He got sick? What do you mean?

30:34.291 --> 30:36.077
He threw up.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.544
Disgusting creature.

30:37.628 --> 30:38.458
Show us.

30:38.546 --> 30:39.410
What?

30:39.505 --> 30:41.166
Show me the pavement pizza.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.588
You want to see vomit?

30:42.675 --> 30:45.007
Nobody wants to see vomit.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.549
Rygel (Crichton):
Over there.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.595
He vomited over there.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.302
Yotz!

30:52.393 --> 30:53.508
Creeping vomit.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.560
How the... how the biznak
did it do that?

30:56.647 --> 31:01.482
I don't know, but I'm pretty
sure the Defense Screen
power cell is up here.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.275
Chiana (D'Argo):
Be careful, Crichton.

31:04.864 --> 31:08.573
He must have barfed up some
kind of acid to burn out
these conduits.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.610
Oh, crap, the acid's
still moving.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.370
Chiana (D'Argo):
What's going on?

31:15.458 --> 31:18.291
Crichton (Aeryn):
Maybe we could leapfrog the
power to this cell.

31:20.254 --> 31:21.755
Chiana, go back to the den.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.330
Re-link the cables we patched
in before into that cell there.

31:24.425 --> 31:26.336
Where exactly does
that lead to?

31:26.427 --> 31:27.758
I don't know. Ask Pilot.

31:27.845 --> 31:29.210
Do you know what you're doing,
Crichton?

31:29.305 --> 31:32.263
No, I have no idea.
I'm making it up as | go.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.768
Move!

31:34.852 --> 31:39.892
Right, and even if we can frag
leap the Defense Screen to
that cell over there,

31:39.982 --> 31:42.314
how the frell are we going
to stop the vomit?

31:42.401 --> 31:43.777
We have to try and contain it.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.102
Alkaline solution neutralizes
acid, right?

31:46.197 --> 31:48.279
So do we have anything like
that on board Moya?

31:48.365 --> 31:51.357
Zhaan.
I'll wager she has some
in her apothecary.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.239
All right, find it. But move.
We don't have much time.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.615
(groaning)

31:55.706 --> 31:58.413
The frelling Halosian ship
has targeted us again.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.287
We need to re-Iink the
Defense Screen.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.584
To where?

32:02.671 --> 32:06.414
I was hoping you were able
to tell me that, Pilot.

32:06.509 --> 32:11.128
I had to go up two tiers in the
waste lift to find another
way in here.

32:11.222 --> 32:12.553
Two tiers.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.130
Have you figured out
what to do?

32:14.225 --> 32:16.216
I think so. Rygel's going to
dump that stuff in there

32:16.310 --> 32:18.266
while I re-patch the Defense
Screen power supply.

32:18.354 --> 32:20.345
Is this going to work?
-I have no idea.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.225
I'm going to have to shut down
the Defence Screen when
I switch over.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.773
But the Halosians will be able
to attack us.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.602
Only for a couple of seconds.
We don't have any choice, Rygel.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.938
If we don't do this, they're
going to attack us as soon as
the Defense Screen burns out.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.069
Are you ready to start dumping
that crap in there?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.195
On your call.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.323
Okay, I hope this works.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.200
D'Argo, shut down the
Defense Screen.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.667
Shutting down now.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.580
Go.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.292
Defense Screen down.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.093
Destroy them.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.386
Stop!

32:55.182 --> 32:56.137
They're unarmed!

32:56.225 --> 32:57.840
Okay, D'Argo, I'm on.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.095
Turn on the Defense Screen.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.392
Powering now.

33:02.690 --> 33:03.896
I've done it.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.269
I think I've re-patched the
Defense Screen.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.200
Oh, no.

33:22.293 --> 33:23.829
I'm Aeryn.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.168
(gasps )

33:26.255 --> 33:27.119
Who's Crichton?

33:27.214 --> 33:28.670
( imitating buzzer)

33:28.757 --> 33:30.372
lam.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.338
Yotz!

33:37.683 --> 33:42.928
Look, except for me being
stuck in this disgusting,
smelly, ugly...

33:43.022 --> 33:45.104
My body is Royal, not smelly.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.271
Rygel!

33:46.358 --> 33:49.225
Except for me being in here,
things are looking up.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.810
How do you figure that,
Crichton?

33:50.905 --> 33:52.816
We've switched.

33:52.907 --> 33:57.776
So, if we can switch to here,
Aeyrn, then we can switch back
to our original bodies, right?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.486
Chiana (Pilot):
Crichton? Aeryn? Somebody?

34:00.581 --> 34:02.242
It's Chiana...

34:02.333 --> 34:03.368
I'm in Pilot.

34:03.459 --> 34:06.292
Pilot's in D'Argo's body,
but he's not moving.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.834
We can't get him to wake up.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.332
Get down here, John.

34:09.423 --> 34:11.334
I think Pilot is dying.

34:13.219 --> 34:17.679
Defense Screen still work.

34:17.765 --> 34:20.848
But I not fail.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.551
I ram Moya.

34:24.355 --> 34:25.515
Don't! Don't!

34:25.606 --> 34:28.268
They're peaceful. Please.

34:28.359 --> 34:30.099
They have not hurt you.

34:30.194 --> 34:36.815
Yoz, you cannot interfere with
your Lord's plan unless
he fails, right?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.942
Well, he has failed.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.035
Stop him.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.621
Stop him.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.699
Yes!

34:48.587 --> 34:50.123
(hissing)

34:50.214 --> 34:51.750
(growling)

34:54.176 --> 34:56.087
(crunching sounds)

35:07.147 --> 35:09.183
Tak was fool.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.857
I will evolve.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.653
I can't get through to
the Halosians.

35:20.744 --> 35:21.824
Can't do anything.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.868
Do not panic.
Think of the rope!

35:23.956 --> 35:26.288
Frell the rope!
I can't do this, D'Argo.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.369
Do it, you pathetic tralk!

35:31.463 --> 35:35.957
All right. Calm down,
everybody. Just calm down.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.463
D'Argo, before the last blast
is there anything you remember?

35:38.554 --> 35:41.170
I felt the power of the blast
before I shifted out of Pilot.

35:41.265 --> 35:46.100
I think the beam was trying to
destroy Moya, not make
us switch bodies.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.346
Then why didn't it destroy us?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.303
I do not know.

35:49.398 --> 35:52.140
The Defense Screen deflected
most of the energy, but
some got through.

35:52.234 --> 35:54.020
Oh, oh, oh, Chiana.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.568
Was the screen at full power
when their beam hit?

35:56.655 --> 36:01.570
No, the sensors say Screen
power was at, uh... 62%.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.696
Okay. Okay.

36:03.787 --> 36:08.121
Maybe it's the interaction of
their weapon and our screen
that makes us switch bodies.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.290
Part of the beam gets through.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.083
That's the part that
affects us.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.911
But how do we get back,
Crichton?

36:14.006 --> 36:15.746
Pilot is barely breathing.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.706
All right, let's try this.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.087
We power the screen to 62%,

36:20.179 --> 36:23.797
get in the same position we
were in the first time
the beam hit.

36:23.891 --> 36:27.429
Then we moon the Halosians, and
hope they'll shoot us again.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.055
Are you sure about this, John?

36:29.146 --> 36:29.931
Nope.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.307
Another blast could kill us.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.604
Yep.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.977
The Halosian ship is
heading towards us.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.104
Are its weapons targeted?

36:36.195 --> 36:38.231
No, but it's moving fast.

36:38.322 --> 36:40.278
I think it wants to ram us.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.982
Moya's attempting to
initiate Starburst.

36:43.077 --> 36:44.317
Don't let her, Chiana.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.447
If she does, we'll never
get our bodies back.

36:46.538 --> 36:50.122
Keep Moya calm and initiate
evasive maneuvers.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.666
Help, Aeryn?

36:54.088 --> 36:55.077
How?

36:55.172 --> 36:56.582
ldon't know how to do anything.

36:56.673 --> 37:00.165
I will help you. Go, John.
Get back to Command.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.969
I will wake Pilot and put him
in the same position he was in
during the first attack.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.671
Right.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.131
You don't have to do this!

37:07.226 --> 37:08.306
You don't have to die!

37:08.394 --> 37:10.009
Will not.

37:10.104 --> 37:15.599
As soon as on target, I escape
in your Transport Pod.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.855
Such a warrior's code, killing
defenseless beings.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.699
(chanting Delvian prayer)

37:39.216 --> 37:41.423
Now time for...

37:47.224 --> 37:49.715
Chiana, is the Halosian ship
still heading towards us?

37:49.810 --> 37:56.181
Yes. I'm attempting evasive
maneuvers, but Moya still
wants to Starburst.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.727
Crichton (Rygel):
Watch out Chiana,
we're going to hit.

38:01.822 --> 38:03.358
I can't stop it!

38:04.950 --> 38:06.406
Hold on!

38:14.334 --> 38:16.290
(panting)

38:16.920 --> 38:18.706
That was freaking close!

38:18.797 --> 38:19.752
You did it, Chiana.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.330
ldidn't do anything.

38:21.425 --> 38:22.540
Moya turned us.

38:22.634 --> 38:26.377
Wait. I'm-I'm picking up a
transmission from Zhaan.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.258
Can you put it on the clamshell?

38:28.348 --> 38:30.339
I'll try.

38:30.434 --> 38:33.847
I finally have control of
the ship. ls everyone
on Moya all right?

38:33.937 --> 38:37.179
Well, that depends on your
definition of "all right."
I, personally, would say no...

38:37.274 --> 38:38.639
Rygel, shut up.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.439
What's the matter?

38:40.527 --> 38:42.518
It would take too long
to explain.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.150
Look, Zhaan, we need you
to do us a favor.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.231
We need you to shoot us again.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.157
Can you do that?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.233
What is this madness?

38:50.329 --> 38:52.194
It's not madness.

38:52.289 --> 38:55.281
Rygel, why do you have a picture
of Crichton on your chest?

38:55.375 --> 38:56.831
Let me speak to him.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.580
But I'm...

39:00.380 --> 39:01.881
Crichton.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.250
She wants me?

39:03.342 --> 39:04.331
Yeah.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.166
Zhaan wants to hear it
from you.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.172
She won't listen to Rygel.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.252
I told you.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.339
You all say I'm paranoid,
but it's true.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.139
No one ever frelling
listens to me.

39:13.227 --> 39:14.307
Can it, furball!

39:14.394 --> 39:16.305
Great! Now, I'm getting yotz
from my own body.

39:16.396 --> 39:19.479
By the goddess, what is this
madness that has overtaken
all of you?

39:19.566 --> 39:22.899
We'll explain later.
Just shoot us, Zhaan.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.898
Full power. And don't worry,
we'll have the screen up.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.695
Are you sure about this,
Crichton?

39:27.783 --> 39:31.241
Shoot the damn gun, you blue
assed bitch. I'm sick of
all of this.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.444
Yes, I'm sure, Zhaan.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.700
Just shoot us, full power.

39:37.417 --> 39:41.660
Trust me.
Everything will be all right.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.454
If you say so, John.

39:44.550 --> 39:49.214
Disgusting. "If you say so,
John. Trust me. It'll be
all right."

39:49.304 --> 39:50.760
And she believes it.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.259
Well, yotz, if I said that,
you'd all vomit.

39:53.350 --> 39:56.183
Chiana, is the Defense Screen
at 62%?

39:56.270 --> 39:58.010
Setting it now.

39:58.105 --> 40:01.347
Are the three of you in your
exact positions you were in
when the first beam hit?

40:01.441 --> 40:03.102
We're working on it.

40:03.193 --> 40:06.936
Wake up, Pilot. Please.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.112
You've got to be just
where I was.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.281
(grunting)

40:13.370 --> 40:15.782
I cannot move you by myself.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.408
(grunting)

40:18.375 --> 40:19.831
I'm calibrating the weapons,
John.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.579
Firing in ten microts.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.578
(grunting)

40:24.673 --> 40:26.664
Right there, Rygel.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.713
Okay.

40:27.801 --> 40:28.756
Okay.

40:28.844 --> 40:30.254
Are you both in the
same position?

40:30.345 --> 40:31.676
Yes, John.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.014
Rygel (Aeryn):
Are you sure?

40:33.098 --> 40:34.258
Maybe you were here.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.384
Maybe you were there.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.306
Rygel...

40:37.394 --> 40:39.055
Yotz.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.636
D'Argo, how you doing?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.438
Tell Zhaan to hang on a microt.

40:43.525 --> 40:44.480
Pilot!

40:44.568 --> 40:45.853
(grunting)

40:45.944 --> 40:48.230
What? What happened?

40:48.322 --> 40:50.278
I can't contact Zhaan.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.354
She's not responding.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.283
You have to get up, Pilot. Now!

40:54.369 --> 40:55.825
Stand!

40:55.912 --> 40:58.244
Stand, you son of a Hezmot!

40:58.332 --> 40:59.822
(grunting)

41:01.960 --> 41:03.496
Hang on, Zhaan!

41:03.587 --> 41:06.044
Do not fire yet!

41:07.257 --> 41:08.633
Firing now.

41:09.718 --> 41:10.628
(whirring )

41:14.431 --> 41:15.716
( exploding )

41:27.235 --> 41:28.395
(gasps )

41:28.487 --> 41:30.523
( Rygel chuckling )

41:30.614 --> 41:32.354
Crichton:
Yotz...

41:32.449 --> 41:37.785
I'll just crawl back to my
Royal bedchamber and...

41:39.039 --> 41:41.405
joke, Aeryn. I'm back.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.825
( chuckling )
You bastard.

41:45.629 --> 41:47.335
(laughing)

41:49.508 --> 41:50.372
Hey!

41:50.467 --> 41:51.877
You guys okay up there?

41:51.968 --> 41:53.378
(Chiana laughing)

41:53.470 --> 41:56.678
Yes, Crichton. We're all back.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.172
(laughing)

42:00.268 --> 42:01.553
It's me.

42:01.645 --> 42:03.226
(laughing continues)

42:03.313 --> 42:04.177
It's me!

42:04.272 --> 42:05.102
Yes!

42:05.190 --> 42:06.521
We did it.

42:06.608 --> 42:07.563
Mmm.

42:07.651 --> 42:09.016
(laughing)

42:09.111 --> 42:11.067
(both laughing)

42:13.365 --> 42:15.321
Oh, yes, I'm back, too.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.024
Thanks for asking.

42:17.119 --> 42:19.326
Back to being me.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.825
Back to being ignored.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.825
How large has Talyn grown?

42:26.920 --> 42:30.959
He's not as big as Moya yet,
Pilot, but he's fierce.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.212
When he decided to attack
he easily destroyed the
Halosian ship.

42:34.302 --> 42:38.671
Can we take heart that Crais
didn't initiate the attack?

42:38.765 --> 42:41.928
Perhaps he won't use Talyn
as a weapon.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.303
Perhaps.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.351
Perhaps he'll surprise us all.

42:45.439 --> 42:48.431
I'm glad you're back, Zhaan,
but I must go.

42:48.525 --> 42:53.360
I must share with Moya all the
experiences I've had when
separated from her.

42:53.447 --> 42:55.108
She wants to know everything.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.109
(chuckling)

42:57.200 --> 43:02.740
Uh... Zhaan, will your hand
ever get better?

43:02.831 --> 43:06.119
I've reinitiated the internal
flow of nutrients, Rygel.

43:06.209 --> 43:10.999
But there's a danger that not
all function will return,
so I must heal it slowly.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.216
What?

43:21.308 --> 43:22.844
( chuckles )

43:22.934 --> 43:25.311
Why are you looking at
me like that?

43:25.395 --> 43:27.101
Oh, it's nothing.

43:27.189 --> 43:30.647
It's just that my tenkas
are sore and they've never
felt like that before.

43:30.734 --> 43:33.271
So, I was wondering...

43:33.361 --> 43:35.568
what... what you were
doing with them.

43:35.655 --> 43:36.940
Nothing.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.522
Hey, have you been speaking
to Crichton?

43:38.617 --> 43:40.073
No...

43:40.160 --> 43:41.445
but, um...

43:42.662 --> 43:44.448
I, uh...

43:44.539 --> 43:47.576
did want to say to
you that I...

43:47.667 --> 43:49.828
I really...

43:50.504 --> 43:52.244
really enjoyed...

43:52.339 --> 43:54.375
being inside your body.

43:55.342 --> 43:58.300
Oh, ah, um... no.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.546
What...

43:59.638 --> 44:00.878
What I meant...

44:00.972 --> 44:02.803
by that... is that I...

44:02.891 --> 44:05.132
I know what you mean.

44:07.854 --> 44:09.560
I really like your body.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.934
You like my body?

44:32.504 --> 44:34.210
Well...

44:34.297 --> 44:37.209
they certainly seem to be
readjusting well.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.040
Uh-huh.

44:39.135 --> 44:43.344
Well, they say you have to walk
a mile in someone's shoes
to understand them.

44:43.431 --> 44:47.640
Well, I certainly know what you
were doing when you were in
my shoes, Crichton.

44:47.727 --> 44:48.887
Give me a break.

44:48.979 --> 44:50.515
(laughing)

44:51.147 --> 44:52.432
It's okay.

44:52.524 --> 44:53.889
It's okay, you know?

44:53.984 --> 44:55.849
You were in my shoes.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.559
l was in your pants.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.360
Excuse me?

45:05.245 --> 45:06.451
You...
