A plague is sweeping
through Springfield.

A blue bonnet plague.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.119

01:30.340 --> 01:32.708
The giant chocolate

Hollow?

01:34.077 --> 01:35.311
We paid for solid!

01:35.345 --> 01:37.580
Chief, the company's named
Bunny Hollow.

01:37.614 --> 01:39.382
I thought that was
where they lived.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.751
Look at those delightful
children, Smithers.

01:41.785 --> 01:44.754
All those healthy organs,
ripe for the harvesting.

01:48.625 --> 01:49.926
Not here, sir.

01:49.960 --> 01:50.927
Not now.

Mm. Hmm.

02:40.510 --> 02:43.079
Who could've shoved eggs
up our brass?

02:46.249 --> 02:49.919
His amusement is tantamount
to culpability!

02:51.388 --> 02:52.488
Easy, easy.

02:52.522 --> 02:53.389
Let's not jump to conclus...

02:53.390 --> 02:55.525
Too late.
Already jumped.

Egg don't belong

03:07.204 --> 03:09.005
why aren't these
people at work?

03:14.011 --> 03:15.111
Good Lord.

03:15.145 --> 03:17.714
Look at all these
comical booklets.

03:17.748 --> 03:19.182
Yes, yes.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.317
Just don't exhale your
death breath directly on them.

03:21.352 --> 03:22.552
Thank you.

03:22.586 --> 03:24.654
You know, I used to
collect these

03:24.688 --> 03:26.289
bestapled fables.

03:30.661 --> 03:31.895
What are you reading?

03:31.929 --> 03:33.429
The adventures
of <i>The Good Shepherd</i>

03:33.464 --> 03:35.665
and his sidekick,
The Fleecy Kid.

03:35.699 --> 03:37.700
Bah!
That's his battle cry.

03:37.735 --> 03:38.768
Baa!

03:38.802 --> 03:41.137
The sound which
terrifies sheep rustlers

03:41.171 --> 03:43.072
the length and breadth
of Michigan's

03:43.107 --> 03:44.574
untamed upper peninsula.

03:44.608 --> 03:47.744
You should be out
in the fresh air, kicking dogs.

03:47.778 --> 03:50.146
I'm gonna buy
this publishing company

03:50.180 --> 03:52.081
and burn it to the ground.

03:52.116 --> 03:54.584
Why did you
have to lock us in?

03:54.618 --> 03:56.152
Teach my son
a lesson!

03:59.990 --> 04:01.925
How much for your
entire collection?

04:01.959 --> 04:05.428
Um, the speed of light,
expressed in dollars.

04:05.462 --> 04:08.064
Just give him
Faraday's Constant.

04:15.773 --> 04:17.607
Nice going, Bart.

04:17.641 --> 04:19.676
You've ruined
Halloween, Thanksgiving,

04:19.709 --> 04:20.877
Christmas and Easter.

04:20.911 --> 04:23.079
The legendary
grand slam.

04:23.113 --> 04:25.181
You guys,
I swear I didn't do it.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.961
Oh, I don't like the sound
of that funeral march.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.865
Okay, I'll pay
for your damn band candy!

04:42.900 --> 04:44.968
What was it, $1,700?

04:45.002 --> 04:46.169
Forget the candy!

04:46.203 --> 04:48.137
We're here to turn this...

04:48.172 --> 04:50.640
into this.

04:50.674 --> 04:53.376
Now do me wearing a sombrero.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.815
Now have me
sleeping under a cactus.

04:59.850 --> 05:00.850
D'oh!

05:00.884 --> 05:02.118
Hand over your son,

05:02.152 --> 05:04.787
so we can administer
"Band Justice."

05:08.092 --> 05:09.492
I know this looks bad.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.527
And I admit, I would
totally lie in a second

05:11.562 --> 05:13.696
to Lisa or
Mom or Dad,

05:13.731 --> 05:15.732
but I would never
lie to Maggie.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.301
I did not do
that prank.

05:23.273 --> 05:26.376
Wow, he passed
the Maggie test.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.778
And remember how
Maggie solved Cookiegate?

05:28.812 --> 05:30.747
All too well.

05:30.781 --> 05:35.551
To prove my brother's innocence,
I demand a youth court.

05:36.787 --> 05:37.820
That's right!

05:37.855 --> 05:39.856
Bart must not be judged
by these kids,

05:39.890 --> 05:42.291
but by a jury, of kids.

05:42.326 --> 05:43.559
Mostly these kids.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.094
There's only so many kids.

05:46.463 --> 05:48.798
I'm afraid once a youth court
has been demanded,

05:48.832 --> 05:52.101
we are legally obligated
to shut down mob rule,

05:52.136 --> 05:54.604
as decided in the case of
<i>Rubber v. Glue</i>

05:54.638 --> 05:57.774
and reaffirmed by
<i>I Know You Are v. What Am I.</i>

05:57.808 --> 06:00.376
Son, if there's one thing
I've learned

06:00.411 --> 06:05.048
as a defendant and a juror,
it's stay out of the courtroom.

06:05.082 --> 06:06.916
It's so frickin' boring.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.917
Run, boy!

06:07.951 --> 06:09.719
I'll create a
distraction.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.553
Anyone can conduct Sousa.

06:45.637 --> 06:46.804
Good news, bad news:

06:46.838 --> 06:48.439
we're allowed to
select the judge,

06:48.473 --> 06:51.742
but it's impossible to find
one who doesn't hate you.

06:51.776 --> 06:54.345
I know someone who would
make a great judge.

06:54.379 --> 06:56.246
Would you kids
believe your Grampa

06:56.281 --> 06:58.349
once argued
in front of the Supreme Court?

06:58.383 --> 06:59.450
No.
Sorry.

06:59.484 --> 07:00.484
Not a chance.

07:00.518 --> 07:01.985
I mean, it's true.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.488
It was back in 1998.

07:04.522 --> 07:07.191
I say individual rights.

07:07.225 --> 07:09.026
I say the common good.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.862
Gentlemen,
our system balances both.

07:11.896 --> 07:14.031
Oh, yeah, and how
would you know?

07:14.065 --> 07:16.100
Attorney General
Janet Reno?

07:16.134 --> 07:17.201
That's right.

07:17.235 --> 07:19.470
And that better not
be your gum on the ground.

07:19.504 --> 07:21.638
Uh, it's not, but
I'll take care of it.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.542
Stop doing that.

07:27.112 --> 07:30.514
This is better than being a real
attorney or a real general.

07:30.548 --> 07:33.617
The attorney general and
I have been playing chess

07:33.651 --> 07:35.386
through the mail
ever since.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.554
I find that
a little hard to believe.

07:37.589 --> 07:39.857
Yeah, why would you
play chess through the mail

07:39.891 --> 07:41.558
when you can play chess
through the Internet?

07:41.593 --> 07:43.660
Or preferably,
not play chess at all?

07:43.695 --> 07:45.429
See here, sass mouth,

07:45.463 --> 07:47.865
you're not too big
for me to tan your hide.

07:47.899 --> 07:50.401
It's not a threat
if I don't know what it means.

07:50.435 --> 07:52.169
I'll fix your wagon!

07:52.203 --> 07:53.437
Thanks.
I'd like that.

07:58.676 --> 08:00.711
I get a whiff
of the immigrant

08:00.745 --> 08:02.813
from these
newfangled superheroes.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.520
Hmm.

08:09.554 --> 08:13.524
Reclusive millionaire,
stately mansion, damaged psyche.

08:14.559 --> 08:16.260
He's just like me.

08:16.294 --> 08:19.763
Smithers, I, too, shall become
a crime-fighting bat.

08:19.798 --> 08:20.798
Hmm.

08:20.832 --> 08:22.733
But I won't become just any bat.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.869
I shall be the terrifying bat
who swoops from the sky

08:25.904 --> 08:28.539
and sucks the vital essence
of his prey.

08:28.573 --> 08:31.275
I shall be Fruit Bat Man!

08:31.309 --> 08:32.743
Great, great.

08:32.777 --> 08:34.912
I-I don't suppose you'll be
forgetting about this tomorrow?

08:34.946 --> 08:36.880
No sooner than I'd
forget my own mother.

08:36.914 --> 08:38.615
That's not your mother,
that's your bear.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.751
Well, then, where's
my stuffed mother?

08:45.223 --> 08:48.525
All right, you soft-skulled
nitwits, sit up straight,

08:48.560 --> 08:51.328
because we finally have someone
in this school

08:51.362 --> 08:53.063
who deserves your respect:

08:53.097 --> 08:55.499
former Attorney General
Janet Reno.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.468
Thank you, Gary.

08:58.503 --> 09:00.103
Grampa's story was true?

09:00.138 --> 09:03.774
First, I would like to say,
rook to E-8. Checkmate.

09:03.808 --> 09:04.842
Dagnabbit!

09:06.177 --> 09:08.412
Youth court is now in session.

09:08.446 --> 09:10.080
God, I love gaveling.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.381
Mr. Prosecutor?

09:11.416 --> 09:13.116
Over the next few days,

09:13.151 --> 09:14.184
you're going to hear

09:14.219 --> 09:16.119
how the defendant,
Bartholomew Simpson,

09:16.154 --> 09:19.056
aka the Springfield Egger...

09:19.090 --> 09:20.624
Objection!
Prejudicial!

09:20.658 --> 09:21.525
Sustained.

09:22.594 --> 09:23.894
She sustained me.

09:23.928 --> 09:26.430
How Bartholomew Simpson wantonly

09:26.464 --> 09:28.866
egged this town
with Milhouse aforethought.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.033
Now, hold on.

09:30.068 --> 09:32.436
Principal Skinner,
are you wearing hard-soled shoes

09:32.470 --> 09:33.770
on this gym floor?

09:33.805 --> 09:35.606
No, ma'am. Sneakers.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.308
You're wearing sneakers
to a trial?

09:38.343 --> 09:40.978
Oh, God, the press is gonna have
a field day with this.

09:41.012 --> 09:42.279
Yay, field day!

09:42.313 --> 09:44.815
I can go cuckoo and
no one can stop me!

09:44.849 --> 09:47.184
That's exactly
what George W. Bush said

09:47.218 --> 09:48.619
when he was inaugurated.

09:48.653 --> 09:49.786
People don't remember that.

09:49.821 --> 09:50.954
This case is going great.

09:50.989 --> 09:52.556
Although as usual,
I look nothing like

09:52.590 --> 09:53.924
the courtroom artist's drawing.

09:54.926 --> 09:57.094
Nice try, Pop.

10:00.465 --> 10:02.165
Very dramatic, sir.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.468
A little
more brooding, and...

10:04.502 --> 10:05.702
there's my superhero.

10:05.737 --> 10:07.271
Now let's get you
to bed and...

10:07.305 --> 10:08.705
Hist. Look there.

10:09.841 --> 10:12.643
This looks like a job
for Fruit Bat Man.

10:14.646 --> 10:16.513
Perhaps we should, uh,
just call the police.

10:16.548 --> 10:17.748
The police? Bah!

10:17.782 --> 10:19.983
Every last man on the take.

10:20.018 --> 10:22.085
And I should know,
because I'm on the give.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.987
I've never felt more alive!

10:26.391 --> 10:29.626
Look, I'll give you each
$1,000 if you pretend to let

10:29.661 --> 10:31.528
that old man out there
stop this crime.

10:31.563 --> 10:32.496
Mm.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.265
Mm.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.834
Feel the crumbling
fist of justice!

10:37.869 --> 10:39.303
Ouchers.

10:39.337 --> 10:40.938
Oh, dear.

10:40.972 --> 10:44.141
Who are you, mysterious
octogenarian of the night?

10:44.175 --> 10:46.376
I am the squeak in the rafters,

10:46.411 --> 10:47.878
the flutter in
the chimney,

10:47.912 --> 10:50.147
the tiny teeth
marks in the peach.

10:50.181 --> 10:52.316
I am Fruit Bat Man.

10:52.350 --> 10:56.119
Now back to my natural realm,
the inky night.

10:58.456 --> 11:01.124
D'oh!

11:01.159 --> 11:04.661
I'll just take one of
these key chain penlights.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.597
You have to keep
squeezing this thing?

11:06.631 --> 11:08.131
Who has the
strength for that?

11:09.834 --> 11:12.669
So when I came in,
the Monday after Easter,

11:12.704 --> 11:14.705
I noticed
three dozen eggs missing.

11:14.739 --> 11:17.207
And do you think this boy
took those eggs?

11:17.241 --> 11:20.077
Him? All he takes are sodas
and desserts.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.912
Objection! Unhealthy!

11:21.946 --> 11:23.714
But could Bart have
gotten those eggs?

11:23.748 --> 11:24.982
No way.

11:25.016 --> 11:26.717
They were under lock and key.

11:28.119 --> 11:29.920
No one could have touched
those eggs

11:29.954 --> 11:32.522
except me and the seagulls
that laid them.

11:32.557 --> 11:34.057
No further questions.

11:35.593 --> 11:37.928
Ah, to be young and on trial.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.863
♪

11:57.215 --> 12:00.217
♪

12:14.932 --> 12:18.035
A toast to our enigmatic
new protector,

12:18.069 --> 12:20.103
who certainly isn't me.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.805
Smithers, wink my eye.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.409
Want to hit the
hot tub, Burnsie?

12:25.443 --> 12:27.411
Well, I hate to
get all pruney,

12:27.445 --> 12:30.480
but heated tubbery is
what we playboys do.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.549
Great work, everyone.
That's a wrap.

12:34.786 --> 12:37.354
It's nice to make an old man
feel good about himself.

12:37.388 --> 12:38.722
You said it.

12:40.525 --> 12:43.160
So Bart couldn't
have taken the eggs.

12:43.194 --> 12:44.961
I was with him
the whole weekend.

12:44.996 --> 12:46.329
You'd make up any lie

12:46.364 --> 12:48.198
for that Simpson boy,
wouldn't you?

12:48.232 --> 12:51.001
Yeah, but I'd pee my pants.

12:51.035 --> 12:52.602
Nelson.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.504
Dry as a bone.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.708
Now, that's what I call

12:57.742 --> 13:00.043
"legal briefs."

13:00.078 --> 13:02.279
I thought of the joke
and rushed over.

13:02.814 --> 13:03.914
Your Honor,

13:03.948 --> 13:05.282
I think we've
seen enough.

13:05.316 --> 13:07.451
I have demolished the
prosecution's claims

13:07.485 --> 13:10.687
and made the prosecutor
sweat through two shirts.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.322
I move that you dismiss
this case

13:12.356 --> 13:14.958
and release this
sweet, lovable boy.

13:14.992 --> 13:16.693
Motion denied.

13:17.495 --> 13:18.729
Miss Simpson,

13:18.763 --> 13:21.198
your grandstanding summation
contained a grievous error.

13:21.232 --> 13:23.166
By calling your brother
sweet and lovable,

13:23.201 --> 13:25.168
you opened the door to testimony

13:25.203 --> 13:27.804
from anyone who doesn't think
he's sweet and lovable.

13:27.839 --> 13:30.874
The prosecution calls
everyone in the world!

13:41.021 --> 13:42.163
Mr. Szyslak,

13:42.164 --> 13:44.532
what name did the defendant
ask for

13:44.567 --> 13:46.501
when he called you at your bar?

13:46.535 --> 13:47.836
He asked for, um...

13:49.171 --> 13:50.605
...Mike Rotch.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.473
And then what did you say?

13:52.508 --> 13:54.475
Well, I said, um...

13:54.510 --> 13:56.277
I said, "Mike Rotch."

13:56.312 --> 13:59.180
Um, "Mike Rotch."

13:59.215 --> 14:00.548
And then I...

14:00.583 --> 14:02.317
I'm sorry.

14:02.351 --> 14:03.818
Take all the time you need.

14:03.853 --> 14:06.988
I, uh, I, uh, I yelled out,

14:07.022 --> 14:10.091
"Has anybody seen
Mike Rotch?"

14:11.327 --> 14:13.094
See, they...

14:13.128 --> 14:16.431
See, they thought I was asking
if anybody wanted to see...

14:16.465 --> 14:18.233
my-my...

14:18.267 --> 14:21.402
Oh, man, this is so painful.

14:21.437 --> 14:24.806
My crotch.

14:28.777 --> 14:30.745
Thank you
for your bravery today.

14:30.779 --> 14:31.946
I just had to make sure

14:31.981 --> 14:33.701
that he never did this
to another bartender.

14:34.850 --> 14:38.353
Pass the gravy,
Gloria All-Wrong.

14:38.387 --> 14:41.990
The trial's not over, and
gravy is dead animal juice.

14:42.024 --> 14:44.492
Hmm?

14:44.526 --> 14:45.894
Hmm.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.664
Just remember this:
a Simpson never gives up.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.834
You got to be kidding!

15:02.044 --> 15:03.444
A civilian.

15:03.479 --> 15:04.879
She mustn't know
I'm a hero.

15:04.914 --> 15:06.114
Gouge her eyes out.

15:07.216 --> 15:08.750
Mr. Burns,

15:08.784 --> 15:10.251
I came here because my brother

15:10.286 --> 15:12.186
is about to be
wrongfully convicted,

15:12.221 --> 15:13.788
and the man
I'm looking for

15:13.822 --> 15:15.290
would help me find the truth.

15:15.324 --> 15:16.391
Don't you get it?

15:16.425 --> 15:18.293
I don't care who you are
or what you want.

15:19.328 --> 15:20.962
Now get lost.

15:23.232 --> 15:25.300
I think you just sent away
the first person

15:25.334 --> 15:27.302
you could have
actually helped.

15:27.336 --> 15:29.070
What do you mean,
"actually"?

15:29.104 --> 15:30.905
I've punched out four Homer
Simpson shaped burglars

15:30.940 --> 15:32.373
tonight alone.

15:32.408 --> 15:34.809
All those crooks were fakes,
set up by me.

15:35.844 --> 15:37.378
Even the Abominable Dr. Lenny?

15:37.413 --> 15:38.913
No, he was a
happy accident.

15:38.948 --> 15:41.049
But the rest were
fakes, just like you,

15:41.083 --> 15:43.351
a man who claims to be a
hero but is nothing more

15:43.385 --> 15:45.720
than a fraud with
a cute little bod.

15:48.257 --> 15:52.060
They're calling for you, sir,
but who's gonna answer?

15:54.530 --> 15:55.730
Ah!

15:55.764 --> 15:57.765
What the hell is that?!

16:02.961 --> 16:05.763
And so I've learned that
the only true Batmen

16:05.764 --> 16:08.000
are Christian Bale
and Adam West.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.003
Why are you washing
Bumblebee Man's pants?

16:11.037 --> 16:13.105
I volunteered to wash
the egg stains

16:13.139 --> 16:14.406
off everyone's clothes.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.175
It's one of those things you say

16:16.209 --> 16:18.510
and hope nobody
takes you up on it.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.046
That's odd.
What's odd?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.448
This skirt has a small splatter.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.049
Splatter?
Splatter as if the egg

16:24.084 --> 16:25.617
had been crushed
against it by hand.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.618
I don't follow.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.853
Like someone faked being hit,

16:27.887 --> 16:29.188
so they wouldn't be a suspect.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.056
Interesting,
except you missed one thing.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.624
What's that?
It's not a skirt.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.059
It's a kilt!

16:38.832 --> 16:40.099
Oh, the wood chipper.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.834
Is there any sweeter music?

16:41.868 --> 16:43.302
Why'd you do it, Willy?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.573
Because the world is better
off with four fewer Welshmen!

16:47.607 --> 16:49.408
Wait, what are we
talking about?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.543
This kilt says you framed
my brother.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.745
Why?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.646
Because I hate Easter.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.916
You see, ladies, I'm not
just a Presbyterian,

16:57.951 --> 17:00.753
I'm a Scottish
Old Believer Presbyterian!

17:02.188 --> 17:04.423
Old Believers don't
recognize holidays

17:04.457 --> 17:06.791
not celebrated by the
original apostles,

17:06.826 --> 17:09.328
especially one
named after

17:09.362 --> 17:11.997
the pagan god, Eostre!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.999
But how did you get the key?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.468
I made sweet love
to Lunchlady Dora,

17:16.502 --> 17:18.137
<i>then copied the key</i>
<i>as she slept.</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:21.573
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.209
Now, as for
your evidence...

17:27.614 --> 17:31.150
Behold, the pointed
ears of justice.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.487
Ah! A human fruit bat!

17:43.563 --> 17:46.632
You're so light.
It's like fighting a silk scarf!

17:46.666 --> 17:48.200
Or a kimono sash!

17:48.234 --> 17:51.670
Yes, feel the weightless
tickle of justice.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.983
Which side won?

18:05.018 --> 18:06.151
Good or evil?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.386
Good.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.854
And which side
was I on?

18:08.888 --> 18:10.055
Also good.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.790
Well,
there's two surprises.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.627
Will the defendant please rise?

18:15.662 --> 18:19.798
It's amazing how much exercise
I've gotten from those words.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.533
Pause the inquisition!

18:22.669 --> 18:24.903
Behold the real
egg-flinging fiend.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.939
Aye, 'tis true.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.475
I pulled the prank, for
some daft Scottish reason.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.112
I'd fire that man if he weren't
so damned good at what he does.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.181
We have a school
full of professionals, sir.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.116
Really? Where
is that school?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.551
Inside your head?

18:39.586 --> 18:42.955
Another mystery solved
by Attorney General Janet Reno.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.656
Case dismissed.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.860
You saved me, Lis.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.930
For the rest of my life, you'll
always be my one phone call.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.334
Aw, but I do hope you'll try
to be good from now on.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.035
Don't need to;
I got you.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.738
Children,
let me be clear.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.473
Despite what happened here,

19:01.507 --> 19:03.642
last minute confessions,
shackled Scotsman

19:03.676 --> 19:07.346
and meddling billionaires are
not how the legal system works.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.081
Well, the last one is.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.250
Today, you were
truly a hero.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.184
Thank you.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.352
Excellent.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.354
You know,
if you're gonna be a hero,

19:15.388 --> 19:17.856
you might not want to tent
your fingers like that.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.191
Is this better?

19:19.225 --> 19:21.693
Maybe you should wrap your hands
behind your head.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.096
Maybe I should wrap them around
your gabby little throat.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.099
Ah! Tenting, tenting!
Back to the tenting!

19:31.337 --> 19:32.304
Acquitted?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.206
Then my nightmare isn't over!

19:37.944 --> 19:42.944
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

19:50.290 --> 19:54.159
Well, Fruit Bat Man,
it seems you're no match for me,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.428
the Abominable Dr. Lenny!

20:04.103 --> 20:05.871
Gentlemen,
this threat is too great

20:05.905 --> 20:07.572
for just one elderly hero.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.708
We have no choice
but to activate

20:09.742 --> 20:12.444
The Octogenarian Initiative.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.346
<i>The Rambler...</i>

20:14.380 --> 20:18.016
And then there was the time
I taught a dog to make oatmeal.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.354
<i>...Early Bird,</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:25.857
<i>Hot Flash,</i>

20:25.892 --> 20:28.794
<i>Iron Lung.</i>

20:28.828 --> 20:30.796
It is time to pull up...

20:30.830 --> 20:32.831
<i>The Dependables.</i>

20:37.136 --> 20:38.704
I open one,
no trump.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.938
Double.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.708
You've just made
a powerful enemy.

21:26.045 --> 21:27.257
Shh!
