00:00.502 --> 00:02.568
How does it feel to be
a murderer?

00:02.569 --> 00:05.368
You visited Doris.
You poisoned the tonic.

00:05.369 --> 00:07.635
And somehow the bottles
were mislabeled.

00:07.636 --> 00:09.168
- It was suicide.
- But it wasn't.

00:09.169 --> 00:11.934
So you would rather think
that I killed an innocent woman

00:11.935 --> 00:13.568
for some bizarre Communist plot

00:13.568 --> 00:15.568
than that Regina was out
to harm me?

00:15.568 --> 00:16.435
Yeah.

00:16.436 --> 00:20.368

of any of the crowd,

00:20.369 --> 00:21.701

to answer to.

It's Sarah.

for being homosexual.

any stigma attached to him.

I doubt George will thank you.

Harry.

00:32.968 --> 00:34.735
He can't see me.

00:34.736 --> 00:35.535
He can't.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.335
If you weren't so pathetic,
you'd be laughable.

00:39.302 --> 00:40.701
It's a really good story.

00:40.702 --> 00:44.701
A roman à clef inevitably risks
offending or causing pain.

00:46.736 --> 00:48.501
We never used the word.

00:48.502 --> 00:51.435

you could rape my daughter

00:51.436 --> 00:53.134
and suffer no consequences.

00:53.135 --> 00:56.301
You say anything, and the world
will know she's a slut.

moving back into the house.

we will move you to the cottage.

Sarah with George's child,
our smug smiles,

02:44.102 --> 02:46.301
and banishment
to the guest cottage.

02:46.302 --> 02:48.302
A touch too much excitement.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.135
She did take luggage.

02:50.968 --> 02:53.868
A single suitcase and no driver,

02:53.869 --> 02:55.835
which suggests
a temporary flounce

02:55.836 --> 02:57.701
rather than any
extended absence.

02:57.702 --> 02:59.368
She's up to something.

02:59.369 --> 03:01.201
I beg your pardon.

03:01.202 --> 03:04.234
She loves being driven around,
so why not today?

03:04.235 --> 03:05.735
A driver knows
where he's taking you,

03:05.736 --> 03:08.169
so wherever she's headed,
she doesn't want you knowing.

such fine intentions.

03:49.769 --> 03:52.334
The marriage is a simple
convenience.

03:52.335 --> 03:55.635
And legal,
which is not easily abandoned.

I won't have our baby labeled
a bastard.

04:03.836 --> 04:07.034
We can go around and around
the problems

04:07.035 --> 04:09.836
or we can consider
a happier future.

I won't be elected.

I'll consolidate the position
in Canberra.

04:26.569 --> 04:30.335
When the time is right,
Regina and I will divorce.

04:31.068 --> 04:36.335

05:14.536 --> 05:16.368
One final thing.

05:16.369 --> 05:17.835
I told the family
about the baby.

05:17.836 --> 05:19.435
You had no right to do that...

05:19.436 --> 05:21.769
Regina found a codicil
to my will.

05:22.369 --> 05:24.435
I didn't want them hearing it
from her.

05:24.436 --> 05:26.436
They're sworn to silence.

about this?

I'm not sure.

05:31.369 --> 05:32.536
Why?

05:34.302 --> 05:36.302
It could explain something.

05:37.869 --> 05:40.102
Be very careful of her, George.

05:40.935 --> 05:42.435
She's under control.

as you think.

I can't imagine you're thrilled
by yesterday's events.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.168

to that woman.

06:29.169 --> 06:31.568

06:31.569 --> 06:34.134
But Nordmann was doing
her rounds

06:34.135 --> 06:35.934
in the days
leading up to the murder.

her cottage unlocked

then, doesn't it?

to remove her.

with her...

to that filthy whore.

15:20.803 --> 15:23.701

I won't say it again.

it,

to toady to him

behind my back?

to go sailing in for you

15:56.169 --> 15:57.334

31:04.436 --> 31:07.235
(DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING)

31:15.636 --> 31:18.835
At the very least
we have to expose her...

31:18.836 --> 31:21.134

her chance of rebuttal.

31:21.135 --> 31:22.168
It's a tall order.

31:22.169 --> 31:26.002
Well, I've formed a plan
which may well work.

her persona is unassailable.

You've been dismissed as a Red,
sowing dissent.

31:32.769 --> 31:35.067

31:35.068 --> 31:36.668
There is, however, one person

31:36.669 --> 31:39.568
who could overturn
her untarnished reputation,

31:39.569 --> 31:41.334

you're comfortable

about bringing her
into our confidence.

Even knowing all I do about her,
I can't believe it.

31:53.836 --> 31:54.902
That's exactly the problem.

You accept it

32:02.636 --> 32:06.568
Others, on plain facts,
may see it as vicious fancy.

32:06.569 --> 32:07.768
So she'll get away with it?

32:07.769 --> 32:09.402
She has.

32:09.935 --> 32:11.768
Legally.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.736
But there is the court
of public opinion.

plays out.

Now, you remember what I said
about a roman á clef?

32:18.636 --> 32:21.034
Readers recognize the truth
behind the fiction.

32:21.035 --> 32:24.034
And reputations can be slayed.

32:24.035 --> 32:27.902
Suppose you wrote a novel
in the vein of Josephine Tey.

32:27.903 --> 32:30.301
Death by poison
of a young schoolteacher...

32:30.302 --> 32:32.868
well, perhaps make her
a librarian...

32:32.869 --> 32:34.668
and the story surrounding it.

32:34.669 --> 32:37.836
Names and places changed,
but sufficient to the purpose.

32:38.569 --> 32:41.835
That's the work of months and a
good year before it's published.

32:41.836 --> 32:44.735
Well, justice delayed
is better than none at all.

32:44.736 --> 32:47.101
But she won't just read it
and confess.

32:47.102 --> 32:50.435
Oh, believe me, this is
much better than a confession.

32:50.436 --> 32:54.134
Locals who read the book
will see the obvious parallels.

but...

33:18.935 --> 33:21.501
A book has longevity, substance.

33:21.502 --> 33:24.401
It will sit in bookshops,

in her side.

brilliance to the whole thing.

33:30.636 --> 33:32.334

but better than that she escapes
censure altogether.

Someone's playing a cruel joke.

42:04.702 --> 42:06.368
You did what you did.

42:06.369 --> 42:08.635
Mother retaliated.

42:08.636 --> 42:10.635
Call that an end
to the savagery.

42:10.636 --> 42:12.701
My book feels unbalanced.

42:12.702 --> 42:15.102
But, uh, what's it got to do
with this?

42:16.369 --> 42:21.435
Somehow, someday...
there will be justice.

42:21.436 --> 42:23.601
I'm more sinned against
than sinning.

42:23.602 --> 42:24.369
Hmm?

42:28.135 --> 42:29.835
Must be unsettling,

42:29.836 --> 42:35.669
having someone send something so
indicative of malicious intent.

42:36.836 --> 42:38.636
You can leave now.

42:39.068 --> 42:42.068
I am up to anything
you toss at us.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.536
I'm the master
of the curve ball.

42:57.302 --> 42:59.134
ROY:
Ruddy long way to go about it.

42:59.135 --> 43:01.934
Yeah, but at least it's <i>a</i> way.

43:01.935 --> 43:03.967
George will finally see her
for what she is,

43:03.968 --> 43:05.401
and then the rest of the world.

43:05.402 --> 43:07.001
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Three months.

43:07.002 --> 43:09.201
A lot of time
for her to do damage.

43:09.202 --> 43:11.201
I'll be cautious.

43:11.202 --> 43:13.101
It's not such a long time.

43:13.102 --> 43:14.968
It's not just you now.

43:21.569 --> 43:22.803
Penny for your thoughts.

43:24.569 --> 43:26.903
Takes me back
to my Resistance days.

43:28.102 --> 43:31.869
Never spring the ambush
until it's fully in place.

43:35.302 --> 43:37.902
(DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING)

43:37.903 --> 43:41.636
I'm so glad you saw my argument,
Henry.

43:42.302 --> 43:44.301
He'll need it
during the election.

43:44.302 --> 43:46.768
The pain has made him
quite fractious.

43:46.769 --> 43:49.769
It's resulted
in our current alienation.

43:50.669 --> 43:52.868
I did try to convince him
earlier.

43:52.869 --> 43:55.435
And he would have none of it,
I'm sure.

43:55.436 --> 43:59.134
If it's here, I'm in a position
to subtly suggest

43:59.135 --> 44:00.968
should it become necessary.

44:01.569 --> 44:03.835
It's a drug
that needs vigilance,

44:03.836 --> 44:05.535
but it's pointless
him suffering.

44:05.536 --> 44:07.369
Exactly.

44:08.402 --> 44:10.803
How lucky he is to have you.

44:11.968 --> 44:14.102
He's lucky to have your concern.

44:15.169 --> 44:16.636
Mrs. Bligh.

Hello?

44:45.102 --> 44:46.369
It's me.

44:50.035 --> 44:53.034
You and Livvy carried off dinner
with aplomb.

44:53.035 --> 44:55.636
She's a wonderful woman.

44:57.968 --> 45:00.202
It felt marvelous sitting there
between you both.

45:02.536 --> 45:05.169
It's not something
I ever would have expected.

45:09.169 --> 45:10.602
Two people who love you.

45:13.935 --> 45:16.002
(CLEARS THROAT)

45:17.536 --> 45:20.101
It's, um... it's okay.

45:20.102 --> 45:21.702
You don't have to say it.

45:23.002 --> 45:24.369
Yes, I do.

45:27.068 --> 45:28.669
I do love you.

to say the least.

46:47.302 --> 46:48.735
Sarah, you remember Henry.

46:48.736 --> 46:50.035
Sister Miracle.

They're still talking about
your saving George's life

is a friend of mine.

Harry Polson.

47:05.235 --> 47:06.536
Pleased to meet you.

47:07.636 --> 47:08.768
We can't stop.

47:08.769 --> 47:10.702
Going to be late for breakfast.

I hope all goes well.

47:13.836 --> 47:15.435
Thank you.

Well, it was nice
to see you again.

He doesn't want to know me.
