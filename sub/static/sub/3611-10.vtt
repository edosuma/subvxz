00:02.003 --> 00:03.994
Previously on Lost:

00:04.088 --> 00:06.249
- Are you one of them?
- One of who?

00:06.340 --> 00:07.841
- A Hostile.
- What's your name?

00:07.925 --> 00:09.916
Ben. Take me with you.

00:10.428 --> 00:14.137
If that's what you really want,
I want you to think about that.

00:15.391 --> 00:19.350
You're gonna have to be
very, very patient.

00:19.437 --> 00:22.270
Do you want to protect
your friends or not, Sayid?

00:23.941 --> 00:26.478
I'm Sayid Jarrah,
one of the Oceanic Six.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.996
Stop right there!

00:44.795 --> 00:46.535
- Sayid?
- Jin.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.750
Shut up!

00:49.675 --> 00:53.543
Get down!
Say another word and you're dead.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.469
I brought you a sandwich.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.218
- Are you a Hostile?
- Do you think I am?

00:58.309 --> 01:00.675
- What's your name?
- Sayid.

01:01.938 --> 01:03.474
I'm Ben.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.555
It's nice to meet you, Ben.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.122
- Hi, Phil.
- Hey.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.330
I brought another sandwich for him.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.925
Chicken salad this time.

03:37.009 --> 03:40.547
I don't think it's the menu.
He's not eating.

03:40.638 --> 03:43.630
- Save yourself the trouble, kid.
- Horace told me to.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.101
Why does he care so much?
The guy's a Hostile.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.518
- That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
- Whatever.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.069
I brought you a sandwich.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.068
And a book.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.452
I've read it twice. It's good.

04:10.543 --> 04:11.658
Thank you.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.205
Did Richard send you?

04:17.007 --> 04:20.374
Richard. He's your leader, right?

04:24.473 --> 04:26.634
It's just a camera.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.807
They can see but they can't hear.

04:30.896 --> 04:35.265
Four years ago I ran away
into thejungle and Richard found me.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.860
I said I wanted to leave,

04:36.986 --> 04:39.944
that I wanted to join you.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.521
So I've been patient.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.700
And if you're patient, too...

04:48.372 --> 04:49.953
...I think I can help you.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.846
- How did it go?
- He tried to bribe me.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.350
- It didn't work.
- Of course it didn't.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.719
Where to now?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.979
Nowhere.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.274
- You're done.
- What do you mean I'm done?

06:42.361 --> 06:46.400
We're done.
Andropov was the last one.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.574
You've taken care of everyone
who posed a threat to your friends.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.368
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Sayid.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.242
So that's it?

06:57.918 --> 07:01.081
I killed all those people for you,

07:01.171 --> 07:03.583
and now you're just walking away?

07:03.674 --> 07:06.541
You didn't kill them for me, Sayid.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.669
You're the one that asked
for their names.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.677
There's no one else in Widmore's
organization we need to go after.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.766
Congratulations.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.765
Mission accomplished.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.441
What do I do now?

07:23.861 --> 07:27.399
I suppose you should go live your life.
You're free, Sayid.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.630
Put out your hands.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.172
Come on.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.066
Thank you.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.657
It's nice to finally hear your voice.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.364
l'm Horace.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.575
Now's the part
where you tell me your name.

08:25.381 --> 08:28.873
I need you to tell me what
you were doing out in thatjungle.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.504
- Ask him about the model.
- Radzinsky.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.960
I got this.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.927
Those handcuffs...

08:38.852 --> 08:42.765
Are you having some kind of problem
with your people?

08:42.856 --> 08:47.099
Either you are in some disagreement
which makes me want to help you,

08:47.194 --> 08:50.402
or you're a spy
trying to infiltrate us.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.113
So which is it?

09:03.419 --> 09:05.034
OK.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.628
I'm gonna give you an hour to decide
whether you want to talk to me.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.376
But if you decide you don't want to...

09:16.932 --> 09:19.844
...then I'm gonna have to
take this to the next level.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.830
I think your bacon's ready.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.166
| forgot.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.168
What's on the TV?

09:59.558 --> 10:02.391
- It's over, isn't it?
- What's over?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.475
This.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.470
Us. Playing house.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.806
All of it.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.689
I never actually thought
they'd come back.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.982
So they're back. Nothing's changed.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.527
What if Sayid tells them who he is?

10:17.659 --> 10:19.615
Sayid ain't saying nothing.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.829
Hey...

10:23.916 --> 10:25.872
I got this under control.

10:34.927 --> 10:37.509
- Morning, H. What's up?
- Jim.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.759
- Juliet. | just spoke to the prisoner.
- Horace.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.090
We have a problem.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.677
- Why? What'd he say?
- Nothing.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.308
Which is what worries me.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.980
We need to find out
why he violated the truce.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.605
Why the hell he would
come into our territory.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.695
I'm just going to have to have
Oldham do his thing on him.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.945
That psychopath? No way.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.489
What choice do l have?

11:05.666 --> 11:07.247
Let me have a go at him alone.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.918
Be my guest, but I'm telling you,
man, he is not gonna talk.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.750
He'll talk to me.

11:18.262 --> 11:20.253
- Mr. LaFleur.
- Take your lunch, Phil.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.846
- You're going back there alone?
- Take your lunch, Phil.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.812
Yes, sir.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.227
How you doing?

11:36.321 --> 11:40.985
A 12-year-old Ben Linus
brought me a chicken salad sandwich.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.155
- How do you think I'm doing?
- Sweet kid.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.824
How can you live with him here?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.083
- 'Cause I ain't got a choice.
- Is that so?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.997
Let's see how you feel
after three years of living in the 70s.

11:56.508 --> 12:01.593
Lucky for you, I spent that time getting
myself in a position to save your ass.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.011
I'm sorry, Sayid.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.730
- What?
- When I tell 'em I got your confession,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.106
I need them to believe
you didn't give it easy.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.155
- What confession?
- We say you were trying to defect.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.359
You offer intel on the Others
in exchange for living with us.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.786
Why in God's name
would I want to do that?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.738
What am I supposed to do with you?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.915
- Let me go.
- And then what?

12:32.002 --> 12:34.584
- l can'tjust let you go.
- Why not?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.414
Because these people trust me.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.635
I've built a life here.
A pretty good one.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.840
I let you go, all that goes away.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.048
So you got yourself a choice, Chief.

12:47.142 --> 12:51.101
You cooperate and join the party
in Dharmaville. Or you're on your own.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.439
Then I guess I'm on my own.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.191
Fresh off the griddle.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.698
Don't forget to try the dipping sauces.
They bring out the ham.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.370
Thanks, Hurley.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.875
So... what's going on with Sayid?

13:16.213 --> 13:18.454
- Don't know anything yet.
- You don't?

13:18.548 --> 13:20.675
You were at Sawyer's.
What did he tell you?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.546
He told me to leave him alone
and let him do his job.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.003
And you're going to?

13:26.598 --> 13:29.180
I'll talk to Juliet,
see what she can tell me.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.009
Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you,
why would Juliet?

13:32.104 --> 13:34.311
- Why wouldn't she?
- They're together.

13:35.273 --> 13:39.016
- What do you mean they're together?
- Together. They live together.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.317
Like not as roommates.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.400
You know, together,
like you guys were?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.984
I thought it was kind of obvious.
Who couldn't see that coming?

13:49.079 --> 13:50.410
Hurley.

13:55.794 --> 14:00.254
Well, I guess I better
go make some more waffles.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.257
Did you know?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.296
Yeah.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.530
You know what I can't figure out?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.917
ls how the hell you got caught.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.542
You Hostiles are supposed to be
kings of the jungle.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.965
How dumb are you
that you got captured by these idiots?

14:47.179 --> 14:49.761
And yet you're the one
who mops up after them.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.927
Yeah, well...

14:54.019 --> 14:57.432
We'll see how cute you are once
Oldham gets done with you, pal.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.775
What the hell are you doing here?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.697
l was bringing you a sandwich.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.861
A sandwich?

15:13.955 --> 15:16.492
You never made me
a sandwich in your life.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.325
Yeah, well, I made one for myself...

15:21.379 --> 15:23.665
- So I just thought...
- Yeah?

15:24.341 --> 15:26.332
- Dad, don't!
- Don't you lie to me.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.802
What are you doing here?

15:33.642 --> 15:35.633
You made this sandwich for him?

15:37.354 --> 15:39.470
- Yes.
- Who told you to do that?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.179
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

15:41.316 --> 15:44.683
- | just thought...
- "You just thought?"

15:45.821 --> 15:47.186
Go home.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.401
Go on. I'll tell you what to think.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.070
How did you find me?

16:36.121 --> 16:37.577
llooked.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.908
What do you want, Ben?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.665
John Locke is dead.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.625
I think he was murdered.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.381
Why would anyone kill him?

16:51.178 --> 16:54.386
I'd say it was retribution
for the work you and l were doing.

16:55.640 --> 17:00.930
So you're in danger. lfl can find you,
so can the people that found Locke.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.184
The same people who,
even as we speak,

17:04.274 --> 17:07.687
are sitting outside Hugo's
mental institution.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.645
- They're watching him?
- A man in a sedan has been all week.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.272
Just waiting...

17:15.952 --> 17:18.443
...presumably for you or me
to show our faces.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.239
And that's why you're here.

17:22.334 --> 17:25.121
You came all this way
to suggest that I kill this man?

17:26.087 --> 17:27.293
You don't want to?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.497
What makes you think I want to?

17:30.634 --> 17:32.215
Because, Sayid,

17:33.303 --> 17:35.214
to put it simply,

17:35.305 --> 17:37.796
you're capable of things
most other men aren't.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.725
Every choice you've made in your life
whether it was to murder or torture

17:41.811 --> 17:44.678
it hasn't really been
a choice at all, has it?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.144
It's in your nature. It's what you are.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.851
You're a killer, Sayid.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.121
I'm not what you think I am.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.995
I don't like killing.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.828
Well, then I apologize.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.877
l was mistaken about you.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.487
All right, last chance.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.360
Got anything to say?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.536
Take him to Oldham.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.045
Oldham?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.374
Hey, man. Are we ready?

19:55.153 --> 19:57.064
Who is that man?

20:00.450 --> 20:01.815
He's our you.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.372
Better put him in the restraints.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.066
Don't worry.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.568
They're for your protection.

20:42.659 --> 20:46.402
There are side effects
to what I'm giving you.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.496
Open his mouth.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.620
Open.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.886
Don't be afraid.
Just turn your mind off.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.679
Let it take effect.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.062
It's beyond your control,

21:18.153 --> 21:20.986
so fighting it is a poor use
of your energies.

21:22.157 --> 21:27.197
You see, whether you struggle or not,
one thing's for sure, friend.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.909
You will tell us the truth.

21:42.719 --> 21:46.303
There's somebody,
somebody here in Los Angeles.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.721
- Let me take you to them.
- Who?

21:48.850 --> 21:51.887
The same person that's going
to show us back to the island.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.181
Is that what this is about?

21:56.608 --> 21:58.894
This is insane. You are all crazy.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.320
Sayid, where are you going?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.568
I don't want any part of this.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.275
And ifl see you again,

22:09.412 --> 22:11.824
it'll be extremely unpleasant
for us both.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.339
You have a menu?

22:23.801 --> 22:25.928
There you go.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.255
- Sir? Another MacCutcheon?
- Please.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.758
What's that run you?

22:33.853 --> 22:37.437
- Excuse me?
- That scotch.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.271
What's a glass of that run you?

22:41.361 --> 22:43.727
Whatever it is, it's worth it.

22:44.697 --> 22:49.361
I don't understand why someone would
pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.371
If you knew what my drink cost,
why did you ask me?

23:00.630 --> 23:04.919
Same reason I'm eating my dinner here
instead of a table.

23:06.386 --> 23:10.220
- I'll have the rib eye. Bloody.
- Yes, ma'am. Rib eye bloody.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.100
Are you a professional?

23:17.188 --> 23:18.473
A professional what?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.098
You think I'm a prostitute?

23:24.988 --> 23:28.105
I'm not a professional anything.
I just...

23:28.199 --> 23:29.860
...thought you looked sad.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.359
I like sad men.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.990
I'm sorry to hear that.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.461
So...

23:45.216 --> 23:48.583
...other than drinking alone at bars...

23:48.678 --> 23:50.509
...what do you do?

23:51.472 --> 23:52.507
For a living?

23:53.224 --> 23:54.885
l'm between jobs at the moment.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.309
So what did you do?

24:00.189 --> 24:02.100
The only thing I was ever good at.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.024
Then why did you quit?

24:06.195 --> 24:07.810
I'm trying to change.

24:11.701 --> 24:15.285
- I know why you're sad now.
- Do you?

24:15.872 --> 24:18.284
When you're that good at something,

24:18.374 --> 24:21.787
there are always going to be
people who tempt you...

24:22.462 --> 24:24.248
...into staying the same.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.423
And how do you know
so much about temptation?

24:33.890 --> 24:37.223
Buy me a glass of that scotch
and I'll tell you.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.451
Hello, there.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.737
Hello?

25:04.253 --> 25:07.586
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.666
I want you to relax
and answer them truthfully.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.427
Not that you'll have
any choice about it.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.347
- What is your name?
- Sayid.

25:19.352 --> 25:23.891
- Sayid Jarrah.
- All right, Sayid.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.597
Why were you in handcuffs
when we found you?

25:28.277 --> 25:29.983
Because”.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.442
Because I am a bad man.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.616
Were you running away
from your people?

25:36.703 --> 25:39.115
- What people?
- The Hostiles.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.451
I am not a Hostile.

25:43.126 --> 25:46.414
Then where did you come from, Sayid?

25:46.504 --> 25:48.165
I came on a plane.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.208
- What plane?
-Ajira Flight 316.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.714
And that's how
I returned to the island.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.670
Returned? You've been here before?

25:57.765 --> 26:02.976
Yes. The first time,
l was on Oceanic Flight 815.

26:03.646 --> 26:04.977
lt crashed.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.555
l was here for 100 days.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.481
And I left.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.809
Ask Sawyer.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.734
- Who's Sawyer?
- Who cares?

26:15.825 --> 26:18.237
None of this matters.
Ask him about the Flame.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.318
Quiet.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.699
What do you know about
our stations here?

26:24.667 --> 26:27.249
I know the Flame
was a communication station.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.579
The Pearl was
to observe other stations.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.416
The Swan was to study electromagnetism.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.752
- Of course that was before the inci...
- The Swan?

26:37.847 --> 26:41.010
How could he know what we were gonna
name it? We haven't built it!

26:41.100 --> 26:43.591
I told you he saw the model.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.598
- You see? He is a spy! I knew it.
- Radzinsky!

26:46.689 --> 26:49.305
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Cool it.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.145
You're all going to die, you know.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.026
What?

26:59.994 --> 27:01.985
You're going to be killed.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.458
How exactly would you know this, Sayid?

27:09.545 --> 27:11.706
Because I am from the future.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.885
Maybe I should have used
half a dropper.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.563
You used exactly enough.

27:35.822 --> 27:39.064
Bench grinder, lube equipment,
drill press, over here.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.569
Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here.
How are you with a flat-4 engine?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.159
- No idea what I'm talking about?
- No.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.457
It's OK.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.755
- Jack told you about us?
- No.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.965
Hurley, actually.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.513
It's kind of a relief, actually.

28:07.770 --> 28:10.056
I wasn't quite sure how to do it

28:10.147 --> 28:13.355
without it sounding like I was
telling you to stay away.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.649
It's fine.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.802
All right. What do we do with him?

28:46.893 --> 28:49.305
We kill him.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.514
Hold on a second.
We're not killing anyone. Right?

28:54.609 --> 28:59.228
He violated the truce. What would
they do if they caught one of us?

28:59.322 --> 29:02.359
Since when did we start acting
like them? We're civilized.

29:02.450 --> 29:06.318
Yes, we are. We have a rule of law.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.654
And we've given him
every opportunity to defend himself.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.040
Need I remind you,
this man's seen things.

29:13.127 --> 29:16.335
He knows things.
There's nothing to talk about.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.630
- He's a spy.
- You sure about that, Stu?

29:19.717 --> 29:23.460
He was trying to escape. He obviously
has problems with his people.

29:23.554 --> 29:28.139
Sharing our secrets are the quickest way
for him to solve those problems.

29:28.225 --> 29:31.353
- I'm going to need time to consider.
- Consider?

29:31.479 --> 29:35.472
The longer he's among us,
the more danger we're in.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.273
I can talk to him, Horace.
ljust need more time.

29:38.361 --> 29:40.852
No! You had your chance, LaFleur.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.687
Why are we on your clock?!

29:42.823 --> 29:46.031
Horace, you've got to call for a vote.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.862
Either we make a decision,
or I call Ann Arbor

29:52.541 --> 29:55.203
and they make it for us.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.626
Radzinsky's right.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.838
Horace, please.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.665
I can't...

30:04.095 --> 30:06.381
I can't sleep with one eye open.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.721
We have a baby now.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.765
We have to think about Ethan.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.849
We have to think about all the children.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.063
How are we going to feel safe
with this man around?

30:22.989 --> 30:27.574
I don't know what he's up to,
but we can't keep him here.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.288
We have no choice.

30:42.216 --> 30:46.084
OK. Let's put it to a vote.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.387
All in favor of Radzinsky's solution,
raise your hand.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.269
LaFleur?

31:09.035 --> 31:11.822
I would really like to say
it's unanimous.

31:33.642 --> 31:37.134
Just for the record,
I really was just there for dinner.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.929
Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?

31:44.153 --> 31:46.439
I think it's too late for that.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.447
Take it off.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.967
You so much as flinch and you're dead.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.432
So, who are you?

32:21.524 --> 32:24.106
You asked me earlier
if I was a professional?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.774
I am a professional.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.648
- l was hired to bring you to Guam.
- Who hired you?

32:28.739 --> 32:31.071
The family of Peter Avellino.

32:31.158 --> 32:34.946
The man you killed in cold blood last
year on a golf course in the Seychelles.

32:35.079 --> 32:38.617
- You're a bounty hunter?
- It doesn't matter what I am.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.993
You're going to answer
for what you've done.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.339
Hit me in the face.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.631
- What?
- Go on. You owe me one anyway,

32:56.725 --> 32:57.885
so make it a good one.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.766
I want you to take these keys
out of my pocket, let yourself out.

33:02.857 --> 33:06.315
The guard outside is Phil.
He's a dimwit.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.860
So I reckon you can get his gun
before he realizes you're out.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.404
Just promise me you won't shoot him.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.278
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm fine right here.

33:15.369 --> 33:18.236
They're gonna kill you.
They just took a vote.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.538
- Even the new mom wants you dead.
- I'm going to stay here.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.997
This morning you were
begging me to let you go. Why...

33:26.088 --> 33:27.669
Because”.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.247
...when I woke up in the jungle

33:30.342 --> 33:33.049
and I realized I was
back on this island,

33:35.347 --> 33:37.258
I felt there was no purpose to it.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.972
But now I know exactly why I'm here.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.553
To get shot? Then what?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.104
You're out of your mind.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.474
Hey.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.184
Hi.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.692
Why'd you come back?

34:37.117 --> 34:39.654
- What?
- Sayid just filled my ear with crap

34:39.745 --> 34:44.455
about his damn purpose and I wanna
know. Why did you all come back?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.336
Why, Kate?

34:53.133 --> 34:55.510
I don't know why
everyone else came back.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.672
ljust know why I did.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.861
What the hell?!

35:30.671 --> 35:32.127
You OK?

35:34.591 --> 35:38.049
Greg, grab a wrench, open those valves!
Get the hoses going!

35:44.226 --> 35:48.265
Eric, grab the fire gear!
Bill, go help Greg.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.812
- What happened?
- Three years, no burning buses.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.518
You're here one day.
Get on that hose!

36:07.833 --> 36:09.698
- Man this hose!
- We got it!

36:09.793 --> 36:12.079
- Stretch it out!
- Here you go.

36:13.005 --> 36:16.418
All security! All security!
This is LaFleur! We have a fire!

36:16.508 --> 36:18.760
Everyone get to building 15 now!

36:18.886 --> 36:20.376
Roger that. On my way!

36:43.035 --> 36:46.072
- What happened to your glasses?
- My dad.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.245
For bringing me the sandwich?

36:49.124 --> 36:52.833
I know. My father
was a hard man as well.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.703
I really hate it here.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.674
lfl let you out,

37:03.430 --> 37:04.886
will you take me with you,

37:07.476 --> 37:08.511
to your people?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.602
Yes, Ben. lwill.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.642
That's why I'm here.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.960
Are you sure we're going to Guam?

37:38.382 --> 37:39.997
Where else would we be going?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.724
Can I ask you a favor?

37:52.938 --> 37:56.021
- Can we get the next plane?
- Why?

37:56.108 --> 37:58.394
l'm superstitious
when it comes to flying.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.901
I'll buy you a rabbit's foot
at the gift shop.

38:01.989 --> 38:03.650
This is the plane we're taking.

38:15.461 --> 38:18.248
Sorry about the handcuffs,
at least we're in business.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.626
Hold up! Wait, please!
Thank you for not closing.

38:30.893 --> 38:33.384
What's he doing here?
No, he can't come!

38:34.021 --> 38:36.683
Hey, if you want to go back,
this is how it has to be.

38:36.773 --> 38:39.105
- Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
- What?

38:39.234 --> 38:42.601
- Are you working for him?
- Who's Benjamin Linus?

38:42.696 --> 38:45.688
He's a liar, a manipulator.

38:45.782 --> 38:49.070
A man who allowed his daughter
to be murdered to save himself.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.446
A monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.533
Why would I work
for somebody like that?

39:00.047 --> 39:01.537
Idid.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.373
Hide.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.358
Jin.

40:09.658 --> 40:10.773
Sayid?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.570
What are you doing here?
How did you get out?

40:16.665 --> 40:18.326
Sawyer let me go.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.033
- They were going to kill me.
- What?

40:21.128 --> 40:24.416
The prisoner escaped!
The Hostile 's no longer in custody!

40:24.506 --> 40:26.918
Be on the look out.
He could be armed.

40:28.302 --> 40:32.136
They don't know he released me.
Please, Jin, I need to keep moving.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.888
OK. Let me talk to him first.

40:40.522 --> 40:43.514
LaFleur, it's Jin here. Come in...

40:51.199 --> 40:53.030
Where'd you learn to do that?

40:55.537 --> 40:57.823
Come on. We'd better go.
He called LaFleur.

41:04.713 --> 41:07.045
You were right about me.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.872
What?

41:09.718 --> 41:11.379
I am a killer.
