WEBVTT

00:30.698 --> 00:31.949
Rapunzel, get over here!

00:42.626 --> 00:44.045
I'm sorry I did this to you.

00:44.795 --> 00:45.963
It was selfish.

00:57.183 --> 00:59.060
When I'm finished
with this little bitch...

01:00.978 --> 01:02.479
Boom.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.816
Get outta here.
Get outta here now.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.677
Is this it?

02:15.678 --> 02:18.596
We're out of gas.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.266
Doesn't that mean something's gonna...

02:22.393 --> 02:24.477
For two days now,
every time we've stopped for...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.479
- any reason, there's been a--
- A death.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.440
Yes. Or death...s!

02:30.317 --> 02:31.402
Something's weird.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.987
Just one thing?

02:33.988 --> 02:36.573
There's no...

02:36.574 --> 02:38.741
There's no Dirk Gently here.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.326
Seattle's a big city.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.412
The city doesn't matter.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.123
Either I go to the target,
or the target goes to me,

02:45.124 --> 02:46.458
the city is just a backdrop.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.921
So I'm gonna...

02:51.922 --> 02:53.548
I'm gonna stand here
until something happens.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.133
You're gonna...

02:55.134 --> 02:57.094
We're parked in front of a bus stop.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.391
Okay...

03:06.604 --> 03:10.106
So exciting that Patrick Spring
left us buried treasure.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.650
How do you even know
what we're looking for is buried?

03:12.651 --> 03:13.985
Treasure is always buried.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.029
Who said anything about treasure?

03:16.030 --> 03:18.031
We have no idea what
we're looking for, do we?

03:18.032 --> 03:20.658
I mean, what was all that stuff
you said in the trap room

03:20.659 --> 03:21.868
about "three questions one answer"?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.161
Yeah, you're right.

03:23.162 --> 03:26.206
At this point, I feel like it probably
is just going to lead to seven more maps

03:26.207 --> 03:28.625
leading to seven more secret rooms
in seven more basements.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.669
Well, we dig it up,
and we get back home.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.795
I don't like leaving Amanda alone.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.506
It'll be all right. We've got this
absolutely under control.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.425
Honestly, I'm just relieved
we got through the drive

03:37.426 --> 03:39.761
without anyone or anything
trying to kill us.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.561
<i>He knows something.</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:51.272
Of course, he knows something,
he's Patrick Spring's lawyer.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.066
Well, you'd think he'd want to tell us
if it meant finding Lydia.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.901
I'm not saying
he knows where Lydia is,

03:54.902 --> 03:58.112
but he certainly knows
who Patrick Spring's enemies were.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.155
<i>So, what now?</i>

03:59.156 --> 04:00.449
<i>We follow up on Rimmer.</i>

04:02.076 --> 04:04.535
This kind of stuff
happens to you all the time, doesn't it?

04:04.536 --> 04:07.622
- Hmm?
- I mean, weird things.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.748
Supernatural things.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.458
What's weird?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.085
Well, Patrick Spring
knowing you and I would meet

04:12.086 --> 04:13.711
and solve all those
puzzle traps together?

04:13.712 --> 04:14.921
Oh that. Yes, that's weird,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.089
but it could've been a coincidence--

04:16.090 --> 04:18.716
No. No way.
You don't just stumble into that.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.551
Well, technically,
we did just stumble into that.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.719
Okay, you know what I mean.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.472
There's some kind of thing.
Like... a power.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.558
Power? No, I'm just a man,
a normal detective man.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.768
No, there's some other thing.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.437
This holistic stuff is garbage. It's...

04:31.438 --> 04:33.064
It's you.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.399
There's something about you--

04:34.400 --> 04:36.734
Look, I'm not psychic. Drop it.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.153
- Who said you were psychic?
- You did.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.029
Didn't you?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.948
Did I, though?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.908
Look, can't you just go back
to complaining? This isn't--

04:43.909 --> 04:45.285
No, no, no.
We are having this conversation.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.452
Here--

04:46.453 --> 04:47.830
Let's do an experiment.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.753
Tell me what I drew on the napkin.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.380
- No.
- Why not?

04:57.381 --> 04:59.757
Look, I can't explain it, okay?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.843
I learned a long time ago that
things don't always make sense

05:01.844 --> 05:02.760
the way people want them to.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.346
I accept that,
and you're going to have to, too.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.389
Too.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.182
To, too. Too... Two?

05:08.183 --> 05:10.685
You want to do everything,
why don't you want to do this?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.645
Look, I don't have time for,
or interest in,

05:12.646 --> 05:15.107
talking about your
stupid picture of a cowboy.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.277
Hey! Hey, hey, wait!

06:03.447 --> 06:05.281
What are you doing?

06:05.282 --> 06:06.657
Oh, that nice chef

06:06.658 --> 06:09.327
traded me this Jeep
for the Corvette.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.495
Traded the-- Wait, what?

06:10.496 --> 06:11.662
Why?

06:11.663 --> 06:12.747
Well, I showed him our map,

06:12.748 --> 06:16.000
and he said we couldn't get
to where we need to go in that car.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.503
We're going off-road.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.254
Wait, you traded the Corvette for this?

06:20.255 --> 06:21.673
Oh, don't worry, it was just a rental.

06:22.299 --> 06:26.387
Oh, here,
I got you this new shirt in the gift shop.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.105
Did you... How could you--

06:37.106 --> 06:38.982
Well, come on,
we're wasting daylight.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.490
Now, um...

06:47.491 --> 06:49.826
So, do I, um...

06:49.827 --> 06:51.327
And then...

07:05.259 --> 07:08.678
Project Incubus,
a.k.a. "The Rowdy 3".

07:08.679 --> 07:11.764
Normally, confronting these subjects
would be a 40-man operation.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.850
I'd want 10 men
for every one of them.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.936
Well, I appreciate your confidence in me
providing adequate support, sir.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.105
That's not exactly what I was saying.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.273
Let me be clear,

07:20.274 --> 07:22.817
under no circumstances
are you to engage

07:22.818 --> 07:23.901
unless I give the word.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.902
Understood.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.029
May I suggest cinnamon?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.156
What?

07:28.157 --> 07:29.616
As the word you give.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.742
In situations like this--

07:31.743 --> 07:33.953
well, different situations from this,

07:33.954 --> 07:37.081
- I use the word "cinnamon," so I--
- Corporal Friedkin...

07:37.082 --> 07:38.040
did you read the files I gave you?

07:38.041 --> 07:40.002
Yes, sir. I read them.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.629
It was a couple days ago, though,

07:43.630 --> 07:45.923
and some of the words
were really hard to understand.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.259
"The Rowdy 3" are "Project Incubus."

07:48.260 --> 07:51.179
They were some of the first subjects
taken into Black Wing.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.640
They subside through the extortion
of psychic energy.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.059
Originally,
we classified them as vampires.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.187
Whoa. Shouldn't we have,

07:59.188 --> 08:02.356
like, wooden stakes then,
and golden bullets?

08:02.357 --> 08:05.067
No...
Golden bullets?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.653
W--

08:07.529 --> 08:11.616
We're not trying to kill anyone.
Just... follow my lead.

08:11.617 --> 08:12.910
Sir...

08:13.285 --> 08:16.412
if you don't mind me asking,

08:16.413 --> 08:18.206
why didn't they send you any back-up?

08:18.207 --> 08:22.585
I mean, why didn't they
send you more back-up?

08:22.586 --> 08:25.297
It has been suggested that I'm too close.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.424
Too emotionally involved,

08:28.425 --> 08:30.760
and that blinds me
to realities of the situation.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.844
But the truth is,

08:31.845 --> 08:34.680
no one knows these people
the way I do.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.974
If we handle this calmly,

08:36.975 --> 08:39.852
these men can be reasoned with.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.063
Understood?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.858
Cinnamon.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.693
No.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.612
No.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.994
Are you sure it was a safe idea
to get into a van with a bunch of, uh...

08:56.995 --> 08:58.246
crazy strangers?

08:58.247 --> 09:01.916
You sure it's safe idea to let
a crazy stranger in your van?

09:01.917 --> 09:03.584
Oh!
She totally flipped it!

09:03.585 --> 09:05.628
Flip-flop-flipped!

09:05.629 --> 09:09.048
This is not the first van full of assholes
that I've ridden around in.

09:09.049 --> 09:09.924
Except I was usually drunk.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.720
Bottoms up! Drink it!

09:14.721 --> 09:16.640
Whoo!

09:18.517 --> 09:21.519
So, who are...

09:21.520 --> 09:22.353
Are you guys, like--

09:22.354 --> 09:23.604
I'm Martin.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.398
That's Gripps...

09:25.399 --> 09:27.108
<i>he's Vogle,</i>

09:27.109 --> 09:28.192
<i>and that one right there,
he's Cross.</i>

09:28.193 --> 09:29.694
- I'm Cross.
- That's what he said.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.822
- Are you Dirk's friends, or--
- Who's Dirk?

09:32.823 --> 09:35.575
The guy that...
you've been following.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.952
The British guy who...

09:37.953 --> 09:39.620
you do, like, the zappy thing to.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.621
That's your friend.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.623
Ain't no friend of ours.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.292
Yeah, he's not our friend,
he's British.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.043
Yeah, we've just been
following him around

09:46.044 --> 09:48.212
since his energy tastes so good,

09:48.213 --> 09:49.505
He's got gourmet panic,
ain't that right, boys?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.715
Yeah!

09:50.716 --> 09:54.677
His energy?
What are you guys, like... hippies?

09:54.678 --> 09:55.928
No.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.471
Is that what you did to me?

09:57.472 --> 09:58.806
You like...

09:58.807 --> 10:00.766
ate my emotions?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.310
<i>You sucked the energy
out of my nerves?</i>

10:02.311 --> 10:03.436
You catch on quick.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.729
Now, that thing you got,

10:04.730 --> 10:06.731
it's like a...

10:06.732 --> 10:07.898
how would you say, uh,

10:07.899 --> 10:09.317
a buffet for us.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.194
Like fear?
Mm! Num-num-num-num.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.904
Pain? Ow!

10:13.905 --> 10:15.197
Mm! Num-num...

10:15.198 --> 10:16.991
- Confusion? Ca-caw!
- It was so crazy!

10:16.992 --> 10:18.784
We've never seen
anything like it before!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.911
You were, like, gonzo-nutballs!

10:20.912 --> 10:22.497
Yeah, your eyes were all... funny.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.958
You see anything cool?

10:25.917 --> 10:26.918
Yeah.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.756
Rimmer?

10:31.757 --> 10:34.467
Sure, I know him.
He works here.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.344
That was Gordon Rimmer's house
that got burnt down?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.386
Yes, burned to the ground.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.763
Yeah, I saw that on the news.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.972
Wait, so you think Gordon

10:39.973 --> 10:43.100
had something to do with that body
that was found in his house?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.435
Was it really Lux DuJour?

10:44.436 --> 10:46.104
It's part of an ongoing investigation.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.314
I can't believe he's really dead.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.273
You don't seem very surprised

10:49.274 --> 10:51.525
that Gordon Rimmer might have
been involved in a crime.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.444
I think everybody saw that coming.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.155
- Why?
- Well, the guy's a prick.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.366
Did you work closely with him?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.034
No, thank God.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.370
He used to be in charge
of the old animal transfer unit,

11:02.371 --> 11:03.621
but it's abandoned now.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.748
What's in it?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.124
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.168
<i>Really?</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:10.419
Yeah.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.673
You're saying that there's
an abandoned building on zoo property

11:13.674 --> 11:15.466
that Gordon Rimmer had access to?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.761
Yeah. It's condemned.
Supposed to get torn down.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.180
Well, do you think we can
get a look at this building?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.099
- I don't have keys.
- Who has keys?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.892
You'll have to talk
to the operations manager,

11:24.893 --> 11:25.976
it's a property thing.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.269
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.397
No problem.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.699
How do we know
this is the right spot?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.534
The map isn't exactly specific.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.120
Well, Patrick Spring
obviously believed in us.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.746
I kind of hoped
you'd randomly lead us

11:45.747 --> 11:46.997
to the exact right place.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.207
I did.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.875
No, I stopped the car
to check the map,

11:49.876 --> 11:51.210
and then you got out to start digging.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.795
- That's not--
- I'm sure it'll work out--

11:52.796 --> 11:54.088
as long as we find
the thing we're looking for.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.297
And what's that again?

11:55.298 --> 11:56.757
Well...

11:56.758 --> 11:58.134
we'll know it when we find it.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.135
You are psychic.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.594
No, I'm...

12:00.595 --> 12:01.930
digging.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.190
Ooh...

12:13.191 --> 12:14.650
Are you hungry?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.026
- No.
- Well, I'm starving.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.570
There's a restaurant right there.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.197
You want me
to bring you back something?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.157
Doesn't matter.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.409
Look... you really think

12:23.410 --> 12:25.494
you'll miss your opportunity
to kill Dirk Gently

12:25.495 --> 12:27.872
by...

12:27.873 --> 12:29.541
eating some human food?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.255
What's this?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.423
Sweet and sour pork.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.591
Pork?

12:38.592 --> 12:40.217
Yeah, pork.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.887
You know, pig?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.890
Why do people call it "pork"?

12:45.891 --> 12:48.309
So we don't feel guilty about eating pigs.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.603
I never seen any of this before.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.729
You've never had Chinese food?

12:51.730 --> 12:53.773
I never been to China.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.192
You must have eaten it in a restaurant.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.903
Food comes to me
when I'm supposed to eat it.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.822
Hey, listen, um,

13:01.823 --> 13:03.783
you wouldn't happen
to have any money?

13:03.784 --> 13:04.992
I have money.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.536
How much do you have?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.457
$17,000.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.923
Whose rooms are these?

13:18.924 --> 13:19.882
It's ours.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.050
What?!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.343
How?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.761
I... It's a hotel.

13:23.762 --> 13:24.763
Have you ever...

13:27.098 --> 13:29.350
You've never slept
in a hotel room before.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.310
All this stuff, your own room,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.772
it's kind of a parade just to sleep, right?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.819
Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.779
They got a shower in here?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.827
Bart, are you okay?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.539
<i>As much as I ever am.</i>

13:51.540 --> 13:53.416
You've been in there a while.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.128
<i>This drink tastes bad!</i>

13:58.129 --> 13:59.964
Drink? What...

13:59.965 --> 14:01.590
No, no, no, that's shampoo.

14:01.591 --> 14:02.967
Don't drink that!

14:02.968 --> 14:03.884
<i>That's for your hair.</i>

14:03.885 --> 14:06.220
Well, why does it got
a fruit on the bottle?

14:08.807 --> 14:11.183
Hey, Ken?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.018
Yeah?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.855
You're still here.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.195
Yeah, I am.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.741
Dirk?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.034
Don't tell me you're giving up?

14:29.035 --> 14:29.952
We've only dug, like,

14:29.953 --> 14:33.038
what, 30...

14:33.039 --> 14:34.498
million holes?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.709
I think we're in the wrong spot.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.586
We gotta double check the map.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.755
What if maybe the X's
aren't even for something buried?

14:41.756 --> 14:42.756
Well, we have to dig somewhere.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.009
I mean, I think the ground
is a great place to start.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.970
You're right,
I take it back, you're not psychic.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.138
What a relief.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.682
Look, it's late.
Let's pack it in for the night,

14:51.683 --> 14:53.392
and try another one of the marks
on the map in the morning--

14:53.393 --> 14:55.019
You gain nothing from giving up, Todd.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.105
Oh, don't start
with the Zen master stuff, okay?

14:58.106 --> 15:01.609
It worked a lot better before
I figured out you were a mess, too.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.860
Fair point.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.695
I suppose.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.865
But wouldn't it just be one more thing
you walked away from?

15:07.866 --> 15:10.075
You know, I was thinking
about those trap rooms,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.745
how you solve them,
but then there's always another,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.246
and I think...

15:14.247 --> 15:16.123
maybe life is like that, too.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.000
Just an endless series
of rooms with puzzles,

15:18.001 --> 15:20.294
and then eventually
one of them kills you.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.129
That's dark and depressing.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.423
Well, giving up is an answer, I suppose.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.549
It'd certainly be easier.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.301
<i>But it's an easy road to nowhere.</i>

15:27.302 --> 15:31.389
What if one more shovel in the dirt
is all it would take?

15:34.768 --> 15:35.935
Go ahead.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.604
One more, and then we quit.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.356
Nah, you're right, Todd.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.608
Let's move back to Kansas
and be farmers, come on--

15:42.609 --> 15:44.360
Wait, no, one more,
just to prove me wrong.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.278
No, when you're right, you're right,
and you're right, let's quit.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.030
You want to try one more,
try one more.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.075
Look, all I was saying is,
if you don't try, you'll never know.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.495
I get it!
But now I can't leave.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.305
I knew it.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.648
What is it?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.067
A thing.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.998
Let's go, boys!
Show Drummer how we have fun!

16:39.833 --> 16:42.251
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

16:42.252 --> 16:43.336
Stop!

16:44.045 --> 16:45.255
Whoo!

16:55.223 --> 16:56.641
Whoo!

16:59.477 --> 17:02.063
Go on. Hurt it.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.239
<i>Amanda!</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:14.658
Come on. Yeah.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.994
Yeah!

17:16.828 --> 17:18.038
Yeah!

17:46.107 --> 17:48.902
You're not going to have to worry
about that shit anymore.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.717
You brought the cat.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.095
Well, of course, I did.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.224
Are you ever going to tell me
why you took it from the crime scene?

18:20.225 --> 18:21.767
Hunch?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.269
Of course.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.651
My back is killing me.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.569
I haven't slept in a car
since my last band.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.570
When was that?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.697
Aw, jeez.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.366
Um...

18:37.367 --> 18:39.244
must be six years ago now?

18:41.412 --> 18:44.706
Yeah, it didn't end... perfect.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.751
I actually kind of
messed it up pretty bad.

18:47.752 --> 18:52.257
Some not great-- No, some...
some really bad choices.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.176
You know, Todd,

18:56.177 --> 18:58.428
something I've learned is that

18:58.429 --> 19:00.806
when I'm looking behind me,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.600
I can't see ahead of me.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.813
Are you saying that dwelling on my past
is holding me back?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.400
No, I literally can't see over there
when I'm looking back here.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.487
Which is why it's good
to have you here.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.613
Together,

19:16.614 --> 19:18.908
we can see
in two places at once.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.163
Wanna dig up some more weird crap
buried by a dead guy?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.332
More than anything else in the world.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.690
What does this have
to do with the missing girl?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.942
Well, we have reason to believe

19:53.943 --> 19:56.445
that she was last seen
with Gordon Rimmer.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.656
- By the, uh, the bellhop.
- Yeah, by the bellhop.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.742
- Yes, by Todd Brotzman.
- Todd Brotzman.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.744
Plus, we just spoke
to the top zoo official

20:03.745 --> 20:05.495
about getting into the
building where Rimmer worked.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.831
And they said the place,
the "animal transfer unit," is condemned.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.458
- Yeah, locked up.
- Nothing there.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.585
- Nothing there, so they say.
- And you don't believe them?

20:11.586 --> 20:15.631
No, we don't believe them, so please,
why can't we just go inside, take a look?

20:15.632 --> 20:17.508
Doesn't sound like
you got enough for a warrant.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.011
What?

20:21.012 --> 20:22.555
What is this, a joke?

20:23.431 --> 20:26.808
Gordon Rimmer
was seen with Lydia Spring.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.269
The very next day,
his house burns down,

20:29.270 --> 20:30.938
they find a body inside.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.524
His dog was visible on a tape
from the Perryman Grand!

20:34.525 --> 20:36.109
His dog!

20:36.110 --> 20:38.153
And now we're telling you
that we have access

20:38.154 --> 20:40.822
to an abandoned building,
where he used to work!

20:40.823 --> 20:43.325
And you're telling us
we can't go inside?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.577
Plus, animal control never followed up
on that missing shark.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.704
Plus, animal control--

20:49.958 --> 20:51.833
I don't see it.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.377
I don't think a judge will either.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.462
Move on.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.476
What was that?

21:09.477 --> 21:10.644
What the hell just happened to us?

21:10.645 --> 21:12.521
- Am I losing my mind?
- No, you're not losing your mind.

21:12.522 --> 21:13.563
I don't know.

21:13.564 --> 21:16.608
Maybe he's covering
for some Major Crimes shit-fit,

21:16.609 --> 21:17.901
I don't know.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.903
We're not wasting any more time.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.114
What are you thinking?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.959
Are we sure this is all of them?

21:37.672 --> 21:40.257
Here, here. Like this.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.759
That's the wrong-- Oh...

21:43.469 --> 21:45.972
Ah, yes.
No, I was just about to do that.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
<i>Tremendous assisting, Todd!</i>

21:51.519 --> 21:52.728
What do you think this thing is?

21:52.729 --> 21:55.939
Maybe Edgar Spring's machine,
the Unlimited Energy Device.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.274
- Really?
- I don't know,

21:57.275 --> 22:02.362
but if we can trade it for Lydia Spring,
I should think it's our top priority.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.657
Listen, Dirk, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.535
Do you ever, like... see things?

22:08.536 --> 22:12.622
- See things?
- Like visions of the future?

22:12.623 --> 22:13.540
No, of course not.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.792
Okay, right,
th-this might sound crazy,

22:15.793 --> 22:17.712
but when you gave me this shirt...

22:18.588 --> 22:20.672
Okay

22:20.673 --> 22:22.383
I've seen this shirt before.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.802
Listen, the day it all happened,
the day Patrick Spring died,

22:25.803 --> 22:28.096
I saw something.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.891
I saw something really--

22:31.309 --> 22:32.225
Look out!

22:40.151 --> 22:41.527
Oh, shit!

22:47.992 --> 22:49.202
Dirk!

22:51.662 --> 22:53.623
Jed, get down!
He's got the shark!

23:27.156 --> 23:28.908
A kitten and a shark...

23:30.451 --> 23:32.703
The kitten is the shark.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.373
Todd...

23:36.541 --> 23:39.168
I think we found the murder weapon.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.385
<i>No visual on the Incubus Subjects.</i>

23:48.386 --> 23:49.845
They're close.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.680
I'll handle it.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.765
You watch from here.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.268
<i>Visual on the girl.</i>

23:56.185 --> 23:58.895
Don't move.

23:58.896 --> 23:59.981
Got it.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.154
It's your birthday!

24:11.117 --> 24:12.452
Whoo!

24:18.082 --> 24:22.043
Vogle! Boys! We need to talk!
Martin, we need to talk.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.381
You should not be here.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.176
Now, the Rowdy 3
ain't got no use for you.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.469
Simmer down...

24:30.470 --> 24:32.721
You're going to have to do
more than that to scare me.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.056
Shut up with that shit!

24:35.057 --> 24:36.224
You kiss your mother
with that mouth, Cross?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.225
See what you did there?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.436
You stepped yourself
into a nasty situation.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.604
You don't tell us what to do no more--

24:40.605 --> 24:42.189
Not trying to tell you what to do,
I just wanna talk--

24:42.190 --> 24:43.482
- We should stomp his ass--
- Gripps...

24:43.483 --> 24:45.233
Your family misses you, Gripps.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.735
Your family's gonna miss you, too--

24:46.736 --> 24:49.321
What are we waiting for? It's him!

24:49.322 --> 24:51.156
He's the guy!
Let's stomp his ass!

24:51.157 --> 24:53.826
That's very tough, Vogle.
You sound like a real grown-up.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.955
You're not gonna put me
and my rowdy boys

24:58.956 --> 25:00.665
back in no cages, man!

25:00.666 --> 25:03.543
I'm trying to save your lives,
it's different this time--

25:03.544 --> 25:05.921
We're not going back to no freak zoo!

25:05.922 --> 25:07.672
<i>Drop the weapons!</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:11.301
What in God's name are you doing?

25:11.302 --> 25:12.802
Drop the weapons
and back down now!

25:12.803 --> 25:14.262
<i>Let her go now.</i>

25:14.263 --> 25:15.639
- What?
- Let her go.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.932
Let her go. Now.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.059
Just trying to take control
of the situation, sir.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.185
- We see you.
- Don't think we don't.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.770
- We're gonna get you.
- Sh-Shut up!

25:21.771 --> 25:23.313
And back down! Now!

25:23.314 --> 25:24.440
That's low...

25:26.359 --> 25:27.944
Even for your kind of scum.

25:31.239 --> 25:35.158
Don't be scared, Drummer girl.
We'll see you again.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.244
Let's go!

25:42.124 --> 25:43.750
Martin!

25:43.751 --> 25:45.294
Vogle!

25:46.128 --> 25:48.380
Goddammit!

25:48.381 --> 25:49.422
She bit me!

25:49.423 --> 25:50.715
That's enough.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.843
What? Sir, I was just...
just trying to--

25:57.056 --> 25:58.807
This is bad.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.226
This is very bad.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.686
Are we actually doing this?

26:02.687 --> 26:03.770
Yeah,
we're actually gonna do this.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.438
You're goddamn right.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.440
He was acting awfully funny.

26:07.441 --> 26:08.567
Something's wrong,
something's very wrong.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.943
We're gonna go there right now.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.027
But is it the right thing to do?

26:11.028 --> 26:12.320
<i>For Lydia.</i>

26:12.321 --> 26:13.280
<i>If she's even still alive.</i>

26:13.281 --> 26:14.447
What kinda thing is that to say?

26:14.448 --> 26:15.448
What's wrong with you?

26:15.449 --> 26:18.160
I'm trying to be positive here, stay positive.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.041
Why didn't they just kill us in our sleep
and take the map?

26:25.042 --> 26:28.295
I don't think they even knew we had it.
It was the machine they were after.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.797
- Ow!
- Hold still.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.966
Why did they have to be pink?

26:32.967 --> 26:35.468
Ask the cook, it's his jeep.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.345
Thanks, Todd.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.764
You know, for someone who constantly
talks about what an asshole he is,

26:39.765 --> 26:41.267
you're quite a good friend.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.226
What?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.769
No.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.730
No, Dirk,

26:46.731 --> 26:48.732
I'm a terrible friend.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.734
You just, like...

26:50.735 --> 26:52.486
project that friend stuff onto me.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.453
You know what I was thinking about

27:01.454 --> 27:03.289
when I was staring down
the barrel of that gun?

27:05.416 --> 27:08.501
- Bullets?
- Amanda.

27:08.502 --> 27:09.336
<i>How if I die,</i>

27:09.337 --> 27:11.088
there will be no one
to take care of her.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.674
- You're a good brother.
- No.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.593
No, I'm a shitty brother.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.095
I'm a shitty person.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.097
I was thinking about
how if I die right now,

27:21.098 --> 27:24.476
I'll never have the chance to make up
for all the stuff I've done to her.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.771
D... Done to her?

27:28.481 --> 27:30.815
Todd, I think with both of you
sharing the disease,

27:30.816 --> 27:32.233
you supporting her has been--

27:32.234 --> 27:33.694
I didn't have the disease.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.326
I didn't have Pararibulitis.

27:43.829 --> 27:48.083
- What? Then--
- It ran in my family.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.626
I lied and said I did

27:49.627 --> 27:51.336
so my parents
would send me money

27:51.337 --> 27:53.672
and I wouldn't have to work.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.757
But why--

27:55.257 --> 27:56.841
Why not just...

27:56.842 --> 27:58.051
get a job, or--

27:58.052 --> 27:59.220
I don't know.

28:03.974 --> 28:08.436
I can't even remember
the first time I lied about it.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.898
I don't even relate
to that person anymore.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.946
<i>I just...</i>

28:19.198 --> 28:20.449
I don't know.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.369
I don't know.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.133
So...

28:38.134 --> 28:43.263
when Amanda really got sick
with the disease that I was faking,

28:43.264 --> 28:48.643
I realized that she needed
the cash more than me, so...

28:48.644 --> 28:50.062
I said I got better.

28:50.896 --> 28:55.150
But it was too late.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.737
My parents had already
run out of money.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.282
But you support her...

29:02.283 --> 29:04.409
- Maybe you--
- I couldn't.

29:04.410 --> 29:08.329
She thinks I was cured of a disease
that she actually has.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.706
Do you know
how many times she's told me

29:09.707 --> 29:11.082
that's what gets her through the day?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.460
That's what gives her hope.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.840
How could I take that away from her?

29:22.303 --> 29:24.137
So...

29:24.138 --> 29:25.513
there's your assistant,

29:25.514 --> 29:28.808
friend, whatever, Dirk.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.562
I am, and always have been,
a total and complete asshole.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.492
Where's the kitten?

29:45.493 --> 29:46.744
Oh.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.162
Shit.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.331
Kitten!

29:51.165 --> 29:53.584
- Kitten! Here, Kitten.
- Kitten!

30:00.633 --> 30:01.967
Bart?

30:04.261 --> 30:05.220
Bart, wait!

30:05.221 --> 30:09.140
I'm sick of hangin' around like a coconut.
You're slowin' me down.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.559
All this sleeping and eating stuff,

30:11.560 --> 30:13.937
it distracts you from
what you gotta get done.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.939
Where are you--
What are you doing?

30:15.940 --> 30:18.233
- See? There we go.
- Wait, what are you doing?

30:18.234 --> 30:19.943
I'm gonna kill that guy.

30:19.944 --> 30:21.277
That's Dirk Gently?

30:21.278 --> 30:22.862
I don't know, Ken,
let's kill him and find out--

30:22.863 --> 30:24.948
- Wait, what?
- I thought we got over this.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.783
This is not like Red and the bikers,

30:26.784 --> 30:28.910
you can't just kill some guy,

30:28.911 --> 30:31.287
in broad daylight,
in the middle of a crowded street.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.789
It's what I do, Ken.

30:32.790 --> 30:35.667
It's all I do.
It's the will of the universe--

30:35.668 --> 30:38.253
I know, I know, okay?

30:38.254 --> 30:40.421
But you don't want
to end up in jail, right?

30:40.422 --> 30:43.967
I mean, how are you going
to fulfill your mission to kill to Dirk Gently

30:43.968 --> 30:45.301
if you're locked up in a cell?

30:45.302 --> 30:46.970
Maybe that's where Dirk Gently is.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.806
In a women's prison?

30:50.266 --> 30:51.308
You talk too much.

31:00.401 --> 31:01.442
Hey!

31:01.443 --> 31:02.695
You! Dickhead!

31:03.445 --> 31:04.362
Come over here!

31:04.363 --> 31:05.531
Come here!

31:11.328 --> 31:12.370
Listen to me,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.831
no more arguments,
no more excuses.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.959
There is no stopping me,
nobody even slowing me down.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.545
You touch me again,
you get in my way again,

31:20.546 --> 31:21.964
I'm taking your head off.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.968
Phoning 911 right now.
I don't know...

31:26.969 --> 31:28.304
I need pants.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.250
I thought this building
was supposed to be locked up.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.347
Run the plates, right?

32:12.348 --> 32:14.015
Let's check it out first.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.099
Whoa, what if they're in there?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.353
If they're in there,
then they're in there.

32:22.816 --> 32:26.152
This place has got
all kinds of code violations.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.279
You think?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.074
You ever seen graffiti like this?

32:31.075 --> 32:33.034
This is some new kind of crazy.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.911
What is this place, Zim?

32:34.912 --> 32:36.330
Stay close. Keep quiet.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.348
Oh, shit...

32:55.099 --> 32:57.434
- Oh, that stinks.
- Holy shit.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.818
Oh, my God.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.325
35 bodies. Like, 35 bodies.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.161
I wanna see the captain stonewall this,
this is headline news.

33:17.162 --> 33:17.996
Still no bars.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.998
It's gotta be all that electrical stuff
in there causing interference.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.417
Well, go, radio,
radio for some back-up.

33:22.418 --> 33:25.294
Radio for the entire forensic team.

33:25.295 --> 33:28.840
<i>Goddamn it, call the whole National Guard!</i>

33:28.841 --> 33:30.634
There is gonna be trouble.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.637
Yup...
I can smell it.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.223
Zim, I just don't think--

33:37.057 --> 33:38.350
Zim?

33:44.231 --> 33:45.148
Zim, come on, buddy.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.859
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

34:00.831 --> 34:01.748
I told you to stay down!

34:05.044 --> 34:07.336
Lydia?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.135
Zim, you with me?

34:18.932 --> 34:21.059
You need to get up.
Come on.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.895
Come on! Come on!

34:32.905 --> 34:34.739
Hang in there, Zim!

34:34.740 --> 34:36.741
You hear me?

34:36.742 --> 34:39.494
<i>Talk to me, buddy!
Hospital's only 10 minutes away.</i>

34:39.495 --> 34:40.578
<i>You hear me?</i>

34:40.579 --> 34:41.705
Zim!

34:46.710 --> 34:47.710
All right.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.253
All right, all right...

34:50.756 --> 34:53.257
No, no, no...
We're gonna get you some help.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.676
We're gonna get you some help, okay?

34:57.221 --> 34:59.472
S...

34:59.473 --> 35:01.182
<i>Save...</i>

35:01.183 --> 35:03.059
Don't, Zim, please.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.436
Save Lydia Spring.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.150
No...

35:15.197 --> 35:16.406
Oh, God...

35:18.909 --> 35:20.118
Shit, shit!

35:20.119 --> 35:21.370
No...

35:23.455 --> 35:25.873
Psst!

35:25.874 --> 35:27.416
Psst!

35:29.169 --> 35:30.586
We're never gonna find her.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.132
It's pointless,
she's long gone by now.

35:39.346 --> 35:40.848
Have you ever felt directionless?

35:42.766 --> 35:44.726
<i>Like you didn't know what to do next?</i>

35:45.853 --> 35:49.856
I thought that was your thing.
"Everything is connected."

35:49.857 --> 35:50.941
It is.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.736
Everything is connected.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.700
But only I can see it.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.204
I'm not psychic.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.206
But I am...

36:07.207 --> 36:08.375
something.

36:10.961 --> 36:14.298
When I was young, I would get...
intuitions about things.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.217
Little hunches about
the way the universe worked.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.428
But they never...

36:20.762 --> 36:23.014
It was like reading
in another language,

36:23.015 --> 36:25.349
like signs with symbols
I didn't understand.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.977
Well, then
why don't you, you know,

36:27.978 --> 36:29.937
use it to keep yourself safe, or--

36:29.938 --> 36:32.273
Because that's not how it works.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.317
The hunches don't help me.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.235
Ever.

36:36.236 --> 36:40.282
So I figured I might as well
use them to try to help other people.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.242
You're the first person

36:43.243 --> 36:44.912
who's actually
stuck around and helped.

36:46.413 --> 36:49.165
You're the first person
who's actually acted like a friend,

36:49.166 --> 36:51.375
whether you acknowledge it or not,

36:51.376 --> 36:54.879
and to be totally candid,

36:54.880 --> 36:56.715
I'm a bit sick
of your bullshit, Todd.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.090
What?

36:58.091 --> 37:01.969
Well, I just wish you'd stop
saying you're an asshole.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.889
I don't think you are,
so it comes off a bit cheap.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.098
Cheap?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.516
Have you not been listening?

37:07.517 --> 37:09.435
It's very easy to act like a jerk,

37:09.436 --> 37:12.146
and then say,
"Well, I'm a jerk so that's that."

37:12.147 --> 37:14.942
But it's not like...
being a bloody werewolf, is it?

37:15.776 --> 37:18.653
It's just you making excuses
for your excuses.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.988
I don't have any friends.

37:20.989 --> 37:25.034
I am always surrounded by bizarre
and frightening states of disaster,

37:25.035 --> 37:26.787
and I am always alone.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.831
Even you keep saying
you're not my friend.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.960
But since you're
the closest thing I've had,

37:33.961 --> 37:35.670
I'd really appreciate it

37:35.671 --> 37:37.756
if you'd stop
calling yourself an asshole.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.470
Okay.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.514
You're right.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.683
Huh?

37:48.684 --> 37:49.850
When we get back in the morning,

37:49.851 --> 37:51.686
we'll solve the murder
of Patrick Spring,

37:51.687 --> 37:52.687
save Lydia,

37:52.688 --> 37:54.773
and figure out
whatever the hell that thing is.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.276
And...

37:58.277 --> 37:59.528
I'll tell Amanda the truth.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.114
About everything.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.703
And Dirk...

38:10.580 --> 38:11.915
I am your friend.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.092
Whoa!

38:23.093 --> 38:24.927
Why do you have a knife?

38:24.928 --> 38:26.345
O-kay.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.847
Dude...

38:27.848 --> 38:29.433
I am so happy to see you.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.060
Are you okay?

38:33.061 --> 38:34.270
No.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.188
Shit's crazy.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.315
I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.607
Excellent.

38:38.608 --> 38:41.402
Yes, okay, that's good.

38:41.403 --> 38:43.654
Okay, perfect, um...

38:43.655 --> 38:45.323
<i>spectacular, uh,</i>

38:45.324 --> 38:48.200
just so you're aware,

38:48.201 --> 38:50.578
everything is under control.

38:50.579 --> 38:51.579
Everything is under, uh--

38:51.580 --> 38:53.331
Are you okay?

38:53.332 --> 38:55.374
Listen, did you talk to your brother,

38:55.375 --> 38:56.917
or, um...

38:56.918 --> 38:58.794
uh, Dirk?

38:58.795 --> 39:00.839
No. What's going on?

39:02.341 --> 39:03.842
I just saw Lydia Spring.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.895
I read your report, but I wanted
a more personal account.

39:17.314 --> 39:20.149
Shouldn't you be asking
my superior officer, Ma'am?

39:20.150 --> 39:23.194
I'm asking you, Corporal.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.653
I am ultimately
in charge of this operation,

39:24.654 --> 39:27.698
but I wanted to ask your opinion.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.367
My understanding of the mission

39:29.368 --> 39:32.244
is that we're to bring in
the subjects of Black Wing,

39:32.245 --> 39:33.412
Ma'am.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.581
Correct.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.377
We tried Project Icarus first.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.837
<i>Dirk Gently.</i>

39:41.338 --> 39:42.547
And?

39:43.882 --> 39:46.467
He said he didn't want to, Ma'am.

39:46.468 --> 39:47.843
"Didn't want to."

39:47.844 --> 39:50.513
That's right.
Didn't want to be brought in.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.432
Something about a... rough childhood,

39:53.433 --> 39:54.350
<i>Ma'am.</i>

39:54.351 --> 39:58.604
I suggested a more
aggressive approach,

39:58.605 --> 40:00.314
but Colonel Riggins rejected it.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.941
<i>I see.</i>

40:01.942 --> 40:05.152
So you next moved on
to Project Incubus?

40:05.153 --> 40:08.823
That's right, but we were
met with strong hostile response.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.158
Colonel Riggins' choice to...

40:11.159 --> 40:14.829
confront them without back-up...

40:14.830 --> 40:17.248
I suggested a more
traditional means of attack,

40:17.249 --> 40:20.836
but that was vetoed
by the Colonel, Ma'am.

40:23.630 --> 40:28.759
So your strategy
would have been to...

40:28.760 --> 40:32.388
use a more
aggressive approach?

40:32.389 --> 40:33.473
Yes, Ma'am.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.518
Truth is,

40:37.519 --> 40:39.728
Colonel Riggins is too close.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.355
He's emotionally involved,

40:41.356 --> 40:44.900
and it's blinding him
from the realities of the situation.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.445
There's a reason
why the Neanderthals fell

40:47.446 --> 40:49.156
to the Homo Erectus.

40:52.075 --> 40:55.454
Do you think you are capable
of being more aggressive?

40:56.663 --> 40:58.456
Yes, ma'am.

40:58.457 --> 40:59.791
Very erectus.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.212
Much more aggressive.
