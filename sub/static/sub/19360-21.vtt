This week on Vice: inside North Korea.

00:28.135 --> 00:30.660
I'm having a complete sensory overload.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.796
I don't know whether to
laugh or cry or be scared.

00:34.907 --> 00:36.633
And then, Somali refugees

00:36.643 --> 00:39.408
return to rebuild their nation.

00:39.418 --> 00:41.569
This street here is regularly bombed,

00:41.580 --> 00:44.273
but it turns out there's
a juice shop open.

00:44.284 --> 00:45.776
You guys got good vibes in here.

00:45.787 --> 00:48.978
We have generations that
have seen nothing but war.

00:48.988 --> 00:51.514
What we need now is human investment.

00:58.164 --> 00:59.630
Go, go, go!

01:02.434 --> 01:03.967
We are not animals!

01:15.413 --> 01:17.806
Vice has been covering
North Korea for years,

01:17.816 --> 01:20.575
and the country's relationship
with the United States

01:20.585 --> 01:22.343
has never been as unpredictable

01:22.353 --> 01:24.980
and as dangerous as it is right now.

01:24.990 --> 01:28.416
The North is testing evermore
sophisticated ballistic missiles

01:28.426 --> 01:31.919
that might soon be able
to reach American soil.

01:31.929 --> 01:35.223
And the US has threatened military
intervention if provoked.

01:35.233 --> 01:39.093
The Trump administration
is a new sheriff in town.

01:39.103 --> 01:41.929
North Korea is a problem.
The problem will be taken care of.

01:41.939 --> 01:45.200
As North Korea celebrated its
founder's birthday this year,

01:45.210 --> 01:47.768
Vice and a few other news organizations

01:47.778 --> 01:49.536
were invited to Pyongyang

01:49.546 --> 01:51.572
to witness a military display

01:51.582 --> 01:54.075
reminiscent of a
Stalinist May Day parade,

01:54.085 --> 01:56.777
a show of force that experts have warned

01:56.787 --> 01:59.321
could trigger a global nuclear war.

02:19.343 --> 02:22.468
We arrived in Pyongyang as
part of a press delegation

02:22.478 --> 02:24.503
invited by the government.

02:24.513 --> 02:27.140
We were told only that
we were about to witness

02:27.150 --> 02:30.944
a series of very
important announcements.

02:30.954 --> 02:34.114
Outside of here, the world's
talking about North Korea

02:34.124 --> 02:37.049
and what's going on here in big,
high-stakes terms.

02:37.059 --> 02:40.519
So I was expecting slightly
more of a tense vibe,

02:40.529 --> 02:42.963
but it's definitely
nowhere to be seen yet.

02:43.899 --> 02:46.559
No fancy missiles or marches yet.

02:52.475 --> 02:54.466
We've been told that
these thousands of people

02:54.476 --> 02:56.902
are all just regular Pyongyang citizens.

02:56.912 --> 02:59.571
What's most noticeable to me is

02:59.581 --> 03:02.440
the kind of palpable, subdued,

03:02.450 --> 03:05.752
quiet of everything.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.025
The eerie tranquility
stood in sharp contrast

03:21.035 --> 03:25.138
to the hysteria that was gripping
the news media everywhere else.

03:25.149 --> 03:26.741
Commercial satellite imagery

03:26.752 --> 03:30.201
shows activity at the test
site northeast of Pyongyang.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.769
Meanwhile, Reuters reported

03:31.779 --> 03:33.704
that foreign journalists
visiting North Korea

03:33.714 --> 03:35.873
have been told to prepare for a, quote,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.042
"big and important event" today.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.311
As North Korean citizens themselves

03:40.321 --> 03:43.146
were completely isolated
from these reports,

03:43.156 --> 03:45.382
we awaited a mysterious announcement

03:45.392 --> 03:47.992
from a very special surprise guest.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.820
In a perfect example of the disconnect

04:23.830 --> 04:26.689
between North Korea and
the rest of the world,

04:26.699 --> 04:29.158
this supposed nuclear announcement

04:29.168 --> 04:32.002
is actually the unveiling
of a new plaza.

04:47.486 --> 04:50.144
This would set the tone for our stay.

04:50.154 --> 04:53.482
Any visit here means,
at times, subjecting yourself

04:53.492 --> 04:55.149
to the same information bubble

04:55.159 --> 04:56.718
that North Koreans inhabit.

04:56.728 --> 04:59.087
We begin with new
concerns that North Korea

04:59.097 --> 05:01.723
could test-fire a nuclear
weapon any day now.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.192
Japan today claiming that North Korea

05:04.202 --> 05:06.527
may be capable of delivering missiles

05:06.537 --> 05:08.763
equipped with sarin nerve gas.

05:08.773 --> 05:11.366
And while we were out
here at a street opening,

05:11.376 --> 05:15.636
the US was sending a very
powerful message to Pyongyang.

05:15.646 --> 05:17.939
At around 7:00 p.m. local time

05:17.949 --> 05:19.941
in Afghanistan last night,

05:19.951 --> 05:21.376
the United States military

05:21.386 --> 05:24.978
used a GBU-43 weapon in Afghanistan.

05:24.988 --> 05:27.314
I wonder if maybe the
message on this MOAB

05:27.324 --> 05:30.017
was, "Happy birthday, North Korea."

05:30.027 --> 05:32.986
While the world news
talked of nuclear war,

05:32.996 --> 05:34.488
our government minders took us

05:34.498 --> 05:36.590
to something rather less threatening.

05:59.522 --> 06:01.581
This trip to the Children's Palace

06:01.591 --> 06:04.383
would be the first stop
on a sightseeing schedule

06:04.393 --> 06:07.587
which is the staple of
any visit to North Korea.

06:09.766 --> 06:11.924
A carefully curated PR tour

06:11.934 --> 06:15.261
designed to give an impression
of stability and prosperity

06:15.271 --> 06:17.338
in a place on the brink of war.

06:18.407 --> 06:20.866
While the outside media speculated about

06:20.876 --> 06:23.336
the supreme leader's march to war,

06:23.346 --> 06:24.937
the international news teams here

06:24.947 --> 06:28.173
were treated to an
elaborate musical recital

06:28.183 --> 06:30.809
with dancing penguins, dry ice,

06:30.819 --> 06:34.112
and a giant backdrop
of ballistic missiles.

07:04.986 --> 07:06.544
As other foreign guests

07:06.554 --> 07:08.813
danced with North Korean children,

07:08.823 --> 07:10.681
the message became clear:

07:10.691 --> 07:13.117
North Koreans are not only unaffected

07:13.127 --> 07:14.819
by these external threats,

07:14.829 --> 07:17.521
but wanted to show us that their society

07:17.531 --> 07:19.364
and military were thriving.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.993
At the Pyongyang Flower Festival,

07:23.003 --> 07:24.794
we would see a unique mix

07:24.804 --> 07:27.498
of nationalism and nuclear pride.

07:27.508 --> 07:30.800
This is an exhibition center of flowers.

07:30.810 --> 07:33.537
Namely, two types of flower,

07:33.547 --> 07:35.338
which are named after

07:35.348 --> 07:38.708
the founding father of
the DPRK and his son.

07:38.718 --> 07:42.378
They are called the Kimilsungia,

07:42.388 --> 07:44.321
and the Kimjongilia.

07:45.358 --> 07:47.417
What's the significance of the rocket?

07:47.745 --> 07:52.383
_

07:52.895 --> 07:54.498
Flowers and rockets.

07:54.509 --> 07:56.365
_

07:56.376 --> 07:57.437
_

07:57.448 --> 08:00.095
That one's a submarine-launched
ballistic missile.

08:00.106 --> 08:01.208
_

08:01.219 --> 08:03.074
Yeah, yeah.

08:04.723 --> 08:06.231
_

08:07.446 --> 08:09.038
While the outside world

08:09.048 --> 08:11.440
pondered the regime's next steps...

08:11.450 --> 08:12.875
While speculation has been growing

08:12.885 --> 08:16.278
that North Korea may be ready to
carry out its sixth nuclear test...

08:16.288 --> 08:19.582
... we were ushered through
a manufactured utopia

08:19.592 --> 08:22.417
which included a zoo,
natural history museum,

08:22.427 --> 08:25.954
and a high-end hair salon,
offering slight variations

08:25.964 --> 08:28.131
of one government-approved haircut.

08:29.701 --> 08:33.095
It's like a less-extreme version
of the supreme leader's.

08:33.105 --> 08:36.864
As families swam and we
sipped lattes at a bar,

08:36.874 --> 08:39.333
we had no idea what
was actually happening

08:39.344 --> 08:40.868
in the rest of the world.

08:40.878 --> 08:42.203
Or as we found out later,

08:42.212 --> 08:44.780
what might be about to happen here.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.110
We are sending an armada.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.047
A very powerful armada
is on its way to Korea.

08:52.058 --> 08:54.649
North Korea's getting ready
for another nuclear test,

08:54.659 --> 08:57.318
but it could really happen
any day now, right?

08:57.328 --> 09:00.154
In the event that nuclear
test does go ahead here,

09:00.164 --> 09:02.656
the speculation is that
the US would respond

09:02.666 --> 09:05.092
with some kind of tactical strike

09:05.102 --> 09:06.927
with the aim of knocking out

09:06.937 --> 09:09.363
some of North Korea's
nuclear capabilities,

09:09.373 --> 09:10.931
which potentially could lead

09:10.941 --> 09:13.066
to the most serious military escalation

09:13.076 --> 09:16.444
between the two nations,
in modern times.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.539
As talk mounted of the two countries

09:19.549 --> 09:21.274
potentially coming to blows,

09:21.284 --> 09:24.077
our minders took us to a metro station,

09:24.087 --> 09:26.379
which is where citizens
are instructed to go

09:26.389 --> 09:28.481
in the event of a nuclear attack.

09:28.491 --> 09:31.518
This is one of the deepest
metros in the world.

09:31.528 --> 09:34.554
It goes 150 meters underground,

09:34.564 --> 09:37.790
and apparently doubles
as a bomb shelter.

09:41.271 --> 09:43.229
This allowed us a rare chance

09:43.239 --> 09:45.431
to reach behind the iron curtain

09:45.441 --> 09:46.999
which surrounds North Korea,

09:47.009 --> 09:49.677
and communicate directly
with its citizens.

09:52.314 --> 09:55.141
Is this an exciting week in Pyongyang?

09:55.152 --> 09:59.607
_

09:59.785 --> 10:06.446
_

10:06.666 --> 10:11.549
_

10:11.733 --> 10:14.526
This week there's also escalating
tensions internationally,

10:14.536 --> 10:18.096
especially between DPRK and America.

10:18.106 --> 10:19.630
Are the effects of that felt here?

10:19.640 --> 10:22.341
Is it making any difference
to the celebrations?

10:22.352 --> 10:25.242
_

10:27.397 --> 10:29.897
_

10:31.114 --> 10:33.317
_

10:34.585 --> 10:41.694
_

10:42.554 --> 10:46.324
_

10:47.227 --> 10:49.102
_

10:50.804 --> 10:54.431
This sums up America's
relationship with North Korea.

10:54.441 --> 10:57.534
Each sees the other as an
unrelenting adversary,

10:57.544 --> 10:59.903
since both countries have limited access

10:59.913 --> 11:01.739
to the other's point of view.

11:01.749 --> 11:02.906
The bottom line is

11:02.916 --> 11:04.808
North Korea's got to
change its behavior.

11:04.818 --> 11:08.278
And as the West's hard-lined
rhetoric ramped up,

11:08.288 --> 11:09.846
throughout the night, we could see

11:09.856 --> 11:12.449
the mass mobilization
of military vehicles,

11:12.459 --> 11:15.017
preparing for their
annual show of force.

11:15.027 --> 11:18.722
The Day of the Sun celebration
commemorates the birthday

11:18.732 --> 11:22.459
of North Korea's eternal
president, Kim Il-sung.

11:22.469 --> 11:24.394
It also gives them the opportunity

11:24.404 --> 11:27.029
to broadcast their
strength over the airwaves

11:27.039 --> 11:30.499
with a public military parade.

11:55.967 --> 11:58.126
So, I'm having a complete
sensory overload.

11:58.136 --> 12:00.561
I don't know whether to laugh or cry

12:00.571 --> 12:02.772
or be scared or entertained.

12:27.965 --> 12:30.458
Like Stalin's Soviet marches,

12:30.468 --> 12:32.793
the parade was a jaw-dropping display

12:32.803 --> 12:35.704
of highly choreographed military might.

12:37.241 --> 12:40.367
And much like those May
Day parades of the past,

12:40.377 --> 12:44.471
this show of force was
aimed directly at the US

12:44.481 --> 12:47.049
_

12:47.256 --> 12:50.948
_

12:51.813 --> 12:55.568
_

12:56.334 --> 12:59.052
_

13:01.269 --> 13:03.886
_

13:04.842 --> 13:06.975
_

13:18.647 --> 13:21.440
I believe we're watching
the first display

13:21.450 --> 13:23.809
of North Korea's first-ever ICBMs

13:23.819 --> 13:26.052
that are capable of reaching America.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.453
As the senior politician
just claimed in his speech,

13:34.463 --> 13:36.355
they will launch if provoked.

13:36.365 --> 13:39.557
The North's claims to
have this capability

13:39.567 --> 13:41.459
are disputed by experts.

13:41.469 --> 13:44.596
But there is no doubting
the nationalist fervor

13:44.606 --> 13:47.565
that unveiling missiles helps incite.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.943
The parade kicked off
a dramatic escalation.

13:58.953 --> 14:02.013
The following day,
the North conducted a failed,

14:02.023 --> 14:04.115
though very real, missile test.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.183
... following North
Korea's show of force,

14:06.193 --> 14:08.019
failing in spectacular fashion.

14:08.029 --> 14:10.187
Then, US Vice President Mike Pence

14:10.197 --> 14:13.057
made a surprise visit to
the demilitarized zone

14:13.067 --> 14:15.026
between North and South Korea.

14:15.036 --> 14:17.461
We stand with the people of South Korea,

14:17.471 --> 14:20.364
um, and all options are on the table.

14:20.374 --> 14:21.698
And since then,

14:21.708 --> 14:23.867
amidst increasingly bellicose rhetoric

14:23.877 --> 14:26.003
on President Trump's Twitter feed,

14:26.013 --> 14:28.539
yet more missile tests.

14:28.549 --> 14:32.208
While the Western media was quick
to pounce on their launch failures,

14:32.218 --> 14:34.277
only a short time later,

14:34.287 --> 14:36.179
they successfully tested a missile

14:36.189 --> 14:38.757
that experts believe
could strike the US.

14:40.126 --> 14:42.085
Concrete proof that their technology

14:42.095 --> 14:44.154
is years ahead of expectations,

14:44.164 --> 14:46.056
has triggered an even stronger reaction

14:46.066 --> 14:47.590
from the Trump administration.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.659
As far as North Korea is concerned,

14:49.669 --> 14:51.527
I have some pretty severe things

14:51.537 --> 14:52.963
that we're thinking about.

14:52.973 --> 14:54.897
Make no mistake,

14:54.907 --> 14:57.667
North Korea's launch of an ICBM

14:57.677 --> 15:01.370
is a clear and sharp
military escalation.

15:01.380 --> 15:03.439
We had witnessed firsthand

15:03.449 --> 15:06.742
how echo chambers,
without direct dialogue,

15:06.752 --> 15:09.679
can help beat the drum to war.

15:09.689 --> 15:11.681
We will defeat any attack,

15:11.691 --> 15:13.516
and we will meet any use

15:13.526 --> 15:15.651
of conventional or nuclear weapons

15:15.661 --> 15:18.420
with an overwhelming
and effective response.

15:18.430 --> 15:20.255
The question now

15:20.265 --> 15:22.958
is how far are both sides willing to go

15:22.968 --> 15:24.493
before a war of words

15:24.503 --> 15:26.761
becomes something much more dangerous?

15:36.748 --> 15:40.274
By most definitions,
Somalia is a failed state.

15:40.284 --> 15:43.077
It's been ravaged by famine, civil war,

15:43.087 --> 15:45.013
and become a base for piracy.

15:45.023 --> 15:47.716
Most recently,
it's seen horrendous violence

15:47.726 --> 15:49.884
by the terrorist group Al-Shabaab.

15:49.894 --> 15:52.620
More than two million Somalis have fled

15:52.630 --> 15:53.954
because of those factors,

15:53.964 --> 15:57.191
including 150,000 who came to the US.

15:57.201 --> 15:59.460
But today, many of these émigrés

15:59.470 --> 16:01.162
are starting to return to Somalia

16:01.172 --> 16:03.531
to try to fix their country for good.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.971
Somalia hasn't had a
functioning government

16:10.981 --> 16:12.606
in more than 25 years.

16:12.616 --> 16:15.009
They've been plagued by
decades of civil war

16:15.019 --> 16:16.443
and widespread terrorism.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.747
Billions of dollars of international
support hasn't worked.

16:19.757 --> 16:22.982
But today, there's a new source of hope:

16:22.992 --> 16:24.751
the Somali diaspora.

16:24.761 --> 16:27.054
Thousands of Somali
Westerners are returning.

16:27.064 --> 16:30.657
Unlike foreigners, they have an
inherent commitment to this country,

16:30.667 --> 16:33.293
and their Western education
and work experience

16:33.303 --> 16:35.562
is unparalleled in the region.

16:35.572 --> 16:37.497
We traveled to Southern Somalia,

16:37.507 --> 16:39.799
devastated by severe drought,

16:39.809 --> 16:41.968
where Somali-Canadian doctor, Hodan Ali,

16:41.978 --> 16:44.871
is overseeing a medical
assessment and aid delivery.

16:44.881 --> 16:47.840
We have a shipment brought by UNICEF,

16:47.850 --> 16:49.976
and they have brought supplies

16:49.986 --> 16:52.946
to deal with the acute outbreak

16:52.956 --> 16:54.614
of watery diarrhea.

16:54.624 --> 16:57.649
Because the town is completely
surrounded by Al-Shabaab,

16:57.659 --> 16:59.693
all aid has to be flown in.

17:01.930 --> 17:04.823
This is the community treatment center

17:04.833 --> 17:07.726
for, um, acute watery diarrhea,

17:07.736 --> 17:10.865
one of two facilities
in the entire region.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.335
_

17:12.483 --> 17:14.351
_

17:14.541 --> 17:16.237
_

17:16.679 --> 17:19.031
_

17:19.041 --> 17:20.347
_

17:20.667 --> 17:21.723
_

17:22.584 --> 17:24.609
We left Somalia pre-civil war.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.377
I have been blessed and privileged

17:26.387 --> 17:28.346
to have lived the life that I've lived,

17:28.356 --> 17:30.515
because we're talking about a society

17:30.525 --> 17:32.383
that has not had formal education,

17:32.393 --> 17:34.719
formal institutions, for over 25 years.

17:34.729 --> 17:38.189
We have generations that
have seen nothing but war.

17:38.199 --> 17:40.024
What we need now is investment,

17:40.034 --> 17:41.826
human investment, human resources,

17:41.836 --> 17:45.730
because we cannot depend on
international interventions.

17:45.740 --> 17:47.197
Who... who is going to do it,

17:47.207 --> 17:49.634
if people like myself don't do it?

17:49.644 --> 17:51.135
Somalia's still a dangerous place.

17:51.145 --> 17:54.204
There were several explosions
just in the last few days.

17:54.214 --> 17:57.041
Why leave a comfortable,
safe life in Canada?

17:57.051 --> 17:59.510
Somalia is definitely a dangerous place,

17:59.520 --> 18:01.911
but I don't look at the danger.

18:01.921 --> 18:04.080
I look at the potential and the need

18:04.090 --> 18:05.649
that the country has.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.286
After filming for just over an hour,

18:09.296 --> 18:11.655
local Intel came in that Al-Shabaab,

18:11.665 --> 18:14.291
known for targeting and
executing Westerners,

18:14.301 --> 18:15.624
wasn't far away.

18:15.635 --> 18:17.694
Apparently Al-Shabaab got
word that we're here,

18:17.704 --> 18:19.328
and that aid just came into the town,

18:19.338 --> 18:21.064
so we got to get out of here.

18:24.301 --> 18:26.736
While Dr. Hodan's work in
the most desperate parts

18:26.746 --> 18:28.337
of Somalia has been crucial,

18:28.347 --> 18:29.973
back in Mogadishu,

18:29.983 --> 18:32.709
she's attempting to build
Somalia's health care system

18:32.719 --> 18:34.343
from the ground up.

18:34.353 --> 18:39.081
Dr. Hodan just opened this
beautiful health center.

18:39.091 --> 18:40.957
It's definitely an upgrade.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.053
The facility really is a facility

18:44.063 --> 18:46.955
for first... um, primary care services.

18:46.965 --> 18:48.257
Preventative care,

18:48.267 --> 18:50.293
chronic illnesses like
diabetes, hypertension,

18:50.303 --> 18:52.494
which is really,
really on the rise here.

18:52.504 --> 18:55.463
See, this bed here is a maternity bed,

18:55.473 --> 18:59.201
but if you go to your
average clinic or hospital,

18:59.211 --> 19:01.003
women don't have this type of bed.

19:01.013 --> 19:03.405
The number one killer of Somali women

19:03.415 --> 19:05.407
is postpartum hemorrhage.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.275
A woman is about to go into labor,

19:07.285 --> 19:09.257
they pray for her, for her return.

19:09.268 --> 19:11.595
Because they know that's the
deadliest thing she could do.

19:11.606 --> 19:12.814
Absolutely.

19:12.824 --> 19:15.183
Now we're gonna go upstairs.

19:15.193 --> 19:18.687
We have our quick
inpatient facility here

19:18.697 --> 19:21.889
for folks who need
immediate rehydration.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.291
Every room has a sink,

19:24.301 --> 19:27.061
and we will be putting antiseptic soaps

19:27.071 --> 19:30.664
and all the means to make sure that
people are cleaning their hands.

19:30.674 --> 19:32.867
So, that seems pretty standard.

19:32.877 --> 19:34.736
- You know, basic sanitation.
- Yes.

19:34.746 --> 19:37.404
- How rare is it here?
- Very rare.

19:37.414 --> 19:40.374
People who have come here have said,
"You know, this is different."

19:40.384 --> 19:42.610
And that's the idea.
It needs to be different.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.946
Not different that it is crazy,
out-of-this-world.

19:45.956 --> 19:49.149
It's just basic services
that I would be providing

19:49.159 --> 19:51.652
in... in Hamilton, Ontario, right?

19:51.662 --> 19:53.420
Because at the end of the day,

19:53.430 --> 19:57.423
it's... it's a place
that anything you do...

19:57.433 --> 19:59.592
makes a difference.

19:59.602 --> 20:02.629
But for a country with a
bloody history, like Somalia,

20:02.639 --> 20:04.798
the first pillar to
restoring the country

20:04.808 --> 20:06.800
is providing security.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.568
We joined the Somali National Army

20:08.578 --> 20:10.837
and AMISOM, the African
peacekeeping force,

20:10.847 --> 20:13.373
widely credited with
stabilizing the country,

20:13.383 --> 20:15.937
as they visited a
recently opened school.

20:19.422 --> 20:21.381
Twenty-five years of anarchy,

20:21.391 --> 20:24.150
we're not going to have
it solved overnight,

20:24.160 --> 20:26.252
but with our partners from Africa,

20:26.262 --> 20:27.987
the AMISOM, we've tried our best,

20:27.997 --> 20:29.522
and I think you can see the results.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.390
Did you live in the UK? Yes.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.725
I hear that accent.
You're a diaspora, huh?

20:33.735 --> 20:36.195
- Yes.
- Wow. Why did you return?

20:36.205 --> 20:37.830
To serve my country.

20:40.642 --> 20:42.134
Before AMISOM took over

20:42.144 --> 20:45.104
for the dysfunctional Somali
National Army in 2007,

20:45.114 --> 20:47.506
Al-Shabaab controlled most of Mogadishu

20:47.516 --> 20:48.973
and much of the country.

20:48.983 --> 20:51.075
Today, they're much weaker

20:51.085 --> 20:52.952
and rely on one-off attacks.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.648
During the Battle of Mogadishu in 2011,

20:56.658 --> 20:58.784
AMISOM and the SNA
fought with Al-Shabaab

20:58.794 --> 21:01.653
for control over a significant
national landmark,

21:01.663 --> 21:04.488
the Mogadishu football stadium.

21:04.498 --> 21:06.490
So, Al-Shabaab used to control

21:06.500 --> 21:08.326
this whole stadium, this whole area,

21:08.336 --> 21:11.196
and it was a big win for AMISOM

21:11.206 --> 21:12.504
when they took it back.

21:13.441 --> 21:14.699
_

21:14.710 --> 21:16.528
_

21:16.721 --> 21:19.057
_

21:19.068 --> 21:21.024
_

21:21.035 --> 21:22.508
_

21:23.071 --> 21:25.141
_

21:25.419 --> 21:28.479
The UPDF forces were the
first contingent to come.

21:28.489 --> 21:30.147
The UPDF were also, at the time,

21:30.157 --> 21:31.549
at a placed called Uruba.

21:31.559 --> 21:32.583
That's the Uruba Hotel.

21:32.593 --> 21:35.720
So, you now control all
of this and way beyond?

21:35.730 --> 21:37.354
We are beyond this.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.522
If Somalia was a no-go zone,

21:39.532 --> 21:41.391
uh, a few years back,

21:41.401 --> 21:43.526
today it's open, it's a normal country,

21:43.536 --> 21:45.262
and slowly we are progressing.

21:45.272 --> 21:46.463
The last ten years

21:46.473 --> 21:50.133
have been years of
progress for this country.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.631
The businesses and construction

21:51.642 --> 21:52.902
popping up throughout the city

21:52.912 --> 21:55.772
were encouraging signs of
the country rebuilding.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.975
One very busy, unexpected
storefront caught our eye.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.244
This street here is regularly bombed,

22:01.254 --> 22:03.813
but it turns out there
is a juice shop open.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.069
This is some of the most extreme
gentrification I've ever seen.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.752
- Welcome.
- I like your sunglasses.

22:08.763 --> 22:11.106
- All right. Thank you.
- You guys got good vibes in here.

22:11.117 --> 22:12.746
Where I came from, the US,

22:12.785 --> 22:15.191
where this kind of shop
actually was very popular.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.360
Maybe I should try something like that,

22:17.370 --> 22:19.495
and immediately it became a hit.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.797
About 300 or 400 customers

22:21.807 --> 22:23.532
visit this store every day.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.767
- Wow.
- Yeah.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.603
We know there's electronic
shops that actually do good.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.237
There's a lot of travel agencies.

22:29.247 --> 22:32.374
There's also a fashion shop
here called "Cadaani."

22:32.384 --> 22:33.876
They want change, and that's actually

22:33.886 --> 22:36.144
what we want to try to show
off to Mogadishu people,

22:36.154 --> 22:38.346
that this is also a relatively safe city

22:38.356 --> 22:41.316
where you can do business.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.452
"Safety" is still a relative
term here in Mogadishu,

22:44.462 --> 22:45.820
but the returning diaspora

22:45.830 --> 22:47.989
that is fueling much of
the economic growth here

22:47.999 --> 22:50.458
are determined to succeed.

22:50.468 --> 22:52.860
Like Ahmed Jama,
who returned from the UK

22:52.870 --> 22:54.529
to open the Village Restaurant,

22:54.539 --> 22:57.098
a popular spot among Somali Westerners.

22:57.108 --> 22:59.742
_

22:59.753 --> 23:01.943
_

23:04.014 --> 23:06.441
Ahmed's restaurants have
been attacked several times

23:06.451 --> 23:08.709
by suicide bombers, active shooters,

23:08.719 --> 23:10.812
and vehicle-borne IEDs.

23:10.822 --> 23:13.147
But each time, he's reopened.

23:13.157 --> 23:16.016
How do you stay safe when you're
running restaurants like this?

23:16.026 --> 23:19.494
_

23:19.505 --> 23:21.668
_

23:21.679 --> 23:23.054
Right.

23:23.065 --> 23:25.734
_

23:26.156 --> 23:28.109
_

23:29.027 --> 23:30.082
How's it going?

23:30.116 --> 23:35.299
_

23:36.262 --> 23:39.628
_

23:40.152 --> 23:41.925
_

23:41.936 --> 23:43.354
_

23:43.365 --> 23:45.244
_

23:45.255 --> 23:46.385
_

23:46.723 --> 23:50.992
Why is it important to open
restaurants in a city like Mogadishu?

23:59.702 --> 24:00.834
Yeah.

24:08.711 --> 24:10.202
One of the most pressing needs

24:10.212 --> 24:13.071
in a country decimated
by decades of civil war

24:13.081 --> 24:14.773
is infrastructure.

24:14.783 --> 24:16.809
We met up with a
Somali-American engineer

24:16.819 --> 24:19.077
who offered to show us his new project,

24:19.087 --> 24:20.746
a million-dollar investment.

24:20.756 --> 24:23.281
Gianna. Nice to meet you.

24:23.291 --> 24:26.159
Good! This does not look
like the rest of Mogadishu.

24:27.195 --> 24:29.121
It feels like California.

24:29.131 --> 24:31.756
You have butterflies in your garden.

24:31.766 --> 24:34.467
Sell me one of these apartments.
Tell me why I should move here.

24:35.437 --> 24:36.736
Sure.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.367
Very nice.

24:43.377 --> 24:44.844
So much natural light.

24:46.581 --> 24:48.213
How many bedrooms, you said?

24:51.786 --> 24:53.144
Wow, look at this.

24:53.154 --> 24:55.479
You got the balcony and everything.

24:55.489 --> 24:59.450
So, I gotta say, on this side,
it's amazing. You can see the ocean.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.896
But the foreground is all
bombed-out buildings.

25:01.907 --> 25:03.880
_

25:04.131 --> 25:05.189
Yeah.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.458
We asked Osman if financial opportunity

25:07.468 --> 25:09.793
has factored into his
decision to move back.

25:09.803 --> 25:12.003
Do you think you'd be making
the same amount of money?

25:12.560 --> 25:13.779
_

25:14.043 --> 25:15.060
_

25:15.071 --> 25:17.005
_

25:17.593 --> 25:19.225
Oh, so you don't pay taxes?

25:19.236 --> 25:20.925
_

25:20.936 --> 25:22.950
_

25:22.961 --> 25:24.662
_

25:24.673 --> 25:27.355
_

25:27.366 --> 25:29.242
_

25:29.253 --> 25:31.403
_

25:31.414 --> 25:33.020
_

25:34.227 --> 25:35.651
Diaspora are building up,

25:35.661 --> 25:38.721
and now for the first time
in more than 25 years,

25:38.731 --> 25:41.091
they're creating a
functioning government.

25:41.101 --> 25:42.725
In February, the parliament elected

25:42.735 --> 25:44.694
a Somali-American as president,

25:44.704 --> 25:46.128
in a historic vote.

25:46.138 --> 25:47.494
We visited Villa Somalia,

25:47.505 --> 25:48.983
their version of the White House,

25:48.994 --> 25:51.968
as the president announced
the 26 new ministers.

25:51.978 --> 25:55.587
_

25:55.892 --> 25:58.619
_

25:59.275 --> 26:01.243
_

26:01.830 --> 26:06.101
_

26:06.429 --> 26:07.937
_

26:11.850 --> 26:14.134
Sir? Hello, I'm Gianna.

26:14.145 --> 26:16.666
_

26:16.881 --> 26:18.568
_

26:19.090 --> 26:21.562
Uh, national security. Congratulations.

26:21.572 --> 26:22.806
Can I ask, are you a diaspora?

26:22.817 --> 26:23.854
_

26:23.865 --> 26:25.549
You are. From where?

26:25.560 --> 26:27.401
- My name is Abdi.
- Abdi?

26:27.411 --> 26:29.679
Which... what were you just appointed?

26:30.135 --> 26:32.448
_

26:32.784 --> 26:34.375
Okay. Congratulations.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.786
Can I ask, are you a diaspora?

26:35.797 --> 26:37.316
_

26:37.327 --> 26:39.219
- The United States?
- I lived in Washington.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.814
Eighty percent of the ministers

26:40.824 --> 26:42.650
appointed here are diaspora

26:42.660 --> 26:44.952
and their presence is
giving people hope.

26:44.962 --> 26:46.720
But this shift toward Westernization

26:46.731 --> 26:49.533
triggered Al-Shabaab's string
of attacks soon after.

26:50.668 --> 26:52.726
About an hour after we
left Villa Somalia,

26:52.736 --> 26:54.695
a bomb exploded at the front gates,

26:54.705 --> 26:56.063
killing several people,

26:56.073 --> 26:58.732
and many more went off in the
capital while we were there.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.301
In what was meant to be an
attack against Al-Shabaab,

27:01.311 --> 27:04.705
one of the ministers we met,
Abas Abdullahi Sheikh,

27:04.715 --> 27:06.906
was shot and killed by security forces

27:06.916 --> 27:08.708
shortly after we left the country.

27:08.718 --> 27:10.310
But despite these attacks,

27:10.320 --> 27:13.046
the diaspora have become
a formidable force

27:13.056 --> 27:16.216
pushing back against extremism.

27:16.226 --> 27:17.850
Part of what has fueled Al-Shabaab,

27:17.860 --> 27:20.487
which translates to
"the youth" in Arabic,

27:20.497 --> 27:23.489
is their ability to win the
hearts and minds of young people.

27:23.499 --> 27:25.124
Elman Peace and Human Rights Centre

27:25.134 --> 27:28.427
is an organization that
rehabilitates radicalized children,

27:28.437 --> 27:30.930
aiming to end the cycle of violence.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.281
_

27:32.292 --> 27:34.039
_

27:34.050 --> 27:36.302
_

27:37.199 --> 27:38.769
_

27:39.466 --> 27:40.615
_

27:41.034 --> 27:44.109
Ilwad Elman is a
27-year-old Somali-Canadian

27:44.119 --> 27:45.944
who left her safe life in Ottawa

27:45.954 --> 27:49.281
to deradicalize Al-Shabaab
child soldiers.

27:49.291 --> 27:52.451
These safe houses,
these are for children

27:52.461 --> 27:53.619
that are still under threat.

27:53.629 --> 27:57.122
Children that have been forcibly
recruited into Al-Shabaab,

27:57.132 --> 27:59.157
managed to escape,

27:59.167 --> 28:02.928
were then put into detention for being
forcibly recruited into Al-Shabaab,

28:02.938 --> 28:06.464
and then used by government
security forces as informants.

28:06.474 --> 28:09.801
But we believe that children
can become children again

28:09.811 --> 28:13.037
if they are taken out of
these militarized contexts.

28:13.047 --> 28:14.071
Mm-hmm.

28:14.081 --> 28:17.975
And I've seen that hundreds
of times over again.

28:17.985 --> 28:20.177
Ilwad does extremely dangerous work

28:20.187 --> 28:23.313
and is the boldest example
of diaspora coming back.

28:23.323 --> 28:25.816
In fact, her father paid with his life

28:25.826 --> 28:27.651
for doing the same type of work.

28:27.661 --> 28:29.887
So, my dad and my mom were both...

28:29.897 --> 28:31.421
ardent human rights activists.

28:31.431 --> 28:34.891
And... when the war started to escalate,

28:34.901 --> 28:37.561
my mom and dad made a
decision that she would leave

28:37.571 --> 28:40.297
with me and my sisters,
and my dad would stay behind.

28:40.307 --> 28:43.433
I went back, just to understand
what the context was like,

28:43.443 --> 28:46.169
and as soon as I did,
one month turned to three months,

28:46.179 --> 28:48.838
turned to one year,
and now I'm here for seven years.

28:53.653 --> 28:55.245
In order to rebuild,

28:55.255 --> 28:58.314
there needs to be an investment

28:58.324 --> 29:00.049
in the young people.

29:00.059 --> 29:01.651
By investing in young people,

29:01.661 --> 29:03.920
we will not have...

29:03.930 --> 29:05.221
hundreds of people taking on

29:05.231 --> 29:06.922
the Mediterranean Sea every single year,

29:06.932 --> 29:08.491
trying to think that the only way

29:08.501 --> 29:10.526
for a good life is outside of Somalia.

29:10.536 --> 29:13.329
I want to show them the
opportunities that are here.

29:13.339 --> 29:16.507
And it just starts with
actually giving someone hope.
