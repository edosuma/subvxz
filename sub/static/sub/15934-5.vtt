00:11.840 --> 00:16.391
Roche, do you need
your passport to go Ipswich?

00:13.760 --> 00:15.478
Only if you're going
via France.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.109
Right.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.879
I'll double check with Chabuds,

00:18.160 --> 00:19.513
might need it
for the tolls up North.

00:19.840 --> 00:20.829
Okay.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.553
You know, this is our
first out of town gig.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.470
And it's my first gig
as their manager

00:28.160 --> 00:30.879
so I need to prove that I'm...

00:29.320 --> 00:30.275
Hold on.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.149
I need to prove that I'm...

00:35.840 --> 00:37.671
worth it. (CHUCKLES)

00:37.960 --> 00:39.871
But no, in all seriousness,
like,

00:40.280 --> 00:42.396
the boys have put
their trust in me

00:42.400 --> 00:43.515
and I can't let them down.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.836
DJ BEATS: <i>We basically couldn't be</i>
<i>fucked to sort it all out,</i>

00:46.600 --> 00:48.272
<i>so we just let Chabuds</i>
<i>do it really.</i>

00:49.320 --> 00:51.834
Yeah, we've got to focus
just on the performance.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.798
It's our first nationwide tour so...

00:52.560 --> 00:53.754
- Spreading the seed.
- Yeah.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.069
Lyrically.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.674
And literally as well, innit?

00:57.560 --> 00:58.515
Yeah.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.393
GRINDAH: Big night. Big night.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.512
Tonight is going to be
quite the test

01:04.319 --> 01:05.958
with all the bloody
groupie action.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.913
Sweet, good to go.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.991
Ah. Only bloody forgot the condoms,
didn't I?

01:16.520 --> 01:17.953
MICHE: <i>Have some breakfast.</i>

01:18.760 --> 01:20.716
INTERVIEWER: <i>So have you</i>
<i>and Grindah broken up?</i>

01:20.320 --> 01:21.639
MICHE:
<i>No, we haven't broken up.</i>

01:22.240 --> 01:23.958
<i>I'm just you know,</i>
<i>giving him some time to think</i>

01:25.040 --> 01:27.634
<i>about what he really wants,</i>
<i>and think about all the things</i>

01:27.560 --> 01:28.879
<i>that he's been</i>
<i>taking for granted.</i>

01:29.320 --> 01:30.878
<i>And in the meantime, you know,</i>
<i>it gives me a chance</i>

01:31.960 --> 01:33.075
to get to know
who Miche really is.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.595
Some Miche time.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.192
- Easy.
- All right.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.079
Oh. You're out of milk, mate.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.673
Is there not enough
left for me?

01:48.440 --> 01:49.839
Nah, I like it really milky.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.754
GRINDAH: <i>You having it dry?</i>

01:54.760 --> 01:55.829
- GRINDAH: <i>I can't wait.</i>
- DJ BEATS: <i>I can't wait. Yeah, same.</i>

01:56.200 --> 01:57.428
- GRINDAH: <i>You excited?</i> (CHUCKLES)
- DJ BEATS: <i>Yeah. Jinx.</i>

01:57.720 --> 01:59.039
(HORN HONKS)

01:59.520 --> 02:00.669
Hold on!

02:01.360 --> 02:02.873
Oh, mate, he's here!

02:02.640 --> 02:03.709
- Come on...
- Come on, let's go!

02:05.960 --> 02:09.077
Bruv! Have you seen this?
It's our very own tour van!

02:08.280 --> 02:10.395
This is the official
Kurupt FM tour bus!

02:10.639 --> 02:12.790
Brother! Smashed it!

02:12.240 --> 02:13.639
I've designated
a driver as well!

02:15.800 --> 02:19.156
So, Deeky, alley-oop, my brother.
Okay? And, boys,

02:20.040 --> 02:24.079
for you I've installed a state
of the art sound system.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.911
- Yes! We love music!
- (DJ BEATS LAUGHS)

02:23.240 --> 02:24.195
DJ BEATS: Customised interior,
as well!

02:24.400 --> 02:25.355
CHABUDDY G: That's why I did it.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.994
INTERVIEWER: <i>How long is the tour</i>
<i>going to be then?</i>

02:27.520 --> 02:29.033
GRINDAH: <i>Put it this way, yeah,</i>

02:30.760 --> 02:33.797
- one leg naturally follows another.
- So is there a second?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.514
There's not a second...
But just...

02:33.560 --> 02:34.675
- So, yeah...
- Loads of shows.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.954
At the moment it's just
one booking, but yeah.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.678
You never know on the way back
from Ipswich...

02:39.360 --> 02:40.395
Might find somewhere.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.073
Look at that!
Personalised window plates!

02:43.880 --> 02:45.233
No, photos 'cause we're famous!

02:46.440 --> 02:48.351
- That's it, fuck off! (LAUGHS)
- I love travelling!

02:48.560 --> 02:50.118
(GRUNTING)

02:50.440 --> 02:52.112
- GRINDAH: What?
- DJ BEATS: That stinks!

02:52.280 --> 02:53.918
GRINDAH: Steves,
have you been sick already?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.395
I've got a delicate system, innit?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.034
Well, if you're gonna be
sick constantly

02:56.120 --> 02:57.189
then get in the back,
I don't wanna see

02:57.480 --> 02:58.435
or smell you. Come on.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.150
- I just got it cleaned, as well.
- Shoot! Out! Get out!

03:01.240 --> 03:02.355
- It's worse in the back for me.
- Just get out.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.553
My job on tour is to:
A, DJ. B, Keep up the vibe.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.118
<i>And C,</i>
<i>Try not to be sick in the car.</i>

03:13.240 --> 03:14.992
INTERVIEWER: <i>How do you think</i>
<i>you'll do on those?</i>

03:16.360 --> 03:19.272
STEVES: <i>Er... Good on the first two,</i>
<i>not so good on the last one.</i>

03:19.280 --> 03:21.999
Get in. See you later, mate.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.353
Comfy as well.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.035
Mate!

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

03:38.800 --> 03:39.949
All right, Miche?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.829
Yeah, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.797
Just, you've been shampooing her hair
for about twenty minutes, so...

03:48.520 --> 03:52.069
Yeah, no, it's just...
she had very dirty hair.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.754
So just getting it cleaned up.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.031
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Have you spoken to Grindah?</i>

03:56.040 --> 03:57.189
No, not yet.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.393
Sometimes the most powerful thing
you can say is nothing at all.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.559
- INTERVIEWER: Is that a quote?
- Yeah.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.594
It's from one of my favourite memes.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.958
GRINDAH:
<i>Mate! Follow that sign!</i>

04:09.240 --> 04:10.832
- DJ BEATS: <i>The North!</i>
- GRINDAH: <i>The North!</i>

04:13.400 --> 04:16.790
This is proper like
we're in the jungle right now.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.154
CHABUDDY G: Look at that,
it's like the bloody Serengeti.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.310
DJ BEATS: This is actually the most
amount of green I've ever seen.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.398
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Are you excited about the tour?</i>

04:22.400 --> 04:23.753
He hasn't stopped
banging on about it, bless him.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.718
Nah, I can't wait to go travelling!

04:25.840 --> 04:27.319
Yeah! First time
leaving the manor and all that,

04:28.040 --> 04:30.031
- it's gonna be sick.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.997
But properly leaving,
like motorway leaving.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.874
Yeah, d'ya know what I mean?

04:33.880 --> 04:35.950
GRINDAH: <i>Hype on the riddim</i>

- I look like him, innit?
- Yeah, that's mad.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.793
Guys, guys, guys,

04:51.280 --> 04:55.068
I've organized a services stop
in t-minus 400 yards.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.395
Hope you're hungry.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.789
- What?! Yes!
- Chabzy!

Yeah?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.592
DJ BEATS: Do you think they've got
different flavour crisps up north?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.034
Only time will tell.

05:22.000 --> 05:22.955

- Thank you.

I'm having them.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.033
Soup. (LAUGHS)

05:36.440 --> 05:39.238
- All right, mate?
- What's that smell?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.598
That's...
I'll clean it up later.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.191
It's fine, I didn't have breakfast,
it's mainly just spit.

05:46.760 --> 05:47.749
Is this Ipswich?

05:49.560 --> 05:52.154
Grindah, they've got a coffee machine

05:51.400 --> 05:53.038
where you can make
your own coffee!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.431
(CHUCKLES) I don't even like coffee

05:55.160 --> 05:56.593
but I'm gonna have one
'cause it looks sick.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.510
- I'm gonna have one as well.
- Yeah have a go.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.715
It's a computer!

06:00.080 --> 06:01.274
- Yeah, I know.
- Has it got Wi-Fi?

06:02.760 --> 06:03.715
It's an iPad.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.558
Watch it go. Watch it go.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.193
- It's loading.
- Watch it go.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.797
GRINDAH: What?
It's coming out the computer!

06:12.880 --> 06:14.632
- Ah, mate!
- (CHUCKLES)

06:14.520 --> 06:15.953
Get a close up of that,
that's fucking mental.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.995
DJ BEATS: That is sick.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.153
(GROANS) Hey, Deeky.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.596
We're like twins, you know that?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.352
Go on, what am I thinking
right now?

06:24.760 --> 06:25.715
Dunno.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.557
I was thinking how great it is

06:32.760 --> 06:34.671
that we are going on our
first lads holiday together.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.152
Hey! Hands up! (CHUCKLES)

06:39.960 --> 06:41.359
That was a joke, man. Banter.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.278
Chabuds!
You gotta go pay, mate.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.836
Yeah, you lot stay
in the budget and that?

06:46.360 --> 06:48.191
Yeah, go and pay
they're waiting for ya.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.755
(LAUGHS) Bare munch!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.389
I'll pay! Calm down, how much is it?

06:57.920 --> 07:00.639
It's forty-three pounds for that
and twenty pound for the petrol.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.918
(SCOFFS) Forty-three pound?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.832
You know it can be expensive
being a manager.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.271
You know what I mean?
There's loads of expenses

07:08.120 --> 07:10.759
and you do need to front the
all the cash for your artistes,

07:09.640 --> 07:10.959
you know, and I'm willing to do that

07:11.440 --> 07:13.032
because I know that it's going
to come back tenfold.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.194
You know what I mean?

07:14.360 --> 07:15.588
You like gold?

07:15.760 --> 07:16.954
I need cash, man.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.875
You pay the forty-three pounds.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.035
Melt this down.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.718
Whilst they're making
the number one hits,

07:21.600 --> 07:22.999
I'm gonna be the one
who's laughing.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.833
You know what I mean?
Fifteen percent, baby.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.393
Simon Cowell. Puff Daddy.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.034
I'm a mogul.
That's what moguls do.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.471
Give me the cash,
this is not Marrakech, man.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.869
This is a petrol pump, man.
Give me the other five. Come on.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.714
Bloody Asian people.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.274
Boys, that was a bit
over budget, yeah,

07:42.160 --> 07:43.115
be careful next time.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.832
GRINDAH: No, worries, mate, come on.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.473
DJ BEATS: That's disgusting.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.233
GRINDAH: (GROANS)
Get that away from me.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.832
The crisps are ribbed
for pleasure.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.951
GRINDAH: Kurupt Boys
are going global, mate.

08:01.880 --> 08:02.835
DJ BEATS: <i>Going up north.</i>

08:03.440 --> 08:04.395
What the fuck?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.475
Where... Have they gone?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.071
- Right, Miche.
- Yeah?

08:15.840 --> 08:18.229
We've decided we're taking you
out tonight for drinks tonight.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.392
- Me and the girls.
- Oh, my God! Really?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.155
- My first ever work drinks!
- Yeah!

08:22.520 --> 08:25.080
Oh, my God. Amazing!

08:24.120 --> 08:25.519
Are we gonna go straight
from here?

08:25.520 --> 08:26.714
'Cause I'm just thinking,

08:27.400 --> 08:29.072
I could get my mum to drop off
my outfit.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.718
I could jump on the sunbed
for a bit...

08:30.480 --> 08:31.595
Yeah, don't worry
about it too much.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.874
- It's just drinks.
- Yeah, no, course. It's fine.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.948
Work drinks!

08:37.120 --> 08:39.236
I literally can't believe it,
I've never been before.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.958
Just local drinks. It will be nice
though, won't it, girls?

08:42.159 --> 08:44.913

Another drink?

Yeah, bus drink!

Are you getting me drunk, Tanya?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.676
- No, the opposite. The opposite.
- Ah!

17:40.880 --> 17:42.916
I can hear you.
That's really loud. Okay.

Let's have a little dance, Tanya.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.669
Wiggle those hips! Ah...

17:52.800 --> 17:54.028
I kinda wish it did kick off
in there actually.

17:53.960 --> 17:54.915
Because,
what I would have done,

17:56.680 --> 17:59.194
I would have stunned him.
One, one, two, two.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.757
Whack, straight over the head,
and he would have been out.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.435
What's happening
with the groupies?

18:07.760 --> 18:08.829
You said it was gonna
pick up in a bit.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.757
Sorry, I know it's been
a bit of a weird one.

I was told that Kurupt FM
were going to sell out the venue,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.036
but there's no-one here, there's no
money in the till so I can't...

You didn't market it right, mate!

19:16.440 --> 19:19.910
I tell you what, mate,
you're brown listed. Idiot.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.631
Listen, mate,
I got some bad news, all right,

19:21.600 --> 19:24.353
basically the promoter
didn't make enough money

19:24.240 --> 19:26.674
to pay us the fee, okay,
so he's going to pay us

19:25.960 --> 19:27.473
as soon as his student loan
comes through.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.949
No, bruv, this whole
fucking thing is a joke, bruv.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.910
If I don't get my money now,
I'm gonna go fucking schiz.

You're not meant to ask that!

19:58.920 --> 20:00.672
Yeah, but I want a picture
with a groupie as well.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.588
I'm not a groupie.

so get tight, get cosy.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.553
I might just go
and sleep in the van

21:48.160 --> 21:49.991
'cause there ain't
enough space in here.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.669

innit?

I was just gonna say,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.754
probably best that you sleep
in the bath actually,

22:11.560 --> 22:14.154
just in case you piss yourself.
Easier.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.555

- Okay, perfect.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.359

Yeah, let me just
check the other side, yeah.

- But it was really nice to meet you.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.315
What? I've got a zoot,
you might as well, share it.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.239

STEVES:
I always have a zoot before bed.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.596
Probably just a false alarm
anyway.

No, worries,
maybe another night

24:51.200 --> 24:52.155
when the fire alarm
didn't go off.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.870
- Yeah, probably not.
- (LAUGHS) Bye.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.555
See ya later!

that I almost had
a threesome tonight.

- Is it?
- Yeah.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.195
Where have they gone?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.668

Nothing's wrong.

Yes, Angel. Don't be clever.

my own bed now, though.

How long do you think
it will be till...

26:49.640 --> 26:51.278
Miche sort of lets you back in?

26:51.400 --> 26:52.958
I might not take her back, mate.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.511
Especially with the bloody
groupie action popping off.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.074

27:06.520 --> 27:07.635
Here, watch this.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.519
(SCREAMING)

27:09.560 --> 27:10.709
We're crashing!

27:11.200 --> 27:12.633
(LAUGHING)

27:12.400 --> 27:13.389
You idiot.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.750
His face.
He thought he was gonna die.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.470
(LAUGHING)

27:40.160 --> 27:41.878
Fuck it.
He'll make his own way back.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.275
He always does, innit?

27:43.240 --> 27:44.958
Decoy, tomorrow, yeah?

27:44.640 --> 27:45.834
(YAWNS) Laters, man.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.073
I'll hit you up on MSN, yeah, Deeky?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.388
Do you maybe just
wanna pop yourself

27:53.600 --> 27:54.828
into the treatment room,

27:55.400 --> 27:56.992
because, I don't want you to be
sick in front of the customers.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.515
Yeah?

27:59.040 --> 28:01.315
Roche, I'm home.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.794
ROCHE: Hello.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.912
DJ BEATS: <i>Sometimes you've gotta</i>
<i>switch the pace up.</i>

28:05.000 --> 28:07.468
Get out your comfort zone,
go travelling,

28:07.880 --> 28:10.553
because you'll come back
a better man.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.229
How was it?

28:11.160 --> 28:12.957
- Yeah, pretty draining.
- Was it?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.996
Yeah, my eyes are sore,
think I got jetlag.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.154
We went Ipswich.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.874
And it was shit, but it was
a test of our character.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.114
(SIGHS) Different bed every night.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.396
All part of the rock star lifestyle,
innit?

28:28.320 --> 28:30.993
DJ BEATS: <i>And that's what</i>
<i>life about, mate, enjoy it,</i>

28:31.240 --> 28:32.275
<i>even the shit moments.</i>

29:10.960 --> 29:12.234
Or it'll just
make you depressed.
