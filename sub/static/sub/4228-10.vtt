(TRAIN HORN BLARING)

00:08.759 --> 00:11.929
You know what I like the most
about Chicago?

00:12.054 --> 00:14.098
- What's that, bro?
- The pizza.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.976
Say what you want
about New York, all right?

00:17.184 --> 00:19.145
But that town ain't got nothing
on the Windy City

00:19.311 --> 00:20.896
when it comes to pizza pie.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.023
That's another reason why we

00:22.189 --> 00:23.858
should hate those
Overlord bastards.

00:24.025 --> 00:27.945
About 20 miles or so to go.
So far, no alien resistance.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.447
WEAVER:
They'll be there waiting for us.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.614
ANTHONY: Yes, sir.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.450
Well, letâ€™s just hope
that Mason and his team

00:32.616 --> 00:35.578
can figure out how to fire
that big-ass alien popgun.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.420
When you get used
to the symbology,

00:44.587 --> 00:47.757
the Volm language
is actually quite intuitive.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.467
It's almost elegant.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.676
Hmm.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.511
Unfortunately, it is a tongue

00:52.720 --> 00:55.431
designed for pragmatism,
not poetry.

00:55.598 --> 00:56.599
(DOOR OPENS)

00:57.475 --> 00:58.476
How's it coming?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.352
All the systems
seem to be checking out.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.854
So this thing's gonna work?

01:02.021 --> 01:03.314
Almost certainly.

01:03.481 --> 01:05.566
Not a lot of room
for "almost" here, Doctor.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.944
By "almost,"
I'm estimating a 94% probability

01:09.153 --> 01:10.613
that the weapon will function
as expected.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.532
Good. Any contact
with the Volm ship?

01:13.699 --> 01:15.493
COCHISE: No, but I did not
expect we would.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.994
They're gonna be there, though?

01:17.328 --> 01:19.705
They will see the heat signature
when we destroy the tower.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.458
That will act as
a navigational beacon of sorts.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.460
I know we've gone over this
a dozen times. It's just...

01:24.627 --> 01:27.379
The entire fate of your planet
and mankind are at stake?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.340
Yeah. Something like that.

01:30.341 --> 01:32.927
Everything will be fine,
my friend.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.346
In this you must have faith.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.599
I do. Thank you.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.729
Unh.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.231

01:45.397 --> 01:47.024
Maybe I should hold that.

(WHISTLES)

01:49.360 --> 01:50.611
Is this gonna work, Colonel?

01:51.362 --> 01:52.363
The plan, I mean.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.781
It has to.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.866
Copy that, sir.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.245
But did we do the right thing
bringing her?

01:59.954 --> 02:01.413

02:02.915 --> 02:05.543

I certainly hope so.

are the bait for Karen.</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:31.360
Hard to believe.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.570
What's that?

02:32.945 --> 02:34.947
War is coming to an end.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.615
- An end?
- Yeah.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.993
I'm not sure I see that.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.995
If that Volm weapon works,

02:41.162 --> 02:42.872
the grid comes down,
and the Volm land,

02:43.247 --> 02:45.583
I don't think this war's
gonna last much longer.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.422
Well, you know what they say
it ain't over till it's over.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.508
I know. Still...

02:56.302 --> 02:58.179
What?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.556
I've just been thinking
about afterwards, you know?

03:00.723 --> 03:05.769
Like, settling back into a life,
real life.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.688
- A real life?
- Yeah.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.440
What's that look like?

03:10.441 --> 03:11.817
It's nothing fancy.

03:12.026 --> 03:15.571
A comfortable house,
good-sized backyard.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.323
Oh, my God.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.534
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.829
Wow. I mean...

03:25.414 --> 03:26.498
Wow.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.293
What about you?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.003
You're telling me you haven't
given a single thought

03:31.170 --> 03:32.296
as to what you're gonna do
after the war?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.381
Uh... No.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.468
All I figured out
is I'm pretty good at fighting.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.970
It's probably
the only thing I'm good for.

03:40.596 --> 03:41.931
You know that's not true.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.390
It is.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.268
And I'm okay with that.

03:47.353 --> 03:51.857
If I survive...
and that's a big "if"...

03:52.650 --> 03:54.777
I'll probably just keep on doing
what I'm doing.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.279
Just fighting?

03:59.114 --> 04:00.115
Yeah.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.470
Hold fire till we see
the whites of their eyes?

04:21.637 --> 04:22.763
Don't wait for anything.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.181
As soon as you catch
a whiff of the enemy,

04:24.348 --> 04:25.474
blow them all to kingdom come.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.309
- I can do that.
- Sign me up.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.228

05:11.645 --> 05:12.938
There's more grid
in the sky here

05:13.147 --> 05:14.148
than in Charleston.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.233
It's because
we're closer to the tower.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.861
JEANNE: It's like a ghost town.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.030

They think we're in Chicago.

Fingers crossed.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.741
Our hunch that Karen

05:23.907 --> 05:25.034
is following Lourdes
may have paid off.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.160
Also means
you don't have an eye bug.

they'd be here waiting.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.747

a good fight, but...

is that Dan Weaver

encountered movement like...

Sure, but...

09:05.504 --> 09:06.547
What?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.632
The rebels are nervous
about the Volm.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.801
They've left the encampment.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.135
Well, that's understandable.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.555
They've only ever
known each other as enemies.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.307
Maybe we can help with that,

09:17.474 --> 09:19.643
find a way to bring them
closer together.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.471
I am told this is how you greet
one another with honor.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.849
And I am honored to meet you,
Tom Mason.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.601
The honor is mine, sir.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.645
And this is Colonel Dan Weaver.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.856
The brave commander
of the Chicago decoy mission.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.024
Hi.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.401
I stand with you
soldier-to-soldier.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.987
Right. Thank you.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.907
I am Waschak-cha'ab,

13:44.282 --> 13:46.243
commander
of this expeditionary force.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.912
We thank you
for coming to our aid,

13:49.079 --> 13:52.582
and we look forward to a long
and productive association.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.419
I, in turn, offer my thanks

13:56.753 --> 14:01.925
for our victory
and for the life of my son.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.510
Your son?

14:04.261 --> 14:06.680
Waschak-cha'ab is my father.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.351
And now, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.979
I'm sure you'll appreciate
there's much to be done

14:14.145 --> 14:18.942
before we can secure the area
and deploy our defenses.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.613
Um... of course.
We were hoping to discuss

14:23.738 --> 14:25.782
our mutual strategy
for engaging the Espheni.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.159
We have some ideas,
observations, really,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.120
from an indigenous point of view

14:30.287 --> 14:31.329
that we thought
would be of use to you.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.132
I promise
there will be ample time

14:42.257 --> 14:45.468
to go over the information
you have prepared, but...

14:45.677 --> 14:50.348
Oh. I knew there had to be
a "but" in here somewhere.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.268
Please, understand, Colonel.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.729
The Volm have, over time,

14:55.896 --> 14:59.065
developed specific strategies
for engaging the Espheni.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.818
Yes, well,
I would certainly hope so.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.238
What my son is trying to say

15:05.655 --> 15:11.411
is that we have no need for
your participation in this war.

15:11.870 --> 15:16.082
The war is over for you.
It is over for all human beings.

15:16.207 --> 15:20.587
The Volm are well-equipped
to carry the fight to the enemy.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.131
Your military forces
are no longer needed.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.842
In fact,
they will only be in the way.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.429
Commander, with all due respect,
our planet, our fight.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.597
I understand.

15:30.722 --> 15:31.723
<i>WEAVER". I don't think
you do understand.</i>

15:31.890 --> 15:33.642
I don't think you
understand at all.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.101
If you're not interested
in collaborating with us

15:35.226 --> 15:38.021
in this war, then what exactly
are your intentions for us?

15:38.188 --> 15:40.899
You will be relocated
to the south,

15:41.066 --> 15:42.275
a place you call Brazil.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.988
Heh. The hell you say?
Brazil.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.865
You will have
everything you need.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.575
You, your families, and friends

15:50.784 --> 15:53.411
you'll be out of the war zone,
you'll be safe.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.080
The Volm will provide security.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.082
Commander,
this is simply unacceptable.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.542
Nevertheless,
that is what will happen.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.461
Relocation will begin today.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.046
Excuse me, sir,
but, no, it won't.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.422
If you don't want to stand

16:04.714 --> 16:06.466
shoulder-to-shoulder with us
as allies,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.343
that's your privilege,
but this is our home,

16:08.885 --> 16:10.804
and we will fight for it
as we see fit.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.431
You will be relocated,

16:13.848 --> 16:15.475
and that is the end
of our discussion.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.810
Commander,
we don't have any interest

16:16.977 --> 16:18.520
in being sheltered
from this fight.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.063
We've come way too far.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.523
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

16:21.898 --> 16:23.066
Sir, please, ex...

16:23.233 --> 16:24.567
whoa! Ugh!

16:24.734 --> 16:26.194
Tom! Tom!

16:26.361 --> 16:28.321
Colonel, stay where you are.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.872
Lyle, if it any of those trims
end up in this coffee,

16:38.039 --> 16:39.749
it will be
to your eternal regret.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.085
The Professor and Weaver
have been gone for a long time.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.712
What the hell are they doing
with the Volm, anyway?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.380
Talking strategy.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.673
Strategy.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.759
Find fishheads. Kill 'em.
End of story.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.430
You know, if Napoleon had you
by his side in Russia,

16:53.555 --> 16:54.889
things would have gone
a lot better for him.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.642
Thanks.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.979
Hey, Colonel Weaver!

17:01.146 --> 17:02.147
What's the plan?

17:02.272 --> 17:05.442
Get your gear packed up,
ready to move in one hour.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.402
One hour.
That's as much time as we got.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.570
Where's my dad?

17:08.737 --> 17:10.655
He's being detained by the Volm
for the moment.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.032
- Wait. What?
- Can't explain.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.241
Need to get out of here now.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.659
What's the hurry, Colonel?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.787
I'll tell you what the hurry is.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.873
The Volm
want to ship us off to Brazil.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.625
There's still
millions of Espheni forces

17:22.792 --> 17:23.793
here in the United States.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.295
Suddenly we're being
deployed to Brazil?

17:25.462 --> 17:27.464
- That doesn't make any sense.
- They don't want us to fight.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.842
They want to relocate us there,
put us in camps.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.302
- Hell, no.
- No, that's why we're gonna

17:32.427 --> 17:34.888
get out of here before they can
herd us up like cattle.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.806
Colonel Weaver.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.350
What about my dad?
We can't go without him.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.186
Don't you worry about
your dad, son.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.353
I'm gonna get him
out of here with us,

17:42.520 --> 17:44.647
but right now we got to move,
all right?

17:45.023 --> 17:46.066
Let's go, people!

17:46.232 --> 17:48.318
So it turns out the Volm are
no better than the fishheads.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.986
- Isn't that dandy?
- No time for this, Pope.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.530
Get yourself packed
and ready to go.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.762
Whoa. That's okay.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.933
Ohh!

18:20.058 --> 18:21.059
Whew.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.187
Dad? What's wrong?

18:24.354 --> 18:26.147
I'm okay. Hey.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.944
Here. What is this?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.070
Oh. Huh?

18:32.237 --> 18:35.198
Nitroglycerine? Is there
something wrong with your heart?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.201
- Where did you get these?
- Huh? Dr. Glass.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.702
How long have
you been taking it?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.663
- Huh?
- Tell me. How long?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.749
- A couple of months.
- Oh?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.295
Jeanie...

18:50.713 --> 18:52.799
You can't tell
anybody about this, okay?

18:53.049 --> 18:55.051
Especially not Tom.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.097
- Promise me.
- Okay. I promise.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.515
Okay.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.893
(GROANS)

19:06.062 --> 19:08.231
- We should go to Brazil.
- No, sweetheart.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.608
We cannot
go to some concentration camp.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.193
I don't understand
why we can't...

19:12.360 --> 19:14.737
Well, I can explain.
We've got a job to do here,

19:14.904 --> 19:18.366
and I do not trust these Volm
to do it for us.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.743
Besides, sweetheart,
can you really see your old man

19:20.910 --> 19:24.581
sitting around
on a beach somewhere?

19:24.747 --> 19:25.915
We got to go.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.461
(MURMURING)

19:34.883 --> 19:35.925
Hey! Where's my dad?

19:36.259 --> 19:38.678
I assure you, your father
is quite safe, Matt.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.847
- I don't believe you.
- I promise.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.265
You'll be reunited with him

19:42.432 --> 19:43.808
when you board
the transport tonight.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.604
You promise? You played us,
you bubble-headed bastard.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.772
You are mistaken, John Pope.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.275
<i>We will defeat the Espheni,
just as we have promised,</i>

19:52.442 --> 19:54.194
<i>and you will live out
the rest of this war</i>

19:54.360 --> 19:57.363
in comfort and peace and safety.

19:57.739 --> 20:01.034
But right now, it is imperative
that you lay down your weapons

20:01.201 --> 20:02.285
and prepare to leave.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.662
If you really are our allies,
why do we need to disarm?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.040
You will have no need
for weapons in Brazil.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.042
Screw this!

20:09.209 --> 20:10.960
I say we fight our way
out of this snake pit.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.462
Me, too.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.505
Take another look, Pope.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.259
They got those Volm weapons.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.230
Why are you doing this?

20:30.438 --> 20:33.149
Like you,
I am a soldier, Colonel.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.485
And, like you, I obey orders,

20:35.610 --> 20:37.737
whether I agree with them
or not.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.073
Then you know this isn't right.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.243
Please, sir.
I am begging you.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.745
Do not make me use force.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.331
Order your people
to lay down their weapons

20:48.498 --> 20:50.667
and prepare themselves
for transport.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.341
Lay down your weapons!

21:00.802 --> 21:02.053
Live to fight another day.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.722
That's our only play here.

21:11.688 --> 21:17.193
So, this is the endgame
between the grand alliance.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.780
You knew better.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.490
You knew in your gut
it was a mistake.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.867
But Tom, he talked you into it.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.206
Well, congratulations, Colonel.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.168
The Volm have just done
what the fishheads never could,

21:34.335 --> 21:36.004
brought us to our knees.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.892
(DOOR OPENS)

21:50.351 --> 21:52.520
My son should have
warned you in advance

21:52.687 --> 21:55.606
that physical contact
with a Volm commander

21:55.773 --> 21:58.776
is a serious breach
of etiquette.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.573
There are many things I wish
your son had warned me about.

22:04.032 --> 22:07.952
You must understand.
He was under strict orders.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.330
I can see that now.
Lying, it would appear,

22:10.538 --> 22:11.581
is a universal trait.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.667
It was not our intention
to deceive you.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.753
I'm the fool here, though.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.254
I naively thought
that we had a friendship,

22:18.421 --> 22:19.630
your son and I.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.259
Professor,
why are you so resistant

22:23.593 --> 22:25.595
to doing as we ask?

22:25.887 --> 22:27.930
It is for your own benefit.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.515
That is where you're wrong, sir.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.268
I would have thought that
Cochise

22:32.435 --> 22:35.438
might have explained who we are
as a species, at least.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.443
Yes, but we have, to date,

22:40.568 --> 22:45.365
only encountered dull and pliant
indigenous species

22:45.531 --> 22:47.909
of the many planets
we have liberated.

22:48.451 --> 22:52.663
Not a single one of them
has ever resisted relocation.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.832
In fact, they have welcomed it.

22:54.957 --> 22:58.669
So you will understand
that we are confused

22:58.795 --> 23:03.383
by your resilience,
your tenacity.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.426
We can also be selfish
and self-centered.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.887
<i>We're no strangers to</i> war...

23:08.096 --> 23:09.972
devastating wars...

23:10.681 --> 23:11.682
fought between ourselves

23:11.808 --> 23:14.060
for reasons
that now seem very petty.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.688
But we are also passionate
about our right to exist.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.441
And we adamantly oppose

23:20.608 --> 23:22.693
those who would oppress
or deny us our freedoms.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.155
And we would rather die
than have those rights

23:26.364 --> 23:28.032
taken away
as the Espheni have tried.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.835
Yes.
I can see that is true.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.088
Then allow us to fight.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.674
Commander, allow us to fight,

23:44.882 --> 23:47.176
and I promise you we will
prove ourselves tenfold

23:47.385 --> 23:49.011
if you give us a chance.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.600
I am only a warrior.

23:56.894 --> 24:01.691
I have never wandered
from that narrow profession.

24:01.858 --> 24:06.529
Never have I questioned
protocol or orders...

24:08.489 --> 24:09.949
until now,

24:11.617 --> 24:16.956
which I find most disturbing,
disorienting.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.377
I've been told by your son,
in fact,

24:21.544 --> 24:24.130
that we have that effect.

24:25.715 --> 24:29.635
You have given me much
to contemplate, Professor Mason.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.890
- We shall talk further on this.
- I look forward to that.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.575
Hey, uh...

24:52.742 --> 24:53.826
Can you give me a second?

24:56.537 --> 24:58.956
(BREATHING ERRATICALLY)

25:05.838 --> 25:07.215
Lourdes.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.469
How are you feeling?

25:12.553 --> 25:15.181
I've got a skull full of worms.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.558
They're going crazy,
writhing around in there.

25:17.767 --> 25:18.935
How do you think I feel?

25:20.436 --> 25:22.772
I'm so sorry, Lourdes.
I know exactly how you feel.

25:22.939 --> 25:27.109
Aah! I need them out!
Please!

25:29.070 --> 25:31.322
<i>Please take them out!</i>

25:32.740 --> 25:34.909
Hey. Hey, hey-

25:35.076 --> 25:36.661
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.038
I'm gonna make sure

25:40.957 --> 25:44.669
But you got to be patient.
Now, do you trust me?

25:46.504 --> 25:48.798
Yeah. I always have.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.927
Ever since the beginning.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.388
You remember those days?

25:55.513 --> 25:56.806
Yeah.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.725
You'd bring me food
after all my scouts.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.519
And you'd make sure I was okay.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.981
It seems like
a thousand years ago.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.067
Now it's my turn
to make sure you're okay.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.453
That's a promise.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.503

26:28.170 --> 26:29.505

out of her misery.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.320
Why would you say that?

26:52.737 --> 26:54.614
You want Karen
and the whole Espheni army

26:54.780 --> 26:56.115
to know where we are?

27:01.162 --> 27:02.455
Are you ready, Colonel Weaver?

27:02.622 --> 27:03.706
Where's Tom?

27:03.873 --> 27:05.207
He will be joining you.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.675
Let's go.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.450
MATT: Dad!

27:47.249 --> 27:48.668
Are we really going to Brazil?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.295
I don't think we've got
much of a choice in the matter.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.339
You all right?

27:53.839 --> 27:55.591
I'm okay now that
I'm back with you guys.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.992
You are free to go
wherever you please,

28:22.368 --> 28:23.703

28:40.678 --> 28:43.180
You know we're gonna
continue to fight.

28:43.514 --> 28:44.557
I know.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.018
I can't guarantee
that we won't get in your way.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.939
Yes, I imagined as much.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.150
Take this.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.653
I suspect it will come in handy.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.698
Be careful, Tom Mason.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.493
Thank you, my friend.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.831
I hope I see you again soon.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.502
I cannot imagine
anything more pleasing.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.297
Now go.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.809
You know, my son,
they will not survive.

die in captivity,

29:31.395 --> 29:33.189

29:33.564 --> 29:34.857
Of that I have no doubt.

29:35.024 --> 29:37.610
In all the history of this war,
we have never allowed

29:37.818 --> 29:40.321
the indigenous population
to be in harm's way.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.990
We have sworn an oath
to protect them.

29:43.866 --> 29:46.952
But, as you must realize by now,
these humans are different.

29:47.077 --> 29:51.540
Yes. For their sake,
I sincerely hope so.

30:13.604 --> 30:14.688
What?

30:16.899 --> 30:18.901
Just the smell of fresh pine.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.195
It's good to get
out of the city.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.155
It gets my blood flowing.

30:24.198 --> 30:25.324
It's not the mountain air.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.660
It's the fact that you think
the war's gonna go on.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.830
You think you want it to end.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.290
But trust me, Hal,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.668
you'd never cut it
in a split-level house.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.003
Spending your weekends

30:38.212 --> 30:40.172

and weeding flower beds?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.966
You'd go stark raving mad.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.425
She's right, kid.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.554
Compared to the quiet
desperation of the suburbs,

30:46.887 --> 30:49.598
I'd say an alien apocalypse
is paradise on earth.

30:53.727 --> 30:57.273
Hardly. These woods are filled
with mosquitos, ticks,

30:57.398 --> 30:59.316
eager to gorge themselves
on our blood.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.152

what Lyme disease does to you?

31:10.160 --> 31:12.121
Wait!

- What you got?
- Not sure.

- It's her.

<i>Thank goodness you're okay, Hal.</i>

32:36.205 --> 32:37.373
I've missed you.

32:38.207 --> 32:39.875
Yeah, I've been looking forward
to seeing you, too.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.129
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't kill you!

32:44.296 --> 32:45.381
Easy, Tom.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.385
This is far more important
than our personal differences.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.471
It's about the Volm.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.806
Get to the point.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.433
I see things haven't turned out
the way you planned.

32:57.393 --> 33:00.145
You and your beloved allies
have parted ways.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.857
Not the knights in shining armor
you thought they were, right?

33:05.567 --> 33:06.860
That's far enough.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.447
I'd say you've become
an expert on disappointment.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.533
In fact, I think the only reason
you want to talk

33:12.700 --> 33:14.118
<i>is the Volm have you on the run.</i>

33:14.660 --> 33:15.911
You don't trust me.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.831
<i>I would feel the same
if I were in your shoes.</i>

33:19.206 --> 33:21.250
<i>I could tell you
I've made mistakes,</i>

33:21.583 --> 33:23.419
that I regret the way
I've gone about some things,

33:23.585 --> 33:25.713
but those would just seem
like empty words to you.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.256
You got that right.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.800
Which is why I didn't expect
to reconcile our differences

33:30.009 --> 33:31.260
in one conversation.
