WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.670
All right, now explode,

00:04.672 --> 00:05.671
full power.

00:05.673 --> 00:06.605
100%.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.306
That is 100%.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.008
PSI of those jabs
is averaging 129.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.076
On the power scale, that's...

00:13.078 --> 00:14.744
Kitten. Sad kitten.

00:14.746 --> 00:15.745
Left up

00:15.747 --> 00:16.612
and sting it.

00:16.614 --> 00:17.613
(grunting)

00:17.615 --> 00:19.615
(motorcycle roaring)

00:19.617 --> 00:21.516
SYLVESTER:
Speaking of sting,

00:21.518 --> 00:22.517
Chet again.

00:22.519 --> 00:24.352
And an a.m. drop-off.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.159
See you again tonight?

00:33.161 --> 00:35.226
Sure thing. Thanks for the lift.
Yeah.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.662
(motorcycle roaring)

00:42.299 --> 00:43.765
What's wrong
with your bike?

00:43.767 --> 00:46.367
New clutch is on back order.

00:46.369 --> 00:47.668
TOBY: I know we've
both moved on,

00:47.670 --> 00:50.370
but she's parading her new fling
right in my face?

00:50.372 --> 00:52.672
She's just

00:52.674 --> 00:54.407
so cold and mechanical.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.375
You want to distract
yourself from her,

00:56.377 --> 00:58.377
then grow a set and focus.

00:58.379 --> 01:01.546
(shouting,
grunting)

01:01.548 --> 01:03.281
There you go.
Now you're getting it, kid!

01:03.283 --> 01:05.349
(grunting)

01:07.119 --> 01:09.786
WOMAN:  Hello?  Excuse me.

01:11.122 --> 01:12.821
Can we help you?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.456
Deputy Homeland Director
Katherine Cooper.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.224
Where is... Molina?

01:17.226 --> 01:20.594
I'm Scorpion's
Homeland liaison now.

01:20.596 --> 01:22.062
Deputy director.

01:22.064 --> 01:23.396
Downgrade.

01:23.398 --> 01:24.663
She cutting our funding, too?

01:24.665 --> 01:27.132
Your funding is intact.

01:27.134 --> 01:29.200
She just doesn't want
to... interact with you,

01:29.202 --> 01:31.502
because of the
prior... interaction.

01:31.504 --> 01:33.070
SYLVESTER:
She wanted to leave me

01:33.072 --> 01:33.770
to die

01:33.772 --> 01:34.637
in a jail.

01:34.639 --> 01:36.472
She's easily alienated.

01:36.474 --> 01:37.473
TOBY:
You seem edgy.

01:37.475 --> 01:38.407
Why are you so edgy?

01:38.409 --> 01:39.408
I'm not edgy. I'm just...

01:39.410 --> 01:40.575
I'm pressed for time,

01:40.577 --> 01:42.710
and I have
a classified mission to assign.

01:42.712 --> 01:45.245
And it smells<i> so</i> bad in here.

01:45.247 --> 01:47.080
Is that... intentional?

01:47.082 --> 01:48.748
That is Toby.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.950
Because
this is

01:50.951 --> 01:53.151
a black operation,
my information is need-to-know.

01:53.154 --> 01:56.155
Walter O'Brien, Cabe
Gallo, Happy Quinn,

01:56.157 --> 01:58.157
join me in my SUV. TOBY: Hmm.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.124
You heading north or south?

01:59.126 --> 02:00.158
Ooh,
eye flutter

02:00.160 --> 02:01.225
on "south."

02:01.227 --> 02:01.825
Huntington,

02:01.827 --> 02:03.159
Long Beach, San Pedro...

02:03.161 --> 02:04.226
San Pedro it is, meaning water.

02:04.228 --> 02:05.493
SYLVESTER:
The ports.

02:05.495 --> 02:06.193
A frigate?

02:06.195 --> 02:07.344
Can we leave now?

02:07.345 --> 02:08.494
And you can only take three
of the team,

02:08.497 --> 02:09.662
so space is an issue.

02:09.664 --> 02:11.497
A submarine.
It's a submarine, isn't it?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.499
Anyway,
Homeland needs

02:13.501 --> 02:16.869
Scorpion's help for a black-ops
nuclear submarine mission

02:16.871 --> 02:20.238
deep in international waters
off the coast of California?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.607
Ooh.

02:22.609 --> 02:23.507
WALTER:
They'll be needing me

02:23.509 --> 02:24.174
to code?

02:25.143 --> 02:26.376
I'll get my laptop.

02:26.377 --> 02:27.610
HAPPY: And I will be
building something,

02:27.612 --> 02:28.877
so I'll get my tools.

02:28.879 --> 02:30.778
SYLVESTER: And I will
get my party hat

02:30.780 --> 02:33.413
because I don't have
to go on a submarine.

02:33.415 --> 02:34.614
CABE:
And I'll be going

02:34.616 --> 02:36.616
to keep anyone
from wanting to kill them.

02:38.252 --> 02:40.585
Welcome to Scorpion.

02:40.587 --> 02:43.788
I'm still reading an edge.
What's up with that?

02:43.790 --> 02:47.224
You just disclosed details
on a classified mission.

02:47.226 --> 02:49.759
I just need to know that
you'll keep this confidential.

02:51.262 --> 02:53.228
What's confidential?

02:53.230 --> 02:54.596
Who's this?

02:54.598 --> 02:56.864
Uh, he's, um, my...

02:56.866 --> 02:57.898
my friend.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.266
RAY:
Hey, buddy.

02:59.268 --> 03:00.267
SYLVESTER:
He's using

03:00.269 --> 03:01.334
my mug.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.268
He's staying here?

03:04.604 --> 03:05.703
You need
to get...

03:05.705 --> 03:08.505
Mr. Saigon
out of here.

03:08.507 --> 03:12.308
Things are dicey between
Scorpion and Director Molina,

03:12.310 --> 03:14.176
and you can't
afford any more...

03:14.178 --> 03:15.677
issues.

03:15.679 --> 03:20.448
Walter, we never discussed
Ray staying in the Airstream,

03:20.450 --> 03:24.218
and he doesn't present a
professional image, so...

03:26.222 --> 03:27.354
You got to go.

03:27.356 --> 03:28.521
For the good
of the team.

03:28.523 --> 03:29.722
RAY:
Okay.

03:29.724 --> 03:32.458
Just need to get the Grem
out of lockdown

03:32.460 --> 03:34.359
and then...
on my way.

03:34.361 --> 03:36.160
I'll take you to the lot.
Sweet. Thank you.

03:36.162 --> 03:38.829
Actually, if you could drive
my car back, I would...

03:38.831 --> 03:41.631
appreciate it. They won't
release a car in the impound lot

03:41.633 --> 03:44.166
to someone with
a suspended license, which...

03:44.168 --> 03:45.467
I don't even understand that.

03:45.469 --> 03:48.403
Oh, this just keeps
getting better.

03:50.874 --> 03:52.273
That's your new friend,
and you're just gonna kick him

03:52.275 --> 03:53.474
to the curb?
Just like that?

03:53.476 --> 03:55.409
Yes.

03:57.546 --> 04:00.579
I am surrounded by robots.

04:02.282 --> 04:03.614
Now that we have some privacy...

04:03.616 --> 04:04.881
We don't. I'm on comms

04:04.883 --> 04:06.282
with the team.
We'll stay that way

04:06.283 --> 04:07.682
on the sub,
piggybacking on the antennae.

04:07.685 --> 04:09.284
COOPER:
Fine. But...

04:09.286 --> 04:10.785
under no circumstances

04:10.787 --> 04:13.788
will you disclose the location
of the sub once you're on board.

04:13.790 --> 04:14.889
The Navy insists

04:14.891 --> 04:17.041
that remains classified.

04:17.042 --> 04:19.192
50 bucks I can figure out
their exact location anyway.

04:19.195 --> 04:20.794
You want to bet?
It's a bet. We got a bet?

04:20.796 --> 04:23.463
You have a serious problem.
No duh.

04:23.465 --> 04:25.298
COOPER:
We're going to San Pedro

04:25.300 --> 04:27.900
to ferry you out
to a special ops nuclear sub.

04:27.902 --> 04:30.202
The mission is to
analyze a Vulture,

04:30.204 --> 04:31.436
an ocean floor
data hunter,

04:31.438 --> 04:34.572
attached to
an underwater fiber optic cable

04:34.574 --> 04:36.907
on the floor
of the Pacific Ocean.

04:36.909 --> 04:37.908
Attached by whom?

04:37.910 --> 04:39.643
Not yet determined.

04:39.644 --> 04:41.377
But the device is
tapping a highly secure

04:41.380 --> 04:44.314
line between the United States
Department of Defense

04:44.316 --> 04:46.215
and the Chinese government
in Shanghai.

04:46.217 --> 04:47.516
<i> Happy, we need you to build</i>

04:47.518 --> 04:49.384
<i> an extension</i>
<i> to the submarine's arm.</i>

04:49.386 --> 04:50.918
<i> We'll use it to tap a cable</i>
<i> from Walter's computer</i>

04:50.920 --> 04:52.787
<i> into the listening device.</i>

04:52.788 --> 04:54.655
<i> Walter, you'll hack</i>
<i> into the device's mainframe</i>

04:54.657 --> 04:55.922
<i> and identify</i>
<i> whoever is intercepting</i>

04:55.924 --> 04:57.757
<i> our communications.</i>

04:57.759 --> 05:00.292
MAN:
<i> Welcome aboard the XB-4.</i>

05:00.294 --> 05:01.626
I'm Captain Steven Jones.

05:01.628 --> 05:03.961
This is Ensign Nathan Hall,
our Bullgeorge.

05:03.963 --> 05:06.330
He'll be looking after
you riders during this mission.

05:06.332 --> 05:08.298
We have eight other crew members

05:08.300 --> 05:10.566
in the Forward
Operational Compartment.

05:10.568 --> 05:12.768
Ballast tank, trim tank,

05:12.770 --> 05:15.637
reactor control,
turbine control.

05:15.639 --> 05:16.805
It's gearhead heaven.

05:16.806 --> 05:17.972
JONES:
And all highly classified.

05:17.974 --> 05:20.274
What you see here
stays here.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.342
This mission is top secret.
No one outside of Langley

05:22.344 --> 05:24.410
knows our objective or location.

05:24.412 --> 05:25.644
Captain, we're
rigged for dive.

05:25.646 --> 05:27.579
Very well. Take the conn,
submerge the ship.

05:27.581 --> 05:29.380
I have the conn!

05:29.382 --> 05:31.648
Ahead
two-thirds.

05:31.650 --> 05:33.549
Dive, dive, dive.
Five-degree down bubble.

05:33.551 --> 05:36.752
Make your depth 200 feet.
Come left to course 270.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.620
This, uh, crew is different

05:38.622 --> 05:41.422
from most of the military
we have worked with.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.556
We get 18 months of training

05:42.558 --> 05:44.291
before ever seeing
the inside of a sub.

05:44.293 --> 05:46.393
A lot of us here
are nuclear engineers.

05:46.395 --> 05:47.360
It makes the hierarchy
a little different

05:47.362 --> 05:48.694
from the rest
of the military.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.696
We do have a saying,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.564
"When hundreds
of feet below,

05:52.566 --> 05:54.432
the power goes to he who knows."

05:54.434 --> 05:55.933
Or she.

05:55.935 --> 05:57.501
Or she.

05:57.503 --> 05:58.935
Zing. Happy.

05:58.937 --> 06:00.870
Great use
of her humor programming.

06:00.872 --> 06:03.372
I need to check on the crew.
Give me just a second.

06:03.374 --> 06:04.406
TOBY:
Walter, what's your speed?

06:04.408 --> 06:07.041
Uh, I estimate
about 20 knots.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.309
My lunch.

06:09.311 --> 06:10.843
It's conveniently shaped.

06:10.845 --> 06:12.477
And our best way
of figuring out their location.

06:12.479 --> 06:14.378
They left
San Pedro

06:14.380 --> 06:16.847
at 8:25.
(whooshing sound)

06:16.849 --> 06:19.850
Roughly 20 knots
for 30 minutes.

06:19.852 --> 06:22.953
Sub would head
for closest, deepest water.

06:22.955 --> 06:25.855
That would be right off
the Palos Verdes shelf break.

06:25.857 --> 06:27.489
Putting you 15 miles

06:27.491 --> 06:28.690
east

06:28.692 --> 06:29.757
of Catalina Island.

06:29.759 --> 06:30.758
WALTER:
Miss.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.759
Ah.

06:31.761 --> 06:33.427
See, I don't
like the mojo

06:33.429 --> 06:35.762
of playing Battleship
with an actual battleship.

06:35.764 --> 06:37.563
It's not Battleship.
It's Battle Sub.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.299
32 degrees north...
(whistles)

06:40.301 --> 06:43.602
117 degrees west.
(whooshing sound)

06:43.604 --> 06:46.338
Point Loma?

06:46.340 --> 06:48.673
Call that a hit.
Walter,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.408
I'm gonna sink
your battle sub.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.442
Please, don't harm the...

06:52.411 --> 06:53.676
...pickles.

06:53.678 --> 06:55.511
NATHAN:
Hey, we're dark.

06:55.513 --> 06:57.045
No outgoing communication.

06:57.047 --> 06:58.880
Half my team's
on the mainland.

06:58.882 --> 07:00.715
They will be the only half
not incarcerated

07:00.717 --> 07:03.417
if information is leaked.
Your orders

07:03.419 --> 07:05.018
to disallow communications
are illogical.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.020
Toby and Sylvester
are part of this team.

07:07.022 --> 07:08.755
I have my orders.
You have my instructions.

07:08.757 --> 07:10.490
And you will

07:10.492 --> 07:10.990
follow them.

07:27.808 --> 07:29.340
(crunch)

07:29.342 --> 07:31.508
I think Captain
just Crunched their comms.

07:31.510 --> 07:32.709
I'm picking up bits and pieces,

07:32.711 --> 07:34.377
but I can barely make anything
out.

07:36.714 --> 07:39.081
Follow me.

07:44.955 --> 07:48.122
I thought they were supposed
to be working<i> with</i> us.

07:48.124 --> 07:51.458
Military protocol doesn't
have a lot of flexibility.

07:51.460 --> 07:55.695
Let's say we
toe the line.

07:55.697 --> 07:57.363
("Flea Market Montgomery" song playing)
I still can't make anything out.

07:57.365 --> 07:59.431
This cancels our bet.
No bet. Bet off.

07:59.433 --> 08:02.434
Whatever. I'm just trying
to enjoy my off time.

08:02.436 --> 08:04.068
♪ To the left, to the right ♪

08:04.070 --> 08:06.070
SYLVESTER AND MAN: ♪ It's
just like, it's just like ♪

08:06.072 --> 08:09.039
♪ A mini mall, hey, hey... ♪

08:09.041 --> 08:10.440
PAIGE:
<i> You got to be kidding me.</i>

08:10.442 --> 08:12.158
Ma'am, it's not my problem

08:12.159 --> 08:13.875
that your husband doesn't pay
his parking tickets.

08:13.878 --> 08:15.444
He is not my husband.

08:15.446 --> 08:18.413
And $1,200 is $1,100 over

08:18.415 --> 08:20.081
the value of the car.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.450
I'd counter that you can't put
a price on the value of a home.

08:22.452 --> 08:24.518
Just a few forms
to fill out.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.520
Pen.

08:27.523 --> 08:30.123
I'll handle it.
Cool.

08:32.093 --> 08:35.094
NATHAN: <i> Let's see</i> <i> if
you're worth your salt.</i>

08:35.096 --> 08:37.629
The rods and clamps I affixed
to the main jib

08:37.631 --> 08:40.798
will act like the arms of
an arthroscopic surgery device.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.398
Extending now.

08:45.536 --> 08:47.502
<i> We'll use the camera</i>

08:47.504 --> 08:49.003
to find the communication port

08:49.005 --> 08:50.603
on the listening
device.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.507
There.

08:57.577 --> 08:58.576
Not bad.

08:59.679 --> 09:02.146
WALTER:
Access port exposed.

09:02.148 --> 09:04.648
Happy, connect the cable.

09:04.650 --> 09:07.617
And we're in.

09:07.619 --> 09:09.485
Uploading their interface.

09:09.487 --> 09:10.953
Toby calls us robots,
but, tell me,

09:10.955 --> 09:12.955
what's more fascinating
than a robot?

09:12.957 --> 09:14.957
Oh, he endlessly
analyzes feelings,

09:14.959 --> 09:18.560
Sylvester is a mess of feelings,
Paige helps us sort them.

09:18.562 --> 09:21.896
But without the metal gears
of the machine, it doesn't run.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.464
CABE: I guess my
role  is to kick

09:23.466 --> 09:25.666
the machine when it starts
talking and doesn't focus.

09:25.668 --> 09:28.068
NATHAN: We've
analyzed the exterior

09:28.069 --> 09:30.469
construction of the device--
Swiss metalwork, Dutch wiring--

09:30.472 --> 09:32.605
but no clue
as to who put it there.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.674
I'm in the main interface.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.510
I thought this would take
an hour at least.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.016
Why are you stopping?

09:46.018 --> 09:47.183
That seemed a little too easy.
Happy,

09:47.185 --> 09:48.751
detach the cabling
for the device.

09:48.753 --> 09:50.452
Aye, aye. What are you doing?
We're in the middle

09:50.454 --> 09:52.587
of a mission, damn near the end.
My instinct  says

09:52.589 --> 09:54.055
that this is a dummy interface,

09:54.057 --> 09:55.723
a lure to draw us
into the system

09:55.725 --> 09:57.191
to plant some malware

09:57.193 --> 09:57.958
onto your sub

09:57.960 --> 09:59.125
or something worse.

09:59.127 --> 10:00.793
Worse like what?
Aborting the mission

10:00.795 --> 10:03.529
requires a direct order from the captain.
Then get it,

10:03.531 --> 10:05.864
fast, 'cause I have a feeling
we want to be as far away

10:05.866 --> 10:07.065
from that device as possible.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.566
Walter, tell me
what's happening.

10:08.568 --> 10:09.567
Sir.

10:09.569 --> 10:10.935
(boom)

10:10.937 --> 10:12.503
Whoa.

10:12.505 --> 10:15.873
(alarm beeping)

10:15.875 --> 10:17.708
♪ Hey, hey, don't stop ♪

10:17.710 --> 10:20.977
♪ Let's make it a dance,
come on now... ♪

10:20.979 --> 10:23.045
(static) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Turn that down.
Listen to this.

10:23.047 --> 10:24.713
JONES:
Flooding... engine room!

10:24.715 --> 10:25.947
Something's wrong.

10:25.949 --> 10:27.615
Come on, Happy. Not funny.

10:27.617 --> 10:31.518
I told you we shouldn't
have played Battle Sub.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.219
NATHAN: Reactor's scrammed.
We've lost propulsion.

10:33.221 --> 10:34.820
Lost depth
control.

10:34.822 --> 10:36.721
Prepare for impact!
We're gonna hit the ocean floor!

10:56.208 --> 10:58.608
Is everyone okay?

10:58.610 --> 10:59.909
WALTER:
Fine.

10:59.911 --> 11:01.777
HAPPY:
Good.

11:01.779 --> 11:03.845
How did this happen?
There was an explosive device

11:03.847 --> 11:07.882
on the Vulture to keep it
from being hacked or captured.

11:07.884 --> 11:11.218
We need to do
a vessel diagnostic.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.520
HAPPY:
I'll help. Electric has failed.

11:13.522 --> 11:14.787
Engines have failed.

11:14.789 --> 11:16.989
We're settled
at a 40-degree angle.

11:16.991 --> 11:19.825
Well, the size of the blast
was likely enough to flood

11:19.827 --> 11:22.260
the compartments between here
and the rest of the crew.

11:22.262 --> 11:23.728
Communications are out.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.730
And my team doesn't know
where we are

11:25.732 --> 11:27.765
because you killed our comms.

11:27.766 --> 11:29.799
It gets worse. The Navy
won't know that we're missing

11:29.802 --> 11:31.034
until we don't arrive
at our rendezvous point

11:31.036 --> 11:32.702
in six hours, and
for security purposes

11:32.704 --> 11:34.003
only the people on the submarine

11:34.005 --> 11:35.604
know the course
that was charted.

11:36.873 --> 11:38.772
(tapping in Morse code)

11:38.774 --> 11:40.907
Thank God they're alive.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.175
(tapping in Morse code
continues)

11:43.177 --> 11:45.810
"Electric down.

11:45.812 --> 11:47.912
"Trying to get the hatch open.

11:47.914 --> 11:49.713
We're compromised."

11:49.715 --> 11:51.948
(tapping in Morse code
continues)

11:54.319 --> 11:56.252
"No generator."

11:56.254 --> 11:57.786
No oxygen system.

11:57.788 --> 11:59.954
The shared ventilation
system provides

11:59.956 --> 12:03.657
all of us with roughly
150 cubic feet of oxygen.

12:03.659 --> 12:05.091
Divide that by 13,

12:05.093 --> 12:08.694
each consuming 1.5 cubic feet
of oxygen per hour,

12:08.696 --> 12:11.963
we have one hour and ten minutes
of oxygen left.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.800
CABE: I'm a Marine--
I spent a lot of time on a ship.

12:15.802 --> 12:18.269
You have immersion suits
down here for underwater escape.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.903
Uh, we do,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.070
but not in this
compartment.

12:21.072 --> 12:22.905
Then we need
to get a message out.

12:22.907 --> 12:24.907
Where's the communications
panel? Maybe I can fix it.

12:24.909 --> 12:26.675
No, we're supposed
to be running silent.

12:26.677 --> 12:28.076
I believe our directive
has changed.

12:29.112 --> 12:30.778
The communications?

12:30.780 --> 12:32.913
In the bow,

12:32.915 --> 12:34.247
past that bulkhead.

12:34.249 --> 12:36.349
CABE:
Let me go check.

12:36.351 --> 12:38.651
We're gonna need all hands.
All hands.

12:38.653 --> 12:39.818
Happy, come in.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.085
XB-4, come in.

12:41.087 --> 12:43.087
TOBY:
Yes, I'm here.

12:43.089 --> 12:45.155
I don't care
what meeting she's in.

12:45.157 --> 12:46.856
Tell Director Cooper
there's an emergency.

12:47.758 --> 12:48.790
Giving me the runaround.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.658
Then run around<i> her.</i>

12:50.660 --> 12:53.694
We're gonna go see
this Cooper.

12:53.696 --> 12:55.195
Your car is in the shop.

12:56.731 --> 12:58.798
That was painful.

12:58.799 --> 13:00.866
This whole experience
has been painful. Odd.

13:00.868 --> 13:03.201
Most people who come
in here are real upbeat.

13:03.203 --> 13:04.669
(phone ringing)
There you go.

13:04.671 --> 13:05.836
Your keys.

13:08.841 --> 13:11.675
You've got good news for me,
right? I've won the lottery?

13:11.677 --> 13:13.643
Wrong. Where are the keys
to your car?

13:13.645 --> 13:14.777
I need them now.

13:14.779 --> 13:16.145
They're in my purse.

13:17.648 --> 13:20.081
Then you need to go
to Cooper's office right now.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.916
I'm gonna explain later,
but Cabe, Walter

13:21.918 --> 13:23.717
and Happy are in
serious trouble.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.151
Okay.

13:25.153 --> 13:26.852
Where the hell is he?

13:26.854 --> 13:29.821
Ray! I got to go!

13:29.823 --> 13:31.222
Oh, God.

13:36.195 --> 13:39.028
Hey, they got doughnuts
in the break room.

13:41.799 --> 13:43.265
Paige?

13:45.002 --> 13:46.768
Okay.

13:48.404 --> 13:50.203
(metallic creaking)

13:50.205 --> 13:52.405
(panting):
The water is freezing.

13:52.407 --> 13:53.973
Yeah, well, at this depth

13:53.975 --> 13:55.975
the temperature
can't be more than 28 degrees.

13:55.977 --> 13:58.844
You have an interesting
breadth of knowledge.

13:58.846 --> 14:00.645
The entire system

14:00.647 --> 14:01.946
was shorted in the explosion.

14:01.948 --> 14:03.847
I've circumvented a number
of blown circuits to see

14:03.849 --> 14:05.782
if there's any way
to bring this back to life.

14:05.784 --> 14:06.949
Okay, Cabe,

14:06.951 --> 14:09.318
on my call, hit the
breaker on the wall.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.118
Go.

14:12.021 --> 14:14.688
(electric humming)

14:14.690 --> 14:16.122
We good?

14:16.858 --> 14:18.357
(electric crackling)

14:18.359 --> 14:20.158
HAPPY: We are not good!
Keep it out

14:20.160 --> 14:21.859
of the water,
or we're all dead!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.760
(electric crackling)

14:25.196 --> 14:26.361
(grunts)

14:26.363 --> 14:28.663
(gasping breaths)

14:31.434 --> 14:32.433
That was close.

14:32.435 --> 14:34.401
It's fried.

14:34.403 --> 14:36.836
We have zero communication
with the surface.

14:36.838 --> 14:38.404
TOBY:<i> The only way</i>
<i> we're gonna find them</i>

14:38.406 --> 14:40.005
is if we pinpoint
their location.

14:40.007 --> 14:43.908
Before they went dark, we had Point Loma.
Walter said

14:43.910 --> 14:45.109
they were at 20 knots.

14:45.111 --> 14:47.243
I'm saying good guess.

14:50.114 --> 14:51.446
This is an arc
representing

14:51.448 --> 14:53.881
35 minutes, 22 knots
from Point Loma.

14:53.883 --> 14:55.182
We don't know exactly

14:55.184 --> 14:56.349
where the secret
underwater cable is

14:56.351 --> 14:57.917
that connects
the U.S. and China,

14:57.919 --> 14:59.218
but if it follows
a similar route

14:59.220 --> 15:00.819
to the Trans-Pacific Express
cable...

15:06.059 --> 15:08.059
And there's...

15:08.061 --> 15:11.095
a very rough guess as to
the whereabouts of our sub.

15:12.164 --> 15:14.096
With a bite taken out of it.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.766
(tires screech)

15:18.768 --> 15:22.002
Oh... God.

15:28.877 --> 15:30.877
(phone rings)

15:30.879 --> 15:32.712
Yeah, I'm here.
What do you have?

15:32.714 --> 15:33.713
The rough coordinates

15:33.715 --> 15:34.947
for Cooper--
I'm texting them now.

15:35.950 --> 15:38.850
(tapping in Morse code)

15:38.852 --> 15:40.885
They're saying the sub
has listed too far.

15:40.887 --> 15:43.053
The silt is blocking
their port hatch.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.387
They can't get out.

15:44.389 --> 15:46.989
Ask them from now on
to keep it to good news only.

15:46.991 --> 15:48.824
I will not suggest that
to the captain.

15:48.826 --> 15:51.126
So they have the escape
suits in their compartment

15:51.128 --> 15:54.963
and no way out, and we have
a way out but no escape suits.

15:54.965 --> 15:56.764
Even if we did have
the immersion suits,

15:56.766 --> 15:58.398
it's doubtful we could survive
in water this cold.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.900
You'd have ten minutes before
severe hypothermia set in,

16:00.902 --> 16:02.935
and that's<i> if</i> you
made it to the surface.

16:02.937 --> 16:05.237
Which is highly unlikely, given
that we're 300 feet down.

16:05.239 --> 16:07.906
What's the depth rating
of those survival suits?

16:07.908 --> 16:09.073
225 feet.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.510
Here.

16:13.512 --> 16:15.778
NATHAN:
There seems to be

16:15.780 --> 16:18.180
some kind of plan forming here,
and as commanding officer,

16:18.182 --> 16:20.916
I'm the one who should
be making these decisions.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.951
Well, I thought the power
goes to he who knows.

16:22.953 --> 16:25.386
And we know how to build
one of those suits from scratch.

16:25.388 --> 16:27.888
You just listed all the ways
that it's certain death.

16:27.890 --> 16:29.923
Sitting here is certain death--
what we're talking about

16:29.925 --> 16:31.224
is just<i> likely</i> death.

16:31.226 --> 16:32.825
I should volunteer then.

16:34.895 --> 16:36.527
I'll go.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.795
I'm the biggest
and most immune to hypothermia.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.230
You know if you leave, there's a good
chance that you die before any of us.

16:41.232 --> 16:42.965
I'm the most expendable.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.833
I can't risk Happy and you.

16:44.835 --> 16:45.900
And you know the sub.

16:46.769 --> 16:48.835
Greater good.

16:49.938 --> 16:52.038
Greater good.

16:57.044 --> 16:59.010
COOPER:
<i> The Navy isn't going to send</i>

16:59.012 --> 17:00.428
a rescue

17:00.429 --> 17:01.845
unless the sub misses
its rendezvous

17:01.848 --> 17:03.280
or there's proof
of failure.

17:03.282 --> 17:05.181
The Navy has
absolutely no evidence

17:05.183 --> 17:07.383
there's anything gone wrong
with this mission.

17:07.385 --> 17:10.285
We were in communication
with the sub when it went down.

17:10.287 --> 17:11.352
Well, I told them that.

17:11.354 --> 17:12.886
They're of the opinion

17:12.888 --> 17:14.420
your team was listening in
on an illegal signal

17:14.422 --> 17:16.455
that just happened
to break down.

17:16.457 --> 17:18.990
Nothing to warrant
a rescue mission.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.958
My people are smarter
than your people.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.127
I have coordinates for
where the sub might be.

17:24.129 --> 17:26.295
You don't want to
wake up tomorrow

17:26.297 --> 17:29.097
knowing you could have helped
save 13 people who died

17:29.099 --> 17:30.998
because you followed the rules.

17:34.036 --> 17:36.136
I feel like the Michelin Man.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.403
WALTER:
Okay, Cabe, once you reach

17:37.405 --> 17:39.271
the surface...
You have one cartridge.

17:39.273 --> 17:41.039
Parachute flare--
visible

17:41.041 --> 17:42.290
for 30 miles.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.540
When you get help,
get the Navy to send

17:43.543 --> 17:45.843
a Deep Submergence Rescue
Vehicle out of San Diego.

17:45.845 --> 17:47.428
Regardless of where we're at,

17:47.429 --> 17:49.012
it'll take at least 150 minutes
to get here.

17:49.014 --> 17:50.380
We'll be out of oxygen.

17:50.382 --> 17:52.882
HAPPY:
After you get rescued--

17:52.884 --> 17:55.584
and you will get rescued--
you get this list to Toby.

17:55.586 --> 17:57.953
It's everything they'll need
to make an oxygen tank

17:57.955 --> 17:59.287
they can load down to us.

17:59.289 --> 18:01.956
It'll give us
enough air

18:01.958 --> 18:04.858
to stay alive
until the rescue.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.993
All contingent,
of course,

18:06.995 --> 18:08.294
on you surviving
the ascent.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.928
I hadn't thought about
that for a second.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.429
Thanks for the reminder.

18:11.431 --> 18:15.266
Okay, exhale slowly and
continuously on your way up.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.568
You won't have to worry about
the bends, because the sub

18:17.570 --> 18:20.337
has the same air pressure
as the surface.

18:20.339 --> 18:22.172
Should be a quick trip up.

18:22.174 --> 18:24.340
You'll have ten minutes
from when you enter the water

18:24.342 --> 18:26.275
until hypothermia
and, uh...

18:26.277 --> 18:27.909
death.

18:32.382 --> 18:35.883
Buck up, kiddo. Didn't you
join the Navy for adventure?

18:59.875 --> 19:02.208
He should be breaking
the surface now.

19:02.210 --> 19:04.043
If he's not, he's drowning.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.317
(gasping)

19:39.044 --> 19:42.545
God... please let this work.

20:09.340 --> 20:13.175
If we don't hear from Cabe soon,
one of us will go up next.

20:13.177 --> 20:14.893
No pressure suits?

20:14.894 --> 20:16.610
I don't like the odds
of making it to the surface.

20:16.613 --> 20:18.579
Versus the odds
of death in here?

20:20.316 --> 20:23.050
We have 40 minutes of air left.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.590
OFFICER:<i> I'm two nautical miles</i>
<i> into the search zone.</i>

20:30.592 --> 20:31.941
Haven't seen anything.

20:31.942 --> 20:33.291
They've been searching
15 minutes

20:33.294 --> 20:35.260
and only covered three percent
of the target zone.

20:35.262 --> 20:37.629
Your coordinates cover
50 square miles of open ocean.

20:37.631 --> 20:38.663
It's gonna take a while.

20:38.665 --> 20:40.297
Toby, you got to narrow it down.

20:40.299 --> 20:41.431
TOBY: We're working
with a half-eaten hoagie

20:41.433 --> 20:42.698
and a piece of chalk.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.266
It's not like
we're mind readers.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.602
What it is like...

20:47.604 --> 20:49.604
is a mini mall.

20:49.606 --> 20:51.572
You have finally gone insane.

20:51.574 --> 20:54.107
No, the video I was watching.

20:54.109 --> 20:55.641
♪ Aw, yeah, come shop ♪

20:55.643 --> 20:57.009
♪ With us ♪

20:57.011 --> 20:58.677
While you were
guessing locations,

20:58.679 --> 21:00.679
I was watching that video.

21:00.681 --> 21:02.647
When you made your
second guess to Walter,

21:02.649 --> 21:04.515
he was singing,
♪ It's just like ♪

21:04.517 --> 21:07.351
♪ It's just like a mini mall. ♪

21:07.353 --> 21:09.619
And when you made your
third and correct guess,

21:09.621 --> 21:11.621
he was saying
living rooms, dinettes.

21:11.623 --> 21:12.688
The time between
those two lyrics

21:12.690 --> 21:14.656
is 14 seconds.

21:14.658 --> 21:16.724
We now know the distance
they traveled between two spots

21:16.726 --> 21:18.759
and how long it took 'em
to cover that ground.

21:18.761 --> 21:20.494
Which gives us their
accurate speed, not a guess.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.661
15.38 knots,

21:21.663 --> 21:23.663
not 20. Walter
overestimated.

21:23.665 --> 21:26.532
Their location is 117.03 west

21:26.534 --> 21:27.633
and 32.05 north.

21:29.169 --> 21:30.468
I'm way out of range
of those new coordinates,

21:30.470 --> 21:32.536
but there is a commercial vessel
in that area.

21:32.538 --> 21:34.337
I'll reach out to them.

21:34.339 --> 21:35.638
Where are you going?

21:35.640 --> 21:37.156
I'm getting us a chopper

21:37.157 --> 21:38.673
and getting us
on that rescue boat.

21:38.676 --> 21:40.509
(beeps)

21:53.757 --> 21:56.023
(deep horn blares)

22:03.799 --> 22:06.065
Help!

22:10.171 --> 22:12.171
(clanging)

22:12.173 --> 22:13.238
Did you hear that?

22:13.240 --> 22:14.672
Cabe.

22:14.674 --> 22:16.640
Oh, that tough
son of a bitch made it.

22:16.642 --> 22:18.675
Thank God.

22:23.114 --> 22:25.481
Sir, phone.

22:27.585 --> 22:29.818
SYLVESTER: Cabe, we can't
believe you're alive.

22:29.820 --> 22:32.187
CABE: We can celebrate later.
If we want to save the others,

22:32.189 --> 22:33.972
we got to work fast.

22:33.973 --> 22:35.756
I need an air tank
the size of a hot water heater,

22:35.759 --> 22:37.425
a winch from a tow truck,

22:37.427 --> 22:40.628
three brass circa 1935-40
electric fans,

22:40.630 --> 22:44.365
a waterproof box,
a GoPro camera,

22:44.367 --> 22:46.133
a 14-inch diameter pipe

22:46.135 --> 22:47.634
and a battery pack.

22:47.636 --> 22:51.604
Real quick-- how did Happy
suggest we get this stuff?

22:53.708 --> 22:55.607
Mr. Quinn.

22:55.609 --> 22:57.275
Fellas. Been a while.

22:57.277 --> 22:59.710
No time to chat.
Happy's in trouble, we need

22:59.712 --> 23:01.712
your help and a load
of equipment.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.714
Starting with the winch
on your tow truck.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.348
We got to move fast.
Paige'll be here

23:05.350 --> 23:06.449
with the chopper in ten minutes.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.417
Chopper?

23:08.419 --> 23:10.152
(tapping)

23:11.455 --> 23:13.588
They don't know
how much longer they can last.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.289
I didn't know
you knew Morse code.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.758
I didn't before I got on
the sub, but I figured it out.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.360
Our time frame for
the oxygen supply

23:20.362 --> 23:22.595
didn't account for the
deeper breathing caused by fear.

23:22.597 --> 23:24.229
I'm ashamed
to say that

23:24.231 --> 23:27.599
my breathing might be
similarly impacted right now.

23:27.601 --> 23:30.835
But somehow...
yours doesn't seem to be.

23:30.837 --> 23:32.236
We're not
military.

23:32.238 --> 23:34.738
We take our orders
from math and science.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.574
Right now we know
the odds of survival are slim,

23:37.576 --> 23:39.842
but we know that mathematically
there's a chance.

23:39.844 --> 23:42.611
Some people
call us robotic,

23:42.613 --> 23:44.746
mechanical.

23:44.748 --> 23:47.381
(tapping resumes)
But in situations like this,

23:47.383 --> 23:49.182
our constitution

23:49.184 --> 23:50.716
is a benefit.

23:56.656 --> 23:58.756
"Still safer than an airplane"?

23:58.758 --> 24:00.691
Why is he
communicating that?

24:00.693 --> 24:02.626
We know subs are safer
because there are

24:02.628 --> 24:05.161
more airplanes in the water
than submarines in the sky.

24:05.163 --> 24:07.663
Why would a submarine be in
the sky? It makes no sense.

24:07.665 --> 24:09.731
Somehow they're
managing to joke.

24:09.733 --> 24:10.865
Humor--

24:10.867 --> 24:12.800
at a time like this--

24:12.802 --> 24:15.169
that isn't something
a captain would normally order.

24:15.171 --> 24:17.171
Not standard
operating procedure.

24:17.173 --> 24:20.541
So strict adherence to protocol
isn't always the best...

24:20.543 --> 24:22.309
tack.

24:22.311 --> 24:23.743
What are you getting at?

24:23.745 --> 24:25.778
An unconventional solution.

24:25.780 --> 24:28.147
Okay.
Uh...

24:28.149 --> 24:29.548
Now, mathematically,
their lives--

24:29.550 --> 24:30.749
yours and Happy's as well--

24:30.751 --> 24:33.852
are collectively
more valuable than mine.

24:33.854 --> 24:35.720
Are the oxygen levels
getting to you now, O'Brien?

24:35.722 --> 24:36.921
If we flood
the chamber

24:36.923 --> 24:38.355
with an exact amount of water,

24:38.357 --> 24:40.223
we can cause the sub
to correct position,

24:40.225 --> 24:41.691
freeing the trapped sailors'
hatch.

24:41.693 --> 24:44.360
Just 18 degrees would be
enough to get the hatch

24:44.362 --> 24:45.594
out of the silt.

24:45.596 --> 24:46.928
The others
have immersion suits--

24:46.930 --> 24:49.563
they could leave via the hatch,
reaching the surface.

24:49.565 --> 24:51.698
This chamber-- the one that
we're in-- is a closed space.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.483
If we flood it
even partially,

24:53.484 --> 24:55.267
the rising water will
compress the air above it.

24:55.270 --> 24:56.702
We breathe in
that compressed air,

24:56.704 --> 24:59.171
we can no longer swim
to the surface like Cabe did.

24:59.173 --> 25:00.338
We'll die from the bends.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.872
We're trapped.
That is right.

25:01.874 --> 25:03.707
We'll need to leave
in a pressurized chamber.

25:03.709 --> 25:05.375
That means waiting
for a sub rescue

25:05.377 --> 25:07.243
that we don't have
enough oxygen to wait for.

25:07.245 --> 25:09.545
That's why we should
make you both improvised suits

25:09.547 --> 25:11.213
like we did for Cabe.
You both leave

25:11.215 --> 25:12.747
and I will flood the chamber.

25:12.749 --> 25:14.582
Nine people escape the boat,

25:14.584 --> 25:16.317
oxygen usage drops,

25:16.319 --> 25:18.652
leaving me
a few more minutes of air.

25:18.654 --> 25:20.787
Anyone could make
the same calculations.

25:20.789 --> 25:22.789
I don't think anyone else makes
that calculation, and you still

25:22.791 --> 25:24.857
won't have enough air to keep
you alive until rescue comes.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.726
In order to flood
this compartment

25:26.727 --> 25:28.594
with the exact amount of water,
you need to close

25:28.596 --> 25:31.396
the hatch, too. That is
a two-person job. I'm staying.

25:31.398 --> 25:33.431
No. I can figure out a way to get it...
I'm staying.

25:33.433 --> 25:36.600
And you'll need a Navy person
to work the locking device.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.635
It's really a three-person job.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.771
Three of us

25:41.773 --> 25:44.940
working together maximizes
the odds of success.

25:44.942 --> 25:47.375
(helicopter blades whirring)

25:47.377 --> 25:49.343
How did my quiet day
turn into this?

25:49.345 --> 25:50.644
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.

25:56.685 --> 25:57.984
When the water gets
to this level,

25:57.986 --> 26:00.419
we close the hatch,

26:00.421 --> 26:01.987
okay?

26:06.293 --> 26:07.492
Ready?

26:07.494 --> 26:08.693
Okay.

26:08.695 --> 26:11.362
One, two...

26:11.364 --> 26:12.796
(grunts)

26:19.804 --> 26:22.437
Damn it! Not good.

26:22.439 --> 26:24.539
That's just what Happy says.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.741
(all grunting)

26:26.743 --> 26:29.376
Come on.

26:31.813 --> 26:33.813
Lean into it!

26:33.815 --> 26:35.881
(grunting)

26:44.357 --> 26:46.623
Not smooth, but effective.

26:46.625 --> 26:49.492
I hope so. I had to guess
the silt density.

26:57.968 --> 27:00.601
(laughs)
We're shifting.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.873
Whoa! (laughs) (tapping)

27:10.945 --> 27:13.378
It worked!

27:15.915 --> 27:18.882
Their hatch is clear.

27:18.884 --> 27:20.383
"Thank you.

27:20.385 --> 27:21.951
And Godspeed."

27:23.854 --> 27:25.854
I have to agree
that personality-wise

27:25.856 --> 27:29.624
you don't seem too similar.
She can be very, uh, rigid.

27:29.626 --> 27:31.559
She was chatty
when she was really young.

27:31.561 --> 27:32.693
She was talking
in full sentences

27:32.695 --> 27:35.462
at seven months old.
I got her

27:35.464 --> 27:37.997
a dollhouse
when she wasn't even three yet.

27:37.999 --> 27:40.933
She put in her own wiring
with working lights.

27:40.935 --> 27:42.668
I was terrified
it was gonna be a fire hazard.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.936
I... pulled them all out.

27:44.938 --> 27:48.372
Next day,
she rewired it.

27:48.374 --> 27:49.840
Had to take it away.

27:49.842 --> 27:53.677
That's about
when she started getting quiet.

27:53.679 --> 27:55.478
I should've just let her do
what she was gonna do.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.946
(grunts)

27:57.915 --> 28:00.548
You like my daughter, don't you?

28:00.550 --> 28:03.017
I love your daughter.

28:03.019 --> 28:05.019
All right.

28:05.021 --> 28:08.088
Then just let her do
what she's gonna do.

28:10.559 --> 28:12.358
One more
should do it.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.026
Thank you.
You okay?

28:14.028 --> 28:16.395
(sighs)
Honestly?

28:16.397 --> 28:17.596
No.

28:17.598 --> 28:18.930
This is my first day
on the field.

28:18.932 --> 28:20.598
I'm in the middle
of the ocean,

28:20.600 --> 28:22.733
on a trawler,
trying to save lives.

28:22.735 --> 28:23.867
It just might be

28:23.869 --> 28:26.636
too big a first bite
for a desk jockey.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.038
Before Scorpion,
I was a waitress.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.740
Feeling overwhelmed
is part of the job,

28:31.742 --> 28:33.742
but it's a job
I learned I can handle.

28:33.744 --> 28:34.976
You'll learn, too.

28:35.912 --> 28:37.878
Guys?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
JONES:
Yes! Yes!

28:39.882 --> 28:41.781
(whoops)

28:41.783 --> 28:44.950
Either the ocean is lousy
with mermen or those

28:44.952 --> 28:46.618
are our submariners!

28:46.620 --> 28:48.653
Get these men out of the water!

28:50.390 --> 28:52.089
(tapping)

28:56.662 --> 28:58.662
The crew made it.

28:58.664 --> 29:01.097
WALTER: Hopefully your
tank's on its way, Happy.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.966
So now our lives
are in Toby's hands.

29:04.968 --> 29:06.901
(panting)

29:06.903 --> 29:07.968
Fantastic.

29:13.575 --> 29:14.941
SYLVESTER: They're still stuck
down there without enough oxygen.

29:14.943 --> 29:16.642
Three people use six liters
per minute,

29:16.644 --> 29:18.110
seven if they're stressed,
which, of course, they are.

29:18.112 --> 29:21.646
There are 122 liters of oxygen
left, which is 17 minutes,

29:21.648 --> 29:23.147
give or take a few seconds.
Rescue sub's

29:23.149 --> 29:25.616
35 minutes out. The
tank that we made

29:25.618 --> 29:27.151
gives them 45 minutes of oxygen.

29:27.152 --> 29:28.685
If this works,
it saves their lives.

29:29.921 --> 29:31.687
We're hooked up!

29:31.689 --> 29:32.821
Let's go!

29:33.790 --> 29:35.389
(whirring)

29:39.961 --> 29:42.628
Dear God, let this work.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.705
There it is!

30:00.646 --> 30:03.413
My daughter's in there.

30:03.415 --> 30:05.915
In case we don't make it out
of here,

30:05.917 --> 30:07.583
I just want to say

30:07.585 --> 30:10.452
I'm not really a robot.

30:10.454 --> 30:11.853
Thank you for clarifying.

30:11.855 --> 30:15.489
I did know you weren't made
of circuitry.

30:15.491 --> 30:17.991
We both play
a good game of denial.

30:17.993 --> 30:20.193
It might be the one thing
where I can beat you,

30:20.195 --> 30:22.495
but...

30:24.098 --> 30:28.433
...right now my dad is up there
trying to save me.

30:28.435 --> 30:32.536
A man I've been looking for
for 25 years.

30:33.472 --> 30:35.638
I just never expected

30:35.640 --> 30:39.041
to want to live as badly
as I do right now.

30:41.812 --> 30:44.946
I saved nine sailors' lives
instead of us.

30:44.948 --> 30:47.615
I... supported that act

30:47.617 --> 30:49.817
with calculations.

30:49.819 --> 30:52.820
But perhaps
there was...

30:52.822 --> 30:55.756
some sentimentality attached.

30:55.758 --> 30:57.457
And, uh,

30:57.459 --> 31:00.460
you let that certifiable lunatic

31:00.462 --> 31:02.462
stay in our garage.

31:02.464 --> 31:04.597
(chuckles)

31:04.599 --> 31:06.665
Uh...

31:08.935 --> 31:10.935
Maybe we're changing.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.771
Maybe...

31:13.773 --> 31:16.640
maybe I'm not a robot either.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.811
You're not normal people,
are you?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.879
(creaking)

31:25.883 --> 31:28.683
Greetings submerged.
Toby Curtis here,

31:28.685 --> 31:30.251
talking to you underwater.

31:30.253 --> 31:32.886
If you can hear me,
open the sub's garbage chute.

31:32.888 --> 31:35.121
We're connecting
an oxygen tank now.

31:35.123 --> 31:37.490
So, if you feel a little bump,
that's just us.

31:37.492 --> 31:39.492
If you can't hear me,
it means you're already dead.

31:39.494 --> 31:40.993
SYLVESTER:
Don't say that.

31:40.995 --> 31:43.061
Oh, God. TOBY: If they're
goners, whatever I say

31:43.063 --> 31:44.162
won't mean a poot.

31:44.164 --> 31:45.530
SYLVESTER:
You're still recording.

31:45.532 --> 31:48.032
Okay, you heard him.
Yeah, let's get to it.

31:48.034 --> 31:49.933
Okay, I don't see
the disposal unit opening.

31:49.935 --> 31:52.769
Come on!

31:52.771 --> 31:53.936
There!

31:53.938 --> 31:56.071
Forward!

31:56.073 --> 31:57.238
Now!

31:57.240 --> 31:59.573
(door clacks open)

31:59.575 --> 32:00.941
They did it!

32:02.277 --> 32:06.512
I have never been so
happy to smell garbage.

32:06.514 --> 32:10.215
Ah, some nice solders there.
Wiring's not great.

32:10.217 --> 32:12.000
A good sized tank.

32:12.001 --> 32:13.784
Overall, I'd rate the
craftsmanship as pretty good.

32:13.787 --> 32:15.086
Okay, so, how big's the tank?

32:15.088 --> 32:17.555
About eight feet by three feet.

32:17.557 --> 32:20.024
Can we use this tank
as a getaway vehicle?

32:20.026 --> 32:21.759
There's not enough propulsion
with the three of us in it.

32:21.761 --> 32:24.161
The tank would never even
make it to the surface.

32:24.163 --> 32:26.263
It would just sit
there, suspended

32:26.265 --> 32:28.599
about 100 feet
off the bottom.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.934
Yeah, but the tank gives us
298 cubic liters of 20% oxygen.

32:30.936 --> 32:33.736
Should be enough
for about 45 more minutes.

32:33.738 --> 32:36.805
(sniffing)
Something wrong?

32:36.807 --> 32:38.740
The-the-the...
the air.

32:38.742 --> 32:40.942
Smells like the fridge
in our garage.

32:40.944 --> 32:42.276
It's sulfur.

32:42.278 --> 32:44.177
I thought it was coming
from the trash,

32:44.179 --> 32:46.045
but it's not. It's coming from
underneath this compartment.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.813
It's lead/acid batteries. The
seawater must have leaked in,

32:47.815 --> 32:49.748
caused a chemical reaction
that produced sulfur.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.182
Ah, the sulfur's
not the problem.

32:51.184 --> 32:53.551
The same reaction
could also produce chloride.

32:53.553 --> 32:54.885
That's the problem.

32:54.887 --> 32:58.321
What are you doing?

32:58.323 --> 33:00.589
Walter's right.

33:00.591 --> 33:02.223
It's chloride.
Okay.

33:02.225 --> 33:03.958
I've been around
enough batteries to know

33:03.960 --> 33:05.726
breathing in that stuff
will dissolve your lungs.

33:05.728 --> 33:08.595
Okay, so, we don't have
45 minutes anymore.

33:08.597 --> 33:10.330
It's more like five.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.667
Okay, sailor,

33:14.669 --> 33:16.035
we're down, but we're not out!

33:18.572 --> 33:20.405
Ensign?
What are you going?

33:20.406 --> 33:22.239
There's a very specific
protocol on this sub.

33:22.242 --> 33:23.341
Self-destruct?

33:23.343 --> 33:25.042
If our enemies capture this sub,

33:25.044 --> 33:26.643
its technology could be used
to kill thousands

33:26.645 --> 33:28.311
of Americans or our allies.

33:28.313 --> 33:30.313
In the event
that the craft is disabled,

33:30.315 --> 33:32.048
the last officer on board has
to initiate the sequence.

33:32.050 --> 33:33.983
HAPPY:
But the Navy's on their way.

33:33.984 --> 33:35.917
They'll recover the ship.
Yeah, but what if they can't?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.352
What if they run
into logistical problems,

33:37.354 --> 33:38.820
which is very possible?

33:38.821 --> 33:40.287
What if whoever planted
the device that we came here for

33:40.290 --> 33:42.323
tries to get it
as soon as we leave?

33:42.325 --> 33:43.657
That's why
the protocol's in place,

33:43.659 --> 33:45.291
and that's why
we have to follow it.

33:45.293 --> 33:49.795
What's the maximum countdown
for the self-destruct protocol?

33:49.797 --> 33:51.129
Maximum five minutes.

33:51.131 --> 33:52.763
Initiate countdown.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.364
In five minutes, either

33:54.366 --> 33:58.101
the air fills with
poison, or we explode.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.938
(alarm blaring)

34:01.940 --> 34:04.807
Guess we got to get out
of here in four and a half.

34:11.148 --> 34:13.148
(alarm sounding) HAPPY: Walt,

34:13.150 --> 34:14.783
we've got less
than a minute now.

34:14.784 --> 34:16.417
This is when you normally think
of something brilliant,

34:16.418 --> 34:18.051
so how's that coming?!

34:20.222 --> 34:23.056
An escape pod.

34:23.058 --> 34:25.825
The oxygen tank could be used
as an escape pod.

34:25.827 --> 34:27.527
I asked for brilliant.

34:27.528 --> 34:29.228
I already told you there's
too many bodies for buoyancy.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.280
We're just sit gonna
there in the water.

34:31.281 --> 34:33.331
Yeah, normally we would, but
in our present circumstances,

34:33.334 --> 34:35.334
we're likely to be propelled
upward from the blast.

34:35.336 --> 34:36.719
You really think

34:36.720 --> 34:38.103
we can ride the explosion
of this submarine?

34:38.105 --> 34:40.638
Yes.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.406
Maybe. I don't know.
Or we die.

34:42.408 --> 34:44.207
Okay, look, get
up the trash chute

34:44.209 --> 34:46.375
and into the tank.
Come on, Happy, let's go.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.243
(grunting)

34:48.245 --> 34:50.878
Go. Go.
(grunting)

34:50.880 --> 34:53.947
It's not gonna be comfortable.

34:53.949 --> 34:56.349
Okay, you go.

34:56.351 --> 34:58.651
I need to make sure
the ship goes down.

34:58.653 --> 34:59.919
So you're gonna rigidly adhere

34:59.920 --> 35:01.186
to the rules even if it
costs you your life?!

35:01.188 --> 35:03.388
It's my duty.
Your duty is to save

35:03.390 --> 35:05.690
as many lives as possible.
That includes your own.

35:05.692 --> 35:09.126
Okay? Okay?!

35:09.128 --> 35:10.894
Okay, okay. You first.

35:10.896 --> 35:12.428
All right.

35:12.430 --> 35:13.762
Okay.

35:13.764 --> 35:15.430
(grunts)

35:15.432 --> 35:18.098
(panting)

35:21.169 --> 35:22.801
Come on! Come on!

35:22.803 --> 35:25.937
I don't fit!

35:25.939 --> 35:27.805
Come on.
Okay, just relax.

35:27.807 --> 35:29.907
Relax? Why?

35:29.909 --> 35:31.742
It's an out-of-the-box solution,
and it may sting a little.

35:31.744 --> 35:33.944
(crack)  Aah! Yeah.

35:33.946 --> 35:35.679
Aah! You can fit
through the hole now.

35:35.681 --> 35:37.047
Oh!

35:37.049 --> 35:40.717
All right, Happy,
get us out of here.

35:40.719 --> 35:42.819
Just reversing the spin
on these fans!

35:42.821 --> 35:44.420
Any way we can go any faster?

35:44.422 --> 35:46.889
No. Now shut up
and brace yourself.

35:46.891 --> 35:48.891
(coughing)

35:54.398 --> 35:57.766
Just talked
to the rescue sub.

35:57.768 --> 35:59.200
Ten minutes out.

35:59.202 --> 36:01.868
(seagulls cawing)

36:03.738 --> 36:06.705
(explosion)

36:06.707 --> 36:09.106
(water gurgling)

36:11.243 --> 36:13.176
Oh, no.

36:13.178 --> 36:14.911
Happy.

36:21.352 --> 36:25.087
Cabe, tell me this
didn't just happen.

36:29.359 --> 36:31.926
HAPPY:
Hey, dummies!

36:31.928 --> 36:33.794
A little help?!

36:33.796 --> 36:36.363
They're alive.

36:36.365 --> 36:37.731
Thank God.

36:39.768 --> 36:42.769
Couldn't have done it
without you, desk jockey.

36:53.514 --> 36:56.747
Good work, fellas.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.417
I just wanted to
say, uh, thank you.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.819
You know, you're
a... you're a hero.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.454
Well, I'm not a hero.
It's just math.

37:06.456 --> 37:08.989
I don't know. One thing
I've learned about you is

37:08.991 --> 37:11.825
you don't always
live by the numbers.

37:11.827 --> 37:14.294
Sometimes you trust yourself,
believe in your team

37:14.296 --> 37:15.862
despite the numbers.

37:15.864 --> 37:19.332
There's another
variable in there

37:19.334 --> 37:21.500
that you're not copping to.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.410
Hey.

37:32.412 --> 37:36.847
Let's go downstairs.
I want to show you something.

37:39.818 --> 37:43.152
TOBY:
There he is. Big Ray!

37:43.154 --> 37:44.286
Where you been?

37:44.288 --> 37:45.520
I just hitchhiked from Gardena.

37:45.522 --> 37:47.054
TOBY: Whoa.
RAY: Yeah, I guess

37:47.056 --> 37:49.823
I'm not normally a person
people stop for, so...

37:49.825 --> 37:51.825
Ray? Hi.

37:51.827 --> 37:53.493
Hey.
I'm...

37:53.495 --> 37:54.978
Excuse me, fellas.

37:54.979 --> 37:56.462
Ray, I'm sorry I ditched
you this morning.

37:56.464 --> 37:58.297
We... It was an emergency.

37:58.298 --> 38:00.131
Not a problem. In fact,
I saved you a doughnut.

38:00.134 --> 38:02.267
Here.
Oh.

38:02.269 --> 38:04.252
Still hungry.
I just...

38:04.253 --> 38:06.236
Thanks. Um, how about I,
um... I get you a burger?

38:06.239 --> 38:07.304
Please sit. Yeah?

38:07.306 --> 38:08.972
A burger?
Want to sit down?

38:08.974 --> 38:10.473
Yeah, sounds great.

38:10.475 --> 38:12.308
Makes up for a 22-mile walk.

38:17.314 --> 38:20.948
Sure, it's not as nice
as the one you had, but...

38:20.950 --> 38:23.517
thought you and I could
restore it together?

38:25.320 --> 38:27.453
I'll be your apprentice.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.891
Like the list
you sent from the sub?

38:32.893 --> 38:35.260
I did a good job following
the instructions, right?

38:39.499 --> 38:41.499
It's something
we could do together

38:41.501 --> 38:43.567
with our clothes on.

38:46.471 --> 38:49.305
Do not... shrink me.

38:49.307 --> 38:51.006
And I am not very comfortable

38:51.008 --> 38:53.375
with you having in-depth
conversations with my father.

38:53.377 --> 38:57.412
I'm just making an effort
to be a good friend.

39:14.864 --> 39:16.563
If I tell you
to get me a 3/8 wrench,

39:16.565 --> 39:19.198
and you get a 5/16,
I will hit you with it.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.433
Deal.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.504
So wait a minute.

39:27.506 --> 39:31.207
You're-you're going to
college and you're ten?

39:31.209 --> 39:32.975
I know we've got
our marching orders

39:32.977 --> 39:35.344
from Cooper
regarding Ray.

39:35.346 --> 39:38.347
But... I learned a bit

39:38.349 --> 39:40.415
about following
orders today--

39:40.417 --> 39:45.086
about being robotic is not
always the best course.

39:45.088 --> 39:48.422
Well, despite what Cooper said,

39:48.424 --> 39:52.192
I don't think she's the kind
of person who'd mind.

39:54.296 --> 39:57.230
Ensign Nathan said that he felt
there was a variable within me

39:57.232 --> 40:01.267
that makes me not as, uh,
logical as I think I am.

40:01.269 --> 40:06.672
I'm not sure I agree, but,
uh, I have noticed that

40:06.674 --> 40:10.409
some of my decision-making
isn't the same as it used to be.

40:10.411 --> 40:14.079
I'm trying to determine
what's causing the shift.

40:14.081 --> 40:15.647
Any theories?

40:15.649 --> 40:19.117
Contact with humanity.

40:19.119 --> 40:23.354
It's confusing.

40:23.356 --> 40:26.156
I made a decision today

40:26.158 --> 40:30.093
that saved nine people's
lives by lying.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.929
I always thought that
emotional decisions

40:32.931 --> 40:36.999
might compromise
Scorpion's survival,

40:37.001 --> 40:40.067
but today they
led to survival.

40:42.237 --> 40:45.471
Maybe it's worth,
uh, rethinking

40:45.473 --> 40:49.074
other conclusions that
I've come to regarding

40:49.076 --> 40:52.710
avoiding... emotions.

40:52.712 --> 40:54.678
RALPH:
Mom!

40:54.680 --> 40:57.380
I decided this is the class
I want-- Robotics.

40:57.382 --> 40:58.915
It makes the most sense
to start out

40:58.916 --> 41:00.449
with something logical
and uncomplicated.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.421
I think, uh...

41:06.423 --> 41:09.056
I think he's right.

41:09.058 --> 41:12.492
Robotics is the smart
choice... for now.

41:12.494 --> 41:14.460
Robotics it is.

41:14.462 --> 41:17.129
Uh, but not
for everything.
