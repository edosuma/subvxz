Oh, my God.
I can't watch this.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.137
Just tell me what's going on.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.183
[door creaking]

00:13.839 --> 00:15.885
Jake!Screw you, H&R Block!

00:18.583 --> 00:20.411
Babe, you are
falling asleep again.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.586
Why don't we just go upstairs?

00:21.630 --> 00:23.501
No. No way.
Claire... [sighs]

00:23.545 --> 00:25.547
...we are living with a
world-famous pop star.

00:25.590 --> 00:29.029
We cannot let him see us
go to sleep at... 9:25.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.075
Well, it can't be worse
than the time

00:32.119 --> 00:34.425
that he saw us high-five
over a coupon.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.996
Okay, uh, we clearly have
no choice here but...

00:40.040 --> 00:42.564
to get super into cocaine.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.088
This, coming from the guy
who legitimately thought

00:45.132 --> 00:47.786
he was becoming a chocoholic?

00:47.830 --> 00:50.398
You have no idea what I
almost did for a Snickers.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.313
You know what?

00:52.356 --> 00:53.705
This is our house,
all right?

00:53.749 --> 00:56.056
We get to decide when
it's time to go to bed.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.015
And it's time to go
to bed right now.Thank you.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.539
I'm sick of this, man,
tiptoeing around here.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.975
We going to sleep,
all right?

01:03.019 --> 01:04.890
Hi guys.Oh, hey, hey,
what you doing

01:04.934 --> 01:07.067
turning off the lights, girl?
We're staying up all night.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.765
What's wrong with you?

01:09.808 --> 01:11.332
What's up, man?

01:11.375 --> 01:14.074
Not much. My stuff's getting
delivered to the house tomorrow,

01:14.117 --> 01:15.292
so I thought
I'd head to bed early.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.164
Oh. God. Thank God.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.426
[laughs][whoops]

01:18.469 --> 01:20.080
Okay, we are also
going to bed,

01:20.123 --> 01:21.733
but we didn't want to say
anything, 'cause we were

01:21.777 --> 01:23.431
afraid you'd think
we're losers.Yeah.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.128
No way. Bed is awesome.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.000
In fact, we should all
head up there together.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.830
Well... [laughs]
No, no.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.049
No. We...

01:33.093 --> 01:35.138
No. Right? No.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.923
Ah, uh, Coops,
we're very flattered,

01:37.967 --> 01:40.143
and we wish we could say
that was the first time

01:40.187 --> 01:41.579
someone asked us
to sleep with them...

01:41.623 --> 01:44.626
Yeah, we misread
a Craigslist ad.Yeah.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.454
But, as handsome

01:46.497 --> 01:49.892
as we both find you,
that's just not on the table.

01:49.935 --> 01:53.025
[laughs]
Not gonna share my Claire.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.419
Are we talking
about Bed, the nightclub?

01:55.463 --> 01:58.118
Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no.No.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.337
Okay. Well,
have a great sleep, guys.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.991
Hey, just because
we're going to bed doesn't mean

02:02.034 --> 02:03.253
we're going to sleep.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.125
We about to do it.
[chuckles]

02:05.168 --> 02:08.084

and, uh, any exotic animals
can just chill in the backyard.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.713
I put out bowls of water.

But wait.
Isn't there more?

Nope.

Hey.Got your stuff.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.444
Aw, sick.

03:47.488 --> 03:50.186
Yeah. Uh, is this one box
seriously everything you own?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.275
Yeah, man, what happened
to all your other stuff?

03:52.319 --> 03:54.451
You know, your Grammys,
your Rolling Stonearticles,

03:54.495 --> 03:58.107
that wax sculpture that made
you look like Angela Lansbury?

03:58.150 --> 03:59.674
Yeah, I got rid of all that.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.198
Now the only things I take
with me are my guitar and this.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.460
[sniffles]
It's the last photo I took

04:03.504 --> 04:05.157
with my family
before I moved out of home.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.203
Oh, what a cutie.[chuckles]

04:07.247 --> 04:10.772
Wow. I've never seen a
ten-year-old with a six pack.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.209
And since I've moved around
so much over the years,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.342
it's always been easier
to be a minimalist.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.995
So you just
throw everything away?

04:17.039 --> 04:19.346
Yeah, I, uh... I scrub it all.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.912
Do you guys know
what I mean by "scrubbing"?

04:20.956 --> 04:24.046
Who me? Yeah,
dude, of course.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.309
I love to scrub.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.659
Scrub-a-dub-dub.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.008
But, just so Claire
doesn't feel left out,

04:30.052 --> 04:31.967
why don't you bounce
it her way, you know?

04:32.010 --> 04:33.577
So, whenever I move in
to a new place...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.797
Later, old place.I get rid
of all my old stuff.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.538
[high-pitched]:
To the curb, y'all.Yeah, it's best

04:37.581 --> 04:39.061
just to let that stuff go,
'cause

04:39.104 --> 04:40.323
I don't need things from...

04:40.367 --> 04:41.977

of who I am.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.720
And that, young lady,
is what scrubbing is.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.809
You see, because
me-- me and Coops--

04:47.852 --> 04:48.984
we get rid of everything,

04:49.027 --> 04:50.768
because the past is
not what defines us.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.248
CLAIRE:
Jake, you are literally

04:52.292 --> 04:54.816
surrounded by boxes
of your old crap.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.600
This? This isn't crap.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.254
This is all the stuff from
my past that defines me.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.257
I am so sorry, Cooper,
that you have been

05:01.301 --> 05:02.824
living up here like this.
I'm sure,

05:02.867 --> 05:05.348
as a minimalist,
being around all this junk

05:05.392 --> 05:06.741
is driving you nuts.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.656
Nah, it's actually refreshing.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.222
People are always
cleaning up after me,

05:10.266 --> 05:12.399
but you guys don't even feel
society's pressure

05:12.442 --> 05:14.488
to clean up after yourselves.[Jake laughs]

05:14.531 --> 05:16.141
Ouch.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.534
You know, we will
have this place scrubbed

05:17.578 --> 05:18.927
by the end of the day.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.321
'Cause, I mean, we do not need
to keep copies

05:21.364 --> 05:23.845
of all the letters that
you wrote to Scottie Pippen.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.150
No, no, no,
we need to keep those,

05:25.194 --> 05:26.848
because he literally
wrote back to every one.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.416

Okay. "Dear"--

05:29.459 --> 05:31.635
different font--
"...Jake,

05:31.679 --> 05:34.769
"Thanks for your letter
and/or drawing.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.727
"Keep on trippin' for Pippen.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.643
"Pat Lemieux,
attorney for Scottie Pippen.

"P.S.: this letter
does not reflect the views

05:41.993 --> 05:43.038
of Scottie Pippen."

05:43.081 --> 05:45.170
Yeah.Come on, Jake, it's dangerous

05:45.214 --> 05:46.737
for him to sleep
up here like this.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.173
Oh, nonsense.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.481
My stuff is organized
and stacked meticulously.

06:03.232 --> 06:06.409
Okay, obviously, I will get rid
of the bowling ball.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.411
[creaking]

06:12.459 --> 06:14.199
[coughs]

06:14.243 --> 06:16.201
So, as I was saying,

06:16.245 --> 06:18.334
I will have this place scrubbed
by the end of the day.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.561
Hey, babe.
How's the scrubbing going?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.171
Oh, great.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.433
I'm realizing
all my stuff is awesome,

06:30.477 --> 06:31.739
and I'm never
getting rid of any of it.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.699
Come on, there's got to be stuff
in here that you don't need.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.137
Okay, Cooper doesn't
keep his real Grammys,

06:39.181 --> 06:42.184
and this is a fake Grammy
that you won

06:42.227 --> 06:45.187
for best karaoke
at your office Christmas Party.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.973
[singsongy]:
Keeping it.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.933
Well, you definitely don't need

06:51.976 --> 06:53.848
this old plastic basketball.

06:53.891 --> 06:57.025
Well, is it just an old
plastic basketball, Claire,

06:57.068 --> 07:00.158
or is it two basket-bowls?
[laughs]

07:00.202 --> 07:02.596
Oh, my God,
there's guacamole...

07:02.639 --> 07:05.381
[gags] There's still
guacamole in this.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.688
[gags]

07:07.731 --> 07:09.341
Knock, knock.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.821
[scoffs]
Mom, you can't say
"knock knock"

07:10.865 --> 07:12.257
when you're already
in the house.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.476
JAKE:
Wow, uh,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
you two are dressed
an awful lot alike.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.001
Yeah, whenever I buy a
shirt for myself online,

07:17.045 --> 07:19.351
I always click on the
men's version as well.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.266
Ah.GERALD:
It's a great system for us,

07:21.310 --> 07:23.530
'cause we have the same style.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.967
Forever 51.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.103
Come on.
You two, this is getting crazy.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.757
You don't just dress alike.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.281
You also split every meal and
you watch all the same shows.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.240
And it is perfectly natural

07:38.283 --> 07:40.285
for a couple to merge
together over time.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.375
You know, just like... like
Daddy's chest and back hair.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.424
It'll happen to you, too.
Before you know it,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.208
Claire and Jake
will cease to exist,

07:50.252 --> 07:51.645
and in its place will be...

07:51.688 --> 07:52.950
...Clake.Clake.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.386
Yes!
[laughs]

07:54.430 --> 07:55.910
Jinx.Jinx.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.303
Love you.Love you.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.696
Booga booga!Booga booga!

07:59.740 --> 08:01.829
[both laughing]

08:01.872 --> 08:04.396
[both sigh]

08:04.440 --> 08:05.789
You know, it
is horrifying

08:05.833 --> 08:07.487
to see the two of them
combined into one person.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.489
Uh, well,
technically, that's me.

08:13.231 --> 08:16.191
But I... I understand
what you mean.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.541
And don't worry.
We are a young, cool couple.

08:18.585 --> 08:22.066
We are nowhere near unisex
shopping at Tommy Bahama.

08:23.633 --> 08:27.028
So are you guys finally getting
rid of all your old junk?

08:27.071 --> 08:28.551
Uh, well,
it's actually just me.

08:28.595 --> 08:29.944
I have trouble
throwing things out.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.380
Doesn't seem to be
a problem with Claire.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.816
[both laughing]

08:32.860 --> 08:34.383
What? What?
What's funny?

08:34.426 --> 08:35.645
What-what are
we laughing at?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.429
Claire holds on to
plenty of stuff.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.866
She just does it
in plain sight.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.868
No, I-I... I do not.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.478
Oh, really?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.872
Do you see that "art"
on the wall?

08:44.915 --> 08:46.830
Yeah, it's a... Claire told me
it was a Banksy print.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.703
Yeah, if Banksy
secretly worked at Kinko's.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.533
That's just a collage
of all of her

08:53.576 --> 08:54.534
old concert tickets.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.623
Wait a minute.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.625
Wait. Claire,
you lied to me,

08:58.668 --> 09:01.105
andyou saw Incubus
this many times?

09:02.629 --> 09:03.847
And what's in here?

09:03.891 --> 09:05.414
That's the, uh,
china Claire said

09:05.457 --> 09:06.720
we're saving for
a special occasion.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.592
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No.
Okay, Jake, Jake, stop, stop.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.594
Stop. I-I...

09:11.638 --> 09:14.597
I need you to trust me.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.251
Aw, Claire-bear.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.035
That's what the
villain says.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.995
Oh, look what
we have here.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.606
Old, ratty concert
T-shirts, uh,

09:23.650 --> 09:25.173
and some mix tapes.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.610
We got... Oh, my gosh.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.657
What in the Bride
of Chucky is this?

09:32.006 --> 09:34.835
It's Rebethany.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.666
That is her terrifying
childhood doll.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.669
Ugh. Rebethany.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.322
[in high-pitched voice]:
No one can love Claire

09:44.366 --> 09:47.195
like I love Claire.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.762
[growling]JAKE: Oh, God.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.287
The funny thing is,
we never even bought it.

09:52.330 --> 09:55.072
It just... showed up one day.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.381
Face it-- you both have
a bit of a hoarding problem.

09:59.424 --> 10:00.687
Now, come on, honey.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.602
We have to go
to the bathroom.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.912
Now, that is scarier
than your doll.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.920
All right, so here's the plan.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.401
If we don't still use it,
we lose it.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.838
If we ain't playin',
it ain't stayin'.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.407
If it has no purpose, then we...

10:25.450 --> 10:27.235
Uh, uh, we, uh...

10:27.278 --> 10:29.498
We just put it
in the throw pile.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.108
We put it in the...Yeah. Okay.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.414
So...

10:32.457 --> 10:35.112
All right, well, this
is a definite throw.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.375
Yoink. That is...

10:37.419 --> 10:38.681
a definite keep, all right?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.814
This is my rec jersey,
all right?

10:40.857 --> 10:42.685
What... Oh, you still wear that?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.556
I use it as motivation

10:44.600 --> 10:46.210
to get back
to my original weight.

10:49.518 --> 10:50.780
What original weight,

10:50.824 --> 10:54.697
eight pounds, seven ounces?

10:54.741 --> 10:57.091
It's form-fitting,
Claire, all right?

10:57.134 --> 10:59.833
Stop focusing on my sexy jersey
and focus on, uh,

10:59.876 --> 11:02.618
scrubbing this creature
from my nightmares.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.100
Hey, hey. I can't
get rid of Rebethany.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.710
Both my parents
always worked late,

11:07.754 --> 11:10.060
and she was the only one who
would listen to music with me.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.063
["London Bridge" playing eerily]Wherever you go,

11:13.107 --> 11:16.284
I'll be there.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.938
I'm starting to understand

11:17.981 --> 11:19.504
why you guys had
so many house fires.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.901
Okay, well, what is this
giant elastic band for,

11:24.945 --> 11:26.947
really big
accounting documents?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.122
Claire, if you must know,

11:28.165 --> 11:31.125
this is my Elasta-blaster
Exercise Band.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.561
Allow me to demonstrate.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.912
I simply put this in the wedge
of the door, right,

11:35.956 --> 11:37.435
close said door,

11:37.479 --> 11:39.655
put it around said body,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.310
and, oh,
look at all that resistance.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.007
Huh?
Look at that.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.400
See, back when I played
college ball,

11:45.443 --> 11:47.097
this is how I used to explode
through the lane.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.751
I'd be like... [grunts]
And I'd be like...

11:48.795 --> 11:50.013
[grunts]

11:50.057 --> 11:52.407
[grunting]

11:54.496 --> 11:56.280
And it's a great way to practice
being held back in a fight.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.674
Be like, "What?
What you talkin' 'bout? No, no,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.328
"no, no, no.
Eliot,

12:00.371 --> 12:02.591
"let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him, Eliot.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.549
"I just want to talk to him.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.073
"Huh? What?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.291
I'm-a kill him.
I'm gonna kill him."

12:07.335 --> 12:10.251
[shouts]

12:11.513 --> 12:12.470
Hey, what's up, Coops?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.298
Hey.When did you get here?

12:14.342 --> 12:15.517
What are you guys doing?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.475
Uh, we are trying
to scrub our old stuff,

12:17.519 --> 12:19.477
but it's harder than we thought
to let go.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.783
It can be tough.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
Maybe the lyrics
from my latest single can help.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.091
Oh, we love that song.Mm.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.571
♪ Don't let the past

12:26.615 --> 12:28.660
♪ Define who you are

12:28.704 --> 12:30.924
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

12:30.967 --> 12:33.448
♪ Shake that booty,
yeah, yeah. ♪

12:39.367 --> 12:42.413
You're probably just talking
about that first line, huh?Mm-hmm.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
Yeah, I've always thought
that if you hold on to the past

12:44.633 --> 12:46.591
too tight,
you'll never be ready to embrace

12:46.635 --> 12:47.984
who you are in the future.

12:48.028 --> 12:51.118
Well, you are the most
successful person we know.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.120
And maybe we are holding
ourselves back

12:53.163 --> 12:55.122
by hanging on
to all these memories.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.559
Yeah, I guess we could
get rid of some of this stuff.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.735
If it helps, there's an old
Australian proverb that says

12:59.779 --> 13:01.868
if you throw something away
and you're meant to have it,

13:01.911 --> 13:03.565
it'll boomerang back to you.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.394
That's funny. [grunts]
I have a Nerf Boomerang theory:

13:06.437 --> 13:08.613
that everything
will end up on the roof.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.399
Well, thanks, Cooper.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.835
[chuckles]
Does it work?

13:12.879 --> 13:15.098
Totally. I once threw this shirt
out at a concert,

13:15.142 --> 13:17.274
and, the very next night,
a beautiful woman came up

13:17.318 --> 13:19.059
to my hotel room
and returned it to me.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.670
She gave me my own shirt
right off her back.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.498
That... Wait a minute.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.500
[chuckles]

13:25.543 --> 13:28.590
What did she wear
in the hotel room?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.418
Oh.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.988
She was topless.Yeah.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.467
She had her b...

13:36.511 --> 13:38.948
Yo.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.647
Claire-bear!

13:42.691 --> 13:43.997
[chuckles]

13:44.040 --> 13:45.085
I'm back from Goodwill,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.826
and we are officially scrubbed.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.088
CLAIRE:
How'd it go, babe?

13:48.131 --> 13:49.089
Oh, it was fine,

13:49.132 --> 13:50.525
though there was a weird moment

13:50.568 --> 13:52.527
when Rebethany
slid out of her box

13:52.570 --> 13:55.399
and got wedged
under my brake pedal.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.490
I think this is
gonna be good for us.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.058
We can't let the past
define who we are.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.147
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah,
shake that booty ♪

14:04.191 --> 14:06.671
♪ Yeah, yeah.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.457
It's time to embrace
the future us.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.459
[chuckles]

14:11.502 --> 14:15.419
Oh... my... God.Oh... my... God.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.594
Why are you wearing that?Why are you wearing that?

14:16.638 --> 14:17.900
Oh, my God.Oh, my God.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.510
I got it online.I got it online.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.251
Now we both paid for shipping.Now we both paid for shipping.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.383
Stop doing that.Stop doing that.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.601
Stop doing that!Stop doing that!

14:23.645 --> 14:24.994
[both gasp]

14:25.038 --> 14:26.343
We're Clake.We're Clake.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.171
I'm going to change.I'm going to change.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.259
No, I'mgoing to change.No, I'mgoing to change.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.913
Okay, you go ahead.Okay, you go ahead.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.959
Ugh!Ugh!

14:41.489 --> 14:42.969
I know it's crazy,
but it feels

14:43.012 --> 14:45.145
like the moment we got rid
of all our old stuff,

14:45.188 --> 14:47.103
we merged
into the same person.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.888
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.238
Just give in to being Clake.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.328
But we don't want to be Clake.But we don't want to be Clake.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.938
Please.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.113
Thank you.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.811
But we don't want to be Clake.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.944
I'm really sorry, guys.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.294
If I'd've known the lyrics to
"Shake Your Booty, Yeah, Yeah"

15:04.338 --> 15:07.341
would've caused so much pain,
I never would've written them.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.781
Trust me, guys,
it is so much better this way.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.088
You always know what the other
person is talking about.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.699
For instance, if I say
something vague, like...

15:17.742 --> 15:19.701
"that actress
with the hair,"

15:19.744 --> 15:21.964
Daddy says...Naomi Watts.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.270
Mm-hmm.And if I say

15:23.313 --> 15:24.880
"the place with
the chairs..."

15:24.924 --> 15:26.708
Macaroni Grill.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.189
Okay.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.147
Well, you guys could just be
making this whole thing up.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.193
Oh, really?

15:39.590 --> 15:40.809
[clears throat]

15:40.852 --> 15:42.637
What's that thing
with the thing?

15:42.680 --> 15:45.466
Slightly damaged
golf umbrella.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.785
Can I help you?Yeah,

16:00.829 --> 16:02.874
I, um... I made my friends
give all their stuff away,

16:02.918 --> 16:04.964
and I feel like I ruined
their lives.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.053
Um, can I get it back?

16:07.096 --> 16:09.490
Yeah, that sounds like
a you problem, Crocodile Dun...

16:09.533 --> 16:12.014
Oh, my God.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.278
You're Cooper James.Hi.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.324
[laughing]:
Oh, my God.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.199
You're funny.
[chuckles]

16:23.243 --> 16:24.505
So, can I get it back?

16:24.548 --> 16:26.159
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
I mean, obviously, I want to,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.250
but I just have to ask
my manager first, so...

16:30.293 --> 16:33.731
Tina, get your ass out here
right now!

16:34.776 --> 16:36.517
TINA:
I'm on lunch.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.171
Oh, Tina, stop studying.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.868
You're never gonna graduate.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.609
Just get out here!

16:41.652 --> 16:43.089
[laughs]

16:43.132 --> 16:45.917
She's so stupid.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.485
Donna, what is your...

16:48.529 --> 16:51.532
My good friend, Cooper James,
left his stuff here

16:51.575 --> 16:52.968
and needs some help
getting it back.

16:53.012 --> 16:53.969
Is that cool?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.280
Oh...

17:01.324 --> 17:03.457
Oh, damn it, Tina!

17:03.500 --> 17:06.068
This is why celebrities
never come in here.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.379
I'm-I'm sorry.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.038
Good news, guys.
I have your stuff back.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.952
You remember my bodyguard.

17:20.996 --> 17:21.953
Ha-ha! Nightmare.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.303
[grunts]

17:23.346 --> 17:24.739
[laughs]

17:24.782 --> 17:27.437
Same old Nightmare.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.049
God, our treasures.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.528
[chuckles]

17:31.572 --> 17:33.748
The boomerang theory is real.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.054
Sorry we made fun
of you about it.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.533
You guys didn't make fun of me.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.362
Oh. [chuckles]
We did.Uh...

17:40.885 --> 17:42.104
Ah. Rebethany!

17:42.148 --> 17:45.934
Aw, how did someone
not immediately buy you?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.590
'Cause I don't think
Satan shops at Goodwill.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.074
My Grammy. Ha!

17:55.117 --> 17:58.555
Uh, uh, this is so
unexpected. Um...

17:58.599 --> 18:00.035
Oh, wow, I'm shaking.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.256
Uh, thank you, uh, the...
to the academy. Uh, I want

18:03.299 --> 18:04.866
to thank Cooper for
bringing this back.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.955
Uh... [stammers] They're
gonna play the music soon.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.827
Um, uh, support
music education!

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
[laughs]:
Stupid.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.181
You know, this is weird.
Now that I'm looking at this,

18:15.224 --> 18:18.880
I'm realizing I haven't been
to a concert in years.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.360
Really?

18:20.403 --> 18:22.492
Well, not since the "flashing
of the band" incident.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.018
Never taking my mom
to see Andrea Bocelli again.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.022
Isn't he blind?

18:31.066 --> 18:32.415
He is now.

18:33.982 --> 18:37.464
And I haven't played in
my rec league since, uh...

18:37.507 --> 18:39.901
[sniffs, gags]

18:39.944 --> 18:42.512
...2010.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.123
Why'd you stop doing
those things?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.733
Oh, I don't know.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.735
I guess I-I like spending
my nights with Jake.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.737
And he hates live music.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.304
But why'd you quit basketball?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.306
You know, well, all the games
were on Sunday mornings,

18:53.349 --> 18:55.395
and that's when Claire and I go
to the farmers' market

18:55.438 --> 18:57.658
and buy a bunch of produce
that we throw out on Thursdays.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.970
Jake, I don't want
to be the girl who stops you

19:06.014 --> 19:07.276
from playing basketball.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.973
Well, I don't want to be
the guy that stops you

19:09.017 --> 19:10.888
from going to concerts.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.153
We're not becoming Clake because
we scrubbed our old selves--

19:14.196 --> 19:17.199
it's because we've stopped being
our old selves.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.637
Wait, so Ididn't screw
you guys up?

19:20.681 --> 19:22.639
No way, man.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.989
Turns out, uh, we were
already screwed up.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.904
[chuckles]

19:26.948 --> 19:28.993
We just have to schedule
some time for you

19:29.037 --> 19:30.604
to go out there
and be Claire.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.259
Yeah. And for you
to be Jake. [chuckles]

19:33.302 --> 19:34.956
Thanks, babe.Thanks, babe.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.523
Hey!Hey!

19:36.566 --> 19:38.133
That... that was crazy.That was crazy.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.308
[both chuckle]

19:39.352 --> 19:40.309
Booga booga!Booga booga!

19:40.353 --> 19:41.528
Ah!
[laughs]

19:43.051 --> 19:45.836
So, uh, do you think
the ladies at Goodwill

19:45.880 --> 19:47.229
will let you bring
this stuff back?

19:47.273 --> 19:50.841
Yeah, I really don't think
I can go back there.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.196
Bye-bye, basket-bowls.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.417
Whoa! Whoa.Whoa!

20:01.461 --> 20:02.505
Those went up quick.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.419
Okay, well...

20:03.463 --> 20:04.681
[clicks tongue]

20:04.725 --> 20:06.683
Farewell, Rebethany.
[chuckles]

20:06.727 --> 20:10.426
You only had one eye,
but you saw me with two.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.300
I'm proud
of you guys.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.302
You're way too young and cool
to be living

20:16.345 --> 20:17.346
like Bonnie and Gerald.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.956
Which is why,
tomorrow night,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.481
I am going to a concert
with my girlfriends.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.569
Ah.Yeah, and I'm gonna

20:22.612 --> 20:24.092
play basketball
with my old crew.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.659
Although it's been
so long, I don't know

20:25.702 --> 20:27.313
if I can still
talk smack.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.184
Man, your hair
looks stupid!

20:29.228 --> 20:30.968
[chuckles]
Yep, still got it.[chuckles]

20:31.012 --> 20:32.448
[laughs]

20:32.492 --> 20:35.364
Hey, are you guys
seeing this?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.626
CLAIRE:
Oh, my God.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.932
She's not burning.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.151
[cackling]

20:40.195 --> 20:42.284
Aah!Aah!

20:42.328 --> 20:46.070
"Make me a grandchild,
and I'll spare your soul..."

20:46.114 --> 20:48.508
[chuckling]

20:49.509 --> 20:51.119
Uh, but seriously,
it's-it's weird

20:51.162 --> 20:52.555
that she's not burning, right?

20:52.599 --> 20:54.296
Yeah, we should
probably go inside.Yeah.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.040
Good riddance.
