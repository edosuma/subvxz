WEBVTT

01:02.600 --> 01:04.600
Thank you, everybody.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.840
Thank you.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.000
Hello!

01:09.040 --> 01:11.520
-Hello, peoples!
-Hello.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.360
Thank you very much.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.240
Thank you.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.160
Thank you so much.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.720
Thank you, everybody.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.480
And in this show...

01:22.680 --> 01:25.600
James stands in a park,

01:25.640 --> 01:29.000
I panic in a shop...

01:29.040 --> 01:31.560
...and Richard is touched
by a man.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.360
All that is coming later.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.080
It is not!

01:40.520 --> 01:43.720
Yes, it is. But first,
we start with this.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.960
This is the new Ford GT,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.200
and we have had thousands
of letters from people,

01:50.240 --> 01:52.840
all asking the same thing -

01:52.880 --> 01:55.000
"We know it's fast,
very fast,

01:55.040 --> 01:57.520
but is it faster
than an airliner?"

01:57.560 --> 01:59.440
Well,
not thousands of letters.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.000
Er...no, not thousands
of letters.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.320
-You mean, none.
-Yes.
We've had no letters at all.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.400
But I was interested in
finding out anyway,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.840
so this week, The Grand Tour
is off to New York.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.200
And here it is.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.400
Deep inside the concrete
canyons of Manhattan...

02:41.960 --> 02:45.320
...the fastest,
most beautiful,

02:45.360 --> 02:48.640
most expensive car
Ford has ever made.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.800
Some are saying that
it's just a 647-horsepower
racing car for the road,

02:56.840 --> 02:59.320
but actually,
it's a lot more than that.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.760
First things first -
it is very practical.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.320
It's got a boot which is
the exact same size

03:11.360 --> 03:14.160
as the glove box
on a Renault Clio,

03:14.200 --> 03:17.240
so you can get your luggage
in easily.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.080
And unlike the previous GT,

03:20.120 --> 03:22.960
it's got doors that
you can open in a car park

03:23.000 --> 03:24.680
cos they go up
rather than out.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.800
And you can get inside
even if you have a head.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.680
However,
the seat doesn't move.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.160
In order to get comfortable,
what you have to do is

03:36.200 --> 03:38.520
move the steering wheel
to where you want it

03:38.560 --> 03:41.920
and then you move the pedals.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.440
Pull this sort of
ratchet strap here, and...

03:46.600 --> 03:48.040
Right.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.600
Is that...
Is that fixed?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.720
The problem with this
moving-pedal arrangement is

04:01.760 --> 04:03.640
that when I push the brake,

04:03.680 --> 04:06.960
how do I know whether
I'm applying the brakes

04:07.000 --> 04:09.680
or just pushing the pedal
further away?

04:09.720 --> 04:11.960
How do I know
whether it's locked?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.480
I don't!

04:15.920 --> 04:18.600
After some nerve-racking
city-centre miles

04:18.640 --> 04:21.120
with a swallowy Adam
in my Big Apple...

04:23.640 --> 04:27.640
...I arrived in Central Park,
the start point of the race

04:27.680 --> 04:29.680
that no one's been
asking about.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.560
And dressed like
everyone else,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.920
my rival was waiting.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.640
There he is, Mr Slowly.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.280
-Morning.
Hang on.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.320
Right, what's the plan?

04:43.360 --> 04:45.120
Well, we're going to find out

04:45.160 --> 04:47.880
whether it's faster
to fly or drive

04:47.920 --> 04:50.200
from here
to the Canadian border.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.680
-Fly.
-Well, you say that,

04:52.720 --> 04:55.080
-but if you look on a map...

04:55.120 --> 04:58.160
...you, because you're not
using a car,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.080
will have to go from here
in Central Park

05:01.120 --> 05:04.000
on a train to JFK,
then fly to Buffalo

05:04.040 --> 05:07.520
and then use a bus
to get to the finish line

05:07.560 --> 05:09.960
at the Niagara Falls, where
I'll be waiting for you.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.920
You won't be waiting for me.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.400
I will. This thing does
216 miles an hour!

05:15.440 --> 05:17.880
Yes, I know, but where,
between there and there,

05:17.920 --> 05:20.200
are you gonna do
216 miles an hour?

05:20.240 --> 05:23.880
Yes, but you've got to spend
two hours at JFK being
touched inappropriately

05:23.920 --> 05:25.480
and giving them
your toothpaste.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.080
Anyway,
you've got a handicap.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.920
-Here it is!

05:34.560 --> 05:37.160
Seriously?
I thought he was in hospital.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
No, you mean you hoped he was
in hospital, but he isn't!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.200
He's come all the way
out here.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.400
He's keen
to get back to work.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.800
So I've become a carer,
is that what you're saying?

05:46.840 --> 05:48.400
Yes. Morning, Hammond.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.560
-We're very well.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.840
You do know this is
a race car, don't you?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.320
Yes, apart from the fact
it's got indicators
and a rear-view mirror and...

05:57.360 --> 05:59.120
Yeah, but it was built
to go racing,

05:59.160 --> 06:01.760
and you do know racing cars
never work on the road.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.280
After an hour in this,
you'll be scared
you're gonna to die.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.640
After two hours, you'll be
scared in case you don't die.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.440
Shall we just
get on with this?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.600
-Yes!

06:14.640 --> 06:16.720
What was that?

06:16.760 --> 06:19.240
-Nothing, nothing.
-That looks tremendous!

06:19.280 --> 06:23.120
I've got it up again now.
That was in its V-Max mode.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.560
Right. Ready, steady...

06:25.600 --> 06:27.080
Yes.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.840
Go.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.120
He hasn't got a chance,
has he?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.000
He has if you just
stand there. Let's go!

06:37.040 --> 06:38.880
It's this way, come on.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.320
There we are,
leaving the park.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.520
This is good.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.080
Come on, Hammond.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, good teamwork.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.280
Come on!

07:03.320 --> 07:06.160
Oh, it's good to be back!

07:06.200 --> 07:10.160
JAMES: As this was a race
between the car
and public transport,

07:10.200 --> 07:15.240
we'd be using two subway
trains, the AirTrain to JFK,

07:15.280 --> 07:19.720
a plane to Buffalo and then
two buses to the finish point

07:19.760 --> 07:22.280
at the Niagara Falls.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.440
Clarkson, meanwhile,
had a simple 420-mile thrash

07:26.480 --> 07:29.520
from one side of
New York State to the other.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.440
Yes! They're green on 89th.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.040
And they're green on 90th.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.680
We are screaming along now.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.040
There are some steps here.
Can you manage?

07:51.080 --> 07:53.320
Yes! Er...

07:58.800 --> 08:00.640
Hammond, there's more.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.280
"Start to begin. English.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.480
Fast MetroCard. Cash".

08:13.520 --> 08:15.000
Not everybody gives
a running commentary

08:15.040 --> 08:17.160
as they get a card,
most people just do it.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.880
Finally, I'd been caught
at a red light,

08:21.920 --> 08:25.960
but that was OK because I had
an important call to make.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.320
CUSTOMER-SERVICE REP:
Thank you for calling
JetBlue. How may I help you?

08:29.360 --> 08:32.080
Good morning,
my name's Jeremy Clarkson.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.920
You have a James May
and Richard Hammond

08:34.960 --> 08:38.120
booked on this morning's
flight from JFK to Buffalo.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.360
Sure. Do you have their
confirmation number, and can
you spell their last names?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.640
I don't have
a confirmation number.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.840
What I can tell you is that
they've been accidentally
booked by the office

08:47.880 --> 08:50.080
into business class.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.720
That's not company policy,
so could you drop them back
down to economy?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.440
Sure, let me take a look.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.360
OK, I will make this update
in their reservation

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
and we will email you
a confirmation.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.320
Is there anything else
we can help with?

09:02.360 --> 09:05.600
No, not for the moment,
thanks. Thank you very much.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.560
Oh, I'm on form this morning!

09:11.600 --> 09:13.680
As was
the world's worst carer.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.960
JAMES: Come on!

09:31.000 --> 09:34.760
With the world's clumsiest
driver stuck in a barrier...

09:36.480 --> 09:39.400
...I was getting used to
the monster

09:39.440 --> 09:41.960
that was powering me
through Manhattan.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.320
I used to own
the old Ford GT,

09:44.360 --> 09:46.920
and that was a brilliant car
in every way

09:46.960 --> 09:51.200
apart from the fact that
it was the size
of a football pitch,

09:51.240 --> 09:54.400
I knocked myself out
every time I closed the door,

09:54.440 --> 09:56.880
I couldn't see
what was coming at junctions,

09:56.920 --> 09:59.440
and it had
such a small fuel tank

09:59.480 --> 10:03.760
that it could only go about
six yards between fill-ups.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.040
This new version, however,
is completely different.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.720
It is longer than
the car I had, and wider

10:11.760 --> 10:14.880
and harder to see out of,
and incredibly,

10:14.920 --> 10:16.560
the fuel tank's even smaller.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.640
It only holds 12 gallons.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.240
And that means that
on this 420-mile race,

10:23.280 --> 10:26.400
I'm gonna have
to fill up...twice.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.840
Eek.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.520
It also has literally
the hardest ride
of any car I've ever driven.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.120
I know New York's roads are
atrocious, but this is stiff.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.040
This is... This is
stiffer than Ron Jeremy.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.600
Meanwhile...

10:49.760 --> 10:51.280
This is us.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.760
Other than throwing myself
down the stairs,

10:53.800 --> 10:55.640
this is all I've got.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.920
Right, we missed that one.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.080
JEREMY:
In the GT, I was already
leaving Manhattan.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.640
Right, we've got to go across
the Georgy Washington Bridge.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.720
Heading for New Jersey.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.640
Annoyingly though,
my storming progress

11:19.680 --> 11:22.080
was about to be halted
by roadworks.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.520
This traffic's worse than
I thought it was going to be.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.800
Come on!

11:39.000 --> 11:41.240
Er...James?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.240
Nothing, don't worry.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.600
-Nothing.

11:47.640 --> 11:52.680
Yeah, but it means both of
them, not just this one.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.800
Come and see the man
without a disability
sitting in the special seat!

11:59.520 --> 12:02.200
-Ow!
-There's nobody else disabled
down here.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.160
I'd be better if I could sit
in that special seat
that's reserved for me.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.960
It's reserved for
disabled people.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.640
-Like me!
-You're not disabled!

12:10.680 --> 12:12.400
Temporarily, yes, I am!

12:12.440 --> 12:14.880
You're not disabled, you've
had a playground injury

12:14.920 --> 12:16.840
as a result of your own
half-wittedness.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.160
-Oh!
-That's not disabled.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.560
I'm surprised you don't
do more charity work
with the differently abled.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.560
-Yes.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.040
Lot of love for the fast Ford
here.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.640
There always is, of course,
cos they're seen as sort of
blue-collar heroes.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.880
That said,
this one is $400,000.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.800
You can actually have
two Ferraris for the price
of one of these. Two!

12:47.400 --> 12:50.760
Meanwhile,
Hammond was heading for
the next subway train

12:50.800 --> 12:53.640
with the help
of Captain Compassionate.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.640
JAMES: Come on, come on,
come on! Come on!

12:59.280 --> 13:01.120
Come on!

13:04.440 --> 13:06.800
That's gone, then. Yeah.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.760
What happened there is,
basically,
we missed the train

13:09.800 --> 13:14.040
because you don't know
to slow down when it says
"finish" across the road.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.760
-Oh, nice!
-Sorry to put it
bluntly like that,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.120
but that's exactly
what happened.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.520
JEREMY:
I, meanwhile,
was off the bridge,

13:23.560 --> 13:28.840
and at last the GT had some
space to stretch its legs.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.320
Right, now, the roads are
opening up a bit,

13:31.360 --> 13:33.840
time to see
what this V6 can do.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.040
Right, here we go -
opening the taps!

13:46.000 --> 13:47.640
Bloody Nora!

13:51.320 --> 13:52.640
Aagh!

14:00.440 --> 14:02.000
What a machine!

14:04.080 --> 14:06.160
What an astonishing engine!

14:07.680 --> 14:10.640
It's a turbo-charged V6,
not a V8,

14:10.680 --> 14:14.080
which it should be
in a Ford GT,

14:14.120 --> 14:18.880
and it shares 60% of its
components with the engine
in a Ford pick-up truck.

14:18.920 --> 14:25.240
Yet somehow, it feels
like a mad Caterham

14:25.280 --> 14:27.160
when you put your foot down.

14:30.120 --> 14:34.640
I also love the way they
haven't messed around with
the sound this engine makes.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.920
There's no
electronic trickery,

14:40.960 --> 14:43.760
no artificial
barks and bangs,

14:43.800 --> 14:47.400
it's just a raucous,
deafening racket.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
JAMES: As Jeremy deafened
himself in New Jersey,

14:53.200 --> 14:55.160
we had finished
with the subways

14:55.200 --> 14:57.920
and were about to board
the train to the airport.

14:57.960 --> 15:03.320
-The train will be
in three minutes.
-Thank you.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.080
I'm gonna call May,
see how they're doing.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.800
PHONE COMPUTER:
Who would you like to call?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.880
Vagina.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.080
I've had to change his name
in my contacts.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.400
It's not normally Vagina,
it's worse than that.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.240
Hello, it's me. You rang.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.240
JEREMY:
You'll have to really speak
up, my car's quite noisy.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.920
I want to know,
what time do you get to JFK?

15:28.960 --> 15:33.680
We will get to JFK
in 25 minutes' time.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.400
This is embarrassing,
you're making a scene.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.640
I'm hoping to get the
11 minutes past one flight.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.520
May!

15:43.560 --> 15:46.160
You know what? He's done some
Bluetoothing, hasn't he?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.040
Oh, look.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.680
-Oh.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.360
What a bloody noise,
honestly!

15:58.400 --> 16:00.640
-Put some springs in them
or something.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.520
On the freeway,

16:04.560 --> 16:09.000
I was falling even more
under the spell of the GT.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.160
This car was
actually developed

16:11.200 --> 16:14.160
by a team of just 20 people,

16:14.200 --> 16:18.680
and they did it under the
radar of Ford's management.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.760
They had no idea
it was going on.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.760
Their only contribution to it
was insisting it had

16:24.800 --> 16:28.960
a little sort of glove-box
thing down here
in front of the seat

16:29.000 --> 16:32.440
so that when
they were testing it
on the streets of Detroit,

16:32.480 --> 16:34.880
they had somewhere
to store their Glocks.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.280
And it does actually feel
like it was put together
by a small team.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.840
It doesn't feel like
the product of
a mass-market manufacturer.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.760
There's nothing subtle
or damped or gentle
about anything it does.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.760
I just love it!

16:52.280 --> 16:54.360
JAMES: On the AirTrain,

16:54.400 --> 16:58.120
we too were finally
making swift progress.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.960
-That's excellent.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.920
JAMES: How fast would you say
this was going?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.120
It's probably 60mph.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.680
RICHARD: That's great!

17:06.720 --> 17:10.920
Observe - the train is
going faster than the cars.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.080
Not my car, it wasn't.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.840
As we are now
in the steady cruise,

17:20.880 --> 17:23.800
I've put it in "comfort",
and I can relax.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.600
The office has provided me
with an audiobook,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.440
which will help me
do just that. Here we go.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.080
JAMES :
I knew innately that

17:32.120 --> 17:34.720
loosening them meant
turning them anti-clockwise,

17:34.760 --> 17:36.880
a tiny hairspring
that contracted...

17:36.920 --> 17:39.200
JEREMY:
Sadly, it turned out to be

17:39.240 --> 17:42.040
a James May talking book
on how to mend things.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.840
JAMES :
What I didn't appreciate
at the age of five

17:44.880 --> 17:47.560
was the facility that the
freshly wound mainspring had

17:47.600 --> 17:49.840
for completing the
disassembly process for me,

17:49.880 --> 17:53.360
and as a quantum event
at that. It was there...

17:53.400 --> 17:56.320
JAMES: Having reached JFK
in no time at all...

17:58.520 --> 18:01.320
...Hop-Along Hammond was now
slowing us down again...

18:03.720 --> 18:06.480
...so I decided
to speed him up.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.680
You do realise this is not
a self-propelled one,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.320
it hasn't got
the big wheels,
you'll have to push me?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.760
-Yeah, that's all right.
-Cool.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.720
It's better than listening to
that clink-chink-clink noise
for the rest of the day.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.280
You've really suffered, mate.
I don't know how
you've put up with it.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.840
Thank you.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.200
-I'm just gonna do a quick
brake test.
-Yeah.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.520
Yeah, they work.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.680
JAMES :
Off came the back,

18:29.720 --> 18:31.720
suspiciously easily,
I would now realise.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.880
More screws lay within,
and on I went,

18:34.920 --> 18:36.880
like one of Carter's
archaeologists...

18:36.920 --> 18:40.560
How did he stay awake
to read that out?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.560
He's reassembling
an alarm clock,

18:42.600 --> 18:45.440
and he's made
an audio book of it.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.880
Oh, God!

18:49.040 --> 18:51.280
JAMES: With Hammond
now on four wheels,

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
we were doing well.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.800
This is so easy!

18:55.840 --> 18:58.720
SECURITY GUARD:
Take everything from
out of your pockets, please.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.240
However...

19:07.560 --> 19:09.520
Well,
I left them back in the...

19:09.560 --> 19:11.560
I can't get in there
without crutches.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.720
You were complaining.
I didn't think you wanted
them any more.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.960
-You gave them away!
-You're in a wheelchair.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.560
It's like a reserve
parachute, you don't go,
"I'm not using that".

19:18.600 --> 19:21.280
We haven't got the crutches.
Please may we go through?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.160
OK.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.280
RICHARD:
It may have been OK for him,

19:28.320 --> 19:30.360
but it definitely wasn't OK
for me.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.760
All right,
so I'm gonna go ahead,

19:37.800 --> 19:39.000
I'm going to give you
a pat

19:39.040 --> 19:40.960
-All right, sir.
-The pat-down consists of

19:41.000 --> 19:44.640
me starting from the top
all the way to the top
of your feet.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.760
For your sensitive areas,
I have to use
the back of my hands

19:47.800 --> 19:51.720
in a sliding motion,
from your waist,
going down over your groin

19:51.760 --> 19:54.000
and across your groin
as well,

19:54.040 --> 19:56.680
then sliding my way
down your leg, OK?

20:03.800 --> 20:07.720
Sitrep - 300 miles to go,

20:07.760 --> 20:11.360
and I've been doing
16.4 miles to the gallon,

20:11.400 --> 20:13.520
and I'm on the motorway.

20:13.560 --> 20:17.040
That's not bad.
I mean, it's not a prize,
but it's not bad.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.880
They should be at JFK now
having their penises touched

20:20.920 --> 20:23.560
and deodorant confiscated.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.520
I'm gonna go up and down, OK?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.200
I'm going down.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.360
I'll go up and down one more
time at the top of the leg.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.800
JEREMY: At this point,

20:43.840 --> 20:46.680
I decided to make life even
worse for Hammond and May

20:46.720 --> 20:49.520
by making another call
to their airline.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.600
CUSTOMER-SERVICE REP:
Thank you for calling
JetBlue. How may I help you?

20:52.640 --> 20:55.960
Really sorry
to trouble you again.
It's Jeremy Clarkson here.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.720
I spoke earlier about

20:57.760 --> 21:01.480
downgrading Mr May and
Mr Hammond to economy class.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.680
-Yeah.
-If I could tell you,

21:03.720 --> 21:08.280
in confidence - they've both
just come out of rehab.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.840
So on the flight,
could you make sure

21:10.880 --> 21:13.400
the attendants don't
give them any alcohol?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.720
Thank you
for letting us know.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.360
I will go onto the
reservation and make a note

21:18.400 --> 21:21.320
and give it
to our in-flight crew.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.680
We will make sure
to accommodate
this special request.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.800
Thank you
for your understanding.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.680
OK, goodbye.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.680
PHONE COMPUTER:
Calling Vagina.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.280
-Hold on.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.240
We're at JFK.
How far have you got?

21:38.280 --> 21:40.560
I've done 153 miles.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.160
-Yeah.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.480
Right, well,
this is where we catch up.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.840
We're about to board
the 500mph shuttle.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.400
How long's your flight?

21:49.440 --> 21:51.080
One hour and 15 minutes.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.800
Righty-ho.
I could literally...

21:53.840 --> 21:56.720
I might stop
and have lunch in a minute.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you at the end

21:58.560 --> 22:00.600
and keep a beer warm for you.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.960
You definitely will need
a drink if you get
to the end, I assure you.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.880
Got to go now -
important work.

22:06.920 --> 22:10.000
-Goodbye.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.400
Economy and no drinks!

22:12.440 --> 22:14.800
I am so
gonna win this today.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.560
JEREMY: Calls over,
I put my foot down

22:19.600 --> 22:21.960
and went back
into the noise zone.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.240
Honestly...

22:41.280 --> 22:44.480
...you would not believe,

22:44.520 --> 22:48.320
you simply wouldn't believe
the noise that
that car makes.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.160
It's just...
It's just so relentless.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.400
I can't imagine
having to put up with that
endless bellowing drone.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.200
Yeah, it's a dreary drone.

22:57.240 --> 23:02.320
Just going on and on
and on and on.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.560
You think you had it bad,
I was travelling
with a handicap!

23:07.720 --> 23:12.080
James, it's not 1950.
The correct term these days
is "a disabled".

23:12.120 --> 23:15.440
He's not disabled,
he's just clumsy.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.960
What?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
Actually,
on that whole point,

23:18.640 --> 23:20.200
able-bodied people
like to think that

23:20.240 --> 23:22.280
everything that could be done
to make life easier

23:22.320 --> 23:25.640
and convenient for disabled
people has been done,

23:25.680 --> 23:27.560
but when you find yourself
in that position,

23:27.600 --> 23:31.520
you realise it really,
really hasn't.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.920
The Grand Tour -
a show that cares.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.840
This week
it's disabled people

23:38.880 --> 23:42.440
and next week we're doing
people who are BLT.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.040
Erm...that's a sandwich.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.320
What is it I mean?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.960
You mean, LGBT.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.520
Yes, that.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.040
That's what I meant, not BLT.
Er...anyway...

23:53.080 --> 23:55.960
It's lesbian, gay, bacon
and tomato - that's the one.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.400
That's my favourite sandwich,
and we're doing that
next week.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.840
Later on, though,
we'll be picking the race up,

24:01.880 --> 24:03.400
so don't go away.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.920
Absolutely, there'll be
more of that later.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.800
But now it is time for us
to lean

24:07.840 --> 24:10.640
on the lamppost of chat,
in Conversation Street.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.800
Right, yes, now -
Formula One season is over,

24:23.840 --> 24:25.800
and as we all know, I'm sure,

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
Lewis Hamilton is
world champion,

24:27.880 --> 24:30.040
and well done, him.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.000
I think we all agree on that.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.000
I'm sure the Baby Jesus
was very pleased.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.520
-I don't doubt it.
-They're like that.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.040
They're close.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.840
For me though, the highlight
of the entire season

24:39.880 --> 24:42.160
was on the podium in Mexico,

24:42.200 --> 24:46.160
where Kimi Raikkonen set what
I think is a new world record

24:46.200 --> 24:49.000
for the longest
chug of champagne.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.760
-Honestly.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.720
Everyone else is
spraying it round.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.240
Back of shot...

24:56.280 --> 24:59.200
I thought, "I know
the Finns like a drink,

24:59.240 --> 25:01.200
but he must have
a titanium throat!"

25:01.240 --> 25:04.080
Imagine the burp he did
afterwards, a whole bottle.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.600
It's staggering.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.760
I think the problem is
for most people,

25:07.800 --> 25:10.120
champagne on the podium
is a ritual,

25:10.160 --> 25:12.560
but for Kimi Raikkonen,
it's just another drink,

25:12.600 --> 25:14.640
and he hasn't had one
for at least two hours.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.440
I often wonder - you know
in Abu Dhabi, on the podium,

25:17.480 --> 25:19.560
they're given rose water,
not champagne?

25:19.600 --> 25:22.120
If Kimi's coming 3rd,
he's thinking,

25:22.160 --> 25:26.080
"I've got to go on the podium
for 20 minutes
and drink rose water."

25:26.120 --> 25:28.400
"Oh, no, I'm 4th.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.320
Straight to my motorhome
and have a beer".

25:30.360 --> 25:32.400
-Tuck in!
-I mean, he is a Finn!

25:32.440 --> 25:34.200
That's what they do.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.960
Anyway, self-driving cars.
We're told they're coming.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.120
-Yes.
-We were told this week,

25:40.160 --> 25:41.920
actually,
that there's a problem.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.360
In cities like New York,
and I guess other cities
around the world,

25:45.400 --> 25:47.280
people who drive them,
indeed the cars themselves,

25:47.320 --> 25:48.800
are going to be bullied.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.960
-That's what they're saying.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.520
Obviously, these cars will be
programmed to never run over
a person, OK?

25:55.560 --> 25:58.400
Which means you can just go
and stand in front of them.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.160
I mean, you could.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.720
You could do better than
that, you could probably
herd them a bit.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.720
I could herd them
and I would herd them.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.120
Can you imagine
how sanctimonious

26:08.160 --> 26:11.920
the man sitting in his new
self-driving car is gonna be
with his paper?

26:11.960 --> 26:14.720
"I'm not driving,
I'm just reading the paper
while it drives me home."

26:14.760 --> 26:16.440
If you just go, "Back up!"

26:16.480 --> 26:18.760
It'll be going,
"I mustn't run him over!"

26:18.800 --> 26:22.480
Back him into a river.
That's what I'd do, I would.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.640
They'll have all those
algorithms on board

26:24.680 --> 26:27.160
for moral decisions as to
what they're gonna do.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.720
-So carry a fake baby.
-Good plan!

26:29.760 --> 26:31.720
Walk up to it,
the car will think,

26:31.760 --> 26:34.240
"Fake baby or fat, smug man
in a business suit?"

26:34.280 --> 26:37.200
- He's going in the river.
- This is exactly right.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.000
That would be tremendous.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.040
Sadly, I don't think we're
going to see anything like

26:41.080 --> 26:43.200
an autonomous car
until long after we're dead.

26:43.240 --> 26:44.880
No, I couldn't
agree with you more.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.360
They are years and years and
years away, decades away.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.600
It's such a complicated area
to apply what is
essentially robotics.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.400
You're dead right
about robotics.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.840
I don't yet have a robot that
could make me a cup of tea,

26:56.880 --> 26:59.160
which is quite simple,
or bring me my slippers.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.480
-Just domestic stuff.
-Sex robots aren't here yet.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.120
That's people from Essex,
isn't it?

27:04.880 --> 27:06.880
There's a TV show about that,
isn't there?

27:06.920 --> 27:08.800
-Orange Sex...

27:08.840 --> 27:11.040
You're from Essex? There's
a sex robot here, look.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.760
RICHARD: Hiya!

27:12.800 --> 27:15.160
That's what he thinks of you.
I don't, personally.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.640
That's amazing.
It's incredibly convincing!

27:18.680 --> 27:20.760
Can you go like that...

27:20.800 --> 27:24.200
Can we stop this
conversation? It's gonna
go somewhere wrong.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.520
The way I'd sum this up
is this.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.320
Somebody says,
"We've made this
self-driving car, brilliant."

27:29.360 --> 27:33.040
I will take him to Bolivia,
put him at the bottom
of Death Road

27:33.080 --> 27:35.640
and say, "Sit in it,
reading your paper

27:35.680 --> 27:38.920
while it drives you up there,
passing all the buses
with the 1,000-foot drop.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.640
If you're prepared to do that
and you can reach the top

27:41.680 --> 27:45.200
with no poo in your
underpants, I'll buy one."

27:45.240 --> 27:47.800
"Enjoy reading your newspaper
on the way".
It's not gonna work.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.240
No, right - "Agh!"

27:50.280 --> 27:52.280
That's covered
self-driving cars.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.520
We needn't worry.
Shall we move it on?

27:54.560 --> 27:57.040
Yes. Moving on.
Interesting news this week -

27:57.080 --> 28:00.520
Jeremy has been approached
to be the ambassador...

28:00.560 --> 28:02.200
-Oh, yeah!
-...for a vineyard

28:02.240 --> 28:04.600
-in the South of France.
-Yes, I have.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.960
What are they thinking?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.120
Imagine a better job
than that.

28:08.160 --> 28:13.600
-Oh, yeah.
"I am the Ambassador
for Chateau ."

28:13.640 --> 28:15.960
How's that going to go?
"Where is the Ambassador?"

28:16.000 --> 28:18.760
"He's out the back,
completely clattered,

28:18.800 --> 28:20.360
where he always is."

28:20.400 --> 28:22.360
You're not an ambassador,
you're a customer!

28:22.400 --> 28:24.480
Sorry - he's out the back
with pneumonia.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.320
-Ambassadorial pneumonia.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.120
I don't know how
it's going to work though,
cos the problem is,

28:31.160 --> 28:33.280
the three of us have never
had a commercial tie-in.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.160
You may be surprised
to hear this -
we dress ourselves.

28:38.120 --> 28:41.240
No, he doesn't mean we
put our clothes on ourselves.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.760
We're not sponsored by
a clothing company.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.520
I know you'll be staggered
to hear that.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.240
-Model's own.
-Yes, this is it.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.280
I go into a shop and I
choose these and I buy them

28:50.320 --> 28:52.120
with my money,
watches and everything.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.000
We buy everything ourselves.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.640
That's why we don't know
how it works,
the commercial stuff.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.600
Actually, it's funny
you should mention that,

28:58.640 --> 29:00.280
because you know that
pink-and-purple-striped

29:00.320 --> 29:02.360
rugby-shirt thing
I've had for years?

29:02.400 --> 29:04.440
-Yeah.
- You know the one I mean.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.640
-It's a top.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.160
-It's a top.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.480
-It's a top.
-It's not a top!

29:11.520 --> 29:13.840
It's not a shirt,
it's not a T-shirt.

29:13.880 --> 29:17.360
Hammond, I've never said this
before and I promise
I'll never say it again,

29:17.400 --> 29:19.240
but I'm with James May
on this.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.840
-A man cannot wear a "top".
-Ordinarily, no,

29:21.880 --> 29:25.160
but that is... Technically,
it's a hooped top.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.440
Anyway, that's not the point.
I was at an event once,

29:28.480 --> 29:31.160
and a man sidled up to me,
took me to one side.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.080
He was from Gant, the big
American clothing company

29:33.120 --> 29:35.880
-that made that thing
originally, the shirt!
-Top.

29:35.920 --> 29:40.120
He begged me, he said,
"Please stop wearing it."

29:40.160 --> 29:41.720
And then...

29:41.760 --> 29:44.080
It got better than that.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.840
He says,
"If you stop wearing it,

29:45.880 --> 29:48.320
you can have as many
free clothes as you like."

29:48.360 --> 29:50.960
But I still said no
because I'm an arse.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.440
Hey! What about...
Why don't we do...

29:56.480 --> 29:58.520
-Reverse sponsorship.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.560
It's just occurring to me.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.920
You know Levi's once said
I'm ruining
the Levi reputation?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.760
-They did!
-Because I always
wear Levi's.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.960
Why don't I say to them,
"Give me 100 grand,

30:09.000 --> 30:10.600
I'll wear Rounders"?

30:10.640 --> 30:13.840
-Erm...

30:13.880 --> 30:15.880
I'm going to sit like this,

30:15.920 --> 30:17.800
and I'm going to say
something deeply offensive

30:17.840 --> 30:20.200
to millions of people
around the world, Omega!

30:22.160 --> 30:25.360
Unless you send me 50 grand,
and I'll wear a Rolex,

30:25.400 --> 30:29.320
which is the watch of choice
for all the world's arses.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.320
I'm not a lawyer...

30:33.840 --> 30:36.280
It is extortion.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.880
It just is.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.520
I've got a better idea.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.200
Why don't we say to people,
they can put in bids

30:42.240 --> 30:44.480
to put their logo on
the bottom
of Richard Hammond's car?

30:44.520 --> 30:46.840
Because the chances are...

30:48.560 --> 30:50.040
Yes!

30:50.080 --> 30:52.400
Thank you!

30:52.440 --> 30:56.360
-Thank you.
-Imagine the commentary.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.480
"Here comes Richard Hammond.
Oh, no, he's gone off!
Pepsi".

31:01.440 --> 31:03.360
-That's a very good idea.
-Moving on.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.920
That's the end
of Conversation Street.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.720
We must move it on
with this.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.040
Imagine what it's like
to be a car designer.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.120
You love cars,
you always have.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.320
Your school exercise books
were full of
drawings of cars.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.960
You worked hard,
you got to college,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.520
learned about geometry
and proportions

31:18.560 --> 31:20.600
and classicism and airflow
and legislation.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.480
Then one day
you get your qualification,

31:23.520 --> 31:28.160
and you land your dream job
somewhere like Mercedes-Benz.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.440
And you spend
your first four years

31:31.480 --> 31:36.040
designing the new seat-belt
release button
for the A-Class hatchback.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.640
Exactly, or a tailgate handle
for a van. Ooh!

31:39.680 --> 31:42.720
It's not exactly what
they dreamed of as kids,

31:42.760 --> 31:44.320
is it, car designers?

31:44.360 --> 31:46.360
Which is why they
occasionally get bolshie

31:46.400 --> 31:48.080
and they say
to the management,

31:48.120 --> 31:51.640
"Look, would you please let
us do something interesting?"

31:51.680 --> 31:56.360
And that is obviously
what's happened
with the new Mercedes GT R.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.480
You just know the designers
have said, "Can it be green

32:18.520 --> 32:21.520
and can it have a mouth that
could be used
for sifting krill

32:21.560 --> 32:23.640
and can the bonnet
be nine miles long

32:23.680 --> 32:27.520
and can it have bits
of the Battlestar Galactica
on its gills?"

32:29.440 --> 32:33.520
The bosses obviously thought,
"They're being idiotic."

32:33.560 --> 32:37.400
But to keep them sweet,
they let them get on with it.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.800
The upshot is a car
that only really appeals

32:42.840 --> 32:45.760
to those that have
a mental age of eight,

32:45.800 --> 32:49.320
and that's me
and every other man.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.680
It even makes
a childish noise.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.720
Just brilliant!

33:07.760 --> 33:09.640
Unfortunately however,

33:09.680 --> 33:13.120
because the stylists
were allowed
to do what they wanted,

33:13.160 --> 33:16.400
the engineers then
stuck out their bottom lips

33:16.440 --> 33:18.960
and said they wanted
a free hand too.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.040
The trouble is that
unlike car stylists,

33:26.080 --> 33:29.040
who are flamboyant
and usually drunk,

33:29.080 --> 33:32.280
car engineers
tend to be very sensible.

33:32.320 --> 33:36.560
You can tell this just by
looking at their trousers.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.600
So they fitted this with
all sorts of sensible stuff.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.280
It's got a flap, for example,
which lowers itself

33:43.320 --> 33:45.880
from the bottom of the car
when you're going quickly

33:45.920 --> 33:47.960
to reduce the air pressure
down there.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.040
That literally sucks the car
into the Tarmac,

33:52.080 --> 33:54.080
giving you more grip.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.440
Then there's
the traction control,

33:56.480 --> 33:59.080
which you can turn off
using this button here.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.000
Then you can decide how off
you'd like it to be

34:03.040 --> 34:06.640
using this piece of Lego
here.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.160
You turn it that way, and
it's really very off indeed.

34:10.200 --> 34:15.000
Then you swivel it round, and
now it's only slightly off.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.360
I never knew "off"
was a variable thing,

34:18.400 --> 34:19.720
but there you go.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.840
Other things - well, the body
is made from carbon fibre

34:26.880 --> 34:31.400
and titanium and magnesium
to make it light.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.720
And it's got two
Venturi tunnels at the back

34:34.760 --> 34:37.600
and short gearing
and four-wheel steering.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.880
There's so much techy stuff
on the GT R, in fact,

34:46.920 --> 34:49.280
that it is really...

34:49.320 --> 34:51.200
...very fast

34:51.240 --> 34:54.760
and extremely well
sorted out.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.480
The turning, thanks to
the four-wheel steering,

35:15.520 --> 35:18.040
is incredible,
and when you go through

35:18.080 --> 35:22.240
Dentalcare Swindon,
run by dentists for patients,

35:22.280 --> 35:26.640
it's like a small
and very eager dog.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.520
Then you've got the gearbox,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.520
which I think was designed by
Mystic Meg

35:31.560 --> 35:34.760
because it always
seems to know

35:34.800 --> 35:37.080
what's going to happen next.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.240
It is uncanny!

35:41.280 --> 35:45.000
But the best thing is
the braking. You ready?

35:45.040 --> 35:47.000
Watch this.

35:51.640 --> 35:55.600
Has my face actually
come off

35:55.640 --> 35:59.320
Small wonder, then, that
the GT R holds the lap record

35:59.360 --> 36:02.440
for rear-wheel drive cars
at the Nurburgring,

36:02.480 --> 36:06.400
and that is its problem.

36:06.440 --> 36:10.720
Because AMG Mercs aren't
really supposed to set
lap records.

36:10.760 --> 36:14.160
They're not supposed to be
particularly fast.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.360
You buy an AMG Merc
cos you want it to do this...

36:21.400 --> 36:23.400
...make a lot of noise

36:23.440 --> 36:27.880
while sliding through a
cloud of its own tyre smoke.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.640
In an AMG Merc,

36:29.680 --> 36:33.040
you don't want to go round
a corner crisply at 150,

36:33.080 --> 36:38.760
you want to go round smiling
and sideways at about 27.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.880
And there's another thing
too...

36:44.520 --> 36:45.960
...the engine.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.840
It's a twin turbo-charged V8,

36:49.880 --> 36:54.760
which produces 577
horsepower, and that's a lot.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.800
But exactly the same engine
in an E-Class saloon

36:57.840 --> 37:00.320
produces
more than 600 horsepower.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.200
So why not use that engine
in here?

37:09.240 --> 37:12.080
The only possible reason
is that soon,

37:12.120 --> 37:14.360
there'll be a more powerful,

37:14.400 --> 37:16.400
even faster version
of this car,

37:16.440 --> 37:18.880
so why buy this one now?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.160
It's a good question.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.080
I wouldn't.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.080
So, who would buy a car
like that?

37:42.120 --> 37:44.040
I don't know,
I've never met anyone

37:44.080 --> 37:47.040
who I think would like that
car, would want to buy it.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.840
Besides all that,
if you want something

37:48.880 --> 37:51.560
that feels like a Porsche,
why not buy, say, a Porsche?

37:51.600 --> 37:54.080
Because Porsche are really
good at making Porsches.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.400
RICHARD: They are.
-Yeah.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.800
They're so good
at making Porsches

37:56.840 --> 37:59.360
that since you filmed that,
their new GT2

37:59.400 --> 38:00.920
has gone round
the Nurburgring

38:00.960 --> 38:02.080
faster than the GTR.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.840
The worst thing is,

38:03.880 --> 38:05.920
that's the first time I've
ever filmed an AMG Merc

38:05.960 --> 38:07.200
and finished the day

38:07.240 --> 38:09.880
on the same set of tyres
I started with.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.560
And I don't like that.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.920
I want an AMG Merc to eat
its own feet in every corner.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.600
That's what it's for, yes.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.400
Anyway, if you are
the sort of person

38:18.440 --> 38:21.520
who wants to buy
a shouty, lime green car

38:21.560 --> 38:23.240
that looks mad
but actually isn't,

38:23.280 --> 38:24.520
then you'll probably
want to know

38:24.560 --> 38:27.040
how fast it goes around
our Eboladrome.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.800
Yeah. Last year,
that would have meant

38:28.840 --> 38:30.640
handing it over
to the American.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.640
But we're not using him
any more,

38:32.680 --> 38:35.680
because he didn't like
coming to England.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.720
And because
you all hated him.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.320
-Well, that too.
-Little bit.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.440
But the point is,
we needed a replacement,

38:43.480 --> 38:45.000
we needed a new driver.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.800
And we've spent
the last nine months

38:46.840 --> 38:48.840
auditioning everyone
we could think of.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.280
Former F1 drivers,

38:50.320 --> 38:52.320
rally drivers, stunt drivers,
test drivers,

38:52.360 --> 38:55.320
until we ended up
with the fastest.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.840
And here she is.

38:56.880 --> 39:00.640
Right, here we go.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.760
JEREMY: And she's off.
Tidy start, no wheelspin,

39:03.800 --> 39:05.520
full power
from the twin-turbo V8.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.880
To the first corner.
Will she lift?

39:07.920 --> 39:10.000
No, it didn't sound like
she did.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.680
Right, second corner,
balancing the car nicely.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.760
God, that thing
looks planted.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.640
Right, here we go,
this is the tricky bit.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.840
Let's have a look how she's
getting on round here.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.960
Ooh, that thing
looks planted!

39:23.000 --> 39:24.600
And quick.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.560
She's on the raggedy edge
on the down-changes.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.240
Michelins squealing in pain,
but that is...

39:30.280 --> 39:33.240
Let's have a look.
Yeah, inch-perfect.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.040
Now, back onto the Isn't.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.960
She really has only one
throttle position here,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.280
and it is in the carpet.

39:40.320 --> 39:44.560
Lifting now, and into the
Old Lady's House complex.

39:44.600 --> 39:48.000
Working the low-speed grip
through there.

39:48.040 --> 39:53.280
Yeah, and back on the gas for
the bumpy run to Substation.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.920
Showing no mercy down there.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.160
Leaving the braking
nice and late.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.320
Tidy line through
the second-to-last corner.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.960
Just Field of Sheep to go.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.720
Really on it through there,
and across the line.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.240
That was an impressive lap,

40:09.280 --> 40:11.640
but let's see
how fast it was.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.160
Here we go.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.800
Past the... Oh, it's quicker.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.040
-Yes!

40:17.080 --> 40:18.880
Bloody hell!

40:20.400 --> 40:24.400
1:18.7. That is quick.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.840
Yeah, it is, and she is
an incredible driver.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.120
She's a phenomenal driver,
absolutely phenomenal.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.880
We are delighted
to have her on board.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.040
But now it is time to move on
to Celebrity Face-Off.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
Yes. And once again
it is an international event

40:53.040 --> 40:55.800
as baseball takes on cricket.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.960
In short,
we're trying to find out

40:58.000 --> 40:59.800
who is the fastest person
in the world

40:59.840 --> 41:03.400
who earns a living
from throwing and catching
small balls.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.320
So would you please welcome

41:06.360 --> 41:08.600
Kevin Pietersen
and Brian Wilson.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.480
JEREMY: Gentlemen!

41:12.520 --> 41:13.560
Hello, sir.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.720
-Good.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.400
Good. Have a seat.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.160
Brian. Good to see you.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.400
That is a look!

41:25.200 --> 41:27.000
That is a look
you've got going there.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.000
First of all, thank you
very much for coming.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.400
Thanks for having us.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.120
And let's begin
with a simple one, OK?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.600
Actually, it's not
that simple.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.200
Kevin, could you explain
to our American viewers

41:36.240 --> 41:38.840
what cricket is?

41:38.880 --> 41:41.000
I think I'm very lucky,
we've got...

41:41.040 --> 41:42.240
I'm bored already actually!

41:43.960 --> 41:47.440
-No, go on, have another
bash.
-No.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.920
Just cos I don't like it
and it gives me hay fever.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.440
Go on.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.840
Yeah, it's very difficult.
For American...

41:53.880 --> 41:55.960
I play a lot of golf with
a lot of American people

41:56.000 --> 41:57.760
and they literally,
after two minutes,

41:57.800 --> 41:59.680
tell me to go away,
swearing at me,

41:59.720 --> 42:02.680
because how can you play
a game for five days
and not get a result?

42:02.720 --> 42:04.360
But there's T20s
that Brian knows about,

42:04.400 --> 42:06.880
he's been to India,
he's played T20s in India,

42:06.920 --> 42:08.440
and it's a pretty cool game.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.000
-I reckon you could do a T20.
-No, I couldn't.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.600
With cricket, you stand there
in the outfield,

42:14.640 --> 42:18.120
the ball,
super-heated from re-entry,

42:18.160 --> 42:20.040
is coming, "Ah, ah, ah,"

42:20.080 --> 42:22.640
and then it always lands
right on the end of your...

42:22.680 --> 42:24.680
-"Gah!"

42:24.720 --> 42:26.880
-Yeah, and everyone shouts.
-That's convenient.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.600
Everybody shouts,
and you drop the ball,

42:29.640 --> 42:31.800
and you're batting
and some enormous man...

42:31.840 --> 42:34.320
It's miserable, it goes on,
as you say, five days.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.240
Actually, before we move on,

42:36.280 --> 42:38.640
perhaps you could explain
to the British viewers

42:38.680 --> 42:40.360
what baseball is.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.600
It's not much more exciting.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.400
JEREMY: I've seen...
-It's a little faster.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.880
I've seen clips of it
in films,

42:48.920 --> 42:50.880
like Good Will Hunting,
there's a scene of it.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.200
It's rounders.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.480
-Now, I just learned...

42:56.520 --> 42:58.400
I just learned
what rounders was today,

42:58.440 --> 43:01.160
and in all fairness,
no, no, it's not like that.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.400
Men play this sport as well.

43:03.440 --> 43:07.080
Can you be drunk
while playing baseball?

43:07.120 --> 43:09.600
-You can be, I guess, yeah.
-Cos you are...

43:09.640 --> 43:11.200
Everyone is in cricket,
I presume.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.680
We're all piss-heads.
Cricketers are piss-heads.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.280
The great
celebrated cricketers,

43:15.320 --> 43:17.720
the Flintoffs, the Warnes,
piss-heads.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.440
BRIAN: Piss
-Piss-heads, yeah.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.520
JEREMY: It's OK.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.760
Or as we call them,
ambassadors.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.640
With pneumonia.
That's what it is.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.960
I was astonished
to read the other day

43:35.000 --> 43:37.640
about the England
cricket team and how...

43:37.680 --> 43:39.640
Actually, the Australian
cricket team as well,

43:39.680 --> 43:41.400
I presume it's the same
in South Africa,

43:41.440 --> 43:44.400
is how much drinking went on
at the "tea break".

43:44.440 --> 43:45.960
Yeah. There's a world record

43:46.000 --> 43:48.480
for the amount of alcohol
consumed on an aeroplane

43:48.520 --> 43:51.280
by a cricketer from Australia
for the Ashes,

43:51.320 --> 43:54.440
and there was an Australian
cricketer drank 52 beers

43:54.480 --> 43:56.320
on his way over
from Australia.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.960
That's aggressive.
That's aggressive.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.440
That's a big amount.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.480
-That's a big amount.
-That's a lot of drunk.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.520
Now, we must move
on to cars, if we may,

44:04.560 --> 44:06.520
-having covered the sport.
-Sure.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.160
Maybe begin with you, Brian,
OK?

44:09.200 --> 44:10.960
You had,
I think it's fair to say,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.680
an inauspicious start
to your driving career.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.560
It wasn't the best start, no.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.840
So, 16, got my licence.

44:18.880 --> 44:22.440
First day, I got a speeding
ticket, that was expected.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.600
Second day, though,
it's about 1am,

44:24.640 --> 44:26.840
apparently we have a curfew
I didn't know about,

44:26.880 --> 44:28.920
you have to be in bed
by a certain time.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.040
As a 16-year-old,
I'm thinking, "No, I don't."

44:31.080 --> 44:33.680
So I rolled through
the stop sign,

44:33.720 --> 44:35.760
and I see the blue lights,
and I'm thinking,

44:35.800 --> 44:39.000
"I'm in a '94 Thunderbird,
this is a V8 engine."

44:39.040 --> 44:40.800
So I speed.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.440
Now I'm getting
in a police chase.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.480
-Now the adrenaline's going.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.840
BRIAN: The second day.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.560
I'm driving around
my neighbourhood,

44:47.600 --> 44:49.480
and I accidentally hit
an electrical box

44:49.520 --> 44:51.880
and the power goes out
and I feel really bad.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.960
But I left this guy
in the dust.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
Like, I got all the way
to my driveway.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.720
But because
I turned the keys off...

45:00.760 --> 45:03.360
The car was automatic lights.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.720
So the cop
just followed the lights

45:06.760 --> 45:09.360
and arrested me in my
driveway, my front yard.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.560
And so what do you get
for that, for...

45:11.600 --> 45:14.760
What do you get?
You get to go to jail,
you get a free ride.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.120
And I'm amazed
they pull you over,

45:18.160 --> 45:21.160
cos you look like
an accountant, I mean...

45:21.200 --> 45:24.120
This is a slow Tuesday.
See me on the weekends!

45:24.160 --> 45:27.440
So, Kevin, your first car
was a Nissan...

45:27.480 --> 45:29.440
-Pulsar.
-Which is a bit boring.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.880
It's not as good as his
V8 Thunderbird, is it?

45:31.920 --> 45:33.880
It is boring, apart from
a couple of gadgets.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.120
I got a couple of gadgets

45:35.160 --> 45:38.160
that were put in
by my late grandfather.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.600
And in South Africa, the
crime rate's pretty severe,

45:40.640 --> 45:43.760
so there was a switch he had
put underneath the ignition

45:43.800 --> 45:45.840
you had to flip before
you could turn the car.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.080
If you didn't flip it
within 20 seconds, the car...

45:48.120 --> 45:50.760
Would explode, killing
everybody within 40 yards.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.320
-That's safe!
-The South African way.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.920
There was another one,

45:54.960 --> 45:56.800
every time you put it into
reverse, "Doo, doo, doo."

45:56.840 --> 45:58.960
I'm a cool 18-year-old
driving around Durban,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.760
I put it in reverse, everyone
goes, "Where's the
truck?"

46:03.160 --> 46:05.160
It was a little red
Nissan Pulsar,

46:05.200 --> 46:06.920
"Doo, doo, doo, doo,"
out of it.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.400
So really, you're basically
a slightly more wild driver.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.960
Did you not buy a police car
at one stage?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.960
I did have a police car.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.760
And I did get
pulled over in that. So...

46:17.800 --> 46:20.120
Again, why would you
get pulled over?

46:20.160 --> 46:21.800
It wasn't my fault, though.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.440
They said I was trying to
impersonate a police officer,

46:24.480 --> 46:26.800
which I wasn't, it was just
a cool car to drive in.

46:26.840 --> 46:30.560
I may have pulled a friend
over as a joke.

46:32.920 --> 46:33.880
Yeah, you have sirens.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.080
Have you ever gone anywhere
in a car

46:37.120 --> 46:39.880
and not been pulled over
by the police?

46:39.920 --> 46:42.080
Just thinking, going back
to the sporting thing,

46:42.120 --> 46:44.400
when you played cricket
briefly in India,

46:44.440 --> 46:46.600
you managed to get
into trouble with that one.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.480
-Yeah, and felt really bad.

46:48.520 --> 46:51.800
So, well, where I was,
it was just a large field

46:51.840 --> 46:53.800
and there might have been
100 games going on,

46:53.840 --> 46:56.360
all the kids
from around local playing,

46:56.400 --> 46:58.040
and they said,
"Hey, you wanna try?"

46:58.080 --> 47:00.160
So no one tells me
any of these rules,

47:00.200 --> 47:01.520
so there's these
three little...

47:01.560 --> 47:03.480
-Wickets.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.840
-Stumps.
"

47:04.880 --> 47:06.960
They give me this
paddle-looking thing,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.200
and like, "Just stand there,

47:09.240 --> 47:11.000
and then this guy's
gonna throw to you."

47:11.040 --> 47:13.680
He throws it, it hits
the ground, I'm like, "What?

47:13.720 --> 47:15.640
That's a bad pitch."
And it hits the wickets,

47:15.680 --> 47:17.320
and all the kids start
laughing at me.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.040
"What are you guys laughing
at? Give me another shot!"

47:20.080 --> 47:23.000
So I stand up, pff,
just absolutely destroy it.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.160
It leaves the park, it hits
an apartment building,

47:26.200 --> 47:29.640
and I'm just like,
"I'm the greatest!"

47:29.680 --> 47:31.840
The guy that brought me there
told me

47:31.880 --> 47:33.480
that's the only ball
that they have.

47:36.080 --> 47:39.560
And immediately
I just went, "Oh.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.480
I feel terrible."

47:41.520 --> 47:44.600
"We've had that ball in our
town for three generations."

47:44.640 --> 47:46.160
-They would have.
-Treasure it.

47:46.200 --> 47:49.760
Now, going back to cars,
you, at one stage,

47:49.800 --> 47:52.800
as I understand it,
had a Vauxhall Vectra.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.960
I did.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
And you said
to our researcher

47:56.040 --> 47:57.920
when they called you
the other day,

47:57.960 --> 48:01.760
"I have nothing particularly
interesting to say about
that."

48:01.800 --> 48:04.160
I've been known to be
a straight-shooter.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.920
Put it there.
I once had to do a TV show

48:06.960 --> 48:08.480
where I was asked
to review one of those,

48:08.520 --> 48:10.320
and couldn't think of
a thing.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.960
It was four wheels
and a  seat.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.400
Why did you have one?

48:15.440 --> 48:17.880
The team were sponsored
by Vauxhall.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.640
You were sponsored
by Vauxhall?

48:19.680 --> 48:21.280
Oh, I'd have gone and done
another sport.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.360
Now, we must get
on to why you are here.

48:26.400 --> 48:29.720
Obviously, you're only
the second group of people
we've had around the track.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.520
-It was...

48:31.560 --> 48:33.960
I found it comfortable
on the tar,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.920
but as soon as we veered
off there, it was difficult.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.880
-It was intimidating.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.760
I  loved it!

48:41.800 --> 48:43.680
There were grass clippings
all over the car,

48:43.720 --> 48:47.000
I just took it off-road
a little bit, it was fun.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.240
Yeah, I've been hearing.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.920
We can get it mended
for next week.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.760
Kevin, we're gonna see
your lap first.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.200
OK, let's bring it up
and see how you got on.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.040
JEREMY: Is that
a slow

48:56.080 --> 48:58.800
Oh, no, you're building up
speed as you cross the line.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.440
Come on, Kevin!

49:00.480 --> 49:02.280
JEREMY: Ooh, that's
a determined-looking face.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.880
Clipping the corner,

49:03.920 --> 49:06.200
but keeping two wheels
on the track, nice to see.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.600
Yes, you've done what I do.
You brake there

49:08.640 --> 49:10.160
and then you've got
a slingshot

49:10.200 --> 49:12.280
into what we're calling
the Difficult Bit.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.640
That's when it goes
really skatey as you...

49:14.680 --> 49:16.160
You've really gotta pay...

49:16.200 --> 49:17.800
Ooh, I say,
that's rather good.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.640
For a man who grew up
with a Pulsar.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.480
Kevin, you absolute numpty!

49:22.520 --> 49:25.160
JEREMY: Right, oh, look at
that, it's got the tail out.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.480
KEVIN: Yeah, got the tail
out, got him going good.

49:27.520 --> 49:29.080
JEREMY:
Traction control saved it,

49:29.120 --> 49:31.920
now you can floor it
through to Difficult Bit 2.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.480
KEVIN: Oh, she's going
all right.
-Nicely done.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.120
-That was tough.
-Yeah.

49:37.160 --> 49:39.360
JEREMY: It is a tough bit.
This is really slippery

49:39.400 --> 49:40.880
when you come back
on the Tarmac,

49:40.920 --> 49:42.320
you think that's OK,
and it isn't.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.240
Tyres being
absolutely tortured,

49:46.280 --> 49:47.560
that's looking nice.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.040
Right, onto the straight.

49:49.080 --> 49:51.320
Come on, baby!
Come on, baby!

49:51.360 --> 49:54.480
JEREMY: It's more exciting
than cricket, way more!

49:54.520 --> 49:56.280
As is being asleep.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.160
Were you flat-out
through there?

49:58.200 --> 50:00.200
KEVIN: I was flat-out
through there, then
I messed this up.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.800
JEREMY: Ooh! I'm not...

50:01.840 --> 50:03.440
KEVIN: Yeah, I messed it up,
I missed the curve.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.880
Ballsy flat-out through there,

50:04.920 --> 50:06.960
but you crossed the line,
you did it.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.360
I got it. Time?

50:11.520 --> 50:12.400
So...

50:13.720 --> 50:15.600
Time?

50:15.640 --> 50:17.160
-Patience.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.680
You're a cricketer,
we know you have patience.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.960
OK.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.880
Because what else
is there to have?

50:22.920 --> 50:24.880
-It wasn't bad.
-No, it looked OK.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.480
-Brian.
-Yes.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.120
Come on, let's see Brian's.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.360
KEVIN: Oh.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.240
JEREMY: Right, no creeping
across the line.

50:37.280 --> 50:41.160
And here we go! Yee!

50:41.200 --> 50:43.840
JEREMY: That is a colourful
comb... That's a...

50:43.880 --> 50:46.960
Cheat. He's cheating! Cheat!

50:47.000 --> 50:48.680
He's a cheat!

50:48.720 --> 50:52.200
JEREMY: It's not
Formula One,

50:52.240 --> 50:55.160
we won't penalise him for
this, we have no stewards.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.480
KEVIN: Oh!

50:56.520 --> 50:58.960
JEREMY: Oh, my God!
Coming in hot!

51:00.120 --> 51:01.400
Holding it well, though,

51:01.440 --> 51:04.080
and, I must say,
that is exuberant.

51:04.120 --> 51:07.600
He's on fire!

51:07.640 --> 51:10.560
JEREMY: Into the gravel cell,
the banked gravel corner,

51:10.600 --> 51:12.600
nicely done through there.

51:12.640 --> 51:15.280
Look at those stones
coming off the back of that.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.840
Difficult Bit 2.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.960
Floor it.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
JEREMY: You don't think this
is gonna be slippery but it
is.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.840
Every time, that happens.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.640
Nicely held, though, Brian.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.360
You really do get around.

51:26.400 --> 51:29.720
And there he is, onto the
main straight and relaxing.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.800
Yoo!

51:31.840 --> 51:33.600
JEREMY: Well, not
completely relaxing.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.440
Were you flat through here,
as well?

51:35.480 --> 51:37.400
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.720
BRIAN: I took it...
JEREMY: Flat-out,
that's good.

51:39.760 --> 51:40.800
Braking hard.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.160
Not bad at all.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.320
And there we are, across the
line, that's both of them.

51:55.920 --> 51:59.760
Right. Now, I've got
your times here.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.680
I'll tell you one thing,
they're very, very close.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.160
So you were kind of smooth
and crickety.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.120
-Yeah.
-You were kind of exuberant.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.280
-Yeah.
-They are ridiculously close.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.200
-OK, here we go.
-The suspense.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.520
-I mean, come on.
-Yeah.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.800
-Killing me.
-OK, Kevin.

52:18.480 --> 52:21.040
-1:17.2.

52:21.080 --> 52:23.800
So at the moment,
you're the fastest man

52:23.840 --> 52:26.840
who's ever been
round our track.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.400
-Until...
-This precise moment.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.080
Until about 30 seconds.

52:36.680 --> 52:38.000
Brian Wilson...

52:38.040 --> 52:41.880
-Ooh.
-1:17...

52:41.920 --> 52:43.800
AUDIENCE: Ooh.
-Point one.

52:43.840 --> 52:46.480
-Give it to me.
-..five.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.840
-Damn it!
-Ah!

52:47.880 --> 52:51.160
-Seriously, 0.3 of a second.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.160
Well done, sir.

52:57.160 --> 53:00.560
-That's close.
JEREMY: That is nice.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.840
That is a nice result,
I'm very pleased with that.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.960
And there we are,
you are still the fastest man

53:06.000 --> 53:07.320
who's been round our track.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.240
You have come a long way
for nothing.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.120
Thank you.

53:11.160 --> 53:13.640
JEREMY: Literally nothing...
-Much appreciated.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.800
So, honestly, I mean
it's been an absolute joy

53:15.840 --> 53:18.120
-having you both here...
-Came here for the sheep.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.040
Yeah, no, take one home.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.200
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

53:22.240 --> 53:25.520
Brian Wilson, and the fastest
person who makes a living

53:25.560 --> 53:27.880
by throwing and hitting
and catching small balls,

53:27.920 --> 53:30.320
-Kevin Pietersen!

53:32.160 --> 53:33.840
KEVIN: Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

53:37.680 --> 53:38.920
Right.

53:38.960 --> 53:43.680
Now, this week
we are having a race

53:43.720 --> 53:46.840
from Central Park in New York
to Niagara Falls,

53:46.880 --> 53:49.480
and it's Jeremy
in the new Ford GT

53:49.520 --> 53:51.160
against James and me

53:51.200 --> 53:53.520
in a whole selection
of public transport.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.200
Yes, and when
we left the action,

53:55.240 --> 53:57.640
Jeremy was miles ahead
in the car,

53:57.680 --> 54:00.240
slowly going deaf
from the drone of the engine.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.960
But now we were
about to haul him in

54:03.000 --> 54:06.160
as we boarded
the flight to Buffalo.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.360
RICHARD: Ow!
JAMES: Sorry.

54:22.400 --> 54:26.080
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way, I'm in a race.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.320
Hello. Hello.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.160
Don't get in the way
of someone

54:32.200 --> 54:35.680
who's just given up
a 43-year smoking habit.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.760
JEREMY: Meanwhile...

54:37.800 --> 54:39.240
JAMES: Has he got to go
in that?

54:39.280 --> 54:40.160
MAN: Yes.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.840
OK, see you on board.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.560
STEWARD: Welcome aboard.
-Hello. Thank you.

54:50.600 --> 54:51.560
Oh, God.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.560
Hello. Hello.

54:57.760 --> 54:59.360
Yeah.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.760
OK.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.000
JEREMY: Having covered
160 miles,

55:10.040 --> 55:14.880
the GT's tiny tank
was now nearly empty.

55:14.920 --> 55:20.280
This is a splash-and-dash.
Right, petroleum.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.560
Oh, please let it not be

55:21.600 --> 55:23.440
one of those stupid
American ones

55:23.480 --> 55:25.520
where I've gotta pay first,
I don't know how much I want.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.840
Sadly, it was.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.920
No. Not a debit card.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.040
I haven't got one... Ah.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.920
What?

55:40.960 --> 55:43.320
PA: All exits are marked
with a sign overhead...

55:43.360 --> 55:46.440
It's very unusual
having business class
at the back, isn't it?

55:46.480 --> 55:48.720
Imagine what it's like
at the front.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.520
Must be sort of like there.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.920
It's quite good if you sit at
the back in business class,

55:52.960 --> 55:54.480
survey the whole aeroplane.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.760
This is an Embraer 190.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.640
I can tell you a bit about
these actually.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.040
PA: Prepare for departure.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.720
Oh, dear, you can't,
he's talking.

56:03.760 --> 56:05.840
JEREMY: Hello. Can I...
The pump says...

56:05.880 --> 56:07.440
It's just coming up
"not approved".

56:07.480 --> 56:09.600
Does it have a chip?
It's probably the chip.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.120
How do I pay? Cos...

56:11.160 --> 56:13.040
I'll turn the pump on,
you pump what you need

56:13.080 --> 56:15.200
and I'll let you run
the card when you're done.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.520
Thank you so much.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.360
If you talk like Hugh Grant,
you can get anywhere.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.400
Any minute now, Richard
Hammond and James May

56:28.440 --> 56:31.480
will be thinking,
"Mmm, a beer, I think."

56:34.000 --> 56:36.960
Anyway, here we go,
let's catch him up.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.200
Definitely.

56:44.080 --> 56:47.200
I think we should celebrate
our progress right now,

56:47.240 --> 56:48.800
as we're moving so well.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.240
-Hello.
-Hello.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.400
JAMES: Hi.

56:52.440 --> 56:55.720
-Two beers, please.
-Let me see.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.520
So, as it turns out,

56:57.560 --> 57:00.400
unfortunately I won't be able
to serve you any beer today.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.360
Can I offer you a water,
Coke, Sprite?

57:02.400 --> 57:04.440
-No, I'm sorry.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.320
Wine. Wine? Two glasses
of wine? White wine.

57:07.360 --> 57:08.960
I'm not quite too sure why,

57:09.000 --> 57:10.760
but unfortunately
I won't be able to.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.440
Can I get you
some other beverages?

57:14.360 --> 57:17.360
JEREMY: However, while they
were squashed and thirsty,

57:17.400 --> 57:19.200
there was no getting round
the fact

57:19.240 --> 57:23.120
that they were doing 500mph,
and I wasn't.

57:25.280 --> 57:29.000
Come on, fellow Ford driver,
get out of the way, please.

57:30.320 --> 57:31.560
You've got a Ford!

57:34.400 --> 57:36.320
We are gonna be
reeling him in now.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.360
We're not gonna get stuck
behind anything.

57:38.400 --> 57:39.560
-No.
-In traffic.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.920
No. Nobody is gonna have
a puncture.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.560
Or shed the load
from a pick-up truck.

57:43.600 --> 57:44.480
No.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.840
JEREMY: My biggest problem,
though,

57:49.880 --> 57:53.720
was the woeful
lane discipline.

57:53.760 --> 57:56.480
And you're gonna stay in
that lane, are you, really?

57:58.040 --> 57:59.720
Undertaking.

57:59.760 --> 58:03.320
This is allowed in the
United States and America.

58:05.840 --> 58:10.800
You can see why. People
don't use their mirrors.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.640
It was a problem.

58:12.680 --> 58:16.480
And then there was
a bigger one.

58:16.520 --> 58:20.680
What the hell's this?
I'm in a traffic jam.

58:20.720 --> 58:24.880
A bloody traffic jam. No.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.040
PA: We're about to begin
our descent

58:27.080 --> 58:28.320
into the Buffalo airport.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.000
We'll be on the ground
shortly.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.360
Look.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.800
Is there a fat idiot
in a very fast Ford?

58:33.840 --> 58:36.080
-Nope.
-Good.

58:38.880 --> 58:40.600
Why is there a traffic jam?
And it's a bad one.

58:40.640 --> 58:41.920
Look, we're all stopped.

58:46.040 --> 58:49.240
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.600
Go, go, go, go, go.
Chair, please.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.040
JEREMY: Oh, shit.

59:03.720 --> 59:06.440
There we go. I'm in.

59:07.920 --> 59:12.280
Blimey! Yeah, that is...
I am safe.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.080
JEREMY: Incident.
There's been an accident.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.800
There's the problem. Jesus.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.160
We have some time to make up.

59:23.200 --> 59:26.600
Seeing an accident like that
normally slows you down,

59:26.640 --> 59:27.840
but I couldn't do that.

59:27.880 --> 59:32.120
I was upholding
the honour of the car.

59:32.160 --> 59:35.280
They should be landing
in about ten minutes.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.760
Oh, no.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.360
JEREMY: May

59:41.400 --> 59:44.440
-Yes! Yes.
-James, too loud. Too loud.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.640
-Shit.
JAMES: Where are you?

59:46.680 --> 59:49.960
I'm 130 miles from Buffalo.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.600
He's 130 miles away.

59:53.640 --> 59:55.240
Well, you better
get a move on then

59:55.280 --> 59:57.960
in your 200 and whatever
it is mile-an-hour car.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.520
I... Oh.

59:59.560 --> 1:00:01.040
JEREMY: That's...
-Keep going.

1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:03.080
Oh, for God's.... Shut up.

1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:04.400
JAMES: Bye.

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:08.080
Right,
where do we get the bus?

1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:11.360
JAMES: We now only had a
couple of dozen miles to go.

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:13.080
We'd catch a bus
into Buffalo

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:14.880
and then another
to the finish line

1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:16.360
at the Niagara Falls.

1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:20.800
Trying to think
where this went wrong.

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:23.120
George Washington Bridge,
that didn't help.

1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:26.840
The accident and the
traffic jam that resulted,
that didn't help.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:28.440
But I think the main problem

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:30.960
is that Jet Blue
managed to do

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.800
an hour and 15 minute flight
in an hour.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.680
RICHARD: Oh, I say.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:39.720
JAMES: Oh, I see,
it folds out like that?

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:42.040
RICHARD: That's very clever.
JAMES: Here we go.

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:44.800
RICHARD: Thank you.
JAMES: Aligned.

1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:47.040
-There's a wheelchair
section right over there.
-Thank you very much.

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:53.280
Come on. Yay!

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:57.360
The Trump enthusiast
has pulled over!

1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:02.160
Right, let's find out
where he is.

1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:08.160
It's Mr Bell End.
Hammond, where are you?

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:10.720
Leaving the airport on a bus.

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:14.200
Right. Well,
I'm 90 miles behind you.

1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:18.440
You're gonna
have to make that up
in no time.

1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:21.200
How far are you
from Niagara Falls now?

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:23.520
23 miles.

1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:27.240
RICHARD: I'd say
you could be doomed.

1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:30.320
Good luck,
we're getting closer. Bye.

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:31.280
He's never gonna do it.

1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:38.480
Oh! I don't want this car
to lose, I properly love it.

1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:39.920
It's just so exciting.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:42.560
All the things that make it
bad and annoying

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:44.800
make it brilliant
and exciting.

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:47.920
The noise, and the ride,
and the roughness.

1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:54.040
It's just raucous, raw,
bareback, unplugged energy.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:01.200
I want it to win,
I want it to beat the plane.

1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:04.560
But to do that, it
would have to do 113 miles

1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:08.360
in the time it takes a bus
to do 23.

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:10.080
PA: Stop requested.

1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:11.200
JEREMY: Luckily, however,

1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:13.960
buses have other people
on them.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.200
JAMES: I don't like this bit.
What do you do?

1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:17.840
You just have to sit here.

1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:20.440
Yeah. Bus travel
is tricky to like, isn't it?

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:22.320
And we've gotta stop
and change buses,

1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:25.400
and if we lose ten,
15 minutes waiting for
the next bus...

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:27.000
I know, it's not in the bag.

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.040
76 miles.

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.880
PA: Stop requested.

1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:37.840
Who pulled the...

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:42.280
Well, it is a bus with...
Can't be rude to customers.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:44.840
Nobody else pull the string
until we've got off, please.

1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:45.920
Let's just go all the way.

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.240
Hello. Where are you?

1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:58.840
I think about 55 miles away
from the finish line.

1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:00.680
-Yeah.

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.160
Right, this is
gonna be close.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.680
Have you not got
to Buffalo yet?

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:06.520
No, no, we're in Buffalo,

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:09.200
but we haven't got
to the bus change point.

1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.880
Oh, really? Oh!
Does your bus keep stopping?

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.120
Well, of course it does,
it's a bloody bus!

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:18.120
I haven't been on one
since I was eight.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:19.960
That kept stopping.

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.280
I thought, "I won't go on
another one, they're stupid."

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:24.040
-They're still the same.
-Bye-bye.

1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:29.520
JEREMY: Amazingly,
I was still in the running,

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.600
but my furious pace meant
I had to make a decision.

1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:37.760
Do I drive like Al Gore would
want me to drive, at 55mph,

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:39.640
and possibly make
the finish line

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.040
without having
to fill up again,

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:43.640
or do I floor it,
go really quickly,

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.120
and have a quick
splash

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:49.200
Do I risk running out...
Oh, no, I can't.

1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:54.720
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
not that far ahead,

1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:58.080
we had reached
the bus station.

1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:01.200
And James, incredibly,
was doing running.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.000
JAMES: Where the hell is it?

1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:04.960
Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls.
48, look.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.880
It's that one there.
In we go.

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:09.920
Right, we need
a swift departure.

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:11.720
Hello!
Oh! He's missed the ramp.

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:14.520
This is so irritating.

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:17.720
I've got 35 miles to go,
that's all,

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:19.520
but I'm not gonna make it
on the fuel,

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:20.800
I just know I'm not.

1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:23.680
I'm gonna have to fill up.
Argh!

1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:28.320
-Yeah.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.040
It's 35 miles.
Four gallons will do it.

1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:38.320
That will do.

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.200
PA: Now approaching
Mohawk Street.

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:44.560
No need to stop.

1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:46.360
No, no need to stop,
we're all fine.

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:50.160
Ah, roadworks!

1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:54.880
-Ten miles, Richard Hammond.

1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:00.080
Yes, joy of joys,
two actual lanes open.

1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:10.200
Get a bloody move on!

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.440
12 million people a year
visit Niagara Falls.

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:17.160
Do they?

1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:19.520
I want them all to get in
Jeremy's way, but not ours.

1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:22.960
Yes, Niagara Falls.

1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:32.400
No, no, no. No, a toll. Argh!

1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:34.840
Luckily, though,
I had an electronic pass,

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:37.160
which made paying
much faster.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.600
See, Hammond,
it's right there. See it?

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:41.160
-Yeah.

1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:42.720
RICHARD: Yeah.

1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:48.320
It's not working. No!

1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.040
Right.

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:04.880
PA: Stop requested.

1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:11.440
-This is our stop.

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.040
-Yeah.
-Right.

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:20.440
Four miles.

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:25.680
-Are you gonna have
a heart attack on television?

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:26.600
Yeah.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:29.360
Don't wanna lose this.

1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:34.600
What's it say there? "Falls".

1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:48.560
Right, this is it.

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:53.920
Where the hell are they?

1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:59.280
There's the
observation tower.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:01.560
There is the
observation tower,
that's where I'm headed.

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.880
Dicky wheel.

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:15.120
Ah! Oh! I have been turned
into Richard Hammond
by six hours in that car.

1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:18.680
This is it.
There's the bridge thing.

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.080
Oh, God. Jesus.

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:23.360
-In we go.
-Howdy.

1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:24.960
Ooh.

1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:32.560
Oh, God,
so it all comes down to,

1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:34.520
is he the other side
of this barrier?

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:37.240
Can you get that door,
Hammond?

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.640
Yeah, I got it, got it,
got it.

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:44.920
Oh. Hang on. Oh. Look.

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:47.560
Let me sit down, sorry.
Put the brake on.

1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:51.600
How long you been here?

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:53.480
Long enough
to do some nice pictures

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:55.720
-and some Instagram work.
RICHARD: Oh, good.

1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:57.280
JEREMY:
Why are you so tired?

1:07:57.320 --> 1:07:59.480
I've been pushing him uphill!

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:01.760
RICHARD: He doesn't like it.
-He's actually sweating.

1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:05.040
-He's been running!
-I've run on the internet.

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:06.960
I thought he might have
a heart attack.

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.320
James May is going to die
live on TV.

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:13.840
I'm gonna do it here,
just talk amongst yourselves.

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:26.240
The gloating gets worse.

1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:30.880
So there we are, the answer
to the question that no one
was asking is:

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:35.200
Yes, the Ford GT
is faster than an airliner.

1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:37.160
No, it's faster than a bus.

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:39.040
And it crippled you
and made you deaf.

1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.720
He didn't exactly arrive
in tip

1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:43.360
No, but hang on,

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.600
that's because I had to
push him around all day,

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:47.000
and it was like having

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:48.760
a massive wheeled suitcase
with an opinion

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:51.240
that pointed at things
like Rommel all the time.

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:54.040
He was the only one who had
a comfortable day, actually.

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:55.120
-You were.
-You were.

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.720
Cos the honest truth is,

1:08:56.760 --> 1:09:00.080
that Ford GT went through
a city and on a motorway,

1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:02.240
and neither
of those environments

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:03.880
is where it's really at home.

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:06.600
Yes, like I said in New York,
it's a racing car.

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:10.040
Yes, which is why
I'm going to get one
brought over to the UK

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.760
and later I'm gonna thrash
it round the Eboladrome.

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:18.040
Well, uh...me?

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:20.880
People wanna know
what it's like on a track,

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:22.320
not what it's like
on its roof.

1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:26.560
And on that terrible
disappointment, for you,

1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:27.800
it's time to end.

1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:30.320
Thank you so much
for watching, goodnight.
