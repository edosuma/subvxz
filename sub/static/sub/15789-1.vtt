00:12.379 --> 00:16.684
<i>We can now confirm the mysterious freezing
conditions falling over Gotham City</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:19.353
<i>are a result of an attack by supervillains</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:24.738
<i>believed to be connected to the sightings
of a giant monster roaming the streets.</i>

01:08.868 --> 01:11.217
Scanning for target.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.920
Target acquired.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.563
Grandfather! No! What?

03:37.952 --> 03:42.623
Oh, Pennyworth. I was pulling
an all-nighter but I guess I fell asleep.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.060
Master Damian, as we've discussed
on previous occasions,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.629
a young man must have adequate rest.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.631
Those who wore the Robin mask
before you all...

03:50.731 --> 03:54.468
Save the lectures, please. Like you didn't
hear about what happened last night.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.237
Last night?

03:56.337 --> 04:00.307
You really didn't hear? Well, don't worry.
The rest of the world has.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.710
A guy on the street
caught it on his handheld.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.158
<i>I've got him, Batman.</i>

04:06.546 --> 04:09.083
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

04:09.183 --> 04:12.486
Let's just say it's a pretty
popular clip online.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.668
<i>Hey, stop filming.</i>

04:16.290 --> 04:20.161
I do see why this has caused you
a measure of distress, Master Damian.

04:20.261 --> 04:24.665
But the clown prince of crime has
long been Batman's greatest enemy.

04:24.815 --> 04:27.485
It is not surprising that you
found yourself at a disadvantage

04:27.585 --> 04:30.087
in your first encounter with him.

04:30.787 --> 04:34.925
Disadvantage!
I accidentally leapt off a building.

04:35.025 --> 04:39.196
If Batman hadn't been there...
I don't think he's happy with me.

04:39.396 --> 04:40.832
I wish Red Robin was here.

04:40.932 --> 04:44.018
It would be good to talk to someone who's
been through the Robin training before.

04:44.118 --> 04:48.139
It is unfortunate that Master Tim's work
with his team keeps him away so much.

04:48.239 --> 04:51.609
- But you could speak with Master Dick.
- Nightwing?

04:51.709 --> 04:55.625
He's not really giving off
come-talk-to-me vibes right now.

05:01.251 --> 05:04.134
Master Bruce. I have prepared tea.

05:07.189 --> 05:09.272
Thank you, Alfred.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.762
Studying. Good.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.831
That's what I was trying
to tell Pennyworth.

05:13.931 --> 05:16.133
I'm familiarizing myself
with your biggest villains.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.570
Not good if it keeps him up all night,
if I may say.

05:19.670 --> 05:22.039
And where have you been, sir?

05:22.139 --> 05:25.726
On patrol. Some trouble
in the Bowery. Handled.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.279
Hey, who is this little guy?

05:28.379 --> 05:31.132
Oswald Cobblepot. The Penguin.

05:31.232 --> 05:34.969
- Criminal kingpin.
- How come I haven't seen him around yet?

05:35.069 --> 05:37.884
I sent him away for a while.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.093
That cursed Batman.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.519
It's all his fault. Did I deserve this?

05:51.619 --> 05:55.401
Being stranded up here for over a year?

05:56.623 --> 06:02.445
I just tried to make Gotham City
a more livable place for criminal...

06:02.763 --> 06:04.498
people like me.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.994
And the Batman always ruins everything.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.371
I should be ruling Gotham City,

06:10.471 --> 06:16.089
not stuck in Mr. Freeze's lab
of half-working machines.

06:17.009 --> 06:20.560
What? I actually caught something.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.066
Bah! Barely a minnow.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.797
You take it, buzz.

06:36.897 --> 06:41.234
You know, you're the only one
here I can talk to.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.651
You understand me.

06:48.675 --> 06:52.213
Oh, is it here?
Where did I put those things?

06:52.313 --> 06:55.761
Oh, great. Mr. Fun is back.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.955
What's got your thermals
in a bunch, Freeze?

07:01.255 --> 07:04.592
Solitude. That's all that I ask for.

07:04.692 --> 07:09.042
And yet wretched humanity
keeps intruding upon me.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.867
Wretched humanity?

07:13.667 --> 07:17.905
If this is your way of saying you
don't want me as a roommate anymore,

07:18.005 --> 07:19.673
the feeling's mutual.

07:19.773 --> 07:24.445
Just drop me off in Gotham City.
I won't take it personally.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.781
No, not you, Penguin.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.230
My territory has been invaded.

07:32.353 --> 07:36.623
A new oil drilling platform
here on the ice pack?

07:36.723 --> 07:39.944
Maybe they can get me
back to civilization.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.379
For the 1,000th time,

07:42.479 --> 07:46.633
you'll be much happier once
you've turned your back on humanity.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.682
Living among them brings nothing but...

07:50.637 --> 07:52.652
misery.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.822
Here we go.

07:57.377 --> 08:01.193
- What's that?
- One of my inventions.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.285
The key to our solitude.

08:04.385 --> 08:08.072
Our solitude? Great.

08:08.172 --> 08:12.826
My device can transform a simple
animal like this tiny isopod,

08:12.926 --> 08:15.241
into a monster.

08:41.587 --> 08:46.138
Yes. We shall defend what is ours.

08:47.243 --> 08:49.392
Come, beast!

08:53.599 --> 08:58.084
Come on, Buzz.
We might as well see the show.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.471
Drill coming in. Get ready for setup.

09:24.096 --> 09:28.219
Your occupation of my land
must come to an end.

09:28.319 --> 09:31.567
You shall return from whence you came.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.509
Don't feign ignorance, you gadflies.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.623
My monster.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.861
Attack!

10:02.702 --> 10:09.143
Now, fools, you know the consequences
of crossing Dr. Victor Fries.

10:09.243 --> 10:14.198
Well, Mr. Freeze is crazy.
But he's always entertaining.

10:14.298 --> 10:17.618
How could you even hope
to defend yourselves?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.987
You are powerless.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.923
Victor, they are roughnecks.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.473
Obviously here to drill.
They might have...

10:29.228 --> 10:31.177
Yeah, one of those.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.974
Darn! How dare you defy me.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.434
- In your face!
- Laugh while you can.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.050
My next monster will eradicate you!

11:12.204 --> 11:14.722
Next monster?

11:19.712 --> 11:21.698
Victor, wait!

11:21.798 --> 11:24.868
Leave me alone. I need to plan.

11:24.968 --> 11:29.218
You want better monsters.
I think I can help.

11:29.789 --> 11:34.194
How? You had better be serious, Oswald.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.864
I have never been more serious.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.701
However, to pull it off,
we have to return...

11:40.801 --> 11:42.603
to Gotham City.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.322
Is this one of your tricks?

11:45.422 --> 11:48.488
I assure you, far from it.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.160
What are you waiting for? To Gotham.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.142
Yes. To Gotham.

12:13.466 --> 12:18.605
Why so sad, Buzz? You don't think
I'd leave you behind, do you?

12:18.705 --> 12:23.189
I need you to keep an eye
on this madman for me.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.565
I am confident, sir, that today's
obligation to Wayne Enterprises

12:44.665 --> 12:46.233
is present in your thoughts.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.469
I haven't forgotten, Alfred.

12:48.569 --> 12:52.389
The new technology showcase
at Wayne tower? That's today?

12:52.489 --> 12:55.293
In less than 10 minutes.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.012
Isn't that super important?
We'll never make it in time.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.662
Yes, we will. Get in.

13:04.084 --> 13:08.301
- Alfred, you're on logistical support.
- Of course, sir.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.051
- When do I get to drive?
- We'll see.

13:21.151 --> 13:23.020
- Soon?
- We'll see.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.705
- I hope it's soon.
- Remember,

13:24.805 --> 13:29.176
this is going to be a Wayne Enterprises
function. So, we have to wear our costumes.

13:29.276 --> 13:33.793
- We're already wearing our costumes.
- These are our work uniforms.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.932
Stupid costume.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.274
Gross! Who would eat this?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.650
That couldn't be what it sounds like.

14:02.274 --> 14:06.280
Hilarious, Madam Senator.
I'll definitely have to avoid that vintage.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.316
Wow. He's so friendly.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.852
Yeah, it freaked me out
the first time I saw it, too.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.389
- Oh. Hi, Mr. Green Arrow.
- Watch it, Damian.

14:15.489 --> 14:18.971
Here, it's Mr. Queen. Call me Ollie.

14:19.492 --> 14:23.430
Sorry, Ollie. Add that to the pile
of rookie mistakes I've been making.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.366
Yeah, go easy on yourself, kiddo.
We were all new once.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.687
And you're training under him. That's like
jumping into the deep end of the ocean.

14:30.787 --> 14:34.958
Bat... the boss doesn't seem
very happy with me.

14:35.623 --> 14:38.111
Not talking much. Acting grumpy.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.547
- Yeah.
- That's just the way he is.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.716
Green Lantern took him
to a theme planet once.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.218
The whole planet, one big amusement park.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.755
I asked him how it was,
you know what he said? Enjoyable.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.291
- That's it.
- Because he doesn't care.

14:51.391 --> 14:56.730
Wrong. It's the opposite.
Underneath, he cares more than any of us.

14:56.830 --> 15:01.335
He has the biggest heart of all.
That's why he has to hide it so well.

15:01.785 --> 15:06.540
- Mr. Wayne, I presume.
- Yes. And you must be general Sam Lane.

15:06.640 --> 15:11.144
You've done your research. I'm responsible
for the military's technology budget.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.648
And if today's demonstration
goes as well as it's supposed to,

15:14.748 --> 15:17.638
I'm going to make you an even richer man.

15:17.738 --> 15:21.054
In that case,
I'm very pleased you're here, general.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.924
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
If I could have your attention.</i>

15:24.024 --> 15:25.960
<i>I am Dr. Kurt Langstrom,</i>

15:26.060 --> 15:30.130
<i>the head of Wayne Enterprises research
and development department.</i>

15:30.230 --> 15:33.779
<i>Wayne Enterprises has long produced
high tech drilling sledges</i>

15:33.879 --> 15:35.903
<i>for mining in extreme conditions.</i>

15:36.003 --> 15:39.852
<i>Now, welcome to the next level.</i>

15:45.645 --> 15:49.243
<i>This single operator
drilling mech's plasma pincers</i>

15:49.343 --> 15:54.166
<i>actually turn solid rock into lava
to safely pass through.</i>

15:59.793 --> 16:02.829
<i>We designed the mech
for mining exploration and extraction.</i>

16:02.929 --> 16:05.315
- Alfred.
- <i>Emergency, sir.</i>

16:05.415 --> 16:08.130
<i>A break-in at Arkham Asylum.</i>

16:09.034 --> 16:11.739
- You mean a breakout.
- <i>No, sir. In.</i>

16:11.839 --> 16:15.483
<i>This technology could one day be used
to explore the core of the Earth,</i>

16:15.583 --> 16:19.563
<i>or even other planets.
The potential is nearly endless.</i>

16:19.663 --> 16:22.047
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

16:22.616 --> 16:26.586
Well, Mr. Wayne.
I have to say I'm very impressed.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.288
You could...

16:28.388 --> 16:30.602
Mr. Wayne?

16:40.933 --> 16:43.590
Seal off the perimeter.
Full lockdown protocols.

16:43.690 --> 16:45.731
Get to your stations, people.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.563
That's coming from...

17:04.791 --> 17:08.994
Something tells me you don't have
a license to drive this thing.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.464
No one can issue me a license,

17:11.564 --> 17:17.282
for there is no government that holds
authority over Dr. Victor Fries.

17:18.988 --> 17:20.705
Freeze!

17:20.806 --> 17:22.833
Exactly.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.823
In the name of the Gotham
Police Arkham division,

17:36.923 --> 17:38.725
I demand you give yourselves up.

17:38.825 --> 17:42.236
You're the best Arkham has to offer?

17:43.230 --> 17:46.099
It's embarrassing
I've ever been kept in here.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.301
Stay focused, Cobblepot.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.505
You promised me what we need
is somewhere in here.

17:51.605 --> 17:55.409
I've already spent more time among
other humans than I am comfortable with.

17:57.297 --> 17:59.796
You won't be disappointed.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.916
Release me. I shouldn't be in here.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.685
That's what they all say.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.054
What are you guys doing
trapped in that hallway?

18:08.154 --> 18:11.137
Don't you want to be free in here like me?

18:11.623 --> 18:14.340
Okay, freak show.

18:22.434 --> 18:26.223
I don't deserve to be free of here.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.809
I was going to say the same thing.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.444
Where are the items we need?

18:31.544 --> 18:36.283
Patience. I waited for months
in your mad scientist igloo.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.865
You can wait a few moments more.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.603
First on the list.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.969
What do you two want?

18:56.069 --> 18:58.884
Time to come with us, Bane.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.263
Why do you want me out?

19:06.363 --> 19:08.765
Explanations in good time.

19:08.865 --> 19:12.848
Or we can always close you back in.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.172
Good decision.

19:25.831 --> 19:30.616
Chemo! We have a deal
you might be interested in.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.028
Always impressive, Killer Croc.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.430
This cell is vacant, you fool.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.701
<i>Au contraire.</i>

20:04.704 --> 20:09.188
Clayface, meet your new boss, Mr. Freeze.

20:21.455 --> 20:26.259
No, you wouldn't forget little old me
in your escape plans, would you?

20:26.359 --> 20:31.098
Because that wouldn't be funny,
if I do say so myself.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.767
Sorry, Clown.

20:33.867 --> 20:37.187
I already have to deal
with one lunatic on this job.

20:37.287 --> 20:42.742
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.
You need me. I am the style.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.546
I will put the life in your team's party.

20:46.646 --> 20:50.533
I'd get used to your new
accommodations if I were you.

20:50.633 --> 20:53.937
I have an absolutely awful memory, Oswald.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.971
But this I won't forget, do you hear me?

21:05.397 --> 21:09.414
- Why are we waiting?
- I'm scanning.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.456
Always use caution, Robin.

21:13.556 --> 21:17.611
Leaping into Arkham unprepared
is like going into a lion's den.

21:18.111 --> 21:22.094
I've always loved the lion's den.
It's my favorite part of the zoo.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.666
I'm thinking he's not great at caution.

21:34.176 --> 21:39.249
What did I say? Checking off everything
on our shopping list was easy.

21:39.349 --> 21:43.069
Wait. You don't expect me
to work with this snake, do you?

21:43.169 --> 21:45.939
He sold me out to the Gotham police.

21:46.039 --> 21:49.276
You got a score to settle?
Then let's settle it.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.212
Gentlemen, now is not the time.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.161
We should be on our way before Batman...

21:59.084 --> 22:01.855
This game ends now.

22:01.955 --> 22:06.093
Game? Trust me, we are not playing.

22:06.193 --> 22:09.696
Really? Because I could go for a round
of pin-the-arrow-on-the-bad-guy.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.886
Who wants to go first?

22:13.565 --> 22:18.071
- Good work, Robin. We'll take it from here.
- Gordon? You made it to Arkham quickly.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.490
- Kid, duck.
- You crazy?

22:20.590 --> 22:22.704
Do it now.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.615
- Yeah.
- This guy wasn't in my holobook.

22:27.715 --> 22:31.096
You're learning how to be
a superhero from a book?

22:43.528 --> 22:45.911
We're wasting time.

22:56.675 --> 22:59.345
Great, you've trapped us in here.

22:59.445 --> 23:02.194
You are a shortsighted little man.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.799
Bane.

23:24.369 --> 23:28.007
They escaped.
There are sewer tunnels underneath here.

23:28.107 --> 23:31.111
They had a vehicle waiting. They're gone.

23:31.211 --> 23:34.078
This wouldn't have happened if I could tell
the difference between the real Gordon

23:34.178 --> 23:37.262
- and Clayface.
- You're still learning, kid.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.131
I guess.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.795
What's the big mystery?
Penguin and Freeze needed some muscle,

23:48.895 --> 23:51.464
freed some inmates, simple as that.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.250
On the surface it looks simple.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.904
- You think there's a pattern here?
- The breakout wasn't random.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.641
They skipped others to select Bane,
Chemo, Croc and Clayface.

24:01.741 --> 24:04.410
Why them? It's not a solid team.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.446
Bane and Croc have a known rivalry.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.582
We don't need to know what they want.
We just need to stop them.

24:09.682 --> 24:13.353
The key to stopping them
is outsmarting them.

24:13.453 --> 24:17.203
Unless you have explosive arrows,
then that's the key to stopping them.

24:17.303 --> 24:19.838
Oh, and look what I've got.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.579
A pattern.

25:01.116 --> 25:03.002
If this is a trick...

25:03.102 --> 25:08.441
You will no doubt inflict
bodily injury upon me. Yes. Yes.

25:08.541 --> 25:12.078
Your threats are <i>de rigueur.</i> Do not worry.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.660
My science is no hoax.

25:27.260 --> 25:31.197
What's that little guy's name? Appetizer?

25:31.297 --> 25:34.117
Buzz here is my hench-bird.

25:34.217 --> 25:38.351
Don't mind him, Buzz.
He's a mere sewer-born cretin.

25:40.140 --> 25:43.576
Level with me, Penguin.
What are the odds this is going to work?

25:43.676 --> 25:47.380
Victor Fries is a loony
with a monster size ego.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.416
He's practically a hermit
and on top of it all,

25:50.516 --> 25:52.585
he's a terrible roommate.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.655
But he's also one other thing.

25:55.755 --> 25:59.638
- What's that?
- A genius.

26:00.108 --> 26:03.225
Time for the moment of truth.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.031
Criminal history. No connection.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.901
Known MOs. No connection.

26:42.001 --> 26:46.138
Personality profile. No connection.

26:46.238 --> 26:50.092
Maybe they're just recruiting
for an all-villain flag football league.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.746
What if Penguin and Freeze didn't
pick these guys for who they are,

26:53.846 --> 26:56.082
but instead, for what they're made of?

26:56.182 --> 26:59.902
- Made of? What does it matter?
- Never mind. Probably nothing.

27:00.002 --> 27:02.072
Tell me.

27:02.522 --> 27:05.691
Well, three of them have
unusual chemical components.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.594
Bane's venom,
the stuff that makes him strong,

27:08.694 --> 27:11.831
Clayface's mud,
which can expand into anything,

27:11.931 --> 27:16.336
and Chemo, well, he's basically
made of super toxic sludge.

27:16.436 --> 27:19.038
What about Croc? He's not like the others.

27:19.138 --> 27:23.109
No, but the strength of his constitution
would make him an ideal test subject.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.779
Mr. Freeze is a scientist, right?
What if he's experimenting?

27:26.879 --> 27:30.515
No offense, kid, but don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.987
- No.
- Okay. Dumb idea.

27:34.287 --> 27:36.456
I mean, no, it's not a stretch.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.892
- It's not?
- I was focusing on the villains' skills.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.879
It never occurred to me to analyze
their physical composition.

27:42.979 --> 27:44.340
Good work, Robin.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.968
To force those kind of chemicals
to interact with one another,

27:49.068 --> 27:53.051
there'll be tell-tale signs
in chroma-spectral scans of the area.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.442
Got a hit. Robin, with me.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.444
- Where to?
- Gotham Harbor.

27:58.544 --> 28:02.982
I'll follow in a second.
In the meantime, this cup is getting low.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.563
Indeed, sir.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.723
It is done.

29:14.370 --> 29:16.618
How will you know if it worked?

29:19.724 --> 29:22.211
There's only one way to find out.

29:22.311 --> 29:24.593
Lay it on me.

29:36.903 --> 29:41.793
Yes. I feel it. The power.

30:47.747 --> 30:50.728
It's time to have a little fun.

31:15.952 --> 31:18.539
- Hey.
- It's amazing.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.195
Hey, do superheroes get snow days?

31:58.249 --> 32:02.162
That's a no, I guess.
Sudden weather shifts. Icy conditions.

32:02.262 --> 32:04.273
Part of Mr. Freeze's plans, I assume.

32:04.373 --> 32:07.493
- No doubt.
- You know, if you let me drive,

32:07.593 --> 32:10.530
you could focus on developing
the perfect plan for fighting Freeze.

32:10.830 --> 32:13.211
Not the time, Robin.

32:19.470 --> 32:23.643
- You're seeing this, right?
- Like you said, Chemo's asset mutates.

32:23.743 --> 32:26.729
Clayface's mud stretches.
Bane's venom enlarges.

32:26.829 --> 32:31.451
But I didn't know that meant giant,
crazy monster. What do we do?

32:34.233 --> 32:36.352
Here it comes.

32:38.423 --> 32:42.274
Now, let's cause some chaos.

32:56.958 --> 32:59.862
What's this? An old friend.

32:59.962 --> 33:04.663
I should spend some time with him,
now that I've come up in the world.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.988
- You wearing your seat belt?
- Always.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.445
Good.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.658
Oh, yeah? Bring it.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.534
Hey, guys, a minute ago I was having
coffee in Paris when I saw the news.

33:21.634 --> 33:24.215
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

33:28.139 --> 33:30.221
What the...

33:38.516 --> 33:40.698
There goes the Flash.

33:49.841 --> 33:51.693
What?

34:03.041 --> 34:06.612
Hi, Mr. Croc. Good to see you?

34:06.712 --> 34:09.995
Goodbye for good, Batman.

34:26.731 --> 34:30.581
It turns into a plane?
This is the coolest thing ever.

34:35.306 --> 34:38.610
Any chance this thing also transforms
into an enormous heat lamp?

34:38.710 --> 34:41.617
We stop the monsters,
the climate will go back to normal.

34:41.981 --> 34:46.051
Right. Wait, monsters?
As in more than one?

34:46.150 --> 34:47.933
Look down.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.043
Freeze is turning
Gotham City into the arctic.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.069
It's better than I could have ever hoped.

35:04.169 --> 35:08.657
Soon I won't need this blasted suit
to cool me down anymore.

35:08.757 --> 35:11.343
What did I tell you, Victor?

35:11.443 --> 35:15.414
You were so focused on defending
your little ice cave,

35:15.514 --> 35:17.982
you weren't thinking big.

35:18.082 --> 35:20.186
Yes, you're right.

35:20.386 --> 35:24.569
I have been underestimating
myself, haven't I?

35:28.693 --> 35:31.697
Oh, yes, Victor. Look at that screen.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.980
See all that you can accomplish.

36:27.579 --> 36:30.502
No! Oh, my goodness.

36:40.298 --> 36:42.501
Nightwing. Thank you.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.671
- Oh, such a good boy.
- No problem, ma'am.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.324
You all need to find safety indoors.

36:48.424 --> 36:50.409
An avalanche in downtown Gotham?

36:50.509 --> 36:54.179
Give you one guess who's behind this
and it rhymes with "sister please."

36:54.279 --> 36:56.849
How did Mr. Freeze
get power on this scale?

36:56.949 --> 36:58.751
Ask Batman or the new Robin
for the details.

36:58.851 --> 37:01.766
But I, for one, never wanted
to live in a snow globe.

37:04.655 --> 37:07.672
Oh, yeah, and then there's that.

37:16.801 --> 37:21.206
Thanks to you, I realize
I don't have to hide from civilization.

37:21.306 --> 37:26.045
I can turn civilization into what I want,
an ice world.

37:26.145 --> 37:29.782
Ice world? Not everywhere, I hope.

37:29.882 --> 37:33.502
I didn't pay for a private island
so it could freeze over.

37:33.602 --> 37:35.938
Of course everywhere!

37:36.038 --> 37:39.508
Now, because of you, I think big!

37:39.608 --> 37:43.225
A new global ice age!

38:03.965 --> 38:08.037
- He doesn't even seem to know we're here.
- Then it's time to drop the subtlety.

38:08.137 --> 38:10.785
A barrage of missiles is subtle?

38:20.983 --> 38:23.865
What are you doing? Isn't that
the button that turns off the jets?

38:34.712 --> 38:37.746
- There, he noticed us.
- I think you made him mad.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.538
You know what? Maybe I don't
want to drive this thing anymore.

39:07.745 --> 39:10.160
Open fire!

39:16.854 --> 39:19.236
It's not affecting him.

39:34.055 --> 39:37.572
Smashing up the GCPD.

39:40.995 --> 39:43.578
I knew this day would come.

39:58.346 --> 40:00.527
Need a lift?

40:02.950 --> 40:05.266
At least they're safe.

40:09.023 --> 40:11.739
We would never forget you, Commissioner.

40:21.068 --> 40:25.140
Frozen. Shining. Perfect.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.609
A wasteland paradise.

40:27.709 --> 40:30.045
Everything I've ever dreamed.

40:30.145 --> 40:33.194
Cold enough to ditch the suit yet?

40:34.348 --> 40:36.850
Yes, I think it is.

40:47.562 --> 40:49.898
Finally free.

40:49.998 --> 40:53.635
I am glad you are here to see
the beginning of all this, Oswald.

40:53.735 --> 40:57.706
- You were instrumental.
- Sure. Happy to help.

40:57.806 --> 41:01.744
But your usefulness has come to an end.

41:02.144 --> 41:05.030
But... but we're partners.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.999
I'm no fool, Penguin.

41:07.149 --> 41:11.220
You wanted to return to Gotham
for one reason, to rule it.

41:11.320 --> 41:16.324
Now that I do rule it, this makes me
your number one enemy.

41:16.424 --> 41:17.826
Nonsense!

41:17.926 --> 41:21.563
Perhaps, but that's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

41:21.663 --> 41:24.733
You'll never get
the upper hand on me, Penguin.

41:25.977 --> 41:29.884
Sorry, Victor, but I already have.

41:33.007 --> 41:37.229
- No! No, you couldn't have.
- But I did.

41:37.329 --> 41:40.582
The power is great.

41:40.682 --> 41:44.199
This was worth the wait!

41:46.970 --> 41:50.004
Nothing can stop me now!

41:52.761 --> 41:56.431
Croc was a durable test subject.
But the others?

41:56.531 --> 41:59.768
Do you have any idea
how unstable they are?

41:59.868 --> 42:03.538
Do you have any idea how little I care?

42:03.638 --> 42:06.074
And without the defenses
in your freeze suit,

42:06.174 --> 42:09.378
there's nothing you can do to stop me.

42:09.478 --> 42:11.726
You'll never get away with this.

42:13.648 --> 42:15.930
Looks like he will.

42:17.084 --> 42:19.121
Bring me the Batman.

42:19.221 --> 42:21.890
He'll pay for putting me in exile.

42:21.990 --> 42:27.262
And then Gotham will finally,
rightfully, belong to me.

42:27.362 --> 42:31.812
- You bet.
- Got a score to settle first.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.365
Hey, Nightwing.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.246
Good to see you.
You must not be getting my texts.

42:44.346 --> 42:46.445
- I got them.
- Oh, but...

42:46.545 --> 42:49.563
More urgent stuff
to deal with right now, Flash.

43:01.445 --> 43:05.133
- Can't say I expected to see that today.
- Can't say I expected to any of this today.

43:05.233 --> 43:07.502
Come on, guys, this is Gotham.

43:07.602 --> 43:10.272
Time to settle up, Croc.

43:10.372 --> 43:12.520
Happy to.

43:22.216 --> 43:26.055
Batman, it's Nightwing. It looks like
our big problem just got even bigger.

43:26.655 --> 43:28.357
I have eyes on it, too.

43:28.457 --> 43:31.739
We have to shut them down
before Gotham is destroyed.

43:41.735 --> 43:44.652
- Good work, Robin.
- There you are.

43:47.809 --> 43:52.694
What's happening to me?
Freeze's formula, it's...

43:59.053 --> 44:02.725
He's unstable. Whatever freeze did,
Clayface can't handle it.

44:03.325 --> 44:06.140
Here, it's the key.

44:07.161 --> 44:10.666
- You said you wanted to drive the Batmobile.
- I kinda took that back.

44:10.766 --> 44:12.968
I've got a plan,
but I need you to buy me time,

44:13.068 --> 44:16.071
try to keep Clayface from destroying
the city until I get back.

44:16.171 --> 44:19.508
- That's a pretty tall order.
- I know you can do it.

44:19.608 --> 44:21.889
You need a ride?

44:22.176 --> 44:25.247
- I've got one.
- Is your ride invisible?

44:25.347 --> 44:27.428
Wait for it.

44:29.517 --> 44:32.854
A new batcycle! Nice!

44:32.954 --> 44:35.770
You'll have to show me
how to get the spikes to work...

44:37.057 --> 44:39.217
He does that to everyone, doesn't he?

44:40.961 --> 44:44.978
Even... even better!

44:45.816 --> 44:51.056
Instead of crushing you,
now I'll burn you!

44:51.156 --> 44:54.578
Okay, what does he usually do?
This is the ignition, right?

44:59.046 --> 45:01.162
Can't run from me.

45:16.630 --> 45:20.181
I don't know what I was worried about.
This is awesome!

45:20.868 --> 45:24.152
How do you do plane mode? Plane mode now!

45:28.909 --> 45:30.426
Oh, yeah!

45:38.152 --> 45:40.335
Eat missiles, lava breath!

45:51.181 --> 45:53.398
Where is he?

45:56.971 --> 46:01.126
- Time to go to the workshop.
- Batman, it... it's not ready.

46:01.226 --> 46:05.046
Giant monsters are loose in Gotham.
Consider this a field test.

46:05.146 --> 46:07.524
Don't start without me.

46:09.884 --> 46:12.087
There you are!

46:12.187 --> 46:15.690
- What are you doing here?
- You'll see.

46:15.790 --> 46:19.728
- The magnetometer might me miscalibrated.
- That won't be a problem.

46:19.828 --> 46:22.497
But Batman, you don't understand.

46:22.597 --> 46:26.101
Some of the servos are registering
at sub-optimal PSI readings.

46:26.201 --> 46:29.050
Doctor, I've seen the specs.
I can handle it.

46:44.884 --> 46:47.935
- Nice.
- Boot it up.

46:53.427 --> 46:57.011
- Forget something?
- Oh, of course.

47:04.371 --> 47:07.409
- I think that'll do.
- You ordered your own mech?

47:07.509 --> 47:09.678
You think you're the only
billionaire in the world?

47:09.778 --> 47:11.813
I convinced Langstrom
you might need some backup.

47:11.913 --> 47:15.544
The Queen Industries contract helps
support research and development.

47:15.644 --> 47:18.031
We filed a report.

47:18.919 --> 47:20.329
Let's go.

47:24.425 --> 47:26.995
- <i>Welcome, Batman.</i>
- Prepare to deploy.

47:27.295 --> 47:30.632
Copy that. Actuator systems, nominal.

47:30.732 --> 47:34.935
E systems, 100%. Weapon systems, online.

47:40.374 --> 47:42.423
Wait for me.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.318
<i>Launch in 10, nine, eight,</i>

47:50.418 --> 47:55.123
<i>seven, six, five, four,</i>

47:55.223 --> 47:58.827
<i>three, two, one.</i>

47:58.927 --> 48:00.741
Launch!

48:13.440 --> 48:15.143
This is one sweet ride.

48:15.243 --> 48:18.513
Green Arrow, you're on Chemo.
Stop the freezing process.

48:18.613 --> 48:22.534
- My pleasure.
- Langstrom, I need something else from you.

48:22.634 --> 48:24.081
You do?

48:42.036 --> 48:46.408
Masked freak, zero. Croc, everything.

48:46.508 --> 48:50.795
<i>We can now confirm the mysterious freezing
conditions falling over Gotham City</i>

48:50.895 --> 48:54.111
<i>are a result of an attack
by supervillains.</i>

48:54.998 --> 48:57.702
Come on. That was my favorite TV!

48:58.357 --> 48:59.621
Is that Batman?

48:59.721 --> 49:02.090
You know, your mouth runs faster
than your brain, speedster.

49:02.190 --> 49:04.071
Who else would that be?

49:13.901 --> 49:16.133
What's this button do?

49:24.812 --> 49:27.084
Oh, yeah!

49:34.038 --> 49:37.942
- Nothing's stopping this guy.
- I've got you, boy wonder.

49:38.042 --> 49:40.979
It's impossible to stop me in this thing.

49:41.079 --> 49:44.199
And by impossible, obviously,
I meant totally possible.

49:44.299 --> 49:46.846
Which one was it again?

49:52.706 --> 49:56.757
Had it under control the whole time.

49:59.580 --> 50:03.674
Keep Clayface from destroying the city,
Batman says. Sure, no problem.

50:03.774 --> 50:06.254
- <i>Robin, come in.</i>
- Dr. Langstrom, is that you?

50:06.354 --> 50:11.138
<i>Yes, Batman sent me.
I'm headed your way, fast... too fast.</i>

50:21.069 --> 50:24.005
This vehicle travels far too fast.

50:24.105 --> 50:26.725
Yeah, it's awesome. What have you got?

50:26.825 --> 50:29.327
Batman has a plan for dealing
with the lava creature,

50:29.477 --> 50:32.559
but it's only at the design stage.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.656
Hey, Chemo.

50:42.056 --> 50:46.411
The kids of Gotham are happy to build
snow-forts and have snowball fights in summer.

50:46.511 --> 50:48.292
But enough is enough.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.254
Hello, I'm talking to you.

51:15.088 --> 51:18.038
Okay, now you're just hurting my feelings.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.870
Let's try that again.

52:14.481 --> 52:18.119
Which building you want, Buzz?
You can have your pick.

52:18.219 --> 52:19.988
Who's there?

52:20.488 --> 52:25.266
Mr. Cobblepot, you're back.
We haven't seen you for some time.

52:25.376 --> 52:29.214
You're going to be seeing a lot
of me now. Care to know why?

52:29.314 --> 52:32.964
Because Gotham belongs to me now.

52:35.036 --> 52:38.452
And not even Batman
can do anything about it.

52:40.775 --> 52:44.612
Oh, yes, meet my right-hand penguin, Buzz.

52:44.712 --> 52:46.968
I'm naming him head of security.

52:48.131 --> 52:51.365
Nice to meet you, boss.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.227
Yeah, I think it's time to retire.

53:04.448 --> 53:08.766
It will be the most powerful laser
cannon ever constructed. In theory.

53:08.866 --> 53:11.852
Don't worry, I'm sure
we can get this thing going.

53:18.111 --> 53:20.627
This should pull in enough amps.

53:22.649 --> 53:24.452
Okay, that's most of the stuff.

53:24.552 --> 53:26.988
What took so long? You've been gone
for, like, two full minutes.

53:27.088 --> 53:29.824
Some of the things on the list
were only available in Central City.

53:29.924 --> 53:33.662
- Excuses. Excuses.
- Here, I'll go get the rest of it.

53:34.162 --> 53:37.999
So, Dr. Langstrom, this Cannon will be
powerful enough to cut Clayface down to size?

53:38.099 --> 53:42.721
- Batman hopes so.
- Great! Wait, "hopes"? He doesn't know?

53:42.821 --> 53:46.507
Well, the last time a giant lava monster
attacked Gotham was, never.

53:46.607 --> 53:50.457
So, no, we haven't had a lot
of chances to test it out.

53:51.761 --> 53:56.618
You think some robot's going to stop me?
Just one of your toys.

53:57.118 --> 53:59.532
Here's another one.

54:11.848 --> 54:15.412
I'll break your machine, Batman.

54:45.732 --> 54:50.138
I'm going to pry open
that shell of yours, Batman,

54:50.238 --> 54:54.221
so I can get to the soft center.

55:42.322 --> 55:45.793
Thank you for doing
my dirty work, detective.

55:45.893 --> 55:48.496
With Killer Croc out of the way,

55:48.596 --> 55:53.013
I'll be able to enjoy
my dominion over Gotham.

55:57.370 --> 56:00.441
You plan to dominate Gotham
as the Penguin's flunky?

56:00.541 --> 56:03.694
The Penguin is a means to an end.

56:03.794 --> 56:07.044
Looks to me like he's sitting back
and watching you do all the work.

56:11.551 --> 56:15.957
Tell me, Batman, between Penguin and me,

56:16.057 --> 56:19.440
who is the bigger man?

56:21.494 --> 56:24.875
Don't forget what they say.
The bigger they are...

56:41.583 --> 56:45.099
This day at the beach is turning out
to be no day at the beach.

56:55.178 --> 56:57.415
Computer, are all
of these buildings evacuated?

56:57.565 --> 57:00.435
<i>Affirmative. No life signs detected.</i>

57:00.535 --> 57:04.188
- Show me which ones I own.
- <i>Displaying now.</i>

57:04.288 --> 57:07.170
Good, 'cause I have great insurance.

57:13.413 --> 57:16.597
That one needed a renovation anyway. Yeah.

57:18.718 --> 57:20.071
You're sure it's ready to be tested?

57:20.171 --> 57:23.220
We don't have time
to work up a better prototype.

57:28.328 --> 57:30.576
That's a good sign.

57:33.301 --> 57:37.772
- And that's a bad sign.
- Batman's not going to be happy.

57:37.872 --> 57:41.821
The contrivance
wouldn't have worked anyway.

57:45.845 --> 57:50.384
- What did you do to it?
- Nothing. The design was flawed.

57:50.484 --> 57:54.639
It couldn't support valence co-sharing
between the bonded particles.

57:55.189 --> 58:00.061
He's right. Should have thought of that.
No one tell Batman, okay?

58:00.161 --> 58:03.564
Why are you here? We know it was you
who put Gotham in a deep freeze.

58:03.664 --> 58:06.350
It was, but I was foolish.

58:06.450 --> 58:10.188
- You're here to turn yourself in?
- No, I'm here to help.

58:10.288 --> 58:13.991
As if. We're not getting fooled
by that old trick. Are we?

58:14.091 --> 58:16.160
Why would you want to help us
clean up your mess?

58:16.260 --> 58:18.863
Because it is my mess.

58:18.963 --> 58:22.366
All I wanted was to be left alone
in my desolate land

58:22.466 --> 58:25.436
but Penguin convinced me
to assault Gotham.

58:25.536 --> 58:29.457
I was manipulated and then betrayed.

58:29.557 --> 58:31.717
- I'll admit, that makes sense.
- Really?

58:31.817 --> 58:34.812
'Cause all I'm hearing is, "I'm a bad guy.
I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy."

58:34.912 --> 58:36.894
You said something about helping.

58:37.981 --> 58:41.586
- Nice and slow.
- This is one of my arctic devices.

58:41.686 --> 58:46.257
Coupled with your Cannon, it could be
an effective weapon against Clayface.

58:46.357 --> 58:49.360
But what is... Oh, I see. Brilliant.

58:49.460 --> 58:52.613
He's right, it could work.
But he'd have to help us set it up.

58:52.713 --> 58:56.324
- Then the question is, can we trust him?
- No.

58:59.836 --> 59:01.372
Maybe.

59:01.672 --> 59:04.094
I better call the boss on this one.

59:06.444 --> 59:08.979
Your mech has a back.

59:09.079 --> 59:11.628
I bet I can break it.

59:17.187 --> 59:20.658
<i>Langstrom's laser's a bust, but Mr. Freeze
is here and says he can get it to work.</i>

59:20.758 --> 59:22.573
- Do it.
- <i>You think you can trust him?</i>

59:29.416 --> 59:32.654
- Imagine being partners with the Penguin.
- <i>I'd rather not.</i>

59:32.754 --> 59:35.273
Working with the Penguin
is an easy thing to regret.

59:35.373 --> 59:37.775
Victor's whole personality
is built on guilt.

59:37.875 --> 59:40.444
He's got enough of a conscience
to want to make amends.

59:40.544 --> 59:43.005
<i>Got it. Robin out.</i>

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:55.165
Well, well, well.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.340
Who knew that's all it would take?

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:21.123
Oh, no.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.709
Me and my big external speaker.

01:01:48.855 --> 01:01:52.138
Anyone ever tell you
your power is kind of gross?

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.876
Fine. How about call it a draw?

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.080
Done yet? How about now? Now?

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.535
The Flash pestering me does not
encourage my success.

01:02:34.635 --> 01:02:36.320
So we do have something in common.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.789
Yeah, but Flash is right.
You need to be done.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:42.635
- Done in one more minute.
- Not sure you've got it.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.691
Or we can be done now. Now's fine.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.353
Fire!

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:14.304
It worked briefly,
but we need a sustained blast.

01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:32.989
Without his freeze suit,
these temperatures could kill him.

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:37.681
Dr. Freeze, let me operate the cannon.
Get away from the lava.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.864
Only I can manage the arctic device.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:55.711
How much more can he take?

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.484
Your freeze suit, where is it?

01:04:13.584 --> 01:04:17.267
I just wanted solitude.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:26.742
<i>Watch out for the acid thing!
He loves to do the acid thing.</i>

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:43.259
<i>What's happening? Hey!</i>

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.212
Hey! I think I need that.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.642
You cracked him?
No one's ever cracked him.

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:46.756
- <i>I like what I'm hearing.</i>
- Green Arrow, I'm trying to concentrate.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:51.160
Oh, sorry. Let's see if I can help.

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:35.254
I think we got him.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:02.098
<i>Can I talk now? Did we win?</i>

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:13.063
Mayor Cobblepot. No, Governor Cobblepot.

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.666
No, no, President Cobblepot.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.368
No, no, Lord Cobblepot!

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:21.014
That has a nice ring to it.

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.290
What?

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:37.621
Melting?
This isn't supposed to be melting.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:41.704
Where are my monsters?
What are they doing?

01:07:42.815 --> 01:07:45.174
Here comes one now.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.613
What?

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:02.395
We've stopped them all, Penguin.
It's over.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.782
No. No. No!

01:08:04.882 --> 01:08:07.400
Curse you, Batman. No.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.302
Hey! You should've seen the look on you face
when we came around the corner. Priceless.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:31.886
They'll be fine, once they wake up
back inside a cell in Arkham Asylum.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.212
Almost there.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:38.728
So very hot.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.203
I found it.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.975
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

01:08:48.075 --> 01:08:49.408
What's gonna happen to him?

01:08:49.509 --> 01:08:52.996
He'll get a trial, and I imagine
he'll be back at Arkham with the others.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:57.484
- He saved us.
- Yes, but I caused all this as well.

01:08:57.584 --> 01:09:01.788
It's all right. Perhaps I can request
solitary confinement.

01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:05.091
I might find the peace
I've been looking for.

01:09:05.191 --> 01:09:06.894
One more.

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:10.214
You may have beaten me this time,
but once I'm free...

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.045
Enough!

01:09:12.145 --> 01:09:15.069
I'll have the last laugh over all of you.

01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:17.504
Don't forget his pet.

01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:21.237
All right, calm down now.
What's gotten into this thing?

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:31.484
Remember that hole you guy's
blew out on our floor? Good news.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:35.122
During labor detail,
you can help with the reconstruction.

01:09:35.221 --> 01:09:37.270
Fantastic!

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.545
Well, well, well.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:46.500
When I vowed to get even,
I had no idea it would be this soon.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.702
What are you going to do to me, clown?

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:52.435
You're in that cell, and I'm in this one.

01:09:57.676 --> 01:09:59.085
You were saying?

01:10:04.775 --> 01:10:07.116
Not the beak!

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.398
Look, Daddy!

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.431
I'll have to replace
the forward actuators.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:37.425
Clearly, new struts along the port side.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.185
I can fix this.

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:53.662
Oh, no! What did he do to you?

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.987
I heard you let the new kid
drive the Batmobile.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:11:00.958
- Yes.
- I didn't get to do that for years.

01:11:01.058 --> 01:11:03.775
The northern lights are supposed to be great
in Finland, but they start in 20 seconds,

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:07.731
so, I have to leave soon.
Great working with you again, buddy.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.962
I'm not your buddy.

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:15.317
What a kidder!

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:24.064
There's a Queen Industries building down by
the harbor that needs some reconstruction.

01:11:24.164 --> 01:11:26.745
See you when I see you, Bats.

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:33.090
Batman, I know I haven't been
the new Robin for very long,

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:37.273
but thank you for taking me out
on this mission. I learned a lot.

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:45.203
Robin, I owe you. The whole city owes you.

01:11:46.003 --> 01:11:48.939
We couldn't have done it
without your help today.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:52.042
Thanks. That means a lot.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:55.112
Hey, I was going to go train.
Want to come?

01:11:55.212 --> 01:11:58.608
You can help me learn how to do those
quick getaways you're always pulling.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:04.654
Okay, let's go.
Alfred, you're on watch duty.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.969
Of course, sir.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:12.329
Have you really been to a whole
planetwide amusement park?

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.210
- Yes.
- How was it?

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.378
Enjoyable.
