00:37.004 --> 00:37.921
Don't stop!

00:39.087 --> 00:39.920
Come on!

00:41.254 --> 00:42.104
Trying to escape?

00:47.545 --> 00:48.378
There it is!

00:48.462 --> 00:49.296
Gotcha!

00:50.337 --> 00:51.837
How about that, mutt?

00:53.546 --> 00:55.087
Don't wanna play with us, eh?

00:56.462 --> 00:57.337
Mutt…

00:58.004 --> 01:00.054
Dudes, I'm going for a three-pointer now!

01:06.296 --> 01:07.796
Leave the dog alone!

01:13.546 --> 01:14.712
Hey you, sucker!

01:14.796 --> 01:16.170
Looking for trouble?

01:16.254 --> 01:17.087
Sucker…

01:19.087 --> 01:20.837
You just leave the dog alone!

01:21.379 --> 01:23.004
He asked for it.

01:30.087 --> 01:32.629
Twenty years later

01:50.004 --> 01:52.087
Holy shit!

01:52.171 --> 01:53.921
Seal the bags! Now!

01:58.587 --> 01:59.920
Put it back!

02:00.004 --> 02:01.962
-Hey you, be careful!
-Money, money…

02:06.462 --> 02:07.504
Who the hell is he?!

02:11.837 --> 02:13.987
Shut the door on him
before we go bankrupt!

02:16.796 --> 02:17.712
Step on it!

02:19.171 --> 02:20.462
See you later, alligator!

02:25.546 --> 02:26.396
You can't get us!

02:39.754 --> 02:41.671
Stuff it back in, you clumsy moron!

02:45.421 --> 02:47.587
Amigo! We have a problem.

02:49.004 --> 02:50.378
Give me a second. I'll handle it.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.087
-Break through it.
-What?

02:52.171 --> 02:54.212
-Break through it!
-I'm on it!

03:07.337 --> 03:08.546
Get back to work!

03:09.087 --> 03:09.920
Go!

03:17.629 --> 03:19.212
Go, go!

03:27.087 --> 03:29.087
Can you break a 5000 note for me, pals?

03:34.712 --> 03:35.587
Igor Grom was

03:37.129 --> 03:38.629
a true hero.

03:39.796 --> 03:42.879
He was a role model for all of us.

03:44.712 --> 03:47.462
He was a great man.

03:50.212 --> 03:51.212
We are going

03:53.212 --> 03:54.462
to miss him.

04:06.087 --> 04:07.129
Think.

04:36.254 --> 04:37.296
You've got balls.

04:38.504 --> 04:39.629
Think!

04:45.212 --> 04:46.296
He's on the roof!

04:57.504 --> 04:58.462
Lose him!

05:02.296 --> 05:03.129
Pull over!

05:04.504 --> 05:05.337
What?

05:16.879 --> 05:17.921
I filmed everything.

05:27.087 --> 05:28.337
Igor!

05:28.421 --> 05:30.671
Hop in! We got it covered!

05:31.504 --> 05:33.087
I'll do it. Give me some water.

05:33.962 --> 05:35.421
Igor, are you okay?

05:40.296 --> 05:41.296
Holy shit.

05:42.837 --> 05:43.795
Igor!

05:43.879 --> 05:45.212
Central, do you copy me?

05:47.962 --> 05:49.504
Amigo! Cops!

05:50.337 --> 05:51.637
What do you want me to do?

05:53.879 --> 05:54.962
Ready!

05:56.171 --> 05:57.379
Maintain your positions!

05:58.837 --> 05:59.671
Step on it.

06:01.712 --> 06:02.546
Fire!

06:22.296 --> 06:24.170
On this special day

06:24.254 --> 06:26.129
I am happy to announce

06:26.629 --> 06:28.337
that the streets of our city are

06:28.421 --> 06:30.171
quiet and safe now.

06:30.837 --> 06:31.670
My colleague here

06:31.754 --> 06:32.962
can confirm it.

06:33.962 --> 06:35.754
The crime rate has hit

06:36.462 --> 06:38.112
-the lowest…
-Run for your life!

06:40.837 --> 06:41.670
Clear the way!

06:52.421 --> 06:54.171
Fyodor Ivanovich.

06:55.462 --> 06:56.462
Igor…

07:38.754 --> 07:39.804
Who the hell are you?

07:43.462 --> 07:46.253
MAJOR GROM

07:46.337 --> 07:47.504

Hey, Oobie Doobie! Welcome to the Police
Directorate of Saint-Petersburg!

11:09.129 --> 11:10.004
My name is Dubin.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.837
You'd better have a sense of humor here.
Let's go.

11:12.921 --> 11:15.253
A police officer will be assigned
to mentor you.

11:15.337 --> 11:17.170
You'll receive a trainee's kit

11:17.254 --> 11:20.212
with your uniform, a taser and a torch
to help you always find your way.

11:20.296 --> 11:21.420
I'm sorry.

11:21.504 --> 11:22.837
Boss.

11:22.921 --> 11:25.821
You don't go to jail for domestic violence
in this country.

11:26.587 --> 11:28.295
But you beat your neighbor.

11:28.379 --> 11:30.337
He's like a brother to me, I swear.

11:30.421 --> 11:32.462
Okay, will you sign the confession?

11:32.546 --> 11:35.712
Do you want to read the Constitution
of the Russian Federation with me?

11:35.796 --> 11:36.920
Sonny…

11:37.004 --> 11:39.712
Sonny, when I turned back,
my wallet was already gone.

11:41.212 --> 11:44.296
Pops, your wallet is this small.
And the city is this big.

11:44.962 --> 11:46.462
You think I can find it?

11:46.546 --> 11:48.546
You're slow as a snail. Come on!

11:53.004 --> 11:54.420
Welcome to our treasure room.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.629
Hey, Mikhalych.

11:56.296 --> 11:58.587
We store items of evidence here.

11:58.671 --> 12:01.254
The clowns had these guns
when we got them.

12:04.546 --> 12:05.504
Wanna shoot it?

12:06.754 --> 12:07.628
Go ahead!

12:07.712 --> 12:08.629
Are you an idiot?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.412
Never ever touch anything in this room!

12:12.796 --> 12:14.337
You just let me…

12:14.421 --> 12:16.504
That was a joke. Irony, you know?

12:17.879 --> 12:19.503
We have two detention centers here.

12:19.587 --> 12:22.753
Real badass guys go
to solitary confinement cells.

12:22.837 --> 12:25.753
Other lowlifes enjoy the general
population detention center.

12:25.837 --> 12:27.437
FC Zenit is the champion, right?

12:29.212 --> 12:30.412
Let us in, Gennadyevich.

12:32.212 --> 12:33.046
Come on in.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.878
Look at the scumbags in there.

12:35.962 --> 12:36.878
You shouldn't say that.

12:36.962 --> 12:40.503
Statistically every fifth person
in detention centers got there

12:40.587 --> 12:41.712
by mistake.

12:41.796 --> 12:44.129
Me! They got me by mistake!

12:46.171 --> 12:47.046
Moron.

12:48.296 --> 12:50.129
-You're the moron here.
-What's that?

12:51.254 --> 12:52.753
You're the moron here!

12:52.837 --> 12:54.796
Amigo!

12:55.337 --> 12:56.537
Another day in the life.

12:57.796 --> 12:58.837
You know, kiddo.

12:59.629 --> 13:01.670
You have to be special to do this job.

13:01.754 --> 13:04.378
Many people give up
and quit it as soon as they can.

13:04.462 --> 13:06.462
Those who stay fall into two categories:

13:07.671 --> 13:09.212
pussies and hounds.

13:10.171 --> 13:13.420
Pussies always save their asses,
passing the buck

13:13.504 --> 13:15.295
and blaming others.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.045
Pops.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.837
It wasn't me who stole your wallet.

13:18.921 --> 13:20.629
Sonny, you don't get it.

13:21.254 --> 13:23.462
I kept all my pension money there.

13:23.546 --> 13:24.671
And the hounds…

13:25.379 --> 13:28.879
They'll do anything to make sure
justice is served in this city.

13:29.712 --> 13:31.628
We pick up the scent of a bad guy

13:31.712 --> 13:34.462
and never stop
until he gets what he deserves.

13:38.129 --> 13:39.579
That was another joke, right?

13:41.171 --> 13:42.546
Tzvetkov, attention!

13:48.296 --> 13:49.296
I wanna see Grom.

13:55.962 --> 13:57.546
Prokopenko is here.

14:04.337 --> 14:05.629
I wanna see Grom!

14:13.754 --> 14:15.171
You'd better sleep at home.

14:16.879 --> 14:17.712
Get up.

14:18.296 --> 14:19.796
Prokopenko is calling for you.

14:30.879 --> 14:32.379
Hey, is he a cop?

14:33.254 --> 14:34.804
Where did he find a dump truck?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.378
That's gonna be fun.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.253
Hey there. Are you a part-time
dump truck driver now?

14:43.337 --> 14:44.296
Hey man.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.421
Let's do it!

15:18.254 --> 15:19.129
What's going on?

15:20.379 --> 15:22.378
They bet on Grom's dismissal.

15:22.462 --> 15:23.662
That's a tradition here.

15:24.671 --> 15:26.128
…destroyed 200 meters of pavement…

15:26.212 --> 15:27.379
Fyodor Ivanovich.

15:31.046 --> 15:31.962
Sit down.

15:33.171 --> 15:34.921
Tell me. What were you doing there?

15:35.421 --> 15:36.753
Today is your day off.

15:36.837 --> 15:38.670
Why did you go after them alone?

15:38.754 --> 15:41.046
-Who cares? I did it.
-You did it?

15:42.462 --> 15:44.004
You created havoc out there.

15:44.921 --> 15:46.420
The street repairs will cost ten mio.

15:46.504 --> 15:48.879
They do it every year anyway.

15:50.837 --> 15:52.337
Spending taxpayers' money.

15:53.129 --> 15:53.962
Really?

15:54.046 --> 15:54.921
Yeah.

15:57.212 --> 16:00.412
You know that you put the entire
department under fire? Everyone!

16:02.587 --> 16:03.837
This time he's done.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.545
I covered all the bases.

16:05.629 --> 16:08.837
You think you're a utility player
or what?! He covered all the bases.

16:08.921 --> 16:10.337
Or are you a superhero?

16:10.421 --> 16:11.254
Are you?

16:11.754 --> 16:14.087
I'm sick and tired of your tricks!

16:16.296 --> 16:17.712
You carry no body cameras!

16:17.796 --> 16:19.420
You violate service regulations!

16:19.504 --> 16:21.628
You don't even think
about the consequences!

16:21.712 --> 16:23.546
I can't get it. What do you want?

16:24.087 --> 16:26.128
You wanna prove
that you're the toughest cookie?

16:26.212 --> 16:27.462
Am I not?

16:28.421 --> 16:31.879
I accomplish more
than the rest of the directorate.

16:33.796 --> 16:37.212
Why the hell are you doing it? Why?

16:37.296 --> 16:39.462
We have to work as a team.

16:39.546 --> 16:42.254
But all you can do is
stick your head out there.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.296
And I have to cover your ass.

16:49.004 --> 16:51.587
But this is exactly what you want, right?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.254
The clearance rate would go
down the toilet without me.

16:57.087 --> 16:58.629
Leave the service!

16:59.129 --> 17:00.429
And then we'll see! Do it!

17:01.671 --> 17:03.712
Here you are! Write a dismissal letter!

17:08.712 --> 17:11.087
'Please be advised
that I voluntarily resign my employment

17:11.171 --> 17:12.837
in the law enforcement community.

17:12.921 --> 17:17.004
Please degrade me too.'

17:18.712 --> 17:20.129
Keep writing!

17:22.254 --> 17:23.604
The date and the signature.

18:17.587 --> 18:18.879
Here you go, Pops.

18:28.296 --> 18:29.462
I mean…

18:29.546 --> 18:32.795
I threw in 100 rubles.
That's the least we can do for you.

18:32.879 --> 18:33.921
Happy to serve you.

18:39.087 --> 18:40.287
News with Anna Terebkina

18:45.087 --> 18:47.921
Hello. I am Anna Terebkina.
And here is today's top news.

18:48.421 --> 18:51.087
The Rosgarantbank employees
had barely recovered

18:51.171 --> 18:52.628
after the robbery of the head office

18:52.712 --> 18:55.045
when they got under siege again.

18:55.129 --> 18:57.878
The cheated investors and clients want
their money back.

18:57.962 --> 19:01.962
Olga Isayeva who owns the bank declined
to comment on the situation.

19:02.046 --> 19:03.462
In other news.

19:03.546 --> 19:06.837
Today is the last day of the lawsuit
against Kirill Grechkin,

19:06.921 --> 19:08.920
a son of the well-known billionaire.

19:09.004 --> 19:12.253
He has been charged
with a first degree homicide by vehicle.

19:12.337 --> 19:15.712
In April this year Kirill's car hit

19:15.796 --> 19:18.504
Liza Makarova
from the local children's home.

19:21.387 --> 19:24.179
That was the day of our field trip.

19:26.179 --> 19:28.304
We came here to see the bascule bridges.

19:31.262 --> 19:33.345
But first I took Liza to a coffee shop

19:33.429 --> 19:34.529
to buy some ice cream.

19:35.054 --> 19:37.354
-Look who's there.
-We stepped out of the shop,

19:39.637 --> 19:42.553
-and this moron came out of nowhere.
-Objection! Verbal abuse!

19:42.637 --> 19:44.512
Please, watch your tongue.

19:48.304 --> 19:51.345
Grechkin came out of nowhere. Hammered.

19:51.429 --> 19:54.053
Objection! No evidence
of driving under the influence!

19:54.137 --> 19:55.887
-Sustained.
-He bribed them.

19:55.971 --> 19:57.179
Order!

20:01.012 --> 20:02.054
You may continue.

20:07.762 --> 20:08.637
Your Honor.

20:10.762 --> 20:11.846
Liza is…

20:13.471 --> 20:14.571
She is my only family.

20:18.596 --> 20:19.429
She was…

20:21.554 --> 20:22.512
Okay, got it.

20:26.471 --> 20:30.012
If there is any justice in the world,

20:32.346 --> 20:33.996
Kirill Grechkin must be punished.

20:47.512 --> 20:51.428
Kirill! What do you think
about the court ruling?

20:51.512 --> 20:54.345
Courts in this country are well-known
for their compassion.

20:54.429 --> 20:56.303
Kirill, what are you going to do next?

20:56.387 --> 20:58.887
Don't know.
Will go on a vacation or something.

20:58.971 --> 21:00.137
Wanna go with me?

21:00.679 --> 21:04.095
But first, I am going to file a complaint
against the municipal police.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.845
Major Grom used excessive brutal force
when he arrested me.

21:06.929 --> 21:08.554
My arms are still bruised.

21:09.096 --> 21:10.303
Look at them.

21:10.387 --> 21:12.303
That's what I call police lawlessness.

21:12.387 --> 21:14.970
Chill out.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.512
Wanna go to jail instead of him?

21:16.596 --> 21:18.553
I don't give a shit!
I'll never let this matter rest!

21:18.637 --> 21:20.037
What else do you wanna know?

21:23.846 --> 21:24.887
Let it go.

21:30.137 --> 21:31.012
Igor.

21:31.512 --> 21:32.387
Hello.

21:32.929 --> 21:33.762
Hello.

21:33.846 --> 21:35.845
I'm Tatyana Mikhailovna,
Lyosha's teacher.

21:35.929 --> 21:37.879
-Nice to meet you.
-Please, forgive him.

21:38.429 --> 21:40.179
-He is grieving.
-I know.

21:41.929 --> 21:44.387
-Please, call me if anything.
-Thank you.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.137
Sorry, could you

21:46.762 --> 21:49.462
write it down? Or take a picture?
This is my only card.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.053
Sure.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.512
Thank you! Everyone's free to go now.

21:53.596 --> 21:55.137
Including me.

23:33.221 --> 23:35.054
PROKOPENKO: Will you pop by?

23:39.304 --> 23:41.137
Forget about obsolete messengers, websites

23:41.221 --> 23:42.512
and video streaming systems.

23:42.596 --> 23:46.762
Welcome to the first ever AI social media
platform called Vmeste (Together).

23:47.471 --> 23:50.053
You received envelopes
with your personal AR glasses.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.720
You'll find a button on the temple.

23:51.804 --> 23:53.595
Press it to activate the glasses.

23:53.679 --> 23:55.346
Can you see me now?

23:56.012 --> 23:57.845
My name is Margo.

23:57.929 --> 23:59.970
I'm your virtual personal assistant.

24:00.054 --> 24:03.678
Over the last five years Vmeste has become
a top social network…

24:03.762 --> 24:05.512
What happens if they don't like it?

24:09.054 --> 24:12.012
Seryozha, this is your lifetime project.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.562
It will cause a paradigm shift.

24:18.012 --> 24:19.512
-What if…
-No ifs.

24:21.221 --> 24:22.387
Go knock 'em dead.

24:24.262 --> 24:26.762
Please welcome.

24:26.846 --> 24:27.845
I believe in you.

24:27.929 --> 24:30.220
Head of the Vmeste Charity Foundation,

24:30.304 --> 24:32.137
an IT guru and a philanthropist.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.929
Please welcome Sergey Razumovskiy.

24:43.929 --> 24:45.762
The update we developed

24:46.304 --> 24:47.304
will amaze you.

24:48.137 --> 24:50.237
A picture is
worth a thousand words, right?

24:50.887 --> 24:52.846
Margo, start the presentation.

24:54.971 --> 24:58.678
Vmeste 2.0 is not just a regular update.

24:58.762 --> 25:00.178
It's a symbol.

25:00.262 --> 25:02.512
A symbol of the new
and free Russian Internet.

25:02.596 --> 25:06.053
From now on, your personal data will go
through one-way encryption.

25:06.137 --> 25:07.762
Which means that no one,

25:07.846 --> 25:10.596
absolutely no one will be able

25:11.387 --> 25:13.429
-to access it.
-Even you?

25:14.012 --> 25:14.971
Even me.

25:16.304 --> 25:17.970
You will also

25:18.054 --> 25:20.595
keep your anonymity
while accessing any website.

25:20.679 --> 25:23.345
Even those blocked under a court order.

25:23.429 --> 25:24.637
But most importantly,

25:25.387 --> 25:27.054
we grant our customers

25:27.596 --> 25:29.679
unlimited access to various content.

25:30.679 --> 25:33.595
You can read books and articles,
listen to music,

25:33.679 --> 25:36.845
and watch movies. The content is free

25:36.929 --> 25:39.012
and perfectly legal.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.096
Study and self-education

25:41.887 --> 25:45.387
will help us change our lives
for the better together.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.554
Did they release Grechkin? Really?!

26:05.346 --> 26:06.179
I'm sorry.

26:09.929 --> 26:11.720
Sergey. You were the star.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.137
-Just a reminder. In 15 minutes…
-Cancel all the meetings.

26:14.221 --> 26:15.762
Or reschedule them. I don't know…

26:15.846 --> 26:17.429
-I'm unavailable.
-I'm on it.

26:18.387 --> 26:19.637
Sergey!

26:46.596 --> 26:47.696
Oleg, that's bullshit!

26:48.346 --> 26:49.512
Apparently,

26:50.221 --> 26:51.970
these people are above the law.

26:52.054 --> 26:55.554
They can steal, rape or kill
and get away with it!

26:56.137 --> 26:58.262
I try my best…

26:58.346 --> 27:00.637
…to make people's lives better. But now…

27:02.221 --> 27:04.054
It makes no sense now.

27:06.721 --> 27:08.762
This girl and her brother…

27:09.304 --> 27:11.354
They came from our children's home, Oleg.

27:12.179 --> 27:16.095
How many more humans will be killed
or injured because of Grechkin and alike?

27:16.179 --> 27:17.829
Who'll protect people from them?!

27:21.429 --> 27:23.137
There's nothing I can do.

27:26.137 --> 27:27.137
It's an atrocity.

27:29.012 --> 27:30.412
And it's gonna happen again.

27:32.304 --> 27:33.512
No way.

27:41.221 --> 27:42.304
I promise you.

27:58.804 --> 28:01.220
What can we do, Igor?
Rich kids like Grechkin

28:01.304 --> 28:03.679
always get away with it.

28:04.221 --> 28:05.678
Good job.

28:05.762 --> 28:07.846
Thankies.

28:09.471 --> 28:10.929
You know, I remember,

28:11.762 --> 28:13.137
when we worked with your dad,

28:13.221 --> 28:15.345
we often had parties like Grechkin.

28:15.429 --> 28:17.970
But like they say, sooner or later

28:18.054 --> 28:19.762
-these motherf…
-Fyodor!

28:21.346 --> 28:22.887
I say, these pricks will get

28:23.721 --> 28:24.970
what they deserve.

28:25.054 --> 28:26.303
I know what I'm talking about.

28:26.387 --> 28:28.554
Passing verdicts is not our job.

28:29.096 --> 28:31.387
We search and nail bad guys.

28:31.929 --> 28:33.345
And let justice be served.

28:33.429 --> 28:35.137
There's no justice.

28:35.637 --> 28:36.929
The system is rotten.

28:38.054 --> 28:39.553
-To the core.
-Igor…

28:39.637 --> 28:42.137
You work like a dog, you risk your life.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.470
-Keep it quiet.
-You dig up evidence against bastards.

28:44.554 --> 28:46.387
But the court lets them go. Is that okay?

28:46.471 --> 28:47.304
Quiet.

28:47.804 --> 28:48.928
We can't break the law.

28:49.012 --> 28:50.679
There's no other way.

28:51.346 --> 28:52.346
What do you suggest?

28:54.262 --> 28:55.212
Boiling them alive?

28:56.637 --> 28:57.471
Or frying them?

28:59.554 --> 29:00.387
Here you are, Igor.

29:00.471 --> 29:01.346
I mended it.

29:03.304 --> 29:04.429
Thanks, Auntie Lena.

29:05.054 --> 29:06.929
Lucky you, Igor.

29:07.596 --> 29:08.470
-Take it easy.
-Why?

29:08.554 --> 29:10.137
-It's no big deal.
-No big deal.

29:10.221 --> 29:12.271
I don't mean that. You have a girlfriend?

29:12.762 --> 29:14.803
-Fyodor…
-He is working all the time.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.179
That's his life.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.396
Excuse me. It's a work-related call.

29:30.471 --> 29:32.804
What did I tell you? Work again.

29:34.679 --> 29:37.178
You were exactly the same
when you were young.

29:37.262 --> 29:40.137
You had nothing in your life
except work and your bike.

29:40.221 --> 29:41.762
-Hello.
-Hello. Igor?

29:42.887 --> 29:45.845
Tatyana Mikhailovna speaking.
You said I can call you.

29:45.929 --> 29:47.262
Sure. What happened?

29:47.346 --> 29:49.512
I am really worried about Lyosha.
He disappeared.

29:49.596 --> 29:51.553
He didn't have dinner.
He doesn't pick up the phone.

29:51.637 --> 29:53.721
I am afraid he can do something stupid.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.679
That was a nice try.

30:17.637 --> 30:19.471
But karma is a bitch.

30:19.971 --> 30:21.679
What do you want?!

30:23.262 --> 30:24.387
I want justice.

30:25.554 --> 30:26.387
No!

30:26.471 --> 30:28.429
That's a bad dream. It's not real.

31:09.512 --> 31:10.971
Think!

31:25.971 --> 31:27.054
Perfect.

31:40.846 --> 31:41.887
No way.

31:45.054 --> 31:47.304
Freeze! Police!

32:12.096 --> 32:12.929
Okay, Kostya.

32:13.471 --> 32:14.971
I think we've got a match.

32:15.512 --> 32:18.178
Well, Igor, the guy was a suspect.

32:18.262 --> 32:19.637
He is a dangerous offender.

32:19.721 --> 32:22.095
He matches your description. Is that him?

32:22.179 --> 32:24.221
I've never seen parties like him.

32:25.221 --> 32:27.095
His reaction was lightning-fast.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.221
He had an armor and flamethrowers.

32:32.471 --> 32:33.887
That's the man, right?

32:33.971 --> 32:34.928
Oh yes.

32:35.012 --> 32:37.762
One little hitch. He's a guy
from a fairy tale and he's immortal.

32:37.846 --> 32:38.970
Why is he so gloomy today?

32:39.054 --> 32:42.178
I'm gonna go to the evidence room
to break his life-protecting spell.

32:42.262 --> 32:43.928
We'll find the egg with the needle inside.

32:44.012 --> 32:45.387
We'll seal his swamp.

32:45.471 --> 32:47.571
And we'll drag his cat in for questioning.

32:50.137 --> 32:52.137
All the cases solved?

32:53.304 --> 32:55.221
Go to your workstations.

32:59.387 --> 33:02.220
We've got a suspect. That's your Lyosha.

33:02.304 --> 33:05.179
Arrested in the vicinity
of the Grechkins' mansion.

33:05.804 --> 33:06.762
Where is he now?

33:07.387 --> 33:08.687
In the interrogation room.

33:15.054 --> 33:16.804
Don't leave your stuff unattended.

33:18.762 --> 33:20.428
Did the forensic experts find anything?

33:20.512 --> 33:22.928
Nada. Neither evidence nor fingerprints.

33:23.012 --> 33:24.554
Something new, right?

33:27.554 --> 33:29.220
-Where are you going?
-Excuse me.

33:29.304 --> 33:31.703
My name is Dima Dubin. I'm a trainee here.

33:31.787 --> 33:33.838
I made a sketch based
on your description.

33:33.922 --> 33:34.755
Let him in.

33:35.762 --> 33:37.512
-Let me see it.
-You have big ears, right?

33:37.596 --> 33:39.304
I heard your talk.

33:40.387 --> 33:41.554
Here you are.

33:43.012 --> 33:44.262
Okay.

33:50.346 --> 33:52.471
Do you need help? I'm ready.

33:53.929 --> 33:55.304
Too early for that. Got it?

33:56.512 --> 33:58.637
-Can you draw me?
-I can.

33:58.721 --> 34:00.137
Now, kiddo.

34:00.221 --> 34:02.637
I know you didn't kill him.
I wanna help you.

34:04.804 --> 34:06.012
Somebody else helped me

34:07.096 --> 34:08.428
when he killed that moron.

34:08.512 --> 34:09.862
You know anything about it?

34:11.804 --> 34:12.637
Yep.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.054
The man who did it is a real hero.

34:25.054 --> 34:26.887
Igor. The kid doesn't have an alibi,

34:26.971 --> 34:29.421
but he's got a motive.
Can we close the case file?

34:30.221 --> 34:31.721
You'd better close your mouth.

34:32.429 --> 34:33.803
A silent fool is counted wise.

34:33.887 --> 34:35.262
You wanna eat a pie or not?

34:51.387 --> 34:52.345
How to build a flamethrower

34:52.429 --> 34:53.554
Search

35:04.762 --> 35:07.512
…a fancy costume
with a bone mask of a bird's skull…

35:08.721 --> 35:09.554
Birds

35:17.471 --> 35:19.671
Hello. Were you
Kirill Grechkin's schoolmate?

35:20.512 --> 35:21.679
I wish he were dead.

35:22.304 --> 35:23.304
He is now.

35:46.762 --> 35:48.470
-I'll pay you the rest later.
-No worries. It's okay.

35:48.554 --> 35:50.012
…yet another controversy.

35:50.096 --> 35:52.137
Clouds of noxious fumes…

35:52.221 --> 35:54.179
Will you stop feeding the mutt?

35:54.679 --> 35:56.678
It'll scare away all my customers.

35:56.762 --> 35:59.012
Nevertheless, Filipp Zilchenko
who owns the landfill,

35:59.096 --> 36:01.928
called the current ecological situation
normal,

36:02.012 --> 36:03.553
I quote, for a city

36:03.637 --> 36:04.971
built on a swamp.

36:05.929 --> 36:07.262
Help!

36:08.179 --> 36:10.304
-Please, don't!
-Come here!

36:11.012 --> 36:12.678
Relax or you'll make it worse!

36:12.762 --> 36:14.178
Please, let me go.

36:14.262 --> 36:16.803
First, we'll have a quickie.

36:16.887 --> 36:17.887
Please, don't.

36:18.762 --> 36:19.762
Hey bitches!

36:20.762 --> 36:21.971
Let the girl go!

36:23.012 --> 36:24.387
Or you wanna call the ambulance?

36:24.471 --> 36:25.679
You mean, the police?

36:26.596 --> 36:27.554
No.

36:28.471 --> 36:29.887
The police is already here.

36:29.971 --> 36:32.321
Hey you, hero.
You read too many comic strips…

36:34.804 --> 36:35.954
Can you hold it for me?

36:39.596 --> 36:40.554
You are a sicko!

36:50.137 --> 36:50.971
That's okay.

36:58.846 --> 37:00.887
I am lucky you are my neighbor.

37:08.554 --> 37:10.604
You don't have a lot of visitors, do you?

37:11.387 --> 37:12.221
Why?

37:13.637 --> 37:15.137
There's no door in the toilet.

37:16.096 --> 37:17.221
Right.

37:23.846 --> 37:25.179
How about a cup of tea?

37:25.721 --> 37:26.571
I'm okay, thanks.

37:32.637 --> 37:33.804
Yeah, I'll make one.

37:37.346 --> 37:38.387
Okay…

37:44.262 --> 37:45.304
How about some tea?

37:46.346 --> 37:47.512
Or better pasta?

38:02.179 --> 38:03.012
I am out of tea.

38:03.096 --> 38:04.762
I boiled you some water.

38:17.846 --> 38:20.178
The guy kicked your asses really hard.

38:20.262 --> 38:22.179
The schmuck nearly beat my face in.

38:23.846 --> 38:25.554
You look even better now.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.887
Hey you!

38:28.971 --> 38:30.637
That was not our deal.

38:30.721 --> 38:33.512
Shell out another ten
for pain and suffering.

38:33.596 --> 38:34.678
Or else you'll be sorry.

38:34.762 --> 38:36.721
No worries, guys.

38:45.846 --> 38:46.971
Whatever you say.

38:48.846 --> 38:50.137
You're a sicko!

38:56.887 --> 38:57.970
Grechkin Jr

38:58.054 --> 39:01.704
You got what you deserved. RIP, scumbag.
You had it coming, damn rich boy.

39:26.304 --> 39:27.429
Can you feel it?

39:28.554 --> 39:29.554
The air is so fresh.

39:30.512 --> 39:32.304
The city got a bit cleaner now.

39:34.096 --> 39:36.012
-Was it you?
-Me.

39:37.721 --> 39:38.887
Do you understand

39:38.971 --> 39:40.304
what you did?

39:41.054 --> 39:42.012
Sure.

39:43.137 --> 39:44.804
I delivered justice.

39:46.637 --> 39:47.596
Justice?

39:48.179 --> 39:49.637
Kinda.

39:51.012 --> 39:51.928
By the way, I'm sorry.

39:52.012 --> 39:55.346
I spent a hell of a lot of your money
to develop this thing but…

39:56.762 --> 39:58.221
I am kinda Batman now.

39:59.887 --> 40:02.137
But no. Batman never kills.

40:02.971 --> 40:04.346
I am cooler than him.

40:08.179 --> 40:09.179
Oleg.

40:11.179 --> 40:12.346
You killed a man.

40:29.137 --> 40:31.012
What would you want me to do?

40:32.512 --> 40:35.637
Visit Grechkin and put him in timeout?

40:36.512 --> 40:40.137
I'm the one who solves your problems.
In a hard and uncompromising way.

40:40.721 --> 40:43.971
You knew perfectly well
that I was going to kill him.

40:46.054 --> 40:47.554
But you never stopped me.

40:51.387 --> 40:53.971
Because you wanted him dead too.

40:58.221 --> 41:01.671
You know that these scumbags destroy
our city enjoying total impunity!

41:02.262 --> 41:04.346
And there's no other way to stop them!

41:05.721 --> 41:07.804
Don't be hysterical.

41:08.346 --> 41:09.646
And don't stand in my way.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.012
Let the fun begin!

41:40.179 --> 41:41.479
Our city is seriously ill.

41:42.512 --> 41:45.345
It's struck by a plague of corruption,

41:45.429 --> 41:48.012
greed and lawlessness.

41:48.887 --> 41:52.137
The law enforcement system was powerless

41:52.221 --> 41:54.137
to stop Kirill Grechkin.

41:54.846 --> 41:55.804
But I did it.

41:56.679 --> 42:00.845
His death was my first act of justice.

42:00.929 --> 42:02.887
I will stop at nothing

42:02.971 --> 42:06.762
to burn the disease out.

42:06.846 --> 42:07.762
For I am

42:08.429 --> 42:10.262
the Plague Doctor.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.304
Or do I sound too pretentious?

42:18.596 --> 42:22.345
Meet Olga Isayeva,

42:22.429 --> 42:25.012
the owner of Rosgarantbank.

42:25.637 --> 42:26.762
But wait,

42:27.262 --> 42:29.804
you know her perfectly well.

42:30.804 --> 42:31.762
Don't you?

42:32.762 --> 42:35.137
You were her clients,

42:35.221 --> 42:37.095
and Olga ripped you off.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.345
She evicted you,

42:39.429 --> 42:41.512
seized your property

42:41.596 --> 42:43.971
and sent collectors after you.

42:45.054 --> 42:46.846
Did I forget anything?

42:47.554 --> 42:50.254
Son of a bitch!
You don't know who you're messing with!

42:50.971 --> 42:52.012
You're finished.

42:52.096 --> 42:53.512
No.

42:53.596 --> 42:55.928
It's you who is finished.

42:56.012 --> 42:59.304
Together with your rotten bank.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.804
Tick tock.

43:03.304 --> 43:04.387
Clown!

43:04.471 --> 43:05.887
Who do you think you are?!

43:05.971 --> 43:08.220
I'm gonna destroy you!

43:08.304 --> 43:09.471
You're dead!

43:40.554 --> 43:43.262
That's all yours!

43:45.221 --> 43:48.928
Soon enough we'll have

43:49.012 --> 43:50.012
this city back.

43:55.012 --> 43:57.162
He's a sicko.
But these scumbags deserve it.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.470
The entire city is baffled.

44:01.554 --> 44:04.345
A masked vigilante
who calls himself Plague Doctor

44:04.429 --> 44:06.637
declared war against men of influence

44:06.721 --> 44:09.137
enjoying massive public support online.

44:09.221 --> 44:13.554
His unprecedently violent video got
over ten million views.

44:14.054 --> 44:16.345
And his channel
in the Vmeste social network had

44:16.429 --> 44:18.220
more than a million subscribers

44:18.304 --> 44:21.137
even before the police arrived
at the crime scene.

44:25.637 --> 44:27.095
It's hardcore.

44:27.179 --> 44:29.720
You tell me. I almost
spewed when I saw it.

44:29.804 --> 44:32.012
What happened to that orphan?

44:32.096 --> 44:33.262
They let him go.

44:33.346 --> 44:35.137
We should've listened to what Grom said.

44:35.221 --> 44:37.470
-Chew some gum, willya?
-I don't wanna any gum.

44:37.554 --> 44:40.595
The Plague Doctor means new justice.

44:40.679 --> 44:43.721
Shit, this psycho has got fans now.

44:47.721 --> 44:49.554
Gum! Give me some gum!

45:04.679 --> 45:05.762
Who is he?

45:06.679 --> 45:07.929
Meet Major Grom. I…

45:08.512 --> 45:09.596
I told you about him.

45:16.471 --> 45:17.928
Meet Yevgeniy Strelkov.

45:18.012 --> 45:19.596
He came all the way from Moscow

45:20.429 --> 45:22.803
to investigate the case
of the Plague Doctor.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.928
Thanks, I don't need any help.

45:25.012 --> 45:26.562
They didn't tell you, did they?

45:27.554 --> 45:29.428
Really, it's a bit embarrassing.

45:29.512 --> 45:30.928
But it's my case now.

45:31.012 --> 45:32.553
I'd love to keep you in the team,

45:32.637 --> 45:33.721
but…

45:34.512 --> 45:36.762
I am afraid
my superiors would never agree.

45:37.387 --> 45:38.887
Sorry. I have my orders.

45:39.929 --> 45:41.845
Can I help you in any way?

45:41.929 --> 45:43.471
You sure can.

45:45.054 --> 45:47.454
Two cups of coffee with milk.
No sugar for Misha.

45:48.221 --> 45:49.470
Excuse me. Igor!

45:49.554 --> 45:51.428
Why didn't you tell me?

45:51.512 --> 45:53.095
You think I'm your secretary?

45:53.179 --> 45:55.303
-They told me this morning.
-But it's my case!

45:55.387 --> 45:56.637
Relax!

45:56.721 --> 45:58.720
Big bosses kept calling me
all the night through.

45:58.804 --> 46:01.762
They gave me so many orders that I could
hardly put in Yes, sir. Get lost!

46:01.846 --> 46:02.679
Just a few questions!

46:02.763 --> 46:04.678
And now this asshole is here.

46:04.762 --> 46:05.595
Wait!

46:05.679 --> 46:08.053
Let's go to my place to have some borsch.

46:08.137 --> 46:10.096
I've got a super cool case for you.

46:10.762 --> 46:13.262
You'll never look back. You'll love it!

46:13.346 --> 46:15.221
Twelve fridges are gone?

46:15.721 --> 46:16.678
How cool is that!

46:16.762 --> 46:18.928
No, I mean, that's a terrible crime.

46:19.012 --> 46:21.012
And we're investigating it together now.

46:21.096 --> 46:22.512
I never expected it.

46:23.137 --> 46:24.720
Just yesterday, sir, you…

46:24.804 --> 46:28.387
Or may I drop the formalities
now that we're partners?

46:28.887 --> 46:30.637
I mean, Fyodor Ivanovich said that.

46:30.721 --> 46:33.429
I am so happy they made me your partner.

46:34.804 --> 46:36.720
But really!

46:36.804 --> 46:39.137
Who could have broken in a huge warehouse

46:39.221 --> 46:40.720
to take nothing except fridges?

46:40.804 --> 46:43.137
Why not TV sets or laptops?

46:44.054 --> 46:45.803
What if they had hijacked a truck?

46:45.887 --> 46:47.220
That would make the case big.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.178
Shit, I've got so many questions
but no answers.

46:49.262 --> 46:52.512
There's just one thing I'm sure about.
We must find and punish the thieves.

46:52.596 --> 46:54.804
We can't let them get away with it.

46:58.971 --> 46:59.804
Igor?

47:00.387 --> 47:01.346
Wait, Igor!

47:02.637 --> 47:03.637
Where are you going?

47:05.512 --> 47:09.762
I am asking the residents
of our city to stay calm.

47:09.846 --> 47:13.345
Let me assure you that we'll do our best
to detain the psycho

47:13.429 --> 47:15.803
and prosecute him
to the fullest extent of the law.

47:15.887 --> 47:17.346
Who investigates the case?

47:18.721 --> 47:20.221
They are the best men we have.

47:22.137 --> 47:24.054
Plague

47:32.471 --> 47:33.512
It stinks here!

47:34.054 --> 47:37.204
This landfill made the entire
neighborhood into a complete mess.

47:42.054 --> 47:43.504
Igor, what are we doing here?

47:45.971 --> 47:47.179
I'm looking for leads.

47:49.554 --> 47:51.762
No idea what you're doing here.

47:59.471 --> 48:01.470
Don't even think about telling them

48:01.554 --> 48:03.179
that you're a cop. Got it?

48:06.512 --> 48:08.137
Hey, what're you looking at?

48:08.971 --> 48:10.137
Hey you, come here!

48:16.679 --> 48:17.804
Who's the squeaker?

48:21.554 --> 48:22.471
Hey guys.

48:33.054 --> 48:34.096
You wait here.

48:38.762 --> 48:42.262
The hell you doing, bro?
I spent half an hour building this shit.

48:42.346 --> 48:43.221
Hey man.

48:45.304 --> 48:47.404
-Some things never change, right?
-Come on.

48:49.429 --> 48:50.387
What's buzzin'?

48:58.971 --> 49:01.371
What can you tell me
about the 12 stolen fridges?

49:02.679 --> 49:03.887
No way, man.

49:03.971 --> 49:06.887
I'd never do any business
with such a dumbass.

49:06.971 --> 49:08.387
I'd never even sit down next to him.

49:08.471 --> 49:10.346
No idea who did it.

49:12.721 --> 49:13.720
But…

49:13.804 --> 49:16.678
I know a couple of dudes
who can probably help.

49:16.762 --> 49:19.387
I can give you a list if you want.

49:19.471 --> 49:20.637
Do me a favor, bro.

49:21.221 --> 49:24.929
Fuzz. You wanna nothing else
but free favors.

49:25.679 --> 49:27.928
That doesn't work around here.

49:28.012 --> 49:29.512
Cut the bullshit.

49:30.054 --> 49:32.345
Before I ask you
where this dough is coming from.

49:32.429 --> 49:34.079
-Threatening me, bitch boy?
-Yeah.

49:34.637 --> 49:37.337
Do you want me to tell your mom
what you're doing here?

49:38.262 --> 49:39.595
Oh man!

49:39.679 --> 49:41.928
Don't give me this bullshit, please!

49:42.012 --> 49:43.512
-Don't do that.
-Come on.

49:43.596 --> 49:45.595
I'll make you a nice list right now.

49:45.679 --> 49:47.762
-No mistakes.
-Sit tight!

49:47.846 --> 49:50.970
If you get to know anything
about the fridges, call me, okay?

49:51.054 --> 49:52.345
I left my number here.

49:52.429 --> 49:53.596
Sure thing, bro.

49:54.137 --> 49:55.887
Seryoga. That's you, for real.

49:57.512 --> 49:58.470
Thanks, pals.

49:58.554 --> 50:00.428
Behave yourself.

50:00.512 --> 50:01.862
They're respectable people.

50:02.429 --> 50:03.346
I'm done.

50:11.929 --> 50:13.929
You've got a piece of shit for the door.

50:14.762 --> 50:15.970
Hey bitches!

50:16.054 --> 50:17.387
I need information.

50:43.262 --> 50:44.096
Who is he?

50:44.721 --> 50:45.554
What?

50:46.179 --> 50:47.012
Tell me.

50:50.346 --> 50:52.137
I don't know.

50:52.679 --> 50:53.512
Okay then.

50:55.221 --> 50:56.345
I don't know…

50:56.429 --> 50:57.678
I don't know…

50:57.762 --> 50:58.887
…anything.

50:58.971 --> 51:00.137
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

51:06.887 --> 51:07.804
Over there.

51:17.262 --> 51:19.137
Are you okay?

51:22.679 --> 51:25.779
I can't believe we're investigating
the Plague Doctor together.

51:28.012 --> 51:29.137
Together… Vmeste…

51:31.637 --> 51:32.596
I'm an idiot.

51:36.429 --> 51:37.879
What are we going to do next?

51:44.304 --> 51:46.720
-You're going back to the station.
-Got it.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.220
-You write a report.
-Okay.

51:48.304 --> 51:50.553
On how we spent the whole day
looking for the fridges.

51:50.637 --> 51:52.437
-I wanna see it when I'm back.
-Okay.

52:06.887 --> 52:08.762
Sergey, you have a visitor.

52:09.762 --> 52:11.846
-I'm busy.
-A police officer.

52:13.554 --> 52:14.387
No kidding.

52:24.346 --> 52:25.846
Police Major Igor Grom.

52:26.721 --> 52:27.721
Hello.

52:30.429 --> 52:32.379
Would you like any tea, coffee or soda?

52:33.346 --> 52:34.346
Wow.

52:36.054 --> 52:37.471
Why is it that big?

52:40.012 --> 52:41.762
When I was a kid,

52:41.846 --> 52:45.137
I felt jealous about those who could
afford to buy these things.

52:46.637 --> 52:48.554
Closing my open Gestalt now.

52:49.637 --> 52:52.303
-Making up for the lost time?
-Kind of.

52:52.387 --> 52:53.346
Cool.

52:54.762 --> 52:57.178
I came to talk about the video
of the Plague Doctor.

52:57.262 --> 52:58.970
That's what I thought.

52:59.054 --> 53:01.053
I deleted the original one.

53:01.137 --> 53:04.762
But it made people post
more and more duplicates.

53:04.846 --> 53:07.262
Our algorithm prioritized this video

53:07.346 --> 53:09.678
-and shared it to the feeds…
-That's not why I came.

53:09.762 --> 53:13.012
I wanna find the owner of the smartphone
used to stream the video.

53:13.929 --> 53:16.303
Decentralized encryption
makes it impossible

53:16.387 --> 53:18.804
to track down the users.

53:19.596 --> 53:21.746
I am afraid
it's technologically unfeasible.

53:25.221 --> 53:28.303
Why build a system you can't control?

53:28.387 --> 53:31.304
Because freedom of expression is
a fundamental human right.

53:32.721 --> 53:34.929
You wanted
to promote freedom of expression.

53:35.429 --> 53:38.721
But instead you gave
a voice to a serial killer.

53:42.971 --> 53:44.262
And you…

53:45.512 --> 53:47.412
What have you got to do with the case?

53:49.012 --> 53:51.137
I mean, someone…

53:51.846 --> 53:55.595
Your smiley face colleague came here.
We already discussed it with him.

53:55.679 --> 53:58.012
Yes, he asked me to fill in some dots.

54:01.387 --> 54:03.053
Don't worry, I won't report you.

54:03.137 --> 54:05.987
The more people investigate
the Plague Doctor, the better.

54:18.429 --> 54:21.887
Who the hell are you,
big-nosed pterodactyl?

54:22.387 --> 54:24.887
Igor! Here is my report.
You wanted to see it.

54:26.971 --> 54:27.921
Get out of the way.

54:29.221 --> 54:30.571
I spent my whole day on it.

54:31.304 --> 54:33.345
And I found something.

54:33.429 --> 54:35.012
-Look on page four…
-Not now.

54:40.637 --> 54:42.262
Igor.

54:44.221 --> 54:46.054
Yulia Pchyolkina posted a new video.

54:46.721 --> 54:48.304
It's about the Plague Doctor.

54:49.096 --> 54:50.512
It may be useful.

54:53.221 --> 54:56.721
I got hold of the photos taken
at the Kirill Grechkin's murder site.

54:57.221 --> 54:59.095
He was the Plague Doctor's first victim.

54:59.179 --> 55:02.137
You can easily see
that the poor boy attempted to escape.

55:02.221 --> 55:06.220
But he suffered the fate of the bear
from a well-known joke.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.720
Say again. Who is she?

55:07.804 --> 55:10.262
-You don't know Yulia Pchyolkina?
-No.

55:10.346 --> 55:13.553
She's a star. She investigates cases
and posts her videos.

55:13.637 --> 55:15.887
The police composite confirms the fact

55:15.971 --> 55:18.220
that cops knew about him
from the beginning.

55:18.304 --> 55:19.928
But they did nothing to stop the man.

55:20.012 --> 55:21.637
Look, this is my drawing.

55:22.304 --> 55:23.137
Cool!

55:24.304 --> 55:25.137
Wait a second.

55:25.762 --> 55:26.812
Where did she get it?

55:27.721 --> 55:29.220
And other documents too?

55:29.304 --> 55:31.262
Have we got a rat around here?

55:34.054 --> 55:36.887
Look. You don't have
any work to do, do you?

55:40.387 --> 55:43.387
First of all, we must find
the Plague Doctor. Right, partner?

55:44.137 --> 55:45.304
First of all,

55:47.262 --> 55:48.929
you must find the fridges.

55:49.762 --> 55:51.262
Freon. Search!

55:53.387 --> 55:55.178
I'm done for today.

55:55.262 --> 55:56.312
But you keep working.

55:56.929 --> 55:58.178
There.

55:58.262 --> 55:59.346
Have some coffee.

56:07.971 --> 56:10.929
A smile makes a dark day brighter

56:11.679 --> 56:14.929
A smile can bring a rainbow to the sky

56:15.721 --> 56:18.179
Share your smile

56:19.179 --> 56:22.387
And it will often come back to you

56:23.012 --> 56:26.595
And then all of a sudden
the clouds will start dancing

56:26.679 --> 56:29.887
And the grasshopper will start
playing the violin…

56:30.596 --> 56:32.246
I thought you asked for some tea.

56:35.762 --> 56:37.554
Wanna tell me how you got in here?

56:38.804 --> 56:39.637
Nope.

56:42.346 --> 56:43.721
Wanna say you're sorry?

56:45.887 --> 56:46.721
No.

56:51.179 --> 56:53.012
We got off to a bad start.

56:56.637 --> 56:59.471
You know that your shenanigans could
cost me my job?

57:00.512 --> 57:01.596
Shit happens.

57:02.762 --> 57:04.137
Shit happens?

57:04.221 --> 57:05.137
Really?

57:05.762 --> 57:07.062
What do you want me to do?

57:08.721 --> 57:10.929
Kneel at your feet and beg for mercy?

57:13.304 --> 57:14.721
It's every man for himself.

57:23.512 --> 57:24.471
Look, darling.

57:25.012 --> 57:26.862
You better think about yourself then.

57:27.429 --> 57:30.729
One more trick like this will turn
the star of Internet into a star

57:31.596 --> 57:32.796
of our detention center.

57:35.512 --> 57:36.803
Took you long to invent this one?

57:36.887 --> 57:38.221
Ten minutes or so.

57:41.137 --> 57:43.845
-While I was giving a bath to your laptop.
-What?

57:43.929 --> 57:45.387
It was too dirty.

57:46.054 --> 57:47.054
Meaning what?

57:56.679 --> 57:57.512
You motherf…

57:57.596 --> 58:01.387
A river begins with a blue stream

58:01.471 --> 58:04.929
And real friendship begins with a smile

58:20.137 --> 58:22.262
Fouling his own nest

58:24.512 --> 58:25.554
Meet

58:26.429 --> 58:28.304
Filipp Zilchenko.

58:29.054 --> 58:31.804
He has a waste
and recycling monopoly in the city.

58:33.429 --> 58:34.929
And here is

58:35.471 --> 58:37.554
his masterpiece.

58:44.471 --> 58:47.428
Babies are born with defects.

58:47.512 --> 58:50.220
People suffer from terrible diseases.

58:50.304 --> 58:52.304
The city is suffocating

58:52.804 --> 58:54.679
because of…

58:56.429 --> 58:58.012
…this man here.

59:00.221 --> 59:01.137
I'm begging you.

59:01.221 --> 59:03.137
It's not my fault. Please!

59:03.221 --> 59:05.220
Spare my family! I…

59:05.304 --> 59:07.220
Your dump killed

59:07.304 --> 59:09.846
thousands of people.

59:10.471 --> 59:11.971
The same is going to happen

59:12.721 --> 59:14.971
to your family now.

59:16.221 --> 59:18.220
Let's make a deal!

59:18.304 --> 59:19.179
No.

59:27.221 --> 59:29.053
The Plague Doctor committed

59:29.137 --> 59:30.470
another extremely brutal murder.

59:30.554 --> 59:34.137
The Plague Doctor…

59:34.221 --> 59:35.928
He is a complete nutcase.

59:36.012 --> 59:37.220
Why kill the kid?

59:37.304 --> 59:40.678
A fighter for justice
or a megalomaniac and a sociopath?

59:40.762 --> 59:42.887
Criminals enjoy their total impunity.

59:42.971 --> 59:45.053
The people turn to rioting and looting.

59:45.137 --> 59:47.346
It's insane! What are you doing?!

59:50.804 --> 59:54.553
You can buy a mask like this one
in numerous online stores.

59:54.637 --> 59:56.553
It costs mere 99 rubles.

59:56.637 --> 59:57.595
Put a ban on it!

59:57.679 --> 1:00:00.220
Law enforcement agencies claim
they are doing their best

1:00:00.304 --> 1:00:02.262
but the crime rate is rising too fast.

1:00:02.346 --> 1:00:05.054
Sensible people know
that he crossed the line.

1:00:05.846 --> 1:00:06.928
No comment.

1:00:07.012 --> 1:00:09.095
It's embarrassing but we must admit

1:00:09.179 --> 1:00:11.329
that the serial killer
became a super star.

1:00:12.387 --> 1:00:14.346
You are… You are insane.

1:00:15.929 --> 1:00:17.729
Why did you kill the entire family?!

1:00:22.304 --> 1:00:24.054
You saw what's going on out there?!

1:00:26.304 --> 1:00:28.221
Oleg, these people are your followers!

1:00:32.721 --> 1:00:34.054
You must stop.

1:00:35.637 --> 1:00:37.137
Or else I'm going to stop you.

1:00:41.304 --> 1:00:43.096
And what are you going to do?

1:00:46.221 --> 1:00:47.054
I…

1:00:50.054 --> 1:00:51.470
You'll be no longer supported.

1:00:51.554 --> 1:00:52.971
I'll switch off the servers!

1:00:55.596 --> 1:00:57.296
I'll shut down the social network.

1:01:02.137 --> 1:01:02.971
You mean…

1:01:04.596 --> 1:01:07.429
You want to give up
your lifetime project for…

1:01:08.471 --> 1:01:10.429
…for a handful of fat scumbags?

1:01:13.179 --> 1:01:17.096
Will that make the people's lives better?

1:01:18.887 --> 1:01:20.512
Was that your dream?

1:01:26.137 --> 1:01:27.304
I'm calling the cops.

1:01:28.346 --> 1:01:31.429
Sergey, you want me
to call in emergency services?

1:01:44.429 --> 1:01:48.471
Don't forget to tell them you knew
about it from the very beginning.

1:01:56.054 --> 1:01:57.054
Oleg!

1:01:57.804 --> 1:01:58.845
Listen to me!

1:01:58.929 --> 1:01:59.928
I'm asking you…

1:02:00.012 --> 1:02:02.429
No, I'm begging you, you hear?!

1:02:03.429 --> 1:02:04.887
You're gotta stop.

1:02:06.721 --> 1:02:07.846
No.

1:02:27.554 --> 1:02:28.721
Igor, are you in there?

1:02:31.512 --> 1:02:34.262
You didn't come to the station today.
Are you okay?

1:02:39.012 --> 1:02:39.929
Hi.

1:02:41.054 --> 1:02:42.754
They told me, you love this stuff.

1:02:46.971 --> 1:02:48.054
Okay.

1:02:50.679 --> 1:02:52.137
You have five minutes.

1:02:52.221 --> 1:02:54.262
You know what the Plague Doctor did?

1:02:54.346 --> 1:02:55.846
The whole city is going crazy.

1:02:56.721 --> 1:02:57.771
We must get him asap.

1:02:58.304 --> 1:03:00.428
-Did you find the stolen fridges?
-I…

1:03:00.512 --> 1:03:02.012
I feel frozen out without you.

1:03:03.887 --> 1:03:06.187
Did you buy the sandwich
by the subway station?

1:03:08.346 --> 1:03:09.637
No potatoes next time.

1:03:13.054 --> 1:03:14.012
So stuffy in here.

1:03:14.637 --> 1:03:17.970
May I open the window? Oh, cool!

1:03:18.054 --> 1:03:20.904
Did you develop the criminal profile
of the Plague Doctor?

1:03:22.721 --> 1:03:25.271
They taught us how to do that
in the Police Academy.

1:03:25.846 --> 1:03:27.596
What type of a serial killer is he?

1:03:29.971 --> 1:03:31.928
Ah, he's mission-oriented.

1:03:32.012 --> 1:03:33.553
Pension-oriented…

1:03:33.637 --> 1:03:35.095
He pursues his ultimate goal

1:03:35.179 --> 1:03:37.095
and kills for the sake of his ideals.

1:03:37.179 --> 1:03:38.346
But why make videos?

1:03:38.846 --> 1:03:40.387
Is it about sublimation?

1:03:40.471 --> 1:03:41.804
He wants attention.

1:03:42.387 --> 1:03:45.095
Video streaming helps him

1:03:45.179 --> 1:03:46.220
compensate for the lack of it.

1:03:46.304 --> 1:03:48.553
Yeah, childhood is the key
with these psychos.

1:03:48.637 --> 1:03:50.187
Probably he was a lonely child.

1:03:50.721 --> 1:03:52.512
Or an orphan. Look, Igor.

1:03:53.429 --> 1:03:54.553
We need a list of…

1:03:54.637 --> 1:03:57.303
Forget about it.
We'll never identify the badass.

1:03:57.387 --> 1:03:59.595
We have no evidence.
We don't know his accomplices.

1:03:59.679 --> 1:04:02.095
We can only nail him at the crime scene.

1:04:02.179 --> 1:04:04.304
You analyzed the pattern.

1:04:05.096 --> 1:04:07.220
He's raising the stakes with every murder.

1:04:07.304 --> 1:04:08.637
Look at Grechkin.

1:04:08.721 --> 1:04:10.512
He destroyed the life of a single person.

1:04:10.596 --> 1:04:12.220
Isayeva ripped off several hundreds.

1:04:12.304 --> 1:04:14.637
With Zilchenko we're talking
about thousands.

1:04:14.721 --> 1:04:17.012
That means that his next victim is someone

1:04:17.096 --> 1:04:19.512
everybody hates.

1:04:19.596 --> 1:04:20.996
You know who that person is?

1:04:22.679 --> 1:04:23.512
It's you.

1:04:26.637 --> 1:04:27.637
I don't know.

1:04:27.721 --> 1:04:30.021
There are too many
crazy moneybags in the city.

1:04:30.804 --> 1:04:33.904
If I were one of them, I would hide
in some underground bunker.

1:04:38.096 --> 1:04:38.970
Right.

1:04:39.054 --> 1:04:41.471
They open the Golden Dragon
casino tonight.

1:04:45.304 --> 1:04:48.554
Most of the people from the list
will be there. Look, Igor.

1:04:49.137 --> 1:04:50.096
Look.

1:04:50.596 --> 1:04:53.554
The Golden Dragon casino is opening
in Saint Petersburg.

1:04:56.596 --> 1:04:57.679
You're good.

1:05:00.804 --> 1:05:03.262
We should warn Strelkov now.

1:05:03.929 --> 1:05:05.054
Are you nuts?

1:05:05.596 --> 1:05:08.470
He'll arrive with a special op army.

1:05:08.554 --> 1:05:11.012
He'll scare away the Plague Doctor
and totally screw it up.

1:05:11.096 --> 1:05:13.720
Cool. Then it's the two of us, right?

1:05:13.804 --> 1:05:15.928
-Coz we're partners.
-The two of us?

1:05:16.012 --> 1:05:17.678
We're no partners.

1:05:17.762 --> 1:05:18.637
Got it?

1:05:18.721 --> 1:05:19.762
Come on.

1:05:19.846 --> 1:05:22.137
We balance out the weak points
of each other.

1:05:24.012 --> 1:05:25.712
What are my weak points, I wonder?

1:05:26.512 --> 1:05:27.346
Well…

1:05:28.346 --> 1:05:30.012
Honestly speaking, you…

1:05:30.596 --> 1:05:31.896
You often break the rules.

1:05:33.304 --> 1:05:35.854
You're in charge
of my professional development now?

1:05:36.887 --> 1:05:39.512
There are standard interrogation
and arrest procedures

1:05:39.596 --> 1:05:41.679
which we must follow.

1:05:47.471 --> 1:05:48.596
Look here.

1:05:49.929 --> 1:05:53.095
A masked sociopath armed with bombs
and flamethrowers is out there.

1:05:53.179 --> 1:05:55.529
Wanna try to catch him
following the procedures?

1:05:56.596 --> 1:06:00.053
He'll burn the city to the ground
before I prepare all the papers.

1:06:00.137 --> 1:06:04.804
If I follow the rules hunting bad guys,
I'll never get any of them. Know why?

1:06:06.179 --> 1:06:07.428
Because they follow no rules.

1:06:07.512 --> 1:06:09.512
What makes you different from them then?

1:06:10.762 --> 1:06:12.720
Yesterday you punched the guys
to get some info.

1:06:12.804 --> 1:06:14.845
What are you going to do tomorrow?

1:06:14.929 --> 1:06:16.553
I'll kick the shit out of people again.

1:06:16.637 --> 1:06:18.803
You're crossing the line and you'll become

1:06:18.887 --> 1:06:21.554
-another criminal.
-I know my limits.

1:06:22.221 --> 1:06:23.887
I never kill anyone.

1:06:25.512 --> 1:06:26.387
One day you will.

1:06:26.471 --> 1:06:29.303
Okay. Get out. Your time is up.

1:06:29.387 --> 1:06:30.429
Go.

1:06:54.096 --> 1:06:56.220
Are you going to lose this cap or what?

1:06:56.304 --> 1:06:58.254
Or are you a part-time taxi driver now?

1:07:00.179 --> 1:07:01.079
You got an invite?

1:07:01.887 --> 1:07:03.428
It was not easy at all.

1:07:03.512 --> 1:07:06.303
I didn't have to go to a sauna
with big shots

1:07:06.387 --> 1:07:07.987
but anyway it was quite a sweat.

1:07:10.721 --> 1:07:12.845
You don't think much of me, Grom.

1:07:12.929 --> 1:07:14.512
Come on, dude!

1:07:14.596 --> 1:07:16.178
If that was the case,

1:07:16.262 --> 1:07:19.178
you would've gone to jail a long time ago.
For the money shit you do.

1:07:19.262 --> 1:07:20.678
-Come on!
-Cool wheels!

1:07:20.762 --> 1:07:22.970
Sure thing. B means boosted.

1:07:23.054 --> 1:07:25.904
You know, someone hijacked
exactly the same one last week.

1:07:26.804 --> 1:07:28.262
-Really?
-Really.

1:07:28.346 --> 1:07:30.262
-No kidding?
-No kidding. The keys.

1:07:31.387 --> 1:07:33.470
-What d'ya mean?
-Give me the keys.

1:07:33.554 --> 1:07:34.454
Having a go at me?

1:07:43.429 --> 1:07:44.595
Can I have your keys?

1:07:44.679 --> 1:07:45.729
Take good care of it.

1:07:46.471 --> 1:07:47.921
And don't touch the flat cap.

1:07:48.554 --> 1:07:50.512
Hey man. You've got a cool car.

1:07:50.596 --> 1:07:53.296
I had a car like yours too.
They hijacked it last week.

1:07:54.387 --> 1:07:55.512
Case solved.

1:08:42.846 --> 1:08:45.553
Congratulations

1:08:45.637 --> 1:08:46.846
on the opening

1:08:47.387 --> 1:08:48.887
of my new casino -

1:08:49.929 --> 1:08:51.679
The Golden Dragon.

1:08:53.096 --> 1:08:55.387
I'd like to drink

1:08:56.137 --> 1:08:58.096
to everyone here.

1:08:59.054 --> 1:09:00.470
Because we are

1:09:00.554 --> 1:09:03.845
cream of the crop in this city.

1:09:03.929 --> 1:09:06.012
Here's to us! Hurrah!

1:09:27.304 --> 1:09:29.137
Shanghai is not interesting.

1:09:29.846 --> 1:09:31.221
Beijing is too provincial.

1:09:31.846 --> 1:09:33.304
Saint Petersburg is the place

1:09:33.846 --> 1:09:35.929
where we can do some serious stuff.

1:09:36.637 --> 1:09:38.803
The city is at our feet, gentlemen.

1:09:38.887 --> 1:09:41.304
-You again.
-Happy to see you too.

1:09:43.429 --> 1:09:44.720
-What's this?
-It's a bug.

1:09:44.804 --> 1:09:46.704
Never seen these things? Give it back.

1:09:47.429 --> 1:09:48.846
What are you doing here?

1:09:50.721 --> 1:09:53.262
What can a reporter do
at a billionaires' party?

1:09:53.762 --> 1:09:54.595
I don't know.

1:09:54.679 --> 1:09:56.929
What is a policeman doing here?

1:09:57.721 --> 1:09:59.179
Wearing a fancy suit?

1:10:00.596 --> 1:10:03.595
-You work undercover?
-Come on.

1:10:03.679 --> 1:10:04.887
Time to go home.

1:10:07.846 --> 1:10:09.596
If you behave like an idiot

1:10:10.304 --> 1:10:13.179
they'll kick both of us out. Got it?
Wanna dance?

1:10:18.387 --> 1:10:19.587
May I ask you something?

1:10:20.096 --> 1:10:21.678
About the Plague Doctor?

1:10:21.762 --> 1:10:24.387
What do I think about him?
He's a murderer - plain and simple.

1:10:24.471 --> 1:10:26.303
The people in the streets would not agree.

1:10:26.387 --> 1:10:28.678
You know they call him a new Robin Hood?

1:10:28.762 --> 1:10:32.345
I don't give a shit. I'm gonna shoot
the asshole down. End of story.

1:10:32.429 --> 1:10:33.596
My turn now.

1:10:38.846 --> 1:10:41.387
Why you have so many negative vibes
in your videos?

1:10:42.262 --> 1:10:44.970
Why don't you show
true heroes of the city?

1:10:45.054 --> 1:10:46.429
Who's that?

1:10:51.012 --> 1:10:52.720
Razumovskiy, for example?

1:10:52.804 --> 1:10:53.887
Razumovskiy?

1:10:53.971 --> 1:10:55.012
He's not a hero.

1:10:55.596 --> 1:10:57.345
The people in the streets would not agree.

1:10:57.429 --> 1:10:58.721
The people in the streets

1:10:59.346 --> 1:11:01.262
know nothing about his shady deals.

1:11:02.971 --> 1:11:06.021
His contract with HOLT International says
a lot about the man.

1:11:11.304 --> 1:11:13.971
I'm gonna make you rich.

1:11:17.304 --> 1:11:19.137
Sweetie, will you show them out?

1:11:24.346 --> 1:11:25.221
Hi.

1:11:26.554 --> 1:11:29.304
Look who's here!

1:11:31.096 --> 1:11:32.928
Happy that you dropped in.

1:11:33.012 --> 1:11:35.512
That was a great speech, Albert Adamovich.

1:11:35.596 --> 1:11:38.971
Too bad you forgot to mention
how you got hold

1:11:39.471 --> 1:11:42.095
of this fantastic place.

1:11:42.179 --> 1:11:43.721
Everybody knows it.

1:11:44.304 --> 1:11:47.262
They demolished this old shack
making the plot available.

1:11:47.346 --> 1:11:50.178
What you called a shack

1:11:50.262 --> 1:11:52.053
was a historic building.

1:11:52.137 --> 1:11:54.762
Seryozha, don't start that again!

1:11:55.512 --> 1:11:57.012
I got it all covered.

1:11:58.137 --> 1:11:59.762
I've got all the papers.

1:11:59.846 --> 1:12:01.762
The shack was not subject to…

1:12:01.846 --> 1:12:03.471
-What you call it?
-Restoration.

1:12:05.262 --> 1:12:06.428
Restoration.

1:12:06.512 --> 1:12:07.845
Look around!

1:12:07.929 --> 1:12:10.804
I know how you obtained the authorization.

1:12:11.429 --> 1:12:12.637
Just think about it.

1:12:13.512 --> 1:12:16.637
The building survived
the Bolshevik revolution,

1:12:16.721 --> 1:12:17.762
and the Civil War

1:12:18.762 --> 1:12:20.345
and the Siege.

1:12:20.429 --> 1:12:22.387
But you and your casino are worse

1:12:22.471 --> 1:12:24.012
than any disaster.

1:12:24.554 --> 1:12:27.637
-Can you give me a phone?
-HOLT… It rings a bell.

1:12:28.304 --> 1:12:29.262
What's it?

1:12:30.512 --> 1:12:33.962
Nothing special. One of the largest weapon
manufacturers in the world.

1:12:35.429 --> 1:12:36.596
Thank you.

1:12:38.137 --> 1:12:40.596
You can trust me.
There're no heroes in this city.

1:12:41.137 --> 1:12:43.287
I'll be the first to know
when we have one.

1:12:44.387 --> 1:12:47.137
Year after year you profit off
ordinary people.

1:12:47.221 --> 1:12:49.012
Remember this simple thing.

1:12:50.137 --> 1:12:51.887
You won't need money when you die.

1:12:51.971 --> 1:12:55.262
Think about that
when you count your billions.

1:12:56.096 --> 1:12:57.196
Little son of a bitch.

1:12:58.429 --> 1:13:00.303
I don't wanna dirty my hands.

1:13:00.387 --> 1:13:01.887
Security!

1:13:01.971 --> 1:13:04.137
Kick him out of here!

1:13:12.012 --> 1:13:14.762
Well? You're done, bastards!

1:13:14.846 --> 1:13:16.179
Let's rock'n'roll!

1:13:16.887 --> 1:13:17.887
Take cover!

1:13:25.762 --> 1:13:26.929
Screw it!

1:13:29.387 --> 1:13:30.554
I must go there.

1:13:33.429 --> 1:13:34.304
Dima.

1:13:34.846 --> 1:13:36.096
Are you in a hurry?

1:13:37.512 --> 1:13:38.471
Sit down.

1:13:42.262 --> 1:13:45.762
Can you tell me about the investigation
you conduct together with Grom?

1:13:46.346 --> 1:13:47.596
It's routine police work.

1:13:48.137 --> 1:13:49.887
We look around and interview people

1:13:50.637 --> 1:13:52.387
searching for the fridges.

1:13:52.471 --> 1:13:53.471
Boring.

1:13:54.304 --> 1:13:56.720
Dima, you're such a bad liar.

1:13:56.804 --> 1:13:59.512
I know perfectly well that you and Grom

1:13:59.596 --> 1:14:01.887
investigate the case of the Plague Doctor.

1:14:01.971 --> 1:14:04.637
I'm sure that was not your idea.

1:14:04.721 --> 1:14:05.928
You know,

1:14:06.012 --> 1:14:08.387
what Major Grom does is illegal.

1:14:08.471 --> 1:14:12.012
You help him to investigate the case.
And this is a crime too.

1:14:13.887 --> 1:14:15.096
Yevgeniy Borisovich,

1:14:15.762 --> 1:14:17.012
are you interrogating me?

1:14:22.971 --> 1:14:23.971
Listen, sucker.

1:14:24.762 --> 1:14:26.312
I'm tired of being nice to you.

1:14:27.804 --> 1:14:29.012
You've got two options.

1:14:29.887 --> 1:14:33.512
You tell me everything
and I forget our little talk.

1:14:34.096 --> 1:14:35.678
Or you keep telling me lies.

1:14:35.762 --> 1:14:38.720
Then I'll make your life a true hell.

1:14:38.804 --> 1:14:39.762
I can do it.

1:14:40.762 --> 1:14:41.762
And I love doing it.

1:14:44.554 --> 1:14:45.512
Well?

1:14:59.429 --> 1:15:00.554
We struggle

1:15:01.304 --> 1:15:04.554
to live off our meager salaries.

1:15:05.221 --> 1:15:07.262
But you're in clover.

1:15:07.346 --> 1:15:09.846
You pig out and have fun.

1:15:10.887 --> 1:15:12.428
Now it's time

1:15:12.512 --> 1:15:14.137
to pay the piper, right?

1:15:15.262 --> 1:15:17.262
Excuse me!

1:15:17.346 --> 1:15:18.220
Please!

1:15:18.304 --> 1:15:20.221
-Hear me out!
-Let him talk.

1:15:22.596 --> 1:15:24.512
I know why you are here.

1:15:24.596 --> 1:15:26.345
But violence is not a solution.

1:15:26.429 --> 1:15:27.429
What do you want?

1:15:28.387 --> 1:15:30.303
You want money? We'll give you money.

1:15:30.387 --> 1:15:32.762
Let's try to negotiate a deal.

1:15:32.846 --> 1:15:35.303
-Wanna earn some money?
-My name is Sergey.

1:15:35.387 --> 1:15:36.596
Sergey Razumovskiy.

1:15:39.221 --> 1:15:41.096
The Sergey Razumovskiy.

1:15:42.471 --> 1:15:44.137
We're lucky, right, dudes?

1:15:51.387 --> 1:15:53.387
Tell me, Sergey Razumovskiy.

1:15:53.471 --> 1:15:55.345
You wanna bribe us?

1:15:55.429 --> 1:15:56.554
You know what?

1:15:57.054 --> 1:15:59.096
We're gonna take it all anyway!

1:16:03.512 --> 1:16:04.970
Who did it?!

1:16:05.054 --> 1:16:06.929
Think!

1:16:07.846 --> 1:16:08.803
Get him!

1:16:08.887 --> 1:16:09.887
No time to think.

1:16:11.429 --> 1:16:12.637
Finish him off!

1:16:14.887 --> 1:16:16.678
What are you waiting for? Go!

1:16:16.762 --> 1:16:17.637
Get him!

1:16:52.471 --> 1:16:53.346
You!

1:17:06.721 --> 1:17:08.429
Wanna play a hero?

1:17:09.054 --> 1:17:10.096
Chill out, will ya?

1:17:23.096 --> 1:17:24.262
Hands up in the air!

1:17:27.679 --> 1:17:29.554
We're in!

1:17:32.804 --> 1:17:33.904
Let's get out of here!

1:17:34.587 --> 1:17:36.837
Hands up! Drop to the floor!

1:17:37.671 --> 1:17:39.212
Sector One clear!

1:17:39.296 --> 1:17:40.129
Face the floor!

1:17:40.213 --> 1:17:42.363
Hands on the back of
your head! Legs apart!

1:17:43.087 --> 1:17:44.637
-Face the floor!
-Don't look up!

1:17:52.254 --> 1:17:53.337
Those were copycats.

1:17:54.171 --> 1:17:55.878
Several of them escaped.

1:17:55.962 --> 1:17:57.004
We got the rest.

1:17:58.004 --> 1:17:58.879
Good job.

1:18:01.671 --> 1:18:02.721
Take them to the van!

1:18:08.337 --> 1:18:09.546
You saved my life.

1:18:10.671 --> 1:18:11.879
I wanted to thank you.

1:18:13.171 --> 1:18:14.087
No big deal.

1:18:16.046 --> 1:18:18.754
You rock, dude! You're a real man.

1:18:26.504 --> 1:18:27.421
Igor!

1:18:28.546 --> 1:18:30.379
If you need anything,

1:18:31.087 --> 1:18:32.212
I'll be happy to help.

1:18:41.087 --> 1:18:42.545
I'm absolutely sure

1:18:42.629 --> 1:18:44.670
that it's the impact of social media.

1:18:44.754 --> 1:18:45.796
Talk to the girl.

1:18:48.879 --> 1:18:50.795
Miss, you can't film here.

1:18:50.879 --> 1:18:51.712
I'm a reporter.

1:18:51.797 --> 1:18:53.130
That was good timing.

1:18:54.046 --> 1:18:55.796
Well? How are we doing?

1:18:56.379 --> 1:18:57.587
Everything is under control?

1:18:57.671 --> 1:18:58.671
We're doing great.

1:18:59.462 --> 1:19:00.337
You aren't.

1:19:01.546 --> 1:19:03.337
-Why's that?
-Just because.

1:19:09.129 --> 1:19:10.087
You're fired.

1:19:15.671 --> 1:19:16.629
Igor!

1:19:18.004 --> 1:19:19.712
That was awesome! Simply…

1:19:20.337 --> 1:19:23.037
…wow! I filmed it all.
Can you say a couple of words?

1:19:24.046 --> 1:19:25.587
-Can you give it to me?
-Okay?

1:19:40.212 --> 1:19:42.420
…obstructing justice,

1:19:42.504 --> 1:19:45.670
negligence in danger assessment,

1:19:45.754 --> 1:19:47.753
excess of authority…

1:19:47.837 --> 1:19:50.671
Your partner threw you under the bus. Now.

1:19:52.421 --> 1:19:54.837
Either you kick him out

1:19:54.921 --> 1:19:57.221
or I'll send this file
up the chain of command.

1:19:58.004 --> 1:19:59.962
-You…
-Fyodor Ivanovich!

1:20:00.504 --> 1:20:01.546
Take it easy.

1:20:05.004 --> 1:20:05.837
What are you…

1:20:06.587 --> 1:20:07.546
I quit the job.

1:20:17.962 --> 1:20:19.045
No.

1:20:19.129 --> 1:20:20.129
That's okay.

1:20:21.171 --> 1:20:22.046
No.

1:20:24.629 --> 1:20:25.462
Igor.

1:20:30.129 --> 1:20:31.504
Good boy.

1:21:12.337 --> 1:21:13.837
Partner.

1:21:14.587 --> 1:21:15.587
Igor, I…

1:21:27.546 --> 1:21:29.096
The train's moving really fast.

1:21:30.212 --> 1:21:31.671
I'm lying on the roof.

1:21:32.962 --> 1:21:34.812
The blood is gushing out of my wound.

1:21:35.879 --> 1:21:38.045
The wind is blowing snow in my face.

1:21:38.129 --> 1:21:39.004
And I'm thinking:

1:21:39.504 --> 1:21:40.704
I should buy a neckband.

1:21:47.671 --> 1:21:48.771
We can't wake Lena up.

1:21:51.129 --> 1:21:51.962
Igor.

1:21:53.796 --> 1:21:55.846
Aren't you sick and tired of being alone?

1:21:59.671 --> 1:22:01.421
Why would I want anyone by my side?

1:22:02.671 --> 1:22:03.712
I feel great alone.

1:22:05.504 --> 1:22:08.046
You don't trust anyone, do you, Igor?

1:22:09.254 --> 1:22:10.753
I was exactly the same.

1:22:10.837 --> 1:22:12.212
I never trusted anyone.

1:22:12.296 --> 1:22:14.896
Why trust people?
They'll sell you out anyway, right?

1:22:19.087 --> 1:22:20.087
But then, Igor,

1:22:20.171 --> 1:22:21.296
I met your dad.

1:22:22.754 --> 1:22:23.753
And then I met Lena.

1:22:23.837 --> 1:22:26.462
My whole life turned upside down, got it?

1:22:27.171 --> 1:22:29.628
When you know that behind your back

1:22:29.712 --> 1:22:32.162
you've got your family,
your friend and your wife,

1:22:33.171 --> 1:22:35.253
you get a superpower.

1:22:35.337 --> 1:22:39.004
You can move heaven and earth.
The second wind kicks in.

1:22:41.379 --> 1:22:42.921
Don't push people away, Igor.

1:22:45.254 --> 1:22:46.504
They'll give you power.

1:23:07.004 --> 1:23:08.128
What do you want?

1:23:08.212 --> 1:23:10.962
-Hi Yulia.
-Wanna break my TV now? Do it.

1:23:15.337 --> 1:23:16.171
I…

1:23:16.712 --> 1:23:18.062
I mean I freaked out there.

1:23:19.546 --> 1:23:20.379
That's for you.

1:23:22.796 --> 1:23:24.421
It costs your monthly salary.

1:23:25.796 --> 1:23:28.337
Next month I'll buy you a laptop, promise.

1:23:28.879 --> 1:23:29.754
Take it.

1:23:31.004 --> 1:23:32.337
I have to go.

1:23:38.462 --> 1:23:41.171
Forgive me for everything I did.
I didn't mean it.

1:23:42.629 --> 1:23:43.462
Promise.

1:24:09.212 --> 1:24:10.879
Trainee.

1:24:18.337 --> 1:24:19.171
Ilya!

1:24:40.629 --> 1:24:42.087
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:24:43.129 --> 1:24:44.546
Good you called me, Igor.

1:24:45.212 --> 1:24:48.670
I am really worried about Lyosha.
He's been away for two days now.

1:24:48.754 --> 1:24:50.879
-I have a feeling that he…
-Yes, I know.

1:24:51.712 --> 1:24:53.796
Can I see his room?

1:24:56.337 --> 1:24:58.087
Sure. No problem.

1:24:58.171 --> 1:25:01.129
-It's a nice place.
-Yes, Sergey Razumovskiy helps us a lot.

1:25:01.712 --> 1:25:03.628
He sponsored the restoration
of the building.

1:25:03.712 --> 1:25:05.712
He donates money and gifts for the kids.

1:25:06.296 --> 1:25:07.670
He grew up in this children's home.

1:25:07.754 --> 1:25:08.954
This is why he helps us.

1:25:09.837 --> 1:25:11.004
God bless him.

1:25:11.587 --> 1:25:13.787
We kept some things
from his childhood years.

1:25:14.421 --> 1:25:15.879
Who is this man by his side?

1:25:16.546 --> 1:25:19.045
Oleg Volkov was his only friend.

1:25:19.129 --> 1:25:22.479
They became best friends right
after he came to the children's home.

1:25:24.254 --> 1:25:26.254
Later Sergey went to study in a college,

1:25:26.921 --> 1:25:28.504
and Oleg served in the army.

1:25:31.129 --> 1:25:33.421
-May I take a look?
-Yes, sure.

1:25:39.046 --> 1:25:41.046
Sergey was all alone before he met Oleg.

1:25:42.171 --> 1:25:43.629
He always played on his own.

1:25:44.921 --> 1:25:47.378
And he often made sketches
in his notebooks.

1:25:47.462 --> 1:25:49.421
He's got an artistic personality.

1:25:59.379 --> 1:26:00.837
He pursues his ultimate goal

1:26:00.921 --> 1:26:02.462
and kills for the sake of his ideals.

1:26:02.546 --> 1:26:04.096
Probably he was a lonely child.

1:26:04.754 --> 1:26:07.087
When I was a kid
I felt jealous about those…

1:26:07.171 --> 1:26:09.962
The Plague Doctor's channel
in the Vmeste social network…

1:26:10.046 --> 1:26:11.087
-Vmeste…
-Mission-oriented…

1:26:11.171 --> 1:26:12.253
God bless him.

1:26:12.337 --> 1:26:14.128
The man who did it is a real hero.

1:26:14.212 --> 1:26:15.670
Razumovskiy?

1:26:15.754 --> 1:26:16.837
He's not a hero.

1:26:16.921 --> 1:26:19.587
His contract with HOLT International says
a lot about the man.

1:26:19.671 --> 1:26:21.045
And Oleg served in the army.

1:26:21.129 --> 1:26:23.628
One of the largest weapon
manufacturers in the world.

1:26:23.712 --> 1:26:24.879
Vmeste…

1:26:28.462 --> 1:26:30.629
Thanks for finding some time for me.

1:26:34.212 --> 1:26:35.587
Sure, Igor.

1:26:35.671 --> 1:26:38.046
-You saved me out there.
-That was no big deal.

1:26:38.629 --> 1:26:40.587
-Are you okay if we drop the formalities?
-Sure.

1:26:40.671 --> 1:26:41.837
Come on in.

1:26:41.921 --> 1:26:43.379
Sorry about the mess.

1:26:44.629 --> 1:26:46.296
Do you really live here?

1:26:47.462 --> 1:26:48.296
Yep.

1:26:48.921 --> 1:26:52.253
I try to make the most of my time.

1:26:52.337 --> 1:26:53.787
Without losing it in traffic.

1:26:55.171 --> 1:26:56.071
How about a drink?

1:26:57.671 --> 1:26:59.371
No, thanks. I can't drink on duty.

1:27:00.671 --> 1:27:03.212
That's a cool place.
With all these sculptures…

1:27:05.712 --> 1:27:06.879
Venus is beautiful.

1:27:07.421 --> 1:27:08.971
The original painting, I guess?

1:27:09.837 --> 1:27:10.671
No, thanks.

1:27:14.504 --> 1:27:15.546
Tell me something.

1:27:16.087 --> 1:27:18.712
What is more expensive: all of this

1:27:19.962 --> 1:27:21.962
or a single outfit of the Plague Doctor?

1:27:25.671 --> 1:27:26.504
I don't know.

1:27:26.588 --> 1:27:27.713
Come on.

1:27:28.712 --> 1:27:31.128
That's your contract
with HOLT International.

1:27:31.212 --> 1:27:32.046
Take a look.

1:27:34.087 --> 1:27:36.087
The Description of Services says

1:27:36.171 --> 1:27:38.420
something about updating
office security systems.

1:27:38.504 --> 1:27:40.295
And I wondered.

1:27:40.379 --> 1:27:43.045
Why would a foreign manufacturer

1:27:43.129 --> 1:27:46.587
of the most advanced weapons install
alarm systems in your office?

1:27:46.671 --> 1:27:49.128
And here are the drawings
you made as a kid.

1:27:49.212 --> 1:27:50.046
Look at them.

1:27:55.046 --> 1:27:56.337
Rings a bell?

1:28:01.587 --> 1:28:03.295
And now tell me, scumbag,

1:28:03.379 --> 1:28:05.753
why you killed all those people.

1:28:05.837 --> 1:28:06.879
It was not me.

1:28:07.504 --> 1:28:09.154
Who did it then? I want the name.

1:28:11.587 --> 1:28:12.421
Oleg?

1:28:18.754 --> 1:28:19.837
Funny.

1:28:19.921 --> 1:28:23.296
First I thought the same.
That your friend Oleg Volkov did it.

1:28:25.087 --> 1:28:28.337
But then I found out
that he was killed in Syria last year.

1:28:32.254 --> 1:28:33.378
No more bullshit.

1:28:33.462 --> 1:28:36.337
Either you give me all the details…

1:28:36.421 --> 1:28:37.421
Look me in the eyes!

1:28:38.046 --> 1:28:39.962
…or I'll make you talk.

1:28:40.629 --> 1:28:41.829
What are you looking at?

1:28:53.379 --> 1:28:56.253
I didn't think you'll ever do it.

1:28:56.337 --> 1:28:57.962
-Oleg.
-Enough.

1:28:58.712 --> 1:29:00.671
Oleg is not here.

1:29:01.837 --> 1:29:03.337
And he has never been around.

1:29:04.087 --> 1:29:06.128
You know it perfectly well.

1:29:06.212 --> 1:29:09.295
It has always been me.

1:29:09.379 --> 1:29:12.879
All the time.

1:29:18.087 --> 1:29:18.921
Hi.

1:29:20.504 --> 1:29:21.379
What's your name?

1:29:22.087 --> 1:29:23.087
Seryozha.

1:29:24.671 --> 1:29:26.462
I'm Uncle Kostya.

1:29:29.837 --> 1:29:31.004
How old are you?

1:29:33.337 --> 1:29:34.879
-I'm eight.
-Wow.

1:29:36.879 --> 1:29:38.462
My son is a bit older than you.

1:29:40.629 --> 1:29:42.171
There was a fire nearby.

1:29:43.337 --> 1:29:44.879
Get out of here, dork.

1:29:45.421 --> 1:29:46.571
Three boys were killed.

1:29:48.462 --> 1:29:49.587
Did you see it?

1:29:58.921 --> 1:30:00.003
No.

1:30:00.087 --> 1:30:02.795
You were alone. That's why I came around.

1:30:02.879 --> 1:30:04.379
I've always been by your side.

1:30:05.087 --> 1:30:06.712
I protected you.

1:30:06.796 --> 1:30:09.396
We lived in perfect harmony, buddy.
What's wrong now?

1:30:10.796 --> 1:30:12.170
I see.

1:30:12.254 --> 1:30:14.004
You found a real friend.

1:30:14.546 --> 1:30:15.746
And you forgot about me.

1:30:16.462 --> 1:30:17.562
But I never went away.

1:30:18.962 --> 1:30:21.212
I always lived

1:30:21.296 --> 1:30:24.087
inside your head. Now,

1:30:24.171 --> 1:30:25.254
that Oleg is gone,

1:30:26.712 --> 1:30:27.879
I am back.

1:30:29.129 --> 1:30:30.837
Look at what we did together.

1:30:30.921 --> 1:30:32.295
You killed all those people.

1:30:32.379 --> 1:30:33.754
We killed them together.

1:30:34.546 --> 1:30:36.254
What's wrong about it?

1:30:37.504 --> 1:30:40.253
You wanted to make
the city a better place.

1:30:40.337 --> 1:30:41.487
But I'm not a murderer!

1:30:44.129 --> 1:30:46.837
You hated the kids who bullied you
in the orphanage,

1:30:46.921 --> 1:30:48.712
the bad guys who wanted
to grab your business,

1:30:48.796 --> 1:30:51.087
rich dudes who poison our city!

1:30:51.171 --> 1:30:53.128
I remember everyone who made you suffer.

1:30:53.212 --> 1:30:54.628
God is my witness,

1:30:54.712 --> 1:30:56.504
I was patient for far too long.

1:30:58.254 --> 1:30:59.712
Time has come.

1:30:59.796 --> 1:31:01.170
You're my creation.

1:31:01.254 --> 1:31:03.170
If I want it really bad,
you will disappear.

1:31:03.254 --> 1:31:06.379
Go away.

1:31:15.421 --> 1:31:17.962
That was a nice try.

1:31:18.879 --> 1:31:21.212
I'm not your imaginary companion.

1:31:21.296 --> 1:31:22.296
You see.

1:31:23.546 --> 1:31:26.754
I helped you kill the people before.

1:31:27.254 --> 1:31:28.129
But

1:31:30.046 --> 1:31:31.296
this time

1:31:38.296 --> 1:31:41.379
you did it yourself.

1:31:41.921 --> 1:31:43.921
That means something.

1:31:46.629 --> 1:31:49.254
We're becoming one.

1:31:57.546 --> 1:31:59.962
I'm gonna kill myself!
I'm gonna kill both of us!

1:32:00.046 --> 1:32:02.296
Don't even think about it, sucker.

1:32:03.129 --> 1:32:04.754
I'll never let you ruin my plan.

1:32:05.921 --> 1:32:07.087
You're gonna like it.

1:32:07.171 --> 1:32:09.671
You'll see it come true
with your own eyes!

1:33:16.046 --> 1:33:18.462
The Golden Dragon Casino.

1:33:19.629 --> 1:33:23.296
Yesterday they had a feast
in the time of plague there.

1:33:23.837 --> 1:33:28.004
Today it's ablaze with its owner inside.

1:33:29.212 --> 1:33:33.962
Albert Bekhtiev bartered away his native
city and worshiped the golden calf.

1:33:34.587 --> 1:33:37.046
He paid for it with his own life.

1:33:37.921 --> 1:33:40.920
The same fate awaits all the moneybags

1:33:41.004 --> 1:33:43.129
who dared to break the law.

1:34:01.879 --> 1:34:04.379
Oh shit…

1:34:21.671 --> 1:34:23.087
Surrender!

1:34:23.171 --> 1:34:25.504
Resistance is futile. You're surrounded.

1:34:28.212 --> 1:34:31.004
I repeat, resistance is futile.

1:34:37.837 --> 1:34:39.712
Come down here. Let's talk.

1:34:41.796 --> 1:34:42.629
Freeze!

1:35:01.212 --> 1:35:02.462
Keep your hands down!

1:35:16.296 --> 1:35:18.421
Yevgeniy Borisovich, we lost him.

1:36:00.921 --> 1:36:03.504
Central, I think I got the Plague Doctor.

1:36:06.587 --> 1:36:07.887
It's gonna blow Igor away.

1:36:11.671 --> 1:36:13.321
Razumovskiy is the Plague Doctor?

1:36:15.462 --> 1:36:18.128
-Yes.
-That's bullshit!

1:36:18.212 --> 1:36:21.629
You check out the evidence
I got against him!

1:36:23.671 --> 1:36:25.571
-You mean his childhood drawings?
-Yes.

1:36:26.796 --> 1:36:27.712
Darling.

1:36:27.796 --> 1:36:30.587
We got you in the act at the crime scene.

1:36:32.812 --> 1:36:37.103
Last night the criminal disguised
as Plague Doctor was arrested.

1:36:37.187 --> 1:36:39.387
His true identity has not been
disclosed yet.

1:36:59.271 --> 1:37:00.812
-Three o'clock?
-Clear.

1:37:00.896 --> 1:37:02.646
-Clear at Nine.
-Clear at Twelve.

1:37:45.812 --> 1:37:47.478
We won't let you do it!

1:37:47.562 --> 1:37:49.603
We'll never forgive!

1:37:49.687 --> 1:37:52.062
Free the Plague Doctor!

1:37:53.437 --> 1:37:56.312
Free the Plague Doctor!

1:37:56.396 --> 1:37:58.437
Free the Plague Doctor!

1:38:34.396 --> 1:38:35.312
I do judo.

1:39:01.729 --> 1:39:03.437
I'm not asking to help me. I…

1:39:03.979 --> 1:39:05.687
You have to understand. You promised.

1:39:05.771 --> 1:39:08.354
-I remember you said…
-Fyodor Ivanovich?

1:39:09.062 --> 1:39:10.395
I came to say goodbye.

1:39:10.479 --> 1:39:11.604
I got you. Yes sir.

1:39:12.479 --> 1:39:14.979
-I…
-Do you know what's going on out there?

1:39:30.437 --> 1:39:31.437
Your lawyer is here.

1:39:45.687 --> 1:39:47.537
When did you become a defense lawyer?

1:39:49.146 --> 1:39:50.696
You really wanna talk about it?

1:39:53.104 --> 1:39:53.954
What do you want?

1:39:54.604 --> 1:39:56.021
Another exclusive story?

1:39:57.604 --> 1:39:59.145
I wanna help you.

1:39:59.229 --> 1:40:00.854
I'm sure you were framed up.

1:40:01.896 --> 1:40:02.771
Why is that?

1:40:04.562 --> 1:40:08.112
They would've never caught the Plague
Doctor that easily. He's no idiot.

1:40:09.521 --> 1:40:10.521
Well…

1:40:11.979 --> 1:40:14.645
-I almost started to like you.
-Igor.

1:40:14.729 --> 1:40:17.728
Can you stop being a stubborn mule
for a second? Admit it.

1:40:17.812 --> 1:40:19.645
I'm your only hope.

1:40:19.729 --> 1:40:21.062
Tell me what happened.

1:40:21.146 --> 1:40:23.353
I'll make it public
and they'll let you go.

1:40:23.437 --> 1:40:24.937
I don't have that much time.

1:40:25.021 --> 1:40:27.021
I must get out of here now.

1:40:28.646 --> 1:40:30.396
First, I nail the Plague Doctor,

1:40:32.854 --> 1:40:34.104
then we'll talk.

1:40:43.646 --> 1:40:44.496
Whatever you say.

1:40:48.854 --> 1:40:50.354
Don't leave your trash behind.

1:40:56.729 --> 1:40:57.853
Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1:40:57.937 --> 1:40:59.978
-Igor is innocent.
-The judge will get to the truth.

1:41:00.062 --> 1:41:01.812
-But you said…
-Moscow calling.

1:41:01.896 --> 1:41:04.354
Dmitriy. You're starting to annoy me.

1:41:05.021 --> 1:41:07.853
-Did I make myself clear?
-Yevgeniy Borisovich, he couldn't do that.

1:41:07.937 --> 1:41:08.896
Hello?

1:41:09.896 --> 1:41:11.646
A hitman with a rat?

1:41:12.396 --> 1:41:14.596
-What is this bullshit?
-Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1:41:15.854 --> 1:41:17.271
-Okay.
-Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1:41:37.187 --> 1:41:38.771
True master never fades away.

1:41:47.896 --> 1:41:49.096
You've got five minutes.

1:41:50.229 --> 1:41:51.329
I want your taser too.

1:41:57.687 --> 1:41:59.229
How can you wear this shit?

1:42:05.479 --> 1:42:06.687
-Hey dude…
-Igor!

1:42:08.437 --> 1:42:09.587
What is she doing here?

1:42:10.562 --> 1:42:11.395
What do you mean?

1:42:11.479 --> 1:42:12.895
I thought you asked her to do that.

1:42:12.979 --> 1:42:15.478
Boys, can we talk about it on the way?

1:42:15.562 --> 1:42:17.478
We still have to get out of here

1:42:17.562 --> 1:42:19.312
and catch the Plague Doctor. Right?

1:42:28.729 --> 1:42:30.279
You're exiting Saint Petersburg

1:42:41.729 --> 1:42:43.062
Igor. What's this place?

1:42:43.562 --> 1:42:46.212
-Prokopenko's country house.
-Is he the Plague Doctor?

1:42:46.812 --> 1:42:47.771
What?

1:42:48.979 --> 1:42:51.929
No, you're going to stay put here
until I waste Razumovskiy.

1:42:58.187 --> 1:42:59.562
Razumovskiy?

1:43:00.521 --> 1:43:02.437
I knew he was involved.

1:43:02.521 --> 1:43:04.437
It's going to be sensational.

1:43:04.521 --> 1:43:06.771
-Igor, me must go together.
-No way.

1:43:07.646 --> 1:43:08.603
You'll stay here.

1:43:08.687 --> 1:43:09.562
I'll do it on my own.

1:43:09.646 --> 1:43:11.478
You got me out.
Your conscience is clear now.

1:43:11.562 --> 1:43:12.562
Good job.

1:43:13.437 --> 1:43:14.312
You got what you wanted?

1:43:14.396 --> 1:43:17.096
Now you know who the Plague Doctor is.
Go make a video.

1:43:25.812 --> 1:43:27.979
You know, Igor. I understood something.

1:43:28.896 --> 1:43:30.854
I'm not a pussy. I'm a hound.

1:43:33.229 --> 1:43:34.062
You are

1:43:35.271 --> 1:43:36.146
a hound too.

1:43:36.812 --> 1:43:39.104
And she's also a hound.

1:43:40.062 --> 1:43:42.521
We must stay together.

1:43:43.146 --> 1:43:45.729
Because we are a damn pack!

1:43:51.771 --> 1:43:54.021
I am afraid to trust a wrong person.

1:43:59.687 --> 1:44:01.637
But friends in need are friends indeed.

1:44:05.937 --> 1:44:08.387
Take the torch.
Go grab a gun in the storage room.

1:44:16.604 --> 1:44:18.770
Igor, there's nothing except jars here.

1:44:18.854 --> 1:44:19.729
Sorry, man.

1:44:23.562 --> 1:44:26.312
Open the door, Igor.
It's not funny, you hear me?

1:44:26.396 --> 1:44:28.021
I can't believe he fell for it.

1:44:28.604 --> 1:44:30.146
You'll stay in charge.

1:44:30.812 --> 1:44:33.662
You open the door in a couple of hours
when he calms down.

1:44:35.479 --> 1:44:36.312
Igor!

1:44:36.396 --> 1:44:38.437
Hide the car. They'll be looking for it.

1:44:40.521 --> 1:44:41.479
Damn.

1:44:53.437 --> 1:44:54.979
Your father?

1:45:00.812 --> 1:45:01.712
Two peas in a pod.

1:45:07.479 --> 1:45:08.312
Igor.

1:45:12.271 --> 1:45:14.146
Wait. You have any kind of a plan?

1:45:17.521 --> 1:45:18.437
Sure.

1:45:21.187 --> 1:45:22.062
What?

1:45:27.979 --> 1:45:28.854
Good luck.

1:46:05.729 --> 1:46:07.829
Stop right there before I call the police.

1:46:09.187 --> 1:46:10.020
I'm kidding.

1:46:10.104 --> 1:46:12.062
Hello, Igor. Please come in.

1:46:18.937 --> 1:46:20.437
Greetings, Igor.

1:46:21.562 --> 1:46:23.812
I didn't think
you would get out that quickly.

1:46:26.437 --> 1:46:27.271
Nevertheless,

1:46:28.146 --> 1:46:30.103
you can never stop me

1:46:30.187 --> 1:46:31.728
from saving the city.

1:46:31.812 --> 1:46:34.770
I gave money back to the clients
Isayeva cheated in her bank.

1:46:34.854 --> 1:46:36.437
I bought Zilchenko's dump site,

1:46:36.521 --> 1:46:38.812
and I'll clear out the city.

1:46:38.896 --> 1:46:41.604
Grechkin and Bekhtiev,
they died for a reason.

1:46:42.271 --> 1:46:44.312
Without them I can build a new

1:46:46.312 --> 1:46:48.021
perfect city.

1:46:49.979 --> 1:46:51.562
No one can stand in my way.

1:46:53.646 --> 1:46:54.687
Even you.

1:46:54.771 --> 1:46:55.646
You sure?

1:47:23.437 --> 1:47:25.021
Nice try.

1:47:26.271 --> 1:47:28.312
Margo, stream the video.

1:47:28.396 --> 1:47:30.104
Yes, Sergey. You're on.

1:47:32.229 --> 1:47:36.437
You're watching this video,
and that means I got busted.

1:47:37.437 --> 1:47:38.437
But that doesn't mean

1:47:38.521 --> 1:47:39.979
that it's all over.

1:47:41.354 --> 1:47:43.103
I call on all the people

1:47:43.187 --> 1:47:45.437
who believe in fair trials.

1:47:46.437 --> 1:47:49.728
You know those who poison our city

1:47:49.812 --> 1:47:51.479
and you know how they do it.

1:47:52.146 --> 1:47:54.062
I give you their names and addresses.

1:47:54.146 --> 1:47:55.146
You know what to do.

1:47:56.146 --> 1:47:59.854
You can stop them.

1:48:00.687 --> 1:48:03.437
These morons will try to escape.

1:48:03.521 --> 1:48:06.395
Don't let them do that.

1:48:06.479 --> 1:48:07.937
I'm going to help you.

1:48:08.021 --> 1:48:09.103
We're going back.

1:48:09.187 --> 1:48:12.812
I've got another joker up my sleeve.

1:48:12.896 --> 1:48:15.312
I'd rather die a free man

1:48:15.396 --> 1:48:18.562
than spend the rest of my life in jail.

1:48:18.646 --> 1:48:21.853
And I'll take to my grave corrupt pigs

1:48:21.937 --> 1:48:24.437
who run errands for scumbags.

1:48:32.437 --> 1:48:34.770
The police can't stop you.

1:48:34.854 --> 1:48:37.520
You finish what I started.

1:48:37.604 --> 1:48:40.646
Now each of you is the Plague Doctor.

1:48:51.354 --> 1:48:52.687
What did you do?

1:48:52.771 --> 1:48:53.687
Relax, Igor.

1:48:54.604 --> 1:48:56.603
Everything's going on as planned.

1:48:56.687 --> 1:49:00.437
The human trash will go out to the streets
because they're sure

1:49:01.187 --> 1:49:02.312
of their impunity.

1:49:06.562 --> 1:49:09.395
The military will come in the city
in a couple of hours

1:49:09.479 --> 1:49:11.396
to clear it out

1:49:12.771 --> 1:49:13.979
once and for all.

1:49:15.104 --> 1:49:17.145
I'll get rid of the moneybags

1:49:17.229 --> 1:49:18.562
who poison the city

1:49:18.646 --> 1:49:20.562
and the scum of the earth who mimic me.

1:49:20.646 --> 1:49:23.228
You know how many people were killed?

1:49:23.312 --> 1:49:25.187
How many more are going to die?

1:49:25.271 --> 1:49:26.354
Does it matter?

1:49:27.229 --> 1:49:28.937
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

1:50:31.062 --> 1:50:32.687
Look at this braveheart!

1:50:32.771 --> 1:50:33.729
Come on!

1:50:34.604 --> 1:50:37.687
Get him!

1:50:45.229 --> 1:50:47.562
One, two - we'll find you too
Three, four - you're at death's door

1:50:47.646 --> 1:50:49.145
The High And Mighty Who's Next?

1:50:49.229 --> 1:50:51.145
Five, six - we'll burn you, pricks

1:50:51.229 --> 1:50:52.929
Seven, eight - you'll shit bricks.

1:51:08.687 --> 1:51:11.562
When the justice system is
utterly corrupted

1:51:12.562 --> 1:51:15.396
When crinkling and crackling bills can
change any law

1:51:16.562 --> 1:51:19.771
Stones, clubs and knives come from nowhere

1:51:20.437 --> 1:51:22.729
Into the hands of duped fools

1:51:24.229 --> 1:51:26.854
Justice comes in with smashed shop windows

1:51:28.354 --> 1:51:30.520
Midnight streetlamps ooze panic

1:51:30.604 --> 1:51:32.187
The Judge. 26, Fontanka Embankment

1:51:32.271 --> 1:51:34.771
Wild crowd stands united

1:51:36.354 --> 1:51:39.562
With a never-ending cry
'Let it all burn to hell!'

1:51:43.146 --> 1:51:45.729
I'll give you everything.

1:51:50.396 --> 1:51:52.021
Here… You can take it.

1:52:04.104 --> 1:52:05.937
Grandpa, who is he?

1:52:29.396 --> 1:52:30.354
Igor.

1:52:32.396 --> 1:52:33.646
You don't stand a chance.

1:52:40.229 --> 1:52:41.604
Goddamnit!

1:52:44.146 --> 1:52:45.937
You can't hide in here.

1:53:20.854 --> 1:53:22.812
Igor, the city wants me!

1:53:22.896 --> 1:53:25.520
I've got money, technologies,
and the power!

1:53:25.604 --> 1:53:26.687
What do you have?

1:53:28.729 --> 1:53:29.937
He's got friends.

1:53:39.104 --> 1:53:41.021
Are you okay? You okay?

1:53:42.021 --> 1:53:43.221
What are you doing here?

1:53:44.854 --> 1:53:46.312
What are you doing here?

1:53:48.354 --> 1:53:50.770
Take cover! Now!

1:53:50.854 --> 1:53:51.979
Get out of here!

1:54:55.521 --> 1:54:56.896
Think!

1:55:11.729 --> 1:55:12.771
Think!

1:55:28.354 --> 1:55:29.396
Think!

1:55:47.479 --> 1:55:48.629
Nothing to think about.

1:56:41.804 --> 1:56:44.095
What's this pathetic rumble about?

1:56:44.179 --> 1:56:46.762
We hate this kind of mess on our block.

1:56:49.179 --> 1:56:51.012
Get them!!!

1:57:03.221 --> 1:57:04.221
Sunny…

1:57:05.471 --> 1:57:06.804
Alive!

1:57:08.387 --> 1:57:09.387
Fyodor Ivanovich.

1:57:46.929 --> 1:57:49.220
Come on! Come on!

1:57:49.304 --> 1:57:50.971
Go! Go!

1:58:08.929 --> 1:58:10.304
You saved my life.

1:58:11.887 --> 1:58:13.220
Twice.

1:58:13.304 --> 1:58:14.137
Right.

1:58:15.096 --> 1:58:16.553
Friends in need are friends indeed.

1:58:16.637 --> 1:58:17.637
You know.

1:58:20.679 --> 1:58:21.887
I was wrong.

1:58:23.137 --> 1:58:24.262
I'd never have done it

1:58:25.596 --> 1:58:26.554
without you.

1:58:29.471 --> 1:58:30.512
Partner.

1:58:35.471 --> 1:58:37.929
Wanna kiss each other?

1:58:38.846 --> 1:58:40.845
Hey, bad boy.

1:58:40.929 --> 1:58:42.137
Why are you so happy?

1:58:43.346 --> 1:58:45.296
You'll serve a life sentence in prison.

1:58:46.512 --> 1:58:48.554
Really? You don't get it?

1:58:50.637 --> 1:58:53.087
Cops are sure
that you're the Plague Doctor, Igor.

1:58:54.887 --> 1:58:55.887
Think about it.

1:58:56.804 --> 1:58:58.678
You escaped from the police station.

1:58:58.762 --> 1:59:00.595
You're behind the bomb attack

1:59:00.679 --> 1:59:02.262
and the mass riots.

1:59:04.179 --> 1:59:07.229
And then you attacked the one and the only
Sergey Razumovskiy.

1:59:08.304 --> 1:59:10.204
You put on this stupid costume on him.

1:59:10.971 --> 1:59:12.845
I'll walk free,

1:59:12.929 --> 1:59:14.887
and you'll get a life sentence.

1:59:14.971 --> 1:59:16.021
Together with your…

1:59:17.721 --> 1:59:18.762
…friends.

1:59:28.387 --> 1:59:29.262
Look over there.

1:59:37.304 --> 1:59:38.846
Think!

1:59:40.012 --> 1:59:42.928
You know how many people were killed?

1:59:43.012 --> 1:59:44.562
How many more are going to die?

1:59:45.554 --> 1:59:46.762
Does it matter?

1:59:47.512 --> 1:59:49.387
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

1:59:50.596 --> 1:59:54.178
You know, I already made a video
on the true identity of the Plague Doctor.

1:59:54.262 --> 1:59:56.929
That was a cherry on top.

1:59:57.596 --> 1:59:58.429
Thanks.

1:59:59.887 --> 2:00:01.137
Wanna add anything?

2:00:15.596 --> 2:00:17.446
And what did you get out of it, Igor?

2:00:19.512 --> 2:00:20.912
You're back on track, right?

2:00:22.929 --> 2:00:23.971
Good job.

2:00:25.221 --> 2:00:26.871
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

2:00:28.887 --> 2:00:30.054
A stupid cop?

2:00:30.846 --> 2:00:32.512
Who doesn't understand a thing?

2:00:32.596 --> 2:00:34.196
You're a watchdog of the regime.

2:00:35.054 --> 2:00:36.654
I see what's going on every day.

2:00:38.971 --> 2:00:40.012
In the streets.

2:00:41.012 --> 2:00:42.862
Not from the top floor of your tower.

2:00:44.804 --> 2:00:47.679
Injustice, lawlessness and stuff.

2:00:48.387 --> 2:00:51.087
You think you're the only one
who wants to help people?

2:00:52.096 --> 2:00:53.346
Did you read Dostoevsky?

2:00:56.096 --> 2:00:57.512
You can't kill people.

2:00:58.721 --> 2:01:00.720
Even the worst people.

2:01:00.804 --> 2:01:02.803
Or else the world will go crazy.

2:01:02.887 --> 2:01:03.762
Like you did.

2:01:06.096 --> 2:01:09.346
I was this city's only hope.

2:01:18.971 --> 2:01:21.262
The city can survive without you.

2:01:34.012 --> 2:01:35.062
It took them forever.

2:01:41.179 --> 2:01:42.887
Fyodor Ivanovich, I thought…

2:01:42.971 --> 2:01:44.471
-I thought you…
-Easy, easy.

2:01:45.512 --> 2:01:48.678
It's okay. I'm fine.

2:01:48.762 --> 2:01:50.637
Don't even dream about it.

2:01:53.346 --> 2:01:54.971
Hello, my little friend.

2:01:56.387 --> 2:01:57.304
Do it.

2:02:00.471 --> 2:02:01.970
Did you do it alone again?

2:02:02.054 --> 2:02:03.096
Fyodor Ivanovich.

2:02:05.346 --> 2:02:06.595
My friends helped me.

2:02:06.679 --> 2:02:09.029
What's the reason for the party?
I don't get it.

2:02:12.596 --> 2:02:13.637
Don't.

2:02:14.387 --> 2:02:15.346
Well, general, sir?

2:02:16.096 --> 2:02:18.746
We're gonna have a nice talk soon.
About your pension.

2:02:19.721 --> 2:02:20.929
And you, lovebirds,

2:02:21.887 --> 2:02:24.887
you'll go make mittens
in a Siberian labor camp.

2:02:31.137 --> 2:02:32.471
Any questions?

2:02:33.512 --> 2:02:36.220
-Let's get back to work, dudes.
-Yes sir.

2:02:36.304 --> 2:02:37.720
-Get back to work.
-Hello.

2:02:37.804 --> 2:02:39.262
-My name is Yulia Pchyolkina.
-Okay.

2:02:39.346 --> 2:02:41.095
Nice to meet you.
Can I take a picture of you?

2:02:41.179 --> 2:02:43.054
-Yes, sure.
-Come closer, please.

2:02:44.054 --> 2:02:46.346
Dubin. Let's take a picture.

2:02:48.387 --> 2:02:50.137
Don't say a word. Just smile.

2:02:53.262 --> 2:02:54.096
Thank you.

2:02:54.929 --> 2:02:55.971
You're welcome.

2:02:57.387 --> 2:02:58.387
Why?

2:02:59.679 --> 2:03:01.053
Why didn't I see her before?

2:03:01.137 --> 2:03:02.720
Well…

2:03:02.804 --> 2:03:05.512
What's that?
You invite her to a dinner at my place.

2:03:05.596 --> 2:03:07.804
-No way…
-You heard me.

2:03:10.804 --> 2:03:12.428
That's my leather jacket.

2:03:12.512 --> 2:03:14.096
Fyodor Ivanovich, I…

2:03:17.262 --> 2:03:19.221
And that's my bike.

2:03:20.346 --> 2:03:22.304
Mine.

2:03:24.179 --> 2:03:25.346
Igor…

2:03:26.012 --> 2:03:26.846
It's…

2:03:27.804 --> 2:03:28.887
…mine.

2:03:32.346 --> 2:03:33.596
Easy, scumbags!

2:03:34.304 --> 2:03:35.595
Easy!

2:03:35.679 --> 2:03:38.220
I peeped out of the window
and saw a showdown.

2:03:38.304 --> 2:03:41.137
I belled the dudes. We're the gang.

2:03:41.221 --> 2:03:42.845
We went out to see what's going on.
I went like…

2:03:42.929 --> 2:03:44.887
Got it? That's what I did.

2:03:44.971 --> 2:03:46.887
And then the fuzz came in the game.

2:03:46.971 --> 2:03:49.720
Sensational developments
in the case of the Plague Doctor.

2:03:49.804 --> 2:03:52.220
He was identified as Sergey Razumovskiy,

2:03:52.304 --> 2:03:54.095
the founder of Vmeste social network.

2:03:54.179 --> 2:03:57.053
Yevgeniy Strelkov
who personally arrested the criminal

2:03:57.137 --> 2:04:00.179
promised to do his best
to expedite the legal proceedings.

2:04:01.346 --> 2:04:03.887
When the true intentions
of the Plague Doctor were made public,

2:04:03.971 --> 2:04:06.053
his popularity immediately waned.

2:04:06.137 --> 2:04:10.262
Today the authorities announced the launch
of a large-scale judicial reform.

2:04:10.346 --> 2:04:13.845
The mere fact of the extremely active
public response to these events

2:04:13.929 --> 2:04:17.971
confirms the urgency
and demand for changes.

2:04:24.096 --> 2:04:25.012
Thanks.

2:04:25.887 --> 2:04:26.721
Wow!

2:04:27.346 --> 2:04:28.512
Awesome!

2:04:29.221 --> 2:04:31.346
Igor, how did you find this place?

2:04:32.179 --> 2:04:34.012
I was here a couple of days ago.

2:04:37.429 --> 2:04:40.471
Yulia, will you stop binge watching
your own videos?

2:04:40.971 --> 2:04:43.053
We kinda came here
to spend some time together.

2:04:43.137 --> 2:04:44.096
Major Grom…

2:04:46.137 --> 2:04:48.095
Did you see how many likes we got?

2:04:48.179 --> 2:04:49.470
-I did.
-Here you are.

2:04:49.554 --> 2:04:51.596
I dunno. The title sounds too pompous.

2:04:52.262 --> 2:04:53.804
I'm no superhero.

2:04:55.221 --> 2:04:56.429
I can't fly

2:04:57.179 --> 2:04:58.679
or shoot laser from my eyes.

2:05:00.179 --> 2:05:01.928
I don't have this thing either.

2:05:02.012 --> 2:05:06.137
A superhero isn't a man with superpowers.
He's the man who defeated super villains.

2:05:07.179 --> 2:05:08.054
How about that?

2:05:09.679 --> 2:05:11.803
-Right?
-That's the best line in your video.

2:05:11.887 --> 2:05:13.887
-You got it?
-Try it before it gets cold.

2:05:25.096 --> 2:05:26.096
What d'you say?

2:05:32.429 --> 2:05:33.637
It's delicious.

2:05:35.054 --> 2:05:36.762
They stuff fresh meat in it.

2:05:36.846 --> 2:05:38.696
The cat was still alive this morning.

2:05:45.721 --> 2:05:47.345
Come on. What's wrong with you?

2:05:47.429 --> 2:05:48.762
With me?

2:06:03.679 --> 2:06:04.554
Shit.

2:06:06.887 --> 2:06:08.387
No more blank pages.

2:06:11.054 --> 2:06:12.204
Can you hold it for me?

2:06:13.512 --> 2:06:15.862
-Let me take a look.
-No, it's for my eyes only.

2:06:18.221 --> 2:06:20.428
Yulia, that's your portrait.

2:06:20.512 --> 2:06:22.928
-Igor, that's not funny.
-What?

2:06:23.012 --> 2:06:24.928
-It is!
-Yulia, don't look!

2:06:25.012 --> 2:06:27.512
-Take it easy! Come on!
-Igor, I'm not kidding!

2:06:27.596 --> 2:06:30.262
-Igor, leave him alone.
-If you say so.

2:06:31.137 --> 2:06:32.137
That's okay.

2:09:05.387 --> 2:09:06.929
Do you want to sedate him?

2:09:08.221 --> 2:09:09.721
No need, Sofia.

2:09:12.887 --> 2:09:15.971
He's a very unusual case.

2:09:20.054 --> 2:09:21.596
A very interesting one.

2:09:25.096 --> 2:09:27.012
Don't worry.

2:09:27.554 --> 2:09:30.512
We'll get out of here soon.

2:09:31.679 --> 2:09:32.846
And then…
