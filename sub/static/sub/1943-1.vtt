05:08.232 --> 05:10.893
Take a sample of her blood...

05:11.335 --> 05:14.203
...and then get rid of that.
- Yes, sir.

07:02.313 --> 07:05.544
<i>The Umbrella Corporation thought</i>
<i>they'd contained the infection.</i>

07:05.750 --> 07:07.012
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

07:07.218 --> 07:09.186
<i>Raccoon City was just the beginning.</i>

07:09.387 --> 07:13.118
<i>Within weeks, the T-virus</i>
<i>had consumed the United States.</i>

07:13.324 --> 07:15.292
<i>Within months, the world.</i>

07:15.493 --> 07:17.757
<i>The virus didn't just</i>
<i>wipe out human life.</i>

07:17.962 --> 07:20.931
<i>Lakes and rivers dried up,</i>
<i>forests became deserts...</i>

07:21.132 --> 07:23.032
<i>... and whole continents</i>
<i>were reduced to...</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:25.566
<i>... nothing more than</i>
<i>barren wastelands.</i>

07:25.770 --> 07:30.833
<i>Slowly but surely, the Earth</i>
<i>began to wither and die.</i>

07:43.754 --> 07:46.882
<i>What few survivors there were</i>
<i>learned to keep on the move.</i>

07:47.091 --> 07:48.752
<i>We avoided major cities.</i>

07:48.960 --> 07:52.657
<i>If we stopped anyplace too long,</i>
<i>they would be drawn to us.</i>

07:52.864 --> 07:56.356
<i>Only a few at first,</i>
<i>but then more and more.</i>

07:56.567 --> 08:00.264
<i>A never-ending army of undead.</i>

08:00.471 --> 08:02.462
<i>For those of us left...</i>

08:02.673 --> 08:04.504
<i>... staying on the road...</i>

08:04.709 --> 08:06.870
<i>... seemed the only way to stay alive.</i>

08:18.990 --> 08:21.720
<i>This is KLKB.</i>
<i>We have seven people here...</i>

08:21.926 --> 08:23.894
<i>... in need of urgent medical attention.</i>

08:24.095 --> 08:27.553
<i>We need help. This is KLKB.</i>
<i>Can anyone hear us?</i>

08:27.765 --> 08:30.325
<i>Can anyone help us? Please?</i>

09:38.936 --> 09:40.096
My baby.

09:41.639 --> 09:43.129
Please.

09:43.341 --> 09:44.774
Please help my baby.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.449
You bitch.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.628
You dropped my baby.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.465
"We're surrounded. We need help.
Can anyone hear us?

10:10.668 --> 10:14.661
- Can anyone help us? Please."
- Works every time, Mama.

10:14.872 --> 10:16.863
Let's see...

10:17.575 --> 10:19.941
...what else she's packing.
- Yeah.

10:23.381 --> 10:24.973
What you got down there, fishy?

10:26.350 --> 10:27.942
I wouldn't do that.

10:30.821 --> 10:31.947
Shut your mouth!

10:32.356 --> 10:34.551
- Relax!
- Just show the bitch.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.896
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

10:43.701 --> 10:45.396
Jesus Christ! He's dead!

11:08.626 --> 11:10.491
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

11:10.695 --> 11:12.185
Well, you'll see.

11:13.330 --> 11:16.731
There you go, bitch.
I wouldn't want it to be over too fast!

11:28.512 --> 11:30.537
Open the cage!

11:57.141 --> 11:58.199
Let them loose.

13:04.441 --> 13:05.840
Get up now!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.185
That was a juicy one, huh?

14:51.282 --> 14:52.943
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.

14:53.150 --> 14:55.448
- You got any smokes?
- <i>No.</i>

14:55.653 --> 14:57.450
Like I'm supposed to believe that.

14:58.756 --> 15:00.656
Claire, would I lie to you?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.896
- <i>L.J.</i>
- Claire Redfield, how can I help you?

15:12.469 --> 15:14.960
- Got any smokes?
- <i>No can do.</i>

15:16.073 --> 15:17.267
How about alternate?

15:17.474 --> 15:20.375
Sorry to say we're out of that too.

15:20.577 --> 15:22.670
You gotta be shitting me. Otto?

15:23.080 --> 15:26.777
Sorry, campers. Smoked the last of it
back in Salt Lake.

15:26.984 --> 15:28.076
Damn.

15:28.285 --> 15:29.912
- <i>Yeah, people...</i>
- Damn it.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.917
<i>... it really is the end of the world.</i>

16:05.422 --> 16:07.549
- Anyone else?
- Paris facility.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.249
Food supplies down to 50 percent.

16:10.461 --> 16:14.329
Six casualties.
Biohazard numbers increasing.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.630
London facility.

16:16.834 --> 16:20.270
Food supplies down to 28 percent.
Seventeen casualties.

16:20.471 --> 16:22.837
Biohazard numbers increasing.

16:23.474 --> 16:24.498
Gentlemen.

16:25.342 --> 16:26.400
Dr. Isaacs.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.935
How good of the science division
to join us.

16:29.146 --> 16:31.979
Chairman Wesker. I've been busy.

16:32.182 --> 16:35.879
On the subject of the biohazard,
what is the science division's report?

16:36.854 --> 16:40.915
Well, we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance.

16:41.592 --> 16:45.323
They hunger for flesh
but do not require it.

16:45.529 --> 16:49.090
My research indicates
they could remain active for decades.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.760
We're to be trapped underground
for decades?

16:52.970 --> 16:55.302
What news of Project Alice?

16:55.506 --> 16:57.940
Using antibodies from her blood...

16:58.142 --> 17:02.943
...I will develop a serum that will not
just combat the effects of the T-virus...

17:03.147 --> 17:05.637
...but potentially reverse it...

17:05.848 --> 17:09.079
...giving back these creatures
a measure of their intelligence...

17:09.286 --> 17:14.383
...their memories,
thus curbing their hunger for flesh.

17:14.590 --> 17:17.025
You're confident you can
domesticate them?

17:18.262 --> 17:21.060
They're animals, essentially.

17:21.265 --> 17:26.167
We can train them, if we can
take away their baser instincts.

17:26.904 --> 17:28.132
They'll never be human...

17:28.338 --> 17:32.069
...but would provide the basis
for a docile workforce.

17:32.509 --> 17:33.806
We can return to the surface.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.479
After months of experiments,
you have nothing to show.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.945
- We are left to rot underground.
- Without the original Project Alice...

17:40.150 --> 17:41.674
...progress has been difficult.

17:41.885 --> 17:44.877
I've been forced to replicate her
using cloned genetic models.

17:45.089 --> 17:48.252
It's laborious.
The results, unpredictable.

17:48.459 --> 17:53.158
Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest priority.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.489
You will concentrate on this to
the exclusion of all other research.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.464
We expect an updated report
in a week.

17:59.670 --> 18:02.969
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

18:03.173 --> 18:05.641
Then perhaps we should place
someone else in charge.

18:05.843 --> 18:09.176
Someone who can give us
the reassurances we require.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.177
Continue with your research, doctor...

18:12.382 --> 18:15.545
...while it still is your research.

18:15.752 --> 18:17.777
This meeting is adjourned.

18:32.169 --> 18:34.694
Sorry about this, Stevie.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.632
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,</i>
<i>broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

20:19.843 --> 20:21.572
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

20:23.213 --> 20:26.512
<i>Broadcasting for any survivors.</i>
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

20:30.821 --> 20:33.984
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,</i>
<i>broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

20:34.191 --> 20:35.715
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

21:41.458 --> 21:45.121
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

21:45.362 --> 21:48.422
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

21:49.700 --> 21:52.726
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.563
Keep trying, Mikey.

21:55.706 --> 21:57.298
Is there anyone alive in there?

21:58.141 --> 21:59.836
<i>Please respond.</i>

22:00.043 --> 22:02.637
- Seems quiet.
- Yeah, don't they always?

22:02.913 --> 22:05.507
<i>Is there anyone alive in there?</i>
<i>Please respond.</i>

22:05.716 --> 22:08.776
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in?

22:08.985 --> 22:11.044
It's your call, boys.

22:12.222 --> 22:15.419
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

22:51.862 --> 22:53.625
I'm gonna get me a room.

22:53.830 --> 22:57.357
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi...

22:57.567 --> 22:59.694
...and I'm gonna rent me a porno.

25:08.899 --> 25:10.594
<i>What happened? You two okay?</i>

25:11.768 --> 25:13.258
Yeah. It's all clear.

25:25.181 --> 25:26.773
Somebody need my help?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.681
It's nothing. But if you insist...

25:30.887 --> 25:33.447
That's right. So sit back and relax.

25:36.293 --> 25:40.787
Spread out. Look for anything of use.
Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.295
You like playing rough, huh?

25:43.500 --> 25:46.230
- Oh, I've had worse.
- I'm sure.

25:46.937 --> 25:49.462
But you've always been gentle
with me, Betty.

25:49.906 --> 25:53.342
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.606
So, what do we say,
dinner at my place tonight?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.245
Oh, I'm there.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.577
Hey, Betty! Over here!

26:50.767 --> 26:53.361
This is amazing.
He knows what it is.

26:58.642 --> 27:00.234
Camera.

27:01.811 --> 27:03.005
You try.

27:10.687 --> 27:12.587
Stand your ground.

27:13.990 --> 27:16.720
- My God.
- Unbelievable.

27:35.545 --> 27:37.206
He has memory
and reasoning skills.

27:37.414 --> 27:41.475
This is incredible. The serum works.
You've domesticated them.

27:41.685 --> 27:44.210
You've done it. Congratulations.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.060
No, doctor! Please. No!

27:55.732 --> 27:57.859
No, no, doctor. Please, no!

28:12.716 --> 28:15.685
Pork and beans. I'll get some
peaches for the little one there.

28:15.885 --> 28:17.147
There you go.

28:17.353 --> 28:19.947
- It's asparagus.
- Thanks.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.453
For you...

28:21.658 --> 28:23.091
...cat food.

28:25.295 --> 28:27.525
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.

28:28.531 --> 28:30.897
- Hey.
- What's this, huh?

28:31.101 --> 28:33.296
- Soup. Cream of mushroom.
- Bullshit.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.165
- I think that's pork and beans too.
- Thanks, man.

28:36.706 --> 28:38.139
- I'll be damned.
- Asparagus.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.400
- How do you do that?
- Just one of my skills.

28:40.643 --> 28:43.510
It's a dying art, unfortunately.

28:43.713 --> 28:45.613
This is the last of it.

28:45.815 --> 28:48.613
- I think it's some kind of fruit.
- Thanks, Otto.

28:49.085 --> 28:50.950
Sorry, that's all we have.

28:51.154 --> 28:53.418
Fruit. You want some fruit?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.586
Fruit. You want some fruit?

29:03.800 --> 29:07.167
- Did you check out the gas station?
- Yep, it's bone-dry.

29:09.005 --> 29:10.597
Well, how we looking here?

29:11.307 --> 29:14.504
Well, Claire, if we can run
these trucks on rust...

29:14.944 --> 29:16.502
...we're looking pretty good.

29:17.247 --> 29:18.236
All right.

29:23.153 --> 29:24.711
Hey, sweetheart.

29:24.921 --> 29:26.252
Perimeter up yet?

29:26.456 --> 29:28.424
It's almost done.

29:29.526 --> 29:31.289
- Who's out there?
- Olivera.

29:34.364 --> 29:36.628
- <i>Hey, Carlos.</i>
- Claire.

29:36.833 --> 29:40.030
<i>All that smoking is slowing you down.</i>
<i>Get your ass in gear, old man.</i>

29:40.970 --> 29:42.528
I want my perimeter up.

29:58.054 --> 30:00.420
Last sentinel in place.

30:00.623 --> 30:05.151
Perimeter's up and running.
All motion sensors online.

30:06.162 --> 30:07.686
Cameras 100 percent.

30:12.569 --> 30:14.799
Refried beans. Fruit salad.

30:15.004 --> 30:16.733
Oh, my favorite.

30:17.874 --> 30:19.239
Storm's coming!

30:19.442 --> 30:22.502
Let's start packing it up
and move it inside.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.342
- Come on, kids, let's go!
- Hurry up!

30:25.548 --> 30:28.483
Get back in the bus.
Put this fire out.

31:04.754 --> 31:08.212
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.693
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.</i>
<i>Calling any survivors.</i>

31:14.831 --> 31:18.699
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy.</i>
<i>Location, the Desert Trail Motel.</i>

31:18.935 --> 31:22.701
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.</i>
<i>Calling any survivors.</i>

32:28.871 --> 32:30.839
Activate Number 87.

33:53.589 --> 33:54.886
Shit.

33:55.091 --> 33:57.025
- Dr. Isaacs.
- What is it?

33:57.226 --> 33:59.990
My sensors have detected a peak
in psionic activity.

34:00.229 --> 34:02.220
Both alpha and beta wave.

34:02.432 --> 34:03.797
From Number 87?

34:04.033 --> 34:06.365
No, the activity's not from
one of the clones.

34:06.569 --> 34:09.094
It occurred outside the complex.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.136
- That's not possible.
- My sensors were quite clear.

34:13.342 --> 34:17.938
Massive psionic activity was detected
15 minutes ago...

34:18.147 --> 34:20.809
...centered on a desert location.

36:05.388 --> 36:07.720
- Claire!
- What?

36:30.580 --> 36:32.047
What the hell?

36:33.182 --> 36:34.774
Oh, God.

36:43.392 --> 36:46.589
- Carlos.
- I see them.

36:48.564 --> 36:50.759
Everybody stay in your trucks.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.897
What's going on?

36:54.403 --> 36:56.530
<i>Everyone just stay in your trucks.</i>

36:56.739 --> 36:59.105
Roll up the windows and keep quiet.

36:59.609 --> 37:01.236
Okay, close the windows up.

37:20.496 --> 37:22.464
What's wrong with their eyes?

37:23.866 --> 37:26.426
They've been feeding
on infected flesh.

37:44.954 --> 37:47.821
- Fire it up. Let's get out of here.
- That's a hell of an idea.

37:48.024 --> 37:49.514
Lock and load.

37:55.031 --> 37:58.091
- We're stuck!
- Hell, no, let's get out of here.

38:02.538 --> 38:04.802
Let's head for the bus, come on.

38:10.379 --> 38:13.143
Come on! Go! Go!

38:13.349 --> 38:15.544
Come on, get in!
Come on, come on, come on.

38:27.897 --> 38:29.330
Claire!

38:31.233 --> 38:32.666
Damn it.

38:32.902 --> 38:34.961
Mikey, Carlos,
we have to evac the bus.

38:36.172 --> 38:37.730
You got it.

38:40.376 --> 38:41.741
Hold it!

39:02.798 --> 39:05.096
- Come on, move!
- Keep moving!

39:18.214 --> 39:21.615
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

39:21.817 --> 39:23.944
- Betty!
- Go! Just go!

39:36.031 --> 39:38.397
Get out of here, Betty! Go!

39:38.634 --> 39:41.398
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go!

39:45.241 --> 39:47.835
- Betty! Betty!
- L.J., hurry up!

39:49.945 --> 39:51.242
Come with me!

40:06.796 --> 40:09.458
Come on! Come on! Betty! Betty!

40:11.300 --> 40:12.733
No!

40:17.440 --> 40:19.169
Betty!

40:29.318 --> 40:31.013
Go! Go! Go!

41:28.811 --> 41:30.369
Dr. Isaacs.

41:30.579 --> 41:32.911
Another spike in alpha
and beta waves detected.

41:33.115 --> 41:37.313
Forty-five percent probability
that this is Project Alice.

41:37.520 --> 41:40.250
Triangulate. Find her location.

41:44.426 --> 41:46.326
Impressive.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.195
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

41:49.398 --> 41:52.128
Her powers would appear to have
grown at a geometric rate...

41:52.334 --> 41:55.428
...since her escape from
the Detroit facility.

41:58.007 --> 42:02.171
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.

42:02.411 --> 42:06.677
Any trip to the surface, especially to
gather specimens, puts my men at risk.

42:06.882 --> 42:08.873
Why do you need so many
all of a sudden?

42:09.084 --> 42:10.881
Isaacs!

42:11.086 --> 42:13.418
My research has intensified.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.920
Don't worry.
They're perfectly secure.

42:25.467 --> 42:27.560
You're supposed to be
domesticating them.

42:27.803 --> 42:29.794
Sometimes aggression has its uses.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.371
What could you possibly need
these things for?

42:32.575 --> 42:33.872
Dr. Isaacs.

42:34.076 --> 42:37.705
Specimen 87 has reached
the final stage of the test grid.

42:37.913 --> 42:40.404
Perfect. Put her on the screen.

42:45.421 --> 42:47.013
Good girl.

42:54.530 --> 42:57.294
Is Chairman Wesker
even aware of this?

42:57.499 --> 42:59.933
He knows what he needs to know.

43:00.302 --> 43:02.463
You've overstepped your mark.

43:03.072 --> 43:06.405
My research will change
the face of everything.

43:08.143 --> 43:10.111
If you pick a side...

43:11.614 --> 43:13.582
...be sure it's the right one.

43:35.604 --> 43:36.866
Hi.

43:37.373 --> 43:38.863
Hey.

43:43.345 --> 43:44.937
This belong to you?

43:45.914 --> 43:47.814
I gave it to you last night.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.350
For luck.

43:50.919 --> 43:52.580
Thank you.

43:53.756 --> 43:54.882
What's your name?

43:55.791 --> 43:57.019
K-Mart.

43:58.127 --> 43:59.719
It's where they found me.

43:59.928 --> 44:01.987
Claire and the other...

44:02.331 --> 44:03.662
A few years back.

44:04.667 --> 44:07.568
Do you have another name?

44:07.936 --> 44:09.733
Never liked it.

44:12.341 --> 44:14.901
Everyone I knew was dead...

44:16.345 --> 44:18.404
...so seemed like time for a change.

44:27.523 --> 44:29.821
Anyone want to say something?

44:54.983 --> 44:57.178
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.454
She's the one who put this
convoy together.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.283
Thank you so much for your help.

45:03.058 --> 45:04.116
Claire!

45:06.361 --> 45:09.330
Excuse me. I have things
I have to attend to.

45:15.170 --> 45:18.071
In the last six months,
she lost half of the convoy.

45:19.041 --> 45:22.135
Pretty soon there'll be
more of us dead than alive.

45:24.012 --> 45:25.877
Alice, what happened to you?

45:26.415 --> 45:28.440
Why did you leave after Detroit?

45:29.418 --> 45:32.649
I didn't have a choice.
They were using me.

45:33.655 --> 45:35.555
What do you mean?

45:35.758 --> 45:37.453
They were tracking me.

45:37.659 --> 45:39.718
I couldn't be around you.
Any of you.

45:40.329 --> 45:44.095
- I would've gotten you all killed.
- That's why you disappeared?

45:44.299 --> 45:48.292
Broke into an Umbrella facility
and hacked into their computers...

45:48.504 --> 45:51.234
...downloaded the satellite
trajectories...

45:51.440 --> 45:53.465
...and stayed off the grid.

45:53.675 --> 45:55.700
And after the world ended?

45:55.911 --> 45:58.379
Why stay out there alone?

46:00.249 --> 46:04.117
It's just safer
if I'm not around people.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.747
Why'd you come back?

46:31.747 --> 46:33.271
Damn!

46:34.883 --> 46:36.282
What time is it?

46:36.485 --> 46:38.544
Chase, what time is it?

46:40.489 --> 46:45.358
Well, Carlos, it is 12:14. Why?
You got somewhere you gotta be?

46:46.995 --> 46:48.656
Guess I'm just being paranoid.

46:56.705 --> 46:58.605
Welcome home.

47:07.716 --> 47:09.308
Got a minute?

47:09.985 --> 47:11.009
Yeah.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.745
Everyone is grateful
for you helping us out.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.390
But how long am I gonna stay?

47:16.592 --> 47:18.617
Don't get me wrong.

47:19.161 --> 47:21.425
We really are grateful.

47:24.132 --> 47:27.761
They're all talking about what you did.
And they're scared.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.870
I don't blame them.

47:31.707 --> 47:34.801
People have a habit
of dying around me.

47:36.144 --> 47:37.406
Not just you.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.054
<i>You're positive it's her?</i>

47:48.257 --> 47:52.717
Sixty-two percent.
Too great a chance to pass up.

47:53.562 --> 47:57.396
If it is Project Alice, she's been
evading the satellite grid for years.

47:57.633 --> 47:59.601
I've re-routed
the remaining satellites.

47:59.801 --> 48:02.736
We can reacquire the subject.
She'll be unaware of surveillance.

48:02.971 --> 48:05.166
I can have a strike team ready
within the hour.

48:05.374 --> 48:09.572
No. We'll establish
a positive identification first.

48:09.778 --> 48:11.439
One hundred percent.

48:11.647 --> 48:14.810
The group she's with
include known associates.

48:15.017 --> 48:18.544
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research...

48:18.754 --> 48:21.348
...to the whole process
of domestication. Her blood...

48:21.590 --> 48:23.785
...her genetic structure, is the key.

48:23.992 --> 48:26.825
The longer she's out there,
the greater chance we lose her.

48:27.062 --> 48:29.929
- I can't risk that.
- That decision isn't yours to make.

48:31.066 --> 48:33.933
Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee...

48:34.136 --> 48:37.435
...at the next scheduled meeting.
And, doctor...

48:37.639 --> 48:38.731
...that's an order.

48:43.345 --> 48:47.008
These transmissions are the best
indication of life we've seen in months.

48:47.215 --> 48:49.115
- Alaska?
- We have to check it out.

48:49.318 --> 48:50.717
We can't just ignore it.

48:50.919 --> 48:52.910
Any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

48:53.121 --> 48:56.147
- Yeah. A long one.
- And at the end of it, what?

48:56.358 --> 48:59.054
You have no guarantee there's even
anyone alive up there.

48:59.261 --> 49:02.753
- These transmissions say that...
- They're dated six months ago.

49:02.965 --> 49:05.331
How many radio broadcasts
have we responded to?

49:06.234 --> 49:08.794
How many times
have we got there too late?

49:09.004 --> 49:12.804
The transmissions say that
there's no infection up there.

49:13.008 --> 49:14.498
It's isolated.

49:14.710 --> 49:16.041
Safe.

49:17.045 --> 49:19.775
This convoy trusts me
with their lives.

49:19.982 --> 49:21.973
These people don't need
pipe dreams.

49:22.451 --> 49:24.544
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

49:25.587 --> 49:26.713
Look at them, Claire.

49:27.255 --> 49:32.056
Six months ago, there were 50 of us,
then 40, now there's less than 30.

49:33.462 --> 49:35.521
They're starting to give up.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.456
They need some kind of hope.

49:46.274 --> 49:48.435
We have a decision to make.

49:49.277 --> 49:52.804
And it's too big, it's too important
for me to make for you.

49:54.349 --> 49:56.374
There's a chance
there are survivors.

49:56.585 --> 49:57.950
Where?

49:58.153 --> 50:00.053
In Alaska.

50:01.289 --> 50:03.450
There is a chance...

50:03.658 --> 50:06.752
...that the infection
hasn't reached that far.

50:06.962 --> 50:09.192
But we don't know for sure.

50:09.398 --> 50:11.229
So we have a choice.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.396
We stay as we are...

50:14.169 --> 50:16.262
...or we try for Alaska.

50:18.707 --> 50:20.504
For Alaska.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.176
Alaska.

50:39.995 --> 50:41.087
I hope you're right.

50:54.543 --> 50:55.942
God.

51:09.758 --> 51:12.921
The food's virtually gone
and the truck's running on empty.

51:13.161 --> 51:15.391
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it.

51:15.597 --> 51:18.327
- Chase?
- Shit, I don't even have empty.

51:18.967 --> 51:21.834
I got enough for
a hundred miles, tops.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.733
If we're gonna make this trip,
we'll need to resupply.

51:24.940 --> 51:26.407
Yep.

51:27.576 --> 51:29.237
These are our options.

51:29.444 --> 51:33.141
The nearest, safest bet
is right there.

51:33.648 --> 51:36.082
No, it's empty. I tried that.

51:37.185 --> 51:39.085
Then, well, maybe...

51:39.287 --> 51:41.949
- We could try this...
- Vegas.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.618
It's the only place we're sure to find
gas and supplies.

51:45.827 --> 51:48.318
There's a reason for that.
Vegas is too dangerous.

51:48.530 --> 51:50.191
It's crawling with them
sons of bitches.

51:50.398 --> 51:53.367
We've drained every small town dry
over the last six months.

51:53.568 --> 51:55.934
We have to hit a big city.

51:56.204 --> 51:57.831
She's right.

51:58.206 --> 52:00.504
Vegas, it's our only bet.

52:08.683 --> 52:11.311
<i>We'll establish</i>
<i>a positive identification.</i>

52:11.520 --> 52:12.885
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

52:13.822 --> 52:18.156
<i>Take no action until this matter has</i>
<i>been discussed by the committee.</i>

52:18.660 --> 52:20.218
<i>Doctor...</i>

52:20.829 --> 52:22.524
<i>... that's an order.</i>

52:32.541 --> 52:36.068
<i>The committee authorizes</i>
<i>immediate action.</i>

52:36.278 --> 52:39.213
<i>Release of vehicles</i>
<i>and personnel...</i>

52:39.414 --> 52:42.747
<i>... under command of Dr. Isaacs.</i>

52:43.118 --> 52:45.086
<i>That's an order.</i>

54:15.210 --> 54:16.575
Hey. You all right?

54:16.778 --> 54:18.609
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:19.214 --> 54:22.911
Them pork and beans, they lethal.
I don't see how you cowboys do it.

54:24.219 --> 54:26.187
Years of practice.

54:37.966 --> 54:39.763
Oh, my God.

55:12.767 --> 55:14.826
What happened to it?

55:15.503 --> 55:17.664
The desert must have taken it back.

55:18.606 --> 55:19.766
Five years.

55:19.974 --> 55:22.238
No one to keep the sand back.

55:30.085 --> 55:31.746
It's empty.

55:32.220 --> 55:33.346
No undead.

55:34.255 --> 55:35.847
Nothing.

55:36.191 --> 55:39.786
Those birds must have moved
through the city block by block.

55:40.462 --> 55:42.089
Picked it clean.

55:50.271 --> 55:52.569
I don't see any truck stops.

55:53.641 --> 55:55.165
Where are they?

55:55.643 --> 55:56.871
There.

55:57.078 --> 55:59.740
Valet parking at the casino
up ahead.

55:59.948 --> 56:01.779
There's gas pumps in there.

56:01.983 --> 56:03.678
Now, how do you know that?

56:03.885 --> 56:05.785
I dropped two G's
back in the day here.

56:06.254 --> 56:08.085
You lost $2000?

56:24.839 --> 56:26.033
Damn it.

56:38.319 --> 56:40.048
Spread them out!

56:43.091 --> 56:44.490
We're gonna have to move it.

56:58.573 --> 57:00.803
All right, Chase, I need a lookout!

57:01.709 --> 57:02.971
Up there.

57:11.853 --> 57:13.548
Great.

57:23.998 --> 57:28.128
Climb the Eiffel Tower
with a high-powered rifle.

57:28.703 --> 57:31.365
A few years ago,
that would've caused a stir.

57:33.641 --> 57:37.372
Well, let the good times roll.

57:57.165 --> 57:58.223
Let's get this done.

57:58.833 --> 58:01.165
Get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the winch.

58:01.369 --> 58:02.802
- Yeah.
- Carlos.

58:32.267 --> 58:33.825
Wait.

58:41.209 --> 58:42.574
Get back!

59:11.639 --> 59:13.106
- Carlos, cover me!
- Go!

01:00:04.525 --> 01:00:05.890
Move!

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:37.653
Just get to the back and stay quiet.
Go! Now! Go!

01:00:40.194 --> 01:00:41.456
Get down!

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:58.404
She really is magnificent.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:03.041
When she's dead,
make sure you move in fast.

01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:05.974
I need a sample of her blood
while it's still warm.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.239
That won't be a problem.

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:13.051
- Satellite in position?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:14.155 --> 01:02:16.146
Then shut her down.

01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:56.758
Mikey!

01:03:02.336 --> 01:03:03.428
Hey!

01:03:21.823 --> 01:03:23.347
Mikey!

01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:27.952
No!

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.695
No!

01:03:59.026 --> 01:04:01.358
She's fighting the conditioning.

01:04:01.562 --> 01:04:02.927
Boost the control signal.

01:04:10.605 --> 01:04:11.697
Shit!

01:04:11.906 --> 01:04:14.534
Climb! Give me your hand!

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:24.144
Run! Go!

01:04:24.352 --> 01:04:26.411
Go! Run!

01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:28.384
Let's go!

01:04:41.769 --> 01:04:42.793
L.J.!

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:48.198
L.J.

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:17.830
What is it?

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.303
Satellite. Some kind of malfunction.

01:05:48.703 --> 01:05:49.863
How long?

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:53.700
New feed coming online
in 15 seconds.

01:05:58.479 --> 01:06:00.970
Online in three, two...

01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:03.282
Now.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.079
Where the hell is she going?

01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:12.619
Shut her down!

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.490
She's still coming!

01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:23.135
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:29.803
You son of a...

01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:33.443
Back to base!

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.389
The anti-virus!
Get me the anti-virus!

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.868
Why didn't you shoot?

01:07:01.075 --> 01:07:04.841
Because we're not driving to Alaska.
I want that helicopter intact.

01:07:05.446 --> 01:07:08.381
Let's go look at the computer,
see where that chopper's headed.

01:07:22.763 --> 01:07:24.321
- How is he?
- Under house arrest...

01:07:24.532 --> 01:07:27.023
...as you instructed.
He's been quiet.

01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:43.812
How much of this have you used?

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.213
Her blood increased
the creatures' power.

01:07:46.987 --> 01:07:49.854
It also increased the strength
of the infection.

01:07:53.427 --> 01:07:54.917
I needed it.

01:07:55.429 --> 01:07:58.057
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:04.993
Oh, I have an idea.

01:08:05.773 --> 01:08:07.798
You're out of control.

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:09.975
Well, this ends here.

01:08:10.177 --> 01:08:12.941
Under executive order 1345,
issued by Chairman Wesker...

01:08:13.147 --> 01:08:15.308
...for gross misconduct in the field...

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.911
...I sentence you to
summary liquidation.

01:08:18.786 --> 01:08:20.014
Liquidation?

01:08:21.421 --> 01:08:23.082
Just die.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.959
Take the body to the surface.
Bring me the stats on Program Alice...

01:08:35.169 --> 01:08:36.602
Sir!

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.995
Good thing we like a challenge.

01:09:21.549 --> 01:09:23.073
Hold on.

01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:25.309
Hold on.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.779
They have the anti-virus in there.

01:09:28.988 --> 01:09:30.684
Just hold on.

01:09:31.825 --> 01:09:33.520
It's too late, and you know it.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:39.261
Besides, you need a way
to get in there.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.490
And I have an idea.

01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:58.211
- You keep them safe, huh?
- You got it.

01:10:05.059 --> 01:10:06.424
Come here.

01:10:24.044 --> 01:10:25.477
Carlos, I...

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.541
Save it.

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.280
You just promise me one thing.

01:10:36.056 --> 01:10:38.286
When you get down there...

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.385
Consider it done.

01:11:41.655 --> 01:11:43.680
Wish I had a smoke.

01:12:08.716 --> 01:12:10.081
Fuck!

01:12:24.365 --> 01:12:26.299
I'll be damned.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.298
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:38.068
Oh, hell.

01:12:41.548 --> 01:12:43.140
Come on.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.795
Get the kids out quickly!

01:13:35.002 --> 01:13:36.435
Go!

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:42.603
- Run! Run! Hurry up!
- Okay.

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:44.004
Go! Go! Go!

01:13:46.113 --> 01:13:47.705
Take him!

01:13:53.187 --> 01:13:54.677
You're not coming?

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:57.489
Take care of the others.

01:17:22.195 --> 01:17:24.720
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:28.894
- I am the artificial intelligence...
- I know what you are.

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:30.694
I knew your sister.

01:17:30.904 --> 01:17:32.895
She was a homicidal bitch.

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:36.208
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path...

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:38.207
...for the preservation of human life.

01:17:38.412 --> 01:17:40.539
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.

01:17:41.515 --> 01:17:42.846
So, what happened here?

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.816
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected
state. He was bitten by a creature...

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.648
...that had been treated
with a newly developed serum.

01:17:49.856 --> 01:17:52.051
A serum derived from your blood.

01:17:52.993 --> 01:17:55.826
The resulting infection
has caused massive mutation.

01:17:58.932 --> 01:17:59.921
My blood?

01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:01.998
Your blood has bonded
with the T-virus.

01:18:02.202 --> 01:18:03.726
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced...

01:18:03.937 --> 01:18:07.839
...that it could be used
to destroy the biohazard for good.

01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:11.438
You mean my blood
is the cure for all this?

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.112
Correct.

01:18:13.747 --> 01:18:15.442
So why are you helping me?

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.584
Your blood is pure,
and this facility contains...

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:22.050
...all of the equipment you will require
to synthesize a cure.

01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:27.788
- You mean this could all end?
- Correct.

01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:29.389
There is, however...

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:32.298
...a small problem.

01:18:38.739 --> 01:18:40.900
<i>I have him contained</i>
<i>in the lower levels...</i>

01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:43.838
<i>... but I cannot hold him there</i>
<i>for much longer.</i>

01:18:46.913 --> 01:18:47.971
All right, let's go.

01:18:59.726 --> 01:19:01.057
<i>Alice?</i>

01:19:01.962 --> 01:19:03.293
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:23:10.243 --> 01:23:12.473
You can't kill me.

01:24:01.094 --> 01:24:02.254
I've told you...

01:24:02.695 --> 01:24:04.890
...I can't die.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.282
No.

01:24:52.979 --> 01:24:55.812
For so long, I thought
you were the future.

01:24:56.616 --> 01:24:58.140
I was wrong.

01:24:58.618 --> 01:25:01.348
I am the future.

01:25:07.861 --> 01:25:09.294
No.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:11.891
You're just...

01:25:12.098 --> 01:25:14.066
...another asshole.

01:25:16.936 --> 01:25:19.370
And we're both gonna die
down here.

01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:43.892
Yeah, you're the future, all right.

01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:23.030
All attempts to contact the North
American facility continue to fail.

01:26:23.403 --> 01:26:25.337
How long have they been off the air?

01:26:25.538 --> 01:26:27.472
Seventeen hours.

01:26:27.674 --> 01:26:31.041
We must consider them lost.
But our plans remain unchanged.

01:26:31.244 --> 01:26:33.439
All data will be transferred
to this facility...

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:37.047
...and the research will continue
under my personal supervision.

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:39.718
I expect results within one month.

01:26:39.919 --> 01:26:41.887
You won't have to wait that long, boys.

01:26:42.522 --> 01:26:44.285
Because I'm coming for you.

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:45.682
And...

01:26:46.292 --> 01:26:48.954
...l'm gonna be bringing
a few of my friends.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.211
<i>You're just...</i>

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:55.717
<i>... another asshole.</i>
