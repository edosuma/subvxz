WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:06.798
<i>Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.</i>

00:06.881 --> 00:09.634
Okay, we've got a big case.
Let's split up into two teams.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.845
A-team goes to city hall,
where the action is.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.722
The A-team is T-Squad,
group in the corner.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.474
B-team, Baxter, X, dog man,
stays back at the hotel.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.059
-Why are we B-team?

00:18.143 --> 00:19.602
You are now under our control.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.690
<i>The US Marshals are at city hall,
where they think an attack is coming.</i>

00:23.773 --> 00:27.068
Honestly, Chief, I'm glad I left Turner
and the dog back at the hotel.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.988
You know, I'm still not exactly sure
how to train him.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.948
-Maybe you have to play more.
-Play, like how?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.450
What do you like to do for fun?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
-I jog.
-We could jog.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.494
-Yeah. How about Thursday?
-Yes!

00:36.578 --> 00:39.789
Hey, I was wondering if you found out
any more information on Dad's files.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.792
This is Valley Road, where they
found Dad after the heart attack.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.918
Dad's old watch.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.212
<i>Hooch is getting bad vibes.
You're getting them too.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:47.464
Yeah.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.637
So cool you're into running too.
Yeah, it's the best.

00:55.305 --> 00:59.017
Do you always start at 5:00 a.m.?

00:59.100 --> 01:02.270
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it gets you up, kick-starts the day.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.688
-Yeah.
-Everyone's in bed.

01:04.397 --> 01:08.109
All those dummies still in beds.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.987
Quiet really helps me think.
-Mmm.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.948
You're doing great.
-Thank you. Yeah, you too. Super great.

01:14.032 --> 01:17.285
Hey, maybe we should stop.
Hooch is winded.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.037
Oh. Okay.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.542
Hey, um, I've been thinking about
asking you something.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.171
-It's about Hooch.
-Of course.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.840
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Sure. What is it?

01:30.924 --> 01:35.387
You've gotten to know him a little bit,
and, uh, you keep saying he has potential.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.513
Oh, tons.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.224
-Yeah, he's smart, passionate.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.102
He's playful. Tons of potential.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.728
Potential for what?

01:43.812 --> 01:48.191
'Cause with Jessica going on office duty,
I kinda gotta make an impression at work.

01:48.692 --> 01:52.821
I don't know, right now it seems like
Hooch's big skill is embarrassing me.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.739
Well, he's got a great nose.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.201
He already did some tracking
with that witness who went missing,

01:58.284 --> 02:01.913
so I say we start there, build on that.

02:01.996 --> 02:02.997
Okay.

02:03.748 --> 02:04.582
Hear that, buddy?

02:04.666 --> 02:07.836
Use your nose for something other than
finding food you're not supposed to eat.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.672
Maybe we should take an Uber back.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.675
-Okay.
-I think he has a side cramp.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.343
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.430
I think there's a pickup point
like a mile from here.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.515
-Oh, great.
-Yeah, awesome.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.351
Another mile. Fun.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.902
One last piece of business.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.363
His desk is getting a bit cluttered,

03:16.446 --> 03:19.574
but I've got some hardware
for one of our deputies.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.411
The Northern District of California
recognizes Trent Havelock

03:23.495 --> 03:25.872
for sustained investigative excellence.

03:25.955 --> 03:26.998
Get on up here, Trent.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.125
-T! T!

03:30.335 --> 03:31.753
Trent again?

03:31.836 --> 03:33.171
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Chief.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.299
When are you getting a plaque
for totaling the most service vehicles?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.884
-Whoa.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.552
Jealousy's a bad look, Baxter.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.096
Hooch, no, no, no.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.764
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.933
No. No, no!

03:46.643 --> 03:48.520
Hooch, no. What are you doing?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.523
I got this. I got this.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.441
Maybe this is a good place to stop.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.903
Trent, grab your team, meet in my office.
I got some intel from the ATF.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.075
Cute.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.369
Please, don't encourage him. Please.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.415
-This one looks safe.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.332
Mmm.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.586
-I swear, if I could marry a food...
-You're talking about doughnuts right now?

04:13.670 --> 04:17.007
You know,
Trent just got an award for a case we did.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.093
Trent got a piece of plastic
for being teacher's pet. Who cares?

04:20.176 --> 04:22.470
You're the one who keeps telling me
I need to find a new partner

04:22.554 --> 04:24.389
for when the chief puts you on desk duty.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.307
I mean, Trent's obviously crushing it.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.434
Wait, wait, wait, no.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.102
I was not talking about Trent.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.106
I was thinking, like, Andy's nice or Jenna

04:33.690 --> 04:34.983
or Xavier.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.192
Xavier?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.946
I'm not even sure he's from this planet.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.115
I don't know if you noticed,
but Trent and the T-Squad,

04:42.198 --> 04:45.326
they're in tight with the chief,
get all the good cases, and I'm stuck on--

04:45.410 --> 04:47.662
-Let me tell you something, and trust me...

04:47.746 --> 04:49.998
...Hooch is twice the deputy
Trent will ever be.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.709
Hooch has your back,
he's not worried about taking credit,

04:52.792 --> 04:56.046
and he has really, really,
really good taste in doughnuts.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.218
Hey, Matthew,
help me clean up a little bit, please.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.179
Um, Uncle Scott's gonna be here
any minute.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.847
He's coming here again?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.849
I think he might need
some help with Hooch.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.851
-You think you can handle that?
-Yeah. Sure.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.102
-Okay.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.187
Hey, guys.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.563
-Hey.
-You're here!

05:13.646 --> 05:14.981
Hi.
Hooch!

05:15.899 --> 05:19.486
-I am also here, your human uncle.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
Can I take Hooch to my bedroom?

05:21.654 --> 05:23.782
Yes, take him forever. Go.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.992
Okay, let's play US Marshals.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.412
You be you, and I'll be Uncle Scott,
and I'll help you chase a bad guy.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.749
Or a bad girl.
Women can be criminals too, okay?

05:32.832 --> 05:33.833
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.252
Um, so,
sorry to put you to work right away,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.797
but can you help me build a volcano
for Matthew's science class?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.591
Dad used to help with that kind of thing,
and I'm completely hopeless.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.218
-Sure, why not?
-Thanks.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.098
Maybe we should color the cotton gray
for the pyroclastic flow.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.433
I think we're okay.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.310
Matthew's at the, you know,

05:52.394 --> 05:55.397
fire-comes-from-the-ground stage
of volcano science.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.192
You okay?

05:59.275 --> 06:00.360
Rough day.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.654
And it's not getting better anytime soon.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.407
You know Jessica's going on desk duty
for the baby,

06:05.490 --> 06:07.075
so I'm losing my human partner.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.452
And the chief is the one
who gives out assignments,

06:09.536 --> 06:12.664
and if you're not one of his favorites,
you're me.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.165
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.960
You have been training for this
your entire life, okay?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.129
I think we're done.
What do you think, bud?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.422
I think it's good.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.757
-I'll go get the stuff to make lava.
Great idea.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.259
-Lava!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.886
Let's hear it, Matt.
Lava, lava!

06:28.054 --> 06:29.639
Aw, how you doing?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.641
Why do I always-- I always do that.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.476
-Oh, here.
-Thank you.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.022
By the way, I did a little more digging
into the criminals from Dad's files

06:37.105 --> 06:38.231
in the system at work.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.733
You did? That's great.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.820
I'll show you, but don't get too excited.
I didn't find much.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.867
I ran 'em all through the database.
Some bad folks here.

06:48.950 --> 06:53.246
Gang leader from Modesto,
drug trafficker from SoCal.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.082
But-- But none of them are connected
to each other.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.918
Most of them don't even have a connection
to Cypress Beach.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.337
Most?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.630
So, Dad arrested this guy once.

07:02.714 --> 07:06.176
Uh, small-time local troublemaker,
Wyatt Tolliver.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.346
Hmm. Interesting.
Maybe he's our way into the case.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.098
Not a case at the moment, right?
Just files, random files.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.100
-This isn't random.
-Not connected.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.686
Dad put them all together.
There's binder clips.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.355
You know what? I know it's weird,

07:18.438 --> 07:22.692
but we have to remember, right, like,
big cases weren't exactly Dad's thing.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.361
-Right?
-What are you talking about?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.863
Dad solved the biggest case
in our town's history.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.116
Yeah, and he spent the rest of his life
on the smallest ones.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.786
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Hooch attacked the volcano!

07:32.869 --> 07:35.538
-What are you doing? What are you--
-That was so epic.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.249
Wow.
-Hooch was like a giant volcano monster.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.463
-Hooch, come here!

07:48.510 --> 07:50.261
What's going on over there?

07:50.345 --> 07:53.264
It's that case the chief
pulled Trent in on yesterday.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.851
A fugitive jewel thief. Krista something.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.020
Krista St. Jean? Was it Krista St. Jean?

07:59.104 --> 08:00.188
I-- That sounds right.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.108
Are you serious right now?
She's in the Bay Area?

08:03.191 --> 08:05.193
Oh, Jess, we should go talk to Trent.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.404
-Uh-uh. No. No way.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.697
My clock is ticking here.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.367
You think I'm gonna spend
my last few days on the street with Trent?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.451
No.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.246
The marshals have been after
Krista St. Jean forever.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.416
I had her wanted poster on my vision board
since before I was sworn in.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.626
What else is on your vision board?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.378
Just my goals and dreams.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.214
If I can get on a case like this,
I'd be set.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.800
Correction, Trent will be set.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.010
That's how he rolls.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.554
A case like Krista St. Jean,
it doesn't come around twice.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.181
I help nab her,
I got a new partner for sure.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.475
I'm gonna do it. Gonna talk to him.
Should I talk to him?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.060
-No.
-I'm gonna talk to him.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.438
You're not listening.
It's the opposite of what I said, but...

08:41.521 --> 08:42.522
What?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.024
I warned you.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.276
There she is.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.986
Krista St. Jean.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.238
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's deadly.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.157
Rolls with a takedown crew
of ex-army guys.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.659
Hit a dozen jewelry stores back East.
Hit 'em hard.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.244
ATF wants her on weapons charges.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.998
Now, we caught a break,
tracked her to the Axiom Hotel downtown.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.210
This is from the hotel lobby
when she checked out, 45 minutes ago.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.088
Axiom's down the street
from the Golden State Gem and Trade Show,

09:07.172 --> 09:09.174
largest jewelry trade show
on the West Coast.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.258
Opens in two days.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.427
We believe she's casing that
for her next heist.

09:13.011 --> 09:13.970
This is big.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.930
She's slipped through
the Service's fingers before,

09:16.014 --> 09:17.974
but this time,
T-Squad's gonna take her down.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.476
-Yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.020
-We're heading downtown. Let's do this.
-Stay frosty.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.232
Hey, uh, uh, Trent,
I think I might be able to help.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.942
I've studied the St. Jean case.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.279
Yeah, thanks for the offer, rook,
but I've already got a kick-ass team.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.865
Of course.
But, um, you don't have a K-9 unit.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.035
If you had anything with Krista's scent,
Hooch might be able to track her.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.871
Turner's got a point. Dog came through
with that FBI witness thing.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.999
Exactly what I was thinking too, Chief.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.419
Dog it is.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.005
Okay, you R-2-R-O?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
Ready to roll...

09:51.174 --> 09:52.384
-Over?
-Why would I roll over?

09:52.467 --> 09:53.802
-I don't know.
-That makes no sense.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.428
It doesn't. You're right.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.597
-Just come with me.
-Okay.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.307
Thanks.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.022
Just be cool with the T-Squad, you know?

10:06.523 --> 10:08.108
They're just deputies like us.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.027
Or me, 'cause you're a dog.
You get the point.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.071
Today's our chance to impress 'em.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.781
This could be big.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.120
So is there like a T-Squad group chat
I should get on or...

10:20.662 --> 10:21.996
Okay, here's the deal.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.290
The manager said this pillowcase
was in Krista's room.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.583
It should still have her scent.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.961
Our bandit was standing in this spot
only an hour ago.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.422
-Can that thing track her?
-As long as she's still in the area.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.715
Okay, let's see.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.135
All right. All right, bud.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.553
Got it. Ready?

10:38.555 --> 10:39.806
Okay.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.064
Anytime.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.525
It's just gotta marinate for a second.
There we go.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.946
That's the way to the trade show.
Okay, follow the dog!

10:56.114 --> 10:58.241
Looking good, boy. Do your thing.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.410
Is it drunk or something?
Why's it weaving around?

11:00.493 --> 11:03.246
This is part of it.
I think he's onto something.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.124
Trade show's in this area.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.543
Looks like you were right about Krista
casing the place.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.129
We're the T-Squad, baby.
We're always ahead of the game.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.714
Dog's doing good, bro.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.883
We need to get you
a call sign or something.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.010
Like Dawg, only spelled the cool way.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.304
Or Animal, because it's an animal.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.098
-Boom. Animal. Anointed.
-Boom.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.600
Looking good, Hooch.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.146
-Hey, hey, bud.
What's going on here, Animal?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.106
-Normal. Totally normal.
-It's not normal.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.193
He probably needs the scent.
So I'm gonna give that again.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.614
Okay, Hooch. Tracking, remember? Tracking.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.450
-Turner, you know how to use this or not?
-One sec.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.535
-Bad time for a belly rub, Hooch.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.288
Don't do this to me, Hooch.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.706
Come on. You can find her.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.750
Hurry. Chase, Hooch. Chase.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.834
Come on.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.628
Come on.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.015
Guys, we're back on it. Let's go.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.268
Good job, Hooch. You got it.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.771
<i>Special Operations Group, incoming.</i>

12:11.981 --> 12:14.317
We passed the trade show
a block ago. Why would she be here?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.111
I don't know, but he's speeding up.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.196
Maybe she's with her crew.
We can nail 'em all.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.824
-Come on!
-Move, move!

12:23.618 --> 12:25.662
-In here! In here!

12:25.745 --> 12:28.123
She's in there?
What is this place?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.917
Marcus, cover the back entrance.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.295
-A pet store?
-Um, maybe Krista stopped in here.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.090
You think Krista St. Jean,
the country's biggest jewel thief,

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
went into a pet store?

12:43.054 --> 12:45.932
Twelve deputies, four SUVs,
a Special Ops Group,

12:46.016 --> 12:47.684
and we just caught a squeaky toy.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.729
Nice one, rookie.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.188
Dead end. Let's move out.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.734
You gonna pay for that?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.362
-Oh, um...
-You squeak it, you buy it.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.032
Twenty-eight bucks.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.116
Twenty-eight dollars.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.453
Twenty-eight!

13:09.706 --> 13:11.666
Krista St. Jean
passed through the intersection

13:11.750 --> 13:14.669
one block from where you stopped
to give your dog a freakin' belly rub.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.504
We were so close.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.089
Close doesn't cut it.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.674
Ah, it's my fault.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.635
I shouldn't have brought you on.
You've barely been on the street.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.555
I pushed Hooch pretty hard.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.934
Don't pass the buck, bro.
If I miss a shot, I don't blame the gun.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.353
-Yeah.
-Look, man.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.813
If you wanna roll with the T-Squad,
you gotta be 100% accountable.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.898
Okay.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.567
Did you screw up? Yes.
Is everybody laughing at you?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.819
-Probably not-- Yes.
-Yes. A lot of people are.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.864
-Of course.
-But from failure comes a bridge to...

13:43.865 --> 13:45.241
-Terabithia?
-What?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.451
I'm sorry.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.954
Yeah. I gotta build a bridge, to success.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.039
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.665
-That's exactly right.
-Copy.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.667
That's what it takes to be on the team.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.711
At the end of the day,
if you're not on the team,

13:56.795 --> 13:57.921
then who the hell are you?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.131
Some weird loner like Xavier.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.175
Does he get dressed in the dark?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.262
Anyway.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.347
You'll learn, rook.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.516
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.561
Go away.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.980
-We're done here. This is over. Okay.
-Okay.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.274
Hey, Turner.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.695
-Can I get a belly rub?

14:22.237 --> 14:24.114
That's funny. Sick burn.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.580
So how's your plan
to impress the cool kids going?

14:32.664 --> 14:34.708
They let you sit at their lunch table yet?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.585
Jess, we were one block away from Krista.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.630
Well, at least Hooch got a new toy.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.134
Wait, what is that? Like, a herring?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.219
Yes.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.901
Please cut it out, okay?
I'm trying to study.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.529
We cannot blow this
if we get a second chance.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.823
Okay, that's it.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.742
No more squeaking. No!

15:10.285 --> 15:11.578
I'm taking it. I'm taking it.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.956
-You've left me no ch-- Wow.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.593
Oh, will you please shut up?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.806
Will you please just stop?

15:31.890 --> 15:34.642
I am begging you
from the bottom of my heart.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.686
-Just please.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.771
I'll trade you.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.022
What do you want?

15:39.689 --> 15:41.941
You want this pillow?
You already made your mark.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.779
Okay. All right.
I'm coming in from uptown.

15:45.862 --> 15:49.616
You want Mr. Horsey?
This is cool, right? Okay.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.410
Argyle socks. Yeah!

15:52.994 --> 15:55.121
Twenty-two dollars! Cool, right?

15:55.205 --> 15:56.247
You want this?

15:59.834 --> 16:01.461
-No trade.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.257
I don't care! Bark away!

16:15.100 --> 16:16.518
Hi, Mrs. Mandelbaum.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.230
Yeah, uh,
I'm very sorry about the barking.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.190
Yeah, I-I know it's very late.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.150
Sorry. Bye.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.423
It seemed liked Hooch was on it. You know?
Just so focused.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.924
Turns out he was just shopping.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.301
And somehow Trent thinks I screwed up.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.054
Well, kind of. You did. Twice.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.224
Like when he went straight?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.560
That's just not how dogs track.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.562
But it seemed like Hooch
knew where he was going.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.813
I mean, that's the thing.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.607
A tracking dog doesn't know
where it's going,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.192
it's finding where it's going.

17:06.735 --> 17:10.071
Well, what was I supposed to do?
You know, I gave him belly rubs.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.073
I was encouraging him, like, really hard.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.617
Yeah, that. Also a mistake.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.370
It's 'cause dogs,
they look at us for their cues.

17:17.454 --> 17:21.291
So you wanted a chase,
and Hooch gave you a chase.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.293
I mean, he was trying to make you happy.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.211
Oh, I'm not happy.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.631
No, this was a big opportunity
to partner up with Trent,

17:28.715 --> 17:31.009
and all Hooch cares about
is that squeaky toy.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.178
Squeak, squeak, squeak,
squeak, squeak, squeak.

17:33.261 --> 17:36.431
All the time. It's all the time.
It's driving me insane.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.391
I have an idea.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.019
Curtis.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.146
Hi.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.773
Can you come help me for a sec?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.399
Do you mean like an actual second?

17:46.483 --> 17:49.319
'Cause I gotta feed the dogs
in seven minutes or they get anxious.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.529
We will be done by then. Promise.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.200
I want you to meet Scott.
He's a deputy marshal.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.868
And that's Hooch.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.621
And Scott, this is Curtis, my brother.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.706
-He helps with training here.
-That's awesome.

18:01.790 --> 18:02.832
Nice meeting you.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.460
Curtis is autistic.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.295
And you're neurotypical.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.549
-I can tell. That's okay.
-Thanks.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.802
Can I borrow your hat?
We're gonna play hide-and-go-seek.

18:13.885 --> 18:14.928
Oh, okay.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.598
Hey. Good luck, Hooch.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.648
-Did he just give you the fish?
-Yeah.

18:26.731 --> 18:30.026
-Okay, Hooch. Go get him. Go find Curtis.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.237
Where is he hiding, Hooch?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.072
-See him weaving?

18:34.155 --> 18:36.950
That's him following
the cone of scent in the air.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.995
Dogs have enough smell receptors to smell
a single hot dog on Fisherman's Wharf,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.164
so Hooch's nose is not the problem.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.750
The trick is knowing
what it's telling him.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.835
Okay.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.839
So, it looks like he lost the scent.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.799
Exactly. That's gonna happen.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.803
Now you need to just gently help him
find it again. You know?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.514
Don't push him in any kind of direction
or rush him.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.598
Okay.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.226
All right, Hooch. It's all good, bro.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.604
You do what you wanna do.
Take your time, bud.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
See?
-Whoa!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.025
-Wow.
You found me.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.860
That's it. Just supporting him.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.154
Nice job, Hooch.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.866
Okay. One minute and 17 seconds!

19:17.949 --> 19:19.784
-See, he's great at this.
-Wow.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.453
And his owner's not so bad either.

19:21.536 --> 19:22.579
Well, thank you.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.456
Good boy.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.085
Hey, Trent. Wait up. It's, uh, me, Animal.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.629
Yeah, we're gonna need to rethink
that call sign.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.340
I'm thinking "Squeaker."

19:33.423 --> 19:34.841
-Oh, okay.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.553
Anyway, I took your advice and I talked to
a K-9 expert about what we did wrong.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.722
Next time Krista pops up,
we're gonna be ready.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.349
If there's a next time.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.143
No, Krista's not gonna leave town
until she makes her play.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.729
In Boston,
she watched a Sotheby's for months.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.814
Made four attempts
before she got what she came for.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.400
Nice. What are you, Wikipedia?

19:52.484 --> 19:54.611
That's not all.
There's something I wanna show you.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.572
-All right.
-Krista St. Jean's never been caught.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.575
But an undercover ATF agent
got close six months ago.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.453
<i>Fat Eddie said you can get me some Semtex.
Think you can get me a kilo?</i>

20:03.536 --> 20:05.163
<i>Yeah, a kilo. I got that.</i>

20:05.246 --> 20:08.291
<i>M4 and plastic explosives.
Heavy stuff for a pretty girl like you.</i>

20:08.375 --> 20:09.376
<i>What you planning?</i>

20:09.459 --> 20:13.088
<i>You think I'm pretty? That's nice.
I think you ask too many questions.</i>

20:14.172 --> 20:15.965
-Oh! Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.050
She bugged out.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.718
They lost her,

20:18.802 --> 20:21.137
She was probably shopping for this heist.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.099
-Explosives, automatic weapons.
-Hard core.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.267
-Nice work.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.520
Go for Trent.

20:31.314 --> 20:34.067
Booyah. Lock and load, boys.
St. Jean's on the move.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.151
We roll in five!

20:35.235 --> 20:36.444
We roll in five!

20:37.028 --> 20:38.029
Sorry.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.197
Come on, Hooch.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.865
Nah, I'm good.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.701
Seriously, you should come with us.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.744
Mm-mmm. Sorry, bud.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.455
Gotta figure out
what the baby wants me to eat for lunch.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.792
Sweet? Savory? Both? Smart kid.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.461
Krista St. Jean is downtown right now.
Okay?

20:53.545 --> 20:56.881
-I've been working with Hooch and think--
-I'm not doubting you and Hooch.

20:58.883 --> 21:02.178
Believe it or not, back in the day,
I wanted to be part of the T-Squad.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.807
But X took me aside

21:06.391 --> 21:09.310
You can't see the bandits
if you're looking in the mirror.

21:09.978 --> 21:10.979
-Well--
Turner.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.231
Planning your next book club meeting?
Let's go.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.442
Yeah, let's go. "Let's go" is right.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.526
-Come on.
-Go.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.403
Should we start a book club?

21:18.486 --> 21:19.946
I'm not against it.

21:20.030 --> 21:24.325
Okay, so the SFPD got a hit
on Krista right here only an hour ago.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.077
The trade show is three blocks away.

21:26.578 --> 21:30.373
It's weird she would just walk out
here. She's gotta know we're stalking her.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.752
Well, you said it yourself.
She's not leaving until she makes a play.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.253
All right, Hooch.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.380
Have a sniff of this, buddy.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.300
Go get Krista, bud. Go get her.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.885
We gonna raid another pet store?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.387
No, no, no, no. Rookie's got it this time.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.972
-Don't ya, rook?
-100%.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.599
-There it is.
-<i>Uno percento.</i>

21:48.600 --> 21:49.851
Give it a second.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.102
Stand by.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.230
Couple more seconds.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.524
-Bam. We're on the move.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.942
Yeah, let's move.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.378
Good job, bud.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.713
Pull this off,
we'll get you some shades too.

22:18.797 --> 22:22.592
He's, uh, following the cone of scent.
Air currents affect the distribution of--

22:22.676 --> 22:25.095
Not looking for a TED Talk,
just looking for Krista St. Jean.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.263
For sure.
TED Talks are the worst.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.640
Some TED Talks are sick.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.308
Yeah, for sure. Super informative.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.233
What? We're back where we started.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.317
What's going on here?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.652
We just went in a circle.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.570
Is this part of the whole
snow cone thingy?

22:42.654 --> 22:44.406
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I just got to, um...

22:44.489 --> 22:45.907
Hey, Hooch. You remember this?

22:45.990 --> 22:47.367
You're supported.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.285
Come on. Come on.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.371
-Just give it a minute.
-Weak sauce, Turner.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.915
Time for you and the dog
to head back to the office.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.500
Okay. All right, listen up.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.085
We know what she looks like.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.129
Let's get out there and find her.
Let's go.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.797
You heard the T-Man.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.881
You gotta earn these.

23:02.924 --> 23:03.925
I-I-I bought them.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.722
Then I'll give 'em back.
But just know that I'm not happy about it.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.478
Thanks a lot.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.149
Yo.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.358
X.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.193
-Whew, you're fast.
-Hey.

23:22.277 --> 23:25.238
Uh, yeah, I got a favor to ask.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.740
-Mm-hmm?
-It's Turner.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.951
-He's having a rough week. Trent problems.
-Mmm.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.954
But I'm not sure what to do.
Got any ideas?

23:33.538 --> 23:34.873
You know, when I was in Iraq,

23:34.956 --> 23:39.294
I used to take guys in my platoon who were
having trouble out on easy missions.

23:39.377 --> 23:42.005
Just, you know, go secure
a sand dune or something, you know?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.423
Build up their confidence.

23:43.506 --> 23:47.844
Hmm. I like it.
So just, like, give him a ground ball.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.263
Ground ball. How you mean?

23:50.347 --> 23:54.225
You--
You know, like, in baseball. Ground ball?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.853
-Never mind. I like your--
-Shh.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.189
You--

24:01.274 --> 24:02.275
Turner.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.987
Are you available to, uh, go after
an escaped prisoner with me?

24:09.282 --> 24:10.367
I could use the help.

24:15.163 --> 24:18.500
You, uh... You need help with
a 70-year-old check-forger

24:18.583 --> 24:20.502
who walked off a federal prison camp?

24:21.628 --> 24:25.507
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I think you'll be fine.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.803
You gotta wax your own board.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.599
I get it.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.525
-Yo. Yeah, what's up? Baxter here.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.943
There's no one on that phone.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.194
I know what you're up to.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.738
Can I just process my failure
for a minute?

24:48.822 --> 24:50.782
Just, like, stew in my misery?

24:50.865 --> 24:53.576
I'll let you stew away.
I was just trying to help.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.744
Thank you.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.055
You're making it very hard to process.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.981
So, fugitive tracking didn't go so well.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.065
Terrible.

25:24.149 --> 25:24.983
Aw.

25:25.066 --> 25:27.027
I did everything right, you know,
and he just--

25:27.110 --> 25:28.611
He went around in a big circle

25:28.695 --> 25:31.072
and then sat down
right on the curb where we started.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.033
Maybe that's where her scent
was the strongest.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.117
Doesn't matter.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.660
I'm off the St. Jean case.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.829
I actually came about the toy.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.497
-He's a monster.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.792
He's squeaking it day and night.
It's like he's trying to drive me crazy.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.795
Don't take it personally.
It's just a dog thing, really.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.839
And the squeak, it reminds them of prey.

25:48.590 --> 25:53.261
You-- You're saying that he delights
in the squeaky cries of his victims

25:53.345 --> 25:55.221
and he's not a monster?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.557
Just-- Okay.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.310
Maybe Hooch is a tiny bit of a monster,

26:00.393 --> 26:03.104
but you can't change his instincts.

26:03.188 --> 26:07.025
You can, however, replace his toy

26:08.151 --> 26:10.445
with something
that has a less annoying squeak.

26:11.863 --> 26:15.033
Try subbing it in while he's
eating dinner and not focusing on it.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.621
That's so much less offensive.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.247
-Listen to that.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.582
Oh, good? It's a good--

26:22.665 --> 26:24.042
-This is like...
-Okay.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.752
It's like Mozart.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.589
Just like that concerto.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.132
Yeah. Thank you.

26:31.216 --> 26:35.220
-Ah, what would I do without you?
-I don't know. You'd probably die.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.472
Just kidding.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.391
You-- You wouldn't die. You'd be fine.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.312
Try the new toy. Let me know how it goes.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.861
Squeak. Squeak.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.406
This squeaky toy's hilarious.

26:54.489 --> 26:58.410
Make sure Hooch enjoys it while it lasts
'cause it's going away very soon.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.912
Guys, I think we finished another volcano.

27:01.413 --> 27:02.455
-Yeah.
-You wanna see?

27:03.081 --> 27:05.125
I think Grandpa
would have been very proud.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.543
Looks great.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.629
I'll add Lego villagers
to run screaming from the lava.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.298
Good. Hooch already started
picking out the lucky villagers.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.509
-And we'll clean up, okay?
Okay.

27:16.636 --> 27:19.097
Is that, uh, for your vet tech exam?

27:19.180 --> 27:20.181
How's that going?

27:20.265 --> 27:21.808
Oh. It's-- It's not.

27:21.891 --> 27:24.352
I have no time to study
between Matthew and work

27:24.436 --> 27:26.312
and watching this dancing pig on TikTok.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.273
Laura, it's been a year. Come on.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.816
Yeah, a crazy year.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.152
It's not like I have to be a vet tech
to help Mom at the clinic.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.739
No. You just need a degree
to actually treat animals

27:35.822 --> 27:37.574
like you've wanted to do forever.

27:39.367 --> 27:42.078
So, um, did you look into Dad's case more?

27:42.162 --> 27:45.165
Not a case. Um, but yeah, sort of.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.833
I, uh, looked into Wyatt Tolliver.

27:46.916 --> 27:50.045
He's registered
at the Tall Oaks Trailer Park.

27:50.128 --> 27:51.379
Doesn't say which trailer, but--

27:51.463 --> 27:54.424
Great. That's just outside of town.
We could drive over and talk to him.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.925
Hold on. I don't think you--

27:56.009 --> 27:58.887
Scotty, this is our case.
Please don't shut me out of this.

28:04.392 --> 28:09.606
I was just sacrificing villagers
to the volcano, and Hooch went nuts.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.358
It only took him seconds this time!

28:11.441 --> 28:13.651
You destroyed another one?

28:13.735 --> 28:16.279
-This is not something to celebrate.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.039
Mmm.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.874
A whole can of fancy food.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.085
Eat up, buddy.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.461
Yeah.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.463
That's so exciting, right, boy?

28:33.963 --> 28:36.508
Oh, my dear. Look at this!

28:36.591 --> 28:37.884
It's cool, right?

28:38.510 --> 28:40.136
I heard it was from Angel.

28:40.637 --> 28:41.513
Yeah!

28:42.722 --> 28:44.015
Yeah.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.729
Aw, come on. You didn't even try it!

28:59.698 --> 29:01.074
Please.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.162
It's huge.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.133
Hey, bud.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.343
Look what I got.

29:20.427 --> 29:22.762
Look, it's your toy.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.682
-Want that? Yeah?

29:30.812 --> 29:31.813
Okay.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.107
Fine, you win.

29:35.233 --> 29:36.359
I'll fix it.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.661
-That the, um, check-forger?
Let's go.

29:46.745 --> 29:49.622
Yeah. It turns out he was hiding
at this arsonist's place.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.792
And this guy was on
the FBI's most wanted list.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.587
Chased him through a train yard
as the sun was rising.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.298
It was magical.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.342
How's it looking with Trent?

30:00.425 --> 30:01.885
You guys gonna partner up?

30:01.968 --> 30:03.720
It's not looking good.

30:04.512 --> 30:05.513
Congrats.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.190
Stay. Please stay.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.108
Hooch is breaking me.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.236
-I'm broken.
-Oh, I can relate to that.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.365
This bump was kickboxing
my kidneys all night.

30:24.282 --> 30:27.118
Well, whatever that briefing is,
I guess I'm not invited.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.164
Hooch won't be happy
until I am a sleepless zombie

30:31.247 --> 30:33.249
assigned to washing cars
in the parking garage.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.793
Don't even worry about it.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.628
You're definitely not missing much.

30:37.295 --> 30:38.922
"Hey, Chief.

30:39.005 --> 30:42.175
Me and the T-Squad
are gonna get matching haircuts."

30:42.258 --> 30:44.469
"Oh, great idea, Trent.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.554
Loop me in on the after-action report."

30:46.638 --> 30:48.056
"On it, Chief.

30:48.139 --> 30:49.516
Hey, your boots are dirty.

30:50.016 --> 30:52.018
Want a spit shine from the T-Man?"

30:53.478 --> 30:54.479
You're good at that.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.605
Think that sums it up.

30:56.189 --> 30:58.733
Go for Trent.
Here it is. We're locked and loaded.

30:58.817 --> 31:02.070
Krista St. Jean
was just spotted again downtown.

31:02.153 --> 31:06.324
We are closing the net.
We need every available deputy...

31:08.827 --> 31:10.161
-Hey.
You, let's go.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.414
-Move on it. Let's go.
Um...

31:12.497 --> 31:13.915
-Time to roll.
Move.

31:13.998 --> 31:14.999
Sorry, brah.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.293
Maybe you and the dog should...

31:17.377 --> 31:18.378
Because--

31:18.461 --> 31:21.423
I-I can't. You know what? Thank you.
I have so much paperwork.

31:21.506 --> 31:23.508
-It'd be weird if I came.
-Good. Have fun with that.

31:23.591 --> 31:24.884
-Let's move! Go, go, go.
-All right.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.261
Go, go, go.

31:27.887 --> 31:28.888
Are you happy?

31:29.681 --> 31:33.518
I know it doesn't feel like it,
but I think Hooch did you a favor.

31:33.601 --> 31:36.396
At least now you know
how to steer clear of the T-Squad.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.064
Mmm.

31:38.648 --> 31:41.443
Hey, are those stitches?
What happened to Hooch's fishy?

31:41.526 --> 31:45.447
Oh, I, um... I tried to replace the squeaker
without him noticing.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.699
-He noticed.
-Come on, man.

31:47.782 --> 31:50.493
You know Hooch isn't gonna fall for
an impostor.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.620
He's way too smart for that.

31:53.705 --> 31:54.706
Right?

31:56.916 --> 31:58.960
Yoo-hoo. Hello.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.086
You freeze?

32:00.170 --> 32:01.296
Should I reboot you?

32:01.379 --> 32:03.381
I was just thinking about
what you just said.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.259
About Hooch not being fooled
by an impostor.

32:07.677 --> 32:09.220
-Come over here for a second?
-Okay.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.097
Something's been bugging me. Um...

32:12.098 --> 32:14.684
Look at this footage of Krista
checking out of the hotel.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.686
-You can see her perfectly, right?
-Yeah.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.481
But on the other security cameras,
the ones on the street,

32:19.564 --> 32:22.609
same cap, same jacket,
but we never see her face.

32:22.692 --> 32:25.695
So? She's avoiding the cameras.
She's been doing this for a decade.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.781
But then why show her face at the hotel?

32:28.740 --> 32:29.949
I'm gonna check something.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.416
Hi, Scott. Hey, what's up?

32:38.500 --> 32:41.044
I have a quick, important question
if you have a second.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.046
Oh, yeah. All the secs-- seconds.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.715
If someone else
was wearing the fugitive's clothes,

32:45.799 --> 32:48.093
could that be why Hooch lost the trail?

32:48.176 --> 32:51.680
I've never heard of anything like that.
But sure, yeah.

32:51.763 --> 32:54.224
That would definitely explain
why the scent faded.

32:55.392 --> 32:56.518
And that second time,

32:56.601 --> 32:58.937
if Krista swapped clothes with someone
and then drove away--

32:59.020 --> 33:00.814
Hooch woulda tracked her
until she got into the car.

33:00.897 --> 33:03.983
-Yes!
-Oh, that's amazing. Thank you.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.236
-Yeah, anytime.
-Thank you.

33:06.319 --> 33:09.364
Krista's got every deputy in town
looking around the trade show.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.824
Yeah. Why?

33:10.907 --> 33:13.368
-I got an idea. Gonna make a couple calls.
Me too.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.955
-Go for Trent.
<i>It's Scott. I need to talk.</i>

33:17.038 --> 33:18.373
I'm in the middle of something.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.292
Just listen. Jessica and I
have been doing some digging.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.420
We think we know
where Krista's gonna strike.

33:23.503 --> 33:25.588
I don't have time for belly rubs.
Trade show's about to start.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.799
I know, but the jewels aren't there yet.

33:27.882 --> 33:30.885
They arrive at
the Hayward Executive Airport today.

33:30.969 --> 33:32.887
Bro, Krista's in San Francisco.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.974
We've seen footage
from cameras in the area. She's here.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.935
You don't understand.
I talked to Erica at the training center--

33:39.019 --> 33:40.020
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

33:40.103 --> 33:43.148
Wanna take your dog to the airport,
sniff around. Fine. Do it.

33:43.231 --> 33:44.315
T-Man out.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.318
Let's hope we're right.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.742
Hey, can I help you folks?

33:53.825 --> 33:54.951
US Marshals.

33:55.035 --> 33:57.037
We're here about
the Golden State Trade Show shipment.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.873
Whoa, marshals.
I don't see a lot of those.

34:00.457 --> 34:03.460
Had some DEA guys once and an ATF fella.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.253
That was interesting.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.465
We're kind of in a rush.
Any idea when the shipment's flying in?

34:10.216 --> 34:12.260
Already landed. That's them there.

34:13.178 --> 34:14.679
My cousin Dave is a marshal.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.766
Do you know him? Supercool guy.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.684
Um, think he may be retired now.

34:19.768 --> 34:22.520
-If the shipment's already here...
-Maybe he's even a postman.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.482
-Thought about joining the Marshals.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.525
It's Krista. Hooch smells her.
She's close.

34:27.609 --> 34:29.152
-Go, Hooch. Seek.

34:29.235 --> 34:32.197
Call the police. Tell them we've got
an armed and dangerous fugitive here.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.490
We need backup immediately.

34:33.573 --> 34:35.742
O-O-Okay. I-I-I-I'm on it.

34:38.578 --> 34:39.954
What'd I just say about calling?

34:40.038 --> 34:43.708
Trent, you don't understand.
Hooch tracked Krista's scent. She's here.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.586
Negative, Turner. I'm about to
grab her now. Stop calling me.

34:48.963 --> 34:49.923
Go, go, go, go.

34:50.006 --> 34:52.384
-US Marshals! On the ground!
-Get on the ground now!

34:53.760 --> 34:56.554
Krista St. Jean, you're under arrest.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.807
Who's Krista St. Jean?

34:58.890 --> 35:00.475
This is a mistake.

35:00.558 --> 35:03.061
What? Who-- Who are you?
What are you doing here?

35:03.144 --> 35:05.730
Some lady paid me $300
to walk around in her clothes.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.732
She said it was some kind of joke.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.402
-No. No, no, no. There's no way.
-I swear.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.570
She said some guys would meet me.
She gave me this.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.156
Easy. Slow, slow.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.832
What?

35:31.381 --> 35:32.799
Look, you should hang back.

35:33.591 --> 35:34.718
If she's really here...

35:34.801 --> 35:37.053
Then you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.668
Grab the diamonds!

36:11.087 --> 36:12.088
We doing this?

36:12.172 --> 36:13.173
Let's do it.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.884
US Marshals! Freeze!

36:27.604 --> 36:28.980
Grab the rest! Let's go!

36:56.132 --> 36:57.759
-She's running!
Go after her.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.935
Where is she, Hooch? Where is she?

37:10.313 --> 37:12.107
In there? Is she in there, boy?

37:15.026 --> 37:16.319
Quiet, boy.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.335
This is bad, Hooch. She's got us pinned.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.963
Should have stayed with your friends
across the bay.

37:35.046 --> 37:36.673
Now you're gonna die.

37:37.173 --> 37:38.675
In Hayward.

37:43.471 --> 37:44.931
Hey, hey.

37:45.015 --> 37:46.016
You like your fishy?

37:46.099 --> 37:48.476
I need you to squeak for our lives.
All right?

37:59.654 --> 38:00.947
Don't move.

38:01.531 --> 38:02.365
Don't move.

38:07.162 --> 38:08.747
Good job, Hooch.

38:08.830 --> 38:12.500
I stayed ahead of the marshals
for ten years--

38:12.584 --> 38:15.253
Nine years, 11 months. But who's counting?

38:17.756 --> 38:18.882
What's your name?

38:19.966 --> 38:23.303
-I wanna know who finally caught me.

38:23.386 --> 38:25.638
You got it. You just got caught by--

38:25.722 --> 38:27.682
<i>This is Trent Havelock of the US Marshals.</i>

38:27.766 --> 38:31.102
Put your weapons down
and come out with your hands up.

38:42.489 --> 38:43.698
It's so weird.

38:43.782 --> 38:46.659
Hooch lost interest in his toy
right after we arrested Krista.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.787
Oh, this day was full of surprises.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.955
-Oh, I, uh, talked to the chief.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.541
He wants us
at the press conference tomorrow.

38:55.210 --> 38:57.921
Is this some kind of "I told you so"
about working with Trent?

38:58.505 --> 38:59.964
-No.

39:00.048 --> 39:01.132
Maybe a little.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.677
-Yeah.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.761
What is it, boy?

39:07.347 --> 39:09.933
-Oh, my goodness. I heard what happened.

39:10.016 --> 39:11.434
-Hey.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.560
Oh.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.232
-Sorry.
-Hey.

39:17.315 --> 39:20.652
I was turning in my expenses,
and so we were here.

39:20.735 --> 39:23.238
-And then I heard that you were here.
-No problem.

39:23.321 --> 39:25.198
Angel was really worried about Hooch.

39:25.740 --> 39:27.117
She heard there was a shoot-out.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.452
Don't worry.
We're fine, Erica. Both of us.

39:30.036 --> 39:32.205
Yes! I'm happy you're okay too.

39:32.288 --> 39:34.332
-Oh.
-That's why I'm hugging both of you.

39:34.416 --> 39:37.127
I don't know.
I feel like Scott got most of my hug.

39:37.210 --> 39:38.253
But thanks.

39:38.336 --> 39:40.171
I will see you upstairs, Scott.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.965
-Yeah. All right.
Okay.

39:42.048 --> 39:43.675
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:45.010 --> 39:48.388
Hey, I, uh-- I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

39:48.471 --> 39:50.598
We never woulda caught Krista
without your help.

39:50.682 --> 39:54.060
Oh, no problem.
I mean, it's my job.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.062
Yeah, but I don't know.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.273
Something tells me
you're going above and beyond.

39:59.315 --> 40:00.900
Maybe a little bit.

40:01.484 --> 40:04.487
Yeah,
it's hard not to get personally involved--

40:05.405 --> 40:07.741
When it comes to work stuff.

40:07.824 --> 40:09.868
So you up for another run tomorrow?

40:09.951 --> 40:11.202
-Totally.
-Okay.

40:11.286 --> 40:14.748
Maybe a little less running
and more of a walk would be good?

40:15.290 --> 40:16.624
Yeah, okay.

40:16.708 --> 40:20.128
I'm really looking forward to it.
We are. Angel and I, I mean.

40:20.211 --> 40:21.838
Right, Angel?

40:21.921 --> 40:23.631
Great. Us too.

40:25.717 --> 40:26.968
Bye.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.053
Bye.

40:31.431 --> 40:35.310
Laura, if you're calling for help
with a third volcano, you're trippin'.

40:35.393 --> 40:38.813
Relax, you're off the hook volcano-wise.
Matthew has a new science project.

40:38.897 --> 40:41.399
How fast dog saliva
can dissolve papier-mâché.

40:41.483 --> 40:44.402
-Oh, okay.
<i>So, you know that Wyatt guy?</i>

40:44.486 --> 40:46.154
The criminal from Dad's file.

40:46.237 --> 40:47.238
I found his trailer.

40:47.322 --> 40:49.783
<i>Now at first,
I didn't know which trailer was his.</i>

40:49.866 --> 40:51.368
Then I remembered there's a biker dude

40:51.451 --> 40:53.536
who brings his cockapoo
to the animal hospital,

40:53.620 --> 40:55.246
<i>and he knew where Wyatt lives.</i>

40:55.330 --> 40:57.082
So, here I am.

40:57.165 --> 40:59.084
Wait, what? You're there?

40:59.167 --> 41:00.919
No. Laura, you're gonna
talk to him yourself?

41:01.002 --> 41:02.295
<i>That's a bad idea.</i>

41:02.379 --> 41:04.089
Relax, I'm a people person.

41:04.172 --> 41:05.674
<i>You're a veterinary assistant.</i>

41:05.757 --> 41:08.301
What you gonna do if someone attacks you?
Put a cone on his neck?

41:08.385 --> 41:10.929
No, I'll be fine. Besides, you're busy.

41:11.012 --> 41:12.681
<i>I will make time. Just...</i>

41:12.764 --> 41:14.099
I'll-- I'll come tomorrow. Okay?

41:14.683 --> 41:16.184
Tomorrow? You promise?

41:16.267 --> 41:17.644
Yes, I promise.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.730
<i>Just please do not try to contact
this criminal</i>

41:20.814 --> 41:22.941
or any other criminal without me.

41:23.024 --> 41:25.193
Okay, fine. I promise.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:25.276 --> 41:26.778
<i>This guy is going down.</i>

41:26.861 --> 41:27.904
Okay.

41:38.081 --> 41:40.041
What's wrong? This is our big moment.

41:41.501 --> 41:43.712
So, I just talked to the chief.

41:44.212 --> 41:46.089
I'm officially on desk duty.

41:46.589 --> 41:50.427
Something about being this pregnant and
getting into three gunfights in a month.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.053
-Sucks.
-Yeah.

41:53.596 --> 41:59.602
Anyway, while I ride a desk,
I wanted you to have this.

41:59.686 --> 42:00.937
Saint Michael.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.356
Patron saint of law enforcement.

42:03.857 --> 42:05.900
Kept me safe since I was a rookie.

42:06.943 --> 42:10.155
You know,
now that I can't be there to protect you.

42:11.448 --> 42:12.449
Okay.

42:12.532 --> 42:14.993
But as soon as you're off desk duty,
I'm giving it back.

42:15.577 --> 42:16.578
Deal.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.878
I want to thank everybody
for coming out here today.

42:24.961 --> 42:27.756
I am Deputy Marshal Trent Havelock.

42:27.839 --> 42:31.551
And, as you know, it was my team
that took down Krista St. Jean.

42:32.135 --> 42:33.970
But today's not just about me. No.

42:34.054 --> 42:38.141
First of all, I want to thank the chief
for putting me in a position to succeed,

42:38.224 --> 42:41.311
and as always,
I gotta thank my boys for having my back.

42:41.394 --> 42:42.937
-T-Squad! Get up here.

42:43.021 --> 42:43.897
Come on, guys.

42:44.814 --> 42:47.275
And I also want to thank
the Special Ops Group.

42:48.068 --> 42:49.694
The Hayward PD. Come on up here.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.780
Share this with me.

42:51.863 --> 42:52.906
And logistical support.

42:52.989 --> 42:55.033
Get up here, guys.
Come on. We got lots of room.

42:55.116 --> 42:57.619
You guys did it.
Well done. You earned this.

42:57.702 --> 43:00.705
Oh, before I forget. There is one person
I really want to thank.

43:00.789 --> 43:03.249
Now, this person came up big
when we needed him most.

43:04.334 --> 43:07.045
The CHP chopper pilot
who flew me across the bay.

43:07.128 --> 43:08.630
Luke! Get up here, bro.

43:08.713 --> 43:09.923
What a guy. Thanks, bro.

43:11.966 --> 43:14.594
I think that wraps-- Oh, yeah. Right.

43:14.678 --> 43:16.888
Also want to shout-out Deputy Baxter,

43:16.971 --> 43:19.766
-the dog and the rookie.

43:19.849 --> 43:22.143
Wherever you are. I can't see them.

43:22.227 --> 43:26.231
Anyways, it takes a special deputy
to screw up as bad as you did

43:26.314 --> 43:28.024
and get back on that horse.

43:28.108 --> 43:30.318
-Way to go. Nice work.

43:30.402 --> 43:33.321
So, still wanna join the T-Squad?

43:33.822 --> 43:35.824
Who's got questions for me?
Trent! Trent!

43:35.907 --> 43:37.659
Yeah, that was me in the helicopter.

43:37.742 --> 43:40.620
I just knew the only way across the bay
that fast was a chopper, so...

43:40.704 --> 43:43.123
Hey. Don't be so down.

43:43.206 --> 43:45.250
Something like this happens to everybody.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.877
Takes a bit to find your place
as a deputy.

43:49.546 --> 43:51.589
Scott? Scott Turner.

43:52.799 --> 43:55.010
Wow. I thought that was you.

43:55.593 --> 43:57.220
Brooke! What are you doing here?

43:57.303 --> 44:01.057
Saw you up there onstage behind the flag.
Very impressive, Mr. Marshal.

44:01.141 --> 44:04.269
Thanks. I...
I thought you were in DC.

44:04.352 --> 44:06.271
I just transferred
to the US Attorney's office here.

44:07.313 --> 44:09.941
-Now we work in the same building.
-Great.

44:10.025 --> 44:11.484
Scott and I went out a few times.

44:12.152 --> 44:13.570
More than a few. We kinda--

44:13.653 --> 44:14.904
I work with Scott.

44:14.988 --> 44:15.989
I'm sorry.

44:16.072 --> 44:19.451
-Yes, this is Jessica. She's a deputy too.
-Mm-hmm.

44:19.534 --> 44:20.744
We work together.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.620
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

44:22.704 --> 44:23.788
And this is Hooch.

44:23.872 --> 44:26.958
Oh, you are such a handsome boy, Hooch.

44:27.667 --> 44:32.255
Well, I gotta run,
but maybe I'll see you around.

44:32.339 --> 44:33.506
Yeah.

44:37.635 --> 44:39.304
So that's her, huh?

44:39.387 --> 44:42.098
The ex you've been hung up on
for the past five years?

44:42.599 --> 44:43.767
I wouldn't say hung up.

44:44.309 --> 44:46.311
Not hung up? Look at you.

44:46.394 --> 44:48.772
Your eyes are coming out of your head.

44:48.855 --> 44:51.066
Are you even listening? Scott.

44:52.025 --> 44:53.026
Scott?
