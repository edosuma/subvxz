WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:11.033
This is what you missed
last week on Shameless.

00:13.433 --> 00:16.200
Well, just watch the screen.
You'll get it.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.166
I've been reading more about
this Purity Ball thing.

00:18.166 --> 00:20.100
You can rededicate yourself
as a virgin.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.500
Confess your transgressions.

00:23.367 --> 00:24.300
KAREN:
Oh, yeah.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.100
I'll give you
the damn car.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.500
You have to stand up to him,
Kash.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.433
(heavy breathing)

00:30.433 --> 00:33.100
Put it back... Now.
What are you doing?!

00:33.100 --> 00:34.567
It's a fucking
Snickers bar.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.233
Fuck!

00:38.233 --> 00:39.633
I bought her house.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.433
You'll be living with Steve in a
house he bought next door!

00:42.433 --> 00:43.533
Show me
the house?

00:43.533 --> 00:44.700
I like you, Fiona.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.133
You remember Steve?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.567
(passionate moaning)

00:47.567 --> 00:49.300
Yeah, how's it going?

00:49.300 --> 00:51.266
All I need
is your signature,

00:51.266 --> 00:52.567
and Monica's;

00:52.567 --> 00:54.200
and the money
is all yours.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.133
Monica's over
at Sheila's.
Who the
hell's Monica?

00:56.133 --> 00:58.767
Our mother.
Oh, my God!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.700
How 'bout Moni signs whatever
the hell it is you need,

01:00.700 --> 01:03.033
we get Liam.
Done.

01:03.033 --> 01:04.533
You don't get to abandon
your kids,

01:04.533 --> 01:07.400
and then show up one day to take
your pick of the litter!

01:07.400 --> 01:09.600
Roberta and I want to start
a family of our own.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.133
And you're here, now,

01:11.133 --> 01:12.700
so I'm done.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.100
So how long you plan on us
staying here playing house?

02:32.100 --> 02:34.467
Did you see
those kids' faces?

02:34.467 --> 02:36.467
Do you see the way
they looked at me?

02:36.467 --> 02:39.100
I'm not supporting
six kids.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.767
We get the DNA results
tomorrow.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.467
It'll prove
Liam's not Frank's.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.333
ROBERTA:
That way if the shithead
changes his mind,

02:44.333 --> 02:46.467
he can't ever try
and take Liam back.
MONICA: Quiet.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.533
Quiet.
They're sleeping.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.600
We are going to make
a great family, baby.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.500
I'm going to take care
of you and Liam

02:52.500 --> 02:54.633
like Frank never could.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.667
(giggling, murmuring)

02:56.667 --> 02:59.700
ROBERTA:
Possession is 9/10th's
of the law.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.767
(squealing in distance)

03:16.767 --> 03:19.300
FIONA:
It's so quiet.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.233
It's nice, right?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.166
Yeah.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.767
DEBBIE (over baby monitor):
It has to be E-6.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.667
It's the only spot left big
enough for a carrier.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.333
CARL:
No, it's not...

03:36.333 --> 03:40.200
(kids shouting)
Monica didn't even bother
to read to them or tuck them in.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.600
She probably forgot to use
Liam's ass cream, too.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.000
DEBBIE:
Yes, it is.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
You're cheating again!
CARL: No, I'm not!

03:47.000 --> 03:48.633
FIONA:
Carl, go back to your room.

03:48.633 --> 03:49.633
Debbie, go to sleep.

03:49.633 --> 03:51.100
School tomorrow.
We're almost done.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.633
You both brush your teeth?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.533
DEBBIE AND CARL:
Yes...!

03:54.533 --> 03:55.467
Carl?

03:55.467 --> 03:58.333
Go. Now.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.266
Night, Carl.

04:02.266 --> 04:04.367
Night, Fiona. Love you.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.166
Love you, Fiona.
FIONA:
Love you, too.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.033
And no reading
under the covers.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.367
(Debbie sighs)

04:25.633 --> 04:27.700
Monica,
Carl needs something from you.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.500
Here.
What? What's this?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.667
LIP:
Permission slip.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.300
Oh. You're going
to the aquarium!

04:33.300 --> 04:35.033
When?
CARL:
Today.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.633
I need ten dollars.
What for?

04:36.633 --> 04:38.266
Admission fee.

04:38.266 --> 04:39.500
School doesn't pay for that?
LIP:
No;

04:39.500 --> 04:42.333
and he'll need money for food.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.767
Grab him an instant oatmeal
and a Pop-Tart.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.734
Makes a great lunch.
Deb,

04:45.734 --> 04:47.567
what are you doing?
I'm looking

04:47.567 --> 04:48.734
for a poster board and markers.

04:48.734 --> 04:50.767
I'm running for re-election.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.066
Ian, could you help her?

04:53.066 --> 04:55.233
If you all would tell me
these things the night before,

04:55.233 --> 04:57.066
it would be a little better
in the morning.

04:57.066 --> 04:58.767
I need 40 bucks.
ROBERTA:
No.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.767
Bob, do you have
a five?

05:00.767 --> 05:02.166
In... in my wallet.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.133
Where it's gonna stay.
(murmurs)

05:04.133 --> 05:05.266
Look, I need a new calculus
textbook.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.066
I can get it used;
only costs 20.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.233
IAN:
Where are our lunches?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.100
Huh?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.667
Um...

05:15.133 --> 05:16.233
What is everybody looking at?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.567
Start spreading peanut butter
on bread.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.567
Right.

05:20.567 --> 05:21.600
So...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.000
Okay. Where's the jelly?

05:24.767 --> 05:27.533
(clamoring voices)

05:30.600 --> 05:31.633
Fucking Monica.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.200
She can barely cook an egg.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.467
She didn't even
make them lunches.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.033
Now she's got them
leaving for school late

05:36.033 --> 05:38.300
while that fat lesbian sits
on her ass doing nothing.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.000
All right.
It's freezing in here.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.533
Go over and help out.

05:43.533 --> 05:46.100
Fuck her!
She's
driving you crazy.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.266
I'm fine.
All right,
then it's driving me  crazy.

05:48.266 --> 05:51.066
Believe me, I'll be back
over there soon enough.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.433
You get any sleep last night?

05:53.433 --> 05:57.633
She left Carl at Oktoberfest
until November.

05:57.633 --> 06:00.367
This is a woman who burned
a hole in Liam's footie pajamas

06:00.367 --> 06:03.433
when she fell asleep smoking
while nursing.

06:03.433 --> 06:06.000
She came back.
She's a flake. Okay?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
She never called.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.333
She never came by.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.400
She never sent those kids
a fucking birthday card!

06:12.533 --> 06:14.100
Must've been hard
when she left.

06:15.233 --> 06:17.133
Destroyed the kids.
I meant you.

06:17.133 --> 06:20.000
(laughs)
I wept tears of joy.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.033
We need a couch.

06:21.033 --> 06:23.367
You should talk to a lawyer.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.433
(laughing)
Oh, right.

06:24.433 --> 06:25.633
I can't keep food
on the table,

06:25.633 --> 06:27.300
but I'm hiring a lawyer.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.400
Just to find out
what Monica can and can't do.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.133
Here, you know what?.
I gotta get to work.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.767
Hup! Catch!
Wha...?

06:33.767 --> 06:36.500
What's this?
Your own
cell phone.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.533
I told you I don't want you
buying me stuff.

06:38.533 --> 06:41.033
It's what couples do.
(clicks his tongue)

06:41.033 --> 06:42.133
Get us a couch.

06:48.266 --> 06:50.133
Okay. Um...

06:52.400 --> 06:54.133
Okay!

06:54.133 --> 06:55.200
Everyone...

06:58.467 --> 07:01.500
We won't be here
when you get home from school.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.700
Why?
What?

07:04.200 --> 07:05.567
Fiona always
tells us why.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.700
None of your damn business why.
Bob!

07:07.700 --> 07:10.200
Your mother told you to go,
so go!

07:10.200 --> 07:12.300
MONICA:
Out.
Go on, guys.
I'll catch up.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.166
Bye. Bye.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.767
(Liam and Roberta giggle)

07:21.767 --> 07:25.166
I don't care
what the fucking DNA test says.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.133
You're not taking Liam.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.500
(scoffs)
We'll see about that.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.533
Yeah, we will.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.633
We having a problem,

07:32.633 --> 07:35.300
Phillip?!

07:35.300 --> 07:36.500
I dunno... Bob!

07:36.500 --> 07:39.033
Let's see.
You're camped out in my house,

07:39.033 --> 07:40.266
you're fucking my mother,

07:40.266 --> 07:42.100
and you're talking about
stealing my baby brother.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.333
Why would we have a problem?

07:43.333 --> 07:45.066
Boy, I will kick your...
Stop it! Hey!

07:45.066 --> 07:47.266
And congratulations, Mom.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.066
You always knew how to pick 'em.

07:49.066 --> 07:49.734
MONICA:
Lip!

07:54.166 --> 07:56.033
Lip!

07:56.033 --> 07:57.567
Lip!

07:57.567 --> 08:00.033
Please stop!

08:00.033 --> 08:01.233
Please!

08:02.600 --> 08:04.033
We haven't had
a chance to talk.

08:04.033 --> 08:05.200
Don't worry about it.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.066
No, I do.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.600
I... Oh, geez.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.700
I don't know where to start.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.433
How to explain.

08:13.433 --> 08:17.200
I worry about you.
(panting)

08:17.200 --> 08:20.266
I think about you
all the time.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.367
I miss you.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.233
There's so much
I want to ask you.

08:24.233 --> 08:25.567
How's school?

08:27.500 --> 08:30.667
You were always
so smart.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.266
My Lip.

08:33.266 --> 08:37.033
I know
you can do anything.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.633
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.233
(sobbing):
Oh, look at me.

08:52.367 --> 08:55.033
Next time you're thinking about
dropping in,

08:55.033 --> 08:57.467
don't.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.300
You've fucked up our lives
enough already.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.500
Touched By An Angel  marathon

09:09.500 --> 09:11.133
on the Hallmark Channel
this weekend.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.367
Ooh, I always
liked that one.
Mm-hmm.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.500
Except the Irish lady.
She's weird.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.333
Gunsmoke  marathon on TBS, too.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.700
Think we could get it painted?

09:21.333 --> 09:24.400
The car.
Anything you want,
Princess.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.166
I am just so proud of you
for deciding to go to

09:27.166 --> 09:29.133
the Purity Ball
and letting me protect you

09:29.133 --> 09:31.133
the way Jesus intended, huh?

09:31.133 --> 09:33.066
Have fun at
school, sweetie.
Bye, Mom.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.133
Oh!

09:35.200 --> 09:37.000
Frank.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.300
I made Belgian crepes
with raspberries,

09:39.300 --> 09:41.467
and there's a little
maple syrup for you.

09:41.467 --> 09:42.500
Uh, can't. I'm late.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.734
Where you going?

09:43.734 --> 09:45.333
I told you.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.700
I'm picking up Monica, going
to the city clerk's office,

09:47.700 --> 09:49.567
signing the settlement
and getting the money.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.300
So... Monica?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.500
Yes, Monica.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.066
You want me
to get the money, don't you?

09:56.066 --> 09:57.233
Is that the only reason?

09:57.233 --> 09:59.400
Yes.
Frank?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.266
Are you coming home
for dinner?

10:01.266 --> 10:02.300
Absolutely.
You sure?

10:02.300 --> 10:03.467
Yes, Yes. I'm late.

10:03.467 --> 10:04.567
I'm late.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.700
(car engine starts)

10:27.100 --> 10:28.667
Fuck.

10:35.066 --> 10:37.734
Thank God
we're leaving tomorrow.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.734
I don't
think I can.
Yes, you can.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.100
These kids need me.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.633
They're fine.

10:42.633 --> 10:45.266
You didn't see Lip?
How brokenhearted he was?

10:45.266 --> 10:47.367
Oh, honey, he'll
get over it.

10:47.367 --> 10:50.133
We can't take Liam from
his brothers and sisters.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.533
He's coming with us.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.133
No. The universe is
giving me a sign.

10:54.133 --> 10:57.166
An opportunity to be the mother
I never could be.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.200
I always felt guilty
about leaving those kids.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.567
I'm...

11:00.567 --> 11:02.767
I'm-I'm better now.
I think I can handle it.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.100
Yeah.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.033
Look at me.

11:10.033 --> 11:13.000
Monica!
Look... Uh-uh.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.066
Look at me.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.467
When we met, you were
like a beaten dog,

11:18.467 --> 11:20.200
barely hanging
on by a thread.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.233
I am stronger now.

11:22.233 --> 11:26.000
But for how long if
we stay here, baby?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.266
For how long, hmm?

11:28.266 --> 11:30.467
(laughs)

11:30.467 --> 11:32.500
We're getting the
DNA results, then

11:32.500 --> 11:34.633
we're leaving
with Liam.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.633
Oh-ho.

11:39.633 --> 11:43.000
I hope I'm not interrupting
a pajama party, Moni.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.734
That's what you ladies do
when you're together, right?

11:44.734 --> 11:46.233
Pillow fights
and the like?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.166
You wish you had a dick

11:48.166 --> 11:49.600
as big as mine.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.300
I am a man
of ample girth

11:51.300 --> 11:52.433
and length.

11:52.433 --> 11:54.367
(snorts)
Ask Moni.

11:54.367 --> 11:58.433
If I seem unimpressive in
my Wranglers, it's because

11:58.433 --> 12:00.734
I'm a grower, not a shower.

12:00.734 --> 12:04.300
But trust me,
when it's time to show, I grow.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.200
Come on, Mrs. G.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.533
Let's hit the road.

12:07.533 --> 12:10.400
Frankie's got some moolah
coming his way.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.567
Change of plans, Frankie.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.133
Monica's not signing
those papers

12:15.133 --> 12:16.734
until you get Lip, Fiona and

12:16.734 --> 12:19.333
the kids on board
with us taking Liam.

12:19.333 --> 12:23.133
What?
Monica needs to know that the
kids aren't going to hate her.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.300
It's too late.
They already hate her.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.567
Don't push it, Frank.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.133
We could be asking

12:27.133 --> 12:29.734
for the spousal support and
half the settlement money.

12:32.033 --> 12:34.233
Fine.

12:34.233 --> 12:36.200
Where's Fiona?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.400
MONICA:
Next door.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.367
She moved in with Steve.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.433
Who the fuck is Steve?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.734
Oh, God...

13:05.567 --> 13:08.433
That time of the year again,
Jasper?

13:08.433 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, just like
Christmas, Frank.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.433
I know you've
been naughty.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.500
Stop following me.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
Got my camcorder right here.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.600
Just a matter of time
before I catch you.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.734
Fuck off.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.433
How's Mickey doing?

13:32.433 --> 13:35.333
They still have him at
the jail ward over at County.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.166
You been over
to visit him?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.467
Nah.

13:38.467 --> 13:41.667
Those dyke guards pat you down
like amateur gynecologists.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.266
How's Kash?

13:45.266 --> 13:48.367
Couple of the Neighborhood
Watch ladies came by the store,

13:48.367 --> 13:51.133
offered to throw him a parade.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.700
Hmm.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.433
Kash had better move
his family back to Baghdad

13:55.433 --> 13:57.266
before Mickey gets out.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.000
He's from Evanston.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.033
Won't be nearly
far enough.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.767
Mandy...

14:03.767 --> 14:05.333
Lip.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.567
It's a nice outfit.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.633
What is that--
uh, pirate wench?

14:08.633 --> 14:10.633
You like?

14:10.633 --> 14:13.100
What's your third period?

14:13.100 --> 14:14.734
Health.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.367
Why?

14:16.367 --> 14:19.133
Think we need
to miss some school.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.367
See you.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.233
Tony?

14:29.233 --> 14:31.100
Somebody bought
Mr. Harris' house?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.133
Windows aren't
boarded up anymore.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.133
Yeah. Somebody did.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.533
Who?

14:38.533 --> 14:40.533
Steve.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.667
Yeah.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.333
Hope he can get the smell out.

14:47.333 --> 14:52.000
Harris was dead on the toilet
a long time before we found him.

14:56.066 --> 14:58.000
What was that about?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.400
Come on.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.166
You're good?
Shit!

15:05.166 --> 15:07.000
Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.300
Stop it! Ow!
I got it.
I got it.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.533
Okay, girl power.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.767
And down, down, down,
down, down, down, down.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.066
Oh.
Oh. Oh, sorry.

15:15.066 --> 15:16.367
FRANK:
Nice couch.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.500
What the hell, Frank?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.700
Steve needs

15:18.700 --> 15:20.166
new locks.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.767
You broke in?
Living with

15:21.767 --> 15:23.000
the boyfriend.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.567
What?
She won't sign

15:24.567 --> 15:27.200
my settlement until you
and the kids stop harassing her

15:27.200 --> 15:29.166
over Liam.
We're not harassing her.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.567
The boy needs
to be with his mother.

15:31.567 --> 15:35.033
He is  with his mother till
she decides to take off again.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.567
You obviously don't care.

15:37.567 --> 15:41.066
You've moved into
this love nest.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.200
I didn't move.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.166
I'm staying here
until your wife fucks up.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.567
What your mother
and I decide to do

15:46.567 --> 15:50.567
with our son Liam is
our business, Fiona,

15:50.567 --> 15:52.633
not yours.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.300
I am getting that money!

16:05.400 --> 16:07.533
So?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.667
I think he might be serious.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.767
Hey, Frank.
Fuck!

16:15.767 --> 16:19.033
Yo, Frank.

16:19.033 --> 16:22.000
Sheila called and "is making
your favorite dinner--

16:22.000 --> 16:23.333
pot roast."

16:23.333 --> 16:25.400
Sheila's making
you pot roast?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.600
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.300
Oh, and hey, that Jasper guy
was hanging around again,

16:29.300 --> 16:30.467
asking questions about you.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.066
Aah!
Wanted to know
how you felt.

16:32.066 --> 16:34.600
If you were back to work,
that sort of thing.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.400
Fucking disability guy.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.033
He's outside right now.

16:38.033 --> 16:39.734
Been following me
around all morning.

16:39.734 --> 16:41.700
I told him you were training

16:41.700 --> 16:43.066
for a marathon.

16:43.066 --> 16:44.300
Every year that shithead

16:44.300 --> 16:47.033
tries to trip me up,
stop my disability check.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.700
I finally get
some luck,

16:49.700 --> 16:52.400
and this douche with a
video cam has to show up.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.667
You don't have any luck.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.567
Hello!

16:55.567 --> 16:57.633
Settlement money. Thank you.

16:57.633 --> 16:59.367
If I can get

16:59.367 --> 17:01.367
Monica away from
Rosie Greer long enough

17:01.367 --> 17:03.233
to sign the
goddamn thing!

17:03.233 --> 17:05.567
Yeah, well, my guess-- Bob won't
let Monica out of her sight.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.133
She did look beautiful, though,
didn't she?

17:08.133 --> 17:10.133
Really keeping herself up.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.166
Uh-huh.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.166
Yeah, what about, uh,

17:14.166 --> 17:16.133
Sheila and the pot roast?

17:16.133 --> 17:17.367
(laughs)

17:17.367 --> 17:19.567
She's like mouth
herpes-- the gift

17:19.567 --> 17:21.100
that keeps on giving.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.667
No. Monica is my soul mate.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.600
We just click.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.000
Two lesbians at home
and the promise of cash.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.767
Maybe your luck
has changed, Frank.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.734
Nah.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.367
(Tommy laughs)

17:34.367 --> 17:36.000
Nah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.433
What are we looking for?

17:37.433 --> 17:39.266
How to override parental rights.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.333
We thinking DCFS or attorneys?

17:41.333 --> 17:42.767
Attorneys.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.500
I should have done this
when I turned 18.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.700
Frank was so broken
after Monica left,

17:45.700 --> 17:47.133
he would have signed anything.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.367
Here's someone.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.100
Mark Rydell.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.767
He'll fight for you

17:51.767 --> 17:53.266
when you can't
fight for yourself.

17:53.266 --> 17:55.266
Asian cowboy? Don't think so.

17:55.266 --> 17:56.700
Oh, what about
that lady?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.700
The one that helped
get Carl and Debbie back

17:58.700 --> 18:02.000
when Frank locked them in
that car at Indian bingo.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.166
Micha Davis.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.033
Is this her?

18:05.033 --> 18:06.600
Looks like she just
shit in her pants.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.367
(laughing)
Keep looking.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.300
Ah.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.633
There's one.
Christine Dowling.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.233
Attractive,
professional...

18:14.233 --> 18:17.033
And she looks like she might
actually have a law degree.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.767
Let's call her.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.700
IAN:
Where'd you get the car?

18:21.700 --> 18:24.300
LIP:
Borrowed it from Steve.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.033
Been working with him a bit.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.433
Doing what?

18:28.433 --> 18:31.066
(sighs)

18:31.066 --> 18:33.300
Oh, better not
let Fiona find out about it,

18:33.300 --> 18:36.066
or she'll kill you... and him.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.567
You doing okay?

18:39.567 --> 18:42.767
Lot going on.

18:42.767 --> 18:45.500
Yeah. It's weird
having Monica back.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.100
Yeah. Yeah, that, too.

18:49.633 --> 18:52.000
What? Something else?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.533
It's kind of hard to explain.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.600
Try me.

18:58.734 --> 19:01.033
Mickey's gay,
and we're doing it.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.567
And Kash shot Mickey
because of me,

19:02.567 --> 19:05.400
but Mickey would rather go
to juvie than admit he's gay.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.767
So, I'm doing both
Kash and Mickey.

19:07.767 --> 19:11.133
Well, not so much Kash lately.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.200
But when Kash and me
were hot and heavy,

19:13.200 --> 19:14.467
Linda found out about it,

19:14.467 --> 19:16.467
and is blackmailing Kash
into having another kid.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.033
Holy shit.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.133
Yeah.

19:21.133 --> 19:24.500
IAN:
Here they come.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.667
I think I'm gonna
go see him today.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.734
Who? Kash?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.100
No. Mickey.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.633
He's in jail
awaiting sentencing.

19:40.367 --> 19:43.367
I want to know what
I have to do to adopt

19:43.367 --> 19:45.734
my toddler brother and possibly
my other siblings, as well,

19:45.734 --> 19:47.300
and raise them as my own.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.000
Are both your parents
still alive?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.367
Yes.
Incompetent?

19:50.367 --> 19:53.100
Very.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.166
Okay, well, you're
talking about

19:55.166 --> 19:57.567
vacating their parental
rights and becoming

19:57.567 --> 19:59.066
legal guardian of how many?

19:59.066 --> 20:00.033
Five.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.767
Oh, that's a lot of kids.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.367
You know,
the law's pretty strict

20:05.367 --> 20:06.500
regarding parental rights.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.567
You'd need
to prove incompetence.

20:08.567 --> 20:09.667
Do you have a case?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.000
How much time do you have?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.066
I have a folder.

20:12.066 --> 20:13.700
You got a folder. Okay.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.367
(clears throat)

20:17.367 --> 20:19.300
Well, it looks
like your mother...

20:19.300 --> 20:20.400
Monica.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.600
...Monica left a couple
of years ago?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.033
21 and a half months.

20:24.033 --> 20:25.266
Is she back now?

20:25.266 --> 20:26.500
Sort of.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.066
And your father,

20:28.066 --> 20:29.166
Frank Gallagher...

20:29.166 --> 20:30.467
Wow. He's a live one.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.467
Drinker?

20:37.500 --> 20:40.133
Yeah.

20:40.133 --> 20:43.500
Uh, do you make federal poverty
level wages for a family of six?

20:43.500 --> 20:44.667
How much is that?

20:44.667 --> 20:46.567
30 grand a year or so.

20:46.567 --> 20:47.667
(sputters)

20:50.333 --> 20:52.667
So you don't earn enough money
to support them,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.767
and we'd have to prove
your parents incompetent?

20:54.767 --> 20:57.533
Listen, I know it
bites the big one,

20:57.533 --> 20:59.066

Thank you.
Yeah.

bouncer at the Zebra Lounge.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.033
You're the mother.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.433
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.200
So, we find Frank today,

21:38.200 --> 21:40.467
tell him we'll sign
his settlement papers

21:40.467 --> 21:43.066
in exchange for him signing over
his parental rights.

21:43.066 --> 21:44.734
After that, there ain't

21:44.734 --> 21:46.734

Fiona can do about it.

21:46.734 --> 21:48.233

but we never met outside of

33:51.033 --> 33:53.400
our make-out sessions in
the rehearsal hall.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.133
I repeatedly let
him touch me

33:56.133 --> 34:01.100
on my breasts, through
my shirt and bra.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.700
And once, I felt his...

34:02.700 --> 34:05.533
his rod touch my leg.

34:05.533 --> 34:08.000
This is so embarrassing. I can't
believe I let him do this.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.033
I'm so sorry.
RANDY:
Thank you, Patty.

34:10.033 --> 34:12.033
I want to thank you for
your courage to confront

34:12.033 --> 34:13.433
your struggles with desire.

34:13.433 --> 34:15.333
Who's next?

34:15.333 --> 34:17.667
Elaine?

34:19.633 --> 34:21.567
Hi.

34:21.567 --> 34:23.300
My name is Elaine,

34:23.300 --> 34:26.400
and I only touched one...

34:26.400 --> 34:28.266
penis.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.300
Once.

34:30.300 --> 34:33.200
If I didn't, I was going
to get hit with a pipe.

34:33.200 --> 34:37.100
God, why did you let
my  daughter become a slave

34:37.100 --> 34:38.266
to the flesh?

34:38.266 --> 34:40.433
I was going to get
hit with a pipe!

34:44.200 --> 34:46.100
STEVE:
So the lawyer said

34:46.100 --> 34:47.166
there's nothing you can do?

34:47.166 --> 34:49.600
If we sue, it could backfire.
Make things worse.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.233
(knock at door)

34:53.400 --> 34:56.367
Jesus. This place still smells
like old man Harris.

34:56.367 --> 34:57.700
What did Monica want?

34:57.700 --> 34:59.433
She wants us to
come over for dinner.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.266
Some kind of
a family meeting.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.433
FIONA (scoffs):
Family?

35:02.433 --> 35:03.567
Fucking load of shit.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.266
You told her we know
Liam is Frank's?

35:05.266 --> 35:06.233
Yeah.

35:06.233 --> 35:08.433
(Fiona sighs)

35:08.433 --> 35:10.100
You have any pot?

35:10.100 --> 35:12.000
I think if I have
to go see Mom conscious,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.233
I might actually commit
a violent felony.
LIP:
That's the first time

35:14.233 --> 35:16.734
in a long time
I've heard you call her Mom.

35:16.734 --> 35:18.233
I did?

35:19.233 --> 35:20.300
I don't know

35:20.300 --> 35:22.033
if I ever really felt
like she was my mom.

35:22.033 --> 35:24.500
Ian and I got
our DNA tests done.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.166
FIONA:
Why?

35:27.166 --> 35:28.200
I don't know,
got excited

35:28.200 --> 35:30.400
at the idea
of not being Frank's, and

35:30.400 --> 35:31.633
if none of us
are his, then

35:31.633 --> 35:32.633
you'd have a much
easier time becoming

35:32.633 --> 35:34.200
our legal guardians.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.066
Lip's gonna pick up
the results in about an hour.

35:36.066 --> 35:37.734
Well...

35:38.734 --> 35:40.767
...here's to you
not being Frank's.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.100
My actions have been unladylike

35:48.100 --> 35:50.600
and base in nature,
and for that I am

35:50.600 --> 35:52.367
truly sorry.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.100
RANDY:
Karen.

35:55.233 --> 35:57.633
In order for you to receive
the full gift of purity,

35:57.633 --> 36:01.200
you need to be
as honest as you can.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.734
It's okay,
sweetheart.

36:03.734 --> 36:06.333
Just tell what happened.

36:06.333 --> 36:10.767
Um, well, okay.
(chuckles)

36:10.767 --> 36:14.367
I started having oral sex
at a very young age,

36:14.367 --> 36:16.000
maybe 13.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.734
It was guys
around the neighborhood--

36:17.734 --> 36:19.333
three or four at first

36:19.333 --> 36:21.567
and then, well,
more than three

36:21.567 --> 36:23.100
or four.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.433
I didn't have
intercourse

36:24.433 --> 36:26.567
until the eighth grade.

36:26.567 --> 36:28.633
I didn't like it at first,
but then around the sixth time,

36:28.633 --> 36:30.500
it started to feel good,

36:30.500 --> 36:32.734
really good,

36:32.734 --> 36:34.300
but I didn't feel
good about it.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.533
Um, there was

36:35.533 --> 36:38.233
a few times
where I got high

36:38.233 --> 36:42.333
and started experimenting
with guys and girls

36:42.333 --> 36:44.033
at the same time.

36:44.033 --> 36:45.767
I wouldn't necessarily
call it an orgy,

36:45.767 --> 36:49.300
but there were a lot of naked
body parts flying around,

36:49.300 --> 36:52.133
which felt very good
but kind of bad

36:52.133 --> 36:54.467
all at the same time.

36:54.467 --> 36:57.033
And then there was the time
at Mindy Carlson's sleepover

36:57.033 --> 36:58.100
when we all got
in the shower

36:58.100 --> 37:00.667
and started soaping
each other up,

37:00.667 --> 37:02.400
and then her mom walked in
and freaked out

37:02.400 --> 37:04.233
when she saw Mindy
in the shower with a big,

37:04.233 --> 37:05.633
black strap-on dildo.

37:05.633 --> 37:06.700
You whore!

37:07.567 --> 37:10.066
Whores don't get cars!

37:11.567 --> 37:13.400
MONICA:
Okay.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.433
There, I hope
everybody's hungry.

37:19.066 --> 37:24.333
There you go, Ian,
it's your favorite.

37:24.333 --> 37:25.367
What is it?

37:25.367 --> 37:26.533
Lasagna.

37:26.533 --> 37:31.333
Carl, could you start
passing the salad, please?

37:31.333 --> 37:33.667
ROBERTA:
Monica is Liam's mother,
and I know you won't

37:33.667 --> 37:35.467
be happy, but...
Jesus,

37:35.467 --> 37:39.700
Bob, can we just enjoy our
dinner and then talk after...?

37:39.700 --> 37:40.700
Talk about what?

37:40.700 --> 37:41.700
Debbie,

37:41.700 --> 37:42.667
please.

37:42.667 --> 37:44.300
Where's Lip?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.567
Had something
to do.

37:45.567 --> 37:46.633
He's not coming?

37:46.633 --> 37:48.767
Sorry I-I'm late.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.300
Did I miss the chow?

37:50.300 --> 37:53.300
Ooh... looks good.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.200
If you called us here
to tell us

37:55.200 --> 37:56.567
that you're taking Liam
and leaving again,

37:56.567 --> 37:58.700
we don't want to hear it.
Fiona,

37:58.700 --> 38:01.166
you're upset, I get it.

38:01.166 --> 38:03.400
I was married to Frank
for 18 years.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.033
I know, it's like swallowing
broken glass every day.

38:07.033 --> 38:07.700
Hey!

38:09.300 --> 38:12.633
Oh, Lip, wonderful.
We just started.

38:12.633 --> 38:15.033
Your mother said 6:30.

38:15.033 --> 38:15.767
You lose your watch?

38:15.767 --> 38:17.333
I don't have a watch, Bob.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.467
What's the news?

38:19.467 --> 38:21.567
Haven't opened it yet. Figured
we should do it together.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.333
Thanks.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.633
Me and Ian decided

38:24.633 --> 38:27.600
to get our DNA tests
done, too,

38:27.600 --> 38:30.734
on the off chance that
maybe we aren't Frank's kids.

38:30.734 --> 38:32.233
What?

38:32.233 --> 38:34.200
Yeah. We figured
why should you and Bob

38:34.200 --> 38:36.333
get to have all the fun?

38:39.133 --> 38:41.000
Holy shit.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.100
Congratulations, Ian.

38:45.100 --> 38:48.734
You are not
Frank Gallagher's son.

39:01.033 --> 39:02.767
(door slams)
Fuck!

39:02.767 --> 39:04.400
(groans)
Karen?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.233
Sweetie...

39:06.233 --> 39:07.133
Honey?

39:09.166 --> 39:11.700
Sweetie, you're back
from the ball so soon?

39:12.700 --> 39:15.367
Honey?

39:16.567 --> 39:18.333
Karen?

39:18.333 --> 39:19.467
(crashing)

39:19.467 --> 39:22.100
He promised me the fucking car!

39:22.100 --> 39:25.233
Karen, sweetie,
what's going on?

39:25.233 --> 39:28.100
I'm so proud of you!

39:28.100 --> 39:30.333
You remind me of my first
communion!

39:30.333 --> 39:32.066
He humiliated me!

39:32.633 --> 39:35.233
He made me think he loved me!

39:37.100 --> 39:41.133
(sobbing)

39:50.400 --> 39:53.000
Honestly, sweetie,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.133
I don't know.

39:55.133 --> 39:57.533
There was that week in
the summer of '95

39:57.533 --> 39:59.767
that I did a lot of PCP.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.200
And I...
You did PCP?

40:01.200 --> 40:03.600
Without me?!

40:03.600 --> 40:06.266
You promised we would
do that together!

40:06.266 --> 40:08.266
Excuse me. Can we get back
to who Ian's father is?

40:08.266 --> 40:11.433
I like the idea of Monica
cheating on Frank, you know?

40:11.433 --> 40:14.600
It really keeps my image
of you right on track, Mom.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.633
Will somebody please

40:15.633 --> 40:19.000
tell me
what we're talking about?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.433
All right,
the results say

40:20.433 --> 40:22.700
that you, Frank, are
absolutely not my father.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.033
But my father is
a close relative,

40:25.033 --> 40:27.300
most likely one
of your brothers.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.000
Dad has brothers?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.600
He has two, right?

40:29.600 --> 40:30.734
Three.

40:30.734 --> 40:33.300
LIP: You know, I think
I met the one

40:33.300 --> 40:35.066
that sells smoked sausage
and razor blades

40:35.066 --> 40:36.633
out of the trunk
of his car.

40:36.633 --> 40:38.133
All right.

40:38.133 --> 40:40.433
I-I honestly don't know.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.433
Are we still related?

40:44.433 --> 40:46.100
Of course you are.

40:46.100 --> 40:49.667
Not only did you lie
to me about the PC,

40:49.667 --> 40:52.300
you fucked my brother!
What's next?

40:52.300 --> 40:56.367
You gonna take up
with a black lady/man?

40:56.367 --> 40:59.700
Oh, I forgot,
that's already happened.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.700
How can we get
back together now?

41:02.700 --> 41:06.467
I have never, ever had any
intention of getting back

41:06.467 --> 41:07.633
together with you, Frank.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.066
For Chrissake, you only tricked
me into coming here

41:10.066 --> 41:12.133
to get
some settlement money!

41:12.133 --> 41:14.066
I wanted to see you again.

41:14.066 --> 41:16.433
So you pretended that she won
a teddy bear?

41:16.433 --> 41:18.767
You know how much
I love teddy bears.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.066
You and Monica are over, Frank.

41:21.066 --> 41:22.400
Me and Monica are getting
married.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.400
Aah! She's still married to me.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.467
Not for long.
She's getting a divorce.

41:27.467 --> 41:29.367
You two are
still married?

41:29.367 --> 41:31.333
How can two
ladies get married?

41:31.333 --> 41:32.667
They're lesbians.

41:32.667 --> 41:35.000
Penetration isn't required
for sex to occur.

41:37.467 --> 41:39.200
What? It's legal now in
several states.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.200
ROBERTA:
Divorce, Frank.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.734
You owe her at least that much.

41:41.734 --> 41:44.266
What about what she owes me?!

41:44.266 --> 41:47.100
She gonna leave me again
with six kids?

41:47.100 --> 41:49.500
Leave me to deal
with all the shit?

41:49.500 --> 41:51.133
You mean leave me
to deal with the shit.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.467
MONICA:
I didn't leave you!

41:52.467 --> 41:54.367
You drove me out!

41:54.367 --> 41:56.600
No self-respecting person could
stay with you, Frank!

41:56.600 --> 41:59.400
You treated me like a dog!
You...

41:59.400 --> 42:01.133
(clamoring)
Hey, hey!

42:01.133 --> 42:02.467
You need to let us
raise Liam.

42:02.467 --> 42:04.100
I don't care what
the test results say.

42:04.100 --> 42:06.166
Liam belongs with us!

42:06.166 --> 42:07.533
Nobody's taking Liam!

42:07.533 --> 42:10.000
I can't believe you want
a divorce.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.633
Me and Bob deserve
a family of our own.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.767
You had a family!
You left it!

42:17.767 --> 42:21.400
I didn't leave you!
He drove me out!

42:21.400 --> 42:23.233
You should have protected us!

42:23.233 --> 42:25.633
I tried, but I couldn't!

42:25.633 --> 42:28.734
Fiona, if I didn't leave,
I would have died!

42:28.734 --> 42:31.200
Oh, cut the shit, Myrna Loy.

42:31.200 --> 42:35.266
You have no idea what it was
like being married to him.

42:35.266 --> 42:37.734
You have no idea
how bad it is!

42:37.734 --> 42:39.000
Yeah? Try me.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.133
Oh, come on now!

42:41.133 --> 42:45.100
Okay, I know
that he tortured you.

42:45.100 --> 42:49.400
I know that he ruined you,
but we didn't marry him, Mom.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.367
You did.

42:50.367 --> 42:55.500
If you love us,
any of us in any way,

42:55.500 --> 42:57.734
you'll leave Liam,
take your girlfriend,

42:57.734 --> 43:01.567
get in your truck
and never come back.

43:04.734 --> 43:06.300
But...

43:20.266 --> 43:23.500
MONICA:
I...

43:23.500 --> 43:25.000
I love you...

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
(door shuts)

43:26.000 --> 43:28.300
I do.

43:30.767 --> 43:34.100
Shit. (sighs)

43:39.100 --> 43:41.100
What's the matter with you?

43:41.100 --> 43:42.300
She tell you?

43:42.300 --> 43:44.500
She tell you what she said?

43:44.500 --> 43:47.367
You called our daughter a whore.

43:47.367 --> 43:50.033
How about what she did to me?!

43:50.033 --> 43:53.300
Get out. Out.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.233
What...?
Just get out!

43:55.233 --> 43:57.367
Get out!
Did she mention
what she did to me?!

43:57.367 --> 43:58.600
You understand?
Get out!

43:58.600 --> 44:01.333
She's a human being!

44:01.333 --> 44:04.133
She deserves
love, not hate!
