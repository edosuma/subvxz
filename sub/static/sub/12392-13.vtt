WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.021
(male sports announcer)
SO THAT'S IT
FROM THUNDERBIRD STADIUM

00:03.070 --> 00:05.630
AS QUARTERBACK SAM MY WINSLOW
AND THE T-BIRDS

00:05.670 --> 00:07.535
LOSE ANOTHER HEARTBREAKER.

00:07.570 --> 00:08.798
WINSLOW WAS BRILLIANT
AT TIMES TODAY,

00:08.840 --> 00:10.262
THROWING FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS,

00:10.310 --> 00:12.130
BUT HIS TWO SECOND-HALF
INTERCEPTIONS

00:12.180 --> 00:16.048
WERE ABSOLUTE BACKBREAKERS.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.378
THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT
OF MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.810
HEY, YOU SEE, BEING A COP
HAS ITS ADVANTAGES, HUH?

00:20.850 --> 00:22.681
THIS IS PRETI'Y COOL.
OH, THERE HE COMES.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.187
OH, MY GOD.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.517
I GO'I'I'A GET
HIS AUTOGRAPH.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.051
HE'S SO COOL.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.558
(Henry)
JUST RELAX, RELAX.
REMEMBER, HE'S A PERSON.

00:29.590 --> 00:30.579
JUST LIKE ME.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.393
OH, NO, HE'S WAY BETTER
THAN YOU.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.618
HEY.
GOOD GAME.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.469
UH...

00:37.500 --> 00:39.365
UH, GREAT GAME, SAMMY,
BUT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY

00:39.400 --> 00:41.391
YOU THREW THAT INTERCEPTION
IN THE THIRD QUARTER?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.368
WHY?

00:49.410 --> 00:51.071
WELL, EVERY TIME
YOU'RE GONNA THROW A QUICK PASS

00:51.110 --> 00:52.179
TO THE LEFT SIDE,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.745
YOU RUB YOUR HANDS TOGETHER,
THEN PAT THE BALL TWICE.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.418
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU THREW
THOSE SIX PICKS

00:56.450 --> 00:57.678
IN THE LAST THREE GAMES.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.210
OR SOMETHING.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.784
UH, SORRY.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.653
HE'S A PERCEPTIVE

01:04.690 --> 01:06.419
LITTLE PAIN IN THE BU'I'I'
OR SOMETHING.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.529
SORRY.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.597
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
HE'S A QUARTERBACK.

01:10.630 --> 01:11.665
YOU CAN'T TELL HIM--

01:11.700 --> 01:12.837
KID.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.638
OH, MY GOD.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.402
MY GOD.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.249
WHOA.
WE GOT THE GAME BALL.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.305
I GOT
THE GAME BALL.

01:25.350 --> 01:28.148
[exclaims]

01:30.190 --> 01:31.145
(Lassiter)
WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

01:31.190 --> 01:32.509
WE'VE LEFI' YOU
12 MESSAGES.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.515
SORRY, WE WERE HAVING

01:33.560 --> 01:35.812
OUR BIANNUAL RAE DAWN CHONG
MOVIE MARATHON.

01:35.860 --> 01:36.849
DID YOU SEE
QUEST FOR FIRE?

01:36.890 --> 01:38.152
(Juliet)
GUYS!

01:38.190 --> 01:39.794
THE CHIEF IS NOT HAPPY.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.264
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
CELL PHONES ON AT ALL TIMES.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.426
THIS WOULD ALL BE
A LOT EASIER

01:43.470 --> 01:46.234
IF YOU WOULD JUST RUN WITH
MY GENIUS PSYCH SIGNAL IDEA.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.567
NO.
DON'T YOU MEAN YES?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.498
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:48.540 --> 01:50.531
IT'S LIKE THE BAT SIGNAL,
ONLY WAY AWESOMER.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.434
THE SILHOUE'I'I'E IN THE SKY

01:51.470 --> 01:53.506
WOULD BE MY HAND TO MY HEAD,
PSYCHIC-STYLE.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.438
I DREW UP
A WHOLE PROPOSAL.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.675
THAT WOULD HAVE COST
THE DEPARTMENT $200,000.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.371
WE COVERED THAT
WITH OUR BAKE SALE ALONE.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.479
AND WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH OUR BADGES?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.147
YOU'RE NOT GETTING BADGES.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.613
SHE HAS ONE.
SHE'S A COP.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.618
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
WE'LL SETI'LE FOR GUNS.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.379
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.785
COME WITH ME.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.822
WE MAY HAVE
A MISSING PERSONS CASE

02:09.860 --> 02:11.327
WE NEED YOU
TO LOOK INTO.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.850
"MAY HAVE?" THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY DEFINITIVE.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.629
DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS?

02:14.660 --> 02:16.662
THERE'S ONE.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.567
MR. SPENCER,
WE NEED YOU

02:22.610 --> 02:25.101
TO PSYCHICALLY TELL US
WHO BELONGED TO THIS FOOT.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.470
DOES HE KNOW
THAT'S WHERE THEY KEEP

02:30.510 --> 02:31.841
THE BODIES
FOR IDENTIFICATION?

02:31.880 --> 02:34.269
I THINK HE'S FIGURING THAT OUT
RIGHT NOW.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.744
[Gus makes gagging sounds]

02:37.790 --> 02:38.779
THERE YOU GO.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.421
(Vick)
so WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

02:45.460 --> 02:46.757
IT'S WEIRD.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.756
THE LOWER EXTREMITIES
GIVE OFF

02:48.800 --> 02:50.597
VERY, VERY INTENSE
PSYCHIC VIBES.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.734
FOR INSTANCE,
THE PINKY TOE

02:52.770 --> 02:55.261
IS TELLING ME
THAT HE WENT TO THE MARKET.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.632
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S WRONG.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.535
HE, UH,
HE ACTUALLY STAYED HOME.

02:59.580 --> 03:04.540
AND SOMETHING ABOUT WEE-WEE
AND ROAST BEEF.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.741
OKAY, I KNEW THIS WAS
A WASTE OF TIME.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.619
(Juliet)
THE FOOT WAS FOUND
BY HIKERS THIS MORNING

03:15.660 --> 03:17.548
ON A TRAIL
NEAR LAKE CACHUMA.

03:17.590 --> 03:20.229
MR. SPENCER, WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT WE WERE MEANT TO FIND

03:20.260 --> 03:22.660
THIS FOOT, WHICH MEANS THAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH A PSYCHO.

03:22.700 --> 03:23.462
I'M GONNA POSITION
THIS CASE

03:23.500 --> 03:24.967
AS A POSSIBLE
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.831
BUT I CAN ONLY KEEP
THIS FOOT THING QUIET

03:26.870 --> 03:28.462
FOR A DAY OR TWO.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.432
I DON'T WANT TO PANIC
THE COMMUNITY.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.233
YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK
THIS THING MIGHT CAUSE

03:31.270 --> 03:32.669
QUITE A STINK.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.201
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
I JUST FEEL LIKE A HEEL.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.282
THAT WAS CALLOUS.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.879
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

03:48.920 --> 03:49.921
*

03:49.960 --> 03:51.655
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:51.690 --> 03:52.952
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

03:53.000 --> 03:54.922
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:54.960 --> 03:56.689
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

03:56.730 --> 03:57.822
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

03:57.870 --> 03:59.929
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

03:59.970 --> 04:01.733
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:01.770 --> 04:04.261
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:04.310 --> 04:12.718
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

04:12.750 --> 04:13.739
[Shawn sighs]

04:15.580 --> 04:16.979
OH, HEY, YEAH.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.510
HAD TO BOLT
OUT OF THERE.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.381
MY CELL PHONE WAS, LIKE,

04:20.420 --> 04:21.580
LITERALLY SHOCKING MY LEG.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.053
IT MUST BE
THE BATTERY OR SOMETHING.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.284
I LIKE THAT STORY.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.354
LET'S STICK WITH IT.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.220
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
SOMETHING WEIRD

04:26.260 --> 04:28.057
ABOUT THE WAY
THE BIG TOE WAS SMUSHED

04:28.100 --> 04:29.829
AND THE SIDE OF THE FOOT
WAS CALLUSED.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.497
NOT RANDOM,
ALMOST SYMMETRICAL, YOU KNOW,

04:31.530 --> 04:32.838
LIKE IT HAD HAPPENED
OVER TIME.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.292
IT PROBABLY COMES
FROM SOME REPEATED ACTION,

04:34.340 --> 04:35.261
LIKE KICKING.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.063
OR KICKING.
HE COULD HAVE BEEN AN ATHLETE.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.260
LIKE A SOCCER PLAYER.
OR A SOCCER PLAYER.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.376
SORRY.
IT HELPS ME THINK.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.379
GOOGLE "MISSING FOOT."
THAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

04:47.420 --> 04:48.409
NOT ALL OF IT.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.088
(Shawn)
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.350
ROGUE FOOT ON THE LOOSE.
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.551
IT'S HEEL-TOED,

04:54.590 --> 04:56.455
DOWN FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD
TO GIVE ME

04:56.490 --> 04:58.082
A SWIFT KICK IN THE ASS,
AND NOW--

04:58.130 --> 05:00.052
BUT NOW IT'S CHANNELING
A MESSAGE THROUGH MY OWN FOOT.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.055
WHAT'S IT SAYING?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.499
BESIDES, "EVERYONE CUT LOOSE"?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.624
LET'S LISTEN.

05:05.670 --> 05:08.639
SOMETHING ABOUT THE BIG TOE,
THE WAY IT WAS SMUSHED,

05:08.670 --> 05:10.661
CALLUSED, AS IF IT BELONGED
TO SOMEONE

05:10.710 --> 05:12.109
WHO KICKED THINGS
A LOT.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.607
A PRISON GUARD?
A ROCKETI'E?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.039
A KANGAROO.
AN ATHLETE.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.968
YES, AN ATHLETE.
PERHAPS A SOCCER PLAYER?

05:17.010 --> 05:18.409
SOCCER PLAYERS WEAR SHOES.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.109
THE TOE THING WOULDN'T HAPPEN

05:19.150 --> 05:20.708
UNLESS THE PERSON WAS BAREFOOT.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.342
AGAIN, LET ME PITCH KANGAROO.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.812
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE,
SPENCER?

05:23.850 --> 05:24.782
I MEAN,
DO YOU HAVE A NAME?

05:24.820 --> 05:26.685
ARE THEY IN DANGER?
ARE THEY STILL ALIVE?

05:26.720 --> 05:30.087
DARN IT.
VISION GONE.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.496
I'LL HAVE TO SIT
WITH THIS ONE.

05:32.530 --> 05:34.122
JUST GET BACK TO US
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING,

05:34.160 --> 05:35.457
AND IT BE'I'I'ER BE QUICK.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.525
CHIEF, MY MIDDLE NAME
IS QUICK.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.595
I CHANGED IT FROM BOUTROS-GHALI.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.499
(Gus)
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S VLAD ALEXAVIC?

05:44.540 --> 05:45.404
THINK ABOUT IT--
HE'S THE ONLY PLAYER

05:45.440 --> 05:46.509
IN THE LEAGUE
THAT KICKS WITHOUT HIS SHOE.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.872
PLUS, YOU SAID HE HAD SURGERY
ON HIS ANKLE LAST YEAR.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.400
YEAH, HE JUMPED OFF
OF KATHY GRIFFIN'S BALCONY

05:50.450 --> 05:51.474
ON A DARE.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.614
BLEW OUT HIS ANKLE.
MISSED THE ENTIRE PLAYOFFS.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.380
THAT SCAR ON THE ANKLE
WAS FRESH.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.182
I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.482
EVEN FOR YOU,
THAT'S A BIG LEAP.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.487
AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.454
JUST WALK INTO A PRO FOOTBALL
TRAINING CAMP

06:01.490 --> 06:03.151
AND JUST START ASKING
IF ANYONE'S MISSING A FOOT?

06:03.190 --> 06:05.750
THE WORDS "FOOLPROOF" AND "PLAN"
DO COME TO MIND, YES.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.054
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.089
(Shawn)
I WAS DRAWN HERE

06:09.130 --> 06:10.529
BY A NAME THAT'S BEEN KICKING

06:10.570 --> 06:12.128
AROUND MY PSYCHIC THIRD BRAIN.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.798
VLAD--
VLAD ALEXAVIC,
THE T-BIRD KICKER?

06:14.840 --> 06:16.899
YEAH, AFTER YOU LEFT,
I STARTED THINKING

06:16.940 --> 06:18.567
ABOUT THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE BIG TOE

06:18.610 --> 06:20.475
AND AN ATHLETE,
AND THEN I REALIZED

06:20.510 --> 06:21.636
VLAD IS THE ONLY KICKER

06:21.680 --> 06:23.545
WHO KICKS WITHOUT A SHOE.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.844
JULES,
COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.972
AND PURPLE,
WITH A STREAK OF MAGENTA.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.048
WELL, I-I DATED A MIAMI DOLPHIN
FOR A WHILE ONE SUMMER.

06:32.090 --> 06:32.954
OH, YEAH, SO YOU'RE
REALLY ATTRACT ED

06:32.990 --> 06:35.117
TO BIG, MEAT-HEADED
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.458
OH, THEY'RE NOT
ALL MEATH EADS.

06:37.490 --> 06:41.449
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT UNIFORM.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.489
MM.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.168
YEAH.
SO.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.088
ANYWAY.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.097
SHAWN AND I THOUGHT
THAT IF WE COULD GET

06:47.140 --> 06:48.459
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT VLAD--

06:48.500 --> 06:50.104
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.607
WE MATCHED DNA SAMPLES
TO THE FOOT YESTERDAY.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.505
IT'S VLAD.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.076
SET, HUT!

07:02.120 --> 07:03.439
OUT ROUND.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.153
DUDE, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

07:10.190 --> 07:12.158
WE'RE STANDING ON THE FIELD

07:12.190 --> 07:13.191
OF AN ACTUAL PRO FOOTBALL
TRAINING CAMP.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.652
THIS IS AWESOME.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.758
MY DAD WOULD LOVE THIS.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.892
YEAH.

07:16.930 --> 07:18.466
TOO BAD HE'S NOT TALKING
TO YOU.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.092
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE
ON THE CAMPING TRIP.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.732
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO HIM
NEXT WEEK.

07:21.770 --> 07:22.634
I'LL HEAD OVER THERE
FOR DINNER,

07:22.670 --> 07:23.762
BRING HIM A POUCH
OF BIG LEAGUE CHEW,

07:23.810 --> 07:26.608
MAYBE WATCH A COUPLE OF EPISODES
OF THE MENTALIST.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.607
IT'LL BE FINE.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.198
[whistle blows]

07:29.240 --> 07:32.038
[growls]

07:35.850 --> 07:36.942
OH!

07:36.990 --> 07:39.550
[grunt]

07:55.170 --> 07:56.262
4-3-7-3,
BREAK.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.200
(players)
BREAK.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.809
(Shawn)
DUDE!

08:00.840 --> 08:03.206
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE COOLEST CASE OF ALL TIME.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.979
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
MY AUTOGRAPH BOOK.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.272
I'VE BEEN STUCK
ON C. EVERETT KOOP

08:06.310 --> 08:08.210
AND DREW LACHEY FOR A WHILE.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.717
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.741
A BUNCH OF GUYS IN TIGHTS
AND HARD HATS,

08:11.790 --> 08:13.052
PLAYING IN THE DIRT.

08:13.090 --> 08:14.216
WHAT?

08:14.260 --> 08:15.750
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF FOOTBALL.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.257
WHAT ARE YOU A FAN OF,
EXACTLY?

08:17.290 --> 08:19.554
I DON'T KNOW.
THE GUN SPORTS.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.295
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

08:21.330 --> 08:22.866
TO TALK TO SAM WINSLOW.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.265
HE'S THE COACH
AND GENERAL MANAGER.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.222
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WE GET
TO MEET SLINGIN' SAMMY WINSLOW?

08:26.270 --> 08:28.295
WHAT!
SO?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.295
SO HE'S ONE
OF THE GREATEST QUARTERBACKS

08:29.340 --> 08:31.001
IN THE HISTORY
OF PRO FOOTBALL.

08:31.040 --> 08:31.802
(Shawn)
HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.129
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT MY DAD AND I BOTH LIKE

08:35.180 --> 08:37.148
BESIDES ASIAN SLAW
AND HARRY HAMLIN.

08:37.180 --> 08:39.000
WHO'S WITH ME?
WHO'S WITH ME ON HAMLIN?

08:40.850 --> 08:42.943
LITERALLY,
NO ONE IS WITH YOU.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.742
SAMMY WON A CHAMPIONSHIP
HIS FIRST SEASON

08:44.790 --> 08:46.143
AS A COACH,
BUT HE HASN'T EVEN BEEN

08:46.190 --> 08:47.782
TO THE PLAYOFFS
IN SIX YEARS.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.924
IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD COACH.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.279
(Sammy)
COME ON.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.548
YOU CALL THAT
A TWO-MINUTE DRILL?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.124
I COULD GET TO DALLAS

08:55.160 --> 08:57.162
ON MY NEPHEW'S BIG WHEEL
FASTER THAN YOU LADIES.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.963
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
RESET.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.228
[whistle blows]

09:00.270 --> 09:01.931
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.608
I SEE YOU'RE TOO TALL
TO BE AN AGENT.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.265
YOU MUST BE
A SHOE REP.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.800
NO, I'M A COP.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.205
WE NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR PLAYERS.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.571
I'M DETECTIVE LASSITER.

09:08.610 --> 09:10.146
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE O'HARA,

09:10.180 --> 09:11.169
AND THESE ARE...

09:13.380 --> 09:14.847
NEVER MIND.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.610
I DON'T WANT THE PRESS
TO SEE THIS.

09:17.650 --> 09:18.878
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES,
ALL RIGHT.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.319
COME WITH ME.

09:21.990 --> 09:22.979
WHAT?

09:29.060 --> 09:30.766
YOU FOUND VLAD'S FOOT?

09:30.800 --> 09:31.960
YOU SURE IT'S HIS?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.661
I'M AFRAID SO.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.598
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.369
IT'S BEEN
A FEW WEEKS.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.231
I MEAN,
HE WAS A HOLDOUT.

09:38.270 --> 09:40.773
I MEAN, VLAD'S ALWAYS BEEN
A BIT OF A FREE SPIRIT.

09:40.810 --> 09:43.643
I MEAN, HE'S DISAPPEARED
DURING THE OFF-SEASON BEFORE.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.704
I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS DOING IT AGAIN.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.103
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEAK
WITH SOME OF YOUR PLAYERS.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.879
WE'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU KEPT THE INFORMATION

09:47.920 --> 09:49.615
ABOUT MR. ALEXAVIC QUIET
FOR THE TIME BEING.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.016
COULD SOMEONE HAVE KILLED HIM?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.654
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE
TO FIND OUT.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.654
[sighs and mumbles]

10:00.430 --> 10:02.295
(Lassiter)
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

10:02.330 --> 10:05.128
BUT YOU TWO THINK YOU COULD HAVE
SPOKEN UP A LITTLE BIT?

10:05.170 --> 10:06.933
OH.

10:06.970 --> 10:07.937
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.232
IT'S WHAT HAPPENS
TO US

10:09.270 --> 10:11.363
WHEN WE'RE IN THE PRESENCE
OF ONE OF OUR HEROES.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.332
GUS ALMOST FAINTED
WHEN WE RAN INTO RALPH MACCHIO

10:13.380 --> 10:14.278
AT A DEL TACO.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.642
FOR THE RECORD,
HE WAS NOT WORKING THERE.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.147
WHY DON'T WE INTERVIEW
THE PLAYERS

10:18.180 --> 10:19.875
AND YOU GUYS TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING ELSE?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.376
SURE.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.012
HEARD YOU GUYS WERE ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT VLAD.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.415
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:24.450 --> 10:26.247
IT'S UNCLEAR
AT THIS POINT,

10:26.290 --> 10:27.257
MR. TOMPKINS.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.279
IT'S MATT.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.959
LOOK, VLAD'S ONE OF MY BROS.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.855
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
I WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.390
IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT VLAD,

10:34.430 --> 10:36.091
WE COULD REALLY USE
THE HELP.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.768
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO START
ANY RUMORS OR ANYTHING,

10:37.800 --> 10:40.792
BUT I DID HEAR THAT HE OWED
A LOT OF MONEY TO PEOPLE.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.239
(Lassiter)
WHAT PEOPLE?

10:42.270 --> 10:43.305
BOOKIES, I THINK.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.102
I ALSO HEARD A RUMOR

10:44.140 --> 10:45.004
THAT HE TRIED TO START
A NIGHT CLUB

10:45.040 --> 10:48.271
WITH SOME OF HIS COUSINS
AND LOST A SH--

10:48.310 --> 10:50.244
LOAD OF MONEY.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.771
THAT'D BE RUSSIAN COUSINS?

10:53.450 --> 10:54.644
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.442
[exhaling strongly]

10:57.490 --> 11:00.755
[imitating a football call]

11:00.790 --> 11:02.678
EH!

11:04.490 --> 11:06.151
GREAT, WHILE YOU GUYS
WERE GOOFING OFF,

11:06.190 --> 11:07.293
WE ACTUALLY GOT
A LEAD.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.322
MATT TOMPKINS TOLD US
THAT VLAD LOST A BUNCH OF MONEY

11:10.370 --> 11:11.860
THAT BELONGED
TO SOME RUSSIAN COUSINS.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.889
WHAT'D YOU GUYS FIND?

11:12.940 --> 11:15.033
JUST THIS.
WHAT'S THAT?

11:15.070 --> 11:16.162
VLAD'S PHONE.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.269
WE FOUND IT
IN HIS LOCKER.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.265
YOU STOLE IT?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.403
BENJI, THE LOCKER ROOM
ATTENDANT, LET US IN.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.407
BIG FAN OF RENT.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.078
TOLD HIM GUS
WAS TAYE DIGGS,

11:23.110 --> 11:24.179
SO HE ALSO GAVE US
THESE OLD JERSEYS.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.347
HOW DO I LOOK,
JULES?

11:25.380 --> 11:28.372
LIKE MY 11-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW
IN HIS PEYTON MANNING PAJAMAS.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.910
YOUR 11-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW'S
RUGGEDLY SEXY.

11:29.950 --> 11:30.917
THAT'S WEIRD.

11:30.950 --> 11:31.917
WHOA.
HANG ON.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.417
LOOK AT THAT.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.258
THAT IS A DIRECT THREAT.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.951
THIS PLUS THE FOOT
SCREAMS RUSSIAN MOB.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.218
REALLY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.227
I'M JUST SAYING

11:40.260 --> 11:41.989
WE FOUND THAT PHONE
AWFULLY EASY,

11:42.030 --> 11:43.258
AND THERE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE

11:43.300 --> 11:44.722
A THREATENING TEXT
ON IT? COME ON.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.761
SO YOU THINK SOMEONE PLANTED IT
IN HIS LOCKER.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.267
NO, I THINK SOMEONE PUT IT THERE
ON PURPOSE.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.836
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.132
MINE WASN'T IN THE FORM
OF A QUESTION,

11:51.170 --> 11:52.774
SO IT COMES
FROM A PLACE OF POWER.

11:52.810 --> 11:55.199
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND LISTEN TO THIS,

11:55.240 --> 11:56.844
AND WE'LL BE BACK
WITH A SEARCH WARRANT

11:56.880 --> 11:57.869
FOR THE CONTENTS
OF THAT LOCKER.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.743
YOU SEE, WE ACTUALLY FOLLOW
POLICE PROCEDURE.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.839
(Shawn)
OH.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.347
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

12:05.390 --> 12:07.278
BENJI SAID THE ONLY ONES
ALLOWED IN THE LOCKER ROOM

12:07.320 --> 12:09.254
ARE PLAYERS
AND TEAM PERSONNEL.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.382
THE ANSWER TO WHAT HAPPENED
TO VLAD

12:10.430 --> 12:12.898
IS NOT
IN SOME RUSSIAN BATHHOUSE.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.795
NO, WE NEED TO GET CLOSE
TO THE TEAM.

12:14.830 --> 12:15.990
ARE YOU SAYING
WE GO UNDERCOVER?

12:16.030 --> 12:17.998
I'M SAYING WE ASSUME
ALTERNATE IDENTITIES

12:18.030 --> 12:20.237
SO THAT WE CAN GET IN THERE
AND INVESTIGATE

12:20.270 --> 12:23.831
WITHOUT DRAWING ANY
EXTRA ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.

12:27.540 --> 12:28.507
[knock at door]

12:28.540 --> 12:29.507
(Shawn)
COACH WINSLOW?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.007
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.745
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
COME IN.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.314
YOU WERE
WITH THE COPS EARLIER.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.511
YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.553
NO, IT'S BECAUSE
I WAS OBSERVING.

12:42.590 --> 12:43.557
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.557
I'M A PSYCHIC

12:44.590 --> 12:46.421
THAT WORKS
FOR THE SBPD.

12:46.460 --> 12:50.169
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DU QUOIN "SMALLPOX" RANDOLPH.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.292
YOU CAN CALL HIM GUS.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.389
WE WORK ON HIGH-PROFILE CASES

12:53.440 --> 12:54.839
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.

12:54.870 --> 12:57.361
YEAH, WELL,
THIS IS MY FAULT.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.968
I MEAN, I KNEW
THAT VLAD WAS GOING

12:59.010 --> 13:00.807
OFF THE RAILS,
AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.807
NO, NO, NO,
COACH, PLEASE.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.809
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.306
YOU--YOU PROBABLY GET THIS
A LOT,

13:06.350 --> 13:09.319
BUT WE'RE HUGE FANS
OF YOURS.

13:09.350 --> 13:10.886
[Gus and Shawn chuckle]

13:10.920 --> 13:13.457
I SLEPT ON YOUR FACE
FOR YEARS.

13:13.490 --> 13:14.457
I MEAN,

13:14.490 --> 13:16.515
I HAD SHEETS WITH YOU ON THEM
WHEN I WAS A KID.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.425
(Shawn)
AND WE'VE ACTUALLY MET BEFORE.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.279
I WAS THE KID
AFTER THE DENVER GAME

13:19.330 --> 13:21.025
WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT YOUR INTERCEPTIONS.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.049
OH, YEAH.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.419
I TOLD YOU
HE'D REMEMBER ME.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.324
YEAH.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.359
[laughs]

13:26.400 --> 13:27.537
YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T THROW

13:27.570 --> 13:28.832
A PICK THE REST OF THE YEAR.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.907
OH, BOY, I THOUGHT
I'D PLAY FOOTBALL FOREVER,

13:32.940 --> 13:35.101
YOU KNOW?

13:35.140 --> 13:37.904
SURE AS HECK NEVER THOUGHT
I'D END UP A COACH.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.147
WELL, COACH,

13:41.180 --> 13:43.489
I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'M SENSING

13:43.520 --> 13:45.545
SOME VERY DARK FORCES
COMING FROM YOUR TEAM.

13:45.590 --> 13:46.887
WHOEVER DID THIS
TO VLAD

13:46.920 --> 13:49.081
MIGHT WANT TO HARM
OTHER PLAYERS

13:49.120 --> 13:50.348
AS WELL.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.187
I THINK
THAT WE CAN HELP.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.448
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY HELP?

13:57.930 --> 13:58.897
RED 17!

13:58.930 --> 14:00.488
RED 17 CHECK DOWN!

14:00.540 --> 14:01.495
CHECK DOWN!
RED!

14:01.540 --> 14:02.564
17 DRAGON!

14:02.600 --> 14:03.601
WILDEBEEST!
SHAWN!

14:03.640 --> 14:05.062
BEVELL CAME BACK TOO EARLY

14:05.110 --> 14:06.134
FROM HIS CONCUSSION.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.137
HE'S AFRAID OF GETTING HIT.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.306
FLETCHER.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.898
WELL, HE'S WORRYING
ABOUT HIS DIVORCE.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.008
HE'S NOT FOCUSED
ON THE GAME.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.472
DAYNE MAY SEEM HEAW,
BUT IT'S JUST WATER WEIGHT.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.171
HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE FINE.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.949
BOLLINGER IS FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE HE THINKS HIS WIFE

14:15.980 --> 14:17.208
MIGHT KNOW THAT HE'S SLEEPING

14:17.250 --> 14:18.387
WITH THE REPORTER
FROM CHANNEL FIVE.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.546
AND CALDERWOOD,
WELL, HE'S JUST

14:19.590 --> 14:20.409
NOT COOL WITH BEING DEMOTED

14:20.460 --> 14:23.088
TO SECOND TEAM,
EVEN IF HE SAYS HE IS.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.586
YES, NO, MEAN,

14:24.630 --> 14:26.894
JUICED, POSSIBLY GAY,

14:26.930 --> 14:29.296
DEFINITELY GAY.

14:29.330 --> 14:32.629
[laughs]

14:32.670 --> 14:33.637
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.365
I MEAN,
I ALREADY KNEW

14:35.400 --> 14:36.936
ABOUT DAYNE,
SUSPECT ED KENNY,

14:36.970 --> 14:39.268
BUT I MEAN, THAT STILL--
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

14:39.310 --> 14:40.629
SO WHAT IS IN THIS
FOR YOU?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.604
WELL, WE JUST WANT TO FIND
WHOEVER DID THIS TO VLAD,

14:43.650 --> 14:44.674
HELP YOU GET
YOUR TEAM BACK.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.439
HUH.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.983
AND MAYBE LEAD THE TEAM
OUT OF THE TUNNEL

14:52.020 --> 14:53.248
ONE TIME
BEFORE A GAME?

14:53.290 --> 14:54.951
THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.457
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I MAY NEED YOUR HELP.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.526
BUT THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.425
I MEAN, THESE GUYS ARE
NOT GONNA JUST LET

15:00.460 --> 15:02.928
SOMEBODY WALK IN OFF THE STREET
AND GET CLOSE TO THEM.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.564
THEY HAVE TO THINK
THAT YOU BELONG.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.091
(Lassiter)
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET THIS DONE FAST.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.334
WE'VE GOT TEN OTHER SPOTS
TO CHECK TODAY.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.962
THEY SAID THE LOCKER ROOM GUY
HAS THE KEY,

15:11.010 --> 15:14.400
AND HE'S ON THE FIELD.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.976
ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO SEE
ALL THE KICKERS TRYING OUT

15:16.010 --> 15:17.568
ON THE FIELD RIGHT NOW.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.180
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S REAL.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.221
FEEL FREE TO DRINK IT IN.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.245
(Shawn)
SO, ADAM,

15:54.280 --> 15:56.145
VLAD JUST CAME IN HERE
LAST YEAR

15:56.180 --> 15:57.738
AND BEAT YOU OUT
FOR THE JOB, HUH?

15:57.790 --> 16:02.489
YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT HERE,
SO IT'S MY JOB TO WIN NOW.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.058
EH.
SHANKED THAT A LITTLE.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.057
I NEVER HEARD OF YOU
BEFORE.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.624
YOU SAID YOU PLAYED
IN TAMPA?

16:08.660 --> 16:10.491
[grunts]

16:10.530 --> 16:12.066
TEL AVIV.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.237
ISRAELI ARENA LEAGUE.

16:13.270 --> 16:14.760
DIDN'T PLAY ON THE SABBATH,
SO YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T SEE ME.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.132
I'VE ALSO BEEN OUT OF THE GAME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.239
I HAD A COUPLE
OF KNEE SURGERIES,

16:18.270 --> 16:20.079
AND THIS ELBOW IS FILLED

16:20.110 --> 16:21.202
WITH OSTRICH CARTILAGE.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.309
(Winslow)
SIX.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.274
GET OUT THERE
AND KICK.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.142
DID I SEE YOU GIVE AN INTERVIEW
TO ESPN THIS MORNING?

16:29.180 --> 16:30.784
FIRST OF ALL,
IT WAS ESPN DEPORTES.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.311
AND IT WAS AN EXCLUSIVE,
COACH.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.316
YOU CAN'T BE GIVING
INTERVIEWS.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.225
YOU'RE A NON-ROSTER
INVITEE.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.057
I TOLD THE DOCS
YOU HAD AN MCL TEAR,

16:39.090 --> 16:40.125
WHICH MEANS NO KICKING.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.354
YOU'RE HERE TO SOLVE
A MURDER.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.129
NO INTERVIEWS, NO KICKING,
SOLVE THE MURDER.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.194
GOT IT.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.162
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO, GIRLS.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.394
PICK IT UP.

16:46.430 --> 16:49.137
MY GRANDMOTHER MOVES FASTER
THAN THAT.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.706
ALL RIGHT, ESTEVEZ,
ESTEVEZ, YOU'RE UP.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.379
ACTUALLY IT'S EMILIO
ESTEVEZ, EST-TEV-EZ.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.776
AND I HAVE A KNEE INJURY,
SO I CAN'T KICK.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.107
IF YOU AIN'T GONNA KICK,
THEN GET OFF THIS FIELD.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.606
YOU SAYING
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE?

16:58.650 --> 16:59.776
NO. GET OUT THERE.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.488
WHAT'S UP?

17:12.530 --> 17:14.498
THAT WAS AWESOME!

17:14.530 --> 17:16.225
IT WAS JUST A 21-YARDER.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.490
YEAH, WELL, I WAS
IN AN IRON LUNG A WEEK AGO.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.622
HUH?

17:19.670 --> 17:20.830
DUDE, CHECK THE BOOKS.

17:20.870 --> 17:22.132
I THINK I JUST TIED
TOM DEMPSEY'S RECORD

17:22.170 --> 17:23.159
FOR LONGEST FIELD GOAL.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.438
YEAH, NO,
YOU DIDN'T.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.700
HIS RECORD IS 63 YARDS,
NOT 63 FEET.

17:26.740 --> 17:27.536
WHAT'S UP IN YOUR WORLD?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.702
LOOK, SHAWN,
WE CAN'T BE WASTING TIME.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.741
LASSITER'S ON HIS RUSSIAN THING,
AND WE ONLY HAVE TWO DAYS

17:32.780 --> 17:34.213
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO VLAD.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.413
TWO DAYS TO FULFILL
20 YEARS OF FANTASIES.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.213
THAT'S WHAT A TEAM MANAGER
WEARS, HUH?

17:39.250 --> 17:40.581
I'M NOT A TEAM MANAGER.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.212
I'M A TRAINING INTERN.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.353
AND I'VE BEEN SETTING UP MASSAGE
TABLES FOR THE LAST HOUR.

17:44.390 --> 17:46.324
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO
ON THOSE MASSAGE TABLES, SHAWN?

17:46.360 --> 17:47.292
THEY PLAY CONNECT FOUR.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.592
THEY MASSAGE MEN.

17:48.630 --> 17:49.756
BIG, HAIRY MEN.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.767
MM.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.869
LOOK, LET ME
BE VERY CLEAR.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.095
THESE HANDS ARE NOT TOUCHING
ANYONE.

17:54.140 --> 17:58.133
I ONLY USE THESE HANDS
TO TOUCH MYSELF.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.762
UH,
LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

17:59.810 --> 18:00.731
PLEASE STOP SPEAKING.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.532
AND NO MORE FIST BUMPS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.704
CARLTON, WE HAVE BEEN
TO EVERY PLACE

18:05.750 --> 18:07.342
EVEN REMOTELY CONNECTED
TO RUSSIA

18:07.380 --> 18:09.575
AND ALL OF EASTERN EUROPE,
AND WE HAVE FOUND NOTHING.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.247
WE HAVE TO START LOOKING
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.282
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS
STUFF FROM VLAD'S LOCKER.

18:18.490 --> 18:19.821
JUST A BUNCH OF JUNK.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.897
HUH.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.818
WHAT?

18:24.870 --> 18:26.462
WELL, TOMPKINS SAID HE THOUGHT
VLAD WAS GAMBLING, RIGHT?

18:26.500 --> 18:27.762
YEAH.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.835
THESE COULD BE BETS
THAT HE MADE.

18:28.870 --> 18:31.134
LOOK,
IT SAYS MIAMI PLUS SIX,

18:31.170 --> 18:32.137
K.C. MINUS TWO.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.728
LOOK AT THIS.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.338
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.529
DO YOU STILL HAVE
VLAD'S PHONE RECORDS?

18:36.580 --> 18:38.207
YEAH, BUT THEY
DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.376
THE TEXT VLAD GOT
WAS FROM A DISPOSABLE PHONE.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.377
CHECK THIS.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.139
805-555-14--

18:43.190 --> 18:44.282
2-1?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.743
THAT NUMBER CALLED VLAD
TWICE LAST WEEK.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.382
WE GOT A LEAD.
LET'S GO.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.282
WHILE YOU WERE FOOLING AROUND,
I WAS INVESTIGATING.

18:52.330 --> 18:55.322
EVER SINCE THE COPS CAME,
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT VLAD.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.499
HYAH!

18:57.530 --> 18:58.326
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

18:58.370 --> 19:00.565
NONE OF THE PLAYERS
LIKED THAT DUDE.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.238
HE EITHER OWES THEM MONEY,

19:02.270 --> 19:03.498
TRIED TO SLEEP
WITH THEIR WIVES,

19:03.540 --> 19:04.529
OR CALLED THEM OUT
IN THE PRESS.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.877
[groans]

19:09.910 --> 19:11.275
DID I MOVE IT?

19:11.310 --> 19:13.244
NO.
NOT ONE NANOMETER.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.419
NANOMETER. WHAT IS THAT?
LIKE TWO OR THREE FEET?

19:15.450 --> 19:17.611
[grunts and metal rattling]

19:19.290 --> 19:20.314
WHEW.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.315
I DON'T THINK
EVERYONE HATED VLAD.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.486
CHECK IT OUT.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.226
HE HAS ONE
OF THOSE WARRIORS TOWELS

19:24.260 --> 19:25.284
IN HIS LOCKER TOO.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.319
THEY CALL THEMSELVES
THE WARRIORS

19:26.360 --> 19:28.294
BECAUSE THEY'RE
THE CRAZIEST GUYS ON THE TEAM.

19:28.330 --> 19:30.389
MATT TOMPKINS,
VINCE GARNER,

19:30.430 --> 19:31.397
AND DREW SHACKER
ARE THE LEADERS.

19:31.430 --> 19:33.489
MAN.

19:33.540 --> 19:37.237
[shouts]

19:37.270 --> 19:39.659
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET CLOSE TO THOSE GUYS

19:39.710 --> 19:41.837
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
GETTING A LOBOTOMY

19:41.880 --> 19:45.873
OR SHOWERING WITH STRANGE MEN
WITH VOLCANO NIPPLES.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.648
COACH IS CRAZY IF HE THINKS

19:48.680 --> 19:50.284
I'M PLAYING SPECIAL TEAMS
THIS YEAR.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.311
I GET INJURED ON A PLAY,
THERE GOES MY BONUS.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.387
EXACTLY,
RIGHT?

19:55.420 --> 19:56.580
WHOA!

19:56.620 --> 19:58.383
AAH!

19:58.430 --> 19:59.556
WHEW.

20:00.760 --> 20:01.829
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:01.860 --> 20:03.669
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN
ALTERED STATES?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.496
NO.

20:04.530 --> 20:06.521
JUST GOT BACK
FROM BEING A MONKEY.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.404
WHY DID I THINK
THAT WOULD LAND?

20:10.440 --> 20:11.907
YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF US, BRO.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.003
SORRY, BRO.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.939
EMILIO ESTEVEZ
EST-TE-VEZ.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.969
NEW KICKER.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.339
YOU MEAN
LIKE THE ACTOR GUY?

20:23.390 --> 20:24.584
YOU'RE THINKING
OF CHARLIE SHEEN.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.349
WHAT?

20:26.390 --> 20:27.516
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.327
NICE INK.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.486
THAN KS, MAN.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.350
YEAH, THIS IS MY WIFE.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.652
THAT'S MY MOM.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.463
AND THAT'S THE STRIPPER I HOOK
UP WITH IN VEGAS SOMETIMES.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.762
[laughter]

20:38.800 --> 20:40.461
(Shawn)
VERY SWEET.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.331
I DATED A DANCER ONCE.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.337
DESTINY.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.667
REAL NAME WAS GLITTER.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.007
NOTHING THERE?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.576
[splashing]

20:48.610 --> 20:50.749
SO WHAT'S UP

20:50.780 --> 20:52.543
WITH YOUR KICKER, VLAD?

20:52.580 --> 20:54.377
SOME PRETTY CRAZY RUMORS
FLOATING AROUND.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.671
(Matt)
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU, MAN.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.415
VLAD'S KIND OF A LONER.

20:57.450 --> 20:58.314
YEAH,
WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HIM.

20:58.350 --> 21:00.045
I HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT SOME RUSSIANS.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.479
I HOPE IT'S NOT
THAT THEY'RE COMING.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.322
THEY'RE COMING.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.452
THE RUSSIANS.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.259
WELL, THAT'S IT
FOR ME.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.539
I...

21:21.510 --> 21:24.502
I GOTTA GO
GET MY STEROIDS SHOT.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.542
WHOOPS. PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.377
STEER CLEAR.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.809
MIGHT BE SOME PEE
IN THAT ONE.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.424
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE ADDRESS.

21:37.460 --> 21:40.395
AND THERE'S A PICTURE
OF VLAD ON THE SHELF.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.590
OH, NO.

21:41.630 --> 21:44.463
LOOK AT THAT.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.365
MADAM,

21:46.400 --> 21:49.836
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THAT PICTURE HERE?

21:49.870 --> 21:52.464
(woman)
OOH, I'M A HUGE FAN OF CHAD.

21:52.510 --> 21:55.479
ONE DAY I PLAN
TO HAVE HIS BABY.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.341
WE'RE DETECT IVES
WITH THE SBPD.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.904
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY
INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE

21:58.950 --> 22:00.008
ON VLAD ALEXAVIC.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.369
[man speaking Russian]

22:03.390 --> 22:04.482
[shouts in Russian]

22:04.520 --> 22:05.782
GO AROUND BACK.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.007
GET ON YOUR KNEES!

22:24.040 --> 22:26.008
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.871
NICE WORK,
O'HARA.

22:29.410 --> 22:32.470
"SERGEE VAN GEEF."

22:32.510 --> 22:33.716
VANGIEFF.
YEAH, WHATEVER.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.617
YOU, MY FRIEND, HAVE
A BIG PROBLEM.

22:36.650 --> 22:38.515
YOUR VISA RUNS OUT
NEXT MONTH.

22:38.550 --> 22:39.539
SO?

22:39.590 --> 22:41.751
SO YOU EITHER GIVE US
SOMETHING,

22:41.790 --> 22:44.486
OR IT'S BYE-BYE, SANTA BARBARA;
HELLO, ST. PETERSBURG.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.088
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO RUSSIA, MAN.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.428
MY LADY AND I, WE ARE STARTING
AQUARIUM STORE.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.155
WE ALREADY HAVE
A BATHTUB FULL OF KOI.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.122
WHY WERE YOU CALLING
VLAD ALEXAVIC LAST WEEK?

22:52.170 --> 22:53.865
DID I?

22:55.640 --> 22:58.461
OKAY.
VLAD OWES ME MONEY.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.535
YOU WERE BOOKING BETS
FOR HIM, RIGHT?

23:00.580 --> 23:01.535
THAT'S WHY YOU RAN?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.605
DA.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.538
BUT IT WAS JUST TO MAKE MONEY
TO BUY FOUNTAIN

23:05.580 --> 23:06.547
OF CHILD SPITTING WATER

23:06.580 --> 23:07.774
FOR STORE.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.674
HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND
INTRODUCED US.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.914
VLAD AND I ARE FRIENDS.

23:10.950 --> 23:14.113
SERGEI, BOOKMAKING'S
A VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.617
WHAT IS THAT NOW,
LIKE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON?

23:16.660 --> 23:18.525
OH, MORE IF YOU TAKE
THE BETS OVER THE PHONE.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.653
THAT'S INTERSTATE WIRE FRAUD.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.622
WHO'S GONNA FEED
ALL THOSE FISH?

23:25.870 --> 23:27.565
ARE YOU GONNA START SOON?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.629
I ALREADY DID.

23:31.670 --> 23:32.705
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:32.740 --> 23:33.729
YOU DON'T FEEL IT?

23:35.240 --> 23:36.605
FEEL WHAT?
THE HEAT.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.803
SEE, I'M USING
WHAT'S CALLED

23:39.850 --> 23:41.112
THE, UH, HOVERING TECHNIQUE.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.118
I LEARNED IT
FROM SOME MONKS IN CAMBODIA.

23:43.150 --> 23:45.789
IT'S FORBIDDEN
TO TOUCH THE SKIN.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.927
YEAH, I THINK
I FEEL IT.

23:53.960 --> 23:54.949
YOU DO?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.456
I MEAN,
GOOD.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.719
NOW WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO

23:59.770 --> 24:00.759
IS CLOSE YOUR EYES TIGHT

24:00.800 --> 24:03.633
AND FOCUS
ON THE POWER SOURCE

24:03.670 --> 24:06.002
COMING FROM MY HANDS.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.634
YEAH.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.238
NOW I TOTALLY FEEL IT.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.771
AW, YEAH.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.619
THAT'S AWESOME.

24:14.650 --> 24:17.210
AH.
CAN YOU DO THE BUTTOCKS?

24:17.250 --> 24:19.548
THE HOVER TECHNIQUE?

24:19.590 --> 24:21.649
RESOURCEFUL GUS MAKES
A RARE APPEARANCE.

24:21.690 --> 24:22.782
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE SOMETHING

24:22.820 --> 24:24.151
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.953
DEPENDS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT POISON OAK?

24:25.990 --> 24:27.252
WHAT CAN'T I TELL YOU?

24:27.290 --> 24:28.655
IT'S THE THREE-LEAVED DEVIL.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.861
CAUSES SEVERE ITCHING
AND A RED BUMPY RASH.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.595
FOUND ONLY ON THE PACIFIC COAST

24:32.630 --> 24:34.097
AND USUALLY NEAR BODIES
OF FRESH WATER.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.597
HUH.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.699
THE FOOT WAS FOUND BY HIKERS
THIS MORNING

24:38.740 --> 24:39.866
ON A TRAIL
NEAR LAKE CACHUMA.

24:39.910 --> 24:43.607
COME ON. WE GOTTA CALL THE ME.
AND CHECK SOMETHING OUT.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.049
BUT I THINK I MIGHT KNOW
WHERE VLAD'S BODY IS.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.877
HOW?
CALAMINE LOTION.

24:46.910 --> 24:48.218
CALAMINE LOTION?

24:53.050 --> 24:54.017
ALL RIGHT,
THAN KS.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.084
YOU WERE RIGHT.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.213
THE M.E. SAID THE PINK FLAKES
UNDER VLAD'S TOENAILS

24:57.260 --> 24:58.727
WERE DRIED CALAMINE LOTION.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.297
AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST LAKE
TO TRAINING CAMP.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.093
COPS OBVIOUSLY GOT
MY MESSAGE.

25:03.130 --> 25:04.097
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:04.130 --> 25:05.165
IT'S GAME TIME.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.599
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW
THEIR MINDS.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.699
HOW DO I LOOK?

25:07.740 --> 25:08.764
LIKE AN IDIOT.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.199
SWEET.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.672
SORRY I'M LATE.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.200
PRACTICE RAN LONG.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.673
BY THE WAY,
JULES,

25:17.710 --> 25:18.745
YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUMP
ON THE SPENCER BANDWAGON,

25:18.780 --> 25:20.304
SIGN UP
FOR MY NEWSLETTER,

25:20.350 --> 25:21.544
MAYBE BUY MY FATHEAD.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.138
SPENCER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.545
IT'S VLAD'S BODY.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.717
IT'S DARK,
IT'S MURKY,

25:28.760 --> 25:30.785
HIS VOICE IS A LITTLE,
UH--

25:30.830 --> 25:31.455
WARBLY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:31.490 --> 25:32.627
LIKE IT'S CALLING
TO ME

25:32.660 --> 25:34.924
FROM UNDERWATER.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.951
MAYBE A RIVER OR STREAM.
PERHAPS, A--

25:37.000 --> 25:37.989
LAKE?

25:39.870 --> 25:41.861
YEAH, WE PULLED OUT VLAD'S BODY
AN HOUR AGO.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.669
MR. SPENCER,
IT LOOKS LIKE

25:46.710 --> 25:48.678
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE
TO THE GAME THIS TIME.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.678
(Lassiter)
WHAT, NO WI'I'I'Y RETORT?

25:50.710 --> 25:52.644
NO REFERENCE
TO SOME OBSCURE '805 FILM?

25:52.680 --> 25:54.147
WOW.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.169
O'HARA, WRITE THIS DOWN.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.175
I DON'T HAVE
A PEN.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.175
MAKE NOTE
OF THE DATE AND TIME

25:57.220 --> 25:58.312
THAT I, CARLTON LASSITER,

25:58.350 --> 25:59.749
ACTUALLY SHUT SHAWN SPENCER'S

25:59.790 --> 26:01.678
CAVERNOUS PIEHOLE.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.848
[mumbles]

26:04.890 --> 26:06.755
SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?

26:06.790 --> 26:09.918
SOMETHING
ABOUT NIGHT OF THE COMET.

26:09.960 --> 26:17.196
JUST--JUST FORGET IT.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.867
OKAY, WE NEED
TO EXPEDITE THIS.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.161
MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY.

26:20.210 --> 26:21.632
(Juliet)
WE RECEIVED A TIP

26:21.680 --> 26:22.738
THAT VLAD HAD BEEN USING

26:22.780 --> 26:24.338
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND'S CABIN
ON THE LAKE.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.245
WHEN WE WENT BACK AND RAN
SOME OF HIS CREDIT CARDS,

26:26.280 --> 26:27.269
WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE
WAS USED

26:27.310 --> 26:29.210
AT THE COLD SPRING GAS STATION.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.342
ON HIGHWAY 154.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.689
YUP, AND THE ATTENDANT THERE
SAID THAT HE'D REMEMBERED

26:32.720 --> 26:34.688
SEEING VLAD THREE DAYS AGO,
AND THAT HE GOT INTO A CAR

26:34.720 --> 26:35.948
WITH SEVERAL OTHER MEN.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.287
WHICH WE ASSUME
IS OUR RUSSIAN CONNECTION.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.788
YOU SEE, BOYS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

26:39.830 --> 26:41.024
GOOD OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK

26:41.060 --> 26:42.357
ALWAYS WINS OUT.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.321
OLD-FASHIONED.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.362
SO YOU WENT AND BILLY-CLUBBED
SOME IMMIGRANTS?

26:58.310 --> 27:00.073
YOU KNOW, JULES,
IT'S A SHAME

27:00.110 --> 27:01.316
YOU DIDN'T SEE MY KICK
AT PRACTICE.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.318
YEAH,
SORRY I MISSED IT.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.045
I DIDN'T.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.819
(Juliet)
OOH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.352
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING

27:09.390 --> 27:10.152
TO MAKE THIS WHOLE POLICE THING
OFFICIAL.

27:10.190 --> 27:13.250
ISN'T THIS THE SAME THING
YOU GAVE

27:13.290 --> 27:14.359
THE FORMER LAOTIAN GENERAL
WHO SELLS PEANUTS

27:14.400 --> 27:15.321
OUTSIDE THE STATION?

27:15.360 --> 27:17.419
YEAH, BUT HIS ACTUALLY SAYS
DETECTIVE ON IT.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.688
CHIEF, I NEED
A FAVOR.

27:18.730 --> 27:20.197
PLEASE DON'T RELEASE
THE INFO

27:20.230 --> 27:21.333
ABOUT FINDING VLAD'S BODY YET.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.439
COME ON.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.960
GIVE ME
ONE GOOD REASON.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.307
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE.

27:27.710 --> 27:28.938
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.244
I KNOW DEEP DOWN
IN MY PSYCHIC LOINS

27:31.280 --> 27:34.078
THAT THE RUSSIAN ANGLE
IS COMPLETELY WRONG.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.314
WHY, BECAUSE ALL SIGNS
POINT DIRECTLY TO IT?

27:35.350 --> 27:36.772
EXACTLY.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.787
WHOEVER DID THIS
THINKS THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.947
WE RELEASE THE INFO NOW,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA RUN.

27:39.990 --> 27:41.116
GIVE ME ONE DAY.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.287
IT'S GONNA TAKE US
AT LEAST 24 HOURS

27:43.320 --> 27:45.459
TO FIND AND NOTIFY THEM
IN RUSSIA.

27:45.490 --> 27:46.684
THAT GIVES YOU ONE DAY.

27:46.730 --> 27:47.822
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.396
COME ON, GUS.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.964
OH, LASSIE.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.092
YOUR HAIRCUT'S WORSE

27:53.130 --> 27:54.097
THAN JOYCE HYSER'S

27:54.140 --> 27:55.232
IN JUST ONE OF THE GUYS.

27:55.270 --> 27:56.362
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
[laughs]

28:03.750 --> 28:05.069
WHY ISN'T MY DAD
PICKING UP?

28:05.110 --> 28:06.475
PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

28:06.510 --> 28:08.410
AT HIS HOUSE THREE HOURS AGO
FOR YOUR APOLOGY DINNER.

28:08.450 --> 28:09.872
YEAH, WELL,
WE'LL HAVE A LATE DINNER.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.319
LATE?
IT'S ALREADY 10:00, SHAWN.

28:11.350 --> 28:12.419
WAY PAST CURFEW.

28:12.450 --> 28:13.439
WE'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT,

28:13.490 --> 28:15.355
AND YOU MIGHT END UP LOSING
YOUR ROSTER SPOT.

28:15.390 --> 28:16.482
WHY DID WE COME BACK HERE?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.418
BECAUSE THE ANSWER
TO WHAT HAPPENED TO VLAD

28:17.460 --> 28:18.484
IS WITH THE TEAM.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.851
THE WARRIORS LIED
ABOUT BEING FRIENDS WITH HIM.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.754
AND DREW REFERRED TO HIM
IN THE PAST TENSE.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.222
YEAH, WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HIM.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.760
SO THE GUYS WERE WITH VLAD
AT THE LAKE,

28:25.800 --> 28:26.767
BUT THEY LIED ABOUT IT.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.767
EXACTLY.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.994
SOMETHING WENT DOWN.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.393
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
OR WHO ELSE WAS THERE.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.429
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

28:31.470 --> 28:33.301
BE CAREFUL.
THERE'S A COVER-UP HERE.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.477
A LOT OF GUYS HATED VLAD.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.273
ANYBODY COULD BE INVOLVED.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.744
[shouts]

28:54.300 --> 28:56.495
(Larry)
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.191
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

28:58.230 --> 28:59.959
DUDE, I THINK
WE'RE ON TOP OF THE STADIUM.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.297
DO NOT STEP FORWARD.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.535
(Larry)
YOU CAN EITHER JUMP

29:03.570 --> 29:04.969
OR GET PUSHED OFF.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.466
YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO DECIDE.

29:06.510 --> 29:07.829
FIVE,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.939
FOUR, THREE...

29:09.980 --> 29:10.969
OH, COME ON!

29:11.010 --> 29:12.807
TWO...ONE!

29:12.850 --> 29:14.477
[screams]
(Matt)
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

29:14.520 --> 29:15.509
(Vince)
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

29:15.550 --> 29:16.847
ENOUGH ALREADY.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.847
IT'S MATT AND VINCE.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.187
WE MIGHT BE SCREWED.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.482
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.249
YOU CAN BLOW THIS WHOLE THING
FOR ALL OF US.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.985
(Larry)
WE'RE ONLY TRYING
To SCARE 'EM.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.327
COACH IS NOT GONNA FIND OUT.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.828
(Matt)
HELL, YES, HE CAN.
AND THERE GOES OUR CONTRACTS.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.794
YOU GET THESE GUYS
OFF THIS BUILDING

29:29.830 --> 29:31.422
AND INTO THEIR ROOMS
NOW.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.495
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TAKE THE HOODS OFF.

29:33.530 --> 29:34.497
SHOW'S OVER.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.859
[laughter]

29:35.900 --> 29:37.492
[both sigh]

29:37.540 --> 29:38.837
OH!
WHOA!

29:39.510 --> 29:41.876
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
GUYS.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.537
BEER?

29:43.580 --> 29:45.104
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO?

29:45.150 --> 29:46.879
HAZE US?
IT'S TRAINING CAMP.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.811
YOU KNOW, IT GETS SO INTENSE,
YOU GOTTA CUT LOOSE A LITTLE.

29:49.850 --> 29:50.475
WHAT WAS ALL THAT STUFF

29:50.520 --> 29:52.147
WITH MATT AND VINCE ABOUT?

29:52.190 --> 29:53.384
YOU DON'T HAVE
GUARANTEED CONTRACTS,

29:53.420 --> 29:54.853
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

29:54.890 --> 29:56.482
JUST DON'T TELL COACH
WHAT WE DID.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.988
ALL RIGHT?

29:59.030 --> 30:00.054
COME ON, GUYS.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.593
[sighs]

30:03.630 --> 30:05.166
OH, GOSH.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.089
DUDE, I GOT IT.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.334
WE NEED TO TALK
TO SAMMY.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.337
HE ALWAYS WORKS LATE.

30:10.370 --> 30:11.359
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

30:11.410 --> 30:12.559
I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT
ON THE WAY.

30:12.610 --> 30:13.531
[knock at door]

30:16.510 --> 30:18.876
SHAWN, YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON
I WANT TO SEE RIGHT NOW.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.502
I KNOW, I KNOW,
AND I'M SORRY.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.518
I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP
TO YOU, I PROMISE.

30:22.550 --> 30:26.008
UH, DO YOU--DO YOU STILL HAVE
THAT FOOTBALL,

30:26.050 --> 30:27.142
THE THUNDERBIRDS FOOTBALL

30:27.190 --> 30:28.384
THAT I GOT
WHEN I WAS A KID?

30:28.420 --> 30:30.285
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE UP IN THE ATTIC. WHY?

30:30.320 --> 30:33.426
I WANT HIM
TO SIGN IT.

30:35.430 --> 30:38.593
HENRY, THAT STEAK
WAS DOWNRIGHT VICIOUS, BABY.

30:38.630 --> 30:39.597
I MEAN,
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OVER.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.632
I--YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

30:41.670 --> 30:42.489
I HAD A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.008
YOU KIDDING?
SAMMY WINSLOW AT MY HOUSE.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.507
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.633
OR YOU COULD THANK ME,
SINCE I BROUGHT HIM OVER,

30:48.680 --> 30:49.578
BUT IT'S NEITHER HERE
NOR THERE.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.146
DO YOU KNOW
THAT SHAWN AND I USED TO SIT

30:51.180 --> 30:52.477
IN THAT LIVING ROOM
RIGHT THERE

30:52.510 --> 30:53.499
AND WATCH EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF YOUR GAMES?

30:53.550 --> 30:54.369
YOU REMEMBER THAT, SHAWN?

30:54.420 --> 30:56.638
REMEMBER?
I REMEMBER I HAD TO STAND

30:56.680 --> 31:00.218
NEXT TO THE FRIDGE
FOR THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF

31:00.250 --> 31:01.251
OF THE PLAYOFF GAME
AGAINST SEATTLE

31:01.290 --> 31:02.314
IN '88 BECAUSE EVERY TIME

31:02.360 --> 31:03.611
I GOT AN OTTER POP,

31:03.660 --> 31:04.649
YOU THREW A TOUCHDOWN.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.180
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO JINX IT.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.549
HA, HEY, WE WON,
RIGHT?

31:07.590 --> 31:08.659
YES, WE DID.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.258
[laughs]

31:10.300 --> 31:12.063
AH!

31:13.500 --> 31:14.489
(Henry)
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

31:14.540 --> 31:15.893
THAT YOU LET SHAWN TALK YOU

31:15.940 --> 31:17.567
INTO THIS CRAZY PLAN.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.999
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE KID DOES HAVE

31:19.040 --> 31:20.234
A WAY WITH WORDS.

31:20.270 --> 31:21.578
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE
IF HE'S A GENIUS,

31:21.610 --> 31:23.635
OR IF HE'S TOTALLY FULL
OF IT.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.545
MAYBE HE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF BOTH.

31:25.580 --> 31:26.569
[laughs]

31:29.520 --> 31:31.340
GET US
A COUPLE MORE BEERS.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.539
YOU GOT IT.
THAN KS.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.217
HU-UH.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.309
[laughs]

31:39.630 --> 31:41.257
[sighs]

31:41.300 --> 31:44.360
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT RETIRING THIS YEAR.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.699
BUT NOW...I CAN'T GO OUT
LIKE THIS.

31:47.730 --> 31:51.268
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE BEFORE
WOULD JUST BE FORGOTTEN.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.507
SAMMY, IF--
IF YOU FOUND OUT

31:54.540 --> 31:56.974
THAT YOU HAD PLAYERS
THAT WERE HAZING,

31:57.010 --> 31:58.204
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
ABOUT IT?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.617
USED TO BE
I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

32:01.650 --> 32:03.174
BUT THAT ALL CHANGED
LAST YEAR

32:03.220 --> 32:05.484
WHEN I PUT BEHAVIOR CLAUSES
IN EVERYBODY'S CONTRACT.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.418
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:06.450 --> 32:09.283
WELL, WE HAD SO MANY GUYS
GETTING IN TROUBLE

32:09.320 --> 32:11.584
OFF THE FIELD,
YOU KNOW, GETTING ARRESTED,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.621
DRIVING THEIR MOTORCYCLES
THROUGH HONEYBAKED HAM STORES,

32:13.660 --> 32:16.026
STUFF LIKE THAT.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.652
SO I PUT A THING
IN EVERYONE'S DEAL

32:17.700 --> 32:19.964
THAT SAYS IF THEY GET CAUGHT
DOING ANY OF THAT STUFF,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.695
THAT I CAN CUT THEM.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.638
NO EXCEPTIONS.

32:22.670 --> 32:26.731
NONE. THE ONLY THING
THEY RESPOND TO IS FEAR.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.635
FEAR OF LOSING
THEIR MONEY.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.001
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT
THAT FEAR TO WORK FOR US.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.126
(man)
GOOD JOB, BOYS!

32:51.170 --> 32:53.365
HOLD UP, HOLD UP!

32:53.400 --> 32:55.766
(Sammy)
WELL, VLAD'S DEATH
IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.109
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SANTA
BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

32:58.140 --> 33:00.131
TO HELP IN ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.638
AND WE VOTED AS A TEAM
TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE

33:02.680 --> 33:04.671
AND TO PLAY, AND THAT IS
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.371
THANK YOU.

33:06.410 --> 33:07.672
AT LEAST TELL US
WHO THE KICKER'S GONNA BE.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.575
THANK YOU.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.718
YOU KNOW, I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, KID.

33:13.750 --> 33:14.580
YOU GOT MY CAREER--

33:14.620 --> 33:16.781
HELL, YOU GOT MY LEGACY
IN YOUR HANDS.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.493
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.239
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LOOK
AT THE BALL.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.033
YOU AIN'T MAD AT IT,
THOUGH.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.300
[shouting]

33:37.340 --> 33:39.274
HEY.
[blows whistle]

33:41.650 --> 33:43.242
WE'RE FOUR WEEKS
FROM OUR FIRST GAME.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.747
YOU'RE STILL PULLING THIS?
COME ON, BABY.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.517
DUDE, MATT AND DREW
ARE GETTING INTO IT.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.585
I THINK THE PRESSURE'S
GETTING TO THEM.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.156
WHERE ARE YOUR JOHN STOCKTON
SHORTS?

33:52.190 --> 33:53.680
THEY'RE NOT JOHN STOCKTON
SHORTS, SHAWN.

33:53.730 --> 33:56.494
I CHANGED BECAUSE I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH JULIET.

33:56.530 --> 33:58.225
SHE WANTS US TO COME DOWN
TO THE STATION RIGHT NOW.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.328
CHECK THIS OUT.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.691
ACCORDING TO HER,
VLAD WASN'T MURDERED.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.833
WHAT?
SAY THAT AGAIN.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.167
USE A JAMAICAN ACCENT.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.507
ME SAID VLAD
NO MURDER.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.666
THE MURDER THING CAN'T WORK.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.075
NO, MAN.
THE MAN'S FEET--

34:09.110 --> 34:09.804
SHAWN.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.808
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.499
(Juliet)
AND ACCORDING TO THE CORONER,

34:13.550 --> 34:15.177
VLAD'S INJURIES WERE
MORE CONSISTENT

34:15.220 --> 34:18.542
WITH THOSE
OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.478
(Shawn)
WELL, MY PSYCHIC WIRES
ARE CROSSED THEN.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.648
'CAUSE I CAN SEE VLAD'S BODY,
BUT I DON'T SEE

34:23.690 --> 34:25.578
ANY SHARDS OF GLASS
OR CUTS ON IT ANYWHERE.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.325
MM. GOOD CATCH.
I'M GLAD I CALLED YOU.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.294
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T CALL ME
TO SEE ME IN MY UNIFORM?

34:29.330 --> 34:31.298
'CAUSE I GOT A GLIMPSE
OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR EARLIER,

34:31.330 --> 34:33.161
AND I WAS LIKE WHA-AT!

34:33.200 --> 34:35.691
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE PADS
IN EXTRA SMALL.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.093
WHOA.
HEY.

34:37.140 --> 34:38.300
DEAD RUSSIAN GUY.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.262
POSSIBLE HOMICIDAL
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.175
RIGHT.
SORRY, GUS.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.102
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

34:45.150 --> 34:46.139
THEY'RE VLAD'S.

34:52.850 --> 34:57.253
[shouts and grunts]

34:57.290 --> 34:58.279
WARRIORS!

34:58.330 --> 35:01.197
I'M GETTING SOMETHING HERE.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.754
OLDER REPUBLICAN WALRUSES.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.392
NO, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

35:04.430 --> 35:05.795
EVERYONE KNOWS WALRUSES
ARE LIBERTARIAN.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.821
OFF--OFF--OFF--

35:07.870 --> 35:09.167
OFFLAGEN.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.269
OFF--OFF--

35:10.300 --> 35:11.665
RIXPER--OFF--

35:11.710 --> 35:13.132
ON--OFF--

35:13.170 --> 35:15.832
SHAWN.
OFF-ROAD WARRIORS.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.836
OFF-ROAD LIKE ATV.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.145
YOU KNOW WHAT,
ATVS DON'T HAVE WINDSHIELDS.

35:29.690 --> 35:32.386
WE HAVE TO GO.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.591
ALL RIGHT,
I THINK I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

35:34.630 --> 35:35.722
BUT I NEED
A LITTLE MORE PROOF.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.853
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT THE TIME OF DEATH.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.198
IT HAPPENED BETWEEN 4:00
AND 6:00 ON THURSDAY THE 14TH.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.790
THAT TEXT CAME IN FIVE HOURS
AFTER HE ALREADY DIED.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.660
WOULD YOU SEND
A THREATENING TEXT MESSAGE

35:44.710 --> 35:46.632
TO SOMEONE HOURS AFTER YOU
SUPPOSEDLY KILLED THEM?

35:46.670 --> 35:48.638
YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE STARTING
THE COVER-UP.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
FIND IN MATT AND VINCE'S LOCKER?

35:50.540 --> 35:52.940
SOMETHING THAT TIES THEM
DIRECTLY TO VLAD.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.175
(Gus)
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE BEAT US
TO IT.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.175
IT'S NOT ONE
OF THEIR LOCKERS.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.175
WHOSE IS IT?

35:57.220 --> 35:58.448
IT'S MINE.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.855
WHY DID YOU EVEN HAVE TO KEEP
THAT STUPID THING?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.720
IT'S MY ONLY FORM
OF I.D., GUS.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.193
HEY.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.539
HEY, BROS.
WHAT'S UP?

36:14.570 --> 36:15.832
WHAT'S UP?

36:15.870 --> 36:18.430
WHAT'S UP IS WE KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A KICKER.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.563
YOU GUYS SAW ME NAIL
A 69-FOOTER A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.498
THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
WORKING FOR THE COPS?

36:22.540 --> 36:24.599
OKAY, OKAY.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.675
SO MAYBE I'M NOT A PLAYER,

36:26.710 --> 36:28.575
I'M NOT A PLAYER,
BUT I CRUSH A LOT.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.575
[exhales]

36:29.620 --> 36:31.281
WOW, I WOULD HAVE BET MONEY

36:31.320 --> 36:32.389
THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
THAT REFERENCE.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.217
I GOT IT.
THANKS, BUDDY.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.249
ALL RIGHT,
THE JIG IS UP.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.279
I'M A PSYCHIC.
I WORK FOR THE COPS.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.323
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M TIRED
OF YOU MESSING WITH US.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.782
WHOA, WHOA-WHOA.

36:40.830 --> 36:41.922
WHAT WAS THAT?

36:41.960 --> 36:43.291
I SAID I'M TIRED OF YOU
MESSING WITH US.

36:43.330 --> 36:44.467
NOT YOU.

36:48.370 --> 36:49.792
IT'S VLAD.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.603
HE'S SPEAKING TO ME.
HE'S IN A DARK PLACE.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.403
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.308
HE ALSO HAS
SOME RITZ BITS IN HIS MOUTH.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.908
CHEESE,
NO, PEANUT BUTTER.

36:59.950 --> 37:02.009
SHAWN.
OKAY, I'LL TELL 'EM.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.642
I SAID I'D TELL 'EM.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.511
ALL RIGHT, VLAD SAYS
HE KNOWS IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.680
OH, I'M SEEING
THROUGH VLAD'S EYES NOW.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.019
HE INVITED YOU
TO GO ATVing DOWN BY THE LAKE.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.027
YOU WERE DRINKING.

37:14.060 --> 37:14.992
THERE WAS A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT

37:15.030 --> 37:17.919
WHERE VLAD AND MATT SMASHED
INTO EACH OTHER

37:17.960 --> 37:19.325
LIKE TWO FROZEN CHRISTMAS HAMS.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.860
VLAD WASN'T WEARING
HIS HELMET.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.733
HIT HIS HEAD ON A ROCK,
AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE,

37:23.770 --> 37:26.432
HE WAS DEAD.
SHUT UP, DREW.

37:26.470 --> 37:27.664
MATT, YOU WERE THROWN
SO VIOLENTLY FROM THE ATV

37:27.710 --> 37:29.530
THAT THE EMERGENCY SWITCH
TETHERED TO YOUR WRIST

37:29.580 --> 37:30.672
LEFT A BURN JUST LIKE VLAD.

37:30.710 --> 37:31.677
AND THE FOOT,
THE FOOT--

37:31.710 --> 37:32.779
[imitates tearing]

37:32.810 --> 37:34.414
JUST GOT RIPPED OFF
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACCIDENT.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.338
BUT YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING ANY OF THAT,

37:36.380 --> 37:38.439
SO YOU HAD TO COVER IT UP

37:38.490 --> 37:39.843
OR RISK LOSING YOUR CONTRACT,
AND THAT'S WORTH MILLIONS.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.881
SMALLPOX, WRAPPING UP
THE WRAP-UP.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.456
WHAT?
PUTTING A BOW ON IT.

37:43.490 --> 37:44.855
THE POX MAY BE SMALL--

37:44.890 --> 37:47.529
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY, REALLY
VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE, GUYS.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.528
TOO BAD WE'VE ALREADY DUG
OURSELVES SO DEEP

37:49.560 --> 37:51.494
WE CAN'T LET YOU EVER TELL
ANYONE ABOUT IT.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.667
THEN AGAIN,
I COULD BE DEAD WRONG.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.962
YUP.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.332
I MEAN, I JUST--I JUST HEARD IT
ALL FROM A LOCKER.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.359
WHAT THE HELL
DOES IT KNOW?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.958
SERIOUSLY, HERE'S WHAT I THINK
WE SHOULD DO, GUYS.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.068
GUS, RUN.
YUP.

38:00.110 --> 38:03.307
[shouts]

38:08.620 --> 38:09.575
GUS!

38:09.620 --> 38:10.871
THIS WAY!

38:13.550 --> 38:15.984
WE'LL USE THE PHONE
IN THE PRESS BOX.

38:16.020 --> 38:19.080
COME ON, GUS, THIS IS
WHAT WE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.519
I WAS A TRAINING INTERN,
SHAWN!

38:21.560 --> 38:24.495
[gasping]

38:25.770 --> 38:27.829
GUESS YOU GUYS DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE ELEVATOR.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.007
WAIT!

38:33.040 --> 38:34.007
GET OVER THERE.
GET OVER THERE.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.371
WHAT ARE WE DOING,
MATT?

38:35.410 --> 38:36.377
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MATT?

38:36.410 --> 38:37.377
DON'T BE RASH AND STUPID NOW

38:37.410 --> 38:39.901
AFTER YOU COVERED UP
THE VLAD ACCIDENT SO NICELY.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.372
THAT'S RIGHT.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.512
I KNOW.

38:42.550 --> 38:43.869
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
NO, WE DON'T. NO, WE DON'T.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.944
(Shawn)
I SENSED A PLAN BEING HATCHED
RIGHT THERE IN THE MOMENT.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.083
YOU KNEW VLAD WAS
IN TROUBLE WITH THE RUSSIANS.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.781
YOU GUYS DECIDED
THAT WOULD BE THE STORY.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.481
YOU DUMPED VLAD'S BODY
IN THE LAKE,

38:50.520 --> 38:52.351
AND YOU LEFT THE FOOT
RIGHT OUT THERE,

38:52.390 --> 38:54.119
WHERE YOU WERE SURE
IT WOULD BE FOUND.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.991
YOU GAVE THE COPS
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED.

38:56.030 --> 38:57.952
IT WAS THE TEXT,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.423
MAN, THE TEXT TO VLAD'S PHONE
AFTERWARDS.

39:00.470 --> 39:01.630
THAT WAS OVERKILL.
THAT'S WHAT COST YOU.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.069
WE HAVE TO GET RID
OF 'EM, MATT.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.067
(Gus)
NO, YOU DON'T.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.431
WE KNOW
YOU'RE NOT MURDERERS.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.437
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.368
YEAH, THAT WE COVERED UP.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.731
YEAH.
YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT OUR CONTRACTS.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.543
WE'RE GOING TO JAIL.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.672
JAIL'S NOT SO BAD.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.075
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN STIR CRAZY?

39:14.110 --> 39:15.611
I BET THEY'LL LET YOU
RIDE BULLS.

39:15.650 --> 39:17.971
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE 'EM UP TO THE ROOF,

39:18.020 --> 39:19.510
MAKE 'EM JUMP.

39:19.550 --> 39:20.744
IT'LL LOOK
LIKE A HAZING GONE BAD.

39:20.790 --> 39:21.950
COME ON.
NO, NO, NO.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.984
HEY, HEY-HEY.

39:24.020 --> 39:24.987
LET GO OF 'EM.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.622
COACH .

39:26.660 --> 39:28.753
SON.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.529
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:30.560 --> 39:32.960
WATCHING FILM
IN THE COACH'S BOX,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.695
LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT
BEFORE A GAME.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.766
YEAH,
AND I HEARD EVERYTHING.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.109
COACH, COME ON.
THINK ABOUT THIS.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.505
GIVING UP THREE
OF YOUR STARTERS

39:41.540 --> 39:43.405
FOR THESE GUYS?

39:43.440 --> 39:45.146
YOU CAN'T WIN
WITHOUT US.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.717
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

39:50.750 --> 39:51.944
WHAT?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.810
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER
ANYMORE.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.752
SHAWN, YOU AND YOUR DAD
ARE PEOPLE

39:56.790 --> 39:58.826
WHO LOVE FOOTBALL
SO MUCH

39:58.860 --> 40:01.021
YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO BE CLOSE TO IT.

40:01.060 --> 40:04.496
AND THAT MADE ME REALIZE
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.760
THE GAME.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.165
ALL RIGHT,
TO HELL WITH YOU, OLD MAN.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.861
WE'LL JUST GET RID
OF YOU TOO.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.867
[overlapping shouts]

40:10.900 --> 40:12.037
FREEZE.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.958
COP!

40:14.010 --> 40:15.602
(Shawn)
HA-HA, LOOK AT THAT.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.471
HA HA HA.

40:17.510 --> 40:19.603
YOU THINK I'D DO ALL THIS
WITHOUT HAVING BACK-UP?

40:19.650 --> 40:20.548
I'M NOT STUPID.

40:20.580 --> 40:23.140
THEY DON'T GIVE THESE BADGES
TO JUST ANYBODY.

40:23.180 --> 40:24.545
FEEL IT.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.909
(Winslow)
YOU GUYS DID GOOD.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.815
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

40:27.850 --> 40:30.114
OH.
THAN KS, SAM MY.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.957
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT NEED

40:31.990 --> 40:33.218
A FEW EXTRA PLAYERS
FOR THE SEASON.

40:33.260 --> 40:34.454
NO.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.626
BUT, YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW--

40:35.660 --> 40:36.649
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.655
(Shawn)
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

40:37.700 --> 40:42.194
NEVER.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.138
(male sports announcer)
HELLO, EVERYONE.

40:43.170 --> 40:44.808
WELCOME TO THUNDER DOME
FOR OPENING NIGHT,

40:44.840 --> 40:45.909
AS HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL

40:45.940 --> 40:47.908
FOR COACH SAMMY WINSLOW
AND THE T-BIRDS.

40:47.940 --> 40:49.134
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

40:49.180 --> 40:50.772
I'M ACTUALLY LETTING HIM
DO THIS.

40:50.810 --> 40:52.107
YOU REMEMBER BACK THEN
I TOLD YOU

40:52.150 --> 40:54.516
HE WAS A PERCEPTIVE
LITTLE PAIN IN THE BUTT?

40:54.550 --> 40:57.144
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ALSO
TOLD YOU

40:57.180 --> 40:58.716
THAT HE IS PERSISTENT
AS HELL.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.149
[chuckles]

41:00.190 --> 41:02.078
WHEW.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.588
[breathes heavily]

41:04.630 --> 41:05.585
READY?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.881
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

41:06.930 --> 41:09.194
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE READY
FOR ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.828
READY TO LEAD 'EM OUT,
SON.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.189

41:33.650 --> 41:34.548
THE CASE IS OVER.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.717
WHAT DO YOU AND SHAWN
WANT ME TO SEE ANYWAY?

41:36.760 --> 41:37.784
[shouts]

41:37.820 --> 41:40.527
THAT.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.061
