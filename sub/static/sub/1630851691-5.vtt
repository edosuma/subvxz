Oy.

Amy:
<i> I read all the books.</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:05.103
Terri:
<i> My sister was my doula.</i>

Terri:

00:10.644 --> 00:11.710
When they took him.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.979

00:15.016 --> 00:16.748
Jen:
<i> I breastfed her.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:17.583
Napped.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.184
Lyle was sobbing.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.485
Woke up-

00:21.355 --> 00:23.321
There were two
cops at the door.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.190
(indigenous vocables)
(car doors slamming)

00:25.192 --> 00:26.458

00:30.330 --> 00:32.263
Margaret:
<i> They handed me a card</i>
<i> from some social workers.</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:33.398
(baby crying)
stay the hell away
from my nephew.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.467
"we took your little girl,
here's a card".

00:35.536 --> 00:37.436
Ronnie:
<i> Don't touch me, no.</i>

00:37.571 --> 00:38.503
Baby was gone.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.538
No one would explain.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.472
No!
(baby crying)

00:40.541 --> 00:42.340
He's my nephew!
He's my family!

00:43.377 --> 00:45.677
They planned to
take her all along.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.045
Ivy:
<i> I didn't do anything!</i>

00:47.815 --> 00:49.214
Ronnie:
<i> He's my nephew!</i>

00:49.283 --> 00:50.282
(baby crying)

00:50.284 --> 00:51.683
It's okay, I'm here.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.686
It took years to
get him back.

00:54.821 --> 00:57.155
Ronnie maloney, you're
under arrest for kidnapping.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.290
(baby crying)
jen:
<i> I never got her home.</i>

00:58.359 --> 00:59.892
(baby crying)

00:59.894 --> 01:03.095
Margaret:
<i> She had a lot of problems,</i>
<i>being in the system for so long.</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:04.096
Trauma.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.163
Nicholas!

01:05.199 --> 01:06.632
(nicholas cries)

01:06.767 --> 01:07.633
She doesn't want
to see me now.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.167
Ronnie:
<i> You can't have him!</i>

01:09.303 --> 01:11.603
Give us back my nephew!

01:11.738 --> 01:14.439
(siren blaring)
(indigenous vocables)

01:14.441 --> 01:15.641
Ivy:
<i> I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

01:16.710 --> 01:18.577
I'm all he has.
I just want him back.

01:18.579 --> 01:24.650
(indigenous vocables)

01:24.785 --> 01:26.184
This is amazing work, amish.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.253
Can you just maybe

01:28.255 --> 01:31.190
Snip that last line of
margaret's though?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.391
If I'm gonna get this
class action certified,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.828
The video and the
affidavits all need to show

01:35.963 --> 01:37.863
The harm suffered by
the women is the same.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.931
I just don't understand
how it's legal

01:39.967 --> 01:41.700
For the government to
take someone's child

01:41.769 --> 01:43.101
With no warning.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.036
I hope they get a
million dollars each.

01:45.106 --> 01:48.006
Well right now we're just trying
to get this policy overturned.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.509
Amish:
<i> Give 'em hell.</i>

01:51.812 --> 01:53.011
I'm gonna try.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.613
Thanks.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.484
Your honour,

01:58.619 --> 01:59.885
We're submitting
these affidavits

01:59.954 --> 02:01.487
And the
accompanying video

02:01.622 --> 02:04.222
As evidence of similar
harm this province's

02:04.258 --> 02:06.224
Birth alert policy
caused my clients.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.192
Scott:
<i> Your honour,</i>

02:07.261 --> 02:08.927
These are
moving stories,

02:08.929 --> 02:10.429
No question.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.297
But the personal
accounts of all
these women,

02:12.299 --> 02:13.499
From all walks
of life,

02:13.634 --> 02:14.966
Does not a
class action make.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.036
Marcie:
<i> These women are either</i>
<i> indigenous or black,</i>

02:18.105 --> 02:19.171
They're all poor.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.840
And they all suffered
an emotional devastation

02:21.975 --> 02:24.843
As a result of this
province's birth alert policy.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.645
My friend here has
yet to demonstrate

02:26.647 --> 02:27.979
A uniformity of harm.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.448
The affidavits that I provided
the court will show this.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.683
Scott:
<i> With respect,</i>
<i> all I'm hearing</i>
<i> ms. Diggs say</i>

02:31.719 --> 02:34.619
<i> Is that the race</i>
<i> and economic status</i>
<i> of her clients</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.454
Makes their
experiences
identical?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.956
I'm sorry,
but I find that
offensive.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.660
Mr. Riley, that has to be one
of the most cynical rounds

02:41.662 --> 02:43.795
Of sophistry I've
heard in my life.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.463
And I spend my
days with lawyers.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.732
<i> Thank you both.</i>

02:46.867 --> 02:49.000
<i> First thing tomorrow,</i>
<i> I'll give you my ruling.</i>

02:51.438 --> 02:53.471
Colleen:
<i> Marcie! Hi!</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:54.940
Marcie:
<i> Hey col-</i>

02:55.809 --> 02:56.908
Good morning,
your honour.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.111
<i> I heard about</i>
<i> the judgeship.</i>

02:59.113 --> 03:00.178
Congrats.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.446
Thanks.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.415
I just felt like I
needed a change,

03:03.484 --> 03:04.749
You know, with
everyone leaving,

03:04.818 --> 03:06.618
It seemed like
the right time.

03:07.554 --> 03:08.620
For the record,

03:08.656 --> 03:11.122
Some of us
weren't given
much of a choice.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.226
And look at you,

03:14.361 --> 03:16.294
You've never
looked happier.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.295
<i> Getting to fight</i>
<i> the good fight</i>

03:17.364 --> 03:19.297
<i> With a blank cheque</i>
<i> in your back pocket.</i>

03:19.333 --> 03:20.632
Oh, to dream.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.767
Let's just hope the
dream doesn't
become a nightmare.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.639
Stop looking for
the rain, marcie.

03:28.275 --> 03:31.109
(smooth jazzy music)

03:31.178 --> 03:32.444
I don't do that.

03:33.447 --> 03:41.319
(smooth jazzy music)

03:41.388 --> 03:43.855
(marcie sighs)

03:43.891 --> 03:45.590
Like the new digs.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.193
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:48.262 --> 03:49.727
I thought your
silicon valley
friend

03:49.763 --> 03:51.529
Would've had you
installed in a
glass tower.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.365
I'm not a glass tower
kind of girl.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.968
<i> How's clayton park</i>
<i> treating ya?</i>

03:58.205 --> 03:59.871
It is what it is.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.241
You ever think about
making a change?

04:02.376 --> 04:05.009
Ah, not really a glass
tower kinda girl either.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.478
Marcie:
<i> No glass tower.</i>

04:06.547 --> 04:09.114
No office actually
at the moment.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.215
<i> What's more</i>
<i> important to me</i>

04:10.217 --> 04:12.550
Is getting a good
team together.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.489
(sighs) I'm good.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.225
Was there anything else?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.496
Ah, yeah, a favour.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.100
Ah, my client ivy,
16, in foster care,

04:28.102 --> 04:29.034
<i> She just had a baby-</i>

04:29.103 --> 04:30.235
Yeah, I know ivy.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.337
She was dealing
with a birth alert.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.305
<i> How'd it go?</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:34.839
Marcie:
<i> Bad.</i>

04:34.908 --> 04:36.374
Baby ended up in care,

04:36.510 --> 04:38.243
And now ivy has
just gotten word

04:38.245 --> 04:41.046
That he's in a foster
family in cape breton.

04:41.048 --> 04:41.880
Cape breton!

04:41.949 --> 04:44.515
Marcie:
<i> Yeah. Ivy's in school.</i>

04:44.517 --> 04:45.884
<i> There's no way</i>
<i> she's gonna see him</i>

04:46.019 --> 04:47.085
All the way out there.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.453
I got it.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.721
(rhythmic ambient music)

04:49.790 --> 04:51.255
Thanks, girl.

04:51.292 --> 04:55.293
(rhythmic ambient music)

04:55.296 --> 04:57.228
(chuckles) yeah, I can
think of worse places

04:57.264 --> 04:59.264
In a pandemic to be
stuck than santiago.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.298
Lawyer 2:
<i> Leave it to mueller!</i>

05:00.433 --> 05:02.267
I ended up in my mother's
basement for four weeks.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.368
Avery:
<i> I'll tell you what,</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:05.203
<i> I did learn to make a</i>
<i> pretty mean paella.</i>

05:05.339 --> 05:06.171
(man laughing)

05:06.240 --> 05:07.139
Avery:
<i> It was good, it was good.</i>

05:07.274 --> 05:08.206
(glass breaking)

05:08.242 --> 05:09.274
Carmen:
<i> Having a nice lunch</i>

05:09.409 --> 05:11.176
<i> Laughing about all the</i>
<i> lives you've destroyed?</i>

05:11.245 --> 05:12.877
What's your problem, lady?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.078
Hey.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.347
Hey!

05:15.482 --> 05:16.748
<i> What the hell</i>
<i> is that about?</i>

05:17.785 --> 05:19.283
You don't even remember me.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.285
Just another day at
the office, right?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.890
I-I, I prosecuted you?

05:28.629 --> 05:29.895
It's carmen.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.964
(stammering) the
sexual assault case.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.766
Sexual assault of a minor.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.502
Pretty key detail
for a teacher.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.237
Listen, we withdrew
the charges.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.574
You think that matters?

05:42.643 --> 05:45.510
You think the search results
ever go away for a story like:

05:45.512 --> 05:48.479
"grade six teacher charged
with assaulting a student"?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.117
Look, I was just doing my-

05:52.186 --> 05:53.285
Your job?

05:53.420 --> 05:56.221
Yeah, must be nice
having a job.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.990
<i> I haven't had a steady</i>
<i> one since I was charged.</i>

05:58.992 --> 06:01.626
Just lost another one at
maclean thanks to you.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.728
Maybe if you come by
the office I could-

06:03.731 --> 06:06.531
No. I don't want to have
a conversation with you.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.135
I just hope that
you burn in hell.

06:10.137 --> 06:16.141
(tense music)

06:16.143 --> 06:19.811
♪

06:19.813 --> 06:22.681
Ronnie, you know this
kidnapping charge is bogus

06:22.683 --> 06:23.815
But let's get our
game faces on

06:23.851 --> 06:25.751
Before the judge
gets here, okay?

06:26.820 --> 06:28.486
That's what this whole
thing is to them.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.321
<i> My life. Ivy's.</i>

06:30.357 --> 06:31.757
A game.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.492
Court registrar:
<i> All persons with matters</i>
<i> in this court please rise.</i>

06:37.898 --> 06:39.330
Colleen:
<i> Please be seated, everyone.</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:45.970
Ellery:
<i> Doctor fortune,</i>

06:46.039 --> 06:48.039
As the court has recognized
you as an expert

06:48.041 --> 06:51.209
<i> In the effectiveness of</i>
<i> child welfare programs,</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:54.045
Do you consider care harmful
to indigenous children?

06:54.114 --> 06:57.048
While I recognize the
concerns of the past,

06:57.050 --> 06:59.584
<i> I assure you that</i>
<i> the system has made</i>

06:59.719 --> 07:01.920
Very humane strides
over the years.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.189
Ellery:
<i> So one woman's</i>
<i> bad experience</i>

07:04.191 --> 07:06.524
Can't be used to condemn
an entire system?

07:06.660 --> 07:07.792
Doug:
<i> Your honour,</i>

07:07.861 --> 07:09.661
This is a simplification of
our argument to say the least.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.863
You'll get a
chance to examine.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.997
Proceed.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.999
Of course not.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.336
<i> The priority is always</i>
<i> to return a child home.</i>

07:19.072 --> 07:20.738
Assuming home is safe.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.340
And that's the key,
isn't it?

07:22.409 --> 07:23.941
Safety.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.810
<i> So how does the government's</i>
<i> birth alert policy</i>

07:25.879 --> 07:27.279
Play into this?

07:27.281 --> 07:29.080
Dr. Fortune:
<i> If the government has</i>
<i> any reason to believe</i>

07:29.116 --> 07:31.683
That a child could
be in danger,

07:31.818 --> 07:32.951
They have to act.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.487
In the best interest
of the child.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.155
Sounds pretty
reasonable to me.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.691
Doug:
Dr. Fortune,

07:39.760 --> 07:40.758
I've looked
through your resume

07:40.794 --> 07:42.026
And I see you've
published two papers

07:42.095 --> 07:44.896
On the effects of care for
youth in northern manitoba.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.031
Is that correct?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.031
Yes.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
Have you conducted research
on the effects of care

07:48.769 --> 07:50.101
On urban indigenous youth?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.102
No.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.838
What about indigenous
youth in nova scotia?

07:53.840 --> 07:54.973
No, I have not.

07:55.108 --> 07:55.874
Doug:
<i> Would you say that the</i>
<i> separation policies</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:57.075
Of the government

07:57.077 --> 07:59.110
Have led to the destruction
of indigenous families?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.379
That's beyond the scope of
my research, I'm afraid.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.315
So on one of the central
questions of this case,

08:03.450 --> 08:05.183
You have zero
insight to offer.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.485
Excuse-
I'm an academic.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.586
Objection.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.687
Colleen:
<i> That's a fair suggestion.</i>

08:08.822 --> 08:11.022
Ellery:
<i> Your honour, dr. Fortune</i>
<i> is indigenous.</i>

08:11.091 --> 08:12.557
Mr. Paul is insulting
his heritage

08:12.693 --> 08:13.925
And lived experience.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.727
Doug:
<i> I'm insulted that you</i>
<i> presented an expert</i>

08:15.796 --> 08:17.529
Who can't speak to the heart
of the matter, counsellor.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.663
Doug (clears throat)-

08:18.798 --> 08:19.798
<i> Mr. Paul,</i>

08:19.800 --> 08:21.199
Let's watch our tone.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.702
Do you have any further
questions for dr. Fortune?

08:24.505 --> 08:25.804
No, your honour,
I'm done.

08:25.806 --> 08:31.743
(tense music)

08:32.613 --> 08:33.878
Hey, look at you!

08:33.947 --> 08:35.947
Looking very heroic
and military.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.082
(reggie chuckles)

08:37.217 --> 08:38.149
Ian, this is-

08:38.185 --> 08:39.484
Louise.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.085
It's good to finally
meet the man

08:41.154 --> 08:43.621
Who launched an endless
stream of superlatives

08:43.657 --> 08:44.556
Out of this guy.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.091
Ah, come on,
let's grab a table.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.828
Finally.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.763
Got my two favourite
people together!

08:52.833 --> 08:54.766
Is it strange being
back in canada?

08:55.502 --> 08:56.501
I'm pretty jet-lagged,

08:56.503 --> 08:58.436
So everything's a little
strange right now.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.438
How's the peacekeeping biz?

09:00.440 --> 09:01.572
It's okay.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.640
We're thin on the
ground these days

09:02.676 --> 09:04.309
So there really needs
to be more deployment.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.743
I'd say that's a good thing.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.881
Fewer deployments makes
oversight easier.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.216
I guess,

09:11.351 --> 09:12.717
But at the end of the day you're
doing less good in the world.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.152
But without the
proper oversight,

09:14.154 --> 09:15.786
More bad gets done too.

09:17.991 --> 09:18.990
Ah, you know,

09:19.026 --> 09:21.159
Ian probably doesn't
want to talk about work.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.828
Ian:
<i> I'm not actually clear what</i>
<i>you mean by "proper oversight".</i>

09:23.864 --> 09:25.763
Louise:
<i> Well, it's due to a</i>
<i> lack of oversight</i>

09:25.832 --> 09:28.400
That peacekeepers don't have
the best reputation anymore-

09:28.535 --> 09:29.901
Sorry, they don't?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.403
That's a surprise to me.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.572
<i> I don't know dad,</i>
<i> what do you think?</i>

09:33.707 --> 09:35.807
Who do you think wins
the reputation olympics?

09:35.876 --> 09:37.609
Peacekeepers or lawyers?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.143
(whimsical music)

09:39.279 --> 09:41.212
(sighs) why don't we
order some wine.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.147
<i> Red or white?</i>

09:42.282 --> 09:43.281
Red's fine.
-White.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.151
(whimsical music)

09:47.220 --> 09:48.820
I'll just get a
bottle of each.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.692
(background tv chatter)

09:54.828 --> 09:55.961
Avery:
<i> Carmen was right,</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:58.696
Her search results
are a nightmare.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.831
I mean, don't these
people realize

09:59.900 --> 10:01.032
That we withdrew
the charges?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.835
But all anyone remembers are
those initial headlines.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.273
Tv reporter:
<i> And this courtroom controversy</i>
<i> went viral with the internet-</i>

10:08.275 --> 10:09.541
You have got to
be kidding me.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.009
Tv reporter:
<i> From a video used to</i>
<i> support a class action-</i>

10:11.078 --> 10:13.311
What? What's up?

10:13.446 --> 10:18.082
Tv reporter:
<i> The video posted anonymously,</i>
<i> is causing an online uproar.</i>

10:18.118 --> 10:19.851
Marcie:
<i> That's the raw video.</i>

10:21.121 --> 10:23.054
<i> How the hell did that</i>
<i> get on the internet?</i>

10:23.823 --> 10:25.123
Uh, I don't understand,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.524
Isn't this free
publicity for your case?

10:26.660 --> 10:27.758
What's the problem?

10:27.794 --> 10:31.062
(dramatic music swells)

10:34.267 --> 10:36.567
<i> Your honour, the discrepancy</i>
<i> between the affidavits,</i>

10:36.603 --> 10:38.503
<i> The video evidence</i>
<i> presented by ms. Diggs</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:40.538
<i> And the raw footage which</i>
<i> was broadcast last night</i>

10:40.607 --> 10:41.606
Is highly disturbing.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.408
Discrepancies of
basic editing.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.410
The stories themselves
remain identical.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.744
It's clear from
the raw footage,

10:46.813 --> 10:48.546
Ms. Diggs was
cherry picking her facts

10:48.682 --> 10:50.348
To intentionally
mislead this court.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.950
Nothing could be further
from the truth, your honour,

10:51.952 --> 10:53.752
I used my professional
judgement to determine whether-

10:53.754 --> 10:54.752
The edited video

10:54.888 --> 10:57.522
And the affidavits
filed imply uniformity.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.524
<i> The unedited video</i>
<i> completely refutes it.</i>

10:59.659 --> 11:01.292
Some of these women had
their children returned

11:01.294 --> 11:02.359
Mere days later.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.228
Some were given apologies,
some had-

11:04.264 --> 11:06.898
This is about how the
government's birth alert policy

11:06.967 --> 11:09.600
Uniformly wreaked havoc
on these women's lives.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.705
(tense music)

11:13.774 --> 11:17.142
Ms. Diggs, I'm sorry but the
court agrees with mr. Riley.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.211
<i> The request to have your</i>
<i> class action certified</i>

11:20.346 --> 11:21.346
Is denied.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.780
(dramatic music)

11:27.654 --> 11:29.854
Hey, cleo!

11:29.856 --> 11:30.788
Oh, hi iris.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.057
I'm just about to
meet with a client.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.125
Iris:
<i> Oh, it'll take</i>
<i> five seconds.</i>

11:34.161 --> 11:36.394
It's about ivy maloney's
baby, nicholas.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.795
I hear he's gone
to cape breton?

11:37.831 --> 11:40.131
Yeah, we found him a
great set of foster parents.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.600
It's just it's so far
away for his mother.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.335
Have you guys tried to
looking in colchester,

11:44.371 --> 11:45.270
Or the valley?

11:45.405 --> 11:46.404
You know how it works.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.806
Sure, there are
closer foster parents

11:48.942 --> 11:50.809
<i> But they don't want</i>
<i> an infant or they do,</i>

11:50.811 --> 11:52.343
But they're not
certified for infant care.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.811
Well what if I
find someone?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.279
No, we just got him settled.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.082
We can't be shuttling that
poor baby across the province

11:58.151 --> 11:59.884
Like he's a sack of mail.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.887
Isn't one more
trip worth it

12:03.022 --> 12:04.955
If it means he gets
to see his mother?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.292
Okay.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.761
Give it a whirl.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.830
Thank you!

12:11.832 --> 12:17.035
(ambient music)

12:17.037 --> 12:18.703
Marcie diggs.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.171
Marcie:
<i> Well if it isn't</i>
<i> mr. Barclay.</i>

12:20.173 --> 12:21.472
Tony:
<i> How's it going?</i>

12:22.175 --> 12:23.708
How are your folks?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.977
I think they're
gonna be fine.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.379
So why do you seem to
have your entire office

12:28.381 --> 12:29.714
Spread out on this bench?

12:29.716 --> 12:33.851
(chuckles) I'm, uh,
actually between offices

12:33.987 --> 12:34.852
At the moment.

12:34.888 --> 12:35.987
You don't need to
camp out here,

12:36.122 --> 12:37.655
You know I have
lots of space.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.059
You have that
boardroom don't you?

12:41.061 --> 12:42.727
Marcie:
<i> You know, with all</i>
<i> these clients,</i>

12:42.729 --> 12:44.395
That would come in
pretty handy right now.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.464
Tony:
<i> It's all yours.</i>
<i> Come by whenever.</i>

12:46.599 --> 12:48.066
Marcie:
<i> It'll just be for</i>
<i> a few days, I'm-</i>

12:48.068 --> 12:49.400
(phone dings)

12:49.402 --> 12:52.503
I'm actually going to
check out some spaces now.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.971
<i> You're the best.</i>

12:55.041 --> 12:56.607
Doug:
<i> Your honour,</i>

12:56.676 --> 12:58.342
<i> Ms. Mckay is a</i>
<i> respected elder</i>

12:58.378 --> 13:01.145
<i>Who I've asked to give critical</i>
<i> social and historical context</i>

13:01.214 --> 13:03.081
<i> To the grave harm</i>
<i> facing indigenous children</i>

13:03.083 --> 13:04.582
Taken from their
communities.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.717
Your honour,

13:05.852 --> 13:08.219
She has no pertinent educational
background or training.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.321
Whatever happened to
"lived experience"?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.490
This witness is revered
in her community.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.459
Ellery:
<i> We simply don't believe</i>
<i> ms. Mckay has enough</i>

13:14.594 --> 13:16.561
Relevant experience
to assist the court.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.563
Doug:
<i> She's a child advocate</i>
<i> and a clan mother.</i>

13:18.565 --> 13:20.030
Maybe that's what she
does in her spare time.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.532
Her spare time?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.701
Ellery:
<i> Well professionally, ms. Mckay</i>
<i> runs a small coffee shop.</i>

13:23.737 --> 13:24.936
Doug:
<i> Your honour, it is</i>
<i> very important</i>

13:25.071 --> 13:27.204
<i> That the court understand</i>
<i> ms. Mckay's role here.</i>

13:27.240 --> 13:28.873
<i> Her wisdom and authority</i>
<i> has been passed down</i>

13:28.909 --> 13:30.808
Through generations of
matriarchal lines.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.177
I'm afraid I have
to agree with-

13:32.312 --> 13:33.511
Colleen.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.848
Your honour.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.582
In many communities,
the law does not function

13:38.618 --> 13:40.251
Without clan mothers.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.186
It is people
like ms. Mckay

13:41.321 --> 13:42.520
Who'd be sitting
in your place.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.789
And that's perfectly
understandable, mr. Paul.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.391
However, I'm grasping
at a rationale

13:46.526 --> 13:48.459
As to why this
witness's testimony

13:48.461 --> 13:50.795
Is relevant to a
child abduction case.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.130
And I'm-I'm not seeing it.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.799
Please call your
next witness.

13:59.739 --> 14:03.341
Marcie:
<i> So it's a glass tower?</i>

14:03.410 --> 14:06.043
I love a sun-drenched space.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.213
Well it's certainly bright.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.682
I just, I think maybe
our clients might find

14:10.817 --> 14:13.084
A space like this a
little-little intimidating.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.853
Vivian:
<i> So cross towers</i>
<i> off the list?</i>

14:14.988 --> 14:16.688
Yeah, maybe something
a little more...

14:18.158 --> 14:19.123
Approachable.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.358
Got it.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.592
So...

14:22.829 --> 14:25.029
How are you feeling about
our little endeavour so far?

14:25.164 --> 14:26.064
Good!

14:26.199 --> 14:28.232
Uh, I'm just,
I'm really focused on,

14:28.301 --> 14:29.767
On building the
team right now.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.302
I heard about that.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.770
(scoffs) of course.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.240
Well, you know,
I hope that she considers.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.975
Ellery's smart.
She's sharp.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.310
No question.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.812
But maybe not quite
right for this venture.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.716
Oh, are you saying I
shouldn't hire her?

14:45.718 --> 14:46.717
Oh, I don't tell
you what to do.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.854
I mean, we established
that in our agreement.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.722
So what are we
talking about?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.124
Vivian:
<i> My preference,</i>

14:53.126 --> 14:54.459
That's all that it is,

14:54.461 --> 14:56.760
Is that you go in a
different direction.

14:56.796 --> 15:01.565
(ambient music)

15:01.635 --> 15:04.268
Martin tells me you're
a beast in the courtroom.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.870
Ellery:
<i> When did you</i>
<i> talk to my boss?</i>

15:06.005 --> 15:08.406
<i> You know he brags</i>
<i> about you, ellery.</i>

15:08.475 --> 15:09.474
<i> Unsolicited.</i>

15:09.476 --> 15:11.141
Mmhmm, I bet it
was unsolicited.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.443
Chozanne:
<i> In fact,</i>

15:12.578 --> 15:15.479
He told me he was speaking to
the justice minister about you.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.148
Okay mom,

15:17.283 --> 15:18.750
We don't have to have a
symposium on my work

15:18.885 --> 15:20.518
Every single time
we get together.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.086
What's wrong with me
wanting to help my daughter

15:22.221 --> 15:23.454
Along in her career?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.959
Marcie diggs
offered me a job.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.830
Dear god, ellery!

15:33.934 --> 15:34.966
<i> You're gonna throw your</i>
<i> entire career away</i>

15:35.035 --> 15:36.701
To go work for
some radical?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.168
I just want some
new challenges

15:38.204 --> 15:39.303
And she's not a radical.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.705
No?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.040
It's pretty clear
she hates cops.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.107
That's not true,

15:43.242 --> 15:44.976
And I wouldn't be
considering this if it was.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.111
Ellery, in a few years
you could be running

15:47.113 --> 15:49.046
Every prosecution
in the province.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.515
<i> You have the ear of</i>
<i> the justice minister.</i>

15:51.551 --> 15:53.784
You think he takes
calls from marcie diggs?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.155
This isn't what
we worked for.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.694
Must be nice to have such
strong opinions on the military

16:03.697 --> 16:04.762
When you've never
been in the field.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.531
Ah, louise doesn't sensor
herself about politics.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.933
<i> She doesn't mean</i>
<i> anything by it.</i>

16:08.935 --> 16:10.301
Wrong foot, that's all.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.269
Ian:
<i> You know what dad?</i>

16:11.404 --> 16:13.003
You love her and that's
good enough for me.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.872
Well thanks, buddy.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.540
Reggie:
<i> Wait, what-what does</i>
<i> that mean exactly?</i>

16:16.576 --> 16:18.208
Well just because
you love louise,

16:18.244 --> 16:19.677
It doesn't mean I have to.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.345
We don't need to get along.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.281
<i> I'll play nice on christmas</i>
<i> and thanksgiving, it's fine.</i>

16:24.283 --> 16:25.349
Look at you and mom.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.985
Reggie:
<i> You know, we need a re-do.</i>

16:27.120 --> 16:28.152
When everybody's rested.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.488
Dad, it's not about
getting a good night's sleep.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.222
Just let it be what it is.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.591
Just try again for me.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.094
Sure.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.595
Okay.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.364
<i> Let's do it all over again.</i>

16:40.433 --> 16:41.732
(door knocking)

16:42.602 --> 16:44.502
Oh, I hope I'm
not interrupting?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.570
Marcie, come in,
meet my son ian.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.905
Oh, I've heard a
lot about you.

16:47.941 --> 16:48.906
Me too.

16:48.942 --> 16:49.841
My dad's new boss.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.742
Ah, excuse me.

16:51.745 --> 16:52.810
<i> I'm a freelancer.</i>

16:52.945 --> 16:55.712
I'm an eminence grise
for hire if you will.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.515
He's basically invaluable.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.916
I don't doubt that.

16:58.918 --> 16:59.850
See you dad.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.685
I'll be in touch
about that re-do.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.360
So, what do your clients
want out of a class action?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.395
Money? Apology?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.331
I don't think they'll
turn down either.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.067
But the most important
thing is to end the practice

17:16.202 --> 17:17.568
Of birth alerts.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.006
Well, perhaps civil court
is not the best place

17:22.141 --> 17:24.909
To accomplish those goals.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.744
(ambient music)

17:26.813 --> 17:28.813
You really are invaluable.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.248
(ambient music)

17:30.383 --> 17:31.816
Avery v.O.:
<i> Now as far as</i>
<i> I'm concerned</i>

17:31.818 --> 17:33.684
<i> It's despicable when</i>
<i> people like ms. Nyiri</i>

17:33.686 --> 17:35.252
<i> Violate our trust.</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:38.089
<i> Anyone who'd harm a child</i>
<i> doesn't deserve my sympathy,</i>

17:38.158 --> 17:39.524
<i> Or anyone else's</i>
<i> for that matter.</i>

17:39.526 --> 17:40.892
Interviewer:
<i> And that was</i>
<i> avery mueller there</i>

17:41.027 --> 17:43.227
<i> Commenting on the case that's</i>
<i> not making its weight.</i>

17:47.233 --> 17:52.436
(crowd chattering quietly)

17:52.439 --> 17:54.738
Jen:
<i> My daughter's kid</i>
<i> saw that video.</i>

17:54.808 --> 17:56.707
She is furious with me!

17:56.776 --> 18:00.077
I promise you, I never
meant for that video

18:00.146 --> 18:01.279
To go public.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.580
But, marcie, why should
it have made a difference

18:02.715 --> 18:03.647
To the judge?

18:03.683 --> 18:04.781
'cause the defence
argued that-

18:04.818 --> 18:06.483
Gloria:
<i> So you violate</i>
<i> our privacy</i>

18:06.519 --> 18:08.052
And we don't even get
our day in court?

18:08.187 --> 18:10.120
Ivy:
<i> That isn't true,</i>
<i> is it marcie?</i>

18:10.156 --> 18:11.656
It can't be over already.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.990
It's not.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.861
Ladies, this case
is moving forward,

18:16.863 --> 18:17.928
Make no mistake.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.264
(scoffs) you said
it was thrown out.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.799
Of civil court, yes.

18:22.836 --> 18:25.069
But a civil suit is
not our only recourse.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.440
We're taking this to the
human rights commission.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.974
(scoffs)
(woman chuckling)

18:31.010 --> 18:33.944
(ambient music swells)

18:36.416 --> 18:38.015
Civil suit?

18:38.084 --> 18:39.750
It's not,

18:39.786 --> 18:40.818
Necessarily.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.587
But filing with the
hrc is more likely

18:43.623 --> 18:45.422
<i> To get us media attention,</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:48.259
Which ultimately is more
likely to provoke change

18:48.394 --> 18:49.460
In the government.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.195
Meaning ending birth alerts?

18:51.197 --> 18:52.496
Marcie:
<i> That's the hope.</i>

18:53.766 --> 18:56.100
Look, other provinces have
already banned the policy.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.301
Gloria:
<i> But no guarantee.</i>

18:57.436 --> 18:59.470
Marcie:
<i> Well there's never</i>
<i> any guarantees.</i>

18:59.539 --> 19:02.440
<i> Look, the only</i>
<i> thing we can do</i>

19:02.442 --> 19:03.975
Is give this
our best shot.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.242
Okay, what about money?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.510
Can we at least
get a settlement?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.912
Terri:
<i> It's not about the money.</i>

19:07.914 --> 19:09.746
I know that terri,
but it'd be nice.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.049
Marcie:
<i> A settlement is possible.</i>

19:12.085 --> 19:14.185
<i> It wouldn't be as</i>
<i> much as a civil suit,</i>

19:14.254 --> 19:16.154
But it would be something.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.188
(women grumbling)

19:17.257 --> 19:18.256
Something.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.390
The most important thing

19:19.459 --> 19:22.526
Is that this doesn't happen
to anybody else, right?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.662
<i> No more babies being stolen.</i>

19:25.932 --> 19:27.231
Gloria:
<i> Yeah.</i>

19:29.269 --> 19:30.567
Marcie, do you really
think this gives us

19:30.603 --> 19:31.869
A better shot at that?

19:34.174 --> 19:35.540
Yes.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.807
I really do.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.275
Then that's what
we should do.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.878
We have to stop this.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.414
Yeah, you're right.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.482
Gloria:
<i> Absolutely.</i>

19:44.484 --> 19:45.650
Yeah.

19:45.652 --> 19:49.220
(ambient music)

19:49.355 --> 19:50.621
Vivian:
<i> Good, here you are!</i>

19:51.624 --> 19:52.623
You said this place
was close, right?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.824
<i> 'cause I may need to run.</i>

19:53.959 --> 19:55.059
Right this way.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.093
What do you-

19:56.162 --> 19:57.161
What do you mean?

19:57.163 --> 19:59.296
I have a ton of space.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.731
We could be neighbours.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.300
You wanna move my new
firm to your offices?

20:03.336 --> 20:04.501
<i> I-</i>

20:04.537 --> 20:07.004
(scoffs) no.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.305
<i> No. (chuckles)</i>

20:08.341 --> 20:10.708
You know, I'm trying real hard
not to take offence right now.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.642
(phone ringing)

20:11.711 --> 20:13.176
It's really nice
of you but, uh-

20:14.547 --> 20:16.513
This is is hrc,
I gotta take this.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.382
<i> Marcie diggs.</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:22.185
<i> A study?</i>

20:22.222 --> 20:24.555
(tense music)

20:24.557 --> 20:25.790
Great, thanks.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.726
<i> Listen viv,</i>

20:28.795 --> 20:31.429
<i>Don't think I'm not grateful for</i>
<i> everything that you're doing,</i>

20:31.431 --> 20:34.732
I just, this is
more your space,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.199
Not mine.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.469
<i> I really have to</i>
<i> talk to my clients.</i>

20:39.438 --> 20:42.339
(ambient music)

20:46.112 --> 20:47.344
Look, I just need a moment.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.347
I'm just here to apologize.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.551
Well this should be good.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.953
So speak.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.025
I, um, I might have
been too aggressive

21:01.094 --> 21:03.026
When I was
prosecuting your case.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.162
And this just
occurred to you now?

21:05.231 --> 21:07.364
Avery:
<i> Sometimes my colleagues,</i>

21:07.433 --> 21:09.032
Myself included,

21:09.068 --> 21:10.835
Confuse putting
people behind bars

21:10.970 --> 21:13.270
With the protection
of the public.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.404
Carmen, I didn't
stop to think that-

21:14.440 --> 21:16.406
Carmen:
<i> That I could actually</i>
<i> be innocent?</i>

21:17.644 --> 21:19.043
Carmen, it wasn't personal.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.245
Not for you.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.649
I'm the one who's not
allowed to teach anymore.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.451
<i> Who's constantly</i>
<i> whispered about</i>

21:27.487 --> 21:30.788
<i> Every time I go shopping,</i>
<i> or to the bank.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:33.924
<i> My husband moved out with</i>
<i> my kids for over a year</i>

21:33.993 --> 21:37.594
Because it took that long
for him to trust me again.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.597
(tense music)

21:40.633 --> 21:41.932
Carmen, I'm sorry.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.801
I-I-I don't know
what to say.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.037
What are you looking for?

21:46.172 --> 21:47.705
Absolution?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.540
<i> You ruined my life</i>
<i> and now you want me</i>

21:49.609 --> 21:51.275
<i> To tell you it's okay?</i>

21:51.277 --> 21:54.745
(tense music)

21:54.781 --> 21:56.080
Well, it's not okay.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.886
Just go!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.157
Ellery:
<i> You were encouraged</i>
<i> to submit a safety plan</i>

22:07.159 --> 22:08.693
And you didn't, correct?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.529
I was told to and
I gave them one.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.230
Ellery:
<i> So how come out</i>
<i> of all the people</i>

22:13.299 --> 22:15.098
You might have chosen to
take care of your baby

22:15.134 --> 22:17.201
Did you propose
ronnie maloney?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.203
She's my auntie.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.705
<i> She's been good to</i>
<i> me my whole life.</i>

22:21.708 --> 22:23.441
Ellery:
<i> You knew she had a</i>
<i> criminal record.</i>

22:24.510 --> 22:25.843
That was a long time ago

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
But she's not a criminal.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.347
She smashed a bottle
in her neighbour's face.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.849
<i> She assaulted a</i>
<i> police officer.</i>

22:31.851 --> 22:34.085
<i> That doesn't make her a</i>
<i> criminal in your eyes?</i>

22:35.188 --> 22:37.121
Auntie's always done
her best by me.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.025
Yeah, I believe you
think that ivy.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.327
I really do.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.466
But, isn't it true that you
ended up in foster care

22:48.468 --> 22:50.735
Because your aunt decided
to remain in a relationship

22:50.870 --> 22:53.404
With a violent,
abusive man

22:53.473 --> 22:54.772
<i> Over parenting you?</i>

22:56.008 --> 22:58.075
<i> Ivy, she had the opportunity</i>
<i> to put you first,</i>

22:58.210 --> 22:59.410
<i> But she didn't,</i>

22:59.545 --> 23:01.345
<i> And now here you are,</i>
<i> once again,</i>

23:01.347 --> 23:03.313
And you're paying the cost
of your aunt's bad choices.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.815
(crying) that's not true.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.851
<i> Only this time ivy,</i>
<i> it's not just you,</i>
<i> this time it's your son.</i>

23:06.853 --> 23:07.752
Doug:
<i> Your honour!</i>

23:07.887 --> 23:08.819
Leave her alone,
you bitch!

23:08.855 --> 23:10.320
Colleen:
<i> That's enough.</i>

23:10.390 --> 23:12.590
<i> Mr. Paul, keep your</i>
<i> client in check.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:15.092
<i> There's nothing wrong with</i>
<i> ms. Lopez' questions.</i>

23:17.029 --> 23:19.630
(ivy sniffling)

23:20.933 --> 23:23.033
Colleen:
<i> As the crown is</i>
<i> finished with the witness-</i>

23:23.035 --> 23:23.967
Actually, your honour,
I have-

23:24.036 --> 23:26.771
As the crown is finished
with the witness,

23:26.906 --> 23:29.006
We will take a
fifteen minute recess.

23:29.075 --> 23:36.847
(solemn music)

23:37.750 --> 23:39.383
No one up there
wants the truth!

23:39.452 --> 23:41.652
That lawyer up there is
talking like she knows my life.

23:41.787 --> 23:42.987
She doesn't know me.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.721
You gotta keep your cool.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.657
Everyone up there
sounding like indian agents.

23:47.726 --> 23:48.826
<i> What?</i>

23:48.895 --> 23:51.194
You know child services is
doing the exact same thing

23:51.230 --> 23:52.796
As residential schools.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.998
<i> Ripping children</i>
<i> from their families.</i>

23:55.034 --> 23:56.600
Same thing,
different name.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.436
A lot of people are
trying to change this,

23:58.571 --> 24:00.804
Advocates working to fund
community-based child services.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.339
Oh, community based?

24:02.408 --> 24:03.474
What about those of
us who don't know

24:03.609 --> 24:05.208
Who our community is?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.177
You're right, ronnie.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.680
I-I can't even begin to
imagine what that's like.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.215
Ronnie:
<i> If we don't get</i>
<i> that baby back,</i>

24:11.284 --> 24:15.018
He'll be the fifth generation
to be raised in the system.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.086
It'll wreck ivy.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.755
It'll ruin them both,
I've seen it.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.691
We're working really hard
so that doesn't happen.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.559
(solemn music)

24:22.628 --> 24:24.027
I want to go on the stand.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.665
I don't think
that's a good idea.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.700
Everyone up there
talking about the system's

24:29.835 --> 24:31.168
A part of the system.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.504
<i> Ivy's the only one</i>
<i> who's testified</i>

24:33.639 --> 24:35.039
With any actual
experience of it,

24:35.174 --> 24:36.773
And they steamrolled her!

24:36.909 --> 24:37.841
I'm advising you,

24:37.844 --> 24:39.376
After your last
outburst in the court,

24:39.512 --> 24:41.945
This isn't the best way
for the truth to come out.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.915
But it'll be my truth.

24:44.984 --> 24:49.853
(solemn music)

24:52.791 --> 24:55.859
They're not certified
for infant care.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.394
Well you can
fast track that.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.064
Oh, come on.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.066
This is a great family
for ivy's baby.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.336
They're only a few blocks
away from ivy's foster home.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.937
She can actually
visit her son.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.876
Iris, do you have any idea
how slammed this office is?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.411
The baby is already in
an appropriate home.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.946
But you said if I
found a family-

25:15.982 --> 25:17.214
We don't have
the resources

25:17.349 --> 25:19.549
To play musical
foster homes here.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.019
(tense music)

25:22.021 --> 25:23.854
You were brushing me off.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.423
<i> You never had any intention</i>
<i> of moving the baby.</i>

25:26.492 --> 25:27.624
(phone ringing)

25:28.694 --> 25:30.460
Cleo:
<i> I have to take this. Sorry.</i>

25:30.496 --> 25:31.595
(phone ringing)

25:32.698 --> 25:33.964
Cleo:
<i> Cleo thom speaking.</i>

25:36.369 --> 25:42.172
So, the hrc has
reviewed our submission.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.277
<i> And they have come</i>
<i> back with an offer.</i>

25:48.648 --> 25:52.048
<i> They've offered to</i>
<i> conduct a study</i>

25:52.050 --> 25:54.051
On birth alerts.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.986
And they've asked if
you all would be willing

25:56.022 --> 25:57.421
To participate.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.189
A study?

25:59.324 --> 26:01.925
We don't know what the results
of the study could be,

26:01.994 --> 26:04.628
It-it could lead
to lasting change.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.463
It's just the
same run around.

26:06.599 --> 26:07.431
Ivy:
<i> We don't want</i>
<i> them to study it.</i>

26:07.500 --> 26:08.465
<i> I want them to stop it.</i>

26:08.501 --> 26:10.067
You said this was
our best shot.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.135
Just, there's more that
we can do if we just-

26:12.204 --> 26:13.604
Marcie, we're tired.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.007
Ivy, it's not over.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.208
It is for me.

26:18.244 --> 26:25.181
(solemn music)

26:25.217 --> 26:26.717
Louise:
<i> Reggie, you said it yourself,</i>

26:26.719 --> 26:27.717
Dinner was bad.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.286
Ian and I just
didn't click.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.022
Well you didn't let
yourselves click.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.624
I mean, you kinda
went after him.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.027
(sighs) how many times
do I have to apologize?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.829
<i> I meant no offence to ian.</i>

26:38.964 --> 26:40.664
I just get fired up
when it's something

26:40.799 --> 26:41.698
I feel strongly about.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.766
Oh I know.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.002
Why do you think I threw
away my cargo shorts?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.070
(louise laughs)

26:46.072 --> 26:47.905
<i> So listen,</i>
<i> I've proposed a do-over.</i>

26:48.040 --> 26:49.306
Ian's totally into it.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.641
I find that hard
to believe.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.743
Reggie:
<i> Just give him a shot.</i>

26:52.878 --> 26:55.712
I mean, you gave me a
shot and look at us now.

26:57.717 --> 26:58.982
Okay.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.383
Bring on round two.

27:01.220 --> 27:07.157
(ambient music)

27:07.226 --> 27:09.793
♪

27:09.928 --> 27:13.397
Someone doesn't look
up for office shopping?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.864
It's just one
of those days.

27:17.603 --> 27:20.370
I don't know, I just keep
hitting these roadblocks.

27:21.574 --> 27:22.739
Class action
got tossed out,

27:22.875 --> 27:25.241
And then hrc
turned us down.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.745
And now ivy's baby couldn't
be further from her.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.748
I don't know, I-

27:32.952 --> 27:35.419
Every time I make a move
I just keep getting zapped.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.754
Sounds like you
need a new move.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.956
I think I'm out of moves.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.792
Listen, you knew
this was a big case.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.361
All of these women,
all of their stories,

27:44.496 --> 27:47.898
Just take the roadblocks
one at a time.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.499
One at a time.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.068
Uh huh.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.972
Viv, I'm sorry I gotta go.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.508
Not just yet.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.943
I have one more place
I want to show you.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.412
What about this place?

28:03.315 --> 28:08.719
(ambient music)

28:08.788 --> 28:10.253
That's halifax legal aid.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.254
Not anymore.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.756
I just bought the building.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.458
<i> So, it can be whatever</i>
<i> I want it to be.</i>

28:15.494 --> 28:19.596
Including marcie diggs
& associates.

28:19.665 --> 28:20.930
Marcie:
<i> Wow.</i>

28:21.467 --> 28:22.599
<i> Love it.</i>

28:24.970 --> 28:26.336
You know viv,
I really do have to go.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.237
You go.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.304
Just know that's your spot.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.074
I'm just gonna viva it up.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.484
Marcie:
<i> Ivy.</i>

28:40.553 --> 28:42.119
I have a new strategy
for the case.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.319
Not interested.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.756
<i> Ivy, just hear me out, okay?</i>

28:47.626 --> 28:50.527
I think I found something
that could really work.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.262
Don't you get it?

28:52.298 --> 28:54.965
I don't care about the case,
this is about my son.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.900
And he's gone and I don't know
if I'll ever get him back.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.434
And nothing that you've
done has made a difference!

28:58.471 --> 28:59.903
So just leave me alone.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.706
(tense music swells)

29:09.882 --> 29:11.981
Ona:
<i> Danish? Wow.</i>

29:12.017 --> 29:13.483
<i> How did I get so lucky?</i>

29:14.854 --> 29:16.319
You know I would
never bother you at home

29:16.355 --> 29:18.655
If it wasn't
really important.

29:19.692 --> 29:20.857
Uh huh.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.160
Get folding then and
tell me what it's about.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.998
Ivy maloney.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.332
Ona:
<i> Mmmhmm.</i>

29:30.136 --> 29:31.501
Iris:
<i> She had her baby.</i>

29:31.570 --> 29:32.869
I heard.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.438
<i> Doesn't explain why you're</i>
<i> plying me with pastry.</i>

29:34.440 --> 29:36.740
Iris:
<i> Well and did you hear that</i>
<i> they sent him to a foster home</i>

29:36.742 --> 29:38.374
Three hours away?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.177
Good foster parents
are like hen's teeth,

29:40.246 --> 29:41.211
You know that.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.046
Yeah, but I found
really good ones.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.881
<i> Right here in halifax.</i>

29:44.917 --> 29:47.484
I just need to get them
certified for infant-care.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.252
So why are you
on my doorstep

29:49.288 --> 29:51.021
Instead of going through
the proper channels?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.060
You got turned down?

29:57.930 --> 29:59.496
You're here to pull strings?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.767
Iris:
<i> The system put that</i>
<i> girl through the wringer</i>

30:04.804 --> 30:06.269
<i> And now she can't even</i>
<i> see her own child.</i>

30:06.338 --> 30:08.238
Come on, ona.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.639
<i> You know this</i>
<i> isn't right.</i>

30:16.148 --> 30:18.582
You know she almost
lost her mind?

30:18.717 --> 30:20.250
"marcie diggs
is a radical".

30:21.387 --> 30:23.053
All I said was that I
was considering it.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.588
Your mom's just
looking out for you.

30:24.657 --> 30:25.822
Ellery:
<i> No.</i>

30:26.525 --> 30:27.724
She's micromanaging me

30:27.860 --> 30:30.427
And it's way past time
I put a stop to it.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.029
You really think
going to work for marcie

30:32.031 --> 30:33.597
Is the best way
to do that?

30:33.732 --> 30:35.999
<i> This isn't me rebelling</i>
<i> against my mother,</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:37.300
I'm not fourteen.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.536
I just want change.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.373
You can go anywhere.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.807
Why marcie?

30:46.478 --> 30:48.611
You don't want me
to do this either?

30:48.647 --> 30:49.746
You know how this
is the kitchen

30:49.815 --> 30:51.114
And I eat in here?

30:52.151 --> 30:53.950
Well, down the hall's
the bathroom and-

30:53.986 --> 30:56.420
<i> In this metaphor am I</i>
<i> the sink or the toilet?</i>

30:58.691 --> 30:59.956
You know what I'm saying.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.992
I do, and I don't like it.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.295
<i> You know, this decision it's</i>
<i> not actually about you, viv.</i>

31:05.331 --> 31:06.796
Crazy concept, I know.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.174
I'm late, I've gotta go.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.178
(ambient music)

31:22.214 --> 31:23.947
Doug:
<i> Colleen is</i>
<i> kicking my ass.</i>

31:24.082 --> 31:25.215
Every objection "overruled".

31:25.217 --> 31:26.450
And this ellery person?

31:26.585 --> 31:27.917
Oh, she's good,
isn't she?

31:27.919 --> 31:29.185
Not the word I
was thinking of.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.787
Be nice.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.489
Iris:
(knocking)<i> knock, knock.</i>

31:33.926 --> 31:35.659
We have some good news.

31:35.728 --> 31:38.194
You said your team
would get my baby closer

31:38.230 --> 31:39.496
And you did.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.799
I'm sorry I talked to
you like that marcie.

31:42.835 --> 31:44.267
I shouldn't have
doubted you.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.037
I'm so happy.

31:47.172 --> 31:49.039
(ambient music)

31:49.041 --> 31:50.474
Is this all for our case?

31:50.609 --> 31:51.975
Marcie:
<i> It is, yes.</i>

31:52.110 --> 31:55.545
So, you gonna tell me all about
your exciting new plan or what?

31:55.680 --> 31:56.546
Absolutely.

31:56.681 --> 31:57.680
You good here?

31:57.716 --> 31:59.616
Yeah, I'm just working
on my questions for ronnie.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.817
All right.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.689
You wanted to see me?

32:06.525 --> 32:07.857
Martin:
<i> Close the door.</i>

32:11.897 --> 32:13.229
<i> Take a seat.</i>

32:18.804 --> 32:19.869
You want to explain to me

32:19.905 --> 32:22.506
Why I just got a call from
carmen nyiri's lawyer?

32:23.776 --> 32:24.841
I'm not following.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.909
Martin:
<i> Thanks to your</i>
<i> visit to ms. Nyiri,</i>

32:26.946 --> 32:28.712
And your little apology,

32:28.781 --> 32:31.448
You and our office
are now being sued

32:31.450 --> 32:32.915
For malicious prosecution.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.787
(sighs) frankly, she
deserved an apology.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.254
Martin:
<i> You're a prosecutor.</i>

32:38.290 --> 32:40.056
It's not your damn
business to decide

32:40.125 --> 32:41.725
What people deserve.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.527
You leave that up to the
judges and the juries.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.029
I went after that woman.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.398
And I tore her life apart.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.599
For what?

32:49.601 --> 32:51.067
This is what
we're gonna do.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.504
I'm gonna call a
press conference.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.039
<i> You're gonna set the</i>
<i> record straight.</i>

32:56.174 --> 32:58.542
<i> You're gonna deny making any</i>
<i> comments about the nyiri case,</i>

32:58.677 --> 32:59.942
<i> Deny making an apology,</i>

32:59.979 --> 33:04.214
And maybe just maybe
this thing will go away.

33:04.349 --> 33:05.549
I'm not doing that sir, no.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.017
Martin:
<i> Well isn't that funny?</i>

33:07.152 --> 33:09.553
<i> I don't remember</i>
<i> asking you a question.</i>

33:10.990 --> 33:12.222
I'm not going to lie.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.290
Martin:

I was trying to
protect him.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.013
Keep him from going through
what all of us went through.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.615
Doug:

34:12.750 --> 34:14.684
Ronnie:

34:20.359 --> 34:24.361
You know, me and my
big sister kara,

34:24.363 --> 34:27.364
We grew up in a little
house out in spryfield.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.766
<i> That was till we</i>
<i> were seven, eight,</i>

34:29.901 --> 34:32.636
<i> And then mom died</i>

And me and kara,
we didn't have people.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.241
<i> Didn't have nowhere to go.</i>

34:38.243 --> 34:40.176
But your mother was
from millbrook.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.311
Was that an option?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.980
We didn't know anything
about millbrook.

34:44.049 --> 34:46.649
I mean, mom got scooped
when she was little

34:46.718 --> 34:48.518
<i> Just like a</i>
<i> bunch of others.</i>

34:48.520 --> 34:52.155
<i> She never talked about</i>

34:56.394 --> 34:58.195

How do you think it was?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.470
I was in six different
foster homes

35:06.605 --> 35:08.304
By the time I was fifteen.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.073
<i> Some of them were</i>
<i> nice enough</i>

35:10.075 --> 35:13.209
<i> And some of them</i>
<i> were not so nice.</i>

35:13.278 --> 35:14.744
Do I gotta get
into all that?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.212
Doug:
<i> Were you and your</i>
<i> sister placed</i>

35:16.248 --> 35:17.347
With indigenous
foster parents?

35:17.416 --> 35:20.083
Is that a joke? No.

35:20.085 --> 35:23.920
<i> My sister was sent to a</i>
<i> different home than me.</i>

35:23.922 --> 35:26.422
She ended up way out
in another town.

35:27.493 --> 35:30.293
By the time I was old
enough to find her,

35:30.295 --> 35:31.828
She was dead.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.030
<i> No one even told me.</i>

35:34.099 --> 35:35.431
Doug:
<i> I'm so sorry</i>
<i> to hear that.</i>

35:37.136 --> 35:39.736
So your grandmother went
to residential school,

35:39.805 --> 35:40.871
<i> Your mother grows</i>
<i> up in care,</i>

35:41.006 --> 35:42.639
<i> You and your sister</i>
<i> grow up in care.</i>

35:43.708 --> 35:44.908
What kind of relationship
do you have

35:44.910 --> 35:46.476
With your community?

35:46.611 --> 35:48.845
My mom tried to
look for relatives,

35:48.914 --> 35:50.713
She found a few
cousins once.

35:51.783 --> 35:55.919
But other than that,
we didn't know much.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.720
She died before
she could go back.

35:57.756 --> 35:58.855
Have you been
able to reconnect

35:58.924 --> 36:00.389
With your community?

36:00.425 --> 36:01.925
Ronnie:
<i> I've been back.</i>

36:01.927 --> 36:04.194
But I'm still a stranger.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.530
No one remembers
me or my mom.

36:07.899 --> 36:12.202
<i> It's a weird feeling 'cause</i>
<i> I know that's my home</i>

36:12.271 --> 36:17.040
But it's like everything is
covered in plastic, you know?

36:18.477 --> 36:19.943
And that's why you didn't
want your grand-nephew

36:20.012 --> 36:21.544
Growing up in care?

36:21.580 --> 36:24.080
To keep him from experiencing
that same feeling

36:24.149 --> 36:25.815
Of dislocation
you've described?

36:25.817 --> 36:27.750
Ronnie:
<i> I don't trust the system</i>

36:27.819 --> 36:29.653
To keep us safe.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.121
<i> We didn't get a chance</i>
<i> to know who we are,</i>

36:32.157 --> 36:34.591
To know where we came from,
you get me?

36:36.561 --> 36:38.628
<i> Ivy didn't want that</i>
<i> for her little boy.</i>

36:40.165 --> 36:41.631
I didn't either.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.899
He needs to have people.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.837
Thank you, ronnie.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.905
Your honour, I have
no further questions

36:48.974 --> 36:50.273
For my witness.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.375
Your witness, ms. Lopez.

37:01.519 --> 37:02.585
Can you explain
to the court

37:02.654 --> 37:04.587
Why your niece, ivy,
ended up in care?

37:06.358 --> 37:08.658
I had a drug addiction

37:08.694 --> 37:10.927
That I let get
the better of me.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.262
But that was a
long time ago.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.297
When you say "get
the better of me"

37:14.433 --> 37:16.799
You mean to say that you
left your niece in a diner

37:16.835 --> 37:18.735
For two hours while you were
shooting up in an alley?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.002
Ronnie:
<i> You don't know what</i>
<i> you're talking about.</i>

37:20.038 --> 37:21.137
Objection, your honour.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.839
Colleen:
<i> Ms. Lopez, I'm gonna</i>

37:22.908 --> 37:25.275
Encourage you to rethink
your line of questioning.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.611
<i> The court is very familiar</i>
<i> with the challenges</i>

37:27.746 --> 37:29.412
<i> Indigenous people</i>
<i> face as a result of</i>

37:29.414 --> 37:31.147
<i> Intergenerational trauma</i>

37:31.283 --> 37:33.349
<i> And the racism ingrained</i>
<i> in our society</i>

37:33.385 --> 37:34.684
And is sympathetic.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.955
You mentioned you
wanted your grand-nephew

37:39.090 --> 37:41.357
To grow up knowing
where he comes from.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.225
Is that where you
were taking him

37:42.360 --> 37:44.160
On the night in question?

37:44.162 --> 37:45.762
No, I wasn't going to mill-

37:45.897 --> 37:47.364
Ellery:
<i> Isn't it true</i>
<i> that millbrook</i>

37:47.366 --> 37:50.099
<i> Was 100 kilometres in</i>
<i> the other direction?</i>

37:50.168 --> 37:51.901
I was just trying
to protect him.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.336
<i> I didn't have a plan-</i>

37:53.338 --> 37:55.504
Ellery:
<i> I need to understand this.</i>

37:55.540 --> 37:57.707
You stole a newborn
from the hospital

37:57.709 --> 37:59.142
<i> With no car seat,</i>

37:59.211 --> 38:01.210
<i> No formula, no plan.</i>

38:01.246 --> 38:02.845
Isn't this kind of
poor decision-making

38:02.881 --> 38:05.448
The reason why you lost
custody of your niece?

38:05.583 --> 38:06.783
<i> Isn't this kind of</i>
<i> poor judgement</i>

38:06.918 --> 38:08.384
<i> That you've displayed</i>
<i> over and over again</i>

38:08.520 --> 38:10.186
<i> The sole reason you</i>
<i> were deemed unfit</i>

38:10.222 --> 38:12.688
<i> To be accepted as the</i>
<i>guardian for your grand-nephew?</i>

38:14.592 --> 38:15.858
Lady, you're right,

38:17.262 --> 38:18.527
I didn't have a plan.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.865
The only thing that was
going through my mind

38:22.901 --> 38:26.902
When I saw that awesome
little boy in my niece's arms

38:27.939 --> 38:29.205
Was "not him".

38:30.442 --> 38:32.408
They don't get to have him.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.944
Not him.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.680
(tense dramatic music)

38:36.815 --> 38:38.748
No, I don't care if the minister
needs it this afternoon.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.082
(knocking)

38:40.786 --> 38:42.251
No. Listen, I gotta go.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.824
Oh, I'm sure you
remember my clients

38:47.893 --> 38:49.358
And their
class action suit?

38:50.361 --> 38:52.228
I remember the
judge threw it out.

38:52.264 --> 38:53.630
Yeah, see,

38:53.765 --> 38:56.166
They actually decided that
they wanted to file suit

38:56.301 --> 38:58.835
Against the
government individually.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.338
Individually?
-<i> Mmhmm.</i>

39:02.541 --> 39:04.174
All these women.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.776
<i> And next week it'll</i>
<i> be double that.</i>

39:06.778 --> 39:08.711
<i> And, that's just the start.</i>

39:08.780 --> 39:11.714
<i> I mean, I figure once the</i>
<i> media gets wind of this</i>

39:11.783 --> 39:14.184
There'll be quite a few
more women wanting to sue.

39:15.587 --> 39:19.756
If the ladies wouldn't mind
stepping out into the hallway,

39:19.825 --> 39:22.058
Perhaps you and I can
come to some agreement.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.726
Hm.

39:23.795 --> 39:28.064
(tense dramatic music)

39:28.133 --> 39:29.399
Marcie:
<i> The ladies stay.</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:31.601
(tense dramatic music)

39:35.073 --> 39:37.674
Ms. Maloney, I believe
<i> you acted impulsively,</i>

39:37.676 --> 39:39.609
<i> And, yes, unwisely</i>

39:39.678 --> 39:41.677
When you left town with
your great-nephew.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.281
But I'm troubled to
learn of the government's

39:45.350 --> 39:48.451
Callous disregard for your
niece's rights as a mother.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.319
<i> And even more troubled</i>
<i> at why widespread</i>

39:50.389 --> 39:51.821
<i> This disregard</i>
<i> appears to be.</i>

39:51.890 --> 39:53.022
Particularly,
it must be said,

39:53.024 --> 39:54.924
When it comes to
indigenous women.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.761
<i> The defendant acted at</i>
<i> the request of the mother,</i>

39:57.896 --> 40:00.096
And had good cause to
fear the harm her nephew

40:00.231 --> 40:02.899
Would suffer in the
foster care system.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.834
<i> Therefore, I find</i>
<i> ronnie maloney not guilty</i>

40:04.903 --> 40:06.636
On the charge
of kidnapping.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.370
Sheriff:
<i> Court is adjourned.</i>

40:08.407 --> 40:10.673
(solemn ambient music)

40:10.742 --> 40:12.041
Hey ronnie, we won!

40:13.245 --> 40:14.543
You should be smiling.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.580
What's there to smile about?

40:17.582 --> 40:20.917
I should never have been
arrested in the first place.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.052
And nicholas is
still in care.

40:23.187 --> 40:27.256
(solemn ambient music)

40:27.292 --> 40:28.891
(muffled chattering)

40:28.927 --> 40:30.860
I'm sorry I'm late.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.394
I didn't mean to
leave you two alone.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.230
It's okay,
we haven't ordered yet.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.798
I mean, you can't
be serious.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.734
<i> These missions are</i>
<i> totally outdated.</i>

40:37.736 --> 40:39.535
Try telling that to the
people we're helping.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.470
Hey guys,
let's just take a breath.

40:40.605 --> 40:41.938
No dad, it's fine.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.706
There are villages
across the globe

40:43.742 --> 40:45.141
That wouldn't have
clean drinking water

40:45.276 --> 40:46.409
Without peacekeepers.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.344
Do you know how many
communities here in canada

40:48.413 --> 40:49.545
Don't have clean water?

40:49.614 --> 40:51.547
Okay, well it's not
an either/or situation.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.849
Everyone should have
clean drinking water.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.383
We should order.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.020
The salmon
looks good.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.421
Oh, it's farmed.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.424
So?

41:01.426 --> 41:02.692
So are chickens.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.727

<i> How threatening to choke the</i>

41:45.837 --> 41:48.171
Actually got the
system to work.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.238
That money is
gonna be put away

41:49.307 --> 41:50.806
For this one's education.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.775
Doug:
<i> I'm just glad that social</i>
<i> services listened to reason</i>

41:52.811 --> 41:54.878

once ronnie was acquitted.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.213
Ting, tang,
they better had.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.481
Otherwise you guys and me,
