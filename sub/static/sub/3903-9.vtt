00:26.276 --> 00:27.776
WMD. Got that WMD here.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.777
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

00:29.877 --> 00:33.077
-This shit right here?
-The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

00:33.177 --> 00:36.778
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.678
So this the hi-test?

00:38.978 --> 00:40.678
Same shit, new name.

00:41.279 --> 00:42.679
You be all right.

00:58.682 --> 01:00.382
Okay, get dressed.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.082
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

01:03.182 --> 01:05.283
And don't forget that book bag neither.

01:08.684 --> 01:10.784
You got your chrome, young one?

01:15.085 --> 01:16.585
I'll take mine.

01:21.086 --> 01:23.086
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

01:23.186 --> 01:24.286
Let's go.

01:32.488 --> 01:34.488
They coming up the alley!

01:34.889 --> 01:36.489
They coming back!

01:38.790 --> 01:41.190
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

01:42.390 --> 01:43.691
Slide up.

01:53.592 --> 01:55.892
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

01:55.992 --> 01:58.093
-You hear me, boy?
-Okay, Mama.

02:01.194 --> 02:02.193
Come on!

02:02.594 --> 02:03.593
Fuck!

02:07.094 --> 02:08.195
Shit!

02:10.395 --> 02:12.996
-Why you running?
-What the fuck?

02:16.297 --> 02:17.196
Oh, shit!

02:19.397 --> 02:20.697
Hit that nigger cold.

02:21.497 --> 02:22.698
Bitches!

02:35.300 --> 02:36.900
Why you hiding?

02:57.904 --> 02:59.004
Drama done with, boy.

02:59.104 --> 03:01.405
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

03:07.806 --> 03:09.406
Get in, damn it!

03:15.407 --> 03:18.907
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

03:19.108 --> 03:21.908
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

03:24.009 --> 03:26.509
I told you, you gotta get ready....

03:40.912 --> 03:42.912
No!

05:28.832 --> 05:30.232
They're changing up?

05:30.332 --> 05:33.733
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

05:33.932 --> 05:36.233
-That shipment is tomorrow.
-Got it.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.333
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.634
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.434
Now listen.

05:44.634 --> 05:46.335
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?

05:46.435 --> 05:51.036
-You got them Davinas or what?
-I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.836
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

05:53.936 --> 05:56.137
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

05:56.237 --> 05:58.037
since we followed that truck off the docks.

05:58.137 --> 06:01.238
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

06:01.338 --> 06:04.838
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.

06:06.938 --> 06:09.539
-We tipped our hand somewhere.
-That second can, maybe.

06:09.738 --> 06:13.139
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.040
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

06:16.141 --> 06:18.741
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

06:19.941 --> 06:22.741
-What?
-They probably changed that up, too.

06:24.441 --> 06:26.442
If they think we're onto them...

06:26.542 --> 06:28.843
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

06:28.943 --> 06:31.443
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

06:31.543 --> 06:34.044
-just to see if we pull them up.
-Which we did.

06:34.243 --> 06:35.843
Which I did.

06:36.644 --> 06:39.344
No, they're not on us completely.

06:39.744 --> 06:42.945
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

06:43.145 --> 06:47.445
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

06:47.546 --> 06:49.546
waiting us out.

06:49.646 --> 06:52.547
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

06:57.848 --> 06:59.348
Don't waste film.

06:59.448 --> 07:03.648
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.749
Anything?

07:06.949 --> 07:10.049
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

07:24.852 --> 07:26.153
Little late.

07:26.253 --> 07:28.253
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

07:28.353 --> 07:30.654
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.954
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.255
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.055
D.C.? What for?

07:37.155 --> 07:40.256
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

07:40.356 --> 07:43.256
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

07:43.356 --> 07:45.056
So what do we got?

07:45.357 --> 07:47.057
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

07:47.157 --> 07:50.157
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

07:50.358 --> 07:52.557
-Dead?
-Pronounced at University.

07:53.258 --> 07:54.958
-Witnesses?
-No one offering a name...

07:55.058 --> 07:57.959
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

07:58.059 --> 08:00.759
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

08:00.859 --> 08:03.360
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

08:03.460 --> 08:06.160
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.961
Fucking pointless.

08:08.361 --> 08:10.761
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

08:10.861 --> 08:14.762
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

08:15.261 --> 08:19.162
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

08:19.663 --> 08:21.963
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

08:22.363 --> 08:24.564
You'll feel better when you do.

08:26.264 --> 08:29.365
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

08:29.765 --> 08:32.465
-You said that--
-I said change the name of our product.

08:32.565 --> 08:35.065
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.866
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

08:37.966 --> 08:40.265
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

08:40.366 --> 08:43.167
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.568
Who shot the young one?

08:46.667 --> 08:48.668
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

08:48.768 --> 08:50.969
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean--

08:51.069 --> 08:54.869
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.369
They got to.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.370
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.470
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

09:01.570 --> 09:04.471
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

09:05.772 --> 09:07.272
I know, String.

09:08.772 --> 09:10.272
I'm sorry, man.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.674
Let me tell you something, man.

09:20.473 --> 09:24.174
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

09:24.274 --> 09:25.474
the corner you hold.

09:25.574 --> 09:27.675
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

09:28.075 --> 09:32.376
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

09:33.477 --> 09:35.576
Give and take on both sides.

09:35.977 --> 09:37.577
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

09:40.277 --> 09:43.378
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

09:43.478 --> 09:45.178
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

09:45.278 --> 09:47.078
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

09:47.179 --> 09:51.080
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.780
All right.

10:03.782 --> 10:05.182
Coming up.

10:36.688 --> 10:38.888
I got people waiting on a package from me...

10:38.988 --> 10:41.689
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police....

10:41.789 --> 10:44.990
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

10:47.390 --> 10:50.490
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

10:51.491 --> 10:52.991
But, Niko...

10:53.091 --> 10:56.991
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.192
Why not?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.892
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.093
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

11:08.693 --> 11:12.094
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

11:17.095 --> 11:18.595
Call that number.

11:18.996 --> 11:21.396
-Talk to him.
-Mike?

11:23.496 --> 11:24.996
This White Mike?

11:25.097 --> 11:27.397
-You know him?
-From Curtis Bay.

11:29.198 --> 11:31.498
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

11:31.598 --> 11:35.599
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

11:37.199 --> 11:39.799
Now, for the rest of our business....

11:41.600 --> 11:45.201
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.600
Take them to Newkirk Street.

11:48.001 --> 11:51.001
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

11:51.201 --> 11:53.901
or we will see the police.

11:54.602 --> 11:57.502
If not, no more worries.

11:59.603 --> 12:00.903
All right.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.104
We are off the warehouse phone now?

12:07.204 --> 12:10.005
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.706
This is bullshit.

12:12.705 --> 12:16.506
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

12:27.008 --> 12:28.208
Five-O!

12:33.409 --> 12:36.609
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

12:36.710 --> 12:39.411
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

12:43.811 --> 12:45.612
Come on, keep moving.

12:46.411 --> 12:47.911
Get him. Down.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.813
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

12:58.414 --> 13:01.114
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

13:01.214 --> 13:04.014
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

13:05.515 --> 13:08.516
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

13:08.616 --> 13:11.516
-What are you doing in the Pit then?
-Saying no to drugs.

13:11.616 --> 13:15.516
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

13:16.817 --> 13:20.018
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

13:21.418 --> 13:23.818
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

13:23.918 --> 13:25.119
Slide over, asshole.

13:25.218 --> 13:29.219
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.420
What exactly is it that we're doing?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.921
Young boy killed over bullshit.

13:38.021 --> 13:41.521
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.622
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

13:46.922 --> 13:51.323
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

13:52.324 --> 13:54.824
I'll be out there selling that real.

13:54.924 --> 13:56.824
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

13:56.924 --> 14:01.525
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

14:02.126 --> 14:03.726
You're Westside.

14:04.026 --> 14:06.926
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

14:07.327 --> 14:08.326
No.

14:08.427 --> 14:11.027
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

14:11.127 --> 14:13.928
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

14:14.028 --> 14:17.128
-Sollers?
-Sold heroin like it was water.

14:17.229 --> 14:20.029
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

14:20.129 --> 14:23.029
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.130
I know you don't.

14:25.729 --> 14:27.430
And the police don't.

14:27.730 --> 14:31.331
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

14:31.431 --> 14:34.031
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

14:34.631 --> 14:39.432
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

14:40.532 --> 14:44.133
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

14:44.433 --> 14:46.134
I know. I been there.

14:46.534 --> 14:48.333
But you ain't gotta live by it.

14:51.335 --> 14:52.835
Avon's a soldier.

14:53.835 --> 14:56.635
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.936
But as far as business go....

15:03.937 --> 15:07.438
-You still got that connect?
-Right off the boat, String.

15:08.838 --> 15:10.138
All right.

15:10.738 --> 15:13.839
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

15:14.838 --> 15:17.939
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

15:18.039 --> 15:22.740
You can have 734, 770 and 221 .

15:24.440 --> 15:26.241
I keep the other three.

15:26.941 --> 15:29.141
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

15:30.442 --> 15:32.342
It makes sense, don't it?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.743
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

15:38.643 --> 15:39.743
Right?

15:50.045 --> 15:51.346
No shit.

16:00.247 --> 16:03.647
-I thought you was in with Nicky.
-Fuck Nick.

16:04.348 --> 16:05.948
He said you was his other half.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.848
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

16:08.949 --> 16:10.549
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

16:10.649 --> 16:13.649
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

16:13.749 --> 16:16.449
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

16:16.550 --> 16:17.851
A man can grow.

16:18.750 --> 16:23.151
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

16:23.251 --> 16:24.651
I'm telling you.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.652
You want in?

16:28.452 --> 16:32.453
-What do I gotta do?
-What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

16:33.153 --> 16:36.854
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

16:37.154 --> 16:40.154
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

16:43.555 --> 16:47.655
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

16:47.956 --> 16:49.956
New Charles in the house.

16:51.556 --> 16:53.956
-Moving pretty good.
-Waiting on a prosthetic.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.157
You got a decent lawyer?

16:55.257 --> 16:58.058
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.458
What's with the duck?

17:03.559 --> 17:06.559
-You know you gotta let go of your name.
-Say what?

17:06.659 --> 17:10.060
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.861
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

17:12.260 --> 17:14.060
You know what? "Peg."

17:14.961 --> 17:16.361
"New Peggy."

17:17.560 --> 17:20.060
-How about "Tilt"?
-Tilt?

17:20.461 --> 17:23.063
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

17:25.362 --> 17:27.563
Tilt. I like that.

17:35.464 --> 17:37.165
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.265
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

17:39.366 --> 17:43.666
-So, this is your first time?
-Yep, first time for me.

17:44.066 --> 17:46.666
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.467
-Do you work with the police?
-No. Christ, no.

17:49.967 --> 17:54.168
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know....

17:54.568 --> 17:57.568
-Where do you live?
-I'm not gonna tell you that.

17:59.168 --> 18:00.869
I live out of town.

18:01.169 --> 18:04.269
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

18:04.369 --> 18:05.470
Thank you.

18:10.271 --> 18:12.571
You sucked. I mean, really.

18:12.771 --> 18:14.772
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

18:14.872 --> 18:18.473
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

18:31.075 --> 18:32.575
Hey, fucknuts.

18:33.376 --> 18:35.375
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:39.576 --> 18:41.077
Christ, Ziggy.

18:51.878 --> 18:53.879
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

19:10.582 --> 19:12.383
What's up with my cousin?

19:12.483 --> 19:15.283
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

19:20.584 --> 19:23.384
-Drank himself to death.
-Oh, shit.

19:23.484 --> 19:26.785
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

19:26.885 --> 19:28.686
That boy ain't right.

19:29.285 --> 19:32.586
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.887
La-Z-Boys?

19:41.087 --> 19:43.988
And Davinas. Male and female.

19:44.688 --> 19:45.788
Dope and coke.

19:45.888 --> 19:48.889
-What the hell is a Davina?
-It's like a love seat, kind of.

19:48.989 --> 19:51.690
-Any line on weight?
-All whole numbers.

19:51.889 --> 19:55.090
-No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
-Ounces?

19:55.290 --> 19:58.290
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

19:58.390 --> 20:00.291
Nothing much above five.

20:00.891 --> 20:03.691
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

20:03.792 --> 20:07.593
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

20:07.893 --> 20:10.593
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

20:10.593 --> 20:11.292
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.593
-What was coming and going last night?
-Not much.

20:14.693 --> 20:17.094
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

20:17.194 --> 20:19.894
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

20:19.994 --> 20:24.196
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

20:24.795 --> 20:27.596
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

20:27.696 --> 20:29.996
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.297
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

20:32.397 --> 20:34.497
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

20:34.597 --> 20:35.797
All we need is the new number.

20:35.897 --> 20:37.898
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

20:38.098 --> 20:40.299
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

20:40.499 --> 20:41.799
Probably going to a cell phone.

20:41.899 --> 20:44.899
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.

20:45.099 --> 20:46.399
Okay, then.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.700
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.901
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.301
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

20:54.401 --> 20:56.902
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

20:57.001 --> 20:59.702
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

20:59.802 --> 21:01.803
But so far, the people handling the girls...

21:01.902 --> 21:03.902
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

21:04.002 --> 21:06.403
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

21:06.503 --> 21:07.803
Questions?

21:14.004 --> 21:16.405
What was your play with those girls?

21:17.105 --> 21:18.705
Out-of-town salesman.

21:18.805 --> 21:20.906
-How far out of town?
-What do you mean?

21:21.006 --> 21:23.007
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

21:23.106 --> 21:24.706
Less like a cop you sound.

21:24.806 --> 21:26.007
You do any accents?

21:26.107 --> 21:28.207
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

21:28.307 --> 21:29.508
Crikey!

21:30.007 --> 21:33.308
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

21:33.408 --> 21:37.908
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.510
Work on it, son.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.709
$200,000?

21:43.610 --> 21:45.711
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

21:45.811 --> 21:49.811
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

21:50.011 --> 21:52.212
-And then?
-That is all.

21:56.913 --> 21:59.713
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

21:59.813 --> 22:01.413
They are cheats.

22:01.713 --> 22:04.714
-The chemicals we sent are good, no?
-No complaint.

22:04.814 --> 22:06.915
They say they want more, even.

22:07.015 --> 22:10.915
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

22:11.515 --> 22:12.415
Right.

22:14.315 --> 22:17.316
-And still, they try to chisel.
-Why?

22:18.217 --> 22:20.017
What are they thinking?

22:20.817 --> 22:22.917
That it is all profit for us.

22:23.617 --> 22:26.118
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

22:26.318 --> 22:29.018
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.119
The Greek will be angry.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.419
This is business, Eton.

22:35.719 --> 22:38.720
The Greek? He will be smart.

22:47.522 --> 22:48.722
Jesus.

22:48.922 --> 22:51.722
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

22:51.822 --> 22:53.823
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

22:54.023 --> 22:55.723
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

22:55.823 --> 22:58.123
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

22:58.223 --> 22:59.523
Said the crime will not stand.

22:59.724 --> 23:02.425
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

23:02.525 --> 23:03.825
How about the street talk?

23:03.925 --> 23:06.825
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

23:06.925 --> 23:09.125
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

23:09.225 --> 23:12.126
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

23:12.227 --> 23:14.126
around one of our interrogation rooms?

23:14.226 --> 23:17.027
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

23:17.327 --> 23:20.927
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

23:26.629 --> 23:28.929
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

23:29.129 --> 23:31.029
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

23:31.130 --> 23:34.330
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

23:34.430 --> 23:35.930
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

23:36.030 --> 23:38.331
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

23:38.431 --> 23:39.531
Nothing stripped.

23:39.631 --> 23:41.931
-Off the docks?
-No shit, off the docks.

23:42.031 --> 23:44.832
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

23:44.933 --> 23:46.133
Twenty on the dollar.

23:46.233 --> 23:50.533
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

23:50.633 --> 23:52.133
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

23:52.233 --> 23:55.234
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

23:55.334 --> 23:58.634
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

23:59.135 --> 24:02.736
A stolen car is a stolen car.

24:03.035 --> 24:05.536
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

24:05.636 --> 24:08.737
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

24:08.837 --> 24:11.537
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

24:11.637 --> 24:14.337
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

24:14.437 --> 24:17.038
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

24:17.138 --> 24:19.438
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

24:19.538 --> 24:22.839
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.240
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

24:29.340 --> 24:32.241
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

24:32.340 --> 24:35.442
Stepney and Mersey.

24:35.841 --> 24:36.742
Excuse me?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.942
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

24:40.042 --> 24:43.043
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

24:43.143 --> 24:44.843
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

24:44.943 --> 24:47.844
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.244
Good work.

24:49.544 --> 24:52.144
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

24:52.244 --> 24:54.645
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

24:54.745 --> 24:57.445
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

24:57.545 --> 25:00.646
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

25:02.546 --> 25:04.147
One other thing.

25:05.347 --> 25:07.948
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

25:08.048 --> 25:10.848
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

25:10.948 --> 25:12.849
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

25:13.049 --> 25:15.349
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

25:15.449 --> 25:17.349
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

25:17.449 --> 25:19.949
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

25:20.249 --> 25:23.050
So what? You do that to everybody.

25:25.951 --> 25:27.051
This is George Glekas.

25:27.151 --> 25:31.451
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

25:34.153 --> 25:35.753
Run his ass, too.

25:37.353 --> 25:40.454
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

25:40.654 --> 25:43.554
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

25:43.654 --> 25:45.655
is gonna suspect an inside job.

25:45.854 --> 25:47.754
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

25:47.854 --> 25:49.855
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

25:49.955 --> 25:52.855
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

25:52.955 --> 25:53.955
Why bother?

25:54.055 --> 25:57.057
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.956
That ain't the plan.

26:05.357 --> 26:07.058
I just saw a can disappear.

26:07.158 --> 26:09.559
-Talco line?
-Pakusa working it?

26:09.759 --> 26:13.559
-It's him. Do we try to follow?
-We know where it's going, right?

26:15.159 --> 26:16.260
1 2-08, you copy?

26:17.560 --> 26:19.461
1 2-08, what's up?

26:20.060 --> 26:22.861
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

26:22.961 --> 26:26.262
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

26:26.561 --> 26:30.462
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

26:31.163 --> 26:34.464
-What do you want us to do with it?
-See if it arrives.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.164
And if it does?

26:38.464 --> 26:40.264
See what happens then.

26:42.265 --> 26:44.465
You wanna know something, Carv?

26:44.765 --> 26:47.266
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

26:47.366 --> 26:49.365
we're not really respected.

26:51.166 --> 26:52.966
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

26:53.066 --> 26:55.467
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

26:55.567 --> 26:57.068
Who do I tell?

26:57.368 --> 27:01.168
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

27:01.268 --> 27:03.168
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

27:03.268 --> 27:04.969
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

27:05.069 --> 27:06.069
Here...

27:06.769 --> 27:09.569
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

27:09.670 --> 27:12.470
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.671
-Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
-Fuck it.

27:14.771 --> 27:16.871
What you got there, brother?

27:20.771 --> 27:23.172
White boys. A different look for you.

27:23.272 --> 27:27.072
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

27:27.173 --> 27:29.473
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

27:29.573 --> 27:32.574
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

27:41.176 --> 27:43.076
You said Customs had intel on him?

27:43.175 --> 27:46.476
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

27:50.077 --> 27:53.578
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

27:53.678 --> 27:54.878
Got something out of San Diego.

27:55.078 --> 27:56.878
-On Glekas?
-We'll see.

28:03.479 --> 28:05.480
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

28:05.580 --> 28:07.580
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.981
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

28:10.081 --> 28:13.281
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

28:13.682 --> 28:15.182
Agent Koutris?

28:15.682 --> 28:16.982
Not much to it.

28:17.381 --> 28:21.283
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

28:22.083 --> 28:25.683
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

28:25.983 --> 28:29.084
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

28:29.985 --> 28:32.885
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

28:33.985 --> 28:35.186
All right.

28:35.685 --> 28:37.786
If you need it, let me know.

29:03.991 --> 29:05.291
We need to talk.

29:14.193 --> 29:15.793
Anyone following?

29:28.295 --> 29:31.495
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

29:31.596 --> 29:33.996
-All week I've done it. Nothing.
-Again.

29:38.397 --> 29:39.997
The truck is here.

29:41.397 --> 29:42.998
Lester, it's here.

29:43.398 --> 29:45.298
They offload anything?

29:45.598 --> 29:46.699
Not yet.

29:46.899 --> 29:48.499
Okay, wait on it.

29:50.199 --> 29:54.500
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.801
You are.

29:56.900 --> 30:00.101
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

30:00.801 --> 30:02.101
He doesn't think so.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.802
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

30:05.902 --> 30:08.302
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

30:08.402 --> 30:09.803
We know what happened.

30:09.903 --> 30:13.703
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

30:20.204 --> 30:22.205
Where that lawyer at, man?

30:30.206 --> 30:31.506
See, you just fucked up.

30:31.606 --> 30:34.507
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

30:34.607 --> 30:38.208
That's you, right there, fucking up.

30:47.310 --> 30:49.910
-I don't know what you talking about.
-No, you fucked up.

30:50.110 --> 30:53.911
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

30:54.911 --> 30:56.311
Which one?

31:04.012 --> 31:05.913
That's you right there.

31:10.014 --> 31:11.214
Lawyer.

31:13.315 --> 31:15.314
They were asking about me?

31:17.115 --> 31:18.515
San Diego.

31:19.716 --> 31:22.216
San Diego was a long time ago.

31:23.016 --> 31:24.917
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.117
Only that the people asked.

31:27.217 --> 31:31.418
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

31:31.517 --> 31:32.818
They were.

31:33.117 --> 31:34.318
No FBl.

31:35.919 --> 31:38.118
We've been running only clean containers?

31:38.218 --> 31:41.919
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

31:42.220 --> 31:44.020
No one stops anything.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.921
And we changed the warehouse phone?

31:48.120 --> 31:52.021
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

31:53.321 --> 31:56.622
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

31:58.122 --> 32:01.023
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

32:01.223 --> 32:02.623
Fair is fair.

32:03.223 --> 32:04.924
The Colombians, I think.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.424
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

32:08.525 --> 32:11.825
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

32:12.425 --> 32:16.526
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

32:19.026 --> 32:22.527
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

32:22.627 --> 32:24.027
They're trash.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.928
The world is a smaller place now.

32:30.228 --> 32:34.529
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.630
Fair is fair.

32:42.931 --> 32:44.731
Sergei's making a call.

32:48.732 --> 32:51.732
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

32:51.832 --> 32:53.632
I will meet you there.

32:53.933 --> 32:55.233
Recognize that voice?

32:55.333 --> 32:57.433
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

32:57.534 --> 33:00.334
-That's the same guy?
-Same guy, new number.

33:02.034 --> 33:04.834
-Who you calling?
-Pearlman, at home.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.935
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

33:25.239 --> 33:27.039
Shit is raw, String.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.939
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.539
All right.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.740
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

33:35.840 --> 33:38.341
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

33:38.541 --> 33:39.641
All right.

33:43.641 --> 33:47.442
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

33:47.642 --> 33:49.043
Start connecting the dots...

33:49.143 --> 33:52.343
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

33:52.443 --> 33:55.243
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

33:55.644 --> 33:56.944
FBI didn't have much.

33:57.044 --> 33:59.145
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

33:59.245 --> 34:02.345
-in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
-San Diego?

34:02.846 --> 34:04.746
These guys move around.

34:05.646 --> 34:08.047
-What's with the suit?
-Date night.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.647
The undercover at the brothel.

34:11.746 --> 34:13.547
Run like hell, ma'am.

34:13.647 --> 34:17.148
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

34:17.248 --> 34:18.947
Who's the affiant?

34:27.849 --> 34:31.951
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.051
Whatever you need, chief.

34:34.150 --> 34:36.251
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

34:36.351 --> 34:37.650
Whatever you have.

34:37.851 --> 34:40.952
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

34:41.652 --> 34:43.253
It's a long story.

34:43.952 --> 34:48.254
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so....

34:48.953 --> 34:50.254
Listen...

34:50.554 --> 34:53.054
you think I can get an advance on this?

34:53.155 --> 34:56.554
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

34:57.555 --> 35:00.156
-I'm just asking.
-Payment on delivery.

35:00.455 --> 35:01.857
Don't worry about it, chief.

35:01.956 --> 35:05.657
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

35:06.457 --> 35:10.357
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

35:10.457 --> 35:13.458
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

35:13.558 --> 35:16.359
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

35:16.459 --> 35:18.359
No, that's not enough.

35:18.459 --> 35:21.759
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

35:21.859 --> 35:25.560
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

35:25.660 --> 35:29.661
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.961
But when push come to shove...

35:32.562 --> 35:35.362
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

35:35.462 --> 35:38.463
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

35:38.563 --> 35:42.364
-Hold up, String--
-No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

35:42.564 --> 35:44.864
You drive the guns to the water.

35:44.964 --> 35:49.364
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

35:50.165 --> 35:51.565
In the water.

35:52.665 --> 35:54.066
Splash.

35:57.866 --> 36:00.267
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

36:01.967 --> 36:03.768
Except you, young one.

36:12.269 --> 36:13.869
You ain't say shit back there?

36:13.969 --> 36:17.770
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

36:17.870 --> 36:19.971
And I wiped them shits down myself.

36:20.071 --> 36:22.571
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

36:23.671 --> 36:27.872
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

36:34.873 --> 36:36.873
-All right.
-All right, String.

36:37.974 --> 36:39.474
Lock that door.

36:46.375 --> 36:49.376
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

36:49.476 --> 36:50.876
Got two in the window there.

36:50.876 --> 36:51.576
Got two in the window there.

36:53.376 --> 36:55.377
You hung this on a duck?

36:57.377 --> 36:58.678
Of course.

37:00.278 --> 37:01.478
$1,200.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.579
Fair enough.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.481
-Nick.
-It's been a while, Mikey.

37:17.081 --> 37:18.181
Yeah, it has.

37:18.281 --> 37:21.081
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

37:21.181 --> 37:22.281
Yeah?

37:22.582 --> 37:23.582
My man called.

37:23.682 --> 37:25.582
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.

37:25.682 --> 37:27.883
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.883
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

37:31.384 --> 37:32.984
Who fucking knew?

37:33.683 --> 37:36.884
-So how much you looking for?
-Two or three G-packs a week.

37:37.284 --> 37:39.485
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

37:39.585 --> 37:41.085
-Four each.
-Four?

37:41.386 --> 37:43.385
I wholesale for five, man.

37:44.686 --> 37:46.086
I don't know.

37:46.186 --> 37:49.287
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

37:53.088 --> 37:55.188
Sergei. What up, dawg?

37:55.288 --> 37:58.588
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

37:58.788 --> 37:59.688
Yeah?

38:00.088 --> 38:02.489
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

38:03.189 --> 38:04.589
Another thing.

38:04.989 --> 38:06.590
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

38:06.690 --> 38:09.990
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

38:10.391 --> 38:13.191
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

38:13.291 --> 38:16.091
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

38:16.191 --> 38:19.492
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

38:19.792 --> 38:22.493
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

38:23.393 --> 38:24.293
Idiot.

38:25.394 --> 38:27.994
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

38:28.394 --> 38:30.894
-Four a pack for you.
-All right, cool.

38:36.996 --> 38:38.895
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.

38:38.995 --> 38:43.097
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

38:43.197 --> 38:46.698
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

38:46.898 --> 38:49.698
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

39:02.800 --> 39:06.501
-What the fuck is that?
-It's a man's purse.

39:06.801 --> 39:10.301
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

39:11.601 --> 39:14.102
Them people ain't right over there.

39:14.403 --> 39:16.602
The mike has to go somewhere.

39:16.702 --> 39:20.904
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

39:21.004 --> 39:22.604
Indeed I might, luv.

39:22.704 --> 39:25.504
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

39:25.604 --> 39:29.205
You want us in, you say.... What was it?

39:29.605 --> 39:32.805
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

39:33.606 --> 39:36.706
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

39:36.806 --> 39:40.307
then an overt attempt to engage.

39:42.607 --> 39:43.808
Spot on.

39:44.107 --> 39:46.908
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.509
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

39:51.609 --> 39:55.210
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

39:55.709 --> 39:57.310
Middle Atlantic region probably.

40:28.516 --> 40:32.817
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

40:33.016 --> 40:36.018
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

40:36.118 --> 40:38.017
Congratulations, Frank.

40:42.519 --> 40:45.119
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

41:03.222 --> 41:05.323
So, Nat, about the election.

41:07.723 --> 41:10.224
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

41:10.324 --> 41:12.024
That's what I need.

41:13.424 --> 41:15.025
Ott's turn, Frank.

41:18.625 --> 41:21.626
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

41:21.726 --> 41:24.926
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

41:25.326 --> 41:27.827
-Terrorism?
-He needs our help tonight.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.931
1 1-34, what's your 20?

41:49.830 --> 41:52.231
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

41:53.031 --> 41:54.332
Copy that.

41:58.132 --> 41:59.832
Okay, we're on here.

42:03.133 --> 42:04.733
Good evening.

42:23.437 --> 42:24.537
Paint pigments.

42:24.637 --> 42:28.038
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.339
It's in there somewhere.

42:30.838 --> 42:31.939
Run it.

43:01.543 --> 43:04.245
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

43:04.944 --> 43:06.644
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

43:06.644 --> 43:07.645
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.746
-What's going on?
-I don't know nothing, Horse.

43:15.947 --> 43:17.047
Swear to God.

43:17.147 --> 43:20.447
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

43:35.750 --> 43:38.151
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

43:38.351 --> 43:41.852
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

43:41.952 --> 43:44.852
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

43:44.952 --> 43:46.352
You think so?

43:47.352 --> 43:51.553
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

43:52.053 --> 43:55.954
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

43:56.054 --> 43:57.654
and what happened?

43:58.854 --> 44:00.454
He feel for that.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.155
He feel for you.

44:04.155 --> 44:06.456
I know he didn't see it coming.

44:06.956 --> 44:09.456
-None of us seen it coming.
-I did.

44:10.757 --> 44:12.357
I swear, I saw it.

44:13.057 --> 44:17.458
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

44:17.758 --> 44:19.458
'Cause we got a weak product...

44:19.559 --> 44:23.559
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

44:23.659 --> 44:27.060
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.161
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

44:36.361 --> 44:37.462
I know.

44:39.062 --> 44:41.362
But them wolves is at that door.

44:48.864 --> 44:53.264
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

44:54.364 --> 44:58.766
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

44:59.365 --> 45:01.066
So I'll talk to him.

45:26.870 --> 45:28.370
Mr. Cromwell.

45:30.671 --> 45:32.472
Decisions, decisions.

45:35.172 --> 45:37.673
Would it be wrong to take two?

45:39.573 --> 45:40.773
Attaboy.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.773
We should get upstairs.

45:48.174 --> 45:50.975
Nothing but paint pigments.

45:51.074 --> 45:53.475
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

46:10.579 --> 46:12.478
Son of a bitch!

46:26.582 --> 46:27.882
Okay, then.

46:30.282 --> 46:31.382
Right.

46:32.382 --> 46:35.183
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

46:44.085 --> 46:45.685
Any time you guys want.

46:45.985 --> 46:47.786
The money changed hands, right?

46:47.886 --> 46:49.486
Sounded that way.

46:49.786 --> 46:52.686
-And they talked about sex?
-Definitely.

46:52.887 --> 46:54.587
Any time you guys want.

46:54.687 --> 46:55.887
Hang on.

46:57.788 --> 46:58.787
Oh, God.

47:00.588 --> 47:01.988
Is it soup yet?

47:02.588 --> 47:05.088
Spot something. Spot on it.

47:05.288 --> 47:06.288
Let's go.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.591
-Whoa.
-Why?

47:15.691 --> 47:17.891
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

47:17.991 --> 47:19.091
Calm the fuck down.

47:19.191 --> 47:22.491
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

47:26.492 --> 47:28.593
-Who is it?
-Baltimore police.

47:29.493 --> 47:32.194
-What do you want?
-To lock your ass up.

47:38.295 --> 47:40.495
Hands. Let me see them.

47:53.298 --> 47:55.998
-Two more in the back.
-Come on, ladies.

48:12.601 --> 48:14.001
You're late.

48:17.802 --> 48:19.002
He okay?

48:20.302 --> 48:21.602
He'll live.

48:24.803 --> 48:29.004
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...

48:29.104 --> 48:32.405
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

48:32.604 --> 48:35.205
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

48:35.405 --> 48:37.106
that their investigation is ongoing...

48:37.206 --> 48:39.205
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

48:39.305 --> 48:42.806
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

48:42.906 --> 48:45.907
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist--

48:47.007 --> 48:49.307
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

48:51.408 --> 48:56.209
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

48:56.709 --> 48:58.410
I would die happy.

49:01.410 --> 49:02.810
Our case is progressing.

49:02.910 --> 49:05.710
-Great, what can you charge?
-We're not at that point.

49:05.810 --> 49:09.712
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

49:09.812 --> 49:12.512
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

49:12.612 --> 49:14.713
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

49:14.813 --> 49:18.813
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

49:18.913 --> 49:21.114
And last night, if you check the 24s...

49:21.214 --> 49:23.714
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

49:23.814 --> 49:25.714
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

49:25.814 --> 49:28.314
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

49:28.414 --> 49:32.215
-You hit a brothel?
-Waterfront condo, high-end.

49:32.816 --> 49:34.016
Jesus.

49:34.615 --> 49:38.917
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

49:39.117 --> 49:42.618
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

49:44.018 --> 49:46.017
Any problems on the raid?

49:46.218 --> 49:49.718
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

49:49.818 --> 49:51.619
Immigration is holding the girls.

49:51.719 --> 49:55.220
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

49:55.320 --> 49:57.420
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

49:57.520 --> 49:58.721
Not while the taps are up.

49:58.821 --> 50:02.320
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

50:02.320 --> 50:02.921
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

50:03.021 --> 50:06.722
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

50:06.822 --> 50:09.322
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

50:09.422 --> 50:10.922
then, yeah, we're closer.

50:11.022 --> 50:14.523
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

50:14.723 --> 50:16.724
What about Frank Sobotka?

50:17.123 --> 50:19.524
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

50:19.624 --> 50:21.525
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

50:21.625 --> 50:24.625
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

50:24.725 --> 50:28.026
This is about Frank Sobotka.

50:28.425 --> 50:30.326
The case is bigger now.

50:30.926 --> 50:35.427
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

50:36.227 --> 50:40.928
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

50:41.028 --> 50:43.528
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

50:43.628 --> 50:45.229
and a chance at the real targets.

50:45.329 --> 50:48.729
-He is the real target.
-Patience, Stan.

50:49.430 --> 50:53.030
-I'm sure if they bring the case--
-You owe me on this, Erv.

50:53.530 --> 50:56.631
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

50:57.331 --> 51:00.131
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

51:02.432 --> 51:03.532
Okay.

51:05.633 --> 51:06.733
Now the votes are in...

51:06.833 --> 51:10.833
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

51:10.933 --> 51:13.034
now you're freezing me out, huh?

51:14.134 --> 51:16.334
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

51:18.235 --> 51:19.835
This is my case.

51:20.336 --> 51:21.435
Mine!

51:21.636 --> 51:25.136
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

51:26.136 --> 51:28.637
Not fucking likely.

51:37.338 --> 51:38.838
He's saying no.

51:40.238 --> 51:42.839
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

51:42.940 --> 51:45.440
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

51:45.540 --> 51:48.540
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

51:48.640 --> 51:51.041
and we might never get out from under.

51:51.141 --> 51:54.742
-We don't have the product or the muscle.
-I told him.

51:55.642 --> 51:56.742
I did.

51:58.742 --> 52:01.943
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

52:02.143 --> 52:03.743
And for muscle...

52:03.843 --> 52:06.743
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

52:08.944 --> 52:10.545
Brother Mouzone.

52:14.745 --> 52:16.545
He sending in Brother?

52:17.446 --> 52:18.946
From New York.

52:19.646 --> 52:23.547
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

52:23.947 --> 52:26.347
-Brother Mouzone?
-Yep.

52:32.249 --> 52:35.249
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

52:35.449 --> 52:39.049
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

52:39.149 --> 52:43.351
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

52:45.351 --> 52:47.951
You're famous behind this, you know that?

52:48.051 --> 52:51.252
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

52:51.352 --> 52:53.752
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

52:53.852 --> 52:58.254
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

52:58.354 --> 53:02.254
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

53:02.354 --> 53:04.855
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

53:04.954 --> 53:08.055
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

53:12.055 --> 53:14.856
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

53:27.159 --> 53:29.259
You fucking with me, right?

53:29.359 --> 53:32.360
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

53:32.959 --> 53:36.660
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.961
-Played it like that.
-Yeah, and he reached out.

53:39.061 --> 53:40.961
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

53:41.061 --> 53:44.062
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

53:44.161 --> 53:45.861
Deal with how?

53:45.961 --> 53:48.563
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

53:48.663 --> 53:51.063
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

53:51.163 --> 53:55.164
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

53:55.264 --> 53:56.464
Shit.

53:56.664 --> 53:59.764
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

53:59.865 --> 54:00.864
True.

54:00.964 --> 54:05.465
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

54:05.865 --> 54:08.366
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

54:08.466 --> 54:11.066
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

54:11.667 --> 54:15.367
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

54:15.467 --> 54:18.868
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

54:18.968 --> 54:20.668
And that's like a week or maybe two.

54:20.768 --> 54:23.368
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

54:23.468 --> 54:26.470
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

54:26.569 --> 54:30.370
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

54:30.570 --> 54:31.570
All right?

54:39.871 --> 54:41.972
1 2-08 to 1 1-37, you there?

54:42.673 --> 54:44.373
1 1-37, what you got?

54:44.572 --> 54:46.773
That last truck is on the move.

54:47.073 --> 54:49.673
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

54:49.873 --> 54:51.974
-10-4.
-They're testing us.

54:52.074 --> 54:54.175
They been moving clean cans.

55:07.177 --> 55:09.777
-The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
-No?

55:09.877 --> 55:13.978
-Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
-Okay, then we go.

55:14.078 --> 55:17.879
-What about llona?
-She is home. They kept the children.

55:18.279 --> 55:20.479
There are always more children.

55:21.979 --> 55:26.380
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

55:27.180 --> 55:29.881
That call might just be our PC.

55:31.281 --> 55:34.382
And this here is the little king of everything.

55:47.584 --> 55:49.685
So how many we got in the sector?

55:49.784 --> 55:53.785
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

55:54.085 --> 55:56.385
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

55:56.485 --> 55:58.286
We're on every corner.

55:59.187 --> 56:01.186
Pretty damn quiet today.

56:02.887 --> 56:03.987
Today.

56:07.687 --> 56:08.888
Let's go.

56:52.496 --> 56:53.696
Officer.
