<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

00:01.601 --> 00:02.968
Well, I would have
invited the baby's mother,

00:03.269 --> 00:04.468
but I never met her.

00:04.469 --> 00:06.804
She was one of Ben's
more productive one night stands.

00:09.441 --> 00:11.141
Okay, three words I never
want to hear again,

00:11.392 --> 00:13.444
"that's so cute."

00:13.445 --> 00:14.444
( Gasps )

00:14.445 --> 00:15.745
Wasn't that cute?

00:17.015 --> 00:18.949
Best shower ever.

00:18.950 --> 00:22.051
Yeah, those five hours
just flew by.

00:22.052 --> 00:23.320
There's not enough
football in the world

00:23.321 --> 00:24.987
to erase
what just happened.

00:24.988 --> 00:26.457
( Gasps )

00:26.688 --> 00:27.457
Wait.

00:27.458 --> 00:28.925
I almost forgot
my present.

00:29.376 --> 00:30.960
So exciting!

00:30.961 --> 00:33.396
There can't actually be more.

00:33.397 --> 00:35.965
I mean, seriously, what are we
gonna do with a wipes warmer?

00:35.966 --> 00:37.833
Oh, I was actually
gonna hold on to that.

00:38.334 --> 00:39.935
Okay.

00:39.936 --> 00:42.504
What? Oh, Emma's the only
one who can appreciate

00:42.505 --> 00:44.706
the soothing comfort
of a warm towelette?

00:46.242 --> 00:48.977
That does sound nice.

00:48.978 --> 00:52.280
Don't worry.
Everything can be returned.

00:52.281 --> 00:55.716
Finally, my little
princess has her carriage.

00:55.717 --> 00:56.717
Isn't it perfect?

00:59.154 --> 01:01.889
Hello, princess.

01:02.190 --> 01:03.523
You said, "everything," right?

01:43.162 --> 01:46.597
Okay, suddenly don't care that dad
never let me drive the convertible.

01:46.598 --> 01:48.065
Ah, it's even got that
new stroller smell.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.968
Oh-h, this thing
is so cool.

01:50.969 --> 01:54.671
- Nice stroller.
- Hello...

01:54.672 --> 01:57.340
And it just got
a whole lot cooler.

01:57.341 --> 01:58.741
We just drove her
off the lot.

01:58.742 --> 02:01.111
Looks fast.

02:01.112 --> 02:04.014
Well, that depends on who's pushing it.
( Chuckles )

02:04.015 --> 02:06.616
There's no way he's
recovering from that line.

02:06.617 --> 02:08.050
Wait.

02:08.051 --> 02:10.120
It's not over yet.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.354
- Okay.
- I'll call you.

02:11.355 --> 02:12.822
That boy's got
confidence.

02:12.823 --> 02:14.523
Stroller
confidence.

02:15.024 --> 02:16.625
Her name's Zoe.

02:16.626 --> 02:18.027
Finally one for the "z"s.

02:18.028 --> 02:19.661
This stroller is amazing.

02:19.662 --> 02:21.662
Yeah, give me the keys.
I'm driving.

02:24.401 --> 02:27.102
That is what I call a
very successful outing.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.970
So why are
we "in-ing"?

02:29.471 --> 02:31.172
We need to get
back on the street.

02:31.173 --> 02:32.974
Dude, what's the rush?

02:32.975 --> 02:34.575
Maybe you haven't noticed.

02:34.576 --> 02:35.676
But I'm
a relationship magnet.

02:37.712 --> 02:40.014
I enjoy casual.
I want casual.

02:40.015 --> 02:41.549
But casual has not
wanted me.

02:41.550 --> 02:43.884
Until now, okay?

02:43.885 --> 02:46.420
This is my fun window, people.
Don't shut it.

02:46.421 --> 02:48.888
( Scoffs ) Wow!
It even works by itself.

02:48.889 --> 02:49.689
That one's mine.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.161
Oh, crap! What's he doing here?

02:54.162 --> 02:55.395
That's Henderson,
the owner.

02:55.396 --> 02:56.430
My shift started
five minutes ago.

02:56.431 --> 02:57.297
You don't know me.

03:00.001 --> 03:01.667
Afternoon, sir.
Things can really pile up

03:01.668 --> 03:02.634
if you don't
stay on top of them.

03:02.635 --> 03:03.836
- Hey, Walker.
- Wheeler.

03:03.837 --> 03:06.072
Whatever.
Have you seen McNeely?

03:06.073 --> 03:08.140
Nope. Could be
in the break room.

03:08.141 --> 03:10.141
Don't know, 'cause I've
never been in there.

03:12.645 --> 03:14.513
Well, let me know
when you do.

03:14.514 --> 03:16.449
I wanna talk to him about a
new management position.

03:16.450 --> 03:17.682
Excuse me,
Mr. Henderson.

03:17.683 --> 03:19.317
Oh, is my father here?

03:20.686 --> 03:22.787
Call me "H."

03:22.788 --> 03:25.223
Oh, you got it, H.

03:25.224 --> 03:27.325
You can call me "W."
( Chuckles )

03:27.326 --> 03:29.627
Or "B" for Ben.

03:29.628 --> 03:30.828
But we're doing the last
name thing, so it's--

03:30.829 --> 03:32.697
What do you want, Walker?

03:32.698 --> 03:36.000
It's Wheel--
never mind.

03:36.001 --> 03:38.268
About that new position, I like to think
of myself as management material.

03:38.269 --> 03:40.637
I'm definitely a leader,
not a follower.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.639
Unless you need
a follower.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.140
And then I'll follow
your lead.

03:45.843 --> 03:48.979
Look, I like you.
I really do.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.347
You're fun, you're personable,
a little flirtatious.

03:51.348 --> 03:54.183
Thank you?
( Weak chuckle )

03:54.184 --> 03:56.119
All qualities I'm looking
for in a bartender.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.121
But not in a manager.

03:58.122 --> 03:59.522
You've got yourself
a dream job, kid.

03:59.523 --> 04:00.056
Enjoy it.

04:01.925 --> 04:03.059
So you'll think
about it?

04:09.732 --> 04:11.732
Finally.
There's my little princess.

04:12.435 --> 04:15.370
Mom, remember,

04:15.371 --> 04:17.738
the school therapist said
you had to stop calling me that.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.909
I thought Emma
was with you.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.108
I got us
matching outfits.

04:25.447 --> 04:26.847
She's out
with the guys.

04:26.848 --> 04:29.116
Something wrong?

04:29.117 --> 04:30.984
- No.
- Did something happen at work?

04:30.985 --> 04:32.719
No, why?
I'm good.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.923
Honey, you can't
hide things from me.

04:35.924 --> 04:37.623
Chip my windshield,
I knew it.

04:37.624 --> 04:39.325
Set the basement
on fire, I knew it.

04:39.326 --> 04:41.594
Got a girl pregnant--

04:41.595 --> 04:43.829
oh my God, you did not get a
girl pregnant again, did you?

04:45.933 --> 04:47.100
Somebody get me
a banana and a condom!

04:50.237 --> 04:53.838
No! I swear,
once is enough.

04:53.839 --> 04:56.741
Do you think I could ever
be more than a bartender?

04:56.742 --> 04:59.878
Honey, it wasn't
the community-college fairy

04:59.879 --> 05:01.080
who left all those brochures
under your pillow.

05:02.949 --> 05:05.917
Of course
you can do more.

05:05.918 --> 05:08.587
You can be
whatever you want to be.

05:08.588 --> 05:10.154
There's a manager
position open at work.

05:10.155 --> 05:12.523
Okay, let's not
go crazy.

05:12.524 --> 05:14.292
It's not just
about me any more.

05:14.293 --> 05:15.393
It's Emma's
future too.

05:15.394 --> 05:17.895
Well then,
you go back there

05:17.896 --> 05:18.963
and don't take "no"
for an answer.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.033
Unless there's a chance
he might fire you

05:23.034 --> 05:24.902
from the job you already
have for being too pushy.

05:24.903 --> 05:27.504
Then, you know what?
I'd just let it go.

05:27.505 --> 05:29.005
- Thanks for the pep talk, Mom.
- Anytime, princess.

05:31.509 --> 05:33.210
Hey, check it out.

05:33.211 --> 05:34.944
Two different girls,
two different numbers.

05:34.945 --> 05:36.446
Or as I like
to call it,

05:36.447 --> 05:38.148
"hot guy problem."

05:38.149 --> 05:39.983
( Laughs )
What? I don't know.

05:39.984 --> 05:42.585
I got 11.

05:42.586 --> 05:45.254
I'm new at this.

05:45.255 --> 05:47.123
Savor it, because that might
have been your last ride.

05:47.124 --> 05:49.291
- Mom's here.
- Now?

05:49.292 --> 05:51.393
Wait? What are
we gonna do?

05:51.394 --> 05:53.962
- No, I need this stroller.
- Relax, my little friend.

05:53.963 --> 05:56.599
I'll handle Mom.
Take this.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.066
All right, Emma.
Let's go get Daddy a promotion.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.835
But let me do
the talking.

06:00.836 --> 06:03.505
Come on.
And remember,

06:03.506 --> 06:04.839
just follow
my lead.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.574
- Okay.
- ( Elevator bell dings )

06:06.575 --> 06:09.010
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

06:09.011 --> 06:10.445
- Tucker sold your stroller!
- Oh my God, you tattletale!

06:10.446 --> 06:11.879
What?!

06:11.880 --> 06:13.147
Oh!

06:13.148 --> 06:14.714
( Groaning )

06:19.621 --> 06:21.121
Ah-ah.

06:21.122 --> 06:22.556
Oh-oh, ah-ah-ah.

06:22.557 --> 06:24.057
( Mutters )

06:31.731 --> 06:33.699
- Riley!
- Hi.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.933
Perfect. Can you watch
Emma for two seconds?

06:34.934 --> 06:35.801
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:35.802 --> 06:37.170
Ooh, sweet ride.

06:39.506 --> 06:41.707
H. Hey,
what's happening?

06:41.708 --> 06:44.910
It's me--
Wheeler Walker W,

06:44.911 --> 06:47.579
your slightly
flirtatious barkeep.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.947
Don't you ever
go home, Walker?

06:49.948 --> 06:53.151
I have wives
I see less than you.

06:53.152 --> 06:55.253
I was just thinking about our
conversation from earlier.

06:55.254 --> 06:57.254
And I think you're wrong
and I'm right.

06:58.357 --> 07:00.358
I mean-- I mean
I'm right for the job,

07:00.359 --> 07:02.259
and you're wrong
not to consider me.

07:02.260 --> 07:04.127
Hmm. Wow.
When I said this to my myself

07:04.128 --> 07:06.129
in the bathroom mirror,
it was really smooth.

07:06.130 --> 07:09.600
Look, I appreciate
the whole "eager kid" thing,

07:09.601 --> 07:12.769
but I'm looking for someone a little more...
responsible.

07:12.770 --> 07:14.238
And that's exactly
what I'm trying to be.

07:14.239 --> 07:15.439
I've got a kid now
and I--

07:15.440 --> 07:17.040
You've got a kid?

07:17.041 --> 07:18.708
Yeah...

07:18.709 --> 07:20.009
Her name's Emma.

07:21.445 --> 07:22.512
And a hot young wife.

07:24.515 --> 07:27.250
Yes.

07:27.251 --> 07:30.920
Yes, I do...
Family man.

07:30.921 --> 07:32.888
And there's nothing more
responsible than that.

07:32.889 --> 07:35.023
You obviously don't know
a lot of family men.

07:35.024 --> 07:37.058
Hi, I am so sorry
to interrupt.

07:37.059 --> 07:38.793
But I've got
to hand her off.

07:38.794 --> 07:40.562
I have an exam in an
hour, and right now,

07:40.563 --> 07:43.498
she knows more about
immigration law than I do.

07:43.499 --> 07:45.601
Little lady goes to law school
and she's running late.

07:45.602 --> 07:47.436
Well, not running,
but she should be.

07:47.437 --> 07:50.271
- Go go go.
- Law school, huh? Must be tough with the baby.

07:50.272 --> 07:52.072
I was just saying how
great you are with Emma.

07:52.073 --> 07:53.774
Okay, give her kiss.
Wave bye-bye.

07:53.775 --> 07:55.809
- Aww, that is so sweet.
- See ya.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.712
But Ben truly does
all the heavy lifting.

07:57.713 --> 07:58.812
I mean, I'm barely
even helping out.

08:02.718 --> 08:05.585
That is one impressive
wife you've got there.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.920
Well, I don't call her
my better half for nothing.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.856
Got a daughter
about her age.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.990
Sadly, they have
nothing in common.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.394
( Sighs )

08:14.395 --> 08:15.827
I might have underestimated
you, Wheeler.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.063
( Small gasp )
Oh my God.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.098
That's the first time
you've said my name.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.735
Let's have lunch tomorrow
and discuss that job.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.504
Oh, and bring your lovely
little barrister with you.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.306
If you can get
a woman like that,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.807
there really must be something
about you I'm missing.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.609
Again, thank you?

08:34.011 --> 08:36.113
What was that about?

08:36.114 --> 08:38.482
Two questions
for you:

08:38.484 --> 08:40.017
What are you doing
tomorrow for lunch?

08:40.018 --> 08:40.951
And...
Will you marry me?

08:42.988 --> 08:43.621
Huh?

08:46.788 --> 08:48.221
I am not pretending
to be your wife.

08:48.387 --> 08:50.121
But I need you!

08:50.122 --> 08:52.424
You're the glue
of my very flimsy lie.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.525
Well, I can't tomorrow.
I'm having lunch with Jack.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.427
- Jack?
- The guy I'm seeing.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.295
In the real world.

08:58.296 --> 08:59.797
Where I'm single
and not breastfeeding.

08:59.798 --> 09:03.267
Okay, how's this?

09:03.268 --> 09:06.070
Once Henderson hires me, we'll get
a quick- but-amicable divorce.

09:06.071 --> 09:09.006
If only you had anything
I wanted half of.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.875
I just want Emma to have a
father she can be proud of.

09:11.876 --> 09:13.844
- ( Sighs )
- Please, you have to help me...

09:13.845 --> 09:16.245
"Riley Wheeler."

09:16.246 --> 09:19.148
I only wrote that in
my notebook every day.

09:19.149 --> 09:21.149
I'm just working
on our backstory.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.553
So you'll do it?

09:23.554 --> 09:24.988
Oh, hell no!

09:28.959 --> 09:30.659
This is going back.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.364
Angry blonde with a baby
coming through, people.

09:35.365 --> 09:37.365
Move it. Come on.
Move it, move it, move it.

09:41.004 --> 09:42.236
Oh, hell no.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.273
This is going back.

09:49.778 --> 09:52.213
Yeah, I just love
being an uncle.

09:52.214 --> 09:54.048
Although technically
I'm more of a friend.

09:54.049 --> 09:55.282
I guess that makes me
a frunkle.

09:55.283 --> 09:57.518
( Both chuckling )

09:57.519 --> 10:00.587
Okay, frunkle.
Let's see that phone.

10:00.588 --> 10:01.254
All right.
( Chuckles )

10:06.160 --> 10:07.728
- Call me.
- Okay.

10:10.164 --> 10:12.399
Impressive.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.567
You seem to be getting
the hang of this.

10:14.568 --> 10:16.301
You up for a little
challenge?

10:16.302 --> 10:18.270
- I'm listening.
- We each take a block.

10:18.271 --> 10:19.872
Whoever lands
the most numbers,

10:19.873 --> 10:21.541
gets the stroller the
whole rest of the day.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.342
Game on.
But I gotta warn you--

10:23.343 --> 10:24.744
Tucker's in the zone.
( Chuckles )

10:24.745 --> 10:26.612
Thanks for
the heads-up, frunkle.

10:26.613 --> 10:28.948
I get this block.

10:28.949 --> 10:30.949
Wait wait wait. You get the
yogurt shop and the nail salon?

10:30.950 --> 10:34.686
Woo! Is it ever
hot out today!

10:34.687 --> 10:38.289
Hey! Hey, man!
That is not fair!

10:38.290 --> 10:39.390
Hey! I wanna
re-negotiate!

10:41.293 --> 10:42.727
Okay, so we met
in high school,

10:42.728 --> 10:44.395
you had a crazy
crush on me,

10:44.396 --> 10:46.896
but were too shy because
of your weight problem.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.901
Wait, I wasn't fat.
You were.

10:50.902 --> 10:52.369
Not if you want
my help, I wasn't.

10:52.370 --> 10:54.972
- ( Door opens )
- We tied!

10:54.973 --> 10:56.440
Well, I had to cry
for two of the numbers.

10:56.441 --> 10:58.508
But we tied.

10:58.509 --> 11:00.778
Wait. You took out
the stroller?

11:00.779 --> 11:02.612
Mom just put Emma
down 10 minutes ago.

11:02.613 --> 11:04.948
Turns out the baby
part is optional.

11:04.949 --> 11:06.348
You just say
she's asleep

11:06.349 --> 11:08.484
and nobody
looks inside.

11:08.485 --> 11:10.352
Okay, but Mom's
still here.

11:10.353 --> 11:12.321
- Now.
- Again?

11:12.322 --> 11:13.590
- Go!
- Oh my God.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.795
Is that Tucker?

11:19.796 --> 11:21.096
He went that way.

11:25.835 --> 11:28.070
I don't know
which is more fun,

11:28.071 --> 11:29.771
siccing Mom on tuck, or cruising
around with that stroller.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.239
Ben, you gotta
get in on it.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.975
Can't. I have
a wife now.

11:33.576 --> 11:34.341
Wait.

11:34.342 --> 11:35.375
How long were we gone?

11:37.713 --> 11:39.313
We are pretending
to be married

11:39.314 --> 11:41.983
so that he can get
a promotion.

11:41.984 --> 11:44.484
Oh, which reminds me, I picked
this up on my way home.

11:46.387 --> 11:48.422
Riley,

11:48.423 --> 11:50.189
will you do me the honor
of being my wife?

11:50.190 --> 11:52.859
( Breathless )
Sure. Yes.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.829
I do.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.063
Riley, are you sure
this is a good idea?

11:57.064 --> 11:57.631
I'm fine!

12:01.535 --> 12:03.069
So when did you first know
you were in love with me?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.105
Um...

12:05.106 --> 12:05.838
After we had sex.

12:09.776 --> 12:12.477
Come on! You have
to paint a picture.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.446
It has to be something
romantic, like--

12:14.447 --> 12:16.015
Spring Break,
freshman year.

12:16.016 --> 12:17.750
Down by
the reservoir.

12:17.751 --> 12:20.152
You were wearing
a blue dress.

12:20.153 --> 12:22.053
And the sun was setting so it
made it look like you had a halo.

12:24.823 --> 12:26.690
Exactly. Something like
that, but not so sappy.

12:30.729 --> 12:33.064
And the sunsets
were incredible.

12:33.065 --> 12:35.933
Not that we ever left the room.
( Chuckles )

12:35.934 --> 12:38.168
Well, Wheeler this has been
an excellent meeting.

12:38.169 --> 12:41.004
- I think I can safely say--
- Hi there.

12:41.005 --> 12:43.940
- Hey, didn't you--
- A-absolutely not!

12:43.941 --> 12:46.143
Sorry, miss, but we're kind of in
the middle of a business meeting.

12:46.144 --> 12:48.879
Take it down a notch, Wheeler.
This is my daughter Zoe.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.281
Your daughter?
( Exhales )

12:51.282 --> 12:53.483
Well, uh, so nice to meet you
for the first time ever.

12:53.484 --> 12:55.117
Nice to meet you too.

12:55.118 --> 12:57.186
Zoe, this is Ben and
his lovely wife Riley.

12:57.187 --> 12:58.654
You should really
get to know each other.

12:58.655 --> 13:00.556
- Oh, that would be--
- Impossible!

13:00.557 --> 13:02.158
'Cause we're about to
head out, right, babe?

13:02.159 --> 13:03.826
Oh, don't leave now.
There's nothing I'd like more than

13:03.827 --> 13:05.394
to chat with you
and your wife.

13:05.395 --> 13:06.895
As soon as
I freshen up.

13:08.899 --> 13:10.999
Wow, where'd all
that iced tea go?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.133
Oops! There it is.
I'll be right back.

13:15.971 --> 13:17.872
Ready for a rematch?

13:17.873 --> 13:21.109
You go.
I'm good.

13:21.110 --> 13:22.543
You ever think you want
just one phone number?

13:22.544 --> 13:24.913
Been there, done that.

13:24.914 --> 13:26.880
These days
I'm shopping in bulk.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.816
( Chuckles )

13:28.817 --> 13:31.484
I'm talking about
one special number.

13:31.485 --> 13:32.619
The kind that makes you want
to delete all the other ones.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.888
Wait...

13:34.889 --> 13:36.623
Is this about Riley?

13:36.624 --> 13:39.392
Who you swear
you don't like?

13:39.393 --> 13:42.729
No. I'm just saying, getting lots
of women to like you is easy.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.797
It's getting one that's hard.
How do I do that?

13:44.798 --> 13:47.700
Okay, so assuming
there is a special girl

13:47.701 --> 13:51.704
whose name doesn't start with
"R" and end with "iley"...

13:51.705 --> 13:53.940
Are you asking my advice
on how to get her?

13:53.941 --> 13:56.175
Yeah. You're the
relationship magnet, right?

13:56.176 --> 13:59.310
Magnetize me.

13:59.311 --> 14:02.013
Fine. Look, if you really
want a relationship,

14:02.014 --> 14:03.749
you gotta tell her
how you feel.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.817
I mean maybe
she's into you too.

14:05.818 --> 14:08.220
Then it's all sweet,
can't wait to see her,

14:08.221 --> 14:10.421
send each other
fun little texts,

14:10.422 --> 14:12.090
get comfortable
together,

14:12.091 --> 14:15.192
maybe even
a little bored.

14:15.193 --> 14:17.294
Until one day you realize
it's not even love any more,

14:17.295 --> 14:19.329
but a horrible dance of pain
that will leave you both

14:19.330 --> 14:20.931
damaged, empty shells
for years to come!

14:21.932 --> 14:23.332
That sounds nice.

14:27.105 --> 14:30.039
( Stammering ) I know this looks
horrible, but I'm not a cheater.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.941
I'm just faking being married so
your dad will consider me for a job.

14:31.942 --> 14:33.977
So you're a liar?

14:33.978 --> 14:35.879
I'd probably go
with creative go-getter.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.047
No worries.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.916
Scamming my dad
is my favorite pastime.

14:40.417 --> 14:41.517
So you won't
say anything?

14:42.018 --> 14:43.920
Not a word.

14:43.921 --> 14:46.488
So how about you
show me your resume?

14:46.489 --> 14:48.489
That's not where I keep it.
( Nervous chuckle )

14:50.226 --> 14:53.128
- Seriously?
- Riley, it's not what it looks like.

14:53.129 --> 14:55.030
Really? Because it looks
like you abandoned me

14:55.031 --> 14:56.932
to shove your tongue down
some stranger's throat.

14:56.933 --> 14:58.700
Wrong! She was shoving
her tongue down my throat.

14:58.701 --> 15:00.201
I was trying
to push it out.

15:01.337 --> 15:03.203
Ben Wheeler, I hate you.

15:09.637 --> 15:11.503
Okay Wheeler,
it's go time.

15:11.762 --> 15:13.663
Take your best shot
and tell her how you feel.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.897
No matter what
you can't turn back.

15:17.001 --> 15:18.768
Danny?

15:18.769 --> 15:20.270
What are you
doing here?

15:20.271 --> 15:21.771
Can I use
your bathroom?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.374
Your brother
is such a jerk.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.075
If you ever see me
offering to help him again,

15:26.076 --> 15:27.609
you have to promise
to stop me.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.479
- I promise.
- ( Sighs ) Take this.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.880
God, I can't believe Ben would
just take our fake relationship

15:31.881 --> 15:34.249
and throw it all away.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.952
Well, maybe it's time
for a real relationship.

15:36.953 --> 15:38.520
You know, with a
real guy who's--

15:38.521 --> 15:40.522
Not a gigantic tool.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.224
- Go away, Ben.
- I'm so sorry.

15:43.225 --> 15:45.460
That girl-- I hit on her a couple
days ago with the stroller.

15:45.461 --> 15:47.395
Did not know she was
my boss's daughter.

15:47.396 --> 15:48.896
When she came, and I went
after her to be like,

15:48.897 --> 15:50.431
"hey, don't tell
your dad."

15:50.432 --> 15:52.733
Then she went all psycho
and started kissing me.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.802
I would never do something like that.
Danny, back me up here.

15:54.803 --> 15:57.437
Oh, I think
you're doing great.

15:57.438 --> 15:59.006
I don't even care
about the job any more.

15:59.007 --> 16:00.507
All I care about
is you.

16:00.508 --> 16:02.042
I'm listening.

16:02.043 --> 16:03.776
You were so sweet
to help me.

16:03.777 --> 16:05.712
Keep going.

16:05.713 --> 16:07.780
Well, I'm gonna
tell Henderson

16:07.781 --> 16:09.781
that he was right about
you and wrong about me.

16:11.319 --> 16:12.886
You're never gonna
get that promotion.

16:12.887 --> 16:14.853
No, but maybe
I'll get you back.

16:14.854 --> 16:17.188
I'll take a real friend
over fake wife any day.

16:19.459 --> 16:21.660
Or... we could go back
in there one more time.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.862
Danny:
Wait.

16:23.863 --> 16:25.331
This is the part where I'm
supposed to stop you.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.333
Riley, stay strong.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.700
Well...

16:29.701 --> 16:32.470
I mean we already
made it this far.

16:32.471 --> 16:34.972
At least if you get the job, I won't
feel like I totally wasted my time.

16:34.973 --> 16:38.243
Well, Henderson does want
to have drinks tonight.

16:38.244 --> 16:41.246
Okay, but this
is the last time.

16:41.247 --> 16:42.347
All right,
I need my ring back.

16:42.348 --> 16:44.782
Thank you, Riley.

16:44.783 --> 16:46.417
I'll buy you coffee and
we can work on our story.

16:46.418 --> 16:47.918
The one where you're a dork,
but I marry you anyway?

16:47.919 --> 16:50.187
( Chuckles )

16:50.188 --> 16:51.688
All right-- hand.
Thank you.

16:58.063 --> 16:59.663
Ooh...
( Flirtatious chuckle )

17:00.664 --> 17:02.264
What's up?

17:04.901 --> 17:06.867
- Tucker?
- Mrs. Wheeler?

17:07.637 --> 17:10.073
Oh, hell no!

17:10.074 --> 17:11.441
Oh no no no!

17:11.442 --> 17:12.340
- Oh yeah?
- Stop it!

17:12.342 --> 17:14.377
You gonna run
from me?

17:14.377 --> 17:16.377
- You're so fast!
- You're gonna run from me?!

17:17.680 --> 17:19.481
So now that I've
conquered New York,

17:19.482 --> 17:20.815
I'm taking the Henderson
brand national--

17:20.816 --> 17:23.185
Chicago, Atlanta,

17:23.185 --> 17:26.188
first stop Miami.
You ready for that, Wheeler?

17:26.189 --> 17:28.021
Wait, are you
offering me the job?

17:28.022 --> 17:30.525
Nothing's final,
but why don't you and Riles

17:30.526 --> 17:32.461
fly down for the weekend and check it out?
It'll be fun.

17:32.462 --> 17:34.360
Uh, this--
this weekend?

17:39.834 --> 17:42.136
You know what? I don't think
I can make it down to Miami.

17:42.137 --> 17:44.037
Are you sure about that?

17:44.038 --> 17:46.038
We all know how much
you like hotel rooms.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.509
Sounds like an offer we
can't refuse, huh, babe?

17:50.510 --> 17:52.645
Riley?

17:52.646 --> 17:54.847
I know this might not be the
best time to tell you this,

17:54.848 --> 17:57.617
but you need to hear it
and I need to say it.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.551
I'm in love with you and
I think we should be together.

18:02.055 --> 18:03.555
Please say something.

18:05.558 --> 18:08.193
Well, I guess the cat's
outta the bag.

18:08.194 --> 18:10.295
Ben, I am so sorry
to do this to you,

18:10.296 --> 18:11.930
but your brother
and I are in love.

18:11.931 --> 18:14.266
- We are?
- You are?

18:14.267 --> 18:16.335
I realize that Thanksgiving might
be a little awkward this year,

18:16.336 --> 18:18.237
but I'm hoping that in time
you'll come to accept it.

18:18.238 --> 18:20.272
You should really hire Ben.
The kid could use some good news.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.273
- All right, let's go, babe.
- Wait!

18:23.475 --> 18:25.909
Wow.

18:25.910 --> 18:29.113
Same thing happened
with me and my first wife.

18:29.114 --> 18:31.614
Only it was me walking out
the door with her sister.

18:33.685 --> 18:36.320
- Riley?
- ( Chuckles ) You were brilliant!

18:36.321 --> 18:37.854
"I'm in love with you"?
If this whole hockey thing doesn't work out,

18:37.855 --> 18:39.856
you should totally
be an actor.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.091
Because I swear for like two
seconds I actually believed you.

18:42.092 --> 18:44.294
- Riley--
- You are so sweet to come to my rescue.

18:44.295 --> 18:46.295
You promised you would
stop me and you did.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.264
Thank you.

18:48.265 --> 18:49.565
Mm.

18:53.703 --> 18:56.138
Well, guess that finally
answers the question

18:56.139 --> 18:58.139
of what it's like to be
married to Ben, huh?

19:02.145 --> 19:05.381
( Phone rings )

19:05.382 --> 19:08.883
Jack-- a guy who's
actually interested in me.

19:10.219 --> 19:12.620
Maybe I'll see
what that's like

19:12.621 --> 19:14.855
do you wanna come with?
Drinks are on me.

19:14.856 --> 19:16.591
No, I'm good.

19:17.092 --> 19:18.458
Okay. Thanks.

19:21.564 --> 19:23.763
Man, I gotta work
on my go time.

19:30.037 --> 19:32.037
- Where have you guys been?
- ( Door closes )

19:34.141 --> 19:35.674
Tell him.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.113
Fine. Ben, you are never gonna
believe what just happened.

19:40.114 --> 19:41.414
- All right!
- I--

19:43.684 --> 19:46.584
Ben, we need to return
the stroller.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.622
( Flatly ) We're being
immature and selfish

19:49.623 --> 19:51.257
and Emma deserves better.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.093
( Mouthing words )

19:54.094 --> 19:55.960
Can I go
to my room now?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.530
( Grumbling ) And
remember-- to your grave.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.336
Hey, Emma, Daddy really
missed you today.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.538
Ohh.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.305
Is everything okay?

20:08.306 --> 20:09.608
I got the job.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.843
( Gasps )
Oh, Benji!

20:11.844 --> 20:13.577
I just knew
you could do it.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.112
I turned it down.

20:15.113 --> 20:17.214
What is the matter
with you?!

20:17.215 --> 20:19.850
I couldn't do it.
It's too much travel.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.252
And what's the point
of giving Emma everything,

20:21.253 --> 20:24.255
if I'm not even here
to see her enjoy it?

20:24.256 --> 20:26.257
There will be other jobs,
but there's only one you.

20:26.758 --> 20:27.957
That we know of.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.361
But I think you made
the right decision.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.396
Thanks.

20:34.397 --> 20:35.732
So...

20:35.733 --> 20:38.401
What's the big secret
between you and Tucker?

20:38.402 --> 20:40.637
I was sitting outside
having coffee

20:40.638 --> 20:42.338
- and then Tucker comes up--
- That is not what happened!

20:42.339 --> 20:43.439
- No no, huh-uh.
- Oh, you didn't?

20:43.440 --> 20:44.374
You didn't go
"what's up"?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.007
No, I did not!

20:46.008 --> 20:46.742
Okay, I said,
"what's up?"

20:46.743 --> 20:48.043
( Indistinct arguing )

20:49.743 --> 20:51.043
That's right, Emma.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.451
Grandma is gonna get her princess
her special carriage back.

20:53.952 --> 20:55.518
Nice stroller.

20:55.519 --> 20:57.787
Hello...

20:57.788 --> 21:00.388
( Rock music playing )
