01:44.534 --> 01:47.598
- Need a hand?
- Um...

01:47.804 --> 01:50.237
yeah. Sure.

01:52.411 --> 01:53.767
Thanks.

01:54.179 --> 01:55.708
It's just through here.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.404
Hey. Hi, buddy.

02:00.118 --> 02:02.940
Hey, Dex.

02:02.952 --> 02:04.945
Boy, it's a hot one, huh?

02:05.287 --> 02:06.784
Yeah.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.419
Do you have fish?

02:08.425 --> 02:10.884
No. Take a closer look.

02:10.894 --> 02:13.456
Hey. Good boy.

02:14.098 --> 02:16.056
Stick insect.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.754
- Stick insect?
- They're actually very friendly.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.357
George.

02:24.075 --> 02:25.602
Mary.

02:27.011 --> 02:30.141
Want something to drink?
I think I got juice, maybe beer.

02:30.147 --> 02:33.072
Oh, no, I'm okay.
I'll just let you carry on.

02:33.082 --> 02:34.973
It's fine.

02:35.184 --> 02:37.279
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

02:37.284 --> 02:41.645
Hey, um, that stick insect?

02:41.656 --> 02:44.016
How do you know
it's being friendly?

02:45.429 --> 02:46.852
I have no idea.

02:53.069 --> 02:55.129
She loved you too.

02:58.105 --> 03:01.534
You let me go on
loving you, waiting.

03:01.544 --> 03:07.735
Also, why did you try
to kill something that can't ever die?

03:07.749 --> 03:09.845
I needed you then.

03:10.752 --> 03:14.507
I need you now.
I'll always need you.

03:19.761 --> 03:21.391
I knew it all the time.

03:21.397 --> 03:23.024
Hello?

03:26.034 --> 03:27.628
Hello?

03:28.335 --> 03:32.864
Is that 722-5795?

03:32.972 --> 03:35.034
- Yeah.
- Is Bobby there?

03:35.043 --> 03:39.267
No. I just moved in.
Maybe he had the apartment before?

03:47.755 --> 03:50.782
Mr. Davies,
anything you wish to add?

03:50.789 --> 03:53.761
Like I said, Your Honor, um...
my client feels a restraining order...

03:53.762 --> 03:56.263
to be an unjustified stain
on his character...

03:56.264 --> 03:58.203
and would like to have it lifted
at first opportunity.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.554
Noted.

04:02.235 --> 04:04.469
There's also the matter
of the family pet.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.946
I've made my position clear on that.

04:05.947 --> 04:07.405
But my client would like to know,
if there's any...

04:07.406 --> 04:10.639
Counselor, Miss Kee keeps the dog.

04:15.713 --> 04:16.934
Mr. Kirby.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.875
Your Honor, the divorce papers.

04:25.322 --> 04:27.380
Your Honor, there's been
an unforeseen delay.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.481
I will send them right over.

05:01.491 --> 05:02.676
You can't be here.

05:03.059 --> 05:05.817
Just wanted to drop them off myself.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.316
Figured it was the least I could do.

05:09.532 --> 05:11.958
Oh, there's the bad boy.

05:11.968 --> 05:13.655
Yes, it is.

05:14.471 --> 05:15.861
Daddy's home.

05:16.139 --> 05:19.132
Yes, he is. Yes, he is.

05:19.141 --> 05:20.770
You signed them?

05:27.884 --> 05:30.640
We had some good times,
didn't we?

06:03.050 --> 06:04.304
How about work?

06:04.318 --> 06:06.004
They're being understanding.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.309
You are going back, right?

06:08.322 --> 06:10.042
Not yet.

06:12.726 --> 06:14.982
Has he called again?

06:19.934 --> 06:23.293
How about going out,
meeting people?

06:27.075 --> 06:30.533
He said if he couldn't have you,
no one else would.

06:30.544 --> 06:34.905
You live like this,
in fear,

06:35.416 --> 06:37.499
he's won.

06:41.688 --> 06:43.249
Come here, come on.

06:45.025 --> 06:46.448
Come on, come on.

06:47.826 --> 06:49.216
Come on.

06:49.228 --> 06:50.757
Question nine:

06:50.765 --> 06:53.327
Edinburgh is the capital
of which country?

06:53.334 --> 06:55.257
Ireland.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.623
- Scotland?
- That's what I meant.

06:57.635 --> 06:59.891
Is the correct answer.

07:08.448 --> 07:09.805
Hello?

07:09.817 --> 07:11.877
May I speak with Bobby, please?

07:11.885 --> 07:14.104
There's no Bobby here.

07:14.118 --> 07:16.374
May I ask who you are?

07:16.655 --> 07:18.478
Who I am?

07:20.492 --> 07:22.449
Is this a joke?

07:22.726 --> 07:25.220
Did Steven put you up to this?

07:25.429 --> 07:27.754
Would you do me a favor, please?

07:27.766 --> 07:30.055
Tell him Rose called.

07:30.068 --> 07:33.290
I'll be in Frank's at 8
if he wants to see me.

07:33.639 --> 07:37.668
Rose, this friend of yours?
He really isn't here.

07:37.675 --> 07:41.294
And, you know, like I said,
I moved in a couple of days ago.

07:41.311 --> 07:44.501
I walked past the house last night.

07:44.516 --> 07:48.201
I saw him right there
in the window.

07:48.217 --> 07:52.909
- You have the right address?
- El Falansterio, L-2.

07:52.924 --> 07:55.781
Just tell him Frank's at 8, okay?

07:55.792 --> 07:57.978
Frank's at 8. Sure.

07:57.994 --> 08:02.288
If a guy called Bobby passes by,
I'll tell him whatever you want.

08:16.411 --> 08:19.099
Hello.
Hi.

08:34.828 --> 08:37.120
There are strict rules
in this college...

08:37.134 --> 08:41.991
about perpetuating age-
or gender-based stereotypes.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.491
Excuse me?

08:43.837 --> 08:46.867
It would be a breach of guidelines
for me to suggest...

08:46.875 --> 08:49.301
that you may have
mistakenly wandered...

08:49.311 --> 08:54.570
into Math for Stage Two Mechanical
Engineering here in 14-A...

08:54.583 --> 08:57.236
as opposed to, for example...

08:57.253 --> 08:59.245
Conversational French?

08:59.254 --> 09:01.008
In 14-B.

09:01.022 --> 09:07.418
Well, as it happens, I was wanting
to pursue a course on Math for...

09:07.429 --> 09:08.851
Stage Two Engineering.

09:10.363 --> 09:15.191
But having heard there's a course
on Conversational French...

09:15.603 --> 09:19.199
I hope you won't be too offended.
A little disappointed, maybe.

09:20.407 --> 09:22.092
Excuse me.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.145
What?

10:17.496 --> 10:18.717
You look tired.

10:35.479 --> 10:36.699
Hello?

10:36.713 --> 10:39.503
Bobby says he doesn't know you.

10:39.516 --> 10:41.739
Bobby's right.
You should listen to him.

10:41.753 --> 10:44.679
And while you're at it,
check his goddamn number.

10:44.689 --> 10:46.784
You think I'm mad at you,
don't you?

10:47.024 --> 10:50.212
But I'm not.
He's using you. It's what he does.

10:50.528 --> 10:54.996
Normally I like talking to crazy people,
but I'm kinda tired today.

10:54.997 --> 10:58.060
Wait, don't hang up, please.

10:59.236 --> 11:00.694
Please.

11:02.239 --> 11:07.064
Look, there's been a mistake,
a crossed line or something.

11:07.076 --> 11:09.263
He said he loved me.

11:20.956 --> 11:22.780
Rose?

11:24.993 --> 11:27.749
I'm sorry for what's happened.

11:28.064 --> 11:31.819
But your friend isn't here
and I don't know you.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.760
I'm so sorry.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.666
It's okay.

11:37.307 --> 11:39.197
No harm done.

11:42.444 --> 11:43.629
What's your name?

11:48.782 --> 11:50.673
Mary.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.607
Mary.

11:53.155 --> 11:54.751
Mary what?

11:55.123 --> 11:56.512
Mary Kee.

11:56.523 --> 11:59.678
He asked me to marry him.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.122
Lucky you.

12:03.464 --> 12:05.820
The day he got back from Vietnam.

12:06.700 --> 12:11.426
Came by in his uniform,
got down on one knee.

12:11.673 --> 12:15.131
Vietnam? You mean the war?

12:15.308 --> 12:18.769
Oh, he didn't wanna go.
He was drafted.

12:19.446 --> 12:21.304
How old are you?

12:21.681 --> 12:23.605
Forty-one.

12:26.352 --> 12:32.579
Rose, the Vietnam War was,
what, 35, 40 years ago?

12:32.592 --> 12:34.779
You would have been a child.

12:36.997 --> 12:39.924
Why are you doing this?

12:40.300 --> 12:44.021
Doing what?
What did I ever do to you?!

12:50.342 --> 12:53.962
We're sorry.
That number is unobtainable.

13:51.803 --> 13:55.693
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

13:55.704 --> 14:00.067
I wasn't thinking. I shouldn't have just...
Wait let me help you with that.

14:06.682 --> 14:09.472
- How was... how was French?
- I have to go.

14:09.584 --> 14:12.408
- I really didn't mean to scare you.
- I have to go.

14:27.037 --> 14:29.790
You trying to steal my job,
young lady?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.330
Do you do the weeding
around here?

14:32.342 --> 14:34.198
I sure do.

14:35.544 --> 14:37.195
What do you call this?

14:37.211 --> 14:38.773
Oversight.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.500
Pack up your desk, mister.
You're fired.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.202
Wow, you're a hard one.

14:43.218 --> 14:45.813
Knew that the first time
I laid my eyes on you.

14:45.819 --> 14:49.143
"Pack up your desk".

14:51.360 --> 14:52.818
Excuse me.

15:01.102 --> 15:03.594
- Hello?
- What's the date?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.061
This is harassment.

15:05.304 --> 15:09.768
September 4th, 1979.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.501
I can prove it.

15:11.513 --> 15:13.835
You know that big kitchen pantry?

15:13.847 --> 15:15.340
I'll draw something.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.534
Um...

15:16.550 --> 15:20.704
On the wall, just inside the door
on the right-hand side.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.645
And then if it's still there,
you'll know I'm right.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.252
Will you do that?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.688
Will you look?

15:27.696 --> 15:30.916
Sure, Rose.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.716
I'll look.

17:07.022 --> 17:10.117
- Hello?
- Was it there?

17:11.058 --> 17:13.212
It was, wasn't it?

17:13.229 --> 17:15.949
A picture. A rose.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.221
I knew it.

17:18.233 --> 17:21.489
- I wanna know what's going on.
- What do you mean?

17:21.502 --> 17:26.362
You knew the picture was there.
Maybe someone told you about it.

17:26.874 --> 17:29.845
- I don't know. I want the truth.
- I drew it.

17:29.846 --> 17:34.238
I did it last night like I said I would,
and it's still there.

17:34.247 --> 17:36.810
I don't believe you.

17:37.051 --> 17:39.704
But I'm supposed to believe you?

17:39.720 --> 17:44.284
You tell me you're from the future
and I believe you. I don't call you crazy.

17:44.291 --> 17:47.219
I give you proof
and you call me a liar.

17:47.229 --> 17:48.859
I'm not calling you a liar.

17:48.865 --> 17:52.187
This is happening for a reason.

17:57.738 --> 17:58.992
I gotta go.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.666
Not yet, please.

18:00.672 --> 18:02.928
There's things I need to ask you.

18:02.942 --> 18:06.006
Carter loses.
Reagan becomes president.

18:23.664 --> 18:25.350
Morning.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.056
Morning.

18:30.369 --> 18:32.260
They're beautiful.

18:37.141 --> 18:39.703
Thank you.
You're welcome.

18:43.683 --> 18:45.812
Oh, man.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.843
Did you know the people before me
in the apartment?

18:48.854 --> 18:50.574
A Spanish couple.

18:51.023 --> 18:54.209
Mr. and Mrs. Alvarez.
Nice people.

18:54.224 --> 18:58.596
You know Mrs. Alvarez, she would cook
this caldo gallego from time to time.

18:58.597 --> 19:01.585
To die for. Yeah.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.663
Why did they leave?

19:07.138 --> 19:09.927
I don't know.
I got up one day, they were gone.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.600
Guess some family stuff
or something. Not sure.

19:14.078 --> 19:15.729
I don't know.

19:17.149 --> 19:19.337
And the people before them?

19:19.953 --> 19:21.807
Before?

19:22.419 --> 19:25.106
I could hardly remember what
I had for breakfast.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.649
I don't know.

20:14.602 --> 20:17.129
Don't hang up, please.

20:17.137 --> 20:18.961
Please?

20:20.909 --> 20:24.699
Mary? Are you there?

20:25.279 --> 20:31.848
I just need someone to talk to.
I get so lonely. Please.

20:34.723 --> 20:39.323
You're so busy,
you can't spare five minutes?

20:44.263 --> 20:45.985
I'm here.

20:48.536 --> 20:51.722
Thank you for not hanging up.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.064
This is a little weird.

20:56.243 --> 20:58.736
Well, people come together
for a reason, Mary.

20:58.745 --> 21:01.102
It doesn't matter how.

21:01.314 --> 21:03.468
Do you believe that?

21:04.519 --> 21:07.738
I don't know. I suppose.

21:10.255 --> 21:12.852
- Why are you sad?
- I have to go now.

21:12.859 --> 21:14.489
Is it a man?

21:14.495 --> 21:17.147
- Did he cheat on you?
- No.

21:17.162 --> 21:20.385
Oh, don't be sad, Mary.
You sound like a smart lady.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.794
You'll find someone better,
someone who deserves you.

21:23.804 --> 21:27.560
Bobby cheats on me all the time.

21:28.441 --> 21:30.469
Why don't you leave him?

21:30.476 --> 21:31.866
I love him.

21:31.878 --> 21:33.801
So find a good substitute.

21:34.512 --> 21:36.141
Chocolate's good.

21:39.852 --> 21:42.242
He keeps promising he'll change.

21:42.254 --> 21:44.816
You've heard of feminism, yeah?
Women's lib?

21:44.823 --> 21:46.043
Yeah, of course.

21:46.058 --> 21:48.085
Jump on the bandwagon. It's a goer.

21:48.093 --> 21:51.225
Bobby doesn't like women's lib.

21:51.229 --> 21:54.723
He says they need a good smack.
MARY: He ever do that to you?

21:54.732 --> 21:56.625
Not really.

21:56.636 --> 21:58.561
Not really?

21:59.372 --> 22:01.728
He says he loves me.

22:01.740 --> 22:04.335
They don't change, Rose.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.527
Ever.

22:09.780 --> 22:12.842
Sometimes I think
I should have just got rid of him.

22:15.654 --> 22:19.717
Sometimes I think walking out
was the worst mistake I ever made.

23:35.097 --> 23:37.885
I took your advice.

23:38.632 --> 23:39.988
What?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.759
He... he laughed at me.

23:44.139 --> 23:47.928
I told him about you and me
and how he had to change

23:47.941 --> 23:51.834
and he just kept on laughing.

23:53.780 --> 23:58.104
I got rid of him, Mary,
just like you told me to.

23:58.116 --> 23:59.872
I worked all night.

23:59.887 --> 24:02.643
Real quiet
so the neighbors wouldn't hear.

24:02.657 --> 24:04.013
They'll never find him.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.985
They'll think he ran away
with one of his tramps.

24:06.994 --> 24:08.849
You killed him.

24:08.962 --> 24:11.649
I can move into
the apartment now.

24:11.665 --> 24:14.623
They don't care who pays the rent.

24:14.632 --> 24:19.255
I always hoped I'd live there
with Bobby someday, but...

24:21.541 --> 24:24.500
Mary, are you there?

24:26.278 --> 24:28.465
Don't ever call me, understand?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.872
I just did what you told me to do.
Don't ever call me again.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.307
Marie?

26:23.125 --> 26:24.811
Oh, God.

26:41.344 --> 26:43.336
How big is he?

26:44.679 --> 26:46.638
Bigger than you.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.902
Yeah, but I'm wiry.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.869
Be careful.

27:05.198 --> 27:08.329
Come here.
Why?

27:08.668 --> 27:10.491
Come here.

27:24.016 --> 27:26.236
That's not what I saw.

27:31.555 --> 27:33.345
How did you end up down here?

27:33.359 --> 27:36.683
Navy brat. My dad
was stationed at Roosey Roads.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.792
- It's just closed, right?
- Mm-hm.

27:40.799 --> 27:41.984
You?

27:43.502 --> 27:46.392
My grandparents came over
from Turin.

27:46.603 --> 27:50.600
I was born here, but I went to school
in Florida. Gainesville.

27:51.842 --> 27:54.234
Taught there for a while.

27:54.478 --> 27:57.404
And then I saw the opening
at the college.

28:01.819 --> 28:03.972
Don't get many Italians
in San Juan.

28:03.988 --> 28:07.210
By the time my grandfather
realized this wasn't New York,

28:07.224 --> 28:10.618
the boat had already sailed.
That's not true.

28:11.329 --> 28:13.980
Ma, that true about Pappy?

28:13.997 --> 28:16.422
Idiot got on the wrong boat.

28:18.334 --> 28:20.430
Thank you very much, Mrs. Guidi.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.533
I like this one.

28:23.672 --> 28:26.063
Does he, uh,
bring girls around often?

28:26.074 --> 28:27.968
One time before.
Ma.

28:27.979 --> 28:30.507
She asked, I'm gonna tell.

28:30.515 --> 28:33.838
A girl called Trulli.
Trudy, Trudy.

28:34.350 --> 28:36.707
That girl could eat like a horse.
Ma.

28:36.719 --> 28:40.838
Giovanni, that girl Johnny
brought home, what did she eat?

28:42.156 --> 28:43.546
Let's see.

28:43.558 --> 28:47.817
Caesar salad, roast beef,
french fries, carrots,

28:47.831 --> 28:51.325
minced peas, three pieces of
bread and butter and a tiramisu.

28:54.369 --> 28:55.827
What happened to Trudy?

28:55.838 --> 28:57.797
She exploded.

28:58.339 --> 29:01.129
Would you like something else?
No, thank you.

29:01.142 --> 29:04.104
We should be...
We should be going.

29:07.482 --> 29:09.042
Mm-mm.

29:10.452 --> 29:13.946
Hey, see you, Pop.
Nice meeting you, Mary.

29:14.255 --> 29:16.543
Good night.
Bye-bye.

29:23.899 --> 29:26.495
It's not where
I pictured you.

29:26.535 --> 29:28.994
I needed a place in a hurry.

29:29.837 --> 29:31.831
It's not so bad.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.695
The apartments are really big.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.269
Thanks for tonight.

29:38.813 --> 29:40.533
You're welcome.

29:50.424 --> 29:52.051
Good night.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.716
Good night.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.707
Whose jacket?
How did you get in here?

30:26.723 --> 30:30.184
How many times I told you?
Can't go leaving the back door open.

30:30.193 --> 30:32.621
Lucky it was me.
Could've been anyone.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.889
I'm calling the police.

30:37.534 --> 30:38.959
Go ahead.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.728
If you wanna make me angry.

30:41.739 --> 30:44.027
Neither one of us wants that.

30:44.041 --> 30:47.569
All these lawyers.
We haven't had a chance to talk.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.205
You can't be here.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.543
Not within 500 feet of me.

30:54.685 --> 30:56.610
Five hundred feet.

30:59.089 --> 31:01.579
Come on.
It's kinda ridiculous, isn't it?

31:03.159 --> 31:05.051
What do you want?

31:08.499 --> 31:10.594
I miss you, Mary.

31:11.268 --> 31:17.561
I mean, the way we were,
the fun we used to have.

31:17.941 --> 31:20.296
Remember? So I just said,

31:20.308 --> 31:25.533
"Screw the judges. Screw the lawyers.
They don't know us".

31:27.284 --> 31:29.504
I just came to talk.

31:30.819 --> 31:32.846
The way we used to.

31:34.790 --> 31:36.510
Remember?

31:42.300 --> 31:44.395
Don't answer it.

31:44.401 --> 31:46.051
Mary.

31:47.603 --> 31:48.855
I forgot my jacket.

32:03.119 --> 32:05.145
I didn't mean to intrude.

32:09.591 --> 32:11.846
Excuse my manners.

32:13.092 --> 32:16.884
- John Guidi.
- Hey, Steven. Nice to meet you.

32:16.999 --> 32:19.287
Um, excuse me.

32:19.434 --> 32:22.086
You wanna tell your friend
you're busy?

32:22.102 --> 32:25.165
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you busy?

32:27.341 --> 32:29.061
Not really.

32:29.076 --> 32:30.932
Not really.

32:40.921 --> 32:42.378
I'll be in touch.

32:52.030 --> 32:54.890
You need to get
the air conditioning fixed.

32:55.469 --> 32:58.063
Tell that to my building manager.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.968
I could take a look at it
some time if you want.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.294
Thanks.

33:09.980 --> 33:14.018
You should call the police. I mean you do
have a restraining order on the guy.

33:14.019 --> 33:16.240
It wouldn't make a difference.

33:16.922 --> 33:19.018
Only makes him mad.

33:20.192 --> 33:22.413
Mary, listen, I can...
I can handle it.

33:23.994 --> 33:25.680
Thanks.

33:30.069 --> 33:32.165
I'll check that lock.

33:44.114 --> 33:45.972
That should do it.

33:48.887 --> 33:50.277
Gonna be okay?

33:50.921 --> 33:53.608
I'll be fine.
All right.

34:05.035 --> 34:06.755
In case you need anything.

34:06.771 --> 34:09.730
Thanks. Again.

34:20.215 --> 34:21.744
Hello?

34:21.752 --> 34:24.974
- Hi. Is that Luillo?
- Yes.

34:25.523 --> 34:29.083
It's Mary Kee.
I'm calling from apart...

34:29.358 --> 34:31.918
- Hello?
- I'm here.

34:32.194 --> 34:35.016
I'm calling about
the air conditioning.

34:35.630 --> 34:38.125
I can't hear you. Hel...?

34:38.634 --> 34:40.161
Hello?

35:03.824 --> 35:05.716
- Hello.
- Luillo?

35:05.726 --> 35:07.753
- Yes?
- Hi, it's Mary.

35:07.762 --> 35:10.323
You're calling about...
The air conditioning.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.257
- What's wrong?
- It's been broken since I moved in.

35:13.267 --> 35:15.625
It's something I can fix in...

35:15.637 --> 35:17.357
That long?

35:17.639 --> 35:19.528
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be calling.

35:19.539 --> 35:22.727
I'll wait for your call. Thank you.
Bye.

35:32.386 --> 35:34.140
I told you to stop calling me.

35:34.155 --> 35:35.340
What happened?

35:35.356 --> 35:36.611
Are you okay?
Hi, Mom.

35:36.625 --> 35:40.414
No, it's not Steven. It's just a crank.

35:58.277 --> 36:01.271
No trouble?
No, she's sweet, a really nice girl.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.274
She's a little bit down today.

36:05.851 --> 36:07.343
Hey.

36:07.352 --> 36:10.212
Your buddy John?
Great job fixing my lawn mower.

36:10.223 --> 36:11.724
It's just a couple wires.

36:11.725 --> 36:15.115
I'll tell you, he handled that
engine like a nervous lover.

36:16.995 --> 36:19.455
It was really just...
A feather touch.

36:19.464 --> 36:21.992
Hey, can I offer
you guys a soda?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.650
Um, I gotta go.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.023
So soon?

36:25.035 --> 36:26.222
It was...

36:26.705 --> 36:30.233
I really just came by to make sure
that you were okay.

36:32.744 --> 36:34.896
- Everything's fine.
- Bye.

36:34.913 --> 36:36.973
- Bye, George.
- Okay.

36:38.449 --> 36:40.668
I will call you.

36:41.217 --> 36:42.607
We should do something.

36:43.822 --> 36:45.382
Okay.

36:47.991 --> 36:49.245
Feather touch.

36:54.331 --> 36:56.392
You're a wicked man, George.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.720
That I am.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.741
Hello?

37:18.755 --> 37:20.316
I know you've been avoiding me.

37:20.324 --> 37:22.420
But that's going to stop now.
I told you...

37:22.426 --> 37:24.316
I saw you and your mommy today

37:24.326 --> 37:26.889
posing for photos
outside the cathedral.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.492
When I call,
you're going to answer.

37:29.498 --> 37:34.186
I wanna keep you safe, Mary,
you and your beautiful mother.

37:44.612 --> 37:46.139
Shit.

38:56.081 --> 38:57.538
Can I ask you something?

39:00.152 --> 39:01.645
Sure.

39:01.653 --> 39:03.611
Who won the World Series in '79?

39:04.188 --> 39:07.049
Pirates beat the Baltimore Orioles.

39:07.061 --> 39:09.623
Pirates were down
a three-game-to-one deficit.

39:09.630 --> 39:11.985
They won it in seven games, yeah.

39:12.398 --> 39:14.458
- Is that right?
- Yeah, look it up.

39:14.466 --> 39:16.720
Clemente would've been
proud of that.

39:16.734 --> 39:20.023
And that same year,
the year the Pirates beat the Orioles,

39:20.036 --> 39:21.995
who lived in my apartment?

39:25.410 --> 39:26.833
What is this about?

39:27.279 --> 39:30.307
You said you can't remember
what you had for breakfast.

39:30.314 --> 39:32.410
I think you remember just fine.

39:34.685 --> 39:37.906
Rose. Rose Lazar.

39:38.788 --> 39:40.110
You knew her.

39:42.027 --> 39:45.952
She said, "Good morning".
You know, things like that, yeah.

39:46.696 --> 39:48.086
And?

39:50.266 --> 39:52.760
You know, she was the sad type.

39:53.703 --> 39:56.730
She had a boyfriend
who worked over at the Army base.

39:56.737 --> 39:58.835
They were together for a while.

39:58.843 --> 40:01.495
From time to time,
they'd be fighting.

40:02.112 --> 40:04.503
Come home around midnight,

40:04.514 --> 40:06.837
they'd be hollering
and banging doors.

40:06.850 --> 40:09.879
One day, the guy just disappeared.

40:11.454 --> 40:13.741
That's when she moved in.

40:13.888 --> 40:15.642
What happened to her?

40:18.194 --> 40:21.017
Killed herself.
Here?

40:21.230 --> 40:26.284
She wrapped the phone cord around her neck,
hung herself from the ceiling.

40:27.603 --> 40:29.289
Do you know why she did it?

40:29.304 --> 40:31.524
Like I said, she...

40:32.406 --> 40:35.164
she was the sad type.

40:53.530 --> 40:56.217
Are you sure she's dead?

40:56.931 --> 41:01.188
That's what I was told,
but there's no death certificate.

41:02.104 --> 41:04.234
Sorry, I can't help you.

41:06.572 --> 41:08.429
It's Steven. It has to be.

41:08.440 --> 41:13.004
How? How would he build a wall
without my noticing? A wall.

41:13.614 --> 41:15.970
And how would he know
about Rose?

41:15.982 --> 41:18.976
He set it up.
He must have done it.

41:18.985 --> 41:21.581
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

41:21.954 --> 41:24.674
You're talking to a Trekkie.
I can handle it.

41:27.595 --> 41:28.951
All right.

41:29.697 --> 41:31.826
Let's say that you're right.

41:33.766 --> 41:36.658
You talked to this woman
a few weeks ago

41:36.669 --> 41:39.800
and then she put something
in your pantry.

41:40.139 --> 41:42.768
- A body.
- A body.

41:42.774 --> 41:46.739
But according to
your time-jump theory,

41:46.747 --> 41:49.933
she doesn't do it a few weeks ago,
she does it in 1979.

41:50.783 --> 41:54.244
When you moved in, the pantry
would already be bricked up.

41:54.253 --> 41:57.476
- But it wasn't.
- Exactly, so it doesn't work.

42:01.491 --> 42:05.989
Unless you're remembering
the past as it was

42:05.999 --> 42:07.991
before it changed.

42:10.836 --> 42:12.225
This is time

42:13.571 --> 42:14.961
like a river.

42:15.239 --> 42:17.265
And this is something
that happens.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.960
An event.

42:18.976 --> 42:24.135
Which affects the way the river flows.
Right.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.744
So if you follow this path,

42:26.984 --> 42:32.379
he ends up leaving
and she hangs herself.

42:33.724 --> 42:36.183
What if something
interferes with that?

42:36.192 --> 42:38.654
She makes a new friend, say.

42:40.032 --> 42:42.491
- Hello.
- Is Bobby there?

42:43.734 --> 42:45.488
We get a whole different path.

42:46.970 --> 42:50.329
The boyfriend ends up dead
and you lose your pantry.

42:53.976 --> 42:56.300
Right, but why...?

42:56.313 --> 42:59.103
- why did you remember the pantry?
- Right.

42:59.149 --> 43:02.211
You remember it
because you caused it to change.

43:02.218 --> 43:07.317
And somehow it leaves a trace,
like a pencil drawing a line, so...

43:13.128 --> 43:14.350
You erase it...

43:15.132 --> 43:17.193
and you draw another line.

43:17.834 --> 43:20.792
But you can still see
where the first one was.

43:22.103 --> 43:23.891
But only you.

43:23.905 --> 43:26.695
Only the person that erased it.

43:38.019 --> 43:41.480
- You really think that's it?
- Honestly, no.

43:41.623 --> 43:43.514
I think we pull down that wall,

43:43.525 --> 43:47.247
there's some sick surprise from Steven
and he's fucking with you.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.117
I'm not touching that wall.

43:49.464 --> 43:51.959
What? You're just gonna
leave it there?

43:51.967 --> 43:54.721
Really? Come on, really?

43:55.469 --> 43:59.294
You're gonna go to bed wondering
if there is a corpse in your kitchen?

43:59.306 --> 44:01.265
I'm not touching it.

44:56.494 --> 44:59.681
Can we get the bear?
No, I don't want the hat.

45:33.829 --> 45:36.860
I still can't believe you lost my hat.

45:36.867 --> 45:38.997
I loved that hat.

45:56.787 --> 45:58.539
Stay there.

46:07.428 --> 46:09.751
John, is that you?

47:01.047 --> 47:02.868
Hey, buddy.

47:22.033 --> 47:23.687
Hello?

47:26.939 --> 47:28.693
Who's there?

49:00.162 --> 49:03.623
Which fictional family
lives at 742 Evergreen Terrace?

49:03.633 --> 49:05.886
Repeat the question, please.

49:05.899 --> 49:08.028
742 Evergreen Terrace.

49:08.034 --> 49:10.689
Which fictional family lives
at that address?

49:10.705 --> 49:12.961
Simpsons.

49:12.975 --> 49:14.797
I'm gonna pass.

49:14.809 --> 49:19.500
You were right to pass.
The correct answer is the Simpsons.

49:19.515 --> 49:21.041
Question six.

49:21.049 --> 49:24.543
Worcestershire sauce contains two
of the following ingredients.

49:24.551 --> 49:27.480
Which ingredient
does it not contain?

49:27.491 --> 49:30.985
Molasses, anchovies, mustard.

49:30.993 --> 49:33.849
- Mustard.
- Mustard?

49:33.861 --> 49:35.548
Is the correct answer.

50:05.893 --> 50:08.386
ROSE:
Did I wake you?

50:09.462 --> 50:13.025
You're not gonna hang up
on me now, are you?

50:13.032 --> 50:16.094
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna talk to me?

50:16.101 --> 50:18.925
We're friends, aren't we?

50:20.240 --> 50:24.428
Don't want anything to happen
to that charming mother of yours.

50:27.179 --> 50:30.401
You out late last night?
What's his name?

50:30.414 --> 50:32.704
John.
John what?

50:32.718 --> 50:36.371
John Guidi.
Guidi.

50:36.387 --> 50:40.715
Sure, his parents run the little diner
on San Francisco.

50:43.295 --> 50:45.550
I saw you yesterday.

50:45.931 --> 50:47.458
What?

50:47.466 --> 50:49.562
In a nursing home.

50:52.302 --> 50:54.329
I don't understand.

50:54.337 --> 50:57.059
I found you through
social services.

50:57.074 --> 51:01.264
Is something wrong with me?
Am I sick?

51:01.946 --> 51:03.235
Not physically.

51:04.148 --> 51:06.575
A little thin, maybe.

51:06.585 --> 51:08.407
You don't eat.

51:09.419 --> 51:12.549
Mentally, though...
Tell me.

51:12.555 --> 51:17.349
What do you think?
All that anger, all that rage.

51:17.694 --> 51:19.824
You didn't think it would
affect you?

51:19.829 --> 51:22.619
You're lying.
Think about it, Rose.

51:22.632 --> 51:25.285
Ever wonder why
you don't have any friends?

51:25.301 --> 51:28.487
Why you're stalking someone
you never even met?

51:28.503 --> 51:30.566
You think that's normal?
Shut up.

51:30.573 --> 51:33.705
What about Bobby, all the times
he screwed around on you?

51:33.711 --> 51:35.806
All the times
he walked out on you?

51:35.812 --> 51:38.306
He never walked out on me.
Who told you that?

51:38.314 --> 51:41.308
It doesn't matter.
Who have you been talking to?

51:41.317 --> 51:44.107
Who's been telling tales?
It's not important.

51:44.120 --> 51:48.011
What's important
is that you can change this.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.814
You don't have to end up
in a nuthouse.

51:50.827 --> 51:53.479
You can stop this happening.

52:00.068 --> 52:03.391
You spoke to me?

52:06.339 --> 52:08.563
You don't talk much.

52:09.512 --> 52:11.798
I stayed a little while,

52:12.614 --> 52:17.269
watched some TV, played cards.

52:17.685 --> 52:20.110
Said I'd come visit again today.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.444
I don't play cards, never have.

52:23.456 --> 52:26.214
Well, I guess you learned.

52:26.228 --> 52:29.881
Not well, either.
I beat you every time.

52:30.330 --> 52:33.587
You think this is funny.

52:33.601 --> 52:36.755
You think this is fucking funny?

52:36.771 --> 52:39.866
A sad, pathetic woman in diapers
who can't feed herself?

52:39.872 --> 52:41.901
No, Rose, I don't think it's funny.

52:41.910 --> 52:45.939
But it doesn't have to be this way.
It's your choice.

52:55.921 --> 52:57.779
All right.

53:00.061 --> 53:01.315
That should do it.

53:13.071 --> 53:15.428
That is so good.

53:28.487 --> 53:30.707
Do you know why
they call them daisies?

53:30.721 --> 53:32.680
No.

53:32.689 --> 53:34.978
It's from "day's eye".

53:35.327 --> 53:37.650
Because they open their petals
in the sun.

53:37.663 --> 53:40.793
You know what I call them?
Weeds.

53:40.798 --> 53:43.258
No, you don't.
Sure, I do.

53:43.268 --> 53:45.659
No, you like them.

53:45.671 --> 53:49.029
You think they're pretty.
Is that so?

53:51.775 --> 53:53.703
There you go.

54:13.164 --> 54:16.365
Did you visit me again today?
You said you would.

54:16.366 --> 54:17.827
Just got back.

54:18.869 --> 54:21.932
We play cards?
A little.

54:21.939 --> 54:25.557
How did I look?
A little better.

54:25.573 --> 54:28.934
More color, maybe.
That all? Nothing else about me?

54:28.947 --> 54:32.942
Nothing unusual?
I'm really not sure.

54:32.949 --> 54:35.544
Think real hard.

54:38.186 --> 54:40.374
I'm really not sure.

54:40.389 --> 54:43.018
Okay, Mary.

54:43.024 --> 54:46.018
I'm going to bury something
next to the palm tree

54:46.027 --> 54:49.023
a couple of feet out
towards the apartment.

54:49.032 --> 54:53.925
You go dig it up. You understand?
Dig it up.

55:30.205 --> 55:32.061
ROSE:
You lied.

55:32.072 --> 55:35.361
You didn't find me in
a nursing home, did you, Mary?

55:35.375 --> 55:38.131
You didn't find me at all.

55:38.178 --> 55:41.037
Because if you had,
you'd have known what to say:

55:41.049 --> 55:44.371
"Yes, Rose, you did look different.

55:44.384 --> 55:48.176
You looked a whole lot different".

56:14.779 --> 56:16.968
It's not real. It can't be real.

56:23.989 --> 56:26.449
That is fucked.

56:33.467 --> 56:35.220
Great.

56:42.273 --> 56:44.460
Let me.
No.

56:44.810 --> 56:46.596
Trust me.

56:54.152 --> 56:55.746
Hello?

56:56.619 --> 56:58.306
ROSE:
Who's this?

56:58.322 --> 57:00.281
Name's John. Who's this?

57:00.558 --> 57:04.813
John Guidi, Mary's little friend.

57:05.260 --> 57:09.588
I know your parents, John Guidi.
That's nice.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.752
Put her on.

57:11.769 --> 57:14.125
I think me and you
should talk first.

57:14.137 --> 57:16.767
I said, put her on.

57:16.773 --> 57:19.631
She doesn't wanna speak
to you right now.

57:20.343 --> 57:22.938
Did she find my gift?

57:23.645 --> 57:25.536
Yeah.

57:26.217 --> 57:29.576
I gotta say, I think that's pretty
screwed-up, don't you?

57:29.887 --> 57:32.914
I've got another little surprise.

57:32.955 --> 57:36.382
Tell her I guessed
who the tattletale was.

57:36.391 --> 57:37.952
What?

57:38.626 --> 57:42.519
Tattletale tit
Your tongue shall be split

57:42.530 --> 57:46.960
And every little puppy dog
Shall eat a little bit

57:48.637 --> 57:52.929
You know, Rose, I don't think
you should call here anymore.

57:52.941 --> 57:56.005
This whole thing has gone too far.

57:56.012 --> 57:57.831
Just tell hen

58:02.684 --> 58:05.939
Well, that's one seriously nutty lady.
What did she say?

58:05.952 --> 58:08.582
Something about
a tattletale.

58:09.557 --> 58:13.120
Said she guessed who it was.
What?

58:15.862 --> 58:18.390
George. George.

58:19.032 --> 58:21.630
Where's George?
Excuse me?

58:21.637 --> 58:23.232
This is his apartment.

58:24.137 --> 58:25.392
No.

58:25.406 --> 58:28.662
I just saw him this evening.
I made him a daisy chain.

58:30.745 --> 58:34.102
I hope you don't mind me asking,
how long have you been here?

58:34.113 --> 58:35.799
A few months,
since the baby.

58:35.814 --> 58:38.879
And before that?
Do you know who was here before?

58:38.886 --> 58:42.380
Older couple,
Dominican, I think.

58:44.824 --> 58:48.683
Sorry to have disturbed you.
Thank you.

58:54.132 --> 58:55.887
You remember George.

58:57.871 --> 59:02.093
George. You met him.

59:02.107 --> 59:03.531
You made jokes.

59:03.542 --> 59:06.798
You fixed his lawn mower,
for chrissakes.

59:09.948 --> 59:11.771
I never met him, Mary.

59:13.820 --> 59:16.882
You think I'm crazy.

59:17.854 --> 59:20.144
I think we should go inside.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.361
Maybe it would be a good idea
for you not to be here tonight.

59:33.372 --> 59:35.796
I'm not crazy.

59:35.806 --> 59:39.234
You've been under a lot of pressure
with Steven and the phone.

59:39.244 --> 59:42.638
Maybe you could go to your mom's.
You could stay at mine.

59:42.648 --> 59:45.834
This isn't...
It wouldn't...

59:47.316 --> 59:51.848
I'd stay on the couch
and you could get some sleep.

59:51.856 --> 59:54.985
And see how you feel
in the morning.

01:00:07.005 --> 01:00:08.930
- Through here.
- Thanks.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.364
Hey, it's okay, Dex.

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.062
Keep going.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.485
Maybe you should move out.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:37.549
- I've only just moved in.
- This woman is crazy.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.664
Whoever she is,
wherever she's calling from,

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:46.291
if you move out, maybe it'll stop.
Maybe that's what she wants.

01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:48.795
So now you don't think
it's Steven?

01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:51.372
I don't know who it is,

01:00:51.379 --> 01:00:54.702
but if it were me,
I would be out of there.

01:00:58.085 --> 01:01:00.308
I should go to bed.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.748
Leave this.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.749
There are fresh towels on the bed.

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.950
Thanks.

01:03:33.902 --> 01:03:35.553
Mary!

01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:38.859
What's wrong?

01:03:39.709 --> 01:03:41.770
What?

01:03:41.778 --> 01:03:43.461
Nothing.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.670
Nothing, I'm fine. Go back to sleep.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:11.093
Morning.
Hey. Hey, Dex.

01:04:12.605 --> 01:04:14.029
Coffee?

01:04:14.039 --> 01:04:16.832
Yeah,
that sounds great.

01:04:16.845 --> 01:04:19.269
Have you decided
what you're gonna do?

01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:21.539
Um...

01:04:22.616 --> 01:04:25.372
I think I'm gonna
take Dexter for a walk.

01:04:26.286 --> 01:04:27.676
And then?

01:04:32.593 --> 01:04:36.451
And then I'm gonna go back
to the apartment,

01:04:36.462 --> 01:04:38.888
pick up my things

01:04:39.765 --> 01:04:42.156
and make the dreaded call
to Mom.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.021
I think that's right.

01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:11.384
Hey, Dex. Hey.

01:05:13.264 --> 01:05:16.293
You wanna go for a run? Yeah?

01:05:16.301 --> 01:05:17.930
Go on.

01:05:39.855 --> 01:05:42.078
Let him go, Steven.

01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:46.854
Come on, Dex.
Come on, Dexter.

01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:50.660
Come on, Dex. Come on.

01:05:50.668 --> 01:05:52.592
So are you
sleeping with him now?

01:05:54.237 --> 01:05:56.695
That new friend of yours?

01:05:57.839 --> 01:06:03.442
Dexter. Come to Mommy, Dexter.
That's a good boy. Come on.

01:06:04.948 --> 01:06:07.008
I don't think it's really fair.

01:06:07.516 --> 01:06:09.976
He gets to share my dog.

01:06:16.524 --> 01:06:18.781
Come on, Dex.
We're leaving.

01:06:22.733 --> 01:06:24.861
He doesn't get
to share my dog.

01:06:25.433 --> 01:06:26.857
You understand?

01:06:27.502 --> 01:06:28.687
Hm?

01:06:50.123 --> 01:06:53.082
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm finishing at 3.

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:56.248
And you wanna meet up after class?
Yeah.

01:06:56.264 --> 01:06:58.223
Meet you out front.
Sounds great.

01:06:58.233 --> 01:07:01.157
All right. Okay, bye.
Bye.

01:07:21.688 --> 01:07:25.478
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

01:07:43.773 --> 01:07:46.643
- I'm looking for John.
- Ah, I'll call him.

01:07:53.085 --> 01:07:56.443
I'm sorry, Mr. Guidi.
I'm actually looking for John Jr.

01:07:56.454 --> 01:07:58.585
I tried his cell-phone,
it doesn't seem to be working.

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:02.243
- John Jr.?
- I was supposed to meet him.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.553
I only wanna talk to him.

01:08:10.568 --> 01:08:12.720
You wanna talk to my son?

01:08:14.539 --> 01:08:17.066
- I don't understand.
- I'll tell you.

01:08:17.475 --> 01:08:20.627
Santa Margarita, south entrance.

01:08:20.643 --> 01:08:23.741
That's where I go
when I want to talk to him.

01:09:31.912 --> 01:09:33.370
WOMAN:
You knew him?

01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:42.946
I see his mother
from time to time.

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:46.243
She comes here a lot.

01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:51.582
My husband, Charlie,

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:54.922
prick that he was.

01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:01.826
You know anything about the boy?
How he died?

01:10:02.141 --> 01:10:05.705
They don't know he died.
They were never sure.

01:10:08.381 --> 01:10:10.637
They never found him.

01:12:17.973 --> 01:12:23.004
Bobby Shafto went to sea
Silver buckles...

01:12:23.011 --> 01:12:25.368
You were supposed to kill yourself.

01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:29.669
George found you here
in the kitchen.

01:12:29.683 --> 01:12:32.248
You'd started to smell.

01:12:32.888 --> 01:12:36.642
This was your fault, Mary. All of it.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:38.616
He was gonna take you away
from me.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:40.948
You were gonna let him.

01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:44.990
I'm willing to forgive, start over.

01:12:44.998 --> 01:12:48.153
You'll never be happy, Rose.
We both know that.

01:12:48.168 --> 01:12:51.596
So why put up with it?
A few pills, that's all it would take.

01:12:51.606 --> 01:12:54.929
But I am happy.

01:12:54.942 --> 01:12:58.266
I have a friend here with me.

01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:03.503
GIRL:
Hello?

01:13:05.017 --> 01:13:06.202
Who's this?

01:13:06.218 --> 01:13:09.817
GIRL:
Mary. Mary Kee.

01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:14.210
You're lying.
GIRL: No, I'm not.

01:13:16.262 --> 01:13:18.119
Where do you live?

01:13:18.131 --> 01:13:20.817
GIRL:
Roosey Roads.

01:13:21.133 --> 01:13:25.359
Rose says
you're one of her best friends.

01:13:25.373 --> 01:13:30.162
Says I'm one
of her best friends too.

01:13:30.175 --> 01:13:32.565
Mary, listen.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:36.539
You need to go home now.
Understand?

01:13:36.548 --> 01:13:40.770
ROSE:
Hello, Mary. Recognize the voice?

01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:44.282
You should. It's yours.

01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.785
What are you doing with her,
you crazy bitch?

01:13:46.793 --> 01:13:49.423
We're making dinner, Mary.

01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:53.787
Surely you remember.
We're frying chicken.

01:13:53.798 --> 01:13:57.418
But we have to be careful, don't we,
because oil is hot.

01:13:57.435 --> 01:14:00.123
Oil gets very hot.

01:14:00.139 --> 01:14:05.498
We have to be very, very careful,
don't we, Mary?

01:14:05.843 --> 01:14:08.667
Yes, please be careful.
What was that?

01:14:08.913 --> 01:14:10.974
Please be careful.

01:14:11.549 --> 01:14:13.508
You were mean to me, Mary.

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:17.409
You were gonna let that man
take you away from me.

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:22.747
I'm sorry, Rose.
You don't sound sorry.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.547
I really am.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:28.682
You sound scared,
but you don't sound sorry.

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.021
I'm really, really sorry.
One more time.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:34.688
One more time and we'll see
if you sound like you mean it.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.027
I'm really sorry, Rose.

01:14:38.776 --> 01:14:40.871
I don't think so.

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:45.033
Please. Please, Rose. Please.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:50.303
No! Stop it, please!

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:56.148
Please, stop, Rose, please!
Stop! Stop!

01:15:16.644 --> 01:15:18.034
No!

01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:11.022
- Rose?
- Yes, Mary.

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:15.089
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.957
You?

01:16:18.504 --> 01:16:20.256
I was.

01:16:21.339 --> 01:16:24.836
You see why I did it now,
don't you?

01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:27.997
All I ever wanted
was to be your friend.

01:16:29.014 --> 01:16:32.043
Don't ever leave me, Mary.

01:16:40.025 --> 01:16:43.645
- It's my birthday tomorrow.
- Congratulations.

01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:46.587
- What have you got planned?
- Nothing.

01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:49.953
I remember it back then.

01:16:49.968 --> 01:16:51.961
It was horrible.

01:16:52.503 --> 01:16:54.427
Yeah?

01:16:54.438 --> 01:16:58.766
I had a party
at the bowling alley on the base.

01:17:02.179 --> 01:17:03.809
Nobody came.

01:17:07.317 --> 01:17:09.947
They were scared of how I looked.

01:17:11.254 --> 01:17:15.113
I was so sad and lonely.

01:17:21.464 --> 01:17:23.219
Maybe you could come, Rose.

01:17:24.434 --> 01:17:26.325
I'd like that.

01:17:26.336 --> 01:17:31.297
It would be just like we were friends.
I'd look after you.

01:17:31.673 --> 01:17:33.703
I know that now.

01:17:35.747 --> 01:17:39.775
We got there around 3:00.
Maybe a bit after.

01:17:39.782 --> 01:17:42.674
I'll be there at 3.
I'll hold a lane for you.

01:17:42.685 --> 01:17:47.044
Thank you, Rose.
What are friends for?

01:19:22.615 --> 01:19:24.766
Hello?
WOMAN: Oh, hi, honey.

01:19:24.783 --> 01:19:26.344
Hi, Mom.

01:19:26.351 --> 01:19:28.810
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.848
How's Dexter?

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:35.151
Good, okay.

01:19:35.693 --> 01:19:40.818
Love you.
Yeah, love you. Bye.

01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:52.233
Mom, I told you...
ROSE: Hello, Mary.

01:19:53.543 --> 01:19:57.199
I missed the bus.
I didn't make it to the bowling alley.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:20:00.004
Lucky in a way, though, wasn't it?

01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:02.078
- Rose, I didn't...
- Hello?

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.705
Hello?

01:20:03.721 --> 01:20:08.715
Mary, I need you to go home, okay?
Can you do that? As quick as you can.

01:20:08.723 --> 01:20:11.410
Just put the phone down,
run as fast as you can.

01:20:11.427 --> 01:20:13.423
ROSE:
Not such a bad kid, is she?

01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:17.919
What happened, Mary? What made her
turn into such a bitch?

01:20:18.902 --> 01:20:20.588
Don't hurt her, Rose.

01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:24.740
- Please, don't hurt her.
Like you tried to hurt me?

01:20:24.741 --> 01:20:27.308
- Like you tried to kill me?
- Rose, I...

01:20:27.309 --> 01:20:31.132
Only she wouldn't understand, would she?
She wouldn't think it was fair.

01:20:31.148 --> 01:20:34.973
You'd understand, though,
wouldn't you, Mary?

01:20:35.484 --> 01:20:36.669
Please.

01:20:37.985 --> 01:20:39.945
Please.

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:42.813
Rose?

01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:46.786
I best let you go now.
You have things to do.

01:20:46.794 --> 01:20:48.797
No, I... I have time.

01:20:48.798 --> 01:20:51.956
Not today, Mary.
You have a visitor.

01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:54.622
Leave me alone!

01:22:49.947 --> 01:22:53.806
YOUNG MARY:
Hello? Hello?

01:22:56.186 --> 01:22:57.815
Mary?

01:22:57.821 --> 01:22:59.882
Mary, you have to run, understand?

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:02.111
I don't know what I did
to make her mad.

01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:04.721
Is she beside you?
She went to get her pills.

01:23:04.728 --> 01:23:09.155
Listen to me. This woman, she's crazy.
It's not your fault. It's nothing you did.

01:23:09.165 --> 01:23:11.298
But she's gonna try
to hurt you again.

01:23:11.303 --> 01:23:13.436
- I'm scared.
- I know, baby.

01:23:13.437 --> 01:23:16.871
But you gotta get outta there, okay?
So you have to run. Go, go now!

01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:19.028
- But she locked the door.
- Pull! Pull it harder!

01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:21.176
She locked them!
She locked them both!

01:23:21.177 --> 01:23:23.273
Mary, you have to run!

01:24:17.964 --> 01:24:19.787
I waited, Mary.

01:24:19.799 --> 01:24:22.431
I waited all this time.

01:24:22.437 --> 01:24:26.399
I wanted you to know why
you're going to die.

01:24:26.408 --> 01:24:29.629
You shouldn't have tried to kill me.

01:24:29.643 --> 01:24:31.636
Mary, are you there?

01:24:32.179 --> 01:24:33.364
Hello?

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.702
Okay, I want you to grab a knife,
Mary, from the kitchen.

01:24:36.715 --> 01:24:40.143
Okay? Grab a really big knife.
Tell me when you have it.

01:24:40.154 --> 01:24:43.489
Do you have it?
I can't, she's coming.

01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:47.060
You never
should have lied to me, Mary.

01:24:47.061 --> 01:24:52.784
Mary, the wardrobe.
Do you see the wardrobe?

01:24:53.598 --> 01:24:56.354
- See the wardrobe in the bedroom?
- I see it.

01:24:56.401 --> 01:24:58.533
I want you to smash the mirror,
okay?

01:24:58.539 --> 01:25:01.464
I want you to kick it
as hard as you can.

01:25:01.473 --> 01:25:04.008
She's coming!
Just do it!

01:25:08.313 --> 01:25:11.739
Mary? Grab one of the pieces, Mary.

01:25:11.749 --> 01:25:14.905
- Grab one of the pieces.
- She's in the room!

01:25:14.921 --> 01:25:17.347
- You know what you have to do.
- I can't!

01:25:17.356 --> 01:25:20.008
Stick it in her, Mary,
as hard as you can!

01:25:20.025 --> 01:25:23.160
- Please, don't make me.
- Do it, Mary!

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:27.958
- Do it now!
- Go away! Leave me alone!

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.356
Her eyes are open.

01:26:09.006 --> 01:26:12.263
And she's lying on the floor.

01:26:13.343 --> 01:26:15.905
Her eyes are open.

01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:21.443
Go home, Mary.

01:26:23.384 --> 01:26:25.138
Go home.

01:27:11.866 --> 01:27:15.154
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What do you want?

01:27:17.036 --> 01:27:19.964
"Hi, honey.
Tough day at work?"

01:27:20.474 --> 01:27:22.796
No, sweetheart, it's fine.
It's all fine.

01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:26.806
Oh, hello there. Hello.

01:27:27.314 --> 01:27:29.638
- Get outta my house.
- Is there any beer?

01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:31.710
I said, get out.

01:27:37.825 --> 01:27:41.148
All right,
if you put it that way.

01:27:49.034 --> 01:27:50.457
See what you made me do?

01:27:59.345 --> 01:28:01.338
How about that beer?

01:28:08.886 --> 01:28:12.314
Please, don't make me.

01:28:14.828 --> 01:28:17.582
Last chance, Steven.

01:28:17.896 --> 01:28:19.548
Yeah?

01:28:20.165 --> 01:28:21.883
Or what?

01:28:50.062 --> 01:28:54.785
Bobby, Bobby Shafto

01:28:54.799 --> 01:28:58.794
He'll come back and marry me

01:28:58.802 --> 01:29:03.763
Pretty Bobby Shafto

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:09.135
Bobby Shafto's tall and fair

01:29:10.305 --> 01:29:16.505
