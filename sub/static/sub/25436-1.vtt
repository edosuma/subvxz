33:08.667 --> 33:10.458
Sam, he shot Harry.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.292
He shot Harry? Where's Fred?

33:14.750 --> 33:15.750
Harry march shot him?

33:18.042 --> 33:19.083
- Yeah!
- Ls he dead?

33:21.375 --> 33:24.215
What did you do? You fuckin' leave
him there for the dingoes to eat him?

33:24.542 --> 33:25.542
Barney!

33:25.667 --> 33:28.167
Saddle up your horse, mate.
Go get into town.

33:28.542 --> 33:31.208
You need to tell the coppers that
bloke Harry march has been shot.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.620
And get a doctor to go out to black hill
station. Tell him I'll meet him there.

33:36.417 --> 33:38.167
What the fuck are you doin', Archie?

33:40.208 --> 33:42.000
Get the fuck outta here, arch!

33:43.042 --> 33:44.833
Go put a cover over the body! Go now!

33:46.333 --> 33:50.000
Go and get in there and get some bread
and some damper. Get out of my way.

33:52.708 --> 33:54.625
Wait! Where's that philomac?

33:55.625 --> 33:57.167
Where the fuck is philomac?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.708
Eyes back in your head, mate.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.875
She's gonna be busy tonight.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.792
You can buy me a drink before you go.

36:21.958 --> 36:23.000
What are you looking at?

37:03.750 --> 37:04.750
Sergeant!

37:05.833 --> 37:07.333
Sergeant!

37:07.417 --> 37:08.417
What?

37:09.250 --> 37:10.417
I have a message for you!

37:14.750 --> 37:15.750
Message?

37:16.875 --> 37:19.083
Better be from his royal bloody highness.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.167
Constable minty.

37:38.542 --> 37:40.708
Sorry sir, there's been a shooting.

37:49.292 --> 37:50.708
Get up! Fuck off.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.042
Doc already gone?

37:54.417 --> 37:55.417
Yeah, this morning.

37:57.625 --> 37:58.833
Saddle up the horses, eh?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Yes, sarge.

39:29.917 --> 39:30.917
Uncle.

39:34.625 --> 39:36.375
Where the fuck have you been, philomac?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.000
Where the fuck have you been?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.417
Don't look at him. Look here!

39:45.208 --> 39:46.208
Where have you been?

39:46.458 --> 39:47.542
He tied me up.

39:48.083 --> 39:49.083
What?

39:51.708 --> 39:52.875
You mean he chained you up?

39:54.083 --> 39:55.083
What'd you do?

39:55.167 --> 39:56.167
Nothing.

40:01.542 --> 40:02.542
You see what happened?

40:06.667 --> 40:07.667
No, boss.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.500
Philomac, Harry march is dead.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.625
He was shot.

40:23.167 --> 40:24.167
Shot in the head.

40:27.917 --> 40:28.917
Did you see it?

40:29.208 --> 40:30.208
No.

40:33.542 --> 40:35.042
That blackfella Sam killed him.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.042
You see it happen?

40:50.042 --> 40:51.167
You didn't see it happen?

40:52.875 --> 40:53.875
No.

41:49.417 --> 41:51.042
Today we honour Harry march...

41:52.708 --> 41:54.792
A man I did not have
the pleasure of meeting.

41:56.292 --> 41:58.333
A man who, like myself, was a soldier.

41:59.875 --> 42:01.583
Fought for king and country.

42:02.458 --> 42:03.667
Put his life on the line.

42:07.417 --> 42:08.875
They shall not grow old

42:10.000 --> 42:11.625
as we that are left grow old.

42:13.042 --> 42:14.958
Age shall not weary them or the...

42:15.708 --> 42:16.833
Years condemn.

42:18.167 --> 42:19.583
At the going down of the sun,

42:20.417 --> 42:21.542
and in the morning,

42:23.500 --> 42:24.833
we will remember them.

42:33.958 --> 42:35.333
So why are you here, Smith?

42:37.500 --> 42:40.083
I want to see him come
back alive, sergeant.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.083
What are you doing?

43:40.125 --> 43:41.845
No, you're not.
You're over with the horses.

43:42.792 --> 43:43.792
Go on, get.

43:49.750 --> 43:51.583
That was a bit harsh, wasn't it sergeant?

43:53.500 --> 43:56.042
Crown wants him to look after
the horses, not just track.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.792
Look at you mob of miserable bastards.
Can't one of you sing?

44:04.708 --> 44:06.333
Didn't anyone bring a harmonica?

45:19.083 --> 45:20.167
Yeah, we got that.

45:27.375 --> 45:28.708
We gonna catch this murderer?

45:30.958 --> 45:31.958
You sure?

45:32.792 --> 45:33.792
Yes boss.

45:35.042 --> 45:36.042
When?

46:02.042 --> 46:04.375
I didn't steal from him. He was dead.

48:11.042 --> 48:12.042
Hey-

48:35.792 --> 48:36.833
Kennedy?

48:38.375 --> 48:41.375
That half-caste kid at the station.
Ls he your son?

48:44.292 --> 48:45.292
What's his name?

48:47.458 --> 48:48.458
Philomac.

48:48.917 --> 48:50.000
Philomac, yeah.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.720
You make sure you look
after him, won't you?

48:55.333 --> 48:57.708
Otherwise I'm going to
have to take him away.

50:05.833 --> 50:06.833
Fuck.

51:15.167 --> 51:16.250
Who owns this land?

52:38.500 --> 52:39.500
- Boss!
- What?

52:39.583 --> 52:42.083
- Boss?
- Ha! Go on!

53:35.500 --> 53:36.500
Jesus Christ.

53:37.750 --> 53:38.750
Go! Go on!

53:40.750 --> 53:41.625
Halt!

53:41.708 --> 53:42.708
[Gunshofl

54:12.750 --> 54:13.875
- Halt!
- Sweet Jesus.

54:14.292 --> 54:15.583
What the fuck was that, Archie?

54:16.500 --> 54:17.500
Huh?

54:29.458 --> 54:30.458
Where's minty?

54:31.250 --> 54:32.809
- He's dead, mate.
- What happened to minty?

54:32.833 --> 54:34.473
- We need to go back for him.
- He's dead.

54:35.708 --> 54:36.708
We gotta go!

54:39.250 --> 54:40.810
Listen, we need to go back for him now!

54:41.250 --> 54:42.250
You bastard!

54:42.542 --> 54:43.750
You set us up, didn't ya?

54:44.958 --> 54:46.309
You led us straight into an ambush!

54:46.333 --> 54:47.792
That's enough! Get off him!

54:49.292 --> 54:51.208
You gonna leave, alright, well leave.

54:51.292 --> 54:52.500
We're not leavin'!

54:53.167 --> 54:54.167
We're not leavin'.

54:54.958 --> 54:58.583
Not until that murdering bastard
is swinging by his neck!

55:05.375 --> 55:07.292
We'll set up camp a couple of miles back,

55:08.667 --> 55:10.042
and start out again tomorrow.

55:12.542 --> 55:13.542
And you...

55:14.208 --> 55:15.625
You try to run...

55:16.125 --> 55:17.792
And I will shoot you in the back.

55:18.792 --> 55:20.250
Do you understand?

55:22.958 --> 55:24.500
Won't do any good, sergeant.

55:25.542 --> 55:27.542
Sam's way smarter than we are.

55:27.750 --> 55:28.833
All these days.

55:29.708 --> 55:32.458
All these days we never come
within two miles of him.

55:33.083 --> 55:35.875
He's probably sitting out there now,
looking at ya.

55:37.625 --> 55:38.750
Laughin'.

55:57.583 --> 55:58.833
Do you wanna do that again?

55:59.958 --> 56:01.333
'Cause I'll turn the other cheek.

56:02.750 --> 56:03.750
Well do ya?

56:12.458 --> 56:13.875
I think I'm done here, Kennedy.

56:19.833 --> 56:20.833
I'm going home.

56:36.875 --> 56:38.208
You're not right, Fletcher.

56:39.958 --> 56:41.292
You're not right in the head.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Fuckin'

59:00.875 --> 59:01.917
what is it?

59:08.458 --> 59:09.583
Pretty bad one, mate.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.960
Won't kill ya but it's gonna
make ya bloody crook.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
I know what that is.

59:19.125 --> 59:20.125
Oh, Jesus.

59:21.500 --> 59:22.500
Jeez!

59:23.125 --> 59:24.445
We'll get you back to town, mate.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.667
I'm not goin' back.

59:27.167 --> 59:28.458
I know he's here somewhere.

59:29.125 --> 59:31.167
I'm gonna get him. Sam!

59:33.292 --> 59:34.708
Sam, I know you're here.

59:36.125 --> 59:37.375
And you can hear me!

59:39.917 --> 59:40.958
I'm comin' for ya.

59:42.667 --> 59:44.083
And it won't be long!

59:46.792 --> 59:49.125
It won't be long, Sam!

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.208
How far to water out there, arch?

01:00:27.292 --> 01:00:28.792
Oh, we're gonna die out there.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.487
That's what he wants us to think.

01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:33.417
Nuh.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.000
Been out two weeks. Got a station to run.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.208
Fuck off, then.

01:00:39.917 --> 01:00:40.958
Go on, fuck off!

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.750
Giving you my water.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.125
Fuck off, go on.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I gave you my water.

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.500
Go home.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:01.583
Come on, Archie.

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:05.667
Go on.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.750
Go on.

01:06:00.792 --> 01:06:01.833
Shut up, philomac.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.333
Sorry, boss.

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:08.203
What are you grinning about?

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:11.000
Couldn't get him eh, boss?

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:13.958
Oh, they're gonna get him.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:21.167
You like 'em?

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:23.708
Pick em up.

01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:29.417
You're gonna be a man,
a man needs a pair of boots.

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.667
You gonna be head stockman?

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:40.042
What about Archie?

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:42.625
Archie's an idiot.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:46.917
You're smarter than him.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.750
You move into the bunkhouse tonight.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:51.958
Put those on. You gotta get away
from all that blackfella shit.

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:53.167
Yes, boss.

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:55.167
Whoa.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:04.042
This my country.

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.208
Hey!

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.292
Fred he's a good man.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:41.583
Maybe that god... looking after us.

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:43.125
Yeah.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.833
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the story of... the Kelly gang!

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:16.042
Get your bloody hands off her!

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:44.458
Get him!

01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:46.833
Get him!

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.667
- Oh, come on!
- Hey!

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:56.375
Bloody amazing.

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:04.125
The Kelly gang escapes
the long arm of the law.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.833
I couldn't fuckin' get him.

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:30.667
I couldn't get him.

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:38.125
I'm tired, Nell.

01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:43.167
Some sweet country out there.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:46.667
Cattle country.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.250
You don't want your daughter
working here, in a bar.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:55.833
You know...

01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:58.208
We could find something.

01:15:58.917 --> 01:15:59.917
Together.

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:10.292
I lost a good man out there!

01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:14.458
And you're cheering this rubbish?

01:16:17.542 --> 01:16:18.542
Go home!

01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:20.792
All of you.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:23.250
Just get.

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:08.292
I owe you that.

01:19:18.917 --> 01:19:20.000
And that's for minty.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:28.750
Archie!

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:38.208
Come over here, pack up the cart.
We're going into town.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:43.042
Been called as a witness.

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:50.125
A witness.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I don't know.

01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:06.542
A witness

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:09.125
Archie, you fuckin' dolt.

01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:14.958
Witness means that you answer
questions when the judge asks 'em.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:16.583
Yes, boss!

01:21:16.792 --> 01:21:18.167
And you answer him properly.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.500
None of your fuckin' bullshit.

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:26.250
Philomac.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.125
You see?

01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:31.833
Told you they'd catch him.

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.375
Want some?

01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:56.833
- Yes.
- How much?

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:10.583
Who's your friend?

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:14.417
We was just talkin'.

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:17.250
And now you're talkin' to me.

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:19.458
No I'm not.

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:40.792
Fuckin' what, then?

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:45.208
Brandy, thanks.

01:22:49.042 --> 01:22:50.375
What the fuck's Campbell doing?

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:53.125
He's releasing her, as instructed.

01:22:56.458 --> 01:22:59.042
Whose instructions would they be?

01:22:59.792 --> 01:23:01.042
They would be mine.

01:23:02.167 --> 01:23:03.167
And who are you?

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.833
Judge Taylor.

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:07.975
I've been assigned to oversee the
committal hearing for Sam Kelly.

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:19.292
You're a judge, eh?

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.667
You look like a boy.

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.208
You have no authority here.

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:30.500
The crown has vested me
with the authority, sergeant.

01:23:32.167 --> 01:23:33.500
Now come have a drink with me.

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:35.917
Get to know each other,
before things get underway.

01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:38.333
You buying?

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:40.292
If you like.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:46.208
Drink for the sergeant.

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.708
I notice there's no court house in town.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.917
Where will the, ah,
proceedings be taking place?

01:24:17.417 --> 01:24:18.417
Sitting in it.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.250
Right here.

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:25.458
Well I'm not going to have
my courtroom in a pub.

01:24:26.375 --> 01:24:27.500
Is there a...

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:28.750
A church?

01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:32.792
Not in this town, judge.

01:24:35.417 --> 01:24:36.417
Well...

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:14.750
Boy?

01:25:16.792 --> 01:25:17.958
Hear that hammering?

01:25:20.333 --> 01:25:22.083
Gonna hang you high, boy.

01:25:27.792 --> 01:25:29.458
You think the law's gonna protect you?

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.333
I am the law.

01:25:53.250 --> 01:25:55.583
Could you all be upstanding
for judge Taylor.

01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:15.208
Take your seat.

01:26:32.333 --> 01:26:33.333
Hang the black!

01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:37.875
Order!

01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:39.117
Yeah, and hang the judge, too.

01:26:39.708 --> 01:26:40.958
I said order!

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Hey!

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:44.833
Sam, you'll be right, mate.

01:26:58.417 --> 01:26:59.542
Sam Kelly.

01:27:00.958 --> 01:27:04.375
You have been brought before this court to
determine if you have a case to answer to,

01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:06.167
in the death of Harry march.

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:10.792
There seems to be no doubt that
you shot and killed mr march,

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.375
but what we are here to determine,

01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:16.792
are the circumstances that led
to you pulling the trigger.

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:20.458
Sam Kelly, do you understand?

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:24.750
Mr Kelly.

01:27:28.292 --> 01:27:29.750
Do you understand?

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:36.292
I call the first witness

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:37.833
doctor shields.

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:42.625
I was informed of the death of Harry march

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:44.750
and was asked to go to black hill station.

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:47.792
What'd you find when you got there?

01:27:48.792 --> 01:27:51.375
I found the body of Harry march
laid out where he died.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.708
He was there, that blackfella.

01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:57.835
He'd put a canvas over the body and
he was trying to keep the flies off it.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:04.583
Order!

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.667
I examined the deceased, Harry march.

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.917
He'd been there for a good day and a half.

01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:13.375
A gunshot wound to the neck
had severed the carotid artery.

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.833
He would have died almost immediately.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:17.792
Were there any other wounds?

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:20.500
No, there was the smell of rum,
which was very strong.

01:28:21.792 --> 01:28:24.625
A few yards away there was a
rifle with a bayonet attached.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:28.583
And there was another rifle, a little way
off which I presume was the murder weapon.

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:30.890
A murder is yet to be determined, doctor.

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:33.518
Please stick to the facts and keep
your presumptions to yourself.

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.917
Yes, your honour.

01:28:38.167 --> 01:28:39.625
Please remove your hat.

01:28:39.792 --> 01:28:41.042
You're in a court of law.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Archie.

01:28:45.792 --> 01:28:46.958
Do you have a second name?

01:28:52.167 --> 01:28:54.625
I want you to tell me what
happened at black hill.

01:29:07.917 --> 01:29:08.792
We'll get to that.

01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:11.208
I want to know what happened
before he was killed.

01:29:18.292 --> 01:29:19.833
That isn't my question.

01:29:25.208 --> 01:29:26.208
Order.

01:29:31.417 --> 01:29:33.292
Why did you go to black hill station?

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.167
Philomac?

01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:41.000
The boy who accompanied you
to Harry march's property?

01:29:46.875 --> 01:29:48.750
Why were you looking for him at black hill?

01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:54.542
His chains?

01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:55.833
Yeah.

01:30:03.167 --> 01:30:04.708
Why did he chain him up?

01:30:09.792 --> 01:30:11.333
Why did he chain him up?

01:31:13.125 --> 01:31:14.375
I call to the stand

01:31:14.458 --> 01:31:16.000
the defendant's wife, Lizzie.

01:31:20.292 --> 01:31:21.333
Lizzie.

01:31:26.625 --> 01:31:27.625
Lizzie!

01:31:29.167 --> 01:31:30.875
Mr Smith, is there a problem?

01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:34.238
There's no problem, your honour.

01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:37.958
Lizzie, come on for Sam.

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:39.375
Come on.

01:31:39.667 --> 01:31:41.083
The lord will watch over you.

01:31:42.542 --> 01:31:43.542
Come on.

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:46.958
There you are.

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:49.417
You'll be alright.

01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:55.250
I understand you're nervous.

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:58.458
I only have a few questions.

01:32:02.667 --> 01:32:04.750
When you and your husband returned from

01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:07.417
Harry march's property
to black hill station,

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:13.750
Sam Kelly asked mr Fred Smith to take
your niece Lucy back into town.

01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:16.458
Why?

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:26.958
Lizzie, you do understand you have
to answer these questions.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.708
Lizzie, did Harry march...

01:32:38.667 --> 01:32:41.167
Physically assault your niece, Lucy?

01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:46.333
You must reply.

01:32:53.583 --> 01:32:56.500
I remind you you are compelled
to answer my questions.

01:33:06.542 --> 01:33:07.917
This is getting nowhere.

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:09.458
You may step down.

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:26.042
I call to the stand,
the defendant, Sam Kelly.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.750
Well what's he got to say?

01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:33.417
Any last words?

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.917
Mr Kelly, please remove your hat.

01:33:57.333 --> 01:33:59.958
We was doing work on his property.

01:34:01.958 --> 01:34:05.042
Woman's doing housework.

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.167
And that Harry...

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.125
Mr march...

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.958
He been lookin' at Lucy funny way.

01:34:17.792 --> 01:34:19.167
He been askin' about me.

01:34:21.167 --> 01:34:22.208
Is she promise?

01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:25.250
Promise?

01:34:26.958 --> 01:34:29.375
Yeah, like promise husband for Lucy.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.125
What did you say?

01:34:34.375 --> 01:34:35.542
Didn't like that.

01:34:38.542 --> 01:34:39.625
He been tell us.

01:34:40.833 --> 01:34:42.083
He been kick us off

01:34:42.917 --> 01:34:44.083
from his property.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.750
Told us to get.

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:48.750
No Tucker.

01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:50.625
Nothing.

01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:54.458
What was the reason he gave for
kicking you off his property?

01:35:00.833 --> 01:35:01.833
I think

01:35:04.042 --> 01:35:06.167
I think shame job for him.

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:13.000
I must say, mr Kelly, I don't understand
why Harry march would have been ashamed.

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:17.958
Why do you think he was ashamed, mr Kelly?

01:35:25.125 --> 01:35:27.000
Mr Kelly, I'm asking you a question.

01:35:32.542 --> 01:35:33.917
What he done to my wife.

01:35:36.042 --> 01:35:38.042
What did he do to your wife, mr Kelly?

01:35:42.667 --> 01:35:46.208
Did Harry march force
himself onto your wife?

01:35:52.417 --> 01:35:55.833
Is that why you shot him?
Because he forced himself onto your wife?

01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:59.667
No, he was gonna kill me.

01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:06.083
Did you see Harry march
force himself onto your wife?

01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:18.542
Mr Kelly, did you see Harry march
force himself onto your wife?

01:36:25.542 --> 01:36:27.167
You must answer me.

01:36:32.958 --> 01:36:34.542
My wife family way now.

01:36:36.583 --> 01:36:39.042
That's why we stop running.

01:36:39.583 --> 01:36:40.667
We been keep up.

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:48.458
Whitefella never catch me.

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:52.083
I ask you again.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:56.500
Did you see Harry march
force himself onto your wife?

01:37:01.875 --> 01:37:02.958
Mi" Kelly!

01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:06.375
I'm asking you a question.

01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:11.000
This finish now.

01:37:14.042 --> 01:37:16.000
Sam Kelly, you listen to me.

01:37:17.708 --> 01:37:19.333
This is a court of law,

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:22.208
and if you do not answer my questions,
you are in contempt,

01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:25.042
and I will place you in jail
until you decide to answer.

01:37:25.292 --> 01:37:28.625
More than that, I will place your
wife in jail for contempt, too.

01:37:39.292 --> 01:37:40.708
About three weeks ago...

01:37:41.583 --> 01:37:44.417
Harry march come looking
for that little boy...

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:45.625
Philomac.

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.083
He was shouting.

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.667
He started shooting.

01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.375
He come to the front door.

01:37:55.083 --> 01:37:56.958
Even point the gun at me.

01:37:58.208 --> 01:38:00.042
I been grab Fred's gun

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.083
and I been shoot him right there.

01:38:03.667 --> 01:38:04.667
Finish.

01:38:09.042 --> 01:38:10.625
Why did you run, mr Kelly?

01:38:13.667 --> 01:38:14.917
I shot a whitefella.

01:38:17.875 --> 01:38:21.417
And you say you only gave yourself
up because your wife is with child?

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:32.810
How long has your wife been with child?

01:38:38.792 --> 01:38:40.083
Since Harry march.

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.875
How do you know the child's not yours?

01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:52.000
Can't have kids.

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:54.958
Can't have family.

01:39:27.542 --> 01:39:29.625
Sam Kelly, you may step down.

01:39:38.167 --> 01:39:39.917
Fuckin' chook is ready!

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.500
Two weeks off.

01:39:52.083 --> 01:39:53.667
Two weeks, no fuckin' work.

01:39:54.208 --> 01:39:55.728
- Archie's a fuckin'...
- Hey, old man.

01:39:56.667 --> 01:39:57.667
Old man!

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.500
Got a nice lubra to keep
you warm tonight, eh?

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:07.000
If I was twenty years younger, mate...

01:40:08.708 --> 01:40:09.958
Take it easy, Fred.

01:40:10.167 --> 01:40:11.458
Just havin' a laugh, mate.

01:40:12.083 --> 01:40:14.792
Go say goodbye to your black.
He's gonna be hangin' tomorrow!

01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:50.333
He that is unjust

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.708
let him be unjust still.

01:40:53.792 --> 01:40:56.292
And he which is filthy,
let him be filthy still.

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:59.083
And he that is righteous

01:41:00.042 --> 01:41:01.542
let him be righteous still.

01:41:02.417 --> 01:41:05.458
And he that is holy,
let him be holy still and behold,

01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:07.833
my reward is with me.

01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:11.292
For give me every man,
according as his work shall be.

01:41:11.875 --> 01:41:14.792
For I am Alpha and omega

01:41:15.125 --> 01:41:19.083
the beginning and the end,
the first and the last.

01:41:20.083 --> 01:41:23.417
Blessed are they that do his commandments.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.875
You're fuckin' joking.

01:41:24.958 --> 01:41:27.583
They that have the
right to the tree of life...

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:29.750
Philomac!

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:32.125
Into the gates and
into the city of god.

01:41:38.333 --> 01:41:39.434
Where the fuck have you been?

01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:40.458
Nowhere, boss.

01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:41.667
Shut up.

01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:44.167
Go with dickhead over here,
load up the sulky.

01:41:44.917 --> 01:41:47.198
We're getting out of here as
soon as this shit's finished.

01:41:48.292 --> 01:41:49.875
Go on, Archie. Fuck off.

01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:01.000
Could you all stand for judge Taylor.

01:42:10.417 --> 01:42:12.958
Have faith, Sam. God is with you.

01:42:16.417 --> 01:42:17.667
Take your seats.

01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:25.417
Come on, ya black bastard!

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.042
- Yeah!
- Hey, ya prick.

01:42:27.417 --> 01:42:28.417
Go away.

01:42:28.458 --> 01:42:29.476
- Fuckin' swing him.
- Bring him out.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.500
Hey?

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.667
Harry march went to black hill station

01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:58.542
in search of a boy by the name of philomac.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:02.500
It's clear he was not sober at the time

01:43:03.083 --> 01:43:05.083
and was in an agitated state.

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:10.042
He made the presumption,
that Sam Kelly and his wife,

01:43:10.292 --> 01:43:11.708
were sheltering the boy.

01:43:13.375 --> 01:43:15.708
Now Harry march could have
simply knocked at the door,

01:43:16.792 --> 01:43:18.083
but this was not the case.

01:43:20.292 --> 01:43:23.708
In his state of mind,
he made an aggressive approach,

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:27.917
which resulted in him kicking at the door
and firing a gun into the house.

01:43:32.917 --> 01:43:33.958
Order!

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.208
Order!

01:43:40.958 --> 01:43:44.875
Now when Harry march woke Sam Kelly
and his wife in this aggressive manner,

01:43:45.583 --> 01:43:47.750
did Sam Kelly fire the first shot?

01:43:48.583 --> 01:43:49.583
No.

01:43:50.292 --> 01:43:52.208
Did he fire the second shot?

01:43:52.667 --> 01:43:53.667
No.

01:43:53.958 --> 01:43:54.958
The third?

01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:56.625
No.

01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:04.125
Harry march, through his own actions,
caused a situation that ended in his death.

01:44:04.958 --> 01:44:07.667
Sam Kelly's actions were
the natural response,

01:44:07.958 --> 01:44:10.000
to a violent, unprovoked attack.

01:44:12.708 --> 01:44:17.208
I find that this is a case of self-defence
and the defendant has no case to answer.

01:44:17.292 --> 01:44:18.417
Sam Kelly...

01:44:18.833 --> 01:44:20.000
You are free to go.

01:44:21.667 --> 01:44:22.750
Order!

01:44:23.208 --> 01:44:24.792
This is a court of law!

01:44:24.875 --> 01:44:26.417
Take him back to the bush!

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.292
You wanna challenge the judge's verdict?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.333
Sergeant Fletcher...

01:44:35.958 --> 01:44:37.458
Please release the prisoner...

01:44:38.875 --> 01:44:40.667
And escort him safely out of town.

01:44:43.833 --> 01:44:44.833
Mongrel!

01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:46.250
Mongrel!

01:45:01.083 --> 01:45:03.458
I'll ride with you to the edge of town.

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:17.792
- Fuckin' let him go.
- Sam?

01:45:18.917 --> 01:45:20.750
Yep, a free man.

01:45:21.458 --> 01:45:22.667
Bloody bastard.

01:45:43.042 --> 01:45:44.333
Should be right from now on.

01:46:05.375 --> 01:46:06.375
You right, Sam?

01:46:07.083 --> 01:46:08.083
Yes, boss.

01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:11.417
Sam, don't call me boss.

01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:14.208
Yes, Fred.

01:46:23.292 --> 01:46:24.875
Oh, Sam, shit!

01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:26.083
Shit!

01:46:26.625 --> 01:46:27.792
Oh, Sam.

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:30.875
Fuck, Sam.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Oh shit.

01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:36.458
Sam?

01:48:10.958 --> 01:48:12.917
You cowards!

01:48:13.417 --> 01:48:15.292
Bloody cowards!

01:48:21.167 --> 01:48:22.417
Oh, shit.

01:48:46.333 --> 01:48:47.750
What chance have we got?

01:48:49.375 --> 01:48:51.542
What chance has this country got?

01:48:52.305 --> 01:48:58.179
