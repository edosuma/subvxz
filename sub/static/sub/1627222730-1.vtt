- [Radio Dispatch]
Seven Adam Two, standby.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.375
Seven Henry Three, roger.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.586
I'll show you 10-7 out for investigation

22:57.628 --> 22:59.171
on your previously run vehicle.

22:59.213 --> 23:01.089
- 10-4, thanks.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.007
- [Radio Dispatch] Seven Adam Two,

23:02.049 --> 23:03.342
go ahead with your
want warrant check.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.727
(eerie music)

23:18.148 --> 23:18.982
- V.A.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.026
That's a break.

23:22.361 --> 23:23.570
My partner's hat.

23:29.535 --> 23:30.786
- Partner?

23:30.827 --> 23:32.287
Is this personal?

23:32.329 --> 23:33.163
- No.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.456
This is a professional investigation

23:34.498 --> 23:35.916
with a personal connection.

23:35.958 --> 23:38.168
I will not let emotion
get in the way, ma'am.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.009
(eerie music)

23:46.051 --> 23:47.761
- Can't be too far.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.721
We should set up a perimeter.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.265
- They're not coming back.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.808
- How do you know?

23:52.850 --> 23:55.185
- They use things up and throw them away.

23:58.647 --> 23:59.523
- Let's get going.

24:00.858 --> 24:03.527
(ominous music)

24:16.373 --> 24:17.207
- Hey!

24:22.421 --> 24:23.380
- What happened?

24:24.882 --> 24:25.883
Can you hear me?

24:26.008 --> 24:26.967
- Please help him.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.218
- Call 9-1-1.

24:36.435 --> 24:39.188
(menacing music)

24:42.399 --> 24:45.068
- You're really good with
that typewriter in the car.

24:45.110 --> 24:45.986
- The computer?

24:46.904 --> 24:47.946
- Right.

24:47.988 --> 24:49.990
(girl screaming)

24:51.116 --> 24:54.119
(suspenseful music)

24:58.582 --> 25:01.251
(ominous music)

25:02.127 --> 25:03.378
- Any ID on him?

25:03.420 --> 25:04.713
- Clark Calhoon.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.215
- That's the RO from the car.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.592
- I saw the whole thing.

25:12.471 --> 25:13.472
- What did you see?

25:13.514 --> 25:16.141
- A jogger did CPR and
then she just ran off.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.392
- Which way did they go?

25:17.434 --> 25:18.268
- That way.

25:20.521 --> 25:21.522
- Seven Henry Three.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.942
Have fire...

25:24.983 --> 25:27.986
(suspenseful music)

25:58.809 --> 26:00.435
Did you find the witness?

26:00.477 --> 26:01.937
- Negative.

26:01.979 --> 26:03.647
- All right, uniforms are
setting up a perimeter

26:03.689 --> 26:04.815
and the bus just left.

26:04.857 --> 26:05.691
- He's dead.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.109
There's nothing more we can do here.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.152
- The paramedics detected
some electrical activity

26:09.194 --> 26:10.195
on the EKG.

26:10.237 --> 26:11.071
- I assure you,

26:11.113 --> 26:13.448
Mr. Calhoon has shuffled
off this mortal coil.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.203
(police sirens approaching)

26:25.836 --> 26:27.129
- These guys have no record.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.297
What's their M.O.?

26:28.338 --> 26:29.256
What do they want?

26:31.592 --> 26:33.635
- Someone call for homicide?

26:33.677 --> 26:34.803
- Crap.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.390
- Body's on route to Boyle Heights.

26:38.432 --> 26:39.600
- Oh.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.351
If it ain't dead yet it will be soon, huh?

26:41.393 --> 26:42.269
Am I right?

26:42.311 --> 26:43.228
(chuckling)

26:43.270 --> 26:44.479
Hey, we haven't been introduced.

26:44.521 --> 26:45.981
Detective Sergeant Tom Wilson.

26:46.023 --> 26:47.524
- Special Agent Cooper Miller.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.068
- Special, huh?

26:50.110 --> 26:51.111
Hey,

26:51.153 --> 26:53.864
you mind if I get a moment alone
with my partner here, Coop?

26:54.948 --> 26:55.782
- Yeah.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.326
- It's Cooper.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.119
- Cooper, sure.

27:06.585 --> 27:08.337
What happened to "I only work alone."

27:08.378 --> 27:09.713
- It's an assignment.

27:10.589 --> 27:12.174
I don't answer to you.

27:12.216 --> 27:13.467
- [Tom] You don't answer
your phone either.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.093
- [Lisa] Yeah, why should I?

27:15.135 --> 27:16.512
- Look, I'm trying to apologize.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.554
- For what?

27:17.596 --> 27:18.972
There's nothing left to say.

27:19.014 --> 27:19.848
- Give me a break.

27:19.890 --> 27:22.392
- You are a liar, you're dishonest.

27:22.476 --> 27:23.602
- I fucked up but don't act

27:23.644 --> 27:25.312
like you're so innocent in all this.

27:25.354 --> 27:27.898
- Oh what, are you accusing
me of something now?

27:27.940 --> 27:29.358
- Exactly, what about my needs?

27:29.399 --> 27:30.442
- Oh, this is about your needs?

27:30.484 --> 27:31.818
This is so typical.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.195
You're such a fucking selfish prick!

27:33.237 --> 27:34.488
- Lost cause, "look at me."

27:34.530 --> 27:36.365
You know what, fuck you.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.158
- There's no excuse for profanity.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.701
Not in the presence of a lady.

27:39.743 --> 27:40.702
(chuckling)

27:40.744 --> 27:42.037
- Lady?

27:42.079 --> 27:43.038
What the fuck do you know?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.206
Piss off.

27:44.248 --> 27:46.291
- Agent Miller, stand down please.

27:47.209 --> 27:48.418
I can handle this.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.462
- Better listen to your handler.

27:51.964 --> 27:53.757
- Apologize to the lady.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.760
- You know what, fuck you!

27:56.927 --> 27:57.761
Fuck --

27:57.803 --> 27:59.471
(groaning)

27:59.805 --> 28:03.517
- I said, apologize to Detective McAdams.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.269
- And I said fuck you!

28:05.310 --> 28:07.521
(groaning)

28:09.106 --> 28:11.400
- Apologize to the lady.

28:11.441 --> 28:12.526
- Okay, all right.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.069
I'm sorry.

28:14.111 --> 28:15.237
Damn it, I'm sorry.

28:15.821 --> 28:16.864
Okay?

28:17.823 --> 28:18.699
Asshole.

28:21.535 --> 28:22.494
(thump)

28:23.620 --> 28:24.580
Fuck me.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.416
(groaning)

28:27.457 --> 28:28.292
Asshole.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.590
- That ring you saw me
throw out the window...

28:34.923 --> 28:36.091
He gave that to me.

28:36.341 --> 28:37.467
- If you don't mind me saying so ma'am,

28:37.509 --> 28:38.969
you dodged a bullet with that one.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.054
- Sure looks like it.

28:44.474 --> 28:45.309
How'd it feel?

28:46.935 --> 28:47.769
- Good.

28:49.605 --> 28:52.691
(ominous music)

28:52.733 --> 28:54.318
- What was I supposed to do?

28:55.986 --> 28:57.404
- You did fine.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.072
These bodies are flimsy.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.949
We'll have to choose more carefully.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.743
- You chose well this time.

29:07.497 --> 29:11.585
The only thing on this
planet better than eating

29:11.627 --> 29:12.586
is fornicating.

29:12.628 --> 29:13.629
- I prefer food.

29:16.632 --> 29:17.466
Just a bit.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.428
Maybe we can stay.

29:21.553 --> 29:24.598
We can clean this planet
up one pest at a time.

29:24.723 --> 29:25.557
- No.

29:25.766 --> 29:28.143
We kill them all and
we wait for the fleet.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.356
- I'm going to build a transmitter.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.067
We'll send the armada our coordinates.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.610
This is our new home.

29:37.611 --> 29:40.364
(menacing music)

29:43.742 --> 29:44.576
- Mmmm.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.705
You're right.

29:48.747 --> 29:50.123
It's delicious.

29:52.084 --> 29:52.918
- I know.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.301
That shit will kill you.

30:01.343 --> 30:02.261
- Doctor's orders.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.721
Lowers my stress.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.057
(chuckling)

30:07.766 --> 30:10.143
- Don't these people
have known accomplices?

30:11.728 --> 30:13.397
- Not anywhere around here.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.025
- I must admit,

30:18.068 --> 30:21.947
it's nice just having
one case to focus on.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.032
I'm usually working so many cases,

30:24.074 --> 30:26.243
I hardly know the people
I'm trying to help.

30:27.077 --> 30:27.995
- That stinks.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.121
- It does.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.083
- Sorry about Tom.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.918
- Don't apologize for him.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.228
- You eat nails and
shit bullets, don't you?

31:01.528 --> 31:04.656
(suspenseful beat music)

31:04.698 --> 31:09.119
The facial recognition software
identified a Frank Sterling.

31:09.161 --> 31:10.579
- Someone spotted him?

31:10.621 --> 31:12.998
- A computer over at headquarters did.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.459
- Right.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.128
- Come on, we gotta go.

31:19.213 --> 31:22.216
(suspenseful music)

31:29.473 --> 31:32.142
(ominous music)

31:37.523 --> 31:39.024
- Mr. Jackson.

31:39.066 --> 31:39.942
- Can I help you?

31:40.817 --> 31:42.945
- The paper you wrote on
extraterrestrial signal

31:42.986 --> 31:44.988
isolation and amplification was great.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.115
- Well, thank you.

31:47.157 --> 31:48.659
And who might you be?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.202
- I'm you.

31:50.244 --> 31:53.247
(menacing music)

31:53.288 --> 31:55.791
(man yelling)

31:57.960 --> 31:59.461
- How'd you end up doing this?

32:00.504 --> 32:01.588
- Missing persons?

32:02.506 --> 32:03.340
- Cop.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.635
I mean,

32:06.677 --> 32:10.556
what would draw a woman
to this line of work.

32:10.848 --> 32:13.183
- You rather I'd be home
barefoot and pregnant?

32:14.852 --> 32:16.311
- That's not what I meant.

32:16.353 --> 32:18.647
What's with the barefoot thing?

32:18.689 --> 32:20.065
I never understood that.

32:20.107 --> 32:22.526
- When you're pregnant, your feet swell.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.695
You know, I hate to shatter your delusions

32:24.736 --> 32:28.156
but I am perfectly
capable of doing my job.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.908
There is an Air Force study that found

32:29.950 --> 32:33.745
that women are actually
better pilots than men.

32:36.081 --> 32:37.332
- There.

32:37.374 --> 32:39.293
(foreboding music)

32:39.334 --> 32:40.169
Gun it!

32:41.461 --> 32:44.464
(suspenseful music)

32:46.175 --> 32:47.134
Cut him off!

33:12.451 --> 33:15.537
(ominous beat music)

33:34.681 --> 33:37.684
(suspenseful music)

33:51.323 --> 33:53.575
(rustling)

34:28.193 --> 34:31.071
(dishes clinking)

34:31.113 --> 34:33.782
(ominous music)

34:41.999 --> 34:45.002
(suspenseful music)

35:37.262 --> 35:39.515
(creaking)

35:46.063 --> 35:46.897
- Come on.

36:00.327 --> 36:01.370
Hands up.

36:09.711 --> 36:11.004
- You're making a mistake.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.007
- Turn around.

36:19.263 --> 36:20.931
Turn around.

36:26.603 --> 36:27.729
- I'm gonna be pretty.

36:29.231 --> 36:30.607
- Hands behind your back.

36:37.948 --> 36:39.032
(thud)

36:41.118 --> 36:43.370
(fizzling)

36:49.835 --> 36:50.919
- I'm going to be pretty.

36:52.212 --> 36:53.338
(thud)

36:54.840 --> 36:56.175
(gunshot)

36:57.509 --> 37:00.012
(eerie music)

37:14.193 --> 37:17.196
(suspenseful music)

37:28.207 --> 37:31.126
(foreboding music)

37:48.393 --> 37:50.687
- That was a crap-tacular night, huh?

37:52.105 --> 37:53.899
Get my head crushed,

37:53.941 --> 37:55.275
your suspects get away.

37:57.611 --> 37:58.445
- Pull over.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.908
In through your nose,
out through the mouth.

38:02.950 --> 38:03.951
- Yeah, I know how to breathe.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.494
- I know the shakes.

38:05.702 --> 38:06.662
Get out of the car.

38:08.622 --> 38:09.581
Trust me.

38:14.503 --> 38:16.255
(sighing)

38:39.069 --> 38:40.028
Jumping jacks.

38:41.905 --> 38:42.781
- What?

38:43.156 --> 38:44.825
- 50, now.

38:47.160 --> 38:47.995
- Seriously?

38:53.333 --> 38:55.669
(chuckling)

39:05.554 --> 39:06.805
Hey!

39:06.847 --> 39:07.764
What are you doing?

39:08.849 --> 39:10.851
- I don't have the shakes.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.269
That's 20.

39:12.311 --> 39:13.353
- But.

39:13.395 --> 39:14.229
- Faster!

39:15.314 --> 39:16.148
Faster!

39:18.400 --> 39:19.276
Faster!

39:20.611 --> 39:21.445
Faster!

39:23.113 --> 39:23.947
Faster!

39:27.451 --> 39:28.285
Good.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.341
- I'll be damned.

39:48.222 --> 39:49.890
- Can we check a few more places?

39:52.184 --> 39:53.810
Before we call it a night.

39:53.977 --> 39:54.811
Please?

39:56.522 --> 39:57.356
- Sure.

40:18.794 --> 40:22.089
(ominous music)

40:22.130 --> 40:23.298
- Are you sure?

40:23.340 --> 40:24.174
- I think so.

40:26.718 --> 40:27.845
It's kinda hard to tell.

40:28.136 --> 40:29.805
He shot me in the friggin' head.

40:32.683 --> 40:33.892
- What's going on?

40:34.852 --> 40:36.645
- Agent Miller is here.

40:36.728 --> 40:37.563
Maybe.

40:37.604 --> 40:38.438
- Here?

40:38.480 --> 40:39.314
Now?

40:39.356 --> 40:40.899
- I think he shot me in the head.

40:43.443 --> 40:44.528
- Time to connect.

40:49.408 --> 40:51.660
(fizzling)

40:56.164 --> 40:58.667
(eerie music)

41:10.053 --> 41:12.347
I can't tell if that was him or not.

41:12.389 --> 41:13.849
All right, we need to hurry up.

41:13.891 --> 41:15.184
If that was him,

41:15.225 --> 41:17.561
that tenacious bastard
will turn up eventually.

41:21.523 --> 41:23.567
- [Lisa] We can't keep running all night.

41:25.694 --> 41:28.238
What do you say we catch a few hours, huh?

41:29.698 --> 41:31.950
- You're not gonna lend
me your car, are you?

41:36.830 --> 41:38.040
- Where are you staying?

41:40.417 --> 41:41.251
Ah...

41:41.293 --> 41:42.252
- Hollywood Hilton.

41:47.549 --> 41:49.593
- You know, you can crash at my place.

41:50.636 --> 41:55.349
- That's awfully nice of
you but I'll be all right.

41:55.474 --> 41:58.519
- [Lisa] I have a
perfectly comfortable couch

41:58.685 --> 42:00.312
and you are welcome to it.

42:03.774 --> 42:04.608
- Thanks.

42:06.818 --> 42:07.653
- Mhmm.

42:10.781 --> 42:11.823
(security alarm beeping)

42:14.409 --> 42:16.370
It's a small place but --

42:18.247 --> 42:19.957
- Sure beats a motel.

42:20.082 --> 42:20.958
- I bet.

42:22.626 --> 42:23.460
Hey, girl.

42:31.635 --> 42:32.719
Make yourself at home.

42:36.139 --> 42:38.141
(soft Jazz plays)

43:00.080 --> 43:02.749
- Do you have any Nat King Cole?

43:03.625 --> 43:04.793
- Am I black?

43:09.131 --> 43:10.132
Wanna beer?

43:12.134 --> 43:14.094
- Sure, thanks.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.026
- Let's catch a couple of hours

43:29.067 --> 43:31.737
and get back at it in the morning.

43:31.778 --> 43:33.655
Sofa down there is a pullout.

43:36.033 --> 43:37.743
- Appreciate your hospitality, ma'am.

43:38.035 --> 43:39.494
I mean, Lisa.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.255
- Thanks for shooting
that guy in the head.

43:54.176 --> 43:55.219
Night.

44:39.429 --> 44:42.099
(clock ticking)

44:45.060 --> 44:47.563
(eerie music)

44:50.107 --> 44:53.277
(fizzling)

45:05.914 --> 45:08.750
(screams echoing)

45:25.893 --> 45:28.562
(ominous music)

46:07.851 --> 46:10.062
- Cooper Miller, Special...

46:11.188 --> 46:14.608
(suspenseful beat music)

46:21.490 --> 46:22.574
Who are you?

46:25.285 --> 46:27.079
1947?

46:44.555 --> 46:46.723
(yawning)

47:04.867 --> 47:07.536
(food sizzling)

47:35.647 --> 47:37.566
- Found the bacon in the freezer.

47:37.608 --> 47:40.736
Flower's a little old but
I think it will be okay.

47:40.777 --> 47:42.279
Couldn't find your coffee

47:42.321 --> 47:44.740
but I hope you like the
way I made your tea.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.331
- It's perfect.

47:54.249 --> 47:55.417
Thanks.

48:12.392 --> 48:15.062
(ominous music)

48:18.190 --> 48:20.692
- The other day you
wondered who would marry me.

48:24.071 --> 48:25.155
Her name was Virginia.

48:27.616 --> 48:28.992
She died in a plane crash.

48:30.661 --> 48:31.870
- Sorry about that.

48:33.038 --> 48:34.831
- She was a B-17 instructor.

48:40.254 --> 48:42.047
Suit gave me away, right?

48:42.089 --> 48:45.217
- That and the hotel you're staying at,

48:45.259 --> 48:46.552
the Hollywood Hilton,

48:48.053 --> 48:49.555
doesn't exist.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.432
- You're not gonna find me on
that computer thing either.

48:54.685 --> 48:56.728
- You're from 1947?

48:57.855 --> 48:59.356
- 1951.

48:59.731 --> 49:00.649
- Who are you?

49:05.571 --> 49:07.239
- My name is Cooper F. Miller,

49:07.281 --> 49:09.533
United States Army Intelligence Corp.

49:09.700 --> 49:13.287
On my base we housed a small
group of extraterrestrials.

49:14.496 --> 49:16.039
- Aliens?

49:16.623 --> 49:19.835
- Three of them escaped through
an experimental time portal.

49:20.043 --> 49:22.212
I chased them here.

49:24.631 --> 49:25.674
- Who's your president?

49:26.008 --> 49:26.884
- Harry S. Truman.

49:26.967 --> 49:28.177
- Who won the World Series?

49:28.260 --> 49:29.261
- Last year?

49:29.386 --> 49:30.387
Yankees in four.

49:30.429 --> 49:31.471
- Last movie you saw.

49:31.513 --> 49:32.848
- Sunset Boulevard.

49:34.349 --> 49:37.019
(ominous music)

49:50.908 --> 49:53.785
- These aliens are monsters, parasites.

49:54.828 --> 49:57.289
Looking for a host like you or me.

49:57.497 --> 50:00.250
Before they could communicate
what they had learned,

50:00.292 --> 50:01.210
we captured them.

50:02.085 --> 50:03.045
- We?

50:03.170 --> 50:04.588
- My partner and I.

50:04.671 --> 50:06.423
They killed him when they escaped.

50:08.342 --> 50:10.844
(eerie music)

50:15.641 --> 50:17.017
At least put the safety on.

50:24.149 --> 50:25.234
- I don't believe you.

50:25.275 --> 50:27.027
- Believe me or not,

50:27.069 --> 50:28.862
I'm dead in 24 hours

50:31.823 --> 50:35.244
and these monsters go free
and then everyone dies.

50:35.285 --> 50:36.662
I can't do this alone.

50:39.998 --> 50:46.296
- Every instinct in my
body tells me you're lying.

50:50.634 --> 50:52.511
But I don't trust those anymore.

51:00.102 --> 51:02.688
(somber music)

51:07.401 --> 51:09.486
- Here, eat this.

51:09.528 --> 51:10.404
- Seriously?

51:10.445 --> 51:12.030
- It's for your own protection.

51:21.039 --> 51:22.457
- Hmmm.

51:38.348 --> 51:41.143
It's definitely the man I
chased in the alley yesterday.

51:41.226 --> 51:43.312
- You didn't call the FBI shoot team.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.147
- How long until that becomes a problem?

51:45.230 --> 51:46.857
- Any minute now.

51:46.899 --> 51:47.733
- Oh, darn.

51:50.986 --> 51:52.696
(knocking)

51:56.742 --> 51:57.618
- [Lisa] We're here about

51:57.659 --> 51:59.411
the missing persons report you filed.

52:00.412 --> 52:01.246
- Ma'am.

52:11.548 --> 52:13.759
- What is your husband's area of research?

52:13.800 --> 52:14.927
- He's best known for his work

52:14.968 --> 52:17.179
on astrophysics and particle theory.

52:17.221 --> 52:18.222
- What was his...

52:20.933 --> 52:22.351
is his passion?

52:27.814 --> 52:31.109
- Meredith, we're here to help Ted.

52:31.151 --> 52:33.904
Sometimes every little
piece of information

52:33.946 --> 52:35.322
makes a difference.

52:37.491 --> 52:39.368
- He worked for SETI for many years.

52:39.618 --> 52:41.453
Broke his heart when they shut it down.

52:41.787 --> 52:42.746
- SETI?

52:42.829 --> 52:46.166
- "Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence."

52:46.208 --> 52:47.042
- You're kidding.

52:48.585 --> 52:51.255
(ominous music)

52:56.635 --> 52:57.594
Thanks, ma'am.

52:57.636 --> 52:59.346
- Is my husband going to be okay?

53:03.141 --> 53:05.727
- I will do everything
in my power to find him.

53:07.020 --> 53:09.606
(somber music)

53:21.743 --> 53:23.620
He's dead, right?

53:23.662 --> 53:24.496
- Afraid so.

53:24.538 --> 53:25.372
- Damn.

53:28.458 --> 53:29.293
What's wrong?

53:29.334 --> 53:30.419
- Pins and needles.

53:31.378 --> 53:33.130
Doc Opp said this could happen.

53:33.964 --> 53:36.258
You were really great
in there, you were kind.

53:37.342 --> 53:39.678
- I've made too many
promises I couldn't keep.

53:40.721 --> 53:42.556
I don't do that anymore.

53:46.393 --> 53:47.853
- What do they want with him?

53:47.895 --> 53:49.271
He can't build them a ship.

53:50.147 --> 53:52.649
(eerie music)

53:56.612 --> 53:58.530
- They're not trying to get home.

54:01.658 --> 54:03.452
They're trying to call home.

54:05.579 --> 54:07.831
- All they would have to
do is send a location.

54:09.958 --> 54:11.168
That would be bad.

54:15.214 --> 54:18.008
- So these aliens we're chasing,

54:18.050 --> 54:19.676
are they the only ones out there?

54:20.719 --> 54:21.929
- You really wanna know?

54:25.641 --> 54:27.935
These are the only bad ones we've found.

54:29.353 --> 54:31.980
Remember the crash in 1947, Roswell?

54:33.815 --> 54:36.026
There is an alien race called the Greys.

54:38.070 --> 54:39.821
Only one survived.

54:40.781 --> 54:43.450
Little guy we named Albert.

54:43.492 --> 54:45.160
- After Einstein?

54:45.202 --> 54:46.870
- Albert the janitor.

54:46.912 --> 54:50.040
He liked to drink the
water from the mop bucket.

54:50.123 --> 54:50.999
- Oh.

54:51.917 --> 54:54.795
- Army doctors nursed him back
to health as best they could.

54:54.837 --> 54:57.714
Military built an
underground facility for him.

54:58.674 --> 55:02.261
Albert was the most gentle
creature I have ever known.

55:02.594 --> 55:04.930
The aliens we're chasing
were sent to this planet

55:04.972 --> 55:07.140
to destroy Albert.

55:07.307 --> 55:09.893
We stopped them but they escaped.

55:10.018 --> 55:11.353
We think they were after him because

55:11.395 --> 55:13.730
he showed us incredible
technology we could use

55:13.772 --> 55:15.399
to protect our planet.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.525
- Time travel.

55:17.734 --> 55:18.777
- Bingo.

55:20.612 --> 55:21.947
- Wow, okay.

55:24.032 --> 55:25.868
- Forget about the alien stuff.

55:26.743 --> 55:29.079
Imagine there' a bomb underneath this city

55:29.204 --> 55:31.081
and these three are the bomb makers.

55:32.499 --> 55:35.419
Doesn't matter who they
are or where they're from.

55:36.295 --> 55:37.462
We have to stop them.

55:40.215 --> 55:41.341
What are you thinking?

55:43.177 --> 55:46.388
- What do you need to make a transmitter?

55:46.430 --> 55:48.724
- Components, parts.

55:50.809 --> 55:52.728
- Surplus stores.

55:52.769 --> 55:54.313
They'd have to steal the parts.

55:56.231 --> 55:57.482
Or rob a bank.

55:58.901 --> 56:01.445
- We need to track down
that Doctor's credit cards.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.489
- Can you find that here?

56:05.741 --> 56:06.575
- I can't.

56:09.411 --> 56:10.454
Oh shit.

56:13.248 --> 56:17.002
This is going to hurt.

56:27.971 --> 56:29.848
(laughing)

56:33.143 --> 56:34.937
- What can I do for you?

56:40.025 --> 56:41.860
You talk to IA yet?

56:41.902 --> 56:43.278
- Not yet.

56:43.320 --> 56:44.696
- I though they were --

56:44.738 --> 56:46.031
- Don't think.

56:46.073 --> 56:47.658
It's not your strong suit.

56:50.869 --> 56:52.079
Got what I asked for?

56:53.705 --> 56:54.706
- Didn't realize I'd be doing this

56:54.748 --> 56:56.208
for "Captain Cheap Shot" over there.

56:58.210 --> 56:59.545
- Glass-jawed pansy.

57:01.171 --> 57:02.881
- You know what, screw this noise.

57:02.965 --> 57:05.676
(car engines starting)

57:08.303 --> 57:09.638
(honking)

57:13.517 --> 57:14.518
- What do you want?

57:16.228 --> 57:18.856
- Another chance.

57:19.064 --> 57:20.440
Shut it, G-man.

57:24.653 --> 57:25.487
- Dinner?

57:29.199 --> 57:30.075
- And?

57:32.786 --> 57:33.954
- No Tasers?

57:34.329 --> 57:35.706
(laughing)

57:37.958 --> 57:38.792
- That's it.

57:41.712 --> 57:43.505
I emailed the transactions to you.

57:48.010 --> 57:49.178
Later fucktard.

57:52.431 --> 57:55.184
(dramatic music)

58:13.368 --> 58:15.037
(entry bell ringing)

58:37.976 --> 58:38.810
- Hello?

58:50.656 --> 58:51.823
You recognize this man?

58:52.157 --> 58:54.535
- Not without a warrant, dude.

58:58.622 --> 59:01.667
- This man and his
accomplices are terrorists.

59:02.501 --> 59:04.294
- I heard that one before.

59:04.419 --> 59:07.089
- He deserves the truth.

59:09.132 --> 59:11.593
I'm Special Agent Lisa McAdams.

59:11.635 --> 59:14.179
This is Special Agent Cooper Miller.

59:14.263 --> 59:16.849
We're working an X-File.

59:16.974 --> 59:19.810
This man is an alien.

59:19.893 --> 59:20.853
(chuckling)

59:21.061 --> 59:21.895
- Aliens.

59:28.193 --> 59:29.027
Really?

59:29.862 --> 59:30.863
- We need your help.

59:34.324 --> 59:35.158
- Really?

59:36.660 --> 59:37.661
Awesome.

59:37.703 --> 59:39.204
Um, okay.

59:39.454 --> 59:41.206
Well, I haven't seen that guy before

59:41.248 --> 59:43.876
but I did sell a transmitter.

59:45.752 --> 59:47.004
A lady bought one.

59:47.045 --> 59:48.839
It was weapons grade.

59:48.922 --> 59:50.007
I thought it was odd.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.427
- Last piece of the puzzle.

59:57.389 --> 59:59.766
- Holy shit, I'm like
the Lone Gunmen, right?

59:59.808 --> 1:00:01.560
(chuckling)

1:00:02.102 --> 1:00:02.936
There she is.

1:00:05.814 --> 1:00:07.774
Wow, that chick was an alien.

1:00:07.858 --> 1:00:08.942
That's so hot.

1:00:10.485 --> 1:00:11.862
Wow.

1:00:12.029 --> 1:00:14.323
- Do you have any cameras
on the parking lot?

1:00:17.951 --> 1:00:19.286
- That's strange, man.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:27.127
- Well do you have any
other cameras outside?

1:00:29.004 --> 1:00:29.838
- Bam.

1:00:32.007 --> 1:00:33.008
- I'll be darned.

1:00:33.217 --> 1:00:34.051
- She's on foot.

1:00:34.092 --> 1:00:35.093
She can't be that far.

1:00:38.013 --> 1:00:39.097
- Wait.

1:00:39.264 --> 1:00:42.851
You mean these things are
somewhere around here?

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.896
Holy fuckin' awesome sauce.

1:00:46.355 --> 1:00:49.650
- If these creatures got
wind that we were on to them,

1:00:49.691 --> 1:00:52.486
you can't imagine what they could do.

1:00:53.570 --> 1:00:56.156
- Oh, I think I could.

1:00:58.325 --> 1:00:59.993
- Thank you for your cooperation.

1:01:01.036 --> 1:01:04.039
(suspenseful music)

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:30.482
What the heck is an X-File?

1:01:34.862 --> 1:01:37.531
(ominous music)

1:01:38.824 --> 1:01:39.825
Excuse me, ma'am?

1:01:44.621 --> 1:01:46.290
My apologies, ma'am.

1:01:47.249 --> 1:01:50.169
(foreboding music)

1:02:35.130 --> 1:02:37.799
(ominous music)

1:02:45.224 --> 1:02:46.433
- Kid, get lost!

1:02:46.475 --> 1:02:48.185
- Take it, asshole, it's heavy.

1:02:48.227 --> 1:02:50.604
Connect it to the duplexer
and grab me a phone.

1:02:50.646 --> 1:02:51.522
That was Cooper you saw.

1:02:51.563 --> 1:02:53.023
He's getting way too close.

1:02:53.982 --> 1:02:56.652
(ominous music)

1:03:22.469 --> 1:03:24.680
- How far do you think
she could've walked?

1:03:25.264 --> 1:03:26.723
- Not much father than this.

1:03:30.894 --> 1:03:32.479
What are those towers there?

1:03:32.521 --> 1:03:34.273
- LA DWP power station.

1:03:37.734 --> 1:03:38.569
That's it.

1:03:39.570 --> 1:03:40.404
Power.

1:03:40.445 --> 1:03:42.573
- We're right on top of
those little bastards.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:48.495
- Remember what I told you.

1:03:50.247 --> 1:03:51.456
- I'd like to speak to the officer

1:03:51.498 --> 1:03:54.376
in charge of the disappearance
of Doctor Ted Jackson.

1:03:55.460 --> 1:03:57.212
I have important information.

1:03:57.254 --> 1:03:58.881
- You want her commanding officer.

1:03:58.922 --> 1:04:01.175
Tell them these are exigent circumstances.

1:04:01.216 --> 1:04:02.050
- Yes.

1:04:03.051 --> 1:04:04.845
I'll hold for Lieutenant Jenkins.

1:04:08.098 --> 1:04:10.767
(phone ringing)

1:04:11.894 --> 1:04:12.728
- Jenkins.

1:04:14.438 --> 1:04:15.939
- You like it here?

1:04:15.981 --> 1:04:16.982
- LA?

1:04:17.024 --> 1:04:18.483
It's growing on me.

1:04:18.525 --> 1:04:20.110
- Like a fungus?

1:04:20.152 --> 1:04:24.031
No, I mean do you like it here, now?

1:04:24.072 --> 1:04:27.367
- Once I've figured out how
to open a pack of smokes,

1:04:27.409 --> 1:04:28.785
things improved quickly.

1:04:28.827 --> 1:04:30.662
(Lisa chuckling)

1:04:34.917 --> 1:04:36.793
I'm getting worse.

1:04:36.835 --> 1:04:39.588
(dramatic music)

1:04:42.424 --> 1:04:44.301
- Maybe there's a way back.

1:04:44.343 --> 1:04:47.346
- I knew this was a one
way trip when I signed up.

1:04:47.387 --> 1:04:49.640
(coughing)

1:04:54.728 --> 1:04:56.063
Running out of time.

1:04:57.523 --> 1:04:59.733
If something happens,
you have to stop them.

1:05:02.236 --> 1:05:03.070
Promise me.

1:05:06.281 --> 1:05:07.574
- I promise.

1:05:07.616 --> 1:05:10.953
(police siren approaching)

1:05:16.291 --> 1:05:17.376
- [Radio Dispatch] Any available unit.

1:05:17.417 --> 1:05:20.337
Please respond to Seven Henry
Three's last known location.

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:23.257
Alley north of Wilshire, east of Fairfax.

1:05:23.298 --> 1:05:25.801
Possibly in the company
of an armed suspect

1:05:25.843 --> 1:05:27.511
impersonating a Federal Agent.

1:05:30.472 --> 1:05:32.516
- [Radio Officer] Seven
Adam Ten responding.

1:05:33.141 --> 1:05:35.811
- Seven Adam Two, on scene.

1:05:39.857 --> 1:05:41.358
- [Lieutenant] He's a nutcase.

1:05:41.441 --> 1:05:43.861
51-50 all the way.

1:05:43.902 --> 1:05:45.737
Claims to be an Army Officer

1:05:45.779 --> 1:05:47.906
from at secret base in the Mojave.

1:05:47.948 --> 1:05:51.577
Came through time to
track down three aliens.

1:05:51.618 --> 1:05:53.287
- I know how it sounds.

1:05:53.370 --> 1:05:55.664
- He told you and you believed him?

1:05:55.706 --> 1:05:58.083
Tell me I'm hearing things.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:06:00.961
- Look, when that guy grabbed my head,

1:06:01.003 --> 1:06:02.629
I felt something.

1:06:03.881 --> 1:06:05.549
It wasn't natural.

1:06:05.591 --> 1:06:06.425
It wasn't!

1:06:06.466 --> 1:06:09.511
- The guy escaped from an
institution in Seattle.

1:06:09.553 --> 1:06:11.221
They're coming down to pick him up.

1:06:11.263 --> 1:06:12.598
I talked with his doctor.

1:06:12.639 --> 1:06:15.934
- Did you call this doctor
or did this doctor call you?

1:06:15.976 --> 1:06:18.228
Did you even verify his credentials?

1:06:18.270 --> 1:06:20.856
- Christ on a bike, do you hear yourself?

1:06:20.898 --> 1:06:21.732
Go home.

1:06:32.284 --> 1:06:35.037
(dramatic music)

1:08:23.228 --> 1:08:26.481
(dramatic piano music)

1:08:49.463 --> 1:08:51.215
- It's the same stuff.

1:08:59.515 --> 1:09:00.933
Virginia Miller,

1:09:03.936 --> 1:09:04.770
pilot.

1:09:20.118 --> 1:09:22.746
"Virginia Miller, nee Armstrong

1:09:22.788 --> 1:09:25.040
"was killed during a
tragic training accident

1:09:25.082 --> 1:09:29.503
"when her B-17 crashed just
north of Alamogordo Army Airfield.

1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:33.298
"She is survived by her husband, Cooper,

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.716
"and brother...

1:09:37.094 --> 1:09:37.970
"Vernon?"

1:09:39.513 --> 1:09:41.598
You're not in trouble.

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:43.600
- I think we all are.

1:09:43.642 --> 1:09:46.395
(dramatic music)

1:09:56.405 --> 1:09:59.157
- If the Doctor only knew
what he had accomplished here.

1:09:59.199 --> 1:10:00.993
He was definitely on the right path.

1:10:01.994 --> 1:10:03.245
Let's start charging now.

1:10:03.287 --> 1:10:06.456
We should be ready to send
signals around midnight.

1:10:06.498 --> 1:10:09.668
(electrical fizzling)

1:10:14.965 --> 1:10:16.091
- Hey, come in.

1:10:20.762 --> 1:10:22.347
- So how's Vernon doing?

1:10:22.389 --> 1:10:24.224
- He was really restless today.

1:10:24.266 --> 1:10:26.143
He's finally asleep.

1:10:26.185 --> 1:10:28.770
- Has he ever mentioned
a Cooper Miller to you?

1:10:28.812 --> 1:10:29.688
- No.

1:10:29.730 --> 1:10:31.231
- [Vernon] What about Cooper?

1:10:32.983 --> 1:10:36.445
- Hey, Vernon, Detective
McAdams, remember me?

1:10:43.368 --> 1:10:44.203
- You know him.

1:10:45.454 --> 1:10:46.288
Pick him out.

1:11:00.552 --> 1:11:01.386
- Right there.

1:11:05.015 --> 1:11:06.433
- I'll be damned.

1:11:09.311 --> 1:11:11.104
He was a big brother to me.

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:16.568
After my sister's accident,

1:11:17.986 --> 1:11:21.031
he took me to work with him in the Mojave.

1:11:21.073 --> 1:11:22.199
- He thinks you're dead.

1:11:23.617 --> 1:11:24.618
- He's here?

1:11:25.827 --> 1:11:27.579
You know where he is?

1:11:29.039 --> 1:11:30.415
He's a good man.

1:11:31.208 --> 1:11:32.209
Help him.

1:11:32.918 --> 1:11:34.837
You have to stop them.

1:11:42.636 --> 1:11:44.638
(ominous music)

1:11:47.015 --> 1:11:49.059
- Lisa!
(gasping)

1:11:49.101 --> 1:11:50.477
I apologize.

1:11:50.519 --> 1:11:51.353
I was worried about you.

1:11:51.687 --> 1:11:53.397
I heard what happened.

1:11:53.647 --> 1:11:54.773
- How'd you find me?

1:11:57.943 --> 1:11:59.111
- I tracked your phone.

1:12:02.030 --> 1:12:04.241
- You're such an asshole.

1:12:04.283 --> 1:12:05.659
- You should've been done hours ago.

1:12:05.701 --> 1:12:06.952
What are you working on?

1:12:07.619 --> 1:12:09.246
- What's it to you?

1:12:09.288 --> 1:12:10.122
- Everything.

1:12:11.456 --> 1:12:12.291
(thud)

1:12:12.332 --> 1:12:14.835
(eerie music)

1:12:20.132 --> 1:12:21.425
(fizzling)

1:12:21.466 --> 1:12:22.718
(groaning)

1:12:22.885 --> 1:12:23.802
- Salt?

1:12:23.844 --> 1:12:25.429
That won't last long.

1:12:26.471 --> 1:12:28.724
(fizzling)

1:12:31.852 --> 1:12:32.728
(smack)

1:12:34.479 --> 1:12:37.232
(Taser clicking)

1:12:44.531 --> 1:12:47.034
(eerie music)

1:12:54.625 --> 1:12:57.628
(suspenseful music)

1:13:08.347 --> 1:13:10.265
(car speeding away)

1:13:14.478 --> 1:13:15.938
- Where the hell is he?

1:13:16.563 --> 1:13:18.106
- Knowing him,

1:13:18.315 --> 1:13:20.317
enjoying herself.

1:13:24.655 --> 1:13:29.409
(football game on television)

1:13:29.493 --> 1:13:30.744
(doorbell ringing)

1:13:34.248 --> 1:13:36.458
- What the hell happened to you?

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:37.334
Who's that?

1:13:40.087 --> 1:13:41.171
- Cooper's partner.

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:43.382
Cooper's partner from 1951.

1:13:43.423 --> 1:13:44.591
- Has everybody drank the Kool-Aid?

1:13:44.675 --> 1:13:46.969
- Look, Lisa is in deep
shit, we have to find her.

1:13:47.010 --> 1:13:47.970
- Did you call her?

1:13:48.011 --> 1:13:49.721
- My phone is gone, I can't.

1:13:50.764 --> 1:13:51.598
- I'll call her.

1:13:56.228 --> 1:13:57.688
Voicemail.

1:13:57.729 --> 1:13:58.564
- Damn it.

1:14:03.026 --> 1:14:05.529
- Yeah, this is Lieutenant
Jenkins, I need to get --

1:14:05.571 --> 1:14:07.114
I just authorized what?

1:14:10.409 --> 1:14:11.660
- What?

1:14:11.910 --> 1:14:14.496
(somber music)

1:14:25.174 --> 1:14:26.300
- You look sharp.

1:14:27.718 --> 1:14:28.552
- Thanks.

1:14:30.596 --> 1:14:31.513
For trusting me.

1:14:33.015 --> 1:14:34.391
- What can I say?

1:14:34.433 --> 1:14:36.143
I wanted to be right.

1:14:38.353 --> 1:14:39.271
(groaning)

1:14:39.313 --> 1:14:40.147
You okay?

1:14:41.523 --> 1:14:42.774
- I'll be all right.

1:14:42.816 --> 1:14:43.650
- Fine.

1:14:43.692 --> 1:14:45.360
We've gotta go, come on.

1:14:45.402 --> 1:14:48.405
(suspenseful music)

1:14:54.870 --> 1:14:56.330
- Tell me you found them.

1:14:56.371 --> 1:14:57.206
They found me.

1:14:58.373 --> 1:15:00.167
Now we find them.

1:15:03.212 --> 1:15:04.296
- Do you have a plan?

1:15:05.380 --> 1:15:06.673
- They're expecting me.

1:15:26.318 --> 1:15:27.152
Stay.

1:15:28.195 --> 1:15:29.488
You'll blow my cover.

1:15:46.129 --> 1:15:48.799
(ominous music)

1:16:16.034 --> 1:16:18.537
(eerie music)

1:16:53.655 --> 1:16:55.073
It's done.

1:16:55.115 --> 1:16:55.949
- Good.

1:16:57.576 --> 1:16:59.036
That bitch was annoying.

1:17:00.287 --> 1:17:01.496
- Tell me about it.

1:17:05.375 --> 1:17:06.210
- Is it ready?

1:17:08.170 --> 1:17:09.296
- Seven minutes.

1:17:14.051 --> 1:17:16.720
(ominous music)

1:17:19.556 --> 1:17:21.600
Let's connect in case anything happens.

1:17:25.103 --> 1:17:26.063
- Good idea.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:34.863
- Something wrong?

1:17:34.905 --> 1:17:37.908
(suspenseful music)

1:17:41.453 --> 1:17:43.497
(thudding)

1:17:53.382 --> 1:17:55.509
(gunshot)

1:18:09.857 --> 1:18:10.858
- Cooper!

1:18:10.899 --> 1:18:11.859
(thud)

1:18:20.450 --> 1:18:21.535
- Go get her.

1:18:22.744 --> 1:18:25.414
(ominous music)

1:18:46.018 --> 1:18:48.520
(eerie music)

1:18:50.731 --> 1:18:53.066
- Are you going to shoot me?

1:19:01.658 --> 1:19:02.826
- Put them on.

1:19:05.787 --> 1:19:07.831
(humming tune)

1:19:07.873 --> 1:19:10.375
(eerie music)

1:19:17.633 --> 1:19:19.718
- You're gonna shoot a little girl?

1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:23.096
How would you explain that?

1:19:30.062 --> 1:19:31.063
- She's not a child.

1:19:33.607 --> 1:19:34.566
She's a monster.

1:19:34.608 --> 1:19:36.610
- We take her alive.

1:19:36.652 --> 1:19:37.736
- She's already dead.

1:19:39.404 --> 1:19:42.241
(police sirens approaching)

1:19:42.449 --> 1:19:43.408
I'll finish it.

1:19:43.450 --> 1:19:44.618
- No.

1:19:44.660 --> 1:19:45.494
No!

1:19:48.205 --> 1:19:49.248
- Lisa!

1:19:49.289 --> 1:19:50.707
Whoa, whoa, it's me.

1:19:52.751 --> 1:19:54.294
It's me, not one of them.

1:19:56.255 --> 1:19:58.924
(ominous music)

1:20:03.512 --> 1:20:06.265
(Taser clicking)

1:20:06.306 --> 1:20:08.767
- Lieutenant Jenkins, tase her!

1:20:08.809 --> 1:20:09.726
Tom, get in here!

1:20:09.768 --> 1:20:11.311
Tom, get in there!

1:20:11.353 --> 1:20:15.858
(Tasers clicking)

1:20:32.583 --> 1:20:33.959
- What happened?

1:20:36.128 --> 1:20:37.087
The machine!

1:20:38.130 --> 1:20:39.631
- The transmitter!

1:20:39.673 --> 1:20:41.383
Keep an eye on her.

1:20:41.425 --> 1:20:43.343
(suspenseful music)

1:20:43.385 --> 1:20:44.303
- You okay?

1:20:46.930 --> 1:20:49.766
(machine buzzing)

1:20:50.976 --> 1:20:53.979
(suspenseful music)

1:21:16.210 --> 1:21:18.378
(buzzing)

1:21:30.098 --> 1:21:31.058
(gunshot)

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.355
(gunshot)

1:21:36.396 --> 1:21:38.565
(buzzing)

1:21:48.158 --> 1:21:52.996
(gunshots)

1:21:53.330 --> 1:21:55.541
(fizzling)

1:21:59.169 --> 1:22:02.089
(computer beeping)

1:22:09.263 --> 1:22:10.264
You did it.

1:22:12.766 --> 1:22:14.643
(foreboding music)

1:22:14.685 --> 1:22:15.936
- 60 seconds?

1:22:22.943 --> 1:22:23.777
Cooper?

1:22:24.945 --> 1:22:27.531
Get her out of here as fast as you can.

1:22:29.825 --> 1:22:31.451
- It's okay.

1:22:31.493 --> 1:22:34.288
(machine humming)

1:22:44.715 --> 1:22:46.925
(chiming)

1:22:46.967 --> 1:22:49.303
They saw my thoughts. I saw theirs.

1:22:50.304 --> 1:22:52.890
(hopeful music)

1:23:01.315 --> 1:23:02.149
- Vernon?

1:23:03.817 --> 1:23:05.819
- I thought we lost you.

1:23:07.529 --> 1:23:08.363
- Ditto.

1:23:11.867 --> 1:23:13.076
- I missed you.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.371
But it's time to go home.

1:23:21.251 --> 1:23:23.086
He opened the portal for 10 minutes

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:26.089
at 7 AM everyday for a week.

1:23:27.090 --> 1:23:30.010
Had to point a gun at him but
the son of a bitch did it.

1:23:41.313 --> 1:23:44.233
(foreboding music)

1:23:47.194 --> 1:23:49.947
(dramatic music)

1:24:05.629 --> 1:24:07.881
(groaning)

1:24:23.397 --> 1:24:24.231
- Come on!

1:24:33.824 --> 1:24:34.658
Come on.

1:24:35.158 --> 1:24:37.911
(dramatic music)

1:24:44.626 --> 1:24:45.460
Come on.

1:24:50.507 --> 1:24:52.509
(gasping)

1:24:55.012 --> 1:24:57.181
(buzzing)

1:25:13.322 --> 1:25:14.156
Go!

1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:19.828
No, no, no, no, no!

1:25:23.874 --> 1:25:26.126
(groaning)

1:25:31.215 --> 1:25:33.550
(whooshing)

1:25:38.597 --> 1:25:39.932
(thud)

1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:44.269
(sighing)

1:25:56.073 --> 1:25:56.907
Cooper?

1:26:07.626 --> 1:26:09.837
- Welcome to 1951, doll.

1:26:10.254 --> 1:26:12.798
(triumphant music)

1:26:32.401 --> 1:26:33.652
- We'll do everything we can.

1:26:35.988 --> 1:26:37.072
- Is he gonna make it?

1:26:38.407 --> 1:26:39.241
- I don't know.

1:26:39.283 --> 1:26:42.119
No one's ever been in another
time space that long before.

1:26:43.537 --> 1:26:45.581
What I can tell you,
though, is that nothing,

1:26:45.622 --> 1:26:47.124
and I do mean nothing,

1:26:47.165 --> 1:26:49.918
survives outside its own time space.

1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:53.172
So your only chance of
survival is to return

1:26:53.213 --> 1:26:54.298
and I mean quickly.

1:26:55.465 --> 1:26:58.635
Listen, awhile back we
sent an orangutan through.

1:26:58.677 --> 1:27:01.388
Upon his return he survived a couple days

1:27:01.430 --> 1:27:03.974
until he began aging very rapidly.

1:27:05.601 --> 1:27:06.768
- So Cooper's?

1:27:08.687 --> 1:27:10.731
- Well, on the other hand,

1:27:13.692 --> 1:27:15.277
I do have these little fellows.

1:27:16.904 --> 1:27:19.531
(flies buzzing)

1:27:19.573 --> 1:27:21.283
These are my test pilots.

1:27:21.575 --> 1:27:24.703
One journey forward and then back.

1:27:24.745 --> 1:27:25.746
Seven years ago.

1:27:27.372 --> 1:27:29.917
Surely you know the life
expectancy of a fruit fly.

1:27:32.753 --> 1:27:33.921
We need to get you home.

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:42.804
(electrical humming)

1:27:48.602 --> 1:27:50.103
No one else needs to die.

1:27:51.271 --> 1:27:52.314
Cooper will explain.

1:27:58.820 --> 1:28:00.405
Tell Cooper I said

1:28:02.407 --> 1:28:03.242
thank you.

1:28:07.663 --> 1:28:09.915
(fizzling)

1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:16.213
(dramatic music)

1:29:03.302 --> 1:29:04.761
- Figured you might need a ride.

1:29:06.430 --> 1:29:07.264
- You?

1:29:08.724 --> 1:29:10.058
- I've been waiting for 64 years,

1:29:10.100 --> 1:29:11.518
you know I'm not very patient.

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:13.270
- You are so --

1:29:13.312 --> 1:29:15.189
- They figured out what happened
with the fruit flies.

1:29:15.939 --> 1:29:18.609
The longer you stay out of
time, the longer you live.

1:29:22.362 --> 1:29:23.280
You gonna resign?

1:29:24.364 --> 1:29:25.199
- Maybe.

1:29:26.783 --> 1:29:28.202
Why?

1:29:28.243 --> 1:29:29.494
- I know an off book agency

1:29:29.536 --> 1:29:31.872
that could really use
someone with your skills.

1:29:34.333 --> 1:29:35.542
- It's really nice.

1:29:47.596 --> 1:29:49.598
- I figured that typewriter computer thing

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:51.725
might be pretty popular.

1:29:51.767 --> 1:29:53.977
So I invested every penny I had.

1:30:04.571 --> 1:30:07.658
(engine rumbling)

1:30:07.699 --> 1:30:10.410
(exciting music)

1:30:14.998 --> 1:30:15.874
(woosh)

1:30:59.710 --> 1:31:02.254
(somber music)

1:32:01.688 --> 1:32:04.525
(dramatic music)
