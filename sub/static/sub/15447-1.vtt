02:38.055 --> 02:39.355
Good afternoon.

02:39.455 --> 02:42.455
We are now approaching Santorini
and its famous volcano.

02:42.555 --> 02:45.555
Below you can see
the steep, active core...

02:45.655 --> 02:48.655
and the sea-filled crater
named Caldera.

02:48.755 --> 02:50.905
Please fasten your seat belts...

02:50.940 --> 02:53.055
and prepare to land
in Santorini.

03:23.155 --> 03:26.055
Yeah! Welcome.

03:26.155 --> 03:28.255
Cathy and Michael?
The jeep is out front.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.455
I'll get the luggage.

03:30.555 --> 03:33.155
- He's got beautiful eyes.
- Yeah, I know.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.455
Your fiancÃ©?

03:34.555 --> 03:36.120
No. Maybe.

03:36.155 --> 03:39.655
If you wanted romance,
you came to the right place.

03:45.455 --> 03:48.155
- You've been here before.
- That's the whole deal.

03:48.190 --> 03:52.355
Nice-looking girls here.
Try Disco de Unitas.

03:52.390 --> 03:54.220
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

03:54.255 --> 03:57.355
- Hi, Jean.
- Hi. How are you? Where's Roger?

03:57.390 --> 03:59.455
- He got married.
- Oh, that's a shame.

03:59.555 --> 04:03.555
- You are not married, are you?
- Married? No.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.620
Wait, Jean.

04:05.655 --> 04:07.955
This is your world
for the summer.

05:04.855 --> 05:06.020
This is it.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.255
Mostly natives and artists
live out here.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.655
I thought
you'd prefer this to town.

05:10.690 --> 05:13.020
The tourists barely come here.

05:13.055 --> 05:15.055
We will have to walk
the rest of the way.

05:15.090 --> 05:16.355
It's great.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.755
That's the villa.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.220
It's beautiful.

05:25.255 --> 05:28.255
Aspa, it's terrific.
Thanks.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.855
This villa is at the far edge
and has the longest sun.

05:46.890 --> 05:50.855
Plus a wonderful view
of the volcano's core.

05:52.755 --> 05:56.055
Alone at last,
you, me, and the volcano.

05:57.555 --> 05:59.755
- Oh, wow.
- All right.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.955
It looks a bit bare...

06:02.055 --> 06:03.720
but soon you'll have it
fixed to suit you.

06:03.755 --> 06:06.555
Six thousand a week?
Expensive graduation present.

06:06.655 --> 06:09.020
Drachmas.
It's only $100 a week.

06:09.055 --> 06:11.555
I figure we can stay here
eight weeks if we don't eat.

06:11.655 --> 06:13.320
The market's open until nine...

06:13.355 --> 06:14.955
and there you'll find
everything you need...

06:14.990 --> 06:16.655
to set up housekeeping.

06:16.755 --> 06:18.555
It's for you.

06:21.055 --> 06:22.855
I've got to go now.

06:24.555 --> 06:27.155
If you need me, you call me,
but I'm sure you won't need me.

06:27.255 --> 06:29.255
Enjoy your stay. Good-bye.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.522
Thanks a lot, Aspa.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.755
Cathy, come here. Look.

06:37.255 --> 06:39.955
- We're really here.
- We're really here.

06:39.990 --> 06:42.655
I can't tell you
how this place turns me on.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.055
Me, too.

07:15.355 --> 07:16.855
Michael?

07:32.655 --> 07:34.455
Good morning!

07:34.555 --> 07:36.055
It's a great morning.

07:41.355 --> 07:43.355
Don't you feel something?

07:43.390 --> 07:45.955
Yeah. Jet lag.

07:59.955 --> 08:02.355
The birthplace of Apollo.

08:02.455 --> 08:04.820
This is the sanctuary
of Dionysus.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.955
Here's a fertility symbol.
Subtle, isn't it?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.955
- Michael.
- All right.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.255
Come on up here.

08:14.855 --> 08:17.055
Look at this beautiful mosaic.

08:17.155 --> 08:19.055
What are you thinking about?

08:19.090 --> 08:21.655
Time.

08:21.755 --> 08:23.355
It's about two thirty.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.220
No, I meant centuries.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.555
I was thinking
about the guy who made this.

08:27.655 --> 08:33.155
His work is still here
after two thousand years.

08:34.755 --> 08:37.355
What was he thinking
when he chipped right there?

08:37.455 --> 08:39.054
Probably, what was for lunch?

08:42.255 --> 08:43.955
We'll be dust, too,
in a hundred years.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.155
Excuse us.
Do you speak English?

08:46.190 --> 08:47.655
A little. Not so much.

08:47.755 --> 08:49.955
Hi. Joe and Trish Saunders
from Cleveland, Ohio.

08:50.055 --> 08:52.355
- Would you take our picture?
- We're on our honeymoon.

08:52.455 --> 08:53.655
First time in Europe.
How about you?

08:55.955 --> 08:57.255
You two married?

08:57.290 --> 08:58.520
Now, don't blink.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.555
- I never blink.
- You always blink.

09:00.590 --> 09:02.555
- I think I blinked.
- I think I blinked.

09:04.155 --> 09:06.055
This guy from Germany...

09:06.155 --> 09:08.905
told us about this great gorge
in Crete to hike in.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.655
- We love to hike. Do you?
- I do, but he doesn't.

09:11.755 --> 09:13.655
Why don't you both join us
because there's a ferry...

09:13.755 --> 09:15.555
that leaves from the base
of Fira tomorrow at 7:30.

09:15.590 --> 09:17.122
I think it's eight thirty.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.655
No, honey. It's seven thirty.

09:18.755 --> 09:22.155
I brought the schedule.
It's right here. Right there!

09:22.190 --> 09:24.955
Well, anyway, we'd love
to have you join us.

09:38.655 --> 09:41.020
Debbie, I told you
never to leave our sight.

09:41.055 --> 09:43.555
And if I ever catch you again
with those foreign kids...

09:43.590 --> 09:45.555
young lady,
you're grounded permanently.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.155
I feel a little overdressed.

09:52.255 --> 09:54.155
Well, take your top down.

09:54.190 --> 09:55.822
Not today.

09:55.857 --> 09:57.455
Come on.

10:06.855 --> 10:08.855
Look at those caves.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.820
Let's go exploring.

10:10.855 --> 10:12.655
- I think I'll stay here.
- You sure?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.255
We've been going together
almost five years?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.755
Yeah. We've known
each other for ten.

11:40.755 --> 11:42.755
What do you want to do now?

12:49.855 --> 12:52.655
- I got a surprise for you.
- Great.

12:58.555 --> 13:01.555
- It's a darkroom. You like it?
- Are we giving up showers?

13:01.655 --> 13:04.155
You're always telling me
to develop interests of my own.

13:04.255 --> 13:08.555
I know. Keep developing.
I'll pick up some groceries.

14:22.355 --> 14:23.420
Salut.

14:23.455 --> 14:24.655
- Bonjour.
- Tiens.

14:32.155 --> 14:33.955
Which one
should I send my mother?

14:33.990 --> 14:35.755
I don't know.
They're both great.

14:35.855 --> 14:38.355
- When can I take a shower again?
- In the morning?

14:38.390 --> 14:40.822
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

14:40.857 --> 14:43.255
- Coming to bed?
- In a minute.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.455
Race you.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.455
We've been here a week,
and you're skinny-dipping.

15:58.555 --> 16:00.620
You never did that at home.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.155
I used to dream I was a mermaid.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.320
You cheated.

16:03.355 --> 16:05.155
What else did you dream about?

16:05.190 --> 16:06.855
A few things.

16:06.955 --> 16:08.320
Tell me one.

16:08.355 --> 16:09.955
When I was in high school...

16:10.055 --> 16:12.055
I used to fantasize
about being tied up...

16:12.090 --> 16:14.055
and ravaged
by the entire swim team.

16:14.090 --> 16:16.272
The entire swim team?

16:16.307 --> 16:18.455
Maybe not Harvey Scholey.

16:20.655 --> 16:23.655
Everyone always thinks of me
as such a goody two-shoes.

16:23.690 --> 16:26.420
I have desires just like anyone.

16:26.455 --> 16:29.355
Have you ever wanted
to explore them?

16:30.855 --> 16:32.555
No, you satisfy me.

16:34.855 --> 16:37.655
Couldn't you just have
a physical thing with someone?

16:37.690 --> 16:41.255
- I could, but why?
- For variety.

16:41.355 --> 16:44.355
- We can have variety.
- How?

16:53.655 --> 16:57.155
- Now, just relax.
- Relax?

16:57.255 --> 16:59.155
You tied me too tight.
I can't move.

16:59.255 --> 17:01.405
- That's the point.
- Oh. OK.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.297
OK, Cathy, I've had enough.

17:03.332 --> 17:05.155
Come on, Michael, you like it.

17:07.255 --> 17:09.355
I think you actually enjoy
hurting me.

17:09.390 --> 17:11.355
It's not hurting.

17:11.454 --> 17:14.655
It says right here
it's stimulating.

17:14.755 --> 17:17.954
I hope they have a chapter
on first aid in that book.

17:17.990 --> 17:21.155
If I wanted to hurt you,
believe me, you'd know it.

17:21.190 --> 17:24.255
Perhaps I would put
the candle closer.

17:24.355 --> 17:26.454
- Cut it out.
- It would be very hot.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.355
- No.
- Don't you trust me?

17:30.455 --> 17:33.555
Yes, yes, yes, of course
I trust you. I trust you.

17:33.590 --> 17:35.755
You don't seem sure.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.955
Are you afraid
that I might tickle you?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.822
No. No. Not that.

17:39.857 --> 17:41.655
Because I might.

17:51.355 --> 17:53.655
Don't hunch your shoulders.
You have beautiful tits.

17:53.755 --> 17:57.155
Pull'em back. That's better.
I'm gonna mail these in Fira.

17:57.190 --> 17:58.555
Oh, take this one.

18:00.155 --> 18:01.955
Your mother. What'd you say?

18:02.055 --> 18:04.005
Send candles.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.955
Very funny.

18:06.055 --> 18:08.320
Stop reading those books.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.155
I'm afraid of what
I'll come home to.

18:41.255 --> 18:43.355
- Where you going?
- The beach.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.422
I'll drive you.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.455
I prefer the bus.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.455
What is it you like about this?

18:52.555 --> 18:53.755
I like people.

18:56.855 --> 18:59.155
I've seen you several times now.

18:59.190 --> 19:01.272
You've been rather obvious.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.355
Sorry. Does it bother you?

19:05.155 --> 19:07.455
- What's your name?
- Lina.

19:07.555 --> 19:09.355
I'm Michael. Michael Pappas.

19:12.855 --> 19:14.320
Where you from?

19:14.355 --> 19:16.555
Do you want to know my sign?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.655
- Not particularly.
- Good.

19:19.690 --> 19:22.322
That's a pretty camera.

19:22.357 --> 19:24.955
Can I-
take a picture?

20:11.555 --> 20:13.155
What about the sign?

20:49.555 --> 20:51.655
What's that?

20:51.755 --> 20:53.955
What?

20:53.990 --> 20:56.155
Oh, that.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.820
It's nothing.

20:57.855 --> 20:59.355
See? It comes right off.

20:59.390 --> 21:02.155
It's nothing.

21:07.255 --> 21:09.855
So, Lina...

21:09.955 --> 21:11.055
what do you do?

21:11.090 --> 21:13.355
Why?

21:13.455 --> 21:15.355
I'm just trying
to get to know you better.

21:16.655 --> 21:18.955
So the most important thing
to know about me...

21:18.990 --> 21:20.655
is I hate questions.

23:35.855 --> 23:37.355
There you are.

23:44.355 --> 23:46.555
- Something wrong?
- No.

23:48.655 --> 23:51.855
I just want
to be alone for a while.

23:51.955 --> 23:55.855
You were alone all day, Michael.
What's the matter?

23:55.890 --> 23:57.755
Nothin'. Nothin'.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.205
It's too complicated.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.655
What's too complicated?

24:04.755 --> 24:07.355
Let's talk about it later.

24:13.755 --> 24:16.305
Michael,
I'm doing the best I can.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.855
Look. I've even got
my shoulders back.

24:25.355 --> 24:27.620
Tell me. Maybe I can help.

24:27.655 --> 24:30.255
Look, I'm just confused
about a few things...

24:30.355 --> 24:34.255
and I just need some time alone
to sort it all out.

24:34.355 --> 24:36.655
We're here together, Michael.
You asked me to come.

24:36.690 --> 24:39.572
I know, I know. It's not you.

24:39.607 --> 24:42.455
It's me. It's this island.

24:42.555 --> 24:45.955
Everything in my life till now
has been planned for me-

24:46.055 --> 24:48.320
school, college...

24:48.355 --> 24:50.255
when dad was alive,
working every summer...

24:50.290 --> 24:52.055
to learn the business.

24:54.055 --> 24:56.755
It's the first time in my life
I can do what I want to do.

24:56.790 --> 24:58.055
You can do what you want.

25:02.255 --> 25:05.055
I was with another girl
this afternoon.

25:16.655 --> 25:18.555
I'm going through something here
I don't understand.

25:20.755 --> 25:23.055
It's not 'cause I don't love you
'cause I do love you.

25:25.155 --> 25:26.655
I don't know.

25:26.755 --> 25:29.255
Maybe it was a mistake
to come here.

25:31.155 --> 25:34.355
Maybe it was a mistake
to come here?

25:34.390 --> 25:36.855
You're the mistake, Michael.

25:40.355 --> 25:43.655
You do what you have to do.
Get it out of your system.

25:43.690 --> 25:45.055
I'm going out.

25:49.355 --> 25:51.255
You stink. You know that?

25:53.355 --> 25:55.555
Yeah, I know that.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.455
American?

26:40.555 --> 26:41.955
How'd you guess?

26:42.055 --> 26:44.355
Can I sit down for a minute?

26:44.390 --> 26:46.155
- Sure.
- My name's Bob.

26:46.190 --> 26:47.455
What's your name?

26:53.955 --> 26:56.255
Have you been
on many of the islands?

26:56.355 --> 26:59.155
- A couple.
- Which one is your favorite?

27:01.055 --> 27:02.255
Santorini.

27:23.855 --> 27:26.120
In Greek you say koli spera.

27:26.155 --> 27:29.255
Do you have any other phrases
you'd like me to translate?

27:29.355 --> 27:31.055
None that come to mind.

27:32.655 --> 27:35.255
Listen, I'd love
to treat you to a souvlaki.

27:35.355 --> 27:37.655
Thanks, but I think
I'll take a rain check.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.255
How about breakfast
tomorrow morning?

27:39.355 --> 27:41.255
No. I don't think so.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.155
Yeah, sure. No problem.

27:46.555 --> 27:48.455
Hi. I'm Yorghos.

27:48.555 --> 27:52.355
I can tell you haven't yet seen
the real la.

27:53.555 --> 27:54.805
I guess not.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.055
Come on.

28:11.055 --> 28:13.555
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

28:16.155 --> 28:19.255
Making love to you
is like riding a horse.

28:23.155 --> 28:26.255
I only meant
the way you respond.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.455
You're very affectionate.

28:30.155 --> 28:33.205
You must be very loved by her.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.255
- Her?
- The girl you live with.

28:36.355 --> 28:39.155
I can see both of you
from here, too, you know.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.255
Does she know you're here?

28:45.955 --> 28:50.255
- What's her name?
- Cathy.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.955
She's very lovely.

28:53.055 --> 28:55.855
Yes, she is.

28:57.155 --> 29:01.155
You know, it's not often
one finds people...

29:01.190 --> 29:02.555
who truly care about each other.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.055
Sit down.

29:38.455 --> 29:41.155
Do you want cocaine? Quaaludes?

29:41.255 --> 29:42.755
No, thanks.

29:44.655 --> 29:46.655
How about some wine?

29:46.690 --> 29:48.655
Yeah, that'd be nice.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.455
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:37.855 --> 30:39.555
You must've seen
a lot of movies.

30:39.655 --> 30:43.020
No, we haven't got
a theater here.

30:43.055 --> 30:45.555
My father has a television
in his shop.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.355
Sorry.

30:57.955 --> 30:59.755
Americans.

31:02.355 --> 31:04.455
Where do you go every day?

31:04.555 --> 31:07.020
That's a personal question.

31:07.055 --> 31:11.055
A personal question?
We made love three times today.

31:11.090 --> 31:12.520
"Made love"?

31:12.555 --> 31:14.555
I'd say we screwed.

31:16.555 --> 31:18.155
When can we get together again?

31:18.255 --> 31:19.755
What about Cathy?

31:22.155 --> 31:24.155
We have an open relationship.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.155
- You're up.
- Morning.

31:31.255 --> 31:34.755
Morning? It's only, uh-
it is morning.

31:36.555 --> 31:38.155
God damn you!

31:38.255 --> 31:40.255
You told me
to get it out of my system.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.055
Well, I thought
I could handle it.

31:43.955 --> 31:46.755
I wish I could, but I can't.

31:46.855 --> 31:50.255
My attraction to Lina doesn't
change my feelings for you.

31:53.155 --> 31:55.205
So, how many times did you come?

31:55.240 --> 31:57.147
What are you
talking like that for?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.020
Oh, I know. Goody-goody Cathy...

31:59.055 --> 32:02.155
doesn't say things like that,
right? Fuck you, Michael.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.255
It wasn't the fireworks
you imagine.

32:07.355 --> 32:09.720
Too bad.

32:09.755 --> 32:10.955
I'm not lying.

32:12.755 --> 32:15.455
Tell me, Michael,
is Lina the first?

32:15.490 --> 32:18.155
I've never cheated on you
before.

32:18.255 --> 32:20.155
- Never?
- Never.

32:23.055 --> 32:26.820
Maybe you'd just like me
to take off, go home.

32:26.855 --> 32:29.755
That's what you want, isn't it,
so you can be with Lina?

32:34.155 --> 32:36.055
I want to be with you.

32:44.855 --> 32:48.855
So, what'd you do last night?

32:48.890 --> 32:50.855
Went to the Kiklos CafÃ©.

32:52.255 --> 32:54.155
I met a Greek boy.

33:55.255 --> 33:57.320
You know me?

33:57.355 --> 33:59.955
Well, I know who you are.

34:01.755 --> 34:04.255
I was just fixing some tea.
Would you like some?

34:11.355 --> 34:14.554
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.

34:25.455 --> 34:27.554
You have a lot of books
on archeology.

34:27.655 --> 34:28.755
I'm an archeologist.

34:47.155 --> 34:48.755
Have a seat.

34:57.555 --> 34:59.955
- Lemon?
- No, thanks.

35:00.055 --> 35:03.055
- Sugar?
- Mm-mmm.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.155
You did want tea?

35:07.190 --> 35:08.555
Sure.

35:18.355 --> 35:20.355
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.

35:20.390 --> 35:23.420
No, no, no. Stay.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.155
I don't know why I came.

35:25.255 --> 35:28.655
I think I do.

35:28.755 --> 35:30.755
And first
I want you to know something.

35:30.855 --> 35:34.755
I'm not trying to steal Michael
away from you.

35:34.855 --> 35:36.855
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

35:36.890 --> 35:38.155
And he's with you.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.155
Anyway, I don't want
to deal anymore...

35:43.190 --> 35:45.755
with ego problems
and jealousies.

35:45.790 --> 35:47.955
You've never been jealous?

35:48.055 --> 35:50.455
"Jealousy doesn't show
how much you love someone.

35:50.490 --> 35:53.455
"It shows how insecure you are. "

35:53.490 --> 35:54.855
Margaret Mead.

35:54.955 --> 35:57.155
I think I have
that book here somewhere.

36:02.355 --> 36:06.655
Anyway, I came to la
to get away from everything.

36:06.755 --> 36:09.355
And I won't
be seeing Michael again.

36:09.390 --> 36:11.155
I'm not asking that.

36:15.355 --> 36:17.755
I came here
to simplify my life.

36:17.855 --> 36:18.955
Why?

36:24.355 --> 36:26.055
C'est une longue histoire.

36:27.655 --> 36:29.555
I mean, it's a long story.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.355
I'd like to hear it.

36:34.955 --> 36:36.855
I think I need a cigarette.

36:41.055 --> 36:45.355
- Are you finished with that?
- Sure. Help yourself.

36:45.390 --> 36:47.355
You're hungry. That's good.

36:50.555 --> 36:53.605
- She's very interesting.
- Who?

36:53.640 --> 36:56.655
- Lina.
- Lina? You met her? Where?

36:56.690 --> 36:58.220
I went to her house.

36:58.255 --> 37:00.155
What did you do that for?
What happened?

37:00.255 --> 37:02.705
- Nothing.
- What did she say?

37:02.740 --> 37:05.155
We talked about a lot of things.

37:05.255 --> 37:07.455
Excuse me. Can I have
some more ice cream?

37:07.555 --> 37:09.455
Cathy, like what?

37:09.555 --> 37:11.555
Do you know anything
about her past?

37:14.655 --> 37:16.020
She hasn't told you anything?

37:16.055 --> 37:18.955
She doesn't like
to talk about herself.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.520
Let's see...

37:21.555 --> 37:23.720
she's from Deauville.

37:23.755 --> 37:26.155
And then she moved to Paris,
where she got her degree.

37:26.190 --> 37:27.655
And then she lived
with an older married man...

37:27.690 --> 37:29.420
in Rome for a while.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.555
- C'est une longue histoire.
- C'est une what?

37:32.655 --> 37:35.855
It is easier
knowing who you're with.

37:38.355 --> 37:39.655
Thanks.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.455
You amaze me.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.720
I amaze myself sometimes.

37:45.755 --> 37:47.755
Anyway, we're going
to see her tomorrow.

37:47.855 --> 37:49.820
"We"?

37:49.855 --> 37:52.655
She's invited us to Akrotiri,
where she works.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.220
Lina works.

37:56.255 --> 37:58.555
You don't know much about her,
do you?

38:00.255 --> 38:04.455
So, when are we supposed
to see her?

38:04.490 --> 38:06.120
I told you, tomorrow.

38:06.155 --> 38:09.705
The eruption of the volcano
in the late bronze age...

38:09.740 --> 38:13.255
buried this island beneath
a thick layer of lava ash.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.122
Our excavation
exposes this town...

38:16.157 --> 38:19.356
for the first time
since 1500 B.C.

38:19.391 --> 38:22.555
That explosion
shattered Santorini...

38:22.655 --> 38:23.755
There she is.

38:45.555 --> 38:46.755
Follow me.

38:56.555 --> 38:59.955
This street is from the Minoan
level of the excavation.

39:00.055 --> 39:02.555
It's the deepest
we've dug so far.

39:02.655 --> 39:04.805
Is this your first
excavation job?

39:04.840 --> 39:06.955
She worked outside of Rome
last year.

39:06.990 --> 39:08.320
Look at this.

39:08.355 --> 39:10.455
Every time I come upon
something this beautiful...

39:10.490 --> 39:11.620
I wonder to myself...

39:11.655 --> 39:14.655
"Who formed this?
What was he like?"

39:14.690 --> 39:17.072
I'd like to show you
some more around...

39:17.107 --> 39:19.455
and maybe we can have lunch
at the beach.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.620
Let's.

39:20.655 --> 39:23.320
- My favorite one is Perissa.
- Which one is that?

39:23.355 --> 39:25.955
You know, the one we went to
that has the tiny pebbles.

39:30.655 --> 39:33.655
This was a hand mill.
Part of the delta houses.

39:33.755 --> 39:35.720
There were very beautiful
wall paintings...

39:35.755 --> 39:38.855
but now everything is in Athens
in the museum...

39:38.890 --> 39:40.455
unfortunately.

40:12.355 --> 40:13.555
Who took these?

40:15.255 --> 40:17.705
- I like them.
- Thanks.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.797
I wish I could take photos.

40:19.832 --> 40:21.820
I find incredible objects...

40:21.855 --> 40:23.955
laid out exactly
the way they were placed...

40:24.055 --> 40:25.620
thousands of years ago.

40:25.655 --> 40:28.955
Well, maybe Cathy
can shoot some for you.

40:54.655 --> 40:57.755
This afternoon, when you two
went in opposite directions...

41:02.155 --> 41:04.455
I wanted to follow both of you.

41:08.755 --> 41:10.255
People are like gas.

41:10.290 --> 41:11.755
I beg your pardon?

41:11.855 --> 41:14.955
I mean, gas fills
whatever space it's in...

41:14.990 --> 41:16.820
and people do, too.

41:16.855 --> 41:19.155
They expand to fit the space.

41:20.755 --> 41:25.555
I think I'll expand
into the kitchen and fix dinner.

41:31.655 --> 41:35.155
When there is not enough space,
there is pressure.

41:40.555 --> 41:41.855
People are like gas?

41:43.355 --> 41:45.605
She thought it'd be better
if she didn't stay.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.855
- How perceptive of her.
- You invited her here.

41:50.655 --> 41:52.155
I know.

42:02.155 --> 42:03.855
I like her...

42:05.555 --> 42:07.655
but when I see you with her...

42:25.355 --> 42:26.555
What now?

43:27.555 --> 43:29.755
- Looks real nice.
- You really like it?

43:29.855 --> 43:32.055
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Cathy.

43:32.155 --> 43:34.655
- Would you like to have a drink?
- Sure.

43:34.690 --> 43:36.255
You know Lina, don't you?

43:37.555 --> 43:41.855
Hi. Yeah, she came to visit me
in Akrotiri the other day.

43:44.755 --> 43:46.055
Good drawing.

43:50.455 --> 43:51.655
It's really nice.

43:51.690 --> 43:53.055
Thank you.

43:54.955 --> 43:56.655
I saw Lina yesterday.

43:56.755 --> 43:58.755
Told her I might take
some pictures for her.

43:58.855 --> 44:01.655
In Akrotiri? That'll be great.

44:01.690 --> 44:04.120
I told you I like her.

44:04.155 --> 44:09.455
This is an anchor, but we don't
know how big the boat was.

44:09.555 --> 44:12.255
Now I'd like to take a picture
of these steps here.

44:12.355 --> 44:14.955
Each step was made
out of a single stone.

44:15.055 --> 44:16.255
All the Greek gods...

44:16.355 --> 44:18.255
they wore disguises
and all kinds of things...

44:18.355 --> 44:21.255
and Dionysus would have been
disguised into a woman...

44:21.290 --> 44:22.655
to deceive his enemy.

44:24.255 --> 44:28.855
So, well, he was the first
transvestite of the world.

44:32.155 --> 44:33.555
Where are we going?

44:33.655 --> 44:35.355
To Mykonos on a yacht.

44:35.455 --> 44:37.155
Some friends
I haven't seen for years...

44:37.190 --> 44:38.755
are making a movie there...

44:38.855 --> 44:41.555
and I thought it would be fun
or at least colorful.

44:54.655 --> 44:56.155
Monica!

44:58.155 --> 45:00.655
Come on!
You look beautiful today!

45:09.555 --> 45:12.855
Andreas! Andreas, darling!
Look who's here!

45:12.890 --> 45:14.855
- Lina!
- Andreas!

45:14.955 --> 45:16.020
You're back!

45:16.055 --> 45:18.655
We're about to head for Mykonos.

45:18.755 --> 45:20.455
Welcome to the Colossus.

45:21.755 --> 45:24.055
At last, some fresh faces.

45:24.155 --> 45:26.155
This party could use
some stimulation.

45:26.255 --> 45:27.855
Cosmo, I want you
to meet some friends.

45:27.955 --> 45:29.055
This is Cathy and Michael.

45:29.155 --> 45:30.955
- How do you do?
- Better, thank you.

45:30.990 --> 45:32.755
Cosmo, stop it!
Back in your cage!

45:32.855 --> 45:36.055
- Maybe you wanna go with me?
- Back to your cage!

45:40.455 --> 45:41.855
Unusual group.

45:45.955 --> 45:48.620
More ice, please.

45:48.655 --> 45:50.020
Since I gave up tarot cards...

45:50.055 --> 45:52.455
I've been getting very accurate
fortune cookies.

45:56.255 --> 45:57.555
Hello, dear.

46:04.055 --> 46:07.755
Cathy, come and steer
the Colossus.

46:07.790 --> 46:09.755
Feel her power.

46:11.955 --> 46:13.555
So there you are.

46:13.655 --> 46:16.155
I was just about to get a drink.

46:18.155 --> 46:20.355
Jonathan,
I want you to meet with Mike.

46:20.455 --> 46:21.920
He's an American, too.

46:21.955 --> 46:23.455
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

46:23.555 --> 46:24.655
Michael Pappas.

46:28.255 --> 46:31.055
- Connecticut.
- I see you've met my husband.

46:31.155 --> 46:33.055
You see the cove there?

46:44.655 --> 46:46.155
Oh, Cathy,
can I talk to you a second?

46:46.190 --> 46:47.355
Sure.

46:50.155 --> 46:53.055
I'm sorry. This is not exactly
what I was expecting.

46:53.090 --> 46:54.955
No one's gonna believe
my photos.

46:56.255 --> 46:59.755
Oh, my God. You're gonna have
a strange impression of me now.

46:59.855 --> 47:01.420
I'm having a great time.

47:01.455 --> 47:04.855
You know, when I was young,
this was like a circus for me.

47:04.890 --> 47:07.155
- It hasn't changed much.
- Michael.

47:08.655 --> 47:11.355
You told us
it was going to be colorful.

47:11.455 --> 47:12.655
You didn't say day-glo.

47:13.655 --> 47:15.555
Hey, it's a party.

47:17.555 --> 47:18.655
Let's drink.

47:18.755 --> 47:21.820
"Jet Set" playback take 1.

47:21.855 --> 47:23.755
Here is the surprise
I promised to you.

48:07.255 --> 48:09.355
It'll be good
to be on sane land again.

48:09.390 --> 48:10.655
Watch out.

48:21.855 --> 48:23.355
Oh, what a day.

48:23.390 --> 48:24.755
Some wine?

48:24.855 --> 48:26.755
No, thanks.

48:26.855 --> 48:29.055
We'll all be dust
in a hundred years.

48:29.090 --> 48:32.255
Has anyone seen my camera strap?

48:32.355 --> 48:33.820
My pants were falling down...

48:33.855 --> 48:36.955
and I needed protection
from Cosmo. You want it?

48:38.255 --> 48:39.355
Well, come and get it.

48:39.390 --> 48:40.555
- OK.
- Come on.

48:58.255 --> 48:59.855
Well, I'll go now.

48:59.955 --> 49:01.455
The party's not over.

49:02.655 --> 49:04.055
Will you say good night for me?

49:06.955 --> 49:08.555
Sure.

49:12.955 --> 49:13.920
Where is Lina?

49:13.955 --> 49:15.855
- She went home.
- Why?

49:15.890 --> 49:17.972
Because she was tired.

49:18.007 --> 49:20.055
- Are you tired?
- No.

49:23.655 --> 49:25.255
I wanna take a shower!

49:25.290 --> 49:26.820
Michael, if you do-

49:26.855 --> 49:29.155
Thanks for getting
in the shower with me.

49:49.555 --> 49:52.655
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

49:52.690 --> 49:54.520
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

49:54.555 --> 49:57.355
- What's this?
- It's a waterbed.

49:57.390 --> 49:59.555
Oh, God.

50:11.055 --> 50:13.055
Look,
the paintings from Akrotiri.

50:13.155 --> 50:15.655
I love it. It suits you.

50:19.355 --> 50:21.255
- Whoa! The Three Stooges!
- Not again.

50:21.290 --> 50:23.355
- Who are they?
- Come on.

50:28.255 --> 50:30.655
One, two, three.

50:32.755 --> 50:34.955
- Leave him alone.
- I'm quittin'.

50:35.055 --> 50:36.255
Put up your hands.

50:38.155 --> 50:40.655
Listen, ape... there.

50:40.755 --> 50:43.155
- What's the matter?
- Why don't you leave him alone?

50:43.255 --> 50:45.355
I'm not dancing.

50:45.455 --> 50:47.655
Hey, put your hand on your ear.

50:47.755 --> 50:50.555
Here's a dance
that's most popular in society.

50:50.590 --> 50:52.055
You'll never go amiss
doing this.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.355
Do exactly what I do.

50:56.855 --> 50:58.355
Well, get started.

51:38.055 --> 51:41.855
You know the other day when
I brought you the breakfast?

51:41.955 --> 51:44.955
Seeing you and Michael
together...

51:44.990 --> 51:46.655
it moved me.

51:46.755 --> 51:48.255
It did?

51:48.355 --> 51:51.055
I don't think I could see
you and Michael in bed together.

51:51.155 --> 51:53.405
Oh, you could.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.655
I don't know.

51:55.755 --> 51:58.205
At first I was jealous.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.655
Well, what about now?

52:12.155 --> 52:13.455
We could use a man right now.

52:13.555 --> 52:14.755
Just saying good-bye to people,
you know?

52:14.855 --> 52:16.055
But you're always saying hello.

52:19.655 --> 52:20.820
Amazing perception...

52:20.855 --> 52:23.455
that I was inside the head
of this huge giant...

52:23.490 --> 52:25.255
and there were
all these technicians...

52:25.355 --> 52:28.655
working at this big panel
inside his brain...

52:28.755 --> 52:30.120
and they were facing...

52:30.155 --> 52:33.355
those enormous, huge
picture windows...

52:33.390 --> 52:35.055
which were his eyes.

52:36.455 --> 52:38.720
Did you know that fire exists...

52:38.755 --> 52:41.355
only if each
of three elements are present?

52:41.455 --> 52:45.155
Heat, fuel, oxygen.

52:45.190 --> 52:47.822
Lose one, it goes out.

52:47.857 --> 52:50.455
Where did you learn that?

52:50.555 --> 52:52.920
Boy scouts. Where else?

52:52.955 --> 52:57.555
Faster and faster and faster!

52:57.590 --> 52:59.220
Then what happened?

52:59.255 --> 53:02.255
I sat down.
I decided to give it a rest.

53:02.355 --> 53:04.155
Do you want some wine?
I'll get some more wine, OK?

53:04.255 --> 53:06.355
Yeah, get some wine.
That'll be great.

53:12.355 --> 53:14.755
Hey, Dimitri, got a new lover?

53:28.055 --> 53:29.705
Want a joint?

53:29.740 --> 53:31.355
No, thanks.

53:33.555 --> 53:36.155
- Come on.
- No. I'm going back.

53:36.190 --> 53:38.555
Hey, what's wrong?
Sorry.

53:45.855 --> 53:47.055
Brava.

53:48.255 --> 53:50.055
Would you like to take a walk?

53:50.090 --> 53:51.655
We're together.

53:51.755 --> 53:54.455
Well, I can find someone
for her.

53:54.555 --> 53:57.055
How about him, there?
The guy in the blue sweater.

53:58.355 --> 53:59.955
- That would work.
- Yeah?

54:00.055 --> 54:03.055
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

54:05.355 --> 54:07.555
Let's go.

54:07.655 --> 54:09.955
I think the girl on the left
there quite fancies you.

54:09.990 --> 54:12.255
Do you see her? The one
on the left there with Ann.

54:12.290 --> 54:13.920
He's handsome.

54:13.955 --> 54:15.255
It's been
sort of a lonely night.

54:15.355 --> 54:17.805
- Are you alone?
- Uh-uh.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.255
- Then who are you with?
- Him.

54:20.290 --> 54:22.955
- With him?
- I mean, them.

54:22.990 --> 54:24.455
Them.

54:32.255 --> 54:33.820
Is he going to dive?

54:33.855 --> 54:36.155
- He's going to jump.
- How do you know?

54:36.255 --> 54:38.220
He always jumps.

54:38.255 --> 54:40.855
Now he'll pace
back and forth...

54:40.890 --> 54:42.720
stop...

54:42.755 --> 54:44.455
more pacing...

54:46.155 --> 54:47.720
stop...

54:47.755 --> 54:50.355
up and down on his toes...

54:50.390 --> 54:52.955
cover his balls and jump.

54:58.955 --> 55:00.855
He dove.

55:00.955 --> 55:03.055
My God.
You'd never catch me doing that.

55:04.855 --> 55:06.755
I'm terrified of heights.

55:08.455 --> 55:10.255
Have you ever seen him cry?

55:10.355 --> 55:12.305
He cried when his father died.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.255
I'd like to see
that side of him.

55:21.455 --> 55:23.855
Your shoulders are getting red.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.855
Put some sunblock.

55:29.855 --> 55:31.155
Have you always had short hair?

55:31.255 --> 55:33.420
I cut mine
after I broke with Maro.

55:33.455 --> 55:36.455
I always cut my hair
when I need a change.

55:36.555 --> 55:38.055
Maybe I'll cut mine.

55:38.090 --> 55:39.520
Do you need a change?

55:39.555 --> 55:42.755
I still look like I did
when I was twelve.

55:44.355 --> 55:46.955
I thought I wanted to look
like a little girl forever.

55:47.055 --> 55:49.355
It didn't work.

55:54.655 --> 55:57.055
- Where do your parents live?
- I don't know.

55:58.255 --> 56:01.555
When I was fifteen,
my parents fired me.

56:01.590 --> 56:03.255
Fired you?

56:03.355 --> 56:04.820
Well, they told me
to leave home...

56:04.855 --> 56:08.020
and then I met Monica,
and she let me stay with her.

56:08.055 --> 56:12.255
My mother's just the opposite.
She never let me leave home.

56:12.355 --> 56:14.255
She didn't want me
to live with Michael.

56:14.355 --> 56:16.320
She didn't even want me
to come to Greece.

56:16.355 --> 56:20.055
I guess it's not so bad to have
someone who cares for you.

56:20.090 --> 56:22.920
I guess.

56:22.955 --> 56:25.120
Was Maro a good lover?

56:25.155 --> 56:27.355
I don't want to talk about Maro.

56:27.455 --> 56:29.620
You've had so many adventures.

56:29.655 --> 56:31.955
I've often wondered what
a life like that would be like.

56:31.990 --> 56:35.020
- Like what?
- Free, open.

56:35.055 --> 56:37.155
Well, it's easier to say
than to do.

56:37.255 --> 56:39.455
But if you're somewhat secure
with yourself...

56:39.555 --> 56:42.255
you can experiment
anything you want.

56:42.355 --> 56:45.105
I guess
I'm afraid of being hurt.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.820
But it's just like exercising.

56:47.855 --> 56:51.255
It can hurt at first,
but then it becomes a pleasure.

56:51.290 --> 56:53.720
Then I worry
about the consequences.

56:53.755 --> 56:56.455
- What consequences?
- What would my parents think?

56:56.490 --> 56:58.755
What would Michael think?
What would I think?

56:58.790 --> 56:59.955
Stop thinking so much.

57:02.155 --> 57:03.455
They're great.

57:03.555 --> 57:04.955
You know, if you live
on the rim of a volcano...

57:05.055 --> 57:08.855
that could blow up at any time,
you are taking a chance.

57:08.955 --> 57:12.955
I think if you want to feel
alive, you must take risks.

57:13.055 --> 57:14.855
I'm beginning to see that.

57:51.055 --> 57:52.255
Go on.

58:13.155 --> 58:14.355
Try again.

01:01:37.555 --> 01:01:39.655
Are you OK?

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.755
Fine. Why?

01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:43.955
I mean, about...

01:01:44.055 --> 01:01:47.855
I've never been in the same bed
with a woman before.

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.820
I know.

01:01:49.855 --> 01:01:51.655
We shared you.

01:01:51.755 --> 01:01:54.755
I know. Are you OK?

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.755
I'm fine, Michael.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.455
Good morning.

01:02:24.555 --> 01:02:25.755
Come on.

01:02:29.655 --> 01:02:31.155
Is that OK?

01:02:45.755 --> 01:02:46.955
What's going on?

01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:32.655
I'm starving.

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:34.355
I'll get Michael.

01:04:46.255 --> 01:04:48.055
What do you think?
Too much sun?

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.655
Yeah. Too much sun.

01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:20.755
Who left their bathing suit
in the sink?

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:21.920
I always leave mine outside.

01:06:21.955 --> 01:06:24.520
Well, I know it's not mine.
Lina?

01:06:24.555 --> 01:06:26.955
Yeah, it's mine. Could you
put it outside, please?

01:06:27.055 --> 01:06:29.355
- I'll be glad to.
- Thank you.

01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:35.420
Relax, Michael.

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:36.820
I can't live like this!

01:06:36.855 --> 01:06:40.155
- Don't get so uptight.
- Well, look at this place!

01:06:41.755 --> 01:06:45.655
Maybe we should divide up
some of the chores around here.

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:47.455
Great.
Why don't you make dinner?

01:06:48.955 --> 01:06:51.420
All right. I will.

01:06:51.455 --> 01:06:53.755
Great.
Then I'll clean up the house.

01:06:57.055 --> 01:07:00.255
Cathy, could you come here
a minute, please?

01:07:06.755 --> 01:07:08.720
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.

01:07:08.755 --> 01:07:10.355
Well, you always
kept the place spotless.

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:11.455
Why should I do everything?

01:07:11.555 --> 01:07:13.155
I like your idea
of dividing up the chores.

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:15.020
But there's other things.

01:07:15.055 --> 01:07:17.155
Your photographic chemicals
smell up the place...

01:07:17.255 --> 01:07:18.755
you've been using
my razor again-

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.255
How do you know it was me?

01:07:20.355 --> 01:07:22.355
And what about you always
leaving the toilet seat up?

01:08:05.155 --> 01:08:06.955
Michael, did you do this
on purpose?

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:13.255
I think he deserves
his present for this.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.655
He certainly does.

01:08:16.154 --> 01:08:17.354
What's this?

01:08:17.455 --> 01:08:19.854
It's an inspirational gift
from an ancient religion...

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:23.255
to deal with
the eternal battle of sexes.

01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:36.654
It's a perfect likeness,
but I can't play the flute.

01:08:36.689 --> 01:08:39.455
- Let's go dancing.
- Let's stay home tonight.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.354
- I want to go, too.
- Yeah, let's go.

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.455
OK, we'll go.

01:08:42.555 --> 01:08:44.755
Good night, Michael.
See you later.

01:09:23.955 --> 01:09:25.755
It's finished.

01:09:27.854 --> 01:09:29.654
Whoa. It's a tit.

01:09:29.755 --> 01:09:32.404
No. It's an aerial view
of Santorini.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:35.055
There's la and Fira,
and that's the core.

01:09:35.154 --> 01:09:38.455
I'm sorry. I must admit
I thought it was a tit, too.

01:09:38.555 --> 01:09:40.354
You two have sex on the brain.

01:09:40.455 --> 01:09:44.154
And why not,
with this beauty everywhere?

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:47.354
Have you ever slept with a man?

01:09:47.455 --> 01:09:48.654
I've been close to men before.

01:09:48.755 --> 01:09:51.654
Don't pursue it.
Life is complicated enough.

01:10:20.255 --> 01:10:22.155
- Just relax.
- God!

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.655
Where does it hurt?

01:10:27.755 --> 01:10:28.820
I'm OK.

01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:31.255
You sure scared us
for a little sprain.

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:33.655
- It's not serious.
- No, of course not.

01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:37.420
How do you feel?

01:10:37.455 --> 01:10:41.355
Fine, but it's my first
and last time on a moped.

01:10:48.955 --> 01:10:51.855
When I was a little girl,
I thought all Americans...

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:55.355
were carrying guns
and wearing cowboy hats.

01:11:17.355 --> 01:11:20.255
Happy birthday, dear Lina

01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:23.022
Happy birthday, dear friend

01:11:23.057 --> 01:11:25.755
Our love will grow stronger

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.655
And it never will end

01:11:28.755 --> 01:11:32.055
You're another year older

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.355
Over the hill

01:11:34.455 --> 01:11:37.955
So we threw you a party

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:41.455
And we'll send you the bill

01:11:41.555 --> 01:11:43.155
Bon anniversaire!

01:11:45.255 --> 01:11:46.920
I never had-

01:11:46.955 --> 01:11:49.355
I've never had
a surprise party before.

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:52.355
I didn't even remember
this was my birthday.

01:11:52.455 --> 01:11:53.955
Come on, come on.

01:11:57.555 --> 01:11:59.055
This is beautiful.

01:11:59.155 --> 01:12:01.820
That's us.

01:12:01.855 --> 01:12:05.055
Come on. We've got
another surprise for you.

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:07.655
VoilÃ .
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:09.555 --> 01:12:10.755
You stand back.

01:12:13.055 --> 01:12:14.255
A volcano.

01:12:29.755 --> 01:12:31.055
What's the occasion?

01:12:31.155 --> 01:12:33.105
Lina's birthday.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.055
- Yasou.
- Yasou.

01:12:37.255 --> 01:12:38.755
Good night.

01:12:45.555 --> 01:12:48.855
Hey. What's the matter?
Didn't you like my fireworks?

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:52.555
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm just very happy.

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:54.420
I want to remember this
all my life.

01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:57.255
You talk as if
it's all downhill from here.

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.755
But I don't want it to end.

01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:02.255
It doesn't have to.

01:13:02.355 --> 01:13:04.755
Once we're apart,
it's gonna be all different.

01:13:06.255 --> 01:13:08.655
So we better have a good time!

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:15.620
Hey, a little salad?

01:13:15.655 --> 01:13:19.055
- You're crazy.
- Come on!

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.672
This is not funny!

01:13:20.707 --> 01:13:22.255
You wanna be serious?

01:13:22.355 --> 01:13:25.255
How about a serious
olive oil party?

01:13:41.855 --> 01:13:43.155
Shampoo?

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:48.155
Happy birthday.

01:14:02.055 --> 01:14:04.255
OK, can we be serious now?

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:05.455
Sure.

01:14:07.455 --> 01:14:08.655
Sit down.

01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:14.055
I see your arm's all better.

01:14:35.455 --> 01:14:38.055
Here's my donkey.
OK, Barbara.

01:14:39.755 --> 01:14:41.455
Somebody hold my stirrup.

01:14:48.155 --> 01:14:49.655
What's so funny?

01:14:51.455 --> 01:14:53.955
Somebody better be ready
with a taco salad.

01:14:54.055 --> 01:14:58.020
I can hardly wait to see them.

01:14:58.055 --> 01:15:01.055
Jean, I can't believe
we're living through this.

01:15:01.155 --> 01:15:06.155
Oh, well. Come on, old paint,
let's go for it!

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:08.105
Race you to the top!

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.955
Oh, your ass! Sorry.

01:15:12.355 --> 01:15:15.155
Oh, Jean, shouldn't we call them
and tell them we're here?

01:15:15.255 --> 01:15:17.455
They don't have a phone.
I'll get us rooms tonight.

01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.955
How many douches
did you have, Miss?

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:21.055
He means showers.

01:15:22.655 --> 01:15:24.855
Aren't they ever gonna finish
Greece?

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:27.205
That must be it right there.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.455
That's it? Oh, hallelujah.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.655
There we go. You OK?

01:15:31.755 --> 01:15:34.755
I haven't been OK
since we left the ship.

01:15:34.855 --> 01:15:37.155
Would you stop laughing?

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.322
- Fifty-eight!
- Fifty-eight?

01:15:39.357 --> 01:15:41.455
- Fifty-eight!
- Thank you, lord.

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:43.055
I think I'm OK.

01:15:44.655 --> 01:15:46.520
What on earth has been going on?

01:15:46.555 --> 01:15:48.755
Whatever it was,
I'm sorry we missed it.

01:16:10.555 --> 01:16:12.255
Mrs. Featherstone.

01:16:12.355 --> 01:16:14.355
And you know my friend Barbara.

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:16.755
Sure, Mrs. Foster.

01:16:16.855 --> 01:16:18.020
What are you doing here?

01:16:18.055 --> 01:16:21.055
That's a good question, Michael.
What are we doing here?

01:16:21.155 --> 01:16:22.255
We thought
we'd surprise you two.

01:16:22.355 --> 01:16:23.420
Surprise.

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:25.255
Who's there, Michael?

01:16:25.355 --> 01:16:27.420
Lina, this is Cathy's mother.

01:16:27.455 --> 01:16:30.155
Mrs. Featherstone
and her friend Mrs. Foster.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.755
EnchantÃ©.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:33.955
Charmed.

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:40.155
Oh, I'm sorry. This is oil.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:42.055
Refreshing.

01:17:08.055 --> 01:17:10.555
- Mom.
- Cathy.

01:17:10.655 --> 01:17:12.055
Mrs. Foster.

01:17:14.155 --> 01:17:16.255
What are you doing here?

01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:17.955
Well, we were
in the neighborhood...

01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:20.255
so we thought we'd just drop in.

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.655
Drop in?

01:17:23.755 --> 01:17:25.155
I see you've all met.

01:17:25.255 --> 01:17:27.555
Oh, yes. We certainly have.

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:33.355
We had a little birthday party.

01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:37.055
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:39.220
Well, who's that strange girl?

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:41.455
Lina, the one I wrote you about,
and she's not strange.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.055
What was she doing
with Michael down there?

01:17:44.155 --> 01:17:46.055
When did you two decide to come?

01:17:46.155 --> 01:17:48.255
We two didn't decide.
It was...

01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:50.255
Don't change the subject.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:51.755
Change the subject.

01:18:04.155 --> 01:18:06.755
Well, at least it's over.

01:18:06.855 --> 01:18:09.955
- Not quite.
- What do you mean?

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:11.655
She's invited us to dinner.

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.155
Sounds like fun.

01:18:30.555 --> 01:18:33.855
Jean,
are they joined at the hip?

01:18:33.955 --> 01:18:35.155
Sweetheart.

01:18:37.855 --> 01:18:40.105
EnchantÃ©.

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:42.355
TouchÃ©.

01:18:42.455 --> 01:18:44.920
- Hi, Cathy.
- Hi, Aunt Barbara.

01:18:44.955 --> 01:18:46.855
Well, we've all been having
some wine here.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.455
What would you like to drink,
Michael?

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.055
The local wine is terrific.

01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:52.155
- Wine.
- Wine.

01:19:02.555 --> 01:19:05.055
That's a lovely dress
you have on. Where'd you get it?

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:06.355
Here in Santorini.

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:09.220
Santorini? You're kidding.

01:19:09.255 --> 01:19:11.855
Lina, it was so nice that
you could join us for dinner.

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.955
My pleasure.

01:19:14.055 --> 01:19:15.555
Another surprise.

01:19:17.755 --> 01:19:20.555
So, this is your first dinner
in Santorini.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.672
I think that's cause
for celebration.

01:19:22.707 --> 01:19:24.755
Here's to Santorini
and all of us.

01:19:26.055 --> 01:19:28.555
All five of us.

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:30.872
- Yasa.
- Yasa.

01:19:30.907 --> 01:19:33.155
Oh, how Greek.

01:19:33.255 --> 01:19:36.355
You know, I took a night course
once in Greek mythology...

01:19:36.455 --> 01:19:39.355
and I found out that Bacchus
is the god of wine.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:42.322
Uh, well, Bacchus
was a Roman god actually.

01:19:42.357 --> 01:19:45.255
The one you're thinking of
must be Dionysus.

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.455
Oh, yeah, that decadent god.

01:19:47.555 --> 01:19:50.920
Well, actually,
in Greek mythology...

01:19:50.955 --> 01:19:54.555
freedom represents
the highest form of learning...

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:55.955
not the drunken orgy.

01:19:59.555 --> 01:20:01.620
So, you came up on the donkeys.

01:20:01.655 --> 01:20:03.855
Oh, yes,
it was quite an adventure...

01:20:03.955 --> 01:20:06.855
with my friend here
and her five-inch heels.

01:20:06.955 --> 01:20:09.955
Tell me, Lina,
are you here on vacation...

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:11.720
or do you live here
all year round?

01:20:11.755 --> 01:20:14.355
Well, I'll stay here
until I finish my work.

01:20:14.455 --> 01:20:17.755
Lina's an archeologist.
She also has a beautiful villa.

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:18.855
Where?

01:20:18.955 --> 01:20:21.020
Well, I used to have it...

01:20:21.055 --> 01:20:23.555
until I moved in
with Michael and Cathy.

01:20:32.155 --> 01:20:35.055
Wonderful! I love ouzo.

01:20:37.355 --> 01:20:39.455
Cathy, would you explain
all of this to me?

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:42.255
Stop worrying, really. I've
never been happier in my life.

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:44.020
I will say
you look very happy...

01:20:44.055 --> 01:20:46.355
so I have no reason
to be worried, right?

01:20:46.455 --> 01:20:48.455
So, you tell me,
why am I so worried?

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:51.755
Bonsoir. I can make it.
Bonsoir.

01:20:51.855 --> 01:20:52.920
I'm going to say good-bye
to you now...

01:20:52.955 --> 01:20:54.855
because we have to leave
so early in the morning.

01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:58.155
Oh, Cathy. I love you.

01:20:58.190 --> 01:20:59.655
I love you, too.

01:21:07.055 --> 01:21:10.255
Do you want to watch television?

01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:12.255
In my father's shop?

01:21:15.155 --> 01:21:17.355
Let's get out of here!

01:24:07.855 --> 01:24:10.305
She knew I was fixing
moussaka tonight.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.755
That's probably why
she skipped dinner.

01:24:21.555 --> 01:24:23.655
Three thirty.

01:24:46.055 --> 01:24:47.620
Any coffee left?

01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:49.855
A little, but I think it's cold.

01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:51.255
So, where were you?

01:24:51.355 --> 01:24:53.355
You should have let us know.
We were worried about you.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:56.355
Oh, I'm sorry. I was not aware
of that obligation.

01:25:00.855 --> 01:25:02.055
I think I'll get some more.

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:21.755
You want to talk about
last night?

01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:25.455
Yeah. I was out with someone.

01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:32.120
Why?

01:25:32.155 --> 01:25:33.920
If I feel attracted
to a person...

01:25:33.955 --> 01:25:36.955
I want to feel free
to go with that person.

01:25:37.055 --> 01:25:38.720
You can understand that.

01:25:38.755 --> 01:25:41.655
You know what an open
relationship is like, don't you?

01:25:48.055 --> 01:25:49.555
We love each other.

01:25:52.555 --> 01:25:54.955
We're like a family.

01:25:57.255 --> 01:25:58.655
So, you think you know me?

01:26:01.255 --> 01:26:03.555
What's my last name?

01:26:14.055 --> 01:26:15.255
Merde!

01:26:19.455 --> 01:26:21.155
What did she say?

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:22.455
Nothing.

01:26:25.155 --> 01:26:26.855
I don't know.
Something in French.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.555
I don't know
what's going on here.

01:26:30.855 --> 01:26:32.855
She'll be back.

01:26:57.655 --> 01:27:00.455
Hi, Cathy.
Where's your French girlfriend?

01:27:02.255 --> 01:27:04.055
Oh, Greek.

01:27:14.555 --> 01:27:15.855
Motor!

01:27:15.955 --> 01:27:17.855
Playback. Quiet on the set.

01:27:29.655 --> 01:27:32.655
Lina! You made it!

01:27:32.755 --> 01:27:34.555
This is Jan Tolin.

01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:37.420
Hello.
Andreas, Lina is here!

01:27:37.455 --> 01:27:39.755
Lina, tell the director
to put you in the picture!

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:41.855
We're just passing by.

01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:43.820
Can we just watch?

01:27:43.855 --> 01:27:47.455
Sure. Come in.
This is my dressing room.

01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:50.055
- Oh, it's nice.
- Thank you.

01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:52.355
- And I love your outfit.
- Thank you.

01:27:53.755 --> 01:27:55.255
So, when are you gonna shoot?

01:27:55.355 --> 01:27:58.155
I'm in the next scene.
I must get ready.

01:27:58.255 --> 01:27:59.655
I'll wait outside.

01:28:03.955 --> 01:28:06.155
Where are your American friends?

01:28:42.255 --> 01:28:43.855
Let's not talk about that.

01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:45.155
You don't seem happy.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.355
On the yacht,
I watched you with them...

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:49.655
and you were happy then.

01:28:53.455 --> 01:28:54.955
I must go.

01:28:57.655 --> 01:28:59.755
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:29:00.855 --> 01:29:02.555
No, no, no! Stop! Stop!

01:29:09.755 --> 01:29:12.455
Do you want to stay?

01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:14.655
You want to go?

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:15.855
Come on.

01:29:31.255 --> 01:29:32.855
Excuse me.
Have you seen Lina?

01:29:32.955 --> 01:29:34.655
Sorry, I haven't.

01:29:40.955 --> 01:29:44.620
Excuse me.
Is Lina working today?

01:29:44.655 --> 01:29:46.905
No, I haven't seen her
since a couple of days.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:49.155
If you do, will you tell her
that I came by?

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:50.355
Certainly, I will.

01:29:56.855 --> 01:29:58.155
My friend Lina?

01:30:20.355 --> 01:30:21.455
Here.

01:30:22.555 --> 01:30:23.920
Read this.

01:30:23.955 --> 01:30:25.420
I'm reading this.

01:30:25.455 --> 01:30:27.155
Well, could you just read
the first paragraph...

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:29.655
just for a minute?
It's worth it.

01:30:29.755 --> 01:30:32.155
- He's a great writer.
- I'll read it out loud.

01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.655
Don't read it out loud.
It's more private.

01:30:34.755 --> 01:30:37.855
Just-it'll be good.

01:30:41.655 --> 01:30:42.920
It's beautiful.

01:30:42.955 --> 01:30:45.355
- Did you read the whole thing?
- No, I just read the top...

01:30:45.455 --> 01:30:47.555
but I really like it. I want
to finish this sentence...

01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:49.355
before I forget
what he was saying.

01:31:30.955 --> 01:31:33.255
It was fun.

01:31:35.655 --> 01:31:37.355
Nice face.

01:31:40.455 --> 01:31:41.755
Cheers.

01:32:10.355 --> 01:32:13.355
I'm gonna get some more wine.
You want anything?

01:32:15.255 --> 01:32:18.120
What was it?

01:32:18.155 --> 01:32:21.355
- Didn't it mean a thing to her?
- Take it easy, Michael.

01:32:21.455 --> 01:32:23.355
Well, what's she doing?

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.705
- She's afraid.
- Of what?

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.955
Getting close to people.

01:32:28.055 --> 01:32:30.055
She's never had that until us.

01:32:30.155 --> 01:32:32.355
Everybody's afraid
of getting close.

01:32:37.455 --> 01:32:41.855
I just wish that we could
find her and talk to her.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:46.255
Me, too, but I guess
she doesn't want to be found.

01:32:52.655 --> 01:32:54.855
You want to go home, Michael?

01:32:57.855 --> 01:33:00.305
We got three weeks left.

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.755
We can keep looking.

01:33:04.355 --> 01:33:06.355
Do you want to stay,
and I'll go home?

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:16.620
But you are paid
for three more weeks.

01:33:16.655 --> 01:33:18.955
I'll leave it empty in case
you change your mind, OK?

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:20.055
Thank you.

01:33:20.155 --> 01:33:21.855
- Did you have a nice summer?
- Very nice.

01:33:21.955 --> 01:33:24.355
- Maybe we'll see you next year.
- Maybe.
