         With Captain Healey
    sitting in the middle of it.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.335
Captain Healey, sir?

22:22.975 --> 22:24.274
                     Hm?

22:29.715 --> 22:32.683
            I think I'll go home
                and lie down.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.519
  That might
  be best, sir.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.821
And everything you've
said tonight will, of course,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.823
  remain strictly
    between us.

22:56.842 --> 22:57.908
      [SIGHS]

22:57.943 --> 22:59.576
     Thank you,
      Jeannie.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.480
             I knew you wouldn't
                 let me down.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.148
You are pleased
with me, master.

23:05.183 --> 23:07.217
                 I certainly am
               pleased with you.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.119
Well, then may I invite
a friend over?

23:09.154 --> 23:10.420
                    [LAUGHS]

23:10.455 --> 23:12.355
       Yeah, you can invite over
          anybody you want to.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.494
   We are gathered here today
        to join this man

23:17.529 --> 23:20.530
and this woman
in holy matrimony.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.440
         Oh, good morning, Roge.
           How are you feeling?

23:30.476 --> 23:32.243
 Terrible.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.345
Oh, boy. Terrible.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.513
What a--
What a night. Phew.

23:36.548 --> 23:37.848
                    Yeah?
            Well, what happened?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.649
          Did you meet Jeannie's
            mother and father?

23:39.685 --> 23:40.817
Yeah, I met them
all right.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.819
It was like tuning into
a commercial, you know.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.989
Now, don't get me wrong.
They were great, you know.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.091
Real backbone of America.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.658
              What's so terrible
                  about that?

23:48.694 --> 23:50.494
      Me.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.696
Boy, I must have been
on liquid oxygen.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.199
You know, I got so smashed,
I blacked out,

23:55.234 --> 23:58.068
wandered outside of the house
and wound up in a vacant lot.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.670
                       No.
    Yeah.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.139
Boy, she must really
be sore at me.

24:02.174 --> 24:05.642
I went back there to apologize
to her today, and she moved.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.644
I mean she moved.
The whole house was gone.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.982
Now I have to start looking
for her all over again.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.018
         Well...good luck, Roge.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.087
           Good luck.
             Yeah.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.189
          [SIGHS]

24:20.459 --> 24:23.060
  Look, uh, Tony, if you, uh,
      run across her, uh,

24:23.095 --> 24:24.327
  maybe you could let me know.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.328
       Uh, if you, uh...

24:25.364 --> 24:26.463
             Sure, Roge.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.765
             Sure.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.999
           It's a--

24:41.513 --> 24:45.115
