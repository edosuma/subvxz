01:08.458 --> 01:11.530
Do you have any plans in the United States after your studies?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.912
No,I will come back to my country

01:21.417 --> 01:23.248
Who are your idols?

01:25.417 --> 01:27.373

01:31.458 --> 01:32.698
Meng Xiaojun

Meng zi?

01:35.500 --> 01:38.913
Meng-Xiao-Jun

01:39.375 --> 01:41.832
Mr Meng Xiaojun,congratulations!

01:41.958 --> 01:43.823
Come back at friday to pick up your visa

01:46.500 --> 01:47.410
Thank you

01:47.542 --> 01:50.955
Sorry,  I give up my application

01:51.875 --> 01:52.864
Why?

01:54.958 --> 01:56.448
I love my country!

02:00.208 --> 02:01.323
He never knows

02:01.458 --> 02:05.531
After 20 years,  I am good at helping people go to America.

02:15.125 --> 02:16.285
In the general view

02:16.417 --> 02:19.033
Here is the place for teaching chinese people english

02:19.167 --> 02:21.533
This is a cool place for them

02:23.292 --> 02:27.865
Here are the scores from TOEFL、GRE and IELTS from the NEW DREAM students

02:28.000 --> 02:30.537
Americans ask me: how can the scores being so high?

02:30.667 --> 02:32.532
You must cheating

02:32.667 --> 02:35.033
Americans sometimes is so naive

02:38.958 --> 02:41.290
10000 studens who are studying in U.S

02:41.417 --> 02:43.453
3/4 from NEW DREAM!

02:43.792 --> 02:46.408
Our flag has already inserted through the entire United States

02:46.542 --> 02:48.282
Here is another one.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.240
Wisconsin

02:58.208 --> 02:59.038
Wang yang says

02:59.167 --> 03:02.000
For hundred years, Chinese people don't know how to speak english use their mouth.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.535
why don't you just open your mouth?

03:03.667 --> 03:06.249
because your confidence has destroyed by the traditional education

03:06.375 --> 03:08.866
Scared your broken-english make other people feel bad.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.582
But don't forget,your english sucks

03:11.708 --> 03:15.371
That will only make other people suffering,what are your afraid of?

03:15.792 --> 03:18.408
Meng Xiaojun,he doesn't like talk in public

03:18.542 --> 03:20.032
He likes private chat

03:20.167 --> 03:21.532
That's because you're not confident enough

03:22.250 --> 03:23.786
You think he is talking to you about visa

03:23.917 --> 03:25.999
In fact, he is talking about America

03:26.125 --> 03:28.992
Self confidence is the most basic requirements for individual in America culture

03:29.125 --> 03:30.911
I have no confidence

03:31.375 --> 03:32.660
I am afraid of being rejected

03:32.792 --> 03:35.454
Courage is resistance to fear

03:35.583 --> 03:37.244
Mastery of fear

03:37.375 --> 03:39.240
Not absence of fear

03:41.292 --> 03:42.372
Mr Meng

03:43.667 --> 03:45.953
I've fell in love with you over a year

03:48.500 --> 03:49.615
I’m married

03:49.917 --> 03:54.581
I know,but at least you can see my courage now

03:55.750 --> 03:58.947
Meng Xiaojun's grandfather
is a doctor that returned after studied in U.S in 1925

03:59.542 --> 04:01.453
gave him a English dictionary

04:15.667 --> 04:18.249
His Father is a doctor that returned after studied in U.S in 1955

04:19.000 --> 04:20.740
gave him another English dictionary

04:29.167 --> 04:31.499
Meng xiaojun's family history is America

04:31.958 --> 04:33.573
His destiny

04:34.875 --> 04:36.866
Just like he and Liang Qin's love

04:41.583 --> 04:42.993
I think a man's dream

04:43.125 --> 04:44.990
aways begins from a woman

04:45.125 --> 04:47.036
Before I know my frist love

04:47.167 --> 04:49.249
I always help another girl to carry hot water

04:49.375 --> 04:50.911
Then I found out she got a boy friend

04:51.042 --> 04:52.202
I asked her

04:52.333 --> 04:54.073
Why you still let me to carry hot water for you?

04:54.208 --> 04:56.574
She said:That's because she wanted her boy friend to take a break

04:58.792 --> 05:00.703
Although she kept refuse me over and over again

05:01.167 --> 05:03.249
But I still wanted to see her everyday

05:04.042 --> 05:05.703
Because she was my dream

05:07.333 --> 05:08.618
What is dream?

05:09.708 --> 05:11.949
Dream is a kind thing that makes u want to hold on

05:12.083 --> 05:13.789
and feel happy

05:20.125 --> 05:23.993
20 years ago,  I was the one usually give the speech

05:25.875 --> 05:28.287
Niu Yongxiao who came from the NEW DREAM says

05:28.458 --> 05:31.291
You are the one of the most unprincipled person
he've seen in his entire life

05:31.417 --> 05:33.032
Do you agree with him?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.078
He should remove the "one of"

05:35.208 --> 05:38.530
20 years ago,Cheng Dongqing has not yet learned how to talk about jokes in public

05:39.167 --> 05:41.158
Meng Xiaojun also doesn't acting so serious

05:41.917 --> 05:43.157
Only I got no change

05:46.500 --> 05:48.411
Meng Xiaojun says he loved America

05:48.542 --> 05:50.749
He does say:loved

05:51.250 --> 05:56.290
But me,the godfather of the students
Never been to America

05:57.292 --> 06:00.705
And today,America sues us

06:49.417 --> 06:51.783
Cheng Dongqing was a loser in 1979

06:51.917 --> 06:54.954
2 times failed the college entrance examination

06:55.250 --> 06:56.660
I want to take another exam

06:56.792 --> 06:58.453
Family can't afford anymore

06:58.583 --> 06:59.572
If you want to another exam

06:59.708 --> 07:02.575
Mom has to borrow money,get up

07:02.708 --> 07:03.663
Uncle Get up

07:03.792 --> 07:06.329
Dongqing,Just be reassuring be a farmer

07:06.458 --> 07:07.447
Get up get up…

07:07.583 --> 07:08.368
How about

07:08.500 --> 07:10.582
Let Dongqing take another exam

07:10.708 --> 07:13.324
Yeah  Rice still grow in the fields

07:15.708 --> 07:17.824
Well, this will be the last time

07:17.958 --> 07:19.118
That's it

07:19.250 --> 07:21.457
Let's go

07:21.583 --> 07:22.823
Please wait

07:24.292 --> 07:25.281
Money

07:25.417 --> 07:27.749
Money

07:27.875 --> 07:29.365
Americans never know

07:29.500 --> 07:31.161
Chinese hero can get down on his kneel

07:31.292 --> 07:34.329
Even can crawl through other people's crotch

08:07.042 --> 08:10.534
Shen Qing, I love you

08:10.667 --> 08:11.873
56

08:12.000 --> 08:13.331
57

08:13.458 --> 08:15.073
58

08:25.917 --> 08:29.409
My frist day in college
I met Wang Yang and Meng Xiaojun

08:42.082 --> 08:43.744
Are you insane

08:43.875 --> 08:45.581
I'm reading  what are you yelling of?

08:45.708 --> 08:46.868
Go taking your own shit

08:52.708 --> 08:53.197
Jerk

08:53.333 --> 08:54.163
Damn you

09:02.875 --> 09:04.536
Stop,  People get hit!

09:04.667 --> 09:05.952
Wait there,don't run!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.373
Sorry dude

09:12.500 --> 09:13.990
You should blame that neuropathy didn't mind his own shit

09:14.125 --> 09:14.784
Who are you talking about?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.327
You! what you just called me?

09:16.458 --> 09:17.538
Are you alright?

09:17.667 --> 09:18.873
I'm gonna beat you up

09:19.000 --> 09:19.910
Try me

09:20.042 --> 09:22.158
Don't stop him have a try

09:22.292 --> 09:26.410
Since then,I began stay with Meng Xiaojun and Wang Yang

09:30.667 --> 09:32.783
Cheng Dongqing,where's the place you most want to go

09:33.458 --> 09:33.867
Tian An Men square

09:34.000 --> 09:34.785
Tian An Men square

09:34.917 --> 09:35.702
Why?

09:35.833 --> 09:36.948
Cheng Dongqing,let me tell you

09:37.083 --> 09:38.698
look,all water is boiling

09:38.833 --> 09:40.369
Meng Xiaojun told me

09:40.500 --> 09:42.661
The place everyone wants to go is

09:42.792 --> 09:43.952
America

09:45.458 --> 09:47.369
That's it,we finish reading today

09:48.583 --> 09:50.744
Oh,there one last request

09:52.292 --> 09:55.534
I wann you guys try to use a word to describe our generation

09:56.042 --> 09:56.497
Catching up

09:56.625 --> 09:57.785
The ideal

09:57.917 --> 09:58.372
Impulse

09:58.500 --> 09:59.080
Freedom

09:59.208 --> 09:59.617
Doubt

09:59.750 --> 10:00.660
The pretty

10:01.542 --> 10:02.497
Lonely

10:02.958 --> 10:04.448
Desire sincere

10:04.583 --> 10:06.323
What about you, Cheng Dongqing?

10:08.167 --> 10:09.247
Red flag never fall

10:11.208 --> 10:12.914
Have you ever thought,right here

10:13.333 --> 10:16.450
We've been talking too much thoughts、doctrines、methods

10:17.542 --> 10:18.497
Why?

10:19.417 --> 10:21.624
Because we all want to find a ready answer

10:22.250 --> 10:23.456
We all hope someone can tell us

10:23.583 --> 10:25.039
How to live our lifes

10:25.917 --> 10:26.747
In fact

10:26.875 --> 10:29.161
No one can tell us how to live our lifes

10:29.292 --> 10:30.372
Lifes belong to our own

10:30.583 --> 10:33.325
We should find the answers for our own questions by ourselves

10:33.458 --> 10:34.447
So I think

10:35.042 --> 10:37.203
The most important thing in our generation is

10:37.333 --> 10:38.163
Change

10:38.292 --> 10:39.202
Change everyone around us

10:39.333 --> 10:40.448
Change everything around us

10:40.583 --> 10:43.290
And the only one thing won't change that's our courage

10:43.625 --> 10:45.365
If we can do that

10:45.500 --> 10:46.785
We will change the world!

10:51.375 --> 10:52.660
Meng Xiaojun told me

10:52.792 --> 10:55.374
Only one place can really change the world

10:55.958 --> 10:57.198
U.S.A

10:57.333 --> 10:59.244
So what do you think of U.S.A?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.786
Wang Yang is always busy join dancing parties

11:02.375 --> 11:04.161
Sometimes also accepts interview

11:04.625 --> 11:06.286
Although it's violate the school's rules

11:06.417 --> 11:08.282
USA  In Chinese is "Mei Guo"

11:08.417 --> 11:10.658
Means beautiful country

11:11.083 --> 11:13.199
In Japan,it means

11:13.333 --> 11:14.493
"Mi Guo"

11:14.917 --> 11:15.997
It sounds like

11:16.125 --> 11:17.035
"Rice country"

11:17.167 --> 11:18.247
Rice country?

11:18.375 --> 11:19.410
That's right

11:20.417 --> 11:22.954
Later,Wang Yang asks Lucy to interview him very often

12:21.667 --> 12:22.452
Cheng Dongqing

12:22.583 --> 12:24.119
Have you been learned the japanese

12:25.750 --> 12:27.581
Oh yeah,that one you have is legacy version

12:27.708 --> 12:29.699
You should read the oxford version

12:32.250 --> 12:35.322
Look,  "Louse"means lice

12:37.250 --> 12:38.456
lice from the animals

12:41.375 --> 12:42.706
Can I?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.740
Sorry

12:48.083 --> 12:50.199
It doesn't matter

12:50.792 --> 12:52.407
I promise to Meng Xiaojun

12:53.167 --> 12:54.282
In order to be like him

12:55.083 --> 12:57.369
I will read 800 books during all my 4 years in college

12:58.167 --> 13:00.408
I will sweep the whole Yanjing University library

13:01.417 --> 13:03.123
I only have to ask Wang Yang for help

13:03.250 --> 13:05.912
Let him to get a key from library manager

13:12.417 --> 13:16.456
I thought I was the frist one
sneaked into the school library instead of stealing books

15:34.417 --> 15:35.748
Stop following me

15:40.500 --> 15:43.822
There is a kind girl will refuse you

15:44.667 --> 15:46.203
Before you talk

15:49.458 --> 15:52.621
Wang Yang says the love is like a video camera

15:53.583 --> 15:56.575
Sometimes needs to fast forward,and sometimes needs to rewind

15:57.042 --> 15:59.249
Sometimes,needs to pause

16:01.125 --> 16:03.036
Sorry

16:15.583 --> 16:19.075
Now Lucy press the fast forward button

17:31.542 --> 17:32.873
He vomited

17:33.000 --> 17:33.534
Vomited...

17:33.667 --> 17:35.203
also cried all night

17:35.333 --> 17:37.039
I only cry for one thing

17:37.167 --> 17:42.036
When I myself boared on the TIME magazine in America

17:42.167 --> 17:44.328
Why don't you say when you become American president

17:44.458 --> 17:46.244
Actually that's the only thing i can't do

17:46.625 --> 17:48.365
You have to born in U.S

17:49.083 --> 17:52.621
U.S will never get rid of racial discrimnation

17:52.792 --> 17:53.747
If a white person

17:53.875 --> 17:57.447
see 3 black men entered the elevator at same time

17:57.583 --> 18:00.245
He will escape the elevator

18:00.375 --> 18:01.581
right before the door close

18:02.208 --> 18:03.618
In the opinion of white people

18:03.750 --> 18:08.119
Black people are always the lazy、ignorant and savage race

18:08.250 --> 18:12.869
So those chinese Americans should be clever and hardworking in America

18:13.000 --> 18:13.989
But they say

18:14.125 --> 18:17.743
Chinese people destroyed local people's job opportunities.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.456
Sir

18:20.333 --> 18:21.493
Have you been in America before?

18:22.208 --> 18:24.073
All you know about America is from the book

18:24.875 --> 18:25.910
Yes sir

18:26.042 --> 18:27.873
Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth

18:28.000 --> 18:29.206
What's the major of you two people?

18:29.333 --> 18:30.994
The"American dream"

18:31.833 --> 18:34.449
is the dream that everybody has the equal opportunities

18:34.583 --> 18:35.572
Only U.S.A can do that in the world

18:35.708 --> 18:38.620
Young man,you are too young

18:38.750 --> 18:39.580
Too naive

18:39.708 --> 18:43.030
Sir,I will go to America

18:43.417 --> 18:45.248
I'll find out by myself

18:50.667 --> 18:51.827
Sit down!

18:51.958 --> 18:52.822
You need finish the class

18:52.958 --> 18:53.868
Who the hell is you

18:54.000 --> 18:54.864
He is my teacher

18:55.000 --> 18:55.989
Non of your business

18:56.125 --> 18:58.832
Teacher deserves respect!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.285
What the hell is this world

19:04.417 --> 19:04.872
Beat them up

19:05.000 --> 19:06.080
Run!

19:16.708 --> 19:19.780
If I didn't qualify
to become their good friend

19:20.500 --> 19:23.412
Now I do

19:36.500 --> 19:39.116
Meng Xiaojun says if I keep chasing Su Mei just like kicking against the pricks

19:39.875 --> 19:43.038
Wang Yang says he gonna help me do the "kick" thing

19:44.292 --> 19:45.498
She is coming

19:45.958 --> 19:48.074
I gonna move away the ladder

19:48.542 --> 19:49.748
Hold on

19:51.042 --> 19:51.952
Good luck

20:04.542 --> 20:05.452
Ladder

20:05.708 --> 20:06.743
What the...

20:06.875 --> 20:08.081
Ladder

20:12.208 --> 20:13.789
Rorbert Frost says

20:13.917 --> 20:17.580
A mother used 20 years to make her son cleer

20:18.292 --> 20:20.283
while a girl make him a stupid

20:20.417 --> 20:22.078
in 20 seconds

20:23.667 --> 20:25.328
Hey,time's up

20:29.042 --> 20:30.407
If you don't accept me

20:31.500 --> 20:32.990
I will drag you jump with me

20:43.167 --> 20:44.373
Would die rather than surrender

20:46.083 --> 20:47.243
Jump

20:47.375 --> 20:48.865
I can't swim

20:49.583 --> 20:50.663
Jump!

20:51.333 --> 20:53.824
At last, Su Mei got acute pneumonia

20:55.292 --> 20:58.705
Wang Yang says this "kick" just like a protracted war

20:58.833 --> 21:01.745
The most important tactics is clingy consumption of the other side

21:01.875 --> 21:04.708
At last you may get her

21:04.833 --> 21:05.743
Beat it

21:11.125 --> 21:13.411
I told you,beat it

21:19.167 --> 21:20.202
Just leave

21:22.708 --> 21:23.868
it's infective

21:49.875 --> 21:50.864
Cheng Dongqing

21:52.250 --> 21:53.615
Why you

21:57.042 --> 21:58.248
Why you?

22:00.625 --> 22:02.081
Why it can't be me?

22:09.500 --> 22:10.990
Be accompanied by the cough sound

22:11.125 --> 22:11.910
At last

22:12.042 --> 22:15.580
I got tuberculosis,had to take a year off

22:31.375 --> 22:33.036
One day when i was in hospital

22:33.542 --> 22:34.952
Wang Yang asked Meng Xiaojun

22:35.375 --> 22:36.990
to come to hospital visit me

22:37.583 --> 22:38.572
May i leave now

22:41.458 --> 22:42.163
Bye

22:43.875 --> 22:46.161
I didn't see any thing,"Dai Yu"

22:48.208 --> 22:49.243
I really can't go there

22:50.250 --> 22:51.410
TOEFL exam is coming soon

22:52.292 --> 22:53.873
What if I got infected

22:54.667 --> 22:55.873
after I visit him

22:56.625 --> 22:57.705
This is so important to me

22:58.458 --> 22:59.994
Give this to him

23:24.625 --> 23:27.697
I fulfilled my promise  finished 800 books

23:27.833 --> 23:29.869
My english no longer be heard as japanese

23:30.000 --> 23:32.616
But in the end still got rejected

23:32.750 --> 23:35.287
Who are you to reject me  Who are you to reject me

23:35.417 --> 23:36.247
I've got all materials done!

23:36.375 --> 23:37.706
How many times I've been here

23:37.833 --> 23:41.075
Please listen  Let me explain!

23:41.208 --> 23:43.620
American people needs me!

23:45.000 --> 23:47.036
Lucy says she doesn't wann to leave China

23:47.750 --> 23:49.581
Wang Yang gave up the visa for her

23:49.792 --> 23:51.157
Why?

23:52.083 --> 23:54.825
Why reject me?

23:54.958 --> 23:58.075
U.S.A Here I come!

23:59.458 --> 24:02.120
U.S.A Here I come!

24:02.250 --> 24:05.367
Let's go, American people don't need you right now

24:08.542 --> 24:09.702
Xiao Jun

24:11.208 --> 24:13.540
Thank you for those words on the bookmarks

24:14.875 --> 24:16.991
"Hope one day I will make you jealous"

24:25.375 --> 24:29.618
Meng Xiaojun says he was born for this day

24:29.750 --> 24:32.787
His grandfather and father all been studied in U.S.A

24:32.917 --> 24:34.532
Then they back to China

24:35.083 --> 24:38.075
But now he want to break his family tradition

24:38.458 --> 24:39.573
I won't come back

24:42.792 --> 24:46.705
Meng Xiaojun  You got the guts

24:46.833 --> 24:49.996
If you got the guts, Don't ever come back!

27:24.333 --> 27:26.870
Xiao Jun,I've been busy having class recently

27:27.333 --> 27:28.789
The students like my class

27:29.333 --> 27:33.622
Because other classes make them tired,they can go sleep in my class

27:34.667 --> 27:35.497
Also

27:36.875 --> 27:38.411
I love my country

27:41.458 --> 27:42.322

Mr Cheng,here is the mail from U.S

28:01.708 --> 28:04.620
Xiao Jun,don't you send TIME magazine

28:05.250 --> 28:07.036
Because you haven't on the cover yet

28:08.542 --> 28:09.281
Right?

28:10.417 --> 28:13.534
I think this magazine is more suitable for Wang Yang

28:14.125 --> 28:18.619
But I still need to check it frist with critical eyes

28:25.375 --> 28:26.330
Got water?

28:27.333 --> 28:27.992
Yeah

28:31.458 --> 28:35.076
The latest date of TOEFL ridiculously expensive

28:37.333 --> 28:38.322
Wait a little longer

28:38.708 --> 28:39.868
After I get payoff

28:40.583 --> 28:41.663
Nevermind  doesn't matter

28:44.708 --> 28:45.697

Xiao Jun, You have no idea

29:56.625 --> 29:58.661
Tough time,  couldn't find any job after graduation

29:59.000 --> 30:04.165
Why did the rooster crow before the day break?

30:04.792 --> 30:05.622
Why

30:09.208 --> 30:11.073
How about Liao Qin?  You get married?

30:13.833 --> 30:15.414
She is teaching piano in long island

30:15.583 --> 30:17.539

31:04.792 --> 31:07.989
You haven't metion about my remuneration

31:10.333 --> 31:14.531
Mr Cheng, Do you know why I ask for your help?

31:15.167 --> 31:18.614
Because you are an honest man

31:19.292 --> 31:21.328
School isn't the market

31:22.542 --> 31:25.079
Money will change the nature

31:35.667 --> 31:37.532
Take this

31:38.083 --> 31:39.118
Enjoy

31:42.500 --> 31:46.163
Other people go into business,I only cook dumplings

32:04.125 --> 32:05.205
Where you got these money

32:05.750 --> 32:07.035
It's the payoff from my tutoring

32:09.750 --> 32:10.739
Eat more

32:10.875 --> 32:12.456
I'm full

32:20.500 --> 32:21.865
Pretend I am the visa officer now

32:59.083 --> 32:59.993
No need ask

33:03.542 --> 33:04.702
I've got the visa today

34:16.833 --> 34:19.495
Cheng Dongqing,I told the visa officer

34:19.625 --> 34:21.661
When I finish my study...

34:43.333 --> 34:45.574
Lucy broke up with Wang Yang

34:45.708 --> 34:49.656
Lucy said her VCR now only has the fast forward function

34:49.792 --> 34:51.077
She wants to go back to America

34:52.375 --> 34:53.989
Because the luggage has been more than enough

34:54.625 --> 34:56.911
Will be overweighted if take Wang Yang with her

34:57.125 --> 34:59.992
No one is willing to publish my book

35:00.792 --> 35:04.159
Now you are just a pile of waste paper

35:05.000 --> 35:06.865
I'm just a neuropathy

35:33.958 --> 35:38.531
Wang Yang said  His 80s die today

35:57.458 --> 35:58.698
Very cheap

36:01.750 --> 36:04.241
Please get me a few trucks then

36:04.958 --> 36:08.155
Got dollars?  Bill of exchange also ok

36:08.292 --> 36:09.953
Wait,buddy, let's make a deal

36:18.500 --> 36:20.786
What's the matter with you ,Still reading Carnegie?

36:21.958 --> 36:23.118
He is a liar

36:24.083 --> 36:25.573
Why you moved here?

36:25.708 --> 36:27.915
There is a American grandpa open a store in the front

36:38.958 --> 36:42.621
Still got enough the soap、toothpaste、towels?

36:42.750 --> 36:43.535
I will send you more if you need

36:43.667 --> 36:45.578
Oh right,Old Di went into business in Hainan

36:45.708 --> 36:47.414
He mailed 2 boxes of coconut milk coffee to you

36:47.542 --> 36:48.827
But it doesn't taste good,so I won't send no more

36:48.958 --> 36:52.030
Cheng Dongqing kept come here to call Su Mei every week

36:52.167 --> 36:55.864
Su Mei said she studies very hard everyday for the scholarship

36:56.000 --> 36:57.865
Except that she goes to a restaurant wash dishes

36:59.000 --> 37:00.786
Hurry up, we're off duty

37:02.917 --> 37:05.624
Every time when i called,at last Su Mei would say

37:05.750 --> 37:08.116
That's it, I'm tired

37:16.667 --> 37:17.907
Cheng Dongqing

37:18.042 --> 37:21.364
Professor Oilver treated me very nice,and the students also very friendly

37:30.625 --> 37:32.911
The assistant needs high professional requirements

37:33.042 --> 37:35.784
Although it's hard but compare with washing dishes

37:35.917 --> 37:37.327
here is the heaven

37:37.500 --> 37:39.081
Xiao Jun

38:27.583 --> 38:30.450
Cheng Dongqing  I with Liang Qin rented apartment

38:30.875 --> 38:34.367
Near the school,only 2 blocks away

38:35.792 --> 38:38.659
Although it's a little noisy but we got good lighting

38:43.542 --> 38:45.578
If I keep teaching piano like this

38:46.250 --> 38:48.662
I'm gonna lose my hands someday

38:49.125 --> 38:52.367
But it's ok,  You still got a laboratory job

38:53.250 --> 38:55.411
So we can move away from here soon

38:57.458 --> 38:58.823
We are still lucky

38:59.583 --> 39:01.244
At least we're still doing our old profession

39:01.375 --> 39:04.617
In the letter you wrote me doesn't say so

39:11.000 --> 39:15.039
I got caught by school being tutor outside

39:15.167 --> 39:16.623
They may fire me

39:16.750 --> 39:18.081
Congratulations

39:18.750 --> 39:20.786
You will long live in your students hearts

39:21.333 --> 39:22.493
I'm in college now

39:24.083 --> 39:28.122
My mom owns every neighbors money in the village,don't want her to repay

39:28.792 --> 39:34.367
If I were you,I would resign before they fire me

39:35.333 --> 39:38.245
Resign? It would take me starve to death

39:38.375 --> 39:40.161
I already quit,Am I dead here?

39:40.292 --> 39:42.283
If not me,you should've dead already

39:43.958 --> 39:45.323
The world has changed

39:45.458 --> 39:47.289
Selling eggs in the street even earn more than you did

39:47.417 --> 39:49.328
Don't worry, you will be alright

39:49.500 --> 39:50.535
Keep watching

39:51.208 --> 39:54.075
I break the rules from school and run private english training class

39:54.208 --> 39:57.496
deserve punishment

39:58.000 --> 39:59.581
With a heartfelt admiration

40:00.000 --> 40:02.912
But earnestly request the leadership give me a chance

40:03.417 --> 40:06.830
to take the lighter punishment

40:07.208 --> 40:10.120
Self-criticism person: Cheng Dongqing

40:49.708 --> 40:50.948
Cheng Dongqing

40:52.542 --> 40:53.907
Let's break up

41:09.375 --> 41:12.037
This year,  Beijing's bid failed

41:13.458 --> 41:15.870
Both of them stayed behind

41:19.125 --> 41:20.331
Stayed behind

41:27.083 --> 41:30.155
You can not sleep in class

41:31.375 --> 41:33.286
You are at the best university

41:33.417 --> 41:36.250
You parents spent all their money sent you here

41:36.375 --> 41:38.240
Not for sleeping

41:38.375 --> 41:40.206
If you don't like my class

41:40.333 --> 41:41.448
You can leave

42:00.083 --> 42:01.448
Why you want to learn english

42:01.583 --> 42:03.494
Go to America, Mr Cheng

42:04.083 --> 42:05.243
Do you like English?

42:05.375 --> 42:06.535
No

42:06.667 --> 42:07.827
So am I

42:07.958 --> 42:08.743
Really

42:09.333 --> 42:11.619
But you know my vocabularies is also good

42:12.458 --> 42:13.823
That's because of you

42:13.958 --> 42:16.370
One day a student bring up a english word
and ask me

42:16.500 --> 42:17.785
How to read this word

42:20.667 --> 42:22.498
It knows me but i don't know it

42:26.250 --> 42:27.740
I feel so embarrassed

42:28.500 --> 42:29.660
So I went back to read dictionaries

42:29.792 --> 42:31.248
One by one

42:32.083 --> 42:33.914
See any of you can got me

42:36.417 --> 42:37.623
You know

42:37.750 --> 42:39.331
The most thing I afraid of is other people look down on me

42:39.458 --> 42:40.948
Because I'm from country side

42:41.375 --> 42:42.865
So I always want to please them

42:43.000 --> 42:45.742
My best friends Meng Xiaojun and Wang Yang laughed at me

42:45.875 --> 42:48.491
Said:Don't act like you are stupid

42:48.917 --> 42:49.872
stupid

42:51.083 --> 42:52.914
I wasn't sure what they were talking about

42:53.042 --> 42:54.202
and even refuted them

42:54.667 --> 42:55.782
I'm not acting like stupid

42:56.208 --> 42:57.493
I am stupid

43:00.583 --> 43:04.701
And later I got a girl, the most beautiful girl in school to be my girl friend

43:05.250 --> 43:07.206
Then we graduated

43:07.833 --> 43:11.746
After graduation, we studied TOEFL,and went to get visa

43:12.250 --> 43:16.038
In the end, she passed,I was rejected

43:17.083 --> 43:18.414
So I become...

43:19.292 --> 43:21.499
The man who was left behind

43:24.875 --> 43:26.706
She slept with me right before she left China

43:38.792 --> 43:43.286
Mr Cheng,Why you acting so different today

43:49.917 --> 43:51.157
Students

43:58.750 --> 44:03.414
Cheng Dongqing, who from the forgein language department
Because run private classes outside the school

44:03.542 --> 44:08.912
Has disrupted the order of teaching rules in school
Caused serious adverse effects

44:09.042 --> 44:11.078
So the school decide

44:11.250 --> 44:15.744
Give the teacher Cheng Dongqing dismissed faculty punishment

44:23.083 --> 44:26.120
Cheng Dongqing became the frist teacher
dismissed faculty publicly

44:26.250 --> 44:27.615
He was written into school's history

44:28.042 --> 44:30.203
This is the thing even Meng Xiaojun can't be done

44:30.625 --> 44:33.287
That day he was forced out of the teacher's dormitory

44:33.417 --> 44:34.076
Mr Cheng

44:34.208 --> 44:35.072
Mr Cheng

44:35.208 --> 44:36.914
Where is your private school?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.911
I will take the TOEFL exam next month

44:40.042 --> 44:43.079
I'm afraid of examination,and I would like to join your english tutor class

44:46.458 --> 44:47.948
No one knows better than me

44:48.625 --> 44:49.705
He had no choice

44:50.625 --> 44:53.332
If he didn't accept,He had to go back to his hometown

44:54.000 --> 44:55.956
And speak english to rice in the field everyday

45:00.208 --> 45:01.698
You should understand

45:01.833 --> 45:03.164
Su Mei won't leave America

45:03.292 --> 45:04.657
So she had to break up with you

45:05.417 --> 45:06.372
What's wrong

45:07.000 --> 45:08.786
I think my youth is over

45:09.417 --> 45:10.907
And buried here

45:11.792 --> 45:13.748
You are disgusting

45:17.125 --> 45:19.537
When a lovelorn person suffering starvation

45:19.667 --> 45:20.952
will acting abnormal

45:21.458 --> 45:24.120
Whenever Cheng dongqing found a wall

45:24.250 --> 45:26.662
He would start posting ads

45:27.042 --> 45:29.829
Almost all the walls near this area
all damaged by us

45:30.833 --> 45:33.449
He almost climbed all telegraph poles in Yanjing University

45:33.917 --> 45:35.999
The way I used taught him to chase that girl

45:36.417 --> 45:38.999
Now he is using it to sell his training class

45:48.917 --> 45:50.873
Cheng Dongqing picked here for the training class

45:51.000 --> 45:52.285
Only one reason

45:52.417 --> 45:54.658
Order 1 chicken nugget, you can sit here all day

45:56.667 --> 45:57.907
Progressive

45:59.500 --> 46:00.455
Lower your voice

46:00.583 --> 46:01.948
Progressive

46:07.917 --> 46:09.123
Go get another chicken nugget

46:10.542 --> 46:12.032
Today we talk about this

46:13.958 --> 46:14.822
Ambulance

46:14.958 --> 46:15.947
How to make your remember better?

46:16.833 --> 46:18.118
(in chinese:I can't die)

46:18.250 --> 46:19.285
Ambulance

46:20.333 --> 46:21.118
Pregnant

46:21.250 --> 46:22.456
(in chinese:I want a boy)

46:22.792 --> 46:23.656
(in Chinese:A man jump to me)

46:23.792 --> 46:24.451
Pregnant

46:25.708 --> 46:26.743
In fact

46:26.875 --> 46:28.786
the choice made by a person who under the living helpless

46:29.125 --> 46:30.205
Always right

46:31.083 --> 46:32.789
But this is not a permanet fix

46:33.542 --> 46:34.873
We need a more bigger place

46:35.375 --> 46:36.615
more students

46:36.750 --> 46:38.206
How about you join with me to be my partner

46:38.917 --> 46:41.283
You're better than me,and you well trained by American chicks

46:41.750 --> 46:43.035
We're on same boat

46:43.917 --> 46:44.952
All yours

46:45.333 --> 46:49.406
Successful people always spontaneously with the needs of the times

46:50.417 --> 46:51.372
Who said that

46:51.500 --> 46:52.455
Carnegie

46:54.417 --> 46:55.953
I thought you said he is a liar

46:56.083 --> 46:58.540
The biggest liar actually is ourselves

46:59.042 --> 47:00.998
Because we always want to change other people

47:01.125 --> 47:02.535
And refuse to change ourselves

47:02.667 --> 47:03.782
I'm in if there more chicken nuggets

47:07.542 --> 47:09.203
This huge place is ours now

47:10.208 --> 47:11.914
This is a abandoned country-owned factory

47:12.375 --> 47:13.831
All workers here are laid-off at home now

47:13.958 --> 47:16.199
Cheng Dongqing,the chicken thief

47:16.958 --> 47:19.165
After he took advantage of American grandpa

47:19.292 --> 47:22.284
and now he gonna take advantage of this country

47:44.375 --> 47:45.410
Students

47:45.542 --> 47:48.500
Learn english just like learn bird chirp

47:48.625 --> 47:50.081
When you are learning bird chirp in the woods

47:50.208 --> 47:52.369
If there 4 birds land on your shoulders

47:52.500 --> 47:54.081
That means you just passed english leve-4

47:54.208 --> 47:56.745
If there 6 birds on your shoulders

47:57.167 --> 47:58.828
That means you passed english leve-6

47:58.958 --> 48:00.744
When there a flock of birds on your shoulders

48:00.875 --> 48:02.536
That means you past the TOEFL

48:02.667 --> 48:04.373
That means you become a bird man!

48:07.042 --> 48:09.328
Outside there was a girl came to ask me

48:09.875 --> 48:12.241
Mr Cheng,I fall in love with one guy

48:12.375 --> 48:14.366
But except He has good looking face

48:14.500 --> 48:15.489
No other advantage

48:15.625 --> 48:16.535
How should I do

48:16.667 --> 48:17.497
I told her

48:17.625 --> 48:20.367
If this girl looking for a guy only for his good looking face

48:20.875 --> 48:22.115
That's called"Hao se"

48:23.125 --> 48:23.955
Horny

48:25.292 --> 48:28.159
But if a guy looking for a girl for her good looking face

48:28.292 --> 48:29.372
That's called"Shen mei"

48:30.208 --> 48:31.368
Aesthetics

48:33.000 --> 48:36.538
But my aesthetic ability has been maintained
at the statutory range

48:36.667 --> 48:39.079
Later I catched up with the most beautiful girl in legal system

48:39.208 --> 48:42.120
This loser mocked his love in his class

48:42.250 --> 48:43.535
For make students laugh

48:43.667 --> 48:46.409
He was so mean  Must very painful in his heart

48:52.958 --> 48:55.449
But I'm using the Hollywood movie teaching method

49:02.875 --> 49:03.830
Did you not hear me?

49:03.958 --> 49:05.823
Most of it,Just...

49:05.958 --> 49:07.414
You never seen this moive

49:07.542 --> 49:09.248
Malone Brando's "on the waterfront"

49:09.500 --> 49:10.956
Nope

49:11.083 --> 49:12.698
So what moive you watched recently

49:12.833 --> 49:13.538
"Ghost"

49:25.208 --> 49:26.038
Ditto

49:26.542 --> 49:27.873
"the same ,like before"

49:28.583 --> 49:30.073
Means:" Me too"

49:30.208 --> 49:31.823
Using"Ditto"word

49:31.958 --> 49:34.995
It gives affectionate

49:39.667 --> 49:40.281
Ditto

49:44.417 --> 49:45.122
Ditto

49:48.333 --> 49:50.915
I and Wang Yang all have 12 classes each day

49:51.042 --> 49:52.578
From morning to the midnight

49:53.000 --> 49:53.864
Very tired

49:54.542 --> 49:56.407
Wang Yang said he got bad memory when he was tired

49:56.958 --> 49:59.370
Never ask why we are doing this

50:00.125 --> 50:01.285
But feel happy

50:06.417 --> 50:08.157
We got the money

50:54.875 --> 50:55.864

50:56.750 --> 50:59.116
You should deceive back from your life!

51:52.833 --> 51:54.039
Meng Xiaojun

51:54.167 --> 51:55.657
We can't change the world

51:56.625 --> 51:57.910
The world is changing us

53:30.000 --> 53:31.285
I did lied to you

53:32.833 --> 53:34.198

54:31.958 --> 54:33.573
Hometown's rule:

55:31.417 --> 55:32.953
Here is a little bit far from downtown

55:33.083 --> 55:34.698
So the students have to live here

55:35.750 --> 55:36.739
But Xiaojun

55:37.208 --> 55:40.245
I think we might got good future

55:40.375 --> 55:42.866
Of course we can't compare with you in the U.S

55:43.792 --> 55:46.989

56:14.792 --> 56:16.999
He's my idol

56:17.125 --> 56:18.456
The one I want to catch up

56:19.042 --> 56:21.078
but only approach his greatness

56:21.208 --> 56:23.665
Please use the applause to welcome Mr Meng

56:37.000 --> 56:39.992
truth、self confidence、specific、reasonable

56:40.625 --> 56:45.289
Is the basic idea of the principles of philosophy USA visa

57:01.042 --> 57:02.703
If Lack of confidence,He...

57:03.167 --> 57:03.906
will be weak

57:05.583 --> 57:06.993
very weak

57:07.125 --> 57:08.205
He...

57:09.708 --> 57:11.619
He believes that the weak...

57:29.500 --> 57:30.410
Sorry

57:36.208 --> 57:37.118
Students

57:39.583 --> 57:41.289
Mr Meng just returned from U.S

57:41.417 --> 57:42.748
Still has jetlag

57:42.875 --> 57:44.991
it's called "Suffering Jetlag"

57:45.125 --> 57:46.285
Suffering Jetlag

57:46.417 --> 57:48.123
Suffering Jetlag

57:48.250 --> 57:50.457
Yes,very good

58:04.833 --> 58:06.243
There another speech tommorow

58:06.958 --> 58:08.038
Cancel it

58:08.708 --> 58:09.618
Why

58:10.250 --> 58:11.535
He didn't sleep well

58:14.083 --> 58:15.118
Doesn't looks like it

58:15.750 --> 58:17.581
He is the one too harsh to himself

58:18.125 --> 58:20.457
Maybe that's"Stage Fright"

58:20.583 --> 58:21.493
Impossible

58:22.125 --> 58:23.331
He never had this before

58:23.708 --> 58:25.198
You haven't seen him for years

58:26.375 --> 58:27.865
I cleared myself

58:28.000 --> 58:29.365
No body knows America more than me

58:29.500 --> 58:31.991
I won't do any large lecture anymore

58:32.125 --> 58:34.457
I will do the one-on-one interview for visa,mock interview

58:34.875 --> 58:37.412
Oh yeah,if who wants go to U.S, they must get through...

58:37.542 --> 58:38.622
The NEW DREAM

58:41.667 --> 58:43.328
As for the speech phobia

58:43.458 --> 58:46.120
No one metioned it again

58:48.333 --> 58:49.823
As it never happened

58:50.750 --> 58:51.739
I don't understand

58:52.292 --> 58:54.078
What's the matter with your girl friend related to your visa being jejected

58:54.208 --> 58:55.243
She hurt me

58:55.375 --> 58:57.707
She metioned break up with me only in a month after she arrived in U.S

58:57.833 --> 58:58.447
That's good

58:58.583 --> 58:59.789
That means she didn't cheat you

59:00.417 --> 59:02.157
She could tell you about this after a year

59:03.750 --> 59:05.581
Let's talk about your visa being rejected

59:05.708 --> 59:09.075
It shows the reason you being rejected
because they think you have the tendency of immigrants

59:09.208 --> 59:10.573
I don't want to immigrants

59:10.917 --> 59:12.282
Even they give me that chance

59:12.417 --> 59:14.658
But no matter how I tried to explain they just didn't listen

59:14.792 --> 59:16.623
Well, since you have no tendency of immigrants

59:17.083 --> 59:18.573
Why you wrote this on the application form

59:18.708 --> 59:20.573
The purpose you go to U.S

59:20.958 --> 59:21.947
for increase revenue

59:22.083 --> 59:23.289
I was telling the truth

59:23.417 --> 59:25.499
Everyone knows that in the America you can easily earn more than in China

59:25.625 --> 59:26.205
Right

59:26.333 --> 59:28.745
If the applicant has any sign
shows the purpose he want to go to U.S

59:28.875 --> 59:30.706
Not only for receive the education

59:30.833 --> 59:31.913
It would be denied

59:32.042 --> 59:33.077
You haven't even thought of this

59:33.208 --> 59:35.449
means you don't know America

59:35.583 --> 59:37.824
You blame your girlfriend means you don't know women

59:37.958 --> 59:40.449
Long story short,You don't know yourself

59:40.583 --> 59:42.824
Go back to modify the application form

59:46.375 --> 59:47.364
Mr Meng

59:47.833 --> 59:48.993
Thank you very much!

59:49.458 --> 59:50.322
Next

59:50.458 --> 59:51.117
Let me tell you

59:51.250 --> 59:54.447
The visa officer wants to see
active and enthusiastic students who eager to talk

59:54.583 --> 59:55.618
You can't even speak clearly

59:55.750 --> 59:56.614
Second day

59:57.375 --> 01:00:01.448
The line of the students who came to join Meng Xiaojun's mock interview
Has been discharged into the street

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:02.743
Do you think Americans are easy to fool?

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:03.580
Can't you talk?

01:00:03.708 --> 01:00:05.164
If you keep crying,I can't teach you anything

01:00:05.292 --> 01:00:08.079
You should show the momentum as a green card is a piece of toilet paper

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:09.118
Even too hard to wipe your ass

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.080
Today

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:13.540
The one who take Meng Xiaojun's interview is Wang Yang

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.448
Your moive methods of teaching

01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:16.322
has slow effect

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:17.492
No structure

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.660
Have you ever thought

01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.077
Why your oral english is better than me?

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:20.742
Why?

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.705
Because you are the only one used to got American chicks

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:26.073
Are you still contact with Lucy?

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:27.823
Non of your business

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.448
You think you can also guide me?

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.915
You know what is the core of the English

01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:34.407
It's not expression

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:36.327
But logical thinking

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:38.244
You know what Americans think

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:40.161
So you speak like Americans

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:43.286
Teach this to your students

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.490
No other people can do this

01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:47.573
One student came to ask me

01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:48.823
I have correct oral english

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.038
Correct grammar

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:51.077
Huge vocabularies

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:52.744
I can easily read the "China Daily"

01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:54.331
Better than read the "Beijing Evening News"

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:56.164
If that means I have good English

01:00:56.542 --> 01:00:58.453
Then I gave to him a piece of news from "The Wall Street Journal"

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.995
Same one reported on "China Daily"

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:02.873
He hardly understand this news

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.286
He was so surprised and asked me why

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.368
I told him

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.082
"China daily" Just wrote in English

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:14.532
But the  "The Wall Street Journal"
wrote by American logical thinking

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:17.864
So,if you really want to learn good English,you must remember

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:20.578
American English thinking

01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:21.447
Good speech

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.915
But you should give a more vivid example

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:25.784
For example

01:01:25.917 --> 01:01:27.623
An American go to your home

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.035
He knocked,you open the door

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:30.031
What's the frist words you would say

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:30.747
Welcome!

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:32.411
Americans don't say welcome to their friends

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:34.453
They are drect and not so polite

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:35.493
So he would say

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:38.116
Come in,  Then you just go in

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.365
More

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.702
vivid?

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:47.075
You with a foreign girl had 4 years relationship

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:49.248
And one day she came to you and say

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.707
I'm going back to America alone

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.456
How you suppose to answer this one

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:57.540
Don't you love me anymore?

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.282
Don't go,stay with me

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:00.031
No

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.327
Don't say anything

01:02:02.458 --> 01:02:03.538
Turn around and leave

01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:06.828
Otherwise she will treat you like a piece of luggage

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:09.035
Perfect!

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:12.661
Last person who took Meng Xiaojun's interview

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:13.998
Is me

01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:15.997
Do you have a dream

01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:19.244
You don't have to make the atmosphere so ecstasy

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.573
Be serious, ok?

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.616
As for me, I'm responsible for the visa consulting

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:27.829
Wang Yang teaches the American English thinking

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:30.074
Actually this is technological competitiveness

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:32.665
What do you think is the core competitiveness of the NEW DREAM?

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:34.781
It's you

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.114
This is not funny

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.114
I'm very sincerely

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.535
Alright,I say

01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:41.658
I'm not sure whether you have a dream or not

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.077
But you should understand

01:02:43.208 --> 01:02:47.121
No one can be more persuasive

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:48.622
than this incompetent president

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:50.538
Cheng Dongqing

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.163
You are our core competitiveness

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:56.948
Just read what've wrote

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:59.165
Subject: What is the dream

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:00.156
Your turn

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.288
Students

01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:14.032
I never have any dreams

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.198
And I don't know what is the dream

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.744
I only know what is failure

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:21.703
I'm not good at other things

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.949
Except failure

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:27.575
Chinese students are the most prone to failure students in the world

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:30.780
Because you have to face the most brutal test in the world

01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:33.203
The Ministry of Education announced the enrollment rate in 1993

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:37.200
From middle school to high school is 44.1%

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:38.994
That means nearly 6 millions students have failed.

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:41.832
The college entrance examination's enrollment rate is 39.9%

01:03:41.958 --> 01:03:43.118
1 million and 40 thousands students have failed

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.287
The students who came to NEW DREAM
to take the TOEFL and GRE exams

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:47.076
I already calculated the proportion

01:03:47.208 --> 01:03:50.826
About 1/4 students can made it to study abroad and get the U.S scholarship

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:52.494
Another 30 thousands students have failed

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.414
Failure is everywhere

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:56.123
Life is so desperate

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.911
This is the reality

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:01.032
So what should we do?

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:03.998
Fall into the water you won't drown

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.953
Stay into the water you will drown

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.323
You have to swim

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.618
And keep moving forward

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.787
Those people who choose to give up from the beginning
They won't suffer failure

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.782
because they have failed from the beginning

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:16.831
Failure is not terrible thing

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:20.280
Fear of failure is the really terrible thing

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:24.825
We need to find the victory out of the defeat

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:26.539
Find hope

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.740
in despair

01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:54.914
Who is responsible in here?

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:58.535
Me

01:04:59.542 --> 01:05:03.740
You are using abandoned factory as campus unauthorized,
without permission from goverment agencies

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:05.957
This is a very serious violation behavior

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:07.038
Besides

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:08.407
You lack of formalities for this campus

01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:09.782
Accordance with the law, you will be banned

01:05:09.917 --> 01:05:11.782
Is there something so wrong with that?

01:05:13.167 --> 01:05:14.998
We have submitted the complete formalities

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:17.286
We can't do anything about they keep delaying the time

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.157
The condition to apply the school certificate

01:05:19.292 --> 01:05:22.079
That the applicat must have the academic title of associate professor at least

01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:23.994
Also must be approved by your original units

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.456
You have both unqualified

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:29.371
Listen, We are negotiating with the departments concerned

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.956
They have agreed to help us out.

01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:33.074
We're just in accordance with legal procedures

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:33.947
Can't help

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.290
What makes you say to banned our school?

01:05:36.417 --> 01:05:38.453
Now the country support the private schools

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:40.448
We are protected by law

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.789
Who are you

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:43.327
Let me talk

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:44.618
It's not like we do nothing

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.206
It's because they keep delaying the time

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.618
Also we are protected by law

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:48.660
If you breach of privilege

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:49.451
I will sue you

01:05:49.583 --> 01:05:50.288
Then go!

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:51.907
I'm waiting,go!

01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:52.997
You can't do that, sorry

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.865
Our friend got drunk

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.207
He just back from U.S

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:58.322
Still jetlaging

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:00.164
Is that makes you so different

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:01.532
If you got the guts why you're back

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:02.907
No,no,You say that again

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.998
Sit

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.536
Pleast,tell us how much?

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:08.406
We will take the punishment

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.864
Xiao jun

01:06:12.542 --> 01:06:14.282
This is not U.S,it's China

01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:17.575
Sue the cops doesn't work here

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:20.790
I didn't think you were so naive

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:24.663
Get in

01:06:24.792 --> 01:06:25.781
I'm not going back to U.S

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:26.989
Cheng Dongqing

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:29.160
I will stay

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:32.285
Be your partner

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.115
If the NEW DREAM also be a VCR

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:51.658
Meng Xiaojun has the remote

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:52.827
Ambition

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:54.413
(In chinese:I must win)

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:58.285
For him,the remote only has one funciton

01:06:58.917 --> 01:06:59.906
Fast forward button

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:01.492
Pest

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:02.660
(In chinese:beat it to death)

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.957
The value of the marketing isn't newness

01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:08.452
It's share

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:13.291
He launched 25 development project within a year

01:07:13.417 --> 01:07:14.247
It's 30 project

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:17.161
This is the preparatory plan of the future internet education

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.657
Ponderous

01:07:18.792 --> 01:07:20.157
One plan is

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:22.077
(in chinese:Fat to death)

01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:25.120
Meng xiaojun said: Teachers are the centre of the traditional university

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.365
But the centre of NEW DREAM are students

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:32.748
Let our students give teacher's score

01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:34.828
Students can fire the teacher

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:37.782
You still can be the teacher

01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:40.454
If you can't take the simple job as a teacher

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:41.538
There only one way out

01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:43.532
This job even suit for idiot

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:44.993
Like Principal

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.115
This is a bit too much

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:50.789
Nope,we can go futher than that

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:52.077
Wang Yang and I believe

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:54.323
Meng Xiaojun who from U.S

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:55.948
Has longer-term outlook than us

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:56.822
The internet

01:07:58.625 --> 01:07:59.740
It seems far away from us

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.116
If it close to us means also close to other people

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:06.290
So I always say one word to him:

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.247
Yes

01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:14.658
As the president of your campus I've seen,you are the coolest

01:08:14.792 --> 01:08:16.202
This is the largest private school in China

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.870
I would like to ask what's your formula for success

01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:21.618
Is there any?at least I don't know

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:23.747
My personal experience is

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:25.786
When you realize the failure is a detour

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:27.908
You've been walking on the track to success

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.115
Principal  here

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.331
ready, shoot

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.243
Hold

01:08:35.042 --> 01:08:35.656
Let's shoot more

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:36.326
Alright

01:08:37.707 --> 01:08:39.038
Godfather of students

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.407
Cheng Dongqing

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.410
wow,On newspaper now

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:46.538
Do I look like him

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.040
Master Cheng,shareholding reform plans

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:51.573
Cheng Dongqing

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:53.288
Yes  or  No

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:56.412
This time I will say:  NO

01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:58.656
Yes

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:01.907
I know this is very important

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.206
Please consider again

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:07.453
I thought you would say"No"

01:09:12.167 --> 01:09:15.125
Zhang Ji sure gives the lowest score

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:16.912
But

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:19.032
He was born with no sense of humor

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.406
Just like me

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.863
No,  It's alright if he didn't accept the training

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:26.157
But he even openly opposed our teaching method

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:27.997
After all he still one of the senior statesmen

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:31.241
Has been with us since the abandoned factory

01:09:31.832 --> 01:09:33.823
Otherwise I can transer him to the school office

01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:35.413
So that means

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:38.249
He's not fired but just got promotion

01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:42.328
I don't understand how come you don't even have the  guts to fire a person

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:44.038
How can you be our leadership

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:50.413
I will change,eventually

01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:55.205
Li Ping

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.698
Is there more food

01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:58.822
Yep

01:09:58.958 --> 01:09:59.913
Let's talk about the shareholding system reform

01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:00.997
What do you think

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:06.406
Xiaojun,
I think we need to temporarily postpone this

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:07.572
it can't be postpone

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:10.666
You keep it being postponed
I don't know what do you want

01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.373
Yes or No?  Just tell me you don't want to decentralization

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.866
No,I never think so

01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:21.531
Yes

01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.368
I agree

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:32.866
You're the greatest contribution and this is your share

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.786
I take 51%

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:38.040
You and Wang Yang together 49%

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:40.197
You 25%

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:41.743
Him 24%

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.823
You cooked this?

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:49.872
Nice

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:57.700
Let's find another time to sign subscription agreement

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:05.368
Cheng Dongqing

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:09.115
Do you have a dream

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.615
Please,not again

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.331
I feel like vomit to talk about this everyday

01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:15.164
Do you have a dream

01:11:15.292 --> 01:11:16.907
You mean spring dream?

01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:22.956
You know,  When you listen to a person

01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:26.578
Don't listen to what he says

01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:28.831
But listen to what he doesn't say

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.660
What you don't say

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.038
Come on

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.410
You slept with a girl student

01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:41.868
and make her pregnant

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:43.868
Meng Xiaojun

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.035
You can't do this

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:47.582
After all,I'm still a good friend with Liang Qin

01:11:55.417 --> 01:11:57.123
You're cheating her

01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.032
Shut up

01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:04.615
Our own material part:The TOEFL and GRE test

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:08.371
haven't authorized by EES from USA education service center

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.907
it will be a great hidden danger in our future

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.660
Cheng Dongqing

01:12:58.792 --> 01:12:59.781
The negotiations failed

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:20.830
Please be on the market

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:22.118
Yeah,be on the market

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.911
You really no need take too much pressure

01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:25.498
I don't blame you about the outcome of the negotiations with EES

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.368
Still remember druing the 2nd day after I returned home

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.412
I said: This isn't just a school

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.365
I didn't say because I didn't want to shock you

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:36.239
You tell me

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.202
Why should we list to the stock market

01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:40.656
To become number one

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:42.282
I thought we are already number one

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.873
certainly not if out of China

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.207
So we need to start listing as soon as possible,the sooner the better

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.457
This time I will say:

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:53.702
NO

01:13:59.042 --> 01:13:59.997
NO

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:10.540
A friend sent me a bottle of 82 Lafite today

01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:26.203
We are not lacking of money,why we have to be listed

01:14:26.958 --> 01:14:28.619
I only know reading and only want to do the education

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.115
The NEW DREAM belongs to us

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:31.831
Barony cost is the lowest

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:33.448
The market is investment shareholders

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:35.323
Why give yourself a cage

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:36.823
everyone is in the cage

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:39.745
That backward thinking has became his imprison cage

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:40.990
To make the NEW DREAM become internationalization

01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:42.240
it has to be listed

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:43.785
He is not totally oppose

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:45.282
He is just against to listed company right now

01:14:45.417 --> 01:14:48.614
Every competitor wants to become the frist chinese education industry shares

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.739
He felt there is still time

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:50.580
Let me tell you

01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:52.994
No one will remember the second man on the moon

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.615
Why should we leave the earth

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:55.997
He is too eager

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.407
Education for stability and capital for fast

01:14:58.542 --> 01:14:59.657
They are not compatible

01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:01.407
There not only 3 person on this boat now

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:02.782
We've got 50 thousands students here

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:04.327
Frist we need ensure the boat won't sink

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.119
He dared not risk because of his fear of failure

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.535
Afraid of getting back to the loser

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:08.497
There is only one reason

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:09.034
What?

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.249
Because he doesn't deserve today's success

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:16.288
He really said so

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:17.822
Yes

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:20.157
He said that you are now more and more successful

01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:22.032
He's very proud of you

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:28.322
Have you ever thought about what Meng Xiaojun really wants to

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:50.952
Merry Christmas

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:03.497
What's this

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.740
What's this

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:06.455
This isn't funny

01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:08.364
Cheng Dongqing

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.865
Enjoy your christmas!

01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:12.994
This is his christmas gift

01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:16.037
The 300 square meters land that has the right to use for 70 years

01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:18.206
He doesn't know

01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:19.413
What I really want

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.907
He doesn't know what Meng Xiaojun wants

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.448
He can only be sure

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:26.748
What he doesn't want

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:42.038
Today is our NEW DREAM's
first time shareholders' meeting

01:16:42.792 --> 01:16:45.374
Please read this business plan

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:48.197
What's this?

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.706
Our 3 person's stength is limited

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.789
We should reunite all forces we got

01:16:53.333 --> 01:16:56.291
Now NEW DREAM belong to everyone who sits here

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.157
My question is why I got less share

01:16:58.292 --> 01:16:59.247
Me too

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:02.198
I raised 30% of the shares

01:17:02.333 --> 01:17:04.745
Some was given to these old employees

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.457
Others as part of our option pool

01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:08.993
All of our shares have been diluted

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.743
But you and Wang Yang are still the largest shareholders except me

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:15.368
You know it

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.910
I just heard

01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:18.743
But I agree

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.116
It seems that I was the last one know about this

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.080
Why

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:24.539
This is my decision after careful consideration

01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:27.283
You're doing this to prevent me continue my listing plan

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:31.906
I was right

01:17:34.292 --> 01:17:35.498
You're too eager

01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:36.705
I just want to slow it down

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.617
Some things only have to stopped to see more clearly

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.116
Yeah,it has stopped now

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.955
You gathered all people here

01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:45.664
with the interests

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:49.205
You can deny any plans of mine in the future

01:17:49.583 --> 01:17:50.993
You start taking over my job now,right?

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:51.989
I agree

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.162
Now this is system

01:17:58.167 --> 01:17:59.282
《History as a Mirror》

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.365
a fundamental solution,right?

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:04.407
Absolute Wanli of the Ming Dynasty

01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:06.908
But Cheng Dongqing, Don't forget what kind of age we are living in now

01:18:07.042 --> 01:18:08.327
I think you may have misunderstood

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:10.539
That's it! Meeting dissmissed

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.453
You've got plan to learn swim with coach, you can go now

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:14.369
He has already learned

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.410
how to swim

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:17.953
I'm so surprise to see the way you are

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:19.948
Why can't we just talk about this in private

01:18:20.083 --> 01:18:21.869
Not only 3 of us on this ship now

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.412
Let me tell you,  Your ship has been out and it can't stop

01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:25.201
Only have to keep moving foward

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:28.040
Nobody can stop the NEW DREAM listed on market

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.449
I have the most significant responsibility for the NEW DREAM

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.073
The person who should make the decision here

01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:35.785
It's me

01:18:36.583 --> 01:18:39.700
Because I'm the greatest leader in NEW DREAM

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:40.784
Leader

01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:43.032
I was the one who give the "NEW DREAM" advise

01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:44.202
The technology layer is given by Wang Yang

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:45.072
As for you

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.707
Except take money with sacks,What else do you know?

01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:00.119
Cheng Dongqing,Lackeys of the US

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.824
NEW DREAM the lackey's school

01:19:02.958 --> 01:19:06.496
Traitor Cheng Dongqing,you're a traitor

01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:07.865
Who is the traitor

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.240
Call the police,quick

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.912
Who is the national sinners, Who is the traitor

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.331
Americans bombed Chinese embassy

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.540
You came to hit the english school

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.658
What if aliens blow the earth

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.123
Are you going to hit the space department?

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:33.083
He can always step in at the most inopportune times

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:35.618
This I can't do

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:37.866
What's the difference between 30 years ago and now

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.661
All you do is nest cross

01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:41.789
Chinese people hit chinese people

01:19:41.917 --> 01:19:42.952
Coward

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.243
Outrageous

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:47.207
Go to learn from the person who hit you

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:49.665
Until you become stronger than him

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:54.373
Now he is the godfather of students

01:19:58.292 --> 01:20:00.123
Everyone thinks I'm gonna leave

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:07.995
the number of NEW DREAMS students have broke

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:13.957
Three million eight hundred and eighty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight

01:20:27.417 --> 01:20:30.989
You know when I was fired from the school

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:32.456
I just started this private school

01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:36.155
Everyday I carried the paste barrel ran into the roads and climbed wire pole paste ads

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:39.489
Now whenever I saw the wire pole,I can't help to climb up and paste more ads

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:40.910
This doesn't hurt

01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:42.157
Do business

01:20:42.292 --> 01:20:44.704
Bowing down is the basic skills

01:20:45.083 --> 01:20:48.780
chick's attitude、widow's treatment、women's pursuit

01:20:52.792 --> 01:20:53.872
What does he do recently

01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:57.078
Reading various business management books

01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.915
Also researching other company's listed plan book

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.582
This is the market survey report I've done

01:21:07.292 --> 01:21:08.657
Adopted the views of all parties

01:21:08.792 --> 01:21:10.453
I think it's not suitable for listing

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:11.789
We need to wait for an opportunity

01:21:11.917 --> 01:21:12.747
What opportunities?

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:13.534
I'm still waiting

01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:14.907
Waiting for a Feng Shui master

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:16.248
We've been waiting for 4 years

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:17.490
During 4 years

01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:19.161
If a new company

01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:19.951
can listed also

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.039
What we do is the education industry

01:21:22.167 --> 01:21:23.657
It can't be blindly listed

01:21:24.125 --> 01:21:25.990
Besides,America market isn't good during recent 2 years

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.661
The U.S listed Chinese companies

01:21:27.792 --> 01:21:28.497
Either suspended

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:29.614
Or broke

01:21:30.208 --> 01:21:31.448
Most became rubbish shares

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:32.868
Junk stocks still is stock

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:37.079
Still have more value than just put billions money in the bank

01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:38.493
Let's ask our shareholders

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:41.116
Can we start listing now

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.788
I propose indefinitely postphone the NEW DREAMS's listing plan

01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:47.698
Who agree with me please raise their hands

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.832
Cheng Dongqing, this is the public opinion

01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:05.619
Today I am going to dictatorship for once

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:08.248

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:10.282

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:12.664

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:14.822

But for international business...

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:24.573

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.285
Xu Wen,I was your student

01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:28.874
Now as the NEW DREAM's listed investment adviser

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.160
You're fired

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:31.618
I'm listening to you

01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:42.198
You fooled everyone

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:45.120
For so many years,don't you feel shame!

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:56.202
Are you finished?

01:22:57.458 --> 01:22:58.823

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.206
She let me know

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:03.450
True love comes quietly without any toss

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:04.906
and I will love you forever

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:22.450
Finally,give you 3 pieces of advice

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:25.581
Never play mahjong with mother in law

01:24:27.958 --> 01:24:31.200
Never sleep with the woman who has more ideas

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:38.662
Don't set up a company with your best friends

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:51.704
I hope everyone today can eat good and drink good,enjoy!

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:53.198

Cheers

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:05.952
Cheers

01:25:19.375 --> 01:25:22.082
I've only had one life

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.411
Not the same with others

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.410
Now I know

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:28.991
The way of life that most people pick

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.240
will be worthwhile

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.619
So I married Li Ping

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.913
I'm so happy,very happy today

01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:41.993
I want to withdraw share

01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:44.577
What?

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:46.989
What did you say?

01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:49.413
I'm done

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:52.197
Meng Xiaojun

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.039
the NEW DREAM can't without you

01:25:55.042 --> 01:25:55.906
I decided

01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:58.873
We've been friends for more than 20 years, man

01:25:59.000 --> 01:25:59.989
Friends?

01:26:00.417 --> 01:26:01.406
You want to talk about feelings

01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:07.909
When we were in school

01:26:08.042 --> 01:26:09.031
I believed once

01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:10.784
I went to America

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:13.158
You guys went to see me off at the airport I beleived once

01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:17.664
Now? I don't believe

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:25.865
Let's talk openly

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:29.535
Remember that dictionary?

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.082
Those words I wrote on that note

01:26:32.208 --> 01:26:33.118
that wasn't for you

01:26:33.833 --> 01:26:34.913
It's for myself

01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:37.911
Sorry to let you misunderstood

01:26:49.333 --> 01:26:50.948
I know,in your mind

01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:52.869
I've always been a

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.911
Stupid hillbilly

01:26:55.667 --> 01:26:57.532
Meng Xiaojun,You carried it too far today

01:26:59.167 --> 01:27:02.364
If not Cheng Dongqing,I wouldn't be friends with you at all

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:06.075
You always think your own business is more important than others

01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:07.990
Do you remember that time

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:12.120
He had tuberculosis,and you said you have to take the TOEFL

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:13.956
You didn't want to see him

01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:16.622
You're so selfish

01:27:17.917 --> 01:27:19.578
So it's because of this

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.035
Since that day

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:23.990
You think I despise you

01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:26.036
So you have been looking for a chance

01:27:26.167 --> 01:27:27.828
to stop me doing one thing

01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:29.289
then give me a lesson

01:27:29.417 --> 01:27:30.247
Right?

01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:32.494
Isn't that interesting,Cheng Dongqing?

01:27:33.375 --> 01:27:33.955
Yep

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:35.243
I think it's interesting

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:36.581
Very interesting

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:37.868
If you want to quit

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.491
I will use 1 million yuan buy your each share,in cash!

01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:42.990
What's your problem?

01:27:44.417 --> 01:27:45.657
What are you talking about?

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.036
You called him back from US at the beginning

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:49.407
He has been worked so hard for company

01:27:49.542 --> 01:27:52.454
and now you're treating him like this,are we still friends?

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:54.414
Am I not?

01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.492
Do you think I doing this for myself?

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.698
Yeah,I'm doing this for myself

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:03.323
At least I admit

01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:04.368
Cut it out, stop

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.832
Maybe you should make a fight like man

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:07.822
Come on,come on

01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:09.744
Make a fight!come on

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:12.157
You metioned quit first

01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:15.249
Something wrong with you since you back from US,why?

01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:16.785
At least I fought for once

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:20.865
And you?got crushed by a US girl

01:28:21.542 --> 01:28:22.748
What did you say?

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:28.240
Stop!

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:33.495
Get away,stop!

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:40.697
Well

01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:42.122
Yes

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:44.073
I'm crazy

01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:45.122
You

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:46.535

01:28:46.667 --> 01:28:47.873
Elite returnees

01:28:48.417 --> 01:28:49.452
You all kickass

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:53.159
Look what we become now

01:28:53.292 --> 01:28:55.533
What we become now

01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:02.249
I've never been a overseas elite

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:03.706
Do you have any idea what did I do in US

01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:04.743
How should I know

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:06.365
I wasn't even a waiter

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.205
I was a handyman

01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:09.198
Even not eligible for tips

01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:10.243
Do you understand?

01:29:11.708 --> 01:29:13.744
I couldn't live any longer, so I'm back

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.490
I have no friends

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:18.953
except you two

01:29:20.417 --> 01:29:21.907
I don't care if you are happy or not

01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:22.906
I've told you everything

01:29:23.042 --> 01:29:23.997
What about you?

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:24.830
Stage fright

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:26.118
I do have this phobia

01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:27.239
I dare not say

01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:29.161
Why don't you ever metion?

01:29:29.292 --> 01:29:31.408
Have you ever disscussed about this with me,are we friends?

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.614
Friends

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.289
Wang Yang,you are wrong

01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:56.284
I used to thought my own business is more important than others

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:01.410
Used to

01:30:04.917 --> 01:30:06.077
I will go to Shen Yang tommorow

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.536
There is a person want to open a private english school

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.331
So many years

01:30:31.083 --> 01:30:32.118
I've been tired everyday

01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:37.159
I did all this for you two

01:30:38.625 --> 01:30:39.785
I've had enough

01:30:41.167 --> 01:30:42.407
Don't want to play no more

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:30.329
I've been numerously wanted to meet her again

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:33.665
I think she would say to me

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:36.408
I'm proud of you today

01:32:52.375 --> 01:32:53.490
Cheng Dongqing

01:32:56.542 --> 01:32:58.783
If we changed the world

01:33:01.125 --> 01:33:03.286
or the world changed us

01:33:31.167 --> 01:33:32.873
president Cheng is coming

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.912
President Cheng,president Cheng

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:39.739
President Cheng, if the success of the NEW DREAM because of the piracy

01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:41.581
President Cheng, rumor says the NEW DREAM because face prosecution

01:33:41.708 --> 01:33:42.538
will suffer large area closures

01:33:42.667 --> 01:33:45.124
If the USA has formally request sealed up the NEW DREAM?

01:34:18.208 --> 01:34:19.789
You haven't been to US,right?

01:34:52.417 --> 01:34:53.907
At least tell me the way

01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:48.532
Let's look for a chinese restaurant

01:35:48.667 --> 01:35:50.953
Great! I miss chinese food

01:35:51.542 --> 01:35:52.452
Come on

01:35:57.833 --> 01:35:58.822
Where are we going?

01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:01.370
Let me take you go a place,western-style food

01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:03.948
This is the place where I used to work

01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:09.830
Yeah,she is the woman

01:36:09.958 --> 01:36:10.947
sometimes

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:14.287
She gave me some small change

01:36:14.417 --> 01:36:16.578
I earn the least

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:22.744
When I frist time came to America

01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:26.242
fed the mice in the lab

01:36:26.875 --> 01:36:27.990
and carried dishes in here

01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:30.331
When I second time came here

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.619
I took our busniess came here

01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:36.331
the busniess I'm proud of

01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:40.413
I want to tell them that I'm not a loser

01:36:42.333 --> 01:36:43.368
But they even...

01:36:45.792 --> 01:36:48.329
They even didn't give you the most basic respect

01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:57.869
They kept checking me up over and over again for a hour

01:36:59.292 --> 01:37:01.999
They still think the people who come to American all want to illegal immigrant

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:22.199
I waited for 6 hours,and drank 8 cups coffee

01:37:33.042 --> 01:37:34.907
At that moment I realized

01:37:35.042 --> 01:37:39.160
We are really too young too naive

01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:47.618
So I think

01:37:49.417 --> 01:37:50.623
Only if

01:37:51.083 --> 01:37:53.745
at the moment when we standing on the NYSE and swinging the hammer

01:37:53.875 --> 01:37:56.287
They will really see you

01:37:56.917 --> 01:37:57.906
Recognize you

01:37:58.667 --> 01:37:59.577

We don't need listed

01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:12.198
I admit I did that for myself

01:38:14.125 --> 01:38:14.830
I'm sorry

01:38:25.042 --> 01:38:26.122

The gift I gave to you last time,actually I don't like it either

01:45:06.208 --> 01:45:08.745
Don't know how do you like this one?

01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:25.822

01:45:27.083 --> 01:45:28.744
I like this one

01:45:54.583 --> 01:45:57.290
Second day,  we went to Vegas

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.533
Cheng Dongqing lost bets till nose bleeding

01:46:00.417 --> 01:46:03.159
Sometimes I still go back

01:46:03.792 --> 01:46:05.657
go back to those bright days

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:17.034
As the host,Su Mei specially invited us to eat a meal

01:46:17.167 --> 01:46:20.079
She told me,the most important thing is not success

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:23.655
But as a man,you can't lose dignity

01:46:24.917 --> 01:46:27.374
That day I had a dream

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.492
Meng Xiaojun from 1980 walked in the street of New York

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.992
He looks so young,so confident

01:46:34.125 --> 01:46:35.740
Just like the sunshine in the street

01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:40.576
Then I told him,  When wrinkles have carved on the forehead

01:46:40.708 --> 01:46:42.164
All you can do is

01:46:42.292 --> 01:46:44.999
Don't let wrinkles engraved in your heart

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:55.866
Cheng Dongqing replaced his sexual life with speech

01:46:56.542 --> 01:46:59.500
Now he doesn't speak like human in public places

01:46:59.833 --> 01:47:00.822
That makes me sick

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:06.332
He turns of the lights not for romance, but for saving money

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:09.199
He never want to change the world

01:47:09.833 --> 01:47:10.663
But at least

01:47:11.208 --> 01:47:13.164
He can make himself not changed by the world

01:47:14.458 --> 01:47:17.495
To be a hillbilly boy forever!
