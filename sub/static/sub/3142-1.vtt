together in years.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.273
I know,
I keep telling her.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.860
Dalia thinks that just because
she loves it here, I have to, too.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.943
- I never said that.
- That's not how it works.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.574
And even if I did,
there's nothing wrong with it.

But you were almost
done, weren't you?

02:48.835 --> 02:51.133
- Yeah, but, it's...
- Hold that, hold that.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.308
I could go back if I want to.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.387

someplace, you know like...

02:58.887 --> 03:00.139
So, yeah.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.850
Wow.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.110
- That's you?
- Yeah.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.563
It's gotten bad.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.195
I thought she'd try to
convert me this morning.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.995
Yeah,
didn't work, though did it?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.072
What does that mean?

03:17.155 --> 03:18.372
Honestly, you can't
blame her, though.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.542
I'm sorry, there weren't
this many ninjas growing up.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.164
You shouldn't call them
ninjas, Yasmine.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.963
- Dalia, in your face, look.
- Don't... stop pointing.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.212
I'm sorry, if my mom dressed
like that, I would be terrified of her.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.964
You're just... you're,
you're rude.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.216
So what, um,
why were you laid off?

03:32.295 --> 03:33.421
What happened exactly?

03:33.505 --> 03:34.677
It wasn't just me.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.758
It was whole round of people.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.771
Some of them had been there for
20 years... it was really, really terrible.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.231
But what about you?

03:43.306 --> 03:46.310
Yalla, tell us things,
come on, how's it going?

03:46.768 --> 03:48.441
- It's going well.
- Yeah?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.524
Ziad's mom's...
been amazing.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.279
She's planned all of it.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.110
Does that annoy you?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.413
No, not at all, she
consults me on all points.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.660
That's great.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.492
I forgot, what does Ziad
teach again?

04:01.575 --> 04:02.918
Contemporary
Islamic Civilization.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.207
Um-hmm..
Important.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.082
I think so.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.556
Mom?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.603
Oh, my God,
it smells so good!

04:31.396 --> 04:32.648
Your favorite.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.525
Hi, Mom.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.860
Come here, May.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.288
How are you?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.619
I'm good, I missed you.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.166
Me too,.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.834
Wow, I'm so glad you're here.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.503
Me too, you look great.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.885
Oh, it's all good.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.629
How was your flight?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.055
It was... you know.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.765
I ate, I slept.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.139
I froze my butt off.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.012
You look pale.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.813
Your eyes are red.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.274
Do you want a nap
before everybody gets here?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.317
I will never fall asleep.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.065
Why do I keep forgetting?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.446
You're exactly like me.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.490
You can't even nap.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.282
I know, me too.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.709
Who's all coming over?

05:29.538 --> 05:30.790
Hmm.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.510
This is great, no,
but I would love some coffee.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.766
- Amazing.
- Oh, I would love some, too.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.770
Did I tell you guys that my paperback
is finally coming out?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.101
That's great.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.269
- Some time this fall.
- That's amazing.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.608
I'm so proud of you.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.108
Thank you.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.696
- Really?
- Hmm.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.156
They can't wait to meet you.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.284
That's so nice.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.920
So...

06:18.378 --> 06:19.721
Everything else is okay?

06:20.005 --> 06:21.257
Yeah.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.340
It's good.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.721
Are you sure?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.052
Yeah.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.514
I got worried when
I heard Ziad wasn't coming.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.142
Never mind how I find out.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.727
I felt it.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.562
I felt that you were
having some problems.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.988
I swear to you.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.155
I told you, May.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.576
Marrying outside your religion,
your culture, it's all the same.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.449
It never works.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.201
We're better than ever, Mom.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.449
We're getting married.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.003
- I just thought...
- He was just delayed.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.756
He'll be here in a few weeks.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.799
Don't worry, I know
you're not coming to the wedding.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.130
Of course not.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.644
What did we talk about?

07:12.724 --> 07:13.976
What?

07:15.727 --> 07:17.729
Have
you talked to dad?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.699
And why do you
call him that?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.321
What am I supposed to call him?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.572
Anything but that.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.700
It's been almost
ten years, Mom.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.826
He had a heart attack.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.532
It barely qualified
for a heart attack.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.037
Even the doctors say so.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.665
He invented the whole thing
just to get attention.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.872
Still, when
I found out, I called him.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.548
And you know why?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.466
Because I am better than him.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.633
You shouldn't
have done that.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.006
I mean, he made
you miserable for years.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.338
20 years.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.931
As if his affairs weren't
enough humiliating,

07:45.006 --> 07:46.849
he went and he
married a woman half his age.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.222
She's not half his age.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.554
May, she is your age, okay?

07:55.392 --> 07:57.486
Are you going to see him?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.812
- No
- Maybe.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.331
You could've warned me.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.917
I asked you not to tell her.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.712
She said something already?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.414
You're surprised?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.379
I'm sorry.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.921
I forgot.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.257
Hmm.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.018
And I... I didn't
think it was a big deal.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.222
Can we clear some of your clothes
so I can have some room?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.648
They're silk,
they need to be hung.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.721
Issam!

09:56.805 --> 09:58.102
How do they know that it
hasn't already been opened?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.001
Hi, my love.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.133

10:35.844 --> 10:40.475

of the whole family

10:40.557 --> 10:42.230
announced I'm going to hell.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.404

so don't worry, we'll rot together.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.631
It's in... ifs in
the dressing room.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.462
No, I got it, stay right
where you are.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.546
In your bag?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.631
Yeah, yeah,
in my purse.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.137
Here.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.804
Thank you, thank you.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.890
Oh, my God, on, my God.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.058
Finally.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.233
<i>I know.</i>

14:11.309 --> 14:12.561
- <i>My God,</i> we <i>speak.</i>
- <i>Can you believe it?</i>

14:12.643 --> 14:15.066
No, why does it gotta
be so hard?

14:15.146 --> 14:17.023
- I miss you.
- <i>I miss you, too.</i>

14:17.106 --> 14:18.779
- How are you?
- I'm good.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.152
I'm at-
I'm at my fitting.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.829
I'm actually wearing my dress.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.156
<i>Nice.</i>

14:24.447 --> 14:25.699
<i>How do you look?</i>

14:25.782 --> 14:28.126
<i>I mean, is it okay to ask?</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:30.370
- Um...
- <i>It's not unlucky or anything.</i>

14:31.287 --> 14:32.539
No.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.797
It's weird, I don't... you know,
I don't feel like myself.

14:36.959 --> 14:41.806
<i>Oh, of course,
you know, that makes sense.</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:44.259
What do you mean it makes sense?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.765
<i>Well, you said, you weren't
sure you wanted to go through with it.</i>

14:46.844 --> 14:49.973
<i>So it makes</i> sense <i>that you wouldn't
feel comfortable in your dress.</i>

14:50.056 --> 14:52.275
May, Issam wants
to take us out tonight.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.023
Oh, come on, come on.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.319
Um, Ziad, hang on one second.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.272
- Yeah, okay.
- That's great, you should go.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.698
No, all of us.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.775
Cool, yeah, I'll be right back.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.747
Ziad, I freaked out.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.998
I'm sorry, it was
the planning, it was the book tour.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.876
It was... it was all
of it at once.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.207
I got scared.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.297
- <i>Okay, I</i> mean...
- I love you so much.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.301
Can we please just chalk this up
to some pre-wedding cliché

15:22.380 --> 15:24.382
and get on with our lives?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.843
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:27.552 --> 15:29.896
<i>Yeah, that's what
we're doing, but okay.</i>

15:29.971 --> 15:33.646
Okay, but you haven't called
me since I... I got here.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.069
<i>You were with your
family, you needed time.</i>

15:37.145 --> 15:39.193
Why do you always think
you know what I need?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.617
<i>Because I know you,
May, better than you know yourself.</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:45.862
Yeah... Well, if that were true,
you'd be here right now.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.071
<i>We talked about this.</i>

15:47.155 --> 15:49.578
<i>We agreed I should</i> teach
<i>and you said it was okay.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:51.580
Of course, I said it was okay,
what else was I gonna say?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.457
<i>Well, how about what you meant?</i>

15:53.536 --> 15:56.881
<i>That would be a start and
it would be helpful.</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:58.925
May?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.343
May, can we go?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.300
I have to get back out there.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.006
Can I call you back later?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.341
<i>Sure.</i>

16:10.928 --> 16:12.180
This is awesome.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.320
Oh, God, my body is like
physically rejecting this place.

I'm gonna... I'll-I'll
see you later.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.460
I didn't think I'd
see you till the wedding.

You know Aunt Hanan

No.

her untying this huge knot.

take you to Hammam.

- Or we could go to the Dead Sea, huh?
- That sounds nice.

23:34.038 --> 23:38.635
They say that if you untie two
pieces of knotted rope,

23:38.709 --> 23:41.713
you're trying to break
the bond between two people.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.674
Who says that?

Are you kidding, that's trashy.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.872
- I don't think so.
- No, it's too sexual.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.375
What are you guys
whispering about?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.675

Mom, you ever think
about getting remarried?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.603
Why, I'm already married.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.556
- Please don't say to God.
- Why not?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.312
- Oh, Jesus.
- Him too.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.236
And don't you poke fun
just because you have no faith.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.654
Who says I don't have any faith.

24:40.729 --> 24:41.821
I have so much faith.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.491
Mom, I hate to break it to you,
but you married another lousy husband.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.658
He's never around.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.370
You can't see Him.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.740
But He's here.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.700
Everywhere.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.377
That's right, I forgot,
He's a ghost.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.956
Why is it so difficult
for you to respect my beliefs?

24:59.039 --> 25:02.919
You're throwing a fit over my wedding
and you wanna talk to me about respect?

25:03.002 --> 25:06.006
May, you don't know what you're
getting yourself into.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.933
Your kids will automatically
considered Muslims, do you know that?

25:10.342 --> 25:13.596
Do you know that if you divorce, you
will never have the right over them?

25:13.679 --> 25:16.353
- We live in the U.S., Mom.
- So what!

25:16.515 --> 25:18.392
He's from here, okay?

25:22.229 --> 25:25.028
Well, then, I guess, I should just
maybe think about converting to Islam

25:25.107 --> 25:27.451
because I'll have more
fights that way.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.614
He's not even
practicing, he's secular.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.997
You don't have to listen to me
if you don't want to.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.205
But I think I have more
experience in the matter than you do.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.961
Mom, you married
the imperialist.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.881
And just because your marriage crumbled,
doesn't mean mine will.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.962
Let's say God doesn't exist.

25:48.047 --> 25:52.143
Do you think you would ever consider
remarrying a human being?

25:53.802 --> 25:56.225
Even if I do, and it's a big if,

25:56.305 --> 25:58.979
where in the world I'll find
someone at my age?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.360
Mom, you're still young.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.779
You don't look anything
like your age.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.861
Plus, we can help, right?

26:06.857 --> 26:08.200
Don't look at me.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.911
Aren't there any
single guys at your church?

26:10.986 --> 26:12.829
I don't go around asking them.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.498
I can ask them.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.706
. Maybe-

26:23.373 --> 26:24.545
Okay...

26:27.211 --> 26:28.463
I'm good, thanks.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.838
I'll come.

26:29.922 --> 26:30.923
Really?

26:31.006 --> 26:32.849
Yes, but only because
I'm curious.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.475
And I'm only gonna go to find you
a husband so don't get your hopes up.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.896
Find me a husband.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.150
And find Jesus at the same time.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.240
♪♪

27:49.418 --> 27:53.844
♪♪

28:43.931 --> 28:45.933
I don't
wanna do it.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.020
Come on.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.154
You can't just wait
out here, you'll roast.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.482
I'm fine.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.775
Dalia, get out of the car.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.654
Open the door.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.072
No.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.417
Come on, he called
like six times.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.745
He wants to see us.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.706
Good for him, let's give him
an award, he remembered that we exist.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.541
He had a heart
attack, Dalia.

29:10.624 --> 29:11.921
Just because he has
a re-awakened conscience,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.844
it doesn't mean that I am
obligated to forgive him.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.173
No one is asking you
to forgive him.

29:17.256 --> 29:21.261
No, but it's even worse,
you're asking me to meet his whore.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.978
Here they are.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.727
Oh, my God, look at you, girls.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.150
I can't believe I'm finally
meeting you.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.309
Get out of the car.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.067
I'm Anu, I think
you all know that.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.359
- I'm May.
- May.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.781
Yes, oh, my God.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.484
Ooh.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.403
I've heard so much about you.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.200
Your dad's so proud of you.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.281
On.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.616
And, um, Dalia?

29:44.700 --> 29:45.747
Come on out.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.170
I've seen so many
pictures of you, come on.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.246
Yeah.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.672
- How are you?
- Good.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.420
You're a
grown-up girl now.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.712
Um, Yasmine, Yasmine, oh.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.385
- You're done.
- You're so beautiful.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.808
Prettier than the pictures,
all of you.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.556
Thank you for coming,
girls, come on in... come.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.308
Of course.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.225
Sorry, your dad had to be in
Jerusalem with Ambassador Williamson,

30:09.308 --> 30:10.560
but he should be
here any minute.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.486
- So we'll get to hang out and, um...
- He's not even here.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.401
Fruit salad?

30:19.109 --> 30:20.110
Yasmine?

30:20.193 --> 30:22.195
- Yes, thank you.
- There you go.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.373
- Thanks.
- Dalia?

30:24.448 --> 30:25.745
Unh-unh.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.076
I'll have hers.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.535
. Okay-

30:28.618 --> 30:29.961
Just something...
for you.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.251
I guess...

30:32.331 --> 30:33.583
<i>Okay.</i>

30:38.253 --> 30:39.505
So...

30:43.550 --> 30:45.223
Where are you from in India?

30:45.302 --> 30:47.851
Oh, I'm originally
from North India.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.474
But I grew up in Mumbai.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.355
I actually lived in
New York, too.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.606
I studied there.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.814
I did not get my work permit so
I decided to move to Dubai.

30:56.897 --> 30:59.776
And that's great, because
that's where I met your dad.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.361
He was living in the hotel
I was managing.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.415
He's got a real
foreign fetish, don't you think?

31:12.412 --> 31:17.134
Um... I hear you have a fiancé
who's Palestinian, right?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.426
Yeah.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.845
- Okay.
- He is.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.213
And?

31:23.715 --> 31:24.716
Does he live here?

31:24.800 --> 31:27.223
Um...
he grew up here.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.606
But he's been in New York
for 15 years now.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.731
I actually saw an
interview of him on the internet.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.031
He is quite a
good-looking guy.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.108
And very well-spoken, too.

31:42.275 --> 31:45.654
He actually reminded me
of Edward the first time I saw him.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.911
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.338
I can't believe how
crazy it's gotten.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.757
There's a complete bottleneck.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.215
I'm so happy you're here.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.297
It started with a
heaviness in my chest.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.803
I thought I maybe had heartburn
or something like that.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.884
Spiciest chicken biryani
does not give him a heartburn.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.767
Ana's the one who insisted
that I go to the hospital.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.520
I come from a family of doctors.

32:13.598 --> 32:17.944
And they say that there's nothing
wrong with me, so, I'm... I'm good.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.487
Thank God.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.564
Yeah.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.240
So tell me
about how you girls are.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.692
I wanna hear about that, so...

32:23.775 --> 32:25.448
You're writing
another book, May.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.912
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.247
- It's a novel.
- What's it about?

32:29.322 --> 32:33.247
Well, it's maybe historical fiction,
I really don't knew yet.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.829
But it's, um, it's
set in 1948 Palestine.

32:35.912 --> 32:39.257
Ed, did you tell her about how
we read her first book?

32:39.332 --> 32:40.584
Oh, that's right.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.211
Anu brought it to me,
she read it before I did.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.638
And I read it twice.

32:44.713 --> 32:45.714
And loved it.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.219
You read it twice?

32:47.299 --> 32:50.929
I didn't quite finish it
the second time but I still intend to.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.639
Because I love it,
it's really clever.

32:53.722 --> 32:57.477
But the real achievement
is the way you have put a human face

32:57.559 --> 33:00.813
on so many of the conflicts in the
region, that's rare, that's...

33:00.896 --> 33:02.148
- It's beautiful.
- I'm so proud of you.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.573
- Thank you.
- Yes.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.197
As I am of you,
Dalia, because I understand

33:06.276 --> 33:08.620
that you're gonna be finishing
massage school.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.114
Actually, no.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.158
I dropped out.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.581
I'm a massage school dropout.

33:16.453 --> 33:19.753
Uh, well, that's probably for
the best because I imagine there isn't

33:19.831 --> 33:22.584
a lot of money in-in that
massage business.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.422
You know, I'm thinking that since
your Mom's here and Anu and I are here,

33:26.505 --> 33:28.849
and you're both looking
for work, huh?

33:29.424 --> 33:31.347
- How do you know that?
- What?

33:31.426 --> 33:34.475
Oh, your mom called
when he was in the hospital.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.558
Yeah, what... she just said
you were laid off.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.400
All's I'm saying is that, you know,
you might wanna consider moving here,

33:42.479 --> 33:44.356
because there's a lot of
opportunity here.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.567
There is, and we'd love
to help you out in any way.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.152
You could work with refugees
in the U.N.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.079
or you could do capacity
building with the embassy.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.454
There's a couple of spots in
the office that I think would be great.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.331
And you'd really might like it.

33:56.409 --> 34:00.255
I think, I personally would rather
shoot myself in the head

34:00.330 --> 34:02.332
than represent
U.S. foreign policies.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.089
Especially in a Middle Eastern
country, I mean...

34:06.628 --> 34:08.630
Tell me
about the wedding.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.799
Your mom is still
boycotting this?

34:11.675 --> 34:15.145
Well, we'll support you,
no matter what, with everything.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.563
- Right, lobster?
- That's right.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.641
We went through
something really very similar.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.398
It all works out.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.193
And don't let anyone
tell you any different.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.940
Dalia, how about some more lamb?

34:29.025 --> 34:30.242
Um...

34:30.318 --> 34:33.663
- Oh, Dalia doesn't...
- Dalia doesn't eat lamb.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.241
Oh, come on, you're
just... teasing me.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.951
Come on, you love lamb, Dalia.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.377
I love lamb, Dad.

34:41.705 --> 34:42.956
Dalia's a vegetarian.

34:44.498 --> 34:45.751
Yup.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.257
How about your dad
and I take you guys somewhere?

34:48.335 --> 34:51.306
Uh, we came here every summer
growing up so...

34:51.380 --> 34:52.724
We've been all over.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.350
There's gotta be
someplace you want to see,

34:54.426 --> 34:56.428
- how about Dami mountains?
- Been there.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.978
You really haven't
said very much about Ziad.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.600
You haven't asked.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.022
All right, let's see.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.105
He is, uh, professor
at Columbia, I know that.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.278
Yeah, he's their Palestinian
expert.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.241
That's impressive.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.285
He's written two books
on the economy of Palestine.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.033
He's working on his third.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.245
He's written all kinds of articles,
essays, op-eds.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.496
He's doing
pretty well for himself.

35:19.576 --> 35:20.668
Yeah.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.417
You sure he's the one?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.833
That's why
I'm marrying him, Dad.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.930
So he must be a pretty
special guy, right?

35:36.885 --> 35:38.228
You still playing tennis?

35:39.054 --> 35:40.397
It's been a while.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.857
Good, that's the way
I like to play you.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.275
You wanna play tomorrow?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.984
I can't tomorrow, but
I'd love to play.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.663
You could've told me
you'd be gone for the whole day.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.085
I needed the car.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.712
- We didn't know.
- Sorry.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.760
You must be hungry.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.254
- Yes.
- No.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.844
We stopped at Uncle Waleed's...

36:15.715 --> 36:17.388
Maram fed us a little.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.813
What's wrong?

36:30.397 --> 36:31.614
It's not good?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.488
- No, it's really good.
- Thank you, Mom.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.909
Mm-hmm.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.657
So what did Maram cook?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.824
Leg of lamb.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.459
It was really dry.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.392
♪♪

37:48.057 --> 37:49.525
That's so cute.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.461
I'm not thinking
holy thoughts.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.545
Okay.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.380
I never thought
I would hook up here.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.182
Yesterday, we made out in
the elevator for two hours.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.477
- Does he live with his parents?
- Yeah, they all do here.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.555
Now I know why they get
married so young so they can get laid...

39:50.638 --> 39:51.890
- Shh.
- Hmm?

39:52.473 --> 39:53.725
What about him?

39:54.017 --> 39:55.269
He's married.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.568
He's cute.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.199
That could come right off, Mom.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.073
If I'm gonna do it again,
I better do it right.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.870
He has to be a Palestinian Christian.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.290
And he has to know how to
cook and do laundry,

40:09.365 --> 40:13.711
And if he has to travel,
he better travel for fun and not for work.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.335
All right, well, you're gonna have
better luck at the second coming.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.008
But Jesus has facial hair
so that's gonna be a problem.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.670
We don't make fun of Jesus.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.200
One minute.

42:17.994 --> 42:18.995
Hello?

42:19.078 --> 42:20.079
<i>- May?</i>
- Yeah.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.881
- It? A878.
- Hi.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.293
Oh... I- I can't
talk right now.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.254
<i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

42:27.879 --> 42:29.131
I...

42:29.589 --> 42:30.841
I just, uh...

42:32.383 --> 42:33.635
Is everything okay?

42:34.594 --> 42:36.938
<i>I promised I was not gonna cry.</i>

42:37.055 --> 42:39.774
<i>Yeah, um... May,
can i...</i>

42:39.849 --> 42:42.853
<i>Can I just take
you out for a coffee?</i>

42:42.977 --> 42:44.650
Something wrong with Dad?

42:44.729 --> 42:47.949
I have this terrible feeling,
May, the same one I had when,

42:48.024 --> 42:50.368

What are you doing out here?

58:36.680 --> 58:37.932
Where's Tamer?

58:38.223 --> 58:39.566
Having a work crisis.

58:40.142 --> 58:41.394
That sucks.

58:41.476 --> 58:45.481
Well, at least we get to
spend some time to ourselves, right?

58:46.106 --> 58:48.108
We always have time
to ourselves.

59:08.670 --> 59:12.015

as I do, Yasmine.

59:12.924 --> 59:15.268
I do not speak
shitty Arabic, okay?

59:15.635 --> 59:17.182
I took two years in college.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.263
So what?

59:18.346 --> 59:19.438
I taught myself how to read.

59:19.514 --> 59:21.016
You have to sound things
out like a child.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.396
Which is
more than you can say.

59:22.476 --> 59:23.773
- Excuse me?
- I understand the meanings

59:23.852 --> 59:25.729

Excuse me?

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.606
You're defending him?

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.109
You're being unfair.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.453
What do you know?

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.572
Just trying to help.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.453
Well, I don't
need your help, okay?

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.126
Why don't you go flirt with
the bartender some more?

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.419
Okay, I think I should go.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:47.746
No, no, stay.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.457
What the hell was
that supposed to mean?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.089
It means you seem a little
confused, lately.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:56.297
Why, because I'm actually friendly
to people and not bitchy, like you.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.131
Is that what you
call that, being friendly?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.717
Well, maybe you should stop
being so friendly.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.767
I mean, people might
get the wrong impression.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.845
You are getting married,
aren't you?

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.647
That's right,
run away like you always do.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.728
Run and hide, that's the answer.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:15.574
Hi, my name is May
and my life is perfect.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.492
And you're all the fucked-up ones.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.240
What do you want, Yasmine?

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.492
I wanna know
why Ziad isn't here?

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.869
And I wanna know why you don't give
a shit about your wedding?

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:25.872
Because I don't know
that I wanna go through with it.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.248
Well, then why didn't
you tell us?

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:28.328
Tell you what?

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.913
I don't even
know what to tell myself.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.464
Wouldn't it help to
talk about it?

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:33.462
And risk
the whole world finding out?

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.509
- No.
- Come on, that is such bullshit.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.337
Yasmine, Yasmine?

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.640
Did you tell Tamer that I'm gay?

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:42.468
Dalia,
now's not the time.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:46.054
His friend Chati just outed himself to me
because he thinks that I'm gay.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.184
Aren't you?

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.607
That's not the point.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.314
Are you going around
and just telling everybody?

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.067
What am I supposed to
do, okay, lie?

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.316
Who I do or do net sleep
with is rue-body's business, okay?

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.525
See big mouth?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.155
So, what, you think I
can't be trusted.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.236
- You can't be.
- You can't be.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:02.366
I wasn't talking to you.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.243
How could you tell
people that, how can I trust you?

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.539
You are always telling
people things.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.788
If you knew something was
wrong, why didn't you say anything?

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:08.914
Don't blame us?

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.668
How were we supposed to know you're
thinking of calling the whole thing off.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.747
Wait, What?

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:13.832
I thought you were
gonna wait till Ziad got here.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.588
I'm not calling it off.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.344
You told Dalia?

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.218
You told Dalia
and you didn't tell me.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.385
I told Dalia this morning while
you were busy making out

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.095
with your boyfriend,
thank you very much.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.647
But I'm really glad to know that
that's all you care about.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.316
You wonder why
I can't talk to you?

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:32.859
You have never been
happy for me.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.186
- Excuse me?
- Either of you.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.270
Whoa, what?

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:38.197
No, you wish you were
the one getting married and you...

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.866
don't think anyone should
get married.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:40.942
I never said that, May.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.744
Gays don't have the same
rights, I get it.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.662
Gays, what is
wrong with you people.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.160
Why do you think I'm gay?

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.082
'Cause you haven't had a
boyfriend in ten years.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.911
So what... I'm so sorry
to disappoint all of you.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:54.248
And you know what, even if someone
is, I mean, there's nothin wrong...

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.753
I never said there was!

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.006
I only told Tamer because I was
proud to have a sister who was a lesbian.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.758
I am not a lesbian!

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.037
I saw your mom.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.288
We went to the wedding planner

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:34.042
and he was showing us
the reception hall.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:39.293
And I just kept thinking
I don't know how to do this.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:40.919
<i>You're-you're upset,
okay.</i>

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.718
Just listen to me, Ziad.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.307
<i>You need a break from
your family.</i>

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.730
<i>They're making you crazy.</i>

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.519
Well, then, we're all crazy.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:57.068
<i>Okay, I'm gonna he there in
a few days, all right?</i>

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.736
<i>We'll figure all of this out.</i>

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.064
. May?

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:04.777
Mom called.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:07.738
<i>May?</i>

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.080

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.623

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.041
Oh, my goodness.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.333
. Dad?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.669
Hey, Dad, hi.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.045
Was it another
heart attack?

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:28.175
Well, they did some
tests and we'll hear in a little bit.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.101
Good to see you...

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.054
Nice to meet you.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.140
I heard so much about you.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:36.600
No, you too.

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:39.894
Not all bad things, I hope.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.272
No.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:46.326
Girls, it's so nice to
see you again.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:49.075
I only wish it was
under different circumstances.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:53.830
That's right, you had lunch together
and you cooked a leg of lamb, right?

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.788
It's hard to make
it tender, don't you think?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.300
Dad, uh, when did it happen,
exactly, like what happened?

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.177
I was playing tennis.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.471
It was way too
hot to be playing tennis.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.470
Do you remember when
you two used to play?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.347
Yeah, you hated
it when we played.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:12.928
'Cause you got so
competitive.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:15.264
I thought you were
going to kill each other.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:20.443
Oh, you know, it was... I guess I was
sweating a little bit more than usual.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:24.239
I kept playing and then
all of a sudden, I got really cold.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.566
Everything went white.

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.697
I wasn't feeling any pain.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.245
Could it be, this is the end?

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.077
Not too bad way to go.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.409
Wham, chest pains kicked in.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.706
I was at home when
I got the call.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:43.462
I don't know
what I would have done.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.918
Are you hungry?

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.799
Are they feeding you well?

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.594
Anu brought me some
chicken soup from the cafeteria.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:54.849
Which was very good, because I got my first
meal, and what was it: Salmon.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.021
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.148
I can't believe
they brought you salmon.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.567
I'll talk to them.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.026
- Okay.
- I already did.

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.148
Well, that's good.
