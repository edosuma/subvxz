00:02.020 --> 00:04.454
<i>All aboard, for safety and adventure!</i>

00:04.623 --> 00:06.989
<i>On the rigid airship Excelsior...</i>

00:07.159 --> 00:09.491
<i>... where the pampered
luxury of a cruise ship...</i>

00:09.661 --> 00:12.152
<i>... meets the smoothness
of modern air travel.</i>

00:12.331 --> 00:16.165
<i>Yes, when you fly Excelsior,
you're flying in style!</i>

00:16.335 --> 00:17.825
<i>- And safety!
Safety?</i>

00:18.003 --> 00:20.836
<i>- But isn't hydrogen flammable?
- And how, Timmy!</i>

00:21.006 --> 00:23.236
<i>That's why Excelsior is filled with safe...</i>

00:23.409 --> 00:26.845
<i>... natural helium.
Why, it's actually flame-retardant!</i>

00:27.012 --> 00:28.741
<i>- Neat!
- And safe!</i>

00:28.914 --> 00:32.077
<i>So, whether you're enjoying
Excelsior's majestic vistas...</i>

00:32.250 --> 00:35.186
<i>... duty-free shopping,
high-stakes baccarat...</i>

00:35.354 --> 00:37.083
<i>... dancing with your lovely wife...</i>

00:37.256 --> 00:40.350
<i>... or even a cigar after
a French gourmet dinner...</i>

00:40.526 --> 00:44.018
<i>... you'll be enjoying them in style.
And safety!</i>

00:44.196 --> 00:47.256
<i>- All aboard Excelsior!
God.</i>

00:47.433 --> 00:48.900
Who'd wanna put a bomb on that?

00:49.067 --> 00:51.194
That's what we're hoping
ISIS can find out.

00:51.370 --> 00:55.397
No, why bother? Some broad gets on there
with a staticky sweater, and boom, it's:

00:55.574 --> 00:58.236
"Oh, the humanity!"

00:58.410 --> 00:59.900
- No, no, that...
- Sterling.

01:00.078 --> 01:01.602
Were you watching some other
commercial just now?

01:01.780 --> 01:03.441
It's a rigid airship.

01:03.615 --> 01:06.948
- Filled with helium.
- Which is non-flammable! Dumb-ass.

01:07.119 --> 01:09.849
I thought our promotional
video covered that fairly well.

01:10.022 --> 01:12.582
Oh, and how. Sterling, it's totally safe.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.692
Well, except for the bomb threat.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.191
No, not to worry, dear.

01:16.361 --> 01:19.353
ISIS won't let terrorists
blow up your lovely blimp.

01:19.531 --> 01:22.193
- Rigid airship.
- My top two agents will be on board.

01:22.367 --> 01:25.097
- Nope!
- And I will oversee the operation...

01:25.270 --> 01:29.536
personally from what I assume
will be first-class accommodations.

01:29.708 --> 01:31.608
Oh, actually we are fully booked.

01:31.777 --> 01:34.575
Well, if you think, oh, I don't know...

01:34.746 --> 01:38.773
this "Trudy Beekman" person
can thwart a major terror plot.

01:38.951 --> 01:40.942
I suppose we could bump Mrs. Beekman.

01:41.119 --> 01:43.610
- Bump me, I'm not going.
- Lf these two share a cabin.

01:43.789 --> 01:46.257
- Nope!
- Not going to let the terrorists win!

01:46.425 --> 01:48.723
- We'll pose as husband and wife!
- Nope!

01:48.894 --> 01:51.795
Cyril would totally freak.
Malory, let me stay with you.

01:51.964 --> 01:53.625
We'll do the whole
Oprah-Gayle thing.

01:53.799 --> 01:56.495
Nope! I need a stateroom to myself...

01:56.668 --> 02:00.764
in case I have a gentleman caller.
- Um...

02:00.939 --> 02:02.600
- Mother, please.
- Please...

02:02.774 --> 02:05.072
do not make me do this.
- But Lana...

02:05.244 --> 02:07.576
think of the innocent
lives you'll be saving.

02:07.746 --> 02:10.613
And also the fact
that this is a direct order.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.647
At least tell me it's separate beds.

02:13.318 --> 02:14.945
- Um... Hmm.
Ugh.

02:15.187 --> 02:16.654
Lana.

02:16.822 --> 02:18.380
Lana.

02:18.724 --> 02:20.282
Lana!

02:20.659 --> 02:22.286
- Lana!
- What?

02:24.429 --> 02:25.691
Danger zone!

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

02:57.863 --> 03:01.663
Terrible, awful, just gut-wrenchingly
bad feeling about this.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.495
Baby, I really need you to trust me.
Okay, now...

03:04.670 --> 03:07.571
is the cabin small? Yes.
And yet...

03:07.739 --> 03:11.072
surprising amount of storage.
- Ugh. And I'll hardly be in here, okay?

03:11.243 --> 03:14.337
I've got a terrorist to find,
and I doubt he's hiding under...

03:14.513 --> 03:16.504
- What's basically a twin bed.
- Archer.

03:16.682 --> 03:20.118
Since it's all drawers under here,
because look how tiny this room is!

03:20.285 --> 03:24.187
- Oh, my God, it's like a broom closet.
- And yet, a surprising amount of storage.

03:24.356 --> 03:26.324
Oh, shut up, and Cyril?

03:26.491 --> 03:29.483
- Very eager to know why you're still here.
- He was just...

03:29.661 --> 03:33.028
- Just helping Lana get settled.
- Trust me, Cyril. She already settled.

03:33.198 --> 03:34.756
- Hey!
- Hey!

03:34.933 --> 03:37.026
Disembark, Cyril. We're about to...

03:37.202 --> 03:39.796
launch, or whatever blimps do.

03:39.972 --> 03:42.668
Yeah, what does a blimp do, Pam?

03:42.841 --> 03:44.706
Uh... Kick your skinny ass?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.367
Now come on, we gotta
get off this thing before...

03:47.546 --> 03:50.947
Relax! God, we've got half an hour.

03:51.116 --> 03:55.212
Oh. Well then,
make me a double Campari and, uh...

03:55.921 --> 03:57.388
I guess vodka?

03:58.056 --> 04:01.287
- We don't normally drink on the bridge.
- Well, I don't normally fly...

04:01.460 --> 04:03.223
on the Hindenburg 2.0.
- It's not...

04:03.395 --> 04:06.387
Cyril doesn't normally storm off
without even kissing me goodbye!

04:06.565 --> 04:08.556
We're all out of our comfort zone.

04:08.734 --> 04:12.101
- Not me, my stateroom is gorgeous.
- Oh.

04:12.270 --> 04:16.570
That, what's her name, Beekman?
I bet she's just sick she got bumped.

04:16.742 --> 04:18.801
Yes, she literally vomited from anger.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.502
So if we could just focus
on the bomb threat?

04:21.680 --> 04:22.806
How about crew members?

04:22.981 --> 04:25.313
- Anyone who might be disgruntled?
- Um...

04:28.654 --> 04:29.951
That's Lieutenant Krauss.

04:30.122 --> 04:32.818
He and I were both up
for command of the Excelsior, but...

04:32.991 --> 04:35.289
You got it. Leaving him with motive.

04:35.460 --> 04:37.394
Release the mooring cable!

04:37.562 --> 04:39.996
Come on!
It's not Larry Luftwaffe, that's...

04:40.165 --> 04:41.792
Oopsie. Ha-ha-ha.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.559
- Ugh, way too obvious.

04:43.735 --> 04:46.397
God damn it! We're moving!

04:46.571 --> 04:49.131
- I know!
- What happened to half an hour?

04:49.307 --> 04:50.934
- I lied!
- What?

04:51.109 --> 04:53.134
Why the hell are you two still here?

04:53.311 --> 04:57.247
Because I knew you'd be here, because
you don't trust Lana with Mr. Archer.

04:57.416 --> 04:58.940
No! No, now that is...

04:59.117 --> 05:01.176
- So ironic, Cyril!
Ugh.

05:01.353 --> 05:03.344
- Especially in light of recent...
No.

05:03.522 --> 05:07.982
Rug-burny events.
- Oh, my God!

05:08.160 --> 05:09.457
You two banged?

05:09.628 --> 05:13.428
L... Uh... See, here's the thing...

05:13.598 --> 05:17.466
- Fruit basket!
- Wow. You are just a dog in a manger.

05:17.636 --> 05:19.570
I don't know what that means, Pam.

05:19.738 --> 05:22.536
- I didn't grow up on a cheese farm.
- Oh, for the...

05:22.708 --> 05:25.040
It's called a dairy.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.872
Even a hint of a problem
on our maiden voyage...

05:28.046 --> 05:29.809
would kill Excelsior's stock price.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.245
So, Lana, canvas the passengers
and crew...

05:32.417 --> 05:35.545
learn what you can about Krauss...
- But please, be discreet!

05:35.721 --> 05:38.918
Hey, good advice!
Which maybe I'll just sort of fold in...

05:39.091 --> 05:41.719
with my 12 years of experience
as a covert operative.

05:41.893 --> 05:44.453
Don't be snotty.
And Sterling, if there is a bomb...

05:44.629 --> 05:47.792
Captain, dear, where would
it do the most damage?

05:47.966 --> 05:50.457
- Probably in...
- This new place called anywhere?

05:50.635 --> 05:52.694
- This whole thing's a bomb. Jesus!
- It's not...

05:52.871 --> 05:55.305
- Wanna blow us all to shit, Sherlock?
- Ow!

05:55.474 --> 05:57.066
- Sterling!
- For the last time...

05:57.242 --> 06:00.871
the Excelsior is filled
with non-flammable helium!

06:01.046 --> 06:03.241
Although this is a non-smoking area, sir.

06:03.415 --> 06:05.315
Damn it, he's a prospective investor!

06:05.484 --> 06:08.976
Not after that, I bet. And forget
about Krauss. There's your bomber.

06:09.154 --> 06:12.453
- Who? What?
That guy. Beardsley McTurbanhead.

06:12.624 --> 06:16.219
You idiot. That's Sandu Singh,
the billionaire investor!

06:16.394 --> 06:18.453
- He's a Sikh!
- Oh, so if he's not a Muslim...

06:18.630 --> 06:19.722
he just gets a pass?

06:19.898 --> 06:22.332
That's called profiling,
Mother, and I don't do it.

06:22.501 --> 06:25.402
- Singh is Excelsior's majority shareholder.
- So?

06:25.570 --> 06:29.062
If anything went wrong on this flight,
he'd lose millions.

06:29.241 --> 06:30.708
- It's a perfect cover.
- Sterling.

06:30.876 --> 06:32.366
Just look for the stupid bomb.

06:32.544 --> 06:35.536
Relax. What do we have, like,
four hours before we get to London?

06:35.714 --> 06:38.979
- Sterling, are you joking?
- The crossing takes 24 hours.

06:39.151 --> 06:41.085
- Are you joking? What?
- Rigid airships...

06:41.253 --> 06:43.244
combine the pampering
of a cruise ship...

06:43.421 --> 06:46.857
with the speed of...
- Some other, slightly faster ship?

06:47.025 --> 06:49.721
Uh... Hello, airplanes? Yeah, it's blimps.

06:49.895 --> 06:52.125
You win, bye! Oh, God.

06:52.297 --> 06:56.529
- I hope you didn't invest in this.
- It'll be fine, though.

06:56.701 --> 06:59.169
As long as nothing
goes wrong on this flight.

06:59.337 --> 07:02.272
Oh, captain, my captain...

07:02.440 --> 07:05.932
with ISIS on board,
what could possibly go wrong?

07:06.111 --> 07:07.169
Pick one!

07:07.345 --> 07:11.145
Either A, I tell Lana what happened
on that scratchy green office rug...

07:11.316 --> 07:13.216
or two, you get inside me.

07:13.385 --> 07:15.819
Or C, maybe I just jam this mop...

07:15.987 --> 07:17.750
into the engine and kill all of us.

07:17.923 --> 07:20.391
- I don't think that's how blimps work.
- Darn, right.

07:20.559 --> 07:22.288
We'd just sort of float around.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.429
Stupid naturally safe helium!

07:25.597 --> 07:27.895
But I am liking the jamming imagery.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.831
- And the killing.
- And are you just gonna sit there?

07:32.003 --> 07:33.903
Yeah, until she tags me in!

07:34.072 --> 07:36.563
- What?
- I'm kidding!

07:36.741 --> 07:38.834
My back's all messed up.

07:41.646 --> 07:44.444
So you're ruining Cyril's life because...

07:44.616 --> 07:48.609
in your "dream the impossible dream"
world, it'll make Mr. Archer jealous?

07:48.787 --> 07:52.279
Oh, Pamela. You read me like a poem.

07:52.457 --> 07:56.450
Yeah? What's the poem gonna be about
when Cyril snaps and murders you?

07:56.628 --> 07:59.791
I don't know. World's gushiest orgasm?

07:59.965 --> 08:03.298
Can you just get out of the way!

08:03.468 --> 08:05.129
- What, are you gonna shoot me again?
- Yes!

08:05.303 --> 08:07.362
Oh. Well, then hang on.

08:07.539 --> 08:10.736
Cyril's already freaked out enough
about us sharing this shoebox...

08:10.909 --> 08:13.469
without you air-drying your
unkempt bush.

08:13.645 --> 08:16.375
Unkempt bush? You're one to talk.

08:16.548 --> 08:21.485
Ah. My vulva is smoother
than a veal cutlet.

08:21.653 --> 08:23.314
- With terrible timing.
- Oh, really.

08:23.488 --> 08:25.456
- Baby...
- Did I interrupt something?

08:25.624 --> 08:27.956
Oh... Rehearsal with your
Commodores tribute band?

08:28.126 --> 08:31.152
Archer! Cyril, what are you doing here?

08:31.329 --> 08:33.524
I wanted to tell you
something very important...

08:33.698 --> 08:37.895
but apparently you're too busy
showing off your vealy vulva!

08:38.068 --> 08:41.869
Cyril! You know, your whole
trust thing, and I've tried to, okay?

08:42.039 --> 08:44.167
Okay, you know what?
We are on a break!

08:44.342 --> 08:45.366
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

08:45.543 --> 08:48.307
- Well, that's fine by me.
- Cyril, wait.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.913
No running!
Shut up.

08:50.081 --> 08:52.413
- Oh, my God, what have l...
- What're you doing? Go after him!

08:52.584 --> 08:55.314
- Oh. You think I should?
- Yes!

08:55.487 --> 08:56.977
We're almost out of fruit.

08:57.155 --> 09:00.454
Which is why I find it strange
that you're so incredibly calm.

09:00.625 --> 09:04.527
Well, that seaweed wrap
just slurps out the stress.

09:04.696 --> 09:08.393
Can't wait to tell
Trudy Beekman all about it.

09:08.566 --> 09:11.000
Lf, um, we ever meet.

09:11.169 --> 09:13.535
- What about you? Anything on Krauss?
- No. Shut up.

09:13.705 --> 09:16.538
- Have you seen Cyril?
- What? Why would I have?

09:16.708 --> 09:18.369
- And what the hell is he doing?
- Hey!

09:18.543 --> 09:20.875
- What'd I tell you, huh? Huh?
- Ow! Uhn!

09:21.046 --> 09:22.877
There! Go buy a nicotine patch!

09:27.218 --> 09:30.346
- Gentlemen.
- No, no, no, what happened to discretion?

09:30.522 --> 09:33.685
- What happened to that bartender?
- Right? Guy sees an empty glass...

09:33.858 --> 09:36.850
and all of a sudden he's Judge Crater.
- Oh, for God's sake!

09:37.028 --> 09:38.723
Nigel, some chips for mister?

09:38.897 --> 09:41.388
Archer. Ha. Sterling Archer.

09:41.566 --> 09:44.296
The minimum bet is ten thousand, sir.
Dollars.

09:44.469 --> 09:47.529
I stuffed all my money
in that guy's mouth, because...

09:47.706 --> 09:51.005
Well, perhaps we could play
for something much more interesting.

09:51.176 --> 09:54.441
Yeah, cause that was seriously, like,
all the cash I had on me, so.

09:54.612 --> 09:59.140
So if I win, I spend a night
of passion with your exquisite wife.

09:59.317 --> 10:03.014
- My wi...? Oh, yes, my wife, of course.
- Oh!

10:03.188 --> 10:05.816
Yeah, that's a deal! But if I win...

10:05.991 --> 10:09.586
you tell me where the bomb... What?
- Baccarat! Mr. Singh wins.

10:09.761 --> 10:12.889
- Wait, wait, wait, we were going?
- The von Zeppelin suite.

10:13.064 --> 10:15.931
I shall expect her within the hour.

10:16.101 --> 10:18.831
She's not gonna be happy about that.
Um...

10:19.004 --> 10:20.835
What, are you mostly paid in tips?

10:21.006 --> 10:23.600
- Almost entirely, sir.
- Heh.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.567
Ahem. Mm-hm.

10:26.745 --> 10:28.610
Well, whose fault is that?

10:28.780 --> 10:30.805
Prancing around in your Fiacci knockoffs...

10:30.982 --> 10:33.576
blathering about your vulva.
- Hey, first of all...

10:33.752 --> 10:37.518
I'm just saying! You're driving
Cyril straight toward another woman.

10:37.689 --> 10:39.987
Cyril? With another woman?

10:40.158 --> 10:42.592
Malory, seriously. Look at me.

10:42.761 --> 10:44.820
Look at me! Look at and choke me!

10:46.197 --> 10:49.064
- Oh, yes, yes! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, what am I doing?

10:49.234 --> 10:51.600
- Ruining your life, you idiot.
- Ha-ha-ha.

10:51.770 --> 10:54.330
And making it hard to drop a deuce.

10:55.407 --> 10:58.240
- Uh... I'm sorry, what?
- You. Now. Led Zeppelin suite.

10:58.410 --> 11:00.139
You have no proof Singh's the bomber.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.778
- He hinted...
- That's profiling.

11:01.946 --> 11:04.073
That the proof was in his cabin!
- Really?

11:04.249 --> 11:06.342
Yes! So go down there and find it...

11:06.518 --> 11:10.477
while I go find the bomb.
- Ugh. Bombs, bombers, vulvas.

11:10.655 --> 11:12.987
- You people are just ruining my trip.
Uh...

11:13.158 --> 11:14.989
Well, don't stand here gaping at me!

11:15.160 --> 11:17.492
Go thwart something!

11:21.466 --> 11:23.832
- No running!
- Zip it, Zipperface!

11:24.002 --> 11:28.371
Oh. Kidding, sorry. Hey, have you
seen that nerdy fruit-basket steward?

11:28.540 --> 11:30.474
Check the Kaiser Wilhelm suite.

11:30.642 --> 11:33.702
You really need new names on...
Hey, what were you doing in there?

11:33.878 --> 11:36.210
Things for authorized personnel only!

11:36.381 --> 11:38.645
So don't go in there. It's verboten!

11:38.817 --> 11:41.980
Ah. Okay. Probably merits a follow-up.

11:42.153 --> 11:43.586
Archer?
- Cyril? What're you...?

11:43.755 --> 11:46.485
Archer, I need your help!
I think I'm losing it here, man!

11:46.658 --> 11:49.991
What gave it away, my mother's...?
Why are you wearing my mother's robe?

11:50.161 --> 11:52.220
- I can explain.
- I don't think I want you to.

11:52.397 --> 11:55.833
- See, it all started when you and Lana...
- Cyril! You should tell her this.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.731
I tried! But you were naked
and it was all vulva this, and vulva that.

11:59.904 --> 12:04.739
Yeah, and as you're standing here, dick and
or balls caressed by my mother's robe, ugh...

12:04.909 --> 12:07.400
Lana is waiting for you.
- Really? Where?

12:07.579 --> 12:09.774
The Led Zeppelin suite.

12:10.281 --> 12:13.648
- There's a von Zeppelin suite.
- Which I'm sure is what I meant. So, go!

12:13.818 --> 12:16.685
- Thanks, Archer! You're the best!
- I know.

12:19.557 --> 12:23.254
So yes, the bottom line is that
I was unfaithful to you.

12:23.428 --> 12:27.364
Two... Well, three times, I guess,
if a dry-humpy choker counts.

12:27.532 --> 12:30.330
And if you can't see
it in your heart to forgive me...

12:30.502 --> 12:33.403
I will forgive you.
Because that's what love is, Lana.

12:33.571 --> 12:34.936
It's forgivey.

12:35.106 --> 12:38.439
Which is not a word. Come on, Figgis!
All right, here we go.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.613
- Oh, why?
- Hello!

12:43.781 --> 12:48.013
- So, that's your idea of a break, huh?
- Cyril! It's not what it looks like!

12:48.186 --> 12:50.654
Well, then, what is it?

12:50.822 --> 12:55.054
Okay, so Cyril got in over his head.
- Jesus, God, did he kill her?

12:55.226 --> 12:58.286
No, no, no, he ran from her!
To go confess to Lana...

12:58.463 --> 13:01.990
but so then this one starts freaking out,
and long story short...

13:02.167 --> 13:04.931
I kinda had to drown her in the tub.
- So you killed her?

13:06.471 --> 13:08.962
Apparently not, so...

13:09.140 --> 13:10.835
good news.
Shut up, Pam.

13:11.009 --> 13:13.443
Did Cyril run by here
crying in a woman's bathrobe?

13:13.611 --> 13:16.842
Well, it wouldn't surprise me.
You're driving him stark raving mad.

13:17.015 --> 13:19.074
- What'd I do?
- What'd you do?

13:19.250 --> 13:21.514
Running around all up
and down this stupid blimp.

13:21.686 --> 13:24.348
- Against the rules.
- Half-naked, tits bouncing around...

13:24.522 --> 13:27.787
like you're at a rodeo,
then going back to some billionaire's suite?

13:27.959 --> 13:33.864
- I was trying to stop a bomb plot.
- Oh, my God, there is no bomb!

13:34.032 --> 13:36.660
- More good news.
- And just how do you know that?

13:36.834 --> 13:38.131
Ugh.

13:38.303 --> 13:40.931
Because I made the bomb threat!

13:41.105 --> 13:44.632
Trudy Beekman booked the very last
ticket on this flight, so it was all:

13:44.876 --> 13:47.310
"Meh, meh, meh. I'm Trudy Beekman.

13:47.478 --> 13:52.347
I'm on the co-op board
and I'm going on a blimp! Meh!"

13:52.517 --> 13:56.681
- So, yes, I made a phony bomb threat.
- Good for you.

13:57.188 --> 13:58.621
And yet you lecture me. Lovely.

13:59.991 --> 14:02.653
<i>Hello?
- So, what would you say if I told you...</i>

14:02.827 --> 14:04.692
that your mother made
a phony bomb threat...

14:04.862 --> 14:08.457
<i>...just to get a free ride on a blimp?
- I'd say that's fairly classic her?</i>

14:08.633 --> 14:10.760
<i>- Oh, shut up.
- And then I'd just sorta laugh...</i>

14:10.935 --> 14:13.802
at the, uh...
The whatchamacallit.

14:15.206 --> 14:16.605
Irony.

14:20.578 --> 14:23.274
<i>There's actually a bomb on board?
Archer?</i>

14:23.448 --> 14:27.179
Archer? Oh, what the hell?
Where the **** are you going?

14:27.352 --> 14:30.753
Gotta get my turtleneck.
I'm not defusing a bomb in this!

14:30.922 --> 14:32.253
- No running!
Shut up!

14:32.423 --> 14:35.449
Oh, and Lana, maybe you ought to
grab the Kraut. He's the bomber.

14:37.595 --> 14:39.859
What is this?
You know what it is, Fritz!

14:40.031 --> 14:42.693
- So shut your schnitzel-hole and disarm it.
- Oh.

14:42.867 --> 14:46.064
<i>I get it. The German guy mit a scar...</i>

14:46.237 --> 14:49.900
must be the bad guy.
Well, you know how I got this scar?

14:50.074 --> 14:52.941
Saving a Jewish girl
from a gang of skinheads.

14:53.111 --> 14:57.207
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah! And so Krauss gets a curb party.

14:57.382 --> 14:59.680
- Wow. Now I feel like an asshole.
- Your words.

14:59.851 --> 15:01.785
But could you be a lamb
and disarm it anyway?

15:01.953 --> 15:02.977
Yeah, probably.

15:04.355 --> 15:07.381
Okay, got the turtleneck
and my wire cutters. Now where are we?

15:07.558 --> 15:10.618
We're at you just shot the guy
who could disarm the bomb, jackass!

15:10.795 --> 15:12.228
What...? I didn't shoot him!

15:12.397 --> 15:15.594
- You think I'd bring a gun on this firetrap?
- Then who did it?

15:15.767 --> 15:18.395
- I did!
Captain Lammers!

15:18.569 --> 15:19.866
Nice read, Velma.

15:20.038 --> 15:22.700
"Keep your 401 K in company stock,"
they said.

15:22.874 --> 15:24.933
"The price can only go up," they said!

15:25.109 --> 15:27.942
- Well, guess what!
- Um, it didn't?

15:28.112 --> 15:30.706
Who the hell wants
a two-day blimp ride to London?

15:30.882 --> 15:34.545
- Which is our only route!
- Okay, so it's a niche market, but...

15:34.719 --> 15:37.210
Blowing it up will send
the stock price down to zero.

15:37.388 --> 15:39.117
Yeah, that's why I shorted it!

15:39.290 --> 15:41.588
- But what about all the other employees?
- Um...

15:41.759 --> 15:46.128
- See? It's that kinda selfish shit...
- Lana, no! You'll kill us all!

15:46.297 --> 15:50.631
For the last time, you idiot!
It's not hydrogen...

15:50.802 --> 15:52.133
it's helium!

15:53.871 --> 15:56.396
And what about that are
you still not getting, exactly?

15:56.574 --> 15:58.599
Well, obviously the core concept, Lana!

15:58.776 --> 16:00.334
Sorry, I didn't go to Space Camp.

16:00.511 --> 16:01.944
How about bomb defusal camp?

16:02.113 --> 16:04.638
No, actually lacrosse camp. If that helps.

16:04.816 --> 16:06.841
I mean, a lot of those skills
are universal.

16:07.018 --> 16:09.748
- Shut up. Agent Gillette, please.
- Oh, great.

16:10.288 --> 16:12.518
Come on people, talk to me!

16:12.690 --> 16:14.783
What are we thinking? What are we doing?

16:14.959 --> 16:18.224
- What are we wearing?
- My crisis vest. Mr. Fatface.

16:18.396 --> 16:21.456
<i>- Lana? Hey, girl, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm... Hey, can you see me?</i>

16:21.632 --> 16:25.261
<i>- I see your knockoff Fiacci drawers.
- Ha-ha. You are such a bitch.</i>

16:25.436 --> 16:26.801
<i>- Hey, Ray.
- Ugh.</i>

16:26.971 --> 16:29.030
<i>- Let's see that ignition, girl.
You got it?</i>

16:29.207 --> 16:32.643
East German crap,
probably a GK-31 or 32.

16:32.810 --> 16:36.041
So on the side of the timer,
there should be a serial number.

16:36.214 --> 16:38.273
That'll tell me which wire
y'all need to cut.

16:38.449 --> 16:40.212
<i>Got it?
- Yeah, I see it! Ready?</i>

16:40.385 --> 16:43.718
<i>- Since first call.
- Nine, three, four...</i>

16:44.188 --> 16:47.885
<i>...T, X, S.
- T-X-X? Two X's?</i>

16:48.059 --> 16:49.993
<i>X- S! Like INXS!</i>

16:50.161 --> 16:53.562
N-X-X? Jesus, use
the NATO phonetic alphabet!

16:53.731 --> 16:56.029
<i>- The what? Duh.
Christ on sale, is it S?</i>

16:56.200 --> 16:57.895
Sierra! Ray...

16:58.069 --> 17:01.630
it's niner three four,
Tango, X-ray, Sierra!

17:01.806 --> 17:05.401
Thank you, doll! Now there should
be a dash, followed by two letters.

17:05.576 --> 17:07.874
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, so now I want you to cut...</i>

17:08.045 --> 17:10.309
the blue and white wire.

17:10.481 --> 17:12.472
<i>- Which one? There's two of those.
- No...</i>

17:12.650 --> 17:14.140
One's blue with a white stripe...

17:14.318 --> 17:16.377
<i>... and the other's white
with a blue stripe.</i>

17:16.554 --> 17:19.045
<i>- Yeah, and both are identical!
- No! They're not!</i>

17:19.223 --> 17:22.317
Ray? Hon? They're really similar.

17:22.492 --> 17:24.654
<i>One's a teeny bit... Blue, honey.</i>

17:24.829 --> 17:26.955
- Which one?
- I guess that one, maybe?

17:27.131 --> 17:30.430
<i>- So wait, which one do I cut?
- The teeny bit... Blue one!</i>

17:30.601 --> 17:31.932
<i>Okay!
- O-K?</i>

17:32.103 --> 17:33.297
<i>- Wait! Stop!
- What?</i>

17:33.471 --> 17:35.871
You said the letters
after the dash were Oscar Kilo!

17:36.040 --> 17:37.064
<i>- Who?
- What?</i>

17:37.241 --> 17:40.733
<i>- O-K! Oscar Kilo!
- No, "Okay!" Like:</i>

17:40.912 --> 17:43.073
"Okay, now I'm gonna
tell you what they are!"

17:43.247 --> 17:45.511
<i>- Then you didn't!
- I thought we skipped that part!</i>

17:45.683 --> 17:48.243
<i>- Skipped a step in disarming a bomb?
- Which I thought...</i>

17:48.419 --> 17:50.319
was pretty irresponsible on your part.

17:50.488 --> 17:52.615
- Why do you always do this?
- Why do you always not shut up?

17:53.991 --> 17:55.925
- Stop.
- On the radio...

17:56.093 --> 17:58.186
when we answer
in the affirmative...

17:58.362 --> 18:00.387
we say, "Roger."

18:00.565 --> 18:03.534
<i>- Roger. Sorry. Ray.
- Now. In the serial number...</i>

18:03.701 --> 18:06.568
what are the two letters
following the dash?

18:10.842 --> 18:12.469
<i>- You ready?
God damn it, Archer!</i>

18:12.643 --> 18:14.270
<i>- First letter is B.
- Bravo.</i>

18:14.445 --> 18:15.912
<i>Thanks, second letter is N.</i>

18:16.080 --> 18:17.308
M as in Mike, or N as...

18:17.482 --> 18:19.746
<i>- As in Nancy! God, you of all people.
- What?</i>

18:19.917 --> 18:21.248
<i>Archer!
- Me of all people?</i>

18:21.419 --> 18:23.284
<i>- Nothing.
- Ray, hon.</i>

18:23.454 --> 18:25.046
<i>- Okay.
- Oh, so you can say okay?</i>

18:25.223 --> 18:26.815
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Ray, can I shoot him?</i>

18:26.991 --> 18:28.151
In about five seconds, honey.

18:29.527 --> 18:31.324
<i>Lana, be careful! Jesus, the helium!</i>

18:31.496 --> 18:34.021
Right after he cuts the solid green wire.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.462
<i>- The green color is solid, or?
Roger.</i>

18:36.634 --> 18:39.728
Oh. Roger. Cutting the green wire.

18:40.438 --> 18:42.929
<i>Archer!
- Jesus, God! What?</i>

18:43.541 --> 18:44.838
<i>That's how annoying you are.</i>

18:45.009 --> 18:47.842
<i>- Your mom's annoying! How about that?
- Let's go there.</i>

18:48.012 --> 18:49.502
Let's go here! Where Archer...

18:49.680 --> 18:51.671
shut up and cut
the goddamn wire already!

18:51.849 --> 18:53.840
You shut up and I'm doing it! God!

18:54.018 --> 18:56.282
<i>- Oh, my... Ray!
What's going on?</i>

18:56.454 --> 18:58.854
<i>- The timer sped up!
- Did you cut the green one?</i>

18:59.023 --> 19:01.685
<i>- Yes! Roger! Steven! Whoever!
- Ray!</i>

19:01.859 --> 19:04.191
<i>- What were the last two letters?
B.</i>

19:04.362 --> 19:06.227
<i>- As in butt hole.
- What do we do here?</i>

19:06.397 --> 19:08.456
<i>And M! As in Mancy!</i>

19:08.633 --> 19:09.861
What?

19:11.669 --> 19:15.366
- M as in what?
- Mancy! What'd you think I said?

19:15.540 --> 19:17.371
<i>- Nancy! You idiot!
Oh, yeah!</i>

19:17.542 --> 19:20.409
<i>I can see how...
Then I was like "You of all..."</i>

19:23.814 --> 19:25.509
- Exact! Same! Spot!
- Ray?

19:25.683 --> 19:26.945
Ray? Tell me what to do!

19:27.118 --> 19:29.848
<i>So do you all have parachutes?</i>

19:30.021 --> 19:33.013
<i>No!
- That would be, you know, problem solved.</i>

19:33.190 --> 19:34.851
<i>- Ray!
- I don't know.</i>

19:35.026 --> 19:36.891
<i>Push it off with your big-ass hands.</i>

19:38.429 --> 19:40.829
<i>Good luck, honey.
- It's too heavy!</i>

19:40.998 --> 19:43.558
- Archer?
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

19:43.834 --> 19:47.326
- I can not do this alone!
- You're not alone!

19:47.505 --> 19:49.803
Baby! You came back to me!

19:49.974 --> 19:53.410
Well, I really... Lana, there's
a lot you and I need to talk about.

19:53.578 --> 19:55.512
And let's do that.
Right after we shove...

19:55.680 --> 19:59.013
this huge bomb off the blimp!
- Okay, but then we seriously need to...

19:59.183 --> 20:01.276
- Cyril!
- Sorry, here we go.

20:03.688 --> 20:07.021
Lana! We're not gonna make it!
- Yes, we are, Cyril!

20:07.191 --> 20:09.352
We are gonna make it.

20:10.962 --> 20:13.829
- Ha. Oh, my God! Lana, we made it!
- Oh.

20:13.998 --> 20:16.159
Hooray for metaphors.

20:16.334 --> 20:18.529
I told you. Ha-ha.

20:18.703 --> 20:20.603
Okay, now then.

20:20.771 --> 20:22.671
- What did you want to talk about?
- Um...

20:22.840 --> 20:25.502
Well, uh, a lot of stuff, really.

20:27.078 --> 20:29.205
Starting with the fact
we just bombed Ireland.

20:29.647 --> 20:32.343
Um... Pretty sure that's Wales.
