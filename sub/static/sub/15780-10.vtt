00:08.290 --> 00:11.851
Well, if it isn't the late
Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

00:11.894 --> 00:13.589
I'm glad you're still...

00:13.629 --> 00:15.062
hanging around.

00:15.097 --> 00:16.860
I wanted to thank you for finding...

00:16.899 --> 00:19.629
Grover Cleveland's
presidential time machine for me.

00:19.668 --> 00:21.135
I'll give him your regards.

00:21.169 --> 00:22.431
Take your time, Monarch.

00:22.471 --> 00:26.430
'Cause the minute you finish
your little speech, I'm gonna kill you.

00:26.475 --> 00:28.443
What are you, Obi-Wan Kenobi?

00:28.477 --> 00:29.774
Just look at you schmucks!

00:29.811 --> 00:32.177
I don't think I'm the one in danger here.

00:32.214 --> 00:35.672
Considering the sad fact
that right below you...

00:35.717 --> 00:38.185
flows the mighty Amazon...

00:38.220 --> 00:41.246
teeming with the most
gruesome fish to ever...

00:41.290 --> 00:42.484
- The piranha!
- No!

00:42.524 --> 00:43.548
- The shark?
- No!

00:43.592 --> 00:45.526
- The piranha?
- No!

00:45.561 --> 00:47.222
And shut up.
This isn't a quiz.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.388
Now, where was I? Right.

00:49.665 --> 00:52.691
The dreaded candiru,
a naughty little fish...

00:52.734 --> 00:55.760
with a penchant for
swimming up a man's urethra...

00:55.804 --> 00:59.365
to feed on the damaged tissue
of the pitiful mass of flesh...

00:59.408 --> 01:00.898
you once called your penis!

01:00.943 --> 01:03.503
That is a total myth!
There is no such fish.

01:03.545 --> 01:04.977
- Is too!
- No, there isn't!

01:05.013 --> 01:06.037
- Time-out!
- What?

01:06.081 --> 01:07.070
Time-out!

01:07.115 --> 01:08.241
I'm really hurt!

01:08.283 --> 01:10.581
This isn't freeze tag.
You can't do that!

01:10.619 --> 01:12.917
I'm serious.
I really feel sick!

01:12.955 --> 01:15.116
Don't even think about ralphing on me.

01:15.157 --> 01:16.488
Where are you hurt, boy?

01:16.525 --> 01:17.583
I don't want to say.

01:17.626 --> 01:19.025
- Oh, great.
- Dean?

01:19.061 --> 01:21.256
My no-nos hurt.

01:21.296 --> 01:22.490
What the hell are no-nos?

01:22.531 --> 01:24.897
That's the super adult term
my teenage sons use...

01:24.933 --> 01:26.924
to refer to their genitals...

01:26.969 --> 01:28.163
in public...

01:28.203 --> 01:29.670
in front of their father.

01:29.705 --> 01:32.833
Well, duh! You all should be feeling
the sting in your nethers...

01:32.874 --> 01:36.970
for in seconds, the dreaded candiru
will seek out the tiny...

01:38.213 --> 01:39.874
The kid's really hurt. Let him go.

01:39.915 --> 01:41.007
Why?

01:41.049 --> 01:42.516
I'm about to kill all of you anyway.

01:42.551 --> 01:43.848
What's the point, really?

01:43.885 --> 01:45.045
Because you have to!

01:45.087 --> 01:49.353
In 1969, the Guild of Calamitous Intent
enacted an addendum to article 47...

01:49.391 --> 01:50.688
of the Unusual Torture Act.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.023
So let's cut the monkey business.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.028
- Go, Dad!
- Yes, go, Dad.

01:54.062 --> 01:56.030
And what's more,
you arrogant little trouble-maker...

01:56.064 --> 01:57.588
you have to let us all go.

01:57.633 --> 01:58.793
How the hell do you know that?

01:58.834 --> 02:00.495
Check it out for yourself.

02:00.535 --> 02:01.763
Maybe I will.

02:01.803 --> 02:04.135
You don't know when to stop
with all this, do you?

02:04.172 --> 02:05.639
You just keep pushing my buttons!

02:05.674 --> 02:06.971
You're my arch enemy!

02:07.009 --> 02:08.499
That's what I do!
That's my thing!

02:09.544 --> 02:10.636
All right, fine.

02:10.679 --> 02:12.704
I have a Guild of
Calamitous Intent handbook...

02:12.748 --> 02:13.976
in my glove compartment.

02:14.016 --> 02:15.643
I'll be right back.

02:15.684 --> 02:17.311
Don't go anywhere.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.437 --> 03:10.462
Well, I think that's settled then.

03:10.505 --> 03:12.803
We meet back here in two days.

03:12.841 --> 03:14.240
I keep the big one as collateral.

03:15.677 --> 03:17.736
But what if Dean dies before then?

03:17.779 --> 03:19.076
Then I kill this guy.

03:19.114 --> 03:22.481
The Guild of Calamitous Intent...
which, incidentally, I only joined...

03:22.517 --> 03:24.485
to get the full-dental
and partial health package...

03:24.519 --> 03:27.317
has this pretty cut and dry.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.084
I have to kill him.
Those are my orders.

03:29.124 --> 03:30.421
I'm not even going with you.

03:30.459 --> 03:31.653
What do you mean
you're not going with me?

03:31.693 --> 03:32.990
I'm a bodyguard.

03:33.028 --> 03:34.723
You have your orders, and I got mine.

03:34.763 --> 03:37.459
OK, then, guard him!

03:40.902 --> 03:41.960
No way!

03:42.003 --> 03:43.937
The addendum to
the Unusual Torture Act...

03:43.972 --> 03:46.463
is also called Rusty's law.

03:46.508 --> 03:48.271
They used to call my dad Rusty.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.335
How do you think your father
knew everything about it?

03:50.378 --> 03:52.539
Because he's a genius super scientist.

03:52.581 --> 03:54.105
I like to dream, too, Hank.

03:54.149 --> 03:57.607
But face it, your grandfather
really did a number on your old man.

03:57.652 --> 03:58.846
God, what a pro!

03:58.887 --> 04:01.378
I wish I was old enough
to hate him when he was alive!

04:01.423 --> 04:02.890
Now, that was an arch enemy!

04:02.924 --> 04:04.619
I never met my grandfather.

04:04.659 --> 04:05.956
I never even met my Mom.

04:05.994 --> 04:10.454
Hank, what would you say
if I told you that your mother...

04:10.499 --> 04:13.093
- was someone you've met before?
- What?

04:13.135 --> 04:16.798
And what if I told you that your father
is not your real father?

04:16.838 --> 04:18.327
Hank!

04:18.373 --> 04:19.772
Hank!

04:19.808 --> 04:21.901
I am your real father!

04:21.942 --> 04:24.639
No way. No way!
That's not true!

04:24.679 --> 04:26.977
Psyche! Ha, sucker!

04:27.015 --> 04:29.142
You were all, "Oh, Daddy,
you're my Daddy!"

04:29.184 --> 04:31.379
You are so gullible.
What is that like?

04:33.155 --> 04:34.349
Hey, can I have your pudding?

04:34.389 --> 04:36.914
Um, no. I'm so saving that.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.654
You really have to hold that
so close to my face?

04:39.694 --> 04:41.252
I mean, where am I gonna go?

04:41.296 --> 04:42.991
Yeah, dude, ease up on him.

04:43.031 --> 04:44.999
It's not like that's loaded or anything.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.263
Aw, what are you?
Some sort of an imbecile?

04:47.302 --> 04:48.894
Why would you even do that?

04:48.937 --> 04:50.234
Did you lift anything heavy?

04:50.272 --> 04:52.570
I told you, it's not a hernia!

04:52.607 --> 04:53.835
Were you rough-housing
with your brother?

04:53.875 --> 04:54.899
No.

04:54.943 --> 04:56.001
Oh, dear God.

04:56.044 --> 04:59.480
You two haven't been experimenting
with inappropriate touching?

04:59.514 --> 05:00.708
No! Gross!

05:00.749 --> 05:04.048
I know you've been seeing a lot
of that little tramp who lives next door.

05:04.085 --> 05:06.883
Lord knows what kinds of
diseases that hussy carries.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.549
It's getting worse!

05:08.590 --> 05:11.787
Dean, I don't want you hanging around
with Triana Orpheus anymore.

05:11.827 --> 05:13.886
I don't approve of the way she dresses.

05:13.929 --> 05:15.453
Girls like that are usually on the dope.

05:16.765 --> 05:19.734
Dean, have you been
shooting dope into your scrotum?

05:19.768 --> 05:22.066
You can tell me! I'm hip!

05:22.103 --> 05:24.867
Dad, why are you doing this?

05:24.906 --> 05:27.306
I don't know what I did!

05:27.342 --> 05:30.140
Suddenly it just felt like someone
kicked me in the rocks...

05:30.178 --> 05:32.976
and they never took their foot away!

05:33.014 --> 05:35.949
All right, Dean, you're gonna
have to pull down your pants.

05:35.984 --> 05:37.474
I have to palpate the region.

05:37.519 --> 05:40.317
Please, Dad, please, please,
please don't feel me up!

05:40.355 --> 05:42.323
I'm going to palpate, Dean.

05:42.357 --> 05:44.154
This isn't any fun for me, either.

05:44.192 --> 05:45.659
Do you want me to get H.E.L.P.eR. To do it?

05:45.694 --> 05:46.991
Is that better for you?

05:47.028 --> 05:49.258
A doddering old robot
with cold, steel claws.

05:49.297 --> 05:50.559
Is that what you want?

05:51.867 --> 05:53.732
I want a doctor!

05:56.104 --> 05:57.298
Are you gonna get the phone or what?

05:57.339 --> 05:58.328
What is wrong with you?

05:58.373 --> 05:59.670
Why don't you ever flush?

05:59.708 --> 06:01.767
It's like a bucket full
of payday bars in there.

06:01.810 --> 06:04.335
Come on, fella,
you're blocking the screen!

06:04.379 --> 06:06.313
Is it so hard to pull a handle?

06:06.348 --> 06:08.680
Oh, now, where could
I have heard this before?

06:08.717 --> 06:10.116
Could it be I read it, like...

06:10.151 --> 06:12.949
about a thousand times
in those passive/aggressive Post-its...

06:12.988 --> 06:14.319
you put all over the camper?

06:14.356 --> 06:15.721
Those aren't passive/aggressive.

06:15.757 --> 06:16.781
They're informative.

06:16.825 --> 06:18.554
Are you going to get the phone or not?

06:18.593 --> 06:19.617
Can't.

06:19.661 --> 06:22.892
I'm apparently doing a drive-by mission
for the yardies over here.

06:24.266 --> 06:25.460
Conjectural Technologies.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.593
Master Billy, boy genius, speaking.

06:27.636 --> 06:29.126
Billy, you gotta do it.

06:30.672 --> 06:32.731
How can we make your tomorrow better?

06:32.774 --> 06:34.139
Well, l...

06:34.175 --> 06:35.642
I guess it's theoretically possible.

06:35.677 --> 06:36.803
Billy, if you push the start button...

06:36.845 --> 06:38.312
- you can see my stats!
- Yeah, uh-huh. Sure.

06:38.346 --> 06:40.041
I am awesome!

06:40.081 --> 06:41.139
OK, sure.

06:41.182 --> 06:42.945
But then there is my rather steep fee.

06:42.984 --> 06:45.817
OK, then. All right.

06:45.854 --> 06:47.446
Bye-bye.

06:47.489 --> 06:48.922
"Bye-bye"?

06:48.957 --> 06:50.822
Well, he said it first.
It just slipped out.

06:50.859 --> 06:52.656
Well? Do we have a job?

06:52.694 --> 06:53.752
Brace yourself.

06:53.795 --> 06:55.057
That was Dr. Venture.

06:55.096 --> 06:56.085
Get out!

06:56.131 --> 06:58.099
I will not.
And there's more.

06:58.133 --> 07:01.102
It seems that
his son has a mysterious malady...

07:01.136 --> 07:02.933
and he needs the help of...

07:02.971 --> 07:05.269
Conjectural Technologies.

07:05.307 --> 07:06.433
Way to go, Billy.

07:06.474 --> 07:09.932
Did you tell him that you needed
the aid of a certain computer technician?

07:09.978 --> 07:12.208
You're in.
Did you ask for some extra cash...

07:12.247 --> 07:13.680
to refuel the helicopter?

07:13.715 --> 07:14.841
We don't have a helicopter.

07:14.883 --> 07:16.180
Venture doesn't know that.

07:16.217 --> 07:17.445
High five!

07:17.485 --> 07:18.952
I don't think so.

07:18.987 --> 07:21.080
Man, this is the coolest book ever.

07:21.122 --> 07:23.283
There's a guy in here
who guards his headquarters...

07:23.325 --> 07:24.815
with robot cheetahs!

07:24.859 --> 07:26.121
Oh, yeah.
The Zoocreeper.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.753
Oh, hey, am I in there?

07:27.796 --> 07:29.627
Uh... nope.

07:29.664 --> 07:31.757
"M" for Monarch.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.791
Try "T" for "The Monarch!"

07:33.835 --> 07:36.998
Nothing.
So where are we going?

07:37.038 --> 07:38.335
Towards the blinking light.

07:38.373 --> 07:40.136
We fly by radar alone.

07:40.175 --> 07:43.372
The location of my flying cocoon
is highly secretive.

07:43.411 --> 07:45.504
Even I don't know its whereabouts.

07:45.547 --> 07:47.811
It may well be floating over the moon!

07:47.849 --> 07:49.316
- Really?
- Maybe.

07:49.351 --> 07:52.411
Or even deep below the earth's crust.

07:52.454 --> 07:53.819
Hey! It's the Grand Canyon.

07:53.855 --> 07:57.313
Or it might be in the Grand Canyon,
hovering where everyone can see it.

07:57.359 --> 07:58.826
Sure. Yeah.
Wouldn't rule that out.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.020
Plausible.

08:04.065 --> 08:05.293
Surprise!

08:05.333 --> 08:06.425
Crap! An ambush!

08:09.704 --> 08:13.265
My bad. Sorry, everybody.
Sorry. My bad.

08:13.308 --> 08:16.106
Now, before you tell me what
a jolly good fellow I am...

08:16.144 --> 08:18.510
there are some people who
I would like you to meet.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.710
Someone got him Brock Samson?

08:23.752 --> 08:24.946
Now I feel like a tool.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.112
What'd you get him?

08:26.154 --> 08:28.622
I made him coupons for one free washing
of the Monarch-mobile...

08:28.656 --> 08:29.645
and one free back rub.

08:29.691 --> 08:31.090
Aren't those your jobs anyway?

08:31.126 --> 08:33.356
Yeah, but these are coupons.

08:33.395 --> 08:34.623
All right, now...

08:34.662 --> 08:36.892
let's see what all this fuss is about.

08:36.931 --> 08:40.457
Dean, you wanted a doctor,
and Billy is one of the best.

08:40.501 --> 08:42.129
Now drop those pants, mister.

08:42.169 --> 08:44.138
Actually, this is more of a job
for a urologist.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.640
Billy is more of a neurogeneticist.

08:46.674 --> 08:49.074
Yeah, but this kind of thing
should be a walk in the park.

08:49.110 --> 08:50.975
A walk through a park
with genitals for trees.

08:51.012 --> 08:52.377
And hair for grass.

08:52.414 --> 08:53.904
Oh, I'm sure that put him at ease.

08:53.948 --> 08:56.473
You two might want to work
on your bedside manner.

08:56.518 --> 08:58.486
Dr. Girlfriend...

08:58.520 --> 09:02.854
I'm coming in with some cake,
and a little surprise for you.

09:02.891 --> 09:04.984
Come in, sweetie!

09:05.026 --> 09:07.961
I have a little surprise for you, too.

09:07.996 --> 09:11.124
For he's a sexy good fellow

09:11.166 --> 09:12.428
Oh, sweet mercy!

09:12.467 --> 09:14.731
Dr. Girlfriend!

09:14.769 --> 09:17.431
Won't you come over here
with me for a moment?

09:17.472 --> 09:20.270
Oh, I guess
the muscular one is all right...

09:20.308 --> 09:22.469
but the boy is just going too far.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.444
Can't we just use the puppet again?

09:24.479 --> 09:25.776
No, no. Sweetie!

09:25.814 --> 09:27.611
This is Brock Samson and Hank Venture.

09:27.649 --> 09:29.082
I captured them.

09:29.117 --> 09:30.744
- Did not!
- Did too!

09:30.785 --> 09:33.777
I think you better give us
a place to bed down.

09:33.822 --> 09:36.723
Kid here gets kind of wiggy
if he doesn't get enough sleep.

09:36.758 --> 09:37.918
Of course.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.620
I treat my captives as kings.

09:39.661 --> 09:42.289
You'll be given
the grandest of accommodations.

09:42.330 --> 09:45.458
It will be a far cry from sleeping
over Dr. Venture's garage...

09:45.500 --> 09:47.092
like so much Fonzie.

09:47.135 --> 09:50.502
Hey, you put me in a stinky old jail cell
last time I was here.

09:50.538 --> 09:52.563
You broke my heart, Hank.

09:52.607 --> 09:55.735
Come on, there, fella,
you could have a real problem.

09:55.777 --> 09:57.745
With your lifestyle, who knows?

09:57.779 --> 10:01.180
Could be an implant or a space virus...

10:02.183 --> 10:03.480
A parasite.

10:03.518 --> 10:06.487
Sure. Parasite,
growing larger by the minute.

10:06.521 --> 10:09.319
It probably wants to eat your brain.

10:09.357 --> 10:12.417
OK, OK! But I don't want you to look.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.429
Fine. I'll go behind the screen.

10:15.463 --> 10:18.261
All right.

10:18.299 --> 10:19.425
Let's see 'em.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.435
I don't want to show my junk
to a little boy.

10:21.469 --> 10:22.595
Oh, come on!

10:22.637 --> 10:23.661
You said you wouldn't look!

10:23.705 --> 10:25.172
I'm not looking!

10:25.206 --> 10:26.935
Billy, 'fess up to the boy.

10:26.975 --> 10:28.499
He's been pulling that boy genius crap...

10:28.543 --> 10:30.511
for at least the twenty years
that I've known him.

10:30.545 --> 10:32.172
Well, nobody's really that impressed...

10:32.213 --> 10:34.773
with Master Billy Quizboy, adult genius.

10:34.816 --> 10:37.341
Like a speech impediment
and growth hormone deficiency...

10:37.385 --> 10:39.353
qualifies you as a boy genius.

10:39.387 --> 10:40.684
Don't forget the huge head.

10:40.722 --> 10:41.746
I copped to it.

10:41.789 --> 10:43.620
Now you guys are just
ganging up on me.

10:43.658 --> 10:46.627
Could we just do this, please?

10:48.329 --> 10:50.763
Holy mackerel!

10:50.798 --> 10:54.097
I am not prepared to rule out
the parasite hypothesis.

10:56.771 --> 10:59.934
The boss is wicked excited
that you're here to celebrate his birthday.

10:59.974 --> 11:01.942
What'd you guys get him?

11:01.976 --> 11:03.307
Well, I have a Razzle in my pocket.

11:03.344 --> 11:04.470
I could give him that.

11:04.512 --> 11:05.809
First it's a candy, then it's a gum.

11:05.846 --> 11:07.541
So that's like two gifts.

11:07.581 --> 11:09.981
You have no idea
why we're here, do you?

11:10.017 --> 11:12.315
Big birthday bash, what else?

11:12.353 --> 11:13.945
Yeah. That's it.

11:13.988 --> 11:17.981
Well, it doesn't look like
the Monarch needs anything.

11:18.025 --> 11:21.825
He's got a flying cocoon...

11:21.862 --> 11:26.663
sharp henchmen
in peak physical condition.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.327
He's got it all.

11:30.805 --> 11:31.999
Morning, sleepyheads.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.507
Heh, wish I had your life,
sleeping all day.

11:34.542 --> 11:37.409
So, I trust you found
the lodging provided to be agreeable?

11:37.445 --> 11:39.037
I had to sleep in my clothes.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.207
Now I feel gross wearing
them two days in a row.

11:41.248 --> 11:42.681
You're kidding me, right?

11:42.716 --> 11:44.809
That's the only outfit
I've ever seen you in.

11:44.852 --> 11:46.479
Well, it doesn't mean I never wash it.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.181
Fair enough.
Number Twenty-Seven!

11:48.222 --> 11:50.690
Get the kid a change of clothes.

11:50.724 --> 11:51.884
How about you?
You OK?

11:51.926 --> 11:53.951
I didn't sleep in my clothes.

11:53.994 --> 11:56.121
Twenty-Seven!

11:56.163 --> 11:58.290
Burn his sheets!

11:58.332 --> 12:02.860
Gentlemen, welcome to the heart
of the Monarch's lair...

12:02.903 --> 12:06.134
the living nerve center
of my ominous body.

12:06.173 --> 12:08.869
This is where it all happens.

12:08.909 --> 12:10.877
Relax...

12:10.911 --> 12:13.505
and enjoy the show.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.268
Are you going past the fridge?

12:35.302 --> 12:36.667
Can you get me a Fresca?

12:38.439 --> 12:39.997
Well, what do we usually do?

12:40.040 --> 12:41.439
You make some "I'm gonna
get Dr. Venture" speech...

12:41.475 --> 12:42.567
and then, you know.

12:42.610 --> 12:44.635
Well, we can't do that.

12:44.678 --> 12:46.839
Man, this is sad.

12:46.881 --> 12:49.042
Crap, you scared me!

12:49.083 --> 12:51.847
Don't you have nothing else to do
but harp on Dr. Venture?

12:51.886 --> 12:54.446
Why haven't you tried
the world domination thing?

12:54.488 --> 12:56.115
You afraid of the big leagues?

12:56.157 --> 12:58.523
Please, how stupid do I look to you?

12:58.559 --> 13:00.220
World domination.

13:00.261 --> 13:03.287
I'll leave that to the religious nuts
and the Republicans, thank you.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.457
But I wouldn't be so quick to judge.

13:05.499 --> 13:09.230
The Monarch has his hands
in many sinister soups.

13:09.270 --> 13:11.431
It's just an off day.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.771
I thought my birthdays were lame.

13:16.277 --> 13:19.269
Well, the good news is
you don't have a parasite.

13:19.313 --> 13:21.144
The bad news is that
you have a condition...

13:21.182 --> 13:24.174
known as acute testicular torsion.

13:24.218 --> 13:27.779
- What does that mean?
- Well, in a nutshell... no pun intended...

13:27.821 --> 13:29.311
your balls pulled a one-eighty.

13:29.356 --> 13:30.823
In a way, you're kind of lucky.

13:30.858 --> 13:32.655
It only happens to one in four thousand.

13:32.693 --> 13:34.923
It's like you won the genetic freak lottery.

13:34.962 --> 13:36.190
I blame myself.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.663
Oh, there's nothing you could have done.

13:37.698 --> 13:39.757
I could have fixed this
in the prototype phase.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.495
Don't be so hard on yourself.

13:41.535 --> 13:46.097
Raising a son is an experiment
no scientist is prepared for.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.835
That's beautiful, Billy.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.604
Thanks. I just came up with that.

13:49.643 --> 13:54.103
Come on! They have one female
servicing a large group of males.

13:54.148 --> 13:56.514
That implies a species that lays eggs.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.450
Oh, my God, you're crazy.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.248
They are so obviously mammals!

14:00.287 --> 14:03.745
Please! She'd be in estrus
24/7 if she didn't lay eggs.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.986
Smurfs don't lay eggs!

14:06.026 --> 14:07.618
I won't tell you this again.

14:07.661 --> 14:09.629
Papa Smurf has
a [bleep]-ing beard.

14:09.663 --> 14:11.392
They're mammals!

14:13.300 --> 14:15.063
Well, what happens now?

14:15.102 --> 14:16.933
We have a couple of options here.

14:16.971 --> 14:18.802
We can do nothing.
It'll probably keep swelling...

14:18.839 --> 14:19.965
and let me tell you...

14:20.007 --> 14:21.474
that beach ball
you're packing down there...

14:21.508 --> 14:22.634
can't afford that.

14:22.676 --> 14:24.974
Or I could perform orchiopexy.

14:25.012 --> 14:26.912
That means he wants
to operate on you...

14:26.947 --> 14:28.574
and you know, tie it down.

14:28.616 --> 14:30.811
No way! He's not gonna operate on me!

14:30.851 --> 14:33.251
Dad, can't you fix this!
Aren't you a doctor?

14:33.287 --> 14:35.084
Make it go away! Please!

14:35.122 --> 14:36.749
Take it easy, Dean.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.655
Well, what happens if we wait?

14:38.692 --> 14:40.159
That's not so good.

14:40.194 --> 14:41.821
My guess is that in a couple of hours...

14:41.862 --> 14:45.821
your son's testes
are going to die, then atrophy.

14:45.866 --> 14:47.493
Think raisins. Or better yet...

14:47.534 --> 14:48.831
you know when you're eating peanuts...

14:48.869 --> 14:51.838
and you crack one open
and the little nut is all dark...

14:51.872 --> 14:53.169
and crammed into one corner...

14:53.207 --> 14:54.606
You're finished, right?

14:54.642 --> 14:58.203
As for untwisting them,
I don't know which way they spun.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.112
Unless you're that guy from INX S
and that's, like, your thing...

15:01.148 --> 15:03.082
the pain would be excruciating.

15:03.117 --> 15:05.142
All right!
Let's just get this over with.

15:05.185 --> 15:07.949
Nurse, prep the patient
and shave the region.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.548
Nurse? You said
I was your technician.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.250
Do you have to shave it?

15:15.729 --> 15:17.060
I just grew those.

15:21.502 --> 15:23.299
Distress call from cellblock "C."

15:23.337 --> 15:26.135
Excellent!
Put it up on the big screen!

15:26.173 --> 15:28.869
I want the captives to see it.

15:28.909 --> 15:30.308
Where's the big guy?
He's gonna miss this.

15:30.344 --> 15:31.868
Boss, there's a monster down here!

15:31.912 --> 15:35.404
I think it was two ninjas taped together
to make one giant ninja.

15:35.449 --> 15:36.973
I saw it climb the wall.

15:37.017 --> 15:38.279
It was a giant spider!

15:38.319 --> 15:40.310
See? Now we're talking here, huh?

15:40.354 --> 15:42.584
Giant spider in the cocoon.
Where's Samson?

15:42.623 --> 15:44.784
I can't believe he's not here to see this.

15:44.825 --> 15:46.588
All right, what happened?
And one at a time.

15:46.627 --> 15:48.151
We're standing here talking, right?

15:48.195 --> 15:51.130
Then suddenly something
cuts number Forty-Three's tendon.

15:51.165 --> 15:52.154
It was horrible.

15:52.199 --> 15:55.657
Oh, his calf muscle rolled up
like a window shade!

15:55.703 --> 15:58.934
He just kept screaming till he passed out.

15:58.972 --> 16:01.270
Party's over, Monarch.

16:01.308 --> 16:04.368
It's time I shut down
this little tree fort of yours.

16:04.411 --> 16:05.605
Brock Samson.

16:05.646 --> 16:07.546
I had a hunch you were behind this.

16:07.581 --> 16:10.209
Your arrogance will be your undoing.

16:10.250 --> 16:13.048
I will get you, Brock Samson!

16:13.087 --> 16:15.612
Numbers Eighteen, Thirty-Eight,
Forty, and Thirty-One...

16:15.656 --> 16:17.123
Secure the prison level.

16:17.157 --> 16:19.625
Engineering, I want
a steady stream of cyanide...

16:19.660 --> 16:22.185
pumped into the vents
of section one through four.

16:22.229 --> 16:23.753
Move!

16:23.797 --> 16:25.264
Oh, and Brock?

16:25.299 --> 16:27.324
- What?
- Thank you.

16:28.369 --> 16:30.360
No, please, no! No!

16:46.019 --> 16:48.579
Release the butterflies!

16:50.858 --> 16:51.916
OK.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.325
Whose job was it
to feed the butterflies?

17:02.102 --> 17:04.536
Way to go, Billy.
Nice job.

17:04.570 --> 17:07.267
And that knot you tied,
what is that, a sheep shank?

17:07.307 --> 17:08.433
Yeah, it's my signature.

17:08.474 --> 17:10.102
It sure makes a statement.

17:10.144 --> 17:11.441
High five.

17:11.478 --> 17:13.638
Come on, would you
stop with that? Really.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.877
Brock is totally wailing on you guys.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.817
The screen says you just lost another unit.

17:18.852 --> 17:21.980
Nonsense!
He's in my world now.

17:22.021 --> 17:25.617
The cocoon's internal defense system
was designed by a genius...

17:25.659 --> 17:26.819
me!

17:26.859 --> 17:29.658
We're merely toying with him,
drawing him out.

17:29.696 --> 17:32.460
Let him take as many pawns as he needs!

17:32.499 --> 17:33.659
Hey!

17:33.700 --> 17:35.463
- Hey what?
- Can I try that on?

17:35.502 --> 17:37.231
It's all pinned to the cowl.

17:37.271 --> 17:39.398
Kind of a pain in the ass to get back on.

17:41.842 --> 17:43.901
You scream, I'll break your neck.

17:43.944 --> 17:45.309
You understand me?

17:46.680 --> 17:49.274
You're going to take advantage
of me, aren't you?

17:49.316 --> 17:51.546
Well, be quick with it.

17:51.585 --> 17:54.713
To be honest with you,
I never really considered that.

17:54.755 --> 17:55.779
Why not?

17:55.823 --> 17:56.812
Just didn't.

17:56.857 --> 17:58.256
Well, I'm not gonna beg.

18:02.062 --> 18:03.154
What happened to my underwear?

18:03.197 --> 18:06.064
You can't wear underpants
until we remove the dressing, sweetie.

18:06.099 --> 18:07.259
What's going on?

18:07.301 --> 18:08.734
What are all those people doing here?

18:08.769 --> 18:10.236
I thought you might
need some cheering up!

18:12.172 --> 18:18.634
I've brought you a Zuni fetish doll
for being such a brave little trooper.

18:18.679 --> 18:21.307
I do hope you don't
already have one.

18:21.348 --> 18:24.181
You're good as new,
maybe even better.

18:24.218 --> 18:26.152
I hooked you up with
the complete package...

18:26.186 --> 18:27.448
if you know what I mean.

18:27.488 --> 18:28.580
I don't.

18:30.424 --> 18:34.224
A warm freezer pop.
How thoughtful.

18:34.261 --> 18:35.785
I saved these for you.

18:35.829 --> 18:38.957
I was gonna tape them
in a scrapbook, but here.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.728
They're your pubic hairs.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.735
Thanks... I guess.

18:42.769 --> 18:44.464
Hey, Triana.

18:44.505 --> 18:46.564
Kiss him.
That would be so cute.

18:46.607 --> 18:47.801
Aw, sweet.

18:47.841 --> 18:51.709
So tell me, is this the most
humiliating moment of your life, or what?

18:51.745 --> 18:53.212
Easily.

18:54.615 --> 18:57.550
Let the girlfriend go!
It's me you want.

18:57.584 --> 18:58.915
Give me the boy, Monarch.

18:58.952 --> 19:00.442
The boy's with me now.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.012
He has tasted the fruits
of supervillainy...

19:03.056 --> 19:04.523
and found them sweet.

19:04.558 --> 19:06.082
- No, I haven't.
- OK, fine!

19:06.126 --> 19:09.892
Give me the girl
or your precious Hank Venture dies!

19:09.930 --> 19:12.728
Monarch, we have transmission
from the Venture compound.

19:13.467 --> 19:15.458
It's your father!
Everybody scramble!

19:16.870 --> 19:18.360
Uh, act like nothing happened.

19:18.405 --> 19:20.396
Hold that transmission.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.102
Get these corpses out of here!

19:23.143 --> 19:24.440
- Hello. Come in, Monarch.
- Go, go, go!

19:24.478 --> 19:27.003
This is Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

19:27.047 --> 19:28.674
What is your status? Over.

19:28.715 --> 19:31.013
- And who may I say is calling?
- Down, down!

19:31.051 --> 19:32.279
You know damn well who I am.

19:32.319 --> 19:33.877
I just said this is
Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

19:33.921 --> 19:34.910
Now put the Monarch on.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.547
Yes! This is the Monarch.

19:36.590 --> 19:38.148
Everything is super great
and normal here.

19:38.191 --> 19:39.783
- What are you talking about?
- Has your son died yet?

19:39.826 --> 19:40.952
Or was he faking it?

19:40.994 --> 19:42.791
No, he had a legitimate
medical condition...

19:42.829 --> 19:43.955
and that's been solved.

19:43.997 --> 19:45.464
My testicles spun around.

19:45.499 --> 19:47.967
Hey, Hank. I had emergency surgery.

19:48.001 --> 19:49.628
Dean, Daddy's talking now.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.467
I'm ready to finish this
business with you now...

19:51.505 --> 19:54.633
so if we... what?
Is that blood all over you?

19:54.675 --> 19:55.972
What's going on over there?

19:56.009 --> 19:58.136
Oh, this?
This is... jelly.

19:58.178 --> 20:02.376
We were just enjoying a gift pack
of assorted jams and preserves.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.377
Yummy!

20:05.419 --> 20:06.716
Brock! Hank!

20:06.753 --> 20:08.448
Everything is fine, Doc.

20:08.488 --> 20:10.581
- We just had a little...
- Party!

20:10.624 --> 20:11.852
- We had a birthday party.
- Hey, Pop!

20:11.892 --> 20:14.190
- Is that true, Hank?
- I guess. Hey, Dean!

20:14.227 --> 20:16.161
Hank, I had my pubes shaved.

20:16.196 --> 20:18.357
I'm gonna put them
under my pillow for the tooth fairy!

20:18.398 --> 20:20.764
Did the doctor see
that creepy dog dork of yours?

20:20.801 --> 20:22.325
Hank, don't brag to your brother
about your circumcision.

20:22.369 --> 20:23.495
And what are you wearing?

20:23.537 --> 20:24.595
It's the Monarch's crown!

20:24.638 --> 20:25.662
We had a party.

20:25.706 --> 20:27.333
Look, this is ridiculous.

20:27.374 --> 20:29.239
I'm taking Dean
back to the Amazon...

20:29.276 --> 20:30.334
as per our arrangement.

20:30.377 --> 20:32.004
Over and out!

20:32.045 --> 20:34.513
Well, if it isn't the late
Dr. Thaddeus Venture...

20:34.548 --> 20:35.776
blah, blah, blah.

20:35.816 --> 20:37.113
Come on, get to the end part.

20:37.150 --> 20:38.378
I can't feel my hands.

20:38.418 --> 20:40.045
Very well, Dr. Venture.

20:40.087 --> 20:42.521
I, too, am anxious to see
you severely mangled...

20:42.556 --> 20:47.186
for below you swims the dreaded candiru,
a naughty little fish...

20:47.227 --> 20:49.627
with a penchant for
swimming up a man's urethra.

20:49.663 --> 20:51.028
Come on, just do it.

20:51.064 --> 20:53.123
Oh, you're real fun.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.531
Cut the rope!

20:54.568 --> 20:58.129
And let them feel the sting of the Monarch!

20:58.171 --> 20:59.536
Time-out!

21:27.200 --> 21:29.634
Go Team Venture!

21:33.640 --> 21:37.770
Testicular torsion
isn't just something on TV.

21:37.811 --> 21:39.608
It's a real problem.

21:39.646 --> 21:44.777
Testicular torsion occurs only in males
usually under twenty-five years of age.

21:44.818 --> 21:47.685
If you're experiencing
sharp pains in the scrotum...

21:47.721 --> 21:52.181
swelling in one or both testes,
or even blood in your semen...

21:52.225 --> 21:55.126
your genitals are most likely dying.

21:55.162 --> 21:56.652
That's right, Doc.

21:56.697 --> 22:01.464
So if you want to keep them,
you need to seek medical attention...

22:01.501 --> 22:07.269
as soon as you experience pain,
like Hank and Dean here did.

22:07.307 --> 22:09.138
So don't be a jackass.

22:09.176 --> 22:10.370
Go see a doctor.

22:10.410 --> 22:15.074
If you want to keep your testicles healthy,
remember these three words:

22:15.115 --> 22:17.208
Stop...

22:17.250 --> 22:18.239
Touch...

22:18.285 --> 22:19.547
And tell.

22:19.586 --> 22:24.421
To find out more about testicular torsion,
you can look in special medical books.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.982
Or on the interweb.
