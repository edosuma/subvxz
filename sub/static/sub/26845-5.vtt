00:03.969 --> 00:05.927
( theme music playing )

00:37.176 --> 00:39.343
( footsteps )

00:41.427 --> 00:42.969
( objects thud )

00:43.051 --> 00:44.969
( door unlocking )

02:37.385 --> 02:39.010
Woman:
Hi.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.427
Can-- Wait,
can you hear me now?

02:56.051 --> 02:58.176
Is-- Is this better?

03:01.176 --> 03:04.343
Hi, uh,
could you please keep

03:04.427 --> 03:06.010
your telephone
conversation down?

03:06.093 --> 03:08.218
It's not your fault,
I think the walls

03:08.301 --> 03:11.802
are just really thin.
Thank you.

03:13.677 --> 03:16.051
( woman laughing )

03:20.385 --> 03:24.010
Yeah, it's still
a little loud. Thank you.

03:28.218 --> 03:30.552
( laughs hysterically )

03:30.635 --> 03:32.593
I can't breathe!

03:32.677 --> 03:35.051
( laughter continues )

03:37.969 --> 03:39.760
This is ridiculous.

03:44.552 --> 03:48.260
Hello. Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you. I'm in Room 104,

03:48.343 --> 03:50.427
and the woman next door
is just--

03:50.510 --> 03:53.343
well, I don't know
if she's just very loud

03:53.427 --> 03:56.135
or if the walls are very thin,
but it's inconvenient,

03:56.218 --> 03:58.260
and I was wondering
if I could switch rooms,

03:58.343 --> 04:01.093
preferably with a vacancy
on either side.

04:03.927 --> 04:06.135
Well, that isn't possible,

04:06.218 --> 04:08.844
'cause I literally
just heard her.

04:11.260 --> 04:14.760
Well, perhaps someone
is crashing your motel,

04:14.844 --> 04:19.260
because I am telling you,
there is a woman in Room 106.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.844
- Sorry to disturb.
- It's OK.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.760
Let's just go see.

04:31.885 --> 04:33.385
( manager clears throat )

04:33.468 --> 04:35.051
( door opens )

04:35.135 --> 04:37.301
Manager:
Seems empty to me, yeah?

04:37.385 --> 04:40.927
Catherine:
I, uh-- Well, maybe she left.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.385
- Manager: I don't know, honey.
- ( door shuts )

04:43.468 --> 04:45.093
( Catherine sighs )

04:48.635 --> 04:50.552
Sorry for the inconvenience.

04:58.051 --> 05:00.677
- That is too weird. I mean--
- Woman: I know, right?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.510
- Hey!
- Hi.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.135
What?!

05:05.593 --> 05:08.552
- Where were you hiding?
- I'm not hiding.

05:08.635 --> 05:11.218
Yeah, but the room
was completely empty.

05:11.301 --> 05:12.927
I can-- I can explain.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.343
I'm inside the wall.

05:16.427 --> 05:19.510
( scoffs ) You're--
you're inside the wall?

05:19.593 --> 05:21.844
It's true. I live here.

05:21.927 --> 05:24.802
I'm incredibly bored,
and I was just hoping

05:24.885 --> 05:25.927
we could have a conversation.

05:26.010 --> 05:28.176
No, you're not
inside the wall.

05:29.719 --> 05:31.260
Catherine.

05:33.301 --> 05:37.176
Your name is Catherine Strauss,
you're single,

05:37.260 --> 05:39.218
you just quit your job
at Anderson

05:39.301 --> 05:40.719
because you can't type
at the computer

05:40.802 --> 05:43.385
without back, neck,
and arm pain.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.343
You've just gotten back
from the Peterson clinic,

05:45.427 --> 05:48.301
where another team of doctors
has yet again

05:48.385 --> 05:50.260
been unable to find a diagnosis

05:50.343 --> 05:54.844
for all these strange ailments
that you've been having

05:54.927 --> 05:58.844
this past year...
including the exhaustion.

05:58.927 --> 06:01.927
Oh, and that pain in your shin?

06:02.010 --> 06:04.343
It's been getting worse lately.

06:10.218 --> 06:13.927
Looking for side effects
or something like that?

06:14.010 --> 06:16.218
It's OK. It's OK.

06:16.301 --> 06:19.593
I can be your friend.
You don't have to be afraid.

06:19.677 --> 06:21.844
I am losing my mind.

06:21.927 --> 06:23.719
You are not here.

06:23.802 --> 06:27.343
It's the drugs--
the combination of drugs.

06:27.427 --> 06:29.635
It's not the drugs.

06:29.719 --> 06:32.593
Just shut up,  OK?!

06:32.677 --> 06:34.260
Shut up!

06:34.343 --> 06:35.885
Shut up!

06:37.760 --> 06:39.885
( panting )

06:42.385 --> 06:43.719
Shut up!

07:06.260 --> 07:08.468

08:24.885 --> 08:26.635
Everything.

08:28.552 --> 08:30.343
Anything.

08:40.719 --> 08:42.510
( exhales )

08:45.218 --> 08:48.093
It... started with me

08:48.176 --> 08:50.969
just getting anxious.

08:52.301 --> 08:55.385
Like I was outside of myself

08:55.468 --> 08:56.802
all of a sudden,

08:56.885 --> 08:58.969
looking at my life.

09:00.802 --> 09:03.093
And I just started--

09:03.176 --> 09:06.218
started to have
these little...

09:06.301 --> 09:08.552
panic spells.

09:10.010 --> 09:12.635
Well, then I-- I...

09:12.719 --> 09:15.635
I started not being able
to get up in the morning.

09:15.719 --> 09:17.927
I was sleeping a lot,
I was just--

09:18.010 --> 09:19.552
wasn't sleeping well.

09:19.635 --> 09:21.677
And then I, uh--

09:21.760 --> 09:24.260
I started losing my appetite.

09:25.802 --> 09:27.885
And I lost weight.

09:29.218 --> 09:32.051
And then I got these...

09:32.135 --> 09:35.010
aches and pains in my body.

09:35.093 --> 09:36.719
( sighs )

09:37.885 --> 09:39.552
I saw a therapist,

09:39.635 --> 09:41.677
I saw doctor after doctor

09:41.760 --> 09:43.343
after doctor.

09:43.427 --> 09:45.844
I went to yoga classes

09:45.927 --> 09:48.218
and acupuncture,

09:48.301 --> 09:49.635
acupressure,

09:49.719 --> 09:51.802
Chinese herbs,
more yoga--

09:51.885 --> 09:54.385
I did everything.

09:54.468 --> 10:00.135
I really-- I really
tried everything.

10:00.218 --> 10:01.135
( sighs )

10:01.218 --> 10:03.385
And now I feel like I'm...

10:03.468 --> 10:07.010
going away or something.

10:07.093 --> 10:08.927
And no one can help me.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.969
I can try to help you.

10:12.051 --> 10:15.385
- How?
- Be your friend.

10:15.468 --> 10:17.260
Yeah, I have friends.

10:17.343 --> 10:20.093
- Where are they now?
- Home.

10:20.176 --> 10:21.844
Shouldn't they be with you?

10:21.927 --> 10:23.468
They have
their own lives.

10:23.552 --> 10:24.885
I don't want to bother them.

10:24.969 --> 10:27.844
Respectfully...

10:27.927 --> 10:29.844
wouldn't a real friend know

10:29.927 --> 10:33.468
that you'd never be comfortable
asking them to come with you?

10:33.552 --> 10:36.010
And they'd just book a ticket
and come anyway,

10:36.093 --> 10:38.135
because they knew you,

10:38.218 --> 10:40.635
and they knew
that you needed them.

10:40.719 --> 10:42.802
Even though
you'd never ask.

10:45.135 --> 10:46.677
What about a husband?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.468
Right, you know
all these things about me

10:48.552 --> 10:50.677
but you don't know
that I'm not married?

10:52.885 --> 10:54.427
You're right.

10:54.510 --> 10:57.301
No husband, no boyfriend--
really, you've never

10:57.385 --> 11:01.218
- had a relation--
- OK, thank you
for reminding me.

11:01.301 --> 11:03.218
But it is so crazy.

11:03.301 --> 11:04.844
You're a good-looking woman,

11:04.927 --> 11:06.552
you're smart, you're funny,

11:06.635 --> 11:08.218
you're friendly, nice...

11:08.301 --> 11:11.176
Oh, God, you sound
just like my mother!

11:13.135 --> 11:15.385
Oh, I don't know, I--

11:15.468 --> 11:17.093
I guess I'd like to think

11:17.176 --> 11:21.635
that when the girls and boys
were kissing in middle school,

11:21.719 --> 11:24.927
I was a dancer, and...

11:25.010 --> 11:27.677
I guess I just missed that boat.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.218
And then by the time
they were having sex
in high school,

11:31.301 --> 11:34.927
I was trying to catch up
and have that first kiss.

11:35.010 --> 11:38.635
And... I guess I just...

11:38.719 --> 11:41.010
never really caught up.

11:43.468 --> 11:45.635
Is that what
you really believe?

11:50.218 --> 11:51.343
No.

11:52.927 --> 11:55.593
No, I think that
there is something

11:55.677 --> 11:57.510
really wrong with me,

11:57.593 --> 11:59.885
deep down, that I don't--

12:00.010 --> 12:02.051
that I don't work right.

12:05.343 --> 12:07.301
What if you're not sick?

12:07.385 --> 12:11.093
What if this deep-down feeling

12:11.176 --> 12:14.218
is why all of this
is happening to you?

12:16.051 --> 12:19.719
Why you're just...
going away?

12:25.218 --> 12:28.093
( inhales, exhales )

12:28.176 --> 12:29.218
Maybe.

12:32.593 --> 12:34.635
Do you trust me, Catherine?

12:34.719 --> 12:35.719
Yeah. ( sobs )

12:39.927 --> 12:42.301
I want to try something.

12:42.385 --> 12:44.802
Will you try something
with me?

12:47.760 --> 12:48.885
OK.

12:55.427 --> 12:57.969
We're gonna masturbate
together.

12:58.051 --> 12:59.802
What?! ( laughing )

12:59.885 --> 13:02.010
- ( both laughing )
- Oh, my God.

13:02.093 --> 13:04.218
We're gonna jerk off together.

13:04.301 --> 13:05.427
( laughter continues )

13:05.510 --> 13:07.010
- No.
- Yes!

13:07.093 --> 13:09.301
We are. We're gonna
jerk off together.

13:09.385 --> 13:11.010
- No, we're--
- OK, come on,

13:11.093 --> 13:12.176
this is
gonna be good for you.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.510
Oh, no, I'm not--

13:13.593 --> 13:15.051
I've never been good at this.

13:15.135 --> 13:18.010
Just trust me.
Just trust me.

13:18.093 --> 13:19.677
There's no man in this wall...

13:19.760 --> 13:22.176
- Ohh!
- I do this all the time,

13:22.260 --> 13:24.719
- Great.
- and it-- it always
makes me feel better.

13:24.802 --> 13:28.802
OK, listen, I'm gonna
make you good at this.

13:28.885 --> 13:31.927
- Orgasms are fun.
- Ohh.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.010
They release endorphins
in your brain,

13:35.093 --> 13:37.802
which make you happy,
which heal you,

13:37.885 --> 13:40.051
which make you
more attractive to men--

13:40.135 --> 13:41.844
Do you sort of see where
I'm going with this?

13:41.927 --> 13:44.385
Yes. OK, I'll do it.

13:44.468 --> 13:46.260
Yes!

13:46.343 --> 13:48.844
OK, get comfortable.

13:58.218 --> 13:59.677
( giggles )

14:00.844 --> 14:02.844
OK.

14:02.927 --> 14:05.927
I'm gonna
talk you through it.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.176
Close your eyes.

14:12.343 --> 14:14.677
You're lying
in an empty field.

14:16.176 --> 14:17.844
You're naked.

14:18.969 --> 14:21.802
You feel the sun--

14:21.885 --> 14:25.301
it's warm on your skin--

14:25.385 --> 14:27.510
and it's there to heal you.

14:27.593 --> 14:31.510
And there's a light,
cool breeze.

14:33.260 --> 14:37.010
It tickles you
all over your body...

14:37.093 --> 14:41.969
like a thousand... mmm...
loving fingertips.

14:43.844 --> 14:47.427
It feels sooooo good.

14:49.093 --> 14:50.760
Take a deep breath.

14:50.844 --> 14:54.301
- ( Catherine inhales )
- Now...

14:54.385 --> 14:58.468
let the breeze
penetrate you.

14:58.552 --> 15:02.552
The wind...
it takes over completely now

15:02.635 --> 15:06.468
and it fills you
with a sense of calm.

15:06.552 --> 15:11.010
- It holds you.
- ( Catherine breathing deeply )

15:11.093 --> 15:13.135
The wind is your lover,

15:13.218 --> 15:15.343
kissing you, embracing you,

15:15.427 --> 15:18.635
touching every part of you.

15:18.719 --> 15:21.176
( Catherine panting )

15:21.260 --> 15:22.969
Oh, but now the wind,

15:23.051 --> 15:25.760
it's-- it's getting caught
on something.

15:25.844 --> 15:28.927
Something in your chest
is blocking it.

15:29.051 --> 15:31.427
The sun, it all starts
to go away.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.885
The wind wants to get through,
you want it to get through,

15:34.969 --> 15:36.385
but it just won't.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.010
The clouds are forming now
in the sky.

15:39.093 --> 15:40.844
It's raining. Yes.

15:40.927 --> 15:42.802
You've gotta reach down there
and free it.

15:42.885 --> 15:45.260
You've gotta clear
whatever it is

15:45.343 --> 15:47.343
that is blocking that wind
inside of you, so that--

15:47.427 --> 15:49.176
- Please. I am. I am.
- You are not!

15:49.260 --> 15:51.260
- I can't!
- Catherine, you can!

15:51.343 --> 15:54.093
I can't!
It's always been blocked!

15:54.176 --> 15:57.010
Stop it. You can!
You absolutely can, Catherine.

15:57.093 --> 15:59.260
I believe that you can do this,
you can!

15:59.343 --> 16:01.593
I ca-- I can!

16:01.677 --> 16:05.760
- I ca-- I can! I am!
- Fucking do it!
Get rid of it, Catherine!

16:05.844 --> 16:09.427
- Fucking get rid of it,
Catherine!
- I ca-- Ohh! Ohh!

16:09.510 --> 16:11.677
( gasping ) I can!

16:11.760 --> 16:14.301
I can! Ohh! I can!

16:14.385 --> 16:17.135
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

16:17.218 --> 16:21.010
Ahh... Ahh...

16:22.802 --> 16:26.593
Ahh... Ahh...

16:26.677 --> 16:30.010
( laughs )

16:32.051 --> 16:34.719
( panting )

16:34.802 --> 16:36.969
( laughing )

16:43.093 --> 16:45.135
What's your name?

16:46.260 --> 16:47.635
( laughs )

16:57.468 --> 16:59.218
( door unlocks )

17:11.969 --> 17:14.552
- Let me know
if you need anything else.
- Yep.

17:21.218 --> 17:22.719
Hello?

17:24.593 --> 17:26.510
Are you there?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.593
Of course you're not there.

17:34.677 --> 17:37.385
Because you're a figment
of my imagination

17:37.468 --> 17:39.135
when I was going crazy.

17:39.218 --> 17:41.593
Which makes a lot more sense
than a person in the wall,

17:41.677 --> 17:43.260
you fucking idiot.

17:45.218 --> 17:46.719
I'm here, Catherine.

17:48.343 --> 17:49.927
What's new?

17:52.051 --> 17:53.051
What's new?

17:53.135 --> 17:55.343
Can you see me
right now?

17:55.427 --> 17:56.301
I believe so.

17:56.385 --> 17:58.719
So you can probably guess.

17:58.802 --> 18:00.218
I'm just trying
to break the ice.

18:00.301 --> 18:01.552
Oh, I get it.

18:01.635 --> 18:04.218
You're just trying
to break the ice.

18:04.301 --> 18:05.510
Well, how are you?

18:05.593 --> 18:08.301
I  have crippling Lyme disease.

18:08.385 --> 18:11.635
I am sitting
in a fucking wheelchair

18:11.719 --> 18:14.510
because I can't fucking walk!

18:17.635 --> 18:20.593
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, are you?

18:20.677 --> 18:22.260
I wish that hadn't
happened to you.

18:22.343 --> 18:24.635
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:24.719 --> 18:26.010
Because I'm your friend.

18:26.093 --> 18:28.468
Oh, you're my friend.

18:28.552 --> 18:30.468
Yes, I'm your friend.

18:30.552 --> 18:33.343
I'm your only
real friend.

18:33.427 --> 18:35.176
Shut up.

18:35.260 --> 18:38.510
When I left here,
I stopped seeing doctors.

18:38.593 --> 18:42.927
Do you know that?
I stopped seeing doctors...

18:44.260 --> 18:47.260
and I lost the ability to walk.

18:50.593 --> 18:53.885
I have a disease!
Do you hear me?!

18:53.969 --> 18:55.218
I hear you.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.343
So fuck you!

18:56.427 --> 18:58.010
That's what I came back to say!

18:58.093 --> 19:00.093
Fuck! You!

19:00.176 --> 19:03.176
You made me feel like
this happened to me

19:03.260 --> 19:04.802
because I was weak!

19:06.343 --> 19:08.218
That I-- I brought it on myself!

19:08.301 --> 19:11.010
That it was because
I wasn't strong!

19:11.093 --> 19:12.885

19:12.969 --> 19:15.260
I am strong!

Hello, Catherine.

I'm excited to see you.

20:54.051 --> 20:56.176
Especially looking so well.

20:57.510 --> 20:58.427
Thank you.

21:00.218 --> 21:03.593
- Whoo! Bravo!
- ( Catherine laughs )

21:05.218 --> 21:06.427
No more pain.

21:07.969 --> 21:09.427
No more pain.

21:10.927 --> 21:14.010
And your sweet, loving husband?

21:14.093 --> 21:17.260
Oh, Jeff, he's the best.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.802
I'm so happy for you.

21:20.885 --> 21:24.135
- No luggage.
- No, I-- I can't stay.

21:24.218 --> 21:25.427
OK.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.218
I just...

21:29.301 --> 21:31.719
I wanted to apologize

21:31.802 --> 21:36.260
for the way I treated you
the last time I saw you.

21:36.343 --> 21:38.385
It was a difficult time
for me, and I think

21:38.468 --> 21:40.093
I was looking
for someone to blame,

21:40.176 --> 21:42.969
and I blamed you, even though
you were trying to help me.

21:44.969 --> 21:46.885
The truth is, I don't know

21:46.969 --> 21:50.719
if it was the last round
of medicine or your...

21:50.802 --> 21:52.468
guidance that healed me,

21:52.552 --> 21:54.635
but I am healed.

21:55.885 --> 21:57.135
So thank you.

21:58.468 --> 22:01.969
You don't have to apologize.

22:02.051 --> 22:05.427
I am very, very happy

22:05.510 --> 22:07.010
that you're better.

22:09.427 --> 22:10.802
I love you.

22:13.719 --> 22:17.301
OK, well, anyhow,
I was just--

22:17.385 --> 22:21.010
I just wanted to say that,
and good-bye.

22:21.093 --> 22:23.093
OK.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.677
Good-bye.

22:32.010 --> 22:36.468
- You're still here.
- ( Catherine laughs )

22:36.552 --> 22:38.927
I know.

22:39.010 --> 22:40.218
Why?

22:41.927 --> 22:43.802
I don't know.

22:46.343 --> 22:49.468
Is it because
you're still sad?

22:49.552 --> 22:52.468
No, I-- I told you,
I'm quite well now.

22:52.552 --> 22:56.593
I know, but...
despite it all,

22:56.677 --> 22:58.969
you're still sad.

23:03.218 --> 23:05.176
It's OK.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.427
You can be honest with me.

23:07.510 --> 23:10.260
The truth is...

23:10.343 --> 23:12.010
I'm sad too.

23:13.093 --> 23:14.927
Why?

23:15.010 --> 23:18.051
I'm sad that I'll never
get to see you again.

23:20.719 --> 23:23.885
- But---
- But what? I'm not
a real person,

23:23.969 --> 23:25.510
so it doesn't really matter?

23:25.593 --> 23:27.760
Oh, no, no,
I wasn't gonna say that.

23:27.844 --> 23:30.510
( laughs ) Yeah,
but you were thinking it.

23:33.427 --> 23:35.010
You're right, I was.

23:35.093 --> 23:36.468
It's OK.

23:36.552 --> 23:38.719
Hey, did you ever
talk about me

23:38.802 --> 23:40.093
with your therapist?

23:40.176 --> 23:42.510
( laughs )
You know I didn't.

23:42.593 --> 23:44.802
You thought he'd throw you
in the loony bin

23:44.885 --> 23:47.760
if you told him about
your-- your friend in the wall?

23:47.844 --> 23:50.760
( both laughing )

23:52.010 --> 23:55.802
No, I think I--

23:55.885 --> 23:57.343
I could have
talked about you,

23:57.427 --> 24:01.176
but I didn't want to.

24:01.260 --> 24:02.260
Why not?

24:03.802 --> 24:07.677
I've been trying really hard
to understand all of this,

24:07.760 --> 24:10.093
and I-- I can't.

24:10.176 --> 24:12.552
And I would rather just...

24:14.051 --> 24:17.135
just let it be
whatever it is.

24:19.385 --> 24:20.927
But if you had to guess?

24:22.802 --> 24:26.093
- I can't.
- I'll give you a hint:

24:26.176 --> 24:27.677
I'm not a goblin.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.427
( laughs )

24:32.218 --> 24:36.343
And... I'm not just

24:36.427 --> 24:39.552
a figment of your imagination,

24:39.635 --> 24:42.468
reflecting your own thoughts
back to you.

24:49.468 --> 24:51.635
And you're not crazy.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.844
So what, then?

24:59.677 --> 25:01.301
I am a woman...

25:03.343 --> 25:07.301
and something terrible
happened to me a while ago,

25:07.385 --> 25:10.510
and I've been living here
ever since.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.802
I'm lonely.

25:14.885 --> 25:16.969
I'm looking for a friend--

25:17.051 --> 25:20.427
a true friend--
to help me.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.885
To help you do what?

25:24.176 --> 25:26.510
To believe that I'm real.
