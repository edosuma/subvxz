00:01.420 --> 00:02.924
<i>Kids, Stella Zenman was the girl</i>

00:03.285 --> 00:04.889
<i>I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

00:05.892 --> 00:07.596
<i>Until she left me at the altar,</i>

00:07.596 --> 00:09.842
<i>smashing my heart
to smithereens.</i>

00:09.842 --> 00:11.176
<i>So when I ran into her
seven months later,</i>

00:11.176 --> 00:14.054
<i>there was only one way
to deal with her.</i>

00:14.054 --> 00:15.818
Stella!

00:16.460 --> 00:17.463
Great to see you!

00:17.463 --> 00:18.495
You, too.

00:18.495 --> 00:19.869
And Tony!

00:19.869 --> 00:21.804
Hey.
Hey!

00:21.804 --> 00:23.378
What a nice surprise.

00:23.378 --> 00:25.112
"What a nice surprise"?

00:25.112 --> 00:27.819
No, a nice surprise
would be if a safe fell

00:27.819 --> 00:29.825
from 40 stories
and smushed them both.

00:29.825 --> 00:31.459
I mean, you didn't
let them have it?

00:31.459 --> 00:33.063
No, we had a nice
friendly chat,

00:33.063 --> 00:35.109
then they went their
way and I went mine.

00:35.109 --> 00:36.211
Ted, you blew it.

00:36.211 --> 00:37.545
He blew it, right?

00:39.420 --> 00:40.583
Well played, sir.

00:40.583 --> 00:41.526
Bravo.

00:41.526 --> 00:42.990
What?!
You see, Robin,

00:42.990 --> 00:44.364
Ted played it cool,

00:44.364 --> 00:46.469
which is exactly what
he should have done.

00:46.469 --> 00:49.306
As a matter of fact, I'd say
on a scale ranging from...

00:49.306 --> 00:51.482
(sobbing):
And I kept this sweater
of yours...

00:52.384 --> 00:54.791
...and sometimes I just
sit in the bathtub

00:54.791 --> 00:58.571
for hours just, you know,
just sniffing it.

00:58.571 --> 01:00.075
...all the way to...

01:00.075 --> 01:01.940
This is my new fianc?.

01:01.940 --> 01:03.343
She's basically Stella,

01:03.343 --> 01:04.947
except she's French and,

01:04.947 --> 01:08.096
as you can see,
she's got enormous cans.

01:08.096 --> 01:09.660
<i>Enchant?</i>

01:11.465 --> 01:13.711
<i>Enchant?</i>

01:15.876 --> 01:17.120
(giggles)

01:17.120 --> 01:19.285
...I'd say you nailed it.

01:19.285 --> 01:21.091
I'll do you one better.

01:21.091 --> 01:22.995
You, sir,
got Stella thinking.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.502
"Gosh, Ted seemed
so cool today.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.077
Did I choose
the wrong guy?"

01:27.077 --> 01:29.854
Give it a week;
you'll get her back.

01:29.854 --> 01:31.016
And her front.

01:31.016 --> 01:32.290
(shudders):
Oh.

01:32.922 --> 01:33.894
Oh, did you just feel that?

01:33.894 --> 01:35.900
I think we just had
a "what up" quake.

01:37.303 --> 01:38.577
TED:
I don't want her back.

01:38.577 --> 01:40.582
Or her front.

01:40.582 --> 01:41.745
I just want to move on.

01:41.745 --> 01:43.419
And this was an important
step towards that.

01:43.419 --> 01:44.422
To moving on.

01:44.422 --> 01:46.126
(all murmur)

01:46.126 --> 01:48.102
<i>NARRATOR:
And you know,
I really meant it.</i>

01:48.102 --> 01:51.570
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:53.215
(knocking on door)

01:53.215 --> 01:55.220
(harp glissando plays)

01:55.220 --> 01:56.855
I made a terrible mistake.

01:56.855 --> 01:57.857
I know.

01:57.857 --> 01:59.432
I'm a better person
than you are.

01:59.432 --> 02:00.695
You totally are.

02:00.695 --> 02:01.968
Let's get back together

02:01.968 --> 02:03.672
and have way more sex
than before.
Deal!

02:03.672 --> 02:05.849
(both moaning)

02:05.849 --> 02:08.155
(knocking on door)

02:13.870 --> 02:15.404

No, come in. It's
not weird at all.

02:33.382 --> 02:36.390
Ted, Teddy Ted Ted Ted.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.632
(sighs)

02:37.632 --> 02:40.369
I knew it was wrong
to steal somebody's fianc?.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.345
I mean, I grappled with it.

02:42.345 --> 02:43.307
I was up nights.

02:43.307 --> 02:45.413
And not for the good reason.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.117
Well, sometimes
for the good reason.

02:47.117 --> 02:48.191
I mean, Stella and I

02:48.191 --> 02:49.764
hadn't seen each other
in five years,

02:49.764 --> 02:51.829
so, as you can imagine,
the beginning,

02:51.829 --> 02:53.805
it was just fast and furious.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.740
Lamps breaking,
furniture moving.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.783
You see this bald patch?

02:56.783 --> 02:57.715
Yeah, Tony...

02:57.715 --> 02:59.791
Anyway, we moved on.

02:59.791 --> 03:02.699
Me, Lucy, Stella--
we were gonna move to L.A.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.433
I was gonna become
a screenwriter.

03:05.205 --> 03:06.309
Then we bumped into you,

03:06.309 --> 03:09.947
and you just looked so... sad.

03:09.947 --> 03:11.221
Sad? No.

03:11.221 --> 03:13.928
I-I think what you're
calling sad was actually

03:13.928 --> 03:16.094
a jovial nonchalance.

03:16.094 --> 03:17.698
Ted, you looked awful, okay?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.904
Like a little dachshund puppy
with a bad back

03:19.904 --> 03:22.180
that's got to pull itself around
on a cart.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.153
Why are you here?

03:23.153 --> 03:25.388
Look, Ted,

03:25.388 --> 03:27.063
I know I can come across
pretty tough,

03:27.063 --> 03:29.770
but I can't bear to have hurt
someone the way I hurt you.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.474
I think fate put me

03:31.474 --> 03:33.681
on that corner
to make this right.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.217
Obviously, I can't fill
that giant crater

03:36.217 --> 03:37.751
that Stella left
in your heart.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.894
I've been dating.

03:38.894 --> 03:39.926
Like, a lot.

03:39.926 --> 03:41.060
And then I heard you got fired.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.934
I transitioned into
small business ownership.

03:42.934 --> 03:43.907
(clears throat)

03:43.907 --> 03:45.412
It's the backbone
of the economy.

03:45.412 --> 03:46.574
No, it's not.

03:46.574 --> 03:47.748
Ted,

03:47.748 --> 03:49.121
my family's got a lot of money.

03:49.121 --> 03:51.087
And I want to use that money

03:51.087 --> 03:52.590
to make this right with you.

03:53.092 --> 03:54.466
Tony is rich?

03:54.466 --> 03:55.939
Oh, Ted.

03:55.939 --> 03:59.709
Oh, Ted, tell me
he wrote you a check.

03:59.709 --> 04:02.055
Tell me he wrote you

04:02.055 --> 04:04.261
a big, fat check.

04:04.261 --> 04:05.494
A check so big

04:05.494 --> 04:07.369
it doesn't take its shirt off
when it goes swimming.

04:07.369 --> 04:09.505
(laughs)
Ha, that is a
big, fat check.

04:09.505 --> 04:11.681
A check so big, if
you had sex with it,

04:11.681 --> 04:12.945
you wouldn't tell
your buddies.

04:12.945 --> 04:14.889
That is a big, fat check.

04:14.889 --> 04:18.730
A check so big that when you sit
next to it on an airplane,

04:18.730 --> 04:19.902
you find yourself wondering

04:19.902 --> 04:21.637
whether the check should have
bought two seats.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.439
That...

04:22.439 --> 04:25.176
Is a big,
fat check!

04:25.176 --> 04:27.423
Yeah! He didn't
write me a check.

04:27.423 --> 04:29.087
Ted, I want to offer you a job.

04:29.087 --> 04:29.929
A job?

04:29.929 --> 04:31.093
Every year, my family gives

04:31.093 --> 04:32.867
a lot of money
to Columbia University,

04:32.867 --> 04:34.240
so I got some pull.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.203
How would you like

04:35.203 --> 04:36.747
to design...

04:36.747 --> 04:39.013
<i>NARRATOR:

04:39.013 --> 04:40.016
<i>A new library?</i>

04:40.016 --> 04:41.018
<i>A new student center?</i>

04:41.018 --> 04:42.894
...your very own curriculum

04:42.894 --> 04:44.798
as a professor of architecture.

04:44.798 --> 04:46.102
(chuckles)

04:46.102 --> 04:47.104
Huh?

04:47.104 --> 04:48.278
No, thanks.

04:48.278 --> 04:51.546
What do you mean,
"No, thanks"?

04:51.546 --> 04:53.822
Ted, you would be

04:53.822 --> 04:56.158
a great professor, okay?

04:56.158 --> 04:59.036
You are knowledgeable,
you're a good talker,

04:59.036 --> 05:02.044
and when you need to,

05:02.044 --> 05:04.019
you can grow
a very handsome neck beard.

05:04.019 --> 05:04.981
(both laugh)

05:04.981 --> 05:06.626
I'm not gonna
be a professor.

05:06.626 --> 05:08.461
Teaching architecture is
what you do when your career

05:08.461 --> 05:10.837
has totally bottomed out and
you need to pay the bills.

05:10.837 --> 05:11.970

I'm not gonna take
that job, all right?

05:17.384 --> 05:18.558
I'm gonna be just fine.

05:18.558 --> 05:19.590
New topic.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.325
Okay, new topic.

05:21.325 --> 05:25.005
I just got a $200
speeding ticket today.

05:25.005 --> 05:26.338
Oh, that sucks, dude.

05:26.338 --> 05:27.581
You couldn't
talk your way out of it?

05:27.581 --> 05:29.486
You can't talk your
way out of a ticket.

05:29.486 --> 05:31.121
I've done it.

05:31.121 --> 05:32.795
It was-- what was it?--

05:32.795 --> 05:34.400
it was 1998.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.465
So where's the fire?

05:36.465 --> 05:38.109
There's no fire.

05:40.876 --> 05:42.621
Actually, uh,
you know, there is a fire

05:42.621 --> 05:43.924
at this barbecue I'm headed to.

05:43.924 --> 05:44.927
Nothing special.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.293
Burgers, ribs.... brats.

05:47.293 --> 05:51.344
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...

05:51.344 --> 05:53.550
Did you say brats?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.315
Yeah, brats.

05:55.315 --> 05:56.688
My mom marinates them

05:56.688 --> 05:58.693
in Belgian beer for two days.
No big.

05:58.693 --> 05:59.826
Funny thing was,
I could've

05:59.826 --> 06:03.807
sworn that one of those thick,
succulent,

06:03.807 --> 06:06.745
hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.

06:06.745 --> 06:08.218
Weird. Anyways,
what were you saying?

06:08.218 --> 06:09.823
What-what did it say?

06:09.823 --> 06:11.256
The brat?

06:11.256 --> 06:16.511
It said "Property of Minnesota
State Trooper Jorgensen."

06:16.511 --> 06:21.383
You a... you a brat man,
Officer Jorgensen?

06:23.759 --> 06:25.595
You going to this address?
Mm-hmm.

06:25.595 --> 06:26.797
Follow me and lean on the horn.

06:26.797 --> 06:28.503
We're gonna be running
some reds.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.613
Well, duh.

06:32.613 --> 06:33.786
I would've done that, too,

06:33.786 --> 06:35.922
if I'd have been going
to a barbecue.

06:35.922 --> 06:37.165
Damn, I was.

06:37.165 --> 06:39.070
See, it's all about
sizing up your opponent.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.235
I could tell that the officer
was a brat man

06:41.235 --> 06:43.111
because, well,
he was out of breath just from

06:43.111 --> 06:47.321
walking to my car and he had
mustard on his holster.

06:47.321 --> 06:49.498
Marshall Eriksen!

06:49.498 --> 06:52.606
Manipulating an officer
of the law with your sausage.

06:52.606 --> 06:54.039
MARSHALL:
Mm-hmm.
That is very hot.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.920
You think I can't talk
my way out of a ticket?!

06:58.421 --> 07:00.186
You think I can't

07:00.186 --> 07:02.130
talk my way out of a ticket?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.635
I am Barney
Stinson,

07:03.635 --> 07:06.141
master of manipulation.

07:06.141 --> 07:09.250
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,

07:09.250 --> 07:11.616
I think I can talk
my way out of a ticket.

07:11.616 --> 07:14.022
Challenge accep-- Wait for it.

07:14.493 --> 07:15.998
(chuckles)

07:15.998 --> 07:17.872
I don't get it.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.582
Oh, "Ted."

07:21.582 --> 07:23.417
"Accep-Ted."

07:23.417 --> 07:24.450
I get it now.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.523
(knocking on door)

07:26.956 --> 07:28.060
What now?

07:28.060 --> 07:30.405
You want to be an architect?
Great.

07:30.405 --> 07:33.173
Guy I went to private school
with wants a new house built.

07:33.173 --> 07:34.517
Job's yours if you want it.

07:34.517 --> 07:37.053
Tony, look,
I don't need your help.

07:37.053 --> 07:38.557
Here's what he's offering you.

07:42.768 --> 07:45.475
That is a big, fat check.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.599
Showtime.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.073
License and
registration.

07:56.073 --> 07:57.477
Oh, of course, Officer.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.683
Right away.

08:03.593 --> 08:05.458
Sir, this is a gift certificate

08:05.458 --> 08:07.504
for a custom-tailored
Italian suit.

08:07.504 --> 08:10.040
So, we done here?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.276
$375!

08:12.276 --> 08:13.349
Ooh!
(chuckles):
Oh.

08:13.349 --> 08:14.682
And he kept
the gift certificates.

08:14.682 --> 08:15.725
Oh, man.

08:15.725 --> 08:17.359
I'm gonna call Emilio
and tell him

08:17.359 --> 08:18.864
to short-sheet him
on the crotch.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.367
You are bad at this, dude.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.574
Oh, whatever, Robin.

08:22.574 --> 08:24.779
Like you've ever
talked your way out of a ticket.

08:24.779 --> 08:26.113
Are you kidding me?

08:26.113 --> 08:27.185
Robin's a pretty girl.

08:27.185 --> 08:28.359
Pretty girls don't get tickets.

08:28.359 --> 08:30.324
I bet Robin's been
pulled over tons of times,

08:30.324 --> 08:31.397
never once gotten a ticket.

08:31.397 --> 08:34.134
That is outrageous!

08:34.134 --> 08:35.778
And factual.

08:35.778 --> 08:37.613
License and regis...

08:37.613 --> 08:38.846
(sobbing)

08:38.846 --> 08:40.852
Oh, honey.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.529
Oh, no, no,
no, don't cry.

08:43.529 --> 08:45.604
It's okay. No
ticket for you.

08:45.604 --> 08:46.767
Oh.

08:46.767 --> 08:49.144
Just, uh, go a little
slower next time, okay?

08:49.144 --> 08:50.647
Yeah.
Okay.

08:53.986 --> 08:56.593
Thank you.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.468
Yeah!

08:58.468 --> 08:59.540
Excuse me.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.506
I think I left something
in New Jersey.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.284
Hey!

09:04.284 --> 09:06.118
How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?

09:06.118 --> 09:09.367
Well, uh, it started off great.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.332
<i>TED:
I want to design a house that</i>

09:11.332 --> 09:13.037
celebrates the landscape
without overpowering it.

09:13.037 --> 09:14.009
Mm.

09:14.009 --> 09:15.242
You know,
when Frank Lloyd Wright

09:15.242 --> 09:17.618
designed Fallingwater
in 1935, there's...

09:17.618 --> 09:19.323
Yes, yes, that's all fine.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.797
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

09:20.797 --> 09:23.063
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.968
Specifically the laundry room.

09:24.968 --> 09:26.242
The laundry room?

09:26.242 --> 09:30.151
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,

09:30.151 --> 09:33.932
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.

09:33.932 --> 09:36.338
I'm a man who likes to do
his own laundry,

09:36.338 --> 09:38.804
and sometimes, it gets messy.

09:38.804 --> 09:41.382
Messy?
Messy.

09:41.382 --> 09:43.718
Steel chains will dangle
from the ceiling

09:43.718 --> 09:45.221
at a height of nine feet.

09:45.221 --> 09:47.798
And that is where
my laundry bags

09:47.798 --> 09:50.736
will hang for three days
and three nights

09:50.736 --> 09:54.014
before I... clean them.

09:54.014 --> 09:56.992
Uh, Ted, it-it kind of
sounds like

09:56.992 --> 09:58.898
what this guy is asking you
to design...

09:58.898 --> 10:00.702
It's a murder house.
It is.

10:00.702 --> 10:02.066
It's totally a murder house.

10:02.066 --> 10:04.242
You know, as a
martial artist,

10:04.242 --> 10:06.146
I'm trained to
trust my instincts,

10:06.146 --> 10:10.829
and my instincts are saying
this... feels very good.

10:10.829 --> 10:13.436
The steak is so rare.

10:13.436 --> 10:14.970
(shudders)

10:14.970 --> 10:17.678
Right? Right?!

10:17.678 --> 10:21.216
One final concern:
soundproofing.

10:21.216 --> 10:25.398
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.

10:25.398 --> 10:27.533
I'll show you what I mean.

10:27.533 --> 10:29.409
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,

10:29.409 --> 10:31.684
and you tell me
if you can hear me.

10:35.354 --> 10:36.898
Tony...

10:36.898 --> 10:38.802
does something feel off
about this guy?

10:38.802 --> 10:41.470
Yeah. Off the hook!

10:41.470 --> 10:43.475
Bro, you are
nailing this.

10:43.475 --> 10:44.979
(chain saw revving)

10:44.979 --> 10:46.684
(maniacal laughter)

10:46.684 --> 10:48.358
Ted, you can't design
a murder house!

10:48.358 --> 10:49.632
I'm not gonna design
a murder house.

10:49.632 --> 10:50.635
Ted, you can't design
a murder house!

10:50.635 --> 10:52.238
I'm not gonna design
a murder house!

10:53.902 --> 10:55.276
(engine accelerating)

10:55.276 --> 10:57.011
(siren blips)

10:57.652 --> 10:59.689
Bring it.

10:59.689 --> 11:02.325
Officer, please,
my wife is about to have a baby!

11:02.325 --> 11:03.327
Her water just broke!

11:03.327 --> 11:04.370
Where's your wife?

11:04.370 --> 11:05.775
She took the other car.

11:05.775 --> 11:09.614
This is Italian leather, so...

11:09.614 --> 11:13.053
I... Oh, come...

11:13.053 --> 11:15.229
I'm sorry about that
murder house thing.

11:15.229 --> 11:16.603
That was my bad.

11:16.603 --> 11:17.937
That's on me.

11:17.937 --> 11:19.069
So, new plan.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.546
You, my friend, are gonna build

11:21.546 --> 11:24.985
the Statue of Liberty a husband.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.461
Now, I got some suction
down at City Hall.

11:27.461 --> 11:28.464
Tony, stop it!

11:28.464 --> 11:29.868
I don't want your help, okay?

11:29.868 --> 11:31.101
You don't have to do this.

11:31.101 --> 11:32.505
Yes, I do.
Why?

11:32.505 --> 11:35.082
Because...

11:35.082 --> 11:38.992
when you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.

11:38.992 --> 11:41.328
I can only imagine you feel
the same way.

11:41.328 --> 11:44.035
(laughs)
Okay, well,

11:44.035 --> 11:46.682
let me put your mind a

11:46.682 --> 11:49.088
I don't want Stella back, okay?

11:49.088 --> 11:51.354
She lied to me
and left me at the altar.

11:51.354 --> 11:52.929
What kind of person does that?

11:53.932 --> 11:55.365
I'm better off without her.

11:55.365 --> 11:56.669
She's all yours, buddy.

12:00.548 --> 12:02.053
There you go.

12:02.053 --> 12:03.586
Load off my mind.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.532
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>

12:05.532 --> 12:08.500
<i>and I began to put this whole
business far behind me.</i>

12:08.500 --> 12:10.345
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

12:10.345 --> 12:12.610
(knocking on door)

12:12.611 --> 12:13.513
Stella...

12:13.615 --> 12:16.021
Tony broke up with me.

12:21.935 --> 12:24.813
Wow. Okay,
Tony broke up with you?

12:24.813 --> 12:27.389
He said it was because
of something you said.

12:27.389 --> 12:29.425
You got Tony
to dump Stella?

12:29.425 --> 12:32.403
I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have to insist

12:32.403 --> 12:33.866
that you bump this.

12:35.010 --> 12:37.316
Let's, um, let's talk
out in the hall.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.822
It'll be waiting.

12:41.959 --> 12:46.741
So, why are you here?

12:46.741 --> 12:50.180
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late,

12:50.180 --> 12:51.854
but here goes.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.524
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.

12:56.266 --> 12:57.529
We dated for a long time,

12:57.529 --> 13:01.279
but then I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds

13:01.279 --> 13:03.785
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.

13:03.785 --> 13:08.097
And for a long time I just
focused on being a mother.

13:08.097 --> 13:11.135
I forgot about Tony.
I forgot about...

13:11.135 --> 13:14.344
the very idea of being in love.

13:15.516 --> 13:17.953
And then you came along
and reminded me.

13:17.953 --> 13:20.530
And... I loved you for that.

13:21.393 --> 13:23.969
I loved you so much, in fact,

13:23.969 --> 13:27.909
that it was just shy of enough.

13:29.915 --> 13:32.722
But I never stopped loving Tony.

13:33.664 --> 13:36.903
Take him back, honey.
He's sorry.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.410
No, that's-that's not...
that's not what's happening.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.786
Just go back inside,
Mrs. Matsen.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.824
(door closes)

13:44.824 --> 13:47.160
It was good seeing you, Stella.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.205
Can you talk to Tony?

13:51.672 --> 13:53.046
What?

13:53.046 --> 13:54.450
He'd listen to you.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.385
You changed his mind.
You could change it back.

13:56.385 --> 13:58.460
I know it's an awful thing
to ask...

13:58.460 --> 14:00.766
Yeah, it's an awful thing
to ask.

14:00.766 --> 14:03.173
Well, I don't know
what else to do, okay?

14:03.173 --> 14:04.446
I love him.

14:04.446 --> 14:05.910
Oh, you love him.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.858
So what, you're-you're appealing
to the romantic in me?

14:09.690 --> 14:10.923
Is that your strategy?

14:10.923 --> 14:13.530
Because that guy's gone.

14:13.530 --> 14:14.874
You can't pull
those strings anymore.

14:14.874 --> 14:18.243
They're not attached
to anything thanks to you.

14:18.243 --> 14:20.087
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!

14:20.087 --> 14:22.594
Go inside,
Mrs. Matsen!
Mrs. Matsen,
go inside!

14:24.600 --> 14:27.938
Okay, you can do this.
You can do this!

14:27.938 --> 14:31.848
<i>Oh, you can do this.</i>

14:31.848 --> 14:34.124
License and regis...
License and registration.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.558
Excuse me?

14:35.558 --> 14:37.332
I can only assume
you need a license

14:37.332 --> 14:39.268
to have a face that beautiful.

14:39.268 --> 14:40.802
And that body?

14:40.802 --> 14:43.750
<i>I'm guessing something that
explosive has to be registered</i>

14:43.750 --> 14:46.717
with the proper authorities.

14:46.717 --> 14:48.061
Get out of the car.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.528
Why, am I under arrest?

14:50.528 --> 14:54.338
No...

14:54.338 --> 14:57.717
but you're about to be
under me.

15:01.396 --> 15:03.432
No. False.
Did not happen.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.337
That's a line
from a porno.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.771
I've seen that porno.

15:06.771 --> 15:08.716
Hell, I've made
that porno.

15:08.716 --> 15:10.751
When will you guys realize
that the only difference

15:10.751 --> 15:12.386
between my real life and a porno

15:12.386 --> 15:14.090
is my real life
has better lighting?

15:14.090 --> 15:15.464
You're lying.

15:15.464 --> 15:16.867
I am not lying!

15:16.867 --> 15:19.373
I swear on my mother.

15:19.373 --> 15:21.550
I swear
on Goliath National Bank.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.114
I swear on my suits.

15:23.114 --> 15:24.116
I...

15:24.116 --> 15:25.118
am...

15:25.118 --> 15:26.121
not...

15:26.121 --> 15:27.395
lying.

15:27.395 --> 15:30.072
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>

15:30.072 --> 15:32.137
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

15:32.137 --> 15:34.614
Go inside,
Mrs. Matsen!
Mrs. Matsen,
go inside!

15:37.622 --> 15:39.728
Is there anything I can do
to make this better?

15:39.728 --> 15:41.362
No.

15:41.362 --> 15:45.042
* Let's go to the mall,
everybody! *

15:45.042 --> 15:46.816
Hello.

15:46.816 --> 15:48.451
Ted, it's me! It's Barney
It's me! I need your help!

15:48.451 --> 15:49.553
I'm in big trouble!

15:49.553 --> 15:52.131
Whoa-whoa-whoa, slow down.
What happened?

15:52.962 --> 15:53.995
I'm guessing something

15:53.995 --> 15:55.770
<i>that explosive
has to be registered</i>

15:55.770 --> 15:58.177
with the proper authorities.

15:58.177 --> 15:59.480
Get out of the car.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.655
Why, am I under arrest?

16:01.655 --> 16:02.558
Yes, you are.

16:02.558 --> 16:03.691
I ran your plates.

16:03.691 --> 16:04.924
You've had 15 moving violations

16:04.924 --> 16:06.198
in the last three days.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.571
Get out of the car.

16:07.571 --> 16:09.607
But no, my wife's having a baby!

16:09.607 --> 16:11.541
I have a sausage
with your name on it!

16:11.541 --> 16:12.645
Out of the car now!

16:12.645 --> 16:13.787
(screaming)

16:13.787 --> 16:16.494
I need you to come
to Brazzaville, New Jersey

16:16.494 --> 16:17.557
and bail me out.

16:17.557 --> 16:19.332
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

16:19.332 --> 16:20.635
Hurry, Ted.

16:20.635 --> 16:22.370
You have no idea of the kind
of the hardened criminals

16:22.370 --> 16:23.643
they've got me in here with.

16:23.643 --> 16:26.220
Are we gonna get
our spray paint back?

16:26.220 --> 16:29.328
Save me, Ted!

16:29.328 --> 16:31.895
You want to do
something for me?

16:31.895 --> 16:33.470
I need a ride to New Jersey.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.244
Okay.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.778
You'll pay for tolls, right?

16:37.580 --> 16:38.753
I'm kidding.

16:40.388 --> 16:42.865
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>

16:42.865 --> 16:44.970
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney
out of jail</i>

16:44.970 --> 16:46.503
<i>and drove all the way home.</i>

16:46.503 --> 16:48.780
Oh, by the way, Ted, how's
that girl you've been seeing?

16:48.780 --> 16:51.688
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?

16:51.688 --> 16:53.352
Oh, you mean Claudette?

16:53.352 --> 16:55.828
She's, uh,
she's fine.

16:55.828 --> 16:59.107
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.

16:59.107 --> 17:02.275
Ever! Bye, Stella.

17:02.275 --> 17:03.920
Bye.

17:05.684 --> 17:10.468
Ted... I'm so sorry again
about everything.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.542
For what it's worth...

17:12.542 --> 17:13.744
I'll talk to Tony.

17:13.744 --> 17:15.580
Really?

17:15.580 --> 17:18.156
I want you to be happy, Stella.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.761
I'll talk to him.

17:19.761 --> 17:21.165
<i>And I did.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:24.103
<i>I don't remember
what I said to him,</i>

17:24.103 --> 17:26.208
<i>but I guess I changed his mind</i>

17:26.208 --> 17:29.888
<i>because the next day,
they flew to California.</i>

17:29.888 --> 17:32.696
<i>Stella set up a new dermatology
practice.</i>

17:32.696 --> 17:34.361
<i>And against all odds,</i>

17:34.361 --> 17:36.566
<i>Tony found some success
as a screenwriter.</i>

17:36.566 --> 17:40.076
<i>His movie, The Wedding Bride,
was a big hit.</i>

17:40.076 --> 17:42.181
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>

17:42.181 --> 17:43.625
Okay, but just
tell me this.

17:43.625 --> 17:44.958
Why Tony?

17:44.958 --> 17:48.167
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?

17:48.167 --> 17:51.044
Like, what...
what is it?

17:51.044 --> 17:53.009
He's the one.

17:53.882 --> 17:56.258
The one.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.697
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,
but, yeah.

18:03.537 --> 18:06.385
Okay, I'm gonna say something
out loud that I've been doing

18:06.385 --> 18:09.453
a pretty good job of not
saying out loud lately.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.862
What you and Tony have--

18:12.862 --> 18:16.371
what I thought for a second
you and I had...

18:17.343 --> 18:21.826
...what I know that Marshall
and Lily have...

18:21.826 --> 18:23.490
I want that.

18:24.392 --> 18:26.969
I do.

18:26.969 --> 18:29.947
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen,

18:29.947 --> 18:32.082
and...

18:32.082 --> 18:35.792
I guess I'm just, um...

18:35.792 --> 18:38.168
I'm tired of waiting.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.212
And that is all I'm going
to say on that subject.

18:47.653 --> 18:50.531
You know, I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket?

18:50.531 --> 18:51.664
Really?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.870
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house

18:53.870 --> 18:55.745
doing, like, 90
on this country road,

18:55.745 --> 18:57.450
and I got pulled over.

18:57.450 --> 18:59.384
So this cop gets out of his car.

18:59.384 --> 19:02.232
He kind of swaggers on over
and he's, like, "Young lady,

19:02.232 --> 19:05.000
I have been waiting for you
all day."

19:05.000 --> 19:08.579
So I looked up at him and I
said, "I'm so sorry, Officer.

19:08.579 --> 19:10.484
I got here as fast as I could."

19:10.484 --> 19:12.690
(chuckles):
For real?

19:12.690 --> 19:14.294
(laughs softly):
No.

19:14.294 --> 19:15.668
It's an old joke.

19:19.679 --> 19:22.386
I know that you're
tired of waiting,

19:22.386 --> 19:25.454
and you may have to wait
a little while more,

19:25.454 --> 19:28.532
but she's on her way, Ted.

19:29.634 --> 19:34.217
And she's getting here
as fast as she can.

19:43.501 --> 19:44.744
Bye, Stella.

19:44.744 --> 19:47.411
Good-bye, Ted.

19:47.411 --> 19:49.116
* If it ever ends

19:49.116 --> 19:54.731
* And somehow, you have
shattered my defense *

19:54.731 --> 19:58.682
* And this is gonna hurt

19:58.682 --> 20:02.451
* If it ever starts

20:02.451 --> 20:05.459
* So promise you'll be careful

20:05.459 --> 20:09.068
* With my heart

20:18.092 --> 20:20.739
She tracked me down two days
later using a phone book.

20:20.739 --> 20:23.847
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.181
(both chuckle)

20:25.181 --> 20:26.454
Hey.

20:26.454 --> 20:27.888
Hey, Lily!
Lily!

20:27.888 --> 20:29.723
You're back!

20:29.723 --> 20:31.969
Barney, when you told me

20:31.969 --> 20:33.734
that peanut butter
and jam joke,

20:33.734 --> 20:35.939
I was completely
disgusted.

20:36.882 --> 20:38.616
But I was in the shower
this morning

20:38.616 --> 20:39.950
and it popped
into my head

20:39.950 --> 20:41.955
and it actually
made me laugh.

20:41.955 --> 20:43.430
Peanut butter.

20:44.332 --> 20:46.909
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.

20:46.909 --> 20:48.613
Marshall's words,
not mine.

20:49.746 --> 20:51.551
Well, it's good to
see you again, Lily.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.584
Thanks.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.957
So what have you
been up to?

20:53.957 --> 20:55.532
I'm going to an
amnesia ward

20:55.532 --> 20:57.396
with a bunch of photos
of my children

20:57.396 --> 20:58.600
and a wedding ring.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.675
I'm gonna find the hottest
patient/my wife,

21:00.675 --> 21:02.009
and we are going...

21:02.009 --> 21:04.756
Okay, so that's good
enough for tonight.

21:04.756 --> 21:06.119
I gotta ease back
into this.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.123
See you tomorrow!
