01:53.989 --> 01:55.240
You just a girl!

01:56.825 --> 02:00.454
Hey kids, you should be
playing with real guns

02:12.049 --> 02:13.258
Hello, papa

02:13.508 --> 02:16.219
Angel, why aren't you playing
with other girls?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.973
They just just boring

02:20.390 --> 02:22.100
Play with guns?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.644
And you, Rico?
Why aren't you playing with the boys?

02:26.938 --> 02:28.190
Very well then

02:28.982 --> 02:30.484
Can you do your father a favor?

02:30.901 --> 02:31.651
Yes, papa

02:32.069 --> 02:36.907
Can you put on a fine dress and make-up to show
my guests what a beautiful young lady you are

02:37.824 --> 02:38.575
Yes, papa

02:49.378 --> 02:51.088
Beautiful party

02:54.174 --> 02:55.675
Don’t you think, you got to much
to drink?

02:55.675 --> 02:58.011
I have to be drunk to support
you

02:59.054 --> 03:00.305
You don’t speak that shit

03:01.306 --> 03:03.767
Its lovely to have you here
guys.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.727
The kids play fantastic together

03:06.520 --> 03:07.854
Give me the gun kid

03:08.271 --> 03:10.649
If you touch my mother again,
I’m gonna l kill you!

03:12.109 --> 03:13.527
- Give me the gun!
- Go and get it

03:15.445 --> 03:16.822
That’s my boy!

03:27.833 --> 03:29.251
Papa?

03:39.302 --> 03:41.346
Seven hundred seventy seven

03:41.346 --> 03:42.639
Not active

03:51.064 --> 03:54.484
Angel, you should be in bed

03:59.156 --> 04:04.453
No, Angel, no. There's more
to be feared than admired

04:06.455 --> 04:08.373
Tell me, what do you see?

04:08.999 --> 04:12.043
Something that makes the weak strong and the strong weak

04:13.253 --> 04:17.757
It's a last resort. And when you have to resort,
you’re already lost

04:18.757 --> 04:20.760
Come

04:26.516 --> 04:28.518
This path is not for you

04:28.935 --> 04:30.353
Why not, papa?

04:31.229 --> 04:35.358
My little rose, I wish you have
a happy life

04:35.650 --> 04:38.487
A life different from mine

04:39.821 --> 04:43.658
What about power?
I hear you and Rico's dad talk about that

04:43.950 --> 04:52.542
A fleeting illusion. Power makes you a target.
Being a target makes you weak

04:52.876 --> 04:56.004
You're not weak, papa.
You're the strongest man I know.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.217
Strength diminishes, doesn't
last

05:00.967 --> 05:02.969
Now off to bed

05:12.062 --> 05:17.108
You two should visit more often.
Just because to see our children play together

05:17.442 --> 05:19.611
It's a long flight from L.A. to
Spain.

05:19.903 --> 05:23.573
Business keeps me busy.
Guess that’s why they call it business

05:23.823 --> 05:26.785
But I would not miss your
sixtieth birthday Antonio.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
Why you don't speak Spanish?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.540
I understand all man
but I speak like shit!

05:33.542 --> 05:35.627
As long I making mucho denero
it's all good man

07:10.805 --> 07:12.807
Rico, wake up.
I heard something

07:13.642 --> 07:14.476
Angel?

07:15.310 --> 07:17.103
Something is going on!

07:37.040 --> 07:39.292
Did you see.
Nothing to worry about

07:52.722 --> 07:54.724
You first

07:59.229 --> 08:03.066
This Antonio is from Raffaello

08:04.234 --> 08:05.735
Antonio

08:07.237 --> 08:08.697
Your daughter's gonna be next

08:09.489 --> 08:10.323
You're very lucky

08:11.074 --> 08:13.702
We would have killed her
in front of you and your wife

08:14.577 --> 08:16.037
But we haven't found her

08:16.371 --> 08:16.955
Yet

08:18.540 --> 08:19.708
Go to hell!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.334
Leave no one alive!

08:41.980 --> 08:43.982
Come out, come out!

08:44.649 --> 08:47.235
Where ever you are, little
bitch!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.258
Daddy, daddy!

09:11.926 --> 09:13.928
Give me the gun son!

09:15.221 --> 09:17.223
I thought I finished you out!

09:18.433 --> 09:19.559
Mami!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.980
Ah there you are. We were
looking for you

09:24.606 --> 09:26.691
Please, please don't hurt my
cousin,

09:26.691 --> 09:27.901
Hurt me instead

09:37.619 --> 09:39.621
There's a gun at the door!
- Go get it!

09:42.332 --> 09:43.666
Do you know how to use it?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.793
Better than you

09:47.003 --> 09:49.547
- Seven hundred seventy seven
- Machine activated

09:50.131 --> 09:51.466
There you are little girl

10:07.315 --> 10:09.025
Where is every everybody?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.610
Get the fuck in get the little
bitch!

10:11.653 --> 10:12.445
Bastards!

10:24.541 --> 10:26.543
- Mission accomplished?
- Mission abolished!

11:22.765 --> 11:24.767
- Just look at her
- Kinda hard to.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.145
So what happens to her now?

11:27.562 --> 11:31.065
After that bloodbath,
she'll be remanded to a juvenile facility

11:33.026 --> 11:34.068
For how long?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.905
She's got no relatives.
They all died in that house

11:37.155 --> 11:41.743
Except for some lowlife Mexican cartel
hitman uncle whose gone underground

11:42.744 --> 11:44.078
and her cousin Rico.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.121
Don’t worry about that kid

11:45.121 --> 11:48.416
He's American, he is being shipped back to the States.
He is their problem now.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.170
It just sounds to me like she's being punished for defending herself

11:52.962 --> 11:54.255
Did you see that carnage?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.173
Yes I did

11:55.173 --> 11:58.343
This self-defense,
that was something else.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.511
Did you see the bodies?

12:00.511 --> 12:03.473
- Yes I did
- I did, was friggin' slaughterhouse.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.726
Besides her father is a mobster.
A killer.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.937
Must run in the family.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.939
No she is just a child

12:11.272 --> 12:13.608
So what you wanna do?
She goes into the system?

12:14.192 --> 12:15.652
Yeah into the system.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.688
I don’t know where if it's comferts to take away your sadness

12:55.775 --> 12:58.319
or bring back your loss

13:09.622 --> 13:13.501
Everyone is talking about you,
what you did

13:25.638 --> 13:27.682
Do you know who I am?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.308
No

13:31.227 --> 13:32.854
Raffaello Vasquez

13:46.117 --> 13:47.827

14:00.840 --> 14:02.216
You like guns?

14:02.508 --> 14:05.428
What do you think?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.100
You are a very young interesting
girl

14:32.413 --> 14:34.415
Take care of yourself, Angel.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.018
It's all good. She hast no idea

14:54.393 --> 14:56.395
but keep her locked up!

14:57.438 --> 15:00.399
Guilliemo, help him out.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.488

15:05.738 --> 15:07.573
What does he want?

15:07.573 --> 15:08.699

I’d gladly report your ass

16:28.070 --> 16:29.947

16:30.573 --> 16:32.366

16:35.620 --> 16:39.707
and I'm happy to be shot of you!

16:40.082 --> 16:45.630
I sure hope it's a nightstick
pressing up against me

16:49.550 --> 16:51.552
Move your ass, inmate!

16:57.350 --> 17:02.897
Ok, so checking with your P.O. officer regularly bases

19:29.919 --> 19:32.797
Sweet as ever, my little

19:33.255 --> 19:36.217
Crazy Rico, my little matador

19:37.093 --> 19:40.888
Anyway... this is a celebration

19:41.222 --> 19:42.056
Yeah?

19:43.057 --> 19:44.475
A celebration of what?

19:44.767 --> 19:47.144
We're both out at the same time

19:48.729 --> 19:51.148
Prison, yeah. I'm seen my share

19:52.108 --> 19:54.652
I’m never going back. Never

19:55.945 --> 19:58.614
That what you said the last two
times

20:03.661 --> 20:07.331
It's like fire in the throat.
But it's better than prison wine

20:08.666 --> 20:12.086
We got to get out
of this small times shit!

20:13.212 --> 20:17.299
We gotta stop the poverty
mentality

20:18.926 --> 20:21.637
Yeah we gotta get out of gangs

20:22.930 --> 20:24.932
But what’s Eduardo
gonna think about that?

20:55.045 --> 20:56.589
The revenge

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258
it's gonna kill me,

21:00.217 --> 21:02.219
but not today!

one of these choices boss

22:03.906 --> 22:05.282

23:58.479 --> 24:01.815
Third one is a charm!

24:03.942 --> 24:06.904
Are you going to tell me

25:09.967 --> 25:11.760
Hello

What are you looking for?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.249
So you wanna act like a man?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.042

26:56.865 --> 27:00.035
I’m not afraid of those mother fuckers I knock the shit out of them

27:03.580 --> 27:07.543
So we're independent contractors

27:09.628 --> 27:11.547

That's right.
No more sharing our haul with lazy-ass crime bosses

27:20.764 --> 27:24.726

27:33.652 --> 27:35.195
What about you?

27:36.363 --> 27:40.242
I’ve got 'bout five grand that’s
it

27:43.328 --> 27:45.455
Then we need a score

27:47.624 --> 27:48.667
A big score

27:48.917 --> 27:51.712
I’m done with this little
small time street shit

27:52.754 --> 27:54.756
I wanna go big!

27:55.883 --> 27:58.886
I wanna get out of LA go back to
Europe

27:59.553 --> 28:01.096
I miss Europe

28:01.096 --> 28:03.682
Europe's home. Ideas?

28:04.641 --> 28:06.643
A lot more dangerous

28:09.062 --> 28:10.355
What?

28:13.901 --> 28:17.195
The best people to rob...
criminals

28:18.405 --> 28:21.575
Robbing criminals's a lot easier

28:22.200 --> 28:24.328
it's not like they say,

28:24.328 --> 28:28.582
"Hey, Mr Police man, somebody
took my heroin shipment"

28:30.042 --> 28:32.544
Not exactly the healthiest thing
to do

28:33.045 --> 28:35.255
That’s right not healthy. But
you know what?

28:35.255 --> 28:37.257
It's the quickest way to
retirement

28:37.716 --> 28:39.718
If you got the balls

28:40.594 --> 28:43.931
I’m in. I'd rob the Devil
himself

28:43.931 --> 28:45.891
if I don't have to bow and
scrap

28:45.891 --> 28:48.018
to anybody
for the rest of my life

28:48.477 --> 28:49.561
Agreed

28:50.187 --> 28:52.940
Why not kill two birds with one
stone?

28:52.940 --> 28:54.024
How you mean?

28:54.775 --> 28:56.944
It's time to talke about
Raffaello

29:01.448 --> 29:02.157
Who?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.786
You heard his name same as I
did

29:07.496 --> 29:09.206
that night

29:10.082 --> 29:14.711
Don't even try to tell me
you haven't thought of that name

29:14.711 --> 29:16.421
every single day since

29:18.340 --> 29:19.925
And what if I did?

29:20.550 --> 29:25.097
Do you know he visited me right before I was sent to juvie?

29:27.099 --> 29:30.727
Didn't think I knew who he was

29:31.812 --> 29:33.063
but I did

29:33.689 --> 29:35.607
Mother Fucker Raffaello!

29:35.899 --> 29:37.859
He thinks he is a big shot

29:38.568 --> 29:42.489
international guy, big boss, LA
to Spain

29:43.991 --> 29:45.993
thinks he is untouchable

29:46.785 --> 29:49.246
yeah Raffaello he thinks he is
bullet proof

29:50.664 --> 29:53.458
Got all this cops in his pocket

29:53.834 --> 29:55.544
Bastard!

29:55.919 --> 29:58.880
Nobody even looks in his
direction

29:59.673 --> 30:02.592
Nobody mentions his name accept
for the cartels

30:03.010 --> 30:05.512
he's the big, biggest of the big

30:07.681 --> 30:09.683
Killed our parents,

30:09.933 --> 30:14.354
Klled your father because
he was standing in his way in LA

30:14.730 --> 30:19.651
and killed my padre because he was standing' in his way in Spain

30:21.862 --> 30:23.655
Raffaello is mine

30:25.115 --> 30:27.868
Fuck, he is mine

30:29.494 --> 30:31.038
I never forget

30:32.039 --> 30:34.166
Raffaello even bought my
parents' villa

30:35.625 --> 30:39.296
He lives in the very same place
he had them killed

30:40.756 --> 30:42.758
Probably he got a discount,

30:43.050 --> 30:45.552
on account of all the blood
stains

30:48.555 --> 30:50.057
We need a blaster

30:53.727 --> 30:55.729
My uncle Indio

30:56.980 --> 30:57.814
My uncle

30:59.357 --> 31:02.235
he is a bad ass mother fucker!

31:19.377 --> 31:21.129
What are you looking for?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.423
Indio Aztec

31:23.715 --> 31:25.717
Guess what,
I don't know you

31:26.009 --> 31:28.428
And I don't know you!
But I know him what the fuck

31:30.514 --> 31:32.265
Who the fuck are you?

31:32.516 --> 31:35.185
Hey I'm Rico man.
I got I got your sombrina

31:35.185 --> 31:36.520
Your niece she is right here

31:39.898 --> 31:41.108
Uncle!

31:44.903 --> 31:46.905
He wanted to kill me man

31:47.572 --> 31:49.407
Why didn't ya say so?

31:49.407 --> 31:51.034
She always set me up tio

31:51.868 --> 31:53.870
Come on come on inside

31:55.872 --> 31:56.790
Thanks a lot

31:56.790 --> 31:58.125
Take that one too

32:01.169 --> 32:02.295
My angel

32:03.922 --> 32:05.924
He gets to call you Angel

32:06.424 --> 32:11.596
Thank you, tio. I had no idea
you were out until Rico told me

32:12.681 --> 32:15.934
Not jus' out mijita, I'm free!

32:17.018 --> 32:18.019
How?

32:18.311 --> 32:21.565
Listen' I've done a lot of
bad things in my life

32:22.566 --> 32:25.026
I guess you could've
called me a hitman

32:25.986 --> 32:31.491
People nickcnamed me Indio the Aztec because I was so vicious

32:32.075 --> 32:34.077
And the police officer know it
too

32:34.953 --> 32:36.955
They could never pin anything on
me

32:37.455 --> 32:39.416
so they framed me for murder

32:39.791 --> 32:40.876
Rat bastards

32:42.794 --> 32:46.298
I was in my cell for a long time,
sitting on deathrow

32:47.174 --> 32:50.552
thinking this is it

32:51.595 --> 32:54.514
This is what my story of my life
ends

32:56.016 --> 32:58.351
To pass the time, I would think
about

32:59.853 --> 33:02.564
what I'd do if I could do it all
over again

33:03.607 --> 33:12.199
The idea of a famous LA taceria
hit me like a bolt of lightning

33:12.824 --> 33:15.744
People go mad on deathrow

33:16.286 --> 33:18.288
People go mad in solitary

33:19.206 --> 33:22.834
My imaginary taceria
kept me from going insane

33:25.420 --> 33:28.006
A week before my execution,

33:28.673 --> 33:34.888
one of those Innocence programs re-examined
the DNA found at the murder scene

33:34.888 --> 33:38.516
and find out it wasn't mine
and there was the State's case

33:38.767 --> 33:40.310
That's incredible

33:41.228 --> 33:42.938
No, my little daughter

33:43.230 --> 33:44.564
that's redemption

33:44.856 --> 33:47.984
God saw my dream and he knew

33:49.945 --> 33:51.863
he wanna give me a pass

33:53.240 --> 33:57.035
Indio me and Pistolera
we got something going on

33:57.452 --> 33:59.663
We wanna know if you wanna be
part of it?

33:59.663 --> 34:00.288
What?

34:01.039 --> 34:03.917
We're plannin' on hitting
Raffaello

34:07.254 --> 34:09.255
Little daughter

34:10.590 --> 34:12.592
Revenge is a dark path

34:13.842 --> 34:17.472
The further you go,
the darker you get

34:18.889 --> 34:22.268
You think I haven't thought about settling the score with Raffaello

34:22.893 --> 34:24.896
for what he did to my sister

34:25.688 --> 34:27.023
to Antonio

34:27.732 --> 34:29.734
to your parents

34:30.568 --> 34:32.570
Why didn't you?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.739
What good would it do mijita?

34:34.739 --> 34:35.739
Wouldn't bring 'em back

34:36.324 --> 34:39.577
Lissen' to me, I dropped
a lot of bodies in my time

34:40.370 --> 34:42.371
I deserved to be on deathrow

34:43.081 --> 34:45.750
But since God smiled on me

34:49.170 --> 34:52.047
I don't wanna put frauds
on people's faces anymore

34:54.676 --> 34:56.678
I wanna put smiles

34:58.054 --> 34:59.889
and keep on there and not wipe
them off

35:00.307 --> 35:02.309
Taco business that good

35:02.684 --> 35:05.645
I got every kind of taco in here
known in mankind

35:05.645 --> 35:07.272
Even tofu taco

35:08.523 --> 35:10.191
Oh man that's too much

35:10.191 --> 35:13.111
I hate that fucking vegan they
drive me nuts

35:14.487 --> 35:18.742
The people trying to gentrify the
neighborhood they love come down here

35:19.618 --> 35:23.163
getting a taco... or two or a
dozen

35:24.998 --> 35:26.833
I'm happy for you, tio.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.252
I truly am

35:29.669 --> 35:31.046
Salut

35:34.841 --> 35:36.092
To tofu

36:10.293 --> 36:11.503
Hey

36:12.379 --> 36:14.381
Come down, come down

36:15.006 --> 36:15.882
Give me a cigarette

36:19.469 --> 36:20.929
Hi, Cherry

36:28.103 --> 36:30.313
You gotta stop being so jumpy

36:30.688 --> 36:32.941
Gonna get high blood pressure or
something

36:33.233 --> 36:35.235
Or something. You, what the fuck
is this?

36:35.902 --> 36:38.321
You didn't say nuttin'
'bout meetin' nobody else

36:38.321 --> 36:41.157
I don't meet with nobody I don't know.
I told you that, Pistolera

36:41.449 --> 36:42.450
Come down

36:42.742 --> 36:43.410
Who is this bitch

36:43.660 --> 36:45.328
Relax already, Cherry

36:45.578 --> 36:47.163
Dis is my cousin Rico

36:47.747 --> 36:49.207
Now you know him

36:49.207 --> 36:51.042
Rico... this is Cherry

36:51.668 --> 36:53.086
What kinda name is Rico?

36:53.503 --> 36:55.422
What kind of name is Cherry?

36:55.839 --> 36:58.675
My crack whore mom named me Terese I liked Cherry better

37:00.427 --> 37:03.555
Doesn't look like the apple falls far from the tree you got a characteristic

37:05.265 --> 37:06.891
I ain't no crackhead

37:07.267 --> 37:09.894
Oxy's my thing. And I got it
under control

37:10.437 --> 37:10.979
I see

37:11.354 --> 37:13.064
Speakin' of which... you got my
money?

37:13.440 --> 37:14.524
Depends

37:14.524 --> 37:15.859
On what? Depends?

37:16.109 --> 37:17.444
You got my intel?

37:18.403 --> 37:19.028
Got it.

37:19.279 --> 37:19.988
Is it all there?

37:19.988 --> 37:22.699
It's all there baby,
come down baby, come down

37:23.575 --> 37:24.325
Alright

37:24.325 --> 37:25.952
Your info any good?

37:26.202 --> 37:26.745
Yeah

37:28.455 --> 37:30.498
He's got a shipment going down

37:31.833 --> 37:33.001
Who is he?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.587
Who is he? You know who he is?

37:35.879 --> 37:36.629
You know?

37:37.464 --> 37:39.215
Yes I jus' wanna to hear it.

37:39.215 --> 37:39.591
Fine

37:40.467 --> 37:41.759
It 's Raffaello

37:42.010 --> 37:45.472
Reason he's never been busted in all the years he's been operating,

37:45.722 --> 37:47.765
is because of one simple rule he
has

37:47.765 --> 37:51.227
The money and the drugs are never in the same place at the same time

37:52.103 --> 37:53.772
What do you mean?

37:54.105 --> 37:56.858
A representative receives
the money on one end

37:56.858 --> 38:00.028
A representative hands off the drugs somewhere else in Spain

38:00.487 --> 38:01.237
Smart

38:01.237 --> 38:02.030
Of course it is

38:02.363 --> 38:06.034
How does he know someone wouldn't burn him on one end or the other?

38:06.326 --> 38:08.119
Cause he's Raffaello, duh

38:08.119 --> 38:10.246
Only know one guy
what double-crossed him

38:10.246 --> 38:12.081
And what happened to that guy

38:12.081 --> 38:15.126
became a near mythic cautionary tale for all the rest of us

38:22.342 --> 38:24.344
So who is that guy?

38:26.679 --> 38:29.682
This guy Jerry was his rep on one end to collect the money

38:30.141 --> 38:32.852
A high end lawyer,
condo on the beach and all that

38:33.353 --> 38:36.981
Only, what Raffaello didn't know was that Jerry had a gambling problem

38:37.273 --> 38:39.108
and debts he couldn't pay

38:39.651 --> 38:42.153
So Jerry has
one of his knucklehead buddies

38:42.529 --> 38:44.447
guy named Kev rob him

38:45.240 --> 38:46.574
How the fuck would he know that?

38:47.784 --> 38:49.786
He didn't. Not at first

38:50.119 --> 38:53.456
But Jerry, greedy bastard that he was,
double- crossed his buddy

38:53.832 --> 38:57.043
Gave Kev a third
when he had promised him half

38:57.752 --> 39:04.050
So lemme guess,
Kev ratted out Jerry to Raffaello looking for a reward

39:04.551 --> 39:06.553
Yeah, he weren't no Einstein

39:07.387 --> 39:09.597
So, not only does Kev not get a
reward

39:09.597 --> 39:11.599
but Raffaello makes an example
out of him

39:12.100 --> 39:16.104
Tortures the poor bastard
all to hell... then kills him

39:17.230 --> 39:19.732
But it's what Raffaello does
with the pieces of Kev

39:19.732 --> 39:21.776
that makes this story so
interesting

39:22.318 --> 39:23.444
Which is?

39:24.737 --> 39:27.740
As you may have guessed,
Jerry is in the wind at this point

39:27.740 --> 39:29.492
He took the money and vanished,

39:29.492 --> 39:34.330
hiding out in the most remote regions of
the four corners of the earth he could find

39:34.789 --> 39:39.335
But everywhere Jerry went,
Costa Rica, Portugal, Iceland,

39:39.669 --> 39:43.172
even Vietnam at one point
pieces of Kev would show up

39:43.840 --> 39:45.842
Whadaya mean pieces of Kev?

39:47.635 --> 39:52.432
Everywhere this schmuck Jerry went,
a package showed up on his doorstep

39:52.724 --> 39:54.726
Each package had a piece of Kev
in it

39:55.226 --> 39:59.314
An ear, an eyeball,
a testicle, a finger

39:59.731 --> 40:00.648
Shit!

40:01.316 --> 40:02.066
I know

40:03.484 --> 40:08.615
Finally, when Jerry had hid in every
single place he could even imagine hiding

40:08.615 --> 40:11.701
only to find a package
on his doorstep, Jerry gave up

40:12.118 --> 40:14.787
He moved back
to his condo in Barcelona

40:15.121 --> 40:16.664
Why the fuck would he do that?

40:17.624 --> 40:21.044
The knowledge that no matter where he went,
Raffaello would find him

40:21.044 --> 40:23.838
combined with the thought of
what Raffaello would do to him

40:24.130 --> 40:27.050
if he did that to poor ole' Kev,
made Jerry give up

40:27.759 --> 40:30.762
The anticipation of what Raffaello was going to do to him

40:31.012 --> 40:32.722
was more than Jerry could take

40:33.348 --> 40:35.141
So what finally happened?

40:36.476 --> 40:38.436
Jerry was home for two weeks

40:38.436 --> 40:41.022
and not a single package came.
But, by that point

40:41.356 --> 40:44.108
Jerry was a mental, emotional
and physical wreck

40:44.442 --> 40:47.654
He jus' wanted Raffaello to kill him and for it to be over

40:48.905 --> 40:50.365
That what happened?

40:51.783 --> 40:54.494
One night Raffaello
showed up alone at Jerry's

40:54.744 --> 40:56.079
with a fine bottle of brandy

40:56.329 --> 40:59.874
They drank and relived all the good times
they had before Jerry stole from him

41:00.416 --> 41:02.210
Then Raffaello left

41:02.210 --> 41:03.044
He left?

41:03.670 --> 41:06.089
He left, but the next day
cops showed up

41:06.422 --> 41:09.592
and arrested Jerry for possession of drugs with intent to sell

41:10.093 --> 41:14.055
Seems Raffaello had a large quantity of drugs planted in Jerry's house

41:15.682 --> 41:18.810
Raffaello used his influence
to get Jerry sent to a prison

41:19.102 --> 41:22.063
where Raffaello's boys there
make Jerry's life a living hell

41:22.605 --> 41:26.150
Everything from rape to some
real medieval sadistic shit

41:28.403 --> 41:31.739
And Jerry tries to commit
suicide

41:31.739 --> 41:36.119
But Raffaello's boys are always watching and they always saved him

41:36.119 --> 41:40.998
all so they can torture the poor bastard for the rest of his life

41:40.998 --> 41:42.166
He's still alive?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.543
Yeah he is still alive

41:44.377 --> 41:46.879
This Raffaello really holds a
grudge

41:47.880 --> 41:50.299
So, who's Raffaello's new guy?

41:53.010 --> 41:57.348
Big time bail bondsman.
Dante Troy. Got billboards up

41:58.099 --> 42:00.977
Yeah, I've seen
his signs every where

42:03.062 --> 42:04.772
Now give me my money

42:14.157 --> 42:17.827
And remember, you never talked
to me ok? Never!

42:17.827 --> 42:20.163
Yeah maybe on a date

42:20.788 --> 42:22.749
Fucking crazy bitch

42:22.749 --> 42:24.792
Can you trust the lil' junkie?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.003
Trust the junkie, how the fuck
do you trust the junkie?

42:27.003 --> 42:29.046
Have you ever met somebody
to trust a fucking,

42:29.046 --> 42:32.633
If she is a fucking snitch on him,
she is gonna be a fucking snitch on us

42:33.509 --> 42:35.511
Why you don't listen to your
cousin?

42:36.387 --> 42:38.389
You fucking listen to me
sometime

42:38.931 --> 42:40.433
Loca man

42:43.644 --> 42:47.565
Felix da cat.
Never gets old Dante

42:51.360 --> 42:53.321
Don't worry its all there

42:53.988 --> 42:58.326
Oh I'm not worried as a Matter-of-fact.
Worrying's for suckers

43:00.411 --> 43:01.662
Wooh... wait...

43:04.082 --> 43:06.167
What kinda half-assed
desperados are you?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.002
Do know whose money that is?

43:08.377 --> 43:09.879
Yeah. Ours

43:10.296 --> 43:12.507
Your security's is not so
secure ist it?

43:13.091 --> 43:16.093
But It doesn't have to be.
Only a maniac would steal from...

43:16.803 --> 43:20.598
Raffaello. We know who
it used to belong to

43:20.973 --> 43:22.725
Yeah It belongs to us now

43:23.309 --> 43:28.105
Now all we need to know is who deals for Raffaello on the other end?

43:28.397 --> 43:30.358
Fuck you! He'd cut my heart out
and feed it to me

43:30.817 --> 43:31.943
He ain't here

43:32.318 --> 43:33.444
Yeah. We are

43:34.320 --> 43:35.238
Tell us

43:36.906 --> 43:38.991
Sure. Sure

43:38.991 --> 43:40.660
Info won't help you anyway

43:40.993 --> 43:42.745
His name is Henry Gallardo

43:43.120 --> 43:46.457
I know of him, high level
lowlife

43:47.875 --> 43:50.461
Didn't know he was
connected to Raffaello

43:51.504 --> 43:53.089
Can I go now?

43:53.089 --> 43:54.966
Sure. Sure he can go

43:55.258 --> 43:56.926
I didn't see yer faces

44:00.263 --> 44:05.601
Oh darlin, the bandannas were
just for effect

44:06.060 --> 44:08.062
Saw it in a movie once

44:08.771 --> 44:11.315
We want you to see our faces

44:14.485 --> 44:16.612
You didn't fucking have to do
that

44:16.612 --> 44:19.365
Fucking piss of shit!
Look at you now

44:19.907 --> 44:21.367
Spent it fast

44:22.034 --> 44:24.871
You are not going to enjoy the fruits of your labor for very long

44:24.871 --> 44:27.039
I know. But I hate bail
bondsmen

44:27.039 --> 44:30.918
You are a lower...
praying on poor people when their hurt

44:31.377 --> 44:32.461
I'm just a businessman

44:32.712 --> 44:33.880
Yeah the same business for us

44:34.922 --> 44:36.507
This is personal

44:40.761 --> 44:42.430
Fucking hate bail bondsmen

44:42.680 --> 44:44.682
They are the worst on fucking
earth

44:44.974 --> 44:46.142
They should all die

44:47.894 --> 44:49.896
Hey that's get the fuck out of
here! Go

44:54.233 --> 44:56.068
Can you drive that fucking boat

44:56.068 --> 44:56.569
Fuck No

44:56.569 --> 44:58.112
God time to learn it! Go!

44:58.112 --> 44:59.280
Let's go

45:01.157 --> 45:03.534
Drive

45:03.534 --> 45:05.202
Quick, quick!

45:12.084 --> 45:13.127
Let's put the money in here.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.129
We gonna get in
Let's go

45:40.571 --> 45:42.573
You wear white socks?

45:47.536 --> 45:49.538
As long the money is dry

45:52.708 --> 45:55.169
and as long my cigar is dry
I'm alright

45:57.129 --> 45:58.422
Raffaello

46:00.257 --> 46:02.259
When he finds out what about
Dante,

46:03.594 --> 46:05.888
he is gonna know
someone's on his ass

46:07.390 --> 46:10.643
Fucking right. Raffaello can
lose sleep for once

46:11.268 --> 46:16.148
I'd love to see Raffaello's face when they tell 'em he was ripped off

46:17.358 --> 46:19.151
Dis is a lot of money in here

46:19.402 --> 46:21.404
But he is not gonna give a fuck
He's filthy rich

46:22.196 --> 46:23.531
Fucking right

46:38.254 --> 46:39.630
Your cigar sir

46:40.756 --> 46:42.299
Thank you Esther

46:53.561 --> 46:55.479
A man and a woman

46:56.647 --> 46:58.649
Throat and the stomach

47:01.694 --> 47:03.779
No this was more than just the
money!

47:08.576 --> 47:09.452
It's personal

47:09.910 --> 47:10.745
Personal?

47:12.455 --> 47:15.958
They didn't have to shoot Dante.
He was unarmed

47:16.417 --> 47:18.544
This was to get my attention

47:20.671 --> 47:22.673
This was to sent a message to me

47:24.884 --> 47:27.053
This was a revenge

47:27.595 --> 47:28.554
Against you?

47:29.055 --> 47:32.349
No against Vladimir Putin.
Of course agains me you dumb fuck

47:33.142 --> 47:35.144
I want you to dig into all our
men

47:35.936 --> 47:38.731
Find out if there is another white bread piece of shit still troubles

47:39.523 --> 47:40.941
against Jerry Van Buren

47:50.785 --> 47:53.204
Someone who wants to take me out

47:53.454 --> 47:57.458
hates me so much they are willing to die in the bargain

48:06.509 --> 48:09.095
This is a very dangerous puto
madre

48:15.976 --> 48:17.978
The old stomping ground

48:19.605 --> 48:20.981
Flamenco Show

48:21.690 --> 48:24.360
So how we want to get jobs here?

48:24.360 --> 48:25.778
We've got money.
I don't understand

48:26.112 --> 48:28.697
Yeah? And as soon as we start
flashin' it,

48:29.115 --> 48:31.700
Raffaello's people will be all
over us

48:32.284 --> 48:35.538
As it is, they'll be on to us
soon enough anyway

48:35.538 --> 48:37.123
What's the deal with this place?

48:38.541 --> 48:40.501
Raffaello's son owns it

48:41.377 --> 48:44.213
You didn't tell me Raffaello had a son.
Why didn't tell me before?

48:44.588 --> 48:48.134
It's not the type of place you could just apply without references

48:48.676 --> 48:51.053
But... I have an idea

48:52.513 --> 48:53.848
Better be good

49:17.246 --> 49:20.082
Keep an eye out for a pudgy guy

49:20.082 --> 49:25.671
Rodrigo was a chunky lil' kid
with a sweet tooth

49:30.301 --> 49:32.094
Who's the hunk at the bar?

49:33.012 --> 49:34.305
That's Rodrigo

49:34.972 --> 49:35.931
That's Rodrigo?

49:37.266 --> 49:38.893
It's like he joined the gym

49:40.769 --> 49:42.271
A couple of dark beers

49:42.271 --> 49:43.856
Coming right now

49:43.856 --> 49:46.400
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.257
So that's Raffaello son, sure?

50:11.383 --> 50:14.887
Remember when I said he visited me right before I was sent up to juvie

50:17.097 --> 50:19.099
He had his son with him

50:19.516 --> 50:22.311
Wasn't worried 'bout being' seen
with him around me

50:23.479 --> 50:27.149
I was a little kid,
a nobody he had orphaned

50:28.108 --> 50:31.612
who was getting ready to go in the system for the next six years

50:33.239 --> 50:35.241
He was so arrogant

50:35.991 --> 50:39.370
Never came out
and said he did my parents

50:41.247 --> 50:45.417
But the gleam in his eyes said
it all

50:46.627 --> 50:48.629
Sumbitch' what he did to kids

50:49.880 --> 50:52.549
to our parents
wanna fucken and through it out

50:59.807 --> 51:03.185
Probably he figured it was best
if no one knew he had a kid

51:05.896 --> 51:10.359
Took me a while to track him,
he has a different last name and all

51:11.068 --> 51:15.614
But it's true. He's Raffaello's
son

51:15.864 --> 51:21.787
He owns dis place laundering money
from his daddy's criminal enterprises.

51:28.752 --> 51:30.504
Any job for me?

51:30.796 --> 51:32.172
What can you do?

51:32.631 --> 51:33.674
Sing and dance

51:39.888 --> 51:43.225
Lady do you have any Flamenco clothe for me in the back?

51:43.642 --> 51:44.601
Oh yes.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.020
Thanks.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.481
Give me a minute

52:05.414 --> 52:06.832
Play me a chord

53:43.470 --> 53:45.472
She is always gotta handle it

54:21.258 --> 54:23.385
Give the fucking money.
Give me the money

54:23.635 --> 54:24.887
Calm, brother!

54:24.887 --> 54:24.928
I don't unterstand your shit

54:25.220 --> 54:26.472
I don't unterstand your shit

54:26.805 --> 54:28.390
Sure my friend,
jus' don't hurt anybody.

54:31.185 --> 54:32.936
This was a fucking
stupid mistake man

54:35.314 --> 54:37.858
You shouldn't do that.
I was just gonna smack you around

54:38.150 --> 54:40.152
But now I'm gonna have to kill
you

54:40.944 --> 54:42.237
You shouldn't do that my friend

54:42.237 --> 54:42.863
Why?

54:42.863 --> 54:44.281
My father's Raffaello

54:45.699 --> 54:48.827
Raffaello, you think my mother's
the Pope

54:49.786 --> 54:50.954
Sit your asses down

54:51.497 --> 54:53.081
What a puta

54:53.081 --> 54:54.208
I don't think so, honey

54:57.628 --> 55:00.172
What is a man without bullets

55:39.086 --> 55:39.920
Fuck

55:48.053 --> 55:51.181
I don't get it
You hired us to hit that place

55:54.560 --> 55:56.562
And I'm firing you

56:09.908 --> 56:11.785
No please I wanna thank you

56:12.452 --> 56:15.205
Thank us some other time.
Me and my cousin...

56:16.623 --> 56:17.749
Angel

56:18.000 --> 56:20.794
Me and my cousin Angel
we are little bit

56:21.503 --> 56:24.214
let's just say the cops
don't like us too much

56:25.173 --> 56:26.883
How can I pay you back?

56:27.718 --> 56:29.136
Do you have any jobs for us?

56:30.178 --> 56:32.180
Wait until to see my other place

56:36.268 --> 56:39.730

private audition

56:48.530 --> 56:50.282
What the hell is that?

56:50.824 --> 56:52.826
Revenge forplay

56:54.620 --> 56:56.622
What the fuck long is take

56:57.039 --> 56:59.041
45 minutes waiting for a fucking
steak!

57:00.167 --> 57:02.127
And there is no fucking
salad dressing, nothing!

57:03.295 --> 57:06.340
There is one night off and the whole place turns to shit

Some punks with guns

57:14.640 --> 57:15.641
Bull shit

57:15.641 --> 57:17.643

57:19.519 --> 57:24.316
Rodrigo I kept you from the fucking business your whole life ok

57:25.150 --> 57:28.654
I didn't give you my name to
protect you

57:30.113 --> 57:35.035

Your days when I was young

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.221
Now everyone's a fucking whore

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.055

trying to keep things quiet

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.792

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:49.219
They say that your life flashes
right before you before you die

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.013
Stop talkin' like that

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.223
I believe it

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.934
Shit, it's on fire

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:56.976

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:57.977
Get out its gonna blow

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:02.232
I rather be on shot

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.610
Come and take me mother fucker

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:15.954

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:22.710
Indio!

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.267
Tio, what about the taco
business?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.228
Oh yeah I got a couple of homeboys watching the place for me

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.148
Figured you guys might need some
help

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.567
My father had one like this

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.487
Who do you think
taught him how to use it?

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:51.781
Watch out!

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.160
Good night get the fuck off

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.170
You gotta go to a doctor

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.213
I don't need a doctor
it's a flash wound

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.465
Hey, you are not a hero

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.261
I think I heard that somewhere
before

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.556
What the fuck
let's just go back to the car

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.266

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.688
I need a fucking whiskey

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:30.195
Why Raffaello
never came after you, Indio?

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.947
Even when I was on deathrow

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.241
I was still under the protection
of the cartel

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.913
Raffaello managed to get
a message to me anyway

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.414
through guard

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.791
You guys would be dead

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:44.876
What a bastard

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:49.464
Shit, Chingao

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.219
I don't even get a whiskey
with that shit

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.725
Who would known that hair salon lady is so good at this shit?

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.019
Draya's a registered nurse

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.980
She don't look like no nurse to
me

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.941
Don't judge no book by its cover

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.401
I guess I could get mine

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:11.611

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.517
I will never leave you

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.937
Just wanted to smoke a cigarette

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.289

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.749
But I ain't never figured you

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.419
Ain't like that, Pistolera

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.338
Ain't like that!

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.301
Was it worth it?

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.136
Make it quick, please.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.060
What is that?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.354
What is that?

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.356
She's my little girl

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.484
Don't kill her, please, don't
kill her

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.069

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.491
Please don't kill her

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.327
Please, please

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:44.245
Please

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.149
This is for you, papa

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.113
Can you do your father a favor?

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.656
Yes, papa

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:25.536
Can you put on a fine dress and make-up to show
my guests what a beautiful young lady you are?

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:27.747
Yes, papa

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.131
Papa? Papa?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:43.095
My little rose, I wish you have
a happy life

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:46.474
A life different from mine

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.268
Bastards!

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.491
Raffaello Vasques

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:12.834
My dear, you don't need me
anymore

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:17.422
No, my dear, the next dance
is a private dance

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.967
I have all my music on a CD

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.344
Can you play it for me?

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:24.387
Of course

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.681
Good night

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:27.598
Good night

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.152
The revenge

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.823
The revenge

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:25.031
I can watch my Angel dance all
night

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.249
Hey I don't need that nanny's

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.543
Your father said you need protection,
you getting protection!

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:00.793
It's part of the show

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.339
It's showtime

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.387
Some men never learn

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.813
I think that looks like a
perfect ten

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.106
What do you think, Indio?

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.276
Hey leave something for me, you
taken job

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:28.446
What is this?

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:32.325
You know what I don't know
what they call this in Spain

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:37.288
But it you would be in LA,
we call this a kidnapping

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:18.120
Martin what is it?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.080
Where are you?

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.081
I'm with the two boys

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.457
Take the bitch out

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.584
Right, I'm on it

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.086
Take the bitch out!

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:27.213
Don't worry, she won't be
a problem anymore

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.766
Your father killed my family

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:44.480
I should take your life

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.193
But I got a Corazon

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:54.365

hand

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.178
Hey, shitass!

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.358
Remember me bitch?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.361

Spain

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:16.781

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.966
And now little boy?

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.810
You should have stayed at home

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:46.811
I don't think so

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:53.234
Come on Puto! Are you tired?

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.838
