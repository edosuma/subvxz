02:07.010 --> 02:11.371
Welcome to the Daytona 500, the Superbowl of motor racing.

02:11.531 --> 02:17.131
Walking onto the grid is two-time champion Rowdy Burns.

02:17.332 --> 02:23.572
A contender from Pennsylvania, Aldo Bennedetti.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

02:39.774 --> 02:42.975
Gentlemen, start your engines.

03:23.539 --> 03:29.060
Number 43, Richard Petty, spins to the inside of the track.

03:31.581 --> 03:33.700
Richard Petty is out of the Daytona 500.

03:33.901 --> 03:37.661
Speaking of people out of the race, remember Harry Hogge?

03:37.821 --> 03:44.221
His driver, Buddy Bretherton, died here last year in a fiery crash.

03:47.342 --> 03:50.223
- You're enjoying the good life.
- Yeah.

03:50.422 --> 03:54.343
I never minded spreading a little fertilizer around now and then.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.863
- How's the truck running?
- Good.

03:58.023 --> 04:02.544
I want you to build me a car.

04:07.225 --> 04:11.985
Everybody knows some car dealer who can't afford a race team.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.745
No driver will sign with you.

04:14.905 --> 04:19.345
If they wreck one car, you can't afford to build them another.

04:19.546 --> 04:23.746
No car's going to win without a driver... not even mine.

04:23.906 --> 04:27.107
If you built the car, I'd get a damn driver.

04:30.907 --> 04:37.748
What kind of driver are you going to find after the season's started?

04:37.948 --> 04:39.459
You can work with him.

04:39.484 --> 04:42.572
You can build a driver like you build a car.

04:42.708 --> 04:46.829
That hound is the best coon dog I've ever seen.

04:46.989 --> 04:49.289
And I didn't teach him a thing.

04:49.314 --> 04:51.093
I've got somebody.

04:51.229 --> 04:52.628
Take a look at him.

04:52.653 --> 04:55.374
He doesn't sound like somebody.

04:55.549 --> 04:59.550
Then take a look at nobody.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.090
Tim, I gave up racing.

05:02.115 --> 05:05.575
You didn't give up racing.

05:05.751 --> 05:12.431
You quit to avoid an investigation into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

05:13.752 --> 05:15.044
I talked to NASCAR.

05:15.069 --> 05:18.536
If you come back there won't be an investigation.

05:18.673 --> 05:20.176
How did you sell them that deal?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.656
I'm a hell of a salesman.

05:27.474 --> 05:30.673
Now that's a race car driver.

05:31.794 --> 05:35.234
When's your driver due?

05:37.875 --> 05:40.261
Your guy runs those Indy types.

05:40.286 --> 05:41.979
Sprints, mainly.

05:42.115 --> 05:48.635
Two championships, three all-star wins, seven straight feature wins.

05:50.436 --> 05:52.294
He's a real statistician.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.140
Does he know anything about drivers?

06:00.517 --> 06:03.470
Harry, where's your driver from?

06:03.495 --> 06:05.062
Eagle Rock.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.770
Is that up around Wilkesboro?

06:07.794 --> 06:10.542
No. Glendale, California.

06:10.679 --> 06:12.021
He's a Yankee?

06:12.045 --> 06:15.303
Californians aren't Yankees.

06:15.439 --> 06:18.434
They're not really anything.

06:18.459 --> 06:20.383
You said it.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.278
The shocks are right, we're dialed in.

06:37.303 --> 06:38.946
Don't change a thing.

06:41.002 --> 06:43.950
Hey, you're looking pretty good.

06:43.975 --> 06:47.106
You're the one looking good.

06:47.242 --> 06:52.083
It hasn't been easy, Harry, but this bitch is ready to run.

06:52.243 --> 06:57.164
We appreciate you letting us use the car, Rowdy.

06:58.204 --> 06:59.156
I told you.

06:59.181 --> 07:02.989
Harry's got a new driver and he needs a car for a few laps.

07:03.164 --> 07:06.845
Harry Hogge asked us personally as a favor.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.286
Who is this driver?

07:43.850 --> 07:48.610
Tim tells me you've been running open wheels.

07:48.809 --> 07:53.250
Now you just want to up and drive NASCAR?

07:53.451 --> 07:55.663
This is stock car racing.

07:55.688 --> 07:58.875
I've watched it on television.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.677
You've seen it on television?

08:01.702 --> 08:05.195
ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

08:05.332 --> 08:10.172
This may not be the best time for you to run this car.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.144
Is there some problem?

08:13.169 --> 08:14.957
No, sir.

08:15.132 --> 08:19.493
You bend this bitch, and I'll tear your balls off.

08:28.815 --> 08:33.015
Would you mind very much holding on to this?

08:33.174 --> 08:37.015
Didn't you hear what that man said?

08:39.096 --> 08:42.075
Hold on, we ought to talk.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.881
About how I'm going to run?

08:46.016 --> 08:49.201
About how you've managed to live so long.

08:49.226 --> 08:51.401
You ain't racing this car.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.717
What's going on?

09:00.742 --> 09:03.602
You said you'd look at him.

09:03.738 --> 09:04.992
I've looked at him.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.523
I paid $2,500 to use this track.

09:07.659 --> 09:10.639
Forget it. He needs a brand name.

09:10.664 --> 09:14.004
I know a driver when I see one.

09:15.259 --> 09:18.395
Harry, is this happening or what?

09:18.420 --> 09:21.364
Do us all a favor, Harry.

09:27.581 --> 09:28.948
Let me drive.

09:28.973 --> 09:32.445
I won't make a fool out of you.

09:39.142 --> 09:41.460
That tunnel turn is real tricky.

09:41.485 --> 09:43.366
Hot or cold, it's slick.

09:43.543 --> 09:47.282
You'll slam into the wall before you know it.

09:47.307 --> 09:48.688
So take it easy.

09:58.984 --> 10:01.225
I'm dropping the hammer.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.209
No, you're not.

10:34.629 --> 10:36.348
it's under Rowdy's time.

10:36.373 --> 10:39.093
He should've cracked up the car.

10:53.991 --> 10:57.272
- That was fast.
- Yeah?

10:57.471 --> 10:58.472
31 flat.

10:58.497 --> 11:02.496
That's good enough to take the pole in the last race here.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.349
You never drove a stock car?

11:08.374 --> 11:10.977
No, sprints mainly.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.699
Buck Bretherton.

11:12.724 --> 11:16.297
Cole Trickle, nice to meet you.

11:16.434 --> 11:20.794
You were one lucky son of a bitch in the tunnel turn.

11:20.954 --> 11:24.555
If you think it was luck, let's do it again.

11:24.754 --> 11:26.715
You run good.

11:26.914 --> 11:31.276
Go get your own car and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

11:32.995 --> 11:35.890
What's wrong with open wheels?

11:35.915 --> 11:37.940
I lost my ride.

11:38.076 --> 11:42.117
After all those wins, you were fired?

11:42.276 --> 11:43.691
I lost my ride.

11:43.716 --> 11:46.144
I'd have quit regardless.

11:46.169 --> 11:48.621
I wasn't going anywhere.

11:48.797 --> 11:50.896
Where do you want to go?

11:50.921 --> 11:52.582
Indianapolis.

11:52.758 --> 11:58.039
To win in Indy I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same.

11:58.198 --> 12:01.799
There's nothing stock about a stock car.

12:01.999 --> 12:06.999
I'm not trying to insult you, but stock cars are built to run equal.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.850
I won't be beaten by a car.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.985
Only by a driver.

12:15.441 --> 12:18.800
You build me a car, and I'll win Daytona next year.

12:23.802 --> 12:28.322
I'm going to give you an engine low to the ground.

12:28.482 --> 12:32.603
An extra-big oil pan that'll cut the wind underneath you.

12:32.762 --> 12:37.883
That'll give you 30-40 more horsepower.

12:38.043 --> 12:43.124
I'll give you a fuel line that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

12:43.284 --> 12:47.244
I'll shave half an inch off you and shape you like a bullet.

12:47.404 --> 12:51.284
When I get you primed, painted and weighed...

12:51.444 --> 12:58.005
you're going to be ready to go out on that racetrack.

12:58.165 --> 13:01.445
You're going to be perfect.

14:09.734 --> 14:12.694
I'm going to pull this rookie's chain.

14:17.454 --> 14:19.705
Cole, you're all over the track.

14:19.730 --> 14:21.839
He just slammed into me.

14:22.015 --> 14:24.646
He didn't slam you or bump you.

14:24.671 --> 14:27.639
He rubbed you. Rubbing is racing.

14:35.617 --> 14:39.137
There goes the fender.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.737
There goes the quarter panel.

15:10.700 --> 15:16.381
While we're still under a caution, go out and hit the pace car.

15:16.581 --> 15:20.541
Hit the pace car? What for?

15:20.701 --> 15:24.464
You hit every other damn thing out there.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.967
I want you to be perfect.

15:41.744 --> 15:43.705
You're too high.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.192
How about that?

16:05.217 --> 16:07.691
This side we don't have to fix.

16:10.907 --> 16:14.187
I don't want you spoiled, Buck.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.630
This is gonna hurt.

16:36.310 --> 16:38.951
Did you see that guy?

16:50.792 --> 16:52.431
I've got to pit.

16:52.456 --> 16:55.017
No, we're busy now.

16:55.153 --> 16:57.488
We're eating ice cream.

16:57.513 --> 16:59.137
Ice cream!

17:09.914 --> 17:14.513
You can come in and get one, but it wouldn't impress NASCAR.

17:14.714 --> 17:19.395
You have enough trouble riding around the track as it is.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.917
Take it easy.

17:35.117 --> 17:38.157
Come on now, Cole!

17:45.878 --> 17:48.601
We messed up big-time on Sunday.

17:48.626 --> 17:51.263
I had sponsors in the stands.

17:51.399 --> 17:57.079
I was hugging and holding hands and praying for a good showing.

17:57.240 --> 18:02.080
And we end up looking like a monkey fucking a football.

18:04.360 --> 18:10.041
Everybody out, please... except you two.

18:17.162 --> 18:22.842
I've got a question: What is the one thing you need to do to win a race?

18:23.043 --> 18:24.606
it's pretty obvious...

18:24.631 --> 18:27.187
- Quiet! You must finish the race.

18:27.323 --> 18:31.604
I realize that Harry's been around a long time.

18:31.803 --> 18:36.244
But I need a proper car that doesn't blow engines.

18:36.404 --> 18:40.485
If he didn't over-rev the engine, it wouldn't blow.

18:40.645 --> 18:43.485
When you shift the gear,

18:43.645 --> 18:50.126
and the needle on the tach reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

18:51.846 --> 18:54.244
The tires blow, is that my fault?

18:54.269 --> 18:56.230
Yes, it's your fault.

18:56.366 --> 18:59.807
There's 40 other drivers out there who don't use up their tires.

19:00.006 --> 19:04.287
There's nothing I can't do with a race car.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.518
There's only so much I can do!

19:06.543 --> 19:07.992
That's obvious.

19:08.127 --> 19:11.648
He doesn't need to appreciate your job to do his.

19:11.848 --> 19:15.808
He has to know what a car can and can't do!

19:15.968 --> 19:20.729
You want me to work the pit and you drive?

19:22.049 --> 19:25.330
I can't talk to this son of a bitch.

19:27.010 --> 19:29.917
I can't talk to that son of a bitch.

19:29.942 --> 19:31.314
I really can't.

19:35.371 --> 19:37.079
You think he can drive?

19:37.104 --> 19:38.515
He can drive.

19:38.692 --> 19:41.972
He can drive beyond the limits of the car!

19:42.131 --> 19:45.252
If he'd listen to me, we'd never lose a race.

19:47.733 --> 19:52.813
If we don't get a sponsor soon, my ass is fried.

19:55.813 --> 19:59.334
I'm liable to be out of the car business all together.

19:59.494 --> 20:01.675
Harry, I know you're great.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.638
You know you're great.

20:03.774 --> 20:08.535
But if the driver doesn't trust you, we're never going to win a race.

20:20.976 --> 20:24.016
Hey, Harry.

20:27.697 --> 20:30.055
We've got to talk.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.961
All right, talk.

20:33.098 --> 20:36.058
On the radio during the race...

20:36.258 --> 20:41.099
You've got to tell us what's going on with the car.

20:41.298 --> 20:44.099
You want to change the way I drive.

20:44.258 --> 20:47.459
Set up the car so I don't have to change.

20:47.619 --> 20:48.646
Tell me how.

20:48.671 --> 20:51.323
What do you want to know?

20:51.460 --> 20:54.419
Is she running loose or tight?

20:54.620 --> 20:59.220
A turn here, take some wedge out, we'll win some races.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.876
I can't do that.

21:00.900 --> 21:05.445
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

21:05.581 --> 21:08.942
How do you mean that?

21:15.582 --> 21:18.456
I don't know much about cars.

21:18.481 --> 21:22.047
Neither does any other driver.

21:22.183 --> 21:23.940
No, I really don't know.

21:23.965 --> 21:24.909
A turn here?

21:24.934 --> 21:26.112
A wedge there?

21:26.224 --> 21:27.442
I don't know.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.528
How can that be?

21:29.664 --> 21:33.785
They told me to get in a car and drive.

21:34.904 --> 21:38.220
I'd like to help out, but I can't.

21:38.245 --> 21:41.169
I don't have the vocabulary.

21:45.106 --> 21:52.186
Well... we're just going to have to figure one out.

21:54.867 --> 21:57.947
Don't worry about it.

21:57.972 --> 21:59.731
All right?

22:01.188 --> 22:04.468
How does she feel?

22:04.668 --> 22:07.979
Her ass is all over the place.

22:08.004 --> 22:11.093
Her rear end is loose.

22:11.229 --> 22:15.269
"Loose" is fast, and "on the edge" is out of control.

22:18.269 --> 22:22.630
Cole, there is something else.

22:22.830 --> 22:25.404
Tires is what wins a race.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.694
What are you talking about?

22:28.831 --> 22:33.951
If you can't run without melting the tires, we can't finish a race.

22:34.112 --> 22:37.392
What do you want?

22:37.552 --> 22:41.673
Run 50 laps any way you like, then 50 laps like I want you to.

22:41.872 --> 22:43.866
Give me an honest run.

22:43.891 --> 22:46.337
If you do, I'll beat you.

23:00.074 --> 23:03.915
Now we're going to do it 50 laps my way.

23:04.075 --> 23:08.595
When you were racing Indy cars, the tires were twice as wide,

23:08.755 --> 23:11.951
and the car weighed half as much.

23:11.976 --> 23:14.300
Now it's the opposite.

23:14.476 --> 23:19.397
You're burning them up. They melt and get greasy.

23:19.556 --> 23:25.077
You slip and slide and you're out of control. Let's go!

23:39.438 --> 23:40.882
His way, my way.

23:40.907 --> 23:43.343
I was six seconds faster.

23:43.479 --> 23:47.520
You can buy me some lunch at the highway joint.

24:01.681 --> 24:02.658
What's wrong?

24:02.682 --> 24:05.386
We're figuring out what to do.

24:06.642 --> 24:07.626
About what?

24:07.651 --> 24:09.706
We're in trouble.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.237
Rowdy took the pole in 30:25.

24:12.262 --> 24:15.266
We're almost a second off the pace.

24:15.403 --> 24:19.083
We're looking for some speed.

24:20.284 --> 24:23.724
The car's perfect, Harry.

24:32.725 --> 24:38.806
it's the first race of the season at Darlington International Speedway.

24:38.966 --> 24:41.788
You're running 12th.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.070
30 laps to go.

24:55.848 --> 24:58.638
You're going to burn the tires.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.633
Everybody else slowed down.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.108
He's right. Check his lap times.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.473
Everybody else has fallen off.

25:06.609 --> 25:09.297
You're doing good, Cole.

25:09.322 --> 25:12.793
You're gaining on the leader.

25:16.570 --> 25:19.170
15 to go.

25:21.291 --> 25:24.091
Don't pass on the outside of turn four.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.664
Stay to the inside.

25:27.689 --> 25:29.275
Ten laps to go.

25:32.892 --> 25:36.252
Trickle is right behind Rowdy Burns.

25:36.453 --> 25:39.253
I'm right behind the leader.

25:39.277 --> 25:41.477
Five laps to go.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.458
Remember me?

25:44.483 --> 25:47.077
What the hell's going on?

25:47.214 --> 25:48.845
Just a little rubbing.

25:48.870 --> 25:50.278
Rubbing's racing.

25:56.214 --> 25:59.655
I'm going to take this rookie once and for all.

26:03.535 --> 26:04.860
That's enough!

26:04.885 --> 26:08.480
You can't play with Rowdy like this.

26:08.656 --> 26:11.096
Relax, Harry.

26:13.256 --> 26:16.537
Rowdy Burns is out!

26:16.737 --> 26:21.018
No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.

26:21.177 --> 26:23.406
We have a new leader.

26:23.431 --> 26:26.402
Cole Trickle in number 46.

26:26.538 --> 26:29.818
We're under caution with three laps to go.

26:29.978 --> 26:30.759
Come on in.

26:30.784 --> 26:33.123
What for? it's almost over.

26:33.299 --> 26:34.648
You've done 68 laps.

26:34.673 --> 26:36.763
Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.501
Go, go!

26:49.661 --> 26:53.662
The air gun's jammed, get me another one.

26:56.822 --> 27:00.102
Let's go!

27:04.142 --> 27:06.103
Damn it! Go! Go!

27:06.263 --> 27:09.103
Get them on quick!

27:16.984 --> 27:19.221
Son of a bitch!

27:19.246 --> 27:21.929
Now, Cole...

27:26.305 --> 27:27.236
Son of a bitch!

27:27.261 --> 27:29.370
We're on the air, all right?

27:29.545 --> 27:30.988
I was in first place.

27:31.013 --> 27:33.690
Now I'm in third with two laps to go.

27:33.866 --> 27:35.653
Don't get excited.

27:35.678 --> 27:39.250
Third place is pretty respectable.

27:39.386 --> 27:44.547
Going into turn four, drive right by him on the outside.

27:44.707 --> 27:48.067
Nobody goes to the outside on turn four.

27:48.268 --> 27:50.084
You can hold it.

27:50.108 --> 27:54.532
He's going to end up in the wall.

27:54.709 --> 27:57.332
The pace car is about to go off.

27:57.357 --> 27:59.733
We don't have time to talk.

27:59.869 --> 28:02.869
We've got a good set of tires on.

28:02.894 --> 28:03.893
What?

28:04.030 --> 28:05.903
Those tires are matched perfect.

28:05.928 --> 28:08.093
You're going to get him killed.

28:08.230 --> 28:13.391
If you go to the outside, you can hold it.

28:13.550 --> 28:15.671
All right.

28:23.352 --> 28:25.598
The white flag is out.

28:25.623 --> 28:27.256
One lap to go.

28:42.994 --> 28:46.594
The boy don't have the balls to pass me on the outside.

28:46.754 --> 28:50.955
They're heading into treacherous turn four.

29:15.037 --> 29:18.998
Cole Trickle wins his first ever NASCAR victory.

29:19.158 --> 29:23.118
Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.

29:31.440 --> 29:37.200
On that last turn, did you know you could make the car stick like that?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.653
I knew it all along.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.945
Harry put on special tires.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.565
What's special about them?

29:45.590 --> 29:48.265
Nothing in particular.

29:50.082 --> 29:51.280
You told me...

29:51.305 --> 29:53.786
I had to calm you down.

29:53.962 --> 29:58.323
You were acting like such a candy-ass when the air gun stuck.

30:03.443 --> 30:05.203
Try this on for size.

30:05.228 --> 30:07.908

30:26.406 --> 30:32.487
Selling useless mining stock is called a dog and pony show.

30:32.646 --> 30:38.487
It may be funny, but it's not that funny when it happens to you.

30:38.687 --> 30:40.593
It happened to me.

30:40.618 --> 30:44.112
You bought worthless stock?

30:44.248 --> 30:46.561
I told you I lost my ride.

30:46.586 --> 30:48.632
That's how I lost it.

30:48.808 --> 30:53.249
Team owner was a conman selling junk bonds.

30:53.409 --> 30:56.849
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

30:57.009 --> 31:00.609
After I won, he used my name to promote the sales.

31:00.769 --> 31:05.131
He went to jail and I lost my ride.

31:06.810 --> 31:09.101
It was pretty humiliating.

31:09.126 --> 31:12.035
Hell, don't be embarrassed.

31:12.171 --> 31:16.612
Some lowlife piece of trash put you in a bad position.

31:16.811 --> 31:23.812
That depends on whether you're related to that piece of trash.

31:24.892 --> 31:28.013
He was my father.

31:28.173 --> 31:32.613
I've never really stuck with anything since.

31:32.773 --> 31:38.534
They don't trust me, and I don't trust them.

31:38.694 --> 31:42.054
Like for instance...

31:42.214 --> 31:43.777
You lied to me today.

31:43.802 --> 31:46.999
It was dumb-luck I didn't end up crashed.

31:47.135 --> 31:49.547
I ought to punch you out.

31:49.572 --> 31:52.079
Yeah? Give it a try.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.856
No.

31:58.016 --> 32:02.776
I wouldn't want my ass kicked by a 60-year-old man.

32:02.977 --> 32:05.257
59.

32:17.858 --> 32:22.780
Drivers just don't go to the outside like that.

32:22.939 --> 32:25.573
I knew you could do it.

32:25.597 --> 32:28.804
I believed it in my heart.

32:32.860 --> 32:35.661
- Peach or cherry?
- Cherry.

32:38.981 --> 32:42.341
I need a leak.

32:42.541 --> 32:46.902
There's calculating drivers, and then there's kamikaze drivers.

32:47.062 --> 32:51.304
Cole here's a kamikaze, like my pappy was.

32:51.329 --> 32:53.247
Buddy Bretherton.

32:53.422 --> 32:57.783
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

32:57.983 --> 32:59.981
He died at Daytona.

33:00.006 --> 33:01.687
Last year.

33:01.864 --> 33:03.448
How did it happen?

33:03.473 --> 33:05.408
He hit the wall.

33:05.544 --> 33:08.259
He was probably dead before that.

33:08.284 --> 33:11.408
The coroner reported a heart attack.

33:25.706 --> 33:28.666
We've been pulled over.

33:32.227 --> 33:35.926
Everybody out and up against the wall.

33:35.951 --> 33:38.092
You're under arrest.

33:39.348 --> 33:42.068
- What the hell for?
- That.

33:42.228 --> 33:46.748
Transportation of alcohol for the purpose of distribution.

33:46.908 --> 33:50.909
This is not distribution, this is consumption.

33:51.069 --> 33:54.552
That doesn't make it legal.

33:54.577 --> 33:57.414
Up against the wall.

34:08.831 --> 34:11.786
It looks like we've found something.

34:11.812 --> 34:13.534
A concealed weapon.

34:13.712 --> 34:14.766
Where?

34:14.791 --> 34:17.775
Right here.

34:23.473 --> 34:27.233
Now, the only question is:

34:31.514 --> 34:34.875
Will he actually use it?

34:46.516 --> 34:47.530
Don't be mad.

34:47.554 --> 34:51.219
Harry and the boys thought you might like me.

34:58.277 --> 35:02.718
Here we are for summer speed week in Daytona Beach, Florida.

35:02.917 --> 35:08.198
The favorite today is newcomer Cole Trickle in number 46.

35:08.358 --> 35:13.799
He has won an unprecedented five out of his last six races.

35:29.640 --> 35:34.001
Stop playing peek-a-boo in Rowdy's rear-view mirror.

35:38.721 --> 35:41.005
I'm not doing anything like that.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.106
Then what are you doing?

35:45.923 --> 35:47.542
I loosened his bumper.

35:47.567 --> 35:49.627
I'll have to break it off.

35:49.802 --> 35:53.683
If his bumper goes through your radiator, you're finished.

35:55.443 --> 35:59.364
Rowdy, let him go by.

36:01.724 --> 36:05.164
I'm going to take him on the high side.

36:23.087 --> 36:26.989
What are you worried about, Harry?

36:27.014 --> 36:30.112
Great recovery, Cole.

36:37.769 --> 36:42.529
Trickle's right behind the number 51 car, and they'll go at it again.

36:52.450 --> 36:56.490
There's a crash coming out of turn four.

37:00.091 --> 37:02.131
I see it.

37:32.055 --> 37:34.061
I can't see anything.

37:34.086 --> 37:37.239
Wiggle your fingers for me.

37:37.375 --> 37:40.815
I can't see anything.

37:40.976 --> 37:44.016
I'm all right.

37:50.457 --> 37:52.271
I don't need recharging.

37:52.296 --> 37:54.561
It's standard procedure.

37:54.697 --> 37:56.374
You go screw yourself.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.922
What was that?

37:58.097 --> 38:01.057
I wouldn't tell you to do that.

38:08.498 --> 38:10.603
Tell me what's going on.

38:10.628 --> 38:12.643
What's your name?

38:12.819 --> 38:14.100
Cole.

38:14.125 --> 38:19.244
Cole, lie still, please.

38:20.620 --> 38:22.710
CAT scan, right away.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.525
Yes, Doctor.

38:31.981 --> 38:33.321
He's had a concussion.

38:33.346 --> 38:36.206
His brain is bruised and it's going to swell.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.422
That's what's affecting his vision.

38:39.622 --> 38:42.502
You have a concussion.

38:42.662 --> 38:44.845
It will affect your vision.

38:44.869 --> 38:46.647
Will it go away?

38:46.783 --> 38:50.623
Tell him we're running some tests.

38:50.784 --> 38:53.235
What did his helmet look like?

38:53.260 --> 38:54.648
Was it cracked?

38:54.784 --> 38:55.560
No.

38:55.585 --> 38:58.688
Was it scratched?

39:00.305 --> 39:03.985
Was the helmet scratched at the front or back?

39:04.145 --> 39:06.215
The back and the front.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.849
Are you a brain doctor?

39:08.985 --> 39:12.946
Could someone talk to me?

39:14.587 --> 39:20.267
When I'm driving, I've got a guy on the radio who talks to me.

39:22.907 --> 39:28.228
Don't worry, we're going to take care of him.

39:54.911 --> 39:56.951
Harry.

39:57.112 --> 39:59.157
Are you okay, Harry?

39:59.182 --> 40:00.816
Yeah. Why?

40:04.032 --> 40:08.473
You look all bent out of shape.

40:11.273 --> 40:14.029
Hell, it's probably just my eyes.

40:14.054 --> 40:16.978
No, I've been here all night.

40:17.153 --> 40:21.074
Jesus! What are they giving me here?

40:21.234 --> 40:24.675
What happened?

40:24.874 --> 40:29.635
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

40:29.795 --> 40:33.836
The rule is, go straight for them.

40:34.035 --> 40:38.236
So I never took my foot off the gas.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.953
He should have been gone by the time I got there...

40:42.978 --> 40:44.541
..but he wasn't.

40:44.717 --> 40:50.957
I think another car hit you and knocked you into Rowdy.

40:52.957 --> 40:56.111
It's one of those things that never happens.

40:56.136 --> 40:58.142
Don't even think about it.

41:01.519 --> 41:03.591
I'll get the doctor.

41:03.616 --> 41:05.583
I feel great.

41:23.161 --> 41:26.762
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

41:28.962 --> 41:32.843
It's damn nice to see you, Buck.

41:35.163 --> 41:38.443
Cole, you've met Dr Lewicki.

41:42.283 --> 41:43.463
That's your doctor.

41:43.488 --> 41:45.908
He's not actually seen me before.

41:46.084 --> 41:48.524
Sure, Harry.

41:49.484 --> 41:53.005
- No...
- Dr Lewicki.

41:53.204 --> 41:55.252
Smock, stethoscope.

41:55.277 --> 41:58.509
It's a great costume, Harry.

41:58.645 --> 41:59.867
How are you, Doc?

41:59.892 --> 42:02.190
This really is Dr Lewicki.

42:02.326 --> 42:04.964
I was just about to go off duty.

42:04.988 --> 42:07.790
You came by to look me over.

42:07.967 --> 42:09.855
That's not a bad idea.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.111
Is your vision restored?

42:12.287 --> 42:13.443
I think so.

42:13.468 --> 42:15.991
Nothing's blurred?

42:16.167 --> 42:18.748
No haloes around objects?

42:18.773 --> 42:20.631
Flashing lights?

42:20.767 --> 42:23.235
What are you going to do now?

42:23.260 --> 42:25.472
Look into your eyes.

42:25.649 --> 42:28.448
Doc...

42:30.289 --> 42:34.809
Isn't this what you're really looking for?

42:36.409 --> 42:40.770
That's interesting enough, but it's just not my specialty.

42:52.652 --> 42:54.759
She was the real thing?

42:54.784 --> 42:58.356
I wouldn't be joking around here.

42:58.532 --> 43:01.812
Sorry, I'm trying not to smile.

43:01.973 --> 43:04.932
All right, get out.

43:05.093 --> 43:08.053
Get out of here.

43:16.654 --> 43:17.611
I can walk.

43:17.636 --> 43:21.118
Not while you're in this hospital.

43:24.015 --> 43:27.164
Can you pick up the pace a little?

43:27.189 --> 43:30.800
If you want drugs, see the nurse.

44:06.020 --> 44:09.220
Get out of the way.

44:14.181 --> 44:17.343
Good morning, gentlemen.

44:17.367 --> 44:19.605
Right this way.

44:23.302 --> 44:28.062
Neither Mr. Burns nor Mr. Trickle have any significant cranial injury.

44:28.262 --> 44:30.185
Let's have that in English.

44:30.210 --> 44:32.487
Did they mess up their squash?

44:32.623 --> 44:34.568
Their brains are intact...

44:34.593 --> 44:36.688
as much as they ever were.

44:36.824 --> 44:39.165
Do they get clearance to race?

44:39.190 --> 44:41.608
It's a dangerous pastime.

44:41.784 --> 44:44.107
That's not a medical objection.

44:44.132 --> 44:47.129
They won't get clearance just yet.

44:47.264 --> 44:49.574
That's total horseshit.

44:49.599 --> 44:52.209
Gentlemen, please...

44:52.345 --> 44:54.662
I think they'd like another opinion.

44:54.687 --> 44:56.810
We'd like to talk to your boss.

45:03.026 --> 45:05.467
Which is a re-evaluation in a week or two.

45:05.627 --> 45:06.395
Thank you.

45:06.420 --> 45:09.491
We have something to say to the boys in private.

45:17.188 --> 45:19.628
Okay, Big John's turn.

45:25.509 --> 45:30.749
If you want to become a greasy spot on a country road, go ahead.

45:30.909 --> 45:34.350
I don't give a shit and I don't think anybody else does.

45:34.550 --> 45:38.911
But you're not going to do it on my racetrack.

45:39.110 --> 45:44.391
You've all heard of Japanese inspection?

45:44.551 --> 45:48.991
When the Japs get a load of lettuce they don't want in the country,

45:49.192 --> 45:53.552
they let it sit on the docks until they get ready to look at it.

45:53.752 --> 45:58.992
By then it's all gone rotten. There's nothing left to inspect.

45:59.153 --> 46:03.914
Lettuce is a perishable item, like you two monkeys.

46:04.113 --> 46:09.554
You trade paint one more time, I'll black flag the two of you.

46:09.714 --> 46:14.234
I'll take apart your race car for inspection.

46:14.435 --> 46:18.195
After you've put it back together, you can race.

46:18.355 --> 46:23.035
Now, as there's no hard feelings, we're all going out to dinner.

46:23.196 --> 46:25.234
I've got other plans.

46:25.259 --> 46:28.460
You'll have to change them.

46:28.596 --> 46:33.357
You two are going to drive to dinner together.

46:39.558 --> 46:41.838
Dr Lewicki...

46:42.038 --> 46:46.719
I want to apologize for what happened with Cole.

46:46.878 --> 46:49.628
It's nothing to worry about.

46:49.653 --> 46:52.303
It was hardly your doing.

46:52.439 --> 46:55.114
That's just it, it was.

46:55.139 --> 47:00.024
Not long ago, we played a trick on Cole.

47:00.160 --> 47:04.360
We dressed up a pretty girl in a highway-patrol uniform.

47:04.521 --> 47:10.040
We told her to get real ornery with him and she did.

47:10.201 --> 47:11.558
You mean..?

47:11.583 --> 47:14.665
I mean real ornery.

47:14.842 --> 47:17.853
Why do you want me to know this?

47:17.878 --> 47:21.546
Don't hold a bad opinion of Cole.

47:21.683 --> 47:23.684
I believe it scares him.

47:23.709 --> 47:27.627
He needs reassurance from you that he's okay.

47:27.763 --> 47:31.363
After all, you're his doctor.

47:36.004 --> 47:38.884
That's it.

47:56.846 --> 47:58.806
Doc...

47:59.006 --> 48:04.847
I heard you thought I was a highway-patrol officer.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.557
Thank you for taking care of me.

48:07.582 --> 48:08.992
It's my job.

48:09.128 --> 48:10.931
It's my life.

48:10.956 --> 48:15.672
This time let's shake hands.

48:15.808 --> 48:17.221
Of course.

48:17.246 --> 48:20.353
Good luck, Cole.

48:27.210 --> 48:29.513
Dr Lewicki, could I see you?

48:29.538 --> 48:31.675
You will, I promise.

48:31.850 --> 48:37.051
I mean have some dinner, I'll take you to a race.

48:37.211 --> 48:42.531
That's very sweet, but it won't get you back on the track any faster.

48:42.691 --> 48:44.652
No...

48:44.851 --> 48:48.292
It's not what I meant.

49:10.015 --> 49:10.702
Now what?

49:10.727 --> 49:13.399
Here's how I see this deal...

49:13.575 --> 49:19.256
Neither of us is going to let the other drive this car to dinner.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.953
There's only one way to settle it.

49:21.978 --> 49:24.440
What are you talking about?

49:27.776 --> 49:30.657
Absolutely.

50:08.021 --> 50:10.508
Let me tell you something.

50:10.533 --> 50:14.646
If you can't control your race drivers...

50:16.463 --> 50:19.263
Stick to something you can control.

50:21.543 --> 50:25.904
Like used cars in downtown Charlotte.

50:45.786 --> 50:47.722
Too close to call?

50:47.747 --> 50:48.930
Yeah.

50:59.587 --> 51:01.235
You're late.

51:01.260 --> 51:04.692
We had car trouble.

51:04.828 --> 51:07.599
What kind of car trouble?

51:07.624 --> 51:11.613
I believe it was the radiator.

51:11.749 --> 51:15.509
Yes, Rowdy, I believe it was.

51:22.670 --> 51:25.030
Do you know anybody at Daytona Memorial?

51:25.191 --> 51:27.054
The chief of staff.

51:27.079 --> 51:29.334
Is he a race fan?

51:29.511 --> 51:34.352
Russ Wheeler is driving for us, till you get your medical clearance.

51:34.512 --> 51:38.511
It's a real pleasure to race your car, Mr. Trickle.

51:38.672 --> 51:43.032
I need the home address of a doctor...

51:43.192 --> 51:48.273
I'm only sorry I won't be able to drive it as good as you.

51:48.433 --> 51:52.273
I'll see you later, Harry.

51:52.433 --> 51:55.634
The doctor...

52:00.274 --> 52:03.234
What?

52:18.316 --> 52:22.437
I was desperate to get your attention.

52:22.637 --> 52:23.884
You got it.

52:23.909 --> 52:26.741
I walked into a jungle.

52:26.877 --> 52:30.331
It's nicely extravagant, but I can't.

52:30.356 --> 52:32.502
I'm a doctor on call.

52:32.638 --> 52:35.553
Somebody has to re-examine me.

52:35.578 --> 52:38.102
I'll take you to a race.

52:38.239 --> 52:43.920
I don't want to watch you guys chasing each other on my day off.

52:44.080 --> 52:47.040
How about chasing me on your day off?

52:47.240 --> 52:49.540
I don't have a day off.

52:49.565 --> 52:51.864
I'm on call 24 hours.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.851
Let's suppose you had a day off.

52:54.876 --> 52:55.944
Sugar.

52:58.521 --> 53:01.482
Could I interest you in the North Carolina countryside?

53:01.641 --> 53:03.128
Speaking theoretically?

53:03.153 --> 53:05.026
Speaking theoretically.

53:05.162 --> 53:05.818
Maybe.

53:05.843 --> 53:08.466
You'd have to convince my boss.

53:08.602 --> 53:12.202
Good. How tall are you?

53:27.244 --> 53:28.652
What did he say?

53:28.677 --> 53:32.109
Fly to Charlotte to see the boys.

53:35.805 --> 53:39.846
You're very quick.

53:40.006 --> 53:44.206
You ought to see me drive.

53:46.487 --> 53:47.940
Rowdy is not here.

53:47.965 --> 53:50.871
I told him to be here by five.

53:51.007 --> 53:55.607
We should probably get started on Cole.

53:58.488 --> 54:01.328
Close your eyes. Palms up.

54:03.248 --> 54:06.769
Open your eyes. Arms down.

54:07.729 --> 54:10.329
Follow my finger.

54:24.411 --> 54:28.771
Stand with your feet together and close your eyes.

54:30.772 --> 54:33.544
Walk one foot in front of the other.

54:33.569 --> 54:34.876
Open your eyes.

54:36.973 --> 54:40.172
Back on the table.

54:45.854 --> 54:47.470
This is tough.

54:47.495 --> 54:50.958
Examinations always are.

54:51.094 --> 54:54.375
I might not like what I see.

54:54.535 --> 54:56.631
That has to worry you.

54:56.655 --> 55:00.559
Pick a spot on the wall and look at it.

55:03.535 --> 55:06.672
Please, don't move your eyes.

55:06.697 --> 55:09.400
Just focus on one spot.

55:17.737 --> 55:20.045
What do you see?

55:20.070 --> 55:22.522
The retina.

55:22.657 --> 55:26.618
What does it look like?

55:26.779 --> 55:30.898
Very pretty, actually.

55:36.699 --> 55:37.891
Seen enough?

55:37.916 --> 55:39.603
Just about.

55:42.019 --> 55:44.427
What did you do that for?

55:44.452 --> 55:47.244
It's the Lowinski sign.

55:47.380 --> 55:50.348
If the toe goes up, you're in trouble.

55:50.373 --> 55:52.325
You're cleared to race.

56:10.183 --> 56:14.624
I'm sorry, it just drove me nuts in there.

56:15.544 --> 56:18.483
How could you ignore me like that?

56:18.508 --> 56:20.928
I wasn't ignoring you!

56:26.065 --> 56:27.840
I wasn't ignoring you.

56:27.865 --> 56:30.929
I gave you a very thorough physical.

56:37.906 --> 56:40.508
Don't do anything weird.

56:40.533 --> 56:42.051
I won't.

56:42.226 --> 56:45.507
It's something Harry and I work on together.

56:45.667 --> 56:48.547
It's called draughting.

56:48.748 --> 56:51.307
One car tucks in behind another.

56:51.332 --> 56:54.052
Two cars can go faster than one.

56:54.188 --> 56:57.949
They divide the air resistance.

56:58.148 --> 57:02.269
The lead car has to floor it to hit 200 mph.

57:02.469 --> 57:04.059
The car behind doesn't.

57:04.084 --> 57:07.333
He can go just as fast with power in reserve.

57:07.469 --> 57:11.150
When these two cars come off that last turn,

57:11.310 --> 57:15.590
the car at the back can move out of the draught,

57:15.750 --> 57:21.511
slingshot past the lead car and beat it to the finish line.

57:22.751 --> 57:25.871
He goes straight to Victory Lane.

57:26.032 --> 57:29.860
You and Harry work on that?

57:29.885 --> 57:32.577
More or less.

57:32.712 --> 57:38.953
Yeah, right. Is there anything you want to do besides racing?

57:42.634 --> 57:44.737
Anything you say.

57:44.762 --> 57:49.338
You must want something else...

57:49.474 --> 57:52.515
eventually.

57:54.115 --> 58:00.435
I can tell you what I don't want to be in life, and that's a fraud.

58:00.636 --> 58:06.717
I want to know it's not just luck that gets me round that racetrack.

58:06.916 --> 58:09.708
But that's not what you're asking.

58:09.733 --> 58:11.621
What am I asking?

58:11.757 --> 58:14.924
How can I be in bed with this guy?

58:14.949 --> 58:18.301
I know the answer to that one.

58:18.438 --> 58:24.919
How could a brilliant brain doctor be in bed with a racing driver?

58:27.438 --> 58:31.879
What's your response to that, by the way?

58:32.080 --> 58:36.760
Do something to make me respect you.

58:36.960 --> 58:41.160
Tell me what you love so much about racing.

58:41.360 --> 58:44.241
The speed.

58:44.401 --> 58:47.121
To be able to control it.

58:47.281 --> 58:52.281
To know that I can control something that's out of control.

58:53.842 --> 58:58.202
I'd really have to show you.

58:58.403 --> 59:01.283
Show me.

59:20.965 --> 59:27.805
It's funny. When I grew up, all I wanted to do was work on race cars.

59:27.965 --> 59:32.727
Now all I want to do is to make enough money to work on a farm.

59:32.926 --> 59:35.147
Hi, Claire, I'm Jennie.

59:35.172 --> 59:37.391
Nice to meet you.

59:43.128 --> 59:46.568
We're going to build our permanent home up there.

59:46.728 --> 59:48.374
Does it cost much?

59:48.399 --> 59:50.592
About $10 million.

59:50.728 --> 59:52.709
Jennie's doing the building.

59:52.734 --> 59:54.712
She's designing the house.

59:54.849 --> 59:59.689
We just want a place that no one's lived in but us.

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.036
What is it?

01:00:04.061 --> 01:00:05.955
I'm just seasick.

You didn't forget about the physical.

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:18.851
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor unless they're dying.

01:00:19.052 --> 01:00:21.115
I'm just not feeling good.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.996
Stand with your feet together.

01:00:26.493 --> 01:00:29.453
Put your arms out.

01:00:29.652 --> 01:00:32.934
Close your eyes.

01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:39.987
Take it easy.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.998
I've got you.

01:00:43.174 --> 01:00:46.294
I'm fine.

01:00:50.135 --> 01:00:52.095
I'm fine.

01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:55.776
Go back to Daytona.

01:00:55.976 --> 01:00:59.644
The head of neurosurgery is my boss.

01:00:59.669 --> 01:01:02.520
He's as good as they come.

01:01:04.497 --> 01:01:08.697
- Did you get sick in there?
- No.

01:01:08.858 --> 01:01:11.651
He did, he got sick.

01:01:11.676 --> 01:01:16.282
You're one hell of a candy-ass.

01:01:16.419 --> 01:01:21.819
It's imperative that you get back to Daytona and see Dr Wilhaire.

01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:40.981
There's another new Winston Cup team sponsored by Hardee's.

01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:43.941
The driver is Russ Wheeler,

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:47.061
the young man who subbed so superbly for Cole Trickle.

01:01:47.262 --> 01:01:51.622
Listen to this horseshit.

01:01:51.823 --> 01:01:57.182
With these two competitive spirits, will there be any conflict?

01:01:57.343 --> 01:02:03.503
We believe we can maintain the integrity of these two race teams.

01:02:03.704 --> 01:02:06.344
Who will you be rooting for, Tim?

01:02:06.504 --> 01:02:10.504
I'll wave to Cole every time I lap him.

01:02:16.465 --> 01:02:18.274
These new tires are terrible.

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:20.169
You're doing good, Cole.

01:02:20.346 --> 01:02:23.946
I'm too loose.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.666
The car feels all wrong.

01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:32.971
Cole's upset.

01:02:33.107 --> 01:02:34.398
What about?

01:02:34.423 --> 01:02:38.531
About being in that race car.

01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:43.311
Wheeler just passed the eight car.

01:02:43.336 --> 01:02:45.972
He's coming up on your inside.

01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:57.510
Jesus!

01:03:27.273 --> 01:03:30.073
- The engine blew.
- How?

01:03:30.233 --> 01:03:33.434
I'm not a mechanic, Harry.

01:03:45.796 --> 01:03:47.219
I'm in Georgia.

01:03:47.244 --> 01:03:49.900
Rowdy's in North Carolina.

01:03:50.036 --> 01:03:54.556
Somebody better talk him into coming down here.

01:03:54.717 --> 01:04:00.477
The longer he ignores it, the more damage will be done to his brain.

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:01.958
Where's Cole?

01:04:01.983 --> 01:04:04.421
He's on the phone.

01:04:05.718 --> 01:04:09.398
We could use a little privacy.

01:04:13.598 --> 01:04:15.856
What's wrong with him?

01:04:15.881 --> 01:04:19.063
What's wrong is you, Tim.

01:04:19.199 --> 01:04:21.479
Two race teams is one too many!

01:04:21.504 --> 01:04:24.224
It doesn't bother Russ Wheeler.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.680
No, with Cole's reputation Wheeler knows he can bump him all he wants.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.161
I don't see Russ doing anything like that, neither does NASCAR.

01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:39.881
It ain't happening then, under the watchful eyes of you experts!

01:04:40.082 --> 01:04:42.842
I tell you what is happening:

01:04:43.002 --> 01:04:47.442
Cole's not running good and now he's got sponsor trouble.

01:04:47.602 --> 01:04:49.963
- But you don't?
- No.

01:04:50.162 --> 01:04:53.363
But I want to keep the sponsor and Cole.

01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:55.467
He made this all happen.

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:58.403
Right!

01:05:02.844 --> 01:05:05.980
Were you on the phone with the doc?

01:05:06.005 --> 01:05:06.989
Fighting?

01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:10.605
She's too busy to talk right now.

01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:13.085
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:16.170
Russ ran a great race today.

01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:18.150
I'm very pleased.

01:05:18.326 --> 01:05:22.686
102 laps complete, but we're under caution here at North Wilkesboro.

01:05:22.887 --> 01:05:25.401
Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet.

01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:29.151
Cole's just like any other driver.

01:05:29.327 --> 01:05:33.088
He doesn't want to see Rowdy.

01:05:33.248 --> 01:05:38.328
Drivers don't like to be reminded of what can happen to them out there.

01:05:38.488 --> 01:05:44.409
The only time a driver goes to a funeral is when he's actually dead.

01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:08.699
He's blocking me.

01:06:08.724 --> 01:06:11.236
That's right.

01:06:11.412 --> 01:06:15.173
Move the son of a bitch!

01:07:05.539 --> 01:07:07.179
Son of a bitch!

01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:12.659
Trickle at the bottom of the track with both right-side tires flat.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.500
Wheeler takes the chequered flag.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.461
Wheeler doesn't deserve to win.

01:07:24.486 --> 01:07:27.365
That's low-down shit-assed racing.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.541
It's just racing. Cole overreacted.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.187
Change my tires.

01:07:39.212 --> 01:07:41.688
I don't know what for.

01:07:41.713 --> 01:07:42.950
It's over.

01:08:14.027 --> 01:08:18.386
There seems to be a little post-race activity just outside the pit lane.

01:08:18.546 --> 01:08:21.987
You shit!

01:08:22.147 --> 01:08:27.148
He's destroyed both my cars!

01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:29.234
He's fired!

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:32.412
You're all fired!

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:49.009
Are you heading off to Daytona?

01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:52.214
Where are you going from here?

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:54.852
I'll take you to the airport.

01:08:54.877 --> 01:08:57.895
I'll catch a flight to Charlotte.

01:09:00.031 --> 01:09:02.863
You want me to come with you?

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.816
What about the hospital?

01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:12.113
We could try to see Rowdy.

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:17.220
Is there anything wrong with that?

01:09:17.246 --> 01:09:19.096
Of course not.

01:09:19.234 --> 01:09:21.234
I guess I forgot about that.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.617
Yeah, I know.

01:09:36.156 --> 01:09:38.956
Let me out of the car.

01:09:40.956 --> 01:09:42.916
Let me out.

01:09:47.957 --> 01:09:51.978
Let me out or I'm getting out.

01:09:52.002 --> 01:09:53.341
Hey!

01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:58.358
Claire! Wait.

01:09:58.518 --> 01:10:00.871
Get away or I'll call the police.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.463
I'm not leaving until we talk.

01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:05.751
I've got nothing to say.

01:10:05.776 --> 01:10:07.183
Well I do!

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:12.680
That's it? Fine.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.840
You shouldn't be driving a car, not on a road or a racetrack.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.361
You're selfish, you're crazy and you're scared.

01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:23.491
You and Rowdy have a sickness.

01:10:23.516 --> 01:10:24.865
It's called denial.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:29.042
And it's probably going to kill you both.

01:10:32.202 --> 01:10:35.803
You want to control something that's out of control, right?

01:10:35.963 --> 01:10:40.323
I'm going to let you in on a secret that most other people know.

01:10:40.523 --> 01:10:44.884
Control is an illusion. Nobody knows what's going to happen next.

01:10:45.043 --> 01:10:47.243
Not on a freeway,

01:10:47.403 --> 01:10:51.844
and certainly not on a racetrack with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

01:10:52.045 --> 01:10:53.707
Nobody controls anything.

01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:56.988
You've had a glimpse of that and you're scared.

01:10:57.165 --> 01:11:01.925
You might not have the courage to race anymore.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.529
I hate you for this.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.870
You make me sound like a doctor.

01:12:00.852 --> 01:12:03.893
Jennie...

01:12:04.092 --> 01:12:07.053
Why are you here?

01:12:08.053 --> 01:12:11.414
Where is he?

01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:24.354
I hear you're out of a job.

01:12:24.379 --> 01:12:25.559
Yeah.

01:12:29.335 --> 01:12:32.936
You're not looking too good.

01:12:33.096 --> 01:12:35.001
How many of these do you take?

01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:37.120
What did you come here for?

01:12:40.737 --> 01:12:43.937
To take you to the hospital.

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:49.778
If it wasn't for that woman doctor, I'd be back on the track.

01:12:49.938 --> 01:12:51.259
Is that right?

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:53.642
Yeah, that's right.

01:12:53.819 --> 01:12:59.819
I've raced with my legs broken, heart bruised and eyes popping out.

01:13:01.179 --> 01:13:03.538
This is going to go away.

01:13:03.563 --> 01:13:06.204
I'm going to live forever,

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:11.740
unless I go to some damn hospital where you just lay down and die.

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:17.224
What did you win this for?

01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:19.925
This one right here.

01:13:21.341 --> 01:13:23.216
Doesn't it say?

01:13:23.241 --> 01:13:27.366
Yeah, it's the Winston Cup.

01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:29.142
What's your name?

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:32.647
Or has that slipped your mind, too?

01:13:34.064 --> 01:13:36.048
Screw you, man.

01:13:36.073 --> 01:13:37.527
Okay.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:43.184
We can go down there and fix your head or we can fix it right here!

01:13:47.745 --> 01:13:51.185
Rowdy would like to see you.

01:13:56.025 --> 01:13:57.256
How is he?

01:13:57.281 --> 01:13:59.250
He's okay.

01:13:59.425 --> 01:14:01.262
How are you?

01:14:01.287 --> 01:14:02.970
Good.

01:14:03.107 --> 01:14:04.374
Will he make Daytona?

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.811
He'll make it out of the hospital.

01:14:06.947 --> 01:14:11.787
But he'll never drive a race car again.

01:14:17.028 --> 01:14:18.417
This is Dr Wilhaire.

01:14:18.442 --> 01:14:21.012
He's going to be doing the surgery.

01:14:21.148 --> 01:14:23.509
Cole Trickle.

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:25.949
How is he?

01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:30.670
The doc says I need minor brain surgery.

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:35.830
Any surgery on his brain is bound to be minor.

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:39.444
Can I talk to this guy a second?

01:14:39.469 --> 01:14:41.174
Of course.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:54.192
A blood vessel in my brain busted.

01:14:54.352 --> 01:15:00.032
They want to drill a hole in my head and get rid of the blood.

01:15:03.233 --> 01:15:04.303
Should I let them do it?

01:15:04.328 --> 01:15:04.817
Yeah.

01:15:04.954 --> 01:15:07.678
You'd let them if it was you?

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.017
I would.

01:15:09.194 --> 01:15:15.115
Then I've got to ask you to do something for me.

01:15:15.275 --> 01:15:17.008
Drive my car.

01:15:17.033 --> 01:15:18.499
What?

01:15:18.675 --> 01:15:21.715
Daytona.

01:15:23.155 --> 01:15:26.836
You've got plenty of time to get ready for Daytona.

01:15:28.676 --> 01:15:30.526
I lost my sponsor.

01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:36.101
They're not sure I'm going to come out of this deal.

01:15:36.276 --> 01:15:39.317
Are you?

01:15:40.917 --> 01:15:44.838
I've got a lot of land and a lot of plans I ain't paid for.

01:15:44.998 --> 01:15:49.598
So to get my sponsor back, my car has to run good at Daytona.

01:15:49.799 --> 01:15:53.399
All that network TV shit.

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:56.366
There's plenty of other drivers.

01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:58.983
Don't give me that shit.

01:15:59.159 --> 01:16:02.520
My car has to be in the top five,

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.000
before my sponsors will pick up the tab for the year.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.802
Maybe after Daytona I can drive.

01:16:11.961 --> 01:16:18.282
In the meantime, I want the best for my family, so don't bullshit me.

01:16:18.442 --> 01:16:25.282
Is there some other reason why I ain't good enough to drive for?

01:16:33.123 --> 01:16:36.324
Then you'll do it?

01:16:48.245 --> 01:16:51.365
Shit, man! You had me going.

01:16:52.966 --> 01:16:54.792
Let's get down to business.

01:16:54.817 --> 01:16:56.910
What's your deal with Daland?

01:17:00.086 --> 01:17:02.496
I haven't worked it out.

01:17:02.521 --> 01:17:05.031
Excuse me for a second.

01:17:08.528 --> 01:17:10.124
Cole, what's wrong?

01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:12.752
Tell Rowdy I'll call him.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:29.473
No, sir!

01:17:29.498 --> 01:17:30.943
Can't use 'em.

01:17:30.968 --> 01:17:32.525
Don't want 'em.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:34.419
Can't afford 'em.

01:17:34.531 --> 01:17:36.641
What are you talking about?

01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:38.243
Race car drivers.

01:17:38.268 --> 01:17:39.659
You and Rowdy.

01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:43.692
I ain't setting up that car for Daytona.

01:17:43.851 --> 01:17:49.012
But come on in. We'll bring out the moonshine and start telling lies.

01:17:49.173 --> 01:17:51.490
But no talk about racing.

01:17:51.515 --> 01:17:55.037
All right, no talk about racing.

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:58.733
I'll race your ass.

01:18:09.014 --> 01:18:11.026
I'm going to take off.

01:18:11.051 --> 01:18:12.879
Good night, Harry.

01:18:25.377 --> 01:18:28.897
Why won't you set up the car?

01:18:32.497 --> 01:18:36.937
Ever since you and Rowdy crashed at Daytona

01:18:37.097 --> 01:18:41.618
you've been waiting on something bad to happen to you.

01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:44.371
Just like Buddy Bretherton.

01:18:44.396 --> 01:18:47.083
He started hearing voices.

01:18:47.219 --> 01:18:50.100
All of them saying one thing:

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:54.380
"Get out of that race car."

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:02.941
You pegged the engine at Atlanta and blew it sky-high.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:07.581
It was deliberate.

01:19:07.741 --> 01:19:12.982
9,400 rpm according to the telltale button.

01:19:14.543 --> 01:19:17.982
You thought if you didn't get out of that car you'd die.

01:19:18.183 --> 01:19:21.543
Now call me a liar.

01:19:21.703 --> 01:19:22.999
You're not lying.

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:25.847
What are we talking about then?

01:19:25.983 --> 01:19:28.446
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.768
I can't do it without you.

01:19:30.904 --> 01:19:34.825
You can't do it period.

01:19:34.985 --> 01:19:38.944
I ain't going back there, Cole.

01:19:48.706 --> 01:19:51.987
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

01:19:52.146 --> 01:19:55.827
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

01:19:55.987 --> 01:20:00.507
No, he didn't, but you don't want to hear about it.

01:20:01.828 --> 01:20:08.588
NASCAR privately claimed that your car is what killed Buddy.

01:20:09.988 --> 01:20:14.429
You used thin-walled tubing to keep the weight down.

01:20:14.589 --> 01:20:16.819
Carbon monoxide knocked Buddy out.

01:20:16.844 --> 01:20:17.893
Horseshit.

01:20:18.069 --> 01:20:24.510
When Buddy hit the wall, he was talking as fast as he was driving.

01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:30.550
That was the loudest-talking unconscious man you ever heard.

01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:35.351
Why didn't you let them investigate?

01:20:35.511 --> 01:20:40.032
Because I should have known better than to let him drive.

01:20:41.351 --> 01:20:45.232
Buddy was a terrible pain in the ass.

01:20:45.392 --> 01:20:50.993
He thought he knew about cars, which made him twice as ignorant as you.

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:54.954
Still...

01:20:59.514 --> 01:21:02.474
Guys like Buddy...

01:21:02.634 --> 01:21:06.515
I've seen him do things in my car that are unbelievable.

01:21:06.715 --> 01:21:10.156
He showed me what I had done.

01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:14.596
Then you automatically have to sort of love the guy...

01:21:14.796 --> 01:21:18.236
whether you want to or not.

01:21:18.436 --> 01:21:21.877
Buddy Bretherton.

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:25.597
I have to ask you something.

01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:33.919
Before Buddy hit the wall, how was he doing in that race?

01:21:34.078 --> 01:21:37.358
You ornery, no good...

01:21:38.759 --> 01:21:42.359
You stay out of that car.

01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:46.719
If you get back in that car, you'll die. You hear?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.561
I'm not getting back in my car, I'm getting in Rowdy's.

01:21:54.761 --> 01:21:57.320
You dumb drivers.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.521
You think you'll hide from your bad luck in his car?

01:22:01.681 --> 01:22:05.721
He'd crash you tomorrow to win the race!

01:22:05.881 --> 01:22:08.206
He's no particular friend, so why?

01:22:08.231 --> 01:22:09.666
He asked me to.

01:22:09.843 --> 01:22:12.876
You just want to race again.

01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:15.067
And so do you.

01:22:15.203 --> 01:22:18.723
Well, you're scared.

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:22.164
Yeah, and so are you.

01:22:22.844 --> 01:22:25.883
Yeah.

01:22:33.285 --> 01:22:35.925
What?

01:22:37.605 --> 01:22:41.125
I need this, Harry.

01:22:43.246 --> 01:22:46.526
I don't have anything else.

01:22:47.807 --> 01:22:51.407
You've given me a life.

01:22:53.048 --> 01:22:56.167
I don't want to lose it.

01:22:57.648 --> 01:22:59.413
Put me in that car.

01:22:59.438 --> 01:23:03.992
Let me be the one to show you what you've done.

01:23:04.129 --> 01:23:07.009
Just trust me.

01:23:10.730 --> 01:23:12.222
Let me drive.

01:23:12.247 --> 01:23:16.034
I won't make a fool out of you.

01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:32.731
I... honestly don't know how this deal's going to turn out.

01:23:35.173 --> 01:23:38.693
Neither do I, Harry.

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:03.442
I'm setting up for cool weather.

01:24:03.466 --> 01:24:06.680
If the sun breaks, you'll run loose.

01:24:06.855 --> 01:24:10.255
Cole's not ready for that.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.241
He's changed.

01:24:12.376 --> 01:24:16.137
You cannot get out of control.

01:24:16.336 --> 01:24:20.337
He's liable to hurt you and you're liable to hurt him.

01:24:20.497 --> 01:24:23.538
I couldn't handle that.

01:24:23.737 --> 01:24:26.564
You've got to take care of him.

01:24:26.589 --> 01:24:27.682
All right?

01:24:27.818 --> 01:24:31.018
You've got to take care of him.

01:24:40.579 --> 01:24:44.700
This is not the kind of answer I'm looking for from you.

01:24:50.141 --> 01:24:53.741
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

01:24:53.901 --> 01:24:58.741
We're going to keep an eye on Cole to see if he has all his reflexes.

01:24:58.942 --> 01:25:05.022
I don't think that the accident will affect the way Cole performs.

01:25:05.222 --> 01:25:08.583
I hope I beat him.

01:25:08.783 --> 01:25:10.665
A lot of guys don't like him.

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.767
The guy's got a lot of talent.

01:25:12.903 --> 01:25:15.343
He just wants to win.

01:25:15.503 --> 01:25:20.264
He's been a danger to himself and to other drivers.

01:25:20.424 --> 01:25:25.624
If he comes near me, I'm going to put him in the wall.

01:25:25.785 --> 01:25:29.385
I only expect to see him in my rear-view mirror.

01:25:51.427 --> 01:25:54.188
Come in.

01:25:58.189 --> 01:26:02.789
Harry said you wouldn't mind if I stopped by.

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:09.940
How's Rowdy?

01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:13.534
He's getting better every day.

01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:18.511
Especially since you said you were looking forward to racing his car.

01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:21.991
So I lied.

01:26:22.151 --> 01:26:24.252
What are you thinking?

01:26:24.277 --> 01:26:26.856
"What's he thinking?"

01:26:30.512 --> 01:26:32.381
Everybody's the same.

01:26:32.406 --> 01:26:36.857
You've got to be good at your job to enjoy life.

01:26:37.032 --> 01:26:39.673
This is my job.

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:43.194
It's all I know.

01:26:48.074 --> 01:26:52.435
You know I can't watch you do this.

01:26:52.594 --> 01:26:55.355
Claire...

01:26:55.515 --> 01:27:01.276
I'm more afraid of being nothing than I am of being hurt.

01:27:03.876 --> 01:27:06.996
Walk me in?

01:27:09.196 --> 01:27:13.637
Welcome to the Daytona 500, the Superbowl of motor racing.

01:27:13.797 --> 01:27:20.318
Among today's favorites has to be Wheeler in the Hardee's car.

01:27:20.478 --> 01:27:24.919
He's the man to watch, after winning the pole for today's event.

01:27:25.118 --> 01:27:28.159
But don't count out Cole Trickle.

01:27:28.319 --> 01:27:33.479
He's returning to Daytona for the first time since his accident.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.079
I heard you didn't have a sponsor.

01:27:38.239 --> 01:27:43.760
They gave us just enough money to put their name on the car.

01:27:48.281 --> 01:27:49.220
Tim.

01:27:49.245 --> 01:27:51.826
Cole.

01:28:00.683 --> 01:28:02.292
Why is the hood up?

01:28:02.317 --> 01:28:03.587
What's wrong?

01:28:03.723 --> 01:28:05.986
We had to change engines.

01:28:06.011 --> 01:28:09.268
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

01:28:09.403 --> 01:28:11.579
Why did you change engines?

01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:14.828
There was metal in the oil filter.

01:28:14.964 --> 01:28:16.988
Where did you get the engine?

01:28:17.013 --> 01:28:18.269
We stole it.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:30.326
Claire, put the boy in his car before he starts sweating.

01:28:46.768 --> 01:28:51.128
So, are you going to get in your car and take off?

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:57.248
Drive carefully.

01:29:25.052 --> 01:29:27.653
Gentlemen, start your engines.

01:29:42.374 --> 01:29:43.910
We are underway.

01:29:43.935 --> 01:29:46.239
The Daytona 500 is on.

01:29:54.896 --> 01:30:00.337
We are 56 laps into the 200-lap event and Wheeler is in the lead.

01:30:03.337 --> 01:30:04.417
You're 47:01. The leader's 45:90.

01:30:04.442 --> 01:30:05.161
You're running last.

01:30:09.217 --> 01:30:13.578
What's going on, Cole?

01:30:15.738 --> 01:30:18.778
Are you all right?

01:30:39.821 --> 01:30:41.935
There's a crash at turn three.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.285
Oil at the bottom of the track.

01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:51.622
Cars are sliding down from the top of the track.

01:30:51.822 --> 01:30:53.310
You'd better go high.

01:30:53.335 --> 01:30:55.887
Pick a line you can drive through.

01:30:58.423 --> 01:31:00.976
Cole, are you all right?

01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:03.127
Answer me, please.

01:31:04.743 --> 01:31:06.474
Go around those wrecks.

01:31:06.499 --> 01:31:08.528
You can drive through it.

01:31:08.704 --> 01:31:12.665
I know it in my heart.

01:31:24.786 --> 01:31:27.146
I'm through it, Harry!

01:31:29.146 --> 01:31:32.426
I'm out of here.

01:31:39.748 --> 01:31:42.547
Cole's moved up to ninth.

01:31:43.948 --> 01:31:49.469
Wheeler continues to lead, but the man on the move is Cole Trickle.

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:58.710
I'm going to make a hole to get through here.

01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.311
Here we go.

01:32:15.631 --> 01:32:17.901
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz.

01:32:17.926 --> 01:32:19.176
Ganz spun out.

01:32:24.152 --> 01:32:26.559
He's going high.

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:28.538
Goddamn it!

01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:31.994
Trickle takes the lead.

01:32:32.194 --> 01:32:35.474
Go, Cole.

01:32:37.594 --> 01:32:40.795
This is what it's all about.

01:32:42.634 --> 01:32:46.835
With 23 laps to go, Cole Trickle is leading.

01:32:47.035 --> 01:32:48.672
Take him now, Russ.

01:32:48.697 --> 01:32:50.420
He's all mine.

01:33:02.477 --> 01:33:05.358
The accelerator is stuck.

01:33:07.678 --> 01:33:10.438
I can't slow down.

01:33:10.598 --> 01:33:15.359
Step on the clutch and let the son of a bitch blow it.

01:33:19.159 --> 01:33:21.199
Son of a...

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.001
The accelerator is fixed, but the transmission is screwed.

01:33:49.283 --> 01:33:51.283
Are they out of the race?

01:33:51.308 --> 01:33:52.827
They will be.

01:33:52.963 --> 01:33:57.243
Get me out in front of the pace car or the race is over for us!

01:33:57.443 --> 01:33:59.781
The linkage is all twisted.

01:33:59.806 --> 01:34:01.171
Just give him

01:34:01.196 --> 01:34:02.772
the high gear.

01:34:02.884 --> 01:34:05.142
I've got it.

01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:07.989
Let's go.

01:34:08.124 --> 01:34:09.200
Come on.

01:34:09.224 --> 01:34:11.509
Go! Go! Go!

01:34:11.686 --> 01:34:14.646
Get out there and help them!

01:34:24.166 --> 01:34:25.413
We made it.

01:34:25.438 --> 01:34:26.660
Good work.

01:34:26.685 --> 01:34:28.951
I owe you one.

01:34:30.448 --> 01:34:32.888
That's not your car.

01:34:33.048 --> 01:34:36.487
It's my engine in that car and that's what my boys are pushing.

01:34:39.928 --> 01:34:44.448
You've got to be at top speed when the green flag drops.

01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:51.330
The green flag is out and racing resumes.

01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:54.730
Wheeler's still in the lead.

01:34:59.091 --> 01:35:00.121
Where am I?

01:35:00.146 --> 01:35:02.955
Ninth. Eight laps to go.

01:35:08.692 --> 01:35:10.699
Am I gaining on Wheeler?

01:35:10.724 --> 01:35:13.316
Trickle's moving up fast.

01:35:22.813 --> 01:35:25.093
Remember me?

01:35:30.774 --> 01:35:35.535
I'm going to draught Wheeler, make him pull me around.

01:35:37.175 --> 01:35:40.375
He's on my ass.

01:35:42.655 --> 01:35:44.310
He's going on the outside.

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:46.560
I'm going to put him in the wall.

01:35:55.537 --> 01:35:58.498
I'm setting him up, Harry.

01:35:58.657 --> 01:36:01.370
There's the white flag.

01:36:01.395 --> 01:36:03.282
One lap to go.

01:36:15.419 --> 01:36:18.449
Don't keep this up, Cole, please.

01:36:18.474 --> 01:36:21.043
This guy's going down!

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.440
Last turn, Russ.

01:36:27.465 --> 01:36:30.045
He'll try and slingshot past you.

01:36:30.181 --> 01:36:31.251
I know Cole.

01:36:31.276 --> 01:36:34.125
He always goes to the outside.

01:36:34.261 --> 01:36:37.221
This one's for you, Harry.

01:36:38.142 --> 01:36:40.822
He's going high.

01:36:43.463 --> 01:36:46.142
He's going low!

01:36:46.303 --> 01:36:49.183
Son of a bitch!

01:36:52.343 --> 01:36:57.464
Here comes the finish line, and Cole Trickle takes the win!

01:37:35.628 --> 01:37:39.748
- You weren't going to watch.
- I lied.

01:37:44.869 --> 01:37:46.363
Where's Harry?

01:37:46.388 --> 01:37:48.414
I don't know.

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.511
Harry...

01:38:01.431 --> 01:38:04.632
Say something, will you?

01:38:04.657 --> 01:38:07.456
I really can't.

01:38:11.313 --> 01:38:14.913
You didn't know how this was going to turn out.

01:38:15.073 --> 01:38:21.753
It's like you said: There's nothing you can't do in a race car.

01:38:23.234 --> 01:38:24.816
We won.

01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:27.099
Yeah.

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:32.155
Can you walk, or am I going to have to carry you?

01:38:32.355 --> 01:38:34.476
Where to?

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.447
Victory Lane.

01:38:36.472 --> 01:38:38.379
Oh yeah.

01:38:39.876 --> 01:38:42.717
Walk? Hell...

01:38:45.037 --> 01:38:48.477
I'll race your ass!
