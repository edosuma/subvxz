00:35.880 --> 00:38.040
I've always had
a weakness for powerful men.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.120
Go on, son! Get him out, take him
out! Do it!

01:40.360 --> 01:42.760
Ah, you should have been there,
Father.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.119
Seen it close up.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
What a fight!

01:46.240 --> 01:47.520
Third straight knockout.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.480
Connor McNeive, now,
he was class opposition,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.520
and my boy laid him out in four.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.239
Now that takes some guts.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
Takes some heart.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.000
I remember the first time
I saw him box.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.200
Oh, he was a cheeky little sod,
wasn't he, eh?

02:01.240 --> 02:03.480
Always looking for trouble.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.880
This club has changed his life.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.320
It's like most of the lads.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.320
All they need is someone to
believe in them.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.879
Jeb came good.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.320
Did us both proud.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.240
Do you know, the phone hasn't
stopped ringing?

02:16.280 --> 02:18.160
They all want a piece of
The Chedworth Cyclone.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.399
Hey, hey, hey! I thought I told you
to rest up?

02:24.400 --> 02:27.920
Brought you this. First amateur
trophy I ever won.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.296
You can put it on the shelf, in case
I get too big for my boots.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.920
Well, er... Yeah, I might just find
room for it.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.480
The padre's here for a debrief.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.160
I hear it was quite a fight.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.439
Not bad for a boy with no prospects.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.680
I thought you got lucky, Jeb.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.519
Sorry? Something you want to
say to my face?

02:44.520 --> 02:47.240
Here he is! The man of the moment.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.960
Just thought I'd see how you're
holding up.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.360
I'm doing good thanks, Mr Nelson.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.759
Good. I told you, didn't I?

02:52.760 --> 02:54.280
This lad is going all the way.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.919
What's all this? Bells of St Mary's?

02:57.920 --> 03:00.359
Father Brown's
a big supporter of the club.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.080
The church sponsored Jeb as
an amateur.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.120
Keeping these boys on the
straight and narrow, eh?

03:06.680 --> 03:08.480
I'm here if they need me.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.919
Mr Nelson's our London promoter.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.120
I've been sorting out your
next bout.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.560
Well, I think what the lad needs
now is some R&R.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.039
A crack at a title.
Southern Area Belt.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.640
You will be taking on
Bethnal Green's finest.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.840
Devon Hoyle?

03:21.880 --> 03:23.920
Seven straight wins, son.
You've earned it.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.520
Course he has.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.599
You stick with me, boy. I'll make
you bigger than Freddie Mills.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.000
Any news on the venue?

03:31.040 --> 03:35.080
I was thinking of Cheltenham Town
Hall. Decent purse, home advantage.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.160
Place will be a sell-out.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.720
I doubt you'd get a licence.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.080
Well, I'm working on that one.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.599
Don't take it personally.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.120
We were getting on so well.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.160
Yeah, weren't we?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.240
That title bout was mine, that was.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.800
I'm still a decent prospect.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.640
Top flight, pound for pound.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.296
Yeah, well, I've heard
you're washed up, Roy.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.800
Bit too fond of the old grog.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.800
Just give us a fight on the
undercard then, yeah?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.358
An opener for Jeb.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.560
Please, Mr Nelson? I need this.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.160
I've got my reputation to consider.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.240
I've been your eyes and ears
in that gym, I have.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.776
Does that not count for
anything at all?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.119
Look, if you're that desperate,

04:29.120 --> 04:31.360
I could always throw a bit more
door work your way.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.640
How does that grab you?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.600
So, this boxer of yours must be
something special.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.240
The fight's already a sell-out.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.640
He was a gifted amateur.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.320
Well, good thing I've managed to bag
us some front-row seats.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.360
Boxing is a pursuit of reprobates.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.360
Poppycock!

04:58.400 --> 05:01.800
And why the church ever sponsored
Jeb Cornish, I will never know.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.440
You've clearly never heard of the
Queensberry rules.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.719
Builds moral fibre.
Isn't that right, Father?

05:07.720 --> 05:11.040
I've always thought boxing
has a certain purity to it.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.200
And since when has pugilism been
a pastime of yours?

05:14.240 --> 05:17.519
Well, I'm more intrigued by
Dennis Nelson.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.880
Ah, you've heard of him?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.359
Bit of a gangster by all accounts.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.799
Runs a string of Soho clubs.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.360
There! What did I tell you?
Reprobates.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.800
Which is why I've agreed to keep an
eye on Jeb's training.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.919
Pastoral care.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.239
Any chance of a lift?

05:31.240 --> 05:32.240
Hop in.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.560
That's it.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.879
Fast, straight punches.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.320
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy, easy!

05:43.360 --> 05:45.919
You bruise those knuckles,
you're no use to anyone.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.920
Come to check on Joe Palooka,
have you?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.319
How's he shaping up?

05:49.320 --> 05:50.160
Ha!

05:50.200 --> 05:53.000
He'll be lucky to make the weight
with that big chip on his shoulder.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.840
Now, Hoyle's defence is the best in
the business, right.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.959
He's big, he's strong,
but you're quicker, right?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
Stay focused. That's it.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.799
Come on! That's it.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.960
Ah, just give us a minute.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.640
Hey!

06:08.680 --> 06:10.159
This is where it's won or lost.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.480
This is where it hurts, son.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.680
So you keep telling me.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.040
Right.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.480
On that punch ball.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.000
Come on, come on! Work those feet.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.840
I want you dancing like Nijinsky.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.960
He was late for training
this morning.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.040
I don't know why I bother,
if his heart's not there.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.159
Perhaps you're working him too hard?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.840
I've less than a fortnight to
lick him into shape.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.360
What if he's not ready?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.240
He'll have to be, won't he?

06:42.280 --> 06:43.920
Because you don't say no
to Dennis Nelson.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.160
Just speak to him, will you, Father?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.200
Sort this out and leave the rest
to me, eh.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.080
Teddy is hard to please.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.480
I can't seem to do anything right.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.360
There's a lot riding on this fight.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.880
You think I can't handle
the pressure?

07:13.680 --> 07:16.160
He said that you were late for
training this morning.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.160
If there's anything on your mind,

07:21.200 --> 07:22.440
you can talk to me.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.080
There's a girl.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.880
Someone I need to impress.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.120
The most beautiful girl
I ever laid eyes on.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.160
Yes, well, that would be
a tempting distraction.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.640
I'm seeing her again Thursday night.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.960
Teddy wouldn't approve.
He says women and boxing don't mix.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.280
You sound smitten.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.999
I'm going to ask her to marry me -

07:44.000 --> 07:45.320
as soon as I win that belt.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.440
Hey, we'll need a priest.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.600
Perhaps I should meet her first.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.000
She'll be there at the fight.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.200
Can't get enough of me.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.319
Jab! That's right, jab.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.559
One-two.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.079
Keep your chin down, that's right.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.199
Jab. Jab. One-two.
Right, uppercut.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.599
Come on. Come on, drive through with
your legs! Come on!

08:31.600 --> 08:32.879
Well done, good lad.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.840
Right, Spence, get in and spar
with the kid.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.078
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.600
Let's see how he does against some
real competition, shall we?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.240
Right, this one wants to do
you some damage.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
I'd like to see him try.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.536
Yeah, well, he doesn't want you fit
for the fight, right.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.440
I can handle him.
Right, make sure you do.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.840
Come on, then, Cyclone. I thought
you were supposed to be quick?

08:59.720 --> 09:01.080
You're a punch out, Cornish.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.280
You're all talk, you are.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.776
Is that the best you've got?

09:05.800 --> 09:08.239
You won't last five minutes
in there against Hoyle.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.640
You know that, don't you?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.080
What's the matter, are you jealous?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.520
You're too old for this game, pal.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.160
I could drop you like a hot scone.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.200
Come on, are we holding,
or sparring?!

09:22.240 --> 09:23.399
Come on, lads!

09:23.400 --> 09:24.679
Digging holes and catching vermin,

09:24.680 --> 09:26.280
that's all your hands are
any good for.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.800
Come on! Come on! Come on!

09:29.360 --> 09:30.560
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:32.800 --> 09:34.919
Right, what are you doing? Hey?!

09:34.920 --> 09:36.640
You could have cracked some ribs!

09:36.680 --> 09:38.640
Face it, Tomkins,
you're a has-been.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.280
What does that make you then, eh?

09:40.320 --> 09:42.920
You're a has-been waiting to happen,
you are. Hey, hey, come on.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.519
Hey! Hey! What?

09:44.520 --> 09:46.960
Hey, have you been drinking?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.240
What? Have you been drinking?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.519
Right, that's it. Get yourself
dressed and get out of my club.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.520
Do you understand me?
You're finished.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.560
Now, get out!

10:02.520 --> 10:03.719
You all right?

10:03.720 --> 10:04.880
Yeah? You sure?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.280
Well, get that cleaned up.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.120
So, how's the training coming along?

10:20.160 --> 10:22.360
He's as ready as he'll ever be.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.600
Hm! Well, I'll take that as
a resounding endorsement.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.840
Oh, well. Suit yourself, then.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.880
I'm off down The Crown.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.079
One for the road?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.600
Better not. Early start.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.560
I'm meeting Teddy at the gym
early tomorrow.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.760
Ah, the weigh-in - how exciting!

10:45.320 --> 10:46.480
Oi, you! Hop it!

10:52.080 --> 10:54.040
The bookies are raking it in.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.040
Most of the village has taken
a punt.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.840
Lots of money on Jeb to win.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.280
Sentimental favourite.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.920
You can't get decent odds
against him.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.680
BICYCLE BELL

11:03.720 --> 11:05.359
Ah, perfect timing.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.240
I'm just picking up a few things.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.480
Listen, you haven't heard from Jeb,
have you?

11:09.520 --> 11:10.800
He seems to have gone to ground.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.040
I expect he'll meet us there.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.160
Well, he'd better not be late
for that weigh-in.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.040
Ah, look at this.
Who left this open?

11:47.840 --> 11:50.880
Stiff as a board. He's been lying
there all night.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.400
Broken neck, by the look of things.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.960
Well, this bulb's gone.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Would have been dark with
no light on, wouldn't it?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.200
Get your fingers off!

11:58.240 --> 11:59.680
You could be tampering
with evidence.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.200
You saw the deceased in
The Lion last night.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.880
Inspector.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.119
Still suffering from the gout?

12:29.120 --> 12:30.799
Just answer the question.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.479
He left about seven.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.160
Bit the worse for wear.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.240
Fond of a drink, by all accounts.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.840
Tripped and fell.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.680
That wound on his head suggests
he must have fallen backwards.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
We can finish this outside.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.519
You said the door was open this
morning when you arrived.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.960
Aye, that's right, and Father Brown
was with me.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.520
What time did you leave the
club yesterday?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.160
Must have been about six.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.960
A couple of the lads were
still training.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.400
Trust these lads to lock up, do you?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.879
Course I do. They're like family.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.480
According to a witness,

13:06.520 --> 13:08.920
there was an altercation at the club
yesterday afternoon.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.199
Yeah, erm...

13:12.200 --> 13:13.400
Jeb and Roy had a little spat.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.120
Something we should know about?

13:17.680 --> 13:20.319
Roy was getting too fond of
the booze.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.920
I threw him out of the club.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.359
Told him he was finished.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.720
How did he take the bad news?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.800
I suppose he got drunk, as usual.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.040
Drowning his sorrows.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.680
So, why come back to the club?

13:35.920 --> 13:38.839
Maybe he wanted to clean
out his locker?

13:38.840 --> 13:41.440
Or maybe he was looking for trouble.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.480
Goodfellow? Yes, sir.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.080
I want the whole scene
searched thoroughly.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.080
Righty-o, sir.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.760
Look, if you've finished with your
questions, we've got a weigh-in.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.760
Dennis is going to be wondering
where we are.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.759
You're keeping some very dubious
company, Padre.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.640
Dennis Nelson is a piece of work.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.320
Hopefully, I can make him see
the error of his ways.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.160
I'll need to talk to Jeb.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.400
In the meantime, you're free to go.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.600
All right, thanks.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.399
We should think about
postponing the fight.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.919
What, and make Jeb
a victim of circumstance?

14:16.920 --> 14:17.960
No chance!

14:21.040 --> 14:24.039
You think he might have been
pushed? I'm not ruling it out.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.480
Murdered boxers with links to
the Mob?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.160
If the press get a hold of this,
they'll have a field day.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.399
I should never have gotten into the
ring with him.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.240
How many times have I told you,
Roy was drunk, he fell.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.640
He only had himself to blame.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.320
Now, you forget about Roy.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.800
You need to focus on Hoyle.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.799
This doesn't feel right, Father.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.679
Shouldn't we say a prayer,
or something?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.840
Never let sentiment cloud
an opportunity.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.400
Heard about the accident.
Terrible business.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.999
News travels fast.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.560
Father Brown,
still doing your bit for the team?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.199
You knew the deceased, I believe?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.040
I came across him a few times.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.240
Look, maybe we should have
a whip round.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.319
You know, some kind of fitting
memorial.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.519
In the meantime,
we have got a fight to win.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.839
That's exactly what I said.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.639
What do you reckon, eh, Rita?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.720
Does the Chedworth Cyclone
have what it takes?

15:16.720 --> 15:18.920
He certainly looks promising.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.360
ANNOUNCER: Boxers to weigh in,
please.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.840
Oi, don't let me down, son.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.920
Bunty Windermere.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.160
I don't believe we've met.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.439
I would have remembered.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.856
I've never been to
a weigh-in before.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.440
Perhaps you could talk me
through it?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.200
Well, why don't we get closer
to the action?

15:52.440 --> 15:54.080
Seems we've both been abandoned.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.200
Don't worry on my account.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.400
He always comes back.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.680
It grieves me to say,

16:08.720 --> 16:10.000
but the padre does have a point.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.119
Sir...

16:11.120 --> 16:14.560
The angle of the body.
Something just doesn't add up.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.920
You might want to see this, sir.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.120
Blood.

16:27.720 --> 16:33.680
Devon Hoyle weighs in at 100
and 74 pounds!

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
APPLAUSE

16:36.840 --> 16:39.719
They haven't seen this much
excitement since the Gold Cup.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.440
Dennis certainly knows how
to make a splash.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.640
Right, chin up and chest out. And
remember, the fight starts here.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.200
How did you meet him,
if you don't mind me asking?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.439
I was working as a croupier
in one of his clubs.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.199
The Pink Flamingo.

16:58.200 --> 17:04.760
Jeb Cornish weighs in at 100 and
70 pounds!

17:05.839 --> 17:08.839
You must have known Roy Tomkins,
too.

17:08.839 --> 17:09.839
Must I?

17:11.920 --> 17:14.400
He used to work as
a doorman for Mr Nelson.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.199
Plenty of boxers do.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.400
He doesn't go anywhere without
his hired muscle.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.640
He's giving away four pounds.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.359
He looks in fine shape to me.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.200
Now, what are the police doing here?

17:28.240 --> 17:30.639
Inspector,
something I can help you with?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.160
You can call off these clowns
for starters.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.800
We're in the middle of a weigh-in.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.679
Jeb Cornish, I'd like to question
you in connection with the death

17:37.680 --> 17:39.280
of Roy Tomkins.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.599
What?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.120
We can do this down at the station.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.919
You and Roy Tomkins had
a fight at the club.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.920
We were sparring.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.920
This was found in your locker.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.120
Blood stains.
He gave me a bloody nose.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.759
In front of all your peers.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.160
Must have riled you.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.640
I've been looking at your rap sheet.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.520
Juvenile assault charge got you
a stretch in a proovy school.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.680
I've put all that behind me.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.000
What time did you leave the
club yesterday?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.000
Six-thirty? Seven?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.320
Last minute training?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.680
It can make all the difference.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.096
And where did you go when you left?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.280
Home, to bed.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.560
I've got a title fight tomorrow.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.760
We went to your digs.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.239
Had a word with your landlady.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.280
She said she heard you come home
around midnight.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.120
Where were you,

18:48.160 --> 18:49.520
if you weren't at the club?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
No comment.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.879
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Roy Tomkins.

18:55.880 --> 18:56.959
I swear, I didn't do it...

18:56.960 --> 18:59.536
You're not obliged to say anything,
but anything you do say will be

18:59.560 --> 19:01.560
taken in writing and may be
given in evidence.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.839
What makes you so sure it was
murder?

19:05.840 --> 19:08.440
We found traces of blood on the
floor of the gym.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.559
The body was moved.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.640
It must have been heavy.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.199
Well, the killer cleaned up, made
it look like an accident.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.520
Doesn't explain the broken neck.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.879
We've nothing substantial to tie
this to Jeb,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.600
and although he hasn't been able
to account for his whereabouts...

19:23.200 --> 19:25.200
Find him a cell for the night.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.240
Yes, sir.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.160
I suppose ten minutes alone with him
is out of the question?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.759
You suppose correctly.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.440
He's still being questioned
under caution.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.760
If that was all.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.880
Actually...

19:37.920 --> 19:39.120
I'm here as a witness.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.679
I saw Roy arguing with Dennis Nelson
outside the club.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.440
What are you implying?

19:46.480 --> 19:50.600
That perhaps Nelson had
a motive for murder?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.720
After all, we both know what
he's capable of.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.840
Extortion,
prostitution, racketeering...

19:58.880 --> 20:01.039
Quite a list.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.720
As much as I'd like to lock him up,
Dennis Nelson has an alibi.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.400
He was with his girlfriend
all evening.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.359
Rita Simmons.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.159
Not the dumb blonde she
appears to be.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.000
Nelson keeps his hands clean while
she does all his dirty work.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.320
She's lying.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.720
Covering for him.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.759
Unless you can prove it,

20:22.760 --> 20:24.520
I'll settle for the suspect
we've got.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.000
Bit out of the way for your rounds.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.879
I've come to ask for your help.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.520
Look, I'm sorry your boy got
arrested...

20:33.560 --> 20:35.800
You gave Dennis Nelson an alibi.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.520
I told the police I was
with him all night.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.040
You need to tell them the truth.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.400
That you were with Jeb.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.320
I don't know what he told you,
but... He mentioned a girl.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.240
He saw her yesterday.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.560
And why would you possibly
think that was me?

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
The weigh-in.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.920
I saw there was
something between you.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.640
Rather astute for a priest.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.200
Practised intuition.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.719
It was just a bit of fun. It's over.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.520
I don't think Jeb sees it like that.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.720
If Dennis found out,
he'd kill us both.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.480
You think he's capable of murder?

21:19.360 --> 21:20.760
He isn't a man you'd want to cross.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.240
Did Roy Tomkins cross him, I wonder?

21:25.280 --> 21:27.560
NELSON: Rita? Who is it?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
No-one important.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.880
Look, Dennis will see he gets out.
He needs him for the fight tomorrow.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.200
As long as this stays between us.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.120
Get in.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.800
You came to the guesthouse
yesterday evening.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.080
Something on your mind?

22:25.120 --> 22:27.920
Jeb Cornish was arrested on
a murder charge and we both know

22:27.960 --> 22:29.079
he didn't do it.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.480
So, you think I might have done it?

22:34.600 --> 22:38.039
I know that you were at the club

22:38.040 --> 22:39.720
the night he died.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.760
So, I bashed his brains and left
that there as evidence?

22:44.440 --> 22:46.400
That would have been foolish, yes.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.319
Look, I just offered to post Jeb's
bail 20 minutes ago.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.920
Released into custody of
a person of good character.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.080
So that counts me out.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.640
I put your name down
as his guarantor.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.160
We make a good team, Father Brown.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.520
I should use you more often.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.000
You've met my company lawyer, then?

23:25.200 --> 23:26.520
He said you wouldn't have a case.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.080
I don't need to remind you that
Jeb's still under caution.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.720
You're bailed to the care
of Father Brown.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.960
Yeah, well, Cheltenham Town Hall
is as far as he'll get.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.680
I will see you later.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.680
You'd better sign that paperwork.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.240
I'll see you outside in a moment.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.160
Dennis Nelson has long arms.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.320
Phone call from
a Councillor Boothby.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.760
Pulled some strings.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.400
This street-corner betting
on the fight...

24:04.440 --> 24:05.639
We turn a blind eye.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.680
Bigger things to worry about.

24:07.720 --> 24:12.400
Well, perhaps Jeb's promoter
has a conflict of interests...

24:13.600 --> 24:17.839
..bearing in mind his form
for racketeering.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.520
Funny you should say that.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.719
There's been a late run of money on
a knockout by Hoyle.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.480
Spread betting to ward off any
unwarranted attention.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.960
Jeb might be the favourite,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.880
but the smart money says
he's going to lose.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.280
No Teddy?

24:37.320 --> 24:38.599
He's already at the venue.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.200
Right, we'd better get a wiggle on.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.639
Did Roy Tomkins know about
you and Rita?

24:44.640 --> 24:47.080
You think I killed him to
keep him quiet?

24:47.120 --> 24:48.919
She's a dangerous woman to
fall in love with.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.216
You don't know her like I do.
If Dennis Nelson finds out...

24:51.240 --> 24:54.360
In case you hadn't noticed, Father,
I can take care of myself.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.280
Now if you don't mind,
I've got a fight to win.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.760
Thanks, Mr Nelson!

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
No more bets.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.479
COMMENTATOR: The atmosphere this
evening is electric -

25:21.480 --> 25:24.320
an impressive turnout to support
the local favourite.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.519
The inspector wants officers
outside the venue,

25:26.520 --> 25:29.520
just in case Cornish decides
to skip bail. Go on.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.760
Looking at the form book,
he's certainly the underdog.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.279
Didn't seem to bother Cornish in his
last fight at Wolverhampton.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.959
What made you change your mind?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.320
Needs must, when the devil drives.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.519
If Roy Tomkins was murdered by
the Mob,

25:41.520 --> 25:42.720
the Father could be next.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.920
Just giving the lad some space.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.600
Last few minutes, always the worst.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.480
Why didn't you tell me
the club was in trouble?

26:06.520 --> 26:07.480
It wasn't your concern.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.520
It is now.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.360
I ran up some debts.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.880
With a dubious line of credit.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.400
No wonder Dennis Nelson takes
such an interest.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.560
How much do you owe him?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.079
Enough.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
Enough to fix a fight?

26:24.360 --> 26:25.960
Keep your voice down,
will you, Father?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.439
Insider betting.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.920
Dennis Nelson is
set to make thousands...

26:31.280 --> 26:32.680
..as long as Jeb loses.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.600
He came to see me
the day before the weigh-in.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.520
The day Roy Tomkins died.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
Called in the loan.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.560
And made you an offer you
couldn't refuse.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.719
Like I said,

26:49.720 --> 26:51.240
you don't say no to Dennis Nelson.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
Is Jeb in on this?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.680
Course he isn't.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.520
You haven't told him, have you?

27:03.680 --> 27:06.440
At least let him hear it
from me, eh?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.120
Jeb...

27:12.320 --> 27:13.520
Jeb. Jeb, listen..

27:13.560 --> 27:16.360
You set me up! The one
person I trusted.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.800
Nelson set us both up.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.240
All you need to do is lose and
everybody wins.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.160
I don't take a dive for anyone.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.159
You're young.
There'll be other fights.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.359
Plenty more chances.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.360
What was it for, Teddy, eh?

27:29.400 --> 27:31.800
All the work we've put in!

27:31.840 --> 27:32.840
I didn't have a choice.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.399
There's always a choice.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.119
Look, I'm mobbed up.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.520
If there was any other way...

27:40.680 --> 27:41.840
You can't throw this fight...

27:41.880 --> 27:43.160
Please, please, Father.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.600
Just please keep out of it, eh?

27:44.640 --> 27:47.640
You can't throw this fight because
you are better than that.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.120
I believe you're a champion.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.920
Look, it's about survival.
Simple economics.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.399
We win the purse, we give Nelson
his cut.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.999
We're squared anyway,
we're laughing.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.320
That wasn't a punt Dennis was
prepared to take.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.360
He thinks Hoyle can beat you
on the square.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.200
And what about you, Teddy? Huh?

28:12.440 --> 28:14.679
I know you can take him.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.880
On your day.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.120
But this isn't your day, son.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.600
That's £500.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.680
Ten times
what you'd make on the fight.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.760
And what if I go to the police?

28:32.800 --> 28:35.160
He's already up on a murder charge.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.759
This could finish me off for good.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.080
I'm not going to throw the fight!

28:42.520 --> 28:45.159
Just dropped in to wish you
the best of luck.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.439
And, er, you might want to listen
to Teddy's advice.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.800
Ain't that right, Rita?

28:51.720 --> 28:53.680
Right then. We'll see you out there.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.920
Ringside.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.280
He knows.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.600
What?

29:12.360 --> 29:14.920
Have you been playing
around with Rita?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.239
Oh, you stupid little...!

29:16.240 --> 29:17.416
He treats her like he owns her.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.840
Well, maybe he does!

29:18.880 --> 29:20.280
Maybe he owns all of us.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.080
Do you want to end up like Roy?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.760
All right.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.280
I'll do it, but I'm doing
this for Rita.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.680
Oh, Jeb!

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
On one condition.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.040
I don't want you in my corner.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.640
I never want to see you again.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.880
Councillor Boothby, I don't believe
we've met.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.479
And this must be your lovely wife.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.560
Of course, you know Rita. Oh, yes.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.440
Quite a turnout, isn't it?

30:24.480 --> 30:26.919
Isn't it just? This is Mrs McCarthy.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.199
Father Brown's parish secretary.

30:29.200 --> 30:33.439
Cor, we'll have the Bishop down here
next and a couple of altar boys...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.119
Bit of a fight fan on the quiet.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.240
Oh, yeah?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.479
Well, you're in good company,
my dear.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.840
Somehow, I doubt that.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.760
That's the girl Jeb's sweet on.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.240
She wouldn't fool me
with her dubious charms.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.319
That "mink" stole
she's wearing is rabbit.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.120
Check out the shiner.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.840
Looks like she might be in trouble.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.400
RING ANNOUNCER: Fighting for the
vacant Southern Area Belt,

30:59.440 --> 31:02.319
with a record of 18 wins,

31:02.320 --> 31:07.280
two defeats and seven knockouts

31:07.320 --> 31:10.519
it's the Bethnal Green Bomber,

31:10.520 --> 31:13.440
Devon Hoyle!

31:15.720 --> 31:18.519
COMMENTATOR: And Hoyle heads into
the arena, looking fit,

31:18.520 --> 31:20.120
looking lean, looking mean.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.959
In the red corner...

31:25.960 --> 31:29.080
You need to get that money to Rita.
She knows where to meet me.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.280
You can't jump bail!

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
I vouched for you.

31:32.321 --> 31:34.279
You've got me all wrong then,
didn't you, Father?

31:34.280 --> 31:36.400
..the Chedworth Cyclone,
Jeb Cornish!

31:38.640 --> 31:39.920
CROWD CHEERING

31:46.160 --> 31:48.040
COMMENTATOR: Cornish taking the
fight to Hoyle

31:48.080 --> 31:49.319
from the opening bell.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.000
Hoyle keeping his distance from that
lethal right arm.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.440
Oh, a punishing one-two-three!

31:55.480 --> 31:57.480
Cornish reckless with his
early efforts.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.360
Smart jabs finding their mark.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.560
Without O'Connell in his corner,
well, right now,

32:14.600 --> 32:16.360
Cornish is on the wrong side
of this.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.000
35 years I've been in
the fight game. Mm.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.160
I tried to work with what I got.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.359
And then, once in a lifetime,

32:40.360 --> 32:41.560
someone special comes along.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.000
The one person that might make it
all worthwhile.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.440
And what did I do when he needed me
most?

32:52.400 --> 32:53.720
Sold him down the river.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.440
And for what?

32:58.040 --> 32:59.200
30 pieces of silver.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.200
We can still make this right.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.559
Clean, clever boxing from
Hoyle in this round.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.800
His well-drilled combinations
beginning to find their mark.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.960
Cornish is down, one knee
on the canvas.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.839
The referee steps in,

33:31.840 --> 33:34.760
the crowd are willing Cornish to
get back on his feet.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.440
Six, seven, eight...

33:38.680 --> 33:40.080
You good? You good?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.359
Desperate blocks from Cornish,

33:47.360 --> 33:49.759
hanging on for dear life.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.040
Oh, come on!

33:51.080 --> 33:52.919
At least make a fight out of it.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.680
Hoyle's running rings around him.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.799
Why isn't Teddy in his corner?

33:56.800 --> 34:00.920
And there's the bell and for Cornish
it couldn't come fast enough.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.439
And what in Heaven's name
has happened to Father Brown?

34:03.440 --> 34:06.640
Hoyle's well on top after these
early rounds.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.719
Sticking carefully to a game plan.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.679
Taking the fight to his opponent.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.360
And, so far, he hasn't looked
too troubled.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.478
I'm just going to powder my nose.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.799
Come here!

34:17.800 --> 34:19.880
We're going to watch him
lose together.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.319
This isn't a fight,
this is a beating.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.920
Frightened he's going to ruin
his pretty face?

34:23.960 --> 34:25.239
I know what you've been up to.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.998
I kept him amenable,
just like you asked me to.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.279
You've played me for a fool,
sweetheart.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.159
I hope he was worth it.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.320
Frankly, the home favourite looks
outclassed.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.998
Surely there's
no way back for Cornish?

34:40.000 --> 34:44.239
Hold on, I can see Cornish's trainer
back to the red corner.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.880
Well, this is a turn up!

34:45.920 --> 34:47.600
Where's he been?

34:47.639 --> 34:49.199
For once in your life,
you listen to me.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.480
You're the best bloody boxer
I've ever seen

34:53.520 --> 34:55.400
and we're going to win this
fight together,

34:55.440 --> 34:56.639
no matter what it costs us.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.519
Hey, now, concentrate.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.359
You can take him.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.839
He's wide open on the left.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.440
Wear him out, wait for an opening,

35:09.480 --> 35:11.480
just like I showed you.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.119
BELL RINGS

35:13.120 --> 35:15.679
Cornish steps out for round four.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.120
He's keen to get back into this.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.920
What's he playing at?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.120
Help me, please.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.840
He's looking like a fighter
transformed!

35:29.880 --> 35:32.880
Oh, there's some thrilling boxing
here from the Chedworth Cyclone.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.520
A beauty of a left hook that
sends Hoyle reeling.

35:42.840 --> 35:43.800
Come on, Jeb!

35:43.801 --> 35:44.960
He's not beaten yet.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.879
Not by a long shot.
You, you knock him in the ear!

35:48.880 --> 35:49.880
You stupid woman!

35:49.920 --> 35:52.119
You going to hit me, too? And me?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.720
Rita!

35:53.760 --> 35:54.760
Get after her!

35:58.400 --> 35:59.720
TEDDY: Come on, come on!

35:59.760 --> 36:01.720
One big punch you can take him
this round.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.880
Go on! Smash his filthy face in.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.520
COMMENTATOR: He's down!
Hoyle is down!

36:19.560 --> 36:21.040
The referee is counting him out.

36:21.080 --> 36:25.039
Four, five, six...

36:25.040 --> 36:27.240
I don't think he'll be getting up
from this one.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.080
..nine, ten!

36:31.320 --> 36:33.360
That's it! It's all over!

36:34.600 --> 36:38.200
The Cyclone wins by a fourth round
knockout! What a fight!

36:45.120 --> 36:47.960
Right, we've got to get you out
of here - quick!

36:48.000 --> 36:49.199
What about you?

36:49.200 --> 36:50.599
Don't worry about me.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.479
I'll deal with Dennis and
whatever comes my way.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.839
We did it, Ted.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.680
We showed them, didn't we?

36:56.720 --> 36:57.960
I always knew you would.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.360
I'll see you later, champ, eh?
Come on.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.120
Jeb wanted me to pass on a message.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.400
He's expecting to meet you later.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.840
Running off into the sunset
together?

37:32.880 --> 37:34.120
That was never going to happen.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.080
Black eye?

37:41.680 --> 37:43.320
Hmm.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.319
You were the insurance policy,

37:45.320 --> 37:46.360
in case Jeb didn't bite.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.360
Men only ever see what they want to.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.079
That money isn't yours to take.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.760
Seven years with Dennis?
I've earned it.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
What about Jeb?

37:58.080 --> 37:59.280
Jeb's too good for me.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.480
He deserves better.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.320
Rita, you both deserve better.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.599
He fell for a fantasy.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.200
A cheap blonde on the make.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.439
None of this is real.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.719
Redemption is real,
if you truly seek it.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.319
I'm touched by your faith in me,
Father,

38:13.320 --> 38:15.296
but I really don't have time for
a sermon right now.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.040
If you leave like this,

38:17.080 --> 38:18.640
the police will have nothing
on Dennis.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.400
I'll cut you a deal.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.000
Here's a diary of all of Dennis'
business dealings.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.720
Dates, names, enough to secure you
a conviction.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.560
You'll still need to testify.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.240
They'll have to find me first.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.120
My car's outside.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.479
I'm not leaving without Rita.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
She's already gone.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.400
Where is he?

38:55.440 --> 38:56.839
Somewhere you won't find him.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.360
You have made a big mistake.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.120
I think that there has been
enough violence.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.800
Get out. I might just forget
you're a priest.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.520
Isn't that just the measure
of the man?

39:08.560 --> 39:11.399
Dennis Nelson, I'm arresting you
for fraud...

39:11.400 --> 39:13.080
Oh, don't make me laugh.

39:13.120 --> 39:16.040
..wilful corruption of sporting
officials and perpetrating

39:16.080 --> 39:17.479
an illegal betting scam.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.360
If Scotland Yard can't put
anything on me,

39:19.400 --> 39:21.720
I don't rate the chances of some
village Bobby.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.200
Perhaps this might narrow the odds?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.600
I thought I might find you here
this morning.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.200
Yeah, I just needed some peace
and quiet.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.360
All that excitement.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.280
Eventful night.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.560
Aye.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.400
One of those nights
you'll always remember.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.000
There's a warrant out for Jeb's
arrest for violating

40:05.040 --> 40:06.679
the conditions of his bail.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.760
Well, Dennis is safely banged up.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.080
They'll soon pin the murder on him.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.160
I don't think Dennis Nelson
killed Roy.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.360
He's a piece of work.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.440
He's a proper villain.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.160
He came here,

40:22.200 --> 40:23.280
but you know that.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.320
Because you arranged to
meet him here.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.400
Is that when you set up the scam?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.760
Roy saw me take the money.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.920
He must have come back for
a few things.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.480
He knew you were setting up Jeb...

40:50.720 --> 40:53.520
Roy knew Dennis had form for
fixing the fights.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.600
He wanted a cut!

40:56.200 --> 40:58.120
Said we all owed him.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.720
I couldn't let him walk away.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.120
It was just the heat of the moment.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
It wasn't planned.

41:10.240 --> 41:14.079
You pushed his dead body down
the stairs

41:14.080 --> 41:16.320
to make it look like an accident.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.920
That took some planning.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.760
This club is my church, Father.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.200
Where would those lads be
if this closes?

41:27.320 --> 41:28.440
Back on the street.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.880
I did it to protect them.

41:33.400 --> 41:37.360
You did it to protect your own
self-interest.

41:40.920 --> 41:46.120
And now, perhaps, you might like
to make penance

41:46.160 --> 41:49.000
in your church,

41:49.040 --> 41:51.200
before you confess to
Inspector Mallory.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.960
Well, I've got a feeling
that she's not coming.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.560
She'll be here.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.560
All right, time for a pep talk.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.559
There are certain kinds of women -
Mrs M would call them fast -

42:15.560 --> 42:18.680
they really can't be trusted,
and men like you never tend

42:18.720 --> 42:21.560
to see them coming,
so then they take advantage.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.679
Thanks for the lift,
you're a life-saver.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.480
I thought you'd stood me up.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.840
Can't a girl be fashionably late?

42:36.960 --> 42:38.360
Oh, ye of little faith.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.160
Shall we? Yes.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.800
Father,
will you give us your blessing?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.000
God be with you.

43:06.440 --> 43:07.440
Presbytery?

43:08.480 --> 43:09.520
Red Lion.
