00:31.966 --> 00:33.568
Sir, here's your beverage.

00:35.337 --> 00:36.470
Ok.

00:41.944 --> 00:42.989
We're almost home.

00:43.713 --> 00:44.832
Yeah.

01:02.321 --> 01:04.532
I am so sorry to
bother you Mr. Shepard.

01:04.599 --> 01:09.528
But we're so excited to have you on board.
Would you mind signing your book for me?

01:09.764 --> 01:13.216
Um, I didn't write that, April here did.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.563
Um, would you mind?

01:15.633 --> 01:18.612
The read is truly riveting.

01:18.950 --> 01:23.708
I mean, what you did is just
incredible. You're a hero.

01:25.790 --> 01:26.994
Thank you.

01:27.062 --> 01:28.437
Really.

01:32.739 --> 01:36.133
We're actually having a signing in New
York on Saturday if you'd like to come.

01:36.181 --> 01:38.359
Really? You're inviting me?

01:38.428 --> 01:42.365
Thank you so much! And again, we're
so honored to have you both on board.

01:42.384 --> 01:43.689
Have a nice flight.

01:47.885 --> 01:49.878
Fin, why aren't you
having more fun with this?

01:50.700 --> 01:51.656
Come on, April.

01:52.978 --> 01:53.976
Two of my friends were killed.

01:54.053 --> 01:55.839
I almost destroyed Los Angeles.

01:55.895 --> 01:57.035
And oh yeah...

01:57.103 --> 01:58.146
I got eaten by a shark.

01:59.248 --> 02:01.021
How much fun do you think that was?

02:02.334 --> 02:03.136
I'm sorry, I...

02:03.204 --> 02:05.953
No. I'm sorry.

02:06.121 --> 02:07.762
It's just...

02:09.039 --> 02:10.707
All this attention is crazy.

02:10.848 --> 02:12.282
That never used to bother you before.

02:12.357 --> 02:13.886
Yeah but this is...

02:14.236 --> 02:15.534
It's different.

02:16.211 --> 02:18.086
Well think of it like a vacation.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.820
You're gonna go home and
you're gonna see your sister...

02:20.855 --> 02:22.533
and your brother in law.

02:27.266 --> 02:29.583
Why don't you two just work it out?

02:31.394 --> 02:33.660
You know what? Right
now, I think I'd rather

02:33.661 --> 02:37.639
just focus on the hot
slice of New York pizza.

03:01.179 --> 03:03.310
I'm gonna wash my face.

03:50.367 --> 03:53.056
- Are you ok? You sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

03:53.089 --> 03:54.500
Yeah.

04:14.763 --> 04:15.852
Are you sure you're ok?

04:15.872 --> 04:18.154
I'll be alright.

04:19.735 --> 04:24.138
This is Captain Bob Wilson,
we will be starting our decent into

04:24.174 --> 04:29.012
New York shortly. I just want to say
thank you for flying Santa Mira Airlines.

04:29.045 --> 04:31.329
It's a perfect way to fly.

04:31.412 --> 04:32.160
What did you have?

04:32.233 --> 04:33.612
The chicken.

04:33.646 --> 04:36.237
Chicken? I was going to try the
fish but the chicken looked good.

04:36.271 --> 04:38.355
Always Chicken on a plane.

04:50.268 --> 04:54.133
Ladies and Gentlemen, as we
begin our final decent we expect

04:54.168 --> 04:57.533
to hit a bit of turbulence so
please fasten your seat belts.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.110
I like how you say a little bit.

05:02.146 --> 05:03.794
This is a lot of bit.

05:03.829 --> 05:06.442
- Oh this is not that much.
- Yeah?

05:06.443 --> 05:08.223
We just want to make sure
everybody is going to stay in their seats

05:08.240 --> 05:11.767
and not bounce around. No
lawsuits on my flights.

05:11.802 --> 05:13.415
No sir.

05:17.996 --> 05:22.063
Don't worry. This is
nothing. Oh I've flown worse.

05:33.438 --> 05:35.804
Flight attendant! Flight attendant!
There's something on the wing.

05:36.301 --> 05:37.191
There's something on the wing!

05:37.481 --> 05:38.287
Did you see that?

05:39.730 --> 05:40.705
What do you see?

05:41.683 --> 05:42.518
I got...

05:47.708 --> 05:50.280
Mr. Shepard, you
need to relax.  Really.

05:50.299 --> 05:54.321
You guys are all experiencing normal
turbulence. There's nothing to worry about.

05:56.893 --> 05:59.195
Are you ok, Mr. Shepard?

06:00.300 --> 06:01.634
You need to calm down.

06:04.408 --> 06:07.143
I can't have you disturbing
the rest of the passengers.

06:07.177 --> 06:08.913
You got it?

06:09.682 --> 06:10.784
Ok.

06:10.818 --> 06:12.621
Ok, I get it.

06:12.654 --> 06:14.355
I'm good.

06:17.698 --> 06:19.366
I'm alright.

06:21.604 --> 06:24.140
Fin, what do you see?

06:24.776 --> 06:26.545
It's happening again.

06:30.452 --> 06:32.522
Whoa! Did you see that?

06:32.556 --> 06:35.293
- It looks like a bird.
- No it's a bat.
- No it's a bird.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.468
- No, it's a bat!
- No it's a bird!

06:57.467 --> 07:00.506
Flame on number 2, Captain.
I think we've been hit!

07:02.508 --> 07:07.149
Mayday Mayday Mayday. It's flight
2-0-9. We've lost engine number 2.

07:07.185 --> 07:09.720
Request emergency clearance into JFK.

07:09.755 --> 07:12.325
We're descending rapidly to 20,000 feet.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.401
Jonni check number 3.
It's running a little hot.

07:19.402 --> 07:20.449
Yes.

07:27.419 --> 07:28.253
What the?

07:28.287 --> 07:30.223
I've never seen anything like this.

07:30.282 --> 07:33.085
<i>Flight 209. Please report
what is causing the disturbance.</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:35.005
<i>Repeat, what is
causing the disturbance?</i>

07:35.434 --> 07:38.003
Captain, we've gotta
tell them something.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.198
And tell 'em what?

07:57.182 --> 07:59.677
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.645
I'm gonna check
those galley panels.

08:09.761 --> 08:10.563
Ok.

08:10.564 --> 08:12.463
<i>Flight 209, what is your problem?</i>

08:17.409 --> 08:20.853
<i>Come in Flight 209!
Flight 209!  Come in!</i>

08:21.054 --> 08:24.714
<i>Come in!  Are you there Flight 209?
What is your problem?</i>

08:29.396 --> 08:30.791
<i>209 come in!</i>

08:55.574 --> 08:56.810
Fin!

09:24.126 --> 09:27.084
Just hold on everybody!
Hold on!

09:33.408 --> 09:34.777
Just hold on!

09:44.295 --> 09:46.331
Fin!

09:52.574 --> 09:53.609
Just hold on!

09:53.644 --> 09:55.312
Just hold on! I'm almost there!

10:18.487 --> 10:22.627
This is flight 2-0-9!
The pilots are dead!

10:22.661 --> 10:23.705
I see the runway!

10:24.772 --> 10:27.216
I'm going to put down the landing
gear and heading for it!

10:27.251 --> 10:28.691
Clear out the runway!

10:28.725 --> 10:30.315
I'm coming in hot!

10:49.199 --> 10:52.013
Shark! Shark!

10:52.919 --> 10:54.761
Grab my gun!

10:58.715 --> 11:00.725
Behind you!

11:07.695 --> 11:09.673
My hand! My hand!

12:04.260 --> 12:05.375
Oh, my God.

12:06.378 --> 12:07.341
Oh man.

12:18.793 --> 12:20.469
Welcome to New York.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.474
<i>This weather is driving me crazy!</i>

13:33.575 --> 13:36.100
One minute it's hot, the
next minute it's cold...

13:36.108 --> 13:38.609
Hot, cold, hot, cold,
wake up your mind!

13:38.644 --> 13:42.072
- Maybe you should pull your skirt down.
- Ok you use to wear short

13:42.106 --> 13:45.434
skirts before you got old.

13:46.179 --> 13:49.446
You know, the weather is crazy
though. I hope it doesn't rain today.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.298
Alright the ferry to
Liberty Island is on time,

13:51.299 --> 13:53.853
the game hasn't been canceled,
there's nothing to worry about.

13:53.854 --> 13:55.844
- Perfect. Alright, great so you guys have
- Yep.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.659
a good time. Don't forget to meet us
at April and Fin's hotel for dinner, ok?

13:59.692 --> 14:01.607
Please don't lose the address.

14:01.642 --> 14:02.853
It's right here,

14:02.886 --> 14:05.070
What if something
happens to your phone?

14:05.105 --> 14:09.005
That's what I got my boy for. Photographic
memory, keen sense of direction,

14:09.040 --> 14:10.787
part blood hound from
your side of the family.

14:10.822 --> 14:11.931
Alright. Yeah...

14:11.966 --> 14:15.730
Oh and hey, Please don't hide
from my bother tonight, ok?

14:15.764 --> 14:18.858
I don't hide from him, I just
don't think he's ever uh...

14:18.892 --> 14:20.774
forgiving me for hooking up with...

14:20.807 --> 14:23.196
Ok, gross! You cannot say that!

14:23.230 --> 14:24.940
I think I recall me
hooking up with you...

14:24.967 --> 14:25.743
Nope!

14:26.156 --> 14:30.189
Either way, it was the
end of the dynamic duo.

14:30.223 --> 14:32.579
And which one of you
was the Boy Wonder?

14:32.715 --> 14:35.299
I thought I was Batman.

14:35.301 --> 14:36.683
Yeah, I love you. Bye.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.187
Have fun you guys, ok?

14:38.320 --> 14:41.057
- See you guys later, be safe!
- Be good.

14:41.735 --> 14:44.264
Come on, let's get there early, maybe
we can catch a little batting practice?

14:44.298 --> 14:46.156
You think David Wright is
gonna hit a homer today?

14:46.193 --> 14:48.825
Maybe, he's been roping them lately.

14:48.859 --> 14:51.017
Do you remember what
you promised this time?

14:51.053 --> 14:54.700
Alright alright, I'm turning
it off. No more work, alright?

14:54.734 --> 14:57.638
All play all day. Me and
you. Let's go. Come on.

14:59.562 --> 15:03.403
We have some new developments
right now on a 747 that made an

15:03.441 --> 15:05.942
emergency landing at
JFK airport this morning.

15:05.977 --> 15:07.835
It happened at 7:33.

15:07.869 --> 15:11.211
We're told it was a Santa
Mira Airlines flight 209.

15:11.248 --> 15:13.980
Reports that we're getting
say it hit turbulence

15:14.016 --> 15:17.086
on it's decent, and that
a passenger actually aided

15:17.219 --> 15:19.324
in the safe landing of that plane.

15:19.359 --> 15:21.711
The plane flew into some
kind of crazy weather pattern.

15:22.085 --> 15:24.414
And a shark got
sucked up into the engine.

15:26.196 --> 15:27.161
That's hard to believe.

15:27.295 --> 15:29.357
Hard to believe that a storm
bigger than anything you've ever

15:29.492 --> 15:31.587
seen before is about to hit
Manhattan? Well guess what?

15:31.723 --> 15:33.426
It's about to happen,
so here's the deal...

15:33.561 --> 15:35.509
You need to lock down the city.

15:35.544 --> 15:38.291
You need to call the Mayor and have
him put the National Guard on alert.

15:38.326 --> 15:41.439
Get helicopters in the air with firebombs
so they can throw them into the tornado.

15:41.475 --> 15:43.318
Ok, I can see you're upset...

15:43.353 --> 15:44.368
I'm not crazy.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.232
You gotta alert the city.

15:46.566 --> 15:49.252
People have to know the
truth before it happens again.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.725
Mr. Shepard, we're ready to go.

15:56.653 --> 15:58.280
Mr. Shepard,
do you have a comment?

15:58.316 --> 16:01.054
No I don't have a comment!
Get that camera outta my face!

16:03.743 --> 16:05.260
Move out of the way!

16:05.295 --> 16:06.639
<i>Security can you grab these.</i>

16:07.481 --> 16:09.396
It's gonna be ok.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.205
Stay with me.

16:14.981 --> 16:16.632
There you go.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.058
Oh, no, no, sweetie, you can't in there.

16:18.093 --> 16:20.369
She's lost a lot of blood.
But, she's gonna be ok.

16:20.404 --> 16:21.115
She's in good hands.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.233
I'll let you know as
soon as there's any news.

16:23.268 --> 16:25.978
Can you just wait over here?
I'll be back, I promise.

16:26.013 --> 16:28.410
<i>Dr. Hardman
please report to Trauma C.</i>

16:28.858 --> 16:32.788
<i>Dr. Hardman please report to Trauma C.</i>

16:33.752 --> 16:36.612
<i>Yes, Well did you
notice how tall I was today?</i>

16:36.647 --> 16:38.808
But-but they look
good. I like the hot red.

16:38.843 --> 16:42.717
Yes. Thank you very much. Just for
you. I actually wore them today for

16:42.752 --> 16:46.277
who was suppose to be our first
guest, you know April Wexler

16:46.311 --> 16:49.284
was suppose to be here. She
wrote this incredible book:

16:49.318 --> 16:51.998
How to survive a Sharknado.

16:55.453 --> 16:58.787
- You know what but her plane...
- Very scary.

16:58.822 --> 17:00.881
Her plane had an
emergency landing at JFK.

17:00.913 --> 17:03.234
I know. It's a scary thing, so...

17:03.239 --> 17:04.964
And we don't know the
status of the plane, so

17:04.964 --> 17:06.962
we're-our prayers are
with her, her family, and

17:06.996 --> 17:09.122
- all the other passengers.
- Of course Fin, her husband.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.781
Fin, her husband and all
the other passengers on Flight 209.

17:13.273 --> 17:15.204
<i>Notice for Dr.
Courtice. Please report to trauma.</i>

17:15.237 --> 17:17.983
<i>Notice for Dr. Courtice.
Please report to trauma.</i>

17:18.015 --> 17:20.565
Mr. Wexler?

17:20.598 --> 17:21.577
Shepard.

17:21.613 --> 17:23.083
Mr. Shepard.

17:23.116 --> 17:24.357
We're divorced.

17:24.394 --> 17:26.516
Is... April ok?

17:26.550 --> 17:27.726
She's going to survive.

17:28.031 --> 17:30.571
We were able to salvage some of the limb.

17:30.604 --> 17:33.008
In time, she should be able
to make a full recovery.

17:33.043 --> 17:34.678
Is she a fighter?

17:34.713 --> 17:36.617
Yeah, yeah she's a fighter.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.887
How much recovery time
are we talking about?

17:38.922 --> 17:40.925
Varies with different patients.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.696
Prosthetics have come
a long way these days...

17:42.731 --> 17:46.303
I mean, with a little time,
rehabilitation she'll be able to

17:46.337 --> 17:48.809
do a lot more then she thinks she can.

17:49.010 --> 17:50.446
She's going to be waking up soon.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.316
Let's get you to her room.

18:06.348 --> 18:07.983
It's pretty cool, huh?

18:08.018 --> 18:10.890
I first visited the statue of
liberty when I was your age.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.967
I've never realized she had feet before.

18:12.995 --> 18:15.518
It's actually very
interesting, the broken shackles

18:15.544 --> 18:17.604
around her ankles are about her being free

18:17.638 --> 18:21.679
and moving forward, and
lighting the path to freedom.

18:21.714 --> 18:25.087
Yeah, you just read that out
of the pamphlet, didn't you?

18:36.913 --> 18:38.182
Hey.

18:38.216 --> 18:39.951
Hey baby.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.256
Fin.

18:42.625 --> 18:45.096
Hey, you're going to be ok.

18:45.565 --> 18:47.468
Am I?

18:52.213 --> 18:53.213
The shark...

18:53.214 --> 18:55.218
kept chasing me.

18:55.251 --> 18:58.124
And it had this huge scar across its face.

18:58.158 --> 19:02.901
And I shot him in the
eye. But it took my hand.

19:02.935 --> 19:06.976
It's like, he knew who I was.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.549
No, he didn't know you.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.055
If he did, he would have ran the other way.

19:12.089 --> 19:14.159
I'm sure about that.

19:19.771 --> 19:22.276
Why did you marry me?

19:27.487 --> 19:30.928
Because I wasn't perfect
and you didn't care.

19:32.298 --> 19:34.669
You love me anyway.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.913
Now...

19:40.048 --> 19:42.185
You're gonna get passed that.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.591
We're gonna get passed this.

19:46.027 --> 19:51.706
But next time you offer to lend a
hand, don't be so literal about it.

19:53.181 --> 19:56.424
<i>We have a
monster storm headed to New York City.</i>

19:56.450 --> 19:58.820
<i>Let me show you exactly
what I'm talking about here.</i>

19:58.855 --> 20:01.543
We have that southerly
shark wind that's going

20:01.569 --> 20:03.831
to be pushing all the water north bound

20:03.865 --> 20:07.573
so we could see significant damage to
homes that are right along the coast

20:07.607 --> 20:09.488
and then we have to worry about...

20:09.511 --> 20:12.019
Not again.

20:15.961 --> 20:17.731
There she is.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.435
Lady liberty.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.305
- It's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

20:21.339 --> 20:23.142
Here. Let's take a picture.

20:24.513 --> 20:25.435
Got it.

20:25.449 --> 20:27.453
Mmmm!

20:27.587 --> 20:28.488
Ellen!

20:28.521 --> 20:31.293
Polly! Chrissie!

20:31.328 --> 20:36.505
- Oh the crew!
- Oh my God. Hot mama.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.445
Wow! Look at you all grown up.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.493
You better be careful Ellen. This one
looks like she's going to be trouble.

20:42.518 --> 20:44.054
- Yeah I know.
- As somebody else we use to know.

20:44.089 --> 20:47.060
- Alright. Ok. Zip it.
- Mmhmm.

20:47.095 --> 20:49.031
I was so worried you
wouldn't able to make it.

20:49.066 --> 20:50.227
Is your brother ok though?

20:50.235 --> 20:51.871
Yeah, he's ok. Why?

20:51.906 --> 20:53.574
There was a crash at JFK.

20:53.610 --> 20:54.811
What? What crash?

20:54.845 --> 20:55.927
It's all over the news.

20:55.947 --> 20:57.350
Oh my God, I got to call him.

20:57.384 --> 20:58.819
I'm sure he's fine.

20:58.854 --> 21:00.257
Ok, well call him.

21:00.290 --> 21:01.859
He called like 14 times.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.171
Ellen. I've been trying
to reach you all morning.

21:07.205 --> 21:09.041
Oh my gosh Fin, are you ok?

21:09.076 --> 21:12.147
Yeah I'm fine but April is in
the hospital. She's gonna be ok though.

21:12.182 --> 21:14.520
- Oh my God that's horrible.
- What? What's happening?

21:14.554 --> 21:16.223
April was in an accident. Everybody's ok.

21:16.257 --> 21:17.993
You've got to get back
to Manhattan right away.

21:18.029 --> 21:20.566
Of course, we'll come right away.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.571
Look, the ferry runs every half hour.

21:22.604 --> 21:23.940
Did you hear that?

21:23.974 --> 21:25.777
No, you can't wait half an
hour. The storm is coming fast,

21:25.811 --> 21:26.912
you need to get out of there now!

21:26.947 --> 21:28.716
Well, I'll try. How am I gonna do that?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.398
Call the port authority.
Call the fire department.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.690
Call anyone that's gonna listen to you.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.028
You get back to Manhattan now!

21:34.062 --> 21:36.266
Mom, Dad's phone keeps going to voice-mail.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.635
My God.

21:37.670 --> 21:40.742
Fin listen to me, Martin and
Vaughn they're at the Mets game, ok?

21:40.777 --> 21:42.579
I don't know, Martin's phone
must be dead or something but,

21:42.614 --> 21:45.218
could you try to get to them?

21:45.254 --> 21:47.690
I don't have a ticket. How
am I going to find them?

21:47.725 --> 21:49.367
I sent April a ticket even though I

21:49.395 --> 21:52.000
didn't think you were going to use it.

21:53.470 --> 21:57.177
Listen, that ballpark
is right on the river.

21:57.213 --> 21:59.716
It'll be the first place it hits.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.185
Go.

22:01.221 --> 22:03.024
Save them.

22:03.058 --> 22:05.329
I'll be ok.

22:08.836 --> 22:10.573
Alright, I'll go.

22:10.607 --> 22:12.110
Thanks Fin.

22:12.144 --> 22:13.947
We'll meet you at the hotel.

22:13.982 --> 22:15.324
Hotel. Copy that.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.378
What's gonna hit?

22:19.464 --> 22:21.584
You stay out of trouble.

22:21.619 --> 22:24.669
I'm the one who's suppose
to be saying that to you.

22:32.531 --> 22:35.116
You stay out of trouble.

22:37.975 --> 22:39.396
What's going to hit?

22:41.926 --> 22:43.628
You guys.

22:48.752 --> 22:49.787
Mom, what's going on?

22:50.992 --> 22:52.925
Since when are there sharks in Manhattan?

22:55.045 --> 22:57.277
You should probably ask my brother.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.340
<i>Ah we're going to take
a look at the weather right now. I have</i>

23:02.341 --> 23:06.706
never in 56 years seen a weather pattern
like the one we've had this summer here.

23:06.707 --> 23:10.448
Matt, this is nuts. We've already had
record breaking heat. Now we're talking

23:10.449 --> 23:13.443
- about the potential of snow fall.
- Snow in July.

23:13.470 --> 23:14.404
I know!

23:14.777 --> 23:17.255
It sounds like a joke.
It is not my friends.

23:17.393 --> 23:20.059
We have this arctic air
mass. It's coming in.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.818
It's going to bring at
least 3 to 4 inches of snow.

23:22.829 --> 23:24.759
Making it's way through the outer burrows

23:24.792 --> 23:27.277
and parts of Northwestern
New Jersey. Same time,

23:27.312 --> 23:29.744
a massive low pressure system developing

23:29.779 --> 23:32.825
it's going to bring wind. And it
is going to bring torrential rains.

23:32.860 --> 23:35.600
So we are looking at a convergence
zone right over Manhattan...

23:35.635 --> 23:39.127
that is gonna bring weather
you've never seen before, Matt.

23:39.162 --> 23:40.637
<i>This is unprecedented.</i>

23:40.672 --> 23:42.261
<i>All you can do is just shake your head, Al.</i>

23:42.296 --> 23:43.980
<i>Thank very much, and
Al's gonna bring us the</i>

23:44.015 --> 23:47.016
<i>latest developments on this
bizarre weather, as they come in.</i>

23:47.719 --> 23:49.042
Martin it's Fin.

23:49.077 --> 23:52.171
When you get this message call me back
on my cell phone. Coming to get you.

23:52.406 --> 23:55.533
If we don't connect, you've got to get
back to Manhattan as soon as you can.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.931
Hey, you know I recognize you.

23:59.967 --> 24:03.384
You're that guy that got eaten by the
great white and lived to tell about it.

24:03.386 --> 24:04.761
How you doing?

24:04.796 --> 24:06.605
Why do you think I picked you up?

24:06.639 --> 24:09.288
This storm is gonna be a real ass kicker.

24:09.323 --> 24:12.819
The other day, trashcans kept flying of
the street, and hit me on the windshield.

24:12.843 --> 24:16.529
Take a look at that. Ah.
Almost crapped on my pants.

24:16.564 --> 24:17.838
I got to get to the ballpark.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.447
What? Baseball today?

24:19.481 --> 24:23.067
You're lucky if they
come out of the club house today.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.650
It's not baseball I'm worried about.

24:27.626 --> 24:30.065
<i>Hey Nathan Fast here on WTHS!</i>

24:30.072 --> 24:32.147
<i>Next up, we're gonna
talk about the crazy</i>

24:32.182 --> 24:36.009
<i>weather happening here in New York
City. Looks like quite the storm brewing.</i>

24:53.731 --> 24:56.551
That's how you hit the ball.
You see it and you whack it!

24:56.585 --> 24:58.902
I don't know how they're
playing like this. It's so cold.

24:58.936 --> 25:00.628
It's getting colder out here, man.

25:00.649 --> 25:04.473
<i>Yeah, I guess Fin is too Mr. California
to come to Queens to hang for a game.</i>

25:04.509 --> 25:06.087
- Right.
- Too bad.

25:06.119 --> 25:07.594
Yeah, love the way
they're hitting today.

25:07.629 --> 25:09.442
Just like old times, right?

25:09.477 --> 25:12.968
Yeah well, me and Vaughn are
starting to uh... family tradition.

25:13.002 --> 25:15.623
I dig it. Yeah, I don't
think Fin is gonna bite.

25:15.657 --> 25:17.971
You guys gotta... work
your beef out somehow.

25:18.005 --> 25:19.987
Well, he's super Fin.
Let him work it out.

25:20.021 --> 25:24.351
Guys, maybe Fin doesn't remember where
we're sitting. I'm gonna go look for him.

25:24.386 --> 25:25.627
Alright.

25:25.929 --> 25:27.340
He'll find us.

25:27.373 --> 25:29.117
If he shows up.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.114
What's the hold up?
Why we slowing down.

25:50.139 --> 25:51.245
Traffic.

25:51.279 --> 25:52.385
This is New York you know.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.367
Hey look Bud, there's
gotta be some back way.

25:54.403 --> 25:56.482
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
keep your money.

25:56.517 --> 25:59.233
I'll get you there somehow.

26:08.704 --> 26:10.725
Just um, just
answer me one question, ok?

26:12.075 --> 26:14.735
What does the inside
of a shark smell like?

26:16.351 --> 26:18.810
There's no words
to describe that, pal.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.132
I don't know, I always
thought it would smell like...

26:21.167 --> 26:22.244
Chicken.

26:24.097 --> 26:25.073
No.

26:25.108 --> 26:28.072
Or smell like Salmon or Cod.

26:34.168 --> 26:36.725
Hey.
Looks like the ferry's there.

26:42.486 --> 26:43.965
Let's go.

27:01.583 --> 27:04.181
Hey can I get 4 hot dogs
and 3 chips for the girls?

27:04.617 --> 27:05.421
Thank you.

27:12.193 --> 27:14.043
Harland "The Blaster" McGuinness?

27:15.463 --> 27:16.410
Quiet.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.208
Jesus.
It's you.

27:18.693 --> 27:23.069
7 time all-star 2nd basemen.
285 career batting average.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.728
15 years Mets manager.

27:25.564 --> 27:27.366
What are you doing waiting
in line getting a dog here?

27:27.450 --> 27:30.213
Why aren't you in the VIP section,
getting all that free food?

27:31.124 --> 27:31.994
Want to hear a story?

27:32.469 --> 27:33.348
Yeah.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.175
About 25 years ago, man just like this...

27:37.210 --> 27:39.834
It's my last time at bat.

27:39.857 --> 27:41.138
You remember?

27:43.563 --> 27:45.928
Yeah.
You struck out pretty bad.

27:48.847 --> 27:50.038
My dad...

27:50.673 --> 27:53.982
Sitting down there, section C
seat 117 and I let him down.

27:54.517 --> 27:55.921
It's good seats.

27:56.935 --> 27:59.760
It's my last time at bat
and all I wanted to do...

28:00.382 --> 28:02.858
was to hit a home run for my pops.

28:04.401 --> 28:06.539
Still feel him watching over me.

28:07.846 --> 28:09.095
This game.

28:09.630 --> 28:12.851
Once it's in your blood,
never leaves.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.898
That's a bummer man.

28:26.261 --> 28:27.695
Hey, hey. Hey!

28:27.730 --> 28:28.750
Yeah?

28:29.130 --> 28:33.060
Hey listen, if you ever need a cab again,
I'm Ben. Just call me. I'll be there.

28:33.061 --> 28:34.309
I'm also an actor.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.312
I can play you. If they
ever do a movie of your life.

28:37.347 --> 28:40.925
If anyone's playing me in
a movie, it's gonna be me.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.541
Not a bad idea.

28:52.306 --> 28:55.049
The breakthrough in modern
prosthetics has been amazing.

28:55.050 --> 28:57.283
It feels like it's still there.

28:57.284 --> 29:01.450
It's called phantom limbs.  It's a very
common sensation in injuries like yours.

29:01.651 --> 29:03.355
How are you feeling Miss Wexler?

29:04.356 --> 29:05.664
It hurts.

29:05.665 --> 29:08.252
- Should I increase your medication?
- No.

29:10.053 --> 29:12.382
But it might get weird if you do.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.279
Dang ya!

29:17.411 --> 29:18.447
I got to get out of here.

29:18.481 --> 29:19.713
I'll move you to a different room.

29:19.748 --> 29:22.488
No, I got to get out of the
hospital. I gotta go find Fin.

29:22.524 --> 29:23.756
Is he in the storm?

29:23.792 --> 29:26.874
Ma'am, you've just came out
of surgery after a major trauma.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.827
You're in no condition to leave.

29:28.863 --> 29:29.629
You need rest.

29:29.907 --> 29:32.597
<i>Attention all personnel,
we are evacuating the East Wing</i>

29:32.620 --> 29:35.313
<i>immediately. Patients please
remain in your rooms...</i>

29:35.402 --> 29:36.219
I'll be right back.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.901
<i>Hospital personnel will assist you.</i>

30:02.179 --> 30:04.033
Fin!

30:04.068 --> 30:05.924
Hey there.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.126
Skye?

30:07.161 --> 30:08.500
Yeah.

30:08.535 --> 30:10.872
I haven't seen
you since graduation.

30:11.908 --> 30:13.121
Yeah.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.413
What are you doing here?

30:15.450 --> 30:17.891
I was hoping that you'd come.

30:17.928 --> 30:20.645
Everyone in the neighborhood
still talks about you.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.290
You look great.

30:25.325 --> 30:26.877
You do too.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.271
I forgot to give you something
the last time I saw you.

30:29.747 --> 30:32.054
What was that?

30:37.961 --> 30:39.390
Wow, um...

30:40.541 --> 30:41.502
I'm with April.

30:42.375 --> 30:43.380
Your cheerleader?

30:44.243 --> 30:45.339
I thought you divorced.

30:45.827 --> 30:50.123
Uh, yeah well its... its complicated.
We're uh... we're working through it.

30:50.208 --> 30:51.082
Yeah.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.160
It's cool.

30:54.212 --> 30:55.168
Where the guys?

30:55.211 --> 30:58.601
Umm... section 112, row 22.

31:04.119 --> 31:05.647
Ladies and
Gentlemen it looks like

31:05.648 --> 31:07.729
we are going to
have a little rain delay.

31:07.831 --> 31:08.675
How you doing?

31:08.807 --> 31:10.533
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey Fin!
- Hey!

31:10.568 --> 31:11.460
Hey Bryan!

31:11.711 --> 31:13.620
- You 2 guys, hug it out.
- Yeah.

31:13.806 --> 31:16.097
Vaughn?
Man you got big.

31:16.736 --> 31:17.893
You haven't seen him in a while.

31:17.929 --> 31:20.483
- They grow like weeds.
- Yeah they do.

31:20.542 --> 31:22.110
Look, I don't know if you
guys heard but we had to make

31:22.130 --> 31:23.685
an emergency landing at the airport.

31:23.977 --> 31:24.860
Is April ok?

31:24.862 --> 31:27.933
She's gonna be fine. But Ellen sent me
to get you. We gotta get out of here.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.305
There's a storm coming. It's
gonna hit and it's gonna hit hard.

31:30.446 --> 31:33.025
We gotta get out of here
before the river overflows.

31:38.179 --> 31:39.828
Nah, this rain delay is
gonna be over in a minutes..

31:39.864 --> 31:41.828
No trust me, we gotta get
out of here now. Come on!

31:41.829 --> 31:45.916
Ladies and Gentlemen. Due
to snow, the game has been canceled.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.795
Let's go. Let's go!

32:03.476 --> 32:04.806
Grab something!

32:16.481 --> 32:17.661
Whew. Batter up!

32:43.659 --> 32:46.138
You alright?
Okay, go go go!

33:18.733 --> 33:21.861
- This is happening here.
- It could be happening to Ellen and Mora.

33:22.563 --> 33:23.568
That was a good game!

33:23.603 --> 33:25.105
We were winning!

33:36.926 --> 33:39.126
Come on! Come on! This way.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.390
It's alright, the 7
train is always running.

33:49.425 --> 33:50.854
I'm not getting through.

33:50.989 --> 33:51.879
Me neither.

33:52.214 --> 33:53.951
We gotta get to the Bales Tower.

33:53.986 --> 33:55.614
We gotta go home.
Take Mora home.

33:55.649 --> 33:57.820
No, Bales Tower that's
were she said to meet us.

33:57.855 --> 34:00.082
She's gonna go through Manhattan
anyway. We're going there.

34:01.217 --> 34:02.200
Dad.

34:02.635 --> 34:04.314
If mom made a plan...

34:04.449 --> 34:05.552
Stick to it.

34:05.587 --> 34:06.784
Alright. Alright.

34:07.419 --> 34:08.952
Alright.

34:17.454 --> 34:19.300
Come on. Let's go.

34:25.846 --> 34:27.505
The tunnel better not be flooded.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.293
The trains wouldn't
be running if they were.

34:30.328 --> 34:31.289
Let's hope you're right.

34:48.594 --> 34:49.783
Awe, Lou?

34:51.498 --> 34:52.774
Bad news.

34:52.809 --> 34:54.900
Yeah, you think they
would have fixed it from

34:54.935 --> 34:56.719
all the flooding we
had from the last storm.

34:56.754 --> 34:58.200
Yeah, you think.

34:58.235 --> 35:00.993
Dispatch, we're on location.
Confirm flooding.

35:01.028 --> 35:03.380
We're going in to
shut the valves off.

35:30.289 --> 35:31.674
There's more of them!

35:32.227 --> 35:34.161
They're getting closer!

35:36.164 --> 35:38.596
We need to move the boat faster!

35:41.502 --> 35:42.959
So many of them.

36:02.915 --> 36:03.828
No!

36:27.743 --> 36:29.931
Thanks Fin.

36:29.967 --> 36:31.533
Thanks for getting us outta there.

36:33.975 --> 36:35.963
No, I mean it.

36:35.997 --> 36:40.176
Vaughn... my boy
could have been killed.

36:53.877 --> 36:56.018
- Hey, how's your kid?
- He's alright.

36:56.330 --> 37:00.546
- Did he figure out who the father was?
- Yeah, you're really funny, guy.

37:00.547 --> 37:02.343
Yeah, it was your last chance.

37:02.898 --> 37:04.720
Can't believe I
forgot my gloves again!

37:04.744 --> 37:06.860
Come on, What?
Are you afraid of the dark?

37:06.895 --> 37:07.719
No.

37:07.753 --> 37:09.339
Come on!

37:15.609 --> 37:16.521
You feel that?

37:16.546 --> 37:17.503
Feel what?

37:17.537 --> 37:19.486
That thing that just swam by my leg?

37:19.521 --> 37:22.072
Ah, now it's gonna be
one of those days, isn't it?

37:23.652 --> 37:25.369
Come on!
Hurry up.

37:25.403 --> 37:26.909
<i>You guys reach
shut off valve I.R.T.</i>

37:26.910 --> 37:29.093
<i>11-38 yet?
That's the last one open.</i>

37:30.030 --> 37:34.460
Yeah dispatch we're almost there. Bud
here thought he'd seen an alligator.

37:34.493 --> 37:36.280
<i>If you guys don't
shut off the valve, the whole</i>

37:36.281 --> 37:37.830
<i>freakin' subways system's gonna flood.</i>

37:37.865 --> 37:40.805
Yeah, Roger that dispatch.
We're almost there.

37:40.839 --> 37:42.754
I didn't say that.

37:43.285 --> 37:44.738
Well you thought it.

38:04.736 --> 38:07.777
Look, I know we haven't been
as close as we use to be.

38:09.827 --> 38:13.429
Don't worry. I'm never gonna let
anything happen to your family.

38:13.462 --> 38:15.610
I screwed mine up.

38:15.776 --> 38:18.287
But you make Ellen and
the kids really happy.

38:19.015 --> 38:22.154
One of these days you're gonna
have to teach me how to do that.

38:24.073 --> 38:26.517
If I'm such a good family man...

38:26.551 --> 38:29.161
how come you have such a problem
with me dating your sister?

38:29.195 --> 38:32.268
Never had a problem with
you dating my sister.

38:32.302 --> 38:34.350
How about that fight we got into?

38:34.385 --> 38:36.630
You left for California and
you never spoke about it again.

38:36.665 --> 38:38.549
Neither did you.

38:39.641 --> 38:43.308
Look, when we were little we got into a
lot of trouble. Remember the dynamic duo?

38:43.444 --> 38:45.354
- Yeah.
- Yeah well.

38:46.251 --> 38:48.794
We broke a lot of hearts.

38:49.787 --> 38:51.462
We did.

38:52.497 --> 38:56.893
How can I get a guy like
that, marry my sister?

38:57.555 --> 38:59.985
Cause we were the same, man.

39:00.420 --> 39:01.850
Exactly.

39:06.315 --> 39:08.387
- What was that?
- What?

39:09.738 --> 39:13.063
Probably some giant subway
rat trying to get in the train.

39:14.117 --> 39:17.310
Maybe a hipster fell on the
tracks. They're pretty light.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.262
Where is this damn train?

39:25.080 --> 39:27.715
You should really be
eating fresh too, you know.

39:31.896 --> 39:33.389
We're in trouble.

39:33.524 --> 39:34.732
Come on! Move to the next car!

39:34.866 --> 39:36.933
Move, move, move, move, move, move!

39:42.894 --> 39:45.383
Everyone to the front of the train, now!

40:23.364 --> 40:25.362
- Come on Bryan!
- Bryan!

40:25.497 --> 40:27.393
Don't mess with a
Mets fan on the 7 train.

40:27.428 --> 40:28.594
Bryan! Watch out!

40:29.351 --> 40:32.002
Go, go, go!

40:40.102 --> 40:41.307
Go! I'm gonna help her!

40:41.341 --> 40:42.971
Go! I'll catch up!

40:44.503 --> 40:46.166
Go. Go!

40:52.215 --> 40:54.336
We gotta stop the train!

40:54.369 --> 40:56.297
You know we're dead!
We're dead!

40:56.843 --> 40:57.935
I got it!

41:09.892 --> 41:14.521
Go! Go! Go!

41:26.038 --> 41:27.352
Aah!

41:27.887 --> 41:29.016
- Fin!
- Fin!

41:29.051 --> 41:30.509
- Did you see him? Did you see him get out?
- No!

41:37.877 --> 41:39.129
- Fin?
- Fin!

41:39.164 --> 41:40.083
Fin!

41:40.152 --> 41:42.576
Fin!

41:44.750 --> 41:46.422
I'm right here.

41:47.244 --> 41:49.516
I hate the subway.

41:49.771 --> 41:51.729
- You ok?
- You alright man?

41:51.764 --> 41:53.604
- Yeah, come on. Let's go upstairs.
- Alright.

41:53.639 --> 41:54.982
- Uh...
- Fin!

41:55.184 --> 41:56.930
There's something on your left hip?

41:57.161 --> 42:00.802
- Yeah?
- You might want to get that one.

42:01.337 --> 42:03.295
- That hurt.
- That's gonna leave a mark.

42:03.330 --> 42:04.229
Let's go.

42:16.586 --> 42:18.075
Taxi!

42:37.529 --> 42:38.910
Thanks for picking us up.

42:39.932 --> 42:43.048
I knew if anyone was going to get out
that pickle at the ball park, it'd be you.

42:43.258 --> 42:44.643
So uh, where we going?

42:44.771 --> 42:46.029
Bales Tower, please.

42:46.474 --> 42:48.109
Ok, you got it buddy.

42:48.383 --> 42:51.569
We could go to my school. We'd
be safe from anything in there.

42:51.589 --> 42:53.116
That place is built
like a brick prison.

42:53.614 --> 42:54.917
We got to get your
mother and your sister.

42:54.932 --> 42:56.449
That depends on where he'd be safer.

42:56.450 --> 42:57.587
Alright, Alright, you
want me to stop here?

42:57.588 --> 42:59.177
You know what, he's
gonna be safer with us.

42:59.592 --> 43:00.995
Semper Paratus, right?

43:01.505 --> 43:02.569
I knew I liked that kid.

43:03.087 --> 43:05.249
It's obvious which side of
the family he takes after.

43:05.284 --> 43:07.126
Ok folks, so what do we need?

43:07.161 --> 43:09.070
I need guns.
I need ammo.

43:09.221 --> 43:10.514
Don't you know anything
about New York?

43:10.567 --> 43:12.952
There's no gun shops in this city.
It's illegal.

43:12.988 --> 43:14.191
He's right.

43:14.224 --> 43:15.831
Find a hardware store.

43:15.866 --> 43:17.505
Hardware store?
What for?

43:17.538 --> 43:19.814
I gotta get a chainsaw.

43:20.218 --> 43:22.025
Chainsaw?

43:22.058 --> 43:24.366
There's no chainsaws
in Manhattan either.

43:24.402 --> 43:26.677
I mean, you gotta go to
Long Island or Jersey.

43:26.711 --> 43:28.049
You don't want to go to Jersey.

43:28.083 --> 43:31.931
We can't Fin. We gotta get
to Ellen, and my little girl.

43:31.966 --> 43:34.442
Man do you really think there's gonna
be one of those shark storms here?

43:34.477 --> 43:35.748
Yes!

43:35.782 --> 43:37.421
Ok. Weapons it is.

43:37.456 --> 43:39.397
Ok, I'm also gonna need
some propane tanks.

43:39.431 --> 43:42.032
I'm gonna need some flares.
I'm gonna need a smoke alarm.

43:42.058 --> 43:43.781
I'm gonna need duck tape...
some wires.

43:43.815 --> 43:45.053
What for?

43:45.087 --> 43:47.765
I'm gonna throw a
bomb into the tornado.

43:47.799 --> 43:48.769
It worked in L.A.

43:48.804 --> 43:49.974
Fin, look around.

43:50.008 --> 43:51.413
This ain't L.A, bro.

43:51.447 --> 43:52.719
No kidding.

44:00.131 --> 44:03.408
Repent! Sinners!
The end is near!

44:03.441 --> 44:05.427
You all will be destroyed!

44:05.462 --> 44:06.917
You must repent!

44:06.951 --> 44:08.540
Repent sinners!

44:08.573 --> 44:10.526
He has seen what you have done!

44:10.560 --> 44:12.513
You...

44:12.713 --> 44:13.870
Hey man! That hurt!

44:13.904 --> 44:15.394
Come on! Get a job already!

44:15.428 --> 44:20.095
You will perish! You will perish
in a head and bolt from above!

44:20.128 --> 44:21.120
Are you ok?

44:21.155 --> 44:22.810
Bless you child.

44:27.181 --> 44:28.472
Baby come on!

44:28.505 --> 44:29.565
Come on! Come on!

44:29.598 --> 44:31.286
Honey!

44:33.635 --> 44:36.384
Ladies, you ok? Listen we
gotta get out of this storm.

44:36.519 --> 44:39.001
My office is right down the block
at the stock exchange, come with me.

44:39.034 --> 44:41.020
We'll wait it out.

44:43.041 --> 44:45.093
No, no, no! Come on!

44:47.940 --> 44:49.562
Come on! Come on!

44:52.741 --> 44:54.288
I'm a...

44:59.583 --> 45:02.421
I thought you said
there was a hardware store?

45:02.621 --> 45:05.091
Well it use to be here.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.563
It's gotta be some place else.

45:13.473 --> 45:15.275
So you're coming to
Magee's after work, or what?

45:15.308 --> 45:17.712
My kids have rehearsal tonight.

45:19.149 --> 45:20.951
Severed head or bowling ball?

45:20.985 --> 45:24.023
The way you bowl, you might use a
severed head you might do better.

45:24.056 --> 45:27.228
What the hell you say? I
bowled 6 flights last week.

45:28.797 --> 45:30.867
Top of the line. 15 pounder!

45:30.901 --> 45:32.303
Bam baby!

45:32.337 --> 45:34.239
Wait till you see this strike!

45:36.144 --> 45:39.448
Can I have your old one?

45:47.730 --> 45:48.930
Come this way!

45:48.965 --> 45:50.099
It's safer in here!

45:50.133 --> 45:53.004
Come on! Come on!

45:58.413 --> 46:00.450
Come on, come on, come on!

46:03.822 --> 46:05.091
Out of my way!

46:06.426 --> 46:08.161
What are you doing?

46:08.220 --> 46:10.342
Do you know how to drive
one of these things?

46:10.366 --> 46:13.203
Says the girl that
flunked her driver's test.

46:16.811 --> 46:20.148
You got it! Come on! Come on.

46:37.177 --> 46:38.879
Mom! She's getting closer!

46:38.913 --> 46:41.517
Just like an arcade girls!

46:55.341 --> 46:56.941
Come on! Come on!

46:58.145 --> 47:01.116
Go, go, go! Run! Run! Run!

47:01.149 --> 47:02.584
Go, go, go!

47:15.308 --> 47:18.611
We have
breaking news there is random flooding

47:18.646 --> 47:21.149
right now throughout Manhattan.
We're going to have important

47:21.184 --> 47:23.552
details on street closures coming up.

47:23.588 --> 47:26.000
Matt, additionally
waterspouts now have been

47:26.001 --> 47:27.693
formed over the Hudson and East rivers.

47:27.728 --> 47:30.731
They're actually moving into
Manhattan towards each other.

47:30.766 --> 47:33.136
So residents are encouraged
to stay off the streets.

47:33.170 --> 47:35.555
I don't want to alarm
anyone but there is concern

47:35.556 --> 47:37.810
that New York maybe
facing a shark storm

47:37.844 --> 47:39.512
- similar...
- Sharknado.

47:39.547 --> 47:43.952
A shark storm similar to the one that tore
through the Los Angeles region last year.

47:43.987 --> 47:45.289
And Al does have more details.

47:45.323 --> 47:49.763
Matt, these-these Sharknadoes
are actually a rare anomaly.

47:49.798 --> 47:53.602
While they've been isolated reports in the
past of marine life actually being sucked

47:53.637 --> 47:58.377
into storms. A Sharknado is much
more powerful and a lot more deadly.

47:58.410 --> 48:01.349
I mentioned Los Angeles last
year. Anything learned by the

48:01.384 --> 48:04.020
situation there that New
Yorkers need to know now?

48:04.054 --> 48:08.394
You've got to avoid going near one at
all cost. They're very unpredictable.

48:08.428 --> 48:12.533
Think of it this way this
is a twister with teeth.

48:12.568 --> 48:14.002
Enough said.

48:14.038 --> 48:16.574
Enough said indeed,
Al. Thank you very much.

48:19.414 --> 48:21.716
If those 2 water spouts come
into Manhattan and meet up...

48:21.751 --> 48:23.586
It's not gonna be a good thing.

48:31.833 --> 48:33.201
Did you transfer Ms. Wexler?

48:33.236 --> 48:36.340
Everyone's in the basement Doctor.

48:57.209 --> 48:57.942
Why we stopping?

48:57.978 --> 49:00.213
Well I'm sure you can
find something around here.

49:00.246 --> 49:01.966
- What are we gonna find around here?
- Yeah!

49:01.983 --> 49:05.254
This is town square baby. This
is crossroads of the world.

49:05.289 --> 49:07.925
You can't find it here,
you can't find it anywhere.

49:07.960 --> 49:10.496
Come on Marty, I'm gonna
teach you how to improvise.

49:10.531 --> 49:11.397
I'm sure you will.

49:12.394 --> 49:13.533
Aren't you coming?

49:13.568 --> 49:15.806
What are you kidding?
There ain't no parking here.

49:15.815 --> 49:18.724
I'll stay with the cab, you guys
go. I'll wait for you right here.

49:21.146 --> 49:22.057
Alright we got to split up.

49:22.162 --> 49:24.956
Find any place that's open. Grab
anything you can use as a weapon.

49:24.991 --> 49:27.020
You go looking for bombs, I'm
going to go to the toy store.

49:27.056 --> 49:27.795
For what?

49:27.796 --> 49:30.307
Well, you gotta have something to
put the bombs in the tornado, right?

49:30.342 --> 49:31.547
- Yeah?
- I got you!

49:31.574 --> 49:32.658
Let's meet back here in 10.

49:32.694 --> 49:34.526
- Alright.
- Let's go.

49:35.127 --> 49:37.713
Hey, dummies, go around.

49:38.869 --> 49:40.980
Can you see the flashes? Use your eyes!

50:00.718 --> 50:01.446
Vinnie!

50:01.781 --> 50:03.284
Sorry we're closing.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.227
I'm just looking for Vinnie.
Is he around?

50:05.263 --> 50:08.210
Yo! Vinnie, you got a visitor.

50:10.440 --> 50:13.113
Well look who's back from la la land.

50:13.331 --> 50:16.455
Just in time for the end of the world.

50:16.596 --> 50:17.823
What's happening Vinnie?

50:18.026 --> 50:19.279
What are you doing here
on a day like this?

50:19.309 --> 50:21.530
Don't you see what the
storm has done to the city?

50:21.531 --> 50:24.097
I'm hoping you can help me out
with some emergency supplies.

50:24.132 --> 50:28.068
Those propane tanks you had from all
those summer BBQs. You still got 'em?

50:28.103 --> 50:31.836
Do you got a screw loose? Don't
you see it's dangerous out there?

50:31.872 --> 50:36.942
I give you a slice of pie. You're
safer in here then out there.

50:39.979 --> 50:42.378
Aah!

50:46.281 --> 50:48.951
Take whatever you want.

50:48.984 --> 50:51.452
Take it! Just take it!

50:59.311 --> 51:01.053
Alright Vaughn, we need propane bottles,

51:01.054 --> 51:03.245
road flares, and smoke
alarms for bombs, ok?

51:03.281 --> 51:05.582
And any type of weapons we can find.

51:17.524 --> 51:19.957
No propane. But I found this.

51:19.991 --> 51:23.527
It's a good idea son but I don't
think it's what Fin is looking for.

51:25.697 --> 51:28.433
I have something else in mind.

51:29.201 --> 51:31.279
I'm glad you got the
brains in the family.

51:31.301 --> 51:33.135
Let's get out of here. Come on.

51:35.437 --> 51:38.673
You know I stopped here on
my first date with April.

51:38.706 --> 51:40.608
I owe you one.

51:40.641 --> 51:42.909
Forget about it.

51:51.149 --> 51:55.790
- Yeah honk honk.
- Good idea. Yeah

51:55.791 --> 51:58.586
I like that, yeah.
Hey dummies, go around.

51:58.621 --> 52:02.090
See the flashers?  They're
on. Yeah.  Use your eyes.

52:02.124 --> 52:03.391
Dummies!

52:03.424 --> 52:04.416
What did you get?

52:04.417 --> 52:05.882
We got some of the stuff you needed.

52:05.883 --> 52:08.348
We got enough for the bombs.
We need more weapons!

52:29.750 --> 52:33.340
<i>New York City has now become the
second city to be struck by the terror of a</i>

52:33.344 --> 52:37.439
<i>Sharknado. Moments ago the waterspout came
ashore, devastating the United Nations.</i>

52:37.465 --> 52:38.804
There's nothing that's
gonna stop them.

52:39.094 --> 52:41.191
Step on it Ben. We're
gonna head back to the hotel.

52:41.228 --> 52:44.186
I got to get to some place high where
I can throw a bomb into the tornado.

52:44.221 --> 52:46.624
Bales Tower is the second
tallest hotel in North America.

52:46.655 --> 52:47.504
Exactly.

52:47.665 --> 52:48.971
When we get back to the
hotel, you go into the

52:49.030 --> 52:50.820
lobby and you stay
away from the windows.

52:50.990 --> 52:52.297
That will be the safest place.

53:04.203 --> 53:05.401
The bikes.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.341
<i>Attention all personnel,</i>

53:15.369 --> 53:17.175
<i>patients and staff are to make way to</i>

53:17.212 --> 53:22.564
<i>the basement immediately.  I repeat,
everyone in the building must get to the</i>

53:22.600 --> 53:26.206
<i>basement immediately.
This is not a drill.</i>

53:38.026 --> 53:39.334
I want my mommy.

53:39.370 --> 53:40.313
Are you ok?

53:41.441 --> 53:43.970
Ok, my name is April.

53:44.009 --> 53:45.759
I'm gonna help you, ok?

53:45.793 --> 53:47.618
- Ok.
- But you need to take my hand...

53:48.065 --> 53:51.344
and I'm gonna save you. But you have
to trust me. You gotta take my hand...

53:51.428 --> 53:53.423
- I don't want to go.
- Be brave.

53:54.622 --> 53:56.076
We'll be brave together.

54:00.504 --> 54:01.543
Come on.

54:21.662 --> 54:23.509
What are you doing?
You can't leave the hospital.

54:23.539 --> 54:26.113
I'm gonna go get my husband.
Take her to the basement, now!

54:26.190 --> 54:26.989
Thanks, April.

54:41.889 --> 54:45.876
<i>...And these shark could
be coming down at 2 inches an hour.</i>

54:45.913 --> 54:48.466
There's also gonna be
significant wind. It could be

54:48.503 --> 54:52.096
blowing sharks down Broadway.
So you do have to watch out for

54:52.135 --> 54:55.105
flying debris and also you
have to worry about surge...

54:55.163 --> 54:55.943
- Fin.
- Why?

54:55.944 --> 54:58.556
<i>Because the serpent
is coming from the south.</i>

55:42.491 --> 55:43.715
Geez!

55:46.432 --> 55:48.813
Holly Sh... ark.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.121
<i>Oh my God!
They're everywhere.</i>

55:53.872 --> 55:55.396
<i>Fin!</i>

55:55.410 --> 55:56.664
Come on Come on!

56:02.908 --> 56:04.580
<i>- Oh my God.
- We got to get over to those stairs.</i>

56:06.813 --> 56:08.104
We can't get across that!

56:08.137 --> 56:09.758
We can't stay here.

56:10.983 --> 56:12.572
We gotta go across.

56:12.841 --> 56:14.766
Hey Ben!
Do you have any rope in there?

56:14.989 --> 56:17.570
Yeah! I got some tow rope.

56:23.196 --> 56:25.310
<i>Fin's gonna figure something out.</i>

56:27.927 --> 56:29.910
<i>He is. He can do it.</i>

56:29.945 --> 56:32.101
You're gonna make me
go first, aren't you?

56:38.382 --> 56:39.938
Careful Dad.

56:42.918 --> 56:44.174
Go.

56:47.153 --> 56:47.979
Yeah!

56:48.012 --> 56:48.770
Yes!

56:50.010 --> 56:50.969
Come on!

56:51.645 --> 56:54.465
- Come on! Come on! Who's next?
- Let's go.

56:57.173 --> 56:58.499
You can do it, Vaughn!

56:58.675 --> 56:59.415
You're gonna be good!

57:00.408 --> 57:01.710
Come on! Come on!

57:02.566 --> 57:05.724
Let's go! Let's go! Come
on! Come on! Come on!

57:08.816 --> 57:10.131
You got it.

57:10.166 --> 57:12.499
I don't know if I can do this? I
can barely climb the rope in gym.

57:12.832 --> 57:14.454
How am I supposed to
swing over there?

57:14.769 --> 57:17.801
Just hold on to me kid.
It's gonna be alright.

57:17.836 --> 57:19.474
I got you baby.

57:25.103 --> 57:26.129
For luck.

57:27.546 --> 57:28.688
Come on! Come on! Come on!

57:28.712 --> 57:30.187
Ya!

57:32.550 --> 57:34.419
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on!

57:34.452 --> 57:36.387
You alright, buddy?

57:36.450 --> 57:37.622
Ben, you should do it.

57:38.421 --> 57:39.536
Ah.

57:39.962 --> 57:41.045
Wait.

57:45.140 --> 57:46.657
Move it! Move it! Move it!

57:47.901 --> 57:51.146
Whooooaaa.

57:51.277 --> 57:52.341
You can do it Ben.

57:52.460 --> 57:53.488
We got this!

57:54.318 --> 57:57.055
Hook's on the other side.
Keep your legs up!

57:57.090 --> 57:58.912
- I can do this.
- You can do it!

57:58.948 --> 58:01.210
Hold on Ben!
Hold on!

58:02.089 --> 58:03.036
Ben!

58:03.069 --> 58:05.806
Oh no!

58:05.840 --> 58:09.151
Oh!

58:18.313 --> 58:19.749
We'll try to find another rope!

58:20.398 --> 58:22.396
There's no time.

58:25.986 --> 58:28.017
Frogger.

58:30.321 --> 58:31.741
Yah!

58:33.604 --> 58:35.805
- Yes!
- Nice, Nice! You got it!

58:37.787 --> 58:39.775
You know what you just did, don't ya?

58:39.801 --> 58:41.360
Don't say it.

58:41.395 --> 58:42.567
He jumped the shark.

58:43.160 --> 58:44.611
Let's get outta here.
Come on! Let's go!

58:45.098 --> 58:46.421
Let's go!
Come on!

58:46.455 --> 58:48.560
- Ellen! Mora!
- Mom!

58:48.595 --> 58:50.193
Can I help you?

58:50.227 --> 58:51.992
No one else is here.

58:52.027 --> 58:55.048
- We gotta go get her.
- Wait. Fin hold up.

58:55.083 --> 58:57.325
Ellen is not the same
little girl you remember.

58:57.360 --> 59:02.166
She's taken Martial Arts, she's run in
marathons. My wife kinda kicks ass...

59:02.167 --> 59:03.778
She'll get 'em here.

59:04.493 --> 59:05.919
Let's get to the roof.
Come on.

59:05.953 --> 59:07.720
Hold up!

59:08.026 --> 59:09.723
We'll go up to the roof.

59:10.098 --> 59:11.353
You two wait here.

59:11.388 --> 59:14.003
You get killed, she'll kill me.

59:14.378 --> 59:16.006
Come on. Let's go.

59:16.041 --> 59:18.047
Be safe guys.

59:34.323 --> 59:37.399
So what's so bad about being famous?

59:37.742 --> 59:40.238
I was famous when I was a surfer.

59:40.819 --> 59:42.564
It cost me my family.

59:42.630 --> 59:44.171
Because you were famous?

59:44.240 --> 59:46.669
Because I thought I was a star?

59:46.739 --> 59:48.688
I thought I deserved
everything I was offered.

59:48.757 --> 59:50.461
I was offered a lot.

59:50.531 --> 59:53.620
You saved a lot of people in L.A, Fin.

59:53.989 --> 59:55.486
You're uncomfortable with that?

59:55.967 --> 59:57.216
It's different.

59:57.481 --> 01:00:00.837
When you got girls in bikini's
screaming for you, it strokes your ego.

01:00:01.677 --> 01:00:04.870
But when you got people thanking you
for saving their lives...

01:00:07.018 --> 01:00:08.970
It's humbling.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:12.794
The best thing that came out of that was
a chance to put my family back together.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:17.045
I can't risk screwing that up again.

01:00:17.116 --> 01:00:19.176
If we'd married...

01:00:19.247 --> 01:00:21.458
I would have never
let you screw that up.

01:00:25.598 --> 01:00:28.306
To bad your father didn't think so.

01:00:30.568 --> 01:00:32.134
It was a different time, Fin.

01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:32.995
Yeah.

01:00:37.474 --> 01:00:39.273
And my daddy didn't love you.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:40.947
I did.

01:00:43.262 --> 01:00:45.210
And that's what
should've mattered to you.

01:01:02.369 --> 01:01:03.546
Polly come on!

01:01:03.614 --> 01:01:07.094
Keep going! Don't stop!
I'm ok. I'll catch up!

01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:08.905
Come on baby!

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.571
Polly come on!

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:16.251
Just keep going!
I'll catch up!

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:17.831
Mora, this way!

01:01:19.715 --> 01:01:21.294
Polly!
Come on!

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.040
We gotta get inside the hotel.

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.629
Let's go Mora!
Come on!

01:01:26.672 --> 01:01:28.220
Come on Mora!

01:01:38.842 --> 01:01:40.052
Martin!

01:01:40.119 --> 01:01:42.137
- Mora!
- Mom!

01:01:42.204 --> 01:01:44.084
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:45.902
Thank God.

01:01:48.427 --> 01:01:49.777
I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:01:49.802 --> 01:01:51.278
Where's Fin? He said
he was going to get you?

01:01:51.346 --> 01:01:52.757
He did. He's up on the roof.

01:01:52.827 --> 01:01:53.699
He's on the roof?

01:01:53.768 --> 01:01:54.776
Yep.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.335
He's doing something dangerous again.

01:01:56.387 --> 01:01:58.338
Of course he is. Fin does what Fin does.

01:01:58.406 --> 01:02:00.790
Didn't you try to stop him?

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.917
I did but wanted to make sure
that you two guys got here.

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:06.881
I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.404
Come on.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.006
Come on, Come on.

01:02:48.063 --> 01:02:49.321
Come on.
Come over here.

01:02:58.457 --> 01:03:01.258
We gotta work quick
before the twisters merge!

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.374
You sure this is gonna work?

01:03:13.259 --> 01:03:15.604
Go ahead and get
these into the storm?

01:03:16.568 --> 01:03:17.373
I gotcha.

01:03:17.436 --> 01:03:19.802
- Sling shot.
- Nice.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:20.788
Told you to trust me.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.309
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where
you going Ellen? Where you going?

01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:31.749
I'm going up there.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.129
Fin was very specific. We're not
supposed to get ourselves killed.

01:03:34.198 --> 01:03:36.236
So it's ok for him,
but it's not ok for me?

01:03:36.306 --> 01:03:37.869
Mom!

01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:39.502
Just stop.

01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.018
- Stay here.
- Stay here.

01:03:42.086 --> 01:03:43.083
Stay here.

01:03:43.664 --> 01:03:45.603
We are now receiving reports that the

01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.939
twisters from the rivers
are about to merge.

01:03:47.964 --> 01:03:51.456
Apparently this will happen
right over the Bales Tower hotel.

01:03:51.526 --> 01:03:53.483
And Al, the big question is first of all,

01:03:53.484 --> 01:03:56.458
what is drawing these
two twisters together?

01:03:56.502 --> 01:03:59.417
And I don't even want to ask but
what happens when they finally meet?

01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:02.972
Matt, I am really nervous about this.
If fact, I'll say I'm down right scared.

01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:04.984
Here's the problem.
The island of Manhattan

01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:08.488
creates a lot of heat.
As the hot air rises,

01:04:08.529 --> 01:04:11.264
cool air is sucked in to replace it.

01:04:11.299 --> 01:04:15.032
That affect is drawing
these Sharknadoes to the very

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:19.772
heart of this city. Now if
these two EF2 tornadoes merge...

01:04:19.807 --> 01:04:24.419
their power can actually multiply. We
could be talking about an EF5 Sharknado

01:04:24.454 --> 01:04:29.057
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Matt, that's sufficient power enough

01:04:29.092 --> 01:04:31.810
to damage steel reinforced skyscrapers.

01:04:31.845 --> 01:04:34.328
I've never seen anything
like this. Stay with us, Al.

01:04:34.363 --> 01:04:37.146
We go live to Manhattan with
weatherman, Raphael Miranda.

01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:38.662
From our local station that's

01:04:38.697 --> 01:04:42.952
NBC 4.   Can you tell us a little bit more
about what's happening down there, Raphael?

01:04:43.076 --> 01:04:47.114
Thanks Matt. This storm is already taking
a toll on the city. The residence are

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:50.552
panicked because of the sharks
that keep raining down from the sky.

01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:05.966
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:05:12.851 --> 01:05:14.198
It's not working.

01:05:14.592 --> 01:05:16.660
Let's double them up.
Come on.

01:05:20.371 --> 01:05:21.536
Shark!

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:31.728
Yeah!

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:50.097
Let's double it up.

01:06:03.853 --> 01:06:05.159
- Get it!
- Come on. Come on.

01:06:05.765 --> 01:06:06.598
Come on!

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.659
Why isn't it working?

01:06:17.716 --> 01:06:19.907
Even the Sharknadoes
are tougher in New York.

01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:36.621
Come on!  Move it!
Move it!  Come on!

01:06:42.073 --> 01:06:43.763
The twisters are too close!

01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:44.880
We're not generating enough heat.

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:47.367
Let's make a big bomb.

01:06:47.402 --> 01:06:49.076
Hmm, why not.

01:06:53.398 --> 01:06:54.316
Looks good.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.404
We work good together.

01:07:02.535 --> 01:07:03.951
That was never the problem.

01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:10.738
3-2-1!

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.536
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:07:14.571 --> 01:07:15.704
Come on!

01:07:23.104 --> 01:07:24.230
Crap!

01:07:24.296 --> 01:07:26.053
You're just making this
up as you go along.

01:07:26.088 --> 01:07:27.321
Let's keep that our secret.

01:07:27.389 --> 01:07:28.996
Oh man!

01:07:52.924 --> 01:07:54.616
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

01:07:56.918 --> 01:07:57.774
Come on!

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:04.226
It's still coming.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:05.899
How is that possible?

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.996
If it keeps going, this building is
going to fill up like a fish tank.

01:08:08.064 --> 01:08:10.400
Except that these gold fish have big teeth.

01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:13.403
Come on baby!

01:08:15.073 --> 01:08:17.307
- Come on, follow me!
- Mom!

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640
Come on! Come on!

01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:21.042
Ellen! Ellen!  Wait!
Where are you going?

01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:22.179
Up!

01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:24.715
The hotel is flooded and the water
is rising. Why are you coming down?

01:08:24.783 --> 01:08:25.550
Flaming sharks!

01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:32.725
Come on!  Come on!
Move! Move!

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.202
Go.

01:08:37.733 --> 01:08:38.651
Go.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:51.912
We're trapped!

01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:53.581
We're going to die.

01:08:53.913 --> 01:08:54.886
No, we're not.

01:08:55.527 --> 01:08:58.729
Look the door is jammed but, theirs
a fire escape on the other side.

01:08:58.754 --> 01:08:59.720
If we can get it open.

01:08:59.786 --> 01:09:02.122
Open it with what?

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.694
That...

01:09:07.497 --> 01:09:08.662
We can't go down there.

01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:11.098
Remember those bar
fights we use to get into?

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:12.600
- Bait and switch.
- Let's go, - Let's do it.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.036
No, No!

01:09:20.044 --> 01:09:23.946
- The fire is getting closer!
- Hurry guys!

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.161
It's coming alright, on three...

01:09:28.185 --> 01:09:29.218
Hurry up!

01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:31.371
One. Two...

01:09:31.406 --> 01:09:34.425
Hey over here, hey!
Come here! Hey!

01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:35.800
Come on.
Hurry!

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:51.139
I got it! I got it! I got it!

01:09:51.443 --> 01:09:54.685
Go. Go. Go!

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.422
Fin come on!

01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:02.494
Come on.

01:10:10.589 --> 01:10:12.439
Come on! Move it!  We
gotta get to the street.

01:10:25.777 --> 01:10:28.453
Need a ride?

01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:31.752
Come on.

01:10:41.339 --> 01:10:43.839
We are now receiving reports of a third

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.835
twister coming ashore
in downtown Manhattan.

01:10:47.121 --> 01:10:50.767
This is the lightning storm that
damaged the Statue of Liberty.

01:10:50.802 --> 01:10:54.060
It appears to be moving
North, at the very same time,

01:10:54.095 --> 01:10:59.200
the double... Sharknado. Now
appears to be moving south toward it.

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:00.125
Al, what's going on?

01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:02.797
Ok, so Matt. The tall buildings
of Manhattan seem to be creating

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:06.876
a wind tunnel effect. Actually drawing
the two storms toward each other.

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:11.859
Our current radar track shows them both
headed towards the Empire State Building.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:15.734
If the double Sharknado, should
converge with the other...

01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:17.407
What?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.985
We're talking about a storm
of biblical proportions Matt.

01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:25.796
If they are not stopped we can
be talking about unprecedented

01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:28.005
devastation in the heart of New York City.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:35.546
We have very little
time.  I need to know

01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:37.007
if the Freon tanks are still up there.

01:11:37.017 --> 01:11:38.283
I will check with the chief.

01:11:45.663 --> 01:11:47.489
- You're ok?
- Yeah.

01:11:48.624 --> 01:11:51.649
Just let the Mayor know that Fin just
arrived at the Empire State Building.

01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:59.148
That's her, isn't it?
The one from high school?

01:12:00.946 --> 01:12:02.477
She still likes you I can tell.

01:12:02.512 --> 01:12:03.910
That's not important.

01:12:03.943 --> 01:12:05.718
Me and you, that's all that matters.

01:12:07.672 --> 01:12:09.971
Fin.
Fin Sheppard.

01:12:10.004 --> 01:12:11.468
Mayor.
It's an honor.

01:12:11.502 --> 01:12:12.734
Pleasure to meet you.

01:12:12.768 --> 01:12:14.799
Listen, Fin we need your help.

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.596
I just got to get my family to safety.

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:19.093
Of course, of course. Whatever
you need. You're the expert.

01:12:19.129 --> 01:12:22.224
Well, last time that
happened, it didn't go so well.

01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:25.188
As a matter of fact, Los Angeles
didn't really appreciate it.

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:27.353
Well this is the Big Apple, Fin.

01:12:27.388 --> 01:12:30.515
When something bites us,
we bite back.

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:34.646
We band together. We work
together. We fight together.

01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:38.309
You're a New Yorker Fin.
And your city is behind you.

01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:41.673
Mr. Mayor.
I have to talk to Fin.

01:12:42.039 --> 01:12:44.336
The freon tanks are still up there.

01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:47.865
Just inside a control room.
Above the observation deck.

01:12:47.899 --> 01:12:49.530
You got the schematics
from the lightning rod?

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.896
Yeah.

01:12:55.424 --> 01:12:58.754
The twisters are expected to
meet in about eight minutes.

01:12:59.654 --> 01:13:01.218
This might work.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.383
I don't understand.

01:13:02.418 --> 01:13:03.449
What's your plan?

01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:05.280
Well we can't equalize
the pressure with a bomb.

01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:07.577
It's too dangerous. And the
twisters are to cold, right?

01:13:07.613 --> 01:13:08.875
Right.

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:12.361
Well if I can't blow it
out, I'll freeze it out.

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:15.458
I'll throw the freon tank into the storm.

01:13:17.202 --> 01:13:21.145
I have no idea if that's going
to work. But it's a moot point.

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:25.046
We don't have the explosives
here to make that happen.

01:13:25.128 --> 01:13:26.859
That's why we're going to use
the lightning rod, to blow the

01:13:26.892 --> 01:13:29.057
freon tank through the
building into the storm.

01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:30.645
That's crazy.
You're going to get killed.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.252
Maybe not. But that's why
I'm going to do it by myself.

01:13:33.286 --> 01:13:35.226
No, no, no. I'm coming
with you, I almost lost

01:13:35.227 --> 01:13:36.550
you once and I'm not
going to do it again.

01:13:36.683 --> 01:13:41.110
April. You can't help me up
there.  Especially with this.

01:13:42.276 --> 01:13:44.299
Promise me you won't die on me.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.454
Hey listen. Listen, if you're going
to do it, you gotta get up there now.

01:13:50.003 --> 01:13:53.144
Alright. If this works it's going to
take all the power out of the storm.

01:13:54.032 --> 01:13:56.396
And there's a lot of
sharks up there still.

01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:58.812
People on the ground better be ready.

01:13:58.828 --> 01:14:00.824
We'll take care of it.

01:14:00.859 --> 01:14:03.154
Hey.  Why can't
somebody else do this?

01:14:03.155 --> 01:14:03.948
Look, I did this once...

01:14:03.954 --> 01:14:06.351
I know... and I'm
really proud of you, Fin.

01:14:06.387 --> 01:14:07.885
And thank you for getting Martin.

01:14:07.918 --> 01:14:11.513
And you saved my boys
life.  Isn't that enough?

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:14.910
You're family.
It's alright.

01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:18.639
If you don't come back,
I'm going to kill you.

01:14:22.169 --> 01:14:23.601
You take care of them.

01:14:23.636 --> 01:14:24.898
Always.

01:14:25.233 --> 01:14:27.726
You know man, It was great
to rumble one more time.

01:14:27.752 --> 01:14:30.228
That we got to do that dynamic duo.

01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:31.726
It was good.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.356
What kills me.
You're always Batman.

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:37.517
...the highest
concentration of sharks.

01:14:37.521 --> 01:14:39.718
That's where they will
be falling the heaviest.

01:14:39.754 --> 01:14:43.083
And you can see that's going to be
making it's way on into New York City.

01:14:43.115 --> 01:14:47.776
Just a monster storm for us. We are
talking about shark falling rates

01:14:47.811 --> 01:14:52.504
<i>of two inches an hour. So those sharks
are really going to pile up here.</i>

01:14:52.539 --> 01:14:56.101
<i>They're going to continue to race
off to the north and the east.</i>

01:14:56.135 --> 01:14:59.631
If you do have advisories posted.
If you are told to evacuate.

01:14:59.665 --> 01:15:03.961
Listen to those warnings and
make sure you seek shelter.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:10.521
Hey Fin! Thought you
could use one of these.

01:15:10.554 --> 01:15:13.585
And we didn't have to
go to Jersey to get it.

01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:15.615
Sweet.

01:15:26.339 --> 01:15:29.889
Alright. Listen up! There's a storm coming.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:33.364
A storm the likes that
you've never seen before.

01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:35.929
Now I'm gonna go up there
and I'm gonna try to stop it.

01:15:35.963 --> 01:15:39.258
And there's going to be a lot of people
down here that are going to need your help.

01:15:39.293 --> 01:15:41.355
I know you're scared.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.086
I'm scared too.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.551
They're sharks. They're scary.
No one wants to get eaten.

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:49.846
But I've been eaten. And
I'm here to tell you...

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.343
Takes a lot more than that
to bring a good man down.

01:15:54.077 --> 01:15:56.458
A lot more than that to
bring a New Yorker down.

01:16:19.184 --> 01:16:20.186
You're brilliant!

01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:24.013
Let's go show them what
it means to be a hero.

01:16:25.536 --> 01:16:28.004
Let's go show them what it
means to be a New Yorker!

01:16:30.136 --> 01:16:31.556
Let's go kill some sharks!

01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:41.069
What are you doing?

01:16:41.105 --> 01:16:43.957
Don't even waste your breath. This
is my city too and you're going

01:16:43.992 --> 01:16:45.446
to need all the help you can get.

01:16:46.137 --> 01:16:47.755
Let's go.

01:16:54.226 --> 01:16:57.099
I have an idea. But I'm
going to need your help.

01:17:03.289 --> 01:17:05.558
The freon tanks are up there.

01:17:08.577 --> 01:17:10.812
We got to blow the tanks
before the storms merge.

01:17:10.836 --> 01:17:12.588
Otherwise it's gonna take

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:19.784
Hey, where you going?

01:17:19.821 --> 01:17:21.712

01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:34.574
Ah, shoot!

01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:04.200

01:18:05.769 --> 01:18:07.188

01:18:21.453 --> 01:18:25.350
Alright... black to black.

Take her down stairs, I'm going to
blow up the top of the building!

01:18:57.694 --> 01:18:59.322
- No, I'm not gonna go!

01:18:59.357 --> 01:19:01.454
