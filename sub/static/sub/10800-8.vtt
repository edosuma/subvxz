WEBVTT

00:03.395 --> 00:06.728
Captain's Log, Stardate 44286.5.

00:06.765 --> 00:09.165
The <i>Enterprise</i> is conducting
a security survey

00:09.201 --> 00:11.795
of the Onias Sector
near the Neutral Zone.

00:11.837 --> 00:14.431
Despite our proximity
to Romulan territory

00:14.473 --> 00:18.239
the mission has been quiet
and uneventful.

00:25.217 --> 00:27.185
All right, Commander,
you've got until

00:27.219 --> 00:29.187
your next birthday
to get that right.

00:29.221 --> 00:30.552
Some things improve with age.

00:30.589 --> 00:32.853
Maybe your trombone playing
will be one of them.

00:32.891 --> 00:35.792
lt's candle time, birthday boy.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.524
Whoo!
All right.

00:39.564 --> 00:42.533
So, what did you wish for, Will?

00:42.567 --> 00:43.966
Music lessons.

00:49.241 --> 00:50.765
Mr. Data, we must hurry

00:50.809 --> 00:53.539
or we'll miss
Commander Riker's party.

00:53.578 --> 00:57.207
Sir, l find it interesting how
much importance humans place

00:57.249 --> 00:59.046
on celebrating the day
of their birth--

00:59.084 --> 01:00.881
a day they cannot
possibly remember.

01:00.919 --> 01:03.410
Captain, l am detecting
some unusual fluctuations

01:03.455 --> 01:05.719
in subspace frequencies.

01:07.392 --> 01:10.122
We'd better take a look at it,
Mr. Data.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.164
lt appears
we are being probed, sir.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.635
The source?

01:18.670 --> 01:21.332
The third planet
of the Alpha Onias system.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.672
Our reports list it
as presently uninhabited.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.508
Perhaps reports
were incorrect, sir.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.947
Or maybe the rumors
of a secret Romulan base

01:30.982 --> 01:32.916
in this sector are true.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.350
Picard to Commander Riker.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.948
l apologize for interrupting
your celebration

01:38.990 --> 01:41.015
but l'm going to need
an away team.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.924
Would you report
to the Bridge, please?

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.939 --> 01:57.067
Although Alpha Onias lll
is a Class-M planet

01:57.109 --> 02:01.205
our survey teams have listed it
as ''barren and inhospitable.''

02:01.246 --> 02:02.474
Any life signs?

02:02.514 --> 02:03.640
No, sir.

02:03.682 --> 02:06.014
But we have traced
residual energy readings

02:06.051 --> 02:08.485
to a cavern two kilometers
beneath the surface.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.817
Romulans.

02:09.854 --> 02:10.822
lt is possible.

02:10.856 --> 02:11.880
l suppose you'll just

02:11.923 --> 02:13.686
have to go down there
and find out.

02:13.725 --> 02:16.159
Geordi, Worf, you're with me.

02:16.194 --> 02:18.560
Number One?

02:18.597 --> 02:20.360
Happy birthday.

02:40.152 --> 02:42.882
l'm detecting high levels
of volcanic gases--

02:42.921 --> 02:46.857
sulfur dioxide,
methane, hydrogen sulfide.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.189
Toxic?

02:48.226 --> 02:50.160
Uh, we're okay for now,
but l wouldn't

02:50.195 --> 02:51.958
want to spend my vacation here.

02:53.832 --> 02:55.527
What about energy readings?

02:55.567 --> 02:57.398
Magnetic clutter is increasing.

02:57.436 --> 02:59.199
l cannot make
an accurate determination.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.635
Same here, Commander.

03:00.672 --> 03:03.470
l'm getting a lot
of confusing readings here.

03:03.508 --> 03:06.272
Picard to Riker,
please acknowledge.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.539
Riker here.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.479
We're having trouble
reading you.

03:09.514 --> 03:12.244
And we're having similar
difficulties reading you.

03:12.284 --> 03:14.548
l'm advising you
and your away team

03:14.586 --> 03:16.315
to transport up at once.

03:16.354 --> 03:17.651
That's good advice, Commander.

03:17.689 --> 03:19.054
We've got a sudden build-up

03:19.090 --> 03:20.785
of gases here,
especially methane.

03:20.826 --> 03:24.159
Transporter Room, take us up.

03:24.196 --> 03:27.927
l can't get
a solid lock on you, sir.

03:27.966 --> 03:29.729
There's too much interference.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.030
l'm trying again.

03:33.705 --> 03:35.172
Transporter Room,
what's happening?

03:35.240 --> 03:36.502
Report!

03:36.541 --> 03:37.735
l'm trying again, sir.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.950
Dr. Crusher, he's awake.

03:59.397 --> 04:00.921
Beverly.

04:00.966 --> 04:03.366
Will, you remember me.

04:03.401 --> 04:05.392
That's good.

04:05.437 --> 04:08.167
What else do you
remember, Captain?

04:10.442 --> 04:12.876
Captain?

04:45.844 --> 04:50.372
Space, the final frontier.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.181
These are the voyages
of the Starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

04:54.286 --> 04:56.481
lts continuing mission--

04:56.521 --> 04:59.752
to explore strange new worlds

04:59.791 --> 05:04.387
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

05:04.429 --> 05:09.128
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:09.461 --> 06:12.624
Water, three Celsius.

06:22.107 --> 06:24.041
How do you feel?

06:24.075 --> 06:26.339
Confused.

06:26.378 --> 06:30.109
That's understandable,
considering what's happened.

06:32.384 --> 06:33.783
What has happened?

06:33.818 --> 06:35.149
What happened to Sick Bay?

06:35.253 --> 06:38.154
To you... to me?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.316
Sit down, Captain.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.156
Captain?
l am Commander William T. Riker.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.889
What is going on here?

06:44.929 --> 06:46.294
Sit.

06:46.331 --> 06:48.299
Please.

06:51.870 --> 06:57.103
What is the last thing
that you remember clearly?

06:57.142 --> 06:59.110
Alpha Onias lll.

06:59.144 --> 07:01.442
The <i>Enterprise</i> had been probed.

07:01.479 --> 07:05.882
Geordi, Worf and l transported
down to track the source.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.784
But all you found there
was toxic gas.

07:08.820 --> 07:12.779
They barely had time
to get the three of you out.

07:12.824 --> 07:17.818
Will, that happened
16 years ago.

07:22.033 --> 07:24.627
That's not possible.

07:24.669 --> 07:27.638
With an Altarian virus,
anything is possible.

07:27.672 --> 07:30.334
ln fact, we've been
expecting this.

07:32.844 --> 07:35.142
Could you be more specific?

07:35.246 --> 07:38.477
That day on Onias lll,
you were infected

07:38.516 --> 07:42.145
with a strain
of Altarian encephalitis--

07:42.220 --> 07:44.814
a retrovirus
that incorporates its DNA

07:44.856 --> 07:47.017
directly into the cells
of its host.

07:47.058 --> 07:48.491
lt can lie dormant
for many years

07:48.526 --> 07:50.494
and then suddenly
become active again

07:50.528 --> 07:54.828
as it did in your case
ten days ago.

07:54.866 --> 07:57.767
You have been in a coma,
delirious.

07:57.802 --> 08:00.635
Your fever finally broke
this morning.

08:00.672 --> 08:03.732
But what happened to my memory?

08:05.143 --> 08:08.806
Let me show you a scan
of your brain tissue.

08:13.651 --> 08:16.119
When the encephalitis
became active

08:16.154 --> 08:18.452
it caused widespread
synapse degradation

08:18.490 --> 08:21.459
interrupting the consolidation
of your memory patterns.

08:21.493 --> 08:23.051
Doctor.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.960
Will, this virus
inevitably causes

08:30.001 --> 08:34.631
memory loss back to the moment
of the original infection.

08:34.672 --> 08:38.768
ln your case, all the way back
to Alpha Onias lll.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.072
l don't believe this.

08:40.111 --> 08:42.135
ls this a dream?

08:42.179 --> 08:43.147
Feel my hand.

08:43.181 --> 08:44.808
lt is flesh and bone.

08:44.849 --> 08:46.476
This is not a dream.

08:46.518 --> 08:49.817
And you are, in fact,
Captain William T. Riker

08:49.854 --> 08:51.913
in command of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

08:51.956 --> 08:53.787
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

08:53.825 --> 08:55.452
For how long?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.427
Nine years.

08:59.798 --> 09:04.565
lf l've lost my memory,
how do l get it back?

09:04.602 --> 09:07.765
Memories are formed
by association.

09:07.806 --> 09:11.264
Smells, sounds
and images from the present

09:11.309 --> 09:13.106
could possibly trigger them.

09:13.144 --> 09:16.602
Like a song reminds you
of an old friend.

09:16.648 --> 09:17.774
Exactly.

09:17.816 --> 09:19.113
ln associational therapy

09:19.217 --> 09:21.879
we expose the patient
to familiar surroundings.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.684
This could stimulate
the brain's neural synapses

09:24.722 --> 09:25.746
into regenerating.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.018
Well, then let's get started.

09:27.058 --> 09:29.117
There's nothing more familiar
than the <i>Enterprise.</i>

09:29.194 --> 09:30.786
Maybe that'll bring back
some of my...

09:30.829 --> 09:32.854
Will.

09:32.897 --> 09:36.128
l said your memory could return.

09:36.167 --> 09:39.295
ln many of these cases,
the damage is permanent.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.383
What about Geordi and Worf?

09:49.421 --> 09:50.945
Were they infected, too?

09:50.990 --> 09:51.957
Thankfully, no.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.549
Geordi appears
to have been immune

09:53.592 --> 09:56.254
and the Klingons don't seem
to be affected by the virus.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.762
Speaking of Klingons.

09:57.796 --> 09:59.525
There have been
quite a few changes

09:59.565 --> 10:01.795
on the <i>Enterprise</i>
during the last 16 years.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.663
Deck eight.

10:04.703 --> 10:06.102
Belay that order.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.072
We should begin
the associational therapy

10:08.107 --> 10:09.369
in your quarters.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.774
Personal recollections
are always the most vivid.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.903
My life was on the Main Bridge.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.436
Always has been.

10:15.481 --> 10:18.712
lf anything's going
to jog my memory...

10:18.751 --> 10:19.809
Main Bridge.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.116
Repeat command.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.951
l said, Main Bridge.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.617
The computer's been
slow all morning.

10:26.658 --> 10:28.455
A processing attenuator is down.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.086
Commander La Forge
has been running

10:30.129 --> 10:32.563
a level-1 diagnostic on
it to isolate the problem.

10:38.837 --> 10:40.134
Geordi.

10:40.172 --> 10:43.767
Oh, it's good to see you
up and about again, sir.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.142
Your eyes--
what happened to your VlSOR?

10:47.246 --> 10:50.147
My VlSOR?

10:50.182 --> 10:51.809
Oh, l'm sorry, sir.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.875
Dr. Crusher told us
that you might not remember.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.079
l haven't needed a VlSOR

10:55.120 --> 10:57.213
since l got these cloned
implants, Captain.

11:09.134 --> 11:10.567
Captain.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.397
Welcome back, Captain.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.102
We were not expecting to see you
on the Bridge so soon.

11:17.142 --> 11:20.634
Commander Data,
you are my First Officer?

11:20.679 --> 11:22.408
Do you remember, sir?

11:22.448 --> 11:27.317
Data, l haven't remembered a day
for the last 16 years.

11:27.352 --> 11:28.785
Captain, warbird uncloaking.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.379
On screen.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.517
Shields up.

11:35.561 --> 11:36.789
Red Alert.

11:36.829 --> 11:41.095
Captain, we were expecting
the <i>Decius.</i>

11:41.133 --> 11:42.964
There is no cause for alarm.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.633
Cancel Red Alert.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.906
Clearly, l need to be briefed.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.004
Captain, the <i>Decius</i>
is hailing us.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.982
The Admiral wishes
to speak to you.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.476
On screen.

12:02.387 --> 12:04.378
Will.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.290
Admiral Picard.

12:09.328 --> 12:10.295
Deanna.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.921
How are you feeling?

12:11.964 --> 12:13.261
l've been better.

12:13.298 --> 12:14.595
Not surprising.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.033
Altarian viruses
can be a nasty business.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.036
That's an understatement.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.094
l can't even...

12:19.171 --> 12:21.503
We'll discuss this
after we've transported over.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.529
Picard out.

12:33.418 --> 12:36.979
Transporter Room Six.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.456
How are you holding up?

12:39.491 --> 12:42.551
l could get used to the idea
of a Ferengi ensign

12:42.594 --> 12:46.325
but Admiral Picard
aboard a Romulan warbird?

12:46.365 --> 12:48.333
What is that all about?

12:48.367 --> 12:51.268
l think l should leave
all the explanations

12:51.303 --> 12:52.736
to the Admiral.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.604
Whenever you're ready, Chief.

13:05.651 --> 13:06.675
Captain Riker

13:06.718 --> 13:08.982
it's good to see
you've recovered.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.479
l'm not exactly sure
you'd call it a recovery, sir.

13:12.524 --> 13:15.084
Then there has been
some memory loss?

13:16.628 --> 13:18.255
How much?

13:18.297 --> 13:21.664
Everything
after Alpha Onias lll.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.431
To lose 16 years...

13:25.470 --> 13:28.462
it's almost beyond belief.

13:29.474 --> 13:32.443
l have trouble
believing it myself.

13:32.477 --> 13:35.105
lt's so overwhelming to have
so much of your life missing.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.342
And it couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

13:37.382 --> 13:39.680
A few more days of relatively
simple negotiation

13:39.718 --> 13:41.117
and the treaty will be signed.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.347
What negotiations?
What treaty?

13:43.388 --> 13:44.685
Sorry.

13:44.723 --> 13:48.056
l'll start at the beginning...

13:48.093 --> 13:50.288
which is four years ago.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.821
A Romulan battle cruiser
strayed into Federation space.

13:53.865 --> 13:55.696
lts warp coils had collapsed.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.224
Life support was failing.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.634
You saved them, Will.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.297
You and the <i>Enterprise.</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:05.072
The Romulans were... impressed
to say the least.

14:05.143 --> 14:08.078
After years of distrust
and conflict

14:08.113 --> 14:10.581
they started to talk.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.481
You were our key spokesman

14:12.517 --> 14:15.611
in securing the alliance
with the Romulans.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.316
How far have
these negotiations progressed?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.619
The preliminaries are over.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.092
All we need do now is escort
the Romulan Ambassador

14:22.127 --> 14:23.094
to the final session.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.288
Where you will complete
the negotiations

14:25.330 --> 14:26.422
and sign the treaty.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.434
Captain...

14:29.468 --> 14:32.437
Admiral

14:32.471 --> 14:35.463
l am in no condition
to negotiate with the Romulans

14:35.507 --> 14:36.701
or with anyone else.

14:36.742 --> 14:39.210
Will, you're sound
of mind and body.

14:39.244 --> 14:40.575
lf you are properly briefed

14:40.612 --> 14:43.479
you'll still be able
to fulfill your duty.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.109
With a 16-year gap in my head?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.449
We do need you.

14:52.824 --> 14:58.558
Sir, l'm not fit
to resume command.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.326
l appreciate your candor

15:00.365 --> 15:04.563
but despite your condition,
there is no one better equipped

15:04.603 --> 15:07.231
to deal with the Romulans
than you.

15:14.112 --> 15:15.773
When do we leave?

15:15.814 --> 15:19.580
As soon as the Ambassador
transports over from the <i>Decius.</i>

15:19.618 --> 15:24.681
We will get through this...
as we have many times before.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.087
l hope so.

15:30.128 --> 15:33.097
Let me take you
to your quarters.

15:33.131 --> 15:34.598
Good idea.

15:34.633 --> 15:38.296
l've had enough surprises
for one day.

15:47.679 --> 15:50.045
Anything familiar?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.954
Hi, Dad.

16:09.601 --> 16:13.332
...and then Mr. Greenburg
asked about the Fornax Disaster

16:13.372 --> 16:15.863
and l knew the <i>Enterprise</i>
saved all the colonists

16:15.907 --> 16:18.740
but l didn't know...

16:18.777 --> 16:20.768
Ah, here it is.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.380
But l didn't know
the exact stardate

16:26.418 --> 16:28.249
of when their sun went nova.

16:28.286 --> 16:30.584
So if you tell it to me,
l'll write it down

16:30.622 --> 16:32.783
and that way
l won't forget.

16:37.796 --> 16:41.493
You don't remember me, do you?

16:43.301 --> 16:44.632
l'm sorry.

16:44.669 --> 16:48.332
l need to talk
to your father, Jean-Luc.

16:48.373 --> 16:50.864
Would you mind leaving us alone
just for a moment?

17:04.289 --> 17:06.587
Why didn't you warn me?

17:06.625 --> 17:09.890
Beverly hoped
that meeting him like this

17:09.928 --> 17:13.420
might make an impact--
help you remember.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.059
Well, it made an impact,
all right.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.296
Give it time.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.507
Jean-Luc.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.738
Yes.

17:26.778 --> 17:30.942
The Admiral was very pleased
when you chose that name.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.016
He's a wonderful boy.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.784
Deanna...

17:44.796 --> 17:47.492
who's his mother?

17:51.470 --> 17:53.597
She died two years ago.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.473
A shuttle accident.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.741
l'm sorry, Will.

18:06.251 --> 18:10.051
l have no recollection
of her at all.

18:10.088 --> 18:13.751
What was she like?

18:15.760 --> 18:18.820
Min was beautiful

18:18.864 --> 18:20.889
of course.

18:20.932 --> 18:22.160
Strong

18:22.200 --> 18:25.533
intelligent, patient.

18:25.570 --> 18:27.902
Well, she was married to me.

18:27.939 --> 18:29.907
She had to be patient.

18:29.941 --> 18:33.069
She was
an excellent Captain's wife

18:33.144 --> 18:36.079
and a very good
ship's Counselor.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.984
She took over after l left.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.509
l can't imagine
you leaving the <i>Enterprise.</i>

18:44.289 --> 18:48.248
Admiral Picard
offered me a position

18:48.293 --> 18:50.591
at Starfleet Command.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.087
lt was a tremendous opportunity.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.794
l couldn't refuse.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.033
But what's important
right now, today

19:02.073 --> 19:06.066
is that you have a son
who needs you.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.177
Spend time with him.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.742
You may find part
of what you've lost.

19:34.764 --> 19:36.391
Pretty bad, huh?

19:36.433 --> 19:37.559
l've heard better.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.231
l've been practicing

19:40.270 --> 19:42.397
but l... l still
can't get a good tone.

19:42.439 --> 19:43.838
You're putting
too much pressure

19:43.873 --> 19:44.840
on the mouthpiece.

19:44.874 --> 19:45.841
Relax the embouchure.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.433
Don't use any muscles
you don't need.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.445
Show me again.

19:51.114 --> 19:54.106
Left hand, right hand.

20:08.798 --> 20:10.766
16 years, you'd think
l'd be able to hit that note.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.926
Come on, Dad.

20:11.968 --> 20:13.868
You always make that mistake.

20:19.809 --> 20:22.437
Computer, summarize
service record

20:22.479 --> 20:24.606
Riker, William T., Captain.

20:24.647 --> 20:27.115
Begin with the Fornax Disaster.

20:27.150 --> 20:28.947
Please restate question.

20:28.985 --> 20:33.115
Service record,
Riker, William T.

20:33.156 --> 20:35.147
Damn it.

20:36.826 --> 20:37.793
Dad?

20:37.827 --> 20:39.294
Computer lag.

20:39.329 --> 20:43.095
l can't believe Geordi's
still running his diagnostic.

20:47.137 --> 20:48.627
ls, um, that what you wanted?

20:48.671 --> 20:50.298
Picard to Captain Riker.

20:50.340 --> 20:51.807
The Romulan Ambassador

20:51.841 --> 20:54.742
is ready to transport
over from the <i>Decius.</i>

20:54.778 --> 20:55.904
On my way.

20:55.945 --> 20:57.071
l've got to go.

20:57.113 --> 20:58.580
Sure.

20:58.615 --> 21:00.446
Dad?

21:00.483 --> 21:02.974
Everything's going to be fine.

21:07.390 --> 21:08.379
-Thanks.
-Bye.

21:09.392 --> 21:10.586
Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc.

21:10.627 --> 21:13.755
How is my namesake
holding up to all this?

21:13.797 --> 21:15.264
Better than l am.

21:15.298 --> 21:16.959
We did our best to prepare him.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.934
l'm trying to catch up
with all this.

21:18.968 --> 21:21.732
l've still got a long way
to go-- a long way.

21:21.771 --> 21:23.762
Just follow my lead
with the Ambassador.

21:23.807 --> 21:24.933
You'll be fine.

21:24.974 --> 21:26.100
The <i>Decius</i> reports

21:26.142 --> 21:28.770
the Ambassador is
waiting to transport.

21:28.812 --> 21:30.973
Beam him aboard.

21:38.321 --> 21:40.619
Admiral Picard, Captain Riker.

21:40.657 --> 21:42.682
lt's good to see you again.

21:42.725 --> 21:46.024
Ambassador Tomalak,
welcome aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

21:46.062 --> 21:47.086
Thank you, Admiral.

21:47.130 --> 21:49.530
lt is an honor
to be the first Romulan

21:49.566 --> 21:52.364
to freely walk
about a Federation starship.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.704
Ambassador Tomalak?

21:59.742 --> 22:01.334
At Nelvana lll, he threatened

22:01.377 --> 22:03.572
to take the hull
of the <i>Enterprise</i> home

22:03.613 --> 22:04.637
as a war trophy.

22:04.681 --> 22:07.241
That was a long time ago.

22:07.283 --> 22:11.219
Many things have changed,
including Tomalak.

22:14.290 --> 22:17.191
As soon as we arrive
at your Outpost 23

22:17.227 --> 22:19.252
the final negotiations
should go quickly.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.455
l agree, Ambassador.

22:20.497 --> 22:22.089
All of the difficult issues
have been resolved.

22:22.198 --> 22:23.426
After much debate.

22:23.466 --> 22:26.435
Your Captain Riker
is the kind of negotiator

22:26.469 --> 22:28.664
even the Ferengi should avoid.

22:28.705 --> 22:31.765
But we have come to an agreement
both sides are happy with.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.332
Largely thanks to Captain Riker.

22:33.376 --> 22:34.775
And we are grateful, Captain.

22:34.811 --> 22:38.110
The new alliance
will greatly benefit my people.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.945
As l hope it will benefit mine.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.644
Oh, it will, Captain, it will.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.823
Main Bridge.

22:50.860 --> 22:53.124
The virus you contracted,
Captain--

22:53.229 --> 22:54.355
have you fully recovered?

22:54.397 --> 22:56.388
l assure you,
Captain Riker is quite well.

22:56.432 --> 22:57.899
He is looking forward

22:57.934 --> 23:00.459
to attending the final
negotiations as planned.

23:00.503 --> 23:01.800
Excellent.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.740
The signing of this treaty
is an historic occasion.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.869
You, of all people,
deserve to be there.

23:08.912 --> 23:12.177
Thank you... Ambassador.

23:17.620 --> 23:21.249
So this is the Bridge
of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

23:21.291 --> 23:23.054
And this, l assume

23:23.092 --> 23:25.754
is your tactical position?

23:25.795 --> 23:27.262
lmpressive.

23:27.297 --> 23:28.730
Excuse me.

23:28.765 --> 23:31.757
Admiral, Deanna,
l need a moment with you.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.098
Commander Data, if you would

23:33.203 --> 23:35.228
accompany the Ambassador
on his... tour?

23:35.271 --> 23:36.704
Certainly, sir.

23:36.739 --> 23:38.639
Excuse us, Ambassador.

23:41.377 --> 23:43.607
Ambassador, you may find
this of interest.

23:43.646 --> 23:45.273
These newly refined sensors

23:45.315 --> 23:47.943
are capable of pinpointing
power emissions

23:47.984 --> 23:50.111
of a cloaked warbird
even at warp.

23:50.153 --> 23:52.451
You say you trust Tomalak?

23:52.488 --> 23:53.716
l trust the process

23:53.756 --> 23:55.724
we have built
with the Romulans

23:55.758 --> 23:57.385
over the past four years.

23:57.427 --> 23:59.918
They have nothing
to gain by betrayal.

23:59.963 --> 24:01.123
Are you sure?

24:01.197 --> 24:04.064
You've always said it's
a chess game with the Romulans--

24:04.100 --> 24:05.931
move, countermove,
guile and deceit.

24:05.969 --> 24:09.234
l sense no such dishonesty
in Tomalak.

24:09.272 --> 24:11.900
His desire for peace is sincere.

24:11.941 --> 24:13.909
He wants this alliance.

24:13.943 --> 24:16.571
There's no cause for concern.

24:16.613 --> 24:18.240
No cause for concern?

24:18.281 --> 24:21.910
We're talking about revealing
the location of Outpost 23--

24:21.951 --> 24:25.079
the key to all of our defenses
in the Neutral Zone.

24:25.188 --> 24:26.416
l'm sorry, Will.

24:26.456 --> 24:28.924
Your information is out of date.

24:28.958 --> 24:32.587
The strategic importance
of Outpost 23 is minimal.

24:32.629 --> 24:34.096
Has been for years.

24:34.163 --> 24:35.926
Dr. Crusher to Riker.

24:35.965 --> 24:37.762
Are you there, Captain?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.097
What is it, Doctor?

24:39.135 --> 24:40.864
Your son has been injured.

24:40.903 --> 24:43.098
He's been taken to Sick Bay.

24:43.172 --> 24:45.470
You'd better come down here
right away.

24:51.481 --> 24:52.448
Dad.

24:52.482 --> 24:54.006
Are you all right?

24:54.050 --> 24:55.017
l'm fine.

24:55.051 --> 24:56.279
What happened?

24:56.319 --> 24:57.581
lt's broken

24:57.620 --> 25:01.249
but it's going to be
all right in just a minute.

25:01.291 --> 25:05.785
Now, let's go easy on this arm
for a little while, okay?

25:05.828 --> 25:07.523
How did this happen?

25:07.563 --> 25:09.360
l was in the gym...

25:09.399 --> 25:11.367
playing parrises squares.

25:11.401 --> 25:12.868
Parrises squares?

25:12.902 --> 25:14.699
l fell off the ramp.

25:14.737 --> 25:18.070
At your age, you could
break your neck!

25:18.174 --> 25:19.072
l'm sorry.

25:19.175 --> 25:20.608
l didn't mean to.

25:20.643 --> 25:22.577
Continue
the compression attenuator

25:22.612 --> 25:24.011
for another two minutes.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.014
Yes, Doctor.

25:25.048 --> 25:26.743
Can l talk to you for a moment?

25:28.584 --> 25:30.245
l'll be right back.

25:32.555 --> 25:33.715
Will, how old were you

25:33.756 --> 25:36.224
when you first started
playing parrises squares?

25:36.259 --> 25:40.093
All right. l was probably
a little younger than he is.

25:40.129 --> 25:43.098
lt's just that,
for all practical purposes

25:43.132 --> 25:46.101
this is my first day as a father
and he almost kills himself.

25:46.202 --> 25:48.102
He didn't almost kill himself.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.695
He just broke his wrist.

25:49.739 --> 25:53.231
Just like a lot of other boys
his age when they fall.

25:53.276 --> 25:54.834
You're right.

25:54.877 --> 25:56.708
lt's difficult.

25:56.746 --> 25:58.976
Difficult for you.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.846
What about for Jean-Luc?

26:00.883 --> 26:03.852
Can you imagine how he feels?

26:03.886 --> 26:05.513
You've lost 16 years.

26:05.555 --> 26:09.047
Jean-Luc has lost
a lot more than that.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.922
First, his mother...

26:10.960 --> 26:12.723
and now, his father.

26:18.568 --> 26:19.796
Good as new, Captain.

26:19.836 --> 26:21.064
You can take him home.

26:21.104 --> 26:23.538
Thanks.

26:23.573 --> 26:25.040
How's the arm?

26:25.074 --> 26:26.063
lt's fine.

26:26.175 --> 26:27.733
Dad, l'm really sorry.

26:27.777 --> 26:30.473
l mean, l know you have
more important

26:30.513 --> 26:31.571
things to do...

26:31.614 --> 26:34.310
There is nothing more
important than this, son.

26:37.787 --> 26:38.776
Captain.

26:41.657 --> 26:43.386
Deck eight.

26:43.426 --> 26:44.586
Halt.

26:45.928 --> 26:48.556
l know how hard this is for you.

26:48.598 --> 26:49.826
lt's okay, Dad.

26:49.866 --> 26:52.061
No, okay is not good enough.

26:52.101 --> 26:54.001
When l was your age

26:54.036 --> 26:57.096
my own father
wasn't there for me

26:57.140 --> 26:59.108
and l really needed him.

26:59.175 --> 27:02.406
l've often wondered
what kind of father l'd be.

27:02.445 --> 27:05.414
l never felt quite ready.

27:06.582 --> 27:09.176
The idea even scared me
a little.

27:09.218 --> 27:10.685
Scared?

27:10.720 --> 27:11.687
You?

27:11.721 --> 27:14.053
Yeah.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.524
But l guess l got over it--
you're here.

27:18.694 --> 27:19.888
Resume.

27:23.232 --> 27:24.699
lt's important to me

27:24.734 --> 27:27.328
that l don't
let you down, Jean-Luc.

27:27.370 --> 27:28.837
You never have, Dad.

27:28.871 --> 27:31.237
You've always been there for me.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.175
l'll have to take
your word for that

27:34.210 --> 27:37.077
because l don't
remember any of it--

27:37.146 --> 27:41.606
your first step,
your first tooth, nothing.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.717
And l want to remember.

27:54.630 --> 27:56.996
l guess there's
only one thing we can do.

27:57.033 --> 27:59.524
We've got to build
some new memories.

28:01.637 --> 28:03.798
l'm not sure it's still
in the memory banks

28:03.840 --> 28:04.807
but l used to have

28:04.841 --> 28:06.741
a great fishing program
on the holodeck.

28:06.776 --> 28:07.743
The Curtis Creek program?

28:07.777 --> 28:08.744
You know it.

28:08.778 --> 28:10.746
Sure, we've gone to Curtis Creek
lots of times.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.475
Would you like to go again?

28:12.515 --> 28:13.846
You bet.

28:13.883 --> 28:16.317
Well, as soon as these
negotiations are out of the way

28:16.352 --> 28:17.614
you and l are going fishing.

28:17.653 --> 28:19.711
Great.

28:19.844 --> 28:22.506
...and then Mom tried
to net the fish

28:22.547 --> 28:24.879
and she fell in the creek, too.

28:24.916 --> 28:27.476
And then you tried
to pull us both out

28:27.519 --> 28:28.884
and you fell in.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.683
l'm not sure
l want to remember that.

28:30.722 --> 28:32.519
Mom really liked Curtis Creek.

28:32.557 --> 28:36.254
We went there for picnics
and stuff lots of times.

28:37.695 --> 28:39.185
What was she like?

28:42.534 --> 28:44.866
She was great.

28:44.903 --> 28:48.430
l think of her a lot.

28:48.473 --> 28:50.964
l better go change.

29:01.152 --> 29:02.483
Computer...

29:04.823 --> 29:08.452
display family record,
Riker, William T.

29:08.493 --> 29:10.825

29:33.184 --> 29:36.950
Display family record,
Riker, Mrs. William T.

29:37.522 --> 29:40.320
Please restate request.

29:40.358 --> 29:41.723
Damn!

29:45.530 --> 29:46.588
What's wrong, Dad?

29:46.631 --> 29:49.122
The computer still
isn't working properly.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.226
l can't bring up
a visual of your mother.

29:51.269 --> 29:53.464
But l know Mom's pictures
are in there.

29:53.504 --> 29:56.735
Did you give a stardate?

29:56.774 --> 29:57.968
Computer

29:58.009 --> 30:02.844
display family record,
Riker, Mrs. William T.

30:02.881 --> 30:07.011
Home file, Stardate 58416.

30:31.242 --> 30:32.402
Min.

30:34.412 --> 30:36.209
Minuet.

30:36.247 --> 30:38.647
Mom was beautiful, wasn't she?

30:38.683 --> 30:40.412
Yes.

30:42.954 --> 30:44.683
What's wrong, Dad?

30:44.722 --> 30:46.485
La Forge to Riker.

30:46.524 --> 30:47.752
Riker here.

30:47.792 --> 30:49.350
Captain, please come
to the Bridge.

30:49.394 --> 30:50.383
On my way.

30:55.133 --> 30:56.327
What's the problem?

30:56.367 --> 30:57.994
l've had to shut down
the warp engines, Captain.

30:58.036 --> 30:59.765
Why?

30:59.804 --> 31:01.635
Antimatter containment
fields are fluctuating.

31:01.673 --> 31:03.038
lt's nothing to worry
about though.

31:03.141 --> 31:04.665
We're on the edge
of the Neutral Zone

31:04.709 --> 31:06.540
at impulse power,
and you're not concerned?

31:06.577 --> 31:08.602
l'll have the engines
back on line in no time.

31:08.646 --> 31:11.672
Like you tracked down that
faulty processing accelerator?

31:11.716 --> 31:13.513
l'm running
a level-1 diagnostic.

31:13.551 --> 31:14.518
For 30 hours?

31:14.552 --> 31:16.417
lt would never
take you more than four.

31:16.454 --> 31:20.754
You're incapable of that level
of incompetence, Mr. La Forge.

31:20.792 --> 31:24.728
Worf, where did you get
that scar?

31:24.762 --> 31:26.491
ln combat.

31:26.531 --> 31:27.828
What battle?

31:27.865 --> 31:30.026
When?

31:30.068 --> 31:32.263
Which sector?

31:32.303 --> 31:33.702
Which unit?

31:33.738 --> 31:35.899
Mr. Data, if we left immediately

31:35.940 --> 31:38.602
when would we arrive
at Outpost 23?

31:40.111 --> 31:41.442
At warp one

31:41.479 --> 31:42.605
three days, four hours...

31:42.647 --> 31:43.773
What about at warp seven?

31:44.782 --> 31:46.079
At warp eight?

31:46.117 --> 31:47.084
At warp nine?

31:47.118 --> 31:48.949
What's the matter, Data?

31:48.987 --> 31:51.455
What happened to those millions
of calculations per second?

31:51.489 --> 31:52.456
Pardon me, sir.

31:52.490 --> 31:54.822
l am experiencing
subspace interference

31:54.859 --> 31:56.451
which limits my abilities.

31:56.494 --> 31:57.791
l can't operate as quickly as...

31:57.829 --> 31:58.796
What did you say?

31:58.830 --> 32:00.525
l said l cannot operate...

32:00.565 --> 32:02.192
No, that's not what you said.

32:02.233 --> 32:03.530
You said, ''l can't.''

32:03.568 --> 32:05.035
You used a contraction,
didn't you?

32:05.103 --> 32:07.298
Sir, l can explain
if you would just give me...

32:07.338 --> 32:08.828
No, you can't.

32:08.873 --> 32:10.033
Don't even try.

32:10.074 --> 32:12.838
Captain, perhaps
it would be best if we...

32:12.877 --> 32:14.344
Shut up!

32:16.280 --> 32:17.611
l beg your pardon?

32:17.648 --> 32:18.706
l said shut up

32:18.750 --> 32:21.878
as in close your mouth
and stop talking.

32:21.919 --> 32:24.353
Will, l sense how upset you are.

32:24.389 --> 32:27.017
You're angry and impatient...

32:27.058 --> 32:29.219
Deanna, back off.

32:29.260 --> 32:34.288
Well, would anyone else
like to speak up

32:34.332 --> 32:37.392
or shall we end this charade?

32:42.407 --> 32:46.639
As you wish, Commander Riker.

32:46.677 --> 32:49.578
The charade is over.

33:03.895 --> 33:09.026
The <i>Enterprise,</i> my son--
you created it all.

33:09.133 --> 33:10.964
With the help
of our neural scanners

33:11.002 --> 33:13.027
and what you would
call a holodeck.

33:13.104 --> 33:14.537
Now, please tell me.

33:14.572 --> 33:16.767
How did you discover the truth?

33:16.808 --> 33:21.142
The future we created for you
should have been convincing.

33:21.179 --> 33:22.806
lt wasn't.

33:22.847 --> 33:25.714
There was a computer
time lag, for one thing.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.047
Unavoidable.

33:27.118 --> 33:29.985
Our scanners have
a limited response time

33:30.021 --> 33:35.049
so whenever you strayed
from our... expectations...

33:35.093 --> 33:37.186
But surely, that was
not enough to...

33:37.228 --> 33:39.196
To smash your house of cards?

33:39.230 --> 33:45.226
No, it was the visual record
of my ''wife,'' Minuet.

33:45.269 --> 33:46.600
Bad move.

33:46.637 --> 33:49.663
But we chose someone from
your past who is still alive

33:49.707 --> 33:51.937
a woman you were
extremely attracted to.

33:51.976 --> 33:53.466
Your mistake, Tomalak.

33:53.511 --> 33:57.413
Minuet was nothing more than
a computer-generated fantasy

33:57.448 --> 34:00.076
l once experienced
on another holodeck.

34:00.151 --> 34:02.711
lmpossible.

34:02.753 --> 34:07.019
ln your mind, that woman
exists physically.

34:07.058 --> 34:10.550
Your feelings toward her
remain quite passionate.

34:11.661 --> 34:15.324
She was part
of a very special program.

34:16.567 --> 34:19.900
So much effort,
so little accomplished.

34:19.937 --> 34:22.735
lf it was Outpost 23
you were after

34:22.773 --> 34:25.036
why didn't you use
your neural scanners

34:25.143 --> 34:26.610
to probe my mind?

34:26.643 --> 34:29.704
Our scanners are calibrated
for Romulan brain patterns.

34:29.746 --> 34:32.375
When it comes to human brains,
they are less efficient.

34:32.416 --> 34:33.974
There were gaps
in the information

34:34.018 --> 34:35.382
we gathered from your memory.

34:35.418 --> 34:36.408
Gaps?

34:39.157 --> 34:43.025
From what l saw, l find
that hard to believe.

34:43.060 --> 34:46.052
You recreated the <i>Enterprise--</i>

34:46.130 --> 34:50.032
the crew, every nuance,
smell, sound--

34:50.067 --> 34:52.864
with perfect accuracy.

34:52.904 --> 34:55.031
l didn't see any gaps.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.563
l don't buy it, Tomalak.

34:59.810 --> 35:01.801
We are wasting time.

35:05.316 --> 35:06.578
Bring him!

35:12.857 --> 35:15.382
When you and your colleagues
transported to this planet

35:15.426 --> 35:17.553
you were less than
a kilometer from this base.

35:17.595 --> 35:19.119
Your capture was
a simple matter.

35:19.163 --> 35:21.131
My colleagues,
where are they?

35:21.165 --> 35:23.963
We allowed them to transport
safely back to the <i>Enterprise</i>

35:24.001 --> 35:25.434
but your signal was diverted.

35:25.469 --> 35:27.562
They won't stop
looking for me, Tomalak.

35:27.605 --> 35:28.911
They already have.

35:29.044 --> 35:32.844
Please say hello to your son.

35:39.254 --> 35:40.346
Jean-Luc?

35:40.389 --> 35:42.152
That is not his name, of course

35:42.191 --> 35:43.988
nor have you ever
really met him.

35:44.026 --> 35:46.927
We merely used his image
to augment your program.

35:52.534 --> 35:53.831
What have you done to him?

35:53.869 --> 35:55.598
While l am gone, please give

35:55.637 --> 35:57.798
careful thought
to your situation.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.218
What's your name?

36:14.056 --> 36:14.988
Whoa!

36:15.057 --> 36:17.184
lf we're going
to get out of here

36:17.226 --> 36:18.921
you're going to have
to trust me.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.892
Easy.
l'm not going to hurt you.

36:24.133 --> 36:25.828
Who are you?

36:28.404 --> 36:30.531
How did you get here?

36:30.572 --> 36:32.972
My name is Will.

36:37.046 --> 36:38.411
Ethan.

36:38.447 --> 36:41.314
They brought me here
with my parents.

36:41.350 --> 36:45.446
We were at a research
station at Miridian Vl.

36:45.487 --> 36:46.476
Miridian Vl?

36:46.522 --> 36:48.956
On the edge of the Neutral Zone.

36:48.991 --> 36:51.516
l thought that was uninhabited.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.427
The station was set up
last year.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.363
Then the Romulans came.

36:56.398 --> 37:00.858
lt's odd that the <i>Enterprise</i>
wasn't advised.

37:02.871 --> 37:04.839
Where are your parents now?

37:04.873 --> 37:08.604
They took them away.

37:10.612 --> 37:12.807
Do you know why the Romulans
are keeping you here?

37:12.848 --> 37:13.872
No.

37:13.916 --> 37:17.249
l just want to get away.

37:17.286 --> 37:20.881
l'll get us out of here, Ethan.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.091
How?

37:24.126 --> 37:27.527
Even if we do get away,
they'll find us.

37:27.563 --> 37:29.929
They found me
when l escaped before.

37:29.965 --> 37:30.989
You escaped?

37:31.033 --> 37:32.398
Yes.

37:32.434 --> 37:36.302
l hid in a secret place
for weeks.

37:36.338 --> 37:40.741
They caught me
when l came out to find food.

37:42.144 --> 37:44.112
l want that information,
Commander.

37:44.146 --> 37:46.944
l want the location
of Outpost 23.

37:46.982 --> 37:49.678
Very well, l have been given

37:49.718 --> 37:53.017
permission to use whatever means
are necessary.

37:53.055 --> 37:54.022
Ethan, no!

37:54.123 --> 37:55.215
Stop him!

37:59.361 --> 38:01.693
That secret
hiding place of yours?

38:04.133 --> 38:05.532
This way!

38:11.373 --> 38:12.704
ln here!

38:54.249 --> 38:56.877
Their sensors
should have picked us up.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.216
No, they can't.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.550
l heard them.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.351
There's something
in these rocks.

39:01.390 --> 39:02.357
Heavy metals?

39:02.391 --> 39:03.380
Right.

39:06.695 --> 39:08.526
The Romulans forgot
all about this storeroom

39:08.564 --> 39:09.997
when they rebuilt their tunnels.

39:16.004 --> 39:18.336
Here, we can use these.

39:18.373 --> 39:19.499
Help me.

39:29.952 --> 39:34.946
After l escaped last time,
l mapped out all their tunnels.

39:37.826 --> 39:38.793
Supply depot.

39:38.827 --> 39:39.885
Mm-hmm.

39:39.928 --> 39:40.952
Communications

39:40.996 --> 39:42.793
living quarters and shuttle bay.

39:42.831 --> 39:45.197
How many guards
in the shuttle bay?

39:45.234 --> 39:46.826
Only two or three.

39:48.870 --> 39:50.861
lf we stole a shuttlecraft,
that would get us nowhere

39:50.906 --> 39:54.342
because the Romulans
could follow their own ship

39:54.376 --> 39:56.344
too easily.

39:56.378 --> 40:00.144
But if we broke into
their communications system

40:00.182 --> 40:03.447
we could send a message
to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

40:03.485 --> 40:05.282
Can't do that.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.881
The transmitter is on a voice-
activated security system only.

40:08.924 --> 40:10.687
Do you know whose voice
activates it?

40:10.726 --> 40:12.853
Only Ambassador Tomalak.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.956
Who?

40:15.998 --> 40:17.465
Tomalak.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.262
Ambassador Tomalak?

40:20.769 --> 40:23.602
Tomalak is a Romulan Captain.

40:23.639 --> 40:26.005
The only time
he was ever called Ambassador

40:26.041 --> 40:27.508
was in a holodeck fantasy.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.976
How do you know about that?

40:30.012 --> 40:33.641
You, uh...
you told me about him.

40:33.682 --> 40:35.513
Who are you?

40:35.550 --> 40:38.348
What is your part in all this?

40:40.355 --> 40:42.050
They've found us!

40:42.124 --> 40:44.854
But you said the sensors
didn't work in these tunnels.

40:44.893 --> 40:46.383
Uh, they must have fixed them.

40:46.428 --> 40:47.395
We've got to go.

40:47.429 --> 40:48.953
Where are we going to go, Ethan?

40:48.997 --> 40:50.259
The shuttle bay.

40:50.299 --> 40:51.596
There's still time.

40:51.633 --> 40:53.931
l've had enough.

40:53.969 --> 40:56.767
Commander,
surrender your weapon.

40:56.805 --> 40:58.170
No more games.

40:59.775 --> 41:01.743
No more fantasies.

41:01.777 --> 41:04.507
l'm not going to play anymore.

41:15.657 --> 41:17.784
lt was never the Romulans.

41:17.826 --> 41:19.726
lt was you all along, wasn't it?

41:27.469 --> 41:29.460
There is no question
about it, sir.

41:29.504 --> 41:30.493
lt is his signal.

41:30.539 --> 41:32.700
Picard to Commander Riker,
do you read me?

41:32.741 --> 41:34.971
Riker to Picard, l'm here.

41:35.010 --> 41:36.637
Are you all right?

41:36.678 --> 41:38.270
Yes, sir, l'm all right.

41:38.313 --> 41:39.610
What about Geordi and Worf?

41:39.648 --> 41:41.741
We beamed them up an hour ago.
They're fine.

41:41.783 --> 41:43.478
But we lost you
in mid-transport.

41:43.518 --> 41:44.576
Where have you been?

41:44.619 --> 41:46.143
What is going on down there?

41:46.188 --> 41:47.815
l'm not sure yet, sir.

41:47.856 --> 41:50.188
But l think
l'm about to find out.

41:50.225 --> 41:51.624
Stand by.

42:03.872 --> 42:05.339
What shall l call you?

42:05.374 --> 42:07.934
Ethan? Jean-Luc?

42:07.976 --> 42:10.706
Doesn't matter.

42:12.381 --> 42:14.941
This room, it's more
than a holodeck, isn't it?

42:14.983 --> 42:16.382
Much more.

42:16.418 --> 42:18.682
The neural scanners
read my mind.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.187
Give me anything l want--

42:20.222 --> 42:21.382
just like they tried

42:21.423 --> 42:23.414
to give you
everything you wanted.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.823
Everything l wanted?!

42:24.860 --> 42:26.657
You probed the <i>Enterprise.</i>

42:26.695 --> 42:29.994
You lured us here so you
could play games with me.

42:30.031 --> 42:31.965
l didn't want that, you did.

42:32.000 --> 42:32.967
Why?

42:33.001 --> 42:34.662
My world was invaded.

42:34.703 --> 42:37.968
My people, killed.

42:38.006 --> 42:39.473
My mother brought me here

42:39.508 --> 42:41.567
so our enemies
would never find me.

42:47.749 --> 42:49.979
They found her, didn't they?

42:53.422 --> 42:57.256
She knew that they would
never stop looking for her

42:57.292 --> 43:00.420
so she made sure
l would be safe.

43:09.938 --> 43:12.771
She left the scanners
to protect me--

43:12.808 --> 43:15.242
to give me anything l wanted.

43:15.277 --> 43:16.904
Anything?

43:16.945 --> 43:18.572
Then why did you kidnap me?

43:18.613 --> 43:20.478
l wanted you to stay.

43:20.515 --> 43:23.279
lt's been so long.

43:23.318 --> 43:28.620
l just wanted somebody... real.

43:28.657 --> 43:31.182
l thought that you'd be happy.

43:33.728 --> 43:35.320
l'm sorry.

43:39.668 --> 43:42.569
l have to return to my ship.

43:50.278 --> 43:52.542
Come with me.

43:52.581 --> 43:54.879
You don't have
to stay here anymore.

43:54.916 --> 43:57.942
You don't have
to be alone anymore.

44:04.025 --> 44:05.925
My name is Barash.

44:14.302 --> 44:17.203
To me,
you'll always be Jean-Luc.

44:20.976 --> 44:22.967
Two to transport.
