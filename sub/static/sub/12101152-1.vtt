23:31.576 --> 23:33.845

23:33.845 --> 23:36.047
That's what couples do,
that's what they do:

25:11.109 --> 25:13.845
How do you explain this
to a 2-year-old?

25:13.845 --> 25:17.282
(footsteps)

25:22.120 --> 25:24.222
- (Isabel): What's your name?

25:26.224 --> 25:28.727
- It's Dara.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.798
- She's gonna be 4 soon, right?
- (Isabel): My birthday!

25:33.798 --> 25:37.469
- (Dan): Yeah.
- 4? Wow!

25:37.469 --> 25:39.871
- Do you want to come
to my party?

25:39.871 --> 25:41.873
Thérèse is baking a cake.

25:43.975 --> 25:46.778
- Oh, I would love
to come to your party.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.382
- Dad, can we go to the store?

25:50.382 --> 25:53.184
- I'm sorry, honey.
We don't have time right now.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.554
- But, Dad!
- Izz, really, we can't.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.522
- Dad!
- Hey, what did I just say?

25:57.522 --> 25:59.691
- Hey. Hey, Isabel,
can you do something for me?

25:59.691 --> 26:01.593
- What?

26:01.593 --> 26:04.262
- Can you close your eyes
for one second?

26:04.262 --> 26:06.598
Great. Thank you.

26:06.598 --> 26:10.669
If we were in the store
right now, what would you get?

26:10.669 --> 26:14.839
- Chocolate milk.
- Amazing!

26:14.839 --> 26:17.409
I love chocolate milk, too.
Haha!

26:17.409 --> 26:19.945
So, imagine

26:19.945 --> 26:22.581
you're with your dad,
and you're at the store.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.050
Are you in the store?

26:25.050 --> 26:27.085
Hey, I want you to walk
to the fridge,

26:27.085 --> 26:29.754
and I want you to take out
the chocolate milk.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.923
Are you holding it?

26:31.923 --> 26:34.526
Let me see.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.227
OK, now I want you
to open it

26:36.227 --> 26:39.230
and take a big sip.

26:39.230 --> 26:42.467
Now, keep your eyes closed.
You're in the store, remember?

26:42.467 --> 26:44.436
Now, open it

26:44.436 --> 26:46.705
and take a big sip.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.079
How does it taste?

26:54.079 --> 26:56.047
- So good.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.049
(chuckling)
(door closing)

26:58.049 --> 27:00.719
(second door closing)

27:04.089 --> 27:07.926
- I'm so glad you made it.
- Oh, I was just going.

27:07.926 --> 27:10.261
- Are you coming back?

27:10.261 --> 27:13.298
- Of course, sweetheart.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.500
- Well, let me

27:15.500 --> 27:17.636
walk you out then.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.548
I understand
where this puts you.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.556
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.860
And I want you
to feel welcome here.

27:41.860 --> 27:45.363
OK? I want to help.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.999
It's so important that
Isabel knows who her mother is.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.773
But I'm here too.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.778
- I can see that.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.114
- He was crushed, you know?

28:06.618 --> 28:08.186
- I know.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.589
- Completely.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.639

28:36.047 --> 28:38.049

28:38.049 --> 28:39.684

do you remember me

28:39.684 --> 28:41.986
from the party?
- Jordan: [Yeah, of course.]

28:41.986 --> 28:44.055
[How's it going?]

28:44.055 --> 28:46.391
(scoffing)

28:46.391 --> 28:50.662
- Um... Can we... uh...

28:50.662 --> 28:53.231
Do you want to do
something later?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.101
- (Jordan): Yeah, for sure.
Come over. I'll cook.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.970
- Really?
- Jordan: [Yeah.]

29:02.741 --> 29:05.310
(indistinct song playing
in the background)

29:10.215 --> 29:13.451
And I fight with my dad
all the time.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.253
It's why I decided
to come to school here:

29:15.253 --> 29:17.355
to get away.

29:17.355 --> 29:20.091
- How come?

29:20.091 --> 29:23.261
- 'Cause he doesn't listen.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.630
- Well, how do you
talk to him?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.402
Maybe try talking to him

29:31.402 --> 29:34.572
in a way that you think
that he can hear.

29:34.572 --> 29:37.776
- Why do I have to be
the one to change?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.911
- You don't have
to change anything,

29:39.911 --> 29:42.213
but you want him
to hear you, right?

29:45.049 --> 29:46.518
- Yeah.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.555
So, where's your mom?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.925
- What?

29:53.925 --> 29:56.227
- You said you hadn't
seen her in a long time.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.964
- Uh... She's...

30:01.833 --> 30:04.636
...gone. She left
when I was 4.

30:07.572 --> 30:09.374
- What do you mean,
"She's gone"?

30:12.744 --> 30:15.847
- I don't know.
She just...

30:15.847 --> 30:17.382
left and...

30:19.284 --> 30:21.152
That's it.

30:27.859 --> 30:29.861
- Your daughter's lucky.

30:29.861 --> 30:31.996
- Mm-hmm.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.999
Why is that?

30:34.999 --> 30:36.601
- She has you.

30:39.804 --> 30:41.739
- Lucky? Yeah...

30:47.145 --> 30:48.947
- Show her something.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.484
- Like what?

30:53.484 --> 30:55.887
- She's a kid,
show her anything you want.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.560
- Why are you being
so sweet to me?

31:04.495 --> 31:07.732
- It's just spaghetti.

31:07.732 --> 31:10.401
- Spaghetti is fine by the way--
- Would it be OK if I...

31:13.071 --> 31:14.739
...kissed you?

31:25.049 --> 31:27.919
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was too much.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.988
I thought you looked at me
in a type of way...

31:40.565 --> 31:42.901
- You don't know me at all.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.887
- What is it?
What's wrong?

32:35.887 --> 32:37.822
- Did you know
that Dan is with someone?

32:41.659 --> 32:43.728
Wait. Did you?

32:43.728 --> 32:45.596
- Shh, shh! I-I...

32:45.596 --> 32:48.933
I saw her,
but I-I-I was never sure.

32:48.933 --> 32:51.302
I didn't know. I didn't know
if they were together.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.207
- She's pregnant.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.978
- I'm sorry.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.947
I... I didn't
know that, sweetheart.

33:02.947 --> 33:05.016
I would have told you
if I knew that.

take a little bit of time.

it-it-it's gonna work out.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.569

always say that?

So you were here for...?

- That's quite a while.

43:36.747 --> 43:38.716

gone for...?

- No, she hasn't.

44:21.025 --> 44:22.459
She hasn't lost any of
her teeth, she has all of them,

44:22.459 --> 44:25.295
but it's enough about her.

44:25.295 --> 44:28.666
- Any more on the way?
- What?

44:28.666 --> 44:31.535
- I'm just curious if you were
planning on having
more children.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.437
- Why is that
any of your business?

44:39.710 --> 44:41.712
- Dara. Dara!

44:44.815 --> 44:46.583
- What are you looking for?

44:53.323 --> 44:54.725
Can I have some?

44:57.528 --> 44:59.730
- How old are you?

44:59.730 --> 45:02.232
- 14. Why, when did you
start drinking?

45:04.168 --> 45:05.636
- It was 14.

45:09.039 --> 45:12.076
No, it's not a good idea.
- Dad lets me.

45:12.076 --> 45:15.579
- I doubt that's true.
- He gave me some
at a wedding once.

45:15.579 --> 45:18.549
Honestly.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.652
- Fine. A little.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.476
- I feel weird.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.946
- That means it's working.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.617
- And people like this?

45:53.617 --> 45:55.886
- Where's your mother?

45:55.886 --> 45:58.589
- I don't know.
Why do people like this stuff?

46:00.691 --> 46:03.627
- Because it's different.

46:03.627 --> 46:05.529
- And then,
what do they do?

46:08.198 --> 46:10.234
- Dance,

46:10.234 --> 46:12.903
tell secrets,

46:12.903 --> 46:14.271
cry.

- What? It's cute, no?

47:07.858 --> 47:09.860
- I found a box of stuff
in the garage.

47:09.860 --> 47:11.762
Tons of cool crap.

47:11.762 --> 47:14.498

I don't want to be cold again.

47:34.284 --> 47:35.953
- Are you OK?

47:35.953 --> 47:37.888
- I mean, it's bad

47:50.901 --> 47:53.470

47:53.470 --> 47:55.138
- Sure.

47:58.709 --> 48:01.712
It's fine, Bernie,
you can ask.

48:07.684 --> 48:09.753
- Did you get
electric shocks?

48:13.924 --> 48:15.726
- I didn't need that.

48:18.362 --> 48:21.098
- Oh. What was
the hospital like?

48:25.769 --> 48:29.740
- It was... long...

48:36.513 --> 48:38.248
...scary sometimes.

48:41.718 --> 48:44.021
- How did your mom die?

48:46.590 --> 48:48.926
- Who told you that she died?

49:00.137 --> 49:02.806
(dog barking)

49:19.623 --> 49:21.825
(crow cawing)

49:41.011 --> 49:44.047
- (Bernie): I don't feel good.
- (Audrey): What is it, sweetie?

49:51.755 --> 49:53.557
- I was drinking before
with Dara.

49:55.292 --> 49:59.129
- (Audrey): Drinking? What...
what do you mean, drinking?

49:59.129 --> 50:02.366
- Dara, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to tell. I'm sorry.

50:04.501 --> 50:06.937
- She's 14.
- Exactly. I just gave her

50:06.937 --> 50:09.106
a bit. It's like at a wedding.

50:09.106 --> 50:10.874
- (Dara's father):
This is not a wedding.

50:12.642 --> 50:15.679
- (Audrey): What did I tell you?
- Hell, what did she tell you?

50:17.647 --> 50:19.683
- (Audrey): Come.
(Dara's father sighing)

50:27.624 --> 50:29.459
(sighing)

50:44.207 --> 50:47.010
- Wha...

50:47.010 --> 50:48.545
- Dad...

50:54.418 --> 50:56.153
Say something.
- What?

50:59.022 --> 51:01.725
She wrote. What?

51:01.725 --> 51:03.760
That was over
five years ago now.

51:07.531 --> 51:09.733
She needed
something signed.

51:11.701 --> 51:13.937
- And that's her address?

51:13.937 --> 51:16.006
- (Dara's father):
Yeah, it was, it was then, yeah.

51:19.609 --> 51:21.812
- She lives an hour from here.

51:23.547 --> 51:25.515
(Dara's father sighing)

51:25.515 --> 51:28.085
Why didn't you tell me?

51:28.085 --> 51:29.986
- Dara, you were pregnant.

51:31.555 --> 51:34.091
You were starting your life.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.359
OK? We hadn't...
we hadn't spoken about her

51:36.359 --> 51:39.563
in so many years and...

51:39.563 --> 51:42.265
and she didn't ask.

51:42.265 --> 51:44.367
- Why do we tell people
that she's dead?

51:48.138 --> 51:50.707
She's not, Dad.

51:50.707 --> 51:52.542
We can't keep
living this way,

51:52.542 --> 51:54.911
just pretending and lying.

51:54.911 --> 51:57.714
- She... she left us.

51:57.714 --> 51:59.649
She left you.

52:04.821 --> 52:07.557
- Why didn't you come see me?

52:07.557 --> 52:09.025
- But I did.
- Once.

52:11.094 --> 52:14.164
You came once.
And I asked you to come back.

52:14.164 --> 52:17.400
And-and-and I needed you there
and I told you that!

52:17.400 --> 52:20.604
- And I tried, I tried.
That whole thing just felt

52:20.604 --> 52:22.572
all... just felt again like...
I don't know.

52:22.572 --> 52:24.774
- Like what, Dad? Like her?

52:24.774 --> 52:26.977
- Uh, no,
that's not what I meant.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.678
- It was.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.986
Dad...

52:38.455 --> 52:40.790
...I don't know what to do.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.926
- Just... try
to be a mother.

52:45.128 --> 52:46.530
- What?

52:48.698 --> 52:51.168
How can you say that?
Like... Like, oh, like,

52:51.168 --> 52:53.770
"try to be a mother." Like,
like... like it's a sentence!

52:53.770 --> 52:55.872
- It's a sentence.
- No, it isn't.

52:55.872 --> 52:59.309
It's a million little decisions
one after the other,

52:59.309 --> 53:01.311
after the other, after the--
- I know. OK, OK,

53:01.311 --> 53:03.780
OK. Just... All you can do

53:03.780 --> 53:06.082
is your best, sweetheart. OK?

53:25.001 --> 53:28.405
- My mom lives
only an hour from here.

53:28.405 --> 53:31.041
- That's great. Hmm...

53:32.876 --> 53:34.544
What does that mean?

53:37.314 --> 53:40.050
- I don't know.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.885
(men inside speaking
indistinctly)

53:44.588 --> 53:46.723
- Hmm... how's your girl?

53:46.723 --> 53:49.659
- She's good.

53:49.659 --> 53:51.861
- You show her something?

53:51.861 --> 53:54.130
- I did.

53:55.498 --> 53:56.900
- See?

53:59.102 --> 54:00.704
- Another party?

54:00.704 --> 54:02.906
(man speaking indistinctly)
- Mm-mm. No,

54:02.906 --> 54:05.575
just a couple buds.
We're supposed to be studying

54:05.575 --> 54:08.178
for a test
tomorrow, but...

54:08.178 --> 54:10.347
But you want to come in
and chill for a sec

54:10.347 --> 54:11.915
or stay over?

54:13.750 --> 54:17.087
(bubbling noise)
(gunshots from TV)

54:19.222 --> 54:21.258
- You know what?
I don't think

54:21.258 --> 54:23.293
that that's a good idea.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.970
But thanks. You're a sweet kid.

54:42.979 --> 54:46.783
(kids chattering and laughing)
(Dara taking a deep breath)

54:58.728 --> 55:01.998
Hi, sweetheart.
- It's my birthday!

55:01.998 --> 55:04.501
- What?! No!

55:04.501 --> 55:06.503
I didn't bring you anything.

55:06.503 --> 55:09.939
- Really?
- I had no idea.

55:09.939 --> 55:14.044
But wait, I guess
that's why I brought you this.

55:15.578 --> 55:18.948
- Uh, it's for me?
What's his name?

55:18.948 --> 55:21.184
- Well, it's a Jack Dempsey,

55:21.184 --> 55:23.687
so I thought we could call it
Jack. That's my dad's name.

55:39.969 --> 55:42.072
I'm gonna go put Jack
in some water.

and my kid in the next room, OK?

that you are sitting on.
- (Dan): OK, hey,

58:33.977 --> 58:36.513
don't speak to her like that.
- OK, Dan,

58:36.513 --> 58:38.281
you let our daughter
call this woman Mommy?

58:38.281 --> 58:41.484
What is she even doing here?
- He's not your husband.

58:41.484 --> 58:43.653
He was, but he's not anymore.
- Who are you?

58:43.653 --> 58:46.890
What are you doing in my house?!
- I'm the woman raising
your daughter!

58:46.890 --> 58:48.758
- I am her mother!
- Are you?

58:53.963 --> 58:56.332
- What, that is my mug.

58:56.332 --> 58:58.334
What are you doing
drinking out of

58:58.334 --> 59:00.003
my mug?!
- What are you doing?!

59:00.003 --> 59:02.071
What are you doing?
You're acting crazy.

59:03.973 --> 59:06.009
This is just like before;
you don't make sense, Dara!

59:06.009 --> 59:08.478
- No, I... I do.
- No, you don't!

59:08.478 --> 59:11.080
- I do, I do make sense, OK?

59:11.080 --> 59:14.851
I'm not crazy,
and I wasn't crazy before.

59:14.851 --> 59:17.687
I had her and I got sick,

59:17.687 --> 59:19.989
and this is exactly
why I had to leave:

59:19.989 --> 59:22.926
because you made me feel
like I was crazy.

59:22.926 --> 59:24.727
- How did I make you feel crazy?
- (Thérèse): Let her talk.

59:32.201 --> 59:35.905
- Look, you didn't
understand me then,

59:35.905 --> 59:37.974
and you still don't
understand me now.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.781
OK, so... so tell me,

59:44.781 --> 59:47.350
what do you do? "You get better,

59:47.350 --> 59:49.118
"and the only way
that you know how.

59:49.118 --> 59:52.121
And you do that every day
a little bit."

59:52.121 --> 59:54.424
That's what they said,
"That you can't see it,

59:54.424 --> 59:57.193
but it's there and it adds up."

59:57.193 --> 59:59.262
That's what they told me,
that it adds up.

59:59.262 --> 1:00:02.031
And so you take
what they tell you to take,

1:00:02.031 --> 1:00:04.367
even if it makes you
not you anymore,

1:00:04.367 --> 1:00:07.236
and then you feel
like you're somebody else.

1:00:07.236 --> 1:00:10.206
But you do that, and you do it
and you keep doing it

1:00:10.206 --> 1:00:12.308
until they tell you
that you're OK.

1:00:15.712 --> 1:00:18.648
Look, I went away to get better,

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:20.950
so that I could come back

1:00:20.950 --> 1:00:23.019
and be in this family
the right way...

1:00:25.555 --> 1:00:27.457
...if I'm still welcome.

1:00:39.669 --> 1:00:41.204
You didn't wait.

1:00:43.339 --> 1:00:45.274
Hey, Dan, I told you
that I was gonna come back.

1:00:45.274 --> 1:00:47.310
I promised you that, OK?

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:49.812
I'm not her.
I am not my mom!

1:00:52.015 --> 1:00:54.517
But...

1:00:56.185 --> 1:00:58.321
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry, OK?

1:00:58.321 --> 1:01:00.256
