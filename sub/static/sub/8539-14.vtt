WEBVTT

00:30.726 --> 00:31.988
[gunshots]

00:39.474 --> 00:43.173
We've got Claire Wolcott...
female, Caucasian, 32 years old.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.523
She was found shot
to death in her room.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.395
Her husband's got friends
at the governor's office

00:47.482 --> 00:49.223
so he called in some favors.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.313
He wants the investigation
to be kept discreet and low-key.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.967
His wife gets murdered
and his priority is discretion?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.497
Oh. Okay.

01:02.584 --> 01:06.457
Yup, Mrs. Wolcott
was cheating on Mr. Wolcott.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.851
Which makes Mr. Wolcott
suspect number one.

01:08.938 --> 01:12.898
Number two. Number one would
be Mrs. Wolcott's mystery lover.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.118
The room was registered
in Claire Wolcott's name

01:15.205 --> 01:16.989
so no help there.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.253
[Teresa]
'At 2:24 a.m.'

01:19.340 --> 01:22.430
hotel staff and guests
heard three gunshots

01:22.517 --> 01:24.519
but they didn't know
where they were coming from.

01:24.606 --> 01:28.088
15, 20 minutes later,
they come here and call 9-1-1.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.700
Whoa. Found a shell.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.006
- Looks like a 9-millimeter.
- And another.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.921
Mark 'em for forensics.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.793
So the lover didn't do it.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.403
Because?

01:39.490 --> 01:40.970
The, uh, shell casing things

01:41.057 --> 01:44.843
indicate the shooter
was across the room here.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.369
He or she stepped in
from outside

01:48.456 --> 01:50.240
and started blasting away.

01:50.327 --> 01:53.635
If the lover had done it, he'd
have been closer to the victim

01:53.722 --> 01:56.246
and he wouldn't have had
to shoot as many times.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.335
And look.

01:58.422 --> 02:01.382
Circular...which
means a vertical drip

02:01.469 --> 02:04.080
from someone standing
right here, bleeding. Right?

02:04.167 --> 02:06.604
Not spatter
from the victim.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.477
You're a forensics expert now.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.740
So Claire and mystery
lover are asleep.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.655
Someone comes in
through the open door

02:13.742 --> 02:15.309
shoots them, leaves.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.659
Poor lover is
woken by a bullet

02:17.746 --> 02:20.749
Claire dead next
to him. Aah! Freaks out.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.272
But nobody comes right away.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.753
Mystery lover, who is
only slightly wounded

02:24.840 --> 02:28.844
gets to thinking maybe
the best thing to do is just..

02:28.931 --> 02:31.194
...slip away, out here.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.502
[Teresa]
'You two finish up here.'

02:34.589 --> 02:35.590
[Wayne]
'Yes, boss.'

02:35.677 --> 02:36.591
[instrumental music]

02:46.862 --> 02:47.906
[music continues]

02:55.871 --> 02:57.046
Here.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.630
There you go.

03:18.676 --> 03:19.764
Pick one.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.295
Anything else?

03:28.382 --> 03:29.470
No.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.565
"Doc lady."

03:40.872 --> 03:43.701
That silver caddy
arrived last night at 2:31.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.094
Ah!

03:45.181 --> 03:46.400
That's about seven
and a half minutes

03:46.487 --> 03:47.879
after the shooting took place.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.011
Name and room number?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.669
[knocks on door]

03:57.933 --> 03:59.239
Open it.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.504
[instrumental music]

04:10.467 --> 04:11.729
Psst.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.572
Hey! Wake up.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.835
[gasps]
Oh, my God.
Who are you?

04:30.922 --> 04:33.882
It's alright, ma'am.
We're CBI.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.928
- We need to talk to you, sir.
- What's this about?

04:37.015 --> 04:40.410
- Take a wild guess.
- Put your hands in the air.

04:40.497 --> 04:41.890
Okay.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.892
I'm, uh, I'm not
under arrest, am I?

04:43.979 --> 04:46.198
'Cause I've done nothing wrong.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.375
Pants on. We'll talk after.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.034
[theme music]

05:02.867 --> 05:03.868
[instrumental music]

05:03.955 --> 05:05.217
[indistinct chattering]

05:11.702 --> 05:12.921
[knock on door]

05:13.008 --> 05:16.228
'This is Kevin Haightly,
resort manager.'

05:16.316 --> 05:19.406
Hi, um, I know we can't
expect to get the room back

05:19.493 --> 05:21.799
but when might the walkway
be open for use, do you think?

05:21.886 --> 05:24.280
That depends on when forensics
is done. We'll let you know.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.021
Okay. Thanks.

05:27.675 --> 05:31.722
It was a cold night,
so we lit a fire and made love.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.681
We went to sleep afterwards,
and suddenly there was

05:33.768 --> 05:35.944
like a sharp
pain and bang!

05:36.031 --> 05:37.598
I wake up
and there's blood everywhere

05:37.685 --> 05:38.860
and I'm shot in
the arm and Claire's dead.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.296
You know, I freaked.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.124
- You didn't see who did it?
- No.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.865
- Why'd you leave?
- Claire was dead.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.649
I couldn't help her
and I couldn't help you guys.

05:45.736 --> 05:48.522
I didn't see anything, so..

05:48.609 --> 05:51.133
...you know,
what could I contribute?

05:54.789 --> 05:57.400
- She's a married woman.
- Yeah, we know that.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.271
And Jill Rubenstein
what's your connection with her?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.969
The doctor lady?

06:01.056 --> 06:03.188
I met her in the parking lot
and asked her for help.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.800
A complete stranger
takes you to her room

06:05.887 --> 06:08.150
treats your wound and then has
sexual intercourse with you?

06:08.237 --> 06:11.458
What can I say? The Hippocratic
Oath is a beautiful thing.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.155
How well did you
know Claire Wolcott?

06:13.242 --> 06:15.331
Uh, I don't really
know her that well.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.724
Met her just a few weeks ago.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.421
She was at a bar,
and I picked her up.

06:18.508 --> 06:21.381
Since then, I've seen
her occasionally for sex.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.860
Is that what
happened last night?

06:22.947 --> 06:24.471
Yeah.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.298
I called and asked
her to meet me for a drink.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.474
We came here.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.910
Did anybody else
know you were here?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.868
Nobody. Just me and Claire.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.609
[Teresa]
'And how long had
you been in the room?'

06:32.696 --> 06:35.569
Um...few hours.

06:35.656 --> 06:39.268
I'd agreed to, uh,
you know, stay the night.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.530
I was fond of Claire

06:40.617 --> 06:42.967
and it's a long drive
home, so I stayed.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.186
I don't normally do that.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.754
No? What-what's
your normal procedure?

06:46.841 --> 06:49.452
After lovemaking?
Depends on the type of woman.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.149
So you've got it
down to a science.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.630
I'm good at what I do.

06:53.717 --> 06:57.852
Okay, Mr. Fricke,
and what is it that you do?

06:57.939 --> 07:00.289
- I'm a pickup artist.
- Mm.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.552
A, uh, woman whisperer,
if you will.

07:02.639 --> 07:06.382
A pickup artist,
that's your profession?

07:06.469 --> 07:08.906
[scoffs]
You sound like my mom.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.822
Um, it's more of a total
lifestyle kind of thing.

07:11.909 --> 07:15.086
You know? I-I practice my art,
of course. That's my passion.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.524
But I teach and I blog also.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.352
Um, conduct seminars,
workshops, that sort of thing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.659
- Is that good money?
- Not bad.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.531
And do you take money
from the women you pick up?

07:24.618 --> 07:26.533
Sometimes, when I need to.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.360
Did you take money
from Claire Wolcott?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.712
No. No. Like I say,
I was fond of Claire.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.757
Um, I planned
to see her again.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.499
You really only want
to monetize as an exit strategy.

07:36.586 --> 07:40.503
Paul, is your mother
still alive?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.766
I know where you're going
with this, Dr. Freud?

07:42.853 --> 07:44.768
And, uh, you're wrong.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.335
My mom's dead, as it goes

07:46.422 --> 07:50.905
but, uh, I loved her dearly,
and she loved me.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.647
Who said anything
about your mother?

07:53.734 --> 07:55.910
- You just did.
- No, I didn't.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.085
- Yes, you did.
- Didn't.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.478
What are you talking about?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.523
I'm just kidding.
Just playing with you, Paul.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.482
Just kidding, mucking around.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.048
Yeah. Are we done here?

08:04.135 --> 08:07.269
Do you know who killed Claire?

08:07.356 --> 08:09.140
No.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.751
Interesting.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.535
He's either a habitual liar
telling the truth

08:12.622 --> 08:15.451
or he's an honest man lying.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
Do you keep a list,
of your pickups?

08:17.627 --> 08:22.502
Yeah, of course.
I, uh, I have 'em here.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.635
Names, numbers
and a 1 to 10 grading system.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.333
Nice. Something to show
your grandkids.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.553
We're gonna need you to forward
a copy of that list to us.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.512
Oh. Yeah, sure.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.863
What, you think maybe
this was a jealous ex-lover?

08:35.950 --> 08:37.473
Could be.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.042
Wow.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.653
I say we bring him in anyway,
for creepiness.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.438
Well, it should be
a criminal offense, but isn't.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.615
He could have shot her, then
shot himself to cover it up.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.355
Or he simply could have
shot her and left.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.706
He didn't have the gun on him,
and the local PD searched

08:52.793 --> 08:55.230
every inch of this place and
found nothing. He's clean.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.361
Maybe someone was
trying to kill him.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.015
- Not her.
- Not likely.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.887
The room was registered
in Claire Wolcott's name.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.367
- Nobody else knew he was there.
- What was she thinking?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.935
She was so beautiful,
and he's so...creepy.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.547
Yeah, that Dr. Rubenstein
was hot, too. How does he do it?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.070
All you need is
a basic understanding

09:09.157 --> 09:11.115
of the evolutionary
psychology of women

09:11.202 --> 09:13.030
rigorously
and fearlessly applied.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.728
You gotta know
what buttons to press.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.339
- Like we're toasters?
- Like men don't have buttons?

09:17.426 --> 09:21.604
Men are like toasters. Women...
little more like, a-accordions.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.127
[instrumental music]

09:27.654 --> 09:29.133
I thought that was
a compliment.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.050
Mr. Wolcott.
Thank you for coming.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.575
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
The effects you requested..

09:37.359 --> 09:39.622
...photos, video of Claire.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.581
We'll return this to you
as soon as possible.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.801
I was just upstairs
speaking with my friend

09:44.888 --> 09:47.282
the attorney general, and I
told him that I will not rest

09:47.369 --> 09:48.936
until the man who did this
is brought to justice.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.502
I will not rest.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.027
I know I can expect the same
from you and your people.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.769
I assure you this unit
does the best we can

09:55.856 --> 09:57.335
with every case we run.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.121
Cho?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.733
If it's convenient,
Agent Cho would like

10:03.820 --> 10:05.822
to ask you a few questions.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.001
Hi.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.097
When did you speak
to your wife last?

10:20.184 --> 10:21.795
I was in San Francisco
on a business dinner.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.884
I called Claire
around midday.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.408
Told her I'll probably
be staying in town that night.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.018
Did you stay
the night in town?

10:28.105 --> 10:29.846
I did.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.587
Did she say where she was going
or who she was meeting?

10:31.674 --> 10:32.980
No, but I didn't ask.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.677
So you didn't know
she was at the spa?

10:34.764 --> 10:37.201
I wouldn't expect to know. She
often went up there on a whim.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.377
Can you think of anyone
who held a grudge against her?

10:39.464 --> 10:43.773
No. No, she was,
um...harmless.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.080
Any friends or family
that might be in any trouble?

10:46.167 --> 10:48.865
She's from back east, doesn't
have any family or friends here.

10:48.952 --> 10:53.087
She...shopped and she played
tennis and she went to the spas.

10:53.174 --> 10:56.220
No one would have
any motives..

10:57.439 --> 10:58.396
Yes?

11:00.398 --> 11:02.139
I recall she fired
an assistant last month

11:02.226 --> 11:03.314
caught her stealing jewelry.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.446
I believe she was
pressing charges.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.013
Name?

11:06.100 --> 11:09.103
Natalie...something.
My people will have her details.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.457
Are you aware that
on the night of her murder

11:15.544 --> 11:17.894
your wife was
meeting a lover?

11:19.113 --> 11:20.680
Yes.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.378
The local authorities
told me they suspected as much.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.641
Did you know she had a lover?
Prior to her death, I mean.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.644
No...Do you have a name?
I mean, is he a suspect?

11:28.731 --> 11:30.385
We have a name.
He's not a suspect.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.300
- Who is he?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.563
- I want his name.
- You can't have it.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.739
Are you sure, Agent Cho,
because I can make

11:36.826 --> 11:39.350
one phone call
and your career is toast.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.874
That's impressive.
The best I can get

11:40.961 --> 11:42.397
with one call is a pizza.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.138
Now this business dinner
you were at in San Francisco

11:44.225 --> 11:47.010
what's the timing on that,
and who else was there?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.578
My people can give you
times, names and numbers.

11:49.665 --> 11:50.622
We're done here.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.626
Thanks for your cooperation.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.587
[indistinct chattering]

12:00.458 --> 12:02.330
Say hi.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.511
Claire Wolcott
was so pretty.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.732
What did you see?

12:14.864 --> 12:17.693
[sighs]
Nice shoes, loneliness.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.697
Where we going?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.270
[knocks on door]

12:33.143 --> 12:35.232
- Natalie Edreau?
- Yes?

12:35.319 --> 12:37.147
We're with the CBI.
Can we come in?

12:37.234 --> 12:38.583
Look, I already told the cops

12:38.670 --> 12:40.020
I didn't steal anything
from that bitch.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.457
By "bitch," are you
referring to Claire Wolcott?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.111
Yeah. So?

12:44.198 --> 12:47.636
Uh...she was
murdered last night.

12:47.723 --> 12:48.942
[instrumental music]

12:58.386 --> 13:00.301
How long did you work
for Claire Wolcott?

13:00.388 --> 13:02.956
About a year...
till she turned psycho.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.088
She claimed that you stole
jewelry from her.

13:05.175 --> 13:08.265
Yeah. She was wrong.
I didn't steal anything.

13:08.352 --> 13:11.529
Claire pressed charges against
you. How'd that make you feel?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.575
[Natalie]
'Excuse me, are you trying to
say that I killed her?'

13:13.662 --> 13:15.185
Do you own a gun, Natalie?

13:15.272 --> 13:17.231
[scoffs]
'Oh, my God.
This is really stupid.'

13:17.318 --> 13:19.407
Um, no, I don't own a gun.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.235
And, no, I didn't kill Claire.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.540
Where were you last night?

13:22.627 --> 13:24.151
I was hanging out
with my roommate

13:24.238 --> 13:26.109
till about 9:00 or so.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.677
And, uh, then
I went out for dinner.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.985
What'd you have?
For dinner?

13:32.072 --> 13:33.290
What does that have
to do with anything?

13:36.206 --> 13:37.817
The chopped salad
at Pastucci's.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.949
Ah. Yes.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.342
There's something
on this side of the room

13:41.429 --> 13:44.084
you don't want us
to find. What is that?

13:44.171 --> 13:45.520
Nothing. There's nothing.

13:45.607 --> 13:49.393
Look me in the eye
and say that.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.178
Whatever. Search all you want.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.615
Meh. Too much stuff.
You're not very tidy.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.791
Good in bed I expect, yeah?

13:55.878 --> 13:57.271
[scoffs]

13:57.358 --> 13:59.664
Messy women
make good lovers.

13:59.751 --> 14:00.883
- Can I hold your hand?
- I--

14:00.970 --> 14:02.537
Shush.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.843
[instrumental music]

14:17.030 --> 14:19.815
Hmm-m-m.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.034
[clears throat]

14:23.427 --> 14:25.038
[humming]

14:31.696 --> 14:32.654
Camera.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.266
- Okay, those are personal, so--
- Ooh.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.145
Uh-huh.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.711
Is it..

14:46.798 --> 14:50.063
Claire Wolcott
and her lover Paul Fricke..

14:50.150 --> 14:53.849
...time-stamped two hours
before the murder.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.687
These are the photos we pulled
from your digital camera.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.731
A couple hours
after these were taken

15:06.818 --> 15:07.819
Claire Wolcott was dead.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.473
That doesn't prove anything.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.345
Opportunity and motive.
You were close by when she died.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.129
And the theft charge
she laid on you dies with her.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.478
That was
a garbage charge anyway.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.653
- I wasn't worried about that.
- No?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.742
No.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.831
You didn't steal
jewelry from her?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.616
Please. She dressed like
a Mormon call girl.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.096
I wouldn't want
her jewelry if you paid me.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.532
I didn't ask if
you wore her jewelry.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.186
- I asked if you stole it.
- No, I didn't.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.622
Why were you
photographing her?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.583
Now think this through, Natalie.
We're investigating murder.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.281
If you have
an explanation for these

15:34.368 --> 15:35.673
that doesn't involve killing
her, you should tell us

15:35.760 --> 15:38.024
get yourself off the hook.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.591
I thought if I threatened
to tell her husband

15:40.678 --> 15:43.072
about the affair, then she
would drop the theft charges.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.769
That's what the pictures
are for.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.467
How did you know
she was having an affair?

15:46.554 --> 15:49.209
It was obvious. She kept sending
me out to buy men's gifts.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.298
You know, like,
watches and ties.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.343
I knew it wasn't for
her husband. I'm not an idiot.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.258
What did Claire say when
you confronted her about it?

15:55.345 --> 15:57.565
I didn't confront her about it.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.784
She left with that fugly guy
before I got the chance.

15:59.871 --> 16:00.916
Probably wouldn't have
worked anyway.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.570
Why not?

16:02.657 --> 16:06.182
Because Keith Wolcott
is, like, super controlling

16:06.269 --> 16:08.663
specially about money.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.534
He probably knew all along
his wife was sleeping around.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.234
[sighs]

16:18.760 --> 16:20.370
[telephone ringing]

16:20.457 --> 16:22.329
- What's the verdict?
- I'm not liking her for this.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.375
We should talk to the roommate,
make sure her alibi stands up.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.986
The husband,
on the other hand

16:27.073 --> 16:28.422
he is the type to know
about his wife's affairs.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.076
His business dinner
in San Francisco, Cho.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.034
Couldn't have made it back
to Calistoga to kill her.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.384
He's the type that'll hire other
people to do his dirty work.

16:34.471 --> 16:35.864
Yes, he is,
hit men aren't cheap

16:35.951 --> 16:37.083
and they
don't take credit cards.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.867
I'll look
into Mr. Wolcott's finances.

16:38.954 --> 16:41.565
Boring.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.786
Okay, Mr. Entertainment.
What do you want to do?

16:47.354 --> 16:49.095
I wanna go back
to the crime scene.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.141
That hotel room. There is
something that just isn't right.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.972
Hey.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.279
You're up.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.932
[sighs]
Great.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.373
Something's not quite right.

17:10.551 --> 17:14.076
Don't take too long.
I'm hungry.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.382
[door opens]

17:17.253 --> 17:18.602
[door locks]

17:21.649 --> 17:22.954
[doorknob rattling]

17:25.131 --> 17:26.480
[knocks on glass]

17:30.875 --> 17:32.573
Let's go eat.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.140
[door locks]

17:42.365 --> 17:45.368
Good to see you again.
So...is there any news?

17:45.455 --> 17:46.630
The owner keeps asking me
when we'll be able to

17:46.717 --> 17:47.849
reopen the villa.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.720
No news.
We're here for lunch.

17:49.807 --> 17:53.420
Oh. Absolutely. Um..

17:53.507 --> 17:55.074
...one moment.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.385
Oh, look who's here.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.648
Ah, just the man.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.650
I have a question
I need to ask him.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.783
Right this way.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.437
[male #1]
'It's good, huh?'

18:13.092 --> 18:16.095
- Oh. Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.229
[instrumental music]

18:22.362 --> 18:24.059
[indistinct murmuring]

18:27.758 --> 18:29.673
Katie?

18:29.760 --> 18:31.240
Table four needs
fresh drinks, okay?

18:31.327 --> 18:32.633
Yes, sir.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.470
Hey!

18:43.557 --> 18:46.864
My old friends from the CBI.
Come, have a seat.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.089
Surprised to see you
back here so soon.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.352
It's my number one
hunting ground.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.485
Loaded with
my kind of women.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.575
Beautiful, rich,
married and unhappy.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.838
So you specialize?

19:03.925 --> 19:05.666
Sure. Yeah.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.495
Some guys will tell ya hot,
young singles are the real test.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.019
'But I'm not in this to win
a points contest, you know?'

19:11.106 --> 19:14.065
Plus, I like the gratitude
you get from the older ladies.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.980
A woman died, a woman
that you were close to.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.982
Doesn't that give you pause?

19:18.069 --> 19:20.550
Sure it does.
Yeah, I have feelings.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.335
But having this gunshot wound.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.250
- Genius opener.
- An opener?

19:24.337 --> 19:28.254
You know, a prop or a line
you use to start a conversation.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.473
You can't just go up and say,
"Hey, what's your name?"

19:30.560 --> 19:34.042
- No?
- Duh.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.218
So how do you do it exactly?
You know, pick up women.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.829
- Need some help, huh?
- No.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.745
Big handsome dude like you,
I got a few basic techniques

19:41.832 --> 19:44.052
that will turn you into
a freakin' sex machine.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.662
A machine.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.099
Well, I'm not looking
to be a "machine" so much.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.972
I'm more of a steady
relationship kind of guy.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.582
When you're scoring
with a different super fox

19:52.669 --> 19:55.194
every night, what do
you want a relationship for?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.934
Did you ever fall in love
with any of these

19:57.021 --> 19:59.502
different super foxes
you score with?

19:59.589 --> 20:01.983
No, never.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.115
Love is for guys
who can'tget laid.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.682
Oh.

20:05.769 --> 20:09.164
So, uh, what's
your basic technique?

20:09.251 --> 20:11.079
Oh, there are a thousand ways
to seduce a woman.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.473
'All kinds
of workable systems.'

20:13.560 --> 20:16.954
But they all boil down
to three words

20:17.041 --> 20:20.567
"contempt," "control,"
"excitement."

20:20.654 --> 20:23.700
"Contempt," "control,"
"e-excitement"?

20:28.183 --> 20:30.533
Women want men
that don't need or want them.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.839
They want to be told
what to do

20:31.926 --> 20:33.971
and they want edge,
adventure, drama

20:34.058 --> 20:35.625
whatever you wanna call it.

20:35.712 --> 20:39.238
Present that package to them,
and they will bite.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.806
- Guaranteed.
- Ouch.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.156
[Paul]
'And then, when you have
her under your spell'

20:45.244 --> 20:47.028
then you get up and leave.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.421
- L-leave? But--
- 'No, no, no.'

20:48.508 --> 20:50.727
You leave. Trust me.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.904
Next time she sees you,
she'll tear your clothes off.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.950
Guaranteed.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.126
- What's going on with you two?
- Excuse me?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.476
You and Katie here.
You got something going on?

21:00.563 --> 21:01.564
- No!
- No.

21:04.654 --> 21:05.873
Just askin'.

21:12.749 --> 21:15.230
I used to let her sleep with me
once in a while. That's all.

21:15.317 --> 21:18.494
No, you had feelings
for her.

21:18.581 --> 21:21.845
Years ago,
maybe a little. Sure.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.195
You know, before I got
my mojo working.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.240
Hmm.

21:26.850 --> 21:27.808
Thanks for talking
to us, Paul.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.462
Uh-huh.

21:29.549 --> 21:30.724
Oh, you had one more
question you wanted to ask.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.161
Ah! Yes, that's right.
Thank you. I forgot.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.468
Uh, the night that you
were sleeping with Claire

21:35.555 --> 21:38.601
was the patio door
open or closed?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.995
Uh...closed, I think.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.301
Thank you.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.914
Okay, now I'm really hungry.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.090
- Drive-thru.
- Done.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.092
You think Fricke's right?

21:51.179 --> 21:52.876
- Was the door closed?
- Yes.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.400
It was a cold night.
They lit a fire.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.140
Why would they
leave the door open?

21:56.227 --> 21:58.360
No, I mean, is he right
about how to deal with women.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.883
100% wrong.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.059
Unless, of course, you wanna
have a lot of casual sex

22:02.146 --> 22:03.931
with total strangers.
Then he's right.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.280
[instrumental music]

22:06.847 --> 22:08.849
When did you
first meet Paul Fricke?

22:08.936 --> 22:11.199
At a wine tasting event
a friend was throwing.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.897
And how long were you and he
romantically involved?

22:13.984 --> 22:17.553
Um...three, maybe four hours.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.772
[instrumental music]

22:21.905 --> 22:23.211
[indistinct chattering]

22:25.561 --> 22:27.868
[sighs]
So you didn't know Paul Fricke

22:27.955 --> 22:29.783
prior to agreeing
to spend the night with him?

22:29.870 --> 22:31.567
[chuckles]
No.

22:31.654 --> 22:35.223
And you haven't
spoken to him since?

22:35.310 --> 22:38.792
Whatattracted you to him
in the first place?

22:38.879 --> 22:39.923
Fourtimes?

22:42.317 --> 22:46.060
What exactly attracted you to
Paul Fricke in the first place?

22:46.147 --> 22:49.237
I don't know. I guess there was
just something about him.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.673
And were you
at all hurt or angry

22:50.760 --> 22:52.240
when the relationship ended?

22:52.327 --> 22:56.505
Mm, no. I was disappointed
more than anything.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.073
We had a wonderful
time together.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.249
Thank you for your time.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.470
Oh, you'll, um, you'll tell him
"hello" for me, won't you?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.993
Yes.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.260
Hey, how's it going?
Any potential suspects?

23:12.347 --> 23:14.218
Nope. I'm bringing in
the rest tomorrow.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.785
There's more?

23:15.872 --> 23:18.440
This is just "A" through "M"
How's it going with you?

23:18.527 --> 23:20.964
No unusual transactions
by Mr. Wolcott.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.531
But three days
before she was killed

23:22.618 --> 23:24.925
Claire Wolcott
made a $200,000 withdrawal

23:25.012 --> 23:26.709
in the form
of a cashier's check

23:26.796 --> 23:28.755
made out to none other
than Paul Fricke.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.713
Here's the best part,
according to the bank

23:30.800 --> 23:33.237
Keith Wolcott set up
the account so he'd be notified

23:33.324 --> 23:34.935
whenever a large
transaction took place.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.806
Meaning that Wolcott had to have
known about the 200 grand.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.329
Exactly.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.419
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.510
Uh...Brandy?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.730
Come on.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.519
[Keith]
'"Darn it, woman!"
said the redneck.'

23:53.606 --> 23:55.042
'"Ain't you never seen
a goat before?"'

23:55.129 --> 23:56.304
[all laughing]

23:56.391 --> 24:00.569
- He's handling his grief well.
- Mm.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.484
Excuse me, Mr. Wolcott?

24:02.571 --> 24:05.052
- Now is not a good time.
- Well, I'm sorry to intrude.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.314
We need to ask you
some follow-up questions

24:06.401 --> 24:08.055
regarding
your previous statement.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.274
I'll be happy to speak with you
tomorrow morning in my office.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.624
Oh, this won't take long.

24:11.711 --> 24:16.106
I told you,
tomorrow morning, my office.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.412
We're good.

24:21.024 --> 24:24.027
Mr. Wolcott, it's about
your wife's lover.

24:24.114 --> 24:27.248
We, uh, know about
the $200,000 she gave him

24:27.335 --> 24:29.293
and we know
that you know about it.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.860
How dare you?

24:30.947 --> 24:32.906
How dare I?
Did I do something daring?

24:36.213 --> 24:37.476
Am I supposed
to be afraid of you?

24:37.563 --> 24:39.173
You're supposed
to be respectful.

24:39.260 --> 24:43.438
Respectful? You contemptible
little buffoon.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.875
Your wife just died, and you're
swanning around in a monkey suit

24:45.962 --> 24:48.312
drinking punch and laughing
with your idiot friends

24:48.399 --> 24:51.054
and you want respect?

24:51.141 --> 24:52.708
There'syour respect.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.638
- What?
- You know damn well what.

25:09.725 --> 25:10.944
You assaulted a man.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.598
Oh, I just tweaked him
on the nose.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.295
Technically, that's assault.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.689
Technically, he's an ass.
He deserved it.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.300
Yes, he is,
but this is not a school yard.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.041
You simply cannot
do stuff like that.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.956
I did. I did it.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.480
And the seas didn't boil
and the sky didn't fall.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.221
They will shortly.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.224
Wolcott is on his way down here
with a $1,000-an-hour lawyer.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.834
If you give him
a formal apology

25:31.921 --> 25:34.576
he says he's willing to drop
the whole matter.

25:34.663 --> 25:38.275
Hmm, let me think...no.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.495
Would you please
be reasonable for once?

25:40.582 --> 25:43.019
- I'm busy.
- Right.

25:43.106 --> 25:46.327
I am, I'm just thinking
that, uh..

25:46.414 --> 25:48.677
...he's gonna drop
the whole matter in any case.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.287
- Oh, really?
- I guarantee it.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.203
He's a shallow narcissist.
It's all about image.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.555
And this whole business
makes him seem small and silly.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.254
Ooh! Ha ha ha.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.475
Contempt,
control, excitement.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.520
What?

26:05.607 --> 26:07.304
Nothing.

26:07.391 --> 26:10.307
This place is so nice.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.919
$800 a night, minimum.
Can you believe that?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.269
Huh.

26:15.356 --> 26:18.011
Hello? What, you're not
talking to me now?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.882
Barely said a word
the whole time.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.798
I'll talk to you when you have
something interesting to say.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.583
Fine. Be a jerk.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.849
[Paul]
'I'd go in, but I'd have
to keep my injury dry.'

26:29.936 --> 26:31.981
- Gunshot wound.
- 'Oh!'

26:32.068 --> 26:34.418
Don't worry.
Uh, you're not in any danger.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.595
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.817
Oh, not you guys again.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.777
The old magic not working
so good today, huh?

26:44.864 --> 26:46.648
Just like baseball.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.432
Most of the time,
even in the major leagues

26:48.519 --> 26:50.130
you, uh, swing and you miss.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.262
Gotta keep on swinging.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.786
I hit on ten women a day.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.004
I'm goingto have
sexual intercourse

26:55.091 --> 26:56.092
with at least one of them.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.311
That is gross.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.271
She's intrigued by me,
this one.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.012
She's just too proud
to admit it.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.101
Yeah, get your shoes on, Romeo.

27:09.802 --> 27:10.977
Hey.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.240
Focus on the shoes.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.242
You know,
I didn't notice before.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.983
You're not bad-lookin'.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.071
Shoulders
are a bit too wide

27:18.158 --> 27:21.030
but, uh,
otherwise, pretty nice.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.338
You're kidding, right?
You're trying to hit on me?

27:24.425 --> 27:26.296
What man in his right mind
wouldn't want to hit on you?

27:26.383 --> 27:27.994
Okay, leave her alone.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.778
Get in the car.

27:32.781 --> 27:36.524
[Teresa]
'I'm sorry. My colleague, Agent
Jane, refuses to apologize.'

27:36.611 --> 27:39.309
And he says he's happy
to see you in court.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.920
And you refuse
to talk to us

27:41.007 --> 27:43.705
'so I can't rule you out
as a suspect.'

27:43.792 --> 27:46.055
I'm afraid this is gonna
make a bit of a mess.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.622
- Keith, I suggest--
- No, no.

27:47.709 --> 27:51.582
I have nothing to hide.
What do you wanna know?

27:51.670 --> 27:55.282
What do you know about your
wife's affair with Paul Fricke?

27:55.369 --> 27:56.936
I knew Claire
was having an affair

27:57.023 --> 27:59.460
with this Fricke person,
and I knew about the money

27:59.547 --> 28:00.679
she was gonna give him.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.463
Then why did you deny it?

28:02.550 --> 28:04.770
It's not the sort of thing
one likes to admit, now, is it?

28:07.511 --> 28:08.730
And I knew it would
make me a suspect

28:08.817 --> 28:10.819
and that would be tedious.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.778
Did you confront her
about Fricke?

28:12.865 --> 28:16.129
No. I stopped the check
immediately, of course.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.740
And that was the end of it?
You weren't angry?

28:18.827 --> 28:20.350
Not at all.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.918
I was happy. I wanted
to divorce her for ages.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.485
Why?

28:24.572 --> 28:28.097
She'd become irritating.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.708
The cost of divorce
always deterred me

28:29.795 --> 28:31.231
but her infidelity
with Fricke

28:31.318 --> 28:33.755
cut the payout
she'd receive in half.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.888
Now if Claire had lived,
come Monday

28:35.975 --> 28:38.499
she'd be in
for a nasty surprise.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.588
I was all set to serve her
with divorce papers.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.069
Even cuckolded,
she stood to get a big sum.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.462
Rich man like yourself..

28:45.549 --> 28:47.638
...her death saved you
a lot of money, didn't it?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.902
Yes, it did.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.208
But money isn't everything,
is it?

28:54.950 --> 28:58.432
I'm sorry she's dead...
truly sorry.

29:00.129 --> 29:04.046
But every cloud, as they say.

29:04.133 --> 29:07.223
Well, I believe
we're done here.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.138
Seems so.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.010
You'll be hearing from
the attorney general shortly

29:11.097 --> 29:12.751
regarding Mr. Jane's conduct.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.318
Oh, I doubt it.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.712
Really?

29:17.799 --> 29:19.758
When you've thought about it
you'll see that this business

29:19.845 --> 29:21.890
makes you seem small and silly

29:21.977 --> 29:23.805
and you'll drop
the whole matter.

29:33.206 --> 29:36.426
You misled us, Paul. You were
going to take money from Claire.

29:36.513 --> 29:39.690
But I didn't, did I?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.040
A business associate of mine

29:41.127 --> 29:43.085
is opening up
a new club here in town.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.784
He, uh, offered me a role
as partial owner

29:45.871 --> 29:48.612
if I could come up with
a share of the building costs.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.614
Claire was generous enough
to offer me a loan.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.138
And?

29:52.225 --> 29:54.662
I went to deposit it
just a couple days ago

29:54.749 --> 29:56.577
and was told that the check
had been stopped.

29:56.664 --> 29:57.578
That must have been
disappointing.

29:57.665 --> 29:58.709
What did Claire say?

29:58.797 --> 29:59.972
She said it must be a mistake

30:00.059 --> 30:01.538
and she'd
take care of it Monday.

30:01.625 --> 30:05.194
- Did you believe her?
- Doesn't really matter.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.761
You know what the best part
about being me is?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.719
No, I don't.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.071
There are literally dozens
of rich, needy women out there

30:12.158 --> 30:15.291
that, uh, I could go to
for financial help.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
I didn't need Claire's money.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.338
[door opens]

30:18.425 --> 30:22.385
Hey. Uh, what's the story
with Katie the waitress?

30:22.472 --> 30:24.779
I'm in the middle
of something.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.173
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just-just thinking.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.306
I had a thought.
Bear with me?

30:30.393 --> 30:31.351
So, Katie, tell me.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.482
Nothing to tell.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.792
Used to be if I, uh, didn't
score for whatever reason

30:37.879 --> 30:40.664
I'd, uh, call her
off the bench.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.189
Can't sleep alone, huh?

30:43.276 --> 30:46.366
Some people use cocoa
and a good book.

30:46.453 --> 30:47.758
I use beautiful women.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.586
[chuckles]

30:49.673 --> 30:51.850
She must have been
crazy about you to..

30:51.937 --> 30:54.200
...put up with
a deal like that, huh?

30:54.287 --> 30:55.679
I guess so.

30:55.766 --> 30:58.465
Difficult for her now
to watch you pick up

30:58.552 --> 31:01.120
a different beautiful woman
every night.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.904
That's not how it is
with me and Katie.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.081
Well, sure, it is. She loves
you. That much is clear.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.562
Maybe that's what
this is all about.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.825
Your behavior
got too much for her.

31:10.912 --> 31:14.611
Katie has absolutely nothing
to do with this.

31:14.698 --> 31:15.961
How can you be so sure?

31:16.048 --> 31:19.965
I know Katie.
She's a good person.

31:20.052 --> 31:23.185
She would never
hurt anyone.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.884
Okay, great.
Thanks. You can go.

31:25.971 --> 31:29.365
- No.
- Ah, sorry. I'm sorry.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.411
When Agent Cho
says you can go, you can go.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.847
Not a moment sooner.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.635
Just give me one second.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.726
Hey, you can't dismiss
my subjects like that.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.425
Oh, I know,
and I-I took it back.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.818
Besides, we need him back
out there in the saddle.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.170
You will agree with me 100%
when I explain my theory.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.781
My little plan.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.131
Do you have
any good clothes?

31:56.218 --> 31:57.567
I'm wearing them.

31:57.654 --> 32:01.441
Uh, do you have anything
with a little more, uh..

32:01.528 --> 32:03.008
...zing?

32:03.095 --> 32:04.444
No.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.620
Okay.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.622
Well..

32:08.709 --> 32:10.406
I'm gonna have to
take you shopping..

32:10.493 --> 32:13.148
...just you and me.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.671
I'll wait for you.

32:14.758 --> 32:15.977
Right here.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.548
[club music]

32:41.698 --> 32:43.396
[music continues]

32:51.621 --> 32:53.449
I'm in position.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.408
[Patrick]
'Okay, look around
for a likely target.'

32:55.495 --> 32:57.062
Will do. Hey.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.107
Bourbon on the rocks.
Make it a double.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.938
[indistinct chattering]

33:06.941 --> 33:09.422
- Those two will do, I guess.
- 'Good.'

33:09.509 --> 33:11.206
'Okay, now listen up.'

33:11.293 --> 33:13.513
Relax. I'm gonna talk you
right through this.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.604
Keep it smooth. You have
to be calm and confident.

33:17.691 --> 33:21.695
Yeah, you told me that already.
I have the general idea.

33:21.782 --> 33:25.829
Hello, ladies,
I'll be right with you.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.963
Start a tab for me, would you?
Room 206. That's for you.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.879
Hi. My name's Kimball.
What're your names? You first.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.489
- Darby.
- Darby.

33:33.576 --> 33:34.925
- Sara-Beth.
- Hey, Sara-Beth.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.493
Tell me about yourselves.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.192
- Um..
- What do you wanna know?

33:40.279 --> 33:42.498
Well, it's not exactly textbook,
but he's figuring it out.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.674
That worked? "Hello, ladies"?

33:44.761 --> 33:47.155
- He's kicking it old-school.
- There's Fricke.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.852
Where?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.158
[Wayne]
'Let me see.'

33:50.245 --> 33:53.509
Cho, look,
with the two blondes.

33:53.596 --> 33:54.902
[indistinct chattering]

34:03.476 --> 34:05.347
I don't believe this guy.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.741
I give up.
I do not understand women.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.221
Never have, never will.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.396
Seems like the dumber
you treat them

34:10.483 --> 34:12.137
the better they like it.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.616
They're drunkwomen.

34:13.703 --> 34:16.054
You can't generalize
all women in general.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.577
This is your fault.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.100
No, it's not.
I'm just sitting here.

34:22.756 --> 34:25.454
Katie, you've worked
a double today.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.630
Why don't you clock out
and have a drink on the house?

34:27.717 --> 34:30.068
Thanks, Mr. Haightly.
That'd be good.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.286
Sure.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.250
Here we go.

34:38.337 --> 34:39.425
This is where we bring it.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.297
Time for phase two.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.125
Roger that.
Phase two coming up.

34:44.212 --> 34:47.694
What's phase two?

34:47.781 --> 34:49.217
[whispering indistinctly]

34:53.178 --> 34:54.483
Let's go, Sara-Beth.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.050
What did he say?

35:07.409 --> 35:09.498
[chuckles]

35:09.585 --> 35:10.978
What did he say?
I didn't hear.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.458
Uh, he said, uh..

35:14.547 --> 35:17.854
Uh...y-you don't wanna know.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.379
[laughing]

35:23.121 --> 35:24.470
[Cho]
'Oh, well.'

35:24.557 --> 35:27.864
- Struck out, huh?
- I blew it, as usual.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.780
I'm just unlucky in love.
Always have been.

35:30.867 --> 35:33.174
I know how that goes.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.350
Same story, huh?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.178
Same story.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.880
- That guy?
- Him.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.752
You know, no offense,
but I've been watching him

35:45.839 --> 35:47.493
operate this evening, and he
seems like kind of a creep.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.365
A player, no doubt,
but a creep.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.802
This isn't who he is.

35:52.889 --> 35:57.111
When we were together, he was
a sweet, caring, generous man.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.374
It was me
that screwed it up.

35:59.461 --> 36:00.810
And we had
this terrible fight

36:00.897 --> 36:03.509
and I said some mean things.

36:03.596 --> 36:06.425
Meanthings.

36:06.512 --> 36:09.515
All this is an attempt
to prove me wrong, I guess.

36:09.602 --> 36:10.864
If I had a woman
like you in love with me

36:10.951 --> 36:12.648
you could say whatever you like.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.129
I wouldn't be running around.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.827
That's nice of you
to say. Thank you.

36:17.914 --> 36:20.047
You know what you need to do?

36:20.134 --> 36:21.135
You need to make him jealous.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.484
Let him see you out and about

36:22.571 --> 36:24.617
enjoying yourself
with another man.

36:24.704 --> 36:28.142
Are you hitting on me?

36:28.229 --> 36:30.144
Yes, I am.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.972
It's a good plan, isn't it?

36:32.059 --> 36:34.540
The kid's a natural.
Look at him. Look at him go.

36:34.627 --> 36:38.848
The Cho.
No business like Chobusiness.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.067
[Cho]
206.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.549
Here's the plan.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.377
Let's walk right past him
laughing and smiling

36:45.464 --> 36:47.030
like we're on
our way somewhere cool.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.075
Get him thinking.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.295
And then what?

36:50.382 --> 36:51.731
We'll think of something.

36:51.818 --> 36:52.906
[chuckles]

36:55.822 --> 36:58.694
Alright. Let's do it.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.043
After you.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.440
[laughing]

37:20.325 --> 37:21.761
[laughs]

37:21.848 --> 37:22.762
[speaks indistinctly]

37:30.378 --> 37:32.467
Okay, we're in the room.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.426
[Patrick]
'Hey, Cho,
that's some nice work.'

37:34.513 --> 37:36.558
Very nice work.
So just sit tight.

37:36.645 --> 37:37.777
'I don't think
it's gonna take long.'

37:37.864 --> 37:38.865
You hope.

37:38.952 --> 37:39.953
Who are you talking to?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.783
My colleagues.

37:43.870 --> 37:47.221
Okay...who are they?

37:47.308 --> 37:49.092
I'm a state agent, ma'am.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.659
We're conducting
an undercover operation

37:50.746 --> 37:52.922
regarding
the Wolcott murder case.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.881
I-I don't understand.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.143
I apologize
for the deception.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.928
You mean, you're not...
you don't..

37:59.015 --> 38:01.017
No, ma'am.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.193
[chuckles]
Oh.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.847
I'm so embarrassed.

38:04.934 --> 38:07.197
That's understandable.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.851
[sobbing]

38:11.593 --> 38:12.551
I..

38:15.075 --> 38:17.643
Nothing is happening.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.210
You have to have
patience, woman.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.343
[Wayne]
'She just doesn't have
any patience.'

38:22.430 --> 38:24.519
I'm not touching that one.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.611
There.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.318
Ah!

38:44.104 --> 38:45.323
Come on.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.591
[doorknob rattling]

38:55.985 --> 38:58.205
- Drop the weapon.
- Drop it, Haightly.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.341
See your hands
behind your back. Let's go.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.041
[grunts]

39:13.960 --> 39:15.309
Hi.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.140
[Haightly]
'You set me up.'

39:20.227 --> 39:21.402
[Lisbon]
'Yes, we did.'

39:21.489 --> 39:23.230
How did you know
it was me?

39:23.317 --> 39:25.058
Ha!

39:25.145 --> 39:27.843
It was a cold night.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.106
Fricke told us that
the patio door in his room

39:30.193 --> 39:32.065
was closed
when he went to sleep

39:32.152 --> 39:35.111
and I checked, you can't
open them from the outside

39:35.198 --> 39:36.939
which means that the killer
must have entered

39:37.026 --> 39:40.900
by the main door,
which requires a key.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.511
Who has the keys? Staff.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.861
Who on the staff would
wanna hurt Claire Wolcott?

39:45.948 --> 39:48.124
I don't know. Nobody.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.648
Who would wanna hurt
Paul Fricke?

39:49.735 --> 39:50.736
[gunshots]

39:53.652 --> 39:55.436
'Maybe you.'

39:55.523 --> 39:58.396
But what reason would you have
for hating Paul Fricke?

39:58.483 --> 40:02.138
Let me guess. Uh...
something to do with a woman?

40:02.225 --> 40:03.488
Katie?

40:05.533 --> 40:09.058
You hated him because
he used and abused her..

40:09.145 --> 40:10.973
...the woman youloved.

40:11.060 --> 40:14.629
I'm not sorry. He's dirt.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.762
'The way he carried on
with those other women..'

40:16.849 --> 40:18.372
'...rubbing Katie's nose in it.'

40:18.459 --> 40:21.375
I never would hurt her
like he did.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.510
I wish I had killed him.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.512
But you killed
Claire Wolcott instead.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.296
I never meant to do that.

40:29.383 --> 40:32.081
I wanted to kill
Fricke, not Claire.

40:32.168 --> 40:33.692
But she shouldn't have been
doing what she was doing

40:33.779 --> 40:37.652
should she? I mean,
it's not like anybody cares.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.306
- Her husband was going--
- I care.

40:39.393 --> 40:43.005
I care about Claire Wolcott!

40:43.092 --> 40:44.790
- She was a living person.
- That's enough.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.792
No. You took her life.

40:46.879 --> 40:50.230
I-I just...
I think he should be sorry.

40:53.842 --> 40:54.800
You're right.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.108
Well, do you wanna say it?

41:03.678 --> 41:04.723
I'm sorry.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.552
Thank you.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.603
- Where's Cho?
- I don't know.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.823
Called him a couple times.
No answer.

41:17.910 --> 41:20.434
[Katie]
'The problem is,
I really love Paul.'

41:20.521 --> 41:22.871
I know how he seems,
and I know how he's been

41:22.958 --> 41:26.222
but...at
the end of the day

41:26.309 --> 41:29.095
when I think of who
I really wanna be with..

41:29.182 --> 41:31.837
...it's him.

41:31.924 --> 41:32.925
That's crazy, huh?

41:36.058 --> 41:38.539
Love is crazy,
I guess.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.932
No, it isn't.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.107
You should seek
psychiatric help.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.412
[laughs]

41:46.547 --> 41:47.505
Ugh.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.300
You mind?

42:00.387 --> 42:01.562
Not at all.

42:04.391 --> 42:05.653
[sighs]

42:07.176 --> 42:09.309
- Rough night?
- Ah, not bad.

42:09.396 --> 42:11.354
Couple good phone numbers.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.486
Hmm.

42:18.927 --> 42:20.146
[indistinct murmuring]

42:22.540 --> 42:26.282
Yep. Two very tasty numbers.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.898
[squirting]

42:32.985 --> 42:35.596
I wish you'd stop being
so damn stupid.

42:35.683 --> 42:37.859
You have a good woman
over there that knows you

42:37.946 --> 42:41.123
and still loves you.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.385
[instrumental music]

43:00.490 --> 43:02.971
Excuse me.

43:03.058 --> 43:05.365
- Oh.
- You looked kind of lonely.

43:05.452 --> 43:07.454
My friend and I were wondering
if you'd like to join us.

43:10.413 --> 43:14.330
Hi. Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm married.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.830
[theme music]
