Get up.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.698
-Hey. Mango.
-Damn it!

00:31.781 --> 00:34.159
You'll get nowhere in life like this.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.076
That hurts.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.911
What is this about?

00:37.704 --> 00:38.705
She's my partner.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.415
Let him go.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.211
Release him.

Watch your mouth.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.596
My partner was just saying hi.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.808
You've got guts,

01:01.144 --> 01:02.353
but no finesse.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.819
What do you want?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.447
Do you have a warrant?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.700
No. I don't have a warrant.

Gosh. You're famous
for having pea-sized balls,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.917
but you attack a cop and demand a warrant.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.920
Seeing how you act,
the drugs must be here, right?

01:28.838 --> 01:31.508
What… What drugs?

01:31.591 --> 01:34.344
You're stuttering now. How adorable.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.262
You know.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.437

02:27.105 --> 02:29.440
We don't even have Tylenol here.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.693
Didn't you hide it there last time?

02:34.487 --> 02:37.031
You hid it up there last time too.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.324
You hid it high up.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.742

03:49.520 --> 03:51.773
I told you to bring Mango out,

03:51.856 --> 03:53.399
not wipe everyone out.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.193
They wouldn't listen.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.363
It wasn't because you wanted to show me
how tough you are?

04:01.824 --> 04:04.160
Didn't you want to see what I could do?

04:06.496 --> 04:07.830
Don't do that again.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.068

04:45.618 --> 04:47.870
-Send it to Forensics.
-Yes, sir.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.908
That's an enticing offer.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.818
-You.
-Yes?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.069
Check inside again.

23:24.152 --> 23:24.986
Yes, sir.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.410
Did you see who fired the shot?

23:42.379 --> 23:45.966
Damn it. With that crack,
we can't even use it as evidence.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.012
Captain. Over here.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.647
Captain.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.767
Shit!

25:40.372 --> 25:42.082
Cha Giho was after me.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.251
They showed no signs of movement--

25:44.334 --> 25:45.585
Taeju.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.756
Who are we?

25:51.508 --> 25:55.011
Did you forget who we are because of
the designer suits and executive titles?

25:56.888 --> 25:58.098
I'm sorry.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.435
Find out who the rat is.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.187
Yes, sir.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.440
But…

26:09.526 --> 26:11.278
why didn't Jiwoo contact us?

26:26.543 --> 26:30.005
<i>We checked, and no one from our team
discharged their firearm.</i>

26:30.964 --> 26:31.798
Really?

26:35.260 --> 26:36.761
Good work today. Captain Lee.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.356
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

27:03.788 --> 27:08.209
<i>The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to…</i>

27:35.612 --> 27:39.282
INCOMING CALL

27:52.170 --> 27:54.172
CALLING…

27:54.255 --> 27:55.507
CALL ENDED

28:03.765 --> 28:05.016
Look at this.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.059
Look.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.645
You and Choi Mujin were talking.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.271
I saw you.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.774
Choi Mujin was there!

28:14.526 --> 28:16.319
I don't know anything.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.364
This fucking jerk…

28:20.240 --> 28:21.074
Get over here.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.534
Get over here.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.828
-What the hell?
-Hey! Detectives!

28:24.911 --> 28:27.497
-Pildo, let go!
-I saw you.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.165
Talk, you bastard.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.762
-Everyone take out your guns.
-What?

28:43.847 --> 28:44.764
What…

28:52.439 --> 28:54.941
Captain. Even us?

28:56.568 --> 28:57.569
Captain.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.326
Sir. It wasn't us.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.142
Return your firearms.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.938
What the hell is going on?

29:35.607 --> 29:36.858
Shit.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.240
Shit.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.409
Was going after
Park Changoo and Mango a fake?

29:49.078 --> 29:51.790
We went after small fry and
waited for Choi Mujin to drop his guard.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.167
So he was the target from the get-go.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.085
Because we had to catch him in the act!

30:06.054 --> 30:06.930
Choi Mujin.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.808
He became the boss
of Dongcheon 11 years ago.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.936
Drug production and distribution,
assault, and even murder.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.231
He was the main suspect
in numerous cases but was never indicted.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.193
We never had enough evidence
and others always took the fall.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.700
YOON DONGHOON
DIED IN 2016

30:31.871 --> 30:32.789
Yoon Donghoon.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.543
He was Choi Mujin's closest friend.
He was murdered five years ago.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.631
Who killed him?

30:41.714 --> 30:42.757
We never caught him.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.968
We never found the murder weapon.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.428
-But--
-What happened?

30:54.143 --> 30:56.980
You didn't bring a shred of evidence
and burned down the ship?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.065
Cha Giho.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.984
What do you think you're doing?

31:02.026 --> 31:02.944
I'm sorry, sir.

31:03.486 --> 31:06.155
I told you not to act on your emotions.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.157
What will you do about this?

31:09.450 --> 31:11.119
We have to catch Choi Mujin.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.789
We have to bring him down!

31:22.130 --> 31:23.798
All of you, keep your mouths shut.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.552
If this gets out, we're all dead.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.810
Shape up.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.843
Can we catch that asshole Choi Mujin?

32:11.012 --> 32:13.348
Who the heck fired that gun?

32:16.851 --> 32:18.561
How long have you been after him?

32:19.187 --> 32:22.273
Since before I joined Narcotics,
so over four years.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.401
Why is Captain after him?

32:25.485 --> 32:26.361
Why else?

32:26.986 --> 32:29.155
Because he's the biggest drug ring,
of course.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.077
Do you know how many drugs
Dongcheon distributes yearly?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.454
Captain has his own reasons.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.127
A rookie from Narcotics died a while back.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.713
I think it was around the year 2004…

33:07.777 --> 33:09.404
So from then until now…

33:09.487 --> 33:10.321
Yes.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.073
Imagine how Captain…

33:13.074 --> 33:15.243
How Giho must feel right now.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.415
What do we do now?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.083
What else?

33:23.251 --> 33:24.544
We prepare and attack again.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.297
Until we take down the Dongcheon assholes.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.259
Here.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.137
How are you so chill?

33:36.556 --> 33:38.307
Junho. Over here.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.393
Junho.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.602
What? Junho's here?

33:41.686 --> 33:43.479
-Yes. Hello.
-I need to make a call.

33:43.563 --> 33:44.731
Sure.

33:44.814 --> 33:45.732
Sit down.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.984
-Hey, kid. You okay?
-Yes, I am.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.902
-I'm glad you came.
-Thanks.

33:49.986 --> 33:50.987
Another glass, please!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.281
That looks good.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.699
Hey, eat up.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.288
Are you okay?

34:04.667 --> 34:06.836
<i>It was an ambush,
so I didn't know in advance.</i>

34:08.212 --> 34:09.380
Is there a tail on me?

34:10.173 --> 34:11.049
No.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.095
<i>There are cameras in the hotel.</i>

34:16.179 --> 34:18.056
<i>The hallway at the penthouse entrance.</i>

34:18.139 --> 34:20.558
<i>The basement elevator entrance.
The garage exit.</i>

34:20.641 --> 34:22.810
<i>There are three cameras in those places.</i>

34:26.481 --> 34:28.900
Which means we have a mole.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.319
I'll look into it.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.573
<i>Did you shoot the gun?</i>

34:37.450 --> 34:39.243
<i>I had no way of contacting you.</i>

34:41.496 --> 34:42.705
And I always…

34:46.042 --> 34:48.419
planned to use the gun at a crime scene.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.423
<i>The truth will come out now…</i>

34:55.885 --> 34:57.470
<i>since I left the gun there.</i>

35:34.423 --> 35:35.550
You know Junho, right?

35:35.633 --> 35:37.677
You sent him on vacation.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.347
We'll all work together
once you return. Right?

35:42.098 --> 35:43.432
Let's drink.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.475
Punks.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.769
-Cheers.
-Gosh.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.132
What?

36:19.677 --> 36:20.511
Sir.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.512
What?

36:22.638 --> 36:23.556
What?

36:24.432 --> 36:25.349
Hey.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.018
What going on?

36:30.771 --> 36:33.232
-Why?
-Damn it.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.074
We've been spotted.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.873
Hey!

38:14.333 --> 38:15.543
You ready?

38:16.502 --> 38:19.505
Fuck, I've been ready for five years!

38:50.828 --> 38:55.082
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

39:34.246 --> 39:35.915
-What?
-Get out of the way!

39:46.842 --> 39:48.594
This place hasn't changed at all.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.473
Mr. Jung!

39:53.641 --> 39:54.600
It's me!

39:56.644 --> 39:57.728
Kill them all.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.696
You son of a bitch!

40:11.659 --> 40:13.369
You son of a bitch.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.633
Shit!

41:18.434 --> 41:22.354
It's been so long, Taeju. I should say hi.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.149
You asshole.

41:25.941 --> 41:26.901
Do you really think--

41:26.984 --> 41:28.903
Hey! You're hurting my feelings.

41:31.238 --> 41:32.948
Come on.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.494
Aren't you glad to see me?

41:40.581 --> 41:41.749
Stop it!

41:44.960 --> 41:46.754
You motherfucker!

41:46.837 --> 41:48.255
Damn it.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.762
"Kill me if you want."

41:56.805 --> 41:58.641
That's the look on your face.

42:00.476 --> 42:01.894
I won't kill you.

42:03.062 --> 42:03.938
Relax.

42:10.736 --> 42:11.695
Face.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.989
Arm.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.450
Leg.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.037
Choose one. Just one.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.083
You can't choose, can you?

42:27.962 --> 42:29.088
I couldn't either.

42:42.059 --> 42:45.062
THE POWER OF SCIENCE REVEALS THE TRUTH

42:51.527 --> 42:52.444
Damn it.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.613
Hey. Call me.

43:14.675 --> 43:15.634
<i>Where are you?</i>

43:16.427 --> 43:17.344
I'm home.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.762
<i>Come to the Dongcheon gym.</i>

44:16.445 --> 44:18.530
Stand up straight.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.991
How could you not see who attacked you?
Are you kidding me?

44:21.075 --> 44:22.201
Go on in.

44:24.036 --> 44:24.995
Jung Taeju.

44:26.163 --> 44:27.498
You really won't talk?

44:28.207 --> 44:29.041
Well?

44:45.557 --> 44:47.559
I'M BACK

44:47.643 --> 44:49.103
I don't know who it was,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.814
but someone wrecked
Dongcheon's muscle team.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.983
Three died
and one is in critical condition.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.238
Was Choi Mujin killed?

46:02.593 --> 46:07.598
