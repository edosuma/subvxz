Did he pee on the floor?
He bite you?

05:00.387 --> 05:01.562
What'd he do?Thanks, Doc.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.780
Remember what I said.
I will.

05:02.824 --> 05:03.955
Copy that. All right.Hey.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.044

what did he say?

in an alley
off of Maunakea this morning.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.711
She was found by a local vendor
who recognized her.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.714
Mei was a prominent figure
in the Chinatown community.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.282
She'd been an acupuncturist
there for over 25 years.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.762
She actually had
a shop close by

05:27.805 --> 05:29.241
to where her
body was found.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.113
Phone and wallet were missing.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.071

a robbery gone bad?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.377
Doubtful.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.857
Why?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.249
'Cause according to HPD, her
daughter, Cammy, is missing.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.425
She worked with her mother,

05:38.468 --> 05:39.817
didn't show up
at the shop this morning.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.732
They went to her house.
She wasn't there.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.995
And all their calls were
going to voice mail.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.997
I'm sorry, the...
the daughter goes missing

05:46.041 --> 05:47.999
the exact same time
the mother dies?

05:48.043 --> 05:49.218
DANNY: Maybe she
could be hiding.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.089
I mean, you know,
people don't disappear.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.440
Unless somebody
makes them disappear.DANNY: Right.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.884
STEVE:
How long did Mei work for you?

06:02.927 --> 06:05.800
I've known Mei
for nearly 30 years.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.410
But she doesn't work for me,
exactly.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.239
She rented space in my
shop for her business.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.981
Just a bed and, uh,
the address, really.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.417
Most of her work

06:14.461 --> 06:15.897
was done in
client homes.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.420
She was doing house calls.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
Yes.

06:18.769 --> 06:21.555
And her daughter, Cammy,
she worked with her?

06:21.598 --> 06:23.078
Cammy was her pupil,

06:23.121 --> 06:24.775
learning acupuncture
from her mother.

06:24.819 --> 06:28.170
Okay, uh, do you know
if they were working last night?

06:28.213 --> 06:29.345
No.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.825
But she keeps
an appointment book.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.522
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.358
Oh, good. This is, uh...

06:42.402 --> 06:45.100
Well, this might as well be
in Chinese.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.231
Give it to me.

Where does the...

06:51.149 --> 06:52.847
date change?

06:52.890 --> 06:54.326
There it is. Friday.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.112
Last appointment was at 9:00

06:57.155 --> 07:00.768
at the house of a man
named Tom Boyle.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.379
Excuse me.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.817
Tommy Boyle.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.428
That's a wise guy
from Boston,

07:08.471 --> 07:09.951
moved out here
a couple years ago.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.387
He's a big

07:11.431 --> 07:13.998
Danny, if it's the same
Tommy Boyle, we got trouble.

07:14.042 --> 07:14.999
Why?

07:15.043 --> 07:16.784
Danny, you get the exact same

07:16.827 --> 07:20.135
HPD daily briefs each morning
that I do, do you not?

07:20.178 --> 07:21.615
I do, uh, but I also feed,

07:21.658 --> 07:23.312
uh, two children
and take them to school.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.748
Plus, I don't like to read,
which...

07:24.792 --> 07:26.750
Tommy Boyle, he killed
himself last night.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.013
The alert said he
swallowed a bullet.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.667
So you got a doctor
and a patient,

07:30.711 --> 07:32.364
they both die the same night,

07:32.408 --> 07:34.758
and, uh, doctor's apprentice,
she goes missing.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.194
This is not a coincidence.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.370
No.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.024
NOELANI:
I'm sorry, Commander,

07:40.068 --> 07:41.548
but Mei Lin's GSW
was a through-and-through,

07:41.591 --> 07:42.940
and there was no
ballistic evidence

07:42.984 --> 07:44.289
found at the scene.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.857
All right. We got an
estimated time of death?

07:46.901 --> 07:48.206
Based on liver temp,

07:48.250 --> 07:50.687
I'd say between 9:00
and 11:00 p.m. last night.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.168
9:00 and 11:00.
So that's after her appointment.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.865
What about the client,
Tommy Boyle?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.476
Well, I would put
Mr. Boyle's T.O.D.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.434
in the same time frame
as Mrs. Lin.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.523
HPD reported a possible suicide.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.220
My preliminary exam revealed

08:02.264 --> 08:04.135
cordite residue
on Mr. Boyle's trigger finger,

08:04.179 --> 08:05.789
which would support
this hypothesis.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.140
I may have found motive
in his medical records.

08:09.184 --> 08:12.317
Mr. Boyle was battling a
very aggressive adenocarcinoma.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.059
Statistically, he should have
died like six months ago.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.408
All right.
One of the many things

08:16.452 --> 08:17.801
acupuncture is used for
is pain relief.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.803
That's what I'm thinking
he was doing it for.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.153
And what, you think
he was tired of waiting around?

08:22.197 --> 08:23.372
It looks that way, yes,

08:23.415 --> 08:24.852
but because of the manner
of his death,

08:24.895 --> 08:26.201
I'm required to do
a full autopsy.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.376
STEVE:
Noelani, do me a favor.

08:27.419 --> 08:30.205
Please go into this
with an open mind.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.859
You thinking foul play?

08:31.902 --> 08:33.164
How about you tell us?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.036
Understood, Commander.All right.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.560
Okay, so what do you think?I don't know.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.214
I guess I just don't
see Tommy Boyle

08:39.257 --> 08:40.389
as the suicidal type.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.173
I mean, the fact
that the guy was

08:42.217 --> 08:43.305
pursuing alternative therapies

08:43.348 --> 08:45.002
tells me he wanted
to live, not die.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.222
No, so maybe
this was a hit,

08:47.265 --> 08:49.572
disguised to look like, uh,
he killed himself.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.356
Maybe it was some kind
of payback,

08:51.400 --> 08:52.706
retribution for something.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.838
So, if that's the case,

08:54.882 --> 08:57.014
then Mei and Cammy
probably witnessed,

08:57.058 --> 08:58.059
uh, the murder.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.582
The shooter then got Mei.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.279
Obviously wants
Cammy, as well.

09:01.323 --> 09:04.195
Now she's gone, they're gonna
be looking for her. Right?

09:04.239 --> 09:05.414
Right.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.465
Hey, listen to me.
Huh?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.424
Let's, uh...

09:15.467 --> 09:17.208
let's you and I
both be realistic

09:17.252 --> 09:18.819
about our expectations
going in there,

09:18.862 --> 09:21.082
what we're gonna get out of
talking to Tommy Boyle's kid.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.910
I don't know what that means.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.564
Have you ever heard
the expression,

09:24.607 --> 09:27.828
"As welcome as a cop at
an Irish mobster's wake"?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.438
No. That's not
an expression.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.092
You just made that up.I did just make it up.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.920
You made it up.I made it up to
make a point.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.183
Okay? This is not gonna be
a hospitable environment.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.358
That's all.Thank you. Thank you.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.620
Sure.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.240
Whoa. Can I help you?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.373
Uh, yes, yes, you can.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.984
I'm here to see, uh,
Conor Boyle, actually.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
I'm sorry. That's not possible.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.640
It's not possible? Okay.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.815
You see I'm wearing

09:58.859 --> 10:00.687
a badge, right?
You see that?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.211
I do.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.995
Okay, let's start
over again.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.128
My name's Commander
Steve McGarrett.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.999
This is my partner,
Detective Danny Williams.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.610
It's currently an active
investigation happening.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.960
We need to speak to Conor.
A couple minutes of his time,

10:13.003 --> 10:14.831
then we'll be out
of here, all right?Whoa.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.008
I understand.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.444
But unless you're gonna charge

10:19.488 --> 10:21.664
my boss with something,
I suggest you disappear.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.797
See, I told you it
would be like this.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.538
Yeah, you really did,
didn't you?

10:26.582 --> 10:27.670
Yeah.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.544
DANNY:
Did it help relieve any stress?

10:32.588 --> 10:33.981
I actually feel
quite relaxed now.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.504
Thanks for asking.
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.637
No hard feelings, huh?

10:39.726 --> 10:41.162
Conor Boyle.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.686
It's-it's okay.
Just...

10:43.730 --> 10:45.253
take a walk. It's okay.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.994
It's okay.

10:47.037 --> 10:48.691
My name's Commander
Steve McGarrett.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.692
This is Detective
Danny Williams.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.693
We need to talk.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.825
You're right. We do.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.304
I'm supposed to be
laying my father

10:53.348 --> 10:54.741
to rest today,
and now I'm told

10:54.784 --> 10:56.046
you're holding his body
for an autopsy.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.482
Sorry about that.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.180
It's protocol.
You know what
else is protocol?

10:59.223 --> 11:01.748
Giving a dead man some dignity.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.663
My father deserves
a decent burial.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.273
These people have come here

11:05.316 --> 11:07.275
to pay their respects.Okay, listen.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.755
We... we know
what your father did

11:08.798 --> 11:11.540
back in Boston, okay,
so just do us a favor, okay?

11:11.583 --> 11:12.672
Couple minutes.

11:12.715 --> 11:13.890
Conor, the sooner you

11:13.934 --> 11:16.240
answer our questions,
the sooner we're gone.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.895
Please.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.814
Your father, he was
a very lucky man.

11:24.858 --> 11:28.383
He spent the last 18 months
dying very slowly and painfully,

11:28.426 --> 11:29.776
so how do you figure?

11:29.819 --> 11:32.343
I-I just mean that most
of his associates

11:32.387 --> 11:34.694
are either, uh, doing time
on the mainland

11:34.737 --> 11:36.696
or they're buried over
on a beach somewhere.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.220
You know, this guy is lucky,
he gets to retire

11:39.263 --> 11:41.396
over here in what
some people call paradise.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.399
Still, I wouldn't call being
diagnosed with lung cancer

11:44.442 --> 11:47.054
the week after he moves out here
luck, but hey,

11:47.097 --> 11:49.317
maybe that's
just me, you know?Fair enough.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.319
Was there something you wanted
to ask me, Detectives?

11:51.362 --> 11:53.321
Because I'd like to get back

11:53.364 --> 11:54.714
to mourning my father.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.585
Yeah. How'd you, uh...
how'd you find out

11:56.628 --> 11:58.369
about your father's death?

11:58.413 --> 12:01.416
I got a call from his maid
around 7:30 this morning.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.418
She said she found him
in the living room.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.246
Gun was still in his hand.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.813
I told her not
to touch anything.

12:06.856 --> 12:07.901
I called 911

12:07.944 --> 12:09.641
and went straight over
to the house.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.775
Uh, and the gun-- had you...
had you seen that gun before?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.603
The Beretta 92.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.779
Yeah, that was his gun.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.259
Wasn't registered to him.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.913
Wish I could tell you
to go ahead

12:19.956 --> 12:22.437
and charge him with that.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.786
This woman--
her name is Mei Lin.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.179
She was your dad's
acupuncturist,

12:25.222 --> 12:27.094
and she turned up dead
last night

12:27.137 --> 12:28.312
after their appointment.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.010
She also has a daughter.
Her name is Cammy.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.489
But no one can find her.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.969
She's not answering her phone.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.275
No one's seen her.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.103
And we feel, if we find Cammy,

12:36.146 --> 12:37.800
she can really shed
some light on

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
exactly what
happened that night.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.283
Look, your father
had a lot of enemies, right?

12:42.326 --> 12:43.545
Lot of people didn't like him.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.286
Lot of people wanted
to do him dirty.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.288
I'm sorry.
You think someone killed him

12:47.331 --> 12:50.117
and made it look like a suicide?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.684
Until we have conclusive
evidence that it was suicide,

12:52.728 --> 12:54.861
we have to keep
an open mind about

12:54.904 --> 12:56.645
your father's
death, okay?

12:56.688 --> 12:58.821
I spent my life living
in the shadow

12:58.865 --> 13:01.911
of my father's decisions,
good and bad.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.521
I don't expect that
to change

13:03.565 --> 13:04.871
now that he's dead.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.579
Whoa, whoa.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.625
What? What is
that reaction?

13:20.669 --> 13:22.018
I literally...
literally was just thinking

13:22.062 --> 13:23.715
walking up these steps,
"That door's gonna be open."

13:23.759 --> 13:25.979
And I didn't say anything 'cause
I-I didn't want to bet you,

13:26.022 --> 13:27.197
'cause I knew
you wouldn't pay.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.546
I wouldn't pay?
You knew I wouldn't pay?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.331
I would have taken that bet.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.034
Cammy?

13:38.078 --> 13:39.862
Hey!

13:39.906 --> 13:42.560
Hands. Show me your hands
right now!

13:42.604 --> 13:44.084
Hands.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.739
Junior.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.568
What are you doing here?

13:50.612 --> 13:53.136
I'm looking for Cammy,
and so is he.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.675
Yo, did he just
get in that car?

14:10.719 --> 14:11.981
I knew this was gonna happen.What?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.113
You're rubbing off
on Junior.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.160
STEVE: Hey. Yo.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.901
Hey. You all right?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.555
Yeah. I kindly asked
this guy to step

14:20.598 --> 14:22.165
out of the vehicle,
and he didn't listen,

14:22.209 --> 14:23.688
so it's his fault.Would you please

14:23.732 --> 14:25.734
tell me what the hell
is going on here, Junior?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.170
My friend's in trouble.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.737
Your friend Cammy Lin?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.652
Yeah. And this guy knows why.

14:35.962 --> 14:39.400
Junior, it's Cammy.
You're the only one I can trust.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.358
Please, I need your help.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.013
Oh, God, my phone
is about to die. Ewa...

14:44.057 --> 14:45.841
JUNIOR:
That's it.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.669
When I got the message,
I tried calling her,

14:47.712 --> 14:49.062
and it went straight
to voice mail,

14:49.105 --> 14:50.933
so I went over to her place.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
How do you know
this girl, Cammy?

14:53.022 --> 14:56.069
Uh, we went to school together,
and when I got shipped out,

14:56.112 --> 14:59.420
she checked in with my mom
once a week and, you know...

14:59.463 --> 15:01.248
TANI: So I just spoke
to the crime lab.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.685
The strontium level on the round
that killed Tommy Boyle

15:03.728 --> 15:05.992
matched the GSR on Mei Lin.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.950
Wait a minute. They were killed
by the same gun?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.170
Yeah, it seems like that.DANNY: That makes sense.
I mean, we were thinking

15:10.213 --> 15:12.912
that they saw something,
they got scared, and they ran.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.958
Yeah, but if what they saw
was Boyle being murdered

15:16.002 --> 15:19.179
in what's supposed
to be a staged suicide,

15:19.222 --> 15:21.921
why the hell would the killer
use the same gun to kill Mei?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.400
Soon as the ballistics
and forensics

15:23.444 --> 15:24.967
come back,
the whole thing is blown.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.404
Maybe our guest can
help us understand.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.581
STEVE:
George Thomas.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.889
Muscle for hire,
low-level felon,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.543
multiple arrests.

15:35.586 --> 15:36.979
Tell me something, George--

15:37.023 --> 15:38.938
were you that kid
that didn't listen in school?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.593
Okay.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.117
Why don't you tell us

15:44.160 --> 15:46.467
why you were looking
for Cammy Lin?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.080
Nothing?

15:51.124 --> 15:53.953
All right, I'll start
the conversation.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.259
I think this guy is trying
to tie up a loose end.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.696
Uh-huh.Either for himself or...

15:58.740 --> 16:01.003
some other bird.
Mmm.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.571
What my colleague
is implying, George,

16:03.614 --> 16:06.182
is that either you killed
Tommy Boyle and Mei Lin,

16:06.226 --> 16:08.228
or you know who did.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.794
But, you know, if you're the guy

16:09.838 --> 16:12.058
that was just hired
to clean up the mess,

16:12.101 --> 16:14.625
George, I suggest
you start talking,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.105
because whoever
you're protecting,

16:16.149 --> 16:18.238
whatever they're paying you,
I promise you, buddy,

16:18.281 --> 16:20.718
it ain't worth a life jolt.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.459
McGarrett.

16:22.503 --> 16:23.460
I'll be right there.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.896
Well, despite how much

16:24.940 --> 16:26.811
I'm enjoying
this riveting conversation,

16:26.855 --> 16:29.031
I got something
I need to attend to.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.816
However, I'm gonna leave you
in the very capable hands

16:31.860 --> 16:33.035
of Captain Grover
and Officer Reigns.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.690
All right, George?

16:36.821 --> 16:38.780
Hey.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.434
We're gonna find
Cammy, all right?

16:40.477 --> 16:42.784
I promise.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.313
That is one vacant stare.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.923
I don't know.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.925
You sure you didn't give him
brain damage

16:53.969 --> 16:56.406
when you slammed his head
against the steering wheel?

16:56.450 --> 16:58.495
Ah, Captain Grover,
I think brain damage

16:58.539 --> 17:00.019
was a preexisting condition.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.411
Don't you think, George?

17:02.717 --> 17:04.675
I need to see a doctor.Whoa!

17:04.719 --> 17:06.416
All at once.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.939
He speaks.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.506
Yeah. He ain't wrong.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.856
Head trauma, that could be
a pretty dangerous thing

17:11.900 --> 17:13.249
if it ain't treated right.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.859
Oh, you don't have to explain

17:14.903 --> 17:17.036
the dangers of head trauma
to old George.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.342
He knows all about it,

17:19.386 --> 17:20.865
given his history.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.780
Surprised?

17:22.824 --> 17:26.088
We know you used to be
a boxer back in the day.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.743
Of course, now you're just
a pathetic, degenerate creeper

17:28.786 --> 17:31.267
that likes to look
into people's apartments.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.444
You're kind of like a...
reverse Rocky.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.230
All right, enough small talk.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.753
Who you working for?

17:39.928 --> 17:41.190
Ugh.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.974
You know something?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.064
Many years and, uh,

17:45.107 --> 17:47.457
many pounds ago,
I was a boxer myself.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.547
What

17:50.591 --> 17:52.767
Man, when I was 15,
I was 20 and oh.

17:53.768 --> 17:54.725
And then I quit.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.726
Why's that?

17:55.770 --> 17:58.599
Well, my old man always told me,

17:58.642 --> 18:00.818
"Always go out a winner."

18:00.862 --> 18:03.082
Words to live by.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.735
Hooyah.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.173
I was so good, I could take
one look at a guy,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.349
size him up, tell you
what his fighting style was.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.133
Like tough guy
Georgie here.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.266
Oh, I know
what you are.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.876
You a dancer.

18:14.919 --> 18:18.009
Like to float around the ring,
land on the ropes, cover up,

18:18.053 --> 18:20.273
let your opponent
just punch himself out

18:20.316 --> 18:21.796
while you do nothing.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.406
Well, I got some

18:23.450 --> 18:25.147
bad news for you,
partner.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.845
You can dance around
all you want to in here.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.760
You can clam up,

18:29.804 --> 18:32.198
give me that steely gaze
every time I ask you a question.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.461
You ain't wearing me down.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.898
'Cause I'll just keep on coming.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.465
I can outlast you.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.902
I can outthink you.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.644
You ain't going the distance
with me, partner.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.124
Not today.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.475
Not ever.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.741
Hey. What do we got?

18:53.784 --> 18:56.657
Okay, so this... this actually
could be a good lead. Go ahead.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.832
All right, well, I reached out

18:57.875 --> 18:59.268
to all other
law enforcement agencies

18:59.312 --> 19:00.922
to see if they had anything
current on Tommy Boyle.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.620
Turns out the Feds have
been sitting on the Boyles

19:03.664 --> 19:05.187
since they got to the island.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.407
So they didn't let him sail off
into the sunset after all.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.886
They did not.
In fact,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.453
they increased the surveillance
in the last two weeks

19:10.497 --> 19:12.760
to see if any old friends
were coming out of the woodwork,

19:12.803 --> 19:14.675
uh, you know, to pay
their respects.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.111
By the way, thought you might
like to see this.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.243
Hey, look.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.245
It's Mr. Welcome Wagon
caught on camera.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.290
That's why I told you
you gotta pay more attention.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.987
You never know
who's watching.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.033
Anyway, the Feds had
eyes on the Boyle house

19:25.076 --> 19:27.688
this morning-- they saw this guy
coming in to see the son.

19:29.472 --> 19:30.778
STEVE:
Okay, who is he?

19:30.821 --> 19:32.345
TANI:
That is Karl Ludwig.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.998
He travels on a German passport.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.783
And up until two weeks ago,

19:35.826 --> 19:39.265
he was the vice president
of the Alliance of German Banks.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.962
Okay, what happened

19:41.005 --> 19:43.094
Financial news says
nobody knows.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.662
Okay.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.796
So, what, he-he must be here
to pay his respects.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.885
Hmm.
After everyone's gone?

19:50.928 --> 19:53.017
I don't know, maybe they
were taking a meeting.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.802
DANNY: Right, but
why would this guy

19:54.845 --> 19:57.065
have a meeting on the day
that his father dies?

20:00.851 --> 20:02.723
Well, I don't get it.STEVE: What?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.290
I don't understand
what you don't get.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.205
Well, a lot of things,
but in this case,

20:06.248 --> 20:08.163
we are going to see
a Triad guy...
Mm-hmm.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.818
who's supposed to,
in theory, help us out

20:10.861 --> 20:12.080
with a strange

20:12.123 --> 20:13.995
German banker guy
and Tommy Boyle's kid.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.345
I don't... I don't see
the connection.This is Chinatown, Danny.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.738
Okay?

20:17.781 --> 20:19.479
Oh. That's good.
I don't know what that means,

20:19.522 --> 20:20.654
but thank you for that.Look.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.177
A sit-down
with this guy

20:22.221 --> 20:23.918
could really break
the case open, right?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.224
Five minutes
with this guy.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.356
Nobody drops a piece
of litter around here

20:27.400 --> 20:28.923
without Jin Leung
knowing about it.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.403
Really?
Yeah.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.710
'Cause I see trash
all over the place.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.104
He must be
a very busy guy.All right. Okay.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.260
DANNY: Who are these clowns?
What are these guys doing?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.354
That is my grandson
in the black.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.790
Ay.
Ah, ah.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.879
He's very handsome.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.492
Your partner?

21:16.536 --> 21:17.537
Yes, and he didn't mean

21:17.580 --> 21:18.929
any disrespect, Mr. Leung.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.323
No, I-I really didn't.
I apologize.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.761
You appear to be
an intelligent young man.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.936
Thanks.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.373
But when you open
your mouth,

21:27.416 --> 21:29.418
the effect disappears.

21:29.462 --> 21:30.593
Ah.

21:30.637 --> 21:34.510
Your father, I knew,
so you may stay.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.033
You may sit down.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.905
Thank you.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.907
Not you.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.127
You go to the back row

21:43.171 --> 21:45.260
and be quiet.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.914
DANNY:
Okay.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.309
I'm in time-out.

22:05.672 --> 22:09.371
I hear you are opening
a restaurant nearby.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.634
Yeah, we are.
We're working on it.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.244
Italian?

22:13.288 --> 22:14.898
Yes.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.596
In Chinatown?

22:16.639 --> 22:19.816
Well, we, uh... we want
to give people options,

22:19.860 --> 22:21.992
Mr. Leung, you see?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.560
I understand.

22:24.604 --> 22:25.996
In fact,

22:26.040 --> 22:27.737
my grandson wants to be

22:27.781 --> 22:28.825
a movie star.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.653
Is that right? Hmm.
Yes.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.613
I have poured a lot of
money into his training.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.355
Dialogue coach and...

22:36.398 --> 22:38.444
dental work.

22:38.487 --> 22:41.272
I plan to make him
the next Bruce Lee

22:41.316 --> 22:44.493
and finance a series
of movies of my own.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.496
I wish you the greatest
success with that.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.502
But why are you here?

22:53.546 --> 22:55.852
Mei Lin.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.507
I heard what happened.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.770
I thought you would.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.512
I suppose you want
to know who killed her.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.079
Yes, very much so.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.211
That I do not know.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.561
Okay, but you heard
what happened

23:08.604 --> 23:11.433
to Tommy Boyle
on the same night, right?

23:11.477 --> 23:14.305
It's not how I imagined
he would die, but, you know...

23:14.349 --> 23:15.872
I imagine there is honor

23:15.916 --> 23:18.745
in how he chose
to terminate his suffering.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.094
Okay.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.270
So you believe
that it was suicide?

23:27.754 --> 23:32.933
Mr. Leung, the son is, uh...
he's acting pretty strange.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.891
As all sons do?

23:34.935 --> 23:38.721
Yeah. Well, he took time out
from mourning his father's death

23:38.765 --> 23:40.593
to meet with this man.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.464
LEUNG:
Mr. Ludwig.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.772
Ex-German financial banker.

23:45.815 --> 23:49.340
Bloomberg reported
he retired.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.473
Okay, so a retired banker

23:51.517 --> 23:54.084
meeting with the son
of a retired mobster.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.434
Yes.

23:55.477 --> 24:00.134
Well, Tommy had retired,
but his son was not.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.962
Or, shall I say,

24:02.005 --> 24:04.573
he was trying to fill
his father's shoes.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.923
Vice has nothing
on this kid.

24:06.967 --> 24:10.579
Conor has different
aspirations.

24:10.623 --> 24:14.496
He received an MBA in
college, and to him,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.280
his father was a dinosaur.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.327
In fact, I heard that he
was working on a deal.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.677
One that would really
put him on the map.

24:21.721 --> 24:25.986
You know, to step out
of his father's shadow.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.597
Had something to do with...

24:28.641 --> 24:30.556
foreign currency.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.209
You mean the euro?

24:35.648 --> 24:38.389
Mr. Leung, any information
you can give us

24:38.433 --> 24:41.131
would be very gratefully
received, okay?

24:43.743 --> 24:46.136
I heard he was looking
for seed money.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.356
In the beginning,
he came up short.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.227
And then he found someone

24:50.271 --> 24:53.187
who was willing
to finance the whole thing.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.493
Who was that?

24:56.190 --> 24:57.626
His father.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.281
The old-fashioned
way, right?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.631
But then a strange
thing happened.

25:02.675 --> 25:07.114
Two days ago, he phoned me
and asked me for the money.

25:07.157 --> 25:09.682
Now, that is strange, right?

25:09.725 --> 25:12.336
Why would he do that
when his father

25:12.380 --> 25:14.861
was already so generous
with the money?

25:14.904 --> 25:17.341
He would do that if his old man

25:17.385 --> 25:19.561
had had second thoughts
about giving him the money.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.868
To come so close
to a prize like that

25:21.911 --> 25:26.176
and to lose it
in the final moment, mmm...

25:26.220 --> 25:30.529
now, that could put poison
in a man's heart.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.361
Mr. Leung, will you excuse me
for a minute, please?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.676
Yeah, sorry, buddy.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.331
Still nothing
out of motormouth George.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.638
Right now, I want us to focus
on Conor Boyle

25:52.681 --> 25:53.900
and this Karl Ludwig guy.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.554
Okay? I'm almost 100% certain

25:55.597 --> 25:57.338
there's some kind
of currency deal going down.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.036
Now, if Tommy Boyle's death
was not a suicide,

26:00.080 --> 26:02.038
my gut is telling me
that all of this

26:02.082 --> 26:04.127
has something to do with
the motive behind that murder.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.390
All right, I'm on it.

26:25.888 --> 26:27.716
Mr. Leung, thank you
very much, uh,

26:27.760 --> 26:29.239
for your time.
Really appreciate it.

26:29.283 --> 26:32.503
You know, it's only courteous
to return a favor.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.246
Of course. Yeah.
What can I do for you?

26:36.290 --> 26:37.726
Well, as you can see,
my grandson

26:37.770 --> 26:40.381
needs a new
sparring partner.

26:40.424 --> 26:43.427
It would, uh, be my honor.

26:43.471 --> 26:44.951
No, no, not you.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.518
But the one in the back
with the big mouth.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.530
Don't want to fight this guy.
Why do I gotta fight?

26:59.574 --> 27:01.358
That's so stupid.You don't have a choice.
Come on.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.230
Uh, yes, I do have a choice.
I have a ch...

27:03.273 --> 27:04.840
I'm a cop, okay?
I don't have to participate

27:04.884 --> 27:06.363
in this goofball's
Bruce Lee kung fu fantasy.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.843
I don't have to do that.
You understand?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.671
I do have a choice. What?Listen to me. Listen to me.

27:09.715 --> 27:10.977
Take your shirt off.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.243
Okay. All right.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.461
Oh, one more thing.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.898
Make sure you don't
hit him, okay?

27:18.941 --> 27:20.029
:
What?

27:20.073 --> 27:21.291
Don't hit the kid.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.685
What do you want me
to do, bite him?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.295
You're supposed to lose, Danny.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.776
I'm supposed to lose?That's the thing.

27:27.820 --> 27:28.951
I'm gonna...
you want me to...

27:28.995 --> 27:30.126
It's bad enough
I gotta participate

27:30.170 --> 27:31.954
in this stupid thing--
you want me to lose

27:31.998 --> 27:33.216
on top of it all?
Okay.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.870
Unless you want
to walk out of here

27:34.914 --> 27:37.307
in a hail of bullets,
just get in there and lose.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.787
All right? Come on.

27:40.833 --> 27:44.053
I don't know why I gotta
wear gloves. I can't hit him.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.968
Well, you gotta make it
look like you're trying.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.666
DANNY:
This is the dumbest thing,
the most embarrassing,

27:47.709 --> 27:48.928
stupidest, dumbest thing

27:48.971 --> 27:50.886
you ever got me involved in
ever in my life.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.148
Excuse me.
If it's any consolation,

27:52.192 --> 27:53.672
I'd rather it was me

27:53.715 --> 27:55.412
who was gonna take
this beating, all right,

27:55.456 --> 27:56.892
but he chose you.
I'm sorry.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.807
Did you say "beating"?
I'm not taking a beating.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.157
Hey, stop talking.
You're embarrassing me now.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.593
I'm embarrassing you?

28:04.857 --> 28:07.729
Wing-Chun style.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.339
"Wing" what?

28:09.383 --> 28:11.080
You will fight Wing-Chun style.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.821
Okay.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.736
I don't know what that is.Yeah, you do.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
Wax on, wax off.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.002
STEVE:
Come on, let's go.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.003
Let's go.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.091
Don't touch me ever.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.571
Begin.

28:26.269 --> 28:29.055
Oh, give me a second.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.056
All right.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.232
Go easy. Come on.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.626
Okay. All right.

28:41.589 --> 28:42.590
Hey!

28:46.768 --> 28:47.900
STEVE:
Hey.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.730
He's doing really good, okay?

28:51.773 --> 28:54.863
Back up and take a breath.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.171
What are you doing?You know how hard it is

28:58.214 --> 28:59.781
to let somebody swing
at you and not hit back?

28:59.825 --> 29:01.217
It's impossible.Do me a favor.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.045
Just take the beat so we can
get out of here, will you?

29:03.089 --> 29:05.656
Come on.
Just don't hit him. Go.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.701
DANNY:
All right.

29:09.443 --> 29:10.400
All right.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.195
Hey, hey!

29:28.157 --> 29:30.246
Hey. My bad, man.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.552
You...

29:31.595 --> 29:33.293
You all right?

29:41.605 --> 29:42.955
I'm impressed.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.434
I didn't mean any disrespect.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.132
You would have been

29:46.175 --> 29:48.264
had you not fought back.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.224
He's very good.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.013
Excuse me.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.973
Lou, what do you got?

30:01.016 --> 30:02.278
GROVER:
All right, so I spoke

30:02.322 --> 30:04.324
to the lead FBI agent
surveilling the Boyles.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.760
You were right.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.327
Wasn't Tommy; it was Conor

30:07.370 --> 30:09.372
who was the center
of that investigation.

30:09.416 --> 30:12.288
Well, him and that other bird,
Karl Ludwig.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.073
So this was about money.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.770
Yeah, it is.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.686
You see, when German banks
converted to the euro,

30:18.729 --> 30:20.819
Ludwig was the guy appointed
to destroy

30:20.862 --> 30:23.256
the old currency,
but, of course...

30:23.299 --> 30:25.301
He saved some
for a rainy day, huh?

30:25.345 --> 30:28.304
Well, yeah.
Problem is, you got yourself

30:28.348 --> 30:30.741
a handful of deutschmarks
these days,

30:30.785 --> 30:33.005
all you got is a handful
of dirty paper.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.180
Unless...

30:34.223 --> 30:35.485
you can get rid of 'em.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.531
Okay, which you need to do
at a central bank.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.185
And if Ludwig does that,
he incriminates himself,

30:39.228 --> 30:40.490
so he sells them to Conor.

30:40.534 --> 30:41.970
That's right,
and the FBI figured

30:42.014 --> 30:44.277
there was some sort of
money-laundering thing at play,

30:44.320 --> 30:48.150
so they gotta wait, let Conor
complete his transaction,

30:48.194 --> 30:49.543
and then move in on 'em.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.892
And?

30:50.936 --> 30:52.198
Conor and Ludwig got the jump

30:52.241 --> 30:53.982
on the Feds
before they could move in,

30:54.026 --> 30:56.506
and that's when they went
to ground.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.640
Hey.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.642
What'd you do, take the
scenic route or something?

31:01.685 --> 31:03.644
Long story short--
this idiot made me get into

31:03.687 --> 31:05.211
a kung fu fight
with another idiot.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.995
TANI: Ugh, I want to come
with you guys next time.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.823
You have more fun.You guys got something?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.043
What?Well, we still got nothing

31:11.086 --> 31:12.696
on Conor or Ludwig,
but we may have

31:12.740 --> 31:13.959
a lead on Cammy's location.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.221
GROVER:
We're taking
a deeper listen

31:15.264 --> 31:18.224
into Cammy's voice mail
to see if there were

31:18.267 --> 31:20.704
maybe some, uh,
location-dependent sound.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.228
Here's the enhanced
background sound.

31:28.234 --> 31:31.150
That sounds like...
metal on metal, right?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.412
Some kind of...

31:32.455 --> 31:33.717
big door latching.

31:33.761 --> 31:34.849
I hear echoes.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.024
Maybe she moved into
an enclosed space.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.852
GROVER:
We're thinking the same thing.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.506
Okay, that could be
anywhere on the island.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.987
The last message she left on her
phone before she got cut off,

31:42.030 --> 31:43.989
I think she was trying to
say she was in Eva Beach.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.729
There's a couple old rail cars
down there

31:45.773 --> 31:47.906
where we used to hang out
when we were kids.

31:47.949 --> 31:48.950
I mean, it's isolated.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.604
There are a lot
of places to hide.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.693
All right.
Let's hope you're right.

31:52.736 --> 31:53.912
Yeah. Tani?

31:53.955 --> 31:55.261
Yeah.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.792
Man, I should have picked up.

32:06.359 --> 32:09.405
I thought she was just calling
again to meet up for lunch.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.061
What do you mean, Junes?

32:13.105 --> 32:16.630
Cammy, she...
she called me a few weeks back.

32:16.673 --> 32:19.241
She wanted to meet up for lunch.

32:19.285 --> 32:22.070
She was Layla's best friend.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.943
There's no way I wanted to talk
about my ex leaving me

32:24.986 --> 32:27.380
or what happened in Iraq.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.556
I just figured,

32:29.599 --> 32:30.774
you know...

32:30.818 --> 32:33.038
I'd call her back
when the time was right.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.998
So you sent the call
to voice mail?

32:37.042 --> 32:38.957
Yeah.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.831
I didn't mean for any
of this stuff to happen.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.093
Yeah, of course
you didn't.Sorry.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.140
Come on, Junes.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.968
This isn't your fault.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.187
It's not.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.797
Even if you
answered the phone,

32:53.841 --> 32:55.799
there's no way you could
have saved her mother.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.193
But what if picking up meant

32:58.237 --> 33:00.326
I saved Cammy?

TOMMY:
You brought me
this deal, son.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.592

Respect my decision.

My mother treated cops.

Huh? You go to see your father.
He turns you down.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.104
Says he's not gonna fund this
little currency deal of yours,

39:28.148 --> 39:29.845

Go ahead, Junior.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.024
Okay, so autopsy results show

39:35.068 --> 39:38.593
that your father had a substance
in his body called tetrodotoxin.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.160
It's a paralyzing agent.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.684
Stops a victim from moving
any muscle in their body.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.207
They can't even scream,
but you know what?

39:44.251 --> 39:45.600
They can feel pain.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.950
And you knew he was having
acupuncture that day.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.953
And you figured no one would
notice another needle hole

39:50.997 --> 39:52.564

39:52.607 --> 39:54.217
Mei and her daughter
were gonna be there.

session ran late.

kill your father,

You go after them.
