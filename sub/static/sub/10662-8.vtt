The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:08.893 --> 00:10.829
(stifled sob)

00:10.830 --> 00:12.896
(crying)

00:16.067 --> 00:17.570
- JERROD: <i>Hey, y'all.
- (door closing)</i>

00:17.571 --> 00:19.404
JOE: <i>Cynthia, the kids are here.</i>

00:20.505 --> 00:22.807
Okay, I'll be out in a minute!

00:22.808 --> 00:24.075
(crying)

00:24.076 --> 00:26.144
Aw, look how cute everybody is all

00:26.145 --> 00:27.846
color coordinated for the family photo.

00:27.847 --> 00:28.813
Yeah,

00:28.814 --> 00:30.295
let's hurry up and take this picture.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.663
Maxine and I look like mannequins

00:31.664 --> 00:33.918
in a Kanye West outlet mall.

00:33.919 --> 00:36.187
Wait, wait, wait, we
were <i>supposed</i> to match?

00:36.188 --> 00:37.689
I just threw this on this morning.

00:37.690 --> 00:38.656
(laughs)

00:38.657 --> 00:40.492
Power of the universe.

00:40.493 --> 00:41.760
All right, now, boys,

00:41.761 --> 00:44.229
me and your mama sat up
for an hour last night

00:44.230 --> 00:46.213
trying to figure out which
pose we gonna do today.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.299
It's either kids between adult legs,

00:48.300 --> 00:49.868
peek-a-boo style or a pyramid.

00:49.869 --> 00:52.237
Now, look, I've put on a little weight,

00:52.238 --> 00:53.799
so, Jerrod, you and
Bobby get over there

00:53.800 --> 00:55.303
and see if you can support my weight.

00:55.304 --> 00:57.108
Oh, yeah, this'll be fun.

00:57.109 --> 00:59.177
You know, I was head
cheerleader so I can be on top.

00:59.178 --> 01:00.278
Oh, yeah, that'd be good...

01:00.279 --> 01:02.046
Your mama ain't gonna
let her be on top.

01:02.047 --> 01:03.014
Cynthia...

01:03.015 --> 01:04.282
Oh!

01:04.283 --> 01:05.784
Maxine, you should knock before you

01:05.785 --> 01:07.317
come into a kitchen.

01:09.387 --> 01:10.555
Are you crying?

01:10.556 --> 01:11.956
No.

01:11.957 --> 01:13.658
Well, Cynthia, you're obviously crying.

01:13.659 --> 01:15.126
You know, Maxine,

01:15.127 --> 01:18.329
sometimes you harp on things
and it is really annoying.

01:18.330 --> 01:19.764
(sighs)

01:19.765 --> 01:21.428
JOE: Bobby, get your
ass up off the floor.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.534
You know you ain't hurt.

01:22.535 --> 01:25.203
Joe, I told you, kids between

01:25.204 --> 01:27.071
adult legs peek-a-boo style!

01:27.072 --> 01:29.507
Um, did something happen to you?

01:29.508 --> 01:30.508
(sighs)

01:30.509 --> 01:32.510
Enough of the questions, Maxine.

01:32.511 --> 01:33.978
Let's talk about what's gonna happen

01:33.979 --> 01:35.947
when you leave this kitchen.

01:35.948 --> 01:39.751
I don't want you saying anything
about this to anyone, okay?

01:39.752 --> 01:41.015
Well, but, I just think that...

01:41.016 --> 01:42.187
Listen, I...

01:42.188 --> 01:44.255
am not one to threaten anyone

01:44.256 --> 01:48.392
with physical violence, but...

01:50.595 --> 01:54.365
...I'm willing to do what I have
to do to keep this a secret.

01:54.366 --> 01:56.667
Uh, I just want to make
sure that you're okay.

01:58.403 --> 01:59.938
You know what, Maxine,

01:59.939 --> 02:01.805
I'm getting a snitch vibe from you.

02:04.976 --> 02:07.612
You know what happens to snitches.

02:07.613 --> 02:10.146
They get stitches.

02:11.316 --> 02:14.184
No, they get dead.

02:15.587 --> 02:18.155

02:39.165 --> 02:40.498
Now let me run and get dressed.

02:40.499 --> 02:41.666
I don't want us to be late.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.967
Take your time.

02:42.968 --> 02:44.536
We still working on this pyramid.

02:44.537 --> 02:46.738
That ain't the way you do a pyramid.

02:46.739 --> 02:48.162
What's the point of having two boys

02:48.163 --> 02:49.996
if y'all can't even pick me up?

02:51.342 --> 02:52.844
Um, has anyone noticed

02:52.845 --> 02:54.379
anything off about Cynthia lately?

02:54.380 --> 02:56.483
Well, she agreed to let you
be in the family picture,

02:56.484 --> 02:57.783
that's a little weird.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.919
I told her she could cut you out.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.854
You know, with, uh,
Photoshop these days,

03:02.855 --> 03:04.723
you can have the family you want

03:04.724 --> 03:06.390
instead of the family you got.

03:07.292 --> 03:08.593
Yeah, you could

03:08.594 --> 03:09.994
Photoshop anything now.

03:09.995 --> 03:11.996
Look, there's no reason
why you should be online

03:11.997 --> 03:13.465
looking ugly, okay.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.800
Technology cured ugliness.

03:15.801 --> 03:17.602
Look, I really think

03:17.603 --> 03:18.737
that there's something wrong with her.

03:18.738 --> 03:20.338
Maxine, you obviously know something.

03:20.339 --> 03:21.539
Just tell us.

03:21.540 --> 03:22.707
Don't make us fish around

03:22.708 --> 03:24.209
for answers to clear your conscience.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.443
If you're gonna snitch, just snitch.

03:27.679 --> 03:29.128
Look, I saw your mom

03:29.129 --> 03:30.272
crying in the kitchen, okay?

03:30.273 --> 03:32.173
Snitch, snitch, snitch.

03:32.965 --> 03:33.999
Joe, do we have to wait

03:34.000 --> 03:34.967
until after the photo

03:34.968 --> 03:37.203
before we crop her out?

03:37.204 --> 03:38.504
Look, Cynthia, I'm sorry.

03:38.505 --> 03:40.606
Of course, I had to tell them,
I'm worried about you.

03:40.607 --> 03:42.775
Wait, Mama, y-y-you okay?

03:42.776 --> 03:43.839
Look, just say you're okay

03:43.840 --> 03:45.911
even if you not okay, okay?

03:45.912 --> 03:47.313
Bobby...

03:47.314 --> 03:49.782
I am sure there's a legit reason

03:49.783 --> 03:51.183
why Mom was crying in the kitchen.

03:51.184 --> 03:53.786
I mean, Maxine's a very caring
person, but sometimes she looks

03:53.787 --> 03:55.421
for emotions where there aren't any.

03:55.422 --> 03:57.325
Like if I'm quiet at home
for more than an hour,

03:57.326 --> 03:58.657
she keeps probing for answers

03:58.658 --> 04:00.993
until I got to make up
a lie about my father.

04:00.994 --> 04:02.161
Dad, I'm sorry.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.763
It's the only way to get her to stop.

04:03.764 --> 04:05.097
(Cynthia sighs)

04:05.098 --> 04:07.032
Nothing is wrong, Bobby.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.901
I just get a little sad.

04:08.902 --> 04:11.137
I mean, sadness doesn't need a reason.

04:11.138 --> 04:13.172
I just have all these feelings.

04:13.173 --> 04:14.507
Look, your mama doesn't have to

04:14.508 --> 04:15.808
explain herself to you.

04:15.809 --> 04:17.442
She's had the blues lately.

04:17.444 --> 04:20.112
You know, crying from time to time,

04:20.113 --> 04:22.881
taking naps that turn
into for real sleeping.

04:24.016 --> 04:25.651
The big thing is your mama handled this

04:25.652 --> 04:26.919
all on her own.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.053
No, I think the big thing is

04:28.054 --> 04:30.089
that she was crying
alone in the kitchen.

04:30.090 --> 04:32.353
Yeah, and what do you mean
by she's had the blues lately?

04:32.354 --> 04:34.093
Has this been happening a lot, Cynthia?

04:34.094 --> 04:37.596
I don't know, maybe
five, six, seven weeks.

04:37.597 --> 04:40.032
Oh, here comes the tears.

04:40.033 --> 04:41.200
Ma...

04:41.201 --> 04:42.608
you've been crying alone

04:42.609 --> 04:44.276
f-for five or six, seven weeks?

04:44.277 --> 04:45.744
That's a huge problem.

04:45.745 --> 04:48.008
Oh, that ain't... Five or six,
seven weeks ain't nothing.

04:48.009 --> 04:50.075
I had colds longer than that.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.384
Dad, that's a huge problem, too.

04:52.385 --> 04:53.519
Get that checked out.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.487
You probably got walking
pneumonia or something.

04:55.488 --> 04:57.056
Jerrod, when you were a teenager,

04:57.057 --> 04:59.158
you had the blues all the time.

04:59.159 --> 05:02.027
No, Ma, that's called being a teenager.

05:02.028 --> 05:05.196
Wait, yeah, Jerrod,
you did get dumped a lot.

05:06.465 --> 05:10.869
Again, it's called being a teenager.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.571
Uh, Cynthia, can you try and describe

05:12.572 --> 05:14.273
how you feel when you get like this?

05:14.274 --> 05:15.908
Well, I don't know, it's...

05:15.909 --> 05:18.944
I-it's that feeling like
a wave just hits you

05:18.945 --> 05:21.980
and you can't breathe,
and each wave is-is bigger

05:21.981 --> 05:24.783
than the last wave and
it's just pushing you further

05:24.784 --> 05:26.885
and further away from shore,

05:26.886 --> 05:28.420
and you try to come up for air

05:28.421 --> 05:29.588
but you can't.

05:29.589 --> 05:31.190
You know. The blues.

05:31.191 --> 05:33.859
No, don't-don't say you're
drowning and you feel like

05:33.860 --> 05:35.227
you're gasping for air, casually,

05:35.228 --> 05:36.895
and call it, "the blues,"

05:36.896 --> 05:38.230
and expect us not to be upset.

05:38.231 --> 05:40.199
Cynthia, that sounds like depression.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.400
Depression?!

05:41.401 --> 05:42.934
Wait, that's what that is?

05:44.336 --> 05:45.404
I've just been calling it,

05:45.405 --> 05:47.405
"the case of the Mondays" for years.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.711
Maxine, honey, working class
people don't get depression.

05:52.712 --> 05:55.514
Depression is a luxury
of wealth and free time.

05:55.515 --> 05:56.682
Mm-hmm.

05:56.683 --> 05:58.617
That is right.

05:58.618 --> 06:01.787
Depression is a disease
of the opulent, you know,

06:01.788 --> 06:05.190
like, um, affluenza or that...

06:05.191 --> 06:07.092
truffle fingers.

06:07.093 --> 06:10.395
Dad, there is no way truffle
fingers is a real thing.

06:10.396 --> 06:12.231
No, depression isn't real.

06:12.232 --> 06:13.799
That's something rich people made up

06:13.800 --> 06:15.834
'cause they were bored
and they wanted to add

06:15.835 --> 06:17.435
some adversity to their lives.

06:18.637 --> 06:21.340
Imagine how boring Justin
Bieber's bio would be

06:21.341 --> 06:23.842
if it didn't say he had depression.

06:23.843 --> 06:28.412
It would say birth,
instant fame, dead at 27.

06:30.415 --> 06:31.718
I ain't trying to wish something

06:31.719 --> 06:33.719
on the boy, but I see the signs.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.487
No, no, no, I get it,
I get it, all right.

06:35.488 --> 06:36.922
We were raised in an environment

06:36.923 --> 06:39.026
where we were taught to
believe depression isn't real

06:39.027 --> 06:42.294
and we're supposed to ignore it
'cause it makes us appear weak.

06:42.295 --> 06:44.129
However, it is a real thing,

06:44.130 --> 06:45.593
and I don't want you two ignoring it

06:45.594 --> 06:47.566
the way we ignore Uncle
Jack's depression.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.368
Your Uncle Jack is not depressed.

06:49.369 --> 06:52.137
Uncle Jack hasn't left
his house in 15 years.

06:52.138 --> 06:54.506
Well, he has a very nice house.

06:54.507 --> 06:55.507
That is not true.

06:55.508 --> 06:56.909
He does not have a very nice house.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.133
Well, it must be kind of nice,

06:58.134 --> 07:00.245
he's been in there for 15 years!

07:00.246 --> 07:01.713
Hey, y'all.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.349
Joe, I got your text
about the family photo,

07:04.350 --> 07:07.653
and she ready to be the
base of this pyramid.

07:07.654 --> 07:10.322
Hey, Nekeisha, your braids
and aggressive demeanor

07:10.323 --> 07:11.986
tell us you've been
through a lot of pain.

07:11.987 --> 07:13.592
Would you please

07:13.593 --> 07:15.160
explain to my parents

07:15.161 --> 07:16.595
that depression is a real thing?

07:16.596 --> 07:18.530
I thought depression was
one of those things that

07:18.531 --> 07:21.233
only rich people get, like
tennis elbow or skin cancer.

07:21.234 --> 07:22.401
Thank you!

07:22.402 --> 07:23.936
Told you!

07:23.937 --> 07:25.237
Who's depressed? Bobby?

07:25.238 --> 07:26.905
They talking about me.

07:26.906 --> 07:28.507
Who's talking? Maxine?

07:28.508 --> 07:31.376
Mm-hmm, who else?

07:31.377 --> 07:33.345
I'm sorry, I go to school for this,

07:33.346 --> 07:35.280
and I'm not trying to
diagnose you or anything,

07:35.281 --> 07:37.216
but I know how to look for the signs,

07:37.217 --> 07:39.785
and Jerrod agrees with me, too.

07:39.786 --> 07:41.787
Yeah, yeah, I know
it's out of character

07:41.788 --> 07:43.755
for me, but I do, I agree.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.757
You know what the problem
is in this country?

07:45.758 --> 07:46.992
Over-diagnosis.

07:46.993 --> 07:48.260
You drink too much coffee?

07:48.261 --> 07:50.529
Well, oh, you got ADHD.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.664
You stay up late, you got insomnia.

07:52.665 --> 07:54.366
You speed up on a pedestrian,

07:54.367 --> 07:56.150
they try to charge you
with attempted murder.

07:56.151 --> 07:58.604
Labels! Labels.

07:58.605 --> 08:02.441
All right, we've talked
enough about depression.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.508
(laughs)

08:03.509 --> 08:06.011
Listen, I have a $20 off coupon

08:06.012 --> 08:08.247
at Sears for family portraits

08:08.248 --> 08:10.082
and this is the day it expires,

08:10.083 --> 08:11.183
so let's go.

08:11.184 --> 08:12.217
No, w-w-wait,

08:12.218 --> 08:13.841
we're not just gonna
ignore this, are we?

08:13.842 --> 08:14.519
No, we're not.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.621
Well, which one of you

08:15.622 --> 08:17.356
is gonna pay the extra $20?

08:17.357 --> 08:19.791
Look, I just think that
we need to talk about

08:19.792 --> 08:21.293
Cynthia maybe seeing a therapist.

08:21.294 --> 08:22.794
A therapist?!

08:22.795 --> 08:24.862
(laughs)

08:26.131 --> 08:28.232
(Joe and Nekeisha laughing)

08:30.902 --> 08:32.571
Dad, Dad, do you mind if I talk to you

08:32.572 --> 08:33.715
in the kitchen for a second?

08:33.716 --> 08:34.773
No, I don't get called

08:34.774 --> 08:36.273
into rooms in my own house.

08:38.443 --> 08:40.879
Should be lucky I want
a soda right now.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.015
Ah, and remember, I lead first.

08:43.015 --> 08:45.217
If I've learned anything
from <i>The Dog Whisperer,</i>

08:45.218 --> 08:48.220
it's to establish dominance early.

08:48.221 --> 08:51.423
Look, Dad, Mom needs help.

08:51.424 --> 08:53.992
Since when did you become Mr. Therapy?

08:53.993 --> 08:55.627
Maxine?

08:55.628 --> 08:56.995
Who else?

08:56.996 --> 08:57.963
But she's right.

08:57.964 --> 08:59.598
You know, she helps a lot of people

08:59.599 --> 09:01.133
a-and I've seen it.

09:01.134 --> 09:02.597
I mean, I wasn't supposed to see it,

09:02.598 --> 09:04.979
but I looked through some files
'cause I couldn't sleep...

09:06.471 --> 09:09.074
...and those files didn't
help me sleep at all.

09:09.075 --> 09:11.410
Look, I know you mean well,

09:11.411 --> 09:13.979
but your mother isn't the
type to go for therapy.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.014
She's strong, not crazy.

09:16.015 --> 09:18.417
But she's had, like,
six or seven weeks to talk

09:18.418 --> 09:20.585
to someone and she's not
talking to any of us,

09:20.586 --> 09:22.688
so maybe she should see a therapist.

09:22.689 --> 09:24.752
Well, I don't want anybody
tampering with your mama.

09:24.753 --> 09:27.092
I love her just the way she is.

09:27.093 --> 09:29.194
Look, Dad, no one's
gonna tamper with Mom.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.818
It's just gonna make
her a better version

09:30.819 --> 09:32.230
of who she already is.

09:32.231 --> 09:35.400
Why are you young people so
in love with self-improvement?

09:35.401 --> 09:37.803
You got to get to know
who you really are

09:37.804 --> 09:38.987
or you gonna wind up changing

09:38.988 --> 09:41.039
that one thing about you that's unique.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.275
There's nothing wrong
with being sad sometimes.

09:43.276 --> 09:45.743
Look at Amy Winehouse, beautiful music.

09:53.452 --> 09:55.320
She's dead.

09:55.321 --> 09:57.189
And I want Mom

09:57.190 --> 10:00.692
to be okay, so despite all
of our feelings about therapy,

10:00.693 --> 10:03.595
Mom is in a lot of pain right
now so I'm gonna go out there

10:03.596 --> 10:05.230
and I'm gonna tell her
she needs to see a therapist,

10:05.231 --> 10:06.531
whether you agree or not.

10:06.532 --> 10:08.266
Wait, you can't show
dominance in my house!

10:08.267 --> 10:09.468
I'm the alpha!

10:09.469 --> 10:12.771
So, by my third foster home,
I was so confused.

10:12.772 --> 10:15.173
I mean, I was 16 and I wasn't even sure

10:15.174 --> 10:17.275
if I was even capable of love anymore.

10:17.276 --> 10:18.677
Hmm, so what did you do?

10:18.678 --> 10:21.413
I mean, you seem to be
functioning okay now.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.077
Only because I had
finally got the courage

10:23.078 --> 10:25.317
to call someone, Mark, actually.

10:25.318 --> 10:27.252
Wait, why did you laugh
earlier if you've been

10:27.253 --> 10:28.420
to therapy before?

10:28.421 --> 10:30.489
No, Mark is not a therapist.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.122
He sells weed, okay?

10:34.359 --> 10:37.129
Weed is a coping mechanism.

10:37.130 --> 10:39.264
See, Cynthia, there's two ways

10:39.265 --> 10:40.932
to handle a problem, okay?

10:40.933 --> 10:43.769
Way number one: you can take it head on,

10:43.770 --> 10:45.537
and run into it,
and just fight it out...

10:45.538 --> 10:47.606
or you could take a hit of weed

10:47.607 --> 10:49.741
and forget all your problems.

10:49.742 --> 10:51.643
Now, you gonna forget
some good things, too,

10:51.644 --> 10:54.012
but it's worth it.

10:54.013 --> 10:56.515
Well, look, Ma, I'm worried about you.

10:56.516 --> 10:58.077
There's obviously
something very serious

10:58.078 --> 10:59.901
happening with you and
it could be depression.

10:59.902 --> 11:00.886
MAXINE: Yeah,

11:00.887 --> 11:02.608
and if it is depression,
you need to talk to

11:02.609 --> 11:04.677
a professional about it
before it gets worse.

11:04.678 --> 11:07.459
Yep, one day you're cleaning...

11:07.460 --> 11:09.294
and the next day, you're slowly walking

11:09.295 --> 11:11.362
around in front of a pond.

11:12.764 --> 11:17.369
Why do depression commercials
always got a pond in it?

11:17.370 --> 11:20.304
I mean, I think ponds
are happy, you know?

11:21.440 --> 11:25.410
Look, I'm just trying to
contribute, y'all, come on.

11:25.411 --> 11:28.413
All right, listen,
I am going to handle this

11:28.414 --> 11:29.581
in my own way.

11:29.582 --> 11:31.550
It is none of your concern.

11:31.551 --> 11:34.219
The only thing you guys
have to do is smile

11:34.220 --> 11:37.055
when the guy behind that
camera says, "Cheese."

11:37.056 --> 11:39.124
Look, Ma, here's the deal.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.860
Nobody is taking that picture
until you see a therapist.

11:41.861 --> 11:43.604
- (gasps)
- I'm not gonna take that picture,

11:43.605 --> 11:45.096
Maxine's not gonna take that picture,

11:45.097 --> 11:46.978
and Bobby's not gonna
take that picture, either.

11:46.979 --> 11:48.213
I'm including you in this.

11:48.214 --> 11:50.135
My man.

11:50.136 --> 11:51.703
Joe, do you hear them?

11:51.704 --> 11:53.038
So, that's your plan?

11:53.039 --> 11:54.606
That's low, son.

11:54.607 --> 11:57.375
Manipulating your mama
into bettering herself.

11:57.376 --> 11:58.443
We don't need them.

11:58.444 --> 12:00.227
We can take our own picture,
just me and you.

12:00.228 --> 12:02.328
I don't want a picture of me and you.

12:04.449 --> 12:07.919
Jerrod, stop holding the
family portrait hostage.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.021
I'm sorry, Mom, but you
leave me no choice.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.090
Fine, fine.

12:12.091 --> 12:14.326
One session.

12:14.327 --> 12:16.361
I will go to one session,

12:16.362 --> 12:20.565
but I am going to wear a big hat
and sunglasses, like Jackie O,

12:20.566 --> 12:23.835
because I can't be seen
going into therapy.

12:23.836 --> 12:26.103
I have a reputation to uphold.

12:34.527 --> 12:36.275
You don't need to wear those.

12:36.304 --> 12:38.606
This is how the poker
players hide their tells.

12:38.607 --> 12:40.674
I'm-a see how good your mind reader is.

12:40.675 --> 12:43.277
See if she can see
through these shades.

12:43.278 --> 12:44.778
There is no point in doing this

12:44.779 --> 12:46.322
if you're not gonna take it seriously.

12:46.323 --> 12:48.249
Fine.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.950
But I'm not taking off the hat.

12:49.951 --> 12:54.187
I built this entire
outfit around this hat.

12:55.456 --> 12:56.790
(sighs)

12:56.791 --> 12:58.292
Now what?

12:58.293 --> 12:59.727
We just fill out these forms

12:59.728 --> 13:01.195
and wait for your name to be called.

13:01.196 --> 13:03.496
She's gonna call my name out loud?

13:04.298 --> 13:05.900
I need an alias.

13:05.901 --> 13:08.535
Put down Diana Ross.

13:08.536 --> 13:10.070
No, no, Star Jones.

13:10.071 --> 13:12.105
Everybody knows she crazy.

13:13.173 --> 13:16.110
Nancy Grace, final answer.

13:16.111 --> 13:18.712
No one here is going to judge you.

13:18.713 --> 13:20.414
I don't know why not.

13:20.415 --> 13:22.816
I'm judging them.

13:22.817 --> 13:23.918
Psst.

13:23.919 --> 13:26.953
Psst, what you in here for?

13:27.855 --> 13:28.923
I'm sorry.

13:28.924 --> 13:30.291
She's new to therapy.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.592
She the crazy one.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.359
I'm just her ride.

13:34.889 --> 13:36.330
Look, it's important that you answer

13:36.331 --> 13:37.965
these questions
as honestly as possible.

13:37.966 --> 13:39.233
Well...

13:39.234 --> 13:42.136
Shouldn't this place be more uplifting?

13:42.137 --> 13:44.939
They don't have no <i>Highlights</i> magazines

13:44.940 --> 13:48.242
or a colorful abacus
that I could play with?

13:48.243 --> 13:51.278
No, 'cause you're not
seeing a pediatrician.

13:51.279 --> 13:53.679
Cynthia Carmichael.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.317
Cynthia Carmichael.

14:00.621 --> 14:02.555
Snitch. (scoffs)

14:06.427 --> 14:08.529
Do you think Mom is
telling all our secrets?

14:08.530 --> 14:09.913
Bobby, you don't have any secrets.

14:09.914 --> 14:11.780
You post everything on Instagram.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.168
Shoot, I don't need no stranger

14:14.169 --> 14:15.803
to make me reveal my dark secrets.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.105
Bobby, when your mama
was pregnant with you,

14:18.106 --> 14:19.440
this woman who couldn't have kids

14:19.441 --> 14:21.575
offered us $10,000 for you.

14:21.576 --> 14:23.839
Now, I know that's not a lot
of money to pay for a child,

14:23.840 --> 14:27.381
but we did take the whole
weekend to think about it.

14:27.382 --> 14:30.584
Wow, thanks for keeping me.

14:30.585 --> 14:33.020
Well, the woman changed
her mind at the last minute.

14:33.021 --> 14:34.588
The whole deal fell through.

14:34.589 --> 14:35.656
What?

14:35.657 --> 14:38.058
You owe me an El Camino.

14:38.059 --> 14:39.960
Hey, how'd it go, baby?

14:39.961 --> 14:41.762
It did not go well, Joe.

14:41.763 --> 14:43.397
Don't speak for me, Maxine.

14:43.398 --> 14:45.599
It did not go well, Joe.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.868
Look, I don't want to know,
I don't want to know.

14:47.869 --> 14:49.136
They uncovered some...

14:49.137 --> 14:51.240
some deep, dark secrets
about you, didn't they, Mama?

14:51.241 --> 14:52.106
Huh?

14:52.107 --> 14:54.208
You got more than one personality?

14:54.209 --> 14:56.042
Are all them personalities my mama?

14:57.478 --> 14:59.113
Look, they didn't uncover anything

14:59.114 --> 15:00.217
'cause she didn't even try.

15:00.218 --> 15:01.715
Yes, I did.

15:01.716 --> 15:04.618
That therapist, she just
made me uncomfortable.

15:04.619 --> 15:07.788
She kept nodding her head
every time I said something,

15:07.789 --> 15:09.556
acting like she got me.

15:09.557 --> 15:12.058
Well, I was lying,
so I knew she didn't get me.

15:13.327 --> 15:14.328
That's my girl.

15:14.329 --> 15:15.329
Keep it in house.

15:15.330 --> 15:16.697
- (laughs)
- Ma...

15:16.698 --> 15:17.798
y-you lied?

15:17.799 --> 15:19.565
I mean, who leaves
therapy a worse person?

15:21.068 --> 15:23.470
Apparently, she thought
the therapist was asking her

15:23.471 --> 15:25.105
too many personal questions.

15:25.106 --> 15:27.089
I don't like anybody asking
me personal questions.

15:27.090 --> 15:27.875
Mm-hmm.

15:27.876 --> 15:28.842
Cynthia didn't even know

15:28.843 --> 15:31.278
my last name till we were married.

15:31.279 --> 15:33.380
Look, Ma, you had to know
how therapy worked.

15:33.381 --> 15:35.549
I mean, remember we
saw <i>Good Will Hunting</i>

15:35.550 --> 15:36.550
in theaters together.

15:36.551 --> 15:37.785
You kept yelling at the screen,

15:37.786 --> 15:39.286
"Somebody needs to
give that boy a hug!"

15:39.287 --> 15:40.288
Give your mother a break.

15:40.289 --> 15:41.552
She's been through a lot today.

15:41.553 --> 15:43.991
No, let's not give her a break, Joe.

15:43.992 --> 15:46.460
Giving her a break is what got
her here in the first place.

15:46.461 --> 15:47.594
Now, let's stop pretending.

15:47.595 --> 15:48.961
Did she raise her voice?

15:49.696 --> 15:52.566
You raise your voice?

15:52.567 --> 15:54.802
She raised her voice?!

15:54.803 --> 15:58.172
Yes, yes and yes.

15:58.173 --> 15:59.473
Cynthia,

15:59.474 --> 16:02.309
you are the only one who can
make a difference in this.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.811
Now if you had actually answered any

16:03.812 --> 16:04.978
of the therapist's questions,

16:04.979 --> 16:06.814
maybe you would have
gotten somewhere. I mean,

16:06.815 --> 16:08.755
isn't this the family that
just talks about everything?!

16:08.756 --> 16:10.373
Usually, I can't get
you guys to shut up

16:10.374 --> 16:11.918
- and now you're afraid to talk?!
- Oh!

16:11.919 --> 16:13.454
Well, I'm not afraid to say this:

16:13.455 --> 16:15.889
you are out of the family picture!

16:15.890 --> 16:16.957
- Okay, you two...
- Wait, wait, now,

16:16.958 --> 16:18.341
they fighting over your love, boy.

16:18.342 --> 16:19.193
Don't get involved.

16:19.194 --> 16:21.894
BOTH: This has nothing
to do with Jerrod!

16:22.629 --> 16:24.730
(mouthing)

16:26.166 --> 16:28.869
Now, Cynthia, why would I even
want to be in that picture?

16:28.870 --> 16:30.337
So I can look back at it and go,

16:30.338 --> 16:31.538
"Oh, hey, remember that time

16:31.539 --> 16:33.122
"Cynthia was suffering from depression?

16:33.123 --> 16:34.475
"That was so much fun!

16:34.476 --> 16:36.143
Look at that darkness behind her eyes."

16:36.144 --> 16:37.744
And-and behind Bobby's eyes.

16:37.745 --> 16:39.645
We're kindred spirits.

16:40.547 --> 16:42.783
Stop calling it depression!

16:42.784 --> 16:44.585
You don't even know what it is!

16:44.586 --> 16:46.649
Neither do you 'cause
you're too afraid to find out.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.689
Oh, Lord, what do you want from me?!

16:48.690 --> 16:50.157
Look, it is not about being crazy.

16:50.158 --> 16:51.758
It is about being honest with yourself,

16:51.759 --> 16:55.095
and figuring out exactly what
you're feeling without judging.

16:55.096 --> 16:57.097
Now, you were crying
in the kitchen one minute,

16:57.098 --> 16:59.500
but you're willing to put on
a fake smile for the cameraman

16:59.501 --> 17:00.524
the next, I mean, what...

17:00.525 --> 17:02.536
I have to put on a fake smile!

17:02.537 --> 17:03.770
I'm the mom!

17:03.771 --> 17:05.071
I'm the wife!

17:05.073 --> 17:07.839
The mom has to be happy in the picture!

17:09.710 --> 17:12.579
Now, the dad, he can have a stain

17:12.579 --> 17:13.547
on his shirt.

17:13.548 --> 17:15.148
His eyes can be closed.

17:15.150 --> 17:19.153
The kids can be snot-nosed
and crying, but the mom

17:19.154 --> 17:22.222
has to smile for the entire family!

17:22.223 --> 17:23.589
No matter what!

17:23.590 --> 17:25.726
No, no, I do not want to do this.

17:25.727 --> 17:28.127
Well, we're already doing it, Cynthia.

17:28.128 --> 17:29.863
Look, your feelings are valid.

17:29.864 --> 17:30.864
So, open up.

17:30.865 --> 17:32.599
Your-your family can handle it.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.001
Um... no...

17:39.506 --> 17:41.341
I actually can't handle it.

17:41.342 --> 17:43.310
Okay, no, Ma, we can handle it.

17:43.311 --> 17:44.645
We're here. We're listening.

17:44.646 --> 17:49.116
Well, it's just so hard
to explain, Jerrod.

17:49.117 --> 17:52.619
I mean, like, the other day,
I-I stopped at Wendy's,

17:52.620 --> 17:55.689
and I knew Bobby's order
because he always get

17:55.690 --> 17:57.291
that Junior Bacon and a Frosty,

17:57.292 --> 17:59.259
and-and-and Jerrod always says

17:59.260 --> 18:00.483
that he doesn't eat fast food,

18:00.484 --> 18:01.895
but he like that Crispy Chicken

18:01.896 --> 18:04.231
and Joe, he likes the Double Stack.

18:04.232 --> 18:06.733
Well, I usually just eat
whatever they have left over,

18:06.734 --> 18:09.970
you know, but then I was
at the window and...

18:09.971 --> 18:13.574
and I-I realized...

18:13.575 --> 18:14.741
I didn't even know

18:14.742 --> 18:17.277
my own order without theirs.

18:17.278 --> 18:21.315
I'm a grown woman and
I don't know what I like

18:21.316 --> 18:23.382
at Wendy's.

18:24.851 --> 18:28.921
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard in my life.

18:31.091 --> 18:32.893
I think it's amazing.

18:32.894 --> 18:36.796
This woman just said she don't
know how to order from Wendy's.

18:38.298 --> 18:40.767
You know, you really can't
go wrong with anything

18:40.768 --> 18:43.135
on that value menu, baby.

18:44.438 --> 18:47.073
Glad you're taking the right
things away from this, Dad.

18:48.242 --> 18:49.810
Cynthia, this is great.

18:49.811 --> 18:51.411
Now, it's not about Wendy's.

18:51.412 --> 18:53.046
You're thinking about yourself

18:53.047 --> 18:54.881
and your needs for the first time

18:54.882 --> 18:56.883
in who knows how long.

18:56.884 --> 18:58.585
That is a huge breakthrough.

18:58.586 --> 19:00.587
Well...

19:00.588 --> 19:02.456
(sighs)

19:02.457 --> 19:04.458
...it does feel good to talk about it.

19:04.459 --> 19:05.759
Well, great.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.227
Let's-let's keep going.

19:07.228 --> 19:09.129
Oh, no, Maxine.

19:09.130 --> 19:11.897
I'm going over to Wendy's.

19:16.003 --> 19:18.872
I'm gonna order everything on that menu

19:18.873 --> 19:23.642
until I figure out what
<i>Cynthia</i> likes to eat.

19:29.783 --> 19:31.618
You are good, Maxine.

19:31.619 --> 19:33.220
You are good.

19:33.221 --> 19:34.221
I know.

19:34.222 --> 19:35.422
(laughs)

19:35.423 --> 19:38.158
Cracked her open like a nut.

19:38.159 --> 19:39.926
I'm conflicted.

19:39.927 --> 19:42.929
A part of me is excited
for her breakthrough,

19:42.930 --> 19:44.598
but the other part of me

19:44.599 --> 19:47.301
kind of wants to go to Wendy's.

19:47.302 --> 19:50.070
Joe, let her have this one.

19:50.071 --> 19:52.005
I mean...

19:52.006 --> 19:56.310
we could just go to a
different Wendy's, right?

19:56.311 --> 19:58.879
See, this is what I'm
talking about, Maxine.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.547
Jerrod just had a breakthrough.

20:00.548 --> 20:03.011
Everybody's having
a breakthrough today.

20:03.012 --> 20:04.150
Let's go to Wendy's.

20:05.057 --> 20:07.860
It feels so good to open up like this.

20:07.861 --> 20:10.596
You know, I smoked through
both my pregnancies.

20:10.597 --> 20:11.731
(sighs)

20:11.732 --> 20:14.500
Oh, I never told anybody that before.

20:14.501 --> 20:16.769
All right, well,
our time is up for today.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.637
I told my husband that I didn't

20:18.638 --> 20:20.806
with the second baby, but I did.

20:20.807 --> 20:22.208
Oh. You know, and I'm afraid that

20:22.209 --> 20:25.344
that's why Jerrod is having
trouble gaining weight.

20:25.345 --> 20:27.446
I'm sorry, we're gonna
need to leave it here.

20:27.447 --> 20:29.482
Keep the meter running.

20:29.483 --> 20:34.053
Now, I know you're gonna
say that the jury was out

20:34.054 --> 20:36.489
on smoking while pregnant,
but it wasn't.

20:36.490 --> 20:39.592
I was sucking that hot
fire into my body.

20:39.593 --> 20:41.727
It's pretty obvious it wasn't healthy.

20:41.728 --> 20:44.430
Ooh, I sure do like this talking!

20:44.431 --> 20:46.565
It makes you feel good!

20:46.566 --> 20:48.367
You know, I don't have many friends,

20:48.368 --> 20:51.336
but the one I have,
Sylvia, both of her sons...
