<i>NARRATOR: George Michael was
playing a game of lie tag</i>

00:04.091 --> 00:06.051
<i>- with his father.
- Wait, I bet we're sitting</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.886
in the exact same traffic.

00:07.928 --> 00:10.388
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

00:10.430 --> 00:12.016
500 bucks they find a dead kid... 

00:12.057 --> 00:14.392
<i>Currently each claimed
to be stuck in traffic</i>

00:14.434 --> 00:17.313
<i>behind a light aircraft
that had landed on the 605.</i>

00:17.353 --> 00:19.731
Loving that kid too much and
letting him fly the plane.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.358
And... and you know what? One more thing.

00:21.399 --> 00:23.443
I think I accidentally had
the phone flipped around.

00:23.485 --> 00:26.197
I recorded my face the
whole time, you know?

00:26.238 --> 00:27.781
Smartphone, stupid man.

00:27.823 --> 00:29.658
Pal, why don't you loop
around and film this thing.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.118
Someone's got to tell the story.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.369
<i>Michael hung up feeling confident</i>

00:33.411 --> 00:34.872
<i>he'd had the last word.</i>

00:34.913 --> 00:37.333
- (phone chimes)
- Kidding me?

00:37.373 --> 00:39.084
GEORGE MICHAEL: Missed you again, damn.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.086
But, you know, I got out of my car here,

00:41.128 --> 00:43.172
and I'm, uh, standing
here now with a paramedic

00:43.214 --> 00:44.422
named Tim Ridge... Ridgley... 

00:44.464 --> 00:45.966
Can I record some video over there?

00:46.008 --> 00:47.718
- No cameras allowed.
- No camera... 

00:47.759 --> 00:49.511
They're being real tight-assed
about this camera thing.

00:49.553 --> 00:51.222
<i>But George Michael was
proving more adept at lying</i>

00:51.263 --> 00:52.681
<i>than anyone suspected.</i>

00:52.723 --> 00:54.183
Getting back in my car now.

00:54.225 --> 00:55.893
You know, thank God we
weren't on that plane.

00:55.934 --> 00:58.354
<i>Which would come in handy with a woman</i>

00:58.395 --> 01:01.732
<i>who only knew him as George Maharis.</i>

01:03.817 --> 01:04.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04.902 --> 01:07.404
Hey, sorry, that was my dad.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.365
He can be kind of hard to
get off the phone sometimes.

01:09.406 --> 01:11.408
(sighs) Tell me about it.
At least he wasn't drunk

01:11.449 --> 01:15.120
<i>and bitching about Don Ameche
not knowing his lines inCocoon.</i>

01:15.162 --> 01:16.747
He... he's actually great.

01:16.788 --> 01:19.083
If anything, I've been
kind of a lousy son lately,

01:19.124 --> 01:21.293
but, you know, it's just... 
I mean, at some point,

01:21.335 --> 01:23.087
I've got to start living my life.

01:23.128 --> 01:25.421
No, I know. I mean, my dad is
the nicest guy in the world,

01:25.463 --> 01:27.216
- but he just doesn't get it.
- (Elevator bell dings)

01:27.258 --> 01:28.717
I have to live my life my way.

01:28.759 --> 01:30.426
It's like he's always checking up on me.

01:30.468 --> 01:31.970
- Does yours do that?
- Yeah, no, once in a while.

01:32.012 --> 01:33.429
You want to go in here?

01:33.471 --> 01:35.724
(gasps) Yeah, okay.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.142
♪ ♪

01:37.184 --> 01:38.894
- MICHAEL: Ron.
- RON: Hey.

01:38.936 --> 01:41.230
No, no, it's Michael. Michael Bluth... 

01:41.272 --> 01:43.565
doing the film about my family and... 

01:43.607 --> 01:45.567
RON: Yeah, when are we gonna
get your kid's signature though?

01:45.609 --> 01:46.944
- MICHAEL: I'm working on it.
- Oh.

01:46.985 --> 01:48.320
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

01:48.362 --> 01:49.738
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

01:49.780 --> 01:51.240
but I think that he's blowing me off.

01:51.282 --> 01:53.284
RON: Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

01:53.325 --> 01:54.993
MICHAEL: Well, you know, a month ago,

01:55.035 --> 01:56.912
I would've told you that he
and I were exactly the same,

01:56.954 --> 01:58.080
that we were twins, you know?

01:58.122 --> 02:00.124
But now, I wouldn't even think of

02:00.165 --> 02:01.875
my son as my brother.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.752
<i>Although, in fairness,</i>

02:03.794 --> 02:07.798
<i>this is something a Bluth brother would do.</i>

02:07.839 --> 02:09.466
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

02:09.507 --> 02:12.010
<i>whose future was abruptly cancelled</i>

02:12.052 --> 02:14.346
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

02:14.388 --> 02:16.640
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

02:19.893 --> 02:23.521
<i>It's George Michael's Arrested Development.</i>

02:25.441 --> 02:28.485
<i>NARRATOR: George Michael was a new man.</i>

02:28.526 --> 02:30.362
<i>He had finally cast off the shackles</i>

02:30.404 --> 02:33.073
<i>- of his cautious persona,
- MAN: Come on, man, throw it.</i>

02:33.115 --> 02:36.868
<i>And he was ready to play with the big boys.</i>

02:36.910 --> 02:38.120
- Okay, I'm good!
- You all right?

02:38.162 --> 02:39.163
That's it for me.

02:39.204 --> 02:40.247
You guys keep playing.

02:40.289 --> 02:41.497
(laughs)

02:41.539 --> 02:44.251
Oh, too funny.

02:44.293 --> 02:45.794
- Oh!
- (Men cheering)

02:45.836 --> 02:47.921
<i>But later, at the student health center,</i>

02:47.963 --> 02:51.383
<i>he was reminded of the man
who'd always supported him... </i>

02:51.425 --> 02:53.509
Who would you like us to
call in case of an emergency?

02:53.551 --> 02:56.388
<i>And who he'd now twice hurt.</i>

02:56.430 --> 02:58.140
My dad.

02:58.182 --> 03:01.226
<i>And that night, Michael,
trying to impress Rebel</i>

03:01.268 --> 03:03.687
<i>by being a down-to-earth rich guy... </i>

03:03.728 --> 03:05.814
<i>although by doing so, he was neither... </i>

03:05.856 --> 03:07.899
Beverly Hills billionaires
who can't go two minutes

03:07.941 --> 03:09.818
<i>- without putting his phone... 
- Got this call.</i>

03:09.860 --> 03:11.403
I got to take this. Hold
on one second. Hello.

03:11.445 --> 03:12.779
Hey, George Michael.

03:12.821 --> 03:14.614
You stuck in traffic, pal?

03:14.656 --> 03:16.783
You know, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

03:16.825 --> 03:18.618
the other night, and,
uh, I miss you, you know.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.329
But I'm free all night if... 

03:20.371 --> 03:23.374
<i>But Michael hadn't forgiven George Michael.</i>

03:23.415 --> 03:25.334
People in politics involved and I just... 

03:25.376 --> 03:27.294
You know, I can't get away this time.

03:27.336 --> 03:32.383
<i>It seemed the two men were
growing less alike every day.</i>

03:32.424 --> 03:34.926
<i>And although George Michael felt guilty,</i>

03:34.968 --> 03:36.761
<i>- George Maharis was already
- Oh, God, I've got to get this.</i>

03:36.803 --> 03:39.473
<i>Planning his evening
with, as it turned out,</i>

03:39.515 --> 03:43.935
<i>someone who had also just
been put off by his father.</i>

03:43.977 --> 03:46.063
Hi, Rebel, it's George Mi... haris.

03:46.104 --> 03:48.773
My night just freed up, and I
was wondering if you wanted... 

03:48.815 --> 03:50.734
I thought you were having
dinner with your dad.

03:50.775 --> 03:53.487
Well, you know older guys... 
the night ends for them at 8:00.

03:53.529 --> 03:55.739
I think I could use a
break from the old guys.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.491
And I've already got
some birth control in me

03:57.533 --> 03:58.742
that I paid for myself,

03:58.783 --> 04:00.869
and I'd hate to let it go to waste.

04:00.911 --> 04:02.454
Well, that's perfect,

04:02.496 --> 04:05.332
because I'm not quite
ready to have children.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.044
<i>So, as he straightened up his room,</i>

04:09.086 --> 04:10.295
<i>- he got this call.
- (Cell phone ringing)</i>

04:10.337 --> 04:12.130
- Hey, Dad.
- George Michael, hey.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.465
Got out of it.

04:13.507 --> 04:15.842
I just... I made a ton of people angry,

04:15.884 --> 04:17.802
but you know what I always say: family... 

04:17.844 --> 04:20.805
Well, aw, gosh, you know, I
really wanted to, uh, do that,

04:20.846 --> 04:23.641
but I just had this work thing come up.

04:23.683 --> 04:25.143
And, uh, it's like you always say:

04:25.185 --> 04:27.312
family first, unless there's a work thing,

04:27.354 --> 04:29.314
and then work first.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.316
I have said that, too.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.818
- Uh, so another time.
- Okay.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.488
<i>But he had another problem
he had to deal with.</i>

04:36.530 --> 04:38.574
- P-Hound.
- Hey, George Michael.

04:38.615 --> 04:40.158
- Hey.
- Look, I got us a peace pizza.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.368
Oh, that's great... hey, you've got to go.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.911
What did you do with my stuff?

04:42.953 --> 04:44.662
- I've just got a girl coming over and... 
- Maeby?

04:44.704 --> 04:46.457
It's not Maeby, no. But,
um, could you please leave?

04:46.498 --> 04:48.208
Okay, first you "F" me with Fakeblock,

04:48.250 --> 04:49.834
and then you're gonna kick me out

04:49.876 --> 04:51.336
when you have a hottie coming over?

04:51.378 --> 04:52.712
- I have roommate rights.
- Well, you know what?

04:52.754 --> 04:54.756
You voided your rights when you took

04:54.798 --> 04:56.425
this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.343
- Not against the rules.
- Still a little weird,

04:58.385 --> 04:59.511
- don't you think?
- But not against the rules.

04:59.553 --> 05:00.554
- Well... 
- You know what?

05:00.596 --> 05:02.306
This is no longer a peace pizza.

05:02.347 --> 05:03.848
- That is a war pizza.
- Okay, that's fine.

05:03.890 --> 05:05.725
Do you want to take it back or... ?

05:05.767 --> 05:08.103
No, I already ate. Th... that's for you.

05:08.145 --> 05:09.687
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:09.729 --> 05:11.482
Enjoy your war pizza!

05:11.523 --> 05:14.943
<i>The pizza hadn't even
cooled before Rebel arrived.</i>

05:14.985 --> 05:17.195
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:17.237 --> 05:18.863
Oh, so this is a dorm.

05:18.905 --> 05:20.073
This is a dorm.

05:20.115 --> 05:23.243
Well, I suppose anything goes in a dorm.

05:23.285 --> 05:26.204
You got that right.

05:26.246 --> 05:28.624
Although, we should probably go inside,

05:28.664 --> 05:30.000
because they don't like us

05:30.041 --> 05:31.376
hanging out in the hallways, actually.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.587
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:36.298 --> 05:39.551
<i>George Michael had just
officially gotten over Maeby.</i>

05:39.593 --> 05:42.095
Thanks for, uh, keeping it down for my R.A.

05:42.137 --> 05:43.805
You were keeping it down, right?

05:43.847 --> 05:46.141
You know what really
impresses me about you?

05:46.183 --> 05:48.018
How little you try to impress me.

05:48.059 --> 05:51.062
Well, I aim to not please. (chuckles)

05:51.104 --> 05:54.608
I just came from a dinner
with this right-wing politician

05:54.650 --> 05:56.568
and his date, who was an actual hooker.

05:56.610 --> 05:58.987
Oh, my God, they sound
like terrible people.

05:59.029 --> 06:00.822
- Oh, they were.
- Huh.

06:00.864 --> 06:03.116
So, wait, is this where
you conceived Fakeblock?

06:03.158 --> 06:05.243
<i>It was George Michael's first chance</i>

06:05.285 --> 06:08.704
<i>to truly be unpretentious
and undo the big lie.</i>

06:08.746 --> 06:10.748
<i>On the other hand, she thought</i>

06:10.790 --> 06:13.293
<i>he was an unpretentious software genius.</i>

06:13.335 --> 06:17.464
<i>If she were to learn that he
was merely a wood block player</i>

06:17.506 --> 06:20.133
<i>with a heightened ability
to track the passage of time,</i>

06:20.175 --> 06:21.677
<i>perhaps she would rightly feel</i>

06:21.717 --> 06:24.513
<i>lack of pretention should be a given.</i>

06:24.555 --> 06:28.684
<i>It was after second 23 that he said... </i>

06:28.766 --> 06:31.687
24. Yes, it was, uh, right in here.

06:31.727 --> 06:33.313
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:33.355 --> 06:35.399
This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

06:35.440 --> 06:37.108
in their bicycle shop.

06:37.150 --> 06:39.027
<i>I'm sure she just meant one of them.</i>

06:39.069 --> 06:41.112
<i>Hey, how about her knowing
they had a bicycle shop?</i>

06:41.154 --> 06:42.864
Just a little token... 

06:42.906 --> 06:45.283
<i>The next morning, he walked her to her car.</i>

06:45.325 --> 06:48.579
(sighs) Listen, I got to go shoot a PSA.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.996
I'll text you from the car.

06:50.038 --> 06:51.915
Oh, no, don't... don't do... 

06:51.956 --> 06:53.458
- Action.
- Tweet and drive.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.835
Yeah, that was good, but it's "text."

06:55.877 --> 06:57.588
And we need the word "don't."

06:57.629 --> 06:59.590
<i>And upon returning to his dorm,</i>

06:59.631 --> 07:03.134
<i>he discovered that P-Hound had
officially filed a grievance</i>

07:03.176 --> 07:04.678
<i>with the student housing office.</i>

07:04.720 --> 07:07.055
DOUG: So P-Hound claims
that George Michael... 

07:07.097 --> 07:09.140
Make a note of that; that's one person.

07:09.182 --> 07:10.225
Oh, I know, I know.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.809
Messed with his stuff

07:11.851 --> 07:13.770
and stole some software thing?

07:13.811 --> 07:15.772
Yeah, and, uh, George Michael claims

07:15.813 --> 07:17.649
that nobody can live with P-Hound.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.443
Somebody's got to go.

07:19.484 --> 07:20.777
O... okay, it's time for a vote.

07:20.818 --> 07:22.446
We'll each get one vote.

07:22.487 --> 07:24.322
Oh, well, that doesn't really seem fair,

07:24.364 --> 07:26.116
because you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

07:26.157 --> 07:28.702
Oh, right, yeah, 'cause, uh, we're twins,

07:28.744 --> 07:31.079
and, uh, we have no sense
of ourselves as individuals.

07:31.121 --> 07:32.080
That's right.

07:32.122 --> 07:33.248
BOTH: Fine.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.125
We'll each get a half vote.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.210
<i>And the four men cast their three votes.</i>

07:37.252 --> 07:39.045
DOUG: It's a tie.

07:39.087 --> 07:41.506
Uh, one and a half to one and a half.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.425
<i>The twins were proud to show that they</i>

07:43.467 --> 07:44.926
<i>voted differently from one another.</i>

07:44.968 --> 07:48.012
Eh, we're gonna need a tiebreaker, ugly.

07:48.054 --> 07:50.181
<i>Fortunately, they were able to bring in</i>

07:50.223 --> 07:51.642
<i>two more half voters... </i>

07:51.683 --> 07:53.769
<i>- It's a tie. Two to two.
- ... who also proved</i>

07:53.810 --> 07:55.520
<i>they were capable of
having opposite opinions.</i>

07:55.562 --> 07:57.230
Double tie!

07:57.272 --> 07:58.898
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah! Whoo!

07:58.940 --> 08:00.942
<i>To break the tie, more members of twin club</i>

08:00.984 --> 08:02.235
<i>joined the electorate... </i>

08:02.277 --> 08:04.237
a quadruple tie!

08:04.279 --> 08:05.947
<i>Which also jammed up the works.</i>

08:05.989 --> 08:08.366
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Go, yeah.

08:08.408 --> 08:11.035
Maybe we should just bring
in a single person now.

08:11.077 --> 08:13.913
Uh, you mean like n... not a twin?

08:13.955 --> 08:15.332
Yeah, just to speed things along a little.

08:15.373 --> 08:17.083
<i>And perhaps it was that comment... </i>

08:17.125 --> 08:18.752
I guess one head's better
than two, huh? Twin hater.

08:18.794 --> 08:20.462
We've been dealing with
"twincists" like you

08:20.504 --> 08:22.714
all our lives.

08:22.756 --> 08:25.592
<i>That united the voting body
into a greater cause than</i>

08:25.634 --> 08:26.926

08:26.968 --> 08:29.095
<i>And with the exception</i>

08:29.137 --> 08:30.514
<i>of George Michael's vote... </i>

08:30.555 --> 08:31.973
P-Hound.

08:32.015 --> 08:35.352
George Michael. George
Michael. George Michael.

08:35.393 --> 08:36.520
George Michael. George Michael.

08:36.561 --> 08:38.895

08:41.232 --> 08:42.775
- I almost wrote that.
- (Laughs)

08:42.818 --> 08:44.068
<i>it was a George Michael blitz.</i>

08:44.110 --> 08:45.862
DOUG: (sighs) George Michael and... 

08:45.903 --> 08:48.948
oh, a half vote for "George
Michael the twincist."

08:48.990 --> 08:50.992
See you later, twin hater.

08:51.034 --> 08:52.369
- No, I'm not... 
- Uh, uh.

08:52.410 --> 08:54.663
(whispers): Shh. Go.

08:54.705 --> 08:57.081
<i>And now wishing he'd
actually packed the bag</i>

08:57.123 --> 08:59.543
<i>- I... 
- OTHERS: Shh.
- George Michael aimlessly</i>

08:59.584 --> 09:01.586
<i>headed out onto the campus
where, as fate would have it,</i>

09:01.628 --> 09:04.047
<i>- (horn honks) Oh!
- He ran into his beeping uncle.</i>

09:04.088 --> 09:05.423
(bleep) What are you doing here?

09:05.465 --> 09:07.175
I was in the neighborhood.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.636
I happened to remember
how much you love bologna.

09:09.678 --> 09:11.596
- Huh?
- So, yeah, I just... I found this great shop-rite

09:11.638 --> 09:13.348
and I just thought, you
know who's got to have

09:13.390 --> 09:15.517
a taste of this, is young George Michael.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.352
<i>He didn't think George
Michael liked bologna.</i>

09:17.394 --> 09:19.187
I know how you love bologna.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.981
<i>He was trying to correct
a bad impression he felt</i>

09:22.023 --> 09:24.651
<i>he might have made with his
nephew a few nights earlier.</i>

09:24.693 --> 09:25.736
We're good.

09:25.777 --> 09:27.404
My God, Uncle Gob, what is this?

09:27.445 --> 09:28.613
Can't lie to you, George Michael,

09:28.655 --> 09:29.906
it's a forget-me-now.

09:29.947 --> 09:32.868
I wanted you to forget what happened

09:32.909 --> 09:35.370
at that magic club; I was embarrassed.

09:35.412 --> 09:39.165
If you don't want me to tell
anyone about it, I won't.

09:39.207 --> 09:40.333
I'm such a fool.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.502
I go to those things too quickly.

09:42.544 --> 09:44.337
Really, it's just the
age we live in, isn't it?

09:44.379 --> 09:46.840
Take a pill to forget your problems.

09:46.882 --> 09:48.633
Take a pill to go to sleep.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.844
And take a pill to forget your problems.

09:50.886 --> 09:52.429
Need an erection, take a pill.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.097
Need to forget your problems, take a pill.

09:54.138 --> 09:56.307
Take a pill and your
problems are forgotten.

09:56.349 --> 09:57.392
Just take a pill.

09:57.434 --> 09:58.518
What an age we live in.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.728
It's great, isn't it? (laughs)

09:59.770 --> 10:02.272
What's with the suitcase?

10:02.313 --> 10:04.274
I got kicked out of my dorm.

10:04.315 --> 10:07.068
That was a freebie.

10:07.110 --> 10:08.695
You in the market to buy a house?

10:08.737 --> 10:10.196
It's a great time to buy.

10:10.238 --> 10:11.615
Oh, I don't want to buy a house.

10:11.656 --> 10:13.032
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Money?

10:13.074 --> 10:14.325
(chuckles): Ninja please.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.702
You don't need money.

10:15.744 --> 10:17.078
With that Fakeblock thing you got going

10:17.120 --> 10:18.329
and your great credit rating,

10:18.371 --> 10:19.956
we can put you in a Bluth in no time.

10:19.997 --> 10:22.375
<i>Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk</i>

10:22.417 --> 10:24.210
<i>George Michael would take.</i>

10:24.252 --> 10:27.046
<i>But then Gob said something
that changed his mind.</i>

10:27.088 --> 10:28.840
Plus, it would make your dad proud.

10:28.882 --> 10:31.468
I know that he's still
really disappointed about

10:31.509 --> 10:32.844
you, uh... 

10:32.886 --> 10:34.137
What, that I blew him off?

10:34.178 --> 10:35.931
Blew him off.

10:35.972 --> 10:37.974
Boy, is he disappointed about that.

10:38.015 --> 10:39.225
I would love to say yes... 

10:39.267 --> 10:40.184
Yes! There it is!

10:40.226 --> 10:42.353
I got my much vaunted yes!

10:42.395 --> 10:43.688
<i>Gob felt good.</i>

10:43.730 --> 10:45.482
<i>He would be able to prove</i>

10:45.523 --> 10:48.777
<i>to his brother that he
could actually sell a house.</i>

10:48.819 --> 10:51.070
<i>George Michael felt good
because he could prove</i>

10:51.112 --> 10:53.448
<i>to his father that he
did indeed support him.</i>

10:53.490 --> 10:56.534
<i>And the residents of
Sudden Valley felt good,</i>

10:56.576 --> 10:59.245
<i>because it turns out,
the very young-looking man</i>

10:59.287 --> 11:01.122
<i>- who drove down their street
- Hi.</i>

11:01.164 --> 11:03.249
<i>- That afternoon... 
- Oh, hello, young man.
- Hi.</i>

11:03.291 --> 11:04.793
How young are you?

11:04.835 --> 11:06.169
I'm good. How you doing?

11:06.210 --> 11:07.504
No, how young are you?

11:07.545 --> 11:09.631
Oh, I... I'm 22. 22 years... 

11:09.673 --> 11:11.132
<i>- ... was over 21,
- 22? You look 16.</i>

11:11.174 --> 11:12.634
<i>And they wouldn't have to search</i>

11:12.676 --> 11:14.344
<i>for a home that was even more remote.</i>

11:14.385 --> 11:18.306
He's 22! He's 22, but looks 16.

Thank you. Uh... Hi.
Hello again. Welcome back.

11:29.818 --> 11:31.695
Hi. Hi.

11:31.736 --> 11:33.488
Oh, it's so nice. Wow.

11:33.530 --> 11:34.948
Like it's my birthday.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.700
It's like it's everyone's birthday.

11:36.741 --> 11:38.075
Oh, this is... 

11:38.117 --> 11:40.578
(chuckles) I wonder who this is from.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.747
- We said no clothes, Carlos.
- Hat is not clothes.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.165
- A hat is clothes.
- Gosh, I wish

11:44.207 --> 11:45.792
I had something to offer you guys.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.377
You know, here you are, guests in my home,

11:47.418 --> 11:49.086
and you've gotten me these beautiful gifts.

11:49.128 --> 11:52.047
You know, feels like it
should be the other way around.

11:52.089 --> 11:53.424
(laughter)

11:53.466 --> 11:54.885
<i>MAN: Football!</i>

11:54.926 --> 11:56.469
Hut, hut.

- Carlos... 

11:57.846 --> 11:58.889
Carlos, you're on my team.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.181
You're on my team.

12:00.223 --> 12:02.017
The play is dead. The play is dead.

12:02.099 --> 12:03.977
The ball touched the ground.

12:04.019 --> 12:05.812
Come on. The play is dead.

12:05.854 --> 12:07.772
Carlos, man, we're on the same team.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.149
Guys, maybe-maybe we can't
play skins versus skins.

12:10.191 --> 12:11.609
Tops versus bottoms?

12:11.651 --> 12:13.319
I got to bring my girlfriend up here.

12:13.361 --> 12:14.821
- She's gonna love it.
- Let's throw her a party,

12:14.863 --> 12:16.948
Sudden Valley style.

12:18.575 --> 12:20.827
That actually sounds... Yeah, fun.

12:20.869 --> 12:23.955
<i>And so George Michael
was proud to invite Rebel</i>

12:23.997 --> 12:28.001
<i>to see how successful
George Maharis had become</i>

12:28.043 --> 12:30.294
<i>and how many people were
eager to be in his company.</i>

12:30.336 --> 12:33.214
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. He
was tickling me in there.

12:33.256 --> 12:35.592
- Hey, um, what... what is all this?
- Hey. Just a little surprise.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.010
<i>- You did this for me?
- Yes.
- But Rebel had</i>

12:37.052 --> 12:39.012
<i>- other concerns.
- We need to talk.</i>

12:39.054 --> 12:41.973
ALL: Ooh.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.182
This is it.

12:43.224 --> 12:44.851
This is the place.

12:44.893 --> 12:47.478
Hope you don't find it too pretentious.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.899
Well, what happened to the
old anything goes in the dorm?

12:50.941 --> 12:52.191
Well, I got this place instead.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.777
You know, I guess I wanted to impress you.

12:53.818 --> 12:55.737
I'm gonna get some furniture, obviously.

12:55.779 --> 12:57.655
- Right.
- The guys from home
fill are coming this week.

12:57.697 --> 12:59.114
That's not the problem.

12:59.156 --> 13:00.992
- No, that's not the problem.
- (Door opens)

13:01.868 --> 13:03.118
Wrong house, buddy.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.287
No, this is my son,

13:04.328 --> 13:05.747
Lem Depardieu.

13:05.789 --> 13:07.248
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

13:07.290 --> 13:08.750
Jacqueline still in the car?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.251
(exhales) Oh, you have a son?

13:10.293 --> 13:11.878
Yeah.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.671
- Hey, Lem. How you doing?
- Hi.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.048
I love kids. I'm great... 
You want a Twister?

13:15.090 --> 13:16.173
I was just given, like, four Twisters.

13:16.215 --> 13:17.759
- You should take one.
- Wow.

13:17.801 --> 13:19.719
- Go on, take a Twister.
- Oh. You know what, honey?

13:19.761 --> 13:22.513
Do you want to give Mommy some
alone time with her friend?

13:22.555 --> 13:25.058
Maybe he could go play in the pool.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.060
- Yeah.
- He'll be totally safe.
There's like 100 guys out there.

13:27.102 --> 13:28.227
- Yay!
- Make sure you wear your sunblock.

13:28.269 --> 13:29.604
<i>In fact, it was the folks</i>

13:29.646 --> 13:31.146
<i>in the pool who were more at risk</i>

13:31.188 --> 13:33.858
<i>of being near Lem than he was of them.</i>

13:40.031 --> 13:42.075
<i>And perhaps that's what led Gob</i>

13:42.117 --> 13:44.702
<i>to having to take out another ad.</i>

13:46.454 --> 13:47.914
GEORGE MICHAEL: Wow, what a great kid.

13:47.956 --> 13:49.332
You know, when I said I was

13:49.373 --> 13:50.959
not eager to have kids,

13:51.001 --> 13:53.086
but I think it's great that you have a son.

13:53.128 --> 13:54.838
You know, I have a spare room here

13:54.879 --> 13:56.255
that the two of you could stay in.

13:56.297 --> 13:57.674
Or maybe you could just stay in it.

13:57.715 --> 13:59.134
He doesn't live with me.

13:59.174 --> 14:01.136
He lives in France with his father.

14:01.176 --> 14:03.763
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season,

14:03.805 --> 14:05.598
but that's what I'm talking about.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.642
I just don't want to get that serious.

14:07.684 --> 14:09.560
Because you're seeing someone else?

14:09.602 --> 14:11.228
No. I mean, yes.

14:11.270 --> 14:12.856
I'm seeing someone else, but I don't want

14:12.897 --> 14:14.107
to get serious with him, either,

14:14.149 --> 14:15.692
and you're out telling people

14:15.733 --> 14:16.776
in the neighborhood

14:16.818 --> 14:18.111
that we're seeing each other.

14:18.153 --> 14:19.195
What happened to the guy

14:19.236 --> 14:20.571
who founded Fakeblock?

14:20.613 --> 14:21.948
The guy who keeps things anonymous?

14:21.990 --> 14:23.324
I can do anonymous.

14:23.366 --> 14:24.784
You know, I'm all about staying anonymous.

14:24.826 --> 14:26.703
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

14:26.744 --> 14:29.039
And then you're asking Lem
and me to move into this house,

14:29.080 --> 14:31.124
and it just, it seems all backwards.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.583
(sighs)

14:32.625 --> 14:34.127
Sorry.

14:34.169 --> 14:36.171
(door closes)

14:36.212 --> 14:38.297
Maybe it is backwards.

14:38.339 --> 14:41.134
<i>George Michael shared
his relationship problem</i>

14:41.176 --> 14:43.469
<i>with the one other woman</i>

14:43.511 --> 14:45.388
<i>he'd had a relationship problem with.</i>

14:45.429 --> 14:47.015
<i>GEORGE MICHAEL: Well, she's
not really my girlfriend.</i>

14:47.057 --> 14:49.100
I mean, I'm crazy about her,

14:49.142 --> 14:50.977
but she wants to keep things anonymous,

14:51.019 --> 14:52.937
- and I don't know how to do that.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.689
- Right.
- You haven't told her
your real name yet, have you?

14:54.731 --> 14:56.107
What? No, no.

14:56.149 --> 14:57.984
No, she still thinks I'm George Maharis,

14:58.026 --> 15:00.695
but she's dating another
guy, which is probably

15:00.737 --> 15:03.614
the whole reason she's always
saying I'm moving too fast.

15:03.656 --> 15:05.533
I take things too seriously.

15:05.575 --> 15:08.161
I take things too serious.

15:08.203 --> 15:09.537
I take things too seriously.

15:09.579 --> 15:10.872
I need to note which
one of those is correct,

15:10.914 --> 15:12.749
because I sound like a horse's ass

15:12.790 --> 15:14.667
when I alternate between the two of them.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.293
I need to get my (bleep) together.

15:16.335 --> 15:18.504
- Yeah.
- But the point is that I take things

15:18.546 --> 15:21.007
easily-breezily.

15:21.049 --> 15:22.926
Well, a real "serioush" woman

15:22.967 --> 15:25.595
knows what she wants and moves quickly.

15:25.636 --> 15:27.805
"Serioush" is nothing. That's not a word.

15:27.847 --> 15:29.265
Are you ready to see your office?

15:29.306 --> 15:30.433
I have been; it's great.

15:30.474 --> 15:31.684
I like it a lot. It... 

15:31.726 --> 15:33.644
I wonder if she's gonna think

15:33.686 --> 15:35.146
we've been a little lavish with money.

15:35.188 --> 15:36.439
You know, is it too much?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.481
But then to contradict myself,

15:37.523 --> 15:38.733
I do think at some point,

15:38.775 --> 15:40.568
it would be good to get a second chair

15:40.610 --> 15:42.112
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

15:42.153 --> 15:43.320
<i>Of course, that wasn't his office.</i>

15:43.362 --> 15:45.281
This isn't your office.

15:45.322 --> 15:47.033
She's over here.

15:47.075 --> 15:49.911
<i>And it was at his actual desk</i>

15:49.953 --> 15:52.622
<i>where he made his first
major decision as CEO.</i>

15:52.663 --> 15:56.167
- Maeby, you're fired!
- (Tires screech)

15:56.209 --> 15:57.460
<i>And although Mort was prepared</i>

15:57.501 --> 15:59.378
<i>to be handed his walking papers,</i>

15:59.420 --> 16:01.422
<i>there was nothing that could
have prepared George Michael</i>

16:01.464 --> 16:05.093
<i>for what Mort would leave on his desk.</i>

16:05.135 --> 16:06.928
<i>And so, later that day, Hey. Hey.</i>

16:06.970 --> 16:09.139
<i>It was a disgruntled Maeby
that ran into Michael-Hey.</i>

16:09.180 --> 16:11.682
<i>As he was seeking a
signature for his movie.</i>

16:11.724 --> 16:14.351
I think movies are dead.
Maybe it's a TV show.

16:14.393 --> 16:16.020
What? No. This girl that I'm dating, Rebel,

16:16.062 --> 16:18.397
she's gonna be in it,
and she would never do TV.

16:18.439 --> 16:20.483
You're dating Rebel Alley?

16:20.524 --> 16:24.070
Yeah. I have a picture of us
to prove it; I can't find it,

16:24.112 --> 16:25.696
- but yeah.
- So... 

16:25.738 --> 16:27.031
you're the other guy.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.532
You know her personally?

16:28.574 --> 16:29.993
Yes. I mean,

16:30.034 --> 16:31.911
that's how I know that you were dating her.

16:31.953 --> 16:33.955
Do you know the other
guy that she's dating?

16:33.997 --> 16:36.624
<i>And that's when she saw an opportunity</i>

16:36.666 --> 16:38.168
<i>to get back at George Michael.</i>

16:38.209 --> 16:40.170
No, no, but, um,

16:40.211 --> 16:41.462
I know it's over.

16:41.504 --> 16:42.797
She is dumping him.

16:42.839 --> 16:44.090
She dumping him?

16:44.132 --> 16:45.842
Apparently, he was coming on too strong,

16:45.883 --> 16:47.468
taking it too seriously.

16:47.510 --> 16:48.678
She hates that.

16:48.719 --> 16:50.054
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah,

16:50.096 --> 16:51.181
that's what she told me.

16:51.222 --> 16:52.389
Just kills it for her.

16:52.431 --> 16:53.766
She wants it easily-breezily.

16:53.808 --> 16:57.270
Well, that's... informative.

16:57.312 --> 16:59.189
I owe you. Thank you.

16:59.230 --> 17:00.397
No, you don't.

17:00.439 --> 17:01.816
Okay, wait,

17:01.858 --> 17:03.400
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just... 

17:03.442 --> 17:05.194
- Okay.
- One second.

17:05.236 --> 17:07.070
Mm-hmm.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.657
<i>And so fortified</i>

17:10.700 --> 17:12.827
<i>with Maeby's information that Rebel</i>

17:12.868 --> 17:14.704
<i>- was breaking up with her other beau... 
- Hello.</i>

17:14.744 --> 17:16.039
<i>- Michael.
- Michael decided</i>

17:16.079 --> 17:17.165
<i>- to move things along.
- I want you</i>

17:17.207 --> 17:18.582
to know that I think that

17:18.624 --> 17:19.916
I've been coming on a
little bit too strong.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.211
I got a lot going on; I got the movie.

17:21.252 --> 17:22.920
You know, a bunch of stuff

17:22.962 --> 17:24.797
with the housing complex, and I'm just... 

17:24.839 --> 17:26.049
I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.884
I want to just keep it easy-peasy.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.093
- Yeah.
- Cool, totally.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.636
- Keep it loose.
- Yeah.

17:30.678 --> 17:32.347
And we'll have some fun with, you know... 

17:32.388 --> 17:34.515
If the fun, you know... 

17:34.557 --> 17:36.684
Someday, one day, it gets more serious,

17:36.726 --> 17:39.187
you know, then, uh, then it does,

17:39.229 --> 17:40.646
and we, uh,

17:40.688 --> 17:43.233
we're walking down the
aisle, you know, and... 

17:43.274 --> 17:45.318
I'm saying it wrong, saying
it wrong, 'cause I get,

17:45.360 --> 17:47.195
uh, I get tongue-tied, um... 

17:47.237 --> 17:49.572
uh, because I think that you

17:49.613 --> 17:52.575
are coming on too strong.

17:52.616 --> 17:55.036
- You know? Bugging me.
- Oh, uh,

17:55.078 --> 17:56.495

17:56.537 --> 17:58.956
No.

17:58.998 --> 18:01.834

- Yeah? Yeah.

18:01.876 --> 18:04.295

18:04.337 --> 18:05.922
REBEL (sighs): That was great.

No.

18:12.136 --> 18:14.222
Uh, no.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.220
Well, you know, Gob told me that you wanted

19:36.262 --> 19:38.222
to start selling these
things, not just renting them,

19:38.264 --> 19:40.433

19:41.976 --> 19:43.478
That's... nice of him.

19:43.519 --> 19:45.229
How... how could you afford
one of these houses, buddy.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.814
Well, I have a lot of money coming in

19:46.856 --> 19:48.691
- from investors for my software thing... 
- Okay.

19:48.732 --> 19:51.152
And I don't know what's gonna
happen with that, so I thought

19:51.194 --> 19:53.154
I'd do what everyone around
here says: put it into Bluth.

19:53.196 --> 19:55.490
- Yeah, who else is saying that?
- You know, it's an expression.

19:55.531 --> 19:57.283
- Neighbors.
- I don't like it.

19:57.325 --> 19:58.493
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

19:58.534 --> 19:59.576
I just got two more boxes

19:59.618 --> 20:00.995
of Twister from the neighbors.

20:01.037 --> 20:02.913
- Oh, boy, return them.
- Feel like I have one

20:02.955 --> 20:05.333
for every day of the week now.
Anyway, you know, I figure that

20:05.375 --> 20:07.293
worse case scenario is I
sell this place, and I get

20:07.335 --> 20:08.794
my money back. It's not like

20:08.836 --> 20:10.254
- they're going down in value, right?
- Well... 

20:10.296 --> 20:11.881
It's a great community.

20:11.922 --> 20:13.508
- Nobody locks their doors around here.
- You should.

20:13.549 --> 20:15.968
Plus, I... I wanted to make it up to you.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.636
You know, I felt terrible

20:17.678 --> 20:19.972
about what happened with the dorm and... 

20:20.014 --> 20:21.598
- Wow.
- And things between us.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.394
And I... I've screwed up a lot of things

20:24.435 --> 20:26.270
in the past few weeks,

20:26.312 --> 20:28.564
and, you know, this is the one thing

20:28.605 --> 20:30.816
that I know I did right.

20:30.858 --> 20:33.361
I mean, who would not want
to raise their kids here?

20:33.403 --> 20:36.280

Thank you.

20:39.492 --> 20:43.371

need to do it for me, pal.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.748
<i>Now he just needed to get
out of the house before... </i>

20:45.789 --> 20:48.251
You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

20:48.292 --> 20:50.211
- Yeah?
- I also did it for my girlfriend.

20:50.253 --> 20:51.628
Kind of wanted to impress her.

20:51.670 --> 20:54.424
<i>That came up.</i>

20:54.465 --> 20:56.384
Wow.

20:56.426 --> 20:57.552
You got a girlfriend.

20:57.593 --> 20:59.429
Good for you. That's great.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.180
Congratulations.

- Yep.

How is yours going?

21:05.184 --> 21:08.479
Not great.

21:08.521 --> 21:10.689
I haven't been completely honest with her

21:10.731 --> 21:13.025

21:13.067 --> 21:15.694
You know, I haven't even
told her my real name,

21:15.736 --> 21:16.946

21:16.987 --> 21:19.574
I can keep that lie going, so... 

21:19.615 --> 21:21.534

21:43.347 --> 21:45.433
I'm sorry.

21:45.475 --> 21:48.311
<i>And that's when Michael finally
treated his son like an adult.</i>

21:48.352 --> 21:50.563

21:50.605 --> 21:52.689
The mustache.

21:52.731 --> 21:55.318

21:55.359 --> 21:59.489
<i>to his apartment, only to find worse news.</i>

21:59.530 --> 22:01.616
<i>And when he saw that Lucille 2</i>

22:01.657 --> 22:04.285
<i>was having a campaign event at Cinco,</i>

22:04.327 --> 22:07.079
<i>he knew there was only
one thing he could give her</i>

22:07.121 --> 22:08.539
<i>instead of the money.</i>

22:08.581 --> 22:11.417
<i>And he knew what he had to do first</i>

22:11.459 --> 22:13.794
<i>to give it to her.</i>

22:13.836 --> 22:17.214
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
had a keynote speech to give,</i>

22:17.256 --> 22:20.510
<i>and hadn't totally decided

22:20.551 --> 22:22.386
<i>And that's when he ran into his uncle.</i>

22:22.428 --> 22:23.471
We'll take care of.

22:23.513 --> 22:25.055

- No, it's George Michael.

22:28.601 --> 22:30.603
- Hi. Exactly.
- Yes.

22:30.645 --> 22:32.396
Hey, I'm actually really
glad I ran into you.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.523
I could use some advice.

22:33.564 --> 22:35.149
Oh. Love each other.

22:35.191 --> 22:37.067
Oh, no, that's great, but I actually need

22:37.109 --> 22:39.694
a specific piece of advice
for a certain situation.

22:39.736 --> 22:41.572
I'll give it to you fast.

22:41.614 --> 22:45.535
Basically, for the past few
weeks, I've been living a lie.
