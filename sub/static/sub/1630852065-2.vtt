11:44.506 --> 11:46.923
Sweet. Lava bomb, great idea.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.340
-Hey, emulick, catch!
-No, no! Don't draw its attention!

11:56.381 --> 11:58.423
-[continues roaring]
-[Nomi] Ooh.

11:59.256 --> 12:00.840
Good catch.

12:03.881 --> 12:04.881
[grunts]

12:05.423 --> 12:08.256
Oh! My baked goods! [panicking] No!

12:08.340 --> 12:10.256
Well, I'm glad you filled your pockets
with pastries

12:10.340 --> 12:12.256
instead of, you know, weapons.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.756
Hey, pastries can solve anything.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.631
[gasps] That's it!

12:17.965 --> 12:19.715
[continues grunting]

12:32.923 --> 12:34.548
[laughs]

12:34.631 --> 12:36.881
You'll never get in here, lava face!

12:39.256 --> 12:42.173
Ah! I take it back! I take it back!

12:42.340 --> 12:44.673
Hey! Emulick! Over here!

12:44.756 --> 12:47.590
-Over-- Whoa! [whimpers]
-[roars]

12:47.673 --> 12:49.090
[Captain Garbage] Hey, emulick!

12:53.298 --> 12:56.465
You know what they say,
"You are what you eat!"

13:05.256 --> 13:06.298
[slurps]

13:06.381 --> 13:09.048
[all chewing, munching]

13:11.048 --> 13:12.715
-[slurping]
-Ed? No.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.465
Ed? No.

13:15.548 --> 13:17.215
Oh, he could be anyone. Or no one.

13:17.298 --> 13:18.590
-I'll never find...
-[shutter clicks]

13:23.131 --> 13:25.715
[gasps] What are you doing?

13:25.798 --> 13:28.215
Fake IDs. Now, if you'll excuse me.

13:28.298 --> 13:30.090
Enough! Take it off.

13:30.173 --> 13:32.756
How dare you lay your paws
on a Council member!

13:32.840 --> 13:34.506
[growling, grunting]

13:35.048 --> 13:37.965
Loaf, I demand a... What the! Who am I?

13:38.048 --> 13:41.090
-I mean, who are you?
-Um. I'm Happy,

13:41.173 --> 13:43.465
weird smelling Captain of the Venus.

13:43.548 --> 13:45.798
Guards, arrest this ugly impostor!

13:46.465 --> 13:48.215
[collar crackles]

13:48.298 --> 13:51.256
I got him. Garbage has snuck off
the M-Bark, hasn't he?

13:51.340 --> 13:53.173
I hope you two enjoyed
your crew suspension

13:53.256 --> 13:55.048
because it's about to become permanent.

13:55.131 --> 13:57.340
-Emergency Council meeting!
-Oh, no,

13:57.423 --> 13:59.881
this is worse than my worst case scenario,

13:59.965 --> 14:02.298
and I'm really good
at worst case scenarios!

14:02.381 --> 14:05.590
Well, all good things
must come to an end, right, buddy?

14:07.673 --> 14:09.506
-I need to lie down.
-[thud]

14:12.840 --> 14:14.673
My hut's just past that cliff.

14:14.756 --> 14:16.548
Kira, you're badly hurt.

14:16.631 --> 14:18.173
We need to take you back to the M-Bark.

14:18.256 --> 14:20.423
-[nervously] What? No.
-[squishes]

14:20.506 --> 14:25.215
I'm fine. Just hover over my hut and
I'll jump out on my three working limbs.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.590
Please don't go, Kira.

14:26.673 --> 14:29.423
We can fix your arm
in a couple days on the M-Bark.

14:29.506 --> 14:32.881
-Here, it'll take months.
-Let it take months.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.715
Kira, I get why you don't trust humans,

14:35.798 --> 14:37.715
but I'm not asking you to trust them.

14:37.798 --> 14:40.548
I'm asking you to trust dogs.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.381
I know you haven't had someone
watch your tail for a long time,

14:45.465 --> 14:47.465
but dogs look out for each other.

14:48.465 --> 14:49.756
Please?

14:52.923 --> 14:57.548
Well, I suppose I could stock up
on those pastries while I'm there.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.090
Yes!

15:12.131 --> 15:13.756
Kira, stay here and hide.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.923
We'll get medical supplies
and come straight back...

15:16.006 --> 15:18.673
[gasps] Hey, Happy!

15:18.756 --> 15:22.215
And Duchess! Hi.

15:22.298 --> 15:23.506
Pastry?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.756
So to recap, you ignored the Council,

15:27.840 --> 15:31.590
went on an unauthorized mission
to an unidentified planet

15:31.673 --> 15:34.298
and risked the lives of your entire team?

15:34.381 --> 15:36.090
Not my entire team.

15:36.173 --> 15:38.590
You're a liability
to this mission, Garbage.

15:38.673 --> 15:40.631
[sigh] Captain,

15:40.715 --> 15:43.006
-we have no choice but to strip you of--
-[door opening]

15:43.090 --> 15:45.381
[Kira] Captain Garbage is a hero!

15:47.423 --> 15:50.173
-[gasps] How can this be?
-What the heck!

15:50.256 --> 15:52.673
Who not on Earth are you?

15:52.756 --> 15:54.173
My name is Kira.

15:54.256 --> 15:56.506
[in despair] P.R.A.T.S.
sent me from Earth, just like you.

15:56.590 --> 15:59.298
I was stranded on that planet for years.

15:59.381 --> 16:02.090
Helpless, struggling to survive.

16:02.173 --> 16:04.548
Struggling? Helpless? What are you talk...

16:05.756 --> 16:08.673
-P.R.A.T.S. sent you?
-A dog in space?

16:08.756 --> 16:10.048
[chuckles] This is unbelievable.

16:10.131 --> 16:13.340
I'm finding nothing of your existence
in the data bank.

16:13.423 --> 16:15.715
Forgotten, forsaken!

16:15.798 --> 16:19.298
If it weren't for the Pluto
swooping in to rescue me from the

16:19.381 --> 16:21.465
hundreds of monsters that live there,

16:21.548 --> 16:24.006
I would have been eaten alive,

16:24.090 --> 16:27.048
but Garbage saved me. [groans]

16:28.423 --> 16:31.715
-Why are you doing this?
-Dogs look out for each other, right?

16:33.006 --> 16:34.423
Don't fall for this nonsense.

16:34.506 --> 16:36.506
I-I bet this is
just another holo-disguise.

16:37.131 --> 16:38.548
-[growls]
-[yelps]

16:39.131 --> 16:43.215
The Council of Canines
cannot overlook saving the life of a dog.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.923
Yes, you can. Overlook it. Overlook it!

16:46.006 --> 16:48.590
Captain Happy, stand down.

16:48.673 --> 16:51.173
-Ow!
-This is truly remarkable.

16:51.256 --> 16:53.965
Kira, we welcome you to the M-Bark.

16:54.048 --> 16:57.631
Nevertheless, we have
a serious situation to resolve.

16:57.715 --> 16:58.756
[sighs]

16:58.840 --> 17:01.090
Garbage, I hate to do this,

17:01.173 --> 17:02.840
but we're sending you to...

17:02.923 --> 17:04.798
[dramatically] Penelope.

17:06.965 --> 17:09.006
Who's Penelope?

17:14.048 --> 17:15.798
The dog trainer.

17:16.548 --> 17:18.798
♪ Somebody else! ♪

17:18.881 --> 17:22.715
♪ It feels good being somebody else ♪

17:22.798 --> 17:26.506
♪ Don't get me wrong
I love being myself ♪

17:26.590 --> 17:30.340
