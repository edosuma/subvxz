00:05.967 --> 00:09.067
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:09.100 --> 00:12.967
the spring runoff is
creating chaos across Alaska.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.900
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
Nature does decide for you.

00:14.933 --> 00:16.800
ANDY BASSICH:
Something catastrophic
can happen.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.300
SUE AIKENS:
You want to live out here?
Just deal with shit.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.433
NARRATOR:
Sue's business is under water.

00:22.467 --> 00:26.133
SUE: This is my runway.
100% out of commission.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.567
NARRATOR:
Glenn's water supply
is at risk.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.800
GLENN: I'm not too crazy
about drinking that water.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.700
NARRATOR:
The Hailstone clan struggles

00:33.733 --> 00:35.400
to keep
their heads above water.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.233
CHIP: They're having
motor problems.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.267
NARRATOR: And Andy and Kate
could see a lifelong dream

00:39.300 --> 00:42.300
plunge into a watery grave.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.233
ANDY: Tell me what the
fuck is going on.

00:44.267 --> 00:45.867
'Cause I can't see
a fuckin' thing.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.333
Hey, Roger, how's it going?

01:04.367 --> 01:08.033
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens
is now the sole proprietor
of Kavik River Camp.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.667
I'm no longer
somebody else's bitch.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.400
I'm my own owner.
I run my own business.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.667
NARRATOR: To make money,
she has to keep
her runway open

01:14.700 --> 01:16.167
during the busy summer months

01:16.200 --> 01:18.600
when the camp serves
as a remote outpost

01:18.633 --> 01:21.100
for scientists, hunters
and bush pilots.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.133
With the new pressures
of being owner,

01:24.167 --> 01:25.867
Sue has brought on
a helping hand

01:25.900 --> 01:28.467
to assist with the drastically
increased summer workload.

01:30.533 --> 01:33.000
SUE: I have a family member
whose name is Rick

01:33.033 --> 01:36.567
and I brought him up here
and he wants to help out.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.733
I just wanted to tell you
I appreciate you coming out.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.100
No problem, Sue.
I love it up here.

01:41.133 --> 01:44.000
I know we're both...
We're not over the hill,

01:44.033 --> 01:45.867
but we're looking at it
from the summit.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.300
(RICK SPEAKING)

01:47.333 --> 01:50.833
He's a real good guy.
I mean, he was 15 years
A&P mechanic,

01:50.867 --> 01:53.367
a pilot and helicopter
mechanic in the Navy.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.600
He's just got a lot of
hands on experience,
a lot of knowledge,

01:55.633 --> 01:56.933
and that's something
I need here.

01:56.967 --> 01:59.733
Your help is pretty valuable.
You got a lot of talent there.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.100
I got a minion
and I'm going to use him.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.233
If I do something
that bugs the hell out of you,

02:05.267 --> 02:06.767
(LAUGHING) too bad.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.067
(RICK SPEAKING)

02:14.567 --> 02:18.167
SUE: Holy shit!
Welcome to the thaw.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.000
NARRATOR: Sue's camp sits in
an unpredictable flood plain

02:21.033 --> 02:22.567
since the flat tundra
does little

02:22.600 --> 02:25.433
to hold the river at bay
during the run off.

02:25.467 --> 02:29.867
Unfortunately,
the runway is dangerously
close to flooding waters.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.700
SUE: It is coming up.
I see where
it's coming up over

02:31.733 --> 02:33.200
-the bank area here.
-RICK: Yeah.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.567
The water is stagnant,
stationary here

02:36.600 --> 02:39.367
so it's obviously
water-logged the ground.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.900
The river is coming up,
everything is melting.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.800
You know,
it's 24-hour daylight,
it's 50 degrees right now.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.533
It's gonna be 50 degrees until
the weather pattern changes.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.433
There is no sunset.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.167
Because it happens so late
and so much snow,

02:52.200 --> 02:55.133
I mean, you never get to know
exactly when
it's going to hit.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.633
Bam! Here it is.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.967
NARRATOR:
Sue will have to keep her eye
on the rising waters,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.567
but for now she has
other pressing matters.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.033
(SUE SPEAKING)

03:09.300 --> 03:11.400
NARRATOR:
Kavik River Camp
is 60 miles away

03:11.433 --> 03:15.633
from one of Alaska's
most remote highways,
which ends in Deadhorse.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.133
SUE:
I got two loads yesterday.
I got three to four for today.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.967
Boom, boom, boom.
I got to get going.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.700
NARRATOR:
Every supply must be flown in
by bush plane.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.567
SUE: Yo, Bob-O.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.533
I've been up here a long time
without any help
and I like it that way.

03:34.567 --> 03:37.833
But does Rick
provide companionship?
Absolutely.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.567
Holy shit.

03:40.633 --> 03:41.800
Can you give me
a fuckin' hand?

03:41.833 --> 03:44.367
-Well, I thought you...
(LAUGHS)
-Grab her.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.333
I'm here pooping myself.

03:46.367 --> 03:50.633
But for me the blessing is
it's a very finite,
limited engagement.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.900
-Is that it?
-(BOB GILL SPEAKING)

03:52.933 --> 03:54.333
You want more stuff today?

03:54.367 --> 03:56.333
I might as well.
What do you got coming next?

04:01.033 --> 04:03.433
-All right, buddy.
-BOB: Okay.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.667
Good as always. Fly safe.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.133
NARRATOR:
In the short time it took
to unload the plane,

04:14.167 --> 04:17.900
over two feet of water
has made its way
onto the runway.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.700
SUE: The runway is how
people get in and out.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.267
It's how supplies
get in and out.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.100
It's how fuel
gets in and out.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.967
The runway is life out here.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.567
With this warm temperature,
everything melts out so fast,

04:29.600 --> 04:32.800
the water table comes up
and... And you're done.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.767
(ANIMALS HOWLING)

04:36.800 --> 04:39.233
GLENN: This whole business
about living by killing
and eating things

04:39.267 --> 04:40.767
makes a lot of people
uncomfortable.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.300
A lot of people
have a problem with it.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.500
But I don't think there's
any way to really escape it.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.467
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
lives without electricity.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.033
He has no way
to store fresh meat.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.333
Each day is a vital quest
for food.

04:59.367 --> 05:02.133
Just a few days ago
I was still hunting caribou.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.300
(WHOOPING)

05:08.233 --> 05:09.600
(EXHALES)

05:10.433 --> 05:11.667
(FIRING)

05:16.333 --> 05:18.000
Both shots missed.

05:18.033 --> 05:21.400
Things have changed
and I'm not going
after caribou any more.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.067
It's getting too late
in the season.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.600
There's a lot more flies out
just in the last few days

05:25.633 --> 05:28.100
and the lake is all
covered in water

05:28.133 --> 05:32.000
so I'm just going
to be concentrating on
getting smaller animals now

05:32.033 --> 05:35.033
like porcupine...
Duck should be coming soon,

05:35.067 --> 05:36.767
there's some squirrels around.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.100
So I'm gonna be hunting
those kind of animals now.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.400
There are flies out,
all right.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.900
That's some scraps
I had to throw out
this morning.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.233
(FLIES BUZZING)

05:50.267 --> 05:52.933
When things warm up
at this time of year,
the flies start coming out.

05:52.967 --> 05:57.033
They go all over the meat
and they lay eggs on meat.

05:57.067 --> 06:00.533
The eggs hatch little maggots,
ruin the meat.
You can't eat it.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.200
(BUZZING)

06:12.600 --> 06:13.700
Hey, look!

06:15.100 --> 06:17.133
I shoot squirrels
for one reason:

06:17.167 --> 06:18.733
because they chew
on things around here.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.000
They cause a lot of damage.

06:20.033 --> 06:23.867
They'll chew up the tent
or they'll get into
my caribou hides,

06:23.900 --> 06:25.167
but I also eat them.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.467
There he is.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.800
(COCKS GUN)

06:34.800 --> 06:36.033
(FIRES GUN)

06:42.633 --> 06:44.433
A little red squirrel.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.533
I like to eat
all the different animals
out here.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.133
I like to eat red squirrels
once in a while.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.467
It's been a couple of months
since I ate one.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.633
This one is pretty messed up
by shooting it.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.533
You see... I'm just
going to get the legs.

07:04.133 --> 07:07.400
Just a little variety.
Squirrel legs.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.767
It's a lot more
than just the flavour
of the food,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.233
although that is important.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.833
It's a lot more
than the nutrition
of the food,

07:15.867 --> 07:19.567
although I think
the nutrition of this food
is unsurpassed.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.600
But it has to do
with the relationship
to the food.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.867
I just don't feel the same
if I go in the store

07:24.900 --> 07:28.867
and buy some food
that got grown
2,000 miles away,

07:28.900 --> 07:31.433
processed by some company
that's got some executives

07:31.467 --> 07:36.533
getting rich up in a penthouse
in New York City
selling it to me.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.533
I just feel a lot better
eating this food out here.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.300
(HOWLING)

07:43.333 --> 07:46.433
ANDY: It's not that I don't
want to be a part of the
rest of the world.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.700
But I gain a great deal
of satisfaction

07:48.733 --> 07:51.667
from being able to do things
for myself and by myself.

08:01.633 --> 08:06.367
I'm gonna try
and go get my sawmill
up in Eagle today.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.533
NARRATOR: This spring,
Andy Bassich has big plans

08:08.567 --> 08:10.600
to build additions
to his remote homestead

08:10.633 --> 08:13.300
using a sawmill
he purchased in the winter.

08:15.467 --> 08:18.533
To get it home
he had to travel
a thousand miles round trip

08:18.567 --> 08:20.000
from Eagle to Anchorage,

08:20.033 --> 08:23.133
160 done over treacherous
mountain roads.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.900
You gotta be careful, if
you go too far off to one side

08:25.933 --> 08:27.400
you'll just fall off the road.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.867
-Kind of muddy.
-Yes, it is.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.167
NARRATOR: The thaw
is the only time
that Andy will be able

08:34.200 --> 08:36.767
to utilise the sawmill to
build his additions.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.333
Once winter arrives,
it will be useless.

08:39.367 --> 08:42.533
The sawmill probably weighs
I think around 3,700 pounds,

08:42.567 --> 08:44.433
so approximately two tonnes.

08:44.467 --> 08:48.567
I've configured my two boats
into a big pontoon

08:48.600 --> 08:51.533
and I'm just creating
a much more stable platform.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.800
We're just going
to take our time and try
and do everything right

08:54.833 --> 08:56.567
and not get in too much
of a hurry.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.800
There you go.
Now, turn the throttle.

09:02.533 --> 09:03.533
More!

09:08.800 --> 09:10.567
I'm surprised
there's still ice
on the shore.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.500
That says a lot about
how bad break-up was,
but it's melting fast.

09:16.667 --> 09:20.600
Twenty-four hours of sunlight
does a lot of melting
real quick on this ice.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.200
The plan is to bring this up
into the landing.

09:25.233 --> 09:29.467
I'll probably sling
the sawmill and set it on
those big heavy beams.

09:29.500 --> 09:33.600
If I tried to bring
the sawmill down on one boat
it would be very tippy.

09:33.633 --> 09:35.467
But by putting
two boats together,

09:35.500 --> 09:38.267
then it's stable this way
and it's stable this way.

09:38.300 --> 09:43.300
So, this is the most stable
platform I can build for
a heavy load that's long.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.000
And it's all about stability
when you are out on the river.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.433
The worst thing
that could happen

09:49.467 --> 09:51.367
is that the sawmill
could go into the river

09:51.400 --> 09:53.333
and if it does that
then it's a loss.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.600
So I'm kind of
on pins and needles.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.433
CHIP: It is a different way
of living.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.833
There's so many ways
to be wealthy here
without money. It's crazy.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.167
You know,
I chose a different life.
A whole different lifestyle.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.667
(RATTLING)

10:13.567 --> 10:16.467
CHIP: We are getting ready
to take kids down to
our camp fishing trap.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.400
NARRATOR: The Hailstone clan
spends most of the summer

10:18.433 --> 10:22.767
travelling hundreds of
miles of river
in their quest for food.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.033
Everything they catch
will be sold, traded
or consumed

10:26.067 --> 10:27.500
over the next several months.

10:27.533 --> 10:29.100
(GRUNTING)

10:29.133 --> 10:31.467
And the oldest son
is going to join us.
He's working his way home.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.033
'Cause he's got
his own gear down there.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.400
All right.
I'll see you guys down there.

10:37.433 --> 10:39.200
I'm not going to ride down.
It's full.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.433
We just saddled up our house.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.967
We just got all of our kids
all saddled up
and ready to go.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.433
Before you load anything,
we need to move the boat out.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.900
Basically we've just got
a window of a few days

10:52.933 --> 10:56.867
to get the vast majority
of the fish that are coming
out of the lakes.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.667
I've done this
for 20-some odd years,

10:58.700 --> 11:01.567
I'm feeling good about today.
So we'll see what happens.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.933
NARRATOR:
Chip will pilot one boat

11:03.967 --> 11:07.633
while eldest daughter,
Tinmiaq, navigates the other.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.767
CHIP: Kids! Get in the boat.
We do this every year.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.733
We do it in different places
but this is one of the most
enjoyable fishing trips

11:14.767 --> 11:18.867
because I get to be with
the kids after a long winter
of having kids in school.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.333
Well, motor's warm.
What do you think?

11:20.367 --> 11:21.500
You ready for camp?

11:21.533 --> 11:22.733
(KID SPEAKING)

11:24.333 --> 11:25.400
GIRL: Ready!

11:25.433 --> 11:27.067
-CHIP: They'll catch us.
-Bye.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.400
CHIP: The kids
are going to learn a lot.
There's no doubt about that.

11:32.433 --> 11:36.633
They'll participate a lot
and that's really what we want
more than anything else.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.000
Just to be with the kids.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.833
(MOTOR STALLS)

11:41.867 --> 11:44.600
NARRATOR:
Suddenly Tinmiaq's motor dies.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.300
Boats are the
family's lifeline.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.300
If Tin doesn't get
the motor running,

11:58.333 --> 12:00.833
this trip could be over
before it begins.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.600
CHIP:
They're having motor problems!

12:21.633 --> 12:25.833
NARRATOR: The Hailstone clan
is on one of the biggest
fishing trips of the year.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.567
But it's off to a rough start

12:27.600 --> 12:30.533
as a problematic motor strands
two of Chip's daughters.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.467
-Are you overheating?
-(TINMIAQ REPLYING)

12:42.500 --> 12:44.400
Is it just shutting off
on its own?

12:47.633 --> 12:48.967
Pull the choke
all the way out.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.767
I know my daughter
was having motor problems

12:50.800 --> 12:54.567
and she's not a mechanic
so she's not understanding
what the problem is.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.633
Turn up your throttle.
Turn up your throttle,
give it a try.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.833
So, we don't have
a fuel problem.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.500
I'm hoping we don't
have water in the fuel.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.500
I don't see any water at all
inside the filter here.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.433
So I don't really think
that's going to be
a problem either.

13:14.467 --> 13:18.767
I just added some more
four-stroke oil in case this
one was a little low.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.533
These things have
an electronic shut-off

13:20.567 --> 13:23.667
so if you're low on oil
or it's overheating,
it just shuts the engine down.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.767
Try giving it a pull.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.033
(MOTOR STARTS)

13:28.067 --> 13:30.233
Put it back to that rev,
leave it like that.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.400
Let go of...
Let it go like that.
Now put your lid back on.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.967
Just go! You're going
to have stay ahead of me.

13:43.433 --> 13:47.033
Anytime you got motor problems
you only go as fast
as the slowest person.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.767
Start taking things
to the cabin, babe.

13:59.433 --> 14:00.933
Nice ride.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.900
Had some motor problems
coming back

14:02.933 --> 14:05.367
and that was really giving
people a bad attitude, so...

14:05.400 --> 14:07.733
You can yell at a motor
all you want, it don't care.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.733
It was out of the oil,
I guess. 'Cause after that,
it was perfect.

14:14.033 --> 14:16.700
(CHUCKLES)
Single guys
are so lucky sometimes.

14:16.733 --> 14:19.067
Today's work
is to get down further.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.933
We're going to go
put that net in
so it's producing tonight.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.400
And then tomorrow
we go check it.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.700
That's all we really
have to do today,
is just get down to the net...

14:25.733 --> 14:27.900
-Set it.
-...set the net
and then call it good.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.400
GLENN: I think the people
in the modern world,

14:31.433 --> 14:34.400
they try to escape
this endless cycle
of life and death.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.167
I don't want
to escape from that.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.800
It's a part of my life
every day.

14:47.367 --> 14:50.833
I'm going to see if I can
go out and get some water
out of my ice hole.

14:50.867 --> 14:53.733
Because I keep water
in these buckets in here
but they're both empty,

14:53.767 --> 14:56.033
so I need to get
some water now.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.600
NARRATOR: In addition
to gathering
all the food he eats,

14:58.633 --> 15:01.600
Glenn is constantly in need
of safe drinking water.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.467
Right at this point
where the slush
changes colour,

15:06.500 --> 15:10.600
that's where the ice
is frozen right to the
bottom of the lake.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.500
Not long ago I came out here
and I put in this hole

15:20.533 --> 15:23.033
in order to get water
from the lake.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.333
I chiselled a big hole down
through four feet of ice

15:31.800 --> 15:34.167
and there was
really nice clean water.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.167
You could stand here
on the ice and
it was completely dry.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.600
Now, there's three or four
inches of water running
across the top of the ice.

15:41.633 --> 15:44.033
It's going down that hole
as if it's a drain.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.267
Well, all this overflow
from the snow
melting on the mountains

15:49.300 --> 15:52.733
has been coming down
the last couple of days

15:52.767 --> 15:54.667
and running
right into my water hole.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.367
I'm not too crazy
about drinking that water

15:57.400 --> 16:00.667
because there's wolf shit
all over this lake.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.567
NARRATOR: This winter Glenn
shared the lake with a group
of aggressive carnivores.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.900
GLENN: That is
a pack of 20 wolves

16:06.933 --> 16:08.933
on a big animal
they just took down.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.133
This is the biggest
pack of wolves
I have ever seen.

16:11.167 --> 16:15.767
So I decided to run back
and forth to attract
their attention.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.400
Last time
when I'm running back,

16:17.433 --> 16:19.633
I see all the wolves
racing towards me.

16:19.667 --> 16:23.533
I never had wolves come
running towards me before.
Never.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.033
And I start shooting.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!

16:26.933 --> 16:28.667
And I hit three wolves.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.367
All of the other wolves,
they had run off.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.800
So I started running
across the lake

16:33.833 --> 16:38.367
and I'm running over
towards the kill site.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.767
That's what I saw what it was.
They had killed a moose.
Took a look at that.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.567
Then I decided I better get
picking up these wolves

16:44.600 --> 16:46.000
and start skinning
some wolves.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.867
NARRATOR: For now,
the pack is keeping
its distance

16:48.900 --> 16:52.733
but the scat left behind
has contaminated
his water supply.

16:52.767 --> 16:56.733
Wolves around here
have a parasite called an
Echinococcus granulosus

16:56.767 --> 17:00.467
and the eggs of the parasite
are in the
wolves' droppings.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.533
If you ingest those,
you can get really sick.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.833
(WOLF HOWLING)

17:05.867 --> 17:07.433
And I'm a little concerned
about it

17:07.467 --> 17:09.767
because I've had
wolves defecating all over
the lake this winter.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.500
There were 20 wolves
right here

17:11.533 --> 17:13.933
and before this snow
started melting,

17:13.967 --> 17:17.800
you could walk around here
and see wolf droppings
all over on top of the snow.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.767
So I really don't
have much appetite
to drink that water.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.067
I was planning
on using this water hole
a little bit longer.

17:23.100 --> 17:27.767
I didn't know it was
going to fill up like this
so fast with overflow,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.433
but that's just
the way it goes.

17:29.467 --> 17:32.867
Out here, the environment
changes really quickly,
especially in the spring time.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.433
Things change and
you have to adjust.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
Whatever happens,
you can cope with it

17:39.233 --> 17:43.433
if you are flexible
and you adjust
to the situation.

17:43.467 --> 17:46.900
But you always
have to be on your toes
and make adjustments

17:46.933 --> 17:48.433
and take advantage
of what's going on.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.467
You can actually
use a lot of these changes
to your advantage.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.633
Right now, for example,
I can't get water out of there
like I used to,

17:53.667 --> 17:56.900
but because it's spring time,
there will be other things
I can do.

17:56.933 --> 17:59.533
Like, pretty soon there will
be ducks coming in
to land in this water

17:59.567 --> 18:00.900
and I can hunt those ducks.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.067
You just to have
to go with the flow

18:04.100 --> 18:06.667
and you have
to let nature decide

18:06.700 --> 18:08.533
about how you want
to do things out here.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.333
I mean,
nature does decide for you.

18:12.367 --> 18:15.067
You just can't be rigid
about things.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.300
So I gotta go look for water
someplace else.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.767
ANDY: I've never been afraid
to just dive into something.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.600
I've often said,
"The best way to learn
is to make a mistake."

18:27.633 --> 18:29.467
And I've learned a lot.

18:34.033 --> 18:35.567
NARRATOR:
Andy is attempting
to transport

18:35.600 --> 18:38.500
a two-tonne sawmill
to his remote homestead.

18:38.533 --> 18:43.067
He's using a sky lift
to load the machine onto
an improvised pontoon.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.033
ANDY: This has been
about an eight-month project
in the works

18:46.067 --> 18:50.333
as far as
tracking the mill down,
purchasing it,

18:50.367 --> 18:54.567
getting it to Eagle
and now getting it down
to Calico.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
I've got some slings
made up right here

18:57.633 --> 19:00.700
and what I hope to do
is pick it up
with the sky lift here.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.433
I'm going to take it down

19:06.467 --> 19:11.500
and try and set it right
on the boats that I have
set up as a catamaran.

19:11.533 --> 19:16.200
KATE: Getting the sawmill down
to Calico is pretty much
a delicate operation here

19:16.233 --> 19:18.700
and it's fairly
time-sensitive.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.667
You're getting grounded
over here!

19:24.167 --> 19:27.667
A lot of stress
to do something...
This is a big event.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.833
And, uh, gonna hear
a few swear words,
I can well imagine.

19:30.867 --> 19:31.933
(KATE LAUGHING)

19:47.200 --> 19:49.433
You're going to have
to back up.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.700
ANDY:
Hey, don't go underneath it!
Get the hell away from it.

20:04.167 --> 20:07.433
Don't ever walk
underneath that, Kate!
That's just not smart.

20:12.367 --> 20:15.800
That's a big piece
of machinery to be swinging
towards your head.

20:15.833 --> 20:19.500
NARRATOR: Two tonnes
of heavy steel must perfectly
balance on the boats.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.133
If disaster strikes,

20:21.167 --> 20:25.333
Andy's vision of using
the sawmill to enhance
his home will be lost.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.800
I set this thing down on here,
I'm not liking the way
it's looking.

20:28.833 --> 20:32.500
It's cock-eyed,
I gotta pick it up,
square it up a little bit.

20:32.533 --> 20:37.733
That boat looks
like it's pretty low
in the water here.

20:37.767 --> 20:41.367
KATE: He gets tunnel vision
when he needs to get
something done.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.800
He's got it in his head
to go one way and sometimes
it's just a bit much.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.467
This way.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.500
A lot of stress
to do something,
this is a big event...

20:52.533 --> 20:54.933
And, you know,
worried about it going right.

20:55.467 --> 20:56.633
I can't do this.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.167
You never fuckin'
listen to me.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.733
Just be nicer
when things go smoother.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.267
ANDY: Yeah, that looks good.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.700
It's good
as it's going to get
right now, I think.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.700
I need to make sure
it's tied down

21:15.733 --> 21:18.000
and the balance is right
on the boats

21:18.033 --> 21:19.900
so that everything is
floating equally.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.233
If something shifts
and I'm not tied down
and balanced right,

21:24.267 --> 21:26.733
this sawmill could
come off the beams

21:26.767 --> 21:28.267
out in the middle
of the river,

21:28.300 --> 21:31.433
either capsizing the boats
or crushing the boats.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.267
I'm all done.
I've got the sawmill
the way I wanted.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.800
It's bound down
onto the boats.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.800
Real slow.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.333
It's time to start
heading down to Calico Bluff

21:52.367 --> 21:54.533
and that's where
the real work is
going to begin.

21:54.567 --> 21:55.767
Good.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.967
CHIP: We get what we get.
You never know with fish.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.233
It's like any other hunting.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.167
We're not watching
the wheat grow, buddy.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.800
We're chasing it down
and killing it.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.100
And they don't
always cooperate.

22:18.933 --> 22:21.733
CHIP: Come on, kiddos,
let's go. The fish ain't
gonna wait for us.

22:21.767 --> 22:24.200
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
spend summer as nomads

22:24.233 --> 22:26.267
across hundreds
of miles of river.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.200
Each day has to bring in
enough food to feed
the family.

22:31.733 --> 22:35.200
CHIP: Fish are in the water,
fish are in your net and
then they are in your hands.

22:35.233 --> 22:38.733
And between the water
and us having them
in our hands,

22:38.767 --> 22:40.433
there's a lot of variables.

22:40.467 --> 22:43.433
So we'll see what we get.
It's never predictable.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.433
We're going to put
the net on that side
of the slough

22:50.467 --> 22:53.433
but we're going to stake it
on this side of the slough
'cause it's so narrow.

22:53.467 --> 22:57.067
So we're going to have
a rope that goes out and
the net will be over there.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.867
So the fish will come out,
nailed!

23:02.867 --> 23:05.667
AGNES: As far
as I could remember
when I was a little kid

23:05.700 --> 23:07.033
we've always been here.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.233
My mother's been here,
my sister's been here.

23:09.267 --> 23:13.067
The pike are like this huge.
They come up and eat the mice.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.967
We used to watch
the mice come down
to the water

23:16.000 --> 23:18.800
and then a real big pike
would just come and grab it
and take it.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.600
-Tired.
-Stay still. Get off!

23:23.633 --> 23:25.467
CHIP:
Just let me push you hard.
How does that sound?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.767
Oh, no, they are doing it
on girl power alone.

23:27.800 --> 23:28.933
(GIGGLING)

23:28.967 --> 23:30.533
Super girls.

23:30.567 --> 23:31.933
I couldn't jump off.

23:34.033 --> 23:36.933
AGNES: This is how
we used to put it when I was
a little girl like you girls.

23:36.967 --> 23:40.867
I've always fished right here
in the same exact spot.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.933
I used to spend days out here.

23:42.967 --> 23:45.967
Then we'll come back
and go check it tomorrow.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.800
And then
we'll spend the whole
day down here

23:47.833 --> 23:50.733
and we'll cut our fish
and make our fish racks.

23:50.767 --> 23:51.900
And all that stuff.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.467
Hold on, Carol.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.900
(CONTINUES SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)

24:00.467 --> 24:04.333
Wasn't that the easiest net
setting we've ever done?

24:04.367 --> 24:08.033
CHIP: So now
my little tired children,
we'll take you back to camp

24:08.067 --> 24:09.367
'cause you're so sleepy now.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.267
CHIP: You got her?
MAN: Yeah.

24:21.967 --> 24:24.067
Good morning, Qutan.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.933
(KIDS CHATTERING)

24:28.600 --> 24:32.800
Everybody is tired.
Everybody had a long day
of getting ready.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.567
All the girls are real bossy.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.767
What can I say?

24:35.800 --> 24:37.767
You gotta take the kids,
take them home and
put them to bed.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.000
We're looking forward
to tomorrow. Maybe
the net will be full of fish.

24:41.033 --> 24:42.733
We're hoping for it, anyway.

24:45.467 --> 24:48.633
SUE: Happiness is a very
brief burst of emotion.

24:50.167 --> 24:53.133
But to be content
is to be comfortable
in a style of life.

24:57.367 --> 25:00.100
NARRATOR: Kavik River
has suddenly flooded
Sue's runway.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.767
If she doesn't stem the tide,

25:01.800 --> 25:06.167
the runway could be
washed out, putting her
entire business at risk.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.833
I'm gonna go see
where my river is.

25:08.867 --> 25:12.133
I can hear that
it's flowing more strongly.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.000
Holy shit!
It's too much, too fast.

25:16.033 --> 25:17.967
It came up two feet
in an hour.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.067
We can't control it going
this way unless we ditch it.

25:21.100 --> 25:25.500
What he's doing now
is creating a channel

25:25.533 --> 25:30.567
for that water to go out
across the tundra instead
of over my runway.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.900
Yeah, I got stuff
melting out everywhere.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.700
Yeah,
it's definitely flooding.

25:39.733 --> 25:42.200
Oh, crap!

25:42.233 --> 25:44.833
Damn it!
Yeah, this is what
I need to avoid.

25:49.233 --> 25:52.900
This is all the snow melting
and running over the ramp.

25:52.933 --> 25:55.200
This T-section,
there's my runway.

25:55.233 --> 25:56.567
Let's check and see
how deep it is.

26:01.133 --> 26:04.800
But I got that plane coming in
'cause I got another
3,000 pounds of goods

26:04.833 --> 26:07.333
that I gotta get in
over all this mess.

26:11.133 --> 26:13.233
It's a force of nature.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.000
And the flooding
is only going to get worse

26:15.033 --> 26:18.633
'cause you know,
its 24-hour daylight,
there is no sunset.

26:20.733 --> 26:26.233
This is my runway
and trying to prevent it
from getting this deep.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.400
Yeah, I gotta get this done.

26:34.833 --> 26:37.400
It's coming up so fast

26:37.433 --> 26:41.700
that we're actually
having to take gravel
from the runway itself

26:41.733 --> 26:43.433
to try and cause a dam.

26:43.467 --> 26:48.367
Where I would
normally ditch that ramp,
I can't do it...

26:48.400 --> 26:51.067
There's too much ice.
I can't bust through it.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.033
So, now it's damage control.

26:53.067 --> 26:56.867
Try to build a dike
high enough to force
it over that way.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.000
On the upswing,
I might try fishing later on.

27:07.200 --> 27:12.267
I mean, I am so grateful that
I have a minion this year,
that Rick is here.

27:12.300 --> 27:15.800
But if he tips that thing over
I'm going to beat him up.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.000
You better not get stuck,
motherfucker.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.700
I would hate to have
to beat him
first month on the job.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.067
Occasionally, shit happens.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.800
You are shitting me.

27:33.833 --> 27:37.467
-How you doing on fuel?
-Good.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.800
You're pushing it
a little too hard.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.200
It has never stalled like that
and then started.

27:43.233 --> 27:46.267
-Turn it off.
Let it sit for a minute.
-Yeah.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.567
(ENGINE ROARING)

27:54.067 --> 27:56.833
Liquid is not a normal state
for a runway.

27:56.867 --> 27:58.467
It's not a desired state.

27:59.533 --> 28:01.167
But it's too much, too fast.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.167
It came up two feet
in an hour.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.033
Planes can no longer
land in this section.

28:06.067 --> 28:09.967
So until this is dealt with,
until that water goes down,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.200
I'm out of business
on selling fuel.

28:12.233 --> 28:15.933
The bummer is
I'm also out of business
on receiving fuel.

28:17.067 --> 28:20.767
NARRATOR: No runway.
No supplies. No fuel.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.033
The melt is putting
a massive dent
in Sue's business plan.

28:24.067 --> 28:29.067
Nature is king out here, man.
You want to live out here,
just deal with shit.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.067
You can't get
all bummed out about it.
It's kind of cool.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.033
You know, the power of nature.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.833
GLENN: I'd rather die
up on one of these mountains
if I had to.

28:41.867 --> 28:43.500
But I'm not planning to.

28:43.533 --> 28:45.500
This is the best way of life
for me to live

28:45.533 --> 28:47.833
and I'm going to do it
as long as I can.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.367
NARRATOR:
A contaminated water hole
in the lake

28:57.400 --> 29:00.767
has Glenn on a search
for clean drinking water.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.800
GLENN: The lake water has just
become pretty contaminated
by the overflow on the ice.

29:04.833 --> 29:08.400
I'm getting water
from little streams
anywhere I can find it.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.067
This water here looks
a little bit better to me
than what's over on the lake.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.200
I'll still boil it this time
of year just because there
is so much run off and...

29:24.233 --> 29:27.667
Sure doesn't look as nice
as the water does
in the wintertime.

29:29.633 --> 29:34.167
It's got a brownish colour
now but it's just from
the vegetation, mostly.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.633
It's kind of like tea.

29:37.767 --> 29:41.067
In the spring time,
I have to get water
different places like this.

29:44.167 --> 29:47.800
Okay, that's enough.
I don't want too much 'cause
it takes so long to boil.

30:02.633 --> 30:05.233
That's it.
I gotta boil some more water.

30:05.267 --> 30:08.000
ANDY: One thing
I've learned living out here,
you never fight Mother Nature.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.500
You learn to work with her.

30:10.533 --> 30:13.467
If you work against her
you get your butt kicked
every time.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.633
NARRATOR: Andy Bassich
is on a 14-mile journey
with a two-tonne sawmill

30:22.667 --> 30:24.600
on a makeshift pontoon.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.533
I'm trying to stay
fairly close to the shore.

30:26.567 --> 30:30.067
The wind can make this river
really choppy, really rough,
really quick

30:30.100 --> 30:31.867
if it's blowing up
against the current.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.833
Just keeping an eye
on the course
I want to run here.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.767
NARRATOR:
If he doesn't
navigate skilfully,

30:40.800 --> 30:44.400
the whole machine
could end up at the bottom
of the Yukon River.

30:44.433 --> 30:49.633
ANDY: This is a big river
and it moves fast.
It's got a lot of power.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.967
You don't have to be
afraid of it but you gotta
respect this river.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.300
And if you lose respect
for it, it will bite you
in the ass real quick.

30:57.333 --> 31:01.500
Kate! Put it into neutral
and turn it off.

31:01.533 --> 31:05.400
Our house is just so wet
and mucky right now
and there's no bottom to it.

31:05.433 --> 31:09.133
So there's no support
for any kind
of heavy machinery.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.033
The biggest challenge
for me today

31:11.067 --> 31:14.867
is going to be trying
to get that sawmill up
onto the shoreline.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.667
-(LAUGHS) Fucking mud.
-I know.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.667
Jesus Christ.
Pain in the ass.
Fucking river!

31:24.933 --> 31:26.367
I gotta go get some beams.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.533
I gotta lay them across
to make a wider deck

31:28.567 --> 31:31.633
so that I don't have to worry
about her falling off.

31:31.667 --> 31:34.933
Then I have to
unchain everything

31:34.967 --> 31:38.933
and make sure the boats
aren't moving around at all
when I try and pull it off.

31:43.633 --> 31:46.600
The most important thing
right now is these ramps,

31:46.633 --> 31:49.967
once it starts coming
off the boat, don't break.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.567
They still tied on somewhere?

31:52.600 --> 31:56.633
-I think it's just pulling
the boats.
-No shit!

31:56.667 --> 32:00.567
ANDY: If they break,
then everything is going
to fall down onto the boats

32:00.600 --> 32:01.967
and it's going to
be a real mess.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.967
(KATE YELLS)

32:05.000 --> 32:07.633
You gotta talk to me
and tell me
what the hell is going on!

32:07.667 --> 32:09.967
I can't see anything
from here!

32:10.000 --> 32:11.567
There's nothing going on!

32:14.000 --> 32:17.767
Would you look right here?
Is that in the fucking mud?

32:17.800 --> 32:19.833
Tell me what the fuck
is going on!

32:19.867 --> 32:21.567
Yeah, that's in the mud.

32:23.033 --> 32:24.867
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

32:24.900 --> 32:28.800
I don't know what...
You're tipped
too far this way.

32:28.833 --> 32:31.300
You gotta fucking talk
to me about what
the fuck is going on,

32:31.333 --> 32:34.367
'cause I can't see
a fucking thing
from on that tractor.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.800
Please, okay?

32:37.367 --> 32:38.767
(KATE SPEAKING)

32:40.700 --> 32:43.133
It's not fucking
rocket science here.

32:43.167 --> 32:44.900
I'm not an easy guy
to live with.

32:44.933 --> 32:46.533
I'm a Type-A personality

32:46.567 --> 32:51.433
and I'm a do-er kind of guy
and I expect her
to put up, too.

32:51.467 --> 32:54.700
KATE: We're a normal couple.
We're not living some
kind of fairy tale here.

32:54.733 --> 32:56.833
We do have
our issues at time to time.

32:56.867 --> 33:00.000
But it doesn't make us
love each other any less.

33:00.033 --> 33:02.800
Fucking bullshit,
goddamn fucking design.

33:04.567 --> 33:07.367
Well, fuck me
in the goddamn ass.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.100
Jesus fucking Christ!

33:09.133 --> 33:13.000
NARRATOR: The handle strikes
Andy's foot with the force
of a sledgehammer.

33:14.733 --> 33:16.500
(GROANING)

33:19.667 --> 33:21.067
Fuck, that hurt, man.

33:22.533 --> 33:25.067
I'm working by myself,
I have nobody to help me

33:25.100 --> 33:27.767
so if suddenly
things go wrong,
I'm on my own.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.533
And I'm going
to have to deal with it
on my own.

33:31.567 --> 33:36.967
That makes a relatively
easy job become
very, very tough.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.333
Can you stand on this
right here?

33:38.367 --> 33:39.633
I'm going to go real slow.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.933
As this comes back,
you just walk down
the board here

33:41.967 --> 33:43.900
until that weight
is on this board.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.867
I'm gonna go real slow.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.533
Just, if anything, be ready
to step off of it. Okay?

33:49.567 --> 33:51.133
(GUNNING ENGINE)

33:57.733 --> 34:01.067
-Stop!
-Okay, get off of it!

34:04.400 --> 34:06.700
You've gotta be proactive
out here.

34:06.733 --> 34:09.900
And if you're not proactive,
you're either
going to get hurt

34:09.933 --> 34:13.267
or something is going
to be so difficult for you,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.733
you're not going to want
to stay out here.

34:18.567 --> 34:21.867
The sawmill is obviously
here in Calico. (LAUGHS)

34:21.900 --> 34:24.600
And it went...
For the most part,
it went really good.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.300
I'm real happy that it's here.

34:26.333 --> 34:30.333
I'll get it tuned up
and we'll start
making sawdust.

34:36.633 --> 34:40.733
I've been building
for 25 years.

34:40.767 --> 34:43.033
I mean, whether
it's been here
or someplace else.

34:43.067 --> 34:46.500
Every single year
I'm building another
cabin and...

34:46.533 --> 34:49.467
You know,
that's the part I love.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.467
The sawmill
is ready to rock and roll.

34:54.700 --> 34:57.267
It makes me
feel really good when I can

34:57.300 --> 35:00.467
knock down a tree,
drag it here,
turn it into lumber

35:00.500 --> 35:03.867
and turn into something
that Kate and I
can better our lives with.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.433
Our goal here is to live
a high quality of life here.

35:09.467 --> 35:11.733
A comfortable life here.

35:11.767 --> 35:14.233
And the sawmill is going
to make that possible

35:14.267 --> 35:20.033
for us to able to create
a lot of really wonderful
things for us in the future.

35:20.067 --> 35:24.600
Kitchen cabinets,
building our decks and
porches around our cabin,

35:24.633 --> 35:26.367
building a greenhouse...

35:27.300 --> 35:28.733
Well, that's pretty cool!

35:28.767 --> 35:32.167
ANDY: It's gonna be
a real plus in our life
for a long time to come.

35:36.633 --> 35:39.067
CHIP: Well, we can use
resources around us
to enrich our lives

35:39.100 --> 35:40.667
and to give ourselves
a steady income

35:40.700 --> 35:42.467
and to make our bodies healthy

35:42.500 --> 35:46.433
and to give us
a sense of culture and
responsibility and hard work.

35:46.467 --> 35:48.133
That's where it's at.

35:57.467 --> 36:02.400
I just like to make sure
my jerry jug is topped off
every morning.

36:03.800 --> 36:09.200
In case we decide
to turn someplace else

36:09.233 --> 36:11.867
and take a little
extra boat ride.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.667
NARRATOR: This morning,
the Hailstones will learn

36:13.700 --> 36:16.167
if the first leg
of their annual fishing trip

36:16.200 --> 36:18.533
begins with a bang
or a whimper.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.733
CHIP: Everybody ready?
KID: Yup.

36:20.767 --> 36:23.600
-You guys are happy? Well fed?
-KID: Yup. Yup!

36:23.633 --> 36:26.333
Let's go!

36:26.367 --> 36:29.400
AGNES: We are heading down
to check our net.
CHIP: Yep!

36:31.333 --> 36:34.667
Us girls will go
carry on doing
what we do best.

36:34.700 --> 36:35.700
Fishing.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.433
CHIP: The fish
is food security for us.

36:39.467 --> 36:41.933
Something we can
get in trade,
something we can sell.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.167
NARRATOR:
A full net today
will set the tone

36:44.200 --> 36:46.267
for the family's
long summer of hunting.

36:48.033 --> 36:51.033
An empty net could mean
many lean days ahead.

37:00.167 --> 37:03.333
KID: Oh, there's a fish!
CHIP: There's lots of fish.

37:03.367 --> 37:05.467
Look at all these pike we got.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.800
GIRL: Can I go get a fish?
CHIP: Well, ladies,
it's your show.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.267
That's a lot of fish.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.767
CHIP: Looks like a whole lot
of pike, or "ceelic"
as my wife calls them.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.933
AGNES:
The pike bite, so be careful.
GIRL: Yup, they got teeth.

37:19.967 --> 37:22.533
They're pretty tasty.
There's a certain way
that they'll cut them.

37:22.567 --> 37:24.833
They'll dry them up.
They'll be good.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.500
KID: Wow.

37:27.067 --> 37:29.267
Ceelic. Pike!

37:31.200 --> 37:34.767
-Watch out for the...
-KID: Oh, man, that's nasty.

37:34.800 --> 37:39.033
(SCREAMS) Look.
The fish got a fish in it.
Check it out.

37:39.067 --> 37:41.433
CHIP: He was
eating the baby pike?
AGNES: Yup.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.300
A fish with a fish
in its mouth.
That's cool.

37:43.333 --> 37:46.067
I got it!
Dad, look! I got it out.

37:47.300 --> 37:51.233
Oh, it's a baby one.

37:51.267 --> 37:53.967
CHIP:
Pike are pretty easy to find.
They stay in the same place

37:54.000 --> 37:57.267
and if we want pike,
we'll just go jig for pike.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.200
They are one of the real easy
fish to catch.

38:00.233 --> 38:04.633
AGNES: Once we have all these
hung and dried, they all
just last until the winter.

38:04.667 --> 38:09.233
The little bugs won't be able
to lay any eggs or stuff
into the meat.

38:11.200 --> 38:15.200
So what we are going to do
is just go on ahead
and take all the scales off.

38:15.233 --> 38:19.567
And when they're
taking the scales off
that's called covecsya.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.633
Then we will just
cut them all up,

38:23.667 --> 38:26.333
wash them and put them
on the drying rack.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.133
One day you'll be able
to teach your own daughters
how to fish.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.767
-At this spot.
-At this same exact spot.

38:36.700 --> 38:40.433
You'll be like me.
"When I was your age..."

38:40.967 --> 38:42.233
(LAUGHING)

38:45.233 --> 38:47.633
We'll leave them here
and let them dry here

38:47.667 --> 38:51.700
and then go home
and go have
a birthday party, Carol.

38:51.733 --> 38:53.267
(GROANING) It's so heavy.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.300
(WHOOPS)

39:00.733 --> 39:04.400
AGNES: Some birthday cake
for the birthday girl.

39:09.967 --> 39:13.400
CHIP: More blue!
Tied-dyed, huh?

39:13.433 --> 39:15.600
It's Carol's birthday.
She's 11 years old today.

39:15.633 --> 39:19.067
We can't turn off the lights
'cause we don't have any
'cause the sun is shining.

39:19.100 --> 39:21.300
-I want to put it on!
-I will, sweet pie.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.967
-All you get to do
is get sung...
-Put it in the middle!

39:24.800 --> 39:26.433
CHIP: Okay.

39:26.467 --> 39:28.000
(ALL CHEERING)

39:29.367 --> 39:31.300
Shall we hand you your things
one at a time

39:31.333 --> 39:34.233
or do you want
to close your eyes
and reach into the box?

39:34.267 --> 39:36.633
Go ahead.
Being the little girl you are,

39:36.667 --> 39:38.000
you get your own
white fish net.

39:38.033 --> 39:40.500
We gave you a net like this
that's not made yet

39:40.533 --> 39:42.133
so you could finish making it.

39:42.167 --> 39:46.100
You could add the floats
and then you could
do the leadline

39:46.133 --> 39:47.733
and then
you could put the ties in.

39:49.633 --> 39:51.433
-(CAROL SPEAKS)
-(AGNES ANSWERS)

39:51.467 --> 39:53.933
CAROL: These are traps?
CHIP: Trap beavers and ducks.

39:53.967 --> 39:55.433
Now I get to set my own traps.

39:55.467 --> 39:58.600
-Now we can go see the beaver
dam you were talking about.
-CHIP: Yup.

39:58.633 --> 40:01.900
I prefer to give my kids
tools and stuff instead
of giving them games.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.500
I prefer to give them
things that they can use.

40:05.767 --> 40:09.267
-And a mosquito net.
-Mosquito net.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.200
-Whoa! It's going to shock me!
-CHIP: No, it's not.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.867
The girl is famous
for taking away lighters
I give to her.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.400
"Oh, here, have a lighter."
"Hey! You can't
have lighters."

40:19.433 --> 40:21.933
So, (LAUGHS) she's now got
her own personal lighter.

40:21.967 --> 40:23.600
It's important to be able
to make a fire.

40:24.067 --> 40:25.533
(LAUGHING)

40:25.567 --> 40:27.700
She's well-versed
in all this stuff.
She knows what it's all for.

40:27.733 --> 40:29.300
She's an extremely
intelligent kid.

40:29.333 --> 40:30.800
(CHIP SPEAKS)

40:30.833 --> 40:32.567
And this is the first time
this girl has ever
had a birthday

40:32.600 --> 40:33.933
and didn't receive a firearm.

40:33.967 --> 40:36.600
She has many pistols,
she has shotguns,

40:36.633 --> 40:38.900
she has .22's,
she has a mose and a gat,

40:38.933 --> 40:40.767
she has an AK-47.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.167
Carol is not going to be
the kind that just sits
back and takes stuff.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.233
She's gonna be out
chasing it down
and killing it personally.

40:46.267 --> 40:49.033
And I kind of see that
coming up in her
and I want to nurture it.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.200
Oh, now I get to get my piece.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.567
She got in my face!

40:55.600 --> 40:57.767
AGNES: It's her piece.
It's her birthday!

41:03.233 --> 41:06.333
SUE: You know,
you can't whine about
what Mother Nature does.

41:06.367 --> 41:08.867
I mean, you can,
it just doesn't
get you anywhere.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.267
Mother Nature wins.

41:14.033 --> 41:17.400
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens
has lost her battle
with the spring run-off.

41:17.433 --> 41:21.767
She's had to shut down
her runway and cancel
all incoming flights.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.200
SUE: Even on a short trip
to go check out the runway,

41:24.233 --> 41:28.500
doesn't matter
if you want to go take a poop,
take a weapon.

41:28.533 --> 41:31.500
No sense pinching one off
if you can't also
fire one off.

41:32.933 --> 41:35.233
So I had a look
at the Kavik rapids.

41:35.267 --> 41:37.867
This part,
that can get full of water.

41:37.900 --> 41:39.300
It's really full of water now.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.100
Might as well have a canoe
and a couple of paddles
'cause you're upstream.

41:46.167 --> 41:47.500
I mean, I'm done.

41:47.533 --> 41:50.600
Without a runaway
that people can land on
I can't get guests,

41:50.633 --> 41:52.200
I can't sell fuel.

41:52.233 --> 41:55.800
That's how I generate income
so I'm even allowed
to be here.

41:55.833 --> 41:58.533
I can't fix this
with machinery.

41:58.567 --> 42:01.267
I can't fix it
with high hopes.

42:01.300 --> 42:05.267
The only thing
that's gonna fix this
is letting it go.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.600
Letting nature do
whatever it's going to do.

42:08.633 --> 42:14.967
When it's done,
get the little Sue-cat and a
Bob-cat and go to work on it.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.967
This is where
we blocked it off.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.833
We thought we were so slick.

42:20.867 --> 42:24.600
I was still
bringing the groceries.
Bob landed.

42:24.633 --> 42:26.267
Done now.

42:29.333 --> 42:32.667
What I do is
I take the cautionary cones
and I'm going to block it off,

42:32.700 --> 42:37.067
so that the pilots
even from the air go,
"Why the hell... Oh, shit."

42:37.100 --> 42:39.400
You know, it's kind of an
"Oh, shit" eyesight factor on,

42:39.433 --> 42:41.700
"Don't land in the middle
of the runway, fool."

42:41.733 --> 42:48.400
It's a destructive force
but it's also one hell of
a renewal of life out here.

42:48.433 --> 42:52.833
As a business owner now,
it keeps my revenue
from coming in.

42:52.867 --> 42:55.333
But all those animals
and everything else,

42:55.367 --> 42:57.367
they're going
to thrive off of this.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.033
King of my own castle
and my castle says,
"Stop here."
