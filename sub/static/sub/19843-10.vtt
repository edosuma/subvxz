WEBVTT

01:14.740 --> 01:17.152
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:26.870 --> 01:27.996
What?

01:30.670 --> 01:31.739
Where are we?

01:34.420 --> 01:35.409
Home.

01:36.470 --> 01:37.585
Hmm...

01:38.260 --> 01:39.750
It's not the dojo.

01:40.180 --> 01:41.670
Hmm, no.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.518
But it's the safest place I know.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.305
How do you feel?

01:48.020 --> 01:50.978
Yeah, I'm, uh...

01:51.270 --> 01:53.773
I'm tired.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.692
I was so worried about you.

01:57.990 --> 01:58.979
You okay?

02:01.990 --> 02:04.572
I feel great.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.995
Hmm.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.159
What happened?

02:16.340 --> 02:18.626
You healed me, Danny.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.339
Saved my life.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.225
It's a lot...

02:35.860 --> 02:37.145
having to keep
a secret like this.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.152
And I... I understand now why Ward's...

02:40.780 --> 02:42.065
why he is the way he is.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.986
Yeah, I think we
might be losing him, Joy.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.498
You put him in
a terrible position, Dad.

02:48.750 --> 02:49.865
Lying to everyone.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.991
Standing right next to me
while I cried over you,

02:52.170 --> 02:54.081
knowing he could do something about it,
he could make it better.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.950
No, he couldn't make it better.
No one could.

02:57.380 --> 02:58.540
Hey, Joy.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.887
Joy, I understand
your feelings are hurt. I do.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.130
I had no choice.

03:02.890 --> 03:04.551
I was trapped.
I had to stay hidden.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.306
You told Danny.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.511
Danny found out.
That wasn't my choice.

03:09.730 --> 03:11.391
You know,
sometimes in life, um,

03:11.850 --> 03:13.977
things happen that
we're not prepared for.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.436
You know, we just do the best we can.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.600
Do you remember those nights?

03:21.450 --> 03:22.610
When I was sick?

03:23.240 --> 03:27.119
And you and Ward were there
every two hours.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.109
Yeah.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.121
Yeah, we had to
turn you in your bed.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.200
Keep you from getting bedsores.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.256
Mm-hm. You were just teenagers.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.678
But you wouldn't let
the hospice nurse do it.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.966
You were so thin...

03:45.300 --> 03:47.552
and fragile.
You were like parchment.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.050
I was afraid they might break you.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.299
And sometimes...

03:52.560 --> 03:54.141
sometimes, I'd wake up...

03:55.770 --> 03:58.398
and I'd see you there,
asleep in the chair...

03:59.150 --> 04:01.607
and you'd be looking just like you were
when you were kids.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.229
So peaceful.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.277
And in that darkness, I'd pray.

04:06.450 --> 04:08.441
And I would plead to
the universe that if I...

04:08.660 --> 04:10.992
ifI ever had a second chance,
I'd do anything.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.573
I would do anything,
I'd pay any price, to keep you away.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.281
Keep you away from that pain
and that heartache.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.706
I wanted to protect you from suffering,

04:20.510 --> 04:22.466
because you'd endured so much already.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.881
Joy...

04:25.590 --> 04:28.218
Joy, I... I love you.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.511
I'm... I'm sorry.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.806
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for, you know,

04:34.980 --> 04:36.436
I'm sorry for all of... all of this.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.435
I'm just glad the universe listened.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.026
Yeah.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.957
What was it like?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.279
What? Death?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.582
Hmm. It was like
when I was a kid...

05:07.720 --> 05:10.382
coming home from school
through the snow, and...

05:14.140 --> 05:16.347
and then I'd be standing
on the porch, freezing,

05:16.520 --> 05:20.729
and on the other side was comfort.
Comfort and warmth.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.480
But this time...

05:24.900 --> 05:27.107
This time, when I tried the handle,
the door wouldn't open.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.400
And I could hear you.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.073
I could hear you and Ward
on the other side, and...

05:32.750 --> 05:35.401
I... I wanted to be
on the other side so much.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.240
But the harder I tried...

05:39.340 --> 05:40.739
the further I'd just...

05:42.590 --> 05:44.501
I'd drift away and...

05:45.510 --> 05:48.047
it would become colder...

05:49.390 --> 05:50.596
and colder.

05:54.770 --> 05:57.136
And, uh... And I was here.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.936
Restored.

06:00.770 --> 06:01.896
Joy...

06:04.530 --> 06:07.272
I want us to be
together again, happy.

06:07.820 --> 06:08.900
Happy and whole.

06:10.660 --> 06:11.775
I want that, too.

06:13.910 --> 06:14.899
Yeah.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.031
But this is strange.
This is...

06:17.460 --> 06:18.449
Hey, I know.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.326
- This is really unreal. I...
- I know. I know.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.531
I know. Ward... Ward found it
difficult at first, too.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.086
But after a while...

06:24.250 --> 06:25.547
Where is he?

06:25.800 --> 06:28.337
- I'm worried about him.
- Ward has a problem, Joy.

06:28.510 --> 06:29.636
You know that, don't you?

06:29.970 --> 06:31.506
Yeah, Dad, I know.
I know he has a problem.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.387
I've talked to him about it,
and it hasn't helped.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.478
Oh, well, you know, addicts can be...
they can be unpredictable.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.517
But we've gotta do everything
we can to help him.

06:40.810 --> 06:41.799
Everything.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.641
But that shouldn't keep us
from getting Rand back.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.231
You know, and turning it into
what I'd always hoped for.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.776
Our family's legacy.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.809
- I got a plan for that.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.571
Ward told me about the...
the blackmail.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.480
- I... I want you to step away from that.
- Why?

06:55.660 --> 06:58.117
You just leave that for,
you know, that...

06:58.330 --> 07:00.537
that Hogarth and the courts to work out.

07:00.710 --> 07:02.450
And I don't... I don't want you
risking anything.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.660
Where's the risk?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.251
People will ask you questions,

07:06.420 --> 07:08.832
and you're... you're gonna wanna answer
honestly and truthfully.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.749
Yeah, under oath.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.499
Mm-hm. Probably.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.505
Hopefully, it won't come to that.

07:15.430 --> 07:16.761
- Yeah.
- Hey.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.055
Look, I know that secrets...

07:22.860 --> 07:24.396
secrets and lies have...

07:24.770 --> 07:27.182
they've taken
a toll on our family.

07:27.730 --> 07:29.357
They've almost ruined us, but...

07:31.450 --> 07:33.611
I want a future
free from all of that.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.861
For you, for me...

07:36.870 --> 07:37.905
for all of us.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.949
Hey.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.199
Okay.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.668
This is where I came when
I first returned

09:10.840 --> 09:12.296
from my grandfather's in Japan.

09:13.630 --> 09:16.292
What is this?
A monastery? A school?

09:16.680 --> 09:18.216
Uh... A bit of both.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.710
A safe place for people who need a home.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.630
They took me in, helped me get settled.

09:26.810 --> 09:27.890
Who's "they"?

09:28.980 --> 09:30.971
Bakuto and his group.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.599
Your sensei?

09:33.280 --> 09:34.269
Our sensei.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.446
Everyone here.

09:37.990 --> 09:39.821
- Huh.
- This is my family, Danny.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.780
Maybe the only one I've ever known.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.166
I'm glad you're here.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.082
Danny, Colleen.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.875
Welcome.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.330
How are you feeling?

09:54.010 --> 09:56.422
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.796
Thanks for showing me how to heal her.

10:00.510 --> 10:01.670
Of course.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.426
I see it took a lot out of you, though.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.805
Yeah.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.180
Are you ready to recharge?

10:09.810 --> 10:10.970
What do you mean?

10:12.610 --> 10:15.317
Colleen told me you were the Iron Fist,
the Immortal Weapon.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.028
Uh... Not many people know what that is.

10:20.530 --> 10:23.158
Well, it's always been
a special interest of mine.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.367
But you weren't taught
how to recharge your chi?

10:27.540 --> 10:31.283
Let's just say my training
went a little sideways.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.586
Fair enough.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.330
Then step this way.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.881
Just follow my lead.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.802
I've studied many traditions,
so you'll recognise most of the moves.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.512
But in this order,
they're gonna take you somewhere else.

10:50.190 --> 10:52.681
I call it harnessing
the Five Elemental Energies.

11:04.870 --> 11:06.235
Why are you frowning?

11:09.210 --> 11:10.359
I'm not.

11:11.580 --> 11:12.626
But you are.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.628
Our bodies always give away
our inner truth.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.296
Release whatever's binding you.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.331
Pain, lack, fear...

11:22.930 --> 11:27.014
and replace it with energy,
abundance, trust.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.180
You are rooted...

11:31.100 --> 11:33.603
tied to the force that binds all life.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.720
Let it course through you.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.483
Let it replace everything that is broken.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.471
Now... how do you feel?

12:24.490 --> 12:25.809
Hungry.

12:26.410 --> 12:27.775
I can fix that, too.

12:28.410 --> 12:29.946
Colleen, can you go ahead
and let the kitchen know

12:30.120 --> 12:31.109
that we're on our way?

12:31.290 --> 12:34.077
There's something
I'd like to show Danny first.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.536
Yeah. Sure.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.836
She's very special.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.920
Yeah.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.422
Colleen has spoken to me
about you quite a bit.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.260
That's funny...

12:52.180 --> 12:53.431
she's never mentioned you.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.589
Hmm.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.760
She's just being protective.

12:57.650 --> 12:58.719
Does that bother you?

12:58.940 --> 12:59.975
No.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.602
But why keep all of this a secret?

13:04.530 --> 13:08.523
There's a difference
between "secret" and "secure."

13:09.490 --> 13:13.039
You see, we take in people
from all walks of life who need safety.

13:14.330 --> 13:16.878
They need that because their lives
were complicated...

13:18.000 --> 13:19.376
even dangerous, sometimes.

13:20.340 --> 13:23.412
Because of that,
we try and keep a low profile.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.884
We give them a safe haven...
and much more.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.709
What's that?

13:29.220 --> 13:32.462
Well, each person needs a purpose,
something to believe in,

13:33.060 --> 13:34.220
a place to belong,

13:34.390 --> 13:38.429
a community that can help you
become all that you can be.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.436
So it's a cult?

13:42.150 --> 13:45.984
Yes, just, uh, just like the Girl Scouts.
So... be prepared.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.229
And Gao?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.650
What have you done with her?

13:53.160 --> 13:56.368
She's been taken out of commission.
There's no need to worry.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.911
She murdered my parents...

14:01.550 --> 14:02.869
almost had us killed.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.467
I need to know
where she's gone.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.007
I've placed her in confinement

14:09.180 --> 14:11.501
until we can be sure that_
turning her over to the police

14:11.680 --> 14:12.999
will get us the right results.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.920
Her power is far-reaching.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.397
We can't take any chances.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.567
Good pace, guys.

14:22.770 --> 14:25.022
This place...
it seems familiar.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.023
It should.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.573
The same atmosphere that shaped you
in the monastery is present here.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.867
We're seeking to build character,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.743
discipline, educate young people
in the same way.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.416
Did Colleen tell you
everything about me?

14:44.130 --> 14:45.620
Not everything.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.626
Please, my office is this way.

14:54.430 --> 14:55.419
SenseL

14:55.600 --> 14:57.170
I understand when you say
you're training people.

14:57.390 --> 14:58.846
Can I get you to sign this?

14:59.140 --> 15:00.550
But for what, exactly?

15:00.810 --> 15:03.051
You wanna know
what's In It for me?

15:03.650 --> 15:04.765
Well, yeah.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.526
Ever since I got to New York,

15:06.690 --> 15:08.567
whenever people find out
I'm the Iron Fist,

15:08.740 --> 15:11.777
they... they want to use it
for their own purposes.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.572
Yeah. We're not using people.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.150
They make their own choices.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.997
Participate only in things
they feel comfortable with.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.667
Please, come in.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.290
Have a seat.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.830
A change is coming, Danny.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.794
Something significant.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.307
And I wanna be ready.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.385
I want my family and friends to be ready.

15:39.850 --> 15:43.399
When I heard about what you did
with the pricing of the drugs at Rand,

15:43.770 --> 15:45.351
I knew we had similar values.

15:46.020 --> 15:49.274
_ The world_ we live in now
IS run by corporations, not governments.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.481
Oligarchies of
the rich and powerful.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.906
But that's not gonna last much longer.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.360
But Rand is a corporation.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.405
Exactly my point.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.031
Since you've been back,
what have you discovered?

16:00.660 --> 16:04.164
A well-functioning organisation
focused on the common good,

16:04.380 --> 16:06.245
or... something else?

16:06.880 --> 16:09.337
Rand isn't what you hoped it would be.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.962
But you are just the person
who can turn it around.

16:13.220 --> 16:14.209
I'm sure of it.

16:15.510 --> 16:16.716
What I'm about to show you

16:16.890 --> 16:19.176
is something that's been
kept secret for decades.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.187
Hidden by
the Chinese government...

16:24.150 --> 16:25.720
because they didn't know
how to explain it.

16:26.900 --> 16:30.563
But I think you'll understand it
immediately.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.522
In 1948, a group of Chinese soldiers
got lost in the mountains

16:36.700 --> 16:39.328
during a mission being recorded
for propaganda purposes.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.740
protecting this passage.

17:09.610 --> 17:13.944
And as you can see,
he had no interest in letting them pass.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.941
That's where you're headed, Danny.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.769
That's what you could be.

17:21.450 --> 17:23.452
That's what an Iron Fist is.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.336
Why are you so interested
in the Iron Fist?

17:36.090 --> 17:39.344
I've spent my entire life
in and around dojos and monasteries,

17:39.550 --> 17:41.177
training with masters of all kinds...

17:45.600 --> 17:48.148
I thought they were
fairy tales for children...

17:49.270 --> 17:51.682
until I was gifted that ﬁlm.

17:52.610 --> 17:54.851
Once I saw it,
I became obsessed,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.447
learning all that I could
about the Iron Fist.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.400
What it was capable of.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.485
What it could achieve.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.280
That's how you know
about the healing.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.663
All the qigong masters talk about it,
but as a theory,

18:08.370 --> 18:12.204
because they haven't met you...
don't possess what you have.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.332
And, Danny, there's more
where that came from.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.830
I showed you how to heal Colleen,

18:18.010 --> 18:20.968
and I've just opened up a way
for you to recharge your chi.

18:22.390 --> 18:25.473
I can help you become
what you were meant to be.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.681
But that was the Iron Fist doing his duty.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.055
Guarding an entry.

18:31.230 --> 18:34.472
If that's why you're interested
in me, then...

18:35.610 --> 18:36.770
you got the wrong man.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.283
I don't need a guard, Danny.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.109
I need a partner.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.417
With you at my side,
no one would stand against us.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.287
The Gaos of the world
would be destroyed.

18:53.710 --> 18:55.086
So what do you know about Gao?

18:55.590 --> 18:57.717
I've been trying to stop her
for a long time.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.967
I have seven students here
rehabbing from her drugs.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.171
When you ask me
what's in it for me,

19:04.350 --> 19:05.556
that's what it is.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.880
There are Gaos everywhere.

19:08.390 --> 19:10.972
I need you to train
and lead a group of people

19:11.150 --> 19:13.857
who will take care of those
that our culture's left behind.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.026
The marginalised and forgotten.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.140
People like Colleen.

19:19.740 --> 19:20.809
People like you.

19:22.820 --> 19:23.866
Come on.

19:24.490 --> 19:25.479
I'm a billionaire.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.195
Is that how you feel?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.029
Inside?

19:29.790 --> 19:33.328
You know you don't fit in at Rand.
I've read the news.

19:34.420 --> 19:35.956
You can use
help there as well.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.000
I can provide that.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.007
But your destiny...

19:42.470 --> 19:43.459
is here.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.302
Doing something only you can do.

19:56.770 --> 19:58.772
- He's not picking up.
- Oh, let it ring.

19:58.940 --> 19:59.986
Hey, Joy.

20:00.150 --> 20:01.196
Danny?

20:01.360 --> 20:02.600
Uh... I've been meaning to call.
What's up?

20:02.780 --> 20:03.986
Yea/7, fly/7t.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.982
Well, Danny, I have someone here
who wants to speak with you.

20:09.790 --> 20:10.779
Danny.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.449
Harold?

20:13.370 --> 20:14.371
You ’re alive.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.529
Oh, why wouldn't I be?

20:15.790 --> 20:19.009
Uh... I came to the penthouse.
There was... there was blood everywhere.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.750
I thought Gao...

20:21.260 --> 20:23.967
- 0h, nota chance. Hey, listen...
- And Joy?

20:24.300 --> 20:25.346
She knows?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.842
Yes. Yes, it's all right.
I told her everything.

20:29.350 --> 20:32.228
Hey, we're, uh, working on a plan
to get Rand back,

20:32.390 --> 20:33.721
and, uh,
you're a big part of that.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.977
Look, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

20:36.270 --> 20:38.477
Hey, no excuses.
This Is important; Danny.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.891
I haven't been very reliable, I know.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.948
But you'll be glad to hear
that Gao is finally out of the way.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.366
- What?
- Yeah.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.079
I met this guy named Bakuto.
He helped me put an end to her.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.029
Oh, she's dead?

20:53.410 --> 20:54.490
I can't confirm that.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.419
I'm trying to find out if
she's been sent to jail or something else.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.548
But I've been assured by Bakuto
that she's out of commission.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.677
Oh, and who exactly is this, uh... Bakuto?

21:06.300 --> 21:07.426
He's a friend.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.635
I think.

21:09.970 --> 21:11.551
Hey, Danny,
just be careful, all right?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.722
And, uh, get here
as soon as you can.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.300
- Oh, he did it.
- What?

21:19.520 --> 21:20.817
Yeah, he did it.

21:21.730 --> 21:23.482
- He did what?
- He did it. He did it.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.062
Oh, man, he has...
he's eliminated Gao.

21:27.740 --> 21:30.322
- He has eliminated...
- Who's Gao?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.538
- Oh, we have to celebrate.
- What...

21:32.700 --> 21:34.156
We have to celebrate. Oh, yes.

21:34.370 --> 21:35.610
Wait, explain this to me, who...

21:36.080 --> 21:37.411
who's Gao?

21:37.580 --> 21:40.128
Balvenie, 40-year-old.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.080
- This is supposed to be the best...
- No, I'm not...

21:42.260 --> 21:43.579
...best single malt of all time.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.671
- Come on. Open it.
- Dad, it is too early to be drinking...

21:45.970 --> 21:47.961
- One for you. One for me. Come on.
- I can't.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.756
- One for you, and one for me.
- No, I don't want it. Dad, stop!

21:51.100 --> 21:52.419
- Yeah.
- Dad.

21:57.690 --> 21:59.476
I didn't... I didn't...

22:03.740 --> 22:05.890
I'm... I'm so sorry, Joy.

22:06.530 --> 22:09.738
Um... I'll clean this up.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.951
Come in.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.291
He's just finished a call, sir.

22:22.460 --> 22:23.495
To whom?

22:23.670 --> 22:24.659
Joy Meachum.

22:25.090 --> 22:26.830
And she passed
the phone off to a Harold.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.829
Harold Meachum?

22:29.760 --> 22:30.920
Are you sure about that name?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.091
Yes, sir.
And they spoke about Madame Gao.

22:34.890 --> 22:36.972
Send the entire
transcript to my computer.

22:37.350 --> 22:39.932
And see if you can trace back that call
to its exact location.

22:40.310 --> 22:41.470
Right away, sir.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.446
How was he?

22:49.740 --> 22:52.402
He... seems ready.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.328
Thank you for all you've done.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.399
I didn't do anything.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.622
I know this has been hard on you.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.786
We can tell him now though, right?

23:02.960 --> 23:05.542
_ Soon. _
I still need to test a couple of things.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.250
But we need to be honest.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.749
I need to be.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.960
I don't like keeping things from him.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.346
He'll understand.

23:15.810 --> 23:16.925
What if he doesn't?

23:18.270 --> 23:20.841
Then... he's not right for you.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.642
It's complicated... I know.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.520
But it's for the best.

23:29.110 --> 23:30.657
He may be hurt in the beginning,

23:30.820 --> 23:33.618
but if he feels about you
the way you feel about him...

23:34.620 --> 23:36.156
he'll make the right choice.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.215
Danny!

23:56.350 --> 23:57.590
Hey, Danny!

23:57.770 --> 23:59.419
- Hey, Darryl.
- What are you doing here?

23:59.640 --> 24:00.686
Colleen brought me.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.057
- Are you coming onboard here?
- Oh, thinking about it.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.937
That would be so kick-ass.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.316
_ I... I've been
telling them about you.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.983
This is the guy that whacked that kid
with a pole.

24:10.150 --> 24:12.482
It's, uh... not my greatest moment.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.025
Well, I thought it was awesome.

24:14.950 --> 24:17.282
So... you like it here?

24:17.740 --> 24:18.820
It's what you wanted?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.958
- Yeah. It's great.
- How come?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.450
Well, people care about me here.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.957
I can, sort of, fit in wherever.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.621
- This is the first family I've ever had.
- Food's good, too.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.467
Yeah, and I've been learning a ton.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.002
- I bet I could take you now.
- Yeah?

24:34.180 --> 24:35.215
You think?

24:42.020 --> 24:44.090
See? I told you.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.555
So, what's your day like?

24:47.190 --> 24:48.566
Can you come and go as you please?

24:48.770 --> 24:50.146
Kind of. We have free time.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.312
We all live in the dorms here,
but there's a curfew.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.986
You ever try and sneak out?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.731
- Security's too tight.
- And nobody really wants to.

25:00.370 --> 25:02.452
Are there any areas off-limits?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.570
Yeah, a few.
Mostly back that way.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.190
I talked to all of 'em already.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.070
Clear the east perimeter.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.273
You know the deal.
Tray by the door when you're done.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.591
Of course.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.356
I'm guessing you can see me.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.358
Well, I'm glad you're finally getting
what you deserve.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.316
Punishment is so ju yen/7e.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.816
And quite boring, I might add.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.361
Not for me.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.241
I’m not surprised.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.997
You ’re 5177/ a ch/lo'.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.207
Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.739
Is that what this is?

27:57.250 --> 27:58.706
I offer you freedom,

27:59.510 --> 28:02.673
was wﬂ/ing to let you live
whatever life you wanted.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.676
And you rejected that oﬁ‘er,

28:05.100 --> 28:06.806
pursued and kidnapped me.

28:07.350 --> 28:11.138
Then you ran towards s/a very
as fast as you could.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.509
You ’re an idiot.

28:13.690 --> 28:14.725
Really?

28:15.650 --> 28:17.936
Now you're baiting me with insults?

28:18.110 --> 28:22.774
I am treating you with respect
by being who I truly am.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.021
Not everyone around you does the same.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.031
That's not true!

28:29.250 --> 28:32.117
They are stealing your ah/lity to trust.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.280
That is how they crush you.

28:35.630 --> 28:36.619
VVho?

28:37.750 --> 28:39.377
The Hand.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.960
What are you talking about?

28:43.260 --> 28:45.421
Open your eyes, young man.

28:45.970 --> 28:47.847
Where do you think you are?

28:51.930 --> 28:54.182
I see you found what you were looking for.

28:55.060 --> 28:59.224
She's a piece of work, isn't she?
Always spinning a new web.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.640
I was just looking for some answers.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.775
You won't find them here.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.901
Trust me, I've tried.

29:07.450 --> 29:09.111
But I'm glad you came...

29:09.580 --> 29:12.037
because now you know
she won't work with us...

29:12.750 --> 29:14.820
but she won't work against us, either.

29:53.950 --> 29:56.327
I deliver him back
into your capable hands.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.239
Enjoy your evening.

30:10.890 --> 30:11.879
Hey.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.509
What's wrong?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.100
Gao's here.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.020
Oh.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.525
Did you talk to her?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.650
Manipulating as always.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.161
Working an angle.

30:41.670 --> 30:44.298
Trying to get me to question everything.

30:46.130 --> 30:47.210
Even you.

30:50.220 --> 30:51.289
In what way?

30:53.510 --> 30:55.307
She implied that this was the Hand.

30:56.810 --> 30:57.845
Bakuto.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.806
There was a_ceremonial knife
in his office.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.187
I recognised it because men
from the Hand used one like it.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.400
Colleen?

31:12.530 --> 31:14.327
I wanted to tell you from the beginning.

31:16.450 --> 31:17.439
No.

31:17.620 --> 31:18.700
- Please, just listen...
- No, no, no...

31:18.870 --> 31:20.576
_ Listen to me. _
Give me a chance to explain...

31:20.750 --> 31:21.910
Explain what?

31:22.420 --> 31:24.297
The Hand are murderers and killers!

31:24.460 --> 31:26.337
Gao! It was... all Gao.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.501
She doesn't represent us. She...

31:28.670 --> 31:32.379
She is part of a rogue faction of the Hand
that deals drugs and destroys lives,

31:32.550 --> 31:34.347
- but that is not who we are.
- That's your story?

31:34.510 --> 31:36.842
That she's the bad Hand
and you're the good Hand?

31:37.140 --> 31:38.220
Come on!

31:38.770 --> 31:40.931
You've been lying to me this whole time!

31:41.650 --> 31:42.935
That's not true. I didn't...

31:43.730 --> 31:46.062
Did Bakuto give you that money
the first time we met in the park?

31:46.230 --> 31:47.219
Don't be ridiculous.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.698
Was it okay with him
when I stayed around at the dojo?

31:49.860 --> 31:52.738
- This isn't some conspiracy, Danny.
- Then explain it to me.

31:53.530 --> 31:54.861
Make it make sense.

31:55.620 --> 31:57.997
Because right now,
all I'm hearing are lies

31:58.160 --> 31:59.957
- and evasion...
- I already met you!

32:01.420 --> 32:02.876
I already felt the way I feel.

32:03.040 --> 32:06.498
And was that before
or after you knew about the Fist?

32:07.130 --> 32:08.119
Before.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.348
And was it his idea
that you sleep with me?

32:17.680 --> 32:18.669
Danny...

32:18.970 --> 32:22.349
So when did Bakuto approach you
with this... this idea of recruiting me?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.397
Because that's what all of this is about,
isn't it?

32:24.610 --> 32:26.817
- Recruiting isn't what we do.
- But it is.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.353
The only reason anybody is
interested in me is because of the Fist.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.988
My feelings are for Danny Rand,
not the Iron Fist.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.618
Then why lie? Why go along with this?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.445
Because you've been brainwashed!

32:38.620 --> 32:41.862
Oh, that's hilarious coming from someone
who grew up inside of a cult!

32:42.250 --> 32:43.956
Just... think about it.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.839
Every time someone mentions the Hand,
you freak out.

32:49.210 --> 32:52.373
You run off to the docks or...
or to buildings filled with fighters

32:52.550 --> 32:54.040
without a second thought. Why?

32:54.390 --> 32:57.382
Because you grew up in a place
hearing one story about us

32:57.720 --> 32:59.711
and nobody ever questioned that view.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.220
I understand.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.597
But those were lies shoved down
your throat

33:04.770 --> 33:06.146
- when you were a kid...
- No. No.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.187
...by people who live in the past.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.686
Just consider for a moment that maybe...

33:11.650 --> 33:12.639
just maybe...

33:14.240 --> 33:15.229
they got it wrong.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.319
No.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.996
Danny, this is my family.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.413
And my family are dead
because of your family.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.046
You're not listening.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.660
- That was Gao.
- I am listening.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.836
Everything you're saying is bullshit.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.681
And coming from someone
that I thought I could trust.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.125
Hello.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.757
Please, be seated.

34:17.630 --> 34:18.710
What the hell is this?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.210
Sorry to interrupt your dinner,

34:21.930 --> 34:24.558
but please eat. I... I don't mind.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.747
My name is Bakuto.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.992
I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.

34:49.790 --> 34:52.031
Ah. Danny told you about me.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.546
Not directly.

34:53.750 --> 34:57.163
But... you should know by now
that our reach is extensive.

34:59.510 --> 35:02.923
I guess I was too optimistic
to imagine the Hand would let me go.

35:04.100 --> 35:08.139
I think you'll find I'm much more
easy-going than Gao.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.471
You see, she leads through fear.

35:10.850 --> 35:14.684
I find partnership to be
a much more effective method.

35:15.820 --> 35:18.448
Oh... what are you proposing?

35:20.280 --> 35:23.192
Everything that is Gao's is now mine.

35:24.370 --> 35:27.783
You proceed as you have
but with a different goal.

35:29.370 --> 35:30.530
And what would that be?

35:32.880 --> 35:33.949
A way out.

35:35.210 --> 35:37.701
A return to public life for you.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.630
Go on.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.886
I'm listening.

37:32.410 --> 37:33.741
Look, Singleton,

37:33.910 --> 37:35.912
we have to be extra cautious this time.

38:06.530 --> 38:08.657
This is disappointing.

38:10.870 --> 38:13.828
I was hoping you wouldn't take the bait
and dig further.

38:14.710 --> 38:17.611
Even sneaking down to kill Gao
would have been better than this.

38:17.870 --> 38:19.371
More lies.

38:19.790 --> 38:21.030
Simply a test.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.046
And you failed.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.926
No.

39:14.930 --> 39:18.093
Wow.
You are the worst Iron Fist ever.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.260
Davos?

39:27.940 --> 39:30.602
You weren't banging the assistant
in the copy room again, were you?

39:30.780 --> 39:31.940
What?

39:34.790 --> 39:37.076
- Harold?
- Surprised to see me, I know.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.497
What are you... How?

39:40.710 --> 39:42.826
Oh, it's really too much
to go into right now.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.035
It hardly matters.

39:44.290 --> 39:47.544
Um. We need a moment.
Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?

39:58.480 --> 40:01.438
You might wanna check the file
I left on your desk.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.657
- I don't understand.
- Oh, yes you do.

40:12.490 --> 40:15.527
Prostitution, embezzling money
from the Rand pension fund

40:15.700 --> 40:17.076
into your Cayman accounts...

40:19.410 --> 40:21.150
Listen, I don't know
what this is all about

40:21.330 --> 40:24.242
- or how this is even possible, but...
- This is about legacy.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.160
Mine...

40:26.670 --> 40:27.659
and yours.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.001
What?

40:30.510 --> 40:33.172
If you thought it was possible to kick
my children out the door

40:33.340 --> 40:36.594
and steal everything we, as a family,
built over the years,

40:36.810 --> 40:38.425
then you're sadly mistaken.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.919
This is a blackmail scheme.

40:40.770 --> 40:41.839
Well, it won't work.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.260
No, it won't. No, it won't.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.476
Blackmail's about the last thing
on my mind.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.853
I'm here to talk about... our children...

40:50.990 --> 40:55.029
and... what we owe them as fathers.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.362
- I'm calling security.
- Oh, this is exhausting.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.570
You know, you don't think
I had them turned off

41:00.700 --> 41:02.577
for routine maintenance?
Come on, Lawrence.

41:06.750 --> 41:07.876
Now...

41:08.670 --> 41:10.160
Now, I think we can, uh...

41:10.880 --> 41:13.838
we can both agree that our children
and their lives

41:14.010 --> 41:16.046
are the most important thing, right?

41:16.890 --> 41:18.630
- I guess.
- Yeah? Have you thought at all about

41:18.810 --> 41:21.301
what your, uh,
fall from grace might do to them?

41:21.600 --> 41:23.090
How they might be bullied,

41:23.390 --> 41:26.518
pursued by the media,
shamed on all fronts?

41:28.230 --> 41:29.219
Oh, yeah.

41:29.730 --> 41:30.936
And Michael.

41:33.570 --> 41:34.639
Uh-oh.

41:34.910 --> 41:35.945
Don't bring him into this.

41:36.110 --> 41:37.987
Oh, he's so fragile already.

41:38.950 --> 41:41.282
Manic depression, barely treated.

41:41.620 --> 41:42.939
Oh, I know. I know.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.571
I know what it's like
to have a troubled son.

41:45.790 --> 41:47.075
- Stop.
- See?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.582
We share so much, you and I.

41:53.090 --> 41:54.921
That's why I thought it was, um,

41:55.090 --> 41:58.878
important to come and offer you
an easy solution.

42:01.770 --> 42:02.839
Which is?

42:03.930 --> 42:05.306
You're gonna kill yourself.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.767
- Right.
- It's so simple, you know.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.396
A powerful man,

42:11.610 --> 42:14.317
stressed by a life and a job
that simply overwhelmed him.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.390
You go out a tortured hero.
None of this comes to light.

42:16.950 --> 42:20.272
You better get the hell out of here.
I don't know what you're up to,

42:20.450 --> 42:22.611
but I can tell you right now
that I will never...

42:22.790 --> 42:25.156
Honestly? You want 'em
to see the real you?

42:26.250 --> 42:27.285
I don't care.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.030
Oh, well, that's just sad.

42:29.630 --> 42:33.293
Because a father's first responsibility
to their kids

42:33.460 --> 42:36.918
is to provide a beautiful lie
for them to live in.

42:46.270 --> 42:49.012
How much longer until the, uh,
system reboots?

42:51.820 --> 42:52.969
Two minutes, thirty.

42:55.360 --> 42:59.194
Well, make sure you get the fingerprints
and the gunpowder residue right.

43:00.030 --> 43:02.362
I guess you better hurry.

43:05.580 --> 43:07.320
Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.957
- And who the hell are these people?
- It's the Hand.

43:10.130 --> 43:11.495
What?

43:12.840 --> 43:14.705
Then we'll kill as many
as we can on our way out.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.125
Backup, two-man teams!

43:19.470 --> 43:21.290
Move it!

43:24.640 --> 43:26.301
- Over here!
- Stop!

44:05.100 --> 44:06.670
Sensei, what's going on?

44:06.850 --> 44:07.919
- It's Danny.
- What?

44:08.100 --> 44:09.169
Find him!

44:12.100 --> 44:14.398
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Move!

44:17.940 --> 44:20.022
Okay, we make it to the gate,
you summon the Fist,

44:20.200 --> 44:21.599
- knock it down. We're out.
- Right.

44:21.820 --> 44:22.900
We're gonna be seen, though.

44:23.070 --> 44:25.402
I can hold them off for a bit,
but we have to go quickly.

44:29.290 --> 44:31.451
Stealing apples from Master Q'uon
was harder.

44:32.210 --> 44:33.199
Ready?

44:33.380 --> 44:34.699
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.176
- Darryl.
- Who's this?

44:49.430 --> 44:52.809
- Get outta the way. This isn't your fight!
- I don't understand.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.015
The gate! Let's go! Move!

45:03.150 --> 45:06.233
No, no, no, forget him! Forget him.

45:06.490 --> 45:07.946
- To the gate.
- Darryl.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.827
The Fist! You have to use the Fist.
Knock down the gate.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.840
- Hold it!
- Danny, now!

45:30.010 --> 45:31.307
We're out of time.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.566
Block that area.

45:42.110 --> 45:44.647
Your anger, your hatred,

45:45.780 --> 45:46.815
your confusion...

45:47.820 --> 45:49.481
it's destroyed your chi.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.321
The Fist won't work.

45:52.950 --> 45:54.906
You cannot access it.

46:50.220 --> 46:51.710
This wasn't the plan.

46:59.770 --> 47:01.397
- Eric.
- Colleen.

47:02.730 --> 47:03.936
Please forgive me.

47:10.620 --> 47:11.609
Shit!

47:25.420 --> 47:27.581
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90!

47:28.930 --> 47:30.830
Close the gate!

47:35.430 --> 47:36.556
Come on!

47:39.940 --> 47:41.305
Come on. Come on.

47:53.450 --> 47:54.519
What?

47:58.620 --> 47:59.996
Keep moving! Keep moving.

48:43.210 --> 48:44.666
Did he get away?

48:49.170 --> 48:52.469
You did your best to stop him.
Just like I asked.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.346
You didn't kill him, did you?

48:55.510 --> 48:57.307
No. No.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.767
Killing Danny is the last thing we want.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.353
- Let's get him patched up.
- Come on.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.681
This young man is our future.

49:14.030 --> 49:15.019
Come on.

49:18.990 --> 49:22.369
It’s my sad duty
to inform you all that...

49:24.370 --> 49:27.282
Lawrence Wilkins committed suicide
last night.

49:29.340 --> 49:33.925
This is an emergency,
and Rand needs to respond accordingly.

49:34.260 --> 49:38.629
Now, we have been riddled with controversy
over the past few weeks.

49:38.810 --> 49:43.759
The Danny situation,
the firing of me and my brother...

49:45.060 --> 49:46.516
and now we have this.

49:46.730 --> 49:49.893
As soon as the news hits the airwaves,
our stock,

49:50.070 --> 49:51.640
which is already falling,

49:52.240 --> 49:54.856
will plummet even further.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.400
Unless...

49:58.490 --> 50:04.406
you see fit to reinstate the visionaries
that led Rand to historic profits.

50:05.460 --> 50:06.825
Right the ship.

50:07.920 --> 50:13.005
Show Wall Street and the world that
stability is being restored.

50:14.260 --> 50:17.002
Now, there will be whispers about
the why of Wilkins' death,

50:17.590 --> 50:21.299
but Rand should quiet those fears
with a show of strength.

50:22.970 --> 50:26.098
The Meachums will set things right.

50:28.440 --> 50:29.429
Now the truth is...

50:31.900 --> 50:33.106
...you need us.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.360
I move that we...

50:44.830 --> 50:46.366
reinstate the Meachums...

50:48.460 --> 50:50.121
and Mr Rand.

50:50.540 --> 50:51.666
I second the motion.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.989
All those in favour...

50:53.210 --> 50:54.450
Aye.

51:02.470 --> 51:03.459
To family.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.170
You did it, Joy. You really did it.

51:05.350 --> 51:07.978
I'm not sure I did anything.

51:09.020 --> 51:10.396
Oh, come on. You were essential.

51:13.780 --> 51:16.817
You know... I've been thinking.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.777
For a long time, I felt your presence.

51:24.370 --> 51:26.531
It gave me this sense of comfort.

51:27.870 --> 51:32.990
I thought it was just... my imagination,
uh, the wishful thinking of...

51:34.090 --> 51:35.751
of a daughter who missed her dad.

51:37.670 --> 51:39.331
Now I know it was something else.

51:40.510 --> 51:41.499
You were there...

51:42.430 --> 51:43.499
watching...

51:44.100 --> 51:45.920
manipulating, conspiring.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.636
No, Joy, it's not like that.

51:47.930 --> 51:48.976
But it is.

51:50.690 --> 51:51.896
And you know it.

51:55.690 --> 51:57.237
You remember the promise you made?

51:58.440 --> 52:00.692
No more lies. Complete honesty.

52:01.610 --> 52:05.728
Well, Dad, I need to know...

52:09.370 --> 52:10.860
Did you have Wilkins killed?

52:14.290 --> 52:16.372
Joy, I know the promise I made.

52:16.710 --> 52:18.371
And I'm a man of my word.

52:20.090 --> 52:21.079
No.

52:22.050 --> 52:26.054
I did not have Lawrence killed.

52:28.930 --> 52:30.420
Good.

52:31.390 --> 52:32.721
I'm glad to hear it.

52:34.110 --> 52:37.568
But I'm afraid to say there is someone
we are gonna have to destroy.

52:38.570 --> 52:40.026
His name is Bakuto.

53:05.090 --> 53:06.887
We have to stop.
They're not following.

53:06.970 --> 53:08.801
We won't be able to get you through
the airport like this.

53:08.930 --> 53:10.340
- We need to get you stitched up.
- Airport?

53:10.430 --> 53:11.636
We're going home, Danny.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.179
No.

53:14.350 --> 53:17.183
The way to K'un-Lun is open,
and you are not there to protect it.

53:17.690 --> 53:18.679
We're going back.

53:19.280 --> 53:23.023
Look,
I understand, but I can't just leave.

53:24.320 --> 53:25.776
You had no trouble leaving us.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.947
- That's not true.
- One day, you were just gone.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.440
Without a word.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.616
I kept waiting, Danny,
thinking you'd be back.

53:36.210 --> 53:37.450
What happened?

53:39.960 --> 53:41.370
I'm not sure I can explain.

53:41.550 --> 53:42.756
You owe me an answer.

53:44.180 --> 53:46.580
The people of K'un-Lun need to know
why they were abandoned.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.097
And what about the people here?

53:48.510 --> 53:50.341
The ones who were just trying to kill you?

53:52.390 --> 53:53.800
You have failed, Danny.

53:55.190 --> 53:56.896
Failed in every way.

53:57.770 --> 53:59.351
The Fist won't even ignite now.

54:00.400 --> 54:03.062
Our only chance may be to return
and submit to Lei Kung.

54:05.030 --> 54:07.521
And let's hope he can restore you,
because if not...

54:09.160 --> 54:10.479
I don't know what happens.
