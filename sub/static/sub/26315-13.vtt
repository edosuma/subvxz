WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:04.787
Previously onMom...You slept with Adam?

00:04.830 --> 00:06.745
We only did it, like...

00:06.789 --> 00:08.617
20 times.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.923
You never told me you
slept with this monkey.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.577
You porked my wife?!

00:12.621 --> 00:13.926
I wouldn't use that word.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.015
I would.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.147
You grabbed her ass?With both hands.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.367
You did "bad hand" on my woman?

00:19.410 --> 00:22.848
I have a drinking problem.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.328
Come here, brother.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.895
Oh, thanks.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.028
Man, you know,
I-I was just kidding.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.030
[grunts]

00:32.032 --> 00:36.079
You've been reading Cosmopolitan
again, haven't you?

00:36.123 --> 00:39.256
Don't know why
every man doesn't.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.911
I love you.I love you, too.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.914
My friend Mitch
is coming to town.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.482
What?I said I love you.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.962
Drunk Hollywood
douchebag Mitch?

00:50.006 --> 00:52.965
I know the last time he was here
things got a little bumpy...

00:53.009 --> 00:55.490
A little bumpy?
He hit on me and my daughter.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.101
He peed in three places
that weren't the bathroom.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.495
One of them
was our good salad bowl.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.236
But he's not the
same guy anymore.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.628
He sobered up, he
divorced Leanne,

01:03.672 --> 01:05.108
he's on a whole different path,

01:05.152 --> 01:07.241
and he just wants
some bro time.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.112
If you ever want
to have sex with me again,

01:09.156 --> 01:10.113
don't say "bro time."

01:10.157 --> 01:12.115
Fine.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.552
You see him.
Just keep him away from me.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.033
Actually...[groans]

01:17.077 --> 01:20.254
He just wants to apologize
to you and Christy.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.170
You son of a bitch.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.563
What?You waited to tell me this

01:25.607 --> 01:27.652
till after I had
a decent orgasm.

01:27.696 --> 01:31.265
Decent? You
practically levitated.

01:31.308 --> 01:34.311
Fine, it was a cascading series
of body tremors.

01:34.355 --> 01:38.141
Just like the article promised!
So, what do you say?

01:38.185 --> 01:41.405
Oh, no, this is way too big
a favor for just one go-around.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.841
[laughs]

01:42.885 --> 01:44.278
You're kidding, right?

01:44.321 --> 01:45.583
Nope.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.629
Seriously, why am I
still looking at your face?

01:50.197 --> 01:52.199
â™ª

02:11.783 --> 02:13.524
I can't believe you're letting
that animal back into our lives.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.700
Well, at least it's only
one animal this time.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.093
Leanne's out of the picture.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.095
I'm still kind of shocked
they got divorced.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
Really? I'm shocked
that marriage didn't end

02:21.184 --> 02:22.664
in a murder-suicide.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.666
Yeah, but they're kind of made
for each other.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.712
Like water parks and diarrhea.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.671
[door opens]ADAM: Hey, we're here.

02:29.714 --> 02:30.889
Ugh, I can't do this.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.543
I promised Adam five minutes,

02:32.587 --> 02:34.066
and then we can head
to the meeting.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.981
I got to stop wearing stuff
with handles.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.160
Bonnie, Christy.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.162
[chuckles]:
You remember Mitch.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.163
BOTH: Hey.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.991
Hey. Thank you for seeing me.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.297
Mm-hmm.Uh-huh.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.125
You might want to take that
as a win and leave.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
No. No, I got to do this.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.132
Christy, Bonnie...

02:56.176 --> 02:58.090
I owe you both an amends

02:58.134 --> 03:00.441
for the wreckage I
caused on my last visit.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.966
I hope that you can give me
another chance.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.707
[voice breaking]:
But if you can't...

03:05.750 --> 03:07.970
I totally understand.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.409
I cry so easily these days.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.196
What do you think?

03:16.239 --> 03:19.982
I think making an amends
like that is really painful.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.593
Keep going.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.030
I didn't understand...

03:25.074 --> 03:27.119
what an ass I was.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.818
Ooh, I like that.
Delve into that.

03:29.861 --> 03:33.125
I actually thought
my behavior was charming.

03:33.169 --> 03:36.259
That's alcoholic thinking
for you.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.740
Anyway, all I can do now

03:38.783 --> 03:42.134
is try to repair the damage.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.137
Damn it, that was really good.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.270
Hold on.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.927
Oh, crap. Real tears.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.235
BOTH: Forgiven.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.106
ADAM:
So,

03:57.149 --> 03:58.716
are we all kumbaya here?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.719
'Cause I'm gonna
show Mitch the bar

04:01.763 --> 04:03.199
while you two
go to your meeting.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245
Actually, buddy, I'm-I'm feeling
a little fragile.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.116
I could really use
a meeting right now.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.945
Do you mind if I tag along?

04:09.988 --> 04:12.164
Well?

04:12.208 --> 04:14.950
We're not really allowed
to say no.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.518
Stupid program.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.346
Come on.

04:19.389 --> 04:23.175
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you just got here.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.960
What happened to bro time?

04:25.003 --> 04:28.137
Hey, what'd I say about that?

04:28.180 --> 04:30.966
So, I'm directing this
movie in Dubrovnik,

04:31.009 --> 04:33.229
and everybody's looking
at me to steer the ship

04:33.273 --> 04:35.840
'cause, you know,
I'm the director.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.236
And all I can think is,
"I'm a fraud."

04:41.498 --> 04:43.761
"I'm a drunk. I'm a liar."

04:43.805 --> 04:45.807
You're safe here.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.288
I feel that.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.552
So, I start saying the prayer

04:51.595 --> 04:55.164
in my head, and...
I'll be darned

04:55.207 --> 04:58.385
if God didn't grant me
the serenity to call "action"

04:58.428 --> 05:01.301
and send the Harley
off the cliff,

05:01.344 --> 05:03.172
through the helicopter door,
out the other side,

05:03.215 --> 05:04.956
where it hit
a second helicopter,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.308
exploded, ball of fire,
dead bad guy,

05:08.351 --> 05:10.962
that's a wrap
and a Golden Globe nomination.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.355
Golden Globe?

05:12.399 --> 05:15.967
Well, if you believe
the buzz. Anyway,

05:16.011 --> 05:18.970
I'm just another drunk
trying to get through the day.

05:19.014 --> 05:22.713
Well, a drunk
who's a Hollywood director.

05:22.757 --> 05:27.327
Wow, lunch goes faster when
someone else does the talking.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.332
I don't know how you handle
the pressure of making a movie.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.117
I can barely deal
with work and school.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.989
If they ever stopped making
Red Bull, I'd be screwed.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.297
I actually won
three Red Bull Stunt Awards.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.039
But have you ever considered
meditating?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.954
I tried,

05:45.997 --> 05:50.045
but apparently my
mind craves anxiety.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.089
Well, it changed my life.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.526
It made me
a much better director.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.397
That's four.

05:54.441 --> 05:58.009
Ladies, I just...
I want to thank you

05:58.053 --> 05:59.837
for letting me
into the red tent.

05:59.881 --> 06:04.276
I-I've just been so raw
since Leanne and I split up.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.322
Yeah, now, what happened there?

06:06.366 --> 06:10.282
Well, I got sober,
and she couldn't do it.

06:10.326 --> 06:13.068
I love her,
but I had to let her go.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.899
Yeah, the road gets narrower,
but our life gets better.

06:19.988 --> 06:22.425
Thank you for that.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.472
We're all here for you.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.693
Oh.No, no,

06:29.737 --> 06:33.044
no, ladies, this one is on me.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.743
Finally. I've been waiting
for four years

06:35.786 --> 06:37.092
for somebody else to pick up...

06:37.135 --> 06:39.964
Hold the phone,
is that a black card?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.966
This? Oh, yeah.BONNIE:
Is it true

06:42.010 --> 06:43.054
you can buy a Ferrari
with that?

06:43.098 --> 06:45.100
It's almost rude
if you don't.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.323
Whoa.Right?

06:51.367 --> 06:53.151
You should shoot a movie here.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.458
I could be in it.
You know, I sing.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.723
I'm panning, and I'm loving.

06:59.767 --> 07:03.118
I'm panning,
and I'm loving.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.249
Ooh.

07:04.293 --> 07:07.165
Recast that guy.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.993
Come on, you like?It's fantastic.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.040
Where was this place when
my blood type was bourbon?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.999
I know. I would've been totally
sleeping with the bartender.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.610
Oh, wait, I am.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.527
So, how's business been?

07:20.570 --> 07:22.572
Let's just say that there are
three people in here,

07:22.616 --> 07:24.574
and I'm excited.I don't get it.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.184
This place
should be crushing it.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.491
It's got charm, character,

07:28.535 --> 07:31.102
an owner you feel
a little bit sorry for.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.846
I know. I keep telling him,
work the chair.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.457
You guys done?

07:37.500 --> 07:41.286
Never. Honestly, man, I love it.
I love it. It's great.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.245
Thanks. As soon as we start
turning a profit,

07:43.288 --> 07:44.638
I got big plans.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.030
I want to hear them,
but right now I got

07:46.074 --> 07:48.032
about a gallon
of iced tea in me.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.078
Right that way. It's the door
that says "hombres."

07:50.121 --> 07:52.907
Cool.Still not sure
I should've done that.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.128
So, you two seem
to be getting along.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.914
Well, yeah, he's sober now,
he kept his hands to himself,

07:59.957 --> 08:01.742
and he paid for lunch
with a black card.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.006
A black card.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.530
He does love
waving that thing around.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.010
Well, maybe he could
wave it at us

08:09.053 --> 08:10.272
and make our problems disappear.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.969
Seriously, if we want

08:12.013 --> 08:13.057
to take this bar
to the next level,

08:13.101 --> 08:14.363
we need an investor.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.930
I don't know.
Friends and business?

08:15.973 --> 08:18.236
That's as bad
as having "hombres" on the door.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.717
Oh, come on. He lives in L.A.,
so we'd never hear from him.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.197
He'd just send us money.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.373
It's the exact opposite
of having a child.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.114
MITCH:
Hey.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.986
You ever think of putting TVs
above the urinals?

08:29.030 --> 08:31.728
I have a buddy who produces
60-second TED Talks.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.425
Perfect for the average whiz.

08:33.469 --> 08:37.168
You go in with a full bladder,
you leave with a full mind.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.997
Look at that,
Mitch has ideas for the bar.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.609
If only we had money
to implement them.

08:42.652 --> 08:43.610
Bonnie.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.568
Are you looking for investors?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.091
I would never put you
in that position, buddy.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.137
What if I want to be
in that position?

08:49.180 --> 08:50.660
Yeah, what if he wants to?

08:51.748 --> 08:53.576
Are you sure about this, Mitch?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.839
100%. It's part
of the program.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.059
The program says
that you should invest in a bar?

08:58.102 --> 08:59.843
No, it says
be of service,

08:59.887 --> 09:01.932
help others,
get out of self.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.500
I'm your
best friend, man.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.199
Let me take
this ride with you.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.115
Damn it, Mitch. Thank you.

09:11.159 --> 09:14.118
Well, I'm gonna let you two
have some bro time.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.772
That's right.
That's back in.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.341
I'm gonna go work
on my mini TED talk.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.604
Topic: people who dress up
in spandex to ride their bike.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.214
Why can't I run them over?

09:24.302 --> 09:26.130
This is incredible!

09:26.174 --> 09:27.828
We're actually getting
to work together again.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.612
The boys are back!Yeah!

09:29.656 --> 09:31.309
You cool if I have
a beer to celebrate?

09:31.353 --> 09:33.616
I would be pissed
if you didn't.I got to hand it to you,

09:33.660 --> 09:36.445
you figuring out a way to get
Bonnie to not be mad at you--

09:36.488 --> 09:38.316
you do a TED Talk on that,
let me know.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.841
It's the magic
of being on the same path.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.146
[grunts]

09:42.190 --> 09:43.583
You're smoking weed?

09:43.626 --> 09:45.062
I thought you were sober.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.108
I am.

09:48.979 --> 09:52.069
California sober.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.157
That's a thing?

09:53.201 --> 09:54.768
It's totally a thing.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.770
I d-- I don't--
I don't drink at all.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.685
But how can you be sober
if you're smoking?

09:58.728 --> 10:01.557
So, uh, 20 grand enough
to get things rolling?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.167
Let me get you an ashtray.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.130
CHRISTY:
All right. Here we go.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.914
Quiet the mind.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.524
Yepper-dee-doo.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.700
Why did I say that?

10:13.743 --> 10:15.527
That's not a quiet mind.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.922
[sighs]
Okay, here we go.

10:18.966 --> 10:22.622
Ooh, can't forget that
eye appointment on Thursday.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.407
[groans]
Stop it.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.803
â™ª I come from a land
down under. â™ª

10:29.846 --> 10:32.414
Where the hell
did that come from?

10:32.457 --> 10:34.546
My knees hurt
when I sit like this.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.331
That's probably cancer.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.115
Can you get knee cancer?

10:38.159 --> 10:39.813
MAN:
Christy Plunkett,

10:39.856 --> 10:42.163
you are terrible at this.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.426
CHRISTY: That was my seventh
grade science teacher.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.036
What's he doing in here?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.647
MAN:
Oh, I never left.

10:48.865 --> 10:49.823
Great.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.172
I'm mentally ill,

10:51.215 --> 10:53.478
and I have knee cancer.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.177
Hey, check it out.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.961
I ordered a new sign,
and the guy mocked up

10:58.005 --> 10:59.571
what it's gonna look
like on the building.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.964
Ooh, a neon barrel.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.270
That'll really draw a crowd.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.575
Yeah, and look
at the negative space.

11:03.619 --> 11:04.707
It's my initials.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.056
I'm not getting that.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.492
What do you mean?
"A" for Adam,

11:07.536 --> 11:08.972
"J" for Janikowski.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.060
I see a penis.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.062
What? What?
No, it's clearly "A.J."

11:12.106 --> 11:13.890
Well, either way,
it'll draw a crowd.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.893
Maybe two slightly different
crowds.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.287
It's fun spending Mitch's money,
isn't it?

11:19.330 --> 11:21.855
You want fun? Wait'll I put
in those foamless beer taps.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.552
Ooh. And a new ice maker.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.771
Yeah, and two more
PayPoint systems.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.120
Yeah, and that necklace
we saw at the mall.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.295
Yeah-- W-Wait, what?

11:27.338 --> 11:30.167
Come on, you got a neon penis.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.735
It's Mitch's money.
But as soon as we get our own,

11:32.779 --> 11:36.173
you can get a much smaller
version of that same necklace.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.698
It's crazy.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.134
Last time he was here,

11:40.177 --> 11:42.136
he was so loaded,
he couldn't stand up.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.355
Now he's a new man.Mm-hmm.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.618
Getting clean gave me
a second chance in life,

11:46.662 --> 11:48.316
it's giving him a second chance,

11:48.359 --> 11:50.144
and now it's giving your bar
a second chance.

11:50.187 --> 11:53.364
That is the power of sobriety.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.672
Yay, sobriety.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.071
Adam's new sign
went up today.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.028
What do you see?

12:05.072 --> 12:06.769
Penis.Penis.

12:06.813 --> 12:07.770
A.J.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.293
Penis.

12:09.337 --> 12:12.079
We see what we want to see.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.734
I so want to see a penis.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.041
Not yours, Barry.
Keep moving.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.826
I was hoping Mitch was coming.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.132
I wanted to tell him
he inspired me to try meditating

12:22.176 --> 12:23.568
and I'm a new woman.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.353
20 minutes in the morning,
20 minutes at night,

12:25.396 --> 12:28.095
and I haven't had to go
to the shooting range once.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.879
Wait, what?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.881
You're meditating
and it's working?

12:31.925 --> 12:33.187
Yeah, easy-peasy.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.493
And you only hear
your own voice in your head?

12:35.537 --> 12:37.278
Well, who else's voice
would I be hearing?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.627
I don't know.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.151
Maybe your seventh grade teacher
you had a crush on

12:41.195 --> 12:43.197
until you saw him at
the grocery store with his wife

12:43.240 --> 12:44.894
and then you cried
for three weeks.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.591
Mr. Borger?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.593
I slept with that guy.
You weren't missing anything.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.250
The trick to meditating
is to develop a routine.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.166
After a 45-minute massage,
some chamomile tea,

12:56.210 --> 12:57.777
and a long soak
in the hot tub,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.126
I go to my meditation room,

12:59.169 --> 13:01.041
get on top of some of
my big floor pillows,

13:01.084 --> 13:03.217
and just doze off.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.392
That's not meditating.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.872
That's taking a nap.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.177
Oh, what do you know?

13:07.221 --> 13:08.396
You can't even do it.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.096
Look at this!

13:13.140 --> 13:14.271
It's packed!

13:14.315 --> 13:15.707
The new sign's
working, babe.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.709
The giant penis
in the sky!

13:17.753 --> 13:21.844
If you erect it,
they will come!

13:21.888 --> 13:25.152
This is for
my pappy!

13:25.195 --> 13:27.197
What's going on?Uh-oh.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.852
We may not have gotten
along on this Earth,

13:29.896 --> 13:32.072
but we'll be drinking buddies
in hell.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.901
To Pappy!OTHERS: To Pappy!

13:34.944 --> 13:36.206
Oh, my God, he's loaded.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.642
He relapsed.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.296
This is all my fault.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.386
What was I thinking, asking
him to invest in a bar?

13:42.430 --> 13:43.997
Hey, look!

13:44.040 --> 13:45.999
There's my bar partner.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.261
My bartner!

13:47.304 --> 13:49.219
What the hell
is going on, Mitch?

13:49.263 --> 13:52.135
Mm, I'm trying to hug you,
but it's-it's hard,

13:52.179 --> 13:53.310
'cause of the chair.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.703
How do you do it?

13:54.746 --> 13:56.096
Let's get you some coffee.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.706
Coffee?
[groans]

13:57.749 --> 13:59.882
Innkeeper!

13:59.926 --> 14:02.711
Work your alchemy!

14:02.754 --> 14:04.974
I met these guys
in the bar at my hotel.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.062
They all work in insurance.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.891
Can you imagine?
Kill me now.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.024
What happened
to California sober?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.155
"California sober"?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.113
You know, he gets high
but doesn't drink.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.549
That's not a thing.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.593
You told me
it was a thing.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.247
You knew it wasn't a thing.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.945
W... Wait,

14:18.988 --> 14:21.469
you knew he was smoking pot
and you didn't tell me?

14:21.512 --> 14:22.949
Well, by that time,
we were partners,

14:22.992 --> 14:25.125
and then I ordered
my penis sign.

14:25.168 --> 14:28.911
This is for
my old ma!

14:28.955 --> 14:30.913
May she rest in peace,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.610
whenever she dies.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.003
She's in a home.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.831
I can't go. It's too depressing.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.137
To Ma!

14:37.180 --> 14:39.095
OTHERS:
To Ma!

14:39.139 --> 14:41.141
CHRISTY:
Okay.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.012
Quiet the mind,

14:43.056 --> 14:46.320
quiet the mind.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.322
A peaceful lake.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.064
A gentle breeze.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.198
Is this it?

14:55.242 --> 14:57.200
Am I doing it?

14:57.244 --> 15:00.203
Look at me.
I'm doing it.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.510
Suck it, Jill.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.034
[rapid knocking]

15:05.078 --> 15:06.209
LEANNE:
Mitch!

15:06.253 --> 15:07.732
Bonnie!

15:07.776 --> 15:09.430
Bonnie's daughter!

15:09.473 --> 15:11.432
[knocking continues]

15:11.475 --> 15:13.956
And I'm no longer doing it.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.436
Hello?!

15:15.479 --> 15:17.133
Coming!

15:19.179 --> 15:21.094
Bonnie's daughter!

15:21.137 --> 15:25.054
Oh! I've missed you so much!

15:25.098 --> 15:26.055
You have?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.404
[chuckles]
Don't you remember?

15:27.448 --> 15:29.319
We were gonna stay in touch
and be friends.

15:29.363 --> 15:32.627
I texted you, like,
a million, jillion times.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.324
I never gave you my number.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.761
Oh.

15:36.805 --> 15:40.156
Must've been a different Teresa.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.636
How 'bout you let go of me now?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.246
Oh. Sorry.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.552
Sorry, Teresa.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.336
Oh!

15:46.380 --> 15:48.860
I got to be honest
with you,

15:48.904 --> 15:52.299
I've had a few drinks.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.691
Yes, I know.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.564
I think I got drunk
from our hug.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.394
Wouldn't it be great
if it worked that way?

16:00.437 --> 16:02.744
Anyway,

16:02.787 --> 16:06.400
thanks for coming over.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.184
You came over here.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.447
And please tell me
you didn't drive.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.580
No, no, I boobered.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.583
That's when you get in a cab and
you show the driver your boobs

16:15.626 --> 16:18.194
instead of paying.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.240
Where's Mitch?!

16:21.632 --> 16:23.243
He owes me money!

16:23.286 --> 16:26.072
And why are you sleeping
with him,

16:26.115 --> 16:27.595
you nasty skank?!

16:27.638 --> 16:29.379
Oh!

16:29.423 --> 16:30.990
How'd we get here?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.208
I told you!

16:32.252 --> 16:33.949
Boober!

16:35.516 --> 16:37.387
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.476
Sambuca makes me mean.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.088
You want some?

16:42.131 --> 16:43.306
Easy, easy.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.308
It's a $1,200 sweater.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.484
You were never sober,
were you?

16:47.528 --> 16:48.485
Sure, I was.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.487
When I was nine.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.359
You went to a meeting with us!

16:52.402 --> 16:53.925
Why'd you lie?

16:53.969 --> 16:56.363
I want you to like me.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.495
Is it working?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.804
Hey!

17:02.847 --> 17:05.459
Stanley Tucci gave me
this sweater!

17:05.502 --> 17:07.809
The Tooch!

17:07.852 --> 17:09.811
Larry said you didn't charge
any of those people

17:09.854 --> 17:11.160
for their drinks.
What are you doing?

17:11.204 --> 17:13.032
Listen to me, listen to me.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.381
[sputters]

17:14.424 --> 17:16.383
Listen to me.
[coughs]

17:16.426 --> 17:18.689
We're listening!I have an idea.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.301
I was in a bar in Prague,

17:21.344 --> 17:23.825
and they had hookers.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.220
And people seemed to like it.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.223
[patrons clamoring][glass shatters]

17:30.266 --> 17:32.312
Oh, great. My first brawl.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.357
I'm just saying,

17:34.401 --> 17:36.664
no one fights in a hooker bar.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.885
Mitch, you miserable prick!

17:40.929 --> 17:42.409
You broke my heart!

17:42.452 --> 17:43.801
That's not Mitch!

17:43.845 --> 17:44.846
I'm not Mitch.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.327
You're not Mitch.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.719
What's she doing here?

17:48.763 --> 17:50.330
She showed up at our apartment
looking for Mitch.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.635
I figured
if I brought her down here,

17:51.679 --> 17:53.550
she'd cease to be my problem.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.292
Forget about Mitch.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.946
I like you now.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.992
Everybody,
I like Not Mitch!

18:02.864 --> 18:04.387
And now she's his problem.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.173
Oh, I feel so safe here.

18:07.216 --> 18:10.132
What are we drinking?

18:10.176 --> 18:12.613
I can't believe
I fell for this again.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.049
Well, to be fair,

18:14.093 --> 18:16.530
I am a Hollywood-level liar.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.140
Well, I should know better,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.142
because I'm whatever's worse
than Hollywood.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.536
Nothing's worse than Hollywood.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.842
As much as I want
to strangle you right now,

18:24.886 --> 18:26.975
I can't, because I amyou.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.759
Well, I wasyou.

18:28.803 --> 18:32.154
A drunk tornado
ripping through people's lives.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.331
They wanted me
to direct Sharknado 3.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.767
Shut up!

18:36.811 --> 18:40.162
I'm taking the high road,
you toxic cesspool!

18:41.207 --> 18:42.382
[exhales]

18:42.425 --> 18:44.384
[inhales deeply]

18:47.561 --> 18:49.563
What I meant to say was...

18:51.391 --> 18:53.219
...as long as you're drinking,

18:53.262 --> 18:55.351
I don't want you in our lives.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.876
No calling, no e-mailing,
no texting.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.357
What about Chapsnatch?

19:01.401 --> 19:04.360
Nothing. No contact.

19:04.404 --> 19:09.365
But if you
ever sincerely want help...

19:09.409 --> 19:11.889
I'll be here for you.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.241
Ah.
[chuckles]

19:15.284 --> 19:18.505
I see where this is going.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.465
Who's a pretty pony?

19:23.814 --> 19:26.208
[sputters]

19:26.252 --> 19:27.644
Adam.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.430
[grunting]

19:30.473 --> 19:33.433
You were always
the good one.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.175
Why'd I stop sleeping
with you?

19:36.218 --> 19:37.480
What happened
to us?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.656
Give her a minute.
She'll come back.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.441
What's yourname?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.314
Leanne, y-you got
to get off me.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.490
My fiancÃ©e has a temper.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.796
Adam!

19:48.839 --> 19:51.233
Bonnie hit me!

19:51.277 --> 19:53.409
See?

19:53.453 --> 19:54.715
Mitch!

19:54.758 --> 19:57.283
Leanne?!

19:57.326 --> 19:59.807
Why'd she hit you?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.461
No reason.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.724
Seriously? We should
all be hitting him.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.379
You poor thing.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.207
I know, right?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.252
I miss you.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.689
I love you.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.735
I love you, too.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.998
[grunts]

20:17.041 --> 20:18.565
Let's make a baby.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.393
It's true love.[grunts]

20:22.569 --> 20:25.963
What's wrong with me
that I'm jealous of them?

20:26.007 --> 20:28.488
[moaning]

20:33.971 --> 20:37.061
Cosmopolitan, you've done it again.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.411
Believe it or not,
this time,

20:38.454 --> 20:40.500
Redbook.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.284
Really?Yep.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.853
Right next to an article
about one-pot winter meals.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.290
[laughing]

20:48.334 --> 20:50.074
I love you.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.293
I love you, too.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.295
Mitch's check bounced.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.950
Go again.
