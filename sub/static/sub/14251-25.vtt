00:14.777 --> 00:16.438
Lieutenant, Ensign.

00:16.512 --> 00:17.536
Hey, Seven.

00:17.613 --> 00:18.807
Have some dinner.

00:18.881 --> 00:21.042
The potato salad isn't half bad.

00:21.117 --> 00:23.881
l do not require nutrition
at this time.

00:23.953 --> 00:26.080
l would like to talk with you.

00:26.155 --> 00:27.247
Okay.

00:27.323 --> 00:29.848
Ensign Kim, what is
your place of origin?

00:29.925 --> 00:31.187
You mean where am l from.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.160
Well, l was born
in South Carolina...

00:33.229 --> 00:34.719
Lieutenant Torres, explain

00:34.830 --> 00:36.889
why you became a member
of the Maquis.

00:36.966 --> 00:38.729
Um, it was through Chakotay.

00:38.801 --> 00:40.063
l met him...

00:40.136 --> 00:42.161
Well, actually,
he saved my life.

00:42.238 --> 00:43.535
List the sports you play.

00:43.606 --> 00:46.905
l've dabbled in quite a few--
tennis, parrises squares...

00:46.976 --> 00:48.841
but my favorite is volleyball.
lt's...

00:48.911 --> 00:51.209
Specify the foods
you find enjoyable.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.214
Seven, what is this?

00:53.282 --> 00:55.682
Describe the nature
of your sexual relationship

00:55.751 --> 00:56.877
with Lieutenant Paris.

00:56.952 --> 00:58.544
Okay, that's it.

00:58.621 --> 01:00.020
Computer, freeze program.

01:00.089 --> 01:02.683
Would you care to explain
what you're doing?

01:02.792 --> 01:05.352
l'm doing exactly
what you instructed me to do.

01:05.428 --> 01:06.690
l hardly think so.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.889
l created this program
to help you become

01:08.964 --> 01:10.989
more comfortable
in social situations,

01:11.067 --> 01:12.898
not to practice
alienating people.

01:12.968 --> 01:14.094
You made recommendations

01:14.170 --> 01:15.865
about how to carry on
a conversation.

01:15.938 --> 01:16.802
That's true.

01:16.872 --> 01:17.930
You said it's helpful if people

01:18.007 --> 01:19.167
feel you're interested
in them...

01:19.241 --> 01:20.173
Correct.

01:20.242 --> 01:21.174
...and that drawing them out

01:21.243 --> 01:22.403
by asking them
about themselves

01:22.478 --> 01:24.070
is one way to demonstrate
that interest.

01:24.146 --> 01:26.842
That doesn't mean subjecting
them to an interrogation.

01:26.916 --> 01:28.281
You have to let them answer.

01:28.351 --> 01:29.818
Listen to what they're saying.

01:29.885 --> 01:31.910
Ask another question
on the same subject.

01:31.987 --> 01:33.716
Take your time.

01:33.856 --> 01:34.914
Shall we try again?

01:34.990 --> 01:36.287
l believe l am overdue

01:36.359 --> 01:38.122
for my weekly
medical maintenance.

01:38.194 --> 01:39.718
We should go.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.263
Seven, you've never volunteered
for a checkup before.

01:42.331 --> 01:44.663
lt is preferable
to remaining here.

01:53.142 --> 01:54.473
What have we got here?

01:54.543 --> 01:56.101
Looks like
a Mutara- class nebula

01:56.178 --> 01:59.011
with a few trace constituents
that aren't in our database,

01:59.081 --> 02:01.276
but they're showing up
in minute quantities.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.045
The nebula is vast, Captain.

02:03.119 --> 02:04.950
lt extends beyond the reach
of our sensors.

02:05.020 --> 02:07.420
Huh. Then l guess we
won't try to go around it.

02:07.490 --> 02:10.357
Tom, take us in
at one- half impulse.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.155
Yes, ma'am.

02:12.228 --> 02:14.162
l'm detecting
a slight radioactive field.

02:14.230 --> 02:15.322
lt's...

02:19.568 --> 02:20.728
Harry?

02:22.004 --> 02:23.471
Nothing. Uh...

02:23.539 --> 02:26.099
it's just a headache coming on.

02:26.175 --> 02:27.699
Maybe you should
go to Sick Bay.

02:27.843 --> 02:28.832
Yeah, maybe so.

02:30.179 --> 02:31.043
Captain!

02:38.354 --> 02:39.844
Oh, God!

02:45.161 --> 02:47.391
Oh...

04:38.841 --> 04:41.401
Tom, turn us around.

04:41.477 --> 04:43.411
Get us out of here.

04:48.751 --> 04:49.445
Janeway to Sick Bay.

04:49.518 --> 04:50.507
Yes, Captain.

04:50.586 --> 04:51.109
We need help.

04:51.186 --> 04:52.153
What happened?

04:52.221 --> 04:54.052
l'm being inundated with calls!

04:54.123 --> 04:55.181
Hurry!

04:55.257 --> 04:56.224
Seven, go to the Bridge.

04:56.292 --> 04:58.260
Use the dermal regenerator
to treat the burns.

05:12.975 --> 05:14.272
Course laid in.

05:22.685 --> 05:25.176
We've cleared the nebula.

05:30.225 --> 05:31.715
All stop.

05:43.105 --> 05:46.165
He's dead.

05:49.745 --> 05:53.203
The nebula extends for at least
1 10 light- years, possibly more.

05:53.282 --> 05:55.307
At the least it would take us

05:55.384 --> 05:57.614
well over a month
to get through it

05:57.686 --> 06:00.177
and more than a year
to get around it.

06:00.255 --> 06:02.985
The crew was unable
to tolerate the nebula

06:03.058 --> 06:04.548
for even a few minutes.

06:04.627 --> 06:07.289
They certainly
could not survive a month.

06:07.363 --> 06:09.297
We've come 15, 000 light- years.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.334
We haven't been stopped
by temporal anomalies,

06:12.401 --> 06:14.665
warp- core breaches
or hostile aliens,

06:14.803 --> 06:18.364
and l am damned if l'm going
to be stopped by a nebula.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.034
l'll be in Sick Bay.

06:23.479 --> 06:26.107
l've analyzed a sample
of the gases from the nebula.

06:26.181 --> 06:28.911
l think the damage came
from subnucleonic radiation.

06:28.984 --> 06:30.315
Even the briefest exposure

06:30.386 --> 06:32.354
is devastating
to organic tissue.

06:32.421 --> 06:34.685
Can you give us any protection
against the effects?

06:34.757 --> 06:38.693
Yes. Stasis chambers--
independent life support

06:38.761 --> 06:40.661
for each unit.

06:40.729 --> 06:42.390
Are you suggesting...

06:42.464 --> 06:45.956
that the entire crew be put
in suspended animation?

06:46.035 --> 06:47.263
Yes.

06:47.336 --> 06:48.701
l, of course,
would stay on line

06:48.771 --> 06:50.102
in order to monitor everyone.

06:50.172 --> 06:52.106
Well, this is a
drastic step, Doctor.

06:52.174 --> 06:53.698
Are there any other options--

06:53.776 --> 06:55.710
adjusting the shields,
inoculations?

06:55.811 --> 06:57.574
l assure you, l've considered
all possibilities.

06:57.646 --> 06:58.806
This is the only way.

07:00.215 --> 07:02.183
There's more to getting
through the nebula

07:02.251 --> 07:03.582
than monitoring the crew.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.450
Who would regulate ship systems,
make course adjustments?

07:06.522 --> 07:09.923
l think l've demonstrated
that l have a command

07:09.992 --> 07:12.085
of the rudimentary aspects
of piloting.

07:12.161 --> 07:14.994
Of course you have,
and l know that you could do it,

07:15.064 --> 07:16.326
but you'll need backup.

07:16.398 --> 07:17.865
We have no idea what effect

07:17.933 --> 07:20.663
the nebula radiation might
have on your holo- matrix.

07:20.803 --> 07:22.168
What if you went off- line?

07:22.237 --> 07:24.865
There was only one crew member
besides myself

07:24.940 --> 07:27.135
that seemed unaffected
by the nebula.

07:27.209 --> 07:29.677
l want you to understand
the seriousness

07:29.812 --> 07:31.473
of this responsibility.

07:31.547 --> 07:35.608
The lives of the entire crew
will be on your shoulders.

07:35.684 --> 07:38.175
You doubt my ability
to fulfill this task.

07:38.253 --> 07:39.584
Ordinarily, not at all,

07:39.655 --> 07:41.714
but this is
an unusual situation.

07:44.026 --> 07:46.221
After being in the collective...

07:48.430 --> 07:50.694
it wasn't easy for you
to adjust to a ship

07:50.833 --> 07:53.893
with only 150 people
on it, was it, Seven?

07:53.969 --> 07:55.266
How would you feel

07:55.337 --> 07:57.498
with only the Doctor
for company?

07:57.573 --> 07:58.904
l will adapt.

07:58.974 --> 08:01.670
Most humans don't react
particularly well

08:01.744 --> 08:03.405
to long periods of isolation.

08:03.479 --> 08:05.640
Borg drones have
even more difficulty.

08:05.748 --> 08:10.310
As you pointed out,
l am neither human nor Borg.

08:12.988 --> 08:15.513
l can do this, Captain.

08:17.259 --> 08:19.625
All right.

08:19.695 --> 08:20.957
l'll work with my senior staff

08:21.029 --> 08:23.827
to draw up a list of duties,
but let me make it clear.

08:23.899 --> 08:25.628
The Doctor will be in command.

08:25.701 --> 08:28.966
You will follow his instructions
just as you would follow mine.

08:29.037 --> 08:30.902
Follow the orders of a hologram.

08:30.973 --> 08:33.032
He's our Chief Medical Officer,

08:33.107 --> 08:35.668
and he is thoroughly grounded
in Starfleet protocols.

08:35.811 --> 08:37.711
You will report to him.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.347
l understand.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.693
The Doctor's preparing
the stasis units now.

08:52.795 --> 08:55.025
They should be ready
by 1700 hours.

08:55.097 --> 08:58.362
And...
how long will this be for?

08:58.433 --> 08:59.866
We don't know for certain.

08:59.935 --> 09:01.095
At least a month,

09:01.170 --> 09:04.469
maybe longer if the nebula
is larger than we estimate.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.633
l've never been
in long- term stasis.

09:06.742 --> 09:08.334
Are there any side effects?

09:08.410 --> 09:10.901
The Doctor assures me
it'll be just like taking a nap.

09:10.979 --> 09:12.241
We'll go into the units;

09:12.314 --> 09:14.475
our cardiopulmonary systems
will be slowed;

09:14.550 --> 09:17.246
neural activity suspended;
and we'll wake up feeling

09:17.319 --> 09:19.116
as though we'd had
a good night's sleep.

09:19.188 --> 09:20.780
There are things
that can go wrong.

09:20.856 --> 09:22.187
At least,
that's what l've read.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.383
We will be carefully

09:23.458 --> 09:25.653
monitored by Seven
and the Doctor,

09:25.727 --> 09:27.558
who will check our vital signs
four times a day

09:27.629 --> 09:29.187
and take care of
any other problems.

09:30.399 --> 09:33.857
l assume that we've explored
all the alternatives.

09:35.204 --> 09:37.832
l think we're all feeling uneasy
about this,

09:37.906 --> 09:40.807
and l'd be lying if l said
l don't have concerns myself,

09:40.876 --> 09:42.810
and l think
it's about loss of control.

09:42.878 --> 09:45.369
We always feel better
if we think we're in charge

09:45.447 --> 09:47.210
of our own circumstances.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.046
ln stasis,
we're giving up that control

09:50.118 --> 09:52.985
and no Starfleet officer
likes to do that.

09:53.055 --> 09:56.582
But crews have been in stasis
much longer than a month.

09:56.658 --> 09:58.421
l think we can handle this.

09:58.493 --> 09:59.551
All right?

09:59.628 --> 10:01.687
You're free until 1700 hours.

10:01.763 --> 10:02.889
l'll make
a shipwide announcement

10:02.965 --> 10:03.954
when the Doctor's ready.

10:04.032 --> 10:05.021
Dismissed.

10:09.838 --> 10:11.772
Something else?

10:13.041 --> 10:15.100
l want you to tell me
that this isn't a mistake.

10:15.177 --> 10:16.974
Your turn to get reassurance?

10:17.045 --> 10:20.173
Maybe. But my concern
isn't about going into stasis.

10:20.249 --> 10:22.649
lt's about who you're leaving
in charge.

10:22.718 --> 10:24.413
You're worried about Seven.

10:24.486 --> 10:27.114
Maybe you need to step outside
yourself for a minute.

10:27.189 --> 10:28.918
Look at the fact
that here's someone

10:28.991 --> 10:30.288
who's butted horns with you

10:30.359 --> 10:31.986
from the moment
she came on board;

10:32.060 --> 10:34.722
who disregards authority
and actively disobeys orders

10:34.796 --> 10:35.888
when she doesn't agree
with them.

10:35.964 --> 10:37.727
And this is the person
l'm giving responsibility

10:37.833 --> 10:40.825
for the lives
of this entire crew.

10:40.903 --> 10:43.838
l suppose you want me
to tell you l'm not crazy.

10:43.906 --> 10:45.271
ln a nutshell.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.832
l know your bond
with Seven is unique;

10:48.911 --> 10:50.572
different from everyone else's.

10:50.646 --> 10:52.944
From the beginning,
you've seen things in her

10:53.015 --> 10:54.277
that no one else could.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.374
But maybe you
could help me understand

10:56.451 --> 10:57.383
some of those things.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.384
l don't know if l can.

10:58.453 --> 10:59.852
lt's just instinct.

10:59.922 --> 11:01.583
There's something
inside me that says

11:01.657 --> 11:03.284
she can be redeemed.

11:03.358 --> 11:07.419
ln spite of her
insolent attitude,

11:07.496 --> 11:11.023
l honestly believe she
wants to do well by us.

11:14.469 --> 11:16.164
That's good enough for me.

11:16.238 --> 11:19.002
See you at 1700 hours.

11:24.146 --> 11:26.944
lf l have to take a nap
for a month,

11:27.015 --> 11:29.711
l really would rather
do it in my quarters.

11:29.785 --> 11:32.447
Everyone's being relocated
here to Deck 14,

11:32.521 --> 11:34.648
so we can monitor you
more easily.

11:34.723 --> 11:36.714
Hop in.

11:36.792 --> 11:37.816
Come on, Tom.

11:37.893 --> 11:39.121
Sleepy time.

11:39.194 --> 11:42.493
What if we...
had to get out in a hurry?

11:42.564 --> 11:45.829
You can unlock the
unit from inside, Tom.

11:45.901 --> 11:49.735
Do l detect a hint
of claustrophobia, Lieutenant?

11:49.838 --> 11:54.207
Why do they have to design
these things like coffins?

11:54.276 --> 11:56.540
Should we replicate you
a teddy bear?

11:56.611 --> 11:58.943
Sleep tight.

12:04.086 --> 12:06.850
Have no worries, Captain.

12:06.922 --> 12:09.254
You'll go to sleep,
and the next thing you know,

12:09.324 --> 12:10.348
l'll be standing over you,

12:10.425 --> 12:12.655
telling you
we're through the nebula.

12:12.728 --> 12:15.219
l'm leaving this ship
in good hands.

12:15.297 --> 12:17.390
l have every confidence
in both of you.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.801
See you in a month.

12:32.848 --> 12:36.147
Well, it's just
the two of us now.

12:47.996 --> 12:52.695
Personal Log, Seven of Nine,
Stardate 51929. 3.

12:52.768 --> 12:54.065
This is the tenth day

12:54.136 --> 12:56.502
of our journey
through the Mutara nebula.

12:56.571 --> 12:59.597
l have created
an efficient daily routine.

13:08.884 --> 13:11.944
Nutritional supplement
14- beta- 7.

14:07.609 --> 14:11.443
Computer, adjust heading
by. 347 degrees starboard.

14:11.513 --> 14:13.481
Course adjusted.

14:24.993 --> 14:26.790
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.

14:26.862 --> 14:27.794
Go ahead.

14:27.863 --> 14:30.058
Lieutenant Paris
has left his stasis unit

14:30.132 --> 14:31.156
and is unconscious.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.700
l'll be right there.

14:33.969 --> 14:36.665
Apparently, he's more
claustrophobic than l thought.

14:36.738 --> 14:39.605
But he doesn't seem to have
suffered any ill effects.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.335
ls this likely
to happen again?

14:41.409 --> 14:43.206
lt's not unheard of
for people to come

14:43.278 --> 14:45.405
out of stasis
and start wandering.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.072
Leave it to Mr. Paris to be

14:47.149 --> 14:49.413
just as much trouble
now as when he's awake.

14:49.484 --> 14:50.917
You knew this might happen.

14:50.986 --> 14:52.317
Why complain about it?

14:52.387 --> 14:54.548
lf you had even the
slightest sense of humor,

14:54.623 --> 14:56.716
you'd realize l was
making a small joke.

14:56.858 --> 14:58.883
Very small.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.621
Give me his vital signs.

15:00.695 --> 15:01.787
Please.

15:07.536 --> 15:09.231
Pulse 42.

15:09.304 --> 15:11.329
Body temperature 97. 6.

15:11.406 --> 15:13.431
Blood pressure 100/50.

15:13.508 --> 15:15.066
Good.

15:15.143 --> 15:16.508
l will continue on my rounds.

15:16.578 --> 15:17.567
l think not.

15:17.646 --> 15:19.341
We're paying a visit
to the holodeck.

15:19.414 --> 15:22.042
l have no time
for frivolous pursuits.

15:22.117 --> 15:24.142
This isn't frivolous;
it's essential.

15:24.219 --> 15:27.188
You've been getting more
irritable and short- tempered

15:27.255 --> 15:28.916
- with each passing day.
- So have you.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.617
That's only because l'm
having to put up with you.

15:30.692 --> 15:32.887
l think you need a
little brush- up course

15:32.961 --> 15:34.690
in how to get along with people.

15:34.763 --> 15:37.459
There is no one here
to get along with.

15:37.532 --> 15:38.692
l'm here.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.495
This isn't a suggestion,
and it's not a request.

15:41.570 --> 15:42.559
lt's an order.

15:50.078 --> 15:51.375
Try one, Commander.

15:51.446 --> 15:53.437
Thank you, Neelix.

15:53.515 --> 15:54.539
Captain?

15:54.616 --> 15:55.913
Ooh, thank you.

15:55.984 --> 15:57.451
What have we here?

15:57.519 --> 15:58.611
Delicious.

16:03.692 --> 16:06.217
Join the party, Seven.

16:06.294 --> 16:08.854
lt's no fun to stand there
by yourself.

16:08.930 --> 16:11.228
l have no desire to have fun.

16:11.299 --> 16:12.231
No?

16:12.300 --> 16:15.167
l'm attempting to recalibrate
the warp field,

16:15.237 --> 16:18.468
in order to resist
the nebula's radiation.

16:18.540 --> 16:22.374
l understand you have some
knowledge of warp field theory.

16:22.444 --> 16:24.742
Perhaps you could assist me.

16:27.449 --> 16:29.383
l'd be happy to give it a try.

16:29.451 --> 16:31.214
Let's see...

16:31.286 --> 16:34.483
the subspace field matrix
looks right...

16:34.556 --> 16:35.488
Captain?

16:35.557 --> 16:37.115
Excuse me a minute.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.955
Perhaps you could help,
as well.

16:39.027 --> 16:40.551
We're attempting to find

16:40.629 --> 16:42.494
a stronger warp
field calibration.

16:42.564 --> 16:44.088
How interesting.

16:44.165 --> 16:47.100
Maybe if we vary
the EM stress parameters,

16:47.168 --> 16:49.932
the warp field dynamic
would increase.

16:50.005 --> 16:51.802
Excellent idea, Captain.

16:51.873 --> 16:54.103
And if the warp coils
were re- phased,

16:54.175 --> 16:56.700
it would increase power
to the nacelles.

16:56.845 --> 16:58.039
There is an additional problem.

16:58.113 --> 16:59.375
We must compensate

16:59.447 --> 17:01.779
for a subspace induction
drag on the engines.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.977
Pardon me, Captain, Mr. Neelix.

17:04.051 --> 17:06.417
Computer, freeze program.

17:07.922 --> 17:09.752
You're completely
missing the point

17:09.824 --> 17:10.983
of this exercise.

17:11.059 --> 17:12.651
You're supposed to be
mixing and mingling,

17:12.761 --> 17:15.127
not working on
engineering problems.

17:15.195 --> 17:17.221
You ordered me to participate
in this program.

17:17.299 --> 17:19.425
You did not specify topics
of conversation.

17:19.501 --> 17:20.661
You're splitting hairs.

17:20.734 --> 17:21.666
You know very well
what purpose

17:21.803 --> 17:23.498
this program is
supposed to serve.

17:23.570 --> 17:25.664
l find that it serves
no purpose whatsoever.

17:25.807 --> 17:27.569
Because you're being
intentionally perverse.

17:27.642 --> 17:29.405
Holodecks are
a pointless endeavor

17:29.477 --> 17:31.570
fulfilling some human need
to fantasize.

17:31.646 --> 17:33.079
l have no such need.

17:33.148 --> 17:35.173
What you need is
some editorial skill

17:35.250 --> 17:36.774
in your self- expression.

17:36.851 --> 17:39.115
Between impulse and
action, there is a realm

17:39.187 --> 17:41.485
of good taste begging
for your acquaintance.

17:41.556 --> 17:44.024
l find your self- expression
ponderous.

17:44.092 --> 17:45.992
And l can't put up with
this for another month.

17:46.061 --> 17:47.688
We can arrange
to avoid one another.

17:47.829 --> 17:48.796
l wish it were that simple.

17:48.863 --> 17:50.330
Unfortunately, you
have to report to me

17:50.398 --> 17:52.229
four times a day, to keep me
informed about the crew.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.098
We can minimize those reports.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.262
Warning.

17:56.338 --> 17:58.431
Emergency procedures in effect.

17:58.506 --> 18:00.701
Computer, what is the nature
of the emergency?

18:00.842 --> 18:03.242
The antimatter storage tanks
are failing.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.954
A cascade effect is in progress.

18:15.023 --> 18:16.923
The warp field coils
are compromised,

18:16.991 --> 18:18.856
primary deuterium
tank is rupturing,

18:18.927 --> 18:20.360
and the plasma conduits
are ready to breach.

18:20.428 --> 18:21.554
This is awful.

18:21.629 --> 18:23.290
We have to eject
the antimatter tanks.

18:23.365 --> 18:25.128
We've got to coordinate
the effort.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.498
You go to Engineering;
l'll go to the Bridge.

18:35.543 --> 18:36.669
Doctor to Seven.

18:36.811 --> 18:37.573
Yes, Doctor.

18:37.645 --> 18:38.577
lt's worse than we thought.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.079
Engineering is flooded
with plasma.

18:40.148 --> 18:41.080
You'll never get in.

18:41.149 --> 18:42.411
l believe l can survive
long enough

18:42.484 --> 18:43.610
to eject the assembly.

18:43.685 --> 18:44.674
lt's too late!

18:44.786 --> 18:46.811
Sensors show plasma conduits
rupturing

18:46.888 --> 18:48.116
on Decks 7 and 13.

18:48.189 --> 18:49.383
l can do it.

18:51.559 --> 18:54.824
Seven! There's been another
plasma discharge in Engineering!

18:54.896 --> 18:56.591
The hull is breaching.
Get out!

18:58.666 --> 19:00.793
Seven, do you hear me?

19:04.005 --> 19:06.269
lt's all right, Doctor.

19:06.341 --> 19:08.309
False alarm.

19:17.085 --> 19:18.017
Look here.

19:18.086 --> 19:19.917
l think l've found the problem.

19:19.988 --> 19:22.650
There are malfunctions
in a number of neural gel packs.

19:22.724 --> 19:26.285
As a result, false readings
were fed to the sensors,

19:26.361 --> 19:28.420
which detected an emergency
when there was none.

19:28.496 --> 19:31.329
We must repair them.

19:31.399 --> 19:33.663
They seem to be
in sequence six- theta- nine.

19:33.735 --> 19:36.363
We'll need replacement packs
and a repair...

19:36.438 --> 19:37.632
repair kit.

19:40.775 --> 19:42.572
These tubes certainly
weren't designed

19:42.644 --> 19:44.942
with creature comfort
in mind.

19:45.013 --> 19:47.573
lt seems to me the shipbuilders
should've created a space

19:47.649 --> 19:48.911
in which one could walk upright.

19:48.983 --> 19:50.245
But they did not.

19:50.318 --> 19:51.842
lt doesn't help
to complain about it now.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.387
l'll complain if l want to.

19:53.455 --> 19:55.286
lt's comforting.

19:55.356 --> 19:56.823
We can access sequence

19:56.891 --> 19:58.950
six- theta- nine
from this junction.

20:09.003 --> 20:10.197
Odd.

20:10.271 --> 20:11.966
l've never seen this kind
of neural activity

20:12.040 --> 20:13.029
in the gel packs.

20:13.107 --> 20:14.165
ln what sense?

20:14.242 --> 20:16.710
The neurodes are discharging
in random bursts.

20:16.778 --> 20:19.542
l would imagine the nebular
activity is causing it.

20:19.614 --> 20:22.708
l'll take this back
to Sick Bay for further study.

20:22.784 --> 20:23.978
l will reroute
the command processors

20:24.052 --> 20:26.213
to bypass this series.

20:28.289 --> 20:30.519
This journey certainly
hasn't lacked excitement.

20:30.592 --> 20:32.150
l can't complain
about being bored.

20:32.227 --> 20:34.491
Since you find it comforting,
you'll undoubtedly

20:34.562 --> 20:36.393
find something else
to complain about.

20:37.966 --> 20:38.898
No doubt.

20:38.967 --> 20:39.956
You really should try it.

20:41.836 --> 20:42.734
What's happening?

20:42.837 --> 20:44.099
My...My program is degrading.

20:44.172 --> 20:45.161
The mobile emitter?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.172
l don't know.

20:46.241 --> 20:47.731
l have to get back to Sick Bay.

20:47.876 --> 20:48.934
Hurry!

20:49.010 --> 20:50.068
l am hurrying.

20:50.144 --> 20:51.372
lf the mobile emitter
goes off- line

20:51.446 --> 20:53.505
while l'm out of Sick Bay,
my program may be irretrievable!

20:53.581 --> 20:55.139
Don't panic.
lt's counterproductive.

20:55.216 --> 20:56.308
That's easy for you to say.

20:56.384 --> 20:57.908
You're not facing
cybernetic oblivion.

21:04.058 --> 21:04.990
Doctor...

21:05.059 --> 21:06.720
lf that happens again,
l'm a goner.

21:16.804 --> 21:18.795
Home, sweet Sick Bay.

21:18.873 --> 21:22.070
l never thought l'd be so glad
to see these walls.

21:22.143 --> 21:24.202
Give me the emitter.

21:29.951 --> 21:32.579
The electro- optic
modulator is damaged.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.519
You're right.
lt's worthless.

21:34.589 --> 21:35.920
There's no way l can
risk using it now.

21:35.990 --> 21:36.979
l'm stuck here.

21:37.058 --> 21:39.720
The nebula is having
a deleterious effect

21:39.861 --> 21:41.260
on all the ship's technology.

21:41.329 --> 21:44.093
And we still have weeks to go.

21:44.165 --> 21:45.723
lt's up to you to keep
the ship running.

21:45.867 --> 21:48.131
We can't afford to break
down in this nebula.

21:52.206 --> 21:54.470
l won't disappoint you.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.825
0600 hours.

22:15.897 --> 22:18.161
Regeneration sequence complete.

22:26.107 --> 22:30.976
Personal Log, Seven of Nine,
Stardate 51932. 4.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.479
The 29th day
in the Mutara nebula.

22:34.949 --> 22:36.814
l believe l am beginning
to feel the effects

22:36.884 --> 22:39.375
of this prolonged isolation.

22:39.454 --> 22:41.615
My dreams have been...

22:41.689 --> 22:44.385
disturbing...

22:44.459 --> 22:47.917
but l am determined
to fulfill my responsibilities.

22:47.996 --> 22:49.224
With the Doctor confined
to Sick Bay,

22:49.297 --> 22:51.663
l have taken on
increasing duties.

22:51.733 --> 22:53.257
The ship's systems
are beginning to require

22:53.334 --> 22:56.326
constant maintenance
in order to avert disaster.

22:56.404 --> 23:00.966
This morning, l must purge
the auxiliary plasma vents.

23:01.042 --> 23:02.669
End log.

23:11.319 --> 23:13.981
Computer, trim heading
by. 31 degrees port.

23:15.256 --> 23:16.621
Computer, respond.

23:18.326 --> 23:22.353
Computer, trim heading
by. 31 degrees port.

23:22.430 --> 23:24.193
Attempting to make correction.

23:24.265 --> 23:26.028
Please stand by.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.001
Attempting to make correction.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.628
Unable to comply.

23:30.705 --> 23:32.172
Manual override.

23:36.344 --> 23:38.676
Computer, initiate
a level- 4 diagnostic

23:38.746 --> 23:40.270
of your command processors.

23:40.348 --> 23:42.714
Diagnostic in progress.

23:42.784 --> 23:44.581
Astrometrics.

23:44.652 --> 23:46.347
Diagnostic complete.

23:46.421 --> 23:48.446
Analyze.

23:48.523 --> 23:53.187
Quantum failures are present in
33 percent of gel pack relays.

23:53.261 --> 23:55.195
Reroute all functional relays

23:55.263 --> 23:57.595
through subprocessor
chi- one- four.

23:57.665 --> 24:00.065
Rerouting complete.

24:00.134 --> 24:03.228
Relay failures bypassed.

24:08.843 --> 24:11.971
Display Voyager's current
position within the nebula.

24:14.749 --> 24:17.684
How long to complete passage
through the nebula?

24:17.752 --> 24:19.686
Six days, five hours.

24:19.787 --> 24:21.118
Six days.

24:31.099 --> 24:32.930
Seven...

24:33.000 --> 24:34.991
help!

25:01.095 --> 25:02.585
Proximity alert.

25:02.663 --> 25:04.597
Vessel approaching.

25:04.665 --> 25:07.190
The vessel is hailing.

25:07.268 --> 25:09.031
Open a channel.

25:09.103 --> 25:10.536
Channel open.

25:10.605 --> 25:12.903
This is the Federation
Starship Voyager.

25:12.974 --> 25:14.202
State your identity.

25:14.275 --> 25:15.537
l'm Trajis Lo- Tarik.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.635
l'm in need
of a microfusion chamber.

25:17.712 --> 25:19.339
Would you consider a trade?

25:19.413 --> 25:21.074
Why are you in this nebula?

25:21.149 --> 25:24.084
Trying to get through it,
as l imagine you are.

25:24.152 --> 25:26.347
Do you have liquid helium?

25:26.420 --> 25:27.352
You're fortunate.

25:27.421 --> 25:29.150
l have an ample supply.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.384
l'll beam you directly
to our cargo bay.

25:31.459 --> 25:33.450
Seven of Nine--

25:33.528 --> 25:36.019
that's an unusual name.

25:36.097 --> 25:38.361
How did you get it?

25:38.432 --> 25:40.263
lt was my Borg designation.

25:40.334 --> 25:42.393
Borg?

25:42.470 --> 25:44.700
Never heard of them.

25:44.806 --> 25:48.071
Are you alone on this ship?

25:48.142 --> 25:50.610
No. The entire crew
is here in stasis

25:50.678 --> 25:52.509
and our Doctor is in Sick Bay.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.673
l'm both pilot and crew
on my ship.

25:54.749 --> 25:56.979
Fortunately, l happen
to be resistant

25:57.051 --> 25:59.576
to the effects of the nebula.

25:59.654 --> 26:01.781
What about your technology?

26:01.856 --> 26:04.086
The radiation is causing
damage to ours.

26:04.158 --> 26:08.060
l've had to rebuild
my engines twice already.

26:08.129 --> 26:11.223
lf you've been in the nebula
for three weeks,

26:11.299 --> 26:12.960
you're doing well.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.661
l am hopeful
our propulsion system

26:14.735 --> 26:17.295
will remain operational
for the next six days.

26:17.371 --> 26:18.668
l'll admit l was surprised

26:18.806 --> 26:21.866
to find another ship
headed toward me.

26:21.943 --> 26:24.673
No one has ever managed
to cross the nebula.

26:24.745 --> 26:27.509
lf it weren't necessary,
we wouldn't be attempting it.

26:27.582 --> 26:29.072
l'm here by choice.

26:29.150 --> 26:32.051
l'm determined to be
the first to get through.

26:32.119 --> 26:34.952
l've tried five times
before and failed,

26:35.022 --> 26:37.115
but this time
l'm sure l'll make it.

26:37.191 --> 26:39.853
l want to see
what's on the other side.

26:39.927 --> 26:41.417
lt is nothing remarkable.

26:41.495 --> 26:44.692
But l'll be the first
of my kind to see it.

26:44.832 --> 26:49.201
Tell me, how are you handling
the loneliness?

26:50.738 --> 26:52.103
What do you mean?

26:52.173 --> 26:53.470
You know what l mean.

26:53.541 --> 26:56.009
No matter what you say...

26:56.077 --> 26:58.739
you're all alone here.

27:05.186 --> 27:07.654
The microfusion chamber
you requested.

27:07.788 --> 27:10.814
l've heard the drones
can't stand being alone.

27:10.892 --> 27:13.156
They're too used
to the collective.

27:13.227 --> 27:15.058
How could you know that?

27:15.129 --> 27:17.324
lt's true, isn't it?

27:17.398 --> 27:19.764
You said you'd never
heard of the Borg.

27:19.834 --> 27:21.131
Don't be offended.

27:21.202 --> 27:23.329
l've no grudge with them.

27:25.206 --> 27:27.299
You have what you
asked for; now leave.

27:27.375 --> 27:30.811
l thought we could keep
each other company for awhile,

27:30.878 --> 27:32.675
maybe have something to eat.

27:32.747 --> 27:33.679
No.

27:33.748 --> 27:36.239
And if l want to stay longer?

27:37.852 --> 27:39.581
You will not be accommodated.

27:47.728 --> 27:49.025
There's no need
for this, you know.

27:49.096 --> 27:51.030
l mean you no harm.

27:51.098 --> 27:53.396
l think maybe
you're a little paranoid.

27:53.467 --> 27:56.061
That's what loneliness
can do to you.

27:56.137 --> 27:59.334
You'd be a lot better off
to spend some time with me.

27:59.407 --> 28:01.272
We could get to know each other.

28:01.342 --> 28:02.309
Quiet.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.900
Seven!

28:03.978 --> 28:05.206
Help me!

28:06.714 --> 28:07.544
Seven!

28:16.223 --> 28:18.657
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.

28:18.793 --> 28:20.818
We have an intruder on board.

28:26.467 --> 28:28.264
He must have a cloaking device.

28:28.336 --> 28:30.201
Sensors show
no alien life signs

28:30.271 --> 28:33.331
and no evidence of a ship.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.999
l've been working
on my mobile emitter.

28:35.076 --> 28:36.509
l think l'm making progress,

28:36.577 --> 28:39.205
but l still
can't leave Sick Bay.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.271
You'll have to try
to track him down.

28:41.349 --> 28:43.283
Arm yourself,
and use extreme caution.

28:43.351 --> 28:44.818
Warning.

28:44.885 --> 28:46.443
Deuterium tank levels

28:46.520 --> 28:49.887
are fluctuating
beyond acceptable tolerances.

28:49.957 --> 28:51.686
The computer sounds
like it needs a stimulant.

28:51.826 --> 28:53.885
lt has been experiencing
relay failures.

28:53.961 --> 28:56.896
l have not been performing
my maintenance duties.

28:56.964 --> 28:58.295
Do what you have to,

28:58.366 --> 29:00.266
but keep an eye out
for the alien.

29:00.334 --> 29:01.995
We have to assume
he's up to no good.

29:03.671 --> 29:06.435
Seven...

29:06.507 --> 29:08.873
are you...frightened?

29:11.145 --> 29:13.409
l am Borg.

29:44.645 --> 29:45.976
Who's there?

29:48.215 --> 29:49.546
Seven.

29:49.617 --> 29:50.914
Help me.

29:50.985 --> 29:52.816
Seven.

29:55.189 --> 29:57.157
l'm dying, Seven.

29:57.224 --> 29:59.215
Don't let me die.

29:59.293 --> 30:02.694
The lives of the crew
are on your shoulders.

30:06.100 --> 30:09.160
Seven, help me.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.867
Help, Seven.

30:14.942 --> 30:16.569
l need help.

30:16.644 --> 30:18.839
We need you, Seven.

30:23.984 --> 30:25.918
l'm dying, Seven.

31:01.055 --> 31:02.545
Seven of Nine.

31:02.623 --> 31:05.183
That's an unusual name.

31:05.259 --> 31:07.090
How did you get it?

31:08.362 --> 31:09.693
Don't want to answer me?

31:09.763 --> 31:11.458
That's all right.
l don't mind.

31:11.532 --> 31:13.557
l know you're
not yourself today.

31:13.634 --> 31:16.603
But you might be interested
in what l'm doing now.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.070
l know your sensors
can't detect me,

31:19.140 --> 31:22.598
so if you want to know where
l am, you'll have to ask.

31:24.078 --> 31:25.102
Playing stubborn?

31:25.179 --> 31:26.544
That's a mistake.

31:26.614 --> 31:29.708
lt could lead
to an unfortunate accident.

31:29.783 --> 31:32.081
Just to prove l'm willing
to give you a fair chance,

31:32.153 --> 31:34.246
l'll ask you: What would happen

31:34.321 --> 31:38.621
if the structural integrity
around the warp coils collapsed?

31:38.692 --> 31:42.958
You wouldn't have much time
to keep them from rupturing.

31:57.244 --> 32:00.577
l couldn't bring myself
to destroy your ship.

32:00.648 --> 32:03.674
l hope you're not
afraid of the dark.

32:03.784 --> 32:05.342
Where are you?

32:05.419 --> 32:07.319
Finally.
l'm glad you're responding.

32:07.388 --> 32:09.413
lt's going to be
much more interesting

32:09.490 --> 32:11.151
if we play this game together.

32:11.225 --> 32:13.159
Your location.

32:13.227 --> 32:15.695
A long way from you,
on the Bridge--

32:15.829 --> 32:18.127
command center of your ship,
l believe.

32:18.199 --> 32:20.497
l can do just about anything
from here.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.627
Seven! Help!

32:44.592 --> 32:45.616
Seven to Trajis.

32:45.693 --> 32:47.024
Are you still there?

32:47.094 --> 32:48.459
Of course.

32:48.529 --> 32:50.497
Do you think l'd leave now?

32:50.564 --> 32:52.259
l am enjoying this game.

32:52.333 --> 32:53.425
What's next?

32:53.500 --> 32:54.489
That's better.

32:54.568 --> 32:56.160
Well, let's just imagine

32:56.237 --> 32:59.365
that one of the photon torpedoes
was activated

32:59.440 --> 33:00.737
but not ejected.

33:00.808 --> 33:03.242
l would have to get
to the torpedo bay quickly.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.244
And even then,
you might be too late,

33:05.312 --> 33:07.007
but, of course, you have to try.

33:07.081 --> 33:08.309
Let's play another game.

33:08.382 --> 33:10.646
Let's imagine
that the oxygen on the Bridge

33:10.718 --> 33:11.650
has been depleted.

33:11.719 --> 33:12.686
What?

33:12.753 --> 33:14.584
What do you suppose
the results might be?

33:16.657 --> 33:19.251
Computer, seal the Bridge
with a level- 3 force field.

33:19.326 --> 33:21.385
Bridge sealed.

33:26.834 --> 33:28.563
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.

33:28.636 --> 33:29.660
l'm here.

33:29.737 --> 33:31.500
l have incapacitated the alien.

33:31.572 --> 33:33.267
He will not trouble us again.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.364
Good work.

33:34.441 --> 33:36.409
l have my mobile emitter
back on line.

33:36.477 --> 33:37.205
Where are you now?

33:37.278 --> 33:38.267
ln Engineering.

33:38.345 --> 33:39.369
l'll be right there.

33:39.446 --> 33:41.710
l have interesting news
about the neural gel packs.

33:41.782 --> 33:42.908
Acknowledged.

33:59.199 --> 34:01.667
ln your heart,
you knew you'd see me again.

34:03.337 --> 34:04.804
You can't defeat me.

34:04.872 --> 34:06.339
You're too weak.

34:08.175 --> 34:09.505
Don't come any closer.

34:09.576 --> 34:11.065
You couldn't stand being alone,
could you?

34:11.145 --> 34:13.579
You felt vulnerable, afraid,

34:13.647 --> 34:16.047
because you know
what you are.

34:16.116 --> 34:17.413
Stop.

34:17.484 --> 34:19.952
At first, you thought
you could become human,

34:20.020 --> 34:22.648
but now you know that's
impossible, don't you?

34:22.723 --> 34:24.953
You're Borg.

34:25.025 --> 34:27.391
That's what you're meant to be--

34:27.460 --> 34:28.951
one of many.

34:29.029 --> 34:31.690
But your days of power are gone.

34:31.831 --> 34:34.164
You're all alone now...

34:34.234 --> 34:37.101
weak, pathetic.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.105
Don't come any closer.
l'll kill you.

34:39.172 --> 34:40.333
Seven?

34:40.407 --> 34:41.806
Be careful, Doctor!
He's dangerous!

34:45.411 --> 34:47.243
Who are you talking to?

34:49.983 --> 34:52.213
Where did he go?

34:52.286 --> 34:53.685
There's no one else here.

34:53.754 --> 34:55.244
He was.
He was right here.

34:55.322 --> 34:56.652
Seven...

34:56.724 --> 34:58.157
you're hallucinating.

34:58.225 --> 34:59.658
No, l saw him!

34:59.727 --> 35:03.128
There was no one else
in this room.

35:05.699 --> 35:07.667
You mean l imagined him.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.393
Yes.

35:09.470 --> 35:11.904
l heard Lieutenant Paris
call for help.

35:11.972 --> 35:13.997
l saw him and the others.

35:15.642 --> 35:18.076
Did l imagine them, as well?

35:18.145 --> 35:19.544
l believe so.

35:19.613 --> 35:21.205
When l studied the gel pack,

35:21.281 --> 35:24.580
l discovered the radiation
was producing a degradation

35:24.651 --> 35:25.948
in the synaptic relays.

35:26.019 --> 35:28.613
l'm guessing there's
been a similar effect

35:28.689 --> 35:30.088
on your Borg implants.

35:30.157 --> 35:31.351
The radiation

35:31.425 --> 35:33.359
could be altering
the neurotransmitter levels

35:33.427 --> 35:35.952
in your sensory nodes.

35:36.029 --> 35:38.520
That would explain why
you're hearing voices...

35:38.599 --> 35:40.533
seeing images.

35:40.601 --> 35:42.228
But they seemed real.

35:42.302 --> 35:44.702
Hallucinations usually are.

35:44.772 --> 35:46.399
That's what makes
them so frightening.

35:52.079 --> 35:54.912
Once, when l was a drone...

35:54.982 --> 35:58.315
l was separated from
the collective for two hours.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.452
l experienced panic...

36:02.523 --> 36:04.150
and apprehension.

36:06.527 --> 36:09.928
l am feeling that way now.

36:09.997 --> 36:12.795
l'll do everything
l can to help you.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.299
We'll get you to Sick Bay.

36:14.368 --> 36:17.462
An anti- psychotic may help--
at least until l determine

36:17.538 --> 36:20.132
just what neural functions
are being affected.

36:20.207 --> 36:21.196
What was that?

36:21.275 --> 36:22.367
Warning.

36:22.443 --> 36:26.470
Primary EPS conduits
are overloading.

36:26.547 --> 36:28.879
l tied my mobile emitter
into the EPS conduits.

36:31.218 --> 36:33.618
Computer, access
the EPS conduits.

36:33.687 --> 36:35.086
Unable to comply.

36:35.155 --> 36:36.486
My program's going off- line.

36:36.557 --> 36:37.546
No!

36:37.624 --> 36:38.682
Warning.

36:38.759 --> 36:41.785
Primary EPS conduits
overloading.

36:41.862 --> 36:43.489
Secondary systems are failing.

36:43.564 --> 36:45.088
Seven, you've got to hang on.

36:45.165 --> 36:46.598
Repair the EPS conduits.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.259
Everything depends on you now.

36:48.335 --> 36:49.825
l cannot function alone.

36:49.903 --> 36:50.961
You have to.

36:51.038 --> 36:52.903
You're the only way
we can survive.

36:54.475 --> 36:56.443
No!

37:10.657 --> 37:13.626
Display Voyager's current
position within the nebula.

37:13.694 --> 37:15.059
lt doesn't matter.

37:15.128 --> 37:16.425
You won't make it.

37:17.998 --> 37:20.899
Computer, how long before
Voyager is out of the nebula?

37:20.968 --> 37:23.402
17 hours, 1 1 minutes.

37:23.470 --> 37:24.937
That's an eternity.

37:25.005 --> 37:26.666
Go away.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.868
You can try to shut me out,
but it won't work.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.069
Warning.

37:31.144 --> 37:34.409
Propulsion system failure
in progress.

37:49.263 --> 37:53.700
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.700
You have left the collective.

37:55.802 --> 37:57.429
lt was a foolish decision.

37:57.504 --> 37:58.698
Now you are alone.

37:58.839 --> 38:01.069
You have lost the many;
you are only one.

38:01.141 --> 38:05.805
You have become human,
weak, pathetic.

38:08.482 --> 38:10.211
Humans do not have
our strength.

38:10.284 --> 38:11.512
They are imperfect.

38:11.585 --> 38:12.984
Now you are imperfect as well.

38:13.053 --> 38:13.985
No.

38:14.054 --> 38:15.214
You will not survive.

38:15.289 --> 38:17.416
You cannot survive
without the collective.

38:17.491 --> 38:18.458
l will adapt.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.959
By becoming weaker,
less perfect.

38:21.028 --> 38:22.825
l will adapt as an individual.

38:22.896 --> 38:24.659
One. One alone.

38:24.731 --> 38:26.323
A Borg cannot be one.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.061
l will become stronger.

38:28.135 --> 38:29.659
A Borg cannot be one.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.931
She will die as one--

38:32.005 --> 38:34.940
weak, detached, isolated.

38:35.008 --> 38:37.340
One Borg cannot survive.

38:37.411 --> 38:39.003
l am an individual.

38:39.079 --> 38:40.512
l will survive alone.

38:40.581 --> 38:42.913
No. You are weak.

38:52.459 --> 38:53.653
You will die

38:53.727 --> 38:56.321
alone.

39:00.701 --> 39:03.499
He's right.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.629
You're in pain, Seven.

39:05.706 --> 39:07.901
l can help you.

39:07.975 --> 39:09.772
Bridge.

39:09.843 --> 39:11.868
You don't have to beg me.

39:11.945 --> 39:13.537
You don't even have to ask.

39:13.614 --> 39:16.481
All you have to do
is make a choice.

39:16.550 --> 39:18.609
l can survive alone.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.320
That's where you belong.

39:25.392 --> 39:26.916
No.

39:26.994 --> 39:29.189
End your pain.

39:29.262 --> 39:30.854
Just walk through that door,

39:30.931 --> 39:33.229
and you'll never be alone again.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.995
lt's not real.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.000
Seven of Nine,

39:36.069 --> 39:37.229
resistance is futile.

39:37.304 --> 39:39.101
Bridge!

39:47.481 --> 39:49.881
Seven of Nine.

39:49.950 --> 39:51.577
You look a little
worse for wear.

39:51.652 --> 39:53.347
l didn't know
she was still on board.

39:53.420 --> 39:54.944
l never wanted her here
in the first place.

39:55.022 --> 39:56.683
She won't be here long.

39:56.823 --> 39:58.120
She can't survive alone.

39:58.191 --> 40:00.386
l'm taking bets
on how long she'll last.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.690
She'll fall apart
before we leave the nebula.

40:02.796 --> 40:04.525
And then everybody will die.

40:04.598 --> 40:06.623
Well, blame me.
l put my trust in her.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.327
l should've known better.

40:08.402 --> 40:12.361
Warning. Propulsion system
failure in progress.

40:12.439 --> 40:14.907
What is she doing now?

40:14.975 --> 40:17.205
She's trying to keep
the engines on line.

40:17.277 --> 40:18.073
Place your bets.

40:18.145 --> 40:19.077
Anybody think she can do it?

40:19.146 --> 40:20.078
l'll lay odds she can't.

40:20.147 --> 40:21.375
Computer, how long until

40:21.448 --> 40:23.040
the ship is out of the nebula?

40:23.116 --> 40:24.310
41 minutes.

40:24.384 --> 40:25.715
Too long.
She won't make it.

40:25.852 --> 40:26.978
That's an eternity.

40:27.054 --> 40:29.022
Computer, reroute
available power from weapons,

40:29.089 --> 40:31.922
sensors and environmental
controls to the engines.

40:31.992 --> 40:33.721
Warning. Propulsion system
failure in progress.

40:33.794 --> 40:36.592
Reroute all available power
to the engines.

40:36.663 --> 40:38.597
Propulsion systems have failed.

40:38.665 --> 40:40.132
All engines are off- line.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.191
She's got herself
a real problem now.

40:42.269 --> 40:43.429
l'll say.

40:43.503 --> 40:45.733
She's taken power
from every available system,

40:45.872 --> 40:47.203
and it's still not enough.

40:47.274 --> 40:48.639
But if she fails
to get the ship moving,

40:48.709 --> 40:50.267
everyone on board will die.

40:50.343 --> 40:51.275
What do you think she'll do?

40:51.344 --> 40:52.333
l know what she's thinking.

40:52.412 --> 40:54.380
She's thinking
if she could take power

40:54.448 --> 40:57.440
from the stasis units
on Deck 14, she might be able

40:57.517 --> 40:59.610
to get those engines
back on line.

40:59.686 --> 41:01.745
But that would mean
sacrificing some of the crew.

41:01.822 --> 41:03.687
l don't think that would
bother her too much.

41:03.757 --> 41:05.588
What matters to Seven
is efficiency.

41:05.659 --> 41:08.924
Sacrificing a few to save many
would be an efficient plan.

41:08.995 --> 41:11.793
She's already killed millions;
would a few more matter?

41:11.865 --> 41:14.891
Computer, divert power from
stasis units 1 through 10,

41:14.968 --> 41:16.902
and reroute
to the propulsion systems.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.699
Engines are back on line.

41:18.772 --> 41:20.000
Resume course.

41:20.073 --> 41:22.439
Look at that.
She did it!

41:22.509 --> 41:24.272
But those people
she disconnected

41:24.344 --> 41:25.641
are going to die.

41:25.712 --> 41:27.976
l win. l knew she didn't
care about them.

41:35.789 --> 41:37.381
Come to watch them die?

41:39.726 --> 41:41.057
Warning.

41:41.128 --> 41:43.323
Power to stasis units
has failed.

41:43.396 --> 41:45.864
Computer, how long to complete
passage through the nebula?

41:45.932 --> 41:47.058
1 1 minutes.

41:47.134 --> 41:48.499
They won't last that long.

41:48.568 --> 41:50.729
What do you do now, Seven?

41:50.837 --> 41:52.202
lt's all up to you.

41:55.876 --> 41:57.844
Computer, cut life support
to all decks

41:57.911 --> 42:00.311
and reroute available power
to the stasis units.

42:00.380 --> 42:04.009
That will keep them alive,
but what about you?

42:04.084 --> 42:08.350
No oxygen, no heat.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.058
Good- bye, Seven.

42:19.633 --> 42:21.794
l am Seven of Nine.

42:24.304 --> 42:26.204
l am alone...

42:26.273 --> 42:28.264
but l will adapt.

42:31.244 --> 42:33.269
l will...

42:44.724 --> 42:46.954
She's coming to.

42:50.163 --> 42:51.357
Not so fast.

42:51.431 --> 42:53.626
Get your bearings first.

42:53.700 --> 42:54.826
The crew?

42:54.901 --> 42:57.995
We came through the nebula
in fine shape, thanks to you.

42:58.071 --> 42:59.629
You were the one
we almost lost.

42:59.706 --> 43:01.264
When the ship cleared
the nebula,

43:01.341 --> 43:04.139
the Doctor came back on line
and found you unconscious.

43:04.211 --> 43:06.543
He reinitiated life support
and woke the crew.

43:06.613 --> 43:08.672
He tells us you've had
quite an adventure.

43:08.815 --> 43:10.476
lt was...

43:12.285 --> 43:14.082
...interesting.

43:14.154 --> 43:17.419
Well, when you're rested,
l'd like to hear about it.

43:22.596 --> 43:24.325
l'm proud of you, Seven.

43:24.397 --> 43:26.991
You performed admirably.

43:27.067 --> 43:29.968
l am glad l was able to help.

43:35.108 --> 43:37.235
Neelix, this soup is great.

43:37.310 --> 43:38.675
What is it?

43:38.745 --> 43:40.474
lt's my secret recipe.

43:40.547 --> 43:41.673
l've never told anyone
what's in it.

43:41.748 --> 43:43.682
Why does that make me nervous?

43:43.750 --> 43:44.682
Oh, come on, Tom.

43:44.751 --> 43:45.718
Where's your sense of adventure?

43:45.852 --> 43:47.149
Not in my stomach.

43:47.220 --> 43:48.710
Food and mystery
don't go together.

43:48.788 --> 43:49.812
l like to know what l'm eating.

43:49.890 --> 43:51.482
Coward.

43:51.558 --> 43:53.685
Lieutenants Paris
and Torres, Ensign Kim.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.627
Seven. l'm surprised
to see you here.

43:56.696 --> 43:59.164
May l join you?

44:00.233 --> 44:01.495
Sure. Have a seat.

44:01.568 --> 44:02.762
Have some soup.

44:02.836 --> 44:04.201
lt's actually edible.

44:04.271 --> 44:08.037
l don't require nourishment
at this time.

44:08.108 --> 44:10.303
l...

44:10.377 --> 44:13.141
felt the need for companionship.

44:15.248 --> 44:18.081
Well, after a month
with only the Doc for company,

44:18.151 --> 44:19.243
l can understand it.

44:19.319 --> 44:21.685
Yeah. Uh, what was that like,
anyway--

44:21.821 --> 44:23.015
just the two of you?

44:23.089 --> 44:26.684
The Doctor was very helpful.
l cannot fault him.

44:26.826 --> 44:27.793
Well, we owe you one.

44:27.861 --> 44:28.793
Yeah.

44:28.862 --> 44:30.591
Just think,

44:30.664 --> 44:32.063
we could've died
in those coffins.

44:32.132 --> 44:34.396
l suspect you would've
found a way out

44:34.467 --> 44:35.456
before that, Lieutenant.

44:35.535 --> 44:36.866
What do you mean?

44:36.937 --> 44:39.098
Lieutenant Paris refused
to stay confined.

44:39.172 --> 44:41.697
On four separate occasions,
the Doctor and l

44:41.808 --> 44:43.867
had to put him back
into his stasis unit.

44:43.944 --> 44:46.640
Were you, um, locked
in dark closets

44:46.713 --> 44:48.704
or something as a child?

44:48.782 --> 44:51.410
l just don't like closed places.

44:51.484 --> 44:52.678
l never have.

44:52.752 --> 44:53.980
l don't know why.

44:54.054 --> 44:56.989
Perhaps you dislike being alone.
