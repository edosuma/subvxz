WEBVTT

00:32.950 --> 00:35.703
Couldn't stay away, huh?

00:35.745 --> 00:38.789
-Gabriela Lincoln, Jerry Edgar.
-Task force?

00:38.831 --> 00:41.000
She's IA, so watch your step.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.169
Didn't think you were
coming back until next week.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.628
He was shot, you know.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.297
Yeah, I think I heard
something like that.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.133
The man's a freak of nature.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.011
Apparently his brain is located
in his left shoulder.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.846
If it was me, man, I'd go visit

00:53.888 --> 00:55.931
every Triple-A baseball park
in the country,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.601
then get a big bed
in a big room up in Big Sur

00:58.642 --> 01:01.771
and go to fucking sleep
for about a year.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.648
Jimmy ever let you out
for fresh air, Pierce?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.567
Tell me about it.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.194
What are you doing here today?

01:08.235 --> 01:10.279
Had this weird craving
for K-Cup machine coffee.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.655
That's scary.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.032
Pierce.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.659
Where the fuck
is my briefcase warrant?

01:15.701 --> 01:16.869
Shit.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.662
Uh...

01:18.704 --> 01:21.457
I've got it right here.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.798
Can I help you?

01:28.839 --> 01:32.134
-Guy looks just like J. Edgar.
-No, can't be.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.762
The real J. Edgar's
on the beach somewhere.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.347
-PiÃ±a coladas.
-Mmm.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.808
Paid for with that
fat medical pension

01:38.849 --> 01:40.434
any sane individual
would have jumped on.

01:40.476 --> 01:41.852
Oh, man.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.270
Billets is acting captain,

01:43.312 --> 01:45.397
Bosch is running
his own task force...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.858
-Maybe it's opposite day.
-Where's my chair?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.693
We missed you, too, Jerry.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.362
J. Edgar?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.447
We made the same
mistake, Lieutenant.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.698
-Where's my chair?
-Wait.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.116
You're not due back till Monday.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.118
Figured I'd come in
at least a day early

01:58.160 --> 01:59.787
to find all my stuff.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.038
You're the captain?

02:01.080 --> 02:02.540
Oh, yeah.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.500
Until Cooper comes back
from his staycation.

02:04.542 --> 02:08.921
New TV.
It's a self-hostage situation.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.382
I'm serious.
Where's my chair?

03:54.485 --> 03:56.904
Yeah?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.322
Special Master just showed up.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.282
You better get back here.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.035
Detective.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.787
Ms. Chandler.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.330
When I got the call
to be Special Master

04:48.372 --> 04:50.749
and heard the lead detective
was you,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.668
-my heart leapt.
-I'll bet.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.004
-Can we get started?
-Not yet.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.714
Go get us some macchiatos.

04:56.755 --> 05:00.300
I'll need a few more minutes
to Bosch-proof the place.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.647
See if you can find
some of that coffee

05:13.689 --> 05:16.567
made from ground cat shit.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.851
- -

05:50.893 --> 05:52.436
- -

05:56.356 --> 05:57.649
- -

06:18.796 --> 06:22.466
You can take that one
with you-- low-hanging fruit.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.426
His other files will require
closer review.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.637
I'd like to get to Black
Guardian as soon as we can.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.347
Work product
from an active case?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.015
I don't think so.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.351
The very definition
of attorney-client privilege,

06:32.392 --> 06:33.852
and why I'm here.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.230
No, you're here to help me
catch a killer

06:36.271 --> 06:38.357
without giving someone
like yourself

06:38.398 --> 06:40.526
an easy way to get him off.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.574
So, what's your theory?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.743
Oh, that's how I do it.
I decide who's guilty,

06:49.785 --> 06:51.370
then I find what I need
to prove it.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.831
Isn't that how we got here

06:53.872 --> 06:55.874
That's the uncomplicated view.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.502
Oh, educate me, please.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.795
The case was an
active kidnapping

06:59.837 --> 07:01.421
when RHD caught it.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.549
They were trying to save
the life of a little girl.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.551
Harris' print was lifted
off a book

07:05.592 --> 07:07.469
found in the Kincaid
girl's room.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.471
He had a record, and he ran.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.141
You believe their story--
the man tortured himself?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.935
A big payday from the city.
People have done worse.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.563
-Internal Affairs cleared them.
-Oh.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.481
So anyone but a cop?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.276
This is productive.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.902
Did you know him?

07:23.944 --> 07:27.364
Howard? A bit.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.199
Sharks passing in the night.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.244
I respected him.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.829
He was difficult to like.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.456
Yeah

07:36.498 --> 07:39.293
More mercenary
than civil crusader.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.545
Oh, so, kindred spirits.

07:41.587 --> 07:45.007
Would it be fair to say
that going to trial for Elias--

07:45.048 --> 07:46.967
turning down a...
a big settlement--

07:47.009 --> 07:48.177
would be unusual?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.764
Okay, I'll play.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.517
I seriously doubt

07:55.559 --> 07:57.352
he would go to trial unless
he was confident

07:57.394 --> 07:58.854
he was going to win.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.856
So he had something.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.442
A witness. Evidence.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
Maybe he just has big
brass balls.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.614
I'm not asking what it is,
just if it exists.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.241
City attorney can
show you the discovery.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.577
That's as much as
you're gonna get from me.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.663
Where does Elias have
Harris stashed?

08:16.705 --> 08:19.333
That's a clever workaround.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.709
Go straight to the client.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.045
No confidentiality there.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.843
Far as I know,
he's at home.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.596
Someday you'll surprise me.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.690
That's my chair.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.025
I don't think so.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.278
-Stand, please.
-

09:29.319 --> 09:30.529
Well...

09:32.823 --> 09:35.617
Whoa!
How did that happen?

09:36.994 --> 09:40.872
Barrel did it.
Barrel did it.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.758
Are you kidding

09:51.800 --> 09:53.552
They're not gonna
audit themselves.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.178
Did you get everything back?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.264
Except somebody
ransacked my drawer.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.974
Oh, Jesus wept.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.560
-When do you meet with your
IOD coordinator? -Monday.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.479
Because that's when
I'm back, officially.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.273
Mm. Great,
Well, in the meantime,

10:06.315 --> 10:07.566
you can get started
on these.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.194
Fuck, I'm the house mouse now?

10:11.236 --> 10:13.030
You are my favorite
house mouse.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.532
It's good to have you back,
J. Edgar.

10:15.574 --> 10:16.825
Did you work things out
with Bosch?

10:16.867 --> 10:20.120
-Nothing to work out.
-Perfect.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.582
So, you disagree
with Ms. Chandler?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.252
Black Guardian?

10:27.294 --> 10:31.006
Sure you guys got it right?

10:31.048 --> 10:34.634
We investigated, we found
Harris' claim not sustained.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.678
Read the report.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.985
It's never going to work.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.362
He's been dead for too long.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.626
Give me that.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.379
If you're gonna break the law,
break it right.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.384
Now, it won't lock up
for another 12 hours.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.303
- -And you can
use it to chill out.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.347
If need be.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.024
The voicemail for this number

11:31.066 --> 11:33.276
is unavailable
or has not been set up.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.418
I didn't ask for this.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.544
Any of it.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.920
Ask for what?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.673
I'm a good cop,
trying to get better.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.676
I didn't ask to be assigned to
your stupid conduct unbecoming.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.428
I wrote you up
because you deserved it,

11:59.469 --> 12:01.847
and I'd do it again.
Sometimes you're an asshole.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.849
But I also think
you're a good detective.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.517
This going anywhere?

12:05.559 --> 12:06.893
And I'm not Lincoln.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.728
I'm no IA lifer.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.106
I want to make detective and get
the hell out of the oven.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.566
I thought, working on this case,
I could learn something

12:12.607 --> 12:13.984
with you,
but that's not gonna happen

12:14.025 --> 12:16.069
if you treat me
like a piece of shit.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.749
Okay. Let's say, for the moment,
I see your point.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.835
Tell me about Black Guardian.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.255
-I already said...
-But not the yearbook answer.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.718
Word of an ex-con
against four veteran RHD-threes.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.720
No witnesses, no cameras.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.263
There's only one way that goes.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.098
-You think they did it.
-I think a child's life

12:45.140 --> 12:47.142
was on the line, and they
thought they had the guy

12:47.184 --> 12:49.102
who knew where she was,
and he wasn't talking.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.481
I don't know if they did it.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.610
Okay, if. Which one?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.904
Drake, no question.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.615
More than his fair share
of citizen complaints.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.074
Guys like him
are the whole reason

13:03.116 --> 13:04.951
for the Christopher Commission.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.329
Look, bottom line,
they got the killer.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.332
Whatever works, right?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.591
Captain didn't say anything
about it. If I had known,

13:19.633 --> 13:20.717
-I would've...
-

13:20.759 --> 13:21.927
Come in.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.136
Uh, absolutely.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.346
Next year.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.765
I will.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.809
Runyon Canyon homeowners
had a fucking potluck,

13:29.851 --> 13:31.061
Cooper promised
to bring dessert.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.979
I need the keys
to the task force room.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.316
Chief's putting you on lockdown?

13:36.358 --> 13:39.027
-Worried about leaks.
-Leaks.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.821
Leaks are the least of it.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.325
He takes you, Robertson, Pierce,
leaves me shorthanded.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.036
Everything falls
on Crate and Barrel.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.663
Weight of the world.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.414
I asked Wilshire for help,
but they're short

13:51.456 --> 13:54.209
because Valley needed support
for that gang thing.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.211
Still processing the arrests.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.922
You wanted to be a captain.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.551
Just when I'm finally getting
okay with not making captain,

14:02.592 --> 14:04.386
I'm a fake captain,

14:04.427 --> 14:07.389
on a lieutenant's pay,
and it's worse.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.809
When's the last time you slept?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.061
Late '70s.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.862
J. Edgar.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.155
How's the shoulder?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.699
Harry.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.659
I thought that was you.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.494
Shoulder's fine.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.872
Good to hear.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.626
By the way,
Crate stole your chair.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.336
Yeah.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.380
I solved that.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.431
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.849
Commissioner Walker called.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.102
Wants an update on our progress.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.729
From me.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.897
In person, end of watch.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.775
Jesus. Hasn't even
been a day yet.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.569
And that address you texted,
for Michael Harris?

15:02.611 --> 15:03.695
Yeah, what about it?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.280
Well, place was empty.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.865
Neighbor said
he hasn't seen him in a week.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.284
Elias must've parked him
somewhere for the trial.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.369
I got to go back to Chandler.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.747
Well, Special Master be
special fucking with your head.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.957
Yeah, that ain't fresh news.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.500
Where's Pierce?

15:17.542 --> 15:20.337
Warrant for Elias's
Bunker Hill place.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.257
I think there was a woman there
last night, waiting for him.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.259
Not his wife?

15:26.301 --> 15:28.261
Bring a crim.

15:28.303 --> 15:32.390
Files about our RHD friends
on the dining table.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.684
Special Master material.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.311
Be sure not to look at them.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.980
Almost like you've been there.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.025
Sergeant Snyder.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.612
That arrest report you found at
the Bradbury for Martin Elias.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.696
Why don't you bring
that associate in

15:46.738 --> 15:47.822
and ask him about it?

15:49.574 --> 15:51.493
Absolutely. Yeah.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.870
Arrested for what?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.205
Possession.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.248
Mm. And Lincoln,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.417
call Central and Rampart
and request

15:59.459 --> 16:02.128
all the crime reports
for last night.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.464
Adios.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.757
Adios.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.717
Candlelight vigil,

16:07.759 --> 16:09.344
they don't have a permit.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.055
Social media buzz suggests
it could be 500 people.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.683
Or 50.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.227
Has anybody tried
to talk to the organizer?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.895
Spontaneous thing.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.730
No one we've been able
to pinpoint yet.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.608
Central Bureau provides squads
for crowd control.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.443
Metro will be on standby,
and Juvenile will maintain

16:25.485 --> 16:27.487
station security here at PAB.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.239
We can put some UCs
in the crowd.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.242
And have more officers
than actual citizens.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.744
I want a minimal
police presence.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.956
-Chief, if this thing blows...
-Be prepared to move with force.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.582
But let's not create a scenario

16:39.624 --> 16:42.252
where this becomes
a referendum on LAPD.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.962
People want to pay respects.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.172
Let them do so.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.717
It may help us down the line.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.017
I only found out Harris
was squirreled away

16:58.059 --> 16:59.185
after you left.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.063
My bad.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.273
Must have missed your call.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.816
Who's the detective here?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.152
He checked in
looking for Kaplan.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.486
I'm pretty sure
I'm only obligated

17:08.528 --> 17:09.904
to provide you
with what you ask for.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.740
Where's Harris?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.408
I'll go with.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.326
Otherwise, you won't get him
to open the door.

17:18.413 --> 17:23.084
Scraping a sharp pencil
across a man's temporal lobe

17:23.126 --> 17:25.253
can cause serious mood swings.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.756
Angling to take up
his cause, Counselor?

17:27.797 --> 17:29.340
It would be incredibly bad form

17:29.382 --> 17:31.342
for me to leverage
the advantage of my position.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.178
When did that ever
stop you before?

17:33.219 --> 17:36.347
I did find that Black Guardian
case notebook you asked about.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.932
Yeah

17:37.974 --> 17:42.145
Enough to know that it is
capital "P" privileged.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.522
But if it helps,
there's no smoking gun.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.940
At least, nothing
that would make me want

17:45.982 --> 17:48.193
to take this case to a jury.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.781
Oof. Some serious
flappage there.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.285
You leaving soon?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.370
Well, in theory, I'm not here.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.039
Why?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.833
There's are a few more warrants
I need to grind out,

18:03.875 --> 18:06.169
-but me and Jimmy need
to do a search... -Fine.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.420
I got your back.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.591
Harry doesn't trust
the IA people.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.967
No shit.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.177
Go.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.595
Thanks.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.683
Oh, hey.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.185
And don't you have that tech guy

18:22.227 --> 18:25.104
who can help expedite
phone stuff?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.402
We've been holed up here

18:31.444 --> 18:33.238
since the beginning
of voir dire.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.406
Elias paid two weeks in advance.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.617
So Elias thought the trial
would be one and done.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.202
Nice try.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.373
LAPD. Car stays here.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.582
Uh...

18:44.624 --> 18:45.834
Thank you.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.712
Let him see you first.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.885
Mr. Harris?

18:57.929 --> 19:01.891
Mr. Harris, it's Honey Chandler,
we spoke on the phone earlier.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.184
And I said I ain't talking.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.896
The fuck, man?
-Bosch. Homicide.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.481
I especially don't talk to cops.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.441
Not without a lawyer,
and mine's fucking dead.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.068
That's why I'm here, Mr. Harris.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.237
You even touch him again,
I'll call the judge.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.989
She's a lawyer
and an officer of the court.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.448
-She'll protect you.
-Yeah?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.367
And when's she gonna start?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.788
Man, cops killed Mr. Elias.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.373
And probably now
want to kill me, too.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.125
They won't let anyone
take this to trial.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.835
Why?

19:28.877 --> 19:31.296
Because my lawyer
was gonna prove what they did.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.715
Whole world was gonna know.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.508
Your lawyer tell you
how he was gonna do that?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.343
You don't have to answer that,
Mr. Harris.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.221
You're looking at
how he was gonna do it.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.931
Me.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.310
He was gonna put you
on the stand.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.562
Tell my tale.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.106
He called it my testi-money.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.442
You must be one
hell of a storyteller.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.570
The truth is always
the best story, lawyerman said.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.655
Truth is,

19:57.697 --> 20:01.784
cops came in that junkyard
like a pack of wolves.

20:01.826 --> 20:05.246
Take me to that storage room,
grill me hard, high heat.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.290
"Where is she "

20:07.332 --> 20:09.208
And I'm saying,
"I ain't do it, I ain't do it."

20:09.250 --> 20:11.252
I don't even know
what they talking about.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.921
Kidnap a little white girl?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.339
Come on, man. That ain't me.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.925
And they tortured you.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.551
Counselor, whose story is this?

20:18.593 --> 20:21.220
I have to piss, you know?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.473
After all that while.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.017
So they take me to the bathroom.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.227
Okay.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.687
I start in.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.439
They come in after. Boom.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.650
-Both of them

20:33.691 --> 20:35.652
I'm down, I'm cut.

20:35.693 --> 20:39.572
Blood in my eyes, and he's on me
with, like, a choke hold.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.450
Jamming my head
into the bowl, deep.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.994
I'm drowning in piss water.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.375
Plastic bag time.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.293
They sack my head like a melon,

20:52.335 --> 20:55.713
but real tight,
no air, no air at all.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.134
Here it comes.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.762
-A fucking nail in my ear.
-

21:02.804 --> 21:05.723
Pressing, pressing.
"You did it. Admit it.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.184
Tell us where she is."

21:10.937 --> 21:12.939
And then, the pain.

21:15.483 --> 21:19.237
I would've said anything
to stop it.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.947
I told them
I'd take them to her,

21:20.989 --> 21:22.991
just let me take out
that pencil,

21:23.032 --> 21:24.742
and we'd go save
that poor little girl.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.661
They let you take it out.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.705
Get my prints on it, you know.

21:36.045 --> 21:40.466
Give me a wad of paper towel,
and we drove.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.760
And drove.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.304
I said she was in the desert.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.516
I knew Barstow
was a couple hours.

21:48.558 --> 21:52.186
They drove, and I prayed.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.274
Then the call come in.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.653
Someone found the girl's body,
it'd just been dumped.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.321
By her dad.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.286
They released you.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.914
Motherfuckers dropped me off
at the urgent care on Fountain.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.833
Bullshit doc in a box.

22:13.875 --> 22:17.545
Band-Aid, couple of oxys, and
now it's my word against theirs.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.131
But Elias thought
you could win.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.467
He did.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.511
When's the last time
you talked to him?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.138
Come by yesterday morning.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.724
Said the city upped the number
to 420.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.559
I said, "Take it."

22:31.601 --> 22:34.854
But Mr. Elias said
that was chicken feed.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.981
A jury could give me
ten times that.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.359
You believed him.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.529
Mr. Elias believed me, man.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.531
Like, really believed me.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.326
Like he was there
when it happened.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.247
Now he's dead.

22:53.289 --> 22:57.001
And cops did it,
and I'm fucked.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.594
You think you could still
get me that 420?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.808
LAPD. Anyone home?

25:12.678 --> 25:13.930
Two spaces.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.265
Him and his wife...
and guest.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.935
She comes and goes.

25:18.976 --> 25:22.521
Can anyone come and go
without you knowing it?

25:22.563 --> 25:24.649
We got eyes on every egress.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.734
Do you keep records
of the license numbers

25:26.776 --> 25:28.277
authorized to park down below?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.613
Matter of fact, we do.

25:33.407 --> 25:34.742
He asked me to take care of it.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.869
Meaning what?

25:36.911 --> 25:39.497
-Make it go away?
-No.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.210
That was what he'd
always done in the past.

25:44.252 --> 25:47.797
Howard wanted his son to...

25:47.838 --> 25:50.007
bleed a bit this time.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.468
To learn a lesson.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.220
How did Martin take the news?

25:54.262 --> 25:57.223
Y-You know I can't
answer that.

26:02.937 --> 26:04.313
Why you?

26:05.690 --> 26:08.150
What do you mean?

26:08.192 --> 26:10.486
Your boss seemed to treat you
like a messenger.

26:10.528 --> 26:13.698
At least, from what I saw
on your desk.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.866
Glorified paralegal.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.832
Howard was a...

26:22.873 --> 26:24.959
was a one-man band.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.544
But he wouldn't have hired me

26:26.585 --> 26:28.296
if he didn't respect me
as a lawyer.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.131
He ever share strategy
with you?

26:33.467 --> 26:37.513
Because--
wondering aloud here--

26:37.555 --> 26:39.515
if he was willing to turn down

26:39.557 --> 26:42.518
the city's offer
for Black Guardian,

26:42.560 --> 26:44.812
maybe he had something
he knew a jury would

26:44.854 --> 26:48.441
give him a lot more money for
if he took it to trial.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.444
Magic bullet, you know.

26:53.404 --> 26:56.115
No, see, that's the thing.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.451
I don't know.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.579
One-man band, like I said.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.501
Hey.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.086
What did you say
to my client

27:09.128 --> 27:10.338
when you showed the house?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.256
Nothing. Why?

27:12.298 --> 27:14.425
I thought he was gonna
lowball me.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.469
He came in full price.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.929
You should do all my showings.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.222
Can we meet at my place?

27:20.264 --> 27:22.725
Uh, I've got some pizza.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.560
We can stream something
kid-friendly.

27:24.602 --> 27:27.104
Where are you?

27:27.146 --> 27:29.774
I had to come
straighten out my desk.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.442
Hollywood Station?

27:31.484 --> 27:32.568
Yeah. They stole my chair.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.779
Mm.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.031
How much longer
you think you'll be?

27:37.073 --> 27:39.909
Well, Pierce asked if I can

27:39.950 --> 27:42.536
help him with some paperwork
on the Elias murder.

27:42.578 --> 27:45.498
They got a task force going.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.083
I'm not on it.
They--

27:47.124 --> 27:50.211
They're shorthanded,
you know?

27:52.630 --> 27:54.423
30.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.592
They can do homework before.

27:56.634 --> 28:00.346
-Pepperoni?
-Hawaiian.

28:00.388 --> 28:03.057
30, J.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.267
Yeah.

28:14.777 --> 28:17.696
Pamela Duncan in?

28:17.738 --> 28:19.949
-Santiago Robertson, LAPD.
-Darling, I got it.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.034
What's going on?

28:22.076 --> 28:25.162
Uh, a few questions
about Howard Elias.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.289
She barely knew him.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.666
It's okay, Ben.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.545
Do you mind if we walk Monster?

28:32.586 --> 28:35.214
I waited for him to join me,

28:35.256 --> 28:37.425
and he just never showed up.

28:37.466 --> 28:40.469
I had to get home, obviously.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.766
And you went back and cleaned up
when you heard the news.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.935
The last thing Howard
and his family needed

28:47.977 --> 28:50.563
was to be dragged
through the tabloid swamp.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.440
Not to mention your career.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.484
How long?

28:55.526 --> 28:58.404
I've known Howard for years,

28:58.446 --> 29:01.115
but we only started
sleeping together

29:01.157 --> 29:03.659
when I signed onto the case.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.954
A man who loves to settle
worries about jurors?

29:06.996 --> 29:09.832
This one was different.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.500
Howard wanted the world
to know

29:11.542 --> 29:13.294
what those detectives did
to Michael Harris.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.796
Wasn't gonna let the city
bury this with a settlement,

29:15.838 --> 29:18.674
but wasn't gonna turn down a fat
check from the jury, either.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.260
No. He changed.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.890
The man got religion.

29:25.931 --> 29:29.727
Decided it was time
to do some good.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.063
For me, an attractive quality.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.317
Where was your husband
last night?

29:36.358 --> 29:38.444
On the red eye from New York.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.660
Do you think his wife
knew about you?

29:49.371 --> 29:52.416
Me, yes.
The fucking, no.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.379
But his son found out.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.548
How'd that go?

30:01.467 --> 30:04.803
Anonymous texts,

30:04.845 --> 30:08.724
vicious e-mails
from phony senders.

30:08.766 --> 30:12.645
The whole thing
blew up last week.

30:12.686 --> 30:17.274
Martin called his dad
a hypocrite to his face.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.860
The kid was pretty jacked up.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.153
Jacked up enough to kill him?

30:25.824 --> 30:28.994
How am I gonna keep this
from destroying my marriage?

30:30.913 --> 30:33.165
You're asking the wrong guy.

30:42.258 --> 30:46.053
How did you know
they had a secret menu?

30:46.095 --> 30:48.013
Mom, even Dad knows.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.308
I could make these.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.728
-I don't think so.
-

30:56.689 --> 30:57.648
Who was that guy
you were talking to?

30:57.690 --> 30:59.316
Mm.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.069
His daughter's
on the Balboa Eighteens.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.821
She's not playing very much,

31:03.862 --> 31:05.739
so they're thinking
of switching clubs.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.450
You know.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.244
Yeah, it's just, um...
sliced potatoes,

31:10.286 --> 31:11.620
onions, cheese.

31:11.662 --> 31:12.955
Throw it in the microwave,

31:12.997 --> 31:15.249
nuke it till
it looks like this...

31:15.291 --> 31:16.584
You should get a cooking show.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.669
I could definitely make these.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.004
You could definitely
ask Reggie to do it

31:20.045 --> 31:21.255
for you when he gets here.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.969
If, in fact, he's coming at all.

31:27.011 --> 31:29.471
Honey...

31:29.513 --> 31:31.056
Come on.
What can I say?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.558
How about the truth?

31:34.435 --> 31:37.021
The truth would be nice.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.064
Even a little bit of it.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.200
See you tomorrow.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.369
Tell Harry th...

31:57.166 --> 32:00.586
So, does the mistress-slash-
jury consultant have an alibi?

32:00.628 --> 32:02.546
Well, security puts her
in the apartment,

32:02.588 --> 32:04.465
but I doubt a woman
committed this crime.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.176
-Why not?
-Well, call it a hunch,

32:07.217 --> 32:10.262
but bullet up the ass
is tantamount to rape.

32:10.304 --> 32:11.972
I don't think a female
makes that statement.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.599
Duncan's story

32:13.641 --> 32:16.393
-about the son?
-Prior arrests, but none stuck.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.647
The associate claims dad
always intervened.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.815
Yeah, mistress seemed to think
Elias had some

32:21.857 --> 32:23.817
"come to Jesus"
thing going on.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.402
Came down hard on the kid.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.738
That's motive,
isn't it

32:27.780 --> 32:29.948
What else?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.743
Wallet is a dead end.
Credit cards, license,

32:32.785 --> 32:35.746
receipts, pictures of his wife,
loose change.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.748
Eh, pull the purchase records
anyway for the credit cards.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.583
You never know.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.669
J. Edgar's phone guy's
gonna help with turnaround

32:41.710 --> 32:44.922
on that number
that left the text for Elias.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.465
How are we doing
on his old cases?

32:46.507 --> 32:48.717
First batch, already got
about a half a dozen cops

32:48.759 --> 32:50.302
with plausible motive
to kill him.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.179
Clients?
-Nothing yet.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.640
-Clients loved him.
-Uh, we should keep our focus

32:54.682 --> 32:56.517
on our Black Guardian
detectives.

32:56.558 --> 33:00.479
Francis Sheehan was involved
in a OIS a few years back.

33:00.521 --> 33:02.606
I remember it came
up in our IA review.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.108
Well, find it.
And any others

33:04.149 --> 33:06.902
for the cops you got
on your short lists.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.239
I'm pulling all Terry Drake's
old use of force complaints.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.282
Could be something there.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.828
It goes where it goes.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.122
Drake knows the score.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.374
Okay. Everybody go home,
get some sleep.

33:20.416 --> 33:24.086
Tomorrow we pull in the RHD
boys, verify their alibis,

33:24.128 --> 33:26.088
cross 'em off the list.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.424
Or not.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.308
- -

33:38.350 --> 33:40.686
Jesus, watch where the fuck
you're going!

33:54.783 --> 33:57.119
Why am I even
talking to the L.A. Times?

33:57.161 --> 33:59.913
IA clears the RHD cops
on Black Guardian,

33:59.955 --> 34:01.582
it's page one, above the fold.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.167
We report the news, Ms. Zealy.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.793
Do you? Or do you just

34:04.835 --> 34:07.546
print whatever press release
the city hands out?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.965
So, in other words, you're doing
now exactly what you say

34:10.007 --> 34:12.926
the city's doing--
making prejudicial assumptions,

34:12.968 --> 34:15.637
-jumping to conclusions
without the facts. -No.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.890
It's just, if the police
try to cover this up,

34:17.931 --> 34:20.184
the community needs to respond,
and we will.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.103
Look, I'm here out of respect
to Howard Elias,

34:23.145 --> 34:25.647
-a man that dedicated his life
to justice. -Thank you.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.757
Harry Bosch.
I called ahead.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.759
Sure.
Come on in, Detective.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.803
I'll tell Mr. Walker
you're here.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.942
Lakers up by 11,
fourth quarter.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.444
Follow basketball?

35:12.486 --> 35:13.987
Not so much.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.367
Well, I'm sorry to make
your long day longer, Detective.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.619
I really only have
one question.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.204
Same one everyone's asking.

35:22.246 --> 35:24.373
I wanted to hear it from you.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.793
Out of earshot
of the department and City Hall,

35:27.835 --> 35:29.294
in case that factors.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.838
It doesn't.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.173
What do you think?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.050
Didn't you know him?

35:37.970 --> 35:39.930
you, the mayor, Elias.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.932
Well...

35:41.974 --> 35:43.934
like all of us,

35:43.976 --> 35:45.978
he had this city in his blood.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.314
Like you, I think.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.317
Like your father?

35:52.359 --> 35:55.112
My father bulldozed Bunker Hill

35:55.153 --> 35:57.489
so lawyers could have
an ocean view.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.492
His father destroyed
Chavez Ravine

36:00.534 --> 36:02.995
for low-cost housing
he knew would never happen.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.913
But you're better than that.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.500
That's not for me to judge.

36:08.542 --> 36:12.129
Was it a cop who killed Elias?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.132
Logical assumption.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.925
You have other suspects?

36:16.967 --> 36:18.552
Following all the leads.

36:18.594 --> 36:20.262
Ask the right questions,

36:20.304 --> 36:22.264
I have to believe...

36:22.306 --> 36:25.976
the answers
will get me to the truth.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.148
You know, that cold case

36:31.189 --> 36:33.191
you're working on...

36:35.277 --> 36:37.696
Can I be of any help?

36:39.948 --> 36:42.367
When I think you can,

36:42.409 --> 36:45.454
you can be sure
I'll reach out to you.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.596
Hello?

37:02.638 --> 37:04.806
Anyone home?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.725
Hello?

37:06.767 --> 37:09.519
Come on.
15 minutes?

37:13.190 --> 37:14.775
Guys?

37:14.816 --> 37:17.277
- -Hey!

37:17.319 --> 37:18.904
Okay... Aah!

37:18.946 --> 37:21.782
Ooh, Jesus,
you scared the hell out of me.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.408
That was the idea, I think.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.661
You really thought we'd left?

37:25.702 --> 37:26.954
Ah, plates,

37:26.995 --> 37:29.873
napkins, chop-chop.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.460
We wouldn't leave, Dad.
Not with pineapple pizza.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.962
Look at you.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.254
A comedian.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.298
- -

37:52.521 --> 37:54.856
Mom is an impossible human.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.358
Talk or text, Mads.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.026
We got third in our pool.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.487
Liz kept setting Emma,
who kept hitting it out.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.489
We lost our first
and last match.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.533
Mads, please.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.661
Thank you.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.749
Sorry I couldn't be there.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.876
Angel's Flight homicide.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.378
Becca's mom saw you on TV.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.797
#KilledByCops.
It's trending.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.341
Mmm. #Wrong.
Beginning stages.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.260
-Gathering information...
-I know.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.679
And then sifting.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.056
I asked Mom about Reggie.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.267
She won't talk about it.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.935
Mmm.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.937
Maybe she's trying
to figure it out herself.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.439
Did you eat?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.399
Was she like this
when you guys broke up?

38:40.110 --> 38:42.904
Wow, I... I don't remember.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.740
I mean, when you're
in it, it's...

38:44.781 --> 38:47.743
it's kind of hard
to see things clearly.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.453
You think they are splitting up?

38:49.494 --> 38:52.456
I know. Talk to her.
I tried.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.166
Then keep trying.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.587
Keep trying. Obviously.
I'm a Bosch, Dad.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.089
- -That's what we do.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.054
-You want some double-double?
-Oof. No.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.223
-I'm too tired to chew.
-It's still warm.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.642
And, unlike sushi, still good.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.186
There's fries inside.

40:14.704 --> 40:15.997
Oh.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.041
Game's this way.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.523
Eleanor.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.525
We were just about
to start without you.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.360
Good thing you didn't.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.237
Can't win 'em all when you don't
win the first one.

40:54.077 --> 40:57.664
Blinds are 500 and 1,000.
First ace deals.

41:01.585 --> 41:03.837
Beginner's luck.

41:55.305 --> 41:57.307
5,000 to you.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.064
Let's make it 20.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.280
Good hand.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.743
Game's over. I'm sorry.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.036
The game has to end.

42:18.078 --> 42:19.537
Huh?

42:19.579 --> 42:22.749
Are you kidding?
We paid for the whole night.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.668
I understand.
I will return your money.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.503
We paid for this room,

42:26.544 --> 42:28.380
and we're not leaving
until the game's over.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.006
I'm sorry.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.758
You're done here.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.176
-Please, please, come.
-Cash them out.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.011
Come, please, this way.
Cash them out.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.472
Please. Let's go,

42:37.514 --> 42:39.641
-please, please, hurry. Hurry.
-You missed your plane.

42:39.683 --> 42:42.852
Aren't there planes every day?

42:42.894 --> 42:44.521
I told him
but he wouldn't listen.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.528
Let me explain.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.582
Please, you must leave now.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.419
Uh... No, this way.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.087
I won't be a second.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.000
Eleanor.

43:47.042 --> 43:48.752
-Uh...
-What are you doing?

43:48.793 --> 43:50.253
You forgot your money.

43:50.295 --> 43:52.297
Thanks.
