00:02.921 --> 00:07.261
Nice, Julie! Keep your hands up.
Slide your feet. That's it, Teeger.

00:07.261 --> 00:11.623
Emily, you know when they set the screen,
that you have to get through it.

00:11.623 --> 00:13.031
Which Emily?

00:13.031 --> 00:14.738
All the Emilys.

00:14.738 --> 00:18.053
- All right, come on, girls, let's try it again.
- All right, you can do this.

00:24.016 --> 00:25.885
Like that, Coach Hayden?

00:25.885 --> 00:28.346
- Coach Hayden!
- Yes.

00:28.346 --> 00:29.982
That was much better.

00:29.982 --> 00:32.479
Okay, girls, let's huddle up.

00:32.753 --> 00:35.775
All right, one week to go.
This is it.

00:35.775 --> 00:38.864
- Do you feel like champions?
- Yeah.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.692
Well, you are champions.

00:40.692 --> 00:44.517
And you're always gonna be champions.
No matter who's coaching you.

00:44.517 --> 00:50.138
Okay, Monday, 3:30 practice.
Anyone's late, we're all doing laps.

00:50.138 --> 00:51.095
Oh, my gosh.

00:51.095 --> 00:53.286
All right, Cougars on three.

00:53.538 --> 00:55.911
One, two, three.
Cougars!

00:55.911 --> 00:58.329
All right, girls, hit the showers.

01:00.855 --> 01:02.658
- How you doing, Julie?
- Oh, I'm good.

01:02.658 --> 01:03.784
You're looking great out there.

01:03.784 --> 01:06.161
You're getting a lot more range
on your shots. / Thanks.

01:06.161 --> 01:10.062
Coach Hayden, what do you mean,
"no matter who's coaching you"?

01:10.062 --> 01:17.634
I just meant that you, the team, the girls,
are a lot more important than me.

01:17.634 --> 01:20.552
- Go on. Hit the showers.
- Bye.

01:36.259 --> 01:38.953
- See you Monday.
- See you coach.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.521
Hello?

04:28.395 --> 04:30.213
- Julie.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Monk.

04:30.213 --> 04:33.172
These are my friends,
Emily and Emily.

04:33.172 --> 04:37.241
We call them Emily C. and Emily J.

04:37.904 --> 04:40.646
I don't have any candy.

04:41.566 --> 04:43.540
Mr. Monk, it's not Halloween.

04:43.540 --> 04:47.970
- We... we really need you.
- We want to hire you.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.594
Is this a bad time?

04:56.594 --> 04:57.972
Yes, it is.

04:57.972 --> 05:01.916
- Should we come back?
- No, it's always a bad time.

05:01.916 --> 05:05.104
You iron your shoelaces?

05:05.104 --> 05:06.633
Why are there three?

05:06.633 --> 05:10.054
Right, left, backup.

05:10.054 --> 05:13.447
No, wait a second.
This is the backup.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.579
So, that's, uh, right, left...

05:16.579 --> 05:18.451
I... it doesn't matter.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.507
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

05:21.507 --> 05:22.962
Left... this is the right one.

05:22.962 --> 05:24.268
- Um, Mr. Monk?
- Yeah?

05:24.268 --> 05:28.776
You know, our coach, Miss
Hayden, died on Friday. / Oh, yeah.

05:28.776 --> 05:32.232
Your mother mentioned that.
I'm so sorry.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.697
Is there anything I can do?
That's your mother can't do?

05:35.697 --> 05:37.630
Well, the police said
it was an accident.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.630
I understand something was
blocking the drain, right?

05:40.630 --> 05:43.887
It was a towel. I was supposed
to put all the towels away.

05:43.887 --> 05:46.581
And... and I did, I know I did.
I checked everywhere.

05:46.581 --> 05:49.600
And it was my hairdryer that did it,
that electrocuted her,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.303
but I know I put it away.

05:52.303 --> 05:53.842
I mean, it was in my locker.

05:53.842 --> 05:57.035
Are you sure?
Maybe you forgot. / No.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.063
Julie.
Would you...

06:03.063 --> 06:06.067
Mr. Monk. Let it go.
Let it go.

06:06.067 --> 06:09.829
So... so... so you think somebody did
this to your coach on purpose?

06:09.829 --> 06:15.030
Yeah, and, like, no one takes us seriously
because, you know, we're just kids. / Yeah.

06:16.554 --> 06:19.282
- What do you want me to do?
- Mr. Monk, just do what you do.

06:19.282 --> 06:21.238
Mom says you're the greatest
detective in the world.

06:21.238 --> 06:22.977
- Maybe that ever lived.
- She might be right.

06:22.977 --> 06:25.856
- We... we'll pay you.
- We have $57.

06:25.856 --> 06:28.055
And, look, we know it's not
what you usually get.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.793
But it can count for me
as my birthday present.

06:29.793 --> 06:33.966
Here's the thing. I wasn't planning
to buy you a birthday present.

06:33.966 --> 06:35.718
Please.

06:37.004 --> 06:41.095
Yeah. Okay. Wait... fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

06:41.095 --> 06:43.183
I'll see what I can do.

06:43.183 --> 06:45.345
Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Monk.
You are such a nice person.

06:45.345 --> 06:46.538
Yeah, okay.

06:46.538 --> 06:50.011
- Hey, what are you guys doing?
- Oh! Hi, mom.

06:50.011 --> 06:53.414
Um, Mr. Monk is gonna help us find out
what really happened to Coach Hayden.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.876
Oh, girls.

06:54.876 --> 06:57.491
I know it's hard, but you gotta
remember it's not your fault,

06:57.491 --> 06:59.433
it was just an accident.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.906
Will you just wait out front
and I'll meet you there? / Okay.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.164
- Thank you, Mr. Monk!
- Thank you so much, Mr. Monk!

07:05.164 --> 07:07.847
Yeah, yeah.
Stay in school.

07:07.847 --> 07:10.038
Don't take dope.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.443
Oh, God.
Mr. Monk, what are we gonna do?

07:12.443 --> 07:14.995
- What do you mean?
- Can't you see it?

07:14.995 --> 07:18.812
They feel so terrible about what happened
they're just in complete denial.

07:18.812 --> 07:21.442
Well, they are offering to pay me $57.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.025
Okay, first of all, you're not
taking their money.

07:24.025 --> 07:26.113
So you want me to say no.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.596
Well, I don't know. You already said yes.
Maybe it's a good thing.

07:29.596 --> 07:32.262
You know, maybe... maybe it'll
give them closure.

07:32.262 --> 07:33.872
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.

07:33.872 --> 07:35.186
We're gonna look into it.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.459
And then we're gonna sit them down,
and we're gonna tell them...

07:37.459 --> 07:39.420
That it was all their fault.

07:39.420 --> 07:43.269
You know what? When it comes time
to tell them, maybe you shouldn't.

07:48.179 --> 07:50.975
They really loved her.

07:50.975 --> 07:52.314
How long was she here?

07:52.314 --> 07:54.208
Uh, I think seven years.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.262
She was the best coach
Julie ever had.

07:57.262 --> 07:58.904
Come on.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.362
This place makes me uncomfortable.

08:06.362 --> 08:07.955
Oh, Mr. Monk.
It's just a high school.

08:07.955 --> 08:11.372
Yeah, high school wasn't
the best year of my life.

08:11.372 --> 08:15.288
Oh, but look at theses.

08:15.288 --> 08:17.244
Amazing.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.610
Look at that one.
State champions.

08:19.610 --> 08:20.897
Okay, That's very nice.

08:20.897 --> 08:22.379
Yeah, yeah, look at this one.

08:22.379 --> 08:23.978
Yeah, they're all very nice.

08:23.978 --> 08:27.558
Yeah, look at that.
Look at this... these, these two.

08:27.558 --> 08:30.142
I could never believe that they
would just leave them sitting

08:30.142 --> 08:32.063
in the hallway right
next to the exit.

08:32.063 --> 08:35.360
I always felt they should be locked
away in a vault somewhere.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.918
Why? Who's gonna take a
bunch of old trophies?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.385
I don't know.

08:39.385 --> 08:43.706
Maybe somebody who's never
won anything in their whole life.

08:44.025 --> 08:47.634
Somebody whose mother cleared off
a mantel in the living room,

08:47.634 --> 08:50.928
just waiting for one of these.

08:50.928 --> 08:55.712
Whose mother came to every track
meet, even when she was sick.

08:55.712 --> 08:58.412
Even when she was dying.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.908
Maybe somebody likes that.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.131
Natalie, I'm talking about me.

09:05.131 --> 09:07.805
I know, Mr. Monk.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.860
Let's go.

09:13.243 --> 09:14.792
Julie showed me what happened.

09:14.792 --> 09:19.625
They found Coach Hayden's body
in here, next to the showers.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.249
Oh.

09:21.249 --> 09:24.397
- You okay?
- Girls' bathroom.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.276
What are you afraid of?
Cooties?

09:26.276 --> 09:30.177
Don't laugh.
Julie is still out on cooties.

09:30.177 --> 09:32.448
If we could only get
more federal funding.

09:32.448 --> 09:36.419
The valve under this sink was loose.
And the water was leaking.

09:36.419 --> 09:39.862
And then the hairdryer was
plugged into here.

09:41.019 --> 09:44.889
I thought these outlets had
built-in circuit breakers.

09:44.889 --> 09:46.924
Yeah, I thought so too.

09:47.548 --> 09:49.911
That's funny.
Look at that paint job.

09:49.911 --> 09:51.592
You can see the brush marks.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.292
Yeah, they don't line up.

09:53.292 --> 09:58.279
There's no dust on the top of that.
Natalie.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.454
Dust on the bottom?

10:06.454 --> 10:09.508
You're gonna need a wipe
for that.

10:09.508 --> 10:14.325
Yeah, I think somebody took
off this plate.

10:14.325 --> 10:18.871
And put it back on upside down.
Get ready.

10:25.298 --> 10:29.236
- Yeah, that... that's a loose wire.
- Huh.

10:29.236 --> 10:32.641
Do you think somebody could've
unscrewed that on purpose?

10:32.641 --> 10:34.463
I don't know.

10:36.753 --> 10:38.515
So the towel fell here?

10:38.515 --> 10:41.589
- On top of this drain?
- Yeah, that's right.

10:42.443 --> 10:46.440
Seems like the coach ran into a lot of
bad luck in this room all at once.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.194
Well, I guess that's how it
happens sometimes.

10:48.194 --> 10:53.445
Yes, to me, but this happened
to somebody else.

11:01.874 --> 11:03.602
What?

11:04.003 --> 11:05.636
That window's been opened.

11:05.636 --> 11:08.481
Which one? / The second one,
there's no cobwebs on it.

11:08.481 --> 11:12.355
All the other windows are
covered with them.

11:13.769 --> 11:15.530
Up you go.

11:15.807 --> 11:19.106
- What?
- Take a look. Check it out.

11:19.106 --> 11:21.573
- Up you go.
- Up you go.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.156
- Up you go.
- Up you go.

11:23.156 --> 11:25.778
Up you go. / I'm just
the assistant, remember?

11:25.778 --> 11:29.896
I believe the word "assist" is a
very large part of the word "assistant."

11:29.896 --> 11:34.947
Right? Assist.
From the Latin meaning "Up you go"!

11:36.099 --> 11:38.015
Come on over!

11:40.411 --> 11:42.182
Higher.

11:42.182 --> 11:43.255
Up.

11:44.452 --> 11:45.881
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

11:45.881 --> 11:47.182
Oh, my God.

11:47.182 --> 11:49.768
- God, Natalie, what is it?
- They're footprints!

11:49.768 --> 11:52.005
Footprints.
Down you go.

11:52.005 --> 11:54.222
- Okay, down I go.
- Down you go. / Down we go.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.669
Okay, this is everything.

12:00.669 --> 12:03.194
The famous killer hairdryer,

12:03.194 --> 12:05.240
the towel, and the rest of
the stuff from her locker.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.420
What about the footprints?

12:06.420 --> 12:08.747
There was a crew in there
working six weeks ago on the lights.

12:08.747 --> 12:10.663
- It could have been one of them.
- What about the outlet?

12:10.663 --> 12:12.369
We checked that too.
It was defective.

12:12.369 --> 12:15.043
There's no dust in the intake.

12:15.043 --> 12:17.888
This is practically brand-new.
But look.

12:17.888 --> 12:21.174
Look at the cord.
It's all taped up.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.889
Okay, Randy, I really don't think
the girls are lying.

12:22.889 --> 12:25.974
They hired Mr. Monk. They're
giving him all the money they have.

12:25.974 --> 12:28.696
- $57.
- You're not taking the money.

12:28.696 --> 12:31.065
Natalie, they're kids.
They're teenagers.

12:31.065 --> 12:32.543
They're probably lying to
protect themselves.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.749
You see how this tape's been cut?

12:34.749 --> 12:36.204
It's all jagged.

12:36.204 --> 12:39.983
Guys, look.
There is zero motive here.

12:39.983 --> 12:42.213
Lynn Hayden didn't have an
enemy in the world.

12:42.213 --> 12:44.168
She lived with her brother.
And the kids loved her.

12:44.168 --> 12:45.717
Even the other coaches liked her.

12:45.717 --> 12:48.372
She's boring.
It's like reading about Mother Teresa.

12:48.372 --> 12:50.395
- Natalie, here's your chance.
- Oh.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.002
Captain, um, are you busy?

12:52.002 --> 12:53.298
Uh, yes, I am

12:53.298 --> 12:56.716
Ronstadt, where is that lab report
on the Russian Hill carjacking?

12:56.716 --> 12:58.262
I need that yesterday.

12:58.262 --> 13:01.642
Um, Julie's doing
a science report on DNA.

13:01.901 --> 13:03.219
Oh, no, Natalie. I can't.

13:03.219 --> 13:05.841
She's supposed to interview
somebody, an expert.

13:05.841 --> 13:07.117
Can you just talk to her for ten minutes?

13:07.117 --> 13:09.689
She's having a terrible week,
and the report's due on Tuesday.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.697
Natalie, I wish I could,
but I can't.

13:11.697 --> 13:13.590
We've got three detectives
out sick today.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.231
Okay, it's just gonna take ten minutes.

13:15.231 --> 13:17.553
Look, what I'm juggling here, all right?

13:17.553 --> 13:20.983
I got two drive-by shootings,
one attempted murder...

13:20.983 --> 13:23.297
Oh, and that fire two weeks ago
in Dratch Valley.

13:23.297 --> 13:26.111
They're now saying that might be arson.
Now I'm working arson.

13:26.111 --> 13:29.958
Plus I just got another load of
hooey from my wife's lawyer.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.535
This her jacket?

13:33.227 --> 13:36.707
See that? It's missing a button.

13:38.794 --> 13:42.043
- What's that?
- It's a burr from a bush.

13:42.043 --> 13:44.362
She must have been outside.

13:44.362 --> 13:46.132
Doesn't help much, does it?

13:46.132 --> 13:48.281
Even you go outside.

13:48.281 --> 13:50.304
I can talk to her next week.

13:50.304 --> 13:52.873
How about Saturday?
I'll take you guys out for pancakes.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.893
Yeah, it's okay.
That's not gonna give her enough time.

13:54.893 --> 13:57.037
- It's all right.
- Okay.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.553
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to mention...

13:59.553 --> 14:03.368
My cousin works for a PR firm
for the 49ers.

14:03.368 --> 14:06.659
No kidding. / Yeah, Joe Montana's
gonna be in town on Thursday.

14:06.659 --> 14:09.495
He's shooting some commercial.
You wanna meet him?

14:09.495 --> 14:12.339
- Joe Montana, sure.
- Okay. You're not too busy?

14:12.339 --> 14:14.731
No, no, I'm sure
we could make that work.

14:14.731 --> 14:16.181
Oh, great. Because I lied.

14:16.181 --> 14:18.038
But it's nice to know you're
available on Thursday.

14:18.038 --> 14:21.582
Julie will be here after school.
Thanks.

14:29.075 --> 14:33.457
Ah, this brings back memories.
Sitting in the principal's office.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.556
You?

14:34.556 --> 14:36.942
I can't picture you being sent
to the principal's office.

14:36.942 --> 14:41.311
I wasn't sent.
I used to go there on my own.

14:41.311 --> 14:42.790
To report on the troublemakers.

14:42.790 --> 14:46.863
I was Mr. Kantman's eyes and ears.
That's what he called me.

14:46.863 --> 14:50.996
So you spied on other kids?

14:50.996 --> 14:55.287
I was keeping the study hall safe
for people like you.

14:56.826 --> 14:59.188
You're welcome.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.886
Oh, Natalie, hi.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

15:02.886 --> 15:04.685
That's okay.

15:05.012 --> 15:08.112
We're, um...
We're organizing a memorial service.

15:08.112 --> 15:10.136
Oh, of course.
Is there anything I can do?

15:10.136 --> 15:12.555
No, but, uh... I'll let you know.
Thanks.

15:12.555 --> 15:15.266
Um, this is my boss.
This is Adrian Monk. Principal Franklin.

15:15.266 --> 15:18.433
Oh, yes. We met last year
at the career day.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.527
- How've you been?
- The same.

15:20.527 --> 15:22.797
Oh, I'm sorry to here that.

15:26.678 --> 15:28.307
How's Julie been doing?

15:28.307 --> 15:32.012
Um... she's a having a hard time.
I think everybody is.

15:32.012 --> 15:33.797
Um, yeah.

15:33.797 --> 15:35.617
Here's that list you asked for.

15:35.617 --> 15:37.718
Everyone who had access
to the girls' locker room,

15:37.718 --> 15:41.586
including outside contractors. / Okay.

15:41.586 --> 15:44.228
Mr. Monk, you don't have to
raise your hand.

15:44.228 --> 15:48.514
Did Coach Hayden seem worried
or depressed about anything?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.845
Well, now that you mention it,

15:50.845 --> 15:53.060
the day before the incident,

15:53.060 --> 15:54.973
she was crying
in the teacher's lounge.

15:54.973 --> 15:57.770
She didn't say why.
I didn't think anything about it.

15:57.770 --> 16:00.892
Lot of our teachers cry quite a bit.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.754
Do you really think somebody
did do this deliberately.

16:05.754 --> 16:08.113
We don't know.

16:08.113 --> 16:11.008
Well, I hope to God not.
This has been very hard on the kids.

16:11.008 --> 16:12.868
Especially the team.

16:12.868 --> 16:15.052
Without a coach, we're gonna
have to forfeit the last game.

16:15.052 --> 16:18.814
The championship game?
No... I...

16:18.814 --> 16:20.563
I... I'll coach them. I'll do it.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.877
Oh, no, Natalie.
I... I wasn't trying...

16:21.877 --> 16:24.352
No, no, no.
I played basketball in high school.

16:24.352 --> 16:27.448
Varsity. All four years.
Plus I know all the girls.

16:27.448 --> 16:29.236
Well, it is only one game.

16:29.236 --> 16:32.296
Oh, I think the girls really need this.

16:32.296 --> 16:34.511
- Okay, we'll try it.
- Okay.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.802
You're gonna need an assistant.

16:40.686 --> 16:42.752
What?

16:42.752 --> 16:45.465
What are you looking at?

16:47.900 --> 16:51.708
Principal Franklin,
Natalie's staring at me.

16:57.491 --> 16:59.681
I don't know about this.

16:59.681 --> 17:01.775
I don't know much about basketball.

17:01.775 --> 17:05.457
Mr. Monk, you don't have to
know anything. You're my assistant.

17:05.761 --> 17:07.759
My assistant. I like that.

17:07.759 --> 17:10.667
- The worm has turned.
- Yeah, it certainly has.

17:10.667 --> 17:14.732
Plus it'll give you a chance to poke around
the school and ask some questions. / Okay.

17:14.732 --> 17:18.077
Oh, God, look at them.
Poor things.

17:18.077 --> 17:21.608
Hey, guys. Will you come over here?
Team meeting.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.820
Uh, how you guys doing?

17:28.645 --> 17:30.533
Yeah, I know.
I feel the same way.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.052
Uh, I'm Ms. Teeger.

17:32.052 --> 17:35.223
I'm sure you already know that
I'll be filling in for Coach Hayden.

17:35.223 --> 17:38.799
And this is Mr. Monk.
He'll be in charge of...

17:39.919 --> 17:43.039
Excuse me, can I just grab this
for a second?

17:45.672 --> 17:49.444
Thank you. / I know that this is
really hard for you guys.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.659
But Coach Hayden
never gave up, did she?

17:51.659 --> 17:55.163
If she were here, I know she would want
you guys to finish what you started.

17:55.163 --> 17:56.275
I think she's right.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.192
Yeah, you know, I've been
watching you guys all year.

17:58.192 --> 17:59.552
You guys are great.

17:59.552 --> 18:01.804
And if we practice
and focus really hard,

18:01.804 --> 18:04.268
I think we have a shot
at bringing home that trophy.

18:04.268 --> 18:06.057
There's... there's a trophy?

18:06.057 --> 18:07.546
If we win.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.330
Does everyone get one?

18:10.330 --> 18:11.939
Well, the whole team gets a big trophy.

18:11.939 --> 18:13.940
And then everyone gets little statues.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.933
Even the, uh...
Even the...

18:15.933 --> 18:17.961
Yes, Mr. Monk.
Even you would get a little trophy.

18:17.961 --> 18:19.632
Would it have my... my, um..

18:19.632 --> 18:23.498
Yes, Mr. Monk.
It'll have your name on it.

18:25.642 --> 18:27.805
All right, great shot.
Great shot.

18:27.805 --> 18:29.915
Emily J., let the ball roll off your fingers.

18:29.915 --> 18:31.343
Yeah, Emily, off the fingers.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.197
Okay, girls, keep it moving.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.521
Kimberly.
Try jumping off the other foot.

18:35.521 --> 18:37.631
Kimberly, come on.
The other foot.

18:37.631 --> 18:39.218
All right, have fun, girls.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.179
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, have fun.

18:41.179 --> 18:43.651
But don't forget to win.
Everybody loves a winner.

18:43.651 --> 18:48.350
- Mr. Monk.
- But have fun. But win.

18:48.350 --> 18:51.884
All right, girls. Let's do some
ball handling. So circle up.

18:51.884 --> 18:54.209
- Where's my whistle?
- Mr. Monk, you don't need a whistle.

18:54.209 --> 18:58.652
Yeah, I... I I I'm gonna have to buy a whistle
and one of those clipboards, I guess.

18:58.652 --> 19:00.717
So you've never won anything in
your whole life?

19:00.717 --> 19:04.340
Once, at a birthday party, I won
a game of musical chairs.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.392
- Well, that's something.
- Yeah, then I was disqualified.

19:07.392 --> 19:11.438
The mother said I went
counterclockwise or something.

19:11.438 --> 19:13.006
Well, at least you got invited to the party.

19:13.006 --> 19:16.849
It was my party, okay?
It was my mother.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.852
Kimberly, what did I tell you
about that foot?

19:22.116 --> 19:24.872
Hey, guys.
That was a great rehearsal.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.932
Practice.
Great practice.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.366
- Do you feel better?
- Yeah.

19:28.366 --> 19:30.296
Mr. Monk, we were wondering
how the case is going.

19:30.296 --> 19:32.736
Oh, well.
We're still working on it.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.988
But you were right.
It wasn't an accident.

19:34.988 --> 19:36.483
- So you mean it wasn't our fault?
- No.

19:36.483 --> 19:38.711
Oh, I knew it!
Told you!

19:38.711 --> 19:40.527
Mr. Monk.
Thank you for believing us.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.070
And...

19:42.570 --> 19:46.125
And you don't have to pay me.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.305
So, Mr. Monk, who did this?

19:48.305 --> 19:50.341
- Well, we don't know that yet.
- Yeah.

19:50.341 --> 19:53.068
Oh, Em. Here is your necklace.
Sorry. / Thank you.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.041
Well, that's very beautiful.
What is it?

19:55.041 --> 19:56.722
Oh, it's an arrowhead.

19:56.722 --> 19:59.298
- Coach Hayden gave it to me.
- Very beautiful.

19:59.298 --> 20:02.276
She brought about 15 back
from Dratch Valley.

20:02.276 --> 20:03.840
Dratch Valley?

20:03.840 --> 20:06.291
She went hiking up there.

20:06.291 --> 20:10.456
Was she up there maybe
two weeks ago?

20:10.456 --> 20:13.033
Uh, I think so.

20:14.075 --> 20:17.268
Didn't the captain say something
about a fire?

20:17.580 --> 20:19.903
Well, it's pretty obvious what happened.

20:19.903 --> 20:23.042
Um... this is the point of origin.

20:23.042 --> 20:26.408
Natalie, right here.
Point of origin.

20:26.408 --> 20:28.200
Please go on.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.965
Well, somebody was here camping out
unauthorized. Without a permit.

20:31.965 --> 20:37.552
And apparently the wind shifted
from east to north.

20:37.552 --> 20:41.138
East to north.
Got it.

20:41.851 --> 20:43.183
Continue please.

20:43.183 --> 20:45.846
It's his first whistle.

20:45.846 --> 20:47.847
Well, the brush around here
was bone dry.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.867
So those branches probably caught first.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.958
And then they spread downwind.

20:51.958 --> 20:55.246
And then once it hits the valley,
well, there's no stopping it.

20:55.246 --> 20:58.452
So the fire was moving...

20:58.452 --> 21:01.623
Up the hill, that way. Right?

21:01.623 --> 21:03.234
Yeah, are you with the arson squad,
Mr. Monk?

21:03.234 --> 21:05.916
No, no.
This is a private investigation.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.450
And call me Coach.
Coach Monk.

21:08.450 --> 21:09.930
I thought you were a detective.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.059
I am a detective.

21:12.059 --> 21:15.500
I also coach high school basketball.
The Ashton Cougars.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.615
Are you into b-ball?
"B" stands for basketball.

21:18.615 --> 21:22.029
- Not really.
- What are you doing Saturday?

21:22.029 --> 21:24.519
- My parents' anniversary. 50 years.
- Perfect.

21:24.519 --> 21:26.979
Bring them to the game.
It's the league championship.

21:26.979 --> 21:28.845
- I don't think so.
- It'll be great.

21:28.845 --> 21:35.121
We're using a zone defense, which is
the best kind of defense you can have.

21:35.121 --> 21:38.540
We're gonna kick their rumps all
over the field.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.660
- You mean court.
- Natalie. He might come to the game.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.999
I didn't say that.

21:42.999 --> 21:46.573
Mr. Monk, can you just focus on
other questions about the fire?

21:46.573 --> 21:49.596
You know, the reason why we came here,
why we drove for two and a half-hours.

21:49.596 --> 21:53.337
Yeah, yeah.
The fire. Let me think.

22:44.866 --> 22:46.301
Anybody hurt?

22:46.301 --> 22:48.632
No, sir.
Just some property damage.

22:48.632 --> 22:54.852
- Five or six summer homes.
- So the fire spread up that way.

22:54.852 --> 22:58.308
They probably ran down there.

22:58.308 --> 23:00.232
Let's have a look.

23:00.232 --> 23:01.286
I'll wait by the jeep.

23:01.286 --> 23:04.025
Okay, if we get lost, I'll blow the whistle.

23:04.025 --> 23:06.407
- I'm sure you will.
- See you Saturday.

23:06.407 --> 23:08.571
Go Cougars.

23:16.981 --> 23:18.498
Oh.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.996
- Oh!.
- What?

23:22.649 --> 23:24.948
Oh, burr.

23:29.346 --> 23:31.423
Natalie.

23:32.868 --> 23:34.265
Oh.

23:39.152 --> 23:42.729
That's from Linda Hayden's coat.

23:49.994 --> 23:50.947
Oh, my God.

23:50.947 --> 23:53.863
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you think
she could have been involved with the fire?

23:53.863 --> 23:55.603
Maybe that's why she was killed.

23:55.603 --> 23:58.218
There's gotta be a connection.

23:58.502 --> 24:01.506
But I don't see it.
What happened here was an accident.

24:01.506 --> 24:06.523
Nobody was hurt.
Nobody even knew she caused it.

24:07.546 --> 24:09.713
- Please don't.
- It helps me think.

24:09.713 --> 24:11.323
No, no, no, no.

24:24.162 --> 24:26.355
Backup.

24:30.003 --> 24:32.875
Gotta be a connection.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.864
Just gotta be a connection.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.496
Aaron, I know this is a terrible time.

24:41.496 --> 24:43.243
So you lived here with your sister?

24:43.243 --> 24:46.210
Uh, she took me in after my divorce.

24:46.210 --> 24:49.431
After both of my divorces, actually.

24:49.431 --> 24:51.919
I mean, she could never say no
to anybody.

24:51.919 --> 24:54.037
This is a nice trophy.

24:54.037 --> 24:56.009
Was your sister a golfer?

24:56.009 --> 24:58.859
- Actually, that one's mine.
- Ah.

24:59.134 --> 25:03.950
Looks nice up here on the mantel.
My mother had a mantel just like this.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.603
Except it was wood.

25:05.603 --> 25:11.526
And empty.
Just this big, empty mantel.

25:11.526 --> 25:16.736
Um, Aaron, we know that your
sister set that fire in Dratch Valley.

25:16.736 --> 25:18.808
That was an accident.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.992
She was camping, and... and
the wind shifted.

25:21.992 --> 25:24.809
We know, we talked to her best
friend Christa Barnardin.

25:24.809 --> 25:25.832
I know Christa.

25:25.832 --> 25:28.712
Christa said that Lynn was going
to turn herself in next week.

25:28.712 --> 25:32.256
She also said that you tried
to talk her out of it.

25:32.795 --> 25:34.754
That's true.

25:34.754 --> 25:38.831
The fire destroyed six homes.
They would've charged her with a felony.

25:39.147 --> 25:41.718
They would've taken away her
teaching license.

25:41.718 --> 25:43.368
I tried to tell her that it wasn't worth it.

25:43.368 --> 25:44.836
I mean, nobody got hurt.

25:44.836 --> 25:48.453
- But she didn't see it that way?
- No.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.577
No, not my sister.

25:50.577 --> 25:53.157
She always had to do the right thing.

25:53.157 --> 25:56.991
She said that's what she taught her kids.
And she didn't want to be a hypocrite.

25:56.991 --> 25:59.277
- That's a nice photo.
- Thanks.

25:59.277 --> 26:02.251
The school asked for a picture so they
could hang it up in the girls' locker room.

26:02.251 --> 26:04.270
It's beautiful.
It'll mean a lot to the girls.

26:04.270 --> 26:07.243
Except the frame is broken.
It's got a crack there.

26:07.243 --> 26:08.924
I know.
I was gonna fix that.

26:08.924 --> 26:11.107
Well, you could buy a new one.

26:11.107 --> 26:13.476
Oh, that's okay.
I'll just fix it. It's no big deal.

26:13.476 --> 26:16.169
But you could just buy a new
one, a nice, new frame.

26:16.169 --> 26:17.562
Yeah, let's do that.

26:17.562 --> 26:19.303
No, no, he said he was gonna fix it.

26:19.303 --> 26:21.054
Yeah, well, it's up to you.

26:21.054 --> 26:24.664
But you could just buy a new one.
A nice, new frame, crack free.

26:24.664 --> 26:27.014
In honor of your sister.

26:27.014 --> 26:28.664
Your dead, beloved sister.

26:28.664 --> 26:30.940
Okay, we're done here.
Thank you, Aaron.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.687
- Let's go.
- Let's go. We're going.

26:32.687 --> 26:34.276
Thank you.

26:36.526 --> 26:39.820
We're passing a frame shop.
I could just pop in. Be my treat.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.723
Now.

26:47.721 --> 26:49.846
Um, okay, I wrote down a few questions.

26:49.846 --> 26:51.287
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

26:51.287 --> 26:54.417
All right. Bring it on.
Question... number one.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.348
Okay... what does DNA stand for?

26:56.348 --> 27:03.107
DNA... dex...
Dexocho... Das... DNA.

27:03.107 --> 27:05.791
- You don't know.
- It's a chemical. DNA.

27:05.791 --> 27:12.100
- Dennis... acid.
- Deoxyribonucleic acid. / Okay.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.086
- Who discovered DNA?
- Oh, I got it. I know this one. Um...

27:15.086 --> 27:21.182
Good. / Whish... ah.
Wall... Will... Will...

27:22.249 --> 27:25.156
Actually, nobody really knows.

27:25.156 --> 27:27.759
- Watson and Crick.
- Watson and Crick.

27:27.759 --> 27:31.130
- Two British scientists.
- From England.

27:31.130 --> 27:35.498
Well...
I brought this diagram.

27:35.498 --> 27:38.173
Oh, excellent.
Actually, this is called a map.

27:38.173 --> 27:40.737
- Map, map!
- Oh, okay, okay. / Had that one.

27:40.737 --> 27:42.672
- Is everyone's DNA different?
- Yes.

27:42.672 --> 27:46.990
Everyone's DNA is different.
It's like a billion little codes.

27:46.990 --> 27:49.932
All different.
Except for identical twins. / Okay.

27:49.932 --> 27:52.578
Well, what about just regular
family members?

27:52.578 --> 27:54.941
Just a little bit different.
But very close. / It...

27:54.941 --> 27:59.023
- But not identical.
- Like, this close.

27:59.023 --> 28:01.220
Well, uh... like that.

28:01.220 --> 28:05.122
If DNA is like a fingerprint, then
why can't you solve every single case?

28:05.122 --> 28:08.535
First of all, we do not find DNA
at every crime scene.

28:08.535 --> 28:11.909
And even if we did, you have
something to match it against.

28:11.909 --> 28:14.914
There was a young woman.

28:14.914 --> 28:17.861
She wasn't much older than you.
What was her name?
Remember, a couple years ago.

28:17.861 --> 28:19.761
- Oh, uh, tach...
- The Irish girl.

28:19.761 --> 28:22.382
- McGoohan. / McGoohan.
- Paula McGoohan / Paula McGoohan.

28:22.382 --> 28:25.285
We found her body in the middle
of a golf course.

28:25.285 --> 28:27.718
There was a ton of DNA at the scene.
And, uh...

28:27.718 --> 28:29.044
We ran it through the system,

28:29.044 --> 28:32.748
but we couldn't get a hit because
there wasn't anything to match it against.

28:32.748 --> 28:34.788
Do you have any multiple choice, Julie?

28:34.788 --> 28:37.584
Actually, I'm all done.

28:37.584 --> 28:39.886
My mom's picking me up.
I have basketball practice.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.047
Oh, excellent.

28:42.047 --> 28:44.425
You know, I think it's great that
you kids are finishing the season.

28:44.425 --> 28:46.119
Your coach would be very proud.

28:46.119 --> 28:48.372
You sound like Coach Monk.

28:48.372 --> 28:49.455
Coach Monk?

28:49.455 --> 28:52.720
Yeah, he's helping my mom out.
He's the assistant coach.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.422
Thank you.

28:55.181 --> 28:56.388
You're welcome.

28:56.388 --> 28:58.501
- See ya.
- Bye bye. / Bye.

29:00.425 --> 29:03.086
Monk is coaching basketball?

29:03.086 --> 29:05.052
Matthew, what's happening out in
Dratch Valley?

29:05.052 --> 29:08.651
Beth, according to my sources, the police
are investigating a possible connection

29:08.651 --> 29:11.396
between last month's brush fire
in Dratch Valley

29:11.396 --> 29:14.138
and the death last week
of a popular local gym teacher.

29:14.138 --> 29:16.892
You may remember that
that was originally ruled an accident.

29:16.892 --> 29:20.275
However, new evidence is
indicating foul play.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.677
As many of you know,

30:26.677 --> 30:29.716
Ashton High School lost
a very dear friend last week.

30:29.716 --> 30:35.758
Lynn Hayden was more than a coach.
She was a member of our family.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.361
Her brother Aaron is sitting in
the stands with us tonight.

30:38.361 --> 30:40.420
Thank you for coming, Aaron.

30:40.420 --> 30:44.111
The Cougars want to let you know
that they're dedicating tonight's game

30:44.111 --> 30:45.853
in Lynn's memory.

30:45.853 --> 30:50.012
Let's all rise, please, and give
her a moment of silence.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.917
Cougars!

31:44.917 --> 31:46.923
Put it up! Put it up!

31:51.808 --> 31:53.751
That's all right.
It's all right.

31:54.096 --> 31:56.491
All right, Cougars.
Defense.

31:56.491 --> 31:58.787
Defense! Defense!

31:58.787 --> 32:01.568
- Defense!
- Defense! Defense!

32:06.110 --> 32:08.232
So which one's yours?

32:09.421 --> 32:12.466
The big one with the whistle.

32:13.621 --> 32:17.596
Emily's open!
No the other Emily!

32:18.515 --> 32:21.189
Hey, cut that out!

32:40.019 --> 32:42.260
Continue play.

32:51.214 --> 32:54.119
Come on, Julie!
Get up, get up, get up!

32:54.119 --> 32:56.143
Take that shot now!

33:06.669 --> 33:09.152
- Okay!.
- Come on, girls!

33:09.152 --> 33:11.832
Let's go.
Bid D. Big D! Bid D!

33:11.832 --> 33:16.670
- Mr. Monk, we're on offense.
- No, forget what I said. Big O, Big O!

33:16.670 --> 33:18.825
All right, set the screen.

33:18.825 --> 33:22.731
Go, go, go, go, go.
Time-out, time-out.

33:22.763 --> 33:25.352
- 30-second time-out purple.
- Okay, come on girls.

33:25.352 --> 33:27.303
Bring it in, bring it in.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

33:27.303 --> 33:28.589
You're doing great.
We're still in there.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.364
But you're giving them too many
open looks at the basket.

33:30.364 --> 33:33.903
- Don't let them look at the basket.
- Right. / It's like this.

33:33.903 --> 33:37.133
- Okay. This is the basket.
- Right.

33:37.133 --> 33:41.557
Actually, the rim is...
It's really orange.

33:41.557 --> 33:44.284
- Mr. Monk, we only have 30 seconds.
- Yeah, plenty of time.

33:44.284 --> 33:47.310
All right, now, you see
that circle in the middle there?

33:47.310 --> 33:51.969
You know that circle?
This some lines missing.

33:51.969 --> 33:53.402
Keep your hands up.
Keep on in there.

33:53.402 --> 33:54.589
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Let's go!

33:54.589 --> 33:57.619
One, two, three.
Cougars!

33:58.034 --> 33:59.610
All right!

34:03.997 --> 34:05.996
Let's see some hustle.

34:05.996 --> 34:09.527
Get inside.
Four points, girls.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.592
Offensive foul, number 11.

34:13.592 --> 34:15.011
What are you talking about?
You blind?

34:15.011 --> 34:16.719
She was moving her feet.
That was a block.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.888
- She had no position.
- Coach, get back on the bench.

34:18.888 --> 34:20.204
Oh, you're a joke.

34:20.204 --> 34:22.078
Technical foul, Coach Teeger.

34:22.078 --> 34:24.114
- Now who's the joke?
- It's still you.

34:24.114 --> 34:27.268
That's it, Teeger.
You're gone. / Oh!

34:28.675 --> 34:30.918
Number 13, you're shooting.

34:30.918 --> 34:32.635
Mr. Monk. / All right,
I think I've figured this out.

34:32.635 --> 34:33.862
I decided to go with black for the net.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.118
- I'm out of the game.
- What?

34:35.118 --> 34:36.873
It's all up to you.
I'm out of the game.

34:36.873 --> 34:39.217
- Wait, what...
- Okay, listen carefully.

34:39.217 --> 34:40.449
We're only down by four.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.925
If we tie it up, go man to man,
then at the two minute mark,

34:42.925 --> 34:44.726
switch over to a full court press...

34:44.726 --> 34:47.504
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Teeger.

34:47.504 --> 34:51.547
All right. I gotta go.
Good luck, Coach.

34:53.003 --> 34:56.277
Well, this just got very interesting.

35:02.646 --> 35:04.430
Don't give up, you guys.
We're still in this!

35:04.430 --> 35:07.858
- Mr. Monk, we're winning.
- That's the spirit!

35:08.216 --> 35:09.704
Time out!

35:10.392 --> 35:13.068
30 second time out, yellow.

35:16.738 --> 35:18.098
Mr. Monk, stop.
What is the plan?

35:18.098 --> 35:19.790
Yeah, all right.
Let's just keep it simple.

35:19.790 --> 35:22.980
See, each basket we sink
counts as two points.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.267
Except if you're behind the line.

35:24.267 --> 35:26.365
Emily, you're just confusing everyone.

35:26.365 --> 35:27.955
- She's not Emily.
- She's Emily now.

35:27.955 --> 35:30.586
You're all Emily, understand?
We're gonna be fine.

35:30.586 --> 35:33.233
Everybody just go out there
and give 100%.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.141
But Coach Hayden said we
should give 110%.

35:35.141 --> 35:37.058
No, no, no.
That's a bad idea.

35:37.058 --> 35:38.522
Anyway, it's mathematically impossible.

35:38.522 --> 35:40.570
Just give 100 percent.
It's a nice, round number.

35:40.570 --> 35:41.789
Well, I'm gonna give 110 percent.

35:41.789 --> 35:44.433
Fine.
Okay, Julie, you give 90 percent.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.990
Well, I'm gonna give 115 percent.

35:45.990 --> 35:48.522
Oh, for God's sake. Okay, fine.
Then, Julie, you're down to 75%.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.659
- Mr. Monk, how am I supposed...
- Just do it!

35:50.659 --> 35:57.339
Okay, all right. So that's 110 percent,
100 percent, 100... 115, 75.

35:57.862 --> 35:59.816
Okay, guys, come on.
Before we go, hands in.

35:59.816 --> 36:02.506
One, two, three.
Cougars!

36:03.133 --> 36:04.918
Go Cougars.

36:08.244 --> 36:10.189
- I need a break.
- Jen, what's the score?

36:10.189 --> 36:12.774
- It's all tied up.
- Oh, God!

36:12.774 --> 36:14.519
Oh!

36:30.768 --> 36:34.869
Julie.
Julie, what are you doing?

36:35.085 --> 36:39.692
Am I crazy,
or is she giving 100 percent?

36:40.501 --> 36:43.829
- Not again!
- Mr. Monk, it's me!

36:43.829 --> 36:45.796
- Natalie?
- Look, I found this.

36:45.796 --> 36:47.215
Look at the frame.

36:47.215 --> 36:50.377
Look at the tape.
It's uneven, just like the hairdryer.

36:50.377 --> 36:53.309
So it's the brother, right?

37:13.368 --> 37:15.144
Captain Stottlemeyer?

37:15.627 --> 37:17.565
Hey, he knows your name.

37:17.565 --> 37:19.947
Captain... / Don't touch me.
I've got a gun.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.195
It's me, Natalie.

37:22.649 --> 37:24.457
- Natalie?
- Natalie?

37:30.222 --> 37:32.833
What's going on? / Remember that
cold case from two years ago?

37:32.833 --> 37:35.708
The girl on the golf course.
What was the name of that country club?

37:35.708 --> 37:38.478
Conrad. Conrad Country Club.
I got it. / That's it.

37:38.478 --> 37:42.480
I know who killed Lynn Hayden.
He's here. Front row.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.190
To the right of the scoring table.
Blue shirt.

37:46.537 --> 37:49.594
- The brother?
- He's the guy.

37:51.368 --> 37:52.838
Mr. Monk, can't we do this later?

37:52.838 --> 37:54.792
It can't wait.
I think he knows we're on to him.

37:54.792 --> 37:56.841
- What about the girls?
- Okay.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.153
Ref. Time... time out!

37:59.153 --> 38:00.752
Time out, purple.

38:00.752 --> 38:03.629
Okay, hurry up. / Aaron Hayden
belongs to that country club.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.841
It was on the trophy on his mantel.
Conrad Country Club.

38:05.841 --> 38:08.128
Here's what happened.
Aaron Hayden killed Paula McGoohan.

38:08.128 --> 38:11.533
I remember the case.
There was DNA evidence all over the scene
but nothing to match it against.

38:11.533 --> 38:13.710
- 20 seconds.
- Lynn Hayden told her brother

38:13.710 --> 38:15.708
she started that brush fire
and planned to turn herself in.

38:15.708 --> 38:17.734
That's why she was so upset
last week. / 15 seconds.

38:17.734 --> 38:19.048
Aaron tried to talk her out of it.

38:19.048 --> 38:20.614
He knew she'd be arrested,
which meant...

38:20.614 --> 38:23.126
- We would take a DNA sample...
- Routine for a felony arrest.

38:23.126 --> 38:26.010
10 seconds. / He knew
if you ran her DNA through the system,

38:26.010 --> 38:28.093
it would lead you to the country club murder,
which would lead you to him.

38:28.093 --> 38:30.470
It happens with siblings.
A near hit.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.477
He was trapped.
He couldn't let her confess.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.949
If she was arrested,
he was a dead man.

38:37.854 --> 38:40.395
Oh, hell.
Hey, hey!

38:45.141 --> 38:46.505
Hey!

38:47.802 --> 38:50.373
Don't give me an excuse, pal.

38:50.373 --> 38:51.933
I've got a message from Adrian Monk.

38:51.933 --> 38:53.175
Yeah, what's that?

38:53.175 --> 38:55.952
He says you should've bought
a new frame.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.421
Get it in!
Shoot!

39:06.713 --> 39:08.982
Shoot it!

39:15.533 --> 39:19.285
We won!
We won!

39:26.235 --> 39:28.306
I won something.

39:28.306 --> 39:30.893
- How does it feel, Mr. Monk?
- It feels...

39:30.893 --> 39:33.243
It feels like something's wrong.

39:33.837 --> 39:36.370
Clear the court!
We still have two seconds on the clock.

39:36.370 --> 39:38.267
Let's clear the court.

39:38.364 --> 39:40.439
- What's happening?
- Well, it's not over yet.

39:40.439 --> 39:42.748
Put two seconds back on the clock.

39:42.748 --> 39:47.263
Of course. / Don't worry. They have
one shot. They'll never make it.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.142
Of course.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.597
Of course.

39:57.346 --> 39:59.597
Of course.

40:08.234 --> 40:09.781
Of course.

40:10.971 --> 40:13.209
Of course.

40:16.371 --> 40:19.223
I don't believe it!
Did you see that?

40:19.223 --> 40:21.461
Many times.

40:24.272 --> 40:27.200
Don't be sad, Mr. Monk.
There's always next year.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.893
No, it's never next year.

40:29.893 --> 40:32.090
I'm going home.

40:44.340 --> 40:46.386
- Keep your eyes closed?
- OK.

40:46.386 --> 40:50.189
Alright, Mr. Monk,
the girls and I got you a gift.

40:50.189 --> 40:52.436
- Is it $57?
- No.

40:52.436 --> 40:54.526
You can open them now.

40:55.187 --> 40:58.976
What?
Whoa.

40:58.976 --> 41:03.539
Trophies.
Boxes of little trophies.

41:03.539 --> 41:05.442
The Captain let me go through your files.

41:05.442 --> 41:10.362
There's a trophy for every murder you've
solve since the beginning of your career.

41:10.362 --> 41:12.082
"World's Greatest Detective."

41:12.082 --> 41:16.197
Actually, you solved 104 cases.
But we rounded it down.

41:16.197 --> 41:19.307
To make it an even 100.

41:19.307 --> 41:20.847
I don't know what to say.

41:20.847 --> 41:22.613
Well, you don't have to say anything.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.877
You wanna put them on your mantel?

41:24.877 --> 41:27.602
On my mantel.

41:32.694 --> 41:34.314
Oh, Mr. Monk?

41:34.314 --> 41:38.263
This one's for solving our case.
It's from the whole team.

41:41.144 --> 41:44.034
I'm not gonna have enough room.

41:44.034 --> 41:46.408
I need a bigger mantel.

41:46.408 --> 41:48.885
Natalie, I need a bigger mantel.

41:48.885 --> 41:51.026
Oh, Mr. Monk, your mother
would be so proud.

41:51.026 --> 41:55.337
Oh, no, she wouldn't.
But it was nice of you to say.
