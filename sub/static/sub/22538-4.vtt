how are you?

he killed those twirls.

pounding the beat
as a 1 9-year-old flatfoot.

37:02.253 --> 37:06.587
Me and Edwin Brooks teamed up
with this guy Harry O'Bryan.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.316
Harry'd been on the beaches
at Normandy,

37:09.360 --> 37:12.386
won a medal. Never talked about it.

37:13.497 --> 37:15.397
Harry was a legend.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.535
But in them days, there were
some bad apples in our house,

37:20.571 --> 37:23.563
and we found out
that Harry was one of them.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.640
What did you do?

37:27.678 --> 37:30.841
Edwin did what most shiny, moral,

37:31.616 --> 37:33.641
just-shaving new kid
on the block would do.

37:33.684 --> 37:36.585
He ratted Harry out
for being on the take.

37:37.321 --> 37:42.384
Me, I kept my mouth shut
and my head down.

37:43.694 --> 37:46.822
Everyone hated Eddie for squealing.
They turned their backs on him.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.492
People he admired,
people he wanted to be,

37:49.533 --> 37:52.127
they didn't want him in their club.

37:53.070 --> 37:56.233
-He did the right thing.
-He couldn't handle it.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.272
Ate his gun for Sunday brunch.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.143
-How did that make you feel?
-Like crap.

38:05.283 --> 38:09.185
-How does it make you feel now?
-I try not to think about it.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.885
I do my job as best I can.

38:12.923 --> 38:16.518
I try and take care of my men
and the people in my city.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.089
When you do think about it,

38:21.032 --> 38:23.159
how do you feel?

38:25.536 --> 38:28.903
Like there's an animal
eating away at my insides.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.864
(GENE SNlFFS)

38:31.542 --> 38:35.239
-Want to do something about it?
-Thought you'd never ask.

38:41.285 --> 38:44.220
(LONG COOL WOMAN
IN A BLACK DRESS PLAYlNG)

38:46.023 --> 38:48.287
-GENE: Police! Hey, hey!
-What do you think you're doing, Hunt?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.988
Sweet Adrienne asked me
to pay you boys a visit

38:51.028 --> 38:53.189
after we pulled her out
of the East River.

38:53.230 --> 38:55.357
Boss, we got them.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.095
You think there aren't gonna be
consequences for this, Hunt?

38:58.135 --> 38:59.534
-Hold it.
-Not to mention allowing

38:59.570 --> 39:02.266
the Pignato Brothers, Morgan,
all the rest of them to run amok?

39:02.306 --> 39:04.706
I'm shaking in my snappy white shoes.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.302
Speaking of consequences,
jail is a pretty dangerous place

39:07.345 --> 39:09.472
for a couple of rats, ain't it,
Detective Tyler?

39:09.513 --> 39:12.778
Oh, yeah. Rikers is gonna be crawling
with some very pissed-off meatballs

39:12.817 --> 39:16.150
these two snitched off
to you, Lieutenant Hunt.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.518
What are you doing here?

39:21.559 --> 39:25.222
What do you think, boy scout?
She was gonna settle a debt.

39:26.263 --> 39:29.096
I've never done anything
like this before.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.627
And nothing happened.
Okay? Nothing.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.934
I was scared for Sammy.

39:38.342 --> 39:39.832
Go home.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.506
Kiss your son good night.

39:46.250 --> 39:48.946
You are a good man, Detective.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.315
Your mother must be very proud.

40:05.469 --> 40:08.802
With just one look I was a bad mess

40:08.973 --> 40:12.136
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

40:14.145 --> 40:15.772
Had it all

40:17.581 --> 40:20.914
Had it all

40:21.018 --> 40:22.042
Had it all

40:22.553 --> 40:24.350
(ALL CHEERlNG)

40:26.991 --> 40:29.687
We're taking an hour of lost time,
I'm pouring.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.092
COP: All right!

40:32.029 --> 40:33.462
SAM: Annie.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.260
Listen, about yesterday morning.

40:35.299 --> 40:36.596
Yeah, about that.

40:36.634 --> 40:39.432
-I am...
-Sam, I heard what happened.

40:40.004 --> 40:41.028
(LAUGHS)

40:42.773 --> 40:44.536
I'm sorry, anyway.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.804
You did good tonight, Tyler.

40:47.845 --> 40:51.212
Every cop in this house is gonna
walk a little taller tomorrow.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.647
Thanks.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.210
(LONG PROMISED ROAD PLAYlNG)

40:54.251 --> 40:55.684
You know,

40:56.787 --> 40:58.550
I thought if I ever saw you naked,

40:58.589 --> 41:01.922
it would be under
very different circumstances.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.797
(SINGING) So hard to shed
the life of before

41:09.200 --> 41:12.829
To let my soul automatically soar

41:12.903 --> 41:17.397
But I hit hard at the battle
that's confronting me, yeah

41:17.641 --> 41:21.042
Knock down all the roadblocks
a-stumbling me

41:21.111 --> 41:26.310
Throw off all the shackles
that are binding me down

41:29.353 --> 41:32.618
Sew up the wounds of evolution

41:32.990 --> 41:35.686
And the now starts to get in my way

41:37.194 --> 41:38.559
SAM MY: Mom my.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.257
... if life 's a revelation

41:40.364 --> 41:43.356
If the mind speaks of only today

41:45.135 --> 41:48.764
No. No, sweetie. Here, lay down.

41:48.806 --> 41:52.105
Of climbing up to reality's goal

41:52.209 --> 41:56.703
But I hit hard at the battle
that's confronting me, yeah

41:56.847 --> 42:01.079
Throw off all the shackles
that are binding me down

Mommy loves you, Sammy?
