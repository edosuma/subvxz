00:21.543 --> 00:23.877
Just a year ago, one of the
vaccinators was assassinated

00:23.962 --> 00:27.013
in this neighborhood
for doing this work.

00:27.099 --> 00:30.517
And then, the lingering terror
of war in Southeast Asia.

00:32.521 --> 00:37.307
The Vietnam war left millions of
unexploded ordnance in the ground.

00:55.210 --> 00:58.328
Crowd: Hands up!
Don't shoot! Hands up!

01:06.004 --> 01:08.054
The development
of a polio vaccine was

01:08.140 --> 01:10.423
one of the greatest successes
of modern medicine.

01:10.559 --> 01:15.228
<i>New infections fell from hundreds of
thousands per year to almost zero.</i>

01:15.313 --> 01:17.313
But in Pakistan in recent years,

01:17.432 --> 01:19.399
the disease has actually spiked.

01:19.484 --> 01:21.818
So we went to Karachi
to find out why.

01:37.002 --> 01:40.086
Ben Anderson: <i>Vaccinating against
polio is incredibly simple.</i>

01:45.844 --> 01:47.377
Each kid is getting two drops.

01:47.462 --> 01:48.795
How many times
do they have to get that

01:48.880 --> 01:50.346
before they're vaccinated?

01:55.771 --> 01:58.805
Anderson: <i>And that's all
it takes, a few drops</i>

01:58.890 --> 02:01.391
<i>in a child's mouth several times.</i>

02:03.361 --> 02:05.228
<i>Polio is a highly contagious disease</i>

02:05.313 --> 02:08.481
<i>that spreads through contact
with infected human feces.</i>

02:09.901 --> 02:12.986
<i>In countries like Pakistan
where almost 70 million people</i>

02:13.121 --> 02:17.040
<i>don't have access to adequate
sanitation, it can run rampant.</i>

02:18.994 --> 02:21.911
<i>The virus affects thousands
of people here.</i>

02:21.997 --> 02:25.632
<i>In acute cases, it can
cause permanent paralysis,</i>

02:25.717 --> 02:28.384
<i>often affecting the legs and spine.</i>

02:30.889 --> 02:34.507
<i>Almost every other country on
Earth has eradicated the disease.</i>

02:34.593 --> 02:37.560
<i>Nigeria was declared
polio-free last year,</i>

02:37.679 --> 02:39.479
<i>and Afghanistan is very close.</i>

02:39.564 --> 02:44.651
<i>Pakistan had the most new
cases by far in 2015.</i>

02:44.736 --> 02:49.189
<i>The reason for this is that some
families refuse the vaccine...</i>

02:49.274 --> 02:51.324
<i>often believing
in conspiracy theories</i>

02:51.409 --> 02:54.360
<i>about it being a foreign
plot to harm Muslims.</i>

02:56.031 --> 02:58.865
<i>Throughout Pakistan, an army
of female health workers</i>

02:59.000 --> 03:03.036
<i>goes door to door, trying to
make sure every child is safe.</i>

03:08.960 --> 03:10.760
Anderson: <i>It's a job
that only women can do,</i>

03:10.879 --> 03:12.212
<i>because in the more
conservative areas</i>

03:12.347 --> 03:14.848
<i>only they are allowed
into families' homes.</i>

03:16.518 --> 03:18.434
The vaccinators have been here.

03:18.553 --> 03:20.353
You can see their chalk markings.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.360
Anderson: So the next house
we're going to is a house

03:37.405 --> 03:39.572
where apparently
the family have said no

03:39.658 --> 03:41.574
to taking the vaccine in the past.

03:55.924 --> 03:57.724
What do you think their plan is?

04:12.440 --> 04:14.680
But you've seen no evidence
that this is funded by Israel

04:14.776 --> 04:17.493
and no evidence that this is
going to make people impotent.

04:20.281 --> 04:21.531
Anderson: But you believe
that these women,

04:21.616 --> 04:24.033
who've dedicated their lives
to vaccinating children,

04:24.119 --> 04:25.835
are agents of Israel?

04:29.090 --> 04:30.590
What's your reaction to that?

04:39.384 --> 04:41.551
Anderson: <i>We spoke
to Haji Saddar Khan,</i>

04:41.636 --> 04:44.771
<i>who lives in an area where several
families have refused drops.</i>

04:54.316 --> 04:56.232
When did she first start getting ill?

05:04.826 --> 05:08.161
When the vaccination teams
came to this house,

05:08.296 --> 05:11.331
did your family allow her to
get the drops into her mouth?

05:20.141 --> 05:22.842
So her grandfather has somehow
been given the impression

05:22.978 --> 05:24.427
that she's going to make
a full recovery.

05:24.512 --> 05:27.931
I think what's going to happen
is her central nervous system

05:28.016 --> 05:31.267
is going to stop sending the
right messages to her muscles

05:31.353 --> 05:33.903
and her muscles are
going to start wasting away.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.189
The local vaccination teams have said

05:36.274 --> 05:40.026
that this house used
to be a refusal house...

05:40.161 --> 05:44.948
so maybe someone in this family
refused to let her get her drops.

05:48.036 --> 05:51.037
<i>We followed the family to Karachi's
biggest children's hospital</i>

05:51.122 --> 05:55.458
<i>to see a doctor who could confirm whether
or not the little girl had polio.</i>

07:12.787 --> 07:15.254
There are actually
a number of reasons

07:15.340 --> 07:17.874
why people refuse vaccination.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.093
The first reason is
that there is some myth

07:20.178 --> 07:24.347
of making people infertile by
giving these kinds of vaccinations.

07:24.466 --> 07:26.966
And then there was this issue

07:27.052 --> 07:28.968
about Osama Bin Laden getting caught

07:29.104 --> 07:33.439
and somehow that was linked
to the whole polio campaign.

07:33.525 --> 07:35.475
The United States is acknowledging

07:35.560 --> 07:38.945
that a doctor held in Pakistan
on suspicion of treason

07:39.030 --> 07:43.066
was working for the CIA
to find Osama Bin Laden.

07:43.151 --> 07:46.202
Anderson: <i>Dr. Shakil Afridi,
posing as a vaccinator,</i>

07:46.321 --> 07:47.737
<i>obtained DNA samples</i>

07:47.822 --> 07:50.323
<i>confirming Bin Laden's identity.</i>

07:50.408 --> 07:51.574
<i>He is currently serving</i>

07:51.659 --> 07:54.410
<i>a 33-year prison sentence
in Pakistan.</i>

07:59.334 --> 08:01.801
Anderson: <i>To find out what
affect the Bin Laden raid had,</i>

08:01.886 --> 08:03.219
<i>we went to one of Pakistan's</i>

08:03.338 --> 08:06.472
<i>largest madrassas, Jamia Binoria.</i>

08:14.015 --> 08:15.731
<i>There we met with Mufti Naeem,</i>

08:15.850 --> 08:18.734
<i>one of the country's most
influential Islamic scholars.</i>

08:31.916 --> 08:36.535
After the Bin Laden raid, when the
CIA had used a hepatitis vaccinator

08:36.671 --> 08:38.703
to verify he was living
in that compound,

08:38.789 --> 08:43.042
did more people believe that the polio
vaccine was actually harmful to them?

09:25.136 --> 09:27.096
Anderson: <i>Statements like
these have consequences.</i>

09:27.222 --> 09:30.973
<i>Since 2012, more than 80 polio
workers and their security</i>

09:31.092 --> 09:33.426
<i>have been murdered
for doing this job.</i>

09:33.511 --> 09:36.562
So this is the neighborhood
militant center.

09:36.648 --> 09:39.432
There's a serious amount
of security here...

09:39.567 --> 09:42.685
dozens of heavily armed policemen.

09:42.770 --> 09:44.770
Seems insane that they should need

09:44.906 --> 09:48.024
this much security for such a...

09:48.109 --> 09:50.159
such a noble job.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.945
The entire police force for this area

09:53.081 --> 09:57.116
and some army rangers are
dedicated to their security.

09:57.252 --> 10:00.419
But what do you think about the fact
that you need this much security?

10:04.959 --> 10:07.627
<i>Just two days later,
a suicide bomber attacked</i>

10:07.762 --> 10:09.845
<i>another polio vaccination center...</i>

10:10.965 --> 10:14.217
<i>killing 15 people.</i>

10:14.302 --> 10:18.604
<i>In January of 2014, close to a dozen
gunmen on motorbikes attacked</i>

10:18.690 --> 10:22.775
<i>a polio team in Karachi,
killing three vaccinators.</i>

10:22.860 --> 10:25.778
<i>Salma Jaffar was lucky to survive.</i>

10:51.339 --> 10:54.674
Do you know if they
specifically came after you

10:54.759 --> 10:56.592
and targeted you and your colleagues?

11:09.574 --> 11:12.158
Would you go back to doing
the same work again?

11:18.616 --> 11:21.117
Anderson: <i>Asmat Ara
was attacked in 2015,</i>

11:21.202 --> 11:23.202
<i>when five men broke into her house</i>

11:23.288 --> 11:25.371
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

12:30.188 --> 12:31.868
Did they say anything
throughout the attack

12:31.939 --> 12:36.158
that made you think it was because
of your work as a polio vaccinator?

12:49.957 --> 12:52.341
Do you want to go back to your work,

12:52.460 --> 12:54.927
giving the polio vaccine to children?

13:35.002 --> 13:38.087
<i>Despite these attacks,
exceptionally brave women</i>

13:38.172 --> 13:40.306
<i>keep going out and knocking on doors.</i>

14:04.916 --> 14:08.667
This is Orangi, a Pashtun
neighborhood in Karachi,

14:08.753 --> 14:12.705
which historically has had lots
of resistance to the vaccinators.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.840
Just a year ago,
one of them was assassinated

14:14.926 --> 14:18.043
in this neighborhood
for doing this work.

14:18.179 --> 14:21.881
Immediately after the attack, what
effect did it have on you and your team?

15:16.854 --> 15:19.405
Anderson:
Khalida is just incredible.

15:19.490 --> 15:22.024
To see a woman taking as much
of a leading role as she is,

15:22.109 --> 15:25.611
and arguing back against people
who refuse the vaccine... men...

15:25.696 --> 15:27.947
and bombing around on a quad bike

15:28.032 --> 15:31.083
is unheard of in this area.

15:51.722 --> 15:54.473
Does this make you think
you can convince everybody?

16:01.449 --> 16:03.816
<i>Khalida and her colleagues
have turned things around,</i>

16:03.951 --> 16:08.070
<i>and they are now close to
winning the war against polio.</i>

16:17.999 --> 16:20.215
Anderson: <i>Dr. Elias Durry
has been instrumental</i>

16:20.301 --> 16:22.301
<i>in the global fight
to eradicate polio</i>

16:22.386 --> 16:23.836
<i>for the last two decades.</i>

16:49.030 --> 16:51.947
Earlier this season, we looked
at the devastating effects

16:52.033 --> 16:53.365
<i>that American-made
cluster bombs</i>

16:53.501 --> 16:55.918
<i>were having on the civilian
populations in Yemen.</i>

16:57.622 --> 16:59.588
But we wanted to take
a look at the larger picture

16:59.707 --> 17:02.374
of unexploded munitions
in other parts of the world.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.126
So we went to Southeast Asia,

17:04.211 --> 17:06.845
where millions of these
controversial weapons

17:06.931 --> 17:09.048
are still taking lives, every day.

17:21.395 --> 17:23.729
I just crossed
the Thai-Burmese border.

17:23.814 --> 17:27.066
I'm in... Karen State.

17:27.201 --> 17:29.952
I'm embedded with the KNLA...

17:30.071 --> 17:33.238
that's the Karen National
Liberation Army.

17:33.374 --> 17:37.910
<i>These rebels are locked in a decades-long
civil war with the Burmese government.</i>

17:38.045 --> 17:40.162
<i>Both sides have used
one of the most primitive</i>

17:40.247 --> 17:44.416
<i>but deadly kinds of indiscriminate
weapons: Land mines.</i>

17:45.803 --> 17:48.087
I asked the soldiers
about land mines,

17:48.172 --> 17:49.588
and they produced this.

17:49.724 --> 17:51.507
This is a homemade land mine

17:51.592 --> 17:53.225
that they carry with them.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.811
This little wooden part acts
as a pressure plate.

17:55.930 --> 17:58.263
When somebody steps on it,
this thing goes boom.

17:58.399 --> 18:00.265
<i>But the problem with these
homemade weapons</i>

18:00.351 --> 18:03.936
<i>and the military-grade explosives that
the Burmese government is planting,</i>

18:04.071 --> 18:08.190
<i>is that it's often the civilian
population who sees their impact.</i>

18:13.447 --> 18:16.749
<i>In nearby villages, we met some
of these civilian victims.</i>

18:36.387 --> 18:38.137
<i>These weapons are often used in areas</i>

18:38.272 --> 18:42.441
<i>where the local people lack the proper
resources to treat their condition.</i>

18:42.526 --> 18:45.644
<i>So for victims in Burma,
that often means traveling</i>

18:45.780 --> 18:48.397
<i>to neighboring Thailand
just to get help.</i>

18:52.653 --> 18:56.789
<i>Ma Mya Win was 18 when she
triggered a land mine.</i>

19:21.515 --> 19:24.933
<i>The Hpa-an Clinic has
provided physical therapy</i>

19:25.019 --> 19:28.153
<i>to hundreds of land mine
victims in the last decade.</i>

19:28.239 --> 19:30.906
<i>Many of them show up with
crude, makeshift prosthetics</i>

19:31.025 --> 19:32.991
<i>that they've constructed
on their own.</i>

19:33.828 --> 19:34.943
These are homemade prosthetics?

19:40.201 --> 19:42.367
And this is just a rod and...

19:42.453 --> 19:45.037
and a ball bearing.

19:45.122 --> 19:46.171
Crazy.

19:47.792 --> 19:50.125
<i>These limbs are in constant demand,</i>

19:50.211 --> 19:52.628
<i>because, as Dr. Yeshua Moser
explained to us,</i>

19:52.713 --> 19:54.763
<i>the threat from unexploded ordnance</i>

19:54.882 --> 19:57.966
<i>can last for decades
after a conflict is over.</i>

19:58.052 --> 20:01.053
Anti-personnel mines aren't
something that spoils like milk.

20:01.138 --> 20:04.439
Because of the extraordinary
number of civilians

20:04.558 --> 20:07.943
that were injured and killed
by these things in peacetime,

20:08.062 --> 20:11.230
it's what we call a weapon of
mass destruction in slow motion.

20:11.365 --> 20:12.865
That brings us to Burma's neighbor.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.449
Right next door, you have Laos.

20:14.568 --> 20:18.153
Slightly different problem, but
still a very deadly problem, right?

20:18.239 --> 20:22.457
Yes. In Laos you have much more
of a cluster-munition problem

20:22.576 --> 20:25.794
due to the aerial bombing they
experienced during the war.

20:27.047 --> 20:28.914
Larsen: <i>That war was the Vietnam War,</i>

20:28.999 --> 20:33.585
<i>and the country dropping those deadly
weapons was the United States.</i>

20:33.721 --> 20:34.721
<i>In an effort to halt</i>

20:34.755 --> 20:37.306
<i>enemy supply lines
that ran through Laos,</i>

20:37.424 --> 20:39.975
<i>the US began carpet bombing
this small country</i>

20:40.094 --> 20:42.261
<i>using a highly controversial weapon</i>

20:42.396 --> 20:43.896
<i>known as a cluster bomb,</i>

20:43.981 --> 20:45.597
<i>which breaks apart in mid-air</i>

20:45.683 --> 20:49.101
<i>into dozens of smaller explosives.</i>

20:49.236 --> 20:52.521
<i>The problem is, not all of these
bomblets actually explode,</i>

20:52.606 --> 20:56.358
<i>essentially making them land
mines dropped from the sky.</i>

21:00.497 --> 21:02.080
I'm in Savannakhet Province, Laos.

21:02.166 --> 21:05.751
This area is one of the most heavily
bombed regions in the world.

21:05.836 --> 21:09.955
During the Vietnam War, the US dropped
more ordnance on this teeny country

21:10.090 --> 21:13.759
than they did on all of the
Axis powers in World War II.

21:13.844 --> 21:17.629
<i>This has left millions
of unexploded ordnance</i>

21:17.765 --> 21:19.798
<i>in the ground here in Laos.</i>

21:22.386 --> 21:24.553
Nick Torbet: Yesterday, there
was an accident in a bow,

21:24.638 --> 21:27.306
a local person blew off his hand.

21:27.391 --> 21:29.725
Larsen: <i>Nick Torbet runs
the Laos branch of HALO,</i>

21:29.810 --> 21:31.526
<i>an organization that has cleared</i>

21:31.645 --> 21:33.979
<i>tens of thousands
of explosives in Laos.</i>

21:34.114 --> 21:37.232
<i>He explained to us
how cluster munitions work.</i>

21:37.318 --> 21:39.117
A cluster munition is designed
to explode on impact,

21:39.203 --> 21:41.163
so it's designed like
an artillery shell or bomb...

21:41.205 --> 21:42.321
it's to hit the ground, go bang.

21:42.456 --> 21:44.990
But a fairly large number
didn't explode.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.410
<i>The BLU-26, they were
dropped in containers</i>

21:48.495 --> 21:51.163
<i>containing hundreds of these
in an individual bomb</i>

21:51.248 --> 21:52.881
<i>that would break up in the sky</i>

21:53.000 --> 21:55.133
<i>and hundreds of these
would fall towards the ground,</i>

21:55.219 --> 21:57.169
<i>spinning in the air,
and then impact on landing.</i>

21:57.304 --> 22:00.055
You can see the small little
ball bearings within it,

22:00.174 --> 22:02.090
and the idea is
these ball bearings spread out

22:02.176 --> 22:06.094
and become a fragmentation
designed to kill people.

22:06.180 --> 22:08.347
Is there a render-safe
procedure for these?

22:08.432 --> 22:09.598
No, for cluster ammunitions,

22:09.683 --> 22:11.149
you can't really render them safe.

22:11.235 --> 22:13.518
You can use, you know,
explosive effects

22:13.654 --> 22:16.188
to make them explode
in a less violent way.

22:17.691 --> 22:19.574
Larsen: <i>Nick took us out on
one of his group's missions</i>

22:19.693 --> 22:21.610
<i>to the remote village of Nahuanam.</i>

22:24.665 --> 22:26.698
<i>For more than 40 years,
Nahuanam has dealt</i>

22:26.834 --> 22:30.168
<i>with the leftover cluster munitions
surrounding their village.</i>

22:32.122 --> 22:34.706
HALO actually has to set up a
base camp from which to operate.

22:34.792 --> 22:36.872
They've done that in this village.
This tent behind us

22:36.927 --> 22:38.877
is where they'll live
for the next three weeks.

22:38.963 --> 22:41.430
<i>But before we could
even begin our search,</i>

22:41.548 --> 22:44.599
<i>a local elder pointed us
to an armed American bomblet,</i>

22:44.718 --> 22:47.102
<i>which was just a few
hundred feet from camp.</i>

22:47.221 --> 22:50.389
He's leading us to where he
thinks he found it right now.

22:52.559 --> 22:53.859
How did you find this?

22:56.397 --> 22:58.981
Do you know people who have
been hurt by these before?

23:13.964 --> 23:16.915
Larsen: <i>We watched as HALO prepared
a safe detonation procedure</i>

23:17.051 --> 23:20.585
<i>for this unexploded ordnance
just paces from the village.</i>

23:29.063 --> 23:31.063
So basically what's happening
now is, as you can see,

23:31.148 --> 23:32.597
there's farmers, there's villagers,

23:32.683 --> 23:34.043
there's a village right over there.

23:34.101 --> 23:37.402
So Davondan is spreading
his team out, deploying them,

23:37.488 --> 23:40.989
to warn off people that there's
about to be an explosion.

23:51.201 --> 23:53.118
Larsen: This container has
the blasting caps in them.

23:53.253 --> 23:54.836
Once he takes that blasting cap

23:54.955 --> 23:57.122
and he puts it right into
the top of this explosive,

23:57.207 --> 23:59.257
it's placed down in the hole

23:59.343 --> 24:02.677
and explodes that bomb,
hopefully in a safe manner.

24:29.239 --> 24:30.822
There's nothing left of it

24:30.958 --> 24:33.158
except for these
little ball bearings,

24:33.243 --> 24:35.243
which are actually still hot
from the explosion.

24:35.329 --> 24:38.547
These are what are designed
to shred flesh, right here.

24:38.632 --> 24:40.382
<i>Where one bomblet is found,</i>

24:40.501 --> 24:42.634
<i>there's almost always more nearby,</i>

24:42.719 --> 24:45.754
<i>so the team has
to search the entire area.</i>

24:49.009 --> 24:51.309
Their job is to map contamination.

24:51.395 --> 24:54.513
The team leader, Bandra, set out
a small 50-by-50 meter box,

24:54.648 --> 24:58.016
and they all work in towards the
center, doing a sweep of the area.

25:02.689 --> 25:04.022
Oh, there's another one?

25:04.158 --> 25:07.943
It's the same type of
munition, another BLU-26.

25:16.003 --> 25:17.003
Here's another one.

25:23.343 --> 25:24.903
Larsen: <i>And it isn't
just cluster bombs.</i>

25:25.012 --> 25:28.880
<i>The area is littered with
unexploded ordnance of all types.</i>

25:38.525 --> 25:40.442
<i>And these hidden bombs
are so pervasive</i>

25:40.561 --> 25:43.895
<i>that a new generation has
had to learn to spot them.</i>

25:48.735 --> 25:50.452
They're leading us to it right now.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.310
Oh yeah, there it is right there.

25:55.826 --> 25:57.209
Do you know where these came from?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.833
<i>This is why explosives
like land mines</i>

26:04.918 --> 26:06.885
<i>and cluster munitions
are so dangerous...</i>

26:06.970 --> 26:10.055
<i>because decades
after a conflict ends,</i>

26:10.140 --> 26:12.841
<i>the original victims,
as well as their children</i>

26:12.926 --> 26:16.144
<i>and grandchildren are
still paying a price.</i>

26:40.587 --> 26:44.256
<i>Even though HALO is working
constantly to neutralize these bombs,</i>

26:44.341 --> 26:46.341
<i>there are still millions more.</i>

26:46.460 --> 26:48.426
<i>And there will continue
to be millions more</i>

26:48.512 --> 26:50.262
<i>to neutralize around the world</i>

26:50.347 --> 26:52.964
<i>because American-made
cluster munitions</i>

26:53.100 --> 26:55.517
<i>are still being dropped today.</i>

26:55.636 --> 26:58.637
<i>Despite international calls
to stop using these weapons,</i>

26:58.772 --> 27:01.690
<i>the US has used them
in both Iraq and Afghanistan,</i>

27:01.808 --> 27:04.609
<i>and has armed Saudi Arabia
with the bombs</i>

27:04.695 --> 27:07.862
<i>it's used on highly populated
areas in Yemen.</i>

27:08.982 --> 27:10.031
<i>For more than two decades,</i>

27:10.150 --> 27:12.150
<i>Senator Patrick Leahy has crusaded</i>

27:12.236 --> 27:14.653
<i>against the use of these
indiscriminate explosives.</i>

27:14.788 --> 27:16.738
You buy these for $3 or $4.

27:16.823 --> 27:20.659
This much pressure
would have taken my arm

27:20.794 --> 27:23.328
and, in this case,
most of my head off.

27:23.463 --> 27:25.380
Larsen:
<i>Senator Leahy told us</i>

27:25.499 --> 27:27.882
<i>the US needs to take
a leadership role</i>

27:28.001 --> 27:29.467
<i>in banning these weapons.</i>

27:29.553 --> 27:32.387
If we're not willing
to give up these things...

27:32.506 --> 27:35.473
isn't it easier for a country that
has nowhere near our power to say,

27:35.559 --> 27:36.925
"Wait a minute.
The most powerful nation

27:37.010 --> 27:39.678
on Earth won't do it,
why should we?"

27:41.565 --> 27:43.598
We have some
in the Pentagon who think

27:43.684 --> 27:46.685
that you should
never limit any weapon.

27:46.770 --> 27:48.687
There are those,
after World War I, that said,

27:48.822 --> 27:50.739
"Well, maybe we shouldn't
ban poison gas.

27:50.857 --> 27:53.775
<i>We might need it
at some point."</i>

27:53.860 --> 27:58.363
No. It's a human rights need to get
rid of it, and we didn't need it.

27:58.498 --> 28:01.666
The war is over.
Land mines are still there.

28:01.752 --> 28:05.506
How many generations are
going to continue to die

28:05.626 --> 28:07.455
because they were used?

28:07.831 --> 28:18.239
