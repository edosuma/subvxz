WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:10.378
IT JUST FEELS SO WEIRD

00:10.411 --> 00:12.580
COMIN' BACK FROM
ATLANTIC CITY WITH MONEY.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.249
HA HA HA.
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.651
OH, GOD. THIS SEAT
IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.586
OH, I KNOW WHY.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.156
'CAUSE I'M SITTING
ON A GIGANTIC WAD OF CASH!

00:23.224 --> 00:24.825
DO YOU MIND?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.693
EXCUSE ME?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.361
THIS BUS
IS FULL OF LOSERS.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.798
WE DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU WON.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.266
HEY, MAN. LISTEN.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.434
HERE'S 5 BUCKS.

00:33.467 --> 00:37.205
WHY DON'T YOU GO
SIT UP BY THE DRIVER?

00:38.539 --> 00:41.142
WHOO!
ATLANTIC CITY ROCKS!

00:41.175 --> 00:42.042
YEAH.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.512
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
LEAVING THE KIDS ALONE.

00:44.545 --> 00:48.482
COME ON, BABY.
WE NEEDED THIS VACATION.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.451
AH!
UHH!

00:50.484 --> 00:53.754
MOM, I CAN'T GET ANY SLEEP.
HENRY KEEPS TURNING
THE LIGHT ON.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.824
HONEY, TURN OFF
THE LIGHT.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.259
I CAN'T!

00:58.292 --> 01:00.094
THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN
WANTS MY HEAD.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.295
OH, HENRY. THAT
WAS JUST A MOVIE.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.664
SWEETIE, ARE WE
GONNA GO THROUGH THIS
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.566
TILL THEY CATCH HIM, YES.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.635
ALL RIGHT. CLIMB IN.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.672
THAT'S FOR ME.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.573
HELLO?

01:12.606 --> 01:13.741
WHO'S CALLING YOU
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING?

01:13.774 --> 01:17.411
YES, I'LL
ACCEPT THE CHARGES.

01:17.445 --> 01:21.582
HA HA. I'M NOT SAYING
IT WASN'T VERY NICE
TO GET AWAY.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.252
I JUST HOPE
THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.619
I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.255
THEY'RE WITH EDDIE.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.456
SO? WE GOT MONEY NOW.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.559
WE DON'T NEED THE KIDS
TO MAKE US HAPPY.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.526
COME ON.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.429
HEY, COME ON.
EDDIE WAS REALLY
INTO THE IDEA.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.566
BESIDES, WE DIDN'T
HAVE THAT MANY CHOICES.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.370
OH, GOD. COME ON, DAD.
YOU'RE SICK.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.537
NO, I'M NOT.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.674
LOOK, IT'S OK.
WE'LL GO TO ATLANTIC CITY
SOME OTHER TIME.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.541
WHAT ABOUT ME?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.277
WHAT

01:49.310 --> 01:50.411
I'D TAKE A WHACK AT IT.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.880
Sean: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE HOME.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.182
I CAN SEE OUR HOUSE.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.649
Claudia: IS IT ON FIRE?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.285
UH, LET ME SEE.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.186
NOT VISIBLY.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.853
ALL RIGHT, EDDIE!

02:01.255 --> 02:02.323
YEOW! WHOO!

02:02.356 --> 02:03.691
HA HA!

02:03.724 --> 02:05.926
HI. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE COMIN' HOME TOMORROW.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.629
NO, WE DECIDED TO QUIT
WHEN WE WERE AHEAD.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.700
HOW'S EVERYTHING HERE?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.935
HERE
EVERYTHING'S GREAT HERE.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.438
JUST TAKING OUT
SOME GARBAGE.

02:20.808 --> 02:25.145
YOU GUYS NEED
STRONGER BAGS, YOU KNOW?

02:38.726 --> 02:39.593
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED, EDDIE?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.862
I JUST HAD KENNY OVER.
WE WATCHED THE GAME.

02:41.895 --> 02:48.436
SO, WHAT, YOU AND KENNY
EACH HAD, LIKE, 47 BEERS?

02:48.469 --> 02:50.771
KENNY HAS A PROBLEM.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.806
UHHHH! I GOTTA GO!

02:52.840 --> 02:55.209
WE'RE OUT
OF MAYONNAISE!

02:55.243 --> 02:56.710
WHAT THE HELL
IS DAD DOING HERE?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.679
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
LOOKING AT IT.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.449
OH, MY GOD.
HE REEKS OF COUGH SYRUP.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.452
AND YOU JUST REEK.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.520
THAT'S COLOGNE, ED.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.422
THE STINK IS GETTING
INTO MY MOUTH.

03:08.456 --> 03:11.392
LOOK, EDDIE.
JUST TELL ME
THE BOYS ARE ALL RIGHT.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.262
OH, YEAH. THEY'RE FINE.
I HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP
OUT OF THEM.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.298
OK. I GOT ALL
THE CANS OUT--

03:17.331 --> 03:18.599
HEH.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.267
HELLO.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.669
SO, WHAT YOU
GOT THERE, LILY?

03:21.702 --> 03:22.803
UH, RECYCLING.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.939
JUST TAKING OUT
THE RECYCLING,
YOU KNOW?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.408
SAVIN'
THE EARTH.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.175
HA HA.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.010
COME ON. WE KNOW
THERE WAS A PARTY.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.646
I DID NOT
THROW A PARTY.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.381
REALLY?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.449
YES. THE PARTY
WAS THROWN AT ME.

03:35.483 --> 03:39.320
SO, MY PARENTS ARE GOING
OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEKEND.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.654
THEY ARE?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.355
YEAH.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.424
I'LL HAVE THE HOUSE
TO MYSELF

03:43.457 --> 03:46.394
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

03:46.427 --> 03:50.331
HEH HEH. OH, YEAH.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.613
DOESN'T ANYBODY
CHECK I.D. ANYMORE?

04:05.646 --> 04:08.649
HOW DO KIDS GET
THEIR HANDS ON OBSCENE
QUANTITIES OF BEER?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.818
THEY GOT IT FROM
OUR REFRIGERATOR.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.620
THAT WAS MY BEER?!

04:14.455 --> 04:16.857
OH, GOD. THEY ATE
THE PEANUT BUTTER
AND THE ONIONS,

04:16.890 --> 04:20.060
AND WHAT THE HELL?
WAS SOMEBODY EATING
THE BAKING SODA?

04:20.093 --> 04:24.532
THEY PROBABLY WANTED
TO FRESHEN THEIR BREATH
AFTER THEY PUKED.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.300
OH, GOD.
SOMEBODY PUKED?

04:26.334 --> 04:27.968
YEAH, IN THE MEAT DRAWER.

04:28.001 --> 04:28.936
OHH!

04:28.969 --> 04:31.772
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
YOU BABY-SIT.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.806
WHAT

04:32.840 --> 04:35.008
LOOK AROUND.
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.745
I WAS ON TOP OF THINGS.
I GOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.012
BY WHAT?

04:39.046 --> 04:42.015
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL
WHO WORKS IN A BOOKSTORE
BY THE COFFEE SHOP?

04:42.049 --> 04:42.916
NO.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.719
I'VE BEEN WOOING HER.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.156
HI.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.925
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE
YOUR HOME IMPROVEMENT
SECTION IS?

04:51.959 --> 04:57.465
I AM THINKING OF
INSTALLING A JACUZZI
IN MY PENTHOUSE.

04:57.698 --> 05:02.936
DO YOU HAVE
A SELF-HELP SECTION FOR
THE HOPELESSLY ROMANTIC?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.640
I'VE MASTERED THIS ONE.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.809
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
MORE CHALLENGING?

05:08.842 --> 05:12.012
YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE
WITH MORE ENDURANCE.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.481
AISLE 4.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.115
ASK FOR JIM.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.117
JIM? OK.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.753
SO WHAT? YOU GET
SHOT DOWN ALL THE TIME.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.655
FIRST OF ALL, THAT HURT.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.423
SECOND OF ALL,

05:22.456 --> 05:25.058
THINGS TOOK A TURN
FOR THE BETTER.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.395
HEY, LOOK.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.062
A BOOK ON CRAPS.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.465
I GOTTA SEE THIS.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.101
HEY, WHAT'S
WITH ALL THE DICE?

05:34.134 --> 05:37.538
COME ON, GUYS.
I'LL SHOW YOU
THE ART PHOTOS.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.140
NAH.
I DON'T LIKE ART.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.742
YOU'LL LIKE THESE.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.011
ART ROCKS.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.414
HI.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.515
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

05:47.548 --> 05:51.084
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE PEOPLE
READING WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.621
OH. THEY'RE NOT MINE.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.688
OH.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.458
I MEAN, THEY'RE
BASICALLY MINE.
I AM THEIR UNCLE,

05:57.491 --> 05:59.793
BUT THEIR FATHER,
YOU KNOW...

05:59.827 --> 06:01.895
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM?

06:01.929 --> 06:02.796
UH-HUH.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.932
THAT'S SO SWEET.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.367
HOW OLD ARE THEY?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.504
8 AND 4.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.105
I'LL BE 13 IN APRIL.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.741
I'M 27.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.176
AH HA HA! HE'S ADORABLE.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.446
HE GETS THAT
FROM HIS UNCLE.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.113
OH.

06:20.648 --> 06:23.684
NO WONDER YOU WANTED
TO KEEP THE BOYS
THIS WEEKEND.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.118
IT WAS PERFECTLY INNOCENT.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.754
YOU USED THEM AS BAIT.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.189
OK. THEY WERE BAIT,

06:29.222 --> 06:32.025
BUT THEY
HAD A GOOD TIME.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.962
WOW. I'VE NEVER
HAD SO MUCH SUGAR.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.565
I'M STARTING
TO SEE NEW COLORS.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.800
IT'S JUST GOOD
TO SEE THEM EAT.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.670
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU MADE ME OUT
TO THIS WOMAN

06:42.703 --> 06:45.439
AS SOME KIND OF DRUNK
WHO STARVES
HIS CHILDREN?

06:45.473 --> 06:46.607
NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.943
IT'S A CHARACTER
I INVENTED. "EVIL SEAN."

06:49.977 --> 06:52.145
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
HE'S HARSHIN' ON ME.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.114
YOU TOTALLY DROPPED
THE BALL, EDDIE.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.315
NO, I DID YOU A FAVOR.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.151
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTED TO TRY OUT
YOUR BLACKJACK SYSTEM.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.987
OH, GOD.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.855
DON'T TALK
ABOUT THE SYSTEM.

07:01.889 --> 07:06.694
ALL HE COULD TALK ABOUT
THE WHOLE TIME
WAS HIS STUPID SYSTEM.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.562
AH, YES.
HERE WE ARE.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.763
SLOT MACHINES.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.064
OH, COME ON.

07:11.098 --> 07:11.965
WHAT?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.166
I'M GOOD AT SLOTS.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.635
OH, PLEASE.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.302
I AM.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.137
YOU CAN'T BE GOOD
AT SLOTS.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.205
WELL, I AM.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.339
LOOK, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS "GOOD AT SLOTS," OK?

07:19.372 --> 07:22.843
IT'S TOTALLY RANDOM.
A MONKEY COULD
WIN MONEY AT SLOTS.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.178
YES, IF THE MONKEY
WERE GOOD AT SLOTS.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.180
OH, GOD. COME ON,
IT'S A GAME OF CHANCE.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.183
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
A GAME OF SKILL
LIKE BLACKJACK?

07:30.217 --> 07:30.984
I GOT A SYSTEM.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.085
YES. YES, I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.087
WELL, APPARENTLY,
YOU WEREN'T LISTENING
TOO CLOSELY,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.824
'CAUSE YOU STILL INSIST
ON THROWING MONEY AWAY
ON SLOTS!

07:36.857 --> 07:39.126
WHICH I'M GOOD AT.
YOU CAN'T BE!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.561
WATCH ME.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.262
WELL, I WON $85.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.263
THAT'S
"GOOD AT SLOTS."

07:43.296 --> 07:46.500
WHOA. WELL,
HOW MUCH DID I WIN
WITH MY SYSTEM?

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
WAIT A MINUTE. WHOA!

07:47.801 --> 07:51.672
IT'S ALMOST TOO HEAVY
TO HOLD! AAH!

07:51.705 --> 07:52.673
AAH!

07:52.706 --> 07:53.707
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.275
WHILE YOU TWO
WERE IN ATLANTIC CITY

07:55.308 --> 07:58.178
SIPPING DOM PERIGNON OUT
OF EACH OTHER'S SHOES,
GUESS WHERE I WAS.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.781
I WAS RIGHT HERE,
PROTECTING
THE LITTLE ONES,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.283
SIPPING NOTHING
FROM NOBODY'S SHOES.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.119
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE DO APPRECIATE IT.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.154
THANKS, EDDIE.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.188
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:08.956 --> 08:12.225
Jimmy: UNCLE EDDIE,
IS THAT YOU?

08:14.027 --> 08:14.828
YEAH.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.864
Jimmy: LET US OUT OF HERE!

08:16.897 --> 08:17.665
Henry: PLEASE!

08:17.698 --> 08:22.102
ARE THE BOYS
LOCKED IN THE BASEMENT?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.838
I DON'T THINK SO.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.644
WHOA.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.180
OH, IT'S SO BRIGHT.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.318
OH, MY GOD.
HEY, FIRST RULE
OF BABY-SITTING:

08:38.351 --> 08:40.888
DON'T LOCK
THE CHILDREN
IN THE BASEMENT.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.857
GO EASY ON THEM.
THEY'RE KIDS.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.129
DAD. DAD.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.098
YOU REALLY SMELL.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.100
IT'S COLOGNE.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.937
OK, COME ON, GUYS.
I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.005
ALL RIGHT, EDDIE.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.108
SO, HOW EXACTLY DID THEY
GET LOCKED IN THE BASEMENT?

09:01.141 --> 09:01.975
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.944
WE WERE HANGING OUT,
HAVING A GOOD TIME,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.279
BUT AT SOME POINT,
MY APARTMENT JUST BECAME

09:06.313 --> 09:08.215
AN UNSUITABLE
ENVIRONMENT.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.320
UH, HENRY,
CLOSE YOUR CLUB FACE.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.956
YOU'RE HITTING IT
OFF THE TOE.

09:15.989 --> 09:16.724
WOW.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.859
YOU ARE SO GOOD
WITH YOUR NEPHEWS.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.794
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO BE.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.862
HEH HEH.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.963
OW!

09:22.996 --> 09:23.697
WHOA.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.000
COME ON. KEEP IT
IN THE FAIRWAY.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.002
YOU OK?

09:29.036 --> 09:29.870
YEAH, I'M FINE.

09:29.903 --> 09:34.842
SO, DO YOU WATCH THE BOYS
ALL THE TIME?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.109
OH, YEAH.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.978
NO, I MEAN,

09:38.011 --> 09:41.281
ALL THE TIME?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.985
COME ON. LET'S GO.
TIME TO GO.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.287
BUT I'M 3 UNDER!
MOVE IT.

09:54.027 --> 09:54.928
WHAT THE--

09:54.962 --> 09:57.865
THANK YOU, LILY.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.034
NOOOOOO!

10:01.068 --> 10:05.939
WELL, IT WAS NICE OF YOU
NOT TO JUST SHOVE THEM
OUT OF A MOVING CAR.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.942
LOOK, WHAT I DID WAS
IN THEIR BEST INTEREST

10:08.976 --> 10:11.945
AND MINE
AND MY LADY FRIEND'S.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.314
IT WAS A WIN-WIN-WIN.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.683
WOW.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.084
$860.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.220
MOM? IF YOU PUT ALL THIS
IN MY COLLEGE FUND,

10:20.253 --> 10:24.958
I WOULD HAVE $868.

10:25.726 --> 10:29.997
YEAH, JIMMY.
ABOUT THOSE $8.00...

10:30.030 --> 10:32.365
MOM, WHO'S JOAN?

10:32.399 --> 10:33.667
WHO?

10:33.701 --> 10:36.069
JOAN IN ROOM 608.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.105
WHAT IS THAT?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.040
I FOUND IT
IN WITH DAD'S MONEY.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.410
I DON'T KNOW
ANYONE NAMED JOAN.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.411
WELL, SHE KISSED
THIS NAPKIN.

10:44.444 --> 10:49.750
THINK. WHO DO YOU KNOW
WHO REALLY LOVES
NAPKINS?

10:50.417 --> 10:54.054
LILY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOUR BROTHERS ARE?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.388
YEAH, THEY'RE--

10:55.422 --> 10:56.857
THEY'RE--

10:56.890 --> 10:57.524
OH, MY GOD.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.093
UH-UH-UH-UH.
WE LET 'EM OUT.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.095
WHAT THE HELL WERE
YOU THINKING, LIL?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.097
DAD, I WAS OVERWHELMED.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.247
DEAN, WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT MY PARENTS WERE
GONNA BE OUT OF TOWN,

11:20.280 --> 11:24.017
I MEANT THAT WE COULD
SPEND THE EVENING TOGETHER.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.485
JUST THE TWO OF US.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.787
OH.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.889
OH!

11:28.922 --> 11:31.925
PARTY, MAN! COME ON!

11:33.861 --> 11:36.096
GIVE ME THAT.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.071
HELLO?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.072
LILY.

11:45.105 --> 11:49.376
WELL, I JUST HAD SOME
COUGH MEDICINE, AND, UH--

11:49.409 --> 11:50.043
WHAT?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.179
OH, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WORRY.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.982
IF I TAKE SOME
OF THE NON-DROWSY,

11:55.015 --> 11:57.818
I'M SURE
IT'LL BALANCE OUT.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.222
OH, GRANDPA.
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.192
I'M SO SORRY
TO WAKE YOU UP, BUT
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.096
DON'T BE SILLY.
I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.165
HEY,
IS THAT CHITA RIVERA?

12:12.199 --> 12:14.201
I OWE HER
A PUNCH IN THE NOSE!

12:14.234 --> 12:18.071
GRANDPA! I NEED YOU
TO GET ALL THESE PEOPLE
OUT OF HERE.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.139
I GOT IT.

12:19.172 --> 12:24.211
OK. THE MUSIC IS GOING OFF.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.984
RIGHT AFTER THIS SONG...

12:31.018 --> 12:36.056
WHICH I LIKE VERY MUCH.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.926
OH, GRANDPA.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.928
I'M GREAT.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.363
OH, CRAP.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.232
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.567
I WAS JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR MY LITTLE BROTHERS.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.204
COME ON, LILY.
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
DOING IT OUT IN THE YARD

12:51.238 --> 12:53.173
IF THEY DIDN'T
WANT PEOPLE TO WATCH.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.575
UHH. GET
IN THE BASEMENT.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.543
WHAT IF WE GET HUNGRY?

12:56.576 --> 12:59.279
THERE'S A FREEZER
FULL OF MEAT.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.050
DON'T THINK OF IT AS
"LOCKED IN THE BASEMENT."

13:03.083 --> 13:05.785
THINK OF IT AS
"PROTECTIVE CUSTODY."

13:06.286 --> 13:07.354
SEAN?
YEAH.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.123
HI. WHEN I WAS
PLAYING THE SLOTS,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.124
I WAS PLAYING BLACKJACK.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.960
YEAH, WHO'S JOAN?
AH?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.962
JOAN.
I DON'T KNOW A JOAN.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.998
JOAN. JOAN. JOAN,
ROOM 608,

13:18.031 --> 13:19.266
WITH THE BURGUNDY
LIPSTICK!

13:19.299 --> 13:22.135
OH, WOW.
I'VE GOT NO IDEA.

13:22.169 --> 13:22.702
OH, COME--

13:22.735 --> 13:24.337
IT WAS
IN YOUR POCKET.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.374
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WEAR THESE PANTS.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.344
MY GOD.
NO WONDER YOU SMELL
LIKE CHEAP PERFUME.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.047
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.283
SEE, I DID GO OVER
TO THE BLACKJACK TABLES.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.217
YEAH

13:37.250 --> 13:40.153
TRUTH BE TOLD, MY SYSTEM
WASN'T AS FOOLPROOF

13:40.187 --> 13:42.022
AS I MAY HAVE IMPLIED.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.490
200. COLOR ME.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.191
COCKTAILS?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.560
I THINK I'LL
HAVE A LOWENBRAU.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.963
THANK YOU. HEH.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.637
QUEEN-5,
DEALER SHOWING 7.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.973
HIT ME.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.175

14:02.209 --> 14:04.144
IT'S OK. JUST STARTIN'.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.578
HA HA HA HA.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.615

14:17.224 --> 14:19.659
HIT ME, MAMA.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.428
OHH!

14:23.430 --> 14:25.198

14:29.402 --> 14:31.404
OK. 2 COWBOYS.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.273
I STAY.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.076
WHAT?

14:37.544 --> 14:40.313
HERE'S YOUR BEER.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.317
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.486
THAT BORES ME.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.121
WHO IS JOAN?!

14:48.155 --> 14:50.557
YOU DROVE ME TO JOAN.
WHAT?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.359
I COULDN'T FACE YOU.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.360
WHY NOT?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.628
BECAUSE
YOU WERE WINNING.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.967
WHOO! HA HA HA HA!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.334
HA HA HA!

15:01.368 --> 15:03.203
I'M GONNA NEED
ANOTHER BUCKET!

15:03.236 --> 15:08.041
WOW, YOU'RE
REALLY GOOD AT SLOTS!

15:09.342 --> 15:12.012
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT,
YOU LOSER?!

15:12.045 --> 15:13.413
YOU IDIOT!

15:13.446 --> 15:15.182
"I'VE GOT A SYSTEM!"

15:15.215 --> 15:16.449
TOWEL?

15:16.483 --> 15:19.252
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.254
COLOGNE?
NO. I'M FINE.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.289
MOUTHWASH?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.524
NO. THANK YOU.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.070
CASH PLAYS.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.207
COME ON. COME ON!

15:40.407 --> 15:42.242
DAMN IT!

15:42.275 --> 15:45.412
THAT'S ME! HEY,
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, RED?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.379
I'M GOING HOME.
I'M BROKE.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.682
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.984
KEEP ROLLIN'.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.685
YOU SURE?
ROLL.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.221
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.155
LET'S GO!

15:55.188 --> 15:57.957
LET'S GO.
COME ON, BABY!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.127
YEAH! WHOO!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.461

16:01.494 --> 16:02.629
AH HA HA HA!

16:02.662 --> 16:05.565
LET IT RIDE!
LET IT RIDE!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.435
ALL RIGHT!

16:08.468 --> 16:09.336
WHOO-HOO!

16:09.369 --> 16:13.473
THIS IS WHAT
I LIKE TO CALL
"THE CRICKET."

16:13.506 --> 16:15.042
YEAH!
OHH!

16:15.075 --> 16:17.477
WE'RE LETTIN' IT
RIDE TONIGHT!

16:18.478 --> 16:20.380
YES! WHOO!

16:20.413 --> 16:22.315
ALL RIGHT.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.784
YES!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

16:24.817 --> 16:27.354
YES!
YEAH!

16:27.387 --> 16:28.655
WHOA.

16:28.688 --> 16:34.261

16:38.465 --> 16:40.400
WELL, HEY.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.768
HUH? HA HA HA.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.670
WELL, RED,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.772
THAT WAS
A HELL OF A RUN.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.774
THANK YOU. THANKS. YEAH.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.575
HERE.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.642
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.380
OH, I COULDN'T.
I--OH, MY GOD.
THESE ARE HUNDREDS.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.381
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.815
WELL, THANK YOU.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.352
SAY, RED.
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
TO MY ROOM TONIGHT,

16:59.386 --> 17:00.820
AND WE'LL CELEBRATE,
HUH?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.389
OH, I CAN'T.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.690
I'M MARRIED.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.459
SO AM I.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.765
JUST IN CASE
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.234
OK.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.368
THANK YOU.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.437
OK.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.240
OH, MY GOD.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.176
YOU'RE A HO.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.845
I AM NOT A HO.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.315
WHAT ELSE WOULD
YOU CALL IT?

17:28.348 --> 17:28.948
BOY-TOY.

17:28.981 --> 17:32.185
NO. I WAS
A LUCK-BRINGER.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.253
HEH HEH.
YOU'RE A HO.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.756
HEY. YOU KNEW WHAT I WAS
WHEN YOU MARRIED ME, WOMAN!

17:36.789 --> 17:37.590
COME ON.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.427
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU,
AND YOU TOOK MONEY

17:40.460 --> 17:41.228
FROM
SOME BATHROOM GUY?

17:41.261 --> 17:44.431
OK, HOLD ON.
GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.406
* DA DA DA

17:53.440 --> 17:56.476
* PA DA DA DA DA

17:57.544 --> 17:58.578
TOWEL.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.547
OH, YEAH. THANK YOU.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.649
OH, AND,
UH, MY GOOD MAN.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.118
THIS...

18:05.152 --> 18:06.453
THIS IS FOR YOU.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.654
50 BUCKS?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.423
YEAH, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I HAD A GOOD NIGHT.
HEH HEH HEH.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.292
YOU'RE NO HIGH ROLLER.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.295
YOU'RE
NOT EVEN A ROLLER.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.563
SURE I AM.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.566
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOOK MY 5 BUCKS.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.435
OH, NO, NO.
I--I--I INVESTED IT FOR YOU.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.604
YOU LOUSY SON OF A--

18:24.637 --> 18:26.606
AAAH!

18:26.639 --> 18:29.176
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LIED JUST SO
YOU COULD PRETEND

18:29.209 --> 18:32.379
YOU WERE BETTER
AT BLACKJACK
THAN I AM AT SLOTS.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.246
OK. I MIGHT SUCK
AT BLACKJACK,

18:33.280 --> 18:36.483
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO BE GOOD AT SLOTS.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.250
I WON, DIDN'T I?

18:37.284 --> 18:40.620
YEAH, BUT NOT
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.488
I WON, DIDN'T I?

18:41.521 --> 18:43.756
FINE, ALL RIGHT?
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.425
I WON, DIDN'T I?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.328
OK, STOP IT!
HA HA HA!

18:48.361 --> 18:50.230
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.631
TONIGHT SUCKED
FOR ME, TOO.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.467
YOU KNOW,
CAN'T YOU THINK
OF ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.269
YES, I CAN.
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

18:56.303 --> 19:01.174
NOW YOU GOTTA HEAR ME OUT.
I MADE A HUGE PERSONAL
SACRIFICE TONIGHT.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.244
OH, MAN.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.478
WHAT?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.280
NOTHING.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.787
UM, I CAN'T
BE DOING THIS.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.555
SHH.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.658
UH, I JUST GOTTA
CHECK ON THE KIDS.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.626
MM. YOU'RE SO DEVOTED.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.929
IT'S REALLY...GRRRR!

19:22.962 --> 19:27.367
IT'S JUST THAT IF
HENRY DOESN'T HEAR THAT
STUPID TUGBOAT STORY,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.502
HE CAN'T GO TO SLEEP.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.505
OH, THAT IS SO HOT.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.943
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET OFF OF ME.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.512
I'M AN UNCLE.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.662
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.563
BOBBY.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.699
PARTY'S MOVIN'
TO BOBBY'S HOUSE, EVERYBODY!

19:59.732 --> 20:01.234
COME ON!

20:03.603 --> 20:06.339
IT WAS WEIRD.
I HAD PANGS.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.741
PANGS OF RESPONSIBILITY.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.777
IT WAS NEW FOR ME.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.612
I HAVEN'T HAD
RESPONSIBILITY PANGS

20:12.645 --> 20:15.982
SINCE I HAD THAT--
WHAT WAS IT?
A CAT OR SOMETHING?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.317
THAT'S GREAT, ED,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE

20:17.350 --> 20:20.553
BECAUSE CLAUDIA AND I
ARE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO LEAVE TOWN AGAIN.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.890
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DID AS GOOD A JOB
AS YOU WOULD'VE DONE.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.993
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
MORE TO PARENTING
THAN JUST PANGS.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.428
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.496
GOOD NIGHT, HENRY.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.798
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND CHECK
YOUR WINDOWS IF YOU WANT.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.065
NO, THAT'S OK.
I'M FINE.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.403
YOU SURE? WHAT ABOUT
THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN?
YOU WON'T BE SCARED?

20:36.436 --> 20:40.740
NAH. UNCLE EDDIE
GAVE ME
A SECRET WEAPON.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.611
OH, JEEZ! WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT!

20:44.644 --> 20:46.979
RELAX, DAD.
IT'S JUST A HEAD.

20:47.013 --> 20:51.284
YEAH, SEE? THAT WAY,
IF THE HORSEMAN COMES,
HE CAN TAKE THAT ONE,

20:51.318 --> 20:54.053
ALL SEVERED
AND READY TO GO.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.054
Sean: OK.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.624
COME ON, DENNIS.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.494
NOW, SEE?
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.562
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.696
I'M A GOOD UNCLE.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.697
YOU'RE ADEQUATE.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.033
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OFF AND SEE
YOUR FRIEND LARA?

21:07.066 --> 21:10.036
YEAH. MAYBE
I'LL BRING HER BY SOMETIME
SO YOU GUYS CAN MEET HER.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.806
JUST REMEMBER, YOU'RE
A DRUNK, AND YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.007
GOT IT.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.611
Claudia: AND YOU'RE A HO!

21:23.850 --> 21:26.653
HEY.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.723
OH. I FEEL GREAT.
THAT STUFF REALLY WORKS.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.562
HOW THE HELL
DID I GET HERE?

21:38.130 --> 21:38.965
"TIPPY THE TUGBOAT
TUGGED THE FREIGHTER.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.833
"TIPPY THE TUGBOAT
TUGGED THE BARGE.

21:40.867 --> 21:41.501
TIPPY THE TUGBOAT--"

21:41.534 --> 21:45.505
OH, WAIT!
DENNIS CAN'T SEE.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.439
THIS IS CREEPY.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.408
YEAH. YOU OWE ME.
KEEP READING,
PARTY BOY.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.709
I ALREADY SAID
I WAS SORRY.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.944
DENNIS IS
GETTING BORED.

21:51.978 --> 21:52.945
SURE, HE IS.

21:52.979 --> 21:53.880
OH, WELL,
"HE TUGGED THEM,
AND HE TUGGED THEM,

21:53.913 --> 21:56.583
AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY
EVER AFTER. THE END."

21:56.616 --> 21:58.518
NOW IT'S TIME
TO GO TO BED, HENRY.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.586
OK. KISSES.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.621
NOT ME. DENNIS.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.656
KISS IT!
