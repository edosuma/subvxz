Roland, are you alright?

00:04.754 --> 00:06.294
WOMAN: <i>Ryan, is everything OK?</i>

00:06.295 --> 00:07.501
What kind of demon is it?

00:07.502 --> 00:10.399
From the signature,
it looks like a restoring demon,

00:11.189 --> 00:14.460
created to restore the natural order
after a magical disturbance.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.722
Destroy the talisman
and go back home.

00:16.723 --> 00:21.220
- The talisman's protecting us, Sam!
- Mia's right! You'll see.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.220
(Thunder cracks)

00:25.714 --> 00:29.134
I need you to find the spell
that Alice cast and reverse it.

00:29.135 --> 00:31.271
If what's attacking us
comes from another world,

00:31.272 --> 00:33.885
then we need to use elements
from another world.

00:33.886 --> 00:36.731
Jake - practical, stubborn, brutish.
Earth.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.766
So, the other boys
are the other elements!

00:38.767 --> 00:42.100
You know how we're here because of a
magical event? Felix IS that event.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.601
SAM: What?

you'll be all very happy about.

you have the flora and fauna logs,

Watch it!

02:04.834 --> 02:08.854
- Mr Bates, I'm heaps freaking out.
- Speak English, please, Ellen.

02:08.913 --> 02:14.199
Well, I heard that a panther escaped
from a circus in that forest.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.765
Ah, that's an old myth, Ellen.
Not too much to worry about.

02:17.903 --> 02:21.144
- What if it eats my face off?
- Let's risk it, shall we?

02:25.516 --> 02:29.811
OK, Year 10s, form groups of four
as I call out your names.

02:30.049 --> 02:33.269
Mia, Trent, Dylan, and Ellen.

02:33.282 --> 02:35.782
- I thought we were together!
- He must have changed it.

02:35.783 --> 02:40.043
Then we have Jake, Sam,
and they are with Andy and Felix.

02:40.092 --> 02:42.581
ANDY: Brains and brawn.
Excellent choice, sir.

02:44.821 --> 02:49.031

JAKE: You used gothed-up magic
to transport us here...?

03:02.145 --> 03:04.875
SAM: And you didn't even tell us.
Unbelievable!

03:04.876 --> 03:07.446
I knew it.
You're a true witch.

03:08.172 --> 03:11.149
I cast a spell
to make Oscar walk again.

03:11.209 --> 03:15.770
- I didn't think it would actually work.
- But you lied to us, all this time!

03:15.771 --> 03:18.810
Because of you, we ate garbage,
we slept in sheds

03:18.811 --> 03:20.231
and our mothers almost died!

03:20.232 --> 03:22.372
And there's a demon
trying to kill us!

03:22.373 --> 03:24.589
We're your so-called friends!

03:24.649 --> 03:27.050
We risked our lives for you!

03:29.327 --> 03:30.867
I'm sorry.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.346
Is that all you can say?!

03:36.019 --> 03:37.879
Just let him cool off.

03:52.737 --> 03:54.517
What spell did you cast?

03:54.518 --> 03:58.191
An unmaking spell
to undo Oscar's accident.

03:58.253 --> 04:01.183
I didn't know that it would unmake
all of us as well.

04:01.184 --> 04:03.308
Well, shouldn't you have
thought of that before?

04:03.309 --> 04:05.896
At least this explains
why the demon targets you.

04:05.897 --> 04:09.720
You're the magical disturbance,
but why us?

04:09.721 --> 04:13.621
Of all the kids at school, why did
you choose Jake, Sam, and me?

04:14.152 --> 04:15.932
Because you have potential.

04:16.488 --> 04:20.269
I knew it!
See? I have potential!

04:20.329 --> 04:22.871
- Potential for what?
- Magic.

04:22.872 --> 04:26.688
Awesome! This is not an indication
of forgiveness, by the way.

04:26.689 --> 04:28.309
No way.

04:30.887 --> 04:32.207
Hi!

04:32.652 --> 04:34.099
Hi.

04:35.052 --> 04:38.309
- Hey, good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.130
Don't go there, remember?

04:40.131 --> 04:43.269
Ellen's come to visit Andy,
and I'm here as moral support.

04:43.270 --> 04:46.603
I'm glad that you're a good friend
and that I get to see you as well.

04:47.369 --> 04:49.109
So, what now?

04:49.169 --> 04:53.074
Now we know how we got here, we should
be able to work out a way home.

04:53.075 --> 04:56.055
I thought I could find the answer
in Alice's Book of Shadows.

04:56.056 --> 04:59.215
An unmaking spell?
That's the spell Alice cast.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.776
Yep, except her spell went even more
wrong, so that's no help.

05:03.026 --> 05:06.069
I'm beginning to understand
why everyone hates you, Felix.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.610
Thanks.

05:09.028 --> 05:10.728
So, what can help us?

05:10.729 --> 05:13.568
- The talisman.
- Except it's broken.

05:13.569 --> 05:16.989
I think the talisman can do more
than just protect us.

05:17.049 --> 05:21.509
- I think we can use it to get home.
- Like I said, if it worked!

05:22.903 --> 05:26.451
We have to reactivate the talisman
by repeating the spell.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.535
It needs the four of us.

05:33.363 --> 05:36.339
- Hi! Ellen!
- Do you want to hang out with us?

05:36.340 --> 05:39.267
There's this new pancake parlour -
triple bacon and maple syrup.

05:39.268 --> 05:41.509
Sorry, but I have a family thing.

05:41.510 --> 05:44.989
There's other equally attractive
and unhealthy menu items.

05:45.049 --> 05:49.789
- Seriously, I can't. Sorry.
- I won't keep trying forever, you know?

05:49.790 --> 05:52.809
I would much, much rather
be having pancakes with you,

05:52.816 --> 05:56.509
but my family needs me!
It's sort of a crisis.

05:56.569 --> 05:59.178
You're too cute.
Gets me every time.

05:59.179 --> 06:02.079
Once we get this done,
I'll come see you, I promise.

06:04.843 --> 06:06.463
Sam, we need you inside.

06:06.523 --> 06:09.743
- Yeah, well, I'm out here, alright?
- It's about getting home.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.767
Look, I gotta go.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.423
Remember how I said
that I needed to be alone?

06:15.587 --> 06:19.773
- Yeah, look, I get it. I'm sorry.
- I don't think I meant it.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.290
Seriously?

06:23.291 --> 06:25.023
We really need to go, Sam!

06:27.951 --> 06:31.308
That was a waste of three hours of
relationship counselling.

06:31.838 --> 06:35.066
RYAN: They destroyed school property -
I suspect not for the first time.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.383
I'll call their guardian
to bring them in.

06:37.443 --> 06:40.223
I thought it was your job
to uphold the law, Gary.

06:40.283 --> 06:44.063
I thought it was yours
to handle teenagers, Brian.

06:44.064 --> 06:46.829
These boys have been trouble
since they first showed up.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.911
Isn't it time you did something
about it, Sergeant?

06:48.912 --> 06:51.666
This isn't the first complaint
we've had, Sarge.

06:55.562 --> 06:59.705
- OK, we'll bring them in, then.
- Right.

07:08.171 --> 07:10.132
I'm the Water element, right?

07:10.133 --> 07:11.333
Mm-hmm.

07:13.727 --> 07:15.267
You're Earth.

07:18.383 --> 07:20.043
Blow, airhead.

07:21.091 --> 07:22.614
(Puffs)

07:22.639 --> 07:24.639
I still hate you.

07:25.065 --> 07:27.671
- I know.
- And Fire.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.331
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee,

07:41.332 --> 07:45.209
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.040
Within this stone,
I invoke Ye place,

07:48.041 --> 07:50.965
Your greatest
strength, your kindest grace,

07:50.966 --> 07:53.266
And while this stone
remains at hand,

07:53.267 --> 07:55.942
Thou shall be safe
throughout this land.

08:01.141 --> 08:02.721
Is it working?

08:02.722 --> 08:05.217
It used to glow
when all of us are around.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.906
Maybe it's broken for good.

08:06.907 --> 08:09.167
A talisman is a vessel
for magical energy.

08:09.168 --> 08:11.724
You should be able to repair it,
theoretically.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.894
Something's missing.

08:14.977 --> 08:17.795
OK, what's different between now

08:17.842 --> 08:20.120
and when you got it
to work the first time?

08:24.474 --> 08:28.346
Divinity of the Elements,
I invoke Thee.

08:35.034 --> 08:37.616
Bees? A bed?

08:37.616 --> 08:39.760
Sam farted.
(Laughs mockingly)

08:39.761 --> 08:41.217
I don't think that's the answer.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.743
Another Element.
The Fifth Element!

08:47.875 --> 08:50.306
- Of course!
- What's the Fifth Element?

08:50.366 --> 08:53.106
According to Pagan Law,
there are four worldly Elements -

08:53.166 --> 08:57.746
Earth, Fire, Air, and Water -
and then a fifth Element, Spirit.

08:57.806 --> 09:00.331
It helps us connect
to our higher power.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.971
- What's he doing here?
- That doesn't matter right now!

09:05.972 --> 09:07.723
So, what does he know?
Do we have to kill him?

09:07.724 --> 09:09.246
I know that
you're aliens!

09:10.288 --> 09:12.347
- My brother.
- What about him?

09:12.348 --> 09:14.034
Oscar is the Fifth Element.

09:14.046 --> 09:16.183
I thought the Elements
had to come from our world.

09:16.184 --> 09:18.800
Oscar is the reason
the spell was cast.

09:18.886 --> 09:22.026
He is the connection between
our world and your world.

09:22.086 --> 09:24.969
Righto, you boys
need to come with me.

09:24.970 --> 09:27.146
- PHOEBE: Why?
- ROBERTS: Because we say so?

09:27.147 --> 09:29.048
Oh, so, we live
in a police state now!

09:29.049 --> 09:31.802
Oh, come on, Phoebe. We've wanted
to talk to these boys for a while.

09:31.803 --> 09:35.605
They vandalised the auto workshop
at school, amongst other things.

09:35.606 --> 09:39.204
What are you doing here?
I'll handle this, thanks, Bates.

09:39.321 --> 09:41.346
Like you've handled everything else.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.496
You can't just take us away
from our legal guardian!

09:43.497 --> 09:44.917
Watch me. Come on, let's go.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.504
How about I send them to bed
without any dinner. Will that do?

09:47.505 --> 09:50.551
- No, it won't do. Come on, boys, move it.
- Yeah, alright, alright!

09:51.111 --> 09:52.453
Let's go.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.926
Let's go, move it.
Come on.

09:56.821 --> 10:00.712
I'm reporting you to Human Services.
Dialling now.

10:00.713 --> 10:03.391
Yeah, well, tell them what a useless
guardian you are while you're at it.

10:03.392 --> 10:06.623
I'll tell them the police are using
unnecessary force on minors.

10:06.665 --> 10:09.305
There are only three seatbelts
in the back there, Constable.

10:09.306 --> 10:11.937
- I'll bring this one.
- We'll squeeze him in.

10:12.486 --> 10:15.146
- Is that legal?
- Not really, Sarge.

10:15.761 --> 10:19.226
You bring him, if you think
you can manage that small task.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.578
Of course!
Come on, Felix.

10:24.464 --> 10:27.285
I'm happy to take him.
It's on my way.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.483
I can do it.

10:30.658 --> 10:32.718
Let go! I said I'll do it!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.546
Something's wrong.

10:36.726 --> 10:38.266
What's happening?

10:42.583 --> 10:44.123
What a psycho!

10:44.284 --> 10:47.430
- Mr Bates flipped out!
- You've only just noticed?

10:49.481 --> 10:51.799
What now?
Demon Bates is mega scary.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.412
Find Oscar and activate the talisman
with his spirit.

10:54.413 --> 10:55.821
Will it work without the others?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.814
I don't know, but you don't have
a choice. Go out... No, no, no!

10:59.646 --> 11:01.631
- What about you?
- He's not after me!

11:01.632 --> 11:04.052
- I'm not gonna leave you alone!
- I'm fine! Go, go!

11:05.248 --> 11:07.930
- Out of my way.
- Oh, my God.

11:09.154 --> 11:10.354
Arggh!

11:22.766 --> 11:24.666
(Growls)

11:35.806 --> 11:39.026
It is fork in the road time, boys.

11:39.027 --> 11:41.683
It's not what you think.
It's a matter of life and death.

11:41.696 --> 11:44.625
Listen to me, either you sit up
and take notice or you end up

11:44.626 --> 11:46.940
doing nothing with your life.
Is that really what you want?

11:46.941 --> 11:48.698
We're not from this world,
Sergeant Riles!

11:48.699 --> 11:49.843
Oh, not this again.

11:49.844 --> 11:52.343
We're from a parallel universe
exactly like this one,

11:52.344 --> 11:54.889
except here we don't exist.

11:54.890 --> 11:56.833
I see you've attracted new members
to your cult.

11:56.834 --> 11:59.021
- It's the truth.
- You don't exist, right?

11:59.022 --> 12:01.221
Yet we can see you
sitting right in front of us.

12:01.222 --> 12:03.688
But you don't know who we are.
No-one does!

12:03.689 --> 12:06.234
Tell me, then.
Who are you?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.683
What are you, nuts, mate?!

12:40.512 --> 12:44.786
My name is Jake Riles.
In our universe, I'm your son.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.829
That's what he said
when he first came in, Sarge.

12:49.332 --> 12:51.552
You are unhinged, kid.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.227
Your ex-girlfriend Sarah,
she's my mum.

12:54.228 --> 12:57.008
Enough. This is clearly
a mental health issue.

12:57.009 --> 13:01.108
In my world, you and Sarah had a kid
when you were teenagers - me!

13:02.019 --> 13:05.970
- Call Child Services again.
- Look at me, Dad! You know me.

13:06.239 --> 13:09.099
I know you feel it!
Just trust your feelings!

13:09.100 --> 13:12.842
Magic brought us here. I know it
sounds mental, but I've seen it.

13:13.068 --> 13:16.826
Bates is possessed by a demon
and he's trying to kill Felix.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.207
Now, that's just silly!

13:18.208 --> 13:21.307
Well, where's Phoebe and Felix?
They're supposed to be here!

13:21.308 --> 13:24.999
Bates was chasing them. I tried to tell
you earlier, but you just made a joke.

13:25.729 --> 13:28.459
- Call Phoebe and ask her where she is.
- Sure, Sarge.

13:28.753 --> 13:32.973
And call Bates,
and tell him to come here right now.

13:34.288 --> 13:37.214
I want you to repeat these
allegations to his face.

13:41.578 --> 13:44.598
(Mobile phone rings)

13:45.713 --> 13:47.360
(Mobile phone beeps)
BATES: Hello?

13:47.631 --> 13:49.651
No, I left them at the shop.

13:51.307 --> 13:53.042
Yes, of
course.

13:53.515 --> 13:55.486
I'll be right
there.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.112
Sorry, Mr Bates.
"You're welcome, Oscar!"

14:38.116 --> 14:41.311
- We're not discussing this anymore.
- Close-minded like closed book.

14:41.312 --> 14:43.392
I've heard that before, Lily,
about a thousand times.

14:43.393 --> 14:44.901
- What are you doing?
- I need you.

14:44.902 --> 14:47.964
I'm on my way to work. My parents
make me earn my Walterian mothership.

14:47.965 --> 14:50.094
Forget that. You have to
help me with a spell.

14:50.095 --> 14:51.867
- Me?
- Yes, you.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.291
Can you see Bates?

14:53.858 --> 14:55.866
With a bit of subtlety...?

14:57.409 --> 14:59.509
Oh, it's too late.
He's coming this way.

14:59.569 --> 15:01.069
Run! Run!

15:05.078 --> 15:08.378
- Oh, Mr Bates, how are you?
- Hiya! Ghost!

15:08.649 --> 15:11.085
- You can do magic!
- Since when?

15:11.086 --> 15:12.746
Because you and I are related!

15:12.747 --> 15:15.164
I knew it! I'm an alien too!
So cool!

15:15.165 --> 15:18.225
- Not so cool and not so loud!
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

15:18.226 --> 15:20.312
It wasn't quite as urgent
as it is right now.

15:20.338 --> 15:22.522
- Urgent?
- Yes. We're under attack.

15:22.523 --> 15:25.752
- Bates is possessed by a demon.
- And he's right behind you.

15:26.706 --> 15:28.486
- That way!
- I wanna stay with you.

15:28.487 --> 15:31.747
No, he's after me!
You go that way. Run, Oscar!

15:32.249 --> 15:34.789
Here, Bates, you freak!

15:46.198 --> 15:48.018
(Growls)

16:13.038 --> 16:14.978
(Glass shatters)

16:22.241 --> 16:24.101
(Metal clangs)

16:56.174 --> 16:57.834
Arggh!

17:10.364 --> 17:13.023
Nothing from Phoebe,
but Bates says he's on his way.

17:13.025 --> 17:15.718
For the record, I'm not buying
your magic story for one second.

17:15.719 --> 17:16.779
It's the
truth!

17:16.780 --> 17:18.599
We're seriously running
out of time, Dad.

17:18.601 --> 17:20.056
Report just in, Sarge.

17:20.057 --> 17:23.676
Bates was seen chasing two teenagers
north along Rowe Street.

17:23.678 --> 17:25.848
- It's Felix!
- Who's the other kid?

17:25.848 --> 17:28.229
- Oscar?
- The Fifth Element.

17:28.289 --> 17:29.789
Let's go.

17:30.185 --> 17:32.125
Take us with you!

17:33.019 --> 17:35.149
Sorry, mate,
this is a police matter.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.938
It's just across the road, Dad, and
we're just gonna follow you anyway.

17:37.939 --> 17:41.511
- Stop calling me 'Dad'.
- I will if you let us come.

17:43.372 --> 17:45.072
Come on, let's go.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.979
Stay out of sight
and don't do anything.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.476
What are you doing?
I told you to run!

17:51.477 --> 17:54.057
- You said you needed my help!
- Yes, but not now!

17:54.087 --> 17:56.120
You're sending me
mixed messages.

17:56.338 --> 17:58.321
Demon chase.
So cool!

17:58.322 --> 18:02.262
Not cool, Oscar - lethal!
This is not a game!

18:02.569 --> 18:04.304
Gotta find the others!

18:05.242 --> 18:07.574
Police station.
Bates can't kill us there.

18:07.609 --> 18:09.709
- Kill us?!
- Yes, <i>kill us!</i>

18:14.062 --> 18:16.805
They've gone.
Come on.

18:18.573 --> 18:20.353
Let's get back to Phoebe's.

18:20.569 --> 18:22.066
Arggh!

18:22.067 --> 18:24.648
- Felix! Get off me! Let me go!
- Don't hurt him!

18:24.649 --> 18:27.648
You know the price.
Come with me, Felix.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.866
Let him go first.

18:33.131 --> 18:34.498
Run!

18:35.529 --> 18:37.806
(Growls)

18:37.807 --> 18:40.107
Are you sure it was Brian Bates,
the schoolteacher?

18:40.108 --> 18:42.503
- Yeah, the science teacher.
- Chasing two boys!

18:42.504 --> 18:44.412
- See?
- Ignore him.

18:44.413 --> 18:47.109
- Which way did they go?
- That way.

18:47.542 --> 18:50.542
- We'll be faster if we drive.
- Let's go, team!

18:50.543 --> 18:53.883
- This is where we part company.
- I thought we were a team!

18:53.884 --> 18:56.254
This is not a team!
We're police officers. We're a team.

18:56.255 --> 18:59.288
You're just...
Very strange boys.

18:59.365 --> 19:02.622
- Good luck, then, Dad.
- Thanks, Son. I mean, Jake!

19:03.548 --> 19:05.735
You head back
to the police station...

19:05.736 --> 19:07.587
Where to now?

19:08.689 --> 19:11.180
Phoebe's, yeah?

19:14.039 --> 19:16.800
- Did we lose him?
- I think so.

19:17.754 --> 19:19.294
What's happening?

19:19.295 --> 19:21.408
I need your spirit to make
this talisman work.

19:21.409 --> 19:23.029
But why me?

19:23.333 --> 19:26.052
Because in another world,
you're my brother.

19:27.313 --> 19:28.525
Whoa!

19:29.343 --> 19:31.075
I've always wanted a brother.

19:31.439 --> 19:33.306
Hold this.

19:34.127 --> 19:36.593
OK. Close your eyes.

19:37.734 --> 19:40.348
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee,

19:40.349 --> 19:42.908
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

19:43.095 --> 19:46.079
Within this store I invoke Ye place...
(Car horn honks)

19:46.080 --> 19:48.017
Your greatest strength,
your kindest grace,

19:48.018 --> 19:49.638
And while this stone remains at hand,

19:49.639 --> 19:51.673
Thou shall be safe
throughout this land.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.551
He's back! Run!

20:01.877 --> 20:03.894
- Curious?
- Very.

20:11.157 --> 20:13.222
Leave him!
Just take me.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.871
I'll take you both.

20:18.119 --> 20:19.319
Arggh!

20:19.320 --> 20:21.147
No! Oscar!

20:23.117 --> 20:25.297
BOTH: Order must be restored.

20:26.997 --> 20:28.933
Arggh! Get off!

20:34.717 --> 20:38.346
- What happened?
- We had a visit from a demon, what else?

20:38.347 --> 20:40.567
- That's pretty much what we figured.
- Are you alright?

20:40.568 --> 20:44.236
- I think so. What's happened to Felix?
- Bates is chasing him and Oscar.

20:44.237 --> 20:46.732
- My dad's after them, though.
- Well, he doesn't stand a chance.

20:46.733 --> 20:49.734
Bates picked me up
and threw me like a ragdoll.

20:50.007 --> 20:53.120
- We've gotta find them.
- Right. Let's go.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.781
And then what?

20:56.597 --> 20:59.131
- Strong language?
- Mediation?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.482
Brute force is the only way
to deal with a demon.

21:01.483 --> 21:04.299
Honestly,
what planet are you boys from?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.962
- Good question.
- It was rhetorical.

21:06.963 --> 21:10.717
- Whatever. We need to defeat him.
- Somehow.

21:10.718 --> 21:13.458
- There's only one way, isn't there?
- Yes.

21:14.951 --> 21:16.590
Magic.

21:21.563 --> 21:24.607
- Hey!
- FELIX: Help! Help me!

21:24.652 --> 21:27.099
That's my freak
of a next-door neighbour!

21:27.220 --> 21:30.132
You're crossing professional
boundaries, Mr Bates!

21:32.050 --> 21:33.630
We're reporting you!

22:15.889 --> 22:18.543
Here we go again,
saving Felix from the demon.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.583
Hey, Felix used magic to help
his brother. You'd do the same.

22:21.584 --> 22:24.004
- Yeah, I guess.
- And the boy has skill.

22:24.005 --> 22:27.389
And we have potential.
Does that make us warlocks as well?

22:27.548 --> 22:29.760
It just seems
to make you a pain.

22:31.505 --> 22:34.565
- The craziest thing happened!
- We thought we'd better tell you.

22:34.566 --> 22:36.586
Felix just got kidnapped
by a teacher.

22:36.587 --> 22:38.965
- Mr Bates, right?
- How did you know?

22:38.966 --> 22:42.666
- And Ellen's next-door neighbour.
- Oscar was helping Bates?

22:42.667 --> 22:44.607
They were carrying Felix together.

22:44.615 --> 22:47.106
The demon's learned to possess
more than one body.

22:47.107 --> 22:52.037
- OK, now I'm really scared.
- Demon? As in the football team?

22:52.046 --> 22:55.026
No, as in evil supernatural force.

22:55.027 --> 22:56.728
We need to go to the police.

22:56.729 --> 23:01.192
Hold on one sec, did you just say
'evil supernatural force'?

23:03.096 --> 23:05.261
It's probably confession time, guys.

23:10.132 --> 23:12.633
It all started
with the school excursion.

23:15.449 --> 23:19.309
FELIX: Help! Help!
Oh! Help!

23:19.310 --> 23:21.063
OSCAR: Quiet, flesh!

23:26.224 --> 23:28.724
(Rock music blares on radio)

23:36.980 --> 23:40.079
Let me out!
Let me out of here!

23:40.086 --> 23:42.586
(Siren wails)
Let me out! Oscar!

23:42.920 --> 23:45.180
Look at me!
Oscar!

23:47.689 --> 23:49.829
- Pursuit?
- Pursuit.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.290
Let me out!

24:00.126 --> 24:02.590
Right, so, where is Bates
taking Felix?

24:02.591 --> 24:05.020
The forest! That's where
the wormhole appeared.

24:05.021 --> 24:06.841
And that's where Alice
cast her spell.

24:07.523 --> 24:09.463
Pull over to the side of the road!

24:10.427 --> 24:14.597
So, if the demon kills Felix,
then the magic spell dies with him?

24:14.598 --> 24:16.351
Does that mean
we get to go home?

24:16.352 --> 24:18.706
- Roland!
- That place in the forest,

24:18.707 --> 24:21.469
this isn't the first time something
like this has happened there.

24:21.470 --> 24:24.530
If I can make this work,
I think I can get us home.

24:25.574 --> 24:27.834
- Why didn't you stop?
- FELIX: Help!

24:27.835 --> 24:29.896
All right, out of the car!
Move it!

24:29.897 --> 24:32.117
What are we actually gonna do
in the forest?

24:32.118 --> 24:33.648
BOTH: That way!

24:33.831 --> 24:35.341
Alice was here.

24:35.530 --> 24:37.790
Stay there!
Don't make me draw my weapon!

24:37.866 --> 24:40.766
We've seen signs like this before.
It's starting.
