WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.237
I took the job.
And right to the point.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.206
I told them I couldn't start
till the first of the year,

00:05.239 --> 00:07.608
thinking I could spend that
time here, see if it works.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.510
And if it doesn't,
you take the job in Dallas.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.245
ANNABETH:
 Ruby doesn't get
 to swoop in and take him.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.580
We were in love once.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.615
And Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.216
Just so everything's out
on the table, I called Tansy.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.119
I don't see her
as a placeholder.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.687
If that's how you think
Zoe sees you,

00:19.720 --> 00:20.588
then you should
talk to her.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.124
Hey, I was actually
hoping we could talk.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.692
Talk? We don't talk.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.495
Are you gonna come over later?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.563
I-I... (clears throat)
I don't think so.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.380
Hey, stranger.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.282
Noticed you didn't

00:48.316 --> 00:50.184
come by last night.
Yeah, I've been,

00:50.218 --> 00:53.087
uh, working pretty late.
Wow.

00:53.121 --> 00:56.157
You've been pulling double
shifts, like, all week.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.758
Saving up to buy a two-wheeler?

00:57.791 --> 01:00.828
Been short-staffed
at the Rammer Jammer.
Yeah?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.830
At the office, too.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.697
We still haven't hired
a receptionist.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.301
And worse, Brick is
making the coffee,

01:07.335 --> 01:08.669
and refuses
to read the directions,

01:08.702 --> 01:11.139
so he's probably making
more patients sick

01:11.172 --> 01:12.773
than came in sick.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.243
Okay.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.178
So... later?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.547
Yeah, I don't know.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.849
Double shift, right.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.753
I'll see you.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.225
(hammer banging)

01:34.728 --> 01:37.665
Wanda, the election's
far from over.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.868
I mean, can't you just
take those posters down?
I was

01:40.901 --> 01:43.171
going to, but now that
they're a real-life couple,

01:43.204 --> 01:44.572
doesn't it just make you smile?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.474
I like to imagine
them talking up there.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.742
(deep voice):
"Hey, Ruby."

01:48.776 --> 01:49.910
(higher voice):
"Morning, Lavon."

01:49.943 --> 01:51.212
(deep voice):
"How'd you sleep?"

01:52.646 --> 01:53.781
Is that weird?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.616
Not at all.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.684
(giggles)

01:56.717 --> 01:58.886
(sighs)
DASH:
Lemon Breeland.

01:58.919 --> 02:03.491
(laughs)
Darling, I, um... I have here

02:03.524 --> 02:05.493
a list of all the bachelors

02:05.526 --> 02:06.860
who are entering picnic baskets

02:06.894 --> 02:09.430
in tomorrow's charity
bachelor blind auction.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.632
You know, for the
Shakespeare Society?
Mm-hmm.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.634
And, well, I noticed
that your father isn't on it.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.337
Oh, Dash, you know
Daddy never enters that.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.705
Well, I do.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.473
But, you see, this year's

02:19.507 --> 02:22.310
production of Twelfth Night
 hangs in the balance.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.644
I know, he's just, you know,

02:23.677 --> 02:25.479
getting over his break-up
with Emily.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.749
Still? Good lord, it's not
like she's Chita Rivera.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.717
Listen, Dash,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.453
we all heal from heartbreak
in our own way.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.755
And maybe us Breelands just...

02:34.788 --> 02:37.691
take more time.
Look, Lemon,

02:37.725 --> 02:40.794
your father means a great deal
of cash to me,

02:40.828 --> 02:43.297
so he might as well just push
aside this heartbreak

02:43.331 --> 02:45.433
and jump back into the game.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.502
Because frankly,
I refuse to do

02:48.536 --> 02:51.171
Twelfth Night
again in choir robes.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.447
Hey, you got a few?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.814
Aah, aah, aah!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.650
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I should've knocked.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.818
No, that's okay,
I use coffee

03:04.852 --> 03:07.421
to wake up, and
now I'm up, so...

03:07.455 --> 03:09.523
No, um, I was wondering if...
Did you get
my message?

03:09.557 --> 03:10.558
I called...
Oh,

03:10.591 --> 03:11.892
I'm sorry I didn't call back.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.395
I didn't realize
you were...
Um...

03:14.428 --> 03:15.296
Ladies first.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.831
Oh, okay, um...
Please.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.334
Okay.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.636
How do I get custody
of Dolly Parton?

03:22.670 --> 03:26.574
Uh... well...
(laughs)

03:26.607 --> 03:27.775
first off, as an officer

03:27.808 --> 03:30.578
of the court, I feel like
I should stop you...
Oh, uh,

03:30.611 --> 03:31.945
Dolly Parton was my dog.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.247
I should have said that.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.648
(laughing):
Yeah.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.849
Yeah, probably.
Well,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.851
my ex-boyfriend Colt-- you
remember, he tried to shoot you

03:37.885 --> 03:39.920
with a crossbow and then
you shot yourself in the leg?

03:39.953 --> 03:41.889
Yeah, the safety...
the safety was off,

03:41.922 --> 03:44.658
but yes, I do remember Colt.
Well, we had

03:44.692 --> 03:49.563
this dog, Dolly Parton,
that I love with all my heart.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.499
And Colt got Dolly Parton

03:51.532 --> 03:52.966
in the breakup because I went
to live with Mama,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.503
who claims she's
allergic to dogs.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.670
And Colt went to work
on the oil rig,

03:56.704 --> 03:58.872
and now his evil
ex-girlfriend, Evelyn,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.409
has Dolly Parton, and
Dolly Parton hates Evelyn

04:01.442 --> 04:03.744
because she makes her wear this
stupid tutu and never takes her

04:03.777 --> 04:05.513
to the dog beach,
and I saw them yesterday

04:05.546 --> 04:07.481
and Dolly Parton is fat,
and I want to know

04:07.515 --> 04:08.849
how to get her back.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.820
Okay, now I'm done.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.288
(laughs)

04:14.322 --> 04:15.489
Well,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.024
I would love to help you,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.993
and I will do some looking
for you, but without

04:20.027 --> 04:20.894
any type of legal agreement,

04:20.928 --> 04:22.863
it might be a little
bit of a long shot.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.565
I just wanted to tell
you that, I mean,

04:24.598 --> 04:26.033
it might be one
of those cases where

04:26.066 --> 04:28.302
possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.571
What's the other tenth--
lawyer's cut?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.041
I'm sorry--
that was rude, and

04:34.074 --> 04:37.378
here you are, nice enough
to give me a free consultation.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.746
Right?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.514
Yeah, for you, any time.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.450
(laughing): Okay.
But, by the way,

04:42.483 --> 04:43.851
uh, since you're here,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.787
and I've been so unhelpful
with your predicament,

04:46.820 --> 04:50.824
I was hoping that you might be
able to help me out with mine.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.693
Well, sure, what is it?
Well,

04:52.726 --> 04:54.662
Dash made me promise
to enter a basket

04:54.695 --> 04:57.365
in tomorrow's bachelor
auction, but to be

04:57.398 --> 04:59.567
honest with you, there is...

04:59.600 --> 05:03.904
only one girl that I want
to have a date with.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.840
And... you want to know

05:06.874 --> 05:08.442
what to put in the basket
so this girl

05:08.476 --> 05:09.810
will bid on you-- I get it.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.512
Okay, um, what
do you have so far?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.414
Actually, Tansy, I...
Wait, um, no, no, no.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.949
Don't tell me, let me guess.
Um... (clears throat)

05:15.983 --> 05:17.918
...takeout lunch for two
from Fancie's:

05:17.951 --> 05:19.753
glazed chicken,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.555
potato salad,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.023
two slices of maple pie,

05:23.056 --> 05:26.760
and... linen napkins.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.430
Mm, nah...

05:29.463 --> 05:30.698
Okay, yeah, how'd you know?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.700
Well, it doesn't
take a psychic.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.602
You're, you know,
kind of predictable.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.572
Oh, in a good way.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.108
You're just so...
George Tucker, you know?

05:41.141 --> 05:45.112
And the kind of girl you like
is gonna love your basket.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.647
Maybe just toss in
some cupcakes,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.582
spice it up-- good luck.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.454
And thank you.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.860
RUBY:
And look at the view-- you can
see all of downtown Dallas.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.130
Oh, and the building has
a full gym, a swimming pool

06:03.163 --> 06:05.966
and a spa.
(giggles)

06:05.999 --> 06:09.102
Oh, I can't wait for you to come
see it, you're gonna love it.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.908
You know what?
(clears throat)

06:14.942 --> 06:16.076
Enough apartment talk.

06:16.109 --> 06:20.581
Tomorrow is the bachelor
auction, and I plan to win you,

06:20.614 --> 06:21.882
Mr. Mayor, as my date.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.484
So, come on, spill it.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.652
What's in the basket?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.487
I can't tell you that.
(groans)

06:26.520 --> 06:29.623
Fine, if you want to be a
Goody Two-Shoes about it.
Ah-ah-ah.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.159
I can't tell you what's
in my basket.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.162
But I can tell you
I left it open...
Oh.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.164
in the study.
Ooh.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.568
In case I just happen to
wander in and take a peek?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.503
Which I will, because

06:42.536 --> 06:46.907
I plan to spend every second
I have left here with you.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.442
Hmm.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.443
(door opens)

06:49.477 --> 06:50.410
Okay,

06:50.444 --> 06:53.681
day six of Wade avoiding
sex with me-- discuss.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.651
Whoa, whoa!

06:57.685 --> 07:00.488
Look how late I am
for something.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.055
Hey, maybe you two

07:02.089 --> 07:04.458
can talk about it, huh?
RUBY: Oh.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.893
Seeing as you both are here.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.229
Good at girl talk.
(laughs)

07:09.262 --> 07:11.532
Okay, look, I know you've had
your differences,

07:11.565 --> 07:14.668
but please
talk to her.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.237
Because if Zoe Hart is left
alone in her own head,

07:17.270 --> 07:20.207
Lord knows what
calamities might ensue.

07:20.240 --> 07:20.974
Hey!

07:22.242 --> 07:23.477
Yeah, okay.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.182
(laughs)

07:29.216 --> 07:29.983
(quiet laugh)

07:33.987 --> 07:35.823
Okay, I give in.
So, this is just

07:35.856 --> 07:37.791
too juicy to not discuss.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.227
Yep.
Okay, so Wade turning
down sex? I mean,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.495
you check his pulse?

07:41.529 --> 07:42.295
I know, right?

07:42.329 --> 07:44.097
He has an all-access
pass to ZoeLand.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.699
He doesn't have
to wait in any lines.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.968
And then all of
a sudden, he just...

07:49.803 --> 07:50.771
What?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.105
Oh, my God.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
Wade is bored.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.743
No! What, Wade?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.978
Bored of ZoeLand? No.
Yeah, it...

07:58.011 --> 07:59.012
it's true.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.814
He's already seen
my light parade.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.083
Spun my teacups,
ridden my Space Mountain.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.553
Now he's on to
the next amusement park.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.220
I'm sorry.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.591
It's okay. You know,
it was bound to happen.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.892
Yeah.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.995
Wait, you know what?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.097
If it helps, you...

08:17.130 --> 08:19.299
you always have a
front-of-the-line pass

08:19.332 --> 08:22.035
for ice cream, with me.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.605
Thanks, Ruby.
I appreciate that.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.740
Okay.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.276
Bye.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.711
(sighs)

08:36.249 --> 08:37.885
Curling?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.285
Seriously?

08:39.318 --> 08:41.855
Anything played at
a professional level

08:41.889 --> 08:43.724
can be compelling.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.259
Okay, Daddy, I know that you
are still hurting over Emily,

08:46.293 --> 08:47.828
but watching
a bunch of Canadians

08:47.861 --> 08:49.597
chase after
a weird thingy over ice

08:49.630 --> 08:51.732
with a bunch of brooms
is not the answer.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.901
That weird "thingy"
is called a stone...

08:53.934 --> 08:55.168
I don't care.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.071
Listen, what I meant was,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.140
is that sometimes
in order to heal

09:00.173 --> 09:02.676
you have to just
get back out there

09:02.710 --> 09:04.311
and push that
old heartbreak aside.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.946
Yeah, like a curling stone.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.648
Okay, you need
to turn that thing off.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.582
Right now.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.919
Sweetie...

09:11.952 --> 09:14.922
Daddy, we are Breelands, okay?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.790
And Breelands
do not give up.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.059
Which means you,
Brick Breeland,

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
hottest commodity
in the over-40 category,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.631
are going to enter
a basket

09:23.664 --> 09:25.332
in tomorrow's
bachelor auction.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.700
And I...

09:26.734 --> 09:28.969
am going to bid on one.
(laughs)

09:29.002 --> 09:30.638
Do we have a deal?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.342
Mwah!

09:35.375 --> 09:37.110
*

09:39.246 --> 09:41.815
Hey-o, anyone home?
W...

09:41.849 --> 09:43.784
Wow, I was just coming
over to talk to you.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.719
Well, I-I saved you
the commute. (laughs)

09:45.753 --> 09:48.088
'Cause the thing is, uh...

09:48.121 --> 09:51.892
well... you know that
expression, "Evolve or die"?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.827
Okay, look, I know what
you're going to say...

09:53.861 --> 09:54.928
I-I know
I've been acting

09:54.962 --> 09:56.329
kind of weird recently,
all right?

09:56.363 --> 09:59.032
And-and I've been...
I've been thinking a lot...

09:59.066 --> 10:01.234
Look, I appreciate you trying
to spell it out for me...

10:01.268 --> 10:03.036
I think we should
go on a real date.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.905
A real huh?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.240
I-I know there's a whole, like,
Olympic gymnastics routine

10:07.274 --> 10:08.441
going in your head right now,

10:08.475 --> 10:10.911
and you're thinking
you should probably
consult with Lavon

10:10.944 --> 10:12.880
and half the town
of BlueBell and...

10:12.913 --> 10:15.215
I don't know,
the pope or whatever...

10:15.248 --> 10:17.250
Jews don't really have a pope.
Just don't talk.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.819
Point is,

10:18.852 --> 10:21.755
if you want to go
on a date with me, just...

10:21.789 --> 10:23.824
bid on my basket
at the auction tomorrow.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.660
I figure it's a perfect way
to go on a first date,

10:26.694 --> 10:28.228
pressure-free.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.398
You can just look at it
as an opportunity to, uh...

10:31.431 --> 10:32.800
test-drive.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.002
You know, kick the tires,
rev the engine,

10:35.035 --> 10:37.004
take 'er for a spin.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.305
Yeah.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.010
Come to the auction
tomorrow, Doc.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.712
*

10:51.218 --> 10:53.754
(car horn honks)

10:53.787 --> 10:55.889
(seagulls calling)

10:55.923 --> 10:57.925
(birds singing)

11:08.068 --> 11:09.970
(clears throat)
Hey, Wade.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.439
Hey, man,
you got a second?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.374
Tucker, haven't seen you
in a while.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.309
How goes things with Tansy?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.246
Well, actually, about that,

11:19.279 --> 11:21.181
I don't know.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.916
But I'm hoping

11:22.950 --> 11:24.351
that she'll bid
on my basket today.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.987
So I was hoping
that you might be able to, uh,

11:27.020 --> 11:28.488
I don't know, kind of tell me

11:28.521 --> 11:30.290
the kind of things
that she likes?

11:30.323 --> 11:32.492
Well, I can, but, uh,

11:32.525 --> 11:35.462
I don't think
they're very "George Tucker."

11:35.495 --> 11:39.900
Okay, how about we just pretend
it's opposite day?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.468
All right.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.305
Wait, does that mean
it's not opposite day?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.506
Just start talking.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.842
Things were going so well.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.410
If it isn't broken, why fix it?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.379
So it's not broken?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.181
Oh, no, it is.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.517
So you're gonna fix it.
Apparently, I have to.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.319
"Evolve or die."

11:59.352 --> 12:00.487
Says who?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.389
Crocodiles have evolved
hardly at all,

12:02.422 --> 12:04.291
and crocodiles are awesome.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.761
Why can't some things
just stay the same?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.963
'Cause I don't want
this wart anymore.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.232
Brick?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.067
Hypothetically speaking,

12:14.101 --> 12:16.369
if two people are
completely different

12:16.403 --> 12:17.838
and never do
anything but fight,

12:17.871 --> 12:20.473
is there possible chance
at a romantic future?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.844
Dr. Hart, are you asking me out?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.913
No.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.849
(bell dinging)

12:28.882 --> 12:30.851
DASH:
 Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.352
the auction is about to begin.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.521
Will all the bachelors
please report

12:34.554 --> 12:36.189
to the bachelor corral?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.925
Sweetie pie, I don't
know about this.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.993
I don't like the idea of
being bid on like cattle.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.261
Oh, come on.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.295
It'll be fun,

12:42.329 --> 12:44.932
and we are opening ourselves up
to opportunities.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.433
Remember?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.003
Moo.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.039
(laughs)

12:52.072 --> 12:53.473
Lemon.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.042
Walt.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.844
What a surprise.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.112
I heard about the fund-raiser,
thought I'd do my part.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.447
Oh, you want to help the arts?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.215
No, I want to help me.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.018
Listen, that night
we met in Mobile,

13:05.052 --> 13:07.187
I know the timing
might not have been right,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.289
but everything else was...

13:11.291 --> 13:14.527
Anyway, I just thought this
might be a chance to try again.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.229
You planning to bid

13:16.263 --> 13:17.564
on a basket?

13:17.597 --> 13:20.567
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.569
Well, I don't want
to ruin the fun,

13:22.602 --> 13:25.138
but if you like
hazelnut truffles,

13:25.172 --> 13:28.008
you can bid on mine.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.243
Or if you like orthodontists.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.212
Either or.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.553
Oh, Tansy.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.355
Tansy, hey.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.057
I just wanted
to let you know that, uh,

13:44.091 --> 13:46.493
George Tucker is not
who you think he is.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.205
Hey, Lavon,
you seen Zoe around?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.907
No.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.474
No, she called me
a few times today,

14:01.508 --> 14:02.642
but I ain't spoken to her.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.444
You need something?

14:04.477 --> 14:06.546
No, no. I'm good.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.481
(gavel bangs)

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
Ladies, it is now time
to open up

14:10.951 --> 14:13.486
your hearts and
your pocketbooks

14:13.520 --> 14:15.322
as we begin the bidding
with picnic basket

14:15.355 --> 14:17.157
number one.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.225
That one's mine.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.927
Now, a date

14:19.960 --> 14:21.228
with this charming BlueBell beau

14:21.261 --> 14:24.464
comes with two homemade
bologna sandwiches.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.333
Ten dollars right here.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.369
Anyone want to bid against me,
bring it on.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.471
I will kick your ass.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.173
And sold

14:33.206 --> 14:34.641
to Miss Wanda Lewis.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.043
(screams)

14:38.411 --> 14:40.247
Okay.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.183
Next is picnic basket
number two.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.584
Now, a date with
this bachelor

14:44.617 --> 14:46.486
boasts a delectable lunch

14:46.519 --> 14:48.989
of homemade crab cakes,
fresh corn salad,

14:49.022 --> 14:51.258
and cherry crumble pie.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.260
Ten dollars.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.195
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.130
A very enthusiastic
ten dollars.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.631
Do I hear $15?

14:58.665 --> 15:01.134
George, isn't that that
girl that you dated

15:01.168 --> 15:02.535
after you broke
up with Lemon?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.104
Yep.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.272
If you like shopping,
you're in luck.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.273
Going twice.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.541
Sold for $30.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.277
A date with BlueBell's
very own...

15:10.310 --> 15:13.013
Dr. Brick Breeland.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.315
All right, ladies,

15:15.348 --> 15:16.716
give it up
for basket number three.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.518
This bachelor seems to have...

15:18.551 --> 15:20.087
Ruby!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.255
Ruby, I've been trying
to reach you all day.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.323
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.292
I've been in escrow hell
on my apartment in Dallas.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.426
What's wrong?
It turns out

15:26.459 --> 15:28.595
that Wade isn't bored
with ZoeLand.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.430
He wants to go on a date.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.032
That's good news, right?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.967
No. He wants to go on a date,

15:34.001 --> 15:36.203
which means he wants
a real relationship, you know?

15:36.236 --> 15:39.706
He asked me to bid on his basket
and I'm freaking out.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.441
Okay, listen, Zoe, this is
the natural progression

15:41.474 --> 15:42.442
of relationships.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.576
They move forward.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.978
Yes, I evolve.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
And he wants to evolve

15:46.313 --> 15:47.981
with you; it's nice.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.683
No, because we cannot
evolve normally.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.352
We're like those freaky

15:52.385 --> 15:54.988
six-legged frogs that they find
in polluted waters.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.123
Why?

15:56.156 --> 15:58.558
Because what would a date
between us even look like?

15:58.591 --> 15:59.759
What would we talk about?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.228
I mean,
look at his stupid basket.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.762
What kind of guy tries
to woo a woman

16:02.795 --> 16:04.631
with a beer crate?
Oh, no, no, no.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.766
Lavon's basket.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.768
I forgot to look
and see what's in it.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.703
Stupid Wade ruins everything.
You know, no.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.638
We're done with you, okay?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.073
Right now you need to find out

16:13.106 --> 16:14.507
which basket is Lavon's,
come on.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.745
Now, this bachelor would love
to wine and dine you

16:18.778 --> 16:20.647
with taquitos

16:20.680 --> 16:23.483
from Jimmy Rae's
Mexican Stand in Mobile,

16:23.516 --> 16:26.253
cherry strudel, and a...

16:26.286 --> 16:29.622
and a blow dryer.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.425
Why would you need a
blow dryer on a picnic?

16:32.459 --> 16:33.560
Wait, do I need a blow dryer?

16:33.593 --> 16:37.464
What kind of man would put
Mexican food with strudel?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.432
I don't know,

16:39.466 --> 16:40.633
but I intend to find out.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.069
Ten dollars!

16:42.102 --> 16:43.236
I hear ten dollars.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.771
Do I hear $15?

16:44.804 --> 16:45.772
$15.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.107
$15.

16:47.140 --> 16:47.774
$30.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.442
$30, a woman who knows

16:49.476 --> 16:51.044
exactly what she wants.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.712
$30, going once,

16:52.745 --> 16:54.181
going twice,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.548
sold to Miss Tansy Truitt.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.586
For $30,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.688
a date with Mr. George Tucker.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.263
Thank you, Lemon.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.799
I just won a date with a girl
who can't wait

17:12.832 --> 17:14.834
to show me the app she uses
to organize her closet.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.435
I'm sorry, Daddy,

17:16.469 --> 17:18.105
but just try and
think of her as practice

17:18.137 --> 17:20.272
for a future actual date,
and then... and remember

17:20.307 --> 17:21.508
to use really small words.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.810
See, these are all
my strappy sandals,

17:24.844 --> 17:26.313
and these are my boots.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.182
Oh.
Come on, I'll help you

17:29.216 --> 17:30.750
download one of these puppies
for yourself.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.818
Oh.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.520
Goody goody.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.124
And without further ado,
on to picnic basket

17:37.157 --> 17:38.258
number five,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.660
with a bottle of Merlot,

17:40.693 --> 17:42.162
a pasta salad,

17:42.195 --> 17:44.231
and hazelnut truffles.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.698
Ten dollars.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.633
I have ten dollars.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.268
Do I hear $15?

17:48.301 --> 17:51.171
I had hazelnut truffles
in my basket, too.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.572
Whose basket is that?

17:52.605 --> 17:53.706
Mine.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.143
Where's Ruby?

17:56.176 --> 17:59.179
Okay, he knows I love
hazelnut truffles.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.148
Ooh, look, this must be
the basket.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.715
Look.
Okay, what if someone else

18:02.749 --> 18:03.816
has hazelnut truffles
in their basket?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.552
You know, they were a special
at the bakery, so...

18:05.585 --> 18:07.220
I know this
is gonna be the one, okay?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.522
I'm just, I'm going with it,
all right?

18:09.556 --> 18:10.723
WOMAN:
$30!

18:10.757 --> 18:12.159
DASH:
Do I hear $35?

18:12.192 --> 18:13.293
$35?

18:13.326 --> 18:14.461
$35, $35.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.462
$35.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.629
$35.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.631
Going once.

18:18.665 --> 18:19.899
$35, going twice.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.903
Sold to the lovely
Miss Lemon Breeland,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.473
a picnic date with, uh...

18:26.506 --> 18:28.541
oh, Mayor Lavon Hayes.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.245
Oh, crap.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.313
Lemon?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.348
Lavon?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.684
What just happened?

18:37.717 --> 18:39.352
DASH:
All right.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.887
All right.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.655
Another happy couple.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.693
Now, moving on to basket
number six.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.829
And a very creative fella,

18:49.862 --> 18:51.364
as we can see.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.466
That's Wade's basket.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.801
I got to give Wade credit

18:54.834 --> 18:56.636
for upgrading
from a burlap sack.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.704
Ten dollars!

18:57.737 --> 18:58.738
DASH:
Ten dollars

18:58.771 --> 19:00.173
for the lovely
Miss Carrie Swain.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.474
Do I hear...

19:01.508 --> 19:05.178
$15! Sorry, but George Tucker
ended up out of my price range.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.180
Well, then,
may the best woman win.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.281
20 bucks!

19:08.315 --> 19:09.649
Ruby, I don't know what to do.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.518
Look, I got my own
mess to clean up, okay?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.820
But the way I see it,
you only have two options.

19:13.853 --> 19:14.754
You're right. What are they?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.389
Bid on Wade's basket
and keep seeing him,

19:16.423 --> 19:18.358
or don't bid
and you two are through.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.426
$25.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.593
$25.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.695
Magnolia Breeland,

19:22.729 --> 19:24.331
as if I don't have
my own problems.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.932
Daddy strictly forbade you
from bidding on a date.

19:25.965 --> 19:26.966
You are too young.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.401
$30!

19:28.435 --> 19:29.436
DASH:
$30.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.603
$35.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.572
I gave you that money
to buy school shoes,

19:32.605 --> 19:33.806
not to buy Wade Kinsella.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.308
$35 going once.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.810
Evolve or die.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
$35 going twice.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.947
And Wade Kinsella's bas...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.549
$40!
...is sold

19:42.582 --> 19:44.284
to Miss Magnolia Breeland.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.185
(applause)

19:48.721 --> 19:50.657
(sighs)

19:59.399 --> 20:01.834
Wade, I am so sorry.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.403
I was just about to bid

20:03.436 --> 20:05.405
on your basket, I swear.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.906
You know what, when
I asked you out,

20:06.939 --> 20:09.276
I pictured several
outcomes, none of which

20:09.309 --> 20:11.611
was my going out on a date
with Magnolia Breeland.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.612
I know, look,

20:12.645 --> 20:15.248
how about we go on a date
after your picnic?

20:15.282 --> 20:17.517
I mean, Magnolia must have
a curfew, right?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.885
I'm busy later, all right?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.687
All right, you know what,
forget Magnolia.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.323
This picnic is the date
that you asked me on,

20:23.356 --> 20:24.991
and it's the one we're going on.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.559
So just wait.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.761
(sighs)

20:30.430 --> 20:33.700
George Tucker, you stacked
your basket so I'd bid on it.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.402
Yeah, I rigged the game.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.969
I throw myself on the mercy
of the court.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.838
So yesterday,

20:38.871 --> 20:42.309
the girl you wanted
a date with was me?

20:42.342 --> 20:45.011
Guess George Tucker's not as
predictable as you thought, huh?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.614
(giggles)

20:47.647 --> 20:50.283
I don't know
what happened.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.618
I'm so sorry.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.053
How could you forget to look
at my basket at home?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.589
I've just been so distracted
with this whole escrow thing.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.525
The Dallas apartment?

20:58.558 --> 20:59.592
Yeah, I should have known.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.860
Lemon's a good sport.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.564
Well, she's not, but I'm sure
if you explain what happened,

21:04.597 --> 21:07.467
she'll step aside
and let us go out on our date.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.801
No, it's against the rules.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.439
As mayor, I have to set
a good example and all,

21:12.472 --> 21:13.906
so...

21:17.677 --> 21:19.879
Okay. Of course.

21:19.912 --> 21:23.716
Well, then, I guess
I'll just see you tonight.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.391
Uh, weird, huh?

21:31.424 --> 21:33.326
What the heck?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.328
Let's have a meal, huh?

21:35.362 --> 21:36.496
As friends.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.064
Why not?

21:38.097 --> 21:39.932
As friends.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.807
Oh, and I can't sit
on the ground

21:47.840 --> 21:50.377
'cause of my new titanium hip.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.779
Yes, ma'am, you
mentioned that.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.846
Come on, 50 bucks

21:53.880 --> 21:56.015
and I will do your
chemistry homework for a month.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.418
100 bucks plus geometry,
and you have

21:58.451 --> 22:00.820
to convince my daddy to
let me have a tattoo.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.021
And when the time comes,

22:02.054 --> 22:05.358
I want birth control,
no questions asked.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.959
Dream on.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.629
Front row tickets
to Taylor Swift next month,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.564
I will drive you so you don't
have to go with your dad.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.766
Plus, I won't tell your dad
that you bid on

22:13.800 --> 22:15.868
Wade's basket,
which will spare you

22:15.902 --> 22:17.637
from a month
of being grounded.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.540
You wait in the parking lot
at Taylor Swift.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.841
Deal.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.382
So... shall we?

22:32.819 --> 22:34.921
So, like I said,

22:34.954 --> 22:37.724
I-I was planning to have
this picnic with Ruby.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.026
Yes, like you said
several times.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.694
What is it about
the silly picnic

22:41.728 --> 22:43.463
that's got you all...

22:45.565 --> 22:47.166
Wow.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.602
So, like I said...

22:49.636 --> 22:53.873
What is she, like, the queen
of the fairies or something?

22:53.906 --> 22:56.609
I mean...

22:56.643 --> 22:59.546
Ruby is one lucky woman.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.484
I mean, it's so thoughtful
and romantic.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.686
You should've seen it
before I downsized.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.557
I had this whole...
gondola theme going.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.625
A gondola?

23:14.026 --> 23:15.127
With a gondolier?

23:15.161 --> 23:16.996
Yeah.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.931
It was bad.
(sighs)

23:22.168 --> 23:23.736
Hey.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.105
Hey.
Sorry.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.007
I just had to pop into
the doctor's office

23:28.040 --> 23:29.476
to go to the little girl's room.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.677
No problem.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.011
Uh... after you.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.514
Why, thank you.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.749
(clears throat)

23:36.783 --> 23:38.150
Look what I found
in the office.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.521
The Book of Amazing
 Facts and Feats.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.889
Yep.
Wow.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.992
Yeah, I use it to distract kids
when I'm giving them a shot.
(laughs)

23:46.025 --> 23:47.794
Uh, you planning on
giving me a shot, or...

23:47.827 --> 23:49.195
No.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.464
Okay, but listen.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.100
Do you know the world record
for a guy walking on his hands?

23:55.201 --> 23:57.003
870 miles.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.005
I mean, why would
anyone want to do that?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.773
I... I don't know.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.174
Why would anyone

24:02.208 --> 24:03.943
bring a book on a date?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.878
No reason.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.814
It's a joke.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.082
Who needs a book?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.784
We can have
a normal conversation,

24:11.818 --> 24:13.085
people do it all the time.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.220
I mean...
it's just talking, right?

24:14.253 --> 24:16.556
I mean, they teach
parrots to do it.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.725
Parrots can talk.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.729
Have you heard about
those six-legged frogs

24:22.762 --> 24:24.697
they sometimes find
in polluted waters?

24:26.265 --> 24:28.568
(clears throat)

24:47.253 --> 24:49.856
Mmm...

24:49.889 --> 24:53.025
You know, I have never had
this brand of cracker before.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.994
They're very crisp.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.100
Well, I know you like the ones
with, uh, stuff in 'em.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.040
Well, these got,
uh, cracked pepper

25:08.074 --> 25:09.909
and...
Okay. Enough.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.010
You know?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.646
We have been talking about
crackers for three minutes!

25:13.680 --> 25:14.847
Uh...

25:14.881 --> 25:17.083
Look, we are acting all nervous,
but there's no reason to be.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.751
Well, I'm not.
No, I know.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.687
I mean, it... there's
no reason to be, right?

25:20.720 --> 25:23.956
I mean, we have seen
each other naked, and way more.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.291
Yeah.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.559
Hey, how about some wine?

25:27.927 --> 25:30.129
You have alcohol?

25:30.162 --> 25:32.298
Why did we not
start with this?

25:32.331 --> 25:34.266
Uh...

25:35.802 --> 25:36.769
Crap.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.638
What?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.206
I don't have a corkscrew.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.645
You telling me I could put
together an entire outfit

25:45.678 --> 25:47.179
without even looking
inside my closet?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.015
That's how I picked out
what I'm wearing today.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.617
No.
No, yeah.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.718
I was like, okay...

25:51.751 --> 25:53.319
dress, boom...
sweater, bam.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.721
Bam.
Shoes...

25:54.754 --> 25:57.089
voilà.
Here I am.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.290
(laughs)

25:58.324 --> 26:00.793
That is amazing,
what can be done.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.630
I'm sorry, you can't be
all that interested in

26:03.663 --> 26:05.665
an app for clothes.
Well, no, no...

26:05.698 --> 26:07.166
I also have
an app for hair.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.769
Oh, well, no...
you know...
I'm just kidding,
I don't.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.104
But look.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.239
Fireflies.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.343
Oh...

26:17.376 --> 26:18.344
(laughs)

26:18.377 --> 26:19.979
Can I have your corkscrew?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.782
Well, not now.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.016
We haven't even used it yet.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.152
Well, can you use it real quick
so I can have it? I'll wait.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.654
We're trying to
have a date here.

26:27.687 --> 26:28.788
ZOE:
Come on.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.590
I'll take the next two
overnight shifts at the office.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.094
Make it three,
and you got a deal.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.096
Man, you Breelands
are hard-asses.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.366
Seriously?

26:40.399 --> 26:42.268
A taquito-strudel
sandwich?

26:42.301 --> 26:43.970
Come on.
Just try it.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.705
Okay.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.747
Mm.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.015
Mm...

26:56.048 --> 26:57.016
Uh-uh.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.617
No. Nope. Uh-uh.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.053
Oh, my God.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.723
Do you actually
like that?
No.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.258
I just wanted to see if
I could get you to eat it.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.094
Really?
Mm-hmm.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.796
Oh, you got me.
(laughing)

27:09.829 --> 27:11.330
Oh... Very humorous.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.832
Ah...

27:12.865 --> 27:14.400
(laughing)

27:14.433 --> 27:16.736
So...

27:16.769 --> 27:18.104
We have, uh,
successfully conquered

27:18.137 --> 27:19.238
the heights of BlueBell.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.673
Mm-hmm.
What's the next

27:20.707 --> 27:21.874
unpredictable thing
you want to do?

27:21.908 --> 27:24.944
You want to...
want to sneak into the church?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.313
Rearrange
Reverend Mayfair's Bibles?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.081
Were you serious about that?

27:29.115 --> 27:30.850
Wanting to do
something unpredictable?

27:32.118 --> 27:34.086
Absolutely.
Good.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.221
'Cause we're gonna
steal a dog.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.990
(chuckles)

27:38.024 --> 27:41.160
It's like I think
if I don't mention

27:41.193 --> 27:43.696
Ruby's leaving, she won't.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.397
But she is.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.066
She bought an apartment.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.100
Bought.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.236
How is this gonna work?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.138
Listen, Lavon,
I know that it's hard,

27:52.171 --> 27:56.075
but if you really care about
her, you'll make it work.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.813
(romantic violin music plays)

28:02.949 --> 28:05.017
Oh, man.

28:05.051 --> 28:08.454
I really hope that violin
music is playing in my head.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.923
Nope.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.725
Forgot to cancel that.

28:12.759 --> 28:13.993
Yeah.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.895
(chuckling)

28:15.928 --> 28:18.898
Oh, gentlemen,
my apologies. Uh,

28:18.931 --> 28:20.399
the serenade is off,
b-but thank you.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.768
Yes, thank you.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.770
Such a beautiful signora.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.172
You pay for an hour,

28:26.205 --> 28:28.140
we play for an hour!
Oh, no.
(chuckles)

28:28.174 --> 28:29.942
That's very kind
of you, but we...
No, we won't be needing

28:29.976 --> 28:30.977
your services at all.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.478
Definitely don't need that.
MAN: Si, signore,

28:32.511 --> 28:35.081
we play until you dance.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.319
(chuckling)

28:40.352 --> 28:42.955
The world's largest clam is
No.

28:42.989 --> 28:47.393
the Tridacna derasa,
found in the South Pacific.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.895
Can I just say, it's no wonder

28:48.928 --> 28:50.096
kids let you
give 'em a shot,

28:50.129 --> 28:51.230
'cause they just want you
to shut up.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.331
Hey!

28:52.364 --> 28:53.766
(laughing)

28:53.800 --> 28:55.267
GEORGE:
Hey, guys!
Hey, Tucker,

28:55.301 --> 28:56.335
where you guys going?

28:56.368 --> 28:58.370
Uh, apparently to steal a dog,

28:58.404 --> 29:00.406
I-I think.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.275
Wow. Good ol' Tansy.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.276
Keeping Georgie-boy

29:04.310 --> 29:05.845
on his toes.

29:05.878 --> 29:06.946
You know, this blind auction

29:06.979 --> 29:08.981
throws together
the wackiest couples.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.449
Oh, they didn't get
thrown together.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.984
Th-They're dating.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.486
They're what?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.923
Yeah. No, I mean,
I'm okay with it.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.960
You know, he asked
my permission and all, so...

29:20.993 --> 29:22.061
(scoffs)

29:22.094 --> 29:24.130
Oh, wait.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.899
No, Wade, stop.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.135
This is not about me
being jealous,

29:29.168 --> 29:31.838
okay? I'm just surprised
because George said

29:31.871 --> 29:33.906
that he was, you know,
gonna start dating girls

29:33.940 --> 29:35.842
that were serious contenders.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.409
And now Tansy?
Come on, I give it a week.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.278
And why is that?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.380
Because they're-they're
just so different, you know?

29:41.413 --> 29:43.382
Tansy's the type
of girl that goes to

29:43.415 --> 29:46.152
Monster Truck Madness
with guys named Colt,

29:46.185 --> 29:48.387
aka Todd Gainey Jr.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.823
So what you're saying is...

29:50.857 --> 29:54.126
if two people don't have
much in common, they...

29:54.160 --> 29:56.896
they can't make it as a couple.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.464
That's good to know.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.000
No, Wade, no. That's not...
What, because,
you know,

30:01.033 --> 30:03.435
if George and Tansy
can't make it, then, uh...

30:03.469 --> 30:05.204
Well, what are you
doing, you know?

30:05.237 --> 30:06.438
You asked me
on this date,

30:06.472 --> 30:07.573
and I said yes.
Yeah, and you

30:07.606 --> 30:09.508
brought a book along
'cause you didn't

30:09.541 --> 30:10.943
think we'd have anything
to talk about.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.913
And I was...
I was totally wrong.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.215
We had, um...

30:16.248 --> 30:17.549
crackers.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.487
You know... Why'd you even
agree to this?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.055
Why did you push
for it to happen?

30:23.089 --> 30:24.957
You know, everything was fine.
I was happy!

30:24.991 --> 30:26.158
Yeah, well, I wasn't happy.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.593
Maybe I wasn't happy

30:27.626 --> 30:31.097
being a-a placeholder
for George Tucker.
What?

30:31.130 --> 30:32.965
You know what,
forget it, all right?

30:32.999 --> 30:34.901
I don't want to evolve.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.635
Excuse me, Doc,
I-I'm going back

30:36.668 --> 30:39.305
to my cave, all right? I'm out.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.418
(dog barking)
Hey, Dolly Parton,

30:52.451 --> 30:54.020
baby, just sit tight!

30:54.053 --> 30:55.421
Mama's coming for you.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.522
When you said
steal a dog,

30:56.555 --> 30:58.457
I guess it sounded like
wacky fun, but this is...

30:58.490 --> 31:00.159
this is turning into
breaking and entering.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.095
You said you wanted
to be less predictable.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.631
Ever bust open a window?
Yeah, less
predictable...

31:05.664 --> 31:06.765
Uh, well, can
you please

31:06.798 --> 31:09.368
stop before this date
becomes a legal consultation?

31:09.401 --> 31:12.004
If I get arrested,
will you be my lawyer?

31:12.038 --> 31:14.173
That'd be so cute!
(chuckles)

31:14.206 --> 31:16.242
Okay, back up, baby.
Back up, baby!

31:19.979 --> 31:20.980
Okay, wait, wait.

31:21.013 --> 31:21.948
Wait. Wait.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.217
For the record, this is

31:25.251 --> 31:26.585
crazy. Um...
Yeah.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.287
But you are a lady.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.923
And since I am clearly

31:30.957 --> 31:32.391
going to be an accessory

31:32.424 --> 31:33.559
to this crime,

31:33.592 --> 31:34.560
well, then...

31:34.593 --> 31:37.263
BlueBell

31:37.296 --> 31:39.365
can kiss my predictable

31:39.398 --> 31:40.132
ass.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.501
Lavon, it's me.

31:42.534 --> 31:45.504
It's one thing to blow off my
calls for Ruby but for a picnic

31:45.537 --> 31:46.973
with Lemon?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.374
Anyway, things got

31:48.407 --> 31:50.943
really weird on my date
with Wade and I really...

31:50.977 --> 31:52.244
TANSY:
Dr. Hart.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.613
We need your help.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.582
And they just got weirder.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.418
(grunts)
H...

31:59.451 --> 32:01.053
(chuckles)
Don't ask.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.091
(romantic violin music playing)

32:19.238 --> 32:22.208
(laughing)

32:23.675 --> 32:26.512
(chuckling)

32:26.545 --> 32:28.714
You know, sometimes I...

32:28.747 --> 32:32.018
think about the time
we had together.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.453
So many good things,

32:34.486 --> 32:37.256
mixed with all that...

32:37.289 --> 32:38.524
pain.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.260
But I want
you to know

32:41.293 --> 32:42.494
I don't regret one minute.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.096
No.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.333
You, Lemon Breeland,
were my first true love.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.501
And I'll never forget you.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.537
(chuckles)
And to be honest,

32:51.570 --> 32:53.439
me being with Ruby, I...

32:53.472 --> 32:55.307
Well, I owe that to you.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.608
Really?

32:56.642 --> 32:58.144
How's that?

32:58.177 --> 32:59.645
You opened my eyes.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.548
Taught me what
a real relationship could be.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.217
I think that's why
I'm acting

33:05.251 --> 33:09.221
so crazy with Ruby
and afraid of her leaving...

33:09.255 --> 33:12.991
'cause I know that we,
we have something real.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.794
Uh...

33:15.827 --> 33:20.266
I have no doubt in my mind
that you, Lavon Hayes,

33:20.299 --> 33:21.667
will find true happiness.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.704
As will I.

33:25.737 --> 33:29.141
So I thank you
for the lunch

33:29.175 --> 33:30.276
and for the dance.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.013
It was lovely.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.424
So let me get
this straight.

33:45.457 --> 33:49.095
You committed a misdemeanor
to steal a dog?

33:49.128 --> 33:51.730
George Tucker, the lawyer?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.665
Actually, it's a Class C felony.

33:53.699 --> 33:57.436
Oh! Nice!

33:57.469 --> 34:00.506
So you have dated Tansy
for all of about
five minutes,

34:00.539 --> 34:04.076
and you're already
a wisecracking wheelman
in a gangster movie!

34:05.677 --> 34:08.313
Doesn't anyone just
want to stay who they are?

34:08.347 --> 34:10.248
Okay, look, I know
that stealing a dog's

34:10.282 --> 34:13.518
a little bit crazy,
but I gotta admit
it was kinda fun.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.422
Give me back my dog, you thief!

34:18.424 --> 34:20.259
Oh, goody,
more fun.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.560
You can't take her!

34:21.592 --> 34:23.129
She doesn't
even like you!

34:23.161 --> 34:24.830
Look!

34:24.862 --> 34:27.199
That's just PTSD from
her recent abduction!

34:27.233 --> 34:29.534
Now let go, or I'm
calling the sheriff!

34:29.568 --> 34:31.670
Okay, listen, Evelyn,
there's no need to do that.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.239
Let's just all take a deep
breath and calm down.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.241
Just a little bit.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.442
Who the hell are you?

34:36.475 --> 34:38.577
And why do you
know my name?

34:38.610 --> 34:41.580
Because... I, I'm Miss,
Miss Kinsella's, Kinsella's...?

34:41.612 --> 34:43.382
Truitt. I went back
to my real name.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.284
Oh. Because I'm Miss Truitt's
lawyer, and she has

34:46.318 --> 34:48.786
retained me
to settle this matter
once and for all.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.489
Now, who paid the adoption fees
for this dog?

34:51.523 --> 34:53.625
I did. Miss Truitt.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.826
Okay, well, then, Evelyn,

34:54.860 --> 34:56.895
you and I would have
to be both blind

34:56.928 --> 34:58.029
and deaf to not agree

34:58.063 --> 35:01.667
that clearly, Dolly Parton
wishes to return to Tansy.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.835
Which makes this dog
an animus revertendi.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.338
I was told it was
mostly pit bull.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.441
Under Alabama state law,
any animal who has a habit

35:09.475 --> 35:12.178
of returning to its owner--
as long as said owner has

35:12.211 --> 35:14.213
established care and
responsibility

35:14.246 --> 35:17.216
for the animal--
which paying the adoption fees

35:17.249 --> 35:20.352
clearly does-- well,
then that animal is
deemed to be

35:20.386 --> 35:22.521
the sole property of said owner.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.724
Meaning what, exactly?

35:25.757 --> 35:28.160
Meaning give me back
my freaking dog!

35:28.194 --> 35:30.296
Put succinctly, yes.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.630
You know what?

35:31.663 --> 35:35.234
You can keep
your damn mutt!

35:35.267 --> 35:37.236
I got Todd Gainey Jr.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.505
(laughs)
Double win!

35:39.538 --> 35:41.207
Oh!

35:41.240 --> 35:43.942
(sobbing)

35:43.975 --> 35:45.611
TANSY: Oh, my God,
that was amazing!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.546
(George chuckles)

35:56.822 --> 35:58.390
(chuckles)

35:58.424 --> 36:00.259
Don't worry, you're next!

36:00.292 --> 36:02.961
Was any of that actually true?

36:02.994 --> 36:06.198
Ah, well, you know, the law's
a living document, all that.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.165
(chuckles)

36:07.199 --> 36:10.402
So, maybe "wisecracking
wheelman" suits you.

36:10.436 --> 36:13.939
You two actually make
a nice picture.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.676
Yeah. Yeah, it's not a picture
I ever... pictured, but...

36:17.709 --> 36:20.412
Yeah, she does bring out
a side of you.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.848
She does, doesn't she?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.417
Maybe that's it;

36:25.451 --> 36:28.554
maybe life's not a picture.
Maybe it's a movie.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.457
And I, for one, am curious
to see how this one ends.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.293
Hey!
This is Dolly Parton!

36:34.326 --> 36:35.661
(George laughs)

36:44.570 --> 36:45.904
(crowd cheering)

36:45.937 --> 36:47.806
(upbeat country playing)

36:47.839 --> 36:52.311
* You took something of mine,
and I want it back *

36:52.344 --> 36:54.646
* I don't remember saying
it was yours to have *

36:54.680 --> 36:59.251
* And if I did,
don't rub it in like that... *

37:00.986 --> 37:01.820
(chuckles)

37:01.853 --> 37:04.523
See? You just, like,
you just catapult

37:04.556 --> 37:06.992
the bird so it
hits the pig.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.560
Oh! Whoa! Lordy, Lordy!

37:08.594 --> 37:10.329
Now I know why
my daughter has

37:10.362 --> 37:12.464
her cell phone glued
to her body all that time.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.865
Yes, it's addictive.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.369
Listen, thank you so much
for the education.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.271
Well, just because
school's out

37:19.305 --> 37:22.341
doesn't mean the teacher's
gotta go home.

37:22.374 --> 37:23.875
Let's dance!

37:23.909 --> 37:25.611
* Don't do me like that

37:25.644 --> 37:27.746
* The road is smooth,
there's a Cadillac *

37:27.779 --> 37:30.416
* Now I'm running around
town chasing tire tracks *

37:30.449 --> 37:31.817
* You stole my heart

37:31.850 --> 37:38.490
* And I want, I want, I want,
I want it back *

37:38.524 --> 37:40.258
Hazelnut truffles.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.363
Such a "comedy of errors,"
in keeping with

37:44.396 --> 37:45.897
our Shakespeare theme.
(chuckles)

37:45.931 --> 37:48.334
I wonder if tonight
matched up any

37:48.367 --> 37:50.336
star-crossed lovers.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.504
It's hard to say.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.474
How was your date?
Any sparks fly with Delma?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.976
Only when her new hip grazed
the water fountain.

37:58.009 --> 37:58.777
(laughs)

37:58.810 --> 37:59.911
What about you?

37:59.945 --> 38:01.813
How was your date
with the mayor?

38:01.847 --> 38:04.015
It was fine.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.018
Mayor Hayes and I are
friends,

38:07.052 --> 38:10.856
but we both belonged, um...
elsewhere.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.025
Glad to hear it.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.061
Well, seeing as how
we've both managed

38:16.094 --> 38:19.931
to free ourselves and
the night is young...

38:19.965 --> 38:22.968
would you care to join me
for dessert?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.803
Absolutely.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.071
(chuckles)

38:26.104 --> 38:28.874
* And yeah, I want it back

38:30.442 --> 38:34.079
* Give it back.

38:34.112 --> 38:36.348
(band plays flourish)

38:36.382 --> 38:38.417
Whoo!

38:38.450 --> 38:39.418
(song ends)

38:39.451 --> 38:42.921
Hey, Z.
Got your messages.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.690
How was y'all's first date?

38:44.723 --> 38:45.724
A disaster.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.428
Maybe some people can
overcome their differences,

38:49.461 --> 38:51.997
but Wade and I...?
I shouldn't have gone.

38:53.965 --> 38:57.536
Why does everyone have
to change, you know?

38:57.569 --> 38:59.838
I changed my whole life
to come here.

38:59.871 --> 39:00.972
Isn't that enough?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.141
I need one of those
remote controls

39:03.174 --> 39:05.977
where you can pause life,

39:06.011 --> 39:08.414
to make everyone stop
where they are.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.749
Those don't exist, you know?

39:12.884 --> 39:15.754
Hey, hey,
give it back.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.527
*

39:29.835 --> 39:31.169
Hey.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.871
Hey.

39:32.904 --> 39:36.141
I'm glad you're here.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.477
Well, I snuck in
in the back.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.446
You know, in case
there are

39:40.479 --> 39:43.882
any rules about the mayor having
female company after dark.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.418
(chuckles)

39:53.925 --> 39:56.562
I'm sorry we didn't go
on our date.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.032
Lavon, I know you're freaking
out about me going to Dallas.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.468
Yeah.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.170
But do you want
to know why I'm not?

40:05.203 --> 40:09.040
'Cause I know we have
what it takes to make it.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.510
And that long-distance thing,

40:11.543 --> 40:13.912
it's, it's not gonna
change that.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.547
I'm sure of it.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.751
I hope so.

40:19.785 --> 40:25.123
I realized something tonight,
that, um...

40:25.156 --> 40:27.926
(chuckles)

40:27.959 --> 40:30.796
I love you.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.566
(chuckles)

40:34.600 --> 40:36.468
Um...

40:36.502 --> 40:39.971
I love you, too.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.973
