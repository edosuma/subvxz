00:01.240 --> 00:02.839
Welcome to Bristol.

00:02.840 --> 00:04.559
I really feel
that we could be mates.

00:04.560 --> 00:08.439
They're not your mates.
They're my mates.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.439
Now get the fuck out of my party.

00:10.440 --> 00:10.879
I had a good time last night.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.039
I had a good time last night.
Me too.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.799
It was perfect, I loved it.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.879
Can you just hold up
for one fucking second?!

00:17.880 --> 00:19.359
Should you be talking to me?

00:19.360 --> 00:20.959
Mini's not my friend any more.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.919
Are we still friends?

00:21.920 --> 00:25.919
Are we still friends?
I was hoping more than that.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.679
I know you haven't slept together.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.319
Anything you want to tell me?

00:30.320 --> 00:31.439
I love you.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.439
Keep your whore hands away from him.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.279
Hey, babes.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.079
'Still at the rugby?'

01:43.080 --> 01:44.359
'Still at the rugby?'
No, the rugby do's done.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.639
I'm just on my way home
with the boys.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.639
We stopped off for... Pop-Tarts.
See you soon. Love you too.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.639
This is never happening again.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.639
You said that last time.
And you called me, remember?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.239
You love it!

02:03.240 --> 02:07.239
More than you know.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.799
Mum?

02:50.800 --> 02:54.359
Every night for a week, you turn
up looking like a zombie, Olivia.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.359
Do not tell me
there is nothing to worry about,

02:56.360 --> 02:59.039
your entire aura
is telling me quite the opposite.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.599
Mum, I'm fine.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.839
You are not fine, Olivia,
you are out of control.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.279
Where the hell is it? What?
The purple one. My amethyst.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.719
If I show up at the Eternal Circle
without my own crystals,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.239
I'll look like a bloody day-tripper!

03:10.240 --> 03:11.319
Have you hidden it?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.759
Why would I do that?!

03:12.760 --> 03:14.279
I don't know, Olivia.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.279
I don't know why any of you do
any of the things that you do.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.639
Is that it?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.559
You're welcome.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.559
Thank you.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.999
Maude! Breakfast.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.079
This retreat could be a real
breakthrough for me, you know?

03:42.080 --> 03:45.799
Healing.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.799
Maude, your hair looks insane.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.319
You haven't been up all night
reading again, have you?

03:50.320 --> 03:51.919
Fine. Be like that, then.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.359
So I'm leaving on
a sour note, am I?

03:59.360 --> 03:59.919
No...

03:59.920 --> 04:03.919
No...
Well, that's how it feels.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.159
See you in a couple of days.
And I'm trusting you with the house.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.359
I liked it better
when she was into aliens.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.719
Houdini! What happened to you
at the party last night?

04:35.720 --> 04:37.599
I had to...

04:37.600 --> 04:39.639
Why are you here?

04:39.640 --> 04:43.639
Well, Mini told us to,
but... we're not really sure...

04:44.560 --> 04:47.239
Hi-de-hi! There she is!

04:47.240 --> 04:50.999
Head inside, everyone!
Come on, Nick.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.279
What's going on?

04:52.280 --> 04:54.119
I think someone broke into
my bag last night.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.719
I'm sure that was you.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.919
Nick told me everything.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.919
And I am so sorry.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.759
I'd eaten, like,
one sultana that day.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.759
Everything after my fashion-show
meltdown is kind of a blur.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.119
Did we fight?

05:11.120 --> 05:12.999
You don't remember?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.079
Oh my God, we did.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.719
Can we be friends again?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.239
Just, like, forget the whole thing?

05:20.240 --> 05:22.919
I'm really sorry, Liv.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.839
Yeah... I'd like that.
Yay!

05:25.840 --> 05:29.519
Thanks, Liv.
Come in.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.519
Hi, everybody.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.199
Thanks for joining me here.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.199
This is really difficult.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.359
OK, um, I've been a...

05:45.360 --> 05:49.359
complete bitch. To you all.
Some more than others.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.519
And I'm really sorry.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.639
It's just...

05:56.640 --> 06:00.279
well, you're all so cool
and alternative,

06:00.280 --> 06:04.279
and when I'm with you
I feel like a bit like...

06:04.600 --> 06:08.599
Nicola Roberts.
She's the plain one in Girls Aloud.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.799
Franky, er, you were right.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.359
We could all be awesome mates.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.999
I want that now.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.599
So do, um, Liv and Nick.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.599
So we were wondering if you could
find it in your hearts

06:27.320 --> 06:29.719
to give us a second chance?

06:29.720 --> 06:33.719
Right, guys?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.039
Yeah. Right.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.959
Well, I'm in.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.799
I mean, as long as everything is...

06:42.800 --> 06:44.639
in the past, right?

06:44.640 --> 06:46.599
Dead and buried.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.639
Friends again!

06:47.640 --> 06:48.839
Peace in our time!

06:48.840 --> 06:52.319
This is actually happening, is it

06:52.320 --> 06:53.159
Brilliant.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.359
Brilliant.
Nice one, buddy.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.399
Group hug!

06:56.400 --> 06:57.759
- No, I don't like hugs.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.239
- Amazing.

07:00.240 --> 07:00.879
We're all friends.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.679
We're all friends.
Get off me!

07:02.680 --> 07:05.519
Oh, and, um, look!
I got us all a little present.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.519
My mum's back seeing
that Hell's Angel.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.799
Ta-da!

07:13.800 --> 07:15.599
No-one leaves

07:15.600 --> 07:19.599
till this bag is empty.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.759
If that's really tobacco,
then why's it green?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.319
Tobacco is green.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.439
Then what's she smoking?

07:33.440 --> 07:34.239
Heroin.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.959
Heroin.
He's kidding. It's tobacco.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.959
Why did you tell me that?
What's it like being ginger?

07:41.840 --> 07:45.839
You OK?
Stay away, please.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.559
Do you think she knows?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.919
She can't. How can she?

07:50.920 --> 07:53.399
What are you two whispering about?

07:53.400 --> 07:55.679
Nick's having trouble making
friends.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.199
Oh, sweetie! Just smile and nod
if you're having trouble.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.199
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.079
Mm, this needs some gin.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.079
Er... that's my mum's
expensive stuff.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.599
You were wrong, by the way.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.159
He does love me.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.879
OK.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.079
It's reached a whole new level.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.079
It's weird I used to be that hung up
about sex, when now it's just all the time.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.959
I've got carpet burns on my ears.
So good.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.439
I'm happy for you.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.199
Don't know how
I let it bother me so much.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.359
As if anything could get in the way
of me and Nick being together.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.639
What's going on here?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.558
Everyone's having such a good time.

08:35.559 --> 08:39.558
It really would be a shame
if you spoiled it.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.679
You know what this needs? Sherry.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.159
Hmm. You're right.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.239
OK, I'll go get some.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.479
You do that.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.999
You're coming with me.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.999
Oi!

09:00.440 --> 09:03.879
Who needs fresh air? It's all
over the place. I want to party.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.159
What about the sci-fi season?
You said you wanted to go, right?

09:07.160 --> 09:10.319
Frak, yeah! Mum said I couldn't.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.359
Enjoy.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.519
What about you? What are you doing?

09:13.520 --> 09:16.879
I'll come back soon. Don't worry.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.999
You're going to see Bella,
aren't you?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.199
Why can't I come?
She's my sister too.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.559
Do I love you?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.599
Indeed you do.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.599
See you in a bit.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.159
You all right?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.559
Mmm. Got a blade in my pants.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.399
I've just come from the shower.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.919
Had to sort some bitch for stealing
my shampoo.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.919
She looks a bit like you now.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.799
When are you going to bring
Maude along, man? I miss her.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.559
I don't think Mum'd be too into
that.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.559
Ah. Still trying to keep Mum happy?

10:12.640 --> 10:15.079
For me?

10:15.080 --> 10:18.519
Look, OK. I fucked Nick.
And I know that's wrong, right,

10:18.520 --> 10:22.079
but I think Mini knows, and she's
trying to pretend nothing happened,

10:22.080 --> 10:23.319
and I did it again and...

10:23.320 --> 10:26.639
Why should I feel guilty when Mini's
always fucking playing me?

10:26.640 --> 10:29.679
If she wants to say it never
happened, say it never happened.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.159
Everyone's a winner. Keep it simple.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.199
Yeah, but... Liv!

10:32.200 --> 10:35.879
If I can survive a place like this,
you can say you didn't fuck some boy.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.039
Well, thanks, sis.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.039
Stop being a pussy.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.119
Have I met you before?

11:49.120 --> 11:51.799
You'll have to do better than that.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.439
No, I wasn't trying to...

11:53.440 --> 11:56.159
Whatever.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.239
Oh!

11:59.240 --> 12:01.199
Agh!

12:01.200 --> 12:02.559
I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

12:02.560 --> 12:05.719
Don't worry about it.
I can't run for ever.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.239
Here. Enjoy that.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.239
You make a lovely couple.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.679
Emancipation from the bondage of the
soil is no freedom for the tree.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.799
Come here!
Agh!

12:19.800 --> 12:22.559
Thanks for your help there, miss.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.839
You're welcome.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.319
I'm arresting you
for possession of Class A drugs.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.319
You don't have to say anything...

12:35.760 --> 12:39.759
Oi! Where are you going?
Haven't decided yet.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.719
That's mine.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.279
Well, he gave it to me.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.359
Because he thought you were with me.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.479
Well, I'm not.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.479
What was it, anyway?

12:59.280 --> 13:03.279
Ooh! You ever seen
crystals that colour before?

13:03.440 --> 13:04.679
No.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.799
Let's do it.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.959
I don't know who you are.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.759
So? It'll be fun.
Fun?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.399
I'm just trying
to get out of this shithole.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.119
I hate this town too.

13:14.120 --> 13:18.119
Let's get fucked, burn it to the
ground, dance on the embers,

13:18.240 --> 13:22.239
and then you can get on your coach.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.519
Done.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.119
Let's go.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.079
So, what are we going to do, then?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.879
Well, we stole this day.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.479
It doesn't count.
So we can do what we want.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.519
We're going to need to make
some rules, though.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.559
What?

13:43.560 --> 13:46.999
Keep it simple.
No future, no names, no touching.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.519
This is not a hook-up.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.599
I've got interpersonal issues.
And syphilis.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.679
OK.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.239
The reason I chose you is cos
you're little, and I do karate.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.559
This is, like, a one-day-only deal.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.999
And if I see you on the street
tomorrow,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.399
I am going to blank you,
so don't get weepy about it.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.399
Fine. I'm leaving tomorrow.
Good.

14:13.080 --> 14:17.079
Bombs away.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.799
So we just wait, do we?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.039
Till we come up?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.319
Hmm.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.079
We could get some booze...

14:28.080 --> 14:32.079
but I've haven't any money.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.679
Do we need money?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.359
Let's see.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.359
Thank you. Have a nice day.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.479
Gordon? It's your wife.
The twins have found your figurines,

15:12.480 --> 15:14.279
and one of them's choking on a
hobbit.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.319
Which one?

15:15.320 --> 15:16.919
It's not Frodo, is it?
That's valuable.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.719
Which kid, you idiot?

15:18.720 --> 15:22.719
For God's sake, this is all I need.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.999
Yes, darling. I can hear you.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.839
Calm down!

15:29.840 --> 15:33.839
Thanks.
Come again.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.719
I'm stealing this.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.719
Just go.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.839
Bye!

15:45.840 --> 15:47.959
Oi! Stop those kids!

15:47.960 --> 15:51.959
Whoo-hoo!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.959
How you feeling?
Amazing.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.719
You dick. He could have caught us!

16:02.720 --> 16:05.559
What's the point of doing it
if you don't enjoy the chase?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.519
You're a bad influence.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.879
Who's that?

16:14.880 --> 16:15.959
My husband.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.719
Really? Fuck him.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.679
You've shoplifted before,
haven't you?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.439
Everything I'm wearing I stole.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.159
Sweet. Give me your watch, then.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.399
No, this was a gift.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.039
My brother gave it to me.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.639
Everything else, though, was nicked.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.319
My sister took me shoplifting once.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.439
She had this special coat
with massive pockets.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.119
Yeah? Can I have her number?

16:37.120 --> 16:40.239
Have you no shame?

16:40.240 --> 16:43.839
No. You can take all this back
to the garage if you really want to.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.839
I'm sure he'd be happy
to see us again.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.359
Tricky, without receipts.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.639
Cheers.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.119
You're not real.

16:54.120 --> 16:58.119
You're like a Charles Dickens
character named Teddy Sextramp.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.519
What do you think?

16:59.520 --> 17:00.559
Teddy Sextramp?

17:00.560 --> 17:03.599
Teddy Sextramp, who I met
with drug dealers and police,

17:03.600 --> 17:04.638
and we go shoplifting,

17:04.640 --> 17:07.199
and who said it was OK to look
at strangers that way?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.039
Cos it's too much, Teddy. And yes,
I would say yes. I'm coming up.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.118
How about you?

17:11.119 --> 17:14.919
I think so. How are my pupils?

17:14.920 --> 17:17.079
Open your mouth and say "ah".

17:17.079 --> 17:19.039
Arrrgh!

18:05.960 --> 18:09.959
Let's check it out.

18:15.400 --> 18:19.079
Hello?Hello?

18:19.080 --> 18:23.079
Hello?

18:37.600 --> 18:41.599
Whoo!

19:17.760 --> 19:21.759
Don't worry. She doesn't bite.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.599
Can I help you?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.479
Oh, we're just browsing...

19:27.480 --> 19:30.639
Just browsing at your rat.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.239
She's a mouse.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.519
I made the whiskers myself.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.199
I have a wonderful three-piece suit
that would fit you, young man.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.199
Hmm... Ah!

19:44.440 --> 19:47.639
And for the lady...

19:47.640 --> 19:51.639
Yes. Yes, try it on.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.879
We'll leave you to it.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.159
I might just hang out with her.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.079
How's this?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.239
Sharp.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.239
See if you like the lining.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.919
No, I'm in here.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.839
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
looking up, into the camera, there.

20:38.840 --> 20:39.999
Now, let me help.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.079
What are you doing?

20:41.080 --> 20:43.479
I wouldn't normally,
but you seem so accommodating.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.519
No. I don't want to!

20:44.520 --> 20:45.639
Take it off!

20:45.640 --> 20:47.079
Get off me! Get off me!

20:47.080 --> 20:48.239
I need to see you!

20:48.240 --> 20:49.399
Oi!

20:50.760 --> 20:51.799
Argh!

20:53.040 --> 20:56.199
Fucking perv.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.479
Evidence.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.799
Need to get that fucking CCTV tape.
Where is it?

21:02.800 --> 21:06.799
Got it.

21:07.080 --> 21:11.079
Today, we take this perv's dosh
and rinse him dry.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.479
Tape, money, let's go.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.479
Hello?

21:18.480 --> 21:22.479
Hello, is anyone there?
I need to return my costume.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.599
We need to get out of here.

21:26.600 --> 22:09.479

22:09.480 --> 22:13.479
What's the matter?

22:15.280 --> 22:19.279
Starting to hurt.

22:20.080 --> 22:24.079
Is there any more?

22:29.160 --> 22:33.159
Table manners.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.679
The rules.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.479
It still hurts.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.879
That means nothing. Trust me.

22:52.880 --> 22:56.879
My hand kills from when I punched
my brother, but he was fine.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.319
And the perv will be too.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.879
It's OK.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.879
We did nothing wrong.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.119
Anyway, we were never there,
remember?

23:17.400 --> 23:19.079
I still think we should check.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.999
OK.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.599
It's not a good idea.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.999
OK. We just walk past, yeah?
Casual.

23:26.000 --> 23:26.759
Casual.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.759
Casual.
Casual.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.799
Shit! Cops!

23:41.280 --> 23:42.319
He's dead.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.759
Pervs don't die. He'll be back.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.759
Well, he's hurt, right?

23:49.640 --> 23:52.599
Where were you going today,
with your bag?

23:52.600 --> 23:55.759
Don't know. Away.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.399
Into the countryside somewhere.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.399
Can I come? Can we go together?

24:01.760 --> 24:04.839
Are you serious?

24:04.840 --> 24:06.279
Yeah.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.399
Fuck that guy. We'll just go.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.839
We'll run away.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.279
Refill?

24:12.280 --> 24:16.279
Refill.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.719
Where are we going to go?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.359
Let's go first thing tomorrow.

24:24.360 --> 24:28.359
We're not done with tonight yet.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.599
Whatever we do,

24:38.600 --> 24:40.999
it's you and me.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.559
You and me. Always.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.759
This is real, right?

24:45.760 --> 24:49.759
This is real.

27:11.320 --> 27:15.239
Let's go. Yeah?

27:15.240 --> 27:19.239
Long-Haired Child

27:45.200 --> 27:47.799
Richard... Richard!

27:47.800 --> 27:51.199
You fell asleep,
you fucking amateur!

27:51.200 --> 27:52.039
No, I didn't.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.879
Oh. Franky's gone.
What a lightweight.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.239
Olivia?

27:58.240 --> 27:59.279
That's my name.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.239
It's lovely.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.879
Didn't even get the sherry.

28:08.720 --> 28:12.719
What the hell are you doing?
That's my bed.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.879
And I'm in it with my boyfriend.

28:14.880 --> 28:18.439
Whatever. I'm out of here, anyway.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.799
Who's he?

28:21.800 --> 28:24.279
Hi. Sorry. I'm Matty.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.799
Matty?

28:25.800 --> 28:29.639
Matty.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.039
Matthew? What the fuck?

28:32.040 --> 28:33.759
Nicholas?

28:33.760 --> 28:36.479
Have I missed something?

28:36.480 --> 28:40.479
Yeah. He's my brother. >

28:43.000 --> 28:45.919
Shit. They're brothers.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.919
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
We're just leaving.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.159
Nick!

28:51.160 --> 28:54.039
Whatever he's told you,
don't believe him. He's a psycho.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.679
Why do you care? >

28:56.680 --> 29:00.679
You've got to be shitting me.
You and her? >

29:11.120 --> 29:13.319
Party is over.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.439
Everybody out!

29:14.440 --> 29:15.039
Liv...

29:15.040 --> 29:16.279
Don't touch me!

29:16.280 --> 29:17.279
Whatever's going on, I don't care.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.599
Yeah, well, I do. >

29:19.600 --> 29:23.599
I don't care about him.
It's you and me. >

29:28.600 --> 29:32.599
I don't know you...
and I don't trust you.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.799
So get the fuck out of my house.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.399
And the rest of you.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.399
Out! >

30:10.240 --> 30:12.359
Franky!

30:12.360 --> 30:16.359
Where is everyone?

30:17.040 --> 30:18.039
Party's over.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.239
Oh.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.759
and leave me alone?

30:31.520 --> 30:33.719
What's going on with you and Mini?

30:33.720 --> 30:35.239
What do you care?

30:35.240 --> 30:37.119
It's between me and her.

30:39.720 --> 30:43.719
All that hate and blame is...

30:43.960 --> 30:44.639
toxic.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.759
Or are you just
a bit too fucking sensitive?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.439
I watched this earlier.

31:02.440 --> 31:06.439
Liked it.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.719
Ready?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.839
Good afternoon.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.839
This is the news.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.199
Today, it has been revealed

31:35.200 --> 31:39.199
that geography teacher Mr Beale
has no penis...

31:40.800 --> 31:43.319
but Liv fancies him anyway.

31:43.320 --> 31:47.319
I don't care,
I don't care, I don't care.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.399
Good afternoon.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.399
Today, it was revealed thatKirsty,
Kelly and Marilyn are all slags.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.119
It has also been revealed
that Sam is a fat slag,

32:00.120 --> 32:04.119
Dionne is a dozy slag,and Miss Page
is a total fucking slut.

we can't talk about anything.

Oh, for fuck's sake, Liv!
Just keep it simple!

34:37.880 --> 34:41.478
Our whole family's been trying that,
and we're falling apart.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.159
She deserved what I did to her.

She's a psycho control freak,
who drove Dad away

Every fucking day.

Me and Maude?

37:57.160 --> 37:59.119
Don't kiss me. I stink.

37:59.120 --> 38:03.119
I can handle it.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.759
Did I disgrace myself?

38:12.760 --> 38:16.759
No.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.039
Eurgh!

38:21.040 --> 38:22.719
Eurgh!

38:22.720 --> 38:23.879
Ssh!

38:23.880 --> 38:25.799
We broke into someone's house.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.279
Whose?

38:27.280 --> 38:30.399
Mine.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.399
Who's in here?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nick, it's me.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.719
And me.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.879
Are you OK?

38:35.880 --> 38:39.359
I'm fine.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.639
Better go.

38:40.640 --> 38:44.039
I'll see you.

38:44.040 --> 38:48.039
Thank you.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.439
What are you doing here?

38:51.440 --> 38:54.719
I'm sorry I hit you.

38:54.720 --> 38:58.239
I need to come back.
Please talk to Dad for me.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.679
I thought it was burglars.

38:59.680 --> 39:03.679
I'm sorry.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.279
I'm sorry.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.159
You totally lost it with us, Matty.

39:08.160 --> 39:12.159
Please can you talk to Dad?
I want to come back.

39:14.720 --> 39:18.719
Do you remember
how we became friends?

39:19.720 --> 39:23.639
I'd been crying all morning
and you came over to me.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.639
I thought you were going
to give me a tissue,

39:26.640 --> 39:29.639
like everyone else who knew
what happened.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.999
But instead, you gave me these...

39:32.000 --> 39:34.879
in the middle of winter.

39:34.880 --> 39:38.879
I felt so cool with you.

39:39.440 --> 39:43.439
And we were so much better
than all those nice boys and girls,

39:43.760 --> 39:46.599
like we knew a secret they didn't.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.599
But we don't tell each other
our secrets... do we?

39:57.360 --> 40:00.599
I owe you so much.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.199
Can I try and explain what happened?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.279
Why would you do that?

40:05.280 --> 40:08.559
So we'd have a chance.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.239
I'm so sorry, Mini.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.199
Nick told me you drank a bottle
of vodka to apologise

40:13.200 --> 40:16.519
to his brother.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.519
Funny. Out of all the boys in town,
you ended up with him.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.719
What can I do to make it OK?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.239
Just tell me, I'll do it.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.239
Anything.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.119
You're joking?

40:40.120 --> 40:42.079
You're joking?
If you mean it.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.359
Mins, my stomach is, like, raw.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.999
Good.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.719
Can't we just talk?

40:47.720 --> 40:51.719
After you show me
how sorry you are.

40:52.440 --> 40:52.919
I can't...

40:52.920 --> 40:54.119
I can't...
Do it.

40:54.120 --> 40:58.119
If you're really sorry.

41:21.240 --> 41:25.239
I hope you die puking up
your kidneys. Bitch!

42:18.560 --> 42:22.399
Mum?

42:22.400 --> 42:26.399
Mum, are you here?

42:26.920 --> 42:27.999
Mum?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.559
Maude?

42:29.560 --> 42:33.559
It's me.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.159
What have you been doing?
Look at the state of you, again.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.679
Mum, it's been horrible.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.239
Mini hates me,
I don't know what to do.

42:42.240 --> 42:46.239
It's all a party to you, isn't it? I
trusted you with my house, Olivia.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.559
I'm sorry. How was the retreat?

42:50.560 --> 42:54.559
Pointless. It's all pointless, Liv.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.639
I do know my hobbies are ridiculous.

43:04.080 --> 43:08.079
But I can't just jet away like
your dad, so what can I do?

43:09.800 --> 43:11.439
Maude's out.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.079
Did you see the mess she left
in the kitchen? She's so angry.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.159
What do I do? Send her
away somewhere?

43:17.160 --> 43:18.439
Maude's fine.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.079
Throwing crockery is not fine.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.559
I will not have violence
in this house, Olivia.

43:22.560 --> 43:26.559
Maude didn't throw it.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.679
I did.

43:28.680 --> 43:32.679
Why would you do that?
