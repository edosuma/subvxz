OH, I KNOW THAT,
CHARLES. I'M SORRY.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.318
I UNDERSTAND.

14:19.485 --> 14:20.819
COME ON, CAROLINE.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.739
"PRIDE COMETH
BEFORE DESTRUCTION

14:23.906 --> 14:25.616
AND A HAUGHTY SPIRIT
BEFORE A FALL"--

14:25.783 --> 14:27.785
PROVERBS 16:18.

14:27.952 --> 14:30.663
CORRECTION:
IT IS "PRIDE GOETH
BEFORE DESTRUCTION,"

14:30.829 --> 14:32.081
MRS. OLESON, AND AS
FOR THE REST OF IT,

14:32.248 --> 14:33.499
I'D FALL
IN THE GRAND CANYON

14:33.666 --> 14:35.960
BEFORE I'D
LET MY WIFE GO
BEGGING TO YOU.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.590
[METAL CLANGING]

14:43.092 --> 14:46.345
AH, I LIKE THE IDEA OF
HAVING THE STABLES CLEAN

14:46.512 --> 14:48.138
AND THE HORSES CARED FOR.

14:48.305 --> 14:51.308
I JUST CAN'T AFFORD
THE LUXURY OF PAYING
SOMEBODY TO DO IT.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.102
IT WOULD GIVE YOU
A LOT OF FREE TIME
FOR OTHER THINGS.

14:53.269 --> 14:54.603
AH, TRUE ENOUGH,
BUT...

14:54.770 --> 14:56.981
AW, DAD BURN IT,
CHARLES, TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH,

14:57.147 --> 14:58.732
THE MONEY I COULD
OFFER IS SO SMALL

14:58.899 --> 15:00.901
THAT, WELL, I'M
JUST TOO EMBARRASSED
TO EVEN MENTION IT.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.862
TRY ME, HANS.
I NEED THE WORK.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.906
HOW LONG
DO YOU FIGURE
IT WOULD TAKE YOU

15:06.073 --> 15:08.409
TO CLEAN AND CURRY
EACH DAY?

15:08.576 --> 15:11.370
I'D SAY 2, 3 HOURS
AT THE MOST.

15:11.537 --> 15:14.915
25 CENTS A DAY,
AND I WISH
IT WAS MORE.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.043
DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR GIVING ME A JOB.
I'LL START TOMORROW.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.837
GOOD ENOUGH.

15:20.004 --> 15:21.714
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
ELSE NEEDS ANY WORK DONE
AT THEIR PLACE, DO YOU?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.466
NO, NOT OFFHAND, BUT
IF I HEAR OF ANYTHING,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.552
THANK YOU. SAY HELLO
TO THE MISSUS.

15:26.719 --> 15:28.512
YEAH. YOU DO THE SAME.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.726
HEY, CHARLES'.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.311
MAKAY'.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.107
HOW ARE YOU?

16:22.274 --> 16:25.611
HEY'. TELL ME WHAT
BRINGS YOU OUT THIS WAY.

16:25.778 --> 16:26.737
WELL, I WAS HOPING
I COULD GET A LITTLE
WORK

16:26.904 --> 16:28.155
WITH YOU
ON THE PUG MILL

16:28.322 --> 16:29.490
NOW THAT YOUR BOY'S
GOING TO SCHOOL
FULL-TIME,

16:29.657 --> 16:31.075
AND I SEE
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.744
YEAH. WELL, IT MUST BE
AN UNDERGROUND SPRING
OR SOMETHING.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.038
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST SEEMED
TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.247
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.416
I'LL HAVE TO BUILD ME
A NEW PUG MILL.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.460
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED
IF I COULD HELP YOU
BUILD IT.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.628
I NEED A JOB.

16:42.795 --> 16:45.130
WHY, SURE. I COULDN'T
FIND A BETTER MAN.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.341
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
AS SOON AS I GET STARTED.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.176
WHEN DO YOU THINK
IT WILL BE?

16:49.343 --> 16:50.719
IT WILL HAVE TO BE
AFTER WINTER.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.805
I COULDN'T GET
ANYTHING DONE BEFORE
THE SNOW FLIES,

16:52.971 --> 16:55.391
SO I'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.101
WELL, LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU WANT
TO GET STARTED.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.812
SURE. HEY, LISTEN,
COME IN THE HOUSE AND
HAVE A BIT OF CIDER.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.313
NO. I'VE GOT A LOT
TO DO. THANK YOU.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.190
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.267
WELL, I SEE YOU'VE
CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT THE CIDER.

17:38.434 --> 17:39.977
NO, NO. I DIDN'T.
I JUST WANTED
TO FIND OUT--

17:40.144 --> 17:41.645
WHAT'S IT GOING TO
COST YOU TO BUILD
THAT NEW PUG MILL?

17:41.812 --> 17:45.107
OH, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY,
BUT LIKE I SAID,

17:45.274 --> 17:46.608
I'M NOT GOING TO START
TILL AFTER WINTER.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.277
I KNOW THAT, BUT
WHAT IF YOU COULD
USE THE OLD ONE?

17:48.444 --> 17:51.530
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
A WAY FOR ME MULE
TO WORK UNDERWATER?

17:51.697 --> 17:53.907
NO, BUT I THINK I
CAN GET IT DRAINED.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.743
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.161
THAT...

17:58.996 --> 18:00.330
THAT WOULD BE
A TOUGHER JOB

18:00.497 --> 18:01.540
THAN BUILDING
A NEW PUG MILL.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.209
I NEED THE WORK NOW.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.961
WHY, I DON'T KNOW.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.464
LOOK, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT. I'LL NOT ONLY
DRAIN THE PUG MILL,

18:08.630 --> 18:10.174
I'LL DIG YOU
IRRIGATION DITCHES

18:10.340 --> 18:13.677
SO YOU CAN PLANT
THAT FIELD NEXT TO IT
WITH ANY CROP YOU WANT.

18:13.844 --> 18:14.803
YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

18:14.970 --> 18:17.806
I'D SURE LIKE
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.308
YOU KNOW, IF IT
DON'T WORK OUT,

18:19.475 --> 18:20.392
I CAN'T PAY YOU
ANYTHING.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.269
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.688
HMM.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.815
ALL RIGHT.
COME IN THE HOUSE.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.860
WE'LL FIGURE THE COST
OF THE NEW MILL, AND
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN PAY.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.586
WELL...

18:47.753 --> 18:49.296
IF EVERYTHING GOES
ALL RIGHT AT MAKAY'S,

18:49.463 --> 18:50.339
IT'S GOING TO
TAKE ME 3 MONTHS

18:50.506 --> 18:51.965
TO PAY THE OLESON BILL,

18:52.132 --> 18:54.009
AND THAT'S
DOING WITHOUT.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.056
WELL, MR. OLESON SAID
THAT HE WAS WILLING TO
EXTEND A LITTLE CREDIT.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.517
NO, AND NOT
ON YOUR LIFE,

19:01.683 --> 19:03.519
NOT AFTER WHAT
THAT WOMAN HAD TO SAY.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.770
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

19:04.937 --> 19:05.979
ONCE WE PAY THE BILL
AT THE OLESON'S,

19:06.146 --> 19:07.564
FROM NOW ON, ANYTHING
WE PURCHASE THERE

19:07.731 --> 19:09.942
IS GOING TO BE
CASH ON THE BARREL.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

19:10.108 --> 19:11.902
IT'S NOT ONLY
UNDERSTOOD,

19:12.069 --> 19:14.696
IT'S WHAT WE
HOPED YOU'D SAY.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.282
NOW WE HAVE
SOMETHING WE WANT
TO SAY TO YOU.

19:19.243 --> 19:22.162
PA, I TALKED TO
MRS. WHIPPLE TODAY.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.914
SHE'S GETTING
OLDER, AND...

19:24.081 --> 19:25.666
WELL, HER FINGERS
JUST DON'T DO

19:25.833 --> 19:28.126
EVERYTHING THEY USED
TO WITH A NEEDLE
AND THREAD.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.087
ANYWAY, I ASKED
IF SHE COULD USE ME

19:30.254 --> 19:31.922
FULL-TIME FOR
A WHILE INSTEAD OF
JUST PART-TIME,

19:32.089 --> 19:33.841
AND SHE SAID
SHE SURE COULD.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.301
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME,
YOUNG LADY? THAT YOU WANT TO
QUIT SCHOOL AND GO TO WORK?

19:36.468 --> 19:40.514
IT'S ONLY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
UNTIL WE CATCH UP.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.182
LAURA CAN BRING
MY HOMEWORK HOME.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.309
AND I CAN DO
MARY'S CHORES.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.436
AND MA AND I COULD
SELL THE VEGETABLES.

19:46.603 --> 19:49.857
AND WE CAN PLANT
A DOUBLE-SIZE POTATO
CROP FOR WINTER STORE.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.900
AND I CAN MILK
THE COW.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.237
WE CAN DO IT, PA.
WE CAN HELP.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.739
PLEASE LET US
HELP, PA.

20:22.556 --> 20:23.682
WHAT A FAMILY.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.227
IT DOES MAKE
A MAN PROUD.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.062
THEN YOU'LL LET US?

20:31.899 --> 20:33.567
I COULDN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.859
Reverend:
THANK YOU, CHARLES.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.612
REVEREND, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
STANDING THERE.

22:00.779 --> 22:01.780
HOW ARE YOU?

22:01.947 --> 22:03.657
FINE. I HEARD YOU WERE
WORKING OUT HERE,

22:03.824 --> 22:05.200
AND I WAS MAKING A FEW
VISITS OUT THIS WAY.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.702
I THOUGHT I'D STOP
AND SAY HELLO.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.120
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU DID.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.707
GIVE ME AN EXCUSE
TO SIT DOWN
FOR A MINUTE.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.709
YOU GOT A THIRST?
IT'S COLD.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.544
NO. NO, THANK YOU.

22:15.711 --> 22:18.130
CHARLES, EVERY PLACE
I STOP, I'M OBLIGED
TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA,

22:18.296 --> 22:19.464
AND BY THE TIME
THE DAY'S OVER,

22:19.631 --> 22:20.632
I'M SLOSHING AROUND
LIKE A WATER TROUGH.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.426
[BOTH LAUGH]

22:24.928 --> 22:28.140
CHARLES, I SPOKE
TO NELS OLESON
THIS MORNING.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.266
OH.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.309
HE'S THE REAL REASON
I'M OUT HERE.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.894
HE WANTED TO
COME BY HIMSELF,

22:33.061 --> 22:34.563
BUT HE JUST COULDN'T
BRING HIMSELF TO DO IT.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.481
I UNDERSTAND.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.234
HE FEELS VERY BAD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED. HE ASKED
ME TO TELL YOU THAT.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.987
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH NELS.

22:42.154 --> 22:43.405
I DON'T HAVE ANY
GRUDGE AGAINST HIM.

22:43.572 --> 22:46.324
GOOD.
I'LL TELL HIM THAT.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.411
AND, CHARLES, TRY NOT
TO THINK TOO UNKINDLY
OF HIS WIFE.

22:49.578 --> 22:52.706
THERE'S GOOD
IN ALL PEOPLE.

22:52.873 --> 22:55.667
JUST A LITTLE BIT
HARDER TO FIND IN SOME.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.627
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN, REVEREND.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.838
AND WE'RE
DOING FINE.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.632
I THINK THE GOOD LORD
GIVES US HARD TIMES
NOW AND THEN

23:02.799 --> 23:04.301
JUST SO
WE CAN APPRECIATE
THE GOOD ONES.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.220
SOMETIMES
I THINK YOU MISSED
YOUR CALLING, CHARLES.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.764
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A MINISTER.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.515
COULDN'T HANDLE
IT, REVEREND.
I DON'T LIKE TEA.

23:10.682 --> 23:11.683
[BOTH LAUGH]

23:11.850 --> 23:13.602
WELL, I'LL LET YOU
GET BACK TO WORK.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.021
SAY HELLO
TO THE FAMILY FOR ME.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.482
I WILL.
SEE YOU SUNDAY.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.424
ALL DONE, HANS.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.884
Hans: OH,
THANK YOU,
CHARLES.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.761
HOW'S IT GOING
OVER AT MAKAY'S?

23:47.928 --> 23:49.554
I'M HEADING
BACK THERE NOW.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.807
I WOULDN'T
WANT TO TRADE
YOU JOBS.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.811
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.815
AAH'.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.944
GOOD DAY,
MRS. OLESON.

24:13.745 --> 24:14.996
CAROLINE, SUPPER
WAS DELICIOUS.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.748
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
ROOM FOR BERRIES.

24:16.915 --> 24:17.916
I PICKED A WHOLE
MESS OF THEM.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.585
I'VE ALWAYS GOT
ROOM FOR BERRIES.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.587
I WANT SUGAR
ON MINE.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.089
NOT TONIGHT,
DEAR.

24:24.256 --> 24:26.174
OH, LET HER HAVE
A LITTLE SUGAR.
IT WON'T HURT HER.

24:26.341 --> 24:27.634
THERE ISN'T
ANY MORE.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.137
[SIGHS]

24:30.303 --> 24:33.974
NO TEA, NO SUGAR.

24:34.141 --> 24:36.893
IT'S NOTHING
WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.603
IT'S NOT
THE DOING WITHOUT
THAT BOTHERS ME.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.773
IT'S HAVING TO--
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
WE'VE WORKED.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.191
EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH,

24:43.358 --> 24:45.443
I CAN'T EVEN GIVE YOU
A LITTLE TEA AND SUGAR.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.529
IT WON'T BE
FOR LONG.

24:47.696 --> 24:51.199
BESIDES, YOU ALWAYS
SAID SUGAR WAS BAD
FOR YOUR TEETH, PA.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.078
WELL, IF YOU'RE ALL
NOT COMPLAINING,
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T.

24:55.245 --> 24:58.623
OK, WE'LL
HAVE SOME BERRIES
AND A CUP OF COFFEE.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.668
HOW ABOUT
JUST SOME BERRIES?

25:03.962 --> 25:06.590
THAT WAS THE LAST
OF THE COFFEE
THIS MORNING.

25:06.756 --> 25:07.966
YOU ALWAYS SAID
TOO MUCH COFFEE

25:08.133 --> 25:09.301
MAKES IT HARD
FOR YOU TO SLEEP.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.179
IT'S TRUE. YOU DID
SAY THAT, PA.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.515
I DID SAY THAT.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.851
WELL, IF THE GOOD LORD
PROVIDED US WITH BERRIES
AND LAURA PICKED THEM,

25:18.018 --> 25:19.477
I THINK WE
OUGHT TO EAT THEM.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.772
BOWLS, PLEASE.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.347
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]

26:01.853 --> 26:03.230
LAURA.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.690
YES, MISS BEADLE?

26:05.857 --> 26:07.192
LAURA,
YOU DIDN'T TURN IN

26:07.359 --> 26:08.693
YOUR ASSIGNMENT
AGAIN TODAY.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.112
NOW, THAT'S
2 IN A ROW.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.197
I KNOW.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.865
BUT THAT'S NOT
LIKE YOU.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.533
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26:15.700 --> 26:18.828
IT--IT'S NOTHING.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.622
SIT DOWN, LAURA.

26:23.541 --> 26:26.044
NOW, WE'RE FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

26:26.211 --> 26:27.045
YEAH.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.546
WELL, WHEN YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM,

26:28.713 --> 26:29.965
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TELL A FRIEND,
SHOULDN'T YOU?

26:30.131 --> 26:32.676
YES, MA'AM.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.344
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

26:34.511 --> 26:39.224
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE
TABLET PAPER LEFT.

26:39.391 --> 26:42.769
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE ASSIGNMENTS,
HONEST,

26:42.936 --> 26:44.938
BUT I DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING
TO WRITE THEM ON.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.984
I SEE. WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.235
I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY OVER

26:50.402 --> 26:51.361
TO OLESON'S
MERCANTILE

26:51.528 --> 26:52.404
TO GET SOME MORE
TABLETS FOR SCHOOL.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.905
WHY DON'T I
JUST PICK UP

26:54.072 --> 26:55.407
2 EXTRA
FOR YOU AND MARY?

26:55.573 --> 26:57.867
OH, NO, MA'AM.
I COULDN'T LET
YOU DO THAT.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.995
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
I WASN'T THROUGH.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.289
IF I GET YOU
THE TABLETS,

27:02.455 --> 27:03.331
YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE ME

27:03.498 --> 27:04.833
YOU'LL GET ME
SOME CHALK...

27:05.000 --> 27:06.251
SOMEDAY
WHEN I NEED IT.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.419
PROMISE?

27:07.585 --> 27:10.672
I PROMISE.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.050
THAT'S
TOO HARD.

27:14.217 --> 27:15.969
IT WILL BE
HARDER NEXT TIME.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.637
OH, YEAH?

27:17.804 --> 27:18.888
HEY.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.182
LOOK
WHO'S COMING.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.287
MISS BEADLE?

27:42.454 --> 27:43.538
YES, LAURA?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.290
I'D JUST AS SOON
WAIT OUTSIDE,

27:45.457 --> 27:46.458
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.251
OF COURSE NOT.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.171
Both: HI, MISS BEADLE.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.922
HELLO.

28:01.431 --> 28:02.891
I WONDER WHY
LAURA INGALLS

28:03.058 --> 28:04.851
DOESN'T COME IN
THE STORE ANYMORE.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.312
BECAUSE SHE'S TOO POOR
TO BUY ANYTHING.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.813
THAT'S WHY.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.440
SO'S HER FATHER.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.359
HE CAN'T EVEN
PAY WHAT HE OWES
IN THE STORE.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.401
YEAH.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.987
CAN'T GET
A DECENT JOB, EITHER.

28:16.154 --> 28:19.449
ALL HE DOES IS DIG
IN THE MUD AND CLEAN UP
AFTER HORSES.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.326
MY PA
WORKS HARD'.

28:21.493 --> 28:22.452
SO DOES A MULE.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.788
YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.706
Nellie: I WILL NOT.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.792
MY MOTHER SAYS SHE'S
GLAD YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
COME IN THE STORE ANYMORE

28:28.958 --> 28:30.168
BECAUSE HE SMELLS BAD.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.836
HE SMELLS LIKE
A DIRTY STABLE.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.839
THAT'S ALL HE'S
GOOD FOR--CLEANING UP
AFTER HORSES.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.931
LAURA'.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.019
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH LAURA?

28:48.186 --> 28:49.396
I DON'T KNOW,
MISS BEADLE.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.022
WE JUST SAID HELLO,
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNEW,

28:51.189 --> 28:52.857
SHE JUST UP AND
RAN OFF. ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, WILLIE?

28:53.024 --> 28:54.901
YEAH.
SHE JUST UP
AND RAN OFF.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.529
WELL, WE HAVE TO
GET STARTED ON OUR
HOMEWORK, MISS BEADLE.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.406
BYE.

29:13.628 --> 29:14.879
Charles:
MISS BEADLE.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.297
MR. INGALLS.

29:16.464 --> 29:20.009
I'M SURPRISED YOU
RECOGNIZE ME WITH
MY DIRT SUIT ON.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.720
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

29:22.887 --> 29:24.180
I HOPE NOT.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.724
IT'S LAURA.

29:26.891 --> 29:30.895
SHE FAILED TO TURN IN
HER HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
FOR THE LAST 2 DAYS,

29:31.062 --> 29:32.147
AND WHEN I
ASKED HER WHY,

29:32.313 --> 29:33.773
SHE, UH...

29:33.940 --> 29:36.025
WELL, GO AHEAD.

29:38.278 --> 29:41.114
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY MORE WRITING TABLETS.

29:43.158 --> 29:45.076
WALNUT GROVE
IS A SMALL TOWN,
MR. INGALLS.

29:45.243 --> 29:46.703
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR PROBLEM,

29:46.870 --> 29:48.246
AND I DON'T
BLAME YOU A BIT.

29:48.413 --> 29:52.375
THAT'S WHY
I OFFERED LAURA SOME
TABLET PAPER, BUT...

29:52.542 --> 29:54.419
NOW, IT WAS JUST
A LOAN, MIND YOU.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.713
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISUNDERSTAND.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.132
I DON'T.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.758
THAT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU.

30:00.925 --> 30:04.721
WELL, I'M AFRAID
IT UPSET LAURA.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.598
SHE RAN AWAY BEFORE
I COULD GIVE HER
THE PAPER. I...

30:06.764 --> 30:08.725
[SIGHS]

30:08.892 --> 30:11.311
I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT I'M AFRAID
I HURT HER FEELINGS.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.687
AH, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE LAURA.

30:12.854 --> 30:13.938
SHE CARES
TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

30:14.105 --> 30:15.899
AND WE ALL KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT HER.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.443
I'M SURE IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.236
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:20.403 --> 30:21.738
I'M SURE I AM. WHY
DON'T YOU COME ON
DOWN TO THE HOUSE,

30:21.905 --> 30:23.448
HAVE SOME SUPPER
WITH US?

30:23.615 --> 30:27.285
OH, THANK YOU, BUT I
HAVE A STACK OF PAPERS
WAITING FOR ME AT HOME.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.745
GIVE MY BEST
TO MRS. INGALLS.

30:28.912 --> 30:29.787
I WILL.

30:29.954 --> 30:33.208
I, UH...

30:33.374 --> 30:37.670
I BROUGHT
THE TABLETS WITH ME.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.922
I'LL GIVE THEM
TO LAURA.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.548
THANK YOU.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.133
NO. THANK YOU.

30:42.300 --> 30:45.386
WE'RE ALL PRETTY LUCKY
HAVING YOU TEACHING
OUR CHILDREN.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.807
GIDDY UP, PAP.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.493
[LAURA CRYING SOFTLY]

31:31.224 --> 31:32.850
YOU WANT TO
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

31:33.017 --> 31:34.602
NO, SIR.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.569
MISS BEADLE
STOPPED BY.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.946
SHE WAS FEELING
KIND OF BAD.

31:45.113 --> 31:47.240
SHE WAS AFRAID SHE MIGHT
HAVE DONE SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.785
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.997
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU SEE A FRIEND
RUN OFF LIKE THAT,

31:54.163 --> 31:55.373
IT BOTHERS A PERSON.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.293
YOU GET TO THINKING
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

31:59.877 --> 32:02.380
YOU SURE IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH
MISS BEADLE?

32:02.547 --> 32:05.091
I'M SURE.

32:05.258 --> 32:07.677
WELL, SHE'LL BE
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.971
IT WAS NELLIE
AND WILLIE.

32:10.138 --> 32:13.057
THOSE TWO, HUH?

32:13.224 --> 32:14.809
YOU KIND OF
SURPRISE ME,
HALF-PINT.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.562
I FIGURED
YOU'D BE USED TO
THEIR TEASING BY NOW.

32:17.729 --> 32:18.980
I AM...

32:19.147 --> 32:21.566
WHEN IT'S ABOUT ME.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.236
AND THIS TIME
IT WASN'T?

32:28.740 --> 32:31.075
YOU GOING TO
TELL ME WHO
IT WAS ABOUT?

32:31.242 --> 32:32.619
NO.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.539
WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T WANT
TO TELL ANOTHER PERSON
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

32:36.706 --> 32:39.292
IT GENERALLY MEANS
THAT IT WAS ABOUT
THE OTHER PERSON.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.962
IT WAS ABOUT ME,
WASN'T IT?

32:46.174 --> 32:47.592
THEY SAID
AWFUL THINGS,

32:47.759 --> 32:49.552
DUMB THINGS.

32:49.719 --> 32:52.221
THEY SAID THAT
YOU COULDN'T GET
A DECENT JOB

32:52.388 --> 32:55.683
AND THAT ALL YOU
COULD DO WAS CLEAN UP
AFTER THE ANIMALS

32:55.850 --> 32:58.019
AND THAT YOU
SMELLED BAD.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.148
WELL...

33:02.315 --> 33:04.025
THEY WERE RIGHT
2 OUT OF 3.

33:04.192 --> 33:06.444
AND I DO CLEAN
THE STABLES.

33:06.611 --> 33:08.237
WHEN I COME HOME
FROM WORKING ALL DAY,

33:08.404 --> 33:12.158
I DON'T EXACTLY SMELL
LIKE A BOTTLE OF LEMON
VERBENA, NOW, DO I?

33:14.118 --> 33:15.620
WELL, DO I?

33:15.787 --> 33:16.579
NO.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.539
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.876
AND AS FOR
THE DECENT JOB, NOW,
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.836
ANY JOB A MAN CAN DO
TO MAKE HIS WAY
IN THIS WORLD

33:24.003 --> 33:28.758
IS A DECENT JOB AS LONG
AS HE WORKS HARD AT IT
AND DOES HIS BEST.

33:28.925 --> 33:32.470
YOU KNOW, GOD DIDN'T PUT
SWEAT IN A MAN'S BODY
FOR NO REASON.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.347
HE PUT IT THERE
SO HE COULD WORK HARD,

33:34.514 --> 33:37.642
CLEANSE HIMSELF,
AND FEEL PROUD.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.520
DON'T YOU EVER
FORGET THAT.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.189
HARD-WORKING FOLKS
ONLY SMELL BAD
TO SOME FOLKS

33:43.356 --> 33:47.568
WHO HAVE NOTHING
ELSE TO DO BUT STICK
THEIR NOSES IN THE AIR.

33:47.735 --> 33:50.905
I THINK YOU AND I
KNOW WHO THEY ARE,
DON'T WE?

33:52.907 --> 33:54.158
ALL RIGHT.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.244
HERE'S THOSE TABLETS
MISS BEADLE WANTED
YOU TO HAVE.

33:56.411 --> 33:58.413
YOU MAKE SURE
YOU USE THEM,
YOUNG LADY.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.164
I WILL.

34:06.838 --> 34:09.674
NOW, YOU KNOW THEY
SAY CLEANLINESS IS
NEXT TO GODLINESS,

34:09.841 --> 34:11.759
SO WHILE I'M DOWN
AT THE CREEK GETTING
A LITTLE CLOSER TO GOD,

34:11.926 --> 34:14.429
WHY DON'T YOU
GO IN THE HOUSE AND
HELP MA WITH SUPPER?

34:14.595 --> 34:15.471
I WILL.

34:15.638 --> 34:16.723
ALL RIGHT.

34:22.770 --> 34:23.604
PA?

34:23.771 --> 34:25.940
YEAH?

34:26.107 --> 34:28.776
I JUST LOVE YOU
SO MUCH.

34:47.211 --> 34:48.838
I'M SURE GLAD
IT'S FRIDAY.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.841
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO TO
SCHOOL ANYHOW.

34:52.008 --> 34:54.260
I'M THE ONE WHO
OUGHT TO BE GLAD
IT'S FRIDAY.

34:54.427 --> 34:56.679
FRIDAY'S THE DAY
I GET PAID. THAT'S WHY.

34:56.846 --> 34:58.514
HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK MRS. WHIPPLE
WILL GIVE YOU?

34:58.681 --> 35:01.851
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.
SHE PAYS ME BY HOW MUCH
WORK I GET DONE,

35:02.018 --> 35:05.772
BUT IT SHOULD BE
A LOT. I SEWED FAST
THE WHOLE WEEK.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.398
THINK SHE'LL
GIVE YOU A DOLLAR?

35:07.565 --> 35:09.233
MAYBE MORE.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.486
I WISH I COULD
WORK LIKE YOU.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.237
I COULDN'T DO IT
IF YOU WEREN'T
DOING MY CHORES

35:13.404 --> 35:15.823
AND GETTING
ALL MY HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENTS FOR ME.

35:15.990 --> 35:20.328
IN A WAY, HALF
THE MONEY I EARN
IS YOURS, REALLY.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.538
DO YOU MEAN THAT?

35:22.705 --> 35:23.998
SURE, I DO.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.374
SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

35:25.541 --> 35:26.793
SEE YOU.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.047
HEY, MARY'.

35:31.214 --> 35:32.548
Mary: YEAH?

35:32.715 --> 35:34.801
CAN I PUT
HALF THE MONEY
IN THE MONEY JAR

SO'S PA COULD SEE?

35:36.719 --> 35:37.845

THANKS. SEE YOU.

DON'T LET NELLIE
MAKE YOU UPSET.

35:41.557 --> 35:43.476
I WON'T'.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.171
LET'S PLAY
A NEW GAME.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.923
WHAT FOR?
THIS IS A FUN GAME.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.092
YEAH. AND I'M WINNING.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.344
BE QUIET, WILLIE.

36:18.511 --> 36:20.304
I'VE GOT
A BETTER GAME.

36:20.471 --> 36:21.472
Willie: WHAT?

36:21.639 --> 36:22.598
WE CAN PLAY HORSEY

36:22.765 --> 36:24.267
AND RIDE AROUND
THE SCHOOLYARD.

36:24.433 --> 36:27.103
Girl: THAT'S DUMB.
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE A HORSE.

36:27.270 --> 36:30.565
MAYBE WE CAN GET ONE.

36:30.731 --> 36:31.983
WHERE IS YOUR PA,
LAURA?

36:32.149 --> 36:33.985
HE SMELLS
LIKE A HORSE.

36:34.151 --> 36:37.405
WE COULD PRETEND
AND RIDE HIM.

36:37.572 --> 36:38.865
TAKE IT BACK,
NELLIE.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.491
I WON'T TAKE IT BACK.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.994
YOU CAN GO CRYING
TO MISS BEADLE, AND I
WON'T TAKE IT BACK.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.663
YEAH. WE WON'T
TAKE IT BACK.

36:46.664 --> 36:48.916

36:52.712 --> 36:54.881
I'M NOT CRYING
ANYMORE, NELLIE,

36:55.047 --> 36:57.008
AND YOU BETTER
TAKE IT BACK.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.176
I WON'T TAKE IT BACK
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

36:59.343 --> 37:02.054
YOUR PA SMELLS LIKE
A DUMB OLD HORSE.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.182
I TAKE IT BACK.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.229
HARD-WORKING FOLKS
ONLY SMELL BAD TO FOLKS

37:10.396 --> 37:12.899
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO
BUT STICK THEIR NOSES
IN THE AIR.

37:13.065 --> 37:16.235
WELL, WHENEVER YOU STICK
YOUR NOSE IN THE AIR
WITH ME, NELLIE,

37:16.402 --> 37:17.987
IT'S GOING TO
GET PUNCHED.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.045

37:34.211 --> 37:35.087
YES, LAURA?

37:35.254 --> 37:36.255
I WANT TO THANK YOU
ABOUT THE TABLETS.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.757
OH, WELL, YOU'RE
VERY WELCOME.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.343
AND ABOUT YESTERDAY,
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.970
AND DON'T WORRY.
IT WON'T EVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.

37:46.682 --> 37:47.558

38:01.072 --> 38:02.657
OH, MAKAY.

38:02.823 --> 38:04.533
IT'S COMING ALONG.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.203
YEAH. I CAN
SEE THAT. HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE CIDER?

38:07.370 --> 38:10.414
NO, THANK YOU.
I WANT TO KEEP MOVING
AS FAST AS I CAN.

38:10.581 --> 38:12.416
WELL, I...

38:12.583 --> 38:13.876
I DON'T THINK
IT'S FAST ENOUGH.

38:14.043 --> 38:16.587
YOU KNOW, WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME UP
WITH THIS IDEA,

38:16.754 --> 38:18.255
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
COULD MAKE IT WORK.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.925
THAT'S WHY I KIND OF
SAT BACK AND WAITED.

38:21.092 --> 38:23.010
YEAH, WELL, I CAN
DO IT. BELIEVE ME.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.763
OH, I DO.
I BELIEVE THAT.

38:25.930 --> 38:28.224
BUT I THINK IF WE...
IF WE WORK TOGETHER,

38:28.391 --> 38:31.060
WE COULD GET IT
DONE A LOT FASTER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:33.354 --> 38:37.191
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BOTH
HAVE A SIP OF CIDER
AND GO TO WORK.

38:49.704 --> 38:51.664

MRS. CARTER'S SKIRT.

38:51.831 --> 38:53.874

38:54.041 --> 38:56.627
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH A FAST WORKER.

OH'. AND PERFECT
WORK, TOO'.

38:59.797 --> 39:00.923

DO YOUR BEST WORK,

39:01.090 --> 39:02.425
AND THE TIME WILL
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.635
WELL, YOU'VE
CERTAINLY LEARNED
THAT LESSON WELL.

39:04.802 --> 39:05.636
I'LL START
ON THE DRESS.

39:05.803 --> 39:07.263
NOW, HOLD ON.
JUST A MINUTE.

39:07.430 --> 39:10.141

EVEN SUPPOSED TO
FINISH THIS TODAY,

39:10.307 --> 39:12.351
MUCH LESS START
ANOTHER GARMENT.

39:12.518 --> 39:13.477
I KNOW, BUT--

39:13.644 --> 39:15.062
THERE ARE NO BUTS
ABOUT IT.

39:15.229 --> 39:18.524
IT'S 4:00.
SCHOOL IS JUST
GETTING OUT.

39:18.691 --> 39:20.693

39:20.860 --> 39:22.319
WITH LAURA
FOR A CHANGE?

39:22.486 --> 39:24.321
I CAN GET
THE DRESS STARTED.

39:24.488 --> 39:27.908
MARY, YOU MUSTN'T
ARGUE WITH OLD PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEM.

39:28.075 --> 39:30.578
ANYWAY, YOU CAN'T WIN.
SO RUN ALONG,

39:30.745 --> 39:32.163

YOU FOR THE WEEK.

THING THAT'S WRONG
WITH OLD PEOPLE.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.096
EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE,

40:30.262 --> 40:32.723
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP
REMINDING THEM

DAYLIGHT LEFT.

LOOK AT YOU.

DIRTY, YOUR HAIR

A MAN EVER SET
HIS EYES ON.

THE ONLY THING
I REGRET ABOUT
BEING MARRIED TO YOU

42:24.168 --> 42:27.421
IS THAT I WON'T HAVE
THE JOY OF ASKING YOU
TO BE MY WIFE AGAIN.

44:06.145 --> 44:08.647
ENOUGH TO PAY
THE BILL AT THE OLESON'S
WITH SOME TO SPARE.
