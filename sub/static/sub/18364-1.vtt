my feet for,

02:35.755 --> 02:36.779

02:36.856 --> 02:39.086
- Oh, so that's why you can't
work right now?

02:40.126 --> 02:43.027
You get paid to dance,

02:43.096 --> 02:44.256

he could have said USC.

to a story

04:22.428 --> 04:24.487
that we have been following
for the past several days.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.725
The greater Los Angeles area

04:26.799 --> 04:29.632
has been plagued with a rash
of kidnappings

04:29.702 --> 04:33.297
with as many as four victims
disappearing in separate attacks

04:33.373 --> 04:35.841
and all possibly by the same
masked individual.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.934
Now, a source inside the LAPD
refuses to say

04:39.012 --> 04:40.411
whether or not there is
a connection

04:40.480 --> 04:42.175
between the kidnapped victims.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.476
- l'll take the check.

04:43.549 --> 04:46.985
- A detective with
the West Los Angeles division

has also fallen prey
to this masked criminal.

than the cops do.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.644
Jackson got nabbed,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.347
and they think it might
be linked to a priest

06:29.422 --> 06:31.014
who got nabbed in the valley
on Thursday.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.024
And then l got a report across
my desk this morning

06:33.092 --> 06:34.389
about a kidnapping in Barstow,

06:34.460 --> 06:36.291
and they like Jackson's guy
for that too.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.727
l don't know.

06:37.797 --> 06:38.786

in the state

not practical,

to figure it out,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.897

something.

11:13.973 --> 11:14.940
What did you do?

11:16.308 --> 11:17.798
- Don't look at me, bitch.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.261
so there has to be something.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.390
- Well, l'll be the first
to admit

11:41.467 --> 11:43.526
that l have
a pretty messed-up history,

11:43.602 --> 11:44.728
but l don't know
who that guy is

11:44.804 --> 11:46.567
or why l'm here.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.970
- And l'll be the last
to admit shit.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.098
To hell with that guy.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.472
He's a punk,

11:50.543 --> 11:51.976
and my money says
that he's a cop.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.102
- What?

11:53.179 --> 11:54.146
- You're insane.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.737
The punk-ass pig

11:55.815 --> 11:57.407
puts a bunch of criminals
in one room.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.882
All right?

11:58.951 --> 12:03.820
Gets them all scared and crowing
about the shit that they did.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.413
The cops write up a list
and bust us all.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.549
l'm not saying shit.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.083
- This is not a setup
by the cops.

12:10.162 --> 12:13.427
- l had a friend
a couple years ago,

12:13.499 --> 12:15.865
got in a barroom fight
with a guy.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.130
Guy turns out to be a cop.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.071
A couple hours later,
he's in room like this.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.372
They threw him a hell
of a blanket party.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.878
The guy never did
walk the same since.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.505
- lt's not the cops.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.607
- How can you be so sure?

12:31.684 --> 12:34.050
- Because l'm
a fucking genius, okay?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.485
- Yeah, well,
anything is possible.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.250
- l had a customer
a couple of weeks ago

12:38.324 --> 12:39.291
threaten to kill me

12:39.358 --> 12:40.689
when l cut him off at the bar.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.621
But then he drove his car
into a building.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.024
- Maybe this is all just
a mistake.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.265
- What, do you think he
kidnapped all of us by mistake?

12:53.339 --> 12:54.601
Look, he's obviously crazy,

12:54.673 --> 12:57.164
so that's something we can
use to our advantage.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.302
- Are we supposed to think
of a crime that's so horrible

12:59.378 --> 13:01.039
that he would kill nine people
as a result,

13:01.113 --> 13:03.047
some horrible crime that we did?

13:10.022 --> 13:11.353
- l'm sorry, Father,

13:11.423 --> 13:13.983
but the worst
thing one person

13:14.059 --> 13:15.686
can do to another

13:15.761 --> 13:18.753
is child molestation.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.163
- Never.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.860
l never would do such a thing.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.098
- l have.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.001
- Was it, like, boys or girls?

13:31.076 --> 13:33.510
- Does it matter to you?

13:33.579 --> 13:36.047
- No, no.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.082
- Me neither.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.673
[chuckles]

13:38.751 --> 13:39.775
- Oh, you sick son of a bitch.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.080
- You put me in a room
with you

13:41.153 --> 13:42.518
and no windows and no doors,

13:42.588 --> 13:44.556
and you're gonna wish
that you were never born.

13:44.623 --> 13:49.617
- Sweetie, we are in a room
with no windows or doors,

13:49.695 --> 13:52.528
and the only thing you're gonna
do is try to survive,

13:52.598 --> 13:53.656
just like me.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.199
- Maybe you deserve to die.

13:55.267 --> 13:59.033
- What l've done might have
gotten me here,

13:59.104 --> 14:02.096
but you two

14:02.174 --> 14:04.039
and all of you...

14:06.178 --> 14:07.577
What have all of you done

14:07.646 --> 14:10.240
to deserve
the death penalty?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.147
Hmm?

14:18.224 --> 14:19.714
- My name is Eddie Vigoda.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.885
- Hi, Eddie.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.866
- Maybe that helps somebody.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.366
- No, Eddie.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.494
No, it doesn't.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.946
[clock ticking]

14:58.330 --> 15:00.798
l'm Dean Jackson.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.292
- l'm Kelley Murphy.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.428
l'm an assistant
district attorney

15:05.504 --> 15:08.473
for Los Angeles County.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.269
- Can you think of anyone
you've put away

15:10.342 --> 15:13.106
that would want revenge,
like a crazed killer,

15:13.178 --> 15:15.874
you know, some escaped psycho?

15:15.948 --> 15:17.279
- Take your pick.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.078
l mean, l've made more
than a few enemies,

15:19.151 --> 15:20.880
but there are people that keep
tabs on parolees

15:20.953 --> 15:22.648
that might come after me.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.279
And no one saw this guy coming.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.351
Jackson, anything you'd
like to add?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.122
- Huh?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.331
- l know you.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.960
- Says you.

15:37.036 --> 15:40.665
- We did some business together
years ago.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.604
l'm sure it was small-time stuff
for you,

15:42.675 --> 15:44.370
but it was pretty big for me.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.640
My name
is Christian Collinsworth.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.044
- What kind of business
are you in?

15:49.114 --> 15:51.514
- Sully's with the mob.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.483
You know, it doesn't surprise me
that you don't remember me.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.543
lt's been a long time.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.146
- What's your name, anyway, man?

15:58.223 --> 16:01.590
- Sully Fenton from Vegas.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.992
- What kind of business
did you two do together?

16:04.063 --> 16:05.030
- Ask the kid.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.291
Hell if l know.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.360
- A deal came my way,
some pharmaceutical-grade speed.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.366
l was about five grand short,
so l went to Sully.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.500
l heard he was in the business
of loaning money for drugs

16:17.576 --> 16:19.009
for part of the product
and profits.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.876
- l'm sure five grand sounded
pretty sweet to me at the time,

16:21.947 --> 16:22.936
especially selling meth.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.483
- So what happened?

16:25.551 --> 16:27.781
- l sold the stuff
to these two cool guys

16:27.853 --> 16:30.913
who turned out to be
undercover cops.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.855
And l went in for three years.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.517
- But you still paid me, right?

16:34.593 --> 16:36.823
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.420
Everybody knows what happens
when you don't pay Sully Fenton.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.465
l'm not stupid.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.159
- Are you sure about that?

16:42.234 --> 16:46.227
- l had nothing going
into prison.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.465
l had even less getting out.

16:47.539 --> 16:50.565
But l got what l needed

16:50.642 --> 16:52.542
as soon as l hit the streets
in May.

16:52.611 --> 16:55.580
You were paid
by the end of the month.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.615
Now l'm an actor and bartender
in Hollywood though.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.480
- Good for you.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.780
- l'm gonna miss
my sitcom audition.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.618
- Your audition?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.021
Where the hell do you think
you are?

17:07.092 --> 17:09.617
- Jesus, will you
cut the kid some slack already?

17:09.694 --> 17:10.684
- We're all scared here.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.094
He's doing his best.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.961
- [sighs]

17:14.032 --> 17:18.128
- Hey, is Sully the only one
who's not from Los Angeles?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.932
- Uh-uh.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.700
My travels have
taken me all over,

17:21.773 --> 17:24.106
including Los Angeles.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.166
More than a few prisons.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.742
- l'm Father Michael Francis.

17:29.815 --> 17:34.548
l have Catholic parish
in the San Fernando Valley.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.145
- Eddie, where are you from?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.252
- Barstow.

17:40.325 --> 17:43.089
- You guys forgot about me.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.595
- You said you ain't talking.

17:44.663 --> 17:46.221
l just figured you're
from Los Angeles,

17:46.298 --> 17:48.129
since, you know,
the city's chock-full

17:48.200 --> 17:49.599
of you pussies.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.660
- l got your pussy.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.763
- [laughs]

17:54.840 --> 17:56.501
- Excuse me.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.769
Excuse me.

17:57.843 --> 18:03.179
No one appreciates your
pissing match more than l.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.944
But l think we're forgetting
about someone.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.521
- Do you speak English?

18:10.589 --> 18:11.578
English?

18:11.657 --> 18:13.852
- Say something.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.655
l know you understand us.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.696
- [speaking foreign language]

18:22.501 --> 18:24.230
- Does anybody know
what this language is?

18:24.303 --> 18:25.270
Anyone know what it is?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.304
- Chinese, l think.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.338
- How the hell do you know?

18:27.406 --> 18:28.805
- Old-school kung fu flicks.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.468
- lt's annoying, whatever it is.

18:31.543 --> 18:32.510
l hope he cap her ass first.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.945
[imitating foreign language]

18:36.014 --> 18:37.106
- [speaking foreign language]

18:37.182 --> 18:38.149
Nigger!

18:38.217 --> 18:42.711
- [laughs]

18:42.788 --> 18:45.222
The chick does speak English.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.450
- Yeah, she's funny.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.549
- [laughing]

18:47.626 --> 18:51.562
- Let's see who lives
and dies first.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.702
[clock ticking]

19:04.476 --> 19:07.502
- This situation stinks
of a pig setup.

19:07.579 --> 19:08.546
- Jesus.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.581
- Told you.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.945
- God, for the last time.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.177
This has absolutely nothing
to do with the cops.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.219
- How can you be so sure?

19:14.286 --> 19:15.617
- Because l am a cop!

19:15.687 --> 19:16.654
- l knew it.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.950
l knew it.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.082
- l thought if l told you
scumbags l was L.A. County,

19:20.159 --> 19:21.251
you wouldn't say anything,

19:21.326 --> 19:22.588
knowing l was one
of the good guys.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.754
- Good guys?
- Yeah.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.263
- You're one of the good guys?
- Yeah.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.562
- ln my old neighborhood,
the cops weren't the good guys.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.703
- l'm not a scumbag.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.707
- l'll make you a bet

19:39.778 --> 19:42.838
that our masked host
comes back in here,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.746
grabs one of us,
brings him outside,

19:44.816 --> 19:49.719
shoots the gun up into the air,
and we all think he's dead.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.255
- Yeah, that's what
he's gonna do.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.416
He's gonna sweat us.
That's what he's gonna do.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.459
- You think?

19:54.526 --> 19:55.550
- Yeah, he's gonna do that.

19:55.627 --> 19:56.594
- Really?

19:56.662 --> 19:58.425
- Come on, guys, come on.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.759
We can do this.

19:59.831 --> 20:00.798
Yeah.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.924
lf he figured out

20:02.000 --> 20:03.968
why we're all here,
we can figure it out.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.697
- You know what?

20:05.771 --> 20:09.935
l really appreciate
your can-do spirit,

20:10.008 --> 20:11.635
but if this pig is wrong,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.702
my name's Coogan.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.441
And l got to say,

20:16.515 --> 20:18.380
what a pleasure it was

20:18.450 --> 20:22.887
to spend the last ten minutes
of my life with you all.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.752
- Well, we still haven't
gotten your name.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.121
- You didn't?

20:27.192 --> 20:28.716
Miss chink over there said it
plain as day.

20:28.794 --> 20:32.787
lt's what you
and everyone else think: nigger.

20:32.864 --> 20:33.956
All right?

20:34.032 --> 20:36.296
- Yeah, is that
with one G or two?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.734
- Oh, that-that-

20:38.804 --> 20:39.930
[laughter]

20:40.005 --> 20:41.996
With two.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.304
- You think this is funny?

20:44.376 --> 20:45.673
This isn't funny.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.268
- Hey, what else am l gonna do?

20:47.346 --> 20:49.109
ln about three seconds
we're gonna find out

20:49.181 --> 20:52.582
if Coogan's right about this
being a bust,

20:52.651 --> 20:54.278
or we're gonna find
one of us dead.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.560
[door clicking]

21:08.834 --> 21:09.801
- Why are you here?

21:09.868 --> 21:11.631
- You got to give us more time.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.570
You're asking the impossible.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.232
We're all willing to do
whatever you want.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.900
But you have to give us
something in return.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.945
[gun clicks]

21:24.950 --> 21:26.144
- Okay, okay, okay.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.550
Okay, okay.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.487
How could l have known that?

21:35.527 --> 21:36.585
Please just wait a second.

21:36.662 --> 21:37.629
Please don't!

21:37.696 --> 21:38.663
[gunshot]

21:38.730 --> 21:41.699
- [screaming]

21:49.908 --> 21:50.966
- What are you doing, man?

21:51.043 --> 21:53.307
God!

21:53.378 --> 21:56.347
[woman crying]

21:58.617 --> 22:01.586
- [laughs]

22:05.691 --> 22:08.626
Fuck.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.499
Sorry to see him go,

22:16.568 --> 22:21.301
but that's one less
to worry about, right?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.806
- As l said,

22:22.874 --> 22:26.776
you have to know why l brought
each and every one of you here

22:26.845 --> 22:28.972
in order to survive.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.844
lf you want to walk
out of here alive,

22:30.916 --> 22:33.885
you'd better figure out
why he was here as well.

22:35.754 --> 22:36.988
[door slams]

22:36.988 --> 22:38.717
[door slams]

22:46.565 --> 22:48.192
- l can't die like this.

22:48.266 --> 22:49.233
- Please, God.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.268
We ask that you-

22:50.335 --> 22:52.769
[muttering]

22:52.838 --> 22:54.271
- Hey, Father.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.398
You think we can toss the idea

22:56.475 --> 23:00.935
of him faking the killing
outside the door?

23:01.012 --> 23:03.913
Who are you praying to?

23:03.982 --> 23:07.748
God's not here.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.081
- [muttering]

23:09.154 --> 23:11.281
- You still think
this is the cops?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.688
lf we don't figure out
what's going on

23:13.759 --> 23:15.158
before somebody else dies,

23:15.227 --> 23:16.785
we're not gonna get
out of here alive.

23:16.862 --> 23:21.196
- Well, does anybody here
speak Chinese?

23:21.266 --> 23:22.233
- l speak a little Spanish.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.564
- <i>Habla español?</i>

23:24.636 --> 23:27.730
- [speaking foreign language]

23:27.806 --> 23:28.773
- Really?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.001
Oh, oh.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.100
No dice.

23:34.479 --> 23:37.846
- Padre, you sure you didn't
touch no kids?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.976
- l have never harmed a child
in my life.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.952
Anyway, that thing over there,

23:43.021 --> 23:44.386
he's already admitted
to the crime,

23:44.456 --> 23:45.480
so stop looking at me.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.218
- Hey.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.987
Guys, l might be a little
screwed up,

23:49.060 --> 23:50.721
but l just spent
five years in jail.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.296
l'm trying to be a reformed man.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.427
- What did you serve time for?

23:58.503 --> 23:59.868
- Grand theft auto.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.132
- Not child molestation?

24:01.206 --> 24:03.367
- No, that's all they could
hit me with.

24:04.776 --> 24:08.542
You see,
they couldn't find a body.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.510
- Wow, you're a winner,
ain't you?

24:11.583 --> 24:12.845
- Thank you.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.521
- Piece of shit.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.851
- l think it's about time
we heard from you.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.122
- All right.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.793
l'm Leon, from L.A.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.961
My brother and l used to do work
up and down the West Coast.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.198
- What kind of work did you do?

24:52.724 --> 24:55.124
- Looking for this?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.763
Don't give me those
fucked-up looks.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.860
At least l never sexed
and killed no kids.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.632
l never killed anybody.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.038
But l'd rob your ass
if the price was right.

25:10.108 --> 25:12.702
Cash is king,
and l stick to what works.

25:12.777 --> 25:14.574
But guns?

25:14.646 --> 25:17.547
Guns can be better
than cash.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.584
- Kelley, did you ever
prosecute Leon?

25:19.651 --> 25:21.414
- No, he doesn't look familiar.

25:21.486 --> 25:22.851
- That's because
l never got caught.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.650
- Yeah, well, our friend
out there caught you.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.850
- Yeah, coming out the USC
library no less.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.222
- The library?

25:28.293 --> 25:31.228
- Yeah, it pays to do research
in my business.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.628
- lf the cop and Kelley
know each other

25:34.699 --> 25:38.294
and Christian and Vegas Sully
know each other,

25:38.370 --> 25:43.740
then it would make sense
that we're all connected here,

25:43.808 --> 25:45.742
whether we know it or not.

25:47.846 --> 25:48.813
- Well, if l busted you,

25:48.880 --> 25:50.177
you guys would know
better than me.

25:50.248 --> 25:51.215
l mean, that list is long.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.307
- Yeah, l'm in the same boat.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.942
l wouldn't even know
where to begin.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.452
But in my business,

25:55.520 --> 25:57.647
we don't do this shit.

25:57.722 --> 25:58.711
- l forget how you people

25:58.790 --> 26:00.121
can be so thoughtless
and careless

26:00.191 --> 26:01.556
when it comes to human life.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.924
l spend every waking moment
serving God

26:03.995 --> 26:06.327
by trying to help people
in my community,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.457
and all you seem to do
is try to destroy life.

26:08.533 --> 26:11.058
- You put yourself
up on a pedestal,

26:11.136 --> 26:12.330
but you're here
just like the rest of us.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.201
So why don't you stop talking
about why you shouldn't be here,

26:14.272 --> 26:15.500
and let's figure out
why you are.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.700
- Hey, Eddie.

26:17.842 --> 26:19.332
Eddie.
- What?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.140
- Nobody's stopping you
from talking, Eddie.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.043
- l work for
a health insurance carrier.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.081
l'm from Barstow.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.673
- That's fascinating.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.275
Any other useless facts
you'd like to pass around?

26:28.353 --> 26:29.377
- l'm doing my best.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.046
- Tell us about your work.

26:31.122 --> 26:32.749
What do you do?

26:32.824 --> 26:34.792
Come on, what do you do, Eddie?

26:34.859 --> 26:36.121
- Okay.

26:36.194 --> 26:37.491
[sighs]

26:37.562 --> 26:40.861
A couple of years ago,
l helped out my brother-in-law.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.331
He has colon cancer.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.801
My company does a lot
of experimental medical work,

26:45.870 --> 26:48.634
and l falsified his forms

26:48.707 --> 26:51.141
so that he can get
the treatment.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.804
But l did it to help
my brother-in-law.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.813
l mean, this doesn't make sense.

26:56.881 --> 26:58.314
l'm a good person.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.645
l don't deserve to be here.

26:59.718 --> 27:00.980
l shouldn't be here.

27:01.052 --> 27:02.178
- Hey!

27:02.253 --> 27:04.551
Relax there, leaky faucet.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.826
- Okay.

27:09.894 --> 27:10.861
l'm human.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.328
- Jesus Christ, Eddie.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.864
- So you know, l mean,
all right.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.092
Everybody have a look.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.997
You know, laugh.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.035
But you know what?

27:20.505 --> 27:23.668
lf we don't start confessing,

27:23.742 --> 27:25.642
l mean,

27:25.710 --> 27:27.644
we're never gonna
make it out of here alive.

27:27.712 --> 27:32.206
Everybody-
everybody's got to help.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.818
- Jackson and l
used to sleep together.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.049
- Ooh.

27:39.124 --> 27:41.058
- Yeah, until my wife found out.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.060
- Would your wife go this far

27:43.128 --> 27:44.561
to get back at you
for cheating on her?

27:44.629 --> 27:46.563
- No, she divorced me
and moved to Arizona.

27:46.631 --> 27:47.893
l think that's far enough.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.161
Plus, she has no way of getting
us all here together.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.202
And she has no reason to.

27:51.269 --> 27:53.032
l pay my alimony.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.128
l don't think
she hates me that much.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.866
- No ex-wife would want
her man dead.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.407
That's her money train.

27:57.475 --> 28:02.640
- Look, no one knows you two,
so l doubt it's the ex-wife.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.740
- And nobody really wants
to hear about your sex life.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.182
- Yeah, well,
she's just pissed off,

28:07.252 --> 28:08.480
'cause we got caught.

28:08.553 --> 28:09.713
- Yeah, it was your
big mouth that got us caught.

28:09.788 --> 28:10.755
- You know what, Kelley?

28:10.822 --> 28:11.789
You're not the only one
who got hurt.

28:11.856 --> 28:12.823
l lost my wife.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.756
- Yeah, and l was labeled
the home-wrecking slut.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.259
That did wonders for my career.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.557
- And l wasn't the only person
you were screwing around with.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.098
What was it, a month before
some judge knocked you up?

28:22.333 --> 28:23.630
- Hey, kitty cats.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.569
Why so hostile?

28:26.638 --> 28:27.935
An affair is an affair.

28:28.006 --> 28:30.668
- Now we're getting relationship
advice from a pedophile.

28:30.742 --> 28:31.709
- Mm.

28:31.776 --> 28:34.643
[kissing noise]

28:41.352 --> 28:44.321
[clock ticking]

29:16.087 --> 29:17.816
- What the fuck
you looking at?

29:23.495 --> 29:25.292
- You one tall drink of water.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.024
- Oh, you're turning faggot now?

29:27.098 --> 29:30.659
- No, l just realized
how l'm getting out of here.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.904
None of you guys are gonna
come up with shit.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.499
Closest one to me.

29:37.575 --> 29:39.008
- What are you doing?

29:39.077 --> 29:40.772
- So start kicking.

29:40.845 --> 29:42.107
- You are crazy, man.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.306
- You got a better idea?

29:43.381 --> 29:44.643
Break my hand
so l can get out these cuffs.

29:44.716 --> 29:47.048
- You're crazy.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.642
- l'm not kidding.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.778
Start kicking, man.

29:49.854 --> 29:50.821
- All right.

29:50.889 --> 29:52.356
My pleasure.

29:55.026 --> 29:55.993
[laughs]

29:56.060 --> 29:57.027
- Come on, game it up.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.062
- l'll get it.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.098
- [screaming]

30:08.573 --> 30:09.540
- Wait!
- Come on!

30:09.607 --> 30:10.699
Stop.

30:10.775 --> 30:12.504
- Wait, l almost got it.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.544
Oh, come on.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.340
One more, one more.

30:15.413 --> 30:16.380
Just do it.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.506
- [laughs]

30:18.583 --> 30:19.550
- [screaming]

30:19.617 --> 30:21.346
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.910
All right, all right.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.957
[screaming]

30:30.862 --> 30:31.829
[cracking]

30:31.896 --> 30:33.557
[screaming]

30:33.631 --> 30:34.757
- Leon, Leon, get up.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.925
Hey, get behind the door.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.831
And when he comes in,
you push him in,

30:37.902 --> 30:38.869
and we'll attack him.

30:38.937 --> 30:39.904
- Yeah, bring him my way.

30:39.971 --> 30:41.063
- Leon, get behind the door.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.163
Come on.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.764
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.969
- But l got a better one.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.011
Later.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.409
- Oh, you can't leave us.

30:48.479 --> 30:53.314
Bitch, you think l give a damn
about you?

30:53.384 --> 30:54.681
To hell with you.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.379
- Leon, you can't
leave us in here like this.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.012
- [speaking foreign language]

30:58.089 --> 30:59.716
- You stupid piece of shit!

30:59.791 --> 31:00.917
- Don't do it.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.823
You know you can't
leave us in here.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.361
- Don't leave us here.

31:04.429 --> 31:08.195
- Damn it!

31:08.266 --> 31:11.235
[clock ticking]

31:41.199 --> 31:43.667
- Oh, fuck!

31:43.735 --> 31:46.135
[both grunting]

31:47.205 --> 31:48.433
Punk-ass bitch.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.564
Huh?

31:49.641 --> 31:51.131
[shouting]

31:51.209 --> 31:53.677
You stupid fucking bitch.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.474
The thoughts that's been going
through my mind

31:55.546 --> 31:57.878
while l was in
that fucked-up room.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.509
And that's a fucked-up room!

32:00.585 --> 32:02.746
Now that l got this gun,

32:02.820 --> 32:04.981
the shit that l got
in store for you.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.250
[laughs]

32:06.324 --> 32:08.884
- l have been planning this
for two years.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.326
Nothing is gonna take away
what l have in store for you

32:11.396 --> 32:12.363
and the others.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.988
And l mean nothing.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.829
Before l enter,
l place one bullet

32:16.901 --> 32:19.165
into that gun you hold.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.933
But this gun?

32:22.006 --> 32:22.973
This gun holds six.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.942
[gun clicking]

32:26.010 --> 32:27.637
- Fuck.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.750
[screaming]

32:35.253 --> 32:38.689
- He didn't make it.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.726
- [grunting]

32:51.002 --> 32:53.971
[moaning]

33:14.292 --> 33:16.419
- Why are you here?

33:18.129 --> 33:19.756
- [groaning]

33:29.440 --> 33:32.204
- Maybe you should move them
out of the way of the splatter.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.141
l'd hate to see somebody die

33:34.212 --> 33:36.612
before you get a chance
to kill 'em yourself.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.718
Yeah.

33:44.789 --> 33:46.051
That's a good reason.

33:49.794 --> 33:50.761
[gunshot]

33:50.828 --> 33:51.954
[woman screams]

33:53.431 --> 33:56.264
- God, please.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.394
You don't have to do this.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.620
- Up until now,
the order has been random.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.889
l just want you to know
that you're next.

34:26.964 --> 34:29.933

34:44.949 --> 34:45.916
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.246
The Lord is with thee.

34:48.319 --> 34:51.344
Blessed art thou-

34:51.422 --> 34:54.482
Blessed art thou amongst women.

34:54.559 --> 34:57.255
l can't remember
the prayer either.

34:57.328 --> 34:59.319
l used to know it.

34:59.397 --> 35:03.629
l've said it like
a million times.

35:03.701 --> 35:04.725
Can you help me, Father?

35:05.870 --> 35:06.837
What?

35:06.904 --> 35:08.599
What's wrong?

35:08.673 --> 35:10.641
- l don't know.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.905
l can't remember,
but it's so familiar.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.309
- Oh, look.

35:15.379 --> 35:18.542
We got another ten minutes.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.312
lt can take me that long
to find my keys in the morning.

35:21.385 --> 35:24.354
- [laughing]

35:28.426 --> 35:31.987
- You finding something
funny there, bleeding boy?

35:32.063 --> 35:35.157

35:35.233 --> 35:38.862
l'm gonna die
like the man said,

35:38.936 --> 35:40.597
and you guys are gonna
die with me.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.235
l got eight minutes to live.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.335
And l've been thinking
about you bitches.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.745
l got to make peace.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.980
l got to make peace.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.113
- Look, if you're gonna die
a happy man,

35:59.190 --> 36:02.353
then l'm gonna die a happy man
laughing at your misery.

36:02.426 --> 36:05.657
- Look, we know Leon's
next to go.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.994
That means we have eight minutes
to figure out why he was here

36:08.065 --> 36:11.523
and another ten minutes
before somebody else dies.

36:11.602 --> 36:12.899
- Come on,
we can figure this out.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.301
Let's put our heads together,
guys.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.703
Come on, we can do this.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.910
- [speaking foreign language]

36:29.487 --> 36:32.081
- Something turned the slant on.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.384

if you watch it right.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.024
- [speaking foreign language]

36:41.098 --> 36:43.532
- Pictionary?

36:43.601 --> 36:44.863
- Glasses?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.028
Glasses.

36:46.103 --> 36:47.502
- l haven't worn glasses
in years.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.870
- l remember when
you wore glasses.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.876
This lady knows you,
or she did know you.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.138
- Bang, bang!

36:54.212 --> 36:55.179
- A shooting?

36:55.246 --> 36:56.474
Some kind of shooting,
a shooting?

36:56.547 --> 36:57.946
- Robbery?
- Bang!

36:58.015 --> 36:59.039
- Robbery!

36:59.116 --> 37:00.583
- Mrs. Chan?

37:00.651 --> 37:03.586
- Chan, Chan!

37:03.654 --> 37:06.623
[no audio]

37:08.092 --> 37:11.550

37:11.629 --> 37:14.462
- [speaking foreign language]

37:14.532 --> 37:16.466
- Did you get the guy
who robbed her?

37:16.534 --> 37:18.001
- Yeah, Chan picked him out
of a lineup.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.036
l prosecuted.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.468
He went to San Quentin.

37:20.538 --> 37:23.063
- What was this guy's name?

37:23.140 --> 37:27.099
- Greeley, Wade Greeley.

37:27.178 --> 37:30.545
He was a total punk kid,
20 years old.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.606
A total loser.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.650
- So that's it?

37:33.718 --> 37:34.685
That's why we're here?

37:34.752 --> 37:37.516
Because this kid Wade Greeley

37:37.588 --> 37:39.613
is pissed off that you sent him
to prison?

37:39.690 --> 37:43.490
- All we have here
is a robbery and a name

37:43.561 --> 37:47.053
and a whole hell of a lot
of unanswered questions.

37:47.131 --> 37:49.122
Okay, l don't even remember
busting this guy,

37:49.200 --> 37:50.167
Wade Greeley.

37:50.234 --> 37:51.360
- What about you, Father?

37:51.435 --> 37:53.130
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

37:54.839 --> 37:55.806
- l'm sorry.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.363
l can't help you.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.033
- Okay, if Wade Greeley

37:59.110 --> 38:01.271
going to jail
is the end-all-be-all,

38:01.345 --> 38:04.178
then we must fit in to this
before that happened.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.216
- l think l've got us
a time line.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.483
- You know,
listening to you guys,

38:12.556 --> 38:14.717
l've got a glimmer of hope.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.522
l thought for a sec
you had the son of a bitch beat.

38:17.595 --> 38:18.562
- Well, well, well.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.529
Look who's back from the dead.

38:20.598 --> 38:21.656
- Ease up, man.

38:21.732 --> 38:24.758
Ease up.

38:24.835 --> 38:28.771
l'm having a change of heart
or something like that.

38:28.839 --> 38:31.569
l'm thinking letting
you people die,

38:31.642 --> 38:34.440
it's not right.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.037
l haven't done nothing good
in a long time.

38:39.750 --> 38:44.551
l said l never killed nobody.

38:44.622 --> 38:48.752
That's a lie.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.691
[door slams]

38:50.761 --> 38:52.991
l want my cut of cash
you gave that bitch of yours.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.031
- What cash?

38:54.098 --> 38:55.497
Man, you fucking tripping.

38:55.566 --> 38:57.329
- l know about the money belt

38:57.401 --> 38:58.959
and those Brentwood bitches
last month.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.539
- You accusing me
of holding out?

39:02.606 --> 39:04.801
- Nah, l'm straight saying it.

39:07.244 --> 39:08.609
Don't turn your back to me, man.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.579
[grunts]

39:10.648 --> 39:11.774
click!

39:17.021 --> 39:18.352
Pull guns on people?

39:18.422 --> 39:20.287
- For sure, motherfucker.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.757
- l got a gun too.

39:22.593 --> 39:25.562
[gunshot]

39:28.733 --> 39:32.100
l dumped his body in a dumpster
in downtown L.A.

39:32.169 --> 39:36.503
at the Cinco de Mayo festival.

39:36.574 --> 39:37.905
He said he never liked
the Mexicans

39:37.975 --> 39:39.067
and their parades.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.577
One last childish act
on my part.

39:43.948 --> 39:47.475
A couple of days later l went
to the morgue with our mother.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.111
l stood over the body.

39:50.187 --> 39:53.486
l didn't say anything.

39:53.557 --> 39:57.687
l went to the street and sold
the rest of our stuff.

39:57.762 --> 40:01.698
Wow, l never told nobody that.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.735
[groaning]

40:07.438 --> 40:10.373
l didn't speak or see too much
of my mother after the funeral.

40:10.441 --> 40:11.533
[clock ticks]

40:11.609 --> 40:15.272
l'll never see either
of them again.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.439
l'll never have a chance
to say l'm sorry.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.880
l want my mother
to forgive me.

40:22.953 --> 40:24.716
l deserve to die.

40:24.789 --> 40:25.983
l want to be forgiven.

40:26.056 --> 40:29.492
Somebody just forgive me.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.028
- He who seeks forgiveness
shall find it.

40:34.865 --> 40:35.832
[clock ticking]

40:35.900 --> 40:39.131
- We're no better off
than we were before.

40:39.203 --> 40:41.728
We have nothing new,
and there's like a minute left.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.274
- Here's something new.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.605
That guy said he's been
planning this for two years.

40:46.677 --> 40:49.441
- Okay, what were we all doing
two years ago?

40:49.513 --> 40:51.640
- Two years ago
l did thirty days

40:51.715 --> 40:53.012
for busting some joker
in the head

40:53.083 --> 40:54.311
for hassling one of my dancers.

40:54.385 --> 40:55.352
But no one is going to give

40:55.419 --> 40:56.408
two shits about that one.

40:56.487 --> 40:57.454
- No.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.149
- Two years ago l was just-

41:00.224 --> 41:04.593
l had the same job
selling insurance,

41:04.662 --> 41:06.857
approvals, dismissals.

41:06.931 --> 41:07.920
l don't know.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.363
lt's nothing unusual.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.400
- Kelley?

41:11.569 --> 41:12.536
Kelley?

41:12.603 --> 41:13.968
Two years ago?

41:14.038 --> 41:17.007
[door creaking]

41:18.342 --> 41:19.536
- Why are you here?

41:19.610 --> 41:20.599
- We know part of the answer.

41:20.678 --> 41:21.702
We've got some of it.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.043
- All or nothing.

41:24.114 --> 41:29.677
- Son of a bitch.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.948
l'll see you in hell.

41:36.026 --> 41:36.993
- l know.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.028
[gunshot]

41:38.095 --> 41:41.030
[all shouting]

41:41.098 --> 41:43.089
- What are you doing?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.067
Stop this!

41:56.780 --> 41:59.749
[door slams]

42:03.821 --> 42:05.846
Father, you still with us?

42:05.923 --> 42:07.584
- You're not going to like
what l have to say.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.058
- Anything is better
than nothing at this point.

42:12.129 --> 42:13.721
- Either say it or don't.

42:13.797 --> 42:16.163
- l figured out why l am here.

42:16.233 --> 42:17.723
- Well, holy shit!

42:17.801 --> 42:21.328
- l know why someone else
was in this room as well.

42:21.405 --> 42:22.702
l know what we have done

42:22.773 --> 42:24.502
to the man that holds
us captive.

42:24.575 --> 42:25.542
- So what is it?

42:25.609 --> 42:27.076
- Yeah, spill it.

42:27.144 --> 42:28.441
- l can't.

42:28.512 --> 42:30.139
- What do you mean, you can't?

42:30.214 --> 42:31.374
Come on, Father.

42:31.448 --> 42:33.075
- What was said to me
was said in confidence.

42:33.150 --> 42:34.117
l can't repeat it.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.414
- You want to play Pictionary
or something? Fine.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.512
Me and you, Father,
against her and Mandarin Duck.

42:38.589 --> 42:40.147
- l can't reveal
what was said to me.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.521
There's nothing l can do.

42:41.592 --> 42:42.616
My relationship with God

42:42.693 --> 42:43.887
goes beyond my life
and yours.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.258
- This is bullshit, Father.

42:45.329 --> 42:48.025
- You better start talking
right now, or so help me,

42:48.098 --> 42:49.565
l will goddamn crack that head
of yours.

42:49.633 --> 42:50.600
- You'll do what?

42:52.102 --> 42:53.899
l'm facing death already.

42:53.971 --> 42:55.598
l have no fear of death

42:55.673 --> 42:57.937
when it comes to upholding
the Lord's law.

42:58.008 --> 43:00.238
My loyalty will not
be questioned.

43:00.311 --> 43:01.505
My devotion does not exist

43:01.579 --> 43:03.171
only when the situation deems
convenient.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.112
- People are dead because
of you.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.082
- You don't know that
to be true.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.743
- The hell l don't, cocksucker!

43:08.819 --> 43:10.480
Leon laid there dying,

43:10.554 --> 43:12.351
but at least he had the balls
to speak his mind,

43:12.423 --> 43:14.550
even though it went against
his own fucked-up judgment.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.616
And now you're going to have
all of us die

43:16.694 --> 43:17.854
because you're gonna keep quiet

43:17.928 --> 43:19.793
behind some collar
and dusty oath?

43:19.863 --> 43:22.491
- Sully, would you turn in
your brother

43:22.566 --> 43:23.692
for a lighter sentence?

43:24.935 --> 43:26.493
- My brother's dead.

43:27.705 --> 43:29.639
- So then your father.

43:29.707 --> 43:32.005
Would you give up your father
to save your own skin?

43:32.076 --> 43:33.566
- l would never cross my father.

43:33.644 --> 43:36.112
- So then you can understand
my situation.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.704
- No, l can't!

43:38.682 --> 43:41.344
- lt's like waking up from one
nightmare into another.

43:41.418 --> 43:44.114
- Shut the hell up, Eddie.

43:44.188 --> 43:46.656
- lf Father Francis
has made up his mind,

43:46.724 --> 43:48.453
we're just gonna have to

43:48.525 --> 43:50.857
get out of here
without him.

43:50.928 --> 43:52.520
- What?
You're defending the cocksucker?

43:52.596 --> 43:54.029
- No.

43:54.098 --> 43:57.761
But l got a wife to get home to,
and we're wasting time arguing.

43:57.835 --> 43:59.632
- To hell with Francis, okay?

43:59.703 --> 44:01.034
lf he's not gonna talk,

44:01.105 --> 44:03.198
we're never gonna figure out
why he's here.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.106
So if we want to live,
we're gonna have to escape.

44:06.176 --> 44:08.610
Okay, we're gonna have
to take him down.

44:08.679 --> 44:10.670
And we have to face the fact
that we may have to kill him.

44:10.748 --> 44:12.682
- On, l ain't got no problem
with that.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.377
- Okay, hold on.

44:14.451 --> 44:16.385
What do we know?

44:16.453 --> 44:19.013
We know Greeley robbed
Chan's liquor store.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.818
And we know Kelley
prosecuted him.

44:20.891 --> 44:24.725
- Okay, well, that's two
out of nine, Eddie.

44:24.795 --> 44:26.524
- Maybe there's more to it.

44:26.597 --> 44:28.531
Maybe it goes beyond
those people

44:28.599 --> 44:31.693
who are directly responsible
for him going to jail.

44:31.769 --> 44:33.396
Maybe he's thinking
in bigger terms.

44:33.470 --> 44:34.835
- Yeah, maybe we're not

44:34.905 --> 44:36.202
all connected in this.

44:36.273 --> 44:38.741
Maybe he's going after everybody
that's ever done

44:38.809 --> 44:40.276
anything wrong to this guy.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.245
- We need to come clean.

44:44.314 --> 44:48.546
Completely clean
about everything, right now,

44:48.619 --> 44:51.087
all of us.

44:51.155 --> 44:54.124
[clock ticking]

45:04.001 --> 45:07.630
- All right.

45:07.705 --> 45:08.967
You want a story?

45:09.039 --> 45:10.199
Eight years ago

45:10.274 --> 45:13.937
this old man came in
and slapped me around

45:14.011 --> 45:15.239
in front of my crew.

45:15.312 --> 45:17.473
Some crazy bastard
who owed me money

45:17.548 --> 45:20.574
came in and tried to punk me
in front of my people.

45:22.252 --> 45:26.018
l went back to his pawn shop
that night.

45:26.090 --> 45:29.526
Yeah, l went back,
and l firebombed it.

45:29.593 --> 45:30.560
Boom!

45:30.627 --> 45:32.754
[laughs]

45:35.399 --> 45:39.495
The problem...

45:39.570 --> 45:43.233
the problem...

45:43.307 --> 45:47.471
l didn't know he lived upstairs
in an apartment

45:47.544 --> 45:48.875
with his grandkids.

45:57.121 --> 45:59.021
That's why l deserve to die.

46:10.434 --> 46:17.306
- lt was my first year
on the force,

46:17.374 --> 46:18.705
l was working
the valley division,

46:18.776 --> 46:24.772
and my partner got into it
with this speed freak.

46:24.848 --> 46:25.837
lt was bad.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.076
The kid was all tweaked out,

46:27.151 --> 46:29.244
and my partner was having
a really rough day.

46:31.555 --> 46:34.718
The kid took a swing
at my partner,

46:34.792 --> 46:37.090
and that was it.

46:37.161 --> 46:39.288
He beat the hell
out of this kid.

46:39.363 --> 46:44.096
l really wanted to stop it,

46:44.168 --> 46:49.105
but he looked up at me.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.231
He looked at me,

46:50.307 --> 46:51.672
and he asked me
if l wanted to join in.

46:51.742 --> 46:54.142
- You joined in?

46:54.211 --> 46:56.441
- Yeah, l didn't want
to hurt my reputation.

46:56.513 --> 46:57.673
You know, l mean,

46:57.748 --> 46:59.375
it was my first year
out on the street.

46:59.449 --> 47:00.541
l mean, you know what l mean,
Kelley.

47:00.617 --> 47:01.982
- So you beat the kid.

47:02.052 --> 47:03.849
- Yeah, but God damn it,
l'm not proud of it.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.718
- Well, did you go
to lnternal Affairs?

47:05.789 --> 47:08.849
- No.

47:08.926 --> 47:11.690
l stuck around
for two more years

47:11.762 --> 47:13.593
and got transferred
out of there.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.655
- So why would your old partner
pull you down here

47:15.732 --> 47:17.666
if you never turned him in
or told anyone?

47:17.734 --> 47:19.429
- lt wasn't my partner.

47:19.503 --> 47:22.666
l was thinking maybe the kid
finally tracked us down

47:22.739 --> 47:25.572
not for beating him up.

47:25.642 --> 47:27.234
For blinding him.

47:27.311 --> 47:29.438
- That's awful.

47:29.513 --> 47:30.946
What was the kid's name?

47:31.014 --> 47:33.915
- Alfie Martinez.

47:33.984 --> 47:38.045
And l don't know if that's
the reason why l'm down here,

47:38.121 --> 47:41.682
but that's what haunts me
every day of my life,

47:41.758 --> 47:44.022
that l didn't stand up.

47:44.094 --> 47:47.393
l didn't have the courage
to do anything,

47:47.464 --> 47:50.399
to stand up to my superiors.

47:50.467 --> 47:52.560
- So if your old partner
is still alive,

47:52.636 --> 47:54.627
wouldn't it make sense that
he'd be in here with us?

47:54.705 --> 47:57.640
- Yeah, that's just a dead end,

47:57.708 --> 47:58.902
another dead end.

47:58.976 --> 48:00.739
- l'm telling you,
we're wasting time.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.904
We've got to find our own way
out of here like Leon did.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.107
- Yeah, that worked out
real well for him.

48:05.182 --> 48:08.913
- [speaking foreign language]

48:08.986 --> 48:10.578
- Yeah, sing it, sister!

48:10.654 --> 48:11.621
Hallelujah!

48:11.688 --> 48:12.655
Right, cocksucker?

48:12.723 --> 48:16.625
- Shut the hell up, Sully!

48:18.462 --> 48:20.191
- We got to think of something.

48:27.304 --> 48:29.465
l just thought of something.

48:29.539 --> 48:31.837
l don't know if this
is anything,

48:31.909 --> 48:33.570
but since we're confessing
our sins,

48:33.644 --> 48:35.475
and there is a priest here-

48:35.545 --> 48:37.410
- All right, just spit it out,
Eddie.

48:37.481 --> 48:39.415
- When l was in college,

48:39.483 --> 48:42.145
we had some girls-
strippers over for a party.

48:42.219 --> 48:43.379
We were all drinking,

48:43.453 --> 48:45.819
and l spent some time
with one of them.

48:45.889 --> 48:48.449
We both got really drunk, and-

48:48.525 --> 48:49.514
- And you banged her.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.652
- Yeah, but she said
it was rape.

48:52.729 --> 48:54.924
- Oh, and here all this time
we thought you were so perfect.

48:54.998 --> 48:57.626
lt turns out you're just another
asshole frat boy.

48:57.701 --> 48:59.635
- They dropped the charges
due to lack of evidence.

48:59.703 --> 49:01.330
- Mom and dad must have been
so proud.

49:01.405 --> 49:02.838
- l'm just trying to help.

49:02.906 --> 49:04.066
- l mean, something might click.

49:04.141 --> 49:05.438
lsn't that the whole point?

49:05.509 --> 49:07.374
- No, you're getting us further
away from the point

49:07.444 --> 49:08.502
l was trying to make.

49:08.578 --> 49:11.046
- Guys, look,
this is about the robbery.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.103
We're missing something.

49:12.182 --> 49:13.649
l know we are.

49:13.717 --> 49:15.344
- No, there's nothing else with
the robbery; l promise you.

49:15.419 --> 49:17.410
- [scoffs]

49:20.624 --> 49:23.616
- What was that, Francis?

49:23.694 --> 49:25.821
- You know we're going down
the wrong road, don't you?

49:25.896 --> 49:27.659
- Yeah, 20 years of poker tells
me that's a ''yes.''

49:27.731 --> 49:29.028
What do you know, Father?
- Forget about the robbery!

49:29.099 --> 49:30.225
Okay, it doesn't matter
what he knows.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.358
- Shut up, Kelley!

49:31.435 --> 49:33.300
- You were about to beat
that kid to death,

49:33.370 --> 49:34.735
and now you won't help me
kill the guy

49:34.805 --> 49:35.999
who's ready to execute us all?

49:36.073 --> 49:37.199
What the hell is wrong with you?

49:37.274 --> 49:38.298
What's wrong with all of you?

49:38.375 --> 49:39.637
- Hey, l'm with you, Kelley.

49:39.710 --> 49:41.575
But this cocksucker here
is about ready to crack,

49:41.645 --> 49:43.636
and l'm pretty damned interested
to hear what he has to say.

49:43.714 --> 49:45.773
- l know you want to tell us,
Father.

49:45.849 --> 49:46.816
- Aw, come on.

49:46.883 --> 49:47.850
You ready to break
that oath, Father?

49:49.186 --> 49:50.153
- This isn't easy, okay?

49:50.220 --> 49:51.414
- Just say it.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.183
- lt's the right thing to do.

49:53.256 --> 49:55.690
- What if l said
that l knew for a fact

49:55.759 --> 49:58.193
that Wade Greeley did not
rob Chan's store?

49:58.261 --> 49:59.228
- Bullshit.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.661
Chan was the eyewitness.

50:00.731 --> 50:02.892
Greeley didn't have an alibi,
and l had the evidence,

50:02.966 --> 50:04.433
concrete evidence.

50:04.501 --> 50:05.661
- Did Greeley say
he was innocent?

50:05.736 --> 50:06.703
- Of course he said
he was innocent.

50:06.770 --> 50:08.101
Everybody's innocent.

50:08.171 --> 50:10.765
Nobody wants to be convicted
once they're caught.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.809
- What do you know about it,
Father?

50:12.876 --> 50:13.865
- No, l'm telling you.

50:13.944 --> 50:15.411
Greeley was guilty.

50:17.114 --> 50:18.138
- Son of a bitch.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.048
- What?

50:21.118 --> 50:22.346
- One of us confessed
to the crime

50:22.419 --> 50:23.909
in Father Francis' confessional.

50:23.987 --> 50:24.954
l bet that's it.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.887
- ls that it?

50:26.957 --> 50:28.049
ls it, Father?

50:28.125 --> 50:29.353
- Whatever Father Francis knows,

50:29.426 --> 50:30.586
he knows from the confessional.

50:30.660 --> 50:31.957
Otherwise, he would tell us.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.394
- Has anyone ever been
to confession

50:33.463 --> 50:34.794
in the San Fernando Valley?

50:34.865 --> 50:36.264
- Yeah, right.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.322
- No.

50:37.401 --> 50:38.368
- Christian!

50:38.435 --> 50:39.402
[chuckles]

50:39.469 --> 50:40.993
lt has to be Christian.

50:42.439 --> 50:43.633
- You all saw the father's face

50:43.707 --> 50:45.231
when l couldn't remember
the Hail Mary.

50:45.308 --> 50:46.332
l reminded him of Christian.

50:46.410 --> 50:47.741
He forgot
the same prayer earlier.

50:47.811 --> 50:48.778
Remember?

50:50.514 --> 50:52.812
What could Christian have told
Father Francis?

50:55.085 --> 50:57.645
- That he robbed
the liquor store.

51:05.796 --> 51:07.457
- You've known this whole time?

51:07.531 --> 51:08.998
- l did not know the whole time.

51:09.066 --> 51:11.591
lt wasn't until after Chan came
up with the robbery

51:11.668 --> 51:12.930
that l knew for sure.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.231
- Cocksucker!

51:14.304 --> 51:16.169
- l told you you wouldn't like
what l had to say.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.433
- Are you absolutely positive

51:17.507 --> 51:19.771
that it was Christian
in the confessional?

51:21.445 --> 51:26.940
- The Lord is with thee.

51:27.017 --> 51:30.384
Dude, how does the rest
of that go?

51:30.454 --> 51:32.479
- lf l had a Bible,
l would put my hand on it.

51:32.556 --> 51:34.524
- You got the wrong man,
prosecutor.

51:34.591 --> 51:36.650
Wade Greeley's the wrong guy.

51:36.726 --> 51:38.455
- l had the evidence
against him.

51:38.528 --> 51:41.088
- Regardless, l mean, this is
a whole new ball game now.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.598
- Holy shit.

51:43.667 --> 51:44.634
Sully.

51:44.701 --> 51:45.668
- Yeah?

51:45.735 --> 51:47.760
- Christian got out of jail
the same time

51:47.838 --> 51:49.328
Chan's store was robbed.

51:49.406 --> 51:50.964
- So what does that
have to do with me?

51:51.041 --> 51:53.475
- What happens to people
who don't pay you?

51:55.078 --> 51:56.670
- lf they owe a little,
l go for their knees.

51:56.746 --> 51:58.236
lf they owe a lot,
l go for their jugular.

51:58.315 --> 51:59.577
- Yeah, well, does Christian

51:59.649 --> 52:02.083
look like the type of kid
that could take a beating?

52:03.787 --> 52:04.811
- So what?

52:04.888 --> 52:05.855
What are you saying?

52:05.922 --> 52:06.889
- Christian robbed Chan

52:06.957 --> 52:09.585
to get you the money.

52:09.659 --> 52:11.820
He said that he got
out of jail in May

52:11.895 --> 52:12.862
and paid you soon after.

52:12.929 --> 52:14.419
How else could he have gotten
the money?

52:15.999 --> 52:17.626
lt fits.

52:19.703 --> 52:22.831
- Wait a second.

52:22.906 --> 52:23.998
So you're telling me,

52:24.074 --> 52:25.405
of all the fucked-up shit
l've done

52:25.475 --> 52:28.069
through the course of my life,

52:28.145 --> 52:29.635
l loaned some dead dumbass
five grand,

52:29.713 --> 52:31.203
and that's what
l'm gonna die for?

52:31.281 --> 52:32.248
- The kid needed a motive.

52:32.315 --> 52:33.339
l think you're it.

52:33.416 --> 52:35.441
- [laughs]

52:35.519 --> 52:38.283
That's goddamn ridiculous.

52:39.856 --> 52:41.050
You're serious?

52:42.392 --> 52:43.620
All l did was give him
some cash.

52:43.693 --> 52:44.660
l got to die for that?

52:44.728 --> 52:45.820
That's bullshit!

52:45.896 --> 52:47.523
- The connection between you
and Christian

52:47.597 --> 52:49.224
has been there the whole time.

52:49.299 --> 52:50.698
We just never thought
anything of it.

52:50.767 --> 52:52.758
- Oh, and l still don't.

52:52.836 --> 52:55.361
Of all the shit l-

52:55.438 --> 52:57.133
oh, hey there, asshole!

52:57.207 --> 52:58.174
- Why are you here?

52:58.241 --> 52:59.333
- You know what?
We don't know.

52:59.409 --> 53:00.376
But guess what.

53:00.443 --> 53:01.967
l don't give a fuck.

53:02.045 --> 53:03.910
l don't know what kind of shit
you got going on here,

53:03.980 --> 53:04.969
but l'm sick of it.

53:05.048 --> 53:06.015
You've got me sweating,

53:06.082 --> 53:08.175
rethinking all the horrible
things that l've done in my life

53:08.251 --> 53:09.411
and all the people l've crossed.

53:09.486 --> 53:10.680
For what?

53:10.754 --> 53:12.244
For some dumbass that l loaned

53:12.322 --> 53:15.257
$5,000 to?

53:15.325 --> 53:16.792
Well, guess what.

53:16.860 --> 53:19.090
That's how l do business,
and that's how l get shit done.

53:19.162 --> 53:21.027
l don't apologize for shit.

53:21.097 --> 53:24.624
- Knowing what you know,
knowing how your life will end,

53:24.701 --> 53:26.259
would you change the way
you do business?

53:26.336 --> 53:28.167
- Hell no!

53:28.238 --> 53:29.330
l don't regret anything.

53:29.406 --> 53:31.431
l wouldn't do a damn thing
different.

53:31.508 --> 53:34.170
[laughs]

53:34.244 --> 53:35.677
What's the matter?

53:35.745 --> 53:38.976
You don't like that, do you,
you dirty revenge-seeking pussy?

53:39.049 --> 53:41.313
l don't regret anything.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.818
What, you want me
to regret my life?

53:43.887 --> 53:45.252
Fuck you.

53:45.322 --> 53:48.849
Oh, you want the satisfaction
of me begging for my life,

53:48.925 --> 53:50.290
don't you?

53:50.360 --> 53:52.089
Fuck you.

53:52.162 --> 53:53.925
You want the satisfaction
of killing all of us,

53:53.997 --> 53:55.430
thinking it's gonna change
our lives.

53:55.498 --> 53:56.465
Whah, whah, whah.

53:56.533 --> 53:59.263
Well, fuck you!

54:00.837 --> 54:04.034
l take that back.

54:04.107 --> 54:05.768
l take all that back.

54:07.944 --> 54:09.639
Yeah.

54:09.713 --> 54:11.203
l'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction

54:11.281 --> 54:16.685
of me being pissed off
while l die.

54:16.753 --> 54:21.315
Of all the shit
you could have killed me for,

54:21.391 --> 54:24.792
five grand?

54:24.861 --> 54:27.830
[laughs]

54:31.268 --> 54:32.326
Fuck you!

54:34.738 --> 54:37.229
Come on, bastard.

54:37.307 --> 54:38.740
Let's do this.

54:38.808 --> 54:40.969
Hit me right here in the head,
just like my brother.

54:41.044 --> 54:42.739
Reunite me with him.

54:42.812 --> 54:43.836
Come on, asshole!

54:43.913 --> 54:44.880
Pull the trigger.

54:46.683 --> 54:48.344
- But it's not your turn.

54:48.418 --> 54:50.477
lt's Eddie's.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.488
- Me?

54:54.557 --> 54:57.219
No, no, no.

54:57.294 --> 55:01.321
Please, no.

55:01.398 --> 55:02.490
No, no.

55:02.565 --> 55:03.532
Don't kill me.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.000
Just tell me why l'm here.

55:07.037 --> 55:09.972
[gunshot]

55:12.676 --> 55:14.007
- Damn it!

55:14.077 --> 55:15.772
One person dies
every ten minutes.

55:15.845 --> 55:16.971
That's what you said!

55:17.047 --> 55:18.639
Father Francis is dead.

55:18.715 --> 55:19.909
You cannot take Eddie now.

55:26.389 --> 55:27.356
- Really?

55:27.424 --> 55:29.688
Five grand?

55:33.630 --> 55:35.860
[gun clicks]

55:35.932 --> 55:37.024
[gunshot]

55:37.100 --> 55:39.034
- You shouldn't be
in such a hurry to die.

55:39.102 --> 55:41.570
lf this is the end for you,

55:41.638 --> 55:43.196
you'll want to make
every minute count.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.234
- This doesn't
have to continue.

55:48.311 --> 55:50.643
Okay, we know why
you brought most of us here,

55:50.714 --> 55:54.206
and we know what
you must have been feeling,

55:54.284 --> 55:55.717
what you must be feeling now.

55:55.785 --> 55:58.185
Okay, l think l speak for all
of us

55:58.254 --> 56:00.313
when we say we wish we could
go back and change history,

56:00.390 --> 56:01.880
but we can't.

56:01.958 --> 56:04.426
Wade.

56:04.494 --> 56:07.759
Wade Greeley?

56:07.831 --> 56:12.393
Whatever it is that you think
we've done to you, whatever-

56:12.469 --> 56:14.061
whatever it is
you've done here today,

56:14.137 --> 56:15.104
we can make right.

56:15.171 --> 56:16.502
You just have to talk to us.

56:16.573 --> 56:17.540
Look, we can help.

56:17.607 --> 56:19.734
l can help.

56:19.809 --> 56:20.935
Okay, whatever it is you want,

56:21.010 --> 56:23.535
we-we-
l can make that happen.

56:23.613 --> 56:25.774
Do you understand
what l'm telling you, Wade?

56:29.953 --> 56:32.945
- l'm not Wade Greeley.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.934
[door slams]

56:46.002 --> 56:46.202
[clock ticking]

56:46.202 --> 56:47.692
[clock ticking]

56:47.771 --> 56:50.035
- lt's not Wade Greeley.

56:50.106 --> 56:53.132
This doesn't make any sense.

56:53.209 --> 56:55.575
- There's way too many
coincidences for it not to be

56:55.645 --> 56:56.805
this guy, Greeley.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.814
- l've spent five grand
on a bottle of whiskey

56:58.882 --> 56:59.906
without a care in the world.

56:59.983 --> 57:01.575
- Sully, we get it.

57:01.651 --> 57:03.175
- l'm telling you,
he's gonna kill us all.

57:03.253 --> 57:05.881
Okay, he doesn't care
if we come up with his plan.

57:05.955 --> 57:10.255
- lf he just wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

57:10.326 --> 57:12.487
He's here to make a point.

57:12.562 --> 57:14.462
But do we really think this
isn't Greeley?

57:14.531 --> 57:16.260
- lf it isn't, it has to be
somebody close to him,

57:16.332 --> 57:18.095
somebody that could help him
plan this.

57:18.168 --> 57:20.398
Kelley, back at the trial,

57:20.470 --> 57:21.732
was there anyone there?

57:21.805 --> 57:23.329
Were there any friends
or family,

57:23.406 --> 57:24.532
anyone who stood by him?

57:24.607 --> 57:26.837
- No, no, he didn't have
anything or anyone.

57:26.910 --> 57:29.208
l don't even think he made bail.

57:29.279 --> 57:30.541
- Can you give us a few more
details?

57:30.613 --> 57:32.808
- Jeez, this was so long ago.

57:32.882 --> 57:34.008
Do you realize how many trials

57:34.083 --> 57:35.448
l've had since then,

57:35.518 --> 57:36.485
since before then?

57:36.553 --> 57:38.748
- Okay, let's think.

57:38.822 --> 57:41.586
Leon said that he'd been
planning this for two years.

57:41.658 --> 57:43.319
When did Greeley's case
go to trial?

57:43.393 --> 57:45.657
- l don't remember.

57:45.728 --> 57:47.218
- Can you at least tell us

57:47.297 --> 57:49.857
how many years
he got in prison?

57:49.933 --> 57:52.561
- Armed robbery, assault,
no plea.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.102
Five years, maybe.

57:56.539 --> 57:58.734
- Well, then the years
don't add up.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.400
lf l was wrongly convicted
of a crime,

58:00.477 --> 58:02.775
l would start plotting my
revenge the day l was convicted.

58:02.846 --> 58:03.813
- That's what l'm saying.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.541
Nothing about this makes sense.

58:05.615 --> 58:08.277
The only way we're gonna get
out of this is if we escape.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.412
- Was Christian in the lineup
when Chan picked Greeley?

58:11.488 --> 58:12.887
- No, if Christian was
in the lineup,

58:12.956 --> 58:15.322
Chan would have recognized him
when we pulled the hoods off.

58:15.391 --> 58:18.053
- She didn't recognize Kelley
until later.

58:18.127 --> 58:19.094
- Well, maybe she did.

58:19.162 --> 58:20.322
l mean, nobody understood
what she was saying.

58:20.396 --> 58:21.727
- Mrs. Chan?

58:21.798 --> 58:22.992
- Give it up.
We're getting off track.

58:23.066 --> 58:24.192
- l'm just coming up
with possibilities.

58:24.267 --> 58:26.201
- Well, to hell
with your possibilities.

58:26.269 --> 58:28.169
- Why are you pissed at me?

58:28.238 --> 58:30.570
- Because maybe we still
don't know jack about you!

58:30.640 --> 58:32.870
- Are you really that stupid
to think l'm hiding something?

58:32.942 --> 58:34.170
l told you everything
that l can think of,

58:34.244 --> 58:35.211
so don't blame me.

58:35.278 --> 58:36.245
- Something about you

58:36.312 --> 58:37.540
still doesn't
sit right with me, Eddie.

58:37.614 --> 58:39.013
- You know,
you've been riding me

58:39.082 --> 58:40.515
and picking on me
this whole time.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.550
What is your problem?

58:41.618 --> 58:42.585
- l might be dead
in ten minutes!

58:42.652 --> 58:43.619
That's my fucking problem!

58:43.686 --> 58:45.551
- l think we all know
who's next.

58:45.622 --> 58:48.352
- Calm down.

58:48.424 --> 58:49.516
- What about you, Jackson?

58:49.592 --> 58:50.957
We still don't know
why you're here.

58:51.027 --> 58:52.756
All we know is that you
beat a kid blind

58:52.829 --> 58:54.023
and cheated on your wife.

58:54.097 --> 58:56.292
- Well, look who's
grown some balls.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.890
- l think l got it.

58:57.967 --> 58:59.491
- You better watch
your tone Eddie,

58:59.569 --> 59:01.730
or l'm gonna start thinking
you're the psycho's partner,

59:01.804 --> 59:03.772
or at least until l see your
brains against the wall.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.398
- Yeah, yeah, well,
not if l see yours first.

59:05.475 --> 59:06.442
- Fine, go ahead!

59:06.509 --> 59:07.476
Sign me up!

59:07.544 --> 59:08.738
- Hey, shut up!

59:10.346 --> 59:12.109
All right, you guys are worse
than my strippers.

59:12.181 --> 59:13.273
Now listen.

59:13.349 --> 59:15.146
Leon said that
he killed his brother

59:15.218 --> 59:17.413
and dumped him during the
Cinco de Mayo parade, remember?

59:17.487 --> 59:18.715
- So what?

59:18.788 --> 59:20.756
- Well, Christian said
that he got out of jail in May.

59:20.823 --> 59:21.881
- And?

59:21.958 --> 59:24.222
- What if that was around
the same time?

59:24.294 --> 59:27.161
Look, Christian
got out of jail, right?

59:27.230 --> 59:30.597
And he said he got my five grand
right afterwards, right?

59:30.667 --> 59:33.966
Well, if we go back
and think about it,

59:34.037 --> 59:36.096
Christian said that he had
nothing when he left jail.

59:37.273 --> 59:40.003
- l had nothing
going in to prison.

59:40.076 --> 59:41.771
l had even less getting out.

59:41.844 --> 59:44.438
- But somehow he was able
to pull off

59:44.514 --> 59:46.141
this big liquor store
robbery heist?

59:47.216 --> 59:48.581
Where did he get a gun

59:48.651 --> 59:50.312
to rob Mrs. Chan?

59:50.386 --> 59:52.946
- Leon said the easiest product
to move were guns.

59:54.791 --> 59:56.816
- Guns can be better than cash.

59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.488
- So you think Leon sold the gun
to Christian

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.190
that he used to rob Chan's
liquor store?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.403
- So Sully gave Christian
the motive for the robbery.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.532
Leon gave him opportunity.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.600
Chan identified the wrong man.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.837
Kelley locked him up.

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:18.380
And Father Francis didn't
go to the cops

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.506
after he found out the truth.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:26.212
Okay, so that leaves Jackson,
me, and Coogan.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.416
But we can all agree that this
all started with Christian

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.617
borrowing money from Sully.

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.388
Between that and Greeley
going to jail

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:36.057
is our new time line.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.430
When Christian borrowed
the money from Sully,

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.664
l was studying
pharmaceuticals in Arizona.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.765
- Okay, well, Christian said
that he was dealing drugs.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.173
Could he have gotten them
from you?

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.608
- No.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.043
l didn't have any access
to drugs.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.411
- All right, all right,
we've narrowed this down some.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.744
- Narrowed it down?

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:57.809
All we got is a robbery,
drug dealing, and a pedophile.

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:58.854
Sorry, buddy.

01:00:58.921 --> 01:00:59.888
- Buddy?

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.014
- Look, Sully is a criminal.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.421
Okay, he's a killer.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.687
We would have taken him down
100 times if we had the chance.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.160
Now he's your best friend?

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.457
- Oh, l'm sorry
for liking the guy

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:08.588
who's trying to save my life.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.257
- Thank you.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.494
And for bacon,
you're not so bad yourself.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:13.535
- Look, our only chance

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.968
is that we think
Eddie might be next.

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.733
And then hopefully after that,
Sully's next.

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:17.966
So you and l can take him down.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.635
- God, you are one twisted
home-wrecking bitch.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.905
- Oh, well, it's good to know
it only takes a gun to your head

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:23.946
for you to speak your mind.

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.004
- You know what?

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.777
The worst thing l did was not
beating that kid

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.817
till he was blind.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.512
lt was fucking the lawyer.

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.553
- [laughs]

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:32.781
- Oh, ouch, that hurts.

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:35.289
Jackson, l hope you die
for getting me into this.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.382
- What are you talking about?

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.290
l didn't get you into this.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.953
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.189
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.459
You just said that Jackson
got you into this.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.125
What does that mean?
- What does what mean?

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.499
We have, like, seconds left
till he comes in.

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:56.412
[door creaking]

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.875
- Why are you here?

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.919
- Because this bitch
knows something,

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.113
and she won't talk!

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.935
- [speaking foreign language]

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.556
[gunshot]

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.025
- Please, please!

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.532
l beg you!

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.592
You can't kill me.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:55.000
You have to let me go.

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.369
My child needs me.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.704
Okay, my son needs his mommy.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:02.703
You're a human being.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:03.905
You can understand.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.380
You can't take a mother
away from her son.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.814
- Your son William goes
to the Sacred Heart School,

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:14.755
where he is picked up every day
by your hired help.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.123
And when was the last time

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.455
you actually spent time
with him?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.654
And how long will it be

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:23.187
before you pack him off
to some boarding school?

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.564
Do not use your child
as an excuse.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.604
lt pisses me off.

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.432
And it should piss you off
as well.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.485
[door slams]

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:42.746
[door slams]

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.582
- What was he talking about,
Kelley?

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.884
- [crying]

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.719
- lt looks like you might be
a dad, Jackson.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:51.783
- Billy's mine?

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.123
l didn't think l could.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:56.461
My wife and l,
we'd been trying for-

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.829
l didn't think it was possible.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.094
- Yeah, well, it's possible.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.898
Maybe if you had spent a little
less time with me

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:02.938
and a little more with her.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:07.271
- How could you do that to me?

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:12.007
How could you just
keep that from me?

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.413
l know our relationship,
the breakup was bad,

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.577
but how could you just
cut me off like that?

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.553
- l had to do what was best
for me.

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:22.386
Okay, jackass over there was
never gonna leave his wife.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.720
He would rather just lead me on.

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:24.953
So when l found out,

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:28.155
l just blamed it
on someone else.

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:33.260
- What you did was wrong
and downright selfish.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.997
You need to start talking.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.904
And it doesn't matter
what you're holding back.

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.236
l don't care.

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:40.400
l forgive you,

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.909
but we have to get
out of here alive.

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.409
- Do you want to die?

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.540
- l might as well be dead
if this gets out.

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.108
- Before, you said Jackson got
you into this.

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:51.551
How?

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:55.284
- Look.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:58.259
Wade Greeley was picked up
two miles from the liquor store.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:01.319
He was a good match
to Chan's description.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.695
And no one could verify
his lame-ass alibi.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:07.761
And then Chan picked him
out of the lineup.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.397
l had him.
l had to have him.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.306
You remember what l was
going through, Jackson.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.310
The mother and son,
the abortion case:

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.504
two in a row lost.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.173
- l was just getting
into the life

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.274
that l had worked so hard for,

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:25.081
and l felt the pressure.

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.712
You know, l had to have
a conviction,

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:27.778
or l was on my way out.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.256
l was the lowest
on the totem pole,

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.350
and no one was
taking me seriously.

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:36.562
l had to win at all costs.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.161
- Losing cases
doesn't make you incompetent.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.172
- No, but combine that
with budget cuts

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.298
and an affair with Jackson

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:46.864
that was growing more public
every day,

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:47.910
and it doesn't look good.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.176
- What did you make me do,
Kelley?

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.276
- l had Chan's testimony,
but it was shaky at best.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:00.516
l would never be able convince
a jury that a 60-year-old woman

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.250
could positively identify
someone,

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.919
especially after she'd been
pistol-whipped.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.655
l had to put Greeley
at the scene.

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:10.062
During the struggle,

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.566
Chan grabbed Christian
by the head

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.761
and got a few couple hairs.

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:15.827
So l knew l just had to
get some of Wade's hair

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:20.001
and make the switch.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.874
So l snuck the sample
out of the lab.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.970
l got a few hairs
from Wade's comb.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:29.040
And-

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:32.519
and l couldn't get the sample
back into the evidence room.

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:40.790
- And l thought me and Coogan

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.728
were the most fucked-up two
in this room.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.097
- Don't you realize that you
helped kill these people?

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.570
How could you not
tell us this before?

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:53.608
[clock ticking]

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:06.512
- Look, if the truth ever gets
out of this room, l'm over.

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.578
l'll lose my job.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.623
l'll go to jail.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.056
l'll never see my son again.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.252
l might as well be dead.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.954
l committed a felony.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.462
- Yeah, welcome to my world.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.090
- You know, l know we're not
a team or a family,

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.292
but we have a child together.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:21.200
Doesn't that mean something?

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.261
- No, he's my son, Jackson,
okay?

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.306
You're not a father.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.340
You'll never be a father.

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.932
You were just a dick, literally.

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.876
You're fucking unbelievable,
Kelley.

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.037
- You're not a father.

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:33.047
- What?

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.082
- No, no, no.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.344
Hear me out for a second.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:38.751
Greeley said that he wasn't
Wade Greeley.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:42.313
- l'm not Wade Greeley.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:47.657
- Did you see how upset he got

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.096
when Kelley tried to use her son
for pity?

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.727
- Do not use your child
as an excuse.

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:55.498
lt pisses me off.

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.635
- l mean,
if it's not really Wade,

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.938
then maybe it's his father.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.138
- Has anybody thought about what
happened to Wade Greeley

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.238
after he went to prison?

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:09.284
[clock ticking]

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.761
- Remember when l said

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:33.707
Wade Greeley going to prison
was the end-all-be-all?

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.470
Well, l could have been wrong.

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:39.881
- Jackson was on to something
a minute ago.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.416
We've been trying to see how
Coogan and l

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:44.112
fit into the time line before
the trial.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:46.017
We weren't thinking
about what happened

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:48.249
after prison.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:53.287
You said that Wade
was in San Quentin.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.091
Did Christian say what prison
he was in?

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.791
- No, but the sick fucker
over there

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.356
said he'd been to a couple
of prisons.

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:01.198
- My travels have
taken me all over,

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.703
including Los Angeles.

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:05.740
More than a few prisons.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.768
- This must mean something.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.108
- Christian couldn't have known
Wade Greeley.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.170
Christian got out of prison

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.877
before Wade Greeley went in.

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.818
But Coogan
knowing Wade Greeley,

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.479
that's a possibility.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.023
- That just leaves me.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:26.027
[clock ticking]

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.062
- Wait, wait!

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.960
We need more time!

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.228
- Why are you here?

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.669
- Look, we think it has
something to do

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:38.729
with what happened to your son
after he went to prison.

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:40.240
- lsn't this what you want?

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:41.970
You want us to think about our
lives

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.102
and our actions and crimes

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.669
and how they've affected
other people?

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:45.975
Well, that's what
we are doing,

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.276
and it's killing us.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:50.511
- Look, no one has suffered
like you and your son.

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:51.917
Okay, no one here was on trial.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.478
No one here was punished
for their crimes.

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.616
We've just gone on with our
lives and never looked back.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:10:00.890
But you have to look back
every single day.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.555
Look, you asked Sully
if he would change,

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.155
knowing what he's done.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.224
Well, l guarantee,
you ask anyone in this room now,

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:07.929
and we would change.

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.129
We would change for the better.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.730
- Now, speak for yourself,
kiss-ass.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.540
Kiss my ass.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:21.106
- You could have died finding
some humanity or humility.

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.174
- l'd rather go out in style.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.956
[gunshot]

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:35.263
[laughing]

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:54.750
[door creaking and slamming]

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.151
[door creaking and slamming]

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.189
[clock ticking]

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:07.022
- Maybe we do deserve to die.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.030
- l just wish l knew why.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.862
- What, you two are ready
to give up?

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.664
You're both ready to die?

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.102
Well, fuck you both.

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.435
Okay, never give up.

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:19.872
l've lived through
worse than this,

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.000
and l'll live through this.

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.373
- Worse than this, Kelley?

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:25.072
What could possibly be
worse than this?

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:26.842
- Well, back when you and l
were still dating,

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:30.646
l was stupid enough in this day
and age

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:33.279
to think that l could walk
to my car

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:36.950
alone at night.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:42.123
Some sweaty, bald-headed bastard
grabbed me from behind

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:46.395
and threw me in his van.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.368
He bashed my head
on the steel flooring.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.404
l was dazed, but l could see

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.769
that there was already
blood there.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.865
This wasn't his first time.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:12:00.109
He put his hand over my face
as he ripped my clothes off.

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:07.211
lt's like my-my brain didn't
really register the pain.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.383
l just kept thinking

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:13.189
about how l was gonna
get this guy,

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.526
this thing, you know.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.565
And l was gonna put him away
for the rest of his life.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:18.930
l kept imagining the courtroom

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.198
and how l would be looking into
his eyes, and l would say,

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:25.707
''l'm the one
that ruined your life.''

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:30.302
But then l realized we weren't
in a courtroom.

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:33.974
There was no judge,
no jury.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.210
lt was just me and this
shit head who thought he could

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.379
put his hands all over me.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.788
Who the fuck was this guy
to violate me, to take my life?

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.827
What right did he have
to touch me?

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:52.093
l wasn't scared.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.259
l was furious.

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.860
- Why didn't you tell me,
Kelley?

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:57.428
We could have done something
about that.

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.303
- You could have searched
everywhere.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.366
You never would have found him.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:05.937
When he was done,
he rolled off me,

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:10.075
and l saw that there was
a baseball bat in his van.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:13.644
And l grabbed it,
and l hit him hard.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:19.160
Then l stepped back,
thinking someone must have seen,

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.492
someone must have heard.

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.155
And as l waiting for someone to
come help me,

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.565
l hit him again.

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.296
And then l hit him again.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.860
And l just kept swinging.

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.270
And he just kept screaming.

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.330
You know, and he begged.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.376
He begged.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:35.842
Can you believe that?

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:38.539
l swear, l think that made me
hit him harder.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.947
And then-

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.781
and then he just
stopped screaming.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.083
He stopped moving.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:50.319
And l looked around again,

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:54.158
and still no one was there.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.390
[sniffling]

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.432
No one heard.

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.399
No one cared.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:04.838
So l went home,
and l cleaned up,

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:09.105
and l burned the bat
in my fireplace.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:11.874
And l just went on with my life
like that.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.211
lt was just over.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.547
And the next day when they found
his body,

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:22.818
l made sure no one went looking
for his killer.

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:27.089
And now l'm here.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:29.096
And l promise you,
l promise you,

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:30.290
l will live through this,

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:34.358
and l will survive at all-
at all costs.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:44.412
[clock ticking]

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.979
- What about rape?

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.247
We all heard Coogan.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.720
He didn't care if it was boys
or girls.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.484
And if he was in the same prison
with Wade,

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.717
why not a 20-year-old kid?

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:02.925
- We did this to him.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.364
- How could l have known
what was gonna happen to him?

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:09.097
- Think about Wade Greeley,
an innocent kid

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.162
and all the things
he went through.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.731
And think about his father

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:17.245
having to think about
what happened to his son.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.779
Think about that.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.077
- When Coogan was shot,

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.639
when Greeley came in here
and shot him,

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.844
what did Coogan say?

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.216
- l don't remember.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.584
- What are you thinking?

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:29.852
- He said something about
a splatter and killing everyone

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:31.586
or something like that.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.187
- Maybe you should move them
out of the way of the splatter.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.095
l'd hate to see somebody die

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.429
before you get a chance
to kill 'em yourself.

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.332
- Yeah, he was being
a smart-ass.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.734
He was talking about the bullet,

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:45.932
if it went through him
and killed somebody else.

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:47.635
- l thought the same thing.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.677
But what if that's not
what he meant?

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.576
What if the joke
was about something else?

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.576
His blood, for instance.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.141
His infected blood.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.584
What if Coogan had AlDS?

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.383
- Whoa, that's a big stretch,
Eddie.

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.889
- Not really.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:07.224
That's the final piece
of our time line.

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.264
lt starts with Christian
borrowing money from Sully.

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.298
- l know you.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.730
- Says you.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.598
- No, we did some business
together years ago.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.036
- But then he loses that money
after a bad drug deal

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.936
and ends up in jail.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:19.974
When he gets released,

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.476
he buys a gun from Leon,

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.205
uses it to rob Chan's
liquor store,

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.678
'cause he still owes Sully
the money.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:29.183
Then Chan picks Wade Greeley
out of the lineup.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.583
Kelley makes sure the evidence
fits her case

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.553
and uses Jackson to secure
that evidence

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:36.352
against Wade for the trial.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.485
Father Francis learns the truth
during confession

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.688
but being bound by God,
says nothing.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.957
So Wade ends up in prison

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:49.265
where he has a run-in
with Coogan.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.771
And that's how l'm tied
into all this.

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:53.137
- So why are you here?

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:56.666
- Back around the time when Wade

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:58.610
would have been released
from prison,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.443
my company had acquired
the exclusive rights

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.075
to an experimental drug therapy
for AlDS patients.

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:06.052
lt was said to prolong the life

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:09.386
of people living with AlDS.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.221
lt was very new expensive.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.523
l think Coogan infected
Wade Greeley with AlDS.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.222
And the reason Wade's dad waited
two years

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.060
is because that's exactly how
long his son lived

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.999
outside of prison
before he died.

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:24.232
- lt's his father
acting out revenge

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.639
for the death of his son.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:30.439
- Wade must have been one
of the applicants

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.810
for the new AlDS drug.

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:36.749
Part of my job was
to turn down applicants.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.547
lmproper insurance,
not enough money,

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.249
wrong age, and criminal records.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.586
l was the one whose
name was signed

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.560
to all letters
denying applicants.

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.619
lf l had accepted Wade
into the program,

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:51.894
he might be alive today.

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.229
That's it.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.928
That's the answer
he's looking for.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.972
[clock ticking]

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.113
[door creaking]

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.683
- So why are you here?

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.519
- Because your son died of AlDS.

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:19.151
He contracted it in prison
from Coogan.

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.626
When he was released,

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.563
you tried to get him into my
company's drug therapy program,

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:24.929
but they-

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.367
l turned him down.

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.132
Your son could be alive today

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:34.767
if we all hadn't turned our
backs on him and on you.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:40.678
- He was so, so beautiful.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:05.402
My son was a very brave
and lovely boy.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:06.634
And all of you made sure

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:09.233
that he would never grow up
to be a man.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:12.075
lt didn't have to end this way.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:15.913
Any one of you could have
prevented his death.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:21.012
But you all saw him as a suspect
or a number,

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.647
a toy to be played with.

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:27.428
His only fault

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:32.126
was that he became
a part of your lives.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.499
But it was his life.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.470
And you destroyed it.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.335
When we-

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:48.747
when we leave here,
my life will end,

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:52.344
but you will all
still have yours.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.753
And l want you to remember,
just remember this.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:59.851
Remember what it is you have
done.

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:06.527
And l hope that it haunts you
until the day you die.

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.874
Show's over.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:15.273
The police are already here.

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.367
They're in the building.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:20.676
Unlock yourself
and the other two.

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.979

- What are you doing?
He was letting us go!

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.094
- l told you l couldn't have
anyone go to the police

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.133
with my story.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.168
l'd be ruined.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.135
Survive at all costs, remember?

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:43.228
- So you're going to kill him?

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.432
- You're never gonna get away,

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.975
no matter what you do.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.442
- You don't get to make
any more decisions.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:50.637
You don't get to do
or say anything.

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:53.772

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:54.816

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:55.872
- l can't take this anymore!

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.419
Just get me
the hell out of here.

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.783
- Kelley, look.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.550
lt's time for us to leave.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.887
Just calm down,
and we can all go home together.

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:04.926
Kelley, we survived.

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.756
Together we can do this.

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.386
We have a child together.
Come on.

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.556
- l can't have anyone know
what l've done, Jackson.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.599
- She's gonna kill us!

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:12.997
- Shut up, Eddie!

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.035
Let me handle this!

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.501
- Shut up, Eddie!

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.537
- No, no, look!

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:17.572

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:33.855
You've lost.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.355
- Oh, l haven't lost.

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:37.789

the whole time.

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.884
See, everybody's been watching.

You don't know
what l'm capable of.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.438

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.480
Good luck.

Come on, this way, this way.
