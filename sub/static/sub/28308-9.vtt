You got that boom-shaka-laka.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Will Q mansplain his way out of this one?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
There's nothing better after a long day of menstruating

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
than to have some chocolate.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000

Today, we're at the Mall at Bay Plaza hooking people up.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The goal is to get two complete strangers

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
together by getting one potential mate

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
to go over to the other potential mate.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
If you can't get the two lovebirds together, you lose.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Love is in the air.

No, I think that's rain, actually.

sitting over there alone.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I sensed her energy.

I've been in the matchmaking business for two decades now.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000

Alright. So, the "F" stands for "F me."

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Got it. It's okay. I tried.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm just trying to, you know...

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
between this table and the gentleman over there.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I think that it's worth at least him saying hello to you.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
What do you say? You want to just let him say hi for a sec?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Send him over? Oh! There you go!

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So, the girl in the green back there senses the energy.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
She said, "Tell him to come over, absolutely."

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I should go over? Go over. Say hello.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
If nothing comes of it, you walk away.

It's no big deal. I'm telling you.
