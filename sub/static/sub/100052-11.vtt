00:15.058 --> 00:17.060
He'll be out of surgery soon,
and then we'll know more.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
What is the doctor saying?Uh, nothing at the moment,

00:19.236 --> 00:20.803
but I'll get you an update
as soon as I can.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.152
Just please hold
tight, Father.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.067
What happened?An attack of some kind.

00:24.111 --> 00:27.027
The police don't know yet.
They thought maybe

00:27.070 --> 00:28.550
a mugging, but
nothing's been taken.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.769
Oh.
David put up a
fight. He, uh...

00:30.813 --> 00:32.380
You two don't have to stay.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.425
I can call you
if anything changes.
BEN:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.774
We got this.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.211
Do you know who would
have done this?

00:37.907 --> 00:39.778
I'm not sure.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.302
[phone buzzing]

00:41.345 --> 00:42.781

[indistinct P.A. announcement]

00:46.568 --> 00:48.178
I don't think
it's a mugging.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.093
No. Too many crazies
threatening him.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.226
We should talk
to the cop.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.662
Oh, God.
What?

00:53.705 --> 00:55.881
It's Detective Leder.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.405
I know him
from the court.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.406
He's an idiot.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.364
What are you doing?

01:00.408 --> 01:01.887
I need to ask a favor.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.933
[elevator bell dings]

01:07.502 --> 01:09.286
Thanks.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.548
How's he doing?

01:10.592 --> 01:12.463
Well, sounds like
the surgery was successful,

01:12.507 --> 01:13.986
but he's in a lot of pain.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.727
This is the priest
from your house?

01:15.771 --> 01:18.600
Yeah, the priest
in training.

01:18.643 --> 01:19.905
Ah.

Hey, Detective,
I got it from here.

01:29.828 --> 01:32.004
Good luck.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.485
Did he question you?

01:34.529 --> 01:35.747
Not yet.
Just the paramedics.

01:35.791 --> 01:36.531
Did David have any enemies?

01:36.574 --> 01:37.923
Yes.
Who?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.535
Leland Townsend.How do I know that name?

01:40.578 --> 01:42.972
He's a forensic psychologist,
works with the D.A.?

01:43.015 --> 01:44.321
And he's an enemy?
Yes.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.584
Okay. Anybody else?

01:46.628 --> 01:49.021
Um, well, David's work,

01:49.065 --> 01:51.937
or our work,
brings us into the circle

01:51.981 --> 01:53.809

Ill as in...?

Psychopathic.
Who's Ghana?

01:59.249 --> 02:01.164
Ghana?Ghana.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.732
The country?The report says the EMT
heard David saying "Ghana"

02:03.775 --> 02:05.647
over and over as
he was brought in.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.605
Ghana--
that's an old case.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.172
Who are you?I'm Ben Shakir.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.956
Ben works...I work on David's team.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.610
And what was
this case?

02:12.654 --> 02:14.569
Well, six months ago, um,

02:14.612 --> 02:17.006
there was a coder
who tried to kill himself.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.051
His, uh, roommate thought
he was possessed.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.837
And "Ghana" was his
first name, last name?Last.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.839
Richard Ghana.You have an address?

02:23.882 --> 02:27.234
No, but could
probably get one.

02:27.277 --> 02:30.062
Description?Tall, Caucasian,
you know, looked

02:30.106 --> 02:31.586
like a bad gym teacher.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.805
Any reason that he'd
want to attack Acosta?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.459
I don't know.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.157
Okay, I'm going
to the scene.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.636
I'll be back.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.464
Thanks, Mira.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.336
So was this a
possession case?

02:42.379 --> 02:44.207
I mean, I wasn't
that involved in it,

02:44.251 --> 02:46.992
but David thought it was,
and Judy didn't, so...

02:47.036 --> 02:48.559
Who's Judy?

02:48.603 --> 02:50.648
Oh, she... she was you.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.259
Before you.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.869
M-Me before me?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.653
Well, what does that mean?

02:55.697 --> 02:58.482
She was the psychologist
on the team

02:58.526 --> 03:00.267

really itches.

squeaky shoes.

Yes.

Watch out for her.

The squeaky shoes.

David.

We got to stick
together, David.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.472
Most black patients die
in hospitals from...

accidents.

Bleeding out internally,

05:46.650 --> 05:49.349
complications after
surgery, infections.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.699
But it's not random.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.484
It's because of nurses
like Plague.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.268
They torture
and kill us.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.053
And then
she collects

our hospital wristbands
as trophies.

Linda.

I know your throat hurts.

That's from the endotracheal
tube during surgery.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.732
I need you to sip water.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.734
Thank you.

And you should be...

talking non-stop by tomorrow.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.045
Good.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.873
There's a lot of people
who need me tonight,

07:18.916 --> 07:20.570
so I'm a little rushed.

07:20.614 --> 07:24.008
I need to turn you on your side
to avoid decubitus ulcers.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.532
Do you understand?

07:25.575 --> 07:27.272
Mm-hmm.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.491
You may feel this a little.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.058
[groans loudly]

07:30.101 --> 07:31.538
I know. I'm so sorry.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.501
This is an epidural, David.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.111
It's for the pain.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.723
Just count down from five.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.507
[strained]:
Five.

David, can you hear me?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.647
[monitor beeping steadily]

07:57.694 --> 08:00.567
[echoing]:
David.

08:03.134 --> 08:06.964
Good. I thought
I lost you there for a second.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.400
David, can you tell me,

08:08.444 --> 08:10.533
on a scale of one to ten,
your pain level?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.883
[stronger voice]:
Nine.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.538
It's a good thing
you're not German.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.627
I would think you were
just saying "no."

08:20.238 --> 08:21.631
[chuckles]

08:24.373 --> 08:25.635
David,

08:25.679 --> 08:28.029
this is a gel ball.
It's to exercise your hand.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
You had some pretty bad
nerve damage.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.859
Can you grab it for me?

08:31.902 --> 08:34.165
Go on.
You can grab it.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.558
Good.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.213
Now can you squeeze it
for me three times?

08:40.171 --> 08:41.651
One.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.566
Good.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.785
Two.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.004
Come on. You can do it.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.006
[grunts]

08:49.050 --> 08:51.269
[groans, pants]

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
That's fine.

08:54.621 --> 08:58.233
I'll leave it with you, and you
just do the best you can, okay?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.498
[squeaky footsteps retreating]

09:02.542 --> 09:04.674
[door opens, closes]

09:04.718 --> 09:06.023
David?

09:08.373 --> 09:10.288
She wrote a "2" on your board.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.552
You said your pain level
was nine, but she wrote a two.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.379
She does that
all the time

09:14.423 --> 09:16.904
so she can control
the painkillers.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.732
And she drugs us
to shut us up.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.125
If you don't believe me,
just ask... Well...

09:25.695 --> 09:27.654
What are we talking about,
Harlan?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.351
Nothing.No.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.832
You were saying something
to David. Go on. What was it?

09:31.875 --> 09:35.270
I was just saying
I hope he feels better.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.315
Yeah, I hope
he feels better, too.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.796
Maybe you can help
by not telling him stories.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.235
David, what is your pain level?

09:44.279 --> 09:45.715
[monitor beeping]

09:45.759 --> 09:47.369
Bad.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.719
Okay. Let's work on that.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.637
Count back from five, David.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.074
Five.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.599
[whooshing,
high-pitched drone]

10:31.935 --> 10:33.850
Hi.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.461
Hey.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.725
You have a question?

10:38.768 --> 10:41.815
I... I do.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.556
Should I be afraid here?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.735
Anyone with God doesn't need
to be afraid.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.825
But I don't know
if God is with me.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.697
He is. He's there.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.657
Where? I don't see him.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.877
David, you have to remember
