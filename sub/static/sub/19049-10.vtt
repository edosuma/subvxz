WEBVTT

00:01.704 --> 00:03.643
So like you said, when
you come face-to-face with

00:03.711 --> 00:05.679
something like that, what
are you supposed to do?

00:06.481 --> 00:08.648
Oof!

00:08.716 --> 00:10.083
Oh, hey, buddy.

00:10.151 --> 00:12.052
Yeah, what's
going on there, pal?

00:12.120 --> 00:14.988
Oh, my God, I
just found a rat's nest.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.824
Slaughtered about 200 of 'em.

00:17.892 --> 00:22.028
200? Couldn't be. That's...
Jesus Christ...

00:22.096 --> 00:24.998
Oh, it's like, it's like
whole generations of those

00:25.066 --> 00:29.436
things have died at my hands, and...

00:29.504 --> 00:32.339
mothers, fathers, grandfathers,
little baby rats.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.440
Mmm, yeah.

00:33.508 --> 00:34.508
Wow.

00:34.575 --> 00:37.778
Well, you know, keep up the good work.

00:37.845 --> 00:39.374
Yeah.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.054
Sometimes I wonder though, if

00:43.442 --> 00:46.253
our lives are really more valuable
than theirs, you know what I mean?

00:46.320 --> 00:47.587
Yeah.
They are.

00:47.655 --> 00:48.255
Yeah.

00:48.322 --> 00:51.424
Our lives are definitely...
Yeah. without a doubt.

00:51.492 --> 00:52.959
Yeah.
Without a doubt.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.329
If that makes you feel any better.

00:56.397 --> 00:57.531
Mm-hmm.

00:57.598 --> 01:01.401
Yeah, well, I suppose I oughta...
Get back to it?

01:01.469 --> 01:03.870
Yep. Jump right back
in there, tiger.

01:03.938 --> 01:04.771
Get on the horse.

01:04.839 --> 01:06.173
Charlie, bash, bash 'em up.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.507
Do what you do best.
All right. Thanks, guys.

01:07.575 --> 01:08.975
Yep. Oh, God.

01:09.043 --> 01:10.944
I just gotta go to the bathroom.

01:11.012 --> 01:12.479
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, man.

01:12.547 --> 01:13.580
He touched me with it.

01:13.648 --> 01:15.582
Ugh! God, what a life, huh?

01:15.650 --> 01:17.417
Today's his birthday.
Are you kidding me?

01:17.485 --> 01:19.452
Poor guy, on a day like this.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.987
We oughta do something nice for him.

01:21.055 --> 01:22.389
Mm-hmm. Definitely.
Yeah, absolutely.

01:22.456 --> 01:24.558
Oh! You want to get
him a new rat stick?

01:24.625 --> 01:25.559
That's a good idea.

01:25.626 --> 01:28.728
Abso... I was thinking maybe we
should throw him a surprise party.

01:28.796 --> 01:29.629
He is really bummed.

01:29.697 --> 01:31.565
I guess we could do
something nice for him.

01:31.632 --> 01:34.868
Definitely. Listen, for one day let's
make the poor bastard feel special.

01:34.936 --> 01:38.839
For one day let's make this lowly
rat killer feel like a king.

01:38.906 --> 01:39.706
Yes.

01:39.774 --> 01:43.343
In the simplest... Easiest...
way. ...easiest.

01:43.411 --> 01:45.345
I'm tired today, you know?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.950
Here it is. I got it!

02:20.070 --> 02:23.103
I'm thinking we go with a
Hawaiian

02:23.223 --> 02:25.732
trip-hop, underground

02:25.852 --> 02:27.582
- Huh?
- What is that?

02:27.702 --> 02:29.065
- What even is that?
- Well, you know...

02:29.185 --> 02:31.989
I'll even hang around with this guy
Duncan from under the bridge....

02:32.109 --> 02:34.151
And he runs with this rough crowd

02:34.271 --> 02:35.559
and they're ll into

02:35.679 --> 02:38.224
Hawaiian underground shit, you know?

02:38.225 --> 02:41.928
And I made a little list of stuff
that would really support that theme.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.163
"Fill bar with sand.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.699
Roast wild pig.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.966
Invite Duncan and crew."

02:47.034 --> 02:50.337
Ooh, this seems like
a whole lot of work.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.306
Uh, does anybody really even
like surprise parties anyway?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.708
You know?
I don't.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.376
What the hell's the matter with you?!

02:56.444 --> 02:58.411
How did you get so cynical?
Cynical?

02:58.479 --> 03:01.014
You can't even get excited
to give your friend a party!

03:01.082 --> 03:04.918
I mean, giving somebody a
birthday party, a surprise party

03:04.985 --> 03:07.487
is one of the greatest
things you can do for him!

03:07.555 --> 03:09.389
Okay, Frank.
All right.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.625
All right, all right, well, maybe
we are being a little cynical.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.894
Clearly, this means a
lot to you, so, fine.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.930
We'll jump on board with the party.
What's the plan?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.998
All right, the plan is you
guys execute this list.

03:19.066 --> 03:19.699
Mm-hmm.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.536
I am gonna take Charlie to the
spa for a day to distract him.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.504
Hold on a second.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.607
Why do you get to spend the day at
a spa while we do all the legwork?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.043
Because I got these two
coupons in the mail.

03:30.111 --> 03:32.445
Okay, I'm pregnant, and you
haven't offered me coupons or

03:32.513 --> 03:35.749
spa days or roasted pigs or
surprises or any-any of those

03:35.816 --> 03:37.117
fun things.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.053
Oh, oh, okay, well, in the
interest of not being cynical

03:40.121 --> 03:42.989
and, you know, doing shit for
other people, I'm gonna suggest

03:43.057 --> 03:44.958
that we give the two coupons to

03:45.025 --> 03:47.360
<i>Dee and she does the spa thing.</i>

03:47.428 --> 03:49.195
Surprise. Perfect.
Thank you.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.330
All right, cool.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.967
I will take this coupon and sneak out
the back so Charlie doesn't see me.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.569
Wait, wait.
What, what? What?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.772
No, you have to take Charlie
with you to the spa.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.407
That's the whole thing.
You have to distract him.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.508
Oh... shit.

04:01.575 --> 04:05.211
Yeah, Frank, you might be right
about us getting cynical.

04:05.279 --> 04:08.281
I just, I just jumped straight
to default and was gonna throw

04:08.349 --> 04:09.749
this second coupon in the trash.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.552
But the Charlie thing, yep,
we're doing the Charlie thing.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.988
Okay, I got it. I'm on it.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.089
Okay.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.327
Hey, Charlie!

04:21.394 --> 04:24.497
Okay, hey, listen, uh, you've
been really stressed, so I

04:24.565 --> 04:27.200
thought I would take you for
a spa day, just you and me.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.768
A what day?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.069
A spa day.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.037
What is this word "spa"?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.706
I feel like you're starting to say a
word, and you're not finishing it.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.141
Are you trying to say "spaghetti"?

04:35.209 --> 04:36.976
Are you taking me for a spaghetti day?

04:37.044 --> 04:40.513
No, Charlie, I wasn't trying to
take you for a spaghetti day.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.581
Oh, God, you know what?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.116
It doesn't matter. It's okay.
That's all right.

04:43.184 --> 04:44.751
I'm doing something nice here.
I tell you what.

04:44.819 --> 04:46.920
Let's go to a movie.
Want to go to a movie?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.567
Dee, I go to movie or
a spaghetti place with you

04:49.687 --> 04:51.135
you know and ***?

04:51.255 --> 04:52.843
What if I guarantee you

04:52.963 --> 04:53.922
 that
nobody out there will put you

04:53.961 --> 04:56.129
into a bag and bash you
against a telephone pole?

04:56.197 --> 04:57.363
Would that comfort you at all?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.571
Nope. That's a guarantee you
can't make, Dee, all right?

04:59.633 --> 05:02.268
All right, I tell you what...
That's why I'm building this little puppy.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.970
Yeah. Don't do...
And no one's getting bashed.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.472
Okay, I tell you what, Charlie.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.774
If you don't come with me to
tho movie, I'm gonna take this

05:07.842 --> 05:10.210
raccoon of yours and I'm gonna
bash it into a telephone pole.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.245
No! I can't take any more
bashing today, all right?

05:12.313 --> 05:13.413
Okay, let's go, let's go.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.070
This will be fun!
All right, let's go.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.253
Dennis.
Yeah?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.589
Why don't you check that box of tiki
torches, start setting those up?

05:22.709 --> 05:25.191
What this?
Yeah, that box there.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.359
What is this?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.827
We didn't put this in here.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.862
Surprise!

05:28.929 --> 05:30.196
What is that? What'd you do?

05:30.264 --> 05:31.464
I got you a present, bro!

05:31.532 --> 05:33.800
I'm trying to be less cynical,
and Frank is totally right.

05:33.868 --> 05:35.668
The surprise is the way to go!

05:35.736 --> 05:36.736
So you got me a gift?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.838
Yes! Yeah, while we were
picking out the decorations, I

05:38.906 --> 05:41.941
slipped out and I got you something
I think you're gonna gonna like.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.910
Okay, all right. Ooh!
Ooh! Okay. Uh!

05:43.978 --> 05:46.212
Ah!

05:46.280 --> 05:48.615
Oh! Oh, a shirt!

05:48.682 --> 05:49.816
I love this shirt!

05:49.884 --> 05:50.917
Oh, that's great, man!

05:50.985 --> 05:51.951
Thank you.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.254
Hey. No, this isn't the
shirt that I picked out.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.222
Yeah. No. Well, no.
What is this?

05:56.290 --> 05:58.324
It's the shirt that I...
that I picked out.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.392
But that's cool.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.760
Here's the thing, man.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.863
I-I got a little suspicious
when you slipped out earlier,

06:03.931 --> 06:07.100
and so I followed you into the
store, and I saw that you were

06:07.167 --> 06:09.536
about to make a really bad
choice, and then you did make

06:09.603 --> 06:12.438
that choice and you bought that other
shirt, and it was a bad shirt.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.907
It was an ugly shirt.
Hideous really.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.509
So I grabbed that shirt out
of the bag when you weren't

06:16.577 --> 06:18.678
looking and I returned it and
bought myself this shirt

06:18.746 --> 06:19.946
which isn't hideous.

06:20.014 --> 06:21.247
And so, surprise.

06:21.315 --> 06:22.549
That was a good shirt.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.983
No.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.053
This brings me no joy at all.
I feel nothing.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.355
I feel...
I feel like you just, you stole

06:29.423 --> 06:31.758
money from me, and then you
bought yourself a shirt.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.159
A shirt with your money.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.193
Yeah.

06:34.295 --> 06:35.428
No, that is what happened.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.199
That is a ridiculous
price and you know it!

06:40.267 --> 06:44.003
Supposing I bought a pig unseasoned
and dressed it it myself?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.405
Then what? What then?!

06:45.472 --> 06:50.543
Well, that's not what Jerry
Carelli said, asshole!

06:50.611 --> 06:53.413
Ha! Pitting two pig dealers
against each other.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.681
Ah, sure.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.849
Frank, are you sure
about this luau thing?

06:56.917 --> 06:57.850
I mean, it's a ton of work.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.019
Yeah. Does Charlie even
know what a luau is?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.522
I doubt Charlie can even
say the word "luau."

07:02.590 --> 07:04.808
I mean, how do you know that's
what he wants?

07:04.928 --> 07:06.951
Because I read it in his dreambook.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.216
In his what? His dreambook?

07:09.336 --> 07:12.298
Yeah. Charlie keeps a book
of dreams and aspirations.

07:12.366 --> 07:16.436
They're mostly in pictures
and symbols, but he has been

07:16.503 --> 07:20.673
obsessing about this luau thing since
we met Duncan under the bridge.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.342
Okay, now, my first instinct:

07:22.409 --> 07:25.044
When you say things about
meeting people under bridges,

07:25.112 --> 07:27.380
it's to, it's to berate you
for hanging out with people

07:27.448 --> 07:29.253
under a bridge and to say to
you, "Why do you hang out with

07:29.373 --> 07:31.625
these... with these people?
You and Charlie shouldn't be..."

07:32.101 --> 07:35.388
But I'm not gonna say anything because
I don't want to be cynical anymore.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.389
I'm not going to say anything.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.725
I'm just...
Maybe the bridge is exciting.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.393
No.
The bridge is awesome.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.894
Ooh.
It's probably pretty cool.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.397
Hold on a second. Hold.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.766
Hey, it's the other pig guy.

07:46.834 --> 07:52.939
Ah, so you come crawling back,
you cheap sack of shit.

07:59.027 --> 08:00.561
Oh, you can't bring food into the theater.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.660
No, I'm not. I bought it over there
with that food.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.439
- No, you didn't.
- How do you know that?

08:07.559 --> 08:09.575
Because we don't serve spaghetti...

08:09.695 --> 08:11.528
and I just watched you walk in with it.

08:11.648 --> 08:14.834
You call my bluff, sir.
I shall dispose of this ***

08:14.954 --> 08:15.887
A moment, please.

08:15.955 --> 08:18.623
Dee, do me a favor and pop
this in your purse real quick.

08:18.691 --> 08:19.624
No, absolutely not.

08:19.692 --> 08:21.059
No. Why do you have to
bring spaghetti...?

08:21.127 --> 08:22.427
You caught me hankering for
spaghetti and I want it.

08:22.495 --> 08:23.795
Just eat it, then.
Eat it fast and we'll go.

08:23.863 --> 08:25.163
No, I want to enjoy it
and watch the movie.

08:25.231 --> 08:26.631
It's going to make a mess in my purse.

08:26.699 --> 08:28.767
I'm leaving because the spaghetti
is the whole deal for me.

08:28.835 --> 08:30.836
Goddamn it. Just... Goddamn it.
Just put it in. Be careful.

08:30.903 --> 08:32.370
You are... this is so stupid.

08:32.438 --> 08:33.605
And there we go!

08:33.673 --> 08:35.506
Got rid of it.
Great. Thank you.

08:35.575 --> 08:36.908
Okay.
Look at this place, Dee.

08:36.976 --> 08:38.727
Look at the size of the place.

08:40.546 --> 08:41.913
What does 3-D even stand for?

08:41.981 --> 08:43.414
Third dimension.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.649
Just... please stop talking.

08:44.717 --> 08:47.352
Third dimen...
What dimension are we in?

08:47.420 --> 08:48.520
Shh! Charlie, I don't know.

08:48.588 --> 08:49.521
Shh!

08:49.589 --> 08:51.790
Isn't stuff, like,
supposed to pop out at us?

08:51.858 --> 08:52.791
I don't know. I'm not sure.

08:52.859 --> 08:54.693
Let's watch and find out, okay?
Whoa!

08:55.595 --> 08:56.728
Did you see that?

08:56.796 --> 08:58.296
Yeah. Yeah, I saw that.

08:58.364 --> 09:00.098
That came, like, right at you.

09:00.166 --> 09:00.766
Is this safe?

09:00.833 --> 09:01.867
Are you kidding me?

09:01.934 --> 09:02.868
I don't know.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.870
Take the glasses off if
you're uncomfortable, okay?

09:04.937 --> 09:06.738
But then everything's, like, blurry.

09:06.806 --> 09:08.607
Then put the glasses
on and shut the hell up.

09:08.674 --> 09:09.941
Shh!
You shh!

09:10.009 --> 09:11.309
See, then, stuff's not safe.

09:11.377 --> 09:12.377
Uh-oh.

09:12.445 --> 09:13.578
Whoa.

09:13.646 --> 09:15.947
What happened to my meatball?

09:16.015 --> 09:16.948
Hey, would you shut up?

09:17.016 --> 09:18.917
Oh, no, you know what happened?
When I...

09:18.985 --> 09:21.052
I bet if flew off when I...
Okay, you are a sleuth.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.788
You've gotten to the bottom of it.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.122
That's very exciting.
Now shut up.

09:24.190 --> 09:24.790
Let me just find it.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.858
I'm sorry, did you see a meatball...
Charlie, sit down.

09:26.926 --> 09:27.526
Oh, my God, Charlie.

09:27.593 --> 09:29.194
I swear to God, if you don't sit
down and shut up and watch the

09:29.262 --> 09:30.195
movie, I'm going to attack you.

09:30.263 --> 09:32.197
I don't care how pregnant I am,
I am going to get out of this

09:32.265 --> 09:33.198
seat, I'm going to attack you.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.200
I got it, got it, got it...
Oh, you got it? Okay, good.

09:35.268 --> 09:36.201
Sit down.

09:36.269 --> 09:37.869
Got the meatball.
Sit down!

09:37.937 --> 09:39.871
Quiet down!
The movie's boring.

09:39.939 --> 09:40.539
You... You...!

09:40.606 --> 09:43.508
How could you...
You're not watching the movie.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.846
Ugh. Uh-uh.

09:47.914 --> 09:49.681
Aah, you're not gonna like this.

09:49.749 --> 09:50.682
What happened?

09:50.750 --> 09:51.850
Ah, nuts.

09:51.918 --> 09:54.686
Some-some spaghetti kind of like
spilled in your purse a little bit.

09:54.754 --> 09:56.054
Oh, shit.
Want your spaghetti, Charlie?

09:56.122 --> 09:57.389
Want your spaghetti?
Here's your spaghetti.

09:57.456 --> 09:59.424
Oh, don't dump it on
the ground like that.

09:59.492 --> 10:00.826
Shut up and watch the movie.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.627
I don't want to shut up
and watch the movie.

10:02.695 --> 10:04.462
Can't eat spaghetti,
can't follow the movie.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.897
Doesn't make sense.
I'm going back to the bar.

10:05.965 --> 10:06.598
Good. Good. Go to the bar.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.033
I'm taking the spaghetti with me.
Excuse me.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.034
Are you kidding me?

10:09.101 --> 10:11.369
Are you kidding me?

10:14.440 --> 10:16.007
Dude, I just saw another rat.

10:16.075 --> 10:16.741
Yeah, I know.

10:16.809 --> 10:18.276
There's definitely a ton of
rats in here, that's for sure.

10:18.344 --> 10:20.212
I see him! I see him!
Oh, shit.

10:20.279 --> 10:21.546
We gotta distract him.
Yeah.

10:21.614 --> 10:22.981
I'll tell him the keg exploded.

10:23.049 --> 10:24.649
No, that's a stupid idea.
That's a stupid idea.

10:24.717 --> 10:25.650
We're going with the burst pipe.

10:25.718 --> 10:27.097
Uh, I like the keg idea.

10:27.217 --> 10:28.321
Your idea is so stupid...

10:28.441 --> 10:30.051
Let's go with the burst pipe...

10:30.171 --> 10:31.382
***

10:31.502 --> 10:32.891
Hey, Charlie, Charlie!

10:32.959 --> 10:33.892
Charlie boy!

10:33.960 --> 10:35.961
Hey, where'd you get
those glasses, bud?

10:36.028 --> 10:36.928
Oh, these?

10:36.996 --> 10:38.930
They're just, like, third
dimension glasses, you know?

10:38.998 --> 10:41.633
Don't really work, though,
'cause I feel like I'm still

10:41.701 --> 10:43.768
seeing stuff in whatever
dimension we live in.

10:43.836 --> 10:47.505
Right. Well, listen, um, you can't really
go in the bar right right now, bro.

10:47.573 --> 10:48.273
Why not?

10:48.341 --> 10:49.941
Well, because a keg exploded.

10:50.009 --> 10:50.942
Holy shit. Can that happen?

10:51.010 --> 10:54.312
A piece of metal flew off the keg
and hit Dennis right in the dick.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.680
Holy shit. Are you okay?

10:55.748 --> 10:57.716
Yeah... No, I-I'm fine.

10:57.783 --> 10:58.884
I'm fine. I got lucky.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.418
It mashed right into it.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.254
We all thought he was gonna lose it.

11:02.321 --> 11:04.256
Charlie, it lumped it up and
mangled it like a chicken

11:04.323 --> 11:04.923
potpie down there.

11:04.991 --> 11:06.558
Dickless Dennis.

11:06.626 --> 11:07.993
That's what we should call
him now... Dickless Dennis.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.561
No, no, no.
It's totally fine.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.764
Oh, Dickless Dennis.

11:12.832 --> 11:16.468
Oh, Dick... But it doesn't apply
because my totally went back to

11:16.535 --> 11:17.636
normal, and it's fine now.

11:17.703 --> 11:19.471
I'll show it to you.
I don't want to see it.

11:19.538 --> 11:21.072
Anyway, moving on, how was the spa?

11:21.140 --> 11:22.107
Spa?

11:22.174 --> 11:24.175
Oh, spaghetti?

11:24.243 --> 11:25.210
How's my spaghetti?

11:25.278 --> 11:26.159
Dee threw it on the floor.

11:26.279 --> 11:27.212
No, no, the spa.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.280
The spa that Dee took you to.

11:28.347 --> 11:30.015
Oh, no, she took me to a movie.

11:30.082 --> 11:31.016
Yeah, it was lame.

11:31.083 --> 11:31.783
I couldn't understand it.

11:31.851 --> 11:32.884
Made no sense.

11:33.856 --> 11:35.726
That cynical bitch.

11:37.924 --> 11:40.692
Hello. I would like to redeem
this coupon and go ahead

11:40.760 --> 11:42.060
and toss this one in the trash for me.

11:42.128 --> 11:43.395
Busted!
Ah, see!

11:43.462 --> 11:44.796
Oh, busted, Dee.
You're so busted.

11:44.864 --> 11:46.865
What?
What are you guys doing here?

11:46.933 --> 11:49.901
I'm taking Charlie to the
spa because he's stressed.

11:49.969 --> 11:51.903
A keg exploded in the bar,
blew Dennis's dick off.

11:51.971 --> 11:53.905
No, no...
Oh, it's a mess down there.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.707
No, my...
my dick is fine, Dee.

11:55.775 --> 11:56.708
Let me have those coupons.

11:56.776 --> 11:57.709
No, you said I can have them.

11:57.777 --> 11:59.878
Dee, you were supposed
to take Charlie.

11:59.946 --> 12:01.646
Yeah, I tried to take Charlie,
but he refused to go.

12:01.714 --> 12:04.082
What is your spaghetti policy here?

12:04.150 --> 12:05.317
Are you hearing this?

12:05.384 --> 12:06.284
Are you hearing this?

12:06.352 --> 12:08.253
He doesn't belong in a
place like this, you guys.

12:08.321 --> 12:09.921
All right, come on,
we're wasting time.

12:09.989 --> 12:12.257
Go get Duncan and the the bridge
crew and bring them to the bar.

12:12.325 --> 12:14.292
I'll occupy Charlie.
No.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.962
Where's the robes?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.735
I think this is it, right here.

12:23.803 --> 12:25.337
This is sketchy as hell.

12:26.572 --> 12:27.372
Yeah.

12:32.845 --> 12:35.780
Hey, um, yeah, we're
looking for Duncan.

12:37.917 --> 12:39.217
Oh, let's go.

12:39.285 --> 12:41.486
Oh, yeah, we should take
that as a sign, right?

12:43.489 --> 12:44.708
Yeah. Oh.

12:45.954 --> 12:47.649
Come on.

12:47.769 --> 12:49.609
Yeah?

12:49.729 --> 12:51.696
Hey.

12:51.764 --> 12:55.200
Hey. Hey.

12:55.267 --> 12:57.202
You pregnant.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.009
One more time.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.011
What is happening in here?

13:06.078 --> 13:07.245
I don't know.

13:07.313 --> 13:09.614
Come on, no All right, uh, Mr.
Duncan,

13:09.682 --> 13:11.783
we were wondering if we
could talk to you about...

13:11.851 --> 13:12.650
I ain't no Duncan.

13:12.718 --> 13:15.253
It's this nigga right here about
to go level three and shit.

13:15.321 --> 13:16.254
That's Duncan.

13:16.322 --> 13:17.188
Oh... you're Duncan.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.191
Uh, Mr. Duncan, we were wondering if you
could come to a surprise party for Charlie.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.960
Who?
Charlie.

13:22.028 --> 13:23.094
He's Frank's friend.

13:23.162 --> 13:25.830
It's my understanding you guys have
all been hanging out under a bridge.

13:25.898 --> 13:26.598
Oh, yeah, Frank.

13:26.665 --> 13:27.799
I know that bitch.

13:27.867 --> 13:30.335
Okay, hey, listen, Frank
mentioned that you might be

13:30.403 --> 13:31.803
willing to...
Oh, shit!

13:31.871 --> 13:34.339
Level three, son!
Yeah, level three!

13:34.407 --> 13:37.709
This is bizarre, okay?

13:37.777 --> 13:40.045
Charlie should not have anything
to do with these people.

13:40.079 --> 13:41.679
No.
They are deranged.

13:41.747 --> 13:43.681
You know what? Frank has too
much influence over this whole

13:43.749 --> 13:44.682
thing, all right?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.618
I think we gotta stop and think
about what Charlie wants.

13:46.685 --> 13:48.620
Yeah, I think we need to get
our hands on Charlie's dream

13:48.687 --> 13:50.789
book and we need to figure out
what that kid wants ourselves.

13:51.924 --> 13:52.524
Mother pus bucket.

13:52.591 --> 13:55.827
You piece of shit, you broke my wall!

13:55.895 --> 13:57.662
We have company here.

13:59.065 --> 13:59.931
Should we call the police?

13:59.999 --> 14:01.433
Oh, you know what, let's
just go, let's just go.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.901
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's get the hell out of here.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.570
All right.

14:07.907 --> 14:09.707
Charlie, let's go.

14:09.775 --> 14:10.608
Get in here.

14:10.676 --> 14:12.177
Oh, oh, oh.

14:12.244 --> 14:15.580
Hey, guys, the management needs
everybody to get out, because

14:15.648 --> 14:18.049
they caught a guy jerking off in
here and they're going to send

14:18.117 --> 14:20.251
in a crew to wipe down the loads.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.886
Go ahead, go on, let's go.

14:21.954 --> 14:23.288
God, it's terrible.

14:23.355 --> 14:25.290
It's really disgusting.

14:27.393 --> 14:29.661
Get rid of all the strange dongs.

14:29.728 --> 14:31.162
Ah.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.131
Yeah, a little bit.

14:33.199 --> 14:34.099
I don't get it, man.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.701
What's so relaxing about sitting
around in a hot, wet room?

14:36.769 --> 14:38.403
It's all about opening
up your pores, Charlie.

14:38.471 --> 14:39.170
Yeah.

14:39.238 --> 14:41.172
Yeah, take your robe off.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.841
Yeah, that's it.

14:42.908 --> 14:45.237
You got your clothes on.

14:45.357 --> 14:46.805
- Get your clothes off.
- What? No.

14:46.925 --> 14:48.990
I can't get naked in public.

14:49.110 --> 14:51.549
Suit yourself, alright?

14:52.212 --> 14:54.285
I am gonna roast like a pig.

14:54.405 --> 14:55.873
Ok, I'm gonna eat the spaghetti.

15:00.809 --> 15:02.165
Oh, guys, guys, guys.

15:02.285 --> 15:03.342
Hey, this is it.

15:03.462 --> 15:05.945
Dram... Dram bak...
***

15:06.065 --> 15:08.233
Yeah, look at this...
pictures and symbols.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.502
I don't see anything about
our stupid luau, but, uh...

15:10.569 --> 15:12.036
This looks weird.

15:12.104 --> 15:13.671
What is that?
What do you make of it, guys?

15:13.739 --> 15:19.277
Looks like a drawing of a pair of
jeans, a plus sign and a chicken.

15:19.345 --> 15:21.379
Denim... chicken.

15:21.447 --> 15:23.047
Denim chicken.

15:23.115 --> 15:26.584
Okay, guys, my gut is telling me
to throw this book in the trash.

15:26.652 --> 15:27.952
Well, yeah.
It's absolute nonsense.

15:28.020 --> 15:28.620
Uh-huh.

15:28.687 --> 15:30.622
I think we're all feeling the
same thing, but I think we need

15:30.689 --> 15:31.656
to fight that instinct.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.925
We have to throw a party for Charlie.
It's so simple.

15:33.993 --> 15:35.593
If we can't do that, what
does that say about us?

15:35.661 --> 15:37.128
You're right, you're right.
This isn't about us.

15:37.196 --> 15:38.530
Let's not be cynical.
Let's do what the kid wants.

15:38.597 --> 15:41.966
Yeah. If he wants a worm...
hat... Worm hat.

15:42.034 --> 15:42.634
Worm hat.

15:42.701 --> 15:45.303
Okay, how do we get him a worm hat,
'cause I don't know what that is.

15:45.371 --> 15:47.071
Maybe there's a drawing, or...
What is that?

15:47.139 --> 15:48.740
That's a bird with teeth.
It sure is.

15:48.807 --> 15:50.775
Okay, look, we don't have a
lot of time, so let's just

15:50.843 --> 15:51.743
figure out the best we can do.

15:51.810 --> 15:52.810
We can do it, we can do it.

15:52.878 --> 15:54.279
All right, we'll do these things.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.314
We'll do these things, okay.

16:01.745 --> 16:04.227
Dude, how much longer do
we have to stay in here?

16:04.347 --> 16:05.481
Come on, just relax.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.882
Take your clothes off.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.484
I feel trapped in here, Frank.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.385
Huh?

16:09.452 --> 16:11.720
I'm trapped like a rat.

16:11.788 --> 16:14.490
Holy shit, I'm trapped
like a rat, aren't I?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.392
No, you're not, Charlie.
I'm a rat in here.

16:16.459 --> 16:17.393
I'm a rat!

16:17.460 --> 16:20.095
I'm trapped like a...

16:20.163 --> 16:21.030
I got to get out of here.

16:21.097 --> 16:21.830
Calm down, Charlie.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.433
I'm tired of being in weird places,
Frank, 'cause I'm trapped like a rat.

16:24.501 --> 16:25.934
Calm down, Charlie, calm down.

16:26.002 --> 16:27.269
Relax.
Okay, all right, all right.

16:27.337 --> 16:28.604
I got to get out of here!
Now calm down.

16:28.672 --> 16:29.338
How do I get this off?

16:31.608 --> 16:33.008
Charlie, no, no.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.309
Take it easy, Charlie.

16:34.377 --> 16:35.244
Just bash me, Frank.

16:35.311 --> 16:36.912
No, I'm not going to
bash you, Charlie.

16:36.980 --> 16:37.880
Just bash me like a rat.

16:37.947 --> 16:40.464
Bash me like a rat and get it over with.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.496
Oh, sorry guys.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.442
Just let me know when you're done.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.609
I'm the guy who wipes down the loads.

16:54.130 --> 16:57.032
I'm not wearing the stupid
thing, and that's it.

16:57.100 --> 16:57.933
It's a lei.

16:58.001 --> 16:59.835
Surprise!

16:59.903 --> 17:01.437
What the shit is this?

17:01.504 --> 17:02.471
Where's my luau?

17:02.539 --> 17:04.473
Well, we went around you, Frank.
Yeah.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.973
Happy birthday, Charlie.
Happy birthday.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.309
Happy birthday?

17:07.377 --> 17:11.346
Oh, is that why you guys were doing
all that weird shit with me today?

17:11.414 --> 17:13.682
Yeah. We were trying to distract
you so we could plan your party.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.250
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.

17:15.318 --> 17:16.351
It's not my birthday, though.

17:16.419 --> 17:17.886
Huh?
It's not your birthday?

17:17.954 --> 17:20.756
Nope.
No, dicks, it's my birthday.

17:20.824 --> 17:22.925
What?
Are you kidding me?

17:22.992 --> 17:23.892
No, I'm not kidding you.

17:23.960 --> 17:24.960
Wait, wait a second.

17:25.028 --> 17:28.063
Were you trying to get us to
plan your surprise party?

17:28.131 --> 17:30.265
Why wouldn't you just
plan it yourself?

17:30.333 --> 17:31.300
Well, that's lame.

17:31.367 --> 17:35.370
I mean, this way I get my
surprise party and I give you

17:35.438 --> 17:38.240
the satisfaction of doing
something nice for somebody.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.542
Oh, my God.
That is not doing something nice.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.177
That is tricking us.
Son of a bitch.

17:42.245 --> 17:43.579
Where's Duncan?
Where's Dunc...?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.114
You should not be hanging
out with Duncan.

17:45.181 --> 17:46.682
You should not be associating
people like that.

17:46.750 --> 17:47.783
I'm saying, I don't care.

17:47.851 --> 17:48.817
It's coming out of my mouth.

17:48.885 --> 17:50.786
Those weird bridge
people that are like...?

17:50.854 --> 17:53.455
Yeah. All that, like,
Hawwoowin lauow?

17:53.523 --> 17:55.124
I knew it, I knew he couldn't say it.

17:55.191 --> 17:56.458
Luau, luau.
Luau.

17:56.526 --> 17:57.226
What is it, you know?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.861
I mean, it's the weird...
Hello?

17:58.928 --> 18:00.462
Hang on.
Oh, yeah.

18:00.530 --> 18:02.197
What do we got going
on over here, guys?

18:02.265 --> 18:04.900
Okay, well, Charlie, when we
thought it was your birthday, we

18:04.968 --> 18:06.802
went through your dream book and
we tried to recreate some of the

18:06.870 --> 18:07.703
stuff we found in there.

18:07.771 --> 18:09.972
Yes, that's... okay.

18:10.039 --> 18:12.307
Um... denim chicken?

18:12.375 --> 18:13.242
Yes!

18:13.309 --> 18:14.443
Denim chicken.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.545
Now I got to reroute the pig delivery.

18:16.613 --> 18:17.379
Nobody gives a shit.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.587
Okay.

18:18.654 --> 18:21.389
And I'm assuming the
teeth are fake, yes?

18:21.457 --> 18:24.359
Yes, well, they're not real
human teeth if that's what

18:24.427 --> 18:25.160
you're asking.

18:25.228 --> 18:28.764
No, I mean, did you discover a
bird with teeth in this fashion?

18:28.831 --> 18:31.233
That does not exist in nature.
Okay.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.501
I'm not sure about that.

18:32.568 --> 18:34.069
But either way, good glue work.

18:34.137 --> 18:36.938
Do any of you assholes
want to know how old I am?

18:37.006 --> 18:37.839
Whatever, Frank.

18:37.907 --> 18:40.601
Nobody... All right so...
So, Charlie, this is my favorite part.

18:40.721 --> 18:43.578
We weren't quite sure what
a worm hat was, right?

18:43.646 --> 18:44.780
So we made a few of them.

18:44.847 --> 18:45.947
This is the first one.

18:46.015 --> 18:47.476
It's a hat made of worms, okay?

18:47.596 --> 18:50.584
And then option number two
is a hat that you put on

18:50.836 --> 18:53.133
and if you do that you look
like maybe you're a worm.

18:53.253 --> 18:56.647
Right...And then the third one... and
this is the best one, Charlie...

18:56.767 --> 18:58.994
is a hat for your worm.

18:59.061 --> 19:02.230
Oh, your teeny tiny little worm gets a teeny
tiny little hat. If you want him to be fancy.

19:02.298 --> 19:05.382
So which was is it? Which one were you
talking about? Yeah, who's right?

19:05.502 --> 19:07.258
Well, I don't recall
every writing worm hat.

19:07.378 --> 19:09.177
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was in
your dream book. Your...

19:09.297 --> 19:11.387
Oh, "Wormhat."

19:11.507 --> 19:13.068
Yeah, that's a German guy.

19:13.188 --> 19:15.000
His name is Hans Wormhat.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.121
He appears in my dreams.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.839
He drive a biplane and he shoots it
at me and I run through a field.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.308
You know what, you guys blow.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.176
I'm gonna go find Duncan.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.145
Go, go!
Go!

19:24.213 --> 19:27.415
Guys, wow, the denim chicken,
the bird with teeth,

19:27.482 --> 19:29.317
Wormhat's worm hat.

19:29.384 --> 19:31.285
I mean, I don't know what to say, man.

19:31.353 --> 19:33.254
This is just what I needed today.

19:33.322 --> 19:34.632
Guess what, buddy?
There's one more thing.

19:37.793 --> 19:39.794
Is that what I think it is?

19:39.861 --> 19:41.762
That's a new rat stick, dude.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.198
And you can bash up a whole
bunch of rats with one quick

19:44.266 --> 19:45.266
strike, so it's more humane.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.282
Yeah?

19:48.270 --> 19:50.037
Oh, man.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.372
Well, what do you...?
Oh, you like it?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.641
- What do you think?
- I love it.

19:53.709 --> 19:54.976
I mean...
Ah.

19:55.043 --> 19:58.579
I don't know what to say, 'cause
no one's ever really, um...

19:58.647 --> 20:00.181
I don't know what to say, guys.

20:00.249 --> 20:01.782
You don't have to say anything, man.

20:01.850 --> 20:04.819
Maybe I could give it a quick
whirl around the basement and

20:04.886 --> 20:06.954
see if I can kill a couple rats.

20:07.022 --> 20:08.322
Yeah, absolutely.
You've earned it.

20:08.390 --> 20:10.491
You should, you should.
Go bash 'em up, buddy.

20:12.804 --> 20:14.095
Whoo!

20:15.297 --> 20:17.779
What a life.
