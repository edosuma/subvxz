I don’t think my

So, um, wow.
Do you know?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.834

I knew what would

01:21.667 --> 01:23.333
It was subtle

I saw the weakness with
the cheese sandwich thing.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.533
- Awww.

I’m drenched in sweat.

01:58.133 --> 01:59.200
I laughed.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.100
The absurdity of the
situation and then Tom just...

02:04.133 --> 02:06.633
I knew. As soon as
he started repeating

02:06.667 --> 02:09.633
delicious cheese sandwich.

02:09.667 --> 02:13.266
Ahh, I just lost it. Ugh!

Mae Martin is the second

02:16.800 --> 02:19.166
the first casualty of Tom
Green’s twisted genius.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.533
Eight comedians are left.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.000
It’s still blue, right?
We can still...

02:23.033 --> 02:24.066
- Yeah.
- Smile?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.233
Yeah. We can still smile.
Have fun.

02:25.266 --> 02:27.700
Smile. Enjoy.
Smile. Relax.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.033
Be cordial with
one another.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.700
I feel good that
I can smile for a minute.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.700
It’s nice.

02:32.734 --> 02:36.033
Enjoy smiling for a moment.

02:36.066 --> 02:37.367
Oh my gosh.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.700
Your face is so cute
when you’re about to laugh.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.533
Like I spent the
entire time on the edge.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.166
I don’t know
how they’re doing it.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.767
Here we go and...

02:46.834 --> 02:48.100
There we go.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.000
The musical cue they
could afford to pay for.

02:51.767 --> 02:52.867
Alright, so how do
you guys think

02:52.900 --> 02:54.367
this is going to play out?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.500
I don’t think Dave
is going to laugh at anybody.

02:56.533 --> 02:59.934
Dave lives in a sort of
quasi giggle, at all times.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:01.200 --> 03:02.567
Lajoie’s a dark horse, though.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.433
Oh, do you think?

03:03.467 --> 03:04.667
Yeah.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.033
I think Tom’s gonna win.

03:06.066 --> 03:09.667
I’ve seen Tom do insane
things with a straight face.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.900
I never thought he was more

03:10.934 --> 03:12.333
attractive than he is now.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.734
Is he crazy?

03:13.767 --> 03:14.600
I assume.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.400
I assume. Yeah.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.734
At this point...

03:22.767 --> 03:26.300
I’m starting to feel
pretty good because

03:26.333 --> 03:29.834
I’ve lasted this long
but everyone’s dangerous.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.133
Oh, hey!

03:32.166 --> 03:33.567
You look pretty.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.333
Dave, Tom Green
and Colin have been

03:37.367 --> 03:39.700
making me laugh
my whole life

03:39.734 --> 03:42.000
and I’ve never tried
to not laugh

03:42.033 --> 03:43.834
when they were
making me laugh.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.900
And so I’m in
a room with them and

03:45.934 --> 03:47.400
I’m supposed to not laugh...

03:47.433 --> 03:48.433
Well, what do I do?

03:49.567 --> 03:51.467
It’s a weird, weird...

03:51.500 --> 03:53.266
situation to be in.

03:56.266 --> 03:57.600
I’m... I’m gonna do a bit.

03:57.633 --> 03:58.700
- Ok!
- Oh my gosh...

03:58.734 --> 04:00.700
That I hope amuses you.

04:00.734 --> 04:02.233
- Ok.
- Oh...

04:02.266 --> 04:03.433
Oh good, here we go.

04:03.467 --> 04:04.834
This is what we need!

04:04.867 --> 04:06.400
Where did
you come from?

04:06.433 --> 04:07.667
I was right here.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.367
But was that little
secret door there all along?

04:10.400 --> 04:11.333
Yeah.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.367
Really?

04:12.400 --> 04:15.700
Alright, this will be
a scene from my,

04:15.734 --> 04:17.066
uh, favourite
horror movie.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.133
Ok.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.233
Imagine it’s black and white.

04:20.266 --> 04:21.467
- Ok.
- Alright.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.934
Hold on, hold on.

04:22.967 --> 04:24.900
- Alright. Oh!
- There.

04:24.934 --> 04:26.567
This sounds great.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.200
Suzy.

04:28.233 --> 04:31.133
You know I love
you very much.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.066
Oh... it’s a full
moon tonight.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.467
Oh my God.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.300
There’s something
I’ve got to tell you.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.800
A few years ago when
I was in Pennsylvania,

04:39.834 --> 04:41.967
I was walking along the
forest and I was bitten.

04:43.567 --> 04:44.934
I was bitten by a squirrel.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.367
But it wasn’t any
ordinary squirrel.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.967
It was a cursed squirrel.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.500
And now whenever
there’s a full moon,

04:54.533 --> 04:56.834
I become that...

05:06.100 --> 05:08.367
Oh my God!

05:08.400 --> 05:14.066
Mony, Mo, Mooo,
mooney, money, mooney.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.633
Think unhappy thoughts.

05:36.934 --> 05:39.233
A cursed squirrel.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.867
It’s so dumb.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.133
The outfit.
That stupid thing,

05:47.166 --> 05:50.000
is the funniest thing
I had ever seen.

05:50.033 --> 05:52.633
The only way I could
keep from laughing is

05:52.667 --> 05:55.633
to literally chew
on my own lips.

05:57.734 --> 05:59.300
Uh oh...

05:59.333 --> 06:00.233
Look at Deb.

06:04.834 --> 06:07.100
Oh boy.

06:08.433 --> 06:11.467
The were-squirrel...
it is so funny.

06:11.500 --> 06:16.000
So all I’m doing is,
uh, puckering my lips and

06:16.033 --> 06:20.533
for some reason also widening
your eyes is helpful.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.533
Uh huh. Yeah.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.533
No, no, no, that’s
what I was thinking.

06:28.734 --> 06:30.033
That’s what I was
thinking yeah.

06:30.066 --> 06:31.367
Something
about absurdity and

06:31.400 --> 06:34.033
silliness especially
when it’s Colin.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.300
I’m kinda having a hard
time keeping a straight face.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.734
Uh huh. Uh huh.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.633
I mean, look at Tom.
Look at Tom’s face.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.800
Yep.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.133
Stupid.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.400
Trevor, the big
man, is in big trouble.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.433
That feels nice.
I like it.

06:53.467 --> 06:54.700
Oh boy.

06:55.767 --> 06:57.033
Thank you. And scene!

06:58.567 --> 06:59.667
Oh boy!
Wow! You’re uh...

06:59.700 --> 07:01.000
Jesus...

07:01.033 --> 07:02.333
That was amazing.

07:02.367 --> 07:05.133
That was the closest
I’ve come, uh, so far today.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.867
Colin Mochrie,
he is very absurd...

07:06.900 --> 07:08.133
Woo.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.567
And that was very
hard for me because...

07:09.600 --> 07:10.967
I’m a laugher!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I am. And I’m not good,
like, like this is me being,

07:13.033 --> 07:15.934
this is my poker face.

07:17.934 --> 07:19.834
How long did that last?

07:23.700 --> 07:26.000
Making some
delicious bread balls.

07:26.033 --> 07:26.900
I’m terrible
at laughing so

07:26.934 --> 07:28.467
I think that’s my hiccup.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.567
I laugh by myself.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.467
I laugh in the shower.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.800
I laugh all the time.

07:31.834 --> 07:34.166
So I’m just
gonna focus and,

07:34.200 --> 07:37.533
take this as seriously
as possible.

07:37.567 --> 07:40.667
You have to really
put effort and care into it.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.934
’Cause people say "Oh, I cannot
taste the difference".

07:45.667 --> 07:47.367
That’s the thing about
the bread ingredient...

07:47.400 --> 07:50.934
Hey, who’s Andrew talking to?

07:50.967 --> 07:52.900
So many possibilities to it.

07:52.934 --> 07:55.767
So I take one of these,
roll it up here because no one

07:55.800 --> 07:57.500
is going to complain if
there’s

07:57.533 --> 07:58.233
a little bit of
extra cheese.

07:58.266 --> 08:01.300
Oh, for fuck sake!

08:02.734 --> 08:05.100
Andrew has not
cracked a smile.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.900
He’s going to be
a tough cookie.

08:06.934 --> 08:08.233
He’s pretending
we’re all racist,

08:08.266 --> 08:09.633
that’s what
keeps him alive.

08:14.467 --> 08:16.166
Pretending, am I right?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.767
Ooooohhhh!

08:19.800 --> 08:20.867
You wanna hit the red?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.400
Yeah! Can I?

08:25.433 --> 08:27.266
There’s a
possibility it was me.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.300
Uh oh.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.533
I’m gonna go
lay down the law.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.767
Goddamn it.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.934
I might have
broke on that one.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.633
I’m not sure.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.700
Bad news everybody,
I caught more people

08:39.734 --> 08:41.467
in the act of losing.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.900
- Oh no!
- Oh!

08:42.934 --> 08:44.133
Oh boy,
oh boy, oh boy.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.467
Lot of guilty consciences.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.367
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.367
Let’s take a look at this TV.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.000
Hmmm.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.433
He’s pretending
we’re all racist

08:50.467 --> 08:51.400
that’s what
keeps him alive.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.400
Pretending, am I right?

08:59.133 --> 09:00.333
Oh, you hung
on for so long.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.867
Comedy is about
catching someone by surprise.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.100
I wasn’t expecting it
and it got me.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.967
It got me good,
it got me clean.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.300
- That’s a yellow, Trevor.
- Yep.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.500
Yep.

09:15.867 --> 09:19.500
But wait!
There’s more.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.233
So many possibilities to it.

09:23.266 --> 09:25.066
So I take one of these, roll
it up here because no one

09:25.100 --> 09:27.767
is going to complain if
there’s

09:27.800 --> 09:28.834
a little bit of
extra cheese.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.967
My yellow card...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.100
I hope it was
worth it to you.

09:35.133 --> 09:39.333
My yellow card
was of my own stupidity.

09:39.367 --> 09:43.100
I was doing a bit
only for myself

09:43.133 --> 09:46.767
and I made myself laugh.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.166
This is a yellow for you.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.834
Self yellow!

09:52.834 --> 09:54.000
Phew!

09:55.667 --> 09:56.900
You gotta
really watch it, eh?

09:56.934 --> 09:58.834
You gotta watch it.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.567
Terrible reason
to get a yellow.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.734
That was a murder
suicide right there.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.433
K. Trevor and
Andrew get hit

10:06.467 --> 10:08.166
with yellow cards
and join Debra and

10:08.200 --> 10:09.633
Dave in the
danger zone.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.500
Aww shit.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.467
Tom, what are you making?

10:23.500 --> 10:29.333
I am making a delicious
grilled cheese sandwich.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.066
Oh!

10:30.100 --> 10:31.433
Oh God, here we go.

10:31.467 --> 10:33.667
Oh my God, he’s making
cheese sandwiches again.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.033
I already had one,
it was very good,

10:35.066 --> 10:36.033
it was very delicious.

10:36.066 --> 10:40.033
Yes. I uh. If... if...

10:40.066 --> 10:42.133
Almost turned it around
on me there Colin.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.333
Oh.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.867
Almost used my own
delicious cheese sandwich

10:45.900 --> 10:47.066
against me there.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.967
Careful, Tom.
Dangerously close to the edge.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.967
Del... Delicious
cheese sandwich.

10:56.734 --> 10:59.000
There’s nothing
a comedian finds funnier

10:59.033 --> 11:01.500
than having their own
material told back to them.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.400
So I thought, "Oh!
This could be a weakness."

11:04.433 --> 11:05.700
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm. Yeah.

11:05.734 --> 11:08.133
You might have
found my kryptonite.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.600
Delicious...
cheese...

11:11.633 --> 11:14.066
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.633
Deb is like,
in a constant laugh.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.033
Yeah. Yeah, she’s fucked.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.767
I do not like
her chances.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.367
Mmm.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.233
What would, uh, "delicious
cheese sandwich" in French be?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.600
<i>Sandwich au fromage délicieux.</i>

11:25.633 --> 11:27.467
- Sandwich!
- Sandwich!

11:27.500 --> 11:28.300
Well... actually I
embellished that a little bit.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.567
<i>Délicieux...</i>

11:29.600 --> 11:32.266
It would be eh,
<i>sandwich au fromage câlisse.</i>

11:33.900 --> 11:35.934
Uh, no.
It’s <i>sandwich au fromage.</i>

11:37.567 --> 11:38.967
Close but you gotta,
like make it, like...

11:39.000 --> 11:40.133
Do I sound
a little Latin?

11:40.166 --> 11:43.000
<i>Eh, crismo..
coup de morceaux.</i>

11:43.033 --> 11:45.500
- Uh, <i>crismo. Crispo fromage.</i>
- Yeah.

11:45.533 --> 11:48.333
<i>Tout la fruit!</i>

11:48.367 --> 11:51.867
Here we go, I would be
laughing if I was in there now.

11:53.266 --> 11:54.734
I was going to say
<i>jambo</i> but that’s ham.

11:54.767 --> 11:57.033
Well, yeah, you’re saying
it way too nicely.

11:57.066 --> 12:00.133
- Oh. <i>Jambo.
- Jambo? Jambo?</i>

12:00.166 --> 12:01.533
<i>- Jambo?</i>
- No, no <i>Jambon!</i>

12:01.567 --> 12:02.934
My name is Jambo,

12:02.967 --> 12:07.467
I’m here to take over
the La Molson Labatt factory!

12:09.533 --> 12:10.767
It’s like
a villain right?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.266
I think it
was George Lopez.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.767
No, no, no, no, no.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.000
George is like...

12:15.033 --> 12:17.667
Top of the mornin’ to ya
I’m George Lopez.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.934
Top of the mornin’ to ya?

12:21.433 --> 12:24.033
<i>Je suis un homme.</i>

12:27.100 --> 12:28.934
Oh my God.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.066
Shit!

12:30.100 --> 12:31.700
- The second he did it...
- He realised right away!

12:31.734 --> 12:33.000
There’s another one!

12:36.467 --> 12:40.600
Uh oh!
Uh oh. Uh oh.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.834
What’s it gonna be?

12:47.967 --> 12:49.000
Ok.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.400
One of you lost your shit but
we’ve managed to find it.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.200
I don’t quite know what
that means but...

13:00.233 --> 13:02.600
Um, watch the TV.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.266
I was going to say
<i>jambo</i> but that’s ham.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.633
Well yeah, you’re saying
it way too nicely.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.500
My name is Jambo,

13:08.533 --> 13:10.266
I’m here to take over!

13:10.300 --> 13:11.633
I think it
was George Lopez.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.333
Top of the mornin’ to ya
I’m George Lopez

13:15.367 --> 13:16.867
Top of the mornin’ to ya?

13:18.700 --> 13:21.333
<i>Je suis un homme.</i>

13:28.934 --> 13:31.000
That’s a yellow
for Jon Lajoie.

13:31.033 --> 13:32.834
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.500
Wait. But that’s not all.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.900
- Oh no!
- Oh okay.

13:35.934 --> 13:38.533
- Somebody else sucks, too.
- Shit.

13:40.467 --> 13:41.433
Watch the TV.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.533
Tom, what are you making?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.900
A... Delicious...

13:46.934 --> 13:49.567
Grilled cheese sandwich.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.100
Oh God, here we go.

13:51.133 --> 13:54.633
Delicious cheese sandwich.

13:57.767 --> 14:00.867
No!

14:00.900 --> 14:02.500
So as I understand it,

14:02.533 --> 14:04.767
that means you have
a fucking red card.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.967
Oh! Oh!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.934
Awww.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.333
Fine!

14:09.367 --> 14:11.066
- Debra!
- Alright, bitches.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.800
Time to say your goodbyes
and then join me in the lounge.

14:13.867 --> 14:15.200
I knew it
was going to be you.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.266
It was Colin!
Damn him!

14:17.300 --> 14:19.133
He’s just so silly.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.867
- Ahhh!
- Yay!

14:20.900 --> 14:21.800
Honestly, without
being totally cheesy

14:21.834 --> 14:23.200
like there
was no losing.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.467
Like, we knew we were still
going to be able to have fun

14:25.500 --> 14:26.834
but I knew he’d be the
one to take me out.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.767
I knew it. Ugh!

14:28.800 --> 14:31.567
Debra’s red card has her
on a one way ticket to the lodge

14:31.600 --> 14:34.767
thanks to Colin Mochrie
who also pushed Jon

14:34.800 --> 14:35.934
onto thin ice with
a yellow card.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.133
Hey! This is nice!

14:40.166 --> 14:41.133
Right?

14:41.166 --> 14:42.467
- Hi, hon.
- Oh my gosh.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.467
So now you all
have to inch down.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.633
Do we get another sixteen
hours in the blue light?

14:51.367 --> 14:52.667
And....

14:54.100 --> 14:55.734
There we go!

14:55.767 --> 14:57.633
Now it’s a
real sausage party.

15:04.266 --> 15:05.300
Let’s do it.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.333
Oh, shit.
Here we go.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.700
Brandon’s ready
to do his bit.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.367
This better be explosive.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.934
It better be Tina Turner.

15:11.967 --> 15:15.367
I’m gonna do something.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.433
Oh, this is cute.

15:16.467 --> 15:17.800
I like this.
I like this.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.967
Human contact.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.433
I think
my comedy’s for everyone.

15:22.467 --> 15:25.000
I know that maybe it’s not
every straight white

15:25.033 --> 15:28.133
man’s cup of tea but
let me just try and

15:28.166 --> 15:30.300
see what happens, see
if I can get them.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.300
Ok!
Hello everyone!

15:34.100 --> 15:36.100
I am Brandon Ash-Mohammed.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.400
All right!

15:38.433 --> 15:40.900
But you may know me
as the girl of size

15:40.934 --> 15:43.266
who always get the guys.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.333
A lot of people think
that if they wanna win

15:45.367 --> 15:48.600
Prince Charming they gotta
lose a few pounds, right?

15:48.633 --> 15:49.734
I’ve heard that.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.300
- I say fuck that.
- Yeah!

15:52.333 --> 15:55.367
So today I’m gonna show you
a couple ways to eat,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.867
that’ll make the men skeet.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.467
Mmm. Mmm.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.033
Skeet! Skeet! Skeet!

16:01.066 --> 16:02.033
Boys, get your tissues ready.

16:02.066 --> 16:02.700
Get your tissues ready. Ok.

16:02.734 --> 16:04.900
Is skeet like jizz?

16:04.934 --> 16:06.300
It’s, uh, pre-ejaculate.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.433
Pre-ejaculate! Ah!

16:09.367 --> 16:11.100
Skeet means pre-ejaculate?

16:13.266 --> 16:14.967
So for our first move
what you’re gonna need

16:15.000 --> 16:17.967
is chips and uh...
and a chair.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.333
You can use any snack.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.433
So what you’re gonna do is
sit seductively like...

16:22.467 --> 16:23.500
Yes, daddy!

16:23.533 --> 16:24.500
Ooh, this seat is so hard.

16:24.533 --> 16:25.967
- Yes!
- Oh my God.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.333
Then you’re gonna
drop it like it’s hot.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.633
- Uh-huh.
- And then bam!

16:28.667 --> 16:29.967
Rub that chub.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.200
Rub that chub.
Rub that chub.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.500
Rub it!

16:33.533 --> 16:35.934
Not a dry pair of
jockies in the house.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.367
Our next and final move,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.200
you’re gonna be at the club,

16:43.233 --> 16:44.967
you’re talking
to a hot guy whatever.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.333
Eating a banana.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.700
I often eat
bananas at the club.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.200
Maybe you drop
the banana and you...

16:50.233 --> 16:51.300
Uh-oh.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.033
And you’re like
I’m about fitness.

16:52.066 --> 16:53.266
Yep.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.734
Fittin’ this right
in my mouth and BOOM!

16:56.767 --> 16:57.700
Whoa!

17:00.066 --> 17:01.533
There was a lot
of energy but

17:01.567 --> 17:03.333
I’m too old to marvel
in anything.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.000
I mean I saw
the moon landing.

17:05.033 --> 17:07.066
After that, nothing’s
really that marvelous.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.066
Boom.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.834
Not a dry pair. Of jockies.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.333
In. The. House.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.667
This is insane.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.767
I’ve never been on a
Japanese game show before

17:15.800 --> 17:17.834
but... I imagine
this is as close

17:17.867 --> 17:19.633
we’re going to find
in this country.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.467
Thank you.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.300
- Thank you.
- Alright.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.333
Alright.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.834
You put the
ass back in potassium.

17:27.867 --> 17:29.133
Thank you.
Thank you.

17:29.166 --> 17:33.900
This has been aerobics
for getting a row of dicks.

17:36.433 --> 17:37.133
Thank you.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.567
Yeahhhh.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.033
All very
helpful information.

17:44.467 --> 17:45.700
Tom!

17:47.367 --> 17:49.033
Oh my God.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.066
I think I made Tom Green
question his sexuality

17:53.100 --> 17:54.834
and that’s what I wanted.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.166
That was the goal.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.400
That was something.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.734
That was something else.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.367
I’m gonna use
the bathroom real quick.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.467
Ok. Hey guys.
Sorry to interrupt.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.600
Is anybody hungry?

18:05.633 --> 18:06.700
I would love lunch.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.066
It doesn’t stop
the clock, does it?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.300
It doesn’t stop the clock.

18:13.900 --> 18:14.934
Oh our lunches.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.333
Mmm hmm.

18:16.367 --> 18:17.600
Bon Appetit.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.600
Do you think they’re going
to do anything with the lunches?

18:22.633 --> 18:24.500
Oh yeah,
funny, funny lunch.

18:24.533 --> 18:25.467
Funny lunch.

18:33.133 --> 18:35.400
It’s amazing, I can
still hear Caroline.

18:35.433 --> 18:36.367
Yeah, I know!

18:36.400 --> 18:37.667
Even through the soundproofing.

18:38.934 --> 18:39.767
He smiled!

18:39.800 --> 18:40.533
Really?

18:40.567 --> 18:41.834
I can’t believe this.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.200
Uh-oh.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.800
They’ve all got
mouths full of food.

18:55.867 --> 18:59.500
So, this one blew my mind.

18:59.533 --> 19:02.266
This one, this one broke
my heart, I won’t lie.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.166
But the game doesn’t
stop even at lunch.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.667
Let’s watch.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.834
It’s amazing
I can still hear Caroline.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.033
I know!

19:18.567 --> 19:19.567
I forgot.

19:20.734 --> 19:23.033
I totally forgot the one
rule of the show.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.333
Well, that was stupid.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.500
That was me doing
that to me

19:28.533 --> 19:30.967
because I wasn’t focused

19:31.000 --> 19:32.166
and because of Caroline!

19:33.400 --> 19:34.800
So that’s...
that’s a yellow card.

19:34.834 --> 19:35.967
- Thank you.
- Oh.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.333
They say never meet your heroes.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.767
Wow.

19:39.567 --> 19:40.533
It’s not over.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.600
Be better.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.700
Be better.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.266
Now that’s
a lunch bag let down.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.934
Colin’s yellow card means
he joins Jon, Dave, Andrew and

19:56.967 --> 19:58.300
K. Trev on the
chopping block.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.433
What happened?

20:05.467 --> 20:07.633
I... I laughed.
You missed everything.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.300
Oh, Jay came in?
I missed the whole thing?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.934
Yeah. You missed
the whole thing.

20:10.967 --> 20:12.233
Oh!

20:12.266 --> 20:13.000
Were you showering?

20:13.033 --> 20:15.967
Well, I was gonna.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I was gonna...

20:20.867 --> 20:22.200
Alright, I was jerking off.

20:22.233 --> 20:24.200
- Oh, ok.
- Oh boy!

20:24.233 --> 20:25.467
Hot.

20:29.233 --> 20:32.100
Here we go.
Now the game’s back on.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.700
We’re gonna play
"Would you rather?"

20:38.734 --> 20:40.066
Ok, let’s do it.

20:40.100 --> 20:43.266
Or why don’t we just all
eat the blood pudding pops?

20:44.767 --> 20:45.800
Shouldn’t they
have melted by now?

20:45.834 --> 20:46.800
They’ve congealed.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.600
- Ugh.
- Yuck.

20:48.633 --> 20:51.000
Was it actually,
black sausage?

20:51.033 --> 20:53.000
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

20:53.033 --> 20:54.500
This is the first one,
would you rather

20:54.533 --> 20:57.400
be trapped in a romantic comedy
and never find love?

20:57.433 --> 20:59.400
Or trapped in a
gross out comedy,

20:59.433 --> 21:01.100
be pranked everyday for
the rest of your life?

21:01.133 --> 21:02.233
Gross out comedy.

21:02.266 --> 21:02.967
Pranked everyday for
the rest of my life.

21:03.000 --> 21:03.767
Yeah.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.433
I have been trapped in that.

21:06.467 --> 21:07.433
I am trapped in that.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.900
That’s very good.

21:15.934 --> 21:17.367
- The blinking!
- The blinking!

21:17.400 --> 21:19.200
None of
this is realistic.

21:19.233 --> 21:20.400
I mean it’ll never happen.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.567
Oh no, it’s realistic...

21:22.600 --> 21:23.633
That is Tom’s life.

21:24.467 --> 21:25.700
Next one.

21:25.734 --> 21:29.633
Would you eat with your
butt or poop out your mouth?

21:29.667 --> 21:30.734
- Hmmm.
- Oh...

21:30.767 --> 21:32.166
Eat with the butt.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.300
I mean,
that’s just common sense.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.033
Yeah. Yeah.

21:34.066 --> 21:35.233
That’s a tough one.

21:35.266 --> 21:36.934
I think I’d like to just
do both of those things.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.633
Mmmm. Mmm.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.500
Let’s move on.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.934
Would you rather have
your tongue pierced

21:42.967 --> 21:45.433
or get a tramp stamp?

21:45.467 --> 21:46.700
Tramp stamp.

21:46.734 --> 21:48.500
Well, the tongue
piercing I hear heightens

21:48.533 --> 21:49.967
the experience
of a blowjob.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.400
Yeah.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.066
I dunno how me
having a tongue piercing

21:53.100 --> 21:55.700
would make me enjoy
a blowjob more.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.400
Oh, good one.

21:58.433 --> 21:59.633
- Alright.
- Alright.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.667
I didn’t need to conjure
that imagery in my head.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.533
Alright.
I was gonna say.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.233
I want Jon
to go back and sing.

22:08.266 --> 22:08.934
Wasn’t he going
to sing a song?

22:08.967 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.033 --> 22:12.000
Ok, he is,
he’s getting it.

22:12.033 --> 22:12.934
He’s getting it.

22:12.967 --> 22:14.133
- There we go.
- Here we go.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.900
Just a little
spontaneous little thing

22:15.934 --> 22:17.567
that I’m gonna do here.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.000
Uh, I believe it was
John A. MacDonald

22:21.033 --> 22:23.533
who once said

22:23.567 --> 22:27.433
we should
call our band "Metallica".

22:30.533 --> 22:33.433
I’m actually a serious
musician, I’ve been writing,

22:33.467 --> 22:36.533
uh, songs since
I was, uh, very young.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.934
- Three months old actually.
- Wow.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.500
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
- Wow.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.400
It was a little,
little guitar.

22:41.433 --> 22:42.500
Yeah. Three months.

22:45.233 --> 22:46.567
Three months old.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.934
♪ Da da da da ♪

22:50.967 --> 22:52.633
Jon operates
on a different level.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.300
His videos on YouTube
were such a big part of,

22:55.333 --> 22:57.500
like early Youtube
viral success.

22:57.533 --> 23:01.133
I know what this man is
capable of and that scares me.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.767
I would like to
share with you all

23:02.800 --> 23:05.166
the first song that
I ever wrote.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.800
Trying not to laugh.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.867
He’s dying,
he really likes to laugh.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.567
I’m just going
to do one quick thing.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.400
This is actually
a request from Jay.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.467
Oh, here we fucking go again.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.200
When I was walking
in this morning,

24:29.233 --> 24:32.734
I was carrying my guitar
case and, uh, he was like

24:32.767 --> 24:33.967
"Oh, you gonna
play some songs?"

24:34.000 --> 24:36.433
I was like, "I dunno maybe."

24:36.467 --> 24:39.000
And uh, he was like, "Yeah.
I write songs all the time."

24:39.033 --> 24:41.667
I was like, "Dude,
I’ll play one of your songs,"

24:41.700 --> 24:45.600
One of your songs,
Jay Baruchel’s songs.

24:45.633 --> 24:48.133
Oh my God.

24:48.166 --> 24:52.333
I seem to be the sort of,
um, fulcrum of Jon Lajoie's,

24:52.367 --> 24:53.934
uh, um, creative plan.

24:53.967 --> 24:56.166
I was equal parts
annoyed and flattered.

24:58.867 --> 25:04.000
So, Jay Baruchel, the host
of this show’s song still...

Pretty good man.
A little short but...

25:49.667 --> 25:50.900
Jay Baruchel!

25:53.100 --> 25:54.500
That’s nice.

25:54.533 --> 25:56.100
It could use a bridge but
otherwise it’s really good.

25:56.133 --> 25:57.333
Yeah.

25:57.367 --> 25:59.300
Whatever happened to
that R. Kelly guy anyway?

25:59.333 --> 26:01.233
You guys all know him, huh?

26:01.266 --> 26:03.734
Tom, I’ve seen you hanging
out with hip hop stars.

26:03.767 --> 26:06.567
You’re a Juno
nominated rapper.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.900
I was nominated
for a Juno.

26:07.934 --> 26:08.900
You were.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.100
Yeah... I lost.

26:12.333 --> 26:13.633
Yeah, you lost.
That’s why I say nominated.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.567
Hello?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.066
Hi, Trevor,
can you tell Jon Lajoie

26:19.100 --> 26:20.700
to go fuck himself please?

26:20.734 --> 26:22.033
Yeah, yeah.

26:22.066 --> 26:24.066
See ya later. Bye.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.367
That’s somebody telling us
to stop talking about R. Kelly.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.700
Yeah.

26:28.734 --> 26:31.133
Or talk more about
Tom’s Juno nomination.

26:31.166 --> 26:34.533
Oh!

26:34.567 --> 26:35.967
That’s a smile.
That’s a full smile.

26:37.433 --> 26:39.700
Uh oh!
Uh oh! Uh oh!

26:39.734 --> 26:41.400
Damn.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.500
This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts him.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.600
I don’t know.
I don’t know.

26:56.633 --> 26:59.767
I don’t think
I moved at all.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.500
Um...

27:01.533 --> 27:02.667
So scared.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.800
Yeah.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.100
Let’s take a look
at the TV guys.

27:07.166 --> 27:10.767
You’re a Juno nominated rapper.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.066
I lost.

27:12.100 --> 27:12.734
Yeah, you lost.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.400
Hello?

27:15.433 --> 27:16.567
That’s somebody
telling us to stop

27:16.600 --> 27:19.000
talking about R. Kelly.

27:19.033 --> 27:20.967
Yeah.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.467
- Oh no!
- You’re free!

27:25.500 --> 27:28.200
- Oh my god!
- You’re free. Dave.

27:28.233 --> 27:30.100
Ladies and gentleman,
another one bites the dust.

27:30.133 --> 27:33.834
Aww. Oh, fuck y’all.
Fuck y’all.

27:33.867 --> 27:36.066
I thought I might
have seen a smirk there.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.467
It was nice knowing that
I actually made Dave laugh.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.066
I mean, a certain amount
of guilt, but then also

27:42.100 --> 27:43.867
a certain amount
of pride as well.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.567
See ya.

27:52.767 --> 27:54.066
I’ll try to hold up
the old guy end.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.133
Ohh.

27:56.166 --> 27:57.767
- So let’s unpack this.
- Alright.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.533
What are you,
what are you thinking?

27:58.567 --> 28:00.133
What are, impressions?

28:00.166 --> 28:02.900
Well I just, I always
find R. Kelly funny.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.900
- Dave!
- Dave!

28:05.934 --> 28:07.033
Was that a smile?

28:07.066 --> 28:08.400
Having gone through it,

28:08.433 --> 28:12.367
it is a strangely
exhausting experience.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.133
I had a wonderful time
having a terrible time.

28:18.033 --> 28:21.333
Tom gives Mr. Dave Foley
the red card treatment.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.667
Adding another victim
to his hit list.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.767
Who will be next to enter
Tom’s cross hairs?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.433
Stay tuned for
more carnage.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.333
Aw shit.

28:31.367 --> 28:33.166
- Here we go.
- Shit.

28:39.166 --> 28:41.500
- What is this?
- What’s that?

28:45.834 --> 28:47.500
- Whoa!
- What?

28:47.533 --> 28:49.133
Hi, Daddy.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.433
He’s gonna hurt himself!

28:50.467 --> 28:52.367
- They’re not laughing?
- We’re not supposed to.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.500
I’m gonna have no fun.

28:53.533 --> 28:55.100
’Cause that’s the
kinda guy I am.

28:55.133 --> 28:56.166
How’s your vision?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.133
You think that’s
weird, you should

28:57.166 --> 28:58.333
see where his
balls are.

28:58.367 --> 29:01.567
Don’t you dare
with your cheese sandwich!

29:01.600 --> 29:03.400
How do you
not laugh at that?

29:03.433 --> 29:04.800
Are you not alive?

29:04.834 --> 29:06.133
Whoa!

29:06.166 --> 29:08.367
- I have the pizzas.
- Oh boy.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.867
Is it possible that we’re
just all losing our minds?

29:10.900 --> 29:11.767
Uh-oh.

29:12.967 --> 29:15.100
Uh! My penis has
never been so hard.

29:15.133 --> 29:16.433
Uh, cheque please!
