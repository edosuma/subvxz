<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:08.079
<i>The government
has a secret system.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.242 --> 00:12.588
<i>A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:14.919
<i>I designed The Machine
to detect acts of terror,</i>

00:15.082 --> 00:16.720
<i>but it sees everything.</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:20.161
<i>Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:23.199
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.597
<i>We don't.</i>

00:25.425 --> 00:29.703
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.501
<i>You will never find us.</i>

00:31.665 --> 00:33.872
<i>But victim or perpetrator,</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.674
<i>if your number's up,
we'll find you.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.611
<i>The politicians come and go,</i>

00:42.776 --> 00:44.255
<i>but we'll be here forever.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:45.971
<i>Beecher's looking for answers.</i>

00:46.013 --> 00:47.573
<i>I always told Cal to be careful.</i>

00:47.681 --> 00:49.354
<i>Being a cop's a dangerous job.</i>

00:49.516 --> 00:51.462
<i>HR rebuilt itself from ashes,</i>

00:51.618 --> 00:53.097
<i>'cause we didn't cut off the head.</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:55.563
<i>If we had,
Cal might still be alive.</i>

00:55.789 --> 00:57.894
<i>I'm playing by
different rules now,</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.197
<i>until I can bring down the boss.</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:02.397
<i>Who do you and Simmons report to?</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:04.132
<i>Who sails the shots?</i>

01:23.483 --> 01:26.293
<i>Those bastards think
they can steal from me?</i>

01:26.453 --> 01:28.660
<i>Then they're gonna reap
what they sow.</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:32.327
Finch, you doing
a little spring cleaning?

01:32.492 --> 01:34.062
I wish I was.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.902
I received numbers this morning.
38 of them, to be precise.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.576
Maybe the machine blew
a belt or something.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.305
It's not a lawn mower,
Mr. Reese.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.074
It's also never wrong.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.013
While I haven't decoded
all the numbers,

01:47.174 --> 01:49.586
there does appear
to be a common thread.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.178
They're all cops.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.655
Four of them
are known members of HR,

01:53.814 --> 01:56.454
leaving a high probability
that the rest may be as well.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.797
Three dozen members of HR,

01:58.952 --> 02:00.659
all about to commit
a violent crime?

02:00.821 --> 02:04.132
Or they've been targeted,
and HR is under siege.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.301
Things are about to get chaotic,
Mr. Reese.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.633
I've already contacted Ms. Shaw
to enlist her assistance.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.366
I'll see if Fusco's heard
any rumblings around the Eighth

02:12.532 --> 02:13.704
of an HR conflict.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.878
If we could locate
the source of the threat,

02:16.036 --> 02:18.846
perhaps we could defuse
the situation before it escalates.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.383
Perhaps.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.646
Meantime, you might want to get
Bear here fitted for a vest.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.214
Vest?

02:25.379 --> 02:28.383
Not like yours, Finch.
K-9 ballistic.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.650
For when things get chaotic.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.058
<i>Heard anything, Lionel?</i>

02:36.223 --> 02:39.830
<i>If you're looking for info on HR,
I got something you wanna see.</i>

02:47.234 --> 02:49.043
Everything okay here?
Detective Fusco.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.479
I'm Detective Stills.
Can we be of any assistance?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.307
Not unless you speak Russian.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.180
Best I can tell,
he was driving along,

02:55.342 --> 02:56.650
and he came upon a burning car.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.084
Then, if I got this right,

02:58.245 --> 03:00.191
someone knocked him out
and stole his truck.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.087
<i>Zdravstvuyte,</i> my friend.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.818
What kind of truck
were you driving?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.328
Office supply truck?
A delivery truck?

03:07.487 --> 03:08.557
<i>Da.</i>

03:10.057 --> 03:12.264
I think you can take it
from here, Officer.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.866
Nice badge. Wanna give me a warning
next time you do something like that?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.600
But that would ruin the surprise.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.109
So what does all this
have to do with HR?

03:21.268 --> 03:23.009
Know who has
an office supply company?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.171
Peter Yogorov.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.509
He uses it to smuggle drugs
into the city.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.610
Under the HR alliance,

03:27.774 --> 03:30.118
the cops are supposed to provide
safe passage.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.883
Now you wanted to know
why HR might be in trouble?

03:33.046 --> 03:36.186
How about the Russians losing a truck
full of contraband on their watch?

03:38.251 --> 03:40.288
<i>Think you can get us
a look at that camera feed?</i>

03:40.454 --> 03:42.400
Yeah, I love using
all my favors for you guys.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.364
What do you think, Finch?

03:47.527 --> 03:49.632
I'm inclined to agree
with Detective Fusco.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.638
So Yogorov blames HR
for his missing shipment.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.278
<i>Decides to sever ties.</i>

03:54.434 --> 03:56.778
And targets 38 members
of HR's rank.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.814
This situation is
a powder keg, Mr. Reese.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.474
It's about to explode.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.143
So who lit the fuse?

04:16.322 --> 04:18.303
<i>Whole department's reeling.</i>

04:18.725 --> 04:22.434
Not too sure of how many more
funerals the NYPD can endure.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.901
Do you have any idea
what happened

04:26.066 --> 04:29.138
between Detective Terney
and Officer Laskey?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.113
I wasn't aware of any conflict.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.909
Didn't even know
they knew each other.

04:33.073 --> 04:37.249
Well, there's some speculation
that it's HR-related.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.349
Mayor's concerned about a resurgence
in organized crime.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.121
Last time we talked,
you seemed to indicate

04:44.284 --> 04:47.925
that HR might have been
behind my godson's murder.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.524
Maybe.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.869
I don't know.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.272
All I know is taking on HR,

04:58.431 --> 05:01.173
it's like fighting
a battle that can't be won.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.708
One step forward,
three steps back.

05:05.505 --> 05:08.384
And now, losing my partner.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.485
I need to close the book
on Cal's murder.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.488
I have to move on.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.622
I wanted to tell you that in person.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.855
Joss...

05:20.020 --> 05:21.966
...you're one of the most
dedicated cops I know,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.295
and the city could use
more like you.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.901
Cal would be very proud
of everything you did.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.735
And don't worry.

05:30.897 --> 05:34.310
We will find who's responsible
for his death.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.242
Thanks, Alonzo.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.746
Anytime.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.175
I've got a big briefing
with the Mayor.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.685
I'll take care of this.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.016
I'll see you soon.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.748
I look forward to it.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.567
<i>Spoke to Carter this morning.</i>

06:00.727 --> 06:02.764
Says she's stepping down
on the Beecher case.

06:02.929 --> 06:03.999
You believe her?

06:04.164 --> 06:07.338
Even if I didn't, we can't have
any more bodies dropping right now.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.002
<i>Keep an eye on her just in case.</i>

06:09.169 --> 06:10.239
Will do.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.273
- Did Yogorov accept our new terms?
- Not yet.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.852
He wants to meet
at a grain depot in Red Hook.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.784
<i>Meet him in Siberia if he wants.</i>

06:17.944 --> 06:19.946
<i>Just get him to agree
to the new price.</i>

06:27.954 --> 06:29.956
Who's the new guy?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.796
This is Mitchell.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.402
He'll be running point
on tomorrow night's shipment.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.234
So we still on schedule?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.967
Just in time
to restock the shelves.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.635
My guy will call you
when he hits Laurel Hill.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.474
<i>We'll escort the trucks,</i>

06:43.637 --> 06:45.947
<i>provide safe passage through town.</i>

06:47.540 --> 06:49.486
But it's gonna cost
an extra ten percent.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.122
Why?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.484
Cost of doing business.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.954
If I'm going to pay more,
I ought to get more. Don't you think?

06:57.117 --> 06:58.118
Like what?

06:58.285 --> 06:59.923
My brother's still in Rikers,
for one.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.997
You were supposed to
get us both out.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.135
Well, these things take time.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.668
It's in progress.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.640
I'm starting to feel
less like your partner

07:08.795 --> 07:10.832
and more like your errand boy.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.238
We launder your money,
sell your drugs,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.107
even take out your trash.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.612
Like that narco cop you were
too afraid to knock off.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.842
<i>I didn't come to
hear you bitch, Yogorov.</i>

07:20.140 --> 07:21.983
You kicking in the extra
ten percent or what?

07:22.142 --> 07:23.587
I don't think so.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.680
You don't pay, we don't provide
safe passage for the drugs.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.021
Anything happens, it's on you.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.020
I'll take my chances.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.690
What do you wanna do?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.829
Let me worry about that.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.437
I need you on a new assignment.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.854
Tell me you didn't use
the front door.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.463
I never do.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.333
Where's Taylor?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.868
Somewhere safe.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.832
Any reason
he wouldn't be safe here?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.067
Like your off-the-books
pursuit of HR?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.733
Everyone needs a hobby.

08:19.899 --> 08:24.006
Most hobbies don't involve dirty cops
staked outside your apartment.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.411
If you want,
I can take care of him for you.

08:26.573 --> 08:29.076
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.919
Respectfully, I'd appreciate it

08:33.078 --> 08:34.751
if you left me alone
for a while too.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.756
Now's not the time
to fly solo, Carter.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.192
Don't get me wrong, John.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.890
I appreciate everything
you've done for me and the city.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.599
But in the eyes of the law,
you're still a criminal.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.105
And HR already knows
we work together.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.607
And if they could prove it...

08:52.766 --> 08:54.768
No, I'm sorry.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.073
I gotta finish this alone.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.013
All right.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.944
Do what you need to do.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.386
But HR won't go down
without a fight.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.363
If you get in over your head,
give me a call.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.467
With the way you guys
keep tabs on me,

09:16.623 --> 09:18.398
how much trouble can I get in?

09:19.592 --> 09:21.299
Watch your back, Joss.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.233
<i>Read your file, Carter.</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:54.895
Top of your class
at the academy,

09:55.061 --> 09:57.007
high marks across the board.
That's great.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.507
Now, throw it all out.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.306
None of it's worth a damn
out here on the street.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.683
Excuse me for one second.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.344
I'll be right back.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.784
Sup, Joss?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.358
What are you doing here, Paul?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.789
Just got back into town.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.089
Friend hooked me up
with a construction crew.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.596
I see you traded in
one uniform for another.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.701
<i>Guess you, uh, always had
a thing for hunting bad guys.</i>

10:24.858 --> 10:26.360
None of that answers my question.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.701
Wanted to see how you were
getting along, you know?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.309
See how our son was doing.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.968
You think you can just show up
after two years

10:35.135 --> 10:36.978
and ask to see Taylor?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.782
Look, Joss,
things are better now, okay?

10:39.939 --> 10:40.940
I'm better.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.609
So that means you went to the VA?

10:42.775 --> 10:44.049
The VA?

10:45.011 --> 10:48.151
Nah, I don't need some
head-shrinker analyzing me.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.282
All right, Joss?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.292
I just needed some time
to just clear my head.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.488
It's not that simple, Paul.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.231
I saw the toll
combat took on you.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.198
You still think
I'm a danger, don't you?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.395
Joss, I never laid a hand
on either one of y'all.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.234
No! I'd just find you asleep
on the kitchen floor

11:03.396 --> 11:05.467
cradling a gun, with our son
in the next room.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.373
Well, that's not gonna happen again.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.140
You're right.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.977
It won't.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.176
Because if you don't get help,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.412
you'll never have a relationship
with your son.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.716
And until then,

11:21.881 --> 11:24.157
I think it's best
you stay away from both of us.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.776
<i>I got your messages, Fusco.
All ten of 'em.</i>

11:40.600 --> 11:42.580
I heard what happened to Laskey.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.370
How you holding up?

11:45.738 --> 11:48.446
It's never an easy thing,
losing a partner.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.746
Kinda makes you wonder

11:49.909 --> 11:52.116
what really went down
between those two that night.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.780
Not sure I wanna know.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.420
You know what I think?

11:58.451 --> 11:59.794
I think someone else was there.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.131
I think someone shot them both
and staged the scene.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.798
The only question is, who?

12:08.127 --> 12:09.970
I don't know, Fusco.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.802
But whatever happened,
I don't want any part of it.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.643
Terney was the one who told you
HR had your boyfriend killed.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.241
Now he's dead along
with your rookie partner?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.978
- Don't you wanna know why?
Something I realized...

12:24.544 --> 12:27.218
It's not always worth
the risk to know why.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.826
I guess not.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.626
It'll be all right, Fusco.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.959
Just lay low for a while.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.664
Yeah.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.995
Hey, listen, I gotta get back.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.004
Don't stay a stranger, all right?

12:56.175 --> 12:57.677
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

12:57.844 --> 12:59.949
<i>I need you to pay someone a visit.</i>

13:05.285 --> 13:08.289
Just got word.
Our shipment's crossed state lines.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.990
So far, no signs of trouble.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.194
Makes me wonder why we ever needed
cops for this in the first place.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.374
What the hell?

13:30.209 --> 13:32.780
You know what crime
you're most guilty of, Peter?

13:32.945 --> 13:34.515
Letting this man cook for you.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.053
Those look heavy.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.736
Relax. If I wanted you dead,

13:46.893 --> 13:48.702
I'd be a little
more creative than this.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.068
I'm surprised
you're still in town.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.800
Figured you be
on a beach somewhere,

13:52.965 --> 13:54.740
sipping Mai Tais
and licking your wounds.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.742
I just can't leave yet.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.849
Not with front-row seats
to this little drama

13:59.005 --> 14:00.575
playing out between you and HR.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.481
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.316
The wheels of history are turning again.
Take my word for it.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.583
If the cops can't control you,
they'll betray you.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.249
Just like they did me.
But unlike me,

14:09.415 --> 14:11.520
you still have a chance
to do something about this.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.096
Words of wisdom from the man
who killed my father.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
Tell me why I should listen to you.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.662
Enemy of my enemy.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.335
I just can't pass up
a chance to watch HR suffer.

14:28.935 --> 14:29.936
What's this?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.605
A gift.

14:34.941 --> 14:38.252
Let that simmer for 15 minutes,
then stir with vinegar.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.599
Well?

14:59.766 --> 15:00.801
Yogorov got the package.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.470
Whether he received the message
is another story.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.638
He'll understand soon enough.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.149
Save everyone a lot of trouble
if you'd let me kill him.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.445
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

15:09.609 --> 15:12.818
In fact, you might want
to keep a low profile

15:12.979 --> 15:14.083
for the next couple days.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.783
Already planning on it.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.990
And whatever you're up to, Officer,
I wish you the best of luck.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.064
<i>I have a feeling
you're gonna need it.</i>

15:25.158 --> 15:26.466
Who was on the phone?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.572
Someone who owes me a favor.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.632
It's all there?

15:30.797 --> 15:33.744
Everything but the kitchen sink.
Tried it, didn't fit.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.240
I appreciate you not telling
the guys about this.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.340
Boys can't have all the toys.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.283
You're fixing to have quite
a party with all this stuff.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.984
You sure you don't need an assist?
The 37 mil can be tricky.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.495
Thanks.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.290
But I can take it from here.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.082
Honestly, Mr. Reese, this looks like
something you would do.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.857
Gotta admit,
I wish I was invited.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.926
After digging into 30
out of the 38 HR numbers,

17:02.088 --> 17:06.263
not a single man possesses the
talents displayed in that footage.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.426
I'm not so sure it was a man.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.164
Come take a look at this.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.502
Height, build... I think
our assailant might be a woman.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.907
A woman sets a car on fire and
attacks a drug shipment

17:17.069 --> 17:18.445
wearing a gas mask?

17:19.271 --> 17:21.444
Who does that
remind you of, Mr. Reese?

17:22.108 --> 17:23.781
What are you guys looking at?

17:28.013 --> 17:29.789
All right, you're being weird.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.061
This your handiwork?

17:35.755 --> 17:38.201
I guess she does know her way
around a 37 mil.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.700
You know something about this?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.600
I know someone needed firepower.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.934
Reese had plenty,

17:44.096 --> 17:46.042
so I made a donation
on his behalf.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.274
Wait.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.573
That's my grenade launcher?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.547
Oh, my God,
that's Detective Caner, isn't it?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.648
Your social circle
isn't terribly wide.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.811
She told me she didn't
want you guys involved.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.049
Because we would have tried
to talk her out of it.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.817
Until now,
her investigation into HR

18:02.982 --> 18:05.292
has fallen on the legal side
of things. But this...

18:05.451 --> 18:07.488
Pitting them against the Russians?

18:07.820 --> 18:09.822
You two get eyes
on every one of those numbers.

18:09.989 --> 18:13.061
And how exactly can we be
40 places at once?

18:14.493 --> 18:15.836
I don't care.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.668
If they find out
Carter's behind this,

18:17.830 --> 18:20.674
only one number's
coming up, hers.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.954
Yes?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.494
Good morning, Alonzo.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.697
How did you get this number?

18:41.854 --> 18:42.924
<i>Found it.</i>

18:43.089 --> 18:44.693
On the burner phone
your man dropped

18:44.857 --> 18:47.337
when he made off
with my supply truck last night.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.939
I was sorry to hear about
what happened to your shipment,

18:50.096 --> 18:52.133
but I'm not exactly sure
what you're implying.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.471
You ripped me off, old man.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.375
<i>Taking your toys and going home.</i>

18:57.536 --> 18:59.516
Except they weren't
your toys to take.

18:59.705 --> 19:03.710
<i>I'm going to pretend you're
having a momentary lapse in judgment.</i>

19:03.876 --> 19:07.153
You got robbed, and now
you're not thinking straight.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.850
Well, then let me be
extra clear right now.

19:10.016 --> 19:14.726
I'm looking at names and pictures
of top-level HR members.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.060
<i>Return my drugs,</i>

19:17.223 --> 19:19.829
or your men
don't make it home for dinner.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.410
Jess?

19:46.252 --> 19:48.425
Finch, I haven't found Carter,

19:48.587 --> 19:50.897
but I think I know
who the head of HR is.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.094
And I believe I know as well.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.705
I just decoded the last number.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.108
Alonzo Quinn.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.609
<i>Makes sense.</i>

20:01.767 --> 20:04.179
The Mayor's Chief of Staff
would be in a prime position

20:04.336 --> 20:06.509
to lead HR from the shadows.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.118
He's also the man who
ordered Beecher's death.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.219
This is more personal for Caner
than we thought.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.086
Then you'd better do everything
in your power to find her.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.893
<i>I see you're looking for me.</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:23.461
Jess?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.460
Where are you?

20:25.624 --> 20:27.626
I can't tell you that.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.966
But I know exactly where you are.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.641
Thought you promised
to keep your distance.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.579
That was before I knew
you were starting a war.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.983
We know about Quinn
and what he did to Cal.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.492
Then you know
why he can't get away with it.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.788
<i>Take it from me.</i>

20:53.919 --> 20:55.557
Revenge isn't the answer.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.662
Tell me where you are.
Please just let me help you.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.266
You once asked me to trust you

21:03.429 --> 21:05.841
to do what needed to be done.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.000
Now I'm asking the same of you.

21:19.311 --> 21:20.312
<i>Talk to me.</i>

21:20.479 --> 21:22.425
No one knows
who hit the Russian truck.

21:22.581 --> 21:25.528
Video footage from the RTCC
is conveniently missing.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.686
<i>This has "Man in The Suit"
written all over it.</i>

21:27.853 --> 21:30.595
Frankly, I don't care
who stole Yogorov's cargo.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.758
If he's considering
an end to our alliance,

21:32.925 --> 21:34.199
he's a major liability.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.998
<i>He's threatening our people.</i>

21:36.162 --> 21:37.698
I'd say the alliance is finished.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.469
Peter Yogorov doesn't have
the stones to come after us.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.221
Boss, what the hell just happened?

22:03.222 --> 22:05.202
Someone just took a shot
at me in my office.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.893
Yogorov.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.198
He wants to bite the hand
that feeds, he can starve.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.671
Round up his top ranks and take
them on out to Red Hook.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.832
<i>Kill 'em and bury 'em.</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:14.375
But bring Yogorov to me.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.809
<i>I'll deal with that
son of a bitch myself.</i>

22:19.738 --> 22:21.979
<i>While you were looking
for Detective Carter,</i>

22:22.141 --> 22:24.143
I received more numbers.

22:25.678 --> 22:30.058
It appears that HR has responded
to the Russian threat in kind.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.593
Guess it was only
a matter of time

22:31.750 --> 22:34.321
until this escalated
into an all-out war.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.729
If you'll forgive my gallows humor,
I'll put my money on HR.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.096
Why do you say that?

22:39.258 --> 22:42.432
Because they have something on their
side that the Russians don't.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.536
The law.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.717
<i>Grab Yogorov's men.</i>

22:55.040 --> 22:56.075
<i>Keep it quiet.</i>

22:56.242 --> 22:57.778
<i>No blood on the streets.</i>

22:58.711 --> 23:00.054
<i>Hands where I can see them.</i>

23:00.212 --> 23:01.520
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

23:01.580 --> 23:03.540
<i>- We're not doing anything.
- You sure about that?</i>

23:08.921 --> 23:10.764
<i>Nikolai,
where the hell are you?</i>

23:11.423 --> 23:14.404
Watch your back.
HR's moving against us.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.814
First five guys through that door
get early retirement!

23:25.971 --> 23:27.644
<i>That come with a pension?</i>

23:35.814 --> 23:36.986
I remember you.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.095
Good, we can skip
the introduction.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.392
HR already rounded up
all your boys.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.498
You're the last little Indian.

23:44.657 --> 23:48.127
And right now,
they're on their way here to kill you.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.099
So if you wanna live,
you're coming with me.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.677
Last time I went with you,
you arrested me.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.439
Guess old habits die hard.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.764
Taylor!

24:15.354 --> 24:16.856
Taylor?

24:20.326 --> 24:22.465
- You okay?
- We're great.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.198
Aren't we, little man?

24:24.363 --> 24:26.206
I'm sorry.
He just showed up.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.038
It's all right, thanks for calling.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.770
Paul, can I talk to you outside?

24:29.935 --> 24:31.710
Why not here?

24:31.870 --> 24:34.282
I mean, the boy's old enough
to hear what you have to say.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.217
Take my son into his room.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.151
Sure.
Come on, Taylor.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.626
What the hell are you doing,

24:50.789 --> 24:53.531
besides giving me a good reason
to lock you up?

24:54.059 --> 24:55.902
Look, Joss.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.563
A boy needs a father in his life.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.904
A father who's willing to admit
when he needs help.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.408
You know what?

25:04.570 --> 25:06.846
You didn't see combat like I did.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.748
You spent your time back on a base,
chatting up terrorists.

25:09.908 --> 25:12.252
And then when you came home,
you were fine.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.186
You think
it was that easy for me?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.087
I had problems too.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.250
But I found ways to handle them.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.260
Look, just because
I did it by myself

25:20.486 --> 25:22.557
doesn't mean you have to.

25:22.721 --> 25:24.325
Okay, so let me guess.

25:24.490 --> 25:27.437
I should go
talk to the VA, right?

25:28.927 --> 25:31.498
I told you,
I'm not gonna do that.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.041
That's right, because you run
from your problems.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.837
I'm not running!

25:41.440 --> 25:43.283
You gonna shoot me now, Joss?

25:43.442 --> 25:44.785
Get out of my house.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.457
Joss.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.076
It's okay.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.637
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.453
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.249
What's wrong with daddy?

26:23.882 --> 26:25.828
Sometimes he gets mad.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.154
And he doesn't know why.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.297
Will he get better?

26:30.823 --> 26:32.734
I don't know, baby.

26:33.959 --> 26:38.271
But hey,
as long as we got each other,

26:38.430 --> 26:40.967
you and I are gonna be fine.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.746
Okay?

26:44.903 --> 26:46.348
Come here.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.361
This your idea of protection?

26:59.518 --> 27:01.191
A sheriff station in Bedford?

27:01.954 --> 27:05.197
I booked you as a DUI
under the name Joe Manco.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.133
Should keep you alive
for a few hours, at least.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.863
The best I could do for the guy

27:11.029 --> 27:13.134
who took a shot
at the head of HR.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.542
I didn't take a shot at anyone.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.443
Thing about dirty cops, Peter,

27:18.604 --> 27:20.447
they're not big on evidence.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.653
Do you recognize this man?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.812
That cop got shot
a few months back.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.357
His name's Cal Beecher.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.893
He was Alonzo Quinn's godson.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.462
Remind me to send flowers.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.067
Peter, I know
Quinn's the head of HR.

27:38.223 --> 27:41.898
And I know he ordered your men
to carry out the hit on Beecher.

27:42.694 --> 27:46.733
Even if that were true,
never be able to prove it.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.242
Maybe not.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.401
But then again...

27:52.004 --> 27:55.417
I've been following HR
and the Russians for months.

27:55.574 --> 27:59.249
I've gathered enough evidence
to put almost everybody away.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.017
Including you.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.595
So then why are we talking?

28:06.752 --> 28:08.595
Because it's your lucky day.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.925
I want Quinn's head
more than I want yours.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.374
Sorry.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.271
I'd rather rot in prison
than be labeled a rat.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.906
Every room I go in,

28:26.071 --> 28:27.880
I always look for the exits.

28:28.774 --> 28:29.878
I was a soldier.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.953
Can't turn it off.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.556
So trust me when I tell you,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.624
you only have one way
out of this.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.455
And that's Quinn going down.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.962
He stays out there,
doesn't matter who else I arrest,

28:42.120 --> 28:44.122
he'll be coming for you eventually.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.098
I can take care of myself.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.102
I respect that.
I really do.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.299
But can you say the same
for your brother?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.542
You ever wonder
why HR's kept him in Rikers?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.642
Leverage.

29:00.138 --> 29:04.314
There are about half a dozen
corrupt cops awaiting trial

29:04.476 --> 29:08.424
on the same cell block
as your brother right now.

29:09.548 --> 29:12.427
You sign this statement,

29:12.584 --> 29:14.495
I could get Laszlo moved
to safer facilities

29:14.653 --> 29:16.997
within the next few hours.

29:17.155 --> 29:19.328
So what's it gonna be?

29:27.799 --> 29:29.574
Just show me the damn statement.

29:40.979 --> 29:41.980
Now what?

29:42.147 --> 29:43.683
I get an arrest warrant
for Quinn.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.090
You sure you got a judge
you can trust with that?

29:46.251 --> 29:48.527
Quinn liked to spread
that money around.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.530
We made him a lot of it.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.796
Spent the last few days
vetting judges.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.166
Narrowed it down to a couple.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.001
My statement,

29:58.163 --> 30:00.165
the evidence you got,

30:00.332 --> 30:03.176
and this whole thing
comes down to blind luck.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.349
Do me a favor, Officer.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.043
Choose wisely.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.210
Because if you don't,

30:12.377 --> 30:16.951
then you, me, and my brother...

30:17.115 --> 30:18.492
are all dead.

30:33.231 --> 30:34.642
Scared me half to death, Carter.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.007
I'm sorry.
Can't take any chances.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.740
Yeah, Wonder Boy told me
what you're up to.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.145
This your idea of laying low?

30:41.306 --> 30:42.876
I had to make a bit of a mess.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.418
That's why I needed to see you.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.578
Yeah?

30:46.745 --> 30:48.691
I'm not sure why.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.851
I couldn't figure out at first why
you didn't read me into this thing.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.758
Why you cut me out.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.160
Then I realized
you still don't trust me.

30:56.321 --> 30:57.925
I get it.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.593
I guess there's a certain stink
you really can't wash off.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.067
That's not it, Fusco.

31:02.260 --> 31:05.764
But I know how hard it was for
you to get out from underneath HR.

31:06.164 --> 31:09.771
Anything goes wrong, you're
the first guy they're gonna come for.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.346
I was trying to protect you.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.779
Protect me?
By keeping me in the dark?

31:16.174 --> 31:17.346
I thought we were partners.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.955
We are.
That's why I'm here now.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.113
What's this?

31:21.279 --> 31:24.920
It's to a safety deposit box
at the one state bank in Hoboken.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.188
Inside is everything
I collected on HR.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.128
Recordings, money trails, everything.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.469
I'm about to get
an arrest warrant for Quinn.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.027
Then what?

31:36.194 --> 31:37.639
Then I'm gonna arrest him.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.778
But if anything happens...

31:43.068 --> 31:44.388
...I need you to hold on to that.

31:44.469 --> 31:46.415
- No.
- "No" what?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.244
No way you're gonna
come here with this

31:48.407 --> 31:49.886
"if anything happens to me" crap.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.113
Lionel, you're the only person
in the world I trust with this.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.918
Plus you're the best partner
I ever had.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.173
If you think I'm gonna let you
take down Quinn by yourself

32:11.329 --> 32:13.502
after coming here
and saying something like that,

32:13.565 --> 32:15.169
you got another thing coming.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.515
Okay-

32:22.607 --> 32:25.281
We'll take your car,
but I'm driving.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.358
Oh, you might want
to get your vest.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.092
- Let me grab it.
- You know what?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.490
Grab your 12-gauge too.

32:33.652 --> 32:34.790
All right.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.602
Sorry, Fusco.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.161
But I gotta do this one alone.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.356
All this could have been avoided

33:02.514 --> 33:04.152
if your boss
hadn't tried to kill mine.

33:06.952 --> 33:09.296
Carter's so determined
to get Quinn,

33:09.454 --> 33:11.730
she's forgotten
about collateral damage.

33:12.858 --> 33:13.859
You ready, Shaw?

33:14.025 --> 33:16.528
One question.
Once we save the bad Russians

33:16.695 --> 33:18.231
from the bad cops,

33:18.396 --> 33:20.398
what exactly
are we gonna do with them?

33:20.565 --> 33:21.703
Let's finish this.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.856
FBI!
Who's in charge here?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.252
Detective Stan Mitchell.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.690
We got a tip the Russians
were making a deal out here.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.851
We came to bust it up.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.019
Carter.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.426
You know, we got a tip as well.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.828
Bunch of corrupt cops
were gonna kill some Russians

33:44.990 --> 33:46.936
over a pile of missing drugs.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.267
Mind if we look in your trunk?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.684
Hope you got
a good lawyer, Detective.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.878
Guess our work here is done.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.053
Did you find her, Lionel?

34:08.213 --> 34:09.954
She found me.
But she, uh...

34:10.114 --> 34:11.286
Let me guess.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.587
She ditched you.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.858
She's going alone on this one.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.431
She doesn't want any help.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.626
They'll kill her if they figure out
what she's up to, John.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.362
We'd better find her then.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.933
Let's split up. Spread out in case
Finch comes up with her location.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.074
Hello.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.277
Judge Monahan?
It's Joss Carter.

34:38.443 --> 34:40.922
I apologize for calling so late,
but I was hoping

34:41.079 --> 34:43.456
you could grant me
an arrest warrant tonight.

34:43.614 --> 34:44.992
It can't be done in the morning?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.061
I'm afraid not.
I have a sworn statement

34:47.217 --> 34:49.164
implicating a prominent member
of city hall

34:49.321 --> 34:51.995
in a major crime
and corruption ring.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.159
Have you spoken
to the DA about this?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.998
I will, first thing
in the morning.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.765
But right now,
I need the warrant.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.499
I understand.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.268
Get here as soon as you can.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.015
Sir, this is
Judge Andrew Monahan.

35:12.177 --> 35:13.952
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.922
I just received a call
you might want to be aware of.

35:17.082 --> 35:20.029
Do you know a police officer
by the name of Joss Carter?

35:21.753 --> 35:24.131
You were right to contact me.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.792
Tell me everything she told you.

35:39.504 --> 35:40.504
Joss!

35:43.141 --> 35:45.712
No uniform.
You made detective.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.015
What you need, Paul?

35:47.178 --> 35:50.057
I didn't come here
to ask you for anything.

35:50.215 --> 35:51.717
I just...

35:51.883 --> 35:53.658
Just wanted to show you this.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.396
Good for you.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.298
- You look better.
- I am.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.406
I mean, not all the way, but some.

36:07.565 --> 36:10.239
The counselings kicking my ass.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.245
Lot of stuff
I didn't wanna relive.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.711
Things I did, people I hurt.

36:14.806 --> 36:15.910
Yeah, uh, Paul, I...

36:16.074 --> 36:18.076
No, no, no. I know.
There's no going back.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.086
I see that now.

36:20.245 --> 36:24.250
But they keep telling me
I have to find a way forward,

36:24.416 --> 36:26.191
a Purpose.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.230
That's what I'm working on now.
I just wanted you to know that.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.424
If there's ever anything
I can do for Taylor,

36:31.589 --> 36:34.866
for both of you,
here's my number.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.779
Thanks for hearing me out, Joss.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.776
All right.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.474
Hello?

37:22.640 --> 37:23.744
Paul, it's me.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.615
Oh, hey, Joss.
Let me get him for you.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.781
Actually, I needed
to tell you something.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.251
What's up?

37:31.216 --> 37:33.662
Thanks.
For taking care of him.

37:33.818 --> 37:36.594
It's good he can rely on you.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.664
That's how
it's supposed to be, Joss.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.463
That's how
it always should have been.

37:42.627 --> 37:43.799
<i>All right?</i>

37:43.962 --> 37:45.839
Hold on, somebody wants
to talk to you.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.341
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, baby.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.005
How's it going over there?

37:53.171 --> 37:55.811
Good.
Dad tried to make a casserole.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.851
<i>We ended up ordering pizza.</i>

37:59.344 --> 38:00.948
Y'all are hopeless.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.681
You Okay?

38:03.848 --> 38:05.987
Yeah!
Fine.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.495
Just driving and, uh...

38:11.923 --> 38:14.529
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.503
<i>For what?</i>

38:18.196 --> 38:22.941
To me, you're still
my little dude, you know?

38:24.836 --> 38:28.841
Sometimes I forget
you're practically all grown up.

38:30.875 --> 38:34.721
These last eight months,
I've been secretive,

38:34.879 --> 38:36.358
keeping you in the dark.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.152
You're protecting me.
I get it.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.852
<i>But whatever you're doing,</i>

38:40.018 --> 38:42.020
<i>you know you don't have
to do it alone, right?</i>

38:43.721 --> 38:45.132
You got my back, don't you?

38:45.290 --> 38:47.793
<i>Always.
And not just me.</i>

38:47.959 --> 38:50.030
<i>Lots of people care about you.</i>

38:50.995 --> 38:53.532
If you ever need any help,
all you have to do is ask.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.233
<i>You know that, right?</i>

38:55.867 --> 38:57.471
I love you, baby boy.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.009
I'll call you tomorrow.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.309
I love you too, Mom.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.750
Okay.

39:37.942 --> 39:39.922
Judge Monahan,
thank you so much for...

39:40.078 --> 39:42.285
- Let's get this over with, shall we?
- Absolutely.

39:42.447 --> 39:45.860
I wouldn't be here this late
if it wasn't important, Your Honor.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.894
See, this warrant
is the key to our...

39:50.555 --> 39:52.694
He wasn't talking
about the warrant, Joss.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.132
Heard you were looking for me.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.397
Figured I'd save you the trouble.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.438
I'll spare you
the Shakespeare quote.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.150
You know, I think
that's your problem.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.879
You see yourself as a protagonist
in some great tragedy.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.649
Determined to face the world alone.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.314
Even if it gets you killed.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.424
"To be or not to be," bitch.
Move.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.437
For what it's worth, I had hoped
that we could have avoided this day.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.903
At least have the balls
to pull the trigger yourself.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.303
Don't outsource me
like you did your own godson.

40:33.464 --> 40:35.341
I don't relish
what happened to him,

40:35.500 --> 40:38.811
but sometimes sacrifices are
necessary for the greater good.

40:39.504 --> 40:42.610
My mistake was not having
you killed along with Cal.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.916
Then neither of you
would have had to die alone.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.663
You were right.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.300
I was wrong.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.364
I thought I could
take you down alone.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.031
Always did have trust issues.

41:05.029 --> 41:06.872
Tried to do it clean.

41:07.031 --> 41:10.877
Photos, recordings, sworn testimony.

41:13.638 --> 41:17.051
But then I realized
you're just too dirty.

41:17.475 --> 41:21.651
Everywhere I turned, you had friends
ready to help you out.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.349
And I was alone.

41:26.951 --> 41:28.396
So...

41:29.721 --> 41:31.632
I called some friends of my own.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.334
You get all that, fellas?

41:35.059 --> 41:36.163
She's not wired.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.136
It's a brave new world, boys.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.707
Don't you read the papers?

41:39.864 --> 41:41.866
Anyone can listen in on your phone.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.070
Even when it's turned off.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.417
<i>My mistake was not having
you killed along with Cal.</i>

41:49.574 --> 41:51.645
<i>Then neither of you
would have had to die alone.</i>

41:51.809 --> 41:53.083
Now, Mr. Reese.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.655
Everybody, down!

42:04.155 --> 42:05.532
Get your ass up here, now!

42:09.694 --> 42:11.935
- Thanks for the help.
- Thanks for the call.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.372
- Where are we taking him?
- Fed building downtown.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.273
The FBI may be
the only ones we can trust.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.239
Lot of dirty cops
between here and there.

42:18.403 --> 42:21.384
This will be the last mistake
you ever make.

42:23.508 --> 42:25.385
NYPD!
Get your hands on your...

42:34.285 --> 42:35.423
Where the hell are they?

42:35.586 --> 42:36.929
Gone.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.236
It's dead.
He shot out the engine.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.873
He didn't shoot your camera.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.411
Get this out on the wire.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.713
Our people only.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.412
Not just the ones in blue.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.559
I want every criminal outfit
on the street to have this picture.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.923
The man in the suit dies tonight.
