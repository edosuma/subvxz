What's wrong?
They're chasing me!

01:08.923 --> 01:10.923
Come on, G,
it's one day.

01:10.925 --> 01:12.202
A whole day?

01:12.204 --> 01:13.632
Maybe three hours
in the afternoon.

01:13.634 --> 01:14.928
It's not the whole day.

01:14.930 --> 01:15.988
Three hours?

01:15.990 --> 01:16.862
You're her uncle.

01:16.864 --> 01:17.922
I'm not really her uncle.

01:17.924 --> 01:19.521
She calls you Uncle Callen.

01:19.523 --> 01:21.488
And I'm not very good with kids either.
Now you sound like Kensi.

01:21.491 --> 01:22.836
Kids love you.

01:22.838 --> 01:24.651
Your kids, maybe;
other kids, not so much.

01:24.653 --> 01:26.199
A few weeks ago,
that kid in the sewer

01:26.201 --> 01:27.933
was about to poison
half the city.

01:27.935 --> 01:29.228
You talked him out of it.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.163
It's true, but I was also
ready to shoot him.

01:31.165 --> 01:32.896
No, you weren't.

01:37.809 --> 01:39.827
She's had to stay
with her grandparents

01:39.829 --> 01:42.183
while Michelle and I try
to flush out the Sidorov thing.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.046
I want this to
be special, G.

01:45.048 --> 01:46.569
Kensi and Deeks are dressing up.

01:46.571 --> 01:48.671
You were coming to her
birthday party anyway, right?

01:48.673 --> 01:50.161
Not dressed as a werewolf.

01:50.163 --> 01:52.777
It's not a werewolf,
it's Professor Lupin.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.986
You said it was a werewolf.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.509
Wait, Lupin sounds like
a werewolf.

01:55.511 --> 01:57.163
Technically, yes,
but only during a full moon.

01:57.165 --> 01:58.736
This is afternoon.
I mean, if anyone's

01:58.738 --> 02:00.275
gonna go as a werewolf,
it should be Deeks.

02:00.277 --> 02:01.748
The guy's halfway there already.

02:01.750 --> 02:05.060
All you got to do is
wear a robe, carry a wand.

02:05.062 --> 02:08.203
For my little girl?

02:08.205 --> 02:10.157
Please, Uncle Callen?

02:12.277 --> 02:13.716
Fine.

02:13.718 --> 02:15.504
But you owe me big-time.

02:15.506 --> 02:18.815
Just be glad she's out
of her princess phase.

02:28.897 --> 02:30.815
What are you doing?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.223
Shaving my legs.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.664
What does it look
like I'm doing?

02:33.666 --> 02:35.120
Um, it looks like
you're cleaning

02:35.122 --> 02:36.891
your gun with my T-shirt.

02:36.893 --> 02:38.828
Oh. Sorry.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.616
It was on the bench;
I thought it was a rag.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.446
No, rags don't
have sleeves.

02:43.448 --> 02:44.828
All right.
I mean,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.479
I've had this thing
since high school.

02:46.481 --> 02:48.451
Holy shirt, I believe it.

02:49.599 --> 02:53.119
Come on,
that was funny.

02:53.121 --> 02:54.905
Oh, and no comment
on me shaving my legs?

02:54.907 --> 02:56.540
"Uh, can I help you?

02:56.542 --> 02:58.342
Is it from
the waist down?"

02:58.344 --> 03:00.702
Dude, come on,
I'll buy you a new one.

03:00.704 --> 03:02.606
Yeah, you can't get me
another shirt because he is

03:02.608 --> 03:03.904
the last of his kind, thank you.

03:03.906 --> 03:05.438
He's a shirt.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.432
You have no idea

03:06.434 --> 03:07.746
what we've
been through together.

03:07.748 --> 03:09.684
Still a shirt, Linus.
Okay, no,

03:09.686 --> 03:11.538
'cause Linus had
a blanket, all right?

03:11.540 --> 03:13.509
This is the costume of

03:13.511 --> 03:14.623
my rebellion
awakening, all right?

03:14.625 --> 03:18.531
This was the anthem
of my youth.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.115
"Touching Wood"?

03:23.116 --> 03:24.429
It's the name of my band.

03:24.431 --> 03:26.594
We were 15 and made of awesome.

03:26.596 --> 03:27.942
Was this a boy band

03:27.944 --> 03:29.091
or was it a marching band?

03:29.093 --> 03:30.555
I'll have you know
it was a rock band.

03:30.557 --> 03:31.821
Yeah, mm-hmm.

03:31.823 --> 03:33.801
And I was the front man
and lead guitarist.

03:33.803 --> 03:35.749
Oh, God.

03:35.751 --> 03:37.298
Really?

03:37.300 --> 03:40.711
Please, please tell me there is
footage of you singing.

03:40.713 --> 03:42.741
Wow, the amount of delight
that you're getting out of this

03:42.743 --> 03:43.706
is a little unsettling.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.737
With good reason.
Sing something.

03:45.739 --> 03:47.037
No, I'm not gonna sing for you.

03:47.039 --> 03:49.034
Sing or...

03:49.036 --> 03:50.998
I'm gonna tell Callen and Sam.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.746
And then I'm gonna use

03:52.748 --> 03:54.661
every piece of technology
that we have

03:54.663 --> 03:58.273
to scour the planet
for footage of you performing.

03:58.275 --> 03:59.987
Okay, now you're
scaring me.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.528
Dance, monkey, dance.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.840
Possessed much?

04:05.616 --> 04:06.952
Okay.

04:06.954 --> 04:09.790
I'm just gonna text
Callen and Sam.

04:12.448 --> 04:14.229
"Hey, guys,
did you know that..."

04:14.231 --> 04:15.830
Stop texting, fine.
That's-- I-I will sing.

04:15.832 --> 04:17.019
Stop texting.

04:17.021 --> 04:18.504
I will sing.
You want me to sing, I'll sing.

04:18.505 --> 04:19.988
You want me to dance,
I'll be your monkey.

04:19.991 --> 04:20.846
Here we go.

04:20.849 --> 04:22.596
Bup-bup-bup.

04:24.413 --> 04:26.393
You ready for it?

04:26.395 --> 04:28.291
Oh, I'm ready.
Is this really necessary?

04:28.293 --> 04:29.727
Action.

04:29.729 --> 04:30.964
♪ Baby!

04:31.791 --> 04:34.215
♪ Baby...

04:35.455 --> 04:37.185
♪ Me-me-me-me-me,
gee-gee-gee-gee-gee-gee-gee ♪

04:37.187 --> 04:38.192
♪ Baby!

04:38.194 --> 04:39.727
Nope, sometimes,
you got to really

04:39.729 --> 04:41.279
breathe from the diaphragm;
it's important.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.780
It's been a long time
since I really

04:42.782 --> 04:44.031
blasted out the pipes,
so I just...

04:45.068 --> 04:46.368
Oh, God, wow.
Hi, how are you?

04:46.370 --> 04:47.518
What can I do for you?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.653
Uh, Hetty wants us...

04:48.655 --> 04:49.704
Awesome, I'd love
to be a part of it.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.038
Gonna go solve some crimes.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.924
...up in Ops. Wow.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.909
That was excitement.
No, Eric.

04:54.911 --> 04:57.245
That was fear.

05:06.421 --> 05:08.973
Hit it, Nell.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.424
A woman was stalked
and attacked

05:10.426 --> 05:14.295
in a city parking lot last
night by at least three men.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.898
Two of her attackers are
dead, along with a bystander,

05:16.901 --> 05:18.048
and the woman is missing.

05:18.050 --> 05:20.185
And this is a case

05:20.187 --> 05:21.936
for us because...?

05:21.938 --> 05:24.355
Because I'm assigning it to you.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.494
Who are the men
that attacked her?

05:30.496 --> 05:32.062
Haven't been identified.

05:32.064 --> 05:33.030
What about the woman?

05:33.032 --> 05:35.166
Nope.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.117
Okay, so where
do we start?

05:36.119 --> 05:38.336
I suggest you start
with the dead.

05:40.071 --> 05:41.589
Of course.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.879
Did you find anything?

05:47.881 --> 05:49.597
Mm, cheap cell phone--
probably a burner--

05:49.599 --> 05:51.273
$300 cash, and that's it.

05:51.275 --> 05:53.439
No wallet, no keys,
nothing else.

05:53.442 --> 05:55.165
Okay, that's weird.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.536
If somebody took the wallet,
they would have taken the cash.

05:57.538 --> 05:59.450
Wait a minute.

05:59.452 --> 06:02.444
These clothes also
don't have tags in them.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.324
You're kidding.

06:04.326 --> 06:05.797
What do you got?

06:05.799 --> 06:08.048
Nada.

06:10.081 --> 06:13.211
Nothing on facial rec,
nothing on the prints.

06:13.214 --> 06:14.599
No tattoos, no scars.

06:14.602 --> 06:16.800
So these guys are ghosts.

06:16.802 --> 06:19.203
Welllet's hope they're ghosts
with dental records.

06:20.744 --> 06:22.860
Covered all the exits.

06:22.862 --> 06:26.178
Closed in from all angles
like a pack of jackals.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.972
She never had
a chance of escaping.

06:27.974 --> 06:29.292
Yeah, no purse
or briefcase on her,

06:29.294 --> 06:31.019
so she probably wasn't
coming from work.

06:31.021 --> 06:32.931
Every vehicle that came in
was accounted for,

06:32.933 --> 06:35.472
so either they took her car
or she didn't have one.

06:35.474 --> 06:37.485
So what the hell's
she doing here?

06:44.528 --> 06:46.897
Exertion made them
bleed out faster.

06:54.127 --> 06:55.903
Stopped to rest here.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.615
What do you got, Eric?

06:58.617 --> 06:59.940
Actually, I was just

06:59.942 --> 07:02.047
checking in to see
if you found anything.

07:03.691 --> 07:06.914
She's standing over your
shoulder right now, isn't she?

07:06.916 --> 07:09.115
Yes, she is,
Mr. Callen.

07:09.117 --> 07:11.940
And she's looking for
a situation report.

07:11.942 --> 07:13.696
We found a blood trail.

07:13.698 --> 07:16.568
Of the woman's or
the attackers?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.323
We're not sure yet.

07:18.325 --> 07:20.845
Sam's gonna send
you some photos.

07:24.596 --> 07:26.063
That's a lot of blood.

07:41.179 --> 07:42.631
So, if you were
in a band,

07:42.633 --> 07:44.227
how come I've never
heard you play guitar?

07:44.229 --> 07:45.552
Maybe I never bring
my ax to work.

07:45.553 --> 07:47.880
Oh, your "ax"? Okay, so
did you guys play "gigs"

07:47.882 --> 07:48.998
and have "groupies"?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.433
Why do you think
we had a band?

07:50.435 --> 07:51.599
Honeys love musicians.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.881
I got so much...
personal attention

07:53.882 --> 07:55.030
in high school.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.705
Attention or detention?

07:56.707 --> 07:58.190
He's gonna be here
all week, folks.

07:58.192 --> 07:59.897
So what do we got?

07:59.899 --> 08:01.014
Eric and Nell

08:01.016 --> 08:02.497
found additional
surveillance footage

08:02.499 --> 08:03.965
from the garage's
exterior.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.162
Okay. And?

08:07.078 --> 08:08.402
Ouch.

08:11.993 --> 08:13.700
Wow.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.556
I like this girl.

08:15.558 --> 08:17.098
Yeah, that was impressive.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.308
That was professional.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.082
Never mind the guys.
Who is this woman?

08:20.084 --> 08:22.569
Exactly.

08:25.006 --> 08:27.127
Nell.

08:27.129 --> 08:28.420
Is Hetty upstairs?

08:28.422 --> 08:30.807
No. Why?

08:51.743 --> 08:53.897
You're injured?

08:57.098 --> 09:00.080
If you are,
I appreciate your efforts

09:00.082 --> 09:03.761
not to get any blood
on my furniture.

09:03.763 --> 09:06.960
How'd you know
I'd come here?

09:12.098 --> 09:14.999
How did you know
you'd be safe if you did?

09:25.807 --> 09:27.347
How bad is that?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.425
Won't be wearing

09:28.427 --> 09:30.530
a strapless gown anytime soon.

09:30.532 --> 09:31.905
Bones?

09:31.907 --> 09:33.563
No.

09:33.565 --> 09:35.586
It's just soft tissue.

09:35.588 --> 09:37.541
He only grazed me.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.481
You're lucky.

09:39.483 --> 09:41.884
It'll still need
medical attention.

09:41.886 --> 09:44.454
I'll settle for some scotch.

09:48.383 --> 09:50.006
Any walnuts?

09:50.008 --> 09:51.001
No.

09:51.003 --> 09:52.361
No bread crumbs either.

09:52.363 --> 09:54.018
She's holding out on us.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.510
What else is new?

09:55.512 --> 09:57.134
That mystery woman's the key.

09:57.136 --> 09:59.005
Yeah, Hetty's trying
to protect her.

09:59.007 --> 10:00.528
Question is: from who?

10:00.530 --> 10:01.738
I hate
when she does this.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.177
Sucks, don't it?
Yeah.

10:03.179 --> 10:05.580
Yeah, you two are cut
from the same cloth.

10:05.582 --> 10:07.070
Hardly.

10:07.072 --> 10:09.058
Hetty is, uh,
hand-painted silk.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.045
I'm more of a...
Itchy polyester?

10:11.047 --> 10:12.618
I was gonna
say denim.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.713
Well-worn denim.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.033
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.624
Any luck on Hetty?

10:19.626 --> 10:20.899
Nothing on her phone.

10:20.901 --> 10:23.350
She turned it off,
so we couldn't track her.

10:23.352 --> 10:25.453
She's off the reservation.

10:25.455 --> 10:26.778
Again.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.771
Yeah, but why?

10:27.773 --> 10:28.963
I think
we have to ask her.

10:28.965 --> 10:31.829
You got to
identify her first.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.396
Where's Nell?

10:34.398 --> 10:35.886
She had to run down
to the armory.

10:35.888 --> 10:36.847
For what?

10:36.849 --> 10:38.949
She didn't say.

10:44.168 --> 10:45.210
Whoa!

10:45.212 --> 10:46.949
You guys scared me.

10:46.951 --> 10:48.142
What you doing?

10:48.144 --> 10:50.823
Just, um, inventory.

10:50.825 --> 10:52.198
Mm-hmm.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.121
What's missing?

10:56.026 --> 10:58.031
The derringer and her arm rig.

10:59.381 --> 11:02.212
Plus her .32.

11:04.656 --> 11:08.986
Three knives, pepper spray
and a steel baton.

11:08.988 --> 11:11.313
What, no hand grenade?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.527
This is nowhere near as good

11:15.530 --> 11:18.948
as the Pu-erh you used
to bring me from Yunnan.

11:20.785 --> 11:22.909
But it'll have to suffice.

11:22.911 --> 11:25.858
Thank you.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.977
It's been awhile.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.297
Yeah.

11:32.299 --> 11:34.287
How long have you been in town?

11:34.289 --> 11:36.309
Not long.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.921
Long enough to leave
a couple of bodies.

11:40.923 --> 11:44.548
I ran out of options.

11:44.551 --> 11:46.806
Well, it happens.

11:49.531 --> 11:52.405
You should have called me
if you were in trouble.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.669
I'm here now.

11:56.671 --> 12:00.061
And I'm glad that you are.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.668
Ah, bugger.

12:07.670 --> 12:09.925
Hope she's talking about you.

12:09.926 --> 12:11.931
It's all right.

12:14.087 --> 12:16.946
Oh, well,
now that you're here,

12:16.948 --> 12:18.901
Mr. Hanna,
could you

12:18.903 --> 12:21.543
see to our guest's injuries?

12:21.545 --> 12:24.167
Let's take a look.

12:24.169 --> 12:26.958
You got a minute?

12:30.152 --> 12:33.159
This is where you tell me
what's going on.

12:33.161 --> 12:35.985
What would you like to know?

12:35.987 --> 12:39.128
Why don't we start with
the woman in the other room

12:39.130 --> 12:40.850
and what the hell
she's doing here.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.535
Well, her name is Grace Stevens.

12:44.537 --> 12:46.096
Mm-hmm.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.324
And I take it you have
a pretty good reason

12:48.326 --> 12:50.313
for not telling us
who we were looking for?

12:50.315 --> 12:52.542
I asked you to identify the men.

12:52.544 --> 12:53.815
Yeah, well,
that would have been

12:53.817 --> 12:55.852
a little easier had we known
who they were after.

12:55.854 --> 12:59.353
I told you,
her name is Grace Stevens.

12:59.355 --> 13:00.292
That's her name.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.139
I want to know
who the hell she is.

13:02.141 --> 13:04.797
She's one of ours.

13:07.344 --> 13:10.176
Now, why wouldn't you
want to tell me that?

13:24.831 --> 13:27.775
Nolan Vandenberg popped
up on our radar three years ago,

13:27.777 --> 13:29.907
when equipment from one of
his manufacturing facilities

13:29.909 --> 13:31.436
turned up in Iran.

13:31.438 --> 13:32.820
He said it was stolen.

13:32.822 --> 13:34.937
Now, the concern is that
he's providing equipment

13:34.939 --> 13:36.370
that could be used to facilitate

13:36.372 --> 13:38.343
the nuclear programs
of our enemies.

13:38.345 --> 13:40.730
We just haven't been
able to prove it.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.450
How long were you inside?

13:42.452 --> 13:44.232
I've been working for him
for 11 months.

13:44.234 --> 13:45.632
Living with him for three.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.364
My intel flow had dried up.

13:52.366 --> 13:55.500
He maintains control
through compartmentalization.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.964
His employees
only know enough

13:56.966 --> 13:59.246
to be efficient
in their specific area.

13:59.248 --> 14:01.028
So you figured you could gain
additional access

14:01.030 --> 14:03.791
if he trusted you
on a more intimate level.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.855
I was out of options.

14:06.857 --> 14:09.818
Unfortunately, all I learned
is he's an abusive sadist.

14:09.820 --> 14:11.615
Do we have enough to arrest him?

14:11.617 --> 14:13.364
No.

14:13.366 --> 14:15.644
If we arrest him,
we tip off those he's helping.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.225
The fear is there are
others in addition to Iran.

14:18.227 --> 14:19.606
If we take him out,

14:19.608 --> 14:21.023
they'll find another supplier,

14:21.025 --> 14:22.937
and it may take us
months to determine

14:22.939 --> 14:25.551
who they were and where they are
in their nuclear development.

14:25.553 --> 14:27.266
So what's the goal?

14:27.268 --> 14:28.798
We want to know
who he's supplying,

14:28.800 --> 14:31.461
and ideally allow him
to continue to do so

14:31.463 --> 14:33.508
in a manner that lets us
monitor his progress

14:33.510 --> 14:35.790
and delay it if necessary.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.623
Espionage and sabotage.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.490
Two of my
favorite pastimes.

14:40.492 --> 14:41.791
Well, unfortunately,

14:41.793 --> 14:43.991
after what happened last night,

14:43.993 --> 14:46.792
he may have already
fled the country.

14:50.793 --> 14:52.492
So we looked into
his business holdings,

14:52.494 --> 14:55.126
and recent land deeds show
that Vandenberg's company

14:55.128 --> 14:57.427
has purchased property
in the Tula industrial area.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.543
It's just north
of Mexico City.

14:59.545 --> 15:00.827
They say what for?

15:00.829 --> 15:04.344
Manufacturing of heat
transfer equipment, used in

15:04.346 --> 15:07.662
refining, petrochemical
and gas processing industries.

15:07.664 --> 15:09.545
It could be legit.

15:09.547 --> 15:10.679
Yeah, it could be.

15:10.681 --> 15:12.796
And it could also be a way
to move equipment

15:12.798 --> 15:14.346
into another country
without rousing suspicion.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.130
Who's gonna expect

15:16.132 --> 15:18.497
uranium refining technology
to come out of Mexico?

15:18.499 --> 15:20.514
Hmm.
Any luck tracking down

15:20.516 --> 15:22.347
the missing cargo van or
the other guy that Grace shot?

15:22.349 --> 15:23.547
Mm, no luck with the van,

15:23.549 --> 15:24.965
but he hasn't sought
medical attention

15:24.967 --> 15:26.515
at any local hospitals.

15:26.517 --> 15:28.266
Could've patched
himself up.

15:28.268 --> 15:29.548
Or he could be dead.

15:29.550 --> 15:30.833
What about Vandenberg?

15:30.835 --> 15:32.850
As far as I can
tell, he's still here.

15:32.852 --> 15:34.499
He has a three-
bedroom suite

15:34.501 --> 15:36.100
booked at the
Biltmore downtown.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.096
Good.

15:37.098 --> 15:38.794
Book us a room close to his.

15:38.796 --> 15:39.920
Okay, got it.

15:39.922 --> 15:41.976
You guys going
on a second honeymoon?

15:41.978 --> 15:43.560
No, you two are.

15:43.562 --> 15:44.947
Ah, okay.

15:44.949 --> 15:46.449
Nell, make that twins.

15:46.451 --> 15:47.429
Mm, now we're talking.

15:47.431 --> 15:48.621
Twins are on my bucket list.

15:48.623 --> 15:50.171
Beds. Twin beds.

15:50.173 --> 15:51.689
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, but...

15:51.691 --> 15:53.794
Meet you two in the armory.

15:53.796 --> 15:56.178
You say "twin beds,"
I say "twins."

15:56.180 --> 15:58.659
Feeling better?

15:58.661 --> 16:00.944
Never underestimate
the rejuvenating powers

16:00.946 --> 16:02.446
of a hot shower.

16:02.448 --> 16:03.883
Look, Vandenberg is
still here,

16:03.885 --> 16:05.711
so we're gonna go
check him out.

16:05.713 --> 16:06.788
You can watch from Ops.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.617
I'd be of more use
on the ground.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.494
It's not worth the risk
of him seeing you.

16:10.496 --> 16:12.730
Plus, you need to heal.

16:12.732 --> 16:14.248
Look, you'll be
in contact with us.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.484
You can see
almost everything we see.

16:16.486 --> 16:17.954
Okay.

16:17.956 --> 16:19.602
So, uh...

16:19.604 --> 16:22.774
how long have
you known Hetty?

16:22.776 --> 16:25.338
We go back
quite a ways.

16:25.340 --> 16:26.924
Did she bring you to NCIS?

16:26.926 --> 16:30.742
Yeah. I, uh, I wasn't on
a good career trajectory.

16:30.744 --> 16:33.409
Actually, I was in trouble
with the law as a juvie.

16:33.411 --> 16:35.624
And, uh, fortunately,
I met Hetty,

16:35.626 --> 16:38.692
and she steered me in
the right direction.

16:38.694 --> 16:41.133
Well, she has a way
of doing that.

16:41.135 --> 16:43.086
Yeah.

16:48.543 --> 16:50.581
Hey. So, I, uh, sent
the hotel layout

16:50.583 --> 16:51.803
to your phones.
Mm-hmm.

16:51.805 --> 16:53.075
And, um, I'll be
tapped into their

16:53.077 --> 16:54.557
surveillance feed by
the time you get back.

16:54.559 --> 16:55.812
Great.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.689
Can you find me some more
information on Grace?

16:58.691 --> 17:00.223
Sure, yeah.

17:00.225 --> 17:01.967
What do you need?

17:01.969 --> 17:05.105
Everything you can find on her
prior to joining NCIS.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.278
Am I going to get
in trouble for this?

17:08.280 --> 17:09.986
Course not.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.298
Just don't get caught.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.877
What?

17:13.878 --> 17:15.180
Oh, man.

17:15.182 --> 17:16.564
Oh, my God,
she's watching me.

17:16.566 --> 17:17.752
Just smile.

17:17.753 --> 17:19.380
But then she'll know
I'm up to something.

17:19.382 --> 17:21.058
Then don't smile.
Okay, but then she'll think

17:21.059 --> 17:22.034
I'm hiding something.

17:22.036 --> 17:24.263
Oh, man, look at
her looking at me.

17:24.266 --> 17:27.163
Granger was right, she's
got that Gorgon stare.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.312
What should I say
if she asks me what I'm doing?

17:29.314 --> 17:31.640
Callen?

17:31.642 --> 17:33.512
Ca...

17:35.254 --> 17:36.362
Hey.

17:36.364 --> 17:38.673
Just...

17:49.305 --> 17:51.096
Thank you, Kenneth.

17:51.097 --> 17:52.154
Thank you, sir.

17:52.156 --> 17:53.896
Is there anything
else I can get you?

17:53.898 --> 17:54.905
Um, I don't know.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.045
What do you think, honey?

17:56.047 --> 17:57.315
Huh? Little champagne?

17:57.317 --> 17:58.910
Chocolate-covered strawberries?

17:58.912 --> 18:01.112
Honey, you know I get hives
from strawberries

18:01.114 --> 18:02.807
and champagne gives me gas.

18:02.809 --> 18:03.892
Wow.

18:03.894 --> 18:05.942
That is adorable.

18:06.908 --> 18:08.059
My wife.

18:08.062 --> 18:09.364
Excuse me.
Yeah.

18:09.366 --> 18:10.686
Uh, wait.

18:10.688 --> 18:12.888
The-the threshold.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.328
Oh, right.

18:14.330 --> 18:16.057
The threshold.
Course.

18:16.059 --> 18:17.463
Uh...

18:17.465 --> 18:19.479
Um...
So excited.

18:19.481 --> 18:20.546
Well?

18:20.548 --> 18:21.614
You want to...

18:21.616 --> 18:23.224
want to jump up
or something, maybe?

18:23.226 --> 18:24.730
Okay, this is
not ice dancing.

18:24.732 --> 18:26.188
Just lift me up.
I mean,

18:26.190 --> 18:27.102
maybe you could hand me

18:27.104 --> 18:28.221
a leg or something
to hold on to.

18:28.223 --> 18:29.186
Just put your leg up.

18:29.188 --> 18:30.847
Just put your--
yeah, there you go.

18:30.849 --> 18:33.896
Right like... that.

18:33.898 --> 18:35.405
Um...

18:35.407 --> 18:37.167
Maybe you should
grab the other one.

18:37.169 --> 18:39.093
She's a lot heavier,
actually, than she looks.

18:39.095 --> 18:40.430
It's all that
very dense

18:40.432 --> 18:42.681
muscle mass from
pole dancing.

18:42.683 --> 18:44.231
That she does.
Yeah.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.292
He's kidding.

18:45.294 --> 18:46.189
I'm not really kidding.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.527
I almost lost my appendix

18:47.529 --> 18:49.729
the last time she tried to do
the Hungarian bicycle.

18:49.731 --> 18:50.920
It was crazy. On three.
On three.

18:50.922 --> 18:51.931
One, two...
Three.

18:51.933 --> 18:53.042
Ho!

18:53.044 --> 18:54.916
Wish me luck.
Uh, good luck.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.467
Yeah, I'm gonna need it.
And congratulations.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.560
Okay.
Thank you.

18:57.562 --> 18:59.387
Congratulations to us.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.349
Put me down.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.227
You laugh funny
and your eye looks weird.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.441
Uh-huh. Let me go.
Fire in the hole!

19:03.443 --> 19:04.472
No!

19:04.474 --> 19:05.520
Uh!

19:05.522 --> 19:07.461
I'm so sorry.

19:07.463 --> 19:08.611
That was too much.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.385
It was inappropriate.
I'm so sorry.

19:10.387 --> 19:11.651
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
you just did that.

19:11.653 --> 19:12.698
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.016
It was inappropriate.
Geez...!

19:14.018 --> 19:15.705
You're an agent, we're
in a working environment.

19:15.707 --> 19:17.056
What? No, Deeks, stop-- oh!

19:18.917 --> 19:20.384
Okay.
See, you know what?

19:20.386 --> 19:21.701
You got to have
faster reflexes than that.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.999
That's what happens
when you marry the jungle cat.

19:24.001 --> 19:24.414
Yeah.

19:24.439 --> 19:26.110
You want to make
little Ninja assassins.

19:26.111 --> 19:27.437
You want to play
this game.

19:27.439 --> 19:28.849
Obviously, you're
gonna have to... oh!

19:28.851 --> 19:30.159
You know what, sweetie, honey,

19:30.161 --> 19:31.487
this is how somebody gets hurt.

19:31.488 --> 19:33.035
Yeah. You.

19:33.036 --> 19:34.668
I don't want to see
you get hurt, honey.

19:34.669 --> 19:36.166
Ow! Don't... St...!

19:36.168 --> 19:37.357
Ow! Burn. You ca... Ow!

19:37.359 --> 19:38.872
Okay, don't
make me unleash the beast.

19:38.874 --> 19:41.016
Only thing beastly about you
is your breath.

19:41.018 --> 19:42.327
Dizzy... Kens...

19:42.329 --> 19:44.538
Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:44.540 --> 19:46.240
Sounds like the
honeymoon is over.

19:46.242 --> 19:47.346
You guys in position?

19:49.016 --> 19:50.206
Huh? Well, one of us is.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.862
Oh... Fraggle Rock!

19:52.864 --> 19:54.735
No-- ah!
Yeah?

19:54.737 --> 19:55.826
How you like that?

19:55.828 --> 19:56.885
I don't love it.
There you...

19:56.887 --> 19:57.911
I mean, I don't love it

19:57.913 --> 19:59.246
as much as I should love it!

19:59.248 --> 20:00.631
- You in position now, huh?
- No!

20:00.633 --> 20:02.177
Huh? You...
This is going a lot better...

20:02.179 --> 20:03.237
Hi.

20:03.239 --> 20:04.670
Ah!

20:04.672 --> 20:06.868
Is this a... bad time?

20:06.870 --> 20:07.959
Hello, you...

20:12.308 --> 20:13.985
He started it.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.672
Target is alone,

20:16.674 --> 20:18.496
but he's gotta have
some muscle nearby.

20:20.549 --> 20:22.372
You recognize
anyone, Grace?

20:22.374 --> 20:24.359
The guy with the
book is DeGroot.

20:24.361 --> 20:26.313
He's not the other one you shot?

20:26.315 --> 20:27.600
No, that was Visser.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.687
I don't see him.

20:28.689 --> 20:30.434
May not have survived.

20:30.436 --> 20:31.688
Good.

20:31.691 --> 20:33.047
The guy was a psychopath.

20:33.049 --> 20:35.440
I don't recognize anyone else.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.001
He's down three men.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.868
That makes him vulnerable.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.225
Also makes him dangerous

20:40.227 --> 20:42.347
and more likely to do
something unpredictable.

20:42.349 --> 20:44.077
Okay, Eric,

20:44.079 --> 20:45.623
we should be online.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.319
Yeah, we got you.

20:49.865 --> 20:51.086
Nobody's answering.

20:51.088 --> 20:52.494
No one answered when I knocked.

20:52.496 --> 20:53.751
Ready?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.668
Yup.
Right.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.416
Guys,
Nell's going in.

20:57.418 --> 21:00.216
Let us know if Vandenberg
or his protection move.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.914
Good luck.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.529
Thank you.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.644
Housekeeping!

21:34.994 --> 21:37.792
All right, no laptop
on the desk...

21:40.539 --> 21:42.203
Leave the briefcase.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.650
Yay.

21:45.916 --> 21:46.864
Hey, Doc.

21:46.866 --> 21:48.829
You got a laptop?

21:50.144 --> 21:51.659
No.

21:51.661 --> 21:54.572
It's audio and video
bug detection equipment.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.737
This guy's careful.

21:55.739 --> 21:57.069
Not careful enough.

21:57.071 --> 21:58.318
Can you disable it?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.183
With pleasure.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.787
Somebody's in here.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.655
That's Visser!
Get her out of there!

22:24.657 --> 22:27.452
Kensi, go, go.
Yeah.

22:29.101 --> 22:31.148
What are you doing?

22:32.031 --> 22:33.361
I am with Housekeeping.

22:33.363 --> 22:35.443
I am Housekeeping.

22:35.445 --> 22:38.939
I had the
"Do Not Disturb" sign on.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.104
I'm sorry, sir.

22:40.106 --> 22:42.268
I must have
missed that.

22:42.270 --> 22:44.217
I can just come back later.

22:44.219 --> 22:45.765
You've been going
through my stuff.

22:45.768 --> 22:48.045
No, no, I was just tidying up.

22:48.047 --> 22:50.343
Um, can I get you more towels?

22:50.345 --> 22:52.340
You were trying
to steal from me.

22:52.342 --> 22:54.455
No, I wasn't.

22:54.457 --> 22:58.001
Hello. Is there
a problem here?

22:58.003 --> 22:59.138
Who the hell are you?

22:59.140 --> 23:01.079
I'm Kelly Smith,
hotel management.

23:01.081 --> 23:02.801
We've been receiving complaints
from this floor

23:02.802 --> 23:04.396
that Housekeeping has
been walking in on guests

23:04.398 --> 23:06.369
even though the "Do Not
Disturb" sign was out.

23:06.371 --> 23:08.216
I caught her trying
to go through my stuff.

23:08.218 --> 23:09.637
I wasn't!
She's lying.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.816
Sir, if you could make a list
of all your personal effects

23:11.818 --> 23:13.063
that you think
might be missing...

23:13.065 --> 23:15.273
I don't think she had time
to take anything.

23:15.275 --> 23:16.963
Well, we can let
the police decide that.

23:16.965 --> 23:18.905
I'm not dealing
with the police.

23:18.906 --> 23:20.420
I'm on a tight schedule.

23:20.422 --> 23:21.478
I don't have time
for that.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.978
Understood, sir.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.788
On behalf of the hotel,
we'd like to offer you

23:25.790 --> 23:28.267
a complimentary night's stay
as a sign of our appreciation.

23:28.269 --> 23:30.873
Sure. Fine.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.640
Just... get her out of here.

23:32.642 --> 23:34.029
Of course. Rita.

23:35.341 --> 23:37.107
Once again, sir,
I'm terribly sorry.

23:37.109 --> 23:39.744
Mm-hmm.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.105
Are we cool up there?

23:59.107 --> 24:00.399
That was a close call,

24:00.401 --> 24:01.583
but I think we're good.

24:01.585 --> 24:02.814
Vandenberg's

24:02.816 --> 24:04.298
got company.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.735
You know these guys, Grace?

24:05.737 --> 24:07.631
Negative.

24:07.633 --> 24:08.988
I've never
seen them before.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.015
Maybe they're replacements
for the guys he lost.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.973
I'm running them
through facial rec.

24:12.975 --> 24:16.486
Our boy's got a briefcase.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.057
Laptop's probably inside.

24:18.059 --> 24:20.692
What are the chances of getting
that away long enough

24:20.694 --> 24:22.566
to the access the computer?

24:22.568 --> 24:25.387
Creating a distraction and
grabbing the case-- ten seconds.

24:25.389 --> 24:28.257
Breaking the combination,
if it's locked-- another 20.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.166
Copying the files-- two minutes.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.974
Outsmarting the bad guys?

24:31.976 --> 24:33.324
Priceless.

24:33.326 --> 24:34.895
I got a match

24:34.897 --> 24:36.196
on his lunch dates.

24:36.198 --> 24:38.477
They both have diplomatic
status in the U.S.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.637
The man on Vandenberg's
right is Ettiene Indongo.

24:40.639 --> 24:42.108
He's an attaché from Niger.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.353
The other man is
Ousamane Ndakolo.

24:44.355 --> 24:45.957
He's Namibian.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.309
I doubt it's coincidence

24:47.311 --> 24:49.790
that Niger and Namibia happen
to be the world's third

24:49.793 --> 24:52.240
and fourth largest exporters
of uranium.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.811
Vandenberg could be expanding
his enterprises

24:53.813 --> 24:55.483
into raw materials.

24:55.485 --> 24:58.826
We're going to need all hands
on deck for this.

24:58.829 --> 25:01.226
Kensi and Deeks,
you're the distraction.

25:01.228 --> 25:03.269
Copy that.

25:03.271 --> 25:05.211
I will grab the case
and hand it to Nell.

25:05.213 --> 25:08.270
Nell, you're gonna need to
clone it and get it back to me.

25:08.272 --> 25:09.615
Sam will remain
in over-watch position

25:09.617 --> 25:11.311
in case anything goes wrong.

25:11.313 --> 25:13.588
Okay, well, something may have
already gone wrong.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.918
Visser's leaving his hotel room.

25:14.920 --> 25:15.965
We may have spooked him.

25:15.967 --> 25:16.929
Can you stall him?

25:16.931 --> 25:19.406
I'll try.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.614
Ah, excuse me.

25:22.616 --> 25:24.243
Do you have a moment?
No.

25:24.245 --> 25:26.055
I just need a second
of your time, sir.

25:26.057 --> 25:27.402
I need you to
sign a statement

25:27.404 --> 25:28.713
regarding what
happened in your room.

25:28.715 --> 25:30.178
I don't have time right now.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.872
Please, sir.
This will only take 30 seconds.

25:31.874 --> 25:33.867
I just need a witness
to corroborate my report

25:33.869 --> 25:34.965
for Human Resources.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.328
Maybe later.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.873
Of course. Have a good day, sir.

25:39.486 --> 25:41.529
Visser's on his way down.
I couldn't stall him.

25:50.506 --> 25:51.752
Deeks, you good?

25:51.754 --> 25:53.032
Yup.

25:53.034 --> 25:55.525
Nell?
I think so.

25:55.527 --> 25:57.237
You'll be fine.
Just stay frosty.

25:57.239 --> 25:58.932
Kens, how much time we got?

25:58.934 --> 26:00.895
Seconds.

26:01.759 --> 26:04.584
What do you think?

26:13.777 --> 26:15.720
I have Visser.

26:15.722 --> 26:18.098
I can take him out.
Just say the word.

26:22.505 --> 26:25.112
Are we doing this?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.359
G?

26:31.418 --> 26:32.420
Abort.

26:32.422 --> 26:34.629
Everyone walk away now.

27:13.410 --> 27:15.500
What about these two guys?

27:15.502 --> 27:17.340
Couldn't we track
Vandenberg through them?

27:17.342 --> 27:18.745
They're both
foreign diplomats,

27:18.747 --> 27:20.887
which means they probably
have immunity in this country.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.447
Plus, the minute we contact
them, he knows we're onto them.

27:23.449 --> 27:24.735
Yeah.
Infiltrating Vandenberg

27:24.737 --> 27:26.157
without him knowing
would be great,

27:26.159 --> 27:28.950
but at some point, we may
have to give up on that

27:28.952 --> 27:30.138
and just
bring him in.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.260
Yeah, Sam's right.

27:31.262 --> 27:32.682
At the very least,
we stop them

27:32.684 --> 27:33.936
from providing equipment
to our enemies.

27:33.938 --> 27:35.693
Well, we could also turn that
to our advantage.

27:35.695 --> 27:36.948
Well, how so?

27:36.950 --> 27:38.169
With Vandenberg
out of the picture,

27:38.171 --> 27:39.156
they'll just seek
another supplier.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.462
Exactly, and that could be us.

27:40.464 --> 27:42.167
I mean, we, uh,
create a bogus company

27:42.170 --> 27:43.523
that's willing
to supply the same equipment.

27:43.525 --> 27:45.480
Then we control
what it is we give 'em.

27:45.482 --> 27:47.849
We know exactly where they are
in their nuclear development.

27:49.329 --> 27:51.386
No?

27:51.388 --> 27:52.674
Damn.

27:52.676 --> 27:54.213
That's a good idea, Deeks.

27:54.215 --> 27:57.196
You don't have to sound
surprised by that.

27:57.198 --> 27:58.539
Not just another
pretty rock star, huh?

27:58.541 --> 27:59.848
What's that mean?

27:59.850 --> 28:01.936
Nothing. It means nothing.
She's talking crazy.

28:01.938 --> 28:04.422
It's a good idea.

28:04.424 --> 28:06.825
Unfortunately, we have
no idea where Vandenberg is.

28:10.257 --> 28:11.333
How we making out?

28:11.335 --> 28:12.774
Uh, less than zero.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.432
Nothing on the
van or Vandenberg.

28:14.434 --> 28:16.521
I don't know how
they left the hotel.

28:16.523 --> 28:18.095
There are, like, a dozen exits.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.735
We're monitoring
airport checkpoints,

28:19.737 --> 28:21.410
but nothing so far. Sorry.

28:21.412 --> 28:23.563
It's okay. All right,
keep working on it.

28:23.565 --> 28:25.039
Hey...

28:25.041 --> 28:26.630
uh, I just wanted to thank you

28:26.632 --> 28:28.735
for your confidence
in me, Agent Callen.

28:30.526 --> 28:32.430
What is this?

28:32.432 --> 28:34.088
I'm sorry?
What's what?

28:34.090 --> 28:35.248
What is this?

28:35.250 --> 28:37.021
Oh, I-I don't know.
Where did you find it?

28:37.023 --> 28:38.794
You just gave this to me.

28:38.796 --> 28:40.998
I did? How could
I have done that? That...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.451
Maybe somebody left it
on my desk here, and...

28:43.453 --> 28:44.695
Is this Grace's history?

28:44.697 --> 28:46.269
How would I know?
I don't eve...

28:46.271 --> 28:47.927
I don't even know
what we're talking about.

28:47.929 --> 28:48.871
I'm totally confused right now.

28:48.873 --> 28:50.395
Eric, relax.

28:50.397 --> 28:51.371
What did you find?

28:51.373 --> 28:53.440
You should probably read it.

28:53.442 --> 28:55.964
I will, I will; I just want
to hear your interpretation.

28:55.966 --> 28:58.739
Why? Nell is the analyst.
I'm just a technical operator.

28:58.741 --> 29:01.044
I'm just a techie.
I find data, I steal data,

29:01.046 --> 29:03.011
I decrypt data,
I do not analyze data...

29:03.013 --> 29:04.121
Eric, what did you find?

29:04.123 --> 29:06.543
Nothing... exactly.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.394
It's just that...

29:08.396 --> 29:10.547
her past seemed
surprisingly similar

29:10.549 --> 29:12.616
to some other agents.

29:12.618 --> 29:13.828
What other agents?

29:13.830 --> 29:15.846
Sullivan, Hunter...

29:15.848 --> 29:17.864
you.

29:22.508 --> 29:26.055
You hiding in here?

29:26.057 --> 29:28.293
No. Just looking
for a little peace and quiet

29:28.295 --> 29:30.867
so I can concentrate.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.835
You guys find Vandenberg?

29:32.837 --> 29:34.853
Not yet.

29:34.855 --> 29:36.838
You good?

29:36.840 --> 29:39.395
Don't I seem good?

29:39.397 --> 29:41.463
You seem a little off your game.

29:45.519 --> 29:47.722
Would you have made
a different call at the hotel?

29:47.724 --> 29:50.463
Maybe.

29:50.465 --> 29:53.355
Doesn't mean it would've
been the right one.

29:55.258 --> 29:57.276
What's going on?

29:57.278 --> 29:58.857
Nothing.

29:58.858 --> 30:00.774
You're worried
about getting dressing up

30:00.776 --> 30:02.388
for the birthday party?

30:02.390 --> 30:04.845
Yeah, that's what it is.

30:05.754 --> 30:07.872
Okay. Well, when you're ready,

30:07.874 --> 30:09.891
you'll let me know
what it really is.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.578
There's nothing
to tell you.

30:11.580 --> 30:13.893
Right.

30:25.668 --> 30:28.081
You said Grace was one of ours.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.726
She is.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.711
Not ours. Yours.

30:32.713 --> 30:35.258
She was an orphan.

30:37.094 --> 30:39.938
Turns out, so was the first
agent you lost-- Sullivan.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.864
Just like Hunter, just like me.

30:42.866 --> 30:44.815
Unfortunately,
there a lot of children

30:44.817 --> 30:47.131
in the world without parents,
Mr. Callen.

30:47.133 --> 30:49.098
And how many of them
have you recruited?

30:50.307 --> 30:52.505
You know what they say, Hetty.

30:52.507 --> 30:54.606
Once is happenstance.

30:54.608 --> 30:56.920
Twice is coincidence.

30:57.964 --> 30:59.253
Three times is enemy action.

30:59.255 --> 31:01.732
I don't like your tone,
Mr. Callen.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.022
Then tell me I'm wrong.

31:03.024 --> 31:04.313
Tell me you didn't

31:04.315 --> 31:06.676
pluck her out of an orphanage
and train her

31:06.678 --> 31:10.166
or mentor her or whatever
the hell you call what you do.

31:12.796 --> 31:14.796
I gave her an opportunity,

31:14.798 --> 31:16.566
an education,

31:16.568 --> 31:17.558
a family.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.848
In return for what?

31:18.850 --> 31:21.411
Perhaps that's a question
for her.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.932
Well, maybe, I'll ask her.

31:24.207 --> 31:26.405
I'd ask Sullivan and Hunter,
but they're both dead.

31:26.407 --> 31:28.803
Tread carefully, Mr. Callen.

31:28.805 --> 31:29.784
How many?

31:29.786 --> 31:32.041
This conversation is over.

31:32.043 --> 31:35.394
How many were there like Hunter
and Grace and me?

31:35.396 --> 31:37.307
I suggest you stand down.

31:37.309 --> 31:39.516
How many?!
A lot!

32:05.146 --> 32:08.088
Is that what you wanted to hear?

32:11.312 --> 32:14.157
There were...

32:14.159 --> 32:17.020
a lot.

33:10.098 --> 33:11.929
I messed up
this assignment.

33:11.931 --> 33:14.137
I'm sorry I had to drag
your team into this.

33:14.139 --> 33:15.854
You didn't mess up anything.

33:15.856 --> 33:17.049
Oh, no?

33:17.050 --> 33:19.975
Can't say I've ever seen
Hetty snap like that.

33:19.977 --> 33:21.874
That had nothing
to do with this case.

33:22.725 --> 33:24.653
I love her; I really do.

33:24.655 --> 33:26.617
I wanted to <i>be</i> her.

33:26.619 --> 33:28.415
But now she just scares me.

33:28.417 --> 33:30.133
Well, she scares
a lot of people.

33:30.135 --> 33:33.403
Though you don't strike me
as someone who spooks easy.

33:33.405 --> 33:35.938
No, she scares me
because when I look at her

33:35.940 --> 33:38.016
I see myself
in a few years.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.216
We should all be so lucky.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.572
You think?

33:41.574 --> 33:42.647
Look...

33:42.649 --> 33:45.343
Look, this Vandenberg case
has been hard on you.

33:45.345 --> 33:47.775
You just need
time to decompress.

33:47.777 --> 33:50.173
Well, the time that
I need is long gone.

33:51.299 --> 33:52.323
You're not married?

33:52.325 --> 33:53.862
No.

33:53.864 --> 33:55.879
Girlfriend?

33:55.881 --> 33:57.698
Not at the moment.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.269
So how many moments
have there been?

34:00.511 --> 34:02.494
Sorry.

34:02.496 --> 34:04.033
None of my business.

34:04.035 --> 34:05.969
It's just that
my longest relationship

34:05.971 --> 34:07.870
has been undercover...
with criminals.

34:07.872 --> 34:09.558
Okay, so forget
about Mr. Right.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.764
I mean, Mr. Murderer,

34:10.766 --> 34:12.831
Mr. Terrorist,
Mr. Drug Trafficker...

34:12.833 --> 34:15.362
those are my guys.

34:15.364 --> 34:18.422
Look, sometimes we make
bad choices for good reasons.

34:18.425 --> 34:20.243
It's part of this job.

34:20.245 --> 34:22.507
But you saved a lot of lives.

34:24.576 --> 34:27.106
Well, that's become my mantra.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.917
It's all for the mission.

34:29.918 --> 34:32.184
Unfortunately, there's
always another mission,

34:32.186 --> 34:34.697
another criminal
to go after, you know?

34:34.699 --> 34:36.054
So when do you stop?

34:36.056 --> 34:38.215
When somebody finally
puts a bullet in your head?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.505
Vandenberg still wants you dead.

34:42.507 --> 34:45.605
Yeah... so I got that
going for me.

34:45.607 --> 34:46.811
He wants to kill you.

34:46.813 --> 34:49.607
Okay, this isn't making me
feel any better.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.467
It might if it helps us
catch him.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.148
<i>Firefighters have</i>

34:54.150 --> 34:56.476
knocked down the blaze
and expect to have it

34:56.478 --> 34:58.419
under control
within the hour.

34:58.421 --> 35:00.128
Drivers are cautioned,
meantime...

35:00.130 --> 35:01.470
Has it aired yet?

35:01.472 --> 35:03.010
It's coming up.

35:03.012 --> 35:04.401
...until tomorrow morning.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.025
What about the others?
In other news,

35:06.027 --> 35:07.784
the police are asking for...
They're in position.

35:07.786 --> 35:09.511
...the public's help
in identifying the victim

35:09.513 --> 35:10.599
of a vicious assault.

35:10.601 --> 35:13.447
The woman shown here
was found in an alley

35:13.449 --> 35:16.178
by city workers late last night.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.886
She had no identification

35:17.888 --> 35:20.786
and remains in a coma
at St. Anne's Hospital.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.209
Anyone with information

35:22.211 --> 35:26.448
is asked to call the LAPD
anonymous tip hotline.

35:48.178 --> 35:50.471
Need you to sign off
on your transpo.

35:51.477 --> 35:52.766
It's been two hours.

35:52.768 --> 35:55.548
Maybe they aren't
watching the news.

36:03.288 --> 36:04.946
Excuse me.

36:04.948 --> 36:06.590
I think my fiancée
was admitted here.

36:06.592 --> 36:08.588
What's her name?
Grace.

36:08.590 --> 36:10.096
She's your Jane Doe.

36:11.214 --> 36:13.534
Oh.

36:13.536 --> 36:14.516
Wow, that's amazing.

36:14.518 --> 36:16.380
We... we were hoping
someone would help.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.158
She didn't have any
identification on her.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.174
Can I see her?

36:19.176 --> 36:21.410
The visiting hours are over,

36:21.412 --> 36:24.458
but I'll make an exception,
under the circumstances.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.136
Your friends are gonna have
to wait out here, however.

36:26.138 --> 36:27.304
That's fine.

36:27.306 --> 36:28.913
Right this way.

36:28.915 --> 36:31.369
She doesn't have any
drug allergies, does she?

36:31.371 --> 36:33.063
No.
Okay.

36:42.125 --> 36:43.852
How's she doing?

36:43.854 --> 36:45.799
Better now.

36:45.801 --> 36:47.798
Federal Agents.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.168
Hello again.

36:55.625 --> 36:56.859
Don't even think about it,

36:56.861 --> 36:58.976
unless you want to end up
on one of these gurneys.

36:58.978 --> 37:01.245
Or you want me to mop the floor
with your blood.

37:02.432 --> 37:03.465
What?

37:03.467 --> 37:05.277
You're trying too hard.

37:05.279 --> 37:07.056
Turn around.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.969
Hands behind your back.

37:10.105 --> 37:12.153
Nice work.

37:12.155 --> 37:14.520
Thanks. All of you.

37:14.522 --> 37:15.936
You're welcome.

37:15.938 --> 37:18.352
Hey, so, uh...
just for the record,

37:18.354 --> 37:20.984
this is the last time I'm going
undercover as a janitor.

37:20.986 --> 37:22.101
Ha! Yeah.

37:22.103 --> 37:23.183
I'm serious.

37:23.185 --> 37:24.400
This outfit--

37:24.402 --> 37:27.216
silver, super itchy...

37:44.562 --> 37:45.645
We got him...

37:45.647 --> 37:48.144
Vandenberg.

37:48.146 --> 37:51.643
He's in the boatshed
with Grace and Sam.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.391
I'm not sure if he's gonna
cooperate, but we're gonna try.

37:54.393 --> 37:56.341
Well done.

38:07.872 --> 38:09.671
The last time
somebody offered me

38:09.673 --> 38:11.670
50-year-old whiskey,

38:11.672 --> 38:13.303
they tried to kill me.

38:13.305 --> 38:17.752
Well, I can think
of worse ways to go.

38:22.035 --> 38:25.133
I apologize...

38:25.135 --> 38:27.365
for losing my temper.

38:28.916 --> 38:30.498
I shouldn't have baited you.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.981
No, you shouldn't have.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.796
What are we drinking to?

38:37.798 --> 38:41.295
The fact that we still can.

38:49.628 --> 38:50.826
Wow.

38:55.210 --> 38:58.529
Have you ever heard of
Vinnistya,

38:58.531 --> 38:59.724
in the Ukraine?

38:59.726 --> 39:02.830
Hitler had a headquarters
near there.

39:02.832 --> 39:04.790
It was code-named Werewolf.

39:04.792 --> 39:06.617
Yes.

39:06.619 --> 39:10.602
And years later the Soviets
built a town there,

39:10.604 --> 39:12.959
where everything--
houses, cars,

39:12.961 --> 39:15.999
theaters, restaurants,
even the people--

39:16.001 --> 39:17.626
were American.

39:17.628 --> 39:20.034
A Mayberry behind
the Iron Curtain.

39:20.036 --> 39:23.190
I always thought that was
an urban spy legend.

39:23.192 --> 39:25.581
Hmm, yes, well...

39:25.583 --> 39:28.835
there are those
who say that about me.

39:30.248 --> 39:31.658
The town was built

39:31.660 --> 39:35.760
to train operatives
to work in the West.

39:35.762 --> 39:38.367
But the Soviets soon realized

39:38.369 --> 39:40.027
that it was much more effective

39:40.029 --> 39:42.535
to create agents from scratch.

39:42.537 --> 39:45.591
So they started a school.

39:45.593 --> 39:48.763
Young Soviet children went in...

39:48.765 --> 39:51.154
and sleeper agents came out.

39:51.156 --> 39:55.189
Sleeper agents that looked
and sounded like Americans.

39:55.191 --> 39:58.727
And were schooled in spycraft

39:58.729 --> 40:02.796
and the finer arts of...
seduction.

40:02.798 --> 40:05.269
The males were called <i>voron,</i>

40:05.271 --> 40:07.196
and the females, <i>lebed'.</i>

40:07.198 --> 40:09.966
Ravens and swans.

40:11.259 --> 40:12.867
They were charming,

40:12.869 --> 40:17.427
smart and highly effective.

40:18.308 --> 40:19.883
Is that where they found you?

40:19.885 --> 40:23.282
You think I look like a swan,
Mr. Callen?

40:27.759 --> 40:31.192
Were the children... orphans?

40:31.194 --> 40:32.834
No, no.

40:32.836 --> 40:35.421
This was the USSR.

40:35.423 --> 40:38.157
It was a great honor
to have a family member

40:38.159 --> 40:40.445
in service of
the Communist party...

40:40.447 --> 40:44.127
or so was one was
led to believe.

40:44.129 --> 40:47.527
It'd be a lot harder to sell
that to an American family.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.312
Mm...

40:53.248 --> 40:56.199
Orphans, on the other hand...

40:56.201 --> 40:59.566
...could slip
through the cracks,

40:59.568 --> 41:02.152
if no one was there
to catch them.

41:09.832 --> 41:12.451
There were many factors
that conspired

41:12.453 --> 41:15.584
against me having my own family.

41:20.993 --> 41:24.922
But I did my very best

41:24.924 --> 41:28.454
to take care of those who fell
under my wing.

41:34.176 --> 41:36.911
I think you would have made
a great mother, Hetty.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.472
Thank you, Mr. Callen.
I'd like to think I have.
