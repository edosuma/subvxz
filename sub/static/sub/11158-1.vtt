01:54.573 --> 01:56.507
He's like..bap-bap-bap-bap-bap!

01:56.642 --> 01:58.701
I give him a tap.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.482
Oh, man..

02:05.584 --> 02:08.610
I thought God was gonna shoot
pool with the nigger's balls.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.416
You know what I mean?
I know we was out in Chalet.

02:11.523 --> 02:14.219
Shit was benini.

02:14.326 --> 02:16.385
And then my man J. back there
think he's wild in' out,

02:16.495 --> 02:18.690
'cause we already know
each other like that.

02:18.797 --> 02:21.095
God got an ill sense of humor,
you know what I mean?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.430
How come God make a man strip
before he beat him down?

02:23.569 --> 02:25.400
Yo, let me tell you
somethin, G'

02:25.504 --> 02:28.735
God say a beatin' don't
mean shit to a nigger.

02:28.874 --> 02:32.275
Take a man's dignity away
and strip him down naked, humiliate him,

02:32.377 --> 02:34.277
he'll never forget that,
you know what I'm sayin'?

02:34.379 --> 02:36.540
That's some psychological
ill shit, you know what I mean?

02:36.648 --> 02:40.311
That's life, though, right
there. I can get with that.

02:40.419 --> 02:43.217
- How much this kid
come up short, though?
- God's like,

02:43.322 --> 02:45.517
he told the crack head,
stop doin' all the wild shit.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.252
He's still sucking on the glass
dick. All that's irrelevant,

02:48.360 --> 02:51.227
because we ain't gonna
lay him down, you is.

02:51.330 --> 02:54.959
You know what I mean?
You the new kid on the block.
You gots to earn your stripes.

02:55.067 --> 02:57.399
- What you talking about, man?
- What you mean,
what I'm talking about?

02:57.536 --> 03:01.165
- Keepin' it real with us, right?
- You know I am.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.171
Then you ain't got
nothin' to worry about.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.141
So he's gotta make sure his
angel's got wings. nigger, fly.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.739
Here comes the exciting part.

03:09.882 --> 03:14.581
After months of hard work,
you're finally where you wanna be.

03:14.686 --> 03:18.622
You're deep enough inside
so that the boys want to test you.

03:18.724 --> 03:23.161
Now, they want you to prove
that you're down, right?

03:23.262 --> 03:25.492
No. Absolutely wrong.

03:25.597 --> 03:28.498
What they really want you to
prove is that you're not a cop.

03:30.102 --> 03:32.002
What do you do?

03:33.405 --> 03:35.373
Aw, come on.
Anybody?

03:36.775 --> 03:38.743
Huh. At least we got
one courageous cadet.

03:38.877 --> 03:41.607
Come on down here, rook.
Show me what you got.

03:41.713 --> 03:44.011
Now, check it out. crimson baby.

03:44.116 --> 03:46.550
Main man gonna hang you the honor
of blastin' this punk.

03:46.652 --> 03:48.847
He's skimmin' off the top.
We can't have that.

03:48.954 --> 03:52.481
- What's up?
- I'll just hand
the honor right back.

03:52.591 --> 03:55.116
I mean, it's the man's
beef, not mine.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.252
It's not the way
the game is played.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.489
You see, the man's beef...

03:59.598 --> 04:01.725
is always your beef.

04:03.335 --> 04:05.235
And you know what else?

04:05.337 --> 04:09.000
If you ain't one of us,
you must be one of them.

04:09.107 --> 04:13.134
Your stupid ass is dead.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.510
Is that Play skool enough
for you to understand?

04:15.614 --> 04:19.447
- You gots to earn
your stripes, baby.
- Make me proud.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.849
No problems.
Show me where the kid at.

04:21.954 --> 04:24.718
Don't you worry about it,
man. We're gonna roll by
his place of employment...

04:24.823 --> 04:27.792
sort a "in cog-negro."

04:29.261 --> 04:31.195
Then we going to see
if we got the right one, baby.

04:31.296 --> 04:34.788
Let me showy' all Cincinnati cats
how to wet a nigga up right.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.925
That's what
I'm talk in 'about.

04:37.035 --> 04:40.163
- Right there?
- Right there. All right. Hold up.

04:41.175 --> 04:42.739
Black cap.
Black cap right there.

04:42.874 --> 04:44.865
Whoo-oo!

04:45.010 --> 04:47.410
Yo, roll up.
Yo, roll up close, man.

04:47.512 --> 04:49.537
I want to see the whites
in this cat's eyes.

04:49.648 --> 04:53.015
There he is, right in front of you.

04:53.118 --> 04:57.282
Just a little punk.
Can't keep his nose
out of the cookie jar.

04:57.389 --> 04:59.323
What you gonna do?

05:07.833 --> 05:11.360
You just got yourself
in so deep that you'll
never be able to get out.

05:13.205 --> 05:15.605
He didn't pose
an immediate threat.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.437
For God's sake, you didn't even
check to see if he was armed.

05:20.078 --> 05:23.844
You all know what that is?
That's premeditated murder, Cadet.

05:28.587 --> 05:32.079
You're hold in' that gun.
Time is runnin' out.

05:32.190 --> 05:33.782
- We out.
- What you talk about?

05:33.892 --> 05:36.190
Your brain vaporized
like ten minutes ago.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.389
Your heart's dancin'
on your tongue.

05:39.498 --> 05:42.695
Your life depends on
split-second decisions.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.292
You better do somethin'
and you better do it now.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.441
Damn! Go!

06:00.352 --> 06:02.843
- You ain't hit him yet?
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.577
Let's get the fuck out.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.170
- Why you ain't givin' me no co-op, man?
- You can't shoot worth nothin'.

06:30.282 --> 06:33.080
- Yo, I had the kid right there, man.
- You ain't nothin' but a talker.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.847
Yo, turn the car around.
Give me a little co-op.

06:35.954 --> 06:39.856
Face up, bro. You whack.
Can't shoot. What?

06:39.958 --> 06:42.153
My boy got a crazy heart.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.956
I got a heart.
Ain't gonna was temyammo.

06:52.404 --> 06:55.498
- Move over there.
- No, you come on up here.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.631
Just..Just come on.

06:57.776 --> 07:00.176
Come on, man. What you doin'?

07:00.278 --> 07:03.008
Come on. Get yourself
in the picture with your mother.

07:03.115 --> 07:05.549
Jeffery.
Jeffery.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.811
- Give me the camera.
- Give your sister the camera.

07:07.919 --> 07:10.945
- Go up there with your family.
- Let me take..

07:11.056 --> 07:13.115
No! Go ahead.

07:20.866 --> 07:22.766
Ready?

07:22.868 --> 07:25.302
I'm gonna go,
catch a football game.

07:25.437 --> 07:28.304
Okay. Nice to meet you all.
It's okay.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.542
Wait a minute.

07:32.677 --> 07:34.611
- Captain D'Ambrosio.
- What's up?

07:34.746 --> 07:37.408
I was wondering if I could stop by
your office tomorrow.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.810
You saw the memo
on my bulletin board?

07:41.920 --> 07:45.720
- How'd you know?
- Because three other rookies already
talked to me about the job today.

07:45.824 --> 07:48.292
I'm sure I'd be better
than any of those guys.

07:48.393 --> 07:51.191
Really? What makes you think you'd be
so good at undercover work?

07:51.296 --> 07:54.527
My mother says I'm damn good at makin'
anyone believe anything, you know.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.533
Oh, your mother.

07:56.635 --> 07:59.661
Listen. I grew up in community
housing back in Cleveland.

07:59.871 --> 08:04.443
So growing up in the projects..
that doesn't automatically qualify you.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.877
- You know what a street gang does?
- Mm-hmm.

08:06.978 --> 08:08.878
There's big players
out here, man.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.948
They're gonna believe
I need in.

08:11.082 --> 08:13.482
Nobody knows me in Cincinnati.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.945
Be in my office
tomorrow, 4:00.

08:17.055 --> 08:19.649
You know, you wear your shooting badge
on the wrong side of your uniform.

08:19.758 --> 08:22.124
I don't expect I'll be wear in' it
after tomorrow, sir.

08:35.907 --> 08:37.807
Here we go.

08:37.909 --> 08:41.436
Attention on a 1-0-5.
Repeat, 1-0-5. All units.

08:41.546 --> 08:43.446
Check out this walk,
Wilson.

08:43.548 --> 08:45.914
They're gonna figure him
for a narc a mile away.

08:46.017 --> 08:49.145
Cut the brother
some slack, will you?

08:49.254 --> 08:51.381
This is his first
time on the street.

09:02.901 --> 09:04.835
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

09:04.936 --> 09:07.234
Got some shit?

09:07.339 --> 09:10.308
I don't know you, man. Take that
shit down the block or somethin'.

09:10.442 --> 09:13.434
The sepunks ain't gonna
deal this rookie jack shit.

09:13.578 --> 09:15.478
- Is this a joke or somethin', man?
- Go down the block, man.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.141
- You know this nigger here?
- No, son. I don't know this nigger.

09:19.251 --> 09:22.277
What's up, man? You a
po-po nigger? What's up?

09:22.387 --> 09:24.218
I ain't no mother
fuckin' po-po.

09:24.322 --> 09:26.449
Nigger, you sure
smell like you po-po.

09:26.525 --> 09:30.484
You out your mother
fuckin' mind, man.

09:31.897 --> 09:34.730
- Fuck, nigger. What's up?
- Oh, shit.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.996
Told you this Puerto Rican nose
can smell heat a mile away.

09:39.104 --> 09:42.471
I ain't fuckin' with you cats.
You out here with a little
Crackerjack knife.

09:42.574 --> 09:45.372
- Nigger, fuck you, man.
- Fuck you, nigger. You don't know me.

09:45.477 --> 09:47.707
Chill out.
Chill. Chill. All right?

09:47.812 --> 09:50.713
What's up, man?
You buy in' or what?

09:50.815 --> 09:52.715
Come on.

09:54.152 --> 09:56.586
Damn. Yo.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.555
- All right?
- Yeah.

10:04.663 --> 10:08.030
Yeah! Well,
your Puerto Ricannose...

10:08.133 --> 10:10.158
is gettin' as old
as your concepcion.

10:10.302 --> 10:13.032
The rook detective bought
his first time out.

10:20.612 --> 10:22.546
- What's up, Cap'n?
- How you doin'?

10:22.681 --> 10:26.617
Hey, Pres, man, couldn't you
find a warm coffee shop...

10:26.718 --> 10:29.152
or someplace we
can be just as safe?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.722
I like this view
of Cincinnati.

10:31.823 --> 10:35.259
You can bring a cup of
coffee with you if you want to.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.794
I don't understand why we
have to meet every week.

10:37.896 --> 10:41.332
Because talking on the telephone
is not enough for undercover work.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.594
You gotta be able to
unload face to face.

10:43.735 --> 10:47.603
Unload what, man? I made a buy
and bust on my first try out.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.606
I'd say I was doin'
pretty good, huh?

10:49.708 --> 10:52.233
I would say the department
is doing pretty good.

10:52.344 --> 10:54.710
- That would be the way I would put it.
- Right. Right. Excuse me.

10:54.813 --> 10:58.909
Look, the point is, I got..
We got some crack off the street.

10:59.017 --> 11:02.214
Yep, we did. About a
rat's nostril's worth.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.313
That much. And two hours later,
that corner was back in business.

11:06.424 --> 11:09.484
So then what are we doin' here?
Let's go bust 'em again.

11:09.594 --> 11:12.927
And again and again until they
get the goddamn point, man.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.696
- Yep.
- What?

12:03.014 --> 12:06.347
- Time out, dog.
- Wake up, baby. Wake up.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.877
- What's up with this, man?
- What the fuck you think?

12:09.988 --> 12:12.980
I'm sayin', man, you don'tjust
bust in here like that.
What's goin' on?

12:13.091 --> 12:16.686
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there's a problem.
Some shit can't wait.

12:16.795 --> 12:20.196
Yo, I can see that, man.
It must be pretty important, right?

12:20.298 --> 12:22.528
Stop a brother from, you know,
gettin' his eat on.

12:22.634 --> 12:25.364
I hear you're real good
with your tongue.

12:25.503 --> 12:29.906
- Real good.
- You know, I do what I gotta do
to please the ladies, right?

12:30.008 --> 12:33.102
- "Please the ladies."
- I heard you been pleasing
cops with that tongue too, bra.

12:33.244 --> 12:36.509
Yo, what? man..Hell no, God.
In ever talked to the cops, man.

12:36.614 --> 12:39.378
Come on, man.
I'm just sayin', everybody knows...

12:39.484 --> 12:42.248
- what goes around here is
strictly God's business, right?
- Right.

12:42.353 --> 12:44.981
I'm just a hard work in' brother
tryin' to survive. You know how it is.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.615
Don't play me,
mother fucker.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.957
I mean, a couple of cops
came down to Burger Castle
tryin' to scare a brother.

12:51.062 --> 12:55.123
That's all, man. Yo, God,
I ain't tell 'em shit. They was
tryin' to get me to rat you out.

12:55.266 --> 12:58.895
- 'Cause you took
the fuckin' cheese, didn't you?
- No, man, I wouldn't do that.

12:59.003 --> 13:02.666
- I got nothin' but love fory' all.
- What are you, a faggot?

13:02.807 --> 13:05.173
- I'm God. God, mother fucker!
- I didn't say nothin'.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.245
What do you mean, you wouldn't do that,
you tall skinny bastard?

13:08.346 --> 13:11.838
Tique, hold her stinky ass down.
Easy, now.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.316
Close the mother fuckin' door.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.616
What's up, girlfriend? Chillin'?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.559
Everything's fine.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.823
I ain't chicken, but
I can't deal with that cat.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.767
If I was you, I'd pick the
nigger's tongue up off the floor...

13:32.871 --> 13:34.896
and finish the job myself.

13:40.178 --> 13:42.442
I know I ain't gonna hear
nothin' about this, am I?

13:42.547 --> 13:46.142
- No. No.
- Huh?

13:46.251 --> 13:48.242
I'm gonna holler at you.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.547
Gotcha!
Where you goin' now?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.762
Come on, champ.
One more time!

13:58.863 --> 14:01.161
You ain't get him.
You gotta get T-Rex down.

14:01.266 --> 14:04.235
T-Rex justjumped up on ya.

14:07.172 --> 14:10.733
Marcus, get off
your Uncle Jeff.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.139
You got a good thing goin', bro.

14:13.211 --> 14:15.839
Yeah, well, you know,
you're such an expert, man.

14:15.947 --> 14:18.347
Time for you to start
a little family of your own.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.919
Shit. You musta been
talkin' to Mama.

14:23.021 --> 14:24.989
- No, man, I'm serious.
- What?

14:25.089 --> 14:27.216
You been on full-time
for over a year now, right?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.418
- Yeah.
- I know you got some
green socked away.

14:29.527 --> 14:33.156
- Little bit.
- Mm-hmm. Time to settle
down, man. Make you busy.

14:33.264 --> 14:35.459
All right?

14:35.567 --> 14:38.559
Yeah. Maybe after I get busy
with a couple hundred more women.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.104
Then me and you can talk.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.667
Come on.
Wanna dance with me?

14:53.384 --> 14:55.443
Turn the music down,
college girl.

14:55.553 --> 14:59.546
I been fuckin' with
Manny for months, man.
I'm tired of this shit.

14:59.657 --> 15:02.649
What's up, man? You want to
do business or what, Holmes?

15:02.760 --> 15:06.127
Let me check you out, man.
Won't take long.

15:06.231 --> 15:08.131
- What you talkin' about?
- Then you got your three ki's, yo.

15:08.266 --> 15:11.724
What is this, interrogation?
I can take my money
where it's appreciated.

15:11.836 --> 15:14.100
- You hear what I'm sayin'?
- We have procedures.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.333
- "Procedures."
- Oh, oh, oh, oh. Them
niggers from New Jersey?

15:19.711 --> 15:21.838
Forget that.
You don't want to do that.

15:21.946 --> 15:24.278
- They bad news, man.
- Oh, they bad news?

15:24.382 --> 15:27.647
- That's right. Stay here.
- Check it out. They might
be bad news for you,

15:27.752 --> 15:29.686
maybe, but for me..

15:29.787 --> 15:32.221
- You know what I mean, bro?
- Oh, it's like that. All right.

15:33.424 --> 15:36.518
You know what they
call the head one? God.

15:36.628 --> 15:39.062
- You believe that shit, man?
- Is that right?

15:43.968 --> 15:46.459
- Ese, I don't feel like it.
- Come on!

15:46.604 --> 15:49.402
Can't you see I'm talking?

15:49.507 --> 15:52.271
You wanna dance with me?

15:52.377 --> 15:55.744
Or are you as lame as my
two tired-ass brothers?

15:55.847 --> 15:57.747
Whoa!

15:57.849 --> 16:01.080
Piece of advice.
There ain't no such
thing as one dance...

16:01.185 --> 16:03.085
with Esperanza.

16:03.187 --> 16:05.712
Well?

16:07.158 --> 16:09.058
- It's cool.
- It's cool?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.526
You don't have to ask him.
Come on.

16:16.034 --> 16:18.366
Whoo! Go, college girl. Go.

16:25.176 --> 16:29.078
So, uh, what happens
to the family?

16:29.213 --> 16:32.307
- What do you mean?
- The girl.

16:32.417 --> 16:36.217
- Why are you asking me this?
- Because I would like to know.

16:36.321 --> 16:39.757
- Drop it.
- What if I don't want to drop it?

16:39.857 --> 16:42.018
Then you're messed up,
buddy.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.060
Look, look, look, guys.
Don't get me wrong.

16:44.162 --> 16:46.255
I don't give a fuck what
happens to her brothers.

16:46.364 --> 16:49.231
- I just want to make
sure that the girl's..
- The girl what?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.426
If she's as clean as she says she is,
she'll be fine.

16:51.569 --> 16:54.197
Not that it's any of your business.

16:54.339 --> 16:56.432
You guys don't get it. Her
brothers are payin' for college..

16:56.574 --> 16:59.600
Junkies are payin' for it, man..
some with their lives.

16:59.744 --> 17:03.145
If I were her little mamacita,
I'd look into some student loans.

17:03.281 --> 17:06.682
Either that, or she can work
her little ass out on the street.

17:06.784 --> 17:08.684
- Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you!

17:08.786 --> 17:10.981
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go.

17:11.089 --> 17:13.648
Shit, Captain, help this boy
find himself a cover.

17:13.758 --> 17:15.988
This battery's fucked.
Hold this.

17:16.094 --> 17:18.186
Makes sure this
shit works, man.

17:21.299 --> 17:23.267
What? I'm cool.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.665
- I hope so.
- Cool.

17:25.770 --> 17:29.797
He's right, you know. You
gotta find yourself a deeper l.D.

17:29.941 --> 17:32.068
You gotta find yourself
some street character, you know?

17:32.210 --> 17:36.374
Create one to hide behind
so your feelings don't
mess you up so much.

17:36.481 --> 17:38.381
So what are you saying?
Act more?

17:38.483 --> 17:40.917
No. Care less.

17:44.088 --> 17:46.522
Ahh!

17:46.624 --> 17:48.956
Whoo! Yeah!

17:49.060 --> 17:51.790
Yeah, look at me,
look at me.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.334
See? See, Mommy?
See? See?

17:57.468 --> 18:02.371
Any one got a vacuum cleaner
like that for a nose ain't
no cabron, Mommy. Right?

18:02.473 --> 18:05.704
I hope you're right. Cause you're
the one who bring him here.

18:05.810 --> 18:08.301
Mommy, come on.
He's cool. I promise.

18:15.953 --> 18:18.513
- You want one, Mommy?
- No.

18:18.623 --> 18:21.683
I want to count
the money.

18:21.793 --> 18:23.784
Man!

18:23.895 --> 18:26.921
Yo, Miguel, man.
Moms..

18:27.031 --> 18:31.297
Moms ain't no joke, man. Damn.
She don't trust nobody, man.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.370
- Mommy?
- Que?

18:34.472 --> 18:37.373
Sit and have a drink with us.

18:37.475 --> 18:40.103
Long as he's been
felt good for wire.

18:44.382 --> 18:47.044
Breakin' my chops.
What's up, man?

18:47.151 --> 18:49.619
Shit.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.484
- What's wrong with the reception?
- Got a wire loose.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.081
- You mean you messed up.
- Hey, he's got it on
his balls, for Christ sake.

18:55.193 --> 18:58.321
They got a mind of their own.
I mean, he snorted some coke,
he's sweating and it shorted.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.863
Hey, quiet.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.695
I'm sayin', come on with
all of that, man. Miguel.

19:03.801 --> 19:07.760
- What's up, man?
- Dude, just two seconds, man.
It ain't nothin'.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.999
- Yo, what's the problem, dude?
- It's not about that, man.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.271
You want this money or what?
Ain't nobody feelin' me up for no wire.

19:13.377 --> 19:17.404
Yo, yo, yo. You ain't gonna
be doin' business period,
you take that tone in my house.

19:17.515 --> 19:20.075
I ain't feelin' that right there.
You got this money right here.

19:20.184 --> 19:24.746
Yo, you better step the fuck off.
Don't disrespect me in my house.

19:26.424 --> 19:29.416
- Goddamn it. She grabbed his balls.
- Move in. Move in. All units.

19:29.527 --> 19:31.791
Move in now. Officer
in distress. Move it!

19:42.740 --> 19:44.799
Shoot the mother fucker!

19:51.382 --> 19:53.873
Don't fucking move!

20:01.859 --> 20:04.419
What's going on here?

20:05.696 --> 20:09.257
- Stay back. You can't go..
- Mommy! Mommy!

20:12.136 --> 20:15.503
Mommy!

20:15.606 --> 20:17.540
Thanks for nothin'.

20:55.179 --> 20:58.080
I put my life on the line
for you, Preston.

21:00.418 --> 21:03.546
The least I expect is somebody
to have my back out there, man.

21:03.654 --> 21:05.554
- All right. I'm sorry.
- What happened, man?

21:05.656 --> 21:08.716
I don't fuckin' know.
Some freak thing with the wire.

21:08.826 --> 21:12.227
Last think I heard in there,
you were fine, and then the
mother grabbed your nuts.

21:15.633 --> 21:18.500
"Grabbed"? She practically
ripped 'em off.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.969
I know, man.
Are you all right?

21:21.072 --> 21:23.802
- Believe that?
- Are you all right?

21:23.941 --> 21:25.875
- Yeah. Yeah.
- If you want some relief,
Jeff, you just tell me.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.342
No, no, no, no, no. I just
got a little pumped, that's all.

21:28.446 --> 21:30.380
- All right. You sure?
- Yeah. I'm cool.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.779
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm in the zone, baby.

21:32.883 --> 21:35.249
So you're ready
for the big score?

21:36.754 --> 21:39.484
- I got in this line of work
for the big score, man.
- Good.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.717
I'm going to make you
a very happy man.

21:41.826 --> 21:44.454
You're going after God.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.562
J. Reid.

21:51.669 --> 21:53.762
You got me out in the
cold, man. What's up?

21:53.871 --> 21:55.930
- BreezyT.
- Traffic bad in Akron?

21:56.073 --> 21:57.973
- No, it's all right. Yeah.
- You all right?

21:58.075 --> 22:00.009
- You ready to make this happen?
- Let's do this.

22:01.312 --> 22:03.746
Dwayne Gittens
is his real name.

22:03.881 --> 22:05.781
Comes all the way
from New Jersey.

22:05.883 --> 22:07.942
We haven't been able to get
any body near him,

22:08.052 --> 22:12.113
but we figure he's hooked in to
about 80% of the crack in this city.

22:12.223 --> 22:14.054
- Hold the bag, Tique.
- I got you.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.956
He's using the projects as his base.

22:17.061 --> 22:19.586
Word is, though, he's
spreading out state wide.

22:22.099 --> 22:25.728
- Tique! Hold the fuckin' bag!
- I'm holdin' it.

22:25.836 --> 22:28.964
If you let this bag move one more
time, I'm gonna break yourjaw.

22:29.073 --> 22:31.337
- Hold the bag.
- I hear you. I hear you.

22:35.613 --> 22:37.581
Fuckin' stupid!

22:38.949 --> 22:42.783
Yo, God. Man, folks is bitchin'.

no tickets for the turkey thing.

22:45.556 --> 22:49.117
I told 'em, ain't no more.
We got enough fuckin' freeloaders, man.

22:49.226 --> 22:51.592
Exactly who you call
a freeloader, Che?

22:51.696 --> 22:54.790
These mother fuckers.
They actin' like we're the
welfare office and shit,

22:54.899 --> 22:57.424

the whole world.

22:57.535 --> 23:00.868
Come here.
Come here.

23:00.971 --> 23:02.871
Any parent,
grandparent,

23:03.007 --> 23:05.840

or wandering fucking dog...

23:05.943 --> 23:09.379

Thanksgiving dinner with God

23:09.480 --> 23:11.744
- Uh, sure.
- And if I hear about
anybody gettin' left out,

23:11.849 --> 23:14.613
you won't be decorating
your tree this Christmas, all right?

23:16.921 --> 23:20.516
Stupid ass. So fuckin'
cheap. He acts like he's
spendin' his own money.

23:23.794 --> 23:25.762
God, this here's J. Reid.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.127
J. Reid, this is God.
This brother's turnin' out to be...

23:28.232 --> 23:30.496
a top customer
and a down brother.

23:30.601 --> 23:33.161
Oh, yeah? J. Reid, huh?
A down brother?

23:33.304 --> 23:35.295
- A lot of niggas say they down.
- Yeah..

23:35.439 --> 23:39.136

23:39.276 --> 23:42.268

23:42.380 --> 23:44.280
From Akron.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.816
From Akron?

23:46.917 --> 23:49.249
I didn't know they was gettin'
no money in Akron.

23:49.353 --> 23:52.618
Well, if you don't say nothin',
we keep it our little secret,
I keep makin' money, you know?

23:53.758 --> 23:55.658
Yeah.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.660
Know anything
about boxing?

23:59.330 --> 24:01.798
- A little somethin'.
- Yeah?

24:01.899 --> 24:04.424
- Get the mitts from this fag.
- Let me get with that.

24:06.137 --> 24:09.664
Get the fuckin' mitts.
Don't ever interrupt me, man.

24:11.108 --> 24:14.043
- What the fuck
did you do to your hair?
- Come on, man.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.735
Well, I say, uh,

24:45.876 --> 24:48.504

about boxing than you let on,

24:48.612 --> 24:51.046

24:52.416 --> 24:54.316
Make that happen for me.

24:54.418 --> 24:57.876
- He was throwin'.
He was throwin', man.
- I'm nice. I'm nice.

24:57.988 --> 24:59.979
You were excellent
not to put down them mitts, man.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.558
Yeah, maybe me and him
can go a couple of rounds, you know?

25:02.660 --> 25:04.628
Right now, I'm trying
to make this deal.

25:04.728 --> 25:07.788
We'll see about a deal,
but God ain't gonna deal direct
until he check you out fully.

25:07.898 --> 25:09.798
Life's a breeze.
You know what I'm sayin'?

25:09.900 --> 25:12.300
- Life's a breeze?
- Life's a breeze.

25:28.419 --> 25:30.478
Looking good.
What's going on?

25:30.588 --> 25:33.751
- Same old same old.
- Mm-hmm.

25:33.858 --> 25:36.793
But you know, I wanted to talk
to you, you know, for real.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.794

25:38.896 --> 25:42.332
You know, so housing is
really gettin' in my shit,
you know what I'm sayin'?

25:42.433 --> 25:46.392
And-And I can't play the
damn welfare no more,

25:46.537 --> 25:49.097
You ain't got to tell me
that shit. I was raised on it.
You know what I mean?

25:49.240 --> 25:52.801
And-And-And, you know,
I don't know what else to do,

25:52.943 --> 25:55.537
So I want to talk to you

We gonna set up shop in your
apartment, you know, make it
a little part-time office.

26:13.464 --> 26:16.592
It's gonna be strictly business.
I'm gonna take care of your rent.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.294
I'm gonna take care of everything.
And if you get a little itch,

26:19.436 --> 26:21.631
I'll scratch it for you,

26:21.772 --> 26:24.707
- I don't do that no more.
I told you that.
- I'm proud of you.

26:24.842 --> 26:27.003
I'm proud of you, all right?
Real proud of you.

26:27.144 --> 26:31.672
So look. I'm gonna send
Breeze and Che around Monday,

26:31.782 --> 26:34.649
We're gonna put a

We're gonna take care of you.

26:34.752 --> 26:37.619
All right? You're gonna
be straight. All right?

26:37.721 --> 26:40.622
Meantime, you go over there, get
you some of that sweet potato pie.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.783
- It's bangin'.
Miss Johnson made it.
- All right.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.453
- All right?
- I appreciate this, God.

26:45.563 --> 26:47.929
God is with you.
All right.

26:50.534 --> 26:53.799
Hey, little man. Enjoy yourself.
Eat somethin', all right?

26:58.108 --> 27:01.271
Whoo! Nisey be

27:01.378 --> 27:03.278
- Nisey who?
- Nisey, right there.

27:03.380 --> 27:06.008
The girl who just smiled
at you with her pussy.

27:06.116 --> 27:08.584
- You better go get some of that. Huh?
- Yeah, maybe.

27:08.686 --> 27:12.417
"Maybe"? Fuck the maybe.
You better get some of
that pie while it's hot.

27:12.523 --> 27:14.957
- What's up, God?
- What's up, dude?

27:15.059 --> 27:17.960
J. here didn't have no
place to go for, uh,

27:18.062 --> 27:20.929
this day of Thanksgiving, so
I brought him with, you know?

27:21.031 --> 27:23.591
Want him to see what sort of
organization he's dealing with.

27:23.701 --> 27:26.534
What you see?

27:26.637 --> 27:28.935
Look to me like
y'all havin' a ball, man.

27:29.039 --> 27:31.007
Ballin', baby. We doin' our
thing, you know what I mean?

27:31.108 --> 27:33.440
- Feed the people.
- I'm with that. I'm with that.

27:33.544 --> 27:35.637
I got this little thing
of my own back home, you know?

27:35.746 --> 27:39.011
- That's good. Yo, Pam! Frisco!
- What's up?

27:40.517 --> 27:43.884
Pam, come here, man.
Yo, Pam!

27:43.988 --> 27:46.684
- I'm comin', baby. I'm comin'.
- Come here.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.690
I'm comin'.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.760
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

27:50.861 --> 27:52.852
- How my baby doin'?
- Kickin' like a bitch.

27:52.963 --> 27:56.626
Don't be callin' my baby
no bitch. That's gonna be
God's little princess.

27:56.734 --> 27:59.134
- Give me a fuckin' break, Dwayne.
- Run your mouth, huh?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.531
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- That's my seed, man.
You know what I mean?

28:04.675 --> 28:06.768
That don't mean nothin'
without what I got.

28:08.345 --> 28:11.178
- Yo, what's your name, nigger?
- J. Reid, man.

28:11.281 --> 28:13.112
Smart-mouth here's
Pam, my wife.

28:13.283 --> 28:15.751
This is Frisco.

28:15.853 --> 28:18.287
- That's my man. We grew up
together in Newark.
- Peace.

28:20.057 --> 28:22.753
Word up. He's gonna be
my baby's godfather.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.795
- No, no, no, no, no.
Our baby's godfather.
- Our baby's godfather.

28:25.896 --> 28:28.490
- Don't start no trouble, man.
- Shut up, nigger.

28:28.599 --> 28:30.658
Yo, you better watch out
for this nigger here.
He stronger than he look.

28:30.768 --> 28:33.601
Oh, yeah? So you like
shootin' joints, kid?

28:33.704 --> 28:35.729
A little somethin', you know?

28:35.873 --> 28:39.331
- Yo, yo. You holdin'?
- I'm holdin', baby.
I'm holdin' it all.

28:39.476 --> 28:41.774
- All right.
I'm feelin' that.
- What you need?

28:41.879 --> 28:43.779
Hey, man. Whatever, man.
You know?

28:43.881 --> 28:45.815
Rock, AK, shoddy-body,
whatever.

28:45.916 --> 28:48.510
Yo, lines, trees,
long-nose, what?

28:48.619 --> 28:51.247
- Got a necklace
that shines and shit.
- Uh-huh.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.188
Hold it, now.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.691
Get up on it! Hurry up, man!

28:58.028 --> 29:00.428
- Do it!
- Get that nigger!
You got him, man!

29:00.531 --> 29:02.431
Damn.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.627
Give me the uwap!
What's wrong with you?

29:05.736 --> 29:10.036
- Come on!
- What's wrong with y' all? I had him.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.836
I'm a little disgusted with you.
I thought you could shoot.

29:12.976 --> 29:15.638
Why you not give me the uwap?
I had the cat right there.

29:15.746 --> 29:18.180
- Come on!
- Turn this shit around!

29:18.282 --> 29:21.080
All that shootin',
and you ain't hit nothin'.

29:21.185 --> 29:23.085
- What's up, G?
- What's up, baby?

29:23.187 --> 29:25.018
Chillin'.

29:25.122 --> 29:28.023
Did your man J. Reid
murder these mother fuckers or what?

29:28.125 --> 29:30.525
- He's crazy.
- That nigger..
He didn't murder nothin'.

29:30.627 --> 29:32.527
- What do you mean?
- He can't shoot.

29:32.629 --> 29:35.530
He emptied out the whole
joint and asked for the Uzi.

29:35.632 --> 29:38.032
I'm, like, with
that whack-ass aim..

29:38.135 --> 29:40.035
So how you know
he ain't frontin'?

29:40.137 --> 29:44.039
Listen, the way he was shootin' up
and all that, he's on point.

29:44.141 --> 29:46.575
- I would vouch for that, for real.
- You'd vouch for that?

29:46.677 --> 29:48.577
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:48.679 --> 29:51.580
So this is what you gon' do..
you put on with them new
kids. What's their names?

29:51.682 --> 29:53.582
- Ozzie and Gash.
- Ozzie and Gash.

29:53.684 --> 29:56.585
Whatever the fuck his name is,
you put him with them, let him do that.

29:56.687 --> 29:59.713
- If that pans out, let 'em pray to God.
- Send it through.

30:04.394 --> 30:06.624
So, you comin' back
tonight, baby?

30:06.730 --> 30:09.631
What, you don't
get enough or somethin'?

30:09.733 --> 30:12.634
Well, when you get it,
and it's good,

30:12.736 --> 30:14.636
you wanna keep gettin' it.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.706
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.104
So, what's up?
You got a woman in Akron?

30:22.846 --> 30:26.441
For your information, no, l
don't have a woman. All right?

30:26.550 --> 30:28.450
In Akron
or anywhere else.

30:28.552 --> 30:30.611
That's what I want to hear.

30:32.723 --> 30:35.624
- Why I gotta go through
this with you every time?
- What about mean you?

30:35.726 --> 30:38.627
- I told you I gotta do somethin'!
- Huh?

30:38.729 --> 30:42.790
- It's always Gash!
- Every day it's the same
thing with you, man!

30:42.900 --> 30:44.424
- Hey, Nisey.
- What's up, girl?

30:44.535 --> 30:46.628
Come here, man! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

30:46.737 --> 30:50.605
- You don't fuckin' listen, man!
- Shit.

30:56.613 --> 30:59.946
- Damn.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

31:00.050 --> 31:03.042
You stupid mother fucker!

31:03.153 --> 31:06.554
Come on, get up, man.
I ain't even kicked you
that fuckin' hard.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.225
- Aw, look at you.
- No, man.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.227
Fall on the ground.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.160
You all right, man?

31:14.264 --> 31:17.961
What you askin' for?
You just kicked her in her butt.

31:18.068 --> 31:19.968
Bastard.

31:20.070 --> 31:21.970
- Later.
- Get on out of here.

31:22.072 --> 31:23.972
What's up with you, dog?

31:24.107 --> 31:27.941
- You can't be smackin'
on your girl like that.
- I ain't slap her.

31:28.045 --> 31:31.446
I'm sayin' let's go do this.
You got me out here waitin'.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.948
- Yo.
- You was waitin' for
two minutes, man.

31:34.051 --> 31:37.384
Don't worry about it.
God wants us to hook you up,
we goin' hook you up.

31:44.995 --> 31:47.896
Y'all niggers better be
comin' on with some uncut...

31:47.998 --> 31:51.490
to bring me all the way
out to Newport, man.

31:51.602 --> 31:53.536
We'll set you up real nice.

31:53.637 --> 31:55.969
You know we got
the good stuff.

31:56.073 --> 31:59.008
I thought y'all worked
out of Horton Park.

31:59.109 --> 32:02.044
I thought you was
from fuckin' Akron.

32:02.179 --> 32:05.410
-Akron.
- What the hell you know
about where God do business?

32:06.884 --> 32:08.784
Just sit tight, dog.

32:08.886 --> 32:12.447
We be there in, like,
less than five minutes.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.719
Hey, yo, what the fucky' all
used to do out in Akron anyway?

32:15.826 --> 32:18.192
Y'all used to
deal corn and shit?

32:32.943 --> 32:35.844
- Where the hell we goin', man?
- Downstairs, nigger.

32:35.946 --> 32:38.847
Gonna take care
of this bitch.

32:38.949 --> 32:40.849
I like them chains, dog.

32:40.951 --> 32:43.943
Gonna get me some chains
just like that.

32:44.054 --> 32:45.954
What's up?
They payin' y'all too?

32:46.056 --> 32:48.957
No. They say we gotta
prove ourselves first.

32:49.059 --> 32:51.459
That's just what we gonna do..
prove ourselves.

32:51.561 --> 32:54.962
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
We want all the money, man,
and them chains you got on.

32:55.065 --> 32:56.965
This how God
do business?

32:57.067 --> 32:59.831
No, this how Ozzie and Gash do
business. Where the money at, man?

32:59.937 --> 33:02.462
Fuck that, Oz!
Do this thing!

33:02.606 --> 33:04.540
Oz, come on, man!

33:47.617 --> 33:49.517
Jesus Christ.

33:49.619 --> 33:52.520
- Hello?
- Some crazy shit
just happened, man.

33:52.622 --> 33:55.352
These mother fuckers
tried to kill me.

33:55.459 --> 33:58.360
- Jeff?
- Wake the fuck up, Preston!

33:58.462 --> 34:01.863
- These two cats
tried to take me out, man!
- Are you all right?

34:01.965 --> 34:04.866
They just tried to fuckin'
kill me. Oh, shit.

34:04.968 --> 34:08.233
- Did anybody see you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.237
- Did anybody see you?
- No.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.239
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.139
Okay. I'm pullin' you out.

34:14.277 --> 34:16.177
- What?
- I'm pullin' you out.

34:17.947 --> 34:20.849
- What are you talkin' about?
I can't do that.
- I'm doin' it.

34:20.951 --> 34:23.851
I'm gonna call Wilson.
Meet me at the spot in 45 minutes.

34:23.954 --> 34:27.411
- Are you crazy, man?
We're gonna blow the whole thing.
- This is not a suggestion, Jeff.

34:27.524 --> 34:31.221
This is an order. You
do what I tell you to do.

34:31.328 --> 34:33.989
Hello? Hello?

34:41.605 --> 34:43.505
Yeah, yeah.
Who the fuck is it?

34:43.607 --> 34:46.507
It's J. Reid, man.
I need to talk to you.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.804
Chill out. You
gon' wake my daughter.

34:49.946 --> 34:52.847
- I wanna talk to you.
- Hey, man, what's up? What's up?

34:52.949 --> 34:55.850
- "What's up"? I'm still alive.
That's what's up, nigga.
- What the fuck..

34:55.952 --> 34:58.853
- Put the gun down, baby.
- Couple of your boys
just tried to kill me.

34:58.955 --> 35:00.855
- What?
- You tryin' to play me?

35:00.957 --> 35:03.858
I ain't tryin' to play you.
All right?

35:03.960 --> 35:05.860
Hey, hey, listen.

35:05.962 --> 35:08.863
Ain't the way we do business.
You know that, J.

35:08.999 --> 35:12.435
- You oughta know who you
got workin' for you, dog.
- I know who l got workin' for me.

35:12.502 --> 35:16.632
Maybe they was gonna
try to impress God with
some bullshit. Right?

35:16.773 --> 35:20.334
They new to the fam, J.
That's it. My word.

35:20.444 --> 35:24.778
My word. You tell me where they at,
we'll do 'em right now.

35:24.881 --> 35:28.612
Last time I saw Ozzie,
he was bleedin' like a little bitch.

35:28.718 --> 35:31.619
Gash scream
when I shot his dick off.

35:31.721 --> 35:34.622
That's what they get
for fuckin' with an O.G.
ike you, right, nigger?

35:34.724 --> 35:37.625
Let me make a call.
I'll get you the blow
tonight if you need it.

35:37.761 --> 35:40.161
- No. No.
I'm not tryin' to..
- We'll make it square.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.164
- I'm gon' take my money
where it's appreciated.
- We appreciate it.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.133
- We'll make this deal square.
- You tryin' to play me, man.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.136
Come on, baby. We can
still make this square.
Why it gotta be that?

35:49.272 --> 35:51.968
Why it gotta be
like this sh..

36:28.245 --> 36:30.645
Shit.

36:35.886 --> 36:37.820
Damn, Pres.

36:37.921 --> 36:41.948
In the dark, layin' in the cut..
You gon' get yourself shot.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.396
I expect my officers
to obey a direct order.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.399
What I don't expect is having
to go to their apartments...

36:51.501 --> 36:53.435
to fucking say so.

36:53.570 --> 36:57.507
Let me tell you somethin'
about your direct order..
it could've got me killed out there!

36:57.507 --> 37:01.170
I'm the one in there!
I'm the one doin' it!
It's gonna be my call!

37:01.311 --> 37:04.212
It's gonna be my call whether
you stay on this case or not.

37:04.314 --> 37:07.340
I got seven other officers, seven
other, working undercover.. good ones..

37:07.417 --> 37:10.318
and none of them
fuck with me but you.

37:10.453 --> 37:14.787
Yeah, none of 'em can do
what I can do either, Pres,
and don't you forget that.

37:14.891 --> 37:18.292
Why are you in such a hurry
to end up in a box?

37:18.395 --> 37:22.456
That's exactly where I would be
if I didn't show 'em J. Reid
could handle himself!.

37:22.566 --> 37:25.899
You ain't out there, man.
You don't understand what's goin' on.

37:26.002 --> 37:27.902
Well, maybe
you'll understand this:

37:28.004 --> 37:31.565
You're out of the God business.
You're off the case.
Hand me your gun and badge.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.609
- What?
- I said give me your gun and badge.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.804
You're off the case.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.720
Are you serious?

37:45.822 --> 37:47.722
Let's go.

37:52.195 --> 37:55.096
I'll find you a
safe place to stay.

37:55.198 --> 37:58.656
- God and his boys'll think
you went back to Akron.
- Whatever.

38:00.770 --> 38:04.035
Sorry, kid.
You disobeyed a director oder.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.040
This is the way it works.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.631
Somebody used the place
as a drug lab...

38:29.733 --> 38:31.826
until the D.E.A.
busted them a year ago.

38:31.935 --> 38:35.962
They haven't gotten around
to auctioning it off yet,
so stay as long as you need.

38:36.072 --> 38:39.235
Listen, the only hobby you
ever mentioned is photography,

38:39.342 --> 38:42.243
so I made arrangements
at a college nearby...

38:42.345 --> 38:43.993
if you want to
take some courses.

38:44.709 --> 38:48.378
Every cop who's been
undercover as long as you
have needs a break, Jeff.

38:48.485 --> 38:51.386
Just think of it
as rural R&R.

39:04.267 --> 39:07.634
Well, somebody was
supposed to come out here
and clean this place up,

39:07.737 --> 39:09.671
but obviously they didn't.

39:09.773 --> 39:14.107
I can at least guarantee you
you will not run into anybody
who knows J. Reid around here. So..

39:14.210 --> 39:16.110
All right.

39:17.747 --> 39:20.045
Oh, yeah. Well..

39:20.150 --> 39:23.051
A little dusting,
you know, you'll..

39:23.153 --> 39:24.984
You'll be all right.

39:25.088 --> 39:29.787
Preston, it's like
a tomb in here, man.

39:29.893 --> 39:32.726
I-I'm a city boy.
I can't do this. Come on.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.729
What do you want me
to tell you?

39:34.831 --> 39:37.732
You can stay here
and get your shit together,

39:37.834 --> 39:40.735
or you can quit the force
and lead an ordinary life.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.737
Those are your choices,
so..

39:42.839 --> 39:44.773
Thanks.

39:44.874 --> 39:47.274
Look, I never been too good
at ordinary.

39:47.377 --> 39:49.436
I know.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.689
Something bothering you,
Mr. Cole?

40:40.797 --> 40:45.234
Yeah, actually, I'd like to move
that light hitting her face.

40:59.849 --> 41:03.649
Could you hurry up?
I have to pee.

41:06.055 --> 41:07.955
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hi.

41:08.057 --> 41:09.957
I'm, uh..
I'm Jeff.

41:10.059 --> 41:11.959
Myra.

41:12.061 --> 41:14.894
Um, I was just wonderin'
if, uh..

41:14.998 --> 41:17.899
- I don't drink coffee.
- Excuse me?

41:18.001 --> 41:21.903
I don't drink coffee,
and I don't date the men
at my nude class.

41:22.005 --> 41:24.064
Okay.

41:24.174 --> 41:26.039
It's cool, you know.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.178
You're a dancer, huh?

41:30.280 --> 41:32.441
- What?
- You dance, right?

41:32.549 --> 41:34.449
How did you know that?

41:34.551 --> 41:37.452
'Cause you have posture
like a dancer, you know.

41:37.554 --> 41:39.454
Back upright,
shoulders down.

41:40.690 --> 41:43.591
Yes, actually, I, um..
I am a dancer.

41:43.693 --> 41:47.925
But we're on hiatus right now,
so I teach ballet part-time
and I also model.

41:48.031 --> 41:50.124
That's cool.
That's cool.

41:50.266 --> 41:53.133
Well, see, actually,
I was just wonderin',

41:53.269 --> 41:57.228
'cause I'm finishing up my
portfolio and I need a model.

41:57.373 --> 42:02.538
So I was wonderin' if maybe
I could hire you to pose.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.545
Strictly professional.

42:04.681 --> 42:06.842
"Strictly professional."

42:06.916 --> 42:09.817
- You can keep your clothes on.
- Oh, thanks.

42:12.255 --> 42:14.086
Oh, you're so cute!

42:14.190 --> 42:16.124
Oh!

42:16.226 --> 42:21.129
You didn't tell me you had a puppy.
My God, he's adorable.

42:21.231 --> 42:24.166
Miles is not quite a
puppy. He's a wolf.

42:24.300 --> 42:26.200
You're kidding me, right?

42:26.302 --> 42:28.395
Nuh-uh.

42:35.612 --> 42:37.842
So, what made you
name him Miles?

42:37.947 --> 42:39.847
After the man himself.

42:39.949 --> 42:41.849
Miles Davis.

42:41.951 --> 42:44.044
What you know about Miles?

42:46.523 --> 42:48.423
I like Miles.

42:50.827 --> 42:53.227
Actually, I love Miles.

42:53.329 --> 42:55.388
Move over here
for a second.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.801
Why don't you just
let me do my thing?

43:01.271 --> 43:04.138
Excuse me, mama.
Go ahead, do your thing.

43:06.276 --> 43:08.176
Just do it. Okay?

43:10.446 --> 43:12.346
So?

43:12.448 --> 43:14.348
So what?

43:14.450 --> 43:16.350
So, what do you do?

43:18.454 --> 43:20.854
- I'm an actor.
- Yeah, right.

43:20.957 --> 43:23.858
Why?
What do you think I do?

43:25.562 --> 43:28.963
I think you're puttin 'me on,
is what I think.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.965
Okay, okay.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.306
I'm a cop.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.976
Really?

43:46.082 --> 43:47.982
Really.

43:49.953 --> 43:51.853
Really nice.

43:55.725 --> 43:57.625
Very nice.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.329
I mean the girl.

44:04.567 --> 44:08.765
I-I..
I think she's beautiful.

44:08.871 --> 44:12.807
So, seems like you two are
gettin' along pretty well.

44:12.909 --> 44:15.844
Are you askin' me if
we're sleeping together?

44:15.979 --> 44:18.880
No, no. I was just
making an observation.

44:18.982 --> 44:21.382
Easy.

44:21.484 --> 44:24.112
This one's special, Pres.

44:24.220 --> 44:26.051
Watch yourself.

44:26.155 --> 44:28.453
I'm glad you're doing
so well ,Jeff.

44:28.558 --> 44:32.790
Personally, I think I'm doin'
well enough to go back in.

44:32.895 --> 44:35.455
- We'll see.
- What do you mean, "we'll see"?

44:36.566 --> 44:38.295
I mean,
we'll see.

44:38.434 --> 44:42.904
I'm just thinking, what would my
mom think if I brought you home?

44:43.807 --> 44:45.704
What would she think?
What do you think?

44:46.229 --> 44:49.130
I think she would think
you're pretty cute.

45:00.759 --> 45:02.659
What about my moms?

45:02.761 --> 45:06.197
I don't think my moms' take
too kindly to me datin' a dancer...

45:06.298 --> 45:08.391
and a part-time
nude model.

45:12.571 --> 45:15.404
Nah, I dig it.
I dig it.

45:15.507 --> 45:17.702
- I think my moms would love you.
- You do?

45:35.406 --> 45:36.559
What a sexy!

45:37.508 --> 45:38.704
Right there. Right there.

45:39.962 --> 45:41.486
- Oh!
- Beat me up.

45:41.630 --> 45:43.530
Sorry.
Did I get your eye?

45:46.001 --> 45:49.835
Ooh, honey, I'm hungry.
Could you go get me a hot dog?

45:49.972 --> 45:52.031
Please?
Please, please, please?

45:52.174 --> 45:54.734
- I got your hot dog right here.
- Oooh!

45:54.910 --> 45:57.435
Hold this. I'll be back.

46:05.187 --> 46:07.087
See that?

46:07.189 --> 46:09.089
Yeah!

46:09.191 --> 46:11.455
- You're Dan Connelly.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

46:12.595 --> 46:14.426
- Guilty.
- How you doin'?

46:14.530 --> 46:17.431
I'm...Jeff Cole, Officer.

46:17.533 --> 46:20.468
I was workin' with
Preston D'Ambrosio in Cincinnati.

46:20.569 --> 46:23.470
We first met when you were assigned
to the Dwayne Gittens case.

46:23.572 --> 46:26.439
- Oh, right. I remember.
- Hey, Daddy, I wanna
see the seagulls.

46:26.509 --> 46:28.409
- Okay, sweetie.
- You wanna see them too?

46:28.511 --> 46:30.741
- Go with Mommy.
- Bye-bye.

46:30.846 --> 46:33.246
We'll be up on the deck, Dan.

46:33.349 --> 46:35.544
I'll be right there, honey.
Hold Mommy's hand.

46:37.119 --> 46:40.020
Uh, yeah, you were involved
in the Batista case, right?

46:40.122 --> 46:42.056
- Great memory.
- You did some good work.

46:42.158 --> 46:44.183
Thank you.

46:44.293 --> 46:47.353
Something happened on the Gittens case,
they had to pull you, right?

46:47.463 --> 46:52.696
I was just wonderin' if you
got anybody undercover now..
State, D.E.A., anybody.

46:52.802 --> 46:57.364
We keep tryin' to get in deep
enough to get his main
supplier, but no one lasts.

46:57.506 --> 47:00.634
Either they get made, or it seems
too risky and they want out.

47:00.743 --> 47:03.644
Mmm.
So what's your plan?

47:03.746 --> 47:08.080
We pull Gittens off the streets
on tax evasion charges,
hope we can make it stick.

47:08.184 --> 47:11.085
Look, he'll plea-bargain after
two, three years tops, easy.

47:11.187 --> 47:14.520
Well, at the moment
I don't have an alternative.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.017
Put me back in.

47:18.127 --> 47:21.028
I promise you, I'll get you
somethin' to crucify the bastard.

47:21.130 --> 47:24.463
- How can you be sure?
- Nobody can get in as deep as me.

47:25.868 --> 47:29.304
If you want God and his
angels down for good,

47:29.405 --> 47:31.305
put me in.

47:34.710 --> 47:37.611
What's happenin', Pres?
We meetin' early this week or what?

47:37.713 --> 47:39.613
You know goddamn well
what's happenin'.

47:39.715 --> 47:42.343
I got called into
State Attorney Connelly's
office this morning.

47:42.451 --> 47:44.248
Did you know that?

47:44.353 --> 47:47.720
- So, did you tell him I'm out of
my fuckin' mind or somethin'?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

47:47.823 --> 47:52.157
- I talked to the chief
about getting you fired.
- So why am I not fired?

47:52.261 --> 47:55.662
Because Rick Scott of the
D.E.A. and Connelly got to
the chief before I did.

47:55.764 --> 47:59.700
Somehow they're all convinced
that you can single-handedly
bring down Dwayne Gittens.

47:59.802 --> 48:03.169
- I can.
- No, you can't. Not
by yourself, you can't.

48:03.305 --> 48:06.706
Look, the longer it
takes me to get back in,
the harder it's gonna be.

48:06.809 --> 48:10.301
You know that.
Just trust me on this, man.

48:51.587 --> 48:53.487
What's up?

48:59.829 --> 49:01.353
They want you to go
back in, don't they?

49:15.077 --> 49:17.910
So were you gonna
tell me, or.. or what?

49:18.014 --> 49:20.608
Was I just supposed
to figure it out?

49:20.716 --> 49:24.777
Look, I've been straight
with you from the beginning,
all right, Myra?

49:24.887 --> 49:28.288
And that's it? That's it?
Just like that? That's it?

49:28.391 --> 49:31.383
What are you talkin' about?
I'm gonna be back.

49:31.494 --> 49:34.019
It's not even that big of a
deal, man. It's just my thing.

49:34.130 --> 49:38.362
Everybody has their thing.
Like, you wanted to be a dancer
since you were little girl, right?

49:38.467 --> 49:41.436
Yeah, but not every
little boy growing up
in the projects...

49:41.537 --> 49:43.664
wants to be an
undercover cop, okay?

49:47.209 --> 49:49.837
Baby, you don't understand.
When I was growin' up in the projects,

49:49.946 --> 49:54.280
there was this huge gray wall
that surrounded the whole thing.

49:54.383 --> 49:57.318
I never figured out if the city
put it up to keep the residents in...

49:57.420 --> 49:58.717
or to keep the scum out.

49:59.889 --> 50:02.585
But, you know, they decided
that the wall needed decoratin',

50:02.692 --> 50:08.289
so they got all the
graffiti artists together,
and they covered the wall.

50:08.397 --> 50:10.695
They covered it with
the names and the ages,

50:10.833 --> 50:15.237
sometimes the faces,
of every kid that got killed
in the neighborhood.

50:15.338 --> 50:18.865
I had to pass that
wall, you know,

50:19.008 --> 50:21.169
Leavin' home
or comin' in.

50:21.277 --> 50:23.541
Every day.

50:23.646 --> 50:26.308
It was like one day
I was comin' home,

50:26.415 --> 50:30.010
passed the wall,
and itjust, like, hit me.

50:30.119 --> 50:33.714
I just realized that
without even trying,

50:33.823 --> 50:37.190
I memorized all the names
on the wall.

50:40.196 --> 50:44.064
The youngest kid,
his name was Daryl.

50:44.166 --> 50:47.192
Daryl Rolley.

50:47.303 --> 50:49.430
He was only three years old.

50:53.976 --> 50:58.743
That's when I decided that
I wanted to do somethin'.

51:01.083 --> 51:04.849
I-I wanted to
make things change.

51:17.085 --> 51:19.747
Hey, come on, man.
We gotta hustle, all right?

51:19.888 --> 51:22.686
I told God you were in Akron.
He thought it was real smart...

51:22.791 --> 51:25.453
for you to disappear
till things chilled out.

51:28.830 --> 51:31.060
Hey, yo. What's up?

51:31.166 --> 51:33.566
- What up, Breezy?
- Word. What up?

51:42.744 --> 51:46.111
Do you, Sidney and Martha,
swear before God...

51:46.214 --> 51:48.739
that you will protect
Anwar Sidney Gittens...

51:48.850 --> 51:51.546
from any misfortune that
may befall his parents?

51:51.653 --> 51:53.621
- Yes, indeed.
- Yes.

51:53.722 --> 51:56.850
Will the members of the immediate
family please come forward?

52:02.163 --> 52:04.063
That's a beautiful boy,
ain't it?

52:05.700 --> 52:08.533
He's feeling a little better?
All right.

52:08.637 --> 52:10.628
How you doin'?
Thanks for comin'.

52:14.876 --> 52:17.970
- Peace.
- You okay, Nisey?

52:24.319 --> 52:27.152
Take him to the car.

52:38.333 --> 52:40.233
Okay.
Come on, you.

52:40.335 --> 52:42.860
- What's up, J.? What's goin' on?
- What's up, baby?

52:42.971 --> 52:46.065
- How you been, man? You all right?
- What's up?

52:46.174 --> 52:49.701
- Got a little something for you.
- All right, cool.

52:49.811 --> 52:52.405
Did you see the ceremony?

52:52.514 --> 52:55.347
- Oh, no doubt, man.
Yo, congratulations, man.
- Thanks, man.

52:55.450 --> 53:00.046
He may sound soft, man, but
he's gonna be somethin' one day.

53:00.155 --> 53:03.591
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, definitely.

53:03.692 --> 53:05.592
- Yo, Frisco?
- Yeah.

53:05.727 --> 53:08.992
I'm gonna hold you
to them words, brother.

53:09.097 --> 53:11.361
That's my word
from the heart.

53:11.466 --> 53:14.594
I'll tell you somethin'.
I'm with you all the way, man.
I love the baby boy.

53:14.703 --> 53:18.400
Ain't nothin' gonna happen
to that baby that don't
happen to me first.

53:18.506 --> 53:21.839
- I love you.
- Love you too, man.
Love you more.

53:25.914 --> 53:28.712
What's going on, baby?
Where you been at, dog?

53:28.817 --> 53:32.048
Well, got a little..
got a little hectic back home.

53:32.153 --> 53:34.053
- You know?
- Word.

53:34.189 --> 53:36.680
Yo, God, J. wants
to do a little business.

53:36.825 --> 53:40.420
- Maybe later, huh?
- What ever you need,
you know I got it.

53:40.562 --> 53:44.362
- No doubt, you got it.
Everything, everything, baby.
- Yeah.

53:44.466 --> 53:47.958
- Lookin' good, man.
- Feelin' good, man.
It's been a good year, baby.

53:48.069 --> 53:50.094
That's good, man.
That's good.

53:50.205 --> 53:52.833
- Yo, um..
- What's up, man?

53:52.941 --> 53:55.603
That thing that happened
over at the building?

53:55.710 --> 53:58.577
No, no, no, no. The kid that went
to the hospital? Yeah.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.205
He met with a little accident.
You dig what I'm sayin'?

54:01.316 --> 54:03.614
Finito, all right?

54:03.718 --> 54:06.653
He wasn't no good
without his dick no way.

54:06.755 --> 54:09.656
- My gift to you, huh? My man.
- All right.

54:09.758 --> 54:12.318
It's good to see you, kid. You
look good. As clean as a chitlin.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.394
- Look at you. All right?
- I'll see you at the joint.

54:14.529 --> 54:16.429
- All right, baby.
- I'll let you know, man.

54:16.531 --> 54:18.431
- All right. Definitely
want to see you later.
- Stay out of trouble, baby.

54:18.533 --> 54:20.433
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, yeah.

54:25.039 --> 54:27.473
- What's up?
Yo, get my mans in, man.
- What's up?

54:27.575 --> 54:29.941
- All right, my brother.
- Get 'em up here.
How are you, dog?

54:30.044 --> 54:31.944
- All right.
- God in there?

54:32.046 --> 54:33.946
Yeah, yeah.

54:37.085 --> 54:40.248
- What's up?
- What's up, baby? You smell good.

54:40.355 --> 54:44.189
- Have you seen God? What's up, bro?
- I haven't seen him all night.

54:57.205 --> 55:01.141
- Hi, J.
- What's up? How you doin',
baby? Lookin' good.

55:01.242 --> 55:04.678
- What's up, dog?
- How you doin'?

55:04.779 --> 55:08.340
What's up, dude? Oh, come on, dog.
I'm gonna get you that.

55:16.457 --> 55:20.359
Yo, J.
Yo, J.

55:20.495 --> 55:22.690
- Big Mel.
- What's up, dog?

55:22.831 --> 55:25.061
- How are you, baby?
- Chillin'. I'm chillin'.

55:25.166 --> 55:27.657
You know what I'm say in'?
I'm just checkin' out the scenery.

55:27.802 --> 55:29.827
- What's up?
- Lookin' fresh, you know.
Look at these jewels.

55:29.938 --> 55:31.838
You know how I do.
You know how I do.

55:31.940 --> 55:34.636
Yeah, but check this shit
out I got in my pockets.

55:34.742 --> 55:36.903
- All new gold.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- Come on, man.

55:37.011 --> 55:40.344
- I got it.. Hold on. Check it out.
- You seen God?

55:40.448 --> 55:43.679
- Later for all that, man.
What? What, man?
- Come on, dog.

55:43.818 --> 55:45.752
It's cool. You know what I'm
sayin'? Everything's cool.

55:45.854 --> 55:48.516
I got the smoke. You
know what I'm sayin'? We
can go chief one real quick.

55:48.623 --> 55:51.091
- Whatever. Let's go.
- Come on, dog.

55:53.494 --> 55:56.429
Need a nickel bump,
nickel bump, yeah, yeah.

55:56.531 --> 55:58.931
- Yo, Che, hold up. Che, Che.
- What's up?

55:59.033 --> 56:02.491
- Is that J. over there?
- Yeah, that's J.

56:02.604 --> 56:04.834
He's goin' out back
with grimy-ass Melvin.

56:04.939 --> 56:08.431
- What would Melvin want with J.? Huh?
- I don't know.

56:08.543 --> 56:11.671
- He's up to somethin'.
- Yeah, he's definitely
up to somethin'.

56:11.779 --> 56:13.679
Wait, wait, wait.
Who did you say the other guy was?

56:13.781 --> 56:17.911
- The other guy?
- Excuse us, lady.
We got to have a drink.

56:18.019 --> 56:19.953
Wait.

56:25.927 --> 56:28.225
- What's up, man?
You gonna smoke it all up?
- No, man.

56:28.329 --> 56:32.095
- This is the good shit, baby.
That's the good shit.
- What's up with it?

56:32.200 --> 56:34.725
"It's good shit."
Shit done went out, dog.

56:34.836 --> 56:37.270
- Light it up. You got it?
- Can't get no wind.

56:37.372 --> 56:40.000
Oh, shit!

56:40.108 --> 56:43.407
Yeah. Remember that new gold
I was talkin' about in my pocket?

56:43.511 --> 56:45.376
It's your shit, bitch.

56:46.681 --> 56:48.581
Yo! What the..

56:53.021 --> 56:56.149
Yo, bring him up!
Bring him up! Come on!

56:56.291 --> 56:59.658
You ain't done!
You ain't.. That's right!

57:01.896 --> 57:04.023
You don't fuck
with this family, bitch!

57:09.304 --> 57:12.034
- You all right, J.?
- Yeah.

57:12.140 --> 57:14.233
- Your boys always got your back.
- Yeah, baby.

57:14.342 --> 57:17.209
Yeah. Always, baby.

57:17.312 --> 57:19.337
- Fuck 'im.
- Yeah, Melvin.

57:19.447 --> 57:22.348
- Get your punk ass up, boy.
- Yeah, Melvin! Come on!

57:24.385 --> 57:27.582
- You sure you don't
want to shoot this man?
- Take that shit!

57:38.866 --> 57:40.766
Yo. Yo.

57:40.868 --> 57:42.768
- J.
- What's up, man?

57:42.870 --> 57:44.770
God wants to see you, man.

57:44.872 --> 57:46.897
All right, I'll come by
tomorrow or somethin'.

57:47.008 --> 57:50.102
- No, he wants
to see you today.
- I can't do it today.

57:50.211 --> 57:53.703
- I got something to do.
- He will be waiting for you
in the club at 4:00, all right?

57:53.815 --> 57:56.477
Come on, man.

58:08.763 --> 58:12.130
So this freak gonna tell me
she know this dude.

58:12.233 --> 58:14.667
So you know, I'm like,
"Where'd you meet him from?"

58:14.769 --> 58:18.967
So she gonna be on some old,
"Yeah, he busted
a friend of my family."

58:19.073 --> 58:21.439
- You know what I mean?
So I'm like, "Busted?"
- What?

58:21.542 --> 58:24.739
She said, "Yeah, that mother fucker
a cop. Fooled everybody."

58:24.846 --> 58:27.110
Talkin' about you without a doubt.
The pig that brought him down, man.

58:27.215 --> 58:30.150
- No, we were..
- You a cop, J. ?

58:31.953 --> 58:35.616
- What you think?
- I think you know
the answer to that, clown.

58:39.861 --> 58:42.728
Well, girl, she gotta
be tellin' the truth.
Why is she just gonna lie?

58:42.830 --> 58:45.492
- What are you sayin', she's
gotta be tellin' the truth?
- Just like I said, brother.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.034
- You believin' everything these
tramps is out here talkin'?
- No, no.

58:48.136 --> 58:50.161
Huh? So then
what you talkin' about?

58:50.271 --> 58:52.637
- I put my man on it.
- You know all these broads
went in with the weight.

58:52.740 --> 58:54.833
- Yo, Tique.
Tique, Tique, Tique.
- What?

58:54.942 --> 58:56.842
How long you know
this bitch?

58:56.944 --> 58:59.037
- For a few weeks.
- A few weeks.

58:59.147 --> 59:01.547
- Matter of fact,
bring the bitch down here.
- I ain't bringin' her nowhere.

59:01.649 --> 59:03.879
- Fuck that.
Bring that bitch down here.
- Get that shit out of here.

59:03.985 --> 59:07.182
See me smack her around
the fuckin' room, then you
ask her if I'm a fuckin' cop.

59:07.288 --> 59:09.188
- What's that shit mean to me?
- What you mean, what it mean to you?

59:09.323 --> 59:11.223
- You vouchin' for the bitch!
- I ain't vouchin' for shit!

59:11.359 --> 59:13.259
- We here right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:13.327 --> 59:18.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I tell you what.
Don't you worry about it, J.

59:18.499 --> 59:21.059
- What you talkin',
don't worry about it, man?
- Yo, don't worry.

59:21.169 --> 59:23.831
She messin' up my money, dog.
She messin' up
my business with you, dog.

59:23.938 --> 59:25.838
- She ain't messin' up nothin'.
- So what the fuck
is you talkin' about?

59:25.940 --> 59:29.603
Calm down, cowboy.
Don't be screamin' in my
mother fuckin' office, dog.

59:29.710 --> 59:31.610
- Relax.
- Yeah.

59:34.916 --> 59:37.942
Come on down to the basement.
I wanna show you somethin'.

59:41.756 --> 59:45.351
Yo, yo, yo. Obviously, you
got some business to handle.

59:45.493 --> 59:48.792
I ain't got no mother fuck..
Just keep it movin'.

01:00:00.608 --> 01:00:03.042
You punk-ass,
bitch-ass nigga.

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:06.773
Thought you were badder, badder,
badder and badder, fool.

01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:09.907
You ain't nothin' but
a lame-ass dude, huh?

01:00:10.017 --> 01:00:12.542
- You know, I know.
- Che, shut the fuck up.

01:00:12.653 --> 01:00:15.918
Oh, Frisco!

01:00:16.057 --> 01:00:19.288
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Say, yo, what's up
with all this, dog?

01:00:19.427 --> 01:00:21.691
I guess you see my man here
bleedin', all fucked up,

01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:24.559
you say, "Damn, God,
what a foul nigger," right?

01:00:24.665 --> 01:00:28.328
- I'm just sayin'..
- But you see, this here's
some fucked up shit.

01:00:28.436 --> 01:00:31.496
Me and this nigga went to
junior high together, played
in the mother fuckin' sandbox.

01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:35.872
And out of all the bitches
in the world, you wanna try to
step to my baby's moms?

01:00:35.977 --> 01:00:39.674
- Yo, I was drunk, man.
- Man, shut the fuck up
that you was drunk!

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.840
Now I'm drunk
with revenge, mother fucker!

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.783
- All I did was tell her
she was beautiful, man.
- Shut up, man!

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.911
- Give me the pool stick.
- Come on, man.
We ain't gotta rock like this.

01:00:48.055 --> 01:00:53.118
Ain't gotta rock like this?
We gonna rock like what?

01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:57.992
Rock like what?

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.500
Give me another pool stick.

01:01:01.602 --> 01:01:03.502
What's up, J. Reid?

01:01:03.604 --> 01:01:07.665
- This is God's world.
- God, man.. Come on, man.

01:01:07.775 --> 01:01:10.539
- Let me go, man.
Why are you wildin' out?
- What? Why I'm wildin' out?

01:01:10.645 --> 01:01:12.545
- You're supposed to be my man.
- I am your man.

01:01:12.647 --> 01:01:16.981
Yo, God, come on, man.
Please, man. Yo.

01:01:17.084 --> 01:01:19.075
- And I'm gonna prove
it, mother fucker.
- I'm sorry, man.

01:01:24.992 --> 01:01:26.892
Love it!
Love it!

01:01:26.994 --> 01:01:30.395
Love it! Think about her!
Think about her!

01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:32.590
Think about her!
Think about her!

01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:35.634
Think about her!
Think about her!

01:01:35.736 --> 01:01:39.695
- What do you mean, tortured?
- I mean, he beat
the kid half dead.

01:01:39.807 --> 01:01:43.334
- Why didn't you call
for immediate backup?
- It was a judgment call.

01:01:43.444 --> 01:01:47.574
Why blow the whole operation?
Look, he didn't kill the kid.

01:01:47.682 --> 01:01:49.650
How do you know he didn't?

01:01:51.953 --> 01:01:54.080
I don't need your shit, Wilson.

01:01:54.222 --> 01:01:57.453
- What is this, a fuckin' inquisition?
- No.

01:01:57.558 --> 01:02:01.426
We just have to make sure
you didn't take any part in this.

01:02:01.529 --> 01:02:04.657
Excuse me.
I know the procedure, okay?

01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:07.734
Torturing a brother
is not my thing, all right?

01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:09.962
- All right.
- A brother?

01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:12.733
What the.. What the fuck
is your problem?

01:02:12.907 --> 01:02:16.468
I don't have a problem.
He may be your brother,
but he ain't no brother of mine.

01:02:16.577 --> 01:02:19.876
You know what, Pres?
You should've sat this bitch
down a long time ago.

01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:22.745
- That's enough.
- Look, Cole.

01:02:25.586 --> 01:02:30.489
You know, you are
becoming just like the shit
we trying to throw down.

01:02:32.793 --> 01:02:35.762
Get out of my face.

01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:38.627
Go push some papers or somethin'.
You can't even get wires straight.

01:02:45.206 --> 01:02:48.505
- Okay.
- What was that?

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:51.305
What was that?

01:02:51.412 --> 01:02:55.212
- I'd say that was
totally unprofessional, Cole.
- Oh, you'd say?

01:02:55.316 --> 01:02:59.047
And who the fuck are you?
The D.E.A.?

01:02:59.153 --> 01:03:03.089
You can't even get a guy to go
undercover long enough without
asking for an extended vacation.

01:03:03.224 --> 01:03:06.284
At least I know
who the enemy is.

01:03:13.234 --> 01:03:15.395
Jeff?

01:03:15.503 --> 01:03:17.596
Wait there. Wait. Leave
him alone. Leave him alone.

01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:19.673
He's totally out of control.

01:03:19.774 --> 01:03:22.834
That's why Gittens trusts
him. He believes him.

01:03:22.943 --> 01:03:25.275
Connelly was right.

01:03:25.379 --> 01:03:28.280
Nobody will ever
get in this far again.

01:03:30.418 --> 01:03:33.148
That's all you care about,
isn't it?

01:03:37.425 --> 01:03:40.826
Mmm. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:43.726
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03:45.566 --> 01:03:47.466
Can I get
another cup of coffee?

01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:56.270
- Let me ask you boys somethin'.
- What's up?

01:03:58.212 --> 01:04:00.112
God treatin' you all right
with the money?

01:04:00.214 --> 01:04:04.583
He's payin'.
Banana money.

01:04:04.685 --> 01:04:08.177
Only real cash he layin'
out going to that posse
he come up from Jersey with.

01:04:08.289 --> 01:04:11.747
Word. He ain't
gonna start payin' us
Cincinnati dudes, right,

01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:13.883
till we prove ourselves.

01:04:14.028 --> 01:04:16.963
But he never say
when that is.

01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:20.522
Me and Che been bustin' our ass
for two fuckin' years now.

01:04:20.668 --> 01:04:23.603
Why don't you ask
him for a raise?

01:04:23.704 --> 01:04:28.038
- Give up.
- What?

01:04:28.142 --> 01:04:32.442
And wind up butt-ass
naked on his pool table?
I ain't feelin' that.

01:04:32.546 --> 01:04:35.947
Nah, ain't worth
the risk, man.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:39.383
God got us where he wants
and he ain't givin' us no way out.

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:44.984
I tell you what.

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:52.831
It's on love, right?

01:04:52.933 --> 01:04:57.267
- It's on the love.
- Just a little somethin', you know?

01:04:57.371 --> 01:05:01.034
- Whoo!
- Show more love.

01:05:01.142 --> 01:05:03.736
Keep your mouth wet.

01:05:03.844 --> 01:05:06.039
What we gotta
do for this?

01:05:06.147 --> 01:05:08.047
- What you gotta do for it?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.149 --> 01:05:10.208
Why don't you get
that waitress' number for me.

01:05:12.353 --> 01:05:14.446
- Her? That's it?
- Yeah. That's it.

01:05:14.555 --> 01:05:18.616
For this? Yo, let me go
politic that right now.

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:29.864
J. Reid. You definitely know how
to treat a brother, huh?

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:40.547
Shit. Actin' like this,
you can be H.N.I.C. around here
if you's down for it.

01:06:09.877 --> 01:06:13.904
God, he's smart.

01:06:15.683 --> 01:06:18.550
He's just gonna keep findin'
a way to slip through the net.

01:06:20.588 --> 01:06:22.647
Till somebody takes him out.

01:06:24.091 --> 01:06:27.458
- It's simple and plain.
- It's not yourjob.

01:06:33.868 --> 01:06:36.359
Mother fucker's slippin', man.

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.166
Treats his boys like shit.

01:06:39.273 --> 01:06:43.767
Makes them feel scared
and under appreciated.

01:06:45.846 --> 01:06:48.041
I tell you what, though.

01:06:48.148 --> 01:06:53.780
One of them young cats,
them little mother fuckers, man,
they'd smoke him in a second.

01:06:56.924 --> 01:06:59.916
Hand the whole shit
over to me.

01:07:11.539 --> 01:07:14.838
When was the last time
you talked to Myra?

01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:22.239
Pres, that's none of
your fuckin' business.

01:07:29.056 --> 01:07:31.650
Myra's a good girl,
you know?

01:07:33.827 --> 01:07:37.729
She really is.

01:07:37.831 --> 01:07:40.391
She's all worried about me
gettin' fucked up and..

01:07:44.071 --> 01:07:47.404
Besides, man, I-I-I really don't think
she wants to see me anymore.

01:07:52.746 --> 01:07:56.807
Well, I think it might not be a
bad idea to give her a call anyway.

01:07:56.917 --> 01:08:00.250
Hear her voice.

01:08:00.354 --> 01:08:02.254
Let her know how you are.

01:08:10.097 --> 01:08:13.260
I, um..

01:08:16.036 --> 01:08:19.062
I..
I can't do this.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.974
I don't know what you mean.
What are you talkin' about?

01:08:24.078 --> 01:08:26.478
I can't live like this
anymore.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.479
Live like what?

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.377
Like..

01:08:34.822 --> 01:08:37.518
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:41.152
Like wondering if I'm gonna
open the newspaper...

01:08:41.295 --> 01:08:44.229
and see, "Undercover Cop
Killed In The Line Of Duty."

01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:48.461
- So why did you agree
to meet me here?
- Jeff, you have your life.

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:53.268
You're happy. It's fun.
Yourjob is exciting for you.
I'm happy for you.

01:08:53.374 --> 01:08:56.901
I just know that I cannot
be a part of it anymore.

01:09:07.087 --> 01:09:10.453
- See all these niggers out here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:10.557 --> 01:09:13.651
Strugglin' to survive, man.

01:09:13.794 --> 01:09:17.457
When you're strugglin' to survive,
you need somebody to follow.

01:09:17.564 --> 01:09:21.193
So I figured,
why not give 'em God?

01:09:21.301 --> 01:09:25.897
Like these freaks who let us
use their apartments for free.

01:09:26.006 --> 01:09:29.464
It's not only that we payin'
their rent or give them a free
supply, whatever they're usin'.

01:09:29.576 --> 01:09:33.205
That ain'tjust it.
Mother fuckers wanna feel like
they're a part of somethin'.

01:09:33.313 --> 01:09:35.975
Man, black people in this country,

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:39.712
they wanna feel like they
are a part of somethin'.

01:09:39.853 --> 01:09:42.582
- No doubt.
- Stick around, J.

01:09:42.689 --> 01:09:44.590
I'm gonna school ya.

01:09:47.795 --> 01:09:49.990
I ain't had nobody tight
since Frisco.

01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:53.464
- You gotta do what you gotta do.
- Mother fuckin' right. I always do.

01:09:53.567 --> 01:09:57.059
Ain't that right, little man?
Yeah, that's my little man.

01:09:57.171 --> 01:10:00.436
Let me ask you somethin',
dog. How much?

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:04.477
- How much what?
- How much the empire worth?

01:10:07.514 --> 01:10:09.505
Eleven million.

01:10:09.616 --> 01:10:12.483
I can feel that.

01:10:12.586 --> 01:10:15.316
I can feel that like a
mother fucker, man.

01:10:15.422 --> 01:10:17.822
- Been lookin' for these mother fuckers.
- Who that?

01:10:17.925 --> 01:10:20.393
Bitch Nisey and this nigger.

01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:39.279
No!

01:10:39.379 --> 01:10:42.212
Leave him alone!

01:10:42.316 --> 01:10:45.012
Leave him alone!

01:10:47.588 --> 01:10:50.716
You and your man gonna rob
me, bitch? Gonna rob me?

01:10:50.858 --> 01:10:52.723
Huh? You gonna rob me,
you stinkin' mother fucker?

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.260
You guys got it wrong, man!
You got it wrong!

01:10:55.362 --> 01:10:58.126
No!

01:10:58.232 --> 01:11:00.564
- Get up! Get up!
- What the hell is wrong, man?

01:11:00.667 --> 01:11:04.398
Who the fuck is God? Point
at him! Point at him, bitch!

01:11:16.016 --> 01:11:19.315
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Get the fuck up! Get up!

01:11:19.419 --> 01:11:21.944
Put the mother fucker's arm
in the doorjam! Put him over here!

01:11:22.089 --> 01:11:24.216
Put your arm in there, cowboy!
Put your arm in there, cowboy!

01:11:24.358 --> 01:11:27.054
Take it! Take it!
Take it!

01:11:27.161 --> 01:11:30.324
Mother fucker! How does it feel?
Fuckin' faggot!

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:32.955
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:11:33.066 --> 01:11:36.058
Where you go in', bitch?

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:40.266
Get the fuck up!
Stinky mother fucker! Huh?

01:11:40.374 --> 01:11:42.808
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth! Yeah.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.311
Yeah, you like that, huh?
Huh? Yeah, suck on it!

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:50.008
You wanna suck on
the mother fuckin' pipe, right?
Suck on this, bitch! Yeah!

01:11:50.117 --> 01:11:53.484
What you think ,J. ?
What you think, baby?

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:57.613
Man, fuck this bitch, man.
She dyin' slow anyway, man.

01:11:57.691 --> 01:12:01.127
You know, there's people
out here, dog. Come on.

01:12:01.228 --> 01:12:03.560
Who am I, bitch?
Who am I?

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:06.326
- Who am I?
- God!

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:19.877
That stinkin' mother
fuckin' bitch!

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.210
Yo, what's up with
little man, man?

01:12:22.316 --> 01:12:24.978
Nah, it smells like
he messed up his diaper.
You'll be all right, Boo-Boo.

01:12:26.887 --> 01:12:31.085
Know what?
Before we done,

01:12:31.225 --> 01:12:34.160
you and me gonna be runnin'
this whole state, man.

01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:36.991
I don't know, man.

01:12:38.298 --> 01:12:42.359
Look, you got my back,
I got yours.

01:12:44.504 --> 01:12:48.372
I ain't never seen you
back down to nothin' or
nobody including me,

01:12:48.475 --> 01:12:52.241
which means sooner or
later I'm gonna have to
murder you before you do me.

01:12:54.615 --> 01:12:59.075
So you can make up your mind
one way or the other.

01:12:59.186 --> 01:13:02.587
You'll be all right, Boo-Boo.
I know. I know.

01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:06.352
- I know. You okay?
- What's wrong, little man?

01:13:06.493 --> 01:13:09.724
I know. I know.
It's cold.

01:13:11.231 --> 01:13:14.530
Anyway, it's set up
for tomorrow night.

01:13:14.635 --> 01:13:17.103
Make up your mind
one way or the other,

01:13:17.204 --> 01:13:21.300
'cause you ain't makin' a
contact unless you down solid.

01:13:50.003 --> 01:13:52.665
- It is. That was good, though.
- It was good.

01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:55.537
- I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

01:13:55.642 --> 01:13:58.736
- So, I think we're supposed to
be in at around 4:00 tomorrow.
- Sounds good to me.

01:13:58.845 --> 01:14:02.975
Okay, see you. Bye.

01:14:09.856 --> 01:14:11.721
What's up, girl?

01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:14.156
I guess you just happened
to be driving by, huh?

01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:18.163
Nah, nah. I've been out here
for, like, two hours.

01:14:18.298 --> 01:14:22.291
Tried you at home.
I figured you were down here
doing your thing.

01:14:23.704 --> 01:14:27.071
I was checkin' you out.
You looked pretty good up there.

01:14:29.676 --> 01:14:32.941
Jeff, I thought we already..
I thought we talked about
this thing already.

01:14:33.046 --> 01:14:35.742
I know, I know, I know.
I couldn't stay away.

01:14:35.849 --> 01:14:37.840
That's, you know..
That's why I didn't come
inside or nothin'.

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:39.942
I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

01:14:42.022 --> 01:14:45.480
Um, listen, I've been, um,
modeling since this morning.

01:14:45.592 --> 01:14:47.526
I've been rehearsing
all afternoon. I'm tired.

01:14:47.627 --> 01:14:49.527
I just want to go home
and get into bed.

01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:53.326
Baby, you can't hang out
for a few?

01:14:53.433 --> 01:14:58.769
Huh? I just wanna talk to
you. I just wanna..
I just wanna hear your voice.

01:15:01.308 --> 01:15:03.367
What's up, baby?

01:15:03.477 --> 01:15:05.570
What's up?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.875
So, um, let me
ask you somethin'.

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:14.511
- That's your new boyfriend?
- Who?

01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:16.953
The boy over there
who was kissin' on you.

01:15:17.057 --> 01:15:21.050
- Jeff, come on.
That's my dance partner.
- Oh, right.

01:15:21.194 --> 01:15:23.094
Hmm.

01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:26.331
You sleepin' with him?

01:15:28.368 --> 01:15:30.802
No! What..
You know what?

01:15:30.904 --> 01:15:33.566
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:33.673 --> 01:15:37.666
I'm sorry. Close your door.
Close the door.

01:15:39.112 --> 01:15:43.776
- What's wrong?
- Don't talk to me like that, okay?

01:15:43.884 --> 01:15:46.352
He was over there kissin'
on you and all that, you know?

01:15:46.453 --> 01:15:48.978
- We work together.
He's my friend, okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:15:49.122 --> 01:15:51.386
- I'm not..
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:55.621
Let's start off fresh.
Give me a kiss, baby.

01:15:55.762 --> 01:16:00.426
- I don't want a kiss. Jeff, I
don't want to kiss you right..
- Kiss me.

01:16:02.936 --> 01:16:05.871
- What you runnin' away for?
What are you scared of, baby?
- Don't, Jeff!. Don't..

01:16:05.972 --> 01:16:09.169
Damn!

01:16:11.244 --> 01:16:13.542
Excuse me, ma'am,
is there a problem here this evening?

01:16:13.647 --> 01:16:15.547
There's no problem
here, man.

01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:19.608
- We just had an argument.
- Excuse me, sir. I was
talkin' to the lady.

01:16:19.719 --> 01:16:21.949
- Look, I'm a cop. I'm on the job.
- We just had an argument.

01:16:22.089 --> 01:16:23.920
I'm just having a little problem
with my lady, that's all.

01:16:24.024 --> 01:16:26.458
Sir, why don't you come over to the
car and we'll settle it there, huh?

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.120
- There's no need for me
to go to the car.
- Let's go over to the car.

01:16:29.262 --> 01:16:32.197
Please, Officer, stop.
He's a cop. He's not lying.

01:16:32.332 --> 01:16:35.096
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- What are you, stupid?

01:16:35.202 --> 01:16:38.399
- Huh? Didn't I just
fuckin' tell you I'm a cop?
- Okay.

01:16:38.505 --> 01:16:42.566
- All right, look. All right.
Nobody's being stupid.
- Don't be stupid.

01:16:42.676 --> 01:16:44.337
- Back the fuck up!
- Jeff, no!

01:16:44.444 --> 01:16:47.072
You said you were a cop,
right? Then you know the..

01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.172
- Move it!
- What are you doing?

01:16:50.283 --> 01:16:52.410
Son of a bitch!

01:16:52.519 --> 01:16:56.319
- You wanna play?
- Let him go! Let him go!

01:16:56.423 --> 01:16:59.824
He's a cop!
He's not lying! Please!

01:17:01.695 --> 01:17:04.823
It's too late for this.
We have no time for "I told you so's."

01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:10.267
We're talking about potentially
the biggest drug bust
in the history of this state.

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.600
And I still think Cole
can get us there.

01:17:12.706 --> 01:17:16.142
It's not Cole that you're talking about.
That's what you don't understand.

01:17:16.243 --> 01:17:18.143
He doesn't know
who the fuck he is.

01:17:18.245 --> 01:17:21.442
He doesn't know what he's
gonna do when he's J. Reid.
You saw what happened last night.

01:17:21.548 --> 01:17:23.717
He understands
what he did last night.

01:17:23.717 --> 01:17:25.844
He's sorry for that.
He's fully conscious.

01:17:25.952 --> 01:17:29.615
He doesn't know what the fuck he did
last night, and he's not sorry.

01:17:29.756 --> 01:17:32.782
You act like he
spilled a glass of water.

01:17:32.926 --> 01:17:36.862
The court accepted a plea
of extreme circumstance
involving an officer on duty.

01:17:38.365 --> 01:17:40.629
- Oh, my God.
- We gotta go.

01:17:40.734 --> 01:17:43.202
I think it's definitely
worth the risk.

01:17:43.303 --> 01:17:47.171
But it's not your risk
to take, is it? It's his.

01:17:47.274 --> 01:17:51.335
Look, if you put Jeff back in,
he will never find his way out.

01:17:51.444 --> 01:17:54.345
It's just for tonight.
That's all. We need him wired.

01:17:54.447 --> 01:17:56.347
We need to have him wired
so that we can find out...

01:17:56.449 --> 01:17:58.849
who Gittens' supplier is
and nail them both.

01:17:58.952 --> 01:18:00.886
Then it'll be over.

01:18:13.767 --> 01:18:15.667
Are you there, Jeff?.

01:18:15.769 --> 01:18:19.330
I need you to meet me so you
can tell me what's going down.

01:18:22.042 --> 01:18:24.840
Come on, Jeff. Pick up
the phone if you're there.

01:18:26.012 --> 01:18:27.912
Jeff?.

01:19:14.194 --> 01:19:17.925
Yo, this is where they're
meeting you at, dog?

01:19:18.031 --> 01:19:20.397
Yeah.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.196
This crazy mother fucker
might be here already.

01:19:27.641 --> 01:19:29.871
He called me between
Chicago and here like an hour ago.

01:19:31.378 --> 01:19:33.608
Let's cut that mother fucker
off. Just go direct, man.

01:19:36.082 --> 01:19:38.346
Mexicans don't fuck
with niggers.

01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:42.148
The federales there, they get
all hectic. They get crazy.

01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:44.780
The shit is just off the rockers.
Them taco-eatin' mother fuckers...

01:19:44.924 --> 01:19:48.325
do not like no niggers
down in Mexico.

01:19:51.898 --> 01:19:55.129
It's easier to do it this
way, you know? Good prices.

01:19:59.172 --> 01:20:01.640
It's cool.

01:20:01.741 --> 01:20:04.972
- Yo. You all right?
- What's up?

01:20:05.078 --> 01:20:08.605
- We're here, right?
- No doubt.

01:20:29.269 --> 01:20:33.638
- What's up, Murph?
- What's up, homey?

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:36.265
- How y'all?
- Chillin'. What's goin' on, baby?

01:20:36.376 --> 01:20:38.276
I'm all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not too personal.

01:20:38.378 --> 01:20:41.472
- How you doin', man?
- I'm good.

01:20:41.614 --> 01:20:45.209
- What's goin' on, Thug Life?
- What's up?

01:20:50.457 --> 01:20:53.051
Who's the new eggplant, man?

01:20:53.193 --> 01:20:55.991
Why don't you knock it off
with the insults. That's my man.

01:20:56.096 --> 01:20:58.360
What happened to Frisco?

01:20:58.465 --> 01:21:01.195
Frisco, he's old news, man.

01:21:02.969 --> 01:21:06.769
Frisco's old news?
What are you? You new news?

01:21:09.843 --> 01:21:12.107
Murph, can we speed
up this process, man?

01:21:12.212 --> 01:21:15.045
Who is this guy?
Are you a cop?

01:21:15.148 --> 01:21:18.515
Yo, Murph, Come on
cut the crap.

01:21:18.618 --> 01:21:20.609
Let's do business.
All right, man?

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.688
- I just wanna figure out
who I'm dealing with.
- Yo, Murph.

01:21:22.789 --> 01:21:24.780
Let's do business.

01:21:27.861 --> 01:21:31.854
- Are you a cop?
- What the fuck do you mean
is he a cop, mother fucker?

01:21:31.965 --> 01:21:36.095
- Don't insult me.
- All right. Look, I just wanna
know who I'm doin' business with.

01:21:36.236 --> 01:21:38.136
You're doin' business
with me, mother fucker!

01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:41.139
- You want me to take
my money somewhere else?
- No, we're gonna do this. Alright?

01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:43.334
Next time just call me
and let me know you're
gonna bring some new guy.

01:21:43.476 --> 01:21:47.378
Yeah.
Let's do what we gotta do, man.

01:21:47.447 --> 01:21:50.075
Hey, watch the car, man!

01:21:50.183 --> 01:21:52.515
Sorry about that, God.

01:21:52.619 --> 01:21:56.578
Hey, you got enough cocaine
here, you can buy
a whole fuckin' fleet.

01:21:58.525 --> 01:22:00.459
Just take it easy, man.

01:22:03.997 --> 01:22:05.897
All right.

01:22:12.939 --> 01:22:15.772
- It's all right?
- Come on, man.
What's with that bullshit?

01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:19.311
What's the problem, man?
What, you can count my money,
I can't taste your stuff?.

01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:22.438
- 'Cause you're a nigger, Dwayne.
- Hey, fuck you, trailer trash.

01:22:22.549 --> 01:22:26.178
You're lrish, but you're no Kennedy,
Murph. Believe that.

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:29.221
- Let's go.
- That's it.

01:22:33.059 --> 01:22:35.789
- It's all good. What the fuck?
- Shit!

01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:41.860
This is Agent Scott. You're
surrounded by the D.E.A.

01:22:41.968 --> 01:22:45.460
- Drop your weapons and come
out with your hands up!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.106
- Let's go! Come on!
- Go, go, go!

01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:52.838
- Let's go!
- I knew you were a cop.

01:22:52.946 --> 01:22:54.971
J, watch out!

01:22:58.351 --> 01:23:01.514
Put the mother fuckin'
gun down, Thug!

01:23:01.621 --> 01:23:04.454
- Put the mother fuckin'
gun down! Don't be stupid!
- Put it down!

01:23:04.557 --> 01:23:09.119
- Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker!
- Put the gun down!

01:23:17.637 --> 01:23:20.401
Put the gun down.

01:23:20.507 --> 01:23:23.271
Put that gun down!

01:23:30.283 --> 01:23:34.014
I hear him breathing. Why
isn't he giving us the signal?

01:23:41.294 --> 01:23:45.162
Abel One, Baker One. Do you
request backup at this time?

01:23:45.265 --> 01:23:47.893
Hold it.

01:23:50.303 --> 01:23:52.203
What are you..
What are you doing?

01:23:54.307 --> 01:23:57.970
Abel One, Baker One.
Are you ready for entry?

01:23:58.077 --> 01:24:02.241
J, put the gun down, man.

01:24:04.817 --> 01:24:08.719
J, I got
a 600-dollar-an-hour lawyer.

01:24:08.855 --> 01:24:13.554
We'll be out by the morning.
Put the fuckin' gun down, man.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:16.128
You have ten seconds!

01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:18.129
Wait.

01:24:22.402 --> 01:24:25.462
Put the gun down.

01:24:25.572 --> 01:24:30.305
Put the gun down.

01:24:46.259 --> 01:24:49.228
It's crazy, you know?
It's all a misunderstanding.

01:24:49.796 --> 01:24:53.197
How you doin' today, Officer?

01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:56.063
Could you take it easy? It's
all just a big misunderstanding.

01:24:56.169 --> 01:24:59.696
Officer Cole,
would you do the honors?

01:24:59.806 --> 01:25:01.706
Read Mr. Gittens
his rights.

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:06.210
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Go ahead, Jeff.

01:25:06.312 --> 01:25:11.045
Read him his rights. I'm
gonna play him the tape you made.

01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:13.744
He'd love to hear
his own voice.

01:25:21.694 --> 01:25:23.924
- You a cop?
- Come on, Jeff.

01:25:26.065 --> 01:25:28.966
You did it.
You brought us home.

01:25:29.068 --> 01:25:31.696
- You have the right
to remain silent.
- You a cop, mother fucker?

01:25:31.804 --> 01:25:34.238
Anything you say can
and will be held against
you in a court of law.

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.240
You have the right to an
attorney. If you can't afford one,

01:25:36.342 --> 01:25:38.242
one will be appointed
to you.

01:25:38.344 --> 01:25:42.144
- At any time during questioning..
- All I wanted to do was
be there for you, dog.

01:25:42.248 --> 01:25:47.117
All I did was be there for you.
That's all I did.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:51.213
Huh, J. Reid?
You ain't no cop!

01:25:52.525 --> 01:25:54.652
You ain't no cop, J. Reid!

01:26:01.034 --> 01:26:03.161
You're a sellout!

01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:32.222
Now the hard part begins.

01:26:32.365 --> 01:26:37.462
I know a doctor who works with cops.
He'll know what you've been through.

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.629
This is gonna take
some time, Jeff.

01:26:39.739 --> 01:26:43.869
Who we may have betrayed.

01:26:43.976 --> 01:26:46.968
Who wants to talk about it?

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.380
How about you, Jeff?.
Maybe you can bring some
fresh perspective to the group.

01:26:51.484 --> 01:26:56.854
Any cop who was undercover
as long as you were...

01:26:56.956 --> 01:27:00.323
is bound to have some
lasting imprint.

01:27:00.426 --> 01:27:02.394
You crossed the line.

01:27:04.097 --> 01:27:07.624
But that's the reason
Gittens let you in so deep,

01:27:07.767 --> 01:27:10.565
and that's the reason your
testimony could put him away.

01:27:13.406 --> 01:27:16.432
- Tape make you nervous?
- About what?

01:27:16.542 --> 01:27:20.672
I wanna see him
face to face.

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.442
Put that bastard
in his place.

01:27:23.549 --> 01:27:28.213
I was undercover, and, uh..

01:27:28.321 --> 01:27:32.155
He tried to kill me.

01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:34.589
The guy called himself God.

01:27:34.694 --> 01:27:39.927
So, you know, I'm ridin' around
with him, playin' my part.

01:28:05.825 --> 01:28:08.521
You know what?

01:28:08.661 --> 01:28:10.561
I just, uh..

01:28:13.533 --> 01:28:18.300
I just wanted to see you,
'cause I wanted you to
know that I'm sorry.

01:28:18.404 --> 01:28:21.396
I fucked up.

01:28:21.507 --> 01:28:25.068
I messed up big time.
I never meant to hurt you.

01:28:30.216 --> 01:28:32.946
You gotta believe me.
I never meant to hurt you.

01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:37.847
I love you, Jeff,

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:40.288
butjust because
two people love each other,

01:28:40.426 --> 01:28:42.860
it does not mean that they're
supposed to be together.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.300
Who was in charge...

01:28:49.402 --> 01:28:53.270
when you started buying
mass quantities of cocaine
from the New York gang?

01:28:53.372 --> 01:28:57.240
Dwayne Gittens,
known on the street as God.

01:28:57.343 --> 01:29:00.744
- Did Mr. Gittens ever deliver
these goods to you personally?
- On occasion.

01:29:00.847 --> 01:29:04.749
Officer Cole, would
you be so kind as to point
Mr. Gittens out to the jury?

01:29:04.884 --> 01:29:08.877
Certainly. He's the gentleman
seated to the far right
with the bald head.

01:29:11.691 --> 01:29:14.660
Hey, yo, J
Officer Jeff Cole.

01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:21.429
- What's up, man? Look at you.
- What's goin' on, Breezy?

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.832
What's goin' on?

01:29:23.936 --> 01:29:26.837
Thanks for puttin' in
the good word, man.

01:29:26.939 --> 01:29:31.069
You're the one that
decided to testify, man.
You did the right thing.

01:29:31.177 --> 01:29:33.668
Yeah.

01:29:33.779 --> 01:29:36.179
I'll guess I'll see you
in about three and a half.

01:29:37.516 --> 01:29:40.246
Be strong, man.

01:29:40.353 --> 01:29:44.517
Dwayne Keith Gittens, you've
been found guilty by this jury...

01:29:44.624 --> 01:29:47.092
of all the crimes in which
you've been accused.

01:29:47.226 --> 01:29:51.128
Therefore, this court
sentences you to a penalty
of two consecutive life terms...

01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:55.189
without the possibility of parole.

01:29:57.536 --> 01:29:59.970
- But I would like to say this.
- Thank you.

01:30:00.106 --> 01:30:02.836
I feel really good
about what happened today.

01:30:02.942 --> 01:30:05.934
We did the job
we set out to do.

01:30:06.045 --> 01:30:11.005
Dwayne Gittens and 16members of
the toughest drug organization
operating in this state...

01:30:11.117 --> 01:30:13.517
have been brought down.

01:30:15.388 --> 01:30:19.085
On be half of the D.E.A.,
I would just like to express...

01:30:19.225 --> 01:30:21.386
my deep thanks to
State Attorney Connelly...

01:30:21.527 --> 01:30:24.792
and all the local
police agencies.

01:30:24.897 --> 01:30:26.922
We were fortunate
to have them with us.

01:30:27.033 --> 01:30:29.900
This was a joint effort.
We couldn't have done it without them.

01:30:30.002 --> 01:30:33.028
Now, this operation
may have taken years.

01:30:33.139 --> 01:30:36.006
We needed to be sure
that we could deliver a blow...

01:30:36.108 --> 01:30:38.576
from which this gang
could never recover.

01:30:38.678 --> 01:30:43.911
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is just the blow that was dealt
to Dwayne Gittens.

01:30:44.016 --> 01:30:47.543
If you look around at the
positive changes that have..

01:30:47.653 --> 01:30:51.419
You know, everybody that matters
knows who the real hero is.

01:30:51.524 --> 01:30:55.620
I didn't get into this
war to be a hero.

01:30:59.332 --> 01:31:02.301
Do you.. Do you really
have to go tomorrow?

01:31:02.401 --> 01:31:05.700
Preston says
it's safer that way.

01:31:05.805 --> 01:31:10.970
Besides, those rookies
in Chicago have no idea
what they're in for.

01:31:11.077 --> 01:31:13.477
You know, I've been thinkin'.

01:31:13.579 --> 01:31:17.276
It's not like you could just
pick up and leave or anything,

01:31:17.383 --> 01:31:20.318
but, you know,
you should come with me.

01:31:22.555 --> 01:31:26.082
I got a little
two-bedroom apartment.

01:31:26.225 --> 01:31:29.126
Turn one of 'em into
a dance studio or something.

01:31:33.065 --> 01:31:37.798
A friend of mine was telling
me that they got, like, great
dance companies in Chicago.

01:31:37.903 --> 01:31:40.599
Oh, don't try to
sell me on Chicago.

01:31:40.706 --> 01:31:43.698
Well, you know, I'm just passin'
off information, that's all.

01:31:43.809 --> 01:31:45.709
I know.

01:31:47.747 --> 01:31:50.409
I can go to Chicago
and run things, huh?

01:31:54.453 --> 01:31:56.978
Any other bright
ideas out there?

01:31:59.358 --> 01:32:02.259
Somebody help me out.
Come on.

01:32:02.361 --> 01:32:04.261
Oh, come on.

01:32:07.166 --> 01:32:11.364
You're holdin' that gun.
Time is runnin' out.

01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:14.803
Your brain..
Your brain is vaporized,
like ten minutes ago,

01:32:14.907 --> 01:32:18.502
and your heart, your heart
is dancing on your tongue.

01:32:24.183 --> 01:32:27.778
We're talkin' about
your life out there.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.820
Your life.

01:34:09.555 --> 01:34:11.455
Here we go
Here we go
