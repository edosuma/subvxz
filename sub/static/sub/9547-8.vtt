00:16.395 --> 00:17.545
What was that?

00:17.796 --> 00:18.929
I'll call you back.

00:27.931 --> 00:28.931
Valerie?

00:34.756 --> 00:35.989
The door was open.

00:38.969 --> 00:39.969
John?

00:41.581 --> 00:42.648
Are you okay?

00:43.190 --> 00:44.190
Oh, my god.

00:56.169 --> 00:58.135
Somebody call the police!

00:58.314 --> 01:00.639
Please!
Please help!

01:05.120 --> 01:08.773
Mr. Monk, 14 years ago you were the
chief investigator of this crime scene.

01:08.847 --> 01:11.480
It was your testimony that put
max barton behind bars.

01:11.566 --> 01:14.678
As you know, mr. Barton's eligible
to be paroled at the end of this month.

01:14.711 --> 01:17.588
I understand you'd like to make
a statement before our final decision.

01:17.621 --> 01:18.974
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

01:19.061 --> 01:22.501
I've been a homicide investigator
for more than 20 years.

01:22.551 --> 01:26.365
I have seen more crime scenes
than I could possibly count.

01:26.431 --> 01:28.265
Well, 410, but...

01:28.407 --> 01:29.740
That's not the point.

01:30.081 --> 01:33.297
What I saw that 
morning in that house

01:34.817 --> 01:37.851
was beyond imagination.
What he did

01:38.115 --> 01:42.399
to those people, the...
The husband had been tortured.

01:42.598 --> 01:45.498
We found the wife in the backyard.
She had...

01:47.942 --> 01:50.775
She had tried
to crawl away...

01:52.511 --> 01:53.828
Take your time, mr. Monk.

01:54.144 --> 01:57.211
I've tried to forget it,
but I can't.

01:57.251 --> 02:00.171
And I'm sure that sarah mcnally,
who found the bodies,

02:00.271 --> 02:01.838
will never forget it either.

02:04.649 --> 02:08.805
Putting people like max barton behind
bars is the reason I became a cop.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.737
In my opinion,

02:11.440 --> 02:15.862
he should never be released. He should
never be considered for release.

02:16.114 --> 02:17.604
- He...
- Ms. Lawrence.

02:17.814 --> 02:19.175
Is there a problem?

02:19.714 --> 02:20.714
Excuse me.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.262
Commissioner, members of the board,

02:23.611 --> 02:26.613
mr. Barton would like to withdraw
his application for parole.

02:26.778 --> 02:28.511
- Withdraw?
- Yes, sir...

02:28.568 --> 02:31.080
This is daniel crosby
of the innocence league.

02:31.180 --> 02:34.180
The federal appeals court
has exonerated mr. Barton.

02:34.497 --> 02:36.230
He will be released
by the end of the week.

02:37.557 --> 02:38.957
Uh, what...

02:39.490 --> 02:40.857
What's going on?

02:40.997 --> 02:42.414
It's a new dna test.

02:42.831 --> 02:43.831
Dna?

02:44.177 --> 02:46.410
They've retested the
crime scene evidence.

02:46.477 --> 02:49.289
Apparently, the blood at the scene
under the victim's fingernails

02:49.323 --> 02:51.062
does not belong to mr. Barton.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.360
May I say something?

02:53.567 --> 02:55.684
I'm afraid it's too late, Ms. Mcnally.

02:55.851 --> 02:56.901
There's been a mistake.

02:58.033 --> 03:00.983
Uh...
A mistake?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.756
Looks like you got
the wrong man, Mr. Monk.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
6x08 MR. MONK AND THE WRONG MAN

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
- Synchro by  Â¤ AkaZab Â¤

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
-  www.sub-way.fr

04:14.654 --> 04:17.353
Fourteen years ago,
San Franciso was shocked

04:17.447 --> 04:20.572
by the gruesome double murders
of john and valerie davis,

04:20.721 --> 04:23.389
two local jewelry merchants
who were found tortured and

04:23.456 --> 04:25.981
slain in their quiet
anderson village home.

04:26.047 --> 04:27.726
Everyone considered the case closed

04:27.762 --> 04:31.111
with the conviction of this man,
maxwell g. Barton.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.106
Until last week, when,
in a stunning reversal,

04:34.477 --> 04:35.947
the ninth circuit court of appeals,

04:36.135 --> 04:37.707
citing new dna evidence,

04:37.743 --> 04:40.278
overturned the conviction
and ordered mr. Barton's...

04:40.300 --> 04:41.782
Max, you son of a bitch.

04:41.805 --> 04:43.842
Police department spokesmen
Leland Stottlemeyer

04:43.866 --> 04:46.261
will be holding a news
conference later this afternoon.

04:47.642 --> 04:49.126
So I come out.

04:50.109 --> 04:52.976
"The department deeply regrets... "
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.207
"We are reviewing procedure
to make sure mistakes... "

04:55.223 --> 04:58.322
yak, yak, yak, yak.
Are there any questions?

04:59.751 --> 05:02.216
- Randy, the questions.
- Sorry.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.830
"Captain Stottlemeyer,

05:03.846 --> 05:05.546
- yes
- Max barton plans to sue the state

05:05.576 --> 05:07.600
for wrongful conviction.
Do you have any comment?"

05:07.849 --> 05:10.599
max barton can sue whoever he wants to.

05:10.631 --> 05:14.992
However, we are not at liberty
to comment on any pending litigation.

05:15.047 --> 05:17.147
- How about that?
- That's great. It's wonderful.

05:19.191 --> 05:20.191
You okay?

05:20.795 --> 05:21.795
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.431
Good. Keep going.

05:23.848 --> 05:26.086
"Does the department plan
to dispute the dna evidence?"

05:26.117 --> 05:28.284
nope. In fact, we have tested

05:28.314 --> 05:31.214
the evidence ourselves, independently,
and we agree that

05:31.247 --> 05:34.347
the blood found at the crime scene
does not belong to mr. Barton.

05:35.623 --> 05:36.623
Hey.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.283
Sorry. Um...

05:38.449 --> 05:40.166
"Will you be reopening the case?"

05:40.199 --> 05:42.066
we already have reopened the case.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.281
And, uh, as you know,
there is no statute

05:44.319 --> 05:47.960
of limitations on murder.
However, we. What the hell is going on?

05:49.694 --> 05:50.710
It wasn't me.

05:50.992 --> 05:52.767
- What wasn't you?
- This screwup.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.362
It wasn't me.

05:54.736 --> 05:58.970
It's always me. I can't believe it's not
me. It's always me. This wasn't me.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.750
I wasn't even on the force back then.

06:01.017 --> 06:03.467
You understand that this
wasn't a traffic violation.

06:04.241 --> 06:06.492
An innocent man spent
14 years of his life

06:06.525 --> 06:09.090
in a state penitentiary,
and the son of a bitch

06:09.123 --> 06:11.551
that murdered those poor people
is still out there.

06:11.601 --> 06:14.047
Yes, sir.
I know, but it wasn't me.

06:16.972 --> 06:19.022
You're right, randy.
It wasn't you.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.203
It was Adrian Monk's case.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.024
I just talked to natalie.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.050
Monk is devastated.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.033
I can't blame him.

06:29.743 --> 06:30.827
Can you imagine?

06:31.203 --> 06:32.203
The guilt.

06:32.731 --> 06:33.731
The pain.

06:34.993 --> 06:38.276
Adrian Monk had this much
confidence to begin with...

06:38.309 --> 06:39.893
This'll probably kill him.

06:41.865 --> 06:43.433
What have you got to say to that?

06:44.487 --> 06:45.670
It wasn't me.

06:47.423 --> 06:48.590
I should just quit.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.937
- Quit?
- Why don't I? Just quit.

06:51.088 --> 06:55.005
Now. Today. Never leave the house again.
If I had any decency at all...

06:55.055 --> 06:58.050
I- I won't let you quit, Adrian.
You're too good a detective.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.415
I haven't been sleeping.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.369
Been up all night.

07:01.563 --> 07:05.092
Reviewing my old cases.
How many other mistakes have I made?

07:05.126 --> 07:08.173
What else did I miss?
How many other innocent people

07:08.222 --> 07:11.188
are sitting in some cell
right now because...

07:11.338 --> 07:13.472
Adrian, it was one case.

07:13.814 --> 07:15.281
One case is enough.

07:16.372 --> 07:20.544
I used to think the worst mistake I
could make was letting a killer go free.

07:22.171 --> 07:23.321
But this is worse.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.530
Sending that man to prison...

07:27.713 --> 07:29.580
14 years.

07:29.621 --> 07:33.969
Adrian, what you're feeling here now,
this remorse, this is actually healthy.

07:34.391 --> 07:39.033
You're... No, you're connecting
with another person. This max barton.

07:39.149 --> 07:40.780
What you're feeling is empathy.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.579
It will make you a better detective.

07:42.607 --> 07:44.568
It might even make
you a better human being.

07:44.601 --> 07:46.592
You should've seen him at that hearing.

07:46.963 --> 07:49.323
Staring at me.
He hates me.

07:49.819 --> 07:51.503
At least we have that in common.

07:52.189 --> 07:53.189
He's...

07:54.751 --> 07:57.324
He's being released tomorrow morning.

07:57.682 --> 08:01.660
From the seabrook penitentiary.
It's a 47-minute drive.

08:03.493 --> 08:05.940
I know where you're going with this.

08:06.356 --> 08:08.187
- You do?
- Yes, yes.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.965
And I think it's a great idea.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.096
- Really?
- yeah.

08:11.165 --> 08:14.000
Thank god.
I'm so relieved.

08:14.841 --> 08:16.805
Tell him how sorry I am.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.986
- What is this?
- It's a card.

08:21.019 --> 08:22.918
I wrote a little note on the back.

08:23.016 --> 08:25.007
No, Adrian, I thought
you were going up there.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.040
Me?

08:26.110 --> 08:29.475
I put the man away for 14 years.
He'd crush me like a peanut.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.525
Well, Adrian, I cannot do this for you.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.688
You're right.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.113
Sorry. You're absolutely right.

08:39.856 --> 08:41.230
I don't know what I was thinking.

08:41.298 --> 08:43.580
And natalie can't do it either.

08:51.215 --> 08:52.499
Barton, maxwell.

08:52.530 --> 08:55.027
5122b. Order for release.

08:58.148 --> 08:59.148
Yeah.

09:00.644 --> 09:01.976
Barton, I'm happy for you, man.

09:02.483 --> 09:04.883
Got some personal items for you. Wallet,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.948
belt, and... Just check that and that.

09:11.377 --> 09:14.330
Well, looks like I lost
a little bit of weight.

09:14.997 --> 09:16.481
Yeah, just throw this out.

09:16.679 --> 09:18.824
No, just take the belt, punch a hole.

09:18.947 --> 09:20.781
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

09:23.758 --> 09:24.924
See you around.

09:26.658 --> 09:27.658
Mr. Barton.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.471
It...

09:34.744 --> 09:35.777
It's me.

09:38.885 --> 09:40.502
You... You look great.

09:42.092 --> 09:43.125
Get me out of here.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.233
Max!

10:03.992 --> 10:05.042
Mr. Barton.

10:05.334 --> 10:08.067
I... Just wanted to say sorry.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.880
Sorry.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.871
I'm... I am sorry.
I'm... I'm really sorry.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.508
This is natalie Teeger, my assistant.
Natalie, this...

10:16.554 --> 10:17.851
- This is max.
- Hello.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.705
You know the best thing
about getting sprung?

10:19.745 --> 10:21.095
I don't have to listen to you.

10:21.395 --> 10:24.527
Right. Max, this is for you.
Uh, it's a little...

10:24.574 --> 10:26.097
- Little something.
- Yeah?

10:26.149 --> 10:28.549
Are 14 years of my life in there?

10:28.811 --> 10:31.063
No, just...
Mostly caramels.

10:31.122 --> 10:33.472
- Chocolate pretzel.
- And a chocolate pretzel.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.981
Listen, I-I just wanted to explain
about what happened.

10:37.011 --> 10:41.040
It was an honest mistake.
I mean, look at all the evidence.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.166
The killer used an upholster's knot.
You were an upholsterer.

10:44.195 --> 10:47.795
You had a criminal record.
Your fingerprint was on the doorknob.

10:47.845 --> 10:50.347
I made a delivery there the
week before. I told you that.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.423
But you didn't listen.

10:51.593 --> 10:53.074
There was an eyewitness.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.998
Mrs. Mcnally swore she saw you
leaving the house.

10:57.182 --> 10:59.973
Plus, the killer was left-handed.
I proved that.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.503
- And you're left-handed.
- Yeah, not anymore.

11:03.301 --> 11:05.468
My first week here, they stomped on it.

11:05.658 --> 11:06.658
Why?

11:06.701 --> 11:08.279
Because I looked at a guy, that's why.

11:08.315 --> 11:11.124
I'm against that. Stomping on hands.
I've always been against that.

11:11.155 --> 11:12.605
- Do you need a lift?
- No thanks.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.141
Somebody picking you up?
Your wife?

11:16.345 --> 11:17.428
My wife?

11:17.707 --> 11:18.840
You mean the woman who

11:19.068 --> 11:20.835
stopped visiting me nine years ago?

11:20.865 --> 11:22.980
Who divorced me five years ago?
That who you mean?

11:23.912 --> 11:25.295
You really want to help me, Monk?

11:26.383 --> 11:28.621
Why don't you curl up
in a corner and die?

11:31.073 --> 11:32.556
Well, at least you tried.

11:33.368 --> 11:34.923
I have to do something.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.678
I have to help him.

11:37.722 --> 11:39.539
Mr. Monk, I don't think
he wants your help.

11:39.577 --> 11:40.677
How do you know?

11:40.726 --> 11:43.343
Well, the "curl up and die"
thing was sort of a hint.

11:43.393 --> 11:45.359
I can't just walk away.

11:46.457 --> 11:48.007
I have to make this right.

11:56.259 --> 11:57.259
Hello again.

11:58.163 --> 11:59.163
It's me again.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.386
What do you want?

12:02.002 --> 12:04.859
Just want to start by
reiterating once again how

12:05.150 --> 12:09.250
very, very,
very sorry we both are...

12:09.988 --> 12:10.988
Mostly me...

12:11.260 --> 12:13.123
I'm very sorry.
So, really...

12:13.173 --> 12:14.778
- So sorry.
- Do you live here?

12:14.822 --> 12:17.786
I got a room in the basement.
It's part of their halfway program.

12:17.813 --> 12:19.908
Oh, it's, uh... It's nice.

12:20.576 --> 12:21.707
It's a cesspool.

12:22.281 --> 12:23.724
I'm lucky to get it.

12:23.778 --> 12:25.574
I thought you were suing the state.

12:25.826 --> 12:27.795
Yeah, my lawyer said
that could take years.

12:28.029 --> 12:30.279
Meanwhile, I'm broke and alone.

12:30.419 --> 12:31.419
I'm...

12:31.477 --> 12:33.739
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

12:33.784 --> 12:36.841
Let me... I'll take that.
Let me take that, no problem. I'll just.

12:40.182 --> 12:41.963
- What are you doing here?
- I'm...

12:42.998 --> 12:44.807
Well, I-I wanted to...

12:44.874 --> 12:48.808
We wanted to invite you
to, um...

12:49.176 --> 12:51.744
I'm sorry, is that steven rudner?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.716
- The district attorney?
- That's right.

12:55.643 --> 12:56.859
Is that...

12:57.701 --> 12:58.851
Is that me?

12:59.834 --> 13:00.968
That looks like me.

13:02.212 --> 13:03.212
It is me.

13:03.651 --> 13:05.201
Is that a knife?

13:08.864 --> 13:10.541
Heh.
It looks like...

13:11.303 --> 13:12.386
Looks like you're...

13:12.736 --> 13:13.920
Stabbing me.

13:13.970 --> 13:15.753
Right between the eyes.

13:16.756 --> 13:17.933
Invite me to what?

13:19.036 --> 13:20.626
I don't know if you're hungry.

13:20.784 --> 13:24.100
We, uh, just did some shopping,
and we have plenty of food.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.395
You made me a sandwich, Monk?

13:27.864 --> 13:29.672
You think that's gonna put things right?

13:30.173 --> 13:32.138
We have chips.

13:32.808 --> 13:35.624
Admit it, Monk. You're not here for me,
you're here for yourself.

13:35.653 --> 13:38.661
The pain, the guilt,
it's... It's crushing you. Am I right?

13:39.746 --> 13:43.651
Yeah, you wanna hear those three
magic words, "I forgive you." well...

13:43.965 --> 13:45.735
You want me to give you absolution?

13:46.333 --> 13:47.754
You want me to release you?

13:47.858 --> 13:48.893
Please.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.052
Sorry, detective.

13:51.447 --> 13:52.738
It's not my job.

13:53.385 --> 13:55.555
Why don't you go talk to a priest?

14:02.632 --> 14:03.703
Thank you.

14:11.563 --> 14:13.073
You okay?

14:13.192 --> 14:14.479
I can feel it.

14:14.914 --> 14:17.194
That knife tattoo going into my head.

14:17.796 --> 14:19.032
It's like voodoo.

14:19.073 --> 14:21.500
Mr. Monk, there's no such thing.
It's all in your head.

14:21.540 --> 14:22.548
Oh, yeah?

14:22.901 --> 14:24.603
What... What are you doing?

14:25.237 --> 14:26.324
- I'm hungry.
- What?

14:26.386 --> 14:28.623
I made that sandwich for max.

14:28.704 --> 14:30.537
Mr. Monk, I don't think he's coming.

14:30.586 --> 14:33.781
What if he changes his mind? He'll come
in here, see you eating his sandwich.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.663
He'll never forgive me. ow...

14:35.819 --> 14:38.017
Mr. Monk,
he obviously doesn't want your help,

14:38.080 --> 14:40.684
okay? Let it go.
You did everything you could.

14:40.744 --> 14:41.752
Maybe not.

14:42.183 --> 14:43.617
Look, I have an idea.

14:45.178 --> 14:46.178
He likes you.

14:46.481 --> 14:48.299
- Who likes me?
- Max.

14:48.359 --> 14:50.225
- I could tell.
- So?

14:50.297 --> 14:53.158
So you go back there.
Talk to him.

14:53.946 --> 14:54.946
Why?

14:58.469 --> 15:00.244
I think you should date him.

15:01.277 --> 15:03.690
Mr. Monk. I'm not gonna date him.
I don't even know him.

15:03.714 --> 15:07.016
Okay, okay. It doesn't have to be
a date. Just make out with him.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.326
- All right.
- Really?

15:09.404 --> 15:10.404
- No.
- Come on!

15:10.439 --> 15:11.948
- As a favor to me.
- No.

15:12.073 --> 15:13.194
What would it take?

15:13.212 --> 15:16.380
You're telling me you can't spare
five minutes? You're so busy?

15:16.433 --> 15:18.585
Mr. Monk, I'm kinda choosy
who I make out with.

15:18.616 --> 15:20.380
What?
You made out with a leper.

15:20.395 --> 15:21.513
That's different.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.174
You sent him to prison.
Why don't you make out with him?

15:27.173 --> 15:28.173
No...

15:32.139 --> 15:33.163
He's working out again.

15:35.473 --> 15:37.503
- Hello?
- Ow, ow, ow! Ow.

15:37.582 --> 15:38.811
Oh, my god. where?

15:39.340 --> 15:40.340
Okay.

15:40.771 --> 15:41.779
All right.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.130
We'll be right there.

15:43.458 --> 15:44.529
What?
What is it?

15:44.592 --> 15:47.048
That was the Captain.
Max is in trouble.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.507
Let's go!

15:58.718 --> 16:00.686
It's that guy they just released,
max barton.

16:00.713 --> 16:02.413
- We know.
- He's in there freaking out.

16:02.448 --> 16:04.855
- Something about his ex-wife.
- Wait! What are you doing?

16:04.879 --> 16:05.928
We're taking him in.

16:05.975 --> 16:09.355
No. No, wait. Let me, uh...
Let me talk to him. I can talk to him.

16:09.370 --> 16:10.381
He'll listen to me.

16:10.604 --> 16:13.207
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No. He hates my guts.

16:17.592 --> 16:18.710
Where is she?

16:19.093 --> 16:22.595
You tell me right now and I'll leave
you alone. You'll never see me again.

16:22.713 --> 16:23.713
Max.

16:24.171 --> 16:25.888
Max.
It's me.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.404
And her.
it's us.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.132
How you doing, max?

16:30.305 --> 16:31.549
Get on outta here!

16:31.597 --> 16:32.867
I am not talking to him!

16:32.977 --> 16:34.552
Okay.
It's okay.

16:36.001 --> 16:37.308
What's going on here?

16:37.375 --> 16:39.600
His ex-wife used to work here.

16:39.691 --> 16:41.939
She quit four years ago.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.127
Max...

16:43.679 --> 16:45.360
Max, you're scaring everybody.

16:46.364 --> 16:47.424
I've tried to tell him.

16:47.518 --> 16:49.267
We haven't heard from her.

16:49.359 --> 16:52.583
Except for that one picture
in a christmas card.

16:53.850 --> 16:54.850
Picture...

16:55.902 --> 16:56.911
Max?

16:57.838 --> 16:58.838
Max, can I see it?

17:00.812 --> 17:01.812
Come on.

17:03.752 --> 17:05.114
Give me a chance.

17:08.952 --> 17:09.952
Watch this.

17:13.978 --> 17:14.978
Okay.

17:16.877 --> 17:17.877
She's in a hotel.

17:19.391 --> 17:22.702
Probably a resort near a beach.
There's sand on the bedspread.

17:23.367 --> 17:24.367
A- a resort?

17:24.573 --> 17:25.959
Yeah.
See?

17:26.955 --> 17:29.140
The... The card on the gift basket?

17:29.187 --> 17:30.307
It's in dutch, so...

17:30.917 --> 17:32.185
She's probably in st. Martin.

17:33.164 --> 17:35.309
St. Martin? She was always
talking about that place.

17:35.341 --> 17:37.163
Yeah.
She's not alone.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.320
Two plates on the room service cart.

17:40.270 --> 17:43.924
It's probably a man, because the
toilet seat is up. You can see it in...

17:44.333 --> 17:45.728
In the reflection in the mirror...

17:45.754 --> 17:47.520
A man?!

17:47.819 --> 17:49.513
Okay, did I...
Did I say a man?

17:49.762 --> 17:51.600
Look, I-I could be wrong.

17:51.663 --> 17:56.506
Max, I am not an expert on toilet seats.
Did she stand up when she made water?

17:56.537 --> 17:58.803
- Look, I could be wrong.
- Yeah, he's wrong a lot.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.676
I- I don't have to tell you that.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.384
I'm nothing without her.

18:03.803 --> 18:04.803
Listen to me, max.

18:05.768 --> 18:06.775
Listen to me.

18:07.796 --> 18:11.657
There are two officers outside,
and they are just looking for an excuse

18:11.689 --> 18:14.778
to come in here and lock you up again.
You don't want that.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.304
I don't want that either.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.932
But... But I can't live without her.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.640
I understand.

18:22.752 --> 18:24.170
I'm gonna find her.

18:25.544 --> 18:26.705
I promise.

18:27.451 --> 18:29.029
I'm not gonna quit until I do.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.376
They're reopening the case. So we're
going back to the original crime scene.

18:36.391 --> 18:37.773
They're gonna find the real killer.

18:37.774 --> 18:39.504
After 11 years?
The trail went pretty cold.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.385
No, mr. Monk doesn't need a trail.
He's done it lots of times.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.401
Oh, good.
Go get him.

18:44.464 --> 18:46.014
You nail that son of a bitch.

18:46.069 --> 18:47.477
I won't let you down, max.

18:56.175 --> 18:57.829
You're tracking down his ex-wife?

18:57.923 --> 18:59.608
Yeah, and getting him a job.

18:59.837 --> 19:02.681
Natalie's father's gonna give him some
work on the loading dock there.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.749
Why don't you just adopt
this guy and make it legal?

19:06.174 --> 19:11.166
You don't understand what it's like.
I feel so responsible.

19:11.529 --> 19:13.506
Yeah...
It must be tough.

19:13.628 --> 19:15.493
I mean,
I wasn't involved in the case, but

19:15.561 --> 19:17.896
I can certainly appreciate...
Well, I mean...

19:18.932 --> 19:21.439
I can imagine
what you must be going through.

19:22.731 --> 19:25.550
Why don't you just make a t-shirt
that says, "it wasn't me"?

19:29.325 --> 19:32.446
Mr. Gelbertson? Captain Stottlemeyer.
We spoke on the phone.

19:32.598 --> 19:33.598
Good time?

19:33.910 --> 19:35.134
Not really.

19:35.654 --> 19:36.654
How about now?

19:36.778 --> 19:38.034
Oh. Sure.

19:40.508 --> 19:44.019
Michael, matthew, these men are from
the police.

19:44.747 --> 19:46.144
Are they real police?

19:46.179 --> 19:48.607
Yes, they're gonna take
a look around for a few minutes.

19:48.654 --> 19:49.688
Why?

19:49.801 --> 19:54.163
Oh, well, because a long time ago,
before I was on the force,

19:54.188 --> 19:55.924
something happened in this house.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.256
Was it scary?

19:57.679 --> 19:59.808
I don't know.
I wasn't here.

19:59.902 --> 20:01.703
It was before my time.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.619
What's he doing?

20:05.046 --> 20:07.296
Him? He's a detective.
Like on tv.

20:07.327 --> 20:11.515
Oh, we don't let the boys
watch television. It's too violent.

20:11.913 --> 20:15.313
Well, yeah, I can't blame you.
I got two boys myself.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.532
The realtor did mention something

20:18.548 --> 20:20.706
when we bought the house...
Something about a robbery?

20:20.741 --> 20:23.045
It's a home invasion.
Double homicide.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.889
Husband and wife.
Tortured. Then killed.

20:26.879 --> 20:28.232
Were they drug dealers?

20:28.279 --> 20:30.631
No. They were a nice couple.
About your age.

20:30.756 --> 20:34.580
They sold jewelry. They had a wall safe.
It was loaded with merchandise.

20:34.605 --> 20:36.002
That's what the guy was after.

20:36.076 --> 20:39.282
- I thought you caught him.
- Yeah, so did we.

20:39.439 --> 20:43.283
It turns out we had the wrong guy.
So, um, we've reopened the case.

20:43.716 --> 20:47.007
Well, what can you find now?
I mean, after 12 years?

20:47.104 --> 20:48.769
Actually, 14 years.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.976
I've only been on the force for 9.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.418
It was 5 years before that.
So it's 14 years.

20:53.484 --> 20:58.599
The wall safe was here.
We found bloody footprints over there.

20:58.631 --> 21:02.118
There was a whole trail
of blood all the way through here.

21:02.642 --> 21:05.011
Splattered all over.

21:05.753 --> 21:08.469
I remember we found a piece
of the thumb over there.

21:08.918 --> 21:12.472
The wife broke free.
She crawled across the playroom...

21:13.921 --> 21:15.622
Out over the patio.

21:17.170 --> 21:18.962
Yeah. Yeah, he killed her out there.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.143
Right where your sandbox is.
Do you guys play outside?

21:23.422 --> 21:26.039
You ever found anything
unusual out there?

21:26.707 --> 21:27.853
Like what?

21:28.383 --> 21:31.738
9- millimeter shell casing,
bone fragments...

21:32.345 --> 21:33.537
No? Nothing like that?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.091
Hacksaw blade?

21:35.489 --> 21:36.489
No.

21:46.285 --> 21:47.308
What do you got?

21:47.943 --> 21:49.378
Scratch marks.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.477
From a dog.

21:51.003 --> 21:52.517
They were there when we moved in.

21:53.872 --> 21:55.692
No.
Can't be.

21:56.618 --> 21:59.534
I don't remember a dog 14 years ago.

21:59.662 --> 22:01.003
Well, according to this,

22:01.172 --> 22:04.449
the victims did have a dog.
It died the day before the murder.

22:04.669 --> 22:06.951
The day before?
What are the odds of that?

22:07.074 --> 22:09.819
Yeah, well...
They buried it out there.

22:10.409 --> 22:11.460
Under a pine tree.

22:11.584 --> 22:12.812
Well, let's go find it.

22:13.715 --> 22:16.582
We'll dig it up.
There's gotta be enough hair, skin,

22:16.650 --> 22:19.442
skeletal remains.
Enough to test for poison.

22:20.079 --> 22:21.710
You boys wanna help dig a hole?

22:38.389 --> 22:41.299
- Max?
- Hello, pauly.

22:42.389 --> 22:43.907
I heard you was out.

22:44.853 --> 22:46.191
I was gonna call you.

22:46.576 --> 22:47.590
Yeah, sure you were.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.941
I understand, brother.
You're a taxpayer now.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.574
Gotta keep your distance.

22:53.029 --> 22:54.029
So, um...

22:55.520 --> 22:56.587
How you doin'?

22:57.553 --> 22:58.909
How you think I'm doin'?

22:59.641 --> 23:01.595
I felt terrible, max.

23:02.013 --> 23:03.486
But it wasn't my fault, huh?

23:04.073 --> 23:05.734
I mean, it was just bad luck.

23:05.996 --> 23:08.863
The safe being empty, and...
And you getting nailed like that.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.251
You want a drink?

23:10.326 --> 23:11.491
Sure you do.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.992
I got some of that nice
imported stuff you like so much.

23:20.736 --> 23:23.271
- Been lookin' for you, pauly.
- Don't worry about me, bro.

23:23.729 --> 23:25.834
After all those jobs we pulled together?

23:26.779 --> 23:29.202
It's those other jobs I'm worried about.

23:56.327 --> 23:57.551
Sorry, pauly.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.675
I ain't never going back.

24:06.134 --> 24:07.134
Hey.

24:08.378 --> 24:10.737
Toxicology report on the davis's dog.

24:12.415 --> 24:13.422
Poisoned?

24:13.528 --> 24:14.666
Yes, he was.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.526
Doberman pinscher 85 pounds. I guess the
killer didn't want to have him around.

24:18.552 --> 24:19.560
With penzedrine?

24:19.577 --> 24:21.245
Yeah they use it
during heart operations.

24:21.271 --> 24:23.391
It's very rare,
which is good news for us.

24:23.454 --> 24:26.350
I need you go to back 14 years.
I want you to compile a list

24:26.377 --> 24:29.520
of anyone who had access.
That's, uh, medical supply.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.151
- Pharmaceutical companies.
- 14 years?

24:31.166 --> 24:34.046
looking for somebody with a rap sheet.
Somebody who might've missed work

24:34.060 --> 24:35.060
the day of the murders.

24:36.397 --> 24:37.527
Wasn't my case.

24:37.635 --> 24:40.548
Excuse me. What did...
Did you just say it wasn't your case?

24:41.197 --> 24:42.197
No, sir.

24:42.450 --> 24:44.263
I said, "your cousin has a face."

24:45.424 --> 24:46.731
just get me the names.

24:48.861 --> 24:50.121
My cousin has a face.

25:01.493 --> 25:03.780
Max?
Max? Hey.

25:04.414 --> 25:05.414
Hey, how you doing?

25:06.349 --> 25:07.349
Here.

25:10.279 --> 25:11.330
A comic book, huh?

25:11.965 --> 25:13.477
- Great.
- Not gonna help you.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.468
Well, here's the thing.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.793
The foreman called natalie's father.
And, uh...

25:19.228 --> 25:21.055
He said that you haven't been...

25:21.240 --> 25:23.288
You know,
working.

25:23.508 --> 25:24.508
Or anything.

25:24.570 --> 25:25.881
I know it's your first day...

25:25.910 --> 25:26.916
My back hurts.

25:27.377 --> 25:28.377
Your back?

25:28.439 --> 25:29.439
Is, uh...

25:30.542 --> 25:32.729
You told the foreman you had a headache.

25:33.929 --> 25:34.929
It's my back.

25:36.627 --> 25:38.848
I think it happened when I got
the crap beat out of me.

25:39.895 --> 25:40.919
in prison.

25:42.915 --> 25:45.681
Maybe I could talk to someone.
Maybe there's a clerical position...

25:45.735 --> 25:46.869
I'm fine.

25:46.971 --> 25:48.881
Look, did you take care
of that parking ticket?

25:48.960 --> 25:51.300
Yes, I did that.
No problem.

25:51.347 --> 25:54.063
- Talk to the bank?
- Yes, I talked to the loan officer.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.322
He said you're going to need
someone to cosign those papers.

25:57.859 --> 25:58.868
Which...

25:58.883 --> 26:01.213
Of course, I would be
more than happy to do.

26:02.371 --> 26:05.066
Barton! I don't care whose friend
of a friend you are.

26:05.101 --> 26:08.444
I want that pallet on that truck
in ten minutes or you're fired!

26:09.186 --> 26:10.887
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

26:10.950 --> 26:12.304
He sounds pretty mad.

26:12.545 --> 26:13.710
You better get started.

26:28.426 --> 26:30.529
Mr. Monk! What are you doing?

26:30.873 --> 26:32.745
Helping max. Shh, shh, shh.

26:33.772 --> 26:36.402
- I found her. I found max's wife.
-  You found her?

26:36.491 --> 26:38.897
Yeah. She's been living with
her sister in oakland.

26:38.929 --> 26:39.956
Oh, thank god.

26:40.448 --> 26:43.389
This is great. It's gonna make
all the difference. I just...

26:43.452 --> 26:45.532
- Max, we found your wife!
- No, no, wait, mr. Monk!

26:45.565 --> 26:46.993
Sherry?
You found her?

26:47.024 --> 26:49.562
- Well, natalie found her.
- Well, it's not that easy.

26:50.165 --> 26:51.185
Where is she?

26:51.305 --> 26:52.305
Here's the thing.

26:52.367 --> 26:54.321
There's just a little problem.

26:55.825 --> 26:57.966
Sherry,
justin.

26:58.251 --> 27:01.855
The rings that you are about
to receive are perfect circles.

27:02.226 --> 27:04.800
They are symbols
of the sun and the moon,

27:04.973 --> 27:07.772
of peace, and of true faith.

27:08.155 --> 27:10.982
May they always remind you
of the commitment

27:11.029 --> 27:13.834
and the love that you
are sharing on this day.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.833
Marriage...

27:16.342 --> 27:17.901
Marriage is an act

27:17.994 --> 27:19.672
as ancient sherry!

27:19.829 --> 27:21.294
As the history of the...

27:21.571 --> 27:25.083
Sherry!
Sherry!

27:26.243 --> 27:28.338
Sherry!

27:28.822 --> 27:29.830
Thank you.

27:29.996 --> 27:30.996
Thank you.

27:31.443 --> 27:32.561
Thank you. Sorry.

27:32.678 --> 27:34.364
Hello.
I'm so sorry.

27:36.047 --> 27:37.152
Do you know this guy?

27:37.233 --> 27:39.668
He's a cop. He worked on max's case.

27:39.841 --> 27:41.463
What do you want, mr. Monk?

27:41.601 --> 27:42.668
First off, congratulations.

27:43.602 --> 27:45.618
You look radiant.

27:47.154 --> 27:48.154
I know this is...

27:48.847 --> 27:50.525
A bad time.
Here's the thing...

27:50.718 --> 27:52.120
14 years ago,

27:52.645 --> 27:54.405
I madea terrible mistake.

27:54.894 --> 27:57.548
The biggest mistake of my life.
Sherry...

27:59.011 --> 28:01.784
Max barton is an innocent man.

28:02.755 --> 28:04.273
If I hadn't screwed up,

28:05.377 --> 28:07.061
you two would still be together.

28:07.122 --> 28:09.833
We know the whole story.
We've been reading about it.

28:09.868 --> 28:12.668
No, you don't know the story.

28:12.683 --> 28:16.274
The real story
is about a man

28:16.733 --> 28:18.036
who never gave up.

28:25.783 --> 28:27.951
put yourself in his place.

28:28.715 --> 28:30.266
Falsely accused.

28:31.146 --> 28:32.701
Unjustly convicted.

28:34.081 --> 28:35.869
Spending 14 years...

28:35.932 --> 28:39.119
14 horrible, lonely years...

28:39.259 --> 28:40.259
In that...

28:41.821 --> 28:42.821
That...

28:43.558 --> 28:47.633
I'm gonna say it. hell.
I sent that man to hell.

28:49.617 --> 28:52.028
You know how he survived, sherry?

28:52.987 --> 28:54.460
You know what sustained him?

28:55.698 --> 28:56.698
You.

28:57.355 --> 28:59.625
Even after you stopped coming to visit.

28:59.914 --> 29:01.658
Memories of you.

29:02.159 --> 29:03.667
Dreams of you.

29:03.719 --> 29:05.403
Can we do this later?

29:05.432 --> 29:06.926
Later is too late.

29:08.588 --> 29:11.424
Sherry, don't make
the same mistake I did.

29:13.330 --> 29:14.817
Don't lock him away.

29:15.326 --> 29:16.326
Again.

29:16.821 --> 29:17.923
Sherry!

29:22.059 --> 29:24.009
I want you to look at this man.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.656
Look into his eyes.

29:27.502 --> 29:28.805
This...

29:29.309 --> 29:34.104
Is a good,
good, good man.

29:36.865 --> 29:37.865
I...

29:42.470 --> 29:43.676
I don't know.

29:44.530 --> 29:45.582
I think you do know.

29:46.463 --> 29:49.121
If you have any feelings for him at all,

29:49.522 --> 29:52.039
don't you owe it to yourself
to stop, take a day,

29:52.205 --> 29:54.091
take a week, look into your heart?

29:57.114 --> 29:58.138
Max.

29:58.882 --> 29:59.882
Show her.

30:08.867 --> 30:09.918
That's you.

30:12.004 --> 30:13.383
The dragon?
No.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.864
No, Next to the dragon.
Inside...

30:16.293 --> 30:17.391
That's a man.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.343
No, that's the district attorney. Across
from the man, inside the broken heart.

30:22.283 --> 30:23.822
What does it say?

30:23.907 --> 30:26.207
"Sherry...
My love...

30:26.963 --> 30:27.963
My life."

30:36.579 --> 30:37.839
Oh, max.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.911
Baby!

30:49.267 --> 30:50.857
Well,
you did it.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.235
You happy?

30:53.483 --> 30:54.491
Eh...

30:54.854 --> 30:56.730
- Why not?
- I don't know.

30:57.103 --> 30:58.905
Something...
I don't know.

30:59.777 --> 31:01.149
I hate you.

31:01.464 --> 31:02.531
Join the club.

31:04.086 --> 31:05.724
How could you?

31:05.869 --> 31:07.286
What are you doing here?

31:07.399 --> 31:10.862
This is sarah mcnally.
She was the eyewitness 14 years ago.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.155
I've been following you.

31:12.451 --> 31:13.451
Watching you.

31:13.889 --> 31:15.152
You've been helping him.

31:15.196 --> 31:19.011
No... Max barton has been exonerated.
The police found some evidence...

31:19.043 --> 31:20.835
I don't care about any new evidence.

31:21.126 --> 31:22.429
I know what I saw.

31:22.623 --> 31:25.442
I saw him leaving that house.
He's a monster.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.981
Ma'am, a lot of people were wrong
about this case. It's not your fault.

31:29.043 --> 31:33.027
You were in your house.
You were 45, maybe 50 yards away...

31:33.060 --> 31:34.619
42 yards.

31:35.042 --> 31:36.419
You measured, remember?

31:36.600 --> 31:39.492
Your measuring tape broke. You sent
Lieutenant culkin to get a new one.

31:39.832 --> 31:43.212
Culkin.
You... You remember his name?

31:43.714 --> 31:45.032
I remember everything.

31:45.525 --> 31:46.671
It's a curse.

31:47.396 --> 31:49.183
You were wearing the exact same thing.

31:49.431 --> 31:51.991
Except it was a gray blazer
with white buttons.

31:52.825 --> 31:55.032
That's right.
She's right.

31:55.878 --> 31:56.945
Ask me anything.

31:57.254 --> 31:59.517
Lieutenant culkin's 3241.

31:59.969 --> 32:02.032
You were driving a white chevrolet

32:02.142 --> 32:04.441
with one of those green air fresheners.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.859
Photographic memory.

32:06.159 --> 32:08.868
Like I said, I know what I saw.

32:09.435 --> 32:10.738
I heard screaming.

32:10.922 --> 32:12.215
I went to the window.

32:12.819 --> 32:14.169
And I saw him.

32:14.770 --> 32:16.042
Max barton.

32:16.253 --> 32:17.623
Leaving that house.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.381
I will never forget it.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.673
How he walked down the street,

32:22.764 --> 32:24.187
his hands in his pocket,

32:24.266 --> 32:26.152
like he didn't have a care in the world.

32:26.183 --> 32:27.853
His hands were in his pockets?

32:28.574 --> 32:29.629
What, what, what, what?

32:30.151 --> 32:32.498
The killer used an acetylene torch

32:32.529 --> 32:33.788
to break into the safe.

32:34.113 --> 32:35.385
We never found it.

32:36.876 --> 32:40.105
If the man you saw
wasn't carrying anything...

32:40.435 --> 32:43.119
- There was a second man.
- An accomplice.

32:43.568 --> 32:46.654
An accomplice...
That's whose dna they found.

32:47.348 --> 32:49.647
I was right the first time.

32:50.913 --> 32:52.189
He was there.

32:52.672 --> 32:54.327
I never figured on a second man.

32:54.365 --> 32:56.003
Let's call the Captain.
It's too late.

32:56.037 --> 32:59.223
He's been exonerated.
It's called double jeopardy.

32:59.758 --> 33:02.105
You can't try a man twice
for the same crime.

33:02.882 --> 33:06.307
Wait... Wait, that's it?
He gets away with murder?

33:15.429 --> 33:17.461
E we get the other one back?

33:18.137 --> 33:19.220
The usual?

33:19.753 --> 33:20.824
Captain? okay.

33:21.438 --> 33:22.777
Thank you.

33:23.869 --> 33:27.918
The blood type matches. I'm sure the dna
does too. He is definitely the guy.

33:27.967 --> 33:29.165
Well, the other guy.

33:29.244 --> 33:30.836
Thank you, randy.
The other guy.

33:30.899 --> 33:33.415
- Who was he?
- His name was pauly flores.

33:33.450 --> 33:35.353
He and barton were pals,
high school buddies.

33:35.407 --> 33:37.603
We found him this morning
hanging from this door

33:37.958 --> 33:39.167
by his own belt.

33:39.323 --> 33:42.149
- Suicide?
- Yep, what they call prison style.

33:42.809 --> 33:45.865
I guess he freaked out when he heard
that his pal had been released.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.090
Guilt, flashbacks...
I guess we'll never know.

33:48.253 --> 33:50.093
And he had access to that drug?

33:50.246 --> 33:52.250
Penzedrine.
That's affirmative.

33:52.296 --> 33:55.855
He worked as a security guard at
lavallee pharmaceuticals for 15 years.

33:55.888 --> 33:56.991
That's how we found him.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.953
Computer spit out his name this morning.

33:59.016 --> 34:01.457
You know, we figure he and
barton were in on it together.

34:01.886 --> 34:04.506
They poisoned the family dog,
broke in the next day.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.969
Looks like you were
right the first time.

34:08.016 --> 34:09.024
Half right.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.647
Didn't know about him.

34:14.270 --> 34:16.348
I spoke to the d.A.'S office.

34:17.297 --> 34:20.197
They said there's nothing they can do.
Double jeopardy.

34:20.518 --> 34:21.858
They've closed the case.

34:23.321 --> 34:24.487
He's gonna walk.

34:25.141 --> 34:26.559
Can you live with that?

34:29.313 --> 34:30.322
Could you?

34:34.882 --> 34:36.158
Wait...

34:38.152 --> 34:39.790
- Wait.
- what?

34:41.217 --> 34:42.239
We got him.

34:42.378 --> 34:44.495
- We got who?
- Barton. Max barton.

34:45.014 --> 34:46.877
- We can nail him.
- No, it's double jeopardy.

34:46.891 --> 34:49.793
You can't... Not for the first thing.
For this.

34:52.496 --> 34:53.925
We got him on this.

34:54.616 --> 34:56.045
Can we prove it?

34:56.521 --> 34:57.854
I think so.

34:59.144 --> 35:01.457
- Randy, find him.
- I know where he is.

35:01.536 --> 35:03.788
He told a couple of guys
in my dad's loading dock.

35:03.847 --> 35:06.216
- Well, let's pick him up.
- Where is he?

35:06.692 --> 35:07.873
You're not gonna believe it.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.730
As some of you may rember,

35:12.762 --> 35:18.424
the rings that sherry and
max are about to receive

35:18.471 --> 35:22.345
are perfect circles,
symbols of the sun and the moon,

35:23.124 --> 35:24.931
peace, and, um...

35:25.534 --> 35:26.652
True faith.

35:27.115 --> 35:28.265
True faith.

35:28.811 --> 35:29.882
Max.

35:30.234 --> 35:31.242
Sherry.

35:31.616 --> 35:34.779
Marriage is an act as ancient

35:34.811 --> 35:37.686
as the history of the human race.

35:37.793 --> 35:40.564
Help me, lord, it's the same guy.

35:41.107 --> 35:42.367
Sherry!

35:45.138 --> 35:46.351
Thank you again.

35:46.713 --> 35:49.186
Excuse me.
Sorry. Hello again.

35:49.335 --> 35:51.457
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry! Sorry.

35:51.939 --> 35:54.207
This... This'll only take a minute.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.185
What do you want, Monk?

35:57.233 --> 35:58.921
Sherry, you can't marry this man.

35:59.640 --> 36:04.181
No, he is a very, very dangerous man.
He's killed three people.

36:04.256 --> 36:05.559
That we know of.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.905
- But you said...
- I know.

36:08.691 --> 36:12.918
I know, but this time, I'm positive.
I want you to look at this man.

36:12.969 --> 36:15.438
Look into his eyes.

36:15.552 --> 36:19.504
This is a bad, bad, bad man.

36:20.167 --> 36:22.073
Sherry, I made a mistake,

36:22.152 --> 36:24.845
and then I compounded the mistake.

36:26.158 --> 36:27.246
Don't you make

36:27.891 --> 36:31.214
the same mistake
by compounding...

36:31.797 --> 36:32.797
My other...

36:33.205 --> 36:34.285
Mistake...
My first...

36:34.333 --> 36:37.230
Sherry, they were right
about max 14 years ago.

36:37.688 --> 36:41.768
What we didn't know is he had an
accomplice named pauly flores.

36:41.862 --> 36:44.784
It was pauly's dna we
found at the crime scene.

36:45.207 --> 36:46.207
Pauly.

36:46.594 --> 36:47.803
I remember him.

36:48.043 --> 36:49.734
I haven't seen that guy
since high school!

36:49.792 --> 36:51.248
I swear to god. Anybody got a bible?

36:51.284 --> 36:52.519
Did he confess?

36:52.888 --> 36:53.888
Pauly's dead.

36:54.137 --> 36:55.910
We found him this morning
in his apartment,

36:56.010 --> 36:57.119
hanging from a belt.

36:57.441 --> 36:58.441
Sherry.

36:59.410 --> 37:01.788
Baby.
This is our day.

37:02.247 --> 37:03.314
Our moment.

37:03.994 --> 37:07.112
If pauly decided to hang himself with
his own belt, well, that's his problem.

37:07.210 --> 37:09.431
Actually, max,
he didn't use his own belt.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.295
Lieutenant?

37:13.405 --> 37:14.845
This is the belt we found.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.710
This is your belt, isn't it, max?

37:18.283 --> 37:20.440
I was there when you
were being released.

37:21.841 --> 37:23.946
You said you'd lost some weight, rember?

37:24.337 --> 37:26.634
That you needed to punch
another hole into it.

37:26.728 --> 37:27.874
What does that prove?

37:28.516 --> 37:30.726
A lot of people punch holes
in their belt.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.561
Nobody's gonna believe you anyway, Monk.

37:33.820 --> 37:34.872
Not after last time.

37:35.257 --> 37:37.438
This guy is still out to get me.

37:37.877 --> 37:40.126
I mean, he's obsessed
or something, I-I...

37:40.772 --> 37:44.450
You're right, max, there's no way
we can prove that this is your belt.

37:45.426 --> 37:48.934
But we can prove that the belt you're
wearing belonged to pauly flores.

37:48.981 --> 37:50.563
The man you killed.

37:52.746 --> 37:55.091
You strangled him with your own belt.

37:55.967 --> 37:58.705
You hang him from the door
to make it look like suicide.

38:00.027 --> 38:03.082
But then...
you made a mistake.

38:05.911 --> 38:07.407
Where's pauly's belt?

38:07.961 --> 38:09.205
Because we can't find it.

38:09.253 --> 38:12.436
It's not in his apartment,
and we just checked your room.

38:12.572 --> 38:14.367
What are you talking about?
A belt's a belt.

38:14.405 --> 38:16.248
You can't prove any of this anyway.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.688
Well, we caught a little bit
of a break there, mr. Barton.

38:18.785 --> 38:21.131
Pauly's belt's part of his uniform.
It's company issue.

38:21.422 --> 38:23.493
Their logo's stamped on the inside.

38:24.112 --> 38:25.337
Sir, remove your belt.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.069
What are you, crazy?
I'm not taking off this belt.

38:29.233 --> 38:30.872
Can you believe this?

38:31.532 --> 38:33.374
Take off the belt, max.

38:41.127 --> 38:44.242
Max barton, you're under arrest
for the murder of paul flores.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.270
We all make mistakes, max.

38:47.517 --> 38:49.029
Just means you're human.

38:58.373 --> 38:59.652
Justin!

39:16.416 --> 39:17.581
Randy.

39:18.966 --> 39:21.676
- Yes, sir?
- That was judge heller's office.

39:21.897 --> 39:23.455
She's not giving us a search warrant

39:23.482 --> 39:27.106
on that chinatown thing. She said
she never got the coroner's report.

39:28.698 --> 39:30.696
Oh. That, uh...

39:30.757 --> 39:32.080
I'm sorry.
It's my bad.

39:32.191 --> 39:35.144
I brought it... I brought it home
last night, and I was gonna...

39:35.880 --> 39:37.526
I forgot. I forgot.
I'm gonna go get it.

39:37.587 --> 39:38.594
You're too late.

39:39.153 --> 39:42.334
She's gone.
She's gone on vacation for two weeks.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.172
What?
Aw...

39:46.170 --> 39:47.300
Captain, I'm sorry.

39:47.514 --> 39:49.863
If there's anything I can do.
I'm gonna call the coroner.

39:49.898 --> 39:51.601
- We can get a hold.
- Just to be clear,

39:52.170 --> 39:54.926
this was you.
You screwed this up.

39:55.717 --> 39:57.719
Yes, sir, and I feel terrible about it.

39:58.034 --> 39:59.151
Wasn't me.

39:59.274 --> 40:00.274
Wasn't Monk.

40:02.618 --> 40:05.264
- Wasn't you and it wasn't Monk.
- It was...

40:07.637 --> 40:08.637
It was me.

40:09.086 --> 40:10.172
It was you.

40:11.666 --> 40:13.500
I promise it won't happen again.

40:18.056 --> 40:20.582
God's in his heaven,
all's right with the world.
