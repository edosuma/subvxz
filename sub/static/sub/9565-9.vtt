00:04.200 --> 00:06.200
{\a3}And I'm gonna make a choice. I am.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.200
{\a3}When?

00:07.320 --> 00:08.470
{\a3}Soon. Honest.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.640
{\a3}- I've got something to tell you.
- Me too. I got you a present.

00:19.526 --> 00:20.799
{\a3}He fell on the floor, Jal.

00:21.364 --> 00:23.159
{\a3}There was blood in his ear.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.959
{\a3}I didn't know what to do.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.320
{\a3}<i>I love you too.</i>

00:29.134 --> 00:30.284
{\a3}It's a secret.

00:30.559 --> 00:31.809
{\a3}Don't tell Jal.

00:32.589 --> 00:35.199
{\a3}You said you knew about it
because of the hereditary aspect.

00:35.790 --> 00:36.840
{\a3}The brother.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.250
{\a3}The brother
died of the same thing.

CASSIE

01:33.040 --> 01:35.414
"I know I was all right
on Friday when I got up.

01:35.534 --> 01:37.842
"If anything I was feeling
more stolid than usual.

01:37.962 --> 01:40.011
"When I went out to the kitchen
to get breakfast

01:40.131 --> 01:41.863
"Ainsley was there, moping.

01:41.983 --> 01:44.902
"She said she had been to
a bad party the night before.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.847
"After the first minute I was
surprised to find my feet moving,

01:47.967 --> 01:49.877
"wondering how they had begun.

01:49.997 --> 01:51.434
"But I didn't stop.

01:51.554 --> 01:54.004
"The rest of them were so
astonished...

01:55.000 --> 01:56.631
<i>Hello? No, he doesn't
like grapes.</i>

01:56.751 --> 01:58.994
For fuck's sake,
don't neck them all, you tit.

01:59.114 --> 02:00.764
Pass me a grape, Anwar.

02:03.136 --> 02:05.317
Hey, mate. Do you want some spliff?

02:05.437 --> 02:08.887
"'I think I ought to tell you
something', she said softly.

02:09.717 --> 02:12.867
"His dark eyes opened and
looked up at her vacantly.

02:16.117 --> 02:18.467
"'That's your problem then',
he said.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.327
"'At last I know
what I really want to be.

02:30.137 --> 02:32.417
"She pulled her face
away and gazed down at him.

02:32.537 --> 02:35.457
"His eyes were closed. He was
gazing serenely at the ceiling.

02:35.577 --> 02:37.627
"I took a quick drink of water.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.657
"I couldn't imagine Ainsley
making a miscalculation.

02:40.777 --> 02:43.457
"Being a person is too complicated.
I don't believe you.

02:43.832 --> 02:45.540
"She wasn't smiling.

02:45.914 --> 02:48.057
"'Why are you
so interested in me, Miss?

02:48.177 --> 02:49.827
"'Oh, they're immortal',

02:50.267 --> 02:51.617
"she said quietly.

02:53.437 --> 02:54.987
"'It's only a cake.'"

03:17.991 --> 03:19.041
Where's Jal?

03:20.997 --> 03:22.447
She was here, Chris.

03:22.637 --> 03:23.637
Yeah? When?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.287
You were sleepy.

03:26.357 --> 03:27.357
Yeah?

03:30.427 --> 03:32.477
Hey, what happened to my grapes?

03:32.597 --> 03:33.847
Anwar ate them.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.668
Yeah, well, he's a bloody grapist.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.390
Feels funny, this.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.280
Funny?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.717
Yeah, Cass. I think
you'd feel quite funny

03:46.837 --> 03:49.837
if they'd stuck a tube up
from your balls to your brain.

03:50.424 --> 03:52.587
Jal knows how to change the, um...

03:52.857 --> 03:53.760
thing.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.798
She went to her call-back
at music college.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.120
Right.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.107
I didn't watch, did I,
when they were doing it.

04:05.534 --> 04:08.167
Maybe you should have
stayed in hospital, Chris.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.590
Nah, bollocks.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.440
Had to get home, didn't I?

04:13.977 --> 04:16.173
Chris, are you allowed spliff?

04:18.512 --> 04:20.399
Allowed?
What are you talking about?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.867
- You were dead.
- Mmm. Yup.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.059
Properly dead. Three minutes.

04:25.179 --> 04:27.760
If you can survive that,
a couple of doobies can't hurt.

04:31.323 --> 04:32.940
You want me to take a look?

04:33.227 --> 04:36.320
Cassie, I've got a hole
right by my balls.

04:38.942 --> 04:40.690
Well, an extra hole...

04:42.181 --> 04:44.900
I've seen your balls so many times
I've lost count.

04:45.506 --> 04:47.767
- Like when?
- Like when you were using them

04:47.887 --> 04:50.040
to impersonate Mick Hucknall
from Simply Red.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.240
You've gotta admit, that
resemblance is uncanny.

04:54.975 --> 04:56.000
Come on.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.310
Let me look.

05:00.381 --> 05:01.840
We'll fix you up in no time.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.783
Boxers, Chris.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.540
Looks fine.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.330
Of course, but, er...

05:19.269 --> 05:20.819
what about the wound?

05:28.591 --> 05:31.270
Tell me about Jal
at the hospital again.

05:32.677 --> 05:35.697
She sat beside you the whole time.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.134
The whole time. Never left me.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.598
She never left you.

05:39.718 --> 05:41.571
What, not even to go for a wazz?

05:41.691 --> 05:43.998
No, Chris. She had to go for a waz.

05:44.415 --> 05:45.360
Yeah.

05:48.339 --> 05:49.679
Yeah, she loves me.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.360
Yup.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.040
Love conquers all,
do you know that?

05:54.160 --> 05:57.774
I bet it even conquers a genetically
acquired subarachnoid haemorrhage.

05:58.552 --> 06:00.201
That would be good.

06:01.434 --> 06:02.890
I should have told her.

06:04.370 --> 06:08.150
When my brother died they said
that forewarned was forearmed.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.035
If I got into trouble
they could fix it.

06:13.527 --> 06:15.871
So why didn't you tell anyone?

06:15.991 --> 06:18.040
- I told you didn't I?
- Jal, Chris.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.996
Well, I took blood pressure pills.
They said that'd stop it.

06:21.116 --> 06:24.040
- You took lots of other pills too.
- I like pills, OK?

06:24.481 --> 06:26.276
Never thought it would
actually happen.

06:26.396 --> 06:28.800
There's lots of things
you never think will happen.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.999
Like that, Chris!

06:35.899 --> 06:37.668
Hello, old friend...

06:37.988 --> 06:40.568
It's all right. I'm glad it... works.

06:43.773 --> 06:45.370
Goodbye, old friend.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.476
Um, do we...
Do we tell Jal about the...

06:52.960 --> 06:55.279
about the donger?
Or is that a secret?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.110
You shouldn't have secrets, Chris.

06:58.315 --> 07:00.658
- Neither of you should.
- Right.

07:00.778 --> 07:02.790
Because we love each other.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.130
Because you love each other.

07:28.840 --> 07:29.840
Sleeping.

07:36.266 --> 07:39.391
You're not ill and
hiding it from me, are you, Sid?

07:40.014 --> 07:41.014
No.

07:41.425 --> 07:43.601
I'm stupid and hiding it from you.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.332
Do you mind?

07:45.848 --> 07:46.903
No.

07:55.695 --> 07:57.925
Also I've got a nasty boil on my bum

07:58.045 --> 08:00.118
and I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

08:03.973 --> 08:05.094
Too late.

08:08.716 --> 08:10.200
That's not nice.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.380
No.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.160
Going to my exam.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.270
Is Jal here?

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
No.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.840
Who's looking after Chris?

08:20.542 --> 08:21.685
You are.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.580
Right.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.463
What do I do?

08:25.583 --> 08:27.540
Oh, just change his dressing.

08:28.125 --> 08:31.779
He's still a bit confused so he'll
probably think that I already

08:31.899 --> 08:34.360
changed it today,
but just ignore that.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.330
Right. Where is this dressing?

08:37.450 --> 08:40.839
Oh, he'll show you. Don't let him do
it himself, no matter what he says.

08:41.325 --> 08:43.145
It's much better if somebody else...

08:43.265 --> 08:44.378
handles it.

08:44.820 --> 08:45.820
All right.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.520
OK. What do you have to say to me?

08:51.315 --> 08:53.880
Um... I'm sorry I'm such a tit?

08:54.060 --> 08:54.919
No.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.359
My life never made sense to me
until I met you.

08:57.540 --> 08:58.399
No.

09:02.076 --> 09:04.755
I never really loved Michelle
and it was all a terrible mistake

09:04.875 --> 09:07.764
and I must have misheard her when
she said that I was the best lay ever

09:07.884 --> 09:09.920
and she really, really
wasn't that great in bed.

09:11.079 --> 09:12.079
No.

09:15.324 --> 09:16.719
Good luck in your exam.

09:21.273 --> 09:22.440
Thanks.

09:26.523 --> 09:28.361
What do you have to say to me?

09:30.889 --> 09:32.739
I'll love you forever, Sid.

09:34.122 --> 09:35.239
You will?

09:35.620 --> 09:36.620
Yes.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.790
That's the problem.

09:47.139 --> 09:49.006
You may turn over your papers.

10:37.060 --> 10:37.919
Chris?

10:47.648 --> 10:49.420
- You all right, Sid?
- Yeah.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.460
Yeah. I thought you were...

10:53.700 --> 10:55.260
I gotta change your dressing.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.930
Oh, no. It's fine.
Cassie did it earlier.

11:01.355 --> 11:02.710
Course she has.

11:05.100 --> 11:05.959
Sid?

11:06.654 --> 11:10.079
- Yeah, just let me handle it.
- No fucking way. I'll smack you.

11:10.249 --> 11:13.341
- I'm just trying to help you...
- I've told him. He's not listening.

11:13.461 --> 11:15.359
He's not listening to me.
Here we go.

11:15.580 --> 11:16.799
You're gonna love this.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.260
Cassie?

11:26.980 --> 11:27.980
Yes?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.879
You're 43 minutes into
a two-hour philosophy A level paper

11:31.140 --> 11:34.290
and I'm pretty sure you
haven't written anything yet.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.420
No.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.300
Cassie...

11:42.919 --> 11:46.159
Everybody else has finished exams
and started their holidays.

11:46.784 --> 11:50.302
Here I am running a re-scheduled
exam especially for you.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.515
So, are you going to write anything?

11:55.140 --> 11:56.290
I'm not sure.

11:57.140 --> 11:58.700
What about?

11:58.820 --> 12:02.982
How long I can put off starting
to write and still get an A.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.670
Is it possible to truly enjoy power?

12:12.900 --> 12:13.900
Sorry?

12:14.260 --> 12:15.710
It's question three.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.122
I'm not supposed
to help you with your exam.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.850
I stopped eating and then
everyone had to do what I said.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.050
That was powerful.

12:25.380 --> 12:26.639
And did you enjoy that?

12:28.740 --> 12:31.490
I think it was
the happiest time of my life.

12:33.322 --> 12:36.478
But I had to stop
before I died, because...

12:38.548 --> 12:40.430
... otherwise it wasn't fun.

12:44.165 --> 12:45.880
You wouldn't understand.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.873
You're wrong, Cassie.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.930
Did you cut yourself too?

12:57.178 --> 12:59.161
People will do anything to...

13:00.700 --> 13:04.550
People will do anything to work out
why they feel bad, won't they?

13:06.875 --> 13:08.091
And did you?

13:08.873 --> 13:10.190
Work it out?

13:10.620 --> 13:11.670
Like I said,

13:12.220 --> 13:14.970
I'm not supposed to
help you with your exam.

13:15.180 --> 13:16.730
I want you to tell me!

13:17.313 --> 13:18.746
What?

13:19.140 --> 13:21.670
How to stop bad things happening.

13:22.770 --> 13:24.599
Doesn't work, does it?

13:24.719 --> 13:27.279
That's why you have
to start eating again.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.270
I fell in love.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.933
Ah, love.

13:32.830 --> 13:35.508
Why cut yourself
when you can be in love?

13:37.830 --> 13:40.580
You think passing an exam
will make me happy?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.879
Cassie, passing exams generally
only makes life more complicated.

13:45.799 --> 13:48.838
But there's lots of other stuff
that makes things bearable,

13:48.958 --> 13:50.759
and you don't even
have to use a knife.

13:52.180 --> 13:53.080
Like?

13:54.026 --> 13:55.100
Disco.

14:20.079 --> 14:22.199
Yes, hi Martin.
Are you on security?

14:45.646 --> 14:46.719
Come on, Doug.

14:47.021 --> 14:49.518
One blast, then Cassie's gonna write.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.499
Bye.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.920
Hey, Cass! How'd it go?

16:27.558 --> 16:29.719
Fine.
What are you doing?

16:30.643 --> 16:31.860
Well, er...

16:31.980 --> 16:34.532
I got hungry, like real hungry,

16:35.140 --> 16:38.078
and so Sid went to get stuff.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.324
Hey!

16:41.580 --> 16:43.520
You've finished! Congrats.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.680
- What happened?
- That was me. Reflex action.

16:54.110 --> 16:56.799
Yeah, seems he didn't need
his balls arranging after all.

16:57.860 --> 16:58.680
Funny.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.000
Thanks. You're... cooking.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.398
Yep, we're celebrating. I'm in love,
exams are over, and he's alive.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.084
I'm al-i-ve!

17:08.204 --> 17:10.547
I thought, "Fuck it,
let's make a night of it."

17:10.666 --> 17:11.719
How?

17:19.220 --> 17:20.220
Hi, Cassie.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.479
Cassie, listen. Come on.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.239
Forget it, Sid. I'm going.

17:25.718 --> 17:27.342
This is fucking ridiculous.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.769
Is she here yet?

17:39.884 --> 17:43.320
I've gotta tell you, mate.
Top notch. Mmmm, it's mega.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.000
Fucking A, Sid. Fucking A plus.

17:46.452 --> 17:47.875
A double plus!

17:51.502 --> 17:52.959
It's the vanilla, isn't it?

17:53.120 --> 17:55.814
- Maybe not that great with meatballs.
- Fuck.

17:56.060 --> 17:57.060
It's fine, Sid.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.620
I've never had cherries
and nuts in Smash before.

17:59.864 --> 18:02.319
- Bit of bite.
- Great, yeah.

18:02.637 --> 18:03.952
Love it.

18:05.435 --> 18:09.170
So... all pals together.
At a dinner party.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.230
Just like grown-ups.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.032
Let it go, Cass.
We're just trying to get on.

18:15.152 --> 18:18.384
Normally, I'd say "Let's stick
some hash in the meatballs."

18:18.504 --> 18:20.439
But these have a kick
all by themselves!

18:20.620 --> 18:22.359
Amaretto. It was on special offer.

18:27.353 --> 18:29.236
So, Michelle. What's the plan?

18:29.356 --> 18:31.319
You going to get back
together with Tony now?

18:31.540 --> 18:33.864
All lovey? Just like before?

18:36.140 --> 18:38.385
We're trying not to
make a thing of it, OK?

18:38.505 --> 18:41.231
All pals again. Smashing!

18:49.260 --> 18:51.310
Anyway, you and Sid, you know...

18:52.191 --> 18:53.559
It all came out right, yeah?

18:55.823 --> 18:58.919
And I'm properly forgetting
that I ever saw Michelle's breasts.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.999
- Or her pants...
- Yes, Sid.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.167
Or the freckle on the inside of...
I've gone too far again, haven't I?

19:04.820 --> 19:05.820
Yes.

19:06.059 --> 19:08.479
Mostly we're just happy that
Chris is all right. OK, Cass?

19:09.286 --> 19:10.102
Yes.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.799
I'm all right!

19:12.839 --> 19:14.919
Everyone's seen Michelle's breasts.

19:15.426 --> 19:18.100
- And that freckle on her fa...
- That's not the one I meant.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.959
Would it be helpful if
I say I love you again?

19:24.927 --> 19:26.393
He loves you, Cass.

19:27.851 --> 19:30.308
Which university are you
going to if you get your grades?

19:30.428 --> 19:31.959
- Cardiff.
- And you?

19:32.180 --> 19:33.180
York.

19:35.118 --> 19:38.389
You two must really love each other.
Like hardcore.

19:38.509 --> 19:40.255
I dunno, Cass. I guess we're...

19:40.375 --> 19:41.959
So tell me what the point is.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.415
- I didn't apply to univer...
- Yeah?

19:51.120 --> 19:52.190
Well, I did.

19:54.434 --> 19:56.479
You're all full of crap.
I'm going to bed.

20:00.086 --> 20:01.635
Do you want me to come?

20:01.755 --> 20:03.705
Yes, Sid. I want you to come.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.830
Think I'm gonna go.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.070
I'm sorry about
what happened, Cassie.

20:15.921 --> 20:17.040
I fucked up.

20:18.357 --> 20:20.039
Tony fucked up. Sid fucked up.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.679
Jal's fucked up worse than any of us
but it doesn't have to turn to shit.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.090
And you just put up with that?

20:28.910 --> 20:30.160
Grow up, Cass.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.999
That's it. I'm never putting
vanilla in anything ever again.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.639
- Shall I come with you?
- Yeah.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.506
- Come on, let's just go.
- Right.

20:44.626 --> 20:45.720
Guys?

20:47.820 --> 20:49.270
How's Jal fucked up?

20:52.681 --> 20:55.006
Sorry, the train was late and...

20:56.915 --> 20:58.480
What've you done?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.510
I don't know why I am
the way I am.

21:06.368 --> 21:08.750
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.978
Something makes me hate everything.

21:16.860 --> 21:17.860
Everything.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.890
That's what I like about you, Sid.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.770
You never try to explain things...

21:30.178 --> 21:31.264
No.

21:34.148 --> 21:35.830
I probably would if I could.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.510
We're finished.

21:45.199 --> 21:46.796
Do you realise that?

21:46.920 --> 21:47.920
Finished?

21:49.180 --> 21:52.630
Two weeks from today we get
our results and it's all over.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.230
We're grown up.

21:55.661 --> 21:57.360
We've made it. Done.

21:59.740 --> 22:01.290
That's good, isn't it?

22:01.719 --> 22:03.239
Everything ends badly.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.950
It doesn't have to.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.420
No?

22:08.740 --> 22:09.890
I've got you.

22:12.660 --> 22:15.799
Don't you wish you could go back
to when you hadn't lost anything?

22:18.460 --> 22:20.310
Everything's in the future.

22:22.020 --> 22:24.070
More shit to happen, that's all.

22:32.007 --> 22:33.238
I love you.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.610
I'm here now.

22:42.892 --> 22:44.759
That's the best I've got, Cass.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.566
Let's... never go.

23:02.477 --> 23:03.780
I wanna stay here.

23:04.358 --> 23:05.854
I don't want to go.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.780
I might have... I might have to go.

23:08.900 --> 23:09.900
Don't.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.850
She told you.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.820
Yeah.

24:02.420 --> 24:04.370
She tried to tell you before.

24:05.606 --> 24:06.706
I know.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.250
It's gonna be OK, though.

24:16.260 --> 24:17.610
Talked it through.

24:18.420 --> 24:19.670
We talked a lot.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.620
And?

24:24.541 --> 24:27.028
I'm not really qualified
to be a dad.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.610
I don't know what they do.

24:30.284 --> 24:31.500
And, um...

24:31.876 --> 24:34.900
She's gonna be famous, Cass.
I mean, she's gonna be great.

24:35.020 --> 24:36.159
Fucking mega.

24:38.381 --> 24:41.210
- I'm not exactly A plus...
- You're A plus, Chris.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.415
She just doesn't want a baby.

24:47.762 --> 24:49.790
No, I know. I'm on her side.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.770
She's all I got, so...

24:53.900 --> 24:55.350
... I'm on her side.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.070
Where's Sid?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.010
He went to do his milk round.

25:06.587 --> 25:09.190
I think he likes
having all that milk.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.957
Cool. Lots of milk.

25:12.321 --> 25:14.271
A truckload. All he can drink.

25:14.577 --> 25:16.170
He's a lucky man.

25:16.470 --> 25:17.820
Nonstop glugging.

25:17.940 --> 25:20.140
- He'll be chucking it down.
- He's milktastic.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.510
- Milkulous.
- He's a milkionaire.

25:27.820 --> 25:28.820
Tea?

25:29.585 --> 25:30.741
Tea.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.930
Do you live up there?

25:50.700 --> 25:51.700
Yes...

25:52.079 --> 25:53.700
Do you know Christopher?

25:53.820 --> 25:55.568
Yes, I live with him.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.020
Girlfriend?

25:57.660 --> 25:59.823
No. No, I just live with...

26:01.617 --> 26:03.036
Who are you?

26:04.629 --> 26:07.553
I just heard something about him.

26:08.420 --> 26:10.409
He was in hospital.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.190
But he's better now.

26:12.793 --> 26:14.199
He's not better.

26:14.361 --> 26:15.879
No, really. He's fine.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.220
You're her.

26:23.380 --> 26:24.830
You're Chris's mum.

26:27.260 --> 26:28.710
You should see him.

26:30.344 --> 26:33.210
- Please, come in and see him.
- His brother died.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.460
Peter died.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.510
And they say... Chris might.

26:42.619 --> 26:44.550
- Chris might...
- He's better! He's fine.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.260
Tell him...

26:48.580 --> 26:50.230
... I couldn't stand it.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.494
No, don't go!

26:56.780 --> 26:57.780
Chris!

28:13.760 --> 28:14.760
Ay-up.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.929
When's Jal getting back?

28:19.481 --> 28:20.481
Tomorrow.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.959
She said she wants me
to think about things.

28:24.414 --> 28:26.749
You could make her
change her mind...

28:26.869 --> 28:28.710
... if you wanted to.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.927
Listen, Cass. When a woman
of that calibre is prepared

28:32.047 --> 28:34.919
to get her tits out for you,
you don't mess it up on purpose.

28:35.893 --> 28:37.279
Ah, romantic.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.560
Ta.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.880
I fucking love her. That's it.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.750
Anyway...
You went to make tea six hours ago.

28:43.870 --> 28:46.518
Oh! Yes... I got the milk.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.720
I was talking to...

28:57.000 --> 28:58.499
... to someone outside...

28:58.619 --> 29:00.600
Yeah, well, that's all
very interesting,

29:00.720 --> 29:02.559
but it's not gonna make my tea,
is it?

29:03.395 --> 29:07.120
And girls who won't make my tea do
not ever get to see my cock again,

29:07.440 --> 29:10.184
and that is what you call
social deprivation.

29:12.179 --> 29:13.839
You cheeky, sexist fucker!

29:14.000 --> 29:15.559
I am, I'm a sexy fucker!

29:15.721 --> 29:18.479
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna wash your
big fucking mouth out!

29:20.476 --> 29:23.200
- Ah! Jesus Christ! Watch it!
- Oh, my god!

29:23.429 --> 29:24.279
Christ!

29:24.441 --> 29:27.099
Fuck! Chris, I forgot! Jesus!

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
Is it OK?

29:31.409 --> 29:32.800
Oh, yes!

29:32.979 --> 29:34.319
Shit! You bastard!

29:34.640 --> 29:37.633
And, I'm still
awaiting my tea, Wenchy.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.181
Wenchy?

29:41.320 --> 29:42.320
Yeah.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.830
Wenchy Foozy-Moo.

29:57.481 --> 29:59.778
You were right about Adam Sandler.

29:59.898 --> 30:02.960
He is quite sweet
if you keep the sound down.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.120
Nah, yeah, he's cool...

30:06.290 --> 30:08.684
Look. He's gonna
piss on himself again!

30:20.240 --> 30:21.821
Oh! Forgot...

30:22.160 --> 30:23.634
I got something for you.

30:23.754 --> 30:24.778
Yeah?

30:27.680 --> 30:29.330
Stole it on Park Street.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Smart.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.050
You were gonna tell me
who you were talking to outside.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.440
Cass?

30:45.840 --> 30:46.960
Oh, cool!

30:49.441 --> 30:50.441
Oh, man!

30:51.697 --> 30:53.120
Fucking A, man!

30:55.480 --> 30:58.440
Chris,
I've been thinking about secrets.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.480
Here comes the Monkey Man!

31:04.156 --> 31:07.890
Sometimes you have to keep them.
In case someone got hurt.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.519
Oh, I can't wait to
show this to, um...

31:13.040 --> 31:14.390
Show it to, um...

31:17.155 --> 31:18.000
Cass?

31:21.800 --> 31:23.264
Show it to, um...

31:25.120 --> 31:26.839
My girlfriend, what's her name?

31:28.142 --> 31:29.359
Don't be stupid!

31:38.120 --> 31:39.520
Spliff, I...

31:39.839 --> 31:41.080
I feel a bit...

31:44.520 --> 31:45.640
Shit.

31:49.580 --> 31:50.880
Chris?

31:56.315 --> 31:57.750
Chris, you OK?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
Come on!

32:06.682 --> 32:08.520
Fuck! Come on!

32:10.209 --> 32:12.359
Help! Please help.
He needs help!

32:12.539 --> 32:14.399
Number 4... Lewis Gate block!

32:16.103 --> 32:17.652
They're coming, Chris!

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
Got it...

32:34.639 --> 32:35.840
... Jal...

32:37.921 --> 32:39.071
... got it...

33:56.640 --> 33:59.050
Hey kid. Where you headin'?
Where you headin'?

33:59.920 --> 34:02.558
I don't'know...
Somewhere nice.

34:04.901 --> 34:06.725
- Yo, Earl!
- Yeah?

34:07.029 --> 34:09.790
The lady wants to go
someplace nice, man.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.610
Tell her to get the
fuck out of this neighbourhood!

34:56.456 --> 34:57.630
Thank you, Frank.

34:58.523 --> 35:00.503
Where are you going now?

35:01.407 --> 35:02.799
I haven't decided.

35:03.346 --> 35:05.001
Well, decide to eat.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.270
You gotta eat.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.720
Here.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.770
Look up there on the right.

35:14.890 --> 35:16.920
Martha serves chilli on Tuesdays,

35:17.237 --> 35:18.743
blow your balls off!

35:19.707 --> 35:20.884
Yeah.

35:32.601 --> 35:34.454
Hey, what the fuck
you looking at, man?

35:45.520 --> 35:47.570
You should eat that. It's good.

35:50.219 --> 35:51.719
I... think I'm hungry,

35:52.040 --> 35:53.390
but then I'm not.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.370
Tell you what...

36:03.490 --> 36:04.640
Skip it.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.790
This is so...

36:20.858 --> 36:22.248
It's nice of you.

36:22.368 --> 36:23.519
Sure it is.

36:31.899 --> 36:35.339
I take all this leftover food
after my shift.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.490
Nobody wants it.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.919
Guess they know I'm from Iowa.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.439
Where's that?

36:46.715 --> 36:47.960
Over there.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.650
About a thousand miles.

36:55.247 --> 36:56.679
Boy, you're raw, aren't you?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.486
Tired, mainly. Just tired.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.964
The bed's through there.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.270
Hey, be my guest.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.799
I'm wired after work.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.400
Hey. You found the shower.

38:26.033 --> 38:27.567
I just got back.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.559
Hope you don't mind but,

38:32.679 --> 38:35.338
you've been sleeping for two days and
I usually try to do...

38:35.458 --> 38:36.973
Two days?

38:39.340 --> 38:40.420
Where did you...?

38:42.019 --> 38:43.124
Couch.

38:43.531 --> 38:45.159
Anyway, I'll...

38:45.420 --> 38:46.701
No, it's OK.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.060
Please.

38:49.562 --> 38:52.800
Well, I just got to fix
these pictures up a little, then...

38:56.060 --> 38:57.810
Did you tell me your name?

38:58.780 --> 39:00.930
Yeah, couple of times. It's Adam.

39:02.410 --> 39:03.988
And you're Cassie.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.174
Hi. Again.

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
Hi.

39:11.138 --> 39:12.325
The pictures.

39:12.660 --> 39:14.210
Does anyone see them?

39:14.440 --> 39:17.630
No way.
I'm just your New York cliche.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.730
Waiting, waiting.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.677
Who's that in the photos?

39:29.380 --> 39:31.130
She takes a good picture.

39:32.140 --> 39:33.790
Is she your girlfriend?

39:36.999 --> 39:39.020
For a while, um...

39:39.140 --> 39:40.390
But she's, er...

39:41.380 --> 39:42.630
she's gone now.

39:49.223 --> 39:50.265
Adam?

39:50.740 --> 39:51.740
Yeah?

39:53.068 --> 39:55.999
I don't really want to fuck you,
if that's OK.

39:56.209 --> 39:58.359
- I didn't say...
- I thought you'd...

39:58.842 --> 40:01.079
No, you needed
somewhere to sleep, right?

40:01.563 --> 40:03.770
- Yes.
- So, it's cool.

40:04.687 --> 40:07.999
Stay here as long as you want.
Till whatever's going down is over.

40:11.334 --> 40:13.379
It won't ever be over.

40:15.174 --> 40:16.371
Yes, it will.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.399
Do you like to dance?

40:26.420 --> 40:28.160
It's two in the morning.

40:30.020 --> 40:32.170
You guys don't go out in England?

41:01.039 --> 41:02.039
Come on!

41:02.300 --> 41:03.750
I don't think I can.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.520
Come on!

41:45.293 --> 41:46.253
No.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.720
No! Put me down! Don't!

41:50.980 --> 41:52.330
Get out of my way!

42:23.740 --> 42:25.320
Boy, you can run.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.790
I'm fucked up.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.760
Yeah.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.640
I ran away.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.480
No.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.160
I thought Americans didn't do irony.

42:48.100 --> 42:50.680
It's Manhattan.
It's different.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.830
Don't you want to know what I did?

43:07.499 --> 43:08.999
Would it change anything?

43:10.400 --> 43:11.400
No.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.840
So...

43:15.312 --> 43:16.359
Let's go.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.870
Do they have boats on this river?

43:38.498 --> 43:41.170
- No.
- There! You did it again!

44:36.107 --> 44:37.450
Don't worry.

44:38.537 --> 44:39.680
He's OK.

44:40.492 --> 44:41.693
I won't touch.

45:17.649 --> 45:19.039
<i>Dear Cassie,</i>

45:21.160 --> 45:22.910
<i>I went away for a while.</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:24.570
<i>Get some snaps.</i>

45:28.440 --> 45:30.433
<i>Stay here for as long as you want.</i>

45:31.459 --> 45:33.000
<i>It was nice knowing you.</i>

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
<i>Adam.</i>

47:15.940 --> 47:18.080
{\a3}I need answers, Cassie.

47:18.300 --> 47:20.320
{\a3}I need answers right now!

47:21.159 --> 47:22.159
{\a3}Tony. Tony!

47:22.380 --> 47:24.559
{\a3}- I'm not ready for this.
- For what?

47:25.008 --> 47:26.099
{\a3}This.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.337
{\a3}I am the resurrection and the life.

47:28.457 --> 47:32.000
{\a3}I don't want you at the funeral.
Any of you.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.639
{\a3}What are you doing here?

47:33.860 --> 47:36.010
{\a3}I always loved you the best, Sid.
