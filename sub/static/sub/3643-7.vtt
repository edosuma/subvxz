WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.570
So, what do we got?

00:03.570 --> 00:06.213
Terry Colby was involved in the cover-up

00:06.214 --> 00:08.788
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.174
What do we need to prove our case?

00:11.209 --> 00:14.010
Someone who was there
when the decision was made

00:14.045 --> 00:16.346
to falsify chemical waste intel.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.848
Get the hell away from my
home. Get away from my home!

00:18.884 --> 00:21.217
Elliot, what is going on with you?

00:21.269 --> 00:23.803
I cannot help you if
you keep me in the dark.

00:23.855 --> 00:25.054
We got problems.

00:25.107 --> 00:26.890
The Dark Army is bailing.

00:26.942 --> 00:28.191
It's not over.

00:28.226 --> 00:30.226
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

00:30.228 --> 00:33.229
How do you not blow your
brains out married to him?

00:33.231 --> 00:34.731
You want to watch me piss too?

00:34.783 --> 00:38.067
- Scott, a misunderstanding...
- Happy to pull my dick out for you.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.819
Elliot!

00:39.871 --> 00:43.740
- Where is she?
- I told you you'd get her back, bro.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:50.525 --> 01:52.025
Shit!

02:03.872 --> 02:05.788
Shit!

02:09.494 --> 02:11.160
Open up!

02:11.213 --> 02:12.996
I'm bleeding all over the hallway!

02:14.799 --> 02:17.834
It's a life-or-death
situation out here!

02:17.886 --> 02:20.253
Look, I know you're in
there. I just saw you go in.

02:20.305 --> 02:23.506
Open up!

02:23.558 --> 02:25.675
I'm looking...

02:27.178 --> 02:29.512
Well, are you just gonna stand there?

02:29.564 --> 02:31.981
Get me a glass of water, dummy.

02:32.017 --> 02:34.484
Can I use this? Thanks.

02:36.738 --> 02:38.521
My niece gave him to me.

02:38.573 --> 02:41.524
I haven't even named him yet. God.

02:41.576 --> 02:43.826
Do you know the pressure
of an ecstatic six-year-old?

02:43.862 --> 02:47.830
I mean, I kill that thing,
and her whole world collapses.

02:47.866 --> 02:50.617
I like what you did with the place.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.702
Hmm.

02:52.704 --> 02:55.705
Yeah, nice setup. Still
like mine better though.

03:08.436 --> 03:12.388
Yo, let me know if you
want a top-shelf hookup.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.974
Actually, now that I have you...

03:15.026 --> 03:19.562
will you help me move
a dresser... Mr. Muscles?

03:19.564 --> 03:22.565
Okay, come on. Just come on.

03:32.877 --> 03:36.329
Man 'N' Van is getting way too legit.

03:36.381 --> 03:37.747
They used to just be, like, drummers

03:37.749 --> 03:39.248
with their mom's Honda Odysseys.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.584
Now it's an actual company in Queens.

03:41.586 --> 03:45.171
I mean, the guys are literally men in vans.

03:45.223 --> 03:46.589
I'd buy morphine from you,

03:46.591 --> 03:51.594
if you could also get me Suboxone.

03:51.596 --> 03:55.598
Well, it's pretty much
impossible to get Suboxone.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.433
My supplier doesn't have it.

04:02.407 --> 04:05.441
I saw this song live once. It was so rad.

04:05.443 --> 04:08.027
Don't you just love hearing
your favorite songs in person,

04:08.079 --> 04:10.530
like, half deaf from the speakers,

04:10.582 --> 04:15.084
- everyone going nuts around you?
- No.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.122
Direct. I respect that.

04:19.173 --> 04:22.959
I just hate concerts.

04:22.961 --> 04:24.794
Lots of people.

04:29.434 --> 04:33.970
- You don't like people, huh?
- Not most of them, no.

04:36.107 --> 04:37.473
Okay.

04:37.525 --> 04:39.976
Well, so by that rationale, if you were

04:40.028 --> 04:42.311
to really like one person, it'd be, like,

04:42.313 --> 04:47.116
considered an aberration or an abnormality

04:47.152 --> 04:51.621
- or special, even.
- I guess.

04:52.404 --> 04:54.824
Well, I aim for special,

04:54.876 --> 04:58.077
so challenge accepted.

05:04.169 --> 05:09.338
I wish we already knew each other.

05:09.391 --> 05:13.509
Would make this feel less awkward.

05:14.110 --> 05:19.677
- You really feel awkward right now?
- Yeah.

05:22.070 --> 05:25.521
Well, then I wish we
knew each other too then.

05:30.493 --> 05:31.694
Oh, yikes.

05:31.746 --> 05:36.449
I, um, I'm late. Meeting
the girls for drinks.

05:36.501 --> 05:38.701
Oh, um, I'm Shayla.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.540
Elliot.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.909
You know, I do know of
a guy who sells Suboxone.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.466
He's supposed to be
a fucking psychopath,

05:53.518 --> 05:54.801
but if you want, I can call him.

05:55.293 --> 05:57.250
You might be worth a psychopath.

05:57.251 --> 05:59.522
I don't know. Maybe.

05:59.557 --> 06:02.308
Oh, and keep the fish, you filthy animal.

06:11.693 --> 06:16.525
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

06:24.382 --> 06:27.150
Sorry I
haven't talked to you in a while.

06:27.185 --> 06:29.819
I mean, it's only been
a month, which I guess

06:29.854 --> 06:33.389
in the grand scheme of
things isn't that long.

06:33.441 --> 06:35.058
Isn't our life like a blip

06:35.110 --> 06:39.729
in the cosmic calender or something?

06:39.781 --> 06:42.031
So that's Shayla.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.866
A blip.

06:43.902 --> 06:45.485
Not even.

06:45.537 --> 06:47.904
Here one blip, gone the next.

06:47.906 --> 06:50.990
Makes me hate myself that
I've already gotten used to

06:51.042 --> 06:53.242
the idea of her not being here.

06:53.295 --> 06:55.244
In a year, I'll maybe think about her

06:55.297 --> 06:57.046
every once in a while.

06:57.082 --> 07:00.583
Then she'll become an
anecdote, a thing to say.

07:00.585 --> 07:03.252
"I knew a girl that died,"

07:03.254 --> 07:07.423
with the added bonus of,
"She died because of me."

07:07.475 --> 07:12.729
- Maybe I should hate myself.
- Here are the last two forms.

07:12.764 --> 07:14.397
She's getting rid of me,

07:14.432 --> 07:16.683
in case you're still
trying to figure that out.

07:16.735 --> 07:18.735
- Once I...
- Sign on the bottom.

07:23.274 --> 07:24.774
Then I'll deliver it to the court,

07:24.826 --> 07:26.192
and in two weeks' time, you'll receive

07:26.244 --> 07:28.945
an official release from the mandate.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.613
That second form means
that we've been sitting

07:30.665 --> 07:33.533
- in this room for a year.
- Over 52 hours

07:33.585 --> 07:35.952
of Krista's voice
bouncing around this room.

07:36.004 --> 07:39.622
She thinks she's a
wasted echo. Maybe she is.

07:39.674 --> 07:41.457
I wonder how much time I've spent

07:41.459 --> 07:44.460
- not listening to her in here.
- I'm worried about you, Elliot.

07:44.512 --> 07:46.218
I really want you to keep coming here.

07:46.219 --> 07:47.463
We've got a lot more work to do.

07:47.465 --> 07:48.965
She wants more from me

07:48.967 --> 07:50.600
but she doesn't believe in me.

07:50.635 --> 07:53.136
I tried because I believe
some part inside of you

07:53.138 --> 07:57.440
- wants to do this right.
- You?

07:57.475 --> 07:59.809
Are you on her side?

08:22.300 --> 08:24.467
You should clean your sockets.

08:36.847 --> 08:40.283
Sounds too good to be true, but I'll bite.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.320
- What's the ask?
- Given my client has information

08:43.355 --> 08:45.055
that could help your client's case,

08:45.090 --> 08:48.725
we want the meeting restricted
to her, Colby, and myself,

08:48.761 --> 08:53.030
- and we want it conducted off-record.
- Antara, come on.

08:53.711 --> 08:58.174
- My client won't accept your presence.
- Our client pays for ours.

08:58.175 --> 09:00.203
Then you're duty-bound to present him

09:00.255 --> 09:03.140
with any legitimate offer
of beneficial evidence.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.975
Of course.

09:05.010 --> 09:09.679
Give us something truly
legitimate and beneficial.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.349
You won't even tell us what
the hell your client has.

09:12.384 --> 09:15.385
Seth, we've been sitting on opposite sides

09:15.421 --> 09:17.587
of the negotiating table for two decades.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.489
I'm not some joker come out of the woodwork

09:19.525 --> 09:21.324
trying to scam Colby for millions.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.527
I'm giving him the only
glimmer of hope he's had.

09:26.398 --> 09:29.866
We'll pass along your
offer. Thanks for your time.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.970
Lloyd said you wanted to see me.

09:54.476 --> 09:57.928
Look, I appreciate your
commitment to this job.

09:57.980 --> 10:01.264
I really do.

10:01.266 --> 10:04.101
But I don't see how you've plowed through

10:04.103 --> 10:08.688
these last few weeks, so I
want to offer you some time off.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.440
- Just some time to...
- I don't need time off.

10:10.492 --> 10:13.610
I'm good.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.333
Uh... uh, one more thing.

10:22.042 --> 10:23.759
Look,

10:25.757 --> 10:28.625
I'm so sorry she was taken away, Elliot,

10:28.627 --> 10:34.131
but don't let her death
close you off entirely.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.799
Find someone you can be

10:35.851 --> 10:40.604
your honest self with, okay?

10:40.639 --> 10:43.140
I remember when
I was a kid, I got into web design

10:43.142 --> 10:44.975
by ripping off sites I liked.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.561
All you had to do was
view source on your browser

10:47.613 --> 10:49.980
and there it was, the code.

10:50.032 --> 10:53.400
You could copy-paste
it, modify it a little,

10:53.452 --> 10:59.322
put your name on it, and
like that, it was your site.

10:59.374 --> 11:01.158
View source.

11:01.210 --> 11:04.161
What if we had that for people?

11:04.213 --> 11:06.329
Would people really want to see?

11:09.334 --> 11:11.615
- _
- _

11:11.616 --> 11:12.426
_

11:12.427 --> 11:13.907
_

11:13.908 --> 11:15.596
_

11:15.597 --> 11:18.280
_

11:18.281 --> 11:22.145
Find someone to be your honest self with?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.597
Bullshit.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.187
Really good advice. Thanks.

11:33.659 --> 11:37.611
I quote, "The U.S.
contingent of the hacker group Fsociety

11:37.663 --> 11:39.529
"has remained quiet since
the upheaval inflicted

11:39.531 --> 11:42.032
"upon the world's largest
multinational conglomerate.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.451
"Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson

11:44.503 --> 11:46.620
"released a statement today stating that,

11:46.672 --> 11:49.339
"'These groups lack the
resources and knowledge

of the U.S cell to
successfully mount an attack.'"

11:52.878 --> 11:55.462
End quote.

11:55.514 --> 12:00.684
- Yeah, so?
- We gotta get the Dark Army back.

12:00.719 --> 12:04.137
Dude, I've been trying.

12:04.189 --> 12:06.723
How many times do you want me to hack him?

12:06.725 --> 12:09.142
Do you know how hard hacking a hacker is?

12:09.194 --> 12:13.396
- Cisco switches OSes, like, all the time.
- Darlene, we need one meeting.

12:13.448 --> 12:15.982
Yeah, well, I've been using Cisco's handle

12:16.034 --> 12:18.652
to send requests for the past month.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.737
I got nothing.

12:20.789 --> 12:23.156
He's slower than me, but not by much.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.408
If we can talk to
whiterose directly...

12:25.410 --> 12:28.078
Whiterose? Whiterose?

12:28.130 --> 12:30.880
Really?

12:30.916 --> 12:34.551
Okay, if the guy even exists,

12:34.586 --> 12:40.507
and that's a big if, no way
he's meeting you face-to-face.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.592
For all we know...

12:42.594 --> 12:44.678
this dude's whiterose.

12:44.730 --> 12:47.731
Excuse me!

12:47.766 --> 12:49.649
Are you whiterose?

12:52.404 --> 12:55.905
A likely story.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.942
'Sides, the tape backups already shipped

12:58.944 --> 13:01.194
to all the new Steel Mountain facilities,

13:01.246 --> 13:05.282
and we still haven't
found a way around that.

13:05.334 --> 13:10.787
- I got a plan in motion.
- And God's laughing.

13:31.073 --> 13:33.857
This
is all I have left of her.

13:39.565 --> 13:42.232
I will miss her.

13:50.793 --> 13:52.125
I need to wipe again.

14:15.601 --> 14:17.984
So if you scroll to the next page,

14:18.020 --> 14:19.820
you'll see the summary of capital budgets

14:19.855 --> 14:23.714
- or purchasing and operations.
- We get it. The goddamn earning reports

14:23.715 --> 14:27.277
- are gonna look good come Monday.
- Our aim is to facilitate bill payment

14:27.329 --> 14:29.329
and heighten financial security,

14:29.364 --> 14:31.081
so that's an extra 2%.

14:31.116 --> 14:32.449
You know, if we hadn't
turned our profits around,

14:32.451 --> 14:34.618
- I was gonna leave.
- No way.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.586
Where? Don't tell me Apple.

14:36.622 --> 14:38.955
- Google.
- Don't buy it.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.757
I got a blow job from the hiring executive

14:40.793 --> 14:42.626
on the Googleplex volleyball court.

14:42.678 --> 14:44.294
Oh, she was hot.

14:44.346 --> 14:49.433
Had a Marissa Mayer thing going on too.

14:49.468 --> 14:51.351
Hot execs started as hot assistants

14:51.386 --> 14:52.803
who fucked their way to the top

14:52.805 --> 14:54.771
twice as fast as the rest of us.

14:54.807 --> 14:56.973
You know something screwed up?

14:57.025 --> 14:59.476
I heard that, some
assistants, they're going gay

14:59.528 --> 15:02.612
- to move up the ladder.
- I'll do you one better.

15:02.648 --> 15:04.197
There's a special handful

15:04.233 --> 15:07.534
of pathetically desperate
execs going cock jockey.

15:07.569 --> 15:10.120
No. Oh, my God!

15:10.155 --> 15:12.823
Hey, Dwight, I meant to
ask. How are your children?

15:12.875 --> 15:15.041
Hell if I know. Sent 'em off to Lawrence.

15:15.077 --> 15:16.793
I think Julia likes art.

15:16.829 --> 15:20.547
- Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.
- Lawrence?

15:20.582 --> 15:21.965
You'll never be able

15:22.000 --> 15:24.134
to afford that tuition on unemployment.

15:24.169 --> 15:27.170
- Sorry?
- You're fired!

15:45.607 --> 15:47.858
You two as well.

15:47.910 --> 15:50.861
I'm making sure you all receive
the minimum severance packages.

15:52.364 --> 15:55.832
Mr. Wellick, I don't understand.

15:55.868 --> 15:57.534
What did we do?

16:04.426 --> 16:08.879
Nothing.

16:08.881 --> 16:11.848
- After...
- You said you would update me.

16:11.884 --> 16:13.717
I needed to discuss our situation

16:13.719 --> 16:15.886
with the state's attorney.

16:15.938 --> 16:21.224
- Thanks for coming in, Roy.
- Yeah.

16:23.612 --> 16:27.230
I think you should have a seat.

16:31.987 --> 16:34.120
Colby's lawyers called 30 minutes ago.

16:34.156 --> 16:37.073
They wanted a promise of total
immunity before the meeting,

16:37.075 --> 16:39.626
which I obtained from the man you just met.

16:39.661 --> 16:43.713
So, yes, Colby agreed...

16:43.749 --> 16:46.967
with a caveat.

16:47.002 --> 16:50.136
I can't be in the room.
You have to go in alone.

16:55.143 --> 16:59.763
Look, you made a ballsy move...

16:59.765 --> 17:02.232
but you doing what
you're about to do...

17:02.267 --> 17:04.267
entering the home of a very powerful man

17:04.269 --> 17:07.069
with a lot at stake and
asking him for something...

17:07.105 --> 17:10.991
that's always a dangerous proposition.

17:11.026 --> 17:14.611
So one last time...

17:14.663 --> 17:16.613
are you sure you want to do this?

17:32.798 --> 17:35.098
Shit, man.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.683
Thought you was one of them high schoolers

17:36.718 --> 17:38.685
stole my mom's chaise lounge.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.971
As heartbreaking as it is to hear that,

17:41.023 --> 17:42.138
you're gonna have to put that off.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.807
Getting everybody back together.

17:43.809 --> 17:45.308
- Come on.
- No, man, not this time.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.644
I'm out.

17:47.696 --> 17:49.696
You can't be out. We need you.

17:49.731 --> 17:52.649
Look, man, I got a new set of
people depending on me, okay?

17:52.701 --> 17:54.484
Clients out the wazoo.

17:54.536 --> 17:56.202
So, you know, I mean, good luck,

17:56.238 --> 17:59.122
and tell the kids I said hi.

17:59.157 --> 18:03.326
- What is this? What are you doing here?
- Well, I figured out how to insert

18:03.328 --> 18:06.496
THC's genetic information
code into yeast cells.

18:06.548 --> 18:08.498
Tripled my earning speed.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.501
Plants need weeks to
develop. Microbes need days.

18:11.553 --> 18:14.504
So, what, you got a Bath and Body Works

18:14.506 --> 18:20.175
- bottling facility in your backyard?
- Try it.

18:20.228 --> 18:22.646
The THC level is borderline in that blend,

18:22.681 --> 18:26.016
and the lavender doesn't
mess with the high.

18:26.068 --> 18:28.018
You just smooth it on your skin.

18:28.070 --> 18:31.187
So you're rejecting a revolution
in favor of aroma profiles?

18:31.239 --> 18:33.189
What a waste of potential.

18:33.191 --> 18:35.358
Look, man, I know I got a good brain.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.528
Besides...

18:38.530 --> 18:41.865
what was our little
project in the end, anyway?

18:41.917 --> 18:45.502
Wasted shit, if you ask me.

18:45.537 --> 18:47.837
Well, now you're borderline pissing me off.

18:47.873 --> 18:52.208
Is that a fact?

18:52.210 --> 18:53.877
And what exactly are you gonna do

18:53.929 --> 19:00.384
- if I decide to cross that border?
- Look at my face, Romero.

19:00.435 --> 19:02.719
You and I both know I'm crazy.

19:02.721 --> 19:04.387
Not the cute kind either.

19:04.389 --> 19:07.474
I'm talking crazy crazy!

19:11.396 --> 19:13.446
You lost touch.

19:13.482 --> 19:14.898
You forgot the feeling of spilling blood

19:14.900 --> 19:18.234
on the battlefield by winning the fight.

19:18.236 --> 19:20.904
I didn't want to hurt you, Romero.

19:20.906 --> 19:22.872
I love you, man.

19:22.908 --> 19:24.908
I just wanted you to come
back to the arcade with me

19:24.910 --> 19:28.411
so we could change the world together.

19:28.413 --> 19:32.749
I am clearly too crazy
for you to say no to.

19:32.801 --> 19:33.883
Bang!

19:38.840 --> 19:45.428
- Look on your face is priceless!
- Goddamn lunatic.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.263
You gave me your word
when we started this thing

19:47.315 --> 19:48.765
that you'd finish it.

19:48.817 --> 19:51.901
I gave you my word what
I'd do if you didn't.

19:51.937 --> 19:53.653
See you back at the arcade.

20:10.849 --> 20:13.517
Good. I see the girl got you tea.

20:17.724 --> 20:19.473
Well, let's get started.

20:26.232 --> 20:29.266
How much do you want?

20:31.571 --> 20:34.939
Write your number.

20:34.991 --> 20:37.608
You can ask me anything you want,

20:37.610 --> 20:39.910
but I promise you, at the end of the day,

20:39.946 --> 20:42.947
money will always be better
than what you're looking for.

20:46.419 --> 20:49.787
Mr. Colby, did you attend

20:49.839 --> 20:53.290
the executive board meetings during 1993?

20:57.096 --> 20:59.964
Were you in the room
when the decision was made

21:00.016 --> 21:02.049
to ignore the treatment of hazardous waste

21:02.101 --> 21:04.018
in Washington Township?

21:10.810 --> 21:13.811
I have information which can help you...

21:13.863 --> 21:18.566
if you answer my question.

21:18.618 --> 21:22.653
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:22.705 --> 21:25.656
If you agree to testify
against the executives

21:25.708 --> 21:30.161
who covered up the illegal
dumping of expoxy resin waste,

21:30.213 --> 21:32.163
I will testify that I
broke chain of custody

21:32.215 --> 21:34.882
with the dat file central to your case.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.506
You're that hot little thing

21:42.508 --> 21:44.091
that came by here a month ago.

21:44.143 --> 21:47.895
The girl from Allsafe.

21:50.650 --> 21:53.734
I remember, yeah.

21:57.690 --> 22:03.194
Okay... I'm gonna answer your question.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.113
But here's what I need from you first.

22:06.165 --> 22:09.450
So I'm gonna pull down my pants,

22:09.502 --> 22:12.536
and then I'm gonna need you to
take that pouty mouth of yours

22:12.588 --> 22:15.039
and swallow up my balls.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.292
Now, they're big and hairy,
especially the left one,

22:18.344 --> 22:20.628
so you're really gonna
have to, I don't know,

22:20.680 --> 22:24.014
squish 'em up to get 'em inside there.

22:24.050 --> 22:26.550
You're probably gonna have
to do one cheek at a time.

22:26.552 --> 22:31.138
But then, once they're
all warm and snug in there,

22:31.190 --> 22:34.725
I want you to repeat your question to me

22:34.777 --> 22:37.978
as clearly as you can.

22:38.030 --> 22:42.233
Then, and only then,
am I willing to answer.

22:46.405 --> 22:49.406
What do you say?

23:06.926 --> 23:11.061
If you don't take this deal...

23:11.097 --> 23:14.932
you'll become like me.

23:14.984 --> 23:19.853
Sure, maybe you'll live in this house...

23:19.906 --> 23:22.106
maybe you'll have money,

23:22.158 --> 23:24.275
but even if your expensive
lawyers find a way

23:24.327 --> 23:29.113
to get you off, people will
still think that you're guilty.

23:35.454 --> 23:41.258
Losing everyone's respect...

23:43.462 --> 23:46.263
The respect of people you know

23:46.299 --> 23:52.219
and the people you don't...

23:52.271 --> 23:57.141
it's a shitty feeling.

23:57.193 --> 23:59.977
Trust me.

24:13.159 --> 24:17.161
I'll have "the girl" let me out.

24:24.003 --> 24:27.338
Flipper. Is she microchipped?

24:34.563 --> 24:38.182
Okay, very good.

24:38.234 --> 24:39.400
Housekeeping done.

24:39.401 --> 24:42.186
Now onto the real business.

24:42.595 --> 24:48.932
- Has your dog ever eaten trash before?
- No. I mean, not that I remember.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.161
Well, lucky for your bank account,

24:51.197 --> 24:53.364
the piece is small
enough to pass on its own.

24:53.416 --> 24:55.366
Unfortunately, though, it's large enough

24:55.368 --> 24:57.368
to send her puking all over your apartment.

24:57.370 --> 25:01.372
So I would crate her for
a few days and monitor her.

25:01.424 --> 25:04.092
She won't know what you're
doing is good for her.

25:18.274 --> 25:19.690
What the hell did you do?

25:19.725 --> 25:22.226
You were right. I was
only trying to prove...

25:22.228 --> 25:24.778
Colby's lawyers
just called. He wants to talk.

25:25.699 --> 25:28.400
Get back there.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.745
It's a little early in the
morning to be nerding out,

25:41.797 --> 25:46.129
- don't you think?
- How long?

25:52.725 --> 25:54.224
- Hmm?
- I knew if I asked you that...

25:54.260 --> 25:58.755
- How long?
- Couple weeks.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.269
And you had the balls to ask
for whiterose with my shit?

26:05.271 --> 26:08.272
It's like you want to get us both killed.

26:08.324 --> 26:11.161
What happened? He responded?

26:12.778 --> 26:16.413
You know, you didn't have to make me look

26:16.449 --> 26:17.865
like a shitty foot soldier.

26:17.917 --> 26:21.705
- Nobody would ever even know...
- You got root on my box and found the IP,

26:21.706 --> 26:25.506
then you joined their
channel with my handle.

26:30.346 --> 26:34.465
We're so done.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.133
I don't want to see you again.

26:42.608 --> 26:44.942
But you fools actually got your wish.

26:46.645 --> 26:47.529
I don't know why,

26:47.530 --> 26:48.982
but the meeting's actually gonna be on.

26:49.682 --> 26:51.982
I'd tell you to be careful, but I know

26:51.984 --> 26:53.884
that's the last thing you're gonna be.

27:09.781 --> 27:14.535
My lawyers are looking over the paperwork.

27:14.587 --> 27:18.005
- Does that mean that...
- Exactly what I said.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.207
I asked you back here to make
sure that you can pull off

27:20.259 --> 27:22.876
your testimony, make sure that this

27:22.928 --> 27:24.511
chain of custody story
of yours is straight.

27:24.547 --> 27:30.217
- I can't afford any trips.
- I'm not going to trip.

27:33.556 --> 27:35.806
So, what...

27:35.858 --> 27:37.474
what's in this for you, anyway?

27:37.526 --> 27:40.477
I know you hate me.

27:40.479 --> 27:42.896
So, what, you're gonna
just let me off Scot-free?

27:42.948 --> 27:49.641
- What do you get out of this?
- Earlier, I asked you a question.

27:50.740 --> 27:53.991
You never answered it.

27:53.993 --> 27:59.379
If I'm agreeing to testify
in your case, then, yes,

27:59.415 --> 28:01.832
you know, I attended several meetings.

28:01.834 --> 28:07.004
Tell me about the one when
they decided to ignore the leak.

28:07.006 --> 28:09.339
I'm not sure what you're asking.

28:09.341 --> 28:13.060
What was the meeting like
when you decided this?

28:15.598 --> 28:18.182
I get it.

28:18.184 --> 28:20.934
You want to know, like, what was it like?

28:20.986 --> 28:25.189
Like, um, did we all have
cigars and laugh hysterically

28:25.241 --> 28:27.241
as we signed the evil documents?

28:27.276 --> 28:29.026
Is that what you pictured?

28:29.078 --> 28:30.410
Well, I'm sorry, hon.

28:30.446 --> 28:33.080
See, the world doesn't work like that.

28:33.115 --> 28:37.251
Tell me. Tell me how it works.

28:40.456 --> 28:44.041
Uh, Jesus, um... all right, all right.

28:44.043 --> 28:49.096
Let's see. January, '93.

28:49.131 --> 28:51.765
Well, my secretary then was Elaine.

28:51.801 --> 28:54.268
So Elaine brought us a
platter of shrimp cocktail

28:54.303 --> 28:58.388
to tide us to dinner, which pissed us off

28:58.390 --> 29:01.775
because we just had a
platter at the holiday party.

29:01.811 --> 29:03.227
Jim opened the bar.

29:03.279 --> 29:05.729
Now Jim was a real piece of work.

29:05.731 --> 29:07.981
I mean, half pansy, half mafia.

29:08.033 --> 29:11.485
First sign of a tight
decision, he'd be chain smoking

29:11.537 --> 29:14.404
down a river of scotch.

29:14.406 --> 29:17.741
Uh...

29:17.793 --> 29:19.576
you know, it rained.

29:19.578 --> 29:22.546
It rained. I remember that, yeah.

29:26.585 --> 29:28.969
So...

29:29.004 --> 29:34.591
you were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail,

29:34.643 --> 29:38.312
and it was raining when you
decided my mother would die?

29:46.272 --> 29:49.439
That's why.

29:49.441 --> 29:53.193
So people like you won't keep
sitting in rooms together.

30:00.786 --> 30:05.622
Did any of it ever give you or anyone pause

30:05.624 --> 30:12.480
- when you made those decisions?
- Yeah.

30:14.183 --> 30:16.300
Yeah, sure.

30:19.221 --> 30:23.473
But, um...

30:23.475 --> 30:27.861
then you go home, and,
uh, and you have dinner,

30:27.897 --> 30:32.532
you know, and you
wake up the next morning.

30:40.159 --> 30:43.994
Here's to a man who has a
bright future at our company,

30:43.996 --> 30:46.413
a man you all know,

30:46.465 --> 30:49.917
a man who is going to change
this company for the good,

30:49.969 --> 30:55.005
a man smart enough to marry
a woman every bit his equal...

30:56.759 --> 31:01.678
Our new Chief Technology
Officer, Scott Knowles.

31:01.730 --> 31:04.821
- Here, here!
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:05.234 --> 31:06.516
- Thank you, Phillip.
- Welcome.

31:06.568 --> 31:08.185
- Thank you very much.
- Here we go.

31:08.187 --> 31:09.736
- It's great to be here.
- And we're off.

31:09.772 --> 31:11.438
- Thanks, Phillip.
- You're very welcome.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.774
- Congratulations, darling.
- Thank you, thank you.

31:13.826 --> 31:16.276
- I'll leave you to it, okay?
- Don't break a sweat.

31:16.328 --> 31:18.445
- Oh, here, come, say hello.
- Hey, Joe, how are you?

31:22.418 --> 31:24.418
_

31:39.184 --> 31:41.601
Thank you.

31:46.642 --> 31:50.394
- Tyrell, nice to see you.
- Is it?

31:50.396 --> 31:52.562
I hear you shared our
moment with your husband.

31:52.564 --> 31:54.398
Oh, come on.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.116
That was over a month ago.

31:56.151 --> 31:58.902
Don't tell me you're still sore.

31:58.954 --> 32:01.989
Hmm, I sense some defeat.

32:09.331 --> 32:14.418
Well, I considered myself, at
the very least, reprimanded.

32:14.420 --> 32:16.136
How disappointing.

32:16.171 --> 32:18.755
One tiny curveball and you gave up.

32:18.807 --> 32:22.009
- Miss.
- Thank you.

32:22.061 --> 32:23.593
Should have known that
you were nothing more

32:23.645 --> 32:26.146
than a bold entrance.

32:26.181 --> 32:28.682
Are you saying you don't
crave a bold entrance

32:28.734 --> 32:33.153
every time, over and over, sustained?

32:33.188 --> 32:36.940
- Meet me tonight.
- I'm a little busy.

32:36.942 --> 32:39.993
- Come to my office now.
- Are you really asking me that?

32:40.029 --> 32:43.113
I don't recall phrasing
it as a question, no.

32:43.165 --> 32:46.333
Fine, then I just won't show up.

32:46.368 --> 32:48.368
Then the roof.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.837
Take the back stairwell.

32:50.873 --> 32:53.123
The cameras have been out since March.

32:53.125 --> 32:56.209
No one will know.

33:01.216 --> 33:02.883
Well, you just made a long day longer.

33:02.935 --> 33:04.718
I know that Allsafe will have to fire me,

33:04.770 --> 33:06.553
but testifying was the right thing to do.

33:06.605 --> 33:09.222
I have worked my ass
off to take care of you

33:09.274 --> 33:11.024
and of every person in this company.

33:11.060 --> 33:15.047
- Do you know what that means?
- You've been a great boss, Gideon...

33:15.048 --> 33:18.148
See, once this confession goes public,

33:18.200 --> 33:20.150
no one will want to do business with us.

33:20.202 --> 33:21.735
The company will go under.

33:21.787 --> 33:23.203
I couldn't let Colby take the fall

33:23.238 --> 33:24.988
- for something that I did.
- Oh, come on!

33:24.990 --> 33:26.656
You and I both know you
didn't break chain of custody.

33:26.658 --> 33:32.796
- I did and I feel terrible...
- Angela! Please! Stop lying.

33:36.301 --> 33:41.588
You do this... all these people go down,

33:41.640 --> 33:44.674
all their families that rely

33:44.726 --> 33:48.228
on what this company provides for them.

34:10.002 --> 34:14.254
So this is where the rabbit hole leads?

34:14.289 --> 34:15.422
Got to be honest,

34:15.456 --> 34:18.458
I half-expected you not to show up.

34:18.510 --> 34:22.379
And I half-expected
you to be a tattletale.

34:22.431 --> 34:24.297
So you are sore.

34:24.349 --> 34:26.800
Oh, come on. You intrigued me.

34:26.851 --> 34:29.386
I intrigued back.

34:29.438 --> 34:34.283
- Can't we just be more straightforward?
- Oh, that's no fun, but if you insist,

34:34.938 --> 34:37.310
I just came up here to
see if you were really

34:37.362 --> 34:40.397
as gullible as you seem.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.899
My husband's downstairs
getting the job that you want,

34:42.951 --> 34:44.900
and you're up here trying to fuck me.

34:44.953 --> 34:47.404
Now whether that's you
being straightforward

34:47.406 --> 34:49.623
or a game, either way,

34:49.658 --> 34:54.911
- it's played pretty poorly, if you ask me.
- Hmm. Again, I asked no question.

34:54.913 --> 34:56.913
All I can tell you is you need this

34:56.965 --> 34:59.299
'cause you're dissatisfied.

34:59.334 --> 35:02.085
Scott plans on firing you,

35:02.087 --> 35:06.089
and you are clinging on
to any chance you can get.

35:06.141 --> 35:09.593
You seem desperate.

35:57.109 --> 35:59.142
Hey... hey!

35:59.194 --> 36:01.645
What do you... get off of me!

36:01.697 --> 36:04.197
Stop!

38:02.295 --> 38:04.379
We connected with whiterose.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.414
The plan is back on.

38:08.752 --> 38:13.087
I could bullshit you, tell
you you're the only person

38:13.139 --> 38:17.592
who can fill the exact
void we have at Fsociety.

38:17.644 --> 38:19.677
The truth is, I need
this group back together.

38:25.101 --> 38:26.434
Have you ever considered which part

38:26.486 --> 38:29.437
of our scheme motivates you?

38:29.439 --> 38:31.322
When the Dark Army bailed, you didn't care

38:31.358 --> 38:34.409
if pushing a button would
bring an economic revolution.

38:34.444 --> 38:37.612
You want momentary anarchy.

38:37.614 --> 38:39.280
The others?

38:39.282 --> 38:41.115
Mobley likes palling around.

38:41.167 --> 38:43.785
Romero wants a whiff of fame.

38:43.837 --> 38:46.504
Those reasons depress me.

38:50.210 --> 38:54.512
- What's the part you want?
- You don't care.

39:01.888 --> 39:04.138
My parents were born in Iran.

39:04.190 --> 39:06.274
They came here like everybody else,

39:06.309 --> 39:07.475
for freedom,

39:07.527 --> 39:09.644
but my dad works 60-hour weeks

39:09.646 --> 39:13.531
to determine tax loopholes
for a millionaire art dealer.

39:13.566 --> 39:16.451
My mom, she ran up loans into five digits

39:16.486 --> 39:19.320
to get an online degree.

39:19.372 --> 39:22.990
They won't shut up about
how great America is.

39:23.043 --> 39:25.793
But they're gonna die in debt doing things

39:25.829 --> 39:27.912
they never wanted to do.

39:35.004 --> 39:36.795
There are how many billion

39:36.796 --> 39:40.308
- people in this world?
- 7.3.

39:40.343 --> 39:44.312
Somehow you and I landed together...

39:44.347 --> 39:47.065
doing something impossible
if we were alone,

39:47.100 --> 39:49.567
not to mention at the
right point in history

39:49.602 --> 39:51.986
with the right resources.

39:52.021 --> 39:53.688
We have what we've worked for

39:53.690 --> 39:56.240
right there for the taking.

39:56.276 --> 39:58.910
We just need each other
to see this through.

40:13.927 --> 40:16.627
You come any closer, I'm calling the cops.

40:21.718 --> 40:25.720
Hi, operator. I'd like
to report an emergency.

40:25.772 --> 40:28.389
I placed a malicious
CD in my work computer,

40:28.391 --> 40:31.859
and now this guy at the
gym is saying hi to me.

40:31.895 --> 40:34.499
- I'm going home.
- I need you to do something for me.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.031
Call the girl who wants
to be involved, okay?

40:37.066 --> 40:38.449
Her name is Angela Moss.

40:38.485 --> 40:40.334
- Let me give you her phone number.
- Listen, pussy.

40:40.335 --> 40:41.953
If you don't do what I say,

40:41.988 --> 40:44.405
then the giant shit storm
that rains turds later

40:44.457 --> 40:48.409
will leave a trail of clouds in
the sky spelling out your name.

40:56.586 --> 40:57.822
Elliot?

40:59.266 --> 41:03.715
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I'm here for my appointment.

41:06.262 --> 41:08.930
Well, you can slip in
before my first patient.

41:29.209 --> 41:33.338
- You told me I should tell you the truth.
- Yes.

41:35.208 --> 41:40.461
Everything I say will still
be protected and confidential?

41:46.219 --> 41:50.638
I've been lying to you.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.357
I don't take my pills.

41:53.393 --> 41:56.811
But you don't either.

41:56.813 --> 41:58.696
Your refill frequency
for Ativan doesn't match

41:58.731 --> 42:00.948
your prescription divided by the dosage.

42:06.406 --> 42:09.874
This morning...

42:09.909 --> 42:12.660
you bought a tall hazelnut latte.

42:12.712 --> 42:15.546
Paid for it on your Evil Corp card.

42:15.582 --> 42:18.499
By text, you justified the
indulgence to your sister

42:18.501 --> 42:20.668
because Evil Corp gives you double rewards.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.505
But those points only
accumulate on travel expenses.

42:24.507 --> 42:27.174
You're not good with money.

42:27.227 --> 42:31.646
On paper, your Thursday
2:00, Marilyn O'Brien,

42:31.681 --> 42:34.348
is your doppelganger.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.568
I think you're encouraging her

42:37.604 --> 42:41.822
to leave her husband...

42:41.858 --> 42:43.858
because you're tired of being dumped.

42:47.747 --> 42:49.530
You like porn, especially anal.

42:49.582 --> 42:51.198
Whether you like it yourself, I don't know.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.584
That's not relevant to me.

42:53.620 --> 42:55.703
You've told your best friend Jennifer

42:55.705 --> 43:01.542
that you wish your mom would die.

43:01.544 --> 43:04.929
I sometimes watch you on your webcam.

43:04.964 --> 43:09.216
You cry sometimes...

43:09.269 --> 43:13.721
just like me.

43:13.773 --> 43:16.390
Because you're lonely.

43:22.282 --> 43:24.198
I don't just hack you, Krista.

43:24.233 --> 43:26.784
I hack everyone...

43:26.819 --> 43:29.954
my friends, coworkers.

43:35.411 --> 43:38.462
But I've helped a lot of people.

43:44.003 --> 43:48.255
I want...

43:48.308 --> 43:53.311
a way out of loneliness...

43:53.346 --> 43:55.896
just like you.

44:07.276 --> 44:10.661
Is that what you wanted to hear?
