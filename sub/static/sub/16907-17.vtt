00:02.169 --> 00:03.261
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.799
I have a village, too,
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.892
You will go to Russia and find my parents,

00:09.092 --> 00:10.935
and tell them what happened
to me and Vlad.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.396
Taiana, I'm sorry.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.528
Tell me who this "Prometheus" is.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.200
I guess you know
what I've been up to, huh?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.444
Remember, I'm always ten steps
ahead of you.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.493
- What's <i>going</i> on?
- Chase is gone.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.950
- So is Oliver.
- We have to assume Chase has him.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.751
Just make sure he suffers.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.917
That was always the plan.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.169
<i>PROMETHEUS". Did you hesitate at all</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:41.375
<i>- when you killed him?</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:44.632
<i>Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:47.715
<i>If you kill me,
you'll only really be killing yourself.</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:52.019
<i>Five, four, three, two, one...</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.564
Hundred and forty-five seconds.

00:59.935 --> 01:03.155
That's how long my father struggled
under the water before he died.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.902
According to my father's autopsy,
your arrow pierced his aortic arch,

01:08.110 --> 01:09.236
but it didn't kill him.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.784
No, he was still conscious enough

01:11.989 --> 01:15.459
to feel his lungs filling with water
for 145 seconds.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.411
And here you were

01:18.328 --> 01:21.707
bragging about a plan
more intricate than torture.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.969
Did you ever think about
why I chose the name Prometheus?

01:30.841 --> 01:34.095
He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.850
See, because like you,
they play judge, jury and executioner.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.402
But Prometheus took away their power.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.771
If that's what you're gonna do to me,

01:46.189 --> 01:49.363
you'll need to come up with something
better than whatever this is.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.657
I did.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.703
And the only way for you to stop it

01:55.866 --> 01:57.038
is to confess.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.295
- I killed your father.
- Nothing so pedestrian.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.757
I want you to tell me your secret, Oliver.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.885
I want you to confess to the one thing

02:07.044 --> 02:09.092
that you've been afraid
to admit to yourself.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.048
How many times am I going to tell you

02:11.214 --> 02:13.216
that I don't know
what you're talking about?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.348
Fine.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.680
You'll come around eventually.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.728
Now, where were we?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.815
One forty-five, one forty-four,
one forty-three...

02:31.443 --> 02:35.118
Bandages and water will not help me.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.079
Before you die, tell us what you meant.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.289
You said if we kill you,
we kill ourselves.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
<i>Why'?</i>

02:42.913 --> 02:44.836
You will find out soon enough.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.130
You're gonna tell me now

02:49.086 --> 02:51.134
or I'm going to dig that
bullet out of your arm.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.552
Go to hell.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.350
Oliver! Oliver!

02:56.343 --> 02:57.344
What are you doing?

02:57.552 --> 02:59.600
He will never tell you truth
in that much pain.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.779
Does this has to do with your deal
with Kovar, yes?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.191
<i>Samovol'shchina.</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:15.533
If you know what it was or what is coming,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.661
you will beg Kovar to spare you.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.126
And you are no one's hero.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.212
Everything

03:27.374 --> 03:30.048
and everyone that you love,

03:32.003 --> 03:33.346
will wither

03:34.464 --> 03:36.592
<i>and die at your touch.</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:53.567
<i>Da.</i>

03:53.984 --> 03:55.281
Good riddance.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.571
What do we do about Kovar?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.160
What does it matter?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.243
Our Pakhan is dead.
We must swear in a new one.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.751
<i>ANATOLY". There are men loyal to us,</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:06.288
and men loyal to Gregor,
all without Pakhan.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.543
How do we choose a new one?

04:07.789 --> 04:10.167
Pakhan is determined by seniority.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.973
Why is he doing that?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.813
It's for journey to afterlife.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.190
Makes good gift in heaven,

04:29.728 --> 04:31.856
but even better bribe for Satan.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.611
<i>Da.</i>

04:41.740 --> 04:44.710
You can get in there, too.
You're one of us.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.941
<i>AY-.</i>

05:58.275 --> 06:00.403
Viktor, I think he cut into tendon.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.571
I don't think he's very happy
you're Pakhan.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.873
You think? I know.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.995
I wish there was less painful transfer
of power in Bratva.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.670
What are we gonna do about Kovar?

06:11.288 --> 06:13.791
You're asking for yourself
or you're asking for Bratva?

06:13.999 --> 06:16.593
Anatoly, Gregor made it sound like
all of us were going to be killed.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.919
<i>Samovol'shchina.</i>

06:18.086 --> 06:20.088
"Do as you will."
But he made it sound like there was some...

06:20.255 --> 06:23.600
Some deeper meaning? Yeah, it comes from
Russian Revolution, 1917.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.302
Why is he quoting the Russian Revolution?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.768
I can't think of any good reason.
Maybe ask Kovar when I talk to him.

06:28.972 --> 06:29.973
What?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.351
You can't meet with Kovar.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.020
Kovar had deal with Gregor.
Gregor is dead.

06:35.270 --> 06:39.116
As new Pakhan, I have to meet with him,
he will suspect something is up.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.779
- I could try to talk to Galina.
- To who?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.323
- I told you about Taiana.
- Oh, yes.

06:46.489 --> 06:50.585
Galina is her mother
and she works for Kovar.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.046
Maybe she heard something.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.558
Oh!

07:17.729 --> 07:20.528
Your boss, you work for Konstantin Kovar?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.411
- He said you were enemy.
- No, no.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.408
- A bad man.
- No, no, no.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.078
I'm friends with Taiana.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.038
My precious Taiana?

07:31.368 --> 07:34.167
Well, we're friends.
And I could use your help.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.214
- With some things...
- Mmm-hmm.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.602
Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you,
I'm not gonna hurt you. Listen to me.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.945
When Kovar hears about this,
you cannot say you saw me,

07:59.145 --> 08:01.273
do you understand?
You say you saw me, he'll hurt you.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.608
All right? All right.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.411
<i>KOVAR". My father once told me,</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.956
"Do not have 100 rubles,

08:10.448 --> 08:12.325
"but have 100 friends."

08:13.785 --> 08:16.789
Fortunately for us,
we have both friends and money.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.086
Yes, I assume your presence here means
that our arrangement has borne fruit?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.256
The shipment was routed to this location.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.676
The BIC codes are inside.
All you have to do is retrieve it.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.638
And as for my compensation,
I think that...

08:34.139 --> 08:35.686
Unidac Industries, yes.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.979
I will make sure you get
the information you desire.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.524
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some other business to attend to.

08:43.815 --> 08:44.862
My apologies.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.372
Malcolm Merlyn,
CEO of Merlyn Global Group.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.117
Anatoly Knyazev, gangster.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.091
You undercut your new station,
Mr. Knyazev.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.803
Pakhan of the Solntsevskaya Bratva,
it's...

09:10.633 --> 09:11.885
It's no small feat.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.936
<i>Nor</i> is <i>samovol'shchina.</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:17.314
One of Gregor's last words.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.188
And, uh...

09:21.811 --> 09:25.236
Were his other last words
about who killed him?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.489
He called the man <i>Kapiushon.</i>

09:28.651 --> 09:29.777
- Hood.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.827
The reports of man with a bow and arrow

09:32.989 --> 09:35.833
are disrupting business,
Bratva and otherwise.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.339
It's interesting.
I heard some reports of my own...

09:41.831 --> 09:45.802
Of you having trouble with Gregor
because of his deal with me.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.134
I questioned it, yes.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.848
<i>Now that</i> I <i>am Pakhan,</i>

09:52.008 --> 09:55.512
I'm obligated to live up to commitments
that he made.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.014
<i>Such</i> as <i>samovol'shchina?</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:00.733
You study history, Mr. Knyazev?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.028
When the Soviet Union was dissolved,

10:04.187 --> 10:07.532
many thought that
the capitalist opportunities will

10:07.690 --> 10:10.364
give rise to a more stronger,

10:10.568 --> 10:12.696
a more united Russian people.

10:13.363 --> 10:17.038
But then powerful men at the KGB,
Communist Party,

10:17.200 --> 10:21.046
the Komsomol, they decided to
cash in on their privileges.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.706
And, uh...

10:25.083 --> 10:27.381
Russia became not stronger,

10:27.544 --> 10:30.548
but diseased.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.348
And samovol'shchina was the cure once.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.064
It could be so again.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.029
Right, what does that mean?

10:46.187 --> 10:50.283
It means Kovar is planning something
very big and very terrible.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.193
What is he gonna do?

10:54.696 --> 10:58.041
Oliver, maybe time is best
for you to go back to America.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.325
Anatoly.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.286
We're brothers.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.956
What's happening to you
is happening to me.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.425
Kovar is going to overthrow
Russian government.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.757
<i>Samovol'shchina</i> is <i>coup.</i>

11:13.965 --> 11:15.763
And, I mean, he just told you this?

11:15.925 --> 11:19.429
Before I got there, he was making deal
with American businessman.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.099
Some secret, sensitive shipment.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.516
Do you think it's a weapon?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.562
Kovar has many men,
but not enough for a coup.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.480
But with weapon...

11:28.646 --> 11:31.775
Luckily, I got a chance to see
the file they're working on,

11:32.275 --> 11:34.869
Orekhovo-Zuyevo.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.451
It is a shipyard in Moscow.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.958
Then we go to the shipyard.
We stop Kovar from retrieving it.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.915
Seeing you take bullets out of Gregor,

11:43.953 --> 11:45.000
I saw him again.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.041
Face of the monster.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.345
This place, it's not good for you, Oliver.
Go home.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.177
I didn't save you from Gregor

11:55.340 --> 11:58.014
to stand by while you're murdered
by Kovar.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
This isn't over for me.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.691
So be it, brother.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.795
Do they look familiar?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.753
Do you even remember their faces?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.843
These are your victims.

12:37.715 --> 12:42.061
They were people who did terrible things.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.898
They had victims.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.684
And husbands. And wives.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.942
Daughters.

12:49.852 --> 12:50.978
Sons.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.738
Confess your secret, Oliver,
and all of this ends.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.204
I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out
that door and go back home.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.910
Adrian, you're sick

13:03.283 --> 13:05.377
and you're a hypocrite.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.540
There is nothing that I've done
that compares with you.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.713
Murdered your own wife...

13:16.004 --> 13:17.301
Cecil Adams.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.343
You knew him by his street name,
The Count.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.688
You put three arrows in him.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.724
He was gonna kill a friend of mine.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.484
Felicity Smoak, yeah.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.074
Confess or you get the same three arrows.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.082
Go to hell.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.080
I've already been there, Oliver.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.670
And I've come back with a message for you.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.934
- Are we all clear?
- Clear.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.774
See how easy it is to think first,
and kill people later?

14:36.459 --> 14:37.551
What is that?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.589
Sarin gas. Enough to kill thousands.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.145
What's next?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.062
You said something
when I brought you here.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.363
About how your friends are your strength.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.689
Now...

15:00.483 --> 15:02.656
She didn't even know
I was in her apartment.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.073
Oh, I swear to God, if you hurt her...

15:07.281 --> 15:08.828
<i>You'll do absolutely nothing.</i>

15:09.325 --> 15:10.702
Because you're here.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.755
You see, until you confess
your secret, Oliver,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.842
everyone that you love is at play.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.378
Even your son.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.683
<i>You're bluffing.</i>

15:27.844 --> 15:29.187
He's in hiding.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.059
I don't even know where he is.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.849
Because you haven't really looked.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.519
But for me,
we both know it's just a matter of time.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.363
<i>Confess.</i>

15:41.232 --> 15:43.200
I don't know what you want me to say.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.288
Then I guess I should leave you here
to think about it.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.324
And wonder who I might kill
while I'm gone.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.458
Adrian! Adrian, please!

15:53.035 --> 15:54.753
All you have to do is say the words.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.835
I...

16:00.084 --> 16:01.427
That's what I thought.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.546
See you soon.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.601
We have incoming.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.812
The truck!

17:36.097 --> 17:37.815
Kovar has the Sarin gas.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.190
Then we are all going to be dead men.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.167
- How's Anatoly?
- Recovering.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.453
Which is more than I can say for our men.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.663
- The sarin gas get him?
- <i>Da</i>.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.714
Where were you?

18:02.873 --> 18:06.093
I was keeping Overwatch,
like Anatoly ordered.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.178
You have something to say to me, Viktor,
so just say it.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.768
It was your idea to go against Gregor.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.513
Because of Kovar,
with your vendetta against him.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.148
- Now look at the mess we're in.
- Well, do you have a better idea?

18:19.974 --> 18:22.443
We should be honoring Gregor's pact
with Kovar. Not this.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.112
The moment that Kovar
overthrows the government,

18:25.271 --> 18:27.194
he is going to wipe out the entire Bratva.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.484
Where are you going?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.612
We have one of Kovar's men

18:32.778 --> 18:35.372
and we need to know
where the gas is gonna be used.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.117
Why would he tell you anything?

18:41.704 --> 18:43.081
He won't be talking to me.

18:48.711 --> 18:52.432
Please, I don't know anything.
There's no need to hurt me.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.051
Quiet.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.568
A friend of mine recently showed me
the skinning technique

19:04.727 --> 19:06.274
used by hunters of Mongolia.

19:07.271 --> 19:11.572
They remove all the skin
of things much larger than you

19:11.734 --> 19:13.407
in less than five minutes.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.529
Which means,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.283
you don't have very long

19:18.574 --> 19:21.703
to tell me what your boss is planning.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.086
I don't know anything.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.092
I was kind of hoping you would say that.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.353
What is this monstrosity?

19:39.762 --> 19:40.934
You should be resting.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.900
I woke up with headache.
I came to find you,

19:44.100 --> 19:45.602
I was not expecting this.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.403
This is not human.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.356
Anatoly, I told you.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.775
Putting on this hood,

19:52.942 --> 19:55.115
it helps me direct
the darkness inside of me.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.122
And it worked, by the way.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.999
I know what Kovar is planning.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.830
<i>But at what cost?</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:06.919
You're a fool to think a piece of cloth
can separate man from monster.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.208
Dividing yourself in two

20:09.875 --> 20:14.381
will only make monster stronger,
until it is stronger than you.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.468
You knew what I was capable of
back on Lian Yu.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.054
Yeah.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.234
But this man I see now

20:28.519 --> 20:32.149
bears more resemblance to Slade Wilson
or Anthony lvo.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.493
Tough man.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.868
Clearly withstood a lot before breaking.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.792
He gave up pretty quickly.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.965
The rest was me practicing.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.760
Practicing to become what?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.883
Something else.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.220
Kovar's inviting key members
of the government,

21:03.345 --> 21:06.224
politicians and military mostly,
to the opening of his casino.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.727
And kill them with sarin gas,
even the innocents?

21:08.934 --> 21:09.981
It's not good for business.

21:10.186 --> 21:14.282
Yes, but being in charge of whole country
is good for business.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.942
We need to get into that casino,

21:16.108 --> 21:18.202
and we need to stop the attack
before it happens.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.532
Place will be fortress,

21:19.904 --> 21:22.657
increased security
for president and generals.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.366
Impossible to break in.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.160
Then what do you suggest we do?

21:26.952 --> 21:27.953
We sneak in.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.872
Without the help of someone
working for Kovar?

21:30.080 --> 21:31.206
I know someone.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.875
Well, if you're thinking about house lady,

21:33.083 --> 21:34.255
last time it did not go so well.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.007
Give me a second chance.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.507
And if second chance doesn't work?

21:47.598 --> 21:48.645
Mrs. Venediktov?

21:53.729 --> 21:54.821
He's fine.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.732
Well, he's unconscious, but... Look,

21:56.941 --> 21:59.194
I'm sorry that I scared you
the other night.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.574
I just, I need to speak with you. I...

22:01.862 --> 22:05.912
Well, it's like I said,
I knew your children Taiana and Vlad.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.829
Do you know what happened to them?

22:11.831 --> 22:15.586
I'm sorry. They're dead.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.760
But Mr. Kovar say
he's still looking for them.

22:20.923 --> 22:21.924
Kovar is lying.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.638
Before she died, Taiana,

22:24.677 --> 22:26.520
she told me that he was a monster.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.982
And she made me promise, she made me swear

22:30.808 --> 22:32.355
that I would bring him to justice.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.990
But even what you say is true,
what can I do?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.988
Taiana told me that...

22:41.402 --> 22:45.657
"The same hammer that shatters glass,

22:45.823 --> 22:46.824
"forges steel."

22:47.408 --> 22:50.287
I say to her as a child
to make her grow up strong.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.453
Well, she did.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.383
And she helped me grow strong, too.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.629
Would you please,

23:00.462 --> 23:02.931
please help me keep my promise to her?

23:10.139 --> 23:13.769
This gets me into Mr. Kovar's buildings.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.443
Thank you.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.313
Make it right for them.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.529
Uh...

23:21.609 --> 23:22.656
Tell me,

23:24.612 --> 23:26.660
who killed my children?

23:29.450 --> 23:30.827
A monster.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.897
What did you do to her?

23:53.641 --> 23:57.020
I made her more compliant.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.867
Get up.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.949
Give yourself a chance.

24:14.745 --> 24:15.871
I'm...

24:16.664 --> 24:18.211
I'm not gonna fight her.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.126
I don't want you to fight her.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.885
I want you to kill her.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.588
<i>I'm gonna leave now.</i>

24:23.754 --> 24:27.099
When I come back,
either she's killed you and I let her go,

24:27.257 --> 24:29.510
<i>or you kill her and I let you go.</i>

24:30.094 --> 24:33.223
No. Neither one of those things
is gonna happen.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.358
If you don't kill her,
you're gonna watch me snap her neck.

24:36.517 --> 24:40.192
Adrian, what is the point of this?

24:40.437 --> 24:45.284
You seem to be having a little bit of
trouble figuring out what your secret is.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.864
I thought this might remind you.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.405
Good luck.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.752
I'm sorry, Oliver.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.135
I can't take another day in here.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.301
I think it's a...

26:19.578 --> 26:20.955
Canisters are in a storeroom.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.464
<i>Southwest corner. Second floor.</i>

26:22.664 --> 26:23.881
Copy that.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.927
<i>Okay, if you'd be so kind
to let us in now, please?</i>

26:32.049 --> 26:33.676
- I'll meet you at the target.
<i>- Da</i>.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.522
I took you into my home.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.072
I gave you food and shelter.
This is how you repay me?

27:06.875 --> 27:07.876
Now where?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.421
I studied the map.
I know a shortcut. Here.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.758
Are you sure this is the way?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.931
Almost there.
Should be at the turn up ahead.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.653
You sold us out.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.069
We're in a casino, Anatoly.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.994
I like to think of it as
playing the hand I was dealt.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.190
Evelyn? Hey, look at me, listen to me.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.481
I need you to bring the knife over here.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.943
I want you to get me out of these things.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.988
When he comes back...

28:18.363 --> 28:19.865
We will ambush him.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.828
No, we can't beat him.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.835
I didn't know what I was buying into
when I sided with him. I...

28:27.998 --> 28:31.172
It's okay. I forgive you. I, uh...

28:32.294 --> 28:34.797
I just, I think that together,
we can get through this.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.472
I'm dead.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.015
That's all he kept telling me. I'm dead

28:41.178 --> 28:43.647
because I was a part of your life.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.355
Will you bring me the knife?

28:52.439 --> 28:54.988
Will you bring me the knife,
and I can save us?

28:57.527 --> 28:58.619
No!

29:01.323 --> 29:02.870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.004
Oh, my God!

29:11.166 --> 29:13.134
Come on!

29:13.418 --> 29:14.840
<i>Are we serious?</i>

29:15.128 --> 29:17.381
Oliver, what are you trying to prove, man?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.800
Evelyn betrayed you,
you've killed people for less.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.437
I'm not gonna kill her,
I won't, just let her go.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.810
You're forgetting what I told you

29:25.973 --> 29:28.226
- would happen if you didn't kill her.
- No!

29:28.433 --> 29:31.027
- No!
- Adrian, will you please, okay?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.067
You have made your point.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.403
Confess, Oliver. Tell me your secret.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.907
I don't know what you want from me!

29:39.069 --> 29:40.321
I want you to tell me what you've been

29:40.487 --> 29:43.366
too afraid to tell your sister,
Felicity, Diggle.

29:43.532 --> 29:44.909
Tell me!

29:47.536 --> 29:50.415
I don't know! I don't.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.716
Wrong answer.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.358
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Finally, we're getting somewhere.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.064
Confess.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.663
<i>Oliver, we've been betrayed! Viktor,</i> he...

30:33.206 --> 30:35.584
<i>KOVAR". I'm so very proud of this casino,</i>

30:36.335 --> 30:38.178
and what it means for our country.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.473
Well, that's why it saddens me
to tell you that

30:41.631 --> 30:45.056
there was an attempt
by Solntsevskaya Bratva

30:45.218 --> 30:47.312
to crash these festivities,

30:47.471 --> 30:51.601
and assassinate every one of these
government officials here tonight.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.314
But don't worry,

30:53.477 --> 30:54.820
we have them all in custody.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.197
<i>Yes.</i>

31:06.948 --> 31:10.953
I'm told they planned
to stage a gas attack

31:11.119 --> 31:12.291
in this very room.

31:15.248 --> 31:20.175
<i>But, uh, sadly for them, even though they
were successful in launching the attack...</i>

31:22.047 --> 31:23.765
<i>It backfired and</i>

31:24.424 --> 31:27.303
killed every single one of them.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.224
Well, at least,

31:29.805 --> 31:33.651
that's what the newspapers
will report in the morning.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.483
Good evening.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.745
Confess.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.620
<i>You killed my father
because he was a name on a list.</i>

31:49.783 --> 31:52.161
But that's not really true, is it? No.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.271
It's too late, <i>Kapiushon.</i>

32:11.680 --> 32:13.307
<i>The gas has only done its work.</i>

32:14.015 --> 32:15.858
The list was just an excuse.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.895
The hood, the disguise, just an excuse.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.778
The idea that all of this is
some heroic crusade, is just an excuse.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.533
Excuse for what?

32:23.859 --> 32:26.829
- Huh? Tell me!
- You tell me, Oliver.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.704
You tell me.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.075
Kill him.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.845
Oliver Queen.

32:48.175 --> 32:50.428
Who could have imagined?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.853
I know what's going on
through your mind, Oliver.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.943
You're thinking that you can get
yourself free from those chains,

33:02.147 --> 33:05.367
lay me to the ground and snap my neck,
just like I did to Evelyn.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.487
There it is.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.743
There's the look I've been waiting to see.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.783
But it's not just about stopping me,
is it?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.372
No, there's something else in there.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.212
Confess, Oliver.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.342
When you see Taiana in the afterlife...

33:23.877 --> 33:25.470
Give her a kiss for me.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.821
- I'm going to finish this.
- No!

33:47.108 --> 33:50.453
Are you going to let your Pakhan finish it
for you, Mr. Queen?

33:50.612 --> 33:51.613
You don't have to do this, Oliver.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.665
We both know that I do.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.324
You don't have to, Oliver.
The man will face justice, I promise.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.545
You're right.
He'll face justice.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.516
<i>You've told yourself you kill
because you have to.</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:57.596
Confess, Oliver.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.732
You don't kill because you have to.
So, why...

35:01.516 --> 35:03.769
- Why do you do it?
- Because I wanted to.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.312
What?

35:06.688 --> 35:07.814
I wanted to.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.825
I wanted to!

35:10.984 --> 35:12.736
And I liked it!

35:23.872 --> 35:25.294
How's it feel?

35:25.957 --> 35:29.712
Knowing that I saw the one thing
you couldn't admit to yourself?

35:30.420 --> 35:31.717
<i>WOMAN". I knew he'd break.</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:39.350
Just like you said he would.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.732
<i>It's because I know him
better than he even knows himself.</i>

35:43.058 --> 35:44.731
Give us a moment alone, would you?

35:55.737 --> 35:59.241
I told you, Oliver.
You infect every life you touch.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.164
<i>Now do you realize why?</i>

36:03.662 --> 36:07.257
It's because your crusade
was based on a lie.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.671
You used your father's memory
to justify a killing spree.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.135
There's a price to be paid
for that, Oliver.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.433
Your mother paid it.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.898
Your friend Tommy paid it. Laurel.

36:24.265 --> 36:27.018
Do you really want to tell me
that John Diggle and Felicity Smoak's

36:27.185 --> 36:29.608
lives are better having known you?

36:31.231 --> 36:34.906
You promised to let me go.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.321
<i>And I'm</i> a <i>man of my word.</i>

36:37.487 --> 36:39.455
But first, I have a gift for you.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.663
This tattoo of yours.

36:47.872 --> 36:52.423
To be an American
and named a Captain in the Bratva,

36:53.461 --> 36:55.805
<i>you must have done
something extraordinary.</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:58.057
When you look at it, it must...

36:58.341 --> 37:00.890
It must remind you of such a victory.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.768
Now when you look at it,

37:07.934 --> 37:10.437
you'll think about our time here together.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.990
And the secret that you confessed to me.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.489
Whatever pain I caused you...

37:20.989 --> 37:22.332
I'm sorry.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.538
I believe you, Oliver.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.333
I just don't care.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.851
You know, I've decided.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.182
You are my favorite American.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.846
How many Americans do you know?

37:45.096 --> 37:48.396
You and joking are not exactly
made for each other.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.689
But that looks like it does.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.196
Anatoly, why make me a Captain?

37:53.563 --> 37:54.735
I'm not staying in Russia.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.196
Because now anywhere you go in the world,

37:57.358 --> 38:00.077
any Bratva you meet will know
what kind of man you are.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.364
Come, I have another gift for you.

38:07.869 --> 38:08.961
Here,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.465
I recovered it from the casino.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.051
Thank you.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.927
You remember the first time
we met on Amazo?

38:21.841 --> 38:24.094
I was performing surgery on myself.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.849
That's kind of difficult to forget.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.889
Yeah. What was it I said to you then?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.520
"Living is not for the weak."

38:29.933 --> 38:33.312
I cannot believe scared boy
in cell beside me

38:33.478 --> 38:35.401
would be one to kill Konstantin Kovar.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.361
Well, that wasn't me.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.369
- That was him.
- That is a lie you tell yourself.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.280
An excuse that allows you to kill.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.242
But you kill because you like it.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.831
That's not true, Anatoly, I hate it.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.421
And I think maybe you've had
a bit too much to drink.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.753
Well, that is entirely possible.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.010
But in this case, lam right.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.388
This deal you've sold yourself on,

39:00.547 --> 39:05.178
like this hood is going to keep
this monster of yours at bay?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.889
Someday it's going to fall apart.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.315
And when it does,

39:11.474 --> 39:14.774
you're not going to like the man
you see underneath.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.194
Well?

39:23.361 --> 39:27.036
It will take weeks
until he's back on his feet.

39:27.198 --> 39:31.044
But he'll live. He gives you his thanks.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.459
Just out of morbid curiosity,

39:34.163 --> 39:35.460
who did this to him?

39:36.082 --> 39:37.834
That's his business.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.797
Well, whoever it is,

39:41.963 --> 39:43.761
I'm glad I'm not him.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.762
- How much longer?
- "How much longer?"

40:30.970 --> 40:33.189
We've literally had to re-route
the electro-optical digital imaging

40:33.348 --> 40:35.350
from every reconnaissance satellite
I could gain access to.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.565
Then we had to capture data
in a four-dimensional array

40:38.728 --> 40:41.402
which could then be parsed
using a real-time algorithm.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.192
Basically, solving cold fusion
would have been easier.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.360
Okay, I'm sorry.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.244
Just been at this so long
I don't know which way is up.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.371
And Oliver's been gone for six days and...

40:49.530 --> 40:51.032
And, and what?

40:52.325 --> 40:54.623
- Oliver? Oh, my God!
- Oliver?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.136
Chase had me.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.387
And he let me go.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.518
Go slow, man.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.684
It's over.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.068
Oliver, we're gonna get this
son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.533
John, it's...

41:28.569 --> 41:31.072
It's over for me.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.744
I don't wanna do this anymore.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.257
I'm shutting everything down.
