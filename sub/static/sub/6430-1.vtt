WEBVTT

00:01.277 --> 00:02.477
Previously on Warehouse 13...

00:03.372 --> 00:05.106
We have competition.

00:05.175 --> 00:07.075
MacPherson.
Who?

00:07.143 --> 00:08.333
Leena, I know him.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.570
He was Joshua's physics Professor,
Professor Reynolds.

00:11.638 --> 00:13.347
The Phoenix.

00:13.415 --> 00:16.087
Those who touch the Phoenix,
they will be spared.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.652
What is it?

00:17.721 --> 00:20.980
It looks like Claudia was the last one
to have access to the Phoenix.

00:21.048 --> 00:22.780
The thimble.

00:22.846 --> 00:26.378
James MacPherson, you're under arrest.

00:26.446 --> 00:28.145
We'll put him in the bronze sector.

00:28.213 --> 00:31.210
What we do is we flash-freeze
the bodies cryogenically,

00:31.278 --> 00:33.976
and we preserve them by bronzing.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.076
Something's wrong.

00:41.145 --> 00:42.277
Turn around.

00:42.345 --> 00:43.910
Yes, ma'am.

00:46.912 --> 00:48.811
Thank you for remembering
our appointment.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.780
Artie!

00:57.848 --> 00:58.914
Wait! Wait!
Wait for us!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.859 --> 01:19.526
Artie!

01:19.594 --> 01:22.761
Do you think there's
any way he could've survived?

01:22.830 --> 01:24.130
I don't know.

01:42.576 --> 01:45.276
Quickly. We don't have much time.

01:45.344 --> 01:47.277
Why?

01:47.346 --> 01:49.679
Huh?
Why didn't he wait for us?

01:49.747 --> 01:51.813
What are we gonna do?

01:51.882 --> 01:53.516
Top of my list,

01:53.583 --> 01:56.517
kill that son of a bitch MacPherson.

01:58.387 --> 02:00.387
Oh, my God.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.992
Pete.

02:09.794 --> 02:10.961
Pete, what is that?
I don't know.

02:11.029 --> 02:12.196
Get back over here.
It might be a--

02:12.263 --> 02:13.964
no, I don't--
I don't think it is.

02:14.032 --> 02:15.796
Oh, my God.

02:15.865 --> 02:17.997
Are you getting a vibe?

02:18.065 --> 02:19.098
A good one.

02:27.506 --> 02:29.005
So that's how it works.

02:29.073 --> 02:31.273
Artie!
Artie!

02:34.510 --> 02:36.377
Oh, my God,
it's really you.

02:36.445 --> 02:38.412
You scared the hell out of us.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.047
We thought for sure
you were a goner.

02:40.115 --> 02:41.148
I'm all right.
I'm fine.

02:41.216 --> 02:42.049
It's just that I don't know how--

02:42.117 --> 02:44.784
I have never been so happy

02:44.852 --> 02:47.052
to see you.
Thanks.

02:47.121 --> 02:49.188
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good.

02:53.026 --> 02:54.192
Oh, God.
Yeah.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.727
I know.

02:56.795 --> 02:58.696
But, Artie, how could
you possibly have survived?

03:03.837 --> 03:05.104
The Phoenix.

03:05.171 --> 03:06.805
Wait a minute.

03:06.872 --> 03:08.105
If--if you use the Phoenix,

03:08.173 --> 03:10.173
that means someone's got to die, right?

03:10.241 --> 03:11.575
One of us?

03:11.642 --> 03:13.876
But, Artie--

03:13.943 --> 03:16.645
Pete?
No. No, no, no.

03:16.713 --> 03:19.014
Pete! Pete!

03:19.081 --> 03:20.481
Artie, do something.

03:20.549 --> 03:22.816
Just hang on.

03:22.885 --> 03:24.218
Artie!

03:24.286 --> 03:25.586
Artie!

03:28.490 --> 03:29.956
No, I'm okay.

03:30.024 --> 03:31.924
No, I was choking.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.859
It's dust or something.

03:33.928 --> 03:35.028
You're okay.

03:35.095 --> 03:37.696
Yeah, just--
oh, God.

03:37.764 --> 03:39.664
Was I choking on you, Artie?

03:39.733 --> 03:42.201
That's--Ahh.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.207
Are you all right?

03:51.276 --> 03:54.777
Artie, if it's not Pete,

03:54.845 --> 03:56.145
then, um...

04:07.289 --> 04:09.456
Mrs. Frederic!

04:13.862 --> 04:16.196
Mrs. Frederic's in there.
Got to get her out.

04:16.265 --> 04:17.930
No, no, no.
Artie, wait. Artie, wait!

04:17.999 --> 04:19.733
What is that?
There.

04:33.049 --> 04:35.416
So it was Mrs. Frederic, then.

04:35.484 --> 04:39.019
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

04:39.088 --> 04:40.555
Did you have any trouble?

04:40.623 --> 04:42.156
No.

04:42.224 --> 04:45.392
But I'd recommend 24 hours'
isolation from light.

04:45.461 --> 04:47.829
I'll contact you with instructions.

04:47.897 --> 04:49.897
Until then, you know what to do.

04:49.965 --> 04:52.466
Yes, I'll take care of it all.

04:54.770 --> 04:56.871
Come on, old friend.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.307
We've got a great deal
to catch up on.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.877
Welcome to the future.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.981
Let's change it, shall we?

05:47.458 --> 05:49.392
This is my fault.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.494
If I hadn't used the Phoenix,

05:51.562 --> 05:54.564
then your driver
would be alive, and...

05:54.631 --> 05:57.099
Be...

05:57.168 --> 06:00.470
I'm sorry.

06:00.537 --> 06:02.271
We need you.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.409
Find Claudia.

06:06.477 --> 06:08.744
Joshua.

06:08.813 --> 06:11.381
MacPherson is playing
the long game.

06:22.795 --> 06:24.929
Rewind it again.

06:27.566 --> 06:29.567
Again.
No.

06:29.634 --> 06:31.101
I don't want to watch
any more of that.

06:31.169 --> 06:33.437
I mean, look, I don't believe
that Claudia would--

06:33.506 --> 06:35.906
I mean, come on, Myka,
that can't be right.

06:35.973 --> 06:37.440
Look, I know it's hard, Pete,

06:37.508 --> 06:39.876
but it's right there in front of us.

06:39.944 --> 06:42.546
Okay, maybe MacPherson
did do something to her,

06:42.613 --> 06:44.080
but she's gone.

06:44.149 --> 06:46.517
She ran.

06:46.584 --> 06:48.952
Innocent people don't run.

06:56.662 --> 06:58.128
Whoa.

06:58.196 --> 06:59.796
Leena, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

06:59.864 --> 07:02.431
Yes.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.900
I--it's nothing.

07:07.204 --> 07:10.507
Leena, we got to replace
that umbilicus.

07:10.576 --> 07:12.777
I cannot do those stairs
15 times a day.

07:15.181 --> 07:16.881
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

07:16.948 --> 07:18.881
Claudia popped up on the grid.

07:18.949 --> 07:20.549
Looks like she's headed
to Switzerland.

07:20.617 --> 07:21.683
Wait.
Switzerland, why?

07:21.751 --> 07:23.552
To CERN, it's to CERN.

07:23.619 --> 07:25.253
It's that nuclear research
place where Joshua works.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.088
He is her only family.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.024
She's got no place else
left to go.

07:30.092 --> 07:31.926
And listen,

07:31.995 --> 07:34.029
if Claudia and Joshua are--

07:34.097 --> 07:35.297
No.

07:35.365 --> 07:36.932
If they are both working
for MacPherson--

07:37.000 --> 07:38.300
No, no, she's not.

07:38.369 --> 07:40.002
I know she's not,
and so do you, Artie.

07:40.070 --> 07:42.104
Pete, nobody wants
to believe it, all right?

07:42.172 --> 07:44.206
But that's irrelevant.

07:44.275 --> 07:48.212
Now, look, while I'm gone,
I want both of you--

07:48.280 --> 07:49.581
Wait, wait.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.648
You're going to CERN now?
Yes, of course.

07:51.716 --> 07:53.549
Then we're going with you.
You bet your ass.

07:53.617 --> 07:55.015
No, absolutely not.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.116
You have to go over this place
with a fine-toothed comb.

07:58.185 --> 08:02.354
MacPherson has had hours,
hours of unfettered access,

08:02.422 --> 08:05.457
and God only knows...

08:05.525 --> 08:08.027
What that man has done.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.697
So start in the bronze sector

08:10.765 --> 08:15.069
and retrace his steps,
and maybe, maybe...

08:15.137 --> 08:17.505
That will tell us
where he is right now.

08:17.573 --> 08:21.141
Artie, just be careful, okay?

08:21.210 --> 08:22.576
We don't know much,

08:22.644 --> 08:26.010
but we know that MacPherson
is out there, and...

08:26.079 --> 08:27.446
He already killed you once.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.383
Yeah.

08:32.452 --> 08:33.518
I got to go.

08:40.092 --> 08:41.726
This thing is useless, okay?

08:41.794 --> 08:43.861
I'm getting nothing.

08:43.929 --> 08:47.399
The durational spectrometer
only reads energy shadows

08:47.467 --> 08:50.168
from the last five hours.

08:50.236 --> 08:51.937
Aah!

08:52.005 --> 08:53.938
You okay?

08:54.006 --> 08:56.174
Yeah.
Yeah, I am now.

08:56.242 --> 08:57.476
Five hours ago,

08:57.543 --> 08:59.811
I would have screamed
like a little girl.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.480
Pete?
Yeah?

09:02.549 --> 09:04.516
Look at this.

09:07.754 --> 09:10.056
It looks like something heavy

09:10.124 --> 09:12.125
was dragged through here,

09:12.192 --> 09:15.561
something heavy
and something bronze.

09:15.629 --> 09:18.397
So what, you think
our Jimmy took a playdate?

09:18.465 --> 09:21.532
If there's a history log
in here, we could look up...

09:21.601 --> 09:23.402
There.

09:23.470 --> 09:26.101
This says that the debronze function

09:26.170 --> 09:27.670
was activated twice.

09:27.738 --> 09:29.938
Okay, so once for MacPherson,

09:30.006 --> 09:31.205
but who's our mystery guest?

09:31.274 --> 09:33.842
Well, let's...

09:38.180 --> 09:41.449
This place just gets
more interesting every day.

09:48.725 --> 09:51.226
I don't get it.

09:51.949 --> 09:53.182
Why H.G. Wells?

09:53.250 --> 09:54.850
What does MacPherson
want with him?

09:54.919 --> 09:56.386
And all I can find
on the bronze sector

09:56.454 --> 09:57.721
is a list of its residents,

09:57.788 --> 09:59.789
and H.G. Wells isn't even
on that list.

09:59.856 --> 10:01.023
Yeah, I mean,
if that place is reserved

10:01.091 --> 10:02.459
for the worst of the worst,

10:02.527 --> 10:04.096
what is Wells even doing in there?

10:04.163 --> 10:07.098
Maybe there's a clue
in one of Wells' books,

10:07.167 --> 10:10.370
because our library is amazing.

10:10.437 --> 10:11.670
I know, first editions

10:11.738 --> 10:13.305
of everything that's ever been printed.

10:13.374 --> 10:15.309
Does that include comic books?

10:15.376 --> 10:16.877
Really?
That's your first thought?

10:16.944 --> 10:19.412
No, but you definitely
wouldn't like my first thought.

10:19.481 --> 10:20.781
You're right.

10:20.849 --> 10:22.382
You know that my dad
used to read me H.G. Wells

10:22.450 --> 10:23.817
when I was a kid?

10:23.884 --> 10:25.584
<i>Yep, nothing like a little
war of the Worlds</i>

10:25.653 --> 10:27.220
to put a toddler to sleep.

10:27.288 --> 10:28.421
<i>You've read War of the Worlds?</i>

10:28.489 --> 10:30.856
Uh, no, but I saw the movie.

10:30.925 --> 10:33.159
Tom Cruise was awesome.

10:33.227 --> 10:36.295
<i>Oh, and Brando
in Island of Dr. Moreau--</i>

10:36.363 --> 10:39.231
I could've been a scientist.

10:39.299 --> 10:40.699
Great, great,
now all we need is Angelina

10:40.767 --> 10:42.033
<i>to do The Modern Utopia,</i>

10:42.101 --> 10:43.767
and you'll be all caught up.

10:43.836 --> 10:44.902
Yahtzee.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.270
It was broken into.
What was?

10:47.338 --> 10:49.372
The H.G. Wells Home Museum in London,

10:49.441 --> 10:50.707
three months ago.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.177
But interesting, nothing was taken.

10:53.244 --> 10:54.812
If you're looking for something
in H.G. Wells' house

10:54.880 --> 10:56.581
and you can't find it,

10:56.649 --> 10:58.749
why not ask H.G. Wells?

10:58.817 --> 11:00.618
MacPherson used Claudia

11:00.687 --> 11:02.988
to gain access to Wells.

11:03.056 --> 11:04.824
You watch, we're gonna
find out she's in the clear.

11:04.892 --> 11:06.192
Okay, let's go.

11:06.261 --> 11:07.360
Whoa, go where?

11:07.428 --> 11:08.694
To London.

11:08.762 --> 11:10.261
I got a vibe about this thing.

11:10.329 --> 11:11.928
I bet Wells is there.

11:11.996 --> 11:14.262
Let's go to London.
That's what I'm talking about.

11:21.771 --> 11:23.739
Joshua, thank God you're there.

11:23.806 --> 11:25.507
Where are you?
That doesn't look like, uh--

11:25.576 --> 11:27.343
Listen to me, okay,
you remember Professor Reynolds

11:27.411 --> 11:28.478
from college?

11:28.545 --> 11:29.879
Yeah, of course.

11:29.946 --> 11:32.714
Okay, his real name is MacPherson.

11:32.783 --> 11:34.450
What?
What are you--

11:34.518 --> 11:36.685
and he's actually--
Miss, you about done there?

11:36.754 --> 11:38.188
It's really complicated.

11:38.255 --> 11:39.689
They're gonna kick me off
this thing in sec.

11:39.756 --> 11:41.223
But listen,
if he tries to contact you,

11:41.291 --> 11:43.358
do not trust him, okay?

11:43.427 --> 11:45.261
He's a bad, bad guy.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.296
Maybe I am too.
I don't know.

11:47.364 --> 11:48.831
Claudia--

11:48.899 --> 11:51.434
Claud, what--what--
what's going on?

11:51.501 --> 11:53.035
I'll explain when I get there.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.770
Here?
You're gonna come to CERN?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.572
There's no place else
to go, okay?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.607
I can't go back to Artie,
and I'm not going back

11:58.674 --> 12:00.074
to the international house
of nutjobs.

12:00.143 --> 12:02.711
Joshua, are you busy?

12:02.779 --> 12:05.080
No, Dr. Lefevre,
please, uh, come in.

12:05.148 --> 12:07.015
I know I sound crazy.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.450
I'll see you soon.
Love you.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.018
Uh, yeah,
I love you too.

12:10.085 --> 12:13.086
Sorry, doctor.
That's, uh, my sister.

12:13.155 --> 12:15.756
Joshua, I'm going to be
raising your clearance level.

12:15.824 --> 12:18.625
I want your help removing
some material from the lab.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.662
Of course.
Yeah, doctor, anything you say.

12:25.741 --> 12:27.915
Docter?
- Show me the file.

12:29.511 --> 12:30.916
This is correct.

12:39.916 --> 12:43.417
Doctor.

12:52.828 --> 12:54.562
So is H.G. Wells
one of the Munsters?

12:54.630 --> 12:57.732
This place is a dump.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.767
How do you not have jet lag?
Because I slept on the plane.

13:00.836 --> 13:03.537
<i>I mean, how many times
can you watch Marley & Me?</i>

13:03.605 --> 13:04.872
It's so sad.

13:04.939 --> 13:06.573
Right, let's all gather round, shall we?

13:06.642 --> 13:08.009
We're going to get started.

13:08.076 --> 13:10.944
I told you we should've
had this place closed

13:11.012 --> 13:12.412
and locked down.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.382
No, no, that'd be like
shooting off a big flare--

13:14.449 --> 13:17.351
"hey, H.G., looky here,
we're waiting for you."

13:17.419 --> 13:19.520
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

13:19.588 --> 13:22.056
Hi.
Hello.

13:22.123 --> 13:25.291
Pete, we are working.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.160
Working it, okay?
You know how long it's been?

13:27.228 --> 13:28.628
Way too.

13:28.696 --> 13:30.830
There's no reason for me not
to get my groove on.

13:30.899 --> 13:32.399
Pete, look at this.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.135
Edward Prendick.

13:35.203 --> 13:38.904
I'll bet junior high
was fun for him, huh?

13:38.973 --> 13:40.873
<i>No, from
The Island of Dr. Moreau.</i>

13:40.941 --> 13:43.008
You would know him
as Marlon Brando.

13:43.077 --> 13:45.144
H.G. Is here.

13:45.212 --> 13:47.613
The actual inspiration
for the heat ray

13:47.681 --> 13:49.482
came from a tour
of Big Ben I was given

13:49.549 --> 13:51.116
by her Majesty Victoria--

13:51.184 --> 13:53.352
lovely woman, terrible breath.

13:55.222 --> 13:57.289
<i>Well, you got to admit,
this guy's got some cojones.</i>

13:57.357 --> 13:58.691
Pete, wait.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.325
All right, Wells, show's over.

14:00.394 --> 14:03.129
I beg your pardon.
Sorry, ma'am.

14:03.197 --> 14:05.365
Government business...

14:05.433 --> 14:07.034
United States Secret Service.

14:07.102 --> 14:08.736
Well, you don't look
like much of a threat to me,

14:08.803 --> 14:10.571
but if MacPherson wants you out,
then we want you in.

14:10.638 --> 14:11.705
Now let's go.

14:11.774 --> 14:14.042
How dare you?
Take your hands off me.

14:14.110 --> 14:15.276
You two, I thought
you might be trouble,

14:15.344 --> 14:17.145
coming in late.
Ma'am, we apologize.

14:17.213 --> 14:18.580
No, we don't.
Yes, we do, Pete.

14:18.648 --> 14:20.682
He's an impersonator.
No, we don't know that.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.018
The best place to hide
is right out in the open.

14:23.087 --> 14:24.987
He has a fake mustache.

14:29.394 --> 14:30.694
All right?

14:30.762 --> 14:33.263
Name's Walter Frith.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.767
Americans.
H.G. Wells died in 1946.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.603
Myka, I am really
vibing out here, okay?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.037
And I don't like it.

14:40.105 --> 14:41.973
Uh, ma'am, can I speak
with you outside, please?

14:42.041 --> 14:45.644
Yes, I'd like to speak with you.

16:03.191 --> 16:05.426
Artie?
What the hell?

16:05.494 --> 16:08.096
You're fired.

16:14.618 --> 16:17.889
We're really very sorry
about this.

16:18.668 --> 16:20.469
You can come back tomorrow.
Thank you.

16:20.536 --> 16:22.504
Yep, sorry, guys.
Sorry, sorry.

16:22.572 --> 16:24.740
Thank you, thank you.
Nice jacket.

16:24.807 --> 16:26.975
Hey, yeah, sorry
about the mustache thing.

16:27.043 --> 16:29.244
It was--okay.

16:29.312 --> 16:31.113
Okay, so if nobody in this group

16:31.180 --> 16:33.114
signed in as Edward Prendick,

16:33.182 --> 16:35.283
that means that Wells
must have come and gone already.

16:35.352 --> 16:37.119
All right, so maybe
we can find out what he took.

16:37.187 --> 16:38.454
Hey, uh...

16:38.521 --> 16:41.189
So, uh, what'd you say
to Mary Poppins, anyway?

16:41.258 --> 16:44.093
Oh, I just told her
that you were a mental patient

16:44.161 --> 16:45.894
who thought he was
Wells' long-lost boyfriend.

16:45.962 --> 16:48.696
No, you didn't.

16:50.266 --> 16:53.000
Did you?

16:53.068 --> 16:55.369
Nice.

16:55.437 --> 16:57.839
That's not even funny.

16:57.907 --> 17:01.445
Do you think that he could
still be using her somehow?

17:01.514 --> 17:03.381
There's my access
of just of few moments ago.

17:03.449 --> 17:06.352
Let me just toggle back
to see the last person.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.988
This place is my home.
I would never do anything--

17:11.057 --> 17:12.758
Claudia, I'm sorry.

17:12.826 --> 17:16.962
I would never do
anything to hurt any of you.

17:28.175 --> 17:31.212
That's probably
why they bronzed him--

17:31.279 --> 17:33.781
Neanderthals.

17:46.396 --> 17:47.496
Yah!

17:47.564 --> 17:50.065
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, man, no--

17:50.133 --> 17:51.467
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

17:51.535 --> 17:52.968
I didn't think anyone was still here.

17:53.037 --> 17:54.937
I didn't know it was you,
and I'm--I'm sorry.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.975
No, no, no,
I do beg your pardon.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.679
I seem to have left
my notebook here.

18:01.746 --> 18:03.180
Yeah.
We left in such a hurry.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.749
Right, yeah, that was--
that was kind of our fault,

18:05.818 --> 18:08.086
so I'm really sorry.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.521
I'll just come back--

18:09.589 --> 18:11.190
no, no, no, no.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.859
Uh, let me help you out here.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.962
You know,
hands across the water

18:16.030 --> 18:17.965
and all that.

18:18.032 --> 18:20.067
Well, that is
very sweet of you.

18:20.135 --> 18:22.169
Some Americans
really are quite nice.

18:22.238 --> 18:24.272
Well, for a Brit,
you ain't half bad yourself.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.907
What? What?

18:28.278 --> 18:30.412
If I had a Farnsworth,
you easily could have called me.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.617
Why call when I can fly
5,000 miles in coach?

18:34.685 --> 18:36.186
What did you hit me with?

18:36.253 --> 18:38.254
Nothing.
My hand.

18:38.322 --> 18:39.756
What are you doing here,
anyway?

18:39.825 --> 18:41.392
If I'm some kind of freaky
double Agent, I have to be--

18:41.460 --> 18:42.893
okay, first,
are you planning on running

18:42.961 --> 18:44.195
for the rest of your life?

18:44.263 --> 18:45.496
Because that's
what it's gonna take

18:45.565 --> 18:46.732
to get me off your back.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.934
I'm sorry.
I needed to see Joshua.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.703
I needed to see somebody
who knows me.

18:50.770 --> 18:53.939
And second,
why can't you just trust me?

18:54.007 --> 18:55.174
I'm kind of smart.

18:55.242 --> 18:57.543
Maybe the two of us
could figure this out.

19:00.647 --> 19:02.214
And I know you too, kiddo.

19:02.282 --> 19:05.150
So you--you think maybe
I'm not a double Agent.

19:05.218 --> 19:06.919
I think maybe
I could take the risk.

19:06.987 --> 19:08.556
Don't make me regret it.

19:08.624 --> 19:10.725
Okay.
'Cause I'm not, you know?

19:10.793 --> 19:12.060
We'll see.
Ah.

19:12.128 --> 19:13.395
That was not your hand.

19:13.463 --> 19:14.996
No, it wasn't.

19:15.064 --> 19:17.733
Okay, first thing,
we have to make sure

19:17.801 --> 19:19.735
Professor Reynolds
hasn't gotten to Joshua.

19:19.803 --> 19:21.537
I figure if he got to me,
he might try to go for Josh--

19:21.606 --> 19:22.572
MacPherson is Reynolds.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.107
Yeah, you already know that.

19:24.175 --> 19:26.143
I know I know it, but
I didn't really think about it,

19:26.210 --> 19:29.012
because when the position
first came up at CERN,

19:29.081 --> 19:30.514
the Director mentioned
the name Reynolds.

19:30.582 --> 19:31.616
No!
Yes.

19:31.683 --> 19:32.784
I didn't know at the time

19:32.851 --> 19:34.419
that MacPherson was Reynolds.

19:34.487 --> 19:36.755
That's what she meant by,
"he's playing the long game."

19:36.823 --> 19:38.323
We have to get
to CERN immediately.

19:38.391 --> 19:40.792
That's what I've been saying.

19:44.765 --> 19:47.233
I'm, uh--
I'm Pete, by the way.

19:47.302 --> 19:49.003
Helena.

19:49.070 --> 19:50.771
You know,
I-I think our two countries

19:50.839 --> 19:53.774
might be able to work out
their differences.

19:53.843 --> 19:58.213
I'd say we're well
on our way to detente.

20:00.985 --> 20:03.119
Fill me in.

20:03.188 --> 20:05.523
Well, hello to you too.
W-where are you?

20:05.590 --> 20:07.858
Geneva.
Fill me in.

20:07.926 --> 20:09.326
We're--we're in London.

20:09.395 --> 20:10.862
I told you to stay
at the warehouse.

20:10.930 --> 20:12.797
Will there ever come a time
when the two of you,

20:12.865 --> 20:15.367
anyone for that matter,
does as they are told?

20:15.435 --> 20:18.003
Artie, look, MacPherson
debronzed H.G. Wells.

20:18.071 --> 20:20.239
What?

20:23.711 --> 20:25.912
Wait.

20:25.980 --> 20:29.349
Is everything all right?
No, no.

20:29.417 --> 20:31.285
I got a really bad feeling.

20:31.353 --> 20:33.287
Pete!

20:33.356 --> 20:35.090
Pete!
In here.

20:35.157 --> 20:38.026
Pete, Artie says
that H.G. Wells is actually--

20:39.963 --> 20:41.997
a woman...

20:42.065 --> 20:43.399
A really hot woman,

20:43.466 --> 20:45.534
maybe, uh, good with a gun.

20:45.603 --> 20:49.772
Yeah, he left out the gun part.

20:49.840 --> 20:54.077
Okay, so, uh, H.G. Wells
is actually a woman.

20:54.145 --> 20:55.746
I'm gonna have to process this.

20:55.813 --> 20:58.048
Yeah, well,
make it fast, will you?

20:58.116 --> 21:01.085
And could you please be careful
with that, okay?

21:01.153 --> 21:03.020
It's a Tesla,
and up close it just might be--

21:03.089 --> 21:04.556
lethal.

21:04.623 --> 21:06.791
I know all about it.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.161
I brought it to the warehouse.

21:08.228 --> 21:09.863
You what?

21:09.931 --> 21:11.599
I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.301
Nikola Tesla and I met
at the Chicago world fair

21:14.369 --> 21:16.102
in 1893.

21:17.873 --> 21:20.842
You are rocking my world, lady.

21:20.911 --> 21:22.344
Perhaps you'd like to tell me

21:22.412 --> 21:23.812
why you're ransacking my home.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.381
Ransacking your home.

21:25.448 --> 21:28.884
Well, that has
a distinctive ringtone to it.

21:30.087 --> 21:33.290
What does that mean?

21:33.358 --> 21:36.660
Oh, oh, it's, uh--
it's an American expression

21:36.728 --> 21:38.362
that means...

21:38.431 --> 21:39.965
"Gotcha."

21:40.033 --> 21:42.034
♪ "C" is for cookie ♪

21:42.102 --> 21:43.536
♪ that's good enough for me ♪

21:43.604 --> 21:45.071
I'll take that.

21:45.140 --> 21:48.575
I'd hate to have to hit
a sweet, old Victorian lady.

21:48.643 --> 21:51.278
I, on the other hand,
have no problem shooting one.

21:51.346 --> 21:52.346
♪ Good enough for me ♪

21:52.414 --> 21:53.915
♪ oh, cookie, cookie, cookie ♪

21:53.982 --> 21:56.517
♪ starts with "c" ♪

21:56.586 --> 21:59.488
You know,
that was just rude.

21:59.555 --> 22:01.990
I thought English people
were supposed to be polite.

22:02.058 --> 22:04.292
Why are you protecting
James MacPherson?

22:04.361 --> 22:05.528
He tried to kill the both of us,

22:05.596 --> 22:07.830
and believe me,
he will turn on you.

22:07.898 --> 22:09.966
Don't they all?
Who?

22:10.034 --> 22:12.469
Men...
Eventually.

22:12.537 --> 22:13.837
Neanderthals.

22:13.905 --> 22:15.138
You know, for somebody
who's been unconscious

22:15.207 --> 22:16.774
for 100 years,

22:16.842 --> 22:18.042
you've really held on to some anger.

22:18.110 --> 22:20.544
Not unconscious...

22:20.613 --> 22:21.680
Just immobile.

22:21.748 --> 22:24.082
Oh, right.

22:24.150 --> 22:26.151
What? You mean
while you're bronzed,

22:26.220 --> 22:28.487
you're awake?

22:28.555 --> 22:30.089
We didn't know that.

22:30.157 --> 22:32.191
Offers a lady time to think.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.894
So what did you come here for?

22:33.962 --> 22:36.296
Yeah, look, you either tell us
what and where it is

22:36.364 --> 22:37.798
or watch us tear
this whole place apart

22:37.865 --> 22:38.899
looking for it.

22:42.838 --> 22:45.072
Pull out the second drawer
down on the right.

22:47.343 --> 22:48.710
Empty it out.

22:48.778 --> 22:50.078
Turn it over.

22:50.147 --> 22:52.682
Pull open the panel on the back.

22:57.189 --> 22:58.422
What's this?

22:58.490 --> 23:02.593
Go over to the bottom set
of shutters.

23:06.432 --> 23:08.764
Grasp the top inner vents
on each side

23:08.833 --> 23:10.664
and close them simultaneously.

23:10.732 --> 23:13.700
<i>UN, deux, trois.</i>

23:13.769 --> 23:15.369
<i>Et voila.</i>

23:19.240 --> 23:20.640
That will show you
the hiding place

23:20.709 --> 23:23.944
Mr. MacPherson
had so much trouble locating.

23:24.012 --> 23:26.012
Here we go.

23:35.824 --> 23:37.559
Oh!

23:37.627 --> 23:39.995
"Put the candle back."

23:41.598 --> 23:43.065
<i>Young Frankenstein.</i>

23:44.669 --> 23:46.036
Never mind.

23:46.103 --> 23:47.571
Okay, just keep her covered, Pete.

23:57.818 --> 24:01.854
So do you want to tell us
about this?

24:01.923 --> 24:03.456
It's a family heirloom.

24:03.524 --> 24:04.657
Right.

24:04.725 --> 24:05.992
Why did MacPherson want it?

24:06.059 --> 24:08.127
I have no idea.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.930
Pete, the--the wiring
on the vest

24:09.997 --> 24:11.932
matches the wiring
on the switch.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.233
Yeah, the wiring on the vest

24:13.301 --> 24:14.802
matches the wiring
on the switch.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.905
That has nothing to do
with the vest.

24:16.973 --> 24:18.840
Oh, of course we believe you.
Yeah, right.

24:18.908 --> 24:20.208
Why wouldn't we?
You want to do the honors?

24:20.277 --> 24:22.478
I do.

24:34.950 --> 24:38.113
Oh, what the hell?

24:41.927 --> 24:44.694
Thank goodness these things
haven't changed much.

24:44.638 --> 24:46.838
How come you're not affected?

24:46.906 --> 24:48.773
Oh, magnetic boots...

24:48.841 --> 24:50.074
Specially made.

24:50.143 --> 24:53.612
That explains
why my head still hurts.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.314
I guess we know now
why they bronzed you.

24:56.382 --> 24:59.117
Don't speculate upon things
about which you know nothing.

24:59.185 --> 25:02.418
Ooh, there's that anger again.

25:02.487 --> 25:04.886
Well, there must be some
reason why they bronzed you.

25:04.954 --> 25:07.722
The world was a different place.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.557
A century ago,
it was easier to believe

25:09.625 --> 25:11.159
in the possibility
of a time machine

25:11.226 --> 25:13.861
than in the reality
that a woman thought one up.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.263
Well, if you wrote those novels,

25:15.331 --> 25:17.532
then--then who was H.G. Wells?

25:17.600 --> 25:20.703
My brother Charles was the writer.

25:24.785 --> 25:28.729
I supplied the ideas, the research.

25:28.798 --> 25:31.199
Charles supplied the mustache.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.538
Oh, hey, I'm, uh, digging
the iron vest, by the way.

25:34.606 --> 25:36.106
It really brings out your eyes.

25:36.174 --> 25:38.074
Who's angry now?

25:42.148 --> 25:46.783
So do, uh, all your dates
work out this way?

25:46.852 --> 25:49.886
On a scale of one to ten,
I'm giving this one a seven.

25:55.093 --> 25:57.428
Is this Joshua's department?

25:57.496 --> 25:59.164
The antimatter storage facility

25:59.231 --> 26:00.565
is part of this building
somewhere.

26:00.633 --> 26:02.734
I just--I don't know where.
This place is huge.

26:24.257 --> 26:26.257
Josh!
Joshua!

26:26.326 --> 26:27.459
Claud--Claudia.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.867
Wait a minute.

26:36.939 --> 26:39.407
What? I'm a what?
Claudia! Get off me.

26:39.475 --> 26:41.242
Joshua, are you all right?

26:41.310 --> 26:42.576
Claudia, what's happening?

26:42.645 --> 26:44.579
Joshua, give me the briefcase.

26:44.647 --> 26:45.680
Claudia, his hand.

26:45.748 --> 26:47.881
Look at his hand!

26:52.320 --> 26:54.187
Thanks for all your help.

26:55.390 --> 26:58.326
Joshua!

26:58.394 --> 26:59.827
Joshua!

27:03.566 --> 27:04.966
I'll admit it,

27:05.034 --> 27:06.968
I thought she was hot,

27:07.036 --> 27:10.271
but she's also obviously a--

27:10.339 --> 27:12.273
Cavorite.

27:12.342 --> 27:14.976
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure she was that too.

27:15.044 --> 27:17.078
No, Cavorite was--
was an anti-gravity metal

27:17.146 --> 27:19.046
that Wells wrote about,

27:19.115 --> 27:20.915
but Cavorite doesn't exist.

27:20.983 --> 27:22.550
I mean, there's no such thing.

27:22.618 --> 27:24.585
Myka, in this job

27:24.654 --> 27:26.221
there's no such thing
as no such thing.

27:26.289 --> 27:28.956
We just met the female H.G. Wells,

27:29.024 --> 27:30.491
for crying out loud.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.261
Good point.

27:32.328 --> 27:34.096
So how do we shut down Cavorite?

27:34.163 --> 27:36.732
Maybe she ran some sort
of electric current through it

27:36.800 --> 27:38.534
to increase its properties.

27:38.602 --> 27:41.738
Right.
What the hell, then?

27:41.805 --> 27:43.706
What?
What are you doing?

27:43.775 --> 27:44.942
I'm fighting fire with fire.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.944
What?

27:47.011 --> 27:49.446
If I can just

27:49.515 --> 27:53.384
ram the Tesla into this--

27:53.452 --> 27:54.585
hold on.

27:54.654 --> 27:56.054
Or--or--or don't.

28:04.498 --> 28:06.599
That's a high ceiling.

28:06.667 --> 28:09.069
Yeah.

28:09.136 --> 28:10.637
Artie.
We have a problem.

28:10.705 --> 28:11.838
Yeah, Artie, so do we.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.141
She got away.

28:13.209 --> 28:15.777
Yeah, she took off in this--
I don't know--

28:15.845 --> 28:17.279
cool, iron, steampunky vest thing.

28:17.346 --> 28:19.481
It looked more like an artifact
than a fashion choice.

28:19.550 --> 28:21.084
He's fine. He's fine.
Come here. Come here.

28:21.152 --> 28:22.386
Hack in.

28:22.453 --> 28:24.288
Run a search
on H.G. Wells' inventions,

28:24.357 --> 28:25.656
specifically those
not in the warehouse.

28:25.724 --> 28:26.857
On it.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.092
Now listen--
Artie, is that Claudia?

28:28.159 --> 28:29.359
Is she okay?
Where did you find her?

28:29.427 --> 28:31.225
Guys, I'm okay.
Joshua broke his leg.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.794
Everybody stop!

28:32.861 --> 28:34.696
Bigger fish.

28:34.764 --> 28:36.865
Now, did you actually talk
to H.G. Wells?

28:36.933 --> 28:37.934
What is she up to?

28:38.002 --> 28:39.069
She?
Later!

28:39.136 --> 28:40.804
She really wasn't very talkative.

28:40.872 --> 28:42.472
Artie, did you know
that when you're bronzed,

28:42.541 --> 28:44.141
you can still think?

28:44.209 --> 28:46.210
Yes.
All right, check it.

28:46.277 --> 28:48.878
The Imperceptor Vest.

28:48.947 --> 28:51.949
Wearer can move fast enough
to be imperceptible

28:52.016 --> 28:53.917
to the naked eye.
I don't know.

28:53.986 --> 28:55.853
She had it on.
Nothing happened.

28:55.921 --> 28:57.154
I would've thought
she'd have used it.

28:57.222 --> 28:58.422
Well, is it operational?

28:58.490 --> 28:59.891
Accor--according
to the schematics,

28:59.959 --> 29:02.194
it needs a small
but very powerful energy source.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.531
Which wouldn't have existed
100 years ago.

29:04.599 --> 29:05.765
She probably could find one now.

29:05.834 --> 29:06.934
Yeah.

29:07.002 --> 29:08.836
Like, for instance, antimatter.

29:08.904 --> 29:10.771
I still don't understand
why she needs the vest.

29:10.838 --> 29:12.205
The Escher vault.

29:12.274 --> 29:13.741
That's why they need
the antimatter,

29:13.809 --> 29:15.242
to power the vest to get
through the Escher vault.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.544
And what is the Escher vault?

29:16.612 --> 29:17.845
It's where
the personal effects are kept

29:17.914 --> 29:19.181
of anyone who's been bronzed.

29:19.249 --> 29:20.549
And to get through that,

29:20.617 --> 29:22.451
she would need something
like the imperceptor.

29:22.519 --> 29:23.485
So where's the vault?

29:23.554 --> 29:26.055
It's in the warehouse.

29:26.122 --> 29:27.923
They're going
back to the warehouse.

29:27.991 --> 29:29.257
He knew we would follow him.

29:29.325 --> 29:31.526
He wants the warehouse empty.
You stupid--

29:31.595 --> 29:33.295
Artie, if Claudia's not the breach,

29:33.363 --> 29:35.231
and it's obvious
that you don't think she is,

29:35.299 --> 29:38.167
then that leaves only--
Leena.

29:47.482 --> 29:49.484
Mrs. Frederic...

29:49.551 --> 29:50.619
You're here.

29:50.686 --> 29:52.687
So it would appear.

29:52.755 --> 29:54.722
Are you all right?

29:54.791 --> 29:57.025
I thought you were supposed
to be in the hospital.

29:57.093 --> 29:59.260
When the explosion happened,
where were you exactly?

30:02.632 --> 30:05.300
I was at the warehouse.

30:05.369 --> 30:07.904
You don't remember.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.405
You've been having lapses...

30:09.473 --> 30:11.174
Blackouts?

30:11.243 --> 30:15.413
Sometimes you even wake up
in a different place.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.714
How do you know that?

30:16.782 --> 30:18.282
Look at me.

30:24.892 --> 30:25.992
What was that?

30:26.060 --> 30:27.193
As I suspected.

31:08.532 --> 31:09.566
Drink this.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.635
Not too much.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.207
What is it?

31:15.275 --> 31:16.475
Absinthe.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.578
You tried to kill me.

31:18.647 --> 31:20.714
Yeah, sorry about that,

31:20.782 --> 31:22.116
but I had no choice.

31:22.184 --> 31:25.954
There's no other way
to remove the pearl.

31:26.023 --> 31:27.523
The pearl?

31:27.591 --> 31:29.692
What are you--
what are you talking about?

31:29.761 --> 31:31.629
The pearl of wisdom.

31:31.697 --> 31:35.432
MacPherson must have planted it
in your inner ear weeks ago.

31:35.501 --> 31:38.936
Do you recall a night
when you had bad dreams?

31:39.004 --> 31:41.005
Yes...

31:41.073 --> 31:43.874
Yes, over a month ago,
horrible nightmares.

31:43.942 --> 31:46.610
That was the pearl
attaching itself.

31:46.679 --> 31:49.081
If a person uses it properly,

31:49.148 --> 31:52.251
they can control
your thoughts and movements.

31:52.318 --> 31:54.186
No, but the tape.

31:54.255 --> 31:56.824
It was Claudia
who debronzed MacPherson.

31:56.892 --> 31:59.760
Think.
See it clearly now.

32:09.171 --> 32:11.068
Harriet Tubman's thimble.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.768
It was me?

32:12.836 --> 32:14.035
Mrs. Frederic, it was me.

32:24.214 --> 32:27.449
It's done.

32:27.516 --> 32:29.150
Why are you wearing those beads?

32:29.219 --> 32:30.585
Well, if I remove them,

32:30.653 --> 32:32.587
my blood will eat
through my own veins.

32:32.655 --> 32:35.356
Little gift from an old friend.

32:35.425 --> 32:37.594
We have to assume
they're not too far behind us.

32:37.661 --> 32:38.962
Not to worry.

32:39.030 --> 32:40.931
I've created a few diversions,
just in case.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.369
There.

32:43.436 --> 32:46.038
The antimatter's attached.

32:46.106 --> 32:49.207
Let's see if this works
or if it kills me, shall we?

32:59.854 --> 33:01.755
Behind you.

33:01.823 --> 33:03.891
Oh. I'm impressed.

33:03.959 --> 33:07.495
I'm so pleased it didn't kill you.

33:17.540 --> 33:19.107
That seemed very easy.

33:19.175 --> 33:20.475
Well, access to the Escher vault

33:20.543 --> 33:21.576
is not the issue.

33:21.644 --> 33:23.011
20 years ago, a curious Agent

33:23.079 --> 33:25.547
entered the vault
and hasn't been heard of since.

33:25.615 --> 33:28.149
I do hope you don't run into him.

33:35.125 --> 33:36.825
We're taking the long way around.

33:36.893 --> 33:39.093
MacPherson will expect us
to take the most direct route.

33:39.161 --> 33:40.361
How'd we beat
Pete and Myka back?

33:40.430 --> 33:41.830
Something to do
with the destruction

33:41.898 --> 33:43.231
of historical landmarks--
I spoke to Scotland Yard.

33:43.299 --> 33:44.265
Anyway, you left the packet
out for them, right?

33:44.333 --> 33:45.533
On your desk.

33:45.601 --> 33:47.102
Why do MacPherson and Wells
need the vest?

33:47.170 --> 33:48.637
Because the Escher vault
is a maze

33:48.704 --> 33:50.572
of stairs and walkways,
constantly rapidly moving.

33:50.639 --> 33:51.906
If you don't have a way
to navigate it,

33:51.975 --> 33:53.375
you'd be lost in there
for a lifetime.

33:53.443 --> 33:54.676
Now, if Wells
can figure out a way

33:54.744 --> 33:56.144
to make the vest operational,

33:56.212 --> 33:57.880
she can move quickly enough
to get right through it.

33:57.948 --> 34:00.050
So what if we
deactivate everything--

34:00.117 --> 34:02.486
Claudia, I can either
run or lecture.

34:02.554 --> 34:03.520
I cannot do both.

34:03.588 --> 34:07.290
This is running?

34:07.359 --> 34:10.594
Wait.

34:10.663 --> 34:12.197
Something is off.

34:12.264 --> 34:13.866
How can you tell?

34:13.934 --> 34:15.199
Take a whiff.

34:15.268 --> 34:17.202
Fudge.

34:21.641 --> 34:24.510
Right there.

34:27.414 --> 34:28.746
Boom goes the dynamite.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.184
Yeah.
Chameleon mines.

34:31.251 --> 34:33.186
They blend into the landscape
so you can't see them.

34:33.253 --> 34:34.655
MacPherson.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.626
Yeah, we're gonna have
to find an alternate route.

34:38.262 --> 34:39.295
Wait.

34:39.362 --> 34:40.429
Again?
I don't smell Fudge.

34:40.498 --> 34:41.665
I have to think like him.

34:41.733 --> 34:42.866
He knew I would make it
this far.

34:42.934 --> 34:44.601
He knew I would test it,

34:44.668 --> 34:47.837
and he will expect me
to turn around, so...

34:49.873 --> 34:51.041
Wait.

34:51.109 --> 34:52.676
Now you've got me doing it.

34:52.745 --> 34:53.779
Look.

34:53.847 --> 34:55.681
Dante's death mask.
So?

34:55.748 --> 34:57.283
So I do a lot of inventory.

34:57.350 --> 34:59.385
It doesn't belong there.

35:08.196 --> 35:09.864
Nice catch.

35:09.932 --> 35:11.566
How come it didn't go off before?

35:11.634 --> 35:12.934
Because we triggered it
on the way through.

35:13.001 --> 35:14.902
He wants to box us in,
and he's done that.

35:14.970 --> 35:17.470
Okay, well, the flames
only go up eight rows.

35:17.539 --> 35:19.273
All we have to do
is climb 20,

35:19.340 --> 35:20.807
run across the top,
and climb down.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.108
All we have to do?

35:22.177 --> 35:23.744
On the upside,
you'll be able to work off

35:23.812 --> 35:25.245
some of those extra pounds
you've been griping about.

35:25.313 --> 35:28.815
Devil child.

35:28.884 --> 35:31.018
When do I get one of those?
Two weeks after never.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.352
Artie, what's going on?

35:32.420 --> 35:34.221
Great, you're back.
Now listen to me.

35:34.290 --> 35:37.158
Do not deviate one iota

35:37.226 --> 35:39.428
from what
I'm about to tell you.

35:39.496 --> 35:40.997
Got it, Artie.
We're on our way.

35:41.065 --> 35:42.398
Wait, wait.

35:42.466 --> 35:43.867
This place is full of booby traps.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.569
You're gonna have to take
a long, circuitous route.

35:46.638 --> 35:48.705
Aside from that, hurry!

35:48.773 --> 35:50.473
Or...

35:52.343 --> 35:54.310
Yeah.

35:54.378 --> 35:55.878
Hey, if you're
gonna grab me like that,

35:55.946 --> 35:58.447
I need some sweet talk.
Just shut up and drive.

36:05.892 --> 36:08.762
Watch out!
You are going hit that, okay?

36:08.830 --> 36:09.965
It should be me driving right now.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.169
Would you just let me steer?

36:11.237 --> 36:13.107
Or that.

36:13.175 --> 36:15.610
That--that works too.

36:22.922 --> 36:23.822
Ah.

36:23.890 --> 36:24.990
Did you get it?

36:25.058 --> 36:26.559
Mission accomplished.

36:26.627 --> 36:28.728
Where's the vest?

36:28.797 --> 36:30.664
Left it behind.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.833
It was spent.

36:32.902 --> 36:35.434
All said and done,
it wasn't terribly difficult.

36:35.502 --> 36:38.001
Hmm.

36:38.068 --> 36:40.368
Before we go,

36:40.436 --> 36:42.336
should we celebrate?

36:42.404 --> 36:45.405
What exactly
did you have in mind?

36:45.474 --> 36:48.743
Oh. You really are
the most unpredictable woman.

36:53.015 --> 36:54.248
Took you long enough.

36:54.316 --> 36:55.916
I thought I was gonna
have to kiss that.

37:00.655 --> 37:02.188
Game over, huh?

37:02.256 --> 37:06.958
So a long way to go
for nothing, eh, James?

37:07.027 --> 37:08.861
We still have
some bargaining left.

37:08.929 --> 37:12.765
Wells is still in the vault, Arthur.

37:12.833 --> 37:14.602
I know what the plan is.
Let me go.

37:14.670 --> 37:15.838
I'll tell you everything.

37:15.906 --> 37:17.740
I'm disappointed
but not surprised.

37:24.214 --> 37:25.748
James. James.

37:29.787 --> 37:32.552
I knew you'd use it.

37:32.621 --> 37:34.956
Use--

37:35.023 --> 37:36.857
the Phoenix?

37:36.925 --> 37:38.859
You put it in my pocket.

37:38.927 --> 37:40.995
I wanted you to see
what I saw--

37:41.063 --> 37:43.364
the darkness,

37:43.431 --> 37:45.699
the emptiness,

37:45.768 --> 37:47.268
that it's all for nothing.

37:47.336 --> 37:49.470
No, James, I saw light...

37:49.538 --> 37:52.406
And peace.
I felt nothing but hope.

37:52.475 --> 37:55.310
Hope?
Yeah.

37:55.378 --> 37:58.145
But all this time,
I thought...

37:58.214 --> 38:00.382
I knew the truth.

38:03.954 --> 38:06.723
I'm sorry, Arthur.

38:19.317 --> 38:20.317
So she's gone.

38:20.368 --> 38:22.301
There's absolutely
no trace of her.

38:22.530 --> 38:23.697
None.

38:23.765 --> 38:25.434
I found the vest outside.

38:25.501 --> 38:26.902
So is she dangerous?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.371
I mean, do we really
need to find her?

38:28.439 --> 38:30.573
Yes, and absolutely.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.842
Can't just have H.G. Wells
wandering around the world.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.178
No, no, no, no, no.

38:34.246 --> 38:36.547
We let her out,
got to put her back.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.415
That was completely different.
That is so disgusting.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.318
You're acting like
I did this on purpose.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.287
Totally not true.

38:42.355 --> 38:43.989
If anybody should be
shell-shocked about this,

38:44.058 --> 38:45.058
I think it should be me.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.192
I don't see it that way,

38:46.259 --> 38:47.226
since I was the victim here.

38:47.294 --> 38:48.261
You?

38:48.328 --> 38:49.495
You were the victim?

38:49.563 --> 38:50.530
Yeah.

38:50.599 --> 38:51.932
Glad you're seeing it my way.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.734
You wanted to talk to me
about something?

38:54.801 --> 38:57.633
Claudia, go easy.

38:57.702 --> 38:59.102
We've all been through a lot.

38:59.169 --> 39:01.904
Worst case
of identity theft ever.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.906
All right.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.808
Maybe this will help.

39:11.581 --> 39:14.615
No way.

39:14.684 --> 39:16.452
Does this mean
I'm an Agent now?

39:16.519 --> 39:18.354
No, it means I can reach you
any time of day or night.

39:18.421 --> 39:19.655
Okay, not as good.

39:19.723 --> 39:21.325
Just be careful.
It belonged to philo.

39:21.394 --> 39:23.428
"Philo" as in
philo Farnsworth?

39:23.495 --> 39:26.530
She gets Farnsworth's
Farnsworth?

39:26.599 --> 39:28.833
Artie.
Yeah, I--don't lose it.

39:28.901 --> 39:30.602
Okay.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.269
I--thanks.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.406
Thank you
for coming after me.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.341
Yeah.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.748
Okay, why is everybody hugging
all the time around here?

39:43.816 --> 39:45.483
I still have a bump
on my head, you know?

39:45.551 --> 39:47.785
Okay.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.053
Jealous?

39:49.121 --> 39:50.689
Not even close.
You sure?

39:50.757 --> 39:51.991
Not even.
Really?

39:52.059 --> 39:53.459
Let me just see it.
No, I don't think so.

39:53.527 --> 39:54.994
I just want to see it.
You're gonna have to Chase me.

39:55.061 --> 39:56.328
Come here, you.
No.

39:56.397 --> 39:58.431
Give Chase,
Pete Lattimer.

39:58.499 --> 40:00.599
Whoa! Look out!

40:00.667 --> 40:04.369
Let's see what H.G. took,
shall we?

40:08.810 --> 40:11.845
How do you remember
that password?

40:11.913 --> 40:15.682
I do a lot
of crossword puzzles.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.351
Ah.

40:26.324 --> 40:29.592
How do we navigate
once we're in there?

40:29.659 --> 40:32.126
That's the trick,
isn't it?

40:32.195 --> 40:36.197
They needed to use
the Imperceptor Vest.

40:36.265 --> 40:38.132
We've got other options.

40:51.114 --> 40:52.380
Put these on.

40:52.448 --> 40:54.315
Don't take them off
under any circumstances.

41:08.395 --> 41:12.064
Okay, this is amazing.

41:29.082 --> 41:31.483
What did I say?
Sorry.

42:02.348 --> 42:05.216
Ah, look, there are
a few items missing--

42:05.284 --> 42:08.652
her locket, her ring...

42:10.523 --> 42:13.857
And her compact.

42:13.926 --> 42:15.727
But why?

42:15.794 --> 42:17.461
Why indeed?

42:40.053 --> 42:41.053
hey.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.121
What you working on there?

42:45.491 --> 42:48.759
Something I've been thinking
about for a very long time.
