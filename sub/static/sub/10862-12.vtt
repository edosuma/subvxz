00:32.360 --> 00:34.200
Hey, you did this
yourself?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.720
All right, Dave.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.720
What are you,
like, sick?

00:37.720 --> 00:39.200
He must want
something.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.720
Whatever it is,
forget it.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.200
You OK?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.800
I'm fine.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.000
Why don't you
just tell them?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.520
What's the matter?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.640
Poor Davy upset
about something?

00:54.640 --> 00:55.720
That's why.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.120
That's why.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.720
What's going on?

00:59.720 --> 01:01.240
His family moved
across town,

01:01.240 --> 01:03.240
and he had to
change schools.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.760
Oh, poor baby

01:04.760 --> 01:06.680
doesn't like
being the new kid.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.240
If you think
it's funny,

01:11.240 --> 01:13.120
why don't you
try changing schools?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.760
You don't know anybody.
You get lost.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.560
The kids treat you
like you're invisible

01:17.560 --> 01:19.360
because they already have
their own friends.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.000
If that means
I'm being a baby,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.720
then I guess
I'm being a baby.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.920
It will get better.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.400
Yeah. You'll
get used to it.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.240
I figured I might as well
make the best of this,

01:35.240 --> 01:37.720
so I came up
with a story.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.720
Now you're talking.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.200
It's about two kids
who have to go to a new school.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.720
It's strange for them
at first, too,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.480
but what they find out
is this school

01:49.480 --> 01:52.040
is far stranger
than they could ever imagine.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.920
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:59.920 --> 02:01.920
I call this story...

02:19.240 --> 02:20.760
[Thump]

[Dog whimpers]

02:31.080 --> 02:32.520
<i>[David]
The Blackbrook School</i>

02:32.520 --> 02:34.040
<i> was supposed to be</i>

02:34.040 --> 02:36.200
<i> one of the best
boarding schools around,</i>

02:36.200 --> 02:39.520
<i> so when Mr. and Mrs. Wilson
had to go away on business,</i>

02:39.520 --> 02:40.960
<i> they thought it would be</i>

02:40.960 --> 02:42.120
<i> the perfect place
to send their kids.</i>

02:43.360 --> 02:43.600
<i> The perfect place
to send their kids.</i>

02:47.280 --> 02:48.720
So...

02:48.720 --> 02:51.200
What do you think?

02:51.200 --> 02:55.200
Classic postindustrial,
prewar construction.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.200
I think
it's charming.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.200
I think
it's a pit.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.800
Well, I think
we should go

03:01.800 --> 03:04.760
and try and find
the Taylors. Come on.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.320
<i>[David]
Augie and Jasmine</i>

03:07.320 --> 03:09.480
<i> had never been
to a boarding school,</i>

03:09.480 --> 03:11.640
<i> and they weren't
too happy about it.</i>

03:11.640 --> 03:14.640
<i> If they had only known
what was waiting for them,</i>

03:14.640 --> 03:17.200
<i> they never would have
set foot inside.</i>

03:19.080 --> 03:21.200
Why can't we just go
with you?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.720
Honey, we've been
through this.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.720
We don't want
to disrupt school.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.720
So you ditch us
in this prison?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.240
We're not ditching you,
and it's not a prison.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.160
It's a very well-known,
highly respected--

03:31.160 --> 03:32.640
[girl screams]

03:32.640 --> 03:35.600
Oh, my god.
What was that?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.720
[Girl screams]

03:43.720 --> 03:45.240
What's the matter?

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
Calm down.
It's OK.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.080
Who are you?

03:51.080 --> 03:53.080
We're parents.
You OK?

03:53.080 --> 03:54.560
Yeah, I'm OK.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.240
It was just
a nightmare.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.720
In the day?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.200
Marie?

03:59.200 --> 04:02.120
I knew we shouldn't have
left you alone here,

04:02.120 --> 04:03.760
poor dear.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.800
Hello,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.320
She was having
a nightmare.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.120
Marie's been running
a fever.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.200
She should be
in the infirmary.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.560
[Augie] Delusionary
dreams are often caused

04:14.560 --> 04:16.000

temperatures.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
You must be Augie...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.120
And Jasmine.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.280
Welcome to Blackbrook.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.280
I'm OK, really.
It was just a dream.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.120
Well, we're not going
to take any more chances.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.120
Off to the infirmary
you go.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.960
[Buzzing]

04:31.960 --> 04:33.440
What's that?

04:33.440 --> 04:34.960
Class change.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.000
Shall we all meet
in my office?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.640
Some call us
old-fashioned...

04:56.640 --> 04:58.640
and they're right,

04:58.640 --> 05:00.640
but at Blackbrook,

05:00.640 --> 05:02.560
we believe
an orderly environment

05:02.560 --> 05:05.160
is essential
to the learning process.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.520
[Buzzing]

05:06.520 --> 05:07.840
What's with
the buzzing?

05:08.720 --> 05:10.560
Why, it's our tone system.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.080
It signifies
the end of classes,

05:13.080 --> 05:15.040
mealtimes,
wake-up calls,

05:15.040 --> 05:16.520
just about
everything.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.920
Different
frequencies

05:17.920 --> 05:19.320
for different
events?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.320
Exactly. The tones
are soothing,

05:22.320 --> 05:24.320
not like the typical
jangling bells

05:24.320 --> 05:25.800
in most schools.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.560
I'll bet
you were adopted.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.040
Now, if we can...

05:29.040 --> 05:30.240
[Watch beeping]

05:30.240 --> 05:31.920
[Screaming]

05:35.320 --> 05:36.840
[Beeping stops]

05:36.840 --> 05:39.520
Mr. Taylor,
are you all right?

05:39.520 --> 05:40.680
[Mr. taylor]
Uh...

05:40.680 --> 05:42.160
Y-yes.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.200
Thank you.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.600
Um, forgive me.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.600
I've been having
migraines.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.080
It doesn't happen
often,

05:51.080 --> 05:53.600
but when it does,
watch out.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.920
Well, is there something
we can get you?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.080
No, no, I'm--
I'm quite all right.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.080
Please...

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
Let's continue.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.040
I don't want
to stay here.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.520
I'm afraid
we don't have a choice.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.040
Oh! Yes, we do.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.040
Why do you always accept
things without a fight?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
Because things happen
for a reason,

06:15.040 --> 06:16.520
and I understand that.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.040
Yeah? What's the reason
that guy went nuts in there?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.680
Did one of his
little tones

06:20.680 --> 06:22.040
tell him
to freak out?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.480
No. He had
a headache.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.520
Headache? I thought his
brain was going to explode,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.160
and if I got to
stay here,

06:27.160 --> 06:28.600
my brain's going to
explode, too.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.040
Look, jazz,
you can get crazy

06:30.040 --> 06:32.040
and make a big stink
like you always do,

06:32.040 --> 06:33.920
but it's not going to
change things.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.160
If Mom and Dad could take
us with them, they would,

06:37.160 --> 06:38.640
but they can't,
so get over it.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.600
Augie, I've never
been away from home.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
It's only
for six months.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.120
We can handle it.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.640
We have to do it
for Mom and Dad.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.360
Yeah, well,
I'm not wearing

06:49.360 --> 06:51.280
one of those
lame uniforms.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.560
Well,
it's official.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.040
I'm a geek.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.560
I'm going to miss you
so much.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.040
Me, too, Mom.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.640
Promise to write
once a week?

07:01.640 --> 07:03.000
We promise.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.120
You guys be good, now.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.240
We will.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.600
I love you. See you
in about a month.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.800
Bye.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.480
I'm really
depressed.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.000
[Buzzing]

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I think
that means dinner.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.480
My programming tells
me you are correct.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.080
I will follow.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.520
What is this?

07:51.520 --> 07:53.000
Spunge.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.520
Sponge...

07:54.520 --> 07:56.640
Like what
you clean with?

07:56.640 --> 07:58.160
No, spunge
with a "U."

07:58.160 --> 07:59.760
It's great. Try it.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
No, thanks.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.920
It's some sort of
grain-meal, like grits.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.160
Doesn't look so hot,
but it's good.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.360
We get it for dessert
every night.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.920
I think I'll pass
as well.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.520
[Buzzing]

08:21.480 --> 08:23.760
I'll show you where
to put your plates.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.800
That buzzer is going to
make me nuts.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.960
<i>[David] All the other
kids were pretty cool,</i>

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
<i> and they seemed to
like the place,</i>

08:38.960 --> 08:41.440
<i> so Augie and Jazz figured
they might as well kick back</i>

08:41.440 --> 08:42.960
<i> and try and fit in.</i>

08:42.960 --> 08:45.960

just a little bit off</i>

<i> about the Blackbrook
School,</i>

very strange rules.</i>

08:50.800 --> 08:52.360
Willie!

08:55.040 --> 08:58.040
We've talked about
this before, young man.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.920
Now...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.920
No sad faces.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.960
We'll just remember
next time, won't we?

09:16.480 --> 09:17.920
Whoa. Are you nuts?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.400
Excuse me?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.920
Don't let anybody
see this.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.400
I'm not
bothering anybody.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.960
Doesn't matter.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.920
We're not allowed to listen
to music on school grounds.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.400
Why?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.920
Rules. The Taylors
say it gets in the way

09:30.920 --> 09:32.920
of the learning
process or something.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.400
It's bogus,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
but they're pretty
strict about it.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.240
If you're going to
listen, be cool about it.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.000
If you're going to
listen, be cool about it.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.080
<i>[David]
After a couple of weeks,</i>

10:00.080 --> 10:01.760
<i> they got used to
the rules</i>

10:01.760 --> 10:04.000
<i> and even started
to like the place.</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:06.920

10:06.920 --> 10:08.160

10:51.520 --> 10:52.800
Augie.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.200
Augie, wake up.
Aug--

10:54.200 --> 10:55.680
Shh.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.200
Don't scare me
like that.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
What is going on?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.120
You're the genius.
Tell me.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.640
This tone went off,

11:03.640 --> 11:06.640
and all the guys
got out of bed

11:06.640 --> 11:08.640
and started walking
off like zombies.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.120
Yeah. Same
with the girls.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.640
Let's alert
the Taylors.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.360
No.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.480
Let's see where
they're going. Come on.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.400
Jazz, please. I don't
want to get into trouble.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.960
Then go back.

12:20.920 --> 12:24.800
Oh, man, this is not
a normal school.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.320
Fascinating.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.080
It's some sort of
containment system for water.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.160
This is wrong.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.880
We've got to get
the authorities.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.920
Don't be
such a chicken.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.520
Kit?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.560
Kit, you OK?

13:10.360 --> 13:11.800
Amazing.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.320
What are you doing?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.400
What is this?

13:32.400 --> 13:33.840
[Gasp]

13:33.840 --> 13:37.400
I told you not to
scare me like that.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.240
This is incredible.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.320
It's like they're
all hypnotized

13:43.320 --> 13:45.840
into knowing
exactly what to do.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.400
Yeah, but what
are they doing?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.160
Don't!

14:03.840 --> 14:05.760
It's an egg.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.120
Excellent!

14:32.720 --> 14:34.320
There they are,
dear.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.440
I knew
they'd fit in.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.680
Thank goodness.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.200
I didn't think
they'd eaten their spunge.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.400
Ha ha ha!

14:43.400 --> 14:44.880
They all do.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.440
It's just too good
to resist.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.120
Come on.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.680
Let's just call
the police, OK?

15:09.680 --> 15:12.880
I want to find out
what's going on first.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.720
[Keys jingling]

15:30.360 --> 15:31.640
[Unlocking door]

15:31.640 --> 15:35.560
Our work is finally going
to pay off, my dear.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.080
The incubation
is nearly complete.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.680
We won't be alone
much longer.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.120
The master is pleased.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.920
She's been patient
these 100 years.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.120
Her Patience will
soon be rewarded.

15:52.120 --> 15:56.280
Then we can shed these
infernal trappings.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.160
A toast--

16:09.160 --> 16:11.160
to our troubled past

16:11.160 --> 16:13.640
and our glorious
future.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.360
To the master.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.080
Did you see that?

16:30.080 --> 16:31.720
Did you see that?
They're lizards.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.400
This isn't real.
It can't be.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.720
It's real,
all right.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.080
When those eggs
hatch,

16:36.080 --> 16:38.400
this place is going to
be crawling with them.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.080
I don't understand.
Are they aliens?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.080
I don't know,
and I don't care.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
All I know is we got to get
out of here and tell somebody.

16:45.080 --> 16:45.280
We can't.
They'll catch us!

16:46.240 --> 16:46.640
We can't.
They'll catch us!

16:48.160 --> 16:50.920
Look, all you ever do
is follow the rules.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.400
Well, the rules
just went

16:52.400 --> 16:53.960
out of the window,
pal.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.640
You talked me
into staying here,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.320
and now you're
going to get us out.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
I am going to
go get dressed.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.760
You get a grip!

17:22.079 --> 17:24.079
Jazz, let's go.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.040
I got a plan.
If we hook-- Aah!

17:29.040 --> 17:31.480
You children
have been naughty.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.520
You should have eaten
your spunge

17:34.520 --> 17:35.880
like all the others.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.280
You're a monster.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.800
Oh. Ha ha! Me?

17:38.800 --> 17:41.040
You haven't seen
anything yet.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.880
Aah! Ooh!

17:44.280 --> 17:45.840
[Groaning]

17:51.600 --> 17:54.040
You can't leave now.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.040
The excitement's
just begun.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.320
Ha ha ha!

18:12.120 --> 18:12.880
No!

18:13.600 --> 18:16.600
That's the way
back to the eggs.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.320
There.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.040
I don't like this.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.040
We can hide here.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.560
They'll think
we escaped

18:39.560 --> 18:41.640
and stop chasing us.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.080
[Metal rattling]

18:45.080 --> 18:47.080
What's that?

18:47.080 --> 18:49.080
The pipes.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.080
They make
funny noises.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.600
[Thump]

18:52.600 --> 18:54.160
Augie.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.560
You children should have
eaten your spunge.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.400
I'm afraid we can't let
you out to tell our secret.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.560
Ooh...

19:09.560 --> 19:11.520
What are you?

19:11.520 --> 19:15.800
The last of a race that
was doomed to extinction...

19:17.320 --> 19:18.720
Until now.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.000
[Mrs. Taylor] We've
nurtured the eggs for ages.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.040
Soon they'll hatch,

19:24.040 --> 19:27.560
and once again we can
populate the earth.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.560
And you use the kids
to take care of them.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.040
Genius,
don't you think?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.560
It's ironic.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
We're a race
of meat-eaters--

19:35.560 --> 19:37.360
all kinds of meat.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.320
Once the eggs
are hatched,

19:39.320 --> 19:42.000
the children
will serve...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.600
Another purpose.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.680
The young ones
will be very hungry.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.200
[Laughter]

19:50.200 --> 19:51.760
[Growl]

19:54.240 --> 19:55.640
We're trapped.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.160
Very few children
have caused problems

19:58.160 --> 20:00.160
the way
you two have,

20:00.160 --> 20:02.160
but when they do,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.640
they always end up
down here.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
You're very lucky.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.320
You get to meet
the mother.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.360
The mother?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.640
[Growling]

20:14.640 --> 20:16.120
Augie...

20:16.120 --> 20:17.680
What's that?

20:23.320 --> 20:27.320
You've stumbled on the
lair of our master,

20:27.320 --> 20:30.480
and she hasn't
eaten in days.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.920
Ha ha ha!

20:33.320 --> 20:34.880
Augie...

20:36.200 --> 20:37.480
<i> Bon appetit!</i>

20:37.480 --> 20:39.560
Ha ha ha!

20:43.560 --> 20:45.600
What are you doing?

20:45.600 --> 20:48.120
Getting us out
of this. Here.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.320
It's high-frequency
sound.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.720
They can't stand it.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.480
No!

20:57.280 --> 20:59.240
Don't! No!

21:00.680 --> 21:04.040
Don't!
Please! Hurry!

21:05.320 --> 21:06.040
Do it!

21:07.520 --> 21:09.400
<i> [Rock and roll blaring]</i>

21:09.400 --> 21:10.800
[Roaring]

21:10.800 --> 21:13.200
[Screaming]

21:13.200 --> 21:14.680
Louder!

21:14.680 --> 21:16.760
[Music getting louder]

21:31.480 --> 21:33.080
You did it.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.040
You did it!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.440
Oh, yuck.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.520
This better not stain.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
The Taylors.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.440
Gross.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.440
How did you know?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.960
They couldn't stand
high-frequency sound,

22:02.960 --> 22:04.960
like when
my watch went off.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.440
And no one could
play music in school.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.000
It just fit.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.440
I may be
a chicken...

22:13.440 --> 22:15.440
But I'm smart.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.000
Ha ha ha!

22:29.960 --> 22:31.400
Kit?

22:31.400 --> 22:33.400
What happened?

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
Where are we?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
Wait outside.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.440
We'll take you
upstairs.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.880
I guess when we
got the mother,

22:47.880 --> 22:49.480
we got them all.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.880
This is
like a dream.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.400
It is,

22:54.400 --> 22:57.640
and you're not going to have
nightmares anymore.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.960
The end...

23:19.160 --> 23:20.520
Or is it?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.360
I declare
this meeting

23:25.360 --> 23:27.840
of the Midnight Society
closed,

23:27.840 --> 23:31.400
and, uh, make sure
to go straight home, guys.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Why?

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
Because
tonight's...

23:39.440 --> 23:41.840
A school night.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.440
