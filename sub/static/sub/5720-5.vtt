00:10.875 --> 00:16.053

00:18.855 --> 00:21.405

00:23.023 --> 00:24.259

00:25.692 --> 00:26.396

00:30.041 --> 00:31.940

00:33.738 --> 00:34.909

00:35.341 --> 00:37.502

00:41.486 --> 00:44.076
_

00:47.858 --> 00:49.072
ELIZABETH: <i>Was that your publisher?</i>

00:49.073 --> 00:52.509
Yeah. Apparently, my
book is a best seller.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.585
Congratulations!

00:53.586 --> 00:55.821
Hey, you think they'll
make it into a movie?

00:55.822 --> 00:57.322
Okay, let me clarify
what "best seller" means

00:57.323 --> 00:58.724
in the religious nonfiction market.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.958
700 copies sold.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.193
Just over 1,000, baby.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.327
(laughs)

01:02.328 --> 01:03.562
I guess my sales shot up

01:03.563 --> 01:05.363
when my rant on C-SPAN went viral.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.832
Nothing like a well-placed tantrum

01:06.833 --> 01:07.833
to spike your popularity.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.901
I prefer trenchant social commentary.

01:09.902 --> 01:11.837
Oh, whatever, Kanye McCord.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.105
But I take him every day.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.573
I know, and I would, but
I have an early class.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.374
Can you drop Jason off this morning?

01:16.375 --> 01:18.143
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- Thanks.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.511
I have to be at school early today.

01:21.379 --> 01:22.681
I joined the school paper.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.289
- Really? That's great news.
- Oh, that's awesome.

01:24.290 --> 01:25.522
You're a reporter?
What's your beat?

01:25.523 --> 01:27.023
That's, you know, journalist talk.

01:27.024 --> 01:28.157
I'm writing a weekly column.

01:28.158 --> 01:29.792
- HENRY: About what?
- ALISON: Fashion.

01:29.793 --> 01:31.661
But your school has uniforms.

01:31.662 --> 01:33.463
All the more reason to obsess
about the weekend looks.

01:33.464 --> 01:34.897
I'll write about trends,

01:34.898 --> 01:36.232
what's in, what's out.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.934
Some of it's psychological, too.

01:37.935 --> 01:40.036
Like, why do we keep giving
block heels a chance?

01:40.037 --> 01:41.915
Right? Nobody look good in those.

01:41.916 --> 01:43.650
Hey, hey, hey.

01:43.651 --> 01:44.952
I wear block heels.

01:44.953 --> 01:47.354
You walked right into that one, Dad.

01:47.355 --> 01:49.556
I thought I might contrast

01:49.557 --> 01:51.058
expensive looks with
affordable alternatives.

01:51.059 --> 01:52.526
- (phone buzzing)
- Then I can write about makeup, too.

01:52.527 --> 01:53.541
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.076
Maybe we could go to
the mall this weekend

01:55.077 --> 01:56.511
and check out the
higher-end makeup lines.

01:56.512 --> 02:00.048
Then I can find similar shades
in the drugstore brands.

02:00.049 --> 02:02.317
Compare and contrast, you know?

02:02.318 --> 02:03.952
- Mom.
- Hang on one second.

02:03.953 --> 02:05.921
Anton Gorev wants to speak to me.

02:05.922 --> 02:08.223
- Last I heard, he was holed up in London.
- Mom.

02:08.223 --> 02:09.190
Just... baby, give me a minute.

02:09.191 --> 02:10.524
Forget it. I have to go.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.665
Is she mad?

02:16.666 --> 02:18.133
I heard mall, makeup,

02:18.134 --> 02:19.434
and then I kind of went out.

02:19.435 --> 02:20.969
She wants you to take her to the mall.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.203
Oh, I can do that.

02:22.204 --> 02:23.271
I gotta make this call, though.

02:23.272 --> 02:24.339
Okay. And, for the record,

02:24.340 --> 02:26.041
I think you look great in block heels.

02:26.042 --> 02:27.842
- Nice try.
- I...

02:27.843 --> 02:29.444
GOREV: <i>I'm sure you know</i>

02:29.445 --> 02:31.613
that Prime Minister
Rozovsky is stepping down

02:31.614 --> 02:33.281
as Acting President of Russia,

02:33.282 --> 02:35.884
and that Maria Ostrov asked
for a special election,

02:35.885 --> 02:37.919
to be held in 30 days.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.722
- A blatant power grab on her part.
- Yeah.

02:40.723 --> 02:42.223
She's asking for

02:42.224 --> 02:43.792
an open and vigorous debate,

02:43.793 --> 02:46.127
but given the amount of influence

02:46.128 --> 02:47.429
she's amassed in the last month,

02:47.430 --> 02:49.497
I doubt anyone's going to
step up to challenge her.

02:49.498 --> 02:50.999
I will challenge her.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.266
And I will win.

02:54.436 --> 02:56.338
I'm listening.

02:56.339 --> 02:58.506
Mrs. Ostrov may have the
generals in her pocket,

02:58.507 --> 03:00.875
but the tensions she is
fomenting with Ukraine

03:00.876 --> 03:03.545
are bad for business.

03:03.546 --> 03:05.213
Russia's highest-ranking officials

03:05.214 --> 03:06.581
and billionaires want peace,

03:06.582 --> 03:07.882
not war.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.584
They want me.

03:09.585 --> 03:12.087
But to mount a campaign, I need my money.

03:12.088 --> 03:13.355
When Pavel Ostrov died,

03:13.356 --> 03:15.090
you said you hoped I would succeed him.

03:15.091 --> 03:16.191
And I meant it.

03:16.192 --> 03:20.027
Well, Elizabeth, the
wheel is still turning.

03:20.695 --> 03:22.430
JAY: <i>Good morning, "A" team.</i>

03:22.431 --> 03:24.132
DAISY: Reading your memo.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.100
More like battle plan.

03:25.101 --> 03:26.568
But thanks. You up to speed?

03:26.569 --> 03:28.670
Skimmed it. So, no.

03:28.671 --> 03:30.805
Essentially, Russia is waging

03:30.806 --> 03:32.607
an "information war" in Eastern Europe.

03:32.608 --> 03:33.875
The Russian television network

03:33.876 --> 03:35.643
broadcasts these cheesy game shows

03:35.644 --> 03:37.345
that can be picked up in the
eastern part of Ukraine

03:37.346 --> 03:38.880
and the Baltic states.

03:38.881 --> 03:40.115
Where a lot of ethnic Russians live.

03:40.116 --> 03:41.116
Just read that part.

03:41.117 --> 03:42.717
Right.

03:42.718 --> 03:44.219
The shows are popular with those folks,

03:44.220 --> 03:47.589
and when they're over, the
Kremlin airs a "news hour."

03:47.590 --> 03:49.958
Otherwise known as
state-controlled propaganda.

03:49.959 --> 03:50.992
Exactly.

03:50.993 --> 03:52.193
False reports that ethnic Russians

03:52.194 --> 03:53.695
are being murdered in the west.

03:53.696 --> 03:56.064
Estonian nuclear plants are melting down.

03:56.065 --> 03:58.800
That Ukraine is secretly
planning to invade Russia.

03:58.801 --> 04:00.268
Without any truth to counter it,

04:00.269 --> 04:01.569
people believe the lies.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.271
And every day, U.S. security interests

04:03.272 --> 04:04.572
in Europe are undermined.

04:04.573 --> 04:05.640
So what's your battle plan?

04:05.641 --> 04:07.609
Public Diplomacy thinks

04:07.610 --> 04:10.745
that if we could license
a popular American program,

04:10.746 --> 04:12.702
we could air it opposite
the Russian game shows.

04:12.703 --> 04:13.740
Steal those viewers away.

04:13.741 --> 04:15.550
<i>Baywatch</i> or <i>Let's Make a Dealski?</i>

04:15.551 --> 04:17.552
I mean, it's... it's no contest.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.687
And then we follow our show
with a real news hour.

04:19.688 --> 04:21.156
I talked it over with the secretary

04:21.156 --> 04:21.935
and she feels strongly

04:21.937 --> 04:24.492
that we need to fight Russian
aggression on all fronts,

04:24.493 --> 04:27.595
and that means implementing
a long-term media strategy.

04:27.596 --> 04:29.464
Game on.

04:29.465 --> 04:30.965
What's our budget?

04:30.966 --> 04:35.737
Nothing Hollywood would be interested in.

04:35.738 --> 04:38.106
As we know, an extremely
malicious piece of malware

04:38.107 --> 04:39.507
allowed our bad actor to hack

04:39.508 --> 04:41.109
into Air Force One's computer system

04:41.110 --> 04:43.211
and shut down communication.

04:43.212 --> 04:45.346
It took 100 software engineers

04:45.347 --> 04:49.384
a month of decoding millions
of lines of encrypted code,

04:49.385 --> 04:50.652
but they were finally able

04:50.653 --> 04:53.488
to uncover this PLC
rootkit code sequence.

04:53.489 --> 04:56.624
Which is what, exactly?

04:56.625 --> 04:59.727
If hackers today think
of themselves as brands,

04:59.728 --> 05:02.030
this sequence is a digital autograph.

05:02.031 --> 05:05.166
It's unique to a legendary black hat

05:05.167 --> 05:06.501
who goes by the handle Dash.

05:06.502 --> 05:08.470
Legendary, huh?

05:08.471 --> 05:09.637
OLIVER: In the last decade,

05:09.638 --> 05:11.906
this guy has executed
offensives for China,

05:11.907 --> 05:14.309
North Korea, Russia and Iran.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.643
If you've got the cash,

05:15.644 --> 05:17.345
he's your go-to guy for cyber terror.

05:17.346 --> 05:19.214
So who hired him this time?

05:19.215 --> 05:20.415
Working on that.

05:20.416 --> 05:21.616
Do we have an ID?

05:21.617 --> 05:25.153
Allegedly, this... is Dash.

05:25.154 --> 05:27.222
I pulled the photo off the
darknet, sent it to Interpol.

05:27.223 --> 05:28.823
So far, nothing. Here's the bad news.

05:28.824 --> 05:30.859
According to the chatter
I've been listening to,

05:30.860 --> 05:32.127
he's planning another attack.

05:32.128 --> 05:33.895
How do you top hacking Air Force One?

05:33.896 --> 05:35.130
Hit the White House.

05:35.131 --> 05:36.197
ELIZABETH: Pentagon.

05:36.198 --> 05:37.999
Our missile systems.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.134
We've shored up our firewalls,

05:39.135 --> 05:41.169
but since the best defense
is a good offense,

05:41.170 --> 05:42.504
we're also setting a few honeypots.

05:42.505 --> 05:46.875
Dummy servers with false
software and decoy information

05:46.876 --> 05:48.143
to lure him in.

05:48.144 --> 05:50.078
And once he's on the hook?

05:50.079 --> 05:51.279
Then we can hack back.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.981
Maybe locate his actual server.

05:52.982 --> 05:54.916
Then, boom. He's ours.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.385
This is our top priority.

05:57.386 --> 05:58.686
Get into it with CYBERCOM.

05:58.687 --> 06:00.755
That's the next stop
on my whirlwind tour.

06:00.756 --> 06:02.522
Thank you, Mr. President.

06:03.725 --> 06:06.995
I got an interesting call from
Anton Gorev this morning,

06:06.996 --> 06:09.063
saying he wants to return home

06:09.064 --> 06:11.099
to run against Maria Ostrov next month.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.668
Is anyone else experiencing déjà vu?

06:13.669 --> 06:14.969
We went down this road, Elizabeth,

06:14.970 --> 06:16.204
and we crashed and burned.

06:16.205 --> 06:17.904
This election is another opportunity

06:17.905 --> 06:19.507
to get a moderate in the Kremlin.

06:19.508 --> 06:20.642
Election.

06:20.643 --> 06:22.977
Do we really think Maria
Ostrov has any respect

06:22.978 --> 06:24.612
for the democratic process?

06:24.613 --> 06:27.415
About as much respect as she
has for Ukraine's border.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.551
At least with our lethal aid package

06:29.552 --> 06:31.686
we can deal with that situation directly.

06:31.687 --> 06:34.956
The Ukrainian president is
at the Pentagon as we speak.

06:34.957 --> 06:36.658
But here's the thing.

06:36.659 --> 06:39.260
If Gorev was in power,

06:39.261 --> 06:40.795
Ukraine wouldn't need aid.

06:40.796 --> 06:43.565
That whole situation
could be dialed back.

06:43.566 --> 06:45.767
Maybe. But has he got a shot?

06:45.768 --> 06:47.902
Gorev's numbers have
been steadily rising,

06:47.903 --> 06:50.338
particularly with
disaffected young Russians.

06:50.339 --> 06:52.106
He still has influential friends,

06:52.107 --> 06:55.276
and if he can lure one or two generals

06:55.277 --> 06:57.845
over to his side, that moves the needle.

06:57.846 --> 06:59.214
So what does he want from us?

06:59.215 --> 07:00.882
He needs cash.

07:00.883 --> 07:03.651
The sanctions in the UK
have frozen his accounts.

07:03.652 --> 07:05.787
They want our okay to lift them.

07:05.788 --> 07:08.389
I can reach out to the
British ambassador,

07:08.390 --> 07:10.991
see if there's a deal to be made.

07:11.726 --> 07:12.660
All right.

07:12.661 --> 07:14.661
- Keep me informed.
- Okay.

07:15.797 --> 07:18.299
HENRY: <i>I understand your
commander's in town.</i>

07:18.300 --> 07:19.634
General Doroshevich.

07:19.635 --> 07:22.470
DMITRI: I've been invited to
a luncheon for the general

07:22.471 --> 07:24.038
at the embassy this afternoon.

07:24.039 --> 07:24.973
You have instructions?

07:24.974 --> 07:26.241
Just keep an ear out.

07:26.242 --> 07:28.576
Especially if there's
any talk of Ukraine.

07:28.577 --> 07:29.744
You okay with that?

07:29.745 --> 07:32.447
If I say "No, I won't spy on my country,"

07:32.448 --> 07:34.482
your people will refuse
care to my sister.

07:34.483 --> 07:35.984
Maybe beat me with a phone book again.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.085
So, yes, I'm okay with that.

07:37.086 --> 07:38.286
- Is that all?
- Okay, listen to me, Dmitri.

07:38.287 --> 07:39.821
I know that you don't like this.

07:39.822 --> 07:41.789
I don't much like it, either.

07:41.790 --> 07:44.292
But I'm here, doing the
work, because Russia

07:44.293 --> 07:46.160
is heading down a path
that could be disastrous...

07:46.161 --> 07:47.395
I don't need to hear about Russia.

07:47.396 --> 07:48.863
- I know...
- Then stop behaving like a child

07:48.864 --> 07:51.231
and help me.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.774
Have you ever heard of

07:59.775 --> 08:02.176
Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov?

08:02.177 --> 08:03.478
I'm assuming he's not a relative.

08:03.479 --> 08:05.113
Petrov is a common name.

08:05.114 --> 08:06.481
No, I've never heard of him.

08:06.482 --> 08:08.182
He's a Russian hero,

08:08.183 --> 08:09.550
although your government

08:09.551 --> 08:11.286
doesn't like to acknowledge that.

08:11.287 --> 08:12.887
I don't understand.

08:12.888 --> 08:16.357
One night in 1983, Petrov was at his post

08:16.358 --> 08:18.026
at the missile attack
early warning system

08:18.027 --> 08:20.328
when suddenly, all the alarms went off.

08:20.329 --> 08:22.330
There was a "high reliability"

08:22.331 --> 08:24.399
that the United States had launched ICBMs

08:24.400 --> 08:25.533
into the Soviet Union.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.335
Petrov's training dictated

08:27.336 --> 08:29.570
that he launch Russian missiles

08:29.571 --> 08:32.206
as a retaliatory strike
against the United States.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.342
But his gut...

08:34.342 --> 08:36.678
told him that it had
to be a false alarm.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.313
So he called his superiors

08:39.315 --> 08:41.015
and he told them not to launch.

08:41.015 --> 08:44.284
And then he waited for 23 long minutes,

08:44.285 --> 08:47.255
and when no missiles fell,
he knew he was right.

08:47.256 --> 08:51.326
Stanislav Petrov saved the world,

08:51.327 --> 08:54.228
because he trusted his instincts.

08:54.229 --> 08:58.833
I think your instincts are
telling you to work with me,

08:58.834 --> 09:00.435
because you know it's best for Russia

09:00.436 --> 09:02.769
and for the rest of the world.

09:07.108 --> 09:08.676
BLAKE: <i>I will talk to the secretary.</i>

09:08.677 --> 09:11.077
Well... stall him.

09:11.946 --> 09:14.515
The British ambassador's already here?

09:14.516 --> 09:15.683
No, ma'am.

09:15.684 --> 09:17.585
It's Ukrainian President Mikhail Bozek.

09:17.586 --> 09:19.387
His motorcade just drove up.

09:19.388 --> 09:20.388
What?

09:20.389 --> 09:21.989
He's requesting a meeting with you.

09:21.990 --> 09:25.360
So he's done picking up
weapons at the Pentagon

09:25.361 --> 09:27.829
and he doesn't have any lunch plans?

09:27.830 --> 09:29.664
It's highly unusual, ma'am.

09:29.665 --> 09:31.065
What would you like to do?

09:31.066 --> 09:33.968
Mikhail, what a surprise.

09:33.969 --> 09:35.636
Thank you for seeing me.

09:35.637 --> 09:36.838
Of course.

09:36.839 --> 09:39.774
Uh, this is Nadine Tolliver,
my chief of staff,

09:39.775 --> 09:41.776
and Jay Whitman, my chief policy advisor.

09:41.777 --> 09:42.944
Pleasure to meet you both.

09:42.945 --> 09:44.612
I hope everything was satisfactory

09:44.613 --> 09:45.813
with our aid package.

09:45.814 --> 09:47.849
It is all very much appreciated.

09:47.850 --> 09:50.318
I want to assure you that
our support of Ukraine

09:50.319 --> 09:52.286
extends beyond military aid.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.554
Um, Jay... I...

09:53.555 --> 09:54.956
Sit, please.

09:54.957 --> 09:57.258
Jay is working to
counteract the propaganda

09:57.259 --> 09:59.560
that's been coming out of Russia lately.

09:59.561 --> 10:02.630
Russian news anchors say
my government is illegal.

10:02.631 --> 10:04.165
That I'm a usurper.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.666
We're doing everything we can

10:05.667 --> 10:07.702
to fight that message.

10:07.703 --> 10:10.271
Unfortunately, the situation
is approaching a crisis point,

10:10.272 --> 10:12.140
which is why I am here.

10:12.141 --> 10:16.544
Ukraine must become a full
NATO member, immediately.

10:16.545 --> 10:20.882
Well, applying for NATO membership

10:20.883 --> 10:23.184
is a years-long process.

10:23.185 --> 10:25.920
Yes, but the situation
has drastically changed.

10:25.921 --> 10:28.256
You have influence with President Dalton.

10:28.257 --> 10:29.757
You can convince him

10:29.758 --> 10:32.160
that Ukraine requires this protection.

10:32.161 --> 10:34.195
But it's more than protection.

10:34.196 --> 10:36.597
If Russia invaded Ukraine,

10:36.598 --> 10:38.800
the NATO response force would be required

10:38.801 --> 10:39.934
to challenge Russia militarily.

10:39.935 --> 10:41.769
We're talking about a global conflict.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.372
Even if the president was willing

10:44.373 --> 10:46.107
to fast track your admission,

10:46.108 --> 10:49.510
the NATO members will never
agree to admit your country

10:49.511 --> 10:50.878
while there are tensions with Russia.

10:50.879 --> 10:52.280
Tensions?

10:52.281 --> 10:54.916
The moment Maria Ostrov is elected,

10:54.917 --> 10:58.653
she will launch an invasion
into Western Ukraine.

10:58.654 --> 11:01.121
Will you just sit by and watch?

11:03.090 --> 11:07.327
I'll let the president
know that we spoke.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.669
Please.

11:14.670 --> 11:17.538
Also let him know that Ukraine's fate

11:17.539 --> 11:19.140
is in your hands.

11:19.141 --> 11:21.375
The next time you see me,

11:21.376 --> 11:24.678
I may be strung up in
Mykhailivska Square.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.349
Thank you for your time, Elizabeth.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.418
Of course.

11:30.419 --> 11:32.420
I'll see you out,

11:32.421 --> 11:34.721
Mr. President.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.991
(indistinct chatter)

11:45.099 --> 11:47.201
See, the truth is

11:47.202 --> 11:49.237
whether or not

11:49.238 --> 11:51.539
Ukraine is a member of NATO,

11:51.540 --> 11:54.041
I don't believe that we'll
let Russia attack the west

11:54.042 --> 11:57.812
without launching a military
strike back of our own.

11:57.813 --> 12:00.014
BLAKE: Ma'am?

12:00.015 --> 12:01.849
Uh, British Ambassador Graham Shenton

12:01.850 --> 12:03.217
- is on his way up.
- Right.

12:03.218 --> 12:06.721
I hope Shenton is in
an accommodating mood.

12:06.722 --> 12:07.855
(chuckles)

12:07.856 --> 12:09.924
We really need the U.K.
to lift those sanctions

12:09.925 --> 12:11.192
on Gorev's cash.

12:11.193 --> 12:13.394
You...

12:13.395 --> 12:15.696
you think he can beat Maria Ostrov?

12:15.697 --> 12:18.799
I hope so.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.435
Anton Gorev becoming president of Russia

12:21.436 --> 12:25.172
might mean the difference between peace

12:25.173 --> 12:27.974
and World War III.

ELIZABETH: <i>Mr. Ambassador, Anton
Gorev is under the impression</i>

12:53.614 --> 12:55.881
that the U.K. is willing
to lift the sanctions

12:55.882 --> 12:57.583
on his accounts.

12:57.584 --> 12:58.918
Uh, given U.S. approval.

12:58.919 --> 13:00.653
Well, that's what we told him.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.087
But we assumed it be a non-issue,

13:02.088 --> 13:03.289
because you would refuse.

13:03.290 --> 13:06.825
Well, the president is
considering his request.

13:06.826 --> 13:08.727
So, what's the real problem?

13:08.728 --> 13:11.764
The 138 oligarchs whose sanctions

13:11.765 --> 13:13.165
won't be lifted.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.435
Ah, so if you release
the sanctions on Gorev,

13:16.436 --> 13:19.138
the rest will beat a path to your door.

13:19.139 --> 13:21.806
There should be some way to get
the man back his own money.

13:24.376 --> 13:25.411
ELIZABETH: Wait a minute.

13:25.412 --> 13:29.148
Didn't I read an op-ed...?

13:29.149 --> 13:31.850
By, um, Sir Richard Edgemont

13:31.851 --> 13:33.686
in, it was in <i>The Sunday Times.</i>

13:33.687 --> 13:36.221
He was... he was complaining

13:36.222 --> 13:38.223
that-that the Londoners had sold

13:38.224 --> 13:40.859
too much of their
property to the Russians?

13:40.860 --> 13:42.728
He said his hometown

13:42.729 --> 13:44.930
was beginning to look like "Londongrad."

13:44.931 --> 13:48.434
Uh, yes, the gentry made
millions off the oligarchs.

13:48.435 --> 13:50.102
Now they're complaining
there's too much coffee

13:50.103 --> 13:51.837
and vatrushka on the corner shops.

13:51.838 --> 13:53.272
Not enough tea and scones.

13:53.273 --> 13:55.474
Anton Gorev owns at least
three properties in England.

13:55.475 --> 13:57.576
They've got to be worth close
to a 100 million total.

13:57.577 --> 13:59.878
What if we could convince

13:59.879 --> 14:02.247
Sir Richard to buy them from him

14:02.248 --> 14:03.582
for cash?

14:03.583 --> 14:06.218
Well, that would certainly
fill Gorev's coffers.

14:06.219 --> 14:08.554
Uh, but would it trigger the sanctions?

14:08.555 --> 14:11.290
It shouldn't, if he used
an offshore bank.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.558
And I could

14:12.559 --> 14:14.259
make sure the Finance Ministry

14:14.260 --> 14:16.829
doesn't throw up any red flags.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.798
Mr. Ambassador, thank you
so much for coming in.

14:19.799 --> 14:21.233
I really appreciate it.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.534
- Madam Secretary.
- Great.

14:26.071 --> 14:27.072
(short laugh)

14:27.073 --> 14:28.040
(door closes)

14:28.041 --> 14:30.042
Oliver Shaw sent over a hardcopy

14:30.043 --> 14:31.810
of his report

14:31.811 --> 14:33.245
on the Air Force One cyber-attack.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.447
Any news on his hacker trap?

14:35.448 --> 14:36.389
No, not yet. Oh, uh,

14:36.390 --> 14:38.584
your studio executives
are on their way up.

14:38.585 --> 14:39.618
Show time.

14:39.619 --> 14:41.820
Think I'm ready for my close-up.

14:41.821 --> 14:43.756
DAISY: <i>And this is the conference room.</i>

14:43.757 --> 14:46.191
Where many important
deals have been struck.

14:46.192 --> 14:47.259
Well, thanks for the tour.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.861
There is so much history here.

14:48.862 --> 14:50.195
I've always wanted to develop some kind

14:50.196 --> 14:51.530
of historical political drama.

14:51.531 --> 14:53.365
Like <i>John Adams,</i> but as a series.

14:53.366 --> 14:54.733
Well, I've tried it.

14:54.734 --> 14:57.236
And, uh, it's cost prohibitive.

14:57.237 --> 14:58.303
MAN: And boring.

14:58.304 --> 15:00.039
Unless they're all sleeping together.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.207
That's very Washington.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.476
Not in this office.

15:04.477 --> 15:06.879
So I gave you a rough outline of what

15:06.880 --> 15:08.480
we're hoping to achieve
in the e-mail I sent.

15:08.481 --> 15:11.350
Right, so you want to air our
shows in Eastern Europe,

15:11.351 --> 15:13.152
and then follow them
with pro-western news.

15:13.153 --> 15:16.388
I'm sure you've heard about
Russia's recent aggression.

15:16.389 --> 15:18.571
I can't get into the classified details,

15:18.572 --> 15:20.272
but in the next few months,

15:20.273 --> 15:22.274
we could be on the brink
of war in Europe.

15:22.275 --> 15:24.744
DAISY: Altering the negative
perceptions of the U.S.

15:24.745 --> 15:26.379
in the minds of ethnic Russians

15:26.380 --> 15:28.647
could literally change
the course of our future.

15:28.648 --> 15:30.816
Well, I-I just want to say

15:30.817 --> 15:32.852
that, uh, it-it's an honor

15:32.853 --> 15:35.087
to be asked to contribute to the cause.

15:35.088 --> 15:38.090
"Contribute." Now, that's
an excellent word.

15:38.091 --> 15:41.027
We're asking you to make a
contribution to your country,

15:41.028 --> 15:44.129
in the name of patriotism.

15:45.197 --> 15:47.199
Okay.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.169
So, our studio produces television shows

15:50.170 --> 15:51.670
at a deficit.

15:51.671 --> 15:55.007
And we make our money back over
time through license fees.

15:55.008 --> 15:57.743
So, um, what were you thinking

15:57.744 --> 15:59.211
in terms of a fee?

15:59.212 --> 16:03.249
Actually, I was using
the word "contribute"

16:03.250 --> 16:06.084
literally.

16:07.420 --> 16:10.088
Mm.

16:16.729 --> 16:18.196
(imitates explosion)

16:22.368 --> 16:24.336
You should not be on your own.

16:24.337 --> 16:27.506
People will say you keep secrets.

16:27.507 --> 16:31.010
They can say what they like.

16:31.011 --> 16:33.712
I will stand with you.

16:33.713 --> 16:36.781
We'll look like we are
being social together.

16:38.784 --> 16:40.920
You're a good friend, Ivan.

16:40.921 --> 16:43.221
And a good Russian.

16:44.056 --> 16:47.725
Sometimes I find it is
not so easy to be both.

It's Dmitri.

18:08.808 --> 18:10.242
Yeah, what's up?

18:10.243 --> 18:12.511
Sir, I can't do this.

18:12.512 --> 18:13.646
Where are you?

18:13.647 --> 18:15.548
I'm-I'm, uh, I'm in the embassy.

18:15.549 --> 18:16.838
I drank too much.

18:16.839 --> 18:17.966
Okay, listen to me.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.816
You got to get yourself
together and get out of there.

18:19.817 --> 18:20.669
Do you understand?

18:20.670 --> 18:22.004
No, you don't understand.

18:22.005 --> 18:23.505
Now, Dmitri.

18:23.506 --> 18:25.273

DALTON: <i>Did Bozek really
ask to join NATO?</i>

18:53.102 --> 18:54.703
That lethal aid package he got from us

18:54.704 --> 18:56.538
must've included a pair of brass ones.

18:56.539 --> 18:57.973
Okay, he's right to be concerned.

18:57.974 --> 19:01.043
The situation is growing
worse by the day.

19:01.044 --> 19:03.345
We need somebody who can deescalate it.

19:03.346 --> 19:05.948
I know you think that
someone is Anton Gorev.

19:05.949 --> 19:08.016
But he doesn't have the money to run.

19:08.017 --> 19:11.320
It's true that the British
refuse to lift the sanctions,

19:11.321 --> 19:13.422
- But...
- But you have a backup plan.

19:13.423 --> 19:15.891
I just spoke to Sir Richard Edgemont.

19:15.892 --> 19:17.693
And he is willing to purchase

19:17.694 --> 19:19.127
Gorev's two London townhouses

19:19.128 --> 19:21.597
and his country home in Wiltshire

19:21.598 --> 19:24.066
for 80 million cash.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.101
It's a great deal for everyone.

19:26.102 --> 19:27.502
CRAIG: Except us.

19:27.503 --> 19:29.738
With all the hoops we're
jumping through on his behalf,

19:29.739 --> 19:31.173
Anton Gorev should be required

19:31.174 --> 19:33.108
to work with our intelligence people.

19:33.109 --> 19:34.522
When Pavel Ostrov was president,

19:34.523 --> 19:37.144
Gorev was his right-hand
man for God's sake.

19:37.145 --> 19:38.380
He has information we could use.

19:38.381 --> 19:40.749
He will never go for it.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.818
He's not gonna betray
his country for money.

19:42.819 --> 19:45.053
Even if that money was
the difference between

19:45.054 --> 19:47.222
a return to power and
a lifetime in exile?

19:47.223 --> 19:49.358
For one minute,

19:49.359 --> 19:51.360
let's think of Gorev as an asset.

19:51.361 --> 19:53.228
Not just the answer to
our Russian problem.

19:53.229 --> 19:54.296
And I'm afraid

19:54.297 --> 19:55.864
that if we push him too hard

19:55.865 --> 19:57.299
and he walks away,

19:57.300 --> 19:58.767
we'll be handing Maria Ostrov

19:58.768 --> 19:59.968
the presidency.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.637
I'm not convinced he will walk away.

20:01.638 --> 20:02.571
He's a loyalist.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.072
He's a desperate man...

20:04.073 --> 20:05.407
in need of money.

20:05.408 --> 20:07.209
(sighs)

20:07.210 --> 20:09.077
Hold the cash.

20:09.078 --> 20:12.179
Let's turn the screws.

20:35.704 --> 20:38.005
(car engine starts up)

20:39.545 --> 20:42.210
I can make parts of the State
Department and White House

20:42.211 --> 20:43.478
available for film shoots.

20:43.479 --> 20:44.780
Oh, that's a nice offer, Jay.

20:44.781 --> 20:46.515
But it's pretty easy to
shoot in L.A. or New York

20:46.516 --> 20:48.750
and make it look like D.C.

20:48.751 --> 20:50.786
And even if we did agree
to forgo our profits,

20:50.787 --> 20:52.287
someone still has to pay residuals

20:52.288 --> 20:54.589
to the actors in the show,
the writers and directors.

20:54.590 --> 20:56.124
We can negotiate waivers.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.259
With the talent unions?

20:57.260 --> 20:59.161
I mean, maybe you should
try something easier,

20:59.162 --> 21:01.363
like a, uh, Middle East peace accord.

21:01.364 --> 21:04.066
Now, Jay, you want an expensive product

21:04.067 --> 21:05.600
for virtually nothing.

21:05.601 --> 21:07.402
Just because you have
a special interest,

21:07.403 --> 21:08.537
it doesn't meant that...

21:08.538 --> 21:09.871
I-I'm sorry.

21:09.872 --> 21:12.908
Helping to prevent World War
III is a "special interest"?

21:12.909 --> 21:17.011
'Cause... that's what's at stake here.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.051
What the hell are you doing?

21:23.052 --> 21:24.920
What? I'm walking down the street.

21:24.921 --> 21:26.888
- This is a free country, right?
- Not for you.

21:26.889 --> 21:27.923
Not right now.

21:27.924 --> 21:29.825
You have got to stay sharp, Dmitri!

21:29.826 --> 21:32.227
You make one stupid mistake, and
you can get yourself killed.

21:32.228 --> 21:34.596
Yeah, what doesn't matter
as long as I do my job?

21:34.597 --> 21:35.797
It matters to me.

21:35.798 --> 21:38.433
It matters to your sister.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.435
Go get sober, then call me.

21:40.436 --> 21:42.337
Wait.

21:42.338 --> 21:45.340
Is Anton Gorev gonna run
against Maria Ostrov

21:45.341 --> 21:46.842
for the presidency?

21:46.843 --> 21:48.643
Why do you ask?

21:48.644 --> 21:51.813
Well, I overheard some
intelligence officers

21:51.814 --> 21:54.101
say that they were bringing
Gorev's daughter to the embassy.

21:54.102 --> 21:54.816
- Olga?
- Yeah.

21:54.817 --> 21:56.752
They said she would stay for a month.

21:56.753 --> 22:00.522
Then I thought maybe she's
some kind of leverage.

22:00.523 --> 22:02.923
But maybe this is at her request.

22:03.859 --> 22:06.160
Go back to your dorm.

22:09.430 --> 22:10.932
LEHANE: <i>I know this is disappointing,</i>

22:10.933 --> 22:13.935
but in many ways, the
entertainment industry

22:13.936 --> 22:15.270
is like the federal government, right?

22:15.271 --> 22:16.938
It's large, somewhat inefficient,

22:16.939 --> 22:18.874
and it's very resistant to change.

22:18.875 --> 22:21.676
If you would just agree to
keep working with me, I...

22:21.677 --> 22:23.678
Much as I hate to do it, I can't.

22:23.679 --> 22:24.813
It's-it's just not feasible.

22:24.814 --> 22:26.413
I have to pass.

22:27.749 --> 22:30.152
I can get you ten minutes
with the president.

22:30.153 --> 22:33.121
I already met him... fundraiser
at Gwen Stefani's house.

22:33.122 --> 22:35.123
MATT: It's nice to meet you.

22:35.124 --> 22:36.458
DAISY: Great meeting
you, thank you so much.

22:36.459 --> 22:38.160
- It was so nice to meet you.
- (elevator dings)

22:38.161 --> 22:40.162
- Thank you.
- Okay, appreciate it.

22:40.163 --> 22:42.197
- Okay, nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

22:42.198 --> 22:43.498
Okay, let's go.

22:43.499 --> 22:45.667
Listen, you're right, okay?

22:45.668 --> 22:48.036
I don't... I don't have
anything to trade with you.

22:48.037 --> 22:49.337
Come on.

22:49.338 --> 22:51.006
Ten years ago, I was
stationed at a consulate

22:51.007 --> 22:52.174
in Herat, Afghanistan.

22:52.175 --> 22:53.809
It was dangerous,

22:53.810 --> 22:57.512
but we'd been there for
months, no problems.

22:57.513 --> 22:59.481
We let our guard down.

22:59.482 --> 23:01.483
One of our SUVs hit a roadside bomb,

23:01.484 --> 23:04.186
and three foreign service
officers were killed.

23:04.187 --> 23:05.420
Friends of mine.

23:05.421 --> 23:06.455
I'm so sorry.

23:06.456 --> 23:07.855
I'm-I'm not done.

23:09.891 --> 23:11.226
We were evacuated the next day.

23:11.227 --> 23:12.527
I was getting on a h...

23:12.528 --> 23:15.497
I was literally getting on a helicopter.

23:15.498 --> 23:18.500
When the consul came up, he
wanted me to stay with him

23:18.501 --> 23:21.002
and-and handle the
arrangements for the bodies.

23:21.003 --> 23:24.005
We needed to get them back to
the States, to their families.

23:24.006 --> 23:26.942
I said, "No.

23:26.943 --> 23:28.610
Let someone else do it."

23:28.611 --> 23:30.612
I was young and scared,

23:30.613 --> 23:33.147
and I WA... I wanted to go home.

23:34.850 --> 23:36.485
But the next morning, I regretted it,

23:36.486 --> 23:38.854
and every day since, I regret it,

23:38.855 --> 23:43.558
because when it was my turn
to help, I... I said no.

23:43.559 --> 23:45.527
This is your turn.

23:45.528 --> 23:48.597
And if you say no, if you say,
"Let someone else do it,"

23:48.598 --> 23:51.799
I promise you, you'll wake
up tomorrow morning...

23:52.767 --> 23:55.737
...and you'll...

23:55.738 --> 23:58.038
you'll regret it.

24:00.809 --> 24:03.111
(elevator dings)

24:03.112 --> 24:05.080
I'm sorry, Jay.

24:05.081 --> 24:07.881
I, uh, I really am.

24:19.194 --> 24:22.230
<i>(buzzing)</i>

24:22.231 --> 24:24.599
Professor McCord.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.934
Is everything all right?

24:25.935 --> 24:27.569
Olga, I think it would be a good idea

24:27.570 --> 24:29.304
if you came to stay
with Elizabeth and me

24:29.305 --> 24:30.739
for a couple of days.

24:30.740 --> 24:33.440
Do I have time to pack a bag?

24:34.509 --> 24:36.143
I'm gonna say no.

24:40.749 --> 24:42.083
Olga Gorev, come with us.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.785
Hey, guys, what can I do for you?

24:43.786 --> 24:45.353
This is not your business, mister.

24:45.354 --> 24:46.655
Her father send us.

24:46.656 --> 24:47.956
Oh, it must be some kind of mistake,

24:47.957 --> 24:49.991
'cause just got off the
phone with her father.

24:49.992 --> 24:51.793
Anton and I are old friends.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.762
I'll have him give you a call,

24:53.763 --> 24:56.597
let you know that everything's okay.

25:06.162 --> 25:08.569
Elizabeth, I will not
trade government secrets

25:08.570 --> 25:09.509
to the Americans.

25:09.510 --> 25:10.844
The price you're asking is too high.

25:10.845 --> 25:12.779
The president was very insistent.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.448
(phone rings)

25:14.449 --> 25:16.116
This is my daughter calling.

25:16.117 --> 25:17.718
But my answer to the president

25:17.719 --> 25:19.620
is that he should find another chump.

25:19.621 --> 25:21.221
- (beeps)
- BLAKE: Ma'am.

25:21.222 --> 25:24.508
Henry's on the phone,
he says it's urgent.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.848
HENRY: Hey, girls, don't
fill up on popcorn.

25:29.849 --> 25:30.848
I got dinner.

25:30.849 --> 25:31.849
Mom will be here soon.

25:31.850 --> 25:32.818
No worries, Dad.

25:32.819 --> 25:34.119
Olga, you settling in okay?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.421
Yes, thanks.

25:35.422 --> 25:37.184
Alison is taking excellent care of me.

25:37.185 --> 25:38.360
Good.

25:38.674 --> 25:39.542
JASON: <i>I don't get it.</i>

25:39.543 --> 25:41.912
She's here for a long visit,
and she doesn't pack a suitcase?

25:41.913 --> 25:42.861
Yes.

25:42.862 --> 25:45.219
- But everything's fine.
- Yeah.

25:45.220 --> 25:47.232
Oh, yeah, she's just visiting
like any other normal person.

25:47.233 --> 25:49.267
You know, without extra clothes.

25:49.268 --> 25:50.569
Yes.

25:50.570 --> 25:53.075
- You probably want me to stop
asking questions, huh? - Yes.

25:53.192 --> 25:54.492
ELIZABETH: I'm home.

25:54.493 --> 25:55.633
Run upstairs and tell the girls

25:55.634 --> 25:57.335
dinner's in about ten minutes, would you?

25:57.336 --> 25:59.002
- All right.
- Thank you.

26:04.108 --> 26:07.111
Okay, so I've had about
20 minutes in the car

26:07.112 --> 26:10.480
to process this news, and I
think I know what's going on.

26:11.349 --> 26:12.949
No. No, I don't.

26:14.018 --> 26:16.354
What's the official story again?

26:16.355 --> 26:20.324
Olga Gorev spontaneously
decided to come for a visit.

26:20.325 --> 26:23.928
Okay, so is there an unofficial story?

26:23.929 --> 26:25.329
Yes, but I can't discuss it with you.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.498
I have a very high security clearance.

26:27.499 --> 26:28.900
HENRY: (chuckles) I'm aware.

26:28.901 --> 26:30.200
Even so.

26:32.436 --> 26:33.771
So how long is she staying?

26:33.772 --> 26:35.740
A while.

26:35.741 --> 26:37.441
- Days or weeks?
- Weeks.

26:37.442 --> 26:39.243
About three to four weeks?

26:39.244 --> 26:40.945
Elizabeth, don't interrogate me.

26:40.946 --> 26:42.914
This is about the Russian
elections, isn't it?

26:42.915 --> 26:44.916
Does Maria Ostrov think
that Gorev is running,

26:44.917 --> 26:47.018
- that he's a threat?
- Can't say. Is Gorev gonna run?

26:47.019 --> 26:48.319
Is that why he called this morning?

26:48.320 --> 26:49.887
Was Olga gonna be used as leverage

26:49.888 --> 26:51.921
- to keep him out of the race?
- I don't know.

26:52.657 --> 26:54.458
That's the truth.

26:54.459 --> 26:56.460
Babe, wait a minute.

26:56.461 --> 26:57.795
Things are in play.

26:57.796 --> 26:59.730
Delicate moves are being made.

26:59.731 --> 27:01.332
If any of it has been compromised

27:01.333 --> 27:04.969
- by something that you've done...
- It was a judgment call.

27:04.970 --> 27:07.138
You and I made a promise to Anton Gorev.

27:07.139 --> 27:09.639
(sighs) That we would look after Olga.

27:13.344 --> 27:14.979
I'm gonna go get changed.

27:14.980 --> 27:16.614
And then I'm gonna call the president

27:16.615 --> 27:19.449
and tell him that we have a house guest.

27:22.987 --> 27:24.655
Hey. (knocks on door)

27:24.656 --> 27:27.058
I'm sorry that didn't work out today.

27:27.059 --> 27:28.225
Thanks.

27:28.226 --> 27:31.162
And I appreciate the
support, you and Daisy.

27:31.163 --> 27:33.063
Any time.

27:35.132 --> 27:37.801
Hey, you know what they call
you in the office pool?

27:39.904 --> 27:43.574
Saint Jay, patron of the long shot.

27:43.575 --> 27:46.276
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

27:47.378 --> 27:49.312
Well, it is.

27:58.522 --> 28:01.191
I didn't know that you
lost friends over there.

28:02.893 --> 28:05.229
I'm sorry.

28:05.230 --> 28:07.864
I-I don't talk about it much.

28:10.301 --> 28:13.603
For a long time, you
know, I felt... guilty.

28:14.805 --> 28:18.776
Not just for... leaving when I did,

28:18.777 --> 28:22.813
but... for not being
in the car with them.

28:22.814 --> 28:26.150
Yeah, but if you were in
the car, you'd be dead too.

28:26.151 --> 28:29.352
And that's why they call
it survivor's guilt.

28:32.356 --> 28:35.725
Look, I don't pretend to
know what you went through.

28:37.428 --> 28:40.398
All I know is what I see.

28:40.399 --> 28:44.869
And every day, I see you here,
fighting the good fight.

28:44.870 --> 28:47.872
You may not always win,

28:47.873 --> 28:50.908
but you never stop fighting.

28:50.909 --> 28:53.911
And it counts, man.

28:53.912 --> 28:56.312
It counts for a lot.

29:04.015 --> 29:04.722
ALISON: <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

29:04.723 --> 29:06.390
ELIZABETH: Hey, sweetheart.

29:06.391 --> 29:07.758
Can we talk about my column?

29:07.759 --> 29:09.126
It's due tomorrow.

29:09.127 --> 29:10.461
Yeah, I read it at work.

29:10.462 --> 29:11.729
I e-mailed you.

29:11.730 --> 29:12.730
I really liked it.

29:12.731 --> 29:15.099
I was kind of hoping for more.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.100
Well, um...

29:16.101 --> 29:17.735
there were...

29:17.736 --> 29:19.770
there were things in it
that really surprised me.

29:19.771 --> 29:22.807
Like, uh... like...

29:22.808 --> 29:24.208
adding different layers

29:24.209 --> 29:26.610
and wearing pointed shoes
makes you look taller.

29:26.611 --> 29:28.946
I mean, I've done that...
I can't remember since how long,

29:28.947 --> 29:31.215
and I never knew why.

29:31.216 --> 29:33.884
And what about my idea
for the second column?

29:33.885 --> 29:36.487
Um, was that in the e-mail?

29:36.488 --> 29:38.154
We talked about it this morning.

29:40.024 --> 29:41.659
You-you were going to go to the mall,

29:41.660 --> 29:43.994
and it was to shop...

29:43.995 --> 29:45.763
If you don't remember, just say so.

29:45.764 --> 29:48.165
I-I do, I remember the mall.

29:48.166 --> 29:52.169
And then... then I got that text.

29:52.170 --> 29:53.471
Oh, Alison, I'm sorry.

29:53.472 --> 29:56.140
It has been such a... long day.

29:56.141 --> 29:58.476
I... I'm sorry, I don't remember

29:58.477 --> 30:00.971
what your second article
was, uh, gonna be about.

30:00.972 --> 30:02.297
But why don't you tell me about it now?

30:02.298 --> 30:04.398
Why bother?

30:04.399 --> 30:06.875
Nothing I do makes any
kind of impression on you.

30:06.876 --> 30:09.411
It's like you couldn't
care less what I do.

30:09.412 --> 30:11.113
- I'm invisible.
- Hang on a second.

30:11.114 --> 30:13.448
I'm gonna go downstairs and talk to Olga,

30:13.449 --> 30:17.118
the stranger who finds me more
interesting than my own mother.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.819
Ali, that... I...

30:18.820 --> 30:20.754
(scoffs)

30:24.292 --> 30:27.293
Since when did you become
the easy daughter?

30:29.030 --> 30:32.033
I'm actually learning all about
that in my child psych class.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.035
It's, like, classic middle kid stuff.

30:34.036 --> 30:35.236
Okay.

30:35.237 --> 30:39.907
But... is she right?

30:39.908 --> 30:41.809
The truth?

30:41.810 --> 30:44.412
Alison gets the short end of
the attention stick around here.

30:44.413 --> 30:46.380
In what way?

30:46.381 --> 30:50.384
Well, this fashion thing, it's
been going on for a long time.

30:50.385 --> 30:51.619
Really?

30:51.620 --> 30:52.620
Years, Mom.

30:52.621 --> 30:53.621
(groans)

30:53.622 --> 30:55.189
I mean, she reads magazines and blogs.

30:55.190 --> 30:58.125
She follows trends.

30:58.126 --> 31:00.861
She even sketches designs sometimes.

31:00.862 --> 31:02.697
She does? Sketches?

31:02.698 --> 31:03.997
Mm-hmm.

31:06.033 --> 31:10.004
The president agrees Olga should
stay as long as she likes.

31:10.005 --> 31:13.107
Obviously, we'd like to keep this quiet.

31:13.108 --> 31:15.576
People could make political hay

31:15.577 --> 31:17.545
both here and in Russia if word got out.

31:17.546 --> 31:21.248
I know this puts the president
in an awkward position.

31:21.249 --> 31:22.717
He's a father too.

31:22.718 --> 31:25.553
Now I guess I'm waiting, as they say,

31:25.554 --> 31:27.420
for the other shoe to drop.

31:28.489 --> 31:30.424
My daughter is in your house.

31:30.425 --> 31:33.027
This puts you in a unique position

31:33.028 --> 31:35.930
to ask of me... well, anything.

31:35.931 --> 31:40.334
Anton, I would never use your
daughter as a bargaining chip.

31:40.335 --> 31:42.603
ANTON: I appreciate that.

31:42.604 --> 31:46.640
But the president's
original offer still stands.

31:46.641 --> 31:49.910
Give us information, and we'll
find a way to get you your cash.

31:49.911 --> 31:51.178
It's impossible.

31:51.179 --> 31:53.581
I can't give you anything
that would hurt Russia.

31:53.582 --> 31:57.684
I can't give you anything that
could be traced back to me.

32:01.188 --> 32:03.524
I wanted to be president, Elizabeth.

32:03.525 --> 32:05.559
I was also hoping that it
would mark the beginning

32:05.560 --> 32:09.563
of a better relationship
between our two countries.

32:09.564 --> 32:12.933
I am truly sorry that it could not be.

32:12.934 --> 32:17.570
Anton, I believe the
wheel is still turning.

32:29.561 --> 32:30.562
Good morning.

32:30.563 --> 32:31.829
Morning.

32:34.933 --> 32:35.934
Alison.

32:35.935 --> 32:38.670
I'm sorry.

32:38.671 --> 32:41.640
I'm sorry if I ever
made you feel invisible

32:41.641 --> 32:45.644
or unimportant or unheard

32:45.645 --> 32:47.646
or anything other than cherished.

32:47.647 --> 32:51.583
Because... that is what you are.

32:51.584 --> 32:53.217
Okay?

32:54.386 --> 32:55.888
Okay.

32:55.889 --> 33:00.225
You know, when I was growing up,
it seemed like the only thing

33:00.226 --> 33:02.895
that my parents ever talked
about was my brother

33:02.896 --> 33:05.931
and what new trouble
he was getting into,

33:05.932 --> 33:09.568
and it seemed like...

33:09.569 --> 33:12.271
like they took me for granted.

33:12.272 --> 33:16.041
And I swore that I would never
do that when I was a mom.

33:16.042 --> 33:18.844
I also swore I would never use pacifiers

33:18.845 --> 33:20.579
or disposable diapers.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.714
- But...
- (chuckles)

33:22.715 --> 33:24.917
Noodle, I'm not perfect, but I am trying,

33:24.918 --> 33:27.019
and I need you bear with me, please?

33:27.020 --> 33:28.353
Please?

33:28.354 --> 33:30.655
I can do that.

33:32.491 --> 33:34.259
Thank you.

33:34.260 --> 33:37.296
So, Dash's real name is George Lasko.

33:37.297 --> 33:39.798
Interpol confirmed Lasko is wanted

33:39.799 --> 33:41.200
for cyber attacks he committed

33:41.201 --> 33:43.468
as a juvenile in his
home country of Algeria,

33:43.469 --> 33:46.171
but no one had connected him
to the Dash alias until now.

33:46.172 --> 33:48.140
How did you do it?

33:48.141 --> 33:49.741
Anton Gorev.

33:49.742 --> 33:52.211
Reading over Oliver's report,

33:52.212 --> 33:55.011
I that the Russian government hired Dash

33:55.012 --> 33:57.480
to cyber-attack Estonia in 2007.

33:57.481 --> 33:59.782
That's when Gorev was head of the GRU,

33:59.783 --> 34:01.217
and they would've handled the payment.

34:01.218 --> 34:03.786
Gorev told me they paid George Lasko

34:03.787 --> 34:04.987
five million in cash.

34:04.988 --> 34:07.989
Did you happen to discuss
any current events?

34:08.558 --> 34:09.826
The Air Force One attack.

34:09.827 --> 34:12.128
He says it wasn't the Russians.

34:12.129 --> 34:14.297
What else can he say?

34:14.297 --> 34:16.065
Well, it's also possible
that it was them,

34:16.065 --> 34:18.000
and Gorev was just out of the loop.

34:18.001 --> 34:20.036
When Air Force One was hacked,

34:20.036 --> 34:21.737
President Ostrov was sick.

34:21.737 --> 34:24.706
It's possible the attack
was ordered by the generals,

34:24.708 --> 34:27.009
or Maria, bypassing government channels.

34:27.010 --> 34:29.478
She strikes me as the type to go rogue.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.580
I've got Interpol

34:30.581 --> 34:32.447
working to track Lasko down.

34:32.449 --> 34:34.154
Hopefully they can grab him up

34:34.155 --> 34:35.751
before he can execute
his second attack on us.

34:35.752 --> 34:37.386
And don't worry, Bess.

34:37.387 --> 34:39.722
Anton Gorev's help today will
stay with the three of us.

34:39.723 --> 34:43.126
Along with the fact that
you're harboring his daughter.

34:43.127 --> 34:45.627
I prefer to call it "hosting."

34:46.795 --> 34:50.166
Mr. President, aside
from keeping Olga safe,

34:50.167 --> 34:52.268
I would like to give Anton Gorev

34:52.268 --> 34:54.704
something else in exchange for his help.

34:54.705 --> 34:57.173
Something, I think, could
benefit all of us.

34:57.174 --> 34:58.875
Something like $80 million?

34:58.876 --> 35:00.575
Yes, sir.

35:01.644 --> 35:03.446
Go ahead.

35:03.447 --> 35:05.615
Sir Richard can close the deal.

35:05.616 --> 35:06.983
Thank you.

35:06.984 --> 35:08.217
And, uh,

35:08.218 --> 35:10.051
good work.

35:10.786 --> 35:12.387
Thank you, sir.

35:17.102 --> 35:19.262
_

35:21.164 --> 35:23.191
_

35:23.732 --> 35:25.036
_

35:25.302 --> 35:26.545
_

35:27.249 --> 35:28.069
_

35:32.449 --> 35:33.711
_

35:52.186 --> 35:56.702
- No, oh. 23 years of marriage means nothing
to this woman. - She's coming for you, Dad.

35:56.703 --> 35:59.567
- I'm so sorry.
- You are not sorry, Elizabeth McCord.

35:59.568 --> 36:01.236
- You are not sorry.
- OLGA: #Sorrynotsorry,

36:01.237 --> 36:02.905
right, Mrs. McCord?

36:02.906 --> 36:04.039
(phone buzzing)

36:04.040 --> 36:05.641
(sighs) Okay.

36:05.642 --> 36:07.176
You just sorried yourself.

36:07.177 --> 36:09.477
Hello?

36:13.382 --> 36:15.150
When did it happen?

36:15.151 --> 36:17.452
(laughter)

36:18.153 --> 36:19.989
All right.

36:19.990 --> 36:22.357
Thanks for letting me know.

36:26.862 --> 36:29.163
It's Gorev.

36:32.268 --> 36:34.268
Olga.

36:44.346 --> 36:45.948
It's your dad.

36:45.949 --> 36:49.218
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

36:49.219 --> 36:50.653
(crying)

36:50.654 --> 36:52.954
Come, come, come.

37:08.898 --> 37:11.940
_

37:13.059 --> 37:15.297
_

37:25.290 --> 37:26.791
How are you doing?

37:26.792 --> 37:28.526
Not so well.

37:28.527 --> 37:30.095
But, uh,

37:30.096 --> 37:32.097
sober, at least.

37:32.098 --> 37:34.398
I heard the news.

37:35.567 --> 37:37.068
Gorev is dead.

37:37.069 --> 37:38.737
The police in London are saying

37:38.738 --> 37:40.738
it was a pay dispute with his aide.

37:42.207 --> 37:43.520
Perhaps later I will arrange

37:43.521 --> 37:45.254
for you to buy the Manhattan Bridge.

37:45.255 --> 37:46.822
Brooklyn Bridge.

37:46.823 --> 37:48.624
But I agree with you...

37:48.625 --> 37:50.625
Anton Gorev was assassinated.

37:55.397 --> 37:57.465
And there's something
I didn't tell you before.

37:58.534 --> 38:00.868
Something else I heard at the embassy.

38:03.806 --> 38:05.441
It's all planned.

38:05.442 --> 38:07.109
The invasion.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.478
As soon as Maria Ostrov is elected,

38:09.479 --> 38:11.813
Russia will attack Western Ukraine.

38:22.158 --> 38:25.561
There are good people
in this country, Dmitri.

38:25.562 --> 38:27.930
People who want peace.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.532
They're working for it every day.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.833
I believe you are one of them.

38:40.695 --> 38:43.445
ELIZABETH: Are you sure you don't want
to <i>just stay a little bit longer?</i>

38:43.446 --> 38:45.848
Olga, the situation at
home is very unstable.

38:45.849 --> 38:48.083
And I think that if Maria
Ostrov gets it into her mind...

38:48.084 --> 38:52.353
I have to go back to
Russia to bury my father.

38:59.495 --> 39:02.498
And whatever happens,

39:02.499 --> 39:04.967
I can't give up on my country yet.

39:04.968 --> 39:08.036
Not when he sacrificed so much.

39:09.171 --> 39:12.240
He was very proud of you.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.511
Thank you.

39:15.512 --> 39:16.912
(sighs)

39:16.913 --> 39:18.247
And, uh,

39:18.248 --> 39:21.116
thank your family.

39:21.117 --> 39:23.619
I hope when Dr. McCord took me in,

39:23.620 --> 39:25.154
that didn't cause you any trouble.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.555
No, no.

39:26.556 --> 39:29.491
Dr. McCord always does
what he believes is right.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.759
That's why I love him so much.

39:32.761 --> 39:35.763
Look, you have a safe flight and...

39:43.939 --> 39:46.240
(door opens)

39:48.978 --> 39:50.578
(sighs)

39:52.381 --> 39:54.682
(clattering)

39:58.554 --> 39:59.788
Hey.

39:59.789 --> 40:01.523
What are you doing?

40:01.524 --> 40:02.791
I'm weeding.

40:02.792 --> 40:04.393
You... What?

40:04.394 --> 40:07.630
That's what fashion people
call cleaning out your closet.

40:07.631 --> 40:10.099
The rule is if you haven't
worn it in a year,

40:10.100 --> 40:11.267
it has to go.

40:11.268 --> 40:13.035
It's midnight.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.272
Did you know that if
you have big shoulders

40:16.273 --> 40:18.140
you can't wear boxy jackets?

40:18.141 --> 40:20.276
And if you have orange in your skin,

40:20.277 --> 40:21.543
you have to stay away

40:21.544 --> 40:23.279
from anything in the pink family.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.880
Okay.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.116
You don't have boxy shoulders

40:27.117 --> 40:29.317
or orange skin, so.

40:30.419 --> 40:32.655
Did you know that our
daughter knows all this stuff?

40:32.656 --> 40:33.822
I didn't.

40:33.823 --> 40:36.457
(sighs)

40:37.760 --> 40:39.295
Did you know that she sketches?

40:39.296 --> 40:41.963
Yeah.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.968
Not me.

40:50.472 --> 40:53.409
Alison thinks I'm not interested in her.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.577
And you know why she thinks that?

40:55.578 --> 40:57.279
(sighs)

40:57.280 --> 40:59.381
Because she's not a crisis.

40:59.382 --> 41:01.784
And that's what I do.

41:01.785 --> 41:05.454
I deal with one crisis
after another crisis

41:05.455 --> 41:06.889
after another,

41:06.890 --> 41:09.291
while my life

41:09.292 --> 41:11.826
just passes by.

41:13.495 --> 41:14.830
Babe,

41:14.831 --> 41:16.065
Alison is okay.

41:16.066 --> 41:17.266
You guys had a fight.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.000
It's over.

41:18.001 --> 41:20.369
I...

41:20.370 --> 41:23.438
What is this really about?

41:25.808 --> 41:28.243
You think you have your eye on the ball,

41:28.244 --> 41:32.180
and then you just end
up missing everything.

41:33.415 --> 41:35.050
And how am I supposed to guard

41:35.051 --> 41:37.885
against things I never even see coming?

41:40.756 --> 41:42.758
Effect real change in the world.

41:42.759 --> 41:44.226
That was Conrad's pitch.

41:44.227 --> 41:46.228
I didn't go looking for the job.

41:46.229 --> 41:48.663
And... (sighs)

41:50.799 --> 41:54.101
I know you feel bad about Anton.

41:55.237 --> 41:57.005
I feel bad about him, too.

41:57.006 --> 41:59.708
Please don't say anything about God.

41:59.709 --> 42:01.276
(chuckles)

42:01.277 --> 42:03.544
I wasn't going to.

42:04.246 --> 42:06.547
(sniffles)

42:10.886 --> 42:12.020
What happened?

42:12.021 --> 42:14.123
Mikhail Bozek was on his private plane,

42:14.124 --> 42:15.257
headed back to Ukraine.

42:15.258 --> 42:17.638
They went down about 100
miles west of Kiev.

42:17.639 --> 42:19.138
Rescue teams are on the scene.

42:19.139 --> 42:20.521
OLIVER: The president and his crew

42:20.522 --> 42:22.490
managed to bail out before
the plane hit the ground.

42:22.491 --> 42:24.125
We're waiting for...

42:24.126 --> 42:26.194
Here they are.

42:26.195 --> 42:27.729
President Dalton?

42:27.730 --> 42:29.063
DALTON: Yes, Mikhail.

42:29.064 --> 42:30.765
I'm here with Craig Sterling
and Elizabeth McCord.

42:30.766 --> 42:32.233
Are you all right?

42:32.234 --> 42:35.136
We're all okay, but it's a miracle.

42:35.137 --> 42:37.449
Mr. President, can you describe
what happened with the plane?

42:37.450 --> 42:40.384
There was some kind of malfunction.

42:40.385 --> 42:42.961
The autopilot suddenly programmed itself

42:42.962 --> 42:44.462
to drop 20,000 feet,

42:44.463 --> 42:47.665
and our pilot couldn't shut it down.

42:47.666 --> 42:50.535
We had parachutes on
board, and we bailed out.

42:50.536 --> 42:52.337
The plane crashed on empty land.

42:52.338 --> 42:53.671
So no one was killed?

42:53.672 --> 42:55.807
No, no, thank God. (chuckles)

42:55.808 --> 42:58.142
We were very lucky.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.478
You should have the medic
check you out, Mikhail.

43:00.479 --> 43:03.246
We'll talk tomorrow.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.717
Yes, that's a good idea.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.255
Just like Air Force One.

43:10.256 --> 43:12.523
This was Dash's next attack.

43:12.524 --> 43:14.192
ELIZABETH: Well, whoever hired Dash

43:14.193 --> 43:16.094
to hack your plane

43:16.095 --> 43:18.896
just tried to assassinate
the Ukrainian president.

43:18.897 --> 43:20.865
Then it must be the Russians.

43:20.866 --> 43:22.700
No one else has motive

43:22.701 --> 43:24.535
to attack both the US and Ukraine.

43:24.536 --> 43:27.038
Maria Ostrov is crossing
names off her enemies' list

43:27.039 --> 43:28.373
on her way to becoming president.

43:28.374 --> 43:30.275
With Anton Gorev dead,

43:30.276 --> 43:32.142
there's no one left to stop her.

43:36.311 --> 43:42.763
