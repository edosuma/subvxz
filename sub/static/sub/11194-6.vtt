00:42.080 --> 00:43.600
(gunfire)

00:43.760 --> 00:45.600
Major! Come on!

00:48.520 --> 00:50.440
We gotta go back for the general!

00:50.600 --> 00:54.800
I can't shut it down. I won't find
this window again. We have to go now!

01:05.680 --> 01:08.240
You sure this is the right one to go to?

01:08.840 --> 01:11.600
- It's better than the alternative.
- (alarm)

01:11.760 --> 01:13.720
I guess we'll see about that.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.200
Drop your weapons.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.880
Do it now!

01:32.000 --> 01:36.200
I'm Dr Samantha Carter
from the SGA. This is Major Kawalsky.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.680
We need to speak to your commander.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.360
So, what's the big emer...?

02:49.080 --> 02:50.600
Whoa!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.840
What happened to you?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.600
Jack.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.400
Jack?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.800
It's me. It's Sam.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.920
Uh...

03:05.280 --> 03:07.000
Yeah.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.880
I never expected this variation.
You're alive.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.520
Don't feel so bad, Colonel. Everybody
around here is telling me the same thing.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.080
Kawalsky?

03:21.240 --> 03:25.200
- In a manner of speaking.
- Actually, in a manner of fact, sir.

03:25.360 --> 03:30.200
This is Major Kawalsky in almost every
physical respect: blood, dental records.

03:30.360 --> 03:35.280
But I'm not supposed to be alive in this
reality any more than you are in mine.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.080
Sorry, Sam.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.600
It's not the same with us here, is it?

03:44.520 --> 03:49.360
Does... anyone wanna let me know
what the hell's goin' on here? Anyone?

03:49.520 --> 03:53.000
They appeared a few hours ago
in a Nellis high-security lockup.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.080
That quantum mirror
you got locked up at Area 51?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.040
You guys never figured out how to use it?

04:01.920 --> 04:07.040
Is he talking about that... alternate-reality
thing Daniel futzed with on 233?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.360
- Who's Daniel?
- (Sam) We can't be followed. Don't worry.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.520
We brought the remote with us.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.120
I've ordered it sent here
under heavy guard.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.240
Where we come from, the Goa'ulds
just took over the world, Colonel.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.000
Look, I've told you this. Now let me talk
to someone from the SGA.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.480
(man) SGA? There is
no such organisation.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.520
Then you call it something else.
The Stargate Project. Stargate Command.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.560
- What do you know about the Stargate?
- What do I know?!

04:38.720 --> 04:41.600
Everything! We've been through this!

04:41.760 --> 04:45.080
- Well, let's go through it again.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

04:46.280 --> 04:49.600
It's a big, round thing.
It takes you to other planets.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.640
I made it work four years ago and
we have explored the galaxy ever since.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.600
Until yesterday, when the Goa'uld started
taking over every major city from orbit...

04:58.760 --> 05:00.680
..and enslaving the population.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.080
Oh, my God. This is too weird.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.040
Yeah. How about that hair?

05:08.800 --> 05:12.120
She claims to have travelled
from an alternate universe...

05:12.280 --> 05:15.160
..in the same manner
Dr Jackson experienced a year ago.

05:15.320 --> 05:19.160
This can't be the Dr Carter I met
in the alternate reality. She's... dead.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.400
All right. Uh... just to clarify.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.080
This Carter is from an alternate...
alternate reality?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.280
Apparently.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.360
Anybody else have a problem with that?

05:33.280 --> 05:36.960
- Which reality is actually real?
- Thank you, Teal'c.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.160
She explains it.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.520
Look, I know this is hard
for you to understand.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.800
But, according to quantum theory,
for every universe...

05:48.960 --> 05:54.120
..there are infinite variations, diverging at
each choice we make like forks in a road.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.640
(man) Uh-huh.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.000
- She's right.
- You just agreed with yourself.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.080
No, Major Carter agreed with Dr Carter.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.000
She never joined the military
in her reality.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.040
Fork-in-the-road stuff?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.360
- Apparently.
- All right.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.880
So it's possible there's
an alternate version of myself...

06:15.040 --> 06:18.440
..that understands
what the hell you're talkin' about?

06:18.600 --> 06:22.960
They've asked to be debriefed.
I'd like you all to participate.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.360
Show them in.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.760
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Kawalsky!

06:38.600 --> 06:40.320
He's a member of SG-1 .

06:40.480 --> 06:42.160
Who the hell are you?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.200
Oh, um, I'm...

06:44.360 --> 06:46.920
..Daniel Jackson. Also a member of SG-1 .

06:48.520 --> 06:50.400
Have a seat, Major.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.960
(clears throat)

07:05.880 --> 07:07.480
Nice... hair.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.600
Uh... Air Force.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.200
I can't imagine that - going military.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.800
Wow! I can't imagine not.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.120
(Hammond) First of all, I would like to say
we know what you've been through.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.000
Dr Jackson experienced
a similar alternate reality...

07:29.160 --> 07:31.920
..some time ago on a mission to P3X-233.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.800
That's where we found
our quantum mirror, too.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.280
Fortunately for us, Dr Jackson
was able to return with intelligence...

07:39.440 --> 07:43.920
..that enabled SG-1 to stop
the Goa'uld attack here on Earth.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.440
Nice.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.800
That explains why your reality looked like
it hadn't been overrun by the Goa'uld.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.240
Actually, the very differences between
our universes contributed to our survival.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.120
Daniel's participation in the programme.
Teal'c's change of heart.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.600
The fact that I joined the military.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.120
You think your being in the Air Force
made that big a difference?

08:06.280 --> 08:09.880
- No. I just said it made a contribution.
- And therefore I didn't.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.520
Ladies... Sams...

08:12.680 --> 08:15.800
We're all in this reality together.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.840
(Hammond) What we need to know
is where you intend to go from here.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.560
Our Beta site buried their Stargate
once the last man stepped through.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.960
Our own world is under Goa'uld control
so we can't go back.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.560
We want to stay.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.240
That is... if we're wanted.

08:39.280 --> 08:44.120
We just left behind everyone we know,
everyone we ever cared about.

08:44.280 --> 08:48.040
If you're not gonna give us
a second chance, I don't know any of you.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.280
Exactly. You don't know any of us.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.640
And we don't know you. For all we know,
you could be her evil twin.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.360
But then we'd be dealing with cliches,
and you know how I feel about those.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.280
No, actually, you know
how I feel about those.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.720
OK.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.120
I'll speak with my superiors
and make a determination.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.680
For now, you'll be assigned
temporary accommodations.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.760
Take them to A3 quarters.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.160
I didn't mean to offend you back there.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.320
I'm the one dealing with inadequacy
issues here. Just forget about it.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.880
What?

09:30.040 --> 09:34.520
We knew the Goa'uld were coming for six
months. I couldn't think how to stop them.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.200
You did.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.080
- I'll be outside if you need me, ma'am.
- Of course you will.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.520
Yes, sir.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.400
I understand, sir.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.040
Thank you, sir.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.520
They can stay.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.440
- That was quick.
- Too quick.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.920
God knows what we're getting into.

10:42.080 --> 10:46.560
The combined IQ of Earth might go up
a few points having two Carters around.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.040
I take it you figure there's a down side.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.120
It just doesn't sit right.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.160
Some lines aren't meant to be crossed.
Nonetheless,...

10:59.320 --> 11:04.040
..l've been encouraged to find a way
to incorporate them into this command.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.120
OK.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.200
Um... in the meantime,
do you want me to tell 'em?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.320
Very well.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.360
(knock at door)

11:19.480 --> 11:23.360
Just put it on the table
and close the door on your way out.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.200
I'm sorry. Put what on the table?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.520
Jack!

11:29.280 --> 11:30.800
I'm sorry. Come in.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.720
Your... your Dr Fraiser
keeps insisting that I eat something.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.520
Ah. Well, she's your Doc Fraiser now, too.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.800
You're in. They said yes.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.200
That's good.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.760
Yeah! I can see you're overjoyed.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.320
I just never expected this. It's so...

11:59.480 --> 12:00.920
..so hard.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.600
Uh...

12:06.280 --> 12:08.160
Look...

12:09.600 --> 12:13.680
I can't even begin to know
what you've been through. I...

12:14.800 --> 12:16.520
I know you've lost a lot.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.400
I lost you.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.640
I watched you die, Jack.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.280
Three days ago,
trying to defend the mountain.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.480
And here you are, alive and safe
in this perfect world,...

12:30.640 --> 12:32.600
..and you don't even know me.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.320
Well, l...

12:39.880 --> 12:42.440
I sort ofknow you.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.400
You know her.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.200
You don't even see her that way, do you?

12:55.680 --> 12:58.560
I take it, where you're from, we were...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.560
Married.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.160
Ah.

13:07.080 --> 13:11.720
- This makes you uncomfortable.
- No, no, not at all. I just...

13:11.880 --> 13:14.360
- I get confused.
- (knock at door)

13:14.520 --> 13:16.720
- (door opens)
- Ma'am?

13:16.880 --> 13:19.200
Sorry, Colonel. I didn't realise.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.680
- Just... put it on the table, Airman.
- Yes, sir.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.200
Close the door on your way out.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.400
I haven't had a hot meal in forever.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.040
It was a couple of weeks ago.
We were celebrating our first anniversary.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.720
We got the call that the Goa'uld ships had
been spotted entering our solar system.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.600
We just left everything.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.920
You blew out the candles
and I turned off the oven and...

14:00.080 --> 14:01.920
..we just left.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.440
They didn't hit Colorado Springs
from orbit like most of the big cities so...

14:08.600 --> 14:10.680
..the table must still be set.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.120
Cold by now.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.160
Yeah.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.800
Listen, um...

14:21.160 --> 14:23.720
- I should probably be...
- Stay!

14:24.440 --> 14:26.400
- Sam...
- Please.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.600
Look...

14:30.760 --> 14:34.760
You're dealing with a loss right now
that I can't even begin to...

14:36.160 --> 14:38.600
Maybe I'm not the right person
to help you.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.760
Yes, you are.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.160
You're the only one who can.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.840
Look...

14:48.480 --> 14:52.760
I know you well enough to know
that you don't have a clue what to say.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.760
But you don't have to say anything.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.880
Come here.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.480
Oh, I miss him.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.920
Sir. General Hammond told me the news.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.200
- I've informed Major Kawalsky.
- Thank you.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.840
I was just on my way to do that.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.160
I thought I'd drop in on, uh...

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
..Samantha. See how she's doing.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.000
She's fine.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.120
I think she'd rather be left alone
at the moment.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.720
- Just stop in tomorrow.
- Oh. All right.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.800
- Well, good night, sir.
- Carter?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.120
Yes, sir?

15:57.480 --> 15:59.520
How are you doing with this...

16:00.440 --> 16:01.880
..twin thing?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.400
Do you have a couple of hours?

16:07.560 --> 16:09.200
OK.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.720
That was the answer.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.240
Oh, oh.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.920
Good night, sir.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.360
Good night, Major.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.200
(distant voices)

16:40.080 --> 16:41.600
(louder voices)

16:53.080 --> 16:55.000
(monitor beeping)

16:57.360 --> 16:59.440
What is it?

16:59.600 --> 17:03.200
- What's happening?
- Dr Carter's gone into convulsive shock.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.400
I don't know the cause
and I don't know how to stop it.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.079
Easy.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.200
Aarrghh!

17:16.359 --> 17:18.960
Not medical. Temporal.
Entropic cascade failure.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.960
- On the cellular level?
- Yes. I thought it would take years.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.880
- A side effect of travel through the mirror.
- Then why don't I have it?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.359
I'm guessing Dr Carter has it
because I'm here.

17:28.520 --> 17:32.840
Both of us existing in the same reality
theoretically causes temporal distortion.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.560
- Not theoretical any more.
- OK. So then how do I treat this?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.760
You can't.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.720
The more time passes,
the worse it should get.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.800
- So I'm gonna die here.
- You're not gonna die.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.040
- Actually, sir...
- Carter.

17:46.200 --> 17:50.800
- She won't only if we send her back.
- If you do, the Goa'uld will kill her.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.920
(Daniel) Think about it:
billions of people enslaved.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.640
I can't help but feel, in the grand scheme
of things, we owe them.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.080
The only way to help Dr Carter
is to stop the Goa'uld in her reality and...

18:06.240 --> 18:09.840
- ..save whatever's left.
- How do you suggest we do that?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.920
The resources of their entire world
couldn't defend against the Goa'uld.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.640
What about the resources of our world?

18:16.920 --> 18:20.000
- What do we have that they don't?
- Our fate.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.920
We made contact with the Asgard.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.000
So?

18:25.160 --> 18:28.240
So, if Dr Carter
can contact the Asgard in her reality,...

18:28.400 --> 18:30.360
..maybe their Asgard will help them.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.160
- Defend their world against the Goa'uld?
- Yes.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.440
And just how do you propose
we raise the Asgard, in their reality?

18:38.520 --> 18:42.200
We still have the dialling program
that took you to the Asgard home planet.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.000
Which we could download
to a removable hard drive.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.760
But that still won't do it.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.320
In order to dial the Asgard home world,...

18:49.480 --> 18:54.200
..they provided us with a generator to
transfer energy to the gate's capacitors.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.120
I can't get it to work again.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.160
Apparently,
it was designed to work only once.

18:59.320 --> 19:04.160
Assuming Major Carter succeeds, it will
be hard to get Dr Carter to the Stargate...

19:04.320 --> 19:06.400
..without the Goa'uld stopping her.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.680
That's where I come in.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.000
Permission to join the briefing, sir?

19:22.080 --> 19:24.840
I'll get her to the Stargate.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.600
You think I'm gonna let her go alone?
She's my best friend's wife.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.920
You'll need someone
to hook up the power generator.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.120
And download the dialling program.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.560
You will also require my assistance.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.120
- We can handle this.
- No, Teal'c has a point.

19:52.280 --> 19:56.080
You said Teal'c led the assault
on the mountain in your reality.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.600
Couldn't we use something like that
to our advantage?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.560
Quite the military mind, Daniel Jackson.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.320
No, sir. I'm sorry. Teal'c can't go
any more than I can.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.160
Entropic cascade failure.

20:10.320 --> 20:15.160
If I go, there will still be two of me in one
reality. The same will be true with Teal'c.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.400
Dr Carter did not become ill
during her first 48 hours.

20:18.560 --> 20:23.400
If our mission is not complete within
that time, it is most likely we will be dead.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.200
Good point.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.560
Are you OK with all this, sir?

20:28.720 --> 20:32.280
If you feel confident you can pull this off,
I have no objection.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.200
But on your return,
destroy that quantum mirror.

20:35.360 --> 20:40.680
OK, but we can't go anywhere unless we
get that Asgard generator working again.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.840
OK. Carter, download the program
to the removable whatever-it-is and...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.560
..meet me and yourself in the lab.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.440
Yes, sir.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.200
This is incredible.
If the Asgard could design this,...

21:00.360 --> 21:03.320
..they're just the little green men
we're looking for.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.040
They're grey, actually.
Roswell Grey, to be exact.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.200
I had a hard time trying to figure out
how it worked the first time.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.800
If it's powered by the energy
of a staff weapon, why doesn't it...

21:15.960 --> 21:21.080
Blow up? I'd guess it creates a modulated
dampening field round the naqahdah cell.

21:21.240 --> 21:26.280
Which controls the energy transfer.
Throwing it out each time it's activated.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.840
Yes, but how do you recalibrate a field
that you can't generate in the first place?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:34.080 --> 21:36.920
Are you Carters
gonna be able to figure this out?

21:37.080 --> 21:38.760
(both) We'll figure it out.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.400
Aarghh!

21:50.280 --> 21:52.200
We have to figure it out.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.600
OK, the way Dr C explained it,
the controller is not an exacting science.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.360
You can't dial up an address
like on a Stargate.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.920
- You have to figure out where you are.
- Not a very expedient way to get home.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.600
If it's not turned off,
it's always connected to the same reality.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.160
So when it's on again, it won't be
connected to the reality you came from?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.720
Right. We'd have to find it again.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.000
Now, this thing switches
to the various realities.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.520
If I turn it on now, it should come up
somewhere near the reality it was last on.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.520
There. See?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.840
That's not it. No grenade damage.

22:30.480 --> 22:35.680
I tossed a grenade to slow them down so
they didn't see us go through the mirror.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.720
So we need to find a reality
that's just right.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.800
- Do you mind if l...?
- Oh!

22:45.480 --> 22:48.400
There. See?
You probably turned it the wrong way.

22:48.560 --> 22:52.160
Since this device should be
in a storage closet in my reality,...

22:52.320 --> 22:53.680
..dial it the other way.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.400
Change it! Change it! Change it!

22:59.840 --> 23:02.160
OK! Closer.

23:02.320 --> 23:07.600
- You wanna dial it in smaller increments.
- Daniel? You understand this thing?

23:07.760 --> 23:09.680
- I think so.
- Good.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.800
Colonel!

23:11.960 --> 23:14.120
- We did it!
- Already?

23:14.280 --> 23:18.120
All we needed was the ratio decay rate
of naqahdah relative to the energy output.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.880
I calculated it when I learned about
our new generator. Just the ratio...

23:22.040 --> 23:24.800
Agh! It works, right?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.840
- It works.
- Good.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.200
I guess we'd better go do this.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.360
Yep, that's right. Looks like him.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.680
I am not fond
of wearing this uniform again.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.440
Well, I'm not too fond
of seeing you wear it.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.720
I've searched all the realities close
to ours. This matches your description.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.760
Yeah.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.640
- Wish I could go.
- Same here.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.880
But you don't wanna go through
a cascade tremor, believe me.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.240
- We made a good team, Major.
- Yeah, we did, Doctor.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.960
Plus your hair's kinda grown on me.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.800
Pardon the pun.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.800
You'd better go.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.600
I'll be here in case
you need anything from this side, sir.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.680
All right.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.920
On three.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.000
One,...

24:27.160 --> 24:28.120
..two,...

24:28.280 --> 24:29.200
..three.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.360
(alarm)

24:34.920 --> 24:38.160
(marching troops approach)

25:48.680 --> 25:50.800
Jaffa!

26:14.520 --> 26:16.000
Jaffa!

26:20.680 --> 26:22.200
Kree!

26:35.880 --> 26:37.800
(metallic object drops)

26:39.600 --> 26:41.320
Lonok.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.800
Kronok, Jaffa!

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
Jaffa! Kree!

26:52.560 --> 26:53.880
Jaffa!

27:04.160 --> 27:07.760
- Kel nok, Teal'c.
- Kel shak?

27:07.920 --> 27:12.840
Renounce Apophis as a false god. Join us
in delivering this world and I'll spare you.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.160
Shol'va!

27:25.920 --> 27:28.360
The idea was to zat him.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.520
As I said, O'Neill.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.360
Ours is the only reality of consequence.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.000
Jaffa, kree!

27:51.880 --> 27:53.400
Kel toc no.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.080
- OK, I gotta know.
- Yes. I'm about to activate it.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.120
No, no, no. Not that.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.200
What the hell does kree mean?

28:10.360 --> 28:12.840
Well, actually, it means a lot of things.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.840
Uh, loosely translated it means
"attention", "Iisten up", "concentrate".

28:18.000 --> 28:20.440
- "Yoo-hoo"?
- Yes, in a manner of speaking.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.880
- Oh.
- OK. Here goes.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.480
That's what I was afraid of. When I
turned off the device, it lost its place.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.600
I have to find our reality again.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.760
All right. It's OK.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.840
We knew that might happen.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.400
Stay with it.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.200
(distorted) I will ask you this
one more time, human.

29:28.360 --> 29:32.200
What is the address of the planet
to which your leaders have fled?

29:32.360 --> 29:34.400
The place you call "Beta site".

29:35.680 --> 29:37.400
Aarrghh!

29:40.680 --> 29:43.000
Where have your leaders gone?

29:45.160 --> 29:46.480
Kel Apophis.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.280
Teal'c. Who is this?

29:52.680 --> 29:55.440
She was captured
attempting an escape, my lord.

29:57.600 --> 30:02.200
This one will not tell us the glyphs for the
planet where they've sent their leaders.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.080
Get it out of him.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.000
Or get it out of her.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.880
Yes, my lord.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.440
Attend to our lord.
I will take care of these.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.000
Kree, Jaffa!

30:22.240 --> 30:24.400
You might as well kill me.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.000
I would never do such a thing,
General Hammond.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.840
It's OK. You're not hallucinating.
He's from an alternate reality.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.720
- So that mirror thing worked?
- Yeah.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.240
But don't worry.
I won't say "I told you so."

30:39.400 --> 30:42.000
We should have tried it
a long time ago, Doctor.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.200
(rumbling)

30:48.000 --> 30:52.200
- They have landed on the mountain.
- We still have a chance to stop them.

30:52.360 --> 30:56.880
We'll attempt contact with aliens
from their reality. Enemies of the Goa'uld.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.560
Whoops! Too far.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.880
Come on, please.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.480
The Carters are smart
figuring that thing out, huh?

31:56.640 --> 31:59.240
You and Sam never had a thing
in your world, huh?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.680
Sam is a major in my world.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.840
Yeah, I know.
It's against regulations, right?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.360
- You two look pretty good together.
- Kawalsky?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.840
During your Special Ops training,
in your world,...

32:13.000 --> 32:15.160
..did they cover silence?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.240
Yes.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.520
You're a captain.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.480
Close.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.440
OK. Now.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.200
I hope your Jack
can get the transformer on line.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.720
It appears that he is.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.600
Prepare to go through the gate, Dr Carter.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.720
(kiss)

33:30.880 --> 33:32.600
Thank you, Teal'c.

33:44.280 --> 33:46.680
Jaffa! Kree hol mel!

33:46.840 --> 33:48.200
Hol mel, Jaffa!

33:57.680 --> 33:59.000
Teal'c.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.320
Why do you betray me?

34:40.080 --> 34:42.639
Lower your weapons or we will kill him.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.800
Colonel?

34:48.880 --> 34:50.880
Yeah, we should do that.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.440
Deja vu.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.520
Who are you?

35:22.520 --> 35:25.520
My First Prime killed you
before my very eyes.

35:25.680 --> 35:28.280
I'm feeling much better, thank you.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.960
Then who are you?

35:32.120 --> 35:33.520
What magic is this?

35:33.680 --> 35:36.400
You should know
there's no such thing as magic.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.240
Trey lan tonik.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.120
I will ask you one more time.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.600
How could you rise from the dead
without a sarcophagus?

35:52.480 --> 35:56.080
I'm guessin' the second shot kills
in this world too, huh?

35:56.240 --> 35:59.200
- Tell me what I want to know!
- Hey. I'd love to.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.480
But I don't understand it myself.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.120
He does.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.600
OK. I'll, uh... I'll give it a try. Um...

36:12.240 --> 36:15.840
At every point in time,
there are infinite possibilities.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.080
A parallel reality exists
for each possibility,...

36:20.240 --> 36:22.920
..so there are literally infinite branches...

36:23.480 --> 36:24.840
No! You...

36:27.360 --> 36:29.280
Kawalsky!

36:31.000 --> 36:34.320
- Tell me where you come from.
- From an alternate reality.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.960
One in which, by the way, you're dead.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.400
- Aw, come on!
- He told you everything he knows!

36:48.000 --> 36:49.440
My lord.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.360
Tel kol, Apophis.
Kree no tel, Reenlokia!

36:56.680 --> 36:57.920
(beeping)

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
Mel nok tee!

37:15.680 --> 37:17.440
OK, I'm guessin'...

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
- Asgard.
- All right.

37:24.680 --> 37:25.600
Kree!

37:49.560 --> 37:52.640
(rumbling)

38:11.960 --> 38:13.960
It appears Dr Carter was successful.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.440
Come on. Ya gotta love those guys!

38:26.240 --> 38:29.560
- I met the Asgard.
- We guessed that.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.200
Love those guys.

38:52.840 --> 38:57.120
Colonel, it's been a pleasure
to serve with you... again.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.400
- Likewise.
- Right, right.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.160
This is hard. Goodbye for a second time.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.760
It's the first time.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.800
It doesn't feel that way to me.

39:27.480 --> 39:33.200
You have to understand. My Jack had
the same face, same voice, same hands.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.800
Which brings to mind
an obvious question.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.880
How could you marry such a loser?

39:48.760 --> 39:51.560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
