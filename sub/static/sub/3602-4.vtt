an excellent vocabulary.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.765
You know what?
I do have an excellent
vocabulary.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.475
And those novels
are the only romance
I'm getting these days.

19:55.570 --> 19:59.108
I will take that game
and I will challenge you,
little man. You are on.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.450
Why can't you just work
at home like usual?

20:04.329 --> 20:06.570
Because this job
is different.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.074
You've been different.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.406
I know I have.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.211
Come here.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.372
I'm so sorry.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.460
It has not been fair to you,
but you have been a trooper.

20:22.263 --> 20:27.053
But I have things under
control now. And I'm just
going to do this one thing,

20:27.477 --> 20:30.560
and it's going to solve a lot
of problems for us.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.185
Then you won't be
able to get rid of me.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.354
Fine. But it's safer
over the Internet.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.316
What?

20:41.408 --> 20:46.698
I mean, what you do,
I mean, in the garage,
it's just acting.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.700
None of it's for real.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.292
MICAH:
He sent a limo.

20:59.676 --> 21:04.010
Either he's a crap house rat,
as in "crazy as,"
or he's one of them.

21:04.639 --> 21:08.473
All he's really telling me
is that he can't do
anything. Crap house rat.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.849
Don't you want to
at least follow the smoke
and see if there's a fire?

21:15.191 --> 21:20.686
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Good luck with the whole
flying thing.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.186
Thanks.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.818
So, when you're with
your brother you can fly,

21:28.913 --> 21:31.746
and when you're
with the artist...
Isaac. Yeah.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.041
I only met him once,
but after I...

21:35.670 --> 21:37.206
I drew the future.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.253
And now you can't
do either.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.752
Maybe I can
only do things

21:41.843 --> 21:44.801
when I've around other people
who can do things.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.048
Did that sound as lame
as I think it did?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.225
It sounds like you should
be talking to my father.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.052
This was his research,
not mine.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.308
Where is he?
How do I get a hold of him?

21:56.399 --> 21:58.105
He's on the table.

22:04.407 --> 22:09.322
I'm sorry, but you believe
that this is possible.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.199
You have to,
you believed it
this morning.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.493
What if I prove it to you?

22:15.585 --> 22:17.075
Then prove it.

22:18.213 --> 22:21.000
We'll go see Nathan.
When I'm around him
I can fly.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.466
I've done it before.
Twice.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.506
Fine. Let's go see
your brother.

22:25.595 --> 22:29.429
Wait, he's in Vegas.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.764
Of course he is.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.763
Then I'll take you
to Isaac's.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.474
But it's complicated.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.942
Complicated how?

22:43.446 --> 22:44.606
Isaac.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.117
Paintings are by the door.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.618
I thought I was buying
the new pieces.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.213
I need the new pieces.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.709
Because they tell you
what's going to happen
in the future?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.836
How much for
the old paintings?

23:05.927 --> 23:08.714
To tell you the truth,
Isaac, I don't know
if I could sell those.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.966
So, you only like
the ones I painted
when I was high.

23:11.849 --> 23:16.058
Interesting.
Won't give me an advance?

23:16.145 --> 23:18.727
That depends.
What're you going
to do with the money?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.646
I need painting supplies.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.144
I take it you're not talking
about oils and canvas.

23:28.950 --> 23:34.070
It was raining last night.
What'd you do, Simone?
In the rain?

23:38.001 --> 23:39.741
You followed me?

23:39.836 --> 23:41.576
I drew that one weeks ago.

23:41.671 --> 23:45.289
I drew him there, and here,
before I'd ever met the guy.

23:50.138 --> 23:53.471
Are you in love with him?
Looks like you're
in love with him.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.264
I don't know
how I feel about him.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.051
And I don't know
how I feel about you.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.639
So here we are not knowing
how we feel about each other,

24:02.734 --> 24:04.395
and this entire city
is going to go...

by shooting up?

24:11.868 --> 24:13.608
I can save everybody.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.830
I'm going to be a hero.

24:28.593 --> 24:33.303
Look, you can't say anything.
I'm fine. I was drunk.
It was an accident.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.764
Which part was an accident,
the rape or the murder?

24:36.851 --> 24:38.216
It didn't happen.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.427
Yeah, because he killed you
before he had the chance.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.022
I'm alive.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.971
Yeah, now, but you weren't
on the autopsy table.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.018
Look, you said you had
a hole in your head.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.727
Maybe when they pulled out
whatever was in there,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.653
that's when you, like,
rebooted or whatever.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.943
I'm not a hard drive.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.827
Don't ever
call me that again.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.404
You've got to tell somebody
about Brody.

24:59.499 --> 25:04.664
No, I don't. And even if I
wanted to, which I don't,
I don't have a mark on me.

25:04.754 --> 25:06.460
But you know what happened,

25:06.589 --> 25:09.626
and he knows what happened.
All he knows is that
he was drunk,

25:09.717 --> 25:11.253
and I'm not dead.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.174
Hey, what happened
to you last night?

25:18.768 --> 25:22.556
I was hoping you'd tell me.
I had way too much to drink.

So, you're traveling alone,
are you?

do the talking to start.

He's kind of a heroin addict.

I don't know.
He took a pretty big leap.

I did more than respect it.
I believed him.

What are you doing
here so late?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.730
Making banners
for spirit week.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.572
Jackie was going
to give me a ride home
but she left without me.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.950
Can I get a lift?

39:33.413 --> 39:35.199
Yeah, I guess.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.114
Thanks.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.997
Hey, you drive
a stick shift, right?

39:43.131 --> 39:44.587
Can I drive?

39:56.937 --> 39:59.394
Don't you think it's a little
weird that neither
one of us remembers

39:59.481 --> 40:02.143
what happened
the night of the bonfire?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.774
Must have been
some night.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.563
Yeah, must have.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.776
Slow down.
That was a red light.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.443
Whoops.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.625
You know how to drive
a stick shift, don't you?

40:21.712 --> 40:23.373
There's a lot
of things that I know.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.129
Like what you did to me.

40:27.259 --> 40:31.593
What'd I do to you? I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.217
You get drunk,
you come on to me
and it's my fault?

40:35.309 --> 40:37.766
You're a liar.
You can't rape
the willing, Claire.

40:37.853 --> 40:41.141
You wanted it
as bad as I did.
Stop the car.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.351
Did I want it as bad
as Lori Trammel?

40:43.442 --> 40:45.478
Lori Trammel is a slut.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.984
Is that what you're
going to say about me?

40:48.071 --> 40:49.936
I already do.

40:50.032 --> 40:52.648
You're just going
to keep at it,
aren't you?

40:52.743 --> 40:56.577
You should let it go, Claire.
There's nothing
you can do about it.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.169
I can do this.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.540
(SCREAMING)

41:24.733 --> 41:26.189
Just take the one.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.368
(YELLING)

41:49.383 --> 41:50.668
(POUNDING)

42:14.366 --> 42:15.947
Peter Petrelli.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.822
How is this happening?

42:21.832 --> 42:23.823
I'm sorry if I scared you.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.208
You look different
without your scar.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.001
I don't know you, buddy.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.329
Not yet.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.758
My name is Hiro Nakamura.
I'm from the future.

42:37.514 --> 42:39.630
I have a message for you.
