~ <i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>
~ Joseph Michael Miller, how do you plead?

00:02.719 --> 00:04.710
~ Not guilty.
~ No!

00:04.760 --> 00:06.310
DS Miller attacked the defendant.

00:06.360 --> 00:09.030
We can't afford to
lose this confession.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.910
I am minded to exclude the
confession from evidence.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.710
Members of the jury, you are
to disregard it entirely.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.870
There were two girls,
Lisa Newbery, 19,

00:18.920 --> 00:22.070
was baby-sitting for her
12-year-old cousin, Pippa.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.310
Her parents went away for the
night to a friend's wedding.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.350
Next day, both girls were gone.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.390
Our main suspect was Lee Ashworth.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.509
~ Lee is my husband.
~ Claire needs to meet Ashworth.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.080
~ Let it go.
~ Then the families never get
truth, never get justice.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.070
It was like I was addicted
to him like he was my drug.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.190
~ What the hell are you doing?
~ If he walks because of you...

00:44.240 --> 00:46.240
Claire!

00:53.040 --> 00:56.320
~ Hey! Did you see a man and
woman come down just now?
~ No, mate.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.990
What are you doing?

01:09.040 --> 01:11.830
Checking the cameras. Ashworth
turned them off.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.550
~ Why didn't you see them?
~ I had Beth to deal with.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.790
What is the point of you? Give
me your keys. Car keys! Now!

01:17.840 --> 01:19.830
You're not supposed to drive.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.070
I'm gonna look for them because you
didn't do what we agreed. Keys!

01:23.120 --> 01:25.630
No, this is not my fault.
Don't put this on me.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.190
I am sick of everyone putting their
shit on me when I'm not responsible.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.830
I'm sick to the back teeth of taking
flak for stuff I haven't done.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.870
Fine.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.510
You have the keys. I hope
you bloody well crash

01:37.560 --> 01:41.060
and have a heart attack
while you are crashing!

01:48.600 --> 01:50.600
Ungh!

01:52.960 --> 01:54.960
(GEARS GRINDING)

02:01.760 --> 02:04.430
Think, think, think. Where
would you take her?

02:04.480 --> 02:06.070
Where would you go?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.630
~ (GROANS)
~ Beth, what are you doing?

02:08.680 --> 02:11.110
Ellie, do not come near me.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.150
Have you phoned Mark?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.670
I haven't got my mobile,
I ran out cos of you.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.710
So I'll call him. Just take it slow.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.150
~ Were you having contractions
before your waters broke?
~ Get off me.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.190
Been having them for days on and off.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.830
Midwife kept saying they
were Braxton Hicks.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.750
~ He's on voicemail.
~ Course he bloody is.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.870
I'll call Lucy. Maybe she can
drive you to the hospital.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.910
I'm not going to the hospital.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.950
I'm having a home birth.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.790
~ What are you doing that for?
~ Will you just go away!

02:37.840 --> 02:39.950
You stupid cow I'm
trying to help you.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.800
You can't even walk, now, lean on me.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.560
~ I don't want you here.
~ Well, tough shit.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.640
Argh!

02:58.000 --> 03:00.190
The defendant's confession excluded,

03:00.240 --> 03:03.750
the defence impugning the integrity
of the police investigation.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.870
~ Are we worried?
~ Are you worried, Ben?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.910
Yes, a bit.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.510
Then don't be. We make our
case steadily and thoroughly.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.630
We do not get buffeted
by daily winds.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.670
I just...

03:16.720 --> 03:19.910
I wondered if we might recalibrate
our strategy, is all.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.790
We have facts on our side.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.830
Family, forensics,

03:24.880 --> 03:26.870
postmortem, communications,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.230
eyewitnesses, all strong, all good.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.590
Do we still call Ellie
Miller as a witness?

03:31.640 --> 03:33.630
Given what she did to her husband.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.670
We still have DI Hardy's evidence
to complete. I'll decide after that.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.350
Question is, will they call
DS Miller for the prosecution?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.990
Her credibility is damaged
with the beating.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.310
If it were me, I'd limit
the damage by not using her.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.230
Whereas we want her in the box
so we can take a run at her.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.270
Yes, we do.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.030
We should be able to argue for it as
she's on the back of the indictment.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.750
I worked out some thoughts
you might like to use on her.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.790
It's fine. I'll figure it out.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.910
Sure, but I've already done the work.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.750
~ So you might as well read it.
~ Abby, I'll do my own prep.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.790
Course. Right, yeah, good.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.110
Make your own way to
court in the morning.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.230
I've got an appointment first thing.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.790
I'll see you there.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.829
Argh!

04:16.880 --> 04:18.870
Mum? Mum!

04:18.920 --> 04:21.709
Chloe, help me get your mum
upstairs into the pool.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.000
~ Chlo, I don't want her here. Get her out.
~ Oh, shut up.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.710
Claire! Claire!

04:43.760 --> 04:45.750
Where is she? Argh!

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
Where is who?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.590
You bugged us.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.310
~ Where is Claire? What
have you done with her?
~ We're not suspects.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.350
~ We are not prisoners.
~ Get off him.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.510
~ You all right?
~ Course he's all right.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.910
~ I want you out.
~ Or what, you'll call the police?

05:02.960 --> 05:04.950
Out now!

05:05.000 --> 05:09.440
You don't set how long
I spend with my wife.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.990
Got it?

05:22.040 --> 05:25.430
Now, I will tell you everything
that you missed at Sandbrook

05:25.480 --> 05:28.020
when you stop pissing me about.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'll call you, babe.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.790
What the hell are you doing?

05:38.840 --> 05:40.830
Argh!

05:40.880 --> 05:42.870
All right.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.030
They are every 40 seconds apart
now. You're doing ever so well.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.080
~ (DOORBELL)
~ I'll go.
~ I need gas and air.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.950
~ Midwife is here.
~ Thank god for that.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.990
It's coming again.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.030
Breathe into it.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.960
Argh!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.710
~ Why the hell did you go with him?
~ Because I was terrified.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.510
I haven't seen him in a year and
a half and I did what he told me.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.230
~ You should have called me.
~ "Hang on, Lee, love.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.870
I'll give Alec a ring."

06:10.920 --> 06:14.230
~ Did you just jump out of the window?
~ Ran across a few gardens

06:14.280 --> 06:16.870
~ and flagged down a taxi.
~ You brought him here?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.830
~ The one place he doesn't know about.
~ I had no choice.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.150
You put cameras in there
without telling me.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.790
~ I wanted to know what he would say.
~ You don't trust me to tell you, no?

06:25.840 --> 06:27.830
You want to talk about truth? Yeah?

06:27.880 --> 06:29.870
What is this?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.910
Dunno.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.950
Yeah?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.200
Don't lie to me, Claire.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.030
It's a bluebell.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.550
It was sent to me like that...

06:43.120 --> 06:47.430
.. to... an old post office
box I used to use,

06:47.480 --> 06:51.080
when I did mail-order
hairdressing products. I...

06:52.400 --> 06:55.590
~ Who sent it?
~ I dunno.
~ What does it mean? Why did you keep it?

06:55.640 --> 06:59.110
So you'd have something to find when
sneaking through my cupboards.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.460
~ I don't want to talk to you. Get out.
~ Claire.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.270
If there is anything
you've not told me,

07:05.320 --> 07:08.120
about what happened with you and Lee,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.760
about Sandbrook,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
now is the time.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.990
What have you done?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.240
What have you done?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.940
I have told you everything.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
Get out.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.360
Argh!

07:45.360 --> 07:47.350
Argh!

07:47.400 --> 07:49.790
WOMAN: Just try slowly
breathing down a bit, Beth.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.670
~ You can go.
~ It's all right. I'll wait with you.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.710
Did you phone your dad?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.750
Yeah, no answer.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.790
Will she be all right?

07:58.840 --> 08:02.550
Yeah, she'll be fine. This is what
it's like, it just takes a while.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
Argh!

08:10.360 --> 08:12.560
Did you really not know?

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
About Joe and Danny?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.710
No.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.960
I'd have done something.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.400
How do you live with it?

08:25.960 --> 08:27.950
Don't have a choice.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.990
Like any of us.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.039
Argh!

What are you gonna do now?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.030
I dunno. Claire wouldn't talk to me.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.270
I'm gonna need you to talk to her.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.310
That can wait.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.670
Beth's just had her
baby. Little girl.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.710
Oh, that's nice.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.430
Tell 'em... congratulations.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.470

Well done, Mum. You all right?

Pethidine wears off.

Congratulations, Beth.

~ Sorry, Ell.
~ Do not apologise.

means I'm dosed up on painkillers.

~ Then we'll see whether there
are grounds for an appeal.
~ Right.

You've got to stay
positive about this.

Yeah?

OK.

Miss Knight. I hoped I'd catch you.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.310
It's your bill. It's still in
arrears. Quite large arrears.

~ Look, I'm in the middle of a case.
~ Absolutely.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.910

way to getting up to date...

~ Oh.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.070
She's no bother, no bother at all.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.360
Let me know how you'd like to settle.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.630
~ We're off to court.
~ Who is up today?

16:48.680 --> 16:50.670
More police evidence.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.990
You're clear on those
classified rates?

16:53.040 --> 16:55.030
Mag, I am loving this job.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.070
Don't we make a great team? Eh?

16:57.120 --> 16:59.510
~ Your paper is safe in my hands.
~ (KNOCKING)

16:59.560 --> 17:01.550
Oh, customer. Morning.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.960
~ What can we do you for?
~ See you, Mum.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.990
I er...

17:08.040 --> 17:10.240
Off, go on. Drive safely.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.440
I'd... I'd like to place
a small ad, please.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.550
Maintenance services.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.869
Yeah, course. Have a seat.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.550
Maybe you could help
me with something.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.590
I've just moved into the area.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.580
Where is the police
station from here?

17:59.560 --> 18:01.630
~ You all right?
~ Yeah.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.060
How do you think they are
getting on in there, eh?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.030
Is that the phone the
defendant was holding

18:26.080 --> 18:28.070
on the day you arrested him?

18:28.120 --> 18:30.630
Yes. It belonged to Danny Latimer.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.670
Danny had two phones.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.720
This one was given
to him by Mr Miller.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.200
What did you discover from the
call history on that phone?

18:40.200 --> 18:44.870
Only one number had ever called
or sent texts to Danny's phone.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.910
A mobile number belonging
to Mr Miller.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.230
When you took possession
of Mr Miller's computer,

18:51.280 --> 18:55.270
did you find further evidence of
communication between the defendant

18:55.320 --> 18:58.910
~ and Danny Latimer?
~ We found an email account
under a false name.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.430
Only used to send emails to Danny.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.470
You're being handed an exhibit.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.270
Exhibit MJC735 from
your jury bundles.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.710
Could you confirm that
these are printouts

19:10.760 --> 19:12.870
of the emails sent from this account?

19:12.920 --> 19:15.470
~ I can.
~ And would you read the email

19:15.520 --> 19:18.920
sent to Danny Latimer
on the 29th of May.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.710
"Great seeing you last night.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.110
Sorry things aren't
going well at home.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.150
Wanna meet again Thursday.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.190
It can stay between us."

19:28.240 --> 19:30.230
And on the 25th of June,

19:30.280 --> 19:32.270
from Danny to the defendant?

19:32.320 --> 19:34.710
"Why does nobody understand
me like you do?

19:34.760 --> 19:37.430
Have a great holiday. I miss you."

19:39.960 --> 19:41.960
Thank you.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.560
And the transcript of 16 May, please.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.180
"I know your dad will be
sorry for hitting you.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.960
You can talk to me any time."

20:00.240 --> 20:04.590
What evidence do you have to prove
that Mr Miller was using his phone

20:04.640 --> 20:07.110
at the time the calls
and messages were sent?

20:07.160 --> 20:10.030
They were sent from
his private number.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.230
Someone else could have picked
up the phone and used it.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.270
We believe it was Mr Miller.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.070
You believe rather than
you are able to prove?

20:18.120 --> 20:22.080
Phone mast records have placed
the phone at Mr Miller's house.

20:23.760 --> 20:28.310
The computer with the email account
used to correspond with Danny,

20:28.360 --> 20:30.350
was that a private computer?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.390
It was Mr Miller's home computer.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.630
It was the family
computer, wasn't it?

20:34.680 --> 20:37.280
~ Yes.
~ Was it password protected?

20:38.560 --> 20:42.310
No, but we believe Mr Miller was
the main user of the computer.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.350
But not the sole user

20:44.400 --> 20:46.390
because it was the family computer.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.190
Accessible to anyone who lived
in or visited the house.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.230
Well, I doubt the baby used it.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.430
I'm not keen on sarcasm, DI Hardy.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.990
~ Stick to the facts, please.
~ Course, my lady.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.070
Mr Miller's wife, DS Ellie Miller,

21:01.120 --> 21:05.070
an investigating officer, also
had access to the computer

21:05.120 --> 21:08.060
long before it was
seized, didn't she?

21:08.280 --> 21:11.390
~ Yes, but -
~ So anyone living in that house

21:11.440 --> 21:13.430
including Mr Miller's wife,

21:13.480 --> 21:15.470
your colleague,

21:15.520 --> 21:17.710
would have been able
to use the computer

21:17.760 --> 21:21.680
right up until the time of
Mr Miller's arrest. Yes or no?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.350
Yes.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
Thank you.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.830
Those barristers, who are they?

21:30.880 --> 21:33.950
They've never done anything of
worth. They are just sniping.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.710
~ What's been going on in there?
~ The whole system stinks.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.230
This is how people like
Ashworth get let off

21:39.280 --> 21:43.270
~ while decent people get
aspersions cast on them.
~ Aspersions about who?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.430
I can't. Not till you've
given evidence.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.590
Shut up, then. You're
making me nervous.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.230
I need you to be Claire's
best friend right now.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.790
Otherwise Ashworth will
work his way back in.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.230
~ Find out is he contacting her
or she him. Are you listening?
~ Bob.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.870
~ What are you doing here?
~ I'm not here for that.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.510
There's been an allegation
made against you, sir.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.830
For harassment, from a Lee
Ashworth. Said you imprisoned,

22:04.880 --> 22:07.470
illegally recorded and
physically attacked him.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.720
You need to come with me.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.160
(HAMMERING)

22:59.360 --> 23:01.630
I can't believe you
are making me do this.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.150
It's this or internal affairs.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.230
It's a fraught time for
everyone at the moment.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.270
See if we can work this one out.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.830
He took me to a house,
recorded me in private,

23:13.880 --> 23:15.950
then tracked me down and attacked me.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.510
~ You attacked me.
~ See? This is what he's like.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.500
What have you got
to say for yourself?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.480
I'm under a lot of
pressure currently.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.440
With the court case.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.430
I should not have done what I did.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.040
OK.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.070
Say sorry.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.120
What?

23:47.360 --> 23:49.360
Say... sorry.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.670
~ I'm sorry.
~ What's that?

23:55.720 --> 23:59.420
I'm sorry. I apologise for
any error of judgement.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.920
Right, so we'll say
no more about this.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.430
~ Are you coming?
~ I'm gonna walk.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.480
Suit yourself.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.550
What do you want?

24:29.600 --> 24:32.710
I know we messed up but how can
you say you need protecting

24:32.760 --> 24:34.750
~ and then run off with him?
~ I know.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.070
I should have been
stronger. I'm sorry.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.430
~ How are you doing?
~ I've been sat around
court these last few days

24:40.480 --> 24:42.590
not knowing if they
are gonna call me.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.710
I got my childminder to agree
to have Fred for the night.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.270
Got a bit of a crush on
each other at the moment.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.400
I thought I just want to get
hammered. What do you think?

24:57.040 --> 24:59.030
(BABY GURGLES)

24:59.080 --> 25:01.070
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:01.120 --> 25:04.510
I brought slightly posh biscuits.
You get loads of flowers.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.550
Oh, look at her.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.590
She's beautiful.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.670
~ Do you want a beer, mate?
~ No, I'm fine.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.710
Hello.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.750
Any names yet?

25:15.800 --> 25:18.270
Elizabeth. Lizzie.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.320
For Mum.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.950
Welcome to the world, Lizzie.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.590
~ What are you doing?
~ I was just welcoming...
~ Mark.

25:27.640 --> 25:31.160
No need, no. God is not in this
house, surely that's clear by now.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.510
~ I don't agree.
~ It's nothing against you.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.550
Just keep that bit separate.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.830
It can't be. It isn't.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.880
It is for me.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.870
There you go, ladies.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.790
~ Whoo.
~ I haven't been out drinking
in Weymouth for years.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.830
Like a teenager.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.870
Tell me about court.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.910
I have to sit there waiting.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.430
I'm not allowed to be
told what is happening

25:58.480 --> 26:01.670
so I keep looking at people's
faces trying to read clues.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.710
I just keep thinking of Joe,

26:03.760 --> 26:06.560
my husband sitting there in the dock.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.830
It's just...

26:08.880 --> 26:10.870
just a nightmare, it won't stop.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.870
I'm so sorry. Was it always Joe?

26:13.920 --> 26:17.320
Or did you ever have a
thing for someone else?

26:17.960 --> 26:19.950
There was this bloke at work once.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.990
Years back.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.030
I really fancied him.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.790
No, it wasn't that. I really
wanted to marry him.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.630
I just knew first time we
met, bam, really strong.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.390
~ So why didn't you?
~ He was ten years older than me.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.750
~ Already had a wife.
~ Did you ever tell him?

26:34.800 --> 26:36.790
No.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.350
I nearly told him at his leaving
do. But I thought, what's the point?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.870
Funny thing was as he
was leaving that night

26:42.920 --> 26:45.630
last thing he did, turned
around and looked at me

26:45.680 --> 26:47.670
and he gave me this smile.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.880
Of all the people in there
he turned and he looked at me.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.780
I think about that quite a lot now.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.110
Why didn't you do something?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.670
Just what happens, isn't
it? Life sweeps by,

26:59.720 --> 27:03.520
and before you know what
is going on, it's too late.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
I need the loo.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.990
Um...

27:51.040 --> 27:54.230
Two blokes eyeing us up
over my left shoulder.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.280
No.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.550
~ Oh, my god, you're right.
~ Which one do you prefer?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.910
No, I can't. I've never
done that before.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.950
Listen.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.310
The world is screwing
you over right now.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.700
You owe yourself something.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.860
When was the last time you had sex?

28:42.760 --> 28:45.230
We've got nothing more to say.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.960
I've got plenty to tell you.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.350
Notes, interviews,

28:52.400 --> 28:54.390
people's movements on that night.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.550
I knew you'd never
want to clear my name

28:56.600 --> 28:59.590
so I started working on it
myself. Talking to people.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.630
And they spoke to you?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.670
Well, I told 'em I was you.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.710
~ What?
~ Yeah.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.750
I know what it's like to be you now.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.790
Suspicious all the time.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.320
Must be really... eating away at you.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.190
~ Especially when you are wrong.
~ I should charge you

29:17.240 --> 29:20.840
~ with impersonating a police officer.
~ Go on, then.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.550
Ricky and David Gillespie.
Dads of the two girls.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.590
~ Two dads, two brothers. You
barely even looked at them.
~ I did.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.510
Not far enough. Lisa told
me Ricky made a move on her

29:35.560 --> 29:37.670
driving her home after baby-sitting.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.920
Made a pass at his niece?

29:40.640 --> 29:43.310
What about this guy seen
hanging around the estate?

29:43.360 --> 29:46.950
~ Never even proved he existed.
~ Reported by four separate women.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.990
None of this is new.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.870
Why would I kill a 12-year-old girl?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.960
Why was her pendant
found in your vehicle?

29:56.080 --> 29:59.440
We used to give her a lift to
school, as a favour to Cate.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.830
So it must have come off then.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.000
She was wearing it the day she died.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.950
~ You missed things.
~ You need to go. Go on.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.470
~ Get out.
~ Look at that stuff.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.510
Look at the Gillespies.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.070
Look at that bloke hanging
around the estate.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.120
~ Why did you send Claire a bluebell?
~ What?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.310
How'd I do that from France?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.960
Do bluebells even grow in France?

30:42.240 --> 30:44.990
Are we really doing this?

30:45.040 --> 30:47.030
I don't think I can do it.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.070
(GIGGLES)

30:49.120 --> 30:51.790
I drank much more than I meant to.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.750
Get off.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.790
Can we get rid of them?

30:56.840 --> 30:59.950
Where are we gonna go? My flat
is too tiny and miles away.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.990
We can go to mine.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.030
(MUMBLES)

31:04.080 --> 31:07.380
Here we go, here's one.
Taxi over here, mate!

31:07.680 --> 31:11.590
BEN: 'Jocelyn, please, tell me you're
not ringing with more requests,

31:11.640 --> 31:15.230
I'm only just getting through this
pile of documents you left me.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.990
You can't seriously expect
me to read all of these

31:18.040 --> 31:20.550
onto audio files for you
in time for tomorrow,

31:20.600 --> 31:22.590
it's already way past midnight.'

31:22.640 --> 31:24.630
Some of us are only just going home.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.950
If you'd done it all during the
day I wouldn't need to call.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.990
'I got through as much as I could.'

31:30.040 --> 31:32.030
I need audio summaries

31:32.080 --> 31:34.270
of personnel records
for Ellie Miller.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.390
What she said in her police interview

31:36.440 --> 31:39.230
as well as the DPS reports into her.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.990
~ 'Right, OK.'
~ Did you interview her colleagues?

31:42.040 --> 31:44.030
~ 'Yes.'
~ What did they say?

31:44.080 --> 31:47.190
'I'll get the files. Does this
mean we're going to call her?'

31:47.240 --> 31:50.430
Why don't I have all the photos
of Joe Miller's injuries?

31:50.480 --> 31:52.480
Oh, damn.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.150
'Jocelyn?'

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
(HORN)

32:01.920 --> 32:03.910
'Can you hear me?

32:03.960 --> 32:05.960
Hello? Jocelyn?'

32:28.360 --> 32:30.350
Oh, yeah.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.400
Oh, god.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.270
Say you love me.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.310
(GRUNTS)

32:38.360 --> 32:40.350
(MOANS)

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

32:53.560 --> 32:56.230
Have the garage pick up the
car for me in the morning.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.990
~ We need to take you to hospital.
You might have whiplash.
~ I'm fine.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.030
What happened?

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
I'm fine.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.710
~ Hi.
~ Hey.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.750
He's just gone.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.800
Lucky.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.070
Mine is still snoring.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.320
(CHUCKLES) Here you are.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.360
Feel better?

34:00.640 --> 34:02.910
No, it just sobered me up.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.760
Claire, what happened that night?

34:24.159 --> 34:26.159
I don't know.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.870
Claire.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
Lee drugged me.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.080
He used to have that stuff Rohypnol.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.830
Got a little bottle off
someone and he drugged me

34:40.880 --> 34:43.070
and I woke up halfway
through the night.

34:43.120 --> 34:46.120
~ That isn't what you told the police.
~ No.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.110
I can just feel myself being
pulled back into him,

34:52.159 --> 34:54.150
now that he's back...

34:54.199 --> 34:56.270
Claire, tell me the truth.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.400
Where were you both the night
those girls disappeared?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.750
He drugged me.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.150
I woke up at 5:00am.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.200
He was cleaning.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.640
He was cleaning the whole house.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.230
Your point is, counsel?

35:22.280 --> 35:24.270
Mrs Miller is the defendant's wife

35:24.320 --> 35:26.590
and can't be compelled
to give evidence.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.630
The Crown will not be calling her.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.470
She's also one of the key
investigating officers.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.990
I Think the jury deserve
to hear what she has to say.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.430
Given my lady has excluded
the confession,

35:36.480 --> 35:38.470
how can the jury be expected

35:38.520 --> 35:40.990
to separate Mrs Miller's
evidence as a wife

35:41.040 --> 35:43.510
from that as a police officer?

35:46.200 --> 35:49.030
My rule is to always trust the jury.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.550
They are usually pretty smart.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.030
Rohypnol? Definitely Rohypnol?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.190
Yeah. She woke up
to see him cleaning.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.190
She never said any of that before.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.110
Why are you such a
fuckwit about this?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.150
~ Sorry?
~ She was next door.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.670
She had access. Her
story is inconsistent.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.190
This woman you're
protecting is a suspect.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.230
~ I know.
~ What?

36:11.280 --> 36:14.590
~ You told me you'd been protecting her.
~ I was keeping her safe

36:14.640 --> 36:17.230
~ so she didn't abscond.
~ Why didn't you tell me?

36:17.280 --> 36:19.270
I needed to know if I was going mad.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.150
~ I wanted someone to look at it objectively.
~ For god's sake.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.800
Uh-oh, Miller. This could be you.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.990
You're going to be called.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.630
~ Right, OK, I've done it before.
~ Not like this.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.670
Stay calm, stick to the facts.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.460
Don't get drawn into anything else.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.070
Don't get emotional.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.120
I know.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.750
MAN: Take the book
in your right hand.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.790
And read from the card.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.630
I swear by almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

36:53.680 --> 36:56.950
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.070
Police Constable 516, Ellie Miller,

36:59.120 --> 37:01.710
attached to Exeter Police
Traffic Division,

37:01.760 --> 37:05.160
formerly Detective Sergeant
attached to Broadchurch CID.

37:07.400 --> 37:11.270
How long have you been married
to the defendant, Mrs Miller?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.310
12 years.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.350
You have two children, correct?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.910
Yes, Tom is 13 and huge

37:17.960 --> 37:20.320
and Bertie is nearly two.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.590
Was it a mutual decision
to have children?

37:23.640 --> 37:26.910
I was probably keener but
Joe went along with it.

37:26.960 --> 37:30.870
What sort of relationship did
you have with your husband?

37:30.920 --> 37:32.910
Good.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.350
I went to work and he
looked after the kids.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.400
I loved him.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.710
How would you describe
your relationship

37:42.760 --> 37:44.750
with Mark and Beth Latimer?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.790
We were good friends.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.550
Beth and I were in
the same NCT group.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.140
We had Sunday lunches together.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.460
Our boys, Danny and
Tom were best friends.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.990
How curious was your husband about
how the investigation was proceeding?

38:02.040 --> 38:05.110
Er... on the day Danny's
body was found,

38:05.160 --> 38:07.700
he asked if we knew who did it.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.390
Was he interested in
forensic evidence?

38:10.440 --> 38:12.990
When we found the crime scene

38:13.040 --> 38:15.550
he wanted to know what
we'd discovered.

38:15.600 --> 38:20.390
Had he demonstrated any interest in
forensic evidence prior to this case?

38:20.440 --> 38:22.430
He knew a bit about it

38:22.480 --> 38:24.470
because of his job as a paramedic.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.150
He'd been called to
a few crime scenes.

38:27.200 --> 38:31.440
He knew how evidence was gathered
and what made it easy or difficult.

38:32.920 --> 38:37.510
Have you had any contact with Mr
Miller since the day of his arrest?

38:37.560 --> 38:39.550
No.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.590
Did you at any time

38:41.640 --> 38:45.150
suspect that your husband was involved
in the killing of Danny?

38:45.200 --> 38:47.190
I didn't.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.240
Now, I wish I had.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.590
Why did you attack him, your husband,

38:53.640 --> 38:56.390
in the interview room
after his arrest?

38:56.440 --> 38:59.270
Because the man I trusted
most in the world

38:59.320 --> 39:02.260
had killed the son
of our best friend.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.950
So you attacked him not as a
policewoman attacking a suspect,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.940
but as a wife confronting
her husband?

39:15.600 --> 39:18.590
Yes. The police had nothing to do
with it. It was about him and me.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.630
Thank you, PC Miller.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.230
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.880
It is. It is horrific.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.200
How was your sex life, PC Miller?

39:32.920 --> 39:35.390
I dunno, normal. How would
you describe yours?

39:35.440 --> 39:38.710
Not frequently enough to be honest.
But I'm not in the box.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.800
Quite, Miss Bishop.

39:42.360 --> 39:44.710
Did you engage in S&M?

39:44.760 --> 39:47.590
Bondage? Torture fantasies?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
Violent roleplay?

39:50.480 --> 39:52.470
No, nothing like that.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.710
~ Did your husband use pornography?
~ No.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.070
Apart from one time his
mate gave him a DVD.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.910
We watched it together and
we mostly laughed through it.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.950
~ Did it involve children?
~ No.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.990
Gay pornography?

40:04.040 --> 40:06.030
No.

40:06.080 --> 40:10.030
Did he show a predilection
for images of children?

40:10.080 --> 40:12.070
Not to my knowledge.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.510
Did you either as a wife
or a police officer

40:14.560 --> 40:16.550
ever discover

40:16.600 --> 40:19.670
images of children in your
husband's possession?

40:19.720 --> 40:21.720
No.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.110
Would you say

40:26.160 --> 40:29.160
that you are a good police officer?

40:30.040 --> 40:32.030
I get the job done.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.070
I think you're being modest.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.110
Until recently,

40:36.160 --> 40:38.950
you'd been on a rather strong
career path, hadn't you?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.990
I did my best.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.030
And yet as a police officer,

40:43.080 --> 40:46.670
you didn't detect any suspicious
behaviour from your husband?

40:46.720 --> 40:50.270
~ None.
~ You didn't spot any such behaviours

40:50.320 --> 40:53.310
because your husband didn't
kill Danny, did he?

40:53.360 --> 40:55.350
He did kill Danny.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.950
He's not the person I thought he was.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.630
Are you talking as a wife
or as a police officer now?

41:01.680 --> 41:03.680
Both.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.470
Did you take a sleeping pill

41:07.520 --> 41:09.870
on the night of Danny
Latimer's death?

41:09.920 --> 41:11.910
Yes, I get terrible jet lag.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.950
I have them prescribed.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.390
You didn't wake up until the
next morning, is that correct?

41:17.440 --> 41:21.510
~ That's right.
~ So as far as you were
concerned the next morning

41:21.560 --> 41:23.550
he'd been there all night.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.590
That's what I thought at the time

41:25.640 --> 41:27.710
and it turns out not
to have been true.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.750
Joe knew I'd taken the pills.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.470
He must have planned to
meet Danny accordingly.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.320
Do you actually know of such a plan?

41:36.080 --> 41:40.280
~ No.
~ Then, please stick to the facts, PC Miller.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.430
When did you and DI Hardy

41:46.480 --> 41:48.880
first start having an affair?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.590
What?

41:51.640 --> 41:53.710
Is the affair ongoing?

41:54.800 --> 41:57.510
Can I remind you that
you are on oath.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.230
~ No, we've never had an affair.
~ Again.

42:00.280 --> 42:04.070
Can I remind you, PC Miller,
that you are on oath?

42:04.120 --> 42:06.110
My lady, where is the evidence?

42:06.160 --> 42:08.150
Coming to that now, my lady.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.200
You won't find any
cos it never happened.

42:11.800 --> 42:14.870
The night of your husband's
arrest where were you?

42:14.920 --> 42:17.910
We'd gone to a hotel because
we had to leave our house.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.750
I left my kids with my sister
cos I went to see Beth,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.790
Mrs Latimer.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.830
Why?

42:24.880 --> 42:26.870
I felt I needed to.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.120
And then what did you do?

42:33.520 --> 42:36.520
Where did you go, PC Miller?

42:37.760 --> 42:39.750
I went to see DI Hardy.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.790
Where?

42:41.840 --> 42:44.440
Where did you go to see DI Hardy?

42:45.320 --> 42:47.310
At the Traders Hotel.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.360
In his hotel room?

42:50.200 --> 42:52.270
~ Yes.
~ Were you alone?

42:53.400 --> 42:56.110
~ Yes.
~ How long were you there for?

42:56.160 --> 42:58.150
I don't know.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.750
Well, according to CCTV,

43:00.800 --> 43:05.190
you entered the hotel around 11:37pm.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.750
And left just after a quarter to two.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.150
Over two hours.

43:11.200 --> 43:17.910
What did you and DI Hardy
do alone in his hotel room

43:17.960 --> 43:22.150
for two hours on the
night that he'd arrested

43:22.200 --> 43:25.910
and you'd beaten up the
defendant, your husband?

43:25.960 --> 43:27.950
We talked.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.990
You talked.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.830
You left your two children

43:32.880 --> 43:36.350
on the night that their
father was arrested

43:36.400 --> 43:38.750
for well over two hours

43:38.800 --> 43:43.630
to go and see DI Hardy
in a hotel to talk?

43:43.680 --> 43:46.880
I needed to make sense
of what had happened.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.190
You colluded that night

43:49.240 --> 43:53.190
to frame the defendant, your husband,
to get him out of the way,

43:53.240 --> 43:56.550
because you were having an affair
with DI Hardy, didn't you?

43:56.600 --> 43:58.790
This is how you think
you're gonna win?

43:58.840 --> 44:01.550
By twisting the truth and
distorting our lives?

44:01.600 --> 44:04.110
And isn't it the case
that this investigation

44:04.160 --> 44:08.350
missed key opportunities
and failed to examine leads

44:08.400 --> 44:13.510
because it was compromised by your
personal liaisons with DI Hardy?

44:13.560 --> 44:16.830
And together you put an
innocent man in the dock?

44:16.880 --> 44:19.870
No, totally untrue. You've
got no evidence for this.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.920
I am not the guilty
one here. I am not!

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
Thank you, PC Miller.
