00:02.520 --> 00:04.840
# We're not going out

00:04.840 --> 00:06.720
# Not staying in

00:06.720 --> 00:09.600
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.600 --> 00:11.960
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:11.960 --> 00:15.480
# We're not going out

00:15.480 --> 00:18.560
♪ We are not going out. ♪

00:22.160 --> 00:25.320
Give it to me now!
But I love my lolly!

00:25.320 --> 00:27.760
Why can't we have it?
It's just a lollipop!

00:27.760 --> 00:28.920
Because I said no.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.640
It's not fair!

00:30.640 --> 00:33.160
I wish we had another mummy!

00:33.160 --> 00:35.920
You did have once, but she gave you
up because you were evil.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.960
OK, that was a bit much.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.200
Go on, up to your rooms now,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.120
and make sure you
clean your teeth first.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.880
I'm going to run away from home!

00:43.880 --> 00:46.960
No need to run, I won't be chasing.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.240
I hate this house!

00:48.240 --> 00:51.520
And don't come down
until you've gone through puberty!

00:51.520 --> 00:53.800
Why am I always the bad guy
who punishes them?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.040
I punish them too.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.760
I threaten them with something that
you never could. What's that?

00:57.760 --> 01:00.600
I say I'll send them to you.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.840
What's happened♪ This has happened.
Ooh, lollies.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.240
They've been in the kids' mouths.
So?

01:07.240 --> 01:10.840
That one was in Charlie's mouth.
Ugh.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.400
You know the lollipop man who
works on Shacklegate Drive?

01:13.400 --> 01:17.000
I know the muffin man who
lives down Drury Lane.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.120
You know, the one who's always
outside the school.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.560
Every day he sees the kids,
he gives them a lollipop.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.560
You know, because he's the
Lollipop Man.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.560
That reminds me, I must go
and see that sex education teacher.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.000
Why not, he's a very nice man.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.920
You had to spoil it, didn't you?

01:31.920 --> 01:35.080
Every day he's there,
just giving them out. And?

01:35.080 --> 01:38.720
And, I don't want our kids
turning into hyper-active psychos

01:38.720 --> 01:40.840
and getting distracted
by the tiniest thing.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.400
You do know you've just described
all children, don't you?

01:44.400 --> 01:47.280
Why don't you just tell the kids to
say, "No, thanks, we don't want one,

01:47.280 --> 01:49.000
"but thank you very much for the
offer."

01:49.000 --> 01:51.680
Wow! Do you even know their names?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.520
Well, can't you have a word
with this bloke?

01:55.520 --> 01:56.680
Maybe use a sign.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.280
A big round one with the word -
"stop".

01:58.280 --> 02:00.440
It's the only language these
people understand.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.320
I know I should, but it's tricky.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.720
It can't be that hard.
You haven't met him.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.680
He's the sweetest old man ever.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.600
Big white hair and beard.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.039
He's like a big smiley cauliflower.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.720
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.680
And besides, we're just as bad, we
eat way too much junk in this house.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.280
No, we don't.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.120
Lee, the other day Molly asked
if green M&Ms were a vegetable.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.800
And Benji asked me
how you open an apple.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.120
I've decided that from tomorrow,

02:31.120 --> 02:33.320
we're all going to start eating
more healthily again.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.360
Oh, not beetroot brownies again.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.160
What's wrong with my beetroot
brownies?

02:37.160 --> 02:40.320
Brownies are supposed to be brownie,
not purply.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.680
It's not the only thing that was
supposed to be brownie that
went purply.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.400
We're going to the health
store in the morning,
after we've done the school run.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.880
"We"♪ Yes, "we".

02:49.880 --> 02:54.000
If you think it's so easy to talk
to the Lollipop Man, you can do it.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.440
OK, I will. Good.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.920
I don't think you realise how
difficult it is to say no to

02:58.920 --> 03:01.320
a sweet old man who's just
trying to be friendly.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.640
Do you fancy an early night tonight,
by the way♪ No.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.360
See, it's not that hard.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:15.600 --> 03:18.960
See♪ What did I tell you?
He's lovely.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.120
He looks like God's nicer uncle.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.920
Don't worry, that's the last time
they'll be doing that.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.320
He looks reasonable.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.400
Any man that's campaigning to
"Stop Children" is a kindred spirit.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.080
Morning. Oh, hello.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.440
Beautiful day, isn't it?

03:40.440 --> 03:42.040
Benji, give me your lolly. No!

03:42.040 --> 03:45.240
Give me your lolly. No! No! Oh!

03:45.240 --> 03:46.400
Are you Dad?

03:46.400 --> 03:50.000
No, I don't think I ever met
your mother, but good luck
with the search.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.360
Ha! I bet the kids love having
a fun dad like you.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, it's a
laugh a minute in our house,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.520
followed by 59 seconds of arguing.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.200
Look, there's something
I wanted to say.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.400
You know the lollies...
There is no need for thank-yous.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.280
To be honest, I think
I get more out of it.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.800
The kiddies'
sunny smiles make my day.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.440
And what's a lollipop man
without lollipops, eh?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.720
Actually, there's, um,
something I wanted to ask you.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.160
Yes, son?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.720
Will you adopt me♪ Ha.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.960
No, that's not it.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.960
The kids love the lollies, it's very
generous of you, thank you.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.600
It's a lovely thing you're doing.
Well, thank you.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.680
And don't worry,
I know what you want to say.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.360
I mean, parents come up to me
all the time, it's not a problem.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.960
Really?
Of course you can have a lollipop.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.920
The thing is... Yes?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.680
It's just that some parents,

04:51.680 --> 04:55.400
they might think it's inappropriate,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.880
you know, receiving sweets...

04:59.160 --> 05:01.000
..from strangers.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.080
Oh, dear.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.960
I never really
thought of it like that.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.040
Since my hip operation, I've not
been as active as I used to be,

05:10.040 --> 05:14.200
and giving the little ones a lolly
and seeing their faces light up

05:14.200 --> 05:19.320
is one of the few pleasures that
I have left in life.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.840
I'm so very sorry.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.600
I feel awful.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.920
Well, hang on, let me finish
what I was saying.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.560
Some parents might think that,
but they are idiots,

05:32.560 --> 05:34.800
because we think it's great.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.760
All the parents round here do.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.280
You are the best lollipop man
in the world.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.600
Really♪ Yes.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.880
You've made my day.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.120
You really have.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.640
In fact, as a treat,

05:48.640 --> 05:51.840
your kids are going to get double
helpings from now on.

05:53.080 --> 05:57.120
Oh, good. I'll tell my wife,
she'll be absolutely delighted.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.320
And don't forget to clean
your teeth afterwards.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.400
We don't want them falling out.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.840
Don't worry, my wife will be
knocking them out anyway!

06:05.840 --> 06:08.200
HE LAUGHS
You're a funny man!

06:08.200 --> 06:10.400
Ah, thanks. I hate him.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.520
Fancy some butternut squash cake,
Anna♪ It's gluten-free.

06:22.520 --> 06:26.200
Thanks, Lucy. Nice of you to
remember I'm intolerant.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.920
How could anyone forget?

06:31.400 --> 06:33.560
We're actually on a bit of a health
kick ourselves,

06:33.560 --> 06:38.520
so I used dates instead of sugar,
carob instead of chocolate,

06:38.520 --> 06:40.880
and instead of regular flour,
gluten-free almond flour.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.000
Is there salt in it♪ No.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.280
No, I must be tasting my own tears.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.360
So what are you going to
do about this lollipop man?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.280
Nothing.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.560
Hurting his feelings would be
like slapping a puppy,

06:55.560 --> 07:00.200
or something old and lovely
and respected, like Judi Dench.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.880
We're probably being a bit
unreasonable anyway.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.800
You're not being
unreasonable at all.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.360
Surely this man must be aware
there's a childhood obesity
crisis in this country?

07:08.360 --> 07:12.320
Obviously not, otherwise he'd change
his name to the Courgette Man.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.760
Although he would look a bit odd
stopping the traffic with
a massive courgette.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.280
Would you say something
if it was Jack♪ Of course.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.880
But we don't walk Jack to school.
No.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.000
We drive him the 500 yards
from our house to the school gates

07:26.000 --> 07:29.600
strapped into a top-of-the-range,
hypo-allergenic booster seat,

07:29.600 --> 07:32.840
in the back of a BMW designed
to withstand a land mine blast.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.120
I suppose we just
love our child more.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.000
It's just
so difficult to say anything to him.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.680
He's such a lovely old man.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.680
Well, then, talk to the organ
grinder, not the monkey.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.280
Write an e-mail to the council.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.480
It's a perfectly reasonable
complaint.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.120
I am all about reasonable.
And complaint.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.360
Anna's right. Wow!

07:58.360 --> 08:00.520
I expect many things to come out of
your mouth, Lee,

08:00.520 --> 08:05.520
especially when you're eating,
but not "Anna's right."

08:05.520 --> 08:08.000
We don't have to deal with this,
let the Council do it.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.240
Yeah, but what if he knows it was us
who complained?

08:10.240 --> 08:13.360
The last thing I want to do is sound
like one of those hysterical parents

08:13.360 --> 08:16.600
who can't appreciate a nice gesture
and are forever criticising people.

08:17.520 --> 08:21.560
I can feel you trying not to
look at me, Toby.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.720
No, I, I was just
staring into the abyss.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.920
As usual.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.560
He won't know it's you who's
complained.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.559
Especially
if you don't put your names on it.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.360
Are you sure this hasn't
got salt in?

08:36.360 --> 08:38.200
I imagine there's natural
salt in the kelp.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.039
Well spotted, Anna. What's kelp?
It's a kind of seaweed. Oh.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.360
I thought it was an abbreviation
for "cry for help".

08:51.800 --> 08:54.320
I hate doing this,
can't you write it?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.880
No, you're better at things
like this, you'll word it right.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.480
"Dear Sir..." That's wrong.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.640
Put "Dear Sir/Madam." I have.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.920
Did you put a slash?
No, Lee, I put an emoji of a turnip.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.040
"Dear Sir - slash - Madam, I..."

09:09.040 --> 09:12.640
Put "we". It's got more gravitas if
it sounds like it's coming from more
than one person.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.480
Do you actually know what
"gravitas" means?

09:14.480 --> 09:17.480
Yeah, it's where gravy was invented.
Just write it.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.720
"We are writing
because we are curious..."

09:20.720 --> 09:24.360
Don't put "curious". I know we don't
want to get him into trouble, but
it's got to sound a bit

09:24.360 --> 09:26.240
like a complaint.
Put "by curious..."

09:26.240 --> 09:28.480
You want me to say I'm bi-curious?

09:29.760 --> 09:32.240
Sorry, "we" are bi-curious.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.760
"By curious, we mean unhappy."

09:34.760 --> 09:36.760
No, I'm not saying "unhappy",
it's too harsh.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.960
I was going to put,

09:37.960 --> 09:40.720
"We are curious as to whether
our lovely lollipop man is

09:40.720 --> 09:44.160
"breaking any rules by generously
giving out lollipops to the kids."

09:44.160 --> 09:47.480
Do you want him
to stop or get an OBE?

09:47.480 --> 09:50.200
You've got to be a bit more
assertive, Lucy. Fine.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.880
"Dear Sir - slash - Madam, and the
bi-curious, we are unhappy..."

09:53.880 --> 09:56.040
Actually, put "very unhappy".
I will punch you!

09:56.040 --> 09:58.880
No, that's a bit too harsh,
don't put that.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.080
What if I put "unhappy"
but also "understanding"?

10:02.080 --> 10:04.240
Yeah, brilliant. What about this?

10:04.240 --> 10:06.720
"Dear Madam/Sir/Madam
and Bi-Curious Madam,

10:06.720 --> 10:09.960
"we are frickin' livid that one
of your lollipop numpties is dealing

10:09.960 --> 10:12.760
"out the sugar equivalent of crack
cocaine. And when we say 'livid',

10:12.760 --> 10:15.920
"we do of course mean
'completely fine about it'."

10:15.920 --> 10:19.000
Do you know what,
why don't you write it?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.400
All right, I will.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.440
"Dear Sir..." Slash Madam. I know!

10:28.480 --> 10:31.840
Mum♪ Why doesn't this cereal
make any noise?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.680
I like the sort that goes
snap, crackle and pop.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.160
Muesli doesn't snap,
crackle or pop, son.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.280
It just sighs gently to itself
whilst wishing it was Sugar Puffs.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.400
I got an e-mail
back from the council.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.640
What did they say?

10:45.640 --> 10:48.360
They said they were grateful for us
alerting them to the situation

10:48.360 --> 10:50.120
and that they would be
dealing with it.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.280
Grrrrrreat!

10:53.400 --> 10:55.680
Sorry, I think
I'm missing me Frosties.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.000
Right, shoes.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.200
What if he knows it was us?
He won't. He might.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.400
I'm terrible at hiding my guilt.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.040
That's not true. When we're rowing,
you act like you haven't done
anything wrong,

11:08.040 --> 11:11.600
like you don't even know how to
delete the semifinal of the
World Darts Masters

11:11.600 --> 11:15.680
to free up space
to record One Born Every Minute.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.240
Look, we did the right thing.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.720
He'll never know it was us.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.640
So you've got nothing to
worry about.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.320
Can you take them to school today?
No chance.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.160
See♪ You can't face him either.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.360
Of course I can't.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.760
What if he looks all sad
and depressed and lonely?

11:33.760 --> 11:36.760
Be like looking at the only one left
alive in Last of the Summer Wine.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.760
One man, alone in a bath,
no-one to push him down the hill.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.920
Right, we're both going.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.440
I've not had any breakfast.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.920
Well, you can have one of my
cucumber and date muffins. Ugh.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.680
Just close your eyes
and think of Mr Kipling.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.360
That's what I do
when we're having sex.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.400
Now, if there are no lollipops,

12:03.400 --> 12:06.120
I don't want to hear any complaints,
OK♪ OK.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.840
I was talking to the kids.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.680
And if he says anything about being
told off by the council,
just act ignorant.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.560
In fact, just act normal.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.800
Where's the lollipop man?
Didn't you hear?

12:17.800 --> 12:20.880
What♪ Some busybody complained to
the council about old Fred

12:20.880 --> 12:23.080
- giving out lollies to the kids.
- Nooo!

12:24.560 --> 12:27.800
He's been suspended, apparently,
a week without pay.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.520
Why do these parents have to
interfere?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.480
Well, let's not make too many
assumptions.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.040
Sometimes it's just one parent
and the dad was talked into it.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.720
What exactly did you write
in that e-mail?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.960
Nothing major.

12:42.960 --> 12:47.400
I just said, "What if one
of our kids was glucose-intolerant?"

12:47.400 --> 12:50.960
All right, I said one of our kids
was glucose-intolerant.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.760
Anything else?

12:52.760 --> 12:55.600
I might have mentioned the word
"coma".

12:56.960 --> 12:59.960
I know it's terrible,
but if it's against council rules.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.800
I know, but what harm was he doing?

13:02.800 --> 13:05.480
20 years he's been doing that job.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.080
Well, he was due a week off.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.640
Plus, now it's really tricky
crossing the road.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.640
Oh, well,
he'll only be gone for a week.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.800
Yeah, I'm sure there won't be that
many kids knocked over before then.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.800
Oh, for God's sake!
All this over a stupid little lolly.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.880
I know.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.880
It wasn't even a proper Chupa Chup.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.720
What are these people like?

13:24.720 --> 13:28.120
Just because a man wants to give out
a few lollipops, somebody has

13:28.120 --> 13:31.560
to fire off a bloody e-mail, or
write a letter or make a phone call.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.360
Who knows how they made contact.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.520
So what do you
think of the beetroot cake, Dad?

13:49.960 --> 13:52.520
Go on, you can say,
you won't hurt my feelings.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.720
I've eaten smoother cat litter.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.360
That'll be the gluten-free
almond flour.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.040
Good Lord, Lucy, there's nothing
wrong with a bit of gluten.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.560
Yes, if flour is so bad for you,

14:04.560 --> 14:07.040
how come the Homepride Men
are still going?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.960
You can't eat anything nowadays.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.640
Apparently even sugar is poison.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.200
Never did me any harm.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.920
Dad, you've got
so many metal fillings,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.360
the kids think you're part robot.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.840
That certainly explains
the personality.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.640
Drink, Geoffrey♪ Yes.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.520
Water. Lots.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.720
And some rehydration salts.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.680
Actually, I do agree with your dad
about this whole sugar issue.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.440
In fact,
you're not going to believe this,

14:31.440 --> 14:35.080
apparently a local lollipop man
has just been suspended

14:35.080 --> 14:38.360
because some parents reported him
for giving out lollipops.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.360
What interfering, stupid killjoys.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.720
Get out of here! It's typical,
isn't it?

14:44.720 --> 14:47.480
Bloody political correctness
gone mad.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.560
It's a nanny state,
health and safety.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.840
You can't do anything nowadays with
these bleeding-heart liberals.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.520
One more, Dad, and we've got a full
house in the Daily Mail bingo.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.640
Poor bloke was probably just trying
to bring a bit of joy to the

15:00.640 --> 15:04.120
kiddies, and now it's all been
ruined by some mollycoddling parents

15:04.120 --> 15:08.040
who want to wrap their children
in bubble wrap and cotton wool.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.560
Actually,
that sounds quite dangerous.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.120
Look, I know what you're saying,
Dad,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.600
but when it comes to kids' health,
you can't be too careful.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.240
Course you can.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.720
When you were young we didn't have
any of this clap-trap.

15:18.720 --> 15:22.280
You were quite happy playing all
day in the sun with no sunscreen,

15:22.280 --> 15:26.080
swinging on home-made rope swings
over stagnant ponds.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.240
Stroking strange dogs.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.240
Eating mushrooms
you'd found in the woods.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.400
Throwing Frisbees at power stations.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.320
And if you were playing up,
some other child's parent would

15:39.320 --> 15:43.040
slap you hard on the legs,
and we'd thank them for doing it.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.840
I thought my upbringing was bad.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.880
Yours sounds like the opening
scenes in Casualty.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.840
So you think the parents
who complained about the lollies
were over-reacting, then, Mum?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.360
Well, yes, of course they were.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.240
Poor old man.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.520
He's probably sat at home now
wondering what he's done wrong.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.320
Alone.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.080
All dignified, yet vulnerable.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.560
His hat and lollipop stick propped
up in the corner. All right!

16:09.560 --> 16:12.640
I'm sure the parents only had
their children's welfare at heart.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.760
Well, kids are
far too sheltered nowadays.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.120
Things used to be a lot different.
Here we go.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.840
There used to be only one
winner in pass-the-parcel.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.440
Children didn't have iPads
or au pairs to amuse them.

16:26.440 --> 16:31.120
They sat quietly in a pub car park,
sharing one Panda Pop between them.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.520
Then Dad would drive home drunk,

16:34.520 --> 16:38.120
and let the tallest child
sit on his lap and steer.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.480
What are you doing?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.960
Just seeing if there's an upper age
limit for calling ChildLine.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.520
What's that?

16:52.520 --> 16:53.640
Aubergine cake.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.760
If I'd have known that,
I'd have slapped my own hand.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.400
It's not for you, it's for Fred,
the Lollipop Man.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.520
One of the mums said he's
been in the park,

17:02.520 --> 17:06.839
just sat there feeding pigeons every
day since we got him suspended.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.760
Would you stop saying
"we" got him suspended.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.160
He got himself suspended,

17:10.160 --> 17:14.040
dishing out sweets like some
sort of hi-vis Willy Wonka.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.040
Well, I thought we could take him
something nice
and check he's all right.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.560
Do you think that's such
a good idea?

17:18.560 --> 17:21.200
Well, it's better than just sitting
here wracked with guilt.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.760
I'm doing denial,
that's working for me.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.280
And who knows, one of my cakes might
cheer him up. Maybe.

17:29.160 --> 17:33.360
Actually, have
we not done enough to him already?

17:33.360 --> 17:35.200
It just needs a bit more wheatgrass.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.640
I'll go and empty the lawnmower bag.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.800
Hello, Fred.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.920
Oh, hello.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.080
I hope your lovely children
are getting to school OK...

17:55.080 --> 17:57.040
..since I went Awol.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.520
I'd hardly say Awol. Yeah.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.320
You didn't desert your post, Fred,
you were court-martialled.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.600
But unfairly.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.320
So it's not you that should be
arrested for desertion, it's the...

18:08.320 --> 18:11.280
..stupid parents,
who reported you, that should be

18:11.280 --> 18:15.760
rounded up, blindfolded
and shot in the head at dawn.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.840
I used to be in the armed services,
actually.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.280
I saw action, in Korea.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.160
We lost a lot of very good men
during that war,

18:28.160 --> 18:30.560
like Sergeant Gregory.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.720
He took me under his wing, he did.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.040
Saw that I was homesick
and frightened.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.400
Well, of course I was,
I was only a boy.

18:39.400 --> 18:46.000
And every time he saw me looking
worried, do you know what he'd do?

18:46.000 --> 18:51.560
He'd reach into his tunic
and bring out a small tin of sweets,

18:51.560 --> 18:54.240
and he'd give me one.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.720
Just like my mum used to do
when I was a little boy.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.760
And every time he did, just for a
minute,

19:02.760 --> 19:06.240
I felt that I was back
at home being cuddled by my mum,

19:06.240 --> 19:09.760
and everything was going to be OK.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.480
Then, one day, we was ambushed

19:13.480 --> 19:16.000
and he gave the...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
..the ultimate sacrifice.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.600
And as he lay there dying,

19:22.600 --> 19:26.440
do you know what
the last thing he did?

19:26.440 --> 19:28.960
He saw how frightened I was,

19:28.960 --> 19:32.360
so he reached into his pocket...

19:34.320 --> 19:38.040
..and gave me a final sweet.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.160
From that day on,

19:41.160 --> 19:45.160
I vowed that I would try to put

19:45.160 --> 19:49.280
a smile on youngsters' faces,
like he did to me.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.240
Just a small offering of a
lollipop...

19:55.240 --> 19:57.280
..but enough...

19:57.280 --> 20:00.560
..to show the young-uns that I care.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.000
Is he actually taking the piss?

20:10.560 --> 20:14.760
Well, we think you're
an excellent lollipop man.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.640
In fact, we've brought you something
to thank you for all your hard work.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.600
It's a nice aubergine cake.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.920
It's very healthy, just flour, eggs,
chopped dates, wheatgrass

20:24.920 --> 20:26.640
and aubergine.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.320
I know, Fred, I agree. What I would
give to hear an E-number.

20:30.320 --> 20:34.000
It's lovely and pure
and full of goodness.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.080
Just like you.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.360
Now you just sound creepy.

20:37.360 --> 20:42.120
You're very kind,
but there's no need.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.480
I couldn't take that.
Of course you can.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.120
Just hold your nose
when you're swallowing.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.800
Perhaps you could share it
with your grandkids.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.120
You do have grandkids, don't you?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.320
Oh, yes. Good.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.200
But I never get to see them
since they emigrated to Canada.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.760
Never mind. Can't complain.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.560
Well, what about sharing it
with your wife?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.520
Here it comes.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.320
She died last year. Course she did.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.520
Oh, please take the cake, Fred.
It'll make us feel better.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.640
I mean happy.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.200
There's really no need.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.040
Take the cake, there's a good
fella. Don't make me tell you about
the time my Uncle Pete was

21:21.040 --> 21:24.960
fighting in Saigon and wrote
down the recipe in his own blood.

21:24.960 --> 21:29.680
That's very kind of you both.
It's made me very happy.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.760
You're welcome, Fred,
we'll see you next Monday.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.640
That's when you're due back
at work, right?

21:33.640 --> 21:36.960
No more lollipops, I'm afraid.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.120
Just high-five
for the kiddies from now on.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.720
You know, Fred,
a few months after my granny died,

21:43.720 --> 21:45.240
my grandad got a dog.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.160
They're great company, you know?

21:47.160 --> 21:50.000
I used to have a dog, actually.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.840
Until recently.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.360
There was this lorry reversing...
We're going.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.320
What's this?
It's my home-made cereal.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.760
I don't like these glass jars.
Why not?

22:05.760 --> 22:08.600
Because then we have to see
what's in them.

22:08.600 --> 22:13.400
Oh, it's Monday today, which
means old Fred will be back on
lollipop duty.

22:13.400 --> 22:18.080
Yeah, unless he's lost a leg
since we last saw him,
or his budgie's developed rickets.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.600
But that'll be good that we
get to see him again, won't it kids?

22:20.600 --> 22:23.120
No. He won't have any lollipops.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.560
Benji, there's more to life than
sweets, you know?

22:25.560 --> 22:28.600
That man is a war hero
who offers you a big smile

22:28.600 --> 22:31.000
when he sees you, and keeps you safe
when you cross the road.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.440
What could be better than that?
Lollipops.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.640
Where's Fred?
He was due back today, wasn't he?

22:45.640 --> 22:47.920
Didn't you hear♪ He's in hospital.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.240
Food poisoning.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.480
He's had a terrible allergic
reaction to nuts.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.600
Apparently one of the parents
gave him a cake.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.080
Imagine! In this day and age,
giving someone a cake with nuts in

22:59.080 --> 23:01.000
and not putting a warning
label on it.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.480
What idiot does that?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.880
What exactly did you
put in that cake?

23:07.880 --> 23:09.960
Well, I didn't put any nuts in it.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.720
I told him the ingredients.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.080
Aubergine, dates, eggs and flour.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.480
Gluten-free almond flour.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.120
Almond is a nut. Is it?

23:22.120 --> 23:26.200
Well, some people say it's actually
an insect, but I'm not convinced.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.760
Is Fred OK?

23:31.760 --> 23:33.360
Well, they don't know yet.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.920
They found him in the park,
trousers round his ankles

23:35.920 --> 23:37.800
and vomiting into a fountain.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.960
Well, we've all been there.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.960
Poor man. He wouldn't have been sat
in the park eating cake
in the first place

23:43.960 --> 23:45.920
if those busybodies
hadn't reported him.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.320
Well, I'm sure whoever wrote the
e-mail about the lollies

23:48.320 --> 23:52.040
probably thought they were doing
the right thing. Well, they
shouldn't have interfered.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.000
He was just trying to spread
a little happiness.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.400
Yeah, but the parents were probably
worried about their kids
having too much sugar.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.840
That's fair enough, right♪ Yeah,
but why should Fred suffer

23:59.840 --> 24:02.000
because some parents can't control
their children?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.760
He didn't deserve to be suspended.
You know he's just lost his wife.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.640
And his family have just moved
abroad too.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.320
He must be so lonely.
And his dog died.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.720
He was just doing his job.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.800
And now we've got nobody to help us
cross the road.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.200
I don't know how these people
sleep at night.
It's awful, really awful.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.760
War hero, apparently. Awful!

24:17.760 --> 24:20.120
And did you hear about his poor
sister?

24:20.120 --> 24:23.080
All right! Enough! Don't you think
you're all being a bit dramatic?

24:23.080 --> 24:25.920
All right, yes, the parents probably
should have just said something

24:25.920 --> 24:29.920
if they weren't happy about the
lollipops. And, no, perhaps
they shouldn't have reported him.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.280
But, they did what they thought was
right for their kids.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.400
Is that so wrong?

24:33.400 --> 24:36.320
And OK, now it's a bit more
difficult to cross the road,

24:36.320 --> 24:39.360
but maybe, in this world of health
and safety gone mad,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.720
we can all learn to cross
the road without help.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.760
It's not that difficult. We all
remember the Green Cross Code,
don't we?

24:44.760 --> 24:47.160
Look right, look left,
and look right again.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.800
I've brought you a nice cup of tea.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.560
And a Mars bar.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.960
Oh, no, are we out of quinoa
and toadstool flapjacks?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.800
I thought you deserved a treat.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.480
How's the leg?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.640
It's fine.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.040
But the doctor says I'll never
Riverdance again.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.160
I suppose it's ironic,
given the week we've had. What is?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.480
Being hit by a
Holland and Barrett van.

25:24.480 --> 25:28.600
At least you saw Fred
when you were in the hospital. Yeah.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.960
It's nice knowing he'll be out next
week and back to work.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.920
And even better knowing he still
doesn't suspect it was us that
reported him in the first place.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.080
And he definitely forgave us
for poisoning him♪ Course he did.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.560
You know Fred,
he just smiled warmly,

25:40.560 --> 25:43.840
apologised for worrying us
and gave me a bag of cola cubes.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.240
What a twat.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.880
I might go and see him tomorrow.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.520
Yeah, well don't take him a cake.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.880
Maybe something
unhealthy like a Mars bar.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.280
Yeah, or a Snickers.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.440
No!

25:57.440 --> 25:59.960
Well, I think
we've both learned something anyway.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.080
What's that?

26:01.080 --> 26:03.520
We should have just said something
to him in the first place.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.160
I mean, as long as you're completely
straight with someone
in a truthful but firm manner,

26:07.160 --> 26:08.880
they can't really take offence,
can they?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.560
I'm glad you said that, because
there's something I wanted to say.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.440
Can we stop all this
healthy eating stuff?

26:13.440 --> 26:17.360
The food you've been making this
week has been absolutely minging.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.640
Aaargh!

26:24.200 --> 26:26.240
# We're not going out

26:26.240 --> 26:27.840
# Not staying in

26:27.840 --> 26:31.160
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

26:31.160 --> 26:33.840
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

26:33.840 --> 26:37.160
# We're not going out
