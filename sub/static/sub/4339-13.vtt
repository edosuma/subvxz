WEBVTT

00:03.449 --> 00:06.450
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
- I have something --

00:06.452 --> 00:09.219
something people would pay
a lot of money for.

00:09.221 --> 00:11.554
- The<i> Lumen.</i> I think
we can do business.

00:11.556 --> 00:14.523
- The<i> Lumen</i> will be auctioned off tomorrow.
We need to prepare.

00:14.525 --> 00:18.159
- I will be attending the auction.
- Not with my resources!

00:18.161 --> 00:21.228
- If you do not provide the funds
for the<i> Lumen,</i> you will never

00:21.230 --> 00:23.797
get another drop of the white.
- He's playing you.

00:23.799 --> 00:26.499
- Of course. There is much
more to come.

00:26.501 --> 00:30.336
- Tomorrow the<i> Lumen</i> goes on
sale to the highest bidder.

00:30.338 --> 00:33.472
I need the Ancients to back me.
- The gold will not be an issue.

00:33.474 --> 00:36.975
- I will obtain the book.
After I've examined it,

00:36.977 --> 00:39.377
I'll turn it over.
- Agreed.

00:39.379 --> 00:42.179
Mr. Elizalde. Your mission
was a success?

00:42.181 --> 00:44.981
- Got you 20 hungry wolves.
- Good. Because your friend

00:44.983 --> 00:47.516
the pawnbroker is about to
obtain a valuable book

00:47.518 --> 00:50.719
on behalf of the Ancients.
Your job is to convince him

00:50.721 --> 00:53.922
to give up the book.
- What if he doesn't get convinced?

00:53.924 --> 00:56.424
- Kill him and take it.
- Kelly's parents

00:56.426 --> 00:58.893
contacted the centre yesterday.
- Nana and Grandpa?

00:58.895 --> 01:00.761
- From where?
- Sea Island, Georgia.

01:00.763 --> 01:03.230
- Dad, we should go there.
We'll be safe.

01:03.232 --> 01:05.532
- It's done. We got
the travel permits.

01:05.534 --> 01:08.701
- You had no other options
for Zack. Now you do.

01:08.703 --> 01:12.271
- I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry
for hurting you.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.140
I still love you.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.614
(metal screeching)

01:29.388 --> 01:32.188
- Good work, Mr. Ortega.

01:32.190 --> 01:35.958
I am impressed by your progress.
- Well, it's been

01:35.960 --> 01:40.028
hard getting guys out here, given
all the shit that's been going on.

01:40.030 --> 01:42.697
- That's why we are paying
triple wages.

01:42.699 --> 01:45.099
- Yeah, that went a long way.

01:46.535 --> 01:48.535
You know, this is one of the
most complicated systems

01:48.537 --> 01:51.571
I've ever worked on. Is it some
sort of European model?

01:51.573 --> 01:55.374
- It's origins
are European, yes.

01:58.045 --> 02:01.212
The enclosures open only
from the top, yes?

02:01.214 --> 02:02.650
Just as you specified.

02:02.676 --> 02:05.915
And the incinerator?
- It's being prefabbed.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.484
Should be installed by the end
of the week.

02:08.486 --> 02:10.486
- Very good.
- Seems like

02:10.488 --> 02:14.422
a strange time and a strange place to be
constructing an animal-processing plant.

02:14.424 --> 02:16.157
- Your point being?

02:16.159 --> 02:20.527
- What kind of animal are you
gonna be processing here?

02:22.464 --> 02:25.965
- Sheep.
- Ah.

02:41.448 --> 02:43.981
(theme music)

03:00.632 --> 03:04.166
(lively blues music)

03:17.614 --> 03:20.014
(camera shutter sound)

03:21.650 --> 03:24.384
- Don't tell me you're actually
going to miss this place?

03:24.386 --> 03:27.019
- A little.

03:30.990 --> 03:34.624
Mr. Setrakian, I'm leaving.

03:34.626 --> 03:36.626
- Very well.

03:36.628 --> 03:39.028
Travel safe.

03:44.502 --> 03:48.070
- Give me your phone. C'mon,
get in there. Nora, c'mon.

03:51.208 --> 03:54.709
Alright. Everybody smile.

03:56.646 --> 03:58.745
Everybody smile.

04:01.416 --> 04:04.183
OK, that's... that's great.
(camera shutter sound)

04:04.185 --> 04:06.151
Not big on good-byes, huh?

04:06.153 --> 04:10.221
- Not when you've said
as many as I have.

04:10.223 --> 04:14.725
- Well, good luck getting your
book, Professor.

04:20.665 --> 04:25.200
- Good luck to you too, Doctor.

04:25.202 --> 04:28.569
- Take care of yourself.
Get some sleep.

04:30.072 --> 04:32.205
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

04:32.207 --> 04:35.674
We're kissing now?
(kissing sounds)

04:35.676 --> 04:37.709
C'mere, Zack.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.112
Take care of yourself,
big guy. Yeah?

04:41.114 --> 04:45.248
You, uh, send me a postcard.
- Yeah, right.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.617
- Well, it'll show up
in a couple a years.

04:50.687 --> 04:53.854
I thought this was a quick trip
down the coast and back.

04:53.856 --> 04:55.589
- With a couple of stops in DC.

04:55.591 --> 04:57.524
We've got some friends and
contacts there.

04:57.526 --> 05:00.026
- To put your bio-bomb together?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

05:00.028 --> 05:02.862
- Well...

05:02.864 --> 05:06.198
don't know where
we'll be, but uh...

05:06.200 --> 05:08.433
when you get back,

05:08.435 --> 05:11.102
well, make sure--
- We'll find you.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.273
Let's go.

05:51.108 --> 05:54.242
- You need to make them
respect you, Eldritch.

05:54.244 --> 05:57.011
They can't succeed without you.

05:57.013 --> 06:00.747
- They seem very certain
that they can.

06:00.749 --> 06:03.649
- Remind them that they can't.

06:05.753 --> 06:08.253
You don't need to die.

06:08.255 --> 06:12.857
And we never have to lose
what we have... ever.

06:12.859 --> 06:15.659
- Ever.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.333
Ever.

06:26.936 --> 06:29.536
(car honking)
- So, uh,

06:29.538 --> 06:31.971
how much gold are we talking
about here?

06:31.973 --> 06:34.173
- Gold?

06:34.175 --> 06:36.642
- Yeah, gold.

06:36.644 --> 06:39.711
You know, the thing that we're
using to bargain for the<i> Lumen?</i>

06:39.713 --> 06:43.547
How much do the Ancients have?
- I have no idea.

06:43.549 --> 06:46.516
- No idea.

06:46.518 --> 06:48.618
Doesn't that kind of
make it hard to bid?

06:48.620 --> 06:52.021
- One way or another, we will
get the<i> Lumen.</i>

06:52.023 --> 06:54.123
- One way or another?

06:54.125 --> 06:56.692
- We win it, we take it,

06:56.694 --> 06:59.027
or we die trying.

06:59.029 --> 07:02.397
- Yeah, alright.

07:02.399 --> 07:05.700
How 'bout we skip that third
option, though, huh?

07:09.805 --> 07:12.405
(crowd shouting)

07:12.407 --> 07:15.875
- (man): Keep going. Next!

07:19.714 --> 07:22.981
You folks are lucky.
You're on the last train out.

07:22.983 --> 07:25.316
- The last train?
- National Guard's

07:25.318 --> 07:29.887
gathering up all the trains.
Go. Next!

07:35.327 --> 07:37.427
(gunshots)
(screaming)

07:37.429 --> 07:41.029
- Come on. Let's go!
- Let's go, be quick. Move it.

07:41.031 --> 07:42.997
- Two bag limit!

07:42.999 --> 07:46.400
No one is allowed on this train
with more than two bags!

07:46.402 --> 07:49.669
- How long until the train
arrives?

07:49.671 --> 07:52.238
- Your guess is as good as mine.
-<i> Attention all passengers.</i>

07:52.240 --> 07:54.673
<i>We appreciate your patience.</i>
<i> The train departing</i>

07:54.675 --> 07:57.842
<i>for Washington DC, Charleston,</i>
<i> Savannah, Jacksonville,</i>

07:57.844 --> 08:01.846
<i>Orlando and terminating in Tampa/Miami
should be arriving shortly.</i>

08:01.848 --> 08:05.382
- The right thing to do
is usually the hardest.

08:05.384 --> 08:08.451
- Well, this is going
to be very tough.

08:11.355 --> 08:13.722
You know, when we get to DC...

08:13.724 --> 08:18.292
we get a fresh shot at putting
that bioweapon together again.

08:20.129 --> 08:23.063
Maybe, uh...

08:23.065 --> 08:26.699
- Let's focus
on getting there, OK?

08:26.701 --> 08:29.868
- I know I don't have
a right to ask you that--

08:29.870 --> 08:32.270
- No, you don't.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.775
- Well, at least I know that
nobody can annoy you

08:39.777 --> 08:42.444
as much as I do.

09:11.775 --> 09:13.975
(grunt)

09:16.746 --> 09:18.912
(growling)

09:21.016 --> 09:23.683
(snarling)

09:32.092 --> 09:35.993
(men speaking in Spanish)

09:38.964 --> 09:40.697
- This here is Quinlan.

09:40.699 --> 09:43.633
He's the one responsible for
getting you guys out of jail.

09:43.635 --> 09:45.901
Pay attention.

09:54.610 --> 09:56.610
(muttering)

09:56.612 --> 09:59.946
- This freak?

09:59.948 --> 10:04.550
He's one of them, man!
- I am not one of them.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.987
- I'll tell you what you are...

10:08.989 --> 10:11.389
you're dead!

10:11.391 --> 10:13.858
(crunch)
(outcries)

10:17.997 --> 10:20.963
- Anyone else?

10:23.500 --> 10:26.634
Gentlemen. Human life

10:26.636 --> 10:28.902
is fleeting.

10:30.572 --> 10:32.905
I've watched many men perish,

10:32.907 --> 10:34.706
good and bad.

10:34.708 --> 10:38.142
The act itself, the dying,
is the same.

10:38.144 --> 10:41.145
- What distinguishes the
honourable

10:41.147 --> 10:45.382
from the dishonourable is how in the
few, most important moments in life,

10:45.384 --> 10:47.751
they conducted themselves.

10:47.753 --> 10:51.321
How would you men like
to be remembered?

10:51.323 --> 10:54.324
As human animals, marginalized,

10:54.326 --> 10:58.494
locked away in cages?
Or as warriors?

10:58.496 --> 11:01.563
Fighters of the highest order?

11:03.166 --> 11:06.900
Today, you fight for one tribe:

11:06.902 --> 11:09.435
humankind.

11:09.437 --> 11:12.438
It no longer matters
what colour you wear,

11:12.440 --> 11:15.574
or what colour your skin is.
All that matters

11:17.377 --> 11:19.377
is the colour of your blood.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.180
Red versus white.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.517
Today you will define
who you are.

11:29.187 --> 11:32.887
Today you will spill white blood

11:32.889 --> 11:36.357
and change the future.

11:36.359 --> 11:38.792
Are you with me?
(cheering)

11:40.762 --> 11:42.962
Then let us fight.

11:44.465 --> 11:47.098
(train bell clanging)
(indistinct PA voice)

11:49.268 --> 11:51.668
(brakes screeching)

11:57.775 --> 12:00.709
(hubbub)

12:00.711 --> 12:03.445
- Everybody needs
to find a seat!

12:03.447 --> 12:06.281
Keep your luggage out
of the aisles!

12:06.283 --> 12:09.450
The train is full,

12:09.452 --> 12:11.885
but every ticketed
passenger has a seat,

12:11.887 --> 12:14.420
so please be courteous.

12:14.422 --> 12:17.723
We hope to depart
within the hour.

12:29.102 --> 12:32.403
- Welcome, Professor. I'm glad
to see you made it.

12:32.405 --> 12:35.472
It's gonna be a good time.
But first I'm gonna ask

12:35.474 --> 12:37.640
you and your friend here to
check all your weapons.

12:37.642 --> 12:40.576
You'll get it back at the end.

12:40.578 --> 12:43.745
Now, how about a drink?

12:43.747 --> 12:45.513
- No, thank you.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.915
- Alright, I'll have one
for you.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.786
We're gonna need you
to verify and register

12:54.788 --> 12:57.821
your gold funds with James
right over here.

12:59.457 --> 13:02.357
OK, good luck, Professor.

13:02.359 --> 13:04.892
- Thanks.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.997
- Who's this guy?

13:15.436 --> 13:18.170
- We are going to need to see
your weapons.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.438
- I have no weapons.
- Up.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.274
- Who are you?
- I am Thomas Eichorst.

13:24.276 --> 13:26.042
Mr. Palmer's emissary.

13:26.044 --> 13:29.678
I will be bidding in his place.
- You got gold,

13:29.680 --> 13:33.881
you can bid. Just register your
funds right over there.

13:33.883 --> 13:36.617
- Of course.
- I'll go get the book,

13:36.619 --> 13:39.052
so we can get this show
on the road.

13:39.054 --> 13:42.722
- Here is my account information,
which all will be verified.

13:42.724 --> 13:46.125
- Where is Palmer?
- This transaction is much

13:46.127 --> 13:48.794
too important.

13:48.796 --> 13:52.230
I will have the honour of
acquiring the<i> Lumen.</i>

13:57.470 --> 14:01.205
Abraham, how ironic that

14:01.207 --> 14:03.040
our duel should end
not with a fight

14:03.042 --> 14:05.642
but with a simple
transaction in gold.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.810
- I assure you, Eichorst,

14:07.812 --> 14:11.313
our duel shall end with
a transaction in silver.

14:11.315 --> 14:15.483
So, the Master passed you over

14:15.485 --> 14:18.819
for Bolivar.
A third-rate musical act.

14:18.821 --> 14:21.888
Does it hurt at all to
be bound by loyalty

14:21.890 --> 14:25.992
to one so obviously
unimpressed by you?

14:31.331 --> 14:33.698
- Does it not pain you

14:33.700 --> 14:38.002
to tally all the things that
I have taken from you already?

14:41.674 --> 14:44.374
- You're a creature
of filth, Eichorst.

14:44.376 --> 14:47.443
- Were it up to me,

14:47.445 --> 14:51.746
I would suck you dry
and snap your neck,

14:51.748 --> 14:53.848
denying you one final time.

14:53.850 --> 14:57.851
But do you know that the Master
has a plan for you?

14:57.853 --> 14:59.619
Yes.

14:59.621 --> 15:01.554
He wants you to turn,

15:01.556 --> 15:04.423
to bear witness to that which
you have been fighting

15:04.425 --> 15:06.925
against for so long.
- Never!

15:06.927 --> 15:09.060
I will release you,
Eichorst, to die

15:09.062 --> 15:11.662
like the soulless
appendage you are.

15:13.298 --> 15:16.565
- I'm pretty sure he's right.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.367
- Easy -- hey. Why don't
you all step back?

15:19.369 --> 15:23.771
- It's too bad that all these
gangsters are watching us, huh?

15:23.773 --> 15:25.906
'Cause I'm dying for a chance

15:25.908 --> 15:29.376
to stick a piece of rebar in
your right ear

15:29.378 --> 15:31.544
and watch it come out your left.

15:31.546 --> 15:35.047
- Both credit lines verified.

15:35.049 --> 15:37.281
- (Creem): Here we go.

15:39.652 --> 15:41.952
Both your banks
in Switzerland have agreed

15:41.954 --> 15:45.255
to convert funds into gold based
upon the current exchange rate.

15:45.257 --> 15:47.156
Highest dollar value bid wins.

15:47.158 --> 15:50.492
Now, let me see. What number
should I start at?

15:50.494 --> 15:54.762
- $5 million.
- Alright, 5 million it is.

15:54.764 --> 15:57.631
- 10 million.
- 15.

16:00.235 --> 16:02.068
- Do I hear 20?
- 30 million.

16:02.070 --> 16:06.172
- 50.
- Whoa, let me catch my breath here, hmm?

16:08.643 --> 16:11.243
- 100 million.
- 200 million.

16:11.245 --> 16:14.245
- 300 million.
- Whoa!

16:16.682 --> 16:20.783
I propose that the one with the most gold
will win this book for exactly $1 more

16:20.785 --> 16:23.919
than the losing bid. Deal?

16:23.921 --> 16:26.121
- Agreed.

16:26.123 --> 16:29.691
- Agreed.
- Alright.

16:29.693 --> 16:32.860
James here will check each
account to find out its limits.

16:32.862 --> 16:36.763
James?
- All set, boss.

16:36.765 --> 16:39.699
- Alright, we'll start with
Mr. Setrakian here.

16:41.469 --> 16:44.636
What's the grand total?
- Yes.

16:44.638 --> 16:47.771
What? Say it again?

16:50.275 --> 16:53.676
$323 million.

16:53.678 --> 16:57.312
(throat clearing)
- 323 mil?

16:57.314 --> 17:00.948
OK.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.150
This must be some kind of book.

17:03.152 --> 17:07.954
Alright. What about
the German here? What's he got?

17:07.956 --> 17:12.291
- You got the balance. Let me see it?
- Here's the number, boss.

17:12.293 --> 17:16.294
- $351.8 million.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.029
- (man): Damn!
(gavel banging)

17:18.031 --> 17:21.532
- Sold to the German for
323 million plus 1 buck.

17:21.534 --> 17:24.233
Transfer the gold to my
account, right the hell now.

17:24.259 --> 17:25.302
- You got it, Creem.

17:25.304 --> 17:27.971
- Give me the damn book.
- The game is over, Abraham.

17:27.973 --> 17:32.041
Nothing on this earth can stop
the Master now.

17:33.911 --> 17:36.144
Please,

17:36.146 --> 17:38.713
put it in a canvas bag
for me, would you?

17:38.715 --> 17:40.848
- For 323 million, hell,

17:40.850 --> 17:43.150
I'll gift wrap it if you want.

17:43.152 --> 17:45.318
- Yo, Creem.

17:49.323 --> 17:52.724
- You sure? What? Check again.

17:55.495 --> 17:58.729
The German's access to the Swiss
bank account has been rescinded.

17:58.731 --> 18:02.232
- That's ridiculous. Obviously
a mistake has been made.

18:02.234 --> 18:05.201
- It's not a mistake. They
checked twice. Access to

18:05.203 --> 18:07.736
the gold account is withdrawn.
Sorry, you're out of luck.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.416
I guess this is yours, old man.
Congratulations.

18:10.442 --> 18:11.673
I was rooting for you.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.841
- No!
- Whoa, whoa, that's far enough.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.610
Easy.
- Allow me to call the bank

18:16.612 --> 18:18.578
and rectify the situation.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.681
- No. 323 million
is 323 million.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.617
I ain't rectifying jack shit.
(growling)

18:24.619 --> 18:28.020
- Hey! This is your last
warning.

18:28.022 --> 18:31.056
(gun cocking)

18:31.058 --> 18:33.358
Try it.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.061
Go ahead. Do your thing.

18:37.063 --> 18:41.264
Step away.

18:43.201 --> 18:45.067
- It seems

18:45.069 --> 18:47.469
at the end of the day, Eldritch

18:47.471 --> 18:51.072
Palmer would rather I have the
book than let it fall

18:51.074 --> 18:53.474
into the hands of the Master.

18:53.476 --> 18:56.710
Interesting.

18:56.712 --> 18:59.212
(small laugh)

18:59.214 --> 19:01.314
- I congratulate you,

19:01.316 --> 19:03.783
A230385.

19:03.785 --> 19:07.219
(chuckling): I congratulate
you greatly.

19:07.221 --> 19:10.721
Enjoy this victory.

19:10.723 --> 19:13.824
Savour it.

19:13.826 --> 19:16.459
Plant it in your memory.

19:18.896 --> 19:21.329
I will see you soon.

19:21.331 --> 19:23.798
- Party's over. Off my island.

19:29.338 --> 19:31.471
(Creem chuckles)

19:31.473 --> 19:34.974
Thanks for making me rich,
old man.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.984
- Come on, Professor.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.990
- It's gonna be dark soon.
I hope you put some money aside

19:54.992 --> 19:57.492
to get a helicopter
or something.

20:08.504 --> 20:11.438
(indistinct orders)

20:11.440 --> 20:13.773
(distant siren)

20:13.775 --> 20:15.674
- (man): Hurry up.

20:15.676 --> 20:19.443
- 323 million smackeronis, huh?

20:19.445 --> 20:21.711
Yeesh.
- Be vigilant.

20:21.713 --> 20:24.447
The attack could come
from any direction.

20:24.449 --> 20:26.549
- Yeah.

20:26.551 --> 20:29.018
Why didn't you arrange
for backup?

20:29.020 --> 20:32.121
The Ancients, they paid a lot of
gold for this thing,

20:32.123 --> 20:34.456
you'd think they'd want to help.

20:34.458 --> 20:37.959
- Mr. Fet, there is something
I neglected to tell you.

20:37.961 --> 20:40.861
I'm not giving this book
to the Ancients.

20:42.631 --> 20:44.697
- OK...

20:44.699 --> 20:47.700
So, uh, we're ripping off

20:47.702 --> 20:50.302
one gang of immortal munchers

20:50.304 --> 20:53.738
and we're looking to throw down
against another?

20:53.740 --> 20:56.974
- That is an accurate
assessment.

20:56.976 --> 20:59.543
Is it much further?

20:59.545 --> 21:02.312
- Almost there.

21:02.314 --> 21:04.747
You know,

21:04.749 --> 21:07.416
you could have told me about
double-crossing--

21:07.418 --> 21:11.153
(truck roaring)
(shattering)

21:13.657 --> 21:15.323
(creaking)

21:15.325 --> 21:18.893
(distant snarling)
(small groan)

21:24.400 --> 21:27.100
- We need to move!

21:28.770 --> 21:30.870
(engine sputtering)
- Hang on!

21:30.872 --> 21:34.406
(growling and hissing)

21:37.677 --> 21:40.511
(shrieking)
(gunshots)

21:40.513 --> 21:42.846
(engine roaring)
Here we go!

21:42.848 --> 21:46.516
(tires squealing)

21:46.518 --> 21:48.918
Come on! Let's go!

21:50.855 --> 21:55.056
(Fet growling)
(creature croaking)

21:55.058 --> 21:58.025
- Damn thing's jammed!

21:59.762 --> 22:02.462
- Come on!
(metal screeching)

22:09.870 --> 22:12.536
Hang on!
(tires squealing)

22:14.373 --> 22:17.374
Go, Professor! Go!

22:30.121 --> 22:34.389
- (Eichorst, muffled): Abraham!
- Uh-oh.

22:36.893 --> 22:40.627
- As always, your victory
was fleeting.

22:42.897 --> 22:45.430
Bring me the book...

22:45.432 --> 22:48.633
and the Professor.
(creatures snarling)

22:53.839 --> 22:56.239
(thumping)

23:06.917 --> 23:09.517
- Let them know we're not
going easily!

23:43.452 --> 23:46.286
- Looks like somebody else
joined the party.

24:07.308 --> 24:09.474
(grunt)

24:11.644 --> 24:16.313
(low growling)

24:22.887 --> 24:26.755
- The Born.
- Can you see me through him?

24:32.496 --> 24:34.729
You were wise not to
come here tonight.

24:34.731 --> 24:37.264
Cowardly,

24:37.266 --> 24:39.699
but wise.

24:39.701 --> 24:43.568
- (Master's voice):
I fear no one.

24:43.570 --> 24:46.170
- Nor do I.

24:49.341 --> 24:51.507
(gunshots)

24:58.848 --> 25:00.848
(screeching)

25:00.850 --> 25:03.450
- Go, go, go!

25:29.711 --> 25:32.678
(beeping)

25:54.067 --> 25:56.801
- (Master's voice):
Nothing will hinder

25:56.803 --> 26:00.471
the rise of my power.

26:10.282 --> 26:13.082
-<i> Thanks, folks, for your</i>
<i>patience. We have been cleared</i>

26:13.084 --> 26:16.819
<i> for departure, and train</i>
<i> number 323, with stops</i>

26:16.821 --> 26:21.489
<i>in Washington DC, Charleston,</i>
<i> Savannah, Jacksonville,</i>

26:21.491 --> 26:25.692
<i>Orlando and terminating in</i>
<i>Tampa/Miami, is underway.</i>

26:25.694 --> 26:29.562
- Go back to sleep.

26:51.285 --> 26:55.219
- It's a long ride. I'm going to go
hit the Club Car before they run out.

26:57.856 --> 27:00.223
Excuse me?

27:03.361 --> 27:07.229
Sandwiches, drinks?
- Waters, please.

27:13.202 --> 27:16.269
- I'll be right back.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.217
- Great to be underway, huh?

27:33.219 --> 27:35.986
Where you headed?

27:35.988 --> 27:38.688
- Savannah.
- Nice.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.090
I'm going all the way to--
(thumping)

27:41.092 --> 27:43.325
What the hell's that?

27:43.327 --> 27:46.161
Something on the tracks?

27:46.163 --> 27:48.062
- Shit.

27:48.064 --> 27:51.231
(horn honking)
- We gotta stop!

27:52.500 --> 27:54.733
(brakes screeching)
(roaring)

27:54.735 --> 27:57.001
Whoa!
(glass shattering)

27:57.003 --> 27:59.003
(passengers screaming)

27:59.005 --> 28:01.905
(thumping)

28:01.907 --> 28:05.842
(screeching)

28:27.197 --> 28:29.931
- Eldritch, you have crossed

28:29.933 --> 28:32.400
a line that cannot be uncrossed.

28:32.402 --> 28:34.969
- Yes. Do you really believe

28:34.971 --> 28:36.737
that I am a man
to be trifled with?

28:36.739 --> 28:40.707
- Who are you to give orders?
Eldritch's pact isn't with you.

28:40.709 --> 28:44.376
- My dear, you will not speak
unless spoken to.

28:44.378 --> 28:46.544
- There he goes again.

28:46.546 --> 28:50.580
She can and will speak her mind.

28:50.582 --> 28:53.749
- You humiliated me
at the auction.

28:53.751 --> 28:55.884
You cost us the<i> Lumen.</i>

28:55.886 --> 28:58.152
But your most grievous crime was

28:58.154 --> 29:00.053
betraying the Master.

29:00.055 --> 29:02.622
- Please. It's Setrakian.

29:02.624 --> 29:05.591
My security team can have the
book back in our hands

29:05.593 --> 29:07.893
before he's translated
the title page --

29:07.895 --> 29:10.428
but only, ONLY,

29:10.430 --> 29:13.230
if you and your Master pay me
the respect I deserve!

29:13.232 --> 29:16.566
- How dare you.
- How dare you!

29:16.568 --> 29:19.902
Without Eldritch's influence,
without his abilities,

29:19.904 --> 29:23.871
without what he has done--
- I see who is deciding things.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.242
- We want the white
when we need it.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.011
You will help us;
we will help you. But as equals.

29:31.013 --> 29:34.114
That was, as I heard it,
the bargain.

29:34.116 --> 29:36.316
- What do you think,

29:36.318 --> 29:40.520
<i> mein Meister?</i>
(loud swoosh)

29:48.596 --> 29:52.531
- I see I've finally warranted
your attention.

29:56.937 --> 29:59.270
These new terms --

29:59.272 --> 30:01.438
the white for immortality --
do not

30:01.440 --> 30:03.440
materially affect our agreement.

30:03.442 --> 30:06.609
Use my resources as necessary

30:06.611 --> 30:08.611
but do not EVER

30:08.613 --> 30:10.813
take me for granted again.

30:10.815 --> 30:12.881
- The terms of our agreement

30:12.883 --> 30:15.083
remain unchanged.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.122
(The Master shrieks)
- No!

30:21.124 --> 30:23.958
No!
(whimpering)

30:23.960 --> 30:27.928
(gasping)
(slurping)

30:33.634 --> 30:36.635
(blubbering)

30:57.090 --> 31:01.425
- She has a new mate now,
Eldritch.

31:01.427 --> 31:05.662
Devotion is a beautiful thing.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
(panicked voices)

31:13.837 --> 31:16.270
- What just happened?

31:16.272 --> 31:18.672
- We've derailed.

31:18.674 --> 31:21.841
- (distant man):
I can't feel my neck!

31:23.444 --> 31:25.944
- Get your dagger!

31:44.097 --> 31:47.398
Come on!

31:47.400 --> 31:49.533
- What about Dad?

31:49.535 --> 31:52.536
- He'll find us. We can't wait.

31:57.208 --> 32:01.043
(creatures croaking)

32:08.652 --> 32:10.818
Come on!

32:12.388 --> 32:14.821
(woman screaming)
(creature shrieking)

32:24.665 --> 32:28.332
(distant shouting)
- Zack!

32:28.334 --> 32:31.134
(low snarl)

32:33.505 --> 32:37.540
(growling)
(heavy breathing)

32:40.077 --> 32:42.643
(shrieking)

32:44.346 --> 32:47.814
(woman screaming)
(man yelling)

33:01.295 --> 33:03.628
ZACK!

33:03.630 --> 33:06.897
NORA!

33:15.773 --> 33:18.840
ZACK!

33:22.878 --> 33:25.879
(snarling)

33:41.962 --> 33:46.030
(shrieking)

33:58.310 --> 34:00.476
- Watch out for the third rail.

34:00.478 --> 34:03.245
Come on, the station's close.

34:03.247 --> 34:07.816
(footsteps)

34:13.490 --> 34:16.791
Get behind me.

34:18.828 --> 34:21.595
When I say "run," you run.

34:21.597 --> 34:24.831
Get to the station.
Wait for your father or me.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.999
Got it?

34:34.241 --> 34:35.940
COME ON!

34:35.942 --> 34:40.177
I'M READY!
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

34:43.015 --> 34:45.348
(growling)

34:45.350 --> 34:47.850
(bullets pinging)

34:51.288 --> 34:54.254
(Nora yelling)
(Kelly shrieking)

34:56.691 --> 35:01.226
RUN!
(grunting)

35:01.228 --> 35:04.662
- (Kelly): Zack!

35:16.975 --> 35:19.375
(wheezing)

35:19.377 --> 35:21.377
- STOP!

35:21.379 --> 35:23.479
(croaking)

35:23.481 --> 35:25.547
- Ah!

35:25.549 --> 35:29.083
- No! Please!

35:29.085 --> 35:33.053
Let her go!
(groaning)

35:33.055 --> 35:35.889
Please.

35:35.891 --> 35:39.391
Stop.

35:39.393 --> 35:41.793
(slurping)

35:44.097 --> 35:48.132
(Nora groaning)

35:52.971 --> 35:57.974
(moaning)

36:03.681 --> 36:06.581
(shaky breathing)

36:06.583 --> 36:10.084
(coughing)

36:10.086 --> 36:12.019
- Zack.

36:12.021 --> 36:15.822
- Let me see you.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.607
Mom?

36:35.609 --> 36:37.842
(dagger clattering)

36:53.826 --> 36:56.193
- Zack.

37:03.969 --> 37:08.270
(indistinct voices whispering)

37:10.874 --> 37:13.875
- (Nora, strained): Zack!

37:37.233 --> 37:39.266
(distant horn)

37:39.268 --> 37:42.469
(distant sirens)

37:50.911 --> 37:53.444
(Setrakian grunting)
- That's it.

37:53.446 --> 37:56.180
There we go.

37:56.182 --> 37:58.882
Take your time.

37:58.884 --> 38:02.085
Alright, Professor.
We're all set.

38:02.087 --> 38:05.188
There she is! Huh?

38:05.190 --> 38:07.890
Home free.

38:07.892 --> 38:10.492
Alright.

38:13.129 --> 38:15.129
- Hey, pawnbroker!

38:15.131 --> 38:17.531
(guns cocking)

38:17.533 --> 38:19.699
- Try me, big boy.

38:19.701 --> 38:23.468
You're lucky I don't shoot you for
making me walk through that sewer.

38:23.470 --> 38:26.637
- Back off, man. Just walk away.

38:26.639 --> 38:29.706
- I'm talkin' to Mr. Setrakian.
You made a deal,

38:29.708 --> 38:32.709
old man. I'm here to see that
you honour it.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.777
- Who the hell is this guy,
anyway?

38:34.779 --> 38:36.712
- Former customer.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.415
I am not giving
this book to you,

38:40.417 --> 38:43.217
or to the Ancients,
or to anyone.

38:43.219 --> 38:46.887
I'm going to walk onto that boat
and either you are going

38:46.889 --> 38:50.056
to shoot me and Mr. Fet is going
to shoot you, or--

38:50.058 --> 38:53.591
- Or, I could kill both of you.

38:53.593 --> 38:56.994
- This guy!

38:59.732 --> 39:02.599
- Mr. Quinlan, you did not come
all this way

39:02.601 --> 39:05.134
to do the Ancients' bidding.

39:05.136 --> 39:08.070
I know who you are.
- Do you?

39:08.072 --> 39:10.806
- I know what you want.
It is not this book.

39:10.808 --> 39:14.609
- Same old pawnbroker,
making deals.

39:14.611 --> 39:18.078
Careful, Quinlan, you're gonna
end up with a broken clock.

39:19.614 --> 39:22.026
- The Ancients will
destroy this book rather

39:22.052 --> 39:24.116
than allow its secrets
to be revealed.

39:24.118 --> 39:28.986
And when they do, they will destroy the one
item in this world The Master desires.

39:30.522 --> 39:32.755
- But as long as this book
exists...

39:32.757 --> 39:36.658
- It is bait! Do you want
the Master?

39:36.660 --> 39:38.960
He will come for whoever
possesses it.

39:38.962 --> 39:41.362
That I guarantee you.

39:47.436 --> 39:49.602
- Nora? Zack?

39:49.604 --> 39:53.772
(Nora gasping)
Nora!

39:53.774 --> 39:57.207
Where's Zack? Where is he?

39:59.978 --> 40:02.979
- She took him.
- She turned him?

40:02.981 --> 40:05.781
- (hiccupping): No.

40:05.783 --> 40:09.551
She took him away with her.

40:12.956 --> 40:17.391
Don't! Don't come close.

40:21.496 --> 40:23.829
- We can manage this.

40:23.831 --> 40:26.364
I can figure something out.

40:28.368 --> 40:31.401
- You're always late.

40:33.505 --> 40:36.506
I already hear his voice in me.

40:36.508 --> 40:39.575
His will creeping into mine.

40:39.577 --> 40:42.811
I don't want him
to hear your words,

40:42.813 --> 40:46.014
to see you through my eyes.

40:46.016 --> 40:51.051
- Nora!
- I would come for you.

40:52.988 --> 40:55.922
I would come for you and Zack.

40:55.924 --> 40:59.058
- Please don't leave me.

41:03.163 --> 41:06.731
- It's done.

41:06.733 --> 41:09.099
(Ephraim gasps)
(muffled bang)

41:11.870 --> 41:14.537
(muffled yell)

41:14.539 --> 41:17.640
(slow music plays)

42:12.763 --> 42:16.531
- I don't know about this,
Professor.

42:22.571 --> 42:24.971
Well?

42:24.973 --> 42:27.239
- Somewhere in here

42:27.241 --> 42:30.908
is the key to the Master's
origin and,

42:30.910 --> 42:33.944
hopefully, his demise.

42:33.946 --> 42:37.013
- You can figure it out
though, right?

42:37.015 --> 42:39.348
- In time, yes.

42:39.350 --> 42:41.416
- In time?

42:41.418 --> 42:44.585
We've got a stolen book
on a stolen boat,

42:44.587 --> 42:47.621
sailing down a river. We have
no idea where we're going,

42:47.623 --> 42:51.791
Mexican gangbangers and
a half-breed<i> strigoi</i> on board.

42:51.793 --> 42:54.260
The Ancients and the Master
are after us.

42:54.262 --> 42:57.596
I'm sure we've got plenty of
time, Professor.

42:59.700 --> 43:02.834
<i> -</i> (Setrakian):<i> Long ago,</i>
<i> I pledged my life</i>

43:02.836 --> 43:06.170
<i>to opposing these monsters.</i>

43:06.172 --> 43:09.606
<i> Since then, I have lost</i>
<i> everything dear to me,</i>

43:09.608 --> 43:11.307
<i>driven to the edge of madness</i>

43:11.309 --> 43:14.843
<i>in my quest for knowledge</i>
<i> and vengeance.</i>

43:14.845 --> 43:18.346
<i>Now, one step away from victory,</i>

43:18.348 --> 43:21.782
<i>why do I feel more trepidation</i>
<i> than triumph?</i>

43:21.784 --> 43:25.451
<i> What insidious plan</i>
<i> does the Master</i>

43:25.453 --> 43:28.220
<i> have for humankind?</i>

43:28.222 --> 43:31.889
<i>We have become overconfident</i>

43:31.891 --> 43:33.790
<i> as a species.</i>

43:33.792 --> 43:36.559
<i> We ignorantly believed</i>
<i> in our primacy</i>

43:36.561 --> 43:38.794
<i> over all else --</i>

43:38.796 --> 43:40.829
<i> over all other species,</i>

43:40.831 --> 43:43.731
<i> over our planet itself.</i>

43:51.373 --> 43:55.441
<i>Will we perish under our own</i>
<i> greed and selfishness?</i>

44:02.983 --> 44:07.318
<i>Or will we overcome and survive?</i>

44:09.322 --> 44:13.991
<i> A short time ago,</i>
<i> our current reality</i>

44:13.993 --> 44:16.827
<i> was beyond imagination.</i>

44:16.829 --> 44:20.496
<i>Now we have one last chance</i>

44:20.498 --> 44:23.632
<i> to win back our world.</i>

44:25.836 --> 44:28.169
<i>In order to defeat the Master,</i>

44:28.171 --> 44:31.105
<i>we must be as cold and ruthless</i>

44:31.107 --> 44:33.640
<i> and savage as he is...</i>

44:37.244 --> 44:40.011
<i>...and yet without becoming</i>

44:40.013 --> 44:42.746
<i> monsters ourselves.</i>
