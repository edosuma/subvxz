<i>- Previously on St. Elsewhere.
- I'm Dr. Paxton.</i>

00:04.650 --> 00:06.585
How do you know so much
about birds, Ralph?

00:06.652 --> 00:08.220
I am a bird.

00:08.287 --> 00:11.623
And now you walk back
into my life and it's like
you never left.

00:11.690 --> 00:14.793
<i>Until we meet again,
mon Petit Chou-Fleur.</i>

00:14.860 --> 00:16.628
Oh, Dr. Bullfinch.

00:16.695 --> 00:19.565
I will not have this man
running around here
playing Doctor.

00:19.631 --> 00:22.801
<i>Tonight on st. Elsewhere.
Call the Code.
Get an O.R. Ready.</i>

00:22.868 --> 00:24.603
Tell them gunshot wound
to the chest.

00:24.670 --> 00:27.005
It's 10 years, Nance.
I mean, I've changed.

00:27.072 --> 00:29.775
So have I. If this were
10 years ago, I'd jump
into bed with you right now.

00:29.841 --> 00:32.311
He's not gonna make it
through the night, Jack.

00:32.377 --> 00:34.313
You mean you're not
gonna be a bird anymore?
That's right.

00:34.379 --> 00:37.149
I'm gonna be a human,
24 hours a day, every day.

00:37.216 --> 00:40.786
<i>- This boy is dead and gone.
- He's not dead
till I say he's dead.</i>

00:40.852 --> 00:44.323
<i>[ speaking chinese ]
they really think
This is gonna save him?</i>

00:44.389 --> 00:47.025
<i>- Yes.
- You think I'm gonna jump,
don't you?</i>

00:47.092 --> 00:49.494
- Come on, Ralph.
- Stand right there, Hugh.

02:27.759 --> 02:30.529
<i>So the guy asks, he says,
"who gave you the 50 cents?"
yeah?</i>

02:30.596 --> 02:33.498
<i>And she says, "they all did."
[ both laughing ]</i>

02:33.565 --> 02:36.768
<i>Oh, you know mrs. Wilder,
the one recovering
in the burn unit?</i>

02:36.835 --> 02:41.240
Yeah, what about her?
She found her husband
in bed with another woman.

02:41.306 --> 02:44.009
Working can wait.
This is Paradise.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.378
<i>So what does she do?
She's a real einstein,
this woman.</i>

02:46.445 --> 02:51.083
She gets a gallon of gasoline.
She douses them all with it.
Lights a match and whoo!

02:51.149 --> 02:53.151
<i>- Blows them all up.
- [ clattering ]</i>

02:53.218 --> 02:56.622
take it easy, fella.
So flash forward
to the burn unit, okay?

02:56.688 --> 02:58.924
<i>They're all bandaged up.
They're all
in these big dressings.</i>

02:58.991 --> 03:01.593
They look like
enormous cookie monsters, okay?

03:01.660 --> 03:03.595
And they just start
whaling on each other.

03:03.662 --> 03:05.330
Who?

03:05.397 --> 03:08.333
Mrs. Wilder and the woman
she found in bed
with her husband.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.371
â™ªâ™ª [ singing, indistinct ]
they're in the same room
together?

03:12.437 --> 03:15.207
Right next to each other,
beating each other up.
Are you listening to my story?

03:15.274 --> 03:17.576
Of course, Ehrlich.
I'm simply recapitulating.

03:17.643 --> 03:19.778
It's a rhetorical
device.
Oh.

03:19.845 --> 03:21.813
His mind's somewhere else.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.916
Dr. Paxton.

03:26.151 --> 03:28.787
Oh, come, come, Dr. Samuels.
You think we haven't noticed:

03:28.854 --> 03:30.789
The glazed look,
the heavy breathing?

03:30.856 --> 03:35.360
Not to mention you've been
walking around like secretariat
after he's put out to stud.

03:35.427 --> 03:38.530
Or how your obnoxious,
detached, patronizing manner...

03:38.597 --> 03:42.134
melts into a rabid
sexual yearning every time
she enters the room.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.003
It's really quite touching...
for someone your age.

03:45.070 --> 03:48.173
I haven't the vaguest idea
of what you're talking about,
Fiscus.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.644
The truth. Wouldn't you
like to take a tumble
with Nancy Paxton?

03:52.711 --> 03:55.380
Raise a Nickel.

03:55.447 --> 03:57.816
- A Nickel?
- That's right.

03:57.883 --> 04:00.819
I see your laxative, Lyle,

04:00.886 --> 04:04.223
and I raise you
two thiamine.

04:04.289 --> 04:08.026
You mean to tell me that
you're here of your own free
volition on a saturday night?

04:08.093 --> 04:10.195
Certainly.
Yes, I'm sure
the fact...

04:10.262 --> 04:13.098
that Dr. Paxton is on call
has nothing to do with it.

04:13.165 --> 04:16.902
Nice hands, Ehrlich.
You, uh, wanna be a surgeon?

04:16.969 --> 04:20.005
Uh, wh-What's the limit?

04:20.072 --> 04:22.341
Morphine.
Anything over-the-Counter goes.

04:22.407 --> 04:25.510
You mean I have to explain
why I wanna play cards...

04:25.577 --> 04:27.512
with My colleagues
every saturday night?

04:27.579 --> 04:30.849
With Your track record,
Samuels? Yeah.

04:30.916 --> 04:32.918
<i>Listen to this.
I'm gonna sit here...</i>

04:32.985 --> 04:36.755
and take this kind of abuse
from someone who has the nerve
to raise me a Nickel-- a Nickel?

04:36.822 --> 04:40.726
<i>Is that any kind of way
for an adult to conduct himself
in a poker game, Stephens?</i>

04:40.792 --> 04:43.729
- What do you got?
- Two pair.

04:45.631 --> 04:48.500
Dermatologists
and radiologists,
the lowest of the low.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.503
Three 7's.

04:51.570 --> 04:54.239
I can't stand it.
I never win.

04:54.306 --> 04:56.975
- a boat.
- Holy smoke.

04:57.042 --> 05:01.880
Sorry to win and run,
gentlemen, but there's
simply no competition.

05:01.947 --> 05:04.116
Listen, Stephens,
a word of advice.

05:04.182 --> 05:07.152
When you're playing with adults,
do not raise a laxative.

05:10.255 --> 05:12.190
- I never win.
- uppers?

05:12.257 --> 05:15.727
No, vitamin "E."

05:27.205 --> 05:29.174
Hi.
Hi.

05:29.241 --> 05:33.078
You mind if I sit down?
Fine.

05:33.145 --> 05:37.282
So, uh,
how's it going?

05:37.349 --> 05:40.118
Fine.
Oh, Good. Good.

05:40.185 --> 05:42.221
And your life?

05:42.287 --> 05:45.257
Fine.
[ snickers ]

05:45.324 --> 05:47.259
it's saturday night.
What are you doing here anyway?

05:47.326 --> 05:50.796
Well, you might as well know--
I guess everyone else does--
I came to see you.

05:52.130 --> 05:55.067
Oh.
Apparently I'm wearing
my heart on my sleeve.

05:55.133 --> 05:57.236
Or haven't you noticed?

05:57.302 --> 06:00.072
Well, you've been
very friendly.
[ laughing ]

06:00.138 --> 06:04.343
I appreciate that.
I see. You're not gonna
make this easy for me, are you?

06:04.409 --> 06:09.448
Ten years, Ben.
There's a lot of blood
spilled in our relationship.

06:09.514 --> 06:11.516
You still don't forgive me
for leaving?

06:11.583 --> 06:16.021
Oh, I forgive you, sure.
It's a lot Harder to Forget.

06:16.088 --> 06:19.291
Look, if I could change
what happened, what I did,
you know--

06:19.358 --> 06:21.293
I don't expect you to.
If I could, I would.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.931
You're not listening, Ben.
I forgive you. Really, I do.

06:25.998 --> 06:30.869
You mean,
what I'm feeling,

06:30.936 --> 06:33.705
you don't feel
anything like that?

06:33.772 --> 06:37.843
Ben, I'm crazy about you.
Well, wonderful.

06:37.910 --> 06:40.178
So, what's the problem?

06:40.245 --> 06:43.015
I'm not crazy about you
that way.

06:43.081 --> 06:45.684
It's 10 years, Nance.
I mean, I've changed.

06:45.751 --> 06:48.387
So have I. If this were
10 years ago, I'd jump
into bed with you right now.

06:48.453 --> 06:51.557
Look, you know,
you are throwing out
very mixed signals here.

06:51.623 --> 06:54.560
No, I'm not.
I'm trying to be as honest
with you as I can.

06:54.626 --> 06:57.796
Well--
I think
you're irresponsible.

06:57.863 --> 07:00.365
Not to your work
but to people.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.069
I would have gone
anywhere with you.

07:04.136 --> 07:06.238
I would have done
anything.

07:08.206 --> 07:11.810
It took me a very long time
to get to the point...

07:11.877 --> 07:15.781
where you don't interfere
with my living my life.

07:15.847 --> 07:18.183
And now you don't.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.185
I like my life.
I like what I'm doing.

07:20.252 --> 07:23.121
I am perfectly happy.

07:23.188 --> 07:26.024
I'm dying for you.
[ laughs ]

07:26.091 --> 07:28.026
you won't die, Ben.
I didn't.

07:28.093 --> 07:30.128
Besides that,
it'd probably
be a big disappointment.

07:30.195 --> 07:33.865
Not a chance.
Now you know that's not True,
don't you?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.603
I couldn't go through it
again, Ben.

07:38.904 --> 07:40.906
I don't want to.

07:46.511 --> 07:51.516
<i>[ cooing ]</i>

08:07.199 --> 08:11.570
you spoiled the mood, Hugh.
You always spoil the mood.

08:11.637 --> 08:16.108
Still can't sleep, huh?
Not can't, won't.
Too much to think about.

08:16.174 --> 08:19.111
Yeah, well, I'll have them
give you something
that will help.

08:19.177 --> 08:21.880
Help me sleep
or help me think?

08:21.947 --> 08:25.284
Really, I don't feel
like sleeping.

08:28.053 --> 08:31.189
I think perhaps
you're right after all.

08:31.256 --> 08:34.893
Maybe it's time
I stop being a bird.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.530
I've been every species of bird
known to humankind,

08:38.597 --> 08:41.832
and it still hasn't helped.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.203
The question is then
what should I be?

08:45.270 --> 08:49.141
Well, that's a very good
question, Ralph.

08:51.343 --> 08:54.346
Maybe I'll just be myself.

08:54.413 --> 08:57.883
I like that answer.
I thought you would.

09:03.555 --> 09:05.958
It's a Crisp,
cool night.

09:06.024 --> 09:09.895

than any city in the world.

09:16.401 --> 09:19.238
<i>Too much humidity, Hugh.
Not for me.</i>

09:19.304 --> 09:21.506
What are you doing
in Boston anyway, Hugh?

09:21.573 --> 09:25.110
You're like a duck
out of water up here.

09:25.177 --> 09:28.614
I can see you
in mobile, alabama
or tuscaloosa.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.285
But you a Boston brahmin?
I got sick of pawpaws.

09:33.352 --> 09:37.756
Do you ever miss it?
Gulfport, mississippi,
I mean.

09:37.823 --> 09:41.560
Not the place so much--
Mostly I miss my people.

09:41.627 --> 09:45.163
Your folks still there?
Mm-Hmm.

09:45.230 --> 09:50.168
It's funny.
I've spent so much time
being angry at my folks.

09:50.235 --> 09:52.738
How do you feel
about them now?

09:52.804 --> 09:57.009
I feel sorry for them.
They've realized how badly
they screwed things up.

09:57.075 --> 09:59.011
Ralph--
No, I know, I know.

09:59.077 --> 10:03.081
They weren't sure what
to do with a kid who was
supposed to be a genius.

10:03.148 --> 10:05.083
They thought what
they were doing was right.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.419
They were told that m.I.T.
Was the best place for you.

10:07.486 --> 10:10.222
I was 14 years old
my freshman year.

10:10.289 --> 10:12.991
I didn't shave
till I was 18.

10:13.058 --> 10:15.861
My parents never knew
how to act around me.

10:15.928 --> 10:18.864
Now they can't bear
to see me.

10:18.931 --> 10:22.200
So I don't know how to
act around them...

10:22.267 --> 10:25.804
or anyone else
for that matter.

10:25.871 --> 10:30.709
The only person
who I ever felt comfortable
with was Jane,

10:30.776 --> 10:33.278
the mother of my child.

10:34.413 --> 10:36.882
Have you spoken
to her recently?

10:36.949 --> 10:40.185
I talked to her
on the phone a week ago.

10:40.252 --> 10:44.489
She sounds happy.
I feel happy for her.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.758
She's moving to arizona.
Yeah.

10:46.825 --> 10:49.027
I think being With
her father's the best thing
for her, don't you?

10:49.094 --> 10:51.430
Yes, yes, I do.

10:53.465 --> 10:57.402
"Things fall apart.
The center cannot hold."

10:57.469 --> 11:00.572
What's that?
That's from a poem
by Yeats.

11:00.639 --> 11:03.909
Sort of describes
my relation to the world.

11:03.976 --> 11:05.911
I don't know what
to do with the world,

11:05.978 --> 11:08.046
and the world doesn't
know what to make of me.

11:11.383 --> 11:15.854
<i>[ Paxton ]
How are his pupils?</i>

11:15.921 --> 11:18.056
<i>Sluggish.
His temperature's Normal.</i>

11:18.123 --> 11:21.126
That's not necessarily
a good sign.

11:21.193 --> 11:23.495
The body's response to infection
is to produce fever.

11:23.562 --> 11:26.732
If there's no fever,
it means he's not fighting
off the infection.

11:26.798 --> 11:29.368
Any response
to deep pain stimulation?

11:38.543 --> 11:40.512
No.

but they're not fixed.

only minimally to light.

Has he been decerebrating?

Yes.

His brain's not active.

11:58.497 --> 12:02.534
It's obviously
very infected.

12:02.601 --> 12:04.970
I don't understand.

12:05.037 --> 12:08.674
It's too fast.
We're losing him.

12:12.110 --> 12:15.614
He's not gonna make it

Hey, any chance of me

Sure.

how long you look at them.

Okay, okay.

more action, okay?
Is this True, Ben?

Why did you leave me, Ben?

46:13.619 --> 46:16.288
I was young...

46:16.355 --> 46:20.659
and scared
and shallow and...

46:20.726 --> 46:22.628
very stupid.

46:24.563 --> 46:27.599
You were the golden boy.

46:27.666 --> 46:29.668
Oh, you had the world
at your feet.

46:29.735 --> 46:31.904
Yep.

46:31.970 --> 46:37.109
I remember you saying you were
going to be chief of surgery
by the time you were 35.

46:37.175 --> 46:40.279
And not just at any hospital--
Mount Sinai.

46:40.345 --> 46:43.782
Yeah, Well,
that was a long time ago,
wasn't it?

46:45.717 --> 46:47.619
What happened?

46:49.454 --> 46:53.058
Life. It threw me
a couple of curves.
Could never hit a curve.

46:53.125 --> 46:56.428
Sure, you could.

46:56.495 --> 47:02.034
Could I?
Anytime, anywhere.

47:03.936 --> 47:07.539
Do you still want
the same things?

47:07.606 --> 47:09.508
Uh--

47:11.143 --> 47:14.613
no, I don't think
about that much anymore.

47:14.680 --> 47:18.317
You know, when I used to see
a closed door, I had to know
what was behind it.

47:18.383 --> 47:23.155
And now I... walk By.

47:23.222 --> 47:25.991
That's too bad.

47:26.058 --> 47:28.827
Maybe.
