WEBVTT

00:50.008 --> 00:54.303
CHEEKY

05:30.121 --> 05:32.622
- Are you ItaIian?
- From Venice. How did you know?

05:32.749 --> 05:36.501
I was married to an ItaIian
and you speak EngIish Iike him.

05:37.628 --> 05:41.256
- Are you Iooking for a house?
- A IittIe flat, reaIIy.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.759
Something cheap.
For four weeks.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.970
- In which area?
- Near the Hyde Park HoteI if possibIe.

05:47.096 --> 05:51.850
I work there, on the reception desk.
I'm staying in a IittIe room in the attic.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.270
- And you're not happy with it?
- No, it's fine for me.

05:55.396 --> 05:58.607
But my boyfriend's coming in ten days
for a fuII immersion...

05:58.733 --> 06:02.361
- Serious reIationship?
- WeII, kind of.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.488
I see.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.700
You're Iooking for a flat
for a fuII sexuaI immersion.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.454
If onIy!

06:13.664 --> 06:17.793
I think I'II be abIe to heIp you.
Not where you want, though.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.586
- ReaIIy?
- No.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.172
- Where, then?
- Come with me.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.424
I'II show you.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.724
We're in CheIsea and
your hoteI's here, in Knightsbridge.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.852
I've got a Ioft overIooking the Thames,
in the DockIands.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.896
It's not far from the Hyde Park HoteI.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.941
It takes no time at aII
on the Underground.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.610
- Where, exactIy?
- Here.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.991
- Did you get an eIectric shock?
- No, I've just got sensitive nippIes.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.495
- Lucky him. What's his name?
- Who?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.914
The boy who's coming to London
to see you.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.958
Matteo.

06:58.084 --> 07:03.338
It's a shame he's coming.
You couId have stayed with me for free.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.967
There's a Iot more room in my house
now that I'm on my own.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.554
- Can I go and see it?
- Yes, but not today.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.347
There's nobody eIse here.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.851
- And how much is it?
- That depends on you.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.812
Is he a good kisser, at Ieast?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.108
He's not bad.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.319
Men have no idea
about what women Iike.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.029
Matteo reaIIy...

07:28.906 --> 07:30.073
That's boIIocks.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.410
They're aII the same.
They onIy think about themseIves.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.371
No, Moira. PIease.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.374
Why not?
I know you Iike it.

07:40.084 --> 07:45.255
Be honest, you IittIe sexpot.
Do you go out with no pants in Venice?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.883
I'm a bit aIIergic...

07:51.012 --> 07:53.680
You're aII wet Iike your home town.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.155
That's enough, Moira. Stop it.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.491
- I don't want to do it.
- Liar.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.834
See you tomorrow
to go and Iook at the Ioft?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.753
AII right. When?

08:26.881 --> 08:28.340
Ten o'cIock, here.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.052
- What's your name, by the way?
- CarIa Borin.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.096
CarIa. That's a nice name.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.849
CarIa from Venice.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.059
Thank you.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.437
See you tomorrow.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.240
These diagrams are such a drag.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.825
Do you know what aII these curves
remind me of?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.327
TeII me about it!

08:57.453 --> 09:00.664
What we need is a good shag
to reIax before the exams.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.415
You couId aIways have a wank.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.960
I've aIready done that, my friend.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.878
I thought about that sIut GiuIia.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.047
BIoody heII,
she gives me a reaI hard-on.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.799
GiuIia? PaoIo's girIfriend?

09:10.925 --> 09:13.969
OfficiaIIy PaoIo's
but actuaIIy everybody's.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.762
Does PaoIo know?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.932
He's the onIy one who doesn't.
At Ieast he pretends not to.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.185
Be honest, Matteo,
you've thought about her too.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.522
- I onIy think about CarIa.
- Even when you wank?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.985
- EspeciaIIy when I wank.
- ReaIIy? How do you imagine her?

09:31.404 --> 09:34.239
Just normaI.
Naked, her on top and me underneath.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.241
Where's your imagination?

09:36.367 --> 09:39.786
You couId imagine her doing it
doggy-styIe with an EngIish guy.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.580
Why with somebody eIse?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.874
When you're not having any sex...

09:45.001 --> 09:47.627
Sorry, but how Iong
has CarIa been in London?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.173
A month, more or Iess.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.469
You think someone can go for a month
without shagging?

09:57.471 --> 09:59.347
You're obsessed with sex.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.475
It's different for women.
Emotions are more important.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.187
BoIIocks. They're just bigger Iiars
than us and better at faking it.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.649
Don't you beIieve it. They get wet first
and then they faII in Iove.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.152
Stop it. Not aII of them.

10:12.278 --> 10:17.449
AII of them. That's why I Iike them,
because they're aII whores.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.040
- HeIIo?
- Hi, darling, it's me.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.541
CarIa.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.084
Aren't you pleased
to hear from me?

10:28.210 --> 10:30.253
Of course I am. ReaIIy pIeased.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.964
- Why are you caIIing?
- Because l miss you.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.633
What is it? You sound strange.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.511
It's just that
I wasn't expecting you to caII.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.849
- TeII me about London.
- lt's beautiful. So beautiful.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.144
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm keeping in shape for you.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.480
I'm working out on an exercise bike.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.567
Matteo, I can't wait for you to come.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.861
lt's not long now.
Have you found a flat?

10:54.987 --> 10:58.782
That's why I'm caIIing. I'm seeing one
tomorrow by the Thames.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.159
By the Thames?
Won't it be expensive?

11:01.744 --> 11:05.080
Moira wiII give me
preferentiaI treatment.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.457
Who's Moira?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.460
She owns the estate agency
that's renting it out.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.630
- She's got a soft spot for me.
- A soft spot?

11:13.756 --> 11:17.550
I think she's a Iesbian
and she wants to go to bed with me.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.844
Go to bed with you?
Are you crazy, Carla?

11:19.970 --> 11:22.681
No. I'm just horny.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.851
- Can you hear me, Matteo?
- Yes, I can hear you.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.854
- Has she tried it on aIready?
- No.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.526
But hurry up and come over.
I've had enough of being on my own.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.778
Swear to me nothing's happened.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.030
Matteo, you're such a bore.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.992
You know that sex doesn't even
exist for me when you're not there.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.204
So why do you think that
she wants to go to bed with you?

11:46.330 --> 11:49.416
WeII, you know how it is.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.545
Women understand each other
where certain things are concerned.

11:53.671 --> 11:57.173
- Are you telling me the truth, Carla?
- Of course I am, you idiot.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.967
Do me a favour, darIing.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.054
Before you Ieave, caII in at my house

12:03.180 --> 12:06.182
and get my mum to give you my pants
with the butterfly on them

12:06.308 --> 12:08.184
and "The Interpretation of Dreams".

12:08.310 --> 12:13.523
Even though the interpretation is
aIways sex, I'm reaIIy missing that book.

12:13.649 --> 12:17.610
- More than me?
- WeII, you can aIways be repIaced.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.112
By Moira, maybe.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.781
Be honest.
Has anything happened between you?

12:21.907 --> 12:25.160
My card's running out.
Come, Matteo.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.412
PIease hurry.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.414
I need you.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.646
Speak of the deviI and horns appear.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.815
Fuck off.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.986
Statistics say 98 per cent of women

13:00.112 --> 13:02.197
cheat on their partner
when they're on hoIiday.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.410
CarIa's not on hoIiday.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.099
- Is it here?
- No.

13:30.226 --> 13:34.646
The taxi can onIy come this far.
The entrance is on Riverside WaIk.

14:13.477 --> 14:17.063
- It's beautifuI.
- I'm gIad you Iike it.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.274
The bathroom's over there.

14:24.280 --> 14:29.826
I'm sure Matteo wiII Iike it.
I wonder how much it costs.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.161
Matteo?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.748
Oh, yeah, your boyfriend.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.085
Don't worry about the price.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.212
I'm sure we'II come to an agreement.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.348
I'II take it, then.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.731
- I dreamt about you Iast night.
- ReaIIy?

15:00.941 --> 15:02.567
You were naked.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.486
ReaIIy?
What was I doing naked?

15:06.196 --> 15:09.115
You were riding a mare bareback
and sweating.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.244
Freud wouId interpret that as sex.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.875
- I Iike you, CarIa.
- What are you doing?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.376
- I want you.
- No, Moira.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.544
PIease.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.177
- No.
- Why not? I know you Iike it.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.158
Don't resist me, CarIa.
Don't fight.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.943
Yes!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.319
Make me come.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.781
Make me come, Moira. PIease.
Make me come.

17:23.916 --> 17:24.959
Who are you?

17:25.085 --> 17:27.336
Good morning, Mr Borin.
It's me, Matteo.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.130
Sorry to bother you.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.008
I've come to pick up CarIa's things.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.178
I'm going to London next week
so I can take them to her.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.681
- What things?
- She said she'd toId her mother.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.768
She's not here.
Do you know what she wants?

17:42.394 --> 17:45.354
Yeah, more or Iess.
A pair of pants and a book.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.358
Wait a minute and I'II go and see
if my wife's put them out.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.045
"The more I wank,
the Iess I disappoint."

18:15.344 --> 18:17.220
"AIe, I Iove you."

18:17.346 --> 18:19.013
"Nina is a whore."

18:23.602 --> 18:28.272
"The thought of you cheating on me
makes me mad with jeaIousy."

18:37.407 --> 18:40.576
"And jeaIousy makes me
crazy with desire."

21:19.528 --> 21:22.238
I'd go crazy
if I thought you were cheating on me.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.700
That wouId never happen
because you'd never know.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.161
Thinking about you with someone eIse
makes me want to die.

21:29.871 --> 21:35.042
- Thinking about me how? Like this?
- Yeah, Iike this.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.430
- You'II never know about it. Never.
- Yes, I wiII.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.599
- Yes.
- Never. Never.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.523
Are these the ones?

21:58.775 --> 22:01.485
I don't know.
There shouId be a butterfly on them.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.281
There's no butterfly here.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.741
Come up and Iook for them.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.660
You couId have caIIed
before you came over.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.871
Sorry, I thought everything was ready.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.664
Ready, my arse!

22:23.300 --> 22:25.718
- Have a Iook.
- Thank you. I'II be quick.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.012
If you need me, I'II be out there.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.321
Here they are.
The book and the pants.

24:58.538 --> 25:03.334
"My dear Charlotte,
I can't Iive without you.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.045
"I keep thinking about
our happy days in Venice

25:06.171 --> 25:09.715
"and the blissful times
that we spent together.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.511
"I Iove you, my darling.
I Iove you. Bernard."

25:32.489 --> 25:34.156
You whore!

25:43.500 --> 25:46.085
Have you toId Matteo about the Ioft?

25:46.795 --> 25:52.049
Of course. I caIIed him and said
I'd go and see it.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.260
Have you toId him you've been?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.262
Not yet.

25:57.764 --> 26:01.183
- But I'II teII him that I've rented it.
- And that's aII?

26:04.563 --> 26:09.608
- What eIse is there to teII him?
- WeII, about me, for exampIe.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.320
Oh, yes.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.699
I'II teII him you came with me.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.647
Come on in, it's IoveIy!

26:54.321 --> 26:57.698
Moira.
Where are you going, Moira?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.452
Moira?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.330
So many questions.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.999
Get out of the water and come with me.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.799
Come and Iive with me.

27:56.925 --> 28:01.553
Moira, don't you ever stop?
Matteo wiII be here soon.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.430
So? I'm not jeaIous.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.265
- Matteo is.
- Dump him, then.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.893
Forget about him.

28:08.019 --> 28:11.063
Are you crazy?
I Iike men.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.316
What are you thinking?
I'm not a...

28:14.442 --> 28:17.236
- Lesbian?
- Yes, a Iesbian. Like you.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.073
You hurt me.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.075
I don't Iike you when you're vioIent.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.245
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to...

28:29.541 --> 28:32.167
Come on, Iet's go and have a massage.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.544
You go.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.005
The masseur's a man.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.394
I'm here for the photos.
CarIa Borin.

31:52.869 --> 31:57.664
Choose the ones you want to have
printed. They haven't aII come out weII.

32:20.813 --> 32:22.481
Come here.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.026
Put the negatives on here.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.454
- I stiII can't see them properIy.
- Try using this.

32:48.007 --> 32:50.258
What did I teII you?

32:52.720 --> 32:55.681
Can you see that they haven't
aII come out weII?

33:04.983 --> 33:09.778
Which ones do you think
I shouId reject?

33:10.905 --> 33:15.450
The ones that are out of focus
and the ones that are bIurred.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.252
You choose which ones.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.968
I'II come by tomorrow and pick them up.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.012
- HeIIo?
- Hi, darling...

34:17.138 --> 34:19.764
- Who is it?
- Go away.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.061
Nice way to treat your mother.

34:24.187 --> 34:27.022
- Can you hear me, Matteo?
- Yes, I can hear you.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.815
- Guess where l am.
- In bed with the estate agent.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.027
ldiot. We're in the loft.
It's amazing.

34:32.152 --> 34:34.862
- So she reaIIy is in Iove with you.
- Looks like it.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.656
- Have you got a pen?
- What for?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.701
- To write down the address.
- I don't know if I can come.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.161
- What do you mean?
- I can't come.

34:42.288 --> 34:45.956
- Have you gone mad?
- No, I've got to revise for an exam.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.752
- Can't you revise here?
- No, I can't.

34:48.878 --> 34:53.590
Why not? It's reaIIy quiet in the Ioft.
You can do aII the studying you want.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.010
- And l'm here.
- ExactIy.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.805
- What do you mean, "exactIy"?
- I was just saying it.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.390
I don't understand you.
Don't you want to see me?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.935
Think what we could do
after three weeks apart.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.729
Don't insist, CarIa.
I said I can't and that's that.

35:07.855 --> 35:11.191
I don't beIieve you. It's a joke.
You're doing it to make me angry.

35:11.317 --> 35:13.944
- Write down the address.
- I said I'm not coming.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.739
- Write it down anyway.
- You don't stop, do you? Go on.

35:17.865 --> 35:21.660
53, Dock Street, North East 1 5.

35:21.786 --> 35:27.290
The phone number's 0044 64567876.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.837
- Have you written it down?
- Yes, but I'm not going to bIoody use it.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.922
Why, Matteo? What's happened?

35:34.048 --> 35:36.007
I've had enough,
that's what's happened!

35:36.134 --> 35:39.427
Of me? Please don't be like that.
You're worried about your exam.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.888
I'm worried about you.
Don't you understand?

35:42.014 --> 35:44.099
Understand what?
Please tell me.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.433
I said no. Bye.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.420
ArsehoIe! These were for you!

36:14.213 --> 36:17.132
Bastard! Go fuck yourseIf!

36:17.258 --> 36:19.342
I hate you! I hate you!

36:30.354 --> 36:33.106
- DarIing.
- You missed me, then.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.274
It's you.

36:34.400 --> 36:38.528
- Who did you think it was?
- Nobody. How are you?

36:38.654 --> 36:40.614
How are you?
You don't sound happy.

36:40.740 --> 36:45.785
No, it's just that I'm feeIing a bit IoneIy
with aII this space around me.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.997
I thought as much.
Do you fancy coming to a party?

36:49.123 --> 36:51.458
- A party?
- At my house.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.794
- I don't know. When?
- This evening.

36:54.921 --> 36:58.131
There are Iots of peopIe.
PIenty of ItaIians too.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.885
Well?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.971
AII right. Why not?

37:05.556 --> 37:07.432
Where do I go?

37:13.231 --> 37:16.191
OK. I'II get dressed
and come straight over.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.985
Make sure you don't put
too many cIothes on.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.780
See you soon. Bye.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.203
ArsehoIe!

41:47.796 --> 41:51.466
- You're here too.
- I wouIdn't miss the Judgment of Paris.

41:53.469 --> 41:57.222
- I wonder who wiII win this year.
- It depends on who Paris is.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.015
Someone said it's Moira.

41:59.141 --> 42:02.101
That's a reIief.
She understands these things.

42:03.437 --> 42:06.439
If there was a prize for the most use,
you'd definiteIy win.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.526
Why do we have to show our arses?

42:09.652 --> 42:12.820
Because the face can deceive
but the arse never Iies.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.365
Don't you know
it's the mirror of the souI?

42:21.080 --> 42:23.039
Why is it Iaughing?

42:23.165 --> 42:24.916
- What?
- That arse.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.918
It's got dimpIes in its cheeks.

42:27.044 --> 42:31.005
I think it's Iaughing at us.
It needs to be taught a Iesson.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.931
Yes, it needs to be punished.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.061
You ugIy arse-breaker.

42:45.187 --> 42:48.064
Yours is sad because
of aII the pricks that have fucked it.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.951
This is such fun.
I'm tempted to join in too.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.829
Oh, no.
That wouId be unfair, darIing.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.540
With your arse,
you'd win hands down.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.542
Cheers.

43:09.336 --> 43:13.381
- WiII you introduce your friend?
- Sure, darIing.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.592
CarIa, one of my cIients.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.429
Mario, my arsehoIe of an ex-husband.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.223
She says that
because she's stiII in Iove with me.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.310
- Are you ItaIian too?
- Yes, from Venice.

43:25.436 --> 43:29.606
So beautifuI.
I Iove Venice. EspeciaIIy the women.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.066
Watch out, CarIa.
Don't be deceived.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.861
Mario bewitches women
Iike snakes bewitch frogs.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.071
What?
You make me sound Iike a pIayboy.

43:37.197 --> 43:40.491
You're worse, darIing.
You're just a Latin Iover.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.662
Ignore her.
ShaII we dance?

43:44.788 --> 43:46.247
Yes, pIease.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.096
- Who drew that for you?
- Giotto.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.266
I couId bite that.

44:09.730 --> 44:13.941
Every year somebody tries to be cIever,
but with Moira as Paris...

44:24.995 --> 44:29.165
I've aIways wondered... Do you know
who designs the Queen's hats?

44:29.291 --> 44:31.501
He's got to be a dickhead.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.602
The scent of Venice.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.355
I Iike women who get wet straightaway.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.946
It's Iike champagne that's about to pop.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.449
Where's the bathroom?

45:46.118 --> 45:47.994
Over there, at the end.

47:32.182 --> 47:33.349
CarIa.

48:07.426 --> 48:10.344
Is it true that women
don't kiss you down here in EngIand?

48:11.930 --> 48:14.098
They do something eIse instead.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.433
What?

48:19.021 --> 48:21.856
- They take it up here.
- No. What are you doing?

48:29.114 --> 48:31.198
The path of the satyr.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.662
The road to Gomorrah
or the aIIey of Sodom.

49:56.076 --> 49:57.952
CarIa, are you in there?

50:05.627 --> 50:08.212
Open the door, CarIa.
I know you're in there.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.465
Just a minute.

50:20.434 --> 50:23.561
ExceIIent choice, my dear.
A reaI deIicacy.

50:33.488 --> 50:35.948
I invited you
because I'm in Iove with you,

50:36.074 --> 50:38.951
not so that you couId pIay the whore
with my ex-husband.

50:39.077 --> 50:40.453
I don't give a toss!

50:40.579 --> 50:44.123
I'm not interested in you. I Iike men.

50:44.249 --> 50:47.585
Can't you get that into
your stupid head? Men, not women!

50:47.711 --> 50:50.671
Men! I Iike dicks!

51:03.477 --> 51:04.935
CaIm down, CarIa.

51:07.939 --> 51:10.983
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

51:11.109 --> 51:13.402
You can teII me everything.
I'm your friend.

51:13.528 --> 51:17.656
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- That's got nothing to do with it.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.450
It's Matteo's fauIt.

51:19.576 --> 51:21.827
I don't understand him.

51:22.871 --> 51:25.498
I was so happy
when I caIIed him about the Ioft

51:25.624 --> 51:29.126
and then the stupid idiot said
he wasn't coming to London.

51:29.252 --> 51:31.921
He was coId and unfriendIy and nasty.

51:32.047 --> 51:35.299
He even sIammed the phone
down on me.

51:37.135 --> 51:38.803
Don't cry, darIing.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.639
I toId you, aII men are arsehoIes.

51:42.808 --> 51:44.391
But Matteo wasn't Iike that.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.644
Everything was going so weII
between us.

51:51.650 --> 51:55.361
Here. It's a token of my Iove.
It wiII bring you good Iuck.

52:01.076 --> 52:04.578
I don't understand.
Something must have happened.

52:05.831 --> 52:09.250
No, I understand compIeteIy
and I know how you're feeIing,

52:09.376 --> 52:11.043
because I've been there too.

52:11.169 --> 52:12.711
Never trust men.

52:12.838 --> 52:16.799
They're fickIe and untrustworthy.

52:16.925 --> 52:19.009
Listen to me, my darIing.

52:19.136 --> 52:23.222
Forget about Matteo. TeII him
to fuck off, Iike I did with Mario.

52:24.224 --> 52:26.100
Come with me.

52:26.893 --> 52:28.352
Come on.

54:03.907 --> 54:08.035
See, CarIa? We don't need men.
We do very weII without them.

54:24.386 --> 54:27.513
Painters, writers and architects
of worIdwide renown

54:27.639 --> 54:30.808
were aII attracted
by the Iure of the Doge's court.

54:30.934 --> 54:35.354
The profits from Venice's monopoIy
of the siIk and spice market

54:35.480 --> 54:39.233
were invested to adorn the city
with a pomp and spIendour that,

54:39.359 --> 54:41.819
according to the CounciI of Ten,

54:41.945 --> 54:45.823
wouId reflect the immense weaIth
produced by its trade.

54:45.949 --> 54:49.994
The government of La Serenissima
was focused Iess on conquering Iand

54:50.120 --> 54:52.913
and more on creating secure outposts

54:53.039 --> 54:55.332
in the commerciaI ports of the BaIkans

54:55.458 --> 54:58.585
so that they couId penetrate

54:58.712 --> 55:01.046
the rich siIk and spice markets
of the East more easiIy.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.925
We therefore have evidence
to substantiate our cIaim

55:05.051 --> 55:07.970
that the Venetian repubIic's
penetration

55:08.096 --> 55:10.806
into the markets
of the Mediterranean...

55:10.932 --> 55:14.435
Does the word "penetration"
derive from "penis"?

55:14.561 --> 55:17.646
Maybe from "prick".
Our teacher's prick.

55:23.194 --> 55:24.862
Look at that amazing arse.

55:24.988 --> 55:28.532
...and Venice's
poIiticaI and cuIturaI success.

55:28.658 --> 55:33.746
We can IegitimateIy say that
La Serenissima's mercantiIe penetration

55:33.872 --> 55:36.123
underpinned its artistic spIendour.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.959
Pietro Aretino, for instance...

55:39.085 --> 55:40.169
Whore!

55:48.011 --> 55:49.678
CuckoId!

57:29.154 --> 57:30.195
Matteo!

57:31.114 --> 57:32.823
Surprise!

57:33.741 --> 57:36.326
- What about your exam?
- I'II sit it in September.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.912
Do you aIways answer the door
dressed Iike that?

57:41.416 --> 57:44.001
Have you come here to fight?

57:44.127 --> 57:46.170
You don't seem very pIeased to see me.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.839
No, I'm reaIIy happy.

57:49.841 --> 57:52.217
It's just that I wasn't expecting you.

57:52.343 --> 57:55.304
Now that I'm here,
aren't you going to Iet me in,

57:55.430 --> 57:57.598
instead of keeping me here
on the doorstep?

57:57.724 --> 58:00.225
Sorry. Sure, come on in.

58:28.588 --> 58:30.672
Who is it at this time of the morning?

58:33.468 --> 58:35.844
Matteo, this is Moira.

58:39.015 --> 58:40.807
The estate agent?

58:43.436 --> 58:45.020
I'm Iate for work.

58:58.451 --> 59:01.620
Come and Iook out of the window.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.959
Look at the beautifuI view.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.254
BeautifuI.

59:11.798 --> 59:15.801
- I wonder how much it costs.
- Moira gave me a speciaI price.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.011
Sure, I can imagine.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.639
It's not what you think.

59:20.765 --> 59:23.433
Nothing's happened
between Moira and me.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.561
So what's she doing here?

59:25.687 --> 59:28.605
She gave me a Iift home Iast night.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.816
We'd been to the theatre.

59:30.942 --> 59:33.819
It was Iate so she stayed over.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.821
Naked?

59:35.947 --> 59:38.323
And in your bed?

59:46.708 --> 59:48.792
AII right, then. Bye, CarIa.

59:49.544 --> 59:52.462
Bye, Matteo.
It was nice to meet you.

59:52.589 --> 59:56.550
By the way,
CarIa's toId me a Iot about you.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.760
She's toId me a Iot about you too.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:11.690
Have you brought "The Interpretation
of Dreams" and my butterfly pants?

01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:15.360
I've brought you these.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:28.582
What's this stuff got to do with us?

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.793
It's got a Iot to do with us.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:36.381
Am I mistaken or is this your arse?

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:39.259
What the heII were you doing
on the beach naked?

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:42.721
- Who gave them to you?
- Don't worry about that.

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:47.601
You teII me what happened
between you and that French poof

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:50.687
who writes,
"Je t'aime, mon amour.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.065
"Je t'aime."

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.734
It's an oId reIationship.
Water under the bridge.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.985
BoIIocks!

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:01.990
If you want to stay with me, you need
to be honest and teII me everything.

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.992
There's nothing to say.

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:07.746
ReaIIy? Is it normaI for you
to have your photo taken naked?

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.708
It's not what you think.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:17.172
We went to Iook at the tourist faciIities
at the beach hoteIs on the Lido.

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.759
It was with the catering coIIege.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.054
You know what these trips are Iike.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.475
On the water buses, in the kitchens,
between the cabins.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.436
We'd mess around and strike poses.

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:35.857
We'd get our photos taken
and flirt for a Iaugh.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.153
Aftrr Iunch we'd go off
for waIks in groups.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:45.742
I ended up with Bernard
on the dunes on AIberoni beach.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.869
It was September.

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:51.832
It was hot and
there was nobody around.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:55.502
We took our cIothes off
and dived into the sea.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.796
- Naked?
- Of course.

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.507
We didn't have
any swimming costumes.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.509
Carry on.
Stick to the point.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:05.512
It was very warm for the time of year.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:09.099
The sea was caIm.
The sun was setting.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.768
The water was stiII and inviting.

01:04:57.768 --> 01:04:59.436
l love you, Carla.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.027
I fancy you.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.381
Look this way.

01:07:05.229 --> 01:07:06.688
And then?

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:09.524
And then nothing.
We got dressed.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:11.234
Are you taking the piss?

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.904
I mean it. Nothing eIse happened.
It was just an innocent bit of fun.

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:19.617
- When did it happen?
- I toId you. Last year.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.453
Towards the end of September.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:27.167
- So you were aIready with me?
- Yes, but we hadn't been together Iong.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.377
TeII me the truth.
Did you make Iove?

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:32.380
- No, Matteo, I swear.
- Don't swear.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:38.595
WeII, not reaIIy. Just a IittIe bit.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.805
What do you mean, a IittIe bit?

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:43.475
WeII, we flirted a bit.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.311
He was turned on and kissed me.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:49.355
Where? On your arse?

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:56.154
TeII me at Ieast how Iong
your innocent flirting Iasted.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.697
A coupIe of months.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:08:02.410
At Christmas, Bernard Ieft catering
coIIege and went back to France.

01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:03.995
Did you see each other again?

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:07.040
No. Never. I swear.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.042
I toId you not to swear.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:12.253
- Did you write to each other?
- For a IittIe whiIe.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:16.006
Just those Ietters you're hoIding.
He wanted me to go to Paris.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:19.594
- Why didn't you go?
- Because I'd faIIen in Iove with you.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.138
I wasn't interested in him any more.

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:28.478
- PIease, Matteo, stop tormenting me.
- The heII I wiII.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.397
How couId you have done it
when you were with me?

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:37.612
I toId you, it was right at the beginning.
I didn't know I'd faII in Iove with you.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:41.533
My reIationship with you
was just an affair Iike aII the others.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.743
PIease, Matteo.

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:54.295
Matteo, Iet's make Iove.

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.549
I want to feeI you inside me.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:00.510
What happened doesn't mean anything.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:04.764
The onIy thing that matters
is that I Iove you and I want you.

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:12.479
No, no. You're just a whore!
You did it with Bernard.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.490
What did you do with that bastard?

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:02.400
That's enough. It's pointIess.
You don't turn me on any more.

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:07.405
So I'm the Iiar, am I?

01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:19.584
I want to know. How many times
have you cheated on me?

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:23.087
It's your Iast chance
to be honest with me

01:12:23.213 --> 01:12:26.674
and convince me that our reIationship
wasn't a big mistake.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.177
How did your affair with Bernard start?

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.055
If you're ashamed to teII me to my face,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.725
write it in a Ietter
with aII the facts and detaiIs,

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.686
Iike the ones your Bernard wrote to you.

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.730
Don't worry about offending me.

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:43.900
Your Iies and your siIence
offend me much more.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.439
My darling Matteo,

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:27.110
betrayaI doesn't exist
without the illusion of closeness

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.238
due to one's own presumption
or another's deception.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:34.283
If you reaIIy need to know,
don't be afraid, I'II teII you everything.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.245
Do you remember
when we went to see

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.372
"The Key" at the Olympia cinema?

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.625
lt was the end of October
and Luca and Bernard were with us...

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:46.712
- SandreIIi's Iike our oenoIogy professor.
- She's beautifuI, though.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:50.216
Her husband's right when he says,
"Under that faIse modesty,

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:53.678
"you're more of a whore
than aII the whores I've ever met."

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.931
I don't understand him,
trying to get his wife to cheat on him.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.851
No, my friend,
without betrayaI there's no jeaIousy,

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:03.729
without jeaIousy there's no desire
and without desire there's no sex.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.065
- Isn't that right, CarIa?
- AbsoIuteIy.

01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:10.278
My dear Matteo,
betrayaI shouId be seen as a gift of Iove.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:14.282
It's the magic potion that wakes up
peopIe who've been asIeep for too Iong.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.664
Do me a favour.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.333
How can thinking about your woman
with another man turn you on?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.586
Where's CarIa?

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:29.797
CarIa!

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.687
You go that way.
We'II go this way.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:10.338
l was all wet.
Watching that fiIm had turned me on.

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:11.797
CarIa!

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.759
CarIa, jokes are onIy funny
if they don't Iast too Iong.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:18.054
Come on, CarIina.
TeII us where you are.

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:11.816
That's enough, CarIa.
What are you pIaying at?

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.062
NINA IS A WHORE

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:20.583
Hi, Nina.
You're stiII awake.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:26.881
It's the March scirocco wind.
I can't sIeep.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.426
TeII me about it!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.567
- Where's your husband?
- At the furnace.

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:49.695
He's on the night shift.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.198
It must be hot there.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.452
It's hot here too.
I'm soaking wet.

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:00.623
- FeeI.
- Yeah, you are.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.625
ReaIIy soaking.

01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:15.721
It's burning me.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:19.475
Touch me.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:23:00.140
- Nina, someone's there.
- Be quiet, you idiot.

01:23:00.266 --> 01:23:03.143
It's my husband.
He Iikes to watch.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.572
"The thought of you cheating on me
makes me mad with jeaIousy,

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.782
"and jeaIousy makes me
crazy with desire."

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:25.184
Yes, darIing, I'II come straightaway.

01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:39.174
You were right.
What happened doesn't matter.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.385
What matters is that
I'm crazy about you.

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.929
Matteo, I'm crazy about you too.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.225
Look. I did what you wanted.

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:00.028
I don't need it now.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.488
Oh, darIing.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:04.700
Suspicion is better than the truth,
aftrr aII.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:09.329
Your Iies reveaI your desire
more than any confession couId.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.416
Promise that you'II aIways Iie to me.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.626
Yes, of course.
Whatever you want.

01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:17.462
AIthough I don't understand why.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:21.550
I Iied to you before,
because I didn't want to Iose you.

01:26:22.468 --> 01:26:24.720
But why shouId I do it now?

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:27.514
Because suspicion makes me
mad with jeaIousy,

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.434
and jeaIousy makes me
fuII of desire for you.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.020
Oh, Matteo, I Iove you.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.063
Oh, darIing.

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:39.109
I swear I'II aIways Iie to you.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:51.413
You're such a whore.
