WEBVTT

00:22.823 --> 00:24.558
GORGEOUS. HOLD IT.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.293
-LOVE IT.

00:28.262 --> 00:32.133
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.568
-I'M LOVING THIS.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.769
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
WE GOT THE SHOT.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.171
-GOT IT?
-YEAH.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.373
GREAT!
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:39.407 --> 00:43.211
OH, MISS WYATT,
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE HAD
A LITTLE CHAT NOW?

00:43.244 --> 00:46.647
SURE. ALMOST FORGOT.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.218
SO, PANEL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THIS MEDIA FRENZY?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.253
I THINK
IT'S A COMPLETE OUTRAGE.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.688
THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO
ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD

00:54.722 --> 00:57.525
AND TALK ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE HER.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.859
SHE'S AMERICA'S "IT" GIRL,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.395
BUT SHE ABUSES THE SYSTEM
AND LIES,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.231
AND REAL VICTIMS WILL BE
WATCHING HER THINKING,

01:03.264 --> 01:05.433
"NOW NO ONE
WILL BELIEVE ME."

01:05.465 --> 01:08.402
WELL, I ALSO THINK
THAT WE SHOULD GET A MALE
PERSPECTIVE IN ON THIS,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.738
BECAUSE THIS IS
A MASSIVE PROBLEM.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.507
WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO SAY
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

01:13.541 --> 01:15.776
AND THEN RUIN A MAN'S CAREER
AND HIS REPUTATION.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.445
OH, COME ON,
HE'LL BE FINE.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.247
HE'S GONNA MAKE A BUNCH
OF MONEY OFF OF THIS.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.849
LET'S JUST BRING IT BACK
TO MIMI FOR A MOMENT.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.218
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T ASK
FOR THIS.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.187
WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY GOT IT.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.423
AND MIMI'S NOT GOING TO DO
TOO BAD FROM THIS EITHER.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.592
NO SUCH THING
AS BAD PUBLICITY.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.261
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.663
SHE CAN NEVER
WORK AGAIN AFTER THIS.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.566
SHE'S JUST A KISS AND TELL,
FAME HUNGRY NOBODY.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.202
WOW, THE CLAWS ARE REALLY
OUT TODAY, SOPHIA.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.171
SHE WOULD SELL
HER OWN MOTHER FOR A STORY.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.905
I THINK THAT
THAT'S A BIT FAR.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.141
I'M WITH YOU, HON.
WITHOUT A STORY,

01:47.175 --> 01:49.177
WHO IS SHE?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.588
SO, MIMI--
CAN I CALL YOU MIMI?

02:00.621 --> 02:03.391
TELL ME,
HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

02:03.424 --> 02:05.326
MAN: HEY, MIMI,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TODAY.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.628
HOW'S BRANNING?
ARE YOU GONNA SEE
BRANNING LATER?

02:07.661 --> 02:10.830
-YOU MAKE A CUTE COUPLE!
-MIMI!

02:10.864 --> 02:13.934
* LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS

02:13.967 --> 02:17.205
* EVER SINCE WE WERE 17

02:17.238 --> 02:18.772
* YOU KNOW THE TRUTH
CAN BE A WEAPON *

02:18.806 --> 02:19.873
HEY, PHIL,
I JUST LEFT THE SHOOT

02:19.907 --> 02:21.475
AND I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.477
I CAN'T KEEP DOING
THESE SAME SHIT JOBS.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.945
I'M NOT GONNA
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.447
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
ABOUT THE VMAs.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.616
YOU HAD ONE JOB.
WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.418
* YOU LEARN THE SAME LESSON

02:32.386 --> 02:35.623
* THEY GOT IT ALL WRONG

02:35.656 --> 02:38.626
* YOU JUST GOTTA HOLD ON

02:38.659 --> 02:42.630
* AND ON AND ON AND ON

02:42.663 --> 02:45.899
* 'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA BE LEGENDS *

02:45.933 --> 02:49.303
* GONNA GET THEIR ATTENTION

02:51.004 --> 02:52.540
HEY, THIS IS MIMI.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.941
SORRY I CAN'T GET
TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.944
LEAVE ME A MESSAGE
AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.248
HEY, IT'S ME.
SORRY, I'VE BEEN RUNNING
AROUND LIKE CRAZY.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.650
LISTEN, I JUST WANTED
TO GET BACK TO YOU
REGARDING THE VMAs.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.952
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY PASSED
ON YOU THIS YEAR.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.388
AFTER YOUR DATE DIDN'T
SHOW UP LAST YEAR

03:07.421 --> 03:08.822
AND THEY WERE KIND OF
COUNTING ON IT,

03:08.856 --> 03:11.292
THEY SAID NO.
NOW DON'T BE UPSET.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.794
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA START
TEXTING ME AND GET ALL MAD.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.629
WE CAN WORK ON THIS
FOR NEXT YEAR.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.965
YOU'LL BE BACK ON THAT CARPET,
I PROMISE YOU.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.601
BUT FOR NOW, YOU'VE GOTTA
GET OUT THERE MORE.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.403
RIGHT NOW YOUR BRAND
JUST ISN'T WORKING.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.837
YOU NEED, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT OF A SCANDAL.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
YOU GOTTA STAY
IN THE PUBLIC EYE.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.375
PLAY THE GAME,
I KEEP TELLING YOU.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.377
ON ANOTHER NOTE,
I'M TALKING TO THIS GUY
NEXT WEEK

03:29.410 --> 03:31.512
AND HE'S TALKING TO ME
ABOUT A REALITY SHOW FOR YOU

03:31.545 --> 03:34.415
WHICH I THINK
WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.684
BUT LISTEN, PLEASE SHOW UP
TONIGHT TO SANTOS.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.519
BE ON TIME,
BE PROFESSIONAL.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.654
JUST-- IT'S VERY EASY.
IT'S EASY WORK.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.356
ANYWAY, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.392
KISSES. BYE.

03:46.294 --> 03:50.398
* AND ON AND ON AND ON

03:50.431 --> 03:53.701
* 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA
BE LEGENDS *

03:53.734 --> 03:57.438
* GONNA GET
THEIR ATTENTION *

03:57.471 --> 04:00.574
* WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE
AIN'T JUST SCARY *

04:00.608 --> 04:03.711
* IT'S ABOUT
TO BE LEGENDARY *

04:03.744 --> 04:07.047
* YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
BE LEGENDS *

04:07.080 --> 04:10.584
* GONNA TEACH 'EM
ALL A LESSON *

04:10.618 --> 04:13.887
* GOT THIS FEELING
IN OUR SOULS WE CARRY *

04:13.921 --> 04:18.726
* IT'S ABOUT
TO BE LEGENDARY *

04:18.759 --> 04:22.363
* EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GONNA
KNOW WHO'S RIGHT *

04:22.396 --> 04:25.599
* TO MAKE A STAND,
YOU'VE GOTTA WIN THE FIGHT *

04:25.633 --> 04:29.437
* CAN'T STAND THE HEAT,
THEN JUST STAY OUT THE LIGHT *

04:29.470 --> 04:32.440
* BUT YOU MIGHT NEVER
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE *

04:32.473 --> 04:35.743
* YOU GOTTA LIVE
WITHOUT A COMPROMISE *

04:35.776 --> 04:40.748
* LET EVERYBODY HEAR
YOUR BATTLE CRY *

04:40.781 --> 04:41.882
* YEAH

05:12.813 --> 05:17.017
-IT'S MIMI WYATT!

05:22.089 --> 05:24.358
OH, MY GOSH,
MIMI, I LOVE YOU.

05:24.392 --> 05:27.127
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL,
ALL RIGHT.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.802
HEY! WAIT, WAIT!
ONE MORE! ONE MORE!

05:34.835 --> 05:35.869
COME ON, MIMI!

05:37.705 --> 05:39.873
MIMI, I'M JACK.
I OWN THIS PLACE.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.109
-YOUR AGENT TOLD ME 11:00.
-WELL, I'M HERE NOW.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.811
WELL, FOLLOW ME.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.761
PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU.
I'LL PUT YOU ON IN A SECOND.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.134
HEY, GUYS.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.739
-HEY!

07:09.797 --> 07:13.534
MIMI? ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?
WHAT THE--

07:13.567 --> 07:16.169
FUCKING PHOTOGRAPHERS
ALWAYS GETTING IN
THE FUCKING WAY.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.639
CAN'T A GIRL HAVE SOME FUCKING
PRIVACY OVER HERE, PLEASE?

07:18.672 --> 07:19.907
-OKAY, BACK UP.
-GET A FUCKING LIFE.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.808
PLEASE BACK UP.

07:23.110 --> 07:27.515
MOVE. YOU KNOW
THE ADDRESS, RIGHT?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.917
ALL RIGHT, MOVE.
PLEASE BACK UP.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.019
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.117
* I'VE BEEN TRIED

08:04.151 --> 08:06.787
* AND YOU KNOW
I'VE BEEN TESTED *

08:09.723 --> 08:12.125
* BUT I WON'T BACK DOWN

08:12.159 --> 08:14.194
* NO, I'LL NEVER SURRENDER

08:18.699 --> 08:22.670
* I'VE SEEN THE PROOF,
I KNOW THE TRUTH *

08:22.703 --> 08:26.173
* THIS IS WHAT
I WAS MADE TO DO *

08:26.206 --> 08:30.010
* I WAS BORN

08:30.043 --> 08:31.211
* TO THIS

08:34.181 --> 08:38.150
* I WAS BORN

08:38.184 --> 08:39.587
* TO THIS

08:50.664 --> 08:54.067
* I GET BIT,
AND I MIGHT START BLEEDING *

08:58.205 --> 09:02.075
* BUT I'M NOT ON THE FLOOR
STARING AT THE CEILING *

09:07.047 --> 09:10.183
* I'll GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN *

09:10.217 --> 09:11.919
* 'BOUT TO SHOW YOU NOW

09:11.952 --> 09:14.187
* THAT IT'S MORE
THAN JUST A FEELING *

09:14.221 --> 09:15.956
* I WAS BORN

09:18.058 --> 09:19.627
* FOR THIS

09:21.394 --> 09:23.263
* BABY, I WAS BORN

09:26.066 --> 09:27.635
* FOR THIS

09:52.793 --> 09:53.694
SHIT.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.831
WAIT!

09:57.865 --> 09:59.967
HELLO?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.637
HELLO?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.676
OH, MY GOD.

10:16.717 --> 10:20.153
HELP! HELP!

10:20.187 --> 10:21.154
HELP!

10:46.146 --> 10:47.280
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.783
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE PERPETRATOR?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.819
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.120
HOW MANY MORE TIMES
DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ME?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.722
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.389
LISTEN, WE JUST NEED
TO KNOW ALL THE FACTS,

10:56.423 --> 10:58.091
SO WE CAN NAIL THIS GUY.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.327
YOU COULD BE GOING OUT
AND FINDING HIM RIGHT NOW.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.830
JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS,
MISS WYATT.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.833
HOW DID HE KEEP YOU UNDER
HIS CONTROL FOR THREE DAYS?

11:08.035 --> 11:11.371
HE HAD ME LOCKED UP
IN HIS BASEMENT.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.241
AND DID HE SEXUALLY ASSAULT
YOU IN ANY WAY?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.124
GET ME OUT.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.762
SOMEBODY, GET ME OUT!

11:49.509 --> 11:51.812
LET ME GO.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.413
PLEASE, I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.248
PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.088
NO.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.131
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.043
HE WAS FUCKING CRAZY.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.377
OKAY, SO HOW
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.213
WAS HE TALL? WAS HE SHORT?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.916
TALLISH.
KIND OF YOUR HEIGHT.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.952
HE HAD DARK HAIR,
BROWN EYES.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.486
AND DID HE HAVE ANY OTHER
DISTINCTIVE MARKINGS?

12:33.520 --> 12:37.991
ANY TATTOOS,
PIERCINGS, SCARS?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.961
HE WAS JUST
YOUR REGULAR GUY.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.931
OKAY, MISS WYATT, I KNOW THIS
IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.867
BUT THE SOONER WE ACT,
THE BETTER CHANCE WE HAVE
OF CATCHING THIS GUY

12:46.900 --> 12:48.802
AND GETTING HIM LOCKED UP.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.939
I WILL NEED YOU TO TAKE
A MEDICAL EXAMINATION.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.075
HELLO?

13:01.949 --> 13:05.418
HELP! HELP!

13:13.526 --> 13:15.228
NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.266
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO TO ME?

13:19.299 --> 13:22.469
DO AS I SAY
AND YOU WON'T GET HURT.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.573
I NEED MONEY.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.509
$123,000, TO BE PRECISE.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.013
AS SOON AS SOMEONE
TRANSFERS ME THE MONEY,

13:33.046 --> 13:35.215
I WILL LET YOU GO.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.950
I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND
OF MONEY AVAILABLE.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.987
BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.821
MAYBE ONE OF
YOUR FUCK BUDDIES.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.292
I CAN GET IT.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.060
HOW SOON CAN YOU
GET IT TO ME?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.062
IT'S A LOT OF CASH.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.131
WELL, THINK.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.000
WHEN I GET THE MONEY,
YOU CAN GO.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.070
WELL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.638
I DON'T HAVE THAT
IN MY ACCOUNT.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.207
DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO CALL SOMEONE?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.239
I WASN'T GOING TO--

14:34.474 --> 14:36.977
YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

14:37.010 --> 14:40.948
YOU WANT TO GO HOME?
THEN GET THE MONEY TOGETHER.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.349
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.516
WELL, YOU'D BETTER KNOW
SOMEONE WHO DOES.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.352
I CAN GET IT.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.587
GOOD. WHO DO I CALL?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.623
MY MANAGER.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.530
IT'S 1654.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.200
HE'S UNDER PHIL C.,
MY CONTACTS.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.536
GOOD.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.345
HERE. THIS SHOULD
MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE
WHILE YOU'RE DOWN HERE.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.584
WELL, WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BACK?

15:19.152 --> 15:24.257
SO THE RANSOM WAS
FOR $123,000 EXACTLY.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.060
HOW WERE YOU
GONNA ARRANGE THAT?

15:27.094 --> 15:31.498
UM, HE HAD AN IDEA

15:31.531 --> 15:34.001
WE COULD GET
AN ADVANCE PAYMENT

15:34.034 --> 15:38.138
FOR MY FORTHCOMING BOOKINGS
FOR MY APPEARANCES.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.474
AND HOW WOULD HE GO ABOUT
DOING THAT?

15:41.508 --> 15:44.244
I GAVE HIM MY AGENT'S NUMBER.
HE WOULD DO IT.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.716
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.551
TO PROVE YOU'RE ALIVE.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.526
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
AFTER 24 HOURS?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.061
WHAT IF HE CAN'T
GET THE MONEY?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.698
LET'S HOPE
IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.002
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY.

16:09.036 --> 16:12.605
DON'T TRY TO GET INVOLVED
IN THINGS YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.642
IT'S A LOT OF CASH
TO GET QUICKLY.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.677
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.112
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SO.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.614
IT'S NOT
A LOT OF MONEY FOR YOU.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.152
I'M NOT AS WEALTHY
AS YOU THINK.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.786
YOU WANT ME
TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOU?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.456
NO, I'M JUST WARNING YOU

16:29.489 --> 16:31.524
THAT IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.193
HOW LONG
ARE YOU TALKING HERE?

16:33.226 --> 16:35.428
A DAY, TWO DAYS?
A WEEK?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.715
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

17:02.522 --> 17:06.193
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
-YOU WASTED MY TIME.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.728
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.498
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE QUICK AND EASY.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.599
I THINK I CAN GET IT.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.137
WELL, THINK FAST.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.306
I CAN GET YOU SOME CASH.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.143
IF YOU LET ME GO,
I CAN SORT IT.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.844
YOU THINK I'M STUPID.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.815
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
AS YOU THINK.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.518
MAYBE I COULD GET YOU 80?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.820
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.789
THE FULL AMOUNT
OR YOU STAY HERE.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.762
JUST DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO ME.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.531
GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.532
GO ON.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.503
I WON'T EVEN PUT UP A FIGHT.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.776
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.779
YOU COULDN'T BEGIN
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT--

17:59.812 --> 18:02.882
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.185
JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
THE MONEY TOGETHER.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.220
YOU CAN GO RIGHT BACK TO
YOUR GUCCI FUCKING HANDBAGS.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.222
DON'T YOU DARE
FUCKING JUDGE ME.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.857
YOU THINK I HAVE IT SO EASY?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.226
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD MY LIFE IS.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.827
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE SHIT
THAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.664
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

19:07.880 --> 19:12.952
EXCUSE ME? HELLO?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.322
I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.928
I HAVE TO GO.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.337
PLEASE?

19:34.441 --> 19:37.244
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.545
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.309
-NO.
-WHAT?

20:09.342 --> 20:10.743
I CAN'T RISK IT.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.866
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GO.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.735
YEAH, I DO.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.305
LOOK, I CAN'T GO IF
YOU'RE STANDING OUTSIDE.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.940
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
A MINUTE?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.575
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.398
HELLO? HEY, WHAT'S UP?

21:05.432 --> 21:06.899
I'M WORKING ON IT.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.901
I'M DOING THE BEST
I CAN, OKAY?

21:08.935 --> 21:12.472
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.408
LOOK, I'LL GET IT.
I'LL TRANSFER SOME MORE
OVER TONIGHT.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.913
IS SHE LISTENING TO THIS?

21:20.947 --> 21:24.884
RACHEL, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF HER.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.355
YES, SHE DOES.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.789
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.429
I'M DONE.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.505
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?
WHAT DID PHIL SAY?

21:45.538 --> 21:47.073
HE'S GONNA SEE
WHAT HE CAN DO.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.116
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.118
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.389
-IT IS.
-DON'T CONCERN YOURSELF.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.491
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS I NEED THE MONEY.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.493
IF YOU EXPLAIN TO ME,
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.060
I DON'T NEED HELP.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.796
I NEED CASH.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.980
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

22:31.017 --> 22:32.919
GET THAT THING
AWAY FROM ME!

22:36.122 --> 22:37.857
I WANT TO GO HOME.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.062
CAN'T ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.534
I'LL HELP YOU
GET THE MONEY.

22:47.567 --> 22:51.504
I WON'T PRESS ANY CHARGES.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.540
LET ME MAKE YOUR STAY HERE
MORE COMFORTABLE.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.174
I'LL GET YOU
SOME MORE BLANKETS.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.009
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE
FUCKING BEDDING!

22:57.043 --> 22:59.045
I WANT TO GO HOME!

23:18.064 --> 23:21.568
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.202
IF YOU'RE IN
A DIFFICULT SITUATION,

23:23.235 --> 23:25.171
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.040
TALK TO ME.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.108
I COULD HELP YOU.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.746
I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.616
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.084
YOU WANT TO TALK
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL

23:38.117 --> 23:39.752
SO I CAN SEE YOU AS A PERSON

23:39.786 --> 23:44.056
AND THEN WE FROM SOME SORT
OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.526
BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.161
YOU ARE NOTHING MORE TO ME

23:49.195 --> 23:52.732
THAN THE TICKET
TO SOLVING MY PROBLEMS.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.972
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY PATIENCE.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.875
LET'S KEEP THIS SIMPLE.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.603
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.682
I SWEAR, WHEN THIS IS OVER

25:15.715 --> 25:16.983
YOU'LL NEVER SEE
MY FACE AGAIN.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.821
I WANT TO GO HOME.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.124
I'M NOT MEANT TO BE HERE.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.661
THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.269
LOOK, IT'S GETTING LATE.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.173
I CAN HEAT UP SOME SOUP

25:41.207 --> 25:43.009
OR YOU CAN PUT
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.110
I DON'T COOK.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.851
OKAY, GUESS
WE HEAD UPSTAIRS NOW.

25:51.884 --> 25:56.723
-BUT I NEED YOU TO...
-I KNOW.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.960
ALL RIGHT.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.581
AM I ALLOWED
TO KNOW YOUR NAME?

26:24.383 --> 26:27.186
IT'S FRANK.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.855
THIS WAY.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.199
THERE'S SOME EGGS AND BACON
IN THE FRIDGE.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.972
AN OMELET?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.618
CAN I HELP WITH ANYTHING?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.022
IT'S OKAY.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.776
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?

27:25.311 --> 27:29.048
FROM THE AGENT?
NO, NOT YET.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.455
WHY $123,000?

27:36.488 --> 27:39.291
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I NEED.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.327
ANYTHING OVER THAT,
YOU CAN KEEP.

27:43.730 --> 27:46.098
WELL, I WON'T NEED IT.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.704
DO YOU HAVE A WHISK?

27:52.905 --> 27:53.940
THE DRAWER TO YOUR RIGHT.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.326
THAT'S A NICE PHOTO.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.462
I'M SURE YOU KNOW
A LOT ABOUT NICE PHOTOS.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.464
LOOK.

29:28.067 --> 29:32.571
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN SLEEP
IN MY ROOM TONIGHT.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.943
I'LL STAY ON THE COUCH.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.545
YOU'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.981
THANKS.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.083
I'M GONNA GO GET
THE BEDDING.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.210
FUCK!

30:11.243 --> 30:13.412
AND YOU NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE?

30:13.445 --> 30:14.546
NO.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.449
HE KEPT ME LOCKED UP.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.518
I TRIED TO RUN AWAY.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.254
YOU TRIED TO RUN AWAY,
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?

30:23.622 --> 30:26.959
I WASN'T FAST ENOUGH.

30:26.993 --> 30:30.062
I WAS SO SCARED.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.431
IT'S OKAY, MIMI.
JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.469
SARGE, I NEED A WORD.
SORRY, IT'S URGENT.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.413
PLEASE! SAVE ME!
PLEASE HELP ME!

30:47.446 --> 30:49.115
-HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?
-PLEASE HELP ME!

30:49.148 --> 30:50.649
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT YOU.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.617
I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED!
THERE'S A MAN--

30:51.650 --> 30:53.485
OKAY! CALM DOWN!

30:53.519 --> 30:55.187
-I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU.
-CAN YOU CALL THE COPS?

30:55.221 --> 30:58.024
-HE HAS MY PHONE, PLEASE.
-SHH. WAIT A MINUTE.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.926
DO I KNOW YOU?
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

30:59.959 --> 31:04.897
-MY NAME IS MIMI WYATT.
-MIMI WYATT? NO WAY!

31:04.931 --> 31:08.200
WHAT IS A PRETTY GIRL
DOING OUT ON HER OWN
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

31:08.234 --> 31:10.202
THERE ARE
SOME BAD PEOPLE AROUND.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.338
-GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
-I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.673
-GET OFF ME, GET OFF ME!
-HEY, DON'T-- DON'T--

31:14.706 --> 31:18.344
DON'T SCREAM.
DON'T SCREAM.

31:18.377 --> 31:22.648
OH, WHAT THE FUCK?
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP!

31:22.681 --> 31:25.351
GAH! YOU LITTLE BITCH!

31:29.555 --> 31:31.157
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.347
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

31:55.381 --> 31:56.548
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
WE HAD A DEAL!

31:56.582 --> 31:57.984
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!

32:00.987 --> 32:03.389
LET ME HELP YOU UP.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.524
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.526
SORRY.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.295
COME ON.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.357
HERE.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.562
-GET SOME REST.
-ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

33:19.598 --> 33:21.133
OF COURSE NOT.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.438
MIMI, I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.309
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M DOING THIS.

33:30.342 --> 33:34.012
BUT I CAN'T KEEP YOU SAFE
IF YOU RUN AWAY.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.152
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.295
-WHAT'S UP?
-PRESS IS OUTSIDE.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.064
THEY WANT A STATEMENT.
WE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS FAST.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.732
ABSOLUTELY NO STATEMENTS
WHATSOEVER.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.501
-WHO TIPPED THEM OFF
ABOUT HER?
-I DON'T KNOW.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.502
COULD HAVE BEEN
ANY ONE OF THE GUYS.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.569
MAYBE EVEN THE DRIVER.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.671
SHIT.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.184
-MIMI, ARE YOU UP?

35:38.704 --> 35:39.905
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, MIMI.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.609
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A SHOWER.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.414
IT'S SIMPLE.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.682
METAL KNOB IS
FOR WATER PRESSURE,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.651
LEFT AND RIGHT
ARE TEMPERATURE.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.620
-I GOT IT.
-OKAY. I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.763
-DID YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID?
-ABOUT WHAT?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.531
THE MONEY.

36:39.565 --> 36:44.002
YEAH. ANYTHING OVER
WHAT I NEED IS YOURS.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.638
BUT YOU HAVE TO COOPERATE.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.292
PHIL, DID YOU GET THE MONEY?

37:10.896 --> 37:14.533
YOU'VE HAD 24 HOURS.
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:17.068 --> 37:20.406
WHAT? THAT'S BULLSHIT!

37:20.439 --> 37:23.575
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DONE BY NOW! FUCK!

37:23.609 --> 37:25.611
-FUCK! FUCK!
-HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:25.644 --> 37:28.380
IT ISN'T WORKING.
HE CAN'T GET THE MONEY!

37:41.760 --> 37:44.896
I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.368
I GET IT.

37:49.401 --> 37:54.540
IT'S TOTALLY WRONG
AND COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.813
I HAVE AN IDEA.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.652
-COME IN.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.089
YES, MISS THOMAS?

38:11.122 --> 38:12.624
I'VE USED UP ALL MY FAVORS
FOR THE YEAR

38:12.658 --> 38:14.926
AND RENTED OUT THIS BODY
TILL THE YEAR 2020,

38:14.960 --> 38:17.829
SO YOU OWE ME BIG TIME.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.765
I BELIEVE THIS IS
WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.939
WHERE'S MISS WYATT NOW?

38:27.973 --> 38:31.009
SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE STAFF ROOM
RESTING WITH DETECTIVE HAYES.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.879
IT'S LIKE A ZOO UP THERE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY GUYS

38:33.912 --> 38:35.981
WANTING TO VOLUNTEER
AFTER SHIFT.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.683
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.719
AND PUT BACK THE PRESS
FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.391
COPY THAT.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.642
SO HOW MUCH CAN YOU ACTUALLY
GET FROM THESE INTERVIEWS?

39:03.675 --> 39:07.045
I GOT $30,000 FOR AN EXCLUSIVE
"AFTER THE LOVE HOUSE" SHOW.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.114
65 FOR MY INTERVIEW
ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH BRANNING.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.982
BUT THIS IS BIGGER.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.419
WE'RE LOOKING
AT NO LESS THAN 150.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.621
SO WE NEED TO GET PHIL
TO SELL THE EXCLUSIVE STORY

39:15.654 --> 39:18.056
-TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
-YOU CAN GET THAT MUCH?

39:18.089 --> 39:20.792
I KNOW A GIRL
WHO GOT NEARLY 200,000

39:20.826 --> 39:24.696
BECAUSE SHE HAD
PHOTOS OF HER ON A DATE
WITH A MARRIED SENATOR.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.098
IF YOU THINK IT CAN WORK,
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.936
SO, HOW OLD IS SHE?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.806
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.177
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.580
-AND IT MIGHT HELP.
-IT CHANGES NOTHING.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.783
I DON'T LIKE--
I DON'T LIKE TALKING
ABOUT HER BEING ILL.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.921
SORRY.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.994
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE A PHOTO OF HER?

40:08.474 --> 40:09.541
THERE ARE STILL OPTIONS?

40:11.076 --> 40:12.077
IF WE COULD AFFORD THEM.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.979
EVEROLIMUS COULD WORK,

40:14.012 --> 40:16.615
AND THERE ARE SOME
NEW UNTRIED DRUGS,

40:16.648 --> 40:18.750
BUT OUR INSURANCE
WON'T COVER.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.019
AND WHAT CHANCE
WILL THAT GIVE HER?

40:21.052 --> 40:25.056
50-50. 60-40 MAYBE.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.594
-WHAT ABOUT YOU?
-ME?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.696
I'M GONNA BE LOCKED UP
FOR A LONG TIME.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.101
I NEVER WANTED TO GET YOU
INVOLVED IN ALL THIS.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.470
IT WASN'T PLANNED.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.205
YOU GOT INTO MY CAB
THAT NIGHT AND PASSED OUT,

40:40.238 --> 40:44.676
AND I JUST FOUND MYSELF
DRIVING HERE

40:44.710 --> 40:46.044
BEFORE I KNEW IT.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.079
BUT HOW WILL YOU
SEE HER AGAIN?

40:51.082 --> 40:51.783
I WON'T.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.487
EVER.

40:59.024 --> 41:02.761
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE
LOVING ME THAT MUCH.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.964
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

41:07.733 --> 41:10.602
-WHAT?
-YOU HAVE A REPUTATION

41:10.636 --> 41:12.638
THAT WOULD BOTHER
MOST PEOPLE.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.707
MY REPUTATION?
THAT'S ALL LIES.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.710
MAYBE SO,
BUT THE CAMERA NEVER LIES.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.712
PICTURE'S WORTH
A THOUSAND WORDS.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.515
-THEY'RE JUST PHOTOS.
-THEY'RE NOT JUST PHOTOS.

41:23.549 --> 41:26.652
THEY'RE ADVERTS FOR
THE GOODS YOU'RE SELLING.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.953
-THEY'RE ART--
-ARTISTIC.

41:30.589 --> 41:35.827
MAYBE. BUT YOU REALLY
ARE A STUNNING GIRL.

41:35.861 --> 41:39.598
YOU SHOULDN'T SELL
YOURSELF SHORT LIKE THAT.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.900
AFTER THIS,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.537
HOPEFULLY WE'LL HEAR
FROM PHIL BY THE MORNING.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.008
IS THAT MY BREAKFAST?

43:30.041 --> 43:33.611
I GUESS THAT DEPENDS
ON HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE.

43:35.847 --> 43:36.882
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
ON YOUR WAFFLES?

43:38.817 --> 43:40.886
HONEY.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.990
CAN I HELP WITH ANYTHING?

43:45.023 --> 43:48.226
YEAH, THERE'S SOME
FORKS AND KNIVES
OVER IN THAT CABINET.

43:49.761 --> 43:51.029
SURE.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.389
YEAH, IT'S
A PRETTY GOOD READ.

44:21.292 --> 44:23.929
HE'S A LUCKY GUY.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.697
I DIDN'T THINK
THEY'D PRINT THIS.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.400
WHAT'S WRONG?

44:29.434 --> 44:33.471
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE ABOUT... YOU KNOW.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.473
OH, YEAH.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.209
I'M SURE BY THE TIME
YOUR AGENT GOT TO EVERYBODY

44:38.243 --> 44:39.911
IT WAS TOO LATE TO PRINT.

44:39.945 --> 44:43.048
WHY WOULD THEY RUN THIS?

44:43.081 --> 44:45.283
YOU GAVE THEM
THE INTERVIEW, RIGHT?

44:45.316 --> 44:47.719
YEAH.

44:47.753 --> 44:51.222
SO... GUESS THEY NEEDED
TO GET THEIR MONEY'S WORTH.

44:57.963 --> 45:00.732
HERE.
LET'S THROW THIS AWAY.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.409
THE FORECAST, PLENTY OF
SUNSHINE THROUGH TODAY...

45:44.442 --> 45:47.078
WOW.

45:47.112 --> 45:49.214
GOD, MY CLOTHES
NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.055
SO I SPOKE TO PHIL.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.957
HE SAID IT'S
A BIDDING WAR OUT THERE.

45:58.990 --> 46:01.092
EVERY MAGAZINE
WANTS THE RIGHTS.

46:01.126 --> 46:03.795
-REALLY?
-THEY NEED TO FINALIZE
THE DETAILS,

46:03.829 --> 46:06.531
SO IT COULD TAKE
A BIT LONGER.

46:06.564 --> 46:10.201
SO WHAT DO WE DO
UNTIL THEN?

46:22.013 --> 46:24.015
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.

46:24.049 --> 46:26.051
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THE RULES ARE SO SIMPLE.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.586
-HOW DO YOU NOT GET IT YET?
-YOU'RE TOTALLY CHEATING.

46:28.619 --> 46:31.890
OKAY, YOU CAN GO
FIRST NEXT ROUND,

46:31.923 --> 46:33.591
IF THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.461
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.496
-YOU FEELING LUCKY?
-SURE AM.

46:38.529 --> 46:39.898
ONE...

46:39.931 --> 46:41.900
TWO, THREE.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.275
UM...

46:53.044 --> 46:55.847
SO WHY ISN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND
COMING FORWARD TO PAY?

46:57.482 --> 46:59.084
TOO BUSY WITH HIS WIFE?

47:00.986 --> 47:03.154
I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

47:05.556 --> 47:07.926
AND WHAT ABOUT BRANNING?

47:07.959 --> 47:09.360
I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE.

47:11.096 --> 47:13.064
REALLY?
I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT--

47:13.098 --> 47:14.866
WELL, FORGET
WHAT YOU'VE READ.

47:14.900 --> 47:18.136
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.

47:18.169 --> 47:19.637
THE PRESS PUT ME WITH
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GUYS,

47:19.670 --> 47:22.407
AND IT'S NOT TRUE.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.910
WHY DO YOU LET 'EM
GET AWAY WITH IT?

47:26.611 --> 47:29.114
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

47:29.147 --> 47:31.983
PEOPLE CAN THINK
WHAT THEY WANT.

47:32.017 --> 47:35.020
YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

47:35.053 --> 47:36.922
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

47:36.955 --> 47:39.024
WELL, I DON'T.

47:39.057 --> 47:42.293
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.963
YOU DON'T CONFIRM IT,
BUT YOU DON'T DENY IT, EITHER.

47:46.597 --> 47:50.568
-WHY?
-TO GET PEOPLE TALKING,

47:50.601 --> 47:54.239
SO YOU'RE THE ONE
INVITED TO THE RIGHT PLACES.

47:54.272 --> 47:57.275
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW,
IT'S WHO YOU KNOW.

48:00.946 --> 48:02.480
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IN WHAT WAY?

48:02.513 --> 48:06.051
WELL, THE MORE
I'M OUT THERE,

48:06.084 --> 48:09.387
THE MORE LIKELY I GET TO DO
WHAT I WANT TO DO,

48:09.420 --> 48:11.923
WHICH IS ACT.

48:11.957 --> 48:14.425
OH, YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

48:14.459 --> 48:16.327
WELL, HOPEFULLY ONE DAY.

48:19.497 --> 48:21.632
I WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO HAVE MADE MY NAME
ANOTHER WAY,

48:21.666 --> 48:24.936
BUT I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

48:24.970 --> 48:26.604
I'M PLAYING THE CARDS
I WAS DEALT.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.449
I'M GONNA GO CALL
YOUR MANAGER.

48:38.483 --> 48:40.318
SHOULD PROBABLY
HAVE AN ANSWER BY NOW.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.488
I'VE GOT REALLY GOOD NEWS.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.728
TOMORROW MORNING,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

49:25.563 --> 49:26.764
-REALLY?
-YEAH.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.766
IT'S ALL BEEN FINALIZED.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.601
A LOT MORE MONEY
WAS OFFERED UP

49:30.635 --> 49:32.570
BY "GOSS!" MAGAZINE.

49:32.603 --> 49:34.072
THEY'RE GONNA GET IT OVER
TO YOUR MANAGER,

49:34.105 --> 49:36.107
HE'S GONNA PASS
THE CASH ALONG TO ME,

49:36.141 --> 49:39.177
AND YOU'LL BE FREE TO GO.

49:39.210 --> 49:43.248
-HE DID IT.
-YEAH, IT'S ALL OVER.

49:43.281 --> 49:45.750
-HOW MUCH WAS OFFERED?
-A QUARTER OF A MILLION.

49:45.783 --> 49:48.419
FUCK, A QUARTER
OF A MILLION?

49:48.453 --> 49:51.422
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

49:51.456 --> 49:54.425
SHE'S ACTUALLY GONNA
HAVE A REAL CHANCE NOW.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.596
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

49:58.629 --> 50:00.731
I'M SO GRATEFUL.

50:00.765 --> 50:04.069
-IT'S OKAY.
-NO, THIS IS--

50:04.102 --> 50:06.137
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

50:06.171 --> 50:10.175
I'M SO SORRY
I PUT YOU THROUGH
ALL OF THIS.

50:10.208 --> 50:12.077
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

50:12.110 --> 50:13.778
WE NEED TO CELEBRATE.

50:13.811 --> 50:16.114
-CELEBRATE?
-YEAH, OF COURSE.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.182
IT'S YOUR LAST NIGHT
OF CAPTIVITY,

50:17.215 --> 50:19.050
IT'S MY LAST
NIGHT OF FREEDOM.

50:19.084 --> 50:20.551
DO YOU LIKE CHINESE FOOD?
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

50:20.585 --> 50:21.719
I COULD RUN OUT, GET A COUPLE
OF BOTTLES OF WINE,

50:21.752 --> 50:23.454
PUT 'EM IN THE FRIDGE.

50:24.822 --> 50:28.193
-SURE.
-OKAY.

50:28.226 --> 50:29.694
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA RUN OUT
REALLY QUICK.

50:33.731 --> 50:36.101
MIMI, PLEASE.

50:36.134 --> 50:39.204
-WE'RE SO CLOSE.
-IT'S OKAY.

50:39.237 --> 50:42.673
FRANK, WE HAVE A DEAL, RIGHT?

50:42.707 --> 50:46.144
OKAY. I WON'T BE LONG.

51:40.931 --> 51:45.236
SO I GUESS, WE MEET
AT THE AGREED LOCATION.

51:45.270 --> 51:48.239
I'M SURE YOUR MANAGER
WILL HAVE BROUGHT THE COPS

51:48.273 --> 51:50.708
EVEN THOUGH I OF COURSE
TOLD HIM NOT TO.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.743
YOU'LL GO WITH HIM,

51:52.777 --> 51:55.913
AND THEN I'LL HAND MYSELF
OVER TO THE POLICE.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.615
ARE YOU SCARED?

52:02.287 --> 52:03.188
A LITTLE.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.195
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

52:10.228 --> 52:12.663
IT'S ALL GONNA BE
ARRANGED BEFOREHAND.

52:12.697 --> 52:14.365
I'VE TRANSFERRED
THE MONEY ONLINE,

52:14.399 --> 52:16.401
SO IT'LL BE MOVED AROUND
TO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS

52:16.434 --> 52:20.738
SO IT'S HARDER TO TRACE.
BUT WILL YOU BE OKAY?

52:20.771 --> 52:22.807
I'LL BE FINE.

52:29.747 --> 52:30.681
UM...

52:32.650 --> 52:34.785
I FEEL A LITTLE SILLY
TELLING YOU THIS,

52:34.819 --> 52:38.256
BUT I WANTED TO GET YOU
SOMETHING.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.827
YOU GOT ME SOMETHING?

52:46.397 --> 52:49.800
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'LL LIKE IT.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.337
I GOT IT IN BASICALLY
THE SMALLEST SIZE
I COULD FIND.

52:52.370 --> 52:55.373
I FIGURED
THAT WOULD FIT YOU.

52:55.406 --> 52:57.508
I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE

52:57.542 --> 53:01.946
-THE HOUSE IN MY CLOTHING.
-THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

53:01.979 --> 53:04.249
WISH YOU HADN'T
GIVEN IT TO ME AFTER I'VE
EATEN ALL THIS FOOD.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.918
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

53:16.427 --> 53:17.795
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT ON?

53:54.799 --> 53:56.567
STUNNING.

54:00.405 --> 54:03.641
A TOAST, TO YOU.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.047
-OH.
-OH, GOD.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.517
-OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.
-IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

54:12.550 --> 54:13.884
IT'S NOTHING A LITTLE WASH
CAN'T HANDLE. IT'S FINE.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.820
I'M SORRY.

54:31.869 --> 54:35.540
UM, IT'S GETTING LATE.

54:35.573 --> 54:37.808
WE BOTH HAVE
A BIG DAY TOMORROW,

54:37.842 --> 54:41.846
AND I NEED MY BEAUTY SLEEP
FOR MY MUG SHOTS, SO...

54:41.879 --> 54:42.580
SURE.

54:44.915 --> 54:46.451
COME HERE.

54:47.818 --> 54:49.854
YOU'RE AMAZING.

54:53.924 --> 54:55.393
'NIGHT, FRANK.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.413
THANKS FOR BEING SO BRAVE,
MISS WYATT.

56:22.447 --> 56:23.881
YOU CAN SIT UP NOW.

56:39.964 --> 56:41.932
ARE YOU ON ANY KIND
OF CONTRACEPTION?

56:41.966 --> 56:43.801
YEAH.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.438
THAT'S GOOD.

56:58.783 --> 57:01.051
I'LL GO TO THE COPS,
YOU SICK FUCK!

57:01.085 --> 57:02.553
YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

57:05.623 --> 57:07.558
HERE.
HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

57:14.164 --> 57:17.067
HELP! HELP!

57:17.101 --> 57:19.236
STOP THE CAR! STOP!
PLEASE! PLEASE HELP!

57:19.269 --> 57:21.539
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA
TAKE ME TO THE COPS.

57:21.572 --> 57:23.608
I NEED TO GO TO THE COPS
RIGHT AWAY, PLEASE.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.510
PLEASE,
I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED.

57:25.543 --> 57:28.078
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.447
THE POLICE STATION IS
TEN MINUTES FROM HERE.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.229
YOU KNOW, I BET YOU GET THIS
ALL THE TIME,

57:45.262 --> 57:47.965
BUT YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

57:49.567 --> 57:51.201
LIKE THAT GIRL, UM...

57:51.235 --> 57:54.705
-MIMI?
-MIMI WYATT?

57:54.739 --> 57:58.509
YEAH. OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

57:58.543 --> 58:00.711
YOU'RE HER, AREN'T YOU?

58:00.745 --> 58:03.213
HAVE THEY BEEN
LOOKING FOR ME?

58:03.247 --> 58:05.850
-WHO?
-WELL, ANYBODY.

58:07.718 --> 58:09.587
I DON'T KNOW.

58:12.289 --> 58:14.291
COME ON, GIVE ME TROUBLE.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.293
I HAVE ONE UNDER.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.829
PUT HIM IN CELL FOUR
SO HE CAN COOL DOWN A BIT.

58:18.863 --> 58:20.130
-ALL RIGHT.
-WE'LL DEAL WITH HIM LATER.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.999
COME ON!

58:22.032 --> 58:23.668
COME ON, GET IN HERE.

58:23.701 --> 58:26.303
SHIT, THAT'S MIMI WYATT.
COME ON.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.640
GIRL, YOU'D BETTER NOT FUCK
BRANNING BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS!

58:29.674 --> 58:31.676
BUT YOU CAN FUCK ME
ANY TIME!

58:31.709 --> 58:34.311
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MA'AM.
SIR, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

58:34.344 --> 58:36.313
MY NAME IS MIMI WYATT

58:36.346 --> 58:39.650
AND I'M HERE TO REPORT
A KIDNAPPING.

58:39.684 --> 58:41.619
HOLD ON A SECOND.

58:41.652 --> 58:44.288
SARGE.
FRONT DESK. YEAH.

58:52.730 --> 58:54.198
SIR, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

58:57.067 --> 58:58.836
WANT TO TAKE A SEAT?

58:58.869 --> 59:01.171
-WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
-NO, THANKS.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.107
SERGEANT BRYAN WILL BE
WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.308
FOLLOW ME.

59:15.786 --> 59:18.322
NOW, FROM YOUR STATEMENT,
WE'RE GONNA BRING THE SUSPECT

59:18.355 --> 59:21.792
ON THE OFFENSES
OF FALSE IMPRISONMENT,
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

59:21.826 --> 59:23.728
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

59:23.761 --> 59:26.196
TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T GET
HIS HANDS ON ANYONE ELSE.

59:26.230 --> 59:30.267
NOW YOU SAID
HIS NAME WAS FRANK.

59:30.300 --> 59:32.202
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

59:32.236 --> 59:34.038
YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THE HOUSE?

59:34.071 --> 59:37.341
ANY LANDMARKS YOU SAW,
SHOPS, STREETS?

59:37.374 --> 59:42.947
NO. NO, I'M SORRY.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.815
HE GAVE THE ADDRESS
WHEN HE ORDERED TAKE OUT,

59:44.849 --> 59:48.953
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.628
GIVE ME A SECOND, PLEASE.

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:11.241
LET'S GET THE GUY
THAT BROUGHT HER IN

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.678
TO SHOW US EXACTLY WHERE
HE PICKED HER UP FROM.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:16.346
THEN I WANT YOU TO CALL
ALL THE CHINESE FAST FOOD
RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.783
AND SEE WHAT DELIVERIES
WERE MADE IN THE LAST
FEW NIGHTS.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.350
YOU NEVER KNOW,
WE MAY GET LUCKY.

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.024
HERE YOU GO.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.028
LISTEN, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.363
WE'VE GOT OUR BEST PEOPLE
WORKING ON THIS, OKAY?

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:41.906
-YOU GOT LUCKY.
-HOW SO?

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:44.675
DRIVER KNEW THE STREET
HE PICKED HER UP FROM.

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:47.377
QUITE A FEW
CHINESE RESTAURANTS
DOWN THERE THAT DELIVER,

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:52.282
AND ONE CONFIRMED
THAT THEY DELIVERED
TO A FRANK WATSON.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:55.285
OFFICERS ARE PICKING HIM UP
AS WE SPEAK.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.888
-ALL RIGHT.
-THAT'S NOT ALL.

01:00:57.922 --> 01:01:00.190
TAKE OUT GUY SAID
THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FRANK
THAT PLACED THE ORDER,

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:01.425
IT WAS MIMI
THAT ANSWERED THE DOOR.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.427
DRIVER RECOGNIZED HER.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.896
THAT'S ALL HE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT EVER SINCE.

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.165
FRANK-- WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY?

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:11.101
31, FROM BOSTON,

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.805
GRADUATED FROM COLUMBIA
WITH A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:16.807
SINGLE, NO DEPENDENTS,
NO PRIORS,

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:17.808
NOT EVEN A PARKING TICKET.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.480
LET'S BRING MR. WATSON IN
FOR A LITTLE CHAT.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.982
ALL RIGHT.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.102
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.005
LET'S GET STARTED.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:55.746
THE TIME IS 8:23.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.215
SERGEANT BRYAN HERE
WITH DETECTIVE HAYES

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:00.717
INTERVIEWING FRANK WATSON.

01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:05.189
SO, FRANK.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.857
YOU'VE CONFIRMED
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
THE CAUTION

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.458
AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE
THIS INTERVIEW

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:10.260
WHILE YOUR ATTORNEY
IS ON HIS WAY.

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.763
YES.

01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:14.064
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE?

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:15.532
I UNDERSTAND ALLEGATIONS
HAVE BEEN MADE

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.367
AND THAT THEY ARE
A PATHETIC ATTEMPT

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.236
AT GETTING BACK AT ME.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.806
-GET BACK AT YOU FOR WHAT?
-HURTING HER.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:26.243
EMOTIONALLY.
NOT PHYSICALLY.

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:28.212
I NEVER LAID
A FINGER ON HER.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.546
THERE WAS NO
PHYSICAL CONTACT?

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.415
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:32.549
YES, THERE WAS
PHYSICAL CONTACT,

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.218
BUT I NEVER ASSAULTED HER.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.787
DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH THE COMPLAINANT?

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:39.123
YES, I HAD SEX WITH MIMI.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:42.092
SO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
HAVING INTERCOURSE
WITH MISS WYATT?

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:44.461
-YES, SHE WANTED TO.
-HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.831
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MISS WYATT?

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.398
NOTHING SERIOUS.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:51.168
IT WAS MORE
OF A PHYSICAL THING.

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:56.306
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:00.110
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:02.012
I MEAN, HOW DO WE SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN?

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:04.448
WHY WOULD WE SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN?

01:03:06.851 --> 01:03:11.388
BECAUSE THIS WAS GOOD.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:12.890
REALLY GOOD.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:17.327
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
THE LAST TIME.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.938
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GO HOME NOW, MIMI.

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:31.608
-WHAT?
-LEAVE.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.211
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN. "LEAVE"?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:38.348
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:42.152
-WHAT MONEY?
-THE MONEY. MY RANSOM.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.954
YOU WON'T GET IT
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:46.490
WHAT ARE YOU GOING ON ABOUT?

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.292
THIS WAS JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF FUN, OKAY,

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.928
BUT YOU GOTTA GO NOW.
THIS ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:54.131
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU KIDNAPPED ME!

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:56.000
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU BABBLING ABOUT,
YOU CRAZY BITCH?

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.467
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.169
-GET OUT. COME ON.
-YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED,

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:01.838
NOW YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
YOU FUCKING USED ME.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.010
WE FUCKED ONCE.
GET OVER IT.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.545
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.951
HOW DID YOU MEET?

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:15.385
IN A CLUB
A FEW NIGHTS AGO.

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:17.621
-WHEN?
-THURSDAY NIGHT.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:19.656
I WAS AT A CLUB IN TOWN.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.491
WE HUNG OUT,
GOT TO CHATTING,

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.961
AND I BROUGHT HER HOME
THAT NIGHT.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.330
THE COMPLAINANT
LEFT VOLUNTARILY?

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.966
YES. HER FRIENDS HELPED HER
GET INTO MY CAR.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.339
SO YOU WERE IN THE CLUB
ON YOUR OWN?

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.640
NO, NOT TO START WITH.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:38.042
I WAS WITH A FRIEND.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.676
IN FACT,
YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.211
HE DIDN'T SEE ME LEAVE
THE CLUB WITH MIMI,

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:42.679
BUT HE DID GIVE ME
A LIFT HOME YESTERDAY

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.615
AND HE SAW HER
ASLEEP ON MY SOFA.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.217
NAME AND ADDRESS.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.254
PAUL ROBERTS.
1022 THREE FOREST LANE.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.938
-NO FUCKING WAY!
-SHH!

01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:10.374
-YOU WERE SERIOUS.
-KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.277
SHE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.080
SO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
TO FUCK THIS UP.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:19.149
OF COURSE, BUT I AM
EXPECTING FULL DETAILS.

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:21.051
YEAH, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:22.987
SOON AS SHE REALIZES
I'M SOME BROKE IDIOT

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.488
AND RUNS BACK TO BRANNING,
I'LL FILL YOU IN.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.557
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.534
HAD YOU MET THE COMPLAINANT
BEFORE THURSDAY?

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:39.236
NO.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.005
AND YOU SAY SHE VOLUNTARILY
WENT HOME WITH YOU?

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:42.572
YES, MA'AM.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.175
AND YOU'VE BEEN WITH HER
FROM THURSDAY

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:46.443
TO THE EARLY HOURS
OF THIS MORNING?

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:49.013
YEAH. SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO LEAVE.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:50.747
SAID SHE WAS TIRED
OF BEING PHOTOGRAPHED,

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.283
HAVING TO DO MEET AND GREETS,
THAT KIND OF SHIT.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:54.985
SAID SHE WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE
WHERE NOBODY COULD FIND HER,

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:58.455
WHERE SHE COULD BE NORMAL
WITH A REGULAR GUY.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.757
PATRONIZING BITCH.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.994
LET'S GO BACK
TO HOW YOU TWO MET.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.762
I WAS AT A CLUB DOWNTOWN.

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:11.301
SHE WAS THERE HOSTING,
ON THE MAIN FLOOR DANCING
WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:13.670
SHE WAS DOING SOME PHOTOS
WITH SOME GUYS,

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.505
YOU KNOW, SELFIES.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.774
ONE OF THE GUYS GOT
A LITTLE TOO TOUCHY-FEELY.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.443
THERE WAS SOME
PUSHING AND SHOVING,

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.612
SHE LOOKED UPSET.
I STEPPED IN TO BREAK IT UP.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.448
THAT'S WHEN
WE STARTED TALKING.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.417
SO WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:30.654
WELL, SHE WAS SO DRUNK,
HER FRIENDS THOUGHT
IT WAS TIME SHE LEAVE,

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:31.688
SO I OFFERED
TO DRIVE HER HOME.

01:06:34.058 --> 01:06:36.160
-HI, SWEETIE!
-MIMI!

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:39.129
IT'S JOHN AND KELLY.

01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:41.665
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT
AT WESTWAY, REMEMBER?

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:43.067
THE MADONNA?

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:51.408
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING A GOOD NIGHT THEN.

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:55.045
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL BE DOING ANY MORE
DANCING TONIGHT.

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:56.713
HOW YOU DOING?
I'M FRANK, MIMI'S FRIEND.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.182
-OH, JOHN.
-HOW ARE YOU?

01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:00.717
-ANOTHER BIG NIGHT, HUH?
-YEAH, YEAH.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.486
SHE'S HAD ENOUGH, I THINK.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.322
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY BEST
IF SHE GETS HOME SOON.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.756
THE FRONT IS SWARMING
WITH PAPARAZZI.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.592
I'VE GOT MY CAR.
I COULD BRING IT AROUND BACK.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.160
I KNOW THE GUY
WHO RUNS THIS PLACE.

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:12.796
HE'LL LET US
USE THE STAFF EXIT.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:15.132
I'M SORRY, WHO ARE YOU?

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:17.701
-OH, I'M KELLY.
I'VE HUNG OUT WITH MIMI.
-KELLY, YES, YES.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.670
MIMI MENTIONED YOU GUYS.
SHE TOLD ME HOW MUCH FUN
YOU GUYS HAD.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:23.073
LISTEN, I WOULD HATE TO SEE
HER GET JUDGED LIKE THIS

01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:24.508
JUST 'CAUSE SHE'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME, YOU KNOW?

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.542
-YEAH.
-YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.377
TAKE HER OUT THE BACK EXIT.

01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:29.213
I'LL MEET YOU
ON THE ROAD OUTSIDE.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:30.380
-OKAY.
-OKAY. COOL, COOL.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.387
HER FRIENDS HELPED HER
OVER TO MY CAR.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:39.523
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT,
SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH OUT OF IT.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.857
OUT OF IT.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.692
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OUT OF IT"?

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.428
SHE WAS COMPLETELY WASTED.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.330
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TAKE HER HOME?

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.332
I TOLD YOU, SHE ASKED ME
TO TAKE HER BACK TO MINE.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:51.468
SHE SAID HER PLACE WOULD BE
SWARMING WITH PAPARAZZI.

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.704
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT
HAS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.873
MISS WYATT,
WE JUST WANT THE FULL STORY.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.208
WERE YOU INTOXICATED?

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:03.313
YES, I WAS DRINKING
THAT NIGHT.

01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:04.648
SO TELL ME HOW YOU GOT
TO THE PROPERTY

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.150
WHERE YOU WERE HELD HOSTAGE.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:08.818
I DON'T REMEMBER.

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.720
I CAN'T REMEMBER
LEAVING THE CLUB.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:13.157
I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH
AFTER MY MEET AND GREET.

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:18.228
LOOK, I'M A GENTLEMAN.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.229
I WOULD NEVER
EXPLOIT A WOMAN

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:22.631
WHO'S CLEARLY HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:25.435
ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T
TOUCH HER THAT NIGHT,

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.804
OR THE NEXT DAY EITHER.
WE JUST HUNG OUT.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.906
MR. WATSON, YOU KEPT HER
AGAINST HER WILL

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.243
-FOR THREE DAYS.
-NO. NO, I DIDN'T.

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:35.779
SHE WANTED TO STAY.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.314
SHE COULD HAVE LEFT
AT ANY POINT.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.715
DID SHE EVER LEAVE?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.550
YES, SHE DID,
AND SHE CAME BACK.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:43.752
THAT'S BULLSHIT.
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
ASKING ME THIS?

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:46.290
I TOLD YOU I WAS KIDNAPPED.
I COULDN'T LEAVE.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.925
SO YOU NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.926
I TRIED TO,
BUT HE TOOK ME BACK TO HIS.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.162
AGAINST YOUR WILL?

01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:54.198
OF COURSE.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.365
SO DID HE EVER
LEAVE THE HOUSE?

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.500
NO.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.169
WELL, ONCE.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:02.272
RIGHT. TO BUY YOUR DRESS.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.939
YEAH, HE BOUGHT ME
A DRESS.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.942
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GONNA DO THAT.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.743
SO HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THE TEXT?

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:08.845
WHAT TEXT?

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:09.879
HERE.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:15.519
THERE'S HER TEXT
TELLING ME WHAT SIZE SHE IS

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:18.322
AND WHERE TO GET THE DRESS,
EVEN SAYING SHE'LL PAY ME BACK.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.923
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO HANG ONTO THIS.

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:21.725
SURE.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.893
THAT'S A LIE.
THAT'S A FUCKING LIE!

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:24.961
I NEVER TEXTED HIM.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.863
HE HAD MY PHONE
THE ENTIRE TIME.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.631
HE MUST'VE USED IT.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:29.866
DOESN'T YOUR PHONE
HAVE AN ACCESS CODE?

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.935
-YES.
-SO HOW DID HE GET IT?

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:34.638
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.372
DID HE FORCE YOU
TO GIVE HIM THE CODE?

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.974
YES!

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.809
WHAT IS IT HE DID, MIMI?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.810
I CAN'T REMEMBER,
BUT I WAS SCARED.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:44.881
HE NEEDED MY PHONE
TO CONTACT MY MANAGER
ABOUT MY RANSOM.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.517
MIMI, WE'VE SPOKEN
TO YOUR MANAGER.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.987
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT A RANSOM.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.988
IN FACT, HE GOT A TEXT FROM YOU
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.891
SAYING THAT YOU WANTED
A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.827
WELL, THAT MUST'VE BEEN HIM,
FRANK SENDING THOSE,

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.530
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN MY PHONE
SINCE I WAS TAKEN.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.233
FRANK GAVE IT TO US.
SAID YOU LEFT IT AT THE HOUSE

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:04.268
BEFORE YOU RAN OFF
REAL MAD.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:11.375
AND THAT NIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:13.910
WHILE I WAS OUT, I PICKED UP
A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.012
AND THE DRESS.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.948
MY FRIEND PAUL
GAVE ME A LIFT HOME.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:21.751
ORDERED CHINESE FOOD.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:23.787
SHE EVEN PAID
THE DELIVERY BOY AT THE DOOR.

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:31.761
DELIVERY.

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:32.496
THANK YOU.

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:35.932
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:41.738
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.341
YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO LEAVE,

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.009
AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:49.446
CAN'T YOU SEE
WHAT HE'S DOING?

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.881
HE'S TWISTING EVERYTHING.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.522
DETECTIVE HAYES, YOU MIND
GIVING ME AND MISS WYATT
A MOMENT, PLEASE?

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:01.725
SURE.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:18.308
MISS WYATT, YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR STORY CLEAR AND FAST,

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:20.910
BECAUSE HIS IS PRETTY SOUND.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.080
SO PLEASE, TALK TO ME.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:28.818
YOU WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR
UNATTENDED AND DIDN'T LEAVE.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:31.054
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:33.923
HE KIDNAPPED ME.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:36.326
HE LIED TO ME
SO I WOULDN'T LEAVE.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.928
HE USED ME
FOR WHAT HE WANTED.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:41.698
HE TOLD ME
HE HAD A DAUGHTER.

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.667
SO YOU WANT ME
TO ARREST HIM FOR TELLING YOU
THAT HE'S A FAMILY MAN.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.370
-BUT HE LIED!
-AND YOU'VE ALWAYS
TOLD THE TRUTH?

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:48.738
THE WHOLE TRUTH AT THAT?

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.510
SHE EVEN TOLD ME
THAT ENTIRE STORY WAS A LIE.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.446
SHE NEVER DATED
OR EVEN SLEPT WITH BRANNING.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.549
SHE TRIES
TO RUIN MEN'S LIVES

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.551
BECAUSE SHE'S
A MEDIA-GRUBBING,

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:04.554
ATTENTION-SEEKING,
CONNIVING LITTLE WHORE.

01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:06.656
I MEAN,
ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS?

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.025
HE WOULD HAVE HAD SEX
WITH ME IF I'D WANTED TO.

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:13.029
I WAS DOING HIS WIFE A FAVOR.
SHE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE.

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:17.000
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:19.803
FRANK USED ME,

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.806
MANIPULATED ME,
VIOLATED ME.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:28.445
PLEASE, DON'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:32.081
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA SAY,
YOU BOTH PLAY GOOD GAMES.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:39.523
-HE RAPED ME.
-HE RAPED YOU?

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.158
YES.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.528
MY CLIENT HAS BEEN
FULLY COMPLIANT

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:46.996
AND HAS ANSWERED
ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.832
YOU HAVE A DRUNK GIRL
WITH A HISTORY OF LYING

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.467
AND RUINING
MEN'S REPUTATIONS.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.602
LET'S LEAVE THE TRASHY
MAGAZINE GOSSIP OUTSIDE

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:55.472
AND JUST STICK TO THE FACTS,
SHALL WE, COUNSELOR?

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:59.175
I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS FACTS,
BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.878
THIS IS A CASE WHERE IT IS
ACCEPTED BY BOTH SIDES

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.747
THAT THEY HAD SEX.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.882
THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER
IT WAS CONSENSUAL,

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.017
AND ONE OF THE PARTIES
HAS A REPUTATION

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:11.555
FOR SLEEPING AROUND,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY LYING.

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:14.658
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S CONCENTRATE
ON THE FACTS.

01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:18.194
YOU HAVE A COMPLAINANT
WHO ADMITS SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
IN THE HOUSE

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:21.197
WHILE MY CLIENT
WENT TO BUY HER A DRESS.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.733
SHE OPENED THE DOOR
TO A CHINESE DELIVERY DRIVER

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:28.004
AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
OR EVEN PASS ON A MESSAGE.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.540
THE COMPLAINANT WAS SEEN
ASLEEP ON THE SOFA,

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.976
UNBOUND AND
FREE TO MOVE AROUND,

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:36.045
FREE TO WALK OUT OF THE BUILDING
IF SHE WANTED TO DO SO.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:37.614
OKAY, BUT THAT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:39.549
THAT SHE'S ALLEGING
THAT HE RAPED HER.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:42.085
THE KIDNAPPING STORY
IS A JOKE.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:45.889
THE FALSE ALLEGATIONS OF RAPE
ARE NOT REMOTELY FUNNY.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:50.293
THIS PROVES
MY CLIENT'S INNOCENCE.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:57.567
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON
WHY MR. WATSON NEEDS TO STAY
ANY LONGER.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:03.973
MEDICAL RESULTS
CAME BACK INCONCLUSIVE.

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:06.976
HOWEVER, WE DID FIND
MR. WATSON'S DNA.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:10.113
SO I WANT TO KNOW,
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:12.649
TELL HIM TO STOP
WHEN HE MADE ADVANCES ON YOU?

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:15.251
I KEEP TELLING YOU.
WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ME?

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.955
I WAS SCARED FOR MY LIFE
AND BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:21.691
I WAS DESPERATE
TO GET OUT OF THERE.

01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:25.094
BUT I WAS TRICKED
INTO THINKING THAT IF I DID,

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.096
A YOUNG GIRL WOULD DIE.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.198
WHY ARE YOU
QUESTIONING ME?

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:34.771
MISS WYATT,
WE'VE SEEN THE VIDEO.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.843
THE VIDEO? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:42.011
IF YOU HAVE VIDEO,
WE NEED TO SEE IT.

01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:53.089
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL NIGHT FOR THIS.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.595
SO HAVE YOU.

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:40.036
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.138
I HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS
IN THE HOUSE.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.307
IT'S A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.175
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:49.178
SHE WAS CLEARLY
ENJOYING HERSELF.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:50.914
AND THE TAPES RUN THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE HOUSE?

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:53.249
YEAH. YOU CAN SEE US
PLAYING CARDS,

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.784
HAVING DINNER TOGETHER,

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:57.153
WATCHING TV, DANCING--

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.788
ME EVEN SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH ONE NIGHT

01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:00.356
WHEN SHE WASN'T UP FOR IT.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.091
I JUST--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.593
WHY SHE WOULD DO
ALL OF THIS.

01:16:03.627 --> 01:16:06.796
BECAUSE OF HER EGO, MAYBE.

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:09.799
WOMEN LIKE HER
AREN'T USED TO REJECTION.

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.368
MY CLIENT HAS BEEN
VERY FORTHCOMING

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.370
WITH PROVIDING EVIDENCE

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.206
AND COOPERATING
WITH ALL YOUR QUESTIONING.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.143
THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE
IS OVERWHELMING.

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:22.311
MY CLIENT WILL NOT BE ANSWERING
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.180
AND WILL NOT BE PROVIDING
ANY FURTHER EVIDENCE

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:25.615
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

01:16:25.649 --> 01:16:28.351
IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE
THIS DEBACLE,

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:30.887
WE WILL BE BRINGING
HARASSMENT CLAIMS AGAINST YOU.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:34.758
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON
WHY MR. WATSON

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.025
NEEDS TO STAY ANY LONGER.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:45.802
HE CAN'T JUST LIE TO ME
SO I FALL FOR HIM,

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.303
AND THEN JUST,
AFTER WE HAVE SEX--

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.739
MIMI, IF THAT WAS THE--
IF THAT WAS A CRIME,

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:52.208
THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION
WOULD BE IN PRISON RIGHT NOW.

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:53.677
BUT HE DID KIDNAP ME.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.046
HE CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.282
-AND HE WON'T.
-MIMI, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.751
OF YOU EVER LEAVING THE CLUB
AGAINST YOUR OWN WILL.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:04.721
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:07.724
AND WHEN YOU HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK HELP,
YOU CHOSE NOT TO.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.726
I KNOW, BUT I WAS SCARED.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:13.797
OKAY! YOU WERE SCARED.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.331
LISTEN, WE CAN PASS
THE FILE TO THE D.A.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.300
IF THEY THINK THERE'S A CASE,
IF YOU WANT.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:20.269
YEAH. I DON'T WANT HIM
TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.774
OKAY, MISS WYATT.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:30.246
THEY'VE INFORMED US
THAT FRANK WILL BE
PURSUING YOU

01:17:30.279 --> 01:17:32.716
FOR HAVING HIM ARRESTED,
FOR SLANDER,

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.250
-AND FOR ASSAULT.
-YOU'RE KIDDING.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:36.285
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:40.289
THE VIDEO CLEARLY
SHOWS YOU SLAPPING HIM.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.125
WHAT DO I--
WHAT DO I DO?

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.327
IT'S OKAY, MIMI.
WE'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.139
WHY WOULD YOU LIE, MIMI?

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.406
HAVE YOU NO SHAME?

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.276
ARE YOU GOING TO
APOLOGIZE, MIMI?

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.712
WERE YOU DRUNK?
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?

01:18:02.746 --> 01:18:04.480
MIMI! MIMI!

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.888
-FRANK!
-FRANK!

01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:20.329
HOW WAS SHE IN BED?

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:22.899
MY CLIENT, FRANK WATSON,
HAS BEEN COOPERATING

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:25.735
WITH THE AUTHORITIES AND ALL
CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

01:18:25.769 --> 01:18:29.238
MY CLIENT WILL BE
ISSUING A CIVIL CASE
AGAINST MISS WYATT,

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:31.107
AND IN LIGHT
OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS,

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.409
WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING FURTHER
AT THIS STAGE. THANK YOU.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.856
FRANK! DID YOU DO IT, FRANK?

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.357
TELL US SOMETHING, FRANK.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.926
ANY PIECE OF INFORMATION
WOULD HELP.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.061
FRANK!

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:53.262
TELL US SOMETHING, FRANK!

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:01.905
I THINK YOU'RE VERY BRAVE
FOR COMING OUT

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:05.008
AND SPEAKING TO US
ABOUT YOUR STORY.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:07.143
WELL, I FEEL THE PEOPLE
NEED TO HEAR IT FROM ME.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:08.878
YOUR LIFE MUST BE
CRAZY AT THE MOMENT.

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:11.915
IT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE.

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:14.918
I MEAN, YOU WERE JUST
THROWN INTO THE LIMELIGHT.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.385
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
QUITE A SHOCK.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:17.386
WELL, YEAH.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.389
SO WHY DO YOU THINK MIMI

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.926
WOULD DRAG YOU INTO
ALL OF THIS?

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:25.394
JUST ANOTHER PUBLICITY STUNT.
BUT IT COULD RUIN MY LIFE,

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.396
AND I WASN'T GOING TO
STAND FOR IT.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.565
I'M STANDING UP
FOR ALL THE MEN OUT THERE

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.801
WHO'VE BEEN TAINTED
WITH SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:34.070
BASED ON THE WORDS
OF A SCORNED WOMAN.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:36.439
WE ARE GONNA MOVE PROGRESS
BACK 50 YEARS

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:38.107
IF WOMEN WITH GENUINE CLAIMS

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:39.442
FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T
COME FORWARD.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:41.244
SOPHIA, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.579
I HAVE A TEENAGED NIECE.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.549
SHE NEEDS POSITIVE FEMALE
ROLE MODELS IN HER LIFE.
