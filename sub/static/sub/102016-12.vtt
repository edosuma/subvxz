10:52.390 --> 10:55.132
I'm a simple man who
does a job few wish to,

10:55.176 --> 10:58.483
but one that brings
comfort to others.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.921
Which conveniently involves
being surrounded by dead people.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.749
So, thanks
for the Ted talk,

11:02.792 --> 11:04.185

that this is a coincidence.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.316
What I think

11:05.360 --> 11:08.319
is that you and your father

11:08.363 --> 11:09.320
need help.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.974
Professional help.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.324

nor will I ever be,

Yeah, so you say.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.246
Okay, "Ted,"

11:22.290 --> 11:25.293
let's assume for a second here
you are telling the truth.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.077
Why are you in Mystic Falls?

11:27.121 --> 11:28.078
I don't know.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.124
I have amnesia.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.648
Mm. Hmm.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.433
A few weeks ago,
I awoke not far from here

11:35.477 --> 11:37.958

11:38.001 --> 11:40.351

11:40.395 --> 11:42.614

this charming place.

firm believer

11:48.272 --> 11:50.622
well, I'm making the best of it.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.712
So you're not the source
of the monster problem?

11:52.755 --> 11:54.365
No.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.846
Sorry for scuttling
your psychotic agenda,

11:56.890 --> 11:58.543
but you'll have to
come up with a plan B

11:58.587 --> 12:00.023
elsewhere.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.633
Well, unfortunately,
plan B involves you, too.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.548
Now, there is
a mystical artifact

12:03.592 --> 12:04.898
I'm in desperate need
of answers about,

12:04.941 --> 12:06.943
and I think
you could help me get them.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.424
But it's gonna require you
to become The Necromancer

12:09.467 --> 12:11.121
again...Bah!

12:12.340 --> 12:13.863

except The Necromancer.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.363
Although intentionally bringing
The Necromancer to the surface

12:35.406 --> 12:37.539
sounds like something we'd live
to regret, if we're lucky.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.490

a Hot Topic supervillain.

But we're running out
of options,

20:54.078 --> 20:55.254
and I need to know
what's going on

20:55.297 --> 20:56.690
as much as you do.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.308
Great. More needles.

21:06.352 --> 21:09.485
It's my blood, which Landon has
a strong reaction to.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.923
That sounds
very dangerous.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.317
And brilliant.
And, yes, extremely dangerous.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.840
Kind of like her.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.495
I guess you inspired me.

21:19.539 --> 21:20.931
No. This is your doing.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.629
Please reconsider.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.240
This will only end with
someone getting hurt.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.111
Only a couple drops
on your skin.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.636
Okay, don't inject it.
Promise me, Landon.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.551
I mean, whatever you are.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.248
You had it right the first time.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.997
Nothing's happening.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.651
It doesn't make sense.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.349
I know who... [groans]

21:47.393 --> 21:49.743
Hope, make it stop.Landon. Hold on. Consilium.

21:49.786 --> 21:52.311
[groaning]

21:57.751 --> 21:59.927
MG:
This whole thing was a bad idea.

21:59.970 --> 22:03.365
What are you talking about? You
wanted us to be partners, right?

22:03.409 --> 22:05.367
Well, this is the only way
that that works.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.195
Yeah, that doesn't mean
we should do it.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.240
What we should do

22:09.284 --> 22:10.633
is tell Dr. Saltzman the truth.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.505
Better late than never.Fine.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.724
But let's do it after
you turn me into a vampire.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.163
You'd have to die.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.601
I'll jump off the falls
or-or something.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.037
Quick and painless.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.039
Hey, you said
the Salvatore School's

22:25.082 --> 22:26.649
having enrollment problems,
and I could definitely

22:26.693 --> 22:28.477
help the football team and...

22:31.219 --> 22:33.961
I'm never gonna talk you
into this, am I?

22:34.004 --> 22:37.530
I'm sorry, E,
but take it from me.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.576
Being a vampire-- it's not
about the powers you gain.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.361
It's about all the stuff
you lose.

22:44.145 --> 22:46.103
And I would feel terrible

22:46.147 --> 22:49.193
if you lost anything else
because of me.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.467
Thank you.

23:02.642 --> 23:05.775
No, MG. Thank you.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.430
For what?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.694
For healing me last night.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.609
Which means

23:13.653 --> 23:15.394
there's still vampire blood
in my system,

23:15.437 --> 23:18.397
which is what you told me
turns a human to a vampire.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.922
And for the first time
in forever,

23:21.965 --> 23:24.751
I know exactly
what I'm supposed to do.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.453
Ethan.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.194
Please.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.501
I'll see you on the other side,
partner.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.461
[whooshing]

23:39.505 --> 23:40.810
[gasping]

23:43.247 --> 23:44.466
[truck door closes]

23:44.510 --> 23:47.121
Get in here and help me.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.296
I fear it is too late

23:48.339 --> 23:49.340
for that.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.170
Give me your hair tie.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.609
At least you finally

23:56.652 --> 23:58.524
believe him?Fifty-fifty.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.221
But he's not a monster.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.876
And he passed your tests.
What else would he be?

24:02.919 --> 24:04.834
Only one thing-- Malivore.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.097
But either way,
he's still my boyfriend.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.751
And if Malivore is
using him as a vessel,

24:08.795 --> 24:10.492
then I need to figure out
what that means for Landon.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.537
And if he is

24:11.580 --> 24:12.755
Malivore, what then?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.235
I have no idea.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.671
He'd be in the one person
on the planet

24:15.715 --> 24:18.108
that I can't bring myself
to fight.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.769
For what it is worth,

24:26.813 --> 24:29.598
I wish our circumstances
were different.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.383
Me, too. Please go

24:32.427 --> 24:34.385
and get Dr. Saltzman.

24:36.910 --> 24:40.261
Landon, are you in there?
Can you hear me?

24:41.741 --> 24:44.744
Don't move.
You're hurt really bad,

24:44.787 --> 24:45.962
and you're gonna be
in a lot of pain.

24:46.006 --> 24:48.835
No, I don't feel anything.

24:48.878 --> 24:51.533
[groans]Then you're in shock.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.057
No. That's not possible.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.977
'Cause I remember
everything now, Hope.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.241
And I'm not who you think I am.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.853
In that case, I'm gonna go
get something sharp.

25:10.639 --> 25:12.728
You can't.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.039
You don't want to hurt me.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.345
Oh, I want nothing else.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.653
Where's that truth orb
when you need it?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.699
Remember, you're still
Malivore. You know what

25:26.742 --> 25:29.092
my blood does to you.
If not, ask your arm.

25:30.311 --> 25:33.488
Oops. I'm not even
a fully-activated Tribrid.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.751
You know, if you kill me,
you'll trigger my vampire side.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.666
I'll just come back
stronger than ever.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.363
I'm counting on it.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.018
Because I'm not Malivore
either.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.195
[gasps]

25:50.766 --> 25:53.508
[groans]

25:53.552 --> 25:55.554
[gasps]

26:06.042 --> 26:10.481
Heroes are supposed
to save people, not kill them.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.571
You don't deserve a name

26:12.614 --> 26:14.790
or a costume.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.841
A costume.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.155
TED:
Am I interrupting

26:32.199 --> 26:34.070
something important?

26:34.114 --> 26:36.159
Oh, just me pouring another
glass of inspiration, so, yes.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.248
Oh, then, I'll get
straight to the point.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.163
You blame me
for your current dilemma.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.687
In part.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.385
But the truth is, I am
the one responsible.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.605
I'm the theoretical
adult who helped one

26:46.648 --> 26:48.563
of my students open
the not-so-theoretical

26:48.607 --> 26:49.956
Pandora's box.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.654
You truly love this school.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.047
Oh, this is
just a building.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.875
But the kids? Yes.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.486
And until I stop Malivore,
they'll never be safe here.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.357
Well, then perhaps we should
work on that together.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.272
Redeem ourselves.How?

27:02.316 --> 27:04.057
You made it pretty clear
you won't do what I need you to.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.493
You've made it clear

27:05.536 --> 27:07.451
you don't believe I've changed.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.715
So maybe we're both wrong.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.934
In that spirit,
if you'll pardon the pun...

27:14.545 --> 27:16.765
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.246
Mr. Leonardo da Vinci,

27:19.289 --> 27:21.857
joining us
from the spectral plane.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.511
[laughs]
You trust me now?

27:23.554 --> 27:24.773
I wouldn't go that far.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.296
Baby steps, then.

27:26.340 --> 27:30.431
There is, however,
one complication.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.563
[speaking Italian]

27:36.350 --> 27:38.395
You don't happen
to speak Italian, do you?

27:39.309 --> 27:40.571
HOPE:
Answer my question.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.531
[grunting]

27:52.235 --> 27:54.455
Because I'm officially mad.[yells]

27:54.498 --> 27:55.674
And you're running out of limbs.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.111
[grunts]

27:59.460 --> 28:02.289
Last chance.
Who or what are you?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.773
It doesn't matter.I beg to differ.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.123
Because I can't kill you until
I'm certain I won't be murdering

28:10.166 --> 28:12.386
my boyfriend.Landon is dead.

28:12.429 --> 28:15.476
None of this would be happening
if you had just accepted that.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.391
Accepted me!

28:17.434 --> 28:19.306
In case you hadn't noticed,
I sort of suck at acceptance,

28:19.349 --> 28:21.090
so I'm gonna need some proof.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.226
What is that?

28:27.357 --> 28:29.316
CLEO:
Luctus.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.188
What does it mean?

28:37.890 --> 28:40.327
Proof.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.025
You're not Malivore,
and he didn't make you.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.028
I did.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.528
[sighs heavily]

29:09.530 --> 29:11.445
[wind whistling]

29:18.844 --> 29:22.412
[grunting]

29:22.456 --> 29:24.458
What the hell, MG?! MG?![groaning]

29:27.548 --> 29:30.029
Blursome. Oh!Come on, buddy, hang on.
Hey, hey...

29:30.072 --> 29:32.161
[grunting]

29:34.468 --> 29:36.775
Oh.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.821
[panting]

29:39.865 --> 29:42.476
[gasping][sighs]

29:42.519 --> 29:44.434
[panting]

29:44.478 --> 29:45.914
Hey.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.048
Totally blursome.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.444
HOPE:
At least we know what you are.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.446
You're a golem.
Would have

29:56.490 --> 29:58.144
saved us both a lot
of pain and suffering

29:58.187 --> 30:00.624
had you just come out
and said it.I didn't know.

30:00.668 --> 30:04.890
And I wouldn't exist if you had
been okay with the truth.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.414
You're gonna cease existing
in about a minute.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.546
[grunting]

30:11.244 --> 30:13.550
Now I know why you've
been so perfect.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.378
You're an idealized version
of Landon.

30:15.422 --> 30:19.121
A puppet made from his remains
and my memories of him.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.428
Which means that someone else is
pulling your strings.

30:21.471 --> 30:24.387
Don't get up. I'll come down.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.607
[grunts]

30:26.650 --> 30:30.219
Hope, don't do this.

30:30.263 --> 30:33.222
She was only trying
to make you better.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.095
ALARIC:
So what does that even mean?

30:36.138 --> 30:37.618
[speaking Italian]

30:37.661 --> 30:39.663
I think what he's trying
to say...

30:39.707 --> 30:41.274
[speaking Italian]

30:41.317 --> 30:42.492
...is he needs to use
the bathroom.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.320
Ghosts don't pee.

30:44.364 --> 30:45.321
[speaking Italian]

30:45.365 --> 30:46.845
ALARIC:
Jed,

30:46.888 --> 30:48.890
I thought you said
you spoke Italian.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.066
Well, what I said is that
I've been to Rome on vacation.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.983
So, a little bit. Espresso.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.593
Prego.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.508
Pizza.Ah!

30:58.552 --> 31:00.162
Great. So if he's hungry or
thirsty, we know who to call.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.903
Well, maybe if you let
us have Internet access

31:01.947 --> 31:04.123
at this school, we could
translate what he's saying.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.646
But until then,

31:05.689 --> 31:07.996
grazie,which means...

31:08.040 --> 31:11.043
Even I know what that means,
Jed. Now get out of here.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.261
Okay.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.568
Good luck in there.

31:14.611 --> 31:15.656
Tough room.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.353
Dr. Saltzman,

31:17.397 --> 31:18.702
there's something wrong
with Landon.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.487
How wrong?

31:20.530 --> 31:22.271
I suggest you bring
your deadliest weapon.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.971
Cleo?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.975
Que faccia bella.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.499
You two know each other?

31:32.542 --> 31:35.110
[speaking Italian]

31:35.154 --> 31:36.068
ALARIC:Cleo.

31:37.591 --> 31:38.722
How is this possible?

31:42.204 --> 31:43.945
Cleo.

31:47.557 --> 31:48.907
Cleo!

31:48.950 --> 31:50.343
Ow!

31:51.344 --> 31:53.302
HOPE:
It was Cleo.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.870
It's been Cleo this whole time.LANDON:
More like

31:55.914 --> 31:57.176
a collaboration.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.221
Her spells, your memories.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.310
Kind of like
when Lucas and Spielberg...

32:01.354 --> 32:03.922
You can stop pretending
you're Landon.[Landon grunts]

32:03.965 --> 32:05.706
Game's over.Why?

32:05.749 --> 32:07.969
Everything you remember
about Landon has been imbued

32:08.013 --> 32:09.275
into my being,
and my very being

32:09.318 --> 32:10.624
is made from his remains.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.017
Is that supposed
to be comforting?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.714
Because it's just gross.Well,

32:13.757 --> 32:15.934
it's as close to him
as you will ever be again.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.023
So maybe consider that
before you kill me.You're not even alive.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.112
You're a coping mechanism,
and I don't need it anymore.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.809
Hope, think.

32:21.852 --> 32:23.419
I'm practically immortal.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.552
I don't get sick,
I don't break down

32:25.595 --> 32:27.293
and die like humans do,

32:27.336 --> 32:30.165
and no one's trying
to use me as a vessel.

32:31.210 --> 32:34.082
You can be actually immortal

32:34.126 --> 32:36.998
if we activate
your vampire side.

32:37.042 --> 32:40.132
By which you mean die.Oh, potato, po-tah-to.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.612
Face facts, Hope.
Landon was human.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.788
You were always
gonna lose him
