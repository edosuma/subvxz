00:27.595 --> 00:28.796
[man breathing heavily]

00:38.672 --> 00:39.973
[man] Oh, yeah.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.475
Mm, right there.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.078
Yeah, you got it.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.449
[moaning]

00:48.882 --> 00:50.351
[exhaling]

00:52.019 --> 00:53.521
[laughing]

00:56.424 --> 00:58.492
Oh, where'd you learn to
give a hummer like that?

01:00.094 --> 01:01.795
Middle school.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.764
[man] That's funny.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.666
Well, I should
probably split.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.138
Can I drop you
off somewhere?
Mall or...

01:12.273 --> 01:13.774
Aren't we
forgetting something?

01:15.008 --> 01:16.244
Yeah.

01:19.947 --> 01:20.914
[man] Sorry about that.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.150
-Get this.
-Yeah, getting it.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.221
It's only 18 bucks.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.657
I'll--
I'll get you back next time.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.192
I don't think so, buddy.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.627
Hey, what're you doing?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.197
-Quick--
-What's going on here?

01:36.230 --> 01:39.233
-Who're they?
-Smile, Dale.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.603
You are
on candid camera, motherfucker.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.005
I just got head
from a 17-year-old.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.040
Now playing at
a prison near you.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.477
Okay, quit fucking around.
Give me my keys.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.544
I am a cop.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.446
You're going to prison,
you fucking criminal.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.849
[Dale] Okay,
put the phone down.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.886
We got your
license plate on camera.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.388
You're so fucked.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.756
Okay, that--
That's entrapment.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.825
That won't ever hold up
in a court of law.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.794
We're not taking you to court.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.497
We're just taking your money.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.266
[giggling]

02:15.869 --> 02:17.571
[beeping]

02:30.918 --> 02:33.120
It's only 400 bucks.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.622
Is that all you got
in your bank account?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.424
How much do you
think a cop makes?

02:36.457 --> 02:38.659
Well, that's depressing.
You're a grown ass man.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.861
We ever catch you trolling
for underage pussy again,

02:40.894 --> 02:43.631
I swear to God,
we're uploading
that shit to the Cloud.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.899
Please do no do that.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.968
That shit will spread like HPV.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.804
You fucking... male.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.374
[all laughing]

02:53.407 --> 02:55.008
Can I go now, please?

02:55.042 --> 02:56.544
Go. Run along.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.982
[all] Bye, Dale.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.384
Fuck you.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.720
You guys wanna go
to Dairy Queen?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.955
-For sure. Yeah.
-Yeah?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.566
[laughing]

03:18.599 --> 03:24.004
* Make me the one
In diamond chains *

03:24.037 --> 03:29.977
* Don't break my heart
Cause I never felt pain *

03:30.010 --> 03:36.250
* Our souls still young
Yeah we never been through *

03:36.284 --> 03:40.688
* Hell and back
Tell me that's not you *

03:42.690 --> 03:48.462
* Keep our eyes upon the sky
Never let the feeling die *

03:48.496 --> 03:51.432
* Never catch us
In our ride *

03:52.032 --> 03:53.501
* Ride

03:53.534 --> 03:59.307
* We'll never grow up
Our heaven won't change *

03:59.340 --> 04:04.312
* And our blind hearts
Will never know pain *

04:05.546 --> 04:08.115
* Living on clouds
Never look down *

04:08.148 --> 04:10.818
* Till one day we float away
We'll never grow up *

04:10.851 --> 04:14.988
* We'll never grow up
No not today *

04:16.624 --> 04:19.660
* And our heaven won't change

04:28.569 --> 04:34.007
* Isn't it fun
Having no fear *

04:34.041 --> 04:38.746
* To love without hurt
It's crystal clear *

04:40.848 --> 04:46.554
* Keep our eyes upon the sky
Never let the feeling die *

04:46.587 --> 04:49.857
* When you got me
In your arms *

04:49.890 --> 04:51.725
* Arms

04:51.759 --> 04:56.397
* We'll never grow up
No not today *

04:57.331 --> 04:59.567
* And our heaven won't change

05:10.077 --> 05:11.979
-Mama?
-Yeah?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.648
Eh, Mama, come in here.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.485
Come and tell me hi.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.454
-Hey.
-Hi.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.289
How you feeling,
you little nerd?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.592
Come here.
I need some--
I need love.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.293
-Come here.
-I can't--

05:26.326 --> 05:28.061
[laughing]

05:29.863 --> 05:30.998
[kissing]

05:32.533 --> 05:35.035
-How's the studying?
-It's a fucking nightmare!

05:35.068 --> 05:36.770
It's like nothing
is penetrating.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.272
The finals are next week,
and I'm so fucked.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.909
Why're you studying
if you don't wan to?
You don't have to.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.611
Sherman's rich.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.446
I mean, he's richer...

05:45.479 --> 05:47.515
and I-- I want to.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.149
This is something
that I want to do,

05:49.182 --> 05:54.988
and now, finally,
I'm with somebody
that is supportive of that.

05:55.022 --> 05:59.092
At least Dad wasn't
some boring loser who
collects old pinball machines.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.795
Can you be
nicer to Bob, please?

06:01.829 --> 06:04.732
Just don't be
so tough on him.
I know he's not cool.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.599
No, he's not.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.468
But he's a good, good person.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.537
He cares about you
very, very much.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.742
I don't want him
in our house, in our space.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.710
It's not just
our space anymore.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.113
-Sorry.
-Mom!

06:21.749 --> 06:24.518
Although, I don't know
what he'd say if he found this.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.387
Where'd you find that?

06:28.188 --> 06:29.356
In the bathroom, last night.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.024
That's what I was
just looking for.

06:32.325 --> 06:36.029
Dude, whatever you do
on your own time,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.531
is totally up to you.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.133
-Okay.
-But you cannot just
leave that lying around.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.270
Sherm would have a fucking
heart attack if he saw this.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.673
-Mom...
-Mm hm.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.442
Do we need ti have
another chat with Dr. Demarcia?

06:48.476 --> 06:51.612
No. Dr. Demarcia is
a sexual predator.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.448
He is! Why do you
always do that?
I'm not making it up!

06:54.482 --> 06:55.816
I'm not going back to him.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.753
I just...
Come here...

07:00.954 --> 07:01.889
What?

07:04.658 --> 07:08.028
I just need you to
not freak anybody out tonight.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.730
-Okay?
-Okay.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.098
You're ashamed of me,
or something?

07:11.131 --> 07:14.267
No, I'm not
ashamed of you,
you crazy bitch!

07:14.301 --> 07:16.470
Just, this dinner
is very important.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.874
All right, I just
don't want you to--
You can be scary.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.945
So I just need you
to put it in check.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.881
Okay?
[whispers] I love you most.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.518
[kissing]

07:32.052 --> 07:35.122
Can you wash your hair
before this evening?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.591
It just smells a little funky.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.193
[Laurie] Bye!

07:40.227 --> 07:42.229
[girls laughing]

07:42.930 --> 07:43.864
So close!

07:45.933 --> 07:48.936
Why don't you ever buy shit
with the money we make
from these perverts?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.437
I've been saving up.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.705
For what?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.075
I'm going to DeVry, bitch!

07:55.108 --> 07:56.443
[laughing]

07:56.476 --> 07:58.679
[Erica] 98% acceptance rate.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.180
[Kala] Dream big or go home!

08:02.049 --> 08:04.017
Yo, check it out.
Hot, old guy is back.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.758
[people cheering]

08:14.294 --> 08:15.763
[mouthing] He's so hot.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.031
He's old enough
to be your dad.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.868
I'd fuck your dad so hard
if that was your dad.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.672
That's a good thing.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.073
But why is he always here?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.208
Like, he's literally never
not at the bowling alley.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.610
I hope he's not lonely.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.111
Oh, I don't think so.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.215
I feel like his dick
has a tax attorney.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.450
[laughing]

08:37.484 --> 08:39.787
No, his dick could like,
pay off his mortgage.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.690
He's too old, Erica.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.992
I wanna hold his hand.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.495
What're we doing later?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.397
You wanna come
over to my place,
play Mario Kart?

08:50.430 --> 08:54.501
Uh, I would,
but I have to go meet
my future step-brother tonight.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.304
I don't understand.
Your mom's been
with Sherm for a year.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.306
Like, how have you
not met that guy?

08:59.339 --> 09:03.410
'Cause he's been in rehab
this whole time, and now
he's coming to live with us.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.813
Cool. Maybe he's sexy
and on heroin.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.582
Yeah, like Kurt Cobain vibe.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.950
-Okay.
-I want that for you.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.819
I'll see you guys later?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.954
-All right, good luck.
-[all] Bye.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.059
I'm so full!

09:19.092 --> 09:21.194
Stop eating that, then.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.431
I'm not gonna touch it.
I won't touch it,
but it's really growing.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.666
Do you see that thing?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.801
It hurts like shit.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.237
[indistinct]

09:30.270 --> 09:32.740
Holy shit, is that him?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.677
[Erica] Damn. He's hot!

09:36.710 --> 09:38.511
Oh, I know.
How hot is he?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.413
That's Shorty.
That's his sponsor.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.015
-So that's not Luke?
-No.

09:42.049 --> 09:42.916
Which one is--

09:43.617 --> 09:46.053
Now there's Luke.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.389
-[Laurie] in the... That coat.
-[Erica] Okay, you shitting me.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.791
[Laurie] What's the problem?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.826
[Erica] Mom, why didn't you
tell me that he's that?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.728
-What do you mean?
-That he's a big boy.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.963
'Cause I knew
you'd be a fucking cunt.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.032
Junkies are
supposed to be skinny.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.902
Shut up.
Just get your shit together.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.204
-[Laurie] Hi, guys!
-Hi!

10:04.237 --> 10:06.173
Oh, there he is,
there he is!

10:06.206 --> 10:07.140
[Bob] Hey, gang.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.044
Erica, can you scoot over?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.612
Erica, please?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.648
-All right. Hey, bud.
-[Bob] Take a seat, Luke.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.885
-Plenty of room. Don't be shy.
-[Laurie] You wanna
take that jacket off?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.620
[Bob] There you go.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.890
[Laurie] Okay...
You okay?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.424
Squeeze in there,
I don't want to get your jacket.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.794
[Laurie] You got to really
squeeze yourself in there.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.129
[Bob] There we go.
Here we are.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.865
Everybody in?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.835
So nice to meet you finally.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.436
It's really nice
to meet you, Laurie.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.805
Oh, so polite.

10:37.838 --> 10:42.409
So, any special
music requests for DJ Sherm?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.946
-We got some hard rock,
some soft rock.
-You're so funny.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.648
Country...

10:48.682 --> 10:50.751
How about...
Yeah, let's try that.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.186
-Okay.
-That's pretty good.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.554
Here we go.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.156
[singing loudly]

10:56.189 --> 10:57.424
[groaning]

10:57.457 --> 11:00.060
[upbeat song plays]

11:00.093 --> 11:04.264
[Bob] I love this.
It has a cool...
little rhythm here.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.935
-[Erica sarcastically] DJ Sherm?
-[Bob] Yes, ma'am.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.636
[Erica] This music sucks ass.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.971
[Bob] Is that a good thing?
[Erica] No.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.572
[Laurie] Yes!
[Bob] Fair enough.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.207
We'll find something else.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.679
[Laurie] Oh, my God,
it looks so...
[Bob] A real sophie's choice.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.549
[Laurie] Well, what are you
in the mood for, honey?
Something hot or cold?

11:22.582 --> 11:23.917
Let's start there.

11:29.556 --> 11:33.493
[Bob] This is, uh,
on the pricey side.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.863
I don't need all these sides.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.966
-We could split apps.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.735
Not that.

11:41.769 --> 11:46.539
So, Erica, you must be
psyched to have an
older brother type in the house

11:46.573 --> 11:51.278
that can turn you on to music
and movies and comic books,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.145
and things like that.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.914
[sarcastically] Mm,
totally psyched.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.984
I get to have a complete
stranger living in my home.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.186
-No offense, buddy.
-[gasps]

11:59.219 --> 12:01.154
[Laurie] Well, everybody is a
stranger until you
get to know them.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.489
-That's true.
-I mean, just look at you guys.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.624
You hardly
knew each other.
Now, you're like...

12:04.657 --> 12:06.359
-We're best buds.
-Thick as thieves.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.360
Put it up.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.098
-Hi. You guys
ready to order?
-How are you?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.867
Hi. This is the
guest of honor, right here.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.969
Order anything you want
on the menu.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.605
-Uh, not exactly.
-Yes, let him. Just let him.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.241
The doctor has him
on a special diet,

12:21.274 --> 12:25.913
so no processed sugar
or gluten or carbs

12:25.946 --> 12:29.449
or red meat.
And dairy is discouraged.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.085
-But, other than that,
anything you want, cowboy!
-Yes.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.221
Besides that, anything else.
There's a lot of options.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.357
Maybe we could grab some twigs
from that tree outside.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.525
-[table rattles]
-Ow.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.561
I'll--
I'll just order last.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.263
-Sure, yeah take a second.
-Sure.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.732
-I'll start things off.
-Thank you so much.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.535
Yeah, I was thinking
about the hors d'oeuvres.

12:48.568 --> 12:53.073
You know what's really looking
good to me is the salad.

12:53.106 --> 12:57.144
Oh, yes.
Well, two salad bars
for me and my lady.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.312
Then we can make
our own choices.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.148
-That sounds nice.
-Right? Right. Right.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
[kissing loudly]

13:04.384 --> 13:06.386
[Laurie laughing] So cute.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.620
I'm gonna look like a girl.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.089
[waitress] You also
want the salad bar?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.124
I don't want
the salad bar at all.

13:11.158 --> 13:17.230
I want the buffalo wing blasters
with extra butter, bacon, mash,
and an ice-cold mountain dew.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.365
Thank you very much.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.934
Okay, you're up, dude.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.206
Take it.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.908
-[Laurie] Get a salad bar?
-[Bob] Okay, all right.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.742
-Luke...
-Or jello...

13:29.776 --> 13:31.444
[Bob] It's okay.
Jut count to ten.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.981
Just count to ten.
You got it.
Hey, Luke, come on.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.249
You're trained for this now.
Come on, buddy.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.952
Just do the exercises.
Do the work.
Count to ten.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.488
-Are you okay?
-[Bob] Breathe through the nose.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.523
-It's--
-[Laurie] What can
we do, honey?

13:43.556 --> 13:44.892
[Erica] Mom, what's going on?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.326
-Out through the mouth.
-[all gasping]

13:48.661 --> 13:49.562
[Erica] Shit!

13:49.596 --> 13:50.898
Damn it.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.466
[sighing]

13:53.500 --> 13:55.002
He's surprisingly fast.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.705
I think that maybe
you should go after him, honey.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.073
What? Why?

14:00.107 --> 14:03.176
'Cause I asked you to.
'Cause it would be kind.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.348
I'll give you ten bucks.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.884
-Fifteen.
-Hey, Laurie.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.920
-Stop it, Bob, this is just--
-Twenty.

14:12.953 --> 14:17.257
Twenty dollars,
and he better come back in.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.093
You're not getting
20 bucks until
he's back here in his chair.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.995
-Better be back here.
-I got it.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.066
It's not an effective strategy.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.635
It's effective for us.
So, that's just...

14:29.869 --> 14:31.338
[traffic sounds]

14:33.106 --> 14:35.308
[Erica] Dude?
What's up?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.579
Running away from
your new fam already?

14:40.613 --> 14:41.648
Hello?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.116
[muttering]

14:43.383 --> 14:44.417
What?

14:45.085 --> 14:46.586
I just needed some air.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.359
Kinda looked like you were
having a heart attack.
Are you okay?

14:53.626 --> 14:55.028
It's a panic attack.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.332
Why don't you think
of something peaceful, like...

15:01.901 --> 15:04.171
kitten and a baby bear
making out.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.572
-That may--
-Doesn't help.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.606
Didn't help?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.541
Unreal.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.179
It's fine.
I'm used to it, really.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.586
What were you in rehab for?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.223
Pills.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.994
-Oxys, mostly.
-Oh.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.262
So, you like to get low.
I feel you.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.332
I don't do drugs.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.703
People think that's lame...

15:36.736 --> 15:38.505
but fuck them, you know.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.176
Are you okay?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.079
I'm not--
I'm not helping?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.319
Do you want a blowjob?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.124
-What?
-Do you want a blowjob?

16:02.562 --> 16:03.863
Like right now?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.165
-Like here?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.966
-Yeah, you seem very tense--
-No.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.701
And I think
it could really help with

16:08.735 --> 16:10.337
-whatever it is
you're going through.
-Stop.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.705
I won't ask. I just--
I'll just blow you.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.975
I like sucking dick.
It's not--
It wouldn't be a burden.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.944
Are you fucking with me?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.579
No, I'm not
fucking with you.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.151
It's not like we're related
or anything, dude.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.453
-Calm down. Here, just--
-Jesus-fucking-Christ!

16:27.054 --> 16:29.156
Just, no, okay?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.261
Fine. I couldn't find
your dick anyway, asshole.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.535
Sorry, that was mean.

16:42.569 --> 16:46.139
And you're probably a virgin,
and you're 16.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.276
Poor boy.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.378
I'm 18.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.680
And you refused
a blowjob from me?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.648
Like, I know you're shy, but...

16:58.518 --> 17:00.287
Oh, you're gay!

17:00.320 --> 17:02.289
-Why didn't you say so?
-I'm not gay!

17:02.322 --> 17:03.723
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with being gay.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.958
I just don't want a blowjob
from my future step-sister.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.694
What is so hard
to understand about that?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.131
Fuck! Leave me alone!

17:11.664 --> 17:12.699
Okay.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.569
[exhales]

17:16.603 --> 17:17.470
[Erica] Whatever!

17:21.674 --> 17:23.943
[school bell ringing]

17:23.976 --> 17:26.679
I mean,
he's literally fat as fuck.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.015
No fucking way.
That sucks.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.551
He's also a weird
drug addict and very gay.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.885
You know, if you have
a gay brother,

17:32.919 --> 17:34.587
you get to jack off
to the same porn.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.788
How do you know he's gay?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.557
'Cause I tried to suck his dick
and he turned me down.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.959
That's so fucked up.
He's like,
basically your brother.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.262
I'm not trying to
have sex with him or anything.
I'm not a psychopath.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.830
[groans]

17:43.863 --> 17:45.532
Oh, my God, babe!

17:45.565 --> 17:46.999
-[whispers] What the fuck?
-Babe, are you okay?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.768
Yeah. I wasn't gonna
eat that shit anyway.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.737
I'm sure, slut.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.207
Hey, Ali.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.042
Why you such
a fucking bitch?

17:56.075 --> 18:00.680
Erica, I'm having
a lot of trouble
hearing what you're saying

18:00.713 --> 18:02.615
without a dick in your mouth.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.584
I really wanna punch you
in the face right now.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.054
I just don't wanna ruin
those lip injections
that daddy gave you.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.757
At least my daddy
is not in fucking jail.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.024
Shut the fuck up!

18:12.058 --> 18:13.226
Oh, shit.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.198
[Ali] Get her off me!

18:19.132 --> 18:20.367
[Ali screaming]

18:22.068 --> 18:23.536
Get the fuck off of me.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.405
Fucking psycho!

18:26.139 --> 18:27.274
[spits]

18:41.788 --> 18:44.624
[strumming the guitar]

18:50.497 --> 18:52.499
[music playing on earphones]

19:01.107 --> 19:02.509
Momma.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.143
Hey, Mummy.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.378
We need to talk.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.415
It wasn't my fault.
She fucking started it.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.184
-Oh, no, I'm not talking
about that cunt.
-Look!

19:11.218 --> 19:12.619
-Oof.
-Oh, it hurts.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.388
Oh, you gotta keep it lubed up
or else it's gonna scar.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.324
I can't even--
That's disgusting.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.726
Listen...

19:19.759 --> 19:21.861
Bob says you've been
really tough on Luke.

19:22.862 --> 19:23.830
-Mm?
-Mm?

19:25.432 --> 19:27.600
-What about it?
-I need you to apologize.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.769
-Apologize?
-Yeah.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.538
I'm not gonna apologize.
What am I, 12 years old?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.573
It's not a question, lady.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.375
I'm telling you
you have to apologize.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.743
Right, and I'm not gonna.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.913
Okay, listen.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.017
-He just got out
of rehab, right?
-I know that.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.953
He's feeling really,
really tender.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.155
-Mm-hm.
-We don't know
what that feels like.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.258
Let's just try
to be human beings.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.729
Bob...

19:56.763 --> 20:01.133
is internalizing his emotions
and I'm feeling
very worried about him.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.003
Stop it, you.
No, focus, please.

20:04.036 --> 20:08.040
I know that this has been
a really, really, really
difficult transition for you,

20:08.074 --> 20:09.642
and I know it's not easy.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.279
I really appreciate everything
that you have been doing.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.314
You're a sweet, sweet girl.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.017
And I need you
to say one thing

20:18.050 --> 20:20.620
-one nice thing to Luke.
-To Luke?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.121
For me.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.891
Please. It'll go so far.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.794
Will you give me hair tickles?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.764
-Will you say something nice?
-Mm-hm.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.269
Okay.
Practice with me.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.804
Can we come up
with one nice thing

20:37.837 --> 20:40.006
-that we can say
to that human being?
-Yeah.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.810
I'll tell him, um,

20:43.843 --> 20:46.245
that if his plane crashes
into a mountain,

20:46.279 --> 20:49.181
he'll be able to keep
a whole lot of
starving passengers--

20:49.215 --> 20:50.450
-Stop it!
-Ow!

20:50.483 --> 20:52.385
It would just make
my life so much easier--

20:52.419 --> 20:54.287
It looks like he should
smell crazy bad...

20:54.321 --> 20:56.489
-Still not helping.
-But he doesn't.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.626
And...

21:01.060 --> 21:02.529
he has nice eyes.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.269
[both laughing]

21:10.970 --> 21:12.639
What!

21:12.672 --> 21:15.508
Did she say
something nice about somebody?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.310
[whispers] Shh.
Don't tell anyone.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.812
-I'm gonna scream it
to the neighbors...
-[Erica mock screaming]

21:19.846 --> 21:22.315
-and the secret will be out.
-No, you won't. [laughing]

21:23.983 --> 21:25.818
[screaming]

21:28.688 --> 21:31.524
[upbeat song
plays in background]

21:37.664 --> 21:39.766
[Bob] All right, everybody,
hot dogs are ready.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.902
-Come get them
while they're hot.
-[Laurie] Hot dogs, hot dogs.

21:42.935 --> 21:46.072
And some steamed carrot dogs
for you, Lukemeister.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.376
[Bob] Oh, there she is.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.080
Oh, that's what I need.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.314
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.349
-Cheers.
-Cheers to you.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.817
-Top chef.
-My love.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.253
Got some hot dogs here,
got some buns in the back.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.855
You idiot! [laughing]

22:04.256 --> 22:06.459
-Hey, Erica?
-What!

22:06.493 --> 22:10.763
Why don't you come over here
and do Chef Sherm a solid
and deliver these to Luke.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.401
Okay, I'm coming.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.636
[music stops]

22:18.971 --> 22:20.973
-[Bob] It's all good, huh?
-[Laurie] Mm-hm.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.511
Why do I have to do that?

22:24.544 --> 22:27.647
Erica, we talked about this.
You have to be nice to him.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.549
-[Laurie] Be nice.
-[Erica] Okay.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.784
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.820
-That wasn't too bad.
-I got this.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.955
Hello.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.190
The Sherm wanted me
to give these to you.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.727
Great. I'm not that hungry.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.901
Is that your rat?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.437
His name is Titty.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.338
You named your rat "Titty?"

22:52.371 --> 22:56.576
Titty boy. He only eats Cheetos
and his favorite show
is 16 and Pregnant.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.012
I always thought
rats were gross.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.949
Rats are like the most
misunderstood creatures
on earth, okay?

23:02.982 --> 23:05.618
They get blamed
for tons of shit,
like the plague,

23:05.652 --> 23:07.019
which wasn't even their fault.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.088
Gerbils are the ones that
are actually sketchy as fuck.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.163
Wanna go eat some real food?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.733
-You're gonna go get food?
-Yeah.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.335
-Right now?
-Mm-hm.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.137
-Are you inviting me?
-Yeah.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.506
Cool sunglasses.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.408
I like them.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.644
Let's go.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.916
-[Laurie] Hi.
-[Bob] Hey.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.185
-[Bob] Where you guys going?
-To go buy some crack.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.152
You know, throw it down.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.123
[Laurie whispers]
It's okay. It's okay.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.692
They're not buying drugs, Bob.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.460
-Just let them hang out.
-No, I get the joke.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.166
Oh, my God.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.570
[moaning]

24:00.206 --> 24:04.110
Going to town on that thing,
aren't you! Whoa!

24:04.877 --> 24:07.046
This is like
the first real food

24:07.714 --> 24:09.849
I have had in months.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.451
Don't tell Sherm.
Glad to see you happy, though.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.689
So my therapist says that,

24:17.724 --> 24:19.992
I have a lot of anxiety issues.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.160
Mm-hm.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.565
I get angry a lot.

24:25.598 --> 24:30.570
So, food kinda just
calms me down and makes me
think less of those situations

24:30.603 --> 24:33.673
that I get anxious over.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.944
Sorry I've been
such a rude bitch lately.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.613
Never really had
a brother before.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.715
I don't know
how to act around you.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.652
Also, you and Sherm
are like, in my space and shit,

24:45.685 --> 24:49.288
and I don't really
want you guys there.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.860
I mean, I've never had a sister
who tried to blow me before,
so the feeling's sort of mutual.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.162
Offer still stands, by the way.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.364
I'm trying to pretend
like that never happened.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.166
Dude, you need to loosen up.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.702
I'm serious.
I'm like the dick whisperer.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.838
-[Luke chuckles]
-I'm extremely gifted.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.541
So you don't mind doing it
to guys who you don't know.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.543
-No.
-Doesn't matter who?

25:10.577 --> 25:14.013
A dick is just like
a thumb without a fingernail,
if you really think about it.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.048
Aren't you worried
about diseases or--

25:16.082 --> 25:19.085
-No, I'm not.
-Aren't you worried about
people calling you a slut.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.890
I don't care what
other people think about me.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.057
Why you looking
at me like that?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.593
It's not like
I fuck these dudes.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.427
-Really?
-Yeah.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.563
If a dude goes around
eating a bunch of pussy,

25:30.597 --> 25:33.232
nobody gives a fuck.
Nobody calls him a slut.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.001
Called feminism.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.270
Yeah, no, I get that.
I understand that.

25:38.304 --> 25:42.341
Besides, dude, it's better
for you than eating burgers
and popping pills all day.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.210
I don't pop pills anymore.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.546
When I did, it was the kind
that suppressed your appetite,
not make you eat more.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.550
So are they gonna
send you to fat camp next?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.552
Oh, they tried to
send me to fat camp.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.554
I came back fatter.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.523
Sherm was really pissed.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.191
That's Sherm.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.095
So, what happened to your dad?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.264
My dad's the shit.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.835
Is that all?

26:08.868 --> 26:11.804
He got caught a few months ago
trying to rob a casino, so...

26:13.305 --> 26:15.908
Trial day hasn't hit,
so I'm saving up
to bail him out.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.344
-It's no big.
-Whoa.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.080
[laughs nervously]

26:21.113 --> 26:23.049
-Do you wanna see
what he looks like?
-Yeah.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.153
Don't we kinda look alike?

26:27.186 --> 26:30.156
I mean, it's kind of
a small picture, but yeah.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.697
Oh, my God.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.832
[Luke exhales]

26:39.866 --> 26:41.033
You okay?

26:41.533 --> 26:42.835
[Luke exhales]

26:43.602 --> 26:44.603
What's up?

26:44.637 --> 26:46.906
Just calm-- Luke!

26:47.506 --> 26:48.841
Where are you going?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.143
Luke?

26:51.177 --> 26:54.080
Totally normal way
to end a conversation, bro.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.649
What's up, guys?

27:08.294 --> 27:09.328
[phone beeps]

27:10.529 --> 27:12.264
[keypad clacking]

27:16.703 --> 27:18.037
[phone beeps]

27:19.038 --> 27:20.272
[clattering]

27:31.650 --> 27:32.952
Oh, my God.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.521
Just leave me alone, please.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.889
What the fuck are you doing?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.091
Get the fuck out!

27:39.591 --> 27:40.927
[crashing]

27:43.462 --> 27:45.097
[Luke muttering] Stupid.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.933
So fucking stupid.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.067
[crying]

27:49.235 --> 27:50.569
Oh, my God, are you okay?

27:50.602 --> 27:52.839
-Don't touch me.
-I'm not gonna touch you.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.041
I'll just, um...
Don't move.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.043
[screaming] Mom!

28:09.521 --> 28:10.689
Is he okay?

28:10.723 --> 28:12.825
Yeah, just gonna have
a couple of stitches

28:12.859 --> 28:14.861
but other than that,
he should be fine.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.996
Your mom's back there
with him right now.

28:18.564 --> 28:23.936
I know he's kind of messed up
but I feel like he was fine
a few hours ago.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.839
Yeah, well, Luke's, uh...

28:26.873 --> 28:29.809
Luke's a complicated little guy.

28:29.842 --> 28:33.746
There's a lot about him
you don't really know.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.248
[Erica] Like what?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.885
Uh, just...

28:40.186 --> 28:45.257
Bunch of years ago,
uh, Luke, uh accused
a teacher of, uh,

28:46.793 --> 28:48.560
[clears throat]
uh, fondling him.

28:48.594 --> 28:49.829
What!

28:52.298 --> 28:53.833
Touching his penis...

28:54.733 --> 28:56.102
private areas...

28:57.536 --> 29:00.539
and apparently,

29:00.572 --> 29:02.975
Luke thinks
he saw him around town,

29:03.009 --> 29:07.346
but he won't say exactly where.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.781
[lighter flicking]

29:12.684 --> 29:13.886
Okay.

29:13.920 --> 29:18.424
He didn't say whether
it was today or... No?

29:18.457 --> 29:24.931
Well, apparently,
there were some inconsistencies
with Luke's story, and uh,

29:24.964 --> 29:31.370
the police don't
necessarily have the
evidence they need to verify...

29:31.403 --> 29:34.273
They think he was lying.
They don't believe him.
Why would he lie?

29:34.306 --> 29:36.642
I don't know.
It's so fucked up, Sherm.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.277
Yeah, believe you me.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.645
I'll tell you what...

29:39.678 --> 29:41.347
There's nothing I'd rather do

29:41.380 --> 29:43.782
than go over to
this motherfucker's house
in the middle of the night

29:43.816 --> 29:46.485
with some car batteries
and jumper cables,

29:47.586 --> 29:50.156
and go to town
on that motherfucker.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.859
But, you know,
you got to let
the law do its thing.

29:54.726 --> 29:55.928
Anyways...

29:55.962 --> 29:58.330
What we need
to do right now is,
we need to

29:58.364 --> 30:02.101
let Luke know
that we're here for him,

30:02.134 --> 30:04.971
[sighs] and we love him,
and we're here to support him.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.873
You know, that's all we can do.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.240
That's what we got to be doing.

30:11.844 --> 30:12.979
-Sherm.
-Yeah?

30:13.012 --> 30:14.947
You can't smoke in here.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.916
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah, no, no.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.152
[clears throat]

30:37.669 --> 30:38.871
[car engine starts]

31:14.640 --> 31:18.577
I cannot believe
that hot old guy was
a pedo this whole time!

31:18.610 --> 31:19.979
It doesn't make any sense.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.547
He's hot.
Like, he could get
somebody his own age.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.649
-I know!
-I think you're
missing the point.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.784
-What?
-I don't know.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.854
No, 'cause, like...
It's not about
who he could get.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.057
Like, obviously
he could get girls.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.859
But he doesn't.
And that's the point.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.327
What are you
even talking about?

31:35.361 --> 31:36.395
[Erica] What?
We're trying to make
some money, dude.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.531
You can be, like,
a real fun sponge.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.469
If Luke's his type,
what makes you think
he's gonna be into you?

31:43.502 --> 31:44.403
You're not a boy.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.704
Okay, but it's 2016.

31:45.737 --> 31:49.075
Sexuality and gender
are totally fluid concepts now.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.078
Okay, so you're gonna
dress like a boy?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.313
[Kala] What? No.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.848
Look, how do you know
that he's loaded?

31:56.882 --> 32:00.186
He drives a fucking Saab, right?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.354
Saab's like a mid-range car.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.657
No, it's a European car.
It's a very nice car.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.959
Trust me.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.362
-Okay.
-Are you guys in or not?

32:11.797 --> 32:13.399
-I'm in.
-Cool. Cheers.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.544
This is good.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.379
Oh, it is good, yeah.
I was craving salad.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.455
[Laurie] Hi, honey.
Do you want me to
real quick, fix you a plate?

32:36.488 --> 32:38.424
[Bob] We've some
quinoa set up for you.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.192
I'm okay.

32:40.226 --> 32:43.129
Erica, do you think
I could speak with you
in the other room?

32:43.929 --> 32:45.397
Mm-hm, sure.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.402
Ask him if he wants me
to fix him a plate.

32:53.672 --> 32:54.740
What's up, Lukey?

32:55.707 --> 32:57.509
I wanna go
back to rehab. Can--

32:58.110 --> 33:00.012
Can you help me?

33:00.046 --> 33:01.580
Is this about Will Jordan?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.684
How do you know about that?

33:05.717 --> 33:09.655
I mean, you weren't exactly
subtle back there
at the bowling alley, dude.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.460
It doesn't matter.
The point is, I believe you.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.429
I do.
And, I'm gonna help you.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.501
Just forget I said anything.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.737
Can you scoot over?
I need this side
of the bed. Thanks.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.946
I deal with these sleazebags
on the reg, okay?
I know what goes on

33:34.980 --> 33:36.982
in this town
behind closed doors...

33:37.015 --> 33:38.384
and open doors.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.653
What do you have in mind?

33:43.422 --> 33:45.657
The way I see it,
you've got two options here.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.128
You can either
superglue your asshole shut

33:49.161 --> 33:52.564
and spend the rest of your life
running away from this guy
like a little bitch,

33:56.902 --> 33:59.205
or we can bust his pervy ass...

33:59.238 --> 34:01.740
and make the motherfucker pay!

34:04.943 --> 34:07.213
Think about it, okay?

34:07.246 --> 34:08.313
Hm.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.049
I'm taking this.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.860
So, Erica says this is like
your ex-boyfriend or something.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.329
Was it serious?

34:23.362 --> 34:26.165
Yeah, did you go all the way or
did you just make out and stuff?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.899
What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

34:27.933 --> 34:32.138
He isn't some science project
for you to analyze.
He is a human bean.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.505
-Did you say "being" or "bean?"
-Enough!

34:34.540 --> 34:36.908
Guys, nothing's even
gonna happen. Can we
please just get out of here?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.677
No! This is a stakeout.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.112
You didn't think
it actually involved
eating steak, did you?

34:41.147 --> 34:43.315
-[laughing]
-[sarcastically]
You're so funny.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.417
My mom keeps texting me.
I should probably go home soon.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.620
Nobody's going anywhere
until we see this guy
molest somebody.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.021
I don't wanna see that.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.757
What, you think he's just
gonna molest someone
right in front of us?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.659
-I don't know!
-I don't think he will.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.094
He's like a pro.
That's what you get
a subterranean dungeon for.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.062
-What?
-Yeah.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.597
Totally. Let's get out of here.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.699
I don't believe this shit.
Are you serious?

35:00.732 --> 35:03.802
You guys are bailing
on me already? We've been here
for like two seconds.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.404
Well, it's taco night.

35:05.437 --> 35:09.541
Look, shaking down
a child molester
is like our moral obligation.

35:09.575 --> 35:14.180
We're the only thing standing
between Will Jordan and
a whole town of innocent boys.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.847
If we don't act now,

35:15.881 --> 35:19.385
then other little kids might
get butt-raped
like big Lukey over here.

35:19.418 --> 35:24.456
And 15 years from now,
they'll be popping pills
and eating their feelings, too.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.625
Do you really want that
on your conscience?

35:26.658 --> 35:29.328
No, I don't--
I don't want anyone to be fat.

35:31.863 --> 35:32.864
Fuck me.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.578
[crashing]

35:46.612 --> 35:49.381
-Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.883
-I didn't see you there.
-It's my bad. Sorry.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.685
It's all right.

35:53.719 --> 35:57.088
Just wondering whose dick
I got to suck to get
some cocoa puffs around here.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.791
[laughing] Know what I mean?

35:59.825 --> 36:04.263
Well, I'm no expert,
but I would imagine
it's not in the freezer isle.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.697
You're so smart.

36:08.634 --> 36:09.701
Do I know you?

36:09.735 --> 36:11.903
-I'm sorry?
-Do you work at the mall?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.273
-The mall? No.
-Sunglass Hut?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.808
Is Sunglass Hut at the mall?

36:16.842 --> 36:18.844
-Cinnabon.
-At the mall?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.380
'Cause I don't
work at the mall.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.515
-So, can't help you.
-No, okay.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.053
-[crashing]
-Yeah?

36:28.086 --> 36:29.455
I know where I know you from.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.123
Where's that?

36:32.157 --> 36:34.125
Bowling alley!

36:34.159 --> 36:35.594
You're hot old guy.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.195
Me and my friends,
we go there all the time.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.431
We've been ogling your goodies
for, like, the last six months.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.767
-My goodies?
-Yeah.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.936
Oh, my God. Okay. Thanks.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.439
-It's a compliment.
-Great!

36:51.910 --> 36:56.648
Hey, do you mind
escorting me to the cereal isle?

36:56.682 --> 37:00.018
You want me to escort you
to the cereal isle?

37:00.051 --> 37:00.919
Please.

37:03.522 --> 37:08.093
So, do you have a job
or do you just bowl 24/7?

37:08.126 --> 37:10.629
Yeah, that's me.
Never not bowling.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.799
Actually, my buddies and I
have a league
on Wednesday nights.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.368
And you openly
tell people that?

37:16.402 --> 37:20.406
Well, I tore my ACL.
I can't play basketball.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.774
Not ready to put on
golf pants just yet.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.209
You guys have a team name?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.945
We do. The Gutter-punks.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.480
-Badass, dude.
-Okay.

37:28.514 --> 37:31.517
You know what,
we're league champs
three years running.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.851
-Cool.
-We've even had
our own shirts made.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.321
-Whoa, very cool.
-It is cool.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.856
I know, that's why I said it.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.426
Okay, what do you do for fun?

37:40.459 --> 37:43.595
Watch movies,
listen to music,
worship the devil.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.598
You know,
typical teenage shenanigans.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.668
What kind of music?
Like Justin Beiber and shit?

37:49.701 --> 37:52.070
Some shit.
Do you listen
to Andrea Bocelli?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.572
No, I like hip hop, actually.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.974
Oh, okay.
Well, Macklemore's not hip hop.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.343
Mackle-- No.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.677
[indistinct]

37:58.710 --> 38:01.313
-Stuff you've never
even heard of.
-Oh, my God.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.515
Dude, I know way more
about that shit than you do.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.083
-Yes, I do.
-Okay, who's your
favorite rapper?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.986
-Eazy-E, and may he
rest in fucking peace.
-Eazy-E. Oh, my God.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.389
It has nothing to do with that
movie that came out, does it?

38:10.422 --> 38:13.559
Oh, fuck no, okay.
I know every single lyric
to gimme that nut,

38:13.592 --> 38:16.094
-Every single lyric.
-That song is older
than you are.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.963
-Who got you into that stuff?
-My dad.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.431
Your dad?

38:19.465 --> 38:21.367
-That's pretty weird.
-What?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.735
Oh, this is your stop.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.638
-Here we are.
-Cocoa puffs.
There they are.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.711
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.349
Erica.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.519
-I'm Will.
-Hey.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.254
-All right.
-Okay.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.891
-Bye.
-Bye. See you
at the bowling alley.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.433
[phone ringing]

38:57.536 --> 38:59.371
[recording] Thank you
for using Jail Mail.

38:59.405 --> 39:03.442
-Please leave your message
for inmate-
-[Ray] Ray Vandross.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.811
-[recording] at the tone.
-[beeps]

39:05.844 --> 39:08.179
Hi, Ray. Dad.

39:08.213 --> 39:10.682
It's me. I'm just calling.
I haven't heard
from you in a minute.

39:10.716 --> 39:13.985
Uh, I'm sure you haven't called
'cause you're super busy

39:14.019 --> 39:16.788
doing whatever it is
that you do. [laughs nervously]

39:16.822 --> 39:20.025
Um... Hey, that business
that I started with my friends,

39:20.058 --> 39:21.960
I just wanna let you know,
we're killing it.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.963
And, I don't wanna
get ahead of myself,
but I think actually I might.

39:26.297 --> 39:28.900
I have enough to bail
your ass out soon, so.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.802
-so... yeah.
-[beeping]

39:30.836 --> 39:33.271
I feel like they're gonna
cut me off 'cause I hear
that beeping thing,

39:33.304 --> 39:35.474
but I love you,
and I miss you,
and...

39:35.507 --> 39:38.109
[recording] Thank you
for using Jail Mail.
Your call is now complete.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.618
[music plays indistinctly]

39:49.821 --> 39:52.658
Do you think it's weird
that Will doesn't
have a girlfriend?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.560
Why is that weird?
He's into little boys.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.962
No, but I was just thinking,
if I was a child molester,

39:56.995 --> 40:00.932
I'd for sure have like,
a hot significant other to

40:01.667 --> 40:03.502
cover my tracks and alibi.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.971
You think he's hot?

40:06.004 --> 40:08.807
I don't think he's hot.
He's a fucking pedophile.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.678
Granted...

40:12.711 --> 40:14.746
He does have
a banging ass dad-bod,

40:14.780 --> 40:16.615
but, I mean,
I don't wanna marry the dude.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.586
You've been scrolling
through his photos for
the past hour and a half.

40:20.619 --> 40:24.523
I'm looking for clues.
Don't be so fucking weird.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.424
I'm trying to help you.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.760
I never asked
for your help, Erica.

40:28.794 --> 40:33.532
Unfortunately, you don't
really have a say in the matter.
We're vigilantes, okay.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.200
What would Batman
and Robin do

40:35.233 --> 40:37.603
if they saw the Joker
sticking his finger up
little boys' assholes?

40:37.636 --> 40:41.473
Batman wouldn't be talking
about Joker's banging dad-bod.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.809
Yeah, but Robin would.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.877
[both laughing]

40:47.112 --> 40:48.780
-I know your secret.
-What?

40:49.648 --> 40:50.916
You're jealous.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.586
-I'm not jealous.
-Yes, you are.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.254
-You're jealous.
You think that--
-No, I'm not.

40:56.287 --> 41:00.225
-You think that I like Will
and it's eating you up inside.
-No.

41:00.258 --> 41:04.229
I'm not fucking jealous
of you wanting to date
a child molester.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.664
I know you want
a piece of this.

41:05.697 --> 41:09.267
Your mouth has like
10,000 venereal diseases, so...

41:09.300 --> 41:11.036
[Erica laughs] Oh!

41:12.303 --> 41:14.005
I love this song!

41:15.240 --> 41:17.175
Makes me feel like dancing.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.544
[rap song plays indistinctly]

41:19.845 --> 41:21.513
You wanna see me dance, Luke?

41:21.547 --> 41:23.949
No, I don't.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.116
Are you sure?

41:30.288 --> 41:31.322
What?

41:31.356 --> 41:32.457
I don't.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.925
It's so fun though.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.062
I guess.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.129
Do you know this song?

41:39.865 --> 41:41.633
[both laugh]

41:41.667 --> 41:43.602
Come dance with me.

41:43.635 --> 41:46.204
No? It's a good song.

41:47.639 --> 41:50.241
Do you like that?
One of those?

41:50.275 --> 41:51.943
I don't wanna dance by myself.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.546
It's kinda embarrassing.
Come dance with me.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.782
-I can't.
-Come dance.

41:56.815 --> 42:00.786
Do you like when I do that?
What about like [grunts]

42:02.220 --> 42:03.521
I-- No.

42:03.555 --> 42:06.658
No? Have you ever
danced with a girl before?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.293
Come on,
you know the answer to that.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.261
Please.

42:10.295 --> 42:11.529
I don't like this music.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.733
Oh, I don't like this music.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.201
I'll play different music.
Come on.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.637
Come here!

42:18.670 --> 42:20.972
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

42:27.312 --> 42:28.847
[music plays
softly over earphones]

42:30.248 --> 42:31.717
Are you excited
to dance with me?

42:33.351 --> 42:34.653
We'll see.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.722
[Luke chuckles]

42:36.755 --> 42:40.391
-Come on.
-You listen to
this kind of music?

42:40.425 --> 42:43.061
-What do you mean?
-Never thought you'd be
into music like this.

42:43.094 --> 42:46.331
It just came up on--
I didn't pick it.

42:46.364 --> 42:47.866
I saw you double click on it.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.268
Fuck off, dude.
Just dance with me.
Don't be such a dick.

42:58.644 --> 42:59.945
[Erica] Look at me!

43:01.947 --> 43:02.881
Look at me.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.284
Just that...

43:06.317 --> 43:08.920
You're like, squeezing onto
a fucking giant airplane
right now.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.960
You're pretty hard on yourself.

43:18.463 --> 43:21.599
You can grab me.
I'm not gonna break.

43:25.103 --> 43:30.676
* I lost my dream
I lost my reason all again *

43:35.747 --> 43:38.850
* It's not just me for you

43:38.884 --> 43:41.820
* I have to look out too

43:41.853 --> 43:44.923
* I have to save my life

43:44.956 --> 43:47.926
* I need some peace of mind

43:47.959 --> 43:50.929
* I am the only one now

43:50.962 --> 43:54.065
* I am the only one now

43:54.099 --> 43:57.002
* I am the only one now

43:57.035 --> 44:00.005
* You may not be around

44:00.038 --> 44:02.708
* You may not be around

44:05.711 --> 44:07.412
[hip hop music playing]

44:13.051 --> 44:15.320
-[whispers] Hi!
-Oh, Jesus!

44:15.353 --> 44:18.056
-You scared the shit out of me.
-I'm sorry.

44:18.089 --> 44:19.825
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-Yeah.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.794
I forgot that guys your age
have a higher risk
of stroke and heart failure.

44:27.699 --> 44:30.201
Are you gonna teach me
how to bowl or what?

44:30.235 --> 44:32.904
You hang out here and
you don't know how to bowl?

44:32.938 --> 44:36.307
Yeah, I'm in high school, idiot.
What else am I gonna do?

44:36.341 --> 44:37.809
Well, maybe another time.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.211
I was hoping to get in
a few frames before they close.

44:40.245 --> 44:41.980
[using nasal voice]
My name is Will

44:42.013 --> 44:44.382
and I was hoping to get in
a few extra frames
before they close.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.252
Come on.

44:52.123 --> 44:53.058
All right.

44:54.325 --> 44:55.794
[groaning]

44:55.827 --> 45:00.098
All right, straighten your wrist
and point your thumb
at the center pin there.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.703
[grunts]

45:08.706 --> 45:10.208
Not bad.

45:10.241 --> 45:12.744
That ball was
way too heavy for me.

45:12.778 --> 45:15.113
Well, let's get you
a lighter ball then.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.050
Here you go.

45:19.084 --> 45:22.320
Now, you want
to roll the ball.
You don't throw the ball.

45:22.353 --> 45:23.254
Okay?

45:24.155 --> 45:25.490
So, I'm gonna
have to adjust you.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.058
You need to...

45:29.194 --> 45:33.899
You have to
square your hips, okay?

45:34.966 --> 45:36.701
Ready?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.937
Now you're gonna
take some steps here.

45:38.970 --> 45:42.373
Now step forward,
while pulling your arm back.

45:42.407 --> 45:45.977
Now, swing your arm forward,
lower your hips,

45:46.011 --> 45:47.345
keep stepping forward.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.915
Ready?

45:52.717 --> 45:53.852
I got them! [whooping]

45:54.719 --> 45:56.121
-See? Good.
-Did you see that?

45:56.154 --> 45:58.056
-I did it.
-See, you did it right.

45:58.089 --> 46:01.192
What do I win?
My part in the Gutter-bunks?
Can I have a shirt?

46:01.226 --> 46:04.262
Well, you win
a series of points
up there on the board.

46:04.295 --> 46:07.365
-I don't get a prize?
-You don't win an object.

46:07.398 --> 46:09.167
But you get... See...

46:09.200 --> 46:12.037
There you go.
That's your score.
That's yours.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.205
I thought this was
like Skee-ball for losers.

46:14.239 --> 46:16.007
Why the fuck
does anyone play this?

46:17.475 --> 46:19.544
It's a good question.

46:19.577 --> 46:21.146
Let's go play arcade games.

46:30.155 --> 46:31.089
[rain pouring]

46:31.122 --> 46:32.623
[Kala] What do you think
is happening in there?

46:32.657 --> 46:36.194
[Claudine] I don't know.
I'm hungry. Let's go eat steak.

46:38.897 --> 46:40.531
-[mock screams]
-[groans]

46:41.867 --> 46:43.001
What the fuck?

46:43.034 --> 46:45.971
Whoa! Oh, my God, we got him!

46:46.972 --> 46:50.208
Okay, well, it was fun
hanging with you.

46:51.176 --> 46:53.011
You're not gonna
drop me off at home.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.546
Why would I do that?

46:55.580 --> 47:00.118
Don't you know what happens
to 17 year old girls who walk
home alone at night in the rain?

47:00.151 --> 47:04.689
If I get kidnapped
and trapped in some guy's
basement for 30 years,

47:04.722 --> 47:06.257
-totally your fault.
-All right, okay.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.626
-I'm serious.
-All right, all right, okay.

47:08.659 --> 47:09.694
Okay.

47:09.727 --> 47:10.828
-You ready?
-Yup.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.797
Okay, here we go.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.933
-Two...
-Okay, you go first,
you go first.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.902
-Three.
-Three! [screams]

47:16.935 --> 47:18.103
Oh, my God.

47:18.136 --> 47:20.838
Shit, where's my phone?
Got it.

47:20.872 --> 47:24.175
Oh, my God.
Hurry up.
It's so cold!

47:25.676 --> 47:26.577
[Erica] Fuck.

47:28.546 --> 47:29.780
Oh, my God.

47:29.814 --> 47:31.082
Fuck!

47:31.116 --> 47:32.450
Oh, man!

47:32.483 --> 47:34.285
Like, what!

47:34.319 --> 47:38.723
-Good lord.
-Can you turn on the heat?

47:38.756 --> 47:41.226
-Oh, shit, it's fucking...
-It'll warm up. It'll warm up.

47:42.827 --> 47:45.997
[Claudine] Kala, can you
scrub the window?
I can't see shit.

47:51.536 --> 47:52.470
Oh.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.473
[rain pattering]

47:58.176 --> 48:00.678
Are you okay?
You seem really tense.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.181
No, I'm good.
Yeah, yeah.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.315
Cool.

48:08.753 --> 48:10.088
Oh, God.

48:13.791 --> 48:16.027
-Are you cold?
-Yeah, a little.

48:19.464 --> 48:21.032
It's kinda gross, but...

48:21.066 --> 48:22.400
Oh, it's okay.
I don't need that.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.669
It'll do the trick.
Here. Here!

48:45.690 --> 48:47.158
[Claudine] What the fuck!

48:47.192 --> 48:48.659
Why's she doing that?

48:48.693 --> 48:50.861
-[Kala] Do you see this?
-[Claudine] She's like
totally into it.

48:50.895 --> 48:52.530
She's making out with him.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.071
-Hey, hey, hey, hey--
-Sorry.

49:00.938 --> 49:03.241
I'm sorry.
I was-- That didn't--

49:04.042 --> 49:05.543
I just freaked out.
I don't...

49:12.083 --> 49:13.351
What are you doing?

49:13.384 --> 49:15.020
-What are you doing?
-Giving you a blowjob.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.554
-Stop it!
-Whoa!

49:21.726 --> 49:24.295
Here, I'll call you a cab
and get you out of here.

49:24.329 --> 49:26.164
-I don't want--
-Just take all of this.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.933
Oh, you really know how to
make a girl feel special.
I can find my own way home.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.168
Asshole.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.042
What was that all about?

49:44.882 --> 49:47.785
Dude, what happened back there?
Like, you were about to close.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.154
That was super weird.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.456
I literally don't know
what that perv's deal was.

49:51.489 --> 49:54.659
Everything was going
according to plan, and then
he just got weird with me.

49:54.692 --> 49:57.095
You were making out like
you were on a date in his Saab.

49:57.128 --> 49:59.530
I've never seen you
do anything like that before.

49:59.564 --> 50:01.232
Probably 'cause
she's in love with him.

50:02.067 --> 50:04.169
Fuck you.
I am not.

50:04.202 --> 50:05.670
[Erica] He kissed me.

50:05.703 --> 50:07.272
-You kept kissing him
after he kissed you.
-No, I stopped!

50:07.305 --> 50:09.607
He freaked out.
He was being fucking weird.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.708
I agree.

50:10.741 --> 50:13.278
Okay, so then,
what's the plan?
I want our money.

50:15.413 --> 50:17.415
What if we break in
and tie him up?

50:17.448 --> 50:20.085
Cool... Like dom him.
Like he's out little bitch.

50:20.118 --> 50:21.686
I like that a lot.

50:21.719 --> 50:25.623
What if we slip
some drugs in his food
while he's not looking?

50:25.656 --> 50:28.526
That's a good idea.
Drugs... Like what drugs?

50:28.559 --> 50:30.128
Roofies?

50:30.161 --> 50:31.429
That's a fucking great idea.

50:31.462 --> 50:33.931
-That is a horrible idea.
-We can roofie him.

50:33.964 --> 50:37.335
knock his ass out, right.
So then, once he's out,

50:37.368 --> 50:39.470
we all strip down, not you,

50:39.504 --> 50:43.874
take some sexy pictures, and
then extort his ass for cash.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.743
Like literally, like, yeah.

50:45.776 --> 50:48.179
But, who do we know
has roofies?

50:49.747 --> 50:50.815
[whistle blows]

51:23.414 --> 51:24.282
[gargling]

51:47.438 --> 51:50.275
[Erica] All right.
Here you go,
just a little bit.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.009
-Okay.
-Just a little.

51:52.042 --> 51:54.011
-Just a little.
-Easy...

51:54.044 --> 51:55.180
-That's not a little.
-Jesus!

51:55.213 --> 51:56.447
-What? Sorry.
-It's too much.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.449
He's not gonna
drink the whole thing now.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.489
-Okay.
-Go get him, my girl.

52:04.955 --> 52:06.257
Wish me luck.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.592
-Bye.
-Okay.

52:09.594 --> 52:11.162
[music intensifies]

52:29.947 --> 52:31.316
[knocking on door]

52:36.153 --> 52:38.055
Surprise! [laughs nervously]

52:38.088 --> 52:39.524
What are you doing here?

52:39.557 --> 52:41.292
I'm not stalking you
or anything.

52:41.326 --> 52:43.261
I just--
I came by
to say I'm sorry.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.296
It got weird
the other night and, uh...

52:46.331 --> 52:47.798
I didn't bring your sweatshirt.

52:48.999 --> 52:54.272
Um, as you can probably tell,
I have major daddy issues.

52:54.839 --> 52:56.574
Yeah, um...

52:56.607 --> 53:01.312
You know what,
I feel like I'm actually
the one who should apologize.

53:01.346 --> 53:03.381
I never should have put you
in that position.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.450
-Well, that's...
-We're both sorry.
-So...

53:05.483 --> 53:07.685
Let's start over, as friends.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.956
Yeah, sure. Why not?

53:11.989 --> 53:13.958
I got you a dope-ass mix.

53:13.991 --> 53:17.194
Thought maybe I could
bring your music tastes
into the 2000s.

53:17.228 --> 53:18.496
Fingers crossed.

53:19.597 --> 53:20.698
Dope-ass mix?

53:21.366 --> 53:24.201
You gonna let me in or...

53:25.870 --> 53:27.405
-What?
-I...

53:27.438 --> 53:31.175
I don't think that's
the greatest idea, Erica.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.844
Come on.
One beer to bury the hatchet.

53:37.648 --> 53:40.050
One beer, then I'll go. Promise.

53:40.084 --> 53:41.719
All right.

53:41.752 --> 53:44.522
Just one beer
and I gotta like...

53:44.555 --> 53:46.190
Well, fucking have half a beer.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.858
-Half a beer.
-Half a beer, okay.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.194
Where should--
Do you have a fridge
that I could...

53:50.227 --> 53:52.463
-Yeah, right in the--
-Nice house.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.101
Where's your bottle opener?

53:57.134 --> 53:59.003
The drawer to the right
of the stove.

54:00.371 --> 54:01.572
[Erica] Found it!

54:02.940 --> 54:04.542
[slow music plays]

54:11.316 --> 54:12.550
[Erica] Here you go.

54:14.184 --> 54:16.253
Cheers.

54:19.624 --> 54:22.727
If anyone asks, you did not
get that from me, okay?

54:24.161 --> 54:25.363
Okay, Dad.

54:26.931 --> 54:31.302
Okay, speaking of...
Do your parents
ever wonder where you are?

54:32.370 --> 54:34.238
Not really, no.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.508
My mom's busy with
her new boyfriend
and my dad's in jail.

54:39.510 --> 54:40.945
How did he get there?

54:42.513 --> 54:45.483
He got caught
being awesome in a casino.

54:45.516 --> 54:47.718
He should be getting out
any day now, though.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.361
You know,
my dad wasn't
really around either.

54:57.662 --> 54:59.764
Seems like no one
stays together anymore.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.900
I'll drink to that.

55:04.201 --> 55:05.302
No?

55:07.271 --> 55:08.806
[music continues
playing on stereo]

55:11.241 --> 55:13.411
Who's that? Sister?

55:15.312 --> 55:18.383
Uh, that is my ex-wife, Brenda.

55:25.590 --> 55:27.925
I propose a new toast.

55:27.958 --> 55:31.028
"People sticking together."
What do you think?

55:31.061 --> 55:32.463
[Will] Sure, I'll drink to that.

55:33.631 --> 55:35.199
[Erica] Okay, here we go.

55:35.232 --> 55:36.534
[bottles clink]

55:47.478 --> 55:49.547
Hm, beer's kinda skunky.

55:50.981 --> 55:53.418
Yeah, it's the only beer
I could afford.

55:53.451 --> 55:55.420
It's gonna taste like piss.

55:55.453 --> 55:56.987
Where did you get this?

55:57.021 --> 55:58.288
Ninety-nine cent store.

55:58.322 --> 55:59.724
-Really?
-I'm sorry.

55:59.757 --> 56:02.026
You can't get beer
at the 99 cent store.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.828
-I can and I did.
-Geez.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.669
What, are you going
to Paris or some shit?

56:11.702 --> 56:15.339
That was given to me
by the aforementioned Brenda.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.007
Why the fuck
would you keep it?

56:17.775 --> 56:19.510
To remind me
how much I hate her.

56:20.244 --> 56:21.912
Just kidding. Kind of.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.450
Why'd you split up?

56:25.850 --> 56:26.917
[sighs]

56:26.951 --> 56:30.187
That is a... long story.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.957
-We got nothing but time.
-No.

56:35.259 --> 56:36.561
Complicated.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.730
Man, come on, tell me.

56:39.764 --> 56:41.932
You can't say it's complicated
and not tell me.

56:44.034 --> 56:47.404
[laughs] Uh...

56:47.438 --> 56:51.976
Well, a few years ago,
I was teaching middle school
in Woodland Pines.

56:52.009 --> 56:55.580
You were-- That's...
A teacher? Okay, I didn't know
that you were a teacher.

56:55.613 --> 56:58.415
Yeah, I was also
girl's basketball coach.

56:59.049 --> 57:00.217
Oh.

57:00.250 --> 57:03.287
Regional champs,
three year running.
Go, Roadrunners!

57:03.320 --> 57:04.755
So, what happened?

57:04.789 --> 57:07.091
-Why'd you stop?
-Well, I got fired.

57:10.995 --> 57:13.698
Some fucking punk...

57:15.065 --> 57:17.134
accused me of molesting him.

57:19.136 --> 57:20.705
-Wow.
-Yeah.

57:21.539 --> 57:24.074
You would be shocked

57:24.108 --> 57:26.276
what a molestation accusation

57:26.310 --> 57:28.946
does to a
perfectly fine marriage.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.583
Did you do it?

57:34.519 --> 57:36.654
No, I didn't do it.
Of course, not.

57:38.255 --> 57:41.391
Kid was a pathological liar.

57:41.425 --> 57:43.193
He never even got
his story straight.

57:43.227 --> 57:47.965
It was like a desperate cry
for attention or something.

57:49.266 --> 57:51.101
-That's messed up.
-Yeah.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.037
Yeah, it is.

57:53.070 --> 57:56.006
And the fucking...
The judge threw
the whole case out.

57:56.040 --> 58:00.645
I mean, he had no evidence.
But still, I lose my job,

58:00.678 --> 58:04.949
I lose my wife.
I lose my fucking dog.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.416
My dog!

58:06.450 --> 58:09.654
She never walked that dog.
I walked that dog.

58:09.687 --> 58:12.590
Any idea what it's like
to walk around

58:13.023 --> 58:16.927
in 100% shame

58:16.961 --> 58:21.365
seven days a week,
365 days a year,

58:21.398 --> 58:24.101
I am a fucking nobody.

58:25.002 --> 58:29.239
So now,
I'm in this house by myself.

58:29.273 --> 58:31.576
And you know,

58:32.943 --> 58:37.848
what, I'm drinking terrible beer
with a 17-year-old.

58:37.882 --> 58:40.117
I mean no offense,
but... Jesus!

58:44.088 --> 58:45.590
[sarcastically]
My life is awesome.

58:46.824 --> 58:49.694
Dude, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.796
[bottle shatters]
Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry.

58:51.829 --> 58:53.130
[Erica] I don't know
why I did that.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.865
I must have
tourette's or something.
Are you okay?

58:54.899 --> 58:56.466
-[screams]
-What are you doing?

58:56.500 --> 58:58.368
-I don't really--
-What's going on?

58:58.402 --> 59:00.470
-Dude, stop.
-What did you do?

59:00.504 --> 59:01.772
-Fuck!
-What did you do?

59:01.806 --> 59:02.940
[Erica] My friends and I thought
you were a pedophile

59:02.973 --> 59:04.308
so we were gonna drug you
and take your money,

59:04.341 --> 59:06.744
-but it was
one big misunderstanding.
-What did you do?

59:06.777 --> 59:08.512
-I'm sorry.
-What did you do?

59:08.545 --> 59:09.880
[screams]

59:11.048 --> 59:12.683
[Erica] What the fuck?

59:12.717 --> 59:14.585
What just happened?

59:14.619 --> 59:17.121
-You were in trouble.
-I don't know if I was.

59:17.154 --> 59:18.488
[shrieking]

59:18.522 --> 59:19.790
Oh, my God, look at him.

59:19.824 --> 59:21.225
I mean, he's really fucked up.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.962
Okay, let's pick him up.

59:24.995 --> 59:28.065
Erica, snap out of it.
Come on!

59:30.067 --> 59:31.168
[groaning]

59:31.201 --> 59:33.170
-Ow!
-Jesus!

59:33.971 --> 59:35.205
Oh, my God.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.340
Okay, yeah that's good.

59:38.843 --> 59:40.010
All right, let's do this.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.912
Okay, Luke,
take five over there.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.313
Corner.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.855
-Got your phone?
-Got it.

59:51.956 --> 59:54.591
Put it in...
Like on your tits or something.

59:54.625 --> 59:55.993
Yeah, like that.

59:56.026 --> 59:59.096
Yeah, that's good.
Gorgeous. I love it.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.097
Sit next to him.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:02.767
Yeah, get on top of him.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.271
I like that.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:08.605
Yeah, touch each other.

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:09.974
Like that, perfect.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:13.010
You look so into it.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.345
Can you see his face?

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.613
A little bit up.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.115
Yeah.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.185
You get it?

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.020
No, I'm trying
to find the right filter.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.789
Dude, just take
the fucking picture.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.623
All right, bitch.
I'm trying to make
you look good.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.993
[Erica] Take the picture!

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.895
Perfect, we got it.
That's it.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.263
Let's get out of here.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.903
Wait, we're just gonna
leave him like that?

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.905
Let's just-- Let's just
get out of here. Come on.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.007
Let's just-- Luke, let's just
get out of here.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.475
Guys, his breathing
is really shallow.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:46.777
What do you mean?

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.848
-How much did he drink?
-Not that much.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:54.451
[Kala] You guys, come on,
seriously, we're leaving.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.187
He just needs to
sleep it off, dude.
He'll be fine by the morning.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.090
Plenty of people
take roofies recreationally.

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:03.160
-No. That's not right.
-Yes.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:05.129
Dude, you said
he was a child molester.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.197
He raped you
and he got away with it.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:09.133
So...

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:12.669
Right?

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.138
Yeah.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.941
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:22.546
Okay, so what's our alibi?

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.514
We were at my house
watching Netflix,
then making a vision board.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.283
-Okay.
-Hey, what should
we do with that?

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.651
What the fuck is that shit?

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.019
-That was not
part of the plan!
-We got bored!

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.888
-Oh, my God.
-We thought it was funny.

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:38.929
[birds chirping]

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.180
[car approaching]

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:01.051
[doorbell rings]

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:09.726
[knock at door]

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:14.799
Uh, the police are here.
They wanna have
a word with you.

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.466
I'm sleeping.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.968
There's cops here, Erica.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.270
I'm tired.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:22.472
Get up. Get up.

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:24.909
[Laurie screaming] This is not
fucking around time!

01:02:27.011 --> 01:02:28.879
-[Erica] Jesus!
-[Laurie] Sorry, Bob.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:33.117
-Bob, get out of my room.
-I'm sorry.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.555
All right, here she is.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.224
She's agreed to cooperate.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.092
-Miss Vandross.
-[Laurie] Sit down.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:47.832
[Dale] Have a seat, please.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.435
We just wanna
ask a few questions.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.303
Okay.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:54.438
Where were you last night?

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.073
With my friends.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.741
Doing what?

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.609
Buying tampons.
Like, what's it to you?

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:01.145
-[sighs]
-Erica.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:04.381
Well, the reason we're asking is
there's a man named Will Jordan

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.384
who had his garage vandalized.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.888
His neighbor said
she saw a heavy-set young man,

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:14.424
and a girl
who fit your description
leaving the scene of the crime.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.093
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:18.628
What?

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.364
What did Will Jordan say to you?

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:22.799
We don't know what he said.
We haven't been
able to contact him yet.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.538
How about you, big guy?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.608
You have anything
you want to tell me?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.845
Now Luke, just tell
the officer what's going on.

01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:36.346
Did she make you
do anything, sweetheart?

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.282
[clicks tongue] Nope.

01:03:39.884 --> 01:03:41.852
So, is that it?

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:44.721
Yup, but just know,
we will be back.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.656
Vandalism is
a very serious crime.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.093
[Bob] Absolutely.
We got an open line here.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.060
Let's go.

01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:51.628
Whatever we can
do to help, we're here

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.097
-to support you.
-Thank you, sir.

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:54.298
Thank you.

01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:59.569
[whispers] Maybe we should go
and make sure he's okay.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.338
[door shuts]

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:04.308
-Erica, okay...
-Hi.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.345
-Oh, honey.
-What? What's wrong?

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.215
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:12.983
No.

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:17.487
Are you gonna
just stand there
and lie to my face?

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.056
I'm not lying to you.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.625
I have no idea
what he's fucking talking about.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.160
Erica...

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.362
I'm gonna give you
one more try.
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.131
-Nothing--
-There, you just did it again.

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:28.798
-You just lied
right in my face again.
-[Erica] No, I didn't.

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:31.501
[Laurie] I have been
swallowing so much
of your bullshit for so long.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:32.903
-So long!
-But--

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:34.404
You're just gonna
stand here and fucking
lie right to my face.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.306
This is not part of
the fucking deal that we made!

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.843
I am not lying to you.
I am not fucking lying to you.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.179
Hey! You don't
talk to your mother that way.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.982
Oh, no, no, no.
So, you guys are
teaming up behind my back?

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.650
Yeah, yeah.
'Cause I need fucking help.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.752
[screaming] 'Cause I can't
do this by myself anymore!

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:51.956
[screaming] You do not get to
fucking team up on me.
You do not get to do that.

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:54.824
You're just here
to fuck my mom
and eat our food,

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:56.593
-and I don't
fucking like it anymore.
-Hey!

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:58.162
-I'm sorry, Bob.
-What the fuck is that shit?

01:04:58.195 --> 01:05:00.397
You can talk to me
that way all day long,

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.466
but I'm not gonna have you
talk to your mom that way,
you hear me?

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:05.069
You don't fucking parent me.
You are not my father, dude.

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:07.938
Your dad fucking left
and I got to do it by myself.

01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:10.674
I got to do it
fucking by myself,
and I fucked up.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.476
I obviously fucked up.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:16.080
I don't know what to do.
I have given it all to you.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:20.217
[screaming] I cannot hold on
to anybody 'cause
you scare them all away!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.351
Everybody!

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:24.388
You're just a cruel,
fucking, selfish twat!

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:36.300
You have scared away
every man that has ever
shown any interest in me.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.437
And you cannot
do it with this one.
I won't let you.

01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:43.240
'Cause he's good.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.014
I'm done. I'm done.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.316
[hurting] Thank you.

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.284
Thank you for everything, Mom.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.625
I can't.
I just can't.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.331
Laurie, baby...

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.033
[Bob] Are you all right?

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.734
[fake laughs] Stupid.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.306
You coming?

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.655
What are we even
gonna say to him?

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.157
I don't fucking know.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.260
"Sorry for drugging you.
Here's your sweatshirt."

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.101
[Erica] Will?

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:46.503
Will?

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:01.418
Will?

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:06.656
Will?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.294
Oh, my God.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:20.704
[Erica] Do you feel anything?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.409
[shrieks]

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:29.613
[Luke sputters] Okay...

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.216
[gasping]

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:33.783
Erica...

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.492
[exhales]

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:46.596
[whispers] What do we...

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.633
What the fuck do we do?

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.201
We're so fucked.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.403
Um...

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:55.372
Let's, uh...

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.473
Um...

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.611
What are you doing?

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:03.647
-I'm getting us out of here.
-You're stealing his car?

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.383
It's only a matter of time
before the cops
figure out who did this, Erica.

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.887
Okay, so what about
Kala and Claudine?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.822
We're just gonna leave them?
We're just gonna go?

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:14.291
Claudine's gonna sell you out.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.160
She's never gonna
hold up under questioning.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:21.631
What about our parents?
Like, what about my fucking mom?

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.899
You can send them a letter
once we've made it to Mexico.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.835
Mexico?

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.970
You sound like a psycho, Luke.

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.738
Erica, look at me.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:33.176
You're getting in this car,
and we're going. Now!

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:35.679
[door shuts]

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.814
[grave music playing]

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:44.754
[knocking on door]

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.157
Hey, mama,
are you in there?

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.260
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:53.729
Lady?

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:57.901
You know what,
I'm just gonna come in.
I'm sorry, I'm busting.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.470
[birds chirping]

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.278
Bob, honey...

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:12.782
Have you seen--

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.451
Wait, Bob?

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.390
What the fuck, Bob?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:22.792
Honey, what...

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.407
Oh, my God!

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.916
So, you say
your son was in rehab?

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.752
That's correct.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.118
Okay, for about how long?

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.154
[sighs] About a year,
give or take.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.524
Okay, now,
in the letter he says

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:57.026
"he kidnapped your daughter
and was running away to Mexico."

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.697
Do either or you
know anyone in Mexico?

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.333
Uh, well...

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:05.735
There's a cleaning lady
that comes every other week.

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:07.571
Uh, her name's...

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:10.440
-I don't think that's
what he-- No.
-Rita.

01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:13.042
Um, was there anything
missing from the house?

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:15.379
Any jewelry or valuables?

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:17.180
Her clothes, a lot...

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.449
[stammering]
She took some of here...

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:23.887
of her cute clothes,
and she has a notebook...

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:26.956
-and her pet rat.
-Yeah.

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:32.296
Just so I'm sure I understand.
They came in,

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:33.963
took the rodent
and the notebook,

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:36.500
trashed the kitchen,
and took off.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:40.169
[clears throat] Uh,
full disclosure
on the mess here,

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:42.372
uh, I smashed up the kitchen.

01:10:42.406 --> 01:10:44.874
I read the note and
just started punching stuff.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:48.678
Head up, guys.
We got a 10-54 down the street.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.382
What the hell's a 10-54?

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.759
[Erica] It's okay, it's okay.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.261
[muttering continuously]

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:18.675
[Erica] I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:22.178 --> 01:11:24.748
I don't understand
how this happened.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.450
We were just
gonna take pictures.

01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:31.721
[Luke] The whole thing
was an accident.

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.524
It wasn't murder.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:39.929
Will deserved it.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.399
Right?

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.168
You tell me
that he deserved it.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.636
Yes!

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.738
Yes. [hesitantly]
Ab-- Absolutely.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.344
I mean, I guess so. I...

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:56.846
What do you mean,
"I guess so"?

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.951
[vomiting]

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.024
[coughing]

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.325
Are you okay?

01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:13.397
No. I'm not okay.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.500
I'm obviously not okay.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:21.070
Are you okay?
Are you a sociopath?

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:26.910
You lied to me,
and an innocent man
is fucking dead 'cause of us!

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:30.046
Listen, we can't stay here.
We got to go.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.482
Oh, no, no, no.
There's no-- There's no...

01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:36.152
There's no "We"
in this anymore.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.822
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.858
I didn't lie--
I didn't lie.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.693
Okay, I did. It's--

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:46.430
-It's complicated, Erica.
-Complicated?

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.932
Did he touch your dick or not?

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:49.766
He didn't touch me.

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.701
I saw him touching
someone else!

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.037
That's the fucking truth.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.479
There...

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.415
There was this girl
at my school...

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:09.853
She must have been 12...

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.188
maybe 13.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.591
I was going back
to get a textbook,

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.159
and I saw him...

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.762
He had his hand...

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.232
He was--
He was a bad guy, Erica.

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:24.801
He was a fucking creep.

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.006
I was the only person who knew.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.741
And...

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:33.610
she was scared.

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.779
She was really scared.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.682
She didn't wanna tell anyone.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.351
I was invisible.

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.020
No one knew me.

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:46.823
It's not like
I had a ton of friends.

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:49.726
Figured if, even if it didn't
happen to me, I could...

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:54.564
keep it from happening
to someone else.
I don't know.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.102
You probably hate me
but that's the truth.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:05.575
I don't hate you.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:16.119
I just puked.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.453
I don't care.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:22.025
[riveting music plays]

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.124
Where are we?

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.195
Oh.

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:40.870
[door opens]

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.076
How did you know
where he was?

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:51.314
So, I kinda went through
your notebook.

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:52.849
last night when you were asleep.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.652
-Oh.
-Figured you might wanna

01:15:55.685 --> 01:15:57.754
pick him up
on our way to Mexico.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:02.058
Okay... How do you expect?
We don't have enough money.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.860
We didn't get
the rest of the money.

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:13.870
Holy shit!
Where did you get this, Lukey?

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:18.942
Sherm was saving up
for a new Les Paul
or something stupid.

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:22.746
This is Sherm's?
He's gonna fucking kill you.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:24.413
Oh, well, you know.

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:26.983
-Oh, my God.
-Live and let die.

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.251
[both laughing]

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.789
Okay!

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.726
[muttering excitedly]

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.527
I look like shit.
Do I look like shit?

01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:40.096
-No, you look great.
-Yeah?

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:40.997
Uh-huh.

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.366
Thank you.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.102
You're welcome.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.104
-Go.
-Okay, I am.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:02.719
Next.

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:06.055
-Hello.
-Can I help you?

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:08.057
Yes, I'm here
to bail out my old man.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.393
Are you a
licensed bail bondsman?

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:11.627
Shit, no, I'm his daughter.

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:14.063
-Cash or check?
-Cash.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:16.299
-Last name?
-Do you want me
to give you the cash now?

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:18.234
Hold on to that.
Last name?

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:20.970
Vandross.
V-A-N-D-R-O-S-S.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.371
Vandross, mm-hm.

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:27.243
Is that Raymond Vandross?

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.980
Well, it says here he was
released three days ago.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:37.954
Nope. That's not possible.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.655
Well, it says it right here.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.593
Did he leave a number?

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:46.763
Did he say
where he was going or...

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.765
Could you tell me who--
Who bailed him out?

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:51.167
Well, I'm not allowed to release
that kind of information.

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:56.706
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:00.777
Next.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:08.517
Hey, that was fast.
How'd it go?

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:10.053
Fucking awesome.

01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:12.221
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.760
It's fucking awesome.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.327
[Luke] Well, is he coming?

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.596
Uh, he's gonna come later.
He's gonna meet up with us...

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:21.998
in a bit.

01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:27.003
All right, let's go.

01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:29.906
Okay.

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:35.779
Are you sure
everything's okay?

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:38.281
-You all right?
-Yes. Everything's great.

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:42.952
Let's go.

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.854
Why you being weird?

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.224
If anything happened,
you can talk to me about it.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.193
No. I said I'm fine.

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.431
All right. Okay.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.835
[sniffling]

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.509

[melancholic music plays]

01:19:57.827 --> 01:19:59.062
You know what?

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:01.564
Fuck this shit.

01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:04.300
Fuck Mexico.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.937
Fuck my dad.

01:20:08.838 --> 01:20:10.139
Let's go home.

01:20:12.075 --> 01:20:14.210
I mean it.
I don't wanna run.

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:17.646
I don't wanna spend
the rest of our lives
looking over our shoulder

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.316
every five minutes,
and living in fear.
I wanna go home.

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:24.988
We can make up
some story to explain
why we did what we did.

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.990
We can figure that out.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:28.524
But, I want us to go home.

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:33.029
[Luke] Okay, let's go home.

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.212
[police siren approaching]

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.489
-[Erica] Do you think
that's for us?
-[Luke] Yeah, I think so.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.459
Okay, can this thing
go any faster?

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:09.732
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:11.300
Should I pull over?

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:13.602
Do you understand
if they catch us
before we turn ourselves in,

01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:15.571
we are fucked!

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.506
[siren continues blaring]

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:21.110
-What do you want me to do?
-I don't know.

01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:24.280
I don't know
what the fuck to do.
Go faster. Just go faster.

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:26.382
[Luke] I'm going as fast
as this fucking thing can go!

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:29.418
Fuck!

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.888
Luke, turn here, turn here.

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:40.329
[Luke] I think we lost him.

01:21:40.964 --> 01:21:43.399
-Do you see him?
-Okay.

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.006
Erica, I need to
tell you something.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:51.807
Okay, well,
now's not really
the fucking time.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.643
I know, I know.
But I don't know when's
the next chance I'm gonna get

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:55.979
-to tell you this.
-No, Luke.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:58.247
I think you're funny
and you're cool.

01:21:58.281 --> 01:22:00.283
-All right, Luke...
-And delicate,

01:22:00.316 --> 01:22:02.885
When I'm with you,
I just don't wanna
be anywhere else.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.954
What? What?

01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:07.556
I'm not good
at things like this, but...

01:22:08.891 --> 01:22:10.126
I think I love you.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:14.663
I love you.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:20.036
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-No!

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:21.570
I seriously fucking love you.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:27.443
Fuck it!

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:58.674
[Erica]
Can I tell you something?

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:00.643
[Luke] Sure.

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:06.249
[Erica] Okay. I've never
actually done that before.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:08.551
-[Luke] Really?
-[Erica] Yeah, really.
[laughs nervously]

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:10.919
That was weird.

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:12.988
-No.
-No, in...

01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:15.124
-No.
-In a good way.

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:19.395
Yeah, that was... Wow.

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:21.564
I can't believe
we just had sex.

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:23.132

[siren blaring]

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:54.497
-Are you sure you don't
want us to go in with you?
-[Erica] No, I'm okay.

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:57.333
I love you.

01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:01.237
-Thanks, Sherm.
-Bye.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.092
[door buzzes]

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:25.594
-Hi!
-Hi!

01:24:25.628 --> 01:24:27.130
Hey!

01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:29.865
-How are you? [laughs nervously]
-I'm fine.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.667
-It's not that bad.
-No?

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.702
-No. Yeah.
-You're okay?

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:36.705
To tell you the truth,
I just play video games
and watch TV all day.

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.942
Sounds good to me.

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:42.778
And it's all from
like, ten years ago,
so it kinda sucks, but...

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:43.979
Mario Kart, though, right?

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.515
-Nope.
-No? Smash Bros?

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.984
-Mm-mm.
-Damn.

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.519
So, how's the Sherm?

01:24:50.553 --> 01:24:54.457
The Sherm?
He's still-- pretty pissed,
I'm not gonna lie.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:57.460
He's also a little
weirded out by the whole
"Us having sex" thing,

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:59.928
but you know,
he'll get over it.

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:01.497
-I think.
-[chuckles]

01:25:02.565 --> 01:25:04.433
[laughs]

01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:08.437
You know,
my lawyer says that
I have a really good case.

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:10.573
After all those girls
came forward about Will.

01:25:11.574 --> 01:25:13.309
-Crazy.
-Yeah.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:15.711
You're a hero.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:17.613
Now you're my hero.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.784
I never got to say thank you.

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:23.719
Thank you. [laughs nervously]

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:25.221
For saving my ass.

01:25:26.655 --> 01:25:28.791
I basically owe
my whole life to you.

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:32.027
I'm serious.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.362
Don't mention it.

01:25:34.197 --> 01:25:35.864
[door buzzes]

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:37.333
How are you?
What's going on?

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:40.936
I'm good. I'm so--
I'm glad to see you...

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.538
and I...

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:45.741
Cut a deal with the DA
in exchange for my
home movie collection.

01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.510
So...

01:25:47.543 --> 01:25:49.512
I'm about to start
my nine months house arrest.

01:25:49.545 --> 01:25:51.747
I have a few years' probation.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.917
And they're still, like,
figuring out logistics,

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.652
but, um...

01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.788
I got this
sick new ankle bracelet.

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:00.823
[chuckles]

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.825
I'm gonna bedazzle
the fuck out of that shit!

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.862
-Can I tell you something?
-Mm-hm.

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.264
You look really hot.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.499
I lost ten pounds.

01:26:10.533 --> 01:26:13.101
Fucking shit!
Ten pounds in a month?

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:14.803
Food here isn't terrific.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.171
[warden] Two minutes.

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:21.944
Oh, my God, okay.

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:24.480
I have a surprise.
You ready yet?

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.682
-All right.
-Wait, let me find it.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.688
It's you!

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.759
-[blankly] Wow.
-You don't like it?

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.094
Are you sure it's mine?

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.264
Of course, it's yours.

01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:43.499
I'm a one-dick gal these days.

01:27:00.015 --> 01:27:05.220
* This is the sound
Of your heart
The sound of your heart *

01:27:05.254 --> 01:27:07.790
* It sounds lonely

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:14.797
* I think we're drifting apart
We're drifting apart *

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.832
* Ever so slowly

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:22.571
* Fade away

01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:25.774
* Fade away, my love

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:32.214
* Fade away

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:37.252
* Till you're out of sight

01:27:37.286 --> 01:27:39.422
* Out of sight

01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:43.526
* The sound of my heart
The sound of my heart *

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:45.994
* The sounds of me

01:27:48.397 --> 01:27:50.666
* It feels like
I'm falling apart *

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:55.838
* I'm falling apart
Ever so slowly *

01:27:55.871 --> 01:28:00.609
* I've got to
Fade away *

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:05.614
* Fade away, my love

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:10.653
* I've got to
Fade away *

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:16.091
* Till I'm out of sight

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.993
* Out of sight

01:28:24.099 --> 01:28:28.537
* This is the kind of love
That never goes out of style *

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:35.578
* 'Cause baby I know
That you'll always
Be waiting *

01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:39.648
* And I'll always
Want to come back *

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:31.033
* This is the kind of love
That never goes out of style *

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:35.571
* 'Cause baby I know
That I'll always
Be waiting *

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:41.109
* And you'll always
Want to come back *

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:46.048
* Oh, let us fade away

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:50.619
* Fade away, my love

01:29:50.653 --> 01:29:56.459
* We've got to
Fade away *

01:29:56.492 --> 01:30:01.597
* Till we're out of sight

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:03.866
* Out of sight

01:30:04.305 --> 01:30:10.448
