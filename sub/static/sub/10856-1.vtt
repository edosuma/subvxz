I miscalculated.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.191
You didn't miscalculate.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.027
You're gonna pull through.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.663
Just keep counting.

Carlos is still busy.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.041

banging the first lady, okay?

I didn't realize
you had a secretary.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.058
Uh, about that.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.060
We ran into
some complications.

What complications?

26:37.930 --> 26:40.230
Well, first, the good news.
We have the bonds.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.900
It just seems unlikely
we're going to be able
to get them to you.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.336
Now, you said if run
into any trouble to
give you a call.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.171
Well, we got some.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.340
So, I was thinking
maybe you could send
somebody to pick 'em up.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.275
Maybe pick us up, too.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.277
We got half the

It's getting hot.
Real hot.

Would you like me to
call you a cab?
No, carlos.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.618
I was thinking more like
a private plane

27:00.620 --> 27:02.252
Or a chopper, something.

Your outfit
can pull that off, right?

All I know is we're
out here in the middle

27:23.242 --> 27:25.376
There's plenty of runway
right in front of me.

all our flights are booked.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.848
Okay, fine.
I'll, um...

27:30.850 --> 27:32.383
I'll up your take.
All right?

27:32.385 --> 27:34.885
Say, uh, 40% of the $30 million.
Now, that's --

27:34.887 --> 27:37.388
Jesus christ,
that's $13 million, carlos.

Richie's the reason
we're trapped in here
in the first place.

Trust him...Because

35:09.541 --> 35:10.874
Okay, where?

35:10.876 --> 35:13.577
Mcgraw: Frederico...

35:13.579 --> 35:15.712
You got this, old man.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.180
Hold on.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.183
Tell ramona I said goodbye,
all right?

35:21.752 --> 35:24.855
Ramona's been dead
two years, earl.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.891
[ breathing heavily ]

35:27.893 --> 35:29.893
$46.02?

35:33.197 --> 35:35.532
That's a hell of
a high price to pay

35:35.534 --> 35:37.367
For a bottle of hooch,
isn't it?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.636
It'll be worth it.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.873
Frederico, I may never
get up off this floor.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.775
You're gonna get off
this floor if I have to
carry you out myself.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.612
That's a real nice thing

35:48.614 --> 35:51.748
That you'll never get to do.

35:51.750 --> 35:56.353
Just like
me baptizing your little girl.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.256
If I could...

35:59.258 --> 36:01.525
The answer would be yes.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.828
You don't have to say that,
earl.

36:04.830 --> 36:10.267
I'm all out of days,
frederico,

36:10.269 --> 36:12.602
But you still got yours.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.405
Make 'em good ones.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.642
[ door opens ]
I will.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.843
[ door slams ]

36:19.845 --> 36:21.645
You know what you're
asking us to do?

36:21.647 --> 36:23.647
We have to
cross the border, carlos.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.515
We're never gonna make it.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.784
Carlos: Oh, come on.
We mexicans do it all the time.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.655
All you got to do is find
the, uh, in-between spaces.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.191
I'll see you
on the other side, <i>cabrón.</i>

36:35.660 --> 36:37.427
We got to get moving.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.596
Carlos ain't I comin'.
Richie: I knew it.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.799
He's your guy.
This is on you.

36:42.801 --> 36:46.269
Guess we do it
the hard way.
No, hey. Look at me.

36:46.271 --> 36:48.205
We are not
killing any more people today.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.574
You got that?

36:50.576 --> 36:52.943
Mcgraw: Frederico...

36:52.945 --> 36:54.878
You promise me somethin'.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.416
You kill these bastards,

36:59.418 --> 37:02.385
No matter what it takes.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.223
Even if you have to follow them
to the gates of hell,

37:06.225 --> 37:08.625
You kill them for me.

37:08.627 --> 37:12.896
I swear on my daughter,
I will.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.743
Seth: Well, now.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.414
Looks like
it's just you, hero.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.321
We finish
what we started.
Shut up, richard.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.923
Freddie:
Listen. Listen to me.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.591
I just want to get
these girls out of here

37:41.593 --> 37:42.993
And pete some help --
that's all I want.

37:42.995 --> 37:45.028
You guys can get in your car
and you can go.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.631
Hell, you can take
my car. Ain't no one
gonna stop you in that.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.266
This is where
I draw the line.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.735
We leave this place,
we're asking to get caught.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.670
These people need to die.
Listen to me.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.839
I am not going to waste
my bullets, time, or energy

37:55.841 --> 37:57.507
Arguing with you
about this anymore.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.975
Shut up.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.477
$46.02.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.649
What?
They were
talkin' about it earlier.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.751
It's the price of
a really nice bottle of hooch.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.654
Actually, it refers to
section 46.02 of the
texas state penal code

38:10.656 --> 38:12.355
In regards to
concealed weapons.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.890
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.659
A person commits an offense
if that person

38:15.661 --> 38:18.762
Intentionally, knowingly,
or recklessly

38:18.764 --> 38:20.630
Carries on or about
him or herself

38:20.632 --> 38:22.432
A handgun or illegal knife,

38:22.434 --> 38:25.502
Especially if said handgun
is not registered,

38:25.504 --> 38:27.704
And that handgun is used
for protection on the premises

38:27.706 --> 38:31.908
Of a fine establishment
such as this one right here.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.910
Can I please
just shoot him now?

Low profile.

We were supposed to be
low profile.

42:04.989 --> 42:08.124
I know
you know the meaning of that.
