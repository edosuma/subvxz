00:04.920 --> 00:09.040
Hey, guys. It is literally
a million degrees out.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.200
I'm wearing shorts in January!

00:12.280 --> 00:14.520
Have you ever seen
prettier legs on a fella?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.280
Michael, we'll admire
your legs later.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.960
Snow Prom is tomorrow. We need to keep up
our campaign for Snow Queen and Snow King.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.200
Jackie, I did campaign.
I wrote our names all over the place.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.440
Kelso, you peed in the snow.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.920
In cursive!

00:31.960 --> 00:34.280
It was awesome.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.680
Okay, look, you may not
take this seriously, but I do.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.120
I used to be a rich,
popular girl.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.160
But now that my dad
has cut me off, I'm not rich...

00:43.240 --> 00:45.440
so I have to be
twice as popular.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.280
Okay, maybe you should spend less time
worrying about being popular...

00:48.360 --> 00:51.400
and more time being thoughtful,
friendly, considerate.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.360
Okay, can I get a translation
because that was gibberish.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.400
Come on, Michael.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.400
Hey, you know what? We should all go
to Snow Prom together, in one car...

01:01.480 --> 01:04.080
all of us hanging out,
laughing, driving.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.040
Whoo-hoo!
Good times.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.360
You need a ride, don't you?

01:08.440 --> 01:12.280
I so do. Pick me up
at the radio station.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.760
All right.
We'll all go together.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.600
Whoa. Whoa. Hyde, you're
going to a school dance?

01:18.680 --> 01:21.520
You're going to stink bomb
the teachers' lounge, aren't you? I want in!

01:21.600 --> 01:23.560
No, man, kid stuff.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.360
See, during the dance, I'm going to throw
a party in Coach Ferguson's office.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.360
I'm bringing my best stuff.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.360
A party with your best stuff?

01:33.240 --> 01:35.760
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

01:35.800 --> 01:39.560
- You know it.
- Oh, boy, you have a piÃ±ata?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.640
It's weird. I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.080
I've got my watch, my wallet,
my who-am-I-kidding condom.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.920
Yeah, sounds like you got everything,
except for a tall redhead.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.640
Yeah. What man
doesn't love a tall red...

02:01.720 --> 02:05.400
Oh, my God, Donna!
I forgot Donna.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074

02:44.320 --> 02:48.160
Mr. Hyde?
In school after hours?

02:48.240 --> 02:50.680
What, are you trying to
establish an alibi?

02:55.560 --> 03:00.760
Coach Ferguson, shouldn't you be on the
football field teaching boys to play with balls?

03:02.040 --> 03:04.760
Don't push my buttons, wiseacre.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.920
And there he goes.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.720
I think now is a good time
to go fumigate his office.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.760
Oh. I have exciting news
for you two.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.560
Michael, you have been
elected Snow King.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.640
Yeah!

03:22.720 --> 03:26.680
And, Jackie, you are
the new Snow Queen runner-up!

03:26.760 --> 03:30.360
Oh, my God!
This is the happiest day of my life!

03:30.440 --> 03:33.400
Wait, runner-up?

03:33.480 --> 03:38.640
How could that be?
There's been a mistake! It was fixed!

03:38.720 --> 03:41.880
You poke me one more time,
I'm gonna paddle you.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.720
That'd be hot.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.360
I-I have a serious announcement.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.200
A tornado warning has been issued.
I'm told it's code red.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.320
I don't know the codes,
but red sounds serious.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.240
Michael, this is
my worst nightmare.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.720
A tornado is your worst nightmare?

04:06.800 --> 04:09.440
Mine's monsters.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.720
How could I be runner-up?

04:11.800 --> 04:14.800
If I'm not a rich, popular girl,
I'm nothing.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.360
I'm like Donna.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.000
No, Jackie, you are the girlfriend
to the Snow King.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.280
Now, as Snow King,
I must lead my people to safety.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.920
All right, everyone!
Everyone, follow me!

04:36.880 --> 04:40.320
Remain calm, people!
These are just sports balls!

04:41.880 --> 04:44.240
Everyone grab a ball!

04:55.920 --> 04:57.840
All right.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.680
Now, I'm just so
worried about Eric.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.520
A tornado in January?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.800
Yeah, life's full of surprises.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.080
Like these two showing up
'cause they don't have a basement.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.920
Surprise!

05:40.120 --> 05:42.720
Gee, Red, you seem grouchy.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.240
Surprise!

05:48.800 --> 05:52.680
Red, if Eric gets caught in a tornado,
he'll get blown to Canada.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.880
He's very light.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.160
Kitty, the gym is the town's
bomb shelter.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.040
He'll be fine.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.400
I just hope he's not crying.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.960
Everybody knows he's my kid.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.560
Okay, you're right.
Eric's fine.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.600
Let's just talk about something else.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.880
Ooh! You know, Joanne taught me a lot
about lady orgasms.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.720
They've been around
longer than I thought.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.720
Okay, so talking's bad.
I know, charades!

06:41.400 --> 06:43.680
- No, thanks.
- What are you, chicken?

06:47.880 --> 06:51.760
Did you just call me chicken?

06:51.840 --> 06:55.040
That's it. Move the couch, Kitty.
She's going down.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.720
Oh, yeah.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.480
Busted, hophead.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.960
People of the make-out stairwell...

07:24.040 --> 07:26.400
this is your Snow King speaking.

07:26.440 --> 07:30.960
Boo! Hit the lights, fool!

07:31.040 --> 07:34.200
No, th-there's a tornado.
Everyone go to the gym.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.560
The Snow King has spoken!

07:37.760 --> 07:40.960
All right. That's gross.
Who threw the retainer?

07:42.800 --> 07:46.120
Oh, my God, Fez!
A tornado?

07:46.160 --> 07:49.640
This changes everything.
This could be our last night here on earth.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.600
Oh, no. I'm going to die a virgin.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.040
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.080
You can talk all you want,
but there's a tornado coming.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.640
Fez, I mean, let's do it.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.640
It?

08:09.720 --> 08:12.600
"It" it?
All right.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.560
I'm going to need you.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.880
- Eric, you're here!
- Donna, look, I'm sorry I'm late.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.840
I really did want to pick you up before
the dance. So it's no big deal, really.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.960
No big deal?
It's a huge deal.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.640
I was in back filing records, and suddenly
everyone was gone, and I was stuck here alone.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.600
And you risked the tornado for me.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.400
Tornado?

08:43.559 --> 08:46.840
What tornado...

08:46.920 --> 08:49.440
could stop me from helping you?

08:51.480 --> 08:56.680
So, uh, tell me, um, is the tornado,
like, um... like, out there?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.400
Yeah. They say it's a biggie.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.560
- Oh.
- Eric, are you okay?

09:04.640 --> 09:06.640
Sure.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.280
Uh, it's just that now
that I know you're okay...

09:09.320 --> 09:11.840
I can finally start
worrying about me.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.440
And, see, the thing
about me is...

09:17.480 --> 09:19.480
I don't want to die.

09:25.540 --> 09:28.900
So, what to do?

09:31.300 --> 09:36.740
Let's see, there's you,
there's me, candlelight.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.740
You know, back in
the old days we would have...

09:38.820 --> 09:41.980
- We're not doing that.
- Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

09:44.100 --> 09:48.220
So quick to dismiss the thing
you once ached for.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.180
You mean, cheese sticks?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.100
If you want to call it that, sure.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.220
Gyrating.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.620
Ehh, twisting. Uh...

10:13.700 --> 10:16.620
Hips! You make me
feel like hips!

10:18.140 --> 10:21.180
Uh, time!
We win.

10:21.260 --> 10:25.180
I was dancing!

10:25.260 --> 10:28.820
"You make me feel like hips"?

10:31.260 --> 10:33.780
It could have been a song.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.940
Is it hard to lose, Red?
'Cause you make it look so easy.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.660
You're in big trouble, bud.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.300
You should suspend me.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.460
I need a vacation.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.820
A tornado's coming.
It's code red.

10:54.900 --> 10:58.540
You know what that means.
I think it's serious.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.420
A tornado?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.660
Deadly spirals of wind
really freak me out.

11:05.700 --> 11:09.020
- All right, Coach Girlie. Calm down.
- I can't die yet!

11:09.100 --> 11:12.420
There's so much
I haven't experienced.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.100
I bet I know one thing
you haven't experienced.

11:22.220 --> 11:25.260
Tornadoes get a bad rap, man.

11:25.340 --> 11:27.700
It's not like the <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>

11:27.780 --> 11:30.140
I mean, where are the midgets?

11:30.220 --> 11:33.340
I bet I could bench,
like, 10 midgets.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.940
Hey, look at all the stuff
you confiscated.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.860
Mine. Mine.

11:41.380 --> 11:44.060
Ooh, la, la.
Mine now.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.260
Why am I not Snow Queen?

11:48.340 --> 11:51.940
For the last two weeks,
I was nice to everybody.

11:52.020 --> 11:56.580
Well, maybe not the A.V. Club,
but I mean, come on.

11:56.660 --> 11:59.100
Jackie, you can't just
be nice for two weeks.

11:59.180 --> 12:03.940
You have to be nice all the time.
Or very handsome.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.900
Oh, my banana nose!

12:06.980 --> 12:10.380
Oh. I thought this
was gone forever.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.420
Ha. It's still funny!

12:14.260 --> 12:16.380
Maybe Donna was right.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.580
Maybe being popular isn't as important
as being nice to people.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.660
I mean, I know that sounds wrong,
but anything's possible.

12:24.740 --> 12:28.620
Hey, Jackie, whatever makes
you feel better about being a loser.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.820
Hey, watch the banana nose!

12:37.700 --> 12:41.380
Hey, Hyde, when this is all over,
you think we'll still be friends?

12:42.620 --> 12:47.500
Well, my head says no,
but my heart says no.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.860
So, no.

12:51.940 --> 12:54.540
I wonder what Donna and Forman
are doing right now.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.260
This is the best tornado ever!

12:59.300 --> 13:03.980
I know! And who better to be stuck here with
than America's most beloved rock band...

13:04.060 --> 13:06.700
ladies and gentlemen, Aerosmith!

13:09.620 --> 13:13.020
Hey, as rock legends,
we've had some pretty good times.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.340
But it doesn't get any better than this.
Hello, Wisconsin!

13:17.940 --> 13:21.460
<i>Yeah, I dig this joint too.</i>
<i>Hello, Wisconsin.</i>

13:22.420 --> 13:24.420
That was your Aerosmith?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.380
You're bad at that.

13:26.460 --> 13:30.700
Steven Tyler is way cooler,
and Joe Perry is so dreamy.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.140
God, you're bad at that!

13:33.220 --> 13:35.900
What? That was dead-on!
Right, guys?

13:38.220 --> 13:40.900
I bought it.

13:43.940 --> 13:46.060
You, uh, really think
I'm dreamy?

13:50.820 --> 13:53.340
Whoa.

13:53.420 --> 13:56.940
The station manager's stuff
is way better than ours.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.860
Well, I lived my dream.
Let's go.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.060
Oh, wait. We can't just
leave Jackie here like that.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.100
You're right.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.900
Okay, we're good.

14:20.340 --> 14:24.860
Oh, Toto. Losing Snow Queen
has left me searching for guidance.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.180
Surely, the Wizard of Oz can help.

14:29.540 --> 14:34.060
Oh, well, Jackie, why'd you make me
the Scarecrow? He needs a brain.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.460
No. No, I made you
the Scarecrow...

14:37.540 --> 14:40.460
because you love chasing birds.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.660
- I do love chasing birds.
- <i>Okay.</i>

14:48.260 --> 14:51.780
Is this some kind of joke,
'cause I'm not laughing.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.900
Kelso's the Scarecrow?
Yeah.

15:03.020 --> 15:06.220
Look, guys! I'm a bear.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.540
Fez, you're the Cowardly Lion.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.500
But I want to be a bear.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.140
- At least you got a brain.
- This sucks.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.300
Oh, will everyone just shut up?

15:20.380 --> 15:24.100
When it's your dream,
you can be whatever you want.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.740
I want to be a bear.

15:30.140 --> 15:32.340
Jackie, what the hell?

15:39.140 --> 15:42.460
She totally made you a witch.
That's so awesome!

15:42.500 --> 15:44.700
She made you a flying monkey.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.660
What?

15:48.260 --> 15:50.260
Oh, crap!

15:50.340 --> 15:52.180
- Let's kick her ass!
- Yeah.

15:56.620 --> 16:00.140
Miss Wizard, I'm confused.
I lost Snow Queen.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.940
And now I'm wondering
if titles and popularity...

16:03.020 --> 16:05.780
aren't as important
as being a good person.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.300
Well, how do you know
when you're a good person?

16:08.380 --> 16:12.860
When everyone likes you, right?
When you're popular.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.900
- And how do you know when you're popular?
- Oh, my God!

16:15.940 --> 16:19.420
When you win titles like Snow Queen!

16:19.460 --> 16:23.300
Winning titles and being a good person
are the same thing.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.100
So you go after that title, child.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.260
Oh, I will, Miss Wizard.
I will.

16:29.340 --> 16:33.540
And remember, if someone calls
you shallow, they're just jealous.

16:33.580 --> 16:37.380
<i>Just jealous. Jealous. Jealous.</i>

16:44.180 --> 16:48.060
Ah, our own private stairwell.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.980
This is exactly how I pictured
losing my virginity...

16:52.260 --> 16:55.620
except it was
on a bed of flowers...

16:55.700 --> 16:58.100
and there were two of you.

17:00.180 --> 17:05.020
Tornado passed through,
is heading to Illinois.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.740
Kiss my ass, Chicago!

17:09.940 --> 17:13.660
Oh, my God!
We're-We're safe.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.819
Sex just doesn't seem
important anymore.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.740
I... I disagree.

17:22.460 --> 17:25.020
And... And here's why.

17:25.060 --> 17:28.300
Let's go celebrate with everyone.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.980
Oh, you can make a tornado,
but you can't let me do it?

17:36.580 --> 17:39.420
No, you are not a just God!

17:41.060 --> 17:42.980
Okay.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.460
No six.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.820
No six. And...

17:48.900 --> 17:51.460
six!

17:53.060 --> 17:56.100
- Look, Park Place.
- Ah, Park Place.

17:56.180 --> 18:00.100
- Pay up.
- I told you we shouldn't spend all our money on Marvin Gardens.

18:02.500 --> 18:07.180
Oh, and Baltic Avenue
was such a help.

18:08.340 --> 18:11.580
I bought that with my
beauty-contest winnings.

18:13.980 --> 18:17.020
Mmm. Poor Red, losing again.

18:17.060 --> 18:21.140
While we have this
large housing development...

18:21.220 --> 18:24.500
that I like to call Joanne Land.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.500
Where's Red Land?

18:28.740 --> 18:32.020
I'll tell you where it is.
It's right up your...

18:32.100 --> 18:34.740
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Shh.

18:34.820 --> 18:38.860
<i>This just in. The National Weather</i>
<i>Service has canceled the tornado warning.</i>

18:38.940 --> 18:42.660
<i>And updating our top story,</i>
<i>a local teen is in critical condition...</i>

18:42.740 --> 18:44.660
Oh, game over.
Call it a tie.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.740
A tie?
We had all the money.

18:47.820 --> 18:51.820
So? We had
the get-out-of-jail-free card.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.300
And you can't put
a price on freedom.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.500
Night, night.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.700
Look, Jackie,
I know you're upset...

19:03.780 --> 19:06.620
and I don't know why
you're not Snow Queen.

19:06.700 --> 19:10.180
But I do know this:
I am Snow King.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.100
So that's pretty cool.

19:17.060 --> 19:20.420
Michael, I'm not upset.
I just had the best dream.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.300
And now I've got to
campaign for next year.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.340
Guys, how's my hair?

19:27.420 --> 19:29.740
- Yeah, it's fantastic.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

19:31.140 --> 19:35.260
This was fun.
We haven't just hung out in, like, forever.

19:35.300 --> 19:39.340
Plus, you're, like, my hero. Most guys would
not risk a tornado for an ex-girlfriend.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.300
Yeah.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.100
Wow.

19:55.140 --> 19:59.580
Yeah, well, I just wanted to kiss you...

19:59.660 --> 20:03.420
before you found out that I went to the dance,
forgot you and I didn't know about the tornado.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.380
Okay, this was swell.

20:07.020 --> 20:09.180
Wait, wait, wait.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.260
So, you forgot me?

20:15.140 --> 20:17.940
Okay, you're mad.

20:18.020 --> 20:20.340
Actually, no.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.460
I mean, if we were still dating,
I'd be super pissed.

20:22.540 --> 20:25.780
But we're not, so it's kind of funny.

20:26.980 --> 20:29.460
You know what?
Let me buy you a burger.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.300
I can't believe you totally
snaked a kiss under false pretenses.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.020
Yeah, I'm a little proud of that, yeah.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.220
Well, I'm a lock for next year.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.540
I introduced myself to everyone.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.860
And I know they liked me, 'cause
they laughed at everything I said.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.260
I mean, I even shook hands with that
nose-picking, chess-club guy.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.660
Ooh, I'd better wash up.

21:03.820 --> 21:06.300
- You ready?
- Yeah.
