01:20.279 --> 01:21.546
                  Hello, Archie.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.448
Hold it. Don't make me          
spill nothing now.              

01:24.450 --> 01:26.484
Where were you?                 
                     Upstairs.  

01:26.486 --> 01:27.886
What was you doing              
up there?                       

01:27.888 --> 01:33.792
          Oh, well, we ain't got
          no bathroom down here.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.428
      That ain't                
      no excuse.                

01:37.430 --> 01:39.698
You know we're having           
special company tonight.        

01:39.700 --> 01:44.302
Oh, I know. But you told me     
you invited Joe Tucker for 6:30.

01:44.304 --> 01:45.704
Yeah, but he's                  
one of them guys                

01:45.706 --> 01:47.205
that always comes               
half an hour early.             

01:47.207 --> 01:49.007
When he was working with us     
down the plant                  

01:49.009 --> 01:51.943
we used to call him             
an eager bleeder.               

01:51.945 --> 01:55.013
There we are.                   
Look at that there, Edith.      

01:55.015 --> 01:56.581
Not a drop spilt.               

01:56.583 --> 01:59.718
You could never                 
do that, huh?                   

01:59.720 --> 02:01.886
                Well, what      
                 are you doing? 

02:01.888 --> 02:05.123
I'm performing what you call    
a whiskey transplant.           

02:06.391 --> 02:08.827
I'm pouring this                
cheap Heathcliff Scotch         

02:08.829 --> 02:12.097
into a bottle of Haig Pinch     
pint of Scotch, see that?       

02:12.099 --> 02:14.099
Because that's Joe Tucker's     
favorite Scotch.                

02:14.101 --> 02:16.167
I always like to do right       
by my guests.                   

02:18.170 --> 02:21.206
              But won't he taste
                the difference? 

02:21.208 --> 02:23.074
Nah! All Scotch                 
tastes the same.                

02:23.076 --> 02:25.076
It all tastes                   
like iodine.                    

02:25.078 --> 02:27.545
Come on, come on, come on.      
Get something on the table, huh?

02:27.547 --> 02:29.013
Hurry up.                       
        Oh, yeah. Right away.   

02:29.015 --> 02:31.349
        Yeah. All right.        

02:42.494 --> 02:43.895
It's the first time             
in history                      

02:43.897 --> 02:47.632
a person ever got run down      
by a tapeworm.                  

02:49.802 --> 02:51.702
     Look at the way            
     you're dressed.            

02:51.704 --> 02:54.139
Can't you do something          
a little better than that       

02:54.141 --> 02:55.974
with Joe Tucker                 
coming to dinner?               

02:55.976 --> 02:58.409
            What's so special   
            about Joe Tucker?   

02:58.411 --> 03:00.544
I'll tell you what's special    
about Joe Tucker.               

03:00.546 --> 03:02.914
You're a slob.                  

03:04.016 --> 03:06.151
Joe Tucker happens to be        
my best friend                  

03:06.153 --> 03:08.253
that I ain't seen               
for 18 years.                   

03:08.255 --> 03:10.088
                  How can he be 
                your best friend

03:10.090 --> 03:11.689
         if you haven't seen him
              for 18 years?     

03:11.691 --> 03:13.892
     Aaah! Go away.             

03:13.894 --> 03:16.060
What the hell do you know       
about friendship?               

03:16.062 --> 03:18.963
Joe Tucker and me used to work  
together down at the plant      

03:18.965 --> 03:20.364
and we were                     
close, buddy.                   

03:20.366 --> 03:23.268
We were as close as, what do    
you call, Damon and Runyon.     

03:25.704 --> 03:28.472
Joe Tucker was the guy that     
taught me how to be foreman     

03:28.474 --> 03:30.275
so I could take over            
the job after him.              

03:30.277 --> 03:31.876
He learned me                   
all the fine points             

03:31.878 --> 03:32.877
about loading                   
and lifting.                    

03:32.879 --> 03:34.378
                  What's there  
                    to know?    

03:34.380 --> 03:37.448
Don't be a wise guy.            
There's a lot to know.          

03:37.450 --> 03:38.950
Wise guys like you              
that think                      

03:38.952 --> 03:40.584
there ain't much to know        
about lifting                   

03:40.586 --> 03:42.854
are walking around today        
wearing a dress.                

03:42.856 --> 03:44.655
Get away                        
from me, huh?                   

03:45.791 --> 03:48.426
             Just get away      
                from me.        

03:48.428 --> 03:49.828
                Come on, Edith. 
              Come on. Hurry up.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.430
      Get some snicks and snacks
        around the joint, huh?  

03:52.432 --> 03:53.865
I don't understand,             
Archie.                         

03:53.867 --> 03:55.666
If Joe was so good              
down at the job,                

03:55.668 --> 03:57.068
how come he's not               
working there anymore?          

03:57.070 --> 03:59.170
        Because Joe Tucker      
  was cut out for better things.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.005
            He got himself      
                 a big job      

04:01.007 --> 04:02.841
     in a plant up in Rochester,
              New York.         

04:02.843 --> 04:04.242
                 He's a big shot
                    up there.   

04:04.244 --> 04:06.244
        But he ain't too big    
         to come and have dinner

04:06.246 --> 04:07.645
                    with one of 
                his old pals.   

04:07.647 --> 04:10.481
What is that,                   
the latest in dinner wear?      

04:10.483 --> 04:13.051
          It's a little accident
            I had down at work, 

04:13.053 --> 04:15.253
        a word that's foreign   
                  to you.       

04:15.255 --> 04:17.856
 Here you are. Here's some dip. 
                      All right.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.391
Archie, look at                 
your sleeve!                    

04:20.392 --> 04:21.959
It's all ripped.                
            I know that.        

04:21.962 --> 04:24.863
        I had a little accident 
    down at work. That's all.   

04:24.865 --> 04:26.297
            I'm carrying a crate
              of machine parts  

04:26.299 --> 04:27.698
        and I drop them down.   

04:27.700 --> 04:30.501
    When I went to pick them up,
    I caught my shirt on a nail.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.103
          The worst part was    
      Prendergast, the big boss,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.204
            come by and seen me.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.805
    You should have heard him   
            laying into me.     

04:34.807 --> 04:35.907
                  I gotta change
                     my shirt.  

04:35.909 --> 04:39.043
         Get away from          
      them snick-snacks.        

04:40.913 --> 04:42.213
                        Hi!     

04:42.215 --> 04:43.214
EDITH:                          
Hello, Gloria.                  

04:43.216 --> 04:45.350
Hurry up.                       
Take your coat off.             

04:45.352 --> 04:47.685
Joe Tucker will                 
be here any minute              

04:47.687 --> 04:51.455
and Archie always says that     
he gets here half an hour early.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.857
             What time's        
    he supposed to be here?     

04:52.859 --> 04:53.858
6:30.                           

04:53.860 --> 04:56.727
     Oh! It's five after 6.     

04:56.729 --> 04:58.763
        He's late.              

04:58.765 --> 05:00.731
                [DOORBELL RINGS]
No, he's here!                  

05:03.468 --> 05:04.468
                          Edith!

05:04.470 --> 05:05.870
    Joe!                        
                    How are you?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.139
  It's so good to see you again.
Oh, you too, Joe.               

05:08.141 --> 05:09.473
Come on in.                     

05:09.475 --> 05:11.209
              You remember      
                Gloria?         

05:11.211 --> 05:13.378
  Well, sure, I remember Gloria.
        Where is she?           

05:14.914 --> 05:17.882
         That one is Gloria,    
            right there.        

05:20.386 --> 05:22.287
                  No, that ain't
                      Gloria.   

05:22.289 --> 05:26.124
         Gloria's a cute, little
          fat kid about so high.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.027
  That's Gloria,                
    grown up.                   

05:29.029 --> 05:31.029
                     JOE:       
             I don't believe it.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.764
      Well, there's only one way
             to prove it.       

05:33.766 --> 05:35.800
            The Gloria I knew   

05:35.802 --> 05:37.969
                  always used to
                    like these. 

05:37.971 --> 05:39.770
Chocolate licorice!             

05:39.772 --> 05:40.939
             Oh!                

05:40.941 --> 05:43.007
                      Oh, that's
                      my Gloria.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.209
             Come on. Give your 
        Uncle Tuck a big hug!   

05:45.211 --> 05:46.811
    Uncle Tuck,                 
it's so good to see you.        

05:46.813 --> 05:48.012
    You don't know              
 my husband, Michael.           

05:48.014 --> 05:50.982
            Oh, hello, Michael. 
          It's a great pleasure.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.650
  Come on, Joe.                 
    Sit down.                   

05:52.652 --> 05:54.485

10:43.576 --> 10:46.176
 He gave me the strength to come
back to my old stomping grounds,

10:46.178 --> 10:47.811
                     look up    
                 my old friends.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.980
Oh, you mean                    
like me, huh?                   

10:49.982 --> 10:51.582
                Yeah, yeah,     
                    like you,   

10:51.584 --> 10:53.117
         like Steve Prendergast.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.086
Ste-- Steve Prendergast?        
You mean my boss down at work?  

10:56.088 --> 10:57.087
                        Yeah.   

10:57.089 --> 10:59.257
                I finally got   
            the guts to call him

10:59.259 --> 11:02.059
and find out whether maybe I can
get back in the old plant again.

11:02.061 --> 11:05.630
You know, Prendergast and me,   
    we were pretty good buddies.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.131
    Oh, yes.                    

11:07.133 --> 11:09.734
Jeez, he never says nothing to  
me, but he always talked to you.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.001
He used to like you.            
                        Yeah.   

11:11.003 --> 11:12.403
                Well, he told me
                to go down      

11:12.405 --> 11:13.904
                  and see       
          the personnel manager.

11:13.906 --> 11:16.240
                  There's a spot
                    opening up. 

11:19.478 --> 11:22.380
    Funny. I didn't hear of     
      no spot opening up.       

11:22.382 --> 11:24.848
             Oh, well, I'm sure 
            it's not much, Arch.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.752
         But whatever they give,
             I'm gonna take.    

11:27.754 --> 11:28.753
    Yeah, yeah, sure.           

11:28.755 --> 11:30.688
      But, well, you would      
          never wanna           

11:30.690 --> 11:32.556
    go back to the old          
     loading dock no more.      

11:32.558 --> 11:33.791
         Who wouldn't?          

11:33.793 --> 11:35.660
      Anything they offer,      
        I'll grab.              

11:35.662 --> 11:38.095
     I've been out of work      
     too long to be proud.      

11:38.097 --> 11:39.096
                 Dinner!        

11:39.098 --> 11:40.097
Michael, dinner!                

11:40.099 --> 11:42.366
    Come on, Arch. I'm starving.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.604
Joe, you're gonna sit right     
here. You're the guest of honor.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.372
Archie's chair.                 

11:48.374 --> 11:50.441
That's at the head              
  of the table.                 

11:50.443 --> 11:54.412
 Archie, you don't mind         
if Joe takes your place,        

11:54.414 --> 11:56.547
        do you?                 

11:59.918 --> 12:04.322
      Jeez, it looks like       
I ain't gonna have much choice. 

12:12.497 --> 12:13.798
Joe.                            

12:13.800 --> 12:14.965
                And you think   
                that's funny.   

12:14.967 --> 12:16.367
      You should have seen      
            the gag             

12:16.369 --> 12:18.536
    that Archie pulled          
on old Fatso Miller.            

12:18.538 --> 12:19.903
  Remember that,                
      Arch?                     

12:19.905 --> 12:22.239
      Yeah, no, I don't remember
    none of them things now.    

12:22.241 --> 12:24.107
  You ought to.                 
It was your idea.               

12:24.109 --> 12:27.511
Oh, yeah. But people don't wanna
     hear them stories, Joe.    

12:27.513 --> 12:28.846
     I do, Arch.                

12:28.848 --> 12:31.915
I'd like to hear about          
 the time you had an idea.      

12:36.588 --> 12:39.957
Why don't you go and make       
a long-distance phone call      

12:39.959 --> 12:42.860
      from the other end.       

12:44.730 --> 12:46.296
Oh, Archie,                     
that reminds me.                

12:46.298 --> 12:49.667
      Before you got home,      
     you got a phone call.      

12:49.669 --> 12:50.934
                    I got       
                a phone call?   

12:50.936 --> 12:52.870
        Edith, why don't you    
          write them things down

12:52.872 --> 12:54.271
                    so you      
             remember them, huh?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.340
Oh, I remembered                
to write it down.               

12:56.342 --> 12:59.443
  Oh, I just forgot.            
I put it in my pocket.          

12:59.445 --> 13:01.545
                    Ah. Hey.    

13:02.914 --> 13:04.782
                Uh, Edith, uh...

13:04.784 --> 13:06.350
                    I gotta talk
                     to you now.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.419
Well, go ahead.                 
         No. Out in the kitchen.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.054
    Oh. Excuse us,              
    please.                     

13:11.056 --> 13:12.523
     Yeah. Excuse us,           
    please, huh?                

13:12.525 --> 13:14.258
      We're just going          
  in the kitchen over here.     

13:14.260 --> 13:16.761
              Get in there!     

13:18.764 --> 13:20.130
     What is it?                

13:20.132 --> 13:22.833
 Look at this here. Jim Sanders.
      You know who that is?     

13:22.835 --> 13:26.136
Yeah. He's the personnel        
manager down at the plant.      

13:26.138 --> 13:29.172
    That's right. He's in charge
        of hiring and firing.   

13:29.174 --> 13:30.875
            And being as how    
              I'm already hired,

13:30.877 --> 13:32.209
        what does that leave?   

13:34.479 --> 13:35.946
    Firing.                     

13:39.183 --> 13:42.152
    Oh!                         
                    Oh.         

13:42.154 --> 13:45.556
Oh, Archie,                     
they wouldn't fire you,         

13:45.558 --> 13:47.691
not after                       
all these years.                

13:47.693 --> 13:49.593
             What do you know   
             about it, Edith?   

13:49.595 --> 13:50.961
             I'm down there     
            every day.          

13:50.963 --> 13:52.996
There's a lot of funny things   
          happened lately.      

13:52.998 --> 13:54.298
Like what?                      

13:54.300 --> 13:55.999
            Well, like,         
         for instance, yesterday

13:56.001 --> 13:57.468
      the big boss, Prendergast,
            come by there.      

13:57.470 --> 13:58.869
              He don't even     
             say hello to me.   

13:58.871 --> 14:01.472
But you said he never           
says hello to you.              

14:01.474 --> 14:04.141
            That's right,       
        and he done it again.   

14:05.243 --> 14:06.911
Oh, Archie,                     
I think you're getting          

14:06.913 --> 14:08.879
all worked up                   
over nothing.                   

14:08.881 --> 14:09.914
                Edith, Edith,   

14:09.916 --> 14:11.114
          this guy out here,    
             Joe Tucker,        

14:11.116 --> 14:13.818
        is the best loading dock
         foreman they ever had. 

14:13.820 --> 14:16.053
      Prendergast knows that.   
  Don't you see what I'm saying?

14:16.055 --> 14:18.221
             Tucker's after     
                my job.         

14:18.223 --> 14:21.258
Oh, Archie,                     
Joe wouldn't do that.           

14:21.260 --> 14:23.527
He's such                       
a nice man.                     

14:23.529 --> 14:24.528
                "A nice man."   

14:24.530 --> 14:26.063
     Edith, in an energy crisis,

14:26.065 --> 14:28.732
    there ain't no such thing   
             as a nice man.     

14:28.734 --> 14:31.569
Oh, Archie, Joe wouldn't        
do nothing bad to you.          

14:31.571 --> 14:33.236
He's your                       
best friend.                    

14:33.238 --> 14:36.273
                 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:36.275 --> 14:39.577
  And Benedict Arnold was George
     Washington's best friend.  

14:39.579 --> 14:41.378
                  You know      
            what happened there.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.646
What?                           

14:42.648 --> 14:45.048
        Oh, Edith, Benedict     
         was after George's job.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.817
             And George got wise
                to him.         

14:46.819 --> 14:48.819
I never heard that.             

14:48.821 --> 14:49.920
                 Why, certainly.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.355
        It's the truth.         

14:51.357 --> 14:52.756
      Otherwise, if it wasn't,  
     on Washington's birthday,  

14:52.758 --> 14:55.759
    we'd be eating eggs Benedict
    instead of cherry pie.      

15:01.500 --> 15:03.033
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]              

15:03.035 --> 15:04.502
            Come in.            

15:04.504 --> 15:06.971
        You wanted to see me,   
            Mr. Sanders.        

15:06.973 --> 15:08.572
         Yes. Come in, Bunker.  
Yeah.                           

15:08.574 --> 15:10.741
                 Close the door,
                     please.    

15:10.743 --> 15:13.343
Oh, yeah.                       
The door, yeah.                 

15:13.345 --> 15:15.145
There it is,                    
Mr. Sanders, closed,            

15:15.147 --> 15:17.915
just the way                    
you like it.                    

15:17.917 --> 15:19.383
                     All right. 
                    Have a seat.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.952
Uh, well, I don't wanna sit,    
Mr. Sanders, because, you know, 

15:21.954 --> 15:23.621
being a loading dock foreman,   
I never sit.                    

15:23.623 --> 15:25.022
Mine ain't a sitting job,       

15:25.024 --> 15:26.023
you know, like this.            

15:26.025 --> 15:27.057
Well, no, no.                   

15:27.059 --> 15:28.492
         Nothing wrong          
         with your job.         

15:28.494 --> 15:30.293
    It's a sitting job          
  because it's a thinking job.  

15:30.295 --> 15:32.095
        My job ain't got        
  nothing to do with thinking   

15:32.097 --> 15:35.065
    and I'm very good           
             at it.             

15:37.602 --> 15:39.703
     I'm, uh, sure you are.     
Yeah. Thank you.                

15:39.705 --> 15:41.238
         Now, Bunker--          

15:41.240 --> 15:42.640
 Hey, this isn't gonna keep me  

15:42.642 --> 15:44.708
  away too long from the men,   
      is it, Mr. Sanders?       

15:44.710 --> 15:46.143
         Because my men         
        don't like that.        

15:46.145 --> 15:47.978
        They fall apart         
      when I ain't there.       

15:47.980 --> 15:49.914
                  Just sit down,
                      Bunker.   

15:49.916 --> 15:51.381
             This will only take
                a few minutes.  

15:51.383 --> 15:53.784
Yeah. Like yesterday,           
I was away.                     

15:53.786 --> 15:55.986
You know, my one little         
two-minute break of the day.    

15:55.988 --> 15:58.355
I went to                       
the toilet.                     

15:58.357 --> 16:00.991
Then I come back and there's    
a crate of machine parts        

16:00.993 --> 16:02.960
there on the dock,              
fell down.                      

16:02.962 --> 16:04.962
Well, I had to take             
responsibility there, you know? 

16:04.964 --> 16:06.664
The top man                     
always has to do that.          

16:06.666 --> 16:08.131
Take, for instance,             
Richard E. Nixon.               

16:08.133 --> 16:10.267
Same thing with him.            

16:10.269 --> 16:12.469
He's got a bunch of jerks       
working under him,              

16:12.471 --> 16:14.038
screwing everything up.         

16:14.040 --> 16:18.108
But he's the top man. He's gotta
take responsibility, right?     

16:19.811 --> 16:23.213
Look, uh, Bunker, I wanted      
to talk to you about Joe Tucker.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.315
        You see, he's applied   
             for a job with us  

16:25.317 --> 16:27.751
         and Mr. Prendergast    
     is very fond of Joe Tucker.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.252
              He wanted me      
        to hire him immediately.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.889
        Oh, he did, huh?        

16:31.891 --> 16:33.991
But, uh, first I'd like to do   
         a little checking.     

16:33.993 --> 16:37.094
     So, uh, tell me now, what  
do you know about Joe Tucker?   

16:37.096 --> 16:38.629
Oh, well, uh...                 

16:38.631 --> 16:42.099
uh, well, he used to be         
a great worker years ago.       

16:42.101 --> 16:45.435
Of course, I ain't seen him     
lift nothing lately.            

16:45.437 --> 16:49.206
  Well, uh, how long has it been
    since you worked with him?  

16:49.208 --> 16:53.143
      Oh, gee, about, uh,       
     ooh, 18 years, maybe.      

16:53.145 --> 16:54.812
     I was only a kid then.     

16:54.814 --> 16:58.515
Uh, gee, that'd make Joe,       
      what, about 59, 60.       

16:58.517 --> 17:02.352
                51.             
             51?                

17:02.354 --> 17:05.222
Jeez, he looked a lot older than
that when I seen him last night.

17:05.223 --> 17:06.656
            He did?             

17:06.659 --> 17:07.925
Well, there's                   
nothing to that                 

17:07.926 --> 17:09.326
because he's                    
been worrying, see?             

17:09.328 --> 17:10.761
That's why                      
he looked that way.             

17:10.762 --> 17:13.163
Uh, he's been out of work       
for six months.                 

17:13.165 --> 17:14.564
But that ain't                  
his fault, neither.             

17:14.566 --> 17:16.465
It's just that nobody           
wanted to hire him.             

17:17.568 --> 17:19.169
          Well, when you saw him
                last night,     

17:19.171 --> 17:20.938
                did he, uh,     
                 seem depressed?

17:20.940 --> 17:22.772
No, no, no!                     
He was very happy.              

17:22.775 --> 17:25.175
He was happy to see me.         
He was so happy, he cried.      

17:25.176 --> 17:28.178
                    You mean    
                he really cried?

17:28.180 --> 17:31.448
Oh, yeah. The wet eyes, the     
handkerchief, the whole thing.  

17:31.450 --> 17:33.483
Just like he done               
the last time.                  

17:33.485 --> 17:35.819
            You mean you've     
            seen him cry before?

17:35.821 --> 17:38.956
Oh, yeah. The time he went up   
to take that job at Rochester.  

17:38.958 --> 17:40.323
                      Oh, I see.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.693
Well, then, actually you have   
      only seen him cry twice.  

17:42.695 --> 17:46.429
      Yeah, that's right.       
     Like going and coming.     

17:46.431 --> 17:49.700
     But I don't know what      
 he was doing in-between times. 

17:49.702 --> 17:52.703
Well, don't write that down,    
Mr. Sanders, see.               

17:52.705 --> 17:55.338
Just because a guy's crying,    
that don't mean he's a nut.     

17:55.340 --> 17:57.607
    Ask any                     
    psychiatrist.               

17:57.609 --> 18:00.811
Yeah, don't write that down     
because, uh, listen,            

18:00.813 --> 18:03.681
uh, sometimes,                  
I even cry myself.              

18:03.683 --> 18:06.249
                             Oh!
Don't write that down.          

18:08.987 --> 18:13.791
        Well, I mean,           
just when do you cry, Bunker?   

18:13.793 --> 18:16.827
Well, like, uh...uh,            
for instance, uh--              

18:16.829 --> 18:20.597
Well, like                      
on a religious occasion.        

18:20.599 --> 18:21.932
          Yeah. Yeah.           

18:21.934 --> 18:25.302
    Like when I was watching    
     <i>Tricia's Wedding</i> on TV.    

18:27.839 --> 18:31.474
            Mike, Gloria,       
         ain't it wonderful?    

18:31.476 --> 18:34.912
        It's 5:30               
and Archie ain't home yet.      

18:36.581 --> 18:38.982
What's wonderful                
about that?                     

18:38.984 --> 18:40.383
      Well, don't you see?      

18:40.385 --> 18:41.919
      The later Archie is,      

18:41.921 --> 18:44.487
     the less fired he is.      

18:46.024 --> 18:47.224

                 Edith.         

18:57.468 --> 18:59.636
Gee, Daddy, what happened       
with Mr. Sanders?               

18:59.638 --> 19:01.238
        All right, all right.   
     I'll tell youse everything.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.841
      Just let your mother go   
  and get me a can of beer, huh?

19:03.843 --> 19:06.610
  Oh, well, promise you won't   
start telling before I get back.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.279

      Get out of my chair. Yeah.
        Get out of the chair.   

19:14.353 --> 19:17.420
  Did you start                 
  telling yet?                  

19:25.396 --> 19:28.866
        Well, let me sit down.  
      I ain't even sat down yet.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.533
 Daddy, can't you see           
  how worried Ma is?            

19:30.535 --> 19:32.502
          Tell us.              
 What did Mr. Sanders want?     

19:32.504 --> 19:33.804
                Ah, nothing,    
                  nothing.      

19:33.806 --> 19:36.006
    He just wanted to ask me    
some questions about Joe Tucker.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.909
Oh, is that all?                

19:38.911 --> 19:41.645
                What do you mean
                 "Is that all?" 

19:41.647 --> 19:43.847
        I had to go in          
    and talk about Tucker there.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.817
            I had to give him   
        a character referential.

19:48.219 --> 19:50.353
      What did you              
  tell them about Joe?          

19:50.355 --> 19:53.223
    Oh, gave him                
      a big buildup.            

19:53.225 --> 19:54.825
    Said he was                 
     a great worker...          

19:54.827 --> 19:57.227
     18 years ago.              

19:57.229 --> 19:58.728
                18 years ago?

        with faint praise.

     cursed the man.

not a very good recommendation.

    Well, what would Michael    
     like me to tell them?      

20:10.409 --> 20:13.110
 Well, tell them what you always
 tell us. That he's a great guy.

      after my job.

    What I should have done     

20:19.484 --> 20:21.351
    was tell that personnel     
    manager the truth.          

20:21.353 --> 20:23.353
      I've got a good mind      
  to go back tomorrow morning   

20:23.355 --> 20:24.354

     the truth.                 

20:24.356 --> 20:26.223
              Oh, and what's    
                the truth?      

20:26.225 --> 20:27.624
The truth, little girl,         

20:27.626 --> 20:30.493
is that Joe Tucker's been       
going to see a psychiatrist.    

20:30.495 --> 20:31.829
So what?

         in this country,

they don't like head-shrinkers  
 or people who get shrinked.    

20:40.039 --> 20:41.705
                  MICHAEL: Yeah.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.941
And if you tell Sanders that,   
      they'll never hire Joe.
