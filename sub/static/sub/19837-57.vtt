00:07.970 --> 00:10.440
<b>We didn't learn what happened to Uvo,</b>

00:10.910 --> 00:13.820
<b>but we have the chain user's name and face.</b>

00:14.530 --> 00:16.130
<b>We still don't know his abilities.</b>

00:16.130 --> 00:17.700
<b>All right.</b>

00:17.700 --> 00:20.080
<b>We'll be waiting in the Hotel Beitacle lobby.</b>

00:21.350 --> 00:23.580
<b>It sounds like we got the 
chain user's identity.</b>

00:25.110 --> 00:26.690
<b>He has three remaining allies.</b>

00:28.030 --> 00:29.090
<b>Let's go.</b>

00:29.590 --> 00:30.600
<b>Let's go.</b>

00:34.740 --> 00:35.960
<b><i>What do we do?</i></b>

00:35.960 --> 00:38.540
<b><i>There isn't any point in 
capturing Pakunoda now.</i></b>

00:39.380 --> 00:42.060
<b><i>If I were Kurapika, I would switch targets.</i></b>

00:42.510 --> 00:44.820
<b><i>If I wanted to crush the Troupe,</i></b>

00:44.820 --> 00:46.600
<b><i>I would target the boss.</i></b>

00:47.090 --> 00:49.580
<b><i>Melody's listening in on the conversation,</i></b>

00:49.580 --> 00:51.770
<b><i>so they should know where we're going.</i></b>

00:55.770 --> 00:57.940
<b><i>It's a question of when he'll attack.</i></b>

00:57.940 --> 01:00.370
<b><i>We'll need to confer before we move.</i></b>

01:01.180 --> 01:02.370
<b><i>The first instant will decide it.</i></b>

01:03.190 --> 01:05.960
<b><i>Any slight delay could cost us our lives.</i></b>

02:26.000 --> 02:31.040
<b>Initiative x And x Law</b>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.510
<b>Wait here.</b>

02:47.090 --> 02:48.520
<b><i>They're too alert...</i></b>

02:49.210 --> 02:52.860
<b><i>They'll be watching anyone who walks in.</i></b>

02:53.430 --> 02:55.730
<b><i>I hope Kurapika and Melody 
arrived before us.</i></b>

02:55.730 --> 02:57.030
<b>Hey!</b>

02:57.340 --> 02:59.280
<b>Do you realize what time it is?!</b>

03:00.870 --> 03:03.970
<b>Idiot! It's Hotel Beitacle!</b>

03:03.970 --> 03:06.170
<b>How many times do I have to repeat myself?</b>

03:07.110 --> 03:08.290
<b><i>Leorio!</i></b>

03:09.730 --> 03:11.670
<b>What are you looking at, eh?</b>

03:12.060 --> 03:13.180
<b>Should I get rid of him?</b>

03:13.180 --> 03:14.170
<b>Ignore him.</b>

03:14.170 --> 03:15.420
<b>Don't look at him.</b>

03:15.870 --> 03:18.540
<b>Eh? This ain't no show!</b>

03:18.960 --> 03:21.680
<b>Damn, my future's <i>dark</i></b>

03:21.680 --> 03:23.730
<b>because of the failures working for me!</b>

03:24.590 --> 03:25.620
<b>Listen up!</b>

03:25.620 --> 03:27.560
<b>This once, I'll <i>close my eyes</i> 
like nothing happened.</b>

03:28.170 --> 03:30.560
<b>One more mistake, and you'll get it good!</b>

03:30.950 --> 03:32.320
<b>Now listen.</b>

03:32.320 --> 03:34.000
<b><i>Seven on the dot.</i></b>

03:34.000 --> 03:35.560
<b>You'd best be at the hotel by then!</b>

03:36.030 --> 03:37.120
<b><i>That's a message!</i></b>

03:37.610 --> 03:38.920
<b><i>Seven on the dot!</i></b>

03:38.920 --> 03:40.440
<b><i>Use darkness to our advantage!</i></b>

03:43.970 --> 03:45.500
<b><i>I can escape these threads instantly</i></b>

03:45.500 --> 03:47.250
<b><i>by dislocating my fingers.</i></b>

03:47.250 --> 03:49.490
<b><i>I'll need 0.7 seconds to attack.</i></b>

03:50.250 --> 03:51.470
<b><i>I'll have plenty of time!</i></b>

03:52.070 --> 03:53.830
<b><i>It'll take a few seconds before</i></b>

03:53.830 --> 03:55.650
<b><i>their eyes adjust to the dark</i></b>

03:55.650 --> 03:56.940
<b><i>if the lights suddenly go out!</i></b>

03:58.540 --> 04:00.460
<b>It's time for our last song.</b>

04:00.460 --> 04:03.250
<b>This request comes from Kicchomu-san.</b>

04:04.840 --> 04:06.100
<b><i>Three more minutes!</i></b>

04:06.720 --> 04:08.100
<b>Paku and the others are here.</b>

04:08.540 --> 04:09.370
<b>Oh?</b>

04:10.620 --> 04:13.350
<b>What's this? You got caught again?</b>

04:13.850 --> 04:15.750
<b>I get it...</b>

04:15.750 --> 04:18.730
<b>You changed your minds and 
decided to join, right?</b>

04:19.180 --> 04:24.090
<b>We didn't know that the reward 
for you guys was rescinded.</b>

04:24.090 --> 04:27.080
<b>So you screwed up again while stalking us?</b>

04:27.080 --> 04:28.740
<b>Didn't learn your lesson, huh?</b>

04:29.040 --> 04:31.720
<b>But this must be fate at work.</b>

04:32.740 --> 04:34.120
<b><i>Two more minutes.</i></b>

04:34.450 --> 04:36.880
<b>Well, let's be friends.</b>

04:36.880 --> 04:38.110
<b>No way.</b>

04:38.110 --> 04:40.480
<b>We were only following you for the reward.</b>

04:40.900 --> 04:43.880
<b>I wouldn't even want to look at your faces.</b>

04:44.350 --> 04:45.350
<b><i>Smart!</i></b>

04:45.350 --> 04:48.140
<b><i>Now we won't seem suspicious 
when we close our eyes.</i></b>

04:48.490 --> 04:49.790
<b>I agree.</b>

04:51.430 --> 04:52.780
<b>Well, boss?</b>

04:52.780 --> 04:54.140
<b>They've got guts, right?</b>

04:54.500 --> 04:57.150
<b>Their sass reminds me of Uvo.</b>

04:57.680 --> 04:59.450
<b>That's probably because they're kids.</b>

04:59.450 --> 05:01.520
<b>They know no fear.</b>

05:01.520 --> 05:03.840
<b>Anyway, describe the chain user for us.</b>

05:04.390 --> 05:05.770
<b>First things first, Paku.</b>

05:06.180 --> 05:07.910
<b>Check these kids again.</b>

05:09.180 --> 05:11.540
<b>Okay, what do you want to know?</b>

05:12.510 --> 05:15.040
<b>What are they hiding?</b>

05:16.200 --> 05:19.060
<b><i>Damn, that's a smart question.</i></b>

05:19.060 --> 05:20.580
<b><i>Straight to the point,</i></b>

05:20.580 --> 05:23.290
<b><i>and he can learn all kinds 
of information from it.</i></b>

05:24.910 --> 05:26.870
<b>Well, there's only one minute left</b>

05:26.870 --> 05:29.460
<b>in this week's broadcast.</b>

05:29.460 --> 05:31.810
<b><i>One minute! We have to buy time!</i></b>

05:32.400 --> 05:33.560
<b>It's no use.</b>

05:34.170 --> 05:35.350
<b>Your power</b>

05:35.350 --> 05:38.890
<b>lets you draw out memories 
from those you touch, right?</b>

05:39.440 --> 05:42.480
<b>We aren't hiding anything, 
and we know no—</b>

05:43.280 --> 05:45.140
<b>I'll know the truth soon enough.</b>

05:45.140 --> 05:46.320
<b>Shut up.</b>

05:46.630 --> 05:47.860
<b>Even if we did know something,</b>

05:47.860 --> 05:50.480
<b>we could think about something else,</b>

05:50.480 --> 05:51.700
<b>and hide it from you!</b>

05:52.130 --> 05:54.200
<b>Yep, there you go.</b>

05:54.690 --> 05:57.120
<b>You seem to be confused.</b>

05:57.120 --> 06:01.350
<b>I draw out the purest essence of human memory.</b>

06:02.180 --> 06:05.210
<b>I'm not browsing through 
the images in your mind.</b>

06:06.350 --> 06:10.450
<b>My question will stimulate your memory,</b>

06:10.450 --> 06:13.420
<b>stirring up the dirt collected in its depths</b>

06:13.420 --> 06:16.400
<b>like throwing a stone into a pond.</b>

06:16.400 --> 06:20.350
<b>The dirt represents your pure, 
unaltered memories.</b>

06:20.880 --> 06:22.560
<b>And I simply scoop them up.</b>

06:23.730 --> 06:25.640
<b>It's impossible to deceive me.</b>

06:26.240 --> 06:28.060
<b>I'll see you next week.</b>

06:28.510 --> 06:30.890
<b>This is JFN, and it's 7:00 PM.</b>

06:30.890 --> 06:31.490
<b><i>Here it comes!</i></b>

06:33.150 --> 06:35.490
<b>Now, it's time to ask my question.</b>

06:36.060 --> 06:37.840
<b>What are you hiding?</b>

06:42.930 --> 06:43.960
<b><i>I can see them!</i></b>

06:43.960 --> 06:45.390
<b><i>And they can't see us!</i></b>

06:52.180 --> 06:53.810
<b><i>The kid on the right is free?</i></b>

06:54.190 --> 06:54.850
<b><i>I can't see!</i></b>

06:55.490 --> 06:57.020
<b><i>This was their plan?</i></b>

06:58.810 --> 07:00.190
<b><i>I won't let go of the other one!</i></b>

07:02.110 --> 07:02.650
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

07:05.700 --> 07:07.900
<b><i>To break the thread, I'll have to kill her!</i></b>

07:11.150 --> 07:12.650
<b><i>I can't pull out my hand...</i></b>

07:12.650 --> 07:13.910
<b><i>She trapped it with her muscles!</i></b>

07:15.280 --> 07:16.290
<b>You're mine.</b>

07:16.730 --> 07:19.440
<b>Once you reveal your presence, 
I can sense you.</b>

07:19.440 --> 07:21.290
<b>Using the dark was meaningless.</b>

07:21.680 --> 07:22.500
<b>Killua!</b>

07:26.870 --> 07:28.300
<b>Give up.</b>

07:31.130 --> 07:32.580
<b>A pity...</b>

07:33.010 --> 07:35.550
<b>Well, it was a good shot.</b>

07:38.280 --> 07:39.770
<b>It came from the entrance?</b>

07:40.420 --> 07:42.270
<b>The guy with the radio was 
working with them.</b>

07:42.700 --> 07:43.700
<b>Forget him!</b>

07:44.280 --> 07:45.930
<b>We only need these two.</b>

07:46.480 --> 07:48.270
<b>Our eyes will adjust shortly.</b>

07:48.270 --> 07:49.210
<b>Yes.</b>

07:49.210 --> 07:50.780
<b>Wait, where's the boss?</b>

07:57.530 --> 07:58.910
<b>The boss is gone...</b>

08:02.010 --> 08:03.910
<b>Shizuku, hold this guy for me.</b>

08:03.910 --> 08:04.500
<b>Sure.</b>

08:04.960 --> 08:06.490
<b>Paku, are you okay?</b>

08:06.490 --> 08:08.750
<b>He broke my left hand and a molar...</b>

08:09.560 --> 08:11.530
<b>We underestimated them.</b>

08:12.350 --> 08:14.160
<b>Anyway, this is going to shock you.</b>

08:14.160 --> 08:14.990
<b>These kids are—</b>

08:14.840 --> 08:15.890
<b>Wait!</b>

08:17.660 --> 08:20.390
<b>Pakunoda, this is for you.</b>

08:20.660 --> 08:23.390
<b>Discuss their memories, and I'll kill him.</b>

08:28.920 --> 08:31.740
<b>Hey, what's going on?</b>

08:31.740 --> 08:35.110
<b><i>We missed him because he was 
disguised as a receptionist!</i></b>

08:35.560 --> 08:38.290
<b><i>And, wait... the boss should have</i></b>

08:38.290 --> 08:42.880
<b><i>been able to evade a chain 
attack from that distance.</i></b>

08:42.880 --> 08:45.420
<b><i>But the abrupt plunge</i></b>

08:45.420 --> 08:49.080
<b><i>into darkness delayed his reactions.</i></b>

08:49.080 --> 08:52.640
<b><i>This was all planned out!</i></b>

<b><i>And there's one more question...</i></b>

09:01.710 --> 09:05.850
<b><i>If these kids knew the chain user all along,</i></b>

09:05.850 --> 09:09.130
<b><i>why didn't my previous questioning 
trigger any memories?</i></b>

09:09.600 --> 09:12.950
<b><i>He must have been hiding his powers</i></b>

09:12.950 --> 09:15.520
<b><i>from his own allies!</i></b>

09:16.080 --> 09:19.620
<b><i>From all that, we can surmise 
that he is most likely intelligent,</i></b>

09:19.620 --> 09:25.240
<b><i>quick on his feet, secretive, 
and level headed.</i></b>

09:26.490 --> 09:29.240
<b><i>He probably isn't bluffing.</i></b>

09:29.770 --> 09:35.220
<b><i>He was prepared to sacrifice a few 
seconds to leave this message.</i></b>

09:35.560 --> 09:38.790
<b><i>Which means the message must be true.</i></b>

09:39.880 --> 09:42.530
<b><i>His ally can read human emotion</i></b>

09:42.530 --> 09:45.320
<b><i>by listening to heartbeats.</i></b>

09:45.320 --> 09:49.230
<b><i>That ally is the reason he 
left this message behind.</i></b>

09:50.040 --> 09:54.990
<b><i>If I talk, he'll sacrifice his own 
allies and kill the boss.</i></b>

09:55.620 --> 10:00.560
<b><i>But that also means that these 
kids are valuable as hostages.</i></b>

10:00.560 --> 10:01.330
<b>Paku.</b>

10:01.330 --> 10:03.260
<b><i>We have a chance to rescue the boss.</i></b>

10:03.260 --> 10:03.910
<b>Paku...</b>

10:03.910 --> 10:04.420
<b><i>But...</i></b>

10:04.420 --> 10:05.290
<b>Paku!</b>

10:07.850 --> 10:09.880
<b>Don't say a word.</b>

10:10.430 --> 10:11.380
<b>Got it?</b>

10:13.310 --> 10:16.300
<b>Machi, focus on your threads.</b>

10:16.300 --> 10:17.630
<b>I'll take him for you.</b>

10:18.430 --> 10:20.010
<b><i>Kurapika pulled it off.</i></b>

10:20.660 --> 10:22.330
<b>Since he left us a message,</b>

10:22.330 --> 10:24.720
<b>he'll contact us again.</b>

10:25.310 --> 10:29.310
<b>Until then, these kids are valuable hostages.</b>

10:30.310 --> 10:31.270
<b><i>I am the head,</i></b>

10:31.270 --> 10:33.660
<b><i>and you are the legs of the spider.</i></b>

10:34.290 --> 10:38.730
<b><i>Natural law dictates that the 
legs blindly follow the head.</i></b>

10:39.380 --> 10:42.480
<b><i>However, this simply represents 
a chain of command.</i></b>

10:42.480 --> 10:44.260
<b><i>It doesn't apply to my life or death.</i></b>

10:45.030 --> 10:48.200
<b><i>If I happen to die, one of you can replace me.</i></b>

10:48.720 --> 10:52.920
<b><i>And there may come a time when a leg 
has more importance than the head.</i></b>

10:53.440 --> 10:54.930
<b><i>Make the right call.</i></b>

10:55.540 --> 10:57.480
<b><i>My orders are top priority.</i></b>

10:57.480 --> 11:00.430
<b><i>However, I am not your top priority.</i></b>

11:01.540 --> 11:03.640
<b><i>Our goal is not to keep an individual alive,</i></b>

11:04.510 --> 11:06.000
<b><i>but the spider.</i></b>

11:06.000 --> 11:07.390
<b><i>Never forget that.</i></b>

11:07.880 --> 11:09.690
<b><i>What should we do in this situation?</i></b>

11:10.750 --> 11:14.440
<b><i>If I tell everyone the chain 
user's powers and weaknesses</i></b>

11:15.380 --> 11:18.320
<b><i>that I learned, we can defeat him.</i></b>

11:18.320 --> 11:19.580
<b><i>With ease.</i></b>

11:19.980 --> 11:23.700
<b><i>But that will probably lead 
to the boss' death.</i></b>

11:24.630 --> 11:26.450
<b><i>Uvo must have faced a similar decision.</i></b>

11:27.200 --> 11:28.550
<b><i>He died for the spider.</i></b>

11:29.240 --> 11:30.210
<b><i>Died?</i></b>

11:31.730 --> 11:34.010
<b><i>What did that fortune from the boss say?</i></b>

11:35.250 --> 11:42.220
<b>On a dark day with very little light, 
you will face two choices within a small room. 
You must choose between pride and betrayal. 
While the death-bringer hovers near.</b>

11:35.630 --> 11:36.680
<b><i>Two choices...</i></b>

11:37.430 --> 11:39.520
<b><i>Would it be considered betrayal to speak?</i></b>

11:39.980 --> 11:42.220
<b><i>Or would it be considered betrayal to lie?</i></b>

11:43.070 --> 11:44.720
<b><i>It is the spider that must be kept alive.</i></b>

11:45.790 --> 11:46.760
<b><i>Right...</i></b>

11:47.490 --> 11:48.820
<b><i>I'm thinking too hard.</i></b>

11:50.280 --> 11:50.890
<b>Paku,</b>

11:51.960 --> 11:54.010
<b>don't worry about it too much.</b>

11:54.560 --> 11:56.400
<b>Just keep your mouth shut.</b>

11:59.820 --> 12:01.360
<b>Hurry, Phinks!</b>

12:01.360 --> 12:02.680
<b>The boss has been captured!</b>

12:03.140 --> 12:04.290
<b><i>Boss...</i></b>

12:05.330 --> 12:08.160
<b><i>We still need you.</i></b>

12:09.300 --> 12:11.040
<b><i>Even if it means</i></b>

12:11.040 --> 12:13.600
<b><i>I must betray the spider.</i></b>

12:24.290 --> 12:25.260
<b>It's okay.</b>

12:25.840 --> 12:28.370
<b>A number of the enemies were injured.</b>

12:28.370 --> 12:30.260
<b>They won't move until reinforcements arrive.</b>

12:31.580 --> 12:32.980
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

12:32.980 --> 12:33.770
<b>Nothing.</b>

12:34.410 --> 12:37.060
<b>I didn't expect the chain user to be a woman.</b>

12:37.550 --> 12:39.020
<b>Did I say that I was?</b>

12:39.480 --> 12:41.920
<b>You shouldn't let appearances deceive you.</b>

12:42.600 --> 12:44.530
<b>Anyway, you should watch what you say.</b>

12:45.050 --> 12:48.720
<b>Since it may be the last 
thing out of your mouth.</b>

12:48.720 --> 12:50.250
<b>You won't kill me.</b>

12:50.850 --> 12:53.160
<b>You left your precious friends behind.</b>

12:53.440 --> 12:57.710
<b>I'm not so composed that 
I will ignore your taunts!</b>

12:57.710 --> 12:58.790
<b>Kurapika!</b>

12:59.740 --> 13:00.550
<b>That's enough.</b>

13:01.120 --> 13:03.960
<b>The girl's fortune didn't mention this.</b>

13:04.470 --> 13:06.270
<b>Therefore, this event</b>

13:06.270 --> 13:10.560
<b>isn't significant enough to matter.</b>

13:11.200 --> 13:12.100
<b>You bastard!</b>

13:12.320 --> 13:13.350
<b>Kurapika!</b>

13:13.350 --> 13:16.370
<b>If you kill him, I'll kick your ass!</b>

13:17.100 --> 13:18.820
<b>Do you need further explanation?</b>

13:19.390 --> 13:21.570
<b>I consider this situation</b>

13:21.570 --> 13:24.740
<b>the same as an afternoon coffee break.</b>

13:25.140 --> 13:26.870
<b>A peaceful outing.</b>

13:30.100 --> 13:31.990
<b>Calm down, Kurapika!</b>

13:32.270 --> 13:33.560
<b>We're on equal footing now!</b>

13:33.940 --> 13:35.780
<b>Nothing has changed.</b>

13:35.780 --> 13:36.680
<b>Equal footing?</b>

13:37.180 --> 13:39.250
<b>You are sorely mistaken.</b>

13:39.840 --> 13:41.930
<b>First of all, you've made 
the wrong assumption.</b>

13:42.810 --> 13:45.130
<b>I have no value as a hostage.</b>

13:45.380 --> 13:48.670
<b>If you insist on babbling...</b>

13:48.670 --> 13:49.850
<b>He isn't lying.</b>

13:50.380 --> 13:53.350
<b>Everything he says is true.</b>

13:53.650 --> 13:55.140
<b>There you go.</b>

13:55.450 --> 13:56.800
<b>This is reality.</b>

13:57.710 --> 13:59.860
<b>You people are the ones on the ropes.</b>

14:00.370 --> 14:01.620
<b>What do you mean?</b>

14:01.620 --> 14:04.150
<b>His heartbeat is normal.</b>

14:04.150 --> 14:05.860
<b>He isn't shaken by any of this.</b>

14:06.590 --> 14:09.890
<b>He isn't worried or frightened of death.</b>

14:10.470 --> 14:12.230
<b>I can hear that he's accepted death.</b>

14:12.760 --> 14:15.870
<b>I can hear that he walks 
with death every day.</b>

14:16.840 --> 14:19.510
<b>How is he capable of producing such a sound?</b>

14:19.510 --> 14:20.930
<b>No more!</b>

14:20.930 --> 14:22.540
<b>I can't take any more of this!</b>

14:22.540 --> 14:25.010
<b>I don't want to listen to you or him!</b>

14:25.540 --> 14:26.910
<b>Melody...</b>

14:26.910 --> 14:31.060
<b>He truly believes that he has 
no value as a hostage.</b>

14:31.670 --> 14:34.520
<b>But the fact remains that he is the leader.</b>

14:36.030 --> 14:37.270
<b>What are you...</b>

14:38.680 --> 14:40.910
<b>What are you people?</b>

14:42.810 --> 14:43.950
<b>The spider.</b>

14:47.540 --> 14:48.780
<b>Explain.</b>

14:49.140 --> 14:50.300
<b>The lights went out.</b>

14:50.730 --> 14:52.910
<b>The boss was taken in that instant.</b>

14:53.360 --> 14:55.490
<b>Here's the message from the chain user.</b>

14:55.980 --> 14:58.160
<b>Why didn't you go after him immediately?</b>

14:58.570 --> 15:00.460
<b>Machi and Paku were injured.</b>

15:00.460 --> 15:01.350
<b>So?</b>

15:01.350 --> 15:04.420
<b>He has allies who are pro Hunters.</b>

15:04.720 --> 15:05.670
<b>So?</b>

15:06.000 --> 15:08.010
<b>Read between the lines!</b>

15:08.410 --> 15:11.180
<b>It proves we can use these kids as hostages.</b>

15:11.550 --> 15:14.990
<b>If we give chase and let 
them escape, it's over!</b>

15:15.490 --> 15:17.760
<b>The boss has probably been captured</b>

15:17.760 --> 15:20.130
<b>by those chains that Uvo couldn't break.</b>

15:20.550 --> 15:22.400
<b>It'll be difficult for him to escape on his own!</b>

15:22.400 --> 15:23.740
<b>Probably?</b>

15:23.740 --> 15:25.440
<b>The lights went out!</b>

15:26.000 --> 15:28.670
<b>By the time our eyes adjusted, 
the boss was gone.</b>

15:28.670 --> 15:31.450
<b>We weren't in any condition to move.</b>

15:31.720 --> 15:34.230
<b>Okay, we can assign blame later.</b>

15:34.230 --> 15:35.950
<b>For now, we need a plan.</b>

15:37.030 --> 15:40.960
<b>Five years ago, were you the 
leader when the Troupe</b>

15:41.430 --> 15:44.010
<b>slaughtered the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?</b>

15:46.100 --> 15:47.190
<b>Answer me!</b>

15:49.380 --> 15:51.680
<b>Are those the chains you used to kill Uvo?</b>

15:53.480 --> 15:55.860
<b>What were Uvo's last words?</b>

15:55.860 --> 15:57.180
<b>I don't remember.</b>

15:57.430 --> 15:58.610
<b>You're lying.</b>

15:58.610 --> 16:00.510
<b>Am I right, miss?</b>

16:01.480 --> 16:03.180
<b>I can relate.</b>

16:03.180 --> 16:04.420
<b>I feel the same way.</b>

16:04.940 --> 16:07.170
<b>I have nothing to say to you.</b>

16:07.170 --> 16:08.690
<b>Kurapika, he's trying to provoke you!</b>

16:08.690 --> 16:09.680
<b>Don't fall for it!</b>

16:08.690 --> 16:09.680
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

16:10.110 --> 16:11.110
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

16:12.360 --> 16:13.700
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

16:17.650 --> 16:19.310
<b><i>That proves it.</i></b>

16:20.810 --> 16:22.460
<b><i>I'm quite surprised.</i></b>

16:23.270 --> 16:25.400
<b><i>The chain user has an exploitable weakness.</i></b>

16:25.840 --> 16:28.130
<b><i>I can use this.</i></b>

16:32.940 --> 16:34.230
<b>It's the boss.</b>

16:36.180 --> 16:37.090
<b>Hello?</b>

16:38.240 --> 16:39.950
<b>I have three demands.</b>

16:39.950 --> 16:41.230
<b>The chain user?</b>

16:41.540 --> 16:44.850
<b>The general rule is that my 
demands are absolute.</b>

16:44.850 --> 16:48.230
<b>If you don't obey, I will kill 
your leader immediately.</b>

16:48.860 --> 16:51.470
<b>First, do not follow me.</b>

16:51.470 --> 16:54.990
<b>Second, do not harm your two hostages.</b>

16:55.550 --> 16:58.270
<b>Third, put that Pakunoda woman on the phone.</b>

16:58.270 --> 17:00.010
<b>Can I ask you something first?</b>

17:00.370 --> 17:01.500
<b>It's about the second demand.</b>

17:02.000 --> 17:04.140
<b>The two hostages put up a struggle,</b>

17:04.140 --> 17:06.880
<b>and we had to break a few bones.</b>

17:08.880 --> 17:10.800
<b>Then we're done negotiating.</b>

17:14.410 --> 17:15.160
<b>What is it?</b>

17:15.160 --> 17:16.780
<b>Sorry, I was lying.</b>

17:16.780 --> 17:18.010
<b>Both of them are unharmed.</b>

17:18.270 --> 17:19.690
<b>This is your last chance.</b>

17:19.690 --> 17:21.470
<b>Do not fool around.</b>

17:21.470 --> 17:23.140
<b>Put Pakunoda on the phone.</b>

17:23.370 --> 17:24.770
<b>Ow!</b>

17:25.460 --> 17:26.650
<b>Hello?</b>

17:27.370 --> 17:30.540
<b>You are the only one allowed 
to hear what I say.</b>

17:30.540 --> 17:32.080
<b>Move away from the others.</b>

17:35.600 --> 17:38.000
<b>Did you make contact with 
a man named Squala?</b>

17:38.000 --> 17:38.860
<b>Yes.</b>

17:38.860 --> 17:41.240
<b>Are you aware of a woman named Melody?</b>

17:41.240 --> 17:42.300
<b>I am.</b>

17:42.300 --> 17:43.570
<b>Then this will be quick.</b>

17:44.040 --> 17:45.110
<b>Listen carefully.</b>

17:45.110 --> 17:48.540
<b>You are forbidden from 
communicating with your comrades.</b>

17:48.960 --> 17:53.950
<b>No talking, gesturing, writing, 
signaling, or making eye contact.</b>

17:53.950 --> 17:55.240
<b>None of that is allowed.</b>

17:55.750 --> 17:59.450
<b>You must come alone to 
the place I designate.</b>

17:59.870 --> 18:03.940
<b>If your heart rate changes even in 
the slightest, I will kill the hostage.</b>

18:03.940 --> 18:05.060
<b>Understood?</b>

18:06.310 --> 18:09.310
<b>Now give the phone to someone 
besides the previous man.</b>

18:10.610 --> 18:12.190
<b>I'm here.</b>

18:12.190 --> 18:14.230
<b>I'm going to meet with Pakunoda alone.</b>

18:14.230 --> 18:16.690
<b>The rest of you must return to your hideout.</b>

18:16.690 --> 18:18.950
<b>All ten Troupe members must be there.</b>

18:18.950 --> 18:22.090
<b>If a single one is missing, I will kill the hostage.</b>

18:22.090 --> 18:23.000
<b>Understood?</b>

18:23.000 --> 18:23.820
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:24.460 --> 18:26.180
<b>Put Pakunoda back on.</b>

18:26.710 --> 18:27.460
<b>Here.</b>

18:28.360 --> 18:30.680
<b>You're to come to Lingon Airport.</b>

18:30.680 --> 18:32.080
<b>You have until 8:00.</b>

18:32.760 --> 18:35.510
<b>And you must come alone.</b>

18:36.630 --> 18:38.390
<b><i>Don't hesitate, Pakunoda.</i></b>

18:38.390 --> 18:39.470
<b><i>Bring everyone.</i></b>

18:40.110 --> 18:43.470
<b><i>He'll put his friends before his mission.</i></b>

18:43.680 --> 18:44.950
<b>Hey, Paku!</b>

18:44.950 --> 18:46.230
<b>Wait!</b>

18:46.780 --> 18:48.540
<b>Let Paku go by herself.</b>

18:49.000 --> 18:50.600
<b>We're returning to the hideout.</b>

18:50.920 --> 18:52.500
<b>Orders from the chain user.</b>

18:52.500 --> 18:54.220
<b>What's your point?</b>

18:54.220 --> 18:57.230
<b>If we disobey, he'll kill the boss!</b>

18:57.230 --> 18:58.490
<b>Are you an idiot?</b>

18:59.100 --> 19:01.410
<b>If that happens, we kill the chain user.</b>

19:01.410 --> 19:02.490
<b>And that will be the end.</b>

19:02.790 --> 19:05.490
<b>It's what the boss would tell us to do.</b>

19:05.860 --> 19:10.000
<b><i>Nobunaga, you insult the spider.</i></b>

19:10.260 --> 19:13.320
<b>We have to follow Pakunoda now.</b>

19:13.320 --> 19:15.100
<b>This is an absolute necessity!</b>

19:15.100 --> 19:16.430
<b>I concur.</b>

19:16.430 --> 19:18.760
<b>There's no point in letting Paku go alone.</b>

19:19.160 --> 19:21.530
<b>If we continue to follow his orders,</b>

19:21.530 --> 19:23.260
<b>the fortunes will come true.</b>

19:23.610 --> 19:25.570
<b>I agree with Nobunaga.</b>

19:26.150 --> 19:28.450
<b>We should follow his orders for now.</b>

19:28.450 --> 19:29.270
<b>I agree.</b>

19:29.270 --> 19:30.680
<b>For now?</b>

19:30.680 --> 19:32.580
<b>How long do we listen to him?</b>

19:32.580 --> 19:34.890
<b>Until half our limbs are gone?</b>

19:35.850 --> 19:37.530
<b>Shizuku, what do you think?</b>

19:37.870 --> 19:40.390
<b>When there's a fight, we flip a coin.</b>

19:40.390 --> 19:42.660
<b>He's broken the rules.</b>

19:43.590 --> 19:45.900
<b>But I'll side with Nobunaga.</b>

19:45.900 --> 19:48.480
<b>I don't want the boss to die now.</b>

19:48.480 --> 19:49.910
<b>I don't want Paku to die, either.</b>

19:50.460 --> 19:52.420
<b>I'm sure Paku feels the same way.</b>

19:52.420 --> 19:55.740
<b>That's why she left without a word.</b>

19:56.560 --> 19:57.900
<b>I don't believe this...</b>

19:57.900 --> 19:59.560
<b>Talking to you is pointless.</b>

19:59.560 --> 20:02.370
<b>I would love to kill you right now,</b>

20:02.370 --> 20:04.050
<b>but following Pakunoda comes first.</b>

20:04.050 --> 20:05.300
<b>Wait!</b>

20:10.530 --> 20:12.700
<b>Take one more step,</b>

20:13.280 --> 20:14.310
<b>and I'll cut you down.</b>

20:17.070 --> 20:18.570
<b>Go ahead and try.</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:24.800
<b>Troupe members aren't allowed to fight.</b>

20:24.800 --> 20:27.330
<b>Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?</b>

20:27.330 --> 20:28.830
<b>That's what my heart says.</b>

20:29.150 --> 20:31.200
<b>But the rules are absolute.</b>

20:31.200 --> 20:33.480
<b>If we reject the rules, we reject the spider.</b>

20:33.480 --> 20:35.520
<b>And we also reject the boss.</b>

20:35.860 --> 20:37.460
<b>I don't want to do that.</b>

20:38.840 --> 20:39.890
<b>It's him.</b>

20:40.740 --> 20:41.840
<b>I'll take it.</b>

20:42.900 --> 20:43.710
<b>Hello—</b>

20:43.400 --> 20:44.970
<b>Put one of the hostages on the phone.</b>

20:45.760 --> 20:47.060
<b>You little...</b>

20:48.790 --> 20:49.890
<b>Here.</b>

20:50.530 --> 20:52.390
<b>Are they all together?</b>

20:52.390 --> 20:53.620
<b>They are right now.</b>

20:53.620 --> 20:56.480
<b>But they're talking about 
going after Pakunoda...</b>

20:56.800 --> 20:59.120
<b>Watch your mouth, kid.</b>

20:59.120 --> 21:00.120
<b>Hello?</b>

21:00.120 --> 21:02.240
<b>You have thirty minutes to 
return to your hideout.</b>

21:02.660 --> 21:06.740
<b>You can try trickery if you want, 
but your leader will die.</b>

21:07.250 --> 21:08.600
<b>I'll call again shortly.</b>

21:09.640 --> 21:11.850
<b>We won't be able to follow Paku now.</b>

21:11.850 --> 21:12.820
<b>Damn it!</b>

21:14.800 --> 21:18.630
<b>The boss will die if we ten aren't together?</b>

21:18.900 --> 21:23.630
<b>He's pretty smart to use the 
hostages as messengers.</b>

21:24.160 --> 21:26.900
<b><i>This is the perfect chance to fight the boss.</i></b>

21:26.900 --> 21:30.280
<b><i>But if I leave, the boss will die.</i></b>

21:30.280 --> 21:32.140
<b><i>There you have it.</i></b>

21:32.720 --> 21:34.420
<b><i>Lend me a hand.</i></b>

21:35.920 --> 21:36.930
<b>Sure.</b>

21:37.320 --> 21:40.280
<b>I've known you a little longer than Chrollo.</b>

21:43.000 --> 21:45.170
<b>Kurapika's revenge has come to fruition.</b>

21:45.170 --> 21:49.420
<b>And his confrontation with the 
Troupe has reached its final stage.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.630 --> 23:07.530
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.530 --> 23:08.360
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.360 --> 23:09.460
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.450 --> 23:19.920
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.460 --> 23:11.020
<b>Today, we introduce Pakunoda.</b>

23:10.760 --> 23:12.370
<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.020 --> 23:12.280
<b>A Specialist.</b>

23:12.280 --> 23:13.710
<b>Her power lets her see memories</b>

23:12.370 --> 23:13.870
<b>A Specialist.</b>

23:13.710 --> 23:15.090
<b>by touching people and objects.</b>

23:13.870 --> 23:19.920
<b>Her rare ability shows her
