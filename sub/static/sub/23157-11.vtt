WEBVTT

00:03.418 --> 00:06.353
- He's in trouble, Thomas. - What'd
he do, overcharge a tourist?

00:06.421 --> 00:08.719
He got caught smuggling
someone into the Islands.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.384
- Stand clear! - Take it easy.
I just wanna talk to my buddy.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.586
- Ain't no friends of mine.
- T.C...

00:13.661 --> 00:17.222
Hey, don't lay that "T.C." jive on me.
I said ya ain't my friends.

00:17.298 --> 00:19.960
He landed on board a ship,
refueled, and then headed back in.

00:20.034 --> 00:21.934
It's time for T.C. to get out of here.

00:23.771 --> 00:26.797
I'm not gonna let you do that, T.C.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.969
Hey! Hey! Cool it! Cool it!

02:04.513 --> 02:07.435
Joey, if you even suckered me...

02:24.276 --> 02:26.301
Lights, Capitaine.

02:29.381 --> 02:32.043
Get those floodlights on.

02:35.187 --> 02:38.054
Well, right on.

02:39.391 --> 02:42.588
Dead slow.
Dead slow. Aye, aye, sir.

03:13.058 --> 03:15.618
All right, get those pumps in,
on the double.!

03:15.694 --> 03:18.822
Hand pumps?

03:18.898 --> 03:22.834
Follow me. Come on, Murphy, move it.!
Let's get those tanks full.!

03:30.075 --> 03:33.442
Do you know how long it's gonna take
them to fill my tanks usin' hand pumps?

03:33.512 --> 03:35.912
Thirty or 40 minutes.
Thirty or 40...

03:35.981 --> 03:39.576
Man, if I'm not outta here in 10, it's
gonna be dawn by the time I get to Oahu.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.085
I'm sorry. Great.

03:41.153 --> 03:44.020
Great. I'll tell that to
the Coast Guard if they catch me.

03:44.089 --> 03:47.388
You can, uh... You can stay
until tonight, if you wish.

03:47.459 --> 03:51.259
Hey, man, I'm serious.
It's just a suggestion.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.325
Where's Joey? He's below.

03:57.403 --> 04:02.306
Perhaps, uh, you'd like to see him
while your helicopter's being refueled.

04:02.374 --> 04:04.535
Ain't no "" perhaps" about it.

04:06.845 --> 04:09.405
Take him to
the boy's cabin, Spark.

04:34.073 --> 04:37.372
T.C.! Oh!

04:37.443 --> 04:41.470
You clean, boy?
Ever since I called you, man.

04:43.582 --> 04:48.246
Look. Just old ones.
Nothing fresh.

05:10.342 --> 05:14.574
See? See, T.C.?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.475
Oh!

05:24.156 --> 05:28.115
Come on, Joey boy. Let's go home.
Oh!

06:01.393 --> 06:04.453
Any chance he'll land on, uh,
one of the other islands?

06:04.530 --> 06:08.899
No. He has only enough petrol to take
this direct route to Oahu.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.959
All the other islands
are beyond his range.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.403
And the flight will take
three hours, n'est-ce pas?

06:14.473 --> 06:16.236
Oui.

06:16.308 --> 06:20.506
Send the S.O.S.,
giving this position, in one hour.

06:20.579 --> 06:22.570
Very good.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.786
After Saigon fell,
I went to Thailand.

06:36.862 --> 06:40.821
Things weren't any better there.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.163
I sold a little morphine...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:43.235 --> 06:45.931
I don't wanna know nothin'.
What I don't know, I don't know.

06:46.004 --> 06:49.405
I'm-I'm sorry, T.C.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.443
I'm just a little nervous, I guess.

06:51.510 --> 06:55.708
I mean, I don't know, running all the
time... it kind of gets you that way.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.811
You know, it's been some time
since you went over the hill.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.412
Maybe you oughta consider
turnin' yourself in.

07:04.490 --> 07:08.256
Oh-Oh, no.
No, I couldn't make it in prison.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.625
You know that, T.C.
I-I couldn't make it in prison.

07:10.696 --> 07:14.223
Yeah, well, you ain't doin' so damn hot
on the outside either, boy.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.290
Hey... No! I mean,

07:16.368 --> 07:19.064
you're not gonna pull this "" turning
me in for my own good" stuff on me.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.504
'Cause... Come on, man.
I'll jump.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.040
I'll kill myself!

07:23.108 --> 07:25.008
All right! All right!
Stop it! Stop it!

07:25.077 --> 07:29.537
Now, would I be riskin' my life flyin'
at 50 feet if I was gonna turn you in?

07:29.615 --> 07:33.346
All right. Now, I'm gonna do
what I promised to do.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.557
Then it's quits between you and me,
you hear?

07:45.330 --> 07:47.195
- Wh-What?
- I said, quits.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.437
I mean, you can't run forever, boy.
And someday, you're gonna figure that out.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.742
But until you do,
don't you turn to me again.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.608
'Cause if you do,
I won't be there to help you, all right?

08:00.679 --> 08:03.375
Okay.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.383
Just-Just get me home.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.881
That's all I... I want.

08:11.957 --> 08:13.891
I just wanna go home.

08:17.463 --> 08:20.023
Yeah, man, that's what
I'm tryin' to do.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.177
I'm picking up a distress signal, sir.

08:32.244 --> 08:34.940
What are the coordinates?
Yawl Britannia,

08:35.013 --> 08:38.539
161 degrees,

08:38.616 --> 08:43.577
ten minutes, west longitude.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.714
Seventeen degrees,

08:45.791 --> 08:48.783
twelve minutes,

08:48.861 --> 08:51.159
north latitude. Okay..

08:51.230 --> 08:54.927
Sinking fast.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.494
Three crew members, five passengers.
Got it.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.808
How much longer?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.902
About 50 minutes.

09:06.979 --> 09:11.075
If you look close, you can see
the Big Island at about 3:00.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.314
Oh, yeah, I can just see it.

09:15.387 --> 09:19.585
After eight years,
the good old U.S.A.

09:19.658 --> 09:22.320
The world, man.

09:22.394 --> 09:25.989
Uh-oh. What?

09:26.064 --> 09:29.192
Looks like we got
a welcoming committee.

09:30.702 --> 09:33.694
It's a white C-130.

09:33.772 --> 09:36.332
Coast Guard
search and rescue plane.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.808
They must be out here
lookin' for someone in trouble.

09:38.877 --> 09:41.971
Now what do we do?
Pray they don't spot us.

09:42.047 --> 09:45.676
Barbers Point, Rescue One.
Still no sign of that yawl.

09:45.751 --> 09:51.314
But we've got a chopper... a Hughes 500-D,
low on the deck, headed toward Oahu.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.655
Scramble the ready helicopter
to intercept.

09:54.726 --> 09:58.162
And contact the marines at "" K" base.
Might need their assistance.

10:00.532 --> 10:02.557
I don't know what he's up to,
but whatever it is...

10:02.634 --> 10:05.228
I bet a month's pay it isn't legal.
Yes, sir.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.873
You think they saw us?

10:08.941 --> 10:13.037
Uh-huh.
Well, you can't be sure, T.C.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.136
Oh, yes, I can.

10:18.216 --> 10:21.913
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm not gonna let them take me alive.

10:21.987 --> 10:23.978
I'm gonna jump first. I
told you... Cool it, man!

10:24.056 --> 10:27.753
Cool it.! They ain't caught you yet.! Now, one
more word out of you, you won't have tojump.

10:27.826 --> 10:31.159
I'll push you out.
I said I was gonna get you home,

10:31.229 --> 10:33.527
and that's what I'm gonna do.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.792
Suck it up, man. Here we go.

11:20.212 --> 11:23.079
Sir, he's gone underneath us.
Let's radio for help.

11:23.148 --> 11:27.209
Hold on, Joey.
I am, T.C. Just get me down.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.231
Get ready to split.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.239
Joey, man, you're clean.
Why don't you turn yourself in?

11:50.308 --> 11:52.242
If you do,
I'll go to the wall with you.

11:52.310 --> 11:55.143
You gotta stop runnin'
and be a man sometime!

11:55.213 --> 11:57.738
I never did have the guts to be a man!

11:57.816 --> 11:59.681
Once! Except once!

11:59.751 --> 12:02.618
All right, then, man!
We're even!

12:17.235 --> 12:22.138
All right, hot shot.
Let's see just how good you really are.

12:27.546 --> 12:31.710
Aw, come on, guys.
That just ain't fair.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.617
Good morning, love.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.153
I didn't want to disturb you
when I left.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.712
You looked so cute
with your hair all tousled...

13:11.790 --> 13:13.724
and sucking your thumb.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.625
I'm only kidding, darling.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.629
I'll be back in three or four weeks,

13:18.697 --> 13:21.495
depending on what happens
at my meeting in Paris.

13:21.566 --> 13:24.262
I shall miss you, Thomas.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.669
I'll miss you too, Sarah.
You better.

13:31.576 --> 13:35.376
Sarah had left the same way she'd arrived...
without warning.

13:35.447 --> 13:39.315
Usually, her timing was perfect.
Just when I'd really begin to miss her,

13:39.384 --> 13:42.581
there she'd be sitting on my doorstep
with a big smile,

13:42.654 --> 13:44.884
sparkling eyes,
and in the middle of a conversation...

13:44.956 --> 13:47.754
as if we'd never been apart at all.

13:48.827 --> 13:52.285
As a literary agent, she was forever flying
to some corner of the world...

13:52.364 --> 13:55.663
to buy a hot manuscript
or soothe a ruffled author.

13:55.734 --> 13:59.932
And I kinda liked it that way,
until this morning.

14:00.005 --> 14:04.169
I hadn't wanted her
to leave this morning.

14:04.242 --> 14:08.110
You've got to promise me you won't
throw this one down the drain, Thomas.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.411
Promise? I promise.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.179
Anyway, Sarah is a health nut,
among other things,

14:14.252 --> 14:19.155
so she's always leaving me the recipe
for some absolutely awful concoction.

14:19.224 --> 14:21.215
This morning was no exception.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.657
After you've mixed in
the flat beer and tomato juice,

14:26.731 --> 14:30.098
add three raw eggs. What?

14:30.168 --> 14:33.831
I know you aren't going to
like that, but do it. Ew!

14:33.905 --> 14:38.001
And then blend at low speed
for ten seconds.

14:39.244 --> 14:42.372
I'll wait. So will I.

14:42.447 --> 14:44.438
Ooh.

14:46.885 --> 14:50.844
That's enough time.
Drink it all down like you promised.

14:50.922 --> 14:54.187
It'll help you regain
your strength, darling.

15:03.835 --> 15:06.668
Thomas.!

15:06.738 --> 15:09.639
Thomas! Damn!

15:09.708 --> 15:13.007
Those dogs are gonna kill somebody one
of these days. Hopefully, their masters.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.239
Why didn't you call? I would've arranged
some kind of diversion to distract them.

15:16.248 --> 15:21.185
Diversion? What is this, Vietnam?
And, besides, I tried.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.983
Oh. I'm sorry.
I just didn't wanna be disturbed.

15:24.055 --> 15:25.647
Uh-huh. "" Uh-huh."

15:25.724 --> 15:28.022
You're beginning to sound like T.C.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.460
Maybe that's because it's his fault that I had to
run this doggie gauntlet. He's in trouble, Thomas.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.963
Big trouble.
Like, he's in the brig.

15:34.032 --> 15:36.159
What'd he do, overcharge a tourist?
Worse.

15:36.234 --> 15:39.567
- He got caught smuggling someone into
the Islands. - Are you kidding me?

15:39.638 --> 15:43.369
I'm not kidding. It's serious enough that
the Coast Guard impounded his helicopter.

15:43.441 --> 15:46.672
They got him in the brig, and he's waiting
for federal marshals to pick him up.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.714
Why-Why didn't he call me?
Here, give me a second.

15:49.781 --> 15:52.181
Why didn't he call you?
Because your phone was off the hook.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.241
That's why.

15:57.622 --> 15:59.647
Mmm.

16:05.344 --> 16:07.278
Mmm!

16:20.946 --> 16:23.881
I'm sorry, T.C.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.777
I'm... sorry...

16:32.791 --> 16:34.782
T.C.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.891
T.C.?

16:58.592 --> 17:00.457
Hey, man, don't lay that
"T.C. '" number on me.

17:00.669 --> 17:03.160
- Hey, wait a minute.
- He doesn't wanna talk.

17:03.238 --> 17:05.137
- Yes, he does.
- No, I don't.

17:06.374 --> 17:09.343
I mean, I did something
I shouldn't have, and I got caught.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.902
So I'm gonna plead guilty and
throw myself on the mercy of the court.

17:11.980 --> 17:16.314
And I don't need
no Mutt and no Jeff to do that.

17:16.384 --> 17:19.147
Besides, even if I go to jail
I'll probably be better off,

17:19.221 --> 17:22.213
'cause then I won't have to worry about
you borrowin' almost everything I own...

17:22.290 --> 17:25.521
or gettin' me involved
in some of your silly cases.

17:25.594 --> 17:29.724
And I won't have to fly around those King
Kamehameha snobs of yours at reduced rates.

17:31.566 --> 17:33.830
Now, I got a mom and I got a papa,

17:33.902 --> 17:36.166
and I ain't lookin' for no more brothers.

17:36.238 --> 17:39.901
So why don't you two
get the hell out of my life?

17:41.810 --> 17:44.108
The both of you!

18:00.262 --> 18:03.356
The Coast Guard makes
the best coffee in the world, gentlemen.

18:03.431 --> 18:06.195
I think you two could use a cup.

18:06.268 --> 18:08.862
I think you're right.
Yeah, thanks.

18:08.937 --> 18:10.928
Come on in.

18:20.148 --> 18:22.742
Our search plane
spotted him here...

18:22.817 --> 18:25.479
about 150 nautical miles
southwest of Oahu.

18:25.553 --> 18:27.487
What the hell was he doin'
way out there?

18:27.555 --> 18:30.547
That's what I wondered.
It's beyond his round-trip fuel range.

18:30.625 --> 18:35.119
Unless, of course, he landed on board a
ship, refueled, and then headed back in.

18:35.196 --> 18:38.324
That's when I scrambled
Neal and his boys.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.836
We intercepted him up here
about 10 miles off Kaena Point.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.770
Did he rabbit? Not at first.

18:44.839 --> 18:46.932
He indicated he had radio trouble.

18:47.008 --> 18:50.375
When I signaled for him to follow us,
he swung right in alongside.

18:50.445 --> 18:52.413
He seemed calm enough,
but his passenger sure was scared.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.108
Neal, can you tell us
what his passenger looked like?

18:55.183 --> 18:57.481
Yeah, he was a little guy
in his 30s,

18:57.552 --> 19:00.248
and very nervous.
I don't understand, Neal.

19:00.322 --> 19:03.291
I mean, how'd you catch T.C.
and not this other guy?

19:03.358 --> 19:05.690
Your friend is crazy.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.196
He followed us nice and friendly-like
until we crossed Kepuhi Point.

19:09.264 --> 19:12.563
Then he went into a high-speed dive into a
valley that should've torn that chopper apart.

19:12.634 --> 19:17.401
By the time I caught up to him,
he'd let his passenger off in a clearing.

19:17.472 --> 19:20.352
I haven't seen flying like that since
Vietnam. That's where he learned it.

19:21.843 --> 19:24.334
Thanks. Sure.

19:24.412 --> 19:27.575
Lieutenant, Rick and I know T.C. real well.

19:27.649 --> 19:31.551
Now, I don't know why he doesn't want our help, but I
do know he wouldn't do anything illegal like this,

19:31.619 --> 19:33.917
no matter what he pleads in court.
We don't try 'em.

19:33.989 --> 19:36.184
We just catch 'em and turn 'em over
to the justice department.

19:36.257 --> 19:39.192
But I do know if he pleads guilty,
like he says,

19:39.260 --> 19:41.194
they'll, um,
they'll take his chopper...

19:41.262 --> 19:44.163
and they'll give him five to ten
in the federal pen.

19:44.232 --> 19:46.826
How'd you spot him?
Was it a routine search?

19:46.901 --> 19:48.835
A tip? Luck? What?

19:48.903 --> 19:51.770
More luck than anything else.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.741
We received a distress signal
from the yawl Brittania.

19:54.809 --> 19:57.004
They radioed that they were sinking,

19:57.078 --> 20:00.138
right about where we spotted T.C.

20:00.215 --> 20:02.149
Did you reach her
before she went under?

20:02.217 --> 20:05.618
No. We still have surface
and air vessels out seeking her.

20:05.687 --> 20:09.020
But we couldn't find a thing,
not even any debris.

20:09.090 --> 20:12.184
Maybe because she was never there.

20:15.263 --> 20:18.198
It's getting crowded nowadays.
Too many tourists.

20:18.266 --> 20:22.396
When I was a kid, I remember
you could come out here and fish.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.563
No haoles in a powerboat
to cut your lines.

20:24.639 --> 20:27.130
Now, all p"au hana.

20:27.208 --> 20:30.405
You can catch a ride
to the airport from here.

20:30.478 --> 20:33.106
No trouble. I, um...

20:33.181 --> 20:36.480
Hey, I changed my mind.
Is it all right if I go into town with you?

20:36.551 --> 20:40.078
Sure. Hey, I love company, brah.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.146
Let's go.

20:56.738 --> 20:59.935
Of course, I could've gone
to flight school myself,

21:00.008 --> 21:01.942
but I just didn't see any future in it.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.944
I mean, the advancements they've made...

21:04.012 --> 21:07.243
in electronics and computers
over the last ten years,

21:07.315 --> 21:10.045
pilots are about as archaic
as pterodactyls...

21:10.118 --> 21:12.916
and just about as useful.

21:12.987 --> 21:15.285
N-N...

21:15.356 --> 21:18.655
Naturally, I'm talking about navy pilots.

21:18.726 --> 21:22.025
The Marine Corps can always use
a few good men...

21:22.097 --> 21:24.088
who are pilots.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.195
Very good. Quick thinking.

21:27.268 --> 21:30.260
Probably why
you're in Naval Intelligence, Mac.

21:30.338 --> 21:33.466
Magnum, whatever it is,
the answer is no.

21:34.742 --> 21:37.210
Yeah, I'll have a beer,
and another scotch for my buddy here.

21:37.278 --> 21:40.076
Oh, no. Now I know
it's gonna be something bad.

21:40.148 --> 21:43.208
When you start ordering drinks,
you want the admiral's gig for a party.

21:43.284 --> 21:46.151
No, I don't.
Air Force One for the weekend?

21:46.221 --> 21:49.657
Mac, you got a great sense of humor.

21:49.724 --> 21:53.683
Then why ain't I laughin'?
Because you're paranoid.

21:53.761 --> 21:56.229
Thanks.

21:56.297 --> 21:58.891
Well, maybe I did misjudge you.

21:58.967 --> 22:00.935
Cheers. Down the hatch.

22:02.537 --> 22:04.505
Ahh.

22:04.572 --> 22:06.733
Tough day? The usual.

22:09.611 --> 22:12.671
Hey, tell me, Mac, is that...

22:12.747 --> 22:17.116
is that Brownie in KH-14 still pickin' up
nude sunbathers on the Baltic?

22:17.185 --> 22:19.119
Yeah. We got a...

22:19.187 --> 22:21.655
We got a photo the other day
of a girl with a...

22:24.192 --> 22:28.288
Oh, no, you don't!

22:30.298 --> 22:32.129
Mac.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.101
Hey, you gotta be nuts. Insane.
Look, they're gonna court-martial me.

22:35.170 --> 22:37.195
They're gonna throw me in the brig.
You're talkin' treason.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.604
Mac, just hear me out, that's all.
No!

22:39.674 --> 22:42.040
Look, KH-14 is top secret.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.044
Mac, I used to have your job, remember?

22:44.112 --> 22:46.137
I used to evaluate photos
from KH-14.

22:46.214 --> 22:48.842
When you were in Navy Intelligence,
which you aren't anymore...

22:48.917 --> 22:51.181
unless they changed the uniforms
and didn't tell me about it.

22:51.252 --> 22:54.551
That satellite can photograph the rivets
off a Russian ship from 10,000 miles up.

22:54.622 --> 22:57.648
Oh, stop it! Everybody knows that.
It's no big secret.

22:57.725 --> 23:00.193
I also know its orbit sweeps
the Hawaiian chain every four hours.

23:00.261 --> 23:02.195
Well, you know too damn much!

23:02.263 --> 23:04.663
Mac, listen to me. Come on. Mac.
I got a buddy who's in trouble.

23:04.732 --> 23:07.132
Big trouble. Hey, hey, Magnum,
wait a... I don't wanna know this.

23:07.202 --> 23:10.865
Okay, fine, fine. You don't have to
know that. But I need some information.

23:10.939 --> 23:12.930
Specific information.

23:13.007 --> 23:15.840
I need to know if there were any ships
large enough for a chopper to land...

23:15.910 --> 23:19.402
250 to 300 nautical miles
southwest of Oahu...

23:19.480 --> 23:21.948
between midnight last night
and dawn... that's all.

23:22.016 --> 23:24.382
That's all? Yeah, I'm not
interested in any military ships.

23:24.452 --> 23:27.182
Just merchantmen.
Oh, and if there was a yacht...

23:27.255 --> 23:29.553
at some coordinates that I'll give you.
Anything else?

23:29.624 --> 23:32.855
No, I just want the enhanced photos
of the freighters or the tankers.

23:32.927 --> 23:34.861
And the yacht if it exists.

23:36.564 --> 23:38.555
No.

23:40.768 --> 23:43.760
Mac, I got a buddy who saved my life
so many times in 'Nam...

23:43.838 --> 23:46.398
I can't even count
about to do ten years...

23:46.474 --> 23:48.874
for something I know
he couldn't have done.

23:48.943 --> 23:51.639
Look, it has nothing to do
with military operations.

23:51.713 --> 23:54.147
I can get the same information
from the shipping companies.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.740
But it'd just take too long.
Magnum, with your sense of bull,

23:56.818 --> 23:59.013
you could've been admiral.

24:02.257 --> 24:04.191
Can you give me her name?

24:04.259 --> 24:06.699
Not with you hovering over me
like some bloody angel of death.

24:09.664 --> 24:12.565
I'll have to make
a larger blowup to read it.

24:16.604 --> 24:19.971
You still haven't told me what this
is about or where you got this photo.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.771
I didn't? No, you didn't.

24:22.844 --> 24:26.473
Of course, where you got it is quite
obvious to the experienced eye anyway.

24:26.547 --> 24:28.481
It is?

24:28.549 --> 24:30.540
Quite.

24:30.618 --> 24:32.813
You took this photo
probably from T.C.'s helicopter...

24:32.887 --> 24:34.821
at an altitude
of two or three thousand feet,

24:34.889 --> 24:39.223
using Robin Masters's 35- millimeter
reflex camera with a 600- millimeter lens.

24:39.294 --> 24:41.785
Higgins, you're amazing.

24:41.863 --> 24:45.731
Thank you.
The next question is, why?

24:45.800 --> 24:48.496
Why? Why you took it.
Although I don't really care.

24:48.569 --> 24:52.699
I just want to know. Is the name
of the ship important? Very.

24:52.774 --> 24:55.834
I thought so from the way
you've been hovering over me.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.943
Oh, come on, Higgins.

25:02.016 --> 25:05.417
I've already given up the wine cellar
and assorted other things.

25:05.486 --> 25:07.579
What more do you want?
Whatever I can get.

25:07.655 --> 25:10.123
Why do we have to play swap meet
every time I need something?

25:10.191 --> 25:13.354
Because I don't like the way you live.
I don't like the way you drive Robin's car.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.868
I don't like your friends.
You have been a thorn in my side...

25:15.930 --> 25:18.421
since the day Robin Masters invited you
to use his guesthouse.

25:18.499 --> 25:20.262
For as long as I wanted!

25:20.335 --> 25:23.202
That was a mistake he made
with which I have had to live.

25:23.271 --> 25:27.002
If the name of this ship is so important,
it's going to cost you dearly.

25:27.075 --> 25:29.009
Higgins, I need that name, now.

25:29.077 --> 25:30.806
I know.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.849
- Oh, boy. You are really something.
- Yes.

25:35.917 --> 25:38.477
All right, that's it. I give up.

25:38.553 --> 25:41.181
I am just tired of these games.
I'll tell you what, Higgins.

25:41.255 --> 25:43.553
- I'll give you it all.
- All?

25:43.624 --> 25:47.151
Yeah, I'll move out of the guesthouse and
off the estate. Now, I need that name now!

25:47.228 --> 25:49.856
Look, will Sunday be soon enough for you?

25:51.399 --> 25:54.493
Uh, Sunday? Uh, of course.
I... Good.!

25:54.569 --> 25:57.367
Now develop the photo
and give me that name.

25:59.941 --> 26:01.932
Now, please.

26:03.711 --> 26:05.645
Yes, of course.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.258
Her name was the Evelyn H,

26:17.342 --> 26:19.469
and I was waiting when she docked.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.375
According to the harbormaster,
she was registered in Panama,

26:24.449 --> 26:29.079
had a British crew, and sailed from Hong
Kong three weeks ago with a load of rice.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.089
Once Customs and
their dope-sniffing dog cleared her,

26:32.157 --> 26:34.182
the longshoremen
could start unloading.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.386
And that's when
I was gonna get aboard.

26:36.461 --> 26:38.759
According to Mac
and KH-14's photos,

26:38.830 --> 26:42.561
she was the only ship in the area
that T.C. could've refueled on that night.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.568
If T.C. wouldn't tell me why,

26:44.636 --> 26:47.104
maybe I could find
something on board that would.

26:47.172 --> 26:50.300
- Yeah?
- Thomas, T.C. did it. He pleaded guilty.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.172
Damn!

26:52.244 --> 26:54.439
The judge set sentencing for the 15th,
ordered his chopper...

26:54.513 --> 26:56.447
to be sold at public auction
on the same day.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.515
Now, you know the big lug
is gonna get the maximum.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.576
He wouldn't tell 'em
who he flew into the Islands.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.485
He just pleaded guilty and he clammed up.
I couldn't believe it.

27:03.555 --> 27:06.388
Can he make bail?
Yeah, I guess so.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.392
Now what do we do now?

27:08.460 --> 27:11.054
You keep an eye on him.
I'm gonna join the union.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.824
Join the union?

27:12.898 --> 27:16.265
Okay, we get to work
in a couple minutes, huh?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.633
Got a crate here.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.946
Come on, fellas.
We only got a couple more hours, huh?

27:29.014 --> 27:31.005
Let's get movin;

27:40.125 --> 27:43.219
No one seemed to notice anything wrong
with my being there.

27:43.295 --> 27:47.527
Or, maybe they figured an extra hand is an
extra hand no matter where it comes from.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.090
Either way, after a couple hours...

27:50.168 --> 27:54.696
I decided I didn't like this union
and would resign as soon as possible.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.938
Okay, let's break for lunch, huh?

28:39.251 --> 28:42.084
One advantage of having served
ten years in the navy...

28:42.153 --> 28:44.849
was that I knew my way around ships.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.930
It didn't take long to find
the passageway to the crew's quarters.

29:03.875 --> 29:08.676
Of course, warships and freighters
are built a little differently.

29:22.861 --> 29:27.195
Hey.! Hey, whatcha doin' here, mate?
Uh, lookin' for the head.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.098
Longshoremen gotta use
the one on the dock. You know that.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.864
No, this is my first day.
Well, them's the rules.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.429
Heads aboard ship
is strictly for crew.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.441
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.534
Now you do.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.341
Not that way. That way.

29:46.985 --> 29:48.976
Bloody apes.

30:13.111 --> 30:16.706
Bloody Customs inspectors are getting
more difficult each trip.

30:18.783 --> 30:20.774
Stay relaxed.

30:21.886 --> 30:24.980
There's plenty of time.
Work the lock.

30:25.056 --> 30:28.753
- Are you sure we should wait
until the sale? - Don't do that!

30:28.827 --> 30:30.920
We could try
and off-load at night, you know.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.930
Why take the unnecessary risk?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.489
It may cost us
an additional hundred thousand.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.501
But that's nothing
compared to ten million.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.663
In fact, I think
we should celebrate, mon ami.

30:40.739 --> 30:44.175
Come. I have a nice bottle
of Lafite Rothschild in my cabin.

30:44.242 --> 30:47.939
Well, I'd prefer scotch.
You English are still not civilized.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.972
Sometimes I get so lucky,
even I don't believe it.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.316
I didn't know what I was looking for,
but there had to be something on board...

31:00.392 --> 31:03.759
that would explain why
T.C. had picked someone up from the ship...

31:03.828 --> 31:06.422
and was acting the way he was.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.505
When I found it,
it was like a gun going off.

31:18.576 --> 31:22.569
The ship's log recorded that one of the
crew had died and was buried at sea.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.673
Nothing unusual in that.
It happens all the time.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.083
Except I knew this seaman.

31:29.154 --> 31:32.385
And suddenly,
everything T.C. did made sense.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.891
What the bloody hell!

31:34.959 --> 31:36.893
Oh! Hi, Captain.

31:36.961 --> 31:41.398
Hey, I know this looks kind of funny,
but, see, I think I can explain.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.730
Hold it!

31:43.802 --> 31:45.633
He was searching my cabin.!

32:18.703 --> 32:22.503
- Hey, guys!
- Lunch is over, boys.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.565
Thanks, guys!

32:55.740 --> 32:58.038
Why don't you guys go wash
the helicopter or somethin'?

32:59.077 --> 33:01.409
The feds got it, T.C.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.345
Then why don't you go wash
john's chopper?

33:20.565 --> 33:24.023
See, that's what's wrong around here.
Things are gettin' too soft.

33:24.102 --> 33:27.435
Ain't no challenges no more.
That's why I'm gettin' out of here.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.997
I'm... goin' to Alaska or somewhere.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.543
All right, so I'm lyin'.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.289
I did somethin' wrong.
I did somethin' illegal.

33:46.357 --> 33:49.588
You know, like clippin' 15 yards,
so I got penalized.

33:51.629 --> 33:55.326
What the hell am I doin' explainin' my life
to a bunch of snotty-nosed kids like you?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.360
All you do is hang around
and worry me to death...

33:57.402 --> 33:59.267
just 'cause I coached you
through a few games.

33:59.337 --> 34:03.364
Well, just get out!
Go on, get out!

34:03.441 --> 34:05.932
All of you, get out!

34:06.010 --> 34:09.411
You just know it wasn't for no money
or nothin' like that, man!

34:09.480 --> 34:12.813
It was for...

34:12.884 --> 34:14.976
You did it for a friend.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.648
Oh, man, how'd you find out?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.657
What's it matter? I found out.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.920
Yeah, well,
it ain't your problem.!

34:24.094 --> 34:26.120
Damn it, T.C.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.166
You think you're the only guy
who can help a buddy?

34:29.234 --> 34:33.431
Okay, Joey saved your life in 'Nam. Now you're
gonna give up everything you worked for?

34:33.504 --> 34:36.029
Everything you love?

34:36.107 --> 34:39.474
You could've at least told Rick or me.

34:39.543 --> 34:42.945
Yeah, well, that would've made you
both accessories.

34:43.014 --> 34:46.245
'Cause it's bad enough I got busted.
Wasn't no use of gettin' you involved.

34:46.317 --> 34:49.837
I mean, there wasn't nothin' you could do.
Joey needed to get home, and I had the ticket.

34:49.853 --> 34:53.949
- Where is he now? - I don't know.
Mainland, I guess. I don't know.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.927
Well, then tell the judge why you did it.
He'll take it into consideration.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.625
Thomas, man,
sometimes you can be so dumb!

35:01.699 --> 35:05.567
All right, I'll tell the judge.
I have to tell him who I smuggled in.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.765
Then they'd track him down.
I mean, even though it was eight years ago,

35:08.840 --> 35:11.138
he was a deserter, and the court
don't forget things like that.

35:11.209 --> 35:14.940
I mean, Joey had no business in 'Nam.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.709
I mean, we were all scared,
but this boy couldn't function at all.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.478
Well, he did once when
he pulled you out of that burning Cobra.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.452
T.C., what makes you think
you're the only guy...

35:23.521 --> 35:26.422
who knows what kind of guts
that took for a guy like Joey?

35:26.491 --> 35:29.392
What little he had, he just used up
in that one act, that's all.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.452
Yeah, to save me.
So if I gotta fly south to pay him back,

35:32.530 --> 35:34.464
that's exactly what I'm gonna do!

35:34.532 --> 35:38.798
Head south?
You're not jumpin' bail.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.498
Look, man, I appreciate
what you're tryin'to do.

35:41.572 --> 35:45.338
But I ain't goin' to jail.
In a lot of ways, me and Joey are alike.

35:45.410 --> 35:48.868
I don't think I can handle
bein' locked up for five years...

35:48.946 --> 35:52.143
no more than he could.
I'm not gonna let you do that, T.C.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.652
You're not gonna what?
There's gotta be a better way out of this.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.247
I checked all the angles, man,

35:59.324 --> 36:01.554
and there ain't no way.

36:01.626 --> 36:04.925
I appreciate what you're tryin' to do,
like I said,

36:04.996 --> 36:06.930
but it's time for T.C. to get out of here.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.934
You're not.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.993
Yes, I am...

36:13.071 --> 36:17.201
even if we gotta do an instant replay
of our first meetin' in Saigon.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.241
That's exactly what you gotta do.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.387
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

36:39.464 --> 36:42.456
Come on! Cut it out! Cut it out!

36:45.903 --> 36:47.894
Hey!

36:51.442 --> 36:53.376
Come on, you guys! Knock it off!

36:53.444 --> 36:55.435
T.C.!

37:12.296 --> 37:15.561
Island Hoppers.
No, it's Rick. Hold on.

37:15.633 --> 37:19.501
T.C., phone! Hold it!

37:19.570 --> 37:22.334
Hey, T.C...!

37:22.407 --> 37:24.398
Telephone.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.873
Yeah.

37:31.949 --> 37:34.349
Thanks.

37:44.729 --> 37:48.790
- T.C.
- T.C.?

37:48.866 --> 37:50.800
Joey?

37:50.868 --> 37:54.360
T.C.?

37:54.439 --> 37:58.603
I'm-I'm sorry.
Hey, boy, where are you?

37:58.676 --> 38:03.079
I-I... I tried to get clean.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.306
But...

38:08.419 --> 38:12.287
T.C., I... I lied.

38:14.091 --> 38:16.958
I...

38:17.028 --> 38:20.156
Hey, it's all right, man.

38:20.231 --> 38:23.223
Just tell me where you are.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.235
Joey?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.297
Joey?

38:31.776 --> 38:34.301
Joey!

38:38.331 --> 38:41.129
Rick traced the call through
one of his phone company connections...

38:41.201 --> 38:43.601
to an address on Hotel Street.

38:43.670 --> 38:47.333
We called for an ambulance, and since T.C.
had used his van to make bail,

38:47.407 --> 38:49.466
we piled into the Ferrari.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.772
At least it brought us
together again.

38:51.845 --> 38:55.144
Hey, look, would you please be still? Quit
squirming so much! All right, all right.

38:55.215 --> 38:58.878
God, I feel like a sardine.
I'm cramped in here so tight.

39:06.159 --> 39:08.423
Here it is. Here. Right here.

39:13.099 --> 39:16.068
Watch the door.
Anybody tried this before?

39:28.882 --> 39:31.350
Here he is.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.351
He's alive.

39:35.855 --> 39:38.847
Oh, man. Joey?

39:38.925 --> 39:42.759
Joey? Damn it,
he was clean just yesterday.

39:42.829 --> 39:45.696
Joey, it's T.C.

39:45.765 --> 39:49.997
joey, it's T.C.
I have to go... home.

39:50.069 --> 39:54.267
I've been running... too long.

39:54.340 --> 39:57.776
Home. Why did he do it?

39:57.844 --> 40:00.438
Damn it!
He was clean just yesterday.

40:07.554 --> 40:10.819
He couldn't have been.
He's been shootin' up all along, T.C.

40:10.890 --> 40:12.949
Uh-uh. No, no.
He wasn't strung out, man.

40:13.026 --> 40:15.620
I checked his eyes. They was normal.
Eyes.

40:15.695 --> 40:19.222
N-No. Fix.

40:19.299 --> 40:21.790
T.C. don't know.

40:21.868 --> 40:25.201
I'm... home.
I'll get the medics.

40:25.271 --> 40:29.264
Renard fixed... my eyes.

40:31.945 --> 40:35.506
Ma? Ma?

40:35.582 --> 40:39.746
Gotta go home! T.C.?

40:39.819 --> 40:42.754
Fixed my eyes.

40:42.822 --> 40:45.848
I can't... T.C.?

40:45.925 --> 40:49.292
Please.

40:49.362 --> 40:51.762
Clean. Renard...

40:52.899 --> 40:54.594
Hey, I...

40:54.667 --> 40:57.932
I can't pay Renard.

40:58.004 --> 41:00.199
I have to go home.

41:00.273 --> 41:02.673
T.C.?

41:02.742 --> 41:05.939
T.C...!

41:06.012 --> 41:08.537
Who's Renard?
How in the hell should I know?

41:08.615 --> 41:10.640
T.C.? Well, whoever he is, T.C.,

41:10.717 --> 41:13.517
he supplied Joey with drugs and
gave him eyedrops so you couldn't tell.

41:13.553 --> 41:15.987
Hell, there's a hundred grand
worth of heroin here, T.C.

41:16.055 --> 41:18.046
joey was never clean.

41:19.459 --> 41:22.451
I told him I wouldn't bring him in if he
wasn't clean. I told him that, Thomas!

41:22.528 --> 41:24.689
I told him unless he turned himself in,
if he wasn't clean...

41:24.764 --> 41:27.062
I wasn't gonna sneak him home!

41:28.468 --> 41:31.266
It's gonna be close. He
must've shot up a ton. Damn!

41:31.337 --> 41:33.271
It wasn't your fault, T.C.

41:33.339 --> 41:35.569
Yeah, well, that don't
make me feel no better.

41:38.978 --> 41:41.242
T.C., who's Renard?

41:41.314 --> 41:45.944
I don't know! Maybe it was that Frenchman that
brought him in on that freighter from Hong Kong.

41:46.019 --> 41:49.182
Why didn't the boy just fly to the
mainland? Why didn't he just go home?

41:49.255 --> 41:52.884
Because he was strung out, and he couldn't get
through airport security with all this dope.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.258
Holy cow.
Where did Joey get all this stuff?

41:56.329 --> 41:58.854
Probably from this Renard.
I mean, I doubt that Joey knew it,

41:58.932 --> 42:01.457
but the Frenchman wanted it
to look like T.C. was smuggling...

42:01.534 --> 42:04.025
joey and a bag full of heroin
into the Islands.

42:04.103 --> 42:07.436
He probably sent that S.O.S. to the
Coast Guard about the sinking yacht...

42:07.507 --> 42:09.532
right on your flight path.

42:09.609 --> 42:12.100
Oh, man,
you ain't makin' no sense.

42:12.178 --> 42:15.204
I mean, why bring Joey in
all the way from Hong Kong,

42:15.281 --> 42:18.148
stick him with a bag full of smack,
and then tip the Coast Guard?

42:18.217 --> 42:21.812
T.C., that was the only sure way
to have the Coast Guard catch you.

42:21.888 --> 42:24.618
- Me?
- And your chopper.

42:25.792 --> 42:29.853
That's a sale on item number one,
sold to the lady in the white hat.

42:29.929 --> 42:32.159
Now for item number two...
the helicopter.

42:32.231 --> 42:35.667
I have 81,000. That'll be 82.

42:35.735 --> 42:38.067
I can't swear to it,
but I think that was the chump...

42:38.137 --> 42:40.537
that led me to the bridge
when I went to pick up Joey.

42:40.606 --> 42:43.837
What if he gets outbid?
No one's going to outbid him.

42:43.910 --> 42:47.937
Man, I sure hate to see my bird
up on that choppin'block.

42:48.014 --> 42:52.815
Well, if what you guys tell me is right,
you'll have it back soon enough.

42:52.885 --> 42:56.286
You mind if we stick around,
just to be sure?

42:56.356 --> 42:58.324
You know I can't tell you guys
what to do.

42:58.391 --> 43:00.825
We're only backup on this.

43:00.893 --> 43:02.861
But it's a free country.

43:02.929 --> 43:06.456
If you happen to be in the area,
sure, you can watch.

43:06.532 --> 43:09.831
From a distance, of course.

43:09.902 --> 43:12.996
Of course.
Sold to the gentleman in the blue coat.

43:32.792 --> 43:34.726
That's good right there, fellas.

43:37.997 --> 43:40.192
Thank you.

44:02.622 --> 44:05.819
Well done, mon ami.
I rather enjoyed it.

44:07.527 --> 44:10.587
All right, guys. All right.
It's in under there.

44:10.663 --> 44:13.598
Okay? Go. And right there.

44:15.101 --> 44:19.629
Let's get it all out as quickly as we can.
Just keep it coming. Keep it...

44:19.705 --> 44:21.900
Ten million dollars worth of heroin,

44:21.974 --> 44:25.375
courtesy United States Coast Guard.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.379
Ahh.

44:27.447 --> 44:31.110
This is a federal officer.
The building is surrounded.

44:31.184 --> 44:33.084
Come out with your hands in the air.

44:41.194 --> 44:43.185
Halt!

44:50.403 --> 44:52.337
We can't make it!
We're gonna crash!

45:01.581 --> 45:05.278
Hi, Captain. Remember me?

45:07.053 --> 45:09.044
This is for Joey!

45:12.992 --> 45:15.984
That's for Joey! T.C.!

45:16.062 --> 45:18.496
Come on!

45:18.564 --> 45:21.624
Come on!

45:21.701 --> 45:25.159
Puttin' dope in kids' veins.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

45:25.238 --> 45:27.433
I'm all right.

45:28.808 --> 45:31.675
I'm all right.

45:31.744 --> 45:34.076
Get up! Get up!

45:34.147 --> 45:36.138
Get up!

45:49.195 --> 45:51.459
There must be a couple of million
dollars worth of heroin there.

45:51.531 --> 45:54.523
Yeah, they loaded it
when they refueled him.

45:54.600 --> 45:58.661
Thomas Magnum, do you know how close
you came to hittin' my bird?

45:58.738 --> 46:01.571
What? "" What"?

46:01.641 --> 46:05.042
Don't you "" what" me!
You are just careless! Plain careless!

46:05.111 --> 46:08.239
One day, you're gonna make me mad at you,
just really mad at you!

46:09.382 --> 46:11.407
Get off of there!

46:25.164 --> 46:27.098
What are you guys doin'
still standin' there?

46:27.166 --> 46:29.327
Come on. Get that stuff and move it.
Move it! Move it!

46:29.402 --> 46:33.702
We got practice in one hour.
Practice in one hour.

46:33.773 --> 46:36.674
What... Wait a minute. You can't hit me.
You can't hit me.

46:36.742 --> 46:39.006
Why not? Because that would be
assault, and assault's a felony.

46:39.078 --> 46:42.605
And that would violate your probation. You'd have
to do the five years the judge just suspended.

46:42.682 --> 46:45.446
Might be worth it.

46:48.988 --> 46:51.218
Are you about through?

46:51.290 --> 46:55.386
Yeah, yeah, man. Come on.
Let's get these last few boxes.

46:55.461 --> 46:57.929
You get the boxes.
I'll get this.

47:00.233 --> 47:02.394
Don't worry, Higgins.
We'll have Thomas out by sundown.

47:08.874 --> 47:10.432
Come on.

47:10.509 --> 47:13.967
Get out of the way,
you mangy pot hounds.

47:14.046 --> 47:17.038
Watch them, lads.

47:19.552 --> 47:22.885
Hey, guys, wait'll you see what I found
on the bottom of my closet.

47:30.963 --> 47:34.399
- Oh . Hi, Higgins.
- That is absolutely ridiculous.

47:34.467 --> 47:37.163
That's the whole point, Higgins.
Ah.

47:39.238 --> 47:42.605
I, uh, heard about T.C...

47:42.675 --> 47:45.337
what he did and why.

47:45.411 --> 47:47.606
Is, uh, his friend
going to be all right?

47:47.680 --> 47:51.138
Oh, I don't know, Higgins.
It kind of depends on Joey.

47:51.217 --> 47:54.653
I sure know he's better off with T.C.
than he was with those smugglers.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.779
Yes, quite.

47:57.923 --> 48:01.586
That's, uh, why you needed
the name of that ship, isn't it...

48:01.661 --> 48:04.027
to help T.C.?
Yeah. What difference does it make?

48:05.097 --> 48:07.031
None. Just curious.

48:07.099 --> 48:10.432
Well, look, Higgins,
I gotta finish packing here.

48:10.503 --> 48:13.995
- What about the inventory?
- Inventory?

48:14.073 --> 48:16.337
Surely you don't expect to leave
until I've taken an inventory...

48:16.409 --> 48:18.502
of all the furnishings,
paintings, linens?

48:18.577 --> 48:21.774
Come on, Higgins. Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not gonna steal any towels.

48:21.847 --> 48:26.250
This is Robin Masters's guesthouse and as head of
security on this estate it's my responsibility.

48:26.319 --> 48:28.844
I can't just let you walk out
without taking an inventory.

48:28.921 --> 48:32.982
So take it. I can't today.

48:33.059 --> 48:35.892
I have guests to look after.

48:35.961 --> 48:37.929
Perhaps tomorrow.
Oh, no, Higgins.

48:37.997 --> 48:40.124
You're not gonna do that.
You are not gonna hold...

48:40.199 --> 48:43.327
this inventory over me
like the sword of Damocles.

48:43.402 --> 48:46.633
Now, if you don't do it today, that's it.
The deal's off. I'm staying.

48:47.873 --> 48:51.741
Well, then, I'm afraid...

48:51.811 --> 48:53.745
you'll just have to stay.

49:01.287 --> 49:03.414
Well, I'll be damned.
