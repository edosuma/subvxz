01:03.110 --> 01:04.519
Rolling.

01:04.554 --> 01:07.564
Jorinda Garber,
reading for the part of Jessie.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.128
Jessie, I'm in love with you.

01:10.163 --> 01:13.576
Vipers don't love, Karina.
They poison.

01:13.611 --> 01:16.911
I still feel your venom cursing
through my veins.

01:16.946 --> 01:20.407
You used me as a pon
in your twisted relationship.

01:20.442 --> 01:23.520
How many girls
have you and Frances destroyed

01:23.555 --> 01:27.423
to tell your... sordid stories to each other
as a foul play?

01:27.458 --> 01:29.480
- You don't understand.
- I understand.

01:29.512 --> 01:32.096
I understand enough to know
that I despise you.

01:32.121 --> 01:34.483
You're the only that
I've ever felt this way about.

01:34.530 --> 01:36.856
Liar! Fucking liar!

01:39.139 --> 01:41.672
Liar! You're a fucking liar!

01:41.735 --> 01:44.930
No, Karina, I absolutely...
I hate you so much, Karina.

01:44.968 --> 01:47.373
I absolutely hate you. I really...

01:48.017 --> 01:49.692
I can't! I...

01:49.735 --> 01:51.680
Really, I love you.

01:52.397 --> 01:54.713
I love you, I love you.

02:01.926 --> 02:03.301
Cut!

02:04.597 --> 02:06.243
This was great, Niki.

02:06.285 --> 02:08.993
How many girls have you and Frances fucked

02:09.097 --> 02:12.373
in order to tell sordid stories to each other,
part of some fucking foul play!

02:13.127 --> 02:15.431
You're really fucked up,
you know that?

02:16.056 --> 02:17.872
That was awesome!

02:17.917 --> 02:21.331
That was totally amazing.
I loved it.

03:24.497 --> 03:26.472
- Good job!
- Alright, Kit.

03:26.535 --> 03:28.121
Switch up for a second.
I want to show you.

03:28.145 --> 03:30.533
When you drop down on your two legs,
Use your fallforce.

03:30.575 --> 03:34.481
- I don't wanna go to SheBar.
- Why?

03:34.517 --> 03:35.952
'Cause I'm not interested in

03:35.995 --> 03:39.242
L.A.'s first super-hot, girls-only club,

03:39.287 --> 03:41.541
- straight out of Miami.
- It'll be fun.

03:41.586 --> 03:44.250
- No, it's gonna be boring.
- I heard they sank a lot of money into it.

03:44.286 --> 03:45.730
Are you gonna go, Shane?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.951
- I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
- Oh, come on!

03:48.035 --> 03:49.880
When's the last time
you missed a club opening?

03:49.927 --> 03:52.803
- It's gonna be torture for her.
- I never said that.

03:53.155 --> 03:55.273
I just said I haven't decided yet,

03:55.808 --> 03:58.263
- and that's all.
- How could you not be going, Alice?

03:58.307 --> 04:00.413
Oh, 'cause Tasha can't be out
at a lezzy bar,

04:00.445 --> 04:03.332
and I got invited to a Barry Bird party,
with a guest.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.612
The entertainment lawyer?

04:05.658 --> 04:07.252
You know, he's famous for those velvet,

04:07.267 --> 04:11.692
like mafia underground type parties
for all the closet in Hollywood homos.

04:11.735 --> 04:13.661
And it's fascinating, because,
before you go to a party,

04:13.737 --> 04:16.600
you have to sign an anonymous closure form.
It's crazy.

04:19.838 --> 04:21.651
- Alright.
- Nice work!

04:21.688 --> 04:23.970
Everyone gets a partner
and some pads.

04:24.016 --> 04:26.701
We're gonna learn how to face each other
and go over some punching technics.

04:27.296 --> 04:28.783
Why don't you wanna go?

04:28.827 --> 04:32.901
I've never been to one
of the L.A. lesbian clubs before

04:32.946 --> 04:35.101
except for the Planet on thursday nights.

04:35.157 --> 04:37.790
That's my point. I just,
I don't wanna go to a bar that's,

04:37.835 --> 04:40.240
you know, in direct competition
with my sister.

04:40.285 --> 04:43.710
But it's not a competition. I mean,
there's enough room for everybody

04:43.748 --> 04:47.530
and besides, it's so important
to support women's businesses.

04:47.578 --> 04:51.650
It's just like it's so important that
you guys are here supporting me today!

04:51.698 --> 04:53.261
We're here because we love you.

04:53.347 --> 04:55.491
And because we were so freaked out
about the robbery.

04:55.578 --> 04:58.591
Alright everyone. Okay,
right foot back, left foot forward.

04:58.606 --> 05:01.612
Left hands up, okay?
Protect your face.

05:01.658 --> 05:04.730
When you are ready,
you're gonna scream and defend, "No!".

05:04.768 --> 05:06.722
- You're okay? You're okay?
- Yeah.

05:08.446 --> 05:10.123
Here we go!

05:14.798 --> 05:16.630
Who owns the SheBar anyway, you guys?

05:16.675 --> 05:19.030
It's those girls from Miami, you know,
they're a couple.

05:19.055 --> 05:22.182
Dawn Denbo, Cindy something-or-other.
They're, like, infamous party girls.

05:22.218 --> 05:25.332
Hey, Shane. Don't you think
she's hot? The trainer?

05:26.126 --> 05:29.031
She's got the abs,
she's got the ass...

05:29.066 --> 05:30.730
No, I don't.

05:33.415 --> 05:35.830
- "No", right, no?
- Okay!

05:37.306 --> 05:40.142
So, I think that the bar,
it's gonna be crazy,

05:40.175 --> 05:42.020
'cause all the lesbians in Hollywood

05:42.058 --> 05:43.590
wanna be in the movie.

05:43.637 --> 05:45.273
I won't worry about it
too much, Jenny.

05:45.317 --> 05:46.510
Fuck off!

05:47.016 --> 05:49.543
My agents are like,
you should wear a tee-shirt

05:49.586 --> 05:52.880
that says: "Sorry,
Nathalie Portman has the job".

05:52.925 --> 05:55.040
Natalie passed.
We're going with Niki Stevens.

05:56.266 --> 05:57.842
No, you're not!

05:59.426 --> 06:01.972
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It happened late last night.

06:02.665 --> 06:06.602
Let's switch up, switch up, okay?
Other persons have the pads.

06:06.897 --> 06:09.533
Tina, are you gonna go to SheBar?

06:09.575 --> 06:11.152
Yeah, I think so.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.280
I thought you're gonna meet
Brenda there?

06:13.367 --> 06:14.383
Who's Brenda?

06:15.515 --> 06:17.920
Just this girl I went out with
last week.

06:18.535 --> 06:22.042
She's a heart surgeon, she's hot,
talks dirty in bed.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.020
Dirty talking? Nice.
You slept with her on the first date?

06:27.396 --> 06:29.121
Yeah, I did, actually.

06:30.007 --> 06:31.791
Now you're gonna go to SheBar with her?

06:31.838 --> 06:33.621
I don't know; she's going anyway.

06:33.656 --> 06:35.192
I just thought I'd meet her there,

06:35.238 --> 06:36.703
since we're both going.

06:37.206 --> 06:39.210
She's hot. I like her.

06:40.195 --> 06:43.823
- What the fuck, Bette?!
- I'm sorry. I'm just playing.

06:43.857 --> 06:46.020
Alright everyone, let's stop
with the pads training.

06:47.748 --> 06:49.622
- Shane?
- Yeah?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.651
Can I use you for a second?

06:51.688 --> 06:52.642
Yeah.

06:53.536 --> 06:55.151
Teacher's going.

06:55.558 --> 06:57.113
Someone's in trouble.

06:57.176 --> 07:00.212
Pads over. Alright.
Just wanna use you for a demo over here.

07:00.257 --> 07:03.630
Come on, over. Behind me.
Tight and closed.

07:04.426 --> 07:05.852
All the way in, all the way in.

07:07.387 --> 07:10.683
I don't know, I think we should
sign Angelica up for self-defence class.

07:11.615 --> 07:14.450
Let's just wait til she gets out of
the stroller first.

07:15.816 --> 07:19.332
Grab the wrist, twist over,
punching into the nose,

07:19.377 --> 07:20.800
- knee into the groin.
- Summer,

07:20.845 --> 07:22.442
what if this motherfucker has a gun?

07:22.485 --> 07:24.421
If they have a gun, you do what they say.
Okay?

07:24.467 --> 07:26.792
But if you have a chance to run,
you do it.

07:26.836 --> 07:28.603
Run to safety.

07:28.647 --> 07:30.331
Let's partners up and try this, okay?

07:30.377 --> 07:31.833
You've gotta learn these skills.

07:31.866 --> 07:35.433
Okay. One person behind,
the other person's gonna come here front.

07:35.465 --> 07:39.652
You're holding her nice and tight.
Okay? Grip, grip. Nice and tight, okay?

07:40.538 --> 07:42.433
Behind, nice and tight. Grip her.

07:42.477 --> 07:44.861
You're the attacker. I'm sure
you can hold tighter than that.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.882
Ok, persons in front,
what they're gonna do

07:46.925 --> 07:49.143
- is...
- I think Summer likes you.

07:49.185 --> 07:51.480
Would you please shut the fucking up?

07:51.516 --> 07:54.001
- God, frickin' mouth.
- Has anyone seen Shane's vagina?

07:54.087 --> 07:58.411
- 'Cause I think she dropped it somewhere.
- Okay, one, two, three, scream "No!".

08:01.747 --> 08:03.721
You have 17 messages already.

08:03.736 --> 08:07.582
Oh, that's nothing. I mean, Alice gets, like,
50 in the first hour that she posts.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.221
What are they saying?

08:10.106 --> 08:11.091
What?

08:11.986 --> 08:14.461
Nothing. Just some ignorant jerk.

08:15.087 --> 08:16.343
Read it to me.

08:20.038 --> 08:23.272
"This is a lesbian space.
I don't really need to know

08:23.306 --> 08:26.833
that Max Sweeney thinks
of his large click as a big dick

08:26.866 --> 08:29.752
and his freaked girlfriend
likes to squeeze his tits

08:29.788 --> 08:32.280
and that's why
he didn't get top surgery".

08:36.546 --> 08:38.822
I guess that's why we post in here, right?

08:38.856 --> 08:41.001
To educate people like that, right?

08:42.027 --> 08:43.341
Whatever.

08:47.786 --> 08:50.800
- Hey, Alice.
- Max, you invaded my space

08:50.836 --> 08:53.522
to put out your own agenda,
and it wasn't cool at all.

08:53.555 --> 08:56.992
But, here's what I'll do.
You can blog once a week,

08:57.025 --> 08:59.010
I'll put you in your own little box
with the homepage,

08:59.057 --> 09:01.390
- with the guestbians.
- Why not with the guestbians?

09:01.422 --> 09:03.196
Because it's a lesbian site, Max.

09:03.231 --> 09:05.723
And I just don't want to get bombarded
with a bunch of dykes, you know,

09:05.750 --> 09:07.696
flipping out about this transgender thing.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.922
You can't segregate trans people
out of the lesbian community. I mean...

09:10.965 --> 09:13.022
No, I'm not saying that, you know,

09:13.066 --> 09:16.702
lesbians and transgenders can't share
the same space. I'm just saying...

09:16.776 --> 09:20.422
Good afternoon, m'am.
We're looking for an Alice Pieszecki.

09:21.506 --> 09:25.140
I gotta go.
I'm Alice Pieszecki.

09:25.187 --> 09:27.771
I'm Major Dorell,
this is Lieutenant Finarti.

09:27.816 --> 09:29.923
We'd like to talk to you
for a few minutes.

09:29.957 --> 09:33.282
Did something happen to Tasha?

09:33.335 --> 09:35.912
- You're a friend of Captain Williams?
- Yeah.

09:35.947 --> 09:38.470
Could we talk inside for a minute?

09:38.517 --> 09:40.171
It'll just take a few minutes.

09:41.076 --> 09:43.221
Yeah. Sure.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.902
Why are you here?
What's this about?

09:48.945 --> 09:52.382
<b>We just want to ask you a few questions,
M'am. It's not...</b>

09:53.028 --> 09:55.602
What's your relationship
with Captain Williams?

09:56.216 --> 09:58.911
We're friends.
You didn't answer my question.

10:02.676 --> 10:04.860
What's "Velvetpark"?

10:04.898 --> 10:07.152
It's a magazine.

10:08.067 --> 10:10.151
Did you wanna answer my question?

10:10.196 --> 10:12.502
"Dyke culture in bloom"?

10:12.538 --> 10:14.422
"Gay L.A.".

10:19.567 --> 10:21.281
SheBar,

10:21.315 --> 10:22.851
you're going, Fin?

10:22.896 --> 10:24.382
Uh, no.

10:25.065 --> 10:26.881
- I assume you...
- You know what?

10:26.885 --> 10:28.292
You don't have a search warrant, so

10:28.386 --> 10:31.482
- I'd like you to leave.
- Oh, don't worry, Miss Pieszecki.

10:31.525 --> 10:34.431
I can call you "Miss", right?
You're not married or anything.

10:36.618 --> 10:37.732
So...

10:38.735 --> 10:40.361
what is this?

10:41.546 --> 10:43.812
Nothing. Just...

10:44.556 --> 10:46.642
Wait a minute. I know what it is.

10:46.666 --> 10:50.301
It's like of a low tech version of
what you have on your lesbian website.

10:50.335 --> 10:53.501
- Is Captain Williams on it?
- No.

10:56.785 --> 10:59.642
Who is "T"? Someone
who didn't want her name on it?

10:59.677 --> 11:02.572
You should go. Now.
I think you should go.

11:05.517 --> 11:07.033
Come on, Darell.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.803
Well, thanks for your time, M'am.

11:08.896 --> 11:11.122
I hope we didn't disturb you too much.

11:22.438 --> 11:23.972
Oh, fuck!

11:25.706 --> 11:27.321
Fuck!

11:27.597 --> 11:31.062
And then he put the gun on his head
and he pulled the trigger.

11:31.717 --> 11:34.543
- He had a gun?
- Turned out to be soap stone.

11:34.578 --> 11:37.840
He cut it himself. But
it looked totally 100% real.

11:37.856 --> 11:41.280
It sounds like a very disturbing
piece of art.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.231
It wasn't art, Dean Porter.

11:43.325 --> 11:45.213
Everyone in the room
was traumatized by it.

11:45.255 --> 11:47.792
You know, sometimes, some people
are pretty upset about your work.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.501
Sometimes that's what art seeks to do.

11:49.536 --> 11:52.340
Standing in front of a class
and threatening to blow your brain out

11:52.378 --> 11:55.682
isn't what art seeks to do.
It was self-inflicted terrorrism.

11:58.888 --> 12:00.912
I'm gonna look into it.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.430
Don't blow me off, Dean Porter.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.212
I'm not blowing you off, Lani.

12:10.218 --> 12:12.900
I'm just gonna gather some more information.
Then talk to Justin,

12:12.908 --> 12:14.370
and Professor Lerner.

12:14.378 --> 12:17.762
Now, I understand how upset you are,
but I also know

12:17.765 --> 12:20.553
that, if it had been your project
that has caused such controversy,

12:20.556 --> 12:22.312
you would have wanted to fair hearing.

12:25.058 --> 12:26.763
Are you gonna be okay?

12:28.047 --> 12:29.290
I don't know.

12:30.885 --> 12:32.402
I think you are.

12:33.088 --> 12:35.670
And I'm here
if you want to talk to anyone.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.062
Jesus!

12:40.746 --> 12:43.721
Vipers don't love, Karina.
They poison.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.760
I mean, I still feel your venom
cursing through my veins.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.712
- I like her.
- Yeah, she's natural.

12:51.808 --> 12:52.641
It's good.

12:55.068 --> 12:58.652
There is no way that I'm casting
Niki Stevens. She can't act.

12:58.675 --> 13:01.251
Jenny, she's the best actor for the role.

13:01.308 --> 13:03.510
She has star quality, look at her!

13:03.526 --> 13:06.582
She looks like she just walked out
of Maxim magazine.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.363
- I'm sorry. Is that a bad thing?
- Aaron,

13:08.458 --> 13:10.512
- it doesn't look like she's a writer.
- I mean, you're beautiful,

13:10.527 --> 13:13.141
you're a writer. Why can't she play
a beautiful writer?

13:13.187 --> 13:15.653
'Cause it looks like the last book
she read was ten years ago.

13:15.748 --> 13:18.090
- Are you there? God, it's me Margaret!
- Okay, so

13:18.137 --> 13:20.190
- what's your choice?
- Luchi Santis is my choice.

13:20.235 --> 13:22.013
- That girl is too weird.
- She's the best actor.

13:22.045 --> 13:24.021
- She's too intense. She's not attractive.
- That's the character.

13:24.065 --> 13:26.993
- Have you read the script, Aaron?
- She's not fuckable!

13:27.566 --> 13:31.891
Look, Niki has hit behind her.
She's got a huge movie coming.

13:31.926 --> 13:34.090
- So, fucking what?!
- So we need hit!

13:34.095 --> 13:36.060
To put asses in the seats!

13:36.106 --> 13:39.453
Do you have any idea what kind of a risk
I'm taking on this film?

13:40.868 --> 13:44.172
Look, look at her. I mean,
she completely sold the kiss.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.570
That's really important having an actor
that looks like

13:46.636 --> 13:48.520
she enjoys kissing other women.

13:48.555 --> 13:51.171
I don't care about that.
Adele, stop writing.

13:51.218 --> 13:53.812
- Get me William on the phone.
- William is in Geneva.

13:53.858 --> 13:56.920
I spoke with William this morning,
and he's over the moon with Nikki.

13:56.965 --> 13:59.081
- He saw Niki as the star of our new film.
- He liked her.

13:59.128 --> 14:01.890
And he said he'd rather have her
than Nathalie Portman, okay?

14:01.936 --> 14:03.950
- So, are we finished?
- No, we're not finished.

14:03.997 --> 14:07.571
You got the fuckin' DGA card.
Why don't you direct the whole movie?

14:07.615 --> 14:10.561
Yeah, I'll direct the movie.
Why don't you fuckin' pay for the movie?

14:10.597 --> 14:13.003
Go fuck yourself.
And you know what?

14:13.047 --> 14:15.021
You've a small dick.

14:15.035 --> 14:18.513
We'll make this movie with Nikki Stevens
or we won't make that movie!

14:18.547 --> 14:20.742
How does she know how big my dick is?

14:21.066 --> 14:22.793
I think she'll come around.

14:23.448 --> 14:24.972
Excuse me?

14:25.008 --> 14:28.592
Well, you know, she's quitting smocking
and so she's just really fragile right now. But

14:28.636 --> 14:30.492
I think it'll be just
let her get through her process.

14:30.525 --> 14:32.983
- Who are you? Who is she?
- It's Jenny's assistant.

14:33.007 --> 14:35.130
Look, I'm gonna call
Nikki Stevens' agent, all right?

14:35.177 --> 14:37.451
I'm gonna call her today and
have a great relationship with her.

14:37.498 --> 14:40.341
- I'm gonna get going right now.
- Tina, get Schecter on board.

14:40.386 --> 14:42.410
I don't wanna a cranky director.

14:42.456 --> 14:45.382
I want her to love Niki Stevens
like it was her own idea.

14:45.425 --> 14:47.201
- Capice?
- Capice.

14:55.287 --> 14:57.971
I need these slides by wednesday. No.

14:58.006 --> 14:59.820
No, the meeting is on friday.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.401
I need a day to go over.

15:02.757 --> 15:04.781
You wanted to see me, Dean Porter?

15:05.895 --> 15:07.511
Yeah, I need it by friday.

15:07.548 --> 15:11.360
If it doesn't come by friday,
then it's of no service to me or to anyone.

15:12.506 --> 15:13.853
That's right.

15:13.897 --> 15:16.750
Okay, great.
No, that's a good idea.

15:17.275 --> 15:20.090
Alright, thanks.
Wednesday, wednesday. Bye.

15:22.527 --> 15:25.020
How could you let a student

15:25.057 --> 15:28.471
stand in front of your class
with a gun pointed to his head?

15:30.065 --> 15:33.412
It wasn't a real gun.
Who told you it was a real gun?

15:33.446 --> 15:35.912
I know that it was carved out
of soap stone, but,

15:36.408 --> 15:38.712
apparently it looked very realistic

15:38.755 --> 15:40.472
and now, Lani Shipman

15:40.508 --> 15:42.431
has been traumatized by it.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.072
- Do you want something else?
- No.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.601
I want you to tell me about this

15:51.637 --> 15:53.642
idiot who made the gun sculpture.

15:54.697 --> 15:56.442
He's talented.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.161
You're not gonna suspend him for this?

15:59.197 --> 16:02.210
No, of course not.
Come on.

16:02.256 --> 16:05.160
You know my position on the freedom
of expression, but in this climate...

16:05.208 --> 16:06.712
What climate is that?

16:08.738 --> 16:10.950
- What climate is that?
- Yeah.

16:13.047 --> 16:15.053
Columbine,

16:15.098 --> 16:17.072
Virginia Tech.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.763
Is there something
you want me to do?

16:34.898 --> 16:39.123
I want you to be just a little bit more
thoughtful sometimes.

16:40.018 --> 16:43.501
I think about my students all the time.

16:44.285 --> 16:48.182
I think about how to support them,

16:48.748 --> 16:51.390
and how to change them,

16:52.218 --> 16:54.631
and I think about how, um,

16:54.668 --> 16:57.263
help them grow as artists.

16:57.306 --> 16:59.552
So, what are we talking about?

17:05.517 --> 17:10.483
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I know, I know, I know.

17:16.265 --> 17:18.211
I'm not saying that

17:18.766 --> 17:21.041
you did anything wrong.

17:21.076 --> 17:22.652
Thank you.

17:25.086 --> 17:28.590
Look, I'm gonna go then.
I'm hungry.

17:29.158 --> 17:31.091
Am I dismissed?

17:31.126 --> 17:33.282
I want you to kiss me good night.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.522
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

18:17.535 --> 18:20.531
I think I'm gonna be working late tonight.

18:22.087 --> 18:23.692
Maybe tomorrow?

18:26.616 --> 18:28.082
If you're lucky.

18:42.016 --> 18:44.302
Are you alone?
Did anyone follow you?

18:44.338 --> 18:45.961
- What?
- Oh god!

18:45.978 --> 18:47.980
What are you talking about?
Are you okay?

18:48.017 --> 18:49.681
No, I'm not okay.

18:49.727 --> 18:51.311
What the fuck are you doing?

18:51.347 --> 18:52.941
I'm degayinfying.

18:52.985 --> 18:55.143
Oh god! They got in to get pictures

18:55.208 --> 18:56.700
and they didn't even have a warrant.

18:56.737 --> 18:59.302
Maybe they'll come here again.
There'll be no evidence of gay.

18:59.336 --> 19:00.283
You know what?

19:00.798 --> 19:02.982
You should keep this somewhere safe.

19:03.627 --> 19:06.481
Wait! When and who
ever comes here again?

19:06.516 --> 19:09.090
These two military men!
Two!

19:09.125 --> 19:10.993
Shit!

19:11.026 --> 19:13.752
You know, they were fucking nutsy.
They scared me.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.361
- What did they want?
- They came in, okay?

19:16.385 --> 19:18.723
They're just walking around,
looking at things!

19:18.766 --> 19:20.642
They tried to get me out of you.

19:20.717 --> 19:22.543
Which I didn't, I swear.

19:22.586 --> 19:24.912
I just said, you know, leave
they should leave.

19:25.598 --> 19:29.202
- Shit, I'm so sorry.
- I know. What was I supposed to do?

19:29.248 --> 19:30.540
Oh, I'm so sorry this happened to you.

19:33.228 --> 19:36.550
I didn't tell those fuckers a thing
they could use against you, okay?

19:36.585 --> 19:38.061
Not a thing.

19:39.347 --> 19:40.780
Hey, you've heard from Helena?

19:40.887 --> 19:42.872
Well, she told me to tell everyone

19:43.347 --> 19:44.683
not to worry about her.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.101
Well, she must have
a hidden treasure somewhere.

19:47.106 --> 19:49.110
Nah, I don't think so.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.413
Maybe she's with Dusty, I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.

19:51.447 --> 19:53.783
- I just hope she'll be safe.
- She's gonna be fine.

19:53.835 --> 19:55.253
Are you sure this is gonna
keep me awake?

19:55.326 --> 19:57.052
Yeah, it's chocolate. It is good for you.

19:57.085 --> 19:59.880
<b>You've got this big appetite... these days.</b>

19:59.977 --> 20:01.911
I know. I'm trying
to trade food for sex.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.240
Amen to that!

20:04.806 --> 20:08.362
- So, what are you playing?
- I'm playing Lara Croft: Legend.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.941
- Oh, she's a hottie.
- That is not why

20:10.977 --> 20:12.463
I'm playing this game, Kit.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.053
- I'm not!
- Look how fast your thumbs are going.

20:17.098 --> 20:19.790
I don't know actually
how I'm doing this at all.

20:21.905 --> 20:24.050
- "Danger" by Betty Everett -

20:30.835 --> 20:32.400
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

20:34.045 --> 20:36.352
Earth to Shane.

20:36.825 --> 20:38.233
What?

20:38.636 --> 20:40.722
- What?
- Are you okay?

20:46.097 --> 20:48.763
I'm fine, I'm good. Can I...

20:48.806 --> 20:50.842
Can I get that to go?

20:59.215 --> 21:01.161
Why the fuck didn't you tell me that

21:01.208 --> 21:03.132
they were gonna send their dogs
on my friend's house?

21:03.166 --> 21:04.711
Keep your voice down,
and tell me what happened.

21:04.718 --> 21:07.243
You're supposed to be my lawyer!
You're supposed to be on top of this!

21:07.276 --> 21:09.452
You are crossing a line right now,
you realize it?

21:09.498 --> 21:11.462
I realize you don't give a damn about me

21:11.487 --> 21:13.073
but you had an obligation

21:13.118 --> 21:15.043
to tell me that my friend's privacy

21:15.108 --> 21:16.763
and her home would be invaded!

21:16.805 --> 21:19.303
- It's not the matter. They don't always.
- Yeah, but you knew that they might

21:19.337 --> 21:21.871
- and you didn't tell me!
- Who'd they talk to?

21:21.915 --> 21:23.151
Alice!

21:23.187 --> 21:26.902
They went to her appartment
and they interrogated her.

21:26.947 --> 21:28.802
She's an innocent civilian, Beech.

21:28.846 --> 21:32.631
Well, she's part of their case
because of your alleged relationship with her.

21:33.447 --> 21:35.133
Are you on their side?

21:35.178 --> 21:39.110
- I'm representing you in this.
- Are you on their fucking side?!

21:39.148 --> 21:41.480
Are you just gonna stand back and let them

21:41.525 --> 21:45.003
rip apart my fucking career
and destroy my fucking life?!

21:45.036 --> 21:47.373
- Curtis, what's going on?
- It's okay.

21:47.417 --> 21:50.513
- Henry is sleeping.
- Go to bed. It's okay.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.990
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.411
I'm sorry to

21:54.456 --> 21:57.552
bust into your house
like this without any warning.

21:57.588 --> 22:00.952
You're not any part of this;
you're not even in the service.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.712
And it was wrong of me to

22:03.758 --> 22:05.290
disrupt your home and your family,

22:05.377 --> 22:07.680
and to probably frighten and confuse you.

22:09.558 --> 22:11.760
I hope I didn't wake your son.

22:11.817 --> 22:13.293
Please forgive me.

22:20.468 --> 22:22.242
Please, go with me.

22:22.286 --> 22:23.763
Please...

22:23.765 --> 22:25.511
<b>It's not worth... for me.</b>

22:25.557 --> 22:28.190
Why don't you just go
to the party on your own?

22:28.708 --> 22:31.440
The whole point of going to the party
is going with you.

22:31.455 --> 22:33.053
It's the whole point!

22:33.525 --> 22:36.952
It's gonna be Hollywood under cover.
There'll be really tight security,

22:36.996 --> 22:39.933
and there'll be like top-secret and

22:39.966 --> 22:42.302
you know? And we get
to be out together,

22:42.317 --> 22:44.763
like out of the house, really together.

22:46.055 --> 22:47.873
Please...

22:47.917 --> 22:50.711
- Please do it for me.
- It makes me uncomfortable.

22:50.758 --> 22:53.620
Oh god! I'm so bored with you in this...
No!

22:53.658 --> 22:55.350
Away!

22:55.387 --> 22:57.963
Fine! We'll stay in our room
in private, but...

22:58.005 --> 23:00.071
Oh come on! No, seriously, Alice,

23:00.166 --> 23:01.951
you've been talking about
this party all week.

23:01.996 --> 23:04.751
- Yes, I have!
- I don't want you to stop living your life.

23:04.795 --> 23:05.980
Just go.

23:06.028 --> 23:08.980
Hello, Tasha! Living my life would
be living it with you.

23:09.027 --> 23:10.773
Have you ever heard that?

23:11.877 --> 23:15.460
Come on, what's the point of going to
a secret love party without my secret love?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.691
Please, please...

23:18.225 --> 23:19.761
Say yes.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.120
Are you positive that it's safe?

23:22.167 --> 23:25.663
- Yes. It's famous clositive people.
- Yeah?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.673
I think it'll be fine.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.620
You've got nothing on them.

23:32.218 --> 23:33.962
- Careful.
- Come on.

23:34.478 --> 23:36.530
I feel like you wanna go.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.531
Say yes.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.210
Is it me? Is it 'cause I'm too

23:43.246 --> 23:45.322
- loud and...
- No, no, no.

23:45.367 --> 23:48.103
There's nothing wrong with who you are.

23:48.108 --> 23:51.642
I definitely don't want you to feel like
because you're with me,

23:51.677 --> 23:53.650
that your life is on trial.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.960
Yeah, it's just
really important to me that...

23:57.438 --> 23:59.620
- What?
- Let's just say...

24:01.048 --> 24:03.162
Wait, wait, wait here.

24:12.527 --> 24:13.963
Who is it?

24:13.995 --> 24:15.963
I'm looking for Tasha Williams.

24:16.425 --> 24:18.033
She's not here.

24:18.066 --> 24:20.552
My name's Captain Curtis Beech,
I'm her attorney.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.313
- It's fine.
- Well she's...

24:27.837 --> 24:29.491
What do you want?

24:30.228 --> 24:31.982
You must be Alice Piezecki.

24:34.026 --> 24:36.020
Yeah, that's who she is.

24:36.738 --> 24:39.130
<b>It's almost to show...
why you should be retained</b>

24:39.167 --> 24:41.703
which means we're gonna have
to collect testimonies and

24:41.705 --> 24:46.053
recommendations. You really think
your CO's supporting this?

24:46.095 --> 24:49.102
Major Dixon likes me. I know he didn't want
to pursue that allegation.

24:49.138 --> 24:51.063
Thank you very much. Thank you.

24:54.378 --> 24:56.643
So, do you think
we stand a chance?

24:57.608 --> 24:58.931
I don't know.

24:59.515 --> 25:01.153
We're gonna do our best.

25:01.198 --> 25:04.152
Going amount defense,
we're not going to step back.

25:04.198 --> 25:07.460
Well, Tasha's the best soldier
that I know, Sir.

25:08.097 --> 25:10.651
I'm the only soldier that she knows.

25:11.318 --> 25:12.842
You don't have to call me Sir, Alice.

25:12.885 --> 25:14.303
Oh, I kinda like it.

25:15.538 --> 25:18.511
Sir, will you thank your wife for me?

25:18.558 --> 25:19.672
Oh, why?

25:19.715 --> 25:22.733
Well, Tasha told me
what happened last night, and

25:23.915 --> 25:26.741
I have this theory that behind
any man who does the right thing,

25:26.808 --> 25:29.461
there is always a woman
who got him to that point.

25:30.378 --> 25:33.532
Well, my wife was disgusted
when I told her what happened

25:33.565 --> 25:35.970
- you girls yesterday.
- Us girls.

25:37.747 --> 25:40.430
Okay, I'm gonna get some sugar.
I forgot the sugar.

25:43.268 --> 25:45.600
I guess I should have said
"Women, huh".

25:45.647 --> 25:46.790
Yeah.

25:47.418 --> 25:49.081
She's quite some.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.433
Yeah.

25:51.505 --> 25:53.193
See your catch, Williams.

25:53.236 --> 25:54.873
Smart, pretty and funny.

25:57.418 --> 26:00.022
- Okay, look. This?
- I hate it.

26:00.056 --> 26:01.500
Adele!!

26:01.535 --> 26:04.131
- Where is she? She's never here when...
- That I love.

26:04.177 --> 26:06.081
- Why?
- Because it's see-through.

26:06.185 --> 26:07.833
- No wonderbra.
- No.

26:10.418 --> 26:13.193
- Maybe.
- Adele, I need your opinion.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.071
- Yes?
- What do you think of the dress?

26:15.106 --> 26:17.463
- Um... it's gorgeous. It's great.
- I don't like that.

26:17.527 --> 26:19.830
- Where is William?
- He's in Geneva.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.003
I don't care if he's in Geneva.
Can you get him on the phone?

26:22.086 --> 26:24.252
Okay, absolutely. You know what?
I have actually called him.

26:24.297 --> 26:26.221
- How many times have you called him?
- I called him four times

26:26.258 --> 26:28.582
- and I will absolutely, I'm gonna... I'll call.
- Call him again, call him.

26:28.617 --> 26:29.900
- Call now.
- Firstable I wanna give you this.

26:29.906 --> 26:31.303
It came into the production office
last night.

26:31.345 --> 26:32.660
- He sent it to you.
- What's this?

26:32.696 --> 26:34.093
Can I have a nicorette?

26:35.016 --> 26:37.320
I got a present!

26:39.347 --> 26:40.543
Thanks.

26:40.587 --> 26:42.751
Oh, I'm so excited!
I love presents so much.

Nobody gives me presents.

Oh my god!

26:53.148 --> 26:55.332
Look at this!

26:55.368 --> 26:58.223
Oh my god! This is so expensive,
I could buy a house

26:58.716 --> 27:00.960
in Cambodia with this watch.

27:01.008 --> 27:03.083
- He sent you a note. It's inside it.
- Read it.

27:03.485 --> 27:06.013
"Dear Jennifer,
there are many Lez Girls in Geneva,

27:06.057 --> 27:08.071
but none as lovely and talented as you.

27:08.105 --> 27:11.012
I'm thrilled about Niki.
She is Jessie.

27:11.048 --> 27:12.641
- William".
- No!

27:16.576 --> 27:18.530
He's trying to ruin my fucking movie!

27:18.566 --> 27:20.101
You know, I'm just gonna...

27:20.137 --> 27:21.762
Should I pick you up
to drive you to SheBar tonight?

27:21.808 --> 27:24.460
- No, I'm not going.
- No, you have to go.

27:24.495 --> 27:25.890
What?

27:27.036 --> 27:29.270
- I'm just saying...
- What do I have to do, Adele?

27:29.306 --> 27:31.200
I'm just saying that
she has been working so hard,

27:31.265 --> 27:33.273
and you deserve a really fun night,
don't you think?

27:33.306 --> 27:34.462
- Don't you think?
- You know what?

27:35.508 --> 27:37.190
I need a moment.

27:37.737 --> 27:39.321
Alright. Okay, bye.

27:42.045 --> 27:43.963
- I want you to come tonight.
- Why?

27:44.005 --> 27:45.593
- I beg you as a friend as you wat me.
- Why?

27:45.625 --> 27:48.260
Why? Because I love you
and I wanna hang out with you tonight.

27:48.297 --> 27:50.311
Yeah. And wear that dress.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.031
Why are you looking et me like that?

27:56.026 --> 27:57.763
Stop leering.

28:01.568 --> 28:03.791
Shane, you need to get laid.

28:03.827 --> 28:05.972
I only recommand one gun

28:06.008 --> 28:07.733
for women for home defense.

28:07.778 --> 28:10.672
A Smith and Weston 357 magmum revolver.

28:10.758 --> 28:11.781
You wanna feel?

28:12.665 --> 28:14.340
It's easy to use.

28:14.377 --> 28:16.061
Name is good, triggers pull quickly

28:16.106 --> 28:18.873
and depending on the type of bullet,
the recoil is low.

28:21.097 --> 28:23.543
I just want something to scare somebody.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.781
You pull out a gun, you need
to be prepared to use it.

28:25.826 --> 28:27.520
You wanna be able to protect yourself.

28:28.565 --> 28:31.400
Well, I'll just keep it without bullets.

28:31.445 --> 28:33.863
You can't fire a gun without bullets.

28:33.965 --> 28:36.193
And you load it by opening up the cylinder,

28:36.225 --> 28:37.611
like this,

28:39.395 --> 28:40.783
just drop the bullets in,

28:40.817 --> 28:42.243
close up the cylinder,

28:42.275 --> 28:43.333
and

28:43.376 --> 28:44.941
pull the trigger.

28:46.297 --> 28:47.503
Easy.

29:01.017 --> 29:02.991
I mean, that's a gun for you.

29:11.518 --> 29:13.073
<i>Can I help you?</i>

29:13.108 --> 29:15.700
Yeah. Aunt Sally's here.

29:15.737 --> 29:17.233
Aunt Sally?

29:17.276 --> 29:18.943

It's just that what we're doing here
is in another league entirely,

It's like all about hot nights,

to play Nicholas Cage's girlfriend,

38:30.337 --> 38:32.370
and he's like what 50 or something?

38:32.418 --> 38:34.803
So Niki, what's the deal?
You wanna be in my movie?

38:35.766 --> 38:37.693
More than anything.

38:38.277 --> 38:41.030
I have never wanted to be in something
so badly

38:41.088 --> 38:43.080
- in my entire life.
- Why?

38:43.116 --> 38:44.732
Because it's...

38:44.776 --> 38:46.881
It's my life. I mean,

38:46.915 --> 38:49.581
okay, it's not actually my life,
obviously, but...

38:50.936 --> 38:52.343
Have you ever just

38:52.388 --> 38:54.963
read something
that's just so true?

38:55.598 --> 38:56.660
I mean,

38:57.078 --> 39:00.513
the first time that I ever fell for a girl
it was just...

39:02.007 --> 39:04.171
it was so intense and

39:05.805 --> 39:08.291
she completely broke my heart.

39:09.086 --> 39:11.802
And as I was reading through your script,
I just,

39:12.528 --> 39:15.170
I just kept thinking
that I have done those things

39:15.206 --> 39:16.540
and I have felt these feelings,

39:16.587 --> 39:20.081
and this character, this, it's me, Jenny.
It is me.

39:25.305 --> 39:26.862
I don't know, it, it mea...

39:27.097 --> 39:30.390
It means something, you know,
that you're saying all those things. But

39:32.486 --> 39:35.102
I don't give a fuck that you're gay.

39:35.196 --> 39:38.293
- It's not gonna get you the job.
- I know.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.950
You wanted Nathalie Portman.
She's amazing.

39:40.996 --> 39:42.843
Yeah, she is. But

39:42.888 --> 39:44.551
she doesn't want to do it.

39:45.818 --> 39:46.841
Look,

39:47.558 --> 39:50.383
I know that I nailed at that audition,

39:50.416 --> 39:52.042
and I know,

39:52.075 --> 39:55.440
look, I know that everyone in that room
was completely into me.

39:55.487 --> 39:56.880
Except for you.

39:59.666 --> 40:01.051
Jenny,

40:01.156 --> 40:03.231
I mean I get it. Alright?

40:03.275 --> 40:07.462
I know what I look like and
I know why guys like me and

40:07.505 --> 40:09.762
all that fucking Hollywood bullshit. But,

40:09.808 --> 40:13.283
Jenny, there is more in me than that
and I need to prove that there is

40:13.317 --> 40:15.022
and that I can do this.

40:15.068 --> 40:18.971
I will give you everything that I have
inside of me for this role.

40:22.948 --> 40:24.280
Look,

40:24.885 --> 40:26.500
my agents

40:26.546 --> 40:27.982
already told me that

40:28.046 --> 40:31.123
the studio's going to make you hire me
no matter what.

40:31.155 --> 40:32.713
Is that what they said?

40:32.756 --> 40:33.772
Yeah.

40:35.915 --> 40:38.080
But I don't want that, Jenny.

40:38.116 --> 40:40.911
I want you to want me.
I mean, you are the director.

40:40.945 --> 40:42.613
And I would be

40:42.646 --> 40:45.661
the Jessie of your dreams, Jenny.
I promise you.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.882
- "Get Physical" by Margaret Berger -

40:50.888 --> 40:54.510
- Hey, hey, you're not leaving, are you?
- Yeah, yeah, I think it's time I should go.

40:54.557 --> 40:56.121
No, no, no. You're Shane, right?

40:56.166 --> 40:58.441
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Shane, come here.

40:58.478 --> 41:00.540
We want you to be a regular.
We heard a lot about you.

41:00.575 --> 41:02.221
Oh, I don't know.

41:02.265 --> 41:04.322
Oh, what's the matter?
Don't you like girls?

41:04.366 --> 41:06.721
No, I don't like the drama
that goes with them.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.193
Oh yeah, well.
This species is full of drama.

41:09.237 --> 41:12.252
Hey girls. The hot girls
always seem to bring the drama.

41:12.285 --> 41:13.180
I'm sorry.

41:15.675 --> 41:17.581
Welcome to the VIP room.

41:17.996 --> 41:19.701
Everybody out. Out!

41:21.927 --> 41:23.230
Let's go, let's go.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.662
Not you, baby.

41:31.015 --> 41:33.923
- Hey, how are you doing?
- I'm good.

41:34.456 --> 41:37.250
I'm glad you stayed.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.100
Yeah, well
I didn't have much of a choice.

41:41.135 --> 41:43.181
Guess what we were just
talking about, baby?

41:43.226 --> 41:44.431
What?

41:44.477 --> 41:46.111
Girls and drama.

41:47.587 --> 41:50.170
Girls in L.A. love their drama,
don't they?

41:50.208 --> 41:52.772
I think girls everywhere love their little drama.

41:52.818 --> 41:55.663
We took care of that problem
a long time ago, didn't we, baby?

41:55.715 --> 41:57.080
We sure did.

41:59.487 --> 42:00.530
Well,

42:00.565 --> 42:03.531
- you two are lucky.
- Yeah. Yeah, we're lucky.

42:03.577 --> 42:05.772
And we're completely honest.

42:05.816 --> 42:07.813
We don't cheat and

42:07.857 --> 42:09.542
we don't believe in jealousy

42:09.575 --> 42:13.531
and we put our own line and,
whatever we do, we do together.

42:15.037 --> 42:16.541
Right, baby?

42:25.545 --> 42:27.382
- "Hot Sahara"
by Fans of Jimmy Century -

42:41.055 --> 42:42.820
<b>- ...
- Yeah, I know.</b>

42:42.858 --> 42:44.450
- You can tell.
- Yeah.

42:44.497 --> 42:46.001
No drama.

43:34.415 --> 43:37.093
I am so over the SheBar.

43:37.137 --> 43:38.223
I'm outta here.

43:38.268 --> 43:39.610
Me too.

43:39.646 --> 43:40.742
Ready?

43:42.107 --> 43:44.051
I promised Shane that

43:44.097 --> 43:46.542
that I wouldn't leave without her.
So,

43:46.587 --> 43:49.793
- I'm just gonna go over.
- Okay. Do you want me to wait?

43:49.827 --> 43:51.560
No, it's fine.

43:51.595 --> 43:55.751
I mean, I have to pick up Angie
first thing tomorrow morning anyway.

43:55.788 --> 43:57.243
I totally forgot!

44:50.206 --> 44:52.503
- "Dream" by Alice Smith -

45:04.065 --> 45:06.111
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

45:09.447 --> 45:10.563
I don't know.

45:12.868 --> 45:14.952
What are you doing here?

45:15.895 --> 45:17.812
I was just looking for Shane.

45:17.848 --> 45:19.850
She disappeared and I promised her
I wouldn't

45:19.935 --> 45:21.381
leave without her. So...

45:26.048 --> 45:27.472
I'm hiding.

45:28.795 --> 45:31.760
- What?
- I'm hiding from Brenda.

45:35.086 --> 45:38.093
She's nice and everything, but,

45:38.135 --> 45:40.862
oh my god, she's fucking crazy.

45:42.096 --> 45:43.670
I can't keep up with her.

45:44.378 --> 45:47.483
I don't know where she is.
Somewhere out there dancing.

45:48.126 --> 45:51.070
But I thought you two
were so into each other.

45:52.596 --> 45:54.192
We were just having fun.

46:00.545 --> 46:02.252
This is...

46:02.295 --> 46:05.101
is so not my scene.

46:06.995 --> 46:08.901
Just, bars.

46:09.575 --> 46:11.770
I know. It's just...

46:20.868 --> 46:22.190
You're lucky.

46:23.857 --> 46:25.833
You are really lucky

46:27.207 --> 46:28.953
that you have Jodi.

46:34.556 --> 46:36.991
Yeah. I really am.
