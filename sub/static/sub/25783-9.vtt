Rashard were a 22-year-old

07:12.723 --> 07:15.264
- That would be better.
- I can make that happen.
For a price.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.055
No, no, no.
No Asian massage.

07:17.139 --> 07:19.972

No, the TV.
Rashard, turn it up, will ya?

07:25.806 --> 07:27.347
TV:
...is intrinsically corrupt.

07:27.431 --> 07:30.431
The NCAA has responded
by countersuing Strasmore,

07:30.514 --> 07:33.723
claiming that intent
to purchase the rights
for USC sports

07:33.806 --> 07:36.556
with the financial backing
of the Anderson brothers

07:36.639 --> 07:39.222
has breached his fiduciary
responsibilities.

He's your friend, man.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.222
Nope. I ain't
gonna say a damn thing,
and neither are y'all.

10:15.222 --> 10:18.014

You know...

10:18.097 --> 10:20.389
it was a common practice
in ancient Rome

10:20.472 --> 10:23.556
for the emperor to...

10:23.639 --> 10:27.139
to allow a moment
for the accused

10:27.222 --> 10:30.055
to renounce his beliefs
before going into battle.

10:30.139 --> 10:33.431
Confessions aren't my thing,
Joe, and I've never
been afraid of a fight.

10:33.514 --> 10:35.347
You haven't been thrown
to lions, either.

10:35.431 --> 10:38.889
They're a lot more ferocious
than guys in 3-point stances.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.930
Well, maybe I'm dumb,
but I have no fear.

10:42.014 --> 10:44.930

Don't be naive.

10:45.014 --> 10:47.723

The way you rationalize shit!

11:15.139 --> 11:17.930
You took $250 million

11:18.014 --> 11:19.306
from the brothers Anderson,

11:19.389 --> 11:23.139
and you partnered
with a 17-year-old boy

11:23.222 --> 11:25.972
on a regional sports network.

11:26.055 --> 11:30.180
Do you have any idea
how fucked up you are?!

11:31.681 --> 11:34.055
I do.

11:34.139 --> 11:36.389
And none of it's
gonna affect you.

11:41.806 --> 11:43.097
Great. Thank you.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.556
Nothing more valuable
than a guarantee from a liar.

11:49.306 --> 11:51.139
( typing )

11:51.222 --> 11:52.639
- ( beep )
- Bring me Jerret's contract!

11:52.723 --> 11:54.472
Shoulda been waiting
on my desk already.

11:54.556 --> 11:56.723
Andrew: Sorry, sir.
Bringing it now.

11:56.806 --> 11:58.264
What's up, Rick.

11:58.347 --> 11:59.889
So, Greane,

11:59.972 --> 12:01.639
let's get this goin'
and signed

12:01.723 --> 12:03.139
so I can get back to doing
what I do best.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.889
Settle in. Ain't no rush.

12:07.389 --> 12:09.556
Slow down.
Enjoy the moment, brother.

12:09.639 --> 12:14.222
I have to admit, I really
didn't want this to happen
for a while.

12:14.306 --> 12:17.723
When that whole situation
with the Whites went down,

12:17.806 --> 12:19.848
I didn't know what to do.

12:19.930 --> 12:23.681
It's funny, though,
the whole thing, it just...

12:23.764 --> 12:25.723
challenged my character,

12:25.806 --> 12:27.764
and I came out the other side
the better for it.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.681
How'd it challenge
your character?

12:30.764 --> 12:33.014
Well, by forcing me
to choose a side, for one.

12:33.097 --> 12:35.347
Guess we know
how that turned out.

12:35.431 --> 12:37.723
We sure do. Sittin' there
right in front of you.

12:37.806 --> 12:40.306
Go ahead and sign up,
baby. Congratulations.

12:40.389 --> 12:43.389
You know, Chuck, character
is a crazy-ass thing.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.180
Don't know what it is,
but you know what it isn't.

12:46.264 --> 12:48.431
Hmm. Well said, Rick.

12:48.514 --> 12:50.972
Pour myself a drink
on that note.

12:52.639 --> 12:56.764
Sometimes we don't...
recognize it in ourselves...

12:56.848 --> 12:58.639
- till it's too late...
- Hmm.

12:58.723 --> 13:01.055
- ( ice clinking )
- ...and the damage
has been done.

13:01.139 --> 13:04.055
Me myself, I'm of the mind
that it's never too late.

13:04.139 --> 13:05.848
I don't think
we should go there, Chuck.

13:05.930 --> 13:09.848
Hmm?
Go where?

13:09.930 --> 13:12.472
Lay on you
what I been cookin' up.

13:12.556 --> 13:14.347
Aw, shucks.

13:14.431 --> 13:16.681
I just had a full plate
of steak and eggs,

13:16.764 --> 13:19.014
so whatever you cookin',
you can keep to yourself.

13:19.097 --> 13:20.889
God is speaking to me
right now.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.389
He ain't speakin' to me.

13:22.472 --> 13:23.556
Don't lock the Lord out,
bro.

13:23.639 --> 13:25.681
Ricky, is this
gonna upset me?

13:25.764 --> 13:28.848
'Cause if it is,
just... keep it to yourself.

13:30.264 --> 13:32.180
I been usin' PEDs.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.347
What'd I just say?

13:35.431 --> 13:38.014
What did I say?
I told you not to tell me!

13:38.097 --> 13:39.972
What is wrong with you, Ricky?

13:40.055 --> 13:42.139
What is this
undying need you have

13:42.222 --> 13:44.723
to fuck over
the people who love you?

13:46.764 --> 13:49.180
Dammit!
Goddamn!

13:51.055 --> 13:54.806
Let me tell you
how this plays out
from here on forward.

13:54.889 --> 13:57.014
If you play great,
we're winners.

13:57.097 --> 14:00.055
If you test dirty after--
say, the fifth game
or something like that--

14:00.139 --> 14:01.806
I'm clippin' your punk ass.

14:01.889 --> 14:04.180
No conversation,
no apology, no bullshit,

14:04.264 --> 14:08.180
no "Wait, Chuck,
I need to talk"--
none of that.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.264
You never told me.

14:10.347 --> 14:12.222
- Hey! You understand?!
- Yeah.

14:12.306 --> 14:14.889
You never told me. Ever!

14:14.972 --> 14:17.848
Now sign the motherfuckin' deal,
you piece of shit.

14:32.389 --> 14:34.639
Glazed and Confused,
on location,

14:34.723 --> 14:36.139
coming to you live here

14:36.222 --> 14:38.139
from sunny
Southern California.

14:38.222 --> 14:40.264
I've gotten a lot of
big stories in my day,

14:40.347 --> 14:43.556
but really nothing compares
to what you're about to see.

14:43.639 --> 14:45.764
Some stories are local,
some are national,

14:45.848 --> 14:47.972
this one changes the world.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.014
With that, I welcome
the one and only
Spencer Strasmore

14:51.097 --> 14:54.556
on the day that he dropped
a massive lawsuit on the NCAA.

14:54.639 --> 14:56.431
Sometimes the only way
to affect change

14:56.514 --> 14:58.347
is with a fight, Jay,
you know that.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.723
Whether it's college athletes,

14:59.806 --> 15:01.681
college athletics,
or the world at large...

15:01.764 --> 15:05.514
You beg me to go for a run,
and now you got your face
buried in your phone?

15:05.598 --> 15:07.639
...the modern era,
and that hasn't happened yet,

15:07.723 --> 15:09.180
and I for one
am fuckin' sick of it.

15:09.264 --> 15:10.681
This fuckin' guy.

15:10.764 --> 15:13.014
I ask him to do me a favor
for my friend Jayda,

15:13.097 --> 15:14.347
and in pure Spencer fashion

15:14.431 --> 15:16.180
he goes out
and pimps her son instead.

15:16.264 --> 15:17.806
- Did you fuck her?
- Fuck who?

15:17.889 --> 15:19.681
You know who the fuck who.
Your friend Jayda.

15:19.764 --> 15:22.014
I didn't fuck her.
She's a friend from law school.

15:22.097 --> 15:24.556
What kind of whore
do you think I am?

15:25.889 --> 15:27.681
I'm the one gettin' fucked.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.347
Now I'm getting
ready to go Old School,
Curt Flood style,

15:30.431 --> 15:32.097
so get ready
for the revolution.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.806
First and foremost, Jay...

15:33.889 --> 15:36.598
Thinks he's fuckin'
Billy Graham.

15:36.681 --> 15:38.723
Sweetheart!
Balvenie, neat.

15:38.806 --> 15:41.431
First of all, her name
isn't "sweetheart,"
it's Hannah.

15:41.514 --> 15:45.889
Secondly, I just gave you
a new kidney. I'd appreciate it
if you didn't abuse it.

15:45.972 --> 15:47.389
I don't care
what her name is,

15:47.472 --> 15:50.264
the kidney you gave me
was far from new,

15:50.347 --> 15:52.222
and now that it's
in my custody,

15:52.306 --> 15:54.097
I'll do with it
as I please.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.681
...peace of mind
because with this,

15:55.764 --> 15:57.972
they are going to
come at you hard.

15:58.055 --> 16:00.180
What the sports world
needs to understand is,

16:00.264 --> 16:02.431
whether it's Chapel Hill,
whether it's Lubbock,

16:02.514 --> 16:04.222
Stillwater or Tallahassee,

16:04.306 --> 16:06.723
there is a street
and a stadium

16:06.806 --> 16:08.972
that has been built
on the back of a kid

16:09.055 --> 16:10.639
who used to play there.

16:10.723 --> 16:12.264
Some of them went on
to greatness,

16:12.347 --> 16:14.889
but many more
ended up anonymous.

16:14.972 --> 16:17.264
The sad part is,
they weren't able
to cash in

16:17.347 --> 16:19.306
when they had
something worth selling.

16:19.389 --> 16:21.514
Coaches, professors,
tennis players,

16:21.598 --> 16:23.222
snotnose dot-com wannabes,

16:23.306 --> 16:25.222
they can all max out
on their talents--

16:25.306 --> 16:27.389
except football players.

16:28.431 --> 16:30.097
And that ain't right.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.598
That's bullshit.

16:31.681 --> 16:34.055
Everybody deserves
to earn a few beans.

16:34.139 --> 16:35.556
Hell yeah, they do, paisan.

16:35.639 --> 16:37.514
It's time these kids
gain control,

16:37.598 --> 16:39.472
because when they're done,
no one will know who they are.

16:39.556 --> 16:41.972
Glazer: It really is
a tragedy of the unknown.

16:42.055 --> 16:44.222
Spencer: Names, faces,
people, families--

16:44.306 --> 16:46.764
they've all given more
than they've gotten back.

16:46.848 --> 16:48.723
This is starting
to sound personal for you.

16:48.806 --> 16:52.097
It is.
I'm talkin' about family.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.681
And when I talk family,
I'm talkin' about my brother,

16:54.764 --> 16:57.222
William Strasmore II,
who was named after my Pops.

16:57.306 --> 16:59.806
I had a chance to meet him
back in the day.

16:59.889 --> 17:01.222
That kid loved to play.

17:01.306 --> 17:03.806
And his greatest joy was
always on the football field,

17:03.889 --> 17:05.556
and that was taken
away from him.

17:05.639 --> 17:07.222
Are you talkin'
about the shoulder injury?

17:07.306 --> 17:08.972
I'm talkin' about
these bullshit rules--

17:09.055 --> 17:11.014
the transfer rules
that let the coaches leave,

17:11.097 --> 17:12.306
but yet lock the players up.

17:12.389 --> 17:14.472
The sneaker deals
for the programs,

17:14.556 --> 17:17.598
and these fucking ridiculous
eligibility rulings,

17:17.681 --> 17:21.222
it's all just another way
to keep these players in check.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.306
They wouldn't reinstate him.

17:23.389 --> 17:26.180
They wouldn't give him back
his last year of eligibility.

17:26.264 --> 17:28.472
It's just typical
institutional bullshit.

17:28.556 --> 17:30.472
This has clearly
taken a toll on you.

17:30.556 --> 17:32.306
It's put me in
a very dark place.

17:32.389 --> 17:33.806
But I'm not looking
for sympathy, I don't need it.

17:33.889 --> 17:35.806
I'm only looking
for accountability.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.180
They took his career
because of a rule.

17:38.264 --> 17:40.806
But from me,
they took my brother

17:40.889 --> 17:44.264
and all the things
that we were destined
to experience together.

17:44.347 --> 17:48.556
An achievement means nothing
unless you can share it
with the ones you love.

17:48.639 --> 17:52.639
So this fight is in memory
of William Strasmore II,

17:52.723 --> 17:55.055
and all the other Williams
coming up.

17:57.472 --> 18:00.598
The NCAA has officially
been put on notice.

18:00.681 --> 18:02.972
Joe:
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.

18:03.055 --> 18:04.598
Take that sound bite, OK?

18:04.681 --> 18:06.598
Take that clip right there,

18:06.681 --> 18:09.264
have every single
employee here post it,

18:09.347 --> 18:12.556
tweet it, 'Gram it,
Snap' it, blast it,

18:12.639 --> 18:14.930
call in favors
to all of our media contacts,

18:15.014 --> 18:16.514
traditional and social.

18:16.598 --> 18:18.764
Carpet-bomb the motherfuckers.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.764
Operation William has begun.

18:34.139 --> 18:37.848
Feels good to be off the 405
and up high in the sky, huh?

18:37.930 --> 18:40.806
Sorry for those of you
expecting Sarah Huckabee--

18:40.889 --> 18:43.889
she was busy...
searchin' for the truth.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.389
( laughter )

18:45.472 --> 18:48.014
Today we continue
our undying pursuit

18:48.097 --> 18:49.889
of bringing a Super Bowl
to Los Angeles.

18:49.972 --> 18:52.972
And it is with the full support
of Mr. Kroenke and Coach McVay

18:53.055 --> 18:56.264
that I'm here to announce
that our future has gotten
a little bit brighter

18:56.347 --> 18:59.598
and we've gotten one step closer
to achieving that goal.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.598
It is with great pleasure
that I can announce

19:01.681 --> 19:04.514
my very first
free agent signing as GM.

19:04.598 --> 19:07.806
This young man
is someone I've known
on the gridiron and off,

19:07.889 --> 19:09.930
we've forged a bond,

19:10.014 --> 19:12.014
we go back to
our days in Florida,

19:12.097 --> 19:14.055
he's a special player
and a special man.

19:14.139 --> 19:15.514
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:15.598 --> 19:17.264
please join me in welcoming

19:17.347 --> 19:19.681
the one, the only...

19:19.764 --> 19:22.347
Mr. Kisan Teague!

19:22.431 --> 19:24.055
( all applauding )

19:24.139 --> 19:25.180
There he is.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.431
Put that on.

19:29.514 --> 19:31.848
- ( camera shutters click )
- Wow.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.222
Man.

19:35.306 --> 19:38.889
As a kid who grew up in L.A.,

19:38.972 --> 19:41.806
this is truly a special moment
for me, it really is.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.806
I can't stress enough
how excited I am to be here,

19:44.889 --> 19:46.681
be with this organization,

19:46.764 --> 19:49.389
help them win them Super Bowls
that you were talkin' about.

19:49.472 --> 19:51.889
I might even start
drinking almond milk
or something, I don't know.

19:51.972 --> 19:54.306
What y'all think? That's what
y'all do out here, right?

19:54.389 --> 19:56.889
Seriously,
as Dorothy once said,

19:56.972 --> 19:58.389
there's no place
like home, baby.

19:58.472 --> 20:00.472
Especially if home
is Newport Beach.

20:00.556 --> 20:02.472
( laughter )

20:02.556 --> 20:04.806
Kisan: Don't say that,
Tasha listenin' in.

20:04.889 --> 20:06.472
Charles:
Any questions for the man?

20:06.556 --> 20:09.097
- ( reporters clamor )

20:47.514 --> 20:48.806
Given your physical states,

20:48.889 --> 20:50.222
I'd be happy
to jump into yours.

20:50.306 --> 20:52.431
Not even if I was
in peak physical condition

20:52.514 --> 20:53.848
and desperately gay.

20:53.930 --> 20:55.306
What the fuck
are you doing here, Joe?

20:55.389 --> 20:57.556
Pick up our bags,
take us to the hotel?

20:57.639 --> 20:59.681
No, I wasn't
planning on that,

20:59.764 --> 21:03.180
but if that's what it
takes for you to delay your
execution of Spencer's deal,

21:03.264 --> 21:04.598
then I am happy to do it.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.514
The only satellite bill
we're willing to pay for

21:06.598 --> 21:08.889
is our monthly DirecTV,
and even that's too much.

21:08.972 --> 21:11.723
Listen, I understand
that you guys are disappointed

21:11.806 --> 21:13.681
in the way that things
have unfolded,

21:13.764 --> 21:14.848
perhaps even frustrated.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.264
"Perhaps even frustrated."

21:16.347 --> 21:18.431
Where'd you get
that idea from?

21:18.514 --> 21:22.139
Because frustration is a state
that I perpetually live in.

21:22.222 --> 21:24.889
But I am here
to tell both of you that

21:24.972 --> 21:27.055
that is changing--
rapidly.

21:27.139 --> 21:28.764
Not rapidly enough for us.

21:28.848 --> 21:30.222
It's imminent.

21:30.306 --> 21:34.556
Listen, "Spencer Strasmore"
is trending.

21:34.639 --> 21:36.806
- You just say "trending"?
- Yeah.

21:36.889 --> 21:39.431
- What the fuck is trending?
- Social media, grandpa.

21:39.514 --> 21:41.723
All the kids are doin' it.
Postin' food and stuff,

21:41.806 --> 21:43.347
dogs, fuckin' kangaroos...

21:43.431 --> 21:44.848
I think I get it.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.639
Spencer sent you out here
with a boatload of horseshit

21:47.723 --> 21:49.306
to do his bidding for him.

21:49.389 --> 21:51.222
- Is that the idea?
- No, I came on my own.

21:51.306 --> 21:54.514
I don't think you guys
are grasping the situation here.

21:54.598 --> 21:56.514
People are talking
about Spencer.

21:56.598 --> 21:58.806
And we're supposed to care?

21:58.889 --> 22:00.806
Well, they do.

22:00.889 --> 22:03.264
Let me show you
what's going on here.

22:03.347 --> 22:05.431
- Look at this.
- Oh, boy.

22:05.514 --> 22:10.222
"Spencer is single-handedly
changing the face
of college athletics.

22:10.306 --> 22:11.930
- He is effecting change."
- Right.

22:12.014 --> 22:13.264
How does that benefit us?

22:13.347 --> 22:14.930
I'm sure he has a plan.

22:15.014 --> 22:17.264
Oh, he's got a plan.
Would you bet your life on that?

22:17.347 --> 22:19.764
Would you bet your legacies
that he doesn't?

22:19.848 --> 22:21.389
Let me ask you this question:

22:21.472 --> 22:23.222
What side of history
do you guys want to be on,

22:23.306 --> 22:27.097
the greedy white men robbing
young urban superstars
of their futures?

22:27.180 --> 22:29.681
It's the foundation upon which
this country was built.

22:29.764 --> 22:32.972
Or do you want to
fight for equality
and get rich in the process?

22:33.055 --> 22:35.139
You're living
in a dream world, Joe.

22:35.222 --> 22:36.972
Those two things
don't go together.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.306
In this case, they do, Bret.

22:39.389 --> 22:41.972
Twelve-year-old tech geniuses
in Palo Alto

22:42.055 --> 22:44.889
could buy and sell your asses
a hundred times over.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.139
A moron bullshitted his way
into the Oval Office

22:48.222 --> 22:51.139
by doing nothing more
than lying and doubling down.

22:51.222 --> 22:54.972
- Careful.
- The world has changed.

22:55.055 --> 22:58.347
You guys may as well
take credit for it.

23:06.139 --> 23:08.514
- Do I need to call security?
- I wouldn't imagine.

23:08.598 --> 23:10.723
- Is there a private room
we can use?
- Sure is.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.222
- Would you like me to leave
these gentlemen behind?
- Fuck no.

23:13.306 --> 23:16.097
I like to leave
a witness alive.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.514
Quincy Crawford
is a special player,

23:18.598 --> 23:23.514
and it would be a shame
for him to be denied the chance
to play collegiate football.

23:23.598 --> 23:26.180
I realize that
I could never forgive myself

23:26.264 --> 23:30.389
if I didn't do
everything I could
to make that happen.

23:30.472 --> 23:34.681
And think about
all the potential
revenue lost. Hmm?

23:34.764 --> 23:36.764
( laughs )
So jaded.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.889
My people may have been
a little heavy-handed

23:38.972 --> 23:40.472
in dealing with the situation,

23:40.556 --> 23:44.639
but I'm offering you
Quincy's eligibility back.

23:45.806 --> 23:48.097
He will be reinstated
immediately,

23:48.180 --> 23:50.930
as long as you agree
to drop the suit.

23:54.014 --> 23:56.764
- No chance.
- Excuse me?

23:56.848 --> 23:59.139
Unfortunately for Quincy,
but mostly for you,

23:59.222 --> 24:01.306
this whole thing is
much bigger than all of us,

24:01.389 --> 24:03.639
so my answer is no.

24:05.055 --> 24:06.431
You are one arrogant fuck.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.972
It's one of
my greatest qualities.

24:09.055 --> 24:10.806
But I have an offer for you.

24:12.222 --> 24:14.347
You reinstate Quincy
immediately,

24:14.431 --> 24:16.222
and you pay the players.

24:16.306 --> 24:18.639
( laughing )

24:18.723 --> 24:21.347

24:42.556 --> 24:44.598
nobody has to walk

24:44.681 --> 24:47.681
No, because you already

Sorry. Sorry. Dude,

I'm really not.

you should focus on yourself.

25:08.347 --> 25:11.556
I mean, you've earned it.
You got this place hummin'.

25:11.639 --> 25:12.930
Yeah,
thank you for noticing.

25:13.014 --> 25:16.139
The team has worked
very, very hard.

25:16.222 --> 25:19.806
But you know
I would chuck it away
in one second,

25:19.889 --> 25:22.347
go down on the proverbial ship,
right?

25:22.431 --> 25:24.806
I actually look forward to it,
to tell you the truth.

25:24.889 --> 25:26.431
Me and you
floating in the ocean,

25:26.514 --> 25:29.306
Celine Dion playing
"My Heart Will Go On,"
some shit like that?

25:29.389 --> 25:32.139
I've proven to myself
that I can lead,

25:32.222 --> 25:35.389
so I'm good with
whatever follows.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.556
What the fuck

25:45.889 --> 25:48.514
I'm making good

25:48.598 --> 25:50.598
I said that I wouldn't
let any of this affect you

25:50.681 --> 25:53.389
or anybody that works here
or at ASM, and I won't.

25:53.472 --> 25:55.055
I'm resigning.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.681
- You're what?
- I'm out, brother.

25:59.764 --> 26:01.431
It's all yours.

26:02.806 --> 26:05.306
I'm sorry I dragged you
through it.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.889
I heard what you said.

26:07.972 --> 26:09.514
I don't accept it.

26:09.598 --> 26:11.556
So if you brought some
eloquent letter,

26:11.639 --> 26:13.472
keep it in your pocket--
fuckin' burn it, I don't know.

26:13.556 --> 26:15.264
I do not accept it.

26:18.097 --> 26:19.431
Don't have to worry
about them.

Sportscaster:
...with an outpouring
of support

27:06.930 --> 27:08.431
for quarterback Crawford,

27:08.514 --> 27:11.097
the NCAA has relented
on their declaration.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.889
In a matter of moments,
Signing Day will begin.

27:13.972 --> 27:17.055
And with that, we go live
to Santa Ana, California,

27:17.139 --> 27:19.055
to the home of Quincy Crawford.

27:19.139 --> 27:22.389
Now that the NCAA has
reinstated Crawford's
eligibility,

27:22.472 --> 27:26.180
chances are the rich
are about to get richer.

27:26.264 --> 27:28.723
One top-flight program
is about to land

27:28.806 --> 27:31.222
the most sought-after
high school recruit in history.

Hey, uh... listen,
I've been thinking.

30:14.889 --> 30:19.347
I remember Joe thinkin',
high on 'shrooms
back in the day,

30:19.431 --> 30:22.431
thinkin' out there
on the mental-edge lands,

30:22.514 --> 30:24.889
crazy and howling
into the night.

30:24.972 --> 30:26.264

30:26.347 --> 30:28.514
We never found out
who she was, did we?

30:28.598 --> 30:30.431
That was my wife.

30:30.514 --> 30:32.598
You didn't make that clear
in your ranting.

30:32.681 --> 30:36.723

we bring back
the good old days,

30:36.806 --> 30:39.889
and-- and you...

30:39.972 --> 30:42.389
buy back into the company
and we partner up again.

30:43.848 --> 30:45.347

the other man?

30:51.723 --> 30:53.306
Yeah, without the other man.

30:53.389 --> 30:55.431
I can tell you don't really
want to get into that,

30:55.514 --> 30:57.139
and I seen the news and stuff,

30:57.222 --> 30:59.306
I can't imagine
how you're feeling,

30:59.389 --> 31:02.014

chaise longue right now,

Fuck it.
