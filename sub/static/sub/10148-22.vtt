WEBVTT

01:19.080 --> 01:20.289
Opening-nightjitters?

01:20.665 --> 01:22.541
He's scared, Harold. That's what it is.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.585
Shut up! We got no reason to be scared.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.462
We're not punk kids anymore.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.006
We're special.
We're gonna own this city.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.591
And here are the keys.

01:30.675 --> 01:31.592
Whoo-hoo!

01:31.676 --> 01:32.676
Yeah!

01:33.803 --> 01:35.221
Yo. Thanks, Harold.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.139
You know, I never liked that name.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.350
I need something more appropriate now.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.143
Like "bullwhip."

01:45.106 --> 01:46.107
Whoo-hoo!

01:47.483 --> 01:48.483
You're up.

02:09.714 --> 02:10.714
You keep watch.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.010
Hey!

03:03.476 --> 03:04.476
Ahhh!

03:57.613 --> 03:58.447
Cops.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.032
I don't want this to turn into a war.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.366
Not tonight.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.655
What's this?

04:45.911 --> 04:47.705
This wasn't part of the bargain.
You said...

04:47.788 --> 04:49.623
The bargain's anything I want it to be.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.124
Understand?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.130
How's it feeling?

04:57.423 --> 04:59.508
It hurts. That's how it's feeling.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.517
One of your servo motors is missing.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.519
So get me another one!

05:10.728 --> 05:13.564
I will, but you can't just
leave them laying around.

05:13.772 --> 05:14.940
Just fix it, will ya?

05:15.399 --> 05:18.110
And don't worry about stuff
that isn't any of your business.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.406
Looks like the servo motors
in my costume.

05:22.615 --> 05:23.699
Exactly like them.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.784
I bought yours years ago from a doctor

05:25.868 --> 05:28.787
who specialized in prosthetics
for people who'd lost limbs.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.291
His name was Peter Corso,
and this is definitely one of his.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.710
Looks like the good doctor
isn't so good anymore.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.754
I'm gonna do some tests on this motor.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.797
There's something odd
about the circuitry.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.133
And I suggest you go make a house call.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.723
You should be able to stand now.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.018
Looks like I'm in working order again.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.438
All of me.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.691
You'll understand if I don't invite you
to stay for coffee and cake.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.923
So how you doing, all right?

06:02.947 --> 06:05.032
Yeah, ready to rock 'n' roll.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.159
Guess we got off
on the wrong foot tonight, Doc.

06:07.243 --> 06:08.536
Maybe this'll make it up to you.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.830
You know what I want
and it's not jewels.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.083
Then you're just going to
have to be patient.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.501
For how much longer?

06:15.584 --> 06:17.670
Until I'm sure
we don't need you anymore.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.027
Why'd you do it, Doctor?

06:42.403 --> 06:44.071
Money? Thrills?

06:44.446 --> 06:45.739
You wouldn't understand.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.073
Try me.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.577
It's a long story.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.516
Oh, no.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.355
This is what an idiot looks like, Max.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.199
I let him trick me,
and then while I was out,

07:20.274 --> 07:21.483
he moved his whole operation.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.776
I'm never gonna find him.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.570
Ter, you're forgetting something.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.821
While you were unconscious,

07:25.904 --> 07:28.282
he had a perfect chance
to get rid of you for good,

07:28.365 --> 07:29.365
but he didn't.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.575
What's that tell you?

07:30.993 --> 07:31.993
That”

07:32.036 --> 07:34.121
That maybe he's not
such a bad guy after all.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.204
Let's find out.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.005
It's not as nice as your old place,

07:43.088 --> 07:44.923
but at least you've got room to expand.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.426
I can't even go back to my own home now.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.887
Could be a lot worse, couldn't it?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.305
Couldn't it?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.142
Hello?

07:57.728 --> 07:59.229
I thought I made it clear last night.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.898
I'm taking a leave of absence.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.650
An emergency?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.278
Both legs, you say?

08:07.363 --> 08:08.489
Did you get an address?

08:09.198 --> 08:10.198
Mmm-hmm.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.741
Mmm-hmm.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.160
I'll see what I can do.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.494
What was that about?

08:14.536 --> 08:16.038
A chance to do some good,

08:16.497 --> 08:17.497
for a change.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.945
Hello? It's Dr. Corso.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.571
You called for me?

08:49.655 --> 08:50.655
In here.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.498
My service said that
both of your legs were...

09:04.461 --> 09:05.462
No tricks this time.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.134
They're gonna kill her now.
They're gonna kill her.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.344
Who? Who are they gonna kill?

09:12.886 --> 09:13.886
My Wife.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.889
It's the truth.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.267
Why else do you think
I'd be helping those punks?

09:24.440 --> 09:25.440
This her?

09:25.858 --> 09:27.818
Yes. April.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.320
April changed my whole life.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.740
Have you ever met anyone like that?

09:34.324 --> 09:37.786
I spent 20 years working day and night
to help other people,

09:37.870 --> 09:39.413
but my own life was empty.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.542
<i>All I had was my work.</i>

09:59.641 --> 10:00.642
Dr. Corso?

10:03.353 --> 10:04.229
Hmm'?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.982
Good morning. I'm your new nurse, April.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.359
I thought you might want some breakfast.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.533
Flaky Flakes?
They're for children, aren't they?

10:16.617 --> 10:18.577
I have a feeling
you've never tried them.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.954
Even when you were a child yourself.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.539
It's that obvious, huh?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.374
Mmm.

10:25.918 --> 10:26.918
Not bad.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.337
See what you've been missing?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.300
<i>That's how it started.</i>

10:33.717 --> 10:35.052
<i>With a bowl of cereal.</i>

10:36.053 --> 10:39.097
<i>It only took me a couple of weeks
to make up my mind about her.</i>

10:39.723 --> 10:41.225
April, could you please clean this?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.703
<i>It was about six months ago
that I met Harold.</i>

11:02.120 --> 11:03.914
<i>That's what he called himself back then.</i>

11:04.289 --> 11:05.415
<i>Not "bullwhip."</i>

11:06.333 --> 11:09.962
<i>I'd done a wrist replacement for him,
but he wanted more.</i>

11:10.170 --> 11:12.548
You know, Doc,
when it comes to mixing flesh and metal,

11:12.965 --> 11:14.132
you're a genius.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.261
You could probably do things
other doctors never even dream of.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.679
I'm serious.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.224
You could use your prosthetics
to make people stronger.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.643
Faster, more dangerous.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.979
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.399
With the right partners,
you could get very rich.

11:30.732 --> 11:31.775
Not interested.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.986
I've already got everything I want.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.820
Everything.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.579
<i>About a week later,
I came back late from an emergency call.</i>

11:43.996 --> 11:44.996
April?

11:45.664 --> 11:46.664
April?

11:54.631 --> 11:55.631
April!

11:56.216 --> 11:57.301
April!

11:57.676 --> 11:58.676
Hiya, Doc.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.371
Still think you've got everything?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.895
Where is she? What did you do with her?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.313
Easy. Easy.

12:10.439 --> 12:11.815
April's with a friend of ours.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.650
All you gotta do
is give us a little surgery

12:13.734 --> 12:14.735
and we'll hand her back.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.278
How do I know she's even alive?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.291
- <i>Hello?</i>
- April, it's me.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.085
- Are you okay?
- I'm so <i>scared.</i>

12:32.294 --> 12:33.294
Where are you?

12:33.462 --> 12:36.006
That's all you get.
Now, do we have a deal?

12:36.298 --> 12:38.592
What guarantee do I have
you'll give her back?

12:39.176 --> 12:40.218
Come on, Doc.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.804
If I trust you
to fool around with my insides,

12:42.888 --> 12:44.056
you really ought to trust me.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.065
April.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.859
And there's the moon in the background.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.569
Like that old song, "April Moon"?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.488
Yeah. It was our song.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.198
Any idea where they're keeping her?

13:01.323 --> 13:02.157
None.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.909
I can understand how you feel.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.244
But to let those monsters loose...

13:06.495 --> 13:07.663
There's no way to stop them.

13:07.955 --> 13:08.955
Oh, yes, there is.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.084
I slipped fail-safe devices
into all four of them.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.545
Once I get April back,
I'm going to activate them with relish.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.047
Fail-safe devices?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.484
How would you get close enough
to switch them on?

13:19.508 --> 13:21.551
They're not activated by switches.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.887
- What, then?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.140
I don't want you risking April's life
in some crazy rescue attempt.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.429
- [But-{chainsaw whirring]

13:40.404 --> 13:42.781
You followed me. Thank God.
It was a trap.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.825
You may be a good doctor,

13:44.908 --> 13:47.077
but you sure don't have
any street smarts.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.412
We'll take it from here.

14:08.849 --> 14:09.849
Oh!

14:26.033 --> 14:27.743
Back, everybody. It's my turn.

14:59.900 --> 15:00.984
Look at him run from us.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.944
Now the city really is ours.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.535
You see where the doc went?

15:10.911 --> 15:13.205
No, I lost track of him
in all the confusion.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.648
He probably got scared
and ran off.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.416
He'll be back at the warehouse
soon enough.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.877
I bet he'll be more careful
next time.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.226
It worked.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.520
I'm following them right now.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.647
<i>This might help you.</i>

15:38.730 --> 15:41.441
Remember when I said
there was something odd about the servo?

15:41.733 --> 15:42.984
It was a cutoff circuit.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.320
Yeah, I know. It's a fail-safe switch.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.614
But did you know it's voice-activated?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.618
So that's how you stop them,
some kind of code phrase.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.328
Any idea what it is?

15:53.411 --> 15:54.246
<i>It would have to be something</i>

15:54.329 --> 15:56.706
<i>not likely to be heard
in casual conversation,</i>

15:56.998 --> 16:00.168
and it's probably words that have
special significance to the doctor.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.796
- That's the best you can do?
- I'm <i>only human.</i>

16:02.879 --> 16:03.879
I keep forgetting.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.895
Yeah, that was schway.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.647
- Who's thirsty?
- Grab me a can.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.900
Still no answer at the doc's place.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.735
He'll be back. He's no fool.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.780
I figured you'd try this.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.824
That's why I followed you
from the hotel.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.952
I didn't believe for a second
you'd really run from them like that.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.650
It was just a trick
so you could tail them and find April.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.832
Looks like it's working so far,
doesn't it?

16:39.291 --> 16:40.667
You gonna tell me the secret word?

16:41.626 --> 16:43.003
So you figured it out.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.338
It doesn't matter. I told you before.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.132
I don't want you trying to rescue her.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.801
If anything happened to her
I don't know what I'd...

16:49.885 --> 16:51.325
- [So, what did you bring me?
498898]

16:52.512 --> 16:53.930
Hope it's something good.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.433
Just a little number
I picked up this morning.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.770
Bet the doc never gave you
anything like this.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.647
He could never afford to.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.316
You got anything for me?

17:09.154 --> 17:10.154
No! No!

17:16.536 --> 17:17.537
Somebody's out there.

17:25.962 --> 17:26.962
There he is.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.634
Argh!

18:07.170 --> 18:08.797
Hey, mind if I cut in?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.006
Be my guest.

18:10.632 --> 18:11.633
Finish him off.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.355
April Moon.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.248
April Moon.

19:03.935 --> 19:04.936
April Moon.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.789
And when I went back to the cellar
the doctor was gone.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.184
I guess I should've spent
more time looking for him,

19:27.208 --> 19:28.293
but my heart wasn't in it.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.376
I understand.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.379
What about April and Bullwhip?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.298
Gone, too. Both of them.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.675
They'll be back. They always come back.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.093
Tell me something, though.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.763
Does Bullwhip know
that the doctor saw him with April?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.223
No way, by the time
he came out of the townhouse,

19:42.307 --> 19:43.659
I'd already put the doctor
in the cellar.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.727
Then maybe Bullwhip
won't be coming back.

19:45.977 --> 19:46.977
Why do you say that?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.482
I sure am glad
you didn't leave town, Doc.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.067
I couldn't.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.902
Oh, yeah. April.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.904
Don't worry. She's doing fine.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.615
- Can't wait to see you again.
- Uh-huh.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.910
You do this one last
thing for me and she's all yours.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.036
Uh-huh.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.371
But don't just repair me.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.831
Make me stronger, less vulnerable, too.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.542
And don't hold back, understand?

20:09.626 --> 20:10.668
I understand.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.256
No holding back.
