WEBVTT

00:46.922 --> 00:48.005
Why are you late?

00:48.132 --> 00:50.425
- You're not going to like the answer.
- I already know the answer.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.592
I missed the bus.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.262
I don't doubt it.
No bus stops near Brad's.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.014
You spent the night,
the alarm didn't work, or maybe it did.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.683
I didn't sleep with him.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.727
- Girl, either there's something...
- I missed the bus!

01:00.853 --> 01:02.019
There's something either
very wrong with you

01:02.146 --> 01:04.272
or there's something
very wrong with him.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.606
There's nothing wrong with him.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.442
Please tell me
you know that for a fact.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.818
Melanie, I gotta go.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.069
You're lying, aren't you?

01:10.195 --> 01:13.030
I wouldn't lie to you.
Good morning, guys!

01:13.157 --> 01:15.324
Good morning, Ms. Rebecca!

01:15.451 --> 01:16.784
Everybody's in their seats?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.035
Yes.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.371
Okay.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.168
Sydney, why don't you tell us
what you did this weekend?

01:25.377 --> 01:28.212
Come on, Sydney.
We know you're not shy.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.757
How come we always have to tell you
what we did,

01:30.883 --> 01:32.091
and you never tell us what you did?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.136
Okay.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.556
I had a really great weekend.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.349
But you can't tell Ms. Melanie, okay?

01:40.476 --> 01:42.143
What did you do?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.687
I made a new friend.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.856
It's so much fun to make new friends,
isn't it?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.608
Yeah. Yeah.

01:48.734 --> 01:52.069
Did you tell your mom and dad
about your new friend?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.405
Absolutely.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.700
You should never keep anything
from your parents.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.659
And I told mine...

02:26.772 --> 02:31.275
"C-A-L...

02:32.194 --> 02:34.779
"H-E... The."

02:34.988 --> 02:36.989
We know that word. "The."

03:02.808 --> 03:04.267
Twenty-nine-year-old female.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.768
First seizure one month ago.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.270
Lost the ability to speak.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.729
Babbled like a baby.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.065
Progressive deterioration of
mental status.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.108
You see that?

03:12.234 --> 03:14.694
They all assume that I'm a patient
because of this cane.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.404
So put on a white coat
like the rest of us.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.447
I don't want them to think
I'm a doctor.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.574
You see where the administration

03:19.700 --> 03:20.950
might have a problem
with that attitude?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.869
People don't want a sick doctor.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.036
That's fair enough.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.788
I don't like healthy patients.

03:25.914 --> 03:26.998
The 29-year-old female...

03:27.124 --> 03:30.001
The one who can't talk?
I like that part.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.878
She's my cousin.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.131
And your cousin doesn't like
the diagnosis.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.592
I wouldn't either. Brain tumor.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.343
She's going to die. Boring.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.890
No wonder you're
such a renowned diagnostician.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.225
You don't need to actually know
anything to figure out what's wrong.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.393
You're the oncologist.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.604
I'm just a lowly
infectious disease guy.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.689
Yes. Just a simple country doctor.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.774
Brain tumors at her age
are highly unlikely.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.901
She's 29.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.485
Whatever she's got
is highly unlikely.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.738
The protein markers for the three most
prevalent brain cancers

03:58.864 --> 03:59.864
came up negative.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.198
That's an HMO lab.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.701
Might as well have sent it to a high
school kid with a chemistry set.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.578
No family history.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.705
I thought your uncle died of cancer.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.582
Other side. No environmental factors.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.708
That you know of.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.501
And she's not responding
to radiation treatment.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.212
None of which is
even close to dispositive.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.798
All it does is raise one question.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.468
Your cousin goes to an HMO?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.886
Come on.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.804
Why leave all the fun
for the coroner?

04:23.931 --> 04:27.642
What's the point of putting together a
team if you're not gonna use them?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.853
You've got three overqualified doctors
working for you,

04:30.979 --> 04:32.146
getting bored.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.293
It's a lesion.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.255
And the big green thing

05:39.381 --> 05:41.632
in the middle of the bigger
blue thing on a map

05:41.758 --> 05:43.592
is an island.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.428
I was hoping for something
a bit more creative.

05:45.554 --> 05:49.598
Shouldn't we be speaking to the patient
before we start diagnosing?

05:49.725 --> 05:50.933
- Is she a doctor?
- No, but...

05:51.059 --> 05:52.727
Everybody lies.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.687
Dr. House doesn't like
dealing with patients.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.981
Isn't treating patients
why we became doctors?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.650
No. Treating illnesses is
why we became doctors.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.695
Treating patients is what makes
most doctors miserable.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.240
So you're trying to eliminate the
humanity from the practice of medicine?

06:06.366 --> 06:10.161
If we don't talk to them, they can't
lie to us, and we can't lie to them.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.079
Humanity's overrated.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.706
I don't think it's a tumor.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.458
First-year medical school,
if you hear hoofbeats,

06:15.584 --> 06:16.959
you think horses, not zebras.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.837
Are you in first-year medical school?

06:20.547 --> 06:23.382
No. First of all,
there's nothing on the CAT scan.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.884
Second of all, if this is a horse,

06:25.010 --> 06:27.970
then her kindly family doctor in
Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis,

06:28.096 --> 06:30.639
and it never gets near this office.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.016
Differential diagnosis, people.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.226
If it's not a tumor,
what are the suspects?

06:34.352 --> 06:36.312
Why couldn't she talk?

06:36.438 --> 06:39.315
Aneurysm, stroke
or some other ischemic syndrome.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.608
Get her a contrast MRI.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.068
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

06:42.194 --> 06:43.235
Mad cow?

06:43.361 --> 06:44.320
Mad zebra.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.946
Wernicke's encephalopathy.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.115
No. Blood thiamine level was normal.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.452
The lab in Trenton
could have screwed up the blood tests.

06:51.578 --> 06:55.706
I assume it's a corollary
if people lie that people screw up.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.541
Redraw the blood tests

06:57.667 --> 07:00.002
and get her scheduled
for that contrast MRI. ASAP.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.630
Let's find out what kind of zebra we're
treating here.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.727
Radiology,
please call the page.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.646
Radiology, please call the page.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.321
I was expecting you in my office
20 minutes ago.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.697
Really? Well, that's odd,

07:28.824 --> 07:30.616
because I had no intention of being in
your office 20 minutes ago.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.076
You think we have nothing
to talk about?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.328
No. I just can't think of anything I'd
be interested in.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.454
I sign your paychecks.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.039
I have tenure.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.418
Are you gonna grab my cane now,
stop me from leaving?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.420
That would be juvenile.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.094
I can still fire you
if you're not doing your job.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.303
I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.722
Your billings
are practically nonexistent.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.933
- Rough year.
- You ignore requests for consults.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.184
I call back. Sometimes I misdial.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.728
You're six years behind
on your obligations to the clinic.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.731
See? I was right.
This doesn't interest me.

08:02.858 --> 08:06.193
Six years times three weeks,
you owe me better than four months.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.362
It's 5:00. I'm going home.

08:09.865 --> 08:10.948
To what?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.242
Nice.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.831
Look, Dr. House,
the only reason why I don't fire you

08:18.957 --> 08:21.750
is because your reputation is still
worth something to this hospital.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.502
Excellent.
We have a point of agreement.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.712
You're not gonna fire me.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.464
Your reputation won't last
if you don't do your job.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.842
The clinic is part of your job.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.218
I want you to do your job.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.345
But, as the philosopher Jagger
once said,

08:33.471 --> 08:36.056
"You can't always get what you want."

08:42.898 --> 08:45.774
You're not my doctor.
Are you Dr. House?

08:45.901 --> 08:47.818
Thankfully, no. I'm Dr. Chase.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.945
Dr. House is the head of
Diagnostic Medicine.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.866
He's very busy, but he has taken
a keen interest in your case.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.414
We inject gadolinium
into a vein.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.208
It distributes itself
throughout your brain

09:02.334 --> 09:03.834
and acts as a contrast material

09:03.960 --> 09:06.420
for the magnetic resonance imager.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.715
Basically, whatever's in your head
lights up like a Christmas tree.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.300
It might make you feel
a little light-headed.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.426
Dr. Cameron.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.804
I'm sorry. I have to stop you.
There is a problem.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.892
You pulled my authorization!

09:20.018 --> 09:21.435
Yes. Why are you yelling?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.771
No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.814
You also can't make
long-distance phone calls.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.775
If you're going to fire me,
have the guts to face me.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.902
Or photocopies. You're still yelling.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.072
I'm angry!
You're risking a patient's life.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.698
I assume those are
two separate points.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.075
You showed me disrespect.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.452
You embarrassed me. And as long as
I work here, you have no legal...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.162
Is the yelling designed to scare me?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.874
Because I'm not sure what it is
I'm supposed to be scared of.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.417
More yelling?

09:45.543 --> 09:47.086
That's not scary.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.671
That you're going to hurt me?
That's scary.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.091
But I'm pretty sure I can outrun you.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.511
Oh, I looked into that philosopher you
quoted. Jagger.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.013
And you're right,
you can't always get what you want.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.268
But as it turns out, "If you try
sometimes, you get what you need."

10:03.687 --> 10:07.147
So, because you want me
to treat patients,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.525
you're not letting me treat patients?

10:09.651 --> 10:11.694
I need you to do your job.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.830
Do the MRI. She folded.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.585
I've got to do four hours a week
in this clinic

10:28.712 --> 10:31.588
until I make up the time I've missed.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.135
2054. I'll be caught up in 2054.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.930
You better love this cousin
a whole lot.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.718
All right, Rebecca, I know you may feel
a little claustrophobic in there,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.054
but we need you to remain still.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.766
Okay, we're going to begin.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.486
I don't feel so good.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.905
It's all right.
Just try to relax.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.331
Rebecca?

11:49.334 --> 11:50.542
Rebecca?

12:00.261 --> 12:01.553
Rebecca?

12:03.348 --> 12:04.348
Get her out of there.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.432
She probably fell asleep.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.476
She's exhausted. She was claustrophobic
30 seconds ago.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.727
She's not sleeping.
We gotta get her out of there.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.853
It'll just be another minute.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.480
If she's having an allergic reaction to
the gadolinium,

12:11.606 --> 12:12.940
she'll be dead in two minutes.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.654
- Hold her neck.
- All right.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.364
Oh, she's ashen.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.075
She's not breathing. Epi.5.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.411
Come on.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.830
I can't ventilate.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.543
Too much edema.
Where's the surgical airway kit?

12:32.669 --> 12:33.961
Yeah. Coming.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.541
Good call.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.647
We'll get that tube out of
your throat later today.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.025
Just get some rest for now, okay?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.448
Told you. You can't trust people.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.158
She probably knew
she was allergic to gadolinium.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.744
Figured it was an easy way to get
someone to cut a hole in her throat.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.370
Can't get a picture.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.830
Gonna have to get a thousand words.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.792
You actually want me to talk to
the patient, get a history?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.462
We need to know if there's some genetic
or environmental cause

13:58.588 --> 14:00.881
that's triggering
an inflammatory response.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.883
I thought everybody lied.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.637
Truth begins in lies. Think about it.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.767
That doesn't mean anything, does it?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.731
12:52 p.m.
Dr. House checks in.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.941
Please write that down.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.734
Do you have cable TV here somewhere?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.027
General Hospital
starts in eight minutes.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.196
No TV, but we've got patients.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.406
Can't you give out the aspirin
yourself? I'll do paperwork.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.700
I made sure your first case
was an interesting one.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.869
Cough just won't go away?
Runny nose looks a funny color?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.163
Patient admitted complaining of
back spasms.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.831
Oh? I think I read about
something like that

14:34.958 --> 14:35.958
in 'The New England
Journal of Medicine'.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.376
Patient is orange.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.502
The color?

14:38.628 --> 14:39.586
No, the fruit.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.879
You mean yellow. It's jaundice.

14:41.005 --> 14:41.964
I mean orange.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.216
- Well, how orange? It's probably...
- Exam Room 1.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.718
Dr. Kahn,
you're needed in Pediatrics.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.764
I was playing golf
and my cleats got stuck.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.016
It hurt a little, but I kept playing.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.602
The next morning,
I could barely stand up.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.773
Well, you're smiling, so I take it that
means this isn't serious.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.818
What's that? What are you doing?

15:02.944 --> 15:03.986
Painkillers.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.154
Oh, for you. For your leg.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.823
No, 'cause they're yummy.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.909
You want one?
Make your back feel better.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.330
Unfortunately,
you have a deeper problem.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.333
Your wife is having an affair.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.877
- What?
- You're orange, you moron.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.588
It's one thing for you not to notice,

15:22.714 --> 15:23.797
but if your wife hasn't picked up
on the fact

15:23.923 --> 15:26.842
that her husband has changed colors,
she's just not paying attention.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.844
By the way, do you consume
just a ridiculous amount

15:28.970 --> 15:30.971
of carrots and megadose vitamins?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.015
Carrots turn you yellow,
the niacin turns you red.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.975
Find some finger paint and do the math.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.935
And get a good lawyer.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.317
Deep breath.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.985
It's cold.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.196
Has he been using his inhaler?

15:48.323 --> 15:51.658
Not in the past few days. He's only 10.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.746
I worry about children taking such
strong medicine so frequently.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.955
What happened to your leg?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.749
Your doctor probably
was concerned

15:58.875 --> 16:00.375
about the strength of
the medicine, too.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.879
She probably weighed that danger
against the danger of not breathing.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.506
Oxygen is so important during
those prepubescent years,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.300
don't you think?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.218
Okay, I'm gonna assume that
nobody has ever told you

16:10.345 --> 16:11.386
what asthma is.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.264
Or if they have,
you had other things on your mind.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.434
A stimulant triggers cells
in your child's airways

16:17.560 --> 16:18.644
to release substances

16:18.770 --> 16:21.313
that inflame the air passages
and cause them to contract.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.775
Mucus production increases,
the cell lining starts to shed.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.610
But the steroids...

16:27.236 --> 16:30.906
The steroids stop the inflammation.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.534
The more often this happens...

16:34.911 --> 16:37.079
What?
The more often this happens, what?

16:37.205 --> 16:40.957
Forget it. If you don't trust
steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.419
My mother passed away
four years ago.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.879
She had a heart attack,

16:45.963 --> 16:49.257
and my father broke his back
doing construction...

16:51.844 --> 16:54.429
It's House. It's urgent. I'm sorry.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.977
You couldn't have knocked?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.814
Steroids. Give her steroids.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.273
High doses of prednisone.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.702
You're looking for support for
a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.787
Inflammation of blood vessels
in the brain is awfully rare,

17:18.913 --> 17:20.080
especially for someone her age.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.957
So is a tumor.
Her sed rate is elevated.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.041
Mildly.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.252
That could mean anything. Or nothing.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.755
Yeah, I know. I have no reason
to think that it's vasculitis.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.340
Except that it could be.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.633
If the blood vessels are inflamed,

17:31.759 --> 17:33.051
that's gonna look exactly
like what we saw

17:33.177 --> 17:34.428
on the MRI from Trenton County,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.638
and the pressure is gonna cause
neurological symptoms.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.056
We can't diagnose that
without a biopsy.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.182
Yes, we can.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.559
We treat it.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.852
If she gets better,
we know we're right.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.937
And if we're wrong?

17:44.021 --> 17:45.522
Then we learn something else.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.570
Why steroids?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.780
Just part of your treatment.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.407
You haven't had many visitors.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.659
- No boyfriend?
- Three dates.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.079
I wouldn't have stood by him
if he were vomiting all day.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.166
What about work?
You must have friends from work.

18:04.292 --> 18:07.377
Pretty much everybody I like
is five years old.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.007
The nurse said
you're stopping my radiation.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.760
We're just trying
some alternative medication.

18:14.886 --> 18:15.969
So where's your family from then?

18:16.053 --> 18:19.014
Steroids aren't
an alternative to radiation.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.433
The tests weren't really conclusive.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.769
We're treating you for vasculitis.

18:23.895 --> 18:27.063
It's the inflammation of
blood vessels in the brain.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.024
It's not a tumor?

18:30.026 --> 18:32.027
I don't have a tumor?

18:34.989 --> 18:38.366
Hey, you should have told her
the truth. It's a long-shot guess.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.993
Thank you. If House is right, no harm.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.871
If he's wrong, I've given a dying woman
a couple days' hope.

18:42.997 --> 18:43.830
False hope.

18:43.956 --> 18:48.084
If there was any other type available,
I would have given her that.

18:55.927 --> 18:58.512
Why are you smelling Billy's pants?

18:58.971 --> 18:59.805
I'm not.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.097
Looked like you were.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.641
I was smelling the floor.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.892
Oh.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.977
Do you have any pets in this class?

19:06.103 --> 19:10.273
No. But we used to have a gerbil,
but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.858
Careless.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.527
Do you need to smell it?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.654
No. I'm smelling for mold.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.866
- I don't need to smell it.
- You could smell our parrot.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.577
You said you didn't have any pets
in this class.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.079
A parrot is a bird.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.455
Listen, Jax is not the father...

19:25.581 --> 19:28.583
Parrots are
the primary source of psittacosis.

19:29.001 --> 19:29.793
It's not the parrot.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.212
And psittacosis can lead to

19:32.338 --> 19:34.756
nerve problems
and neurological complications.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.842
- How many kids were in the class?
- 20.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.051
How many are home sick?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.219
None, but...

19:39.345 --> 19:41.137
None. But you figured that
five-year-olds

19:41.264 --> 19:44.850
are more serious about bird hygiene
than their teacher?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.309
Have you been through her home?

19:46.435 --> 19:47.686
She lives in Trenton.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.730
I can go up to her room tomorrow
morning, ask her for the key.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.858
Would the police call for permission

19:52.984 --> 19:54.818
before dropping by
to check out a crime scene?

19:54.944 --> 19:55.902
It's not a crime scene.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.864
As far as I know, she's running
a meth lab out of her basement.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.156
She's a kindergarten teacher.

20:00.283 --> 20:04.369
And if I were a kindergarten student
I would trust her implicitly.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.623
Okay. I'll give you a "for instance."

20:08.749 --> 20:13.336
The lady back there who made
your egg salad sandwich,

20:13.462 --> 20:16.089
her eyes look glassy.
Did you notice that?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.092
Now, hospital policy is to stay home
if you're sick.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.760
But if you're making $8.00 an hour,

20:20.887 --> 20:23.597
then you kind of need
the $8.00 an hour, right?

20:23.723 --> 20:24.973
And the sign in the bathroom says

20:25.099 --> 20:27.434
that employees must wash
after using the facilities,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.312
but I figure that somebody
who wipes snot on a sleeve

20:30.438 --> 20:33.523
isn't hyper-concerned
about sanitary conditions.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.651
So what do you think,
should I trust her?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.988
I want you to check the patient's home
for contaminants, garbage, medication.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.990
I can't just break into
someone's house.

20:42.116 --> 20:45.160
Isn't that how you got into
the Felkers' home?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.833
Yeah, I know.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.126
Court records are sealed.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.837
You were 16. It was a stupid mistake.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.590
But your old gym teacher
has a big mouth.

20:58.716 --> 20:59.841
Should write a thank-you note.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.301
I should thank him?

21:01.427 --> 21:02.594
Well...

21:03.971 --> 21:07.140
I needed somebody around here
with street smarts.

21:09.352 --> 21:13.188
Okay? Who knows when they're being
conned, knows how to con.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.898
I should sue you.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.859
Pretty sure you can't sue somebody
for wrongful hiring.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.153
But I'm pretty sure I can sue
if you fire me

21:20.279 --> 21:22.864
for not breaking
into some lady's house.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.838
Doing research.
People are fascinating, aren't they?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.424
Why are you giving Adler steroids?

21:41.550 --> 21:42.842
Because she's my patient.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.803
That's what you do with patients,
you give them medicine.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.846
You don't prescribe medicine
based on guesses.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.349
At least we don't
since Tuskegee and Mengele.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.310
You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.562
I'm stopping the treatment.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.443
She's my patient.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.945
It's my hospital.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.323
I did not get her sick.
She is not an experiment.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.867
I have a legitimate theory about
what's wrong with her.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.327
With no proof.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.537
There's never any proof.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.706
Five different doctors come up
with five different diagnoses

22:12.832 --> 22:13.873
based on the same evidence.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.167
You don't have any evidence.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.587
And nobody knows anything, huh?

22:19.714 --> 22:21.423
Then how is it you always think
you're right?

22:21.549 --> 22:25.093
I don't. I just find it hard to operate
on the opposite assumption.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.429
And why are you so afraid of
making a mistake?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.347
Because I'm a doctor.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.391
Because when we make mistakes,
people die.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.018
Oh, come on.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.316
People used to have more respect
for cripples, you know.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.570
They didn't really.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.825
So how you feeling?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.160
Much better, thanks.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.245
Are you Dr. House?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.621
I thought he was a he, but...

22:53.748 --> 22:54.914
No.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.710
Don't eat too much, too fast.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.337
Thank him for me.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.797
Right.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.771
Should I discontinue the treatment,
boss?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.314
You got lucky.

23:23.861 --> 23:24.944
Cool, huh?

23:27.656 --> 23:28.740
Okay, once again.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.828
Good.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.331
Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?

23:37.583 --> 23:41.086
Well, you might run into him
at the movies or on the bus.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.046
Is he a good man?

23:43.798 --> 23:46.132
He's a good doctor.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.761
Can you be one without the other?

23:49.887 --> 23:51.721
Don't you have to care about people?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.807
Caring is a good motivator.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.976
He's found something else.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.855
Feel this, both sides?

24:00.981 --> 24:04.400
Okay, squeeze. Harder. All right.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.779
He's your friend, huh?

24:08.906 --> 24:09.989
Yeah.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.408
Does he care about you?

24:13.077 --> 24:14.119
I think so.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.286
You don't know?

24:16.372 --> 24:19.290
As Dr. House likes to say,
"Everybody lies."

24:19.917 --> 24:23.336
It's not what people say.
It's what they do.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.633
Yeah. He cares about me.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.097
I can't see.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.061
I can't see.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.572
A little help in here!

25:05.296 --> 25:07.922
Your chest will be sore for a while.

25:08.299 --> 25:11.384
We needed to shock you
to get your heart going.

25:13.304 --> 25:18.183
Okay, can you arrange these
to tell a story?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.657
She couldn't put them
in order.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.869
Could the damage have been caused
by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?

25:37.995 --> 25:41.998
No. I gave her the same test five
minutes later. She did just fine.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.791
The altered mental status is
intermittent,

25:43.918 --> 25:45.585
just like the verbal skills.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.669
So what now?

25:46.795 --> 25:50.423
Given the latest symptoms, it's clearly
growing deeper into the brain stem.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.425
Soon, she won't be able to walk.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.093
She'll go blind permanently,

25:54.220 --> 25:56.679
and then the respiratory center
will fail.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.847
How long do we have?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.766
If it's a tumor,
we're talking a month or two.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.392
If it's infectious, a few weeks.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.812
If it's vascular,
that'll probably be fastest of all.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.147
Maybe a week.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.608
We're gonna stop all treatment.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.611
I still think it's a tumor.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.029
I think we should go back
to the radiation.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.781
She didn't respond to
the radiation.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.742
Well, maybe we didn't see the effect
until after we started steroids.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.327
No, it's not a tumor.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.329
Those steroids did something.

26:21.455 --> 26:22.455
I just don't know what.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.833
So we're just gonna do nothing?
We're just gonna watch her die?

26:25.960 --> 26:28.169
Yeah, we're gonna watch her die.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.880
Specifically, we're gonna watch
how fast she's dying.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.758
You just told us, each diagnosis
has its own time frame.

26:33.884 --> 26:37.762
When we see how fast it's killing her,
we'll know what it is.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.431
And by then, maybe there's nothing
we can do about it.

26:40.557 --> 26:45.061
There's got to be something we can do.
Something better than watching her die.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.564
Well, I got nothing. How about you?

26:53.737 --> 26:54.821
Bastard.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.031
Oh, Cameron.
I need you for a couple of hours.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.157
What's up?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.534
When you break into someone's house,

26:59.660 --> 27:01.411
it's always better to have
a white chick with you.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.038
Adler's house?
Why don't we just ask her for her keys?

27:04.164 --> 27:06.916
For all we know, she could be running
a meth lab out of her basement.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.960
I'm tired a lot.

27:10.421 --> 27:14.507
Any other reason why you think you
might have chronic fatigue syndrome?

27:14.633 --> 27:15.842
It's kind of the definition, isn't it?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.552
It's kind of the definition
of getting older.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.847
I had a couple headaches last month,
a mild fever.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.225
Sometimes I can't sleep,
and I have trouble concentrating.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.729
Apparently not while researching
this stuff on the Internet.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.857
I was thinking
it also might be fibromyalgia.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.777
Excellent diagnosis.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.821
Is there anything for that?

27:40.784 --> 27:43.411
You know, I think there just might be.

27:43.537 --> 27:46.331
I need 36 Vicodin
and change for a dollar.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.773
Exam Room 2.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.568
House doesn't believe in pretense.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.653
Figures life's too short
and too painful.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.989
So he just says what he thinks.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.909
Nothing interesting in the garbage.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.828
"I say what I think" is just
nother way of saying "I'm an asshole".

28:28.332 --> 28:31.584
Well, if you wanted to be judged
for your medical prowess only,

28:31.710 --> 28:33.836
maybe you shouldn't have broken into
someone's home.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.338
I was 16.

28:37.466 --> 28:40.301
Don't know about ticks,
but her dog's definitely got fleas.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.807
I managed to make it to 17
without a criminal record.

28:49.770 --> 28:53.856
Yeah? Well, you obviously
didn't grow up in my neighborhood.

28:54.775 --> 28:58.778
That's right. You stole a loaf of bread
to feed your starving family, right?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.446
You always eat during break-ins?

29:00.572 --> 29:04.492
Am I supposed to respect their food
more than I respect their DVD players?

29:04.618 --> 29:06.244
- You want some?
- No.

29:06.370 --> 29:07.745
You gonna go hungry until she dies?

29:07.871 --> 29:09.580
- No.
- You know what?

29:09.706 --> 29:12.625
After centuries of slavery,
decades of civil rights marches,

29:12.751 --> 29:15.378
and, more significantly,
living like a monk,

29:15.504 --> 29:19.590
never getting less than a 4.0 GPA,
you don't think it's kind of disgusting

29:19.716 --> 29:23.761
I get one of the top jobs in the
country because I'm a delinquent?

29:24.096 --> 29:26.848
We'll eat,
then we'll tear up the carpet.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.727
- You went to Hopkins, right?
- Yeah.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.021
So you went to a better school
than I did.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.149
You got better grades than I did.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.818
So how did you get the job?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.862
You stab a guy in a bar fight?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.122
Nothing.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.665
It's not a tumor.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.292
She's getting worse too fast.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.710
She can't stand up.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.378
No toxins? No medications?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.422
Nothing that would explain
these symptoms.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.132
Family history of
neurological problems?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.676
Not that I could tell
from her underwear drawer.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.053
You said "nothing that would explain
these symptoms."

30:06.180 --> 30:09.765
What did you find
that doesn't explain these symptoms?

30:10.684 --> 30:14.937
Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat
this patient under false pretenses.

30:15.189 --> 30:17.064
Adler's not his cousin.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.775
That's ridiculous. You can ask her
yourself. Can we get back...

30:19.902 --> 30:22.069
- She's not Jewish.
- Rachel Adler's not Jewish?

30:22.196 --> 30:23.613
I had ham at her apartment.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.658
Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews
have non-Jewish relatives,

30:27.784 --> 30:29.911
and most of us don't keep kosher.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.496
I can see getting through high school

30:31.622 --> 30:33.706
without learning a thing about Jews,
but medical school?

30:33.832 --> 30:37.168
Okay, maybe she's Jewish,
but she's definitely not your cousin.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.879
Really? This guy is...

30:40.005 --> 30:41.464
You don't even know
her name.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.425
You called her Rachel.
Her name is Rebecca.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.802
Yes. Yes, her name is Rebecca.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.805
I call her Rachel.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.766
You idiot!

30:51.892 --> 30:53.726
Listen, he's...

30:53.852 --> 30:55.853
Not you. Him.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.271
You said you didn't find anything.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.564
Everything I found was in my...

30:58.690 --> 30:59.815
You found ham.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.984
So?

31:02.110 --> 31:03.903
Where there's ham, there's pork.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.322
Where there's pork,
there's neurocysticercosis.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.573
Tapeworm?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.824
You think she's got a worm
in her brain?

31:08.951 --> 31:09.909
It fits.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.203
Could have been living there for years.
Never occurred to me that...

31:12.329 --> 31:13.538
Millions of people eat ham every day.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.831
It's quite a leap to think
that's she's got a tapeworm.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.167
Okay, Mr. Neurologist,

31:18.293 --> 31:21.587
what happens when you give steroids
to a person who has a tapeworm?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.924
They get a little better,
and then they get worse.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.845
Just like Rebecca Adler did.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.276
In a typical case,
if you don't cook pork well enough,

31:43.402 --> 31:46.195
you digest live tapeworm larvae.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.864
They've got these little hooks,

31:48.991 --> 31:52.034
they grab onto your bowel, they live,
they grow up, they reproduce.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.578
Reproduce?

31:53.704 --> 31:55.913
There's only one lesion,
and it's nowhere near her bowel.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.749
That's because
this is not a typical case.

31:58.875 --> 32:02.753
Tapeworm can produce
20,000 to 30,000 eggs a day.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.713
Guess where they go?

32:03.839 --> 32:04.922
Out.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.799
Not all of them.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.967
Unlike the larvae,

32:08.093 --> 32:10.803
the egg can pass right through the
walls of the intestines

32:10.929 --> 32:12.179
into the bloodstream.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.764
And where does the bloodstream go?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.349
Everywhere.

32:15.809 --> 32:19.604
As long as it's healthy, the immune
system doesn't even know it's there.

32:19.730 --> 32:20.771
The worm builds a wall,

32:20.897 --> 32:23.274
uses secretions to shut down
the body's immune response

32:23.400 --> 32:25.026
and control fluid flow.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.819
It's really very beautiful.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.822
As long as it's healthy.
So what do we do?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.366
Call a vet, nurse the little guy back
to health?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.910
It's too late for that. It's dying.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.872
And as it dies,
this parasite loses the ability

32:37.998 --> 32:40.041
to control the host's defenses.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.710
The immune system wakes up,
attacks the worm

32:42.836 --> 32:44.045
and everything starts to swell.

32:44.171 --> 32:47.089
And that is very bad for the brain.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.967
It could still be
a hundred other things.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.178
The eosinophil count was normal.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.263
It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.389
Proving nothing.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.516
No, no, no, no. It...

32:57.643 --> 32:59.393
Don't you see? It fits. It's perfect.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.519
It explains everything.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.687
But it proves nothing.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.022
I can prove it by treating it.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.774
No, you can't.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.986
I was just with her.
She doesn't want any more treatments.

33:09.112 --> 33:13.324
She doesn't want any more experiments.
She wants to go home and die.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.848
Would you excuse us, please?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.064
I'm Dr. House.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.983
It's good to meet you.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.030
You're being an idiot.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.330
You have a tapeworm in your brain.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.792
It's not pleasant,
but if we don't do anything,

34:04.918 --> 34:06.085
you'll be dead by the weekend.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.629
Have you actually seen the worm?

34:08.922 --> 34:11.674
When you're all better,
I'll show you my diplomas.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.510
You were sure I had vasculitis, too.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.888
Now I can't walk
and I'm wearing a diaper.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.765
What's this treatment gonna do for me?

34:19.891 --> 34:23.144
I'm not talking about a treatment.
I'm talking about a cure.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.272
But because I might be wrong,
you want to die.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.359
What made you a cripple?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.322
I had an infarction.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.615
A heart attack?

34:37.784 --> 34:39.744
It's what happens
when blood flow is obstructed.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.996
If it's in the heart,
it's a heart attack.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.415
If it's in the lungs,
it's a pulmonary embolism.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.666
If it's in the brain, it's a stroke.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.418
I had it in my thigh muscles.

34:47.544 --> 34:48.711
Wasn't there something they could do?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.671
There was plenty they could do,

34:50.797 --> 34:53.007
if they'd made the right diagnosis.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.426
But the only symptom was pain.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.764
Not many people get to experience
muscle death.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.807
Did you think you were dying?

35:01.933 --> 35:03.851
I hoped I was dying.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.773
So you hide in your office,
refuse to see patients,

35:08.899 --> 35:11.942
because you don't like the way
people look at you.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.402
You feel cheated by life,

35:13.528 --> 35:16.489
so now you're gonna get even
with the world.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.908
But you want me to fight this.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.743
Why?

35:21.870 --> 35:25.080
What makes you think
I'm so much better than you?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.750
What?
You're scared you'll turn into me?

35:27.876 --> 35:30.252
I just want to die
with a little dignity.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.213
There's no such thing.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.298
Our bodies break down.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.424
Sometimes when we're 90.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.634
Sometimes before we're even born.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.887
But it always happens,
and there's never any dignity in it.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.681
I don't care if you can walk,
see, wipe your own ass.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.767
It's always ugly. Always.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.899
We can live with dignity.
We can't die with it.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.877
No treatment.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.923
Maybe we can get a court order,
override her wishes,

36:16.049 --> 36:18.717
claim she doesn't have the capacity
to make this decision.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.885
But she does.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.720
But we could claim
that the illness

36:21.847 --> 36:23.597
made her mentally incompetent, right?

36:23.723 --> 36:25.057
A pretty common result.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.642
That didn't happen here.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.102
He's not gonna do it.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.354
She's not just a file to him anymore.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.064
He respects her.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.776
So because you respect her,
you're going to let her die?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.780
I solved the case. My work is done.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.368
Patients always want proof.

36:44.786 --> 36:45.995
We're not making cars here.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.122
We don't give guarantees.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.168
I think we can prove it's a worm.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.046
It's noninvasive. It's safe.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.798
I'm not completely sure, but...

36:57.924 --> 36:59.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's the damn idea?

36:59.926 --> 37:02.094
Have you ever seen a worm
under an X-ray?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.222
A regular, old, no-contrast,
hundred-year-old-technology X-ray?

37:05.348 --> 37:09.018
They light up like shotgun pellets,
just like on a contrast MRI.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.853
Which is the same thing as a CT scan,

37:10.979 --> 37:12.438
which we did, which proved nothing.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.274
The worm's cyst is the same density
as the cerebrospinal fluid.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.235
We're not gonna see anything
in her head.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.778
But Chase is right.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.030
He's right. We should X-ray her.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.323
But we don't X-ray her brain.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.199
We X-ray her leg.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.243
Worms love thigh muscle.

37:26.369 --> 37:29.246
If she's got one in her head,
I guarantee you there's one in her leg.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.179
Hold still, Rebecca.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.688
This here

37:56.399 --> 37:57.942
is a worm larva.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.611
So, if it's in my leg,
it's in my brain?

38:00.737 --> 38:03.238
Are you looking for a guarantee?

38:03.490 --> 38:06.492
It's there.
Probably been there 6 to 10 years.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.202
Do I have more?

38:08.328 --> 38:09.578
Probably.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.165
It's good news.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.708
What do we do now?

38:14.834 --> 38:16.085
Now we get you better.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.255
Albendazole.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.677
- Two pills?
- Yeah.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.471
Every day, for at least a month,
with a meal.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.181
- Two pills?
- Yeah.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.017
Possible side effects
include abdominal pain,

38:32.143 --> 38:36.146
nausea, headaches, dizziness,
fever and hair loss.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.023
We'll probably make you
keep taking the pills

38:38.149 --> 38:41.318
even if you get every one of those.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.504
Why did you hire me?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.173
Does it matter?

39:03.299 --> 39:05.259
Kind of hard to work for a guy
who doesn't respect you.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.760
- Why?
- Is that rhetorical?

39:06.886 --> 39:10.764
No. It just seems that way 'cause
you can't think of an answer.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.642
Does it make a difference what I think?

39:13.768 --> 39:17.521
I'm a jerk. The only thing that matters
is what you think.

39:17.647 --> 39:18.689
Can you do the job?

39:18.815 --> 39:20.983
You hired a black guy
because he had a juvenile record.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.861
No. It wasn't a racial thing.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.696
I didn't see a black guy.

39:25.822 --> 39:29.783
I just saw a doctor
with a juvenile record.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.746
I hired Chase 'cause
his dad made a phone call.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.291
I hired you because
you are extremely pretty.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.419
You hired me to get into my pants?

39:40.545 --> 39:42.713
I can't believe that
that would shock you.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.798
It's also not what I said.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.676
No, I hired you because you look good.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.678
It's like having a nice piece of art
in the lobby.

39:49.804 --> 39:50.971
I was in the top of my class.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.181
But not the top.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.183
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.642
Yeah. You were a very good applicant.

39:55.769 --> 39:56.727
But not the best.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.812
Would that upset you? Really?

39:58.938 --> 40:01.273
To think that you were hired because of
some genetic gift of beauty

40:01.399 --> 40:03.108
instead of some genetic gift of
intelligence?

40:03.234 --> 40:05.444
I worked very hard to get where I am.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.488
But you didn't have to.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.866
People choose the paths
that gain them the greatest rewards

40:10.992 --> 40:14.620
for the least amount of effort. That's
a law of nature, and you defied it.

40:14.746 --> 40:15.996
That's why I hired you.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.457
You could have married rich.
You could have been a model.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.751
You could have just shown up
and people would have given you stuff.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.711
Lots of stuff.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.463
But you didn't.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.173
You worked
your stunning little ass off.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.633
Am I supposed to be flattered?

40:27.759 --> 40:30.594
Gorgeous women do not go
to medical school,

40:30.720 --> 40:34.056
unless they're as damaged as
they are beautiful.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.308
Were you abused by a family member?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.268
- No.
- Sexually assaulted?

40:38.394 --> 40:39.394
No!

40:40.230 --> 40:42.648
But you are damaged, aren't you?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.739
I have to go.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.744
I followed her.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.246
Oh.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.540
I couldn't stop thinking about what
that doctor said.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.333
I told you not to listen to him.
He's an idiot.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.918
I was orange!

41:03.711 --> 41:05.796
I don't want to know
what you found out.

41:05.922 --> 41:06.922
You don't care?

41:07.048 --> 41:08.757
I'm your doctor.

41:09.259 --> 41:12.553
You've been good to me and good
to this hospital. Of course I care.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.681
But I don't see how this conversation
can end well for me.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.641
Either your wife is having an affair,

41:17.767 --> 41:19.184
or she's not having an affair,

41:19.310 --> 41:22.104
and you have come here because
you rightly think I should fire him.

41:22.230 --> 41:25.149
But I can't.
Even if it costs me your money.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.403
The son of a bitch is
the best doctor we have.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.077
Feeling any better?

41:37.203 --> 41:39.037
I can't complain.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.123
As you know,
the hospital has certain rules.

41:41.249 --> 41:44.751
And as you also know,
we tend to ignore them.

41:44.878 --> 41:46.670
But I think this one's gonna be
a little obvious

41:46.796 --> 41:48.672
unless we get your help.

41:48.798 --> 41:51.633
If anyone asks,
you have 11 daughters and 5 sons.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.928
Hi! Look who's here!

41:55.763 --> 41:58.640
It's so good to see you guys.
I missed you.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.518
This is for me?

42:01.644 --> 42:03.228
It's beautiful.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.525
Oh, I love you guys.

42:09.277 --> 42:12.112
I wanted to thank Dr. House,
but he never visited again.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.740
He cured you. You didn't cure him.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.911
Okay, I want a hug and a kiss from
every single one of you!

42:19.037 --> 42:20.662
Get up here right now!

42:22.790 --> 42:24.750
There.

42:24.876 --> 42:25.959
Hold on.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.337
She's converted.

42:30.632 --> 42:32.883
You said she was your cousin.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.843
Why would you lie?

42:35.428 --> 42:37.638
It got you to take the case.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.724
You lied to a friend
to save a stranger.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.935
You don't think
that's kind of screwed up?

42:43.061 --> 42:44.978
You've never lied to me?

42:45.104 --> 42:46.897
I never lie.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.233
Oh, right.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.568
Why do we do this?

42:51.694 --> 42:52.819
Because we're doctors.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.364
If we make mistakes, people die.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.287
Dr. House? You have a patient.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.296
He says he needs a refill.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.634
Got change for a dollar?
