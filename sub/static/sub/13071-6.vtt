00:00.968 --> 00:02.736
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:02.770 --> 00:07.175
* Well, it happened,
it finally happened *

00:07.208 --> 00:11.045
* Laurel's got bugs
in her brain *

00:11.079 --> 00:15.116
* Guess I didn't see
this coming *

00:15.149 --> 00:18.519
* Isn't supposed to happen
to the main character *

00:18.552 --> 00:23.257
* I hope her head
does not explode *

00:23.291 --> 00:28.662
* Like other heads
exploded thrice before *

00:28.696 --> 00:32.066
* Abby's dead,
Stacie's infected *

00:32.100 --> 00:34.835
* Gareth's jealous
and rejected *

00:34.868 --> 00:37.738
* Mean old Anthony got
face-punched out the door *

00:37.771 --> 00:43.577
* There's no one left
to dry your tears *

00:43.611 --> 00:46.080
* Hide your heart

00:46.114 --> 00:49.183
* Protect your ears.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.221
(insects trilling)

00:56.124 --> 00:57.858
(gasps)

00:57.891 --> 00:59.727
Oh!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.762
Ow! Ow!

01:01.795 --> 01:03.831
No, no, no...

01:03.864 --> 01:06.434
No, no, no. (panting)

01:06.467 --> 01:08.169
(grunting)

01:08.202 --> 01:09.270
(screams)

01:09.303 --> 01:10.871
No, no!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.506
(screams)

01:12.540 --> 01:14.175
(gasps)

01:14.208 --> 01:16.610
(panting)

01:16.644 --> 01:20.848
(groaning)

01:20.881 --> 01:24.185
911, what's the exact location
of your emergency?

01:24.218 --> 01:25.886
857 Acker.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.588
House or apartment?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.323
Apartment 2.
(screaming)

01:29.357 --> 01:31.425
Are you all right, ma'am?

01:31.459 --> 01:32.726
I need...

01:32.760 --> 01:34.328
I need medical assistance.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.696
What's the nature
of your problem?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.398
Bugs crawled in my ear!

01:37.431 --> 01:38.532
I need help!

01:38.566 --> 01:39.367
(line beeps)

01:39.400 --> 01:41.335
Got one of those calls,
Ms. Mooser.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.304
Good, transfer
it my way.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.311
You have bugs
in your ear, ma'am?

01:50.344 --> 01:52.146
Yes! Yes.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.414
I need help. Please hurry.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.748
We're calling for an EMT
right now, ma'am.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.784
Please stay on the line.
Don't hang up.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.562
(grunting)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.300
(pounding on door)

02:12.333 --> 02:13.501
GUSTAV:
Laurel!

02:13.534 --> 02:14.602
Get the cherry blossoms out!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.204
The bugs are in the flowers!

02:19.407 --> 02:21.342
(pounding continues)
Laurel, wake up!

02:21.375 --> 02:22.676
It's the flowers!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.478
Oh!

02:24.512 --> 02:25.379
You got to get them out now!

02:28.216 --> 02:29.783
They're in.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.420
*

02:36.824 --> 02:38.892
You need to call 911.

02:38.926 --> 02:39.960
I called.
They're sending someone.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.195
It's there!

02:42.396 --> 02:44.798
Hey, uh, we need
someone here now.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.234
We have an emergency.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.635
Yes, sir, I understand.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.569
EMTs are on the way.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.537
(grunts)

02:49.570 --> 02:51.372
Well, how long?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.873
They're just busy
with other calls at the moment.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.375
45 minutes or so.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.445
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
What?

02:57.478 --> 02:58.646
Uh...
What did she say?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.713
No, don't worry.
We're fine.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.382
We're fine.
No, no, what did she--?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.885
(line beeps)

03:04.918 --> 03:05.919
(call waiting beeps)
Uh, hold on.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.355
It's, uh, it's
call waiting.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.556
Hello?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.657
GARETH:
Hello?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.991
Who is this?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.059
Gareth Ritter.
Who's this?

03:12.092 --> 03:14.428
Uh, Laurel doesn't have time
for this right now.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.330
She'll call you back later.
(Laurel screaming)

03:16.364 --> 03:17.498
What's going on?
LAUREL: Oh, God!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.566
Hey, what happened?

03:18.599 --> 03:19.567
Uh, nothing.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.602
We're all good here, bye.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.406
(meowing)

03:25.439 --> 03:26.407
(muffled laugh)

03:26.440 --> 03:27.408
LAUREL:
I can feel it

03:27.441 --> 03:28.742
in my mind.
Uh-huh.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.843
They're eating at my brain.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.812
Okay, okay.
Uh... look at me.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.013
Uh, just keep,
keep breathing.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.014
(exhales)

03:34.047 --> 03:35.816
What do you have memorized?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.518
What?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.819
Do you know
the periodic tables?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.521
Hydrogen, lithium,
sodium, potassium.
No.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.456
What are you--?
Seriously?

03:42.490 --> 03:43.424
Gustav!
Presidents.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.425
Do-do presidents.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.593
Okay, Washington,

03:45.626 --> 03:46.994
um, Jefferson...
(knocking)

03:47.027 --> 03:48.596
I got it!
Oh, good, the paramedics!

03:48.629 --> 03:50.364
You keep going.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.432
Um, Madison,

03:51.465 --> 03:52.933
Jackson...

03:52.966 --> 03:54.568
It's in the
cherry blossoms?

03:54.602 --> 03:57.305
Yes, but, uh,
she's got bugs in her--

03:57.338 --> 03:58.339
LAUREL:
Who is it?!

03:58.372 --> 03:59.540
Rochelle.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.375
911 is just
a few minutes away.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.010
Oh, my God, Laurel!

04:03.043 --> 04:04.011
Are you all right?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.446
Uh, she's
reciting presidents.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.580
Uh...
Jackson--

04:06.614 --> 04:07.348
Do you have any bacon?
Monroe.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.449
Okay, here we go.
No, no, no.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.450
It's all right.
Van Buren.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.518
I knew this.
I know this!

04:10.551 --> 04:11.885
ROCHELLE:
I know.
There's no bacon!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.387
Why don't you have any bacon?!

04:13.421 --> 04:14.755
Can you see anything?
No...

04:14.788 --> 04:16.590
Uh, here.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.592
What is that?
Uh...

04:18.626 --> 04:19.460
salami-- it's
all she had.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.329
Are you insane?!

04:21.362 --> 04:22.863
It draws out
the screwworms.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.432
Aah, I can feel it going.
I can feel it going.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.533
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't close your eyes.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.334
How many fingers?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.602
That's what I did
with your dad.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.905
And that's, that's
what I did with Oscar.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.342
I talked him through
the chess moves.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.644
Lateralization
of brain function.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.878
What about it?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.513
Left brain, right brain.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.782
Uh, we're going
about this all wrong.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.484
You don't, you don't,

04:43.517 --> 04:44.785
you don't battle it
with logic, you-- Stop!

04:44.818 --> 04:46.320
Stop!

04:46.354 --> 04:47.455
Stop thinking about presidents!

04:47.488 --> 04:49.590
Stop-stop thinking at all, uh...

04:49.623 --> 04:50.658
We've been
battling the bugs

04:50.691 --> 04:51.959
with the wrong
side of the brain.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.327
They went in
the left ear,

04:53.361 --> 04:54.495
so we have to attack
from the right.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.829
How do I stop
thinking?

04:55.863 --> 04:57.731
He's right. Music.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.899
(cheers)
Right

04:58.932 --> 05:00.468
brain functions.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.802
Non-verbal.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.405
Um, intuition,
art, music.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.806
Uh, feelings, movement.
Risk taking,

05:05.839 --> 05:07.074
passion-- Laurel?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.976
We need to spark
your intuitive brain.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.511
Your non-logical.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.912
Food, alcohol--
where is it?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.080
(gasps)
Oh no, wait.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.515
No. No, no, no, stop.
Don't think about

05:14.548 --> 05:15.483
where it is--
I'll find it.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.084
(loud rock music playing)

05:20.588 --> 05:23.557
* Itsy bitsy teeny weeny,
ah, ah *

05:23.591 --> 05:24.925
* Bikini, education...

05:24.958 --> 05:27.461
ROCHELLE:
I got it.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.762
Take a drink.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.763
From the bottle?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.599
Yeah, now, do it.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.100
* Down, down, baby...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.403
Okay, get up. Dance.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.571
* Sweet, sweet candy...

05:37.605 --> 05:39.607
What? I can't...
Yes.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.375
You can.
Come on, grab my arm.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.576
Here we go.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.777
Come on, take
another drink.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.846
* By the broken glass

05:45.879 --> 05:47.548
* Five dollar baggies
on the ground... *

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
This isn't gonna work.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.584
Does it still hurt?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.586
* Rising high above

05:52.620 --> 05:54.655
* Shimmy, shimmy ko-ko bop

05:54.688 --> 05:57.024
* Shimmy, shimmy rye

05:57.057 --> 05:59.793
* Shimmy, shimmy ko-ko bop,
shimmy, shimmy rye *

05:59.827 --> 06:02.863
* On this January Sunday

06:02.896 --> 06:05.766
* We watch
the airplanes fly away *

06:05.799 --> 06:09.570
* As they rise up
from the airport *

06:09.603 --> 06:12.940
* Above the Meadowland Highway

06:12.973 --> 06:16.577
* As we crash
through heaven's tollbooth *

06:16.610 --> 06:18.646
* In our fleeting
getaway car... *

06:18.679 --> 06:20.514
Oh, my...

06:20.548 --> 06:21.549
Are you throwing up?
No.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.716
They're moving.
Good.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.718
No, I don't think so.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.720
We need to be
more aggressive.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.188
Uh, what else
is right brain?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.957
(elephant bellows over TV)

06:29.990 --> 06:32.960
* Until we're looking down

06:32.993 --> 06:34.995
* Into this Freedom Park...
(knocking)

06:37.465 --> 06:38.566
(moaning over speakers)

06:38.599 --> 06:41.001
Hi.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.703
Is Laurel here?

06:42.736 --> 06:43.904
Oh, he's here.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.005
(laughing):
Of course.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.140
That makes so much sense.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.676
She's fine.
She'll call you later.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.978
Wait, wait, wait.
Um...

06:51.011 --> 06:53.146
Gareth, right?
Yeah.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.181
Why? What's wrong?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.716
Is Laurel
all right?

06:55.749 --> 06:59.720
* Sweet, sweet candy,
mama never let you go... *

07:01.922 --> 07:03.757
Bugs?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.759
You have met your match.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.061
* Ice cream soda
with a cherry on top... *

07:08.095 --> 07:09.663
No.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.898
She needs your help.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.466
* Walking down the street

07:12.500 --> 07:15.068
* I meant it, I said it, ooh,
I'm gonna get it *

07:15.102 --> 07:17.838
* I'm cool, I'm hot,
sock it to me *

07:17.871 --> 07:20.474
* In the stomach
three more times. *

07:20.508 --> 07:21.775
Laurel has

07:21.809 --> 07:22.943
a condition
where she needs

07:22.976 --> 07:24.745
a... burst

07:24.778 --> 07:26.647
of dopamine.
Excuse me?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.516
Hi.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.983
Hi.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.985
I just came to make sure
you're all right.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.153
LAUREL:
I am.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.488
I'm...

07:34.522 --> 07:36.023
Gah, I'm not supposed to think.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.691
You're not?
No, no.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.792
Why not?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.260
Uh, to explain
would be to think.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.862
And I'm not supposed to think.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.732
(chuckles)
Okay.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.167
Then, let's not think.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.839
Actually,

07:51.872 --> 07:53.674
I was thinking.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.776
And right in the middle
of a good dream,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.811
like all at once I wake up

07:57.845 --> 07:59.980
from something that keeps
knocking at my brain.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.116
Before I go insane,
I put a pillow to my head.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.953
And spring up in my bed,
screaming out the words I dread.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.756
* I think I love you...

08:08.789 --> 08:11.625
* I think I love you.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.661
What is this--
karaoke night?

08:13.694 --> 08:17.765
* This morning,
I woke up with a feeling *

08:17.798 --> 08:20.200
* I didn't know
how to deal with *

08:20.233 --> 08:23.737
* And so I just decided
to myself *

08:23.771 --> 08:26.206
(chuckles)
* I'd hide it
to myself *

08:26.239 --> 08:28.842
* And never
talk about it *

08:28.876 --> 08:32.646
* But didn't I go and shout it
when you walked into the room *

08:32.680 --> 08:34.848
* I think I love you

08:34.882 --> 08:35.883
* I think
I love you *

08:35.916 --> 08:36.917
You've been drinking?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.151
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.787
* I think I love you

08:39.820 --> 08:41.655
* So what am I so afraid of

08:41.689 --> 08:44.257
* I'm afraid
that I'm not sure of *

08:44.291 --> 08:46.860
* A love there
is no cure for *

08:46.894 --> 08:48.996
Oh, we're dancing now?
Hell yeah.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.764
* I think I love you

08:50.798 --> 08:54.602
* Isn't that
what life is made of *

08:54.635 --> 08:56.870
* Though it worries me to say

08:56.904 --> 09:00.140
* That I never
felt this way... *

09:00.173 --> 09:02.209
What are we doing here?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.778
Getting the bugs
out of my head.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.215
Sure.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.051
* I don't know
what I'm up against... *

09:11.084 --> 09:12.085
Are you sure you
want to do this?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.887
Yes.
Yeah?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.856
Now.
Now?

09:15.889 --> 09:16.924
Yes.
Now, like, right now.

09:16.957 --> 09:17.925
Uh-huh.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.627
* I think I love you

09:19.660 --> 09:21.061
* So what am I afraid of

09:21.094 --> 09:23.163
* I'm afraid
that I'm not sure of *

09:23.196 --> 09:25.866
* A love there
is no cure for *

09:25.899 --> 09:27.000
You hungry?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.736
Don't stop.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.038
* I think I love you

09:31.071 --> 09:33.373
* Isn't that
what life is made of *

09:33.406 --> 09:35.909
* So it worries me to say

09:35.943 --> 09:39.246
* I never felt this way...

09:42.783 --> 09:46.319
Have you noticed in horror
movies black people die first?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.623
(moans)
Faster.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.891
Faster?
Yeah.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
No, there, there.
Yeah, okay.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.095
Uh, if you want me
to kiss your breasts?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.664
No! Shh!

09:56.697 --> 09:57.765
There, yeah.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.899
That's good.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.801
There, yeah, more!

10:00.834 --> 10:01.935
There!
It's working.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.071
Okay, good.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.739
Can I just get my arm...?
No!

10:05.773 --> 10:06.907
Not yet.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.776
* Do you think you love me

10:08.809 --> 10:10.811
* I think I love you

10:10.844 --> 10:12.946
* I think
I love you *

10:12.980 --> 10:16.116
* I think I love you

10:16.149 --> 10:17.951
* I think
I love you... *

10:17.985 --> 10:20.253
(moaning)

10:20.287 --> 10:21.789
* I think I love you

10:21.822 --> 10:23.791
(panting)

10:23.824 --> 10:25.392
* I think I love you...

10:25.425 --> 10:27.828
(snoring)

10:32.165 --> 10:34.167
(gasping)

10:48.215 --> 10:50.984
I...

10:51.018 --> 10:52.652
What's up?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.356
Huh.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.227
(door closes)

11:04.832 --> 11:05.866
Laurel?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.835
You okay?

11:09.436 --> 11:10.871
They're gone.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.172
(sighs)

11:12.205 --> 11:14.041
(sighs)

11:14.074 --> 11:16.877
(chuckles)

11:16.910 --> 11:19.012
Got one.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.885
REPORTER:
We're half past the hour

11:24.918 --> 11:26.253
and focusing on
the CDC budget vote.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.421
Will the senate fund
this critical institution?

11:28.455 --> 11:31.759
RED:
Tax-and-spend?!
ELLA: Yes, we tax and spend.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.193
That's out damn job!

11:33.226 --> 11:34.594
You are trying to
create dys...
No, it's because
we're going broke.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.264
We can't pay for everyone.
This has nothing
to do with us going broke.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.899
We are not a country where you
can just give handouts...

11:38.932 --> 11:40.300
Read Paul Krugman.
Or look at Finland.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.969
We should be taxing the rich

11:42.002 --> 11:43.070
and redistributing the wealth.
RED:
Are you serious?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.872
Have you been to Finland?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.740
It's like an empty
parking lot with snow.
Okay, okay.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.141
Tell me!
AMARANT: Good, good.
Get it out here.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.910
But we go into
that committee hearing,

11:49.943 --> 11:52.445
I want a straight up vote
on refinancing the CDC.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.214
There is $438 million

11:54.247 --> 11:55.749
in pork in that bill!
Wow.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.851
One-third of the CDC budget.
LUKE: Yes,

11:57.885 --> 11:59.152
and $80 million of that pork

11:59.186 --> 12:00.420
is coming back
to your state, Red.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.056
It's why
you got reelected.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.291
You bring home
the money.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.893
So don't get all
hypocritical on us.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.160
Times are changing.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.762
I have e-mails...

12:08.796 --> 12:09.863
God, more e-mails.
(knocking at door)

12:09.897 --> 12:11.865
Gareth, bring me
the One Wayer e-mails.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.366
ELLA: E-mails, as if
they prove anything!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.302
They could all be coming
from one guy

12:15.335 --> 12:17.037
in his mother's basement.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.106
(indistinct shouting)

12:37.290 --> 12:38.992
(phone beeps)

12:39.026 --> 12:41.161
Hello?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.562
Hey. It's Rochelle.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.064
(sighs)

12:44.097 --> 12:45.098
Just seeing how you're doing.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.100
I'm good. Yeah, I guess.

12:47.134 --> 12:47.767
You guess?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.269
If you have
any hesitations,

12:49.302 --> 12:50.871
come in for a CAT scan.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.873
No, no, I'm good.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.374
No side effects.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.576
In fact, I was wondering
if the same thing might work

12:56.609 --> 12:58.045
on my friend Stacie.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.446
Using the right brain?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.882
It's worth a try.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.050
How would you do it?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.017
I don't know.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.018
I'm working on that.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.954
Did you examine the bug?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.588
We are doing that now.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.891
Good. Let's get together
with what we found out. Okay?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.359
Okay. Oh, hey, um...

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
did you talk
to Gareth afterwards?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.063
No.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.364
Not yet. Why?

13:17.397 --> 13:20.100
Did he see the... the bugs?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.468
I don't know.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.070
I can think of a dozen reasons

13:23.103 --> 13:24.471
why I'll never
hear from him again.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.074
Ever.
(chuckles) Call him.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.141
People can be understanding.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.310
Not after last night.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.879
Okay,

13:31.912 --> 13:33.146
I'll talk to you.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.381
Okay.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.361
Hey.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.130
How are you doing? It's Laurel.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.066
Good. How are you?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.134
Good.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.368
I was wondering if

13:55.402 --> 13:57.905
we could meet up
for drinks tonight.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.039
I'm okay, Laurel, you don't
have to worry about me.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.507
I'm not angry at you.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.176
No, no, it's not that.
It's, um,

14:03.210 --> 14:05.078
I have a scoop.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.313
For Roll Call.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.447
You do? What?

14:07.480 --> 14:08.916
I can't say over the phone.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.150
I wanted to slip it to a friend.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.218
Okay.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.353
What time?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.025
It still hasn't moved.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.460
It's like it's...

14:20.493 --> 14:22.129
waiting for us.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.135
What are you doing?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.470
Finding out its
chemical composition.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.141
Try the front appendage.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.981
You have a
spectrometer?
Yep.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.249
Okay...

14:56.163 --> 14:57.164
Rochelle...

14:57.197 --> 14:59.199
What?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.700
GUSTAV:
Look.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.203
Bugs don't do that.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.972
Do they?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.674
I've never seen it.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.343
Do you think these bugs
might be from...
Don't say it.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.079
What?
I don't know,
but don't say it.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.346
Outer...
Don't.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.614
I'm just...
Shh!

15:19.552 --> 15:21.188
(quick knock)
LUKE:
Ah.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.590
Here she is. Here's who
you want to see. My sister.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.258
Actually, Luke,
I was just heading out.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.626
No, because here's
a constituent

15:26.659 --> 15:27.961
who needs your help.
Mr. Brewster--

15:27.995 --> 15:28.962
BREWSTER:
Why can't you help me?

15:28.996 --> 15:30.130
I voted for you, not her.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.398
Hi, Mr. Brewster.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
So good to see you again.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.267
How may I help you?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.469
I have to ride three buses

15:36.503 --> 15:38.271
just to vote.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.207
And if you lose your transfer,
they make you pay again.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.109
This is about
your polling place?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.376
Yes. What do you think
I'm talking about?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.212
It used to be

15:45.245 --> 15:47.247
right across the street
at the fire station.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.716
Now I have to go
40 minutes away.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.285
Have you discussed this

15:52.319 --> 15:53.620
with your local representative?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.255
No, my census taker.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.990
She works in
the state house now.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.191
She said it
all came down

15:58.225 --> 16:00.127
from the Maryland senator.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.661
You guys are
my Maryland senator.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.697
Yes, but we...

16:04.731 --> 16:06.633
Did she possibly mean
Red Wheatus?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.235
I don't know.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.302
There's too many of you people

16:09.336 --> 16:10.537
to figure out which is which.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.072
Just don't give me

16:12.105 --> 16:13.306
the runaround, okay?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.276
I gotta take two buses
now to go home.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.378
You know that?
One bus to the museum,

16:18.411 --> 16:20.147
three buses to vote!

16:20.180 --> 16:22.182
*

16:31.258 --> 16:33.293
May I help you?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.764
Um, Laurel Healy

16:37.797 --> 16:39.732
for Gareth Ritter.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.201
Please.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.269
And what is this regarding?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.037
A constituent I have to help.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.273
Actually, no.
Just...

16:46.306 --> 16:48.241
just tell him I'm here.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.110
No, wait. Yes,

16:50.143 --> 16:51.778
it is work-related.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.381
Would you take a seat, please?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.322
Actually, just...
don't say that.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.490
Just say that I'm here and...

17:03.523 --> 17:05.192
This is not kale.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.259
I want kale!

17:06.293 --> 17:08.661
Sorry, Senator.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.164
I know you.
Healy, right?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.532
Yes, Senator.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.800
Come on in here.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.268
I want to
talk to you.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.372
Well, come on.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.214
So, you're the bleeding heart
Healy, huh?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.448
"Bleeding heart"?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.450
Yeah. The emotional one.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.319
The one who cares about...

17:32.352 --> 17:33.553
(fake sobs)
...poor veterans

17:33.586 --> 17:36.323
and their little
cute daughters.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.524
"Why is my daddy sick?"

17:37.557 --> 17:38.791
That's you, right?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.293
Not your brother.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.495
I don't know.
I think it's both of us.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.297
Why don't you go back to L.A.?

17:44.331 --> 17:45.798
Excuse me?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.300
Well, you don't
like it here.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.369
These aren't your people.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.272
And things are gonna get bad
very quickly.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.408
Why do you care?

17:55.442 --> 17:56.676
Because you're in my way.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.145
(chuckles)

17:59.746 --> 18:03.183
I work in constituent casework,
Senator.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.417
That's hardly in your way.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.553
Well, here's the thing, Lana...

18:06.586 --> 18:08.121
Laurel.
You've been
slinking around

18:08.155 --> 18:09.422
my chief of staff...
Really?

18:09.456 --> 18:10.657
...distracting him.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.125
He tell you that?
No, no.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.261
He doesn't know
what you're about.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.562
I do.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.763
And what am I about?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.665
Unpredictability.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.733
I know how
your brother will act.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.303
Strategists can read
other strategists.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.472
But you... One day,
you're emotional;

18:25.505 --> 18:27.840
the next, you're strategic;
the next, you're...

18:27.874 --> 18:30.610
having your woman time.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.811
My "woman time"?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.846
Go back to L.A.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.432
You don't drink anymore,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
do you, Senator?
Oh, I drink

18:54.801 --> 18:56.369
my kale-celery smoothies.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.537
You should try 'em.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.805
No alcohol?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.240
My body's a temple.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.408
Why do you drink?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.610
'Cause I like it. It's fun.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.678
There are other
ways to have fun.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.380
Joining other
like-minded people

19:07.414 --> 19:08.581
in completing
a mission...

19:08.615 --> 19:10.149
Sounds like a blast.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.520
What are these maps about?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.923
Uh, office work
product.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.226
It's not very smart of you
to let me see them.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.727
It won't matter.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.429
You're gonna lose.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.298
Then why do you care
if I'm in the way?

19:26.533 --> 19:27.967
(chuckles)

19:28.000 --> 19:29.636
You are a sly one.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.438
I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.472
(knocking at door)

19:32.505 --> 19:34.441
Senator, the...

19:34.474 --> 19:36.276
Ah, Gareth, buddy,
how are you?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.478
I think you know Lana. Yeah.
Laurel.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.879
She's here wanting to talk about

19:39.912 --> 19:42.382
my kale-celery smoothie intake.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.483
(chuckles)

19:44.817 --> 19:46.819
Well...

19:46.853 --> 19:49.522
I'll let you two talk.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.624
And we'll talk again.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.633
So.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.669
Um...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.704
So...

20:06.306 --> 20:07.307
I'm not here about last night.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.541
I'm here

20:08.575 --> 20:09.442
about gerrymandering.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.011
Your office is
coordinating gerrymandering

20:12.044 --> 20:13.846
with the Maryland State House.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.583
One of our constituents
complained.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.850
Okay...

20:20.453 --> 20:21.854
Let's back up.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.656
(exhales)

20:23.690 --> 20:25.525
I think we should talk
about last night.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.795
(birds singing)

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
I've had good nights,
I've had bad nights,

20:30.563 --> 20:31.631
but I've never had...

20:31.664 --> 20:34.334
Yes, it was odd.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.602
I don't know
what it was.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.970
(sighs)
What did you see?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.472
What did I...

20:39.506 --> 20:41.007
What do you mean?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.475
When I...

20:42.509 --> 20:44.377
fell unconscious,
what did you see?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.379
I don't know
what you're after.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.615
I... held you.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.883
And then I
got dressed.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.719
So you didn't see anything

20:52.752 --> 20:54.354
near my ears?

20:54.387 --> 20:55.588
Your ears?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.557
No.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.991
Okay, look.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.762
I have these migraines,

21:02.795 --> 21:06.499
and I needed human contact.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.635
And if I wasn't there?

21:08.668 --> 21:09.769
But you were there.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.539
Yeah, but...

21:12.572 --> 21:13.940
When you get these migraines,

21:13.973 --> 21:15.408
what do you do?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.709
Are you asking
if I sleep around?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.311
No. No, I just...

21:18.345 --> 21:19.646
(exhales)

21:19.679 --> 21:21.314
I want to feel like

21:21.348 --> 21:22.749
I wasn't being used last night.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.950
It was great.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.418
It wasn't great. It was weird.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.453
Okay, yes.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.720
(laughs)
It was weird.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.089
What do you want?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.092
For things to be normal.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.794
I want to talk and joke

21:34.827 --> 21:36.095
and take you out to dinner.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.464
And pay.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.333
And then kiss you on
your stoop one night

21:40.367 --> 21:41.601
and feel awkward about
calling you the next day.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.470
And then I talk to my friends
and they say

21:43.503 --> 21:44.504
not to call because I'll
come across too vulnerable,

21:44.537 --> 21:46.606
but of course,
I call anyway.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.475
And then we're,
I don't know,

21:48.508 --> 21:51.778
happy and a little awkward
on the phone together.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.082
Okay.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.517
Let's do that.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.685
Why can't we do that?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.753
Because you were yelling
at me to go faster

22:00.787 --> 22:02.655
while you ate chocolate
and salami.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.592
I just need some time to think.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.595
Makes sense.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.030
Oh, um...

22:11.063 --> 22:13.966
what did you need
when you came by the office?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.905
I need your list
of gerrymander districts.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.041
(quiet chuckle)

22:23.876 --> 22:25.745
We have a bug.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.647
You do?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.548
How did you get it?

22:28.581 --> 22:29.582
GUSTAV:
That...

22:30.883 --> 22:32.452
That would take
some explaining.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.686
We did
a spectrographic test.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.522
It's 90%
potassium chloride.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.857
That could explain
the head explosions.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.427
Potassium chloride
is combustible.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.794
What's the other ten percent?

22:43.095 --> 22:44.597
Unknown.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.965
"Unknown"?

22:45.998 --> 22:47.133
How could it be unknown?

22:47.166 --> 22:49.135
There are some
other oddities here.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.603
It moves.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.472
Even after
you cut it up.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.108
Do you have the bug here?

22:57.610 --> 22:58.945
Yes.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.580
We need your help.

23:00.613 --> 23:01.748
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.950
And we don't have the equipment.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.552
The CDC does.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.722
GUSTAV: We're trusting you
with this.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.724
Someone risked their life
to get this bug.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.761
Gustav, I'm on your side.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.598
(bangs gavel)

23:18.631 --> 23:20.700
There are
38 proposed amendments

23:20.733 --> 23:22.735
to the CDC budget.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.870
We'll address them
one at a time.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.538
Senators will be limited

23:25.572 --> 23:27.640
to five minutes
in discussing markups.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.677
Uh, first, the
proposed $48 million

23:30.710 --> 23:34.547
earmark for disease control
maintenance in New York.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.215
I move to approve.
I second.
Any discussion?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.984
None? All right, then.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.719
If there's no discussion,
we'll move to a vote--

23:39.752 --> 23:41.187
RED:
Actually, Senator,

23:41.220 --> 23:43.556
uh, if you don't mind.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.091
But do you have
an objection, Red?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.059
Well, I'll call it
more of a hesitation.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.562
I'm reading this comic book--

23:49.596 --> 23:52.198
I think the young people
call it, uh, a graphic novel.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.667
It's called, uh,

23:54.701 --> 23:57.570
Preparedness 101:
Zombie Pandemic.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.038
Uh, a constituent
gave it to me.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.607
I thought it was funny.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.775
(chuckles)
But then, uh,

24:02.809 --> 24:05.678
then I realized
who put it out.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.080
It's our very own
Centers for Disease Control.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.617
The real one; the one
we're discussing right now.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.619
They put out a comic book

24:12.652 --> 24:14.621
about how to repel
a zombie attack.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.822
LUKE:
This was merely
a way to get people

24:15.855 --> 24:17.657
who usually
don't care about disease

24:17.690 --> 24:18.658
to read about it.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.959
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.794
I thought I had five minutes.

24:21.828 --> 24:22.995
You do. Continue.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.130
Well, my question,

24:24.163 --> 24:26.098
uh, isn't about
the cost of this.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.700
I'm sure it's negligible.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.702
My question is this.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.505
Is the CDC devoting
practical research time

24:32.539 --> 24:35.642
and money
to a zombie apocalypse?

24:35.675 --> 24:38.010
Okay, that's crazy.
(laughing):
I mean...

24:38.044 --> 24:41.814
Then why are they investigating
bugs that eat human brains?

24:41.848 --> 24:42.782
They're not.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.150
Well, a constituent told me

24:44.183 --> 24:47.119
that a CDC researcher goes

24:47.153 --> 24:49.856
by the name of
Dexter Wu or-or Wah--

24:49.889 --> 24:51.223
Dr. Wu?

24:51.257 --> 24:53.125
...is investigating bugs

24:53.159 --> 24:56.162
that take on zombie-like
characteristics.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.599
This is what I say.

24:59.632 --> 25:03.302
We are about to approve
a $1.3 billon budget

25:03.335 --> 25:04.904
for the CDC.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.139
We owe it to the taxpayers
to make sure this money

25:07.173 --> 25:10.142
isn't spent on more
zombie comic books

25:10.176 --> 25:12.311
and zombie bug research.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.681
(applause)

25:14.714 --> 25:17.750
You're moving that we delay
approval of the CDC budget?

25:17.784 --> 25:20.086
Yes, until such time
as the CDC director

25:20.119 --> 25:21.821
can assure us

25:21.854 --> 25:24.824
that the people's money
isn't being misspent.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.171
Are you studying zombie bugs?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.240
Are you researching

25:41.273 --> 25:43.643
bugs that eat human brains?

25:43.676 --> 25:47.279
Well, I'm doing
research into

25:47.313 --> 25:49.015
a bug that, yes,

25:49.048 --> 25:50.316
like a screwworm
eats human flesh.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.018
Stop.
But, sir--

25:52.051 --> 25:54.153
Our budget is being
held up by this.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.855
This was given to me
by a very trustworthy--

25:55.888 --> 25:57.890
I don't care!

26:22.915 --> 26:25.117
*

27:05.157 --> 27:07.727
*

27:16.368 --> 27:19.238
(indistinct chatter)

27:23.409 --> 27:27.046
1200 Ridge Place Southeast

27:27.079 --> 27:30.850
to 17th Street Southeast.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.052
8600 Good Hope

27:33.085 --> 27:35.021
to 25th Street.

27:37.724 --> 27:43.896
(muttering)

27:43.930 --> 27:46.733
So, everybody
thinks you're crazy.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.067
And I'm here to
calm their fears.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.769
I'm just doing my job.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.403
And what job is that?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.773
Red Wheatus is acting
as a clearing house

27:53.806 --> 27:54.974
to gerrymandering.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.976
Well, he's a senator.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.445
And gerrymandering
only affects house races.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.447
He's working for a Republican
majority in both houses.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.782
So you want to show how

28:02.815 --> 28:04.483
ludicrously drawn
the precincts are,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.786
embarrass Senator Wheatus
into backing off?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.154
Yes.
Okay.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.789
So here's some words of wisdom.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.490
Politicians don't
embarrass easily.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.959
You do.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.493
Mm-mm, I do not.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.328
Senior year,
Mom picking you up from school.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.030
Okay, thank you.
And then that time
your pants

28:18.064 --> 28:19.331
fell down around your knees--
that was good.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.067
Have fun.
I'm going.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.874
You know, the more...

28:27.907 --> 28:30.910
ludicrous the district,
the better.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.412
(door closes)

28:33.445 --> 28:36.082
*

28:38.951 --> 28:42.321
Allegany County.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.017
*

29:27.366 --> 29:29.902
So, you see it, too?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.804
Yeah.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.873
Crop circles.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.308
Come on, you can't be
going crazy, too.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.177
No, I'm just saying

29:38.210 --> 29:39.545
what does it mean?

29:39.578 --> 29:41.380
Nothing.
What could it mean?

29:41.413 --> 29:43.382
You're saying someone
is gerrymandering

29:43.415 --> 29:45.151
districts into crop circles.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.385
That doesn't
make any sense.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.987
Because these bugs
are not of this world.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.321
Oh, my God, you have been
wanting to say that for weeks.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.890
GUSTAV:
How else do you explain all--?

29:50.923 --> 29:51.991
ROCHELLE:
A million reasons!

29:52.024 --> 29:53.893
Demographics. I-I don't know.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.196
But why would creatures
from another world be making

29:57.229 --> 30:00.066
crop circles
out of voting districts?

30:00.099 --> 30:02.101
It makes no sense.
Look.

30:02.134 --> 30:06.072
The circles-- they're all
pointing towards something.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.406
Capitol Hill-- they're
taking over the government.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.908
They're coming for us.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.843
Okay, let's try
to maintain, please.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.478
LAUREL: What did you
find out about that bug?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.180
The one that you caught?
Yeah, Rochelle.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.848
What did we find
out about it?

30:15.882 --> 30:17.383
That has nothing
to do with this.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.118
What?
We gave it
to Wu at the CDC

30:19.151 --> 30:20.386
for a more
"thorough examination,"

30:20.419 --> 30:22.889
and his boss took it
away from him.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.023
Why?

30:24.056 --> 30:25.491
The budget.
Red Wheatus.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.194
ROCHELLE:
They argued the CDC
was being frivolous

30:28.227 --> 30:30.296
with their budget,
looking into bugs.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.431
So everything
was put into storage.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.266
Oh, God.
GUSTAV:
Don't you see?

30:34.300 --> 30:35.868
We're in a game of chess
with a higher intelligence.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.236
That wouldn't be hard.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.471
When we make a move,

30:39.505 --> 30:41.140
they make a counter move.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.042
Where are you going?

30:43.075 --> 30:45.144
To find out
about the CDC.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.445
We take the fight to Red.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.447
He wants to stop
the government from working.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.316
The CDC is just the beginning.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.084
LUKE:
Good, so we're all
on the same page.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.419
We hold together.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.421
Now Amarant's on our side,
so are two other moderate

30:55.454 --> 30:57.323
Republicans.
You're gonna trust
the Republicans?

30:57.356 --> 30:58.557
Ella, stop with
the propaganda.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.559
It's just us here...
Excuse me.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.294
(chuckles)

31:02.328 --> 31:03.462
Propaganda.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.998
You can get the CDC
back up and running?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.599
Yeah, this time
we have the votes.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.136
I just can't be seen
going on about bugs, okay?

31:10.169 --> 31:12.538
Mm-hmm.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.476
Hi.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.146
(paper crumpling)
Hey.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.347
What was that?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.515
Nothing.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.651
Just a note I was leaving.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.120
Well, you could give it to me.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.523
Yeah.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.565
I do.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.501
Good.

31:42.534 --> 31:45.104
Look, I don't want things to--

31:52.378 --> 31:53.612
I don't want

31:53.645 --> 31:55.414
things to be awkward.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.250
And I heard my boss had
a talk with you about us.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.451
Yes.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.187
I told him not to again.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.654
I just don't like

32:02.688 --> 32:04.356
when work impacts...

32:04.390 --> 32:06.192
(chuckles)
life.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.559
So, tonight?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.295
"Tonight"?

32:09.328 --> 32:11.430
Drinks?
Oh, yes.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.999
Um... no.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.566
Unfortunately, I have
to meet a friend.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.469
How about tomorrow night?

32:17.503 --> 32:20.106
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

32:20.139 --> 32:21.540
Gareth?

32:21.573 --> 32:23.309
Thank you.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.644
We can make this normal again.

32:25.677 --> 32:30.616
(quietly):
Yeah.

32:30.649 --> 32:35.021
* Lying close
to floods, oh... *

32:35.054 --> 32:36.388
Hey, Stacie.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.689
Hi.
Loud bar.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.525
Yeah, I know.
Good music.

32:39.558 --> 32:40.626
Ah, let's go some
place quieter.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.228
No, I don't want
people to hear us.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.329
Here.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.363
I have water.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.597
Let's go.
Let's dance.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.233
Why?

32:47.266 --> 32:48.367
'Cause it's fun.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.701
Remember, the West Village?

32:49.735 --> 32:52.004
Like that.
I'm a little tired.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.339
Okay, well, I'm dancing.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.474
Come on, I'll give you
a scoop out there.

32:55.507 --> 32:59.378
* I don't feel done

32:59.411 --> 33:03.315
* Catching me

33:03.349 --> 33:06.452
* Feel so good...

33:06.485 --> 33:07.486
So, you dating anyone?

33:07.519 --> 33:08.620
No.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.656
What about Michael
from last year?

33:10.689 --> 33:13.092
We broke it off.
Yeah, I know.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.326
He made a mistake.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.595
How do you know?
He told me.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.064
I called him.

33:18.097 --> 33:21.267
He said he wanted
to see what you were up to.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.069
Is this what you did with Abby?

33:23.102 --> 33:24.603
Is "what" what I did with Abby?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.405
Try to remake her life.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.540
We're not your
playthings, Laurel.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.710
Take the moat out of your
eye, then worry about me.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.179
No.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.746
No, I know how this works now.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.616
You try to turn it back on me,
you try to make it my problem,

33:37.649 --> 33:39.118
But it's not gonna work.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.752
I felt the bugs
in my head, Stacie.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.421
I know what
they're doing to you.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.556
And I know there's a cure.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.625
There.

33:46.658 --> 33:47.626
That's Michael.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.428
He misses you.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.263
Just give it a chance, Stacie.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.664
Ah. Ow.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.467
Listen to me.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.769
We know what you're doing.
It's not gonna work.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.538
Let go of my hand, Stacie.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.274
She's gone.
Stacie's gone.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.676
You can't get her back. She
doesn't want to come back.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.278
I came back, Stacie.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.713
You just have to use
the right side of your brain.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.648
This is different.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.650
Knock the side of
my head. Go ahead.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.420
(hollow thumping)

34:14.453 --> 34:15.687
There's nothing there.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.724
Go ahead, chase us away.

34:18.757 --> 34:22.194
But your friend will
be a lobotomized idiot.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.462
What do you want?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.433
Everything.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.370
We...

34:31.403 --> 34:33.539
want...

34:33.572 --> 34:35.507
everything.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.645
Are you taking over
the government?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.114
What government?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.615
There is no
government anymore.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.555
(chuckles)

34:49.588 --> 34:51.823
(cackling)

34:58.530 --> 34:59.865
* Be like little bunnies

34:59.898 --> 35:02.434
* Always riding on
the edges of your coat *

35:02.468 --> 35:04.670
* Tails, tails

35:04.703 --> 35:06.538
* Don't be scared or nervous

35:06.572 --> 35:08.674
* 'Cause I'm here, here,
we're here about your finger *

35:08.707 --> 35:10.642
* Nails, nails...

35:10.676 --> 35:11.677
Hey.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.545
Hey... Ow!

35:13.579 --> 35:14.780
Watch it!

35:14.813 --> 35:16.882
Clockwise around the pond.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.650
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing)

35:18.684 --> 35:22.654
(through earbuds): * Well, you
might think I'm crazy *

35:22.688 --> 35:25.724
* To hang around with you

35:25.757 --> 35:28.694
* Maybe you think I'm lucky...

35:32.831 --> 35:34.300
(sighs)

36:02.261 --> 36:03.495
(mouse clicking)

36:08.500 --> 36:10.836
IRA FLATOW:
Does space have a sound?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.871
Thanks to
the wonders of science,

36:12.904 --> 36:14.473
we can now hear
the constellations

36:14.506 --> 36:16.842
of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.877
(dull humming)

36:18.910 --> 36:20.679
DR. WU: We don't know what
it is, Senator.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.714
We wouldn't have discovered
how the Zika virus was carried

36:22.748 --> 36:24.283
if we hadn't done
the spade work.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.318
PAKULA:
We hope that satisfies

36:26.352 --> 36:27.786
your concerns, Senator.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.889
We take taxpayer money
very seriously.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.724
It does satisfy my concerns.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.293
And I

36:34.326 --> 36:36.862
will now entertain a motion
to close debates.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.464
I move that we close...
RED:
Just one more question,

36:38.497 --> 36:39.465
Mr. Chairman, if I may.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.999
I'll be brief.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.968
He knows we have the votes.
He's delaying.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.504
Oh, let him rant.
He's got to save face.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.239
RED:
I can hear you.

36:47.273 --> 36:50.776
And no, despite whatever vote
count you think you have,

36:50.809 --> 36:52.744
I'd like to ask my question.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.714
Let's talk
about your great work

36:55.747 --> 36:57.416
at the CDC, Dr. Pakula.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.950
What are you working on now?

36:58.984 --> 37:01.853
We're testing the impact
of 32 prospective

37:01.887 --> 37:03.322
infectious diseases.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.890
RED: And how do you
test their impact?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.926
With, uh, computer simulations
or...?

37:07.959 --> 37:09.595
No, no, with live testing.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.930
I see. "Live."

37:11.963 --> 37:12.964
Meaning with animals?

37:12.998 --> 37:17.336
Yes, we-we do animal testing.

37:17.369 --> 37:20.038
On rats,
or chimpanzees, or...

37:20.071 --> 37:22.341
Uh, both. Um, why?

37:22.374 --> 37:25.811
So these animals you test, uh,

37:25.844 --> 37:28.680
do they go on to live
long and healthy lives?

37:28.714 --> 37:29.948
Uh, no.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.483
Some expire.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.051
Oh, I see.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.620
(clicks tongue)
Aw.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.456
And you-you bury them
someplace nice?

37:37.489 --> 37:38.990
No,

37:39.024 --> 37:40.992
we have a service who,

37:41.026 --> 37:42.961
um...

37:42.994 --> 37:43.995
well, there are
rendering factories.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.631
Where the dead animals are

37:45.664 --> 37:47.466
boiled down?
LUKE:
Chairman,

37:47.499 --> 37:48.834
I don't think every
step of the process needs

37:48.867 --> 37:50.936
to be examined.
RED:
I just think

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
some of my Democratic colleagues

37:53.004 --> 37:55.841
might be
interested in the process.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.677
How many animals
are killed a month?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.782
Ella, Ella.

38:03.815 --> 38:04.916
Look...

38:04.950 --> 38:07.619
they've always
had animal testing.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.456
Yes, and at some point
we have to say "no."
Well, Red will get his way.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.458
If you vote with Red,
he'll get his way.

38:12.491 --> 38:15.293
Come on, what do you hate more,
Republicans or animal testing?

38:20.632 --> 38:21.700
IRA FLATOW:
Where do they come from?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.801
Electromagnetic...

38:29.007 --> 38:31.410
It's merely the sonification
of light curves

38:31.443 --> 38:33.979
from the outer reaches
of the Milky Way.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.914
Was Pythagoras right?

38:35.947 --> 38:38.083
Is there a
"Music of the Spheres?"

38:38.116 --> 38:39.785
I'd like to think so.

38:39.818 --> 38:40.886
(dull humming)

39:01.072 --> 39:03.509
(melodic tone similar to
"You Might Think" by The Cars)

39:11.683 --> 39:14.019
("You Might Think" by The Cars
plays through laptop)

39:15.521 --> 39:17.923
(song stops,
melodic tone resumes)

39:20.091 --> 39:22.928
(melodic tone stops,
song resumes)

39:24.863 --> 39:26.998
(song stops,
melodic tone resumes)

39:27.032 --> 39:29.034
IRA FLATOW: What you just heard
is the energy arriving

39:29.067 --> 39:33.605
from the Draco constellation,
over 148 light years away.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.781
Yup, that's gerrymandering.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.082
Look at the districts.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.419
What does it look like?

39:47.453 --> 39:50.922
Um... constellations?

39:50.956 --> 39:52.758
No.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.892
Crop circles.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.428
Oh, yeah. Kind of.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.063
No, not "kind of," "lot of."

39:58.096 --> 39:59.798
Yeah, well, I saw
this one district,

39:59.831 --> 40:01.199
it looked like Lincoln's beard.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.869
Then use it.
To embarrass Red.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.805
It's local government,
Laurel, it's not senate.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.807
Yes, but they're coordinating
through Red's office.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.908
Look at these districts.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.477
They're crazy.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.612
Yes, and why would
we stop it? I mean,

40:13.645 --> 40:14.846
look at this district,
Dorchester.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.214
The Republicans used to divide

40:16.247 --> 40:18.650
the senior citizen
vote into two, right?

40:18.684 --> 40:20.952
Now they have them all in one,
right? That's good for us.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.989
It neutralizes the Republican
senior vote. And here?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.591
This puts all the
college-educated together.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.092
I mean, they're helping us,
not hurting us.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.995
And why are they doing that?

40:30.028 --> 40:31.096
(chuckles)

40:31.129 --> 40:33.899
I have no idea.
General stupidity?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.167
Never underestimate the
stupidity of your opponent.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.804
But let's not get in the way.
When your opponent is

40:38.837 --> 40:41.006
shooting themselves
in the foot... let them.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.474
You're over-thinking it, sis.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.009
I have the
appropriations committee.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.844
The CDC budget.
How's it going?

40:45.877 --> 40:47.846
We're losing.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.848
Ella and Red should
be at each other's throats.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.017
It's odd when they're not.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.088
(gavel banging)

40:57.122 --> 40:59.024
Are we ready to vote
on the CDC budget?

40:59.057 --> 41:01.192
Hell yes.
ELLA: Mr. Chairman,
I just have

41:01.226 --> 41:02.494
one thing to say.

41:02.528 --> 41:03.962
(sighs)
Go ahead.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.197
My colleague, Red Wheatus,

41:06.231 --> 41:10.536
wants to derail the CDC
by undercutting its budget.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.939
And I can't support that.
The CDC does good work.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.907
Even though, as
a strong animal lover,

41:15.941 --> 41:19.745
I can't agree
with its... methods.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.913
Still, I want to amend

41:21.947 --> 41:23.882
the proposed bill.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.251
The CDC should
be more ambitious.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.119
More like our friends
in Finland,

41:28.153 --> 41:30.822
who aren't satisfied
with just getting by,

41:30.856 --> 41:32.123
like we Americans are.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.626
I would like to
challenge the CDC

41:34.660 --> 41:38.063
into fighting a war on death.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.966
And I move that
we give the CDC

41:40.999 --> 41:43.935
an additional $3 billion

41:43.969 --> 41:46.905
to help fight such a war.
Ella...

41:46.938 --> 41:48.840
What is she doing?

41:48.874 --> 41:50.208
Uh, closing you down.

41:50.241 --> 41:54.012
The Republicans will never
double your budget.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.281
This country can't survive
without the CDC.

41:56.314 --> 41:59.851
Yeah, well, we're about to try.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.328
What?

42:10.361 --> 42:13.164
There's a chance Gustav's right.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.233
About what?

42:21.807 --> 42:24.042
(chittering)

42:30.616 --> 42:33.952
GARETH:
Okay, so, let's start over.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.787
Okay.

42:35.821 --> 42:37.055
I'm Gareth.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.124
I'm a chief of staff
to Red Wheatus.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.961
I'm Laurel Healy.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.029
And I think I'm going insane.

42:44.062 --> 42:47.132
Well, if we're being honest,

42:47.165 --> 42:48.233
why insane?

42:50.168 --> 42:51.870
Because I think bugs
are eating people's brains

42:51.903 --> 42:53.338
and turning them stupid.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.806
(chuckles)

43:07.085 --> 43:08.153
Huh.
