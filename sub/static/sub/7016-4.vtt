00:06.808 --> 00:12.961
So, thank you for celebrating
our 25th anniversary with us.

00:13.213 --> 00:17.226
You know, nothing makes me
appreciate my beautiful wife more then

00:17.270 --> 00:20.880
a room full of people that
I don't like as much as her.

00:22.699 --> 00:24.178
Okay, my turn.

00:24.371 --> 00:25.332
Um...

00:26.752 --> 00:28.510
Mr. and Mrs. Forman,

00:29.072 --> 00:32.194
your long and happy marriage

00:32.223 --> 00:34.368
got me thinking
about my future.

00:34.767 --> 00:38.983
And...when I think about my future
there is always someone special in it.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.113
I mean besides me.

00:41.862 --> 00:42.818
So,

00:43.508 --> 00:45.814
in front of all the
people that I love,

00:48.908 --> 00:51.208
Jacqueline Burkhardt,
will you marry me ?

Two days before Kelso
proposed to Jackie.

01:33.186 --> 01:34.481
Look at this Red,

01:34.538 --> 01:37.480
what is more beautiful then a
sweaty broad doing your laundry ?

01:38.895 --> 01:40.852
How about a
smart-mouth foreigner

01:40.896 --> 01:43.810
gasping for air as I hold
his head in the toilet ?

01:47.505 --> 01:51.113
Oh, here, let me take
that for you sweetie !

01:56.747 --> 01:57.523
Oh...

01:58.288 --> 02:00.810
I am so light-headed !

02:01.407 --> 02:04.420
I don't think I can
clean out the lint trap.

02:06.505 --> 02:08.523
Well it could cause a fire.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.471
Wow, Mrs. Forman.

02:12.858 --> 02:17.792
You and Mr. Forman seem happier then I've ever
seen you...in the two times I've ever seen you...

02:18.297 --> 02:21.973
Well that's because it's our
25th anniversary in two days.

02:22.015 --> 02:24.312
Wooow, 25 years ?

02:24.346 --> 02:27.390
Man if you guys were
dogs, that would be like...

02:32.307 --> 02:34.010
25 dog years.

02:36.465 --> 02:37.393
Anyway.

02:37.577 --> 02:40.613
I'm throwing a surprise
party, but don't tell Red.

02:40.658 --> 02:43.983
Ever since Pearl Harbour
he has hated surprises.

02:48.037 --> 02:48.981
Hey,

02:49.025 --> 02:50.813
I won another free Pepsi !

02:50.845 --> 02:53.600
You always win ! I never
win ! I wish you were dead.

02:56.348 --> 02:57.123
Oh.

02:57.485 --> 02:58.992
That was a dark place...

03:00.038 --> 03:02.532
Okay, I'm working on
an bit for my new act.

03:03.877 --> 03:06.440
What is sexier ?
This genie costume,

03:06.808 --> 03:08.480
or my naughty
stewardess outfit ?

03:08.505 --> 03:13.093
Sam ! What did I tell you about parading
around half-naked in front of my friends ?

03:13.498 --> 03:15.860
If you're gonna do it,
you've gotta charge 'm !

03:19.918 --> 03:20.771
Man.

03:21.287 --> 03:24.753
It's like everyone is so
happy lately. Except for me.

03:24.938 --> 03:30.763
I mean the Forman's have their anniversary
party, Hyde is married to half-naked girl.

03:32.025 --> 03:33.830
What do I got ? Nothing !

03:33.865 --> 03:37.360
Except for this little
plastic dinosaur.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.931
You know, when I'm down, I try to think
about the happiest times of my life.

03:44.956 --> 03:47.891
Like when Hyde's wife came out
here in that genie outfit...

03:49.595 --> 03:52.202
The happiest time of my life
was when I was with Jackie.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.211
What are you
talking about ?!

03:54.236 --> 03:57.750
She was always yelling at you, hitting
you, telling you what a moron you are.

03:58.028 --> 03:59.680
You might as well
have been dating me.

04:01.695 --> 04:04.260
Man, I was really
in love with her.

04:04.318 --> 04:07.071
And then I blew it.
And then she blew it.

04:07.636 --> 04:09.302
And then I blew it again.

04:10.248 --> 04:13.222
I don't know who blew it last,
but I'm definitely winning !

04:14.328 --> 04:18.051
It sounds like you guys had a real on again-off
again, on again-off again, on again-off again,

04:18.278 --> 04:20.250
on again-off
again relationship.

04:20.658 --> 04:21.541
Wait...

04:21.865 --> 04:24.520
that's it ! That's
why I'm not happy !

04:24.558 --> 04:28.190
Cause the girl I should be with is right
in front of me and I'm not with her !

04:28.505 --> 04:30.370
I should be with Jackie !

04:30.418 --> 04:32.881
Nooo, I should
marry Jackie !

04:39.145 --> 04:40.883
What ?! I love weddings.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.261
Dad ! It's four in the
morning. What are you doing up ?

04:50.537 --> 04:52.650
Spending a little
time with the colonel.

04:55.217 --> 04:56.362
So why are you up ?

04:56.386 --> 04:58.043
Eric's calling from Africa.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.462
You know, I never realised how nerdy he was
until I started spending three bucks a minute

05:02.495 --> 05:04.993
filling him in on
Battlestar Galactica.

05:09.057 --> 05:11.003
Well, I'll give
you your privacy.

05:11.028 --> 05:13.440
I like eating chicken
better in bed anyway.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.080
Everything is a napkin.

05:24.685 --> 05:25.990
- Sweetheart !
- What ?

05:27.025 --> 05:28.833
Did you stay down
here all night ?

05:28.868 --> 05:30.693
Oh yeah. I guess so.

05:30.796 --> 05:32.833
Eric never called,
I hope he is okay.

05:32.857 --> 05:35.750
Yeah I'm sure he's fine.
Either that or he's dead.

05:39.566 --> 05:41.551
It can only be
one of the two !

05:48.057 --> 05:49.353
And get this,

05:49.378 --> 05:52.251
I waited up for Eric to call
me last night, and he never did.

05:52.276 --> 05:57.311
So I asked Mrs. Forman "Is he okay ?" and she
said yeah, because he called her last night.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.122
Yeah I mean that is weird.

05:59.186 --> 06:03.981
Who would think that a boy who plays with dolls
and bails on his wedding would be a Momma's boy.

06:05.815 --> 06:07.670
I know a huge secret.

06:07.705 --> 06:11.451
But don't bother to ask me because there
is no way in hell I'm going to tell you.

06:11.476 --> 06:13.633
Kelso is gonna ask
Jackie to marry him...

06:14.375 --> 06:15.911
Wait...what ?! Oh my God !

06:15.935 --> 06:18.473
I can't believe you conniving
whores got it out of me !

06:19.378 --> 06:23.241
That is the dumbest thing Kelso
said since his previous gem:

06:23.265 --> 06:25.463
I can eat an entire shirt.

06:25.947 --> 06:27.922
This is so Michael.

06:28.937 --> 06:30.741
Although it is kinda sweet.

06:31.897 --> 06:34.542
And I don't really have
anything going for me in my life.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.630
No job...no boyfriend...

06:38.455 --> 06:40.013
God I don't have anything !

06:41.685 --> 06:44.142
Okay Jackie, I
know you're lonely,

06:44.348 --> 06:47.410
but you and Kelso getting
married, that's insane.

06:47.587 --> 06:49.891
Well I actually think
it makes total sense.

06:49.917 --> 06:53.071
No it doesn't. It
makes no sense !

06:53.155 --> 06:56.981
Fliebedieflabediefloobedie
makes more sense then that !

06:57.178 --> 06:58.590
What if it's fate ?

06:59.476 --> 07:02.280
I mean I have always thought
of Michael as my soul mate.

07:02.316 --> 07:05.890
I mean, yes, we have our problems, but
getting married will fix everything.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.643
And if that doesn't work,
you can just have a kid.

07:11.137 --> 07:14.031
Oh my God, I'm so excited !

07:14.557 --> 07:15.903
I wonder when he
is gonna ask me.

07:15.928 --> 07:19.100
Well that is a secret...
At the Forman's party.

07:20.465 --> 07:22.372
You bitches are relentless !

07:29.015 --> 07:30.082
You guys !

07:30.385 --> 07:32.821
I just got offered the
best job in the world !

07:32.848 --> 07:36.411
I'm gonna be a security guard
at the Playboy club in Chicago !

07:38.636 --> 07:39.691
How the hell
did that happen ?

07:39.727 --> 07:41.891
Okay last week I
was in Chicago right,

07:41.915 --> 07:45.640
and I did what I always do after I visit
my daughter, I snuck into the Playboy club.

07:46.416 --> 07:50.820
And as the guards were kicking me out,
I thought to myself, I could do that !

07:51.126 --> 07:53.540
So then I talked
to this guy there.

07:55.125 --> 07:58.752
So, let me tell you a little bit about
what Vic does around here at the club.

07:58.786 --> 08:00.783
Ahh wait...
ahh... who's Vic ?

08:00.805 --> 08:02.423
I'm Vic, keep up.

08:03.606 --> 08:04.841
What Vic does,

08:05.168 --> 08:08.183
is I'm responsible for
overseeing security here.

08:08.225 --> 08:11.853
You see, it is our job to
keep the girls safe and secure.

08:13.386 --> 08:14.291
Oh, yeah.

08:15.666 --> 08:18.143
Yeah we're safe
and secure today...

08:20.365 --> 08:22.371
uhuh...lather it up Brenda !

08:23.635 --> 08:26.202
Uhhh... Michael
wants to see Brenda !

08:26.367 --> 08:27.170
No,

08:27.296 --> 08:30.633
employees only. We've got a code
of ethics around here Michael.

08:30.806 --> 08:31.913
It's right there.

08:33.316 --> 08:34.102
So,

08:34.726 --> 08:36.673
Vic tells me you
used to be a cop ?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.971
Uhh wait, I thought
that you were Vic ?

08:38.996 --> 08:41.331
There's another
Vic, try to keep up.

08:41.607 --> 08:45.111
Uhh yeah, well I got, I
got kicked off the force.

08:45.148 --> 08:48.351
Then I was gonna make the move
here to be closer to my daughter...

08:48.398 --> 08:49.562
What, you're married ?

08:49.707 --> 08:51.463
I do not see you
wearing a ring.

08:51.712 --> 08:53.578
Great minds think alike !

08:53.948 --> 08:56.884
Actually uhh I just
got a girl pregnant.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.738
You got a girl pregnant ?

08:59.296 --> 09:00.853
I got a girl pregnant !

09:00.915 --> 09:02.912
Give Vic a high five !

09:03.317 --> 09:05.002
You-Vic or the other Vic ?

09:05.465 --> 09:07.401
The other Vic ? What is
that some kind of a joke ?

09:07.446 --> 09:09.800
The other Vic got both his
hands blows off in 'Nam.

09:09.856 --> 09:11.332
Haha, I'm just kidding !

09:11.365 --> 09:12.772
I like your sense
of humour kid.

09:14.075 --> 09:18.023
Now come here, all kidding aside, I
want to ask you something seriously.

09:20.967 --> 09:22.810
Do you like spicy food ?

09:23.878 --> 09:27.131
Sure, I'll eat anything.
Actually I put that on the resume.

09:27.176 --> 09:29.822
Try this salsa.

09:30.357 --> 09:33.300
Go on, makes you feel like
you got shot in the tongue.

09:33.776 --> 09:35.933
How can I say no to that ?!

09:40.558 --> 09:41.502
Ooohhhh !

09:41.915 --> 09:42.933
Whoooooo !

09:42.965 --> 09:45.191
Yeah that hot,
that's hot right.

09:45.227 --> 09:49.882
Yeah, you know it's hot when you get
all moist and sweaty up under here eh !

09:51.047 --> 09:52.350
Come on, feel it !

09:52.386 --> 09:55.033
Ah I don't think I
wanna touch Vic's head...

09:55.086 --> 09:56.762
- No, go ahead, feel it...
- No I really don't...

09:56.818 --> 09:58.343
- Feel it !
- Okay.

10:00.625 --> 10:01.731
- Haaaaa,
- Gotcha !

10:09.187 --> 10:12.681
And he just called and
offered me the job !

10:13.046 --> 10:17.861
Ahh men, it's like I was really looking for some
direction and that's why I was gonna get married,

10:17.898 --> 10:20.722
but now that'll be just
like crazy you know !

10:21.598 --> 10:24.422
Thank God I didn't say
anything to Jackie !

10:25.627 --> 10:26.482
Uh oh Kelso...

10:26.517 --> 10:28.693
Oh man, she has
absolutely no idea !

10:28.726 --> 10:29.801
If I could just
get a word in...

10:29.836 --> 10:34.002
For once in my life I didn't just blurt
something out and I ruined everything !

10:34.036 --> 10:36.421
- Yes about that... - It's
like i'm all scot-free !

10:36.936 --> 10:38.951
Kelso ! Listen to me !

10:39.137 --> 10:41.920
I told Jackie you were
proposing and now she's thrilled.

10:45.755 --> 10:47.462
How could you do that ?!

10:48.105 --> 10:49.860
I know. I have a problem.

10:51.855 --> 10:53.872
Actually, now you
have a problem.

10:56.066 --> 10:56.880
So...

10:58.365 --> 10:59.611
good luck with that.

11:06.336 --> 11:09.541
You told Jackie I was
gonna propose to her ?!

11:09.745 --> 11:13.042
Yes and you should have seen all
the squealing and jumping around !

11:14.435 --> 11:16.402
And Jackie was excited too !

11:18.708 --> 11:21.343
You guys are idiots. Who gets
married on a whim anyway ?

11:21.386 --> 11:22.341
You did.

11:24.066 --> 11:25.840
Yeah but that was
to a stripper !

11:26.466 --> 11:30.161
And to be fair, I was pretty drunk,
so I might have been trying to say:

11:30.207 --> 11:31.853
Will you carry me ?

11:33.475 --> 11:35.202
It's like I
love Jackie okay,

11:35.236 --> 11:39.313
and I know that some day we're
gonna be together but just not yet.

11:39.646 --> 11:41.581
You fool, don't
you understand ?!

11:43.518 --> 11:47.392
Hyde really screwed Jackie up, and she is only
going to be like this for a little while longer.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.201
You gotta strike when the
broad is still a mess man !

11:51.967 --> 11:53.292
Look Kelso,

11:53.326 --> 11:56.473
I'm completely against
this un-holy union.

11:56.597 --> 11:59.661
But if you really want to be with
Jackie, you cannot run away now.

11:59.725 --> 12:02.172
She'll be so pissed she'll
never talk to you again.

12:03.596 --> 12:04.683
Okay so...

12:04.957 --> 12:07.391
you're saying if I don't
go through with this now,

12:07.467 --> 12:09.660
I'm gonna blow my chances
with Jackie forever ?

12:09.717 --> 12:10.490
Yes.

12:11.028 --> 12:13.651
You have succesfully
repeated what I just said.

12:18.057 --> 12:19.083
That's it.

12:19.897 --> 12:21.592
I wanna ask
Jackie to marry me.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.481
Great ! Let's
go buy a ring !

12:24.446 --> 12:27.753
No, Jackie once said that she'd rather
have a balloon tied around her finger

12:27.787 --> 12:29.651
than a diamond
under two carats.

12:30.647 --> 12:32.613
So let's go buy a balloon !

12:35.798 --> 12:38.442
Jackie you can't
marry Kelso.

12:39.038 --> 12:41.321
Picture what your
life would be like...

12:46.005 --> 12:47.870
Hi honey, how was your day ?

12:48.325 --> 12:51.032
Ahhh great. I had
another affair.

12:51.696 --> 12:52.351
What ?!

12:52.788 --> 12:54.670
Okay, you told
me not to lie !

12:54.717 --> 12:56.600
Yeah I told you not
to lie or cheat !

12:56.638 --> 12:58.820
Right and I
chose not to lie !

12:58.937 --> 13:00.862
Well can I at least have
some money for groceries ?

13:00.897 --> 13:03.762
Sorry babe, I got fired again, but I
know what will make you feel better !

13:03.796 --> 13:06.232
Oh no ! Not another
box of dogs !

13:06.278 --> 13:08.162
It's another a box of dogs !

13:10.676 --> 13:14.983
No, no Michael, no, no, this
is not the life I pictured !

13:15.025 --> 13:17.610
I had dreams of a
career, of travel.

13:17.635 --> 13:20.462
Of a husband who didn't
have a girlfriend !

13:21.685 --> 13:24.111
Babe I hear ya, I do,

13:24.148 --> 13:25.442

13:25.675 --> 13:26.871
But you know what

13:27.128 --> 13:29.081

13:29.985 --> 13:32.891
Hey kids, I pantst
you Mom again !

13:33.377 --> 13:35.550
- Who wants to jump off the roof ?!
- Yeah !

13:37.696 --> 13:39.701
That's your life Jackie.

13:41.275 --> 13:42.183
Oh yeah ?

13:42.565 --> 13:46.700
Well, just for that, I'm gonna toss
my bouquet while you're in the can !

13:51.925 --> 13:52.740
Kitty ?

13:53.125 --> 13:54.322
What's all this ?

13:54.617 --> 13:55.700
Surprise !

13:57.028 --> 13:59.210
We're having an
anniversary party.

13:59.387 --> 14:00.952
But I don't want a party !

14:00.996 --> 14:03.520
I was gonna take you
to... the boat show !

14:03.547 --> 14:05.363
I'm not going
to a boat show.

14:06.796 --> 14:09.801
Fine ! It's a vodka-show,
just get in the car !

14:12.757 --> 14:15.310
Red, we have
people coming over.

14:15.345 --> 14:16.750
But I had pl...

14:17.358 --> 14:18.093
Okay,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.882
I was thinking,
about what we did

14:24.158 --> 14:28.383
at the Starlight Motel for the first
time between our wedding and reception ?

14:28.957 --> 14:29.803
And,

14:30.617 --> 14:34.041
I thought we could go there again,
exactly twenty-five years later.

14:34.236 --> 14:35.330
So I...

14:35.918 --> 14:37.510
got us the same room..

14:37.727 --> 14:40.291
To celebrate our
silver anniversary ?

14:40.396 --> 14:44.810
You wanna take me for an
afternoon tryst to a cheap motel ?

14:49.675 --> 14:52.443
That is so romantic !

14:57.588 --> 14:58.400
Man,

14:58.657 --> 15:02.720
I'm all ready to propose and the Formans are
late for their own 25th anniversary party !

15:02.757 --> 15:05.142
So, don't they realise
this is my night ?!

15:06.967 --> 15:08.882
When is Michael
going to ask me ?!

15:08.917 --> 15:10.900
I can't stand
the anticipation !

15:10.946 --> 15:14.633
This must be how fat girls feel between
placing their order and getting their fries.

15:17.687 --> 15:18.463
Here,

15:18.675 --> 15:20.523
take this, it
will relax you.

15:20.706 --> 15:23.733
And if it doesn't work out between
you and Kelso, it'll loosen you up.

15:24.496 --> 15:25.401
For me.

15:28.425 --> 15:29.250
Oh.

15:29.977 --> 15:32.110
Oh my goodness

15:33.268 --> 15:33.972
Oh.

15:40.986 --> 15:42.673
Everybody is here...

15:44.157 --> 15:46.053
what time is it ? Oh.

15:46.998 --> 15:49.903
Oh, I must have left
my watch at the...

15:50.605 --> 15:51.893
Ice store.

15:53.187 --> 15:54.772
But they were out of ice.

15:55.308 --> 15:56.452
Everyone of them.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.673
This country is
in the crapper.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.263
Hello ?

16:08.167 --> 16:08.861
Okay.

16:10.396 --> 16:13.461
Mrs. Forman, that was
the Starlight Motel.

16:15.758 --> 16:18.751
They uhh found your watch
in the Aphrodite suite.

16:21.368 --> 16:22.243
Hayyyyooooooo !

16:27.907 --> 16:29.673
Just keep the damn watch !

16:30.715 --> 16:32.460
Ohhh, hi Eric !

16:33.907 --> 16:35.943
Oh thanks sweetie. Oh

16:35.988 --> 16:38.420
Donna is right here,
why don't you say hi !

16:39.015 --> 16:41.391
Hi ! Let me just switch
to another room...

16:43.106 --> 16:43.780
Oh.

16:44.485 --> 16:45.401
Okay.

16:46.115 --> 16:49.050
I'll talk to you
later then. I love you.

16:51.998 --> 16:53.900
He had to run to class...

16:54.746 --> 16:56.572
So...I'm gonna
go grab a beer...

16:58.946 --> 17:00.910
The Aphrodite suite huh ?

17:00.958 --> 17:03.602
Sounds like you
guys Aphro-did-it !

17:04.476 --> 17:05.512
Hayyoooooo !

17:09.238 --> 17:11.092
- Hey, are you okay ?
- Totally.

17:11.484 --> 17:12.963
Yeah are you kidding.

17:13.828 --> 17:14.732
Totally.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.143
Look, I'm sure Eric
was just in a hurry.

17:17.175 --> 17:20.843
I have not been to Africa, but if it's
anything like Disneyland's Jungle Safari,

17:20.866 --> 17:22.560
you gotta stand
on your toes.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.740
I wouldn't know, I'm more of an
"It's A Small World" kind of girl.

17:27.778 --> 17:29.812
Yeah, I do not
like that ride.

17:30.088 --> 17:31.390
Why, it's too boring ?

17:31.426 --> 17:34.291
No, I just feel the Irish
are under-represented.

17:35.735 --> 17:38.501
Yeah ! Here, free sixpack.

17:39.936 --> 17:41.433
Okay, my turn,

17:41.698 --> 17:42.442
err...

17:44.037 --> 17:45.773
Mr. and Mrs. Forman,

17:46.425 --> 17:49.412
your long and happy marriage

17:49.525 --> 17:51.500
got me thinking
about my future.

17:52.078 --> 17:56.130
And... when I think about my future
there is always someone special in it.

17:56.678 --> 17:58.003
I mean besides me.

17:59.198 --> 17:59.940
So,

18:00.827 --> 18:02.940
in front of all the
people that I love.

18:06.197 --> 18:08.403
Jacqueline Burkhardt,
will you marry me ?

18:10.155 --> 18:11.452
Oh Michael !

18:12.398 --> 18:14.703
- No.
- Congratu...What the hell ?

18:19.346 --> 18:20.691
- No ?
- No.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.080
Jackie,

18:24.088 --> 18:27.580
you have just made me the
happiest man in the world !

18:29.486 --> 18:30.981
- Really ?
- Yeaaahhh !

18:32.285 --> 18:34.000
Ohhh maaaannn !

18:34.035 --> 18:36.540
I mean, I love you and
all, but, it's like...

18:36.585 --> 18:39.492
this is like the worst
idea I've ever had !

18:40.275 --> 18:43.571
And I have had some bad ideas !
I mean, a fire-crackersuit ?!

18:43.616 --> 18:45.253
Like what the
hell was that ?

18:46.876 --> 18:49.351
The best 4th of June
ever, that's what !

18:50.868 --> 18:54.351
Michael, if you and I got
married it would be a disaster.

18:54.377 --> 18:57.243
I mean I love you, but you
have so much growing up to do.

18:57.276 --> 19:00.142
Oh and I do not want a box
of puppies running around.

19:00.188 --> 19:02.040
- You see and I do !
- I know !

19:02.066 --> 19:05.503
Oh man ! This is like my
life is finally taking off.

19:05.525 --> 19:07.261
I'm moving to Chicago !

19:07.287 --> 19:08.951
Donna, I hope I
did the right thing.

19:08.998 --> 19:12.130
I'm so happy, I'm gonna
jump off the roof !

19:14.665 --> 19:15.960
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah.

19:21.886 --> 19:24.040
So it's the last
circle before I go.

19:26.487 --> 19:27.491
Wait a minute,

19:28.335 --> 19:30.860
now I get why we
call it a circle !

19:31.157 --> 19:33.452
That is freakin' awesome !

19:34.536 --> 19:37.671
You know Michael, I will always
remember the first boy who kissed me.

19:37.715 --> 19:41.872
And proposed to me and told me that
putting out makes your nails grow.

19:42.677 --> 19:44.380
I really believed you.

19:45.775 --> 19:49.212
Kelso, I'm kinda gonna miss you
constantly trying to grab my boob.

19:49.738 --> 19:51.422
Made me feel pretty.

19:52.727 --> 19:54.422
I am messed up...

19:55.607 --> 19:58.190
Donna I give you my word.
I wil always be here.

19:58.228 --> 19:59.821
Trying to grab your boob.

20:00.468 --> 20:02.003
We'll do it for Kelso.

20:02.557 --> 20:05.121
. Who won't be here
to do it anymore...

20:06.337 --> 20:07.840
Oh God...

20:10.128 --> 20:10.993
Man.

20:11.898 --> 20:13.571
Kelso this is weird.

20:13.978 --> 20:16.441
Kelso this is weird. I always
imagined our last moment together

20:16.496 --> 20:17.553
would be me

20:17.768 --> 20:20.401
watching you strap
to a home-made rocket.

20:21.256 --> 20:25.081
Flying around in circles screaming:
"turn it off, turn it off !"

20:29.787 --> 20:31.492
Well. I guess
this is goodbye.

20:32.985 --> 20:35.010
Man, I'm gonna miss this.

20:35.958 --> 20:40.182
Like being down here, I've had
like, the best time of my life.

20:40.608 --> 20:42.761
And you what, no
matter where I live,

20:43.008 --> 20:45.423
I will love you
guys forever.

20:48.655 --> 20:51.030
Well. This is
the time to go.

20:51.137 --> 20:51.922
So.

20:53.306 --> 20:54.233
See ya.

20:55.225 --> 20:56.460
Bye Michael.

20:57.416 --> 20:58.212
Wow.

20:59.026 --> 21:00.492
He is really gone.

21:01.496 --> 21:03.530
My beautiful tormentor...

21:05.005 --> 21:06.440
This sucks.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.160
I'm not leaving until tomorrow
! And you were crying !

21:13.405 --> 21:14.473
Buuuurrrnnnn !

21:25.135 --> 21:26.393
Can it be ?!

21:29.498 --> 21:31.190
It finally happened !

21:31.267 --> 21:32.472

21:32.527 --> 21:37.852
I won ! I wooohooon

21:37.885 --> 21:40.691
I won a bike ! Read
it and weep, loser !

That expired yesterday.

21:43.805 --> 21:44.740
