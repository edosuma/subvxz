LAURA, GO
AND GET YOUR PA.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.216
TELL HIM
BUNNY'S HURT.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.219
CAN'T SHE
GET UP, GRANDPA?

14:06.387 --> 14:07.595
I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE,

14:07.763 --> 14:09.097
BUT YOU GO GET
YOUR PA.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.348
HE SHOULD BE
HOME BY NOW.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.393
BUNNY WILL BE
ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.981
ALL RIGHT, GIRL,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.709
PA!

14:37.877 --> 14:39.002
HALF-PINT,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:39.169 --> 14:41.170
-YOU GOT TO COME.
-WHAT IS IT? IS IT GRANDPA?

14:41.338 --> 14:45.049
NO. IT'S BUNNY.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.927
SHE'S HURT BAD,
REAL BAD.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.013
IT WAS A WIRE FENCE.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.639
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.974
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.643
IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU GO ON.
GET IN THE WAGON.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.063
FOOLS AND
THEIR FENCES.

15:02.651 --> 15:03.860
OH, CHARLES.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.739
I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD
THE HORSE IS HURT.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.516
HOW BAD DOES
IT LOOK, PA?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.060
I WANTED YOU
TO CHECK.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.149
[BUNNY GROANING]

15:49.281 --> 15:50.949
[WHISPERING]
EASY, GIRL.
EASY.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.582
WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE YOU ALL
RIGHT, BUNNY.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.376
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.137
PA, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE LAURA
ON HOME.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.643
NO, PA. NO.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.604
I'M SORRY,
HALF-PINT. BUNNY'S
HURT TOO BAD.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.773
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

16:23.941 --> 16:24.983
NO!

16:26.777 --> 16:27.986
HALF-PINT, THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.779
NOW, I WANT
YOU TO GO HOME
WITH YOUR GRANDPA.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.118
PLEASE, PA.
PLEASE.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.786
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.413
GO WITH YOUR
GRANDFATHER NOW.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.916
GRANDPA?

16:47.548 --> 16:51.092
PLEASE. PLEASE
DON'T LET HIM DO IT.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.306
HE HAS TO
LISTEN TO YOU.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.599
YOU'RE HIS PA.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.019
DON'T LET HIM DO IT.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.146
CHILD, I...

17:03.313 --> 17:05.815
YOU SAID YOU'D
MAKE HER ALL RIGHT.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.859
YOU PROMISED.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.278
HALF-PINT,
I WANT YOU TO GO HOME
WITH YOUR GRANDPA.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.157
NO.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.325
YOU PROMISED, GRANDPA.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.703
YOU SAID YOU'D
MAKE HER ALL RIGHT.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.496
PLEASE MAKE HER BETTER!

17:20.664 --> 17:23.166
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.459
YOU PROMISED.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.463
PA, TAKE HER HOME.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.841
NO, I'LL TEND
THE HORSE.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.637
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:38.098 --> 17:39.015
I'LL TEND HER.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.017
I PROMISED.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.521
PA, SHE'S ALL BROKEN UP.
SHE'S IN PAIN!

17:45.689 --> 17:47.482
I GOT TO TRY.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.826
HALF-PINT, YOU LEAVE
YOUR GRANDPA AND ME
ALONE FOR A MINUTE.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.169
DON'T LET HIM
DO ANYTHING,
GRANDPA.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.712
I WON'T, CHILD.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.893
WHY ARE YOU DOING
THIS TO ME, PA?

18:24.061 --> 18:25.937
SHE LOVES ME.
SHE EXPECTS ME
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

18:26.105 --> 18:26.896
BUT YOU CAN'T.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.397
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

18:28.565 --> 18:30.858
COME ON, PA.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT!
NOW, YOU GOT TO TELL HER.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.276
YOU GOT HER THINKING
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.903
I CAN'T PUT THAT POOR
ANIMAL OUT OF ITS MISERY

18:34.071 --> 18:35.863
UNTIL YOU TELL HER THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.909
I CAN'T.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.453
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.
WE'RE NOT PLAYING
SOME KIND OF A GAME NOW,

18:42.621 --> 18:44.747
LIKE BRINGING A TURKEY
BACK TO ITS FOLKS.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.415
THERE'S AN ANIMAL
LYING THERE IN PAIN

18:46.583 --> 18:48.417
ON ACCOUNT OF YOU WANT
TO CONVINCE A CHILD
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.253
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.797
NOW, YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL HER.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.015
YOU TELL HER, PA.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.577
BUNNY'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T SHE, GRANDPA?

19:24.955 --> 19:26.038
I'M...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.125
I'M AFRAID SHE...

19:31.503 --> 19:34.338
I'M AFRAID SHE'S WORSE
OFF THAN I FIGURED.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.674
IT'LL JUST
TAKE HER LONGER
TO MEND, THEN.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.219
NO, CHILD...

19:42.472 --> 19:43.306
SHE WON'T MEND.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.433
BUT YOU PROMISED.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.059
YOU SAID YOU'D
MAKE HER BETTER.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.604
WELL, I WANTED HER
TO BE ALL RIGHT. I--

19:49.771 --> 19:51.480
HALF-PINT,
YOU GO HOME NOW.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.108
YOU GO HOME
WITH YOUR GRANDPA.

19:54.276 --> 19:58.738
NO. I WON'T GO
WITH HIM.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.989
HE LIED.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.535
HE PROMISED ME,
BUT HE JUST LIED.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.977
[GUNSHOT]

21:13.855 --> 21:16.983
PA, COME ON, NOW.
LET'S HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.

21:17.150 --> 21:21.445
NO, I...
I'M TIRED.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.357
ISN'T GRANDPA
COMING TO SUPPER?

22:39.524 --> 22:40.483
NO.

22:40.650 --> 22:44.195
ISN'T HE
HUNGRY TONIGHT?

22:44.363 --> 22:45.863
NO, NOT TONIGHT.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.656
SHE'S ASLEEP.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.664
DEAR LORD,
HELP US THIS DAY.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.043
WE'VE LOST
A DEAR FRIEND.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.089
WE PRAY THAT YOU'LL
GIVE US STRENGTH
IN OUR SORROW...

23:05.217 --> 23:07.843
THAT YOU'LL HELP
TO HEAL THE GREAT PAIN
IN OUR LITTLE GIRL.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.890
WE THANK YOU,
LORD, FOR ALL YOUR
BLESSINGS, O LORD.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.310
AMEN.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.196
THANK YOU, MARY.
CHARLES,
YOU READY?

23:27.364 --> 23:28.280
YEP.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.615
I JUST
HAVE TO PUT
ON MY BONNET.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.659
-I'LL GET GRANDPA.
-THANK YOU.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.370
LAURA, WILL YOU
TAKE THE PICNIC
BASKET?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.663
YES, MA'AM.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.706
I MADE AN EXTRA
PIE JUST FOR
MR. EDWARDS.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.291
YOU CAN SURPRISE
HIM WITH IT.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.294
DO I HAVE TO GO, MA?

23:42.462 --> 23:45.131
I DON'T FEEL
MUCH LIKE GOING.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.882
MARY, WILL YOU TAKE
CARRIE AND WAIT
IN THE WAGON?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.301
YES, MA.
COME ON, CARRIE.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.477
LAURA...

24:00.188 --> 24:01.772
I KNOW HOW
YOU'RE FEELING...

24:03.358 --> 24:05.734
BUT WHEN
WE HAVE A REALLY
DEEP HURT,

24:05.902 --> 24:08.362
GOD IS THE ONE
WHO CAN REALLY
HELP.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.823
HE HAS
THE STRENGTH
TO HELP US.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.785
GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO HELP YOU.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.545
THAT'S MY GIRL.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.689
PA?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.319
PA, WE'RE READY!

24:49.279 --> 24:51.155
NO, YOU--
YOU GO AHEAD.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.325
COME ON WITH US,
PLEASE, PA.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.743
WE'RE GOING TO
PICNIC AFTERWARDS.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.581
PA?

25:24.022 --> 25:26.315
CHARLES, YOU WANT A CHAW?

25:26.483 --> 25:28.150
NO, THANKS.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.777
I KNOW IT'S A NASTY HABIT.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.905
GRACE KEEPS PESTERING
ME TO QUIT.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.157
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES
MORE SENSE TO ME
THAN SMOKING, THOUGH.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.660
I NEVER COULD FIGURE
OUT WHY PEOPLE DO
A THING LIKE THAT.

25:37.827 --> 25:41.038
ROLL LEAVES UP IN PAPER,
STICK IT IN THEIR FACE,
AND SET FIRE TO IT.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.791
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
POSSESSES THEM TO DO
A THING LIKE THAT?

25:47.921 --> 25:50.047
SHE'S HURTING NOW.
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.591
DID WHAT YOU HAD
TO DO, CHARLES.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.842
I KNOW.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.721
SHE JUST LOVED
THAT HORSE SO MUCH.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.851
I'M AS WORRIED
ABOUT HER AS I AM
ABOUT PA.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.396
LAURA'S BECOME
HIS WHOLE LIFE

26:05.564 --> 26:08.274
THESE LAST
FEW WEEKS,

26:08.441 --> 26:09.441
LAUGHING
AND SMILING AGAIN

26:09.609 --> 26:11.193
JUST LIKE HE DID
WHEN I WAS A KID.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.738
THEN THIS
HAD TO HAPPEN.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.951
SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HIS FACE
YESTERDAY...

26:21.454 --> 26:23.330
REMINDED ME
OF WHEN HE LOST
THE FARM.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.625
I WAS 11 OR 12
YEARS OLD,

26:26.793 --> 26:27.876
I GUESS, AND A MAN
CAME BY THE HOUSE,

26:28.044 --> 26:29.461
AND HE SAID
WE HAVE TO GET OUT.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.799
PA ASKED HIM
IF HE COULD TALK
TO HIM OUTSIDE.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.304
KEPT LOOKING OVER
AT ME, WISHING I--

26:39.973 --> 26:41.640
WISHING I WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO HEAR IT.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.686
THE MAN JUST SAID,
"THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE TO TALK ABOUT,"

26:45.854 --> 26:47.146
AND HE LEFT.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.276
MY PA JUST
STOOD THERE...

26:55.280 --> 26:56.739
AND HE GOT OLD.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.452
STANDING THERE
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

27:01.620 --> 27:05.414
AND HE...
JUST GOT OLD.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.670
I'M GOING TO GO
FOR A WALK.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.789
YOU KNOW, SITTING
THERE IN CHURCH TODAY,

27:46.956 --> 27:48.624
I GOT TO
THINKING BACK.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.586
THAT'S ONE THING
I LIKE ABOUT
SILENT PRAYING...

27:52.754 --> 27:54.088
YOU CAN TALK
TO THE LORD

27:54.255 --> 27:55.506
RIGHT THE WAY
YOU'RE FEELING,

27:55.674 --> 27:57.257
INSTEAD OF THE WAY
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL.

27:59.427 --> 28:02.971
GOT TO THINKING BACK
TO WHEN I LOST MY WIFE
AND DAUGHTER,

28:03.139 --> 28:05.808
HOW I BLAMED
GOD FOR IT.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.727
OH, I DID.
JUST FLAT OUT BLAMED HIM.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.898
DID YOU EVER BLAME
GOD FOR ANYTHING?

28:13.066 --> 28:14.400
NO.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.152
NO, I DIDN'T
FIGURE YOU DID.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.698
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
BLAMED SOMEBODY ELSE.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.658
WASN'T ANYBODY ELSE
AROUND TO BLAME.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.743
WASN'T GOING
TO BLAME ME.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.831
TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO REALIZE...

28:28.998 --> 28:32.042
WASN'T ANYBODY
TO BLAME.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.585
SOME THINGS
JUST HAPPEN.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.046
GRANDPA SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HIM DO IT.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.091
HE PROMISED ME
HE WOULDN'T LET
HIM DO IT.

28:39.259 --> 28:44.304
WELL, WE'D ALL
LIKE TO KEEP ALL
THE PROMISES WE MAKE.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.765
JUST AIN'T NO WAY
TO DO THAT...

28:47.934 --> 28:50.602
ESPECIALLY THE PROMISES
WE MAKE TO FOLKS WE LOVE.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.438
THEY'RE
THE HARDEST KIND.

28:52.605 --> 28:57.067
SEE, BECAUSE WHEN...WHEN
YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY,

28:57.235 --> 29:00.028
YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.238
THAT'S WHEN YOU
MAKE THE PROMISES

29:01.406 --> 29:02.990
THERE AIN'T NO WAY
OF KEEPING.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.076
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR GRANDPA.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.205
JUST LOVES
YOU TOO MUCH, THAT'S ALL.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.211
I'M SORRY.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.547
I DIDN'T
MEAN IT.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.760
OH, I KNOW.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.430
HEY, LOOKY HERE...

29:27.390 --> 29:29.224
I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T MEAN IT.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.518
YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T
MEAN IT.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.229
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
YOU TOLD YOUR GRANDPA?

29:35.315 --> 29:36.774
I'M GOING TO GO
TELL HIM RIGHT NOW.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.066
THAT-A GIRL.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.652
WATCH YOUR STEP.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.112
OKAY.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.518
GRANDPA!

30:34.457 --> 30:36.291
[VOICE OF GRANDPA]
MY DEAREST LAURA,

30:36.459 --> 30:38.877
I MUST ASK YOU
TO FORGIVE ME.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.380
JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.174
ALL MY LIFE
I'VE BEEN MAKING PROMISES,

30:44.342 --> 30:46.009
PROMISES I NEVER KEPT.

30:46.177 --> 30:49.012
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
I JUST DID.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.014
YOUR PA WAS RIGHT
ABOUT BUNNY.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.851
I KNEW THAT
RIGHT FROM THE START.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.061
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE
HE COULD DO.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.397
IT WAS HARD FOR HIM
BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH,

30:58.565 --> 31:01.358
BUT HE DID IT
FOR BUNNY'S SAKE.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.152
I MADE THAT PROMISE
FOR MY SAKE,

31:04.320 --> 31:05.988
LIKE I DONE ALL MY LIFE,

31:06.155 --> 31:10.409
BUT NO MORE--
GOD WILLING, NO MORE.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.702
GOOD-BYE.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.513
NO SIGN OF HIM, HUH?

31:31.681 --> 31:32.806
NO.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.516
JUST GOT BACK,
MYSELF.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.562
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NO USE
LOOKING IN THE DARK.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.984
IT'S NO USE, ANYWAY.
HE COULD HAVE GONE

31:48.197 --> 31:49.364
HE WANTS IT THIS WAY,

31:49.532 --> 31:50.949
WE'RE JUST GOING TO LET
HIM HAVE IT THIS WAY.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.160
-CHARLES, YOU CAN'T.
-CAROLINE, I MEAN IT!

31:56.205 --> 31:57.122
I MEAN IT.
IT'S HIS LIFE.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.166
HE DOES WHAT
HE PLEASES WITH IT.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.879
I'M TIRED!

YOUR MIND ABOUT
LOOKING FOR HIM.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.807
THANKS. I WOULD LIKE TO
STOP OVER IN SPRINGFIELD,

32:56.975 --> 32:58.934

TAKE THAT TRAIN.

GET UP THIS MORNING?

33:14.575 --> 33:16.368

SAY ANYTHING
LAST NIGHT?

33:18.454 --> 33:19.913

ON ACCOUNT OF BUNNY.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.042
Charles: THAT HORSE--I WISH
I'D NEVER SET EYES ON IT!

33:24.210 --> 33:25.293
TALKED TO HER
YESTERDAY.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.628
SHE SEEMED
TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THE HORSE.

33:26.796 --> 33:27.963
HOW COULD SHE UNDERSTAND
WHEN HER FATHER

33:28.131 --> 33:29.631
KILLS THE MOST PRECIOUS
THING IN HER LIFE?

33:29.799 --> 33:31.633

TO JOURNEY HOME.
