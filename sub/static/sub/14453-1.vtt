Uh-oh. Looks like the interns

00:49.226 --> 00:51.461
Hey, Kyle. What's up?

[woman] <i> The gunman was described</i>

00:57.801 --> 00:59.736
I'm right behind you.

00:59.803 --> 01:01.738
[woman] Jill, let's go.
It's time for school.

01:17.588 --> 01:20.757
Hi, stranger. [chuckles]

01:21.692 --> 01:23.627
Bye. Have fun.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.501
[elevator beeps]

01:34.338 --> 01:36.440
[smooches] Come on. Bye.

01:37.641 --> 01:40.877
So, any big plans this weekend?

01:57.260 --> 01:58.528

02:04.735 --> 02:08.705
Oh, man. Fuck you, man.

[man laughing]

02:10.907 --> 02:13.777
- Oh, fuck.
- Chad?

02:13.844 --> 02:19.449
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
That's so fucked up.

02:19.516 --> 02:21.418
- Are you Kyle?
- Yeah. Hi.

02:21.485 --> 02:24.421
The front desk says your wife is here.
Some kind of emergency.

02:24.488 --> 02:25.722
Oh, uh, thank you.

02:25.789 --> 02:27.357
[laughing]

02:31.495 --> 02:34.197
Hi. Hey, excuse me.

02:34.264 --> 02:37.501
Did my...? Is my wife here?
My name's Kyle Madison.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.936
Her name's Mary.
She said there might be some...

02:40.203 --> 02:41.748
- I'm right here. It's okay.
- Jesus! Wait.

02:41.772 --> 02:42.839
What the fuck, ma...?

02:42.906 --> 02:45.942
Oh, my God. What? Zack?

02:46.209 --> 02:47.878
- Kyle?
- What?

02:47.944 --> 02:48.945
Come here, brother.

02:49.579 --> 02:52.616
- What are you doing? How are you?
- Oh, Jesus.

02:52.682 --> 02:55.252
- Look at that. Fresh-faced.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:55.318 --> 02:58.822
Wow. This is crazy timing.
Apparently my wife is here

02:58.889 --> 03:01.691
- with some kind of emergency...
- Emergency.

03:01.758 --> 03:03.860
- Okay. Wow.
- Okay. [laughs]

03:03.927 --> 03:05.838
- Right? Come on, I got you out of school.
- Okay.

03:05.862 --> 03:08.565
- Let's go play.
- Oh, Jesus. No, man, I...

03:08.632 --> 03:13.303
[chuckles] Can you hang out in my office
for like ten, 20, 30 minutes?

03:14.237 --> 03:16.706
- I can do ten, 20.
- Okay, come on.

03:16.773 --> 03:17.941
[Kyle] <i>So, how have you been?</i>

03:18.208 --> 03:19.709
What happened to you?

03:20.210 --> 03:22.345
Uh, you know, I've...

03:22.412 --> 03:23.847
I've been. [chuckles]

03:24.714 --> 03:26.850
I mean, you, like, disappeared, man.

03:27.651 --> 03:31.755
Yeah. Well, you know, me and college
didn't really... you know?

03:31.822 --> 03:34.491
But, hey, worked out for you, right?

03:35.325 --> 03:37.728
So, what the heck are you doing here, man?

03:37.794 --> 03:39.629
Oh, I'm here to save your soul.

03:39.696 --> 03:41.898
Amazing. Save it from what?

03:41.965 --> 03:44.534
The zombies.
I mean, like, what is this place?

03:45.001 --> 03:47.471
Uh, it's an office.
Maybe you've heard of them.

03:47.537 --> 03:49.573
Yeah, I've heard of them,
but I mean, like,

03:49.639 --> 03:55.378
what does this office in particular, like,
you know, make?

03:55.846 --> 03:57.247
It's a bank.

03:57.314 --> 03:58.949
Oh, it's a bank? You're a banker?

03:59.015 --> 04:02.419
Uh, no. No, I'm not. I'm the...

04:02.486 --> 04:04.788
I'm a social media coordinator.

04:04.855 --> 04:07.691
- Oh, okay.
- It's actually... It's...

04:07.758 --> 04:10.560
It's actually kind of pretty creative.
Uh...

04:10.627 --> 04:13.764
I get to write on social media
using different personas.

04:13.830 --> 04:18.468
Like, different characters almost
for different...

04:18.535 --> 04:19.803
Okay, for example.

04:19.870 --> 04:23.640
Right now, we're doing
this, um, big Twitter campaign

04:23.707 --> 04:25.187
- for our mortgage division.
- Uh-huh.

04:25.275 --> 04:27.277
Turns out, research says that it's,
you know,

04:27.344 --> 04:30.313
it's super-hard for millennials
to get interested in mortgages

04:30.380 --> 04:32.482
because of the economy and stuff.

04:32.549 --> 04:38.288
And so it's my job to, you know,
appeal to different demographics.

04:38.355 --> 04:39.923
And, you know...

04:39.990 --> 04:42.793
Hey, you still have the Manifesto?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.394
The what?

04:44.461 --> 04:46.530
The Manifesto, man.
Don't tell me you threw it away.

04:46.596 --> 04:49.566
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you remember that.

04:49.633 --> 04:53.570
Remember? Dude, I am never gonna forget
the Manifesto as long as...

04:53.637 --> 04:54.971
Hey, what are you doing Saturday?

04:55.038 --> 04:56.940
Uh, jeez. Um...

04:57.007 --> 04:59.609
Saturday, I actually think
I have to come back in. My boss...

04:59.676 --> 05:02.879
- No, you're not. You're coming with me.
- Oh, I wish, man.

05:02.946 --> 05:04.714
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing?

05:04.781 --> 05:07.017
[chuckles] Okay, what are we doing?

05:08.051 --> 05:09.619
[makes muffled noise]

05:09.986 --> 05:11.721
[laughs]

05:11.788 --> 05:13.957
Okay. What does that mean?

05:14.691 --> 05:18.094
Okay. It means, I got into town
this morning, right? To do this...

05:18.361 --> 05:21.898
I mean, I don't know how to...
I mean, to do this really cool thing.

05:21.965 --> 05:24.568
You know? And then suddenly,
I was like, holy shit.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.036
Kyle. Kyle!

05:26.102 --> 05:28.538
Kyle lives here. I miss Kyle.

05:28.605 --> 05:30.507
I need Kyle.

05:30.574 --> 05:32.676
And, you know, I think I can get you in.

05:32.742 --> 05:34.662
And it's gonna be amazing,
and we're gonna do it.

05:34.978 --> 05:38.014
[chuckles] We're gonna do what?

05:39.883 --> 05:42.686
We're gonna have, you know, an experience.

05:42.752 --> 05:45.055
[both chuckling]

05:45.121 --> 05:46.923
Oh, no.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.825
[both laughing]

05:48.892 --> 05:52.796
Okay. Okay. What kind of experience?

05:53.530 --> 05:55.465
What kind of experience do you want?

05:57.867 --> 05:58.802
Wow.

05:58.868 --> 06:00.637
- Okay. Um...
- Right?

06:00.704 --> 06:04.507
And when does...?
Or how long does this experience take?

06:04.574 --> 06:07.110
It takes as long you want it to take.
You know what I mean?

06:08.111 --> 06:10.046
No, no, not really.

06:10.113 --> 06:12.682
Well, can you be any less specific?

06:12.749 --> 06:16.519
I cannot. And I will not say another word
until you agree to come.

06:16.586 --> 06:19.689
Oh, man, Zack.

06:19.756 --> 06:22.525
- I missed you, man. [chuckles]
- I missed you, man.

06:22.592 --> 06:26.096
Why couldn't you have given me,
like, any notice?

06:26.763 --> 06:30.834
Kyle, I really want you
to do this with me.

06:31.901 --> 06:36.406
What if I said it was like a workshop?

06:37.607 --> 06:40.977
Like a motivational workshop? Wha...?

06:41.044 --> 06:42.412
Okay.

06:44.414 --> 06:46.082
[phone rings]

06:46.149 --> 06:47.484

06:47.951 --> 06:49.085
Hey, Chad.

06:49.953 --> 06:52.756
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're coming with me, all right?

06:52.822 --> 06:54.591
It's 100 bucks.
I can front you the money...

06:54.658 --> 06:56.035
I mean, I don't have a credit card.

06:56.059 --> 06:58.895
I don't care about the money. It's...

06:58.962 --> 07:01.665
- [Chad] Yo, Kyle, my man.
- Oh, my...

07:02.198 --> 07:05.869
What about drinks? Sunday night.
What's your number?

07:05.936 --> 07:08.838
- I don't have a number.
- You don't have a number. What?

07:08.905 --> 07:11.083
- What do you mean? You don't...?
- I don't have a number.

07:11.107 --> 07:13.610
- [Chad] Kyle?
- Um...

07:13.677 --> 07:15.812
Okay. Sit down. Sit down, all right?

07:15.879 --> 07:18.648
- And I will be right back.
- Okay.

07:18.715 --> 07:20.183
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- Okay.

07:31.094 --> 07:33.964
- Hey, Chad. Did you...?
- One sec, bud.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.565
You're fucking me.

07:36.199 --> 07:38.668
Oh, you are fucking me.

07:38.735 --> 07:40.070
- Chad?
- Ha-ha!

07:40.136 --> 07:43.506
- You're so fucking me right now, man.
- All right, I got a friend, but...

07:43.573 --> 07:45.775
Stop it. Fuck you.

07:45.842 --> 07:47.110
[Chad laughing]

07:47.177 --> 07:50.246
[Chad] Fuck you, man.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.248
You're fucking killing me.
What'd she say?

08:28.284 --> 08:29.285
[treadmill beeps]

08:29.552 --> 08:31.254
[panting]

09:22.172 --> 09:24.574
<i>What is Rebirth? [chuckles]</i>

09:24.874 --> 09:27.644
<i>Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.</i>

09:27.710 --> 09:31.948
<i>I think Rebirth,
it's about getting out of your rut.</i>

09:32.015 --> 09:34.784
<i>It's about getting in touch with yourself.</i>

09:35.151 --> 09:36.252
<i>With your body.</i>

09:36.319 --> 09:39.355
[man] <i>We live in</i>
<i>a "one life fits all" culture.</i>

09:39.622 --> 09:43.059
<i>And Rebirth dares you
to find the life for you.</i>

09:43.126 --> 09:46.129
<i>It's fun. It's fast. It's furious.</i>

09:46.196 --> 09:48.164
<i>It's crazy. It's a blast.</i>

09:48.231 --> 09:51.267
[woman 1] <i> People talk about the high</i>
<i>that they get when they climb Everest.</i>

09:52.202 --> 09:55.638
<i>I don't need Everest. I have Rebirth.</i>

09:55.705 --> 09:58.374
[woman 2] <i> I'm the last person</i>
<i>to do something like this.</i>

09:58.641 --> 10:02.345
<i>But Rebirth opened me up to men,
to sensuality.</i>

10:02.612 --> 10:04.013
<i>To experimentation.</i>

10:04.080 --> 10:07.283
[woman 3] <i> My first Rebirth, I didn't go</i>
<i>with anyone. I was all by myself.</i>

10:07.350 --> 10:11.287
<i>And so I was really nervous
and kind of shy and in my shell.</i>

10:11.354 --> 10:16.359
<i>And by the end, I just felt
so much more confident in myself.</i>

10:16.626 --> 10:20.997
<i>And I had had some of the most intense</i>

10:21.064 --> 10:23.933
<i>sensual experiences of my life.</i>

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey.

10:25.301 --> 10:27.637
Hey. Hey.

10:27.704 --> 10:30.673
- You coming to bed?
- Yeah, in a minute.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.642
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

10:32.709 --> 10:33.810
Uh...

10:33.877 --> 10:38.648
Just looking through this old stuff.

10:38.715 --> 10:43.119
Hey, guess who came to work today
out of nowhere. Zack.

10:43.753 --> 10:44.921
Zack who?

10:45.855 --> 10:48.658
You know, Zack. From college.

10:49.359 --> 10:51.161
[chuckles] Oh.

10:51.227 --> 10:53.429
That guy? Was he a student there?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.132
Yeah. What do you mean?

10:56.199 --> 10:57.200
Huh.

10:57.267 --> 11:00.370
- He was wild.
- Yeah, I guess.

11:00.436 --> 11:02.038
So, what'd he want?

11:03.873 --> 11:08.111
Nothing, I mean, you know,
he just wanted to say, "What's up? Hi."

11:09.879 --> 11:10.980
Okay.

11:21.157 --> 11:22.692
Hey, hon?

11:25.728 --> 11:26.930
Hey.

11:27.931 --> 11:31.000
You know how you're always taking
these girls' weekends?

11:56.125 --> 11:57.125
[sighs]

11:58.861 --> 12:00.330
Uh...

12:00.463 --> 12:02.999
Excuse me. Do you know
where everybody went?

12:06.135 --> 12:07.437
Sorry.

12:15.078 --> 12:16.179
Sorry.

12:16.946 --> 12:19.082
Hey, honey, it's me.

12:19.148 --> 12:22.885
Listen, I think you were right.

12:22.952 --> 12:25.254
This thing is kind of dumb.

12:25.321 --> 12:29.759
So, I was thinking
maybe I could take Jill and...

12:31.294 --> 12:32.462
Uh...

12:33.296 --> 12:35.798
Hold... I'm sorry, babe.
Let me call you right back, okay?

12:35.865 --> 12:38.201
I'll call you right back. Love you, bye.

[chuckles] You said I didn't belong.

30:17.559 --> 30:21.196
So, I don't know,
was I not cool enough or...?

30:21.930 --> 30:24.032
Who exactly are you, anyway?

30:24.099 --> 30:26.101
Are you, like, in charge or...?

30:26.168 --> 30:28.904
Why do you think not belonging
is such a bad thing?

30:29.471 --> 30:32.507
- Isn't that the whole point?
- Whole point of what?

30:32.574 --> 30:34.976
This. Of this.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.912
The point of what?

30:38.513 --> 30:40.215
Okay. [chuckles]

30:40.282 --> 30:42.951
Okay, okay, so, is this how this works?

30:43.385 --> 30:45.153
Is this how what works?

30:45.220 --> 30:46.955
Uh... [chuckles]

30:47.022 --> 30:49.524
Is this, like, an exercise?
This whole thing?

30:49.591 --> 30:51.159
- What whole thing?
- Heh.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.196
You're not gonna stop, are you?

30:54.262 --> 30:56.431
Okay, so should I...?

30:56.498 --> 30:59.234
I'll go back to the thing now.

30:59.301 --> 31:02.337
- What thing?
- The thing.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.639
The seminar, dance party, whatev...

31:04.906 --> 31:06.975
The whole reason I'm here.

31:07.342 --> 31:09.945
Okay, okay, I'm going.

31:10.545 --> 31:12.147
So, that's the reason you're here?

31:15.217 --> 31:19.254
Well, I don't know.
Is there something else?

31:20.922 --> 31:23.024
Would you like there to be something else?

31:24.426 --> 31:26.361
I don't know. What else is there to do?

31:27.396 --> 31:29.498
What would you like to do?

31:29.564 --> 31:31.366
[chuckles]

31:31.433 --> 31:35.170
I've never been to one of these things
before. Why don't you tell me?

31:36.271 --> 31:38.940
Why don't you ask me the question
you really wanna ask?

31:40.108 --> 31:42.978
Okay, well, what is...?
What question is that?

31:43.044 --> 31:44.312
Why did I single you out?

31:44.379 --> 31:46.481
Okay, okay, why did you single me out?

31:47.149 --> 31:49.351
Why do you think I singled you out?

31:50.051 --> 31:53.221
Because I'm the new guy

31:53.288 --> 31:56.291
and you guys wanna do something to me?

31:57.592 --> 31:59.928
Do you wanna do something to me?

31:59.995 --> 32:01.630
No, no.

32:01.696 --> 32:04.666
I don't... I don't... I wasn't...

32:04.933 --> 32:06.535
I don't... I mean, what? I...

32:07.669 --> 32:09.538
Is that okay with you?

32:11.606 --> 32:13.442
Is it okay with you?

32:14.576 --> 32:17.179
Look, no, no, no, I don't...

32:17.245 --> 32:18.947
[chuckles]

32:19.014 --> 32:21.550
I mean, that depends on what you wanna do.

32:21.616 --> 32:23.518
What...

32:24.419 --> 32:26.188
...are we talking about?

32:27.255 --> 32:28.723
What's rule number two?

32:29.391 --> 32:30.959
Oh...

32:31.026 --> 32:33.462
- No leaders?
- What do you think that means?

32:34.729 --> 32:38.300
It means we can...

32:38.366 --> 32:41.269
do whatever we want.

32:44.439 --> 32:46.374
Oh, fuck. Oh, man.

32:46.441 --> 32:49.010
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

32:49.077 --> 32:52.481
I honestly don't know. I...

32:52.547 --> 32:54.616
I'm terrible at this. Please just tell me.

32:54.683 --> 32:56.418
Why don't you just say it?

32:56.485 --> 32:58.320
Is it because you don't know?

32:58.386 --> 33:00.266
Or you're afraid
that I might judge your answer?

33:02.023 --> 33:03.492
[chuckles]

33:04.092 --> 33:05.293
No...

33:06.027 --> 33:07.629
Would you like to go to the Wish Room?

33:09.164 --> 33:10.465
The what?

33:10.532 --> 33:12.767
What's the Wish Room?

33:13.034 --> 33:14.569
What do you think it is?

33:14.636 --> 33:16.571
[chuckles]

33:16.638 --> 33:21.610
I... I imagine it's a room where you make
a wish and it comes true?

33:23.044 --> 33:25.247
Is that the kind of room
that you'd like to go to?

33:26.081 --> 33:28.717
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

33:28.783 --> 33:31.319
I don't know. Who wouldn't?

33:34.256 --> 33:37.592
So, what you're saying
is that I ask you, tell you,

33:37.659 --> 33:42.497
to take me to the Wish Room
and you'd take me there?

33:43.298 --> 33:46.201
Do you think that's the way this works?

33:49.671 --> 33:51.706
Take me to the Wish Room.

35:01.343 --> 35:03.311

38:12.634 --> 38:13.968
[man 1] Be quiet.

38:19.808 --> 38:23.077
[man 1] We're all good, right? All good?

38:29.684 --> 38:30.985
Oh.

38:31.953 --> 38:34.455
Hi. Sorry. Uh...

38:34.522 --> 38:37.058
No, no, no. Come on in, please.

38:37.492 --> 38:39.961
Uh... No, I... I... I...

38:40.028 --> 38:41.930
Welcome. Join us.

38:42.664 --> 38:46.334
Okay, but I'm a fetus, I guess. [chuckles]

38:46.401 --> 38:48.036
I'm just looking for the big room.

38:48.102 --> 38:50.505
Oh, we have plenty of space in here.

38:50.572 --> 38:52.674
Please, have a seat.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.810
Right. Okay, okay. Sorry.

38:55.877 --> 38:56.945
All right.

38:57.645 --> 38:59.113
Hi. Hi.

38:59.981 --> 39:01.482
Sorry.

39:01.549 --> 39:03.051
What's your name?

39:03.117 --> 39:04.419
Uh, Kyle.

39:04.485 --> 39:05.920
Kyle.

39:05.987 --> 39:07.088
I'm Air.

39:08.022 --> 39:10.792
- Hi.
- I feel like I knew you were coming.

39:10.859 --> 39:12.894
[chuckles] Did you feel it, too?

39:13.795 --> 39:15.630
Um... Well... [chuckles]

39:16.998 --> 39:19.767
We're really glad to have you join us.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.369
Join our circle.

39:22.503 --> 39:24.839
Thank you. Great. Yeah, me too. [chuckles]

39:26.708 --> 39:29.077
Okay, everyone, relax.

39:29.143 --> 39:31.679
Close your eyes.

39:34.015 --> 39:36.117
Relax.

39:37.685 --> 39:39.754
Breathe.

39:44.058 --> 39:45.894
Breathe.

39:48.863 --> 39:51.733
Feel each other's presence.

39:54.135 --> 39:56.838
There's something else in the room,
isn't there?

39:57.605 --> 39:59.641
Does everyone else feel it?

40:01.643 --> 40:03.177
It's floating.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.079
Somewhere...

40:05.146 --> 40:06.648
over there.

40:07.815 --> 40:10.752
Over Kyle. Near the ceiling.

40:13.521 --> 40:19.127
Oh. It's a wave of pure white light.

40:20.128 --> 40:22.997
Breathe it in.

40:27.936 --> 40:29.537
[Air gasps]

40:29.604 --> 40:31.139
Something's not right.

40:34.609 --> 40:37.679
Something's not right.
I feel like it wants to hurt me.

40:37.745 --> 40:40.081
Like it's inside of me,
touching me with it's...

40:40.148 --> 40:43.651
Oh, God, who brought this thing in here?!

40:44.218 --> 40:45.720
[man] You okay?

40:47.088 --> 40:50.625
- It's okay. It's okay, what's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

40:52.126 --> 40:54.062
I lost the connection.

40:55.730 --> 40:58.499
I'm so sorry. I'm trying so hard.

40:58.866 --> 41:00.468
Don't be sorry. Let's explore that.

41:00.535 --> 41:01.636
When did you lose it?

41:02.837 --> 41:04.172
Mmm.

41:06.607 --> 41:08.676
Well, I think I might know the answer.

41:09.711 --> 41:11.512
You mind if I say it?

41:14.482 --> 41:16.884
Was it when this asshole burst in here
like a wet fart?

41:21.522 --> 41:23.791
[Kyle] Wait. Wha...?

41:24.559 --> 41:27.962
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's over, okay?

41:28.029 --> 41:29.530
Come on, come on.

41:29.597 --> 41:30.732
There you go, there you go.

41:30.798 --> 41:33.835
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- I am so sorry.

41:33.901 --> 41:36.104
Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat, okay?

41:36.170 --> 41:37.572
There you go.

41:38.673 --> 41:41.776
- Hey, I'm sorry. I...
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.

41:41.843 --> 41:43.745
It's okay. You're okay, right, Air?

41:43.811 --> 41:47.081
See? See? No one got punched in the face.

41:47.148 --> 41:49.951
All right? Let's reboot. Not restart.

41:51.019 --> 41:52.253
It's good.

41:53.588 --> 41:54.989
Okay, so...

41:56.290 --> 41:58.860
How about we try it again? Yup?

41:59.560 --> 42:00.595
[clears throat]

42:02.764 --> 42:05.199
Kyle? You wanna give it a shot?

42:06.034 --> 42:09.771
- I don't know what you guys are doing.
- Don't worry, no one's gonna bite.

42:10.772 --> 42:11.973
Stand up.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.275
- Come on, stand up.
- Sorry.

42:14.876 --> 42:16.878
There you go.

42:17.612 --> 42:20.214
[exhaling]

42:22.150 --> 42:23.818
There you go. Are you good?

42:23.885 --> 42:25.405
- Yeah, I'm... Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.088
Okay, come on.

42:33.928 --> 42:35.863
- All right.
- Sorry.

42:35.930 --> 42:37.098
Go ahead.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.035
What do you want me to do?

42:41.702 --> 42:43.337
Just go for it.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.006
Go ahead and lead us.

42:46.674 --> 42:48.076
Okay, I...

42:48.142 --> 42:50.745
Sorry, I'm not supposed
to be here now, so...

42:50.812 --> 42:53.347
You're not supposed to be here now?

42:54.816 --> 42:59.020
Yeah, yeah, no. I was with the...

42:59.087 --> 43:02.790
Or I missed the end of the orientation,
so I think I'm...

43:02.857 --> 43:05.993
Uh, I'm supposed to be, you know...

43:06.060 --> 43:08.996
This is, like, an advanced group, right?

43:09.063 --> 43:11.732
Wow. Mm.

43:11.799 --> 43:13.768
Someone wanna tell me
where the advanced group is?

43:13.835 --> 43:15.236
That sounds pretty cool.

43:17.004 --> 43:20.044
What do they teach in the advanced group?
How to walk through walls and shit?

43:22.110 --> 43:23.277
Okay.

43:23.978 --> 43:26.347
- You want me to leave?
- Why are you asking me?

43:27.315 --> 43:29.717
This is like an exercise, right?

43:30.651 --> 43:33.321
This is like an exercise? No.

43:34.055 --> 43:35.189
No.

43:35.790 --> 43:37.125
This is reality.

43:38.626 --> 43:41.896
Are you supposed to be here or not?
You tell me. I've never fucking met you.

43:46.801 --> 43:47.835
Okay.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.041
I'm gonna... Excuse me.

43:54.108 --> 43:57.778
Hey, hey, hey, relax. Relax, come here.

43:57.845 --> 44:00.948
I'm just fucking with you
to make a point, okay?

44:01.749 --> 44:03.384
You are supposed to be here, Kyle.

44:03.651 --> 44:06.354
Please, stay with us. [chuckles]

44:06.420 --> 44:08.356
- You're supposed to be here, okay?
- Okay.

44:08.422 --> 44:10.324
Okay, sit down. Come on.

44:10.391 --> 44:12.260
Come on, sit down. You're good, come on.

44:12.326 --> 44:13.794
There you go.

44:13.861 --> 44:16.764
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

44:16.831 --> 44:19.066
That's okay, man.

44:20.735 --> 44:23.037
[grunting]

44:23.104 --> 44:24.739
Oh, what happened? Someone hit you?

44:25.206 --> 44:26.941
The fuck?!

44:27.008 --> 44:30.178
Or it's just an exercise.
So, what do you do when someone hits you?

44:30.244 --> 44:31.445
You just take it like that?

44:31.712 --> 44:34.081
Fuck, man,
you can't just fucking hit people!

44:34.148 --> 44:35.349
Why not?

44:36.717 --> 44:39.787
Anyone else think their ego trumps
the death of the universe?

44:39.854 --> 44:41.956
You can leave any time.

44:42.023 --> 44:44.825
What about you, Spielberg?
You getting enough for your spank reel?

44:44.892 --> 44:48.362
Let me out now!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

44:48.429 --> 44:51.065
Everything was just fine
till you showed up. Wasn't it, gang?

44:51.999 --> 44:53.935
- I don't need this.
- You don't need what?

44:54.001 --> 44:56.737
I don't need whatever bullshit test
you're teaching, man.

44:56.804 --> 44:58.372
Don't you fucking listen to anything?

44:58.439 --> 45:00.308
There are no teachers here.

45:00.374 --> 45:02.810
- I'm not gonna hit you, man.
- What?

45:02.877 --> 45:05.913
[chuckles] Why would I want you to hit me?

45:05.980 --> 45:08.849
Is that how you get hard?
You make Daddy spank you?

45:09.250 --> 45:12.320
- Oh, no, what's going on? No one there?
- God.

45:12.386 --> 45:14.155
Maybe they want you here for a reason.

45:14.956 --> 45:16.791
Why don't you sit the fuck down
next to Air

45:16.857 --> 45:19.217
and she can tell you more about
what angel dicks taste like.

45:22.330 --> 45:24.432
Really nice, guys.
You just let this guy bully you?

45:24.498 --> 45:28.102
They're here to admit
that consciousness is a mistake.

45:28.169 --> 45:31.939
- Not take over class on day one.
- Oh, whatever.

45:33.240 --> 45:34.375
Jesus Christ!

45:36.477 --> 45:39.380
You got a seriously fucked up life, man.
I almost felt bad for you.

45:39.447 --> 45:42.083
Cute wife.
You think you were her first choice?

45:43.017 --> 45:45.152
Wow, look at those guys. Nice polo.

45:45.219 --> 45:47.521
- These guys even alive?
- How did you get these?

45:47.788 --> 45:50.434
"Hey, guys, totally got the hookup
from National First on my mortgage.

45:50.458 --> 45:53.928
Hashtag "first time homeowner,"
hashtag "woot," hashtag "YOLO."

45:54.328 --> 45:59.266
Wow. Really good to see that $80,000
creative writing MFA isn't going to waste.

45:59.333 --> 46:01.068
How did you get these?

46:02.470 --> 46:05.006
- Is that my phone?
- Technically,

46:05.072 --> 46:07.108
until the end of the weekend,
it's our phone.

46:07.174 --> 46:09.477
- Give me that back.
- This isn't really a phone, is it?

46:09.543 --> 46:13.014
- This is the key to his prison cell.
- Oh, my fucking God.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.516
Wow. You see that?
You see how worked up he's getting?

46:15.783 --> 46:19.120
- I believe that's what we call a red flag.
- You stole my phone.

46:19.186 --> 46:23.024
You gave this
to total strangers willingly!

46:24.859 --> 46:27.194
This has got your entire life
on here, man.

46:29.397 --> 46:32.099
Pictures of your daughter, your wife.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.502
- Fuck.
- Layout of your house.

46:34.568 --> 46:36.937
Home addresses of friends and family.

46:38.139 --> 46:41.842
The passwords of your security systems
and bank accounts

46:41.909 --> 46:45.112
just saved in your e-mail folder,
like an idiot.

46:46.113 --> 46:48.049
You don't even have a passcode on this.

46:48.516 --> 46:50.117
Hey, hey, no...

46:50.184 --> 46:53.454
It's okay. Dude, it is okay.

46:53.521 --> 46:55.122
I'm as bad as you.

46:55.923 --> 46:58.292
We all are, aren't we?

46:59.060 --> 47:00.161
This?

47:01.495 --> 47:05.299
This is not reality.
None of the shit on here is real.

47:09.270 --> 47:10.404
That's reality.

47:11.839 --> 47:13.240
This...

47:14.141 --> 47:16.277
...is just silicon and air.

47:22.850 --> 47:23.984
Let me out.

47:24.051 --> 47:27.188
- Oh, come on. It's over, let's be friends.
- I wanna leave right now.

47:29.857 --> 47:31.492
Don't you listen to anything?

47:32.860 --> 47:34.862
You can go any time you want.

47:40.234 --> 47:41.569
There's the door.

47:54.348 --> 47:55.649
Namaste.

47:57.518 --> 47:59.453
All right,
everybody take off your clothes.

48:02.990 --> 48:04.091
[groans]

48:10.564 --> 48:12.600
Fucking goddamn it.

48:14.401 --> 48:15.536
Fuck.

48:18.606 --> 48:20.474
Oh, fuck!

48:21.976 --> 48:23.410
[sighs]

48:41.962 --> 48:43.564
[grunting]

48:44.598 --> 48:47.668
- Can we help you?
- [Kyle] How do I get out of here?

48:47.935 --> 48:49.679
Are you feeling all right?
You look a little...

48:49.703 --> 48:53.207
Hey, hey. Hold on one second.
Are you sure you feel all right?

48:53.274 --> 48:56.510
Just show me how to get out
of this dungeon.

48:57.044 --> 48:59.346
Oh. I think it's this way.

48:59.413 --> 49:02.316
I'm Todd, by the way. You're Kyle, right?

49:02.383 --> 49:03.984
How do you know my name?

49:04.051 --> 49:07.254
You're the one that Ray picked on
in his speech, right?

49:07.321 --> 49:08.561
Hey, don't feel bad about that.

49:08.589 --> 49:11.225
He always tries
to throw you off-balance your first time.

49:11.292 --> 49:14.195
- It's sort of an honor.
- Just show me how to get out of here.

49:14.261 --> 49:16.997
Cool, cool. Yeah, right this way.

49:20.334 --> 49:23.737
Can I just say something, Kyle?
Kyle, if I may.

49:24.004 --> 49:25.172
- Breathe.
- I am.

49:25.239 --> 49:27.074
No, no, really take a second.

49:27.141 --> 49:30.244
You know, calm your body and just breathe.

49:30.311 --> 49:31.591
Breathe? You want me to breathe?

49:31.645 --> 49:36.016
A guy fucking punched me,
threw a chair, broke into my phone.

49:36.083 --> 49:38.686
Wow.
Okay, was he trying to make a point or...?

49:38.752 --> 49:40.287
I don't care.

49:41.255 --> 49:43.224
I know where you're coming from, man.

49:43.290 --> 49:45.593
- Yeah, Rebirth, it's intense.
- Fuck.

49:45.659 --> 49:47.595
I washed out my first three tries.

49:47.661 --> 49:50.197
And it took me four years
before I came back.

49:50.264 --> 49:54.368
Lost everything in those four years.
My job, my credit, my house.

49:54.435 --> 49:57.304
My two girls wouldn't even talk to me
because I couldn't face the things

49:57.371 --> 49:59.240
that Rebirth was trying to get me
to confront.

49:59.306 --> 50:02.509
- I don't care.
- Can I just say?

50:02.576 --> 50:05.779
The whole point of Rebirth, basically,

50:06.513 --> 50:08.582
is to find what you need,
not what you want.

50:08.649 --> 50:12.586
And sometimes, what you need, Kyle,
not super-pleasant.

50:12.653 --> 50:15.089
I don't need any of this.

50:15.155 --> 50:17.691
Fair enough,
but you know if you walk into a room

50:17.758 --> 50:20.194
and it's too heavy for you,
you just leave.

50:20.261 --> 50:21.621
That's what you're supposed to do.

50:21.662 --> 50:24.565
See, everybody needs something different,
so every room is different,

50:24.632 --> 50:26.567
but you gotta keep opening those doors.

50:26.634 --> 50:28.168
He broke into my phone.

50:28.235 --> 50:29.470
And it stays in the room.

50:29.536 --> 50:30.704
Everything stays in the room.

50:30.771 --> 50:33.440
Just show me where the exit is.

50:35.442 --> 50:38.345
I think I know where you were. Yeah.

50:38.412 --> 50:41.649
Can I just say,
it's not gonna get worse than that?

50:41.715 --> 50:43.550
Unless you want it to. Can I say that?

50:43.617 --> 50:45.286
Is the shuttle out there?

50:46.186 --> 50:47.621
You're already here, man.

50:47.688 --> 50:51.358
It's more interesting
than, what, a night of TV?

50:51.425 --> 50:53.294
And don't forget about Zack.

50:54.561 --> 50:55.729
You know Zack?

50:55.796 --> 50:58.699
Of course I know Zack. I love Zack.

50:58.766 --> 51:00.334
So, Zack is here?

51:00.668 --> 51:03.203
Uh... [groans]

51:03.270 --> 51:05.372
I don't think I can actually say that.

51:05.439 --> 51:07.107
You don't? It's easy.

51:07.174 --> 51:09.576
He's either here or he's not. Yes or no.

51:09.643 --> 51:13.814
No, but not no as in he's not here.
No as in...

51:15.449 --> 51:18.652
I can't break the spoiler rule, man.

51:18.719 --> 51:20.120
- Fuck.
- Okay, look.

51:20.187 --> 51:22.089
Look, look, look. Wait, wait, wait.

51:22.690 --> 51:24.758
You're not supposed to find him yet.

51:24.825 --> 51:29.530
And if he were here,
theoretically... you will.

51:29.596 --> 51:30.664
Maybe.

51:30.731 --> 51:31.832
[groans]

51:32.099 --> 51:33.167
I wish I could say more.

51:33.233 --> 51:36.670
I have no idea what you're talking about.

51:36.737 --> 51:37.838
Okay.

51:39.340 --> 51:41.241
Off the record.

51:41.308 --> 51:44.111
There are no leaders here, man.

51:44.178 --> 51:48.716
Zack is doing his Rebirth
just like everybody else.

51:48.782 --> 51:53.287
Just like everybody else.

51:53.887 --> 51:56.623
And when you're supposed to find him...

51:58.692 --> 52:01.595
I'm gonna take you to a room
you're gonna love, okay?

52:01.662 --> 52:04.465
Spoiler curtain down.
You are gonna love it.

52:04.531 --> 52:07.134
Man to man, no cameras, no bullshit.

52:07.768 --> 52:09.336
You're gonna love this room.

52:11.572 --> 52:13.607
Hey, guys. This is Kyle.

52:13.674 --> 52:15.476
He's a good friend of Zack's.

52:15.542 --> 52:18.445
- [woman] Hi, Kyle.
- I love Zack.

52:18.512 --> 52:21.482
[man] Welcome, Kyle. I'm Gabriel.

52:21.548 --> 52:22.750
Call me Gabe.

52:23.317 --> 52:25.152
Come. Join us.

52:29.490 --> 52:32.493
This is Kyle's first Rebirth.
He's feeling a little overwhelmed.

52:32.559 --> 52:34.762
He could really use
some unconditional love.

52:35.863 --> 52:37.564
Leave the door open.

52:37.631 --> 52:38.842
Whatever makes you comfortable.

52:38.866 --> 52:42.269
If anybody fucks with me again,
I will call 911.

52:42.336 --> 52:43.771
[all chuckle]

52:44.772 --> 52:45.839
Deal.

52:55.282 --> 52:56.850
[Gabe] Mm.
[woman] Mm.

52:56.917 --> 52:58.752
- Welcome.
- Hi.

52:58.819 --> 53:00.954
Okay. That's all right. Hi.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.322
[Gabe] Kyle.

53:02.389 --> 53:04.525
This circle is about honesty.

53:04.591 --> 53:08.629
It's about saying whatever's on your mind
right now, in the moment.

53:11.231 --> 53:12.466
Okay.

53:13.400 --> 53:17.538
Kyle, I feel like you're really nervous
right now.

53:17.604 --> 53:18.939
Yeah, well...

53:19.740 --> 53:20.874
Yeah, yeah.

53:20.941 --> 53:22.342
[Gabe] That's okay, that's okay.

53:22.409 --> 53:26.513
Just tell us what you're thinking
at this moment.

53:26.580 --> 53:29.483
Now... be honest.

53:31.518 --> 53:33.687
Okay. Uh...

53:33.754 --> 53:37.758
I think this whole Rebirth thing
is pretty fucked up.

53:38.792 --> 53:40.227
[woman 1] Mm.
[woman 2] Hmm.

53:40.294 --> 53:41.395
[Gabe] Hm.

53:41.462 --> 53:44.398
[all] Mm.

53:44.465 --> 53:46.900
I remember feeling the exact same way.

53:48.802 --> 53:51.405
- I totally empathize.
- Okay, thank you.

53:51.939 --> 53:54.441
Is there something you wanna share
with the group?

53:54.508 --> 53:57.277
Nope, nope. Everything's good.

53:57.344 --> 54:00.013
It's all great. Everything's great.
Thank you, that's fine.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.882
Thank you. Carry on.

54:03.517 --> 54:05.319
You know, I don't...

54:05.385 --> 54:07.754
I don't feel like you're being honest.

54:08.455 --> 54:09.923
I don't feel like that, either.

54:11.391 --> 54:13.527
Yeah, well, what do you want?

54:13.594 --> 54:15.562
All we want is honesty.

54:15.629 --> 54:18.832
Now, if you have
to say something negative...

54:19.833 --> 54:20.968
...just be honest about it.

54:23.003 --> 54:24.304
Okay.

54:24.872 --> 54:27.274
I think this is a fucking joke.

54:27.341 --> 54:31.311
I think you're all a bunch
of arrogant assholes

54:31.378 --> 54:34.848
who think you're superior
to everyone because... [chuckles]

54:34.915 --> 54:36.984
I don't know, you're so open-minded,

54:37.050 --> 54:39.353
it'd be okay if someone shot you
in the face?

54:39.853 --> 54:43.390
And I'm fucking pissed I wasted a day
I could've spent with my kid

54:43.457 --> 54:46.059
doing this hippie bullshit my friend,

54:46.326 --> 54:49.963
who I don't even really know is my friend,
tricked me into.

54:50.030 --> 54:52.399
And I don't know what this is,

54:52.466 --> 54:54.635
but I wouldn't be surprised
if you dick-sacks

54:54.701 --> 54:56.770
are stealing my identity right now.

54:56.837 --> 54:58.338
And I wanna go home.

54:58.405 --> 55:00.607
Is that honest enough for you, Gabe?

55:06.580 --> 55:09.383
I just wanna say
that I'm really connecting

55:09.449 --> 55:12.519
to what Kyle is feeling right now.

55:12.586 --> 55:14.054
Me too.

55:14.321 --> 55:16.690
[Gabe]
What's making you feel connected to Kyle?

55:17.558 --> 55:22.629
I guess, his honesty
about feeling like he doesn't belong,

55:22.696 --> 55:24.998
because I was feeling that way, too.

55:25.999 --> 55:28.068
And I'm glad that someone
just came in here

55:28.335 --> 55:30.571
and called everyone on their bullshit.

55:30.637 --> 55:31.805
[Gabe] Mmm.

55:31.872 --> 55:33.106
Kyle.

55:33.373 --> 55:34.808
How do you feel about that?

55:36.643 --> 55:39.413
Uh, good, I guess.

55:40.113 --> 55:44.885
I'm feeling, like,
a lot of anger out of you.

55:45.485 --> 55:48.689
But, like, a lot of life, too,

55:48.755 --> 55:53.427
- and I don't know, um... vitality?
- [Gabe] Mm.

55:54.127 --> 55:58.999
- And I'm kind of really drawn to that.
- [woman 3] Me too.

55:59.066 --> 56:06.006
Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling
like this tractor beam of male energy...

56:06.073 --> 56:09.076
that I haven't felt anywhere else
this weekend.

56:09.142 --> 56:11.411
Can I say something weird?

56:11.478 --> 56:13.614
Just stay in the moment.

56:15.115 --> 56:19.486
I feel like,
I go to these kinds of things a lot,

56:19.553 --> 56:22.155
and I meet a lot of guys
who wanna be here.

56:23.624 --> 56:27.394
But I never meet guys
who should be here...

56:28.895 --> 56:30.597
...until now.

56:30.664 --> 56:35.435
And this is probably terrible
to say about a first-timer, but...

56:37.504 --> 56:38.905
I probably shouldn't say it.

56:40.007 --> 56:42.909
Just... tell the truth.

56:47.047 --> 56:49.016
When I look at Kyle...

56:50.617 --> 56:51.652
...I see this...

56:52.986 --> 56:56.556
...huge, angry...

56:57.057 --> 56:59.660
...erect cock.

57:00.193 --> 57:03.030
[women chuckling]

57:04.965 --> 57:06.867
[all chuckle]

57:07.567 --> 57:10.070
Do you feel threatened by the cock?

57:12.806 --> 57:14.942
How does the cock make you feel?

57:17.210 --> 57:18.612
Happy.

57:22.883 --> 57:24.217
Intrigued.

57:25.852 --> 57:26.852
Okay.

57:27.187 --> 57:28.789
Horny.

57:30.023 --> 57:31.023
[Gabe] Kyle.

57:32.059 --> 57:33.927
How do you feel hearing this?

57:33.994 --> 57:35.662
Uh...

57:36.029 --> 57:37.864
I... It...

57:38.999 --> 57:42.502
Good. This... I mean, it's nice.
Thank you.

57:42.569 --> 57:45.472
- [Gabe] Is that all?
- I, uh... Um...

57:46.039 --> 57:47.474
I don't know.

57:47.874 --> 57:53.046
Do you feel any shame having these women
tell you how they feel about you?

57:53.113 --> 57:54.113
No, no.

57:56.650 --> 57:58.151
No, no, no.

57:58.218 --> 57:59.720
I don't know, I don't know.

57:59.786 --> 58:02.255
Oh, good, good. Stay with that.

58:02.522 --> 58:04.057
How about you, Betty?

58:04.791 --> 58:08.495
What do you feel about Kyle right now?

58:08.562 --> 58:11.198
I'm starting to feel really turned on.

58:12.866 --> 58:16.603
I just wanna say that I'm feeling this...

58:18.705 --> 58:22.943
...amazing spontaneity
in the room right now.

58:23.010 --> 58:24.177
[all chuckle]

58:26.847 --> 58:32.219
I feel like we're all
on the same wavelength...

58:33.086 --> 58:34.688
...of breaking through our inhibitions

58:34.755 --> 58:37.524
and doing something really crazy,
don't you, guys?

58:37.591 --> 58:38.825
[all chuckling]

58:38.892 --> 58:43.263
Do you feel like you're waiting
for someone to take the first step?

58:45.599 --> 58:47.200
- Kind of.
- [Gabe] Mm.

58:48.735 --> 58:50.170
Kind of.

58:50.237 --> 58:51.237
Man.

58:52.305 --> 58:55.308
[Gabe] All right.
Now I wanna check back in with Kyle.

58:56.209 --> 58:57.544
Kyle.

58:58.612 --> 58:59.780
Kyle.

59:00.147 --> 59:01.815
How are you feeling?

59:01.882 --> 59:03.316
Do you feel safe?

59:04.951 --> 59:06.887
Uh, heh...

59:07.854 --> 59:09.289
Yeah?

59:09.556 --> 59:14.161
[Gabe] Uh, you know that felt more
like a question than an answer.

59:15.028 --> 59:17.264
- Do you still wanna go home?
- Uh...

59:17.330 --> 59:18.331
[Gabe] Hmm?

59:18.598 --> 59:20.033
[man] Hello?!

59:20.700 --> 59:21.868
[Gabe] Kyle.

59:22.803 --> 59:26.339
What would you like
to have happen in this room?

59:26.606 --> 59:29.209
- [man] Hello?!
- I don't know, I don't...

59:30.043 --> 59:31.078
Not sure.

59:31.144 --> 59:32.879
[man] Hello?

59:34.114 --> 59:35.715
[Gabe] Betty?
[man] Hello?

59:36.583 --> 59:39.252
What do you want Kyle to do right now?

59:40.187 --> 59:41.955
I want Kyle to fuck me.

59:42.022 --> 59:43.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:45.258 --> 59:47.694
[man] Please, please.
[Gabe] Kyle, do you wanna do that?

59:48.662 --> 59:50.964
[man] Somebody help me! Please.

59:51.031 --> 59:52.933
I, uh... What is...?

59:52.999 --> 59:55.802
- [man] Please, somebody help me!
- Who is that? What is that?

59:55.869 --> 59:58.071
[man] You fucking sick motherfuckers!

59:58.138 --> 01:00:00.774
All right, does anybody...?
Do you hear...? Is that a thing?

01:00:00.841 --> 01:00:01.841
Is that part of this?

01:00:02.709 --> 01:00:05.812
Why do you think that person
is your responsibility?

01:00:05.879 --> 01:00:08.348
[man] This is so fucked up!

01:00:08.615 --> 01:00:11.952
All right, all right, all right.
Jesus. Jesus Christ.

01:00:12.018 --> 01:00:13.620
- [woman] I know, right?
- Who is that?

01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:16.723
Do you think
that man's needs trump your own?

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.293
What is this? Is this part of this?
Is this part of the thing?

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.896
You can't return to the same place twice.

01:00:22.963 --> 01:00:24.931
[man] I'm being held against my will!

01:00:24.998 --> 01:00:26.199
[Kyle] Jesus.

01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:28.635
[man] Held against my will!

01:00:29.236 --> 01:00:30.937
Anybody. Anybody, please.

01:00:31.004 --> 01:00:32.405
Who is that?

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:35.809
- [man] Can anybody fucking hear me?
- Hello?

01:00:35.876 --> 01:00:37.177
What the fuck?

01:00:37.244 --> 01:00:40.080
- Hello?
- [man] Oh, God, please!

01:00:41.948 --> 01:00:43.016
What the hell is going on?

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:45.152
What do you think is going on?

01:00:45.218 --> 01:00:47.120
- [man] Is someone out there?
- Who is that?

01:00:47.187 --> 01:00:49.923
- Who do you think it is?
- Stop. Stop.

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:52.425
- Stop with that shit!
- Stop what?

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.995
[man] Anybody, please. Anybody.

01:00:55.061 --> 01:00:56.830
Kyle, please stop. He's fine.

01:00:56.897 --> 01:00:58.899
- Open the door!
- [man] Is someone out there?

01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:02.135
Okay, it's not what it looks like.
He knows he can quit any time.

01:01:02.202 --> 01:01:04.137
[man] Hello?!

01:01:04.204 --> 01:01:06.039
Hello? Hello?

01:01:06.106 --> 01:01:07.340
Goddamn it, is this real?!

01:01:07.407 --> 01:01:10.343
Okay, the man behind this door is
at a very delicate phase of his Rebirth.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.413
- Shut up. I don't wanna hear it!
- Okay, just stop.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.682
I never told you about my life
before Rebirth.

01:01:15.749 --> 01:01:17.017
I don't care.

01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:18.818
I could tell you I was a drug addict.

01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:20.925
I could tell you that my kid
was taken away from me.

01:01:20.954 --> 01:01:23.790
I could tell you anything,
but it doesn't matter.

01:01:23.857 --> 01:01:26.693
What matters is I'm not the same person
I used to be.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.264
- [man] Please.
- I don't even know your name, lady.

01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:32.331
Kyle!

01:01:35.468 --> 01:01:38.738
Okay, I know this looks crazy,
but he actually needs this.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.042
Jesus, Zack.

01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:43.343
- Zack?
- Stop talking to him.

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.170
- We need help.
- What are they doing to you?

01:01:45.212 --> 01:01:47.814
It's okay. I don't want you
to talk to him. We're getting help...

01:01:47.881 --> 01:01:49.816
- Get out of here!
- It's okay, sweetie...

01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:51.318
Shut up!

01:01:54.254 --> 01:01:55.388
[grunts]

01:01:59.326 --> 01:02:01.928
Okay. I'm gonna get you down, all right?

01:02:02.729 --> 01:02:04.431
Jesus. Fuck.

01:02:06.499 --> 01:02:08.034
Okay.

01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:09.421
All right, all right, hold still.

01:02:10.403 --> 01:02:12.239
Oh, I can feel your belly.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.375
What the fuck happened to your pants, man?

01:02:15.442 --> 01:02:17.944
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What the hell are you laughing at?

01:02:18.011 --> 01:02:19.212
God.

01:02:19.279 --> 01:02:20.480
What the fuck did they do...?

01:02:20.747 --> 01:02:21.748
- Oh, fuck.
- Careful.

01:02:21.815 --> 01:02:23.883
One of those buckets is my bathroom.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.252
What?

01:02:25.318 --> 01:02:28.822
Hey, did I, like, tell you
how much it means to me

01:02:28.888 --> 01:02:30.499
- that you came this weekend?
- Put this on.

01:02:30.523 --> 01:02:33.093
- Okay? Put this on.
- Is it time? Is it T-shirt time?

01:02:33.159 --> 01:02:35.895
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's T-shirt time.
Come on, come on.

01:02:36.496 --> 01:02:38.331
Jesus Christ.

01:02:38.398 --> 01:02:40.200
What are these, man?

01:02:40.267 --> 01:02:41.434
Are these branding marks?

01:02:41.501 --> 01:02:43.870
Those are my Rebirths, man.

01:02:43.937 --> 01:02:46.006
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:46.072 --> 01:02:47.841
Jesse's trying...

01:02:47.907 --> 01:02:51.011
Is helping break my attachments
to the domination game.

01:02:51.077 --> 01:02:53.413
To, like, the status thing.
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.882
- You're gonna put these pants on.
- No, no, no.

01:02:57.017 --> 01:02:58.885
Put the pants on. Put them on.

01:02:58.952 --> 01:03:01.087
You were just screaming for help. Why not?

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:04.057
[laughing]

01:03:04.124 --> 01:03:06.493
No, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, no, no. No.

01:03:06.559 --> 01:03:08.895
No, no, no.

01:03:08.962 --> 01:03:10.230
No, no, no.

01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:13.333
[woman] Stop hurting him!
Stop hurting him.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.435
Zack, are you okay?

01:03:15.502 --> 01:03:18.405
Where's Jesse? Is Jesse out there?
Naomi, just... Could you get Jesse?

01:03:18.471 --> 01:03:20.507
- Could you get Jesse?
- Who the fuck is Jesse?

01:03:20.573 --> 01:03:22.409
[Naomi] Jesse's coming, honey.
Hang in there.

01:03:22.475 --> 01:03:24.544
Okay, thank you, Naomi.

01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:28.048
All right, I hope you know
that I have called the police,

01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:29.282
and they are on their way.

01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:30.884
[Naomi] No, you didn't.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.352
Yes, I did.

01:03:32.419 --> 01:03:34.321
- Fuck. Hey, Kyle, Kyle, I...
- Oh, fuck.

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:35.588
[Zack squeals]

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:36.855
Stop it.

01:03:37.424 --> 01:03:41.027
Stop, stop, stop. What's wrong with you?

01:03:41.094 --> 01:03:44.831
It's okay. No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:03:44.898 --> 01:03:46.933
It's my supplements.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.536
- Are they drugging you?
- No, no. Not drugs.

01:03:49.602 --> 01:03:51.504
They're supplements.

01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:53.373
My God. You're not gonna hurt Jesse,
are you?

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.518
- You're not gonna hurt Jesse.
- You're drugging him?

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:57.911
How long have you been with these people?

01:03:57.977 --> 01:03:59.512
- Uh...
- Huh?

01:03:59.579 --> 01:04:02.615
That I don't... Because we jump
around a lot, you know what I mean?

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.918
Because Je... Have you met Jesse?

01:04:04.984 --> 01:04:06.553
Who the fuck is Jesse?

01:04:06.619 --> 01:04:09.622
- [Naomi] Jesse's almost here.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.391
Because this is my friend.

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:13.293
This is my best friend, Naomi.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.394
Oh, God. Wait, wait.

01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:16.363
You're not... Hold on. I hope the money...

01:04:16.429 --> 01:04:19.332
- Is the money...? Are you mad about...?
- What do you mean?

01:04:19.399 --> 01:04:20.567
What money?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.402
[slamming on door]

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:23.937
What money?

01:04:24.003 --> 01:04:27.374
Jesse says that money
is just a construct, too.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.142
- So, it's fine, it's fine.
- No, no, no.

01:04:29.209 --> 01:04:31.177
They didn't make you give them your money.

01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:33.279
No, no, no, not my money.
Your money. [chuckles]

01:04:34.047 --> 01:04:37.083
What do you mean, my money?
What are you talking about?

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.451
What does he mean, my money?

01:04:38.518 --> 01:04:40.987
[Naomi] You shouldn't be talking
to him right now, asshole.

01:04:41.054 --> 01:04:43.957
What do you mean, my money?
What have you done?

01:04:44.023 --> 01:04:46.202
- What did you freaks do to my money?
- You're doing it!

01:04:46.226 --> 01:04:49.396
What did you do?
What have you done to me?

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:51.398
What did I...? What...?

01:04:51.464 --> 01:04:54.067
[man whistles]

01:04:54.134 --> 01:04:56.469
[man] Zachariah, are you there?

01:04:57.103 --> 01:04:58.304
- Jesse!
- Okay, why are...?

01:04:58.371 --> 01:04:59.371
Come on.

01:05:00.974 --> 01:05:02.642
- Jesse.
- Aah!

01:05:03.643 --> 01:05:05.345
[grunting]

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.549
- I come in peace.
- Aah!

01:05:09.616 --> 01:05:11.418
No, Kyle, no!

01:05:11.484 --> 01:05:14.254
- No!
- Zachariah, stop it.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.523
Your friend can't help it.
He's not a Birthling.

01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:18.258
What did we talk about?

01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:20.293
Your friend is not a Birthling.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.996
You can't be expecting him
to have the insight...

01:05:23.062 --> 01:05:26.433
Sir, I believe in a peaceful revolution
through massage and the...

01:05:26.499 --> 01:05:29.936
Stop it!
Stop with your brainwashing bullshit.

01:05:30.003 --> 01:05:32.972
I'm not listening. I can't hear you.

01:05:33.039 --> 01:05:35.975
What the fuck is this, huh?

01:05:37.243 --> 01:05:40.947
Cupcakes? What the fuck is going on?! Aah!

01:05:41.014 --> 01:05:42.982
- [Zack] Jesse! Jesse!
- No, no, no.

01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:45.385
No, we've seen your friend.
Now we're leaving.

01:05:45.452 --> 01:05:46.619
No, no, no. Let him help you.

01:05:46.686 --> 01:05:49.422
Tell me what your body's feeling.
Tell me what your body's feeling.

01:05:49.489 --> 01:05:52.392
- Please, please.
- Every cell in your body has been trained

01:05:52.459 --> 01:05:55.261
by millions of years of evolution
to fight, to survive.

01:05:55.328 --> 01:05:57.163
What you're feeling now is real life.

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:58.264
Don't you feel it?

01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.433
[Jesse] You're just not used
to such a pure dose.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.435
Your mind's reacting.

01:06:02.502 --> 01:06:07.974
Shut up. My friend was shitting
in a bucket, screaming for help!

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.009
[Zack] No, no, you're hurting Jesse.

01:06:10.076 --> 01:06:12.455
- [Naomi] Knock it down, knock it down.
- That was real. Do it again.

01:06:12.479 --> 01:06:13.680
[banging on door]

01:06:13.746 --> 01:06:15.582
- No, no, hit me again, please.
- Do it again.

01:06:15.648 --> 01:06:17.250
- Stop it.
- No, hit me.

01:06:17.317 --> 01:06:18.751
- Shut up.
- Hit me again.

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:20.529
- [Naomi] Just knock it down!
- Stay out!

01:06:20.553 --> 01:06:22.455
- Stay out!
- Knock it down!

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:24.490
Hit me again.

01:06:25.225 --> 01:06:27.360
- They're coming!
- Back off, I'll do it.

01:06:27.427 --> 01:06:30.463
I'll fucking do it.
Come on, Zack, let's go.

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:33.066
It's okay, it's okay, Kyle, okay?

01:06:33.132 --> 01:06:35.435
- We still love you.
- [Jesse] Zack?

01:06:35.502 --> 01:06:38.037
Kyle's the master now. Do what he says.

01:06:38.104 --> 01:06:39.239
- [Zack] Okay.
- This is it.

01:06:39.305 --> 01:06:41.307
- Can you feel it?
- [laughs] Yes, I can feel it.

01:06:41.374 --> 01:06:43.243
Shut up!

01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:46.079
Back off. Zack, let's go, move.

01:06:46.145 --> 01:06:48.248
All right, everybody back off,
or I will kill him!

01:06:48.314 --> 01:06:49.749
Do it, man. Do it.

01:06:50.016 --> 01:06:51.451
Shut up, man!

01:06:51.518 --> 01:06:54.654
- Go, go. Get back, get back.
- Okay, okay, no one's gonna get hurt.

01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:58.558
- Kill me now, master. I'm ready to ascend.
- That's enough, Jesse. Stop it.

01:06:58.625 --> 01:06:59.526
[laughing]

01:06:59.592 --> 01:07:02.328
I think we got a situation here.
You need to kill that footage now.

01:07:02.395 --> 01:07:03.395
Go.

01:07:04.364 --> 01:07:06.466
[Kyle] Where do we go? Do we go down?

01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:08.468
Where the fuck do we go? Zack!

01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:10.303
[Naomi] We got a breach!

01:07:11.137 --> 01:07:12.171
Breach!

01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:15.074
[Naomi] Okay, Zack, I need to know
what you've told him.

01:07:15.141 --> 01:07:19.646
Don't talk to her, Zack, all right?
He didn't tell me nothing, okay?

01:07:19.712 --> 01:07:22.215
We just wanna get on that shuttle
and go home.

01:07:22.282 --> 01:07:23.716
Where the fuck is the exit?!

01:07:23.783 --> 01:07:26.219
Sir, sir, you know
this is not real, right?

01:07:26.286 --> 01:07:29.088
- Shut up, shut up.
- Okay, all right, what's your name?

01:07:29.155 --> 01:07:31.391
- What's his name?
- Kyle-something.

01:07:31.457 --> 01:07:33.826
- This guy is having a psychotic episode.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:35.973
- Can we get a doctor over here, please?
- Yeah.

01:07:36.062 --> 01:07:37.697
[Kyle] How do you get out of here?

01:07:37.764 --> 01:07:40.667
Hey, honey, the exit is this way,
where it's always been.

01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:42.168
Found a doctor.

01:07:43.536 --> 01:07:45.772
Okay, sir, can we just stop moving
for a second?

01:07:45.838 --> 01:07:47.574
[Naomi] Okay, everyone. Just stay calm.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.676
[doctor] Sir, what's your name?

01:07:49.742 --> 01:07:50.810
- What's his name?
- Kyle.

01:07:51.077 --> 01:07:52.388
- It's Kyle.
- [doctor] Okay, Karl.

01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:55.481
I'm a psychiatrist at First Memorial.
I'm here for the seminar, like you.

01:07:55.548 --> 01:07:58.551
You just tell him to stop
whatever the fuck he's trying to do.

01:07:58.618 --> 01:08:01.120
- Just let us go, all right?
- No... No problem.

01:08:01.187 --> 01:08:04.157
Some people's brains have a hard time
adjusting to Rebirth.

01:08:04.223 --> 01:08:06.225
So, just breathe.

01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:08.412
They're trying to lock you back
in their cage, master.

01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:10.105
- Don't listen to them.
- [Naomi] Shut up, Jesse.

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:12.841
- [man 1] I think he went to the Wish Room.
- Yes, he did. I took him there.

01:08:12.865 --> 01:08:15.568
- [man 1] Jesus Christ.
- That's it. That's the door.

01:08:15.635 --> 01:08:17.837
- That's the door.
- Are you sure?

01:08:18.104 --> 01:08:19.738
- Stand back, stand back.
- [man 2] Stay.

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:22.241
- Easy.
- Open the door, Zack.

01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:25.645
Get over here and open the fucking door.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.183
- It's locked.
- [doctor] Listen.

01:08:30.249 --> 01:08:33.152
If you go back into the real world
without decompressing,

01:08:33.219 --> 01:08:34.763
you're gonna have
a serious brain damage...

01:08:34.787 --> 01:08:37.590
- [Kyle] Shut up!
- It's not a door. It's a wall.

01:08:37.657 --> 01:08:39.359
It's a window, open it.

01:08:39.425 --> 01:08:43.462
Shut up! Everyone shut up
and just let me think!

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:45.331
[panting]

01:08:48.234 --> 01:08:51.337
[Kyle grunting]

01:08:53.606 --> 01:08:56.274
[panting]

01:08:56.876 --> 01:08:59.645
No. Hey, Karl, Karl, don't do it, man.

01:08:59.712 --> 01:09:02.749
Karl, don't do it, man.
Don't do something you're gonna regret.

01:09:02.814 --> 01:09:04.792
- [man] Come back home.
- It's a stupid thing to do.

01:09:04.817 --> 01:09:06.185
It's a stupid thing to do.

01:09:06.252 --> 01:09:08.421
- Karl, don't do it...
- Shut up!

01:09:10.857 --> 01:09:14.160
Nobody fucking move.

01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:16.662
Zack.

01:09:17.697 --> 01:09:19.298
Let's go.

01:09:19.365 --> 01:09:21.768
Zack, let's go.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.173
All right, move.

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:33.712
[Kyle] Hello?

01:09:35.548 --> 01:09:37.316
Hello?!

01:09:39.652 --> 01:09:41.354
Hello?!

01:09:45.558 --> 01:09:47.894
Oh, my God.
I'm so fucking hard right now.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.595
God, fuck.

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:51.698

01:10:42.849 --> 01:10:44.717
[speaking indistinctly]

01:10:46.552 --> 01:10:48.254
It's okay, really.

01:10:50.323 --> 01:10:53.259
- What's going on?
- That's not funny.

01:10:53.326 --> 01:10:54.994
What the fuck is going on?

01:11:03.736 --> 01:11:05.571
Told you, man.

01:11:06.472 --> 01:11:07.540
Zack!

01:11:07.607 --> 01:11:10.409

Oh, shit, man. [laughing]

01:12:00.827 --> 01:12:02.562
Hey, everybody.

01:12:02.929 --> 01:12:05.631

What some of you may not know
is that this man...

01:12:22.481 --> 01:12:23.883
...is like a brother to me.

01:12:25.985 --> 01:12:31.591
And what you may also not know,
is that this guy right here,

01:12:31.657 --> 01:12:33.860
is one of the main inspirations...

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.530
...for all of this. Huh?

01:12:37.597 --> 01:12:39.832

I think this motherfucker

[all laugh]

01:13:01.787 --> 01:13:04.957

01:14:45.858 --> 01:14:47.193
I'm so sorry.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.696
I don't wanna talk to this guy.

01:18:07.693 --> 01:18:09.271
<i>If you like to return to the same place...</i>

01:18:09.295 --> 01:18:10.996
What the fuck?!

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:15.401
Jesus. Jesus Christ.

01:18:15.467 --> 01:18:17.736
<i>Hey, buddy, do you mind?
I said, do you mind?</i>

01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:19.281
<i>We got a lot of options to get through.</i>

01:18:19.305 --> 01:18:21.340
<i>If you believe existence ends
at brain death,</i>

01:18:21.407 --> 01:18:23.108
<i>- press...</i>
- Who is this?

01:18:23.175 --> 01:18:24.810
What are you doing?!

01:18:24.877 --> 01:18:28.013
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't get your answer.
If you'd like to leave Rebirth...</i>

01:18:32.284 --> 01:18:35.854
No. No. No.

01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:40.993
What the fuck?!

01:18:45.464 --> 01:18:46.865
Oh, my...

01:18:48.133 --> 01:18:49.133
[yells]

01:18:49.168 --> 01:18:51.770
No. No. No.

01:18:51.837 --> 01:18:52.838
No!

01:18:52.905 --> 01:18:54.473
[panting]
[water splashes]

01:19:10.823 --> 01:19:13.158
Hey, there's my guy. Got a towel, man?

01:19:13.225 --> 01:19:16.161
Jesus, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:19:16.228 --> 01:19:19.965
[grunts] Man, you know,
after one of these weekends,

01:19:20.032 --> 01:19:22.167
it feels, like, a tour in Kabul, man.

01:19:22.234 --> 01:19:24.503
I need me, like, a nice hot soak.

01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:28.073
My wife is coming home. This is my house!

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.844
I know. It's nice, man.
Really digging the Jacuzzi.

01:19:32.311 --> 01:19:33.311
No towel?

01:19:36.515 --> 01:19:37.916
[whistles]

01:19:38.984 --> 01:19:42.021
- Hey, guy, you need any help with that?
- What have you done?

01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:45.391
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're not finished.

01:19:45.457 --> 01:19:49.561
Fuck you. This, this is over.

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:51.439
Come on.
There's an after party at Jesse's.

01:19:51.463 --> 01:19:54.800
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:19:54.867 --> 01:19:57.903
Oh, my God is right.
I mean, those sheets are amazing.

01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:02.808
- What's the thread count on those?
- Mary is gonna be home. Any second.

01:20:02.875 --> 01:20:04.209
What else did you do?

01:20:04.276 --> 01:20:06.845
I didn't do anything.
I've been in the bath the whole time.

01:20:07.546 --> 01:20:09.348
Hey, man, do you mind
if I put some tunes on?

01:20:09.415 --> 01:20:12.885
I already guessed the Wi-Fi password
was "Mumford." Heh.

01:20:19.091 --> 01:20:20.326
[groans]

01:20:20.392 --> 01:20:23.495
- Check it out, dude, you made the cover.
- Oh, fuck.

01:20:24.129 --> 01:20:26.598
Stop. Just stop. Stop it. Stop!

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:29.134
Why are you trying to destroy my life?

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:31.236
I'm not trying to destroy your life, man.

01:20:31.303 --> 01:20:34.573
I'm trying to save your life.
I'm here to help you.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.408
I don't want your help!

01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:38.610
Oh, fuck!

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:41.046
What do you people want from me?

01:20:41.113 --> 01:20:45.184
We want you to stop living your life
like a spectator, okay?

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:47.052
[sobs]

01:20:47.119 --> 01:20:49.121
That's it? You all done?

01:20:49.988 --> 01:20:51.590
All out of fight?

01:20:51.857 --> 01:20:53.425
What the fuck happened to you, man?

01:20:53.492 --> 01:20:57.129
Fuck the man. Keep it real.
Don't be boring.

01:20:57.196 --> 01:21:01.467
- What? What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you!

01:21:01.533 --> 01:21:04.069
I'm talking about your dogma, dude.

01:21:04.136 --> 01:21:08.607
The Manifesto? Your words?
Do they mean anything to you anymore?

01:21:08.874 --> 01:21:13.445
Oh, my God. You mean, do I believe
in a thing we wrote as a joke

01:21:13.512 --> 01:21:16.882
when we were 20 years old on shrooms?

01:21:16.949 --> 01:21:18.384
[chuckles]

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:22.354
Yeah. It wasn't a joke. And you know it.

01:21:22.421 --> 01:21:25.090
Stop. Stop it, all right? Just stop.

01:21:25.157 --> 01:21:27.893
Just tell me what you want
before Mary comes home.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.461
I wanna help.

01:21:29.528 --> 01:21:32.498
- You're destroying my life!
- You're destroying your life!

01:21:32.564 --> 01:21:37.069
You're destroying it!
You sit all day at a job you fucking hate.

01:21:37.569 --> 01:21:40.472
You bilk young kids out of money,
so they're so immersed in debt

01:21:40.539 --> 01:21:43.409
that they're enslaved to the system
for the rest of their fucking lives.

01:21:43.475 --> 01:21:46.645
You can't get a boner, dude.
And you know what the worst part is?

01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:50.416
You're really boring.

01:21:51.316 --> 01:21:55.154
You're a child. I'm not 20 anymore.

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.689
Thank you. I know. I am a child.

01:21:57.956 --> 01:22:01.126
So, that way, I can see the world
for what it really is,

01:22:01.193 --> 01:22:04.263
unlike the way the zombies
have conditioned you to see it.

01:22:04.329 --> 01:22:06.698
The zombies? I'm an adult.

01:22:06.965 --> 01:22:09.568
I have a family. It's a fucking job!

01:22:09.635 --> 01:22:13.272
Right, and I bet the only way
to keep your child from starving

01:22:13.338 --> 01:22:15.140
is lying for a bank!

01:22:15.207 --> 01:22:18.977
You have this juvenile obsession
with what?

01:22:19.044 --> 01:22:21.280
Am I the guy who created this system
you hate...?

01:22:21.346 --> 01:22:24.316
I don't give a fuck about the system,
okay? I care about you.

01:22:24.383 --> 01:22:25.984
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Yeah.

01:22:26.051 --> 01:22:29.354
- I can tell.
- Not this you, okay? Not this you.

01:22:29.421 --> 01:22:30.656
The you you used to be.

01:22:30.722 --> 01:22:34.359
- Before the fucking lobotomy.
- I like my life.

01:22:34.426 --> 01:22:39.431
Oh, do you like your life? I like my life.
You should fucking love your life, Kyle.

01:22:39.498 --> 01:22:41.467
You should've seen your eyes.

01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:45.037
You should've seen your eyes
when I described this weekend to you.

01:22:45.103 --> 01:22:48.607
It was like I was offering you,
like, a drop of water

01:22:48.674 --> 01:22:51.109
and you were just dying of thirst.

01:22:51.176 --> 01:22:53.979
No. I didn't know what it was.

01:22:54.046 --> 01:22:56.148
It was called Rebirth!

01:22:56.215 --> 01:22:57.683
What'd you think that meant, huh?

01:22:57.749 --> 01:23:00.285
It means being born again.

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:01.687
It means a new life.

01:23:01.753 --> 01:23:06.325
And that also, Kyle, means
killing the old one, you understand?

01:23:06.391 --> 01:23:08.994
This is also why we had to drain
your savings account.

01:23:09.061 --> 01:23:12.264
No, no, no. That was not real.
That was a fake site.

01:23:12.331 --> 01:23:13.565
Mm.

01:23:13.632 --> 01:23:15.400
It was real. It's all real.

01:23:16.101 --> 01:23:17.603
[car horn honking]

01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:20.706
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:23:20.772 --> 01:23:23.375
- Just relax. Relax. Relax.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:23.442 --> 01:23:27.312
Nothing is gonna happen, Kyle, okay?
I'm gonna set you free.

01:23:27.379 --> 01:23:28.499
All right, what do you want?

01:23:28.547 --> 01:23:31.583
How do I make this stop, all right?
What do you want from me?

01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:34.319
What do I want from you?
What do you want from you?

01:23:34.386 --> 01:23:38.090
I want the same thing.
I want you to reach enlightenment.

01:23:38.457 --> 01:23:41.527
Yes. Okay, I'll do anything you want.

01:23:41.593 --> 01:23:43.462
Just don't do this to my family.

01:23:43.529 --> 01:23:45.731
Okay, in order for it to stop...

01:23:45.797 --> 01:23:49.234
Right? You have to tell me
that you felt something at Rebirth.

01:23:49.301 --> 01:23:51.436
Yes, yes, yes, I felt something.

01:23:51.503 --> 01:23:53.505
- Okay, good. What'd you feel?
- Uh...

01:23:53.572 --> 01:23:56.108
I don't know. I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

01:23:56.174 --> 01:23:58.410
- No, no, it has to be in your own words.
- Oh, fuck.

01:23:58.477 --> 01:24:00.379
Just tell me what you wanna hear.

01:24:00.445 --> 01:24:04.249
Okay, close your eyes. Just close
your eyes and tell me the truth, brother.

01:24:04.316 --> 01:24:07.219
[panting]

01:24:07.286 --> 01:24:09.721
- I felt scared, all right?
- Good, good, good.

01:24:09.788 --> 01:24:12.391
- I felt like I was gonna die.
- Great.

01:24:12.457 --> 01:24:14.826
I feel like I've been
through a fucking war.

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.129
Yes. [laughs]

01:24:17.195 --> 01:24:18.330
[smooches]

01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:22.467
That's all I wanted to hear.
That's it. [laughs]

01:24:22.534 --> 01:24:26.538
- That's it? That's it? That's it?
- Yeah, man. You've seen the other side.

01:24:26.605 --> 01:24:28.807
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You can go back to your desk

01:24:29.074 --> 01:24:31.510
and tweet, twat, whatever the fuck
you've been doing

01:24:31.577 --> 01:24:32.844
for the rest of your life.

01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:35.714
But nobody, nobody's gonna take
the moment away from you

01:24:35.781 --> 01:24:38.383
when you held a knife
to a cult leader's throat

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.686
and busted your way out of a sex dungeon.

01:24:40.752 --> 01:24:42.654
[both laughing]

01:24:42.721 --> 01:24:43.722
- Huh?
- Right. Right.

01:24:43.789 --> 01:24:45.390
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:46.825 --> 01:24:48.694
And the sex dungeon part.

01:24:49.428 --> 01:24:52.097
- That's over, too, right?
- It's over.

01:24:52.598 --> 01:24:54.299
I promise.

01:24:54.366 --> 01:24:57.569
- [Mary] Hello.
- Hey, we're in here.

01:24:57.636 --> 01:24:59.137
I promise, man.

01:24:59.204 --> 01:25:00.706
Okay?

01:25:00.772 --> 01:25:02.774
You just gotta make a little donation.

01:25:05.811 --> 01:25:07.446
[gasps]

01:25:07.512 --> 01:25:09.114
Zack.

01:25:09.181 --> 01:25:11.116
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

01:25:11.183 --> 01:25:14.686
[Zack] Oh, man. Is this crazy or what?

01:25:14.753 --> 01:25:17.255
- Oh, boy.
[Mary] So crazy. Wow.

01:25:17.322 --> 01:25:20.158
Look at you. Oh, man, you look amazing.

01:25:20.225 --> 01:25:21.760
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha.

01:25:21.827 --> 01:25:24.863
- You guys look sweaty.
- Oh, yeah.

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:26.298
We're guys.

01:25:26.365 --> 01:25:28.400
- How long's it been?
- I don't know.

01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:31.269
I mean, long enough for you
two lovebirds to have a little one, right?

01:25:31.336 --> 01:25:33.271
- Right. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:35.374
Hey, Jill, come meet Mom and Dad's friend.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.845
No, no, no, wait. No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay. Zack was just about to leave.

01:25:39.911 --> 01:25:43.148
- Whoa. No, no, no, I'm dying to meet her.
- Yay. Let me get her.

01:25:43.215 --> 01:25:47.252
- Great. Wow, she's looking good, man.
- What do you mean, a donation?

01:25:47.319 --> 01:25:49.755
You know, a meaningful donation.
I mean, we are a non-profit.

01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:51.690
- Like money?
- Yeah, money's good.

01:25:51.757 --> 01:25:54.793
- How much money?
- Some money from your bank would be nice.

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.162
I don't have access to my bank's money.

01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:58.530
Oh, sure you do.

01:25:58.597 --> 01:26:01.433
I write tweets to idiots
who follow a bank on Twitter.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.877
- I don't have acc...
- All you gotta do

01:26:02.901 --> 01:26:05.570
is log on to your bank's server
from your computer, okay?

01:26:05.637 --> 01:26:07.239
The algorithm will do the rest.

01:26:07.305 --> 01:26:09.441
- What algorithm?
- Don't worry about it.

01:26:09.508 --> 01:26:11.877
Her Highness is on her way down.
[chuckles]

01:26:13.478 --> 01:26:16.348
Hey, so, I watched some of the videos
from Rebirth.

01:26:16.415 --> 01:26:17.415
What?

01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:19.685
Just the ones that you e-mailed me.

01:26:19.751 --> 01:26:20.886
What? E-mailed?

01:26:21.653 --> 01:26:23.889
Yeah, with the testimonials or whatever.

01:26:23.955 --> 01:26:26.458
It actually looked kind of intriguing.

01:26:26.525 --> 01:26:28.860
- You're not supposed to do that.
- Oh, no.

01:26:28.927 --> 01:26:30.262
No, no, it's okay.

01:26:30.328 --> 01:26:32.540
Hey, hey, look, as long
as we're breaking the rules here,

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:35.801
- I have some video of your boy.
- Oh!

01:26:35.867 --> 01:26:38.303
- No, no, no.
- Wait, I wanna see it.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:41.740
It's... It's embarrassing, really.

01:26:41.807 --> 01:26:46.311
Right, and you can't share
the weekend with outsiders.

01:26:46.378 --> 01:26:47.813
Oh, wow.

01:26:47.879 --> 01:26:51.717
- It already sounds like a cult.
- No, it's not a cult.

01:26:51.783 --> 01:26:53.518
[both laugh]

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:55.587
I hear Kyle says
that you guys go to a church.

01:26:55.654 --> 01:26:56.588
[Mary] Yeah, we do.
- Yeah?

01:26:56.655 --> 01:26:58.966
Oh, I mean, you guys should like...
I mean, you should come.

01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:01.493
You know, they like people
from, like, all different kinds

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.760
- of, you know, spiritual paths.
- She's not interested.

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:05.864
Actually, I don't know.

01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:08.400
If you guys both really liked it,

01:27:08.467 --> 01:27:10.669
- I'd be open-minded about it.
- She's not interested.

01:27:11.236 --> 01:27:13.672
She's not gonna do it, okay?
Just leave us alone.

01:27:14.873 --> 01:27:16.341
Kyle.

01:27:16.908 --> 01:27:18.744
I think it's time you should leave.

01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:20.779
Are you sure?

01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:24.349
[Jill] Hey.
[Kyle] Hey. Hey.

01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:26.618
Hey, sweetie! Jill, this is Zack.

01:27:26.685 --> 01:27:28.920
Hi, Jill, it's so nice to meet you.

01:27:28.987 --> 01:27:32.991
You are as beautiful
as your mother. [laughs]

01:27:33.258 --> 01:27:35.994
Hey. Does anybody want any Kool-Aid?

01:27:36.261 --> 01:27:38.630
There's still plenty left over
from the seminar. Huh?

01:27:38.697 --> 01:27:40.832
- Sure, that'd be good.
- Yeah.

01:27:40.899 --> 01:27:43.869
I know when I was a kid, I loved Kool-Aid.

01:27:43.935 --> 01:27:45.670
Kids still like Kool-Aid,
don't they, Jill?

01:27:45.737 --> 01:27:47.606
- Okay.
- Yummy.

01:27:47.672 --> 01:27:50.709
- Hey, she's not thirsty.
- Kyle, what are you doing?

01:27:50.776 --> 01:27:54.379
- What are you doing?
- I'll do it, okay?

01:27:55.347 --> 01:27:57.849
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

01:27:57.916 --> 01:27:59.751
[Mary] Kyle, what's going on here?

01:27:59.818 --> 01:28:01.052
No, this is...

01:28:01.319 --> 01:28:04.589
This is over, all right?
All right, I'll do it.

01:28:05.357 --> 01:28:06.358
Um...

01:28:06.424 --> 01:28:08.593
I think Kyle had kind of an intense day,

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.763
and I think he just needs
a little decompression time.

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:15.333
Oh. Uh...

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.903
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I was...
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

01:28:17.969 --> 01:28:21.640
It's all right. It's all right.
It's not a big deal, okay?

01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:28.046
Just stop talking.

01:28:29.381 --> 01:28:34.619
All right. Well, how about us guys
take a little retreat to the man cave?

01:28:34.686 --> 01:28:37.455
If that's okay with you young ladies?

01:28:37.522 --> 01:28:39.491
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

01:28:39.558 --> 01:28:42.761
Well, fantastic, let's do it, bud.

01:28:42.828 --> 01:28:43.762
[Kyle] It's all right.
[Jill] Bye.

01:28:43.829 --> 01:28:45.697
So nice to meet you.

01:29:00.745 --> 01:29:01.980
[Kyle exhales]

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:06.017
[Zack] Hey.

01:29:06.084 --> 01:29:09.588
So, Naomi's gonna shoot
a little testimonial video,

01:29:09.654 --> 01:29:11.523
if that's okay with you.

01:29:18.763 --> 01:29:21.399
So, I wanna be clear.

01:29:21.466 --> 01:29:24.769
I'm not going to get in trouble, right?

01:29:24.836 --> 01:29:27.672
Of course not. You're my friend.

01:29:29.841 --> 01:29:31.643
Are you sure?

01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:37.816
We will never take enough
to get detected, okay? I promise.

01:29:43.455 --> 01:29:46.758
This is a good thing, Kyle.

01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:50.762
You have an insane amount of potential.

01:29:50.829 --> 01:29:54.132
You're gonna be an integral part
of this community.

01:29:55.734 --> 01:29:59.004
You're gonna run our new Media
and Communications Department.

01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:02.040
You're gonna help us reach
a whole new group of people.

01:30:04.809 --> 01:30:07.912
Help us make this something really big.

01:30:07.979 --> 01:30:09.914
Help me, Kyle.

01:30:11.516 --> 01:30:12.684
Help us.

01:30:12.751 --> 01:30:15.720
Help yourself. [chuckles]

01:30:15.787 --> 01:30:18.490
Have some fun for once in your life.

01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:21.593
I mean, the worst case scenario...

01:30:22.193 --> 01:30:24.129
...is you make a ton of money.

01:30:25.463 --> 01:30:27.666
Dude, I guarantee you,

01:30:27.732 --> 01:30:30.502
in five years, you're gonna think

01:30:30.568 --> 01:30:34.172
this is the greatest thing
that ever happened to you.

01:30:36.041 --> 01:30:39.044
And... if you don't...

01:30:40.745 --> 01:30:42.781
...you can leave any time you want.

01:30:56.695 --> 01:30:59.831
[Kyle] <i> You know, before I found Rebirth,</i>
<i>I was lost.</i>

01:30:59.898 --> 01:31:01.132
<i>I really was.</i>

01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:06.671
<i>And the worst thing
was I didn't know I was lost.</i>

01:31:07.872 --> 01:31:10.875
<i>I was bottled up,</i>

01:31:10.942 --> 01:31:13.645
<i>and it would come out
in the dumbest ways.</i>

01:31:13.712 --> 01:31:17.916
<i>Just basic stuff,
like getting impatient with my wife,</i>

01:31:17.982 --> 01:31:21.119
<i>or spending all day long
looking at my phone,</i>

01:31:21.186 --> 01:31:23.688
<i>and then getting mad in traffic.</i>

01:31:24.255 --> 01:31:27.092
[Mary] <i>Kyle was a great husband,</i>

01:31:27.158 --> 01:31:29.994
<i>a great father, a great provider.</i>

01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:33.565
<i>Um, but he just... He wasn't happy.</i>

01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:35.633
<i>And it affected all of us.</i>

01:31:36.234 --> 01:31:39.270
<i>I was living this default life</i>

01:31:39.537 --> 01:31:42.941
<i>that everyone around me assumed
was the best life possible.</i>

01:31:43.007 --> 01:31:44.576
<i>But it just...</i>

01:31:45.944 --> 01:31:49.547
<i>...wasn't making me happy.</i>

01:31:51.182 --> 01:31:54.185
<i>And then I found Rebirth.</i>

01:31:54.753 --> 01:31:57.555
Hi, my name is Kyle Madison,

01:31:57.622 --> 01:32:00.592
and I wanna tell you my Rebirth story.

01:32:03.661 --> 01:32:07.665
{\an8}Oh, yeah. I remember Kyle's first time
at Rebirth. He was like...

01:32:09.033 --> 01:32:13.838
{\an8}<i>You know, he was like, "What the hell</i>
<i>did I just get myself involved in?"</i>

01:32:13.905 --> 01:32:15.874
[Jesse]
<i>It was almost like watching a game show</i>

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.710
where you already know that
the contestant's won a million dollars,

01:32:18.777 --> 01:32:20.044
but they don't know yet.

01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:21.846
Kyle.

01:32:21.913 --> 01:32:24.215
His first time, you know, he was so sweet.

01:32:24.282 --> 01:32:26.584
He was so open and fragile.

01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:31.122
I just wanted to give him
a massive Rebirth hug and be his mommy.

01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:36.594
{\an8}Everyone who was there was like,
"Yup, scared that one off." [laughing]

01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:40.999
{\an8}I mean, I honestly never thought
I was gonna see this guy ever again.

01:32:43.268 --> 01:32:44.836
{\an8}[sighs]

01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:51.142
{\an8}Hi, my name's Kyle Madison,
and I just finished my first Rebirth.

01:32:54.112 --> 01:32:55.180
{\an8}Is that all right?

01:32:55.246 --> 01:32:57.782
[man] <i>The next weekend, he comes back.</i>

01:32:57.849 --> 01:33:00.852
So, I'm like, "Okay."

01:33:00.919 --> 01:33:04.088
Weekend after that,
we were in Cincinnati and Kyle flies in.

01:33:04.155 --> 01:33:08.760
And, you know, that was it, that's when
I knew that this guy was totally hooked.

01:33:08.827 --> 01:33:11.596
I mean, his Z.W. potentials just exploded.

01:33:13.298 --> 01:33:17.202
Kyle had been on my team
for, like, five years, I think.

01:33:17.268 --> 01:33:19.637
But he was one of those guys
who's always in the back.

01:33:19.704 --> 01:33:24.175
A nice guy,
but never really initiated, you know?

01:33:24.242 --> 01:33:26.811
Uh, but then, one Monday morning,

01:33:26.878 --> 01:33:31.983
he came in, and it was like bam!
You know? [laughs]

01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:33.218
Who is this guy?

01:33:33.284 --> 01:33:36.154
Suddenly, I had Mark Zuckerberg
working for me, you know?

01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:39.023
- Kyle's the man.
- The man's a god.

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:41.626
It just brings clarity. That's all.

01:33:41.693 --> 01:33:43.995
There's the world before Rebirth
and the world after.

01:33:44.062 --> 01:33:47.665
Everything unimportant just falls away.

01:33:47.732 --> 01:33:52.403
You look at the world
and you just see reality.

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.305
Just like that.

01:33:54.372 --> 01:33:57.375
He's killing everyone
with his perspectives.

01:33:57.642 --> 01:33:59.377
Just murdering them.

01:33:59.644 --> 01:34:03.882
And finally, I was like,
"Hey, what's the secret?" You know?

01:34:03.948 --> 01:34:08.686
{\an8}And he looks at me, and he says,
"What are you doing this weekend?"

01:34:08.753 --> 01:34:10.021
{\an8}Give it up for Chad!

01:34:10.088 --> 01:34:12.090
[all cheering]

01:34:14.259 --> 01:34:15.393
[laughing]

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.961
Right?

01:34:17.028 --> 01:34:18.229
I knew he'd love it.

01:34:18.296 --> 01:34:21.933
Pretty soon, the whole team loved it.
Then the whole company loved it.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.001
[chuckles]

01:34:23.067 --> 01:34:26.437
We're basically the Rebirth branch
of Wall Street now.

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.042
What Rebirth did for me was...

01:34:33.144 --> 01:34:37.682
It didn't just show me how to escape
the cage I'd built around myself...

01:34:38.716 --> 01:34:44.722
...it actually showed me
that the cage existed in the first place.

01:34:44.789 --> 01:34:47.025
[Kyle] <i> The first time</i>
<i>my wife did her own Rebirth,</i>

01:34:47.091 --> 01:34:49.994
<i>I was a little nervous, I'll admit.</i>

01:34:50.061 --> 01:34:54.866
[chuckles] But that's because I was
clutching on to these zombie ideas

01:34:54.933 --> 01:34:58.436
of control, mastery
and conditioned attachments.

01:34:58.703 --> 01:35:01.272
<i>And what you learn is
your marriage only hits the stratosphere</i>

01:35:01.339 --> 01:35:03.908
<i>when you're both free to fly.</i>

01:35:03.975 --> 01:35:05.944
What people don't realize is Rebirth

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:09.314
is not just something you do
one weekend a month.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.249
It's a lifestyle.

01:35:11.316 --> 01:35:12.884
Right, Jill?

01:35:12.951 --> 01:35:15.987
We want our friends to do it.
We want our parents to do it.

01:35:16.054 --> 01:35:18.957
<i>Our nanny, our neighbors.
We definitely want our pastor to do it.</i>

01:35:19.023 --> 01:35:20.959
[Mary] <i>I want my brother to do it.</i>

01:35:21.025 --> 01:35:23.094
<i>- I want my mailman to do it.</i>
- [Kyle] <i>Ha-ha-ha.</i>

01:35:23.161 --> 01:35:25.763
I couldn't wait to get our kids to do it.

01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:30.802
Sometimes you're there to help
a couple fetuses burst out of the womb

01:35:30.868 --> 01:35:32.370
and find the warrior within.

01:35:32.437 --> 01:35:35.807
Sometimes, you think you're there
to deliver the fetus,

01:35:35.873 --> 01:35:39.777
only to find out you're the fetus
and they're there for you.

01:35:39.844 --> 01:35:43.081
It's like every time you go to Rebirth,
you're a different person.

01:35:43.147 --> 01:35:45.216
So every Rebirth's different.

01:35:45.283 --> 01:35:48.753
You never know what you're gonna find
behind a new open door.

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.988
It's not just the workshops.

01:35:50.054 --> 01:35:53.291
It's not just the Phase Two
Life Activation Experience.

01:35:53.358 --> 01:35:54.959
It's also the products.

01:36:01.432 --> 01:36:04.135
[Mary] <i> We don't even use the word "sell"</i>
<i>in Rebirth.</i>

01:36:04.202 --> 01:36:07.205
<i>Because once you realize
how much better Rebirth's products are</i>

01:36:07.271 --> 01:36:11.109
<i>than what you get in the store,
it just... It sells itself.</i>

01:36:11.175 --> 01:36:13.544
[Kyle] <i>It's healthy.</i>
<i>It's natural. It's good.</i>

01:36:13.811 --> 01:36:15.980
<i>None of this processed crap.</i>

01:36:16.314 --> 01:36:20.284
[Mary] <i> Jill is at an age</i>
<i>where she's so picky about what she eats</i>

01:36:20.351 --> 01:36:24.222
<i>and she loves the stuff.</i>

01:36:24.288 --> 01:36:26.257
<i>I don't know what they put in it.</i>

01:36:26.324 --> 01:36:28.860
- Tell them your first Rebirth, babe.
- Oh, yeah.

01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:33.264
[Kyle]
<i>Heh. You weren't breathing properly.</i>

01:36:33.331 --> 01:36:36.367
You can breathe with your nose,
you can breathe with your mouth.

01:36:36.434 --> 01:36:38.970
But there are other ways to breathe.

01:36:39.037 --> 01:36:43.841
<i>Everybody knows
there are no leaders at Rebirth,</i>

01:36:43.908 --> 01:36:45.410
<i>because only you...</i>

01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:47.945
...can change your life.

01:36:49.113 --> 01:36:52.583
But... [chuckling]

01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:56.888
But we all know who that spark was.

01:36:56.954 --> 01:36:58.823
[crowd cheering]

01:37:01.993 --> 01:37:06.464
Zack 110 percent changed Kyle's life.

01:37:07.331 --> 01:37:08.533
And mine too.

01:37:10.468 --> 01:37:13.604
In the old days, people were afraid
something horrible would happen to them.

01:37:13.871 --> 01:37:17.041
Now they're afraid
nothing will happen to them.

01:37:17.108 --> 01:37:21.079
{\an8}If Zack hadn't come into my life
when he did...

01:37:26.851 --> 01:37:29.087
I really don't like to think about it.

01:37:29.153 --> 01:37:30.922
I really don't.

01:37:30.988 --> 01:37:32.857
[Mary] <i> Zack is just one</i>
<i>of those magical beings</i>

01:37:32.924 --> 01:37:34.926
<i>who can walk up to a stranger,</i>

01:37:34.992 --> 01:37:37.462
<i>look her in the eye...</i>

01:37:38.429 --> 01:37:43.367
...and just immediately knows
her deepest, most intimate needs.

01:37:44.569 --> 01:37:46.471
Zack was like a brother to me

01:37:46.537 --> 01:37:52.009
and now that we share Rebirth,
he's like a big brother. [chuckles]

01:37:52.143 --> 01:37:55.046
- He's the big brother to us all.
- Yeah.

01:37:58.983 --> 01:38:01.886
[cheering]

01:38:02.386 --> 01:38:06.190
You know, when I started Rebirth
in my garage,

01:38:06.257 --> 01:38:08.559
<i>you know, building it out
one weekend at a time</i>

01:38:08.626 --> 01:38:11.996
<i>to the global force for good
that it is today...</i>

01:38:13.064 --> 01:38:15.333
<i>...that was the easy part.
You know?</i>

01:38:17.034 --> 01:38:19.270
Why I get out of bed every morning

01:38:19.337 --> 01:38:21.506
is knowing that there's other Kyles
out there.

01:38:21.572 --> 01:38:23.374
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:38:23.441 --> 01:38:28.012
<i>You see him at the grocery store.
See him at the gas station.</i>

01:38:28.312 --> 01:38:30.014
<i>The drugstore.</i>

01:38:30.081 --> 01:38:31.115
[grunting]

01:38:31.182 --> 01:38:32.283
Right?

01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:34.185
See him on the highway. [whistles]

01:38:34.252 --> 01:38:36.921
Going to work. Going home.

01:38:36.988 --> 01:38:39.290
Going to work. Going home, you know?

01:38:39.357 --> 01:38:41.959
Doing the Z.B. Zombie Boogie.

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:46.631
<i>But if you look him them the eye, man,
you'll see that they're dying,</i>

01:38:46.697 --> 01:38:48.499
<i>dying for something better.</i>

01:38:50.501 --> 01:38:52.537
They know it's out there.

01:38:52.603 --> 01:38:55.373
They just don't know what it is, you know?

01:38:55.439 --> 01:38:59.243
So, let's bring him up here.
Kyle Madison, everybody. Come on, man.

01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:03.614
[Zack] <i>Sometimes, uh,</i>
<i>I feel like a hunter. </i> [chuckles]

01:39:04.482 --> 01:39:07.051
[laughing]

01:39:07.118 --> 01:39:10.321
I got my gun, I got my bush hat on,

01:39:10.388 --> 01:39:12.290
and I'm stalking
through the suburban savannah,

01:39:12.356 --> 01:39:14.091
searching for my prey...

01:39:15.726 --> 01:39:18.663
<i>...and it's my job never to sleep, okay?</i>

01:39:18.729 --> 01:39:23.134
<i>It's my job never to take a break,
never to stop, man,</i>

01:39:23.201 --> 01:39:26.704
<i>until I share this
with each and every Kyle.</i>

01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:29.106
<i>It's an obligation.</i>

01:39:29.173 --> 01:39:30.173
<i>It's a duty.</i>

01:39:31.342 --> 01:39:33.678
Whew. [chuckles]

01:39:33.744 --> 01:39:35.713
Oh, man.

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.682
That's what gets me going. Hmm.

01:39:37.748 --> 01:39:39.317
Mm-hm.

01:39:39.383 --> 01:39:40.451
Yeah.

01:39:41.285 --> 01:39:43.254
That's what Rebirth means to me.

01:39:45.389 --> 01:39:48.092
[crowd cheering and whistling]

01:39:54.031 --> 01:39:57.468
[all chanting] <i>Rebirth! Rebirth! Rebirth!</i>

01:39:58.305 --> 01:40:04.642
