WEBVTT

05:15.449 --> 05:17.718
Well?

05:17.785 --> 05:20.087
Lem's got the whole bunch
safely out of Frisco now.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.489
We're fine.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.391
- What about the kempeitai?
- Quiet.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.258
Not for long.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.760
Where's Frank?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.499
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.475
You okay?

05:42.643 --> 05:45.012
What did you leave me
with her for?

05:45.078 --> 05:47.581
She's okay, Frank.
You can trust her.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.086
How long have you
been fighting?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.422
The Resistance since '57.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.857
The fighting, I've been
doing that forever.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.892
Taking a life
to save innocent lives

05:58.959 --> 06:00.961
is nothing to feel bad
about, Frank.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.897
- Yeah, I know that.
- Do you?

06:05.098 --> 06:08.769
I didn't think I could
actually kill a man.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.772
I can't say that feels good,
even if he was a pawn.

06:15.776 --> 06:20.648
Someone once told me
it takes a lot of effort
not to be free.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.683
I kept my head down
for so long,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.519
I forgot what it
feels like to stand up.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.990
So yeah.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.594
I feel better than I have
in a long, long time.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.164
Good.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.638
There you are, girls.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.341
Just like the women
used to wear in Hawaii.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.811
Behind your left ear
means you're married,

06:50.878 --> 06:54.482
and behind your right ear
means you're single.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.217
- No one's ever
going to marry Amy.
- Mom.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.852
You look so pretty.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.954
Okay, now go play,
both of you.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.023
An no more teasing,
Jennifer Smith,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.525
or there's no dessert.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.796
Max.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.901
Thomas, take Max out back
to play, will you, please?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.135
Max, come here, boy.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.172
Alice, what's wrong?

07:19.239 --> 07:20.541
Helen...

07:20.608 --> 07:22.510
Gerry's gone.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.512
Gone?

07:24.512 --> 07:27.380
They found him
in his car.

07:27.515 --> 07:31.018
His heart just gave out.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.807
Heil Hitler.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.142
Josef.

07:55.208 --> 07:59.146
I was told I need your
authorization to leave Berlin.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.949
That intelligence officer

08:02.015 --> 08:03.751
said something
to upset you last night?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.153
It doesn't matter. Look,
I just want to go home.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.760
The Fatherland is home, Josef,

08:12.826 --> 08:15.629
and Berlin the beating
heart of an empire

08:15.696 --> 08:17.598
that will live
for a thousand years.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.033
I've waited my entire life

08:20.100 --> 08:22.135
just wondering
what you would say to me

08:22.202 --> 08:24.337
when we first met.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.907
I never thought
you'd make a speech.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.342
You know, it's clear to me

08:29.409 --> 08:31.579
you don't understand, Josef.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.913
Do you understand

08:32.980 --> 08:35.482
why we spilled so much
blood in the war? Hmm?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.450
Why we...

08:37.585 --> 08:39.753
worked so hard
to build our industry

08:39.820 --> 08:42.623
and-- and our agriculture?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.659
Taking care of our families

08:45.726 --> 08:48.596
and teaching our children?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.063
It's because the Führer
has always believed

08:50.130 --> 08:52.633
we can do better,
that we can be better.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.235
There is no God in heaven.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.404
That means it's up to us

08:57.470 --> 09:00.140
to turn this life
into heaven on Earth.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.676
If you wanted me to be
a part of all this...

09:04.612 --> 09:06.747
maybe you shouldn't
have sent us away.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.183
Sent you away?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.153
I didn't leave your mother.
She left me.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.454
That's a lie.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.923
I wish it were.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.391
Then why didn't you
come try to find us?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.294
I tried, but she burnt
all my letters,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.030
and she wouldn't
take my calls.

09:23.096 --> 09:27.000
Elsa was so angry
that she was determined
to turn you against me,

09:27.067 --> 09:27.801
and she did.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.236
It was all her fault,

09:29.302 --> 09:32.272
and you did nothing wrong!

09:32.339 --> 09:33.741
Of course I did!

09:33.807 --> 09:36.276
But there were things
here in Berlin

09:36.343 --> 09:38.646
she couldn't accept.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.181
I never meant to lose you.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.315
I swear it.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.553
I can't
take back the past,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.756
but the future...

09:48.822 --> 09:51.558
that is up to us.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.326
Please stay.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.431
I'm sorry, sir.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.200
It's too late for that.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.873
Road blocks have been set up

10:05.939 --> 10:08.075
at all the major arteries
out of the city.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.277
And the civilians
in the transport vehicle,

10:10.343 --> 10:11.779
where were they collected?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.715
The Mission District.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
Send six foot soldiers
down there now.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.986
Kakka.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.288
Do not question me.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.657
These criminals are
begging us to escalate,

10:23.724 --> 10:26.193
an we shall oblige them.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.028
Hai, kakka.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.398
Trade minister, enter.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.306
You wanted to see me?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.475
You had these photographs
sent to me--

10:42.542 --> 10:44.044
the effect of the atomic bomb

10:44.111 --> 10:46.113
the Nazis dropped
in Washington.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.882
It seems relevant,
Onoda-kakka,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.984
given the project
we have embarked upon.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.722
You take pity on
the Americans, Tagomi-tasho,

10:54.722 --> 10:57.090
but where is your pity for us?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.393
The Führer surely would have
destroyed us if he could have.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.531
Respectfully, General,

11:04.597 --> 11:07.735
the Japanese
do not need pity.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.905
I am but a trade minister.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.641
It's not my job to disagree.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.044
It certainly is not.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.980
Take these with you
so you won't forget.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.750
Trade Minister.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.236
Listen to this.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.472
"Reinhart Heydrich
has retired

11:45.538 --> 11:47.140
to his estate outside Prague."

11:47.207 --> 11:49.409
And I am listening
because?

11:49.476 --> 11:51.845
Because Heydrich's one
of the most powerful
men in the Reich,

11:51.912 --> 11:53.313
and he's only 58.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.383
You got to read
between the lines.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.617
He was purged.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.052
Probably rotting away
in a cell somewhere

11:59.119 --> 12:00.420
for trying to overthrow
the old man.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.789
Don't you think?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.791
No because at the moment

12:03.857 --> 12:05.893
I don't care a whit
about any of it.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.195
Oh, you should. Once
Hitler's out of the way,

12:08.261 --> 12:10.297
the Nazis are going to level
this place with an A bomb,

12:10.363 --> 12:12.232
just like D.C.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.568
What?

12:15.635 --> 12:16.669
I'm curious.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.905
How would you assess

12:17.971 --> 12:20.507
the value of your life,
Mr. McCarthy?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.542
The value of my life?

12:22.609 --> 12:23.911
Mm-hmm.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.612
Mr. Frink laid waste
to his life--

12:25.678 --> 12:27.447
and, more importantly,
to mine--

12:27.514 --> 12:30.450
for an individual of
questionable intelligence

12:30.517 --> 12:31.819
and vulgar taste

12:31.819 --> 12:33.286
whose primary occupations
appear to be

12:33.353 --> 12:35.655
reading the newspapers
and picking his teeth.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.391
would you say
that was worth it?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.362
That question's
rhetorical.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.998
Where have you been?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.834
Ed, come on.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.601
We now
have only six days

12:48.668 --> 12:51.204
to deliver the 60,000 yen
the Yakuza demanded,

12:51.271 --> 12:54.975
and thus far you and your
verbose little friend here

12:55.042 --> 12:56.309
have done exactly nothing.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.612
We'll be back
with the materials.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.981
Have some food ready.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.516
I'm not your cook.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.087
Sir, to update you,

13:07.154 --> 13:08.655
our spies
in the Pacific States

13:08.721 --> 13:10.723
have accessed
a top-secret report.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.525
The Resistance car
was recovered

13:12.592 --> 13:13.861
from the Karen Vecchione
shooing.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.128
The kempeitai
believe it came

13:15.195 --> 13:17.530
from the High Castle
hideout.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.700
And soil samples from
tire treads were analyzed.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.335
The analysis
found a concentration

13:22.402 --> 13:25.238
of a particular phosphate
fertilizer

13:25.305 --> 13:27.941
and chemical and mineral
compounds that indicates

13:28.008 --> 13:29.409
they may be hiding...

13:40.453 --> 13:42.923
We'll update you as further
reports are intercepted.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.261
Sturmbannführer,
would you stay, please?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.067
Erich, there's something

13:54.134 --> 13:56.003
I'd like you
to look into for me.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.608
Two?

14:09.749 --> 14:10.984
Hi, Mark.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.586
Hey, Frank. How are you?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.022
This is
my friend Ed.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.723
- Hey, Ed. Good to meet you.
- Hi.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.125
Can we talk?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
Yeah, sure.
Come on, sit down.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.962
No, uh, alone.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.530
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.598
Listen, I'll be
right back, okay?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.235
So, Frank, I was--

14:28.301 --> 14:30.770
I was really pleased
to get your message.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.373
I kept thinking
about what you said.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.707
Beauty's important.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.609
An artist
should make art.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.978
Well, you're welcome

14:38.045 --> 14:40.313
to all the copper
and metal alloy that you want,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.416
but I'm going to need some
money to score some gold.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.088
We're broke, Mark,

14:48.155 --> 14:49.389
and we can't
finish the piece

14:49.456 --> 14:50.958
without the gold.
Can you advance it?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.625
We can pay you back
in a week.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.463
Uh, you're that sure you're
going to sell your art?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.633
We already
got a buyer lined up.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.402
Don't we, Ed?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.972
Yeah.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.810
Well...

15:10.877 --> 15:11.844
all right.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.013
I'll do it.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.448
For Laura, all right?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.219
Ed, good to meet you.
I'm going to go get it.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.859
Frank,
that guy's got kids.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.061
So?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.997
So don't get him
mixed up in this.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.364
We can't pay him back.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.166
All the money's got
to go to the Yakuza.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.867
You got a better idea?

15:35.002 --> 15:37.004
Exactly.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.221
Come on.
Don't look, don't look.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.758
It's reprisals.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.727
For what?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.262
It's like Boston
after the war.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.630
We take out one of their guys,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.832
and the Nazis would
kill ten of us.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.369
- Go!
- Dear God.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.838
I got to get my kids out of
here. Go, go, go, go, go.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.706
Frank?

16:13.773 --> 16:16.243
They want us to see this.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.345
What are we going to do?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.551
- Where is he?
- What's the matter?

16:24.617 --> 16:25.685
Hey, Gary.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.953
What?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.188
Uh, they're--

16:28.255 --> 16:30.057
they're shooting people
by the market.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.358
Yeah, we've heard.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.660
You've got guns.
Let's do something.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.495
We already did.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.730
You want them
to kill more people?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.766
We want the Pons
to feel unsafe.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.800
Now they do.

16:40.867 --> 16:41.934
Well, in that case,

16:42.069 --> 16:43.503
you can both
go fuck yourselves.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.373
We're just a handful
of people, Frank.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.076
How do you think you
bring down an empire?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.244
With fear. Once
the Pons are scared,

16:51.311 --> 16:54.481
they stop responding
an start reacting.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.916
And they strike back blindly.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.485
And fear spreads.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.321
Fear doesn't change
anything.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.590
Fear changes everything,
Frank.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.125
It changes everything.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.826
And once they're afraid,

17:06.893 --> 17:08.095
they'll turn
against each other.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.562
They'll tear
each other apart.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.964
That's how we
bring down the Pons.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.400
That's how
freedom-loving people

17:13.466 --> 17:16.002
have always brought
down empires.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.271
But if you can improve

17:18.338 --> 17:23.110
on thousands of years
of insurgent strategy...

17:24.244 --> 17:26.579
you know,
don't hold back, Frank.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.181
Speak up.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.619
Yeah.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.192
Done some checking
in on you.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.461
You're a pretty
handy fella.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.132
You worked
at a replica factory?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.301
Yeah, I did.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.872
Well, if you want
to do something...

17:52.939 --> 17:55.708
I mean...

17:55.775 --> 17:57.710
really do something...

17:59.045 --> 18:00.747
we could use your help.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.250
What kind of help?

18:05.685 --> 18:06.719
Danke.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.825
Joe Blake.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.694
What are you doing here?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.465
Buy me a drink.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.335
Come on.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.709
I would have ordered
champagne,

18:29.776 --> 18:32.812
but after what you said
to your father last night--

18:35.014 --> 18:36.283
Sorry you had
to witness that.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.186
You spoke your mind.
Don't apologize.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.057
Since you're going to leave
and never see me again,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.327
why don't you tell me
what happened?

18:47.394 --> 18:50.263
I don't feel comfortable
talking about that.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.699
That's why I'm plying you
with alcohol.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.404
I was congratulated for
getting some people killed.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.106
And did you?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.774
Get them killed?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.876
Not on purpose.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.782
So what are you going to do
back in New York?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.719
I got a job
working construction.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.854
Construction?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.990
Yeah. I know. It's
not an important job,

19:18.057 --> 19:20.393
but it's an honest job.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.028
It doesn't matter to you

19:22.094 --> 19:24.331
that you could do
important things here.

19:24.397 --> 19:28.601
Why not take advantage
of your father's position?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.370
Of his power?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.539
Or did you come all this way

19:32.605 --> 19:34.641
just to tell him
how hurt you were?

19:36.609 --> 19:41.047
Hmm. The only reason
that I came to Berlin

19:41.113 --> 19:42.649
is because he
ordered me to.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.887
I know you don't
want to hear this,

19:47.954 --> 19:51.558
but your father is trying
to do right by the Reich

19:51.624 --> 19:54.794
and now by you if you would
give him a chance.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.864
He doesn't deserve
another chance.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.334
Maybe not.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.986
But maybe you do.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.003
Julia. Oh,
how lovely you look.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.104
Thank you.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.540
Please.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.512
Something wrong?

21:19.579 --> 21:23.350
A dear friend
just lost her husband.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.551
I'm so sorry.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.919
Thomas,
this is Julia Mills.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.822
Uh, great.
Very nice to meet you.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.123
Pleasure.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.825
I'm still with Mrs. Adler.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.362
Do you think you can help
Julia study for the ACT?

21:35.362 --> 21:36.763
Oh, no, no.
I'll come back tomorrow.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.131
Nonsense. Thomas,
you don't mind.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.568
N-Not at all.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.636
Thank you so much,
Thomas.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.572
I'm sure helping
a newcomer study

21:45.638 --> 21:47.374
is the last thing
you feel like doing.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.641
It's okay.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.643
I actually like
to study.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.613
So what was it like?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.648
In the Pacific States, I mean.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.885
Do the Japanese really think
they're better than us?

21:58.951 --> 22:01.287
Well, I don't know.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.590
Doesn't everyone who wins
feel that way?

22:03.656 --> 22:04.957
I guess.

22:05.024 --> 22:09.496
But if they brainwashed you
with all that propaganda,

22:09.562 --> 22:11.464
this might be a little
hard for you.

22:11.531 --> 22:15.468
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you're here, then.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.739
Uh,

22:19.806 --> 22:23.209
the ACT is made
of three parts:

22:23.275 --> 22:25.412
reading, writing,
and civics.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.480
Okay.
I got two out of three.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.915
Straight to civics, then.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.316
First question:

22:30.417 --> 22:32.084
From where
does justice derive?

22:33.553 --> 22:35.422
Hmm. The Reich.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.458
Yes, but more
specifically.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.462
- The Führer?
- Very good.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.798
Justice is a divine right
guaranteed for all

22:45.865 --> 22:47.500
and determined
by the Führer,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.936
from whom all justice
derives.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.579
Thomas? You all right?

23:01.180 --> 23:03.616
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.888
Next question

23:08.955 --> 23:11.958
is about American
exterminations
before the Reich.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.726
Exterminations?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.497
Didn't they ever teach you
about the Indians?

23:18.831 --> 23:21.200
The reprisals were
carried out, Onoda-kakka.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.102
Ten Americans
for every soldier.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.071
Good. You're dismissed.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.205
Kakka,

23:26.272 --> 23:28.140
may I have the honor
of hosting you

23:28.207 --> 23:29.375
at the Club Omarei?

23:29.476 --> 23:31.043
I accept with pleasure.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.579
I know you would enjoy it.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.914
Until later, then.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.700
I just don't get it.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.103
What's a Japanese woman
doing fighting the Japanese?

23:57.169 --> 23:58.938
Oh, I'm not Japanese.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.774
I was born in America
to Japanese parents.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.409
There's a big difference.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.745
You never heard of Manzinar?

24:08.314 --> 24:09.916
Should I have?

24:12.519 --> 24:13.853
Forget it.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.123
You see those soldiers
over there?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.593
Last week,
a couple of workmen

24:20.660 --> 24:23.362
stumbled across a 2,000-pound
bomb in the basement

24:23.429 --> 24:25.765
that must have been dropped
during the bombardment of '45.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.736
What, do you want my help

24:29.802 --> 24:31.804
getting a 2,000-pound bomb
past them?

24:31.871 --> 24:36.308
Not the bomb, just some of
the explosive material inside.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.210
Getting past them
is going to be easy.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.779
You got to be kidding me.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.648
The Pons plan to dispose
of it tomorrow.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.650
If we don't do this today,
we lose it forever.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.685
Can you do it or not?

24:50.389 --> 24:51.691
Look, I'm no expert.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.660
I'd need to see exact
specifications.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.927
Well, I've been doing
some research.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.163
It's a Japanese
land bomb type 80.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.631
I'll get the specs to you.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.732
And I'll need
a second,

24:59.799 --> 25:01.200
someone with
engineering skill,

25:01.267 --> 25:02.735
someone I can trust.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.004
I don't know
anyone like that.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.040
I do.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.648
How did it go?

25:15.715 --> 25:17.584
Swell. She'll ace it.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.485
Oh, thanks to Thomas.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.953
He's been really wonderful.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.121
Good.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.724
I'm sorry I couldn't
spend time with you.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.093
Today's been just a--

25:27.159 --> 25:28.695
No, please, I understand.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.329
You all must be in shock.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.131
I saw him just last week,

25:32.198 --> 25:34.601
and it's hard to believe--

25:37.870 --> 25:40.740
Yes, it--
it was very sudden.

25:40.807 --> 25:43.643
I only hope
he didn't suffer.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.080
Thank you, Jasper.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.151
Miss Mills.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.656
You've been studying
with my wife?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.424
With Thomas, actually.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.627
Huh.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.094
I'm going to check
with Helen.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.730
Do you think you'd like
to join us for dinner

26:03.796 --> 26:05.698
- tomorrow night?
- That's so kind of you.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.299
You've done so much for me
already. I couldn't.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.802
Oh, nonsense. It's the least
we can do, really.

26:09.869 --> 26:13.105
Unless, of course, you've
already made other friends.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.109
No. I'll be here.

26:17.176 --> 26:20.512
Good. I'll have Helen call
you with the details.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.848
Thank you.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.793
Yes, I'm looking for an
address, please, in Brooklyn

26:33.860 --> 26:36.663
D-I-X-O-N.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.034
We only have six days
to pay the Yakuza, Frank.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.003
- This is important.
- More important
than staying alive?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.571
That massacre on the street.

26:45.672 --> 26:46.839
This is how we get back, Ed--

26:46.906 --> 26:48.340
not at the soldiers
following orders

26:48.407 --> 26:49.575
but at the officers.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.043
How did we even
get mixed up in this?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.679
Are you telling me
you don't want to get even

26:52.745 --> 26:55.347
after what they did to Laura,
after what they did to you?

26:55.414 --> 26:56.716
We're in enough
trouble already.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.050
We got to stay
out of this.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.686
I can't do that,
not anymore, not ever again.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.320
I know what it feels like
to fight now,

27:01.387 --> 27:03.022
and I want you
to feel it, too.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.324
According to the specs
you gave me,

27:05.391 --> 27:07.559
it's 2 1/2 meters long,
half a meter across,

27:07.694 --> 27:09.996
with a steel casing
5 millimeters thick.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.398
Right. The core's
filled with picric acid

27:12.464 --> 27:13.599
in crystalline form.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.801
You said the fuse
was crushed.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.068
You'll have to go in

27:16.135 --> 27:17.536
through the plate
below the drop pin.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.071
You do realize we drill

27:19.138 --> 27:21.173
even a millimeter past
the inner edge of the casing,

27:21.240 --> 27:22.608
we'll all blow sky high.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.776
Along with
our best chance

27:23.843 --> 27:25.011
of striking back
at the Pons.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.413
So what do we do,
drill through the casing

27:27.479 --> 27:28.480
and vacuum out the crystal?

27:28.547 --> 27:29.949
It's too volatile.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.221
We add water.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.889
Turn them into liquid,

27:36.956 --> 27:39.325
siphon them into a canister
using a pump.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.497
You guys have
all the tools you need?

27:45.564 --> 27:47.566
Uh, tools aren't the problem.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.102
No. The problem is we don't
know what we're doing.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.438
And if we mess this up,
we're all going to die.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.307
This is crazy, Frank.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.044
But think of the damage
we can do to the Pons.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.946
And I'll be down there
with you.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.783
And I say it's
a risk worth taking.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.837
If anybody sees you,
you know what to do.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.389
Frank.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.891
Thanks.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.810
What am I forgetting?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.344
To breathe.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.281
Yeah.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.218
All right, here we go.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.345
What happened?

29:39.411 --> 29:40.379
It's okay, it's okay.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.115
All right,
give me the cobalt bit.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.918
You should have used
cobalt to start with.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.988
Yeah, well, we'll know that
for the next bomb, won't we?

29:51.757 --> 29:52.959
Here.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.854
Almost there.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.525
Stop.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.944
Give me the flashlight.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.186
Looks like we didn't cut
all the way through.

30:54.253 --> 30:58.124
You keep drilling,
you'll trigger the bomb.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.093
I'm going to have to finish
with the hand tool.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.562
Oh, fuck.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.145
Can I help you?

31:53.212 --> 31:56.015
Uh, yes.
I'm here to see George.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.184
Does George Dixon live here?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.387
I'm sorry. Mr. Dixon moved
several months ago.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.222
I see.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.392
But he does
stop by occasionally
to pick up his mail.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.430
Okay. Um, well,
I'm an old family friend.

32:11.497 --> 32:17.536
Uh, let me just leave you
my name and my number.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.007
If you wouldn't mind giving
this to him when you see him,

32:21.007 --> 32:22.541
I'd greatly appreciate it.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.511
Thank you very much.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.227
Excuse me, Miss.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.199
Juliana!

32:48.500 --> 32:50.902
We are now boarding
train number 91,

32:51.037 --> 32:53.539
now boarding at Gate 1415.

32:55.607 --> 32:56.642
Thank you.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.711
A schedule, please.

32:59.778 --> 33:00.712
Mm-hmm.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.515
Thank you.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.272
Where have you been hiding?
It's been so long.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.109
I'm sorry, Miss.
You've mistaken me for--

34:03.175 --> 34:05.444
Oh, Henry, don't
be standoffish.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.612
My name is Bill.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.013
Bill, I'm teasing.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.348
Can't take a joke?

34:09.415 --> 34:10.982
- Of course I can.
- Good.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.551
Is that what this is?
A joke?

34:12.618 --> 34:15.154
Just-- Just go with it,
okay? Don't spoil it.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.022
Okay. It's just that--

34:17.123 --> 34:19.158
Fate brought us
together today.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.027
You believe in fate,
don't you?

34:22.128 --> 34:23.929
- I believe in fate.
- I do.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.497
I really do.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.499
It's just
that I am married

34:27.566 --> 34:30.136
and my wife will be
out any-- Mm!

34:32.738 --> 34:34.806
What do you think
you're doing?

34:34.873 --> 34:36.342
Huh? Hon--

34:36.408 --> 34:39.178
That's my husband,
you floozy!

34:43.014 --> 34:44.350
Come on, come on!

34:50.622 --> 34:51.823
Go that side.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.576
Ohh.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.379
Sara.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.046
Yeah.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.982
That place you mentioned.

35:17.048 --> 35:20.186
The, uh, Man--
Man-something.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.587
Manzinar.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.189
Yeah.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.624
Why didn't you tell me
about it?

35:28.460 --> 35:30.829
It's just a patch
of dirt, really.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.532
About ten hours
from here.

35:33.599 --> 35:37.803
We were relocated there
by the U.S. Army.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.339
My family and thousands
of other Japanese people.

35:40.406 --> 35:44.543
American citizens suddenly
considered enemy aliens.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.614
My dad said,

35:48.680 --> 35:52.884
"Sara, one fine day,
they'll win,

35:52.951 --> 35:54.620
and they'll
open that gate."

35:56.355 --> 35:58.524
He meant
the Japanese Empire.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.228
And one fine day,
they did win.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.130
One fine day for you.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.732
Yeah.

36:06.798 --> 36:07.899
They won.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.003
But they looked at us,
an all they could see

36:12.070 --> 36:13.772
was that we left Japan.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.241
We weren't Americans,

36:15.274 --> 36:17.709
but we weren't
Japanese, either.

36:17.776 --> 36:18.844
We were...

36:21.780 --> 36:23.249
hangyakunin.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.453
Yeah, traitors.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.988
So you hate the Americans.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.257
You hate the Pons.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.692
Who are you fighting for?

36:33.759 --> 36:35.461
I don't hate anyone.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.936
Bingo. We got it.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.609
- Victory.
- Mm.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.284
You don't like to drink,
do you, Kido-tai'i?

37:03.622 --> 37:06.292
I am happy to drink
with you, Kakka.

37:07.693 --> 37:08.794
I must warn you.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.298
I can always tell
when someone is lying.

37:12.364 --> 37:17.002
And you lie out of
respect, Kido-tai'i.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.371
I like you.

37:20.939 --> 37:21.973
Leave us.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.916
These are dark days
for the Empire.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.618
Darkness?

37:34.152 --> 37:35.987
We may be
the superior race,

37:36.054 --> 37:39.558
but we have fallen
behind our enemies,

37:39.625 --> 37:42.227
now that the Crown Prince
is shot,

37:42.328 --> 37:44.830
our men gunned down
on the streets.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.932
Of course you are right,
Onoda-kakka,

37:46.998 --> 37:51.069
but wherever there is power
there is subversion,

37:51.136 --> 37:54.005
whether in Manchuria or here.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.012
Kakka, may I raise
with you again

38:01.079 --> 38:02.514
the subject of the films?

38:02.581 --> 38:05.517
You missed the point,
Kido-tai'i.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.719
We are seen as weak.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.957
If a nation
is seen as weak,

38:12.023 --> 38:13.459
it is weak.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.859
Keep pumping.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.096
Fill her up.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.945
Ed, you can go home.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.514
Sara and Frank, you can
lay low here with the stuff.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.451
I'll send you a message
where to stash it, okay?

39:45.484 --> 39:47.152
Hey.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.987
I think they can
take it from here.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.321
We should get back.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.924
I'm going to help them
finish.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.426
You go ahead.

39:54.426 --> 39:54.460
You go ahead.
Well...

39:54.460 --> 39:56.562
Well...

39:56.628 --> 39:58.029
what about our obligation?

39:58.096 --> 40:01.199
I bet Childan's
tearing his hair out.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.134
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.473
Come on, Ed.
I'll give you a lift.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.164
Mm.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.636
Oi. More whiskey.

40:37.703 --> 40:40.906
And you will drink it with us.

40:40.972 --> 40:41.940
Hmm.

40:45.711 --> 40:47.779
Of course, Onoda-kakka.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.849
I'm afraid
I don't drink whiskey.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.985
You two make a fine pair,

40:54.052 --> 40:59.257
And I order you to leave
that button undone.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.592
Hmm.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.796
What do you drink?
We will order that.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.166
I...

41:08.233 --> 41:10.101
like port.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.371
Nobody drinks that
around here.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.641
We'll have the Nazis
send some.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.109
They will do
as they are told.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.778
Isn't that so, Kido?

41:21.547 --> 41:24.716
But perhaps
it is best to go home.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.154
Yes. It is time.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.857
Mm!

41:31.923 --> 41:34.125
Kakka.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.361
Ah, before we leave,

41:36.427 --> 41:37.796
might I have your seal

41:37.863 --> 41:40.966
on that routine order
we discussed?

41:41.032 --> 41:42.568
Seal.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.137
Hai.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.916
Routine order.

42:13.632 --> 42:14.866
Kakka.

42:14.933 --> 42:15.901
Hai.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.605
Mm.

42:34.886 --> 42:39.658
So they left you and your
family to rot in Manzinar.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.527
I would think that
would crush your spirit,

42:42.628 --> 42:44.730
- but you're this--
- I'm this what?

42:47.065 --> 42:49.635
I was going to say
firebrand,

42:49.635 --> 42:53.204
- but that sounded...
- bad.

42:55.674 --> 42:57.308
It sounds nice.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.084
So why are you?

43:11.990 --> 43:13.659
I was probably about 7 or 8

43:13.692 --> 43:15.761
when, um,
a few dozen inmates

43:15.827 --> 43:17.829
staged a hunger strike.

43:17.896 --> 43:21.733
I stood in he corner,
scared as hell,

43:21.800 --> 43:23.935
watching the guards come.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.339
Do you really
want to hear this?

43:28.406 --> 43:29.808
Yeah.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.881
They got beaten down.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.750
They were kicked and punched.
Their hands were bloodied.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.153
And then they stood up again...

43:42.220 --> 43:45.290
knowing that they'd only
get beaten down again.

43:47.358 --> 43:49.094
And watching them do that...

43:50.696 --> 43:53.264
was the first time in my life
that I felt...

43:54.432 --> 43:58.203
something like...defiance.

43:59.938 --> 44:03.709
It was a-- a thrill.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.829
Hey.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.036
Coming to bed?

45:06.304 --> 45:07.338
Helen?

45:09.007 --> 45:12.643
You know I spent the whole
afternoon with Alice.

45:12.778 --> 45:14.279
Yeah, you said.

45:16.514 --> 45:18.116
Uh...

45:18.183 --> 45:19.484
she must be--

45:20.852 --> 45:22.320
devastated.

45:24.790 --> 45:27.425
She is. She's devastated.

45:29.527 --> 45:31.229
John, I'm going to
ask you a question,

45:31.296 --> 45:33.598
and I need for you
to tell me the truth.

45:33.664 --> 45:34.833
Helen.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.003
Don't.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.538
John, what have you done?

45:40.605 --> 45:42.407
Don't ask me any more.

45:42.473 --> 45:45.811
But wh-why?

45:51.549 --> 45:53.284
Look at me.

45:53.351 --> 45:56.421
All you need to know
is everything I do--

45:56.487 --> 45:58.323
everything--

45:58.389 --> 45:59.891
I do it for the family,

45:59.958 --> 46:01.692
to keep our children safe.

46:01.827 --> 46:02.861
For the family?

46:02.928 --> 46:04.395
Our son is ill.

46:08.834 --> 46:10.535
I knew that there
was something.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.837
Gerry was going
to report him.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.872
But that is no reason
for you to--

46:13.939 --> 46:15.206
There's no cure.

46:20.578 --> 46:22.147
There's no cure.

46:28.219 --> 46:29.554
Mm.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.189
Mm, uh...

46:36.194 --> 46:38.096
What-- What--
What are you going--

46:38.163 --> 46:39.664
- What are we going to do?
- We're not going to kill him.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.066
We're not
going to kill our son.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.300
But they're going to make us.

46:42.367 --> 46:44.169
A man of your rank,
and if we don't,

46:44.235 --> 46:46.404
then they are going to take
my babies away from me.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.306
- No, they won't.
- What are you talking about?

46:48.373 --> 46:50.876
Of course they will. They
are going to kill your son.

46:50.876 --> 46:52.878
Do you trust me, Helen?

46:55.080 --> 46:56.281
Do you trust me, Helen?

46:56.347 --> 46:57.315
Yes.

46:58.383 --> 47:01.052
It's not going to happen,
all right?

47:01.119 --> 47:02.954
They're not going to do it...

47:04.089 --> 47:06.224
because I'm no going
to let them do it.

48:22.667 --> 48:24.002
Hello.

48:26.037 --> 48:27.638
Look out your window.

48:29.674 --> 48:30.976
Who is this?

48:31.042 --> 48:33.178
Pick up your phone,
take it to the window,

48:33.244 --> 48:34.679
and look outside.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.192
I hear you've been
looking for me.

48:48.726 --> 48:50.095
I'm George Dixon.

48:52.463 --> 48:53.431
George?
