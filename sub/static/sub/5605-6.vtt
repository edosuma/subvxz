WEBVTT

00:05.011 --> 00:06.643
Halloween is so fun.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.606
I just love seeing
all the little superheroes

00:08.608 --> 00:11.308
before they can pronounce
their (lisping) S's.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.842
(lisping) I'm Thuperman,

00:12.844 --> 00:14.710
and -- and my thithter's name
ith Thpider-man.

00:14.712 --> 00:15.811
(laughs)

00:15.813 --> 00:17.345
Good morning,
lovely ladies.

00:17.347 --> 00:18.713
Yo.
Hey.

00:18.715 --> 00:21.482
Don't you mean,
(spookily) ghoul morning?

00:21.484 --> 00:25.452
Why didn't I walk straight
to the car?

00:25.454 --> 00:28.054
Honey, listen. I'm gonna need
you to come home a little early.

00:28.056 --> 00:30.489
I can't decorate all by myself,
and the girls have plans.

00:30.491 --> 00:34.492
I had plans
25 years ago.

00:34.494 --> 00:35.960
Guess who
messed that up.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.229
Oh, I'm going to the range
to shoot at stuff,

00:39.231 --> 00:40.530
and they're gonna
dress up the targets

00:40.532 --> 00:41.998
to look like werewolves.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Before they transform
or after they transform?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.535
'Cause before they transform,
you're actually shooting people.

00:47.671 --> 00:49.637
And now that
I'm finally legal,

00:49.639 --> 00:51.639
I can go to costume parties
at bars

00:51.641 --> 00:53.040
and not have
my costume be

00:53.042 --> 00:56.142
the person whose picture
is on my fake I.D.

00:57.011 --> 00:59.845
Don't worry, Mom,
I'll be responsible.

00:59.847 --> 01:01.179
Oh, please.

01:01.181 --> 01:02.547
By midnight,
you'll be puking

01:02.549 --> 01:04.749
through the eyeholes
of your Hello Kitty mask.

01:04.751 --> 01:05.983
Ah, joke's on you.

01:05.985 --> 01:07.250
I'm going
as "sexy Pope,"

01:07.252 --> 01:09.018
so I'll be puking
into my hat.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.888
Wow. Everybody in hell
will think that's hysterical.

01:12.890 --> 01:15.423
Sometimes I hate Halloween.
Why don't we just skip it?

01:15.425 --> 01:18.192
No, we are doing Halloween,
Mike, and do you know why?

01:18.194 --> 01:19.393
Girls, you're gonna see
a rare event here --

01:19.395 --> 01:21.094
I'm gonna lose
an argument

01:21.096 --> 01:22.195
'cause your mom is holding
the Halloween trump card --

01:22.197 --> 01:23.829
Boyd.

01:23.831 --> 01:26.865
That's right, and we love
our grandson...  Mm-hmm.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.867
...so as long as
Boyd is coming to this house,

01:28.869 --> 01:30.535
we are gonna scare
the hell out of him.

01:30.537 --> 01:32.370
You got me, there.

01:32.372 --> 01:34.538
As long as
he's coming to this house.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.174
Why did you repeat
what I just said?

01:38.176 --> 01:39.508
I talked to Ryan.

01:39.510 --> 01:41.209
He's not letting
Boyd come to this house.

01:41.211 --> 01:43.344
What? Why not?
I don't know.

01:43.346 --> 01:45.279
But something about the
slaughter of innocent pumpkins.

01:45.281 --> 01:46.280
I don't know.

01:46.282 --> 01:47.881
I don't listen to him,

01:47.883 --> 01:49.549
but that way
we don't have to do Halloween.

01:49.551 --> 01:51.017
No, no, no.
No, no.

01:51.019 --> 01:52.785
Even if Boyd isn't coming,
it is still Halloween...

01:52.787 --> 01:54.586
Honey, honey, honey. ...and
we can give out candy

01:54.588 --> 01:56.788
to kids
in their cute little costumes

01:56.790 --> 01:59.223
and -- and see the excitement
on their little faces.

01:59.225 --> 02:01.024
Mom, it's over.
Yeah.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.826
Have some dignity.

02:04.728 --> 02:06.360
Honey, we got no skin
in this game.

02:06.362 --> 02:08.562
Tonight's a perfect night
to watch a different game --

02:08.564 --> 02:11.364
the Michigan Wolverines play
the Minnesota Golden Gophers.

02:11.366 --> 02:12.898
But I already bought
all the candy.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.232
Well, just give it
to Dad.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.867
He steals the good stuff
and hides it anyway.

02:16.869 --> 02:21.537
You can't steal stuff
that you pay for.

02:21.539 --> 02:23.205
What happened to you?

02:23.207 --> 02:24.906
You -- You used to love
dressing up

02:24.908 --> 02:26.741
and -- and scaring
the trick-or-treaters

02:26.743 --> 02:28.642
and now this.
What?

02:28.644 --> 02:30.076
I'm sorry,
I'm just not ready

02:30.078 --> 02:32.211
for my husband to turn into
some grumpy old man.

02:32.213 --> 02:33.445
I don't think it makes me
a grumpy old man

02:33.447 --> 02:34.746
because I don't like
a bunch of damn kids

02:34.748 --> 02:36.880
trampling over
through my yard.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.817
-- captions by VITAC --

02:45.589 --> 02:47.055
(doorbell rings)

02:47.057 --> 02:48.189
I got it.

02:50.159 --> 02:52.092
Hey, Chuck.
Hey, trick-or-treat.

02:52.094 --> 02:55.595
Honey, it's our first
trick-or-treater.

02:55.597 --> 02:57.930
It's --
It's all the Pips.

02:57.932 --> 02:59.264
Hi, Chuck.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.598
Hey, how you doing?
Good.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.333
I'm gonna leave this candy
with you.

03:02.335 --> 03:03.934
It's laced
with marijuana.

03:03.936 --> 03:05.936
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

03:05.938 --> 03:08.471
Funny black guy
giving me drugs.

03:08.473 --> 03:10.873
Get a funky sweater --
Bill Cosby?

03:13.911 --> 03:16.811
It's from
your dad's pot shop.

03:16.813 --> 03:18.512
I gave him a ride
to the airport.

03:18.514 --> 03:20.947
On the way, he remembered he
can't take that on the plane.

03:20.949 --> 03:23.015
I'll put it in my gun safe.
Mm-hmm.

03:23.017 --> 03:24.583
Look at that --
drugs and guns.

03:24.585 --> 03:26.952
I'm definitely
a libertarian.

03:26.954 --> 03:29.621
See you're getting ready
for the big night.

03:29.623 --> 03:31.522
Carol's pretty excited,
too.

03:31.524 --> 03:34.291
I know, I know.
We're both gonna be witches.

03:34.293 --> 03:36.426
Oh, so no costumes
this year?

03:37.695 --> 03:41.129
Carol wants me
to be Denzel.

03:41.131 --> 03:43.431
I guess a decorated Marine
can't compete

03:43.433 --> 03:46.133
with a fake
alcoholic pilot.

03:46.135 --> 03:48.101
Oh, come on, Chuck.
Don't you want to dress up?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.969
I'm a grown man!
Yeah.

03:49.971 --> 03:51.804
I just want
to put on my gopher head

03:51.806 --> 03:54.439
and watch Minnesota
beat the hell out of Michigan.

03:54.441 --> 03:56.207
You<i> are</i> a Minnesota fan.
That's right.

03:56.209 --> 03:58.542
We should watch the game together.
No, no, no, no.

03:58.544 --> 04:00.477
I'd love to see a gopher cry.
Come on, really.

04:00.479 --> 04:02.145
Well, you're not watching it here.
Why not?

04:02.147 --> 04:03.646
This house
is doing Halloween.

04:03.648 --> 04:04.813
Great.
My place, then.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.114
I got cable
just like you,

04:06.116 --> 04:08.216
except I don't watch
redneck fishing,

04:08.218 --> 04:11.219
redneck hoarding,
or redneck storage spaces.

04:11.221 --> 04:13.354
Why do you have cable?

04:19.227 --> 04:20.659
Thank you.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.160
ED: Hey.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.661
Happy Halloween, Ed.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.663
Yeah, it's a great holiday,
but, you know,

04:25.665 --> 04:27.865
it's really best
when the kids are little.

04:27.867 --> 04:31.168
The smiles on their faces --
Well, it's -- it's just magical.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.069
It's magical. Mr. Alzate,
is it all right

04:33.071 --> 04:34.503
if I knock off
a little early today?

04:34.505 --> 04:37.038
I have kids.
Again with the kids?

04:38.141 --> 04:39.573
And you also have
a job.

04:39.575 --> 04:41.174
Please,
finish unloading the truck.

04:41.176 --> 04:42.909
Thank you very much.

04:42.911 --> 04:44.343
Yeah, there's nothing
like seeing the excitement

04:44.345 --> 04:46.011
on a kid's face
on Halloween.

04:46.013 --> 04:47.712
Cherish these days
with Boyd, now.

04:50.183 --> 04:52.516
Kris, please tell me
these guys in costume

04:52.518 --> 04:54.317
aren't waiters
at the restaurant.

04:54.319 --> 04:56.385
I don't want people
serving wild game around here

04:56.387 --> 04:57.853
with a hatchet
in their head.

04:57.855 --> 05:00.422
I told everyone
"no costumes."

05:00.424 --> 05:02.657
I already sent the Flash
home to change,

05:02.659 --> 05:05.993
which was over an hour ago,
so I guess he broke character.

05:05.995 --> 05:10.363
I do not like to see
our employees in costume.

05:10.365 --> 05:12.598
(as Ed)
Couldn't agree more, Mikey.

05:19.573 --> 05:22.340
You know, but if, uh,
one of our employees, like say,

05:22.342 --> 05:24.442
I don't know, Kyle,
were to come in costume,

05:24.444 --> 05:26.510
we could let it slide,
right?

05:26.512 --> 05:29.546
Well, I suppose
we're going to have to.

05:29.548 --> 05:31.915
By the way, Mikey,
love the vlog.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.717
Another home run.

05:34.719 --> 05:37.052
We haven't posted it yet,
Kyle.

05:37.054 --> 05:40.722
Oh, I guess I only thought
you had 'cause I'm old.

05:40.724 --> 05:42.223
Isn't that what
you're always saying about me?

05:42.225 --> 05:45.292
(chuckles)
Because you are old.

05:45.294 --> 05:47.127
Yep, I'm old.

05:47.129 --> 05:51.231
So I just smile
like the proud Basque I am --

05:51.233 --> 05:53.900
never showing my true feelings,
never letting anyone in,

05:53.902 --> 05:56.035
which is kind of sad
when you think about it,

05:56.037 --> 05:57.369
so I don't.

05:57.371 --> 05:59.404
And the cycle continues.

05:59.406 --> 06:01.205
Uh, when Ed sees this,

06:01.207 --> 06:04.041
we may have an employee
with a hatchet in his head.

06:04.043 --> 06:06.209
(normal voice)
What are you talking about?

06:06.211 --> 06:08.477
I don't think Ed's gonna think
this is all that funny.

06:08.479 --> 06:09.811
Oh, I don't know.

06:09.813 --> 06:11.145
I-I think he'll see past
the silly beard

06:11.147 --> 06:12.613
and the silly no hair

06:12.615 --> 06:13.981
and see it for what it is...
Okay.

06:13.983 --> 06:15.816
...a loving tribute
to a great man.

06:15.818 --> 06:18.385
I don't know. If it were me,
I'd punch you in the face.

06:19.721 --> 06:22.588
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
hello, hello.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.789
What do we have here?

06:23.791 --> 06:25.290
D-D-D-Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.592
A zombie, huh?

06:27.594 --> 06:29.393
You're one of those things
that was dead,

06:29.395 --> 06:32.396
but then it comes back to life
and still looks like it's dead.

06:32.398 --> 06:34.564
Nope.
I'm not a zombie.

06:34.566 --> 06:36.065
I'm actually -- Don't tell him.
Don't tell him. Don't tell him.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.132
Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
I'm you.

06:37.134 --> 06:38.766
Ugh.
You told him.

06:38.768 --> 06:40.234
Me?

06:41.270 --> 06:42.836
That's supposed to be me?

06:44.239 --> 06:46.339
That's...

06:46.341 --> 06:48.941
I love it.
I love it. I love it!

06:48.943 --> 06:50.909
I l-- (laughs)
Look at that.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.977
(spookily)
This is your reward

06:53.979 --> 06:57.613
for making it through
the gauntlet of horror.

06:57.615 --> 06:59.615
We were going to
make it a lot scarier,

06:59.617 --> 07:01.950
but we didn't want to frighten
the really little kids...

07:01.952 --> 07:04.619
and we opened the wine.
(laughs)

07:04.621 --> 07:06.053
Sorry -- magic potion.

07:07.456 --> 07:10.790
Ah, did you see the excitement
on all their little faces?

07:10.792 --> 07:13.092
Yeah. I mean, what could
possibly be better than this?

07:13.094 --> 07:15.627
College football game,
according to our husbands.

07:15.629 --> 07:18.796
You know, two grown men
sitting alone in a dark room --

07:18.798 --> 07:20.964
Yeah.
It just seems so sad.

07:20.966 --> 07:22.832
-Touchdown!
-Penalty!

07:22.834 --> 07:24.266
Bringing it back!

07:24.268 --> 07:25.800
(laughs)

07:25.802 --> 07:27.535
So sad.

07:27.537 --> 07:29.803
Well, I can't say I didn't
see this coming.  Yeah.

07:29.805 --> 07:31.771
I mean, Chuck never
wants to do anything new.

07:31.773 --> 07:35.307
I tried to sign us up for
cooking class, swing dance.

07:35.309 --> 07:37.776
Huh, I'm surprised
Chuck would need dance lessons.

07:37.778 --> 07:39.043
Really? Why?

07:39.045 --> 07:42.012
Well,
he just must have great rhythm.

07:43.215 --> 07:45.148
You know,
b-because he was --

07:45.150 --> 07:47.316
he was a Marine
and -- and --

07:47.318 --> 07:49.618
I mean, they --
they march, so...

07:49.620 --> 07:50.819
You can stop.

07:50.821 --> 07:53.221
-Oh, thank you.
-(laughs)

07:53.223 --> 07:54.855
Oh, gosh.

07:54.857 --> 07:58.158
You know, Mike has become
pretty set in his ways, too.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.325
For example,
in the bedroom --

07:59.327 --> 08:01.060
Oh, my God.
Stop.

08:01.062 --> 08:02.494
No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

08:02.496 --> 08:04.496
I meant, uh, the decorating.
Oh.

08:04.498 --> 08:06.998
He freaked out
when he saw it was different.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.632
-Mm.
-Yeah, but just so you know,

08:08.634 --> 08:11.568
the other bedroom stuff --
got no complaints.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.169
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

08:13.171 --> 08:15.237
If we gonna talk about
<i> that</i> bedroom stuff,

08:15.239 --> 08:16.871
I'm going to need
some more magic potion.

08:16.873 --> 08:18.239
Oh.

08:18.241 --> 08:21.408
I don't know, Carol.
What are we gonna do?

08:21.410 --> 08:24.310
This can't be the way things are
for the rest of our lives.

08:24.312 --> 08:27.346
Yeah, this is how it should be
for the rest of our lives --

08:27.348 --> 08:29.681
cold beer, good football game,
a neighbor...

08:29.683 --> 08:31.749
who I'm neutral about.
Yeah.

08:31.751 --> 08:34.418
Yeah, I think it's great we've reached
an age where we can simplify.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.853
My wife doesn't get that.
For instance, in the bedroom --

08:36.855 --> 08:37.854
Time-out, brother.

08:37.856 --> 08:39.555
No, no, no.

08:39.557 --> 08:41.490
I mean, when I got back
from the road this time,

08:41.492 --> 08:42.657
she changed everything
in the bedroom.

08:42.659 --> 08:43.924
Oh.
Like, everything.

08:43.926 --> 08:46.359
Carol signed us up
for cooking classes.

08:46.361 --> 08:48.661
(scoffs)
I'd have gone, too,

08:48.663 --> 08:51.664
except then
I'd know how to cook...

08:51.666 --> 08:54.199
and there goes
a perfectly good excuse.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.266
(doorbell rings)

08:55.268 --> 08:57.034
Did you order
more pizza?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.536
No, but you know what?
I was thinking about it.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.438
Maybe these smartphones
are getting too smart.

09:03.541 --> 09:06.108
We've got a line of
trick-or-treaters out there.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.211
Someone covered my porch
with jack-o'-lanterns.

09:09.213 --> 09:11.580
It was the wives.

09:11.582 --> 09:13.281
You just start enjoying
something, they ruin it.

09:13.283 --> 09:14.715
Just like in the bedroom.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.216
(doorbell ringing)
Don't open that door.

09:16.218 --> 09:18.084
You -- You'll unleash
a hell storm

09:18.086 --> 09:19.552
of little Disney characters
and Batmans.

09:19.554 --> 09:20.753
You will not
be able to control it.

09:20.755 --> 09:21.887
Don't open the -- Oh!

09:21.889 --> 09:24.890
TOGETHER:
Trick or treat.

09:24.892 --> 09:26.224
The ladies
across the street

09:26.226 --> 09:28.059
said you were giving out
the good stuff.

09:28.061 --> 09:30.561
Oh.
They did, did they?

09:30.563 --> 09:33.397
You know what?

09:33.399 --> 09:35.298
They're right.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.734
"World's Greatest Mom."
Here you go.

09:38.736 --> 09:40.402
And, uh, oh!

09:40.404 --> 09:43.905
Yeah, enjoy that<i> Women Today</i>
magazine, tiny nerd.

09:43.907 --> 09:46.574
I see what we're doing.

09:46.576 --> 09:47.708
Is this the wife's?

09:47.710 --> 09:49.042
Oh, not anymore.

09:49.044 --> 09:50.743
Well, look at that.

09:50.745 --> 09:54.146
Now you got a master's degree
from Howard University.

10:01.554 --> 10:06.322
O-M-G, I did such a good job
on your makeup!

10:06.324 --> 10:08.424
I could get a job
working in Hollywood,

10:08.426 --> 10:11.627
you know, if they ever
make a movie about Ed.

10:11.629 --> 10:13.228
(as Ed) Makeup?

10:13.230 --> 10:14.896
I don't know what you're
talking about, little lady.

10:14.898 --> 10:17.798
Ugh!
No, no, no.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.066
I don't want you to kiss me
when you look like that.

10:20.068 --> 10:23.602
I would feel like I was
cheating on you with future you.

10:23.604 --> 10:26.671
And I don't want future you
to be into young chicks.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.439
(normal voice) Yeah,
but y-you know it's just me.

10:28.441 --> 10:30.607
Yeah, my ears do,
but my eyes don't

10:30.609 --> 10:32.642
and I hate it
when they get confused.

10:32.644 --> 10:34.844
It's like when I see that movie
with all the talking toys

10:34.846 --> 10:37.246
and I keep thinking
I hear my dad's voice.

10:41.084 --> 10:43.584
(as Ed) (grunts)
Hey, there, Frankie.

10:43.586 --> 10:45.752
You know, seeing you
bust your hump here every day

10:45.754 --> 10:48.454
reminds me
of my old man.

10:48.456 --> 10:50.289
I could cry.

10:50.291 --> 10:53.792
But I won't, because
real men don't feel things.

10:53.794 --> 10:56.494
Who am I kidding?
Bring it in here, buddy.

10:57.697 --> 10:59.096
Hey, Ed.

10:59.098 --> 11:00.797
Still enjoying
Kyle's impersonation of you?

11:00.799 --> 11:02.198
No.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.766
He's hugging
all the employees.

11:03.768 --> 11:05.934
He's opening up both of us
to a lawsuit.

11:05.936 --> 11:07.302
Let me help you
with that.

11:07.304 --> 11:08.970
I may be old,
but I'm strong.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.871
It's all the jazz dancing.

11:12.975 --> 11:14.307
What the hell
is he talking about?

11:14.309 --> 11:17.343
Teenage girls jazz dance.
I salsa.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.812
Close your eyes
or your wish won't come true.

11:19.814 --> 11:21.346
That's it.
Okay. Okay.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.314
So, I'm a damn genie now,
huh?

11:23.316 --> 11:26.317
Nice costume, Kyle.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.886
This is a workplace.
Party's over.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.024
That was a brilliant idea,
Carol --

11:35.026 --> 11:37.326
sending those trick-or-treaters
over to the guys.

11:37.328 --> 11:39.394
(laughs) Thank you. Yeah.

11:39.396 --> 11:43.131
In my sorority days,
I was the big prankster.

11:43.133 --> 11:44.899
Yeah, yeah,
one time at a party,

11:44.901 --> 11:46.333
I got everyone's attention
and I said,

11:46.335 --> 11:48.801
"Hey! Hey!
We're all out of sloppy joes!"

11:50.738 --> 11:52.804
And I said, "Just kidding.
There's plenty back there."

11:52.806 --> 11:55.373
(laughs)
Yeah, you told me that.

11:55.375 --> 11:58.709
That's why I figured
I should take the lead on this.

11:58.711 --> 12:00.377
Hmm, you know,
it's been pretty quiet.

12:00.379 --> 12:02.045
I wonder where
all those trick-or-treaters are.

12:02.047 --> 12:03.479
Well,
maybe it's too important to you.

12:03.481 --> 12:05.714
You know,
kids can smell desperation.

12:05.716 --> 12:07.882
There's plenty of kids
out there,

12:07.884 --> 12:09.416
but they're just
walking by.

12:17.191 --> 12:18.490
Lady.

12:18.492 --> 12:21.359
Uh, this has Chuck
written all over it.

12:21.361 --> 12:22.560
Oh,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:22.562 --> 12:24.194
This is actually
a great thing.

12:24.196 --> 12:25.828
Our husbands fired back.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.729
Hey,
maybe they're not dead inside.

12:27.731 --> 12:29.997
Yeah. Well,
we've got to keep this going.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.565
The ball is in our court.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.733
No, no, no, no, no.
You mean, in<i> my</i> court.

12:33.735 --> 12:35.334
Because this is a job

12:35.336 --> 12:38.337
for the Delta Delta Delta
prankster prankster prankster.

12:42.442 --> 12:45.075
(chuckles) Looks like
the wives brought Lady in.

12:45.077 --> 12:47.610
Ah, it's not over. Vanessa will
call at any minute and say,

12:47.612 --> 12:50.346
"Uh,
we're out of sloppy joes."

12:50.348 --> 12:51.680
Hey...

12:51.682 --> 12:53.214
Chuck,
you might want to watch this.

12:53.216 --> 12:55.883
(sighs) Man, you're on
the 6-yard line, about to score.

12:55.885 --> 12:57.551
Why would I want
to see that?

12:57.553 --> 12:59.386
So you can see what it
looks like when I'm happy.

12:59.388 --> 13:00.954
Here we go.

13:00.956 --> 13:02.588
Quick shovel pass
and they're gonna be in there.

13:02.590 --> 13:03.855
In there!
(static crackles)

13:03.857 --> 13:06.357
WOMAN:
<i> Ronald, I'm pregnant.</i>

13:06.359 --> 13:07.558
Why did you
change the channel?

13:07.560 --> 13:08.959
I didn't
change the channel.

13:08.961 --> 13:10.460
Well, look at this.
Well, I wasn't --

13:10.462 --> 13:12.295
-(laughs)
-Oh, that was perfect!

13:12.297 --> 13:15.297
You changed the channel right
when the pass was in the air!

13:16.967 --> 13:18.533
Chuck
was so condescending

13:18.535 --> 13:21.068
when he set up
this phone control of the DVR.

13:21.070 --> 13:25.204
"It's technology.
How about you leave it to me?"

13:25.206 --> 13:27.706
How about
I stick it to you?

13:27.708 --> 13:30.141
Yeah!
(both laugh)

13:30.143 --> 13:31.876
I don't know what happened,
but I fixed it.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.110
Get off my back.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.611
All right,
all right, all right.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.079
Got another shot at it --
another shot.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.580
A little rollout.
Maybe just a little rollout.

13:37.582 --> 13:38.981
Watch this. Goes -- Go --
(static crackles)

13:38.983 --> 13:40.816
MAN:<i> Are you sure</i>
<i> the baby's mine, Andrea?</i>

13:40.818 --> 13:43.585
<i> I will not help you raise</i>
<i> another man's baby.</i>

13:43.587 --> 13:44.986
For the love of God,
what's happening?

13:44.988 --> 13:46.420
I don't --

13:46.422 --> 13:47.721
(both laugh)

13:47.723 --> 13:49.422
Lifetime --

13:49.424 --> 13:53.325
television for women who want to
mess with their husbands!

14:00.966 --> 14:02.799
Please tell me
you didn't tell her

14:02.801 --> 14:04.433
how to program this
from her phone.

14:04.435 --> 14:06.902
No way. It's technology.
I told her to leave it to me.

14:06.904 --> 14:09.237
We should have never
engaged them...

14:09.239 --> 14:11.739
or got engaged to them --
see how that turned out.

14:11.741 --> 14:14.308
Well (clears throat)
it's halftime.

14:14.310 --> 14:17.244
We got 20 minutes to figure out
how to get back at them.

14:17.246 --> 14:19.079
What would you rather do,

14:19.081 --> 14:21.681
get back at them
or enjoy the rest of the game?

14:24.986 --> 14:26.185
(knock on door)

14:26.187 --> 14:27.819
Hey, Mr. Alzate.

14:27.821 --> 14:30.421
I'm finished for the day.
I was thinking I might take off.

14:30.423 --> 14:32.790
Fine.

14:32.792 --> 14:36.093
You know, I-I'm sorry if
my impression upset you today.

14:36.095 --> 14:38.595
I-I'm still working on
the voice.

14:38.597 --> 14:40.763
That's not
what pissed me off.

14:40.765 --> 14:42.598
(as Ed) That's not
what pissed me off.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.968
Please, stop working on
the voice, all right?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.936
The whole thing
was insulting.

14:48.938 --> 14:50.270
(normal voice)
I didn't mean it to be.

14:50.272 --> 14:51.304
It was meant
to be a tribute.

14:51.306 --> 14:52.672
A tribute?

14:52.674 --> 14:55.007
Oh, that's why
everybody was laughing, huh?

14:55.009 --> 14:57.109
"Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful
if Ed was nice?

14:57.111 --> 14:58.944
Ah, hardy hardy hardy.
Yeah, yeah."

14:58.946 --> 15:00.946
But you are nice.

15:00.948 --> 15:03.014
No, Kyle, I'm not.

15:04.283 --> 15:06.483
I wanted to be.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.284
(groans)

15:08.286 --> 15:12.054
Yeah, I'd always promised myself
I'd be exactly like Mr. Finch.

15:12.056 --> 15:14.156
He was my first boss.

15:14.158 --> 15:16.491
I loved him.
Everybody loved him.

15:16.493 --> 15:20.794
I mean, you had any problems
at work or with your girl,

15:20.796 --> 15:22.529
you go to Mr. Finch.

15:22.531 --> 15:24.564
Yep.

15:24.566 --> 15:26.799
Yeah,
he was a caring man.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.467
You're like that.

15:28.469 --> 15:33.037
Well, maybe I used to be,
but, you know...

15:33.039 --> 15:36.640
It's a tough business.
You have to make hard decisions.

15:36.642 --> 15:39.009
You know, you fire enough guys
with -- with families,

15:39.011 --> 15:42.145
you have to convince yourself
that it doesn't hurt.

15:42.147 --> 15:45.481
Then one day,
it doesn't.

15:45.483 --> 15:46.882
There's a positive.

15:48.352 --> 15:50.318
Kyle, go home.
Go ahead.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.821
All right, but if I only get to
be you for a few more minutes...

15:53.823 --> 15:56.156
Yeah. ...I've got
something I want to say.

15:56.158 --> 15:59.259
I may tell people that being
tough doesn't hurt anymore,

15:59.261 --> 16:01.494
but it does.

16:01.496 --> 16:03.395
Or else
I wouldn't have gotten so mad

16:03.397 --> 16:06.730
at that loveable goofball
who was dressed like me all day.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.832
Okay, Kyle.

16:09.834 --> 16:14.302
And now the Ed I am
would hug you and we'd cry.

16:16.339 --> 16:19.139
And the Ed I am
would punch you and you'd cry.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.174
How about this?

16:25.012 --> 16:26.878
You're a good man, Ed.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.347
You're a good man, too,
Ed.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.316
Oh, come on with that.

16:34.019 --> 16:36.418
Is it weird
this feel so right?

16:38.422 --> 16:40.255
Way to kill your moment,
kid.

16:45.528 --> 16:47.628
(sighs)
Hey, ladies.

16:47.630 --> 16:50.030
Hey, what are you guys
doing back so early?

16:50.032 --> 16:51.698
Don't you want to see
how the game ends

16:51.700 --> 16:54.933
or if Ronald gets back together
with Andrea?

16:56.469 --> 16:58.368
Look, we just want to
watch the game.

16:58.370 --> 17:00.103
You know, you win. You win.
We just want peace.

17:00.105 --> 17:01.637
Oh, everybody wants peace,
honey,

17:01.639 --> 17:04.373
you know,
when you're losing.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.375
Let us
finish watching the game.

17:06.377 --> 17:08.043
And next Halloween,
we'll be all over it.

17:08.045 --> 17:09.577
I'll be Denzel

17:09.579 --> 17:12.112
and -- and I won't even ask you
to be Halle Berry.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.213
But I won't stop you.

17:13.215 --> 17:15.582
(laughs)

17:15.584 --> 17:17.550
What do you think, Carol?
Should we let them off the hook?

17:17.552 --> 17:18.817
I don't know.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.318
Well, w-what if
I sweeten the deal

17:20.320 --> 17:22.553
by saying...Chuck will go
dancing with you?

17:22.555 --> 17:24.321
Done.
Hey!

17:24.323 --> 17:26.623
How'd you figure out
the phone/DVR thing, anyway?

17:26.625 --> 17:28.558
YouTube.
You better watch out.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.661
Saw a video on how to
sew a grown man into a bedsheet.

17:31.663 --> 17:35.131
(chuckles)
Okay, let's go, Mike.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.833
But be prepared -- My Gophers are a
second-half team. (doorbell rings)

17:37.835 --> 17:40.068
Explains why they did so badly
first half.

17:40.070 --> 17:42.003
-Hey.
-Trick or treat!

17:42.005 --> 17:44.238
You guys need to
talk to the witches.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.241
Ooh,
you look so scary!

17:47.243 --> 17:50.277
Ooh. Eve, honey,
we're running low on candy!

17:50.279 --> 17:52.946
Seriously? I just dumped a bag
in there like five minutes ago.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.614
You used the candy
from that bag?

17:54.616 --> 17:56.582
Yeah,
I found it in your gun safe.

17:56.584 --> 17:58.350
Holy crap.

17:58.352 --> 17:59.851
Why were you
in my gun safe?

17:59.853 --> 18:01.419
Well, I went to the range,
remember?

18:01.421 --> 18:02.753
I was
putting my pistol back.

18:02.755 --> 18:04.454
Sorry I gave away
your candy stash.

18:04.456 --> 18:05.455
Holy crap!

18:05.457 --> 18:06.856
What's the big deal?

18:06.858 --> 18:08.757
That's the candy I got
from Mike's dad.

18:08.759 --> 18:11.825
It was
laced with marijuana.

18:12.961 --> 18:15.394
So it really was
a stash.

18:16.764 --> 18:19.431
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.799
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.767
We gave marijuana
to children.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.602
We're dealers!

18:24.604 --> 18:25.970
I-I was never here.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.771
Not too many drug pushers
get into West Point.

18:29.207 --> 18:30.773
Where are you going?

18:30.775 --> 18:33.275
We've got to
get that stuff back!

18:33.277 --> 18:35.644
So you're literally gonna
take candy from babies.

18:35.646 --> 18:37.479
Sweetie, let me get a look
inside that bag.

18:37.481 --> 18:38.480
-No.
-Just a little peek.

18:38.482 --> 18:39.948
Just a little peek!

18:39.950 --> 18:41.516
For God's sake,
give me the bag!

18:41.518 --> 18:45.186
Witches are taking my candy!
Witches are taking my candy!

18:45.188 --> 18:47.388
What are you doing
with my master's diploma?

18:47.390 --> 18:49.556
(siren wails)

18:49.558 --> 18:51.124
Uh-oh.

18:51.126 --> 18:52.391
(police radio chatter)

18:52.393 --> 18:53.959
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

18:53.961 --> 18:55.860
Carol, uh,
you do the talking.

18:55.862 --> 18:57.127
Cops make me nervous.

18:57.129 --> 18:58.895
They make<i> you</i> nervous?

18:58.897 --> 19:00.997
Hey, fellas,
what can we do for you?

19:00.999 --> 19:02.531
We've had
some very disturbing reports

19:02.533 --> 19:04.633
about tainted candy
being handed out in this area.

19:04.635 --> 19:05.800
Is this your house?

19:05.802 --> 19:07.168
Uh, yeah, yeah,
yes, it is,

19:07.170 --> 19:10.871
uh, uh, Officer...Schlumbrecht,
is it?

19:10.873 --> 19:13.974
Gosh,
that is such a pretty name.

19:13.976 --> 19:16.509
Vanessa,
give it a rest.

19:16.511 --> 19:18.043
Just a misunderstanding. Nothing
really was going on here.

19:18.045 --> 19:19.310
-Step back, sir.
-I'm not doing anything.

19:19.312 --> 19:20.711
I'm just explaining
what's going on.

19:20.713 --> 19:22.212
You want to talk about this
down at the station?

19:22.214 --> 19:23.713
-No. No, I don't want to --
-Hey, hey, hey.

19:23.715 --> 19:24.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Aren't you guys overreacting?

19:24.816 --> 19:25.815
You want to go with him,
sir?

19:25.817 --> 19:27.483
-Maybe I do!
-Chuck!

19:27.485 --> 19:29.485
No, you got to have a warrant.
We have rights here.

19:29.487 --> 19:31.086
It was us, Officer.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.154
We -- We -- We gave out
the pot candy.

19:33.156 --> 19:34.755
She's right.
It was us.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.423
Mainly her.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.691
So your husbands had absolutely
nothing to do with this?

19:38.693 --> 19:40.993
No, no, no. They were just
trying to enjoy the game.

19:40.995 --> 19:43.161
Yes, we were just
trying to enjoy the game.

19:43.163 --> 19:45.596
Wait. Why did you
just repeat what I said?

19:45.598 --> 19:46.830
Because
you didn't do anything wrong,

19:46.832 --> 19:49.098
except
mess with the wrong guys!

19:49.100 --> 19:51.066
-(laughter)
-What?

19:51.068 --> 19:52.000
What?!

19:52.002 --> 19:53.334
That's right!

19:53.336 --> 19:55.169
W-We set up
the whole thing.

19:55.171 --> 19:58.005
These two officers moonlight
for my security company.

19:58.007 --> 20:00.040
-Thanks, guys.
-No problem.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.008
Call me.

20:02.010 --> 20:04.944
I texted Eve. I told her to take
the candy out of the gun safe.

20:04.946 --> 20:06.512
Well,
where is the pot candy now?

20:06.514 --> 20:08.614
The candy
never left the safe.

20:08.616 --> 20:10.248
Yeah.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.083
You should have seen
the look on your face, Mom.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.584
Okay.

20:13.586 --> 20:15.218
(sighs) You were right.
Halloween is great.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.019
Priceless.

20:17.021 --> 20:19.087
(laughing) "The witches
are taking my candy!

20:19.089 --> 20:21.355
The witches
are taking my candy!"

20:21.357 --> 20:23.690
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You two got us.

20:23.692 --> 20:25.692
But at least we got you guys
off of the couch.

20:25.694 --> 20:28.594
And remember what you said --
Next Halloween we go all-out.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.929
Oh, you silly witch.
Those were terms for peace!

20:30.931 --> 20:32.363
We won the war.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.431
Back to the game.
That's right.

20:41.472 --> 20:42.971
(whistles)
That's it.

20:42.973 --> 20:45.540
Come on. Everybody out.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.742
Go home. Enjoy Halloween
with your families.

20:47.744 --> 20:49.110
Come on. Go.
Come on.

20:49.112 --> 20:51.479
(as Ed)
You heard me.

20:52.615 --> 20:54.781
Wow.
You're getting better.

20:54.783 --> 20:56.749
And if any of you
are having problems at work

20:56.751 --> 20:59.184
or with your girl,
you come see me.

21:00.754 --> 21:03.755
Dennis,
what are you still doing here?

21:03.757 --> 21:04.789
You've got kids.

21:04.791 --> 21:06.123
Yeah,
well, I also have a job.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.124
Not anymore.

21:07.126 --> 21:09.459
What?

21:09.461 --> 21:11.627
I meant tonight.
Go home.

21:11.629 --> 21:13.595
You're done.
Enjoy the kids.

21:13.597 --> 21:15.296
Go ahead.
I'll finish unloading the truck.

21:15.298 --> 21:18.165
I'm still strong enough...
from jazz dancing.

21:21.270 --> 21:23.503
(normal voice) You see that?
You are nice.

21:23.505 --> 21:26.905
Mm. When I said,
"I'll finish it," I meant you.

21:26.907 --> 21:28.606
Come on.
