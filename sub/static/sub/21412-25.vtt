WEBVTT

00:06.315 --> 00:07.612
Whoo!

00:07.745 --> 00:09.721
Good to be back 
in my right mind again.

00:09.816 --> 00:12.658
Hard to believe Doc Ock got me 
to join the Sinister Six.

00:12.726 --> 00:15.502
Especially when Aunt May can't
even get me to join her book club.

00:15.628 --> 00:18.096
Well, guess that's why
they call it mind control.

00:18.548 --> 00:22.182
I'm just lucky the Hobgoblin was there
to bail me out. Wouldn't you say?

00:22.336 --> 00:24.281
I haven't been able to say anything

00:24.349 --> 00:25.857
with you blabbering all the time.

00:25.925 --> 00:29.158
And don't be so formal, Pete.
I may be the Hobgoblin,

00:29.226 --> 00:31.088
but I'm still your ol' pal Harry.

00:31.283 --> 00:34.062
Uh, let's keep the identities
a secret, okay?

00:34.241 --> 00:37.062
Sorry. I'm still new to
this whole superhero thing.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.000
Ah, maybe.
But we already make

00:39.068 --> 00:40.820
the perfect
crime-fighting team.

00:41.009 --> 00:44.578
I mean, we took down Vulture,
Spider Slayer, and Steel Spider.

00:44.732 --> 00:46.648
All that's left
is Rhino and Ock.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.281
Doc Ock will be
the toughest to bring down.

00:49.414 --> 00:51.851
Plus fighting Rhino is like
fighting a freight train.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.707
Yeah, but they still need to
answer for the damage they caused.

00:54.875 --> 00:58.671
I'm getting a police report that the Rhino
is rampaging through uptown Manhattan.

00:58.784 --> 01:00.239
Let's hit him hard!

01:06.073 --> 01:07.675
Don't forget,
that's Aleksei.

01:07.743 --> 01:09.921
He may be a rampaging Rhino,
but he's still our friend.

01:09.989 --> 01:12.375
Can't give up on a friend
no matter how vicious they get.

01:12.478 --> 01:15.773
How about big? Can you give
up if they get too big?

01:18.255 --> 01:19.428
Not a chance.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.679
Should we try
the old web-glider takedown?

01:21.747 --> 01:23.289
One of my favorites.

01:23.962 --> 01:26.750
Hey, Aleksei,
I heard you like to dance.

01:26.898 --> 01:29.914
Check out this new move.
I call it the Rhino Shuffle.

01:29.982 --> 01:31.539
Ahh, nice!

01:31.607 --> 01:35.086
Although
it's not nearly as cool as this move.

01:35.535 --> 01:36.903
Whoa...

01:39.412 --> 01:40.961
Hobgoblin!

01:47.890 --> 01:51.726
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER-MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01   Episode 25</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Hobgoblin: Part Two"</font>

01:52.661 --> 01:55.000
Hobgoblin!
What happened?

02:01.358 --> 02:03.367
Hobgoblin, are you okay?

02:05.263 --> 02:07.224
Come on, Rhino. Why are you so angry?

02:07.292 --> 02:09.513
You fit right in here at the zoo.

02:13.596 --> 02:15.326
Olé! No good?

02:15.394 --> 02:17.799
Then let's see what's behind curtain
number two.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.457
Uh-oh!

02:28.434 --> 02:30.504
Hey, you okay?
What was that?

02:30.572 --> 02:32.403
My new high-tech
finger blaster.

02:32.471 --> 02:34.395
- It's sweet, huh?
- No.

02:34.463 --> 02:36.279
I mean, you blacked out.

02:36.511 --> 02:38.159
- Are you all right?
- Probably just not used

02:38.226 --> 02:39.785
to this superhero schedule.

02:39.853 --> 02:42.043
What's next?
Search for Doc Ock?

02:42.168 --> 02:44.747
No. Next, you need
to see a doctor.

02:44.815 --> 02:46.692
Relax, Aunt May.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.661
I'm sure I just need some rest.

02:48.766 --> 02:51.325
We just took down
four of the Sinister Five.

02:51.393 --> 02:53.043
Can't a guy get a break?

02:53.111 --> 02:56.379
Okay. Go home
and get some rest.

02:56.533 --> 02:59.270
Need to be in top form
if we're gonna defeat Doc Ock.

02:59.366 --> 03:02.772
But then promise me you'll
get checked out by a doctor.

03:02.938 --> 03:04.801
Will do.

03:06.703 --> 03:09.418
And hey, nice work for a Sunday.

03:09.713 --> 03:12.200
Thanks.
Although it's Monday.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.903
What?

03:17.268 --> 03:18.754
I can't believe it!

03:18.963 --> 03:22.512
I was late for the first day of school,
and now I'm gonna be late for the last.

03:22.707 --> 03:26.434
And the award for perfect
attendance goes to...

03:28.881 --> 03:30.801
In your dreams, Peter.

03:34.295 --> 03:35.942
Anya Corazon.

03:36.926 --> 03:41.278
Wow, Anya. You're gonna have to design
a special trophy case for all your awards.

03:41.390 --> 03:44.075
I did. That's what
this one is for.

03:47.913 --> 03:49.879
Where were you all morning, son?

03:49.981 --> 03:52.747
Uh, just hanging out with Pete.

03:52.939 --> 03:56.168
But I'm gonna go lie down.
Feeling a little spent.

04:03.054 --> 04:07.072
Wow! Congrats, guys.
I wish I had won something.

04:07.323 --> 04:10.575
You did. "Most Likely
to Miss an Awards Ceremony."

04:10.643 --> 04:11.991
I made it myself.

04:12.636 --> 04:14.742
Oh. Thanks.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.958
Luckily Peter's grades make up
for his lack of awards.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.965
Max, there's an intruder in Lab 319.

04:23.049 --> 04:25.543
319? That's Otto's old lab.

04:25.858 --> 04:28.864
I thought that ridiculous awards ceremony

04:28.932 --> 04:31.247
would've kept you occupied
for at least another hour.

04:31.315 --> 04:34.551
No bother.
I got what I came for.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.684
Leave me a message.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.426
Harry, I found Doc Ock
at Horizon High.

04:39.494 --> 04:40.967
Could use your help. Huh?

04:41.035 --> 04:42.715
You want villain takedown
or crowd control?

04:42.784 --> 04:46.089
Get everyone back in the auditorium.
I'll take down Ock.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.559
Crowd control it is.

04:50.535 --> 04:52.910
Security alert. Prepare
to be destroyed.

04:53.855 --> 04:55.408
Max, we've gotta
get the students

04:55.484 --> 04:57.527
into the auditorium
where it's safe.

04:57.979 --> 05:01.503
Never dreamed you'd come
crawling back to Horizon High.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.667
Wasn't taking over
Oz Academy enough?

05:04.019 --> 05:06.316
Or are you trying
to pad your résumé?

05:11.378 --> 05:13.230
He did that on purpose!

05:14.685 --> 05:17.519
You know there are easier ways
of getting ahead in life, right?

05:17.587 --> 05:20.464
Like if you'd stayed my teammate
and fought on the side of good.

05:21.132 --> 05:23.526
Make no mistake, Spider-Man.

05:23.594 --> 05:26.988
There are many reasons for my
shift toward villainy.

05:28.152 --> 05:31.722
But your dopey quips were reason
enough to end our partnership.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.785
That's okay.
'Cause guess what.

05:33.883 --> 05:35.714
I've got a new partner.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:45.785 --> 05:47.144
You fools!

05:48.043 --> 05:50.886
Your contraptions
can't hold me forever!

05:51.720 --> 05:53.425
Again with the new tech.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.347
Oh, man,
you're just full of surprises.

05:57.388 --> 05:58.705
Whoa!

05:59.814 --> 06:03.972
What? I didn't mean I wanted more of them.
What was that about?

06:04.040 --> 06:07.254
There's only room for one of
us in this city, Spider-Man,

06:07.325 --> 06:10.221
and it's going to be
the Hobgoblin.

06:11.566 --> 06:13.644
Harry, what are you doing?

06:13.745 --> 06:17.732
There is no one else!
Only Hobgoblin!

06:41.207 --> 06:42.605
Back off, Gobby!

06:43.027 --> 06:44.331
Hang on, Spider-Man.

06:44.399 --> 06:46.769
This looks like
an electromagnetic link.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.831
- Get out of here before you get hurt!
- No way.

06:49.899 --> 06:52.628
If we can cut the current,
we should be able to get you out.

06:52.776 --> 06:55.010
All of you are protecting
a criminal.

06:55.078 --> 06:57.160
Spider-Man is a menace.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.205
And when you've
come to your senses,

06:59.273 --> 07:02.136
you'll join the Hobgoblin
in bringing him down.

07:03.746 --> 07:06.233
Or be destroyed alongside him!

07:08.909 --> 07:10.691
- Girls, get clear!
- Almost there...

07:12.175 --> 07:13.863
"Almost" isn't gonna cut it.

07:13.931 --> 07:16.902
Unless I use the bomb's momentum
to reverse the trajectory.

07:17.743 --> 07:19.027
Go!

07:26.941 --> 07:29.519
What did you do
to upset the Hobgoblin?

07:29.702 --> 07:33.480
I have no idea...
but I'm gonna find out.

07:34.921 --> 07:38.120
<i>And what at first seemed
like a takedown of Dr. Octopus</i>

07:38.245 --> 07:42.113
<i>soon turned into a battle between
Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin.</i>

07:42.323 --> 07:44.800
<i>You people are protecting a criminal.</i>

07:44.868 --> 07:47.956
<i>Spider-Man is a menace. And when
you've come to your senses,</i>

07:48.024 --> 07:50.667
<i>you'll join the Hobgoblin
in bringing him down.</i>

07:50.869 --> 07:54.386
<i>Based on Spider-Man's recent
involvement with the Sinister Six,</i>

07:54.507 --> 07:57.988
<i>this reporter wonders if the
Hobgoblin might have a point.</i>

08:00.937 --> 08:04.660
- Oh. Peter.
- Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Osborn.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.490
I'm trying to reach Harry.

08:06.716 --> 08:09.844
He wasn't feeling well earlier,
so I thought I'd check in.

08:10.149 --> 08:12.964
- May I speak with him?
- Oh, that's nice of you, Peter,

08:13.066 --> 08:15.128
but he's been asleep
all afternoon.

08:15.324 --> 08:18.290
Must need the rest.
I'll tell him you called.

08:18.417 --> 08:20.355
He'll be happy to know
his friend is concerned.

08:20.436 --> 08:21.995
Thanks, Mr. Osborn.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.941
I think I'll pay Harry
a visit regardless.

08:26.724 --> 08:28.464
Harry? Are you up?

08:28.540 --> 08:30.516
Your friend Peter called, and...

08:30.748 --> 08:33.957
Harry! Son! What's wrong?

08:35.058 --> 08:36.866
Uh, where am I?

08:38.191 --> 08:40.269
Why am I in my Hobgoblin gear?

08:40.337 --> 08:43.863
Because you've been busy. Look.

08:44.410 --> 08:47.670
- You people are protecting a criminal.
- What?

08:47.738 --> 08:49.943
- I don't remember that.
- Spider-Man is a menace.

08:50.011 --> 08:51.846
- And when you've come to your senses...
- Why would I do such a thing?

08:51.913 --> 08:54.003
I think you're stepping
into the light, Harry.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.183
Your subconscious must be taking over,

08:56.396 --> 09:00.835
Turning you into the hero our
family... and this city... needs.

09:01.255 --> 09:03.035
I... I don't understand.

09:03.122 --> 09:04.683
- How could...
- Think about it.

09:04.807 --> 09:08.133
All those serums you tested
on yourself to find my cure,

09:08.242 --> 09:09.759
all those trials...

09:09.862 --> 09:12.056
Who knows
what effect it's had on you?

09:12.612 --> 09:15.121
- But...
- Just rest, son.

09:15.844 --> 09:17.623
You should be proud of yourself.

09:17.867 --> 09:21.800
You're finally achieving the greatness
I've always envisioned for you.

09:30.199 --> 09:31.410
Pete!

09:31.520 --> 09:34.316
- What's going on?
- I thought we were cool with each other.

09:34.384 --> 09:37.050
- We are.
- I-I... I don't know what happened.

09:37.564 --> 09:39.581
You attacked me is
what happened.

09:39.735 --> 09:44.980
I know! I-I mean, I saw it on the news,
but I don't remember any of it.

09:45.048 --> 09:47.136
I must've blacked out again.

09:47.990 --> 09:51.473
Look, if you're still angry
about Oz Academy, I get it.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.605
But can we talk about it
like normal people?

09:53.716 --> 09:56.011
I swear, I've forgiven you!

09:56.964 --> 09:58.870
At least I think I have.

09:58.938 --> 10:01.449
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

10:01.572 --> 10:03.241
Something my dad said.

10:04.118 --> 10:07.050
What if deep down,
I haven't forgiven you,

10:07.118 --> 10:09.435
and my subconscious is acting out?

10:09.891 --> 10:12.058
All the more reason to see a doctor.

10:12.126 --> 10:13.449
No!

10:15.571 --> 10:17.128
I'm afraid to.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.511
When I was trying to find
a cure for my dad, I...

10:20.900 --> 10:23.019
I experimented on myself.

10:23.152 --> 10:26.144
I'm not proud of it, but it's
what I had to do to save him.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.800
Now I'm not sure what's
coursing through my veins.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.572
And I'm terrified at what
I might've done to myself.

10:32.846 --> 10:34.872
Harry, listen to me.

10:35.004 --> 10:37.370
We are two of the brightest
minds in this city.

10:37.487 --> 10:40.073
The best way to solve this
thing is with a team-up.

10:40.581 --> 10:42.175
I agree, Pete.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.261
But it can't be with you.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.238
It's not safe.

10:46.343 --> 10:49.097
You've gotta get as far away
from me as possible.

10:49.370 --> 10:51.129
You're my best friend, Harry.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.605
- I just want to...
- I know, but you can't.

10:55.670 --> 10:57.742
Look, you told me once
that you couldn't share

10:57.810 --> 11:00.148
your secret with me because
it would put me in danger.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.070
Well, now it's my turn.

11:02.287 --> 11:06.594
For your own protection, you've got to
stay away until I can figure this out.

11:06.905 --> 11:09.891
Fine. But I hope
you'll change your mind.

11:11.282 --> 11:14.055
I can't help feeling Harry
is making a mistake.

11:14.123 --> 11:17.190
But why am I surprised?
This building is a monument

11:17.258 --> 11:19.633
to geniuses
who've made poor decisions...

11:19.733 --> 11:23.342
Otto Octavius,
Adrian Toomes, Doc Connors.

11:23.672 --> 11:26.602
If only Harry could learn
from them and accept my help.

11:26.832 --> 11:30.805
Maybe that's it. Maybe friends
don't take no for an answer.

11:33.824 --> 11:36.016
Uh-oh! Spider-sense!

11:43.185 --> 11:46.612
I told you I wouldn't rest
until you were destroyed, Spider-Man.

11:46.783 --> 11:48.809
You are a blemish on society.

11:48.877 --> 11:51.745
I intend to take you out!

11:52.308 --> 11:53.410
No!

11:55.191 --> 11:57.694
Good luck surviving this!

11:58.859 --> 12:01.553
Oh, no! The bridge!

12:07.206 --> 12:08.647
Get out of the bus!

12:08.733 --> 12:10.292
The doors won't open.

12:10.371 --> 12:12.006
We're trapped!

12:13.100 --> 12:15.069
Can't hold it!

12:16.388 --> 12:18.147
Can't help these people!

12:20.139 --> 12:22.616
Can't even help my best friend!

12:23.350 --> 12:26.413
Maybe I'm not the hero
I thought I was.

12:26.898 --> 12:29.538
I'm sorry, Uncle Ben!

12:31.289 --> 12:32.856
Peter, what's wrong?

12:32.935 --> 12:34.842
I fell, and we lost the race.

12:35.038 --> 12:37.428
- Did you get up?
- Yes.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.858
Did you run

12:38.926 --> 12:41.381
- even though you were hurt?
- Uh-huh.

12:41.503 --> 12:44.981
Well, Petey, if you ask me,
you're a hero in my book.

12:45.579 --> 12:48.696
Because winning isn't always
about coming in first, my boy.

12:48.764 --> 12:52.555
Sometimes it's pushing
when it seems like you can't.

12:52.665 --> 12:56.173
Or getting up when people think
you're down. And that's what you did.

12:56.257 --> 12:58.701
Heck, you probably inspired
someone else out there today.

12:58.891 --> 13:03.376
Because the only time you really
lose is when you stop trying.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.926
You remember that.

13:09.181 --> 13:11.056
You're right, Uncle Ben.

13:11.401 --> 13:15.509
Can't... stop... trying!

13:15.804 --> 13:18.251
Have to be the hero
you see in me.

13:19.327 --> 13:22.654
Have to be...
Spider-Man!

13:31.598 --> 13:33.427
Spider-Man, you okay?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.814
Police scanner said
that you were being attacked.

13:35.901 --> 13:38.276
It was the Hobgoblin
again, but he got away.

13:38.277 --> 13:41.366
No, he didn't. I hit him with a spider
tracer when I swung in.

13:41.544 --> 13:44.623
Figured helping out a friend was more
important than chasing the bad guy.

13:44.802 --> 13:47.444
Thanks.
You've always got my back.

13:47.512 --> 13:48.905
That's what friends do.

13:49.575 --> 13:50.890
Not always.

13:51.077 --> 13:55.233
I hate to say it, but
Hobgoblin is really Harry Osborn.

13:55.373 --> 13:57.093
Yeah. I kind of guessed that.

13:57.198 --> 13:59.537
His tech might be updated,
but it's still the same gear.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.696
Turns out all his anger at Spider-Man
may have caused him to snap.

14:02.764 --> 14:04.648
But I feel like
I need to help him.

14:04.786 --> 14:06.619
- You want me to come with you?
- No.

14:06.799 --> 14:08.632
Check to make sure
everyone here is okay.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.165
Besides, if I can't reach him on my own,

14:11.450 --> 14:13.790
Then I'm not the friend
I thought I was.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.674
I know this place.
Last time I was here,

14:19.784 --> 14:22.624
Norman Osborn had me trapped
next to Kraven the Hunter.

14:22.692 --> 14:24.057
There. I'm in.

14:24.221 --> 14:27.139
But if memory serves,
it was blown to bits.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.749
Looks like Harry's subconscious has
been doing more than fighting.

14:32.308 --> 14:34.252
It's also been redecorating.

14:38.159 --> 14:39.283
Whoa!

14:39.690 --> 14:40.880
Aahh!

14:40.987 --> 14:42.877
I'm surprised you
followed me, Spider-Man,

14:42.945 --> 14:45.174
knowing I'm the one
who will bring you down.

14:46.368 --> 14:48.614
Harry, we can work this
out together.

14:48.987 --> 14:50.866
Just let me help you!

14:52.236 --> 14:53.977
You've got it wrong, my friend.

14:54.062 --> 14:56.252
You're the one
who's going to need help.

14:57.237 --> 14:58.948
Hogging all the heroism.

14:59.016 --> 15:01.776
Taking all the credit
for curing Spider-Island.

15:03.219 --> 15:05.604
Well, tonight the lies end!

15:11.542 --> 15:14.339
Where am I?
Must've blacked out again.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.551
I'm going to find out who you are,
and expose your secret to the city!

15:18.619 --> 15:22.049
- Find out who I am?
- You're not Harry!

15:25.565 --> 15:28.854
Who is it, Spider-Man?
Who's been framing me?

15:32.745 --> 15:33.956
Norman?

15:34.039 --> 15:36.362
Dad! But...

15:38.767 --> 15:40.252
Harry?

15:43.146 --> 15:44.295
Why?

15:45.145 --> 15:47.737
To fulfill your destiny.

15:47.949 --> 15:50.539
I know you can become a hero, Harry.

15:50.763 --> 15:52.763
That's why I created
Oz Academy...

15:52.911 --> 15:55.552
To mold you,
to encourage you,

15:55.786 --> 15:58.904
to turn you into something better.

15:59.427 --> 16:02.628
That's why you got me suspended
from Horizon High, isn't it?

16:02.705 --> 16:05.110
So you could keep a closer eye on me.

16:05.475 --> 16:08.914
I couldn't let that fool
Max Modell destroy my legacy.

16:09.061 --> 16:11.074
You needed a true mentor,

16:11.214 --> 16:13.957
someone who could create
what this city needed...

16:13.959 --> 16:16.507
A new hero for the younger generation.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.388
But then Spider-Man showed up.

16:18.491 --> 16:21.406
Stole the very job
I envisioned for you!

16:21.621 --> 16:23.585
And now you're stealing it from me!

16:23.726 --> 16:27.218
I knew you didn't have the stomach
to destroy Spider-Man,

16:27.362 --> 16:29.624
so I decided to do it for you,

16:29.776 --> 16:32.765
knowing once he was gone,
you could take the credit.

16:33.044 --> 16:35.995
You're not doing this for me,
you're doing it for yourself!

16:36.132 --> 16:39.613
I'm doing it
for the Osborn name!

16:39.828 --> 16:41.639
Let him go, Norman!

16:46.831 --> 16:49.300
Once Spider-Man is gone,

16:49.368 --> 16:53.766
the world will know
that the Hobgoblin is their savior.

16:54.121 --> 16:55.988
Dad, no!

17:02.882 --> 17:04.969
I... No!

17:05.146 --> 17:08.223
Quickly, son.
We can still save ourselves.

17:08.401 --> 17:10.935
The Osborn legacy must survive!

17:11.031 --> 17:12.531
Harry, get me out of these.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.342
Harry, please.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.616
Come with me.
I'm your father.

17:30.188 --> 17:32.985
Now destroy Spider-Man.

17:33.642 --> 17:37.003
Fulfill the Osborn legacy.

17:37.832 --> 17:39.398
Harry, no.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.135
Don't do this!

17:47.597 --> 17:48.877
Huh?

17:52.223 --> 17:54.049
I can't, Dad.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.082
I mean... I won't.

17:57.620 --> 18:02.323
Then you've failed me,
and deserve what you've wrought!

18:05.567 --> 18:07.658
Aaahh!

18:08.259 --> 18:10.192
Dad!

18:17.781 --> 18:20.188
Harry, I am so sorry.

18:20.376 --> 18:22.265
We have to get out of here.

18:34.466 --> 18:39.073
Mr. Osborn?
Sir? Sir?

18:39.240 --> 18:42.151
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

18:42.338 --> 18:46.042
I still think of my father when
I hear that. Call me Harry.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.557
Very well... Harry.

18:48.803 --> 18:51.561
You have a few condolences
on your voice mail,

18:51.629 --> 18:53.668
and there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

18:53.772 --> 18:55.686
Oh, great. Send him in.

18:57.942 --> 19:01.622
I didn't know if your new schedule
left you time to meet me at Joe's,

19:01.875 --> 19:03.995
so I brought the smoothies to you.

19:04.191 --> 19:06.691
- Thanks, pal.
- How you doing?

19:08.127 --> 19:09.713
Okay, I guess.

19:10.674 --> 19:15.299
It's just... after everything
that's happened, I... I miss my father,

19:15.435 --> 19:18.162
and yet in some ways, I feel
like I never even knew him.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.323
And now I'm expected
to take over his position.

19:21.422 --> 19:23.174
It's enough to make
a person's head spin.

19:23.306 --> 19:27.440
Well, speaking scientifically,
the best way to fight dizziness

19:27.815 --> 19:30.463
is to focus on
the thing in front of you.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.072
You're right, Pete.

19:33.268 --> 19:35.065
Thanks for being such a
good friend.

19:35.302 --> 19:37.706
I hope the corporate world
takes to me like you do.

19:37.799 --> 19:42.229
Just be yourself, Harry.
That's all anyone expects.

19:43.113 --> 19:44.606
See you tomorrow.

19:52.979 --> 19:55.432
<i>- Congratulations, Harry.</i>
- What?

19:55.775 --> 19:58.159
<i>You're finally in
a position of power.</i>

19:58.366 --> 20:01.002
<i>You won't be in my shadow
anymore, son.</i>

20:01.075 --> 20:04.205
<i>I know you'll do great things
with the Osborn name.</i>

20:04.715 --> 20:08.760
<i>But to make sure,
I've left you some things...</i>

20:09.116 --> 20:10.619
<i>that might help.</i>

20:10.835 --> 20:14.893
I can't believe an entire
school year has passed already.

20:15.110 --> 20:18.779
Seems like yesterday you were worrying
whether you could even go here.

20:19.463 --> 20:23.127
I'm awfully proud of you,
Peter, and so is Uncle Ben.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.049
- I know.
- Peter.

20:33.361 --> 20:36.213
Would you look at that?
You're finally on time.

20:36.366 --> 20:38.002
Too bad the school year's over.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.622
I'm just here
to clean out my locker.

20:40.787 --> 20:42.775
Well, I'm glad I caught you.

20:42.843 --> 20:46.189
I wanted to tell you how far
I think you've come this year.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.963
Thanks, Max.

20:48.077 --> 20:50.260
It's a shame what happened
to your statue.

20:50.463 --> 20:53.564
Luckily, the workers can fix it while
they're putting up the new addition.

20:53.729 --> 20:57.033
- What new addition?
- The one of Spider-Man.

20:57.443 --> 21:02.431
- What? Really? But why?
- Well, the faculty decided

21:02.499 --> 21:04.981
he's done so much for the
students of Horizon High

21:05.049 --> 21:07.487
that he's practically
become our mascot.

21:07.555 --> 21:10.088
- So why not?
- Wow!

21:12.948 --> 21:14.996
Oh, come on!
You're ruining the image!

21:15.123 --> 21:17.667
- Shoo! Shoo!
- That's okay, Peter.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.815
It'll take more than that
to tarnish Spider-Man.

21:27.355 --> 21:29.340
I couldn't agree more.
