00:13.179 --> 00:14.247
[opening theme music playing]

00:48.415 --> 00:50.183
I'm Conquistador Sam,

00:50.250 --> 00:54.254
and I'mma sailin' the high seas, lookin' for untouched land.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.560
Bingo!

01:05.632 --> 01:09.736
I hereby claim this land as Sam-Merica.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.704
Okay, let's see, now.

01:11.771 --> 01:15.308
I think I'll start by putting a four lane highway right through here.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.776
No, ten lane.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.712
Then I'll put some fast food places right over there.

01:19.779 --> 01:24.117
And maybe a mini-mall down that way a mega-mall over yonder,

01:24.217 --> 01:27.120
and them, some regular sized malls in between.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.622
I'll cover every square inch of this land

01:29.722 --> 01:32.659
with good old fashion concrete.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.328
Ehh. You've got some interesting ideas, Doc.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.931
But I'm happy with my island the way it is.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.632
Your island?

01:39.732 --> 01:44.337
I discovered this land. You're trespassing on Sam-Merica.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.639
But I've lived here for 20 years.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.242
Them you own me 20 years of back taxes.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.778
This here flag, changes everything.

01:51.845 --> 01:55.315
So that little flag means you own the entire island now?

01:55.415 --> 01:56.516
Heck yeah, does.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.251
Does that include this piece of driftwood?

01:58.318 --> 01:59.619
Yep, that's mine.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.521
Does it also includes that little sea shell?

02:01.621 --> 02:02.689
Also mine.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.190
And this coconut tree?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.291
Mine too.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.027
What about this seaweed?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.195
Also mine.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.830
Well, how about this swamp rock?

02:10.930 --> 02:11.798
Mine again.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.765
And this one?

02:12.832 --> 02:14.134
That's mine too.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.603
Okay, okay. What about that one over there?

02:16.669 --> 02:18.204
Mine, mine, mine.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.006
[growling]

02:20.874 --> 02:22.208
Oh!

02:22.308 --> 02:24.344
[Sam screaming] Oh! Down! Down, gator!

02:24.444 --> 02:27.614
Well, whaddya know? That rock was a giant alligator the whole time!

02:27.680 --> 02:30.617
Maybe I need to get my eyes checked. [laughs]

02:30.683 --> 02:31.718
[struggling walla]

02:31.818 --> 02:33.853
Down! Down, gator!

02:33.953 --> 02:35.021
[Sam screaming]

02:37.724 --> 02:39.125
[panting]

02:41.828 --> 02:44.297
Ah! Beautiful view, ain't it?

02:44.364 --> 02:47.066
Here, why don't you have a closer look.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.034
[screams]

02:48.134 --> 02:50.136
Consider yourself deported.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.343
Hey, Doc. What do you think of my new ship?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.078
What? That's my ship.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.080
Not according to this flag.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.186
Be prepared to be boarded.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.829
Now. Get out and stay out.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.035
And take your stupid flag back too.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.740
Looks like the island is officially mine now.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.875
[Bugs] Thanks, Doc.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.010
[screaming] Ooh!

03:37.383 --> 03:39.786
I'll blast that critter's hide off.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.788
Yoo-hoo, up here.

03:42.622 --> 03:43.456
Grrr!

03:59.706 --> 04:00.607
Hey!

04:04.077 --> 04:07.080
Nice wall Doc, but what's it for?

04:07.146 --> 04:11.718
It's for keeping ugly, smelly varmints like you, out!

04:11.784 --> 04:14.087
But what if you need something from the outside world?

04:14.153 --> 04:16.990
I won't. I've got everything I needed in here.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.324
Yes, sir.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.760
Everything that I need is behind this wall.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.730
Everything except your wallet.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.599
My wallet?

04:26.666 --> 04:31.838
You heard me, Doc. Unless this belongs to another Conquistador Sam.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.973
Give me that back right now.

04:36.175 --> 04:40.079
I can't on account of this big sturdy wall.

04:40.146 --> 04:43.182
Ooh! Them I'mma comin' over.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.121
[siren wails]

04:48.187 --> 04:49.989
Identification, please.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.493
Ah, well, I don't have it on me.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.529
So, jumping the wall with no ID, huh?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.164
But this is my country.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.932
Tell it to the judge, pal.

05:05.505 --> 05:08.841
Order, order. Order in the court.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.944
So crossing the border with no ID, huh?

05:12.011 --> 05:14.180
This is a grave offense.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.717
-But I-- -No but. You'll get the chair for this.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.218
No. Not the chair.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.220
The chair!

05:21.321 --> 05:22.889
Can't we talk this over?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.524
Absolutely not.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.659
It's the chair all the way.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.295
No. Anything but the chair.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.730
Tell it to the chair.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.732
Now, sit down!

05:32.832 --> 05:34.300
And make yourself comfortable.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.903
Hey.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.338
Well, what do you think?

05:38.404 --> 05:39.906
This ain't half bad.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.042
Yeah, a fella can get used to this kind of treatment.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.044
And you haven't even reclined yet.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.579
Don't mind if I do.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.816
[Sam screaming]

05:49.882 --> 05:51.050
[water splashing]

05:54.687 --> 05:55.855
Well, that's that.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.491
Hey, what gives?

05:58.558 --> 06:01.427
This time you're out of here for good, rabbit.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.262
Adios, amigo.

[Bugs Bunny screaming]

06:04.864 --> 06:05.698
Ouch!

06:07.867 --> 06:10.269
Enjoy your new island rabbit.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.874
Well, I guess this is it.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.210
I better get used to eat clams.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.911
Hey, a pearl.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.715
Looks like something else is down here too.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.018
Wow! A treasure chest.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.255
What's this?

06:29.355 --> 06:31.090
Another treasure chest?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.628
[stuttering] Two treasure chests?

06:35.728 --> 06:39.132
And another? This situation couldn't get any better.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.969
Whoo! Hi, Mr. Bunny, wanna party with us?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.605
Well, I don't see why not.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.407
Party Cruise?

06:48.641 --> 06:50.810
It don't get much better than this.

[Bugs Bunny cheering]

06:55.214 --> 06:56.115
What?

06:56.215 --> 06:57.417
Talk about lucky.

07:01.921 --> 07:06.125
Oh no, you don't. This is Sam-Merica territory now.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.660
We're switching places.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.730
I'm staying here forever.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.398
Goodbye key.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.334
Now, scram, rabbit. Let's kick this party up a notch.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.903
[whooping triumphantly]

07:19.105 --> 07:20.940
Enjoy your new island, Doc.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.412
I'll you stinky rabbit?

07:26.479 --> 07:28.614
This island is the greatest.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.350

Well, it's time to put the cat out.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.855
[grunts] Come on, Sylvester.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.390
You know the drill.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.727
