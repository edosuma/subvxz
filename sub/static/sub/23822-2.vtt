That's the refrigerator,
Gary.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.933
Really? Because
I've had some serious,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.568
dark conversations
with that thing.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.705
I knows
everything about me.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.841

21:03.363 --> 21:04.729
As real as it gets,
baby.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.431
Then I promise you,
we will get your son back.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.699
And keep Mooncake safe.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.067
And murder
that guy's face off.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.535
I don't think
that's a great idea.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.938
