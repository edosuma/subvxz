00:37.560 --> 00:39.440
MOMMY- COME HOME
GUZMÁN- WHERE ARE YOU?

00:56.800 --> 00:57.680
Excuse me.

00:58.040 --> 00:58.920
Darling.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.800
Everything is going to be fine. All right?

01:40.080 --> 01:42.440
All three heads
of the construction company are accused

01:42.520 --> 01:45.240
of alleged embezzlement of public funds,

01:45.320 --> 01:47.120
bribery, and criminal negligence.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.120
Shit, poor people.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.960
That's us. At least I stole to eat,
unlike these rich people.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.760
I meant their families.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.600
But, of course,

01:57.320 --> 01:59.480
you wouldn't understand that, huh?

02:00.440 --> 02:01.920
Always a mean comment.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.880
-Have you talked to Marina?
-No.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.160
You should talk to her.
She must be having a terrible time.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.240
Poor girl.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.680
-Hello.
-Hello.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.440
-Don't worry, man.
-Really, don't.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
It's OK.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.040
It's pre-trial detention.
We pay bail, and he's out.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.920
-And how much is it?
-Three hundred thousand.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.440
-We'll pay this afternoon.
-And the trial?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.480
It doesn't matter. They have nothing.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.640
-Then why did they accuse him?
-I don't know, Ander. Shit, I don't know!

02:40.720 --> 02:43.600
Some judge wanted to be on the news,
no fucking idea!

02:47.800 --> 02:50.400
They have nothing against him, OK?
They have no proof.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.560
That's what your dad says, Carla.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.880
Come on, we come in peace, Christian.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.320
Yeah, being called a thief
makes me feel awesome.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.800
We're saying that
if it was you who took the watches,

03:05.880 --> 03:07.000
we really don't care.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.080
Return them, and we forget about it.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.160
How can I forget
what I know nothing about?

03:14.000 --> 03:14.880
How are you?

03:16.400 --> 03:20.760
Not well, I'm not gonna lie to you.
Samuel, I don't want to talk now.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.560
Christian, we only care about one watch.
The one with a red leather strap.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.880
It was my grandfather's.
He died last Christmas.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.400
-My father is very attached to it.
-Can you listen?

03:31.760 --> 03:32.600
Yes.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.160
Sorry. Um...

03:35.600 --> 03:37.680
-Want to talk later?
-Whenever you want.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.880
If it shows up tomorrow in my desk,
we'll forget about it.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.280
Enough already. Why me?

03:42.360 --> 03:45.000
-Am I the only one who's been there?
-You're the only one--

03:45.080 --> 03:46.640
Who is penniless, right?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.920
-And that makes me a thief!
-I didn't say that.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.960
-We all know rich people don't steal.
-Christian, when did I say that?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.760
Carla, are you all right?

04:01.800 --> 04:02.640
What is it?

04:03.960 --> 04:06.440
-Your grandfather isn't dead.
-How much did you hear?

04:14.760 --> 04:18.480
All of it.
Except why that watch is so important.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.600
It's a pen drive, with documents.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.680
Don't tell your brother, OK?

04:24.560 --> 04:27.800
Papers from the business my father
and yours have.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.480
If they were to fall
into the wrong hands right now...

04:32.560 --> 04:34.360
-Stay calm, Carla--
-No.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.640
DON'T GIVE THEM THE WATCH
WITH THE RED LEATHER STRAP

05:08.040 --> 05:09.160
What are you doing?

05:10.800 --> 05:11.960
Reading comments.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.200
Babe, that's the first thing
you should stop doing. OK?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.080
Hey.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.440
What's up with you?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.840
Does your religion not allow you
to console your friends?

05:39.480 --> 05:43.200
Or maybe you can't forgive him
for sleeping with me again.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.040
Really!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.920
I don't care about what you two have.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.280
My dear...
Now that you've taken the veil off,

05:53.360 --> 05:56.680
you should consider removing
that blindfold.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.000
-Guzmán and I--
-Let's see if you get it.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.680
The only man
I'm interested in right now...

06:01.920 --> 06:03.400
is called Dostoevsky.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.480
But, of course, every time there's a man,
even if he's been dead for a century,

06:08.640 --> 06:10.920
you can't help getting in the middle, huh?

06:11.320 --> 06:14.440
He died in 1881. He's been dead 137 years.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.120
You've convinced me.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.600
It's obvious
you don't give a shit about Guzmán.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.440
OMAR, CAN YOU COME TO THE SCHOOL?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.720
Give me a moment, man.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.080
Hey! What are you doing here?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
Are you stupid?

06:54.360 --> 06:56.720
-Hi, by the way.
-You know who Marina's brother is?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.840
You know what he might do if he finds out?

06:58.920 --> 07:01.120
-I don't care, I need the money.
-Omar.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.840
What for? What do you want?

07:02.920 --> 07:05.880
-What do you care?
-I care about you, idiot!

07:05.960 --> 07:07.360
I don't want you to...

07:07.760 --> 07:11.720
To end up in jail or worse
for a pair of sneakers, or a motorbike.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.760
I already live in a fucking jail.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.960
This! This dough will set me free.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.960
I need it to leave home.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.040
Do you understand now?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.080
-Omar.
-Let go.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.320
Omar!

07:30.800 --> 07:31.680
Marina.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.120
I wanted to talk to you.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.200
-Sure.
-How are you?

07:37.280 --> 07:38.960
Fine. Well, better.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.080
I'm glad.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.680
I wanted to tell you that we are here
for anything you need.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.240
-Are you OK?
-Mm-hmm.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.200
Now it's exam time,
we'll do everything we can--

07:52.440 --> 07:53.280
Oh, dear!

07:54.520 --> 07:55.880
-Do you have a tissue?
-No!

08:00.400 --> 08:01.720
Open your locker, Marina.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.800
-I'll have to talk to your mother.
<i>-</i>No. She can't deal with another problem.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.040
I don't know, we've all fucked up
at some point, right?

08:17.120 --> 08:20.800
It would be a shame that for one mistake,
no matter how big,

08:21.920 --> 08:24.560
everything went to hell, right, Martín?

08:33.320 --> 08:36.960
Let's see,
Marina is an exemplary student, Azucena.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.280
And we should consider the circumstances,
right?

08:40.560 --> 08:43.880
This could stay between us.
But, it can't happen again.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.600
OK, but to ensure that,
we need to nip it in the bud.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.320
Who sold it?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.120
-What?
-Your dealer.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.280
The one who didn't hesitate
to sell drugs to a minor at school.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.880
I don't know. He never mentioned his name.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.760
You have his number in your cell.
Didn't you text him to meet?

09:03.840 --> 09:04.840
Your phone.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.200
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO THEM

09:12.600 --> 09:14.200
-No.
-Marina, this is serious.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.440
I only need a name.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
Marina, give me the phone! Marina!

09:19.160 --> 09:20.800
-I can't.
-Give it to me!

09:20.880 --> 09:23.040
I'll give you a name,
but don't report him.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.360
Give me the phone.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.440
Omar!

09:27.440 --> 09:29.920
His name is Omar. He's Nadia's brother.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.360
I think this is all getting
a bit out of control.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.760
I can't have a student blackmailing me
whenever she pleases.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.560
I can't jeopardize my job.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.920
-I can't, I'm sorry.
-Of course. What a pity.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.360
Too late. The stork is on its way!

09:48.880 --> 09:51.400
Of course, you're worried about Marina.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.480
Don't worry, she will not talk.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.840
If she does,
let me remind you that you and I

09:55.920 --> 09:59.520
are on this boat together,
and would go down... together.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.360
Besides, do you think I'll let her talk?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.680
You have everything
you could wish to be happy.

10:08.760 --> 10:13.320
Why get into this mess for a shitty trophy
and a scholarship you don't need?

10:13.400 --> 10:14.280
I don't get you.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.840
Martín, do you know why I am thin?

10:18.040 --> 10:18.880
Excuse me?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.880
Because I always see myself fat.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.680
Do you know why I'm the best?
Because I'm never satisfied.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.240
You should learn to be content
with what you have to be happy.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.400
Are you happy earning €1,000 a month?

10:32.480 --> 10:34.760
Repeating the same shit
in class every day?

10:36.640 --> 10:39.120
Besides, who wants to be happy nowadays?

10:39.320 --> 10:40.640
When they can be the best.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.280
Right? Have a good day!

10:48.280 --> 10:50.760
You couldn't wait to tell me
whatever it is at home?

10:50.840 --> 10:51.920
No.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.800
Who sold you the marijuana in your room?
Was it Omar?

11:03.480 --> 11:04.320
No.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.200
It was a girl.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.920
Blonde, bleached hair. And fat.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.200
I mean, overweight.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.600
I only saw her once.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.520
Why? Is something wrong?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.440
We caught Marina with marijuana
that this Omar sold her.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.000
He's Nadia's brother.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.680
-No idea.
-Anyway, I'll have to talk to the parents.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.080
I NEED IT, IT'S IMPORTANT

11:41.600 --> 11:43.480
WHY? WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT?

11:43.560 --> 11:44.400
Fuck, Nano.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.040
What's going on with that watch?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.640
Thank you!

11:57.720 --> 11:59.240
Sorry I got you mixed up in this!

11:59.840 --> 12:00.920
No problem.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.080
It's no sweat off my dick
if those snobs think I'm a thief!

12:04.160 --> 12:06.360
What matters is you're out of debt.
It's over!

12:06.440 --> 12:08.280
Now you can begin to enjoy life.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.240
Working 40 hours and sweating like a pig

12:11.320 --> 12:14.160
for a shitty salary
that doesn't even cover rent.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
To enjoying life!

12:15.680 --> 12:17.680
No, Nano,
you and I are going to strike gold.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.960
-Really? How?
-Yes.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.600
-Hello.
-Hi.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.320
Christian, can you leave us alone?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.360
Sure,
want me to make you a sandwich?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.520
No, please leave.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.960
-Here.
-Thanks.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.400
Are you OK?

12:41.120 --> 12:43.360
Yes, but I'm a bit dizzy. It's OK.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.440
We have to figure out
how to return the watch.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.800
If it's so important,
how much would they pay for it?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.240
What?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.600
If their lives depend on that watch,
how much would they pay?

12:57.680 --> 12:58.760
That's blackmail.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.120
-Yes.
-Have you lost your mind?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.920
No, I'm using it! This can be my chance
to escape this shit.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.360
Or to go back to prison.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.720
-It's going to work.
-Sure.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.280
-Your plans never fail.
-So help.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.120
I have the balls, you the brains.
We go 50/50.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.080
We tell them if they don't pay,
we go to the press.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
Do you know what would happen
if those papers got published?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.200
To those rich people?

13:16.280 --> 13:18.160
-Why worry about them?
-I worry about Marina.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.120
Me, too.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.920
She's your girlfriend.
I don't want anything to happen to her.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.080
And we aren't giving
that watch to anybody.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.280
We bluff so they pay up.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.440
-Marina Nunier?
-Yes.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
Are you a relative?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.640
-Yes, I'm her boyfriend.
-Then you need to hear this.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.560
The tests say you are pregnant.
About four weeks.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.480
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.440
It's OK, no problem.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.120
We were not together four weeks ago.
It's OK.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.400
Whose is it?

14:09.480 --> 14:10.320
Huh?

14:13.040 --> 14:15.160
Don't worry, you can tell me.
Whose is it?

14:19.160 --> 14:20.600
No, I can't, Samuel.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.400
I have to get out of here.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.320
Hey.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.480
Shit, he's not answering. He's super mad.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.480
Polo, it can't be Christian.
He wouldn't risk what he has with us

14:50.560 --> 14:52.280
for watches
when he doesn't know their value.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.560
OK, so now what? Do we apologize?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.000
It's better if you go.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.880
-He's mad at me over the photo shoot.
-And if we get him another one?

15:03.160 --> 15:05.440
-This time for real, no nonsense.
-Carla, really...

15:05.840 --> 15:07.320
Polo, we owe it to him.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.360
And you owe him.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.280
Now more than ever.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.480
How are you?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.600
-How are you, man?
-Fine.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.280
Glad to see you.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.200
I came to see if there's anything
I can do for you.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.760
-Do you have 300,000 bucks?
-Guzmán.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.000
Please.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.880
-Hi.
-Hello.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.920
We don't have the money.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.200
Not for the bail,
not for the lawyers, nothing.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.520
Our accounts are empty.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.160
We are penniless.
Dad left us with nothing.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.040
So I guess he's going to spend
the next 20 years in fucking jail.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.200
-And she's so calm, I don't get it.
-That's enough.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.600
-Why don't you ask for help at a bank?
-Nobody wants to be linked to us now.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.720
What about a friend with money?

15:55.360 --> 15:58.600
Nobody wants to call us.
Not even Carla's father.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.080
And he's Dad's partner. My godfather.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.720
And our consultant.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.400
-That's how toxic we are, Mom.
-Maybe we should call them.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.360
Marina betraying your boyfriend
can't have been nice for you.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.280
I hated her a lot for that.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.640
Because of her...

16:21.480 --> 16:23.000
Because of her, Omar and I...

16:24.720 --> 16:25.560
<i>It's about Omar.</i>

16:26.320 --> 16:28.200
I need you to say you got mixed up,

16:28.280 --> 16:31.720
that it wasn't him who sold you the pot.
I need you to talk to my mother.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.560
Ander, you know she won't buy it.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.400
-I'm really sorry.
-Yes, but--

16:37.160 --> 16:38.480
You don't know his father.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.160
-I'm sorry.
-Marina!

16:41.240 --> 16:43.200
What are you doing? Let me go.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.200
Do you want your mother to hear
about this morning?

16:52.480 --> 16:56.640
And do you want my brother to hear
why you've come this afternoon?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.240
Let go!

17:09.400 --> 17:11.760
Nadia, help us. There's a lot of work.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.840
I'm coming. I have to study.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.520
Right.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.560
Don't argue.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.360
I'M REALLY SORRY. I TRIED.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.480
Hello.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.880
Yes, Principal.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.680
Yes, of course.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.760
My husband can go tomorrow.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.080
What is it about?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.360
I see.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.040
Better in person.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.160
All right. Goodbye.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.720
What is it this time?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.600
-Did you skip class again?
-No.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.240
-Then why do I have to go tomorrow?
-Yusef.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.520
That was the principal of Nadia's school.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.120
I am as surprised as you.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.640
First the hijab.
Let's see what they come up with now.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.560
Forgive me, son.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.520
I know you are changing, maturing.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.360
I also know you are going
to make me proud.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.480
Aren't you?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.720
What are you listening to?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.200
Oh, baby, you look terrible!

19:19.640 --> 19:20.480
I know.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.480
Let me help you.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.880
I have a great product for those dreadful
dark circles under your eyes.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.880
-Leave it.
-Look at me.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.160
You know you can count on me, right?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.320
And I will not breathe a word.

19:37.400 --> 19:42.200
Really. I won't go around gossiping.
As it should be.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.120
Lu, save your breath
and ask me straight up.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.920
I told you about Martín
and my blackmail in confidence.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.800
And friends do not betray each other.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.320
We are not friends.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.200
It's in your best interest to be mine.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.160
Ready.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.360
You look better.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.480
You look prettier when you don't talk.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.000
Do you think after what he's done
I will visit him in jail?

20:16.440 --> 20:17.520
I don't know.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.400
He deserves a chance, doesn't he?
To explain himself.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.680
And he's your father.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.600
He's a thief.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.440
He even stole from his family,
so he doesn't deserve anything.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.320
What he deserves,
that's for a judge to decide.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.760
Your family should always be your support.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.280
-What is it good for, if not?
-You really think I should go?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.960
I think it's what he would do for you.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.000
Come on, Christian.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.720
It would be a photo shoot this afternoon,
same place. Polo will be with you.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.600
Of course,
to make sure I don't steal any socks.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.480
To make sure this time
there are no problems with the list.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.840
Do you forgive us?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.400
Well, let's see...

21:04.640 --> 21:06.600
when I hold the magazine,

21:06.680 --> 21:09.200
hot off the presses
and with my photo on it...

21:09.280 --> 21:10.160
maybe.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.080
-Beautiful.
-Forgive us.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.640
-It's OK.
-All good?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.800
Yeah.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
Are you OK?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.760
Yes, I think I'm going to be sick.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.320
What's up with the hippie now?

21:44.400 --> 21:48.440
No idea. She doesn't tell me anything now.
Our friendship lasted about five minutes.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.840
What a coincidence.
Just when the watches went missing.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.520
What are you saying?
Why would Marina rob us?

21:54.600 --> 21:58.160
Come on, Carla.
As if her family had no criminal history.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.680
You're just miffed
about the thing with Martín.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.640
Dear, that only confirms
that this girl is not to be trusted.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.640
If I were you, I'd keep an eye on her.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.040
What can you tell me about these messages?

22:13.760 --> 22:15.880
I wanted to know
if she knew about the theft.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.960
There's no record
of your dad reporting it.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.800
It wasn't such a big deal.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.000
They were valued at over €100,000.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.320
And judging by how insistent you were
with Marina, it seemed like a big deal.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.720
Most of all, when you asked
about the one with the red leather strap.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.520
Yes, well, it's just that...

22:34.600 --> 22:36.400
I wanted to help my father.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.120
That watch had sentimental value to him.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.240
It belonged to a friend of his
who passed not long ago.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.880
-This is the girls' room!
-I'll be quick.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.080
What?

22:53.920 --> 22:55.080
Are you all right?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.840
-Is that what you want to know?
-We weren't together.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.800
It doesn't matter.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.800
But please,
tell me if it's somebody I know.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.960
If you don't care, why keep asking?

23:05.040 --> 23:07.960
And if I don't care about the answer,
why don't you just tell me?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.360
Do you really want to know?

23:13.640 --> 23:15.080
Samuel, let's drop it.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.400
It was a mistake. Period.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.120
-At least there's a solution.
-You're getting an abortion?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.200
Samuel.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.800
-What?
-This is the girls' locker room.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.640
Samuel, go, please.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.240
Shit.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.240
Do your parents know?

23:42.600 --> 23:45.000
No, it's not really
the best moment to tell them.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.480
-Can I borrow your cell phone?
-Yes, of course.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.040
This is the number...

23:55.880 --> 23:56.720
for a clinic.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.400
Many Muslim girls use it.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.840
They don't ask for authorization.
Even if you're a minor.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.200
-But, Nadia, do you approve of me--
-No.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.560
But if you are going to do it,
I'd rather a doctor helps you.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.000
-An underground doctor.
-It's safe.

24:14.040 --> 24:14.880
Believe me.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.480
It worked for my sister.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.480
She asked me to go with her.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.720
I held her hand
all the way there on the bus.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.720
I tried to talk her out of it.

24:36.040 --> 24:36.920
But I think...

24:38.080 --> 24:39.760
I only made her feel worse.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.600
Feel like a murderer.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.760
After that,
she never... confided in me again.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.880
If you're going through with it,

24:51.800 --> 24:53.760
you need someone to hold your hand.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.960
Thank you, Nadia.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.120
And...

25:05.280 --> 25:08.880
And... forgive me for not saying anything
to you yesterday.

25:10.120 --> 25:14.760
I was busy with the exam, and...
Marina, that's very important to me.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.760
I need that scholarship.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.480
Nadia... I am truly sorry.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.200
That scholarship is granted,
and not to you.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.320
No. How?

25:29.720 --> 25:31.400
-Marina.
-Guzmán,

25:31.480 --> 25:33.880
this is the girls' locker room,
and I'm fine.

25:34.280 --> 25:39.520
I'm going to Soto del Real this afternoon.
Mom made it clear she's not going.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.640
Are you?

25:41.800 --> 25:45.600
OK. Tell Dad I said to go to hell.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.640
You and Mom both.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.480
If you want, I can go with you.

26:04.000 --> 26:04.840
Hi, Dad.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.640
And your mother?

26:14.720 --> 26:17.840
-And your sister, how are they?
-They are thinking of you.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.680
Mostly after seeing your bank accounts.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.280
Guzmán.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.920
We needed the cash.
We had problems with the company.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.600
But we'll make it all back,
and more.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.920
Do you understand?

26:33.480 --> 26:34.880
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.760
Are you sure
you haven't spent it all on coke?

26:45.920 --> 26:46.880
Shit.

26:58.040 --> 26:58.880
Don't worry.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.120
It's going to be all right.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.760
Is it mine?

27:17.920 --> 27:18.840
Is it mine?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.160
Marina, wait.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.560
-What do you want to do?
-I don't know.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.680
What do you need me to do?

27:30.640 --> 27:32.840
Maybe I need somebody to hold my hand.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.600
-Will it hurt?
-No way.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.080
It's going to be fine.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.360
Don't say that.
I hate it when people say that.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.480
-Hey, it was you who wanted to come.
-What else can I do?

27:46.560 --> 27:49.880
-Give me one reason not to do it.
-I could give you plenty to do it.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.840
You are too young.
You'll have time to have children.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.320
And where would you--
Where would we go with a child?

27:57.120 --> 27:59.120
It's the most sensible thing to do, but...

28:01.080 --> 28:01.960
But what?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.440
But nothing.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.680
-Tell me.
-Nothing.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.680
-Nano, tell me, really.
-It's nothing.

28:10.960 --> 28:11.800
Nothing.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.000
What is it, Nano?

28:37.960 --> 28:42.800
-I'm leaving this shitty town.
-What does that have to do with me?

28:46.000 --> 28:46.840
You and I?

28:49.360 --> 28:52.680
Nano, I am a minor,
and you just got out of jail.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.040
-Not to mention the HIV.
-You are undetectable, Marina.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.240
The chances of the child being infected
are less than one percent.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
I don't have a master's on this,
I googled it.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.160
We could go someplace where we could
make a fresh start...

29:04.240 --> 29:07.120
-where you can continue treatment.
-Where?

29:07.200 --> 29:11.040
Far. The farthest the money I'll get
for that watch will take us.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.840
Nano, if I were to leave with you,

29:14.640 --> 29:17.440
it would never be
by extorting my family and their friends.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.760
-Is that how you want to start a new life?
-No, I want a fresh start, with you.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.640
I want to go where nobody knows us.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.480
Where nobody knows about our screwups.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.360
-Or what we've done to Samuel, Marina.
-I won't tell Samuel the truth.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.720
-That would only hurt him more.
-If you come with me, he'll find out.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.680
-Nano, this is crazy.
-I know.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
I'm not stupid,
I know how the world works.

29:45.560 --> 29:49.600
But I also know that...
this, the worst that could happen to us,

29:49.680 --> 29:51.920
may be the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.160
I'm not asking you to say yes now.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.240
But think about it
for longer than five minutes.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.560
And... if--

30:22.360 --> 30:23.880
This is not a yes, OK?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.200
You still have four minutes.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.640
-Look at all this glamour!
-Carlos, how are you?

30:31.840 --> 30:34.360
-Shall I change over here?
-Yes, right here.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.760
Mary, let's start
with the color block outfit.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.920
How about we celebrate
when you are done here?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.680
We have a math exam tomorrow.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.160
It's not like you'll pass.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.760
That's also true, no arguments here.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.240
-I'll let Carla know.
-OK.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.000
Hi, hon. Everything's good here.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.400
But we are really tired
and we have to study.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.720
Better if we celebrate some other day, OK?

31:09.360 --> 31:10.520
Love you, bye.

31:11.920 --> 31:12.760
Are you OK?

31:14.800 --> 31:15.680
Better.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.280
Thanks to you.

31:18.520 --> 31:19.760
It's no big deal.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.080
It is, we have an exam tomorrow.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.640
And you risk getting a measly nine for me.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.560
Seems like you do care for me a bit, huh?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.320
Don't get excited, we are just friends.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.600
I know.

31:37.000 --> 31:37.840
I don't...

31:40.040 --> 31:41.560
I don't want to be your friend.

31:43.800 --> 31:47.800
Well, you'll have to get used
to not getting everything you want.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.360
That's too bad.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.200
Because I've never wanted something
so much.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.880
I bet I'm not the first girl
you've said that to.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.320
No.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.040
But you are the first one
with whom I mean it.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.160
Yes.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.040
See you in class.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.400
Look.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.640
They are great, man!

32:41.080 --> 32:42.560
Amazing photos!

32:42.640 --> 32:44.000
That one I don't like.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.680
I overdid the intensity.
I look cross-eyed.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.000
-So, shall we go out and party?
-Somewhere else?

32:51.720 --> 32:55.120
We can stay here as long as we want.
And there's free beer.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.160
And the marchioness?

32:58.480 --> 32:59.520
She texted.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.960
She can't come, has to study.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.280
Come on, so do I!

33:04.840 --> 33:07.880
What would you do that for?
You're going to be a supermodel.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.160
Quit joking, man. Don't mess with me.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.040
Christian, I mean it.
You've taken the first step.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.320
What's left is the hard part,
getting the cover.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.200
And how do we get the cover?

33:17.600 --> 33:18.800
We talk to the publisher.

33:19.360 --> 33:23.000
-And what a coincidence, she's my mother.
-Imagine that, what a coincidence.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.920
Don't worry, and listen to me.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.480
It won't be easy, let me tell you.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.880
But I think you have what it takes.

33:30.960 --> 33:35.200
Yeah? I don't have abs,
but I can start going to the gym.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.520
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

33:40.040 --> 33:43.200
-Here's what I think.
<i>-</i>Damn, don't think that much, OK?

33:43.280 --> 33:45.320
And see if we can get
the magazine cover.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.440
-Hey!
-That's up to you.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.240
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

34:12.960 --> 34:15.440
-What?
-Son of a bitch! My dick.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.160
OPEN

34:27.240 --> 34:28.080
Dad?

34:28.520 --> 34:30.880
Why is the store closed? It's not ten yet.

34:37.080 --> 34:37.920
Hello?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.960
-What's the matter?
-Did you know?

34:46.040 --> 34:48.640
-Huh?
-Did you know what your brother sold?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.840
Don't lie to me, Nadia! Not you!

34:53.320 --> 34:55.520
We've had too many lies in this house!

34:56.360 --> 34:59.600
How many things haven't you told me?
And where have you been? It's late.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.680
I was with Guzmán.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.240
Wasn't it enough to have him
at home the other day?

35:06.880 --> 35:09.240
What did I tell you
about seeing that boy again?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.000
Forbidden.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.560
It's my fault.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.480
It's my fault!

35:17.800 --> 35:18.960
Too much freedom!

35:19.760 --> 35:20.720
But it's over!

35:20.800 --> 35:21.760
Go!

35:40.720 --> 35:43.480
<i>Nadia, I think you deserve</i>
<i>to know the truth.</i>

35:43.920 --> 35:46.120
<i>Lu has done Martín a huge favor,</i>

35:46.560 --> 35:48.640
and that's why the scholarship
will go to her.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.040
Can you read what you replied
that same night?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.480
You have ruined my brother's life...

35:58.080 --> 35:58.920
and mine.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.600
Why are you still up?

36:08.680 --> 36:10.720
I can't stop thinking about something.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.200
Who the father of Marina's baby is.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.080
And when I think of it,
only one person comes to mind.

36:17.960 --> 36:18.840
You.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.760
She helped you with the theft.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.680
So you've been talking.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.080
-Maybe even seeing each other.
-You think I'd do that to you?

36:28.360 --> 36:29.600
Is that your answer?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.000
No, it isn't.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.360
My answer is this. Fuck you!

36:41.080 --> 36:43.120
Forgive me, man. I'm losing my mind.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.640
I don't know what to think anymore.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.280
-And? Have you talked to your mom?
<i>-</i>About what?

37:04.160 --> 37:06.280
Sorry, I don't speak English.
About the cover!

37:06.360 --> 37:07.720
Do you know what that is?

37:07.960 --> 37:11.040
-They don't give covers to just anybody.
-I'm not just anybody.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.080
Right?

37:12.640 --> 37:13.640
Um, look...

37:13.840 --> 37:16.160
She's right that it's complicated.
I told you that.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.120
What are you saying?

37:19.600 --> 37:20.440
To class.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.680
Christian.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.680
Christian, please.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.600
-I told you I'd try.
-My ass!

37:29.880 --> 37:33.560
I didn't accept last night so you'd try.
Don't fuck with me, I'm not an idiot!

37:33.640 --> 37:35.560
What does last night have to do
with the cover?

37:36.360 --> 37:39.920
-I think there's been a misunderstanding.
-I think you are a son of a bitch.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.320
You thought I offered you the cover
in exchange for sucking my dick?

37:45.520 --> 37:46.560
And you accepted.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.840
Well, I don't know what that makes me,
but do you know what it makes you?

37:52.920 --> 37:53.920
What?

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
-A wh--
-A what?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.440
-A wh--
-Son of a bitch!

38:06.040 --> 38:06.880
Good morning.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.200
Um...

38:10.800 --> 38:13.360
I've called the agency
and canceled the adoption.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.880
What did your wife say?

38:17.520 --> 38:20.120
-She agrees. What else could she say?
-I see.

38:20.200 --> 38:24.000
What values would we be teaching our child
if we got it by cheating?

38:24.360 --> 38:26.200
What kind of parents would we have been?

38:27.640 --> 38:29.040
I think we'll never know.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.240
Hey.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.560
Shouldn't you be studying?

38:41.680 --> 38:46.960
We were at his mother's studio,
and he starts kissing me on the neck,

38:47.040 --> 38:49.760
unbuttons my shirt,
takes my belt off, and grabs my dick.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.560
-Really?
-Sure.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.520
Omar told me.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.680
Marina got caught,
and then gave him away, yes.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.040
I guess to save herself.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.920
-She hasn't told you either?
-Me?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.600
She's driving me crazy.

39:11.040 --> 39:14.160
-She's made me doubt even my brother.
-What? But why?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.480
I'll tell you later.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.080
-How do you feel about the exam?
-What does it matter?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.400
What do you mean? And the scholarship?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.280
They can't give it to me
if I don't go to this school.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.960
It was hard enough to get my dad
to let me finish the school year.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.680
Nadia, what happened?

40:01.680 --> 40:02.520
Hello, everybody.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.640
So, the day is finally here.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.920
Only pens on your desks, please.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.680
-Done.
-Finished?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.760
-Sure?
-Yes.

40:46.240 --> 40:50.400
Guys, keep working in silence.
Nobody move, please!

40:50.600 --> 40:51.480
Marina!

40:52.280 --> 40:54.640
Marina, what is it?

40:54.720 --> 40:55.640
Nothing.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.560
-Not nothing. What's this?
-Nothing. I don't know it.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.960
Samuel, what are you doing?

41:03.040 --> 41:05.920
I want to assure you
there won't be any favoritism.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.400
Is it about our issue?

41:08.480 --> 41:09.920
Martín, I just want to go home.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.680
I want to settle this problem, OK?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.040
What?

41:14.400 --> 41:16.000
-Son of a bitch.
-Have you told him?

41:16.080 --> 41:18.680
-Bastard.
-What are you doing?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.400
-Calm down!
-What's happening?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.520
He took advantage of his student
and got her pregnant!

41:22.600 --> 41:23.640
-What?
-What?

41:23.720 --> 41:26.080
-Martín?
-Azucena, do you think I'd do that?

41:27.640 --> 41:29.760
And accepting a bribe, that you would do?

41:33.760 --> 41:34.640
My office.

41:38.080 --> 41:38.960
Fuck!

41:39.040 --> 41:40.880
Bribe him, me? Please!

41:42.000 --> 41:45.840
-How can she invent such a fantasy?
-It was you who told me.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.280
Really,
she's crazier than she already was.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.560
It's her word against mine.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.200
-Please, with this girl's history...
-Marina's telling the truth.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.480
Excuse me?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.440
We made a deal,
but today I told Lucrecia that--

42:01.520 --> 42:02.720
You're fired, Martín.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.480
Don't make it any harder.
We'll send your belongings home.

42:12.120 --> 42:12.960
Fine.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.240
It's very clear that I had
nothing to do with this, right? That...

42:21.320 --> 42:22.640
That I didn't do anything.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.480
Denying it only insults my intelligence.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.720
And earns you two months of suspension
instead of one.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.080
We are in the middle of exams.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.000
You will sit your exams in September.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.960
-How did you do on the exam?
-Well.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.640
We changed plans at the last minute.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.880
I didn't want to bother you
while you studied.

43:00.680 --> 43:04.000
Thanks for not telling me you were
fucking another so I'd stay focused.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.120
Hey, you fucked him too, OK?

43:09.360 --> 43:10.200
OK, I'm sorry.

43:12.120 --> 43:15.680
Always with you.
That was the deal. To share everything.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.720
Carla, really, it was nothing.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.360
It was nothing!

43:20.640 --> 43:21.880
Come, give me a hug.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.240
-Carla, I didn't even like it.
-This...

43:26.800 --> 43:30.040
was something we did to avoid infidelity,
lies.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.120
To revive a relationship that was dead.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.680
But given all this,
it's better if it remains buried.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.440
-Hello.
-Hi.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.040
-Let's go.
-No.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.120
One fifty, please.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.080
I need change.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.880
-Why don't you answer my texts?
-I no longer have a cell.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.960
-And when can we meet?
-I'll be behind this counter for 2 years.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.440
-Omar.
-What are you doing?

44:30.920 --> 44:31.760
Thanks.

44:44.680 --> 44:45.560
Omar, please.

44:48.080 --> 44:48.920
Please.

44:49.000 --> 44:49.880
I can't.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.160
Have a good day.

44:57.080 --> 44:57.960
Bye.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.480
Do you want to know whose it is?

45:18.560 --> 45:20.960
-Do you really need to know?
-No. Marina.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.040
Enough.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.320
I'm tired.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.360
I'm tired of chasing after you.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.920
-Maybe--
-Listen to me! Please.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.200
I'm tired of trying all the time
to convince you about us.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.120
But most of all,
I'm tired of waiting for you to find...

45:34.200 --> 45:36.840
the fucking courage to break up with me!

45:38.600 --> 45:39.640
Samuel.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.280
How would you have reacted
if she had decided to end it with you?

45:45.920 --> 45:48.080
I don't know, because that never happened.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.400
I have never seen this message.

45:59.920 --> 46:00.840
She wrote it.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.640
She never hit the send button.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.560
Read it, please.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.040
"Nano,

46:11.480 --> 46:12.400
forgive me,

46:15.480 --> 46:17.000
but I can't do this.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.560
I can't leave, I'm sorry."

46:20.880 --> 46:22.640
Why didn't she tell you in person?

46:23.440 --> 46:25.640
Was she afraid you might react violently?

46:39.520 --> 46:41.840
Still thinking about the blackmail idea?

46:44.240 --> 46:45.160
I'm not sure.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.320
What are you thinking?
