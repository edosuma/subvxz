WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.602
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
I just want a huge wedding.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.005
I never dreamed
I'd marry a babe like you. I...

00:06.007 --> 00:07.706
It's the greatest
accomplishment of my life.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.475
I just...
I want everyone to know it.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.176
I am running
for the 16th District Alderman

00:11.178 --> 00:12.544
of West Altadenia

00:12.546 --> 00:14.146
in the local,
upcoming election.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.016
SYLVESTER:
<i> In layman's terms,</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:18.684
he's running
out of oxygen and he's loopy.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.152
TOBY: And the only person
he'll talk to is you,

00:20.154 --> 00:22.654
'cause he thinks that
you're up there with him.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.390
What? Wh-What is he saying?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.025
Things.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.226
Oh, boy.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.161
So talk to him
and get him to pull

00:29.163 --> 00:31.230
that big blue lever
that opens the exterior hatch.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.331
What if I can't do it?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.499
Then he dies.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.068
WALTER:
<i> The route is precisely timed.</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:37.703
Toby and Happy's
bachelor/bachelorette party

00:37.705 --> 00:39.071
will hit all of the highlights.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.672
So, what are the hot spots?

00:40.674 --> 00:42.107
Well, first, the science center,

00:42.109 --> 00:44.076
followed by the planetarium,

00:44.078 --> 00:45.778
a quick visit

00:45.780 --> 00:48.380
to the Natural History Museum,

00:48.382 --> 00:52.084
before ending the day
at Salton Sea.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.452
You know the Salton Sea's
effectively

00:53.454 --> 00:55.687
an abandoned resort town
because the lake's polluted?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.356
And its resulting salinity
has made the area

00:57.358 --> 00:59.458
the crown jewel
of avian biodiversity.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.628
Sly requested that we include it
in the festivities.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.180
Okay, I was
afraid of this,

01:04.181 --> 01:05.731
so I went traditional bachelor
party on my end,

01:05.733 --> 01:07.232
starting with the transportation

01:07.234 --> 01:08.734
that I have
Cabe and Sly picking up,

01:08.736 --> 01:10.169
not to mention the piñatas.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.770
Piñatas?
Yeah. It's custom-made

01:11.772 --> 01:13.622
to look like Happy and Toby.

01:13.623 --> 01:15.473
You fill them with candy,
a few mini-booze bottles,

01:15.476 --> 01:17.342
and they get to whack
the heck out of each other.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.444
It's fun.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.546
It's not as fun
as the science center.

01:20.548 --> 01:24.483
You only say that because you
haven't seen the bus I rented.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.492
This is what Paige got?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.160
How'd your first meeting go?

01:35.162 --> 01:37.696
I prepped all night for
my first constituent breakfast.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.398
Turns out,
all anybody wanted to do

01:39.400 --> 01:40.866
was complain
about red light cameras

01:40.868 --> 01:43.302
and pooper-scooping enforcement.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.637
No one wants
to step in poop, kid.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.706
After you, Mr. Alderman.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.843
Wow.

01:50.845 --> 01:53.512
This is fancy.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.581
(grunts)
Ooh.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.220
This smells sticky.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.122
Do you mind if I take a nap?

02:03.124 --> 02:04.289
I'm pretty exhausted.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.507
Good luck
with that.

02:05.508 --> 02:06.724
(engine starts,
dance music starts playing)

02:06.727 --> 02:08.293
Son a of butter churn!

02:08.295 --> 02:10.229
Turn it off!

02:10.231 --> 02:12.397
Can't. It's somehow connected
to the ignition.

02:12.399 --> 02:13.699
It's part of the party
hearty experience,

02:13.701 --> 02:15.400
I guess.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.802
I'm sure Happy can fix it.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.737
We got to swing
by her apartment

02:18.739 --> 02:21.773
and help Toby move
a few boxes into her place.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.142
Well, drive fast!

02:24.578 --> 02:27.312
I'm just saying, I thought
we agreed on a few boxes.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.848
Not a truck full of junk.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.750
These are keepsakes
from a life well-lived.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.752
More like packrat trash
from the life of a hobo.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.754
I mean,
there's a hundred binders here.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.523
Yeah. It's my
research, my papers.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.491
One day Harvard's gonna want
that stuff for their library.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.926
It's worthless
if it's not complete.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.694
Could've stopped at "worthless."

02:44.765 --> 02:46.231
I mean, what the hell is this?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.834
That's Toby Dick.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.802
See? The fedora? Huh?

02:50.804 --> 02:53.405
It's from one of my patients
with a Melville fetish.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.673
It can go over the fireplace.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.774
It can go in the fireplace.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.609
I don't want to junk up
my apartment.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.879
It is no longer your apartment.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.748
It is our home.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.249
We have the extra bedroom.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.068
My motorcycle room?

03:06.069 --> 03:07.886
I am not losing my bikes
to your yard sale.
(phone ringing)

03:07.888 --> 03:09.655
We're gonna finish
this conversation later.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.923
We're busy fighting.
What's up?

03:10.925 --> 03:12.291
WALTER:
We got a case.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.393
Really cool stuff.
You and Happy almost done?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.527
Yeah. Just a few more boxes.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.695
Okay.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.430
Patching in Sly and Cabe.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.698
SYLVESTER:
Walter, we're here.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.799
What's the case?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.768
Mars biosphere out past Solvang.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.203
Quick engineering job.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.871
We can cover it.
You and Cabe go

03:25.873 --> 03:27.790
get Paige's piñatas,
then meet us out there,

03:27.791 --> 03:29.708
so we can start Toby and Happy's
party once we're done.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.776
Sounds good.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.211
We'll catch up with you
in a bit.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.345
TOBY:
Speaking of catching up,

03:33.347 --> 03:34.947
didn't you two promise
to help me move?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.615
CABE:
Yeah, keep your pants on,

03:36.617 --> 03:38.450
we're turning onto...
Oh, that's a lot of boxes.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.785
I don't want to
move all that stuff.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.821
...into traffic, real
bad traffic right now.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.889
We're not gonna be
able to make it.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.557
(dance music playing)

03:45.559 --> 03:47.559
Hey, I see you suckers!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.328
What? Bad connection.
(imitates static)

03:52.266 --> 03:54.333
(laughs)
Smooth.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.836
NARRATOR:
Welcome to Mars.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.873
Kapper Aerospace Industries'
Mars Simulation Biodome,

04:01.875 --> 04:03.875
a state-of-the-art facility

04:03.877 --> 04:06.712
perfectly replicating
the environment and experience

04:06.714 --> 04:08.680
our first intergalactic settlers
will encounter

04:08.682 --> 04:10.349
on the Red Planet.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.551
Though built with tear-
and break-proof carbon fiber

04:12.553 --> 04:15.454
to withstand
Mars' worst windstorms,

04:15.455 --> 04:18.356
it also houses luxurious living
quarters, research-ready labs,

04:18.359 --> 04:19.825
and a virtual Garden of Eden

04:19.827 --> 04:21.727
capable of growing
a variety of foods.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.830
The MSB is the premier
Earth-replication habitat

04:24.832 --> 04:26.265
for NASA.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.067
Very impressive.

04:29.068 --> 04:30.701
Thank you. We are currently
in the final phase

04:30.704 --> 04:32.671
of our 12-month experiment.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.274
Salvatore Roselli, chemist,

04:35.276 --> 04:37.576
and Jennifer Henning,
an accomplished botanist,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.845
are just 30 days away
from completing their mission.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.680
11 months ago,

04:41.682 --> 04:43.749
they entered
the biodome to make history.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.686
(quietly): Hey. Check out
Sal's hand on Jen's back.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.920
If it's up here,
it's all business,

04:48.922 --> 04:51.390
but down here is all pleasure.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.958
If that's Eden,
Adam and Eve have been getting

04:52.960 --> 04:55.027
a little biblical
over the last 11 months.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.695
KAPPER: Once they've
completed their mission,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.364
each one will be rewarded
a $100,000 cash bonus,

04:59.366 --> 05:01.934
and Kapper Industries

05:01.935 --> 05:04.503
will be awarded a multibillion-
dollar contract from NASA

05:04.505 --> 05:06.905
to build the first biodome
on Mars.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.841
But not if we don't fix
your thorium power grid.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.942
Exactly.
It went out this morning.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.377
We are on the goal line.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.846
We cannot let
this experiment fail.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.081
Based on your schematics,
it should take a few hours

05:16.083 --> 05:17.316
to repair your grid, tops.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.583
PAIGE:
I'm confused.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.718
Won't Scorpion's involvement
compromise

05:19.720 --> 05:20.852
the integrity of the experiment?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.204
HAPPY:
Not really.

05:22.205 --> 05:23.555
Any NASA mission
would include an engineer

05:23.557 --> 05:26.425
to deal with any power issues
that might come up.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.327
But the bigger concern
is interaction

05:28.329 --> 05:29.494
with Salvatore and Jennifer.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.779
In reality,

05:30.780 --> 05:32.063
the first Mars pioneers
will be cut off

05:32.066 --> 05:33.765
from other humans
for the rest of their lives,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.751
so if your
scientific method

05:35.752 --> 05:37.736
is to remain pure, we need
to avoid them at all costs.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.405
Won't be a problem.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.073
According to schedules,
my scientists are supposed to be

05:41.075 --> 05:43.542
in the lab all day
working on an experiment,

05:43.544 --> 05:45.344
and the grid
is nowhere near them.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.979
Now, before you go, I'm gonna
need all your cell phones

05:47.981 --> 05:50.515
and comms,
for integrity of the experiment.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.650
Oh, I'm also gonna
need you all to sign

05:51.652 --> 05:53.452
standard nondisclosure
agreements.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.920
I can't let anyone know
the details of my work

05:54.922 --> 05:56.621
until I report my findings
to NASA.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.457
Of course.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.525
Since you mentioned comms,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.627
communications between Earth
and Mars would be delayed

06:02.629 --> 06:03.795
due to distance.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.930
Does your experiment
account for that?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.765
Indeed it does.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.067
Our system is programmed
to have a 20-minute lag,

06:09.069 --> 06:11.737
so everything you see or hear
from the biodome

06:11.739 --> 06:13.972
actually happened
1,200 seconds ago.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.575
You are certainly
a smart fellow.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.677
Smartest one in the room.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.612
He lives for this kind of thing.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.013
Of course. Well, school
is officially in session.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.048
Uh, here you go.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.517
Key fob for entry.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.085
And when you're done,
I'll remotely open the door

06:27.087 --> 06:29.454
so you can exit.
You lock the scientists in?

06:29.456 --> 06:31.273
They can always
request to leave.

06:31.274 --> 06:33.091
But the 20-minute delay,
it allows for reflection

06:33.093 --> 06:35.277
and avoids any rash decisions

06:35.278 --> 06:37.462
that could ruin
a multimillion-dollar venture.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.798
Now, I've got a van that's
gonna take you all to the dome

06:39.800 --> 06:41.478
in the Camino Desert.
It's about 40 minutes

06:41.479 --> 06:43.157
from mission control,
which is where I'm heading.

06:43.158 --> 06:44.836
You don't have to drive all
the way over there, Mr. Kapper.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.104
I can get into your system

06:46.106 --> 06:47.839
and we can observe from here.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.341
Oh, that certainly
is a fun idea, son,

06:49.342 --> 06:50.842
but we've got a state-of-the-art
security system...

06:50.844 --> 06:52.177
See? Here it is.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.512
Wait, what?

06:54.948 --> 06:55.914
How did he do...

06:55.916 --> 06:56.982
Smartest one in the room.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.684
(phone ringing)

06:59.686 --> 07:01.019
Hello.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.888
Paige, we can't turn
the music off in this thing!

07:02.890 --> 07:04.823
I didn't know that when I rented
it; just check the manual.

07:04.825 --> 07:05.891
I did.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.058
It's useless.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.460
I am sure you can figure it out.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.561
How's the party planning going?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.729
Uh, it's good.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.931
We're on our way
to pick up your piñatas now.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.033
Paige. What was the
deposit on this thing?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.903
$500. Why?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.604
'Cause I'm pulling over
and tearing out these speakers.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.573
What? No...

07:21.575 --> 07:22.908
Cabe.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.075
(beeps)

07:24.077 --> 07:25.844
I'm not paying
for those speakers.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.920
TOBY:
Okay, and the truth comes out.

07:34.922 --> 07:38.123
No wonder we signed
nondisclosure agreements.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.662
(Walter sniffing)

07:43.664 --> 07:45.130
You smell something?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.866
That's the, uh, putrid
stench of failure.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.835
HAPPY:
What a dump.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.470
You can keep your stuff<i> here.</i>

07:55.676 --> 07:57.042
No, it's the smell
of the ultraviolet lights

07:57.044 --> 07:58.477
from the garden

07:58.479 --> 08:01.880
hitting the oxygen-ozone
mixture, it's like...

08:06.119 --> 08:07.953
Oh, hello.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.955
Let me help you out.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.190
Hello, Walter.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.861
I've smelled this before.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.062
Walt, you all right, pal?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.597
You're looking a little loopy.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.099
Yeah, I, uh...

08:21.101 --> 08:23.118
(exhales)

08:23.119 --> 08:25.136
The smell in here just caused
the strangest memory,

08:25.138 --> 08:27.539
but there's no way
this could be a memory.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.975
What was it?
Uh, this is gonna sound crazy,

08:29.977 --> 08:34.546
but Paige and I were
on Elia's space capsule.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.116
You know, uh,
as a psychiatrist,

08:38.118 --> 08:39.784
I can tell you

08:39.786 --> 08:42.053
that that did not happen
and, yes, it does sound crazy.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.623
So, uh, how about
we focus on the grid

08:44.625 --> 08:47.659
and get out
of this pigsty?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.230
What the hell's going
on with Walt?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.132
He's having
an olfactory-triggered memory.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.835
That rocket had
an O2-ozone mixture,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.136
and it was hit
with ultraviolet rays

08:58.138 --> 08:59.204
from the sun.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.805
The stink
in here is similar.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.040
It's taking him
back to when he thought

09:02.042 --> 09:03.308
he was star-hopping with Paige.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.744
He said a lot of things
to Paige up there.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.945
Best these memories stay buried.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.046
Agreed.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.814
So how about
we just fix the grid

09:09.816 --> 09:12.150
and then get out of here
before his schnoz sniffs out

09:12.152 --> 09:14.152
any more of the truth.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.621
This place looked
a lot better in the video.

09:16.623 --> 09:19.891
These are tell-tale signs
of full-blown ego depletion.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.192
These biodome
inhabitants,

09:21.194 --> 09:22.160
they must've been so driven

09:22.162 --> 09:24.229
to succeed in their experiments,

09:24.231 --> 09:27.699
they weren't able to focus
on any of the other elements

09:27.701 --> 09:29.634
of life satisfaction.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.002
Like hygiene.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.238
Don't blame me.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.674
I'm a neat freak.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.042
Salvatore Roselli, I presume.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.681
Who the hell are you guys?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.282
That bastard Kapper send you?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.151
Yeah, and he said
that you and your partner

09:46.153 --> 09:47.352
would be in the lab.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.220
Oh, please.
He knows we haven't followed

09:49.222 --> 09:50.922
our work schedule for months.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.725
All he cares about is keeping
this place barely running

09:53.727 --> 09:55.694
for the next month
to impress NASA.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.195
You pick up on Kapper lying?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.663
He said that,
according to schedule,

09:58.664 --> 10:00.130
they should be in the lab,
and they<i> should</i> be.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.133
That's not a lie.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.134
He didn't seem like a fraud,
he was very congenial.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.738
Oh, yeah?
Well, he didn't lock you up

10:06.740 --> 10:09.040
in a snow globe
with faulty equipment

10:09.042 --> 10:10.075
and a blonde lunatic.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.710
JENNIFER:
Real nice.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.878
Only people we've seen
in over 330 days,

10:13.880 --> 10:15.880
and first thing you
do is badmouth me.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.683
And you must be
Jennifer Hennings.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.852
Uh, no, she goes
by Oscar the Grouch now.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.253
Really? The messy thing?
With visitors?

10:22.255 --> 10:23.755
I am a man of science.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.191
I observe and draw conclusions.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.060
And after observing you
for the past 11 months,

10:29.062 --> 10:31.696
my conclusion is, you're a slob.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.031
TOBY:
Okay, friends.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.699
We don't really want to get
in the middle of things.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.334
In fact,
this interplay

10:36.336 --> 10:37.786
taints the whole experiment.

10:37.787 --> 10:39.237
This thing's been tainted
since the day we came in.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.374
Yeah, mostly because
the world-class botanist

10:42.376 --> 10:43.892
can't sustain a farm.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.409
None of my plants would've died
if I would've been given

10:45.412 --> 10:48.246
the proper fertilizer mixtures
from Mr. Ivy League Chemist.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.148
Ivy League. Harvard?
Dartmouth.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.250
No wonder this failed.
WALTER:
Sal, Jen,

10:52.252 --> 10:54.019
we're just here to
fix the power grid,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.087
so if you could just
show us where that is,

10:56.089 --> 10:59.157
we will do our thing and
get out of your... hair.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.392
HAPPY:
Your wild,

11:00.394 --> 11:02.260
unkempt, crazy hair.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.395
SAL:
It's about time
Kapper sent somebody.

11:03.397 --> 11:06.064
Power's been
very unreliable lately.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.232
Totally inconsistent.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.366
Look at that.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.035
Something that
you agree on.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.237
So how about we get
the electricity humming

11:12.239 --> 11:15.040
and you guys can hot-plate
up some vittles,

11:15.042 --> 11:18.243
'cause you-you both look thinner
than when you came in here,

11:18.245 --> 11:19.344
and Jen, you're, um,

11:19.346 --> 11:20.412
you're a
little jaundiced,

11:20.414 --> 11:22.881
and your skin is
showing low turgor.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.716
I'm a little concerned
about your health.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.984
Yeah, I lost some weight.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.253
But I'm rationing

11:28.255 --> 11:29.888
my space-mush supplies.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.256
I'll make it the last month.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.425
And I'm growing fruits
and vegetables in my room.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.460
Barely.
And she doesn't share them.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.162
Okay, I'll tell you what,

11:37.164 --> 11:39.781
how about you show me
this lovely garden,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.399
and, uh, Sal, why don't you
show Walter and Happy the grid?

11:42.402 --> 11:43.885
We'll get it fixed

11:43.886 --> 11:45.369
and then we'll get
out of this madhouse.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.438
Follow me.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.743
JENNIFER:
Once the farm started dying,

11:51.745 --> 11:53.945
I moved viable plants in here.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.380
Put out my own soil bin.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.748
Let me turn on the lights
and the hydroponics

11:56.750 --> 11:57.749
so you can get
the full experience.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.184
(switch clicks)

11:59.186 --> 12:01.186
Isn't it beautiful?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.253
Oh, yeah.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.389
It's certainly interesting.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.358
That's a lot of dirt up there.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.860
Sal says I'm hoarding
all the power,

12:08.862 --> 12:10.361
but I need it.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.930
So screw him.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.166
It's funny, from the video
that Kapper showed us,

12:15.168 --> 12:16.935
I assumed you were a couple.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.369
Yeah, we were.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.938
And then we came in here.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.240
You know, when you work
with someone all day

12:22.242 --> 12:25.043
and live with them all night,
there's no space to yourself.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.377
Not healthy.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.413
You don't say.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.217
Here she is,
the thorium reactor.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.119
Who jerry-rigged that?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.286
She takes all the energy

12:35.288 --> 12:36.921
for her
precious plants,

12:36.923 --> 12:38.490
but I set up a back door
so things could be

12:38.492 --> 12:40.258
a bit more equitable.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.460
So she's siphoning off power and
you're trying to siphon it back.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.428
SAL:
As of this morning,

12:43.429 --> 12:44.395
when I finished
splicing the wires

12:44.397 --> 12:46.765
to redirect the lines.

12:46.767 --> 12:50.034
This thing is not designed
for multiple line outputs.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.402
It's why your grid
went down today.
(buzzing)

12:51.404 --> 12:53.772
Oh, are you kidding?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.407
This is rigged for disaster.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.176
SAL: I guarantee you
Jen turned on her pod's

12:58.178 --> 13:00.162
light show for Mr. Harvard.

13:00.163 --> 13:02.147
(electricity crackling)
HAPPY: Oh, this is bad.
The system's overheating.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.415
Can you fix it?
No way I can sort through
this in time.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.218
Come on, it's gonna blow.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.554
And this is my prized zucchini.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.823
SAL (through vent):
Jen, turn off your power now!

13:11.825 --> 13:13.892
See, he's always
complaining about the power.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.126
He just won't shut up!

13:22.536 --> 13:24.803
(Sal coughing)

13:27.140 --> 13:28.406
Sal, you okay?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.407
Yeah.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.542
HAPPY:
Walt,

13:30.544 --> 13:31.543
you all right?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.548
♪ ♪

13:42.489 --> 13:43.888
HAPPY:
Walt?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.390
You still with me?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.059
Uh, y-yeah, think so.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.428
Listen, the reactor exploded.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.896
You sure you're okay?

13:51.897 --> 13:53.363
Yeah, yeah, we should
check on the others.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.534
But first I need you
to tell me something.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.270
What happened to me
when I was up in that rocket?

14:13.386 --> 14:16.354
I recall the strangest things
about my time in space.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.922
You can't recall things
that never happened.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.257
SAL:
What the hell happened here?

14:19.259 --> 14:20.892
Toby, you in there?

14:20.894 --> 14:21.893
TOBY:
Yeah, yeah.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.261
We're here.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.432
Guys, that loft gave way
and there's a mountain of soil

14:27.434 --> 14:29.167
blocking the door.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.336
Oh, God.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.604
We're sealed in.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.172
It's getting really hot in here.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.107
WALTER:
Out here, too.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.041
Reactor-grade thorium gives off
a massive amount of heat.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.178
And we're in a dome
constructed of carbon fiber.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.613
We're basically
in an oven.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.047
We are not dealing with
a lot of square footage.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.048
Things will get
exponentially hotter

14:44.050 --> 14:46.217
in a very brief period of time.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.052
TOBY: Yeah, especially in here.
It's a much smaller space.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.154
We must've jumped 20 degrees
in the last two minutes.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.122
We need shovels.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.490
We've got some
at the farm.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.259
Come on.
Okay.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.230
Uh...

14:59.232 --> 15:01.299
Walt, Jen was in bad
shape to begin with.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.334
Dehydration and malnutrition.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.503
She's swooning
now and...

15:05.505 --> 15:07.205
Walt, the AC unit's out.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.607
RALPH: Okay, I'm into
your security cameras.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.309
Hey, how about you fix
all the vulnerabilities

15:11.311 --> 15:13.278
you're exploiting
to hack into my biodome?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.313
Got to protect the jewel
of Kapper Industries.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.150
Oh, look, there's
the team going in.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.352
Not really,
that was 20 minutes ago.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.620
They're probably
hard at work now.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.122
The jewel
of Kapper Industries seems

15:24.124 --> 15:26.190
to have lost some of its luster.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.258
Yeah, what happened to Eden?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.993
Look, I'm the
first to admit

15:28.995 --> 15:30.628
that the dome looks
a little bit lived in,

15:30.630 --> 15:32.964
but that's a small price
to pay to make history.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.567
Fine, I ran into funding issues
halfway through the project.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.236
So the dome isn't
all I hoped for,

15:38.238 --> 15:41.172
but it's still a beacon
for scientific inquiry.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.341
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with my team

15:43.343 --> 15:45.243
repairing a sensitive
reactor in a place

15:45.245 --> 15:46.645
that looks like an attraction

15:46.646 --> 15:48.046
from an abandoned
amusement park.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.248
I assure you, there is
nothing to worry about.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.151
They're in a very secure,
very safe environment.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.070
Guys, I'm getting nowhere here.

15:55.071 --> 15:56.988
This dirt
just keeps backfilling.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.356
Dr. Curtis...

15:59.192 --> 16:00.158
I'm feeling dizzy.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.159
HAPPY:
Hold on!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.694
We're going as fast as we can.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.531
Hey, I know you're hotter
than a street-corner Rolex,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.166
but you just got
to stay with me.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.969
Guys, guys,
she's in bad shape.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.170
We don't have much time.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.338
In this heat we could lose her.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.307
This is taking too long.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.108
She never should've brought this
dirt into the living quarters.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.178
But she had to have her
ammonium nitrate-rich soil

16:20.180 --> 16:22.013
for her
stupid plants.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.014
Ammonium nitrate?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.349
Stop digging, stop digging.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.017
Do you have pure
ammonium nitrate in the lab?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.185
Yeah.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.352
We can use it to
freeze the soil.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.871
Once it's frozen,
we can break it up

16:29.872 --> 16:31.388
into movable blocks
and get them out in minutes.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.191
I'll be right back.
Okay, Toby?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.360
You need to find a way to
soak the soil with water.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.362
This won't work unless
it's saturated.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.230
I'm on it!

16:41.368 --> 16:43.368
PAIGE: Is it my imagination,
or do those scientists

16:43.370 --> 16:44.669
not like each other very much?
(phone rings)

16:44.671 --> 16:46.037
Hey, Sylvester.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.171
SYLVESTER:
Ralph, I just got

16:47.173 --> 16:48.673
a text alert on my Emergency App

16:48.675 --> 16:51.209
about seismic activity
at the same coordinates

16:51.211 --> 16:52.310
as the biodome.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.079
It's only a 2.7
on the Richter scale,

16:55.081 --> 16:57.281
but still I thought it prudent
to call and check it out.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.317
RALPH: I'm pulling up the U.S.
Geological Survey site now.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.869
What's up?
Probably nothing.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.420
Might've been a small tremor
at the biodome.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.155
Could slow down
the guys' work.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.190
No, the dome, it's built
to withstand the impact

17:06.192 --> 17:08.276
of even a strong shaker.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.361
That place couldn't withstand
the impact of a salt shaker.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.263
RALPH:
Mom, this is bad.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.297
There's no record
of fault line movement

17:13.299 --> 17:14.799
within a 100-mile radius
of here.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.601
Okay, why's that bad?

17:16.602 --> 17:18.402
It means the tremor
the government sensors picked up

17:18.405 --> 17:19.604
was man-made.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.372
Something inside
the biodome released

17:21.374 --> 17:23.241
as much energy
as a small earthquake.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.376
Oh, thorium reactor.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.547
What's he doing?
Turning off the 20-minute
delay so we can see

17:29.549 --> 17:31.616
what's happening to
the team in real time.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.556
What happened to the very safe

17:38.558 --> 17:40.792
and secure environment
you promised?

17:47.767 --> 17:51.803
Get the ammonium nitrate as
deep into the soil as you can.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.638
What exactly is
the plan here?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.840
WALTER: Toby's saturating
the soil with water.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.708
When ammonium nitrate
comes into contact

17:57.710 --> 17:59.043
with dihydrogen
monoxide...

17:59.044 --> 18:00.377
You mean when dirt
touches the water?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.413
Yeah.
Freezes the surrounding soil.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.082
HAPPY: And then we can
break it up into pieces

18:04.084 --> 18:06.717
and remove it like
a collapsed brick wall.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.586
(grunting and panting)

18:08.588 --> 18:09.787
Just hang in there.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.456

we'll be out of here soon.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.530
(dirt rustling)

18:21.434 --> 18:22.266
It's working.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.669
It's freezing solid.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.837
Just hold on, Jen.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.605
We'll be
there soon.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.740
(grunts)

18:29.742 --> 18:31.476
The largest solidifications
will be in the center.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.515
Here, let me get it.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.156

18:49.329 --> 18:51.462
Ralph, stop the

19:03.877 --> 19:06.344
RALPH: Mom, I just pulled up
the biodome's diagnostics.

It's 110 degrees in there
and increasing.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.347
Okay, we have to manually
get them out.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.681
The nearest people

19:18.524 --> 19:19.523
Where the hell are you going?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.860
Hey, you all signed
nondisclosure agreements.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.529
I wish you the
best of luck,

getting a little hairy,

19:30.370 --> 19:31.836
What a jerk.

You okay?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.372
Tired.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.507
I don't feel good.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.442
Okay, just catch your breath.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.546
If only someone had warned you
about putting the soil supply

20:33.399 --> 20:34.465
It's Paige. Can you hear me?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.967
Loud and clear.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.468
Status report:
Ralph rigged the P.A. system.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.569
Sly and Cabe are linked in.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.570
We know about the explosion.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.938
Door's broken, can't get out.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.939
Kapper just ran off,
you're screwed.

20:41.941 --> 20:42.940
TOBY:
No, no, no, no, no.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.575
We got to get out of here stat.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.943
It's humid as hell,
and in moist air,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.412
heat levels of
122 degrees

20:48.414 --> 20:49.747
are acutely fatal because
the water vapor

20:49.749 --> 20:50.881
condenses in your lungs.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.284
We got to be at 110 right now.
112.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.319
Ah! Less than a half an hour
until we're dead.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.071
We got to buy
some time

20:57.072 --> 20:58.822
until we figure out a way
to get out of this Crock-Pot.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.791
Jen's air-conditioning unit.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.993
We can use its
refrigerant

21:01.995 --> 21:03.261
to temporarily cool the thorium

21:03.263 --> 21:04.362
in what's left of the reactor.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.914
It'll eventually heat up again,

21:05.915 --> 21:07.465
but at least we'll slow down
our slow-roasting.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.432
Yeah.

Got it.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.830
Let's go, let's go.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.984
When the coolant
hits the thorium,

21:42.985 --> 21:44.602
it's gonna cause
an incredibly hot steam cloud.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.004
What about you?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.405
There's gonna be
a concussive pulse.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.706

22:08.628 --> 22:10.328
You should've kissed her
on the mouth.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.729
It's not funny.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.531

22:17.637 --> 22:20.071
Um... kissing you in space?

22:20.073 --> 22:22.340
I-I know that didn't happen.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.108
Then what am I remembering?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.943
M-Maybe you had a sexy dream.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.578

<i> by what I can only assume</i>

22:52.405 --> 22:54.405
is the waste tank.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.406
The waste tank? That must've
ruptured during the explosion.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.109
This is bad.

waste tank good?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.812
Spell it out, Doc.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.748
Ammonia is a natural
by-product of human waste,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.916
but it should be treated
with certain chemicals

23:05.918 --> 23:07.485
to prevent dangerous
bacteria from forming,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.287
and, you know,

23:09.288 --> 23:11.088
judging from the looks
of this crap-shack,

23:11.090 --> 23:12.556
I don't think Kapper
was big on upkeep.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.091
What's so dangerous
about this waste fog?

23:14.093 --> 23:16.727
When concentrations of ammonia
mix with humid air,

23:16.729 --> 23:18.996
it creates a cloud
that's deadly if inhaled.

No, we won't have to wait for
the fog to come down to us.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.974
Once it makes its way through
the ducts to these wall vents,

24:03.976 --> 24:06.010
it'll fill this room up
in seconds.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.011
Sly, we'll handle
the vents in here.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.145

24:08.147 --> 24:09.146
<i> to seal the waste tank.</i>

25:32.832 --> 25:34.015
Done.

25:34.016 --> 25:35.199
Now the only one left
is up there.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.168
Yeah, y-you might not have
the vertical leap.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.670
I can climb up
the scaffolding.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.572
HAPPY:
That's not a scaffold.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.073
It's aluminum framing
for the sprinkler system.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.675
Wasn't built for climbing.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.010
And those piñatas weren't
made to be snorkels.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.044
We're in improvisation mode.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.145
So, I'll need goggles,

25:48.147 --> 25:49.647
respirator mask,

25:49.648 --> 25:51.148
and rope to descend down
after I seal the vent.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.783
In the lab, all you need.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.251
Toby, Happy, go grab
those items for me.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.086
And, Sal,

25:56.088 --> 25:58.188
help me combine all our soil
into one bucket.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.159
Be careful. The melting
point of aluminum

26:02.161 --> 26:04.795
is 1,221 degrees,

26:04.797 --> 26:07.965
but the melting point of your
hand is a whole lot less.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.869
SAL: That is not
a high-end respirator.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.605
It only blocks minor fumes
from chemical experiments.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.074
The filter will fail
in a minute or two.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.576
Good to know.

26:18.578 --> 26:22.246
All right. Here I go.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.252
Hope that mask
protects him.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.154
JENNIFER:
No way of knowing.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.623
It's not like Sal's lab
equipment was ever used.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.626
I can't believe I had
two tons of dirt and a shovel

26:35.628 --> 26:37.127
and you're still here.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.128
TOBY:
Don't worry.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.129
They're not us.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.664
We are not them. Right?

26:40.666 --> 26:42.099
Not yet, anyway.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.237
I made it.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.848
(coughing)

26:59.118 --> 27:00.284
(groans)

27:04.824 --> 27:08.959
Okay. Head back to the bus.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.095
SYLVESTER:
Guys, the tank is sealed.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.764
Out here, the fog should
dissipate in a few minutes.

27:13.766 --> 27:17.001
That means the only place
the fog being generated

27:17.003 --> 27:18.736
inside the tank can go

27:18.738 --> 27:20.304
is through the vent in the dome.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.106
It should start
pouring out faster.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.807
It's starting to.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.409
PAIGE:
That looks really bad,

27:25.411 --> 27:26.977
and you don't have a good mask.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.879
Hurry up or you won't
be getting enough oxygen.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.249
Because you're not getting
enough oxygen.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.817
WALTER:
I know I can't be what you need.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.220
I know I can't be
emotionally present

27:36.222 --> 27:38.940
the way that you deserve,

27:38.941 --> 27:41.659
but I always thought
that, that eventually,

27:41.661 --> 27:44.161
that you'd want to...
you'd want to be with me.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.996
That's why it hurts...

27:45.998 --> 27:48.198
because I love you.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.701
I love you, too, Walter.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.203
What? What did she say?
(screams)

27:53.205 --> 27:55.673
TOBY:
Walt, just hold on.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.207
We're gonna figure out a way
to get you down.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.843
WALTER:
You guys lied to me!

27:59.845 --> 28:01.845
I know what happened!

28:01.847 --> 28:04.381
Paige told me
she loves me in space!

28:05.851 --> 28:07.217
Oh, man.
Oh, no.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.353
Oh, boy.
Oh, crap.

28:15.094 --> 28:18.328
Hey, Walt, uh, look, it's not
<i> Princess and the Pea</i> quality,

28:18.330 --> 28:20.731
but it should stop you from
breaking most of your bones.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.865
WALTER:
I don't care about that.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.701
I just want to know from Paige,

28:23.703 --> 28:25.069
why did you tell me
you loved me?

28:25.071 --> 28:26.804
Mom.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.472
Did you really say
that to Walter?

28:28.474 --> 28:30.941
Um... honey, I don't recall.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.009
WALTER:
Yes, you do.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.077
I can hear it in your voice.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.045
Uh...

28:35.047 --> 28:36.413
I'm getting dizzy.

28:36.414 --> 28:37.780
I found a knife!
(stammers)
Point down!

28:37.783 --> 28:39.116
Okay.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.218
I'm coming up, drop the gear.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.993
TOBY: Listen,
Walt's a bit below the fog,

28:49.995 --> 28:52.329
but you're gonna be right
up in it, so spackle fast,

28:52.331 --> 28:53.731
cut him loose and get down.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.300
Okay?

28:59.939 --> 29:01.105
PAIGE:
Careful, Happy.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.573
That place is held together

29:02.574 --> 29:04.040
by spit and chewing gum.
It looks sturdy,

29:04.043 --> 29:06.176
but it's deceptive.
Oh, like you?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.045
I wasn't being deceptive.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.247
I said what I had to say
to get you back to Earth safely.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.083
Ah! So you admit it.
You said it.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.819
Son, stop acting
like a hurt schoolboy.

29:15.821 --> 29:16.954
Focus on getting down

29:16.956 --> 29:18.021
and get out of there.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.089
And he better do that fast.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.257
Even after Happy
covers the vent,

29:20.259 --> 29:22.092
the dome's at 120 degrees now.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.194
Two more degrees
and respiratory failure.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.231
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:27.233 --> 29:30.134
Keep your eyes open, Jen.
Come on.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.305
Sly, Cabe, we only got
a few minutes.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.539
You got to find a way
to get the door open.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.540
SYLVESTER:
Is that all?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.542
It's a reinforced, triple steel,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.778
mechanically and
electronically locked

29:40.780 --> 29:42.296
biodome door.

29:42.297 --> 29:43.813
We need tools and time.
All we have is a few minutes

29:43.816 --> 29:45.149
and a party bus.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.417
That's right. So, let's party.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.786
Champagne?

29:48.788 --> 29:50.053
You're damn right.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.990
Let's suck the fuel
out of this bus

29:52.992 --> 29:54.324
and make some Molotov cocktails.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.126
I'm never getting
that deposit back.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.495
Okay, vent is sealed.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.464
Time for Operation Chumbo Drop.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.167
'Cause you're my chum. Get it?

30:03.169 --> 30:04.935
Eh, it's amusing.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.104
Hey, hey, you might want
to step to the side.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.539
Forecast calls for genius.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.479
(screams)

30:15.481 --> 30:16.480
(grunts)

30:16.482 --> 30:18.315
(groans)

30:18.317 --> 30:19.583
Are you okay, pal?

30:19.585 --> 30:20.918
Yeah, you know,

30:20.920 --> 30:23.053
if we're gonna
effectively dry-drown

30:23.055 --> 30:24.855
in our own lung fluid,
I have to demand

30:24.857 --> 30:26.256
that you tell me
what happened on that rocket.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.158
You won't like it.
Try me.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.994
Oh, help.
Help, she's unconscious.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.998
Guys, her pulse
is extremely weak.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Uh, she looks worse than I feel.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.202
Will she even make it till Cabe

30:38.204 --> 30:39.036
figures a way
to open the door?

30:39.038 --> 30:40.454
No, not at this rate.

30:40.455 --> 30:41.871
We got to get fluids
into her directly.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.540
There is no time
for consumption or absorption.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.175
So, grab your medical bag.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.245
Um, I'm looking right at it.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.214
How does it help us
in the garage?

30:50.216 --> 30:51.248
We came to fix a reactor.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.883
Why would I bring
my medical bag?!

30:52.885 --> 30:54.585
The irrigation system.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.360
Sal, I saw salt and
water in Jen's room.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.394
Hurry up and get it.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.096
What are you thinking, Walt?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.165
She is dead in less than
a minute unless I can figure out

31:08.167 --> 31:11.134
a way to inject her
without a needle.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.236
Oh, just what I thought.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.203
It's driven by a piston.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.605
Uh, engineer,

31:14.607 --> 31:17.641
how do I build
an injector from this?

31:17.643 --> 31:20.143
Uh, I'm a little foggy.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.312
We all are, but you can do this.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.314
Okay.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.151
I'm sorry about this.
Huh?

31:28.153 --> 31:30.287
Oh, my laptop!

31:31.223 --> 31:33.123
Needed the magnet.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.625
And I need
electrical current.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.159
Oh, I got it.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.495
Okay, I'm putting the
magnet under the piston.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.265
And once Toby hits it
with electricity,

31:41.267 --> 31:43.200
it creates Lorentz force,
increasing the piston's velocity

31:43.202 --> 31:44.668
so much that...
The saline solution

31:44.670 --> 31:46.536
penetrates her skin,

31:46.538 --> 31:48.105
right into the fatty tissue.

31:48.107 --> 31:51.275
Here, I got the
water-salt solution.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.116
Yeah.
Done with the injector.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.652
TOBY: All right,
put it against her skin.

32:01.654 --> 32:06.089
Jen, I want you to know
I'm sorry for everything.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.659
Please be okay.

32:08.661 --> 32:12.195
All right, here goes science.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.163
(grunts)

32:16.368 --> 32:18.302
Four heart pumps,
and hydration should hit

32:18.304 --> 32:19.369
most of her body.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.148
Hi.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.183
Sal,

32:33.185 --> 32:34.584
I'm sorry, too.

32:34.586 --> 32:35.686
PAIGE:
Guys, the temperature reads

32:35.688 --> 32:37.354
121.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.990
122, we're goners.

32:39.992 --> 32:42.392
Uh, Cabe,
what's your plan?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.661
Figured what's a bachelor
party without cocktails?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.430
We're gonna blow that
damn door off its hinges.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.108
Found aluminum oxide.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.410
Ah, calcium hydroxide.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.080
Got it.
Pour it in.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.249
I am really feeling this
in my lungs, Walt.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.251
Do you think Cabe's plan
is going to work?

33:08.253 --> 33:09.419
If we bring the explosives,

33:09.421 --> 33:12.422
he brings the heat, it'll work.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.192
(coughing)

33:15.194 --> 33:16.526
Yeah, hold on, big guy,

33:16.528 --> 33:18.161
we'll be in frigid,
85-degree weather

33:18.163 --> 33:19.997
before you know it.
I'm not gonna make it.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.265
Oh, no, no, no.
No sitting down on the job.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.202
WALTER: Everyone,
get away from the door.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.705
(grunting)

33:32.611 --> 33:37.314
Cabe, the explosion putty's
on the hinges.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.549
Steel door will transfer heat to
the putty quickly, so back away.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.159
Okay, now!
(grunts)

34:00.105 --> 34:02.039
PAIGE:
Cabe, are you there?

34:02.041 --> 34:03.407
Are they okay?

34:05.177 --> 34:06.410
(all coughing)

34:09.681 --> 34:12.049
They're banged up,
but they're all right.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.083
(coughing)

34:13.085 --> 34:14.584
Thanks, guys.

34:14.586 --> 34:18.188
SYLVESTER:
Water from the party bus.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.057
The EMTs should be
on their way soon.

34:23.128 --> 34:24.561
Is that a door hinge?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.565
I don't think Paige is gonna
get her deposit back.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.571
You okay?

34:34.573 --> 34:36.773
Physically, yes.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.242
You upset about Paige
and outer space?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.447
Everyone knew?

34:43.449 --> 34:45.649
I poured my heart out to her,
and everyone knew?

34:47.219 --> 34:50.420
So all this time, I'm walking
around the office unaware,

34:50.422 --> 34:52.622
like an imbecile, and...

34:56.862 --> 34:59.396
I'm disappointed in Paige.
She lied to me.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.198
CABE:
She didn't lie to you.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.133
You were suffering
hallucinations.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.734
She helped save you.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.138
She didn't tell you
what happened because

35:08.140 --> 35:10.240
she probably thought
you'd be embarrassed.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.843
SYLVESTER:
Which you shouldn't be.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.611
You told someone
you loved 'em, so what?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.113
You made out
with your palm--

35:16.115 --> 35:17.714
who cares?
I did what?

35:17.716 --> 35:23.120
Yeah, um, when you imagined
you were kissing Paige,

35:23.122 --> 35:26.656
you sort of sucked face
with your hand.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.534
Let's go home.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.476
(upbeat pop music playing)

35:46.478 --> 35:48.445
Thanks.

35:48.447 --> 35:51.148
Wow, pretzels, three
adults and a kid.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.283
Cops are gonna break up
this bachelor party any minute.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.618
I know, it's not
what we planned,

35:54.620 --> 35:56.853
but the bus is ruined,
the piñatas are toxic,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.455
and none of you are
in any shape

35:58.457 --> 35:59.456
to run around tonight.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.690
But I have a surprise coming,

36:00.692 --> 36:01.758
and it should be here
any minute.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.230
Any idea
when he'll be coming down?

36:07.232 --> 36:08.632
He said he had
some thinking to do.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.367
Maybe I should go talk to him.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.602
I wouldn't do that.
He's a little spaced out,

36:12.604 --> 36:14.504
on account
of what happened in space.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.274
I think he needs his space.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.508
CABE:
Okay, thank you.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.943
Well, Kapper's been hit
with over a million

36:19.945 --> 36:21.611
in environmental fines.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.346
NASA won't work with him.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.950
Man, this party sucks.
Tell me about it.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.718
I have a surprise coming.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.520
While we're on the topic
of surprises,

36:30.522 --> 36:33.356
saw Happy unloading
a wrapped gift from her truck.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.791
Can only assume
it's for you, Doc.

36:34.793 --> 36:38.662
This party just got better.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.564
Oh!

36:40.566 --> 36:42.616
Happy, let me help you
with that.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.667
Is this for the bachelor/
bachelorette party?

36:44.670 --> 36:47.571
Nope. It's more
of a housewarming.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.340
Or should I say "homewarming"?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.577
I don't want our relationship
to die like those plants

36:53.579 --> 36:55.112
in the biodome.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.646
And I surely do not want
to end up like Sal and Jennifer.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.349
Me, either. I mean,
we see each other a ton now,

36:59.351 --> 37:01.585
and once we're shacked up, it's
gonna be all Toby all the time.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.988
And... well, that's, uh...
that can be a lot to take.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.623
And you'll be getting
round-the-clock Happy.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.958
That's... no picnic.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.593
So let's remember

37:09.595 --> 37:11.261
those dome-dwellers
as a cautionary tale

37:11.263 --> 37:13.330
and make sure we don't get
on each other's nerves.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.332
Agreed. Can I open it now?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.666
It's your present, dummy.

37:21.807 --> 37:25.308
You had Toby Dick framed?

37:25.310 --> 37:28.245
My way of saying we'll make room
for your crap.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.682
Mom, can we talk?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.351
Sure, honey. What's up?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.253
(sighs) I'm confused.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.256
When Walter was hallucinating,
he didn't stop being a genius.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.258
He just saw things
that weren't there.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.460
Um, okay.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.695
Well, a genius brain knows
when it's being duped,

37:45.697 --> 37:47.397
even with hypoxia.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.266
His brain would've picked up
on it.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.368
I... I don't get your point.

37:51.370 --> 37:54.738
Have you considered
you weren't lying to Walter

37:54.740 --> 37:56.473
when you told him you loved him?

37:58.577 --> 38:01.945
Perhaps it worked because his
brain processed it as a fact.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.614
Please,

38:04.616 --> 38:07.817
just think about it.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.789
Man, this party sucks.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.457
BOTH:
She has a surprise.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.992
(door opens)

38:18.630 --> 38:19.763
What the hell is that?

38:19.765 --> 38:20.930
The surprise.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.932
Everyone meet Abra-Cadabracus,

38:22.934 --> 38:23.933
the mathemagician.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.068
Greetings.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.636
CABE:
I went to a bachelor party

38:26.638 --> 38:28.305
in Saigon once,

38:28.307 --> 38:30.340
woke up in the middle
of Ho Chi Minh Square

38:30.342 --> 38:32.909
with my underpants on my head.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.779
Man, my life's taken a turn.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.747
No, don't be like that.
Abra-Cadabracus,

38:37.749 --> 38:38.915
do your thing.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.483
Okay, folks.
Let's start by throwing out

38:40.485 --> 38:42.652
any two three-digit numbers

38:42.654 --> 38:44.321
that I will then multiply.

38:44.323 --> 38:47.023
Wow, you just brought
a knife to a gunfight.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.426
Sly, 364 x 245?

38:49.428 --> 38:51.394
89,180.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.663
Wow, that... that was fast.

38:53.665 --> 38:57.033
1,101,564 / 4,962?

38:57.035 --> 38:59.669
222.
Uncool, guys.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.904
He's all I could find
on short notice.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.772
Square root of 879?

39:02.774 --> 39:05.442
29.6479. Do we have any chips?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.677
I didn't come here to be mocked.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.747
No, I... I'm sorry.
I'll send your check.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.718
Oh, hey, Walt.
You missed Abra-Cacrapacus.

39:17.556 --> 39:18.922
Paige, a moment?

39:18.924 --> 39:21.491
Oh.

39:29.101 --> 39:32.869
So, I... I want to apologize

39:32.871 --> 39:35.038
for getting angry today.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.907
Oh. It's okay. (chuckles)

39:37.909 --> 39:41.678
You know, I understand that
you said what you had to say

39:41.680 --> 39:44.447
to save my life.
Yes, exactly.

39:44.449 --> 39:46.716
I mean, if I hadn't gotten you
to pull that hatch open,

39:46.718 --> 39:47.901
your body would be decomposing

39:47.902 --> 39:49.085
somewhere around Pluto
right now. (chuckles)

39:49.087 --> 39:50.887
Actually,
decomposition requires oxygen,

39:50.889 --> 39:52.655
and there's no oxygen in space.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.090
But never mind.
It's not relevant.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.826
I have to say, you're handling
this incredibly well.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.461
I'm impressed.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.662
Because of you.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.598
You've taught me so much

40:01.600 --> 40:03.633
over the past three years.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.635
I can deal with human beings
much better now

40:05.637 --> 40:08.738
and relate to others
thanks to you.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.673
And that's why...

40:10.675 --> 40:13.643
your services
are no longer required

40:13.645 --> 40:16.079
a-at Scorpion.

40:16.081 --> 40:20.150
Wh... I'm sorry. What?

40:20.152 --> 40:23.787
You've done your job.
Incredibly well.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.789
And it's time to move on

40:25.791 --> 40:28.725
to a new challenge,
so I spoke to Richard Elia,

40:28.727 --> 40:30.960
and he wants you to go work
for him.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.864
He-He's always
been impressed by you.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.065
Are you kidding me?

40:36.067 --> 40:39.669
N-No. I've given you
a year's severance.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.538
That's double salary
in 12 months.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.875
That's good
for you and... and Ralph.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.111
Go to hell.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.879
Paige? Paige?

40:49.881 --> 40:51.881
Uh...

40:51.883 --> 40:53.883
Hey, Paige?

40:53.884 --> 40:55.884
I have to say,
you're acting irrationally.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.620
You've done great work here.
The job is over.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.022
And I found you new employment

40:59.024 --> 41:02.192
for twice the money.
So why... why are you mad at me?

41:02.194 --> 41:03.860
The fact that you think
you've made progress

41:03.862 --> 41:05.895
when you're pulling
something like this...

41:06.898 --> 41:08.898
I am getting off
this crazy train for good.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.934
Good luck, Scorpion. Ralph.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.869
Let's go.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.815
What did you do?

41:25.817 --> 41:29.586
I made an executive decision.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.554
It's in my right.

41:32.891 --> 41:36.192
Man, this party sucks.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.528
You are the one brain
I can't crack, 197.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.967
I don't think I want to.

41:43.969 --> 41:46.269
Don't always like
what goes on in there.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.219

42:04.689 --> 42:07.023
