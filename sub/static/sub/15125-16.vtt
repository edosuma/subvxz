WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:06.974
Oh, good, you're home.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.176
In Hippo Cheese Candy Mouse,

00:08.209 --> 00:09.843
how many moves
before I get to flip

00:09.877 --> 00:11.312
the army man
into the bathtub?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.580
Two hippo chomps,

00:12.613 --> 00:14.215
and one slide
down Candy Cane Lane.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.649
Yahtz-cheese! I win.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.251
Could've solved this
an hour ago.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.719
What took you
so long to get home?

00:18.752 --> 00:19.887
Ah, I stopped to watch
the neighbor kids

00:19.920 --> 00:21.389
doing backflips
off their porch.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.490
You should've seen it.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.657
They were all wearing helmets.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.925
(groans)
Wussies.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.227
We're raising our kids
to be chickens.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.829
Seat belts, vitamins,
pool fences?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.664
I almost got up on that porch,
showed them how to do it.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.566
Like you could
still do a backflip.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.035
What are you saying?
I'm saying I dare you to try it.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.538
(Virginia and Jimmy repeating
"No!" over and over)

00:39.140 --> 00:41.442
JIMMY:
What Sabrina didn't know
was that my dad hadn't

00:41.475 --> 00:43.544
turned down a dare in 25 years.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.946
You know what?

00:45.979 --> 00:47.848
Let's just kiss here
and go back down.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.283
What are you talking about?

00:49.317 --> 00:50.751
We need to kiss on the
top of the radio antenna

00:50.784 --> 00:52.120
before Gavin and Cindy!

00:52.153 --> 00:53.687
Yeah, I don't know.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.755
I just feel weird.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.023
If we fall,
it's not gonna be

00:56.056 --> 00:57.125
like the cartoons.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.526
I mean, sure we may flatten out

00:58.559 --> 01:00.461
or make a hole
in the shape of our bodies,

01:00.494 --> 01:01.929
but we're not gonna survive it.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.631
Are you scared?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.966
No, I just think
that we should go back down

01:05.999 --> 01:07.768
to the ground instead
of being unresponsible.

01:07.801 --> 01:11.305
Hey, everybody,
Chance is wussing out!

01:11.339 --> 01:13.407
Scaredy-pants Chance!

01:13.441 --> 01:15.576
Thanks, Burt. Now Cindy
Holbrook is gonna be

01:15.609 --> 01:18.579
the first pregnant teen to kiss
on top of the radio antenna.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.214
TEENAGERS (chanting):
Scaredy-pants Chance!

01:20.248 --> 01:21.949
From that day on,

01:21.982 --> 01:24.218
my dad's been trying
to save his reputation.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.654
And that's why he's
never turned down a dare.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.425
Why in the world
would you try to launch

01:31.459 --> 01:33.394
a bottle rocket
from your butt?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.829
Where else am I gonna put it--
my mouth?

01:35.863 --> 01:37.498
That's just stupid.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.766
(groans)

01:38.799 --> 01:41.068
Okay, what did you guys
dare him to do?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.736
(Burt grunting, kids exclaiming)

01:42.770 --> 01:44.438
(groaning)

01:44.472 --> 01:46.340
Mary Poppins was a liar!

01:46.374 --> 01:48.276
That's why we try not to let
people dare my dad anymore.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.645
JIMMY/VIRGINIA/SABRINA:
No, no! Oh!

01:51.679 --> 01:53.113
(labored):
Stuck it.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.682
(moans)

01:55.816 --> 01:57.751
Whoo!

01:57.785 --> 01:59.153
* Here we go

01:59.187 --> 02:02.323
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:02.356 --> 02:04.492
(moaning)

02:04.525 --> 02:07.195
(sighs) Burt, I'm really sorry.
Let me help you up.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.696
No. Don't help him.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.098
He needs to learn to
not do this anymore.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.833
Never. I'll never stop.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.968
Why don't you guys just...
dare him to stop?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.470
Apparently it's against
the rules.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.472
It's like wishing
for more wishes.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.308
Well, as much as I would love to
stay and discuss the fine print

02:20.341 --> 02:23.311
of my father's crazy dare
addiction, we got to go home.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.180
Yeah, we, uh... we promised
the sitter we'd be back, so...

02:26.214 --> 02:27.481
I don't know why you two

02:27.515 --> 02:29.183
are spending so much money
on sitters.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.785
You got two perfectly
responsible adults right here.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.554
Who's safer
than her grandparents?

02:33.587 --> 02:35.956
Well, it's just that sometimes
you guys are busy

02:35.989 --> 02:37.325
or injured.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.792
And Ashley's
really great.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.495
And Hope likes spending
time with her, so...

02:41.529 --> 02:43.063
It's probably 'cause
she lets her eat junk food

02:43.096 --> 02:44.565
and watch cartoons all day.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.867
No. That's what Hope likes
to do with you guys.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.470
Oh, that kid does like
her chocolate cake in a cone

02:49.503 --> 02:51.672
with sugar on top
while she watches South Park.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.642
Don't worry. We watch it
on the Spanish channel.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
She can't understand a thing.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.911
It's like Dora the Explorer

02:57.945 --> 02:59.547
if she had a friend
who was a flying Christmas poo.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.914
Yeah, Ashley reads to her,

03:00.948 --> 03:03.183
and they play arts and crafts
and games.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.686
And, plus, when we come home,
the house is just... spotless.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.154
She's perfect.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.356
Nobody's that perfect.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.190
Especially teenagers.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.092
I used to babysit,

03:12.125 --> 03:15.095
and I had all kinds of parties
when the parents would leave.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.530
Fortunately,
I was able

03:16.564 --> 03:18.532
to parlay that
into a successful career.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.534
That's how she got so good
at cleaning houses.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.002
Ashley doesn't do any of that.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.037
Well, all I'm saying is,
you guys have no idea

03:24.071 --> 03:26.106
what she's up to
whenever you're not looking.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.608
(horn honks)

03:27.641 --> 03:29.743
(soft whirring)

03:37.117 --> 03:39.253
Thanks for everything,
Hubert.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.956
Oh. The buffet
was wonderful.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.392
Call me.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.026
No, I-I'll call you.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.728
Oh.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.763
VIRGINIA:
Where were you?

03:49.797 --> 03:51.699
(horn honks twice)
I thought you were taking a nap.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.233
Hubert took me to dinner.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.402
It's 4:00.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
We got a late start.

03:55.903 --> 03:56.937
Did you get a boyfriend,
Maw Maw?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.238
It's none of your beeswax

03:58.272 --> 03:59.773
who I spend my time with.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.275
I just don't think
I like you being with someone

04:01.309 --> 04:03.110
that we've never met before.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.145
I mean, we don't even know what
his children do for a living.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.914
Or if they are living.
You know what,

04:06.947 --> 04:08.716
I think it's very cute you
found somebody your own age

04:08.749 --> 04:10.050
to spend your
time with.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.552
Aren't too many of those left.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.321
It's nothing serious.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.690
I'm gonna go write this down
in my diary before I forget it.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.065
Damn it.
Where the hell was I going?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.734
Going to write in your diary.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.436
Stay out of my business!

04:30.771 --> 04:32.072
Hope was easy
as always.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.574
Took her nap
without saying a word.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.576
All right. Thank you
so much, Ashley.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.511
We'll see you tomorrow night.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.613
Sabrina, get in here.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.751
What?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.953
I found these empty rolls
of toilet paper in the bathroom.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.355
And there's no ice

04:47.388 --> 04:49.189
in the freezer.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.192
I think my mom might be right.
Ashley had people over.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.362
We don't know that.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.331
Oh, yeah. The explanation is
that she had a party.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.099
Where a lot of people peed.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.369
And that's not all.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.804
Look at this.
Couch blanket's on the chair,

05:03.837 --> 05:05.439
chair blanket is on the couch.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.307
What's she doing
under the blankets, Sabrina?

05:07.341 --> 05:10.478
She's having the sex
while our daughter watches.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.180
Jimmy, I don't even think
teenagers do it under blankets.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.816
I mean, that comes way later in
life when you're super ashamed.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.818
The garage.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.722
Jimmy, you're
overreacting.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.492
The moving around of blankets
does not an orgy make.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.026
Don't try and quote Shakespeare
to confuse me.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.628
You know what, while you're
going through there,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.062
I just feel like
I should mention

05:29.096 --> 05:30.831
I can't find that
"Number One Wife" sweatshirt

05:30.864 --> 05:31.865
you got me.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.300
And on the
outside chance

05:33.333 --> 05:34.968
that Hope might have
put it in there...

05:35.002 --> 05:36.504
Look what I found.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.811
Oh. Sticky and sweet
like a strawberry daiquiri.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.146
Now, the only people that drink
those are in high school

05:46.179 --> 05:47.681
or on cruise ships.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.850
Jimmy, my first drink
was a strawberry daiquiri.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.885
I think you might be right.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.387
Guess I'm "smarter
than the average bear."

05:53.421 --> 05:54.988
That's right.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.524
You're not the only one
that can quote Shakespeare.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.392
VIRGINIA:
Ew.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.895
Burt... (sniffs) I think the
skunks are in the house again.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.765
You know what, at this point,
I think they want it more

06:04.798 --> 06:06.266
than we do.
Just let them have it.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.868
(groans)
You can't even get out of bed

06:07.901 --> 06:09.770
'cause of all
those stupid dares.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.705
(groans)
Ow.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.543
(sniffing)

06:24.552 --> 06:26.420
Maw Maw...

06:26.454 --> 06:29.189
(groans)
I think there's a skunk
in there with you.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.459
(Maw Maw and Hubert
laughing, snorting)

06:31.492 --> 06:34.895
Maw Maw, who's in there
with you?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.364
Hey, chill.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.634
I'm just hanging with a friend.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.903
And if ten pizzas show up,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.738
(whispers):
they're for me.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.274
(beeping)

06:47.307 --> 06:49.943
This little robot thing
won't stop beeping.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.411
(chuckles)

06:51.445 --> 06:53.146
That's a smoke detector.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.116
Oh, cool. I'm looking
for some smokes.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.452
Smokey!

06:58.486 --> 06:59.887
(beeping continues)
Here, Smokey.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.388
Smokey.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.092
Smokey.
Come on, boy.
(coughs) God.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.298
Maw Maw,
what are you thinking?

07:11.331 --> 07:15.503
I'm thinking it's my house,
and I can do anything I want.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.071
Oh, I don't want to hear
this "my house" stuff.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.607
You're getting high!

07:19.640 --> 07:21.141
We weren't getting high!

07:21.174 --> 07:24.344
I am so freaking high.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.814
Hang in my room, Hubert.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.950
This one's full of buzz kills
and narcs.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.752
Comprende, mamacita.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
Burt, I think it would be best
if you got that guy dressed

07:33.854 --> 07:35.823
and out of our house.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.158
That guy has a name.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.628
I just can't remember
what it is right now.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.195
Neither can I.
(chuckles)

07:42.229 --> 07:44.297
Hey, how's the back?
(Burt groans)

07:44.331 --> 07:45.432
Maw Maw,

07:45.465 --> 07:46.934
you're not thinking straight.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.435
You can't smoke pot here.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.870
What if Hope visits?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.172
She eats crap all day
and watches cartoons.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.441
It's like hanging out
with a stoner anyway.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.510
I can't get those.
Sciatica.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.112
(bones cracking)
(moans)
Well, I can't either.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.948
Backflip off the hot tub.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.783
Sounds like we're in a pickle.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.186
Dude, how good would a pickle be
right now?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.888
(chuckles)
Ooh.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.990
You cannot be doing
illegal drugs.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.291
They're not illegal.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.827
Hubert has a pot card
for back pain.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.495
Did he ever consider
maybe his back hurts

08:15.529 --> 08:17.497
from carrying around
a giant bong?

08:17.531 --> 08:19.199
Quit hassling me, Nixon.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.201
Marijuana is a gateway drug.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.571
It leads to harder things.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.808
Hubert has a little blue pill
that leads to harder things.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.809
He's a loser.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.177
We're in love!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.179
Oh, give me a break.
You're not in love.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.647
We are, too! Look.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.717
He gave me this bracelet.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.153
I'm telling
you, Burt,

08:40.187 --> 08:44.558
if you play it backwards, it
clearly says, "Paul is dead."

08:44.592 --> 08:46.493
Then they replaced him
with a robot,

08:46.526 --> 08:49.029
and that's why he's pretty much
the only one that's still alive.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.165
So much makes sense
in this room.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.366
Yeah.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.167
Hubert and I are gonna
be together

08:54.201 --> 08:55.603
till the day we die.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.171
I want you to stop seeing him.
Whatever.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.940
Hey. Don't you
"whatever" me, old lady.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.709
As long as you're living
under my care,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.578
you're gonna
follow my rules.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.580
Whatever.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.515
Don't "whatever"
me, young lady.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.051
As long as you're under my care,
you'll follow my rules!

09:11.084 --> 09:12.419
We didn't even go all the way!

09:12.452 --> 09:14.554
You didn't get that
from a toilet seat!

09:14.588 --> 09:16.624
I was talking
about the antenna tower.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.926
I don't want to hear
what you call his doodle noodle.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.728
You're so lame!

09:20.761 --> 09:22.763
You're so lame.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.765
Oh, my God.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.867
I am.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.369
Did you know Jerry
Garcia was a musician
before he got into ice cream?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.304
See you later, hot stuff.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.607
Ooh...

09:33.641 --> 09:35.909
(both moaning)

09:37.911 --> 09:40.080
(Virginia clearing throat)

09:42.182 --> 09:43.817
I don't think
they're taking the hint.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.585
I'm not trying to give a hint.
That's the sound I make

09:45.619 --> 09:48.421
when I'm trying
to keep my vomit down.
(clears throat)

09:53.526 --> 09:55.328
(sighs)

09:55.362 --> 09:56.296
What's wrong?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.731
I think she's right.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.767
I am lame.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.935
What are you talking about?

10:02.803 --> 10:05.172
I'm the uncool parent.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.439
I'm the stick
in the mud.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.809
I have become lame.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.678
No, you haven't.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.480
Face it, Burt. A wild
Saturday night for us now

10:13.513 --> 10:17.685
is rum raisin ice cream
and startling raccoons.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.953
When was the last time
you did something illegal?

10:19.987 --> 10:22.455
At a fast food restaurant,
I asked for a water cup

10:22.489 --> 10:24.825
and I put lemonade in it.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.459
It was an accident,
and I apologized.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.129
I poured it out, and I paid
for it. But still...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.964
pretty reckless.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.668
Okay, maybe we are lame.
(sighs)

10:34.702 --> 10:36.136
Hey, did you guys know

10:36.169 --> 10:40.207
that I have diabetes
and a peanut allergy?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.842
That's not your bracelet,
Maw Maw.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.044
My name is Hubert.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.454
What is this,
a surprise inspection?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.858
I'm an old woman
reading in bed. Busted.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.393
No. I just wanted to say

11:00.427 --> 11:03.163
maybe earlier
I overreacted a little.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.965
And I should trust you.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.367
Thank you, Virginia.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.003
All right. Sweet dreams.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.342
Hey.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.877
If your closet smells like weed,

11:16.910 --> 11:19.512
it's because I was just
in your closet smoking weed.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.883
And if it smells like pee,
well, I'm old.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.953
Come here,
you silver-tongued devil.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.491
I wish we didn't have to
sneak around like this.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.360
Stress is bad for my heart.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.829
I'm sorry.
She just doesn't get us.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.998
She forgets what it was like.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.100
I wish we could just
run away together,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.169
some place where we
wouldn't be judged.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.105
The running sounds like
a little bit too much.

11:45.138 --> 11:49.009
But maybe there's somewhere
we could walk to... slowly.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.479
Come on. I've only got three
hours before the pill wears off.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.054
What the Frank
is going on?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.290
Afternoon, Mrs. Chance.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.725
He's installing nanny cams to
help us keep an eye on Ashley.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.194
We didn't agree to this.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.597
Au contraire, mon friendo.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.065
Okay, all right.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.435
I'm not saying "no"
to the idea of the nanny cam.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.207
Don't worry.
It's not gonna be weird.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.775
There's not gonna be
any wires, or...

12:21.809 --> 12:23.710
She's not gonna even know
where the cameras are.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.145
Does there happen
to be one hidden

12:25.178 --> 12:26.546
in the novelty-sized
can of baked beans

12:26.579 --> 12:29.316
sitting on
the bookshelf?
(whirring)

12:29.349 --> 12:32.252
Blind luck, and you'll never
find the others.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.586
Banana taped to the window.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.925
Okay, now
you're freaking me out.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.427
You guys, why didn't you just
put it in the fruit bowl?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.761
She'd eat it!

12:42.695 --> 12:43.897
Teenagers love bananas.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.398
That's a known fact.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.301
Oh, wait. I might be thinking
of chimpanzees.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.170
Good call on the fruit bowl.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.506
Virginia, you
smoking again?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.142
I think I have to, Burt.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.643
I'm trying to get my cool back.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.112
I don't think the cool
kids are smoking anymore.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.680
They're not?

13:00.713 --> 13:03.183
No. They have computer
cigarettes now or something.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.986
I used to be the coolest girl
in Natesville.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.187
A wine cooler

13:07.220 --> 13:08.989
in one hand,
cigarette in the other

13:09.022 --> 13:10.357
and a bun in the oven.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.192
Man, the looks I used to get.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.995
It was cool going to parties
with a pregnant chick.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.097
You were living proof
that I'd had sex.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.599
Now we're just lame-os
who fall asleep at 9:00

13:19.632 --> 13:21.801
to the sound of Mark Harmon
solving crimes.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.837
Well, maybe if we accept

13:23.871 --> 13:26.273
that we're not cool anymore,
that makes us cool.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.375
Like that couple on TV with
the salt-and-pepper hair.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.977
They don't care
what anybody thinks.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.045
They want to take a bath
in the middle of a field,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.613
they don't ask permission.
They just do it.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.348
They are cool as hell.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.617
That's a commercial for people
who need pills to have sex.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.186
What?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.653
I thought it
was a commercial

13:40.687 --> 13:42.956
for cool people taking
outdoor baths, but

13:42.990 --> 13:44.324
this makes more sense.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.459
Because I was wondering
why a bathtub

13:46.493 --> 13:49.529
would give you dizziness
and four-hour erections.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.964
Do you know what?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.200
I refuse to just get
old and lame.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.801
I'm gonna fight this.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.170
I'm gonna do what every cool kid
in Natesville has done

13:57.204 --> 13:58.305
for the last 50 years.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.207
Moving to Tracetown?
No.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.143
I'm gonna climb
the radio antenna!

14:03.176 --> 14:06.546
And I dare you...
to climb it with me.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.815
Oh.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.151
Yeah.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.719
Damn it!
Virginia, wait up!

14:12.752 --> 14:14.321
Burt, look at us!

14:14.354 --> 14:16.689
I don't know if
it's the adrenaline

14:16.723 --> 14:19.592
or being just above
Natesville's smog layer,

14:19.626 --> 14:21.861
but I haven't felt
this cool in years!

14:21.895 --> 14:24.064
Cowabunga, dude!

14:24.097 --> 14:25.698
Ah!

14:25.732 --> 14:27.901
(groaning)

14:30.303 --> 14:33.873
Okay. We've done it!
Yeah.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.842
We win!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.911
We're cool.
Can we get down now?

14:37.945 --> 14:40.380
What are you talking about?
We're nowhere near the top.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.515
Well, the last time we did this,
this was the top.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.017
When everybody
got cell phones,

14:44.051 --> 14:46.053
they had to build
a bigger antenna.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.055
That's great!

14:48.088 --> 14:50.023
Oh, where you going?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.624
Cindy Holbrook might have
gotten here first,

14:51.658 --> 14:54.561
but I'm gonna be the first one
to get to the top.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
Mom?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.530
What? Jimmy?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.067
What the hell
are you guys doing up here?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.601
Virginia dared me.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.536
We're trying to be as cool
as when we were kids.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.704
Why are you here?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.373
Same reason.
Virginia dared you?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.909
No. We just felt lame.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.644
JIMMY:
Frank wired our place
with nanny cams

15:11.678 --> 15:13.313
so we could keep an eye
on Ashley.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.082
Then we went into the garage
and waited.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.985
We've been staring at this
hallway for 20 minutes.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.720
I knew we should have let Frank
put a camera in the bathroom.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.289
The words "Frank,"
"camera" and "bathroom"

15:22.322 --> 15:24.224
do not belong
in the same sentence.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.392
(Hope screams)

15:25.425 --> 15:27.127
I'm going in.
Wait, wait. Look.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.763
(Ashley growls playfully,
Hope laughs)

15:30.797 --> 15:32.432
Oh, my God!

15:32.465 --> 15:34.334
She let a mummy into our house.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.235
What?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.137
Wait. Hang on.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.272
(Hope laughing)
I think that might be Ashley.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.507
Good catch.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.009
JIMMY:
Turned out the blankets

15:42.042 --> 15:43.610
we thought teenagers
were having sex on

15:43.643 --> 15:45.345
were just part
of a pillow fort.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.514
And the cups we thought
were filled with daiquiris

15:47.547 --> 15:49.182
were just used
for strawberry smoothies.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.751
I feel like such an idiot
for not trusting her.

15:51.784 --> 15:56.089
It's like we have become
those paranoid parents.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.258
I know. Look how great she is.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.527
And now she's even
taking out the trash.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.129
Jimmy, that means she's...

16:02.162 --> 16:04.131
(gasps)
Hey.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.832
Were you guys spying on me?

16:05.865 --> 16:07.367
No. No, no, no, no, no.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.369
That is, like,
super creepy and lame.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.703
We're not lame.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.272
We were just...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.474
Uh, producing a new
reality show.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.510
And th was your audition.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.012
Mm-hmm. It's new.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.348
It's called
So You Think You Can Babysit.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.815
I'm so glad to hear

16:22.849 --> 16:24.517
you guys aren't really
a cashier and bagger.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.286
That sounded
like such a sad life.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.955
(Sabrina clears her throat)

16:28.988 --> 16:30.623
We got busted by a 17-year-old

16:30.657 --> 16:32.659
who's already cooler
than we ever were.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.495
Yeah, we felt really lame,
so we did the same thing

16:35.528 --> 16:37.564
every cool kid
in Natesville has always done--

16:37.597 --> 16:39.132
climb the antenna.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.000
Natesville really ought
to invest in a water park.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.336
Or at least some kind of
rec room with a dart board.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.804
What are you two doing?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.207
Stop talking
and get down right now!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.641
You're parents now.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.643
You can't be unresponsible.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.812
If you fall,
it's not like in the cartoons.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.514
I mean, sure you might
flatten out

16:54.547 --> 16:57.084
or make a hole
in the shape of your bodies,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
but you're not gonna survive it.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.153
Oh, my God.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.355
Scaredy-pants Chance.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.191
(in adult Burt's voice):
Virginia, please don't mock me

17:04.224 --> 17:05.892
when I'm trying to be serious
with our son and his wife!

17:05.925 --> 17:09.429
No. You weren't scared
of breaking your neck at all.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.899
You were scared about who would
take care of us if you did.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.234
For the first time

17:14.267 --> 17:15.702
in your life,

17:15.735 --> 17:17.737
you were making
an adult, responsible decision.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.773
Huh. Maybe that's why
it felt so weird.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.276
I also just realized
you never should have thrown out

17:23.310 --> 17:25.345
your super-cool
puka shell necklace.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.946
But either way,

17:26.979 --> 17:30.583
you're still the bravest,
sexiest man I've ever met.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.852
Aw. (giggles)

17:32.885 --> 17:34.621
This is really sweet.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.955
What are you still doing here?!

17:35.988 --> 17:37.857
You have a daughter
to take care of!

17:37.890 --> 17:39.592
Dad's right.
We should go.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.893
Love you guys!

17:40.927 --> 17:42.595
Bye.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.030
That's right.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.434
Run home to your baby,
Scaredy-pants Chance!

17:47.467 --> 17:48.468
(spits)

17:48.501 --> 17:49.936
(laughs)
JIMMY:
Hey!

17:49.969 --> 17:51.638
It is actually
a pretty funny nickname.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.005
(laughs)

17:56.276 --> 17:58.111
(gasps)

17:58.145 --> 18:00.447
We did it!
We're at the top!

18:00.480 --> 18:03.250
Screw you,
Cindy Holbrook!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.952
Oh. Oh. You know what?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.920
If I'm being honest,

18:07.954 --> 18:11.558
this isn't really making me
feel a whole lot cooler.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.825
Yeah, me, neither.
(groans)

18:12.859 --> 18:15.061
Maybe we're not
gonna be cool anymore.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.830
Maybe, from now on,
we just get lamer and lamer.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.299
Then we die of lameness.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
Yeah, maybe so.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.437
Promise me you'll
grow lame with me?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.573
I think I'll be able
to handle it better

18:26.606 --> 18:27.807
if we go through
it together.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.309
Me, too.
Yeah.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.644
Let's grow old gracefully
like Cher or Carrot Top.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.946
Does that mean you're not
going to do any more dares?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.315
Oh, I think I'm over that.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.584
Maybe just
one last one?
Uh...

18:37.617 --> 18:39.186
I dare you to kiss me.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.421
Ah!

18:41.454 --> 18:42.855
Mmm.
Yeah, we did it!

18:42.889 --> 18:45.258
We kissed on top
of the tower!
(whoops)

18:45.292 --> 18:47.026
We're not lame!

18:47.059 --> 18:49.829
We're just like all the other
cool people in this town.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.432
(sighs)
Incredibly stupid.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.001
I wish someone could have
seen us up here.
I know.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.337
I bet we're the oldest
people to do this.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.105
(helicopter blades whirring)
What?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.440
MAN (over speaker):
Freeze! This is the police!

19:00.473 --> 19:01.808
Whoa! What?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.109
You are trespassing
on government property.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.111
Hey! Yes!

19:05.144 --> 19:07.947
Everybody's gonna
hear about this!

19:07.980 --> 19:10.383
(whooping)
Hey!

19:15.054 --> 19:17.957
MAW MAW:
Dear diary, I don't care
what Virginia says.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.393
Hubert is the cat's pajamas.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.396
I think tonight's the night
I'll finally lose it.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.064
My eyesight.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.334
Can't even see
what I'm writing.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.638
Hubert!

19:31.671 --> 19:33.172
Hi, Barbara June.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.575
Okay, you got five minutes
to get your stuff together,

19:35.608 --> 19:36.976
and we're leaving here forever.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.411
Did we make a suicide pact?

19:38.445 --> 19:41.047
Because I did make one
with a pen pal once,

19:41.080 --> 19:43.683
and it didn't turn out too well.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.919
No, we're gonna hop
on my pimped out Get Around

19:46.953 --> 19:49.356
and we're gonna hit
the open sidewalk.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.024
Well, I don't know if I can
just pick up and leave.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.760
I have a family, I have a house.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.995
I met a new guy named Hubert.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.397
Come on, Barbara June.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.498
I want to feel

19:58.531 --> 20:00.032
the breeze rushing through

20:00.066 --> 20:03.870
what's left of my hair,
and I want you by my side.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.439
I really want to go with you.
I'm just scared.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.007
Relax, mamacita.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.810
Here, take a Quaalude.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.347
Oh, wait.
That's a stool softener.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.516
I better take that.
Oh.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.684
Here you go.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.018
Are you nuts?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.687
This stuff could kill us.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.121
So what if it does?

20:22.154 --> 20:23.956
At least we'll die
with smiles on our faces,

20:23.990 --> 20:25.758
and a little bit of vomit
'cause sometimes

20:25.792 --> 20:27.960
those Quaaludes will make you
choke on your own tongue.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.729
My family's
very important to me,

20:29.762 --> 20:32.432
and-and they're good,
responsible people.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.967
Hey, Maw Maw.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.403
Remember Officer Steve
and Officer Mark?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.071
Oh, no. What did you two idiots
do now?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.240
You'll read about it
in tomorrow's newspaper.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.542
And only in the newspaper.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.043
Apparently, we
kicked some wires

20:44.076 --> 20:45.912
and knocked out all
the local TV stations.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.580
Hello, Officers.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.948
I'm ex-congressman

20:48.981 --> 20:51.484
Hubert Wilson,
and I think we can all agree

20:51.518 --> 20:54.787
that it would be better
if I were left out of this.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.994
I'm not angry.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.397
I'm just disappointed.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.132
It's fun being
in trouble.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.934
Makes me feel like
a teenager again.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.504
Me, too. Please don't
take away our phone privileges.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.105
I'm taking away
your phone privileges!

21:13.139 --> 21:14.674
As long as you
don't ground us.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.943
You're grounded!
Go to your room!

21:16.976 --> 21:18.911
(Virginia laughs)

21:18.945 --> 21:20.813
Thank you for
caring so much.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.990
What's this?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.292
Guess I forgot
to take my vitamin.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.862
