WEBVTT

02:21.558 --> 02:23.309
Good morning.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.885
Who puts
the flowers out there?

02:57.970 --> 03:00.721
Can't say for sure. Why?

03:00.806 --> 03:03.057
Could be the sign
of a guilty conscience.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.394
Out here,
we just call it "Being nice."

03:06.478 --> 03:08.938
Or maybe,
whoever's doing it is superstitious.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.732
Yeah? How so?

03:11.817 --> 03:15.069
Well, they figure
if they honor the dead,

03:15.153 --> 03:19.448
maybe their kids
won't end up like them two girls did.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.033
That's just magical thinking.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.412
You ever been out to the creek,

03:24.580 --> 03:26.455
where Ann Nash's body
was found, Detective?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.748
Yeah.

03:27.833 --> 03:32.169
Well, it's just smooth water
rolling over sand, now.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.255
Well, after Ann died,

03:34.339 --> 03:36.757
the townsfolk went out there
and pulled the rocks out.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.261
The same ones
that snagged the clothesline

03:40.345 --> 03:41.637
that was around Ann's neck.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.514
They loaded them into a pickup truck,

03:43.682 --> 03:46.434
took them out to the edge of town,
and smashed 'em.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.769
Nice and smooth.

03:48.896 --> 03:54.025
Like they figured that destroying them
would ward off any future evil.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.070
Well, I guess
they left a rock, or two.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.810
How does it fit?

04:29.895 --> 04:33.189
I have a navy,
I mean, if you'd rather.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.025
No, I just think my hips
are a little higher than yours.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.193
Curvy.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.572
It's fine. I'm fine, fine.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.082
Let me do that.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.843
This funeral is going to be very hard.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.429
I loved those girls.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.056
How did you know those girls, again?

05:07.432 --> 05:12.186
Camille, I'm very involved in
the community. It's our family's duty.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.071
More dead little girls.
As if Marian wasn't enough.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.614
Were you friends with Natalie?

05:23.699 --> 05:26.867
Enough to be sad, too,
which is why I should go.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.453
You're gonna stay here with Gayla,
and have ice cream.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.581
I want to know where you are.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.458
Camille, maybe,
you should stay back, too,

05:34.960 --> 05:38.796
-given your state of mind.
-I have to go. It's my job.

05:38.922 --> 05:43.467
I think Camille knows how to behave.
Adora, we don't want to be late.

05:43.552 --> 05:48.639
We're fine. And I don't want you
to talk like that, like it's work.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.225
We're going to the funeral
to support that poor family.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.229
Ladies, can we please go?

05:55.313 --> 05:56.605
Yes.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.654
I love you, love you, love you.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.990
- Are you gonna ride with us?
- No, no. I'm gonna drive.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.491
I have to grab my purse.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.579
- I'll wait in the car.
- All right.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.667
Morning.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.002
Kansas City.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.004
You know, I've been thinking.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.967
Why does a killer
change his MO like that?

06:25.052 --> 06:29.430
The first body left at the kill site
in the forest, but Natalie,

06:29.514 --> 06:33.809
she's dumped in the middle of town
like a prop, or a doll.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.352
My daughter had one of them dolls.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.981
Little "O" for a mouth.
Creepy little fucking things.

06:39.066 --> 06:43.069
Getting her there was risky.
Way more chance of getting caught.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.905
Well, some killers want to get caught.
A cry for help.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.491
This one likes making
people scared for their girls.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.494
Can we just save The Silence
of the Lambs routine for another time?

06:52.120 --> 06:56.040
Look, Bill, I get it, okay.
This is your home.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.666
You gotta look out for your people,

06:57.751 --> 07:00.002
but odds are
the killer is gonna show up here.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.295
Soak up the atmosphere.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.297
I read them books, too,
Agent Starling.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.758
Watch out for anyone trying to
insert himself into the action.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.259
Anyone trying too hard
with the family.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.386
The nature of this crime,
it's personal.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.055
This guy wants to rule the town.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.518
Well, he may not rule it,
but he sure as hell got our attention.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.148
-Look good?
-That's fine.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.317
Yeah, I know you're fond of me,

07:23.401 --> 07:25.486
but don't think
this means we're married.

07:33.745 --> 07:38.582
Come on in, Mrs. Crellin.
This way, please. Sorry, folks.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.509
I'm so sorry.

07:56.518 --> 08:01.272
Come on, Sweetie. I saved you a place.
Get your cute, little butt in here.

08:02.774 --> 08:07.820
Good Lord. I don't think
I've seen you in a month of Sundays.

08:07.946 --> 08:11.240
-You saw me at the search, Jackie.
-I didn't really see you.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.034
See, it was that sweet tea,
and its kick.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.246
Please tell me y'all
aren't waiting on us.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.915
Well, we weren't waiting
for the pastor. That's for sure.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.668
You look great.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.253
I don't know what I expected.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.424
-You look absolutely...
-Jackie, inside voice. It's a funeral.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.343
You look great.

08:41.229 --> 08:45.441
They can't release the body
because of the investigation.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.278
Can you even imagine?

08:59.080 --> 09:02.666
That's Natalie's mama and daddy.
They're divorced.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.878
They keep to themselves.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.765
We gather here, to celebrate

09:17.849 --> 09:19.350
the life of Natalie Keene.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.437
Her death is a great tragedy,

09:23.563 --> 09:27.733
but we must
turn our hearts to the light.

09:27.817 --> 09:32.196
We begin with some words of comfort
from Natalie's mother, Jeannie Keene.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.948
Jeannie?

09:42.999 --> 09:46.293
Natalie was a surprise baby,

09:46.419 --> 09:49.338
but we were grateful for her.

09:49.422 --> 09:54.677
Almost six years
after our sweet son, a girl.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.932
I taped a pink ribbon
to her little, bald head.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.141
She snatched it off.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.103
Six weeks old,
and our girl knew what she wanted.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.064
She was always like that.

10:07.148 --> 10:12.820
A spitfire, a contrarian,
a tomboy, a goofball.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.948
Smart as a whip,
she didn't suffer fools.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.411
I remember when she was two,
I was making goo-goo eyes at her.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.539
I swear she rolled her eyes.

10:23.665 --> 10:28.585
In our first home in Philadelphia,
she'd sneak out and explore the city.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.796
In Wind Gap, she roamed the woods,

10:30.880 --> 10:34.925
and would report back to us
on everything she saw.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.219
She talked a lot...

10:41.182 --> 10:45.686
She talked a lot
when she had something to say.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.772
And was quiet if she didn't.

10:49.107 --> 10:52.735
I wish more grown-ups had that gift.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.404
It is horrible to lose a child.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.199
It is unbearable to lose her this way,

10:59.826 --> 11:02.202
to a murdering fiend.

11:03.288 --> 11:08.208
I know I'm supposed to be forgiving,
but I am furious.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.127
I know what good people say.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.965
"An eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind."

11:15.091 --> 11:17.092
I wish I could be that gentle.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.512
I want revenge.

11:20.597 --> 11:24.475
I want justice

11:24.601 --> 11:26.977
for her daddy,

11:27.062 --> 11:30.939
who will never get to walk her
down the aisle.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.360
For her brother,
who was her best friend.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.821
And for me,

11:37.947 --> 11:41.575
who will never, ever

11:41.701 --> 11:43.494
recover from her loss.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.497
We love you, Natalie.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.143
Heaven does, indeed,
have another angel,

12:49.310 --> 12:53.897
but we must know that Natalie has gone
to a better place, to sit with God.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.692
Camille, please.
For the sake of the family, please.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.445
Now, would you please stand
as we say, together, the words

12:59.529 --> 13:00.863
Our Savior Christ has taught us?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.243
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

13:06.995 --> 13:08.704
hallowed be Thy name,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.748
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.501
on Earth as it is in heaven.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.629
Give us this day our daily bread,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.965
and forgive us our trespasses,

13:20.091 --> 13:23.385
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.929
And lead us not into temptation,

13:26.055 --> 13:27.723
but deliver us from evil.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.332
-Hi, Sammie.
-Hi.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.943
-Hey, sis.
-What are you doing here?

14:21.069 --> 14:24.655
Shouldn't you be home,
eating ice cream?

14:24.781 --> 14:28.116
Any chance I can
bum a few bucks for the Sprite?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.660
-Sprite?
-Yeah.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.245
Sure.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.625
I knew you'd be cool.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.127
You all, isn't my sister the coolest?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.629
-So cool.
-So cool.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.089
So cool.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.590
Don't try to work me, Amma.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.759
I've been playing
that game for 20 years.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.969
- Twenty years?
- Yeah.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.346
Then you're old enough to be my mom.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.182
-Do you know my mom?
-Shut up, Jodes.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.519
Amma, Mama wants you home,
and I want you home.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.189
It's dangerous out there for you.
People are killing little girls.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.775
Not the cool ones.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.403
Yeah, we're going
straight to Kelsey's,

15:04.487 --> 15:05.654
and I'll be home before curfew.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.322
I swear.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.991
Straight there?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.409
And you call me if you need a ride?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.327
-You promise?
-Yeah, I promise.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.745
Thank you.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.122
Make sure you get home before...

15:15.206 --> 15:18.125
-Mama?
-Yeah. Okay.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.210
Amma. Careful with the vodka.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.461
Yeah.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.172
-Thank you, girls.
-Thank you, Sammie.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.550
- Bye, girls.
- Bye!

15:26.968 --> 15:30.220
Jeannie Keene is having
all the mourners over to her house.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.597
I think that's pretty nice.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.266
When Marian died,
Mama shuttered our house

15:34.392 --> 15:35.892
for a year with us inside.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.230
Listen. I know this is
delicate ground for you.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.941
-It's not.
-Okay, well, good.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.611
Then get as many personal details
as you can,

15:45.695 --> 15:47.613
and, remember, you're not there

15:47.697 --> 15:49.197
-to solve the mystery.
-Yeah.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.616
Well, the brother interests me.

15:50.908 --> 15:55.662
He's not your typical Wind Gap fare.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.833
Excellent. We want characters.
Tell us about the Keene house.

15:59.917 --> 16:04.755
Are Natalie's shoes still out?
Are the photos friendly, or familiar?

16:04.839 --> 16:06.423
Piano, books?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.383
Are the paintings
on the wall original,

16:08.468 --> 16:11.303
or from Antiques 'R' Us, like ours?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.473
Well, why don't I go
through the ice box while I'm at it?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.642
Hey, don't be a wise-ass, kiddo.
You know what I mean.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.977
This could be your big break
if you do it right.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.813
-You gotta stop saying that.
-All right.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.067
Don't go gentle.
Get what you need for this story.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.612
-You're right. Yes, sir.
-Okay, kiddo.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.031
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.625
-If you're about to say...
-"You can't solve all the problems

16:41.709 --> 16:43.043
-"of the entire world?"
-The other one.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.420
-"Hope you know what you're doing?"
-Bingo.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.549
I understand what you're trying to do,
but what she needs now, is time.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.218
Don't we all?

16:52.470 --> 16:54.846
Look, she's a great investigator,
could be a great writer,

16:54.931 --> 16:59.101
maybe even have a life,
but she needs to deal with her issues.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.937
And stop thinking
that vodka doesn't stay on her breath.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.439
You can't fix her
like another thing in this house.

17:05.316 --> 17:09.611
Not now. Can't take that on, too.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.737
I'll think about it.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.157
-No, I will.
-Yeah, right.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.211
Yeah, right!

18:54.175 --> 18:55.675
I don't care
who told you to come!

18:55.760 --> 18:56.968
Get the fuck out of this house!

18:57.053 --> 18:59.888
Get out of this house! Come on!
Don't make me tell you again!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.556
Just beat it! Get out of here!

19:01.641 --> 19:03.308
- Fuck you!
- Mr. Keene, come on, now.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.476
Beat it!

19:04.560 --> 19:06.603
Shut it!

19:06.687 --> 19:09.064
Son of a bitch!

19:39.679 --> 19:41.680
She thought
that was a good idea, too.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.806
I agree.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.860
Well, well, well.
Camille's here.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.615
I'm not sure that's so.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.995
Adora says it's a comfort
having Marian's room.

20:11.002 --> 20:16.047
The little bitch
just waltzed right in here.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.931
No, patrol is what we do.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.601
No, I say, we start over
on the beaner side of town.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.019
Think about it.
A man who could slaughter

20:29.103 --> 20:30.854
pigs all day, that's the type of man

20:30.938 --> 20:32.439
that can yank out
a little girl's teeth.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.025
- All that blood.
- Okay, Chris, stop.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.318
You know where you're going?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.987
Stumbling back to your bed is where.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.572
I brought John some food.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.574
You need to eat, John.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.911
Ashley, John will eat
when he wants to eat. Thank you.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.913
Okay.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.252
Would you look at them?

20:54.337 --> 20:56.922
Just sitting all by themselves
in a group of people.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.008
And then they wonder why
they're not a part of this town.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.886
The funeral was nice, at least.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.931
Well, that girl
she described is not Natalie.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.390
Believe me. I should know.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.399
Appreciate it.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.710
Deputy Coroner's office.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.177
Camille! I heard
you were back in town.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.137
Watch the liquor, watch the men.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.931
I'm kidding.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.392
How are you?
You never come home.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.644
Well, she's in big-shit St. Louis.

21:52.770 --> 21:53.853
I love St. Louis.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.814
Dan and I took the girls there
after Christmas last year.

21:55.898 --> 21:59.484
Jack and I were thinking about that.
Taking the kids for a visit.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.902
I have four, all boys.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.280
- Do you have kids, Camille?
- Here.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.866
-I said I'm not hungry.
-Fine.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.744
- Fuck it.
- Sorry.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.496
I guess I have five boys.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.207
What about you, Camille?
You must have a boyfriend.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.126
Do you guys know the Keene family?

22:16.210 --> 22:18.795
You know, Angie's due
in September. Look at this.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.506
-Congratulations.
-I know I look big.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.758
I get bigger every time.
What can you do?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.468
So, the brother, John,

22:25.553 --> 22:27.429
he seems to be taking
the death kind of...

22:27.513 --> 22:29.222
He's been crying up a storm.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.058
-I don't mean to be mean...
-Sure, you do.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.811
But it's a bit much.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.522
It's like he's a little boy.
A lot of tears.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.065
Well, did he fit in at school?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.901
Little Ashley Wheeler made sure
he fit in with the right crowd.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.447
She's a cheerleader.
Like us in the day, right?

22:45.531 --> 22:47.907
- Yeah.
- Until you quit us.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.368
But he is an odd damn duck.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.705
He seems sorta gay to me.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.624
I mean, that would make sense.
If he's the one who did it.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.836
Because sometimes, when siblings
have unnatural affections,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.713
that leads to other things.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.673
God, you watch too much news.

23:03.758 --> 23:04.799
Camille Preaker!

23:04.884 --> 23:06.342
So damn sick
of your damn theories.

23:06.427 --> 23:07.886
You owe me a scoop...

23:07.970 --> 23:11.347
-It was nice catching up.
-...reporter girl.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.349
I hate her dress.

23:13.476 --> 23:14.934
Thank you.

23:16.353 --> 23:20.190
What are you doing
with those nasty vipers? Lord!

23:21.776 --> 23:24.569
I'm so happy to see you.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.905
I mean, your mother shows me
pictures of you, but...

23:27.073 --> 23:29.324
She does? What pictures?

23:29.408 --> 23:33.787
Well, she paints a picture of you.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.706
-She's so proud.
-I do not believe you, Jackie.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.875
Well, that's 'cause I lie like a rug.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.711
You turned out so...

23:41.921 --> 23:44.547
Wonderful, smart, beautiful,

23:44.715 --> 23:48.176
successful, and brave.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.888
-You do lie, Jackie.
-No, I mean it.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.682
I mean it. You tackled those demons.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.311
My demons are not remotely tackled.
They're just mildly concussed.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.982
Well, I'd say that's better than
the rest of us, isn't it?

24:03.150 --> 24:06.111
-How's your mama doing?
-She's sad.

24:06.237 --> 24:10.782
I wish you knew her
before Marian. She was lovely,

24:11.534 --> 24:13.743
and frivolous, like a kite.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.205
You still lying, Jackie?

24:17.331 --> 24:19.582
I don't think so.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.132
You're the best.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.541
I didn't want him to starve.

25:46.629 --> 25:50.298
I'm sorry for your loss.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.092
She stunned ants
and fed them to her spiders.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.011
It was nasty,

25:55.095 --> 25:59.224
but it was good for Natalie,
the outdoors.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.145
Well,

26:04.271 --> 26:08.191
sounds like she was a tomboy.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.735
Was she playing outside
when she went missing?

26:10.819 --> 26:14.697
Overly Park. Broad daylight.

26:14.823 --> 26:19.077
I heard that she was
friends with Ann Nash.

26:21.872 --> 26:26.167
Until they weren't.
Fine by me they fell out.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.212
That dad, he's a strange one.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.924
Have the police talked to you?

26:33.008 --> 26:37.512
They usually question the family,
these kind of cases.

26:37.846 --> 26:42.183
I was in Philly at the time,
if that's what you're asking.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.771
What about your son?

26:46.897 --> 26:51.818
My son loved Natalie.
He would've died before hurting her.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.951
Ninety-seven, over.

27:12.339 --> 27:16.009
You can't just go into the room
of a dead little girl.

27:16.802 --> 27:21.055
You of all people should know
how private, how personal that is.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.474
Well, I was just...

27:25.102 --> 27:27.395
I don't know how this family

27:27.479 --> 27:30.315
will ever get over it.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.233
We didn't.

27:36.697 --> 27:40.950
Go report somewhere else,
and let these people be.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.362
Marks on the gums
and inside the cheeks

28:17.446 --> 28:20.031
indicate that the teeth
were removed by pliers.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.621
-What kind of pliers?
-Household pliers.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.956
Sharp-edged pliers.

28:33.796 --> 28:36.005
How hard is it to pull a tooth?

28:36.090 --> 28:40.468
It takes some muscle.
Baby teeth come out a little easier.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.763
The killer would have
some adrenaline pumping,

28:43.847 --> 28:45.640
if he did it right away.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.990
Hi.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.659
What's your name?

29:07.830 --> 29:11.749
You know, you guys are the first kids
I've seen out playing by themselves.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.000
I ain't no pussy.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.089
I was wondering,
you know Natalie Keene?

29:19.049 --> 29:20.716
No.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.677
But you heard what happened.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.305
Yeah, from James Capisi first.

29:26.432 --> 29:30.393
He was here when it happened.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.519
Did he say who took her?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.106
The woman in white.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.484
Woman in white, like the story?

29:38.610 --> 29:41.654
Ask James Capisi.
Lives over on Crestwood.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.740
Yellow house with a tire swing.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.160
Would you show me?

29:47.244 --> 29:51.539
No, me and James
ain't friends no more. He got weird.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.418
After the woman in white?

29:56.044 --> 29:58.588
What'd she look like?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.596
Come on. Throw it, man!

30:21.445 --> 30:22.778
Dear.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.073
You look wan.

30:26.158 --> 30:30.119
I suppose I haven't
really eaten today.

30:30.204 --> 30:33.206
You can't go giving the girls
advice you don't follow.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.916
You need your strength.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.586
Now, now, go eat, you don't want
to look like a hairless cat.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.965
Don't.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.343
It's not right on a day like today.

30:45.427 --> 30:49.347
-Don't.
-That's not so.

30:49.431 --> 30:54.185
The Lord loves the world
and all its contradictions.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.938
I hope so.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.449
Sorry.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.457
Go get the ball, you idiot.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.094
Fucker.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.885
We don't need nothin'.
Church brung us food.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.095
James?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.014
I was just...

34:19.099 --> 34:22.226
I was talking
with your friend, little guy, mullet.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.602
Dee ain't no friend.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.897
Well, he was just
telling me about the woman in white.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.816
The one who took Natalie.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.651
She did.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.195
Well, did you tell the police that?

34:33.280 --> 34:37.032
Yes, ma'am.
They say I'm seeing ghosts.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.659
It's like the story.

34:38.827 --> 34:42.204
She ain't no ghost. It was real.

34:42.289 --> 34:45.499
-Did Natalie see her?
-We were playing.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.920
Ball went in the woods, so, she went.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.130
I hollered at her,

34:52.048 --> 34:54.300
but she was gone.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.598
You here by yourself?

35:02.350 --> 35:05.060
-Is your mama sick?
-She gets along all right.

35:05.312 --> 35:08.189
But I don't need no taking care of.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.401
Okay, so, I think
I need to talk to your mom, now.

35:19.993 --> 35:24.330
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

35:25.499 --> 35:28.709
Your son was
just in the window when I came by.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.879
He's playing with a gun.

35:31.963 --> 35:36.133
Why you care?

35:36.218 --> 35:38.636
Just seems a little young
to have a gun.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.847
Are we breaking some law,
or something?

35:41.932 --> 35:45.142
-I don't know.
-Then screw off.

35:45.227 --> 35:48.270
Mrs. Capisi...

35:48.355 --> 35:50.147
"Mrs. Capisi."

35:51.858 --> 35:53.442
I just wanted to talk to you about

35:53.527 --> 35:56.570
what your son saw
when Natalie Keene was taken.

35:59.199 --> 36:03.077
I'd talk for a fifty.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.746
I'm not allowed to pay for...

36:05.872 --> 36:08.833
Then I'm not allowed to talk.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.596
Mama!

36:27.102 --> 36:29.186
-Mama!
-Yeah.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.443
You need to take your nap.

37:26.202 --> 37:30.080
Thank fucking God.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.098
That's nice of you.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.517
Didn't want Mrs. Keene
driving through town,

39:13.601 --> 39:16.103
getting hit with sign after sign.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.273
Yeah. Did you do the same
with the signs for Ann?

39:19.357 --> 39:20.399
I did.

39:21.484 --> 39:26.071
I don't know what to do with these.
Can't bear to throw 'em away.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.241
Probably just put 'em
in my desk drawer next to Ann's.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.872
You have a nice day.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.719
God damn it!

39:54.434 --> 39:56.185
Got no comment, Miss Preaker.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.606
I just spoke with James Capisi.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.610
I'm just wondering why the police
are discounting his story.

40:04.694 --> 40:08.822
You got an eyewitness to an abduction.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.491
The eyewitness is eight.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.035
He's the kid
of a factory worker whose mama...

40:13.161 --> 40:14.995
So, that's the problem?

40:15.163 --> 40:18.248
That his mama makes minimum wage
butchering pigs for my mama?

40:20.585 --> 40:23.128
-How is your mama? She holdin' up?
-She's great.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.256
You know.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.510
So, he's not credible?
Is that what you're saying?

40:29.636 --> 40:33.180
He's got a mom with cancer,

40:33.264 --> 40:35.057
and she's a meth addict on top.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.184
-Well, I don't see how that affects...
-That boy...

40:40.230 --> 40:43.273
When he does go to school,

40:43.358 --> 40:46.151
he comes with tall tales
about where he's been.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.945
His mama took him to Disney World.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.615
She wears those hospital gowns,
white gowns.

40:51.699 --> 40:56.245
Now, he sees a woman in white
do bad things? It's a cry for help.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.998
Well, when I was a kid,
we used to scare each other

41:00.083 --> 41:04.419
with stories about a woman in white
killing little children.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.172
Yeah, I, too. Town folklore.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.466
Well, I don't know.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.051
Maybe someone doesn't
believe it's folklore.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.803
Maybe they want to make it real.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.097
Yeah, like I just said,
James Capisi...

41:15.306 --> 41:17.141
There's no woman in white,
Miss Preaker.

41:17.225 --> 41:20.102
Trust me, it's a man did this.

41:32.907 --> 41:37.286
Bobby, what the hell are you doing?
Get over here!

41:38.204 --> 41:41.498
Porch is the limit. Get over here.
Come on! Get on the damn porch!

41:41.583 --> 41:45.252
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you, son?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.984
She, you know.
She may be able to cover that up.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.155
Maker's Mark, please, double.

42:13.281 --> 42:16.783
Camille Preaker.
You beautiful girl, come say hi.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.286
Come on, Big City.
Come tell us about your adventures.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.914
-Yeah. Your exploits.
-Yeah.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.290
On the job.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.168
-No rest for the wicked?
-Nope.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.089
James Capisi's mom made a call.
Thank you.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.800
Well, I'm surprised she bothered.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.053
She didn't seem to care
that he had a gun.

42:36.137 --> 42:40.474
This fucking town.
Guns, and meth, and pigs, no offense.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.268
None taken.

42:45.355 --> 42:48.607
So, do you believe him? James?

42:48.691 --> 42:51.109
We have not eliminated
nor we have identified

42:51.194 --> 42:52.486
any theories in the Wind Gap case.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.947
Why were you taking soil
off of Bob Nash's tire today?

42:55.031 --> 42:57.908
I get it, Camille. You can't just sit
with me and have a drink. I get it.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.077
So, why don't you do me a favor
and help me with the case, okay?

43:00.161 --> 43:03.413
Educate me about Wind Gap
because I'll be honest with you,

43:03.498 --> 43:05.540
I can't quite get a handle on it.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.961
If somebody says "Bless your heart,"

43:09.045 --> 43:10.379
what they really mean is "fuck you."

43:10.505 --> 43:14.341
So I've been told by a woman
who just said, "Bless your heart."

43:14.467 --> 43:15.884
Let me guess. Jackie O'Neill?

43:16.261 --> 43:17.803
-She's a character.
-She's sweet.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.388
Only woman who was
genuinely nice to me.

43:19.472 --> 43:20.931
Come one.
Don't give me that bullshit.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.724
I heard about you,
princess of Wind Gap.

43:22.809 --> 43:26.395
-Bow down.
-I said "genuinely."

43:30.233 --> 43:32.025
So, how'd you become
a reporter, anyway?

43:32.110 --> 43:33.443
Coming from here?

43:33.528 --> 43:36.780
Well, just because it's a small town,
doesn't mean we're all rubes.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.116
Believe it or not, some of us read.
We even write.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.955
Some of us do.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.459
There you go,
from the admiring and the envious.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.295
That's what they said?

43:51.379 --> 43:53.672
I don't really feel comfortable
saying what they said.

43:53.923 --> 43:57.384
Next up,
four blowjob shots just for Camille.

43:58.803 --> 43:59.928
Assholes.

44:00.013 --> 44:02.139
Hey, where you going? Come on, Kurt.

44:05.393 --> 44:08.353
Okay, Wind Gap.
Sorry, I got sidetracked.

44:08.438 --> 44:11.565
Not really.
Those gentlemen told you a whole lot.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.359
Yeah, I want more.
I'll talk off-record.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.611
-Fine. That's fine.
-Yeah?

44:16.696 --> 44:18.739
Okay then, intrepid girl reporter.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.615
-Intrepid.
-Do your worst.

44:20.742 --> 44:23.660
Bob Nash, John Keene.
They're suspects. Why?

44:23.745 --> 44:25.704
We always look at male relatives.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.497
Nash said he was
driving home from work.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.041
Keene said he
was just driving, period.

44:29.125 --> 44:32.419
Neither can prove it.
No tolls, no E-pass,

44:32.503 --> 44:33.962
no CCTV down here,

44:34.047 --> 44:36.590
which, I have to add,
is fucking ludicrous.

44:36.674 --> 44:40.761
Vickery says the killer is a man.
Positively a man. Why positively?

44:40.845 --> 44:44.181
The statistics for one thing,

44:44.307 --> 44:46.308
and it takes a lot of strength
to pull teeth.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.101
-Says who?
-Me.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.646
I tried it.

44:51.773 --> 44:55.025
-You fucking with me?
-No, I tried it.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.360
With a giant pig's head.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.450
-You're a sick fuck.
-Bless your heart.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.578
Look. Look, now, it's right.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.583
Just don't put too many pillows.

45:11.667 --> 45:12.793
This isn't right.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.381
- This isn't right!
- We'll make it right, sweet.

45:17.507 --> 45:19.007
So senseless.

45:19.092 --> 45:20.300
Breaks your heart.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.719
Jeannie Keene's house was very nice.

45:22.804 --> 45:25.013
- A little faux bucolic.
- Marian,

45:25.139 --> 45:26.598
it all just makes me think of...

45:26.682 --> 45:29.017
But that eulogy of hers was very odd.

45:29.102 --> 45:32.104
For her to tell the world she's angry.

45:32.188 --> 45:33.480
Hi.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.483
Where were you?

45:38.277 --> 45:40.278
-Well, first I was at...
-Never mind.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.407
I don't want to know.

45:50.206 --> 45:53.333
This isn't right.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.835
This isn't right!

45:58.339 --> 46:00.715
- Hello?
- What do you got, kiddo?

46:01.050 --> 46:03.760
Well, at the church,

46:03.845 --> 46:05.470
the mourners were acting
like the funeral

46:05.555 --> 46:07.973
was the hot ticket in town.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.599
And at the house,

46:09.684 --> 46:13.186
there's a "whatever" sweatshirt
by the door.

46:13.729 --> 46:17.274
John Keene, the brother,
popular because of his girlfriend.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.276
Probably an oddball like his sister,

46:19.360 --> 46:22.988
and extremely close with his sister,
which the town finds odd.

46:23.072 --> 46:25.740
The owner of Precious Guns and Gold...

46:25.825 --> 46:27.659
I love that.

46:28.369 --> 46:33.707
Yeah, well, he says
that he's all sold out of guns.

46:33.875 --> 46:35.500
He's okay on gold.

46:35.668 --> 46:38.003
Yeah, and I have a boy who swears

46:38.087 --> 46:40.547
he saw the woman in white
take Natalie,

46:40.631 --> 46:43.049
which is just a bit
of Wind Gap folklore.

46:43.176 --> 46:44.509
Well, what else about Natalie?

46:44.927 --> 46:47.637
Basically a profile on her, you know?

46:47.722 --> 46:50.849
Nothing people go crazier for
than a murdered little girl.

46:51.017 --> 46:55.395
Well, I got a look at her room,
decorated by her mother.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.232
You can tell 'cause it's all flowery
and pink in contrast to Natalie,

46:59.400 --> 47:03.737
which was sneakers and dirty clothes

47:03.821 --> 47:07.240
and a spider that
she kept in a jar by the door.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.618
Now, that's gold.

47:09.702 --> 47:12.245
We'll have to figure out
how to use the spider.

47:12.330 --> 47:15.790
"A lover of animals, even ones
that can repel and frighten."

47:15.875 --> 47:17.542
Yeah. That's good stuff.

47:18.503 --> 47:19.961
The folks give you
permission to be in there?

47:20.046 --> 47:23.298
Otherwise, we're screwed.
Not legally, probably...

47:23.466 --> 47:25.342
But ethically.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.513
We're fine. Her mom gave me a tour.

47:29.597 --> 47:32.807
Good work, kiddo.
That's all fantastic detail.

47:32.892 --> 47:34.726
Use it.

47:34.852 --> 47:37.437
"An adventurous spirit
whose independent streak

47:37.522 --> 47:41.441
"and love of nature
may have been her undoing."

47:41.526 --> 47:44.236
-What do you think?
-It's a bit much.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.279
How many drinks in are you?

47:46.739 --> 47:48.907
Hey, kiddo, it's a week day.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.409
I'm on the wagon week days,
you know me.

47:51.494 --> 47:54.412
So, how are you holding up?
Eileen wants to know.

47:54.622 --> 47:55.956
Yeah. Um...

47:59.210 --> 48:01.419
It's a bit weird being home,

48:01.504 --> 48:06.007
but it's good to be working
on something big again.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.801
-Right.
-Yeah.

48:08.052 --> 48:10.887
-Now, you'd tell me if...
-I'm good, Curry.

48:11.013 --> 48:12.847
Let me be good.

48:12.932 --> 48:14.015
-Okay?
-Okay.

48:14.809 --> 48:18.019
You file as quick as you can.

48:18.104 --> 48:21.231
Okay. Well, don't read it till
you've had three more.

48:21.315 --> 48:24.651
You'll think it's a masterpiece. Bye.

48:24.735 --> 48:27.529
Yeah, it's, funny, funny girl.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.130
It's not right!

49:27.214 --> 49:29.633
- It has to be right!
- Amma, remember...

49:29.925 --> 49:32.093
Hey, what's going on?

49:32.219 --> 49:33.428
-Hey, Mama, what's going on?
-No!

49:33.512 --> 49:35.680
-Stop it!
-Is she all right?

49:35.765 --> 49:38.099
She's scared. She's lashing out.

49:38.225 --> 49:41.811
She just saw two
of her friends murdered.

49:43.856 --> 49:47.192
You were drunk at the Keene's house.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.819
I wasn't...

49:50.946 --> 49:52.405
But even if I was, this is Wind Gap.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.948
-Everyone's drunk.
-Camille...

49:54.033 --> 49:55.909
Now, Amma's throwing a fit,

49:55.993 --> 49:59.496
and you're giving me
a lecture about drinking?

49:59.705 --> 50:00.747
-Camille...
-You're amazing.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.290
You will always find a way to, what?

50:02.375 --> 50:03.958
-Camille, Camille...
-What? What?

50:04.043 --> 50:07.712
I just want things to be nice with us,

50:07.797 --> 50:09.964
but maybe I don't know how.

50:12.218 --> 50:16.888
Natalie reminded me of you.
Always running around in the woods.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.974
Coming home wild and filthy.

50:20.267 --> 50:23.520
I thought maybe I could help her.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.899
Since, clearly, I couldn't help you.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.529
It's okay, Mama.

50:32.613 --> 50:36.324
I think Camille could be good.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.035
Can't you, Camille?

51:00.641 --> 51:02.183
Fuck it.
