Hey, it’s Hannah. Hannah Baker.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.455
There ’5 not a simple explanation
For the things that .7 fee/

Get a snack. Settle in.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.188
Because I’m about to tell you
the story of my life.

01:07.270 --> 01:12.060
I can ’t love you
I’m too scared to

01:15.780 --> 01:21.116
It’s not a trick that’s up my sleeve
It’s just the heart inside me

What the hell are you doing?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.055
Nothing. I'm just--

01:49.650 --> 01:50.799
Looking for something?

01:52.190 --> 01:53.646
What would I be looking for?

01:56.070 --> 01:56.980
You tell me.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.361
Do you even know my name?

02:01.450 --> 02:06.285
-[scoffs] 'Course I do, Clay.
-Guys. Second bell.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.412
You're not that innocent, Jensen.
I don't give a shit what she says.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.293
Mr. Foley, let's go. Get to homeroom.

02:20.220 --> 02:21.596
You too, Mr. Jensen.

02:24.850 --> 02:28.684
[woman] 50, there are a number of ways
to get help if you need it,

02:28.770 --> 02:30.590
or if a friend does, okay?

02:30.690 --> 02:33.682
And all of this information is
on the board outside of my room

02:33.770 --> 02:35.601
or outside of the main office.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.351
It's on the Liberty High home page.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.772
Ms. Bradley, is it possible
we could be done with all this?

02:40.860 --> 02:42.111
I mean, it's been over a week.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.861
Isn't it healthy to, like, move on?

02:43.950 --> 02:45.156
[disgusted murmurs]

02:45.240 --> 02:46.696
Okay, everyone, thank you.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.655
Seriously, I know, it's tragic,

02:48.750 --> 02:50.820
but I don't want to keep being
reminded all the time.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.239
It's depressing.

02:52.330 --> 02:55.379
We're never done with it, Mr. Pratters,
which is why it's important to know

02:55.460 --> 02:58.543
the signs that someone you care for
might need help.

02:58.630 --> 03:01.588
[voice fades to echo] I mean, are they
withdrawing from friends and family?

03:01.680 --> 03:03.636
Is there a change in their appearance?

03:04.300 --> 03:05.631
Are they having trouble in...

03:05.720 --> 03:08.302
[Mrs. Bradley] The group collaboration
project is worth one-fifth

03:08.390 --> 03:11.723
-of your semester grade total, 50--
-[bell rings]

03:12.520 --> 03:15.728
Okay, so, please be committed

03:15.820 --> 03:18.311
and constant and fair to each other.

03:20.740 --> 03:21.809
I like the hair.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.230
The short hair. Um...

03:24.320 --> 03:25.617
I liked the long hair, too.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.498
And, um, I realize this makes me seem
wishy-washy,

03:28.580 --> 03:30.821
and I should have said something
the other night,

03:30.910 --> 03:36.030
and in truth I don't actually like change,
but this change seems cool.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.640
Are you with us?

03:57.480 --> 03:59.641
Yeah, no, I am, I'm with you.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.277
[Mrs. Bradley] So, between now and then,
observe yourself.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.076
Bring in information.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.413
The students did this on their own.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.786
We thought it just best to leave it.

a master key or something.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.050
Yeah, there was, once.

04:45.570 --> 04:48.528
[Mrs. Baker] She doesn't have any stickers
or pictures inside.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.031
Why doesn't she have any stickers?

-Honey, it's just a locker.
-No, it's Hannah's locker.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.109
Why is it like that?

This is everything, then?

05:07.340 --> 05:10.138
Yes. I mean, we can
go through the rest in my office.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.926
That way I can return the textbook.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.839
What the fuck are you doing?

05:57.850 --> 06:00.182
[Tyler] Nothing. Just yearbook stuff.

Get out, dude.

Hey, sorry. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

06:12.490 --> 06:13.821
Everything's fine here.

Just stay in Aspen.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.962
How are you doing, sweetie?

06:32.050 --> 06:33.597
You've been on my mind.

Hey, Courtney.

06:35.890 --> 06:36.800
I have?

06:36.890 --> 06:40.223
Well, I just feel like we all
need to be there for each other

06:40.310 --> 06:42.266
at a time like this, you know?

06:42.860 --> 06:43.679
Sure.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.770
It's all just so sad.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.522
It just doesn't make sense, right?

06:48.610 --> 06:49.440
No.

06:50.070 --> 06:51.059
But, um...

06:52.200 --> 06:53.736
a lot of things don't make sense.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.037
Exactly. So true.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.999
Some things, you know, just don't
have simple explanations, right?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.991
Right. Yeah.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.240
I'm glad we got to talk.

07:06.050 --> 07:06.869
Bye.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.369
Yeah, good talk.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.460
You want a ride home?

Yeah, sure.

07:24.770 --> 07:25.759
No bike today?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.444
Uh, no, Mom wanted to drive me,
and, you know, talk about things.

Oh.

07:36.870 --> 07:37.859
Can I play you a tape?

07:38.450 --> 07:39.439
Yeah, of course.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.320
You're still on the old media, huh?

08:06.190 --> 08:09.432
All my fa/lings exposed

08:09.530 --> 08:12.442
And there’s a taste in my mouth

08:12.530 --> 08:15.988
As desperation takes hold

08:16.070 --> 08:19.233
Is it someth/ng so good

08:19.330 --> 08:22.788
- Just can ’t function no more
-[song fades]

08:28.090 --> 08:29.079
Like so.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.757
Now, if they ask you if it's real butter,
what do you say?

08:32.590 --> 08:34.330
It's a butter-based product.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.000
And smile when you say it.

08:36.590 --> 08:39.468
I know, terrifying.
But it sells the big lie.

08:40.430 --> 08:42.637
Oh, and, uh, little trade secret:

08:43.020 --> 08:44.681
If they're cute,
only put butter on the top

08:44.770 --> 08:47.307
so they have to come back for more
during the movie.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.929
Okay, uh, why?

08:50.650 --> 08:51.730
So you can chat 'em up.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.067
Oh, chat's not really my thing.

08:56.910 --> 08:57.729
I like it.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.366
I think we're gonna get along.

09:00.450 --> 09:03.248
As long as you remember I started here
three weeks before you,

09:03.330 --> 09:06.208
so I have seniority,
which is why I'm training you.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.581
Which is insane if you think about it,

09:08.670 --> 09:10.547
because I just moved here
two months ago

09:10.630 --> 09:12.370
and I have no idea what I'm doing.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.750
I think it's going well.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.596
Do you like it?

09:19.680 --> 09:20.556
Here?

09:21.470 --> 09:24.769
At the Crestmont?
I find the various smells fascinating.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.556
No, this town.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.219
Oh, right. Uh...

09:29.230 --> 09:31.266
I don't have anything to compare it to.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.896
I've lived here all my life.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.063
It's like asking Han Solo "How is space?"

09:37.160 --> 09:40.323
Wow! You're an actual nerd, aren't you?

09:40.910 --> 09:43.287
I admire that.
There's courage in being a nerd.

[mellow jazz playing]

11:15.170 --> 11:17.081
Dad, where's your radio thing?

11:18.340 --> 11:20.251
"My radio thing"?

11:20.340 --> 11:22.467
That thing you play CDs on

11:22.550 --> 11:25.462
when you're painting
or working in the yard or whatever.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.595
My boom box.

11:27.390 --> 11:28.675
That really what they're called?

11:28.770 --> 11:31.227
They were.
I believe now they're called obsolete.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.266
Uh, yeah, it's in the workshop.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.055
It plays tapes, right?

11:35.150 --> 11:36.640
It does, last I checked.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.106
How were things at school today?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.828
Same. Everyone's still acting weird.

11:48.450 --> 11:49.280
And you?

11:50.290 --> 11:51.279
Um...

11:53.630 --> 11:54.665
How are you doing?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.912
Me? I'm... fine.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.619
I'm good.

12:05.010 --> 12:07.558
So, can I-- I can use the boom box?

12:08.850 --> 12:10.260
Yes, of course. The boom box.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.169
Go.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.971
But... keep in touch.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.390
Okay?

12:16.690 --> 12:17.725
Sure thing, Dad.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.741
Hey, it’s Hannah.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.579
Hannah Baker.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.699
Holy shit.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.588
Don ’t aoy'ust your. . .
whatever device you ’re hearing this on.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.462
It’s me, live and In stereo.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.262
No return engagements, no encore,

12:54.350 --> 12:56.978
and this time, absolutely no requests.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.896
Get a snack. Settle in.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.436
Because I'm about to tell you
the story of my life.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.362
More specifically, why my life ended.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.691
And if you ’re listening to this tape...

13:11.450 --> 13:13.077
you ’re one of the reasons why.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.201
I’m not saying which tape
brings you into the story.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.549
But fear not if you received
this lo ve/y little box,

13:20.630 --> 13:22.257
your name w/l/ pop up.

13:22.340 --> 13:23.295
I promise.

13:24.130 --> 13:27.008
Anyway, the rules here are pretty s/mp/e.

13:27.430 --> 13:29.091
- There are only two.
Whatcha doing?

13:29.180 --> 13:30.750
-Jesus!
-Sorry.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.097
What have we said
about helicopter parenting?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.420
I didn't mean to scare you.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.227
You were just lost in--
what is that you're listening to?

13:37.310 --> 13:40.689
It's, uh... it's nothing.
It's for history class.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.219
-Cassettes are history now?
-Mm-hm.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.685
Hm! Of course they are.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.769
Can I listen?

13:45.860 --> 13:47.600
No, uh, it's dumb.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.691
I'm gonna head up to my room. Homework.

13:53.910 --> 13:55.901
Clay, school emailed again today.

13:57.540 --> 14:00.031
Which explains why Dad
showed interest in my life.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.950
You two are dangerous when you coordinate.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.586
You know I hate being the kind of parent

14:03.670 --> 14:06.298
who asks if you want
to talk about anything, but...

14:06.800 --> 14:08.336
if you want to talk about anything...

14:09.260 --> 14:10.716
I didn't really know her, Mom.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.500
Didn't you two work together
at the Crestmont?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.888
-Yeah, for a little while--
-But you didn't know her very well?

14:18.480 --> 14:19.549
Not really.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.566
I need to get to work--

14:22.650 --> 14:24.641
-Shit!
-Language.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.733
I'm sorry. I gotta... I gotta go work.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.277
This thing is due in two days,
so I gotta go.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.775
Clay.

14:32.530 --> 14:33.406
Slow down, hon.

14:34.410 --> 14:35.399
It's just homework.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.912
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.749
What the hell?

14:54.350 --> 14:55.385
[grunts]

15:08.030 --> 15:08.849
Shit.

15:09.900 --> 15:10.855
[sighs]

15:21.040 --> 15:22.450
I have to go to Tony's.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.207
Hold on, Tony's? Now?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.837
He needs one of the tapes.
We're working together.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.376
Dinner's in a half hour.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.131
Make me a plate for later?

15:32.720 --> 15:35.211
Text me if you're gonna be later
than really late.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.596
-I will. Bye.
-Bye.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.327
[children chattering]

16:07.420 --> 16:08.375
[horn honking]

16:22.230 --> 16:23.436
Hand me the screwdriver.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.100
Okay.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.100
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, Clay.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.152
-Something wrong with her?
-Nothing wrong yet.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.946
It's called taking care of things.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.613
-Dad, you remember Clay.
-Yeah, sure.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.149
How you doing, Clay?

16:43.790 --> 16:45.109
I'm well, thank you.

16:45.210 --> 16:46.416
So, Clay, what's up?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.700
Nothing. I was, uh...

16:48.790 --> 16:50.121
I was out for a ride.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.586
On the other side of town?

16:53.590 --> 16:55.421
That should do it. Start her up.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.466
-Hand me the rag.
-I'll do it.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.557
If we got the timing right, we'll hear it.

17:06.230 --> 17:07.515
Okay, flip the ignition.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.641
[engine turning over]

17:11.730 --> 17:13.277
[engine revs]

17:15.820 --> 17:18.368
You hear that? That's how it should sound.

17:18.450 --> 17:21.283
-That sounds different?
-Yeah, it's different. Are you deaf?

17:21.370 --> 17:23.952
-[Tony] Sounds the same as before.
-Then you are deaf.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.747
-That's so much smoother. Night and day.
-[Tony responds indistinctly]

17:26.830 --> 17:29.333
[Tony's dad] I don't think so.
I know, and you should too.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.206
That's why I'm showing you this.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.335
Okay, shut her off.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.716
[engine shuts off]

17:38.340 --> 17:39.750
I should get out of here.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.000
-Sure you don't want to stay for dinner?
-No, thanks.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.419
My mom's making pork chops.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.387
If I'm not home soon,
she'll call the cops or something.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.141
They emailed all the parents again.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.300
-Oh, I know.
-[Tony's dad] She leave a note?

17:51.190 --> 17:52.521
Girl who killed herself?

17:53.940 --> 17:54.770
Uh...

17:55.360 --> 17:56.349
I don't know.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.946
[speaks low in Spanish]

17:59.780 --> 18:00.986
Well, you listen to me.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.072
You ever do that to your mother,
I will kill you, you understand?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.701
I'll kill you dead.

18:06.790 --> 18:07.779
Clean this shit up.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.628
No sense of irony in that comment.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.120
None. He's, uh...

18:14.210 --> 18:15.256
He's a simple man.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.159
Yep.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.421
I'll see you later.

18:18.510 --> 18:20.501
Clay, I think you got something
that belongs to me.

18:23.100 --> 18:23.919
Ido?

18:26.140 --> 18:27.175
My keys.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.346
Oh, yeah, right. Here.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.350
I'll see you later.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.616
[Hannah]
The rules here are pretty simple.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.780
There are only two.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.821
Rule number one: you listen.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.837
Number two: you pass it on.

18:53.630 --> 18:56.042
Hopeful/y, neither one wrl/ be easy.

18:56.130 --> 18:59.293
It’s not supposed to be easy,
or I would have ema/led you an MP3.

18:59.380 --> 19:02.087
When you ’re done listening
to all 1.? sides,

19:02.180 --> 19:04.808
because there are 13 sides
to every story. ..

19:05.600 --> 19:07.636
rewind the tapes,
put them back in the box,

19:07.730 --> 19:09.721
and pass them on to the next person.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.220
Why the hell am I on this?

19:11.600 --> 19:14.728
Oh, and the box of tapes
should have included a map.

19:15.650 --> 19:18.642
I’ll be mentioning several spots
around our beloved city.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.731
I can’t force you to visit them,

19:20.820 --> 19:24.529
but if you’d l/ke a little more inSIght;
head for the stars.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.288
Or, you know, just throw the map away
and I 7/ never know. . .

19:30.670 --> 19:31.705
or wﬂl I?

19:34.540 --> 19:37.338
You see, in case you ’re tempted
to break the rules,

19:37.420 --> 19:40.332
understand I did make a copy
of these tapes,

19:40.420 --> 19:42.422
and I left them with a trusted individual

19:42.510 --> 19:45.502
who, if this package doesn ’t
make it through all of you,

19:45.600 --> 19:48.012
w/l/ release those copies
in a very public manner.

19:48.890 --> 19:51.222
This was not _ _
a spur of the moment deCISIon.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.221
Do not take me for granted.

19:53.690 --> 19:54.725
Not again.

19:54.810 --> 19:55.811
I never did!

19:57.270 --> 19:59.067
-[car horn honking]
-Whoa!

19:59.150 --> 20:01.027
-[honking]
-[tires squeal]

20:02.740 --> 20:03.855
[tape player clatters]

20:05.070 --> 20:07.118
[tires squealing away]

20:08.660 --> 20:10.070
[grunts]

20:11.500 --> 20:12.785
[coughs]

20:17.250 --> 20:18.740
[panﬁng]

20:22.930 --> 20:23.749
[groans softly]

20:25.970 --> 20:27.176
Oh, shit.

20:41.150 --> 20:41.980
[grunts]

21:02.170 --> 21:03.410
[Hannah]
Do what I say.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.796
Not more, not less.

21:08.550 --> 21:09.756
You ’re being watched.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.235
Everything okay?

21:25.320 --> 21:26.776
Yeah. No, I just forgot something.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.440
What? It's nothing.

21:29.530 --> 21:31.157
Did you fall off your bike?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.868
Low-hanging branch.
I went through the woods. It was dark.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.156
I'll get the first aid kit.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.070
I don't need first aid.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.161
You are bleeding. You need ointment.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.831
Mom, please don't say "ointment."

21:44.010 --> 21:45.216
I'm fine, really.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.962
-What happened?
-I told you, bike, branch, skin.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.130
That's all?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.926
Mom, I tell you everything about my life

21:51.010 --> 21:53.012
because it is so fascinating,
I promise.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.170
I'll clean it up. I have to go.
Tony's waiting.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.089
Ah-ah.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.016
Your helmet, please.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.029
[Hannah] Love the helmet.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.285
It's adorable.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.413
You mean "adorable" in a helpless
baby animal sort of way, I'm guessing.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.250
Aren't you afraid of helmet hair?

22:26.340 --> 22:28.968
My hair does the same thing
no matter what, just sits there.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.506
You just need some product.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.886
A little effort to style it,
blow-dry it in the morning.

22:33.970 --> 22:35.926
And sacrifice my masculinity?

22:36.020 --> 22:37.840
That ship has sailed, don't you think?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.766
Forgive me for wanting to keep
my brains in my head.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.148
Instead of, say, some other regions,
like most boys?

22:46.690 --> 22:49.102
Come on, Helmet,
you've got bathrooms to clean.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.691
-You mean "we've got."
-Mm. I don't, actually.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.152
Oh, uh, party at my house
tomorrow night.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.209
You're invited. It's mandatory.
Don't bring the helmet.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.372
Cool. Where, uh... where do you live?

23:04.250 --> 23:07.504
[Hannah]
Put your ﬁnger on ”C; ”
your other finger on ”4. ”

23:08.420 --> 23:11.753
Br/ng them together.
Thatis our first red star.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.544
I know, right?

23:13.640 --> 23:16.768
A map. Old school, again.

23:16.850 --> 23:18.169
lVo Goog/e Maps,

23:18.270 --> 23:22.684
no app, no chance for the interwebs
to make everything worse, l/ke it does.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.741
[engine revs]

24:07.440 --> 24:09.146
[engine revs, tires squeal]

24:17.580 --> 24:20.743
[Hannah]
You ’ve arrived at
my first house In th/s sh/tty town.. .

24:22.250 --> 24:24.957
where I threw my first and only party. . .

24:26.540 --> 24:28.417
and where I met Justin Foley...

24:29.210 --> 24:31.007
the subject of our ﬁrst tape.

24:31.090 --> 24:33.422
[rock music plays indistinctly]

24:35.430 --> 24:36.715
It was just a party.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.638
I didn ’t know it was
the beginn/ng of the end.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.188
-[music continues]
-[overlapping chatter]

24:46.400 --> 24:50.643
Just/n, you were in love
with my friend Kat. My only friend.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.732
He came! Clay's here!

24:52.820 --> 24:55.448
-[chuckles]
-I win! You owe me five dollars.

24:55.530 --> 24:56.360
Oh, my God.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.270
-You bet on me?
-Aga|nst you.

24:58.370 --> 25:02.784
Last party I saw Clay at...
mm, my birthday, fourth grade.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.616
-I still remember that clown.
-Mm!

25:05.710 --> 25:07.530
Oh, my God. He was a heroin addict.

25:07.630 --> 25:11.748
My mother the social worker
hired a recovering heroin addict.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.250
He had the shakes.

25:13.670 --> 25:16.582
Okay, uh, drinks. Come on. Excuse me.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.427
-I just thought he was nervous.
-[both chuckle]

25:19.510 --> 25:20.499
-Hey.
-Hi, Kat.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.307
This is quite a turnout.
People are happy to see you go.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.598
I really just threw it so Hannah
could finally meet some people

25:27.690 --> 25:29.897
before I depart this realm.

25:29.980 --> 25:31.311
I met Helmet.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.231
Clay doesn't count. You met him at work.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.107
-I feel like that should count.
-Of course you do.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.522
Okay, refills. Clay, what is your drink?

25:39.620 --> 25:40.769
Uh, Sprite.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.690
Oh, my God, you are priceless.

25:42.790 --> 25:44.997
You are a gem. You'll have a beer.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.490
Sure, I like beer.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.377
-[Tyler] Kat.
-Oh. Picture.

25:50.710 --> 25:51.790
[shutter clicks]

25:55.090 --> 25:57.297
Stop having so much fun, Clay.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.460
I'm having fun, totally.

25:59.970 --> 26:00.880
Woot!

26:03.520 --> 26:04.805
You're too buttoned up.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.015
[laughing]

26:11.440 --> 26:12.259
Hey there.

26:13.030 --> 26:13.849
Hey.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.779
You're, um, you're the new girl.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.611
Apparently.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.770
Uh, I like your laugh.

26:21.870 --> 26:22.939
Thanks.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.440
I like your understated sense of fashion.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.167
[chuckles] Thanks.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.114
[Kat] Bryce.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.332
Better go hit the keg and catch up.
You're an hour behind.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.216
I'll see you later... I hope.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.369
See you.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.752
Oh, God, no. Solid no, Hannah.

26:42.850 --> 26:45.057
He is, like, frat boy Darth Vader.

26:45.140 --> 26:46.425
He didn't seem that bad.

26:47.180 --> 26:48.181
I was being kind.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.510
She kind of was.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.640
I think I want a beer too.

26:55.070 --> 26:57.061
Okay, then, Princess Leia.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.947
Oh, my God, you're both nerds.

27:00.450 --> 27:01.565
Have fun.

27:06.950 --> 27:07.860
Are you gonna tell her?

27:09.370 --> 27:10.200
Tell her what?

27:10.290 --> 27:13.202
Oh, please. I've known you
this entire century.

27:14.290 --> 27:15.917
Well, give me a break.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.251
I'm not good with the...

27:17.710 --> 27:20.679
you know,
and the gay rumors only recently subsided.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.172
Mmm. So the stakes are high for you.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.422
It's like, around her,
I can be different, you know?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.340
I'm the new and improved Clay Jensen:

27:29.430 --> 27:32.854
high school sophomore,
archaeologist-slash-adventurer.

27:34.230 --> 27:38.109
Clay, sweets, you're a prize.

27:38.190 --> 27:43.480
But from my limited observation,
she has terrible taste in guys.

27:45.870 --> 27:48.247
You won't say anything to her?

27:49.750 --> 27:50.739
Only if it comes up.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.359
Kat!

27:53.170 --> 27:54.455
[cell phone vibrating]

28:03.010 --> 28:03.829
[phone clicks]

28:16.480 --> 28:18.107
-Shit!
-Watch it!

28:19.940 --> 28:24.104
[laughing, yelling]

28:24.200 --> 28:25.815
No...

28:25.910 --> 28:26.979
[Kat] Meet the boys.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.993
Justin Foley is mine,
and Zach Dempsey for you.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.412
Zach Dempsey? Really?

28:33.500 --> 28:35.161
What? Zach's sweet?

28:36.250 --> 28:37.706
I can't see!

28:37.790 --> 28:38.620
Not the mane!

28:39.420 --> 28:41.832
Okay, yeah, he's kind of dumb,

28:41.920 --> 28:44.832
but he's the sweet kind of dumb,
which is the best kind.

28:48.180 --> 28:49.420
Yes.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.843
Liberty High's star athletes,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.726
So impressive.

28:54.810 --> 28:57.688
Sorry, boys. Can't have you
in Hannah's house soaking wet.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.180
Seriously?

28:59.270 --> 29:00.851
Oh, my God, look at yourselves.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.520
Better?

29:03.610 --> 29:07.569
Improvement, for sure,
but sorry, it's still a no-go.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.070
Come on! It's not a party without us.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.320
[Kat] We'll take our chances.

29:10.410 --> 29:11.695
Go dry off.

29:11.790 --> 29:13.326
Your loss, milady.

29:13.910 --> 29:15.787
Idiots. I can't even...

29:16.040 --> 29:17.280
But they're sweet idiots.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.713
[Hannah]
So, you see,
that’s where the trouble began.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.131
That sm/le.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.175
That damned sm/le.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.221
The one and only Kat moved away
before the start of school.

29:41.150 --> 29:44.062
She was the kind of friend
that cou/dn ’t be replaced

29:44.150 --> 29:47.062
even by falling in love
with the boy she left beh/nd.

29:49.030 --> 29:49.860
[Justin] Hey.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.242
-Hannah, right?
-Right.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.321
Justin. Foley.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.490
I saw you at the party the other night.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.207
Yeah, I saw you too.

30:01.710 --> 30:02.699
You're drier now.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.468
Yeah, well, we went home and changed.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.289
Was it profound?

30:08.090 --> 30:08.920
Huh?

30:09.010 --> 30:09.840
Your change.

30:10.430 --> 30:12.386
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.220
So, uh...

30:16.310 --> 30:17.436
Kat's gone.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.726
Yeah. Sucks.

30:21.940 --> 30:22.895
You talk to her?

30:22.980 --> 30:26.143
Yeah. I mean, you know, like, a little.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.059
Yeah, me too.

30:28.610 --> 30:29.440
A little.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.150
I, uh, should get to class.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.650
Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally. [chuckles]

30:37.750 --> 30:39.536
So, I'll see you around, then.

30:40.580 --> 30:41.535
I guess you will.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.259
Being Kat’s boyfriend was k/nd of
the only remarkable thing about you,

30:47.340 --> 30:50.082
but; Justin, you were my Krypton/te.

30:50.590 --> 30:51.545
Zach who?

30:52.010 --> 30:52.999
[Hannah] Dempsey.

30:53.470 --> 30:54.880
0h!

30:54.970 --> 30:55.959
Sorry, love.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.096
I ’rn learning all these new boy names,

30:58.190 --> 31:01.728
and I ’ve dragged most of the old ones
into the Trash icon in my head.

31:01.810 --> 31:02.765
[chuckles] Yeah.

31:03.770 --> 31:07.354
So, anyway, I know you wanted me
to hook up with Zach, but--

31:07.440 --> 31:10.193
But... you’re into Justin.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.019
I'm evil.

31:12.120 --> 31:12.939
lVo.

31:13.030 --> 31:16.193
Hard/y. He’s... jock crack.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.457
I get it. Heis all yours.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.576
No, I would never--

31:20.670 --> 31:24.208
Seriously, I have moved on,
times 2, 000 m/les,

31:24.290 --> 31:26.372
and I ’m dating h/psters now.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.087
He’s all yours.

31:30.090 --> 31:32.081
[Hannah]
I was an office assistant thr'rd period.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.382
So I knew where you were third period.

31:40.940 --> 31:45.149
[male teacher] All right, so that's just
the even numbers one through 40.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.777
You've got to show your work.

31:46.860 --> 31:49.772
Yeah, you heard me say it:
Show your work.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.908
-[bell rings]
-All right, dismissed. Thank you.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.110
[students chattering]

31:59.040 --> 31:59.859
VVhoa!

31:59.960 --> 32:01.200
Careful, there.

32:01.290 --> 32:02.575
I'm sorry about that.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.207
Geometry with Bates.
No wonder you're in a hurry.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.451
-Oh, you have him, too?
-Fifth period.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.666
-The worst ten hours of my day.
-[chuckles]

32:09.760 --> 32:11.921
Speaking of, gotta go.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.637
[stammers] Oh, yeah, great. Um...

32:13.720 --> 32:14.755
I'll see you later?

32:14.850 --> 32:15.885
[Hannah] You will!

32:20.430 --> 32:23.092
I even decided to l/ke basketball
for you, Justin.

32:23.190 --> 32:24.259
[coach] Good job.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.146
There you go.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.349
Jensen!

32:29.440 --> 32:30.680
Clay Jensen!

32:31.400 --> 32:33.027
[coach] There you go. Move your feet!

32:33.110 --> 32:34.236
Helmet!

32:36.240 --> 32:37.070
Oh, hey.

32:39.080 --> 32:39.899
Sorry.

32:40.830 --> 32:41.649
Through here.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.037
Did you get lost on your way
to the library?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.370
Oh, uh...

32:46.460 --> 32:49.588
Coach Patrick assigned the game
for history homework, so...

32:50.460 --> 32:51.916
So, sit.

32:52.630 --> 32:53.836
Uh, yeah. Okay.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.882
You always stand and fidget.
It makes me anxious.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.039
[coach] Run it again!

32:59.220 --> 33:00.960
-Tootsie Roll?
-[chuckles]

33:01.520 --> 33:02.976
How can you eat those?

33:03.060 --> 33:04.846
Seriously, what does that
look like to you?

33:06.810 --> 33:08.892
Like all that's good
and sweet in the world.

33:12.030 --> 33:13.895
-Mm.
-[chuckles]

33:15.700 --> 33:17.486
I didn't figure you for a sports person.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.191
I want to get the complete
high school experience.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.327
-[buzzer sounds]
-[cheering]

33:33.920 --> 33:36.673
Justin is the complete
high school experience?

33:36.760 --> 33:37.579
Shut up!

33:40.970 --> 33:42.130
Don't be jealous, Clay.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.841
You'll fill out. Someday.

33:45.730 --> 33:46.549
Maybe.

33:47.730 --> 33:49.550
Is your dad also thin and nervous?

33:52.940 --> 33:54.487
Yeah, pretty much.

33:54.570 --> 33:55.855
-[both chuckle]
-[whistle blows]

33:57.740 --> 33:59.446
Whoo!

33:59.530 --> 34:00.770
Yeah!

34:01.370 --> 34:02.189
Yeah.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.741
-Hey, Helmet.
-Hey.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.546
Can you email me your French notes?

34:12.630 --> 34:15.667
I can't understand Madam Steinberg.
It's like she's speaking German.

34:16.550 --> 34:17.369
Sure.

34:17.970 --> 34:18.789
Ride home?

34:20.100 --> 34:22.421
Thanks, but no. My chariot awaits.

34:22.510 --> 34:24.341
Bye, Clay. See you, Justin.

34:32.940 --> 34:33.770
You guys go.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.066
Whoa! No way! The bus?

34:38.150 --> 34:40.562
Yo, bus with hot girl, car with idiots?

34:47.410 --> 34:49.867
Hey, is that seat taken?

34:49.960 --> 34:51.416
You don't take the bus.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.913
I don't? Well, then,
I guess it's your lucky day.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.340
You clearly don't lack confidence.

35:03.430 --> 35:06.593
You clearly don't have geometry
with Mr. Bates fifth period.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.477
You did research.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.379
No.

35:10.350 --> 35:12.181
Yes, I mean...

35:12.270 --> 35:13.510
I don't know, maybe.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.764
I like it.

35:15.230 --> 35:16.310
It shows initiative.

35:17.400 --> 35:21.063
So, could I like maybe
get your number or something?

35:21.820 --> 35:22.696
Or something?

35:23.410 --> 35:24.866
So, I could give you my number

35:24.950 --> 35:27.248
or give you some
fake nuclear launch codes?

35:27.330 --> 35:28.740
I'll just take your number.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.616
-I'll just take your phone.
-Huh?

35:31.250 --> 35:33.582
One, you give me your phone,
two, I put my number into it--

35:33.670 --> 35:35.046
Okay, right, right, right.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.131
-[engine starts]
-No excuses now.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.636
I'll be right back.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.926
Where are you going?

35:48.020 --> 35:49.510
Forgot my geometry book.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.477
Wait, I've got mine in here if you need--

35:52.900 --> 35:53.719
Shit.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.647
Hey, where the hell is this thing going?

35:59.740 --> 36:01.981
No clue. I don't take the bus either.

36:02.070 --> 36:04.903
Seriously? Hannah Baker!

36:04.990 --> 36:05.820
Call me!

36:06.870 --> 36:07.689
Handsome.

36:07.790 --> 36:11.453
["Cool Blue" playing]

36:13.000 --> 36:16.413
How can you wait
In the wash of the rain?

36:16.500 --> 36:18.707
-[cell phone chimes]
- You ’re soaked to your feet

36:18.800 --> 36:22.543
St/ll, you said you’d wait for me

36:26.890 --> 36:30.769
And these days, they grow so old

36:31.690 --> 36:33.931
And I 7/ never show

36:35.730 --> 36:38.221
I thought they knew

36:39.860 --> 36:44.194
I ’rn ﬁckle and slow, and I 7/ never do

36:47.700 --> 36:48.906
[Mrs. Baker] Hannah.

36:48.990 --> 36:51.197
I don't want you on the phone
when there's homework.

36:51.290 --> 36:53.110
I'm just using the calculator.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.245
[cell phone message alert]

36:54.330 --> 36:56.036
And helping a friend with homework.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.199
Phone.

36:57.290 --> 36:58.120
Phone!

36:59.380 --> 37:01.792
-Do I know this friend?
-Do you know any of them?

37:01.880 --> 37:03.427
[cell phone vibrating]

37:03.510 --> 37:04.670
More homework?

37:04.760 --> 37:06.466
We're just working on this math problem.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.846
Hello, Justin.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.557
Hannah's doing her homework.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.880
[Justin]
0h, h/, Mrs. Baker.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.141
Yeah, she was totally just
helping me with it.

37:15.230 --> 37:17.858
Oh, really? What are you working on?

37:17.940 --> 37:19.350
Uh, math.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.852
Math. Oh.

37:22.940 --> 37:23.850
All right, then.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.156
Let me know if you need my help.

37:44.380 --> 37:47.213
So, you needed help with a math problem?

37:48.180 --> 37:50.421
No. I just said that to get you alone
on the phone.

37:50.510 --> 37:52.466
Because I've got homework of my own,

37:52.560 --> 37:55.097
and I can't just talk on the phone
all afternoon.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.476
Okay, I can call you back.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.390
NO! I--

37:59.440 --> 38:04.355
I mean, uh, what problem
were you having trouble with?

38:04.860 --> 38:07.658
The one about the, uh... trains?

38:08.570 --> 38:09.616
The trains?

38:10.620 --> 38:14.533
Two trains leave at different times,
but when do they meet?

38:16.370 --> 38:17.746
0h!
[chuckles]

38:17.830 --> 38:19.661
I get it. Um...

38:19.750 --> 38:23.208
Train ’54 ” is leaving my house
in a few minutes.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.507
Train ”B” is leaving your house...

38:27.550 --> 38:29.541
In 30 minutes.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.961
Thirty minutes seems l/ke
an awfully long time

38:32.060 --> 38:33.880
for two trains going full speed huh?

38:35.930 --> 38:37.136
[chuckles]

38:38.020 --> 38:40.227
Eisenhower Park. Rocket slide.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.311
Oh, my God. [laughs]

38:46.490 --> 38:48.026
I know what you're all thinking.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.315
Hannah Baker is a slut.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.781
Oops. Did you catch that?

38:54.830 --> 38:56.741
I just said "Hannah Baker is."

38:57.960 --> 38:59.166
Can't say that anymore.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.456
[laughter]

39:05.460 --> 39:07.007
Just wait, I'm gonna get you.

39:07.090 --> 39:07.966
[shouts]

39:08.050 --> 39:10.678
[Hannah]
I dreamed our ﬁrst kiss
would take place In the park.

39:11.850 --> 39:12.965
I never told you that.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.142
The dream starts with me
at the top of the rocket...

39:21.770 --> 39:23.180
holding on to the steering wheel.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.600
It’s st/l/ a playground rocket;

39:25.690 --> 39:28.739
but every t/me I turn the wheel
to the left or the r/ght;

39:28.820 --> 39:31.106
the trees lift up
l/ke they’re taking ﬁ/ght.

39:35.490 --> 39:37.401
[both laughing]

39:37.910 --> 39:39.616
-How was that?
-That was pretty good.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.029
-Yeah, you liked it?
-Yeah.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.496
[Justin] All right, your turn.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.410
-[Hannah] My turn?
-Yeah.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.877
Okay. What are you doing?

39:45.960 --> 39:47.837
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I have to get this.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.548
-I'm wearing a skirt. Hang on, hang on.
-[mocking] I'm wearing a skirt!

39:50.630 --> 39:51.790
I got this. Let me just...

39:51.890 --> 39:55.348
And I ’m scared. . .
because I don ’t know how to ﬂy.

39:56.430 --> 39:59.558
But you ’re there at the bottom
of the slide to catch me when I fall.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.688
Okay, okay. One, two, three.

40:02.770 --> 40:05.318
-Ah! [giggles]
-[phone camera clicks]

40:05.940 --> 40:07.146
-You good?
-Yeah.

40:09.650 --> 40:11.140
And that’s all that happened.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.059
We kissed.

40:23.000 --> 40:23.819
Why?

40:25.170 --> 40:26.580
Did you hear something else?

40:43.350 --> 40:45.477
[heavy breathing]

40:48.690 --> 40:49.600
Nope.

40:49.940 --> 40:51.271
We just kissed.

40:52.610 --> 40:57.195
Sorry to disappomt you,
but I guess now we ’re even. Sort of

40:57.280 --> 40:58.941

-[car door opens, shuts]

41:12.590 --> 41:13.409
Hey, Clay.

41:14.590 --> 41:16.000
Hey, Tony.

41:17.010 --> 41:17.965
You okay?

41:19.100 --> 41:20.169
Yeah, fine.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.181
Is that my Walkman?

41:26.560 --> 41:27.470
Uh...

41:29.570 --> 41:30.889
Yeah, I was gonna ask--

41:30.980 --> 41:32.277
It's no sweat.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.106
Just be careful listening
while you ride, though.

41:35.610 --> 41:38.022
You don't want to hurt yourself. Again.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.485
You're right. Thanks.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.417
Eisenhower Park.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.951
That must mean you're about ready
for side two.

41:52.590 --> 41:55.047
Night, Clay. Take care of yourself.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.262
[Hannah]
See, I ’ve heard so many stories
about me now

42:04.350 --> 42:06.762
that I don ’t know which one
/S the most popular.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.261
But I do know which is the least popular.

42:12.860 --> 42:13.849
The truth.

42:16.450 --> 42:19.817
See, the truth isn’t always
the most exciting version of things,

42:19.910 --> 42:21.525
or the best or the worst.

42:22.450 --> 42:23.860
It’s somewhere in between.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.418
But it deserves to be heard
and remembered.

42:29.830 --> 42:32.378
The truth wﬁ/ out;
l/ke someone said once.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.909
It remains.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.960

42:51.690 --> 42:54.477
-[mellow music plays]
-So, thank you, Justin.

42:55.110 --> 42:59.069
Sincere/y. My very ﬁrst kiss
was wonden‘ul.

43:24.010 --> 43:25.716
Porter wants to see me about Hannah.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.300
Probably about this fucking lawsuit.

43:34.020 --> 43:36.022
Did you get to first base, Justin?

43:36.110 --> 43:37.850
Get off me, I'm not saying anything.

43:37.940 --> 43:39.441
-Second?
-Fuck off.

43:40.740 --> 43:41.559
Third?

43:42.120 --> 43:43.269
Okay, assholes.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.692
-A picture's worth a thousand words.
-[chuckling]

43:46.790 --> 43:48.610

43:49.910 --> 43:51.207
That's hot.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.457
Oh, yeah. We're sending that shit around.

43:54.540 --> 43:56.542
No, Bryce, stop!

43:56.630 --> 43:59.542
-[laughs]
-Hey, Bryce, stop! Hey!

43:59.630 --> 44:01.211
Bryce, come on, man!

[boys laughing, chattering]

44:06.350 --> 44:08.420
[bell rings]

44:16.610 --> 44:18.430
-You gonna hit that again, right?
-Sure.

44:18.530 --> 44:21.021
[cell phones chiming, buzzing]

44:24.570 --> 44:26.777
Oh, my God. Seriously, Justin?

44:27.660 --> 44:29.287
Why would you send that?

44:33.080 --> 44:34.240

[Mrs. Bradley]
Okay, everyone, settle in.

44:40.510 --> 44:42.501
-[cell phone chimes]
-Today we're discussing ways

44:42.590 --> 44:45.718
to navigate difficult interactions.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.712
-[cell phones continue]
-People, at least a nod in the direction

44:48.810 --> 44:51.176
of our No Devices rule. Okay?

44:51.270 --> 44:55.309
We are talking about ways to address
conflicts with your peers, all right?

44:55.400 --> 44:59.848
How can we communicate more effectively
without the use of emojis?

45:00.440 --> 45:04.353
All right, I need two volunteers
for a little roleplaying exercise.

45:04.450 --> 45:06.315
-[cell phones continue]
-People, phones,

45:06.410 --> 45:07.650
-otherwise they're going away.
-[vibrating]

45:07.740 --> 45:09.287
Last chance.

45:09.370 --> 45:10.359
Yes, Sherri.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.156
Thank you.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.820
And who else?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.569
You in the back? Yes.

45:15.670 --> 45:19.242
And Mr. Johansen. You'll be my volunteers.

45:19.340 --> 45:22.332
I'll get the scripts. Sit tight.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.081
Everybody's gonna get a turn.

45:25.010 --> 45:26.887
[Hannah]
What came after my ﬁrst kiss?

45:27.350 --> 45:28.294
Not so wonderful.

45:32.020 --> 45:33.590
[Mrs. Bradley]
We'll continue our discussion

45:33.680 --> 45:35.728
of nonverbal signals tomorrow.

45:36.850 --> 45:40.263
So, until then, make note, be aware.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.647
[Hannah]
I ’rn not angry you betrayed me.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.447
I ’rn angry that I trusted you
in the ﬁrst place.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.228
What the hell, Tony?

45:51.330 --> 45:52.866
Hey, Clay.

45:52.950 --> 45:53.951
What's the deal?

45:54.040 --> 45:55.610
How do you fit into all of this?

45:55.710 --> 45:57.666
I'm not on the tapes,
if that's what you're asking.

45:57.750 --> 45:58.990
Did you help her do it?

45:59.710 --> 46:01.041
No, I did not.

46:01.130 --> 46:02.540
-Did you know she was going to?
-No.

46:02.630 --> 46:05.588
-Then how the hell--
-Listen to the tapes, Clay.

46:06.470 --> 46:07.880
Is that all I'm gonna get?

46:09.010 --> 46:10.637
Hannah wanted it done like this.

46:10.720 --> 46:11.550
How do you know?

46:11.640 --> 46:14.382
I can't tell you that. You have to listen.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.515
What if I don't?

46:18.230 --> 46:19.299
What if I can't?

46:21.150 --> 46:23.778
Then it will only get worse. Trust me.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.692
Worse than Hannah being dead?

46:28.820 --> 46:30.117
I'll see you around, Clay.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.155
Tony.

46:36.750 --> 46:37.956
Am I side two?

46:52.010 --> 46:53.307
[Hannah] Hey, Helmet.

46:55.220 --> 46:56.471
Can I eat with you?

46:57.850 --> 47:00.728
Uh, I've got geometry homework.

47:01.270 --> 47:02.225
I don't mind.

47:07.450 --> 47:12.069
So, communications class. Really?

47:12.870 --> 47:16.078
Mrs. Bradley doesn't have a clue
what it was like to be our age.

47:16.620 --> 47:19.032
"I find it best to confront
the issue head-on by saying,

47:19.120 --> 47:21.532
'Pardon me,
but you really hurt my feelings."'

47:22.080 --> 47:23.741
I thought she had some good ideas.

47:26.010 --> 47:29.002
Have you ever in your life been
able to confront an issue head-on?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.887
Have you ever even had an issue?

47:34.560 --> 47:35.379
Yeah.

47:37.270 --> 47:38.669
Kind of. Or...

47:40.440 --> 47:42.977
I guess being socially awkward
has its advantages.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.061
I don't think you're socially awkward
at all.

47:47.150 --> 47:48.856
I think you're just scared.

47:49.650 --> 47:50.810
I think you're waiting.

47:51.780 --> 47:53.520
Well, sometimes it's better to wait.

47:56.740 --> 47:57.786
Wow. [chuckles]

47:58.790 --> 48:00.109
Okay, meaning what?

48:01.830 --> 48:03.320
Just that, um...

48:04.790 --> 48:06.417
Nothing. I mean...

48:10.800 --> 48:15.635
Pardon me,
but you really hurt my feelings.

48:20.390 --> 48:21.379
Hannah.

48:23.850 --> 48:24.680
Hannah.

48:28.570 --> 48:30.435
A rumor based on a kiss

48:30.860 --> 48:33.192
ru/ned a memory that I hoped
would be special.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.942
In fact; it ruined
just about everything. . .

I know you probably o’r'dn ’t
mean to let me down.

48:54.680 --> 48:59.424
In fact; most of you listening probably
had no idea what you were truly doing,

50:57.720 --> 51:01.042
And resentment rides high
