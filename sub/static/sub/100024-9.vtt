Baby J?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.085
Oh, hey, Momma.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.043
Why you out here
talking to yourself?

15:14.087 --> 15:16.741
I'm not talking to myself,
I'm talking to Quita.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.482
Quita?

15:18.526 --> 15:19.875
Yeah, she a good listener.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
She lost her own
brother to the gang.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.142
What's up?

15:29.363 --> 15:31.017
Get our stuff, we leaving.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.200
How the fuck you let an
11-year-old die on your watch?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.157
That shit wasn't my fault.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.637
Whose then?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.117
Don't know,
I got swept up, remember?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.422
Look.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.947
Are you in charge
out there or not?

15:47.990 --> 15:50.906
-Yeah, I'm in charge.
-Then act like it, neph!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.995
If shit goes south,
it's your fault.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.259
If an 11-year-old boy dies,
it's your fault.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.131
Swept up or not.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.047
Oh.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.313
Any of your shit finding
its way back to us?

16:06.356 --> 16:07.488
No.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.185
Dai saw to it.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.057
Handled that shit like a boss.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.972
Picked it right up.

16:14.190 --> 16:17.150
You need to be kissing
the ground that nigga walk on.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.021
Sit down.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.940
I got a wad of cash burning
a hole in my pocket.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.812
Heavier than usual.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.557
You wanna tell me why?

16:34.471 --> 16:35.995
Business been good.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.999
Okay, what is up with you two?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.436
Felt it as soon as
Teo walked in here.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.049
[door knocking]

16:47.093 --> 16:48.137
Who's that now?

16:56.841 --> 17:00.019
[Angie] Hey, get in here,
it's pouring out there.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.848
Teo didn't tell
me you were coming.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.546
Better start praying.

17:11.378 --> 17:14.207
[Angie] Look who's joining us.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.036
Well, go on,
you have room for one more?

17:24.391 --> 17:27.133
[wind howling]

17:31.746 --> 17:34.096
Are we there yet?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.097
Not yet.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.273
Still don't know
why we had to leave.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.755
Can't you see Momma's
trying to rest?

17:40.798 --> 17:42.409
Momma's still
sitting right here.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.454
She don't need
you talking for her.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.239
Yeah, Dai.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.632
[Gloria] That goes
for you too, sir.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.721
I know you hurting over
losing your friend,

17:50.765 --> 17:53.159
but you still gotta
keep your manners.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.161
Yes, Momma.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.337
And I'm still the adult here,

17:57.380 --> 18:01.167
capable of taking care of
myself and the two of you, okay?

18:01.993 --> 18:03.212
Okay.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.610
I can't even remember
the last time we saw--

18:09.653 --> 18:11.960
Yeah, she looking
forward to it too.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.972
I think my chances of getting
into Hurston are good.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.976
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.934
Your teacher give you
that recommendation?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.807
As soon as we get
back into school.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.115
She sure is taking
her sweet time.

18:38.378 --> 18:41.163
She's been a little
distracted lately.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.646
Wait, they still
haven't found Seren?

18:47.909 --> 18:50.172
Oh, God, Dai,
I completely forgot.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.609
His momma must be going crazy.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.482
And you don't know nothing?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.574
I don't know where he is.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.669
Well, I pray for him.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.549
[Gloria] Come on, boy, hurry up!

19:19.593 --> 19:21.856
[David] Move, JG!

19:26.469 --> 19:28.297
[doorbell ringing]

19:29.472 --> 19:30.952
Why y'all out front?

19:30.995 --> 19:32.736
You know everybody
come through the side.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.173
I thought you was the police.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.262
-Grandma.
-Oh, hey, baby, you wet.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.524
Come on in.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.960
-Hey, Grandma.
-Hey, David.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.310
Put them bags back
there in the back.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.054
Hey, Ma.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.404
So you just gonna
stand there all day?

19:48.448 --> 19:51.755
Catch the storm if you want,
be my guest.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.894
Boy, you trying to
run my electric up?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.287
I'm hungry.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.027
Your momma didn't feed you?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.246
[JG] No.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.075
Of course I did, JG,
why you telling stories?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
I feed my...

20:11.384 --> 20:12.472
You know what?

20:12.515 --> 20:14.256
Mrs. Cletus say
I'm being emotional

20:14.300 --> 20:16.650
because of Willie Derrick.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.913
Gloria, what is
he talking about?

20:19.914 --> 20:23.570
Just a kid from
The 'Ville who died.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.615
Just a kid from
The 'Ville who died.

20:25.659 --> 20:29.402
What kind of environment are
you raising them in, Gloria?

20:29.445 --> 20:30.490
One I can afford.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.622
My children are fine.

20:32.666 --> 20:36.278
Well, if you brought 'em by
more often, I would know that.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.932
[thunder rumbles]

20:52.425 --> 20:54.862
[wind howling]

21:00.389 --> 21:03.218
They're opening up a new
wing down at the clinic.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.351
It should be open
in two years' time.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.091
Oncology.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.094
That still in your
district, Teo?

21:11.618 --> 21:14.055
[Teo] Mm-hmm.

21:14.098 --> 21:18.320
This plantain is
delicious, Angie.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.585
Mofongo.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.414
[Angie] Thank you, there's
plenty more on the stove.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.025
Tastes just like home.

21:28.069 --> 21:30.332
Since when do
Jamaicans eat mofongo?

21:32.203 --> 21:35.337
Taste like home cooking.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.513
That's because it is
home-cooked at my home.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.123
Why aren't you at your home?

21:39.167 --> 21:41.169
Hey, hey, watch your mouth,
'brino.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.475
Fuck is your problem, man?

21:42.518 --> 21:45.434
Teo, not at the dinner table.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.699
The wife took the
kids to New York

21:49.743 --> 21:51.135
and get out of the storm.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.399
Go spend some time
with their family.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.706
[thunder rumbles]

21:56.750 --> 21:58.752
You married?

21:59.492 --> 22:00.493
Well, ex.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.190
Two kids.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.498
So, why you ain't go with them?

22:05.541 --> 22:07.151
Raynan!

22:07.195 --> 22:09.415
It's okay. Figured this
would be a good time

22:09.458 --> 22:11.460
to get some breathing room.

22:11.504 --> 22:12.896
You know, stay here.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.508
Plus, your uncle invited
me to have a nice meal

22:15.551 --> 22:18.162
with some family.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.817
Mm, sounds like a
deadbeat dad to me.

22:27.563 --> 22:30.523
Quick enough to stay
alive for my kids though.

22:31.654 --> 22:32.568
Yo, shut the fuck up!

22:32.612 --> 22:34.309
[Angie] Raynan, por favor.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.484
Hey, it's not your fault
you ain't got no daddy.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.051
Hey, watch your mouth, man.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.618
Maybe I can play daddy now.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.271
Go on, ask your mommy.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.839
Hey, stop it. Stop it!

22:42.883 --> 22:44.624
[screaming]

22:44.667 --> 22:47.104
Hey, boy, you think you're
man enough to come test me?

22:47.148 --> 22:50.151
You don't think me won't murder
you in front of your mother?

22:50.543 --> 22:52.588
Let's go.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.417
Hey, boss, no need for
all the flashy jewelry.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.114
Now, you know your
nephew had no business--

22:57.158 --> 22:59.073
No, he didn't.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.380
Okay?
And I'll deal with him.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.992
But you don't put your hands
on him in his mother's house.

23:05.035 --> 23:09.126
Plus, you ruined my
sister's nice meal.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.607
So I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

23:12.695 --> 23:16.090
Angie, give this
man an umbrella.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.397
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
[wind howling]

23:32.715 --> 23:34.456
Thank you for dinner.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.284
Sorry for the mess.

23:43.378 --> 23:46.425
You, make sure you
clean this shit up.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.558
Come on.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.432
Come on.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.092
Another inch and it would
have been your eyeball.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.966
[scoffs] If a bitch had balls,
she'd be my dog.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.098
You're lucky you're
already hurt.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.578
Fuck's the matter with you?

24:09.622 --> 24:11.624
It's like you wanna get
your face smashed in.

24:16.542 --> 24:20.633
You don't have to be a tough
guy all the time, you know?

24:20.676 --> 24:23.549
Your dad was a tough guy
and look where that got him.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.377
He died, but he died on top.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.206
The hood respects Sky.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.167
They still scared of him.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.431
They still love him.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.305
That's what he left me.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.484
That's my legacy.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.313
He never wanted this for you.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.490
Neither did I.

24:55.232 --> 24:58.497
You are so smart, you know?

24:59.802 --> 25:00.760
You can...

25:00.803 --> 25:02.631
well, you can do anything.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.506
He would want you
to be better than this.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.422
He would want you
to be better than he was.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.339
Than we was.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.994
We?

25:19.126 --> 25:21.345
You was never in the game, Ma.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.173
How you think we met?

25:23.217 --> 25:25.741
I just decided
to deal over the counter.

25:27.613 --> 25:31.312
But we both didn't want you
nowhere near this life though.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.363
I miss him.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.628
I know, baby.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.587
I miss him too.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.676
[door knocking]

25:48.634 --> 25:50.940
[Teo] Raynan, we need to talk.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.421
Get your black ass out
here ahora.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.427
Hey.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.603
Be brave.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.131
[thunder claps]

26:09.959 --> 26:11.657
I ain't gonna hurt you.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.357
'Cause it'll break
my sister's heart.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.795
I couldn't do that to her.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.755
Or me.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.061
And we've all we got.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.499
But make no mistake,

26:28.543 --> 26:31.154
if I find out that
you've been stealing

26:31.198 --> 26:35.637
or assisting in theft or
cooperating in any way,

26:35.681 --> 26:37.770
I will joyfully make
your life a living hell

26:37.813 --> 26:40.424
for as long as
my lungs draw breath.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.777
Is that clear?

26:44.820 --> 26:47.562
-Yes.
-Good. Speak.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.609
Okay, first of all,
Unc, you gotta know

26:50.652 --> 26:53.786
that I would never
lie to you, okay?

26:53.829 --> 26:58.791
Right, so I ain't got no idea
how you been coming up short.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.184
'Cause ever since
we went wholesale,
the scripts been smooth,

27:01.228 --> 27:03.056
-I mean--
-Whoa, what scripts?

27:04.013 --> 27:05.667
The prescriptions.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.364
Say more.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.845
Well, a few weeks with
a boosted prescription pad

27:09.889 --> 27:11.542
started a new operation

27:11.586 --> 27:13.457
to get supplies straight
from the pharmacy.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.024
No more one-offs.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.637
So like, we been copping
Oxy, Vic, Xany, like, whatever.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.552
Shit been hand over fist,
straight up.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.989
I thought we was
all eating good.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.512
Thought?

27:25.687 --> 27:27.646
I handed the money to Des.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.824
He come back the
next week grinning.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.739
I thought shit was smooth.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.089
[tense music playing]

27:47.143 --> 27:48.667
[gun clicks]

28:19.393 --> 28:21.395
It be our own niggas.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.923
[chuckles]

28:32.232 --> 28:34.625
[wind howling]

28:38.020 --> 28:39.805
[thunder claps]

28:42.111 --> 28:43.896
And this here's
your uncle, Butch.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.898
He was in Vietnam.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.334
[David] Whoa.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.686
Who's this?

28:58.388 --> 28:59.999
Where did you get this?

29:00.042 --> 29:01.522
And why do you have it?

29:01.565 --> 29:04.917
This is Darius,
whatever happened to him?

29:04.960 --> 29:07.702
I haven't talked to him since
he left me on his porch.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.792
-Have you?
-Well, if I recall,
you left him.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.577
When did I leave?

29:13.621 --> 29:14.796
Exactly.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.538
He denied his son.
The man was married.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.671
Oh, he was just being a man.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.840

30:21.645 --> 30:25.780

he told me to say?

30:25.824 --> 30:29.131
You can lie to yourself
and you can lie to me,

I yelled as loud as I could.

been different,
