00:54.389 --> 00:55.765
Duncan?

00:59.102 --> 01:00.311
Duncan?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.482
Duncan, are you sleeping?

01:07.360 --> 01:08.695
No.

01:12.574 --> 01:14.284
Let me ask you something.

01:16.786 --> 01:20.456
On a scale of one to ten,
what do you think you are?

01:28.214 --> 01:30.967
Duncan? I'm asking you
how you see yourself.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.760
Scale of one to ten.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.471
I don't know.

01:37.223 --> 01:39.726
I can't hear you, bud.
You have to speak up.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.269
I don't know.

01:41.436 --> 01:44.188
What? What don't you know?
How you see yourself?

01:44.439 --> 01:46.232
You don't have any opinion?

01:52.322 --> 01:53.656
I'm just asking.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.579
Pick any number,
scale of one to ten.

01:59.746 --> 02:02.457
Just shout it out.
Say a number.

02:05.835 --> 02:06.878
A six.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.503
A what?

02:09.172 --> 02:10.506
A Six!

02:12.508 --> 02:14.510
I think you're a three.

02:16.888 --> 02:18.848
You know why
I think you're a three?

02:18.931 --> 02:21.309
Do you know what would
make me say that?

02:21.684 --> 02:22.727
No.

02:23.645 --> 02:25.730
You don't know?
You have no idea?

02:26.064 --> 02:27.148
No.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.775
You've got to speak up, buddy.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.068
No!

02:31.444 --> 02:33.154
Since I've been
dating your mom,

02:33.237 --> 02:35.865
I don't see you putting
yourself out there, bud.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.659
Meeting kids your own age.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.327
And from what
your mom tells me,

02:39.410 --> 02:42.246
you just seem content
to hang around her apartment.

02:42.747 --> 02:46.084
Is that a fair assessment? You're
just happy to not do anything?

02:47.126 --> 02:51.130
Because, damn,
to me that is a three.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.968
But, the good news
I'm here to tell you,

02:56.135 --> 02:58.054
since there's going
to be plenty of kids

02:58.137 --> 02:59.555
and plenty of
opportunities for you

02:59.639 --> 03:02.517
to take advantage of at my
beach house this summer.

03:04.102 --> 03:06.521
It's a big summer
for all of us, really.

03:07.939 --> 03:10.441
You, your mom. Me, Steph.

03:11.776 --> 03:14.612
One day,
we could become a family.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.620
So, what do you say? Let's try
to get that score up. Huh?

03:22.954 --> 03:24.622
Aim higher than a three?

03:26.791 --> 03:28.418
That sound good?

03:33.297 --> 03:35.091
You up for that, buddy?

03:44.642 --> 03:48.813
<i>It must be nice to be
full of good advice to say</i>

03:52.817 --> 03:57.405
<i>It must be sweet,
but I'll call you if I need it</i>

03:59.991 --> 04:04.328
<i>I'm doing all right for the
time Fine for the time being</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:14.088
<i>I'll need professional help if
it does get any worse than this</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:22.346
<i>I'll be out on the ledge if it
does get any worse than this</i>

04:24.891 --> 04:29.854
<i>I'm doing all right for the
time Fine for the time being</i>

04:33.065 --> 04:38.529
<i>You think you know me well</i>

04:41.699 --> 04:46.621
<i>You think you know me well</i>

04:50.374 --> 04:55.129
<i>But you don't know me at all</i>

04:56.881 --> 04:58.216
This is it.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.395
Dad, could I get the keys?

05:34.377 --> 05:35.461
Are you kidding me?

05:35.545 --> 05:37.380
Thank God!

05:37.588 --> 05:38.840
Another night of drinking alone

05:38.965 --> 05:40.205
and I was going to kill myself!

05:40.258 --> 05:41.342
Hey!

05:41.425 --> 05:43.094
I'm off the wagon again.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.429
Accept it and move on.

05:47.098 --> 05:49.183
Oh, my God.
Press my laundry.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.393
Oh, Trent.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.477
How're you doing?

05:51.686 --> 05:53.187
I'm good.
I like this.

05:53.271 --> 05:55.523
I love your ride. Does the
eight track still work?

05:55.606 --> 05:58.985
What this? This is exactly the
car my dad used to drive us in.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.361
Old and crappy.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.608
Do you have any idea how
much I've spent on this car?

06:02.613 --> 06:04.198
This is cherry.
This is a cherry car.

06:04.282 --> 06:05.825
A car salesman with bad taste.

06:05.908 --> 06:06.868
Shocker.

06:06.951 --> 06:07.952
Hi. I'm Betty.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.036
Hi, Pam.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.748
Trent's probably already
talked crap about me.

06:12.832 --> 06:13.833
No.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.918
He did, didn't he?
It's okay if he has.

06:16.002 --> 06:17.795
What did he say?

06:18.588 --> 06:19.881
I'm loving this.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.132
Oh, thank you.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.010
I couldn't pull it off.
My hair seems to hate me.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.554
That's where you're supposed
to say, "Your hair's lovely."

06:26.637 --> 06:28.347
Oh, it, is.
It is lovely.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.807
Okay.

06:30.016 --> 06:31.142
I like her.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.685
What's not to like?

06:34.937 --> 06:38.399
Get it where you can. I'd be on
my back after a line like that.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.572
Susanna, Trent's here.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.574
This is his new girlfriend,
Pam.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.159
Hi, Susanna.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.745
Say, "Hi."

06:51.662 --> 06:52.747
Hi.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.293
Yeah, but don't come down.

06:57.877 --> 07:00.254
Just stand there, brooding.

07:00.796 --> 07:01.797
Oh!

07:01.923 --> 07:04.508
You've brought me a man.
How thoughtful.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.843
Hello, sailor.

07:06.510 --> 07:10.306
Who is this in all
his awkward stage glory?

07:10.389 --> 07:11.510
This is my son, Duncan.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.975
Everybody lends a hand.

07:13.059 --> 07:15.144
Oh, my God. I was going to
name my youngest Duncan,

07:15.227 --> 07:16.979
but my ex-husband thought
it was too nerdy.

07:17.063 --> 07:19.440
So, we went with Peter. Which,
personally, I think is worse.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.858
But, it suits my son, so...

07:20.942 --> 07:23.110
Oh, don't worry,
you wear the name well.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.278
Trent, where's Steph?

07:24.362 --> 07:25.988
We've been here
all of two minutes,

07:26.072 --> 07:27.657
so I suppose she's getting
ready for the beach.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.076
Oh, my God. She's just like me.
Screw cancer.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.620
I want to be an even golden brown.
Everywhere.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.289
Everybody's back this year.
The Gales. The Hutchisons.

07:35.373 --> 07:37.458
The Campbells, sans Ben
because of the trial.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.626
Insider trading.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.046
The Smythes. Oh, and the
Keegans, who I'm not talking to.

07:42.213 --> 07:45.007
You can if you want to, but just
know that most of us aren't.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.300
Okay.

07:46.384 --> 07:48.094
So, do you think you will?
Pam?

07:48.177 --> 07:49.387
Do I think I will, what?

07:49.470 --> 07:50.972
Talk to the Keegans.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.933
Oh, I don't know.
I don't even know them.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.811
Do if you want to but just
know that I'm mad at them.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.021
I don't even want
to get into why.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.524
They called me
a See-You-Next-Tuesday.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.942
To my face.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.236
You're going to love it here!
Whoo!

08:05.361 --> 08:06.988
I've only had one.

08:07.989 --> 08:09.240
Yee-haw!

08:14.161 --> 08:15.579
So, how was your winter?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.081
Because our year
was a challenge.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.582
My niece was raped in October.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.918
Oh, my God!

08:21.002 --> 08:22.920
I know.
Not even food courts are safe

08:23.004 --> 08:25.006
Oh, and Bob,
that's my ex-husband.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.674
Finally came out of
the closet. Not a shock.

08:26.757 --> 08:27.758
Let's just say that, in bed,

08:27.842 --> 08:30.344
his favorite view was
the back of my head.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.639
My oldest, Charlie, is still into
the drugs and psychedelic music.

08:33.722 --> 08:37.852
Drugs I get. But, come on, Gary
Garcia's dead! Get over it.

08:37.934 --> 08:38.977
Gary?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.062
Don't do drugs, Declan.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.147
Duncan.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.399
Oh, and Susanna. You saw her.
She's a walking mood.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.192
She's going through
an "I hate my mother" phase.

08:45.276 --> 08:46.485
Taking her father's side,
as usual.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.570
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.823
Oh, Steph,
don't you look so cute.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.241
That's exactly
the kind of suit that

08:52.366 --> 08:53.606
got me pregnant the first time.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.994
That's what I'm hoping for.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.078
Hey.

08:56.162 --> 08:57.204
I'm kidding!

08:57.288 --> 09:00.291
Oh, and Peter. Finally got his
surgery to fix his lazy eye.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.542
Now, it's even worse.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.960
I try to get him to
wear an eye patch,

09:03.044 --> 09:06.547
so people don't feel awkward.
But, what are you gonna do?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.590
I'm outta here.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.967
Oh, why don't you
take Duncan with you?

09:10.051 --> 09:13.721
Screw that. I told you I'm not
baby-sitting him all summer.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.723
You're gonna take Duncan
with you, young lady. All right?

09:15.806 --> 09:17.391
Why don't you go to the beach, honey?
You'll have fun.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.435
We're just going to
be unpacking here.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.896
We might be doing
some other stuff, too.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.439
Mmm.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.777
That's our cue, kids.
Come on.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.237
Now, listen, I am still having my
annual Fourth of July Clambake.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.363
And it will
bleed into your yard.

09:31.447 --> 09:32.448
Okay.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.700
Bob or no Bob,
the party must go on.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.787
He's probably sliding
off our gardener right now.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.496
Let's have a fun summer!

09:41.624 --> 09:43.209
Duncan, are you coming or what?

09:54.178 --> 09:55.513
Have fun.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.311
Just keep your distance.

10:02.394 --> 10:06.232
And, just don't die. I don't need
that shit hanging over my head.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.031
<i>We can absolutely
party at my place.</i>

10:14.198 --> 10:16.492
My dad only gets to see me,
like, twice a year,

10:16.575 --> 10:18.452
so he totally just
wants me to be happy.

10:18.536 --> 10:21.122
That's exactly the type of
parent I'm going to be.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.748
I'm gonna do drugs
with my kids.

10:22.832 --> 10:27.086
Oh, my God. I forgot.
Willem broke up with Jessica!

10:27.711 --> 10:28.796
No!

10:28.879 --> 10:30.840
Good. I don't get her face.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.883
It's like she fell on it.

10:32.967 --> 10:36.345
Oh, my God! Susanna, you have
to get on that this summer.

10:36.971 --> 10:37.972
Yeah.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.057
Chad!

10:40.516 --> 10:41.767
Chad!

10:43.269 --> 10:44.436
Chad!

10:44.520 --> 10:45.521
What?

10:45.604 --> 10:47.273
I want to go in the water!

10:47.356 --> 10:48.357
Then, go!

10:48.524 --> 10:51.986
Baby, I'm right in the middle of tossing.
We talked about this.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.489
All right.
He's being weird.

10:56.407 --> 10:57.449
Let's go.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.788
Ew! What are you
staring at, perv?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.541
Where is that kid from, anyway?

11:05.708 --> 11:06.750
Albany.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.252
He and his mom.

11:08.419 --> 11:11.255
My dad says they live
in a one-bedroom apartment.

11:11.422 --> 11:12.590
Tragic.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.216
I know, right?

11:15.217 --> 11:17.386
Uh, Susanna.
We're all swimming!

11:20.598 --> 11:21.932
What is her deal?

11:22.099 --> 11:24.768
I don't know. She's been
like that since we got here.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.086
Duncan. We were just
coming to find you

11:51.170 --> 11:52.338
This is Peter.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.589
Hey, Duncan.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.801
Hey.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.428
Oh.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.672
Just stare at the bridge of his nose.
That's what I do.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.390
Mom.
Are you shitting me?

12:03.933 --> 12:04.975
If you wore the patch,

12:05.059 --> 12:07.228
I wouldn't have to keep
telling people that, would I?

12:07.311 --> 12:09.897
Duncan, I thought you and Peter
should hang out this summer.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.524
Lord knows he brought enough
of his Star Wars dolls.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.902
They're action figures!
And they're classics!

12:14.985 --> 12:15.986
Please.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.738
They lose value if I take
them out of the box.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.490
But we can still have
awesome battles with them.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.574
He needs human contact.

12:20.658 --> 12:22.368
He's having far too many
conversations with those dolls.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.494
No, I'm not!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.977
Should we set up a time for you
two to get together tomorrow?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.164
Um...

12:27.248 --> 12:29.959
I should check with my mom.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.585
Oh. Okay.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.673
Don't stand us up.
We know where you live!

12:36.840 --> 12:39.593
I told you. Your eye makes
people uncomfortable.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.762
You're the worst parent.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.472
That is your father talking.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.932
Did he tell you to say that?

12:45.015 --> 12:46.016
Yeah.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.184
He did?

12:47.268 --> 12:48.310
Yes.

12:48.394 --> 12:49.728
That's terrible.

12:52.189 --> 12:58.070
<i>And I can't fight
this feelin' anymore</i>

12:58.487 --> 13:04.285
<i>Forgotten what
I started fightin' for</i>

13:04.493 --> 13:09.164
<i>It's time to bring
the ship into the shore</i>

13:09.331 --> 13:10.874
<i>And throw away...</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:19.049
Not doing it.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.468
You put it on.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.055
<i>Fire burns lust like me</i>

13:25.222 --> 13:27.016
No, no, no, no.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.394
Help me. No!

13:30.561 --> 13:31.562
Come on!

13:37.401 --> 13:38.485
No.

13:38.569 --> 13:42.448
<i>Carry a laser down the road
that I must travel</i>

13:43.615 --> 13:48.704
<i>Carry a laser down the
darkness of the night</i>

13:48.871 --> 13:50.372
<i>Carry a laser...</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:53.500
Whoa! Whoa! Are you saying,
"Carry a laser?"

13:53.709 --> 13:54.752
That's what it is.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.671
Why would anybody write a
song called, "Carry A Laser?"

13:57.755 --> 13:59.798
Because they like outer space.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.636
Uh-oh!

14:05.095 --> 14:08.098
You just walked into the
wrong room, stranger.

14:08.182 --> 14:09.266
Who are you?

14:09.350 --> 14:10.351
Mom.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.019
This is Duncan, my son.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.688
These are Trent's friends,
Joan and Kip.

14:14.772 --> 14:18.442
Chief, I'm Kip. I'm the one who's
not grinding on you right now.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.152
I'm not grinding on him.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.362
Yes, you are.

14:21.445 --> 14:25.532
<i>Carry a laser down the
road that I must travel</i>

14:25.616 --> 14:27.076
I'll make it worse.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.079
Mom, no.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.748
I'm out of here.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.750
Oh, wait.
I made dinner.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.544
Oh, shoot.
I have plans.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.214
Steph, wait,
check out his moves.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.382
Whoo!

14:44.009 --> 14:45.469
Enjoy therapy.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.847
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.100
See you, Dad.
See you.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.777
All right, we did that.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.238
Not me.
I could barely watch that.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.282
Buddy, any chance
you were on top of my car?

15:08.117 --> 15:09.159
No.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.329
Okay. 'Cause there
was a dent in the roof.

15:12.663 --> 15:13.831
Big dent.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.416
It popped out.
It's fine.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.460
I was just wondering if you
knew anything about that?

15:19.002 --> 15:20.754
We did have bags
up there, honey.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.298
That's true.
We did. Fair enough.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.679
That was probably it. Right?

15:31.849 --> 15:33.642
Hey, Pam.
You need a hand?

15:33.851 --> 15:37.187
Oh, no. Thank you. We've got
a system going on here.

15:37.688 --> 15:40.357
Yeah! We got
a good team here. Right?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.110
Good team.

15:43.277 --> 15:44.278
Adorable.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.822
Can you pass me something
to eat, sweetie?

15:47.531 --> 15:51.827
No, I can tell you
exactly where I was.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.704
Passed out in the dunes.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.122
That's true!

15:55.205 --> 15:56.957
Yes! Because,
you left me there!

15:57.040 --> 16:00.752
No, wait! Kip wanted
to go out on his boat.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.671
He said you would
be fine by the fire.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.049
Here's what he said! "Yoo, hoo!
You never came back."

16:06.216 --> 16:07.426
No, we didn't.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.178
I came back the next morning.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.471
Yes!
First thing.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.223
And I had to poke her
with a stick to wake her.

16:15.225 --> 16:18.645
You know, I once went to
this luau-themed party.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.231
I'm sorry. No, please.
You were talking...

16:21.398 --> 16:22.566
No, you go.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.151
Tell your story, babe.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.194
No, it's dumb.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.237
Well, now you have to tell it.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.991
I went to this luau and I
passed out in the dunes, too.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.576
That's basically it.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.081
That's so funny.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.585
No, it's just
a similar thing to...

16:41.752 --> 16:42.920
No, totally.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.509
I have to point out by the way I'm
loading up for the third time.

16:48.592 --> 16:49.593
Thank you.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.677
Bravo.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.679
And I apologize
for this asshole

16:52.763 --> 16:54.181
springing us on you
at the last minute.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.017
No, not at all. I'm a caterer.
I love cooking for people.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.102
Oh, you cater?
That makes sense.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.646
One of her many talents.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.190
Actually, she has some ideas
for fixing up the place.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.943
Oh, yeah? Are you
gonna fix up the Riptide?

17:06.609 --> 17:09.445
No,
I just mentioned rearranging.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.907
You should. Put your stamp on it.
I'm not set in my ways.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.701
Tell that to Christine.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.622
"Somebody took my weed."

17:21.959 --> 17:25.253
Okay. I'm sorry. I have to put
my son out of his misery.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.797
You're free to go.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.384
Hey, buddy,
take your plate with you.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.970
We clean up after
ourselves in this house.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.098
Okay, back to my story.

17:36.473 --> 17:40.602
Trent was it last summer that you
and I got stuck on our boat?

17:40.769 --> 17:44.231
That is because this bastard buys
gas three dollars at a time!

17:56.952 --> 17:59.830
Susanna, close the screen door!

17:59.997 --> 18:02.291
I'm getting eaten
alive by mosquitoes!

18:08.463 --> 18:11.174
I don't like the way you're
acting, young lady!

18:11.341 --> 18:13.969
You wouldn't be this way
if your dad was here!

18:18.682 --> 18:19.683
Hey.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.560
Hey.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.231
Sorry about that.
I didn't...

18:26.315 --> 18:27.524
I don't care.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.485
It's not like we were
using our inside voices.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.863
That's cool.
That's cool.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.200
So, you're a big fan
of REO Speedwagon?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.369
What?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.705
<i>Can't Fight This Feeling?</i>

18:42.456 --> 18:45.292
Oh, no. My mom must
have put that on there.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.836
Oh, and you just got to it
and thought,

18:47.919 --> 18:51.340
"What the hell. I'm going to sing
the shit out of it, anyway?"

18:52.341 --> 18:53.842
Something like that.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.933
Sucks here, huh?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.644
It's okay.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.687
It sucks.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.230
No. Totally.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.108
It blows.

19:10.651 --> 19:11.985
So much.

19:13.528 --> 19:14.863
It's tough, yeah.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.456
All right.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.506
It feels like it's going
to be a hot summer.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.509
Oh.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.469
I thought we were done.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.012
Oh.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.766
I was just thinking about that earlier.
The hot thing.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.976
And it just came to me again.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.437
So, I said it.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.940
Okay.

19:51.108 --> 19:54.528
Well, if anything else
comes to you again,

19:55.779 --> 19:57.155
I will be inside.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.513
Are you kidding me?

20:22.973 --> 20:25.016
They drank all the beer.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.404
You're not looking
in the right place.

20:37.487 --> 20:40.490
Don't get mad at me, Peter. I
don't know where you're looking!

20:40.574 --> 20:41.742
Forget it!
It's gone!

20:41.825 --> 20:43.869
No, next time you say,
"Look at the seagull,"

20:43.952 --> 20:45.454
you just have to
remember to point!

20:45.537 --> 20:48.749
There goes one there now.
"Look at the seagull, Mother.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.084
"I wanna share it with you."
Isn't it pretty?

20:51.168 --> 20:53.795
"Look at the fence.
Look at me! Look!"

20:54.337 --> 20:56.423
Just point.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.573
<i>Here I go</i>

21:22.574 --> 21:24.117
<i>Out the door</i>

21:25.827 --> 21:29.414
<i>I don't need no more</i>

21:29.998 --> 21:31.541
<i>Here I stand</i>

21:32.459 --> 21:34.169
<i>I got your hand</i>

21:35.962 --> 21:39.132
<i>There's no need to know</i>

21:39.800 --> 21:41.468
<i>Which way to go</i>

21:45.722 --> 21:47.766
<i>It's her versus him</i>

21:47.849 --> 21:50.393
<i>It's us against them</i>

21:50.519 --> 21:55.023
<i>You sink or swim
Or you're swallowed</i>

21:55.857 --> 22:00.529
<i>You bleed till you're bled
You feed till you're fed</i>

22:00.654 --> 22:02.489
<i>You lead or you're led...</i>

22:02.572 --> 22:03.990
<i>Lemonade?</i>

22:23.927 --> 22:25.262
Do you mind
standing to the side?

22:25.345 --> 22:27.389
I'm getting your reflection
in the screen.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.640
Sorry.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.976
I wouldn't normally care, but
I'm having the game of my life.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.769
I'm on the cherry level.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.646
But that's the first level.

22:34.729 --> 22:38.650
Yeah, and I got one man left. So, like
I said, it's the game of my life.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.319
You like Pac Man?

22:41.403 --> 22:42.529
What?

22:42.696 --> 22:44.030
It's a classic!

22:44.614 --> 22:46.950
Not into all the bells
and whistles, my man.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.451
Too much going on.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.122
See, my mistake is
that I get greedy.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.082
Going for all
the ghosts and fruits

22:54.207 --> 22:56.042
instead of just
clearing pellets.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.378
You know, there's a pattern.
Right?

22:58.461 --> 23:01.965
Oh, don't tell me
you're one of those guys.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.552
Takes all the challenge out of it.
Anybody can learn a pattern.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.304
Owen, we gotta go!

23:07.762 --> 23:09.097
Come on.
Lunch hour's over.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.266
Well, so much for the game
of my life.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.601
But you still have
one more man left.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.061
No, I've yet to
see the second board.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.522
Gives me something
to look forward to.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.024
The board's always the same.

23:19.107 --> 23:22.027
Well, there's that.
Thank you. Now, I can die.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.153
Here. Get in here.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.237
No, I...

23:24.321 --> 23:25.655
Come on, come on.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.242
But, listen,
it's still my quarter.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.660
So, if you end up getting a high
score, I don't want to see...

23:30.744 --> 23:31.745
What's your name?

23:31.828 --> 23:32.913
Duncan.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.206
I don't want to see
that up on the screen.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.667
Oh, they only let
you use three letters.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.502
Wow.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.923
Nothing's left to the
imagination with you, huh, kid?

23:44.674 --> 23:46.259
Oh and hey!

23:46.676 --> 23:50.180
No pattern on my quarter.
Cut your own path.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.776
There you are. We were just
about to leave without you.

24:02.859 --> 24:03.944
Where did you go off to?

24:04.027 --> 24:04.986
Nowhere.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.071
Let's leave notes, okay?

24:06.154 --> 24:07.447
Your mom was worried.

24:07.530 --> 24:08.531
You need to get
your swim trunks on.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.033
Kip and Joan have invited
us out on their boat.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.618
We're gonna be late.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.413
<i>Head's up, buddy.</i>

24:15.872 --> 24:16.957
You need to wear that.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.375
I think he's gonna be
all right without that.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.793
No, Duncan can't swim.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.628
Trent, he's just not
a comfortable swimmer.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.471
I really think he's
gonna be okay without it.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.633
No, just wear it. So people
don't have to worry about you.

24:28.385 --> 24:31.388
Yes, we're inviting ourselves.
Accept it and move on.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.556
Peter does have to
stay down below though.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.975
His eye throws
off his equilibrium

24:35.100 --> 24:36.434
and he will get
sick everywhere.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.727
No, I won't, Mom!

24:37.811 --> 24:39.479
Tell that to the bucket
we have to bring!

24:39.562 --> 24:41.982
Mom, why do I have to wear this?
Nobody else does.

24:42.065 --> 24:44.526
He just wants you to be safe.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.070
Is that snug enough?

24:51.574 --> 24:53.118
You know what?
We take our shoes off.

24:53.201 --> 24:54.244
Oh, God. Sorry.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.829
Tell me this is
gonna clear, Trent.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.163
It's gonna clear.

24:57.247 --> 24:59.040
My titties need some color.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.845
<i>Basically, he was relentless.</i>

25:12.137 --> 25:14.180
And don't get me wrong.
I was looking.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.975
I had been divorced
for well over a year.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.103
It just took a little
persistence on my end.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.106
I wasn't sure about you.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.941
I met her when she was catering

25:25.066 --> 25:26.818
some Halloween party in Albany.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.319
He went as a sexy cop.

25:28.403 --> 25:29.529
Oh, God!

25:29.612 --> 25:31.114
No. I went as a '70s,
badass cop.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.700
Oh, he followed me
around all night,

25:33.783 --> 25:36.119
saying that he was there
to "protect and serve" me.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.722
That about ended it
right there for me.

25:37.746 --> 25:40.540
Sadly, I would have been
working his bag at that point.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.208
However, I do remember.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.378
You did let me help you pack your
van at the end of the night.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.047
Yes, I did.
Yes, you did.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.049
Then it took three months
to get her to go out with me.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.717
Three months?

25:51.676 --> 25:53.720
I did not know
you had that kind of stamina.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.221
She definitely
made me work for it.

25:55.305 --> 25:56.264
But it was worth it.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.308
There may be hope for you yet.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.685
What finally changed your mind?

26:00.769 --> 26:03.480
He said we were
already in this together,

26:04.606 --> 26:06.107
so I might as well.

26:07.859 --> 26:09.569
It's been almost a year.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.821
Yeah.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.663
Duncan.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.501
You guys, help yourselves.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.674
Could you look
a little more miserable?

26:31.758 --> 26:33.802
Could he be even
more of a dick?

26:33.927 --> 26:36.638
Hey. He's making an effort.

26:36.805 --> 26:39.182
He wants this to work.
He wants us to be a family.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.976
Yeah, he says that, but
that's not what he does.

26:42.352 --> 26:45.230
Look, I know this isn't easy,
but you promised, remember?

26:45.313 --> 26:46.815
You'd give it a try.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.860
I don't understand why I can't
just spend the summer with Dad.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.697
Because you're with me.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.919
Hey, buddy, the cooler's not going
to get to the car by itself.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.747
Good morning, sweetheart.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.667
Do you want some breakfast?

28:29.792 --> 28:31.336
No. I'm good.

28:42.096 --> 28:43.848
<i>Look up here</i>

28:44.140 --> 28:48.394
<i>Most people can't make
out the difference</i>

28:48.478 --> 28:52.315
<i>But it could be a small change</i>

28:53.483 --> 28:57.195
<i>In the light</i>

29:05.328 --> 29:07.664
<i>Attention Water Wizz patrons.</i>

29:07.914 --> 29:11.334
<i>Will the owner of a beige minivan
with New York license plates</i>

29:11.417 --> 29:14.504
<i>please move your vehicle?
You're blocking someone else.</i>

29:16.214 --> 29:21.511
<i>Is this coincidence
or connection</i>

29:24.430 --> 29:27.308
<i>Come and see</i>

29:28.142 --> 29:35.149
<i>Fall to your knees
and hear the call</i>

29:35.358 --> 29:40.113
<i>Are you lovesick for it all</i>

29:40.196 --> 29:43.032
<i>It's another hot one
at Water Wizz.</i>

29:43.199 --> 29:45.868
<i>Be sure to cool off
at Salty Dog's Sugar Shack</i>

29:45.952 --> 29:47.537
<i>with homemade ice cream.</i>

29:47.620 --> 29:50.164
<i>And if you're looking to avoid
the lines you can upgrade</i>

29:50.248 --> 29:52.709
<i>with our “Wizz to the Front“
Priority Pass.</i>

29:52.792 --> 29:55.003
<i>Drop by the office
for more details.</i>

30:03.636 --> 30:06.681
<i>Let's all enjoy
a wet and wonderful afternoon.</i>

30:25.658 --> 30:27.327
Hey, Pac Man kid!

30:27.618 --> 30:28.786
How'd we do?

30:28.953 --> 30:31.331
Nothing less than
highest score I hope.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.624
I've got a reputation
to protect.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.460
Hey.

30:35.543 --> 30:36.586
Hey.

30:36.753 --> 30:39.922
Whenever's convenient for you,
we are open for business.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.216
Hey, Caitlin,
I'm going on break.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.886
Cool. I got a great idea.

30:45.094 --> 30:46.846
Why not, I don't know,

30:47.472 --> 30:49.057
put on some pants.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.641
She's being coy.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.852
But she digs me.
Big time.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.438
Just a thought.
You know what? Scratch it.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.232
Just like that's professional.

30:58.733 --> 31:00.193
See what I did there?

31:00.276 --> 31:03.029
I manipulated her
with my sexual charisma.

31:03.112 --> 31:04.072
Yeah.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.740
Yeah.
It was clever as shit.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.241
Why don't you come down
from your apartment

31:07.325 --> 31:09.035
and actually manage this place?

31:09.118 --> 31:12.455
Why don't you come on up here
and we'll talk about politics?

31:18.002 --> 31:19.170
Sweet ride.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.132
Oh, it's not mine.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.759
Yeah, I figured.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.971
You were right, by the way.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.057
It is a hot summer.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.644
Yeah, I just call it
like I see it.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.983
I'm just waiting for my dad
to call me back.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.735
I don't want to be inside
because my mom

31:42.819 --> 31:45.071
just stares at me
while I'm on the phone.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.155
She's all freaked out

31:46.239 --> 31:49.033
that I'm gonna want to
live with him or whatever.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.122
My mom's the same way.

31:56.624 --> 31:57.625
See you.

32:00.503 --> 32:03.339
So, let me know if you have
any other observations

32:03.423 --> 32:04.924
on weather patterns.

32:05.258 --> 32:06.592
Will do.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.605
I'll check and see
if he's out front.

32:27.905 --> 32:28.948
I wonder where he is.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.116
Oh, he'll turn up.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.034
Have you seen my flip-flops?

33:17.413 --> 33:19.624
I thought we had a deal
about leaving notes.

33:19.707 --> 33:20.875
Checking in.

33:22.376 --> 33:23.753
My mom and I do.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.839
You worried her. Again.

33:27.632 --> 33:29.634
I told her I'd wait up for you.

33:30.384 --> 33:31.636
Well, I'm here.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.262
Hey, Duncan?

33:34.263 --> 33:37.350
I'm not interested in talking
to the back of your head.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.192
If we're going
to make this work,

33:46.817 --> 33:48.194
and it is "we,"

33:48.778 --> 33:52.365
then there has to be trust.
And respect. Am I right?

33:52.532 --> 33:54.825
I think that's something
we both want.

33:56.786 --> 33:57.787
Fine.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.497
There you go, buddy.

34:12.677 --> 34:15.012
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.222
What?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.558
Yeah, you're going to have to take off.
I'm getting complaints.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.143
You're having too much fun. It's
making everyone uncomfortable.

34:22.812 --> 34:23.980
Okay.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.732
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.194
I'm just kidding.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.283
Wow. That wasn't
even my best stuff.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.201
Are you for real?

34:38.703 --> 34:41.746
I can tell you're in complete
awe of our picnic table.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.206
It is one-of-a-kind

34:43.291 --> 34:45.650
except for the 200 other ones
here that are exactly like it.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.837
But there is more park
to be seen.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.089
First things first.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.716
As much as I'm
a fan of Tuff Skins,

34:51.799 --> 34:53.801
we've got to get
you a swimsuit.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.429
Seriously, when's the last
time you bought jeans?

34:56.512 --> 34:58.014
<i>My mom buys my jeans.</i>

34:58.139 --> 35:00.099
Good.
Always take things literally.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.603
How's that working out for you?
Does that get you laid?

35:09.483 --> 35:11.569
Lewis,
hook up my man Duncan here

35:11.652 --> 35:13.446
with one of our finest
rentals would you?

35:13.529 --> 35:15.448
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.784
Sexy. Let's try not to impress
him all at once. Huh?

35:18.993 --> 35:20.286
That will not be a challenge.

35:20.369 --> 35:21.954
Lewis is kind of
over this place.

35:22.038 --> 35:23.414
I told you.
I'm not long for here.

35:23.497 --> 35:24.790
No,
I remember that conversation.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.835
In 2003, 5, 11, April.

35:28.628 --> 35:29.712
Yesterday.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.340
Can't eat that now.
Your dirty mouth's been on it.

35:32.423 --> 35:33.424
Germophobe.

35:33.507 --> 35:36.177
I've just told you.
There are things I want to do.

35:36.260 --> 35:39.013
Prove it. Without thinking
rattle off three. Go!

35:39.472 --> 35:40.973
See New Mexico.
Invent something.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.266
Become a storm chaser.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.684
You had me until number three.

35:43.768 --> 35:45.269
I think you have to
go to school for that.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.188
"Look. There's a storm."
"Where?" "Over there." "Cool."

35:47.271 --> 35:48.397
"Let's go get it." "Got it."

35:48.481 --> 35:49.482
He actually is.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.525
He's been studying meteorology
since pre-school.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.319
Don't let the Dahmer
glasses fool you.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.489
These don't have any mesh,
so you're going commando.

35:56.906 --> 35:59.241
Watch sitting.
Your junk will fall out.

35:59.617 --> 36:02.036
Found that out the hard way
at a birthday party.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.955
And like that you're impressed.
And grossed out.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.832
Bye Lewis.
Bye.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.505
Water Wizz Waterpark.
Built in the summer of '83,

36:12.588 --> 36:14.674
it's the last bastion of everything
that time period stood for.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.300
In fact, it was decreed
by its creator

36:16.384 --> 36:18.094
that this place
shall never age.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.303
On his deathbed, he said,

36:19.387 --> 36:20.763
"I don't want this place
re-painted or updated."

36:20.846 --> 36:21.847
"I don't even want
it brought up to code."

36:21.931 --> 36:24.058
"And the minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed."

36:24.141 --> 36:26.894
We actually have a nuclear bomb
for just such an occasion.

36:26.977 --> 36:28.479
Bought it off the Russians.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.691
Really? Still good with all that?
Even the Russian thing?

36:31.774 --> 36:33.484
That's Cold War.
It's kind of dated.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.902
All right,
that was a waste of a bit.

36:34.985 --> 36:35.986
Hey.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.071
Hey.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.515
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.951
What? Why is this the first I'm
hearing of this? Damn it, woman!

36:42.034 --> 36:43.661
Caitlin, Duncan.
Tony, Mary Beth.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.996
Hi, Duncan. Also, I need
you to reorder more mats.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.081
Did it.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.207
Finish the work schedule
for next week.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.250
Did it.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.543
Change all the filters.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.585
Done.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.462
You know, I'm going to check
all that stuff, right?

36:53.546 --> 36:54.964
Then, in that case,
I didn't do any of that.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.048
So, I'm doing it.

36:56.132 --> 36:59.385
It's called delegation. I read
about it in a book about it.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.804
That's the one
you wait for, my man.

37:02.138 --> 37:03.139
Oh, yeah.

37:03.556 --> 37:05.558
She looked back.
She likes me.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.858
This is Devil's Peak. The largest
waterslide in a 50-mile radius.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.277
Stretch out the tube, end to end.
13 football fields.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.486
Don't Google that
for confirmation.

37:17.570 --> 37:19.155
That fact predates technology.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.115
Owen, settle a debate for us.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.993
Hello, boys. Duncan, this is
Vladimir, Ishmael, and Ming Lee.

37:24.076 --> 37:25.161
Those aren't our names!

37:25.244 --> 37:26.287
Those are the names
I'm giving you, Vlady.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.330
These are my illegitimate sons.
They all have different mothers.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.832
I'm trying to be a positive
influence in their lives.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.460
Take them to Little League, Boys
Club, raising pandas to fight.

37:32.543 --> 37:33.878
Shut up, jackass!

37:34.044 --> 37:35.129
Cloud fencing, hooker retreats.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.465
Neil says that years ago
some kid figured out

37:37.548 --> 37:39.842
how to pass someone on the water slide.
Is that true?

37:39.925 --> 37:40.968
He did!

37:41.051 --> 37:42.219
It's physically impossible,
Neil!

37:42.303 --> 37:44.305
You can't catch up to
someone and pass them!

37:44.388 --> 37:47.433
Actually, Ming Lee's right.
I was here when it happened.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.226
All right, then how'd he do it?

37:49.310 --> 37:51.103
It happened inside the tube.
So, no one really knows.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.563
Only the kid and
the person he passed.

37:52.646 --> 37:55.775
And Jesus Christ, our lord. But,
he's a little hard to get a hold of.

37:55.858 --> 37:56.942
He won't return my calls.

37:57.026 --> 38:00.029
We wore the same shirt to a party
and it got a little weird.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.238
Be serious!

38:01.405 --> 38:03.741
Don't interrupt him, Neil!
He's talking!

38:03.824 --> 38:06.202
Guys, what happens in the tube
stays in the tube.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.329
That's just the law
of the park.

38:08.621 --> 38:11.123
Bullshit. We'll just ask
the kid how he did it.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.500
Be my guest
if you can find him.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.126
Last I heard he went
into a deep depression.

38:14.210 --> 38:15.377
The fame was too much.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.880
He turned to cocaine
to escape the limelight.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.174
And eventually,
a life of male prostitution.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.593
Oh, no. Wait. There he is. You got sober.
You look good.

38:22.676 --> 38:23.677
Good for you!

38:23.761 --> 38:24.845
Screw you, Owen!

38:24.929 --> 38:26.180
Yeah, screw you, Owen.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.640
I just said that, Neil!

38:27.723 --> 38:29.183
I'm being supportive!

38:29.266 --> 38:32.520
Actually, that crack-addled
male whore was me.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.104
Really?

38:34.188 --> 38:35.231
Wow!

38:35.606 --> 38:37.024
Do you get comedy?

38:39.902 --> 38:42.071
So, did he pass him by sliding
up the side of the tube?

38:42.154 --> 38:43.656
I'm not telling you.

38:43.948 --> 38:45.032
But I want to know!

38:45.115 --> 38:47.576
That's a good thing.
Don't die wondering.

38:48.035 --> 38:51.121
All right, Hot Rod,
what's happening?

38:52.039 --> 38:53.958
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.126
Wow!
Pointless news travels fast.

38:56.961 --> 39:01.298
Can I get a special ride "with
benefits" for my man, Duncan?

39:02.049 --> 39:03.300
Yeah, hold on.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.095
This slide's out of order.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.388
Watch this.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.849
Yeah,
you gotta use the other one.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.561
Actually, you know what? I think
it's back in order. Okay.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.271
Come on, step up, please.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.605
Okay. Hold on.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.899
Just hold there for a sec.

39:20.442 --> 39:21.402
Hold.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.779
This guy's an artist.
Watch and learn.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.575
And you are holding.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.329
Still holding.

39:33.205 --> 39:36.584
All right, I think we're all set
to hold a little bit longer.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.796
Okay, step back a little bit.
Okay, step forward.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.549
Okay, stay there.
Step back. And hold.

39:44.592 --> 39:45.718
Okay.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.303
Look at him.
It's gorgeous.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.138
Just about ready to hold.

39:49.471 --> 39:50.681
Okay and go.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.224
Okay, go, go, go!

39:53.726 --> 39:55.185
Put your mat down.

40:18.834 --> 40:23.714
Oh, excuse me. I'm truly sorry.
I can't get my footing.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.550
Owen, come on!

40:26.717 --> 40:29.219
Oh, no! It looks
like you lost something.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.182
You just had to
take it too far.

40:33.724 --> 40:35.142
Too far!

40:35.726 --> 40:39.271
<i>Happy Fourth of July everyone.
In honor of America's birthday,</i>

40:39.438 --> 40:40.856
<i>the park will be closing early.</i>

40:40.940 --> 40:43.525
<i>But our doors reopen
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

40:43.692 --> 40:45.611
<i>Be sure to bring
back your tickets stubs</i>

40:45.694 --> 40:48.530
<i>to receive five dollars off
an all-day park pass.</i>

40:48.781 --> 40:53.243
<i>Have a safe and festive holiday
from all of us at Water Wizz.</i>

40:57.706 --> 41:00.084
Hey. What's up, cowboy?
You want a ride?

41:00.209 --> 41:01.460
No, thanks.
I've got my bike.

41:01.585 --> 41:03.170
Where are you staying?

41:03.253 --> 41:04.797
Over by the beach, on Hampton.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.675
That's far. And, people drive
like idiots on the Fourth.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.593
Throw your bike in the back.

41:10.427 --> 41:11.679
No. You don't have to.

41:11.762 --> 41:12.763
Come on.

41:13.430 --> 41:14.640
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.309
No, it's too much trouble.

41:17.393 --> 41:19.186
Duncan we've got to start
having faster conversations.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.105
Throw your bike in the back.

41:24.817 --> 41:26.819
I'd help you out but I got
my hands on the wheel.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.153
Giving you a ride.
I think that's enough.

41:28.237 --> 41:30.531
Where'd you get that?
The princess collection.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.241
Hey, easy, easy!

41:32.783 --> 41:35.244
The car's just
the right amount of shitty.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.004
So, what brought you
to the water park?

41:45.087 --> 41:48.340
Not many kids head our way when
the ocean's their backyard.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.761
I don't know. I guess there's
not much for me at home.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.227
How long have you
been working there?

42:00.602 --> 42:03.605
Oh! The park?
I've always been there.

42:03.772 --> 42:06.817
Ever since I was
a small Cambodian child.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.695
Of course, that was after 'Nam.
I was in the shit.

42:09.778 --> 42:12.656
Then I joined the circus
to become a clown fighter.

42:12.823 --> 42:16.035
I know about 46 ways to kill a clown.
I hate clowns.

42:16.660 --> 42:19.246
I'm kidding except for the part
where I really do hate them.

42:21.582 --> 42:22.916
Nice teamwork.

42:24.752 --> 42:25.836
I'm exhausted.

42:25.919 --> 42:26.879
Thanks for the ride.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.881
Hey, thanks for the memories.

42:33.552 --> 42:34.970
Hey, Evel Knievel.

42:35.429 --> 42:37.431
You're probably busy
or not interested,

42:37.514 --> 42:40.267
but I need somebody
to be a floater at the park.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.561
You know, do some odd jobs,
clean up some vomit.

42:42.644 --> 42:43.896
What do you think?

42:43.979 --> 42:46.023
Definitely.
Awesome. Yeah.

42:46.857 --> 42:49.943
If it's too much trouble, you
totally don't have to, but...

42:50.027 --> 42:51.236
If you need someone...

42:51.320 --> 42:52.321
Duncan.

42:52.613 --> 42:53.655
Yes.

42:53.739 --> 42:57.493
There you go.
Tomorrow. 9:00 a.m.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.215
Who was that you were with?

43:11.298 --> 43:12.424
Just a friend.

43:12.508 --> 43:13.634
A friend who drives?

43:13.717 --> 43:14.718
Mom.

43:14.927 --> 43:16.261
What's his name?

43:16.345 --> 43:17.429
Owen.

43:17.513 --> 43:18.555
And how do you know him?

43:18.639 --> 43:20.057
Mom, he's just a friend.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.809
A friend with a license?

43:21.892 --> 43:23.477
Well, you should bring him by.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.770
Okay? I'd like to meet him.

43:24.853 --> 43:25.938
Fine.

43:26.021 --> 43:27.481
Whoa. I'm not done.

43:28.190 --> 43:30.234
We don't stay out all night
and disappear all day.

43:30.317 --> 43:31.777
Do you understand me?

43:31.860 --> 43:34.196
I could say the same to you.

43:34.738 --> 43:35.864
What?

43:36.949 --> 43:38.992
I want you to make an
appearance at Betty's.

43:39.076 --> 43:40.077
Okay.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.120
I'm serious.

43:41.203 --> 43:42.412
Okay!

43:51.880 --> 43:54.550
Susanna! Susanna!
We're hanging over here.

43:54.633 --> 43:57.177
Come on. Grab a cup,
we're playing quarters!

43:57.261 --> 43:58.679
Maybe in a minute.

44:08.939 --> 44:11.441
This is empty.
And, that's just not right.

44:13.110 --> 44:14.278
Hey, Duncan.

44:14.444 --> 44:15.684
You should hang out with Peter.

44:15.737 --> 44:17.447
He's playing under
one of these tables.

44:17.531 --> 44:18.824
- Peter!
- What?

44:19.116 --> 44:20.617
There you go.

44:20.701 --> 44:23.162
Do you want me
to make you a plate of food?

44:23.245 --> 44:24.246
No, I can do it.

44:24.329 --> 44:27.374
Be sure to get some clams. They
were all my doing this year.

44:27.457 --> 44:30.210
Bring your food over here
and eat with me, okay?

44:31.336 --> 44:32.504
Okay.

44:36.133 --> 44:39.636
Charlie, don't do your "Dead"
dance so close to the fire!

44:39.803 --> 44:43.098
I don't need my first born
bursting into flames at my party.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.725
What's up, Peter?

44:44.975 --> 44:46.018
Hey, man.

44:46.143 --> 44:47.394
How's the battle going?

44:47.477 --> 44:49.396
Luke and Leia are hooking up.

44:50.647 --> 44:53.192
You know they're
brother and sister, right?

44:54.318 --> 44:55.444
Yeah.

44:56.570 --> 44:57.613
Cool.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.782
I'd avoid the clams
if I were you.

45:00.866 --> 45:04.119
They're one of the many casualties
of my father's absence.

45:04.870 --> 45:05.871
Oh.

45:07.915 --> 45:10.292
Just because your mom
will see my plate.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.463
It's your funeral.

45:16.048 --> 45:17.382
Oh, Charlie!

45:20.052 --> 45:22.638
Looks like my brother
just made another sale.

45:28.143 --> 45:29.645
We'll be right back.

45:36.193 --> 45:37.486
Hey. Peter.

45:37.569 --> 45:38.570
Yeah.

45:38.654 --> 45:39.821
You want to go
chase ghost crabs?

45:39.905 --> 45:41.281
Oh, hell, yeah!

45:42.157 --> 45:43.659
Duncan?
Any interest?

45:43.825 --> 45:44.952
Yeah. Sure.

45:57.005 --> 45:58.257
When I was younger,

45:58.340 --> 46:01.551
my dad used to bring me down
here to do this all the time.

46:02.302 --> 46:06.348
He'd fill my head with all these
useless facts about ghost crabs.

46:08.350 --> 46:10.686
Like, did you know
they're omnivorous?

46:11.353 --> 46:14.856
Basically, they eat
both animals and vegetables.

46:17.359 --> 46:20.529
My mom jokes,
"Leave it to your dad"

46:20.696 --> 46:24.032
"to be interested in a
creature that goes both ways."

46:29.371 --> 46:32.332
So, do you want me
to keep talking

46:32.499 --> 46:35.043
or are you going to
say something eventually?

46:38.046 --> 46:40.048
My mom doesn't smoke pot.

46:44.886 --> 46:46.847
That's the power of this place.

46:46.972 --> 46:48.932
It's like spring
break for adults.

46:52.394 --> 46:54.813
That's what I think
really kills my mom.

46:54.938 --> 46:56.356
Not that my dad left,

46:56.440 --> 46:58.942
but that he's got
someone and she doesn't.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.572
So, is your dad seeing anybody?

47:04.239 --> 47:05.991
Yeah, she's a lot younger.

47:06.158 --> 47:07.409
Classic.

47:07.576 --> 47:09.828
They're just getting
situated in San Diego.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.663
You know? New place.

47:12.414 --> 47:14.666
So, he says it's not
a great time right now.

47:14.750 --> 47:16.918
But I'm going to
go visit him soon

47:17.002 --> 47:18.920
once he gets settled.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.214
It's supposed to be
awesome out there.

47:21.298 --> 47:23.425
California.
That's cool.

47:23.592 --> 47:24.760
Yeah.

47:34.603 --> 47:36.271
So, where is it you go?

47:36.855 --> 47:38.106
Go where?

47:38.273 --> 47:40.108
On your sexy, pink cruiser?

47:41.818 --> 47:42.944
Nowhere.

47:43.278 --> 47:44.654
Oh. I see.

47:45.364 --> 47:46.698
No, I...
I just...

47:46.782 --> 47:49.451
It's okay.
Let it be yours.

47:52.204 --> 47:53.330
Good night.

47:54.539 --> 47:55.874
Yeah, good night.

48:24.945 --> 48:26.321
Oh, I see.

48:27.781 --> 48:29.533
Just not this summer?

48:43.964 --> 48:45.048
Who cares?

48:46.675 --> 48:48.593
We're never gonna die.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.765
You were gone that whole time

48:53.849 --> 48:57.102
and you only
brought the marshmallows?

48:57.769 --> 48:59.187
Joan has the rest.

49:06.778 --> 49:08.280
I can't get up!

49:16.580 --> 49:17.914
Here you go.

49:32.929 --> 49:34.556
Don't let them burn.

49:38.226 --> 49:39.478
I know I keep asking you.

49:39.561 --> 49:41.480
But when do we get
new employee T-shirts?

49:41.563 --> 49:44.232
Two years from yesterday.

49:44.566 --> 49:47.569
'Cause this one makes me
self-conscious about my body.

49:49.070 --> 49:50.655
You disappoint me, kid.

49:50.739 --> 49:53.450
You're late! You planning
on making a habit of this?

49:53.533 --> 49:54.493
What?

49:54.576 --> 49:55.785
You're fired.

49:55.869 --> 49:57.204
But I just...

49:57.370 --> 50:00.165
You make a valid point.
Welcome back. With benefits.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.834
You waste an exorbitant amount of time.
Do you know that?

50:02.918 --> 50:04.127
Suit up.

50:04.336 --> 50:05.420
You don't look too pumped.

50:05.504 --> 50:07.923
Come on, let's get pumped!

50:08.089 --> 50:10.926
<i>This is the place
where dreams are made</i>

50:11.092 --> 50:12.594
<i>Or destroyed</i>

50:12.761 --> 50:16.932
<i>Depends on how you feel about
working at a water park</i>

50:17.224 --> 50:20.227
We have a situation
over at Harpoon Lagoon.

50:20.393 --> 50:21.770
Is it a homicide?

50:22.521 --> 50:24.689
Yeah. It's a homicide.

50:24.856 --> 50:26.650
I knew this day would come.

50:29.569 --> 50:31.154
I'm gonna stay here

50:31.363 --> 50:34.032
in the booth no one comes to.

50:48.296 --> 50:49.798
Oh. No blood?

50:50.382 --> 50:52.092
They grabbed some cardboard
from the snack shack

50:52.175 --> 50:53.760
and started going to town.

50:53.843 --> 50:56.429
Mostly B-boying. Power,
Abstract, Blowup, Flavor.

50:56.513 --> 50:57.681
Mad moves though.

50:57.764 --> 50:59.849
Jackhammer, Applejacks,
Coin drops,

50:59.933 --> 51:02.269
rubber bands, Turtles, 1990s.

51:02.686 --> 51:03.895
Any Jookin? Buckin?

51:03.979 --> 51:05.397
No. Not this far from Memphis.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.941
Someone needs to get in there
and take their cardboard away.

51:08.024 --> 51:09.484
It's getting too congested.

51:09.568 --> 51:10.944
You heard the lady.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.153
No. I...

51:12.320 --> 51:15.073
No. Owen.
You've gotta do this.

51:15.156 --> 51:17.742
Duncan's gonna take care of it.
He's got it. Aren't you?

51:17.826 --> 51:19.411
But it's my first day.

51:19.494 --> 51:22.122
But it's your first day?
Worst-case scenario.

51:22.205 --> 51:24.958
They beat you up and you're
horribly disfigured.

51:32.507 --> 51:33.842
Hey. Look at me.

51:34.426 --> 51:36.678
You've got your shirt on now.
You're official.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.597
They're gonna listen to you.

51:44.019 --> 51:46.187
I'll be right here.
I'll step in.

52:26.561 --> 52:27.604
What the hell!

52:27.687 --> 52:28.647
I gotta take your cardboard.

52:28.730 --> 52:30.106
What did you say?

52:30.857 --> 52:32.692
I gotta take your cardboard.

52:36.529 --> 52:37.822
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

52:37.906 --> 52:40.116
You know what?
Show us your moves.

52:40.408 --> 52:43.119
You want the cardboard?
Then show us your moves.

52:43.953 --> 52:46.039
But I don't...
I can't...

52:49.918 --> 52:51.127
Come on.

52:53.296 --> 52:54.923
Let's see what you got.

53:06.935 --> 53:09.771
Okay. Okay.
That's enough.

53:09.938 --> 53:12.190
Go ahead. You can
take the cardboard.

53:12.273 --> 53:15.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. I don't think so.

53:16.111 --> 53:17.529
We are not done here.

53:17.612 --> 53:20.365
You need to show me what you got.
Let's get down.

53:20.448 --> 53:21.658
Do what I do.

53:36.172 --> 53:37.382
Nice.

53:51.938 --> 53:54.023
Hey, hey, hey!
Spin on your head!

54:00.780 --> 54:02.031
Look at that.

54:11.499 --> 54:13.168
Stick it, man! Stick it!

54:19.549 --> 54:21.718
Nice moves, Pop 'n Lock.

54:26.931 --> 54:27.974
The man's got some soul.

54:28.057 --> 54:29.392
You got lucky.

54:31.519 --> 54:36.191
<i>Live, baby, live
Now that the day is over</i>

54:38.902 --> 54:41.988
<i>I got a new sensation</i>

54:43.406 --> 54:46.159
<i>In perfect moments</i>

54:47.410 --> 54:50.622
<i>Impossible to refuse</i>

54:50.705 --> 54:52.540
Hey. Where have you been?

54:52.874 --> 54:53.875
Nowhere.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.502
That's a long time
to be nowhere.

54:55.585 --> 54:57.587
Well, that's where I was.

54:59.380 --> 55:01.508
Sorry,
this slide's out of order.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.594
It's back in order now.

55:06.054 --> 55:07.222
Hold there.

55:08.389 --> 55:09.516
Hold.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.684
Shane.

55:13.269 --> 55:14.395
Hot Rod.

55:15.396 --> 55:16.648
Pop 'n Lock!

55:19.859 --> 55:23.238
<i>Got a hold on you
A new sensation</i>

55:23.321 --> 55:26.574
<i>A new sensation Right now</i>

55:28.076 --> 55:31.663
<i>It's gonna take you over
A new sensation</i>

55:31.746 --> 55:33.623
<i>A new sensation</i>

55:34.999 --> 55:36.042
Go ahead.

55:37.544 --> 55:38.628
Hold on.

55:39.212 --> 55:40.255
Okay, go ahead.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.506
Hold please.

55:42.674 --> 55:43.967
Okay, go ahead.

55:44.425 --> 55:45.426
Hold.

55:45.844 --> 55:46.886
Now!

56:05.321 --> 56:06.406
What happened?

56:06.489 --> 56:07.532
I'm sorry. They rushed me.

56:07.615 --> 56:10.076
They said it was for
the good of science.

56:10.577 --> 56:12.412
Hey! Are you guys okay?

56:12.579 --> 56:14.998
No! We're not okay, dumb-ass!
We're stuck!

56:15.707 --> 56:17.250
Did he just call me a dumb-ass?

56:17.333 --> 56:18.376
Yeah.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.629
Not sure how I'm the dumb-ass
in this scenario.

56:21.713 --> 56:23.965
I told you we shouldn't
all go at the same time!

56:24.048 --> 56:25.466
I thought it would work!

56:25.550 --> 56:28.303
Shut up, Neil!
Shut up! Neil!

56:31.639 --> 56:33.099
Okay, listen up!

56:33.683 --> 56:34.976
I need a hero.

56:35.184 --> 56:38.146
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night.

56:38.354 --> 56:40.106
He's gotta be strong.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.191
And he's gotta be fast.

56:42.650 --> 56:45.153
And he's gotta be
fresh from the fight.

56:48.948 --> 56:51.618
Anybody? Footloose?
Bonnie Tyler song?

56:51.951 --> 56:54.078
Kevin Bacon drives a tractor
in a game of chicken?

56:54.162 --> 56:55.330
Nothing?

56:55.413 --> 56:56.581
Wow.

56:56.748 --> 56:59.334
How about the remake?
Anybody see the remake?

57:01.836 --> 57:03.838
I need someone to throw
himself down the tube

57:03.922 --> 57:06.841
and knock some kids loose.
Anybody? Any volunteers?

57:08.343 --> 57:09.427
I'll do it.

57:09.510 --> 57:10.553
Great! Come on up here.

57:10.637 --> 57:12.013
The rest of you,

57:12.096 --> 57:13.681
you're all dead to me.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.185
Hey. What's your name?

57:17.310 --> 57:18.311
Malcolm.

57:18.519 --> 57:20.519
We're gonna have to get you
going fast there, Mack.

57:20.521 --> 57:21.689
I got this.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.608
Owen, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

57:23.691 --> 57:26.444
What if we just turn off the water?
They could get their footing.

57:26.527 --> 57:27.737
Let's call that Plan B.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.141
Guys,
I'm not going to lie to you.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.573
This is probably going to hurt.

57:30.657 --> 57:32.367
What's going to hurt who?

57:34.202 --> 57:35.203
One.

57:35.286 --> 57:36.287
Two.

57:36.371 --> 57:37.789
Remember you signed a waiver.
You can't sue us.

57:37.872 --> 57:39.040
Three!

57:45.338 --> 57:46.422
What's happening?

57:46.506 --> 57:47.674
I can't see!

58:03.439 --> 58:08.277
Oh, my God! Vladimir. Ishmael, Ming Lee!
I thought I lost you!

58:12.073 --> 58:13.616
Thank God you're alive.

58:13.700 --> 58:15.034
That was awesome!

58:16.786 --> 58:17.829
You survived.

58:17.912 --> 58:20.832
Whoa. Whoa. We aren't done with this now.
Thank you.

58:20.915 --> 58:22.709
Gentlemen, no! No!

58:23.418 --> 58:24.669
What are you doing?

58:24.752 --> 58:27.463
Having fun. It's all good.
Nobody got hurt.

58:27.588 --> 58:29.757
It's not all good!
You can't do that.

58:29.841 --> 58:32.343
That is the reason that places
like this get shut down.

58:32.427 --> 58:34.595
Is it me or is she
very sexy right now?

58:34.679 --> 58:36.764
She's certainly
got my attention.

58:38.099 --> 58:39.517
You're an impressive man.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.185
I want to be you
when I grow up.

58:41.269 --> 58:43.938
I get so tired of this guy.
Aren't you tired?

58:44.022 --> 58:46.107
Aren't you sick of yourself?

58:46.524 --> 58:49.527
I'm sick of it! I'm sick
of who I am around you.

58:49.694 --> 58:52.280
I'm sick of having to be this person.
I'm not this person.

58:52.363 --> 58:53.698
I'm just messing
around with you.

58:53.781 --> 58:54.824
No!

58:54.907 --> 58:58.369
That's why this doesn't happen.

59:00.455 --> 59:02.123
This is just a job now.

59:05.001 --> 59:07.336
I wish this wasn't just a job.

59:13.384 --> 59:15.303
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

59:15.386 --> 59:17.138
It's okay.
It's my fault.

59:18.139 --> 59:19.682
Don't worry about it.

59:54.050 --> 59:56.177
The soup needs a little longer.

59:56.761 --> 59:59.806
There's a 1:30 and a 3:30.
We could see one of those.

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:05.394
Let's stay in. Do something we can
all do together. As a family.

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.313
We can see a movie as a family.

01:00:07.396 --> 01:00:10.566
We could grab Kip and Joan
and make an evening out of it.

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:13.444
I don't feel like hanging out
with Kip and Joan.

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.072
I feel like hanging
out with all of you.

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:22.203
Okay.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.128
It says appropriate
for people four to eight.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.838
So, we're good.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:36.342
What color gingerbread character
do you want to be? Trent?

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.052
Surprise me.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.140
I have to be yellow!

01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:50.690
Oh, look, you can
take the shortcut there.

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:52.608
No. He can't do that.

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:54.720
Yes, he can.
He crosses the bridge.

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:55.820
This is so stupid.

01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:57.321
No, you're at the shortcut.
So, take it.

01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:59.949
Okay. Hold on,
hold on. Okay. Here we go.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:05.705
"Shortcuts. If your playing
piece lands by exact count"

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:09.083
"on the purple space
below Gumdrop Pass,"

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.626
"then you can
take the shortcut."

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:11.961
"Exact count"

01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:13.671
He picked a card
with a blue square

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:15.673
so he has to go
to the blue square.

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.508
I don't think it matters.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:20.178
If it didn't matter, they wouldn't
put it in the directions.

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:21.846
We can fudge the rule.

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:26.809
If you're gonna play this way,
then, I'm just going like that.

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:31.689
All the way past Molasses
Swamp and I win.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.274
No rules.
I win the game.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.525
Fine. We'll play the way
you're supposed to play.

01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:36.319
Duncan, move back to
your correct place.

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:37.802
Why don't we just
play by the rules?

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:40.031
And then everybody's
gonna be happy. Okay?

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:41.407
I already did.

01:01:42.617 --> 01:01:43.868
Great.

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:46.454
Now, take my turn. I'm going
to set the table for lunch.

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:48.539
No. Wait.
You have to do it.

01:01:48.623 --> 01:01:49.707
Duncan can move for me.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.960
No. You're the one who wanted to play.
So play your turn.

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:02.136
Purple.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.142
It's two.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.230
You have to move
two purple squares.

01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:15.608
Sorry.

01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:25.868
There.

01:02:26.369 --> 01:02:29.163
And I've landed by exact
count, at the shortcut

01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:32.041
so, I am going to take
the Gumdrop Mountain Pass.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:37.838
See? You're way ahead now.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.590
It's <i>Candy Land,</i> Trent.

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:49.767
It's your turn, Steph.

01:02:57.608 --> 01:03:00.069
It's fucking <i>Candy Land!</i>

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:02.590
Hey.

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:03.716
Hey.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:05.509
What are you doing here?
It's your day off.

01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:09.638
I figured it rained yesterday,
so I thought I could make it up.

01:04:11.057 --> 01:04:12.224
Why are you?

01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:17.646
Thought I'd open the place up.
See what all the fuss is about.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.323
Your shirt's inside out.

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:33.371
Come on, how sexy
does authority look on me?

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.247
Yeah. You love it.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:39.377
So you thought
you'd just open up?

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:42.588
What're you?
Some kind of wise guy?

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:45.007
I'm still your superior.
A cup of coffee in my hand.

01:04:45.091 --> 01:04:46.133
Two minutes.

01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:47.385
Okay.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.428
We don't sell coffee.
Burn!

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.098
Yeah, we do.

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:55.101
Says you.

01:04:55.351 --> 01:04:57.853
And by the way,
we put the chairs in rows.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:02.566
I know that.

01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:04.568
It's a ten-step process.

01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:11.826
So,
this is where you run off to?

01:05:12.118 --> 01:05:13.160
Hey.

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:15.204
What are you doing here?

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:18.165
I followed you earlier.
Then went and got my stuff.

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:21.001
What happened to
"let it be yours?"

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:23.295
I held out as long as I could.

01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:24.839
It's on.
Wow.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:26.006
It's way on.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.133
Duncan.

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:29.593
Does your mom know
that you work here?

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.429
No.

01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:33.472
Nice.

01:05:33.556 --> 01:05:35.556
<i>Report to the Administrative
Offices International.</i>

01:05:35.558 --> 01:05:36.642
<i>Duncan, please report</i>

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:37.935
<i>to the Administrative
Offices International.</i>

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:39.687
<i>I have to have to
announce it over the PA</i>

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.397
<i>as my voice won't
carry that tar.</i>

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.731
<i>My throat suffered major damage</i>

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:45.151
<i>during an intense make-out
session with Lewis' mom.</i>

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:47.653
<i>She has a forked tongue
and a touch of the herpes.</i>

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:50.573
I don't have a mom. I have two dads.
In your face.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:53.993
Hold on a second.

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:58.330
<i>Please. Hurry up. This is
pressing, pressing. Urgent.</i>

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:00.791
<i>I can't tell you how pressing.
You can't fathom how pressing.</i>

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:03.711
How's it going? What's up?
Did you need something?

01:06:03.836 --> 01:06:04.920
No.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:07.548
Who's that, big guy?

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.133
Justa girl.

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:12.094
You stallion, you.

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:14.388
I don't know.
She's older than me.

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:17.725
So what are you doing
over here talking to us

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:20.895
and not over there, sealing
the deal with that cougar?

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:25.399
Well, maybe, Roddy, if you guys
hadn't called me over here.

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:30.696
<i>Return to your lady friend.</i>

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:32.656
<i>Duncan, please return
to your lady friend.</i>

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.699
<i>Please let her know</i>

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.868
<i>that this conversation
was entirety about her.</i>

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.746
<i>In other news,
this is very awkward for you.</i>

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:44.293
Water Wizz Waterpark. It was
built in the summer of '83.

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.212
The creator never wanted
the place to change.

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:47.671
So, on his deathbed, he says,

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:50.466
"I don't want this place
to be up to date or repaired."

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:52.218
"I don't even want it
brought up to code."

01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:55.262
"The minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed."

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.766
Huh. I didn't get
that joke quite as fast.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:00.935
Hey, Pop 'n Lock.

01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:03.771
That you?

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.648
Don't worry about it.

01:07:44.395 --> 01:07:46.605
Thanks a lot for
ditching me, bitch.

01:07:46.981 --> 01:07:48.732
I wasn't aware we had plans.

01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:51.151
I wasn't aware that
you two had plans.

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:52.403
I'm sorry.

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:55.948
Look. I have got a ton of stuff
going on in my life right now.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:59.285
So, it would have been nice
to have a friend.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.504
Dinner's almost ready.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.344
Bye.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.013
See you.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.948
No use in waiting.
Let's eat.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:51.211
How's Chad, Steph?

01:08:52.046 --> 01:08:53.421
We broke up.

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:56.425
Oh...

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.551
I'm sorry.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.801
What do you
want me to say? Pam?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:43.680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:46.517
It got late. I didn't call 'cause
I didn't want to wake you up.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.185
Just tell me.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:49.520
What?

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:51.063
If there's
something I should know.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:54.358
I was with Kip on his boat all day.
We lost track of the time.

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:57.361
Don't make me feel crazy.
I've been through this before.

01:09:57.444 --> 01:09:59.363
No. Just stop.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.449
Stop it. Okay?
I'm right here.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.284
Always have been.

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:10.124
We're in this together.
Remember?

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:28.684
Good morning.

01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:31.895
I hope you're hungry. I've
already made too many pancakes.

01:10:31.979 --> 01:10:33.188
Where was he?

01:10:34.606 --> 01:10:37.317
He was with Kip.
But he's here now.

01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:43.574
Good morning, buddy.

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:46.410
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't say good morning?

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:49.163
Welcome home.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:10:59.339
How about this spread, huh?

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:02.217
How did Joan find the time
to order take-out?

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:08.348
And if there's one thing that travels
really well, it's fried food.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:11.018
I must get Joan's recipe
for Big Daddy's menu.

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:12.603
Touché.

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:15.481
Hey. Is everyone
having a good time?

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:17.775
I see you got your food.
Mm-hmm.

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:19.338
Pam, I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:21.695
I should have had
you cater the party.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:25.407
Well, at least this way,
you'll have lots of leftovers.

01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:28.577
New look?

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.037
No, I just have...

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:31.955
I always do this.

01:11:32.039 --> 01:11:34.625
Mr. Ramsey, you have
been avoiding me all night.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.210
I'm not having it.
Not tonight.

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:37.294
Oh, no.

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:39.880
Out on the dance floor. Come on.
You know you want to.

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.965
Don't look so glum, everybody.

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:44.843
All right.
I'll be back.

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:52.100
Joan found
herself a victim, huh?

01:11:53.685 --> 01:11:57.397
Kip, I expect to be inviting
myself on your boat again.

01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:59.107
And when should I
plan on doing that?

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:02.903
I would like nothing more than to
get you on my boat in a bikini.

01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:06.990
But the motor's out.

01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:08.200
What?

01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:10.577
Yeah, the motor's out
and its' been out for a week.

01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:12.996
And it's gonna be another week
until I get the parts.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.249
Well,
that doesn't fit my schedule.

01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:16.917
Uh...

01:12:17.543 --> 01:12:18.669
I'm just...

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:20.754
How much more do you need?

01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:23.257
Do something, Mom!

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.092
You know what's happening.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:28.011
He's sleeping with her.
Do something about it!

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:32.766
Duncan.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.269
Yeah, that's it!
Walk away!

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:36.478
It's easier!

01:12:36.854 --> 01:12:38.522
It's right in front
of your face, Mom!

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.107
Let go of me!
I'm not talking to you.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.191
Well, I'm talking to you.

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:43.861
Just go screw her, asshole!
You already have!

01:12:43.944 --> 01:12:46.363
She's certainly not going to do
anything about it. Are you, Mom?

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.198
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:48.282 --> 01:12:50.617
Everybody knows
what I'm talking about!

01:12:50.868 --> 01:12:51.869
Really?

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:54.454
Both of you!
Stop it! Duncan!

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:55.956
Fine!

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:59.084
You don't want to do anything about it?
It's your life.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.502
It's not mine.

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:02.963
I want to be with Dad!

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:06.383
Duncan.

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.594
Your father?
Good luck with that.

01:13:09.136 --> 01:13:10.762
Hey, Trent, don't.

01:13:11.013 --> 01:13:12.764
He doesn't want you, kid.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.605
Is that true?

01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:22.316
Duncan...

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.687
I told you it sucks here.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.529
I talked to my dad today.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:13.367
I told him that we had
chased ghost crabs.

01:14:13.909 --> 01:14:15.744
It made him very happy.

01:14:16.328 --> 01:14:18.038
I felt like he was here.

01:14:20.874 --> 01:14:22.459
"Did you tell him about
the eyes, Susanna?"

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:25.045
"You've got to tell him
about their eyes!"

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:27.714
He gets so excited.

01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:35.472
See, their eyes can
rotate 360 degrees.

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.266
They can see everything
that's around them.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.268
But they can't
look straight up.

01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:42.813
Which makes it easy
for birds to attack them.

01:14:42.896 --> 01:14:46.024
So they have to gather their
food at night for safety.

01:14:49.987 --> 01:14:52.656
I don't know.
My dad finds it cool.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.491
He's a dork.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.584
Wait.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:07.170
Duncan.

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:10.674
I'm sorry.

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.270
Hey, it didn't mean anything.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:27.899
It was just a mistake.
A stupid mistake.

01:15:30.277 --> 01:15:32.404
God! I'm such an asshole!

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:36.783
Pam. Listen.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:41.288
You deserve better.
I know that.

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:44.249
I have to be better.

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:47.127
I have to be better.

01:15:48.128 --> 01:15:49.963
I'm gonna be better for you.

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.132
And for Duncan.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.968
Hey, what's up?
Where are you going?

01:15:55.052 --> 01:15:56.053
Shut up, Peter.

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:57.637
Duncan?

01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.302
Take me with you.

01:15:59.306 --> 01:16:00.390
No.

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:01.808
Please!
No.

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:04.061
Duncan.

01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:05.812
I'll scream.

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:29.044
I got it.

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.506
Or,
you could just use the gate.

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:44.851
All right, everybody, be cool.

01:16:44.935 --> 01:16:47.354
Our boss is here
with his pirate friend.

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:01.243
Hell, yeah.
I could use a cleansing ale.

01:17:01.326 --> 01:17:03.620
Or check them out from afar.

01:17:04.079 --> 01:17:05.163
I've had a beer before.

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:06.289
And I've spent
a night in jail before.

01:17:06.373 --> 01:17:07.457
But there's
a limit to everything.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:08.542
Who's your friend?

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:09.709
Peter.

01:17:10.919 --> 01:17:12.003
Nice eye patch.

01:17:12.129 --> 01:17:13.130
Thanks.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:14.297
You don't sound
too cool with it.

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:17.884
My mom makes me wear it. She
says my eye confuses people.

01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:19.719
Well now you gotta show me.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:24.141
Ha, ha!

01:17:24.224 --> 01:17:26.977
Look at that thing!
She wants you to hide that?

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.061
Is she insane?

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:29.896
I'd kill to have that eye.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.439
You're full of shit.

01:17:31.523 --> 01:17:33.150
Seriously. You know how many
bits I could do with that?

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:35.861
Daring people to look me
straight in the eye?

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.573
That thing is awesome.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:42.033
You mind if I mingle?

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:44.744
Sure. But keep your
hands in your pockets.

01:17:44.828 --> 01:17:46.454
You look a little shady to me.

01:17:46.538 --> 01:17:48.248
I'll circle back.

01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:50.667
Got a lot of confidence.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.252
Hey, man. What's up?

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:53.795
So you're having a party?

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:56.256
Yeah, we're having
a farewell for Lewis.

01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:59.426
I think he's serious this time.

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.095
Did you want to talk to me?

01:18:03.013 --> 01:18:04.931
No, I just wanted to hang out.

01:18:07.267 --> 01:18:08.518
All right.

01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:13.773
How about we say you hang out
for a little bit? Okay?

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:17.527
I'm sure you'll
be wanted at home

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.487
at some point.
You're a popular guy.

01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:40.175
Owen, you shouldn't have.

01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:41.885
I went to three
different places

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:43.553
in the water park to find that.

01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:45.972
You can use it to
catch thunderclouds.

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:48.975
Turn the music down.

01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:53.939
We need to hear a few parting
words from our guest of honor.

01:18:54.022 --> 01:18:55.023
Oh, no.

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:56.107
Yes.
No thank you.

01:18:56.191 --> 01:18:58.401
I don't want to open
myself up to some bit.

01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:00.070
You want to be
part of a tradition?

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:02.697
There's no bit here.
We're going to miss you.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:04.908
Plain and simple.

01:19:07.327 --> 01:19:09.329
I'm gonna have to sit for this.

01:19:10.747 --> 01:19:13.124
No. You don't know
where this has been.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.585
Um...

01:19:17.045 --> 01:19:21.675
Well, I won't say that I won't
miss some aspects of this place.

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.511
It wasn't completely
void of decent times.

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:28.348
I remember a couple of days
that were almost memorable.

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:36.189
I guess if there's one thing
I will miss dearly, it's...

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.693
Oh, my God!

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:41.486
What the hell, man?

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:42.650
It's part of our tradition.

01:19:42.654 --> 01:19:44.948
What kind of warped
tradition is that?

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:46.783
Lewis was pouring
his heart out!

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:49.619
I was going to say people.
I'll miss the people.

01:19:49.995 --> 01:19:51.913
Oh, my God!
Not you, Roddy!

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.792
Seriously! My doctor said
not to get water on my face!

01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.254
Oh, my God!

01:19:59.546 --> 01:20:01.631
The only thing that
could make this worse

01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:03.883
is if there were
more squirt guns.

01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:05.552
And there are!

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:14.102
<i>I remember sitting in class</i>

01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:16.479
<i>Waiting for the bell to ring</i>

01:20:16.563 --> 01:20:21.401
<i>'Cause on the playground
That's where I was king</i>

01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:23.820
<i>I jumped up real quick</i>

01:20:23.903 --> 01:20:26.906
<i>I got to be the first in line</i>

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:31.161
<i>'Cause the sun is out
And you know I'm feeling fine</i>

01:20:31.536 --> 01:20:34.331
<i>When the bell will ring</i>

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:36.541
<i>We're all gonna sing about it</i>

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:39.210
Oh!

01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:41.671
<i>My favorite swing</i>

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:43.298
<i>It's recess</i>

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:48.094
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, it's recess</i>

01:20:49.387 --> 01:20:53.224
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, it's recess</i>

01:20:54.392 --> 01:20:58.229
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, it's recess</i>

01:20:59.147 --> 01:21:02.859
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, it's recess</i>

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:26.341
You jerk.

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:28.468
That better be water.

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:29.928
It's a fun night.

01:21:30.345 --> 01:21:31.429
Yeah.

01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:35.934
I'm sorry. I'm developmentally
challenged. Like bad.

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:39.062
Nightmarey, special
episode bad. I'm sorry.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:41.481
It's all right. I was...

01:21:42.065 --> 01:21:44.150
I was a little frustrated.

01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:52.659
I just planned on being here one
summer, and now it's three years.

01:21:54.244 --> 01:21:56.079
It had a lot to do with you.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.875
I just don't want to
look back and regret

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:03.420
that it should have
only been one summer.

01:22:04.212 --> 01:22:05.296
You won't.

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:37.787
You were right.

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:40.248
We do sell coffee.

01:22:44.252 --> 01:22:46.337
I said you could hang
out for a little bit

01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:49.299
but sunrise of the next day is
where I have to draw the line.

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:50.758
You gotta go home.

01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:54.220
I wish I could
stay here forever.

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.223
You're going to love the winters.
They're pretty spectacular.

01:22:57.307 --> 01:22:59.392
Painting houses
until it gets too cold,

01:22:59.476 --> 01:23:02.479
bar backing at some dive,
talking to inanimate objects.

01:23:02.562 --> 01:23:03.813
I'm serious.

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.900
Yeah. So am I.

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:11.613
There's a whole world
out there for you, Duncan.

01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:13.448
Don't settle.

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:14.824
Not yet.

01:23:15.325 --> 01:23:17.410
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:19.078
Yeah?

01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:21.331
I bet that's not true.

01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:26.294
This is the only place
I'm happy.

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.424
What's going on?

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:35.136
I hate him.

01:23:35.303 --> 01:23:36.346
Who?

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.681
Trent.
My mom's boyfriend.

01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:41.893
He said I was a three.

01:23:42.644 --> 01:23:46.856
He asked me what I thought I was
on a scale from one to ten.

01:23:47.857 --> 01:23:49.651
He called me a three.

01:23:50.527 --> 01:23:52.695
Who says that to somebody?

01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:54.864
Somebody who doesn't know you.

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:58.451
I didn't want to have to answer!
I shouldn't have to answer!

01:23:59.244 --> 01:24:02.622
Listen to me. That's about him, man.
That's all about him.

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:04.415
It's got nothing
to do with you.

01:24:04.499 --> 01:24:06.125
Yeah? How do you know?

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:11.130
'Cause I know. Okay?
Don't worry about how I know.

01:24:13.424 --> 01:24:14.759
My dad was the same way.

01:24:14.842 --> 01:24:17.512
That's why I don't
like patterns and rules.

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:20.223
And that's why you
can't buy into that shit.

01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:22.976
You gotta go your own way.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.815
And you, my friend,
are going your own way.

01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:48.334
Mom, they're home!

01:24:48.543 --> 01:24:49.711
See you.

01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:54.674
Where the hell have you
been all night, young man!

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.050
Not now, woman.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:57.260
What did you say to me?

01:24:57.343 --> 01:24:58.636
We'll talk when I get up.
All right?

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.140
Who are you talking to, buddy?
Don't you walk away from me!

01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:05.852
Pam, he's here.

01:25:06.394 --> 01:25:07.437
Where's your eye patch?

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.563
Lost it!

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.616
We were worried
about you, buddy.

01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:24.537
Listen. Let's just forget
about last night. All right?

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:26.539
Start over. A clean slate.

01:25:26.914 --> 01:25:28.666
Sound good to you, buddy?

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:33.588
I hope you're happy now.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.094
What's going on?

01:25:40.345 --> 01:25:42.889
We're leaving.
I need you to get your stuff.

01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:44.891
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:49.604
I know.

01:25:50.688 --> 01:25:51.689
Me too.

01:25:52.732 --> 01:25:56.069
But, why do you and I have to go?
The summer's not over.

01:25:56.527 --> 01:25:57.487
Duncan.

01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:59.322
We can stay somewhere else.
I don't understand.

01:25:59.405 --> 01:26:02.241
We want to leave early,
so that's what we're doing!

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:05.036
So, we're going with them?

01:26:08.873 --> 01:26:10.958
I don't expect you
to understand.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:15.672
You're 14.

01:26:15.755 --> 01:26:19.008
And, I know that means you think
you know everything, but...

01:26:19.092 --> 01:26:20.301
We do things.

01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:24.097
We do things to

01:26:27.934 --> 01:26:30.603
protect ourselves.
Because we're...

01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:33.690
We're scared.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.068
We're leaving with them.

01:26:47.704 --> 01:26:51.082
All right.
We are good to go.

01:26:53.626 --> 01:26:54.794
Thank you.

01:26:57.255 --> 01:26:59.966
I think you are great.

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.719
You are.

01:27:05.138 --> 01:27:06.973
So, I guess.
We're leaving.

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:08.057
Goodbye.

01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:09.142
Goodbye.

01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:16.482
You just surprised
me, that's all.

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:22.488
What are you staring at, perv?

01:27:22.572 --> 01:27:27.994
<i>They'd laugh
and dance like fools</i>

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:34.500
<i>If they only knew</i>

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:38.421
<i>Souls cannot</i>

01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:43.009
<i>Be fumed</i>

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:50.767
<i>Power hungry animals</i>

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:56.522
<i>Let 'em eat if they want to</i>

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:05.406
<i>Let my soul now rest in peace</i>

01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:11.120
<i>Because I know the one
who holds the truth</i>

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:18.669
<i>If they only knew</i>

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:25.676
<i>That life ain't dance
like fools</i>

01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:32.934
<i>If they only knew</i>

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:37.313
<i>That souls cannot</i>

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:40.483
<i>Souls cannot be fooled</i>

01:28:41.067 --> 01:28:44.278
<i>Souls cannot</i>

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:47.573
<i>Souls cannot be fooled</i>

01:28:48.074 --> 01:28:51.410
<i>Souls cannot</i>

01:28:51.869 --> 01:28:53.329
<i>Souls cannot be fooled</i>

01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:54.539
Duncan!

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:58.584
<i>Souls cannot</i>

01:28:58.835 --> 01:29:01.921
<i>Souls cannot be fooled</i>

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.047
Pam!

01:29:04.799 --> 01:29:06.008
Pam!

01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:09.929
<i>Souls cannot be fooled</i>

01:29:16.853 --> 01:29:18.062
We're leaving!

01:29:18.145 --> 01:29:19.313
What?

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:21.440
I came to say goodbye.
Come on.

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:38.666
I'm doing it, Hot Rod.
I'm gonna pass him.

01:29:40.001 --> 01:29:41.335
What?

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.130
Duncan, what's going on?

01:29:44.672 --> 01:29:46.382
Pop 'n Lock's going for it!

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:48.968
He's gonna try to
pass Owen on the slide!

01:29:50.553 --> 01:29:53.514
<i>Attention Water Wizz patrons.
Although I don't condone it,</i>

01:29:53.598 --> 01:29:55.600
<i>apparently, our fellow
employee, Pop 'n Lock</i>

01:29:55.683 --> 01:29:58.519
<i>is attempting to pass someone
on Devil's Peak.</i>

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:01.480
<i>Of course, at his own risk,
at no liability for us.</i>

01:30:02.023 --> 01:30:04.025
<i>That said. I plan to watch.</i>

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.158
What are we doing?

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:17.246
Where are we going?

01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:18.372
I don't know.

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:20.819
<i>So, how are you
planning to do it?</i>

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:22.251
I don't know.

01:30:22.335 --> 01:30:24.253
What makes you think you can?

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:27.173
Don't die wondering, man.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:32.511
All right, you go first.
I'll follow right behind you.

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:38.184
This is my good shirt.
Don't steal it.

01:30:40.186 --> 01:30:41.437
One...

01:30:41.896 --> 01:30:42.939
Two...

01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:44.190
Three...

01:30:44.357 --> 01:30:45.691
Go!

01:31:39.578 --> 01:31:40.871
How'd you do it?

01:31:40.955 --> 01:31:42.957
Can't tell you.
That's a secret.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:45.001
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first person

01:31:45.084 --> 01:31:47.503
to ever pass someone
on the water slide!

01:31:56.846 --> 01:31:58.180
Mom.

01:31:58.806 --> 01:32:01.100
This is Owen,
my friend who can drive.

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:02.393
Owen, this is my mom.

01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:03.853
This is your mom?

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:06.022
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:32:06.105 --> 01:32:07.398
Yeah, you too.

01:32:08.941 --> 01:32:10.985
You've got
a hell of a kid here.

01:32:11.485 --> 01:32:12.778
Hell of a kid.

01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:16.782
Are we done?

01:32:17.158 --> 01:32:18.576
You must be Trent.

01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:21.746
I'm Owen,
a good friend of "the three."

01:32:22.997 --> 01:32:24.415
Come on. Let's go.

01:32:28.127 --> 01:32:29.670
I'll be in the car.

01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:35.301
Hey, Mom,
can you give us a minute?

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:38.929
Mom?

01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:40.347
Oh, yeah.

01:32:41.307 --> 01:32:42.433
Of course.

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:48.814
Bye, Roddy.

01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:50.274
Pop 'n Lock.

01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:52.026
Bye, Caitlin.

01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:54.487
Take care, Duncan.
We're gonna miss you.

01:32:57.823 --> 01:32:59.867
Yes, I'm still here. Bye.

01:33:00.493 --> 01:33:01.744
Goodbye, Lewis.

01:33:01.827 --> 01:33:02.953
Bye.

01:33:03.454 --> 01:33:04.830
Bye, Lewis.

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:17.468
Well,

01:33:19.053 --> 01:33:20.596
faster conversations.

01:33:32.483 --> 01:33:33.692
Thank you.

01:33:34.193 --> 01:33:35.820
For everything.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:46.163
<i>But in between It's you and me</i>

01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:49.875
<i>Oh</i>

01:33:54.338 --> 01:33:56.090
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:01.262 --> 01:34:03.389
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:10.479
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:17.361
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:28.038 --> 01:34:29.540
Hey, come on.

01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:34.044
What the hell, Pam!
Come on!

01:34:34.128 --> 01:34:35.754
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:43.262
<i>Oh</i>

01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:49.977
<i>Oh</i>

as a breeze</i>
