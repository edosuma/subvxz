WEBVTT

00:09.540 --> 00:11.531
*

00:35.360 --> 00:37.499
12 years I've lived in the city,
I'd never been to Belmont.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.088
Now I see
why you love the horses.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.368
That was incredible.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.799
And Eliot thinks I'm
the gambling addict.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.569
Oh, very funny.
So, you free Tuesday?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.237
To go back to Belmont?

00:45.270 --> 00:47.079
Yeah, I just need help
remembering all the tips we got.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.600
Like that woman
I was talking to.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.641
She gave me a tip
on a trifecta,

00:49.680 --> 00:51.648
but I forgot the three horses
I'm supposed to box.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.614
To box? You know,
they have these

00:53.650 --> 00:54.810
support groups for gambling
addicts, and you...

00:54.850 --> 00:57.580
What? You're the only one who
can enjoy an adrenaline rush?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.281
No, it's just that
my adrenaline rush

00:59.320 --> 01:01.151
is based on winning money
on the horses.

01:01.190 --> 01:05.581
Yours is more connected to, um,
the blonde who gave you tips.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.690
Not true. Are you gonna give me
the names of the horses or not?

01:08.730 --> 01:11.164
Because I know you remember 'em.
I remember all 12
horses In the race

01:11.200 --> 01:12.838
and the three you
were supposed to box.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.134
I also remember five reasons
why you can't remember.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.730
Blonde hair, pouty
lips, short skirt,

01:17.770 --> 01:19.806
six-inch stilettos
and a giant...

01:19.840 --> 01:21.831
Your point is?

01:21.880 --> 01:24.542
I'm not going back to
Belmont with you on Tuesday.
Oh, come on. Why not?

01:24.580 --> 01:26.218
Because it violates my
first rule of gambling.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.673
Never accept a tip from a blonde
in six

01:28.720 --> 01:30.642
No, that's my second.
My first is:

01:30.690 --> 01:33.181
only go to the track when
the horses are actually there.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.858
Belmont is closed on Tuesdays.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.654
Mm. I see.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.164
Lieutenant Al Burns?
Yup.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.521
Captain Melvin Stearns,
Internal Affairs.

01:45.570 --> 01:47.197
What can I do
for you, Captain?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.832
You know a guy
named Oscar Payn?

01:48.870 --> 01:52.670
Sure. I colla_red him for intent
to sell five years ago.

01:52.710 --> 01:53.699
ELIOT:
Stearns,

01:53.740 --> 01:55.298
what's going on here?

01:55.340 --> 01:58.275
You aware he's been out
on parole the last snx weeks?

01:58.310 --> 01:59.846
Good for him.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.541
Not so good.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.548
Someone put a bullet
in his brain.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.787
And as of now, we have reason to
believe that someone to be you.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.789
Lieutenant Burns,
you are placed

02:10.830 --> 02:13.390
on modified assignment
and relegated to desk duty

02:13.430 --> 02:15.455
till our investigation
into the murder of Oscar Payn

02:15.500 --> 02:17.559
determines your guilt
or innocence.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.138
May I have your gun and
your shield, please?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.169
Lieutenant?

02:57.510 --> 03:01.401
You know the rules, Melvin.
Any action against my team,

03:01.440 --> 03:03.374
you notify me personally
in advance.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.741
Don't blame me if you don't know
what's going on with your team.

03:04.780 --> 03:05.872
What's that supposed to mean?

03:05.910 --> 03:07.719
Maybe the board
should have installed

03:07.750 --> 03:09.217
an actual police officer

03:09.250 --> 03:10.581
to run Major Crimes
instead of a...

03:10.620 --> 03:12.508
What are you again?

03:12.560 --> 03:13.686
Oh, I know. I know, Melvin.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.483
You wanted this job.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.329
I know how hard
you tried to get it.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.588
Sure, some may have felt

03:18.630 --> 03:22.919
that fixing parking tickets for
the mayor's niece was pandering,

03:22.970 --> 03:25.495
but I for one
applauded your initiative.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.294
Do not take

03:28.340 --> 03:29.568
our history out

03:29.610 --> 03:30.838
on members of my team,

03:30.870 --> 03:33.430
or I will see to it
that you regret It.

03:33.480 --> 03:38.804
Lieutenant Burns is a decorated
officer With a spotless record.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.511
We wouldn't have
moved against Burns

03:40.550 --> 03:41.676
if we didn't have
sufficient evidence.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.382
We have a positive
ballistics match

03:44.420 --> 03:45.648
to Burns' service _
weapon and a case file

03:45.690 --> 03:47.510
of other evidence
I have neither the need

03:47.560 --> 03:48.857
_ nor the interest
In sharing With you.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.528
Ballistics match?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.448
Perhaps you haven't heard,
Eliot,

03:52.500 --> 03:55.298
but every weapon fired
has a distinctive signature.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.697
Yeah, yeah. So?

03:58.730 --> 04:01.836
So, Oscar Payn was killed by
Burns' Sig Sauer service handgun

04:01.870 --> 04:04.361
to the exclusion
of any other weapon.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.332
It is an absolute fact.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.440
This is a matter
for Internal Affairs now.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.811
I get even a hint that

04:13.850 --> 04:15.545
your Major Crimes guys
are sniffing around,

04:15.580 --> 04:17.787
I will terminate them
from this department.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.794
Al, what you doing?

04:26.830 --> 04:28.695
Just getting my coffee.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.563
Jay's got this nice Sumatra with
chocolate notes or something.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.966
Wow, you are
extraordinarily calm.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.537
Considering I want to put
my fist through that guy's face?

04:36.570 --> 04:38.458
That I just went through
the most humiliating moment

04:38.510 --> 04:40.535
of my career, maybe my life?

04:40.580 --> 04:41.706
Yeah, considering that.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.506
Listen, we're gonna be fine.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.519
If I wanted to whack a guy,
why would I use my own gun?

04:48.550 --> 04:50.040
This is all a mistake.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.012
I think
it might all be political.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.518
IAB is only looking at you.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.551
They are not pursuing
any other leads.

04:56.590 --> 04:59.354
I put in a call to Beth Bronson,
the LBA attorney.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.927
She's requested an independent
ballistics analysis of my gun.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.426
Who is Oscar Payn?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.529
A scumbag.

05:06.570 --> 05:10.108
Payn was running an operation
out of Corona,

05:10.140 --> 05:12.108
the Tumbling Sixes.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.802
The 117 picked up intel
that Payn was taking in

05:14.840 --> 05:16.671
a major heroin shipment.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.076
I got together a team
to take him down.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.112
Turned out, there was
an eight-year-old

05:21.150 --> 05:23.710
girl inside there-- hostage.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.684
And we got her out,

05:25.720 --> 05:27.881
but we lost someone
in the firefight.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.751
A young officer.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.985
And what about Payn?

05:32.030 --> 05:34.919
He beat the murder charge
on a technicality.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.758
Was still put away
for possession with intent.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.098
But he and his partner rolled
on a couple of their own guys,

05:40.140 --> 05:42.563
and got reduced sentences.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.669
Payn's guys hated Payn,
and they hate you.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.928
You're being framed.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.629
We were at the races
the day Payn got murdered.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.147
Where were you that night?

05:50.180 --> 05:52.068
Midnight?
Midnight, I was asleep.

05:52.110 --> 05:54.647
All right, what about your gun?
On my night table.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.614
Not the world's best alibi.

05:56.650 --> 05:57.617
No.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.017
Listen, you stay out of this.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.585
These IAB guys are nightmares.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.985
They'll get you
jammed up or fired.

06:06.030 --> 06:10.820
Trust me, the ballistics test
will clear me.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.599
I'm gonna clear you,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.564
because I'm gonna find out
who killed Oscar Payn.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.601
CARRIE: Do I even
want to know how

06:20.640 --> 06:22.005
you got your hands on these?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.678
All I can say is

06:23.710 --> 06:25.803
a highly-classified Bundt
cake recipe was involved.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.647
Hmm.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.476
Jo?
Hmm?

06:28.520 --> 06:29.839
I could get fired
for what I'm doing,

06:29.890 --> 06:32.085
and I don't want_to_
get you mixed up in it.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.883
Oh, no. I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.911
I'm the Dirty Harry of M.E.s.

06:36.990 --> 06:39.049
Mm.
How close is the match?

06:39.090 --> 06:40.728
Well, I'm not
a ballistics expert.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.024
From what I can tell,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.697
pretty darn close.

06:46.670 --> 06:47.967
Well, Al's getting the gun
tested independently, so...

06:48.000 --> 06:48.967
Fingers crossed.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.809
Take a look
at this, hmm?

06:51.770 --> 06:53.738
Single round
penetrated Payn's skull

06:53.780 --> 06:55.736
precisely dead center.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.044
In other words, right
between the eyes.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.809
From ten yards.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.148
Which means our shooter knew
their way around a gun.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.647
Uh-huh.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.021
CARRIE:
Eliot,

07:10.060 --> 07:11.652
what is this?

07:11.690 --> 07:12.850
Melvin Stearns' attempt
to humiliate me.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.629
Son of a bitch
wants to show me up

07:14.660 --> 07:16.196
in front of my own people.

07:16.230 --> 07:19.597
Look, I know you've kept it
in between the lines so far.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.528
And both of us know Stearns
is waiting for us to over...

07:21.570 --> 07:23.128
Are you gonna
tell me to stop?
God, no.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.161
I'm asking you
to be careful.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.739
Where's Al?

07:30.780 --> 07:32.247
These goons showed up,
confiscated his computer,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.578
and announced they were
interviewing all of us.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.917
Hmm.
He took off.

07:35.950 --> 07:38.748
Oh, hey, I might have
something for you.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.156
I dug into Payn's gang, the
Tumbling Sixes, and I may have

07:41.190 --> 07:42.748
found something
interesting.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.189
Take a look.
Once Payn got out,

07:44.230 --> 07:46.084
things went south
with his wife Alma.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.223
Apparently, he thought
she was cheating on him.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.160
His parole officer
thinks it could have been

07:50.200 --> 07:52.168
with his old partner
Hector Griego.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.532
Griego got out of jail
four months

07:54.570 --> 07:56.162
before Payn.
And guess what?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.930
He's a vet,
weapons-trained in Afghanistan.

07:58.970 --> 08:01.234
If Hector Griego was
sleeping with Payn's wife,

08:01.280 --> 08:04.169
then we have a suspect
that has a grudge against Al

08:04.210 --> 08:06.144
and wanted Payn out of the way.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.772
And was a damn
good shot.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.139
Now, there's no
last known address.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.182
We don't know where he is.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.654
Well, I'll bet Alma Payn knows
where he is. Head over there.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.656
Listen, Beth,
I'll take a polygraph.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.521
Al, I've told you, that's
not admissible in court.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.858
Well, it's got to mean something
if I offer to take the test.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.219
The problem is,
you take the poly,

08:23.270 --> 08:25.192
they can ask you questions
you don't want to answer.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.767
For example, "Are you upset
Oscar Payn took a bullet

08:27.800 --> 08:30.303
between the eyes?"

08:30.340 --> 08:32.706
Look, I know
this is hard,

08:32.740 --> 08:34.879
but you've got to
trust me and just relax.

08:34.910 --> 08:38.698
Relax? You try to relax with IAB
guys camped out at Major Crimes

08:38.750 --> 08:39.819
right on top of you.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.272
I know.
Would you just stay cool.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.787
Stearns is trying
to bait you,

08:42.820 --> 08:44.139
hope you'll take a swing
at one of them

08:44.190 --> 08:45.839
and give them a reason
to send you to Rikers.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.915
They're up there
questioning my team.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.550
All right, thank you.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.228
Call me the second
the test comes in.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.852
All right.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.259
MAN:
Detective Margolis?

09:02.300 --> 09:04.063
Sharon Margolis?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.202
Detective Lee,

09:05.240 --> 09:06.730
you'll be next.

09:12.950 --> 09:13.917
Hey, you okay?

09:13.950 --> 09:14.917
AL:
Yeah.

09:14.950 --> 09:15.974
I just couldn't watch Stearns

09:16.020 --> 09:17.248
walking all over my life.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.746
Murray's got a lead.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.314
Payn's old pal Hector Griego.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.418
Looks like he was sleeping
with Payn's wife

09:21.460 --> 09:23.928
while he was in jail.
Murray's heading out there.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.120
Carrie, thanks,

09:25.160 --> 09:27.094
but you guys got to remember,
this is Internal Affairs.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.097
If you're gonna tell me

09:28.130 --> 09:29.097
to be careful,

09:29.130 --> 09:30.859
I'm gonna tell you to shut it.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.098
Hey, Carrie.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.960
Can we talk?

09:39.010 --> 09:40.238
Sure.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.929
What's up?

09:41.980 --> 09:44.972
Uh... listen.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.717
I was grabbing a beer
with Al about a month ago.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.843
He was talking
about the Payn case.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.289
He knew Payn was out of prison?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.686
And he was _
really steamed about it.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.982
He told me...

09:56.360 --> 09:59.796
He told me he wished
that somebody

09:59.830 --> 10:01.627
would wipe that guy
off the map.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.820
Al's words, not mine.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.292
If IAB finds out about this...

10:04.330 --> 10:05.729
Did anyone else overhear this?

10:05.770 --> 10:08.694
We were in a bar
with a lot of cops.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.901
Carrie, how do
I play this with IAB?

10:10.940 --> 10:14.273
If they catch me lying...
I'm toast.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.335
You do whatever
you have to do, Jay.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.911
WOMAN:
I don't understand.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.212
I-I told the police

10:23.250 --> 10:25.138
everything I know about
what happened to Oscar.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.055
And you've been very
helpful, Mrs. Payn.

10:27.090 --> 10:29.308
I just have a couple more
questions, if that's okay.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.679
Yes, of course.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.698
If you don't
mind me asking,

10:32.730 --> 10:34.197
how much you pay
a month for this place?

10:34.230 --> 10:35.822
I...

10:35.860 --> 10:37.191
I don't know.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.323
Like, $2,250, maybe?
That about right?

10:39.370 --> 10:41.838
That's $27,000
a year.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.759
Last year, you reported
a part-time income

10:44.810 --> 10:46.232
of $30,000.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.738
Now, that leaves
$3,000 a year

10:48.780 --> 10:49.872
for food and clothing.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.878
Wow, those amazing

10:51.910 --> 10:54.777
$600 Manolo Blahniks
you're wearing.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.038
Were they a gift
from Hector Griego?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.081
Hector?
Mm-hmm.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.951
No, I...
Alma.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.026
Hector got out before Oscar.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.982
You've been seeing him while
your husband was inside, right?

11:05.030 --> 11:07.851
How do you know that?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.151
We know everything.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.861
Except where Hector is.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.936
You don't think Hector

11:12.970 --> 11:15.131
had anything to do with
killing Oscar, do you?

11:15.170 --> 11:16.762
Where is he?

11:16.810 --> 11:19.131
Hect_or is clean now.
He is a good man.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.831
Alma.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.008
I used to work as an
investigator for the IRS.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.405
And they don't much care
for unreported income.

11:26.450 --> 11:29.988
I make a call, believe me,
they will take those shoes.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.011
They will take
this house.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.154
So why don't you just
tell me where he is.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.387
He's staying with a friend.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.127
623 Ryder Avenue.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.059
Four blocks from where
your husband was murdered.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.372
Hector.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.038
Carrie Wells, NYPD.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.002
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.110
I'm guessing
this is about Oscar.
Yeah.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.038
I'm happy to talk, but I don't
know what happened to him.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.978
I'm a machinist now.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.817
Got a good job.
Not bangin' no more.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.511
Except for Oscar's wife
Alma, right?

12:09.560 --> 12:11.221
Excuse me, what'd you say?

12:11.260 --> 12:13.751
Hold up. I want
your badge number

12:13.800 --> 12:15.097
and the name of your
commanding officer.

12:15.130 --> 12:16.927
I'm gonna report you.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.097
WEBSTER: Single round
penetrated Payn's skull

12:19.130 --> 12:21.837
precisely dead center.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.930
You were the last one
to see him alive, weren't you?

12:24.970 --> 12:26.232
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:26.270 --> 12:28.431
Heilbronn. The beer.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.199
You had a beer with him
that night, didn't you?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.775
I think you called him up,
you invited him for a beer,

12:33.820 --> 12:36.118
pretended to be his friend
and then you killed him.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.845
That way, you and Alma
can be together,

12:37.890 --> 12:39.118
and your buddy's not around--
how convenient.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.287
I didn't kill him!

12:41.460 --> 12:44.020
Okay, Oscar came
over for a beer.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.459
But he left around 11:30.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.957
That was the last
time I saw him.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.820
Can anyone back up your story?

12:48.860 --> 12:50.964
Yeah, once he left,
I called Alma.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.298
We were on the phone
for, like, over an hour.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.262
We were trying to decide
how to come clean to him.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.860
Honest. Ask Alma.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.935
Alma was married to Oscar,
cheating with you.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.174
She's not an alibi.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.098
I was here, I swear.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.401
Look, you can track my phone

13:04.450 --> 13:07.044
with that satellite stuff
you guys got, right?

13:07.080 --> 13:10.049
You'll see I'm being straight.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.856
Jay, I need you to look
into Hector Griego.

13:15.890 --> 13:18.188
Phone calls, credit cards-- all
his movements for the last week

13:18.230 --> 13:19.993
leading up to the murder.

13:20.030 --> 13:20.951
Carrie, we got
a big problem.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.127
The independent ballistics
report came in.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.491
And it is the same
as the NYPD lab.

13:25.530 --> 13:28.431
Striations on the round,
strike mark on the primer.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.131
There is no doubt
about it, Carrie.

13:30.170 --> 13:33.037
Al's gun was used
to kill Oscar Payn.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.878
So, we look into Hector Griego,
we find out who took Al's gun,

13:35.910 --> 13:36.899
how they got it...

13:36.950 --> 13:39.077
They arrested him, Carrie.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.418
They arrested Al.

13:47.190 --> 13:50.182
Lieutenant Burns,
was it really your gun?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.083
Where is he?

13:51.130 --> 13:52.085
They're processing him

13:52.130 --> 13:52.949
in Rikers right now.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.472
I'm gonna do your thumb.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.845
And your forefingers.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.155
It's got a little alcohol pad
you can use there, Lieutenant.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.851
Danny, look at me.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.188
I know the drill.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.429
Hey.

14:39.470 --> 14:40.437
How's he doing?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.970
As well as can be expected.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.944
I updated him on everything,
but the D.A.'s office

14:43.980 --> 14:45.379
has thrown in a monkey wrench.

14:45.410 --> 14:46.445
A plea deal.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.141
25 years.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.045
If Al turns us down,
we go to trial

14:50.090 --> 14:51.318
and he's looking at life.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.510
He's got 48 hours
to decide.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.415
Al's not gonna plead out.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.087
The DA says she has Al
threatening Payn's life.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.087
Is that true?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.655
Doesn't sound like Al.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.158
Well, it may not sound like him,
but with ballistics,

15:02.200 --> 15:04.191
Al's history with Payn
and this new information,

15:04.230 --> 15:06.323
I do not have
a lot to work with.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.292
GUARD:
On the line. Eyes forward.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.329
Mouth shut.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.329
Not bangin' no more.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.143
Does Al have protective custody?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.647
No. Not yet.
You need to get it for him.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.478
You understand me?
You need to get it for him now.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.148
AL: Tumbling Sixes?
That's impossible.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.384
I know what I saw.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.012
If you're gonna tell me
to be careful,

15:28.060 --> 15:29.459
you shut it.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.358
My gun

15:32.390 --> 15:33.994
It must've been out of your
possession at some point.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.190
It's with me at all times.
I told you that.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.197
Well, not at night.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.219
You don't sleep with it.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.498
This I know.

15:38.530 --> 15:41.067
Although there was
that one time.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.504
It's on my night table at home.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.531
It's in my locker
when I go to the gym.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.048
The only two times
it's not on me.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.274
Could you have had

15:51.310 --> 15:53.346
a tech check it
or had it cleaned?

15:53.380 --> 15:54.745
I do all that myself.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.418
Breakdown, cleaning.

16:04.490 --> 16:07.391
When was the last time you
qualified at the gun range?

16:07.430 --> 16:08.692
Like, a week ago.

16:08.730 --> 16:09.799
And did you check your
personal weapon, too?

16:09.830 --> 16:14.096
Yeah, I leave my service piece
with the range officer.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.406
But the range, the locker room--
that's all cops.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.408
If someone switched out_the
weapon and replaced it

16:20.440 --> 16:22.476
in your locker,
you would never know.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.546
Why couldn't it be a cop?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.400
What cop would do that?

16:26.450 --> 16:30.511
One that has a grudge
against you and Oscar Payn.

16:33.420 --> 16:34.409
What?

16:34.460 --> 16:39.227
The officer who was killed
when we took down Payn--

16:39.260 --> 16:41.490
her name was Melissa Quinn.

16:41.530 --> 16:44.465
As in Captain Vincent Quinn?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.161
That's her father.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.465
She also had a grandfather
who won two medals for valor.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.536
Not to mention
her brother Brendan,

16:51.570 --> 16:53.470
another hero_
currently on the job.

16:53.510 --> 16:56.070
But framing people
and murdering,

16:56.110 --> 16:57.509
that is not the Quinn way.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.040
They are cops.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.048
They know their way
around that gun range.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.570
They have access
to the locker room,

17:02.620 --> 17:06.147
motive, means, opportunity.

17:06.190 --> 17:09.614
Did they blame you
for Melissa's death?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.750
I tried to contact them.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.553
They wouldn't talk to me.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.626
They were mourning
the loss of their daughter.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.797
But they're a cop family.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.569
They know
the rules of the job.

17:24.610 --> 17:27.374
This is about a father
and his little girl.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.478
What happened that night?

17:30.510 --> 17:32.671
The night
she was killed.

17:35.650 --> 17:39.518
Melissa was a real...
go-getter.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.780
Was always trying to prove
she was one of the family.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.653
The Mighty Quinns.

17:44.690 --> 17:48.592
We were waiting on ESU.

17:48.630 --> 17:52.293
I gave the order to hold.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.366
She went in anyway.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.460
That little girl...

17:57.510 --> 17:59.501
Did you tell them

17:59.540 --> 18:01.531
that she disobeyed
a direct order

18:01.580 --> 18:03.138
and that's what
got her killed?

18:04.510 --> 18:06.546
I wanted to protect her memory.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.242
She comes from cop royalty.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.252
They needed to remember her
as a hero.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.359
I'm going to talk
to Vincent Quinn.

18:14.390 --> 18:15.311
You shouldn't do that.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.658
You don't know how connected
those people are.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.351
They don't scare me.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.551
They should.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.688
Detective Wells,
I've been expecting you.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.129
Captain Quinn, I'm here to...
I know.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.899
You think my family
framed your partner.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.578
What makes you say that?

18:34.610 --> 18:36.601
Because it would be
the angle I'd work.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.585
Melissa's shield.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.589
Mm-hmm. Do you have
children, Detective?

18:46.620 --> 18:49.919
No.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.691
Then you can't understand
what that loss is like.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.858
Bad as it was, it wouldn't
lead us to do what you think.

18:56.900 --> 19:00.290
What would you do
if you were me?

19:00.340 --> 19:03.503
I'd make sure I knew my partner
as well as I thought I did.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.201
I know Al.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.502
And I know my family.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.474
You're chasing the wrong lead.

19:08.510 --> 19:09.670
So you won't mind me
talking to them then?

19:09.710 --> 19:11.371
I would ask that
you respect the fact

19:11.410 --> 19:12.946
that we've been
through enough.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.414
We don't talk
about Melissa.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.543
We don't speak your
partner's name.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.787
And we certainly don't discuss
the criminal who murdered her.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.856
I understand.

19:22.890 --> 19:25.552
And I do respect
what you've been through,

19:25.590 --> 19:29.219
but as strongly as you feel
about your family,

19:29.260 --> 19:30.818
I feel about my partner.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.361
And I know he did not
murder Oscar Payn.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.765
I know it.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.235
Hey.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.534
Hey. How'd your meeting
with IAB go?

19:41.580 --> 19:42.638
It went good.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.705
Good for you or good for Al?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.900
What are you saying?
You said you heard

19:46.950 --> 19:49.339
Al threatening Payn's life;
now, miraculously,

19:49.380 --> 19:52.349
the DA. has Al
threatening Payn's life.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.687
I didn't say a word.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.654
Now, I know you're
under a lot of pressure here,

19:55.690 --> 19:57.419
but you're not the only one
in Al's corner.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.529
You should know that.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.824
Look.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.397
Asking my opinion,
guy deserves life.

20:03.430 --> 20:04.522
What is this?

20:04.570 --> 20:05.764
Some reporter caught up with Al

20:05.800 --> 20:06.698
when Oscar Payn was sentenced

20:06.730 --> 20:08.459
five years ago.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.604
I'm not gonna shed any tears
if he dies in prison.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.562
He's safer there,
I'll tell you that.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.578
Carrie, if a jury sees this...

20:15.780 --> 20:17.645
I'm sorry, Jay.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.542
I'm sorry.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.717
All right, the Quinns.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.615
Got anything on them?

20:23.650 --> 20:24.685
Now, you're not gonna
believe this, Carrie,

20:24.720 --> 20:26.642
but Brendan Quinn,
Melissa's brother--

20:26.690 --> 20:28.612
not only does he work
at Barrett Road,

20:28.660 --> 20:31.629
he was on duty at the gun range
last Wednesday.

20:31.660 --> 20:32.786
Same day Al was there.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.798
That's fantastic.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.706
GUARD:
Hold it right there.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.038
To your right.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.048
Eyes forward.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.274
On the lock in.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.004
GUARD:
On the floor! On the floor!

21:51.040 --> 21:53.406
Stand down! No, no!
On the floor!

21:55.680 --> 21:58.899
Let's go. Let's go.
Stop fighting.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.119
I count 13

22:11.160 --> 22:12.627
out of 15, Detective.
Nice work.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.753
Actually, one round
went through a hole

22:14.800 --> 22:15.994
I already made.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.828
IfI had a buck
for every time I heard...

22:18.870 --> 22:20.929
14 out of 15 then.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.835
Yeah.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.132
Hey, is Brendan Quinn
here today?

22:24.170 --> 22:25.364
He said I should

22:25.410 --> 22:26.604
stop by and say hi.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.403
I'm sure he's
in the range shack.
Oh.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.476
I still got to check
that double. No offense.

22:30.510 --> 22:31.670
None taken.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.380
Hello?

22:57.910 --> 22:59.935
Hi.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.938
My father told me
to expect you.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.129
But this is pretty damn bold.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.148
Sneaking around my office.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.102
Well, if you just point me in
the direction of Rudy Vernon,

23:07.150 --> 23:08.617
I'll get out of your hair.

23:08.650 --> 23:09.776
I don't know.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.879
He didn't come in today.
What do you care?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.854
You and Rudy were both working
when Al Burns qualified,

23:13.890 --> 23:14.914
weren't you?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.757
If you say so. So what?

23:16.790 --> 23:19.429
And Rudy was the range officer
that inspected Al's gun.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.428
Again... so what?

23:21.460 --> 23:24.429
Where were you the night
Oscar Payn was murdered?

23:24.470 --> 23:27.837
I was with my sister Kathleen.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.895
Now get the hell out.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.066
I'm not gonna stop.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.964
Oh, I'm afraid.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.637
I'm very afraid.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.002
JAY:
I'm all over Brendan Quinn's

23:39.050 --> 23:40.108
credit cards, ATM--

23:40.150 --> 23:42.175
anything that can place him
near the Payn murder.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.710
Also looking
for his sister's address.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.980
What do you have on Rudy Vernon?

23:46.020 --> 23:48.909
Not much. He's got a pretty
standard record on the force.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.621
Now, according
to his bank records,

23:50.660 --> 23:53.458
he's about three months
behind on his mortgage.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.058
Well, maybe if I make it
sweet enough for him,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.158
he'll flip
on his friend Brendan.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.929
Good idea. You need an address?

23:57.970 --> 24:00.165
How is 428 Brickenhoff?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.929
Damn, you're good.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.608
I bet you you're there already,
ain't you?

24:03.640 --> 24:04.868
No way. In fact,

24:04.910 --> 24:07.162
I'm on the other side of town.

24:07.210 --> 24:10.008
I got to go.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.559
MAN:
911. What's your emergency?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.090
Officer down.
428 Brickenhoff.

24:30.130 --> 24:32.121
You need to send somebody now.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.839
Well, hello, fellas.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.802
What'd they get you for, Eliot?
You know, I told him

24:43.850 --> 24:46.273
not to flush paper towels;
it's right there on the sign.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.744
You're interfering
with an IAB investigation.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.213
An investigation or a frame job?

24:50.250 --> 24:51.979
Vincent Quinn and I
go way back.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.056
Apparently, you were
harassing his son.

24:54.090 --> 24:57.059
What? Two consenting adults

24:57.090 --> 24:58.853
_ can't have _
a Simple conversation?

24:58.890 --> 25:01.097
Not if it pertains
to this case.

25:01.130 --> 25:03.928
Detective Wells,
you're suspended.

25:06.070 --> 25:09.665
Someone murdered Rudy Vernon
to clean up a mess,

25:09.700 --> 25:12.066
and it wasn't Al,
so who the hell was it?

25:12.110 --> 25:13.998
Detective Wells,
I'm gonna need your shield

25:14.040 --> 25:15.871
and your service weapon.

25:15.910 --> 25:17.707
As of this moment,
you are indeed suspended.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.705
What?

25:18.750 --> 25:19.944
Indefinitely.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.853
Your gun and your shield,
Detective.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.157
You can't do this.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.088
I warned you.

25:37.130 --> 25:40.634
Your gun and your shield,
Detective.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.661
Sure.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.099
You should confer
With a union attorney

25:51.150 --> 25:53.641
to prepare yourself for an
expulsion trial date forthwith.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.079
"Forthwith"?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.747
What? No desk
duty for me?

25:56.780 --> 25:58.179
No.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.347
You're bad for morale.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.085
And you're
a disruptive presence.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.054
And I want you out of here now.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.053
Coward.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.069
That was quite
the performance.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.146
Oh, you should've seen
my Willy Loman.

26:29.180 --> 26:31.216
Roslyn High School.
Hmm.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.378
Great fun, except
for that bald cap.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.082
I still can't stand
the smell of spirit gum.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.985
Listen, we're running
out of time.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.224
Al was almost
shanked last night.

26:40.260 --> 26:41.352
One of the
Tumbling Sixes.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.549
I knew this was gonna happen.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.898
We have got to get him out
of there before they kill him.

26:44.930 --> 26:45.897
We will.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.659
I am going to keep IAB

26:47.700 --> 26:49.167
as contained as I can. You?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.838
You go suspend yourself.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.235
Get to work.

26:52.270 --> 26:53.828
Yes, sir.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.279
I'm worried about you.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.778
I need you to stop
before you're out of a job.

27:04.820 --> 27:07.186
It's too late. Eliot
already suspended me.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.256
What?
But don't worry about that.

27:09.290 --> 27:10.257
Listen to me. Brendan Quinn.

27:10.290 --> 27:13.088
He was working with Rudy Vernon
at the gun range

27:13.130 --> 27:14.927
the day your gun was stolen.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.791
Rudy Vernon?

27:16.830 --> 27:18.923
He's dead. Murdered.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.234
I'm gonna find out
what Brendan Quinn knows.

27:21.270 --> 27:24.307
You go near the Quinns,
they'll arrest you.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.161
I'm not letting you go away
for something you didn't do.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.337
There is no me
Without you.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.678
We're a team.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.007
So, What are we gonna do?

27:33.050 --> 27:35.268
There's a solid wall of blue.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.714
Melissa's shield.

27:41.090 --> 27:45.288
There is one Quinn, a sister--
she's not a cop.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.958
Yeah, Melissa's sister Kathleen.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.126
Kathleen is

27:49.160 --> 27:50.388
who Brendan said he was with

27:50.430 --> 27:52.694
the night Oscar Payn
was murdered.

27:52.730 --> 27:54.994
Maybe she's our way
over the wall.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.764
The infamous Carrie Wells.

27:58.810 --> 28:01.199
Come on in. I really
want to talk to you.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.332
I'm surprised.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.268
I'm sure your father
warned you about me.

28:04.310 --> 28:07.006
You want to talk
about my brother, Brendan.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.210
Yeah.
Please.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.113
Brendan said he was with you

28:12.150 --> 28:13.788
the night
Oscar Payn was murdered.

28:13.820 --> 28:17.119
He was. We had dinner,
and he spent the night.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.787
He does that sometimes.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.127
The kids love him.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.798
He was here the entire night?

28:21.830 --> 28:23.821
Well, he was here at 10:00
when I went to bed.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.861
He was still here at 6:00
when I got up

28:25.900 --> 28:27.219
to make the kids breakfast.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.158
Leaves eight hours
he was alone.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.065
Look, Detective Wells...
Carrie.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.305
Carrie.

28:33.340 --> 28:36.969
I know you suspect my family
of some terrible things.

28:37.010 --> 28:39.240
But I guarantee
my father and my brother

28:39.280 --> 28:41.271
had nothing to do
with Oscar Payn.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.844
They wouldn't violate
their own ethics.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.383
We call it
the "Quinn Code."

28:47.960 --> 28:49.279
They arrested Al.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.880
They're processing him
in Rikers right now.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.509
VINCENT: You think my family
framed your partner.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.319
Who's this?

29:18.350 --> 29:20.284
I_t's_ Dom.
Dominic Moreno.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.981
Friend of the family?
Yeah.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.284
He was Melissa's boyfriend.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.423
They were
engaged, in fact,

29:26.460 --> 29:30.248
but Melissa broke up with him
shortly before... she died.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.790
Why?

29:31.830 --> 29:34.139
I think she was in love
With someone else.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.138
She never told me who.

29:36.170 --> 29:38.229
But I remember it was
really hard for her.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.261
How did he take the breakup?

29:40.310 --> 29:41.231
Not well.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.202
He used to be _
really close to our family,

29:43.240 --> 29:44.446
almost like another brother.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.345
But then after
Melissa died,

29:46.380 --> 29:49.019
we sort of just
drifted apart.

29:49.050 --> 29:51.382
You don't think Dom's
involved in this?

29:51.420 --> 29:52.944
Did she tell you
who she was in love with?

29:52.990 --> 29:54.252
She said it was complicated.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.382
Complicated how?

29:55.420 --> 29:58.583
I think she meant he was married
or maybe outranked her.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.098
"Outranked her"?

30:01.130 --> 30:04.167
Is it possible
she was in love with...

30:04.200 --> 30:05.326
Al Burns, my partner?

30:05.370 --> 30:08.294
Carrie, if Melissa did have
feelings for your partner,

30:08.340 --> 30:09.329
she would never have

30:09.370 --> 30:10.906
crossed that line.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.407
The "Quinn Code," right?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.237
Exactly.

30:14.280 --> 30:18.046
Except Dominic Moreno--
he's not a Quinn.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.510
Only you could
get me to Astoria.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.324
Technically, it's
Long Island City.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.329
It's still Queens, which is
technical enough for me.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.329
This... personnel folder

30:39.370 --> 30:41.235
for Dominic Moreno.

30:41.270 --> 30:43.295
You want to tell me What
his connection is to all this?

30:43.340 --> 30:45.900
Not yet.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.259
I need a little
more information.

30:47.310 --> 30:49.335
Rudy Vernon, a cop--
he worked out at the gun range.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.302
I need anything
that ties him

30:51.350 --> 30:52.601
to Dominic Moreno.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.073
Phone calls, check stubs,
any contact at all.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.314
I'll try.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.341
And if you ever want
to fill me in...

30:58.390 --> 31:00.187
Thank you, Eliot.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.448
Wells?

31:01.490 --> 31:03.185
I need you to be
sure on this one.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.619
Dead to rights.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.548
If you're wrong,
we all go down.

31:06.590 --> 31:08.558
CARRIE:
Dominic Moreno.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.329
VVho?

31:10.360 --> 31:12.362
He's NYPD and Melissa Quinn's

31:12.400 --> 31:13.469
ex-ﬁanc.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.161
Didn't even know
she had a boyfriend.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.428
She never mentioned him.

31:16.470 --> 31:17.459
Well, she would
never have told you.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.501
What do you mean?

31:18.540 --> 31:20.599
I think she was
in love with you.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.108
She was a detective
under my command.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.949
Al, I was a detective
under your command.

31:24.980 --> 31:25.947
That's different.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.504
She worked for me and that's it.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.438
What does this have to do
with anything?

31:29.480 --> 31:31.118
Motive.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.344
Dominic Moreno

31:32.390 --> 31:34.483
is a cop,
he's a sharpshooter,

31:34.520 --> 31:37.182
and his ex-_fianc
was in love With you.

31:39.660 --> 31:42.128
All right,
so I

31:42.160 --> 31:43.991
Yes, if we can place him
at the gun range,

31:44.030 --> 31:45.463
we may have enough.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.661
I've never seen
any of these guys.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.031
Are you sure?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.062
You know What?
Let's try an experiment.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.509
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna be easy.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.531
Just... close your eyes.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.071
I'm not gonna close my eyes.

31:59.110 --> 32:00.543
If Dominic Moreno was
there at the gun range,

32:00.580 --> 32:03.378
if he was shadowing you,
you probably saw him.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.047
Close your eyes.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.217
Let's start from where
you lost your gun.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.309
I want to take you back
to the firing range.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.055
You weren't there.
How's this gonna help?

32:11.090 --> 32:12.284
I've been there before.

32:12.330 --> 32:13.683
And I remember everything.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.721
So I can set the scene.
Close your eyes.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.625
Take a breath.
You park your car.

32:17.660 --> 32:19.025
Mm-hmm.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.560
You head towards
the range shack.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.589
Mm-hmm.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.629
It's about 1:00 pm.

32:22.670 --> 32:25.559
The weather report says

32:25.610 --> 32:27.305
there's gonna be
a breeze coming northwest

32:27.340 --> 32:30.309
off the river.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.444
Yeah, okay.
Okay?

32:32.480 --> 32:35.574
Now, which stall
did you shoot at?

32:41.620 --> 32:43.508
I don't know.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.187
Al, you can do this.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.994
Now, you were standing
behind the firing line.

32:48.030 --> 32:51.591
Which way did you turn when
you left the range shack?

32:51.630 --> 32:53.996
Right. Right.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.098
I went right.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.539
CARRIE:
Okay.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.099
AL:
Stall 16.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.574
CARRIE: That's great.
And when you were done,

33:03.610 --> 33:05.475
the range officer came over
and checked your weapon.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.239
AL:
Yeah. I remember that.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.510
CARRIE:
Who did you see

33:11.750 --> 33:13.513
AL:
There was a guy

33:13.550 --> 33:15.518
wearing a knee brace;
he was limping.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.118
CARRIE: All right.
That's Brendan Quinn.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.422
Look around, do you see

33:18.460 --> 33:19.757
anybody else there?
Just relax.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.655
Try to remember.

33:37.310 --> 33:38.504
This guy...

33:38.550 --> 33:40.506
This guy, he was there.

33:40.550 --> 33:41.744
That's Dominic Moreno.
You did it!

33:41.780 --> 33:43.475
With a little help.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.818
So, let's say Dominic
Moreno paid Rudy Vernon

33:45.850 --> 33:47.147
to switch the guns.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.408
But how do we prove it?
Vernon's dead.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.488
Not the Quinns again.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.589
Carrie, I'm serious.

33:54.630 --> 33:57.098
All right. I'|| shut it.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.469
My patrol officers
have a response time

34:07.510 --> 34:09.239
of five minutes,
so you better be quick.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.406
I'm looking for your son.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.203
Brendan?
He's at work.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.649
No, he's not
and he's not at home.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.774
Listen, I'm not here
to accuse your family...

34:16.820 --> 34:18.219
or to bring up
difficult memories.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.740
But there's something
I have to tell you.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.487
The night Melissa's squad
went after Oscar Payn,

34:24.530 --> 34:26.384
Al Burns tried to protect her.

34:26.430 --> 34:30.298
How? By sending her walking
into the barrel of an AK?

34:30.330 --> 34:32.321
No, he told her
to hold her position

34:32.370 --> 34:33.689
and she disobeyed his order.

34:33.730 --> 34:34.867
That's not true.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.563
By his own incident report,
he sent her to her death.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.773
He wrote that report because
he didn't want it on record

34:41.810 --> 34:43.630
that she died
disobeying an order.

34:43.680 --> 34:45.671
He knew What that would do

34:45.710 --> 34:48.110
to your family and he knew
what it would do to you.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.175
Please... leave.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.484
I can't, because
I'm telling you the truth

34:52.520 --> 34:55.557
and I need you to believe me.

34:55.590 --> 34:57.785
Look, just take a second

34:57.820 --> 35:00.357
and think about
the way it all went down.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.652
Oscar Payn
and his drug dealers

35:01.700 --> 35:04.669
had an
eight-year-old girl hostage.

35:04.700 --> 35:08.397
ESU and Hostage
were still five minutes out.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.589
The deadline
was seconds away.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.267
Melissa had
the only clear shot,

35:11.310 --> 35:13.904
but she had to expose herself
to get it.

35:13.940 --> 35:17.103
You know What your daughter
would have done.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.769
One time--

35:23.820 --> 35:27.187
she must have been
eight-years-old herself--

35:27.220 --> 35:30.280
the family next door
had this stupid cat,

35:30.320 --> 35:32.220
kept getting itself
stuck places.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.194
One Sunday night,

35:34.230 --> 35:36.721
we had everyone
over for dinner.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.422
Somebody notices Melissa's
been gone for a while.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.289
Family
of cops, you know,

35:43.340 --> 35:44.432
so we panic.

35:44.470 --> 35:46.461
Everyone's looking
everywhere.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.301
She was 40 feet up
in that neighbor's tree

35:51.350 --> 35:52.908
with that stupid cat
in her arms.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.248
Couldn't figure out
how to get down.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.317
Why are you here?

36:00.350 --> 36:05.458
I believe that Dominic Moreno
blamed Al for Melissa's death.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.355
I think he murdered Oscar Payn

36:07.390 --> 36:09.950
and he's framing
my partner.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.627
What's this have
to do with Brendan?

36:11.670 --> 36:14.798
Moreno was at the gun range
when Al last qualified.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.967
I think he took
Al's Sig Sauer

36:17.000 --> 36:19.503
and replaced it
with an identical model.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.236
Now, I need to know
what Brendan knows.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.413
This is Captain Quinn.
I'm looking for my son Brendan.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.748
Are you sure?

36:33.790 --> 36:36.918
All right. Thanks.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.655
That's not good.

36:38.690 --> 36:39.884
Dominic dropped by.

36:39.930 --> 36:41.625
They left together on foot.

36:41.660 --> 36:44.265
Is there anywhere
you can think of they might go?

36:44.300 --> 36:45.528
Aanhere of
significance to them?

36:45.570 --> 36:47.663
They went to high
school together.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.895
Hung out every summer.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.737
KATHLEEN: But I guarantee,
my father and my brother

36:51.770 --> 36:53.601
had nothing to do
with Oscar Payn.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.608
They were lifeguards together,
weren't they?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.904
Yeah, they were.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.646
How far is Breezy Point Beach
from the gun range?

36:59.680 --> 37:02.217
Half a mile.
I'll drive.

37:05.850 --> 37:08.956
Man, this place.

37:08.990 --> 37:11.481
You see these fancy-ass
bathrooms they got in there?

37:14.300 --> 37:17.952
Remember Melissa crushing us
swimming out to the jetty?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.867
She was the best
swimmer of all of us.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.936
She was the best
everything of all of us.

37:22.970 --> 37:25.404
I miss her every minute
of every day.

37:27.710 --> 37:30.008
Yeah. Me too.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.940
So, uh, What's going on?

37:33.980 --> 37:36.369
There's this cop
from Major Crimes

37:36.420 --> 37:38.285
that said something
that worried me.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.981
Like what?

37:40.020 --> 37:41.988
I didn't want
to believe her.

37:42.020 --> 37:45.956
I don't...
want to believe her, but...

37:45.990 --> 37:48.652
uh, Rudy Vernon
turning up murdered.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.362
I don't know, Dom.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.823
That's not on Al Burns.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.769
Here.

38:00.810 --> 38:02.971
Just in case
something goes Sideways.

38:03.980 --> 38:07.006
Thanks.

38:07.050 --> 38:08.938
Just tell me
you didn't do this.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.379
Didn't do What?

38:10.420 --> 38:11.978
Don't play stupid.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.614
I was there when you stole those
Playboys from that newsstand.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.957
I know that face.

38:15.990 --> 38:17.014
You're acting crazy, man.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.381
You just got to
tell me the truth.

38:19.430 --> 38:20.454
About What?!

38:20.490 --> 38:21.491
I can help you.

38:21.530 --> 38:22.554
We can sort this out.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.658
No. No.
Dom!

38:23.700 --> 38:25.759
You left me-- all of you.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.392
Right when I need you most.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.967
Yeah, after Melissa...

38:30.000 --> 38:30.989
you turned into ghosts.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.429
What was that about?
I had no one!

38:33.470 --> 38:34.334
You know that's not true.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.109
We all reached out,
we wanted to help...

38:36.140 --> 38:38.005
Oh, bull!

38:38.040 --> 38:39.576
'Cause if you really
wanted to help,

38:39.610 --> 38:42.841
you would want to take down
Burns as much as I did.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.849
He took her away from me
and then he got her killed.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.414
He took my life away.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.851
Backup needs a few minutes
to get in position.

38:50.890 --> 38:52.619
We don't have
a few minutes.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.098
We'll go down to
the station house,

38:56.130 --> 38:57.950
we'll talk this out.

38:59.430 --> 39:01.091
Yeah, I got a better idea.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.075
If you go away, no one knows
I was at the firing range,

39:09.110 --> 39:11.078
and Burns stays in
the joint for life.

39:12.950 --> 39:13.905
That cop knows.

39:13.950 --> 39:15.110
Nah. She can't prove it.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.118
Only you can.

39:17.150 --> 39:18.139
I'm sorry, brother,

39:18.180 --> 39:19.408
I-I really am, but...

39:19.450 --> 39:21.088
VINCENT:
Dominic!

39:24.490 --> 39:26.424
Captain Vincent.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.998
You want to take out a Quinn,
then start with me!

39:42.440 --> 39:44.442
Come on. Come on.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.754
Stay on the ground.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.985
Excuse me.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.048
That's from Al Burns.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.428
You're gonna have to cuff him
and read him his rights.

40:07.470 --> 40:08.437
I'm a civilian.

40:08.470 --> 40:09.835
You're a cop.

40:09.870 --> 40:11.428
And a damn good one.

40:11.470 --> 40:13.700
Let me have that.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.676
Just in case my old pal

40:17.710 --> 40:21.202
Melvin Stearns asks
how a suspended officer

40:21.250 --> 40:23.741
ended up with a weapon.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.645
You know,
I am starting to like

40:25.690 --> 40:28.147
what I see of this "Quinn Code."

40:41.700 --> 40:43.236
Want to hear
a funny story?
Sure.

40:43.270 --> 40:45.830
Melvin Stearns--
turns out,

40:45.870 --> 40:48.873
someone informed the mayor
of Melvin's penchant for

40:48.910 --> 40:51.128
golfing vacations
in the Poconos

40:51.180 --> 40:54.172
and his curious little habit
of charging his green fees

40:54.210 --> 40:55.746
to the Department's
recreation budget.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.543
Really?

40:57.580 --> 40:58.808
It's all good though.

40:58.850 --> 41:01.910
I mean, they were looking for
a Chief of Parking Enforcement

41:01.960 --> 41:03.609
out in Gowanus anyway.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.254
Well, it couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.951
Was he

41:07.990 --> 41:09.753
There's a cake, right?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.892
There's got to be a cake.
Al!

41:12.600 --> 41:13.919
MURRAY:
Hey! Hey, buddy.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.039
JAY: Boss, I got
something for you.

41:17.070 --> 41:19.538
Oh.

41:21.210 --> 41:22.768
What can I say?
I splurged.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.607
I'm just kidding.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.278
It's good
to have you back, Burns.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.083
Thank you.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.259
Took you long enough
to get me out of jail.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.281
Well, I had to make a
little stop along the way.

41:41.330 --> 41:42.649
Yeah?

41:42.700 --> 41:46.295
That trifecta you
couldn't remember?

41:46.330 --> 41:48.890
It paid off. Give me
20 minutes with this

41:48.940 --> 41:50.532
at the blackjack table
and I will triple it.

41:50.570 --> 41:53.209
Triple?
Quadruple.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.572
I think we already
beat the odds today.

41:55.610 --> 41:57.032
Yeah.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.604
How about I take you
out to dinner?

41:59.580 --> 42:00.547
Christoffe's?

42:00.580 --> 42:01.501
Ooh. Last time we were there,

42:01.550 --> 42:03.711
I had the Moroccan chicken.
It was raw...

42:03.750 --> 42:05.980
We haven't been there
in, like, two years.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.681
Two years, two months, one day.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.812
Trust me.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.749
Always do.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.149
I have a question for you.

How could you not know

42:18.160 --> 42:20.196
Melissa Quinn was
in love with you?

42:22.900 --> 42:26.609
Because at the time,
I was in love with someone else.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.929
Marjorie Binstock.
What?

42:29.980 --> 42:31.709
Little blonde,
worked down in evidence.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.775
Always smelled
like oranges.
Oh.

42:33.810 --> 42:35.175
Think it was her conditioner.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.710
You know What I think?

42:36.750 --> 42:38.718
I think we should
go to Christoffe's.

42:38.750 --> 42:42.208
You deserve raw Moroccan
chicken and food p0isoning.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.182
Take your money.
