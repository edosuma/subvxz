00:11.718 --> 00:14.086
- What?
- No. Nothing.

00:14.087 --> 00:16.149
<i>Flies like a dream.</i>

00:17.749 --> 00:21.291
Well, she did before you
crashed her into a goddamn street

00:21.293 --> 00:23.460
anybody with the sense
God gave a goddamn duck

00:23.462 --> 00:25.996
could tell was nowhere
near wide enough.

00:25.998 --> 00:29.333
- Ugh, ducks.
- Don't start your racist bullshit.

00:29.334 --> 00:31.167
- You know I'm right.
- And I'm in no mood.

00:31.169 --> 00:32.637
In some kind of mood.

00:32.637 --> 00:34.670
Yeah, you want to guess why?

00:34.672 --> 00:36.873
<i>- Sterling?
- Like in general, or...</i>

00:36.874 --> 00:38.008
- Bird.
- Sterling!

00:38.009 --> 00:41.011
What?!
Sorry. What can I do for you?

00:41.012 --> 00:44.347
<i>Well, you can start by watching
that tone, mister.</i>

00:44.349 --> 00:47.217
And then, you can tell me
why I'm looking at the package

00:47.219 --> 00:49.719
you were supposed to fly
to Tahiti today.

00:49.721 --> 00:51.854
<i>Oh, did I not do that?</i>

00:51.856 --> 00:56.726
Do I need to remind you just who
exactly owns that flying crate?

00:57.895 --> 01:02.231
So wherever you idiots are,
and whatever idiocy you're up to...

01:02.233 --> 01:03.634
<i>- I...
- I don't think idiots</i>

01:03.635 --> 01:05.801
<i>know how to find
a million dollar treasure.</i>

01:05.803 --> 01:07.137
A what?!

01:07.138 --> 01:08.638
<i>What'd she say, what treasure?</i>

01:08.639 --> 01:11.974
<i>What are you two up to?
Sterling?</i>

01:11.975 --> 01:13.742
<i>Because you're both
company employees</i>

01:13.744 --> 01:17.879
<i>using company resources on
company time, and so, legally,</i>

01:17.881 --> 01:21.283
<i>anything of value,
be it monetary or otherwise,</i>

01:21.285 --> 01:23.752
<i>that you may happen to make,
find, stumble upon,</i>

01:23.754 --> 01:25.154
<i>or otherwise obt...</i>

01:27.724 --> 01:30.158
I, uh, probably shouldn't
have said anything, huh?

01:30.160 --> 01:33.762
- Yeah, but was that necessary?
- No, Crackers, it wasn't.

01:33.764 --> 01:36.297
In fact, it was wildly unnecessary.

01:36.299 --> 01:39.600
Like radish roses,
or Pam running her fat mouth.

01:39.602 --> 01:41.770
- I like radish roses.
- Right?

01:41.771 --> 01:43.272
- Typical.
- Of what?

01:43.273 --> 01:45.740
Of assholes.
Now get out your shitty map

01:45.741 --> 01:47.376
and get us to that goddamn idol

01:47.377 --> 01:49.544
so I can lie to my mother
about finding it,

01:49.546 --> 01:53.113
and begin living a life of
luxury where she can't find me.

01:53.115 --> 01:56.016
Okay. God.
And it's not a shitty map.

01:56.018 --> 01:57.185
It'll take us right to the idol.

01:57.186 --> 01:59.874
Just set old Lucy down
in Dead Man's Cove.

01:59.909 --> 02:02.674
Seriously?
What, did somebody have dibs

02:02.675 --> 02:07.781
- on Foreshadowing Lagoon?
- Hmm. It doesn't say.

02:41.388 --> 02:44.435
<b>9x05 - Strange Doings in the Taboo Groves</b>

02:46.069 --> 02:47.935
<i>I just want to reiterate</i>

02:47.937 --> 02:50.705
<i>that I think it was a pretty
bad idea to shoot the radio.</i>

02:50.707 --> 02:53.007
<i>Jesus, talk about foreshadowing.</i>

02:53.009 --> 02:55.042
Yeah, or don't.
In fact, how about you two

02:55.044 --> 02:56.611
don't talk about any...

02:56.782 --> 03:00.851
- What the hell was that?
- Maybe howler monkeys?

03:03.022 --> 03:05.056
Hopefully howler monkeys?

03:05.058 --> 03:09.126
Yeah, except howler monkeys only live
in Central and South America.

03:09.128 --> 03:10.762
Not only.
Monkeys live everywhere.

03:10.763 --> 03:11.930
- No, they...
- Shut up.

03:11.931 --> 03:15.332
One time, I saw a monkey in a bar,
in Paris, France, Europe.

03:15.334 --> 03:17.400
- Wha...?
- Dressed as a teeny tiny waiter.

03:17.402 --> 03:21.038
Well, then I obviously stand corrected.

03:21.039 --> 03:24.041
<i>- Yeah. Like an idiot.
- I'm sorry?</i>

03:24.042 --> 03:26.910
- Hello. Breakfast?
- Oh, do tell.

03:26.912 --> 03:29.079
I will have a crispy
golden Belgian waffle,

03:29.081 --> 03:30.947
drizzled with melted
Belgian chocolate,

03:30.949 --> 03:33.783
with a side of Belgian endive.

03:33.785 --> 03:35.685
And I feel like I'd feel a lot better

03:35.687 --> 03:37.553
if you were maybe
writing this down.

03:37.555 --> 03:40.123
No need, that's just
The King Leopold.

03:40.125 --> 03:43.994
Really?
That's, like, a dish you have?

03:43.996 --> 03:49.131
Oh, sarcasm. Well, then
I'll just have champagne.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.301
- Fresh out.
- Can you check again?

03:51.302 --> 03:53.202
Or, I could have
the Germans rip up

03:53.204 --> 03:56.171
the walls and floors
helping you look?

03:56.173 --> 04:01.665
- What kind?
- Mm... most expensive.

04:01.980 --> 04:06.215
Speaking of which, has Sterling
mentioned anything to you

04:06.217 --> 04:10.019
about coming
into some money, or, say...

04:10.021 --> 04:11.853
treasure?

04:11.855 --> 04:14.556
Oh, you mean since the night he
defiled my young, supple body,

04:14.558 --> 04:17.858
destroyed my marriage, and
sentenced me to a life of shame?

04:17.861 --> 04:21.963
Or whenever.
And why the hell are you in here?!

04:21.964 --> 04:25.134
- Uh, breakfast?
- Not in here. You're 86'd.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.902
But I'm very hungry,

04:26.904 --> 04:30.171
<i>and for some verdammt reason,
Luigi is not open.</i>

04:30.173 --> 04:34.876
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

04:34.878 --> 04:38.712
I also overheard you mention
something about hidden treasure?

04:38.714 --> 04:41.049
- Nope.
- And also, I could not help

04:41.051 --> 04:43.884
but notice you have there
a map of the island?

04:43.886 --> 04:45.819
- Nope.
- And so, naturally, I wonder

04:45.821 --> 04:48.990
if you think there is some treasure
hidden somewhere on the island.

04:48.991 --> 04:51.725
Like in the book
by Robert Louis Stevenson?

04:51.727 --> 04:53.427
"Weir of Hermiston?"

04:53.429 --> 04:55.429
<i>Wha...?
Nein, Treasure Island.</i>

04:55.431 --> 04:57.131
I don't know
all his goddamn books!

04:57.132 --> 04:59.700
- Move!
- But what I know

04:59.702 --> 05:02.770
is that unless you want Manu
to scramble your eggs...

05:02.772 --> 05:05.907
Yeah, I would love some scrambled...
Oh, I see.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.841
You mean my testicles.

05:07.843 --> 05:11.511
<i>Schreckliche Stadt
zum Frühstück.</i>

05:11.513 --> 05:14.347
Well? Which way,
"insert obscure reference

05:14.349 --> 05:15.716
to a famous cartographer"?

05:15.717 --> 05:18.086
- Ooh, Hendrik Hondius?
- Sure. Pam?

05:18.087 --> 05:20.854
- I don't know who that is.
- No. Which way?

05:20.855 --> 05:23.690
Okay, so...
okay, so, the thing is...

05:23.692 --> 05:26.359
Give me that.
Oh, my God.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.596
- Is that... shit?
- What?

05:28.597 --> 05:31.799
- Ew!
- No, dumb-ass. It's barbecue sauce.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.666
- Wha...?
- Kansas City or Carolina?

05:33.668 --> 05:36.770
- What am I, an asshole?
- Already established, and so,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.338
what was already
the world's worst map

05:38.339 --> 05:40.773
you somehow made
even worse by...

05:40.775 --> 05:42.109
Wait, where'd you get barbecue?

05:42.110 --> 05:43.810
- What?
- I haven't had barbecue

05:43.811 --> 05:45.877
since we left Spain,
where the hell did you get it?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.547
- Oh. Uh...
- Pam.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.881
- Look, it's not...
- Oh, my God.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.117
- Did you...
- Oh, no.

05:50.118 --> 05:51.251
Eat a person?

05:51.252 --> 05:53.219
- What? No!
- Ew!

05:53.221 --> 05:55.888
- Then, where'd you get barbecue?
- I didn't.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.789
Then why'd you have
barbecue sauce?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.691
I don't... I mean,
I've been drinking it.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.860
- What?
- Oh, for the...

06:00.861 --> 06:03.062
As an aperitif.
Happy?

06:03.063 --> 06:06.799
- Happy you drink barbecue sauce?
- It's basically V8.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.634
It's brown sugar and ketchup.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.838
- Goddamn it, which way, Pam?
- That way.

06:11.839 --> 06:15.006
- You're sure?
- Positive.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.941
Well, you totally sold that.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.244
I'm gonna miss
that dopey confidence

06:18.245 --> 06:20.945
once we find this damn idol...

06:20.947 --> 06:22.181
- What the...?
- Archer?

06:22.182 --> 06:25.150
<i>Oh! Ow! Oh!
Oh! Ugh!</i>

06:25.152 --> 06:29.321
- Oh...
- Archer?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.723
- Be careful.
- Thanks, dummy.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.860
- Eh.
- Oh, shit. It's a big, steep-ass ravine.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.995
Okay, I'm gonna
have to rappel down.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.330
<i>Should I come with you?</i>

06:39.331 --> 06:43.501
- Yeah. Or your dumb ass could fly.
- Oh, right.

06:51.143 --> 06:54.445
- Come on, you got it, just hurry up.
- Why, is he hurt?

06:54.446 --> 06:55.880
- No, but...
- Shut up.

06:55.881 --> 06:59.749
- Archer? You okay?
- Uh, yeah, currently.

07:01.529 --> 07:04.155
What do you mean, "currently"?

07:04.156 --> 07:06.556
Holy shitsnacks!

07:06.558 --> 07:09.092
- Yeah.
- Quicksand!

07:09.094 --> 07:14.523
Yeah.
And that's still going on.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.679
Which... so great.

07:18.717 --> 07:21.717
You can not be serious.
Archer?

07:21.718 --> 07:22.985
Is out there looking for the idol?

07:22.986 --> 07:24.353
How does he even know
where to look?

07:24.354 --> 07:26.387
Well, I have no way
to know this, but, uh...

07:26.389 --> 07:29.891
But meanwhile, instead of
searching the jungle for the idol,

07:29.893 --> 07:31.759
your men are getting drunk
every night

07:31.761 --> 07:34.829
<i>and shtupping
the crazy coconut lady.</i>

07:34.831 --> 07:36.831
<i>They are really möndsuchtig.</i>

07:36.833 --> 07:39.151
- "Moonstruck"?
- Moonstruck.

07:39.152 --> 07:42.035
- Besotted.
- I know what it means.

07:42.037 --> 07:43.904
But I can't help wonder
if Japanese soldiers

07:43.906 --> 07:46.006
wouldn't be much more disciplined.

07:46.008 --> 07:49.010
All right. I get your point.
I will find it.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.111
<i>Now, how about a little frühstück,</i>

07:51.113 --> 07:54.882
- my little passion fruit?
- Not until you pay me for the idol.

07:54.884 --> 07:58.718
Oh, but that makes our
relationship sound so transactional.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.754
It is transactional.

08:00.756 --> 08:03.090
I know, but it hurts to hear it.

08:03.092 --> 08:08.148
No idol, no money, no fruit.

08:08.963 --> 08:13.466
<i>Deine Freizeit.
Ist kaputt!</i>

08:13.468 --> 08:15.968
<i>Erste Sache,
nicht mehr mit deiser</i>

08:15.970 --> 08:19.238
<i>verrückten Kokosnussfrau
shtuppen!</i>

08:19.240 --> 08:20.808
<i>Was willst Du?</i>

08:20.809 --> 08:23.276
Uh, we were wondering
if, perhaps, as a group,

08:23.278 --> 08:24.544
we could speak English?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.478
<i>- Yeah, English.
- Warum?</i>

08:26.480 --> 08:29.848
Well, as you call her,
this "crazy coconut lady,"

08:29.850 --> 08:32.985
does not speak German, so we
would like to practice English.

08:32.986 --> 08:34.822
<i>- Yeah.
- Why not?</i>

08:34.857 --> 08:35.755
Why, do you think this woman

08:35.756 --> 08:37.924
<i>would ever marry
one of you dummkopfen?</i>

08:39.059 --> 08:41.895
- I mean...
- Fine. English, then.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.462
We march today into the jungle,

08:43.464 --> 08:45.330
where we will search for
and find,

08:45.332 --> 08:49.635
something vital to the future
of our great fatherland.

08:49.637 --> 08:53.405
But the jungle is very
dangerous, full of lizards

08:53.407 --> 08:56.308
<i>and snakes and cannibals
and what else, Gott weiß?</i>

08:56.310 --> 08:59.245
- Can we shoot the lizards and snakes?
- Yes, of course.

08:59.246 --> 09:02.981
- Can we shoot the cannibals?
- You can shoot anything you want!

09:02.983 --> 09:04.950
Now are there
any other questions?

09:06.920 --> 09:08.954
That are not
about shooting things?

09:08.956 --> 09:10.989
Then, let's go.

09:10.991 --> 09:12.990
The American pilots may
have a head start on us.

09:12.992 --> 09:15.960
They also may be smarter
than they look.

09:15.962 --> 09:18.236
Because get the hell off me, bird!

09:18.271 --> 09:19.848
But I'm hugging you,
with my talons.

09:19.883 --> 09:21.165
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm here for you.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.167
Well, "be here" somewhere else.

09:23.169 --> 09:25.470
Yeesh. With friends like you.

09:25.472 --> 09:27.905
Case in point, what'd
you mean when you said

09:27.907 --> 09:29.974
you were gonna miss me
once we found the idol?

09:29.976 --> 09:31.509
I... can we talk about this later?

09:31.510 --> 09:33.844
No. Why'd you say you'd miss me?

09:33.846 --> 09:35.146
I... look, you're gonna miss me

09:35.147 --> 09:36.981
if I drown
in this goddamn quicksand.

09:36.983 --> 09:40.817
Yeah, try not to thrash around,
it makes you sink faster.

09:40.819 --> 09:43.054
- How would you know?
- Cowboy movies.

09:43.055 --> 09:44.788
Can you please
just get me out of here?

09:44.790 --> 09:46.223
And how's this
even supposed to work?

09:46.224 --> 09:47.825
Oh, my God, Elisha Otis,

09:47.826 --> 09:50.193
you throw the rope
over that branch up there.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.662
I catch the rope,
I hold onto the rope.

09:52.664 --> 09:55.432
You hold on to your end of the rope,
and then you pull me to safety.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.367
But wait, I mean,
I can't pull you out

09:57.369 --> 10:01.471
- if you weigh more than I do.
- Excuse me?

10:01.473 --> 10:02.939
I mean, that's like science-physics.

10:02.940 --> 10:06.376
- You think I weigh more than you.
- Uh, yeah.

10:06.378 --> 10:08.295
- You're a man.
- Crackers?

10:08.296 --> 10:09.913
- Nope.
- Bird?

10:09.914 --> 10:13.116
Wait, what? You think
I weigh more than him?

10:13.118 --> 10:15.519
I mean...
No, not in a...

10:15.520 --> 10:18.994
Come on, you're big-boned.
And easily six five.

10:19.029 --> 10:19.923
Now can you please use

10:19.924 --> 10:22.190
those big-ass bones to get
me out of this bullshit?

10:22.192 --> 10:24.159
Okay, smart guys, I'll bet you.

10:25.429 --> 10:29.398
- 50 bucks says Archer's heavier.
- Make it a hundred.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.834
- You're on.
- Well, but there's his actual weight,

10:31.836 --> 10:33.836
plus you also have to overcome
the suction power

10:33.838 --> 10:36.338
of the quicksand, and I don't
know if that's expressed

10:36.340 --> 10:39.007
in foot-pounds,
or newton metres, or...

10:39.009 --> 10:40.510
I don't care if it's in ergs.

10:40.511 --> 10:42.577
- It's not.
- She still weighs more than me.

10:42.579 --> 10:47.015
- Then, let's make it 200.
- Bring it.

10:47.017 --> 10:49.017
The real problem here, though,
isn't which one of you

10:49.019 --> 10:52.687
weighs more, it's your combined
weights in relation to the...

10:52.689 --> 10:54.689
- Whoa!
- Oh, no, no, no. Ow!

10:54.691 --> 10:56.691
Oh! Ooh! W-Whoa.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.863
Yeah, I was gonna say
the branch.

11:04.568 --> 11:07.068
I mean, first Pam mentions treasure

11:07.070 --> 11:10.337
and then that sneaky little
kraut gets all flustered,

11:10.339 --> 11:12.440
like he's heard of the treasure?

11:12.442 --> 11:14.882
What if there's actually
treasure on the island?

11:14.936 --> 11:16.611
Think it is a good story.

11:16.612 --> 11:19.146
I mean, it is no
"Weir of Hermiston," but...

11:19.148 --> 11:22.817
- Oh, shut up. What about him?
- He's not read it.

11:22.818 --> 11:25.151
No. Ask him about the treasure.

11:25.153 --> 11:27.320
Like if there's a native legend
or something.

11:27.322 --> 11:32.642
_

11:33.428 --> 11:37.831
- He says yes.
- Where? Ask him where.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.000
<i>Où, Doudou, où?</i>

11:40.002 --> 11:43.869
He says somewhere
in this area here,

11:43.871 --> 11:46.139
<i>close to La Crique
De I'Homme Mort.</i>

11:46.141 --> 11:48.374
It means Dead Man's Cove.

11:48.376 --> 11:52.583
"Dead Man's Cove"?
What, did somebody

11:52.618 --> 11:55.548
already have dibs
on Harbinger Harbor?

11:55.550 --> 11:59.538
- He say he don't know.
- Because why'd you say

11:59.539 --> 12:02.254
you'd miss me
once we found the goddamn idol?

12:02.256 --> 12:03.657
- Oh, my God.
- Well?

12:03.658 --> 12:05.825
I... wait. Crackers.

12:05.827 --> 12:07.660
If I can tie the rope
around this heavy branch,

12:07.662 --> 12:10.062
can you fly it up
into the notch of that tree

12:10.064 --> 12:11.498
and kind of wedge it in there?

12:11.499 --> 12:14.167
I don't know.
Can you bench-press a train?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.801
"I don't know.
Can you bench-press a train?"

12:15.802 --> 12:19.037
Hey, but what I could do is
use the radio in the plane to...

12:19.039 --> 12:22.174
wait for it...

12:22.176 --> 12:24.209
- You know...
- I could fly back to town and get help.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.678
- I'm sure your mother would...
- No.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.447
All Mother cares about
is getting her Manu-hooks

12:28.449 --> 12:32.050
into whatever money the idol's
worth thanks to Pam, so no.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.053
- Nobody's going anywhere.
- Certainly not you two.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.089
Will you shut up and let me think?

12:38.491 --> 12:42.627
- Why'd you say you'd miss me if you...
- Goddamn it! Because!

12:42.629 --> 12:46.264
Pam! I'm currently up
to my ears in quicksand!

12:46.266 --> 12:48.266
And before that,
I flew here in a plane

12:48.268 --> 12:50.568
made out of literal garbage,
and before that,

12:50.570 --> 12:53.571
my eyeball got shot out
in Spain, and before that,

12:53.573 --> 12:56.040
I went bust on those
goddamn chinchilladas.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.543
And the common denominator
in every bad thing

12:58.545 --> 13:02.647
that's ever happened to me
is you! And you know why?!

13:02.649 --> 13:06.050
Because the only two kinds of
luck you have are bad and none

13:06.052 --> 13:09.153
because you are a jinx!

13:09.155 --> 13:12.455
And that idol is my ticket
out of Loserville,

13:12.457 --> 13:15.525
population you!

13:21.700 --> 13:26.102
- Goddamn, dude.
- Shut up, bird! And as for you...

13:26.104 --> 13:31.308
Hey. Hey, come on.
Knock it off. I-I-I'm sorry.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.210
I didn't mean that.
I-I just meant...

13:33.212 --> 13:34.378
Ow! What the...?

13:38.950 --> 13:41.383
So great.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.661
Ow.

13:47.662 --> 13:49.429
What the hell
are you doing over there?

13:49.431 --> 13:52.798
- Waiting for your pitch?
- I'm doing the best I can.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.567
Which I'm sure
isn't good enough for you

13:54.569 --> 13:58.171
because apparently, it never is,
but don't worry.

13:58.173 --> 14:00.373
If we get out of here alive...

14:00.375 --> 14:02.841
you and me are quitsies.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.177
Well, that suits me just fine.

14:05.179 --> 14:08.280
- Ow!
- Well, it's been not so nice knowing you.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.616
Guys, come on, you're talking crazy.

14:10.618 --> 14:12.318
Well, why should I
stick around somebody

14:12.319 --> 14:15.221
- who doesn't appreciate me?
- No, about getting out of here alive.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.089
Uh, I've been in tougher
scrapes than... ow!

14:17.091 --> 14:19.191
He's right. We can't do this forever.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.363
<i>That is very strange.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:27.432
It sounds like howler monkeys,

14:27.434 --> 14:30.168
but they are not indigenous
to the Pacific.

14:30.170 --> 14:34.371
Yes, damn it,
you can shoot the monkeys!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.540
Then what?
What was your question?

14:36.542 --> 14:41.145
Sorry. I was just going to ask
if we can shoot the monkeys.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.147
- What?!
- He just said that.

14:43.149 --> 14:47.118
Ah, I know, but I was going
to ask it before he said that

14:47.120 --> 14:50.888
and then he asked me what my
question was and...

14:52.558 --> 14:55.226
Any other questions?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.595
Well, then what would
you suggest?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.823
- That I fly back to town for help.
- No!

14:58.858 --> 15:00.197
- What?
- What do you mean, "no"?

15:00.199 --> 15:02.099
You go back for help,
Mother's gonna find out,

15:02.101 --> 15:05.202
get her nosy beak all up in it
and the next thing you know,

15:05.204 --> 15:07.604
she tricks us out of our
million dollar treasure.

15:07.613 --> 15:10.240
- What?
- Wait. So, you'd rather just die?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.542
Than to see her spending
my fortune on boy toys

15:12.544 --> 15:14.511
and artisanal gin? Ow!

15:14.513 --> 15:15.780
- Oh, my God.
- Well?

15:15.781 --> 15:16.881
- I'm going for help.
- No!

15:16.882 --> 15:18.516
- Yes!
- No!

15:18.517 --> 15:21.184
- Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
- Goddamn it, Crackers.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.787
And you get the bird, by the way.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.321
- Who says I want him?
- I can still hear you.

15:25.323 --> 15:27.642
<i>- Shut up, bird!
- Eh.</i>

15:27.677 --> 15:30.527
<i>- Excuse me?
- I said I'm going with you</i>

15:30.529 --> 15:32.529
to look for hidden treasure
or whatever.

15:32.531 --> 15:36.032
- Have you lost your mind?
- I think maybe I have,

15:36.067 --> 15:38.134
yeah, because if you leave me here,

15:38.136 --> 15:40.770
I am gonna burn down
your goddamn hotel!

15:40.772 --> 15:45.274
- You can't! Arrest her.
- Oh, no. Never again.

15:45.276 --> 15:47.502
I say bring her along.
With any luck,

15:47.537 --> 15:50.212
she will be torn apart
and eaten by wild animals.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.014
Mm-mmm!

15:53.885 --> 15:57.586
- Aw, shit.
- Oh, for... way to go, idiot.

15:57.588 --> 15:59.588
How is that my fault? Ow.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.856
How is everything your fault? Ow!

16:01.858 --> 16:03.792
- Exactly.
- Wait, what?

16:03.794 --> 16:05.527
You're the one who's always
shooting off his...

16:05.529 --> 16:07.901
- Hey, wait. Where's your gun?
- Why?

16:07.936 --> 16:10.365
You need something that's
full of goddamn quicksand?

16:10.367 --> 16:12.034
You can at least show it to them.

16:12.035 --> 16:13.703
What good would that possibly do?

16:13.704 --> 16:15.436
I don't know.
It might scare them off.

16:15.438 --> 16:17.605
They don't know what a gun is.
Ow!

16:17.607 --> 16:19.307
You don't know that.

16:19.309 --> 16:21.475
For all you know, they broke
out of some top secret lab.

16:21.477 --> 16:23.411
They might be super intelligent.

16:23.413 --> 16:26.447
- Do they look super intelligent?
- Oh.

16:26.449 --> 16:29.050
Who among us... ow!

16:29.052 --> 16:31.051
Come on.
Show them the heater.

16:31.053 --> 16:33.521
But only because this is the last time

16:33.523 --> 16:37.391
I do one of your stupid ideas.
There. Happy?

16:39.462 --> 16:42.297
What the...?
Holy shit.

16:42.298 --> 16:43.832
- They're running away.
- See?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.566
It wasn't because of the gun.

16:45.568 --> 16:47.634
Yeah. I mean, maybe
they were just as sick

16:47.636 --> 16:49.803
of your bullshit as I am.

16:49.805 --> 16:51.605
They sound very excited, no?

16:51.607 --> 16:55.909
Must be with the crazy coconut lady.

16:55.911 --> 16:59.980
<i>Doudou!
Idiot, regards la route!</i>

16:59.982 --> 17:03.350
Oh, my God, and if you see
any oysters, we have to stop.

17:03.352 --> 17:05.385
I am starving.

17:05.387 --> 17:07.854
Wh... where the hell
would we see oysters?!

17:08.856 --> 17:10.923
Wherever.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.858
- Oh, whatever.
- Then tell me.

17:12.861 --> 17:14.728
Tell me one time us being partners

17:14.730 --> 17:18.565
got us out of a bad situation
instead of deeper in it.

17:18.567 --> 17:22.102
Oh, great.
Maybe you could float us out.

17:22.103 --> 17:25.188
I'm sorry. It just hurts
to hear your best friend

17:25.189 --> 17:30.109
in the whole world say it's
just been a big fat waste of time

17:30.111 --> 17:34.546
and he'd be better off
if he never even met you,

17:34.548 --> 17:40.051
even after you gave him
the best years of your life

17:40.053 --> 17:45.824
and you got nothing...
nothing to show for it

17:45.826 --> 17:50.529
except for half
an old magical bird!

17:50.531 --> 17:53.965
- Magical?
- Well, how else can you explain it?

17:53.967 --> 17:57.870
- That's not normal bird behavior.
- He's a parrot.

17:57.871 --> 18:00.555
- Still, though.
- Well, but, come on,

18:00.556 --> 18:01.539
the best years of your life?

18:01.541 --> 18:03.675
I mean, it's not like
we were a couple.

18:03.677 --> 18:06.744
No. I was never a couple
with anybody

18:06.746 --> 18:09.480
because I put everything into us

18:09.482 --> 18:14.018
and I have nothing, Archer!
Nothing!

18:14.020 --> 18:16.421
Well, Jesus Christ, what
am I supposed to do, Pam?

18:16.423 --> 18:19.424
- Ask you to marry me?
- Wait, what?

18:19.426 --> 18:20.592
What?

18:20.593 --> 18:21.960
- Are you...?
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:21.961 --> 18:24.895
- No, I...
- Oh-ho! I get it!

18:24.897 --> 18:29.599
You'd have to be some kind
of giant flapping asshole

18:29.601 --> 18:32.903
to ask that big dumb
Pam Poovey to marry you!

18:32.905 --> 18:35.505
No, come on.
You're a great... gal.

18:35.507 --> 18:37.908
You're smart.
You're funny.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.877
Any guy would be lucky to have you.

18:39.879 --> 18:43.880
- You didn't say pretty.
- In your own way you are,

18:43.882 --> 18:46.416
if you'd ever put on
some makeup or a dress.

18:46.418 --> 18:47.918
And I mean, I assume you've got

18:47.919 --> 18:49.953
a pretty colossal set of tits
under there.

18:49.955 --> 18:52.989
They are.
They are goddamn colossal.

18:52.991 --> 18:56.093
And we are best friends.
You're actually the only person

18:56.094 --> 18:57.193
I don't hate to be around.

18:57.195 --> 19:00.629
I guess we do kind of make
a pretty great team.

19:00.631 --> 19:05.902
Wait. What are you...
what are you saying?

19:05.904 --> 19:08.704
I-I mean... I-I don't know.

19:08.706 --> 19:12.108
If-if I did ask you
to marry me someday,

19:12.110 --> 19:15.169
wh-wh-what would you say?

19:18.716 --> 19:23.253
Okay.

19:23.855 --> 19:25.921
Oh, my God.

19:25.923 --> 19:28.424
- You goddamn idiot.
- Okay.

19:28.426 --> 19:30.593
I can't believe
I got you to say that.

19:30.595 --> 19:34.729
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.

19:34.731 --> 19:38.066
- I mean, that idea sucks.
- Okay!

19:38.068 --> 19:42.871
That idea would suck a dick
just to cut in line

19:42.873 --> 19:46.441
- to suck a bigger dick.
- Okay, Pam.

19:46.443 --> 19:48.443
Oh, man.

19:48.445 --> 19:51.614
Thank you.
I needed that.

19:51.615 --> 19:54.550
Yeah, well, you know what I need?

19:54.551 --> 19:56.584
Oh, my God, it's up to my mouth.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.687
W-Wait. Why isn't it
up to your mouth?

19:59.689 --> 20:00.989
- What?
- The quicksand.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.892
- Why aren't you sinking?
- I can touch.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.960
- What?!
- My feet are touching the bottom.

20:05.962 --> 20:09.363
Then why didn't you
just walk out?!

20:09.365 --> 20:12.133
Well, I was going to,
then you started blubbering

20:12.135 --> 20:14.435
about how you wanted
to get married and shit and...

20:14.437 --> 20:16.537
Get your big ass out
of this goddamn quicksand

20:16.539 --> 20:19.764
- and then get my ass out!
- Okay, geez.

20:19.799 --> 20:21.308
- Lighten up already.
- Hurry up!

20:21.310 --> 20:23.709
You can't go through life
pissed off all the damn time.

20:23.711 --> 20:26.736
It'll give you ball cancer.
I had an uncle once,

20:26.771 --> 20:29.462
Norm, always pissed off and...
Whoops!

20:30.852 --> 20:35.087
- And?
- Um...

20:37.391 --> 20:39.525
What happened to Norm?

20:39.527 --> 20:43.869
Let me guess.
Did you annoy him to death?
