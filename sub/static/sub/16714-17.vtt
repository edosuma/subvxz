08:48.261 --> 08:50.228
that each of the victims
was carrying, we believe so.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.763
Could speak to this unsub's motive.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.798
He feels justified in
pulling the trigger.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.233

11:37.597 --> 11:39.430
Fighters, drunks,

11:39.432 --> 11:41.399
grade-A jackasses.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.801
Mind you, that's my personal opinion,

11:43.803 --> 11:44.969
- Not a medical one.
- [Cell phone rings]

11:44.971 --> 11:46.070
But it could help explain

11:46.072 --> 11:47.605
why he's choosing these victims.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.240
Excuse me.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.275
Hey, Fiona.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.843
Hey, I just got your message.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.211
Spencer didn't tell
me he'd been injured.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.480
And my fear is that if
he's been beaten up once,

11:55.482 --> 11:56.781
it's going to happen again.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.716
Is there anything you
can do to get him moved?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.852
I already filed the
protective custody transfer,

12:00.854 --> 12:03.388
but... look, the wheels
of justice spin slow,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.856
especially once you're in the system.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.392
Agent Alvez is on his way
over to the prison now.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.427
Is there any way you could
follow up with a wellness check?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.863
I'll clear my schedule.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.498
Thanks. I appreciate it.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.734
Hey, has Reid ever mentioned
an inmate named Shaw?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.736
No. Who's that?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.571
So you're stuck, huh?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.140
I told you, there's no upside

12:22.142 --> 12:23.675
to being a hero in here.

12:23.677 --> 12:24.842
Well, here's the thing.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.611
Luis said they would
come up with demands,

12:26.613 --> 12:29.180
and that tells me that
they're willing to negotiate.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.649
There's got to be something I can offer.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.085
I might be able to do
some shuttle diplomacy.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.553
What are you offering?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.422
Well, I'll do anything
that isn't illegal.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.591
You ever hear the term
“heteroflexible”?

12:40.593 --> 12:44.595
No. I meant I would, like,
help them with their taxes

12:44.597 --> 12:45.797
or, like, teach them how to read.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.998
You got a visitor.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.052
I know you?

13:08.054 --> 13:10.922
No, but I know you.

13:10.924 --> 13:14.759
I'm SSA Luke Alvez with the BAU.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.195
We've got a lot to talk about.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.833
The state police were
finally able to find

13:21.835 --> 13:23.801
trace DNA in the woods. They compared it

13:23.803 --> 13:25.803
to the home invasion kills.
It's a match.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.306
So we have one guy. That's a lot of work

13:28.308 --> 13:29.874
to be killing both day and night.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.976
It's clear he has the
motivation to kill the poachers,

13:31.978 --> 13:33.678
but what about the stabbings?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.413
And why start now?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.782
He could be having some kind
of temporary psychotic break.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.584
I mean, he's organized and
controlled during the day

13:39.586 --> 13:40.885
and then chaotic at night.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.687
JJ: Plus, he's mission-oriented

13:42.689 --> 13:44.155
when he kills the hunters,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.057
so you would think he would
feel satisfied afterwards,

13:46.059 --> 13:48.393
but no, he becomes destabilized.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.895
What if it's the killing
that's destabilizing him

13:50.897 --> 13:52.830
and locking something
worse inside of him?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.299
Dr. Jekyll turns into Mr. Hyde

13:55.301 --> 13:57.535
when the sun goes down.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.570
Let me guess.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.272
You're here checking out your boy Reid,

14:01.274 --> 14:03.341
shaking me down to make sure he's ok.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.643
No, I'm here for you, Calvin.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.546
Oh, we're using first names now.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.448
Don't think you know me that well.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.517
I know you very well.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.253
Yeah. You're revered
by some at the Bureau,

14:15.255 --> 14:18.056
and abhorrent to others.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.559
That's a big word for a
mouth-breather like you.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.828
'Cause, let's face it,

14:23.830 --> 14:27.598
compared to Dr. Reid and the
reputation of the rest of your team,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.501
you're slow, aren't you?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.303
I studied you.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.172
When I was with the fugitive taskforce,

14:34.174 --> 14:36.207
you were exhibit A in the class

14:36.209 --> 14:38.443
on indicators of guilt,

14:38.445 --> 14:41.579
something you examine
after a suspect flees.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.781
I didn't flee. I turned myself in.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.716
Because your C.I. for the Russian mob

14:45.718 --> 14:49.320
was going to expose some other
deep cover agents on the case.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.222
So you killed her,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.825
and then later you turned yourself in

14:53.827 --> 14:58.830
a whole year after you had killed her.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.298
Huh. I mean, it's...

15:00.300 --> 15:02.934
You had gotten away with it.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.870
What made you grow a heart?

15:05.872 --> 15:09.407
I got a theory. You want to hear it?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.309
No.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.944
You got somewhere to be?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.513
[Laughs] I just don't
have to listen to this.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.115
That's your right.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.485
You know, maybe I'll
share it with your son.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.422
Yeah. Your son.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.890
Your wife gave birth

15:25.892 --> 15:29.093
6 months after you killed Elena.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.163
Yeah.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.664
I don't know. I'm just wondering

15:33.666 --> 15:35.867
if that had something to do with it.

15:35.869 --> 15:39.437
Only that I wanted to raise
him with a clean conscience.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.773
Clean conscience.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.142
What?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.744
Yeah. Well, go with me here, ok?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.980
Elena, your C.I.,

15:48.982 --> 15:51.582
she was putting our
guys in danger, right?

15:51.584 --> 15:56.120
I could have killed her,
too, with a clean conscience.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.757
But that's... that's when my slow mind

15:59.759 --> 16:01.626
helped me out.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.896
Because I realized I didn't
have a complete theory.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.665
So I had to do a little digging,

16:07.667 --> 16:10.535
and I dug into her autopsy.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.104
They found a large quantity of HCG.

16:13.106 --> 16:17.889
That's a hormone that women
produce when they're pregnant.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.210
She wasn't pregnant.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.512
Well, we'll never really know,

16:21.514 --> 16:26.918
because one of the rounds
during the... struggle,

16:26.920 --> 16:29.420
it went right through the uterus.

16:31.558 --> 16:36.194
Our guys weren't in danger.
That was never it.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.596
You got her pregnant.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.665
And you weren't gonna
let her ruin your marriage

16:40.667 --> 16:45.503
or your career, so you did
what you felt you had to do.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.505
Then your wife gave birth.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.840
And you looked into your
newborn child's eyes,

16:49.842 --> 16:54.668
and... That's when your mind
started playing tricks on you.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.114
And you couldn't hack the guilt

16:57.116 --> 17:01.859
you were carrying, so
you turned yourself in.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.321
How am I doing?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.125
That's quite a theory.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.727
[Exhales]

17:09.729 --> 17:12.262
Let's talk about reality.

17:12.265 --> 17:17.594
Reid will not get hurt
in here again, ever.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.973
If he does, I'll make you suffer.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.178
I'm already in prison, dude.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.847
There ain't nothin' else
you can take from me.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.116
That's not true.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.661
You're very comfortable in here.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.304
I can take away a lot.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.726
I could take away your son.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.166
Guard!

17:50.270 --> 17:51.769
[Beep]

17:51.771 --> 17:53.404
[Door opens and closes]

17:53.406 --> 17:54.538
Uhh!

17:54.540 --> 17:58.342
[Suspenseful music playing]

17:58.344 --> 17:59.810
Uhh!

17:59.812 --> 18:01.345
Please tell me you
locked the front door.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.606
Come on. It's not even that bad.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.384
You know I hate horror movies.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.719
Look, how about we
watch it for 10 minutes

18:08.721 --> 18:09.820
and if you still don't like it,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.478
we'll watch something else.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.157
Ok.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.661
[Grunting, screaming on TV]

18:16.663 --> 18:18.129
[Knock on door]

18:18.131 --> 18:19.897
Think the pizza's here already?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.399
Good. I'll grab my purse.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.468
And don't hit pause.
This counts towards the 10 minutes.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.940
Hey, babe, I can't find my card.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.976
Do you have cash?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.577
Uhh! Ow!

18:33.579 --> 18:36.514
[Screaming]

18:40.086 --> 18:41.619
[Crash]

18:50.999 --> 18:52.666
Back door was open again.

18:52.668 --> 18:54.301
Maybe he tried to sneak out.

18:54.303 --> 18:56.336
Well, the victims'
names are Jon Kreutzmann

18:56.338 --> 18:57.804
and Lyn Anastasio.

18:57.806 --> 18:59.873
This is the first time
he's attacked a couple.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.976
Yeah, one stab to each
victim straight to the heart.

19:02.978 --> 19:06.346
Well, bloody footprints
from broken glass,

19:06.348 --> 19:10.083
but neither victim was barefoot.

19:10.085 --> 19:12.686
That means the unsub must have been.

19:12.688 --> 19:15.722
What kind of killer
doesn't wear socks or shoes?

19:15.724 --> 19:18.492
One who's going through a
temporary psychotic break.

19:18.494 --> 19:21.228
Lewis: He went after the girlfriend,

19:21.230 --> 19:22.896
he tore his foot up on the glass

19:22.898 --> 19:24.464
and he didn't even slow down.

19:24.466 --> 19:25.899
And even if he was psychotic,

19:25.901 --> 19:28.568
you would expect him to
react... limp, something.

19:28.570 --> 19:30.103
JJ: Ok, if it's not psychosis,

19:30.105 --> 19:32.839
what else would explain
it? Our theory's off.

19:32.841 --> 19:35.208
So we've got an unsub
who kills during the night

19:35.210 --> 19:36.877
and during the day.

19:36.879 --> 19:38.912
He hasn't taken a break
since we've landed.

19:38.914 --> 19:41.848
Then what condition does fit this?

19:41.850 --> 19:43.817
One that mimics psychosis but isn't,

19:43.819 --> 19:45.452
that allows him to ignore pain,

19:45.454 --> 19:48.788
that offers a temporary
break from reality at night

19:48.790 --> 19:52.626
and return to control during the day.

19:52.628 --> 19:54.494
An altered state.

19:54.496 --> 19:57.783
We need to deliver the profile.

19:58.534 --> 20:01.568
A sleepwalking serial killer?
Is that even possible?

20:01.570 --> 20:03.603
Actually, yes.
In addition to sleep eating

20:03.605 --> 20:05.438
and sleep sex, there are over 70

20:05.440 --> 20:07.374
documented cases of sleep murder.

20:07.376 --> 20:10.043
Based on the unsub's injuries
at last night's crime scene,

20:10.045 --> 20:11.735
he would be in immense pain.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.580
But he didn't stop.

20:13.582 --> 20:15.715
So he would only be
able to ignore that pain

20:15.717 --> 20:19.185
if he suffered from such conditions
as neuropathy or sleepwalking.

20:19.187 --> 20:20.720
Rossi: And he still has great aim,

20:20.722 --> 20:22.856
so we can rule out
neuropathy of the limbs.

20:22.858 --> 20:26.092
And that leaves
somnambulism, sleepwalking.

20:26.094 --> 20:29.262
But additional contributing
factors like depression,

20:29.264 --> 20:32.032
addiction, or OCD could keep his brain

20:32.034 --> 20:33.533
from reaching full REM sleep.

20:33.535 --> 20:36.002
He will wake up more
tired than he went to bed.

20:36.004 --> 20:38.705
Lewis: Psychologically, that
explains why he's killing at night.

20:38.707 --> 20:40.407
He's looking for some kind of a release

20:40.409 --> 20:42.576
when he kills while he's
awake that he's not getting.

20:42.578 --> 20:44.878
And his subconscious
won't let him off the hook.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.546
Rossi: That's why these
home invasion murders

20:46.548 --> 20:48.481
have been so messy and chaotic.

20:48.483 --> 20:51.017
All of the control he
uses to tamp down his rage

20:51.019 --> 20:53.887
when he's awake turns
off once he falls asleep.

20:53.889 --> 20:55.221
So how do we find him?

20:55.223 --> 20:56.790
We start by compiling a list of people

20:56.792 --> 20:59.192
with hunting licenses, and
we will cross-check those

20:59.194 --> 21:01.561
with sleep disorders
or common co-occurring

21:01.563 --> 21:05.498
psychological conditions like
anxiety, OCD, and depression.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.101
Have your troopers patrol
for wandering suspects

21:08.103 --> 21:09.669
who looked dazed and may be limping.

21:09.671 --> 21:12.439
This condition, mixed
with his psychopathology

21:12.441 --> 21:15.875
tells us he will almost
certainly strike again tonight.

21:15.877 --> 21:16.897
Thank you all.

21:25.354 --> 21:30.557
[Laughing]

21:37.532 --> 21:39.299
[Indistinct order]

21:39.301 --> 21:41.009
They told me what they want.

21:42.270 --> 21:45.605
Frazier's got his personal
supply coming through here

21:45.607 --> 21:47.774
and wants me to ensure
its safe delivery.

21:47.776 --> 21:49.309
How?

21:49.311 --> 21:50.777
Didn't say.

21:50.779 --> 21:53.580
I... I do this, then what
are they gonna make me do?

21:53.582 --> 21:55.281
Then don't. Tell them no.

21:55.283 --> 22:01.254
Screw that. Man, we gotta get into
protective custody or something.

22:03.725 --> 22:06.626
Hey. You can't take a break yet.

22:06.628 --> 22:08.395
Oh. Thank you.

22:08.397 --> 22:10.130
How you doing?

22:10.132 --> 22:11.331
I just got off the phone with Luke.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.433
He's on his way up from D.C. now.

22:13.435 --> 22:16.169
Good to hear.

22:16.538 --> 22:19.305
But how are you doing?

22:20.542 --> 22:22.442
Luke and Fiona are working

22:22.444 --> 22:24.778
to ensure Reid's safety in prison

22:24.780 --> 22:26.914
so he can make it to trial.

22:27.598 --> 22:28.851
But...

22:30.901 --> 22:33.972
Stephen, what if he's found guilty?

22:34.638 --> 22:38.106
You remember that case we
worked together in Auvergne?

22:38.108 --> 22:40.776
Yeah. Yeah, that was a tough case.

22:40.778 --> 22:42.744
Well, I thought when we
took that one to trial,

22:42.746 --> 22:45.347
we were going to lose, but you told me

22:45.349 --> 22:47.049
to let the system work,

22:47.051 --> 22:49.251
and you were right.

22:49.253 --> 22:51.053
So that's what we
have to do now...

22:51.055 --> 22:53.088
Let the system work.

22:54.391 --> 22:56.859
Wait a minute. That guy was guilty.

22:56.861 --> 22:59.161
Right now we don't
want the system to work.

22:59.163 --> 23:01.463
I was hoping you wouldn't remember that.

23:01.465 --> 23:04.299
That's why I don't give pep talks.

Alvez: Can you describe him?

24:12.091 --> 24:15.358
Young guy, maybe in his 20s.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.260
He was wearing pajamas.

24:17.599 --> 24:18.965
How did he act?

24:18.967 --> 24:21.368
Uh, I don't know.

24:21.370 --> 24:23.437
Catatonic, maybe?

24:23.439 --> 24:25.839
Yeah, you could say that.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.474
You know? But after I shot at the guy,

24:27.476 --> 24:28.787
he snapped out of it.

24:28.787 --> 24:31.645
He looked confused at first
and then took off running.

24:32.303 --> 24:35.170
Then you say he ran through
the house and out the back door?

24:35.172 --> 24:38.190
Yeah. Guess he knew not to
bring a knife to a gunfight.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.400
Thank you for your time.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.172
He dropped it on the way out.

24:43.174 --> 24:44.674
Found it in the backyard.

24:44.676 --> 24:46.509
How did he know the back
door was there to begin with?

24:46.511 --> 24:47.877
He must have been here before.

24:47.879 --> 24:50.513
You think he sleepwalked here before?

24:50.515 --> 24:53.283
No. No, he came here awake.

24:53.285 --> 24:56.486
I know what we've been
missing this whole time.

24:58.189 --> 24:59.889
You ever wonder how sleepwalkers

24:59.891 --> 25:01.925
are able to avoid crashing into walls

25:01.927 --> 25:03.593
or walking into ditches?

25:03.595 --> 25:06.229
It's because they have
this... location recognition.

25:06.231 --> 25:07.830
It's a form of spatial awareness.

25:07.832 --> 25:08.965
It's actually more than that.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.567
It allows them to retrace their steps

25:10.569 --> 25:12.035
back to the places they've been.

25:12.037 --> 25:13.903
So if they've been
somewhere when they're awake,

25:13.905 --> 25:16.639
their subconscious will
remember it while they're asleep.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.474
Yeah, sleepwalkers have
even been known to drive

25:18.476 --> 25:20.143
back to locations they're familiar with.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.145
The unsub's been so careful

25:22.147 --> 25:23.613
to hide his kills in the woods,

25:23.615 --> 25:25.748
but when he woke
up at Paul's house...

25:25.750 --> 25:29.052
The unsub realized he'd been
killing people he deemed innocent.

25:29.054 --> 25:32.021
So he feels justified about
his kills in the woods,

25:32.023 --> 25:33.623
but horrified by the others.

he can to stay awake.

he'll start hunting again.

32:37.215 --> 32:39.615
Ok, my fearless, furry friends,

32:39.617 --> 32:42.451
we all know that these houses

32:42.453 --> 32:44.987
are small, single-bedroom bungalows

in up-and-coming parts of town.

And they're really cute
houses, if I do say so myself.

32:48.860 --> 32:50.726
After some further spelunking,

32:50.728 --> 32:53.029
it turns out that up
until about 10 years ago,

32:53.031 --> 32:55.498
all of the residences
were either drug dens

32:55.500 --> 32:57.466
or houses of prostitution.

32:57.468 --> 32:59.769
Anyone have multiple
arrests at those locations?

32:59.771 --> 33:03.372

possession, solicitation

poachers in the area.

vegetables with gas.

a heart attack 6 weeks ago.

33:20.024 --> 33:21.457

33:23.227 --> 33:25.394
looked like he was in his 20s.

33:25.396 --> 33:26.762

things, 'cause all these men

33:26.764 --> 33:28.164

you say Samuel Gordon died?

6 weeks ago.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.369
That fits our unsub's timeline.

33:33.371 --> 33:34.703
Tell us more about him.

33:34.705 --> 33:37.073
Ok, let me see.
63-year-old Samuel Gordon,

33:37.075 --> 33:38.707
poacher extraordinaire.

A history of drug use. Picked up
multiple times for solicitation.

33:42.013 --> 33:46.615

their only son Trey on his own.

cocktail of heavy medications

for sleepwalking.

33:58.429 --> 34:00.496
This must be the unsub.
His father's death

34:00.498 --> 34:02.431
could explain why he
started killing now.

34:02.433 --> 34:03.833
Oh, poor kid.

34:03.835 --> 34:05.868
It looks like during a
police raid of a brothel,

34:05.870 --> 34:08.504
then 8-year-old Trey
was found in a bedroom

34:08.505 --> 34:10.339
with a naked prostitute,

34:10.341 --> 34:13.109
and his dad was, um, busy,

34:13.110 --> 34:14.275
in another room.

34:14.277 --> 34:15.911
That's a big stressor.

34:15.913 --> 34:17.713
So when Trey's dad died,
he went after any poacher

34:17.715 --> 34:19.181
that reminded him of the guy.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.983
That must have not been enough, right?

34:20.985 --> 34:23.152
And while he slept,
his mind pulled him back

34:23.154 --> 34:24.920
to those houses he used to go to.

34:24.922 --> 34:27.056
Ok, I'm sending you Trey's
address. It's on your tablets.

34:27.058 --> 34:28.623
The house where he was molested,

34:28.626 --> 34:30.556
has he killed there yet?

34:30.594 --> 34:32.661
That would be a... no.

34:32.663 --> 34:35.563
Ok, send us that address.
He may be headed there now.

35:06.097 --> 35:07.463
Uh, yes.

35:07.465 --> 35:09.131
This is Emily Prentiss.
I'm with the FBI.

35:09.133 --> 35:11.000
I need you to listen very carefully.

35:11.002 --> 35:14.303
Someone may come to your
door or try to get in.

35:14.305 --> 35:15.504
[Knocking]

35:15.506 --> 35:16.906
Someone's knocking now.

35:16.908 --> 35:18.541
Janis, do not open the door.

35:18.543 --> 35:19.842
Do you understand me?

35:19.844 --> 35:22.011
Yes, I...

35:22.013 --> 35:23.379
[Screaming]

35:23.381 --> 35:26.049
Janis? Janis?!

35:30.629 --> 35:32.285
He's inside! He's inside!

35:32.512 --> 35:33.978
Get out of the house.

35:33.980 --> 35:35.413
He's blocking the exit!

35:35.415 --> 35:37.682
Ok, hide. Lock yourself into a room.

35:37.684 --> 35:39.035
We're on our way.

35:41.321 --> 35:43.154
I'm in the bathroom. Please hurry.

35:43.156 --> 35:45.256
We're almost there, I promise.

35:45.658 --> 35:47.091
[Banging]

35:47.093 --> 35:48.760
[Crying]

35:48.762 --> 35:50.461
Please hurry.

35:50.463 --> 35:54.132
[Sobbing]

35:54.134 --> 35:55.600
Please help me.

35:56.536 --> 35:58.403
[Sobbing]

35:58.405 --> 36:01.739
[Siren]

36:06.212 --> 36:07.845
[Cocking weapons]

36:07.847 --> 36:10.969
Walker: One way or another,
this is gonna stop him.

36:11.651 --> 36:14.552
[Screaming, sobbing]

36:22.128 --> 36:23.961
FBI! Drop the knife!

36:30.203 --> 36:32.370
Still sleeping.

36:50.023 --> 36:51.856
Trey?

36:52.591 --> 36:55.358
Here. I'm here.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.093
You know where you are?

36:59.298 --> 37:02.299
This is where I was...

37:02.301 --> 37:06.069
This is not what I... I...

37:06.071 --> 37:07.704
I did it again.

37:08.407 --> 37:11.274
This was not supposed to happen.

37:11.276 --> 37:15.545
Please, I need help. Can you help me?

37:15.547 --> 37:18.448
We're gonna try.

37:20.485 --> 37:22.085
Trey Gordon, you're under arrest

37:22.087 --> 37:23.136
for the murder of 8 people.

37:23.136 --> 37:25.153
8?

37:25.557 --> 37:27.490
You have the right to remain silent.

37:27.492 --> 37:29.192
Anything you say can and will

37:29.194 --> 37:31.890
be used against you in a court of law...

37:43.275 --> 37:45.909
Lewis: “How blessed are some people,

37:45.911 --> 37:48.945
“whose lives have no fears, no dreads,

37:48.947 --> 37:52.148
“to whom sleep is a
blessing that comes nightly

37:52.150 --> 37:55.285
and brings nothing but sweet dreams.”

37:55.287 --> 37:56.732
Bram Stoker.

37:59.057 --> 38:01.224
[Beeping]

38:02.895 --> 38:03.894
Hey.

38:03.896 --> 38:05.896
Hey.

38:05.898 --> 38:09.333
Oh. Hello. It's you.

38:10.448 --> 38:11.348
How was Vermont?

38:11.564 --> 38:13.081
Vermont was, uh, was great.

38:14.567 --> 38:17.167
I found, uh, this.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.368
[Toy squeaks]

38:18.370 --> 38:19.570
For your desk.

38:19.572 --> 38:22.606
And for those future stressful days.

38:22.608 --> 38:24.041
[Squeaking]

38:24.043 --> 38:25.676
[Chuckles]

38:25.678 --> 38:26.643
Oh.

38:26.645 --> 38:28.011
- [Squeaking]
- Ha ha.

38:28.013 --> 38:29.246
I don't... I don't I have this one.

38:29.248 --> 38:31.849
[Squeaking]

38:31.851 --> 38:33.016
Thank you.

38:33.018 --> 38:34.818
You're welcome.

38:36.555 --> 38:38.155
How are you doing?

38:38.157 --> 38:40.757
Uh, good.

38:40.759 --> 38:42.626
Yeah, I just want to say,

38:42.628 --> 38:45.329
if I ever do become the someone

38:45.331 --> 38:47.598
you want to go to when you're crying,

38:47.600 --> 38:50.133
uh, I'm here.

38:50.135 --> 38:52.569
Just, I figured, you
know, after the time

38:52.571 --> 38:54.137
we chased down the unsub,

38:54.139 --> 38:56.240
and now with you opening up to me

38:56.242 --> 39:00.978
about your concerns
regarding Reid, that, uh...

39:00.980 --> 39:04.281
Well, maybe there was
just a slight chink

39:04.283 --> 39:06.416
in your fluffy armor.

39:06.418 --> 39:07.551
It was luck.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.552
It was timing.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.621
I cry all the time.

39:10.623 --> 39:12.968
I'm a very sensitive person.

39:14.460 --> 39:17.728
I am glad you're here, ok?

39:17.730 --> 39:21.131
But I am never going to
stop giving you crap, Luke.

39:22.701 --> 39:24.134
Hey. Penelope.

39:24.136 --> 39:26.470
Hmm?

39:26.472 --> 39:28.272
You know, that's the first time...

39:28.274 --> 39:29.273
Shut it.

39:29.275 --> 39:30.474
You didn't call me by...

39:30.476 --> 39:32.643
Let's be in the moment.

39:33.979 --> 39:36.847
[Buzzer]

39:41.120 --> 39:42.953
Stop! Stop!

39:42.955 --> 39:44.922
Nah, nah, no more orders
from you, little man.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.590
Maybe we can't get to you,

39:46.592 --> 39:47.691
but we can get to your friend.

39:47.693 --> 39:49.126
Let him go!

39:49.128 --> 39:50.427
So here's lesson number one.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.996
I know Shaw got your
back, but I'm in charge.

39:52.998 --> 39:55.432
In two weeks, my
shipment's coming through,

39:55.434 --> 39:57.367
and you're gonna make
sure it gets to me safely.

39:57.369 --> 39:58.368
Is that clear?

39:58.370 --> 40:00.003
Delgado: Spencer...

40:00.005 --> 40:02.205
Is that clear?

40:02.207 --> 40:03.373
Yes, it's clear, it's clear.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.808
Lesson number two...

40:04.810 --> 40:07.911
Never, ever, mess with a
man's stash on the inside.

40:07.913 --> 40:09.913
When you do...

40:09.915 --> 40:11.248
[Delgado gasps]

40:11.250 --> 40:12.749
People get hurt.

40:12.751 --> 40:15.686
Luis.

40:15.688 --> 40:17.287
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.822
I'm sorry. It's ok.

40:18.824 --> 40:19.823
Guard!

40:19.825 --> 40:23.360

40:23.362 --> 40:25.429
Help!

40:25.431 --> 40:27.231
