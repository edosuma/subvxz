00:44.045 --> 00:45.125
Maud, where are you?

00:46.645 --> 00:47.525
I miss you.

00:54.525 --> 00:56.045
I'll take you out soon, Star.

01:06.085 --> 01:07.085
Okay then.

01:11.965 --> 01:13.045
{\an8}What is it boy?

01:21.005 --> 01:22.405
Maud's wrist band?

01:34.965 --> 01:37.565
Oh, what? Who did that?

01:38.325 --> 01:40.685
Now, that's what I call a birthday party.

01:40.765 --> 01:41.845
Look at my room.

01:41.925 --> 01:45.445
What's happening? I can't see.
My eyes aren't working!

01:47.125 --> 01:48.165
Oh.

01:49.645 --> 01:50.485
Oh!

01:52.925 --> 01:54.005
Whose cat is that?

01:54.525 --> 01:56.485
Um, what's that on the floor?

01:58.405 --> 02:00.365
Instant cake potion.

02:01.965 --> 02:05.325
I thought you said you made my cake
the non-magical way.

02:06.805 --> 02:08.445
My cat's not in there,
is she?

02:12.565 --> 02:13.924
My cat? Arcana?

02:14.005 --> 02:16.325
She chased a mouse up here
and now I can't find her.

02:16.405 --> 02:18.325
Nope. I haven't seen her, Miss Drill.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.565
Well, if she turns up
hold on to her for me.

02:20.645 --> 02:21.525
Or try.

02:22.045 --> 02:24.285
Won't sit still for a second
that one.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.125
Not a problem at the moment.

02:33.525 --> 02:35.725
Oh, come to help out ahead of lessons?

02:35.805 --> 02:37.565
I've still got outbuildings to do.

02:38.405 --> 02:39.845
Mum, have you seen Maud?

02:40.525 --> 02:42.405
Nobody's spoken to her since yesterday.

02:42.485 --> 02:43.325
Hmm.

02:43.405 --> 02:44.925
Or Ethel, or Felicity.

02:45.005 --> 02:46.445
Well, they can't be far away.

02:47.565 --> 02:53.005
It's just that, Maud had this crazy idea
that you might still be magical.

03:00.925 --> 03:04.965
If I'm still magic, then where's
my never-ending ice cream?

03:08.485 --> 03:09.325
Sorry, Mum.

03:10.205 --> 03:11.445
Why don't you go and look for Maud,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.925
and Enid can stay here and help me
with the outbuildings?

03:14.005 --> 03:14.965
Okay.

03:16.085 --> 03:17.565
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.125
That was a bit cheeky.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.845
What you were getting at, Enid.

03:35.165 --> 03:37.005
Just going for more volunteers.

03:52.285 --> 03:53.245
Enid?

04:05.085 --> 04:06.685
I'm sure they weren't there before.

04:10.045 --> 04:10.885
Maud.

04:11.645 --> 04:12.765
It can't be you.

04:13.325 --> 04:15.765
Mum gave up her magic, I saw her.

04:16.644 --> 04:17.485
I...

04:22.045 --> 04:22.925
Felicity?

04:23.565 --> 04:24.404
Miss Bat.

04:25.325 --> 04:26.485
Miss Tapioca.

04:33.765 --> 04:36.925
Miss Cackle, I wanted to talk to you
about extending the art curriculum.

04:37.005 --> 04:40.525
I'm sorry, Miss Hubble. I have just
woken up to some alarming reports.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.805
It seems we are missing pupils and staff.

04:42.885 --> 04:44.125
Yes, but about the curriculum.

04:44.205 --> 04:47.125
Miss Hubble, it will have to wait!

04:51.005 --> 04:53.325
Miss T will definitely know
how to fix this.

04:53.405 --> 04:54.365
She's not here.

04:54.445 --> 04:56.845
Must have tried transporting herself
to the shop.

04:56.925 --> 04:59.645
So, as there's no breakfast,

04:59.725 --> 05:01.765
you could at least share your cake.

05:01.845 --> 05:03.965
This cake, it's...

05:04.445 --> 05:05.565
It's for Miss Drill.

05:05.645 --> 05:07.805
How come? She's had her birthday.

05:08.325 --> 05:09.645
-It's--
-It's her leaving gift.

05:09.725 --> 05:10.965
Miss Drill's leaving?

05:11.045 --> 05:12.125
Um, well...

05:12.205 --> 05:14.205
Miss Drill's one of the best teachers,

05:14.285 --> 05:16.405
and one of my best customers.

05:16.805 --> 05:18.285
I can't believe it.

05:19.565 --> 05:20.805
Leaving gift?

05:20.885 --> 05:21.885
Miss Hardbroom!

05:22.765 --> 05:23.805
Yes?

05:23.885 --> 05:24.885
The wishing star...

05:25.645 --> 05:26.805
it didn't get broken.

05:27.965 --> 05:28.965
I took it.

05:30.565 --> 05:31.405
What?

05:32.125 --> 05:33.965
I used it to make my mum magical.

05:36.325 --> 05:37.965
I thought she had given up her powers...

05:38.045 --> 05:40.965
...but I was wrong
and now she's turning people tiny

05:41.045 --> 05:44.605
and putting them into her clay model
and I don't know why she'd do that.

05:50.565 --> 05:51.885
Miss Hardbroom?

05:53.205 --> 05:54.245
I'm sorry.

06:00.405 --> 06:02.365
It's really them, isn't it,
Miss Hardbroom?

06:03.085 --> 06:04.645
But you can get them out again, can't you?

06:13.965 --> 06:15.365
The neutralizing spell.

06:15.925 --> 06:18.085
No magic will work here
until it is lifted.

06:19.405 --> 06:20.805
My mum did that?

06:20.885 --> 06:22.925
You fail to understand what is happening.

06:23.445 --> 06:27.325
Magic given to a non-magical person
is almost impossibly powerful.

06:27.965 --> 06:28.885
Like a runaway train.

06:28.965 --> 06:30.685
But then we tell her to take it off again.

06:31.645 --> 06:32.965
It's my mum, she'll listen.

06:33.045 --> 06:34.205
She will not.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.285
You have no idea what you have done.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.405
You must see it with your own eyes.

06:43.485 --> 06:44.405
See what, Miss Hard--

06:45.885 --> 06:47.005
Who's that meant to be?

06:48.325 --> 06:50.805
To answer that I must tell you
of another young witch.

06:51.485 --> 06:54.205
-A witch named Joy.
-Miss Hardbroom, we have--

06:54.285 --> 06:56.045
<i> Magic came easily to Joy.</i>

06:56.125 --> 06:59.045
<i>So easily she believed she knew better</i>
<i>than other witches.</i>

06:59.125 --> 07:02.405
She believed that the code
did not apply to her.

07:03.285 --> 07:08.005
In particular the warning to stay away
from the non-magical world.

07:09.405 --> 07:12.765
<i>Joy was drawn to the simple things</i>
<i>which she had never known.</i>

07:12.845 --> 07:14.565
<i>Ice cream, music</i>

07:15.245 --> 07:16.165
<i>and most of all...</i>

07:18.485 --> 07:19.445
<i>dancing.</i>

07:22.445 --> 07:26.245
<i>Today we can lift the spell which</i>
<i>makes us invisible to ordinary people.</i>

07:28.285 --> 07:29.805
<i>Back then it was impossible.</i>

07:30.565 --> 07:34.245
<i>So, Joy found herself enchanted</i>
<i>by the non-magical world,</i>

07:34.325 --> 07:35.645
<i>but all alone.</i>

07:36.405 --> 07:37.965
<i>No one could see her.</i>

07:40.045 --> 07:42.685
<i>Until the day that she met...</i>

07:43.765 --> 07:45.165
<i>Indigo Moon.</i>

07:46.325 --> 07:47.845
Out of the way,
get out of the way!

07:47.925 --> 07:49.365
No brakes, get out of the way!

07:49.445 --> 07:51.245
-You can see me?
-Woah!

07:55.405 --> 07:56.245
Are you alright?

07:56.325 --> 07:57.165
Oi!

07:57.885 --> 07:58.765
Run!

07:58.845 --> 07:59.885
Get back here!

08:03.005 --> 08:04.365
Why was he chasing you?

08:04.445 --> 08:05.565
Oh...

08:05.645 --> 08:08.325
just because I do magic tricks
for the tourists for pennies.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.405
Come on.

08:14.405 --> 08:15.605
This is where you live?

08:15.685 --> 08:17.325
No. It's just my den.

08:21.845 --> 08:22.765
Now you see it.

08:26.605 --> 08:27.645
Now you don't.

08:28.405 --> 08:29.445
Oh, but...

08:29.525 --> 08:30.565
What's that in your pocket?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.044
Okay, needs some practice.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.885
That's supposed to be magic?

08:39.245 --> 08:42.284
Hey, magic's real,
as long as you believe in it.

08:44.245 --> 08:45.965
So that's how you can see me.

08:48.285 --> 08:52.445
<i> She and Indigo Moon</i>
<i>became the best of best friends.</i>

08:55.285 --> 08:58.645
<i>And they swore that nothing</i>
<i>would ever separate them.</i>

09:04.005 --> 09:05.005
<i>And then...</i>

09:06.485 --> 09:07.885
<i>the teachers found out.</i>

09:10.445 --> 09:13.525
They allowed Joy to stay at Cackle's
on one condition:

09:13.605 --> 09:16.725
She be magically confined there
from that day on.

09:16.805 --> 09:19.885
I feel very sorry for her, Miss Hardbroom,
but why is that important right now?

09:19.965 --> 09:21.245
Because, Mildred Hubble,

09:21.325 --> 09:23.925
one half-term
when Joy was more lonely than ever,

09:24.005 --> 09:25.405
she hatched a plan.

09:27.285 --> 09:28.765
If she could not go to Indigo...

09:29.965 --> 09:31.965
then Indigo would come to her.

09:37.765 --> 09:39.885
<i> Just as you did,</i>
<i>she stole a wishing star.</i>

09:41.325 --> 09:42.445
<i>And just as you did,</i>

09:42.525 --> 09:46.285
<i>she used it to cast</i>
<i>the most forbidden spell of all.</i>

09:47.085 --> 09:52.165
Bring this loneliness to an end
and make a witch out of my friend.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.205
<i> At first</i>
<i>it was wonderful...</i>

10:20.485 --> 10:22.205
<i>but the spell is forbidden for a reason.</i>

10:23.725 --> 10:24.725
Indie!

10:25.645 --> 10:26.725
Careful!

10:26.805 --> 10:27.885
Indie!

10:32.285 --> 10:34.925
<i>Magic is too much for non-magicals.</i>

10:39.125 --> 10:40.525
They're not tricks, this is real!

10:43.005 --> 10:44.805
Indie, stop it!

10:53.805 --> 10:55.085
Indie, come back!

10:55.165 --> 10:56.205
Indie!

10:56.285 --> 10:58.565
Roll up, roll up, ladies and gentlemen!

10:58.645 --> 11:02.045
Today, I'm going to make
an entire castle disappear.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.005
Indie, there are people in there.

11:04.485 --> 11:07.565
A feat of magical strength,
never before seen.

11:11.725 --> 11:12.685
Indie?

11:12.765 --> 11:13.845
What's happening?

11:17.845 --> 11:18.885
Joy?

11:22.885 --> 11:24.205
Indigo, come back!

11:24.805 --> 11:25.645
Please!

11:50.685 --> 11:52.205
That's Indigo Moon?

11:53.685 --> 11:55.205
That is really her?

11:58.365 --> 12:00.965
Are you saying that's
what's going to happen to my mum?

12:02.005 --> 12:04.085
I am telling you,
so that you are prepared.

12:04.165 --> 12:07.485
I am telling you, so that you know
you are not the only one

12:07.565 --> 12:09.925
who has made this grievous mistake.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.205
I don't believe it.

12:11.925 --> 12:15.205
It's just a story
and that is just a statue.

12:16.885 --> 12:18.085
It is the truth.

12:19.005 --> 12:19.845
I know.

12:19.925 --> 12:22.045
How do you know, Miss Hardbroom?

12:22.125 --> 12:23.965
Because, Mildred Hubble...

12:25.325 --> 12:27.205
my middle name is Hecate.

12:28.525 --> 12:29.645
My first name...

12:31.245 --> 12:32.205
is Joy.

12:36.405 --> 12:37.685
<i> I learnt my lesson.</i>

12:39.445 --> 12:42.445
<i>Never break the</i> Witches' Code <i>.</i>

12:48.365 --> 12:52.365
I cut myself off from my witch friends,
including Miss Pentangle.

12:53.285 --> 12:55.605
I continued to be confined
to the academy

12:55.685 --> 12:57.125
and its grounds.

12:57.205 --> 12:59.605
I have lived with my guilt for 30 years.

13:01.645 --> 13:04.205
I will endeavor to help you
to do the same.

13:11.085 --> 13:13.165
There is nothing we can do
for your mother.

13:15.605 --> 13:16.445
No.

13:20.045 --> 13:21.045
No!

13:26.125 --> 13:28.845
Feather of eagle, tear of bat,

13:29.485 --> 13:31.645
turn now back into a cat.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.605
Dandelion and fenny snake,
no longer shall you be a cake.

13:41.205 --> 13:45.125
Lemon sour and apple tasty,
be a moggy, not a pastry.

13:48.485 --> 13:49.325
What?

13:49.405 --> 13:50.525
I'm desperate, okay?

13:55.405 --> 13:56.645
Just letting you know the plans.

13:56.725 --> 13:58.285
What plans?

13:58.365 --> 13:59.925
For Miss Drill's leaving party.

14:00.765 --> 14:03.565
No, no, I don't think that's a good idea.

14:03.645 --> 14:05.005
Why not?

14:05.085 --> 14:05.965
Because...

14:06.805 --> 14:07.645
Because...

14:09.485 --> 14:10.365
She's been fired.

14:10.445 --> 14:11.645
What?

14:12.325 --> 14:13.925
I am not having that.

14:24.725 --> 14:26.005
Shouldn't you be in class?

14:26.965 --> 14:28.965
Mum. I don't understand.

14:30.285 --> 14:32.085
I thought you gave up your magic.

14:35.965 --> 14:36.805
Well.

14:40.445 --> 14:42.005
It's just so good.

14:42.885 --> 14:44.645
You can have anything you want.

14:44.725 --> 14:47.645
And you want to trap my friends
in a clay prison?

14:48.005 --> 14:49.205
You see, the thing is,

14:49.285 --> 14:54.085
all my life I have had to put up with
so many little annoyances.

14:54.165 --> 14:57.605
Rudeness, lateness, selfishness.

14:57.685 --> 14:58.765
Well, no more.

14:58.845 --> 15:00.885
Any of that, and it's whoosh...

15:01.885 --> 15:04.365
into Ms Hubble's detention.

15:05.965 --> 15:06.845
Permanently.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.925
But... But why? I--

15:09.005 --> 15:11.765
We are going to get this place
running our way, Mildred.

15:11.845 --> 15:15.325
I've already started making improvements
to <i> the Witches' Code</i>, look.

15:17.885 --> 15:19.365
Mum, you sound barmy. Stop.

15:19.445 --> 15:22.645
You see, if only they'd listened to us,
these witches would be a lot better off.

15:22.725 --> 15:24.885
How many times have we saved them,
hey?

15:24.965 --> 15:28.365
Going right back
to great-great-great-granny Mirabelle.

15:30.085 --> 15:30.965
Mirabelle.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.725
Of course.

15:36.445 --> 15:37.445
Mildred?

15:38.685 --> 15:39.725
Mildred!

15:41.605 --> 15:42.445
It's starting.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.005
Mildred.

15:50.885 --> 15:52.845
Save Miss Drill!
Save Miss Drill!

15:52.925 --> 15:53.765
Save Miss Drill!

15:53.845 --> 15:56.045
Right. This stops now.

15:56.965 --> 15:57.845
Mabel!

15:57.925 --> 16:00.165
Everyone! You can't do this.

16:01.245 --> 16:02.325
Why not?

16:02.685 --> 16:05.525
Because, Miss Drill doesn't know
herself yet...

16:05.605 --> 16:07.325
That she's been fired. Okay?

16:07.885 --> 16:11.965
We only know because we overheard
Miss Cackle in the corridor.

16:17.205 --> 16:18.965
Start your warm ups, girls.

16:24.245 --> 16:25.125
Mirabelle!

16:25.205 --> 16:26.205
Are you there?

16:28.525 --> 16:30.725
Tell me you did not confront
your mother in her present state.

16:30.805 --> 16:32.525
Miss Hardbroom, this is my family tree.

16:32.605 --> 16:33.845
My ancestor Mirabelle lives here.

16:33.925 --> 16:37.725
She only ever spoke due to glitching magic
caused by the Founding Stone disaster.

16:37.805 --> 16:39.205
She will not speak now.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.845
Excuse me...

16:41.925 --> 16:43.405
young lady!

16:43.485 --> 16:48.005
I have over 600 years
of witching experience.

16:48.085 --> 16:49.885
I do know some tricks.

16:50.445 --> 16:52.005
Mirabelle, Mum's in danger.

16:52.085 --> 16:54.285
I might have turned her magical
and now I need to know

16:54.365 --> 16:56.005
how to stop her from turning to stone.

16:56.085 --> 16:57.165
Oh, Mildred.

16:57.245 --> 16:59.485
You don't do things by halves, do you?

16:59.565 --> 17:01.045
-Never.
-Do you know how?

17:01.125 --> 17:02.325
We need to hurry.

17:02.405 --> 17:03.765
Mum's already started to change.

17:03.845 --> 17:06.444
Well, of course I know, Mildred.

17:07.605 --> 17:12.005
Remembering what I know, however,
that is another matter.

17:12.084 --> 17:13.885
Try, Mirabelle, please try.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.525
Let me see.

17:15.604 --> 17:17.525
Pip of apple...

17:17.604 --> 17:19.444
No, no, that's for my arthritis.

17:19.525 --> 17:21.165
Toe of snake...

17:22.525 --> 17:23.885
Doesn't even make sense.

17:23.964 --> 17:26.444
Come on, you can do this.
You can do this, come on.

17:26.525 --> 17:27.444
Ah!

17:28.565 --> 17:31.725
Shell of snail, scales of python.

17:32.124 --> 17:35.525
Branch of ivy, rarest lichen.

17:35.605 --> 17:38.365
Mix them up and may this potion,

17:38.445 --> 17:41.845
let those transfixed regain their motion.

17:41.925 --> 17:42.765
That's the cure.

17:42.845 --> 17:44.045
Thank you, Mirabelle.

17:45.525 --> 17:46.845
Rarest lichen?

17:46.925 --> 17:48.365
The magical kind.

17:48.445 --> 17:53.205
Found only on the tallest tree
in forests surrounding magical academies.

17:53.285 --> 17:54.925
- Oh, yes!
- Mildred?

17:56.205 --> 17:57.805
-Go now.
-What about you, Miss Hardbroom?

17:57.885 --> 17:58.805
Go.

17:59.925 --> 18:00.885
Ms Hubble.

18:01.885 --> 18:04.885
What you have done is in breach
of every rule in the Code.

18:04.965 --> 18:07.045
I must insist that you give up
your magic this instant.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.405
Oh, do one, HB.

18:10.485 --> 18:11.685
Mildred?

19:02.605 --> 19:03.725
Hope that's enough.

19:06.965 --> 19:07.965
Mildred.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.245
Remember the golden rule?

19:10.685 --> 19:12.205
Mum knows best.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.085
Mum knows best!

19:31.925 --> 19:33.605
I can't talk right now, girls.

19:34.765 --> 19:36.205
I'm waiting for Miss Cackle.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.365
Miss Drill, there's something
we need to tell you before you do.

19:45.005 --> 19:49.885
It all started when we turned your cat
into a cake.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.125
Scales of python.

20:09.645 --> 20:10.645
Branch of ivy.

20:13.285 --> 20:14.925
Rarest lichen.

20:17.245 --> 20:18.485
Mum, give me that back, please.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.925
Why? So you can take away my magic?

20:21.005 --> 20:22.285
That is not what I'm trying to do.

20:22.365 --> 20:24.485
I'm trying to save you
from being turned to stone.

20:24.565 --> 20:26.525
Oh, lies now, is it?

20:26.605 --> 20:28.365
I'm so disappointed in you, Mildred.

20:28.445 --> 20:31.965
You know, I think some time
in that sculpture might do you good.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.405
No.

20:34.445 --> 20:35.725
No, no, no, Mum!

20:37.045 --> 20:39.005
You're not thinking straight, Mum.
You're not you.

20:44.685 --> 20:45.525
Look, Mum.

20:45.925 --> 20:46.765
Look!

20:49.365 --> 20:51.805
Us, before all this began.

20:55.445 --> 20:56.405
Look, Mum.

21:14.525 --> 21:17.405
Do you remember the time
that I left Ted in the caravan

21:17.485 --> 21:20.125
and we had to drive back like 200 miles
just to get him?

21:20.965 --> 21:23.485
Or the time I gave you a haircut
while you were still asleep?

21:23.565 --> 21:24.965
That was magical, Mum.

21:25.045 --> 21:28.285
My old mum was so, so magical.

21:30.725 --> 21:31.725
Mildred.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.205
What am I doing?

21:37.805 --> 21:38.965
Mum, quick.

21:39.045 --> 21:39.925
Mildred.

21:40.645 --> 21:41.805
Rarest lichen.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.405
Mix them up and let this potion,

21:45.485 --> 21:48.885
let those transfixed regain their motion.

22:16.045 --> 22:18.365
I can't believe you'd leave her alone
in that condition!

22:18.885 --> 22:21.205
We're sorry, Miss Drill. We really are.

22:21.285 --> 22:24.085
You had better hope I can find
a way to change her back.

22:26.525 --> 22:27.405
Arcana.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.005
How?

22:30.085 --> 22:32.605
All those silly fibs for nothing.

22:34.325 --> 22:37.165
One lie leads to another, girls.

22:37.245 --> 22:39.365
You should have told me the truth
at the very start.

22:40.685 --> 22:44.405
But as you did the right thing in the end,
I will overlook it this time.

22:45.725 --> 22:48.725
But I will not overlook that
there has been a party in this room.

22:49.565 --> 22:52.205
Either you can explain that
to Miss Hardbroom,

22:52.285 --> 22:54.045
or it's extra cross country.

22:54.445 --> 22:56.085
For all three of you!

23:02.805 --> 23:05.285
I always hated art.

23:09.285 --> 23:10.845
Don't panic.

23:10.925 --> 23:12.005
I'm fine now.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.685
I'm so sorry.

23:15.005 --> 23:15.885
Millie!

23:16.645 --> 23:18.725
Next time I'll listen to you.

23:19.725 --> 23:21.285
I'll believe that when I see it.

23:21.365 --> 23:22.765
Miss Cackle,

23:22.845 --> 23:26.405
this started because Mildred Hubble
broke the <i> Witches' Code</i>.

23:26.485 --> 23:28.245
-And gave her--
-Thank you, Ethel.

23:29.285 --> 23:30.125
I am aware.

23:30.205 --> 23:33.125
I was honestly just coming back
to undo the spell.

23:33.205 --> 23:36.365
The lichen spell must have worked
the same on them as it did on you.

23:37.045 --> 23:38.005
All out.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.245
Please.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.005
I blame myself.

23:50.885 --> 23:52.405
Miss Hardbroom was right.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.045
I should never have hired
a non-magical teacher.

23:57.365 --> 23:59.965
Obviously, you will need to leave
the premises today.

24:00.645 --> 24:01.725
Miss Cackle?

24:02.125 --> 24:04.685
And you will give up your magic.

24:04.765 --> 24:08.205
Miss Cackle, no.
She's got it in control now. I cured her.

24:08.765 --> 24:10.845
She may have been saved
from turning to stone,

24:10.925 --> 24:13.165
but we cannot know that she is in control.

24:13.245 --> 24:16.125
She is. She's in control.
You can't do this!

24:16.205 --> 24:19.285
You are very close to leaving
this academy with your mother.

24:28.085 --> 24:29.485
I think I can remember.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.525
Take away this precious gift,

24:40.965 --> 24:43.485
the magic which I cast adrift.

24:45.165 --> 24:49.005
I freely end my enchanted hours,

24:50.765 --> 24:54.725
and relinquish now my witches' powers.

25:14.245 --> 25:15.285
It'll be okay.

25:15.845 --> 25:17.525
We don't have to do everything together,
do we?

25:18.445 --> 25:19.525
Hey.

25:20.885 --> 25:24.245
You have got the most amazing future
ahead of you.

25:25.285 --> 25:26.885
You don't need me with you here.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.045
You've got me in here.

25:29.805 --> 25:30.965
It's not the same.

25:32.245 --> 25:35.005
You being a witch,
and me being just a regular mum.

25:36.765 --> 25:38.885
It's not growing apart.

25:39.925 --> 25:40.845
It's growing up.

25:42.445 --> 25:45.845
And whenever you need
your non-magical mum,

25:45.925 --> 25:47.765
she'll be there, like that.

25:48.405 --> 25:51.845
Higher than a broomstick,
faster than a transportation spell,

25:51.925 --> 25:54.125
and that's the most magical thing ever,
isn't it?

25:57.925 --> 26:00.205
Well met, Mildred Hubble.

26:01.485 --> 26:02.325
Well met, Mum.

26:02.965 --> 26:03.805
Come here.

26:06.245 --> 26:08.125
Hey, and listen--

26:11.645 --> 26:13.005
Your mother is now home.

26:13.085 --> 26:15.365
She had lingered long enough.

26:19.605 --> 26:21.565
What about me, Miss Hardbroom?

26:21.645 --> 26:22.805
Miss Cackle is furious.

26:23.645 --> 26:26.885
It is only because she knows that you are
not the first person to make this mistake,

26:26.965 --> 26:29.285
that you will be allowed to stay.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.965
Did you speak up for me?

26:37.405 --> 26:40.445
Miss Hardbroom,
I didn't use all the lichen potion.

26:41.125 --> 26:44.245
There's still enough left to save
Indigo Moon the same way we saved my mum.

26:57.285 --> 27:00.645
It is against the Code
for non-magicals to have magic.

27:00.725 --> 27:02.965
I have not broken the Code
since I was a child.

27:03.045 --> 27:04.205
But we could have saved her!

27:04.285 --> 27:07.125
Her magic made her a danger
to the entire witching world.

27:07.365 --> 27:09.245
We cannot take that chance again.

27:09.325 --> 27:11.765
-She was your best friend--
-She was Joy's best friend.

27:13.085 --> 27:14.805
I am no longer Joy.

27:16.645 --> 27:19.925
I do not want to hear
the name, Indigo Moon...

27:22.365 --> 27:24.765
ever again.
