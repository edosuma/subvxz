00:41.274 --> 00:42.274
Hey.

00:42.773 --> 00:44.356
Ohh!

00:44.358 --> 00:46.224
You scared me.

00:46.226 --> 00:47.910
Sorry.

00:47.912 --> 00:50.496
I hit a wall.

00:50.498 --> 00:52.498
Whoa, oh.
Give me a second.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.083
Well, our time's
almost up, anyway.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.201
Here, let me just show you
a couple of cool-down stretches.

00:56.203 --> 00:57.619
Next time.

00:59.672 --> 01:01.573
You hired me as your
personal trainer, right?

01:01.575 --> 01:02.674
Right.

01:02.676 --> 01:04.543
And here's your training
lesson for today.

01:04.545 --> 01:06.762
Next time needs to be
now time.

01:06.764 --> 01:09.965
It's just...
I got some errands to run.

01:09.967 --> 01:11.934
I'll see you Saturday.

01:11.936 --> 01:13.268
Hey!

01:13.270 --> 01:14.470
- Yeah.
- Terry.

01:14.472 --> 01:16.805
Pain is not gain.

01:16.807 --> 01:17.973
Got it?

01:17.975 --> 01:19.708
I got it.

Every kid loves
trick-or-treating.

02:44.204 --> 02:45.587
Henry's scared.

02:45.589 --> 02:47.756
One of his little buddies told him
Halloween was the only time

02:47.758 --> 02:50.341
when all the real monsters come out
because they can blend in.

02:50.343 --> 02:52.227
Never thought about that.

02:52.229 --> 02:54.479
Good monster strategy.

02:54.481 --> 02:56.714
You did tell him
it wasn't true, right?

02:56.716 --> 02:59.818
Of course I did.
But he's convinced.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.654
Childhood fears are
resistant to adult logic.

03:02.656 --> 03:04.889
Sometimes you just have to
wait it out.

03:04.891 --> 03:06.224
For how long?

03:06.226 --> 03:08.743
Well, if he's 23 and this
still worries you,

03:08.745 --> 03:10.245
you got a problem.

03:10.247 --> 03:13.915
Well, see, the thing is,
I think I am partly to blame.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.033
How?

03:15.035 --> 03:17.018
Well, the other night
will and I were up late,

03:17.020 --> 03:19.578
we were having some wine,
talking about some of

03:19.603 --> 03:21.207
the cases we've worked on,

03:21.208 --> 03:24.125
and at one point, I said
I felt like there was no end

03:24.127 --> 03:27.078
to all the monsters
walking around, and...

03:27.080 --> 03:30.298
Henry sneaked into the room
to listen to the grownups.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.767
Yeah. We need a cone
of silence for our house.

03:34.721 --> 03:37.138
Those of you who like
a good mystery,

03:37.140 --> 03:38.890
please unleash your inner
Agatha Christie,

03:38.892 --> 03:40.725
'cause this one's a real
humdinger.

03:40.727 --> 03:44.712
Gary Ellard, Barry Deaver,
Paul Hicks, Terry Rodgers.

03:44.714 --> 03:46.815
Over the course of the last
month and a half,

03:46.817 --> 03:49.767
these 4 men have gotten
in their cars in La Grande, Oregon,

03:49.769 --> 03:52.487
and drove into the
never-to-be-seen-agains-ville,

03:52.489 --> 03:53.788
poof, gone.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.157
The latest victim Terry Rodgers
disappeared 24 hours ago.

03:56.159 --> 03:58.076
Forensic evidence
point us anywhere?

03:58.078 --> 04:00.662
Uh, point would imply there is evidence,
and there is no evidence,

04:00.664 --> 04:02.213
at least for the first 3
victims.

04:02.215 --> 04:04.448
No forensics, no witnesses,
no ransom demands.

04:04.450 --> 04:06.885
Maybe these guys just
voluntarily decided to hit the road.

04:06.887 --> 04:09.587
4 sudden disappearances
in a community this small--

04:09.589 --> 04:12.056
this isn't about seeking
green pastures.

04:12.058 --> 04:13.791
Based on last known
sightings,

04:13.793 --> 04:15.426
we're dealing with
a sizeable geographic area.

04:15.428 --> 04:16.928
He's efficient
and well organized.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.130
It's not easy to make
4 people vanish and stay vanished.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.932
It has been done before, though.

04:20.934 --> 04:23.818
Political kidnappings frequently require
holding multiple adults simultaneously.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.404
Or they're already dead.
Nothing says "can't be found"

04:26.406 --> 04:28.940
like a shallow grave
in the middle of nowhere.

04:28.942 --> 04:30.692
Assuming they are alive,

04:30.694 --> 04:32.610
how is the unsub
controlling them?

04:32.612 --> 04:33.912
And for what purpose?

04:33.914 --> 04:36.314
The time between abductions is
shortening with each victim.

04:36.316 --> 04:37.815

05:58.302 --> 06:00.085
Garcia, anything on the last
victim, Terry Rodgers?

06:00.087 --> 06:03.005
Only that he's unemployed
and lives in a cabin in the woods.

06:03.007 --> 06:05.324
But primitive, like
no flush toilet primitive.

06:05.326 --> 06:07.592
That doesn't fit the victimology
of the other 3.

Ellard coaches track and field
at a local college,

Deaver's a small business owner,
and Hicks is an attorney.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.016
All married
with young families.

06:14.018 --> 06:15.884
Another difference--
the first 3 victims

06:15.886 --> 06:17.235
were all born and raised
in La Grande.

06:17.237 --> 06:20.022
Terry Rodgers only moved to
town a couple of months ago.

06:20.024 --> 06:21.606
Do you know where from, Garcia?

06:21.608 --> 06:23.642
Rhode Island. Though
there's a 5-month gap

06:23.644 --> 06:25.777
between Terry being
in Rhode Island

06:25.779 --> 06:27.329
and then arriving in Oregon.

06:27.331 --> 06:28.947
Where he was and what
he was doing

06:28.949 --> 06:30.032
is a big fat blank.

06:30.034 --> 06:32.084
It says here that vomit
was found

06:32.086 --> 06:33.835
in the vicinity
of his abduction.

06:33.837 --> 06:34.920
Mm. Thank you for reminding me

06:34.922 --> 06:36.421
of that disgusting detail,
Dreamy D.

06:36.423 --> 06:37.956
Yes, that vomit has been
collected

06:37.958 --> 06:39.374
and is being analyzed
as we speak,

06:39.376 --> 06:40.926
and I'm very grateful
that I have this job

06:40.928 --> 06:42.511
and someone has that one
that's not me.

06:42.813 --> 06:44.562
Rodgers is the obvious
anomaly of the 4,

06:44.564 --> 06:46.931
but there's no apparent overlap
between any of the victims.

06:46.933 --> 06:49.517
Almost like the unsub was
selecting his targets at random.

06:49.519 --> 06:51.987
Blake, you and Morgan go talk to
the families of the victims.

06:51.989 --> 06:54.606
See if there's something that
links them that's not on paper.

06:54.608 --> 06:56.891
Dave and I will go
to the abduction site.

06:56.893 --> 06:59.027
Reid, you and JJ
go to Terry Rodgers' cabin.

06:59.029 --> 07:00.912
He's the one we know
least about.

07:00.914 --> 07:03.281
Maybe he made himself
obscure for a reason.

07:17.913 --> 07:19.264
Sheriff,
I'm Agent Hotchner.

07:19.266 --> 07:20.748
This is Agent Rossi.

07:21.583 --> 07:22.917
Sheriff Colwin.

07:22.919 --> 07:25.420
I am glad
to have your help.

07:25.422 --> 07:26.938
The best we can
reconstruct it,

07:26.940 --> 07:28.723
victim's car
veered off the road

07:28.725 --> 07:30.442
at a low rate of speed,
plowed through the fence,

07:30.444 --> 07:32.944
and ended up in the field.
He managed to get

07:32.946 --> 07:34.729
about 20 feet away
before throwing up.

07:34.731 --> 07:36.731
The photo showed
a second set of tracks.

07:36.733 --> 07:37.899
Were you able to pull
a tread pattern?

07:37.901 --> 07:39.401
We're checking on it
right now.

07:39.403 --> 07:41.870
Maybe our guy got sick
and had to pull over.

07:41.872 --> 07:43.571
Or he was forced
off the road.

07:43.573 --> 07:45.206
Either way, the unsub
was following him.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.574
Mrs. Deaver,
did your husband

07:46.576 --> 07:47.909
give any indication
at all

07:47.911 --> 07:49.160
that something
might be wrong

07:49.162 --> 07:50.378
the night
he disappeared?

07:50.380 --> 07:53.381
No, not at all.

07:53.383 --> 07:54.582
Barry was supposed to coach

07:54.584 --> 07:56.167
our son's little league
game that night.

07:56.169 --> 07:59.804
So he wasn't depressed,
preoccupied?

07:59.806 --> 08:01.089
Nothing.

08:01.091 --> 08:05.093
It was a day
like any other day.

08:09.014 --> 08:12.967
This is what happens
to other people.

08:12.969 --> 08:16.971
You see it on the news,
you know.

08:16.973 --> 08:20.859
Give it, what,
30 seconds of your time?

08:20.861 --> 08:23.411
Shake your head, go back
to whatever stupid thing

08:23.413 --> 08:24.579
you were doing.

08:24.581 --> 08:28.149
Washing dishes
or putting away laundry.

08:28.151 --> 08:32.504
You never think
it's going to happen to you.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.542
Go ahead, you're on
speaker, Garcia.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.928
Sir, I just got the full lab
report for the...

08:39.929 --> 08:41.796
you know, the regur--

08:41.798 --> 08:45.917
for the puke, and there's no
toxins or bacterial infections.

08:45.919 --> 08:48.603
However, Terry Rodgers did have
elevated levels of Melatonin

08:48.605 --> 08:51.473
in his system. And I'm sending
you the full lab report...Now,

08:51.475 --> 08:52.974
on your phones.

08:52.976 --> 08:54.893
Elevated?

08:54.895 --> 08:57.812
His Melatonin levels
are off the chart.

08:57.814 --> 08:59.397
Is that significant?

08:59.399 --> 09:00.565
It's a sedative.

09:00.567 --> 09:03.818
An amount this large
would induce extreme drowsiness.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.821
Do you think he might have
overdosed my accident?

09:06.823 --> 09:08.907
No, no, this was no accident.
The victim was drugged.

09:08.909 --> 09:11.526
Sheriff, the police report said there
were groceries in Rodgers' car.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.194
Do you know if he ate
anything out of the bags?

09:13.196 --> 09:15.530
He didn't. We compared
the supermarket receipt

09:15.532 --> 09:18.299
to what was in the bags.
Nothing missing.

09:18.301 --> 09:19.300
So,

09:19.302 --> 09:20.969
how did Rodgers
unknowingly ingest

09:20.971 --> 09:23.871
such a massive dose
of Melatonin?

09:24.924 --> 09:26.558
You know,
aside from the outhouse,

09:26.560 --> 09:29.394
this cabin isn't so primitive.

09:29.396 --> 09:30.562
Ok.

09:30.564 --> 09:32.230
Economics,

09:32.232 --> 09:34.399
philosophy,

09:34.401 --> 09:36.384
political theory.

09:36.386 --> 09:39.654
It isn't exactly breezy,
take to the beach reading.

09:39.656 --> 09:41.055
I would, but I don't
really like the beach.

09:41.057 --> 09:42.890
Why is that?

09:42.892 --> 09:43.891
Sandy food, pink skin,

09:43.893 --> 09:45.660
limited and unengaging
topography,

09:45.662 --> 09:47.579
but mostly the drug-resistant
bacteria

09:47.581 --> 09:50.081
spread by sea gull feces.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.167
Sorry I asked.

09:52.169 --> 09:53.901
You know, there's a lot
of material here

09:53.903 --> 09:57.038
about global warming,
overcrowding.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.707
The evils of technology.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.677
There's no phone, no TV.

10:02.679 --> 10:05.413
I wonder what this guy
does for fun.

10:05.415 --> 10:08.266
I think maybe I just found
the answer.

10:15.257 --> 10:17.358
Tread marks
were inconclusive.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.561
Probably from
a pickup truck, though.

10:19.563 --> 10:20.728
What's that?

10:20.730 --> 10:23.281
The likely routes
our 4 victims to

10:23.283 --> 10:25.266
on the day they disappeared.

10:25.268 --> 10:26.618
Gary Ellard--

10:26.620 --> 10:28.570
apartment, DMV,

10:28.572 --> 10:32.106
was a no-show for his morning class at
Eastern Oregon University.

10:32.108 --> 10:34.442
Barry Deaver--home, gas station,

10:34.444 --> 10:35.994
never made it
to his karate group.

10:35.996 --> 10:38.634
Paul Hicks--home,
daughter's preschool,

10:38.659 --> 10:39.415
doctor's appointment.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.949
He was supposed to meet
a client over here but never showed.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.953
And we already know
about Terry Rodgers.

10:44.955 --> 10:46.754
And all this
tells you what?

10:46.756 --> 10:48.283
It's more about
what it doesn't tell us.

10:48.308 --> 10:49.791
None of the lines intersect.

10:49.792 --> 10:52.677
I just had a chat with
Terry Rodgers' personal trainer.

10:52.679 --> 10:54.629
She said he never talked
about his private life.

10:54.631 --> 10:56.297
He's shelling out
for a personal trainer?

10:56.299 --> 10:58.182
This is a guy with
no indoor plumbing.

10:58.184 --> 10:59.817
She said he was dedicated.

10:59.819 --> 11:02.353
Not in great shape,
but dedicated.

11:38.174 --> 11:40.391
Hey. You're talking
to the room, P.G.

11:40.393 --> 11:43.861
Mm. If by P.G. You mean
parental guidance strongly advised,

11:43.863 --> 11:45.897
I say P.A., prudent advice.

11:45.899 --> 11:48.983
Ok, here's what's happened.
I checked all the employees and vendors

11:48.985 --> 11:50.952
and delivery people
who work at the supermarket

11:50.954 --> 11:52.570
where Terry Rodgers
bought his groceries,

11:52.572 --> 11:55.156
and there were no red flags.
Also, Barry Deaver, the second victim,

11:55.158 --> 11:56.157
I found his car.

11:56.159 --> 11:57.575
- Where?
- Impounded.

11:57.577 --> 11:59.827
It was abandoned 3 weeks ago
on Fish Hatchery Road,

11:59.829 --> 12:01.362
picked up
by Gus' Towing Service,

12:01.364 --> 12:02.714
where it has been
collecting dust

12:02.716 --> 12:04.582
and racking up storage
fees ever since.

12:04.584 --> 12:05.717
Where's Fish Hatchery Road?

12:05.719 --> 12:08.753
Off the beaten track,
like Terry Rodgers.

12:08.755 --> 12:11.973
Looks like the unsub's
hunting grounds are rural and remote.

12:11.975 --> 12:14.142
Well, to have ended up
there,

12:14.144 --> 12:16.511
Barry Deaver must have
gone on a diagonal, north first,

12:16.513 --> 12:18.746
and then headed west
towards his karate class.

12:45.758 --> 12:47.508
So, did you learn
anything?

12:47.510 --> 12:49.577
Yeah. Spence here
does not like the beach.

12:49.579 --> 12:52.880
I don't. Terry Rodgers
definitely wanted to live off the grid.

12:52.882 --> 12:54.632
A small generator for
minimal electrical needs.

12:54.634 --> 12:56.768
No phone, no TV, no radio.

12:56.770 --> 12:58.770
And lots of material about
the evils of technology,

12:58.772 --> 13:00.888
living healthy off the land,
that sort of thing.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.223
Sounds like the unabomber.

13:02.225 --> 13:04.225
We did find a small stash
of marijuana hidden away.

13:04.227 --> 13:07.095
Did you find any evidence
that a baby lived there or visited there?

13:07.097 --> 13:08.279
Uh, no, why?

13:08.281 --> 13:09.981
I just got the list
of things that he bought

13:09.983 --> 13:11.983
at the supermarket.

13:13.402 --> 13:15.119
4 jars of baby food.

13:15.937 --> 13:17.572
A body matching
Rodgers' description

13:17.574 --> 13:20.141
was found in a river
10 miles out of town.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.715
Easy.

13:27.717 --> 13:31.202
Easy.

13:31.204 --> 13:33.171
Right there.

13:36.175 --> 13:38.559
A fisherman found him
washed up on a bank.

13:38.561 --> 13:43.297
Well, other than the ligature marks on
the wrists and ankles,

13:43.299 --> 13:45.516
there's no signs of
violence or torture.

13:45.518 --> 13:49.654
A lot of care was taken with
the killing and disposing of the body.

13:49.656 --> 13:50.855
Sedation and drowning.

13:50.857 --> 13:54.308
We may have to dramatically
reassess who the unsub is.

13:54.310 --> 13:55.443
What do you mean?

13:55.445 --> 13:57.145
We might be looking
for a woman.

14:06.038 --> 14:07.155
Mommy?

14:07.157 --> 14:08.673
Lexy!

14:08.675 --> 14:12.510
I told you to never
come out here by yourself.

14:12.512 --> 14:13.711
I know, but I'm hungry.

14:13.713 --> 14:15.046
Stay away from the barn.

14:15.048 --> 14:16.748
There's a lot of dangerous
equipment in there.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.000
You could hurt yourself.

14:19.002 --> 14:22.503
Go back to the house
and stay there.

14:22.505 --> 14:24.439
I'll be in to fix you
something.

14:24.441 --> 14:27.225
But I mean it--
stay there.

14:28.277 --> 14:30.027
Ok.

15:18.109 --> 15:20.458
There's got to be something else
that links these victims.

15:20.558 --> 15:21.557
They were all athletic.

15:22.153 --> 15:24.036
Ellard teaches track and field.

15:24.038 --> 15:25.937
Deaver has a martial arts
studio.

15:25.939 --> 15:29.575
Paul Hicks had tendonitis
from playing competitive tennis.

15:29.577 --> 15:31.210
But Rodgers' trainer said
that he was out of shape.

15:31.212 --> 15:33.295
Did the medical examiner
determine Rodgers' time of death?

15:33.297 --> 15:36.114
3 hours from when
he was found at the river.

15:36.116 --> 15:40.469
So the unsub kept Rodgers alive
for the entire day before drowning him.

15:40.471 --> 15:41.753
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:41.755 --> 15:43.922
Ok. I've got something.
That's really bugging me.

15:43.924 --> 15:45.983
I can't figure out
what Terry Rodgers was doing

15:46.008 --> 15:47.126
those missing 5 months.

15:47.127 --> 15:49.461
I mean, you can't sit on
a park bench in this country

15:49.463 --> 15:50.762
and not leave
a paper trail.

15:50.764 --> 15:51.780
But you figured it out.

15:51.782 --> 15:52.964
No. This is me venting.

15:52.966 --> 15:54.799
What I did figure out
was what Terry Rodgers

15:54.801 --> 15:57.802
was doing in Rhode island
before he went awol. Check it.

15:57.804 --> 16:00.072
He was married, divorced,
married again,

16:00.074 --> 16:02.226
currently way behind
on child support payments

16:02.251 --> 16:03.833
to wife number two,
and that's all I know.

16:03.834 --> 16:06.052
If you'll excuse me,
I have more digging to do.

16:06.780 --> 16:07.904
Owes child support.

16:07.929 --> 16:10.414
Could explain why Rodgers
vanished for 5 months.

16:10.416 --> 16:13.165
And why he lived
off the grid. Hard to find.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.811
And that's what links him
to the other victims.

16:14.814 --> 16:16.165
They all fathered children.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.092
We believe the unsub
that we're looking for

16:20.094 --> 16:22.077
is a woman, who is
highly organized,

16:22.079 --> 16:23.595
she's thorough,
and she's patient.

16:23.597 --> 16:25.964
Based on the complexity and
the sophistication of the abductions,

16:25.966 --> 16:29.134
we think she is most likely
between the ages of 30 and 40.

16:29.136 --> 16:30.775
She's familiar
with the rural area

16:30.800 --> 16:32.755
surrounding La Grande.

16:32.756 --> 16:34.723
Either a native or someone
who's lived there for a while.

16:34.725 --> 16:36.558
We think she's
keeping her victims in isolation

16:36.560 --> 16:39.511
in the countryside, which means
she has access to land or a structure

16:39.513 --> 16:41.647
that is remote, hidden,
and private.

16:41.649 --> 16:43.682
She's abducting exceptionally
health conscious men,

16:43.684 --> 16:46.351
ideal specimens, if you will.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.204
Specimens. For what?

16:49.206 --> 16:50.656
Possible breeding.

16:50.658 --> 16:52.491
Ability to father
children is something

16:52.493 --> 16:54.192
we think she's looking for
in her victims.

16:54.194 --> 16:56.795
They're all age appropriate,
and they are all fathers.

16:56.797 --> 16:58.547
But why kill
the last victim?

16:58.549 --> 17:00.299
She may have seen him
as being flawed.

17:00.301 --> 17:02.217
He was the least
physically fit of the 4,

17:02.219 --> 17:04.051
and he neglected to pay
child support.

17:04.054 --> 17:05.837
Making him
undesirable.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.923
The victims may be
surrogates for a man that she wants

17:07.925 --> 17:09.141
but she cannot have.

17:09.143 --> 17:10.675
Because she killed
the last victim,

17:10.678 --> 17:12.210
we have to consider
the possibility

17:12.212 --> 17:16.147
that the unsub is engaged
in some sort of elimination process.

17:16.150 --> 17:18.150
Preselecting a handful
of prime candidates

17:18.152 --> 17:20.402
and then whittling them down
one by one

17:20.404 --> 17:23.488
until she has her ideal
breeding partner.

17:23.490 --> 17:26.391
And if this is the case,
the the killing's just begun.

17:57.941 --> 18:02.027
Mommy,
what's the matter?

18:05.098 --> 18:07.098
We got a frequent flier.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.099
Which one?

18:08.101 --> 18:09.751
The tomato lady.

18:19.128 --> 18:22.130
I don't believe this.

18:23.616 --> 18:24.633
Emma.
Dr. Gourse.

18:24.635 --> 18:25.801
Thank God you're here.

18:25.803 --> 18:27.886
Those other doctors
don't understand my history.

18:27.888 --> 18:29.388
Yeah, I thought we talked
about this last time.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.424
Yeah, we did. But the scleroderma
came back. Look.

18:35.294 --> 18:37.128
There's nothing
on your arm.

18:37.130 --> 18:41.266
But it's right there.

18:41.268 --> 18:43.185
You treated me after my husband died.
It's the same thing.

18:43.187 --> 18:45.237
Yeah, your scleroderma
was treated successfully.

18:45.239 --> 18:47.272
You are fine now.

18:47.274 --> 18:48.573
But this could be
a mutation.

18:48.575 --> 18:51.827
Things mutate. What about
Stevens-Johnson syndrome?

18:51.829 --> 18:54.446
Stevens-Johnson
is extremely rare.

18:54.448 --> 18:57.482
And you'd have severe blistering
all over your face.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.285
Emma, we talked before
about how a delusion--

19:00.287 --> 19:01.753
I'm not crazy.

19:01.755 --> 19:03.872
Emma, listen to me.
There may be other issues

19:03.874 --> 19:06.658
that are going on with you.
Did you contact the therapist

19:06.660 --> 19:08.260
that I recommended?

19:08.262 --> 19:10.846
I guess that's no.

19:15.885 --> 19:19.671
I'm still waiting on the full
M.E. report on Terry Rodgers.

19:19.673 --> 19:21.840
They say they want to retest
some of the findings.

19:21.842 --> 19:22.841
Did they say why?

19:22.843 --> 19:23.842
No.

19:23.844 --> 19:25.727
I recognize that scowl,
Aaron.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.446
What are you thinking?

19:27.448 --> 19:28.730
Something Garcia said earlier

19:28.732 --> 19:30.949
about not being able to sit
on a park bench in this country

19:30.951 --> 19:32.384
without leaving a paper trail.

19:32.386 --> 19:34.035
And...

19:34.037 --> 19:36.204
So what if Rodgers wasn't in
the country for those 5 months?

19:36.206 --> 19:39.291
It wouldn't be the first time
someone crossed borders

19:39.293 --> 19:40.876
to get away from troubles.

19:40.878 --> 19:43.628
Guys, there's something
interesting about this grocery list.

19:43.630 --> 19:44.696
What?

19:44.698 --> 19:46.081
Look at the items
he bought in bulk.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.049
Garlic, green tea,
vitamin D, ginger.

19:48.051 --> 19:50.969
All of these items are specifically known
to boost the immune system.

19:50.971 --> 19:54.089
What if Terry Rodgers
was seriously ill?

19:54.091 --> 19:55.540
What about the baby food?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.976
A side effect of radiation treatment
is sores inside the mouth.

19:57.978 --> 20:00.545
In fact, doctors advise you
to eat the way an infant would eat.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.047
Chemotherapy?

20:02.049 --> 20:04.599
The marijuana in the cabin
could have been medicinal.

20:04.601 --> 20:06.685
I'll have Garcia check
medical facilities outside the country.

20:06.687 --> 20:08.820
And, Reid, you and JJ
go to the medical examiner

20:08.822 --> 20:12.858
and have them look specifically
for a pre-existing condition with Rodgers.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.242
Hotch. You were right.

21:04.244 --> 21:07.612
Back in June, Rodgers checked
himself into an experimental clinic

21:07.614 --> 21:09.948
in Mexico. Cancer.

21:09.950 --> 21:13.168
That's why the unsub
disposed of him so quickly.

21:18.808 --> 21:21.009
It was Hodgkin's lymphoma.

21:21.011 --> 21:23.261
Did you find any sedatives
in his system?

21:23.263 --> 21:25.430
The question is,
what sedatives didn't we find?

21:25.432 --> 21:28.600
Melatonin, Valerian,
marijuana,

21:28.602 --> 21:31.603
hops, catnip,
kava-kava...

21:31.605 --> 21:32.938
Bone meal and kelp.

21:32.940 --> 21:34.606
In the victim's stomach,
along with some materials

21:34.608 --> 21:36.992
that we're retesting.
Take a look at the bottom.

21:36.994 --> 21:39.310
Sawdust residue
caked in the nostrils?

21:39.312 --> 21:40.495
Not just any sawdust.

21:40.497 --> 21:42.864
Pure pinewood pellet
sawdust.

21:42.866 --> 21:45.867
It's usually imported from China.
Was it a 0.5% mixture?

21:45.869 --> 21:47.519
I don't know.

21:47.521 --> 21:49.654
All I know is,

21:49.656 --> 21:50.989
it's not your everyday

21:50.991 --> 21:52.824
spread-on-the-floor sawdust.

21:56.512 --> 21:58.547
Yeah.

21:59.382 --> 22:00.665
That was Reid.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.518
They found a half dozen
natural sedatives

22:03.520 --> 22:05.136
in Rodgers' system.

22:05.138 --> 22:07.188
I don't get it.
The unsub's drugging victims

22:07.190 --> 22:09.891
and trusting that they'll conk out
at the right place at the right time.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.444
Why not use a pharmaceutical drug?
Or poison?

22:12.446 --> 22:14.980
Which would be quicker
and a lot more reliable.

22:14.982 --> 22:17.282
Natural holistic elements
must be important to her.

22:17.284 --> 22:19.651
She may have health issues
of her own.

22:31.381 --> 22:32.998
Go ahead, Garcia.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.500
I just hit the trifecta,
but with two things instead of 3.

22:35.502 --> 22:37.201
What is that, a bifecta?

22:37.203 --> 22:38.553
Exacta. What do you got?

22:38.555 --> 22:42.090
Well, that--
anyway, two missing vehicles

22:42.092 --> 22:43.725
not missing anymore.

22:43.727 --> 22:47.345
Paul Hicks' car was found
by some utility workers

22:47.347 --> 22:49.714
an hour ago.
It had rolled off into a ravine.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.434
And Gary Ellard's car
was picked up on a speeding violation

22:52.436 --> 22:54.819
in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

22:54.821 --> 22:55.987
Idaho?

22:55.989 --> 22:58.440
Stolen by some local kids
10 days ago in La Grande.

22:58.442 --> 23:01.026
Car was just sitting by the side
of the road, keys in the ignition.

23:01.028 --> 23:03.411
They made a typically sound
teenage decision,

23:03.413 --> 23:05.246
decided to take it
on a cross-state joyride.

23:05.248 --> 23:06.915
Garcia, I need to know
the exact spot

23:06.917 --> 23:08.617
where the vehicles
were originally found.

23:08.619 --> 23:11.286
On it.

23:33.442 --> 23:34.926
All right, based on
what we just got,

23:34.928 --> 23:36.277
this is the revised
best guess

23:36.279 --> 23:38.279
on the victims' routes
the days they were abducted.

23:38.281 --> 23:40.699
Two intersect here,
the other two here.

23:40.701 --> 23:44.069
And this is where Terry Rodgers
bought his groceries.

23:44.071 --> 23:45.726
It looks like Paul Hicks
might have gone there after

23:45.751 --> 23:47.239
his doctor's appointment.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.406
Now, what was at
the intersection

23:48.408 --> 23:49.774
where Deaver
and Ellard crossed?

23:49.776 --> 23:51.292
That's a shopping center
with a dozen or so businesses.

23:51.294 --> 23:52.460
We're getting a list
right now.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.112
One of our deputies
sighted an abandoned car

23:54.114 --> 23:55.050
on the outskirts of town.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.949
There was a second set
of tire tracks behind it

23:56.950 --> 23:59.801
that matched those found
at Terry Rodgers' abduction site.

24:01.420 --> 24:03.454
Vehicle's registered
to Cheryl Winslow,

24:03.456 --> 24:05.840
4801 Davenport Avenue.

24:08.095 --> 24:10.011
These are all
from a baby shower.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.629
We contacted her husband.

24:11.631 --> 24:13.297
She's due in 3 weeks.

24:13.299 --> 24:16.101
If this is our unsub,
taking a pregnant woman

24:16.103 --> 24:18.069
would be a huge shift
in victimology.

24:18.071 --> 24:20.105
We profiled she was abducting
the men as breeders.

24:20.107 --> 24:21.606
But why take
someone else's baby

24:21.608 --> 24:23.575
if you're planning
on having your own?

24:23.577 --> 24:25.110
Maybe she can't have one
or she lost one.

24:25.112 --> 24:28.113
Ok, so this--
this isn't about fertility,

24:28.115 --> 24:32.650
but the experience these men
would bring as fathers.

24:32.652 --> 24:35.336
Could she be building a family?

24:47.633 --> 24:51.519
Ohh...Oh, please. Oh, please.

24:51.521 --> 24:52.971
What are you doing?!

24:56.860 --> 24:58.276
Keep still.

24:58.278 --> 24:59.861
Oh, my God!

25:10.852 --> 25:12.192
Prep and get her to O.R. 3.

25:12.292 --> 25:13.658
Doctor,
is she gonna make it?

25:13.660 --> 25:15.493
There's been massive blood loss.
She was given a C-section

25:15.495 --> 25:18.212
with a serrated-edge knife,
then crudely stitched back up.

25:18.214 --> 25:20.882
We found her and the baby
in our parking lot.

25:20.884 --> 25:22.250
- How's the baby?
- The child is fine.

25:22.252 --> 25:24.969
It's her I'm worried about.
Excuse me.

26:02.808 --> 26:06.344
Touch-and-go for a while,
but she's going to make it.

26:06.346 --> 26:07.478
Thank God.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.247
It was a crude stitch-up job,

26:09.249 --> 26:10.248
but functional.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.632
Probably what saved her life.

26:11.634 --> 26:14.418
Whoever did this
had some practice somewhere.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.804
You think there'd be any way we
could talk to her? It's very important.

26:16.806 --> 26:19.957
I'm sorry, but the next
24 hours are critical.

26:19.959 --> 26:21.642
- She's heavily sedated.
- I understand.

26:21.644 --> 26:25.279
Her husband's here.
Excuse me.

26:26.348 --> 26:28.649
Our unsub removed the baby,

26:28.651 --> 26:31.118
then returned mother and child
to a hospital.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.620
Baby wasn't due
for 3 more weeks.

26:32.622 --> 26:35.156
If the unsub's trying
to put together the perfect family,

26:35.158 --> 26:37.358
maybe a premature infant
isn't good enough.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.826
Let's hope not.

26:38.828 --> 26:41.996
That means she'll go out looking
for a healthier baby now.

26:42.881 --> 26:45.082
Mommy?

26:51.757 --> 26:54.091
Mommy?

27:19.368 --> 27:21.252
Lexy, get down from there!

27:37.019 --> 27:39.670
That was Hotch.

27:39.672 --> 27:41.505
The doctor told him
the placenta

27:41.507 --> 27:44.692
was scraped completely out
of the victim's uterus.

27:44.694 --> 27:46.227
Every bit of it.

27:46.229 --> 27:49.013
You know, the placenta does carry
special significance in many cultures.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.698
In ancient Egypt,
it had its own hieroglyph.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.851
And the Ibo tribe in Nigeria
considered it to be the child's dead twin.

27:53.853 --> 27:55.352
Well, that would be helpful,

27:55.354 --> 27:58.539
if our unsub was an ancient
Egyptian or Ibo tribeswoman,

27:58.541 --> 28:00.190
but...

28:03.194 --> 28:05.162
I can hear
the high-pitched whine

28:05.164 --> 28:06.998
from your I.Q.
all the way over here.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.032
What is it?

28:08.034 --> 28:09.717
It could be placentophagy.

28:09.719 --> 28:10.885
What?

28:10.887 --> 28:12.303
Consuming it. In the wild,

28:12.305 --> 28:14.088
it's common for animals
to eat their own afterbirth.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.389
It's super rich in nutrients.

28:15.391 --> 28:16.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

28:16.642 --> 28:20.144
So the unsub might have harvested
this last victim...

28:20.146 --> 28:22.096
for food?

28:23.648 --> 28:24.632
Here.

28:24.634 --> 28:26.183
No!

28:26.185 --> 28:27.818
No...

28:27.820 --> 28:30.104
No, please, mommy.

28:30.106 --> 28:34.241
I promise I won't go to the barn again.
I promise.

28:34.243 --> 28:35.576
This is not punishment.

28:35.578 --> 28:37.695
I'm trying to keep you healthy.

28:38.930 --> 28:40.731
No!

28:40.733 --> 28:42.199
No!

28:42.201 --> 28:43.617
Ohh!

28:43.619 --> 28:46.070
What's wrong with you?!

28:46.072 --> 28:50.341
Do you have any idea
what I did to get that for us?

28:51.376 --> 28:52.960
Uhh!

28:58.801 --> 29:00.434
It's ruined.

29:01.803 --> 29:04.722
I'm sorry.

29:06.776 --> 29:09.560
Oh, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

29:09.562 --> 29:11.479
But...

29:17.452 --> 29:19.553
Mommy?

29:21.790 --> 29:24.208
It's about food.

29:24.210 --> 29:26.961
Herbal sedatives, gruel,
and now the placenta.

29:26.963 --> 29:28.479
Ugh. And FYI,

29:28.481 --> 29:29.964
there's no record
of anyone in La Grande

29:29.966 --> 29:31.999
buying that weird kind
of sawdust the M.E. found.

29:32.001 --> 29:33.283
I'll widen the search.

29:33.285 --> 29:34.969
We still need to figure out
how this unsub

29:34.971 --> 29:36.921
was able to drug
all these men.

29:36.923 --> 29:38.722
The southeast intersect
doesn't get us much.

29:38.724 --> 29:40.674
Laundromat,
video rental store.

29:40.676 --> 29:42.426
The other intersect
is the supermarket,

29:42.428 --> 29:44.345
but none of the employees
recognized Paul Hicks.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.796
He never shopped there.

29:45.798 --> 29:49.049
Garcia, what day of the week
were each of the victims abducted?

29:49.051 --> 29:52.186
Let me see. Gary Ellard on a Monday,
Barry Deaver on a Saturday,

29:52.188 --> 29:54.304
Terry Rodgers and Paul Hicks
both on a Thursday.

29:54.306 --> 29:55.823
Is there anything special
that happens

29:55.825 --> 29:57.992
in the vicinity
of the market on Thursdays?

29:57.994 --> 29:59.977
Uh...wow, you've done this
before, haven't you?

29:59.979 --> 30:01.862
Yeah. There's a farmers market
across the street from the supermarket

30:01.864 --> 30:03.030
every Thursday morning.

30:03.032 --> 30:04.314
And where is it today?

30:04.316 --> 30:07.484
Pendleton, about 40 miles north
on Interstate 84.

30:07.486 --> 30:09.520
I'm sending
Blake and Morgan.

30:17.546 --> 30:20.848
Enjoying
your Melatonin bar?

30:20.850 --> 30:23.551
Job's making you
paranoid, Blake.

30:24.653 --> 30:28.522
Well, apparently a lot of people
work this market.

30:28.524 --> 30:31.341
It's not like everybody else
knows everybody else.

30:31.343 --> 30:34.228
I'm gonna get a list of vendors
and launch Garcia anyway.

30:34.230 --> 30:36.397
You can see how
it happened, though.

30:37.199 --> 30:39.200
And Terry Rodgers
got his groceries,

30:39.202 --> 30:42.203
made his way
back to his car...

30:42.205 --> 30:45.139
Grabbed a power drink
on his way home.

30:45.141 --> 30:47.575
He drank it...

30:47.577 --> 30:49.443
and then he tossed it.

30:49.445 --> 30:51.178
Now the Melatonin's
in his system

30:51.180 --> 30:53.797
with no evidence
of where it came from.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.553
Hey, what do you got?

31:16.555 --> 31:17.905
Full toxicology report.

31:17.907 --> 31:19.023
And?

31:19.025 --> 31:21.575
Unlike any tox panel
I've ever seen before.

31:21.577 --> 31:23.027
They found gypsum?

31:23.029 --> 31:25.529
Yeah. Gypsum's rich in sulphur,
a vital plant nutrient.

31:25.531 --> 31:28.115
She's feeding her captives
soil additives?

31:28.117 --> 31:30.334
Seed meals, too.
Look, cotton, flax.

31:38.928 --> 31:40.961
Come on.

31:43.849 --> 31:45.316
It's animal feed.

31:45.318 --> 31:48.102
Why would you treat a human being
like livestock?

31:48.104 --> 31:49.503
People raise cattle
to eat.

31:49.505 --> 31:51.889
The unsub might be using
the placenta as food,

31:51.891 --> 31:54.692
but nothing in the profile
suggested cannibalism.

31:54.694 --> 31:58.495
I mean...unless the sawdust they found
in Terry Rodgers' nose...

31:58.497 --> 31:59.446
What about it?

31:59.448 --> 32:00.981
When livestock die,
animal carcasses

32:00.983 --> 32:02.149
turn into a useful soil
amendment

32:02.151 --> 32:03.651
through the aerobic
biodegration process.

32:03.653 --> 32:05.619
- Like compost.
- Exactly.

32:05.621 --> 32:07.604
You need to add a substrate
high in carbon

32:07.606 --> 32:09.938
to balance the nitrogen,
and one of the most efficient

32:09.963 --> 32:11.042
substrates on earth

32:11.043 --> 32:12.476
is pure sawdust.

32:12.478 --> 32:16.213
She's using her victims
as human fertilizer.

32:43.692 --> 32:45.576
How are you feeling,
honey?

32:45.578 --> 32:47.244
Mm...

32:48.079 --> 32:50.531
This won't hurt you.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.483
I made it all
from roots and herbs.

32:53.485 --> 32:57.538
All it does is help you
take a little nap.

33:04.346 --> 33:07.181
And when you wake up,

33:07.183 --> 33:11.602
you'll be the beautiful
little girl that you are.

33:16.725 --> 33:20.144
Ok, put your arms
around me now.

33:22.030 --> 33:25.316
How are we doing with
the farmers market background search?

33:25.318 --> 33:28.035
Not good. Turns out that people
who grow organic rutabagas

33:28.037 --> 33:30.571
are loosey-goosey
about punching in a time clock.

33:30.573 --> 33:33.157
Sheriff, if we expand
the search of the second intersection

33:33.159 --> 33:35.232
by a few square blocks,
would we find any

33:35.257 --> 33:37.095
markets or restaurants?

33:37.096 --> 33:40.114
There's a health food co-op
3 blocks away.

34:04.906 --> 34:07.941
The soil will heal you.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.420
Sheriff, the surgeon who
operated on Cheryl Winslow

34:26.424 --> 34:28.170
said that whoever did
the C-section might have

34:28.196 --> 34:29.476
done one before.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.960
If she did,
we never heard about it.

34:30.962 --> 34:33.228
Nothing like this has ever
happened in La Grande.

34:33.231 --> 34:35.422
Well, we can keep looking,
expand the search radius

34:35.447 --> 34:36.317
to nearby towns.

34:36.318 --> 34:37.766
What about farms?

34:37.768 --> 34:40.103
My grandparents had a farm
in Pennsylvania.

34:40.105 --> 34:42.822
Once my grandmother
had to deliver a calf by C-section

34:42.824 --> 34:44.474
to a cow
that was in distress.

34:45.777 --> 34:46.775
Go ahead, Garcia.

34:46.777 --> 34:49.112
I have got something.
Emma Kerrigan.

34:49.114 --> 34:51.531
She runs a small
juice and vegetable stand

34:51.533 --> 34:53.333
at the farmers market,
and she works part-time

34:53.335 --> 34:55.001
giving out free samples
at the health food co-op.

34:55.003 --> 34:56.953
I'm sending you her picture now.

34:56.955 --> 34:58.671
That sounds like
our unsub.

34:58.673 --> 34:59.889
Where does she live?

34:59.891 --> 35:01.124
Piping Rock Farms
west of town,

35:01.126 --> 35:02.759
with 100 acres,

35:02.761 --> 35:04.260
belonged to
her husband's family.

35:04.262 --> 35:05.411
Wait, she has a husband?

35:05.413 --> 35:07.814
Had. Died in a car accident
a year and a half ago,

35:07.816 --> 35:10.216
leaving her
and a 10-year-old daughter.

35:10.218 --> 35:11.634
Let's go.

35:19.643 --> 35:21.978
I've got more info
on Emma Kerrigan.

35:21.980 --> 35:24.930
30 E.R. visits
in the past 6 months.

35:24.932 --> 35:26.332
Big-time hypochondriac.
A co-worker says

35:26.334 --> 35:27.967
she didn't eat anything
unless she grew it herself.

35:27.969 --> 35:30.102
To be fair, she did have
an actual skin disease

35:30.104 --> 35:31.621
a couple years ago--
scleroderma.

35:31.623 --> 35:32.772
Garcia, did the E.R. visits

35:32.774 --> 35:34.974
coincide with the death
of the husband?

35:34.976 --> 35:37.777
No. She was sick
with the scleroderma when he died.

35:37.779 --> 35:39.128
Cleared up
a few months later.

35:39.130 --> 35:42.348
The E.R. visits didn't kick in
until the following year.

35:44.501 --> 35:46.469
Please...

36:19.536 --> 36:21.320
Clear.

36:21.322 --> 36:23.089
Clear!

36:23.091 --> 36:25.041
Clear.

36:30.330 --> 36:31.831
What's that?

36:40.524 --> 36:43.151
Garcia, what happened
to Emma Kerrigan's husband's

36:43.176 --> 36:44.228
body after he died?

36:44.229 --> 36:45.678
Uh, cremated.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.863
And what happened
to the ashes?

36:46.865 --> 36:49.866
Obit says they were
planning on spreading his ashes

36:49.868 --> 36:52.285
in the family garden
throughout the 4 seasons.

36:52.287 --> 36:54.687
Renewal, cycle of life,
rejuvenation, that kind of thing.

36:54.689 --> 36:56.155
Garcia, you got a map
of the farm?

36:56.157 --> 36:58.041
Place this size,
we need to narrow the search.

36:58.043 --> 36:59.375
I got the satellite image.

36:59.377 --> 37:00.860
There's two groups
of buildings.

37:00.862 --> 37:02.528
And then there's
a small square patch

37:02.530 --> 37:04.731
next to a barn that
could be a private garden.

37:04.733 --> 37:06.799
All right, let's go.

37:56.917 --> 37:59.919
Hotch. Back garden.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.931
Emma Kerrigan, FBI.

38:11.933 --> 38:14.534
Put your hands
where I can see them.

38:14.536 --> 38:16.602
Emma, put that knife down.

38:16.604 --> 38:20.790
No. My daughter needs this.
Look at her.

38:20.792 --> 38:23.676
Put it down so we can
get her the help she needs.

38:23.678 --> 38:26.045
My daughter
will be dead by then.

38:26.047 --> 38:28.464
I believe you, Emma.

38:28.466 --> 38:30.967
I can see how sick she is.

38:32.136 --> 38:33.536
I talked to your doctor.

38:33.538 --> 38:35.972
Dr. Gourse? You talked
to Dr. Gourse?

38:35.974 --> 38:41.511
Yes. He said Lexy
is too sick for this to work.

38:41.513 --> 38:43.579
This man's blood
won't do anything.

38:47.235 --> 38:50.269
But it has to.
It's all I have left.

38:50.271 --> 38:52.421
No.

38:52.423 --> 38:55.775
No. What can cure Lexy

38:55.777 --> 38:58.444
is what cured you.

38:58.446 --> 39:01.080
Uh...

39:02.082 --> 39:05.084
Funeral homes
are required by law

39:05.086 --> 39:08.671
to keep a portion
of the remains

39:08.673 --> 39:11.991
of those that they cremate.

39:11.993 --> 39:14.994
These are your
husband's ashes.

39:15.846 --> 39:20.516
Only these will make
your daughter well.

39:24.238 --> 39:27.073
Those are his?

39:38.402 --> 39:40.119
It's a miracle.

39:40.121 --> 39:42.187
It's a miracle.

39:54.034 --> 39:57.303
Not bad, Blake.

39:59.056 --> 40:01.140
Not bad at all.

40:07.180 --> 40:08.547
Took a chance.

40:08.549 --> 40:11.834
I mean, I saw
her fireplace there...

40:18.358 --> 40:20.443
Alfred Austin said,

40:20.445 --> 40:25.097
"Show me your garden
and I shall tell you what you are."

40:25.099 --> 40:28.117
I assume you're not
trick-or-treating either?

40:28.119 --> 40:31.520
Ah, none of my treats seem
to want to call me back, Rossi.

40:31.522 --> 40:33.205
Then I'll buy you dinner.

40:33.207 --> 40:34.507
I'm in.

40:34.509 --> 40:37.910
Uh, excuse me, everybody.
I have an announcement to make.

40:37.912 --> 40:39.745
As I'm sure
some of you were aware,

40:39.747 --> 40:42.915
Henry was a little nervous
about going trick-or-treating this year.

40:42.917 --> 40:45.468
But he's decided to go anyway.

40:45.470 --> 40:47.303
Great.
What changed his mind?

40:47.305 --> 40:48.587
The BAU did.

40:48.589 --> 40:50.439
I told him that he should
go out on Halloween

40:50.441 --> 40:53.359
and try to figure out
which monsters are real

40:53.361 --> 40:54.860
and which ones are not.

40:54.862 --> 40:56.662
So he wants to be
a profiler.

40:56.664 --> 40:57.613
Ah.

40:57.615 --> 41:00.616
He wants to be
his favorite profiler.

41:02.819 --> 41:05.437
Wow! Yeah!

41:05.439 --> 41:08.958
Oh, wow!
You look great, Henry.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.275
Put this on here.

41:10.277 --> 41:12.111
Oh, he's official.

41:12.113 --> 41:13.429
Yeah.

41:13.431 --> 41:14.964
Tell him.

41:14.966 --> 41:17.633
E equals MC squared!

41:17.635 --> 41:18.668
Oh, there it is!

41:18.670 --> 41:19.752
Ohh!

41:19.754 --> 41:21.837
The monsters
don't stand a chance.

41:21.839 --> 41:23.639
Oh, I know. Shall we
go get you some candy?

41:23.641 --> 41:24.707
Come on.

41:24.709 --> 41:26.208
Whoo-hoo.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.344
Watch your back, pretty boy.
