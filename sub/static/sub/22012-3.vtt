00:01.335 --> 00:03.071
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
I was unathletic,

00:03.137 --> 00:05.539
uncoordinated,
and extremely lazy-eyed.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.808
Luckily, there was an adult
to help shepherd me

00:07.875 --> 00:10.811
through this difficult time,
my gym teacher, Coach Mellor.

00:10.878 --> 00:14.782
Hustle, hustle!
Build that muscle!
Let's go!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.584
I'm lookin' at you, Goldfarb!

00:16.650 --> 00:21.622
(AS DARTH VADER) Dave Kim,
I am your father!

00:21.689 --> 00:24.058
Ha! Dude! No one's ever
done that before!

00:24.125 --> 00:25.459
MELLOR: And no one will ever
do it again!

00:25.526 --> 00:27.695
Drop and give me 20 burpees!
Now!

00:27.761 --> 00:30.331
ADULT ADAM:
Just when I thought
gym couldn't get worse,

00:30.398 --> 00:32.300
the new school year began
and it did.

00:32.366 --> 00:37.271
All right!
Welcome to third-period gym,
freshmen through seniors.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.741
Now, to any of you younger,
spindly-armed students

00:40.808 --> 00:45.079
worried about the insane
disparity of height and weight
in this class,

00:45.146 --> 00:48.048
I say... What are ya gonna do?

00:48.116 --> 00:50.218
Suggestion, Coach.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.287
Perhaps the younger,
dorkier students

00:53.354 --> 00:55.223
should wear shin guards
and helmets,

00:55.289 --> 00:57.958
because I will bring
the thunder.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.927
Oh, balls.
You're in this class?

00:59.993 --> 01:03.497
Looks like we got ourselves
a classic brother-versus
brother showdown.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.998
No, we don't.
You know it.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.701
This is why I snap on
these blue shorts every day.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.903
Now let's play some
scooter ball!
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

01:09.970 --> 01:13.941
And so Coach pitted me
against my brother
for the next three months,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.809
and each class, it got worse.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.113
Let's go, smaller team!
Get in their face!

01:20.114 --> 01:23.117
(DISTORTED)
Not in my house!

01:25.653 --> 01:27.321
Good job, Goldberg.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.823
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
Barry's vision was
laser-focused on me in gym.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.360
Mine, on the other hand,
was a bit more wandering.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.662
Aah! Where are
your glasses, kiddo?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.063
Your eye's all farkakte.

01:36.130 --> 01:39.767
Broke in gym class.
Now we all got to live
with the lazy eye.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.335
What's that?
Are you talking to me?

01:41.402 --> 01:42.703
No, I was talking to Pops.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.172
Then why are you
looking at me?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.873
I didn't!
This is me looking at you.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.808
No, now you're looking
at Mrs. Butterworth.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.677
I am not!
You're staring
right at her!

01:49.743 --> 01:53.381
Now one eye's staring at me.
I don't know what to do.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.184
Bevy, your son's wonky eye
is ruining breakfast.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.085
Adam,
put your glasses on.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.720
MURRAY: Oh!
You broke them again?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.690
No more glasses!
Those things cost a fortune.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.826
From now on,
you're gonna wear an eyepatch,
like a regular kid.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.862
But this wasn't my fault!
I was targeted in gym class!

02:08.929 --> 02:12.566
Targeted?
Who targeted
my smooshy-tushed baby boy?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.067
'Twas I.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.170
Barry, what have
I told you about
picking on poor Adam?

02:16.237 --> 02:20.241
ADULT ADAM:
Then came the Mom guilt trip
unique to brothers everywhere.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.576
You realize that one day,
I'll be gone,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.778
and the only thing you'll have
is each other.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.880
Oh, pass! He sucks.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.716
I suck?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.451
Even your wandering eye hates
you and wants to leave
your head.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.586
You two are gonna be
best friends forever,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.388
or no Steak-umms
for a month!

02:34.455 --> 02:36.724
Why are you being so mean
to me about this?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.692
Here, schmoo. You can wear
your backup glasses

02:38.759 --> 02:40.894
till I get the broken ones
to LensCrafters.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.531
No! You can't take away
this gift from me.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.399
I finally have a reason
to go to school.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.968
Adam, tell Coach Mellor
you want to be on
Barry's team.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.738
ADULT ADAM:
Ah! Saved by Mama Bear
once again.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.941
Now all I had to do was plead
my case to my bear of a coach.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.476
Okay, party people!

02:55.543 --> 02:57.645
The rubber balls
are wet and molded over,

02:57.711 --> 03:00.948
so today, we will be
playing dodgeball

03:01.014 --> 03:02.350
with lady softballs.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.352
They're large, they're hard,

03:04.418 --> 03:06.153
and they will leave a mark.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.755
Uh, Coach,
quick sidebar?

03:07.821 --> 03:10.491
First of all, son,
you got to take off
the comedy glasses.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.759
We're not
in clown school.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.427
Sadly, these are not
for hilarity...

03:13.494 --> 03:15.396
just to fix a lazy eye.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.465
On that note,
I was thinking maybe

03:17.531 --> 03:19.099
Barry and I can be
on the same team?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.901
Or you can finally
cast off

03:20.968 --> 03:23.103
your self-doubt
and those orthopedic glasses

03:23.170 --> 03:26.039
and make your big bro
suck it on the
court of life.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.508
Solid plan.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.843
However, my mom really wants
us on the same team

03:29.910 --> 03:32.280
to avoid further damage
to my growing body.

03:32.346 --> 03:35.616
Son, the only reason
Barry pummels you
is because you let him.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.286
You got to stop running
and unleash the beast inside.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.020
And don't just do it
for you.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.990
Do it for all the picked-on,
little-dorkus brothers

03:43.056 --> 03:45.293
who cry "No more!"

03:45.359 --> 03:47.661
Now, are you gonna stand up
and be a man

03:47.728 --> 03:50.063
or are you gonna cower
behind your mommy?

03:50.130 --> 03:54.034
You're pitting my babies
against each other on purpose?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.403
Unacceptable!

03:55.469 --> 03:57.170
(WHISPERING)
I'm so sorry.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.906
* I'm twisted up inside

03:58.972 --> 04:02.810
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

04:04.978 --> 04:06.480
* I don't know the future

04:06.547 --> 04:10.117
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

04:10.183 --> 04:12.453
ADULT ADAM: It was October 11,
1980-something,

04:12.520 --> 04:16.256
and Erica was making the most
of a wild Saturday night
on campus.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.458
No, you hang up.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.192
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.161
No, you hang up.
No, you hang up.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.963
No, you hang up!
No...

04:23.030 --> 04:26.233
Oh, my God.
You're actually ruining
Peter Cetera for me.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.336
Just hang up already
before I barf!

04:28.402 --> 04:30.304
Okay,
it's getting late, babe.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.705
We need to hang up for real
this time.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.707
God! It's so hard to hang up!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
Who? Wha' phone?
Hello?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.846
Geoff, I think we fell asleep
on the phone!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.848
Aw. We fell asleep
together?

04:40.914 --> 04:41.849
Son of a bitch!

04:41.915 --> 04:43.451
So much
long-distance charges!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.486
Crap! I'm the one
who called you!

04:45.553 --> 04:46.887
This phone bill's
gonna be insane!

04:46.954 --> 04:49.156
Oh, no! Your dad's
gonna hate me so much!

04:49.222 --> 04:50.458
Money's
his anger flash point!

04:50.524 --> 04:52.192
We got to get
off this phone, Geoff!

04:52.259 --> 04:53.394
Every second costs us!

04:53.461 --> 04:54.595
Hang up!
No, you up!

04:54.662 --> 04:56.029
No, you hang up!
No, you hang up!

04:56.096 --> 04:57.665
Geoff, hang up
the phone!

04:57.731 --> 05:00.000
(SQUEALS)
As Erica's phone bill
was skyrocketing,

05:00.067 --> 05:02.803
my mom was still
coming down hard on Mellor.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.772
I put up with
your macho attitude,

05:04.838 --> 05:08.208
but when it affects my family,
we got big problems.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.577
All right,
here's the deal.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.979
I, too, had a bully
for an older brother,

05:12.045 --> 05:14.181
and, much like Adam,
I never stood up to him.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.249
I was just...too afraid.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.485
You afraid?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.886
You don't know
Nick Mellor.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.588
When we were kids,
he beat me at everything,

05:20.654 --> 05:23.457
football, powerlifting,
Greco-Roman wrestling,
riflery,

05:23.524 --> 05:25.493
downhill running,
kites.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.495
Well, you're grown men now.
Things change.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.031
Well, not for us.
Nick's the defensive
coordinator at Villanova.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.332
And me?

05:32.400 --> 05:35.503
I'm just a glorified
activities advisor

05:35.569 --> 05:37.237
with chicken-cutlet thighs.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.639
Stop.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.908
Your thighs are
very large.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.075
Everyone says so.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.811
The truth is, maybe if
I'd stood up to Nick

05:43.877 --> 05:46.079
when we were younger
I'd be a college coach

05:46.146 --> 05:49.383
and he'd be the one drying out
these moldy old balls.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.818
(FANS WHIRRING)

05:50.884 --> 05:53.421
Can't you just get past it?
He's your family.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.188
You sound like Mama
God rest her soul.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.258
You mean...
She died doing
what she loved, though,

05:58.325 --> 06:00.060
frog squats.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.229
Coach, does your brother
have any idea
what he's done to you?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.697
That's what
Mama asked me,

06:03.764 --> 06:05.866
right before she did
that last ill-advised rep

06:05.933 --> 06:09.403
that sent her to the final
cool-down in the sky.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.139
Oh, Mama, why'd you have to
crush it so hard?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.642
ADULT ADAM: While my mom was
digging into Coach's
tough past,

06:14.708 --> 06:17.511
Erica was making a tough call
of her own.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.213
Hello.
Goldbergses' residence.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.449
Pops don't say
it's me, Erica!

06:21.515 --> 06:23.083
Is that Erica?
Not Erica.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.452
Play it cool!

06:24.518 --> 06:26.520
I need to talk to Dad about
a gigantic phone bill,

06:26.587 --> 06:28.188
but only if he's not cranky.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.389
First off, has he eaten?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.291
A little.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.693
Now a little more.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.828
He's really teasing
that pickle.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.597
Damn it, Al!
Hand it over!

06:36.664 --> 06:38.065
All right,
what'd you do?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.668
Well, I've kind of been
talking to Geoff a lot,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.703
so the next phone bill
might possibly be

06:42.770 --> 06:45.305
a little bit,
extremely high.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.574
Eh. It's only money.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.709
"It's only money"?
"It's only money"?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.310
Yeah, it's only money.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.280
This from the guy who made me
bring my own cream cheese?

06:53.346 --> 06:54.848
You're messing with me,
right?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.316
This is just
a weird mind game?

06:56.383 --> 06:58.719
Look, I know
long distance is hard.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.988
If you happen to talk
on the phone a little bit more

07:01.054 --> 07:03.390
and it makes a big bill,
so be it.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.125
Take the "Yes"
and hang up!

07:05.192 --> 07:07.928
I'm scared,
but I love you, and bye!

07:07.995 --> 07:10.564
Okay, Mur.
What's your angle?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.332
No angle.
I believe in young love.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.701
No, you don't.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.536
Of course I don't!

07:15.603 --> 07:18.639
Do you know what it means
to have the one
lonely freshman girl

07:18.706 --> 07:20.808
who pines for her boyfriend
back home?

07:20.874 --> 07:24.211
Oy, I remember that girl,
Ethel Kominski.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.546
She was the worst.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.781
Yeah!
Now Erica's the worst.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.983
Instead of partying
with frat boys,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.652
she's on the phone
every night

07:31.719 --> 07:33.453
with some yutz
a thousand miles away.

07:33.521 --> 07:37.257
But that's horrible.
What about Erica going out
and having fun

07:37.324 --> 07:39.059
and making mistakes
and living life?

07:39.126 --> 07:40.360
I thought about that.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.129
And then I thought,
"Nah. I'm good."

07:42.195 --> 07:44.364
ADULT ADAM: As my dad
wanted to keep Erica
from college life,

07:44.431 --> 07:47.701
my mom wanted a family reunion
between Coach and his brother.
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

07:47.768 --> 07:50.037
Come on, girls!
High knees! Let's go!

07:50.103 --> 07:51.639
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Come on, 58!

07:51.705 --> 07:53.040
What the hell is that?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.042
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
This ain't Sunday school!

07:55.108 --> 07:58.512
You're as useless
as your communication degree!

07:58.579 --> 08:00.548
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Well, look at that!

08:00.614 --> 08:03.083
A tea party broke out
at a football game!

08:04.117 --> 08:05.753
Get up, Lopez!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.655
I'll say when
you have heatstroke!

08:07.721 --> 08:09.923
That's Mellor's brother?
(CHUCKLES) Look at him!

08:09.990 --> 08:11.592
It's like this coach
ate our coach!

08:11.659 --> 08:13.561
All I see is
a big teddy bear

08:13.627 --> 08:15.262
who aches
for his brother's love.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.631
You know, it's one thing
to mix in with your children.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.067
It's another when it's with
enormous grown strangers.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.069
You may be right.

08:22.135 --> 08:26.039
Take five, guys!
I've got orange slices
and Kool-Aid here.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.541
Help yourselves.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.076
Oh.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.944
Spit it out.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.780
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Blondie?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.348
I'm here to bring
the Mellor boys back together.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.418
It's time to fix things
with Coach Rick, Coach Nick.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.188
My brother? (SCOFFS)
Pass!

08:41.254 --> 08:42.690
Not you, Chandler!

08:42.756 --> 08:45.358
Nice toss, Chandler!
I bet your mama's very proud.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.928
You're not gonna leave
here until I agree to
come with you, are you?

08:47.995 --> 08:51.431
That's right.
Beverly Goldberg
never backs down.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.567
Also, I'm extremely
intrusive.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.968
Orange slice?

09:04.578 --> 09:06.614
Okay, those are meant
to be shared.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.783
ADULT ADAM:
The weekend had arrived,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.852
but it was business as usual
for my sister.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.187
Hi! Just doing
my nightly RA check-ins.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.522
Any big plans tonight?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.691
Oh, yeah. Huge.
Don't wait up.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.793
I get it, you'll trust me
when you're ready.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.129
In the meantime,
read this.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.531
"Depression: More Than
A Case Of The Mondays"?

09:24.598 --> 09:28.401
Mm-hmm. It happens
to a lot of lonely,
isolated shut-ins, like you.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.970
I'm not depressed, Srini.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.471
Of course not.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.607
"Denial,
De Thing Dat You Have."

09:33.674 --> 09:35.375
Dear Lord,
who writes this crap?

09:35.442 --> 09:37.878
Such anger.
Luckily, I have the perfect
pamphlet for that.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.013
Okay, seriously, do you have
a pamphlet for everything?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.449
Big-time.
He gave me the one
for divorced parents

09:42.515 --> 09:44.752
and something else
that's totally cleared up now.

09:44.818 --> 09:48.756
Look, I am not depressed
or angry or in denial.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.791
I'm just in
a long-distance relationship.

09:50.858 --> 09:54.494
Oh! Of course.
All the signs were there.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.263
You're a textbook BORF!

09:56.329 --> 09:58.866
For sure.
Total BORF.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.734
Okay,
what the hell is a BORF?

10:00.801 --> 10:04.537
It stands for "Boyfriend-
Obsessed Reject Freshman."
That's you.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.839
I am not a BORF!

10:05.906 --> 10:07.340
It's not a bad thing,
Erica.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.409
You're just that sad girl
that stays on the phone

10:09.476 --> 10:11.845
with her loser boyfriend
from high school
'cause she has no life.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.180
That sounds very bad!

10:13.246 --> 10:15.115
I don't want to be a BORF!
What do I do?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.884
Come with me
to the Delta Nu party.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.852
It's gonna be bonkers.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.654
Yes! Bonkers!
I am there!

10:20.721 --> 10:22.122
I'm just gonna
call Geoff...

10:22.189 --> 10:25.358
Mmm.
...is something that a BORF
would say.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.727
I need help.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.261
I'll get you a pamphlet.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.130
Crimp?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.599
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it's game time.

10:32.666 --> 10:36.336
Today's scooter ball captains,
Goldberg versus Goldfarb.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.739
Uh, Coach?
We went through this already.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.808
Do I really have to get my mom
involved again?

10:40.874 --> 10:42.876
It's happening,
Goldfarb.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.113
Now, get on that tiny scooter,
like a man.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.949
ADULT ADAM: But that day,
Coach would have to man up

10:49.016 --> 10:50.617
and face his older brother.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.119
Yo! Coach Rick!

10:52.185 --> 10:54.955
Coach Nick.
We need to powwow.
Take a knee.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.757
This is my gym.
You take a knee.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.525
Can't,
I said "Take a knee" first,

10:58.591 --> 11:01.962
so, according
to the laws of coaching,
you got to take it.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.364
BEVERLY: Boys,
watch Mellor and Mellor

11:04.431 --> 11:06.599
sort through decades of anger,
all thanks to me.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.401
It's true.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.370
Blondie came by work
the other day
and told me you were sad,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.239
and so I figured
I'd just come by here

11:12.305 --> 11:14.708
and tell you personally
I'm sorry...

11:15.608 --> 11:16.877
that you lost your (BLEEP).

11:16.944 --> 11:18.545
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.581
Are you that gutless
that you got to get
some hot mom

11:21.648 --> 11:23.016
to come by
and whine for you?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.517
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.254
I've been waiting to say this
my entire life.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.990
You are a mean
and rude person!

11:30.057 --> 11:31.424
Excuse me?
You're just jealous

11:31.491 --> 11:33.493
'cause I'm a real coach
and you're stuck here.

11:33.560 --> 11:37.164
That's not my fault,
but you act like it is,
and that is hurtful.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.233
All right, that's it!
You're outta here!

11:40.300 --> 11:42.202
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

11:42.269 --> 11:44.304
Did you just
blow your whistle at me?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.705
Yeah, I did!

11:45.773 --> 11:47.174
And according
to the laws of coaching,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.342
that means
you got to take a lap!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.444
No. You take the lap!

11:52.813 --> 11:54.114
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

11:54.181 --> 11:55.648
(ALL GASP)

11:55.715 --> 11:57.751
How dare you blow
your whistle at me in
my gymnatorium?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.519
You have no right!
But I do.

11:59.586 --> 12:03.123
This is the Blare-X 2000,
the Champagne of whistles,

12:03.190 --> 12:05.759
given only
to college coaches.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.928
So...my whistle wins.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.429
Anybody can get
a whistle.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.164
What really matters is
what's in here,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.266
and you and I both know
I always give 110%.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.569
And everyone knows
I give 111.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.938
That's not possible!

12:18.005 --> 12:20.307
Everybody knows
that 110% is the maximum!

12:20.373 --> 12:22.442
Boys, think of
your poor sweet mother.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.578
You're family. You have to
settle this the right way.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.114
With sports.
With sports.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.784
I was thinking
kind words and maybe
huggies and snuggies.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.386
Never! We settle this
on the court, like men.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.522
Scooter ball?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.358
Shouldn't you choose a game
you don't suck at?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.626
Let's go.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.128
Two-on-two.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.264
Big brothers
versus little bros.

12:44.331 --> 12:48.001
Winner takes the title
of best brother
in the universe.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.370
No! My babies want
no part of this.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.706
Yes! I'm on
the scary giant's team now.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.608
Barry Goldberg.
Try to keep up.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.211
ADULT ADAM: While I was forced
into a brotherly death match,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.613
my dad was dead set
on keeping Erica

13:00.680 --> 13:02.215
occupied on the phone.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.018
Why don't you come on down
and get comfy cozy in my chair

13:05.085 --> 13:06.519
and call Erica.
Really?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.856
'Cause you said if I came
within 5 feet of your chair

13:08.922 --> 13:10.090
that you'd punch
my father.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.358
(CHUCKLES HEARTILY)

13:11.424 --> 13:13.626
That's me,
the funny dad havin' fun.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.830
Here's the phone.
I'm gonna get you
a cup of joe

13:16.897 --> 13:18.798
so you can talk to Erica
all night long.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.500
Actually,
she's at a frat party.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.935
What? Why?

13:22.002 --> 13:24.304
Her 32-year-old sophomore RA
called her a BORF,

13:24.371 --> 13:27.040
so she's gonna
experience college a bit.
Does this recline?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.775
Get out of my chair!

13:28.842 --> 13:33.080
You're okay with
Erica cavorting around
Washington, D.C.,

13:33.146 --> 13:34.982
with a bunch
of drunken frat boys?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.549
Yeah, it's fine. I trust her.
No!

13:36.616 --> 13:38.385
You have to make sure
that she's safe

13:38.451 --> 13:40.487
and she's committed to you
and only you.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.123
Now get out of here!

13:43.190 --> 13:46.193
And that's how you keep
your daughter a lonely shut-in

13:46.259 --> 13:47.861
for another
glorious evening.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.997
Or you sent
a desperate high-school boy

13:50.063 --> 13:53.400
to Erica's college
to commit to her forever.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.169
Come on.
He knew what I meant.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.872
He had no idea
what I meant.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.607
That boy's
got to be stopped.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.742
(ENGINE STARTS)

14:02.809 --> 14:05.812
If my parents ask, I'm staying
with Barry for the weekend.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.514
Thank you
for believing in love!

14:07.580 --> 14:10.117
No, no, no!
That's the opposite
of what I believe in!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.619
Where are you going?
I got to drive like hell,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.354
beat that moron
to Erica's door!

14:14.421 --> 14:17.090
You need pants!
I'll get 'em on the way!

14:17.157 --> 14:19.092
ADULT ADAM:
With that, my dad scooted off

14:19.159 --> 14:21.461
to stop Geoff
from making a huge mistake.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.664
Meanwhile, the gym was packed
for the great
scooter-ball showdown.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.567
Didn't think there'd be
such a big crowd
for scooter ball.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.969
You kidding?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.304
Some even think
we're playing to the death.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.906
To the death?
What?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.707
Relax.
It's just a rumor.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.876
But you might want to give him
one last squeeze.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.445
This has gone too far.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.847
Mama is putting a stop
to this right now.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.784
Don't back down now!
You can do this
on your own, Goldberg.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.353
You called me
by my actual last name.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.421
Yeah, because
you finally earned it.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.290
Unless you want to go back
to your mother

14:50.357 --> 14:52.059
solving all your problems
and end up just like me.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.827
Oh, God!
That's the last thing
I want.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.997
No offense.
Some taken.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.265
But he's right, Mom.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.500
I got to stop hiding
behind you.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.303
I have to unleash the beast
inside of me.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.406
No, Schmoo.
You know you can't eat dairy.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.840
Not that beast!

15:07.907 --> 15:09.676
I'm talking about Barry.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.213
It's time he stops looking
at me like I'm some
lazy-eyed nerd.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.148
ADULT ADAM: It really was.
Thanks to Coach,

15:15.215 --> 15:18.118
I finally realized
what I had to do...fight.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.253
For every Rec Spec-sporting
little brother

15:20.320 --> 15:23.256
who suffered a lifetime
of living in the shadows.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.992
Game on!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

15:25.058 --> 15:26.859
ADULT ADAM: I was gonna
stand up to Barry,

15:26.926 --> 15:30.998
by taking a seat
and scooting like
I never scooted before.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.966
You're going down,
Mellor!

15:33.033 --> 15:35.635
Not if I take you down
first, Mellor!

15:36.636 --> 15:38.605
(SNEAKERS SQUEAKING)

15:41.774 --> 15:43.676
Go long, baby!
Go long!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.178
I got you!
Look alive!

15:45.245 --> 15:46.846
Take the shot,
Goldberg!

15:46.913 --> 15:49.382
(DISTORTED)
Take the shot!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.051
ADULT ADAM: And that day...

15:51.118 --> 15:55.555
(DISTORTED)
Not in my house!

15:55.622 --> 15:58.291
...I gave Barry
a gym-class smackdown

15:58.358 --> 15:59.826
for the first time ever.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.261
And it was glorious!

16:01.328 --> 16:03.796
Foul! That was a foul!
It doesn't count!

16:03.863 --> 16:06.166
You're cheating
like you always do, cheater!

16:06.233 --> 16:08.135
Oh, please!
You got no integrity at all!

16:08.201 --> 16:09.736
And you're a butthead.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.005
Why don't you roll over here
and call me that to my face.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.174
Here I come, tough guy.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.608
Let's see what you got.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.410
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

16:18.678 --> 16:20.013
(BOTH GRUNTING, GROANING)

16:20.080 --> 16:22.282
Is this what you want
when I'm gone?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.317
(GRUNTING, GROANING CONTINUE)

16:26.886 --> 16:29.156
ADULT ADAM: Thanks to my dad's
poorly worded advice,

16:29.222 --> 16:31.724
Geoff was ready
to go big or go home.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.160
Geoff?
Erica!

16:33.226 --> 16:34.461
I can't believe
you're here!

16:34.527 --> 16:35.895
I know.
I had to see you.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.264
And why is
your dad here?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.698
Schwartz.
Ugh. I know.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.900
Some last-minute
furniture-convention thing?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.302
Yeah. I said that.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.603
You're going to the Ramada
with me.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.638
Uh, no.
He'll be staying with me.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.408
Without adult supervision?
What do you think this is?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.077
College.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.113
I hear dorm drama.
I have a pamphlet
for defusing confrontations.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.082
Oh, my.
What's all this?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.817
Lameness. Just Erica
totally BORFin' out.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.719
Nobody is
BORFing anyone.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.655
Your dad's right.
It wouldn't be appropriate
for me to stay.

17:02.722 --> 17:03.856
Unless...

17:03.923 --> 17:05.058
Oh, boy.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.060
We were married?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.328
Is that a ring?

17:08.395 --> 17:09.596
I sold
my CD collection.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.231
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's happening, dude?

17:11.298 --> 17:12.599
It appears
your boyfriend is proposing

17:12.665 --> 17:14.467
with a tiny,
little diamond flake.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.269
It's a definitely "No"
in my opinion.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.604
Do you two mind?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.339
Come on, Erica.
What do you say?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.007
Let's throw away our futures
and keep this love train

17:21.074 --> 17:22.742
chuggin' on down
to marriage town.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.876
So poetic.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.245
Get out! Get out!

17:25.312 --> 17:27.280
And you! What the hell
has gotten into you?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.415
Mostly your dad.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.982
So, is this happening, or?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.184
Absolutely not!

17:31.251 --> 17:32.352
Oh, thank God.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.920
I'm sorry,
Mr. Goldberg.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.222
She said "No,"
and I'm super pumped
about that.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.956
Wait. Did you
put him up to this?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.391
Well,
not exactly like that.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.093
Although I could
get used to the idea

17:40.160 --> 17:41.561
of a long-distance
marriage.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.196
Is that why you don't care
about the phone bills?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.698
Are you trying to keep me
from having fun at college?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.300
Hey, can I stand up now?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.569
Who tries to ruin college
for their daughter?
Who does that?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.604
Hey, he's the one
who screwed it up
by proposing.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.640
I just wanted him to keep you
from having a life.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.708
And I want you both
out of my life.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.845
Don't be mad!
I was just trying to do
what everyone tells me to,

17:58.911 --> 18:00.079
like a good boy!

18:00.147 --> 18:02.048
I didn't want
to make you unhappy.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.816
I just wanted you
to be lonely.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.818
Okay, his thing is
much worse than mine.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.787
I love...
(DOOR SLAMS)

18:07.854 --> 18:09.956
ADULT ADAM: Yep, sometimes,
it's hard to let go,

18:10.022 --> 18:12.992
and even harder
to admit when you're wrong.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.462
Mind if I grab
a hippo?

18:15.528 --> 18:18.298
(SIGHS) Sorry about gym class.
It's just...

18:18.365 --> 18:19.732
I've picked on you
my whole life,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.534
and it's hard to let go,
you know?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.002
Well,
it wasn't all bad.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.904
I mean, you brought out
the beast in me,

18:24.971 --> 18:28.175
and I scored my first goal
in anything ever.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.109
That's all 'cause of you.

18:30.177 --> 18:33.546
After seeing Coach and Coach
fight like little children,
I realized,

18:33.613 --> 18:35.682
I don't want that to be us
when we get old.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.749
It won't be.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.884
How can you be so sure?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.952
'Cause even though
you give me dead arms

18:40.019 --> 18:41.388
and call me a nerd

18:41.454 --> 18:44.357
and flush the toilet
when I'm in the shower,

18:44.424 --> 18:46.393
you really are
my best friend.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.030
Same here, nerd.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.766
ADULT ADAM: Just like that,
my mom's worst nightmare
went away.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.902
'Cause that's
what brothers do.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
Yo, Coach Rick.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.939
ADULT ADAM:
They look out for each other.
No matter how old they get.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.908
Coach Nick.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.310
Come back to gloat?

19:03.376 --> 19:06.179
No. We're the ones
who dragged him back here.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.014
He's got something
he needs to say.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.949
Look...

19:10.016 --> 19:12.452
I had a hard time
as a kid.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.521
I was huge and shy
and had a goatee,

19:14.587 --> 19:16.723
so everybody thought
I was a narc.
I remember.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.560
I felt bad about myself, and
I took it out on you. And...

19:21.594 --> 19:22.829
I'm sorry.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.531
Don't be.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.366
I think you're right,
I'm jealous.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.968
You're a real coach
and I'm here.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.738
Hey, you turn these
little punks into men.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.407
If that ain't great coaching,
I don't know what is.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.643
ADULT ADAM: That day,
one set of brothers...

19:36.709 --> 19:38.745
Get that thing out of here
and bring it in.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.681
ADULT ADAM:
...helped another see things
a little differently.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.816
Well,
that could've gone better.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.354
Yeah, sorry I couldn't go
through with marrying your
daughter, Mr. G.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.257
Again, not what I wanted.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.724
But you're a nice boy,

19:51.791 --> 19:54.661
and you really do
love Erica, so...

19:54.727 --> 19:55.995
(GRUMBLES)

19:56.062 --> 19:57.930
Maybe someday.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.832
Oh, man. That means
you actually like me?

19:59.899 --> 20:02.535
Just get in your tiny
French clown car.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.136
He likes me!
Shut up.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.839
Hey, idiot!
Don't go!

20:06.906 --> 20:09.242
Um, are you talking
to him or me?

20:09.309 --> 20:12.078
She's talking to you,
Schwartz.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.680
Just don't stay out
too late.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.715
Wait. You're okay
leaving us alone?

20:15.782 --> 20:16.883
Yeah, I trust you.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.385
No, you don't.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.621
Look, it used to be my job
to keep you safe.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.691
But I guess I just
have to realize...

20:25.725 --> 20:28.661
that's not my job
anymore.

20:28.728 --> 20:33.099
I can't believe my little
peanut is all grown up.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.469
ADULT ADAM: Best team
you'll ever be part of is
your family.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.606
You take a lot of
shots in life, and sure,
you miss a few,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.975
but you're always stronger
together.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.477
'Cause in the end,

20:44.544 --> 20:46.846
the best teams aren't always
the ones who win.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.249
They're the ones who play
with their heart.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.728
(BELL DINGS)

21:04.230 --> 21:06.265
No more.
No more!

21:06.333 --> 21:07.667
I'm serious.
No more!

21:12.071 --> 21:13.506
That one's for Mama.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.007
Your ball, Goldbergs.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.309
We're done.
You win.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.410

21:17.477 --> 21:18.445
