00:20.158 --> 00:21.425
[Dick] <i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.458 --> 00:24.361
-Ellis?
-Hey, you okay?

00:24.394 --> 00:27.240
-We gotta go!
-No! We have to help him!

00:29.100 --> 00:30.667
[Faddei] You're to come home
at once

00:30.701 --> 00:32.036
and take your royal turn.

00:32.069 --> 00:33.137
Wear the crown.

00:33.170 --> 00:37.841
[rumbling]

00:37.875 --> 00:40.344
-Don't--
-Sorry.

00:40.378 --> 00:43.613
More will come for you,
legions of them.

00:43.646 --> 00:45.146
Let them come.

00:49.786 --> 00:51.055
[laughs]

00:51.088 --> 00:54.125
[Eve] You're going to need
a few days of sleep to recover.

00:54.158 --> 00:56.357
You rest.

00:58.563 --> 01:01.265
[Dick] Your father killed
for a living

01:01.298 --> 01:03.167
using the name Deathstroke.

01:03.201 --> 01:06.650
We want you to join us.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.909
[Dick] Jason, wait.

01:12.942 --> 01:16.692
Can I tell you something?

01:25.656 --> 01:29.859
I lied.

01:29.861 --> 01:30.861
I lied to you guys

01:30.861 --> 01:33.096
because I was afraid
you'd leave this place.

01:33.129 --> 01:34.965
And me.

01:34.965 --> 01:39.965
And if that happened,
there would be no Titans.

01:40.070 --> 01:44.242
And I lied to you, too.

01:44.275 --> 01:45.742
I told you that Jericho
was dead

01:45.775 --> 01:48.045
when I got to the church,

01:48.078 --> 01:49.680
but he wasn't.

01:49.712 --> 01:52.784
He was alive.

01:52.816 --> 01:57.816
He died trying to save me
from his father.

01:59.722 --> 02:03.093
I'm sorry.

02:03.126 --> 02:06.427
You all deserved more.

02:24.181 --> 02:25.348
Lying sack of shit!

02:25.383 --> 02:29.854
[Dawn] Hey.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.923
How many other fucking
half-truths have you told us?

02:32.956 --> 02:37.461
At least you got a half-truth.

02:37.495 --> 02:40.495
My brother's dead
because of you.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.537
I'm out.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.840
-I'm going with her.
-Jason, you--

02:48.840 --> 02:51.207
Look, you don't decide
what I do anymore.

02:51.241 --> 02:53.942
What anybody does.

02:57.881 --> 03:00.883
I'm out, too.

03:00.918 --> 03:04.068
I'm going with Donna.

03:06.257 --> 03:11.061
Can I go with you?

03:11.094 --> 03:12.128
Sure.

03:12.163 --> 03:14.614
[Gar] Rachel?

03:16.467 --> 03:19.167
I can't stay here.

03:26.243 --> 03:27.593
Let's go.

03:34.551 --> 03:37.320
Kind of messed up, Dick.

03:37.354 --> 03:40.655
[cell phone vibrating]

03:44.395 --> 03:46.645
[keys clacking]

03:54.271 --> 03:55.272
[Kory sighs]

03:55.306 --> 03:58.776
You're leaving now?

03:58.810 --> 04:03.810
I got a loose end
to take care of. Sorry.

04:04.382 --> 04:06.750
At least it's out now.

04:06.783 --> 04:09.353
The truth.

04:09.387 --> 04:14.387
I'm sure they'll
get over it soon.

04:26.769 --> 04:27.819
[sighs]

05:10.814 --> 05:14.084
Kory?

05:14.117 --> 05:15.168
Really?

05:38.043 --> 05:41.345
[Kory] Looks like getting out
of my ship was painful.

05:41.379 --> 05:44.314
Getting out was
the least of it.

05:44.348 --> 05:45.550
What happened?

05:45.583 --> 05:47.184
Your sister happened.

05:47.218 --> 05:49.252
Blackfire's here?

05:49.286 --> 05:50.487
No.

05:50.521 --> 05:54.992
But she sent her friends
to kill the both of us.

05:55.026 --> 05:57.461
Your extended field trip
has had consequences.

05:57.495 --> 05:59.295
What does that mean?

05:59.329 --> 06:01.932
Blackfire now wears the crown.

06:01.964 --> 06:03.834
Your crown.

06:03.867 --> 06:06.637
[chuckles] That's impossible.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.607
She would have had
to circumvent my entire court.

06:09.639 --> 06:11.875
They're all dead, my queen.

06:11.910 --> 06:14.211
Just like she wanted
you and me.

06:14.245 --> 06:18.745
She sent the royal goon squad.

06:21.084 --> 06:23.687
Fucking bitch.

06:23.721 --> 06:25.156
Queen fucking bitch.

06:25.189 --> 06:27.990
She's gonna take it apart,
piece by piece,

06:28.024 --> 06:30.194
everything we built.

06:30.226 --> 06:31.963
It's begun.

06:31.995 --> 06:35.033
Anyone who gets
in her way will die.

06:35.065 --> 06:37.634
The best thing
for you to do is just run,

06:37.668 --> 06:41.105
stay out of reach.

06:41.137 --> 06:42.706
Take me to my ship.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.742
You know those movies
where shit gets all burned up

06:44.742 --> 06:47.444
in a giant cone of fire?

06:47.478 --> 06:48.680
Your ship's gone.

06:48.713 --> 06:50.048
What about yours?

06:50.081 --> 06:55.081
It'll take some work,
but it's not impossible.

06:58.357 --> 07:01.526
[scoffs] So, what, we're just
like his little soldiers

07:01.559 --> 07:03.961
that work on
a need-to-know basis?

07:03.961 --> 07:06.730
I mean, he got a kid killed.
Who the fuck hides that?

07:06.730 --> 07:08.764
You were there, too.

07:08.764 --> 07:09.800
What?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.636
You played your part.

07:11.668 --> 07:13.038
You all played a part,

07:13.071 --> 07:17.341
and you all decided
to kept it a secret.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.644
We thought it was for the best.

07:19.677 --> 07:24.214
Yeah. Yeah, I know you did.

07:24.247 --> 07:25.682
Oh, my God. These tech losers

07:25.716 --> 07:28.485
are making this city
a nightmare.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.420
Yeah.

07:30.454 --> 07:33.524
Hey, go right on Montgomery.

07:33.557 --> 07:36.408
[car horns honking]

07:43.634 --> 07:46.803
Rachel?

07:46.838 --> 07:48.639
[grunts]
Rachel, what's happening?

07:48.673 --> 07:51.872
[Rachel] Sorry, Donna.

08:00.317 --> 08:02.954
This doesn't make any sense.

08:02.987 --> 08:05.857
[stuttering] Look, I get
why everyone else is leaving.

08:05.889 --> 08:10.560
They're pissed. Okay. Fine.
But they left.

08:10.595 --> 08:13.497
Logically, that means
you don't have to.

08:13.531 --> 08:15.298
I fucked up, Gar.

08:15.331 --> 08:18.836
Yeah, okay, and you admitted it

08:18.870 --> 08:19.870
and apologized for it.

08:19.903 --> 08:22.740
[stuttering]
What more can you do?

08:22.740 --> 08:25.889
[sighs] Nothing here.

08:28.745 --> 08:33.417
Okay, so what am
I supposed to do?

08:33.451 --> 08:34.451
Hold down the fort.

08:34.451 --> 08:35.552
The place pretty much
runs itself.

08:35.552 --> 08:36.754
If you got any questions,

08:36.788 --> 08:38.389
there's a manual
in the tech room.

08:38.422 --> 08:40.725
Yeah, hi.
Hey, I got a question.

08:40.758 --> 08:42.927
What about the unconscious,
naked dude down the hall?

08:42.961 --> 08:44.928
He's your number one job.

08:44.928 --> 08:46.029
His vitals are steady.

08:46.029 --> 08:47.398
Just check on him
every few hours,

08:47.398 --> 08:48.499
but nothing to worry about.

08:48.532 --> 08:50.768
He's probably
gonna outlive us all.

08:50.802 --> 08:53.202
When he wakes up, call Bruce.

08:53.236 --> 08:54.605
Bruce Wayne?

08:54.639 --> 08:56.539
No, Bruce Springsteen.

08:56.573 --> 08:58.375
Oh.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.410
Conner will probably want
to get in touch with Superman.

09:00.410 --> 09:02.245
Bruce can make that happen.

09:02.245 --> 09:03.114
[chuckles sheepishly]

09:03.114 --> 09:05.448
So he and, uh,
Superman are like...

09:05.482 --> 09:08.451
Just call him, okay?

09:08.451 --> 09:10.187
He's your number one job.

09:10.187 --> 09:11.121
Number one job.

09:11.121 --> 09:14.325
-All you gotta do.
-It's all I gotta do.

09:14.357 --> 09:15.408
Thanks.

09:22.399 --> 09:24.349
I'll be back.

Keep the faith, Gar.

10:11.514 --> 10:12.884

10:12.884 --> 10:15.019
and no one to do it but me.

10:15.019 --> 10:18.019

but a journey
of a thousand miles

30:15.086 --> 30:16.086
I think you should go.

30:16.119 --> 30:18.823
[Slade] No, no.

30:18.855 --> 30:20.124
Wait!

30:20.157 --> 30:22.425
He's tired. It's time to go.

30:22.459 --> 30:23.894
Grayson!

30:23.928 --> 30:28.632
[grunts]

30:28.665 --> 30:31.701
You came here to pay your debt,

30:31.736 --> 30:35.906
but there's
no forgiveness here.

30:35.940 --> 30:37.974
Our war is over.

30:38.009 --> 30:41.811
But if you ever put
the Titans back together,

30:41.846 --> 30:45.182
even for a weekend...

30:45.215 --> 30:50.215
I will kill
every last one of you.

30:57.295 --> 31:00.597
[Gar] So think of all of this,

31:00.631 --> 31:03.067
San Francisco, like one big,

31:03.101 --> 31:05.236
totally immersive,
three-dimensional,

31:05.269 --> 31:07.904
interactive,
multi-player video game.

31:07.939 --> 31:10.942
-And you're Player One.
-Okay.

31:10.974 --> 31:12.210
And your job is to make sure

31:12.242 --> 31:15.279
that everyone stays safe
and no one gets hurt.

31:15.313 --> 31:16.713
Is that what the Titans do?

31:16.747 --> 31:18.715
Well, we don't,

31:18.749 --> 31:20.050
but the old Titans did.

31:20.084 --> 31:22.486
Dick mostly just kept us
locked up in the Tower.

31:22.486 --> 31:23.320
[chuckles]

31:23.320 --> 31:25.390
Jason, Rachel
and I talked about

31:25.423 --> 31:27.857
how we wanted
more real-life experience.

31:27.892 --> 31:30.527
And once the team
is back together again,

31:30.560 --> 31:31.895
I think we'll get it.

31:31.929 --> 31:33.196
I know this sounds crazy,

31:33.230 --> 31:34.932
but once the team
knows you're awake

31:34.965 --> 31:37.067
and can see what you can do,

31:37.101 --> 31:38.368
they'll be back in a hurry.

31:38.403 --> 31:41.571
So, Gar... what can you do?

31:41.605 --> 31:42.772
[laughs sheepishly]

31:42.807 --> 31:44.174
[stutters] It's no big deal.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.809
Come on. Can you show me?

31:45.843 --> 31:49.046
Now's not the best time.

31:49.079 --> 31:51.015
Well, can you tell me?

31:51.048 --> 31:52.950
Yeah, yeah.

31:52.983 --> 31:54.251
It's kind of weird,

31:54.285 --> 31:58.122
but I can turn into a tiger.

31:58.155 --> 32:00.991
[laughing] No way!

32:01.025 --> 32:04.627
Yeah.

32:04.662 --> 32:06.912
What's a tiger?

32:11.634 --> 32:13.037
[clears throat]

32:13.069 --> 32:16.472
[exhales and growls]

32:16.507 --> 32:17.674
[roars]

32:17.708 --> 32:20.510
-Whoa.
-[barks]

32:20.544 --> 32:22.313
That's awesome.

32:22.346 --> 32:25.950
Look, there's more to it,
but I'll show you later.

32:25.982 --> 32:28.385
[man screaming] Help!

32:28.419 --> 32:31.622
Help! They're hurting me! Help!

32:31.654 --> 32:34.991
Game on. Hero time.

32:35.026 --> 32:37.961
[grunting]

32:37.994 --> 32:39.644
Conner, no!

32:43.867 --> 32:45.769
[grunts]

32:45.803 --> 32:50.208
[crowd clamoring]

32:50.240 --> 32:54.744
[sirens wailing]

32:54.778 --> 32:56.079
[tires screech]

32:56.113 --> 32:58.015
Get down, now!

32:58.048 --> 33:01.518
This is your last warning.
Stand down.

33:01.551 --> 33:03.801
[all screaming]

33:07.357 --> 33:09.326
[soldier] Down on your knees!

33:09.358 --> 33:10.558
Shut up!

33:17.000 --> 33:18.935
[cop grunts]

33:18.970 --> 33:20.904
[barking]

33:20.938 --> 33:23.039
[screams]

33:23.074 --> 33:27.077
[sirens wailing in distance]

33:27.111 --> 33:29.810
[tires screeching]

33:32.317 --> 33:34.511
[man speaking indistinctly
over police radio]

33:47.765 --> 33:50.914
[sirens stop wailing]

34:07.218 --> 34:10.855
You didn't eat
your corn nuts either.

34:10.887 --> 34:12.822
I lost my appetite.

34:12.856 --> 34:14.657
Do you mind?

34:21.097 --> 34:23.432
Your sister, Blackfire...

34:23.467 --> 34:25.202
Yeah?

34:25.235 --> 34:26.936
[Faddei] I know you're angry,

34:26.971 --> 34:30.940
and I'm angry, too, but...

34:30.974 --> 34:33.043
I know you still love her.

34:33.077 --> 34:35.813
You don't know her like I do.

34:35.846 --> 34:39.250
She's always been a climber.

34:39.282 --> 34:41.452
She's always been kind to me.

34:41.485 --> 34:43.686
She wanted
to have you castrated

34:43.721 --> 34:45.056
after we slept together.

34:45.088 --> 34:46.690
Rules are rules.

34:46.724 --> 34:50.126
You haven't always been
so nice either.

34:50.161 --> 34:53.463
That... that toast you gave

34:53.498 --> 34:55.798
at your cousin's wedding?

34:55.833 --> 34:57.434
About her hair?

34:57.467 --> 35:00.771
Huh?

35:00.804 --> 35:03.474
I have been hard on her.

35:03.507 --> 35:05.342
She was always in my shadow.

35:05.376 --> 35:09.045
Too frail to play
the Glass Games.

35:09.045 --> 35:11.315
To weak to run
the Two Moons race.

35:11.349 --> 35:13.317
I think she ran
the Two Moons once.

35:13.351 --> 35:15.085
We shortened
the course for her.

35:15.119 --> 35:17.121
She never knew.

35:17.155 --> 35:20.291
If it wasn't for me,
she wouldn't even
have any friends.

35:20.324 --> 35:21.358
What about Lexi?

35:21.391 --> 35:23.193
Lexi was her speech therapist.

35:23.226 --> 35:25.663
The point is,
you helped each other

35:25.697 --> 35:28.632
through rough
situations before.

35:28.666 --> 35:33.469
Maybe there's some way
you two can do it again.

35:33.503 --> 35:35.672
Mmm-hmm.

35:35.706 --> 35:38.376
Co-queens?

35:38.409 --> 35:42.313
Make peace with my sister...

35:42.346 --> 35:46.083
or go back and start
a revolution.

35:46.117 --> 35:48.052
It's a tough call.

35:48.052 --> 35:52.056
Well, I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

35:52.088 --> 35:55.793
Hmm.

35:55.793 --> 35:58.793
Well, I'm a fighter.

36:17.414 --> 36:20.117
[exhales deeply]

36:20.150 --> 36:23.086
Where are we going?

36:23.119 --> 36:27.291
Nowhere.

36:27.324 --> 36:29.159
Bad sleep?

36:29.193 --> 36:30.543
No sleep.

36:37.467 --> 36:40.438
[inhales] Do you want
to talk about it?

36:40.471 --> 36:45.108
I didn't want
to come back here.

36:45.141 --> 36:48.512
Anywhere but here.

36:48.545 --> 36:51.648
I wanted to pick up
where we left off.

36:51.682 --> 36:54.885
Before Dr. Light and Ellis.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.422
It was working before then,
we were moving forward.

36:57.454 --> 36:58.789
Yeah, until we weren't.

36:58.822 --> 37:01.458
You wanna pick someplace else,
get a map and some darts.

37:01.492 --> 37:03.059
I'll go anywhere you want.

37:03.094 --> 37:04.094
It won't matter.

37:04.128 --> 37:05.195
What won't matter?

37:05.228 --> 37:08.065
[Hank] Trying someplace new.

37:08.099 --> 37:10.034
The problem isn't where we go.

37:10.067 --> 37:11.869
It's us.

37:11.902 --> 37:14.304
You've been listening
to Ellis' sister.

37:14.338 --> 37:16.340
[Hank] She's right.

37:16.373 --> 37:20.210
All we do is bring pain
with us, wherever we go.

37:20.244 --> 37:21.679
[scoffs]

37:21.713 --> 37:26.713
For Christ's sake, we met
in grief counseling, Dawn.

37:27.485 --> 37:30.454
We're practically defined
by loss.

37:30.487 --> 37:32.255
I don't believe that.

37:32.289 --> 37:34.257
I don't think you do either.

37:34.291 --> 37:37.427
When we're together...

37:37.461 --> 37:38.896
we beat the shit out of people

37:38.896 --> 37:42.166
and pretend it's for
the greater good of humanity.

37:42.166 --> 37:44.235
When in reality,

37:44.268 --> 37:45.469
all we're really doing

37:45.503 --> 37:48.371
is keeping the cycle
of pain alive.

37:48.405 --> 37:50.574
That's what we are to you?

37:50.574 --> 37:55.574
Some sort of twisted,
fucked-up pain response?

37:56.146 --> 38:00.918
Maybe we should be apart.

38:00.951 --> 38:03.420
What?

38:03.454 --> 38:06.123
See if the world is a little
less fucked up a place

38:06.157 --> 38:09.456
without Hank and Dawn.

38:13.197 --> 38:16.496
If you want to go, go.

38:21.472 --> 38:24.322
[car engine starts]

39:03.547 --> 39:05.347
[Kory] Well?

39:18.295 --> 39:20.331
It's too bad.

39:20.364 --> 39:22.166
I've seen worse.

39:22.199 --> 39:27.199
That you couldn't find it
in your heart to forgive.

39:27.739 --> 39:30.541
Let's end this game, Blackfire.

39:30.574 --> 39:32.077
When did you know?

39:32.110 --> 39:37.110
Faddei wasn't at the wedding
when I joked about your hair.

39:37.347 --> 39:41.052
Faddei, if you can hear me...

39:41.085 --> 39:46.085
if there's any part of you
that's still alive in there...

39:47.023 --> 39:50.661
I am so sorry.

39:50.695 --> 39:55.695
[Faddei breathing heavily]
Please hurry.

39:59.103 --> 40:01.202
[gasps] Do it.

40:04.942 --> 40:06.141
[chants]

40:17.989 --> 40:20.891
He was stronger
than I expected.

40:20.925 --> 40:23.494
What do you want, Blackfire?

40:23.527 --> 40:25.963
[Blackfire]
We could rule together.

40:25.996 --> 40:28.666
It's always been
a dream of mine.

40:28.699 --> 40:30.735
Have you asked
Mother and Father?

40:30.768 --> 40:32.302
[Blackfire] Of course not.

40:32.335 --> 40:34.873
[laughing]

40:34.905 --> 40:37.876
They were always yours,
weren't they?

40:37.876 --> 40:39.277
There was never a day
that went by

40:39.277 --> 40:43.380
that I didn't think about
how much happier they'd be...

40:43.414 --> 40:45.382
if I was gone.

40:45.416 --> 40:46.784
You killed them.

40:46.818 --> 40:49.721
[Blackfire]
I have my own family now.

40:49.753 --> 40:52.121
One that loves me.

40:52.121 --> 40:55.425
Just me.

40:55.458 --> 40:58.829
I'm coming for you.

40:58.862 --> 41:02.500
Good.

41:02.532 --> 41:03.532
Bye.

41:14.143 --> 41:15.143
Fuck.

41:26.456 --> 41:30.956
[people chatting indistinctly]

41:35.766 --> 41:37.201
[ticket agent] Reservation?

41:37.233 --> 41:39.871
Uh, no, not yet.

41:39.903 --> 41:42.873
Where are we going today?

41:42.907 --> 41:46.777
-Sir?
-I don't know. Um...

41:46.811 --> 41:49.179
Far, far away from people.

41:49.213 --> 41:51.648
[chuckles] You'll have
to narrow that down.

41:51.681 --> 41:53.317
The most remote place you go.

41:53.349 --> 41:56.887
Um, Japan, France...

41:56.887 --> 41:58.800
[ticket agent] Not a lot
of people in Greenland.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.724
[keyboard clacking]

42:00.757 --> 42:03.393
Uh, it'll take a day,
but I can get you there.

42:03.427 --> 42:05.463
Sounds good. I'll go there.

42:05.463 --> 42:06.630
[ticket agent] Uh, just you?

42:06.630 --> 42:08.197
Just me. One way.

42:08.231 --> 42:09.599
[keyboard clacking]

42:09.634 --> 42:14.634
-Any bags to check?
-[Dick] No bags.

42:15.873 --> 42:19.623
Passport and credit card.

42:23.981 --> 42:28.931
[man speaking indistinctly
on TV]

42:34.692 --> 42:37.561
What can I do you with?

42:37.594 --> 42:40.130
Uh, Diet Coke.

42:40.164 --> 42:41.164
Ice.

43:03.588 --> 43:08.588
So where's a guy got to go
to get some real shit
around these parts?

43:09.393 --> 43:11.530
[female newscaster]
<i>...earlier today
of what witnesses say</i>

43:11.530 --> 43:15.199

[woman over PA] This is
your final boarding call

43:37.121 --> 43:39.791
for Flight 805 to Greenland.

43:39.791 --> 43:44.327
Final boarding call.

43:44.360 --> 43:48.532
Dick, uh...

43:48.565 --> 43:51.034
[stutters] I'm sorry.

43:51.068 --> 43:56.068
Something really bad happened
and it's my fault.

43:57.340 --> 44:00.610
I need your help, so...

44:00.644 --> 44:03.494
call me back, yeah?

44:19.597 --> 44:21.231
Excuse me, sir.

-[cop 4] On the ground, now!

[cops continue yelling]

44:36.746 --> 44:39.284
