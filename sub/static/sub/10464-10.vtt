WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.651
Is this weird or is this weird?

00:08.675 --> 00:10.893
This is definitely weird.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.770
What do we do with that?

00:13.012 --> 00:14.198
Eat it, I guess.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.366
We can't eat it.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.701
Cake is for celebration.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.662
Hi. I've got a buffet dinner
for 50 and no one to eat it.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.663
I was wondering...

00:20.687 --> 00:21.872
In case you didn't notice,

00:21.896 --> 00:23.624
we don't have anything
to celebrate.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.669
Yeah, well, it's too bizarre to
give to a soup kitchen, too,

00:26.693 --> 00:28.911
so either we eat it,
or we let it rot.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.464
Hey.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.247
Hey.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.043
I said hey, Claud.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.547
Charlie, what do you do with
the presents? Keep 'em?

00:40.206 --> 00:42.226
Or return them to the stores?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.936
Shouldn't you return them
to the person they're from?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.803
I don't know, okay?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.307
I've never been through this.
I don't know how to act.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.602
All I know is that I gotta
get out of here for a while.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.562
<i>Meaning what?</i>

00:54.971 --> 00:58.409
Meaning I gotta figure out what
the hell I'm doing with my life.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.952
I can't do it here.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.070
So I'm gonna take off
for a little while.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.781
I'm gonna go to Mexico.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.252
Wait. You're going, anyway?
Even though...

01:08.276 --> 01:09.879
Tickets are non-refundable.
So is the room.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.881
I don't know Charlie, a
honeymoon without a wedding...

01:11.905 --> 01:14.800
What am I supposed to do? I can't
afford a whole other trip and I mean it

01:14.824 --> 01:18.127
If I don't get away from these
chairs and flowers and this cake

01:18.286 --> 01:20.380
and that damn bed...

01:21.873 --> 01:23.800
So I'm going.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.982
You think if I took Claud
with me, she might...

01:30.006 --> 01:32.183
You know, start to forgive me?

01:33.593 --> 01:34.852
Maybe.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.687
Yeah, maybe.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.315
Cool.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.454
Never in a million years.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.238
Not a chance.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.786
Okay. So no allergies.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.872
No history of heart disease
or high blood pressure.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.532
Not currently taking
any medications.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.160
And... are you sexually active?

02:32.318 --> 02:34.454
No.

02:35.572 --> 02:39.009
Well, I mean, I was once.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.637
But I won't be again, probably.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.681
At least not for a
really long time.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.685
So, technically, yes, but for
all practical purposes, no.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.260
So what brings you here?

02:49.586 --> 02:54.066
Well, I just figured, I mean,
I've never been to a, um...

02:54.090 --> 02:55.308
A gynecologist?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.360
Right.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.362
And I just figured
that since I...

02:58.386 --> 03:00.990
had done that, that I should.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.867
And that makes
sense, doesn't it?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.994
Any sexually active
16-year-old woman...

03:05.018 --> 03:06.078
No, see...

03:06.102 --> 03:08.122
should start having regular paps

03:08.146 --> 03:10.698
and should decide on a reliable
form of birth control.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.117
No, I really don't need that.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.839
I mean, he used
a-- We were safe.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.048
There's the pill.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.300
I hate pills.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.303
Then we're looking at
the diaphragm, the IUD,

03:22.327 --> 03:24.337
or the cervical cap.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.728
So we stay for what, like,
an hour, hour and a half,

03:30.752 --> 03:31.729
and then we can leave, right?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.147
What? No.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.524
No, no. This is a very
important party to Gram.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.817
Yeah, but with Charlie gone,

03:36.841 --> 03:38.559
we'll have the house
practically to ourselves.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.280
So? Gram's anniversary
only comes once a year.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.323
I'm not just gonna cut out.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.574
Yeah, I'm sorry,

03:43.598 --> 03:46.327
but with your grandfather
technically no longer living...

03:46.351 --> 03:49.038
I explained this.
Two, four, six...

03:49.062 --> 03:50.664
You have to admit
it's kind of weird.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.124
How long has he been dead?

03:52.148 --> 03:53.292
Fifteen years.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.251
You made me lose count.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.628
Fifteen years?

03:55.652 --> 03:58.329
That doesn't strike
you as a little...

03:58.446 --> 03:59.840
Okay, so it's a little unusual,

03:59.864 --> 04:02.041
but it does not mean that
we're not gonna stay.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.223
Hi. Mom, have a seat.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.590
Don't put me by
those damn windows.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.134
I get so damn scared
I'm gonna fall.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.812
Hi.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.105
Hi, honey.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.523
Gram, this is my
boyfriend Bailey.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.516
Hi. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.351
Did you say Bailey?

04:20.843 --> 04:23.239
Are you one of those
Newport Baileys?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.897
No, Gram, Bailey's
his first name.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.734
What the hell kind of
first name is Bailey?

04:28.851 --> 04:31.153
What the hell kind of
first name is Gram?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.085
We're setting the
table for the party.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.461
Good for you.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.088
No silverware for Grandpa.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.997
No, of course not.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.499
Of course not.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.960
Needs a plate and a chair, but not silver.
Of course not.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.216
They've got snorkeling
at this place.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.803
You're on my seat belt.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.598
Sorry.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.986
The doctor said that
all we have to do

05:02.010 --> 05:03.362
is put a bag over your cast.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.438
You can swim all you want.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.857
Excuse me.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.410
Where did you get those?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.736
From here. The pocket here.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.487
Thanks.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.698
They've also got
music every night.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.660
Not classical, probably,
but mariachi.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.289
I'm sorry. What
station are you on?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.217
Five. Comedy.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.176
Great.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.428
There are markets too.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.212
We can get you one of
those Mexican dresses.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.645
What do you think of guys

05:36.669 --> 05:38.596
who call off a wedding an
hour before the ceremony?

05:38.629 --> 05:40.264
What do I think?

05:40.339 --> 05:43.360
Well, assuming the bride was...

05:43.384 --> 05:44.403
Perfect.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.657
Yeah. Well, that's
pretty unforgivable.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.442
That's what I think too.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.082
Is anybody at your house?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.124
The sitter.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.741
No one.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.828
She really knew Kennedy?

06:44.403 --> 06:47.132
Man, I've never really known
people who knew people before.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.426
Well, don't be intimidated. She
really likes you, I can tell.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.419
She'll probably make you
read to her tomorrow.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.305
Wait, tomorrow?

06:53.329 --> 06:55.631
I thought we were gonna
go to my place tomorrow.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.601
I don't know, Bailey.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.894
I kind of told my
mom I'd be around.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.011
- I think maybe...
- You think what?

07:01.045 --> 07:02.731
That you don't wanna
spend time with me?

07:02.755 --> 07:04.807
- No, it's not that.
- Then what?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.277
'Cause tomorrow is
a perfect chance

07:07.301 --> 07:09.770
for us to spend time
together completely alone.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.658
How come you're more excited

07:12.682 --> 07:14.201
about spending a day
with your family

07:14.225 --> 07:15.202
than a day with me?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.995
I don't know, Bailey.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.497
Maybe I like being around them.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.706
I mean, I can count on them.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.949
And you can't count on me,
is that what you're saying?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.002
No. No, look.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.796
You can't blame me for being
a little cautious here.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.589
That is not fair. I apologized.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.632
I know.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.510
It's just silly little things,
stupid little things,

07:31.534 --> 07:34.295
like trust and total
devotion, take time.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.297
Okay? Understand?

07:36.914 --> 07:38.799
Yeah. I understand.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.346
I hate it, but I understand.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.334
Nice, don't you think?

08:04.358 --> 08:06.128
Whatever.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.296
Yes?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.497
Salinger. I have a reservation.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.384
You're not gonna cut me one
inch of slack here, are you?

08:12.408 --> 08:14.094
No. Because I'm mad.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.096
You can make me come here,

08:16.120 --> 08:17.806
but you can't make
me forgive you.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.465
And you can't make me have fun.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.690
Do you see it? Do you see it?

08:26.714 --> 08:27.774
See what?

08:27.798 --> 08:28.984
A flying something.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.611
I hate bugs.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.529
I'm fine with
snakes and rodents,

08:32.553 --> 08:34.405
but when it comes to bugs,

08:34.429 --> 08:36.440
I'm... I'm...

08:37.850 --> 08:40.568
I'm Courtney. Hi.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.082
I'm sorry. I'm Charlie.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.001
Here you go, Mr. Salinger.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.701
The honeymoon suite.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.797
You're Charlie Salinger,

08:50.821 --> 08:52.382
and you're on your
honeymoon, so I'm...

08:52.406 --> 08:53.467
No, I'm not.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.417
I'm with my sister.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.346
Right. Okay.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.463
No, really. She's 12.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.476
And she kind of
hates me right now,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.134
so basically I'm here alone.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.179
Well, how do you
feel about bugs?

09:07.296 --> 09:09.399
Bugs...

09:09.423 --> 09:10.817
Bring 'em on.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.393
So...

09:12.635 --> 09:15.896
what you're saying is if I
found a bug in my room,

09:16.055 --> 09:20.244
room 454, I could ring you, and
you'd come kill it for me?

09:20.268 --> 09:22.027
That'd be...

09:22.311 --> 09:24.530
Yeah, fine.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.826
Three-twelve. It's good to know.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.815
So, I hate to state the obvious,

09:49.839 --> 09:52.067
but in case you didn't notice,

09:52.091 --> 09:53.944
I thought I'd point out
that we did it again.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.812
No. I noticed. I
definitely noticed.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.825
So I guess we learned that all
that stuff we said before...

09:59.849 --> 10:01.952
About not being able to do
it without being in love?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.277
A hundred percent bull puckey.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.205
Because we did it.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.915
We did the big nasty.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.375
"Big nasty."

10:08.399 --> 10:10.085
How about "nooky"? Can
we say we nookied?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.870
Sure, if you prefer,
or we boffed.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.506
We mated.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.800
We made whoopee.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.417
We made love...

10:19.118 --> 10:20.794
Or not.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.131
Not, I think.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.270
Because we're still
not going out, right?

10:28.294 --> 10:29.396
Right.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.023
We're just...

10:31.047 --> 10:32.316
Sleeping together.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.984
Yeah.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.737
People do that. They
have sex and not go out.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.071
The French do it all the time.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.823
Yeah. So it's sophisticated.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.815
Yeah. Cosmopolitan even.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.910
So does that work for you?

10:43.934 --> 10:46.153
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

10:46.437 --> 10:47.780
Okay.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.500
It says here the instructors
are there all day.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.127
Just tell them we wanna
learn to wind surf.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.588
I don't wanna learn. You do.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.633
No. I just wanna do
something fun together.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.676
The dining room's this way.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.178
Claudia, you've gotta eat.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.387
Hey.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.388
Hey.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.057
Go with the fruit salad.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.141
Hi.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.591
Hi.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.645
It's not as good as in Fiji,

11:09.669 --> 11:12.304
but it's definitely better
than in the States.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.358
When were you in Fiji?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.934
After Tahiti, before Ecuador.

11:20.304 --> 11:23.200
I'm traveling around the world
until my money runs out.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.277
I'll probably end up stranded
in Mykonos or something.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.206
I've always wanted
to go to Mykonos.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.583
Yeah? What's stopping you?

11:31.607 --> 11:34.326
Oh, you know, obligations.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.089
Well, nobody's gonna
give you the time.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.664
You've just gotta take it.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.209
Never thought of it that way.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.628
That's probably not allowed.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.598
He must be sleeping.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.933
Who?

11:58.050 --> 12:00.352
I don't know yet, but
someone very important.

12:00.761 --> 12:01.947
Staying there?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.365
How do you know?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.399
My father tells me.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.077
Who's your father?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.528
Juan Carlos Sabato Luis Sanchez.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.331
This is his hotel.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.949
The best hotel in all
of Cabo San Lucas.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.576
It's okay.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.048
Please, miss, tell me...

12:20.072 --> 12:22.926
why are you wearing
these clothes on beach?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.835
The pant and the sweating?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.013
Because I don't like the sun.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.890
Then is good you come to Mexico.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.384
I didn't wanna come.
My brother made me.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.763
He's a bad man, this brother.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.557
Making you come to
a beautiful beach.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.194
It's very sad. I start to cry.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.155
Look, I'm not a beach person.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.114
Okay.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.949
So you no liking the beach.
This is what I do.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.692
I make you my partner in
spying on important guest.

12:48.726 --> 12:52.038
Maybe is prince falling in love
with you, making you princess.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.530
You have a big adventure, yes?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.877
You're weird.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.621
Yes, but is you who is
wearing sweating on beach.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.214
Here they are.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.642
Wow. He wrote you a lot.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.896
Your grandfather never took
a trip without writing me.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.648
Oh, he knew what he was doing.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.600
And enunciate, please.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.145
"My darling Sarah... "

13:26.555 --> 13:28.116
You're a Sarah too?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.359
She's my namesake. Go on.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.663
"Cold snap in New York...

13:33.687 --> 13:35.290
Got there just in time
to hear the good news.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.958
They've gotten a baby.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.710
Marie's ecstatic.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.203
Dylan's as proud as
if she were his own.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.456
- The name... "
- What was that?

13:44.907 --> 13:47.292
Here, Bailey, here's another.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.461
- Read another one.
- No. No, Gram...

13:49.662 --> 13:52.766
Honey, this one's from Korea.
That was such an exciting time.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.975
Gram, let me see that.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.592
Sarah...

13:55.960 --> 13:58.136
give it back.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.140
"They're naming her after the
loveliest girl on the planet.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.769
Yes. Another Sarah to
light up the world.

14:06.595 --> 14:07.855
Lucky world."

14:10.474 --> 14:12.568
"As if she were his own"?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.991
Gram, what does it mean?

14:25.447 --> 14:26.999
I'm working!

14:30.619 --> 14:32.889
I thought you were my dad.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.049
No. He was just pulling
out when I got here.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.303
Gee, I wonder where he's going.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.307
So, anyways, guess what.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.476
You know my hair thing?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.478
That thing that was in my hair?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.564
Well, I can't find it. I
thought maybe you had it.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.193
Okay, new rule.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.830
As of right now,

14:56.854 --> 14:59.907
if either of us comes to see the
other under false pretenses,

15:00.149 --> 15:03.160
the excuse better be at least
a teeny bit plausible.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.672
Oh, you mean...

15:05.696 --> 15:07.164
Hair thing?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.751
You may as well have just said,

15:11.368 --> 15:13.295
"I'm here to fool around."

15:14.955 --> 15:17.299
I'm here to fool around.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.810
What does it mean?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.739
What did he mean
when he wrote this?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.357
Sweetheart, maybe we should
discuss this in private.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.660
Yeah. Look, I should...

15:35.684 --> 15:37.444
No. I have no problem
with Bailey hearing.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.580
Sarah, I really...

15:38.604 --> 15:40.332
Just stay here!

15:40.356 --> 15:42.334
Is Dad not my father?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.544
Did you get pregnant
with someone else?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.129
Was there another
baby Sarah that died

15:46.153 --> 15:47.714
that you named me after?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.706
Am I adopted? What are
we talking about here?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.252
Yes.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.471
Yes, what?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.630
There were a lot of options.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.384
Your father and I did adopt you.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.898
Wow, I kind of said
that one as a joke.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.952
Sarah...

16:16.976 --> 16:18.443
I'm...

16:21.397 --> 16:22.540
I was adopted?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.409
Sweetheart, please, let
me explain, honey.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.381
I really shouldn't be here.
I'm gonna go.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.039
Thank you, Bailey.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.875
I'll talk to you later, okay?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.005
Sweetheart...

16:44.336 --> 16:46.731
Look, Marco's bringing
him the room service.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.682
He's ordering sushi.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.101
So he's either from
California or Japan.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.688
Maybe movie star or
big businessman.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.691
So much for me
becoming a princess.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.285
Oh, it is okay.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.903
If it is prince, now I no
letting him marry you.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.666
I thought that was the point.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.742
The point is now change.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.123
I should probably head back.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.166
Then I walking with you?

17:16.410 --> 17:19.087
Wait. Wait. Hang on.
I can't even see.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.464
Come on.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.895
Here. It's this way.

17:25.919 --> 17:29.232
You see why is reason this is
best hotel in Cabo San Lucas?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.683
People is falling in love here.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.241
Justin, have you seen my wallet?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.659
I can't seem to
find it anywhere.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.202
Dad, wait!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.871
Justin!

17:42.895 --> 17:44.279
Dad, will you, please...

17:44.688 --> 17:46.124
Okay, all right.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.201
You and I should talk about this.
Now.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.791
I'll be right back.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.429
Okay, I'm trying not to get mad.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.264
I'm trying to understand
why I shouldn't be angry.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.308
Well, I can think
of a few reasons.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.477
Is this what you're doing here? Are
you bringing girls into your room?

18:05.501 --> 18:07.270
One girl, Dad, one.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.355
Justin, look at me.
We're talking here.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.940
No, we're not talking,

18:10.964 --> 18:12.942
because you're about to
lecture me about sex.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.819
Well, I don't wanna
hear it from you.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.404
Hey, don't you start...

18:16.428 --> 18:20.116
Especially when you're screwing
around behind Mom's back!

18:20.140 --> 18:22.192
What? What...

18:23.435 --> 18:25.121
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.248
I saw you. The hard rock show?

18:27.272 --> 18:28.740
I was there.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.293
Her? No.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.088
She's a client's daughter,
for God's sakes.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.789
Stop it, okay? This
is disgusting!

18:36.240 --> 18:38.500
It's pathetic!

18:44.248 --> 18:45.632
It...

18:46.083 --> 18:48.427
was nothing. It was...

18:50.420 --> 18:52.264
It was stupid.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.859
Oh, God.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.852
Stupid thing to do.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.657
It has nothing to do
with your mother,

19:00.681 --> 19:03.076
and it has nothing to
do with our family.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.744
Nothing...

19:04.768 --> 19:07.737
because it didn't mean anything.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.866
I promise you.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.951
Okay. Okay.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.411
Absolutely... Stop.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.372
Nothing.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.221
So I've been ranking
all the pools,

19:23.245 --> 19:26.214
all the swimming
pools on this trip.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.258
Oh, yeah?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.261
So how's this one stack up?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.889
I can't decide just
by looking at it.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.057
It's a very complicated process,

19:36.341 --> 19:38.059
lots of factors.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.020
Like?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.531
Well, like...

19:41.555 --> 19:43.449
temperature and...

19:43.473 --> 19:45.317
chlorine content...

19:45.767 --> 19:48.570
and the company.

19:55.527 --> 20:00.957
So how did you end up in the
honeymoon suite, anyway?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.214
Just a little misunderstanding.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.883
With your fiancée?

20:15.547 --> 20:16.973
Yeah.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.811
Well, her loss is
my gain, isn't it?

20:39.404 --> 20:41.007
I'm glad you like it, buddy.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.425
This is dinner for
the next two weeks.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.708
Yeah.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.169
Come in!

20:48.997 --> 20:50.215
Sarah.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.841
Hey.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.969
Hey.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.471
How are you? Are you okay?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.848
Here. Come here. Sit down.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.022
What did they tell you? Did
they tell you everything?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.401
Yeah. They said they did.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.615
I was four days old.

21:17.025 --> 21:21.746
And it was some unwed mother.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.125
What do they know about her?

21:27.536 --> 21:29.129
Not much.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.474
Nothing.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.174
I don't know.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.679
Oh, I can't go back
there, Bailey.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.850
Well, you don't have to.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.695
You stay here as
long as you want.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.270
Okay?

21:48.181 --> 21:50.191
She gave me a name...

21:52.561 --> 21:55.488
and it was some other
name than Sarah.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.495
Then they changed it
when they took me.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.960
I don't even know my name.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.450
Where the hell have you been?

22:30.474 --> 22:31.534
What's it to you?

22:31.558 --> 22:34.412
What's it...? I thought you were
lying in a ditch somewhere.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.237
Look, I was out having fun.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.416
Isn't that why you dragged
me here, to have fun?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.459
Cut the crap, Claudia.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.076
You cut the crap.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.920
All right. That's it.
You're grounded.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.005
For the rest of the day,

22:44.029 --> 22:45.673
you're gonna stay
in this hotel room.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.591
Maybe that will make you

22:46.615 --> 22:48.634
start thinking about someone
other than yourself.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.803
Like that's something you
know anything about.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.472
Like you're Mr. Considerate!

22:52.496 --> 22:54.348
Mr. Dump Kirsten, and
then go smooching

22:54.372 --> 22:55.933
the first bimbo beach
bunny you meet.

22:55.957 --> 22:56.851
What?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.718
I saw you kissing that girl.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.772
Stupid-looking one.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.398
Hey, she is not stupid.
And furthermore...

23:02.422 --> 23:04.391
Oh, like I'm gonna
listen to you!

23:05.258 --> 23:06.601
Right.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.065
Dammit.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.317
How much do you give him?

23:14.893 --> 23:17.612
Obviously too much.
Look how fat he is.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.117
- Could you...?
- Sure.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.997
Thurber, no! Thurber!

23:28.782 --> 23:31.219
Well, you know what, Thurber?
Help yourself.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.044
Sarah! Wait.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.301
I just wanted to talk to her.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.013
Yeah, well, now probably
isn't the right time.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.609
Oh, Bailey.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.852
There is never a
right time, never.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.354
You should have told her,

23:52.264 --> 23:53.282
from the beginning.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.774
Isn't that what you're
supposed to do?

23:55.308 --> 23:57.662
It's not that simple, Bailey.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.831
It's not just a matter
of deciding to do it.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.364
We had decided.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.001
When she was three, her
father and I sat her down

24:04.025 --> 24:05.378
and started
explaining it to her.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.921
And you know what she did?

24:06.945 --> 24:09.622
She put her hands over her
ears, and she started humming.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.416
So we decided to wait.

24:11.449 --> 24:12.844
For what?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.846
For her to be older,

24:14.870 --> 24:18.339
for her to be able
to handle the news.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.467
I don't know,

24:21.877 --> 24:24.730
maybe for some sort of a
sign from Lord-knows-who

24:24.754 --> 24:28.933
saying, "Now. If you tell her
right now, she won't be hurt."

24:31.219 --> 24:33.646
And then on her 12th birthday,

24:34.347 --> 24:36.576
we were going over her
presents after the party,

24:36.600 --> 24:39.861
and they were such
grown-up presents.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.574
Pocketbooks and jewelry
and diaries and...

24:46.234 --> 24:48.796
I looked at this little girl
who was growing up so quickly,

24:48.820 --> 24:54.250
and I thought, "She's ours.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.295
Nobody else's."

25:14.971 --> 25:17.232
So how did things end
up with your dad?

25:18.266 --> 25:20.578
He didn't know it was you.
He didn't know who it was.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.038
Oh, no, I'm not...

25:22.062 --> 25:24.322
I mean, that's good,
but no, I just...

25:25.315 --> 25:27.501
I wanted to know
that you're okay.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.670
I am fine.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.330
'Cause that seemed upsetting.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.010
Look, my dad is a jerk.
We had an argument.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.335
What's so interesting?

25:38.245 --> 25:41.089
I don't know. I
just care, I guess.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.683
Well, I thought we
weren't gonna do that.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.601
Well, I'm not.

25:43.625 --> 25:48.596
I'm not caring-caring. I'm
just making conversation.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.736
Yeah, well, I have a big test,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.563
and I just... I can't
chat right now, okay?

25:58.306 --> 26:01.192
Oh. Okay.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.532
Well, I guess I'll just see you.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.034
Okay.

26:22.622 --> 26:26.259
I mean, maybe he didn't love Kirsten.
I don't understand.

26:27.585 --> 26:30.815
But he did. I mean,
I know he did.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.016
You should have seen the
way he looked at her,

26:33.174 --> 26:35.435
all google-eyed.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.740
So how could he just turn
around like that meant nothing

26:39.764 --> 26:41.566
and just...

26:41.933 --> 26:43.452
Just...?

26:43.476 --> 26:45.737
Make the love to
the other woman?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.158
Yeah.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.995
Hey, Claudia.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.173
Sometime,

26:56.197 --> 26:59.459
the heart do what it want
without asking the head.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.002
Hello?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.088
Oh, hi, Mrs. Reeves.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.641
Yeah, yeah she is.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.934
- No.
- But...

27:48.958 --> 27:50.978
I did. I did. I did
tell her that.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.512
But she's still kind of...

27:54.297 --> 27:55.900
Yeah, I'm afraid not.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.141
Okay, bye.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.282
Well, it's definitely weird

28:03.306 --> 28:05.233
to talk to your mom
when she's crying.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.454
You know,

28:08.478 --> 28:10.664
from what she's told me, I
can kind of understand...

28:10.688 --> 28:11.864
What?

28:14.192 --> 28:15.702
She made a mistake.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.163
And I don't know, Sarah,

28:19.739 --> 28:21.258
I don't see what
making a mistake

28:21.282 --> 28:22.551
has to do with loving someone.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.677
She loves you.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.878
- So what are you saying?
- That...

28:25.954 --> 28:30.842
I'm saying that I think maybe
the next time she calls,

28:31.126 --> 28:33.970
I think you should
try and talk to her.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.190
I think you should try
and forgive them.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.224
- They're your parents.
- They're not my parents, Bailey.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.361
That's the whole point! And if
you can't understand that...

28:40.385 --> 28:43.197
No, I do. I do understand that.
I'm just saying...

28:43.221 --> 28:45.815
I don't think I really need you
telling me what I should do.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.244
- I'm just trying to help.
- Who?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.704
Them or me? 'Cause
you're my boyfriend,

28:49.728 --> 28:50.996
and you should be on my side.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.748
Maybe it isn't a
matter of sides.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.667
Why are you arguing with me?

28:54.691 --> 28:56.325
What's wrong with agreeing?

28:56.693 --> 28:58.504
What's wrong with saying,
"You know what, Sarah,

28:58.528 --> 29:00.673
You're right, and I'll back
you up no matter what"?

29:00.697 --> 29:01.590
I just think...

29:01.614 --> 29:03.583
Well, don't, okay.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.313
Oh. Justin.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.639
I'm missing my hair thing.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.478
Bailey and Sarah are here.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.073
Well, my mom's car
has a big back seat.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.492
Oh, hey, yeah. That
sounds really romantic.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.702
And as soon as we're done,

29:29.726 --> 29:31.819
you can kick me out,
start it up and leave.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.279
What's your problem?

29:33.396 --> 29:34.989
My problem is...

29:35.190 --> 29:36.917
My problem is that
earlier today,

29:36.941 --> 29:38.085
you were way too
busy to talk to me,

29:38.109 --> 29:39.795
and now that you're in
the mood to fool around,

29:39.819 --> 29:41.630
suddenly you have all
the time in the world.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.882
Correct me if I'm wrong.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.967
- Wasn't that the deal?
- Yeah.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.385
Yeah, it was. You know what?

29:46.409 --> 29:48.345
It's a lousy deal. It
makes me feel gross.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.097
And I can't believe
you're okay with this.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.725
I can't believe you're happy
to come over just to have sex.

29:52.749 --> 29:56.219
As opposed to your motives last
night, which were so complex.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.773
If you wanted to talk last
night, I would have talked.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.525
Well, I didn't. And if...

30:01.549 --> 30:03.944
not talking is suddenly
not okay with you,

30:03.968 --> 30:05.362
that's your fault, not mine.

30:05.386 --> 30:06.864
God, Justin, of
course I wanna talk.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.365
- We're sleeping together.
- So?

30:08.389 --> 30:09.982
That doesn't have
to mean anything.

30:12.685 --> 30:16.405
Oh, wow. Like father, like son.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.923
I hate how long

30:23.947 --> 30:26.374
it takes the water to
heat up in this place.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.960
What's this?

30:29.577 --> 30:31.379
"Isla Mujeres."

30:32.872 --> 30:36.050
Check this out. It's this tiny
little island in the Gulf.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.187
Can you believe that beach?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.346
That's where I'm gonna go next.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.641
If you wait until January, I
can get a week and meet you.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.437
I was pretty set on going alone.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.901
I'm sorry.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.906
This is a fling. I mean, we
both know that, right, Charlie?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.376
Neither one of us

31:00.400 --> 31:02.743
is looking for that
long-term thing.

31:03.778 --> 31:07.123
No. Definitely not.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.637
I mean, it's no big
deal or anything.

31:11.661 --> 31:16.299
I guess I just thought
things were going so well,

31:16.583 --> 31:19.093
maybe it could be more.

31:19.168 --> 31:22.221
I'm sorry, what was it that
made you think I wanted more?

31:22.881 --> 31:24.140
Nothing. It just...

31:26.259 --> 31:29.113
In my experience, no one
starts out wanting more,

31:29.137 --> 31:31.407
but then they meet someone,

31:31.431 --> 31:33.117
and they fall in love...

31:33.141 --> 31:35.651
I'm sorry, what was it that made
you think I'd fallen in love?

31:37.645 --> 31:39.957
Look, Charlie, you're really
fun to hang out with.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.157
But...

31:42.066 --> 31:44.702
you knew from the start
what I was all about.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.375
Hey.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.420
Charlie.

31:56.497 --> 32:02.720
You might think that you're
really into this, into me, but

32:04.964 --> 32:07.391
you don't know me at all.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.228
And I don't know you.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.688
So I just kind of doubt

32:13.890 --> 32:16.692
that this means as much to
you as you might think.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.781
I don't know. I'm not
a shrink or anything.

32:23.858 --> 32:27.787
But it just seems unlikely.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.103
The floor's probably filthy.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.012
Oh damn. Hang on a second.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.565
What are you doing?

32:46.589 --> 32:48.776
I got a... Hang on. I
got a present here.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.310
You didn't have to
get me a present.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.938
This is a good one.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.486
Pick a hand.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.785
I know that you feel like

33:08.528 --> 33:10.663
you don't really know
who you are right now.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.873
And so I figured...

33:12.991 --> 33:14.426
I figured that you
might wanna know

33:14.450 --> 33:16.419
that there's a place you can go

33:16.494 --> 33:18.921
where you're the same
person you've always been.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.976
Where you're funny,
you're smart,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.177
you're a total spaz,

33:25.753 --> 33:27.138
and you're good at poker.

33:27.255 --> 33:32.810
You're, you're really beautiful.

33:34.137 --> 33:38.441
And you're you.

33:40.893 --> 33:44.447
And you're loved.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.170
It opens the back door.
Both locks.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.131
The top one kind
of sticks, so...

33:52.155 --> 33:56.042
Use it any time you want to.
Any time.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.063
I'm not gonna sit there.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.033
Okay.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.993
I'm not going to sit
there for a reason.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.527
And it's not the reason
you think it is.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.248
After you went
inside last night,

34:26.272 --> 34:29.168
I was hanging around your yard,

34:29.192 --> 34:32.087
and I started thinking

34:32.110 --> 34:33.839
about that night that you
taught me how to dance.

34:33.862 --> 34:34.922
Remember that?

34:34.947 --> 34:36.331
Yeah.

34:36.657 --> 34:39.543
I was remembering what it
was like to kiss you then.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.672
And I don't think
I told you this,

34:43.748 --> 34:45.966
but when I left your
house that night,

34:46.626 --> 34:48.052
I was...

34:48.628 --> 34:52.483
I was so dizzy that I
fell down your stairs,

34:52.507 --> 34:53.609
literally.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.643
I scraped my hand
and everything.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.605
That's how touching you
made me feel then.

35:01.182 --> 35:05.528
And sex... It's been great, but
it hasn't been like that.

35:07.105 --> 35:07.998
So I guess

35:08.022 --> 35:09.374
what I'm trying to say

35:09.398 --> 35:10.783
is that it does matter.

35:10.858 --> 35:14.286
Caring, being in love.
It matters.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.050
- So maybe...
- No.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.886
'Cause I can't shake the feeling

35:20.910 --> 35:22.096
that it's gonna happen again,

35:22.120 --> 35:24.389
that I'm gonna drop my
guard, and you're gonna...

35:24.413 --> 35:25.641
Justin, I wouldn't.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.133
It's too hard to believe you.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.978
And I don't wanna
be like my dad.

35:30.002 --> 35:31.939
I don't wanna just
screw somebody

35:31.963 --> 35:33.806
and have it not mean anything.

35:34.048 --> 35:38.445
But... I don't think

35:38.469 --> 35:41.313
I want it to mean
something with you.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.903
That's why I'm not
gonna sit there.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.829
Hey, Claud.

35:58.614 --> 36:02.168
Check it out. I scored
some more nuts.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.921
See, in my experience,

36:07.123 --> 36:09.800
when your heart's sore, the
best thing to do is eat.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.470
Like you'd know how I feel.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.182
Believe it or not, I do.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.184
No, you don't, Charlie.

36:19.510 --> 36:24.190
I might never see Enrico
again, and I miss him.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.660
Already I miss him so much.

36:26.684 --> 36:30.164
You never miss anyone. You
just leave them and move on.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.948
I mean, like Kirsten.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.419
You said you loved her,

36:35.443 --> 36:39.747
but then one day it just...
Poof, she's gone.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.334
You might never see her again.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.336
But you don't care.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.172
You've already got someone else.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.720
Man, Claudia, when did you
get so incredibly cruel?

36:55.546 --> 36:57.681
You really don't think
that I miss her?

36:58.507 --> 36:59.401
That's like saying

36:59.425 --> 37:01.519
that you think that I don't
have a heart at all.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.530
That's just such an
awful thing to say.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.907
Well, if you missed her so much,

37:04.931 --> 37:06.366
then how could you
get all wrapped up

37:06.390 --> 37:08.442
in that... Courtney lady?

37:10.728 --> 37:15.324
I don't know, okay. I...

37:17.401 --> 37:21.580
All I know is, I got to
Mexico feeling like crap.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.759
And then I met Courtney,

37:23.783 --> 37:26.511
and I wanted to be with her

37:26.535 --> 37:30.047
because suddenly being with her
was making that feeling go away.

37:31.165 --> 37:34.051
Or at least I thought
it was, anyway.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.521
I was an idiot, I guess,

37:36.545 --> 37:37.481
because it turns out

37:37.505 --> 37:40.307
you can't make feelings
go away by ignoring them.

37:40.758 --> 37:45.688
They stick around.
They come back.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.696
Not miss anyone? God!

38:02.530 --> 38:04.883
All the French stuff was
dubbed instead of subtitled,

38:04.907 --> 38:06.959
so I figured I'd get...

38:07.952 --> 38:09.295
Sarah?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.640
You were in the exact same
position when I left.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.841
Have you just been
standing there?

38:14.750 --> 38:16.302
No. I moved.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.473
I put my books on the shelf.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.778
Then I took them off.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.947
Then I put them on.
then I took them off.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.617
What's...? Is something wrong?

38:30.641 --> 38:32.109
No.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.780
No, not wrong, really.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.876
I mean, that's a good place

38:39.900 --> 38:41.044
for my books, you know.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.245
They definitely all fit there.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.414
But?

38:45.489 --> 38:47.249
But I don't know.

38:49.285 --> 38:52.379
Whenever I put them there,
it just kind of feels fake.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.841
You know, like I'm pretending
it's a home or something.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.679
I don't think this is right.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.976
'Cause this is not my home.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.158
I don't know what is.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.526
But... this isn't it.

39:15.728 --> 39:20.824
It's a home, yeah,
but it's not mine.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.661
So...

39:32.536 --> 39:34.046
I'll drive you.

39:35.706 --> 39:36.882
Okay.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.144
Decaf nonfat latte.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.564
Make it a low-fat
scone, a cranberry one.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.056
You got it.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.353
Hi.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.188
Hi.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.994
I'm surprised you're not
at the Silent Festival

39:56.018 --> 39:57.329
at the Rialto.

39:57.353 --> 40:01.208
I just came from <i>Mabel
and Fatty's Wash Day.</i>

40:01.232 --> 40:04.827
I was gonna go see <i>Fatty's
Magic Pants</i> at 9:30.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.954
I totally forgot your order.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.331
Decaf nonfat latte.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.514
Do you know how many people know
what kind of coffee I drink?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.808
One. You.

40:17.832 --> 40:18.850
Yeah, well.

40:18.874 --> 40:19.851
And how many people know

40:19.875 --> 40:21.770
about your obsession
with Fatty Arbuckle?

40:21.794 --> 40:24.680
It's not an obsession. It's
just a profound interest.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.393
Oh, what are we doing?

40:31.720 --> 40:33.355
I don't know.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.200
It's weird, isn't it?

40:35.224 --> 40:38.453
I mean, there's a lot
that's bad between us,

40:38.477 --> 40:40.455
but then there's all
this other stuff

40:40.479 --> 40:42.374
that just makes us feel
right with each other.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.908
I just can't figure out
how to make the two fit.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.587
Not by sleeping together.

40:47.611 --> 40:51.206
No. Definitely not. It
just makes it worse.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.381
<i>Fatty's Magic Pants</i> did
kind of jump out at me.

40:59.790 --> 41:04.511
Maybe I could go with you.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.641
I totally forgot. Was
that for here or to go?

41:11.385 --> 41:12.811
To go.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.650
Baby steps.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.376
Ar-eeba?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.462
No. Arriba. You
gotta roll the R's.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.379
- How?
- R-r-r-r-r-r.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.547
Errr...

41:30.571 --> 41:31.756
Just let your
tongue flap around.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.966
- Err-r-r.
- R-r-r-r-r-r-r.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.792
- I can't do it. Errrr-errr...
- Arriba!

41:35.159 --> 41:36.835
Arrrr.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.635
Hi, honey.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.763
Hi.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.185
Maybe I'll...

41:53.552 --> 41:55.479
Maybe I'll go unpack.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.022
Okay.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.289
I'm sorry. I thought
I'd be gone.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.332
No, no, no, no, no.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.907
Don't apologize.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.831
Where were you?

42:17.117 --> 42:19.670
We went... I...

42:20.246 --> 42:24.049
I took Claudia, you know, to...
To Mexico.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.357
You went? You went, anyway?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.526
She was having such a hard
time dealing with all this,

42:32.550 --> 42:34.893
and I had the tickets.

42:35.803 --> 42:39.273
I figured, you know, some
time together, just...

42:40.474 --> 42:41.868
Wow, Charlie.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.787
Don't, please. I've
hurt you so much.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.113
Please don't be hurt
about this too.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.253
This is the last box.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.171
Maybe I'll stick it in the car

42:53.195 --> 42:55.090
and come back and say
bye to the kids.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.675
- I'll take it out for you.
- No.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.009
I got it.

42:58.033 --> 43:01.086
I wasn't planning on
seeing you, anyway.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.484
I gave her these.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.113
After our first fight.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.549
Just tell her she
dropped them, okay.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.333
Okay.
