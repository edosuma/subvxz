01:15.176 --> 01:16.348
Buddy.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.381
Hey.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.194
What's with the grin, pal?

01:25.152 --> 01:29.931
Mr. Castillo said I did a good job.
He even gave me an extra dollar.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.431
Yeah?

01:31.759 --> 01:35.969
So, that's your first paycheck, pal.
You never forget that.

01:36.897 --> 01:41.602
I told him to make it in three parts.
For you, me, and Jakey.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.670
Smart.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.139
Jakey gets the extra dollar,
'cause he's the youngest.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.274
Well, that he is.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.684
Or I could get him a new violin.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.414
For six bucks? I doubt it.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.460
But I'll tell you what.

01:56.750 --> 02:01.859
You give Jakey that six bucks
and I'll throw in the fiddle for free.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.967
Jakey'll go bananas. Bananas!

02:06.594 --> 02:07.834
Yeah, he will.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.871
Here, you want to take her for a spin?

02:10.064 --> 02:11.065
Okay.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.856
Those kids that call you slow...

02:29.083 --> 02:30.084
Yeah.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.755
They should see you shoot, boy.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.691
Get that target there.

02:39.927 --> 02:43.397
Do you think if I keep shooting good,
that I could get a star, too?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.008
Sure, son.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.480
Then we could be partners?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.149
We are partners.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.117
But then I'd have
to shoot people, right?

02:56.010 --> 02:57.250
You might.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.088
I'm not sure I'd like that.

03:01.649 --> 03:05.961
Well, I don't like it, either, Buddy,
but there's a lot of bad people out there.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.534
Somebody's gotta stop 'em.
You know, if everybody said,

03:11.125 --> 03:13.002
"I'm not gonna do that job," then...

03:13.928 --> 03:15.999
Well, who would stop 'em?

03:21.135 --> 03:23.877
Man, that is some talent
you got there, kid.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.677
Jakey's also talented.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.946
You've got two talented sons.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.147
Well, Mr. Ashman says
he saw that talented brother of yours

03:33.247 --> 03:35.750
out on his property again yesterday.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.591
With a slingshot.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.922
Jakey never left the house.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.935
He was at home playing checkers with me
the whole afternoon.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.597
Buddy, why do you always
gotta protect your brother?

03:48.929 --> 03:51.273
'Cause he always lets me
win at checkers.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.545
Pop, we're gonna miss Jakey's recital.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.288
No, we got plenty of time.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.725
Jakey.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.846
They say the kitchen's closed.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.606
I can get you a coffee.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.947
I lost my daddy, too, when I was a boy.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.086
I showed up at work. Just like you.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.358
To support the family.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.198
But I couldn't get my daddy
out of my head.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.092
How did he die?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.033
Somebody shoot him?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.503
Yes.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.842
A bad man.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.446
I met that man once, too.
In the drug store.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.254
He stopped and smiled at me.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.818
I did nothing.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.553
Nothing.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.398
And that kills me to this day.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.895
You know?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.267
Sit down, boy.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.400
Listen.

07:11.899 --> 07:16.746
That man who killed your father,
he won't get away. No, son, he won't.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.079
I want you to read that out.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.249
"Miguel Santion."

07:29.349 --> 07:30.623
Yes.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.127
You know him?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.536
Take a good look.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.696
He's the one.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.603
He killed your daddy.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.177
Now, you cannot let him get away.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.010
Kill him.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.646
- I can't.
- You can't?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.088
I don't know where he lives.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.958
You don't know where he...

08:07.087 --> 08:10.660
Why, I can find him for you.
That's not a...

08:10.924 --> 08:14.201
Look, I want you to take this.
Go ahead, son.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.238
Pick it up.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.549
That's my father's.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.452
Did you earn it like your daddy?

08:32.913 --> 08:34.984
No, I don't think you did.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.991
I think you got it because he died.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.333
I think your daddy
would want you to earn it?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.560
Earn this.

08:47.895 --> 08:52.173
You earn it and I'll pin it
on you myself.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.943
You understand me?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.613
Yeah.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.847
I understand.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.056
I'm sorry for bothering you
so late, ma'am.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.958
But I need to speak to Mr. Santion...

09:51.058 --> 09:52.469
Who the fuck are you?

09:53.260 --> 09:57.003
I'm Buddy. I work at the diner.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.341
Don't move!
Don't you fucking move, retard!

10:10.510 --> 10:12.183
What are you doing with my picture,
you stupid fuck?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.755
I was just making sure it was you.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.902
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you, Mr. Hench.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.743
Call me Julius, son.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.389
- Jakey's had his supper.
- Thanks, Ignacio.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.683
Jakey, I ain't coming to school no more.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.448
I got a new job.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.552
So, I can take care of us.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.155
Tell me about the ranch.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.792
Well, it'll be just you and me,

11:31.892 --> 11:33.961
and our house on the lake.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.597
Are there horses?

11:36.063 --> 11:40.443
Are you kidding me?
What's a ranch without horses, dummy?

11:42.202 --> 11:46.912
I'll get you a white stallion,
with a red tanned saddle.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.444
All your own.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.047
- Swear?
- Swear.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.722
You just play your violin, okay?

11:57.017 --> 12:00.521
Ignacio said, if I play real good,

12:01.555 --> 12:03.432
Pop can hear it.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.183
They said they'd let me know.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.321
"Don't call us, we'll call you."

13:07.387 --> 13:09.056
I should've played Bach.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.224
But you love Paganini.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.360
I fell in love with you
when you played Paganini.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.633
Yeah, well, they didn't.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.137
Why don't you just bring it to the wedding?
I'll get you a ticket.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.378
Buddy, I can't. I'm sorry.
I told you, I just can't, okay?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.116
I will tell her, Buds. Bye.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.314
Tell her what?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.758
Buddy wants me to come home.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.491
He got us a present.
He says he can't bring it to the wedding.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.466
That's so cute.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.425
He never asks for anything.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.505
- He's your brother.
- Yeah, I know that.

13:48.762 --> 13:52.676
It's like a different planet back there,
you know?

13:53.266 --> 13:56.907
And how do you know?
You haven't been back for ages.

13:58.905 --> 13:59.940
Go.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.382
Yeah, it's been eight years.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.585
You wanna come with me?

14:08.648 --> 14:12.926
Can you please just go meet your brother
so I can finish fixing this place up?

14:15.121 --> 14:17.328
No. Not a chance.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.419
Hey.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.770
You look good.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.903
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.637
- Yeah...
- No. Really, you look good.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.013
I got a haircut.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.783
Yeah? Yeah, I can see that.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.229
That's Eric. That's Eric.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.489
He's my bestest friend.

16:29.723 --> 16:30.793
Yeah.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.471
Hey, Jakey.

16:38.765 --> 16:42.008
Like Pop had Joe, I have Eric.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.715
Welcome home, kid.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.151
Well, let's go.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.446
- Hey, Jake, will you tell me...
- What?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.854
Where'd it go?

16:55.081 --> 16:57.450
Yeah, will you tell me
how this sounds real fast?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.986
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
- Listen.

17:00.086 --> 17:04.898
Ladies and gentlemen, I won't take long.
It's the best day of my life.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.002
What is it?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.300
It's a speech, dummy.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.468
- For your wedding. It's a wedding speech.
- Of course.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.970
Of course, it's a wedding speech, yeah.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.108
- Well, is it good?
- Yeah, well, let me hear the rest of it.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.854
That's all I got so far.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.714
It's only seven seconds.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.352
What am I gonna do, Jakey?

17:32.452 --> 17:36.089
Why don't you tell 'em a story?
Like, about when we were kids?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.158
A lot of good stories
from when we were kids.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.292
Yeah, you know, I know!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.428
You know, I'll tell them
about the time that I jumped in the pool

17:41.528 --> 17:43.263
and I broke your Lincoln Log house

17:43.363 --> 17:45.298
- and you were crying like a little girl.
- Yeah!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.500
- You remember that?
- Yeah, right. Yeah, I remember that, yeah.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.569
You took those logs,
I didn't see them for weeks.

17:49.669 --> 17:53.173
- Yeah.
- You said you were gonna fix that house.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.378
Yeah, I did fix it, though, didn't I?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.616
- You did, yeah.
- Didn't I?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.184
Yeah, Buds. You did.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.884
Yeah, that's a great story, Jakey.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.827
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.932
Yeah, they'll go bananas for that one.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.797
Hey, Jakey,
how many kids you planning on having?

18:17.897 --> 18:20.200
I don't know, Buds. That's a ways off.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.902
You know, I'm gonna quit my job
and look after them kids.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.379
Yeah, sure thing, Buds.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.113
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.677
You got to do me a favor one second.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.417
- Yeah, I'll do anything.
- You got to close your eyes.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.189
- Really?
- Yeah. Close your eyes.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.018
You want a surprise, or not? Close 'em.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.722
- All right, all right, all right.
- Come on!

18:42.021 --> 18:43.557
Okay, open 'em!

18:53.867 --> 18:55.073
Buds,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.148
what is this?

19:00.273 --> 19:03.083
A promise is a promise, Jakey.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.887
Well, how do you like your wedding gift?

19:13.219 --> 19:14.459
Come on.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.360
Hey, this is my room. Right in here.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.930
And your room's over here.
Let me show it to you. Come here.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.467
Buds, where did you get
all the money for this?

19:27.567 --> 19:31.572
I've been working real hard, Jakey.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.282
Real hard.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.845
You know, my boss,
he saves my money up good.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.582
When I told him I was quitting my job
to look after your kids,

19:42.682 --> 19:44.958
you should have seen his face.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.622
He looked...

19:48.922 --> 19:50.868
You still work at the theater, right?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.963
Yeah. Yeah.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.464
Hey, you know
what the best part about that is?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.170
I get to see all the movies for free.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.568
I tell you that before?

20:01.668 --> 20:05.013
I'm sure gonna miss that. Come here.
I'm gonna put this in your room.

20:06.339 --> 20:10.549
See, Jakey, you get the best room
'cause you're the youngest.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.013
Yeah?

20:47.113 --> 20:48.820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.252
- Look at that.
- Yeah, my boss got it for me.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.888
You know, for your wedding.

20:54.721 --> 20:58.791
Yeah, you know, he told the tailor...

20:58.891 --> 21:01.872
- Your boss goes with you to the tailor, Buds?
- No, dummy, no.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.168
The tailor comes to him.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.801
Listen. You know, he told the tailor

21:08.901 --> 21:11.704
that if I wasn't the bestest-looking man
at your wedding,

21:11.804 --> 21:13.408
there'd be a lot of trouble.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.848
A lot of trouble.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.886
He was just kidding.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.416
- No, I know. I know.
- That was a joke.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.554
He seems like a really, really nice man.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.023
- Yeah.
- When do you think I can meet him?

21:30.123 --> 21:31.891
Tomorrow.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.860
Yeah, you know,
he said that after church

21:33.960 --> 21:36.563
that he's gonna take us out to dinner
at El Cortez,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.768
just like Pop used to, remember?

21:39.198 --> 21:40.643
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.242
Great.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.044
Buds, you think
I could take your car for a drive?

21:50.043 --> 21:51.920
Right now? Yeah.

21:52.879 --> 21:53.983
Here.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.225
- Just don't take long, okay? Please.
- I won't, I won't.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.354
Ignacio?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.075
Ignacio?

23:31.978 --> 23:33.616
Jakey Heckum!

23:35.982 --> 23:38.792
Jakey! Jakey Heckum!

23:41.120 --> 23:44.966
Why did you come back, Jakey?
Why did you...

23:48.094 --> 23:49.505
Go away, Jakey.

23:50.296 --> 23:53.505
What happened? What happened to you?

23:57.370 --> 23:59.543
I saved my hands, Jakey.

24:01.307 --> 24:04.186
I saved my hands so I could still play.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.517
But the music...

24:07.780 --> 24:10.317
The music's gone, Jakey.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.487
The music just stopped.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.125
The fire's the only thing I hear.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.136
And the animal is scared of fire.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.635
Who is scared of fire?

24:25.631 --> 24:28.271
Hench is scared of fire.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.480
What's going on here, Ignacio?
What happened?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.721
Two legs

24:40.112 --> 24:42.956
for two train tickets.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.129
Julius Hench

24:48.688 --> 24:49.928
gave me a choice.

24:50.389 --> 24:53.165
Two hands, or two legs.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.204
That's two for two tickets.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.071
Legs!

25:00.700 --> 25:01.770
Legs!

25:56.489 --> 25:58.469
God! Fuck!

26:09.435 --> 26:11.176
You just tried to kill me.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.114
Why?

26:16.475 --> 26:17.715
I had to.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.088
I was told.

26:21.881 --> 26:25.419
Buddy was quitting because of you.

26:26.385 --> 26:30.390
Nobody leaves Hench.
Definitely not Buddy.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.836
Hench loves the kid.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.162
You shouldn't have never have come back.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.071
But it's not too late.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.642
Give me the phone
and get away from this town.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.344
I won't say a word.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.881
- Hey...
- Give me the phone.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.051
Give it to me!

26:48.708 --> 26:51.511
Move your fucking feet
the fuck over here

26:51.611 --> 26:53.090
and give me the phone.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.154
Give it to me
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

26:58.351 --> 26:59.557
Toss it!

27:04.790 --> 27:07.964
Is he dead, or do I have
to buy him dinner?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.470
Don't.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.001
I hear you breathing.
Talk to me, son. You okay?

27:15.101 --> 27:16.978
What's going on there? Where are you at?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.071
Don't.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.241
Eric!

27:20.740 --> 27:22.275
Talk to me, Eric!

27:22.375 --> 27:25.618
I'll send someone over there!
Where are you at?

27:25.911 --> 27:26.946
Miners...

27:28.347 --> 27:31.260
Eric! Eric!

27:32.518 --> 27:33.826
You okay, son?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.324
- Shit!
- Eric!

28:02.281 --> 28:04.150
Jacob?

28:04.250 --> 28:07.231
Take a deep breath. Ready?

28:08.020 --> 28:11.357
The Philharmonic wrote!
You got the job, baby!

28:11.457 --> 28:13.993
You did it! Can you believe it?

28:14.093 --> 28:17.006
I'm so happy for you! So happy!

28:18.864 --> 28:21.071
Come home quick, okay?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.002
Buds?

28:55.935 --> 28:58.074
Vittoria called. She wants us to...

28:59.004 --> 29:01.507
They killed Eric!

29:03.275 --> 29:04.413
What?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.881
They killed him!

29:07.713 --> 29:08.748
Who?

29:09.749 --> 29:11.684
Do they know who did it?

29:11.784 --> 29:12.818
Yeah.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.056
Who?

29:15.187 --> 29:16.598
Who, Buds?

29:18.991 --> 29:20.559
A bad man.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.928
Who, Buds? Who? Who killed him?

29:23.028 --> 29:26.399
They killed my brother.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.842
They killed my partner!

29:29.268 --> 29:32.806
Buddy. Buds, it'll be okay.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.141
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.845
- Yeah.
- No.

29:38.144 --> 29:42.286
- It will, Buds.
- I'll get him. I'll get him, Jakey.

29:43.149 --> 29:46.562
Buds. Hey, Buds. Buds, listen to me.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.321
I want you to come with me.

29:49.421 --> 29:52.024
- I got a job at the Philharmonic...
- No, I can't go with you now.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.659
I can't go with you now!

29:53.759 --> 29:57.104
I gotta find that bad man
and I gotta crack his skull in!

29:58.397 --> 30:00.206
Do you understand?

30:04.069 --> 30:05.810
Buds, the cops will handle it.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.808
No, they won't. No, they won't.

30:08.908 --> 30:13.482
Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?
You think they got him?

30:14.180 --> 30:15.818
No, Jakey!

30:16.949 --> 30:18.326
I did!

30:28.561 --> 30:29.699
I did.

30:40.639 --> 30:41.947
Bud.

30:59.058 --> 31:02.164
There's a lot of bad people
out there, Jakey.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.878
And somebody's gotta stop them.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.539
Did Hench tell you that?

31:14.406 --> 31:15.646
Yeah.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.847
If Hench told you I was a bad man...

31:22.281 --> 31:23.760
Me.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.628
Would you believe him?

31:26.852 --> 31:28.287
He would never say that.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.524
- He would never say that.
- He's not a good man, okay?

31:31.624 --> 31:32.992
- He's not a good man.
- Yes, he is!

31:33.092 --> 31:34.927
- You don't understand Julius!
- You don't understand, Buds!

31:35.027 --> 31:36.700
You don't understand!

31:40.499 --> 31:43.571
When I was driving,
I backed into a fence post, okay?

31:43.702 --> 31:44.904
So, if anyone asks what we were doing,

31:45.004 --> 31:46.806
I was playing checkers
with you all night, okay?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.146
Buds?

31:55.180 --> 31:57.558
- Hey!
- Don't cry.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.728
I'm with you now. I'm with you now, son.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.434
Hey, don't cry.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.868
Hey. Let's have a sit down. Come on.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.977
Read it out.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.755
"Mario Garza."

32:31.784 --> 32:33.286
He's the one.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.326
He robbed us in our corridor.

32:40.292 --> 32:44.968
And then he hunted down and he killed Eric.
Your friend, your brother.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.366
You see, he's not one of our kind.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.707
He's a bad man.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.610
And what are we gonna do about him?

32:55.074 --> 32:56.576
You know where he lives?

32:56.976 --> 32:59.278
Yeah. He's across the border.
He's well protected.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.654
We got to get you there
and get you back.

33:02.081 --> 33:06.086
No! No, just get me to him.
I don't care about getting back.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.928
Son.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.727
God damn!

33:15.694 --> 33:17.139
That's my boy.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.374
This will be your last job.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.774
After this, you can go live
with your brother.

33:25.904 --> 33:28.282
Yeah? Okay.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.090
Where is he at?

33:35.481 --> 33:37.859
He's... Hey, Jakey?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.735
Julius wants to see you.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.965
Jakey!

33:54.633 --> 33:56.271
Jakey. Julius.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.648
I didn't think you'd be here.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.117
Yeah, I was just

34:04.176 --> 34:06.122
playing checkers with Buds.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.648
Who won that game of checkers, Buddy?

34:09.748 --> 34:10.920
I did.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.396
I always lick Jakey at checkers.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.809
Well, welcome home, kid.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.478
Thank you, Mr. Hench. Thank you.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.692
Buddy's gonna die.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.195
They're sending him across.
I have to get him out.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.027
Out?

34:53.525 --> 34:56.301
Hench's wife tried to get out.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.238
Ran off with their son.

35:00.699 --> 35:03.680
I was his music teacher.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.207
I got her train tickets.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.213
Two train tickets.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.215
What does Hench do?

35:19.685 --> 35:21.096
He burns 'em both alive.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.670
You want Buddy out?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.835
There's only one way to do it.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.004
You see that mountain?

35:39.104 --> 35:41.846
They're gonna take it down
to get the silver out.

35:42.407 --> 35:46.583
They're gonna tunnel in, they're gonna
blow it up from the inside out.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.519
That's how you get Hench.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.086
From the inside out.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.996
Just like he took down your daddy.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.030
It was an inside job, Jakey.

36:01.994 --> 36:05.942
Your father's partner, Joe,
he just looked the other way.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.870
You were performing
your first solo, Jakey.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.752
Hench was conducting
your daddy's requiem.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.095
- I'm gonna go talk to Joe.
- Okay.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.214
Thank you for coming by, Joe.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.685
See you, Julius.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.789
Mr. Hench.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.724
You took care of Buddy all these years.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.935
I'm very grateful to you for that.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.497
I want to ask you one more favor.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.802
If you'd let me,

37:15.901 --> 37:18.074
I'd like to take Eric's place.

37:21.773 --> 37:25.311
If you send Buddy across the fence,
I wanna go with him.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.452
I wanna be his partner.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.726
What about your life in New York?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.793
New York made me forget
what I promised my father.

37:37.856 --> 37:42.134
Kept me away from home,
kept me away from Buddy.

37:46.999 --> 37:50.811
You know, my brother dropped out
of school to take care of me.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.476
So I could play the violin.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.542
What did I do?

37:56.642 --> 38:00.852
Every couple of years, he'd come visit me.
I'd take him to the Central Park Zoo.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.028
And he was so grateful.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.599
All he asked in return is that

38:11.523 --> 38:14.834
I come see him,
I come and spend some time with him.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.866
But I didn't.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.074
I...

38:24.536 --> 38:26.311
I abandoned him.

38:30.008 --> 38:33.455
I'm back now and I'd like
to be a real brother.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.886
Sir, I love Buddy
and I wanna take care of him.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.356
We'll talk at the Alamo.

38:44.389 --> 38:46.369
I promised Buddy I'd buy you dinner.

39:19.591 --> 39:23.403
I like vegetarians.
It's humane. No blood.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.433
Hey!

39:27.733 --> 39:29.838
He eats fish.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.470
Okay?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.811
You tell him that you eat fish.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.745
Why don't you make him
a plate of fish, Buddy?

39:53.024 --> 39:56.301
Some cowboy shot Eric with his own gun.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.652
But it's yours now.

40:17.349 --> 40:20.125
After your audition.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.454
You got his audition set up, Franco?

40:22.554 --> 40:23.726
Yup.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.113
Hey, where's Jakey?

40:39.571 --> 40:40.914
He went on his audition.

40:43.809 --> 40:44.879
Hey.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.652
Do you think he's gonna pass that test?
Do you?

40:51.082 --> 40:52.823
He's gonna fail it.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.726
Hey, light me a cigar. Come on.

41:45.437 --> 41:46.814
Ignacio?

41:48.573 --> 41:50.246
Jakey Heckum.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.447
Now, I know why you came back, Jakey.

41:57.249 --> 41:59.855
You came back to set me free.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.464
I can't. I can't kill you.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.061
You're inside the mountain, Jakey.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.204
Take it down!

42:09.194 --> 42:10.867
Blow it up, Jakey.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.398
You put that gun to my head

42:13.498 --> 42:16.069
and you blow my fucking brains out!

42:16.535 --> 42:17.570
No.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.373
Do you think I like cursing?

42:21.473 --> 42:24.647
Pissing on God every single day, Jakey?

42:26.411 --> 42:28.755
My life is a fucking joke.

42:31.383 --> 42:32.521
This...

42:33.885 --> 42:37.765
This, Jakey, has meaning. This.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.064
- Pull the trigger, Jakey.
- No. No.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.563
- Pull the trigger! Jakey, pull it!
- No, no, no!

42:44.663 --> 42:46.267
- No!
- Please!

42:46.898 --> 42:48.633
I'll show you. I have hands, Jakey!

42:48.733 --> 42:50.268
I have hands!

42:50.368 --> 42:51.813
No!

43:24.135 --> 43:26.012
You know that night

43:28.740 --> 43:31.009
when I jumped in the pool

43:31.109 --> 43:33.453
and I broke your ranch?

43:35.614 --> 43:38.322
And you were so cross with me?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.197
And Pop talked to you?

43:47.359 --> 43:49.270
See, I wasn't sleeping.

43:52.564 --> 43:53.975
I heard him.

43:56.101 --> 43:57.444
He said,

43:59.537 --> 44:00.811
"Jakey,

44:03.108 --> 44:05.884
"you came into this world after Buddy,

44:06.711 --> 44:09.055
"but you gotta be the big brother.

44:11.249 --> 44:13.318
"And you can't hold nothing
against Buddy

44:13.418 --> 44:16.160
"'cause he doesn't understand
what he's doing."

44:19.324 --> 44:22.168
You promised him you'd take care of me.

44:27.565 --> 44:29.408
I know you're keeping your promise.

44:32.437 --> 44:33.405
I know.

44:33.505 --> 44:37.043
That's why you joined.

44:40.311 --> 44:41.756
To take care of me.

44:57.429 --> 45:00.967
Jacob, why aren't you picking up?

45:04.736 --> 45:05.976
The Philharmonic,

45:07.272 --> 45:09.274
they won't wait forever.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.779
I don't know how to get a hold of Buddy.

45:13.712 --> 45:15.749
I've called a million times.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.358
My imagination's running wild.

45:25.090 --> 45:27.502
Please, just let me know
you're all right.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.060
Just...

45:30.662 --> 45:32.266
Just call, okay?

45:35.333 --> 45:36.710
I love you.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.148
Please, just let me know
you're all right.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.814
Just call, okay?

45:48.079 --> 45:49.456
I love you.

45:56.988 --> 45:59.400
Who taught you how to play pool?

45:59.724 --> 46:01.101
All right?

46:01.226 --> 46:03.797
Watch and learn, watch and learn.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.400
Mr. Hench.

46:06.765 --> 46:08.033
- Hey, Buds.
- Hey.

46:08.133 --> 46:09.840
- Here.
- Thanks.

46:11.669 --> 46:14.206
I'm having lunch with Mario Garza.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.584
Tuesday morning at the Hotel Esperano.

46:19.110 --> 46:21.886
You're having lunch? Lunch with Garza?

46:22.313 --> 46:25.726
I used to edit an NYU journal.
A friend of mine handles it now.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.619
He writes to Garza,

46:27.719 --> 46:31.462
requests an interview with a correspondent
who just happens to be in the area.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.669
And what makes you think
he fell for that?

46:41.099 --> 46:43.375
Well, New York University,

46:44.202 --> 46:45.904
bright young students

46:46.004 --> 46:49.918
seeking his opinion on border issues,
making him feel important.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.450
It's hard to resist.

46:57.615 --> 46:58.958
Education.

47:30.682 --> 47:34.219
We got a new one going over.
I need you to lead a prayer for him, Father.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.221
I've heard a lot about you
from Father Sanchez.

47:36.321 --> 47:37.455
You heard what?

47:37.555 --> 47:40.263
That your wife was very kind
to this chapel.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.010
Jakey, shut the doors.

48:13.191 --> 48:14.397
Dear Lord.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.631
My brother worries for me very much.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.606
Please, make him understand

48:25.403 --> 48:27.815
how carefully I've thought this through.

48:28.740 --> 48:32.620
And that everything is going
to be okay in Mexico.

48:33.378 --> 48:35.619
And soon, he'll be at my wedding,

48:36.014 --> 48:39.894
in his tux, giving his speech,

48:42.220 --> 48:44.200
which I'm dying to hear.

49:57.362 --> 49:58.636
I'm sorry.

50:24.155 --> 50:28.459
So, Mr. Garza, you deny
you're the top gun-runner in Mexico?

50:28.559 --> 50:31.631
I am a thinker. Not a thug.

50:31.863 --> 50:33.308
Look around.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.470
Do you see any goons in my hotel?

50:38.002 --> 50:41.006
You consider yourself a social worker.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.077
Welcome to Esperano.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.283
I build schools.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.983
I build hospitals.

50:50.014 --> 50:51.994
I build roads.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.890
Now and then, I even build churches.

50:56.888 --> 51:00.199
Well, they say you've ordered
100 murders.

51:02.860 --> 51:05.636
I ordered an orange juice
20 minutes ago.

51:06.064 --> 51:08.738
If I had that kind of power,
you tell me,

51:09.233 --> 51:11.645
where is my juice?

51:12.703 --> 51:14.649
Pablo, my order.

51:15.339 --> 51:16.545
Find my juice.

51:16.674 --> 51:18.244
I'm dying here.

51:20.611 --> 51:22.386
Mr. Jacobs,

51:23.581 --> 51:26.585
I provide schoolbooks for poor children,

51:27.151 --> 51:30.360
medicine for those who cannot afford it.

51:30.888 --> 51:33.801
I sponsor orchestras for troubled youth.

51:34.158 --> 51:37.503
People come to me when they are in need.

51:38.062 --> 51:39.132
Why?

51:39.430 --> 51:42.604
Because the Mexican government
has let them down.

51:43.334 --> 51:46.144
So, the rumors are true.
You are running for election?

51:47.271 --> 51:48.443
You tell me.

51:48.739 --> 51:49.877
Should I?

51:54.712 --> 51:57.386
Well, if you're thinking of running,
why do you...

51:57.648 --> 51:59.984
Why do you lead a life like this?

52:00.084 --> 52:01.461
Like what?

52:01.986 --> 52:04.355
They say you sleep
in a different bed every night.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.957
Why would they say that?

52:08.526 --> 52:09.937
Why?

52:15.633 --> 52:18.239
Because when they know where I sleep,

52:18.369 --> 52:20.349
they dress like fucking tourists

52:20.738 --> 52:22.340
and come to kill me.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.680
Sir, I have no idea...

52:23.808 --> 52:27.011
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater of his.

52:27.111 --> 52:29.714
I know who you are, you little fuck!

53:09.687 --> 53:10.961
Pablo!

53:11.088 --> 53:13.329
My orange juice.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.802
You saved my life.

53:27.038 --> 53:28.540
Julius Hench,

53:29.540 --> 53:32.146
I am sending you your family pictures.

53:33.444 --> 53:37.415
Next time, I will put your fucking face

53:37.815 --> 53:39.988
on those pictures.

53:42.153 --> 53:43.461
Show him.

53:50.127 --> 53:53.301
I am sending you your family pictures.

53:53.965 --> 53:58.369
Next time, I will put your fucking face

53:58.469 --> 54:00.107
on those pictures.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.413
It was a trap.

54:08.346 --> 54:10.383
They knew we were coming.

54:15.319 --> 54:18.562
You look like shit. Get some rest.

54:20.725 --> 54:22.226
Buddy, take him.

54:22.326 --> 54:24.670
Yeah. Come on. Come on, Jakey.

54:27.031 --> 54:29.534
Are you all right? You all right?

54:30.835 --> 54:31.836
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

54:31.936 --> 54:34.071
It was a good plan.
How'd it go so wrong?

54:34.171 --> 54:36.515
Hey, Franco, are you talking
about Jakey?

54:36.941 --> 54:39.577
My brother?
You know he's my brother, right?

54:39.677 --> 54:41.145
Okay, he went across the fence.

54:41.245 --> 54:43.114
He went and I should've gone!

54:43.214 --> 54:45.183
We know that. We know.

54:45.283 --> 54:47.518
He's a good man! Okay? He's a good man!

54:47.618 --> 54:49.921
We know that he's a good man!
We know it!

54:50.021 --> 54:51.398
All right? Hey!

54:52.089 --> 54:55.195
The Lord answered our prayers, didn't he?
He's alive, right?

54:57.128 --> 54:58.573
Where is he?

54:59.597 --> 55:01.372
Where's he at? He's right there.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.501
He's right there.

55:03.601 --> 55:06.172
He's alive, son, safe and sound.

55:07.538 --> 55:11.486
Calm yourself down.
Take care of your brother.

55:13.077 --> 55:14.181
Okay.

55:14.445 --> 55:16.721
All right then, take him home.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.653
Okay.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.174
Go ahead, Franco. What were you saying?

56:19.643 --> 56:20.811
Hello?

56:20.911 --> 56:24.081
Mr. Garza? Julius Hench heard the tape.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.286
No names, you fool.

56:27.752 --> 56:30.421
Why'd you call so late?

56:30.521 --> 56:34.298
Well, I think
that Franco's getting suspicious.

56:35.025 --> 56:37.194
I just wanted to...

56:37.294 --> 56:39.433
I'll call you back tomorrow.

56:44.301 --> 56:47.339
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater...

56:54.311 --> 56:57.815
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater of his.

57:00.885 --> 57:02.455
It's McBradden.

57:09.193 --> 57:10.831
James?

57:11.562 --> 57:15.866
I thought you should know. Last night,
a call was made to Mario Garza.

57:15.966 --> 57:17.001
From where?

57:17.101 --> 57:19.775
The cell tower near you. Real close.

57:20.438 --> 57:22.816
Real fuckin' close.

57:23.908 --> 57:26.445
Do you have a name for me?

57:27.178 --> 57:31.684
No, I do not.
But Garza's gonna call him in five.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.423
That's your rat.

57:51.101 --> 57:52.136
Franco!

57:53.871 --> 57:55.976
Get everybody in the hall.

57:59.343 --> 58:01.914
Buddy, shut the doors.

58:10.087 --> 58:14.832
I want all you men
to put your guns in this bucket.

58:17.094 --> 58:18.164
Let's go!

58:25.836 --> 58:27.440
That's you, too, Buddy.

58:28.339 --> 58:29.841
Come on, son.

58:43.487 --> 58:46.024
Ace, you know what a rat looks like?

58:46.757 --> 58:48.065
Yes, sir.

58:50.361 --> 58:54.036
You think most people would know a rat
if they saw one?

58:55.599 --> 58:56.907
Yes, sir.

59:00.838 --> 59:02.715
Well, that's strange.

59:03.040 --> 59:07.411
'Cause it seems like a rat
has gone unnoticed in our theater.

59:07.511 --> 59:10.185
And this rat, he set us up.

59:12.016 --> 59:13.825
Killed our brothers.

59:16.353 --> 59:20.358
Any minute now, his phone is gonna ring.

59:23.260 --> 59:26.298
And I'm gonna know who that rat is.

59:30.267 --> 59:32.907
And then I'm gonna take these bullets,

59:33.671 --> 59:36.311
and I'm gonna put 'em
in his fucking skull.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.551
Sound fair to you, Buddy?

59:49.853 --> 59:51.025
Yeah.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.262
Yeah.

59:58.195 --> 01:00:03.042
That's so our conscience is clear,
college boy.

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:06.640
We'll just wait.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:58.126
You put your speakerphone on!

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:02.526
No, it's bullshit!

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.162
It's bullshit! It's a lie!

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:33.890
I said fuck Garza!

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.288
You understand?

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:47.532
Garza called.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:51.175
- So, he knows.
- Yeah.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.439
- He scared?
- Shit-scared.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:59.643
Every gang that's ever bought a gun from
you in Mexico is going after him tonight.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.693
That's a lot of guns.

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:10.192
He wants to meet.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.424
- When?
- Tonight at 8:00.

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:14.969
All right. Well...

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:17.027
Set it up.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.401
I have.

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:24.577
And, boss?
Garza says to leave Buddy at home.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:08.579
I thought you were dead.

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:13.989
Why didn't you answer my calls?

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:16.360
- What's going on?
- Victoria?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.628
Victoria?

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:23.769
Vittoria.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.071
Can I call you Vee?

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.376
It's so nice to meet you, Buddy.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:43.725
You speak Italian?

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.724
No. Eric taught me.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.792
You are so pretty.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:02.510
Welcome home, Vee.
I'm really glad you came.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.108
Come on in. I'll get you...

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.593
Our home

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.461
is a little messy.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.000
It's fine.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.728
Vee.

01:05:31.828 --> 01:05:36.433
Vee, I got a surprise for you. Okay?
We're gonna go take a little drive. Okay?

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:39.844
I wanna take you somewhere. Come on.
Grab my jacket. Come on.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.998
Welcome to your new home.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.404
My home?

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:14.738
I'm sorry. You know, when I built it,

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.442
I didn't know your name.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.278
I'll cut a new sign tomorrow.

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:22.516
Yeah.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.552
The thing is

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:29.386
I kind of...

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.092
I kind of don't know
how to spell your name.

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:37.134
It's a hard name to spell, Buddy.
Most people can't.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.403
Let me write it down for you.

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:09.070
Yeah, I really like you, Vee.

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:13.765
You know what? You should be the first.

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:15.066
The first?

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:17.441
Yeah, the first to ride Jakey's horse.

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:20.704
I would love to, Buddy.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.148
Do you think I could
talk to your brother for a second?

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.409
Yeah, sure.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.853
Why don't you show her inside?
Show her your room.

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:29.624
All right. Let's...

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:34.318
You know, you must be really hungry.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.787
I'll make you baked trout.
I'll make Mama's recipe.

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:38.298
Thank you.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.935
Now, tell me.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:54.307
What's the problem, Jacob?

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:59.314
My love, look at me.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:04.081
Whatever it is,
it can't be worse than my imagination.

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:07.384
I'm thinking of 10,000
terrible things right now,

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:09.088
so, just tell me.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.197
I want you to leave.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.462
I just want you to leave.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:20.303
I'm going nowhere.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:27.678
So, just tell me everything.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:35.848
I...

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.992
Yeah, baby?

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:45.924
I killed a man.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:32.813
Now, let me tell you a story about Vee.

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.279
I really like Vee.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.749
I liked her the very second
she spelled her name for me.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:44.709
And when she and my brother Jakey
leave the church as a married couple,

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:50.184
I'll go bananas.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.090
Bananas.

01:10:58.088 --> 01:10:59.965
And that's all I have to say.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.308
Hey, dinner's ready!

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.480
I'm not gonna go without Buddy.

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:20.645
He won't leave.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.952
I'll talk to Buddy.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.156
It'll all work out, I promise.

01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:30.357
There is always another way.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.635
Don't take long!

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:42.866
No! Gotta get it in the glass!

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.000
Here, gimme your glass.
Gimme your glass.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.511
I'll do you first. Good.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.575
Tell me when.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:49.612
That's it? Okay. All right. Now you.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.615
- No, no, you go.
- No, no, come on, come on.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.059
Remember Mama's china?

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.851
All this, it's so special.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.864
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:07.295
Here, gimme that.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.103
Buddy, are you coming to our wedding?

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:12.765
Yeah, of course.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.101
I got a speech almost done.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:20.375
It's five minutes, 47 seconds.

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.382
I spoke from the heart.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.011
Here.

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:32.116
We've decided to get married in Verona.
My hometown in Italy.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:35.285
It's quite far. Will you still come?

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:38.793
Yeah, of course. Sure, Vee.

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:40.666
Some trout, my love?

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.692
Yeah, yeah, please.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.998
Jakey.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.007
But it will be our secret.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.740
We just go, get married,

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.669
and it will be a big surprise
for our friends.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:56.444
Yeah. Yeah, they will be very surprised.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.308
But no telling anyone.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:00.479
Absolutely anyone, okay?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:05.158
Okay. Yeah, cross my heart.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:07.427
Okay. I cross my heart.

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:10.359
Try it.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.127
Verona. So, when do we go?

01:13:18.495 --> 01:13:21.066
We were thinking we'd go tonight.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:26.503
Mama's recipe is delicious.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:27.775
Yeah?

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.851
Well, I can't go tonight.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.918
I can't leave Julius now.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.292
I got a job to do.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:46.826
Yeah.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.331
Garza.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.500
You know that.

01:13:57.367 --> 01:13:58.937
What's a job for, Buddy?

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:01.980
What?

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:04.682
It's for the family.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.319
Hand me your wallet.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.922
Just give it to me.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.493
Remember this?

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:24.027
Jakey's share.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:28.538
From your first job.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.327
He kept it?

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:51.424
Yeah, Dubby.

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:54.160
I'm sorry, "Dubby"?

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.062
That's what you wrote.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.738
See?

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:06.740
Yeah.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:13.614
'B's and 'D's, they used to confuse me.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:17.619
I know. I mix them up all the time.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.119
Yeah?

01:15:23.253 --> 01:15:24.698
You kept it?

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:28.793
All these years?

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:32.939
Yeah, Buds.

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:36.569
Yeah?

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:43.617
Why? Why? It's just six bucks.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:47.644
It means more to him
than anything in the world.

01:15:47.744 --> 01:15:51.851
Because when you got your first paycheck,
you thought of your little brother.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:55.625
Your brother needs you
to be his best man.

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:59.330
You think this dummy will marry me
without your wedding speech?

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:16.180
Hey, Vee.

01:16:19.509 --> 01:16:20.715
Are...

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:24.051
Are there any movie theaters in Verona?

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:28.088
- Yes, Buddy.
- Yeah?

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:29.553
Seven.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.800
Seven? That's a lot.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.336
Well, I need to go get my tuxedo.

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.341
I can't leave without my tux. Okay?

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:53.814
All right, you guys eat. Okay?
Just save that for me. I'll be right back.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.311
All right?

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:05.128
I'll be right back!

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:42.191
I hear we're going to war.

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.635
Is Franco calling you from hell?

01:17:45.595 --> 01:17:47.370
Franco wasn't my man.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:50.302
Well, then, who?

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.835
What will the answer get me?

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:56.712
My word, no war. Just tell me who it is.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:59.615
He's the man who killed Eric.

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:03.256
No, that was your man.
McBradden told me that.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:07.992
My man, from your side of the fence.

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.855
Just tell me the fuckin' name!

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.792
I am sorry, Mr. Hench.
I gave him my word.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.302
I promised the young reporter

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:23.374
I would not utter his name.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.077
The fucking vegetarian!

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.722
Carry me over the threshold.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:30.508
Good boy.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.917
Where's college boy at?

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:16.722
Why, it's a secret, Julius.
It's a surprise.

01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:23.389
Well, I got a secret for you, too, Bud.

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:30.628
You see, Garza didn't kill Eric.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.370
But I know who did.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:36.600
Open that up.

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:44.612
Who is it, Julius?

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.584
Tell me.

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:52.689
I'll put a bullet in his head.

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.152
I'll kill him.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.291
And then I'll wake him up.

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:03.063
And I'll kill him again.

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:22.078
Jacob wasn't playing
checkers with you that night.

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.623
Was he, Bud?

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.090
No.

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:33.225
No.

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:41.634
No, hey. Hey, hey.
It wasn't Jake's fault. He...

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:45.305
Poor Jake, he got sick. You know?

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:48.983
Hey, hey. Light me a cigar.

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:58.254
Light me one of those up, son.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:11.636
Your first horse.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.439
Remember?

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.640
We went to Marsha's ranch.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:22.072
What color was that foal you picked?

01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:31.919
It was white.

01:22:32.782 --> 01:22:33.954
Right.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:37.762
For Jake.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:42.330
Jake never came. Never.

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:48.773
While you waited,
what did we do with that young stallion?

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:53.904
We broke him.

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.843
Yes, we broke him.

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:02.086
Sit down!

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.816
We got him a saddle.
A gorgeous one, tanned leather.

01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:10.227
- Red. Remember that?
- Yeah.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:18.069
Then what happened to that horse?

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:21.908
A fox bit him.

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.368
He got rabies.

01:23:25.101 --> 01:23:30.050
That's right, he started kicking and biting,
and that broken horse went crazy.

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:34.482
He could've killed us, son.
What did Pop tell you to do?

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:38.788
That we had to put him to sleep.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:41.255
And who had to do it?

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:43.956
Me.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:47.392
Because I loved him the most.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:52.029
Anyone else, it would've been
too goddamn painful for that horse.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:56.336
He didn't see that gun in your hand,
your finger on that trigger.

01:23:56.565 --> 01:23:59.201
All he saw was your eyes,

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:03.977
your caring, loving eyes,
putting him to sleep.

01:24:06.776 --> 01:24:10.451
The last thing that horse felt, Bud.

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:13.090
Your love.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.026
'Cause the horse wasn't bad.

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:23.302
He was just sick.

01:24:23.993 --> 01:24:25.131
Yes.

01:24:28.998 --> 01:24:31.069
That's what happened with Jake.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:37.039
The city bit him like a fox. He went mad,
he went insane. He killed Eric.

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:41.315
He made a deal with Garza to kill me.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:45.182
Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:48.054
Hey, no, it ain't his fault.

01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:51.824
You see, he got sick.

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.467
He just got sick, is all.

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:08.773
You've got to put him to sleep.

01:25:09.972 --> 01:25:11.508
At his ranch.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:15.583
You can visit him there every day.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.821
He will never leave you again.

01:25:20.683 --> 01:25:21.889
Never.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:27.528
This is your final test.

01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:32.936
You pass this test,

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:36.701
you will have earned it.

01:25:41.403 --> 01:25:42.575
Let's see it.

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:01.000
Look at you.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.764
My son.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.240
Come here.

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.174
William Heckum.

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:21.215
The brave son of a proud father

01:26:24.446 --> 01:26:26.790
who will put Jake to sleep,

01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:29.429
'cause he loves him the most.

01:26:31.921 --> 01:26:33.730
You understand, son?

01:26:36.091 --> 01:26:37.229
Yeah.

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:40.869
I understand.

01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:38.918
Pop said, "Jakey,

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:42.518
"you came into this world after Buddy.

01:28:42.618 --> 01:28:46.395
"But he doesn't understand what he's doing,
so you gotta be the big brother."

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:50.902
The next day,
Jakey let me win at checkers

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:53.073
and never beat me again.

01:28:54.263 --> 01:28:58.267
And once, you know, when kids at school
called me a slowpoke behind my back,

01:28:58.367 --> 01:28:59.937
Jakey got into a fight with them.

01:29:00.102 --> 01:29:02.139
He got beat up pretty bad.

01:29:03.238 --> 01:29:07.186
But when Mama asked him who done it,
Jakey wouldn't tell.

01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:10.679
Pop said, "You know, Jakey's right
to keep it a secret.

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:13.449
"If Buddy found out,
he'd put those boys in the hospital.

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:16.291
"Buddy'd go nuts if anybody hurt Jakey."

01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:21.901
And then he told Mama,
"My heart's at peace today.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:25.828
"'Cause I know when you
and I are no longer on this Earth,

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:28.101
"our boys are gonna
look after each other."

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:31.940
Buds?

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:15.453
Don't splash. Okay? Don't splash.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:16.712
Aren't you coming, Buds?

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:18.714
Yeah, I'm coming.
I gotta talk to Julius first.

01:30:18.814 --> 01:30:19.848
I'm not gonna go without you.

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:21.393
You gotta go, Jakey.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:22.927
You gotta take care of Vee.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:26.126
I'm coming, I promise.
I'll be there at your wedding.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:46.009
What's the grin for, Bud?

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:51.518
I saved the fish.

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:54.183
It swam away.

01:30:57.719 --> 01:30:59.255
Jacob's gone.

01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:09.299
My pop said

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.778
that I'll look after my brother.

01:31:15.204 --> 01:31:17.275
Never let anyone hurt him.

01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:25.155
Put your hands above your head.

01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:38.964
I have to go back for my brother.

01:31:44.433 --> 01:31:47.209
We'll find Jake
before the night is over.

01:31:48.704 --> 01:31:51.583
And I'll lay him to rest
right next to you.

01:31:55.878 --> 01:31:57.983
You'll be together forever.

01:32:01.617 --> 01:32:03.654
Just like my wife and son.

01:32:05.721 --> 01:32:08.327
Every Sunday I'll put flowers on you.

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:12.936
Red flowers, white flowers.

01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:16.403
It'll be perfect.

01:32:19.334 --> 01:32:23.783
But right now,
I've got to put you to sleep myself.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:27.812
Because I love you the most.

01:32:30.012 --> 01:32:31.958
You understand me, son?

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.994
Yeah, I understand.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:42.399
I am not your son.

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:45.096
You are not my pop.

01:32:45.928 --> 01:32:47.430
You are a bad man.

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:54.231
Now, let me tell you a story about Vee.

01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:56.904
I really like Vee.

01:33:58.634 --> 01:34:02.081
I liked her the very second
she spelled her name for me.

01:34:02.904 --> 01:34:05.180
I decided right there and then

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.487
that I'm gonna
be the best man in her wedding.

01:34:10.078 --> 01:34:14.356
And when she and Jakey kiss each other,
I'll clap the loudest.

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:20.088
And as she gets down the altar,

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:22.293
I'll throw flowers on her.

01:34:25.761 --> 01:34:30.301
And when she and my brother Jakey
leave the church as a married couple,

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:33.805
I'll go bananas.

01:34:39.808 --> 01:34:41.048
Bananas.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:46.826
And that's all I have to say.
