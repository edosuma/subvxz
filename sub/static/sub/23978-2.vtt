01:58.868 --> 02:01.663
That whiskey say something
to piss you off?

02:02.705 --> 02:03.748
Hit me.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.501
Third glass tonight.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.836
Put it on my tab.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.970
You drinking to remember or forget?

02:17.554 --> 02:19.556
Giving a shit won't get you a better tip.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.600
I give a shit
if you're planning to get loaded,

02:22.684 --> 02:24.727
trash my place of work.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.731
I'm planning to sit here and drink,

02:28.815 --> 02:30.817
until I come up with a better plan.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.936
Jess? It's four a.m.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
Is it?

03:08.104 --> 03:10.690
You're not back in jail again already,
are you?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.443
No.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.654
Is she there?

03:17.238 --> 03:20.950
She just got to sleep.
You know, you had her worried.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.204
Um, I can wake her if you want me to.

03:25.788 --> 03:28.082
Of course I'll wake her, but...

03:28.166 --> 03:31.336
No, it can wait.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.921
Okay. Good night.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.144
Nice ass.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.732
What did you say?

03:52.815 --> 03:56.277
I said, "Nice ass."

04:05.119 --> 04:07.455
- Harder.
- I'm so hard.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.915
Don't talk.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.502
Oh, yeah. You're a freak.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
Just had to talk.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.754
Wait. I'm so close.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.841
That makes one of us.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.552
You're...

04:21.636 --> 04:22.720
You're one of them.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.264
Get out.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.225
Freak.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.498
What do you got?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.875
I tracked down a lease on the building.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.420
It was rented to a Dr. Miklos Kozlov.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.756
So Kozlov leased the clinic. What else?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.384
I thought that was pretty good
for four a.m.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.095
Well, Trish said she found him,
but couldn't get him to talk.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.388
She left a file.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.015
Right.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.523
Got it. I'm looking for an address now.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.400
And, hey...

05:18.359 --> 05:20.153
we'll get Kozlov to talk.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.031
I'll get him. You take the day off.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.117
Thanks, but I need to work,
or I get myself into trouble.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.785
It's an addict thing.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.996
Yeah, well...

05:30.079 --> 05:31.497
This is a super-killer thing,

05:31.581 --> 05:34.250
so just text me Kozlov's address
and stay home.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.974
Maybe I am a freak.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.519
But someone made me this way.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.443
And this lab rat's got some complaints.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.332
Are you a friend of Dr. Kozlov's?

07:40.543 --> 07:43.004
- Sorry?
- A patient, then. Come in.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.839
Rina will be grateful.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.156
- I'll let Rina know you're here.
- Uh, no. That's okay. I...

08:11.741 --> 08:12.867
I don't wanna crowd her.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.039
How did he die? Kozlov, I...

08:18.122 --> 08:20.249
You know,
I just couldn't bring myself to ask.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.961
It was a car crash. Freak accident.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.257
A lot of those going around these days.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.135
The minyan will begin shortly.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.139
I am looking forward to it.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.313
It's okay to cry, you know.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.858
Any normal person would cry.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.030
Christ! At least dab at your eyes
with a tissue.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.410
The sun was up before they found us.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.498
Six guys came back wounded from my unit.
Doctor just saw free of charge.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.083
No VA, no red tape.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.420
Saved my life.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.090
He's the only person
who checked on me afterwards.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.677
- Not even the colonel.
- Doc was a goddamn patriot.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.073
Too much caffeine?

10:16.907 --> 10:18.659
Sorry. I just...

10:18.743 --> 10:21.662
I'm a little on edge.
My mother does that to me.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.414
Your mother's a riot.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.500
And by riot, I mean soul-crushing python.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.794
But she spat you out, so I gotta love her.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.214
Look at this adorable couple!

10:33.007 --> 10:35.259
- Mother.
- Hey, gorgeous.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.261
Stop!

10:38.554 --> 10:40.806
What are you all getting? My treat. Sit.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.268
I actually just came by to say hi.
And make out with your daughter.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.645
Well, that's not fair.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.397
- What about me?
- You know, I've seen that French film.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.066
And I think we're gonna
keep it A and B.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.401
You are too much.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.236
I'll see you
at the first apartment tonight.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.822
Sounds good.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.744
You can stop drooling now, Mother.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.538
I'm not drooling. I'm appreciating.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.960
So what's all this about apartments?
You two taking it to the next level?

11:10.044 --> 11:13.631
Maybe. But I didn't ask you here
to talk about that.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.840
I need a favor.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.468
I'm gonna need caffeine for that.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.554
- Can I have a coffee?
- Absolutely, ma'am.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.722
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

11:22.723 --> 11:26.560
I'm looking for a current phone number
or address for Max.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.396
Maximilian?

11:29.355 --> 11:33.150
Well, he's unlisted and I don't know
anyone who keeps up with him.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.529
But I assume you do.
For the sake of your clients.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.697
You said you never wanted
to speak to him again

11:38.781 --> 11:39.907
or even hear his name.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.785
It's for a segment I'm doing
on the radio about the hospital.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.372
Bullshit. This is about Jessie
and all the IGH business.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.416
It doesn't matter what it's for.
I just need it.

11:48.499 --> 11:52.169
Maximilian is a major donor
at Metro-General.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.880
And you want access
to confidential information.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.966
I need a lead and he can help.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.970
Careful, my darling.
Your desperation is showing.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.139
- I'm not desperate.
- Well, you should be.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.184
Your show has been riding a fad
with this powered people thing.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.268
And fads fade.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.986
I am the only one who will give
Princess Patsy the cold, hard truth.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.571
The clock is ticking.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.740
- You need Griffin to put a ring on it.
- Jesus Christ, Mother.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.742
You're gonna blow it with all this crap.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.995
Griffin supports what I'm doing.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.958
He knows
that you're reaching out to Maximilian?

12:28.539 --> 12:31.125
- He knows that I'm working on a story.
- Lie to him.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.043
Lie to yourself.
But don't lie to me, Pats.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.503
Stop calling me that.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.089
Trish is too mushy in the mouth. Trish!

12:37.173 --> 12:39.884
Look, I'm doing this
with or without your help.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.928
You know, I had hoped
that I could rely on you, but...

12:43.846 --> 12:45.097
why start now?

12:47.391 --> 12:48.601
Here you go, ma'am.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.770
You know what?
Make that a Bloody Mary. Extra strong.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.854
All right.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.066
Do you mind? Thank you.

13:05.784 --> 13:09.872
You are straying from the path,
baby girl.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.963
Turn back before you get eaten by bears.

13:18.047 --> 13:22.968
Wolves, bears, red ants, whatever.
It's a flexible metaphor.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.677
Okay!

14:06.637 --> 14:08.097
I hear you!

14:16.897 --> 14:18.190
Asshole!

14:50.472 --> 14:51.932
You a cop or something?

14:52.016 --> 14:53.976
No.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.899
You wanna party?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.279
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.131
Simpson?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.055
Hey, how you doin'?

16:13.138 --> 16:16.058
- Okay.
- Leland said you were a patient.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.686
Yeah. I just...

16:20.437 --> 16:24.900
- I can't believe he's gone, you know?
- Yeah. I do know.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.489
- Who do you work for?
- Who do you work for?

16:30.572 --> 16:33.617
My friend's dead, so I'm doing the asking.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.204
Look, I'm not gonna hit
a guy in a wheelchair.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.958
Give me that thing.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.419
Oh, for Christ's sake.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.007
- You're a...
- Kozlov experiment. Yeah.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.299
Experiment?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.552
Just like whoever caused
his freak accident.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.140
Oh, so we agree it wasn't an accident.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.810
I'm guessing one of his beasties got out
and it's pissed.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.395
It wasn't some animal.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.188
Then who?

17:04.772 --> 17:06.650
I said I wouldn't hit
a guy in a wheelchair,

17:06.733 --> 17:08.902
but you're not in a wheelchair now.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.654
Who was it?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.324
A nut-bag traitor amped up on drugs.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.998
- No way. It couldn't be.
- Simpson. Will goddamn Simpson.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.167
- He's alive?
- You know him?

17:24.251 --> 17:26.462
Yeah, he's alive.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.839
Kozlov tried to rehab him
after he lost his shit.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.651
- Yeah, I was there for that part.
- Asshole should have been grateful.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.720
Instead, he steals more drugs, disappears,
takes out the doc.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.803
And the Whizzer?

17:36.388 --> 17:37.388
You're on drugs, too?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.059
Your good friend...

17:41.185 --> 17:43.687
tortured defenseless people.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.355
No, he was a good man.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.233
He was a sicko and a sadist,
and I'm gonna prove it.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.611
Don't you dare talk
about the doctor that way.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.113
Isaiah, are you back here?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.991
Oh, my God! Isaiah, are you all right?

17:56.909 --> 18:00.037
This is a funeral, for God's sake.
What is wrong with you?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.538
What isn't?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.714
Please leave a message
after the beep.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.258
Trish. Call me, now.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.512
For the record, I am protective,
caring and concerned about this.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.889
- Register that for once.
- I'm not keeping score.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.492
Sure, you are.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.646
Jessica? Call her back.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.189
I'll call her later.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.818
What, you don't want her finding out
that we're back in touch?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.195
She doesn't wanna find out
that we're back in touch.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.115
Or she'll try
to talk you out of this Max business.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.574
Well, goodbye, Mother.

20:05.954 --> 20:06.955
Okay.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.066
What is the connection?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.024
Are we... are we supposed to knock
or just come in?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.943
I never know with doors like this.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.946
- Is it a business or a home?
- Both.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.783
Jessica Jones, right?
I've seen you before.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.744
Sorry, I don't remember you.
How can I help you?

21:27.828 --> 21:30.330
I'm Detective Sunday.
This is Detective Costa.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.749
We're here about the accident
that occurred last night.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.503
I was there. It was pretty bad.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.171
You didn't stick around
for a statement.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.135
There were other people
who saw more than I did.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.968
Victim's name was Robert Coleman.
Ever heard of him?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.220
He came to me.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.180
He wanted to hire me, but I was booked.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.266
How shitty must you feel?
Guy comes to you for help

21:49.349 --> 21:51.643
and winds up dead
around the corner from you.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.230
I had nothing to do with it. Or him.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.566
Did you know he filed a police report

21:57.649 --> 21:59.409
claiming that someone was trying
to kill him?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.654
How shitty must you feel?

22:02.738 --> 22:06.950
Evidence suggests that it was made to look
like an accident by some powered person.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.368
Not this one.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.746
Look, you assaulted someone.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.998
You're on probation.
Court-ordered anger management.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.959
- So read me my rights.
- No, we're just here to talk.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.381
Come with me.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.726
NYPD.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.816
What's going on?

22:39.900 --> 22:43.111
Hey. Do me a favor and tell them
everything you saw last night.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.781
Do you mind? Mr...

22:45.864 --> 22:49.409
Arrocho, Oscar.
I'm the building superintendent.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.703
Did you witness the incident, Mr. Arrocho?

22:52.370 --> 22:55.624
I heard it, yeah.
I mean, I got there at the tail end.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.375
I was getting ice cream with my boy.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.087
I already told the cops everything I saw.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.797
What about Miss Jones? Did you see her?

23:03.465 --> 23:04.341
Nope.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.677
- What? Bullshit!
- Ma'am, perhaps you're mistaken.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.805
You were right there.
You looked me in the eye.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.014
I didn't see anything.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.268
- I wish I could be more help.
- Sorry to have bothered you.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.355
- Asshole!
- Tell you what.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.107
Why don't you come
to the station with us?

23:20.190 --> 23:24.111
You can regale us with some super-stories.
Answer some questions, maybe.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.654
- No.
- No?

23:25.737 --> 23:29.116
I'll come down when and if this accident
becomes a real case.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.618
Until then, I've a job to do. Same as you.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.245
See you soon, Miss Jones.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.931
Hello?

23:54.724 --> 23:57.102
Malcolm, it's Trish.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.563
Hey!

24:01.356 --> 24:02.356
Hey.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.068
Uh, is this a... Is this a bad time?

24:05.735 --> 24:08.321
Uh, no, not really.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.240
What's up?

24:11.116 --> 24:14.870
I need your help... with an investigation.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.038
I, uh... I didn't know who else to call.

24:17.956 --> 24:18.957
Yeah.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.710
Uh, yeah, cool.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.296
Where are you? I'm on my way.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.632
I'll text you the address.
But one thing...

24:31.511 --> 24:32.888
Don't tell Jessica.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.807
Okay.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.923
Robert Coleman,
aka the Whizzer.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.012
Why would Simpson want you dead?

25:39.454 --> 25:40.497
Hello?

26:17.450 --> 26:18.702
Emil?

26:25.792 --> 26:29.462
Goddamn mongoose.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.528
What did they do to us?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.588
He wouldn't respond to me and...

27:12.881 --> 27:14.883
I don't know how much time I have left.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.304
Maybe you think I'm crazy, but...
but I was normal once.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.473
It was my 18th birthday. I...

27:21.556 --> 27:24.976
I got drunk and I dove off the roof
and missed the pool,

27:25.935 --> 27:29.564
then woke up in the hospital
and they changed me.

27:30.231 --> 27:34.694
I was fast before, but now I'm so fast,
I think it'll kill me.

27:34.778 --> 27:35.987
And it hurts.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.699
And... and the dreams.
I wake up screaming.

27:39.783 --> 27:44.579
And... you're always saying
how powers are good, but you were wrong.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.121
What?

27:46.706 --> 27:50.960
With great power
comes great mental illness.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.963
No, we have to tell the real story
before it's too late.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.851
NYPD.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.689
- NYPD, anyone inside?
- Give 'em hell, Emil.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.110
NYPD.

- You like?
- You got moves, baby.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.398
- You need another bump?
- Unh-unh.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.540
Do you believe in karma?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.377
You mean, like,
bad shit happening to bad people?

30:37.460 --> 30:38.461
Mm-hmm.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.588
Nah...

30:40.672 --> 30:45.510
I know too many bad people
doing just fine.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.640
I need another bump.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
Unh-unh-unh.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.321
What do you think?

31:07.198 --> 31:08.616
I don't wanna think.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.077
I don't wanna think.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.747
I don't want to.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.539
- Hey!
- Hey!

31:57.707 --> 31:59.876
Thank you for coming.
I really appreciate it.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.878
Yeah, of course. Glad to help.

32:06.716 --> 32:07.842
Put this on.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.887
- Your gym card?
- No one will check it.

32:10.970 --> 32:15.350
If anyone asks, you're a PA.
Production assistant.

32:15.433 --> 32:19.395
Just like what you do for Jessica,
except on a movie set.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.124
- You mean, getting yelled at and ignored?
- Pretty much.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.942
I got this.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.694
Uh, your phone has a video camera, right?

32:27.904 --> 32:29.364
What are we doing here, Trish?

32:31.532 --> 32:35.411
You're gonna hear some things about me
that I don't wanna talk about after today.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.623
Things you don't want Jessica to know.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.460
She knows. She's just...

32:43.211 --> 32:46.673
She's not that good at self-restraint,
especially when it comes to douchebags.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.217
And I don't want anyone to get hurt.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.178
Okay. Is this dangerous?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.181
Not physically.

32:56.683 --> 32:57.850
Reassuring.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.438
Okay.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.253
Really strict.
Really mean gangster, can you do that?

33:25.336 --> 33:26.796
Okay. Yes, I can. Mm-hmm.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.425
Max!

33:34.137 --> 33:35.304
Tricia.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.307
So happy you called.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.393
What a surprise.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.896
- Uh, we need to talk.
- We do.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.399
In private?

33:46.482 --> 33:49.235
I've got two more set-ups.
Then, I'm all yours.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.405
I'll be in your trailer.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.386
You don't even feel bad, do you?

34:15.469 --> 34:18.014
- For what?
- You lied.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.391
Do you feel bad?

34:21.350 --> 34:22.768
For bringing the cops to my door?

34:22.851 --> 34:25.313
All you had to do was tell them
what you saw.

34:25.396 --> 34:29.067
I saw a man die. So did my son.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.985
Do you know what that does to a kid?

34:33.029 --> 34:35.281
Yeah, actually, I do.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.409
I don't know what killed that guy,

34:38.493 --> 34:41.373
but I bet it had to do with whatever
shady power shit you're involved in.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.373
What did I ever do to you,
besides move your ugly fridge?

34:45.373 --> 34:48.335
Oh, I get it. You hate people like me.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.545
I threaten your masculinity or whatever.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.380
My masculinity is just fine.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.257
Uh-huh.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.763
I can't have the kind of trouble you bring
around me and my kid.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.432
- Not if I wanna keep him.
- Who is trying to take your kid?

35:01.516 --> 35:04.560
It's called a custody battle.
And I don't plan on losing,

35:04.644 --> 35:06.604
so if that puts you
in some trouble with the law,

35:06.687 --> 35:07.855
that's your problem.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.733
Look, stay the hell away from us.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.404
You stay the hell away from me.

35:27.333 --> 35:31.462
With great power comes
great mental illness.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.926
We have to tell the real story
before it's too late.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.848
Who was this guy talking to?

35:42.515 --> 35:44.308
Alien conspiracy sites,

35:44.392 --> 35:48.521
comic book fan clubs,
Friends of Mongooses International...

35:51.274 --> 35:52.400
Trish?

35:58.948 --> 36:01.117
Thank you for what you said today.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.994
For accepting us.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.539
But you need to know we're also dangerous.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.376
I can feel it inside me.
And... they put it there.

36:10.459 --> 36:13.045
I'll tell the real story on Trish Talk.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.506
Just call me.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.178
Please leave a message
after the beep.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.638
Trish, call me.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.433
You're the connection.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.476
Whizzer... Kozlov...

36:27.560 --> 36:30.229
Anybody that you've talked to
about this IGH shit is in danger.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.856
Simpson is alive.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.709
To send your message,
press pound.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.027
Mother... goddamn... shit.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.281
That's a wrap.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.332
Sorry, hon.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.543
Took a little longer than I thought.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.630
Can I get you a drink?

36:55.713 --> 36:57.423
Vodka Diet Coke, right?

36:57.506 --> 37:00.176
- I haven't had a drink in ten years.
- Really?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.678
I need something from you.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.265
You're acting again. That's fantastic.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.935
- Let me make some calls.
- I have a job.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.812
- I need access.
- To...

37:11.896 --> 37:14.899
I wanna borrow your clout
at Metro-General.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.568
- For what?
- My show.

37:17.652 --> 37:21.822
We're doing a segment on the hospital,
and I'm dealing with a lot of red tape.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.741
What's the story about?

37:24.784 --> 37:28.037
A woman missing 20 days
from her medical record.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.249
Something happened to her
during that time.

37:31.332 --> 37:35.503
Mmm, see, I donate to the hospital
to help kids with cancer. I...

37:35.586 --> 37:39.882
I mean, I can't let you just do some
hatchet job for a ratings bump.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.384
I'm not asking.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.136
You're gonna give me what I want.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.554
Or what?

37:45.638 --> 37:48.266
Or I'll go public
with what happened between us.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.102
- Uh...
- I was a child.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.146
- You were 40.
- You were 16 going on...

37:54.230 --> 37:58.025
Fifteen. And my mother pimped me out
for the lead in your crappy movie.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.988
I cast you because you wanted it
more than anyone I had ever met.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.115
And you knew I'd do anything.

38:04.198 --> 38:06.200
I was the one who was used.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.911
I didn't come here
for a twisted walk down memory lane.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.622
No, you came here to blackmail me.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.875
You know what you are?
You're a B-list radio personality

38:14.959 --> 38:18.004
who has to resort to dirty threats
to stay relevant.

38:18.087 --> 38:22.717
Says the dirty old man hiring desperate
young girls to pretend they care.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.594
You know what?
Get off of my set before I call security.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.139
You've got 48 hours
to give me what I want.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.224
Won't make any difference.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.394
You'll still be exactly
what you always fear you'd be.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.689
Utterly goddamn ordinary.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.738
Trish!

39:30.451 --> 39:32.161
I'm coming in.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.083
- Have you seen her?
- What, she's not here?

39:37.166 --> 39:41.212
- We were supposed to look at apartments.
- You're moving in? That's great.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.547
Yeah, except, uh,
she missed our first appointment,

39:43.631 --> 39:46.610
- and her phone keeps going to voicemail.
- When's the last time you saw her?

39:46.634 --> 39:49.178
This morning.
At brunch, I left her with her mother.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.430
Dorothy?

39:52.264 --> 39:55.017
- Brunch?
- Yeah, they needed mother-daughter time.

39:56.685 --> 40:00.481
- That, that look. What does that mean?
- Nothing. I just...

40:02.316 --> 40:05.653
I didn't know they were on brunch terms.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.936
They're trying to put the past behind them
or something.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.408
I'm worried that this has something to do
with her story.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.412
You been going through
her research?

40:14.495 --> 40:17.790
Yeah, I've been trying to figure out
where the hell she went. What is IGH?

40:17.873 --> 40:20.960
- What did she tell you?
- Nothing. I asked her not to.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.547
Then I encouraged her to chase the story.
Christ, I practically dared her.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.881
Now she's in trouble.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.300
- Why do you think that?
- My balls are tingling.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.052
There's medication for that.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.256
In my line of work,
you learn to trust your instincts.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.473
Griffin, why don't you go home?
She might be there.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.185
Don't manage me, okay?
I know she's in trouble.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.563
- Because of your scroty-sense?
- Goddamn right.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.023
Look, I track people for a living.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.902
You know how strong I am.
So let me get to work in finding her.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.615
- If you hear anything...
- I will call you, first thing.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.538
Goddamn hate this.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.520
What you're saying is
it's the way he's looking at her.

41:54.553 --> 41:57.139
Yes, exactly. Not that...

41:57.223 --> 42:00.017
♪ It's Patsy! It's Patsy! ♪

42:01.352 --> 42:02.728
♪ It's Patsy... ♪

42:04.063 --> 42:06.398
- Hello?
- Where's Trish?

42:06.899 --> 42:09.610
- Jessie?
- Tell me what happened today at brunch.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.070
None of your business.

42:11.153 --> 42:14.323
Tell me what you're up to,
you toxic waste of space.

42:14.406 --> 42:18.077
Living in the present, hon.
You should try it sometime.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.091
Hey!

42:32.174 --> 42:33.294
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.302
Take my wallet. Here, here's the keys.

42:36.095 --> 42:38.222
I don't want your damn car.

42:38.305 --> 42:42.226
I want you to admit
what you did to Trish Walker.

42:42.309 --> 42:44.144
Aw, listen, buddy.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.147
Whatever Trish told you,
she's the one who started it.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.857
She crawled into my bed.

42:51.318 --> 42:52.861
Shit!

42:52.945 --> 42:54.405
You broke my nose!

44:43.806 --> 44:45.224
Don't come any closer.

44:47.935 --> 44:48.935
Trish.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.035
Feels good to live in the present.

45:09.581 --> 45:12.709
You have 60 seconds to tell me
what happened today between you and Trish.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.129
- Go.
- Ask her yourself.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.673
Fifty-nine, 58...

45:17.756 --> 45:20.300
I have a right to a relationship
with my daughter.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.219
Fifty-seven, 56...

45:22.302 --> 45:24.972
If she wanted you to know,
she would've told you,

45:25.055 --> 45:26.932
but she trusted me. Not you!

45:27.015 --> 45:28.684
Eight, seven...

45:28.767 --> 45:32.229
I tried to talk her out of this
IGH business, but would she listen? No.

45:32.312 --> 45:35.357
Because she's trying to be
the hero that you'll never be.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.278
What did she want from you?

45:40.320 --> 45:42.781
Maximilian Tatum's contact information.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.786
How could you let her get anywhere
near that pervert?

45:47.870 --> 45:49.538
"Let her"? Please.

45:49.621 --> 45:51.461
But I trust him with her
more than I trust you.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.292
You've done nothing but hurt her.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.794
- Look in the mirror, lady!
- Oh, I do every goddamn day.

45:55.878 --> 45:57.045
How about you?

45:58.422 --> 45:59.840
Where is he?

46:00.841 --> 46:03.927
In Brooklyn directing a movie.
Greenpoint Stages.

46:08.056 --> 46:10.017
Hey! What about my door?

46:12.811 --> 46:15.211
I thought he was getting up
to get my money, right?

46:15.272 --> 46:17.941
But no, he gets down on all fours
and starts barking.

46:18.025 --> 46:20.527
I've gotten that before, too.

46:22.237 --> 46:25.073
I was like,
"Cool, but it'll cost you more."

46:26.658 --> 46:28.327
It's the pizza. I'll get it.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.287
Good, I'm starving.

46:30.996 --> 46:35.167
But I'm kind of over him, to be honest.
It's like that...

46:36.418 --> 46:38.962
- You are not the pizza.
- You're not Jeri.

46:39.046 --> 46:40.130
Hmm.

46:41.089 --> 46:42.549
Someone here to see you.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.680
- What are you doing here?
- I went by the office.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.892
- They told me you took the day off.
- Yet you felt compelled to interrupt it.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.228
Yeah, looks like I came in
at the tail end.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.729
What do you want?

46:55.812 --> 46:58.774
I signed the complaint against Jones.
It's ready to be filed.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.651
Great. I'll... I'll deal with it tomorrow.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.819
- Should've dealt with it today.
- I'll deal with it.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.113
Unless you fall off the rails,
if you haven't already.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.952
Something's up with you.

47:12.287 --> 47:16.416
Turn around, walk away.
You were never here.

47:18.043 --> 47:21.505
I always protect my clients, Jeri.
I hope you can say the same.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.840
Have fun.

47:25.592 --> 47:27.632
Did she tell you
what happened last night?

47:27.678 --> 47:29.638
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

47:29.721 --> 47:34.017
So my man went out drinking
last night. He gets so plastered,

47:34.101 --> 47:37.104
he comes home and he starts crying.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.356
Crying and calling me mama.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.279
I have three kids to take care of.
I don't need a fourth.

47:45.362 --> 47:46.572
My babies are my life.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.015
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

47:48.073 --> 47:51.118
Take your shit and get out. Now.

48:33.493 --> 48:35.037
Oh...

49:36.348 --> 49:37.474
Trish!

50:31.445 --> 50:32.529
Trish!

50:32.612 --> 50:34.614
Jessica, we're over here.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.912
Thank Jesus.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.167
- What is this?
- I've got this under control.

50:45.834 --> 50:46.834
Clearly.

50:47.836 --> 50:50.547
- You shot him?
- He was following me.

50:50.630 --> 50:52.007
Then you should've called me.

50:52.090 --> 50:55.719
You asked me to leave you out of it,
and I don't need to be saved!

50:55.802 --> 50:57.262
Because you're shooting people now?

50:57.345 --> 50:58.930
She's gonna get herself dead.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.932
You mean like Robert Coleman and Kozlov?

51:01.016 --> 51:03.216
- You killed Kozlov?
- No, no. That wasn't me.

51:03.268 --> 51:04.269
The Coleman kid, either.

51:04.352 --> 51:05.604
You know what? Shoot him again.

51:05.687 --> 51:07.832
- Maybe he'll start telling the truth.
- Doubt it.

51:07.856 --> 51:10.150
He barely felt the first bullet,
because he's on this.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.861
It's a performance enhancer.
Like the pills he took before.

51:12.944 --> 51:15.447
No. No, it's not like before.
I don't lose control.

51:15.530 --> 51:18.074
No, you just drop scaffolding
on people's heads.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.285
The inhaler makes me stronger,
but not that strong.

51:22.078 --> 51:26.583
I'm here to protect Trish.
And I... I need that to do it.

51:27.709 --> 51:31.254
- Protect Trish from who?
- IGH, apparently.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.799
He says they sent someone
to stop my investigation,

51:33.882 --> 51:36.259
- but he still won't give me a name!
- I don't have a name.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.783
Because you killed Kozlov!

51:37.844 --> 51:39.930
Even your old pal
in the wheelchair said so.

51:40.013 --> 51:41.014
Isaiah?

51:41.097 --> 51:44.226
He has no idea what Kozlov's involved in.

51:44.309 --> 51:46.102
- Nobody does.
- Except you.

51:46.686 --> 51:47.729
Convenient.

51:47.813 --> 51:50.398
Yeah, well, I was locked
in an old IGH clinic, so...

51:51.066 --> 51:54.611
- That's where Kozlov experimented on me.
- No, not Kozlov.

51:55.237 --> 51:56.780
It was someone else.

51:57.489 --> 51:59.241
Kozlov was arguing with him on the phone,

51:59.324 --> 52:01.368
and they said Trish's name, so I listened.

52:01.451 --> 52:05.247
He wanted whoever it was to...
make Trish go away.

52:07.624 --> 52:10.585
If I'm the issue,
then why kill Kozlov and Robert?

52:10.669 --> 52:12.379
Why am I still here?

52:14.506 --> 52:17.342
Because maybe he has been protecting you.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.389
Look, I know what I've done
and what I am.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.851
I was locked in a room for a year,
and I played all the atrocities

52:25.934 --> 52:28.979
that I'd committed
over and over in my head.

52:30.188 --> 52:31.606
This will never stop.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.652
And I look at myself
and all I see is a murderer.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.779
But for the first time, I'm grateful,

52:37.863 --> 52:39.865
because it takes a monster
to stop a monster,

52:39.948 --> 52:41.741
and that's what's coming for Trish!

52:44.286 --> 52:45.286
It's here!

52:45.996 --> 52:47.247
Take Trish, and run.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.330
Run!

52:51.167 --> 52:53.503
Here.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.297
Look after her.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.509
Simpson, wait!

53:01.011 --> 53:02.011
Take it.

53:19.237 --> 53:20.822
Shit! Come on.

53:34.419 --> 53:35.587
It wasn't after you.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.965
Simpson?

54:02.739 --> 54:06.660
Simpson was right.
It takes a monster to stop a monster.

54:07.410 --> 54:09.162
He just wasn't the right monster.
