Of course. Every kid in Leah has.

Long ago, a mystical king, poured
magic sand into the river,

She'll be safe in the Wilderun.

this, then we must act now.

26:15.155 --> 26:17.622
you foretold that another

I trained Bandon,
believing he was the one.

I pushed him to control his powers.

the path of darkness.

Riga killed him.

36:17.552 --> 36:19.439
He was a good man.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.118
But now that he's gone, what
will become of the Elvin people?

36:23.124 --> 36:25.952
I mean, he was the last
in the royal line.

36:29.042 --> 36:30.742
Except he's wasn't.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.597
- What?
- Ander wasn't the last.

36:35.603 --> 36:38.667
His father, his brothers. Even Amberele.

36:38.673 --> 36:40.835
King Eventine's sister had a child.

36:40.842 --> 36:42.260
A girl.

36:43.176 --> 36:44.204
Mareth.

36:44.712 --> 36:47.080
Mareth is the next in line
for the throne of Arborlon.

36:56.991 --> 36:58.124
MARETH: A Druid sword?

36:59.354 --> 37:00.434
Of my own?

37:01.463 --> 37:02.728
It is time.

37:09.471 --> 37:10.603
How does it work?

37:12.540 --> 37:13.873
You must focus.

37:22.217 --> 37:24.750
Try to clear your mind of distractions.

37:28.556 --> 37:29.989
(SWORD CLINKING)

37:35.463 --> 37:36.629
Very good.

37:39.134 --> 37:41.834
Now you must learn how
to use this to fight.
