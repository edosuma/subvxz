Oh.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.253
Oh, my God.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.171
How stupid can I get?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
Brr.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.164
Meow.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.790
Meow.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.089
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

02:11.381 --> 02:14.009
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

♪ Somebody said it can be here

02:18.013 --> 02:21.725

tied up, dead in a year

♪ One by one they all

02:44.122 --> 02:46.583
Annie, if you're not dying,
I'm gonna murder you.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.251
I had to remove my night cream.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.003
It's $200 an ounce.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.756
It's 3:00 a.m. in the
fricking morning, Edison.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.768
What gives you the right
to haul us in here?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.520
Chang, how did you
even find out about this?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.221
I have a right to be here.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.513
Hi!

03:01.640 --> 03:02.974
Why are you so awake?

03:03.266 --> 03:05.506
I have a theory about this.
Britta may be secretly twins.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.895
No, I was working. At the bar?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.397
Does that mean you're drunk?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.732
Uh, could a drunk person
do this?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.199
Hi, everybody.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.992
Jeffrey.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.995
Okay, 41 minutes ago,
I received this email

03:24.287 --> 03:25.914
from a friend
that interns at KZBC.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.206
The TV station?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.612
No, the unrelated,
totally random

03:28.875 --> 03:30.460
combination
of those four letters.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.211
Meow.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.462
"Subject, heads up."

03:33.714 --> 03:35.340
"Annie,
still going to Greendale?"

03:35.632 --> 03:36.712
"Thought you should know,."

03:36.758 --> 03:38.427
"City College
is running a negative ad"

03:38.719 --> 03:40.429
"about your school at 7:00 a.m."

03:40.721 --> 03:41.888
"Heard it's pretty bad."

03:42.597 --> 03:43.640
Let me see that.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.809
City College
is running an attack ad?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.561
That's a first.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.456
They're getting desperate. Our
registration numbers are trending upward.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.107
Because the population
keeps growing

03:52.399 --> 03:53.817
and no one here ever graduates.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.229
Actually, our numbers are up

03:55.360 --> 03:56.903
because of improvements
Frankie's made.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.281
Those improvements
were only possible

03:59.573 --> 04:00.773
through your hard work, Annie.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.367
Oh, get a boardroom.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.370
Interesting. When were you gonna
share the whole truth about this

04:05.662 --> 04:07.205
and not just the parts
that suit you?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.707
What?

04:08.999 --> 04:11.501
"P.S. I was glad to hear
Brenda's doing better"?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.253
Huh? Huh?

04:14.880 --> 04:15.922
Eh...

04:17.632 --> 04:19.301
Just because City College
is scared

04:19.593 --> 04:20.969
doesn't mean
they're not dangerous.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.888
Is there anything in particular

04:23.180 --> 04:24.180
they could smear us with?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.807
Nothing in particular,

04:26.099 --> 04:29.102
just overlapping clouds of many
thousands and thousands of things.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.747
Let's not forget
the Brenda factor.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.105
There isn't a Brenda factor.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.442
He says she's doing better.
Better than what?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.903
Her thyroid condition.
Can you focus?

04:38.195 --> 04:40.614
Can Brenda?
Probably more so now.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.657
Okay, we need to see
this ad before it airs.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.218
I'm working
on getting us a copy.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.179
I have friends in the A/V
department at City College.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.537
Ooh-Ia-Ia.
The brotherhood of A/V

04:47.829 --> 04:49.307
exists beyond
your petty factionalism.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.891
We serve only Video,
the one true queen,

04:50.999 --> 04:52.279
and her faithful consort, Audio.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.699
Could you guys be bigger nerds?

04:53.919 --> 04:55.813
No, most of us have achieved
our maximum potential.

04:55.837 --> 04:56.837
Well, Annie's right.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.673
We do have a situation here.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.802
So we will make this
our situation room.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.347
Yes, we need white boards,
cork boards, laptops.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.074
A bunch of clocks with
different times on them,

05:07.098 --> 05:08.338
a red phone, a big tabletop map

05:08.600 --> 05:10.161
with little Nazi tanks
and or a Godzilla.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.520
The ad airs at 7:00 a.m.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.522
That means we have...

05:13.814 --> 05:15.690
4 hours and 13 minutes
to figure out

05:15.982 --> 05:17.822
what they're throwing at us
and how to respond.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.277
You know,
it's the darnedest thing.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.738
I think Britta somehow
crapped in my pants too.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.114
Better head home.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.126
Jeff, you can't just
leave a situation room.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.119
It's only a situation room
because she called it that.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.747
I mean, I could declare it a...
cookie room.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.707
There are no cookies.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.668
There is a situation.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.170
You guys,
where's the Greendale spirit?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.839
Where's the pride?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.549
I'm fine. Found it.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.051
She was wandering around campus

05:43.343 --> 05:45.136
without pants.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.222
What's going on in here?
Situation room.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.514
What's the situation?

05:48.598 --> 05:49.678
Brenda's got a bad thyroid.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.702
I'm sorry to hear that.
You can keep the pants.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.562
I'm going back to bed.
I'm going with him.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.146
I'm gonna watch. Got it!

05:55.438 --> 05:56.731
Downloading it now.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.343
You work hard
to earn your degree,

05:58.608 --> 06:01.048
and your school should work hard
to make that degree valuable.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.905
So why is Greendale Community
College giving degrees to dogs?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.908
In 2001, a Staffordshire
terrier mix named Ruffles

06:07.200 --> 06:09.077
took up residence
on Greendale's campus.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.038
By 2008, Ruffies had earned
a bachelor's degree.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.166
Not a two-year degree,
a four-year degree.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.698
Where will you get your degree?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.963
If the answer is Greendale,
prepare to get boned.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.382
Paid for by City College.
License 264392.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.723
Did we give a degree to a dog?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.561
Oh, my God.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.897
Oh, my God! Okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.738
So this is Greendale,
not City College?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.700
I'm gonna get more pants.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.355
They've been calling me in to do more
stuff lately. It's pretty exciting.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.565
Well, trust me, we'll be lucky

07:02.589 --> 07:03.909
if we get in
three words before...

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
The first step
is to pool our facts...

07:05.884 --> 07:07.260
The most important one being...

07:07.552 --> 07:09.888
Dean Pelton, did
Greendale Community College

07:10.180 --> 07:11.932
give a degree to a dog?

07:13.725 --> 07:16.603
I seem to recall...

07:16.895 --> 07:18.021
No, no way.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.649
There's absolutely no way.
Not that dog.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.941
That dog?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.318
You remember the dog.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.612
Was it enrolled in classes?

07:26.363 --> 07:27.363
Mmm...

07:27.614 --> 07:29.032
How are these hard questions?

07:29.324 --> 07:31.910
Why are these
the questions you're asking?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.663
You don't want to know
if a dog got a degree here?

07:34.955 --> 07:35.997
It's not important.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.791
What I want to know is,

07:38.083 --> 07:40.835
did a dog get a degree here in
any way that can be proven?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.587
Ooh, I like that, Jeffrey.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.880
I don't like that.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.340
I like the truth.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.792
Play lawyer on your own time.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.802
This is my own time.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.095
You wanted me invested?

07:50.387 --> 07:52.389
Well, this dump
cuts my paychecks,

07:52.681 --> 07:55.225
and I've got three hours
to defend it.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.686
So how many seconds of that
should I waste on truth?

07:57.978 --> 08:01.022
Which is an artificial construct
that rarely holds up in court

08:01.314 --> 08:04.526
and has never changed
the outcome of a fight.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.378
I'm sorry you have
to see him like this.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.806
Well, he is right
about one thing.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.699
If City College can't support
their claim, it's libel.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.492
We can have the station
pull the ad.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.578
But that is precisely
why the truth does matter.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.497
The Brenda Paradox.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.416
I found the dog.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.018
I also found a lot of people's
Social Security numbers.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.562
You know, this Internet's
gone too far.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.631
This says she's registered
as a border terrier.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.110
They said Staffordshire in the commercial.
Isn't that something?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.695
I mean, we've known
this animal 30 seconds,

08:30.719 --> 08:32.386
and she's already unreliable.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.972
- Who is the real Ruffles?
- I'm sorry.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.392
Our strategy
is to go after the dog?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.519
Our strategy is denial,

08:39.811 --> 08:41.730
which includes
discrediting the source.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.702
Abed, can you make
one of those attack ads?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.191
Jeff wants me
to make an attack ad.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.483
So why is he a pedophile?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.226
Just demonstrating the formula.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.865
You can refine your technique
as you go.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.993
I want to know everything
about this Ruffles.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.662
She thinks she went
to this school, fine.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.540
But maybe she thinks
cat turds are delicious.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.834
And maybe she barks
just a little bit more

09:03.126 --> 09:04.127
at black mailmen.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.004
And she's spayed now,

09:06.296 --> 09:07.839
but how many puppies
are out there?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.091
If you do this, we're no
better than City College.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.023
We've never been better
than City College.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.678
We gave a degree to a dog.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.387
Allegedly.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.182
This conversation is privileged.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.560
I could do a Banksy-style
stencil of a dog

09:20.852 --> 09:22.372
and spray-paint it
all over the school.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.064
That sounds great, but first,

09:24.355 --> 09:25.875
why don't you go get
a bunch of coffee,

09:25.982 --> 09:27.108
drink all of it,

09:27.400 --> 09:29.277
then go get some more
and bring it back here?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.321
I actually love that idea.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.822
I'll go with her.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.282
She's wearing my pants.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
I know this is crazy,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.550
but I'm gonna go
check the school records

09:37.577 --> 09:39.913
to see if, you know...

09:40.205 --> 09:41.456
We gave a degree to a dog.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.788
- We didn't.
- That's good.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.335
You guys go find that truth
you love so much.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.712
If it's the kind we can use,
bring it back.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.590
If not, you know,
stuff gets lost.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.217
No, no, bad!

09:52.509 --> 09:54.177
We are better than City College.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.512
We always have been,

09:55.804 --> 09:56.805
which is why I know

09:57.097 --> 09:59.307
that we did not give a degree
to a dog.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.152
I say we fight fire with fire.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.279
City College
try to embarrass us?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.949
We should embarrass them, right?
Right.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.868
I say I go to City College
with a camera,

10:19.160 --> 10:22.288
shoot a really gross porno movie on
their campus, and put it online.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.580
Fine. Cool.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.544
Wait, what?

11:12.297 --> 11:16.342
Honestly, I couldn't care less
if they gave a dog a degree.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.887
Me neither.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.723
In fact,
I kind of hope they did.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.892
Why is that? I don't know.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.352
They all treat me
like I'm a joke.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.855
But if a dog got a degree,

11:29.147 --> 11:30.267
that means we're all a joke.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.818
Whoa...

11:34.110 --> 11:36.404
Natalie is Freezing?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.299
You know them? Yeah,
of course I know them.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.365
But how do you? You're...

11:39.657 --> 11:41.910
Black? No, old.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.162
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just meant that...

11:44.454 --> 11:45.997
When I was into them,
I was, like, 15.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.498
I was, like, 40.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.894
I never really listened to
music when I was growing up.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.920
I was in my own world.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.714
But one day at work,
I heard this sound.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.966
It was Pillar of Garbage.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.718
Oh, that is their best song.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.136
Best song.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.428
I got it right here.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.473
Would you play it? Yeah.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.855
♪ Moonlight

12:11.147 --> 12:13.358
♪ Bleeding glass
and healing needles

12:13.650 --> 12:16.611
♪ Amputated hearts
are never whole

12:18.696 --> 12:20.990
♪ Too bright

12:21.282 --> 12:23.493
♪ Dreaming
as the screaming seagulls

12:23.785 --> 12:26.704

I keep below

12:26.996 --> 12:28.122
♪ Oh, oh

12:28.414 --> 12:31.334
♪ All right, take off your belt

12:31.626 --> 12:33.711
♪ Let me go
to where your feelings

12:34.003 --> 12:36.214
♪ Glide overhead

12:36.506 --> 12:39.842
♪ But below
I've fallen dead inside

12:40.134 --> 12:41.135
♪ The-doo-doon ♪

12:41.427 --> 12:43.388
You know what?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.320
You know, those guys
are gonna need coffee

12:45.598 --> 12:47.638
if they're gonna keep that
dog from having a degree.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.186
There are things at stake here.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.688
I get that now.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.610
I found the smell.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.405
Someone filed a taco.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.157
Things that will otherwise get
filed straight to my thighs.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.785
Hmm.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.289
So, I know you agree with me
that we need to find the truth,

13:09.580 --> 13:12.333
but do you agree that the
truth won't be horrible?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.751
I'm not psychic, Annie.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.045
That's an illusion caused
by extreme preparedness.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.131
But what do you hope is true?

13:18.423 --> 13:19.674
Oh, God, no, I never hope.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.301
Hope is pouting in advance.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.803
Hope is faith's
richer, bitchier sister.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.763
Hope is the deformed,
attic-bound

13:26.055 --> 13:28.641
incest monster offspring
of entitlement and fear.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.935
My life results tripled
the year I gave up hope

13:31.227 --> 13:33.706
and every game on my phone that
had anything to do with farming.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.815
What's true will be true, Annie.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.467
Our job is to deal
with that truth.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.944
You sound a little like Jeff.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.738
Jeff said I sound like Abed.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.157
I wonder if Britta thinks
I sound like Chang.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.992
I assume Chang thinks I sound

13:46.284 --> 13:48.411
like distant explosions
and crying babies.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.903
You know he's unstable, right?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.079
Yep.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.291
Oh.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.251
A transcript for Ruffles.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.544
You think that's our guy?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.546
I do.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.594
Oh, my God.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.305
So many classes.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.559
See what hope does?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.479
Screw you, Frankie.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.314
I'm sorry, Annie.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.584
But I don't think you're
seeing this for what it is.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.902
It's a transcript for a dog.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.821
A really, really long one.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.353
It's proof that Jeff was right.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.824
This school has no value.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.202
Yeah, but this folder
has no degree.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.787
Look.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.079
What's that?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.582
Victory.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.793
You know, within
the context of Greendale.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.880
Would it be better if we... No.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.172
Never know until you try.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.758
Never know until I try. What?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.210
I said, "We're quite a team."

14:45.343 --> 14:47.553
Here's the coffee.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.782
Let me know if there's anything
else I can do to help.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.308
We could use some fresh
eyes on this cut. We could?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.911
Has anyone told you you're
difficult to work with?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.144
Everyone in your line of work.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.523
This is Ruffles.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.959
She'd like you to believe she's a
college graduate and a good girl,

15:00.983 --> 15:02.777
but Ruffles is anything but.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.613
When Ruffles moved
into her neighborhood in 2007,

15:05.905 --> 15:08.074
dead squirrels went up by 17%.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.826
Coincidence? Ask this bunny.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.845
Ruffles stole cookies
from a Girl Scout,

15:13.079 --> 15:14.580
impersonated a lobster,

15:14.872 --> 15:17.041
has had 27 children
with 5 different fathers,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.752
and according to one
local doctor, has worms.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.796
Ruffles might claim she doesn't.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.798
Ruffles claims a lot of things.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.301
Maybe that's why Ruffles
once spent time on death row.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.304
Ruffles, not a lobster,
not a student,

15:30.596 --> 15:31.806
not a good dog.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.599
Paid for by
Humanity Versus Ruffles.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.214
I originally
wanted the voiceover

15:36.394 --> 15:37.788
to be a James Earl Jones
impersonator,

15:37.812 --> 15:40.731
but the James Spader impersonator
turned out pretty good.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.183
I do wish he'd leave, though.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.341
You really let that dog have it.
Yeah.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.866
Which I realize
is important now.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.510
Right, is it okay
if I crash on the...

15:51.534 --> 15:52.534
Yes. Yes.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.043
What are you doing?
Nothing at all.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.420
I wouldn't say that.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.632
You just put five huge
cans of olives next to me.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.467
Just something
I felt like doing.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.438
This isn't the first time
you've done this.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.764
I'm really confused by this.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.642
Is it code for something?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.019
I don't know.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.480
And I don't care.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.734
Jackpot, relative to Greendale.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.988
Oh, my God.
Look at the course load.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.448
This dog was an animal.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.100
Most of them
were attendance-based.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.577
How is this good news?

16:34.869 --> 16:36.954
"Unpaid library fees, $15."

16:37.246 --> 16:39.582
"Diploma withheld
until payment remitted."

16:40.374 --> 16:41.667
No degree.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.294
The commercial's a lie.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.731
I'm gonna call the station right
now and have them pull the ad.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.840
Eat crap, Ruffles,
and not just your own.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.218
Guys, let it go.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.594
What are you talking about?

16:51.886 --> 16:54.305
The sad truth is that a dog
can get a degree here.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.349
Yeah, but the happy truth is,
none did.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.018
There's a difference
between truth and honesty.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.187
Library dues?

17:01.479 --> 17:02.772
Who cares?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.107
Ruffles put the work in,
relative to Greendale.

17:05.398 --> 17:08.819
That City College ad
may be technically a lie,

17:09.111 --> 17:12.656
but it's really dishonest to
kill it on a technicality.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.617
And dragging this dog's
name through the mud?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.954
That's worse than dishonest.
That's evil.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.579
Evil?

17:19.872 --> 17:20.872
I'll cop to silly.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.238
Some things are silly and evil,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.085
like candy cigarettes.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.416
And remember when Flavor Flav
had that reality show?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.546
I don't own a TV.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.927
Honestly,

17:33.219 --> 17:35.513
I think the most honest
thing we can do right now,

17:35.805 --> 17:38.891
the only thing that will make
us better than City College,

17:39.183 --> 17:42.478
is to let that ad run
and take our lumps.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.772
Annie, this started
with me sleeping

17:45.064 --> 17:46.649
and getting yelled at
for not helping.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.941
If it ends with you yelling
at me for not sleeping,

17:49.026 --> 17:50.152
that's not a story.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.445
That's a German art film.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.783
Let it go. I am a female student

17:56.075 --> 17:58.035
being physically overpowered
by a male teacher!

17:58.327 --> 17:59.787
Damn it. Britta, get her.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.707
Frankie, get her.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.418
Annie, sweetie,
think about this practically.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.795
If being better
than City College

18:08.087 --> 18:09.287
means letting them destroy us,

18:09.547 --> 18:10.548
what is the point?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.593
If surviving means
being like them,

18:13.884 --> 18:16.053
what's the point?

18:16.345 --> 18:17.638
Why not let one school die

18:17.930 --> 18:20.224
and enroll at the one
where my grades matter?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.769
If those are your terms,

18:24.061 --> 18:26.188
if the price of that transcript
is you transferring...

18:33.362 --> 18:34.488
We accept.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.282
Personally,
I hope you're bluffing.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.786
Yeah, well,
here's what hope gets you.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.678
Hope and $1 .49
will get you a candy bar.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.955
Buck 79.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.541
Are you serious? Jesus.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.629
Have fun with your lying,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.340
cheating... dog-smearing,

18:53.007 --> 18:55.051
truth-blurring...

18:55.343 --> 18:56.927
trouser-swapping school!

18:59.764 --> 19:02.308
I remember when
candy bars were 50 cents.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.811
If someone said,
"Hey, I just joined MENSA,"

19:06.103 --> 19:08.856
or "I consider myself
a postmodern this or that,"

19:09.148 --> 19:10.858
you could say, "Yeah,
that and 50 cents"

19:11.150 --> 19:12.230
"will get you a candy bar,"

19:12.318 --> 19:14.612
or "That and a quarter
will get you a phone call."

19:16.364 --> 19:18.908
It was easy to be
unimpressed back then.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.619
I mean, it was
literally cheaper.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.788
Elroy, we're kind of
bummed out right now.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.080
Annie just left.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.374
Oh.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.543
Were you guys close?

19:56.445 --> 19:57.885
Abed, I don't want
to talk right now.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.072
Okay.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.680
Just so you know, the Greendale
ad is gonna go up anytime now.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.984
Thought you might
want to see it.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.182
You know I don't
want to be a part of that.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.207
Just trust me.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.672
This is Ruffles.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.466
Ruffles was a student at
Greendale Community College.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.635
She came really close
to getting a degree,

20:19.927 --> 20:21.178
which means two things.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.305
She's an exceptional dog,

20:23.597 --> 20:26.517
and Greendale really needs
to get its together.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.018
We're working on it.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.910
We're working hard.
And the good news is,

20:30.146 --> 20:31.426
when you work hard at Greendale,

20:31.647 --> 20:34.150
no matter who or what you are,

20:34.442 --> 20:35.776
it pays off.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.361
Right, Ruffles?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.654
Oh, Jesus.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.073
Greendale Community College,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.033
you're already accepted.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.371
You guys!

20:47.663 --> 20:49.206
I knew you wouldn't
do that to Ruffles.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.498
You hoped.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.792
I hoped, and it worked.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.252
Hope points.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.545
Hope points.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.338
You do understand
that what we did

20:56.630 --> 20:58.275
was also just the most
prudent tactical move,

20:58.299 --> 21:00.676
getting in front of the
scandal, Letterman-style.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.763
Yes, Jeff, don't worry.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.640
I promise I'll never mistake
you for having a heart.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.435
Kiss City College good-bye.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.103
I did it.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.147
Did what? That stuff
we talked about.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.984
- Who are you?
- I'm the plumber.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.153
- Why?
- Here's why.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.571
Oh, my God.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.453
Is this pornography?

21:27.745 --> 21:28.745
Doy.

21:28.871 --> 21:29.871
You're the only actor.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.039
So?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.688
What kind of lens is this?
Who cares?

21:34.919 --> 21:37.505
You might be a genius.
Why did you do this?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.837
What parent is gonna let
their kid go to this school

21:39.965 --> 21:41.509
if a porn got shot there?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.070
But you shot it in front of a plaster wall.
That could be anywhere.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.655
And you're wearing
your Greendale t-shirt.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.306
Okay, genius.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.601
But the title is
"Chang Does Greendale."

21:51.811 --> 21:53.020
Oh, wait.

21:59.777 --> 22:00.945
Re-shoot.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.753
I often think about that night.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.588
Such a small event,

23:42.880 --> 23:44.924
but ultimately the moment

23:45.215 --> 23:48.010
that would lead me
to becoming oyabun,

23:48.969 --> 23:51.305
highest leader of the Yakuza.
