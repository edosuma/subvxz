>> THE WINNER OF THIS MO WE
AREFUL COIN WILL FORCE THE CENT

00:57.792 --> 01:00.206
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD INTO A COIN
FLIP FOR POWER.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.793
IF THE WINNER OF THE COIN CALLS

IMMEDIATELY DETHRONE ME AND
SECRETLY TAKE OVER ALL OF MY

01:08.655 --> 01:09.757

COMPLETELY FROM THE SHADOWS, HOW
WILL HER ANONYMOUS REIGN SHAKE

UP THE GAME.

02:05.275 --> 02:07.067
PLUS THE POWER OF VETO IS ON THE
LINE.

02:07.102 --> 02:12.000
WILL IT STAVE ONE OF THE THREE
NOMINEES FROM THE CHOPPING

02:12.033 --> 02:12.826
BLOCK?

02:12.861 --> 02:22.861
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER."

>> THE SECRET H.O.H.'S NOMINEES
ARE LOCKED.

02:33.137 --> 02:43.378
AND THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM IS
OFFICIALLY CLOSED.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.550
>> I HAVE BEEN DETHRONED.

02:46.586 --> 02:50.000
A LOSE ALL OF MY POWERS THIS
WEEK, EVEN MY BEAUTIFUL H.O.H.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.240
ROOM.

02:51.275 --> 02:54.310
HOWEVER THE SECRET H.O.H. KEPT
MY NOMINATIONS THE SAME SO I'M

02:54.343 --> 02:59.137
THINKING IT HAS TO BE MY GIRL
CLAIRE WHO WON THE COIN OF

02:59.171 --> 03:00.378
DESTINY.

03:00.413 --> 03:03.931
AND THAT MEANS I STILL HAVE A
GREAT CHANCE OF GETTING SARAH

03:03.965 --> 03:08.655
BETH OUT OF THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.448
>> YOU DO GET TO PLAY NEXT WEEK.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.171
>> THAT'S TRUE.

03:11.205 --> 03:13.205
>> YOU DO GET TO PLAY NEXT WEEK.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.275
>> I'M FINE.

03:14.310 --> 03:17.310
>> IT ST AMAZING TO BE THE
SECRET H.O.H. AND I JUST

03:17.343 --> 03:20.965
NOMINATED KYLAND AND SARAH BETH
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT TIFFANY WANTSL

03:21.000 --> 03:23.205
AND I AM WORKING CLOSELY WITH
TIFFANY IN THIS GAME.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.448
I KNOW THAT TIFFANY'S TARGET
THIS WEEK IS SARAH BETH BUT IN

03:27.481 --> 03:33.067
I'M BEING REAL, ANY OF THESE
PEOPLE COULD GO TO JURY AND I

03:33.103 --> 03:35.723
WOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

03:35.758 --> 03:36.275
>> GOOD LUCK IN VETO.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.826
>> THANK YOU.

03:37.861 --> 03:39.137
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:39.171 --> 03:41.343
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED WITH THESE
NOMINATIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE

03:41.378 --> 03:46.826
IS A PLAN FOR CLAIRE TO WIN
SECRET H.O.H. AND KEEP THE

03:46.861 --> 03:49.033
NOMINATIONS SAFE.

03:49.067 --> 03:55.343
>>-- WE KIND OF WANT
HER-- BECAUSE IF SHE WINS THEN

03:55.378 --> 03:58.033
SHE IS INELIGIBLE TO PLAY H.O.H.

03:58.067 --> 04:01.033
>> AND IF CLAIRE WINS SHE'S
KEEPING THEM THE SAME.

04:01.068 --> 04:03.550
>> SHE DEFINITELY WANTS TO KEEP
THEM THE SAME.

04:03.586 --> 04:06.481
>> KNOWING THIS IS TO BRACE FOR
IT T IF YOU BRACE FOR THE IMPACT

04:06.516 --> 04:10.861
OF A BAT SWINGING AT YOUR FACE,
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT THURT ANY

04:10.896 --> 04:12.000
LESS.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.620
>> ON THE BLOCK, IT DIDN'T GO
ANYWHERE.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.000
>> BECAUSE I TOOK A PUNCH IN THE
VETO COMPETITION LAST WEEK I'M

04:18.033 --> 04:19.310
STILL THE SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.516
I SHOULD BE OKAY THIS WEEK GIVEN
THAT SARAH BETH IS ON THE BLOCK

04:22.550 --> 04:26.550
AND SHE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE
COOKOUT, THAT BEING SAID, I

04:26.586 --> 04:29.793
WOULD PREFER NOT TO IT BE
SITTING ON THE BLOCK COME

04:29.826 --> 04:38.413
EVICTION NIGHT SO I'M GOING FOR
THE VETO.

04:38.447 --> 04:43.896
>> WHEN I SEE THE NOM HASN'T
CHANGED I KNOW MY GAME IS IN

04:43.930 --> 04:45.103
CERTIFICATE QUUS TROUBLE.

04:45.137 --> 04:48.896
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL IT IS
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO BE ON THE

04:48.930 --> 04:50.172
BLOCK NEXT TO DIE LAND.

04:50.206 --> 04:58.826
I DON'T WANT TO SEE KYLAND GO
HOME BUT I ALSO CAN'T LET IT BE

04:58.862 --> 05:02.240
ME.

05:02.274 --> 05:04.586
>> DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING YOUR
STUFF.

05:04.620 --> 05:09.481
>> I MIGHT AS WELL.

05:09.516 --> 05:17.964
>> I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING
TO BE HERE FOR A WEEK.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.481
>> SORRY I OVER-- YOU, TELL
PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.

05:22.516 --> 05:24.862
>> THEY DON'T KNOW IF I PLAYED
OR NOT.

05:24.896 --> 05:33.343
SO I CAN STILL ACT LIKE I
DETHRONED MYSELF.

05:33.379 --> 05:37.550
IT TWOO BE ME LYING TO EVERYBODY
BUT CAN I ONLY LIE IF WE ALL

05:37.586 --> 05:38.793
STICK WITH IT.

05:38.826 --> 05:41.757
>> I WANT THE HOUSE TO THINK
THAT I AM THE SECRET H.O.H. THIS

05:41.793 --> 05:42.723
WEEK.

05:42.757 --> 05:48.550
I DON'T WANT ANYONE GETTING IN
CLAIRE'S EAR.

05:48.586 --> 05:51.586
>>-- THAT ARE YOU THE ONE WHO
PLAYED AND DETHRONED YOURSELF,

05:51.620 --> 05:55.033
THAT WAY CLAIRE CAN STAY UNDER
THE RADAR AND JUST COLLABORATE.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.586
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I DON'T WANT

05:57.620 --> 05:59.896
YOU TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

05:59.930 --> 06:01.310
>> YEAH.

06:01.343 --> 06:05.550
>> AND I WANT THE GUILT OFF.

06:05.586 --> 06:07.137
>> I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

06:07.172 --> 06:10.896
>> I'M THRILLED THAT TIFFANY
WANTS TO TRY TO GET THE BLOOD ON

06:10.930 --> 06:18.172
HER OWN HAND THIS WEEK AND CLAIM
THAT SHE OVERTHROUGH-- OVERTHREW

06:18.206 --> 06:19.447
HERSELF.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.896
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT FEELS
LIKE I'M NOT REALLY GETTING THE

06:20.930 --> 06:22.413
FULL BENEFIT OF BEING H.O.H.

06:22.447 --> 06:23.930
I WANT SOME CREDIT TO THIS.

06:23.964 --> 06:27.793
I DON'T WANT THIS JUST TO BE
SEEN AS TIFFANY'S MOOD.

06:27.826 --> 06:41.447
>> I'M TRYING TO THINK OF
SOMETHING-- .

06:41.481 --> 06:46.862
>> EVEN ANONYMOUSLY THIS IS THE
SHOT PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE?

06:46.896 --> 06:51.689
FOR WHAT REASON.

06:51.723 --> 06:52.862
>> DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

06:52.896 --> 06:57.067
WE'RE JUST NOT LIKABLE.

06:57.103 --> 06:57.689
>> DON'T-- STOP.

06:57.723 --> 07:03.896
>> NO, I'M BEING SERIOUS.

07:03.930 --> 07:10.896
>> I THINK IT IS, KYLAND.

07:10.930 --> 07:19.413
>> YOU THINK PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE
TRAVIS, DIDN'T LIKE BABY D.

07:19.447 --> 07:22.896
>> NO, I THINK THEY DID, I THINK
THIS' WHY I'M SITTING HERE.

07:22.930 --> 07:26.826
>> IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE SOMEONE
THAT YOU-- SEE SOMEONE YOU CARE

07:26.862 --> 07:28.103
ABOUT IN PAIN.

07:28.137 --> 07:32.930
THIS IS EXTRA HARD BECAUSE SARAH
BETH IS MY BEST FRIEND AND I'M

07:32.965 --> 07:36.862
NOT ABLE TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH HER.

07:36.896 --> 07:41.826
>> I JUST FEEL DEFEATED BECAUSE
I FEEL LIKE UNLESS I'M JUST

07:41.862 --> 07:45.586
COMPLETELY MISSING SOMETHING,
UNLESS I'M JUST COMPLETELY

07:45.620 --> 07:49.206
CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT THE DYNAMIC
OF THIS HOUSE IS IT JUST SEEMS

07:49.240 --> 07:53.206
LIKE A BETTER GAME MOVE TO NOT
GO AFTER TWO PEOPLE THAT CLEARLY

07:53.240 --> 08:00.723
EVERYBODY IS TARGETING WHEN YOU
HAVE A SECRET H.O.H.

08:00.757 --> 08:03.930
>> UNLESS I ARE NOT PLAYING
STRATEGICALLY.

08:03.964 --> 08:07.964
AND IF ARE YOU NOT PLAYING
STRATEGICALLY, SEND ME HOME NOW,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.481
I DON'T HAVE ANY FIGHT AGAINST
THAT, I AM NOT SAYING I WON'T

08:12.516 --> 08:13.137
TRY.

08:13.172 --> 08:16.550
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I FEEL.

08:16.586 --> 08:22.033
>> THE THING NOW IS THAT WITH NO
H.O.H. THE PUBLIC CAN APPLY

08:22.067 --> 08:23.896
PRESSURE, IT GIVES US MORE
LEVERAGE.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.516
>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEVERAGE,
KYLAND.

08:26.550 --> 08:29.206
LITERALLY SOMEONE HO HAD A
SECRET OPPORTUNITY TO NOMINATE

08:29.240 --> 08:39.931
PEOPLE CHOSE TO NOMINATE US.

08:39.965 --> 08:43.931
>> WIN THE VETO, LIKE YOU CAME
HERE TO DO.

08:43.965 --> 08:45.000
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:45.033 --> 08:50.102
IF ONE OF US IS ON THE BLOCK,
THEY'RE GOING HOME.

08:50.136 --> 08:52.861
>> KYLAND AND I GOT NOMINATED
TWICE THIS WEEK.

08:52.895 --> 08:56.758
IF THAT IS NOT A TARGET, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT IS.

08:56.793 --> 09:00.000
THE BEST CHANCE FOR US TO BOTH
SURVIVE IS IF ONE OF US WINS THE

09:00.033 --> 09:02.309
VETO.

09:02.344 --> 09:03.344
>> CAY CERA CERA.

09:16.413 --> 09:19.033
>> HEY OTHER THAN, IT'S TIME TO
PICK PLAYERS FOR THE VETO

09:19.067 --> 09:20.724
COMPETITION.

09:26.724 --> 09:30.274
>> ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

09:30.309 --> 09:31.586
COMPETITION.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.344

NOMINEE, THE TWO OTHER NOMINEES

09:34.379 --> 09:37.240
AND THREE OTHER PLAYERS SELECTED
BY RANDOM DRAW.

09:37.274 --> 09:41.033
TO CONTINUE TO CONCEAL THEIR
IDENTITY THE SECRET HEAD OF

09:41.067 --> 09:45.586
HOUSEHOLD WILL ONLY EXET IF HIS
OR HER CHIP IS CHOSEN BY RANDOM

09:45.620 --> 09:46.586
DRAW.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.309
WILL THE OTHER NOMINEES PLEASE
JOIN ME UP HERE.

09:50.344 --> 09:54.067
>> I WANT TO GET PICKED FOR VETO
SO I CAN WIN IT TAND TAKE

09:54.102 --> 09:55.344
X-ZAVIER OFF THE BLOCK.

09:55.379 --> 09:57.551
IF HE COMESES DOWN THERE IS NO
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE, THEN KYLAND

09:57.586 --> 10:01.931
AND SARAH BETH WILL BOTH BE ON
THE BLOCK COME EVICTION NIGHT.

10:01.965 --> 10:06.172
>> AS THE SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE,
I WILL PICK FIRST.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.586
I'M HOPING TO PICK ALYSSA
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WON THE

10:08.620 --> 10:11.758
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO SHE WOULD
TAKE ME OFF THE BLOCK, IN THE

10:11.793 --> 10:16.274
EENT THAT I DON'T WIN MYSELF.

10:16.309 --> 10:17.895
>> NO WAY.

10:17.931 --> 10:19.206
ALYSSA.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.206
>> YES.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.067
>> OH MY GOD.

10:24.102 --> 10:24.379
>> HOW MANY VETOES HAVE YOU
PLAYED IN.

10:24.413 --> 10:25.654
>> SIX.

10:25.688 --> 10:27.309
>> MI SO EXCITED, I GOT PICKED
TO PLAY IN THE VETO COMPETITION

10:27.344 --> 10:28.551
THIS WEEK.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.481
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE
SECRET H.O.H. IS BUT I DO FEEL

10:30.517 --> 10:33.758
LIKE I COULD PROBABLY BE A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE IF SARAH

10:33.793 --> 10:39.758
BETH OR KYLAND GET OFF THE BLOCK
MAINLY BECAUSE X-ZAVIER IS

10:39.793 --> 10:41.688
ALREADY THERE AND PEOPLE SEE US
AS A STRONG DUO.

10:41.724 --> 10:48.240
>> I'M HELPING I PICK DEREK X, I
FEEL LIKE I COULD BEAT HIM IN

10:48.274 --> 10:51.965
ANY VETO COMPETITION SO I FEEL
LIKE IT A SAFE BET.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.826
>> CLAIRE.

10:52.861 --> 10:53.793
>> IT'S VERY LUCKY THAT I GOT
PICKED.

10:53.826 --> 10:55.654
IN A NORMAL WEEK THE H.O.H.

10:55.688 --> 10:59.240
ALWAYS PLAYS FOR VETO BUT
BECAUSE I'M THE SECRET H.O.H.

10:59.274 --> 11:03.344
AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE
DOES NOT KNOW, IT WASN'T

11:03.379 --> 11:04.620
GUARANTEED THAT I WOULD PLAY.

11:04.654 --> 11:14.654
BUT NOW I CAN COMPETE AND IF I
WIN, THEN I HAVE ALL THE POWER.

11:14.654 --> 11:21.033
BUT NOW I CAN COMPETE AND IF I
WIN, THEN I HAVE ALL THE POWER.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.172
>> HANNAH.

11:22.206 --> 11:24.826
>> OH MY GOSH, I'M SO HYPED TO
PLAY IN THIS WEEK'S VETO

11:24.861 --> 11:26.102
COMPETITION.

11:26.136 --> 11:28.861
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT I FINALLY
WIN SOMETHING AND GET SOME POWER

11:28.895 --> 11:30.067
IN THIS HOUSE.

11:30.102 --> 11:33.000
>> BIG BROTHER WILL INFORM US
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO

11:33.033 --> 11:36.240
BEGIN.

11:36.274 --> 11:48.240
GOOD LUCK.

11:48.274 --> 11:58.309
>> THEY CAN'T PROVE IT.

11:58.309 --> 12:08.274
>> THEY CAN'T PROVE IT.

12:08.309 --> 12:18.102
>> I DON'T KNOW.

12:18.136 --> 12:22.067
TIFFANY HAS WANTED TO GFER A
SARAH BETH FOR WEEKS NOW.

12:22.102 --> 12:25.206
AND I HAVE BEEN IN SUPPORT OF
HER, BUT I'M THE SECRET H.O.H.,

12:25.240 --> 12:29.586
SO I REALLY NEED TO DECIDE IS
GOING AFTER SARAH BETH WHAT I

12:29.620 --> 12:30.688
WANT TO DO?

12:30.724 --> 12:36.240
OR IS IT JUST WHAT TIFFANY WANTS
TO DO?

12:36.274 --> 12:40.240
>> BEING.

12:40.274 --> 12:47.551
>> I.

12:47.586 --> 12:52.240
>> IF I HAD MY WAY, X
DISPLAIFIER WOULD PROBABLY BE

12:52.274 --> 12:53.517
LEAVING THIS WEEK.

12:53.551 --> 12:56.826
AND IF I WIN THE VETO THEN HEY,
CAN I TAKE WHOEVER I WANT DOWN

12:56.861 --> 12:59.344
AND PUT WHOEVER I WANT UP THERE.

12:59.379 --> 13:04.000
AND THIS WEEK COULD END UP
LOOKING VERY DIFFERENT.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
>> HEY EVERYBODY, LET'S GATHER
IN THE LIVING ROOM, BIG BROTHER

LOOK FOR CLUES IN EACH PHOTO TO
DETERMINE THE CHRONOLOGICAL

15:33.861 --> 15:36.447

16:29.793 --> 16:31.965
THIS WIN.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.206
>> OKAY.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.413
I KNOW HAVE I TO PUT THESE TEN
PHOTOS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER

16:36.447 --> 16:39.379
BUT THERE IS A LOT GOES ON HERE.

16:39.413 --> 16:43.309
RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT TO ROUGHLY
PUT THEM ON THE WALL SO THAT I

16:43.344 --> 16:48.379
CAN EVALUATE WHAT DETAILS DO I
NEED TO BE LOOKING AT.

16:48.413 --> 16:51.413
>> SO WHITNEY STILL HAS IT.

16:51.447 --> 16:53.136
>> HAVE I THEM ALL STACKED UP
BUT NOW I NEED TO START LOOKING

16:53.172 --> 16:58.413
AT CLUES TO SEE WHERE DO THEY GO
IN THIS TIME LINE.

16:58.447 --> 17:00.136
>> I SEE THIS.

17:00.172 --> 17:02.965
>> THE MOST OBVIOUS THING TO SEE
IS THE CAT BECAUSE CHRISTIAN HAS

17:03.000 --> 17:06.448
A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIGNATURES ON
THIS.

17:06.481 --> 17:09.723
CLEARLY IT PUS GO FIRST AND THEN
AS IT GOES ON IN TIME, MORE AND

17:09.758 --> 17:11.964
MORE SIGNATURES GET ADDED.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.172
>> BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

17:13.205 --> 17:17.067
>> IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE SOME
SCIENCE EXPERIMENT WENT WRONG

17:17.103 --> 17:22.344
WITH TRAVIS BECAUSE HE HAS-- ALL
OVER HIM, HIS HAIR IS LOOKING

17:22.378 --> 17:23.481
WILD.

17:23.517 --> 17:25.034
>> I ASSUME THIS MUST HAVE
HAPPENED LATER IN THE STORY

17:25.067 --> 17:30.309
BECAUSE IN ALL THE OTHER PHOTOS
HE LOOKS NORMAL.

17:30.344 --> 17:31.550
>> BRENT GETS THE BLACK EYE.

17:31.586 --> 17:34.275
OKAY, BRENT IS GETTING HIT WITH
A DODGEBALL IN ONE OF THESE

17:34.309 --> 17:38.550
PHOTOS AND HE HAS A BLACK EYE
AND A IN A BUNCH OF THEM.

17:38.586 --> 17:41.205
BUT IN THIS PHOTO HE DOESN'T
HAVE THE BLACK EYE YET IT MUST

17:41.240 --> 17:45.034
COME BEFORE HIM GETTING HIT WITH
THE DODGEBALL.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.205
OKAY.

17:46.240 --> 17:51.448
LET'S GET THIS IN THE RIGHT
ORDER AND LET'S KEEP GOING.

17:51.481 --> 17:57.309
>> I TOOK-- IT IS BETTER BUZZ IN
AND CHECK, I SWRS WANT THAT FAST

17:57.344 --> 17:58.378
MEDIA-- IMMEDIATE CONFIRMATION
IS THIS RIGHT OR NOT.

17:58.413 --> 18:03.067
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT.

18:03.103 --> 18:06.067
>> OKAY, I KNOW THAT SOMETHING
IS WRONG HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW

18:06.103 --> 18:09.448
WHICH ONE EXACTLY.

18:09.481 --> 18:10.481
>> OKAY.

18:10.517 --> 18:12.826
BRITINI IS YOUR HOMEWORK, I
THINK THIS IS RIGHT.

18:12.862 --> 18:16.619
OH, I THINK THAT THIS IS
FRENCHIE'S SPIDER, FRENCHIE'S

18:16.654 --> 18:21.619
SPIDER IN THE CAGE IN SOME OF
THESE AND NOT IN THE CAGE IN

18:21.654 --> 18:22.826
OTHERS.

18:22.862 --> 18:24.448
MAKING SURE THAT THE SPIDER IN
THE CAGE GO BEFORE THE ONES

18:24.481 --> 18:27.309
WHERE THE SPIDER OUT OF THE
CAGE.

18:27.344 --> 18:33.034
>> OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED AT THIS
POINT.

18:33.067 --> 18:36.413
TRAVIS, TRAVIS WHITNEY, WHITNEY.

18:36.448 --> 18:42.205
>> WHITNEY HAS AN IMPACT BLUE IN
MOST OF THE PHOTOS BUT IN THE

18:42.240 --> 18:47.448
CHEMISTRY LAB IT LOOKS LIKE
TRAVIS EXPLOSION HAS BROKEN THE

18:47.481 --> 18:49.689
FLUTE SO I AM PUTTING IT AT THE
END OF THE SEQUENCE.

18:49.723 --> 18:55.448
ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO, LET'S
CHECK.

18:55.481 --> 19:00.240
WRONG AGAIN.

19:00.275 --> 19:03.586
DNS DEREK'S APPLE HAS BEEN BIT
ENBUT IT MUST HAVE COME AFTER

19:03.619 --> 19:07.172
THE GRAY FRAME WHERE HE HASN'T
BIT ENTHE APPLE YET.

19:07.205 --> 19:10.378
DEREK X IS VERY SMART BUT HE CAN
NOT TRAVEL IN TIME PEOPLE.

19:10.413 --> 19:23.344
>> APP SELL NOT EATEN.

19:23.378 --> 19:24.481
WITHIN COME ON.

19:24.517 --> 19:27.448
DANG APPLE.

19:27.481 --> 19:39.586
OF COURSE DEREK X MESSED ME UP.

19:39.619 --> 19:45.275
I WANT TO WIN THIS VETO AND TAKE
MYSELF DOWN.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.550
MY MAIN STRATEGY GOING INTO THE
COMPETITION IS-- FIRST THING I

19:49.586 --> 19:53.378
DO, LAY UT ALL THE PIECES AND
IMMEDIATELY HIT THE BUTTON.

19:53.413 --> 19:57.964
I'M 99 PERCENT SURE THAT I'M
WRONG SO I FIGURE WHY NOT.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.103
>> JUST IN CASE.

19:59.136 --> 19:59.826
>> CHECK.

19:59.862 --> 20:03.448
>> NO SURPRISE TO ME, I'M WRONG.

20:03.481 --> 20:10.172
>> THE BLACK EYEWITNESSES I
DOANT KNOW WHICH PIECES I NEED

20:10.205 --> 20:17.550
TO REARRANGE BUT MI SEEING THE
ITEMS I NEED TO FOCUS ON.

20:17.586 --> 20:18.792
>> THIS ONE HOMEWORK IS EATEN.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.862
>> I SEE BRITINI HOMEWORK AND
THE DAWK TALKING A BITE OUT OF

20:21.895 --> 20:23.034
IT.

20:23.067 --> 20:25.136
>> I KNOW THESE NEED TO
REARRANGE SO I MOVE THEM AND HIT

20:25.172 --> 20:28.000
THE BUZZER JUST IN CHASE.

20:28.034 --> 20:31.448
STILL WRONGK MAKES SENSE, LOTS
OF OTHER THING I NEED TO DO.

20:31.481 --> 20:38.826
>> BUT THE APPLE IS WHOLE, HOW
IS THIS-- I'M REARRANGING THE

20:38.862 --> 20:41.895
PHOTOS, I THINK I ARE SOMETHING
THAT MAKES SENSE, I WILL HIT THE

20:41.931 --> 20:49.240
BUZZER HOPEFULLY FOR THE LAST
TIME.

20:49.275 --> 20:52.067
>> I'M GLAD TO BE DONE WITH
THIS, I KNOW I WAS MOVING FAST,

20:52.103 --> 21:02.172
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

21:02.205 --> 21:05.792
>> I REALLY WANT TO WIN POT WE
ARE OF VETO BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO

21:05.826 --> 21:09.826
I WANT TO TAKE X-ZAVIER OFF THE
BLOCK BUT I FEEL LIKE I COULD

21:09.862 --> 21:14.172
POSSIBLY BE THE REPLACEMENT
NOMINEE IF KYLAND OR SARAH BETH

21:14.205 --> 21:18.448
COMES DOWN AND I DO NOT WANT US
SITTING NEXT TO TEACH OTHER ON

21:18.481 --> 21:22.826
LIVE EVICTION.

21:22.862 --> 21:26.481
THESE PHOTOS ARE PRETTY
HILARIOUS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

21:26.517 --> 21:27.758
THEY SUIT THE PERSON SO WELL.

21:27.792 --> 21:32.034
IT IS NICE SEEING CHRISTIAN, I'M
A LITTLE PISSED THOUGH THAT HE

21:32.067 --> 21:36.413
DIDN'T HAVE ME SIGN HIS CAST.

21:36.448 --> 21:37.723
OKAY.

21:37.758 --> 21:40.136
>> I'M GETTING SO FRUSTRATED IN
THIS COMPETITION BECAUSE I DON'T

21:40.172 --> 21:46.136
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT.

21:46.172 --> 21:50.172
>> OH MY GOD I HIT THE BUZZER
AND IT'S WRONG AND I DON'T KNOW

21:50.205 --> 21:56.586
WHICH ONE TO MOVE AROUND.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.586
OH MY GOD.

21:57.619 --> 21:58.517
OH MY DPOD.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.931
I'M GOING TO HEAR THAT BUZZER IN
MY SLEEP.

22:00.964 --> 22:15.240
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE NIGHTMARES
OF IT I'LL NOT GOING TO GET

22:15.275 --> 22:16.240
THIS.

22:16.275 --> 22:24.000
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT WE
HAVE GOT HERE.

22:24.034 --> 22:26.172
BECAUSE OF THE VETO COMPETITION
LAST WEEK ONE OF MY PUNISHMENTS

22:26.205 --> 22:27.448
IS TO BE A THIRD NOMINEE.

22:27.481 --> 22:31.758
SO I DO HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES
TO WIN THIS VETO COMPETITION TO

22:31.792 --> 22:35.964
SIMPLY ENSURE MY SAFETY FOR THIS
WEEK.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.413
MY MINDSET IS TO GET ALL THESE
PICTURES UP, FROM THERE I CAN

22:42.448 --> 22:43.413
ASSESS.

22:43.448 --> 22:44.103
>> CHRISTIAN BROKE HIS ARM.

22:44.136 --> 22:47.136
WE GOT TWO NAMES ON THAT ONE.

22:47.172 --> 22:50.240
>> I SEE CHRISTIAN, HE HAS
BROKEN HIS ARM.

22:50.275 --> 22:53.136
I'M LIKE CHRISTIAN, WHAT DID YOU
DO THIS TIME.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.240
>> WHITNEY.

22:54.275 --> 22:57.275
>> I SEE WHITNEY IN A
CHEERLEADING OUTFIT, YOU LOOK

22:57.309 --> 23:00.481
CUTE BUT WHY YOU GOT A FLUTE.

23:00.517 --> 23:03.034
>> THE ONE WHY DOG BRIGHTING
HOMEWORK.

23:03.067 --> 23:06.550
>> WHY IS HER DOG TAKING THESE
CHOMPS OUT OF HER HOMEWORK.

23:06.586 --> 23:10.723
>> JUST IN CASE.

23:10.758 --> 23:12.344
>> GOT IT IT.

23:12.378 --> 23:16.034
>> BEING THAT I AM A LAWYER, I
HAVE TAKEN THE DETAILS IS

23:16.067 --> 23:19.240
USUALLY SOMETHING I'M VERY GOOD
AT AM BUT THESE PHOTOS ARE ALL

23:19.275 --> 23:25.586
JUMP ELED AND MESSY AND MY BRAIN
IS NOT CLICKING.

23:25.619 --> 23:26.240
>> OKAY.

23:26.275 --> 23:27.689
WHAT IS THIS COMP.

23:27.723 --> 23:34.413
>> LET'S WIN THIS VETO.

23:34.448 --> 23:37.654
BRENT DOES NOT HAVE A BLACK EYE
IN THIS, OH TRAVIS, REMEMBER HIM

23:37.689 --> 23:38.931
BECAUSE I DON'T.

23:38.964 --> 23:41.550
LET'S START OVER HERE BECAUSE
CHRISTIAN DOES NOT HAVE THE CAST

23:41.586 --> 23:42.723
SIGNED.

23:42.758 --> 23:44.654
WE'RE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE
GAME NOW SO IT'S REALLY

23:44.689 --> 23:47.517
IMPORTANT THAT I START WINNING
SOME COMPETITIONS.

23:47.550 --> 23:52.481
BRENT GOT HIT SO, PLUS I HAVEN'T
WATCHED A MOVIE IN A VERY, VERY

23:52.517 --> 23:57.826
LONG TIME SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
AN ADVANCED SCREENING OF DEAR

23:57.862 --> 24:00.205
EVAN HAND SENSE-- HANSEN.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.826
>> FRENCHIE DID NOT HAVE A BLACK
EYE IN THAT, SO MAYBE THAT IS

24:02.862 --> 24:04.103
RIGHT AFTER.

24:04.136 --> 24:07.205
>> I'M FOCUSING ON A COUPLE OF
ALMOSTS THAT APPEAR IN MULTIPLE

24:07.240 --> 24:11.034
PHOTOS BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IS A
GREAT REFERENCE, FOR EXAMPLE

24:11.067 --> 24:14.895
WITH THE OR RANGE FRAME AND
BLACK FRAME I'M PRETTY SURE I

24:14.931 --> 24:18.758
HAVE THEM WRONG BECAUSE IN ONE
DEREK X'S APPLE HAS ONE MORE

24:18.792 --> 24:22.136
BITE THAN IN THE OTHER PHOTO SO
I GOT TO SWITCH THEM AROUND.

24:22.172 --> 24:25.550
I'M PRETTY SHIRE I HAVE THE
SEQUENCE OF THESE PHOTOS DOWN

24:25.586 --> 24:26.344
PAT.

24:26.378 --> 24:30.000
SO I AM GOING TO PRESS THE
BUTTON.

24:30.034 --> 24:33.378
OH, I GOT IT.

24:33.413 --> 24:33.964
WHOOO.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.826
YES.

24:34.862 --> 24:36.448
>> I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS
COMP.

24:36.481 --> 24:39.413
SO I AM HOPING FOR THE BEST.

24:39.448 --> 24:46.862
>> BB HIGH SCHOOL.

24:46.895 --> 24:49.862
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHO
THE TARGET IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

24:49.895 --> 24:51.067
ANONYMOUS H.O.H.

24:51.103 --> 24:54.103
SO THE PERSON WHO PUT ME AND
KYLAND UP COULD WANT ME DPON.

24:54.136 --> 24:55.378
I DON'T KNOW.

24:55.413 --> 24:58.136
SO I'M REALLY HOPING THAT I CAN
WIN THIS VETO COMPETITION T IS

24:58.172 --> 25:04.481
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO ENSURE
THAT I WILL BE SAFE THIS WEEK.

25:04.517 --> 25:07.689
>> I FEEL LIKE IF I JUST PUT ALL
OF THE PICTURES OUT I'M JUST

25:07.723 --> 25:11.205
GOING TO GET CONFUSED AND
OVERWHELMED BY ALL OF THE

25:11.240 --> 25:14.550
DIFFERENT STORY LINES THAT ARE
GOING TO BE PRESENTEE IN THE

25:14.586 --> 25:15.862
PHOTO.

25:15.895 --> 25:17.758
MY STRATEGY IS TO ORGANIZE THEM
AS I PULL THEM OUT OF THE POKS.

25:17.792 --> 25:23.517
I DO THAT UNTIL ALL OF THEM ARE
ON THE BOARD.

25:23.550 --> 25:29.481
>> OKAY.

25:29.517 --> 25:30.723
NOPE, NOPE.

25:30.758 --> 25:34.758
>> I NOTICE THE PHOTOS OF THE
TARANTULA IN THE CAGE HAVE TO

25:34.792 --> 25:37.275
COME BEFORE THE PHOTOS WITH THE
TARANTULA OUT OF THE CAGE.

25:37.309 --> 25:47.344
SO I NEED TO REARRANGE THOSE AND
PRESS THE BUTTON.

25:47.344 --> 25:55.964
SO I NEED TO REARRANGE THOSE AND
PRESS THE BUTTON.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.413
>> REALLY?

25:59.448 --> 26:01.034
OKAY.

26:01.067 --> 26:02.931
OH, I HOPE THAT WAS ENOUGH.

26:02.964 --> 26:05.586
I DO THINK THAT I WENT PRETTY
FAST.

26:05.619 --> 26:10.034
I JUST REALLY HOPE THAT THAT WAS
FAST ENOUGH TO WIN THE POWER OF

26:10.067 --> 26:11.344
VETO AND SIEF MYSELF.

26:20.758 --> 26:23.689
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HOW
EVERYBODY DID IN TODAY'S VETO

26:23.723 --> 26:24.586
COMPETITION.

26:24.619 --> 26:33.103
KYLAND YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME
OF 5:25.

26:33.136 --> 26:39.378
>> CLAIRE, YOU FINISHED WITH A
TIME OF 6:27.

26:39.413 --> 26:42.034
>> NICE JOB, CLAIRE.

26:42.067 --> 26:46.758
WHY TO GET IT T I COULD LAND,
ARE YOU STILL IN THE LEAD.

26:46.792 --> 26:54.413
ALYSSA, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
BEAT KYLAND'S TIME OF 5:25.

26:54.448 --> 27:00.240
YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF
8:14.

27:00.275 --> 27:05.862
>> ALL RIGHT, HANNAH, LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN BEAT KYLAND'S TIME OF

27:05.895 --> 27:07.067
5:25.

27:07.103 --> 27:15.413
YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF 4:59
>> THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WON

27:15.448 --> 27:16.275
THOUGH.

27:16.309 --> 27:17.344
>> GOOD JOB, HANNAH.

27:17.378 --> 27:18.344
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

27:18.378 --> 27:19.448
>> THANK YOU.

27:19.481 --> 27:24.172
>> ALL RIGHT, HANNAH, YOU ARE
CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD.

27:24.205 --> 27:31.862
X-ZAVIER, YOU FINISHED WITH A
TIME OF 8:29.

27:31.895 --> 27:35.378
ALL RIGHT, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
THIS.

27:35.413 --> 27:40.067
EITHER HANNAH OR SARAH BETH WILL
GET THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

27:40.103 --> 27:43.136
>> HANNAH'S TIME IS REALLY FAST
BUT I KNOW I WHEN AS FAST AS I

27:43.172 --> 27:46.172
POSSIBLY COULD SO I'M HOPING
THAT I WILL WIN THE POWER OF

27:46.205 --> 27:48.309
VETO AND TAKE MYSELF OFF THE
BLOCK.

27:48.344 --> 27:52.240
>> OKAY, SARAH BETH, LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN BEAT HANNAH'S TIME OF

27:52.275 --> 27:53.034
4:5 THE.

27:53.067 --> 28:02.275
YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF
5:22.

28:02.309 --> 28:04.689
THAT MEANS HANNAH,
CONGRATULATIONS.

28:04.723 --> 28:08.792
YOU WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO!

28:08.826 --> 28:10.862
>> OH MY GOD.

28:10.895 --> 28:13.413
OH MY GOD!

28:13.448 --> 28:14.862
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

28:14.895 --> 28:18.862
>> THANK YOU.

28:18.895 --> 28:25.344
>> I WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO AND I AM SO, SO, SO, SO

28:25.378 --> 28:26.586
EXCITED.

28:26.619 --> 28:29.723
I AM THINKING ABOUT USING THIS
POWER OF VETO TO PULL X-ZAVIER

28:29.758 --> 28:31.000
OFF THE BLOCK.

28:31.034 --> 28:34.826
AND ON TOP OF THAT I GET TO SEE
AN ADVANCED SCREENING OF DEAR

28:34.862 --> 28:36.964
EVAN HANSEN, MI SO HAPPY RIGHT
NOW.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.275
>> I AM SAD I LOST.

28:38.309 --> 28:41.481
AND EVEN MORE SAD THAT SARAH
BETH LOST.

28:41.517 --> 28:45.275
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS CRUSHES
HER.

28:45.309 --> 28:46.826
AND IT SUCKS.

28:46.862 --> 28:48.550
>> AMAZING JOB.

28:48.586 --> 28:52.205
>> IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT I
DIDN'T WIN THE VETO BECAUSE I

28:52.240 --> 28:56.413
WAS KIND OF CONTEMPLATING DOING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

28:56.448 --> 28:57.723
TIFF INITIALLY WANTED.

28:57.758 --> 29:00.862
BUT LET'S GET SARAH BETH OUT
THIS WEEK AND THEN REGROUP AND

29:00.895 --> 29:10.275
REFOCUS AN KEEP MOVING FORWARD
IN THIS GAME.

29:10.309 --> 29:11.309
>> .

29:11.344 --> 29:14.378
I REALLY FELT LIKE HI DONE MY
BEST.

29:14.413 --> 29:18.000
I KNOW I COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY
BETTER.

29:18.034 --> 29:31.550
SO I WAS JUST REALLY HOPING THAT
IT WOULD BE ENOUGH.

29:31.586 --> 29:41.862
>> TO IT BE SO CLOSE.

29:41.895 --> 29:46.826
>> YOU'RE SO SMART.

29:46.862 --> 29:50.826
>> WASN'T ENOUGH.

29:50.862 --> 29:56.205
>> .

29:56.240 --> 30:02.826
>> WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT.

30:02.862 --> 30:14.931
>> QUNS HANNAH WON VETO, I'M
HAPPY FOR HER.

30:14.964 --> 30:17.826
I AM SAD THAT I DIDN'T WIN
BECAUSE I'M COMPETITIVE AND I

30:17.862 --> 30:22.792
WOULD HAVE LOVED TO PULL MYSELF
OFF THE BLOCK EVEN THOUGH I FEEL

30:22.826 --> 30:28.378
BEYOND CONFIDENT, IT IS MUCH
MORE LIKE I DON'T LOVE IT ON MY

30:28.413 --> 30:34.792
RESUME TO BE ON THE BLOCK ON
EVICTION DAY, I DON'T WANT TO

30:34.826 --> 30:38.792
PACK MY BAG.

30:38.826 --> 30:42.758
>> ARE YOU RIGHT, THAT MAKES
SENSE.

30:42.792 --> 30:46.654
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS REALLY
ANY CHANCE I CAN CONVINCE HER TO

30:46.689 --> 30:48.205
USE IT ON ME.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.205
SO MAYBE WE CAN CONVINCE HER TO
TAKE KYLAND OFF THE BLOCK.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.240
AS LONG AS IT IS NOT JUST ME AND
KYLAND ON THE BLOCK, WE HAVE A

30:56.275 --> 31:01.034
CHANCE TO CAMPAIGN FOR OURSELVE
BECAUSE X-ZAVIER COULD STILL BE

31:01.067 --> 31:02.826
THE ONE GOING HOME.

31:02.862 --> 31:07.034
>> I WANTED WANTED IT IT SO BAD.

31:07.067 --> 31:08.895
>> YOU WERE SO CLOSE.

31:08.931 --> 31:10.862
S' NOT ENOUGH FOR RIGHT NOW

31:21.136 --> 31:28.205
>> HEY EVERYBODY, PLEASE GATHER
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.654
>> BECAUSE I WON THE VETO
COMPETITION I HAVE THE

31:30.689 --> 31:34.067
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THREE
HOUSEGUESTS TO DOM WITH ME TO

31:34.103 --> 31:36.136

31:59.619 --> 32:02.275

32:09.517 --> 32:11.448

32:11.481 --> 32:15.067

>> FOR THE VETO.

34:40.965 --> 34:45.793
>> KYLAND IS PROBABLY GUESSING
THAT I AM THE H.O.H. BUT I'M

34:45.827 --> 34:50.516
NEVER GOING TO TELL HIM THAT.

34:50.550 --> 34:54.688
>> I THINK THAT KYLAND WANTS THE
VETO TO BE USED ON HIM SO THAT

34:54.724 --> 34:59.034
HE HAS SOME WAY TO SAVE SARAH
BETH THIS WEEK.

34:59.068 --> 35:06.757
THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR HIM.

35:06.793 --> 35:18.793
>> WITHIN WILL YOU HAND ME MY
SARAPE.

35:18.827 --> 35:19.757
>> YEAH.

35:19.793 --> 35:22.447
>> THANK YOU.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.757
>> OH, WAY TO GET ON MY NERVES.

35:37.793 --> 35:46.724
>> KYLAND, YOU TOLD ME TO PUT
YOU UP NEXT TO SARAH BETH.

35:46.757 --> 35:54.688
NOW YOU'RE ASKING TO COME DOWN.

35:54.724 --> 35:56.240
NO, SHUT [BLEEP]-- KYLAND.

35:56.275 --> 35:59.275
>> I WILL SEE NEW A LITTLE BIT.

35:59.309 --> 36:02.585
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THE PLAN
IS.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.585
PICK A PARTNER AND SIT NEXT TO
THEM.

36:04.619 --> 36:07.481
YOU DO IT EVERY MORNING, EVERY
AFTERNOON, EVERY MIDNIGHTMENT

36:07.516 --> 36:11.965
ARE YOU ABOUTING TO SIT YOUR ON
THAT BLOCK, KYLAND AND SHUT UP

36:12.000 --> 36:12.585
ABOUT IT.

36:48.619 --> 36:51.000
>> THAT'S THE CHICKEN THAT YOU
MADE EARLIER TODAY.

36:51.034 --> 36:51.309
>> UH-HUH.

36:51.344 --> 36:51.827
>> NICE.

36:51.862 --> 36:53.103
>> FROM LAST NIGHT.

36:53.137 --> 36:55.034
>> UH-HUH.

36:55.068 --> 36:56.240
>> OH.

36:56.275 --> 37:00.447
>> DESPITE KNOWING I WILL BE
SAFE STAYING ON THE BLOCK, IT

37:00.481 --> 37:03.793
MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR
MY GAME TO COME DOWN BEFORE

37:03.827 --> 37:05.068
EVICTION NIGHT.

37:05.103 --> 37:09.206
SO I WANT TO TALK TO-- TO FIND
OUT WHAT HE IS THINKING IN TERMS

37:09.240 --> 37:15.655
OF THE VETO AND LONG-TERM IN THE
GAME.

37:15.688 --> 37:22.103
>> I WANTED TO SEE ABOUT YOU
USING THE VETO ON ME.

37:22.137 --> 37:23.965
>> WAIT, I'M CONFUSED.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.068
>> YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE
YOU HAD SOME SORT OF POWER, YOU

37:27.103 --> 37:30.275
GET THE CHOICE ON WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO FOR YOUR PERSONAL GAME AS

37:30.309 --> 37:35.688
LONG AS IT IS NOT A DETRIMENT TO
THE SIX.

37:35.724 --> 37:41.103
>> THE PLAN FOR ME HAS ALWAYS
BEEN TO USE THE VETO ON X BUT

37:41.137 --> 37:45.965
NOW KYLAND IS PITCHING THAT I
USE THE POWER OF VETO ON HIM AND

37:46.000 --> 37:48.793
I CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT
HIS ANGLE IS HERE.

37:48.827 --> 37:53.103
>> I FELL LIKE WE'RE IN THAT
SITUATION NOW TO WHERE YOU CAN

37:53.137 --> 37:58.724
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, AND EITHER
WAY IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A

37:58.757 --> 37:59.965
DETRIMENT TO THE-- NECESSARILY.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.793
>> WHEN WE MADE THE MASTER PLAN,
WE THREE, WEEK THREE WE ALL

38:03.827 --> 38:06.827
AGREED WE WOULD BE WILLING TO
SIT NEXT TO OUR PESH WHEN IT

38:06.862 --> 38:08.344
DOMES TIME FOR OUR PERSON TO GET
EVICTED.

38:08.378 --> 38:12.724
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY KYLAND
ISN'T ACCEPTING THAT.

38:12.757 --> 38:17.516
>> RIGHT NOW IF F IS UNANIMOUS
VOTE, IF I COME OFF, SHE WOULD

38:17.550 --> 38:28.344
HAVE ONE VOTE AND I FEEL THAT
FOR ME PERSONALLY, I THINK THAT

38:28.378 --> 38:36.206
WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING IN
TERMS OF HOPELESSNESS.

38:36.240 --> 38:41.137
>> SHE WOULDN'T-- IT IS NOT
ABOUT-- LITERALLY, IF IT ST SHE

38:41.172 --> 38:46.827
IS THERE, SHE WOULD FEEL BETTER
ULTIMATELY.

38:46.862 --> 38:47.550
>> IF YOU CAME DOWN.

38:47.585 --> 38:49.103
>> IF I CAME DOWN.

38:49.137 --> 38:52.000
>> WHAT IS KYLAND A ULTERIOR
MOTIVE.

38:52.034 --> 38:55.034
YOU WANT TO COME OFF THE BLOCK
JUST SO YOU CAN THROW SOMEONE A

38:55.068 --> 38:55.827
SYMPATHY VOTE.

38:55.862 --> 38:58.137
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AT
ALL.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.896
I THINK HIS ANGLE IS THAT HE
WANTS TO COME DOWN SO THAT HE

39:00.931 --> 39:04.172
CAN FLIP THE TARGET OFF OF SB.

39:04.206 --> 39:08.862
HE TRIES TO ACT LIKE A TEAM
PLAYER, LIKE EVERYTHING THAT HE

39:08.896 --> 39:16.827
DOES IS FOR THE-- BUT KYLAND IS
PLAYING FOR KYLAND.

39:16.862 --> 39:22.000
>> .

39:22.000 --> 39:26.862
>> .

39:43.344 --> 39:57.068
WITHIN HEY HOUSEGUESTS
IT'S TIME FOR THE VETO MEETING.

39:57.103 --> 40:00.344
>> THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:00.378 --> 40:04.309
KYLAND, SARAH BETH AND X-ZAVIER
HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR EVICTION

40:04.344 --> 40:07.240
BUT I HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE
OF THE NOMINATION.

40:07.275 --> 40:17.309
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON X-ZAVIER.

40:17.309 --> 40:23.103
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON X-ZAVIER.

40:23.137 --> 40:25.965
BECAUSE X-ZAVIER WAS PUT ON THE
BLOCK BECAUSE OF A PUNISHMENT

40:26.000 --> 40:36.619
AND NOT A NOMINATION, THERE WILL
BE NO REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

40:46.724 --> 40:50.688
>> SORRY KYLAND BUT IN NO
UNIVERSE WAS I EVER GOING TO USE

40:50.724 --> 40:53.757
THE VETO ON YOU, THE FACT THAT
YOU EVEN ASKED ME TO PULL YOU

40:53.793 --> 40:55.137
DOWN IS SUPER SKETCHY.

40:55.172 --> 41:02.240
I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME WITH SKETCH B.

41:02.275 --> 41:03.447

TO BE MADE.

AND IT SUCKS.

41:14.757 --> 41:17.585
>> IT SUCKS TOK ON THE BLOCK
NEXT TO KYLAND, BUT ULTIMATELY I

41:17.619 --> 41:20.068
DIDN'T COME HERE TO HANG OUT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.862
I CAME HERE TO WIN A GAME.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.862
AND I AM DEFINITELY NOT TRYING
TO LEAVE BEFORE HE DOES.

41:25.896 --> 41:32.137

TO DO TO MAKE SURE I STAY.

41:32.172 --> 41:34.309
>> KYLAND, TRYING TO HAVE THE
POWER OF VETO USED ON YOU THIS

41:34.344 --> 41:37.309
