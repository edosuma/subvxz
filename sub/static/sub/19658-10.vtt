WEBVTT

00:02.154 --> 00:03.250
Hang in there, mutt.

00:03.344 --> 00:05.760
I can't exactly duct tape
this thing shut.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.823
<i>Cosmo cannot keep</i>

00:08.016 --> 00:10.336
<i>Cocoon closed either.</i>

00:10.456 --> 00:13.718
<i>Rocket must flee! Go!</i>

00:14.333 --> 00:16.585
Rocket! You opened the Cocoon?

00:16.638 --> 00:18.862
That's what we've been
trying to stop from happening!

00:19.069 --> 00:20.828
<i>Rocket not open Cocoon.</i>

00:20.955 --> 00:23.365
<i>And Cosmo cannot
stop it opening.</i>

00:23.611 --> 00:25.438
Cosmo, you can talk again!

00:25.488 --> 00:27.640
Wait. Is it still talking
if your mouth doesn't move?

00:27.802 --> 00:29.177
Drax, we can't let whatever's

00:29.217 --> 00:31.623
in that thing destroy
the universe.

00:38.275 --> 00:40.349
I cannot reach it, Gamora.

00:40.486 --> 00:42.412
Then we gotta
teleport it outta here.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.550
- Groot, gimme a bridge.
- I am Groot!

00:54.032 --> 00:55.994
If this thing wants
to destroy the universe,

00:56.090 --> 00:58.267
it can do it on
the other side of a black hole.

01:07.159 --> 01:10.114
Wait. Is that... a baby?

01:17.644 --> 01:19.884
Quill, what do you think
you're doing?

01:26.706 --> 01:29.014
Huh?

01:36.310 --> 01:37.651
Put it back, Quill.

01:37.726 --> 01:40.015
That thing could destroy
the entire universe.

01:40.088 --> 01:43.341
Ha! How exactly is this
burp machine gonna do that?

01:43.468 --> 01:47.003
Even I could not destroy
an entire universe at that age.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.458
<i>Cosmo tried
to read child's mind.</i>

01:50.581 --> 01:54.126
<i>Only one word... "Warlock."</i>

01:54.186 --> 01:58.616
Warlock was the one being my father
Thanos feared in all the universe.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.664
I am Groot.

02:01.042 --> 02:03.303
Really? 'Cause according
to Groot here,

02:03.378 --> 02:06.421
Warlock was the savior
of his entire race.

02:06.517 --> 02:09.768
To my people, Warlock
brought only destruction.

02:09.859 --> 02:12.226
That is why we must have
our own destroyer.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.724
You're not destroying
this Warlock.

02:14.838 --> 02:16.704
I would never destroy
a mere child.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.006
<i>Guardians must
be debating later.</i>

02:19.089 --> 02:22.031
<i>Cosmo senses more Believers
that want to take baby.</i>

02:22.218 --> 02:25.526
Okay. Cosmo, lock the Continuum
Cortex onto the <i> Milano.</i>

02:25.706 --> 02:27.361
We're getting outta here, now.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.746
The Warlock lives again!

02:34.917 --> 02:37.451
Give us the child now,
unbelievers.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.484
You won't take him from me!

02:39.631 --> 02:41.973
I believe we will.

02:54.611 --> 02:57.171
Give us the Warlock, now!

02:57.888 --> 02:59.022
Never!

03:02.682 --> 03:04.491
Cutting it close,
aren't we?

03:04.589 --> 03:06.390
Not close enough for my taste.

03:08.386 --> 03:10.974
Whoa. Nice trick, kiddo.

03:11.683 --> 03:12.835
Huh?

03:22.307 --> 03:23.906
Bummer for you guys.

03:29.572 --> 03:32.782
Oh, great Warlock,
we are your humble servants,

03:32.860 --> 03:35.662
ready to help you
usher in the Golden Age.

03:38.250 --> 03:41.200
Yeah, okay. All this baby
worship is just weirding me out.

03:41.693 --> 03:44.719
I am Groot. I am Groot.

03:44.771 --> 03:47.320
I am Groot, I am Groot.

03:48.774 --> 03:50.531
At least the tyke's on our side.

03:50.625 --> 03:51.906
We can't assume that.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.579
He absorbed
the Believers' weapons,

03:53.603 --> 03:56.010
but he could just as easily
have taken ours,

03:56.109 --> 03:58.216
or pulled us inside
that gem again.

03:58.307 --> 04:00.284
<i>Cosmo hears you, but also hears</i>

04:00.343 --> 04:03.996
<i>thoughts of more
Guardians must hurry!</i>

04:10.159 --> 04:11.333
No!

04:19.320 --> 04:21.040
I ain't ready to be
no babysitter!

04:21.560 --> 04:22.677
Not it!

04:22.826 --> 04:23.826
Rocket!

04:24.241 --> 04:25.260
Ugh!

04:25.348 --> 04:27.147
What exactly does it do?

04:27.254 --> 04:30.553
He's a baby, Gamora.
He doesn't do anything.

04:30.673 --> 04:33.787
That is untrue.
Babies eat, sleep, and...

04:33.977 --> 04:35.645
that thing that happens
after eating.

04:35.694 --> 04:37.608
Well, sounds like you have
things under control.

04:37.873 --> 04:39.575
Good luck.

04:40.857 --> 04:42.047
Oh, okay. Yeah.

04:42.072 --> 04:43.432
He probably just needs a nap.

04:43.512 --> 04:44.687
Now, where can we find...

04:44.774 --> 04:47.921
I am Groot.

04:52.372 --> 04:55.668
Eh, okay! That's what
I call a light sleeper.

04:55.961 --> 04:59.185
<i>Peter Quill, what did you do
with that Cocoon?</i>

04:59.349 --> 05:02.735
Hey-hey, Nova Prime!
Which Cocoon was that now?

05:02.995 --> 05:05.130
<i>The one all of Xandar
just saw you with</i>

05:05.195 --> 05:08.258
<i>before it opened up, and the
Believers' broadcast cut out.</i>

05:08.380 --> 05:09.848
I am Groot!
Oh, that Cocoon.

05:09.924 --> 05:12.419
There's good news.
Nothing was inside of it.

05:12.532 --> 05:13.812
<i>Then perhaps you can explain</i>

05:13.885 --> 05:15.414
<i>why the Nova Centurion helmet</i>

05:15.460 --> 05:17.413
<i>you gave us is going apoplectic.</i>

05:18.799 --> 05:19.974
Nope.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.160
<i>You know the helmet is
connected to the Cocoon, Quill.</i>

05:23.327 --> 05:26.644
<i>That's why I've sent a team
of star-blasters to intercept.</i>

05:26.796 --> 05:28.490
<i>So you will hand over to them</i>

05:28.542 --> 05:30.201
<i>whatever just
came out of that Cocoon,</i>

05:30.369 --> 05:34.075
<i>or they will tear
your ship apart bolt by bolt.</i>

05:34.308 --> 05:36.330
Uh, is there a third option,
by any chance?

05:38.910 --> 05:41.226
We've got Believers on our tail.

05:44.986 --> 05:47.055
We need more power
to the engines.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.717
I gave you all I got, so unless
you wanna wish real hard...

05:50.898 --> 05:53.281
Wish real hard...
Wish real hard...

05:53.442 --> 05:54.742
Wish real hard...

06:08.283 --> 06:11.076
Huh.

06:12.959 --> 06:14.736
Inmate Titus, freeze!

06:15.849 --> 06:17.782
Put the helmet down.

06:17.895 --> 06:20.242
Do you have any idea
what this is?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.745
No. Of course you don't.

06:22.859 --> 06:26.546
See, if you were an experienced
ex-corpsman like myself,

06:26.638 --> 06:29.145
you'd know the legends
surrounding this helmet.

06:29.251 --> 06:31.178
And if even half
of them are true,

06:31.332 --> 06:34.890
I could rule an entire system
with this alone.

06:49.912 --> 06:51.147
Titus!

06:51.370 --> 06:53.186
Nova Prime.
I always thought

06:53.296 --> 06:55.959
you made up those stories
about the Centurion helmets

06:56.031 --> 06:58.114
and the original
Knights of the Nova Corps.

07:01.857 --> 07:04.085
The all-powerful Warlock?

07:04.225 --> 07:07.073
In the hands of those
undeserving scum!

07:07.193 --> 07:10.006
You may not know it yet,
Guardians...

07:10.925 --> 07:13.754
but Titus has a score to settle!

07:22.049 --> 07:24.286
- Where the krutack are we?
- I don't know.

07:24.359 --> 07:27.618
That energy surge shot us
halfway across the Galaxy.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.229
And one guess
where it came from.

07:32.834 --> 07:35.039
- Thanks for the save, little...
- Whoa!

07:39.034 --> 07:40.867
All right.
Well, guess we're gonna

07:40.913 --> 07:43.200
have to start saving for
college sooner than I thought.

07:43.386 --> 07:46.952
It would appear that Warlock has
an accelerated aging process.

07:48.323 --> 07:51.144
That's not all that's
accelerated.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.112
Hey, no drooling on my stuff!

07:54.665 --> 07:55.718
Hmm.

07:55.858 --> 07:58.491
So, ya like duct tape, do ya?

07:59.177 --> 08:00.963
Uck cape.

08:02.209 --> 08:03.745
That's right.

08:04.218 --> 08:07.026
Now, why don't you be a good
little all-powerful cosmic being

08:07.098 --> 08:10.183
and whip me up about
300 more rolls of this stuff?

08:12.411 --> 08:14.168
Uck cape.

08:14.348 --> 08:16.647
Hey, give it back,
ya no-good brat.

08:23.374 --> 08:24.937
No!

08:25.812 --> 08:28.345
No, no, no, no, no-no, no, no!

08:30.933 --> 08:33.200
No. No, no, no, no, don't do that.
No... Don't...

08:42.725 --> 08:46.644
Clearly the child requires a more
constructive form of destruction.

08:55.571 --> 08:57.892
Drax, what are you doing?

09:01.098 --> 09:03.004
Making fungus
and entrail pudding.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.118
A good chef cannot destroy
all of existence,

09:05.226 --> 09:07.467
for then he would have
nothing left to cook.

09:10.695 --> 09:12.062
Ugh! Let's clean you up

09:12.154 --> 09:14.977
before you destroy all of
existence with that stench.

09:15.490 --> 09:18.196
Mm. Needs more entrail.

09:20.215 --> 09:21.411
Come here!

09:21.483 --> 09:25.234
Thanos may have feared you, but
I don't, so stop fidgeting.

09:25.923 --> 09:27.209
I am Groot!

09:32.216 --> 09:33.536
I am Groot.

09:37.050 --> 09:39.136
Oh, stop it, both of you.

09:39.319 --> 09:42.755
He's not a genie or a monster
or a cosmic deity.

09:42.809 --> 09:44.403
He's just a kid, okay?

09:44.489 --> 09:46.113
So that's how
we're gonna treat him.

09:46.242 --> 09:47.948
Whee!

09:49.981 --> 09:51.975
Okay, how about a new game?

09:52.175 --> 09:55.325
What? Crayons? No way!

09:55.438 --> 09:59.948
Drawing with crayons is way more
fun than floating. You wanna try?

10:03.694 --> 10:05.588
Wow. Not what I had
in mind, but...

10:06.872 --> 10:08.478
I
ain't cleaning that!

10:08.568 --> 10:10.161
I've seen this before.

10:10.268 --> 10:12.642
When I wore
that Nova Centurion helmet.

10:12.687 --> 10:15.584
These warriors must be
the protectors of Warlock.

10:15.684 --> 10:18.012
Protectors or destroyers?

10:18.239 --> 10:19.572
He's got a point.

10:19.632 --> 10:22.804
You can't tell whether these guys
are attacking or defending Warlock.

10:23.736 --> 10:25.182
Whoa!

10:28.931 --> 10:30.253
I'm gonna go with attacking.

10:30.312 --> 10:31.410
Titus!

10:31.455 --> 10:34.255
Ain't you got a prison cell
to crawl back into?

10:34.297 --> 10:37.466
Hmm. I don't believe in destiny.

10:37.606 --> 10:41.336
When a Centurion helmet smashed into
my prison cell, that was just luck.

10:41.443 --> 10:43.122
When it led me to a cosmic being of

10:43.196 --> 10:46.384
immeasurable power,
that was just programming.

10:46.637 --> 10:48.050
But when I find the Warlock

10:48.115 --> 10:51.038
in the care of the so-called
heroes who imprisoned me,

10:51.245 --> 10:53.186
that is destiny.

11:10.846 --> 11:13.172
You can grow, but
you can't run from me.

11:13.337 --> 11:14.918
This helmet makes me immune

11:14.950 --> 11:17.278
to being pulled into the
prison in your little jewel.

11:17.324 --> 11:20.554
Let me go!
What do you want from me?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.784
I will train you,
and once I have,

11:23.847 --> 11:27.590
you will destroy Xandar
and the Nova Corps for me.

11:27.985 --> 11:30.636
- Why?
- Because they imprisoned me.

11:30.726 --> 11:31.746
Why?

11:31.799 --> 11:34.303
Just because I was taking
a little extra on the side.

11:34.363 --> 11:38.051
- Why?
- Because I said so!

11:41.402 --> 11:43.590
Stop staring at me.

11:43.762 --> 11:47.396
- Stop staring at me.
- And don't copy me either.

11:49.358 --> 11:50.846
Weapons training first.

11:50.986 --> 11:53.634
I'm sure you have something
useful in that gem.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.782
That's not a weapon!

11:58.948 --> 12:02.914
That's not a weapon.
That's not a weapon.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.304
You can't hurt me.

12:30.696 --> 12:32.789
<i>Give us back the kid, Titus!</i>

12:33.053 --> 12:35.086
Of all the people to find you,

12:35.133 --> 12:38.569
it had to be the most
annoying fools in the Galaxy.

12:38.639 --> 12:39.705
How?

12:42.910 --> 12:44.770
Friends come back for you.

12:44.836 --> 12:47.131
You'd know that if you had any.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.712
No!

13:05.493 --> 13:06.517
Huh?

13:06.542 --> 13:08.832
You know this ship
has a back door, right?

13:10.271 --> 13:12.557
Noooo!

13:14.733 --> 13:15.963
I am Groot!

13:18.114 --> 13:19.162
Huh?

13:26.903 --> 13:29.241
Will nothing remove this helmet?

13:31.070 --> 13:33.001
I am Groot!

13:37.943 --> 13:39.318
Groot!

13:39.850 --> 13:42.383
Nobody blasts my bud!

13:43.066 --> 13:44.066
Huh?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.437
I'm the one who blasts!

13:55.096 --> 13:56.876
Guess I showed him.

13:57.584 --> 14:00.359
Yeah. He doesn't look
real impressed.

14:05.488 --> 14:06.975
As a former space cop,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.387
you should know
to always bring backup.

14:10.506 --> 14:11.644
Huh?

14:21.297 --> 14:23.482
I have the ultimate backup.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.074
Destroy them.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.722
Make me.

14:32.260 --> 14:33.620
- Very well.
- Whoa!

14:33.960 --> 14:37.446
Do it,
or I destroy your friends.

14:44.213 --> 14:46.659
Blast them, now!

14:58.805 --> 15:00.148
All of them!

15:00.261 --> 15:01.802
Don't do it, Warlock!

15:01.922 --> 15:04.741
Shut up!
I'm losing patience, boy.

15:07.329 --> 15:08.682
Stop yelling at me, both of you!

15:08.756 --> 15:10.981
I don't have time
for your tantrums!

15:11.059 --> 15:12.434
Pull yourself together!

15:12.529 --> 15:13.982
No!

15:22.180 --> 15:23.898
I don't wanna do this!
I don't!

15:23.999 --> 15:25.869
You will do as you're told!

15:27.732 --> 15:30.164
Stop, all of you!

15:33.448 --> 15:36.612
He's not in control.
We have to stop this now.

15:36.822 --> 15:38.378
He's just a scared little kid.

15:38.445 --> 15:39.935
He doesn't wanna hurt anyone.

15:40.008 --> 15:42.008
Can you be certain of that?

15:49.733 --> 15:50.983
Finally!

15:55.369 --> 15:59.352
You... You're not supposed
to be able to hurt me.

15:59.517 --> 16:01.366
Your gem's gone dark,

16:01.519 --> 16:04.172
which means you're turning
into the force of pure evil

16:04.227 --> 16:06.919
this helmet was created
to destroy.

16:07.835 --> 16:10.899
You're fair game now, kid.

16:11.006 --> 16:14.911
That means you're
fair game too, kitty-cat.

16:18.140 --> 16:21.550
No! Noooo!

16:24.934 --> 16:27.510
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

16:27.676 --> 16:30.191
He was right.
Titus was right.

16:30.284 --> 16:34.301
I'm bad!
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

16:36.534 --> 16:37.840
I know you're trying to do

16:37.905 --> 16:39.790
the right thing, Quill,

16:39.855 --> 16:42.657
but I'm not going
back into that gem.

16:42.782 --> 16:44.734
None of us are!

17:28.303 --> 17:29.532
Titus was right.

17:29.612 --> 17:32.646
The Nova Centurions existed
to protect Warlock

17:32.733 --> 17:34.872
as long as he remained
a force of good,

17:34.992 --> 17:38.111
but would destroy him
if he ever turned evil.

17:38.338 --> 17:41.150
And this helmet says
he's evil now!

17:41.264 --> 17:44.097
Evil now...
Evil now...

17:44.184 --> 17:45.723
Evil now...

17:48.722 --> 17:50.076
I am Groot.

17:50.212 --> 17:52.072
That kid needs
a permanent time-out.

17:52.226 --> 17:54.185
I do not wish
to destroy a child.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.471
Even Thanos was a child once.

17:56.573 --> 17:57.844
If you met him then,

17:57.904 --> 18:01.266
knowing what you know now,
would you have hesitated?

18:01.768 --> 18:02.926
No.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.639
No one is hurting him
on my watch.

18:07.776 --> 18:11.265
No one is destroying the
universe on my watch, mister.

18:15.963 --> 18:19.494
Warlock, you need
to pull yourself together!

18:19.887 --> 18:23.458
Titus said I was bad, and the
things he made me do were bad,

18:23.538 --> 18:25.715
and now even the helmet
says I'm bad.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.403
No hat gets to decide
what you are.

18:28.576 --> 18:30.715
No one gets
to decide that but you.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.421
That's what being a Guardian
of the Galaxy is all about.

18:33.581 --> 18:36.875
I'm not a Guardian.
I can't be.

18:37.022 --> 18:39.422
- Why not?
- My dad's a dictator.

18:39.528 --> 18:41.878
I was raised by criminals,
trained to be a thief.

18:42.027 --> 18:44.605
But I'm a hero
because I choose to be.

18:44.731 --> 18:46.651
Drax was trained
to be a Gladiator.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.832
Rocket and Groot
were both thrown out.

18:48.915 --> 18:52.165
Gamora was raised by Thanos,
the most evil guy I've ever met.

18:52.248 --> 18:55.517
But she chose another way,
and you can too.

18:56.648 --> 18:58.656
We believe in you, Warlock.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.237
Don't we, guys?

19:10.015 --> 19:11.542
We believe in you, Warlock.

19:11.662 --> 19:13.205
We believe in you, Warlock.

19:13.408 --> 19:15.781
I am Groot.

19:15.934 --> 19:19.633
Aw! I wanted to shoot
a cosmic deity.

19:21.554 --> 19:22.635
Huh?

19:36.061 --> 19:38.951
Thank you. All of you.

19:40.702 --> 19:43.967
I'll never get used
to those growth spurts.

19:44.154 --> 19:46.820
Okay. Well, a new destiny
means a new name.

19:46.966 --> 19:50.727
From now on, I dub you...
Goody Two Shoes.

19:52.479 --> 19:53.798
Okay. All right. Okay.

19:53.864 --> 19:55.763
Lighten up with the Dark Gem

19:55.851 --> 19:57.767
How about the guy
who sang "Goody Two Shoes"?

19:57.861 --> 19:59.787
His name was Adam... something.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.106
Adam Warlock.

20:02.226 --> 20:03.472
I like it.

20:09.698 --> 20:11.738
Peter Quill, I am ordering you

20:11.798 --> 20:13.420
to return that Centurion helmet,

20:13.471 --> 20:15.553
or I will bring the full
force of the Nova

20:15.600 --> 20:17.632
Corps down on
your scruffy little head.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.827
It's caused
enough trouble already.

20:19.955 --> 20:22.393
That's because it's broken.
It must've been damaged

20:22.493 --> 20:24.769
by something very powerful.

20:24.879 --> 20:26.858
There's no cause for alarm,
Nova Prime.

20:26.952 --> 20:28.602
The helmet is fine now.

20:28.684 --> 20:30.913
It's going off
to find its true purpose.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.032
And I must do the same.

20:33.205 --> 20:34.967
Thank you all for helping me,

20:35.039 --> 20:38.168
but the next part of my journey
I must take alone.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.841
However, before I go...

20:43.049 --> 20:45.668
Well, it's good to put things
back where you found them.

20:45.835 --> 20:47.268
Best of luck on your journey.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.504
Don't fall in no black holes.

20:49.592 --> 20:51.780
I am Groot.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.501
Whatever I was in another life,

20:53.547 --> 20:56.014
I am not the savior
of your people in this one.

20:56.107 --> 20:59.024
But you can be.

20:59.111 --> 21:01.803
After all, you are Groot.

21:04.958 --> 21:06.695
So the Warlock has returned.

21:06.762 --> 21:09.350
The entire Galaxy will need
to be put on high alert.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.696
Nah. Relax, N.P.
Adam's a good kid.

21:11.742 --> 21:13.840
He's ridding the Galaxy
of evil dudes like Titus.

21:14.027 --> 21:16.266
Although storing someone
inside yourself

21:16.340 --> 21:19.019
and getting rid of them
aren't exactly the same thing.

21:19.155 --> 21:22.357
Nevertheless, it is a good start
on the path to righteousness.

21:22.497 --> 21:25.372
Wait. That kid's
still got my duct tape!

21:25.526 --> 21:28.182
Get back here, you little
thievin' tape-napper!

21:28.207 --> 21:29.451
You ain't binding the universe

21:29.504 --> 21:31.942
together with my stash,
ya hear me?
