WEBVTT

00:16.683 --> 00:18.852
Ladies and gentlemen…

00:19.978 --> 00:21.896
…you’ve been waiting a long time,

00:22.731 --> 00:24.315
but we're finally here.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.945
Dojos from all across the Valley

00:29.029 --> 00:32.449
have been training for a year
for their shot at glory.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.658
You ready to meet 'em?

00:34.909 --> 00:35.869
You?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.662
You?

00:39.622 --> 00:41.499
All right.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.879
<i>This sensei and dojo need no introduction.</i>

00:45.962 --> 00:50.508
<i>He took the All Valley by storm</i>
<i>in 1984 and '85</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:53.845
<i>and quickly became</i>
<i>one of the greatest underdogs</i>

00:53.928 --> 00:55.513
<i>in the history of the sport.</i>

00:56.306 --> 01:01.352
<i>Last year, this dojo came out of nowhere</i>
<i>and made it to the finals.</i>

01:01.978 --> 01:06.066
<i>They've got some new fighters,</i>
<i>and they’re ready to show the world</i>

01:06.149 --> 01:07.859
<i>that they’re the best around.</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:11.696
Give it up for Miyagi-Do Karate,

01:12.238 --> 01:14.991
<i>led by two-time All Valley champion</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.910
<i>Daniel LaRusso!</i>

01:23.291 --> 01:24.501
Woo!

01:29.756 --> 01:30.632
Woo!

01:33.885 --> 01:36.930
This next dojo
took last year’s title.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.934
<i>But they’re under new management.</i>

01:42.143 --> 01:44.104
<i>Can they reign supreme once more?</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:46.689
<i>And last year’s runner-up.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:48.608
<i>He may be wearing a new gi,</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:50.735
<i>but one thing’s for sure,</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:53.905
<i>Robby Keene and his team</i>
<i>are ready to strike!</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:58.576
<i>Hailing from Reseda, defending champions</i>

01:58.660 --> 02:02.205
and still the most badass name for a dojo,

02:02.288 --> 02:06.000
<i>here comes Cobra Kai!</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:21.891
And finally…

02:23.268 --> 02:26.521
<i>this dojo is making</i>
<i>their All Valley debut,</i>

02:26.604 --> 02:29.774
<i>though you’ll recognize</i>
<i>a few familiar faces.</i>

02:29.858 --> 02:34.279
<i>Every year, a new dojo rises up the ranks.</i>

02:35.113 --> 02:38.158
<i>Does this newcomer</i>
<i>have what it takes to win it all?</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:41.536
Please welcome Eagle Fang Karate,

02:41.619 --> 02:44.164
<i>led by Sensei Johnny Lawrence</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:48.126
<i>and defending champion Miguel Diaz!</i>

03:06.352 --> 03:10.315
At the end of the day,
only one of these dojos

03:10.398 --> 03:12.901
can be crowned Grand Champion.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.444
Welcome

03:15.361 --> 03:21.868
to the 51st annual
All Valley Under-18 Karate Tournament!

03:28.833 --> 03:30.043
It's karate time.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.425
-Miyagi-Do's, bring it in.
-Eagle Fangs, listen up.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.554
Some of you have been here before…

03:41.638 --> 03:44.515
…and for some of you,
it's your first karate tournament.

03:45.099 --> 03:49.395
I still remember my first All Valley,
where I stood here proudly with my sensei.

03:49.479 --> 03:53.483
…where I pummeled the ever-loving crap out
of my opponents as the crowd cheered…

03:53.566 --> 03:56.361
…and where I faced down
the bullies of Cobra Kai.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.322
Now getting here hasn’t been easy.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.991
There've been some bumps in the road,
to put it mildly.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.577
They tried to soften you up.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.623
-That bullshit's behind us now.
-Remember what's at stake.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.960
If Cobra Kai wins,
our dojo closes for good.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.962
That means no more Eagle Fang.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.090
-We're not gonna let that happen, are we?
-No, Sensei!

04:17.173 --> 04:18.383
Of course not.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.052
Because we have something
that Cobra Kai doesn't…

04:21.135 --> 04:22.929
We have a reigning champion.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.973
We have Miyagi-Do.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.516
Let's get out there…

04:26.599 --> 04:28.685
…and show Cobra Kai what we're made of.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.186
Are you ready?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.229
Yes, Sensei.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.146
Are you ready?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.356
Yes, Sensei.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.066
All right, good. Let's warm up.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.610
Diaz, a word.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.075
Listen, I know
what's been going on with you lately.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.286
You do?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.913
You haven’t gotten over
that little spat with your girlfriend.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.125
-I can totally relate.
-Right.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.544
My junior prom was an absolute shit show.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.754
I need you to focus on winning.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.257
You and Sam will make up,
but she’s not on your team

04:59.340 --> 05:00.550
and your team needs you.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.178
Okay? Let's get to work.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.016
All right, fall in.

05:10.852 --> 05:14.022
All your training
has brought you to this moment.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.607
Remember, if you win,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.901
you don’t just get a trophy.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.528
You get the glory.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.573
And you get to know forever

05:24.907 --> 05:26.200
that you are a champion.

05:26.909 --> 05:31.164
I have had students with all the talent
in the world squander their moment.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.584
Do not let history repeat itself.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.589
Do not let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.799
And above all,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.510
do not let anything

05:45.219 --> 05:47.513
stand in the way of your victory.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.806
Just to be clear.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.725
That's not a pep talk.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.268
That's an order.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.355
And we're all gonna follow
Sensei Kreese's orders today, aren't we?

05:55.938 --> 05:58.024
-Yes, Sensei.
-Aren't we?

05:58.107 --> 05:59.233
Yes, Sensei!

05:59.317 --> 06:01.277
Let's go win this! Come on!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.071


06:03.154 --> 06:05.156


06:06.199 --> 06:09.577
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to begin our skills competition.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.037
Up first,

06:11.120 --> 06:14.248
Demetri Alexopoulos from Miyagi-Do Karate,

06:14.332 --> 06:16.584
who'll be showcasing the kamas.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.088
Hi-yah!

06:35.395 --> 06:36.229
Bow!

06:39.899 --> 06:41.234
Positions!

07:05.842 --> 07:07.677
Are you kidding me?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.971
What a way
to start the skills competition.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.433
Clearly, Miyagi-Do
and Eagle Fang came to play.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.853
But with such a tight spread,
it's still anyone's game.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.815
Baby, you got this!

07:25.736 --> 07:26.571
Let's go.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.530
Ais!

07:29.991 --> 07:31.701
-Ais!

07:35.037 --> 07:37.248
-Ais!

07:38.583 --> 07:41.502
Ais! Ais! Ais! Ais! Ais!

08:03.149 --> 08:04.192
Ais!

08:19.123 --> 08:20.291
Hi-yah!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.066
-Ais!

08:53.115 --> 08:55.618
Ais! Ais!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.787
Ais!

09:03.709 --> 09:06.754
And just like that,
Miyagi-Do has been snake bit

09:06.837 --> 09:11.217
as Cobra Kai takes the lead,
with our qualifier rounds up next.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.470
I can’t believe
Cobra Kai beat us in skills.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.514
I thought we had that in the bag.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.016
It’s my fault.
I couldn't break the last board. Sorry.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.394
Okay. Forget that, okay?
You all did great.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.646
We're on their heels.
This is far from over.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.398
How the hell are we in sixth place?

09:25.481 --> 09:29.068
The skills events are weighed differently.
Gold medals are ten points, silver--

09:29.151 --> 09:31.904
I don’t give a shit about the math.
What do we need to beat Cobra Kai?

09:32.697 --> 09:35.825
Uh, math. To catch up on points,

09:35.908 --> 09:39.161
we need to win as many matches
in the qualifying rounds as possible.

09:39.245 --> 09:43.082
The further we get, the tighter the vice
around Cobra Kai’s metaphorical balls.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.835
Okay. Good.
Now you're speaking my language.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.880
The thrill of skills.
I told you everyone would love it, Sue.

09:49.964 --> 09:54.552
Hey, I was always on board.
It's Ron who was standing in our way.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.846
He even botched up
the contract for the garage.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.015
I’m just gonna say
what we’re all thinking.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.684
This needs to be
his last go round as president.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.770
At the next meeting,
I’m calling for a vote of no confidence.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.232
What the hell is Ron doing on my mic?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.609
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:09.692 --> 10:13.654
the male and female division qualifiers
are about to begin.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.364
And with them,

10:15.448 --> 10:18.451
we enter a new era!

10:20.828 --> 10:26.626
That’s why we need a very special guest
to kick things off.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.086
Let’s give a big All Valley welcome

10:29.170 --> 10:34.884
to multi-Grammy-award winning,
international superstar,

10:34.967 --> 10:37.928
Carrie Underwood!

10:40.473 --> 10:41.682
Holy crap!

10:41.766 --> 10:43.809
Oh my God! Oh my God!

10:43.893 --> 10:45.645
That son of a bitch pulled it off.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.148
Hello, All Valley!

10:50.816 --> 10:53.110
I am so honored to be here.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.073
I didn't see a lot of karate
growing up in Oklahoma,

10:57.156 --> 11:00.534
but you guys know I love to compete,

11:01.118 --> 11:03.412
just like these wonderful young men

11:04.330 --> 11:05.665
and young women.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.875
-Woo!

11:07.958 --> 11:10.294
-Woo!
-Yeah!

11:10.378 --> 11:12.171
One thing I have learned

11:12.254 --> 11:17.051
is that everyone gets their shot,
their chance in the spotlight.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.845
Everyone gets their moment.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.597
This one's yours.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.451
Her husband's a client.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.372
I fixed a crown fracture
in his maxillary incisor.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.208
We never doubted you, Ron.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.263
Fight!

12:05.891 --> 12:07.685
-Winner!

12:28.998 --> 12:29.999
Point!

12:36.672 --> 12:37.631
Point!

12:43.429 --> 12:44.638
Fight!

13:05.743 --> 13:07.036
You got this, Bert!

13:13.209 --> 13:15.377
Let's go, All Valley!

13:18.672 --> 13:19.673
Winner!

13:22.301 --> 13:23.385
Winner!

13:26.722 --> 13:28.974
That's point! Winner!

13:32.186 --> 13:33.854
Point! Winner.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.318
-Point! Winner!
-Yeah!

13:58.587 --> 13:59.755
-Great news.
-What?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.675
Demetri won! That puts him
in the quarterfinals with me and Hawk.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.593
-Great.
-How are we doing here?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.053
We’re still in second overall.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.972
But we have three fighters still alive.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.266
We need one to advance,
and we can take the lead.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.309
Come on, Chris, you got this.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.021
All right, guys.
Score's two to two. Ready? Fight!

14:18.774 --> 14:21.026
-Ais. Ais.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.405
-Red side, point. Red side, winner.
-Fight!

14:30.119 --> 14:31.787
Point! Winner!

14:35.416 --> 14:36.876
Ready? Fight!

14:43.632 --> 14:45.092
Point! Winner!

14:49.013 --> 14:50.180
They know our moves.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
I wonder how.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.278
All right, folks.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.822
We’ve witnessed some great fighting today.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.325
But you ain't seen nothing yet.

15:10.034 --> 15:15.205
Because we have arrived
at the quarterfinals!

15:18.834 --> 15:22.546
Which means
things are about to get intense.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.052
Of the eight boys
and eight girls on this stage,

15:28.552 --> 15:32.056
one of each
will be named All Valley champion.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.434
And then we’ll tally all the points

15:35.517 --> 15:38.896
to determine
which dojo has earned the title

15:39.396 --> 15:40.940
of Grand Champion.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.568
And since the points get higher
in each round…

15:45.569 --> 15:47.279
…it’s still any dojo’s game!

15:47.363 --> 15:50.366
So you keep your eyes
on this here blue mat,

15:51.158 --> 15:55.204
because we are just getting started!

16:04.088 --> 16:05.506
-Point!
-Oh!

16:05.589 --> 16:06.465
Winner!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.764
Point!

16:15.349 --> 16:18.185
Come on, ref! She was out of bounds!
Where are your eyes?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.103
Fight!

16:24.608 --> 16:25.526
Ha!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.779
Point!Winner!

16:30.030 --> 16:34.118
<i>And with that,</i> <i>Eagle Fang's hopes</i>
<i>of winning Girls All Valley Champ</i>

16:34.201 --> 16:35.536
<i>have gone up in smoke.</i>

16:37.871 --> 16:40.124
It's all right. You did great today.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.835
I let her shut me out!
I should’ve focused on my low game.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.921
She’s been at this longer than you.
There's no reason to feel bad.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.340
Oh, I don’t feel bad.
I only trained for six weeks.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.301
I’m gonna be stomping all
of these weak ass bitches next year.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.846
So with you out,
do we even have a chance of winning?

16:53.929 --> 16:56.306
If the right female fighters
get eliminated

16:56.390 --> 16:58.809
and Miguel makes it to the final

16:59.601 --> 17:00.894
and he wins,

17:00.978 --> 17:04.398
then, technically, there's a chance.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.568
Good chance.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.701
You wanted to beat Miyagi-Do so badly
you gave Cobra Kai all of our secrets.

17:16.785 --> 17:17.953
The goal is to win.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.705
I did what I had to do.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.334
If all you care about is winning,
you didn’t learn anything I taught you.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.422
Everybody thinks
their way is the only way.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.592
You, my dad, Cobra Kai.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.596
Truth is, it doesn't matter
which way you fight as long as it works.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.682
And I'll use whatever it takes to win.

17:40.142 --> 17:40.976
Why?

17:41.518 --> 17:42.853
To get back at your dad?

17:43.520 --> 17:46.023
Me? Sam? The world?

17:46.732 --> 17:47.941
If that's the case,

17:48.025 --> 17:51.153
I have another Miyagi-Do secret
that you can slip to your friends.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.616
Never put passion in front of principle.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.409
Because even if you win,

17:58.994 --> 17:59.870
you lose.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.753
<i>Alexopoulos</i>
<i>has Robson on the ropes.</i>

18:07.836 --> 18:09.630
<i>Which of these fighters will advance?</i>

18:09.713 --> 18:12.382
<i>Miyagi-Do or All Star Karate?</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
-Point!
-Yeah! Demetri!

18:14.843 --> 18:16.053
Winner!

18:16.136 --> 18:19.681
<i>Newcomer Demetri Alexopoulos</i>
<i>is heading to the semis!</i>

18:20.974 --> 18:23.018
Your friend’s lucky
he didn’t face Cobra Kai.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.770
Can’t say the same for you though,

18:24.853 --> 18:26.105
Lip.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.526
Gonna make you kiss that mat.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.616
Ignore him. He's always been a bully,
but that's not who you are.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.703
I don't know who I am these days.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.041
You’re not defined
by your haircut, you know.

18:46.125 --> 18:50.129
I mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved it.
I was really digging the purple actually.

18:50.212 --> 18:54.591
ButI liked you
for your energy, your confidence.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.929
Yeah, well, I, uh, lost my confidence. So…

19:00.055 --> 19:00.889
Eli…

19:08.147 --> 19:12.109
<i>Next up in the quarterfinals,</i>
<i>it’s Kyler Park of Cobra Kai</i>

19:12.192 --> 19:14.987
<i>versus Eli Moskowitz of Miyagi-Do.</i>

19:16.488 --> 19:18.365
Looks like you've got a fight to win.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.585
-Everything good?
-Never better.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.129
I know who I am now.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.881
And who's that?

19:34.464 --> 19:36.592
The guy who’s gonna win
this fucking thing.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.767
To your marks. Face me.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.144
Bow.

19:47.769 --> 19:48.896
Bow to each other.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.855
Ready?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.481
And fight!

19:54.276 --> 19:56.069
-Point!

19:56.612 --> 19:57.487
Yes!

20:01.366 --> 20:02.743
Fight! Point!

20:03.493 --> 20:04.870
-Fight!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.373
Point!

20:08.999 --> 20:10.876
-Winner!

20:11.960 --> 20:13.420
Yeah, Eli!

20:13.503 --> 20:14.838
Woo!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.551
Mom, are you going to eat all of this?

20:19.635 --> 20:22.137
What can I say? I have the munchies.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.847
<i>Our next quarterfinal match</i>

20:23.931 --> 20:27.059
<i>will be Samantha LaRusso</i>
<i>of Miyagi-Do Karate</i>

20:27.142 --> 20:29.895
<i>versus Piper Elswith of Cobra Kai.</i>

20:30.938 --> 20:32.397
Face each other. Bow.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.566
You got this, Sam! Just like we practiced!

20:35.567 --> 20:36.401
Ready?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.528
And fight!

20:43.575 --> 20:44.743
Point!

20:45.369 --> 20:46.370
One-zero.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.081
Go, Piper! Go!

20:51.917 --> 20:54.211
Robby said Miyagi-Do was for defense only.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.964
And without your defense,
you have nothing.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.151
Ready?

21:19.861 --> 21:20.696
Fight!

21:28.161 --> 21:29.121
Point LaRusso!

21:40.424 --> 21:41.800
-Fight!

21:42.718 --> 21:44.052
Point LaRusso!

21:49.224 --> 21:51.268
-Point LaRusso!

21:51.351 --> 21:52.269
Yes!

21:52.978 --> 21:53.812
Winner!

22:05.991 --> 22:08.118
-What was that out there?
-Eagle Fang.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.912
That's what I thought.
How’d you pick up so much?

22:11.496 --> 22:12.706
Why does it matter? I won.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.124
You didn’t win the right way.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.169
Maybe my right way
is different than yours.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.087
Don't I get a choice?

22:25.510 --> 22:29.097
-I don't get why they're having us fight.
-Just the luck of the draw.

22:29.848 --> 22:30.974
No matter what happens,

22:31.058 --> 22:34.311
the fact that you made it this far
at your age is a huge deal.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.772
Your brother’s gonna be impressed.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.274
Well, I owe it all to you.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.109
You changed my whole life.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.820
But don't think
I'm going easy on you now, old man.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.781
Yeah, okay, wiseass.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.367
-See you out there.
-All right.

22:49.368 --> 22:53.538
<i>For our final quarterfinal match,</i>
<i>we have a real snake fight.</i>

22:53.622 --> 22:56.541
<i>It’s Cobra Kai versus Cobra Kai.</i>

22:57.125 --> 22:58.960
Face each other.Bow.

23:00.128 --> 23:00.962
Ready?

23:01.797 --> 23:02.923
And fight!

23:12.057 --> 23:12.933
Point!

23:14.976 --> 23:16.186
Time out.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.439
Go to your senseis.

23:24.194 --> 23:27.531
Are you fighting your friend
or your opponent?

23:28.698 --> 23:30.742
I thought you wanted to be a champion.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.371
Competitors, on your lines.

23:42.045 --> 23:42.879
Ready?

23:44.506 --> 23:45.632
And fight!

23:47.426 --> 23:48.718
-Point!

23:52.139 --> 23:53.223
On your marks.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.855
Fight!

24:10.240 --> 24:11.408
Fighters ready?

24:12.576 --> 24:13.410
Fight!

24:22.210 --> 24:23.170
No point. Continue.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.136
No point!

24:32.053 --> 24:33.138
Continue fighting.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.564
-Ooh!

24:43.648 --> 24:44.524
Winner!

24:47.027 --> 24:47.861
You all right?

24:53.283 --> 24:54.201
Face me.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.827
Bow. Go to your side.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.584
Just let him cool off.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.669
Robby, you good?

25:06.463 --> 25:07.297
Yeah.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.801
Well, if it isn’t Mr. Semifinal.

25:11.885 --> 25:15.597
Hey, Mr. LaRusso.
Looks like it's me and Eli in the semis.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.349
Yeah. Should be a good fight.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.559
I caught your last match.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.479
Couldn't help but notice
you circled your opponent.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.315
You didn't have us catching fish
for nothing.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.651
Diaz. It's time to get ready.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.237
All right. Bye, Mr. LaRusso.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.322
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.991
Softening Diaz up before our match?

25:35.075 --> 25:38.036
As if you haven’t gotten into Sam’s head
with all your Eagle crap.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.499
-You've been training her, haven't you?
-You should be thanking me.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.752
For turning Sam into someone
who can’t control her anger?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.796
Better than turning my champion
into a pussy

25:47.879 --> 25:49.798
who starts a fight and then runs away.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.676
I don't care what happens today.
Stay the hell away from Sam.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.636
Yeah. Stay the hell away from Miguel.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.556
<i>And now, our first semifinal match</i>

25:57.639 --> 26:02.143
<i>will be Miguel Diaz of Eagle Fang</i>
<i>versus Eli Moskowitz of Miyagi-Do.</i>

26:02.227 --> 26:05.814
All right. Don't forget to breathe
out there. How you feeling?

26:05.897 --> 26:08.984
I'm okay. Not exactly thrilled
to be fighting my friend.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.820
It doesn’t help
that nobody’s ever beaten Miguel either.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.906
Sorry, shouldn't have said that out loud.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.368
At least you know how he’ll fight.
Because Johnny taught you too.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.707
Listen, don't forget your blocks.
Stay patient. All right? You got this.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.417
All right, you can do this.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.336
You've beaten Hawk before.
Remember that killer instinct.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.171
-Take his ass out.
-What?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.757
Take his ass out? Hawk is my friend.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.010
He's fighting for LaRusso.
He picked his side.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.344
Whose side are you on?

26:37.387 --> 26:39.222
-Yours.
-Are you sure?

26:39.889 --> 26:42.767
Hawk may be your friend, but if you
wanna win this, you have to beat him.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.313
Whose side are you on?

26:47.314 --> 26:48.273
What do you mean?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.984
Gentlemen, take your positions.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.738
I'm on your side, Diaz. Always.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.452
Go, Diaz!

27:02.454 --> 27:05.206
Finally, a worthy opponent.
Not gonna hold back, right?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.500
-No.
-Good. Neither am I.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.962
On your marks.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.214
Face me. Bow.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.258
Face each other. Bow.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.219
-Ready?
-Ais!

27:22.015 --> 27:22.932
And fight!

27:32.025 --> 27:33.401
Go after him! Good, good!

27:34.986 --> 27:36.321
Nice, Diaz! Nice!

27:45.163 --> 27:47.248
No point, that's a block. Continue!

27:47.332 --> 27:49.084
Let's go, Diaz!

27:51.628 --> 27:53.088
<i>You're not a kid anymore.</i>

27:53.171 --> 27:55.799
<i>You want something, you're gonna</i>
<i>have to crawl across the floor.</i>

27:55.882 --> 27:57.634
Use your damn teeth if you have to.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.969
-<i>You can do this.</i>

28:01.513 --> 28:03.890
<i>I know you can.</i>
<i>I'm always gonna be here next to you.</i>

28:03.973 --> 28:06.393
-Yes!
<i>You’re gonna be my teacher?</i>

28:06.476 --> 28:08.812
No.I'm gonna be your sensei.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.356
<i>-Sensei.</i>

28:17.987 --> 28:19.197
Medic!

28:20.990 --> 28:22.075
Miggy.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.381
Sensei!
