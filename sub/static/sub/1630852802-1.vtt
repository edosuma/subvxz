So, we might need
the help of a doctor.

if you do some testing.

Not going to deny that.

There's a sense of me and
a piece of me that love him.

And, you know, there's loneliness
that creeps in when he's not around.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.519
So, I can't help but miss him.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.926
You know, I'm still staying in my strength
and, you know, loving who I am as a person.

10:27.928 --> 10:31.029

But he's been texting me.

are you kidding me?

10:41.375 --> 10:44.843
Empowered for me, I'm not
gonna let him take me down.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.880
I'm not gonna let him try to convince
me about something that shouldn't be.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.815
I don't even know
why he's texting me.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.885
He's just wanting to
get my attention of some sort.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.186
You're not going to go, are you?

10:56.689 --> 10:58.056
I don't know.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.959
Georgi's been texting me
and asking to see me.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.994
But I have to stay strong,

11:02.996 --> 11:07.265
<i>and not give in to
whatever he might say or do.</i>

11:07.267 --> 11:10.702
<i>That's the strength
I still have from Turkey.</i>

11:10.704 --> 11:14.406
And I still wanna
keep that alive.

11:16.509 --> 11:21.880
You say you're empowered. But it only works
if you allow yourself to be empowered.

11:21.882 --> 11:25.917
- You have to really live the words of empowerment.
- Absolutely.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.220
It's just a [bleep]
crazy ass pattern.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.495
We've all had patterns.
And I've had mine.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.798
And I had to break
some of those patterns.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.865
And it takes time and effort.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.235
You have to first
believe in yourself.

11:44.237 --> 11:49.274
You have to have the confidence
of yourself, and the love of yourself.

11:50.676 --> 11:53.712
So, all this other stuff that
you've done

11:53.714 --> 11:56.147
to make yourself
feel good about yourself.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.251
To make the ultimate change
in your life,

12:00.253 --> 12:01.853
it starts inside.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.388
I know that.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.862
We just want you happy
in a healthy relationship.

12:10.929 --> 12:12.330
Long term.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.033
- For once.
- [Stacey] For once.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.267
For once in your life.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.074
Wow!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.143
You look great, babe.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.913
- This is our model for the day.
- Hello.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.849
Her name is Ina.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.285
You didn't tell me you were doing
a photoshoot with another woman.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.926
How many times we've been on
the same freaking roller coaster?

12:41.928 --> 12:45.930
It's not right how he's just kind of
repeating patterns over and over again.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.265
This has got to stop.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.968
[Darcey] It's--
It's just a mess.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.045
[Stacey] Oh, how cute?

13:01.047 --> 13:03.214
Oh, and you did it
European style.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.016
Like our wedding day.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.451
That's so sweet of you.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.926
One year anniversary.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.028
Happy anniversary baby.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.963
Love you.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.932
What do you think of my outfit?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.101
Yeah.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.371
Oh, do you recognize something?

13:26.373 --> 13:29.007
My wedding shoe. I saved them.

13:29.842 --> 13:33.411
[sighs] You know what else we
should have saved? The wedding cake.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.147
On your first-year anniversary,
you supposed to eat it.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.483
We didn't really have
a wedding cake.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.020
Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.156
Now that we've put
the baby planning in the past.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.492
We wanna look forward
to the future.

13:47.494 --> 13:52.030
And what's next
is to plan a dream wedding.

13:52.631 --> 13:53.932
We got married in quarantine.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.568
And after everything
we've been through,

13:56.570 --> 13:59.871
Florian and I
deserve to celebrate.

13:59.873 --> 14:03.741
And renew our vows in front of
family and friends.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.711
Oh, I got something
for our anniversary, yes.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.379
One second stay right there.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.482
[singing] Ta-da! Here it is.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.119
Hand cast kit.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.021
You've never seen
one of these before?

14:17.023 --> 14:19.791
We put our hands together,
and it makes like a mold.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.193
It will get hard
and it will last for life.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.328
Like our marriage.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.565
So, for the first-year
anniversary,

14:27.567 --> 14:31.269
the tradition is paper.
But my gift is a hand cast.

14:31.271 --> 14:35.039
And our hands will be locked
together forever.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.208
What about in Albania?

14:40.679 --> 14:42.247
[both laugh]

14:43.849 --> 14:49.187
Um, fill the bucket
with 1.2 liters of cool water.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.489
This is the liter.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.224
[exclaims]
A little splash more.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.763
Okay, so half a bag and
then we mix it for one minute.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.631
[Florian] Step by step.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.633
- And then the other half.
- No, no.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.568
- [Florian] It's good.
- [Stacey] That's what it says.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.969
[Florian] It's good.
Half, half. [laughs]

15:04.971 --> 15:07.906
He's, like, really good
at anything he does.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.409
Woodworking, construction,
painting houses.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.014
To me you are.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.282
He's good with his hands.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.385
Now dunk it.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.022
You need to keep it, still.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.623
Yeah, stop movin'.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.492
We have to put
our hands together

15:27.494 --> 15:31.095
and make sure that
it's the perfect position.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.263
'Cause this is for life.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.364
[both] Yeah.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.867
[exclaims in pain]

15:35.869 --> 15:37.268
You're very strong.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.370
I'm sensitive, I'm little.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.072
Yeah.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.309
[both laugh]

15:45.945 --> 15:47.045
So, tell me your thoughts on,
um...

15:47.047 --> 15:48.913
What?

15:48.915 --> 15:51.349
Our dream wedding.
How do you visualize it?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.088
Mm-hmm.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.203
[exclaims] 400?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.139
Wow! Really?
I don't know 400 people.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.474
You know 400 people?

16:24.483 --> 16:26.951
- Aww.
- Yeah.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.386
Well, when you start working.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.488
Mm-hmm.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.730
Mm-Hmm.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.105
I think that's amazing that you're
being proactive and your meeting people.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.373
It's great.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.041
<i>I'm just really proud of him.</i>

16:50.043 --> 16:53.911
I mean he's not just sitting
on the couch eating bonbons.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.114
You know, he's-- He's out there
movin' and groovin', you know.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.350
Making connections,
networking, building his portfolio.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.419
You're a go getter.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.125
You're ready?
Let's see your hands.

17:10.129 --> 17:11.262
Oh [bleep]

17:11.264 --> 17:12.897
Eww.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.365
You did it wrong.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.533
No, I didn't

17:15.535 --> 17:16.967
You did.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.338
I followed the instructions. You
tried to do your own little thing.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.950
[laughs] No wonder why
it was all freaking water.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.853
Wow, so it's your fault.
And you blamed me.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.121
[producer laughs]

17:37.123 --> 17:38.956
Eww.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.491
Looks like brain.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.860
[laughs]

17:42.862 --> 17:44.328
[upbeat music playing]

17:59.044 --> 18:02.980
Today I'm heading to New York
because I decided to meet up with Georgi.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.353
Great!

18:14.760 --> 18:16.461
[sighs in exasperation]

18:16.463 --> 18:19.097
<i>I haven't told my family because</i>

18:19.099 --> 18:23.935
I just feel like no one is
really going to understand it.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.339
<i>But it's the respectful thing
to do.</i>

18:28.341 --> 18:32.610
I just want to be able to move on.
And for us to end things peacefully.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.312
<i>You know, I'm doing things
differently now.</i>

18:34.314 --> 18:36.247
<i>I'm breaking my ways
of the past.</i>

18:37.749 --> 18:39.450
[sighs heavily]

18:39.452 --> 18:41.652
You know I've had a lot of
toxic relationships.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.523
<i>And you know they've always
ended on a really bad note.</i>

18:45.525 --> 18:48.826
But this time I definitely
want to be the bigger person.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.896
And end things on a
better note. A positive note.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.099
So, there's no hurt feelings,
no animosity.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.069
I just want to break
the bad patterns.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.005
[Darcey sighs heavily]
Off we go.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.146
[sighs in exasperation]

19:12.084 --> 19:14.785
I'm trying not to let
my nerves get to me.

19:14.787 --> 19:18.156
But, you know...

19:26.832 --> 19:28.466
I don't know
what's going to happen?

19:28.468 --> 19:31.802
Hope you see
a different side of him?

19:31.804 --> 19:34.705
But for me,
emotionally, physically,

19:34.707 --> 19:37.008
it's just having to...

19:37.010 --> 19:39.777
hone those feelings
and make sure that

19:39.779 --> 19:45.383
I don't allow myself to go back to
the past patterns, those past feelings.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.186
So, protecting myself.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.759
<i>I'm nervous
about meeting Georgi.</i>

19:54.761 --> 19:58.863
I just had a major transformation.
I look completely different.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.333
<i>And curious to know
what he's going to think.</i>

20:03.936 --> 20:05.236
[sighs heavily]

20:09.708 --> 20:11.342
<i>I'm a little worried</i>

20:11.510 --> 20:16.480
because [sighs] I feel like he's going to
hold on to some resentment and anger.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.050
So, I don't know
what I'm about to walk into.

20:19.052 --> 20:23.020
I don't know what I'm about to
see and feel.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.248
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.026
[Darcey] You know...

21:03.629 --> 21:04.895
<i>It's very awkward.</i>

21:04.897 --> 21:08.232
I don't know if I should hug
him or he should hug me.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.135
Like we're strangers or
something.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.274
Oh, cute.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.442
[Darcey] Didn't know we were
having a picnic.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.077
It's nice.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.052
I mean, this is beautiful
and all.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.388
<i>Planning this picnic with
the flowers.</i>

21:31.189 --> 21:35.293
But I'm confused.
Very confused.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.895
He already knows I broke up
with him.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.365
I mean, it's nice but, this isn't why
I agreed to meet with Georgi today.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.175
It's okay.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.177
Thank you.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.415
Yes I did get--

21:57.783 --> 22:00.484
A new nose Georgi.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.020
It's fine. It's still healing.
It's not funny.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.790
I know I wasn't perfect.

22:05.792 --> 22:10.061
Yeah. I know. You're not touching right--
No, You're not touching these goods.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.483
<i>To hear Georgi apologize,</i>

24:13.485 --> 24:15.986
<i>to feel his emotions and,</i>

24:15.988 --> 24:18.155
<i>owning up to his own
accountability,</i>

24:19.024 --> 24:20.391
that's all I ever wanted.

24:21.793 --> 24:26.263
But I wish he did it a lot
sooner than today.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.501
Thank you for opening up
about that.

24:30.503 --> 24:36.974
I know it takes a lot of strength to
do that. And I see strength in you.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.644
But you have to understand
that the last part of our relationship

24:40.646 --> 24:43.347
was very difficult.

24:43.349 --> 24:48.185
And I just physically, emotionally,
spiritually can't do that anymore.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.289
So...

25:04.202 --> 25:08.305
I just don't feel right for me
to keep that.

25:14.746 --> 25:15.980
Take it.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.082
[Darcey] No. You just take--

25:22.754 --> 25:25.322
I don't know what you want
me to--

25:25.324 --> 25:27.057
[Darcey] Some superstitious.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.472
Okay.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.943
It's okay.

26:20.679 --> 26:22.346
<i>It's tough.</i>

26:22.348 --> 26:28.085
This is the last time we're
gonna hold each other.

26:28.087 --> 26:32.022
It's not easy to say goodbye but, I
just feel like it's something I have to do.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.429
I just... I need to go.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.338
Okay.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.240
You grab my bag?

26:51.009 --> 26:52.276
Don't forget your ring.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.186
[Darcey] I got it.

27:12.731 --> 27:13.831
This is the Florian I wanna
see right here.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.467
Supermodel. Right there.

27:16.469 --> 27:20.404
I've been focusing on my
marriage and having a child together.

27:20.672 --> 27:21.905
That didn't happen.

27:21.907 --> 27:25.843
Now what I need the most is to
put effort into what I love

27:25.845 --> 27:29.179
<i>and build House of Eleven
into a global brand.</i>

27:29.181 --> 27:31.448
<i>And I hope Florian is okay
with that.</i>

27:33.752 --> 27:36.487
[song playing]

27:48.033 --> 27:50.000
You must be excited.

27:52.904 --> 27:56.140
[Stacey] So you better go
there and do your best.

27:59.878 --> 28:02.579
That's with one of the top
photographers in the world.

28:02.581 --> 28:06.283
Fadil Berisha and, he knows
what he's doing.

28:06.285 --> 28:11.055
He's gonna help you... Probably get a
big agency, and then you will be able to be

28:11.656 --> 28:14.558
in top magazines and campaigns.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.094
As soon as you get
your work permit,

28:17.096 --> 28:20.764
You'll be able to take the
industry by storm.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.499
- [Stacey] Hello.
- [Florian] Hey.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.069
-[Stacey] Hey -[Fadil] Hey.
Welcome welcome. Finally.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.538
It's so nice to meet you both.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.974
I've heard so much about you. It's such
a pleasure and honor to be here today.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.409
After all this time.
Same here.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.679
I've been doing photography
for the last 35 years.

28:35.681 --> 28:40.617
<i>I've done it for Sharon Stone, Joan
Collins, Tara Banks, Kendall Jenner.</i>

28:40.619 --> 28:43.387
We shot her, which started
serve her career.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.255
Florian, we linked up on
social media and

28:45.257 --> 28:47.858
definitely saw something in him
and I wanted to do a shoot with him.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.995
We talked for a while about shooting
him. I was really inspired with his face.

28:51.997 --> 28:56.366
I saw his eyes and I said "We can do
some really nice pictures with him and

28:56.368 --> 28:58.869
would like to do that". Also,
he's Albanian, I'm Albanian.

28:58.871 --> 29:03.207
So, supporting, as an Albanian.
And I think it would be really nice.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.443
Florian has more friends in
America than I do.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.120
Wow!

29:16.122 --> 29:18.989
You look great, babe.
I love this.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.824
I love this look.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.226
This is our model for the day.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.428
Her name us Ina. She's also
Albanian.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.030
An Albanian beauty.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.333
Florian, he's also Albanian,
so...

29:29.335 --> 29:30.801
Nice to meet you.

29:30.803 --> 29:34.304
You didn't tell me you were doing
a photoshoot with another woman.

29:36.508 --> 29:40.377
I think, we will do a beauty shot
together. Just little more intimate.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.981
More like a boyfriend
girlfriend type.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.884
Why couldn't I have modeled
with you?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.753
I know we look good together.
And I'm beautiful.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.288
I'm not no chump change.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.891
Florian, are you ready?

29:53.893 --> 29:54.825
Cool.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.994
<i>[Fadil] She got confidence.</i>

29:57.428 --> 30:00.898
- Let's go. Follow.
- Let's go. Let's do it.

30:00.900 --> 30:06.303
I mean I'm not jealous. I'm just shocked
that like, you know, you didn't tell me.

30:10.775 --> 30:11.508
No. I'm just joking.

30:13.344 --> 30:14.845
I'm not jealous though.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.113
I believe it's gonna be
all good.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.981
Today is for your portfolio.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.249
I have you for life.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.953
Come the other side.

30:23.588 --> 30:25.656
Come closer.
Yeah, you're fine.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.858
All right. So turn, get a
little closer to her.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.360
Florian, move your chin
forward. Get a little closer to her.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.830
It's okay. It has got to
look real.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.699
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, what's
going on here. That's it right there.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.267
Perfect...

30:37.269 --> 30:39.636
Beautiful. Okay let's go for
the next look now.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.371
Next location.

30:42.941 --> 30:46.109
Just like that. That's
gorgeous. That's gorgeous.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.711
Right there. Don't move.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.214
That's stunning. This is the
Florian I wanna see right here.

30:50.216 --> 30:53.951
Supermodel. Right there.
That's gorgeous. Nice.

30:55.587 --> 31:01.792
This is amazing energy being surrounded
by Fadil, and Florian getting his groove.

31:01.794 --> 31:04.795
It just brings me back to the past when
Darcey and I would do photoshoots with

31:04.797 --> 31:06.830
House of Eleven.

31:06.832 --> 31:10.901
But what Darcey and I love the most
is doing fashion shows, fashion events.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.136
It's the best feeling
in the world.

31:15.907 --> 31:19.810
Over the past year, I've been
focusing on my marriage

31:19.812 --> 31:22.012
and having a child together.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.948
But it didn't happen, so...

31:27.018 --> 31:31.121
Now what I need the most is to
look forward to the future.

31:31.956 --> 31:33.490
And we're done. That's it.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.025
- Whoo!
- Wow.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.260
Here we go.

31:36.262 --> 31:40.230
And just being here, being in
this professional surrounding,

31:40.232 --> 31:43.834
I'm just so inspired right now.

31:43.836 --> 31:47.337
<i>Since Florian has been here, I've
been doing everything to support him and</i>

31:47.339 --> 31:49.840
help him and now it's time
for me.

31:49.842 --> 31:53.010
It's time for me to put effort
into what I love.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.412
And I hope Florian is okay
with that.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.984
Thank you so much.
You're beautiful.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.119
Thank you.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.057
Morning.

32:42.193 --> 32:47.264
After Georgi helped me with my
bags, he stayed over.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.499
Last night in my hotel room.

32:54.839 --> 32:56.206
Umm.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.043
A little regretful.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.420
It's good.
Glad you slept well.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.334
I promised myself
I wouldn't do that.

33:26.938 --> 33:31.208
That I wouldn't open myself
up to those feelings again.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.644
It's not like make up sex.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.347
We're not back together. We're
still in the same boat.

33:40.785 --> 33:44.988
I need to get dressed so we
can check out of this hotel.

33:50.928 --> 33:54.031
I came here to do what I needed
to do which was give the ring back.

33:54.232 --> 33:58.135
But instead,

33:58.137 --> 34:02.005
I lost a little control for myself
when I saw Georgi, I felt like

34:02.007 --> 34:05.809
he did and said everything I wanted
to hear and he made me feel special,

34:05.811 --> 34:07.377
he made me feel loved and

34:09.113 --> 34:12.449
just kind of let myself,

34:15.787 --> 34:18.321
you know, be open to that.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.226
- I'm gonna call the car.
- [door closes]

34:24.629 --> 34:28.565
But still in the back of my mind I
felt like, I could handle whatever.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.234
The next day, like...
be strong and

34:32.970 --> 34:36.339
not worry about getting
reattached to Georgi again.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.444
But it's hard.

34:46.651 --> 34:49.119
Five minutes. Five minutes.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.669
You still mean a lot to me.
I just am scared.

35:39.671 --> 35:42.005
Don't wanna get hurt again.

35:49.780 --> 35:54.451
My heart is telling me that I still
have feelings for Georgi. I love him still.

35:57.321 --> 36:01.958
I feel like he's making
strides to better himself.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.398
But my head is telling me, "no".

36:10.768 --> 36:15.172
Georgi was so dismissive
and cold.

36:15.174 --> 36:19.109
And I don't wanna falter back
to the old Darcey.

36:19.111 --> 36:22.112
So, I don't know what to do.

36:28.886 --> 36:31.154
I need time to process
everything.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.801
I don't even know what
[bleep] to say anymore.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.903
- This is too much.
- I know.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.939
I can't believe she [bleep] him.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.140
I know.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.209
I can't. I can't. Sorry.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.687
- I don't like...
- No. No no no...

37:03.689 --> 37:05.088
What's that? Is that lipstick?

37:05.090 --> 37:07.724
- No.
- Here's that gloss that give you that bee stung look.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.125
Like that kissable lip.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.229
Tried to make a kiss
but I can't.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.364
Do this.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.300
No. Like a lot. I just wanna
see how big they are.

37:17.302 --> 37:18.969
It hurts. I don't wanna pop
the threads.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.237
Hold on.

37:21.305 --> 37:22.872
[both exclaiming]

37:22.874 --> 37:24.140
It hurt.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.275
Oh, mommy.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.010
I know.

37:28.112 --> 37:30.847
[all] Hey.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.382
Over here.

37:32.384 --> 37:35.051
<i>[Darcey] Stacey, Deb and Reina are
coming over and we're gonna catch up.</i>

37:35.053 --> 37:38.488
Debbie and Reina, they've
already seen the new do.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.457
The new us.

37:40.459 --> 37:44.261
I'm so glad they love our new look
because, can't really, you know, return it.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.097
See you guys later.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.498
[all] All right, girls, bye,
love you.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.834
- Love you girls.
- Love you. Bye guys.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.068
- Such good girls.
- Yeah.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.169
- I'm proud of...
- So blessed.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.838
We all have good kids.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.972
- Oh yeah.
- So blessed.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.274
I have good doggies.

37:57.775 --> 37:58.775
I know.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.910
Deb's a good doggie mom.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.246
So, what's new with you?

38:03.814 --> 38:07.050
Um, kind of a lot.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.919
With House of Eleven, we wanna
expand the company.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.255
We wanna expand the clothing
line and do swimwear.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.757
- That's awesome.
- Wow.

38:13.759 --> 38:18.628
And I was thinking that we can enter
Miami Swim Week, do a fashion show.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.198
- Hmm.
- This is our opportunity for ourselves to get back into

38:22.200 --> 38:24.934
- what we truly want to do.
- Get in the groove.

38:24.936 --> 38:25.568
- Right.
- Yeah. That's huge.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.769
Yeah.

38:26.771 --> 38:30.774
Miami Swim Week is like the
hottest fashion show around.

38:30.776 --> 38:34.978
It's the perfect place to launch our
new House of Eleven swim collection.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.715
This could really up our game.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.984
Something we could focus on
that's positive and it will

38:40.986 --> 38:42.719
get my head in the right space.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.988
Good, girl. That's what I
like to hear, Darce.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.791
Don't worry about everybody
else. Worry about you two.

38:47.793 --> 38:48.858
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

38:48.860 --> 38:52.095
And Darce, you're single and
we're ready to mingle.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.902
When I got back from Turkey,
I told Debbie and Reina

38:58.904 --> 39:01.371
that Georgi and I aren't
together anymore.

39:01.373 --> 39:03.940
That I broke up with him when
I was in Turkey.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.945
I said, "if you respect me, make
sure you're not here when I get back."

39:08.947 --> 39:11.481
And I, I swear to god,
I felt free.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.016
And I continued my freedom.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.818
Darcey, I am so [bleep].

39:14.820 --> 39:15.819
I will not be taken
advantage of.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.387
I'm so proud of you.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.925
Debbie and Reina were happy to
hear it, so...

39:21.927 --> 39:24.461
I'm feeling a little apprehensive
to let them know that

39:24.463 --> 39:28.131
I went to see Georgi in
New York and things happened.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.669
Obviously, I felt like it's
the right thing to do to

39:32.671 --> 39:34.604
kind of like step away from
the relationship, take my time.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.841
But he has been trying to
communicate and,

39:37.843 --> 39:40.877
I don't think he was really serious
about when I said, "Were done".

39:40.879 --> 39:45.048
So, I met him in New York to have
that final closure and give back the ring.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.217
- Good.
- Darcie, We're proud of you.

39:47.485 --> 39:48.818
Stay strong.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.120
- I stayed strong.
- Empowerment.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.388
That was a big deal for me.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.390
- Good.
- Yeah.

39:55.292 --> 40:00.463
But... we did stay in New York that
night and got a little hot and heavy.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.471
- What?
- Yeah.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.340
So you you gave back the ring
and [bleep] the guy?

40:10.342 --> 40:11.708
God.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.310
That makes zero sense.
Zero sense.

40:14.312 --> 40:15.745
You just had friggin' surgery.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.814
- Yeah, I know.
- You gotta pop a stitch.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.984
I think he popped your brain
right the [bleep] out of your head.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.886
I can't believe she [bleep] him.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.487
I know. I know.

40:24.489 --> 40:30.093
So, like, "Here you go, Deb, I'm done
with you, but, let's go have [bleep]".

40:30.095 --> 40:31.861
I don't get it. Like, it
doesn't make any sense.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.797
- I can't.
- Yeah.

40:33.799 --> 40:38.501
He's made some changes for himself
and that shows me that he still cares

40:38.503 --> 40:40.870
and he wants to work it
out between us.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.139
I just don't wanna move fast.

40:43.141 --> 40:46.309
I'm still staying right down. We're
not engaged. We're not even a...

40:46.944 --> 40:48.011
"official couple."

40:48.013 --> 40:49.546
What changes though.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.347
- Darcie...
- What changes though? what...

40:51.349 --> 40:55.652
How many times have you been
on this same friggin' rollercoaster?

40:55.654 --> 41:00.523
You're repeating patterns over
and over again. This has got to stop.

41:00.525 --> 41:04.227
Darcie, you're really like, you can't can't
get out of your own way with this guy.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.499
You just want to love her and
help her and support her

41:09.501 --> 41:12.635
but Darcie is going to do what
Darcie wants to do. And that's fine.

41:12.637 --> 41:16.139
But then she comes back and
she's like, "help, help, help..."

41:16.141 --> 41:18.641
She cries, she gets upset,
she, you know--

41:18.643 --> 41:20.343
- And everyone does.
- It bothers us.

41:20.778 --> 41:22.278
- You're just hurting yourself.
- Yeah.

41:22.746 --> 41:26.149
But when you're hurting yourself,
you're hurting everybody around you too.

41:26.550 --> 41:30.620
We can't take it anymore.
How can you?

41:30.622 --> 41:33.590
<i>My friends have seen me do this
over and over again, and I understand</i>

41:33.592 --> 41:35.825
<i>they're frustrated because
I would be too.</i>

41:35.827 --> 41:40.930
And I will take accountability for
things that I feel like I've... let happen

41:40.932 --> 41:42.665
and the things that I've done.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.735
But I've changed since my trip
to Turkey.

41:45.737 --> 41:49.606
I became a strong, empowered
woman for myself...

41:49.608 --> 41:52.108
and I started
realizing my worth.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.979
So, this time around, I'm not
gonna let anybody hurt me.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.815
Like I did in the past.

41:58.817 --> 42:03.019
This is just so god damn crazy that I don't
even know what the [bleep] to say anymore.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.154
I ca... This is too much.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.191
Darce, Can I have a hug?
I love you.

42:08.193 --> 42:11.728
But right now, in this moment,
guys, I can't do it anymore.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.496
I can't... I can't. Sorry.

42:14.164 --> 42:16.099
You gotta figure
this [bleep] out.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.936
- Bye Stace.
- Bye guys.

42:20.003 --> 42:23.039
It's just a mess.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.475
-Love you Reina.
-Love you. Figure it out, bitch.
