Madhvi also record what I'm

It's just strange.

Do you really want everything
documented?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.467
Everything?

Well, I just feel like, let's
just... make Kris Jenner so

11:25.967 --> 11:28.200
uncomfortable.
It's fun.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.000
What? She queefed in our
workroom the other day.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.533
>> KRIS (laughing): I did not.
>> KHLOE: Yes, you did.

11:33.533 --> 11:38.667
She was queefing.
She did... queef.

11:38.667 --> 11:42.400

You are funny.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.233
You're funny to have around.

>> KHLOE: Oh, thanks, but I will

11:46.467 --> 11:48.667
say, as a child, the way you
used to talk to me when I

11:48.667 --> 11:51.567
thought my name was (bleep)
head.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.467
All you do is get drunk.
It's wild.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.467
They used to call Child
Services.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.900
You have no idea what I'd go
through on a nightly basis.

somebody's writing everything

12:00.900 --> 12:12.667
down.
It's not funny anymore.

>> KHLOE: I was trying to get in
touch with my mom, but she isn't

12:15.767 --> 12:19.600
calling me back.
I just know something's up with

12:19.600 --> 12:22.867
her, so why not ask Kim, her
favorite child?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.900
So, question.
>> KIM: Yeah.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.467
>> KHLOE: When we were at dinner
with Mom, do you think Mom had a

12:29.467 --> 12:34.333
nice time, or do you think she
was angry?

12:34.333 --> 12:37.633
>> KIM: I think she was, like,
laughing a lot, nervously

12:37.633 --> 12:40.133
laughing.
>> KHLOE: Did you think she...?

12:40.133 --> 12:43.266
>> KIM: You hurt her feelings?
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

12:43.266 --> 12:45.400
>> KIM: Yeah, just because I
know her.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.200
From the moment you started, I
knew she was, like, gonna...

12:49.200 --> 12:51.133
>> KHLOE: Then why would she
say, "You're so funny"?

12:51.133 --> 12:53.400
>> KIM: 'Cause I think she was
nervous at the moment in front

12:53.400 --> 12:55.400
of the girl.
>> KHLOE: Then why have the

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
scribe?
Like, it's stupid.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.400
Don't just be, "What?"
(murmuring gibberish)

12:59.400 --> 13:01.633
Like, obviously, you didn't
chain me to a wall, and it's

13:01.633 --> 13:04.500
my first time leaving.
Obviously, I didn't think my

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
name was (bleep) head till I was
ten.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.500
Obviously, like...
>> KIM: Yeah.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
>> KHLOE: Come on.
>> KIM: I mean, I get it.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.934
>> KHLOE: I just, like...
This family, I can't handle.

13:12.934 --> 13:15.834
You look cute.
>> KENDALL: Do I?

13:15.834 --> 13:18.200
>> KHLOE: Your belly button is
so vertical.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.200
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: I'm envious.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.533
I literally will get Botox
around my belly button just so

13:22.533 --> 13:24.667
it looks like that.
>> KIM: What?

13:24.667 --> 13:26.500
Who does this for you?
>> KHLOE: Well, I don't.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.333
I'm going to, is what I'm
saying.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.166
I'll do anything to tighten the
skin around it.

13:30.166 --> 13:39.433
>> KIM: No one's offered me
that.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.266
>> ANDY: Hi, ladies.
>> KHLOE: Hi. How are you?

13:41.266 --> 13:43.033
>> ANDY: I'm Andy.
Great to see you, Khloe.

13:43.033 --> 13:44.800
>> KHLOE: Hi. Khloe.
Nice to meet you. This is Kim.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.600
>> ANDY: Hi, Kim. Great to meet
you.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.200
>> KIM: Hi. How are you?
>> ALEXANDRA: Hi. I'm Alexandra.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.033
>> KHLOE: Hi. Khloe.
>> ANDY: I wanted to take you on

13:50.033 --> 13:51.667
a little tour if you have time.
>> KHLOE: Yeah, we would love

13:51.667 --> 13:54.166
that.
>> KIM: Yeah, for sure.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.867
As I've been doing my research,
I just feel like I have to start

13:57.867 --> 14:00.266
somewhere, and this is the
perfect place for me to get some

14:00.266 --> 14:03.333
more information, and to figure
out all of the questions that I

14:03.333 --> 14:06.333
really have as to what we can do
to help.

14:06.333 --> 14:10.166
I just hope that I can shine a
light on this issue, and that,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.800
hopefully, more people will come
together, and we can figure out

14:12.800 --> 14:15.600
a solution for this.
>> KHLOE: Oh, wow.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.934
>> ANDY: This is our beautiful
rooftop with one of the best

14:18.934 --> 14:21.834
views of, uh, downtown L.A.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.934
>> ANDY: But...
>> KIM: So, like, all these

14:29.934 --> 14:31.867
people that are just roaming the
streets-- do they not want to

14:31.867 --> 14:34.633
come and stay here?
>> ANDY: There just aren't

14:34.633 --> 14:38.967
enough shelter beds in L.A., so,
47,000 people are on the

14:38.967 --> 14:44.667
streets, and there's only 12,000
shelter beds to go to.

14:44.667 --> 14:49.467
This is the worst man-made
disaster in the United States.

14:49.467 --> 14:53.100
Over 2,000 people living on our
sidewalks.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.100
And, you know, people say they
want people to get off the

14:55.100 --> 14:57.100
streets.
There's nowhere to go.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.834
I can tell you, recently what's
causing it to skyrocket is the

15:01.834 --> 15:05.033
cost of rent.
Rents have gone up 30%.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.033
Salaries have gone down three
percent.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.033
So, it's like a perfect storm...
>> KIM: Yeah.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.834
>> ANDY: ...of homelessness,
especially in L.A.

15:11.834 --> 15:15.400
This year, we have 55% more
people under our roof, and...

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
>> KIM: And do you guys have the
space for that?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.567
>> ANDY: We've made space.
We never turn away a woman,

15:19.567 --> 15:22.867
because there's 800 registered
sex offenders on the streets, so

15:22.867 --> 15:27.500
our hearts won't let us.
>> KIM: The homeless issue is a

15:27.500 --> 15:32.567
full epidemic, and I don't know
what the answer is to get people

15:32.567 --> 15:36.700
off the streets, but I'm so
willing to help in any way that

15:36.700 --> 15:39.734
I can.
>> ANDY: You cannot survive on

15:39.734 --> 15:43.633
the streets without being
brutalized and devastated by the

15:43.633 --> 15:46.633
experience.
>> KIM: I just want to bring

15:46.633 --> 15:51.266
awareness to this issue.
Unfortunately, people do live in

15:51.266 --> 15:54.500
bubbles, and people probably
think, like, L.A. is this

15:54.500 --> 15:58.400
glamorous place.
It makes me feel really sad that

15:58.400 --> 16:00.734
people are just living like
this, and the problem's just

16:00.734 --> 16:02.633
getting worse.

16:04.433 --> 16:07.667
>> KHLOE: We really wanted to
educate ourselves, and if...

16:07.667 --> 16:10.800
Just kind of hear stories and
maybe, like, what we can do.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.333
>> LAQUITA: I just didn't have a
job that paid well enough to

16:14.333 --> 16:16.333
support us.
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.133
>> LATANYA: The things that I've
seen down here have...

16:18.133 --> 16:20.633
Just nasty things.
>> KIM: There are so many

16:20.633 --> 16:24.400
circumstances that can lead to
this situation for so many

16:24.400 --> 16:32.300
people.
This can happen to anyone.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.033
>> ANDY: This is the floor that
our families with children stay

16:35.033 --> 16:37.066
on.
>> ALEXANDRA: That's everybody's

16:37.066 --> 16:41.066
bags of clothing and everything.
We want to make sure our women

16:41.066 --> 16:46.233
feel safe, so we have separate
floors for everybody.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.033
>> KHLOE AND KIM: Hi.
>> ALEXANDRA: This is Khloe,

16:48.033 --> 16:49.900
this is Kim.
This is Alex Cornejo.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.900
>> KIM: Hi. Kim.
>> KHLOE: Hi. Khloe.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.567
>> ALEX: How you guys doing?
>> KHLOE: Nice to see you.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.100
>> ALEXANDRA: Alex is somebody
that came through out men's

16:55.100 --> 16:57.100
program, and has been working
here a little bit longer than

16:57.100 --> 16:58.934
me.
>> KHLOE: Do you guys want to

16:58.934 --> 17:05.033
sit down, or get comfortable?
Recently, we drove by, and we

17:05.033 --> 17:08.500
noticed how much its escalated--
the homelessness here in... from

17:08.500 --> 17:10.300
when we were younger.
>> KIM: And just how many tents

17:10.300 --> 17:13.233
there are, and just, we were,
like, shocked by what it looked

17:13.233 --> 17:16.400
like.
>> KHLOE: And so for us, we

17:16.400 --> 17:19.734
really wanted to educate
ourselves as to kind of why I

17:19.734 --> 17:23.867
think it's, like, multiplied,
and... just kind of hear

17:23.867 --> 17:26.166
stories, and maybe, like, what
we can do.

17:26.166 --> 17:29.467
>> ALEXANDRA: So, Laquita, I
wanted you to share, 'cause, um,

17:29.467 --> 17:32.066
I think Laquita's a great
example of somebody who didn't

17:32.066 --> 17:35.633
suffer from any of those issues
that you usually, typically ask.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.633
Like, is this person addicted?
Is there mental illness?

17:38.633 --> 17:40.934
She was just a mom who needed a
hand up.

17:40.934 --> 17:45.233
>> LAQUITA: Um, I just didn't
have a job that paid well enough

17:45.233 --> 17:48.467
for me to get my own place, you
know, and to support us.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.000
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> LAQUITA: We all don't come

17:51.000 --> 17:53.967
from abusive points of view, or
we're running away from our

17:53.967 --> 17:57.100
husbands or our boyfriends, or
we have drug or alcohol prob...

17:57.100 --> 17:59.500
Sometimes you just need a just
a place to...

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
(exhales)
... to take a breath and to move

18:01.500 --> 18:03.834
on.
>> KHLOE: Thank you for sharing.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.934
>> LAQUITA: Yeah. Yeah.
>> LATANYA: The reason I'm here

18:05.934 --> 18:11.066
is because I don't think I can
afford to pay housing on my own

18:11.066 --> 18:14.834
for my one-bedroom apartment.
I go to my brother's house, and

18:14.834 --> 18:17.667
he likes to smoke drugs.
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.700
>> LATANYA: And I can't stand
that.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.767
I don't even want to be around.
I don't want to see it.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.266
I drove down here, and I didn't
know this program here at the

18:25.266 --> 18:29.200
Union was like it was.
It's a good program if people do

18:29.200 --> 18:32.633
what they came here to do.
>> KHLOE: Right.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.633
>> LATANYA: But if they don't,
that's why they end up out

18:34.633 --> 18:36.834
there.
The things that I've seen down

18:36.834 --> 18:39.700
here have...
Just nasty things.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.467
>> KHLOE: Right.
>> KIM: There are so many

18:43.467 --> 18:47.200
circumstances that can lead to,
you know, this situation for so

18:47.200 --> 18:50.000
many people.
And I think just having a place

18:50.000 --> 18:54.834
where they take in mothers and
their children-- that is so

18:54.834 --> 18:58.166
important, because they are so
vulnerable when they're on the

18:58.166 --> 19:03.633
streets to rapists and
pedophiles and drug trafficking.

19:03.633 --> 19:07.600
This can happen to anyone.
It's just really sad to hear

19:07.600 --> 19:10.567
that, you know, so many people
are just one paycheck away from

19:10.567 --> 19:14.166
being homeless.
>> PATRICE: My name is Patrice.

19:14.166 --> 19:17.800
I became homeless, um, probably
in 2014 due to a financial

19:17.800 --> 19:21.433
hardship.
I'd been doing it on my own, hit

19:21.433 --> 19:24.800
financial hardship, lost my
income and became homeless.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.834
Then went to stay with friends,
and, you know, staying with

19:27.834 --> 19:30.900
friends don't work out a lot, so
end up back on the street.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.900
>> KIM: It's okay.
>> PATRICE (crying): But that's

19:32.900 --> 19:35.233
where I'm at now.
But they gave me a voucher, I'm

19:35.233 --> 19:38.667
looking for a place now, and
I've been here since Saturday.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.700
>> KHLOE: Since Saturday?
>> PATRICE: Mm-hmm.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.467
>> STEVE: For most of society,
it seems like there's this net

19:43.467 --> 19:46.066
or web that kind of catches you
when you fall.

19:46.066 --> 19:48.633
I think for some, that net or
web-- there was never the

19:48.633 --> 19:51.300
father, there was never the
mother, there was never aunts

19:51.300 --> 19:54.600
and uncles to help facilitate.
And so they just kind of fell

19:54.600 --> 19:56.567
through the cracks, and all of a
sudden, now they end up here,

19:56.567 --> 19:59.033
that it's just completely
inundated.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.867
>> KIM: Thank you guys so much
for sharing your stories with

20:00.867 --> 20:02.767
us.
>> LATANYA AND LAQUITA: Thank

20:02.767 --> 20:06.000
you for coming.
>> PATRICE: Thank you.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.734
Thank you.
>> KIM: Thank you.

20:08.734 --> 20:16.300
>> LATANYA: And thank you.
>> KIM: Hi.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.000
>> KHLOE: Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.300
Thank you.
So crazy.

20:22.300 --> 20:27.633
I mean just these... people are
such good people.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.867
You know, I do think...
Like, I don't know.

20:29.867 --> 20:33.133
Dad always made us do things,
so, like, I have never been

20:33.133 --> 20:35.834
scared of stuff like this.
>> KIM: I mean, obviously, to

20:35.834 --> 20:39.033
have awareness.
>> KHLOE: Totally.

20:39.033 --> 20:42.667
I think it is important to teach
your kids that stuff.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.300
>> KIM: Totally.
I think it's so important.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.233
From this experience, I've
learned that it's just not that

20:48.233 --> 20:50.300
simple.
The city needs to figure out

20:50.300 --> 20:52.867
housing, and it's not gonna be
just one person.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.967
It has to be a bunch of people
coming together to figure this

20:55.967 --> 20:57.867
out.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.734
Just seeing how many people
don't really have an option

21:02.734 --> 21:10.000
really was so sad.
>> KHLOE: So sad.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
>> KRIS: Medication for Khloe's
lice.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.500
So, she has this fungus.
(laughing): This is for your

21:14.500 --> 21:16.734
colon health.
>> KHLOE: Kourt, she's trying to

21:16.734 --> 21:20.767

21:20.767 --> 21:24.300

>> KIM: Wait. I want to look up
some stuff.

21:54.667 --> 21:58.266
That was really sad.
So I just want to Google, like,

21:58.266 --> 22:03.633
other things on Skid Row, 'cause
I feel like... there's just so

22:03.633 --> 22:07.567
many more, like, untold stories.
>> KHLOE: I wonder how many

22:07.567 --> 22:09.467
shelters are downtown.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.900
'Cause when we were driving by
that time, we were naming

22:13.900 --> 22:15.600
shelters.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.433

about this, um...

22:19.433 --> 22:24.367
And when we talk about all of us
sharing the burden of how and

22:24.367 --> 22:29.667
how we deal with the homeless
issue, we have paid the price of

22:29.667 --> 22:33.600
poor land use decisions for
people who live in these

22:33.600 --> 22:36.300
sensitive areas.
And now we're saying it's okay

22:36.300 --> 22:39.834
to have people live in their
vehicles, in these very areas

22:39.834 --> 22:42.300
that we're trying to protect
people from.

22:42.300 --> 22:47.033
It's going to become a problem
in the northeast San Fernando

22:47.033 --> 22:50.066

City 6.

22:52.900 --> 22:56.734

just getting the information.

some major insight on what I can

23:07.567 --> 23:11.500

something that I could fix by

31:01.934 --> 31:05.200
myself, but I hope that
everything that I'm learning

31:05.200 --> 31:08.800
will hopefully wake something up
inside of other people, so that

31:08.800 --> 31:13.633
everyone can just come together.
And, you know, if me speaking

31:13.633 --> 31:19.400
about it even brings awareness
to one person, then that can

31:19.400 --> 31:22.367
help make a difference.

31:22.367 --> 31:24.800

railroad tracks.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.700
And this is probably one of
our... the most difficult

31:28.700 --> 31:33.800
encampment to clean up.
And look at the trash and the

31:33.800 --> 31:39.433
amount of debris.
>> KIM: Yeah.

31:39.433 --> 31:42.967
So, let's say you get out and
you want to talk to people, what

31:42.967 --> 31:45.867
would you say?
>> NURY: I would just ask 'em

31:45.867 --> 31:48.300

"There's a place in L.A. that's

And I know this is, like, a lot,
to share your stories, and I

41:50.934 --> 41:55.266
think it'll help so many people
just... put a different face on

41:55.266 --> 41:57.667
homelessness.
'Cause I think that so many

41:57.667 --> 42:01.867
people just have such an idea of
what that looks like, and it's

42:01.867 --> 42:04.700
really so different.
And so many people that are just

42:04.700 --> 42:06.734
a paycheck away from being
homeless.

42:06.734 --> 42:10.400
So, I appreciate you guys for
sharing your stories with us.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.900
And, you know, today I just
wanted to pamper you guys.

42:13.900 --> 42:18.633
We have people inside that are
gonna talk to you about money

42:18.633 --> 42:22.266
management and things that I
wish they taught in high school

42:22.266 --> 42:25.233
and in schools that they just
never really teach you, and

42:25.233 --> 42:29.200
women in there to help you write
résumés for jobs.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.767
It's just a pampering day 'cause
you guys really all deserve it

42:32.767 --> 42:36.967
so much.

42:36.967 --> 42:40.900
There's so many organizations,
but the epidemic is just growing

42:40.900 --> 42:46.000
so much that... you know, every
organization just needs more

42:46.000 --> 42:48.333
resources.
>> WOMAN: Okay, so what we're

42:48.333 --> 42:51.266
gonna end up doing is moving
"work experience" to the top.

42:51.266 --> 42:53.266
>> CAROLINE: This is our
after-school program, and we

42:53.266 --> 42:56.433
have a day care right in this
building, also, on this floor in

42:56.433 --> 42:58.433
the bottom floor.
>> KIM: I mean, the problem is

42:58.433 --> 43:02.333
just so big that it's not gonna
take, you know, just one person

43:02.333 --> 43:04.333
saying they want to make a
difference.

43:04.333 --> 43:07.266
It's gonna take, like, the whole
city and the country coming

43:07.266 --> 43:12.333
together to fix this huge issue.
>> PHOTOGRAPHER: All right, one,

43:12.333 --> 43:15.133
two, three.
>> KIM: Next on...

43:15.133 --> 43:18.633
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God!
(dogs barking)

43:18.633 --> 43:20.967
Kim, yours really makes a lot of
noise.

43:20.967 --> 43:22.533
>> KIM: Kourtney's does not
bark.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.800
I want to go swap.
>> KOURTNEY: Give me your dog.

43:24.800 --> 43:28.433
Guess who this is.
>> KENDALL: I literally once a

43:28.433 --> 43:30.433
week have a stalker.
>> KHLOE: I want to protect

43:30.433 --> 43:32.133
myself.
>> KIM: I'm not comfortable with

43:32.133 --> 43:33.867
it.
I wouldn't want my kids around

43:33.867 --> 43:36.367
it.
I wouldn't want the kids here,

43:36.367 --> 43:38.700
and I know there's a gun.
>> KHLOE: I want to feel

43:38.700 --> 43:42.100
comfortable around a gun.
