00:03.035 --> 00:04.200
Hi.

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
Hi.

00:05.935 --> 00:07.300
Are you Amy?

00:07.600 --> 00:08.600
I'm Ricky.

00:08.635 --> 00:11.500
You're not just moving in with Dad
so I can have your room for a nursery?

00:11.535 --> 00:13.900
I know we've only been dating
for a few weeks...

00:13.935 --> 00:16.000
Grace, I really don't want
you dating anyone else.

00:16.035 --> 00:19.500
I just don't know if my parents would
think we were getting serious too quickly.

00:19.535 --> 00:22.100
I just don't see how
this is gonna work.

00:22.135 --> 00:24.700
I mean, how do we even know
I have a birth canal?

00:24.735 --> 00:26.200
Uhn, get my Mom.

00:26.235 --> 00:31.200
- Oh, this really, really hurts.
- I'm not--I'm not very good with pain.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.900
Find your mother. Ow!
Hurry, hurry!Ow, baby, ow!

00:35.935 --> 00:38.200
- Why are you screaming?
- Your nails!

00:38.235 --> 00:41.000
Please, be nice to me.
I need a friend.

00:41.035 --> 00:42.700
Can we just be friends?

00:42.735 --> 00:44.700
Are you even capable
of being a friend?

00:44.735 --> 00:45.800
I like you.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.900
I like you a lot. And we're
going to the same school and...

00:48.935 --> 00:51.500
Well, this could be the start
of something big.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.900
Be cool. Oh, my God!

00:56.500 --> 00:58.100
Crap.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.900
Can we wake her up?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.100
I mean, how can she
be sleeping like this?

01:16.135 --> 01:18.100
Shh.
She needs her rest.

01:18.135 --> 01:19.300
I need the rest.

01:19.335 --> 01:20.400
We could all use the rest.

01:20.435 --> 01:22.000
You wanna go home,
take a nap, come back?

01:22.035 --> 01:24.600
Yeah, while I'm at it why don't
I go get a spa treatment too?

01:24.635 --> 01:27.100
Or maybe you could get an epidural

01:27.135 --> 01:29.600
and make this a whole lot
easier on Ashley and me.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.700
- Is that your boyfriend?
- You said no cell phones.

01:33.735 --> 01:36.700
I have it on silent.
I'll be right back.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
This were 50 years ago,
I'd be in a nearby bar

01:41.835 --> 01:43.400
having a drink and waiting
for a phone call.

01:43.435 --> 01:45.700
If this was 50 years ago,

01:45.900 --> 01:47.200
Amy would be in a home
and we'd be saying

01:47.235 --> 01:49.800
she was at special music
college in the Midwest.

01:49.835 --> 01:52.500
Yeah, we would have made your mom
wear a pillow for nine months.

01:52.535 --> 01:53.600
Then she would have given
birth suddenly

01:53.635 --> 01:55.200
when we were on vacation
in the Midwest.

01:55.235 --> 01:57.600
Oh, those were the good old days.

01:57.635 --> 02:00.800
Ah, yes, the era of shame.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.900
Too bad we missed that one, huh?

02:03.700 --> 02:07.300
Hey, uh, does she need anything?
Ice chips? Anything?

02:07.335 --> 02:08.400
Ben.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.500
Hi, Amy.
How you doing?

02:11.535 --> 02:12.300
I'm okay.

02:12.335 --> 02:13.600
Can I do anything for you?

02:13.635 --> 02:15.300
No, just be here.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.900
- I'm going to be here.
- Well, not here in the room.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.200
I don't care anymore.

02:20.235 --> 02:21.600
Yes, you do.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.000
I think she's just out of it.

02:25.035 --> 02:28.300
And I think I've proven that I
shouldn't be here for the actual birth.

02:28.335 --> 02:31.500
Uh, but if either one of you
want my video camera--

02:31.535 --> 02:33.000
We don't.

02:33.035 --> 02:34.900
Well, don't you think
that the baby

02:34.935 --> 02:37.400
will wanna see himself
being born when he's older?

02:37.435 --> 02:40.100
As well as his mother
giving birth to him?

02:40.135 --> 02:41.000
Right.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.600
Ashley can do it.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.100
- Please, Ashley.
- Oh, great, now she's awake.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.800
Amy,

02:48.700 --> 02:51.200
I do not care to see you
that up close and personal.

02:51.235 --> 02:54.000
I do not want to see the baby
actually being born.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.200
No one does.

02:55.235 --> 02:58.500
It's a conspiracy by
video-camera manufacturers.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.900
No one really wants
to see the baby on camera

03:00.935 --> 03:04.200
until it's clean and smiling,
about three years from now.

03:04.235 --> 03:06.500
Ha-ha. You're funny.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.000
- Just like Dad.
- How you doing, kiddo?

03:10.035 --> 03:10.800
I'm okay.

03:10.835 --> 03:11.900
I love you, Amy.

03:11.935 --> 03:14.800
Ben, my dad is right here.

03:14.835 --> 03:17.500
- I love you too.
- And we love you, Benjamin.

03:17.535 --> 03:19.500
God, when is this all gonna stop?

03:19.535 --> 03:22.600
Every minute we're in here,
I'm another year away from having sex.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.500
Take your time, Amy.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.700
Hi, Amy.

03:26.735 --> 03:29.000
- Hey, girl, did you get a little nap?
- Mm

03:29.035 --> 03:31.400
- Should we step out?
- Yes, you might wanna step out.

03:31.435 --> 03:33.500
We'll let you know
when you can step back in.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.000
It won't be much longer.

03:37.035 --> 03:38.700
The contractions
are getting closer together.

03:38.735 --> 03:42.400
Yeah, I think he might wanna
stay a little longer.

03:42.435 --> 03:44.600
I think I might want him
to stay a little longer.

03:44.635 --> 03:46.200
Don't be scared, Amy.

03:46.235 --> 03:48.800
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Let's get some music going

03:48.835 --> 03:52.500
get relaxed,let nature take its course.
This is a natural process, you know.

03:52.535 --> 03:54.900
Then why do I have a big needle
in my spine?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.400
Because sometimes nature sucks.

03:56.435 --> 03:58.800
Mom, don't make me laugh.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.400
Um, seriously though,
how much is it gonna hurt?

04:04.500 --> 04:05.500
Don't think about that.

04:05.535 --> 04:07.000
What am I supposed to think about?

04:07.035 --> 04:10.400
Think about your baby,
think about your son.

04:10.435 --> 04:12.000
I think he's ready.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.500
From this point on,
it's all about him.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.600
It would only take 10 minutes.
Ten minutes.

04:46.635 --> 04:48.700
I can't stay awake any longer.

04:48.735 --> 04:49.800
I need coffee.

04:49.835 --> 04:51.800
Can't you stay awake
on adrenaline?

04:51.835 --> 04:53.500
Our best friend
is having a baby.

04:53.535 --> 04:55.900
My adrenaline ran out hours ago.

04:55.935 --> 04:59.000
You're 15.
You can stay up all night.

04:59.035 --> 05:01.700
This would not be the first time
you've stayed up all night.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.500
We stayed awake all night the
night we found out Amy was pregnant.

05:04.535 --> 05:07.200
So I think we can stay up
all night the night she has the baby.

05:07.235 --> 05:10.300
Ten minutes.
What's 10 minutes?

05:10.335 --> 05:11.400
All right, fine.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.100
I'll have a nonfat latte.

05:13.135 --> 05:15.000
Tell that to the barista.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.500
Wait, where are you two going?

05:18.535 --> 05:19.500
Coffee run.

05:19.535 --> 05:22.000
I'll have a triple nonfat,
sugar-free, hazelnut latte.

05:22.035 --> 05:23.700
Not unless you come with us.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.800
I'm not your waitress
and neither is she.

05:25.835 --> 05:27.200
Get me a chai tea latte with honey.

05:27.235 --> 05:29.300
- I'm going?
- Can't you get me a cup of tea?

05:29.335 --> 05:30.400
I slept with you.

05:31.335 --> 05:32.400
I remember.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.200
All right, I'll go with you.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.500
Whoa, hold it.

05:41.535 --> 05:42.800
What happened?
Did she have the baby?

05:42.835 --> 05:45.800
We're just going to get coffee.
Jack, you want anything?

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
- Nice.
- Yeah I'll have a strawberry smoothie.

05:48.135 --> 05:48.800
Me too.

05:48.835 --> 05:51.600
I'll have one of those frozen blended
things with caramel whipped cream.

05:51.635 --> 05:52.900
Hello?

05:52.935 --> 05:56.400
No one is going to get anyone
to bring them back coffee.

05:56.435 --> 05:58.400
Either we all go or we all stay.

05:58.435 --> 05:59.800
Wait, I'll go.

05:59.835 --> 06:02.800
Maybe we should just
get a hotel roomtem,

06:03.100 --> 06:04.800
and get some sleep.

06:04.835 --> 06:07.700
- If you want, yeah.
- I don'think so, Tammy.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.100
Not until you're married.

06:09.135 --> 06:12.100
Your sister is such a buzz kill.

06:12.500 --> 06:16.800
No one said anything about having sex.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.400
I just want some sleep.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.200
All right, we'll go.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.600
Oh, that's nothing.

06:36.635 --> 06:38.900
I'm pretty sure they were making
out before the baby shower.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.400
You got served.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
- We have to get boyfriends.
- I have a boyfriend.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.800
So I guess it's just
you and me without boyfriends.

06:52.835 --> 06:55.500
I'm getting Henry back. I was
just trying to make him jealous.

06:55.535 --> 06:58.900
- But I though he wasn't--
- We'll see about that.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.700
So, the doctor's in.
I think she's almost ready--

07:08.300 --> 07:09.300
Where is everybody?

07:09.335 --> 07:11.300
I just passed them.
They're going to get coffee.

07:11.335 --> 07:13.100
- She almost there?
- Yep.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.200
What does that mean,
almost there?

07:15.235 --> 07:18.600
I don't know, but I think that now
she starts the pushing and ining.

07:18.635 --> 07:19.700
What's the ving part?

07:19.735 --> 07:21.700
I don't know.
Uh, but the doctor came in

07:21.735 --> 07:24.800
and she looks,
uh, ready to deliver a baby.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.500
Who's in there with Amy
and the doctor?

07:26.535 --> 07:27.600
Just her mom.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.400
You didn't wanna be in there
with her, did you?

07:30.435 --> 07:32.600
- What?
- When she has the baby?

07:32.635 --> 07:33.600
Oh, of course not.

07:33.635 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, me neither.

07:35.035 --> 07:37.100
Then, uh,
what's the camera for?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.200
Oh, jeez.
Uh, where did I leave Ashley?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.800
Oh. Hey, here, I-I forgot this.
Uh, here's the zoom.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.100
It's just for her face, I just
wanna see the look on her face.

07:52.135 --> 07:55.000
I'm not video taping Amy's face
or anything else for that matter.

07:55.035 --> 07:57.500
Ashley, Amy's asking for you.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.900
Oh, she wants you
to bring the camera.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.400
I reserve the right
to edit that be you see it.

08:07.435 --> 08:09.300
That's fine.
I don't even need to see it.

08:09.335 --> 08:11.600
It's just for Amy and the baby,
when he grows up.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.900
- How is she?
- She's okay. How you doing?

08:15.935 --> 08:18.200
- Me?
- Yeah, Dad, how you doing?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.600
You wanna call your Mom or Dad
to get them down here?

08:20.635 --> 08:22.800
Should I do that?
Am I supposed to do that?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.200
- Do that if you want.
- I don't know.

08:24.235 --> 08:25.700
It seems if I'm old enough
to be a father,

08:25.735 --> 08:28.300
I shouldn't call my Mommy
and Daddy to come hold my hand.

08:28.335 --> 08:31.500
Right, well, after the baby's born,
you might wanna call them.

08:31.535 --> 08:33.000
I'm sure they gonna wanna see him.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.200
Thanks, Mr. Juergens,
for bein to me. And--

08:36.235 --> 08:39.100
Don't say it.
It is what it is.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.299
I don't think anyone should see
what's going on in there.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.800
Come on, we'll go
sit down somhere.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.600
Is she okay?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.100
I don't know
how she could be.

08:51.135 --> 08:52.800
She's too young
to be having a baby.

08:52.835 --> 08:55.300
Yeah, well, she is, and--

08:55.335 --> 08:58.100
Jeez, Ash, I just hope
she can get through this.

08:58.135 --> 08:59.400
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.600
Is your Dad coming down here?

09:01.635 --> 09:02.700
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.300
Put your head between
your legs, you'll be okay.

09:05.335 --> 09:06.600
I'm okay.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.000
Really, I'm fine.

09:09.700 --> 09:15.500
I'm not really squeamish. It's
just I hate to hear Amy in pain.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.900
- It's killing me.
- I just feel so guilty.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.300
I feel so damn guilty. I
can't believe I did this.

09:23.335 --> 09:28.600
- Yeah, well, you did do this.
- But it is what is.

09:29.400 --> 09:34.810
And who knows why but maybe
it was just meant to happen.

09:34.845 --> 09:38.800
Although I don't think
it's meant to happen again.

09:38.835 --> 09:41.700
Yeah, believe me,
it's not gonna happen again.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.900
I'm thinking
about getting fixed.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.300
I mean it. state should make me
get a vasectomy or something.

09:48.335 --> 09:50.100
Ricky, you're 16.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.000
You're in high school.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.500
I mean, maybe one day you'd like
to grow up and get married

09:55.535 --> 09:56.700
and have some more children.

09:56.735 --> 09:59.300
I don't think so.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
This is it for me.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.600
I don't even deserve
to have this one.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.900
I don't deserve to have a baby
with a girl this nice.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.000
With Amy.

10:14.900 --> 10:18.100
God, I can't believe
I did something so stupid

10:18.135 --> 10:20.900
that's changed
the lives of so many people.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.000
- I hate myself.
- Hey, you--

10:26.200 --> 10:29.700
you can't enter into the world of
fatherhood with that kind of attitude.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.100
Your son's gonna need you.

10:32.135 --> 10:35.300
Why? He'll have you,
and Amy, and her family.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.400
You're his family, Ricky.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.300
You're his father.

10:38.335 --> 10:40.900
Whoever raises the child
is his father, and--

10:41.200 --> 10:42.100
I don't know.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.100
I don't know if I can do it,
or if I should do it.

10:46.135 --> 10:48.500
Maybe I should leave now before
I mess up anything.

10:48.535 --> 10:50.500
You're not gonna walk
away from this.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.500
If you were gonna
walk away from this,

10:52.535 --> 10:54.400
you would have walked
long before now.

10:54.435 --> 10:56.200
How does this work?
How do I act like a father

10:56.235 --> 10:58.000
when you're Amy's boyfriend?

10:58.035 --> 11:00.600
How are the three of us gonna
raise a child together?

11:00.635 --> 11:02.600
This is just crazy, Ben.

11:02.635 --> 11:06.700
I admit it's crazy.
But we'll do the best we can.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.900
I mean, hey, who would have thought that
six months ago, that we'd be friends?

11:12.300 --> 11:13.500
What?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.900
Yeah, we're friends,
don't you think?

11:15.935 --> 11:17.400
Friends, I don't know.

11:17.435 --> 11:19.000
I don't think I've ever
had a friend before,

11:19.035 --> 11:21.400
and I don't know
why we'd be friends now.

11:21.900 --> 11:27.000
We've been forced to deal with
each other because of this situation.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.100
We've got nothing in common
other than Amy and the baby.

11:30.135 --> 11:33.100
And that doesn't seem
it would make a good fendship.

11:33.135 --> 11:37.800
If any it seems we have no possibility
of ever really being friends Ben.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.200
Why not?

11:39.201 --> 11:40.757
Why not?
Think about it.

11:40.835 --> 11:42.900
As the years go by,
we're gonna always be arguing

11:42.935 --> 11:44.900
over the two things
that brought us together:

11:44.935 --> 11:46.300
Amy and the baby.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.200
Yeah, but as the years go by,

11:48.235 --> 11:52.791
there are gonna be holidays
and birthday parties

11:52.826 --> 11:54.300
and the first day of school and--

11:54.335 --> 11:56.800
Who does he get to spend
Christmas Eve with?

11:56.900 --> 11:58.700
What about Christmas Day?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.200
And do I get him for part
of his birthday by myself

12:01.235 --> 12:04.300
or do I have to go over to Amy's house
if I want to see him on his birthday

12:04.335 --> 12:06.200
Is she taking him
to the first day of school?

12:06.235 --> 12:08.800
Is she gonna let me teach
him to play baseball?

12:08.835 --> 12:12.500
Or is her dad?
Your future father-in-law?

12:13.300 --> 12:16.600
And if he wants a pont
for his birthday and I say no,

12:16.800 --> 12:19.600
are you gonna say yes
and get it for him anyway?

12:20.000 --> 12:24.713
No, my friend, we've got a lifetime
of arguing over Amy's son.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.000
Did you talk to Amy
about any of this, or--

12:27.035 --> 12:28.300
No, I didn't. Why?

12:28.335 --> 12:30.700
Because I was just trying
to cheer you up.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.500
Listen, we can figure out
all this stuff later,

12:34.535 --> 12:38.300
or you and Amy can figure
out all this stuff later.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.600
But for now,fo just
take it one day at a time.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.100
And I think that today,
we should be friends.

12:49.100 --> 12:53.100
Truce from all the battles
yet to be had?

12:53.135 --> 12:54.500
I guess.

12:54.535 --> 12:55.600
Come on.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.100
You can do better than that.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.000
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.200
We're both gonna have to do
the best we can for who we are.

13:04.235 --> 13:05.600
And what does that mean?

13:05.635 --> 13:07.300
It means that...

13:07.335 --> 13:11.100
I am the skinny-but-intelligent

13:11.135 --> 13:15.400
son of a wealthy man who nearly
passes out at the thought of blood,

13:15.700 --> 13:18.600
and who has very minimal motor skills.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.900
And you are the troubled,
narcissistic underachiever

13:23.200 --> 13:24.800
who can do
just about anything,

13:24.835 --> 13:27.000
from throwing a ball
to wrapping a meat basket.

13:27.035 --> 13:29.400
And together,

13:29.700 --> 13:31.800
we have the potential
to make a pretty good dad.

13:31.835 --> 13:33.300
You're an idiot.

13:33.335 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, well, that's what
all my friends say. Heh.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.700
Thanks.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.800
Yeah.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
Hey, Adrian.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.600
Um, we all went out for coffee.
Did we miss anything?

13:55.635 --> 13:58.100
I don't think so.
No one's come to get me yet.

13:58.135 --> 14:00.400
Anyway, they said things
slowed down again.

14:00.435 --> 14:01.900
I brought coffee for you.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.400
And Ben and, um, Amy's dad,

14:04.435 --> 14:06.500
and an extra one
for anyone who wants it.

14:06.535 --> 14:07.700
That was nice of you.

14:07.735 --> 14:09.000
Thanks.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.400
How are you?

14:10.435 --> 14:11.600
I don't know.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.000
I guess I'm okay.

14:13.035 --> 14:14.400
I'm sure I'm doing
better than Amy.

14:14.435 --> 14:17.200
Yeah, but she's strong.
She'll be okay.

14:17.235 --> 14:18.600
So how's your brother?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.900
- He's my brother¡£
- So it wasn't any good?

14:21.935 --> 14:23.500
Heh.I knew it wouldn't be.

14:23.535 --> 14:25.700
I didn't come down here
because things with my brother

14:25.735 --> 14:28.200
didn't quite work out
the way I hoped.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.200
I'm here because I--

14:31.400 --> 14:33.100
I just wanted to be here
with everyone else.

14:33.135 --> 14:37.300
You know, I just feel like we're all
kind of connected by this baby now.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.900
By your baby.

14:38.935 --> 14:41.200
- Are you still jealous?
- Not tonight.

14:41.900 --> 14:45.900
But I'm sure I will be when I see you
hold your son for the first time.

14:45.935 --> 14:48.200
Look,
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.500
You didn't hurt me.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
I really care about you.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.900
And I just came over here
to tell you that.

14:55.935 --> 14:58.800
And to tell you that I know
you're gonna be a good dad.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.800
And I know you.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.300
I know you better than anyone.
And if you ever need me, call me.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.400
I'll be there for you.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.600
Always.

15:10.635 --> 15:13.200
What if I don't need you,
I just want you?

15:13.235 --> 15:15.900
Either way,
I'll be there for you.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.800
And you-- You be
there for your son.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.300
Always. Because it's not fun
growing up without a dad.

15:23.700 --> 15:24.700
I'll call you.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.300
I know you will.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.800
Hey, I'm just gonna go
say good night to Ricky.

15:31.835 --> 15:32.800
Okay.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.400
Hey.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.500
I just wanna tell you know,
I think we're gonna head out.

15:37.535 --> 15:40.100
It's late, and it could be a while,
and we all just kind of realize

15:40.135 --> 15:41.700
maybe this is just
for the family.

15:41.735 --> 15:42.500
I'll let Amy know.

15:42.535 --> 15:44.100
I'll be praying for her.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.700
And for you.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I got a really great time getting
to know you the past few months.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.700
I think a lot of you.

15:50.735 --> 15:52.300
I don't know why.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.100
I really didn't treat you right,
and I think I know why.

15:55.135 --> 15:57.500
- You don't have to explain.
- I wanna explain.

15:57.535 --> 15:59.600
I'm attracted to you,
and I respect you

15:59.635 --> 16:02.800
for livng what you believe
and not having sex before marriage.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.100
But Grace, I like having sex.

16:05.135 --> 16:07.000
I like having sex with Adrian.
I'm sorry.

16:07.035 --> 16:08.700
Don't apologize.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.800
I mean, I think there's a reason
you like having sex with Adrian

16:14.000 --> 16:15.800
I think you like Adrian.

16:15.835 --> 16:17.800
No, I think
you're in love with Adrian.

16:17.835 --> 16:19.400
And I don't know
how that will change

16:19.435 --> 16:21.600
as your relationship
with Amy changes but,

16:21.635 --> 16:24.200
I think you're in love Adrian,
whether you know it or not.

16:24.235 --> 16:26.800
And I know that Adrian's
in love with you.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.300
I also just wanted
to tell you that

16:29.335 --> 16:32.200
I'm thinking about getting
back together with Jack.

16:32.235 --> 16:33.600
You know, if he'll have me.

16:33.635 --> 16:35.400
And I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

16:35.435 --> 16:37.400
Well, as long as we're
being honest here,

16:37.435 --> 16:38.700
I still think you
could do better

16:38.735 --> 16:40.800
You just have
to get to know Jack.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.900
He's really nice.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.400
And we have a lot
in common, so...

16:46.300 --> 16:48.100
I should go.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.900
He's waiting for me.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.900
Night.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.500
You're gonna be great dad.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.000
I can't wait to see
you with the baby.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.099
I'm really proud of you,
you know that?

17:10.135 --> 17:11.400
Proud of me for what?

17:11.435 --> 17:16.400
I've been completely irresponsible
and relying on you for everything.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.900
Well,
that's what I'm proud of.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.400
You realized that,
and you're only 15.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.599
Of course, your girlfriend's
about to become a mother,

17:24.200 --> 17:26.000
so it's not a moment too soon.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.700
I am really and truly
in love with her you know¡£

17:29.735 --> 17:30.700
I know that.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.500
And that's why I've been
so hard on you.

17:32.535 --> 17:34.700
If you were going through all
this just because you liked her,

17:34.735 --> 17:36.500
I'd be worried about you.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.200
But you're like me.
When you commit, you commit

17:40.400 --> 17:43.700
You might not be a big guy,
but you got a big heart.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.100
- You get that from your mother.
- My mother and my father.

17:47.135 --> 17:48.100
I miss her.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.500
Yeah, me too.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.200
As much as you loved her, Dad,
she loved you too.

17:58.400 --> 18:03.399
And I think she'd be okay
if you dated again,

18:03.434 --> 18:04.500
if you wanted to.

18:04.535 --> 18:07.800
I can't imagine it.
Going out with another woman.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.500
Your mom,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.300
she was the love of my life.

18:11.335 --> 18:14.100
- And you don't get lonely?
- I get lonely.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.700
But I had such happiness
for so long.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.300
I feel like a lucky man.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.000
Some people never have
that kind of happiness.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.500
She was the one.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.300
And as young as you are,
I don't know,

18:29.335 --> 18:31.400
I think Amy's your one.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.900
It's a lot
to take on at 15, Ben.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.100
A girlfriend with a baby.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.400
But you'll do okay.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.300
It's not gonna be easy,
but you'll do okay.

18:45.335 --> 18:46.400
And I'm there for you, son.

18:46.435 --> 18:49.100
I know it doesn't seem
like it sometimes,

18:49.400 --> 18:50.900
but I'm there for you.

18:50.935 --> 18:52.300
Always.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.400
How can making out be so good
and sex so bad?

19:01.435 --> 19:03.700
- It wasn't so bad, was it?
- Yeah, Henry, it was.

19:03.735 --> 19:06.000
Well, maybe because
it was our first time.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.800
And no second time.

19:07.835 --> 19:09.400
Maybe because it was too soon,

19:09.435 --> 19:10.900
and we just thought there
wasn't anything left

19:10.935 --> 19:12.800
but going straight
to the finale.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.400
Maybe we needed to spend
more time doing this,

19:15.435 --> 19:18.300
because this is actually better
than any intercourse we ever had.

19:18.335 --> 19:21.100
Oh I hate that word.
It's so unromantic.

19:21.135 --> 19:22.600
It sounds like
health class, Alice.

19:22.635 --> 19:25.200
Shut up and kiss me.

19:27.300 --> 19:32.385
I can't believe you two made us
go to the hospital for nothing.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.400
You wanted to go.
So did Tammy.

19:34.435 --> 19:37.000
Yeah, to see the baby.

19:37.035 --> 19:40.200
Well, we'll see the baby
eventually.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.800
Do you mind
if I talk to Jack?

19:41.835 --> 19:51.900
Do I mind? Aren't I the one
who got you together with Jack?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.451
Good night.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.100
It was nice being
with you again.

20:01.135 --> 20:03.000
And it was nice being
with you again.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.200
Do you think we could be
boyfriend and girlfriend again?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.500
I mean, a lot of stuff has
happened since we broke up.

20:08.535 --> 20:10.265
Yeahd even before
we broke up.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.100
Grace,

20:12.300 --> 20:13.300
I love you.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.039
I've always loved you.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.800
But I don't know if that's enough.

20:16.835 --> 20:20.101
It might not be enough,
but it's a good place to start.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.500
I love you too, Jack.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.200
I still feel the same
as I did before about sex.

20:32.235 --> 20:34.180
I'm not ready to have sex.

20:34.215 --> 20:34.700
Not now.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.000
Not till you graduate
from med school?

20:36.200 --> 20:38.200
Well, honestly, I don't--

20:38.700 --> 20:40.702
I don't know if
I can wait that long.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.400
But...?

20:42.500 --> 20:43.700
We'll see. I just--

20:43.735 --> 20:45.400
I just wanna make
sure I'm ready to do it,

20:45.435 --> 20:47.800
and that might, or might not be,
until I get married.

20:47.835 --> 20:49.500
- I understand.
- Do you?

20:49.700 --> 20:52.100
Yeah, it's complicated. Sex.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.735
Yeah, it is. It's complicated.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.300
But I think we'll know
if and when it's right for us.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
* I *

21:02.035 --> 21:05.300
* Guess you say *

21:05.600 --> 21:10.300
* What can make me feel This way? *

21:10.700 --> 21:12.100
* My girl *

21:12.300 --> 21:14.400
* My girl *

21:14.600 --> 21:19.100
* Talking about my girl *

21:24.400 --> 21:25.300
We're almost there.

21:25.335 --> 21:26.300
Almost?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.400
So not a chance she could
die or something,isn't there?

21:28.435 --> 21:30.900
No, George, she'll be fine.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.300
I don't remember it taking this long.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.200
Did it take this long?

21:34.400 --> 21:35.700
Yeah, it took this long.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.100
Twelve hours.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
how much longer?

21:42.700 --> 21:43.600
Okay, we're there.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.300
We're at "push."
And Dad, if you wanna come in,

21:45.335 --> 21:46.500
you can stay above all the action.

21:46.535 --> 21:48.208
Amy says it's okay.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.700
Oh, come on, it's the four of us.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.400
We've made it this far together.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.900
Okay, Grandma, let's do it.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.300
Let's.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
We need to get cleaned up

26:44.835 --> 26:46.500
and back to the hospital
as soon as possible.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.900
Our things are all packed
in the truck.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.100
So, what do you wanna do?

26:52.400 --> 26:54.200
I guess this is as good a time as any

26:54.235 --> 26:56.014
to start our lives too.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.300
We won't be going far, Mom.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.800
Well, just remember you
have school tomorrow.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.000
Maybe this would be a good time
for me to start my life too.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.900
My life without school.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.100
Oh, no,

27:06.135 --> 27:07.300
not when you're living under my roof.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.284
Look, could we talk about this later?

27:09.400 --> 27:11.400
Right now I just need a shower,
get something to eat,

27:11.435 --> 27:12.900
and get back to the hospital.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.052
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
Goodbye, Mom.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.900
I'll see you at the hospital.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.200
Right.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
And you're okay with this?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.000
If you're okay with it.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.100
Bye.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.300
I'm gonna miss seeing you
wake up in the morning.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.400
And going to sleep at night.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.400
I'm really gonna miss you, Ashley.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.300
You're welcome to come home anytime.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
Tell her you love her.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.800
I love you.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.700
I love you too.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.300
I'll see you at the hospital, okay?

28:38.335 --> 28:39.300
Okay.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
Howdy, neighbor.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.000
I bought the house next door.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.700
You bought this house?

29:31.100 --> 29:32.100
This is where you're moving?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Afraid so.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.900
You're not angry, are you?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.500
Any other day, I think I might be,

29:36.535 --> 29:39.900
but, George, I actually think
it's kind of brilliant.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.400
I'll see you at the hospital.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.800
Oh, wait, we can all ride together.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.100
Carpool.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.000
Hang on to the MIuplicate keys.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.100
Yeah.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.600
- May I come in?
- Of course.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.300
Alone?

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
Yes.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.800
You broke his heart, you know.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.400
- Max?
- Yes, Max.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.500
He'll get over it.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.600
I mean, he's a nice guy and everything

30:15.635 --> 30:17.600
but he's not for me.

30:17.700 --> 30:18.700
He's your brother.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.825
Yeah, but even if he weren't my brother,

30:20.860 --> 30:22.408
he's still not for me.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.600
You didn't come over here

30:24.635 --> 30:26.100
to get us back together, did you?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.800
He's not, he's not in the car or anything?

30:27.900 --> 30:28.900
No, Adrian.

30:28.935 --> 30:30.000
That's not why I'm here.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.800
You're not taking me to military school.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.501
I'm not taking anyone.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.400
That was a threat my wife made to Max

30:36.435 --> 30:38.300
and I was obligated to uphold it.

30:38.335 --> 30:39.200
But he's not going?

30:39.235 --> 30:41.092
Not if I have anything to do with it.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.700
And I'm not going to be there anymore.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.300
I left.

30:46.335 --> 30:47.700
You left your wife?

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
And the boys.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.928
They're not boys.

30:50.963 --> 30:52.700
- They're men.
- I helped raise them.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.200
They're like my sons.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.100
And leaving for me is not easy.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.000
- You and my mom, you're not--
- No.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.300
Not right now anyway.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.900
What is it with you and women?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.600
I don't know.I think it's just

31:02.635 --> 31:05.197
I have this unresolved issue.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Named Adrian.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.500
You hungry?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.100
Yeah, I am.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.300
Let's go.

31:13.335 --> 31:14.700
unless you were expecting someone.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.700
Well, I'm always expecting someone.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.700
Ben, you haven't been home yet.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.100
Everyone else has gone home.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.100
It's okay. Go home.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.700
My mom and dad and Ashley
should be back soon.

31:33.735 --> 31:34.700
I don't wanna leave you alone.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.936
I wouldn't mind being left alone.

31:36.936 --> 31:38.300
I mean, it's okay if you wanna stay,

31:38.335 --> 31:40.792
but really, I'm exhausted.

31:40.792 --> 31:42.300
- I'll be fine.
- Is there anything

31:42.335 --> 31:43.400
I can do for you before I go?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.100
Get my school assignments tomorrow?

31:45.300 --> 31:47.000
If you want, I can
do your assignments.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.000
No,

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
you've done enough.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.300
You really have.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.700
Ben, thank you so much.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.300
For everything.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.900
For being with me,
for standing by me.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.400
- For everything.
- What else would I do?

32:04.200 --> 32:05.200
I love you, Amy.

32:05.900 --> 32:06.900
I love you too.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.600
All right, well,

32:11.635 --> 32:12.800
I guess I'll get out of here.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
Oh.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.500
What are you gonna name him?

32:16.900 --> 32:18.400
I don't know yet. I thought that

32:18.435 --> 32:19.800
a name would pop into mp head

32:19.835 --> 32:21.000
as soon as I saw his face,

32:21.035 --> 32:22.200
but I don't know.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.100
I don't even know
what his last name is.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
Is it my name?

32:25.435 --> 32:26.700
Is it Ricky's last name?

32:27.300 --> 32:28.700
Both our last names?

32:28.900 --> 32:30.567
Whatever you want his name to be,

32:30.567 --> 32:31.600
that'll be his name.

32:31.900 --> 32:32.800
We're here, we're here.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.500
Mom and Dad are just
parking the car.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.100
- Go home.
- I'm going.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.300
Bye, little guy.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
I love you.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.300
I hope you get some rest.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.800
-OK.
-Bye.

32:48.900 --> 32:49.800
So...

32:50.700 --> 32:52.100
how's my little nephew?

32:52.300 --> 32:53.300
What is his name?

32:53.900 --> 32:54.900
Know what?

32:56.100 --> 32:57.100
Why don't you name him?

32:57.135 --> 32:58.700
You're the one who talked
me into keeping him.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.300
Go ahead, Ashley,
you have the honor.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.700
Do it quickly before Mom
and Dad get here and wanna help.

33:03.735 --> 33:05.100
I may have talked you
into keeping him,

33:05.135 --> 33:06.600
but, hey,

33:06.635 --> 33:09.300
you're the one who's really
going to be keeping him, so...

33:13.900 --> 33:15.600
- John.
- I like John.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.200
Do we know a John? Why John?

33:18.235 --> 33:19.500
Goes with Juergens.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
John Juergens.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.700
Yeah.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.700
It goes with Boykewich as well.

33:24.735 --> 33:25.700
Yeah, go with John.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.700
You need a nice, clean, simple name.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.600
That kid's life will
be complicated enough.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.800
Yeah.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.200
A lot of green were named John too.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.100
John, uh-- John F. Kennedy.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.900
John Kennedy Jr.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.200
John Quincy Adams.

33:41.235 --> 33:42.900
- Pope John Paul.
- John Lennon.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.900
Uh, John Cougar Mellencamp.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.200
He dropped the Cougar.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.400
It's just John Mellencamp again,

33:47.435 --> 33:50.200
but you can do that
when your name is John.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.800
John, uh, Glenn.

33:52.835 --> 33:54.400
John Irving.

33:54.435 --> 33:56.200
- Johnny Cash.
- Johnny Rotten.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.500
- John Deere.
- John Boykehnch Juergs.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.200
Or John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.900
Or John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.000
That's my name.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.100
* John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt *

34:07.400 --> 34:09.500
* His name is my name too *

34:09.699 --> 34:12.100
* Whenever we go out
The people alway shout *

34:12.199 --> 34:14.400
* There goes John
Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt *

34:14.699 --> 34:16.500
Uh-oh. Amy, what are you
naming the baby?

34:16.600 --> 34:18.199
Not Jingleheimer Schmidt, I hope.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.199
- John.
- Aw.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.500
When can we take him home,mom?

34:21.699 --> 34:23.900
Tomorrow. They said you
can take him home tomorrow.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.500
I can't go home tomorrow.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.199
I'm gonna need at least
another week to get over this.

34:28.235 --> 34:29.300
Yeah, maybe a week,

34:29.500 --> 34:30.800
maybe weeks, maybe months,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.600
but, anyway, they said you
could take him home tomorrow.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.199
Okay, John.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.199
We're going home tomorrow.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.199
Ready or not.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.800
We are going home.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
What are you doing?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.800
I think heating up formula.

35:18.835 --> 35:19.800
Oh, not that way,

35:20.100 --> 35:21.700
no, that'll make it way too hot.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.600
Why just run another bottle
under the hot-water faucet.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.200
- Do you wanna do it?
- You can do it.

35:26.235 --> 35:27.800
And the doctor said the lactation nurse

35:27.835 --> 35:29.600
is gonna come by and
see you later this afternoon.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.800
Said she's sorry she missed
you at the hospital.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.100
What's she gonna do to me?

35:33.135 --> 35:34.900
She's gonna help you learn
how to breast-feed.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.800
Oh, come on. You should at least try.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.600
Can't you do it for me?

35:40.900 --> 35:42.300
I did do it for you.

35:42.700 --> 35:43.700
Now it's your turn.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.200
Oh, had David Johnson is gonna come by

35:48.235 --> 35:49.700
because I didn't want
to leave you to go to him.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.500
Wait. The architect?

35:51.535 --> 35:52.400
Mm-hm.

35:52.435 --> 35:54.000
You're working the day
after the baby's born?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.000
Don't you think that's a little soon?

35:56.035 --> 35:58.000
Amy, I don't get maternity leave.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.000
And I just got this job.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.700
Life goes on.

36:01.735 --> 36:03.000
Life does go on.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.200
Life is going on right now in my room.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.900
His name is John, and he doesn't care

36:09.935 --> 36:11.700
if his bottle goes in the microwave.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.300
And--

36:15.500 --> 36:16.600
I'm tired.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.400
Okay,Amy,why don't you go back to bed.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.023
I'll make this bottle for you.

36:21.023 --> 36:21.900
Thanks, Mom.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.400
I don't know why
I have to go to school now,

36:30.435 --> 36:31.500
I mean, it's almost noon.

36:31.535 --> 36:33.900
You got a half day off
to pick up your sister and nephew.

36:33.935 --> 36:36.000
Half a day's enough.
I don't wanna lose custody.

36:36.035 --> 36:37.200
Do you even have custody?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.300
Well, we're not
officially divorced yet.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.500
But I can tell you this:

36:40.700 --> 36:41.700
Your mother doesn't have custody

36:41.735 --> 36:43.200
of either one of us
right now. Ha-ha.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.500
You wanna go over and look at
John one more time before we leave?

36:54.400 --> 36:55.500
I don't believe this.

36:55.535 --> 36:56.500
Me neither.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.500
He's parking in the driveway
like he's family.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.500
So we still going in?

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
Not now.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.700
Oh, look, he's got a big teddy bear.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.100
He's ever had children.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.200
Parents don't buy
giant stuffed animals.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.900
They always come from people
who've never had children.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.200
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.600
Oh, look at that.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.300
That's so cute. Come on in.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.700
You know what?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.811
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

37:21.811 --> 37:23.600
- Let's go buy a bike.
- But I have a bike.

37:23.635 --> 37:25.000
Not you, me.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.500
I always wanted a motorcycle.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.700
Then you should get one.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.011
- Should I?
- Do we have any money?

37:30.011 --> 37:31.200
Money goes in circles.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.600
As it's circling
down the drain?

37:32.635 --> 37:35.100
I paid a little less for the house
than I thought I was going to pay.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.200
Then do it.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.700
Get the bike.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.000
- But I want a puppy.
- You got it.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.300
- Big dog.
- Giant.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.300
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful family.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.100
You, me, the dog, and the bike.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.800
We are in so much trouble.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.700
So you don't need me to do anything?

37:58.100 --> 37:59.600
No, I just came by to see you.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.500
So, how was it.

38:02.535 --> 38:03.800
Oh, horrible.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.100
And wonderful.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.300
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna get to experience that.

38:08.335 --> 38:10.000
I'll let you in on
a little sect,

38:10.035 --> 38:11.200
believe it or not, ha,

38:11.900 --> 38:14.500
I would actually like
to experience that again.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.200
With the right person, of course.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.500
- But I thought--
- That I couldn't have any more children?

38:19.600 --> 38:20.500
Isn't that what you said?

38:20.535 --> 38:22.000
I said that George and I couldn't have

38:22.035 --> 38:23.700
any more children after Ashley.

38:24.900 --> 38:25.900
George and I.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.600
George.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.600
Oh. But you could?

38:30.635 --> 38:31.600
With the right person.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
But we couldn't wait very long.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.800
Shouldn't we wait
till our third date

38:35.835 --> 38:37.000
to talk about that?

38:37.100 --> 38:39.600
About you and me
and babies and such?

38:39.700 --> 38:40.700
Yeah, that sounds good.

38:41.100 --> 38:43.200
Well, until then,
I just have to say...

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
...I adore you.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600
I'm not just saying that
because you slept with me

38:52.635 --> 38:53.900
- on our first date.
- Shh!

38:54.400 --> 38:57.000
Oh, we have to be quiet in front
of your daughter and her baby ?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.400
She's the good girl.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.300
You're a good girl too.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.400
Life goes on.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
Yep.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.500
Life goes on.

40:41.900 --> 40:42.900
So she's okay?

40:42.935 --> 40:44.100
Yeah, she's fine.

40:44.300 --> 40:45.400
And the baby's fine.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.500
What did she name him?

40:46.535 --> 40:47.500
John.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.000
I like that. That's classic.

40:49.035 --> 40:50.600
What are you gonna name your baby?

40:51.100 --> 40:53.542
I guess the cat's out of the bag
on that one now, huh?

40:53.542 --> 40:55.300
- Yup.
- So, what now?

40:55.600 --> 40:59.100
Well, I think I can now
safely transfer out of Band.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.400
And into P.E.?

41:00.800 --> 41:03.200
Oh. Do I have any other choices?

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
Home Economics.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.400
- Perfect.
- By the way,

41:06.435 --> 41:07.300
You get a life credit

41:07.335 --> 41:08.700
for your job at the butcher shop.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
No kidding? That's terrific.

41:11.300 --> 41:12.600
That's really working out.

41:12.635 --> 41:14.000
My dad's a really smart guy.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.200
And I think Ricky and I
are gonna make really good dads.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.000
- I hope so.
- I love her.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.700
And I love that baby.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.400
And I'm not gonna let Ricky
get in my way again.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.400
We're gonna be friends,
Ricky and me,

41:25.500 --> 41:28.400
and even if he's not capable
of being my friend,

41:28.435 --> 41:29.800
well, then, I'm gonna
go with the saying,

41:29.835 --> 41:32.100
"Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer."

41:32.400 --> 41:33.800
How old are you now, 40?

41:35.700 --> 41:37.500
I have grown up a little bit this year,

41:37.535 --> 41:38.500
don't you think?

41:40.700 --> 41:42.200
Even though I am still a virgin.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.100
Hi, John.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.900
Daddy's here.

42:21.300 --> 42:22.300
I love you.
