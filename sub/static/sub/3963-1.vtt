04:15.300 --> 04:16.718
Doug?

04:18.928 --> 04:21.430
Honey, are you all right?

04:23.475 --> 04:24.934
You're dreaming.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.314
Was it about Mars?

04:35.153 --> 04:36.821
Is that better?

04:39.532 --> 04:41.201
My poor baby.

04:42.285 --> 04:44.704
This is getting to be
an obsession.

04:52.879 --> 04:54.172
Was she there?

04:56.216 --> 04:57.634
Who?

04:59.678 --> 05:02.514
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

05:03.723 --> 05:04.975
Lori.

05:07.894 --> 05:10.855
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

05:11.564 --> 05:14.442
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.736
"Nobody"? What's her name?

05:16.820 --> 05:18.238
I don't know.

05:19.572 --> 05:21.324
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

05:21.408 --> 05:23.702
You better tell me!

05:23.785 --> 05:27.539
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

05:27.622 --> 05:30.333
And I'm always back
in the morning.

05:30.375 --> 05:31.835
Let me go!

05:34.379 --> 05:36.506
Come on, baby.

05:36.548 --> 05:39.592
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

05:39.676 --> 05:41.344
You mean it?

05:42.470 --> 05:44.389
You know I do.

05:53.857 --> 05:56.776
I'll give you
something to dream about.

06:06.745 --> 06:06.911
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

06:06.911 --> 06:10.498
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

06:10.582 --> 06:14.669
are our only defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.172
And more violence
last night on Mars...

06:17.255 --> 06:19.591
where terrorists
demanding independence...

06:19.633 --> 06:23.094
once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.268
Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade...

06:30.352 --> 06:32.395
claimed credit
for this latest bombing,

06:32.437 --> 06:35.732
which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

06:39.235 --> 06:42.697
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

06:42.781 --> 06:46.576
and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.

06:46.618 --> 06:48.119
No cameras!

06:48.203 --> 06:52.290
With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

06:52.374 --> 06:54.459
vowed that troops
would be used if necessary...

06:54.542 --> 06:58.380
to keep production
at full capacity.

06:58.463 --> 07:01.883
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

07:06.179 --> 07:08.473
- Lori.
- Doug?

07:08.515 --> 07:11.893
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

07:11.977 --> 07:13.395
Move to Mars.

07:14.479 --> 07:17.899
Why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

07:19.567 --> 07:20.986
Just think about it.

07:23.363 --> 07:26.741
We've been through this before.
You'd hate it on Mars.

07:26.825 --> 07:29.661
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

07:30.704 --> 07:34.833
I mean, really, a revolution
could break out there any second.

07:34.916 --> 07:36.835
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

07:38.086 --> 07:39.504
You believe him?

07:45.510 --> 07:47.804
Okay. Forget about it.

07:50.640 --> 07:55.186
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

07:55.270 --> 07:58.982
Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.

07:59.024 --> 08:00.984
It's absurd to think
we'd give it away...

08:01.026 --> 08:03.653
just because some lazy mutants
think they own the planet.

08:05.322 --> 08:08.283
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Any comment on the rumor...

08:08.366 --> 08:11.286
- Lori, move.
- that you've closed the Pyramid Mine...

08:11.369 --> 08:13.288
because you found
alien artifacts inside?

08:13.371 --> 08:16.374
There's a lot better places
than Mars.

08:16.416 --> 08:19.377
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

08:19.419 --> 08:23.423
I wish we could find some artifacts.
Our tourist industry could use a boost.

08:23.506 --> 08:26.051
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

08:26.134 --> 08:29.846
The fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

08:29.929 --> 08:32.015
to undermine trust
in the government.

08:32.097 --> 08:35.727
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

08:35.809 --> 08:39.481
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

08:39.563 --> 08:41.691
- What do you say?
- That's the news.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.693
- Stay tuned for weather.
- I'm late.

08:43.735 --> 08:45.320
But first, this.

08:46.780 --> 08:49.699
- Tonight, World Series Game Five...
- Sweetheart.

08:49.783 --> 08:51.201
Iive from Tokyo.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.999
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

08:59.918 --> 09:04.923
Don't you understand? I feel like
I was made for something more than this.

09:05.799 --> 09:09.761
I want to do something with my life,
to be somebody.

09:09.803 --> 09:11.805
You are somebody.

09:11.888 --> 09:14.015
You're the man I love.

09:18.603 --> 09:20.063
Bye.

09:22.607 --> 09:24.526
Have a nice day.

09:43.336 --> 09:46.339
You are now entering
a safety zone.

09:46.423 --> 09:50.802
No unauthorized weapons allowed
beyond this point.

10:01.187 --> 10:04.149
Would you like to ski...

10:04.232 --> 10:06.693
but you're snowed under
with work?

10:06.735 --> 10:10.780
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

10:10.864 --> 10:12.782
but you can't float the bill?

10:13.658 --> 10:17.120
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

10:18.663 --> 10:20.749
but now you're over the hill?

10:22.083 --> 10:24.002
Then come to Rekall lncorporated...

10:24.044 --> 10:27.130
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

10:27.213 --> 10:29.841
cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.

10:29.924 --> 10:32.677
So don't let life pass you by.

10:32.761 --> 10:36.348
Call Rekall
for the memory of a lifetime.

10:36.431 --> 10:40.352
For the memory of a lifetime

10:40.393 --> 10:43.813
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

11:02.624 --> 11:03.708
Harry.

11:07.128 --> 11:09.506
- You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

11:09.547 --> 11:11.508
Where they sell
those fake memories.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.051
Oh, Rekall.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.847
- Thinking of going there?
- Maybe.

11:17.931 --> 11:19.891
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

11:19.933 --> 11:24.479
A friend of mine tried it,
nearly got himself lobotomized.

11:25.146 --> 11:26.398
No shit?

11:26.481 --> 11:29.234
Don't fuck with your brain.
It ain't worth it.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.988
I guess not.

12:17.324 --> 12:19.743
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

12:19.784 --> 12:21.911
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

12:25.332 --> 12:26.791
- Bob?
- Yeah?

12:26.875 --> 12:29.919
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- I'll be right out.

12:31.004 --> 12:32.797
Just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

12:33.965 --> 12:35.425
Thank you.

12:44.017 --> 12:46.603
- Paul McClane. Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:46.645 --> 12:48.313
Come on in.

12:49.939 --> 12:52.150
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

12:53.234 --> 12:54.944
Help me out here, Doug.

12:55.028 --> 12:57.781
- You were interested in a memory of--
- Mars.

12:58.823 --> 13:00.492
Yeah. Mars.

13:00.575 --> 13:01.993
Is there a problem?

13:03.995 --> 13:05.664
To be perfectly honest...

13:05.747 --> 13:07.290
if you like outer space...

13:07.374 --> 13:11.920
you'd be happier with
one of our Saturn cruises.

13:12.003 --> 13:14.839
I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

13:15.674 --> 13:17.384
Okay. You're the boss.

13:18.468 --> 13:20.512
Mars it is.

13:21.221 --> 13:22.889
Now, let me see.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.016
The basic Mars package...

13:25.100 --> 13:28.436
will run you 899 credits.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.982
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

13:32.023 --> 13:35.527
A longer trip is more expensive
because it's a deeper implant.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.029
What's in the two-week package?

13:38.113 --> 13:41.658
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

13:42.826 --> 13:46.830
Private shuttle cabin, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

13:46.913 --> 13:49.207
Mount Pyramid,
the Grand Canals...

13:49.291 --> 13:51.793
and, of course, Venusville.

13:51.876 --> 13:53.712
But how real does it seem?

13:53.753 --> 13:58.008
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Don't bullshit me.

13:58.049 --> 14:01.011
I'm telling you, your brain
will not know the difference.

14:01.094 --> 14:03.138
That's guaranteed
or your money back.

14:03.221 --> 14:06.558
What about the guy you lobotomized?
Did he get a refund?

14:10.186 --> 14:12.230
You're talking ancient history.

14:12.314 --> 14:16.318
Nowadays traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

14:16.401 --> 14:18.320
Check out those statistics.

14:18.403 --> 14:22.073
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

14:22.157 --> 14:24.826
You got lost luggage,
lousy weather...

14:24.909 --> 14:26.870
crooked taxi drivers.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.164
When you travel with Rekall...

14:29.247 --> 14:32.250
everything is perfect.

14:32.334 --> 14:33.418
What do you say?

14:35.587 --> 14:38.423
- All right.
- Smart move.

14:38.465 --> 14:41.801
While you fill out
this questionnaire,

14:41.885 --> 14:44.387
I'll familiarize you
with some of our options.

14:44.471 --> 14:45.930
No options.

14:47.140 --> 14:50.518
Whatever you say.
Let me ask you one question.

14:51.353 --> 14:53.396
What is exactly the same...

14:53.438 --> 14:56.608
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

14:57.817 --> 14:58.943
I give up.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.780
You. You're the same.

15:01.821 --> 15:04.407
No matter where you go,
it's always you.

15:05.283 --> 15:07.827
Let me suggest
that you take a vacation...

15:07.911 --> 15:09.287
from yourself.

15:09.371 --> 15:10.956
I know, it sounds wild.

15:11.039 --> 15:13.959
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.211
I'm not interested.

15:16.294 --> 15:18.088
You're gonna love this, Doug.

15:18.129 --> 15:21.841
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

15:21.925 --> 15:25.470
Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as a playboy...

15:25.553 --> 15:27.430
or a famous jock or--

15:27.514 --> 15:28.598
"Secret agent."

15:28.682 --> 15:30.433
How much is that?

15:33.520 --> 15:35.897
Let me tantalize you.

15:35.981 --> 15:40.777
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

15:40.819 --> 15:43.446
People are trying to kill you.

15:43.488 --> 15:46.783
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

15:46.825 --> 15:47.951
Go on.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.662
I don't wanna spoil it for you...

15:50.745 --> 15:52.956
but by the time
the trip is over...

15:52.998 --> 15:57.002
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

15:57.085 --> 15:58.586
Now, you tell me.

15:58.670 --> 16:01.589
Isn't that worth
a measly 300 credits?

16:16.021 --> 16:17.230
Your first trip?

16:18.523 --> 16:21.484
Don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

16:22.694 --> 16:24.696
Good evening... Doug.

16:24.779 --> 16:27.157
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

16:27.198 --> 16:30.994
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.039
Would you like us to integrate
some alien stuff?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.041
Sure. Why not?

16:37.626 --> 16:39.044
Two-headed monsters?

16:39.127 --> 16:41.046
Don't you watch the news?

16:41.129 --> 16:44.674
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

16:44.758 --> 16:47.677
Yeah, they date back
a million years.

16:48.970 --> 16:50.722
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

16:50.764 --> 16:52.557
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

16:53.642 --> 16:56.102
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

16:56.186 --> 16:58.688
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

16:58.772 --> 17:01.524
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.526
Number seven.

17:03.568 --> 17:05.028
Ready for dreamland?

17:07.614 --> 17:11.742
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

17:11.826 --> 17:14.746
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself much more.

17:14.829 --> 17:17.707
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

17:23.171 --> 17:25.173
How do you like your women?

17:25.256 --> 17:28.218
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

17:29.052 --> 17:30.345
Brunette.

17:32.597 --> 17:36.559
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

17:39.980 --> 17:41.439
Athletic.

17:45.735 --> 17:49.614
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

17:49.698 --> 17:51.241
Be honest.

17:51.324 --> 17:52.742
Sleazy.

17:57.122 --> 17:58.373
Demure.

18:01.042 --> 18:02.460
41A, Ernie.

18:04.337 --> 18:06.423
Boy, is he gonna have
a wild time.

18:07.465 --> 18:10.969
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- That's for sure.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.283
So...

18:33.366 --> 18:35.285
what do you say?

18:35.327 --> 18:38.288
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

18:38.330 --> 18:43.752
Not true. We supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site...

18:43.835 --> 18:45.754
and even letters from--

18:49.090 --> 18:51.301
- What is it?
- Get down here.

18:51.384 --> 18:53.678
I am with
a very important client.

18:53.762 --> 18:56.181
Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.517
I'll be right back.

18:59.601 --> 19:00.685
Mr. McClane?

19:02.479 --> 19:04.189
Bob! What's wrong?

19:04.272 --> 19:06.191
Don't let her leave!

19:10.904 --> 19:12.697
Get off!

19:14.574 --> 19:16.326
You blew my cover!

19:16.409 --> 19:19.621
You can't do a simple
goddamn double implant?

19:19.704 --> 19:21.373
We hit a memory cap.

19:21.414 --> 19:23.750
They're coming!
They'll kill you all!

19:23.833 --> 19:26.544
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

19:26.628 --> 19:28.546
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

19:31.049 --> 19:32.968
My name is not Quaid.

19:33.051 --> 19:36.888
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

19:36.972 --> 19:39.474
- Hold him down!
- Let me go!

20:03.206 --> 20:05.458
Are you all right?

20:05.542 --> 20:08.670
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

20:08.753 --> 20:11.673
- He has really been there.
- Use your head.

20:11.756 --> 20:15.051
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

20:15.093 --> 20:17.053
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

20:17.095 --> 20:18.930
We haven't implanted it yet.

20:23.143 --> 20:24.394
Oh, shit.

20:26.021 --> 20:29.607
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

20:29.691 --> 20:30.942
Excuse me.

20:31.026 --> 20:32.777
"Someone"?

20:32.861 --> 20:34.779
We're talking about the Agency.

20:34.863 --> 20:37.574
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

20:40.035 --> 20:43.622
Renata, cover up any memory he's got
of us or Rekall.

20:43.705 --> 20:45.915
I'll try.
It's pretty messy in there.

20:45.999 --> 20:49.252
Ernie, dump him in a cab.
Tiffany, you help him.

20:49.294 --> 20:52.297
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

20:52.380 --> 20:55.717
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

21:10.148 --> 21:11.566
Where am l?

21:13.902 --> 21:15.820
You're in a Johnnycab.

21:15.904 --> 21:17.489
What am I doing here?

21:17.572 --> 21:21.076
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

21:21.159 --> 21:23.203
How did I get in this taxi?

21:23.286 --> 21:25.830
The door opened, you got in.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.543
Hell of a day, isn't it?

21:44.224 --> 21:46.184
- This okay?
- Right here.

21:46.226 --> 21:48.937
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

21:49.020 --> 21:51.481
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

21:51.564 --> 21:53.024
Hey, Quaid.

21:53.692 --> 21:56.528
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

21:56.569 --> 21:59.656
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

22:00.740 --> 22:02.951
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

22:03.034 --> 22:06.496
- I told you not to, but you went.
- What are you, my father?

22:08.039 --> 22:11.293
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Thank you. I'm already late--

22:13.211 --> 22:16.172
Okay, bring him--
Come on, move it!

22:16.256 --> 22:18.508
Let's go get that drink.
Move it!

22:18.550 --> 22:22.012
What is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

22:22.095 --> 22:25.181
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

22:25.223 --> 22:28.476
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

22:28.560 --> 22:32.022
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

22:35.233 --> 22:39.070
You're making a big mistake.
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

22:39.112 --> 22:41.573
You got yourself mixed up with--

23:31.915 --> 23:34.584
And pivot... and serve...

23:34.626 --> 23:37.128
and shift... and stroke...

23:42.509 --> 23:44.594
Very good.
Perfect form.

23:48.139 --> 23:49.557
Hi, honey.

23:51.476 --> 23:54.813
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

23:54.896 --> 23:56.481
Muggers?
Are you all right?

23:56.564 --> 23:58.608
No, they were spies or something.

23:58.650 --> 24:01.403
Harry, from work, he was the--
Get down!

24:01.486 --> 24:05.448
- Harry was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

24:05.490 --> 24:09.452
- Why would spies want to kill you?
- I don't know.

24:09.494 --> 24:12.956
- It had something to do with Mars.
- You've never been to Mars.

24:12.998 --> 24:16.334
It sounds crazy, but I went to
this Rekall place after work--

24:16.418 --> 24:18.837
- Those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.133
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

24:23.174 --> 24:26.636
Forget about Rekall.
They were going to kill me.

24:26.678 --> 24:29.681
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

24:29.764 --> 24:31.808
But I killed them.

24:33.685 --> 24:38.315
Listen, sweetheart. Those assholes
at Rekall have fucked up your mind.

24:38.398 --> 24:40.692
You're having paranoid delusions.

24:40.775 --> 24:43.194
You call this a delusion?

24:51.870 --> 24:55.957
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

25:24.235 --> 25:26.696
Lori, go! Get out!

26:17.998 --> 26:19.457
Why are you doing this?

26:36.266 --> 26:37.517
Talk!

26:37.600 --> 26:39.686
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

26:39.769 --> 26:41.771
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

26:41.813 --> 26:44.441
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

26:44.524 --> 26:47.319
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

26:47.402 --> 26:48.820
It was an Agency implant.

26:48.903 --> 26:50.488
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

26:50.572 --> 26:54.451
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted?

26:54.534 --> 26:57.454
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

26:57.495 --> 26:58.955
Bullshit.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.252
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

27:04.336 --> 27:08.548
I was written in as your wife
so I could make sure the erasure took.

27:14.387 --> 27:15.513
Sorry, Quaid.

27:15.555 --> 27:17.766
Your whole life
is just a dream.

27:20.477 --> 27:24.773
Okay, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am l?

27:24.856 --> 27:25.982
Beats me.

27:27.317 --> 27:29.235
I just work here.

27:37.744 --> 27:40.121
There's something
I want you to know.

27:41.706 --> 27:45.794
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

27:45.877 --> 27:47.504
I'm honored.

27:47.545 --> 27:51.508
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

27:52.676 --> 27:55.804
If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

27:57.681 --> 28:01.643
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

28:06.898 --> 28:08.191
Clever girl.

28:10.735 --> 28:14.656
You wouldn't shoot me, Doug,
after all we've been through.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.659
Some of it was fun.

28:20.578 --> 28:22.205
Nice knowing you.

28:56.948 --> 28:58.074
Don't touch her.

28:59.159 --> 29:00.243
Nobody here.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.373
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

29:05.457 --> 29:08.084
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

29:08.168 --> 29:09.753
I've got him.

29:23.475 --> 29:25.935
He's going for the subway.
Let's go.

29:26.019 --> 29:27.979
Let's go. Move it.

29:41.242 --> 29:44.204
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

29:44.245 --> 29:46.164
What if they bring him back?

29:47.248 --> 29:48.667
Not a chance.

29:57.676 --> 29:59.135
Subway! Go!

30:09.813 --> 30:12.190
Get him!
He's got a gun!

30:12.899 --> 30:15.986
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

30:16.069 --> 30:17.362
Hold it!

30:49.394 --> 30:50.478
The escalator.

30:50.562 --> 30:52.981
You four go up.
You come with me.

31:07.871 --> 31:09.539
Get out of the way!

31:12.250 --> 31:13.710
Move!

31:44.449 --> 31:45.742
The platform!

31:49.537 --> 31:51.456
- Which way?
- To the right.

32:18.566 --> 32:22.237
Botco.
Tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

32:22.988 --> 32:25.991
Don't settle for pale memories
or fake implants.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.535
Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way...

32:28.618 --> 32:31.913
on a real, live holiday
you can afford.

32:37.961 --> 32:39.879
I want that fucker dead.

32:39.963 --> 32:43.174
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want
Quaid porking my old lady.

32:43.258 --> 32:48.179
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute.

32:48.972 --> 32:53.268
Six-beta-nine, we have a live
transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

32:54.352 --> 32:57.022
- Richter here.
- Patch it through.

32:57.105 --> 33:00.650
- What is going on?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

33:00.734 --> 33:03.361
I want him alive, you moron.

33:03.445 --> 33:05.655
No. He knows too much.

33:07.198 --> 33:09.200
Lori says
he can't remember anything.

33:09.284 --> 33:11.828
In an hour
he could have total recall.

33:11.911 --> 33:16.541
Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for reimplantation.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.168
Have you got that?

33:18.209 --> 33:21.296
I want him back in place
with Lori.

33:22.422 --> 33:23.882
Did you hear me?

33:24.924 --> 33:27.510
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

33:27.594 --> 33:29.638
I got Quaid again.

33:29.721 --> 33:32.932
Switching to another channel.
I've got sunspots.

33:34.893 --> 33:37.062
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

33:37.145 --> 33:40.023
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

33:40.106 --> 33:42.484
We should've killed Quaid
on Mars.

34:07.550 --> 34:09.094
- How we doing?
- Fine.

34:12.054 --> 34:13.848
Zooming in.

34:13.931 --> 34:15.016
We got him!

34:36.121 --> 34:38.415
If you want to live,
don't hang up.

34:38.456 --> 34:40.417
- What do you want?
- You've been bugged.

34:40.458 --> 34:44.795
They'll be there in three minutes
unless you do as I say.

34:44.879 --> 34:47.799
Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.762
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

34:52.804 --> 34:55.849
Wrap a wet towel around your head.
That'll muffle the signal.

34:55.931 --> 34:58.852
- How'd you find me?
- I'd advise you to hurry.

35:01.604 --> 35:05.025
This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.

35:13.617 --> 35:15.285
- Shit!
- What?

35:15.368 --> 35:17.871
- I lost him.
- Well, find him!

35:17.954 --> 35:19.497
Yeah, right.

35:19.581 --> 35:21.499
Hurry up.
You look beautiful.

35:24.461 --> 35:27.672
Now go to the window.
Go.

35:30.634 --> 35:32.844
Can you see me down here?

35:32.886 --> 35:36.181
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

35:36.222 --> 35:39.684
I'm gonna set it here.
Come and get it, keep moving.

35:39.768 --> 35:41.811
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

35:41.895 --> 35:45.440
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency on Mars.

35:45.523 --> 35:48.985
You asked me, if you disappeared,
to find you, so here I am.

35:49.069 --> 35:51.529
What was I doing on Mars?

35:55.909 --> 35:57.953
Excuse me, but this is mine.

35:58.036 --> 36:01.206
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

36:01.289 --> 36:04.125
- Find your own bag.
- I need it!

36:05.335 --> 36:07.128
Fuck you, you asshole!

36:16.638 --> 36:18.556
He's gotta be around here
somewhere.

36:22.435 --> 36:23.561
That guy there.

36:33.405 --> 36:36.992
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

36:38.410 --> 36:40.704
Drive. Drive!

36:40.787 --> 36:44.082
- Please repeat the destination.
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

36:44.124 --> 36:46.084
Please state the street
and number.

36:46.126 --> 36:48.253
Shit. Shit!

36:48.336 --> 36:52.048
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat--

36:59.597 --> 37:01.224
Fasten your seat belt!

37:34.799 --> 37:36.760
The fare is 18 credits, please.

37:36.843 --> 37:38.303
Sue me, dickhead.

37:48.313 --> 37:50.774
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

39:25.869 --> 39:28.246
Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.666
If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself...

39:31.750 --> 39:34.836
and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

39:34.919 --> 39:38.381
Whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

39:39.633 --> 39:42.927
You are not you.
You are me.

39:43.762 --> 39:45.597
No shit.

39:47.515 --> 39:50.101
Six-beta-nine,
six-beta-nine, come in.

39:50.185 --> 39:51.603
Did you find him?

39:51.645 --> 39:54.606
We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.

39:55.482 --> 39:58.276
Send two units.
We'll meet you there.

40:02.656 --> 40:05.575
All my life I've worked
for Mars intelligence.

40:05.659 --> 40:07.744
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

40:07.827 --> 40:10.747
But recently I met somebody--
a woman--

40:10.830 --> 40:12.749
and I learned a few things.

40:12.832 --> 40:15.627
I've been playing
for the wrong team.

40:16.795 --> 40:20.674
All I can do now is try
to make up for it.

40:20.715 --> 40:24.052
There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.

40:24.135 --> 40:28.348
But if you're listening to this,
that means he has got to me first.

40:29.182 --> 40:31.101
Here comes the hard part.

40:31.184 --> 40:33.353
Now it is all up to you.

40:33.436 --> 40:34.688
Great.

40:46.408 --> 40:48.410
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

40:48.493 --> 40:50.912
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

40:50.996 --> 40:52.455
Find him.

40:52.539 --> 40:55.458
First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.

40:55.542 --> 40:59.337
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

40:59.379 --> 41:01.423
Don't worry.
It's self-guiding.

41:07.387 --> 41:09.514
Just shove real hard.

41:15.395 --> 41:17.188
When it crunches, you're there.

41:18.773 --> 41:20.525
Just pull it out.

41:20.609 --> 41:23.028
Be careful.
It's my head too.

41:44.841 --> 41:46.760
I've got a lock.

41:46.843 --> 41:48.261
Up. Let's go.

41:50.472 --> 41:52.182
This is the plan.

41:52.265 --> 41:53.892
Get your ass to Mars...

41:53.975 --> 41:57.354
go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.

41:57.437 --> 41:59.189
That's it.

41:59.272 --> 42:05.111
Just do what I say and we can nail
that bastard who fucked you and me.

42:05.153 --> 42:07.238
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.032
Don't let me down.

42:38.019 --> 42:39.104
Straight ahead.

42:43.108 --> 42:44.526
In there.

42:52.993 --> 42:54.452
There!

43:12.679 --> 43:13.596
Give me that.

43:19.185 --> 43:20.312
Shit.

43:21.730 --> 43:24.941
Get your ass to Mars--
Get your ass to Mars--

44:00.060 --> 44:01.978
Welcome to the Mars
Federal Colony.

44:02.062 --> 44:04.981
For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed...

44:05.065 --> 44:07.192
to protect you
from the vacuum outside.

44:07.275 --> 44:10.862
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

44:10.946 --> 44:15.241
Air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.

44:15.283 --> 44:16.368
Next.

44:17.577 --> 44:20.664
Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.

44:20.747 --> 44:22.165
Passport.

44:35.303 --> 44:37.263
- Get out of the way.
- Make way!

44:37.347 --> 44:39.182
Stand back.

44:45.230 --> 44:47.857
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

44:48.942 --> 44:50.568
Any news of Quaid?

44:50.610 --> 44:53.571
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.

44:54.739 --> 44:58.410
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

44:58.493 --> 45:00.704
Look at that shit.

45:00.787 --> 45:04.332
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

45:04.416 --> 45:06.584
They think
he's fuckin' George Washington.

45:06.668 --> 45:08.420
Kill the bastard.

45:08.461 --> 45:10.255
Nobody knows who he is.

45:11.840 --> 45:14.217
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

45:14.843 --> 45:16.219
Two weeks.

45:17.053 --> 45:18.138
Excuse me?

45:19.597 --> 45:21.516
Two weeks.

45:28.523 --> 45:30.775
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

45:30.817 --> 45:33.320
The rebels took over
the refinery last night.

45:33.361 --> 45:35.071
No terbinium is going out.

45:35.155 --> 45:37.115
And it gets worse.

45:57.552 --> 45:58.928
Quaid.

46:00.055 --> 46:01.514
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

46:01.598 --> 46:03.475
The woman!
Get him-- her!

46:04.392 --> 46:06.102
Arrest that woman!

46:06.186 --> 46:07.646
Grab her!

46:37.300 --> 46:38.510
Catch!

46:40.595 --> 46:42.847
Get ready for a surprise!

47:53.668 --> 47:55.629
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

47:55.712 --> 47:57.088
Open it!

47:57.130 --> 47:58.882
They're all connected!

48:08.850 --> 48:11.811
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

48:11.853 --> 48:15.190
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth cares about Mars.

48:15.273 --> 48:18.193
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

48:18.276 --> 48:20.236
Excuse me. What's that?

48:20.320 --> 48:22.447
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

48:22.530 --> 48:26.076
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

48:26.159 --> 48:28.620
Well, that's a rumor,
isn't it?

48:28.662 --> 48:30.163
Think so?

48:59.651 --> 49:01.152
Mr. Cohaagen.

49:08.410 --> 49:10.370
You wanted to see me, sir?

49:13.957 --> 49:15.375
Richter...

49:16.584 --> 49:18.837
do you know why I'm so happy?

49:18.920 --> 49:20.380
No, sir.

49:22.215 --> 49:25.677
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

49:25.760 --> 49:29.848
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

49:29.931 --> 49:31.391
Anything.

49:32.809 --> 49:34.519
In fact...

49:34.561 --> 49:37.856
my only worry
is that one day...

49:37.897 --> 49:40.191
if the rebels win...

49:40.233 --> 49:42.819
it all might end...

49:42.902 --> 49:44.487
and you're making it happen!

49:45.405 --> 49:48.408
First you try to kill Quaid,
then he escapes.

49:48.450 --> 49:50.744
He had help from our side, sir.

49:51.953 --> 49:53.163
I know that.

49:55.248 --> 49:57.584
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

49:57.626 --> 50:00.712
I don't give you enough information
to think.

50:02.255 --> 50:05.925
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

50:08.094 --> 50:09.387
Yes, sir.

50:14.768 --> 50:16.353
Let's get to business.

50:18.063 --> 50:20.440
We've got
a tricky situation here.

50:20.482 --> 50:22.859
Kuato wants
what's in Quaid's head.

50:24.194 --> 50:27.530
He might be able to get it.
They say he's psychic.

50:28.949 --> 50:31.868
I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

50:35.288 --> 50:37.248
Suppose you could play along?

50:37.290 --> 50:39.417
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

50:39.501 --> 50:41.962
Otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

51:00.105 --> 51:04.234
You need a taxi?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

51:04.317 --> 51:06.736
You need a cab?
Come on!

51:32.345 --> 51:33.805
Can I help you?

51:33.847 --> 51:36.433
I would like a room, please.

51:41.521 --> 51:44.482
Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

51:44.566 --> 51:45.942
Definitely.

51:48.194 --> 51:50.280
You've left something in our safe.

51:50.363 --> 51:51.281
Could you get it?

51:57.579 --> 51:59.164
Identification?

52:08.506 --> 52:10.925
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.695
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

52:30.737 --> 52:33.239
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

52:45.293 --> 52:46.544
Thank you.

52:51.758 --> 52:54.260
Hey, man, you need a cab?

52:54.344 --> 52:58.807
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

52:58.890 --> 53:01.309
- Where's yours?
- Right over there.

53:03.645 --> 53:06.398
Hey, asshole!
That's my fare!

53:06.481 --> 53:07.857
Eat this!

53:07.941 --> 53:09.276
Damn you, Benny!

53:15.448 --> 53:17.075
Welcome to Mars, man!

53:21.288 --> 53:24.874
- What was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels.

53:24.958 --> 53:26.418
Let's get outta here...

53:26.459 --> 53:28.378
before they arrest us!

53:28.461 --> 53:30.714
What do the rebels want?

53:30.755 --> 53:33.758
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

53:38.805 --> 53:40.098
So, where to?

53:40.181 --> 53:41.975
Last Resort.

53:42.017 --> 53:44.060
You're getting off
to an early start.

53:44.978 --> 53:47.230
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

53:47.314 --> 53:49.149
Well, actually, no.

53:49.232 --> 53:50.984
Well, sort of.

53:51.067 --> 53:55.071
The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

54:05.457 --> 54:07.876
Voila. Venusville.

54:09.169 --> 54:11.463
Hey, you see anything you like?

54:15.508 --> 54:18.845
End of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

54:18.887 --> 54:20.805
I'll show you where.

54:20.889 --> 54:24.643
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

54:24.726 --> 54:28.480
It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

54:28.521 --> 54:30.482
They got everything.

54:33.026 --> 54:34.986
Not bad, huh?

54:36.446 --> 54:40.325
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

54:41.076 --> 54:43.161
I bet I can guess
your birthday.

54:43.244 --> 54:46.206
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

54:48.875 --> 54:51.169
- Tell me, are all psychics--
- Freaks?

54:51.252 --> 54:53.296
Afraid so.
It goes with the territory.

54:53.380 --> 54:58.551
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

54:58.635 --> 55:02.639
This is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

55:02.722 --> 55:05.850
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

55:05.934 --> 55:08.895
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down--

55:08.937 --> 55:11.189
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

55:11.273 --> 55:14.192
Hey, man,
I got five kids to feed.

55:14.276 --> 55:16.194
Take them to the dentist.

55:16.236 --> 55:18.738
Thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

55:18.822 --> 55:21.199
Take your time.
Benny's the name.

55:41.094 --> 55:43.179
- What do you want?
- Melina.

55:43.263 --> 55:45.015
She's busy.

55:45.098 --> 55:47.183
But Mary here, she's free.

55:47.225 --> 55:50.687
Well, not free, honey, but...

55:51.396 --> 55:52.606
available.

55:55.775 --> 55:58.111
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

55:58.194 --> 55:59.446
Earth slime.

55:59.487 --> 56:02.198
Thing is, friend,
Mel's real picky.

56:02.282 --> 56:04.409
She sticks to her regulars.

56:04.492 --> 56:06.453
She'll like me.

56:07.579 --> 56:08.955
Mel!

56:46.660 --> 56:47.953
Hello, Hauser.

56:48.995 --> 56:50.956
Still bulging, I see.

56:52.415 --> 56:55.669
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

56:57.629 --> 56:59.547
I think it's still hungry.

57:01.925 --> 57:04.970
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

57:05.053 --> 57:07.097
Look who's talking.

57:07.180 --> 57:09.975
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

57:10.058 --> 57:12.394
Relax. You'll live longer.

57:12.477 --> 57:13.895
Come on.

57:19.526 --> 57:23.154
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

57:23.238 --> 57:26.199
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

57:41.047 --> 57:43.133
You son of a bitch.

57:43.174 --> 57:45.802
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

57:45.885 --> 57:47.721
Well, I guess he didn't.

57:47.804 --> 57:51.641
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

57:59.232 --> 58:01.526
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

58:02.652 --> 58:04.988
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

58:06.990 --> 58:09.868
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

58:09.909 --> 58:13.538
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

58:13.622 --> 58:15.749
I don't remember you.

58:15.832 --> 58:19.294
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

58:21.379 --> 58:23.798
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

58:23.882 --> 58:26.259
- Hauser left me a note.
- You're Hauser.

58:26.343 --> 58:28.261
Not anymore.

58:28.345 --> 58:31.473
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

58:34.643 --> 58:38.688
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- No, Cohaagen stole it.

58:38.772 --> 58:43.360
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

58:43.443 --> 58:44.861
This is too weird.

58:44.945 --> 58:47.572
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job--

58:47.614 --> 58:50.575
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

58:50.617 --> 58:52.619
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

58:52.702 --> 58:55.330
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

58:55.413 --> 58:58.124
- Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

58:58.166 --> 59:01.962
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

59:02.963 --> 59:06.383
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

59:06.424 --> 59:09.052
Don't be ridiculous.

59:11.638 --> 59:13.890
You never loved me, Hauser.

59:13.974 --> 59:15.934
You just used me to get inside.

59:16.017 --> 59:17.936
Inside what?

59:22.065 --> 59:24.109
I think you'd better leave.

59:24.192 --> 59:27.445
-Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
-I'm not falling for it.

59:27.529 --> 59:29.698
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

59:29.781 --> 59:31.700
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

59:31.783 --> 59:33.910
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

59:33.994 --> 59:35.912
People are trying to kill me.

59:36.788 --> 59:38.456
Really?

59:40.792 --> 59:42.877
All right, I'm leaving.

59:54.889 --> 59:57.851
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

59:57.892 --> 01:00:00.645
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

01:00:00.687 --> 01:00:03.106
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

01:00:03.189 --> 01:00:05.609
Hey, that didn't take long.

01:00:05.692 --> 01:00:08.278
Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:10.822
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

01:00:10.864 --> 01:00:13.491
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:23.293
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

01:00:23.293 --> 01:00:27.005
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

01:00:27.088 --> 01:00:29.424
throughout the Mars federal colony.

01:00:29.507 --> 01:00:34.095
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

01:00:34.179 --> 01:00:36.348
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
must understand...

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:39.893
that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering--

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.731
Mr. Quaid?

01:00:45.482 --> 01:00:46.733
What?

01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:49.152
I need to talk to you
about Mr. Hauser.

01:00:50.362 --> 01:00:52.697
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

01:00:52.739 --> 01:00:55.075
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

01:00:55.158 --> 01:00:58.036
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

01:00:59.746 --> 01:01:02.749
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:08.088
- What do you want?
- This will be hard for you to accept.

01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:11.675
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

01:01:13.343 --> 01:01:16.554
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:19.933
You're not here
and neither am I.

01:01:20.016 --> 01:01:21.268
That's amazing.

01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:24.437
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:26.439
You're strapped into
an implant chair...

01:01:26.523 --> 01:01:29.442
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:33.071
Ah, I get it.
I'm dreaming.

01:01:33.113 --> 01:01:36.491
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

01:01:36.574 --> 01:01:37.993
Not exactly.

01:01:38.076 --> 01:01:42.205
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes...

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:44.874
but you're inventing it
yourself as you go along.

01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:49.754
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

01:01:49.796 --> 01:01:53.758
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.137
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.597
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy...

01:01:59.639 --> 01:02:02.726
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:04.728
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

01:02:06.187 --> 01:02:10.317
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.819
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

01:02:12.902 --> 01:02:17.407
the suite at the Hilton-- are elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:19.909
You paid to be a secret agent.

01:02:19.993 --> 01:02:22.454
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

01:02:22.537 --> 01:02:25.123
And what about the girl?

01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:27.959
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

01:02:28.043 --> 01:02:30.587
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:34.299
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

01:02:34.341 --> 01:02:36.426
Mr. Quaid.

01:02:36.509 --> 01:02:40.555
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:43.642
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

01:02:43.725 --> 01:02:46.186
Would you mind opening the door?

01:02:48.146 --> 01:02:50.523
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

01:02:50.607 --> 01:02:52.442
I'll do it.

01:02:59.032 --> 01:03:00.283
Sweetheart?

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:04.913
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:12.045
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here...

01:03:12.128 --> 01:03:14.798
at Rekall.

01:03:18.551 --> 01:03:20.220
I love you.

01:03:20.303 --> 01:03:23.682
Right. That's why
you tried to kill me.

01:03:23.723 --> 01:03:27.769
No. I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

01:03:27.852 --> 01:03:30.188
I want you to come back to me.

01:03:32.315 --> 01:03:35.568
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

01:03:35.652 --> 01:03:40.240
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?

01:03:40.323 --> 01:03:44.286
Or that you're really
an invincible secret agent from Mars...

01:03:44.369 --> 01:03:48.581
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think...

01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:50.625
he's a lowly construction worker?

01:03:58.216 --> 01:04:00.552
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

01:04:00.593 --> 01:04:03.555
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

01:04:05.098 --> 01:04:07.058
Your whole life is ahead of you.

01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:11.688
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.693
Let's assume I do.
Then what?

01:04:19.529 --> 01:04:22.616
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

01:04:22.699 --> 01:04:26.536
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.039
Inside your dream,
you'll fall asleep.

01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:37.172
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

01:04:37.255 --> 01:04:39.924
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

01:04:40.008 --> 01:04:43.094
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

01:04:43.136 --> 01:04:47.641
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

01:04:47.724 --> 01:04:51.144
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:53.438
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:55.982
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:59.486
One minute you'll be the savior of
the rebel cause, and right after that...

01:04:59.569 --> 01:05:01.738
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

01:05:01.821 --> 01:05:05.742
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilizations, as you requested...

01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:08.536
but in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:14.542
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

01:05:20.507 --> 01:05:23.760
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

01:05:28.515 --> 01:05:30.684
Swallow it!

01:05:33.144 --> 01:05:35.689
Go ahead, sweetheart.

01:05:58.378 --> 01:06:01.715
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

01:06:22.569 --> 01:06:25.030
That's for making me come to Mars.

01:06:26.323 --> 01:06:29.242
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:32.912
Cuff him.

01:06:39.544 --> 01:06:42.922
-I got him.
-Bring him down in the service elevator.

01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:46.635
Let's go.

01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.209
Fuck you!

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:13.013
Doug.

01:08:14.931 --> 01:08:17.017
Honey...

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.685
you wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

01:08:21.438 --> 01:08:24.733
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

01:08:24.816 --> 01:08:26.901
After all, we're married.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:33.908
Consider that a divorce.

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:38.078
That was your wife?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.417
What a bitch.

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.636
Hey, get out of the way!

01:08:56.096 --> 01:08:58.683
I thought you didn't like me.

01:08:58.725 --> 01:09:01.685
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be okay.

01:09:01.728 --> 01:09:05.064
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologize.

01:09:05.148 --> 01:09:07.192
Kuato wants to see you.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.403
Come on.

01:09:38.848 --> 01:09:40.433
- Now what?
- Jump!

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.967
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

01:10:17.512 --> 01:10:20.807
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

01:10:32.902 --> 01:10:33.987
Move!

01:10:36.072 --> 01:10:37.907
Taxi!

01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:40.827
Melina! Melina!

01:10:43.955 --> 01:10:45.540
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort.

01:10:45.624 --> 01:10:47.125
You guys are going in circles.

01:10:52.172 --> 01:10:53.173
Jesus!

01:10:53.256 --> 01:10:55.467
Come on! You drive!

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:56.676
You guys are in trouble?

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.345
Go! Go!

01:11:09.272 --> 01:11:12.192
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

01:11:12.275 --> 01:11:14.527
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

01:11:48.561 --> 01:11:49.729
Shit!

01:11:49.813 --> 01:11:51.648
No brakes!

01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:53.358
You idiot!

01:11:56.569 --> 01:11:57.570
What are you doing?

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:13.169
Christ! Now they're after me!

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:15.797
Give me that!

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.632
Get out of the way!

01:12:24.431 --> 01:12:25.682
Tony!

01:12:29.394 --> 01:12:31.771
Get out of the way!
Come on!

01:12:31.855 --> 01:12:34.357
Come on! Come on!

01:12:37.652 --> 01:12:39.112
Thank you, Tony.

01:13:04.054 --> 01:13:06.222
You wanna have some fun?

01:13:06.306 --> 01:13:07.474
Where are they?

01:13:07.557 --> 01:13:10.268
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.111
Maybe you know.

01:13:26.993 --> 01:13:28.662
Kill them all!

01:13:42.842 --> 01:13:43.927
Thumbelina!

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.662
Richter!

01:14:10.704 --> 01:14:13.915
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

01:14:13.999 --> 01:14:17.002
- We've got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

01:14:17.043 --> 01:14:18.962
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.383
Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.

01:14:23.466 --> 01:14:25.010
Don't think.

01:14:25.135 --> 01:14:27.887
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:29.639
Pull 'em out.

01:14:29.723 --> 01:14:32.058
Everybody, pull out!

01:14:32.142 --> 01:14:33.727
Move!

01:14:42.777 --> 01:14:45.697
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.261
The first settlers
are buried here.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:53.306
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:56.184
He built cheap domes and watched
the kids turn into freaks.

01:15:56.268 --> 01:15:57.519
I saw them.

01:15:57.602 --> 01:16:00.313
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

01:16:00.397 --> 01:16:01.982
Maybe you can change all that.

01:16:02.065 --> 01:16:06.319
Hey, I think my grandpa
might be here.

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:07.988
So what can I do?

01:16:08.071 --> 01:16:10.699
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

01:16:10.782 --> 01:16:13.535
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

01:16:13.618 --> 01:16:16.621
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

01:16:17.872 --> 01:16:19.874
Since when?

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:30.677
Freeze!

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.971
Come on, Melina.

01:16:34.306 --> 01:16:35.724
Kuato's waiting.

01:16:35.807 --> 01:16:38.059
I didn't find Grandpa, but--

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:40.854
Oh, shit.

01:16:40.895 --> 01:16:44.065
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:48.361
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

01:16:58.955 --> 01:17:00.915
You're a mutant, huh?

01:17:00.957 --> 01:17:03.293
All right, let's go.

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:21.227
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

01:17:21.311 --> 01:17:23.229
It won't do any good.

01:17:23.313 --> 01:17:26.650
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

01:17:26.733 --> 01:17:29.694
We can't.
We're running out of air.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.780
We need help.

01:17:31.863 --> 01:17:34.532
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.369
I hope he was worth it.

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:39.079
So do I.

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.375
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:46.711
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:49.047
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:51.091
He wants you.

01:17:51.132 --> 01:17:54.970
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

01:17:55.053 --> 01:17:56.721
Then we don't have much choice.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.348
We can't turn him in.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:02.018
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

01:18:16.199 --> 01:18:18.243
Sit down.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:21.121
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

01:18:21.204 --> 01:18:23.748
You heard the rumors
about the Pyramid Mine?

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:25.667
Yeah.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:29.129
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:31.464
What? Aliens?

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.844
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:38.471
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:41.182
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole...

01:18:41.266 --> 01:18:43.184
you call a brain.

01:18:45.812 --> 01:18:47.814
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:51.318
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:55.196
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.071
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:38.907
Same as you: to remember.

01:19:38.949 --> 01:19:41.701
But why?

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:45.038
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:50.669
A man is defined by his actions...

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.880
not his memory.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.383
Please...

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.510
take my hands.

01:20:04.057 --> 01:20:06.476
Now open your mind to me.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:08.895
Please.

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:14.234
Open your mind.

01:20:16.486 --> 01:20:19.030
Open your mind.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:24.577
Open your mind.

01:20:26.329 --> 01:20:30.041
Open your mind.

01:20:31.835 --> 01:20:36.214
Open your mind.

01:21:06.786 --> 01:21:09.164
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

01:21:09.247 --> 01:21:11.875
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:13.960
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

01:21:14.044 --> 01:21:16.755
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

01:21:16.796 --> 01:21:20.008
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

01:21:20.091 --> 01:21:22.385
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

01:21:22.469 --> 01:21:25.639
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

01:21:25.722 --> 01:21:28.391
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

01:21:28.475 --> 01:21:30.644
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

01:21:30.727 --> 01:21:33.063
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

01:21:33.146 --> 01:21:36.441
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.276
Let's make sure Kuato--

01:22:08.765 --> 01:22:12.727
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:16.648
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

01:22:17.857 --> 01:22:20.110
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Come on!

01:22:24.698 --> 01:22:26.074
They found us!

01:22:26.157 --> 01:22:27.659
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.828
Get moving! Get out!

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:31.830
Get out!

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:43.842
Everybody out! Get out!

01:22:49.514 --> 01:22:51.975
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:55.228
Benny, come on!

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.901
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

01:23:21.046 --> 01:23:24.674
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

01:23:27.594 --> 01:23:29.346
Benny, hurry.

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.772
Congratulations, Quaid.

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.107
You led us right to him.

01:23:41.191 --> 01:23:43.944
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

01:23:44.903 --> 01:23:46.821
I got four kids to feed.

01:23:46.905 --> 01:23:49.074
So what happened to number five?

01:23:51.534 --> 01:23:54.162
Shit, man. You got me.

01:23:54.245 --> 01:23:55.956
I ain't even married.

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:58.166
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

01:24:04.047 --> 01:24:05.507
Quaid.

01:24:07.592 --> 01:24:09.636
Quaid.

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:15.642
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

01:24:17.394 --> 01:24:20.272
Start the reactor.

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.232
Free Mars.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.948
Mr. Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

01:24:37.789 --> 01:24:40.166
So this is the great man.

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:47.173
No wonder he kept out of sight.

01:24:49.426 --> 01:24:51.386
Well, my boy...

01:24:53.597 --> 01:24:54.681
you're a hero.

01:24:54.764 --> 01:24:55.849
Fuck you.

01:24:55.932 --> 01:24:59.686
Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:04.065
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:05.567
He's lying.

01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:08.612
You two-faced bastard.

01:25:10.488 --> 01:25:14.159
You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

01:25:15.785 --> 01:25:20.206
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.209
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

01:25:23.293 --> 01:25:27.380
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

01:25:27.464 --> 01:25:30.634
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.389
That's what we wanted
you to think.

01:25:36.473 --> 01:25:40.602
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

01:25:40.685 --> 01:25:43.688
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:45.273
Get your story straight.

01:25:45.357 --> 01:25:48.860
This idiot has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.

01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:51.237
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:55.241
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:58.244
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:00.246
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:03.875
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money...

01:26:03.917 --> 01:26:07.879
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:10.465
Sorry. Too perfect.

01:26:10.548 --> 01:26:12.217
Perfect, my ass!

01:26:12.259 --> 01:26:14.886
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:19.057
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.977
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:24.604
Well, Cohaagen...

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:28.316
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:32.779
Well, don't take my word for it.

01:26:33.947 --> 01:26:37.075
-Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
-Who is it this time?

01:26:37.117 --> 01:26:39.119
My mother?

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.622
Howdy, Quaid.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.167
If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead...

01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:48.628
and you have led us to him.

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.672
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

01:26:50.755 --> 01:26:52.924
Sorry for the shit
I've put you through, but hey...

01:26:53.008 --> 01:26:55.510
what are friends for?

01:26:55.594 --> 01:26:58.888
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

01:26:58.972 --> 01:27:01.975
but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

01:27:02.017 --> 01:27:06.187
You see, it's my body you've got there
and I want it back.

01:27:06.271 --> 01:27:10.525
Sorry to be an lndian giver,
but I was here first.

01:27:10.609 --> 01:27:13.194
So adios, amigo.

01:27:13.278 --> 01:27:16.489
And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.

01:27:16.573 --> 01:27:19.200
Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.

01:27:22.829 --> 01:27:24.748
You never know.

01:27:29.502 --> 01:27:31.588
You bastards!

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.232
Let go of me!

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:09.417
- Ready?
- Auto.

01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:12.420
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.675
Relax, Quaid.

01:28:16.716 --> 01:28:20.095
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

01:28:20.178 --> 01:28:23.431
That's not true.
He's one of my best friends.

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:26.434
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:30.522
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:33.733
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.986
I'll bust his balls.

01:28:38.113 --> 01:28:40.407
Uh-uh, princess.

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.909
We're having you fixed.

01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:46.329
You're going to be respectful,
compliant...

01:28:46.413 --> 01:28:49.916
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:55.755
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

01:28:58.508 --> 01:29:00.176
Yes? What is it?

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:03.096
The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:05.348
What do you want me
to do about it?

01:29:05.432 --> 01:29:09.477
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

01:29:09.561 --> 01:29:10.645
Fuck 'em.

01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:13.273
It'll be a good lesson
to the others.

01:29:13.356 --> 01:29:16.067
You got what you want.
Give these people air.

01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:19.904
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

01:29:19.946 --> 01:29:21.239
Fire it up, Doc.

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:23.408
Excuse me, Doctor.

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:25.660
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:27.829
Oh, really?

01:29:38.298 --> 01:29:39.966
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:42.761
Why don't you and Melina drop by.
Remind him, Doc.

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:45.180
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

01:29:59.736 --> 01:30:02.238
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:17.837
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

01:30:22.008 --> 01:30:23.468
Hey, don't!

01:30:30.433 --> 01:30:32.143
Melina, hold on!

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:58.378
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.840
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

01:31:04.676 --> 01:31:06.094
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.957
You have to make a decision, sir.

01:31:46.426 --> 01:31:47.677
Kill him.

01:31:48.887 --> 01:31:50.889
It's about goddamn time.

01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:45.944
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:49.781
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:53.827
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:57.080
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

01:32:57.163 --> 01:32:58.748
Where's this reactor come from?

01:32:58.832 --> 01:33:00.875
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

01:33:00.959 --> 01:33:04.296
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.133
What the hell--

01:33:32.616 --> 01:33:33.575
Quaid!

01:33:33.617 --> 01:33:36.745
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

01:33:36.828 --> 01:33:39.164
Benny! Benny's the name!

01:33:53.303 --> 01:33:54.804
Oh, that's good!

01:34:00.602 --> 01:34:02.896
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:04.898
I'm gonna grind you up!

01:34:11.947 --> 01:34:13.949
I'm coming!

01:34:14.032 --> 01:34:15.700
I'm coming for you, baby!

01:34:31.174 --> 01:34:33.426
What the fuck is this?

01:34:39.975 --> 01:34:42.102
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:47.232
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:50.110
Benny, here!

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.906
Where the fuck are you?

01:35:00.578 --> 01:35:02.330
Screw you!

01:35:08.378 --> 01:35:10.463
Quaid, get over here!

01:35:10.547 --> 01:35:12.299
What is it?

01:35:13.258 --> 01:35:14.342
There's an opening.

01:35:15.468 --> 01:35:17.137
I knew it.

01:35:45.874 --> 01:35:49.169
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

01:35:49.252 --> 01:35:52.672
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

01:35:52.714 --> 01:35:54.007
Of course not.

01:35:54.049 --> 01:35:57.010
If Mars had an atmosphere,
he'd lose control.

01:35:58.178 --> 01:35:59.596
See down there?

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:03.183
It's a glacier.

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:06.353
The whole core of Mars is ice.

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:08.813
The reactor melts it...

01:36:08.897 --> 01:36:10.732
and it releases the oxygen.

01:36:10.815 --> 01:36:12.192
Come on.

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:15.236
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.239
Enough for the whole planet.

01:36:18.323 --> 01:36:20.575
If we turn it on in time.

01:36:27.207 --> 01:36:29.167
Come on. Come on!

01:36:46.351 --> 01:36:47.435
Hold on.

01:37:18.675 --> 01:37:19.634
Now!

01:37:50.165 --> 01:37:51.374
Son of a bitch.

01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.758
Go!

01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:05.680
He's got a hologram!

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:30.205
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

01:39:50.076 --> 01:39:52.203
You're coming with me!

01:40:05.675 --> 01:40:07.928
See you at the party, Richter.

01:40:46.174 --> 01:40:47.425
Don't touch that!

01:40:47.467 --> 01:40:49.469
Get away! Get back!

01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:50.971
What are you afraid of?

01:40:51.012 --> 01:40:53.431
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

01:40:53.515 --> 01:40:56.643
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

01:40:56.726 --> 01:40:59.020
Mars will go into
global meltdown.

01:40:59.104 --> 01:41:01.773
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

01:41:01.856 --> 01:41:03.942
And you expect me
to believe you?

01:41:04.025 --> 01:41:08.571
Who gives a shit what you believe?
ln 30 seconds you'll be dead.

01:41:08.655 --> 01:41:12.033
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.539
I didn't want it to end this way.

01:41:17.622 --> 01:41:19.666
I wanted Hauser back.
But no.

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:23.128
You had to be Quaid!

01:41:23.169 --> 01:41:25.630
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

01:41:25.714 --> 01:41:28.800
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

01:41:28.883 --> 01:41:32.887
Well, all dreams come to an end.

01:42:47.671 --> 01:42:50.048
Melina, hold on!

01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:51.716
Don't do it!

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.760
We'll all die!

01:42:54.636 --> 01:42:57.097
Everybody will die!

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.703
Quaid!

01:49:16.810 --> 01:49:19.229
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.148
What's wrong?

01:49:22.232 --> 01:49:26.027
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:30.657
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
