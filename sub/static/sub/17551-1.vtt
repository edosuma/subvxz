[hip hop music]

01:15.560 --> 01:17.289
[man] Listen up, pledges!

01:17.360 --> 01:21.046
This frat's Halloween parties
have always been epic.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.360
[men] Epic!

01:22.440 --> 01:24.681
And this year will be no exception.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.206
My reputation is on the line.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.602
So if I fail, you all fail.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.206
And we all know that Jonathan
doesn't fail, right?

01:33.320 --> 01:34.401
- [all] Right!
- Got it?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.606
[man] Got it.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.207
You see? Now this is why I know
that tonight's gonna be epic, fellas.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.567
- [snoring]
- Would somebody wake him up?

01:41.640 --> 01:44.041
- [man 1] Horse, hey.
- [man 2] Wake up!

01:44.120 --> 01:46.361
The Horse is always up, man.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.284
Bean Boy.
Tell your president what today is.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.044
It's Halloween time, sir!

01:51.120 --> 01:55.921
And why is Halloween so important
to this frat's reputation, Bean?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.321
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we have the longest tradition

01:58.400 --> 02:00.323
of throwing the best
Halloween parties ever, sir.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.006
- [people cheer]
- And what will be your contribution be

02:03.080 --> 02:06.971
to make sure that tonight
is the best party ever?

02:07.040 --> 02:10.282
I've been recruiting
some of the best talent on campus.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.050
This is pledgee Cummings.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.442
Studies film makeup, sir.
Best in my class.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.045
How's it going, man... Sir?

02:17.120 --> 02:19.851
And I found this guy.
Pledgee Mond...

02:20.400 --> 02:23.290
Mondon!
Mondon! Oh.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.089
This is pledge Mondon, everyone.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.367
- Whoa.
- Weird name, cool guy.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.410
This guy can hack into anything.
I mean, anything.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.856
- [man] Nice.
- K? Remember last year?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.450
When he hacked into the Beta Sorority?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.204
- Yes! Yes!
- Into the webcams?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.376
- [people cheering]
- I remember that.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.526
- I remember that.
- Yeah!

02:37.600 --> 02:41.525
Very illegal, kind of creepy.
But very fun, nonetheless.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.404
Dude, can we do that again?
I was so happy.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.324
Breathe. Take a breath.
That's why I got him.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.762
And, sir, this is pledgee
Wells and Dimps,

02:49.840 --> 02:51.251
and they are very special.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.084
Pledgees, show them.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.730
- [man] All right!
- [crowd cheering]

02:55.480 --> 02:57.562
[hip hop music]

02:59.120 --> 03:00.246
[all exclaim]

03:06.880 --> 03:08.564
[all exclaim]

03:10.760 --> 03:12.444
[Horse]
Ladies alert! Ladies alert!

03:12.520 --> 03:14.680
- Oh, that's them. That's them.
- [Horse] Ladies alert!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.409
These are college guys.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.721
[boys howling]

03:20.800 --> 03:22.211
- Ladies!
- [Leah] What up, boys?

03:22.280 --> 03:23.770
- Damn.
- Hi.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.127
Hey. I'm Renaldo,
but my friends call me Horse

03:26.200 --> 03:28.806
[boys chuckling]

03:28.880 --> 03:31.247
- I'm Rain, and this is my friend.
- Leah.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.810
I'm Tiffany.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.723
- My name's Aday.
- I'm Jonathan,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.768
the <i>El</i> Presidente
of this here fraterni-tay.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.410
- [boys cheer]
- [laughs]

03:39.440 --> 03:40.726
Well, what's up with you ladies?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.531
You are now staring
at Upsilon Theta's finest.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.925
[all hiss]

03:46.680 --> 03:48.762
- [chuckles]
- You girls go to school here?

03:48.840 --> 03:50.365
- No. No.
- No.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.171
- No, we go to St. Mary's.
- Oh, that's what's up.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.527
St. Mary's, that's
an all-girl college, right?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.809
So y'all probably never seen
a dude before in real life.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.407
This right here,
this is what a dude looks like.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.165
[Jonathan] All right, look.
We're having a Halloween party tonight,

04:05.240 --> 04:07.322
- and it's gonna be...
- [all] Epic!

04:07.400 --> 04:08.970
- Oh, well...
- Epic.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.687
Um...

04:12.600 --> 04:13.647
Concussion.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.495
[Jonathan] So why don't
you ladies come on by

04:16.519 --> 04:18.170
and be Jonathan's special guest?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.480
What time?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.920
[Jonathan] The party starts at 10:00,
so come when you like.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.088
- Oh, I don't know about...
- We'll see you tonight.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.280
[Jonathan] Give me your phone.
I'll put my number in.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.966
Tiffany, there's your dad.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.445
Chill out. Chill.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.363
- Rain, Leah, Aday...
- Hi.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.488
- Hi, Mr. Simmons.
- So hot.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.642
Daddy issues.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.489
[Brian]
Tiffany, what's going on?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.085
Hey, Old Man River,

04:46.160 --> 04:48.640
ain't you got some pigeons
to feed or something? Take a hike.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.131
[Brian]
I'm sorry. Old Man River?

04:50.200 --> 04:51.416
Who you talking to, son?
Who you talking to?

04:51.440 --> 04:52.726
Do you see your grandpa here?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.529
Have you looked in the mirror, son?

04:54.600 --> 04:56.682
You're in college
and you look like you're 67, okay?

04:56.760 --> 04:58.489
- Bring it. You bring it.
- Dino...

04:58.560 --> 05:00.881
- I want you to bring it so badly.
- Dino.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.496
I will whoop your ass.
You understand that?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.726
I will whoop your <i>ass.</i>

05:03.800 --> 05:07.441
Dad, he's pretty big.
He is the star lineman on the team.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.726
Pfft! Look at me.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.564
- [stuttering] I play...
- Tennis.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.530
In high school, 30 years ago.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.204
Chill out, pops. It's cool.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.408
[Brian] Who are you? Thor?
Did Thor just...

05:17.480 --> 05:19.562
What the hell are you telling me,
"Chill out, pops"?

05:19.640 --> 05:22.564
You don't tell me to chill out, okay?
That's my daughter, son.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.936
- Son, Fabio, whatever.
- [boys chuckle]

05:23.960 --> 05:25.564
Nobody's talking to you.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.166
Go somewhere, grow your hair
and stay out of this, okay?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.560
Sir, I'll take
care of them, okay?

05:29.640 --> 05:30.846
Back to the frat house.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.571
You see? [scoffs]

05:33.640 --> 05:36.530
It won't happen again, sir.
I'm so sorry. Bye, girls.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.376
[Brian] Tiffany,
how many times have I told you

05:38.400 --> 05:39.845
not to walk past this frat house?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.456
Well, we were just
walking by, Mr. Simmons,

05:41.480 --> 05:42.845
and they stopped us.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.256
- It's not our fault.
- We didn't do anything.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.536
You're coming home.
Get in the car.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.846
No. No, no, no, no, guys.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.763
There's no room in there
for all of us.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.696
The house is right there.
We're just gonna walk.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.370
Tiffany, get in the car.

05:52.440 --> 05:55.284
It's right there. We can walk.
Come on. Come on.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.601
Come on.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.011
- Bye, Mr. Simmons.
- Bye!

05:58.080 --> 05:59.605
He seems angry.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.648
She never listens to you.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.603
So you know my mom used to
teach theater in school, right?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.736
So I have all these
really cool costumes in the attic.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.684
We're gonna come up with something
so hot for the party tonight.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.649
- Hot?
- Do you know your dad?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.245
He's not gonna let you go.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.402
Just let me deal with that, okay?

06:17.520 --> 06:19.936
Just meet me here at 10:00
and we can figure it out from there.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.486
- Okay.
- I don't know.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.324
She's coming. You're coming.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.606
I am so excited.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.011
I know, this is gonna be so wild.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.445
[shrieks]

06:29.720 --> 06:31.643
- Bye, girls!
- Bye!

06:31.720 --> 06:33.563
Oh, Lord.
I don't know about this.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.244
You're coming. Come on.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.322
We gotta figure out
what we're gonna wear.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.402
- Ohh!
- Gonna be so fun!

06:42.320 --> 06:45.051
[whispering] There's gonna be
boys there. I don't like that.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.930
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not so fast. Not so fast.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.321
Listen to me.
How many times do I have to tell you?

06:50.400 --> 06:52.562
Do not walk past that frat house.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.016
You're out there,
you're talking to those guys.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.280
They are college kids.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.656
You're 17 years old, you're not
supposed to be talking to them.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.241
Do you understand me?
And what do you have on? What is this?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.448
Tiffany, I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.966
Do not take your uniform off

07:06.040 --> 07:09.328
until you get into this house.
Are we clear?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.368
Leah and Rain's mom lets them do it.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.408
I am not Leah or Rain's parent.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.005
I am your parent.
Do you understand?

07:15.120 --> 07:17.361
And what I tell you,
you have to learn to listen to.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.566
I don't want you to do it.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.483
Okay, then buy me a car

07:20.560 --> 07:22.176
so I won't have to
walk past the frat house.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.896
Do you hear yourself?
I'm not buying you a car.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.366
That makes no sense to me.
I'm not buying you a car.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.284
- You have to finish school...
- Finish school. I... Yeah...

07:29.360 --> 07:31.016
- Do not mock me.
- [mockingly] Do not mock me.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.008
- Tiffany! Stop!
- [mockingly] Tiffany! Stop!

07:33.080 --> 07:34.525
Stop... You...
[continues mocking]

07:34.640 --> 07:36.130
Then stop talking.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.370
I'm an adult, I can say
what I wanna say in this house.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.766
Do you understand?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.256
[stuttering]
I can say what I wanna say

07:43.280 --> 07:44.776
and what I'm telling you
right now is this.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.564
You have to watch out
for those college kids.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.880
Those boys want one thing...

07:47.960 --> 07:50.361
Um, one thing
and what's that thing?

07:50.440 --> 07:52.096
The thing is for somebody
to pay their student loans.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.727
Now go upstairs and finish your...
Do something and get packed.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.450
Okay, Dad, sure.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.480
But I know you're not talking
about student loans.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.726
Go get packed.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.086
Packed?
Where is he going?

08:02.160 --> 08:03.924
He and you, you're both
going to your mom's.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.736
I have work to do, so you
and your brother are going.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.886
She's coming to pick you up.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.486
I'm 17, I do not
have to go to my mom's.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.006
I am not leaving you
in this house on Halloween.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.289
I don't care if you're 17,
you're not staying here alone.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.089
Okay, well then
Aday can stay with me.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.366
How about that?

08:18.440 --> 08:20.090
- I will?
- Yes, you will.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.050
Oh, actually, my parents wouldn't mind
me staying here for Halloween.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.124
- We don't celebrate it anyways.
- My dad...

08:26.200 --> 08:27.896
Well, I think he'd actually
be okay with it, actually,

08:27.920 --> 08:31.003
because every Halloween,
we just go to church.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.049
- To church?
- Yes, church on Halloween, sir.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.176
Actually, a lot of the parents
don't like their children

08:36.200 --> 08:39.966
celebrating the Devil's holiday with
the ghosts and the goblins and whatnot.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.535
So they bring their children to church.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.450
They get dressed up
in holy costumes and Bible characters.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.176
You know, last year
I was actually the Ghost.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.441
Wait, you just said
they don't celebrate ghosts.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.045
Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.771
Yeah, and then we also have
a carnival, as well.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.446
We give candy out to the children
so they don't feel left out.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.443
And the adults,
they have a prayer service.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.736
And it's all good, it's all jolly
and we just love getting together...

08:59.760 --> 09:00.921
Okay. Okay, all right.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.445
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.176
- Please go ahead and call him.
- No, no, no.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.440
Thank you very much.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.976
But no, I'm not leaving you
in this house.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.696
No, okay, there's no way
I'm going to Mom's.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.927
Absolutely no, no, no, no, no.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.527
No way. We're staying.
So call her dad.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.806
[sighs]

09:15.880 --> 09:18.406
- Come on, Aday.
- Ooh.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.527
[Aday]
I do not know about this party tonight.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.690
- I don't wanna go.
- No, it'll be fun. Okay, listen.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.610
We have to go.
Girl, we cannot stay in this house.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.489
Leah and Rain are going.
It'll be fun.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.449
But, I... It's just...

09:38.520 --> 09:42.161
No! No, but nothing, okay? Come on. Sit.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.447
Listen, they like us.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.722
And they're the most
popular girls in school.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.882
- [whispering] Popular...
- Okay? We can't not go

09:48.960 --> 09:51.645
and be right where we were
when we first got to that school.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.722
They're popular because
they wear those baby shirts

09:53.800 --> 09:55.609
that shows what the Good Lord gave 'em.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.648
Plus, why do they have to set the trend?

09:57.720 --> 10:01.486
Okay, number one,
those baby shirts are called crop tops.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.040
And did you see how those guys
were drooling over them?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.441
Did you see how they were
drooling over you?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.921
Because I took notes from them.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.570
Okay. Come on.
We gotta go to the attic,

10:10.640 --> 10:12.529
create something
really hot for tonight.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.250
- Let's get.
- [whispering] Hot...

10:14.320 --> 10:15.401
- [phone beeps]
- Wait.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.684
- He's texting me.
- Who's texting you?

10:19.760 --> 10:21.649
Jonathan, the cute frat boy.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.768
I thought that boy
was staring at Rain.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.606
He was, for now. Come on.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.005
- For now?
- Yeah.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.565
<i>[Debra]
She needs to stay with me.</i>

10:34.640 --> 10:37.136
Debra, I already told her that, okay?
She doesn't wanna stay with you.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.606
<i>You're her dad,
you need to put your foot down.</i>

10:39.680 --> 10:40.886
<i>Are you listening?</i>

10:40.960 --> 10:42.121
Yes, I'm listening to you.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.645
- <i>Well?</i>
- Yeah, I know I'm her dad.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.960
You're her mom, okay?

10:45.080 --> 10:46.684
- I can't...
- <i>Get</i> her ready!

10:46.760 --> 10:48.616
She doesn't wanna come,
she doesn't have to come.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.136
- <i>She doesn't</i> wanna go...
<i>- But she needs to.</i>

10:50.160 --> 10:52.731
All right, listen. Just come...
Come and pick BJ up.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.690
- I don't wanna argue about this.
- Now I'm on my way.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.126
[cell phone beeps]

10:58.200 --> 10:59.884
Tiffany, somebody...

11:03.960 --> 11:05.371
The hell?

11:11.920 --> 11:12.967
[sighs]

11:13.640 --> 11:14.880
This girl.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.721
[distant howling]

11:19.800 --> 11:22.644
[Barn]
Open your little bag up wide.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.087
So I can drop it
all the way down to the bottom.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.576
[Madea] I don't even know why
you sitting out here with these...

11:27.600 --> 11:29.056
What you doing with these canes, Bam?

11:29.080 --> 11:30.127
[kids] Trick or treat!

11:30.200 --> 11:31.645
[Bam] Mabel...

11:31.720 --> 11:34.121
You know I had hip surgery.
I need these canes.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.696
You don't need them canes,
stop that lying.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.056
I seen you running
up and down the street.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.570
Mabel, I need these canes,

11:38.640 --> 11:40.563
and let me tell you,
they were high as hell, too.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.962
Too much for a woman on a fixed income
and I ain't got no extra money

11:44.040 --> 11:46.281
to be wasting on no canes like these.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.648
So I gotta use these so that I don't
have to go back to the hospital.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.816
I know them
two little girls right there.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.365
If you... Hold on
just a second, honey.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.096
If you're so worried
about money on a fixed income,

11:54.120 --> 11:56.616
why the hell are you out here
giving these little heathens candy?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.610
- Mabel, I like this.
- No, Bam, uh-uh. No.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.336
This is why I'm not
in my damn house right now.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.567
- What?
- I don't like no doggone Halloween.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.776
I'm not gonna be giving them children
no candy for free. Hell!

12:05.800 --> 12:08.406
When I was growing up, do you know
what I had to do for candy?

12:08.480 --> 12:09.656
Do you know
what I had to do for candy?

12:09.680 --> 12:10.886
What, Mabel?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.684
I had to give up candy to get candy.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.330
That's why.
But I'm not gonna do that,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.289
spend my hard-earned money
on no candy gifting.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.567
It's going in my retirement,
my Ho-O-1-K.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.563
I'm not gonna do it,
give no child no candy.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.847
Mabel, what is Ho-O-1-K?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.410
It's for hoes.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.245
It's for all of those women
who never ever

12:27.320 --> 12:30.210
were able to pay taxes on their money
because they got it illegally.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.762
So you put the money aside.
It's not a 401 K, it's a Ho-O-1-K.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.056
- That's why I got a Ho-O-1-K.
- Oh!

12:35.080 --> 12:37.401
Yeah, from back in the day
when I was stripping.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.200
- I wonder why...
- When I was on that pole.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.130
I'm not gonna spend
my Ho-O-1-K on nobody.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.336
No, I'm not gonna do that,
giving no children no candy.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.010
I don't know why you doing it.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.256
Now, see, look at this.
Look at this.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.681
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

12:49.760 --> 12:51.683
Look at his little outfit!

12:51.760 --> 12:54.206
Here you go!
Here you go, baby, right here.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.327
What's he supposed to be?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.686
He's a G.I.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.807
Thank you.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.967
You're welcome.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.326
He salute.
[laughs]

13:00.400 --> 13:01.686
Yeah.
[laughs]

13:01.800 --> 13:03.211

13:03.280 --> 13:05.282

- Yeah.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.726
Saw me do what?

13:08.800 --> 13:10.006
[chuckles] Bam!

13:10.080 --> 13:12.765
Barn, I saw you drop
a little piece of candy up in there

13:12.840 --> 13:14.336
and take four or five pieces
out of that baby bag.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.089
- What the hell?
- Shh!

13:16.160 --> 13:17.730
Is that what you out here doing?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.404
Mabel, shh!

13:19.480 --> 13:21.296
- Why you doing that?
- Mabel, sometimes you get

13:21.320 --> 13:24.722
the munchies after you smoke, honey,
and this candy be coming in handy.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.043
And lookit, I been doing this for years.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.400
- Barn.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.811
You high now, ain't you?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.403
Yeah.
[laughs]

13:33.480 --> 13:37.405
Uh-uh. Mabel, look, don't judge me.
I got a prescription.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.723
I'm so glad, I was so glad
when this thing finally came!

13:40.840 --> 13:44.447
Hey! I can't wait
to show it to the police.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.885
Put that away, Bam.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.296
Sitting here high,
taking candy from babies.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.656
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.856
Well, you gotta teach them something.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.536
You gotta teach 'em something
and you gotta teach them at some time.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.050
I don't like this Halloween stuff.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.565
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

13:55.640 --> 13:57.416
I'm the trick, she the treat.
Now go the hell on.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.204
Why they got that boy
dressed like a cow?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.009
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.096
Got that child dressed
like chocolate milk in a box.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.485
- Mabel!
- What?

14:04.560 --> 14:06.767
Don't do that.
You gonna scar this baby.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.296
[Madea]
But you better watch him, Bam.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.616
- Mmm-mmm.
- Uh-uh, you better watch him,

14:09.640 --> 14:11.210

14:11.280 --> 14:12.616
That's a O.G. right there.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.369
[rapping]

14:14.440 --> 14:15.496

14:15.520 --> 14:16.760

14:16.840 --> 14:18.410

14:18.480 --> 14:20.164
He counting every one
of them damn candies.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.651
He ain't counting calories,

14:21.720 --> 14:23.882
but he counting them damn candies.
[chuckles]

14:23.960 --> 14:25.291
Shut your mouth, will you?

I'm telling you, you better be careful,

- You about to get stabbed.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.896
- Look at this. Here you go!
- That boy ain't playing.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.809
Put it down here
so I can put it in there.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.087
Here you go, baby! There you go.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.450
Oh, Lord...

14:49.520 --> 14:52.000
There you go. All right, go on.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.849
[both chuckling]

14:53.920 --> 14:54.967
Wait a minute.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.286
What'd I tell you?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.488
I had more candy in here than this.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.166
Biggie about to shoot you, Tupac.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.480
I don't... I don't know what...

15:02.560 --> 15:04.722
I have no idea
what you talking about.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.811
You took candy
from my pumpkin, grandma.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.009
No, I didn't do that, baby.
Why would I do that? Mabel?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.081
[chuckling]

15:13.160 --> 15:14.491
You tricked me.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.250
You put candy in
but took a handful out.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.401
What... Did you do that?

15:17.520 --> 15:19.841
Did you see me do that?
Listen, let me tell you something.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.446
You need to teach your son
these principles at home, honey.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.251
That's why they call it
"trick or treat."

15:25.360 --> 15:26.691
[Madea laughing]

15:26.760 --> 15:28.967
That is not nice.
What's wrong with you?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.896
Hold on now, you ain't finna be
gettin' on my damn friend.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.365
Let me tell you something, honey.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.807
You gone and had your child
disrespecting her, okay?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.803
If she say she didn't do it,
she didn't do it.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.370
You understand?
We let us... Hold on.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.176
You talk about look at her?
Look at your child.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.123

He is just perfect.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.044
What's wrong?
You asking what's wrong with her?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.521
What's wrong with your damn child?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.886
- [Barn] Mabel. Mabel.
- What?

15:48.960 --> 15:50.086
That baby can hear you.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.810
I don't give a damn if he can hear me.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.216
Come out here, you got him
trick or treating for candy.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.403
You need to have him trick or treating
for a damn treadmill or an elliptical.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.766
- Momma!
- It's okay!

15:57.840 --> 15:59.410
- It's okay! It's okay!
- Come on, bull!

15:59.520 --> 16:01.296

16:05.960 --> 16:07.564
- Mabel.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.776
- They need to learn some time.
- [distant jingle]

16:08.800 --> 16:09.801
- Mabel.
- What?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.530
What the hell is that?
What is that?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.001
Some damn person acting the fool
dressed like a clown.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.650
I don't like this.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.896
They better not come over here with
their foolishness. That's what I know.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.729
Mabel, I'm scared. I don't like this.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.136
- What the hell you scared of?
- Because I don't like this.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.925
Who you know ride up in a box?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.970
And he wind it up, you let something

16:28.480 --> 16:29.576
Don't come over here
with that foolishness.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.840
Don't come over here!

16:30.920 --> 16:32.416
That's gonna make him
come over here, Bam.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.249
- Here he come.
- Hello?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.926
- Hey, Madea. How you doing?
- Hey, Brian. How you doing?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.331
<i>I'm good. I'm good.</i>

16:38.400 --> 16:39.896
Listen, I gotta go
out of town until Sunday

16:39.920 --> 16:42.216
and I was wondering if you can come by
and just keep an eye on Tiffany?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.607
No, son. No, I can't come over there.
It's Halloween night,

16:44.680 --> 16:46.216

nowhere on Halloween.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.456
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>My feet hurting...</i>

16:47.480 --> 16:48.925
I ain't got no gas in my car.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.096
- Okay, great, I get it.
- <i>I got gout in...</i>

16:50.120 --> 16:51.451
<i>[Bam] Mabel.</i>

16:51.520 --> 16:53.016
Hush, Barn. Calm down.
Don't worry about that fool

16:53.040 --> 16:54.296
coming over here.
Let him come over here.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.136
- I don't like no clowns.
- It's gonna be all right.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.969
Don't come over here.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.976
You better not come over here
with this foolishness like...

17:00.000 --> 17:01.331
<i>dressed up like a damn clown.</i>

17:01.400 --> 17:05.121
My breast is hurting, my back
is hurting. You know, we hit this age

17:05.200 --> 17:07.056
<i>everything hurts something.
No, son. No, I can't.</i>

17:07.079 --> 17:08.080
<i>I'll</i> pay You-

17:08.160 --> 17:10.083
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in an hour.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.730
That's what I thought.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.480
Look. Look, there. There. There.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.800
Don't come over here
with that damn foolishness.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.483
I'm telling you right now.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.125
- [Barn] Dea.
- Don't be scared, honey.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.009
[Madea]
Look here, you scaring my friend.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.208
- Mmm-mmm. Look. Mmm-mmm.
- Bam, calm down.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.444
My friend is scared. Y'all need to
go the hell on with all that foo...

17:29.520 --> 17:30.646
Oh, you think I'm playing.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.016
See, now that's what I'm talking about.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.485
Let something jump up out of there.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.006
Let something jump up
out of this damn box.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.525
Let something come up out of there.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.601
Boo!

17:40.240 --> 17:42.163
- [Hattie] Damn, y'all!
- Yeah, you get.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.083
You got knocked the... out.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.481
[Joe] Damn, Dea.
You ain't got to hit her like that.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.562
- Joe?
- [Hattie] Help me up off this ground.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.768
[Madea] Hattie?
What the hell wrong with y'all?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.531
Damn, Ma! You ain't had
to punch me like that.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.251
- You lucky I didn't shoot your ass!
- You all right, Hattie?

17:56.320 --> 18:00.006
Hell, no, I ain't all right.
She just punched me like a damn dude.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.296
The hell wrong with you, Hattie?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.776
You know black people
scared of every damn thing.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.736
- You all right, baby. Walk it off.
- Walk it off?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.046
- Walk it off.
- Walk it off?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.929
- Walk it off.
- I ain't walking nothing off.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.816
Look at Barn out here
shaking like a salt shaker.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.136
Barn always shaking.
Hell, every time she walk, she shaking.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.083
It's called aftershock.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.730
You wrong for that, Ma.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.201
We weren't doing nothing
but trying to scare y'all.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.648
Don't do that, Hattie.
You know I'm scared of everything.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.816
[Madea] Right, yeah, you know
every time she gets too scared

18:23.840 --> 18:26.844
she drop a tear and if she laugh
too hard, she'll squirt a little pee.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.416
Mabel, you don't have to
keep telling everybody that.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.044
- Well, it's the truth.
- No, it ain't.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.416
Yes. You know you squirt a little pee

18:31.440 --> 18:33.056
- every time you get scared.
- No, I don't!

18:33.080 --> 18:34.600
It's true. You probably wet right now.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.490
- I'll be... I'll be right back.
- See? What I tell you?

18:39.560 --> 18:42.245
Hurry up in there.
We gotta go on over to Brian's house.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.049
Oh, hell, they got drinks over there.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.416
- [Hattie] Drinks?
- Ain't nobody invite you over there.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.816
You ain't getting in my car
till you take them damn clown suits off.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.605
Come on, Joe. Ain't nobody
got to invite me for a drink.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.040
- Hurry up! Hurry up in there, Barn!
- I'm gonna get me one.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
[knocking on door]

19:03.640 --> 19:05.085
Madea, hey.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.164
Hey, there. How you doing, baby?
Good to see you.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.368
I'll tell you about it when you go in.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.171
- You brought my daddy.
- What up, bitch?

19:13.240 --> 19:15.527
Daddy, don't use
that language in this house.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.886
[laughs]

19:18.120 --> 19:19.121
[sighs]

19:21.200 --> 19:24.170
- Hey, Brian!
- Oh, Ms. Hattie, how you doing?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.766
- Hey! Give me a hug.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.016
I'll pass on that.
I'll pass on that.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.849
- Why?
- You know why!

19:29.920 --> 19:33.686
Every time you hug up on him,
you thrust your pelvis into his.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.604
What? He a grown-ass man,
he can take it.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.526
- I don't want to take it, Ms. Hattie.
- You can take it if you want to, Brian.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.136
I don't want to take it, Ms. Hattie.
Thank you, I don't wanna take it.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.736
Hattie, I know damn well
you are not flirtin'.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.496
Keep it up I'ma knock you
upside your head, hell.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.536
Now, Joe, I done told you
about talkin' at me like that.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.164
You think I'm some baby...

19:50.240 --> 19:51.576
You sit down over there,
shit and hell.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.204
[Hattie shouting indistinctly]

19:53.280 --> 19:57.365
Would y'all stop all that?
Calm down.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.249
Brian, come on, baby, can you please
help me in here to the chairs, baby?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.926
- Help you, sure.
- Yeah. Please, help me in here.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.684
Listen, the steps are
too hard for me now.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.922
- Yes, I know.
- Ever since my hip surgery.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.336
- Didn't know you were coming.
- You didn't know I was coming?

20:10.360 --> 20:13.170
But did you know I had hip surgery?
You know I had hip... Listen.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.720
- Somebody told me.
- That man cut me...

20:15.800 --> 20:17.564
- Did he?
- Yes, he did. Him.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.376
He cut me, Brian,
all the way from down here,

20:19.400 --> 20:20.731
all the way back here...

20:20.800 --> 20:22.296
- mid my apple.
- Hey, you need your cane?

20:22.320 --> 20:24.721
Yeah, I need these canes.
I need 'em. Just set 'em...

20:24.800 --> 20:26.802
Yes, I'm on the canes, now.
I need 'em, yeah.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.531
- But you gave 'em to...
- Yeah, put 'em over there.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.176
Sit 'em up there on the wall,
over there.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.488
Listen, Brian,
but I just thank God...

20:34.560 --> 20:37.131
- Thank God that I'm in my right mind.
- Hmm.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.646
- And that my heart is still beating.
- Hmm.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.131
- Ho!
- Yeah.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.726
Sometimes I can't
hardly pee, though.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.246
Thank you so much for sharing.
I appreciate it, thank you.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.322
Bam, that ain't polite conversation.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.176
You know, just one or two drops,
Mabel, that's it.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.328
Don't nobody wanna hear
about your one or two drops.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.084
I wonder why that is.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.764
It's prostate cancer, that's what it is.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.525
You got that prostate...
You got the prostate cancer.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.409
Joe, shut up!

21:00.480 --> 21:02.256
What the hell you think it is?
What the hell else is it,

21:02.280 --> 21:03.691
if it ain't prostate ca...

21:03.760 --> 21:06.376
That's the only thing keep you from
peein'. She said she get two drops.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.166
One say "prostate," other say "cancer."
Prostate cancer. That's what she got.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.446
- She got it.
- [Madea] Joe.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.522
Don't no woman have no prostate.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.730
Mabel, you know damn well
you got a prostate.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.800
You know what I'm gonna do?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.256
I'm gonna give you a prostate exam
with this foot right here.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.520
Right here. Say something else.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.840
Hell, you ain't, either.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.604
This here? This ass?
"Do not enter."

21:33.680 --> 21:35.045
Sign on it, tattoo.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.776
- Do not enter back there.
- [Hattie] Hell, no!

21:36.800 --> 21:39.246
- Who the hell you think I am?
- Shut up.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.489
Hello? Can we just focus on
why I asked you to come...

21:42.560 --> 21:44.296
Who the hell is he,
who the hell he hollerin' at?

21:44.320 --> 21:45.936
You asked me to come over
to your damn house.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.564
Don't be hollerin' at me up in here.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.645
- Don't get gutted up in here.
- Right. Like a fish.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.456
Okay, sorry. Sorry.
I didn't mean that at all.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.563
Yes, that's better. That's better.
Show some apologection up in here.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.246
- Apologection into the room.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.856
I'm glad you're here
to help me with her,

22:00.880 --> 22:02.376
'cause there's a frat party
around the corner.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.290
And I wanna be sure she doesn't try to
sneak out and go over there, okay?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.443
- She too young for that!
- [softly] I know. I...

22:08.520 --> 22:11.364
I don't know about that, I remember
I used to go to a frat party, man.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.569
We had them girls up in there.
Oh! God damn.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.565
- Hell, no. She can't go over there.
- [Hattie] What?

22:18.640 --> 22:23.567
When I was goin' I was 15, baby.
And I was the entertainment, then.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.976
All right, you were
the entertainment, I get it.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.924
Thank you. Okay, listen.
I'm glad you're here. 'Cause I...

22:28.000 --> 22:29.336
I want you to be quiet,
if you don't mind,

22:29.360 --> 22:32.842
'cause I don't want her to know that
you all are here until after I'm gone.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.524
Hold the hell on.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.016
You finna leave, you ain't
gonna tell her you're going?

22:36.040 --> 22:38.327
- Looks like he's scared of her.
- Right.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.016
Damn, boy.
You lettin' a girl run over you?

22:40.040 --> 22:41.690
Look how you
standin' there sweatin'.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.525
- [stuttering] Listen, I...
- These children today.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.896
No, it ain't the children, baby,
it's the parents.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.970
It's these damn parents.
The parents I don't understand.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.804
That's what it is. Right there.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.136
If these parents were getting in charge
of these children here,

22:54.160 --> 22:55.536
we wouldn't be having all these issues.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.804
Come on, you know. Those teenage years,
when they turn into a teenager.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.296
Boy, I remember them
teenage years, baby,

23:01.320 --> 23:02.970
I remember them teenage years.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.849
You got to drop the damn hammer.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.843
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
- Drop the hammer on them.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.285
Them teenage years, hell.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.850
I'm tellin' ya, I keeps me a hammer.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.969
Now we know what the problem is,
anybody in here got a solution?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.976
Is he slow? He don't understand
nothin' I'm saying.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.322
Hattie, can you explain this to him
in a language that he understands?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.006
Whoop. That. Ass.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.809
[Hattie snorts and laughs]

23:22.920 --> 23:24.490
All in favor say "aye."

23:24.560 --> 23:25.891
- [all] Aye.
- The ayes have it.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.096
- Where she at?
- Where she at?

23:27.120 --> 23:31.045
- I get the switch.
- Sit down. I am not hitting my child.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.691
What? You can't stomach it?

23:33.760 --> 23:36.331
- We'll whoop that ass for you!
- No!

23:36.400 --> 23:38.323
Nobody is hitting my child, okay?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.896
I told them early
you need to whip them kids,

23:39.920 --> 23:41.416
I been tellin' him
since they were little.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.522
"Whoop her! Whoop her!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

23:43.600 --> 23:45.736
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

23:45.760 --> 23:47.842
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!"
What'd he do?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.331
He don't whoop her ass.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.404
Listen, we have never spanked our
children, ever. We didn't do that.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.970
We weren't those kind of parents.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.646
- Well, that's the problem right there!
- [Bam] That's right.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.096
That's right, that's right! Whoop her.
Baby, let me tell you something.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.176
I'm not tellin' you to go up there
and abuse no child.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.376
Even though
I got a hammer in my purse.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.209
I'm just kidding about the hammer.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.281
[softly] No, I'm not.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.936
But listen, what I'm trying to get you
to understand is very, very simple, son.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.361
Hear me clearly. A little love tap
ain't never hurt nobody.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.841
- There it is. Love tap.
- [Madea] A little love tap.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.649
Just tap your child.
A little love tap.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.768
Like I did you,
I gave you lots of love taps.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.285
Lot... What?

24:18.360 --> 24:20.761
Hold on a second,
did you just say "love tap"?

24:20.840 --> 24:22.126
No, no, no, no, no.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.568
That wasn't a love tap,
I was on life support.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.016
Are you...
Are you blaming that on me?

24:27.040 --> 24:28.565
That is not my fault.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.336
What'd I have to do with you
being on life support?

24:30.360 --> 24:33.569
Am I missing something? I was
four years old. Whose fault was it?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.962
I told your ass to stop talking back
to me and what did you do?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.407
I said... [imitates babbling]
I was talking back.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.529
Right. So when I bust your ass
and you ended up

24:42.600 --> 24:48.960
in the damn life support situation,
whose problem did that belong to?

24:50.920 --> 24:53.844
You better hold up,
she gonna explode her prostate.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.922
[Madea]
Right. That's your own damn fault.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.056
The defense rests, Your Honor.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.256
- Mmm-hmm.
- The case is closed.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.726
Thank you. The jury has been excused.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.616
You guys don't understand, okay?

25:03.640 --> 25:07.008
I know in your day you could do that,
you could beat kids, you could slap 'em,

25:07.080 --> 25:08.536
but this is a different day and time.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.976
You can't spank your kids
these days, okay?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.764
You go to jail
for things like that now.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.763
That's what it is?
You're politically correct.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.650
Let me tell you somethin' about
"you can't hit your kids these days."

25:16.720 --> 25:18.609
And hear me clearly
when I say this to you, son.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.571
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

25:22.640 --> 25:25.736
Daddy, I'm gonna tell you one more time,
stop using that language in this house.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.728
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!

25:27.800 --> 25:29.165
[Madea] Joe, shut up!

25:29.240 --> 25:31.811
Stop all that saying all them cuss words
up in here, Joe, hell.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.336
Boy, if I didn't whoop your ass
you know where you'd be right now?

25:34.360 --> 25:35.456
Somewhere strung out on drugs.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.496
You don't know the hell...
trying to get 20 dollars for a fix.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.056
You don't know what the hell
you talkin' 'bout.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.800
That's why you turned out
well like you did.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.056
That's why you're a federal prosecutor.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.736
Hell, I beat you so much you were scared
to look at a damn crack pipe.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.216
You ain't know
what a damn crack pipe was.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.004
You know what a crack pipe
is now, don't you?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.776
See, he still don't know
what the hell a crack pipe is.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.485
You know why that is?
'Cause I beat your <i>ass.</i>

25:52.560 --> 25:55.803
[Madea] You sure did, you was
rough on that boy. I felt so bad.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.370
See, your daddy was raw.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.216
He'd beat the hell out you
and leave you out in the street,

25:59.240 --> 26:00.810
just bloody guts all over, everywhere.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.484
I at least would
take you to the hospital

26:02.560 --> 26:03.925
after I knocked the hell out you.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.840
Look, son, just go on up them
stairs, and do what I had to do to you

26:07.960 --> 26:10.884
that day that you got mad at me.
Just go on, do what you gotta do, son.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.291
Bite the bullet.

26:12.360 --> 26:16.729
I am not taking my daughter on the roof
and throwing her off.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.484
Why wouldn't you do that?

26:18.560 --> 26:20.688
- He did that?
- Yes!

26:20.760 --> 26:22.762
- [laughs]
- [Madea] He sure did.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.046
I'ma just tell you somethin',

26:24.120 --> 26:25.256
if you're gonna try
and teach a child a lesson

26:25.280 --> 26:27.806
and push 'em off a roof,
at least check they pockets.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.530
Joe, you should have
checked his pockets.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.650
I forgot about that little pencil. Oh.
Number two, yellow stick.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.563
He had his little pencil
in his pocket...

26:35.640 --> 26:37.016
Little pencil went straight through

26:37.040 --> 26:39.122
- one of his little balls.
- [all exclaim]

26:39.240 --> 26:41.561
Looked like a little
Tootsie Roll on a stick.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.926
That poor thing.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.808
I was traumatized.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.851
Let me ask you somethin'.
Did you die?

26:48.960 --> 26:50.724
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.849
I bet that's just
so interesting to see.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.844
[chuckles]

26:56.920 --> 26:59.241
I just wanna look at it.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.085
I bet you have problems
peein' too, don't you?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.367
You probably just have one drop.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.123
- Plop.
- [all laugh]

27:09.160 --> 27:10.207
Bam, hush that.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.085
Oh... Oh...
Did it grow back?

27:14.160 --> 27:15.685
Grow back?

27:15.760 --> 27:17.762
I'm... I'm not a reptile, it doesn't...

27:17.840 --> 27:20.684
Well, he just told us
he ain't no anaconda.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.001
[all laughing]

27:23.120 --> 27:26.761
Though I almost felt bad when I saw
that little number two yellow pencil.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.808
He almost got lead poisoning.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.456
Daddy, you shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.811
That's all I'm gonna say.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.684
You shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

27:33.760 --> 27:38.368
Again. Did you die, nigga?

27:38.440 --> 27:41.205
How many times I have to tell you?
Stop using that word.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.328
That is a horrible word.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.210
I don't even understand
why you keep using that word.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.328
Stop saying it, it's horrible!

27:48.400 --> 27:50.721
It's awful. All these people
use it in the music...

27:50.800 --> 27:52.136
All these kids
are in these clubs saying it.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.162
Stop saying that word!

27:55.440 --> 27:56.680
<i>Bitch ass.</i>

27:56.760 --> 27:58.808
Daddy, I'm warning you. Stop that...

27:58.880 --> 28:00.848
- Nigga.
- Okay, let's get this clear.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.241
Nobody is laying a hand
on my daughter, okay?

28:03.320 --> 28:07.086
Now, Madea, can you please not tell her
that I asked you to come by?

28:07.160 --> 28:08.969
Okay, can you please
just tell her that...

28:09.080 --> 28:10.081
Um...

28:10.160 --> 28:13.721
You were in the neighborhood,
and... And you stopped by.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.245
Okay? Can you do that?

28:15.320 --> 28:16.376
Yeah, he wants me to lie.
I'm not gonna lie.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.961
- I don't do that. I'm not a liar.
- Why? You scared of her?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.929
No, I'm not scared of her, but I just...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.082
I'm trying this approach
that I read in a book,

28:24.160 --> 28:26.401
that you and your kids should be...

28:26.480 --> 28:28.960
Buddies. Pals.
You should be friends.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.042
Friends? You ain't
supposed to be friends

28:31.120 --> 28:32.770
with your damn child, you the parent.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.171
Y'all not equals.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.527
What the hell you talkin' 'bout,
a friend? A friend?

28:36.600 --> 28:38.816
They have to listen to
what the hell you tell them to do.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.096
If they don't, they gotta
bounce they <i>ass</i> up out the house.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.441
Go pay they own mortgage.
Go pay they own rent.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.363
Go pay something, do you understand?

28:45.440 --> 28:46.601
Being a damn child friend.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.896
What the hell is wrong with you,
talkin' 'bout being your child friend.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.809
- That's stupid as hell!
- I hear you, okay?

28:50.880 --> 28:53.406
- [Tiffany] Dad, you haven't left yet?
- Um...

28:55.120 --> 28:56.804
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.136
[whispering]
Remember what I said to you.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.366
That you stopped by.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.963
- What?
- Ms. Madea, how are you?

29:05.040 --> 29:06.896
Oh, I'm fine, how you doin', baby?
Good to see you.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.160
Good to see you, too.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.480
Who the hell is that?

29:09.600 --> 29:11.921
Mabel! That's the pastor's daughter.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.764
Damn, you don't know that?

29:13.840 --> 29:15.456
Hell, even I know that
and I don't even go to church.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.096
You don't know that's
the pastor's daughter? Damn.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.963
Sinner! Devil.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.530
You know I don't know no pastor.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.136
She rolled up on me
like she know me, like...

29:22.160 --> 29:23.656
"Hey, how you doing?"
I don't know her like that.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.016
[Barn]
Mabel, everybody know you, honey.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.565
You been on the news so much.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.325
Barn, you ain't gotta
tell people all my business.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.925
Um, so, what are they doing here?

29:32.080 --> 29:33.491
- I have no idea.
- Oh.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.005
I just opened the door,

29:35.080 --> 29:36.605
- and barn! There was Madea.
- Really?

29:36.680 --> 29:37.761
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.656
I opened the door, she said,
"Happy Haller-ween."

29:39.680 --> 29:41.256
You know how she says "haller"
and everything, so...

29:41.280 --> 29:44.170
Madea, what are you doing here?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.416
What the hell you mean
"what bring you by?" You called me.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.842
Oh. Oh. Um...

29:49.920 --> 29:51.160
I was in...

29:52.240 --> 29:53.526
The neigh...

29:53.600 --> 29:56.206
The neighborhood, and...

29:56.280 --> 29:58.965
I came... I was on my way to walk...

30:00.880 --> 30:05.283
I was in the neighborhood and I came by
to talk to your... Oh.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.362
To spend the... To stay the night.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.284
Oh, I was in the neighborhood,
I came by to stay the night, yeah.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.442
- That's too much to remember.
- Dad.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.205
What? I didn't...
I didn't know. I had no idea.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.169
I had no idea she was coming.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.969
- But isn't it great?
- No!

30:19.040 --> 30:20.376
Now you have somebody
to be here with you all night.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.926
- That's great.
- Happy Haller-ween.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.082
- Thanks, Dad.
- [whispering] Thank you.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.891
Listen, thank you for
having us over here, Brian.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.176
- Okay?
- [Brian] I'll see you later.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.964
Hey, where the hell the liquor at?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.008
- [door shuts]
- I was so worried at my house.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.970
You know, I'm scared of everything.
Scared of everything.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.281
And this Halloween stuff
just give me the creeps.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.408
She don't like...
She don't like Haller-ween.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.970
Mmm-mmm. Don't like it at all.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.776
It just give me the creeps.
But now I'm all right.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.056
- 'Cause we all here together.
- All here together.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.809
- That's right.
- Together.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.296
Okay, well, I'm tired of talking
to you old people,

30:48.320 --> 30:50.004
so I'm gonna go upstairs.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.207
Nice to meet you!

30:56.040 --> 30:58.416
[Joe] There's something inside me
that want to go grab that girl

30:58.440 --> 31:00.966
and slap the shit out of her.
But I'm not gonna do it.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.844
Oh, it's getting late.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.843
We gotta hurry if we're gonna
catch this party.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.565
This makes me so mad.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.082
I can't believe my dad got all these
old people here to watch me.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.730
Oh, it's not that bad.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.041
You know, Ms. Barn
kinda reminds me of my grandma.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.202
She always gets
really scared on Halloween.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.487
Starts talkin' 'bout
the devil and what not.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.085
But then she just goes to sleep early.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.924
She just wants the day to be over with.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.522
Wait, no, that's it.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.967
We're gonna trick them
into going to bed early.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.441
Trick them?
What do you mean, trick them?

31:33.520 --> 31:36.364
We're gonna scare the hell out of 'em.
Okay, listen, Aday.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.522
When I tell you to press this,
you press it, 'kay?

31:40.240 --> 31:41.651
Is this a bomb or something?

31:41.720 --> 31:43.609
No, it's not a bomb,
it controls the lights.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.250
- Oh, thank God.
- Come on.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.016
I thought we were blowing
old people up today.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.041
No.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.720
I'm tryin' to make it
to heaven, Tiffany.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.568
They got a nice wood-burning fire.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.207
Yeah, people don't have no
wood-burning fireplaces no more.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.282
Everything's gas now, these children.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.091
We done got gas on everything.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.003
- Did good.
- [Tiffany] Hey.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.242
Look what I brought home from school.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.124
What... What the hell is that?

32:08.200 --> 32:10.009
It's a ghost board, Grandpa.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.242
Get that... Get that
on the hell on out of here.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.481
[Barn]
No, ma'am. Uh-uh.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.656
Get that devilment out of here.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.681
[Madea] Right.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.082
No, it's fun.
It's how you communicate with the dead.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.256
You heard her.
Get it on out of here, honey.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.726
We don't play with stuff like that.
Get that up out of here.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.211
No, it's fun!

32:27.280 --> 32:30.090
I'ma tell you right now, if you open it,
that's what you're gonna be.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.696
Dead. You're gonna be
on the other side.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.056
We not playing with stuff
like that, honey.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.480
We don't play with stuff like that.
Give me... Put this down.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.416
What is that that fell out of the thing?

32:40.440 --> 32:41.976
What is that? I don't touch this stuff.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.080
I grew up in New Orleans,
they got voodoo everywhere.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.167
No.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.801
It's a card. It says, "Death."

32:53.720 --> 32:55.449
Oh, no.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.488
Ain't no "oh, no."
I'ma tell you right now.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.736
See, y'all children
don't understand.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.256
Let me make this
perfectly clear to you, honey.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.406
You don't be playing around.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.696
Keep playing with the devil,
he gonna show up.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.610
Yeah, he gonna show up. He's sittin'
right there in front of you.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.210
[exhales]

33:08.280 --> 33:10.400
I tell you right now,
don't play with me, little girl.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.496
That's what you gonna look like,

33:11.520 --> 33:13.648
just like that damn skeleton
on that card.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.603
Doin' a pirouette.
You understand? Go to bed.

33:16.520 --> 33:21.128
You don't understand.
This card comes from Mr. Wilson.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.727
The man that died
in this house on Halloween.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.771
He killed his entire family and put
all of their bodies in the attic.

33:28.840 --> 33:35.007
And it's said that every Halloween
he comes back to take a life.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.402
And the only place he doesn't go
in this house are the bedrooms.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.642
Because that's where
the priests used to sleep

33:40.720 --> 33:42.404
when this house was a monastery.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.244
- Whoa.
- I know.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.609
So we should all go to sleep.
It's safer there, anyways.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.365
The ghosts come out at midnight.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.171
Okay. Time for me to go.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.736
- [Madea] Barn.
- I gotta get out of here.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.524
Bam, hold the hell on.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.090
- Barn.
- What?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.491
What the hell's wrong with you?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.409
Mabel, did you hear what she just said?

34:02.480 --> 34:03.641
- Barn.
- What?

34:03.720 --> 34:05.324
You forgot your canes.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.765
- On!
- On!

34:07.320 --> 34:08.764
Joe!

34:08.840 --> 34:11.241
But ain't God good?
I don't even need my canes, Mabel.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.690
- [Madea] Sit down!
- Mabel.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.976
Hell, we been helpin' you for days,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.416
and you sittin' there actin' like
somethin' wrong with you.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.775
Ain't nothing wrong with you. Sit down!

34:16.800 --> 34:17.801
Yes.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.376
This girl ain't doin'
nothin' but sitting here lyin'.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.243
No, I'm not.
I'm telling the truth!

34:21.320 --> 34:23.576
Girl, if you don't get up out
of here with that devilment,

34:23.600 --> 34:26.080
I mean, you better get to steppin'.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.844
I'm telling you. I'm going to bed.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.407
'Cause after 10:00, strange things
start happening in this house.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.165
[whispering]
Strange things.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.616
No. I ain't gonna even be
able to do this.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.803
I can't I got...
That's gonna blow my high.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.485
High... You smoke marijuana?

34:41.600 --> 34:44.080
I got a prescription!

34:44.159 --> 34:46.606
You, little girl,
stay in a child's place.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.331
Mabel, I gotta get outta here.
I'm scared, and I gotta

34:49.440 --> 34:51.176
- get outta here, now!
- Calm down, Bam. Bam!

34:51.199 --> 34:52.565
Calm the hell down.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.244
This girl is lyin'.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.681
I'm gonna go to bed.
Don't let the ghosts get you.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.125
Be on outta here.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.971
She lyin'. Hold on!

35:01.760 --> 35:02.921
What? Oh.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.610
[all screaming]

35:10.520 --> 35:11.760
I'ma fuck you up!

35:13.400 --> 35:14.890
What the hell was that?

35:14.960 --> 35:16.325
I'm sorry.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.736
[Madea]
What happened to the lights?

35:17.760 --> 35:19.569
Help me, Jesus.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.165
[whispering]
That was Mr. Wilson.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.336
[Madea] Girl, get out of here.
You ain't doin' nothin' but lyin'.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.885
Hell, that was just...
That was just...

35:24.960 --> 35:26.456
That was just...
That was just power...

35:26.480 --> 35:29.689
Power... P... That was just...
That was just the power acting up.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.489
- Okay, well, goodnight.
- Go to bed!

35:31.560 --> 35:32.776
[stuttering]
Go to bed, girl, hell.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.211
All right.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.203
[stuttering]
Sittin' there tellin' all them lies.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.810
- Come on, Aday.
- I'm scared.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.882
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.323
Dea, Dea, I'm scared.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.368
- [Hattie] Me too.
- Bam, calm the hell down.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.487
Calm the hell down.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.801
[tapping]

35:58.920 --> 36:01.526
- Tiffany, come on!
- It's time to go.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.682
Shh! Don't wake the old people!

36:08.000 --> 36:10.526
Okay, gonna fix the bed.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.616
- Fix the bed. Pull this down.
- What are we doing to the bed?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.256
We're gonna make it look like
we're sleeping in here.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.930
Oh.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.969
- Like a body?
- Yeah, like a body.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.201
Okay.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.563
Wait, over there. Here. Okay.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.244
That looks like you been eatin' good.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.800
Wait, hold on.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.530
Okay. Let's sneak down the back stairs.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.887
- Oh, I don't know about this.
- Come on.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.044
- Close the door.
- Okay.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.921
Good Lord.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.881
Hmm.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.522
This damn girl has snuck up
out of this damn house!

37:13.600 --> 37:15.250
Bam, y'all ain't gonna believe this.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.696
Y'all ain't gonna believe this at all.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.085
[Hattie] What that, Ma?

37:18.160 --> 37:19.656
That girl has snuck up
out of this house.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.681
- Uh-uh.
- No!

37:20.800 --> 37:22.564
Yes, she did.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.005
Well, where's she going to?

37:24.080 --> 37:25.536
Probably over there to that frat party.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.800
I knew it.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.566
You talkin' 'bout over there where
all them fine, sexy college men's be?

37:30.640 --> 37:32.051
Hattie...

37:32.120 --> 37:33.645
Let's ride.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.926
Come on, Joe.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.571
No, you go on, I'm gonna stay here
and pray for her safe return.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.529
Hey, hey. Hey, come here, come here.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.409

37:44.560 --> 37:46.767

37:46.840 --> 37:48.376
Why you gotta be all stingy
'cause you legal, baby?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.401
Come on, help me out.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.962
Joe, I got a prescription for this here.
I don't have any for you.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.481
The Lord gonna bless you, you share.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.801
[groans]
You make me so sick!

37:57.920 --> 38:00.321
Here, Joe. This... You owe me.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.041
All right. When you come back,
I'll tap that ass for you.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.089
In that case, you gonna be payin' me.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.770

Go ahead on, then. I'll be here,
waitin' for y'all to get back.

38:19.800 --> 38:24.362
Prayin' for her safe return.
That the Lord will bless her.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.885
Hey, I need a lighter!

38:25.960 --> 38:27.849

38:32.640 --> 38:34.324
[Barn]
Wait, Mabel, stop it!

38:34.400 --> 38:36.084
[Madea]
I know, I know, damn well...

38:36.160 --> 38:37.764
Let's get out of the car here.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.656
[Hattie] You didn't have to be
jacking my neck like that.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.967
Damn! What, it backfired.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.644
You know my brakes is bad, Hattie.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.245
Hey, what the hell does that mean?

Uh... Lord, have mercy.
Look at these children.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.764
[Hattie] Look at all these fine,

38:56.840 --> 38:59.002
Girl, leave...
Hattie, leave them children alone.

38:59.080 --> 39:02.209
What, Ma? You know I don't mind buying
two or three college books for these...

39:02.280 --> 39:03.776
Well, somebody gonna throw

39:03.800 --> 39:04.976
Leave these little boys alone.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.096
[Barn]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.770
What the hell is that?

39:07.840 --> 39:09.569

39:15.000 --> 39:16.525
I didn't piss in my pants!

39:16.600 --> 39:18.016
Don't do that

39:18.040 --> 39:19.376
- Get on in the house.
- I said I'm Peter Pan!

39:19.400 --> 39:21.016
Go on up in there

41:51.640 --> 41:53.256
Do your mama know

She picked out my outfit.

I just unplugged the damn music.
And I'ma tell you right now.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.363
[indistinct chattering]

46:42.880 --> 46:45.326
All right. She's gone.
Will she call the police?

46:45.400 --> 46:49.007
No. She's got lots of warrants.
She's crazy but she's not that crazy.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.368
Look, Tiff, we love you and Aday, but...

46:52.440 --> 46:54.329
We just don't like the drama.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.051
Well, I'm sorry that my dad is so lame.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.407
Well, we just can't hang out
and have this happen again.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.881
Well, it won't happen again.
I promise.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.327
This is why we said that,
you know, you shouldn't come.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.323
It's 'cause your dad's
gonna flip, dude.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.136
And, you know, now Jonathan is missing
his party, it's kind of unfair.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.207
Yeah.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.203
Well, don't worry about Jonathan.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.327
I'll make it up to him.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.167
Bye.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.289
Listen, I'm so sorry about all of this.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.442
Yo, Tiffany, it's all good,

47:28.520 --> 47:30.727
but are you sure she's not
gonna call the police?

47:30.800 --> 47:34.088
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm surprised
they even left the house.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.687
I was telling them this story
about how the house is haunted.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.136
Oh, you should have
seen their eyes.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.527
They were, like, scared.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.365
- Really?
- Yes.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.205
Oh! All right. Tell me more.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.883
Oh, Lord.
I think I want to go home.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.849
Yeah, me too. Home run.

47:55.920 --> 47:59.242
Knock you out the park.
I'm talking fifth base.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.800
Is there even a fifth base?
What is that?

What are you freaking out for?
Come on.

48:03.960 --> 48:05.803
I'm not. What do you mean?

48:05.880 --> 48:08.042
We'll get weird on each other.
What do you say?

48:08.120 --> 48:09.929

- Yes.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.129
Years old?

48:16.200 --> 48:17.964
- Yeah.
- In human years.

Yes.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.004
[screaming]

48:24.920 --> 48:28.970

Seventeen years old!

48:32.320 --> 48:34.448
I'm mad as hell.
I'm mad as hell!

48:34.520 --> 48:37.046
Gonna throw me down in them bushes,
and Bam, you sitting there,

48:37.120 --> 48:38.536
sitting there getting' high
with them damn boys.

48:38.560 --> 48:39.856
And Barn, you wasn't even
gonna help me?

48:39.880 --> 48:42.850
You supposed to be fightin' for me.
Y'all was supposed to have my back. Oh!

48:42.920 --> 48:44.081
Mabel, I got your back.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.004
I always have, always had your back,
but I'm high, Mabel.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.856
Somebody needs to call the police,
that's all I know.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.291
Somebody need to call the po-po.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.056
You so damn worried about her,
you call 'em.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.445
Hell, I'm trying to sleep.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.016
Oh, no, I can't do that, I got warrants.

48:55.040 --> 48:59.409
- Mabel, call them anonymously.
- That's what got me in trouble!

48:59.480 --> 49:01.416
Because anonymously is how
I was writing them checks

49:01.440 --> 49:04.205
and dealing with them
credit card frauds. I can't do that.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.416
Somebody else got to call 'em.

49:05.440 --> 49:09.843
I can't call them neither, Ma.
They know my voice, too.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.456
Well, you know damn well
they know mine.

49:11.480 --> 49:14.006
Ma, why don't you just go
describe your voice?

49:14.080 --> 49:16.481
- Do what?
- Describe your voice.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.050
The word is not "describe," honey.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.256
If I describe my voice
then they gonna know it's me talkin'.

49:20.280 --> 49:23.250
It is "disguise."
And I can't disguise my voice.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.209
Because they have voice
data recognition.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.521
I'm on the terrorist list, too.
I'm on terrorist watch.

49:27.600 --> 49:28.931
They recognize it.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.240
[groaning]

49:30.360 --> 49:32.203
I'll call 'em, hell.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.971
How much damn stuff
you got up in them breasts?

49:37.040 --> 49:40.169
I bet you take all that stuff
out and breasts is just flat.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.607
Barn, you high,
what you gonna say before you call 'em?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.480
Uh... Yeah!

49:45.560 --> 49:47.616
Wait a minute, hell,
you gonna call 'em like Lil Jon?

49:47.640 --> 49:49.722
No, I'm gonna call 'em
like a little white girl.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.524
Oh. You a little white girl?

49:51.600 --> 49:53.682
Barn, you ain't never been
little in your life.

49:53.800 --> 49:56.007
And she never been white, either.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.250
What you gonna say when you call 'em?

49:58.320 --> 50:02.245
Yeah, listen, we need the police.

50:02.320 --> 50:07.326
I'm being held against my will.
Help me! Help me!

50:09.440 --> 50:12.091
Ma, it's something wrong with her.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.003
Really, really wrong.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.845
Barn. Listen to me, honey,
make this perfectly clear.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.491
Just call the people and tell them...
Listen to me.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.244
Just tell them that an underage girl

50:21.320 --> 50:23.920
snuck out the house and she at
a frat party. Don't do all of that.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.962
Okay, Mabel.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.929
- Yo, stop, stop!
- Pull the rip cord, bro!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.731
- What the hell, don't you knock?
- Look, somethings wrong with Aday,

50:30.840 --> 50:32.536
- she just ran out of here.
- Where did she go?

50:32.560 --> 50:35.006
- I don't know!
- Well, what happened?

50:35.080 --> 50:37.606
I told her to get the hell out.
She's 17.

50:37.720 --> 50:40.564
And so is this broad fraud right here.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.603
Are you crazy?
We could all go to jail!

50:42.680 --> 50:47.242
Hold up, she's not 17.
Does this look like a 17-year-old?

50:51.360 --> 50:52.964
Are you 17?

50:53.520 --> 50:55.090
- Yes.
- Oh!

50:55.160 --> 50:56.605
Tiffany, that's just...

50:56.680 --> 50:58.808
- Tiffany, that's just wrong!
- I know. I'm sorry.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.167
No! We can all get kicked out
of school for this.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.402
- I'm sorry!
- Wait, how old are you guys?

51:03.480 --> 51:04.527
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

51:04.600 --> 51:05.886
Cool, cool.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.651
Oh, I know.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.160
We can't let 'em get away with this.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.376
You know, it was our own fault,

52:19.400 --> 52:21.016
they shouldn't have been here
in the first place.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.246
Would you mind shutting up?

52:22.320 --> 52:23.845
This is not our fault and I refuse

52:23.920 --> 52:27.083

deny this frat's reputation.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.207

Hattie, what the hell wrong with you?

52:51.800 --> 52:55.566

scratchin' up my wall.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.210
Girl, go on with that, hell.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.567
I think it's that man
that killed his whole family.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.642
I think it's Mr. Wilson, Ma.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.484

53:09.480 --> 53:11.289
Listen, listen, would you hush?

53:11.360 --> 53:13.456
[Madea] Yes. Please, Hattie.
Ain't no ghosts in this house.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.136
Ain't no ghost gonna be
knocking on the damn door.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.050
Does that make sense to you?
A ghost that damn knock on the door?

53:18.120 --> 53:20.407

53:20.480 --> 53:22.130
Bam, go open that door.

Uh-uh.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.489
You scared, Mabel.

Go open the door.
Go open the door, Mabel.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.604
I'm tired right now.
Uh, Joe, open the door.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.336
Hell, I ain't going to that door,
this ain't my house.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.696
I ain't goin' nowhere near that door.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.360
- Go on and get it, bruh.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.289

- Oh, no.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.283
- Hattie, what the hell is it?
- Oh, no, Ma.

53:48.360 --> 53:51.250
- What is it, Hattie?
- You see somethin' scary at the door?

53:51.320 --> 53:52.560
What is it?

53:52.640 --> 53:54.210
[whispers] It's white men.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.361
[Madea] What?

53:55.440 --> 53:56.805
You see white people?

53:58.600 --> 54:00.841
[both screaming]

54:00.920 --> 54:02.251
Girl, that's the po-po, here.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.482
- Hide the stuff!
- Get the stuff...

54:04.560 --> 54:06.562
Oh, hell, I ain't got nothing.
[chuckles]

54:06.680 --> 54:08.444
We ain't got nothin' to hide.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.205
That took me back in the day when
the po-po used to come round here,

54:11.280 --> 54:13.169
and everybody would be
just duckin', runnin'.

54:13.240 --> 54:14.480
Them was the good old days.

54:14.560 --> 54:17.370
Oh, man, please.
I got a prescription, I'm good.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.816
Okay, well, Bam, go open the door.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.171
Why I gotta open the door?

54:20.240 --> 54:22.720
'Cause you got a prescription, you good.
Go open the door here.

Well, did you check my dad's room?
Because that's where I was.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.456
Why would you be up in his room when
you supposed to be in your own room?

56:10.480 --> 56:13.563
Well, sometimes my room gets cold.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

56:55.160 --> 56:58.767
Mr. Wilson,

56:58.840 --> 57:02.049
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to get him to leave you alone.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.646
And they say it gets cold when he's mad.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.848

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.681
- You scared, ain't you?
- I am not scared.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.296
- [Barn] Mabel...
- Honey, I'm not scared.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.288
Mabel, why are you up here in this bed?

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.283
[Hattie]
With your good running church shoes.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.091
Mabel, you got every light on in here.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.571
I was reading.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.641
[both] Reading what?

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.290
I was trying to read the Bible.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.250
- You weren't reading no Bible, Ma!
- Where is the Bible?

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.164
It's on the table in my heart.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.924
Mabel, we gotta get out of here.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.968
- [loud crashing]
- [all gasping]

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.011
- Okay.
- I'm having a...

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.656
- Did that come from the attic?
- [Hattie] Yeah.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.127
Did she say he was in the attic?
Get the hell on up out of here!

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.083
Y'all get the hell up out of here!

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.246
[Bam] Mabel.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.322
Y'all know I can't
run down these stairs.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.811
What the hell?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.805
Now, Joe, stop playing games
on these old ladies up there!

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.764
I ain't playing no damn jokes.
I'm playing with myself.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.656
Joe, I know it's you.
I know you're down here doin' it.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.126
Look, everybody out here out of breath.
Can't breathe at all.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.771
Bam tired running down the stairs.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.080
Damn, you out of shape.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.130
How the hell you get this out of breath
running down the stairs, Bam?

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.646
Now Joe, stop it.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.296
Now, y'all come on, we only got
a few more hours to be in this house.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.936
Now, come on, let's go on
up there and go to bed.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.610
- [loud crashing]
- [all gasp]

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.163
- Madea! You heard that, Ma?
- I heard hollering like a damn fool.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.568
- Ma, I know you heard it upstairs.
- No, I didn't. I didn't hear nothing.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.689
Yes, you did, Ma. You know, they say
that's where he killed

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.730
his whole entire family,
up in the attic.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.204
Joe, you see these ladies is worried.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.216
Get up and be a man and go on up there
and check and see what's in the attic.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.366
Bitch, please.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.681
Mabel, come on, take me home.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.167
Hey, I'll take all you hoes to a hotel,

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.368
if you hoes don't tell.
[laughs]

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.010
Shut the hell up!

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.251
Ma, go on up there
and see what's going on.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.368
I'm gonna stay down here with Joe.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.044
Me too.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.360
[Madea] I'm gonna go.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.924
- I ain't scared.
- Okay, great.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.047
I ain't never scared.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.724
- You're not scared.
- I'm never scared.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.096
- Then go up there then.
- I'm going up there.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.360
- You bad.
- I'm never scared.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.283
- You bad.
- I'm bad. Who's bad?

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.522
- I ain't scared of nothing!
- Okay, great.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.443
The hell I got up here
making all this noise?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.364
Probably nothing but these pipes
rattling like they do in my house.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.124
I don't know what's going on up here.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.645
Okay, great. Bye, Mabel.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.376
- I ain't scared. I'll be back.
- Okay, great.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.050
- Bye, Mabel.
- Okay, great.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.208
If she don't come back I just
want y'all to know, that's a dude.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.009
I wanna go home, Mabel.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.444
I ain't scared of nothing.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.645
I ain't scared of nothing.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.689
I ain't never been scared of nothing.
I've been big all my life.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.762
I had to be brave.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.687
All my life I had to fight.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.044
I ain't never thought
I'd have to fight in Brian's house.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.204
Ain't nobody up here.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.564
Nobody. Ain't nobody up here.
Hey, ain't nobody up here.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.169
[wind howling]

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.411
[metal clattering]

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.606
I don't see nothing.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.368
Yeah, ain't nothing up here.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.126
Got all these crazy-looking costumes
and everything, ain't nothing up here.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.089
[floor creaking]

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.164
[shallow breathing]

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.129
Damn clown was back there.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.329
I know the damn clown did not just
move from where it was.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.525
- [roars]
- [screams]

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.124
Madea, you think she's all right?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.170
- Ain't nothing to worry about.
- [Madea screaming]

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.480
What? What?

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.284
Oh, Jesus. Ma!

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.010
Mabel, are you all right?

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.696
I thought there were a herd of buffalo
coming down the damn stairs.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.520
- Shaking up the whole damn house.
- Dea, what happened?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.444
We got to go to my house.
We got to get the hell up out of here.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.681
I thought you'd never ask!

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.127
- Yes. Yes. Let's go.
- Ma, let's ride!

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.241
[screams]

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.656
What the hell is wrong with you, Hattie?

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.841
[Barn] Uh-uh.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.524
- Ah... Look!
- I don't see nothing!

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.726
I'm not gonna fall for that.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.245
There's a clown.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.685
[gasps] You saw a clown?

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.683
- Yes.
- What'd he look like?

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.004
Oh, a dirty-looking clown.
He's a crazy-looking clown!

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.208
I saw one upstairs in the attic, too.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.282
I'm looking at three damn clowns.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.330
Put y'all three side by side,
you shaped like a one-oh-one.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.050
Get the hell on up out of here.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.361
Joe, I'm telling you there's
something in this house.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.283
I gotta get out of here.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.522
We got to go.
We got to go.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.284
I don't see nothing. He gone.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.407
- Yeah.
- I know.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.164
- [both scream]
- Mabel!

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.616
I'm getting ready to choke
the hell out of her.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.404
- I'm gonna punch her dead.
- Mabel.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.041
Hey, girl, I'm getting ready to clog
your esophagus. Shut up!

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.326
It moved!

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.767
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It moved!

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.649
Yeah, if something is behind me...

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.324
- Mabel. Oh, Lord!
- I'm gonna...

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.607
I'm telling you right now, girl...
There's some... What?

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.682
Mabel, no! No, look!

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.491
- [shallow breathing]
- What's that breathing?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.087
It's a clown, Ma!

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.731
[Barn] I don't like no clown.
[whimpering]

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.322
[all screaming]

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.243
Run! Run!

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.846
Get the hell out the door!
Get the hell out the door!

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.256
- [Barn] Mabel!
- [indistinct shouting]

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.805
Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.805
Hell no! Hell no!
Hell no, girl! Hell no!

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.769
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.536
Get in the car, Hattie!
Get in the car, Bam!

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.164
[Hattie] Come on, Bam!

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.696
Get in the car!
Get in my car! Get in the car!

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.530
Open my door! Y'all know
I had hip surgery!

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.125
Mabel, be careful!

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.611
[moaning]

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.801
- Why we just sitting here?
- I forgot the keys, girl.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.803
Ah! Hotwire it!

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.611
Barn, what kind of lady
do you think I am?

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.643
I'm a lady, I don't know
how to hotwire a car.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.441
Who the hell do you think I am,
some kind of common criminal?

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.643
Well, that's all you had to say,
I got you on that, Ma.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.530
- Me too, girl, you know I know how...
- Wait! Wait!

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.604
Are we just gonna leave the girl
in the house with the clown?

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.736
[Madea] Listen, let me tell you
right now, that's Joe's grandchild.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.015
I ain't got nothing to do with her.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.404
She already got a nasty attitude,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.562
it's every clown for himself.
Hotwire this.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.687
[electricity crackling]

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.816
- [engine starts]
- [both scream]

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.285
Oh, Joe, don't do that!

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.761
The hell?
Joe, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.046
<i>Hey.</i>

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.055
The hell is wrong with you? I was about
to bust your face with this damn gun.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.536
I don't know where the hell
you think you're going.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.609
You left these in the house. You left
your purse and everything up in there.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.330
- Here.
- Give me my keys.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.607
Where are you going without them?

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.240
- I don't know.
- [man on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.216
And this phone of yours
been ringing off the hook.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.810
- Hello?
- I was up in there...

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.376
Burning up your minutes
and somebody's on the phone.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:50.856
<i>- Is anybody there?
- Who is it on the phone?</i>

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.167
It's some preacher on the phone
working on my nerve!

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.163
Hell! Preacher. Pray for that.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.729
- Here.
- [Madea] What?

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.848
Leave me the hell alone.
I'm going to lay down.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:03.566
[cell phone ringing]

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.529
- Who is this?
- Don't answer that, Ma!

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.376
Mabel, don't answer that.
I saw it in a movie.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.856
When you answer that thing,
the little girl...

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.803
When she answered the phone,
she got dead.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.564
I remember that.
She said "Hello" and that thing said,

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.323
"Are you in the house alone?"

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.368
- I remember that.
- Yes.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.885
Don't answer.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.291
It's all right.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:21.399
- Don't answer it!
- Don't.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:22.576
- Don't answer it.
- [man on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.840
But I hear somebody.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.095
<i>- Is anybody there?
- You say there's somebody...</i>

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.484
Who is it?
Who the hell is it?

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.448
<i>- This is Reverend Walker.
- Hey, Reverend.</i>

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.602
- Hello, Madea.
- Reverend, look here.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.055
If you calling to pray for me,
I ain't got no time for that right now.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.606
- Well, a little prayer would be good.
- Bam, hush.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.205
Okay, go and pray, Rev, go and pray.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.850
<i>- Oh, Lord.
- Praise Jesus!</i>

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.365
<i>Help us all to find peace!</i>

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.283
I'm gonna make him pray harder,
watch this.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:43.645
Hallelujah!

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.881
<i>Hallelujah! Wool!</i>

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.803
[laughs] He prayed harder.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.291
<i>Come bring your...</i>

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:49.776
Look he started... [laughs]
He started prayin' hard.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.723
What is it, Reverend?
All right, enough.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.245
Amen, Jesus wept. What is it?

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.481
<i>Have you seen Aday?</i>

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.244
No, she's up in the house with...

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.970
- No, she's not. No.
- She's not?

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.883
- I know you lying to me.
- No, I'm not.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.616
Reverend, please don't
make me cuss on this phone.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.847
<i>- You need to come to the church.
- Okay, fine.</i>

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.576
<i>- Come on down to the church.
- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.656
- Madea. Now, Madea, <i>come on...</i>
- Well, what the Rev want?

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.056
That girl snuck out of this house
and went down to that frat party.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.321
That damn Tiffany done lied again!

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.370
The Reverend want me to come over to
the church so he can talk to me.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.760
That won't be a bad idea at all.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.496
A little prayer won't hurt
nobody right now.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.016
Barn, I'm not going up
in there for no prayer.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.456
I'm going up in there
to set this straight.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.767
This child, she gonna need
more than a little prayer.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.605
She gonna need the damn clown
and everything in there to help her

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.016
when I get back here,
I'm telling you right now.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.480
'Cause I'm not gonna deal with this.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.056
And Mr. Wilson and a clown, that's
gonna be the least of her worries.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.402
Well, wait a minute, Ma, we just gonna
leave the girl up in there, right there?

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.720
What the hell else we gonna do?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.336
I'm not going
back up in there to get her.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.600
[tires screeching]

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.603
[mumbling]

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.287
What the hell?

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.410
Go on somewhere with that, clown.
Coming up here with that bullshit.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.005
Go on, clown, go on.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.127
[floorboards creaking]

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.449
[wind whistling]

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.536
Ain't nothing over there,
that's it, I'm telling you.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.528
There ain't nobody in here with me.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.487
[exhales sharply]

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.768
That's what I know.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.763
[floorboards creaking]

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.649
[shallow breathing]

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.446
Like that?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.041
Yeah.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.041
[grunts]

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.850
I don't play that Halloween bullshit!

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.447
Blowing my damn high,
coming up in here with a clown costume.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.409
I did that already tonight.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.724
- [Barn] Mabel!
- [Hattie] Yeah.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.216
[Madea] Got me going
out here to church, you know?

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.924
And that damn Aday
wasn't even up there.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.096
You wait till I get back home,
deal with that girl.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.406
That's crazy <i>as</i> hell.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.925
[Bam] She is something else, Mabel.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.136
[Madea]
I'm gonna fix her though, she's...

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.456
That clown gonna be the least of
her worries when I get back there.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.216
[Barn] Well, Mabel,

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.811

- [engine sputtering]
- [Madea] What the hell?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.125
What the hell's wrong

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.096
- [Hattie] Mabel! [whimpers]
- [Bam] Mabel! Jesus!

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.088
What the hell is wrong with it?

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.686
I don't know, I'm pressing the gas.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.603
Oh, now it's goin'...
Now it's goin' backwards.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.489
What in hell wrong with it?

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.369
" Ma!
<i>'</i> Stop it!

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.680
What the hell is wrong with it?

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.056
- Put it in drive.
- [engine backfires]

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.809
Baby, don't cut it off!

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.406
I didn't cut the damn car off,

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.845
The hell is wrong with this thing?

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.046
[Bam coughing]

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.690
Let me look up under the hood.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.696
I told you, I know Joe
did something to my damn car,

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.416
that's why I never let him
go borrow my car.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.010
Ma, we gonna wait right here for you.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.004
Hattie, get your ass out of the car,
come help me. Bam, get out.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.656
Mabel, I'm not getting
out of this car right now.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.176
[Madea] It takes two people
to open this hood.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.486
Come on, help me open it.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.369
Ma, we caught here
in these damn woods!

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.841
- Come, help me open the hood, girl.
- Oh, Lord.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.490
Help me open, you've got to pry it up.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.042
Come on, on the count of three.
Count of three. Look. One, two, three.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.003
Whoo! Yeah!

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.606
When's the last time
you had this thing serviced?

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.648
1972, when I bought it.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.000
[animal howling]

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.645
What's wrong with it?

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.724
We don't know, Barn, hell,
we just got out the car!

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.566
- The hell's wrong with her?
- Ma, I'm scared out here.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.496
You scared in the house,
you scared in the dark, hush.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.806
Ain't nothing out here.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.770
No, you know I don't like to be out here
in the dark in these here woods.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.080
Nothing wrong with these woods,

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.600
hell, ain't nothing out there.
Hattie, just hush.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.761
Shh!

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.683
Is everybody all right?

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.401
Barn, we fine. Hell, we fine,
would you please be quiet?

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.891
Damn, what the hell wrong with her?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.525
Mabel.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.925
I hear something out there.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.480
You don't hear nothing, Hattie. Hell.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.965
Look, is this the carburetor?

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.800
I don't know nothing about
working on no car.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.922
[low growling]

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.445
[Hattie] Ma.

Oh, hell, Oh, hell. Hell!

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.971
[screaming]

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.123
[Hattie] Madea! Madea!

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.888

Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.047
[panting]

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.081
Help me, Jesus!

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.891
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.883
- Help me, Jesus!
- [door opens]

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.200
I need Jesus!

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.725
Oh, Lord, somebody help me,

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.576
I just need Jesus,
come, somebody pray for me.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.001
What'd I do, what'd I do?
Somebody just needs to pray for me.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.048
[stammering]
Oh, I need Jesus! I need...

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.527
You can't smoke in here, Madea.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.523
Okay, but didn't Moses
have a burning bush?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.886
I need the lamb of God.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.525
Would you like to be saved, darling?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.648
Oh, yes, I wanna be saved,
will that help me?

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.200
Oh, praise the Lord,
Hallelujah, that's wonderful!

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.523
Now do you believe that
Jesus is the son of God?

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.296
If I have to, that's what
I'm gonna believe.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.721
Just, I just need y'all to help me.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.201
And you confess your sins?

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.056
Up in here with all these
children up in here?

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.243
Honey, you don't want me confessing
my sin up in here around these men.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.163
I'll have all of them blushing.
[laughs]

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.256
You don't know what I used to
do back in the day, baby!

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.681
Wasn't no fun. Bam! [laughs]

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.046
Pray for me.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.567
[stuttering] Well, not to Sister Alice,
not to anybody in here, but to Him.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.936
You just confess with your mouth
and believe in your heart,

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.560
and you shall be saved,
it's that simple.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.136
Oh, just like that
and all my problems go away,

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.016
ain't gonna be no more demons
following me and there's monkeys

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.485
and everything walking behind me?

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.211
Well, getting saved doesn't mean
all your troubles won't come,

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.931
but it'll help you when it do.
I'm a living witness now.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.650
I confess that Jesus is son of God.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.564
I believe. Sha-na-na!
Yes, I believe, help me.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.051
Am I saved? I'm saved now!

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.770
- Yes...
- Yes, I'm saved!

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.888
Yes, praise the Lord, I'm saved.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.928
- [applause]
- Yes, Hallelujah. Thank you.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.083
Them demons that I keep seeing
and monkeys and clowns...

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.606
They've been following you. I know.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.966
[Madea sighs]

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.884
Reverend, you anointed just like TDJ.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.962
How you know that, Reverend?
How you know that?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.883
Uh... Aday told me.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.325
[Madea] How she know that?

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.643
Baby, you got the gift like Joel Osteen,
you got the gift, baby?

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.690
I have a confession. I...

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.888
We snuck out of the house
and went to the frat party.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.045
I'm so sorry, Madea.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.043
I already asked the Lord
for forgiveness.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.600
But when you came
to the party and shut it down,

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.284
the frat guys got so mad.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.885
And they wanted to prank you.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.610
They hacked into the TV.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.809
The lights. The plumbing.
That was all them.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.376
I heard them talking about it
when the police came to shut it down.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.643
And when you were in the car
and the zombies came out of the woods,

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.801
that was them.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.927
[softly] Yes, ma'am.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.285
[groans]

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.249
Come on, get some holy water. Come on.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.124
[groaning]

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.043
Jesus working on her,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.690
- Now hold that.
- Hallelujah, Jesus.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.650
No, no, them words is about to come
out of my mouth, but I'm in a church!

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.256
- Come on, now, hold it. Hold.
- You better...

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.770
[mumbles]

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.126
Oh, Lord.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.407
Sorry, these words trying to
come up out of my...

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.007
Don't cuss, Madea, you in a church,
hold yourself. Don't cuss.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.367
- I bind you, cussing demon!
- Bind him.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.807
Cussing demon, I bind you!

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.042
You trying to tell me right now,

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.202
that that was them children
that did that?

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.647
To me? And the clown?

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.121
That was them.
And the movement in the attic.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.326
I'm sorry, Miss Madea.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.323
You ain't nowhere near
as sorry as them

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.256
frat boys about to be
for what they done did to me.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.161
No, no, Miss Madea, Tiffany has
some responsibility in this, I'm sorry.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.616
[Madea] I'm gonna tell you right now.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.256
I'm going over there and I'm gonna burn
that place down. I'm going right now!

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.169
You just got saved, Miss Madea.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.130
Sometimes getting saved
is like a bad perm, Reverend...

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.850
[male voice]
It just don't take.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.400
[normal voice]
Now where them boys at?

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.736
I'm going over there
to get them right now.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.171
Uh... Uh... Miss Madea...

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.296
Reverend, I know
you ain't grabbing on me.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.401
I know you ain't...

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.845
Do you want them holy hands?

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.048
Do you want your holy hands, Reverend?

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.170
I think you just need to calm down.
The Bible says to turn the other cheek.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.816
Yes, but the Bible
talks about these cheeks.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.136
What about the cheeks
down at the bottom?

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.936
Those are the ones I'm going after
'cause I'm gonna tell you right now.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.776
What they done did is just absolute,
flat-out wrong.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.896
I'm going over there and set it off.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.016
No, no, no. Miss Madea,
there's gotta be some other way

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.201
to teach them a lesson.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.282
- [Hattie screaming]
- [crowd gasping]

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.325
[Barn]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.289
Ma, you ain't had
to leave us like that.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.646
I know y'all knew where to come.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.296
They came straight to the church,
didn't they?

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.846
Listen. Hold on. I just
found out what happened.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.729
It was them frat boys, but listen to me.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.882
I got this. Rev, you might be right.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.376
There might be something
we can go over there and do

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.925
- and get all this straight.
- Yes.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.240
I got... I got an idea.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.085
I'm going to try something
very different.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.525
This is what we gonna do...

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.360
I oughta bust you...

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.816
[Madea] Joe, you ain't gonna
believe this.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.216
You ain't gonna believe
what them frat boys did.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.176
Yeah, I know everything.
I know everything, look here.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.440
[Madea]
I... Hold the hell on.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.971
[Joe] Look at him.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.416
So y'all wanna play games
with old people, huh?

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.010
What is your name, son?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.367
Urn, I'm Renaldo,
but everybody calls me Horse.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.171
Horse? Ooh, can I ride?

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.009
- Hattie, please, damn.
- Hattie, hush.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.496
[Joe] I'm gonna tell you
one more time, Hattie,

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.776
you keep talking to him like that,

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.201
you ain't getting no more
of this damn donkey.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.363
So y'all like to play games, huh?
What is wrong with y'all?

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.761
I'm sorry, we don't wanna get
kicked out of school, please.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.096
You worried about
getting kicked out of school,

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.485
you about to get your ass kicked.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.136
I'm gonna get all this
straight right now.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.367
Y'all wanna play these games?
I'm calling Brian.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.363
- I'm calling right now.
- Yeah.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.771
<i>[Brian]
Madea, how you doing?</i>

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.286
Brian, you ain't gonna never believe
what your daughter did.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.805
I need you to come home right now.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.006
<i>Madea, I don't...</i>

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.176
I don't care what you're doing,
if you don't get here right now,

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.611
you ain't gonna have no house.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.016
- Yes, we gonna get it.
- No, I'm good.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.246
- Right now.
- <i>Okay,</i> great.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.936
And then she just snuck up
out of this house.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.176
That's exactly what she...
Snuck up out of this house, Brian.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.964
I cannot believe that...

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.520
I think that you need to just
shut the hell up and listen, boy.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.296
Right. You need to get that girl to
come down here and put your foot down.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.856
Okay. All right.
But what do I say to her?

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.896
You grab her by the throat,
you say, "Look here, you little..."

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.656
Daddy, if you say something
bad about my daughter...

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.762
Joe, don't you call that child
no bad name, hush.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.001
Call her.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.576
[Madea] You need to call her down here
and set this thing straight.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.921
Get this child in order,
she is running all over you.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.161
You need to get her in order.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.720
- Okay. Tiffany!
- [Tiffany] What?

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.167
Honey, can you come downstairs, please?

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.480
What the hell you doing?

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.921
Boy, what the hell wrong with you?
Call her from your nuts.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.365
[Bam exclaims]

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.001
Well, now that may be how it sounds,
Joe, 'cause, he only got one.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.684
[laughs]

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.842
Boy, I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.161
You're sitting here
like a little me-otch.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.567
Stop using that language
in my house, okay?

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.246
Listen up, everybody here.
I'll try this my way,

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.245
and if it doesn't work,
then I will resort to 1938,

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.210
where you beat the hell out of your kids
and everything was okay.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.805
All right? I'll get arrested.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.564
I'll have warrants.
I'll be like you guys.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.616
I'm running from the police.
I'm running from the po-po.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.210
I don't live that way.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.887
Nigga. Nigga. Your way ain't never work.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.176
We trying to tell you the way
we did it in the old school.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.884
All this new shit ain't working.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.880
That's why all these children
killing each other.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.296
That's why all these children
ain't got no respect for nobody.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.209
This new shit don't work.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.611
Tiffany!

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.200
Tell her you better get your ass down
them steps right damn now.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.525
Get down these stairs right now,
your dad would like to talk to you,

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.002
have a conversation about some of
your behavior, young lady.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.209
Find your way down these stairs,
right now.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.202
Look, she's coming. See? Duh.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.206
What?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.964
Girl, did that child say, "What"?

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.336
Oh, somebody help me,
y'all better hold me.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.441
Somebody better hold me.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.524
Tiffany, hear me clearly
and answer this question, okay?

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.201
Be very careful with your answer.
All right?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.480
'Cause your life may depend on it. Um...

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.050
Did you sneak out of this house

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.521
and go to that frat party
after I told you not to?

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.601
So What if I did?

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.409
I told you not to go.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.051
Mmm. So I did. Get over it.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:41.411
If you don't snatch that heifer up
by her new growth and sling her

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.448
through the air like
a helicopter, you better...

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.966
Where are you going,
I'm talking to you.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.123
I'm done talking to you.
I'm going back to bed.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.611
Oh, my God.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.648
Jesus, fix him.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.524
Okay.
[blows raspberry]

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.696
I tried, that's it, I tried.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.484
- I did what I could do.
- Our turn.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.210
No, no, hold on.
What're you gonna do?

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.696
You tell her,
"Baby, if you think you're grown,

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.896
you're gonna have to get your ass
out of here and go get you a job."

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.616
Don't no child supposed to be up in
your house talking to you like that.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.244
The house where you pay all the bills.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.560
What the hell is wrong with you

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.696
letting this child talk to you
like that? She got to...

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.816
[male voice]
She got to get her ass...

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.800
[normal voice]
She got to get her ass out of here.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.971
I am not putting my 17-year-old daughter
out of the house on the streets

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.929
so she can do
all kinds of criminal things.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.320
She's not gonna grow up like you.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.800
She's not gonna grow up like...

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.088
Other people have done.
I'm not doing it.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.496
What's the worst that
can happen to her?

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.251
Turn to prostitution? Drugs?
End up in the bus station,

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.816
some pimp pick her up
and put her out on the street

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.966
pimping her out for years?

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.203
Hell, how you think I met your mama?

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.045
You can't put her out?
Oh, you can't put her out?

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.281
Oh, oh, you can't.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.089
Is it too tough for you
to put her out?

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.128
You're such a nice man,
you can't put her out.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.361
I'll put her ass out.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.204
- And me, too.
- They swigging on

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.736
- testosterone and all them...
- Y'all go on, go on. Come on.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.096
Come on, y'all come on.
Let's go. Move!

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.216
Wait a minute, what are you doing,
what are you doing with my daughter?

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.971
What... Hold on. Just...
What are you gonna do

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.416
when you get up here
is what I wanna know.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.363
[indistinct shouting]

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.807
[Madea] Turn the damn lights on,
turn them on right now.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.689
Get your tail up out of that bed!

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.683
[grunts]
What the...

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.569
Go ahead! Finish your statement

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.722
so I can bust your head
to the white meat.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.776
Yeah, that's right,
she's gonna bust it to the white meat,

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.376
and I'm gonna bust it
to your damn cranium.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.600
Say what you was about to say.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.251
Let them words fall up
out of your lips, little girl.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.202
Oh, no... No, what are you
doing with my stuff?

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.523
No, no, these are not your things.
Your things is what you go in the store

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.568
and you pay for with
your hard-earned money.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.689
Your daddy bought all this stuff,
so don't none of this belong to you.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.684
This is called borrowed stuff.
Rented. Do you understand?

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.091
This don't belong to you.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.090
Oh, I like this right here!

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.089
Oh, yes, I love it!

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.447
- [Madea] You can have it.
- No, you can't, that's mine!

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.285
Oh, try to take it. Try to take it.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.091
I wanna see her do that, babe.
Please try to take it from Bam.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.766
Please try to take it from her.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.770
What is wrong with you old people?

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.136
[Madea]
Say that one more damn time.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.209
Your daddy works hard, day and night,
to buy all this stuff for you,

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.976
and you gonna sit up here
with all this attitude?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.570
- Baby, you got to go.
- Go where?

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.291
I don't know but you've got to
get the hell up out of here.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.009
- Dad.
- No, no...

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.616
He ain't gonna say nothing.
I wish he would say something.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.096
Brian, say something, so I can
bust you in the back of your damn head.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.240
Please say something to her.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.685
I like this thing right here.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.336
I can rock this
like the young people say.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.930
I can rock these.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.048
Where you going to rock it?
On your damn ankle, Bam?

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.447
Give me that damn
pair of pants, you think...

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.124
That is mine.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.486
Try and take it from me.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.891
[grunts] Dad!

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.570
[stuttering]
Uh, don't look at me.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.642
See, that is the problem.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.609
Okay, you're always
letting people run over you.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.002
You let Mom run over you,
you let her husband run over you.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.162
- You let me run over you.
- [Madea] Uh-oh.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.208
There it is. I knew she was
angry about something.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.216
Something hit that nerve.
There it is, what happened?

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.925
Your morn did not
run over me, Tiffany.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.721
Oh, so her having an affair in this
house isn't her running over you?

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.656
Brian, I believe that's
running over you, right there.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.091
I believe that's running over you.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.440
You know about that?

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.010
Of course I know about that, okay?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.128
Do you know that Morn
has no respect for you?

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.050
When are you gonna start
standing up for yourself?

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.970
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.963
I'm gonna start standing up for myself.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.320
Right now. Right now.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.164
- Pack it up.
- Yep!

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.016
- Everything. Let's pack it up.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.696
That's it, Brian.
Pack her stuff up. Pack it up!

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.449
Okay, this has to be a joke.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.966
No, I'm not joking at all.
I'm telling you right now.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.576
You obviously know everything that
went on between me and your mother,

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.776
you know everything that happened.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.856
Forgive me for trying to
protect you and your brother

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.961
from what was going on.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.736
From trying to protect you from the pain
that was happening in this house.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.526
Listen to me. It takes a stronger person
to leave a situation

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.490
than it is to stay and fight
in a situation that's not worth it.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.927
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Obviously you don't.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.446
So you clearly don't appreciate
anything that I've ever done.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.409
So it's time for you to go.
You got to go!

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.325
Go where?

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.368
I don't know.
But it's obvious you're grown.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.771
You can make your own decisions.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.536
If you cannot abide
by the rules in this house,

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.166
then you are not allowed here.
Do you understand?

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.049
Don't cry. Tiffany,
I can't do the tears.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.487
I'm not gonna do the tears.
I've had enough of this.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.607
I've had enough.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.526
Okay.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.405
I love you.
Do you understand that?

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.086
But you have to abide
by the rules in this house.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.721
If I say it, you have to abide by it.
Do you understand?

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.521
I know you're a teenager. I know that
a lot's going on. And listen to me,

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.170
I want you to go out
and live your life.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.566
I want you to make mistakes.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.016
But I don't want you
to make any mistakes

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.691
that's gonna cause you
to ruin your life.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.280
You shouldn't have gone to that party.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.368
Anything could have happened
to you over there.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.283
I'm not trying to run your life.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.681
I'm trying to protect you
as your father.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.163
And if you cannot understand that,
then you have to go. ls that clear?

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.242
- Okay.
- So tell me right now.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.005
Are you staying in this house
and abiding by my rules

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.242
or are we all gonna
put you out of here?

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.163
I'm staying. I'm listening to you.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.004
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.731
- Mean it.
- I'm sorry.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.529
I still think you need to whoop her ass.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.808
One good time.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.085
[Madea] All right. Listen.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.856
Little girl, let me explain
something to you, honey.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.451
That's what parents be trying to do.
Set you on the right path.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.285
Parents aren't perfect.
They make all kinds of mistakes.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.736
And when you start trying
to make them perfect,

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.411
you mess up thinking that they are.
They are not God.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.245
They are parents.
And they try to do the best for you.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.736
And you sitting there
and I know you're mad

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.856
at your mama for what she did

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.216
and you're mad at your daddy
for him not standing up.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.526
All that is clear, honey.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.416
But what you need to
understand about that is this.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.936
Forgive your mama, forgive your daddy,
for the things they didn't know

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.246
and you help them figure it out.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.209
Since you wanna act like you so grown.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.327
You understand?

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.285
Yes.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.840
And I'm gonna tell you right now,
I'm mad as hell at you

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.800
for letting them frat boys come up
in here and trick me up in this house.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.165
[knocking]

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.480
Uh-oh. That's the po-po.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.608
I know the po-po knock anywhere.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.569
- It probably is.
- Lord have mercy.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.642
Well, Brian. Go open the door.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.802
Yeah. Of course you want me
to get the door.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.325
I'm the only one without a warrant.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.409
- We're not done talking.
- [knocking continues]

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.606
[Hattie] Police at the door.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.844
But, Brian, I've got a prescription.
I'm still legal.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.410
Let's go see what's going on.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.569
Yeah. Who is it? Officer.
What's going on?

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.286
- We need your daughter, Tiffany.
- Tiffany? For what?

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.120
What is going on?

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.376
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.324
- You know Aday Walker?
- Yeah.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.363
When was the last time
you talked to her?

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.646
Um, last night.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.087
- She was with you at the frat house?
- Yeah.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.322
- Wait a minute, what's going on?
- Come on.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.402
No, no, no, no.
Until you tell me what's going on,

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.641
she's not going anywhere.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.846
Sir, this girl is missing.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.843
- What?
- And we need to find her.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.763
Her parents are worried sick.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.171
Go on with them.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.576
- What? Dad, no!
- Yeah, go on with them.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.762
I'm right behind you, okay? Go on.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.365
- Go on.
- Dad.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.329
[officer] Come on.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.528
You gonna put handcuffs on her?

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.489
I'm right behind you,
let me get my keys.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.726
[knocking on door]

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.280
[Jonathan]
Go home! Come back next year.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.171
Peasants, the party's over!

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.320
[officer 1]
Police! Open up!

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.129
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.456
What do they want?
What do they want?

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.323
- What do they want?
- We don't know.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.564
Dino knows. It's about that 17-year-old
charlatan from last night.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.847
You shut up, Dino.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.456
Clean up. Clean up.
Put it in the basement.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.527
[indistinct chatter]

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.726
[knocking continues]

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.682
[officer 1] Police! Open up!

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.806
[knocking continues]

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.405
[officer 1] Open up! Now!

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.403
- What's wrong with you?
- [Horse] What?

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.800
- Talk.
- [Horse] Spit it out.

01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.763
Go. Go.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.330
[man] What now?

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.562
Come on, cops again?

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.563
- [officer 1] Open up!
- [Dino] Worst party ever.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.246
Let's get out of here.
Go. Let's go, let's go, go.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.244
[knocking continues]

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.056
[officer 1] This is your
last chance to open the door.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.650
What the hell?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.526
- She disappeared last night.
- Nobody saw her?

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.967
- Dino. Dino. Dino. Dino.
- No. No. No.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.610
Dino! Dino!

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.364
- This dude was with her.
- No! Nothing.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.487
What'd you do?

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.641
<i>[door slams]</i>

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.131
[Dino] Wasn't me!

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.010
Police! We got a warrant
to search these premises.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.289
Everybody outside.
Handcuffed. Let's go.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.362
- We didn't do anything.
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.363
Everybody outside.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.410
[officer 2] Come on.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.481
Keep it moving.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.685
[officer 3] Rain Matheson,
Leah Devero. And she was here.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.001
And she's underage just like this girl.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.525
You know that.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.524
Did you bring those girls up here
and you knew they were underage?

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.284
No, no. We just invited them.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.600
But we didn't know their age.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.364
- We didn't know anything.
- Yes, you did.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.442
Both them girls
know damn well she is underage.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.807
She underage.
And you took her down to that party.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.856
That's right. That's why
you're in trouble right now.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.405
- No.
- Stop that damn lying.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.616
You've been friends with her
since y'all was in the fourth grade.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.449
How the hell you ain't know
how old she was?

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.640
- We swear. We didn't know.
- We didn't know anything.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.570
- It was them. I saw it.
- Shut up, Jonathan.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.483
We found a body in the basement.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.656
[Reverend] ls it my daughter?

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.966
[Alice] No, no, not Aday.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.965
We are waiting on the medical examiner,
but you can identify the body.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.136
See, that's what your daddy
was trying to tell you, honey.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.656
This is what I was trying
to get you to understand.

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.696
Your parents ain't lame
'cause they tell you not to go out.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.290
Not to be texting and driving.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.323
All that stuff is bad.
Y'all kill people.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.609
And now this girl is up in there dead.
She is dead. She dead.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.921
Y'all are under arrest
for the murder of Aday Walker.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.048
[all pleading indistinctly]

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.400
It was them! It was them!

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:07.165
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad, help me.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.960
Listen, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.924
- I didn't do anything.
- I will do my best to get you out.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.889
I don't know if I can, but I'll try.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.602
[male prisoner 1]
Big, strong boys.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.803
Hey, yep. Y'all finna get it. Yeah.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.211
[Jonathan crying]

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.816
[male prisoner 2]
I like the cryin' baby.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.000
[female prisoner]
Who is this?

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.849
[Jonathan continues crying]

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.091
Who cryin'?

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.606
Homie, you gonna hug
a man from the back.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.650
Nothing wrong with that though.
Good hugging in the shower.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.769
Soap flying everywhere.
So romantic.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.604
[whimpers and cries]

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.256
So you killed her
and you crying about it?

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.089
We didn't kill her. I promise.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.561
There's a dead body,
you're on the bus with us.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.130
This is messed up, bro.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.931
Hold tight. Be quiet.
And we'll be back.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.331
These are your new friends.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.096
Ain't gonna be no more
frat parties and stuff.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.408
'Cause y'all killed a girl
and you're going down for it.

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.608
Who is this?

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.768
[officer 3]
Treat her nice. She is a minor.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.808
But those two, they are 18.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.803
- Who?
- No, we're not. No, no.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.360
No, no, no. That's not us.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.330
I sure would like to
twist your hair, girl.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.136
- No, no. I don't like braids.
- [Leah] Me either.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.811
They're not a cute look.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.848
My hair doesn't twist, I swear.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.082
It's just really straight,
and, like, bendy,

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.844
and it's really not cute on me.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.576
[female prisoner]
Well, you can twist mine, baby.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.126
No, no.
Our manicures won't let us twist.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:31.000
- They'd get caught.
- I'm sorry, miss. Uh...

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.003
My name is Walter.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.765
Oh, my God, this just
keeps getting worse.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.568
Wait, wait, wait.
That's my momma and my daddy.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.680
Momma, daddy.
No, wait, wait. That's my sister.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.249
- You killed my sister!
- No, no, no. They're black.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.243
They're not even related to you!

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.730
[people screaming]

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.922
Lord have mercy.
[laughs]

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.521
Ooh!

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.409
Hey, baby. Lord have mercy.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.086
- How did I do as a cop?
- You did all right, baby,

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.216
but I don't want you to have
to run after nobody here.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.280
'Cause I don't know if you
gonna be able to keep up.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.451
You know damn well I ain't the police.
I couldn't be the police.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.409
I know. Hell, your record
longer than mine.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.136
You calling me
'cause you're getting robbed,

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.400
I might rob your ass, too.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:28.016
- I ain't the real police.
- [Madea laughs]

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.530
[screaming continues]

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.765
I want that little Jonathan to see

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.600
what it feel like
to get pranked by somebody.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.722
Since he always doing all
the damn pranking.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.961
- [growling]
- [chuckles]

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.850
They're touching me. Please!

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.730
I don't know, guys.
This is just wrong.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.296
Look, come on, now, Madea,
this is enough. Let's help them.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.004
[crying]

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.936
Maybe you better watch out
for that little one.

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.000
He look like he getting ready
to get raped for real.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.176
Go and get 'em off the bus.
He'll be all right.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.806
Go and get 'em off the bus.
But take your time.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.571
Hell, I'm enjoying this!

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.489
- [bus honking]
- [officer 3] Y'all, sit down.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.682
All the little killers, come on.
Y'all come on.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.680
Aday, come on out here, baby.
Rise from the dead.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.643
Jesus, say Lazarus, please come up.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.768
- Coming, Miss Madea.
- Thank you!

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.683
Hey, she come up from the...

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.809
Did good with that makeup, girl.
Just all bloody.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.201
Come on, keep walking.
And hurry up.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.363
Oh, no. Shh, shh. Here they come.
Here they come. Stand there like Carrie.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.926
[Jonathan crying]

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.129
[officer 3] Keep walking. Come on.
Don't say nothing. Keep walking.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.884
See, no... No hugs necessary.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.696
- [Jonathan] I love you so...
- Just keep walking.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.644
You are so wrong for that.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.087
I know. But I'm alive.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.243
I know. I'm sorry. So sorry.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.923
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Don't do that to us again.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.163
I hope you learned your lesson.
I hope all of you learned your lesson.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.562
- This is just wrong.
- Trust me, sir. We did.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.042
Well, Miss Madea, I'm sorry
we pranked you and...

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.485
You get my point for the prank?

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.562
Trust me, your prank,
we get it now. We get it.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.768
Good. Okay, good.
Thank you so much.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.730
So, how do you know
all those guys in there?

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.880
All the people came from
my neighborhood. All of 'em.

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.127
That's all my people from my hood.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.170
How did you get
all these fake officers?

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.816
Hell, Brian know
a whole bunch of people.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.056
That's how I got a fake officer.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.856
You know I don't mess
around with no real officer.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.247
Oh, no, Madea.
Those aren't fake officers.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.401
They're not fake officers.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.016
Those are real officers.
Who do you think I am?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.963
Federal prosecutor.
I brought the real officers.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.929
- Say what?
- Those aren't fake officers.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.009
- These the real police?
- Yeah.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.449
- Real po-po? One time?
- Yeah.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.883
Okay, I can handle this.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.323
Oh, shit.

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.722
Wait, so all the officers
in our house right now are real?

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.521
Now there's nothing in there you
have to be afraid of, is there, son?

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.682
We found marijuana in the house.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.809
You ain't got no prescription.
You ain't got no prescription.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.086
Hey, don't I know you?

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.804
- Let's ride.
- [shrieking]

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.176
I know I know you from somewhere!

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.361
[Barn] Madea!

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.962
- Madea!
- Hey, where you going?

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.963
[Madea]
He ain't gon' never catch me...

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.456
That's the way to get rid of them.
Come on, let's go home.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.244
- [Barn] Madea! Madea!
- I'm sorry.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.010
You are learning.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.809
[Barn]
Madea, come back and get me!

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.456
I remember I was sitting there
trying to teach you how to read.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.960
And I told you to use the
word "bishop" in a sentence.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.247
And you said,
"The bishop was at the church."

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.976
I said
"Boy, that ain't what that word means."

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.136
Then you got mad at me
because I was telling you

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.525
what the word really means.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.329
Then you say
"Daddy, use it in a sentence."

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.370
So I use it in a sentence for you.
This is what I say.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.169
"Bishop", this is what it means.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.208
"Your mama came in the house
drunk, falling down

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.930
and I had to pick the bishop."

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.447
Whoop that ass.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.041
[laughing]

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.168
- We going. Hold on here.
- [Bam] Mabel!

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.090
- [Barn groans]
- That's all right.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.816
This son of a bitch gonna
start one of these days.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.126
- Madea!
- [engine turns on]

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.525
Got any oil in there?

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.001
That's all right.
I got everything in here.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.971
Don't look like you got
no gas because we still ain't left.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.480
[chuckling]

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.810
Yo, man, wait.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.167
Remember that time.
Y'all got to stop laughing.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.641
You all over my lines.
Stop jumping my lines.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.480
Who the hell is that
up there walking for real? Now hold on.

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.045
- Hold the hell on.
- [people laughing]

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.043
Hold the hell on. Who's upstairs?

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.963
I told Kanye I could've rapped with him,

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.456
he wouldn't let me
go on the road with him.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.324
[laughing]

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.408
- You see, I'm on the canes now.
- Yes, I see it.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.369
Yeah.
[laughing]

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.202
Hell, I'm killing the cameraman.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.965
All of them got carbon
monoxide poisoning by now.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.371
Here we go.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.363
You got to go home.
After I'm done.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.016
I ain't doing all that
cuddling and holding,

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.088
acting like I like you.
I ain't finna do that.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.527
I wanna be in my bed by myself.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.364
Thank you. I'll see you later.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.681
Your 20 dollars is on the dresser.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.571
Look at...
[chuckles]

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.120
I ain't gonna tell her what happened.

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.644
[laughing]

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.761
Do you know what a ho is?
No, you don't. Be glad.

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.923
Well, you do. Well, your mama.
Your mama was a ho.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.520
But that's all right.
That's all right.

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.086
God gotta make room for everybody.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.403
Yeah, when she died I had to bury her
on her belly to give her ass a break.

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.484
'Cause she was just worn out.

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.210
But last year I was actually a ghost.

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.203
Wait, you just said
you don't celebrate ghosts.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.611
Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.964
[all laugh]

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.441
Can somebody just be on a script?

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.126
See, we've said some things twice.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.204
Yeah, I've been telling them
that she went down there to the doctor.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.489
And the doctor told her
that she can't have sex for a while.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.130
That's what the doctor told her.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.568
I said, well,
"What did the dentist say?"

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.610
[chuckling] Oh, shit.
It's too late for this shit.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.765
[continues laughing]
