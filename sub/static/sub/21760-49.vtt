TV: And now, today's
Dateline De Vil.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.210
In Topstown today--

01:16.210 --> 01:18.580
or should I say
Blow-Your-Topstown--

01:18.580 --> 01:21.750
Cruella De Vil reacted
in her usual style

01:21.750 --> 01:24.460
when fashion critic
Mr. Blackswell announced

01:24.460 --> 01:27.330
she topped this year's
worst-dressed list.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.170
Boy, you'd think
she'd at least

01:29.170 --> 01:31.670
show her good side
when she's on TV.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.120
You think Cruella
has one?

01:34.120 --> 01:36.250
Everybody has
a good side, Rolly.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.170
Hers just isn't visible
to the naked eye.

01:39.170 --> 01:43.420
TV: Tune in tomorrow
for more Cruella high jinks.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.120
I heard the news,

01:47.120 --> 01:49.120
figured you'd need
your TV fixed...

01:49.120 --> 01:50.210
again.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.880
P.H., you're the most
brilliant of the De Vils.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.040
How can I project
a good, positive me

01:56.040 --> 01:58.290
without
the accompanying nausea?

01:58.290 --> 02:01.080
A positive image,
huh?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.460
Well,
if it's an image,

02:03.460 --> 02:05.960
maybe it doesn't have
to be the real you,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.120
just a fake you.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.080
You're going
to clone me?

02:10.080 --> 02:11.710
Not exactly.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.960
A clone would be
an exact copy.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.380
I'm going to
effectively split you

02:16.380 --> 02:19.580
into your two major
personality components,

02:19.580 --> 02:24.120
a good Cruella
and an evil Cruella.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.120
Now, have a seat.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.250
And there
you have it!

02:41.250 --> 02:44.330
All the goodness has been
removed from your genes.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.420
You are now
pure evil.

02:46.420 --> 02:49.960
Funny, I don't feel
a bit different.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.830
Except that nagging
little headache is gone.

02:52.830 --> 02:56.040
P.H.: Now let's see
your better half.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.580
Where?

02:59.460 --> 03:00.750
There!

03:00.750 --> 03:03.960
Meet your good side.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.210
Isn't she rather...

03:05.210 --> 03:06.290
small?

03:06.290 --> 03:08.290
Well, I didn't have
much to work with,

03:08.290 --> 03:09.540
but not to worry.

03:15.170 --> 03:18.500
Oh, what a lovely
mad-scientist lab.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.000
Would you like me
to clean it up,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.040
get you some lunch?

03:21.040 --> 03:23.170
Make her stop!

03:23.170 --> 03:24.540
It burns!

03:24.540 --> 03:25.620
Will anyone believe

03:25.620 --> 03:29.210
this horribly accessorized
creature is me?

03:30.420 --> 03:31.750
I know.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.170
I'll unleash it
on the Dearlys.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.380
If it fools them,
it'll fool the press.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.880
Hello, Roger.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.000
Who? I mean,
uh, that's my name.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.210
Cruella, is that you?

03:48.210 --> 03:49.790
Of course it is.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.710
Where's
your lovely family?

03:51.710 --> 03:53.580
I've brought treats.

03:53.580 --> 03:56.960
Oh, there are those
adorable puppies.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
I baked enough cookies
for them, too.

04:02.290 --> 04:03.500
Don't, Rolly!

04:03.500 --> 04:06.040
It's probably
a tiny land mine.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.080
Don't worry.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.460
There's no chocolate
in them.

04:08.460 --> 04:11.790
Chocolate is bad
for dogs, you know.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.210
Oh. Hello, Cruella.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.290
Oh, no.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.960
Look what I've done.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.080
I'll have this
cleaned up in a jiffy.

04:21.080 --> 04:24.080
And, say, doesn't
that barn need painting?

04:24.080 --> 04:25.210
In fact,
this whole place

04:25.210 --> 04:27.830
could use a great big
Cruella makeover.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.250
Leave everything to me.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.670
Who was that
aproned woman?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.170
Yoo-hoo!

04:39.170 --> 04:41.040
-Eww.
-Eww.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.920
Pffbt!

04:55.170 --> 04:57.920
-Oh, my gosh!

04:57.920 --> 05:00.120
Ta-da!

05:01.250 --> 05:03.000
Now, you two lovebirds

05:03.000 --> 05:04.250
get a good night's
sleep.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.460
Is there anything
I can get you?

05:06.460 --> 05:07.500
A glass of water?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.380
-No.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.920
No.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.170
Snoozytime tea?

05:12.170 --> 05:13.210
No!

05:13.210 --> 05:16.210
She is
driving me nuts.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.290
Me, too,

05:17.290 --> 05:19.790
but she can't
keep this up forever.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.000
We just have
to be patient.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.460
Some juice?

05:23.460 --> 05:25.920
No!
Get out!

05:28.380 --> 05:30.250
I just don't get it.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.460
Why is Cruella
acting so different?

05:32.460 --> 05:34.960
And why does she
smell different?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.080
What do
you mean?

05:36.080 --> 05:39.210
Well, she used to smell
like old leather.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.710
Now she's got
that new-car smell.

05:41.710 --> 05:45.330
Hmm. Let's go see
what she's up to.

05:45.330 --> 05:48.620
Roger: She is 10 times
more obnoxious than before.

05:48.620 --> 05:49.670
I'm telling you, Anita,

05:49.670 --> 05:51.750
if she keeps up
this saint routine,

05:51.750 --> 05:53.500
we are going
to have to move.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.920
What?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.670
What a stroke
of luck!

05:57.670 --> 05:59.580
Forget improving
my public image.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.000
This is a chance
to improve

06:01.000 --> 06:02.880
my real-estate
holdings.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.040
So, that's what
she's up to.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.500
Then what's
she up to?

06:08.580 --> 06:09.920
All: Two Cruellas?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.000
What are you
doing here?

06:12.000 --> 06:12.920
Be a good clone

06:12.920 --> 06:14.330
and get back
to the Dearlys.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.790
I knew they'd
change their minds.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.000
What do they want,
milk or juice?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
They want
your company.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.290
They're just
too shy to say so.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.750
Go. Spend the night.
Spend the week.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.670
Spread some joy.

06:27.670 --> 06:30.170
And they may be
going on a trip soon,

06:30.170 --> 06:31.830
so help them pack.

06:31.830 --> 06:33.750
Oh, I will.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.670
I live to do good.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.420
Heh heh heh
ha ha ha ha ha.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.500
Finally, the Dearly
Farm is mine.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.540
And all I had to do
was be good.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.120
Ha ha ha.
Who knew?

06:46.120 --> 06:47.710
Glad I could help.

06:47.710 --> 06:50.250
I'm off to the mad
scientist's swap meet.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.170
Grr. She's gonna
take our home.

06:53.170 --> 06:55.710
This is war.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.960
We gotta send
that clone Cruella

06:57.960 --> 06:59.500
someplace else
to do good.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.420
B-But then she'll just
drive somebody else crazy.

07:05.830 --> 07:06.960
Cruella?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.790
What are you doing here
at 5:00 in the morning?

07:09.790 --> 07:11.790
I thought I'd start
by taking a donation

07:11.790 --> 07:13.790
to the local
homeless shelter.

07:13.790 --> 07:14.920
I knew
you wouldn't mind.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.330
Oh, and I'll be
borrowing the puppy bus.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.170
-Toodles.
-But-- But...

07:21.790 --> 07:24.040
Oh! A gift.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.500
How thoughtful.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.420
Oh, my company.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.790
Let's see how much
good I've done.

07:29.790 --> 07:33.040
Strip-mining,
deforestation,

07:33.040 --> 07:35.790
cheap labor in
third

07:36.830 --> 07:39.000
I can't have
my name on this.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.750
I feel soiled.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.750
I must make amends.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.880
This is our chance

07:43.880 --> 07:46.670
to right all the wrongs
done by Cruella,

07:46.670 --> 07:48.670
and stiff her
in the process.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.330
Won't this be fun?

07:50.330 --> 07:52.960
While my double
does my dirty work

07:52.960 --> 07:54.080
at the Dearlys,

07:54.080 --> 07:56.380
I'll catch
my favorite soap,

07:56.380 --> 07:58.670
The Young and
the Ruthless.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.380
At a press conference
this morning,

08:00.380 --> 08:03.210
Cruella De Vil unveiled
a whole new image.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.250
More good news.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.290
Oh, how much
can I take in one day?

08:08.290 --> 08:10.920
Starting today,
the House of De Vil

08:10.920 --> 08:13.000
will undergo
a complete transformation.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.540
I've ordered
the board of directors

08:14.540 --> 08:15.580
to give everyone

08:15.580 --> 08:17.830
raises and vacations.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.000
In addition, we'll be
replanting the rain forests,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.670
donating our profits

08:22.670 --> 08:24.170
to struggling
third-world countries,

08:24.170 --> 08:26.710
and to make up for all
the cruelty I've inflicted

08:26.710 --> 08:27.710
on the animal kingdom,

08:27.710 --> 08:30.290
I'm dedicating
my home and property

08:30.290 --> 08:32.210
as a new wildlife preserve.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.580
It's just my little way
of saying,

08:34.580 --> 08:36.420
"I'm sorry, world."

08:36.420 --> 08:37.710
Aah!

08:37.710 --> 08:39.710
(car alarm
echoing)

08:39.710 --> 08:43.750
Time to pull the plug
on that clone crone.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.500
Aah!

08:48.830 --> 08:50.830
Ahh. Wha-wha-aah-aah.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.460
Rrrr.

08:56.580 --> 08:57.880
Aah!

09:01.120 --> 09:03.120
Aren't they cute?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.880
I adopted them all.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.540
This is now the De Vil
Wildlife Refuge.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.000
I'm tearing down
the fences

09:12.000 --> 09:14.500
so they can roam free.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.290
Evil Cruella: No!

09:16.290 --> 09:17.380
Ha ha.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.880
Sounds like Cruella
has her hands full.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.000
Spot: And so do we!

09:31.380 --> 09:33.380
Funny.
I don't remember

09:33.380 --> 09:35.790
there being
a forest here.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.460
Rolly: Aah!

09:47.420 --> 09:48.710
Heh.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.080
Heh heh.

09:53.710 --> 09:56.960
Look! She tore down
the fence!

09:56.960 --> 09:59.670
Huh. I never thought
I'd say it,

09:59.670 --> 10:02.000
but I think we
better help Cruella.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.460
Yeah. Before these beasts
help themselves to us.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.330
Grutley
Animal Control?

10:08.330 --> 10:09.710
Villa De Vil
is swarming

10:09.710 --> 10:11.420
with uncontrollable
beasts.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.790
Come quick.

10:14.620 --> 10:17.250
If we can get this
Cruella in the chamber,

10:17.250 --> 10:19.080
maybe we can
unclone her.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.880
But how do we get the
other Cruella in here?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.580
How about a canine 9

10:26.170 --> 10:27.330
Come back!

10:27.330 --> 10:31.040
Your toenails will look
pretty painted pink.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.040
A wounded animal.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.250
I'm coming!

10:40.750 --> 10:43.460
Oh, you poor thing.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.620
Let me help--

10:44.620 --> 10:45.830
Oof!

10:47.420 --> 10:48.580
Let's see.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.330
"Reheat," "defrost,"
"popcorn."

10:51.330 --> 10:53.880
Ah, here it is.
"De-clone."

10:59.880 --> 11:01.080
Uhh.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.580
What happened?

11:02.580 --> 11:05.830
And why is that
nagging headache back?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.380
Spot: It worked.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.330
There's only
one Cruella.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.670
Puppies?

11:12.670 --> 11:15.330
Out, you wretched
little runts.

11:15.330 --> 11:16.500
No dogs in my--

11:16.500 --> 11:18.460
There's an uncontrollable
beast now.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.170
I'll tranquilize her.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.420
Gakk!

11:21.420 --> 11:23.880
Not me, you stuu...

11:23.880 --> 11:25.540
pid...

11:25.540 --> 11:28.460
I don't feel so...

11:28.460 --> 11:30.670
good.

11:43.580 --> 11:46.830
Anita: Roger, what's
taking you so long?

11:46.830 --> 11:49.170
Uh, I was making sure
the oven is locked

11:49.170 --> 11:50.710
and the doors are off.
Uh, I mean-- I mean...

11:50.710 --> 11:52.500
Honey, why are you

11:52.500 --> 11:54.290
carrying my sewing
machine?

11:54.290 --> 11:55.710
Oops.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.290
I guess I'm just nervous

11:57.290 --> 11:59.000
about leaving the pups
for the weekend.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.290
Get into this car,

12:00.290 --> 12:03.620
or I'll spend our
romantic weekend alone.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.750
Now, remember,

12:04.750 --> 12:06.670
we'll only be away
for the weekend.

12:06.670 --> 12:08.000
Nanny will
be gone, too,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.040
but she left plenty of food
out by the chow tower.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.620
Ohh.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.290
We're leaving
you four

12:14.290 --> 12:15.500
in charge
of the house,

12:15.500 --> 12:17.460
so I want everything
neat and clean

12:17.460 --> 12:19.290
when we return.
Understand?

12:20.620 --> 12:21.920
Did we forget
anything?

12:21.920 --> 12:23.170
Is the bathtub
running?

12:23.170 --> 12:25.500
If it is, you'd better
hurry and catch it.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.620
Huh?

12:27.620 --> 12:29.000
Very funny.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.540
-Bye.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

12:32.540 --> 12:35.500
I feel so...

12:35.500 --> 12:36.670
abandoned.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.580
What's the matter?

12:40.580 --> 12:42.790
You've been away from
your parents lots of times.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.460
Well, I always
left them.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.500
They never left me.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.830
I feel anxious
and hostile,

12:50.830 --> 12:53.330
and-- and my tail
is all poofy,

12:53.330 --> 12:55.420
and my nose is...

12:56.920 --> 12:58.420
runny!

13:00.750 --> 13:03.580
Thank you for sharing.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.920
Cadpig: Fascinating.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.750
This website
posts hundreds

13:09.750 --> 13:11.790
of pet psychological
problems.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.580
I'm sure I can find
my symptoms listed.

13:14.580 --> 13:15.960
Oh, yeah.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.460
Fascinating.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.670
Who knew there'd
be so many goldfish

13:19.670 --> 13:21.500
with fin envy?

13:21.500 --> 13:24.880
Or lovebirds in need
of marriage counseling?

13:24.880 --> 13:25.920
Or that we'd spend

13:25.920 --> 13:28.920
our one weekend without
parental supervision

13:28.920 --> 13:31.290
watching Cadpig's
nasal drip?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.540
Shh!
I found something.

13:32.540 --> 13:33.540
That's it.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.460
"Inappropriate
sadness

13:35.460 --> 13:38.460
induced by separation
anxiety..."

13:38.460 --> 13:40.750
"Growing hostility
is..."

13:40.750 --> 13:42.420
"Physical symptoms
include

13:42.420 --> 13:44.920
a bristly tail,
a..."

13:46.620 --> 13:48.120
(computer plays
blowing

13:48.120 --> 13:49.330
"Sinusitis."

13:51.580 --> 13:54.580
My worst suspicions
are confirmed.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.330
I have PDS,

13:56.330 --> 13:58.540
petting deficit
syndrome.

13:58.540 --> 14:03.460
It means I wasn't petted
enough as a puppy.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.960
What, you want a bandage
or something?

14:05.960 --> 14:07.750
There's only
one known cure.

14:07.750 --> 14:11.500
I need to be petted,
and I need it now!

14:11.500 --> 14:12.790
He'll do it.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.210
She'll do it.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.710
Mother.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.750
Uhh.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.500
The pads on my paws
are numb.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.210
Are you cured yet?

14:30.420 --> 14:32.210
Not even close.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.790
Lucky: What was that?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.920
It sounded like it
came from downstairs.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.120
I think our family's back.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.750
No, I think I hear...

14:43.750 --> 14:46.250
b-b-b-burglars!

14:47.920 --> 14:49.380
I don't hear
anything.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.040
-Whoa!
-Awk!

14:54.420 --> 14:57.290
What's going on
down there?

14:58.670 --> 15:01.170
(animals yelling
and laughing)

15:04.250 --> 15:05.460
Plehh!

15:29.620 --> 15:31.290
Howdy. Howdy.
Glad to see ya.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.540
Welcome
to my little soiree.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.750
Admission requires
a small donation.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.040
I know you'll find
any party of mine

15:39.040 --> 15:40.210
is worth the price.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.670
Spot: What happened
to the music?

15:55.670 --> 15:58.580
Lucky: Shh.
I can't tell.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.540
Well, I'll be
ding-donged.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.580
Party crashers.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.710
Sorry, puppies,

16:03.710 --> 16:05.250
but you'll have
to be a-goin'.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.540
Adios. Au revoir.

16:06.540 --> 16:07.960
So, vamoose.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.670
Listen here,
Swamp Rat.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.330
You and your cronies
have no right to be here.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.250
You're the ones who
better be leaving.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.330
Aah!

16:17.420 --> 16:18.960
Heh heh heh.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.710
Y'all don't
come back now, y'hear?

16:21.710 --> 16:24.670
(cheering and
yelling resumes)

16:26.290 --> 16:27.540
I really feel the need

16:27.540 --> 16:29.620
for a good petting right now.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.080
No time
for that.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.500
We've gotta
get help.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.290
Who's there?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.960
What in tarnation?

16:47.960 --> 16:50.420
Who did this
to you, Cyd

16:51.460 --> 16:52.500
-Aah!
-Aah!

16:52.500 --> 16:53.790
-Aah!
-Aah!

16:53.790 --> 16:56.330
This is
an unlawful assembly.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.460
Every animal will
evacuate the premises

16:58.460 --> 16:59.620
double-time!

17:01.380 --> 17:02.290
Quiet!

17:02.290 --> 17:03.420
Shh. Shh.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.540
Ah, Pug.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.080
I had a feeling you
might show up.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.790
Uh, Steven, why don't
you show the lieutenant

17:10.790 --> 17:14.380
what we think
of party poopers?

17:14.380 --> 17:15.460
Ah.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.170
An appetizer.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.960
Cadets,
fire at will!

17:25.540 --> 17:28.210
All unauthorized
personnel

17:28.210 --> 17:31.540
will withdraw from these
premises immediately!

17:31.540 --> 17:33.790
Now, hold your
horses, everybody.

17:33.790 --> 17:36.170
I've invited
a special guest

17:36.170 --> 17:38.920
just in case of
such an emergency.

17:41.380 --> 17:44.960
Somebody want me?

17:46.290 --> 17:49.290
Swamp Rat: Uh, you
remember Persian Pete,

17:49.290 --> 17:51.040
don't you, Lieutenant?

17:51.040 --> 17:54.210
I do believe you two
go way back.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.880
(teeth chattering
and mumbling)

18:04.880 --> 18:06.830
Persian Pete.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.920
Sound the retreat!

18:10.080 --> 18:11.290
Aah!

18:12.290 --> 18:13.920
Ah hah!
Whoa!

18:13.920 --> 18:15.170
Yee-gah! Ooh!

18:15.170 --> 18:16.710
Aah! Hoo!

18:19.920 --> 18:21.620
Ah-pffft!

18:23.080 --> 18:25.420
What are you weenie dogs
staring at?

18:25.420 --> 18:26.620
Scram!

18:30.420 --> 18:32.960
I don't think
anyone followed us.

18:34.290 --> 18:35.170
No.

18:35.170 --> 18:39.710
Keep biggy, baddy,
puddy-puddy cat away.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.210
What's wrong
with him?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.080
Ohh. Maybe he needs
some good petting, too.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.380
No, he doesn't.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.620
We've got a monster
cat to fight.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.500
On your feet,
Lieutenant.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.170
No!

18:54.170 --> 18:57.750
I'm comfy-womfy
here.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.710
Spot: Poor
Lieutenant Pug.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.080
Ah, what are
we gonna do?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.040
Wait a minute.
Did you notice

19:06.040 --> 19:07.500
something about
Persian Pete

19:07.500 --> 19:09.960
that seemed
familiar?

19:09.960 --> 19:12.460
You mean the weird
"pffft" noise?

19:12.460 --> 19:13.880
That frizzy tail?

19:13.880 --> 19:17.580
What? You're not
suggesting that furry oaf

19:17.580 --> 19:20.250
has the same
condition as I do?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.040
Wait a minute.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.250
The computer did say
if PDS went untreated,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.620
it would lead
to violent behavior.

19:26.620 --> 19:31.040
Ahh. Persian Pete's got
petting deficit syndrome.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.460
Pug on loudspeaker:
Attention, civilians.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.250
Persian Pete is nothing
but a greasy hairball

19:45.250 --> 19:47.790
with clumpy kitty litter
for brains.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.830
Even his mother
wouldn't lick him,

19:49.830 --> 19:54.580
and his real name
is-- gahh-- Mittens.

19:59.620 --> 20:04.040
Now, why'd you have to go
and say those things?

20:06.620 --> 20:07.670
Huh?

20:07.670 --> 20:10.580
Yoo-hoo! Over there.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.210
Phhbbt!

20:22.880 --> 20:25.880
(teeth chattering
and murmuring)

20:28.170 --> 20:31.500
You're dog meat,
Pugsy.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.790
(sighing
and purring)

20:45.120 --> 20:46.290
Heh heh.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.790
Sounds like old Pete is
putting the lieutenant

20:48.790 --> 20:50.120
through
a paper shredder.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.420
This is your third
and final warning!

20:55.420 --> 20:57.210
Evacuate the premises

20:57.210 --> 20:59.790
or face dire consequences!

20:59.790 --> 21:02.330
You tell 'em, Pugsy.

21:02.330 --> 21:06.120
Pete, I pay my goons
to break the laws,

21:06.120 --> 21:07.460
not enforce them.

21:07.460 --> 21:10.080
Oh, my goon days
are over.

21:10.080 --> 21:14.290
When I was an unknowing
sufferer of PDS,

21:14.290 --> 21:16.670
it took Pug and
his friends to show me

21:16.670 --> 21:20.460
that there's a kinder,
gentler kitty deep within me.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.670
But-- But-- But--

21:21.670 --> 21:22.880
No, no, no!

21:22.880 --> 21:24.250
Everybody out
before I forget...

21:24.250 --> 21:25.290
(snikt snikt
snikt snikt)

21:25.290 --> 21:28.710
how gentle I really am.

21:31.830 --> 21:33.790
Regroup
at the De Vil place!

21:33.790 --> 21:35.710
Cruella's
on a business trip!

21:35.710 --> 21:37.710
Let's party!

21:39.880 --> 21:41.540
Pugsy...

21:41.540 --> 21:45.120
how can I ever thank you
for showing me the light?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.420
Don't thank me.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.830
Thank my cadets.

21:47.830 --> 21:50.000
How's it going
back there?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.750
We're exhausted.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.790
Rolly: Ohh. How long do
we have to keep this up?

21:54.790 --> 21:56.500
Ahh.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.580
I have a feeling

21:57.580 --> 22:00.460
we're gonna be
doing this forever.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.500
What are you guys
complaining about?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.620
I'm the one who
needs attention.
