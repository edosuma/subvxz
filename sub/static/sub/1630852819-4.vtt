-Ever. For real.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.098
Okay.
I mean, it's your wedding,

09:27.184 --> 09:28.733
so if you want to look at more,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.101
I will show you more dresses.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.470
-Thank you.
-But I do this all day long,

09:32.606 --> 09:35.006
and sometimes you just know.

-slutty?

-I don't think slutty's
the vibe.

-No. There's literally

09:55.796 --> 09:57.662
no such thing
as too slutty at a wedding.

09:57.748 --> 09:59.497
-Danielle: Agreed.
-Okay? Because it's all virgin,

09:59.633 --> 10:02.500

that once you finally
order the dress,

13:26.923 --> 13:30.508
it will be another ten weeks,
plus three for alterations.

it's the first dress that hasn't
made me want to burst into tears

14:05.478 --> 14:08.396
when I look in the mirror,
so... That's something?

14:08.464 --> 14:09.847
No, no, no,
the bar has to be higher than

14:09.933 --> 14:11.766
"this dress didn't
make me want to cry", okay?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.634
Besides, the whole
fairy-tale wedding thing

14:13.770 --> 14:16.771

bullshit and a total cash grab.

you want to your wedding.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.212
It doesn't matter.

14:41.331 --> 14:43.881
Thank you for saying that.

ten percent of my job.

Kate:
Okay, so, you know what,

14:47.170 --> 14:50.305
I am just gonna go
change into my going-out dress.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.341
Basically spanx with an open
flap in my undercarriage.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.777

18:52.182 --> 18:54.515
Mm. Yeah, you don't really
have to lie about it. It's okay.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.634
I know they're all
really, really bad.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.053
-Yeah, they're not great.
-Like<i> 27 dresses.</i> Honestly.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.588
Yeah.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.090
Um, I just also wanted to say,

19:03.193 --> 19:04.525

19:04.611 --> 19:06.894
like, another set of eyes
or something,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.096

another place, I'm around

19:09.199 --> 19:11.199

That's a really nice offer, sam.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.373
Thank you.
Bye.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.880
-I'm around.
-No, I know. Thank you.

19:25.948 --> 19:27.415
No, of course. And, uh,

19:27.550 --> 19:30.384

another time, and if I don't,

19:30.453 --> 19:32.420
that's totally fine, too,
but, I-in the meantime,

19:32.555 --> 19:35.006

and take care of you.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.124
Yeah. I...
What?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.346
Can I have a small
black coffee, please.

were hangout friends. Nice.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.578
Uh, we weren't.
Now we are.

19:58.781 --> 19:59.997
-It's complicated.
-Okay.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.867
He's the cishet wingman
