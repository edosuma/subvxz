00:00.608 --> 00:02.662
<i>Previously, on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.663 --> 00:03.695
First place is blue team!

00:05.299 --> 00:07.033
After the men won the
special breakfast service...

00:07.034 --> 00:09.035
Mary, Jacqueline, back in line.

00:09.036 --> 00:11.938
Chef Ramsay surprised
everyone at elimination.

00:11.939 --> 00:14.273
Jeremy, give me your jacket.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.909
And even though
Jeremy was on the winning team...

00:16.910 --> 00:17.944
Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.

00:17.945 --> 00:19.712
Wow.

00:19.713 --> 00:22.115
Another bad performance
resulted in him losing his opportunity

00:22.116 --> 00:24.817
to become head chef
of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

00:24.818 --> 00:26.719
at Caesars Palace.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.920
Then, at dinner service...

00:27.921 --> 00:28.921
Let's go!

00:28.922 --> 00:29.922
Mary...
Stop!

00:29.923 --> 00:31.190
Yes, chef?
Yes, chef?

00:31.191 --> 00:32.225
Raw pork.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.227
And Nedra...

00:34.228 --> 00:35.361
There you go, Nedra.

00:35.362 --> 00:36.796
Take the tray!

00:36.797 --> 00:38.398
Crashed and
burned on the meat station.

00:38.399 --> 00:40.900
One more mistake,
and I'll kick you all out.

00:40.901 --> 00:43.136
And true to his word...

00:43.137 --> 00:47.173
You, you, you, you,
you, you, you...

00:47.174 --> 00:48.207
Get out!

00:48.208 --> 00:49.275
On the blue side...

00:49.276 --> 00:50.743
I can't work
throwing elbows at you.

00:50.744 --> 00:52.845
Ray and Dan had
problems working together...

00:52.846 --> 00:56.015
Hey, Dan, Raymond,
I have a problem.

00:56.016 --> 00:57.750
Yes, I do! !

00:57.751 --> 01:00.253
And unfortunately,
brought the whole team down with them.

01:00.254 --> 01:01.554
!
It's just raw!

01:01.555 --> 01:02.522
This can't be happening.

01:02.523 --> 01:03.990
Get out!

01:03.991 --> 01:04.956
Then, the bad
blood in the kitchen...

01:04.958 --> 01:05.992
You're a bitch.

01:05.993 --> 01:07.126
Don't call me a bitch.

01:07.127 --> 01:08.327
Spilled over into the dorm.

01:08.328 --> 01:09.662
Do something about it!

01:09.663 --> 01:11.364
At elimination,
the men nominated...

01:11.365 --> 01:12.365
Dan.

01:12.366 --> 01:14.367
And...
Ray.

01:14.368 --> 01:15.334
While the women put up...

01:15.335 --> 01:16.369
Mary.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.238
And...
Nedra.

01:19.239 --> 01:21.677
Ray, give me your jacket.

01:23.043 --> 01:25.912
Dan, give me your jacket.

01:25.913 --> 01:27.647
Nedra.

01:27.648 --> 01:29.219
Mary, give me your jacket.

01:30.184 --> 01:31.951
I've decided to do something
I've never, ever,

01:31.952 --> 01:33.886
ever done before.

01:33.887 --> 01:35.822
Find out what
chef Ramsay has in mind...

01:35.823 --> 01:36.856
I'm done.

01:36.857 --> 01:37.824
Right now...

01:37.825 --> 01:38.925
I've had enough.

a disaster,

02:55.235 --> 02:57.904
I've decided to do something
I've never, ever,

02:57.905 --> 03:01.574
ever done before.

03:01.575 --> 03:05.011
All four of you...
Are now...

03:05.012 --> 03:07.180
On probation.

03:07.181 --> 03:10.016
Go back in line.

03:10.017 --> 03:11.150
<i>Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.</i>

03:11.151 --> 03:14.020
Don't thank me yet,
and here's why.

03:14.021 --> 03:15.121
Each and every one of you

03:15.122 --> 03:17.957
will have to earn
your jacket back

03:17.958 --> 03:19.125
by the end
of the next dinner service,

03:19.126 --> 03:21.627
and if you don't,

03:21.628 --> 03:23.563
you're history.

03:23.564 --> 03:25.565
Piss off.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.437
I can't believe
we're still here.

03:31.438 --> 03:32.772
I can't believe I'm still here.

03:32.773 --> 03:36.309
I live to have another day
in Hell's Kitchen!

03:36.310 --> 03:39.145
Mary, bitch, you're a cat.

03:40.347 --> 03:41.814
You got nine lives, girl.

03:41.815 --> 03:43.316
I just want to show chef Ramsay

03:43.317 --> 03:44.984
that I deserve
to have my jacket back.

03:44.985 --> 03:46.919
I'm gonna fight
with everything I've got.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.822
We'll get our jackets back.

03:49.823 --> 03:51.891
Dan up the station.
Right.

03:51.892 --> 03:54.493
<i>I kept hearing him
whine and whine and whine.</i>

03:54.494 --> 03:56.028
I'd rather
have somebody positive

03:56.029 --> 03:58.064
than somebody negative
on the team.

03:58.065 --> 03:59.932
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
You know what?

03:59.933 --> 04:02.335
you, you.

04:03.604 --> 04:06.005
Dan, man, you need
to get over yourself, cuz.

04:06.006 --> 04:07.173
Nope.

04:08.275 --> 04:11.244

04:14.314 --> 04:15.915
You earn your coat back first.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.350
I will. Don't worry about it.
I'll have it back tomorrow.

04:17.351 --> 04:19.285
Dan, are you serious?

04:19.286 --> 04:20.519
You're not gonna get
your chef coat back

04:20.519 --> 04:22.555
acting like
a little bitch, okay?

04:22.556 --> 04:24.056
You talk all you want, man.

04:24.057 --> 04:27.393
Action. Be a man
and prove that .

End of conversation.

04:36.136 --> 04:39.805
It was the most tense
night in Hell's Kitchen so far,

04:39.806 --> 04:41.507
and this morning,
in today's challenge,

04:41.508 --> 04:44.777
all of the chefs
will be tested once again.

04:44.778 --> 04:46.178
Gettin' these jackets
back, ladies.

04:46.179 --> 04:47.513
But for the
four chefs on probation,

04:47.514 --> 04:50.583
this is their first chance
to win their jackets back.

04:50.584 --> 04:51.617
<i>Good morning.</i>

04:51.618 --> 04:53.152
Good morning, chef.

04:53.153 --> 04:55.054
<i>You can probably
guess from the decor...</i>

04:56.823 --> 04:58.157
<i>Your next challenge,</i>

04:58.158 --> 04:59.859
<i>we're gonna be working
with Chinese food.</i>

04:59.860 --> 05:02.161
I'm from the 'hood.
I like Chinese food.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.963
We got a Chinese store
every other block.

05:03.964 --> 05:05.931
Chinese store on 10th,
Chinese store on 11th,

05:05.932 --> 05:08.567
Chinese store on 21st,
30th street, 40th street,

05:08.568 --> 05:10.169
52nd street, 56th street.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.604
I know a little bit
about Chinese food.

05:11.605 --> 05:14.073
Each team will create
their version

05:14.074 --> 05:18.444
of six stunning,
traditional Chinese dishes:

05:18.445 --> 05:21.914
<i>Chow mein, spring rolls,
dumplings,</i>

05:21.915 --> 05:24.817
<i>Chinese soup,
classic fried rice,</i>

05:24.818 --> 05:27.086
<i>and finally, stir fry.</i>

05:27.087 --> 05:29.221
I lived in Asia for a year,
so I'm gonna nail it.

05:29.222 --> 05:31.490
This is my competition now.

05:31.491 --> 05:33.559
We have over 200
fortune cookies.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.662
<i>In each cookie is a name
of an ingredient.</i>

05:36.663 --> 05:39.265
<i>Two of you from each team
will be manning the boards,</i>

05:39.266 --> 05:42.301
<i>and the rest of you will be
running ingredients up to them</i>

05:42.302 --> 05:45.671
to decide which five ingredients
goes into which dish.

05:45.672 --> 05:49.175
<i>One more thing, you'll be
carrying your fortune cookies</i>

05:49.176 --> 05:53.045
to the board with...
chopsticks.

05:53.046 --> 05:55.281
Starting from...now.

06:00.354 --> 06:02.388
Oh, Susan.

06:05.192 --> 06:06.826
Back over there.
Come on.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.194
<i>Way too easy.
Come on.</i>

06:08.195 --> 06:09.428
<i>It's Hell's Kitchen, guys.</i>

06:09.429 --> 06:12.331
These cookies
don't work for me.

06:12.332 --> 06:14.200
These are the fortune cookies

06:14.201 --> 06:15.735
you'll be carrying
across the room.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.442
I can't pick up a little cookie
with chopsticks.

06:23.443 --> 06:25.678
How am I gonna pick up
a big cookie with chopsticks?

06:25.679 --> 06:28.147
Ooh, lord, help me .

06:28.148 --> 06:30.649
Red team, blue team,
I want you to decide

06:30.650 --> 06:33.052
<i>which two of you
will be manning the board.</i>

06:33.053 --> 06:34.620
<i>Let's go.
Quick. Huddle up.</i>

06:34.621 --> 06:35.888
You feel strong
in Asian cuisine?

06:35.889 --> 06:36.989
Hurry up.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.124
Who knows Asian cuisine
really well?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.525
I lived in Asia for a year.

06:39.526 --> 06:41.460
I am getting my
jacket back today.

06:41.461 --> 06:44.697
Big risks equal big rewards,
so put me on the board.

06:44.698 --> 06:47.900
Okay, ladies,
give me the names of the two

06:47.901 --> 06:50.035
<i>who are gonna arrange
the menu for you.</i>

06:50.036 --> 06:51.604
Ja'nel and Jacqueline.

06:51.605 --> 06:53.339
<i>Ja'nel and Jacqueline.</i>

06:53.340 --> 06:54.573
Jacqueline and I are definitely

06:54.574 --> 06:56.375
the most comfortable
with Asian cuisine,

06:56.376 --> 06:58.010
and we're gonna
make sure everyone knows

06:58.011 --> 06:59.478
it wasn't a bad decision.

06:59.479 --> 07:00.646
Blue team,
who's manning the board?

07:00.647 --> 07:02.047
Chef, it'll be myself and Dan.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.283
Wow. You both
haven't got jackets.

07:04.284 --> 07:06.886
Yeah, we know that, chef.
We'll be fine, chef.

07:06.887 --> 07:08.387
This is not gonna be hard.

07:08.388 --> 07:09.922
These ingredients
pick themselves.

07:09.923 --> 07:11.257
I can't this up.

07:11.258 --> 07:12.491
Everybody ready?

07:12.492 --> 07:14.660
Three minutes.
Make it count.

07:14.661 --> 07:17.263
Starting from...

07:17.264 --> 07:18.831
Now. Let's go.
Go, girls, go!

07:18.832 --> 07:20.599
For today's
challenge in Chinese cuisine,

07:20.600 --> 07:24.003
each team has three minutes
to gather five ingredients

07:24.004 --> 07:26.005
for each of their
six classic dishes.

07:26.006 --> 07:27.606
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:27.607 --> 07:29.375
The pressure is
on ja'nel and Jacqueline...

07:29.376 --> 07:30.643
I'll crack 'em.
Jackie, you pick 'em up.

07:30.644 --> 07:33.112
And Dan and Ray,

07:33.113 --> 07:35.414
to make sure the right
combination of ingredients

07:35.415 --> 07:37.583
are well-suited
for each of the dishes.

07:37.584 --> 07:38.684
<i>Got vegetables right here.</i>

07:38.685 --> 07:40.352
Bean thread or wheat noodles
for the chow mein?

07:40.353 --> 07:42.221
What do you think?
Which one? Both?

07:42.222 --> 07:43.689
Dan, he's asking
me a lot of questions.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.292
I thought you went to Asia.
Why you asking me?

07:46.293 --> 07:47.393
Where do you want squid?

07:47.394 --> 07:48.527
Squid? Squid?
Egg noodles!

07:48.528 --> 07:50.529
We need some sauces.
Can we get purple?

07:50.530 --> 07:51.597
Sauces, we need sauces.

07:51.598 --> 07:54.233
Sauces?
Purple, guys, purple.

07:54.234 --> 07:56.836
If I knew we had to run today,
I would have put on three bras

07:56.837 --> 07:58.437
to tie these bitches down.

07:58.438 --> 07:59.438
Wonton wrappers.
Ooh!

07:59.439 --> 08:01.941
Stir fry, we need what?

08:01.942 --> 08:03.142
Last minute, guys.
Let's go!

08:03.143 --> 08:04.944
Button mushrooms.

08:04.945 --> 08:06.512
We need to load this up,
the spring rolls.

08:06.513 --> 08:08.380
Do we need any more noodles?
No more noodles.

08:08.381 --> 08:10.115
I see we only have
four ingredients

08:10.116 --> 08:11.250
on some of our things, and...

08:11.251 --> 08:13.152
Corn!
I know we need five,

08:13.153 --> 08:14.854
so I'm just starting
to shout out

08:14.855 --> 08:16.922
some of these ingredients
that are laying on the table...

08:16.923 --> 08:18.724
Rice, white rice.
You got a rice?

08:18.725 --> 08:20.693
Hoping that they'll pick
something and put it up there.

08:20.694 --> 08:21.994
Wonton wrappers,
wonton wrappers.

08:21.995 --> 08:22.962
<i>Three...</i>

08:22.963 --> 08:24.396
I need, uh...
I got rice.

08:24.397 --> 08:25.364
<i>Two...
Dumplings. Dumplings?</i>

08:25.365 --> 08:26.398
Brown rice.
Chinese hot mustard.

08:26.399 --> 08:27.967
One...and stop!

08:27.968 --> 08:29.001
<i>All line up.</i>

08:29.002 --> 08:32.171
Good job, guys.

08:32.172 --> 08:34.240
They have more ingredients
on the board.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.241
<i>Ladies, you've got</i>

08:36.243 --> 08:39.378
<i>five out of six dishes
all missing ingredients.</i>

08:39.379 --> 08:40.880
Are you kidding me?

08:40.881 --> 08:42.982
Ja'nel and Jackie
totally blew it.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.117
You've got 40 minutes

08:45.118 --> 08:48.420
<i>to create six stunning dishes.</i>

08:48.421 --> 08:50.990
<i>You guys figure out
who's doing what,</i>

08:50.991 --> 08:53.592
starting from...now.
Off you go. Let's go.

08:53.593 --> 08:55.394
<i>All right, guys.
Who wants to do what?</i>

08:55.395 --> 08:56.362
Uh, I'll do soup.

08:56.363 --> 08:57.763
I want to do spring rolls.

08:57.764 --> 09:00.466
There are eight of us,
and there's only six dishes.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.535
We have to figure this out.
I don't know.

09:02.536 --> 09:04.069
Cyndi, do you think
two people on dumplings?

09:04.070 --> 09:05.404
<i>Uh, yeah. Mary.</i>

09:05.405 --> 09:06.372
<i>Yeah, dumplings?
Dumplings.</i>

09:06.373 --> 09:07.806
No starch for stir fry.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.174
<i>No rice, or anything?
Nothing.</i>

09:09.175 --> 09:11.310
We didn't put any rice up,
guys? Seriously?

09:11.311 --> 09:13.979
Jackie and Ja'nel
seriously dropped the ball.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.447
They really screwed us.

09:15.448 --> 09:18.083
I wish I had napa cabbage
on the spring rolls.

09:18.084 --> 09:19.318
<i>I put the cabbage
in the spring roll.</i>

09:19.319 --> 09:20.819
It was the last one
I put up there.

09:20.820 --> 09:21.854
We don't got none of that.

09:21.855 --> 09:23.322
If it was on the board,
it'd be here.

09:23.323 --> 09:25.257
While the ladies
find their ingredients

09:25.258 --> 09:27.092
underwhelming, the men...

09:27.093 --> 09:29.228
Whoo!
Let's go, guys, we can do it!

09:29.229 --> 09:30.896
Are overwhelmingly confident.

09:30.897 --> 09:31.997
Come on, guys, I want to win.

09:31.998 --> 09:33.032
I want to see my boys
back in the blue.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.166
Hell, yeah.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.768
But there is one exception.

09:35.769 --> 09:37.002
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.170
<i>I've never made
a chow mein, guys.</i>

09:38.171 --> 09:39.338
Basically, it's like
making a stir fry, man.

09:39.339 --> 09:40.439
You put all your noodles,

09:40.440 --> 09:41.540
and you just toss, toss, toss.
Okay.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.609
I'm looking at my ingredients,

09:43.610 --> 09:46.278
and I don't even know
what to do with this stuff.

09:46.279 --> 09:47.379
How do you cook Chinese food?

09:47.380 --> 09:50.015
Those are, uh, daikon, right?

09:50.016 --> 09:52.284
The... Is it? I've never had it,
I'm not gonna lie.

09:52.285 --> 09:53.786
Ah, yes, daikon radish,

09:53.787 --> 09:55.054
something I cook with
all the time.

09:55.055 --> 09:56.422
Ah, what the !

09:57.958 --> 09:59.725
Ooh, yeah, it's different.

09:59.726 --> 10:01.827
Just lay 'em down
on the plate, Mary.

10:01.828 --> 10:02.795
One minute to go.

10:02.796 --> 10:03.929
Yes, chef!

10:03.930 --> 10:05.998
I feel good
about working with Cyndi,

10:05.999 --> 10:07.700
but my jacket's at stake,

10:07.701 --> 10:10.469
and I really should have
taken a dish by myself.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.604
Let's go.
Start plating.

10:11.605 --> 10:12.705
Plating?
Everybody's plating?

10:12.706 --> 10:13.772
Plating!
Everybody's plating.

10:13.773 --> 10:14.974
Plating.

10:14.975 --> 10:18.010
<i>Ooh, Jess, that looks amazing.</i>

10:18.011 --> 10:19.511
<i>30 seconds to go!</i>

10:19.512 --> 10:20.746
Give me the plate.
Where's the plate?

10:20.747 --> 10:22.281
This is terrible.
This is terrible. No.

10:22.282 --> 10:25.250
It's coming down to the wire.
The blue team is a hot mess.

10:25.251 --> 10:26.385
<i>Ten seconds to go.</i>

10:26.386 --> 10:27.620
Not working.

10:27.621 --> 10:30.122
Oh, my God.
We're gonna lose again.

10:30.123 --> 10:31.657
Help me out.
Sauce, sauce, sauce.

10:31.658 --> 10:32.658
Get it on, get it on,
get it on.

10:32.659 --> 10:33.792
Four, three...

10:33.793 --> 10:35.127
Looks like .

10:35.128 --> 10:36.528
<i>This is literally...
Two...</i>

10:36.529 --> 10:37.563
Catastrophically...

10:37.564 --> 10:38.530
<i>One!</i>

10:38.531 --> 10:39.965
Terrible.
Come on.

10:39.966 --> 10:42.735
We're screwed.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.177
Today,

10:46.178 --> 10:47.445
<i>it's the first-ever
Hell's Kitchen challenge</i>

10:47.446 --> 10:48.646
in Chinese cuisine...

10:48.647 --> 10:50.114
Ten seconds to go.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.716
And after losing
four straight challenges,

10:51.717 --> 10:54.785
the men are desperate
to break their losing streak.

10:54.786 --> 10:55.786
Sauce, sauce.
Get it on, get it on, get it on.

10:55.787 --> 10:57.021
<i>Five, four...</i>

10:57.022 --> 10:58.756
However, Anthony's chow mein

10:58.757 --> 11:00.958
has the blue team
feeling a bit concerned.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.960
One, and stop!

11:04.630 --> 11:07.198
I hope all of you

11:07.199 --> 11:10.034
have created
world-class dishes,

11:10.035 --> 11:11.869
<i>because judging
your dishes tonight</i>

11:11.870 --> 11:14.906
is an award-winning chef...

Welcome. Good to see you.

Holy crap, I am about to put

11:32.424 --> 11:34.725
something that
I've never cooked before

11:34.726 --> 11:37.995
in front of chef Ramsay
and chef Yan.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.798
Battle of the fried rice,
please. Let's go.

11:40.799 --> 11:42.567
I'm getting my jacket back
right now,

11:42.568 --> 11:44.902
'cause I lived in Asia
for a year.

11:44.903 --> 11:48.372
What do you eat while you
live in Asia for a year?

11:48.373 --> 11:50.007
Asian food.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.142
Let's go. Jacqueline,
explain it to chef.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.045
Okay, we have a firm tofu

11:54.046 --> 11:56.147
with a little bit
of chili pepper, scallions,

11:56.148 --> 11:57.848
rice wine vinegar,
and bean sprouts.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.584
This is the first time
I've ever taste

11:59.585 --> 12:03.321
fried rice use rice vinegar.

12:03.322 --> 12:04.488
Mm-hmm. It works,
though, chef, doesn't it?

12:04.489 --> 12:06.657
<i>It works.
Mm-hmm.</i>

12:06.658 --> 12:08.059
Dan, let's go.
Fried rice with mushrooms.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.527
<i>I also used a little bit
of coconut milk,</i>

12:09.528 --> 12:11.896
<i>and loosely crushed peanuts,</i>

12:11.897 --> 12:13.698
<i>and some sweet and spicy
glazed prawns.</i>

12:13.699 --> 12:14.865
Presentation looks great.

12:14.866 --> 12:16.100
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

12:16.101 --> 12:19.036
The rice is
a little bit undercooked.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.539
Chinese rice should never
be undercooked.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.774
Dan, is that how
they served the rice in Asia,

12:23.775 --> 12:24.909
where you lived there
for a year?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.377
<i>Which one do you prefer?</i>

12:26.378 --> 12:28.946
I prefer the flavor,
and the imagination,

12:28.947 --> 12:31.449
and the creativity of...

12:31.450 --> 12:32.583
Red team!

12:32.584 --> 12:33.918
<i>Yes!
Yeah, Jackie!</i>

12:33.919 --> 12:36.287
Good job!
All right.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.422
Hey, Dan, go back to Asia
for another year.

12:38.423 --> 12:41.392
Uh, right, next up,
the stir fry. Let's go.

12:43.061 --> 12:44.128
<i>This is my stir fry here.</i>

12:44.129 --> 12:45.896
Wheat noodles,
there are sea scallops,

12:45.897 --> 12:48.332
also a little
mirin soy sesame oil.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.601
It's very difficult
not to overcook this,

12:50.602 --> 12:53.337
so you overcook this,
you ruin it.

12:57.075 --> 12:59.610
Means "amazing."
Not overcooked.

12:59.611 --> 13:00.945
Good.
It's very good.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.313
<i>Very good.
Thank you, chef, thank you, chef.</i>

13:02.314 --> 13:04.649
<i>Well done, Jon.
Good job.</i>

13:04.650 --> 13:06.784
<i>My dish is more
of an appetizer dish.</i>

13:06.785 --> 13:09.220
<i>I mean, it looks
a very weird stir fry.</i>

13:09.221 --> 13:10.521
This is supposed to be
a stir fry,

13:10.522 --> 13:12.289
but you serve it differently.

13:12.290 --> 13:13.958
I didn't have
a lot of components

13:13.959 --> 13:15.159
<i>to work with, so...</i>

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
I don't want you
to make an excuse

13:16.161 --> 13:17.261
in front of the chef, please.

13:17.262 --> 13:18.429
He's given up his day
to be here.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.231
Jessica,
what is wrong with you?

13:20.232 --> 13:22.033
Take responsibility for that.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.067
Which one do you prefer?

13:23.068 --> 13:25.302
I will give...
The blue team!

13:25.303 --> 13:27.838
<i>Blue team, good.</i>

13:27.839 --> 13:29.306
All right, we got a point.

13:29.307 --> 13:31.142
A point is a point is a point.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.678
Okay, next up.
Spring roll, please. Let's go.

13:33.679 --> 13:34.945
With the score tied,

13:34.946 --> 13:36.747
Barret's zesty
lime spring roll...

13:36.748 --> 13:38.683
Very imaginative.
Very, very nice.

13:38.684 --> 13:42.253
Goes head-to-head with
Nedra's peanut sriracha spring roll.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.022
<i>This is more a
vietnamese-style spring roll.</i>

13:45.023 --> 13:46.924
I give, blue team!

13:46.925 --> 13:48.693
Thank you, chef.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.095
With the men leading,
Ray's crab dumpling...

13:51.096 --> 13:53.631
I like the shape, because
this is how you knead it.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.466
<i>Yeah.
And it takes skill.</i>

13:55.467 --> 13:58.736
Is up against
cyndi's honey soy dumpling...

13:58.737 --> 14:00.938
Sweet and sour and spicy.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.440
And although
both dishes impress...

14:02.441 --> 14:04.308
The red team!

14:05.777 --> 14:08.746
Cyndi gets the
point, evening the score.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.214
The battle of the soup.
Let's go.

14:10.215 --> 14:12.983
Ja'nel's
lemongrass red miso soup...

14:12.984 --> 14:15.853
Incorporation of lemongrass
actually give it a little kick.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.188
Packs a punch...

14:17.189 --> 14:18.756
Very nice.

14:18.757 --> 14:21.125
While Michael's
sweet and sour Halibut soup...

14:21.126 --> 14:23.294
I like the overall
presentation.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.729
Does not disappoint.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.630
Two good soups.
Which one do you prefer?

14:26.631 --> 14:29.500
I...

14:29.501 --> 14:32.470
look at this as a draw.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.472
One point and one point.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.342
It all comes down
to the chow mein.

14:38.343 --> 14:39.677
Let's go, Suzie.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.378
<i>Come on, Suzie.
Bring it home, Suzie, 5-0.</i>

14:41.379 --> 14:42.646
<i>Let's go.</i>

14:42.647 --> 14:44.682
Susan, explain your chow mein
to the chef, please.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.717
Yes, chef. I have...
Rice noodle.

14:46.718 --> 14:50.187
A rice noodle with pork
that I did a quick marinade on,

14:50.188 --> 14:51.856
<i>and I threw in
some crushed cashews.</i>

14:51.857 --> 14:53.357
<i>I like the flavor.</i>

14:53.358 --> 14:54.692
The bean sprouts
give it a really nice,

14:54.693 --> 14:56.127
wonderful texture,

14:56.128 --> 14:59.296
but I prefer to have a
little bit more color contrast.

14:59.297 --> 15:02.600
Green onion would
really, really perk it up.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.069
Okay, Anthony,
please, let's go.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.372
<i>Chefs, I made a very simple
wheat and rice noodle chow mein</i>

15:08.373 --> 15:09.907
<i>with daikon radish,</i>

15:09.908 --> 15:11.475
<i>and it's topped
with candied ginger.</i>

15:11.476 --> 15:13.811
Very interesting combination.

15:15.647 --> 15:18.149
I like the texture contrast,

15:18.150 --> 15:21.051
<i>and this is a very good
chow mein dish.</i>

15:21.052 --> 15:23.821
Oh, my God.
He is complimenting my dish.

15:23.822 --> 15:24.922
<i>We're tied right now,</i>

15:24.923 --> 15:27.424
and it's all down
to the chow mein.

15:27.425 --> 15:29.860
Please say blue team wins.
Come on, blue team, blue team.

15:29.861 --> 15:32.429
Tough one now,
because your decision

15:32.430 --> 15:34.632
is gonna decide
which team wins.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.834
I'm not worried.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.435
I definitely think we have
this one in the bag.

15:38.436 --> 15:43.040
I hope chef Gordon
also agree with me.

15:43.041 --> 15:46.811
<i>I will give this...</i>

15:46.812 --> 15:47.778
The blue team!

15:47.779 --> 15:48.846
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

15:48.847 --> 15:50.080
Thank you, chef.
Yahtzee, baby!

15:50.081 --> 15:52.983
That's awesome!

15:52.984 --> 15:55.052
Ah, yeah.
That's the way, Uncle Ray.

15:55.053 --> 15:58.155
We finally won a challenge.

15:58.156 --> 15:59.857
Thank you, lord.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.125
Thank you, chef!
Thank you, chef!

16:01.126 --> 16:02.793
<i>Thank you, chef!
Well done. Pleasure.</i>

16:02.794 --> 16:06.030
Dan and Ray, I'm gonna give
both of you your jackets back.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.264
Yes!

16:08.233 --> 16:09.333
Give my boys their jackets.

16:09.334 --> 16:11.802
Good job.
Dan, welcome back.

16:11.803 --> 16:13.103
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

16:13.104 --> 16:16.307
Mwah! Ah, you're mine.
You're staying with me.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.708
Stay right here, baby.
Ha ha!

16:17.709 --> 16:19.176
<i>Blue team,</i>

16:19.177 --> 16:23.414
I have the most amazing way
for all of you to unwind today.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.682
We need it, chef.

16:24.683 --> 16:25.816
It's a surprise, okay?

16:25.817 --> 16:27.318
That's fine.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.652
So head upstairs
and get changed.

16:28.653 --> 16:29.687
Whoo!

16:29.688 --> 16:30.721
Finally.

16:30.722 --> 16:31.956
<i>Wow.</i>

16:31.957 --> 16:34.458
It's about time,
and the best part is...

16:34.459 --> 16:37.094
Look what I got.
Hee hee hee!

16:37.095 --> 16:41.632
Ladies, you have a humongous
amount of preparation

16:41.633 --> 16:43.067
<i>ahead of tonight's
dinner service,</i>

16:43.068 --> 16:47.171
and one of our highlights
will be the beef pot stickers

16:47.172 --> 16:48.973
and steamed dumplings.

16:48.974 --> 16:53.110
<i>These items require
great attention to detail,</i>

16:53.111 --> 16:54.778
so focus.
Out you go.

16:54.779 --> 16:55.980
Yes, chef.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.581
<i>I'm on my last legs here.</i>

16:57.582 --> 16:59.250
If I don't earn my jacket back,

16:59.251 --> 17:00.851
I don't live to see
another day.

17:00.852 --> 17:02.353
So freakin' scary.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.855
Did we find a broom yet, or no?

17:04.856 --> 17:06.490
Our kitchen was a lot cleaner.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.157
<i>Who knows how to make
the beurre monte?</i>

17:08.159 --> 17:09.159
I do.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.461
We need it for both kitchens.

17:11.762 --> 17:12.829
Oh, here they come.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.300
What goes around comes around,
bitches.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.502
All right, all right,
all right.

17:18.502 --> 17:19.737
What up, ladies?

17:19.738 --> 17:21.605
Have fun.
We'll bring you something nice.

17:21.606 --> 17:22.573
How 'bout that, yeah?

17:22.574 --> 17:24.575
Take that, skanks.

17:27.244 --> 17:29.914
Whatever the reward is,
bring it on, man.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.715
I just need the sun on my face.

17:31.716 --> 17:34.752
This is awesome, yeah?

17:34.753 --> 17:37.521
We're paintballing, bitches,
and the object: Kill Dan.

17:43.628 --> 17:46.563
I'm hunting Dan.
Bring it on. Pah!

17:49.367 --> 17:50.734
Boom! Boom! Boom, boom!

17:55.040 --> 17:56.006
Ah, stop!
Pah, pah, pah!

17:56.007 --> 17:57.508
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

17:59.010 --> 18:00.577
Bye-bye.

18:00.578 --> 18:01.779
<i>That's game!</i>

18:02.781 --> 18:04.148
It was fun shooting Dan.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.250
So therapeutic.
I loved it.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.888
While the blue team enjoys
getting physical out in the sun,

18:10.889 --> 18:11.922
back at Hell's Kitchen...

18:11.923 --> 18:13.657
My back hurts.

18:13.658 --> 18:16.193
The red team is not
enjoying the tedious physical labor.

18:16.194 --> 18:18.362
This is delicate work.

18:18.363 --> 18:22.433
To make these little dumplings
is so tedious.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.502
Hunched over, one after another,
after another.

18:25.503 --> 18:27.871
I don't like punishment,
not one damn bit.

18:27.872 --> 18:29.206
<i>What that...</i>

18:29.207 --> 18:30.808
I'm hungry, though,
that's fo' sho'.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.609
Yeah, right?

18:32.610 --> 18:34.478
I ain't down
for this punishment stuff.

18:34.479 --> 18:36.113
Let's hurry up
and finish prepping

18:36.114 --> 18:38.749
so a bitch can go
get a snack or somethin'.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.551
Chef Ramsay has prepared

18:40.552 --> 18:42.019
something really special
for you guys.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.388
Balut eggs.

18:44.389 --> 18:45.823
Oh, man.
Oh!

18:45.824 --> 18:50.160
We have a balut egg, which is
a baby chicken in an egg.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.263
<i>Eat up.</i>

18:53.264 --> 18:54.631
<i>You gotta eat 'em fast, guys.</i>

18:54.632 --> 18:56.500
I'm not puttin' that
in my mouth, I'm sorry.

18:56.501 --> 18:59.470
The first one I cracked open
had a little baby chicken:

18:59.471 --> 19:03.507
Bill and feet, eyes, wings,
feathers, everything.

19:03.508 --> 19:04.541
We have to eat all of them?

19:04.542 --> 19:05.576
<i>I'm gonna say yes.</i>

19:05.577 --> 19:08.278
We have so much work
ahead of us.

19:08.279 --> 19:10.981
The faster we get this done,
the faster we can move on.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.916
It's best if we can all
just suck it up

19:12.917 --> 19:14.318
and just push through.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.819
Oh, I can't do it
if I make eye contact.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.221
Is the eyeball big?

19:21.159 --> 19:22.326
<i>We have to eat it.</i>

19:22.327 --> 19:24.495
<i>I'm not eating this.
This is nasty!</i>

19:27.678 --> 19:29.212
The red team has experienced

19:29.213 --> 19:30.847
their first challenge loss...

19:30.848 --> 19:31.881
<i>Don't vomit, 'cause
it'll start a chain reaction.</i>

19:33.551 --> 19:35.685
And are now getting
their first taste of failure.

19:35.686 --> 19:37.387
I'm gonna throw up.

19:37.388 --> 19:39.856
<i>Come on, guys, you have
a busy day today. Let's go.</i>

19:41.225 --> 19:42.726
<i>Hold it back.
Hold it back.</i>

19:44.428 --> 19:45.428
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

19:46.631 --> 19:48.732
I would've rather
have eaten raw chicken

19:48.733 --> 19:50.767
than what I just ate today.

19:50.768 --> 19:51.801
<i>Girls, let's go.</i>

19:51.802 --> 19:53.803
Yes, chef.

19:54.905 --> 19:56.840
I seriously feel like puking.

19:56.841 --> 19:58.241
<i>I do too.</i>

19:58.242 --> 19:59.909
<i>Make sure we have everything.
If we don't...</i>

19:59.910 --> 20:01.578
what about the men's side,
who's doing that?

20:01.579 --> 20:04.147
Blue. Blue. Blue.

20:04.148 --> 20:05.782
Blue. Blue.
Yeah.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.617
Hey, how's my
little dumplings doing?

20:07.618 --> 20:09.219
Whatever happened
out in the field,

20:09.220 --> 20:10.420
we'll leave in the field.

20:10.421 --> 20:11.788
It's time to get back
in the kitchen now

20:11.789 --> 20:13.189
and knock out
this dinner service.

20:13.190 --> 20:15.025
Now, we're gonna start
taking the red out one by one.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.030
Honestly, I feel

20:20.031 --> 20:22.532
that you are ready

20:22.533 --> 20:24.934
<i>for a bloody good
dinner service.</i>

20:24.935 --> 20:26.236
Yes, chef.

20:26.237 --> 20:29.873
So we are launching
our chef's tables tonight.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.275
<i>In the blue kitchen,</i>

20:32.276 --> 20:33.943
<i>you'll be taking care
of a very funny actor.</i>

20:33.944 --> 20:36.613
<i>He was associated
with the hit series Entourage</i>

20:36.614 --> 20:38.214
as Ari's assistant.

20:38.215 --> 20:40.350
Rex Lee
is gracing the chef's table

20:40.351 --> 20:42.319
in the blue kitchen
the evening.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.921
Rex Lee, this is
the creme de la creme,

20:44.922 --> 20:46.723
and we gotta make sure
this is right.

20:46.724 --> 20:51.328
Ladies, you'll be cooking
for a Hollywood heavy-hitter,

20:51.329 --> 20:56.333
<i>directed the Wedding Planner,
Hairspray, Rock of Ages.</i>

20:56.334 --> 21:00.537
Mr. Adam Shankman and his guests
will be gracing your table

21:00.538 --> 21:02.005
in the red kitchen
tonight, okay?

21:02.006 --> 21:03.940
Yes, chef.
Good.

21:03.941 --> 21:05.508
Mary, are you ready
for your jacket?

21:05.509 --> 21:06.509
Yes, chef.

21:06.510 --> 21:07.477
Nedra, are you ready
for your jacket?

21:07.478 --> 21:08.745
Yes, chef.

21:08.746 --> 21:10.246
Well, you saw what happened
to the blue team.

21:10.247 --> 21:12.148
<i>Prove you're worthy,
you've got it immediately.</i>

21:12.149 --> 21:14.017
Okay, let's go, guys.

21:14.018 --> 21:15.819
Jean-Philippe,
open Hell's Kitchen, please.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.387
<i>Let's go.</i>

21:23.394 --> 21:25.562
Good evening, welcome.

21:25.563 --> 21:26.696
Let's do this, ladies.

21:26.697 --> 21:27.831
No one's going home
tonight, right?

21:27.832 --> 21:31.468
Shine as individuals,
work as a team, yes?

21:31.469 --> 21:32.435
You guys ready?

21:32.436 --> 21:34.003
Oh, yeah.

21:34.004 --> 21:35.939
In addition
to his classic menu...

21:35.940 --> 21:37.374
The cauliflower risotto.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.175
Sourdough-crusted halibut.

21:39.176 --> 21:42.545
Tonight, chef Ramsay has
added a tableside dim sum cart,

21:42.546 --> 21:43.847
which will be looked after

21:43.848 --> 21:45.582
by Ja'nel on the red side
of the dining room,

21:45.583 --> 21:47.283
and Ray on the blue side.

21:47.284 --> 21:48.918
<i>Okay, ladies, here we go.</i>

21:48.919 --> 21:49.919
<i>Good luck.
Yes, chef.</i>

21:49.920 --> 21:51.121
Four covers, table 34.

21:51.122 --> 21:52.155
One dim sum, one risotto,
two scallops.

21:52.156 --> 21:53.123
Yes, chef.

21:53.124 --> 21:54.557
You have one risotto.

21:54.558 --> 21:55.959
Gonna rock out
and get my jacket back.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.861
I need a little
chicken stock, excuse me.

21:57.862 --> 21:59.629
You know, the jacket
is protective.

21:59.630 --> 22:02.365
It protect your arms,
your hoo-has.

22:02.366 --> 22:03.700
You ready
with the first risotto?

22:03.701 --> 22:05.869
Walking!
Walking with the lobster.

22:05.870 --> 22:08.004
We need
our jackets back.

22:08.005 --> 22:09.572
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

22:09.573 --> 22:12.075
Right behind you
with the first risotto, chef.

22:13.611 --> 22:14.611
<i>Nedra!</i>

22:14.612 --> 22:15.678
Yes, chef?

22:15.679 --> 22:17.447
Come here!

22:17.448 --> 22:18.948
Oh, my gosh.
Here we go.

22:18.949 --> 22:22.352
We cannot
screw this up tonight.

22:22.353 --> 22:23.953
Risotto, delicious.

22:23.954 --> 22:26.089
Really delicious.
Off you go, jacket on.

22:26.090 --> 22:27.490
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

22:27.491 --> 22:28.691
Whoo!

22:28.692 --> 22:32.462
I got my jacket on.
Tha... thank you.

22:32.463 --> 22:35.265
Mary and Nedra's
performance on the appetizers

22:35.266 --> 22:37.367
has gotten the team
off to a great start,

22:37.368 --> 22:39.803
and gotten Nedra
her jacket back.

22:39.804 --> 22:41.538
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

22:41.539 --> 22:43.306
Two scallops, one dim sum,
one cappellini.

22:43.307 --> 22:44.340
Run with the capp.
Right here, right here.

22:44.341 --> 22:45.675
Ready to go.
Walking with it!

22:45.676 --> 22:47.377
Jon and
Anthony are in total sync

22:47.378 --> 22:48.411
on their appetizers...

22:48.412 --> 22:49.846
<i>Very nice.</i>

22:49.847 --> 22:51.314
And have earned
chef Ramsay's praise.

22:51.315 --> 22:52.749
Service, please.

22:52.750 --> 22:56.519
But in the dining
room, Ray is way behind.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.754
<i>So sorry.
Ray is gonna come</i>

22:57.755 --> 22:59.155
and do your dim sum as well.

22:59.156 --> 23:00.290
Yeah.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.758
And appetizers from the kitchen

23:01.759 --> 23:04.260
are hitting the tables
ahead of Ray's dim sum.

23:04.261 --> 23:06.196
J.P., he needs to speed up
a little bit.

23:06.197 --> 23:07.997
Hi, ladies.

23:07.998 --> 23:10.633
The guys are abso-
killing me over here, seriously.

23:10.634 --> 23:11.868
I'll take this back.

23:11.869 --> 23:13.603
They need to slow down,
because I'm by myself.

23:13.604 --> 23:16.005
I need another risotto
because this is cold now, chef,

23:16.006 --> 23:19.442
because I was too slow...
Oh, off, Ray.

23:19.443 --> 23:20.743
Fire one risotto, urgently!

23:20.744 --> 23:22.412
Yes, got a risotto going, chef.
Pushing the risotto.

23:22.413 --> 23:23.913
While the blue team backtracks

23:23.914 --> 23:25.882
to re-fire
the table of appetizers...

23:25.883 --> 23:27.317
Let's just get it going, guys.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.985
Chef Ramsay
isn't slowing down...

23:28.986 --> 23:30.019
Two risotto, one cappellini,
one dim sum.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.020
Two minutes, chef.

23:31.021 --> 23:32.589
Come on, then.
Coming up.

23:32.590 --> 23:34.123
And if there wasn't
enough pressure already,

23:34.124 --> 23:36.659
the VIP guests for
the chef's table have arrived...

23:36.660 --> 23:37.660
Watch your step.

23:37.661 --> 23:39.128
In both the blue...

23:39.129 --> 23:40.396
Welcome, welcome.
Sit back and enjoy.

23:40.397 --> 23:41.431
Thank you so much, chef.

23:41.432 --> 23:42.832
And the red kitchens.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.034
I'm Cyndi, I'll be
serving you this evening.

23:45.035 --> 23:46.102
For your appetizer?

23:46.103 --> 23:47.303
I'll do the Caesar
with prawns, please.

23:47.304 --> 23:48.271
Yes, sir.

23:48.272 --> 23:49.305
Mary?
Appetizers!

23:49.306 --> 23:50.306
<i>Yes, chef?
Two risotto,</i>

23:50.307 --> 23:51.274
<i>one burrata, one dim sum.</i>

23:51.275 --> 23:52.442
Yes, chef!

23:52.443 --> 23:53.877
I'm feeling really nervous
right now.

23:53.878 --> 23:57.180
Nedra got her jacket back,
and I'm running out of time.

23:57.181 --> 23:58.281
I'm gonna cook to save my life.

23:58.282 --> 23:59.749
Come on, Mary, please.

24:01.318 --> 24:02.652
Here's the risotto, chef.

24:05.422 --> 24:06.623
Mary?
Yes, chef?

24:06.624 --> 24:08.892
Come here.
Yes, chef.

24:08.893 --> 24:09.959
Risotto delicious.
Get your jacket on.

24:09.960 --> 24:10.994
Thank you, chef!

24:10.995 --> 24:12.028
Uh, madam,

24:12.029 --> 24:13.062
now that you've got it,
keep hold of it.

24:13.063 --> 24:14.063
Yes, chef.

24:14.064 --> 24:15.331
Yes!

24:15.332 --> 24:16.533
Good job, Mary.

24:16.534 --> 24:18.067
Yes, chef.
Go.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.702
With the exception
of the chef's table,

24:19.703 --> 24:23.039
Mary, Nedra, and Ja'nel have
served all of the appetizers.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.507
Please enjoy.
Thank you.

24:24.508 --> 24:26.409
Come on, you guys, let's go!

24:26.410 --> 24:29.479
Me and Mary, we've been
kicking ass and taking names.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.480
<i>Now, we just gotta keep moving.</i>

24:30.481 --> 24:31.781
<i>Away next...</i>

24:31.782 --> 24:34.150
These bitches
bet' not it up.

24:34.151 --> 24:36.486
Entree, one cod, one halibut,
two chicken, two Wellington.

24:36.487 --> 24:37.887
<i>Yes, chef. Let's go.</i>

24:37.888 --> 24:41.024
Now,
it's up to Susan on meat...

24:41.025 --> 24:42.559
And Jessica on fish...

24:42.560 --> 24:43.726
One halibut, right?

24:43.727 --> 24:45.194
To keep everything on track.

24:45.195 --> 24:47.463
Susan, how long on two chicken?

24:47.464 --> 24:49.532
The... it's... that...
We need time.

24:49.533 --> 24:52.402
Susan is a mess.
I'm worried.

24:52.403 --> 24:55.038
How long?

24:55.039 --> 24:57.807
What am I supposed to do?
I have two fish on that order.

24:57.808 --> 25:00.076
What do I have in there?
Oh, let me check my chicken.

25:00.077 --> 25:03.112
She needs to snap out of it,
get her head out of her .

25:03.113 --> 25:05.148
I need to get
this chicken right.

25:06.517 --> 25:08.284
While Susan
checks her chicken...

25:08.285 --> 25:09.619
You ready?
Yeah.

25:09.620 --> 25:10.720
Just keep moving.

25:10.721 --> 25:11.955
Over in the blue kitchen...

25:11.956 --> 25:13.323
Right here, right here.
Walking. Let's go.

25:13.324 --> 25:14.457
The men have
rebounded on appetizers.

25:14.458 --> 25:15.959
Very nice.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.560
All right, guys, let's just
keep it calm. We're doing fine.

25:17.561 --> 25:18.995
<i>Serve the chef's table, please.</i>

25:18.996 --> 25:19.996
<i>Let's go.</i>

25:19.997 --> 25:21.864
There's your cappellini.

25:21.865 --> 25:22.999
I'm serving the VIP table.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.534
Want you guys to enjoy it.

25:24.535 --> 25:26.636
He's important to chef Ramsay,
so he's important to me,

25:26.637 --> 25:28.871
so I'ma give him
the best service possible,

25:28.872 --> 25:30.974
and I'ma do it with a smile.

25:30.975 --> 25:32.275
<i>Okay, blue team.</i>

25:32.276 --> 25:33.309
Blue team!
On order:

25:33.310 --> 25:34.911
<i>Chef, chef?
Two covers away.</i>

25:34.912 --> 25:35.945
<i>Chef's table, yes? Vvip.</i>

25:35.946 --> 25:36.946
<i>One halibut, one cod.</i>

25:36.947 --> 25:38.014
Yes, chef.

25:38.015 --> 25:39.115
I got it.

25:39.116 --> 25:40.116
I feel great
that I'm being assigned

25:40.117 --> 25:41.284
the fish station,

25:41.285 --> 25:43.353
because I've cooked fish
thousands of times.

25:43.354 --> 25:47.090
VIP table's a fish table,
so don't us.

25:47.091 --> 25:49.392
Dan is just, um, an .

25:49.393 --> 25:51.194
How long? You ready?

25:51.195 --> 25:54.197
How long you need?
How long do you need, Barret?

25:54.198 --> 25:56.232
Shut the up
and let me cook.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.400
I'm ready.

25:57.401 --> 25:58.868
<i>One cod, one halibut.</i>

25:58.869 --> 26:01.237
I'll take your halibut sauce.
Behind you, chef.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.375
Raw shrimp.

26:05.376 --> 26:07.810
Hey, guys.
Hey, all of you, come here!

26:07.811 --> 26:09.445
A table sat in the kitchen

26:09.446 --> 26:12.215
<i>and a raw shrimp.</i>

26:12.216 --> 26:13.716
Stone cold.

26:13.717 --> 26:16.285
I guess you're not as good
as you think you are, Barret.

26:16.286 --> 26:17.353
Barret!
Yes, chef?

26:17.354 --> 26:18.821
<i>How dare you!</i>

26:18.822 --> 26:20.990
While Barret
has messed up the entrees

26:20.991 --> 26:22.925
for the VIP chef's table
in the blue kitchen...

26:22.926 --> 26:25.028
Food looks good.
It's just not coming our way.

26:25.029 --> 26:27.597
Chef Ramsay is looking
for some better execution

26:27.598 --> 26:28.631
from the red team.

26:28.632 --> 26:29.599
Where's the ticket?

26:29.600 --> 26:30.833
I'm ready with chicken!

26:30.834 --> 26:31.901
Go ahead, I'm ready.

26:31.902 --> 26:33.703
Coming, chef.

26:33.704 --> 26:36.072
Chicken.
Service, please.

26:36.073 --> 26:37.373
<i>Next table!</i>

26:37.374 --> 26:38.441
On order, three covers.
Chef's table, yes?

26:38.442 --> 26:39.442
Yes, chef.

26:39.443 --> 26:40.710
One halibut, one cod, one lamb.

26:40.711 --> 26:41.711
Lamb requested medium.

26:41.712 --> 26:42.712
Yes, chef.

26:42.713 --> 26:44.180
<i>Let's go, Susan.
Yes, chef.</i>

26:44.181 --> 26:46.149
That lamb's gotta be perfect.

26:46.150 --> 26:48.785
Chef Ramsay obviously
feels confident.

26:48.786 --> 26:50.953
That's why he's put me
on the meat station by myself.

26:50.954 --> 26:52.889
<i>I need to make sure
this lamb is medium.</i>

26:52.890 --> 26:54.524
Do we even have the cod
in the pan?

26:54.525 --> 26:55.491
Yes.
Yes, cod is in the pan,

26:55.492 --> 26:56.526
in the oven.

26:56.527 --> 26:57.760
I feel ahead of the game.

26:57.761 --> 27:00.029
Can I slice?
You can slice.

27:00.030 --> 27:00.997
Everything's on point.

27:00.998 --> 27:02.832
!
This lamb!

27:02.833 --> 27:04.267
This is really raw.

27:04.268 --> 27:06.169
These lambs
are a son of a bitch.

27:06.170 --> 27:08.871
They just take forever to cook.

27:08.872 --> 27:10.273
Walking cod and halibut.

27:10.274 --> 27:11.274
Yeah, really?

27:11.275 --> 27:13.309
I need some time
on my lamb, guys!

27:13.310 --> 27:15.144
How long for the chef's table?

27:15.145 --> 27:16.512
<i>Chef, we're dragging
on the lamb.</i>

27:16.513 --> 27:17.647
Just hurry up, Susan!

27:17.648 --> 27:19.916
<i>Drive the table!
Got it, chef.</i>

27:19.917 --> 27:21.684
This is a VIP table.

27:21.685 --> 27:23.586
I have everybody yelling at me
for this lamb to be done,

27:23.587 --> 27:26.522
but I can't make the oven
cook it any faster.

27:26.523 --> 27:28.424
<i>Susan, come on!</i>

27:29.960 --> 27:31.160
How long, Susan?

27:31.161 --> 27:32.695
Coming, chef.

27:34.031 --> 27:35.398
!

27:35.399 --> 27:36.799
Oh, .

27:36.800 --> 27:39.102
I just dropped my lamb, guys.

27:39.103 --> 27:40.503
<i>Oh, for sake.</i>

27:46.788 --> 27:49.156
It's 90 minutes
into dinner service...

27:49.157 --> 27:50.858
How long, Susan?

27:50.859 --> 27:53.027
And all that's needed
to complete the entree order

27:53.028 --> 27:54.595
on the chef's table is lamb.

27:54.596 --> 27:55.596
Coming, chef.

27:55.597 --> 27:57.097
But thanks to Susan...

27:58.567 --> 28:00.000
Oh, no.

28:00.001 --> 28:01.135
They won't be getting fed...

28:01.136 --> 28:02.136
!

28:02.137 --> 28:03.571
Any time soon.

28:03.572 --> 28:05.940
I just dropped the lamb.
Oh.

28:05.941 --> 28:07.241
<i>Is that the lamb medium?</i>

28:07.242 --> 28:08.209
Yes, chef.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.778
Oh, my God.

28:10.779 --> 28:13.447
I can't believe you dropped
the damn lamb for the VIP table!

28:13.448 --> 28:14.815
Bitch, you better

28:14.816 --> 28:16.784
get your together
quick, homegirl.

28:16.785 --> 28:18.152
How long on that lamb?

28:18.153 --> 28:19.520
Still need five minutes.

28:19.521 --> 28:22.189
Five minutes out
on the chef's table.

28:22.190 --> 28:26.727
I am highly aware that
they screwed up our order.

28:28.096 --> 28:30.130
It's gonna be eight minutes.
It's raw.

28:30.131 --> 28:33.968
The meat and the fish station
have to work cohesively.

28:33.969 --> 28:36.637
It's just becoming chaos.

28:36.638 --> 28:37.805
Susan, how much longer

28:37.806 --> 28:38.772
on the medium lamb?

28:38.773 --> 28:39.874
Four minutes.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.642
Is Susan gonna be ready
in four minutes?

28:41.643 --> 28:43.744
Hey, blondie!
Yeah, airhead.

28:43.745 --> 28:45.513
<i>How long?
Five minutes, chef.</i>

28:45.514 --> 28:49.383
I'm getting different times.
My fish are overcooking

28:49.384 --> 28:52.553
because Susan can't let me know
how much longer.

28:52.554 --> 28:53.754
What's all this for?

28:53.755 --> 28:55.489
<i>It's overcooked, all that.</i>

28:55.490 --> 28:56.457
Yes, chef.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.725
Oh, no.

28:57.726 --> 28:59.093
How long's it been sat there?

28:59.094 --> 29:01.262
It's been sitting here
for five minutes.

29:03.732 --> 29:07.201
Why aren't you communicating?
Do you care?

29:07.202 --> 29:09.003
Jessica's a mess tonight,

29:09.004 --> 29:12.039
but it didn't help that meat
was giving us inaccurate times.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.374
So how long
for the chef's table?

29:13.375 --> 29:16.343
It'll be seven minutes, chef.

29:16.344 --> 29:19.346
While the VIP
table continues to wait...

29:19.347 --> 29:20.714
<i>The two halibuts,
we can go with that.</i>

29:20.715 --> 29:22.483
Okay.

29:22.484 --> 29:24.285
<i>Good. Let's go.</i>

29:24.286 --> 29:26.120
Table 22,
we'll go with that now.

29:26.121 --> 29:27.354
Chef Ramsay pushes forward

29:27.355 --> 29:29.390
with some of the red team's
other tables.

29:29.391 --> 29:30.758
Really good.

29:30.759 --> 29:32.359
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

29:32.360 --> 29:33.961
<i>Barret, come on!
Yes, chef.</i>

29:33.962 --> 29:35.429
Barret is finally ready

29:35.430 --> 29:38.032
with his second attempt
at the VIP table's entrees.

29:38.033 --> 29:39.934
<i>halibut, please.
Yeah, lovely.</i>

29:39.935 --> 29:42.036
Zach, serve one of the courses
to the chef's table.

29:42.037 --> 29:44.405
Yes, chef.
Go.

29:44.406 --> 29:46.407
At this point, I
mean, we really can't afford

29:46.408 --> 29:47.908
to have anything done
improperly...

29:47.909 --> 29:50.044
Two Wellington, two halibut,
two lamb. How long?

29:50.045 --> 29:51.211
Three minutes, chef.

29:51.212 --> 29:54.415
And unfortunately,
we're depending on Dan.

29:54.416 --> 29:55.516
<i>Start slicing lamb, oui?</i>

29:55.517 --> 29:56.550
Slicing.

29:56.551 --> 29:57.751
Gorgeous.

29:57.752 --> 30:01.355
I'm on the meat station tonight,
riding solo.

30:01.356 --> 30:03.624
The spotlight is on me.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.392
Hey, I'm ready to walk lamb.

30:05.393 --> 30:06.860
90 seconds, 90 seconds.

30:06.861 --> 30:07.861
<i>Hey, Barret? Yes, chef?</i>

30:07.862 --> 30:08.829
Hurry up, will you please?

30:08.830 --> 30:10.264
Yes, chef.

30:10.265 --> 30:11.231
<i>Go ahead, buddy.</i>

30:11.232 --> 30:12.433
It's a perfect lamb.

30:15.937 --> 30:17.972
<i>Yeah. Service, please.</i>

30:19.007 --> 30:22.710
Ooh, Michael,
you see that lamb?

30:22.711 --> 30:25.579
"Dan." "Yes, chef?"
"Perfect."

30:25.580 --> 30:27.348
I know, I cooked it.

30:27.349 --> 30:28.682
Good job, guys. Dan,
you're doing awesome, buddy.

30:28.683 --> 30:29.717
Thank you.

30:29.718 --> 30:30.918
Winner.

30:30.919 --> 30:33.320
I'm like Charlie Sheen.
All I do is win.

30:33.321 --> 30:34.321
Beautifully cooked.

30:34.322 --> 30:35.789
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

30:35.790 --> 30:37.458
While Dan is
having his best dinner service

30:37.459 --> 30:38.726
in Hell's Kitchen so far...

30:38.727 --> 30:40.661
Here is your cod, sir.

30:40.662 --> 30:43.297
The VIPs at the
chef's table in the red kitchen

30:43.298 --> 30:44.298
are getting their entrees.

30:44.299 --> 30:45.666
Your lamb.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.235
Thank you so much, appreciate it.
You're very welcome.

30:48.236 --> 30:49.670
It's... all the food
is delicious.

30:49.671 --> 30:50.738
And now, the red team...

30:50.739 --> 30:52.072
Last ticket.

30:52.073 --> 30:54.074
Is moving on
to their final ticket.

30:54.075 --> 30:55.643
Two Wellington,
one cod, one halibut.

30:55.644 --> 30:57.945
Coming down the line.
Walking with entrees.

30:57.946 --> 31:00.047
Halibut arriving, chef.

31:02.450 --> 31:04.551
Halibut's raw.

31:08.023 --> 31:09.757
<i>Halibut is raw.</i>

31:09.758 --> 31:13.260
Does it bother you, at least?
No, you're not bothered?

31:13.261 --> 31:15.429
Hey, look.
She doesn't care anymore.

31:15.430 --> 31:17.798
<i>She's going through
the motions.</i>

31:17.799 --> 31:19.233
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

31:19.234 --> 31:20.601
Hey, you're done, aren't you?

31:20.602 --> 31:22.703
No, chef, I'm not.

31:22.704 --> 31:23.704
While the women...

31:23.705 --> 31:25.406
Come on, ladies, come on.

31:25.407 --> 31:28.575
Try to recover from
Jessica's blunder, the men...

31:28.576 --> 31:30.644
Chef, I'm right behind you
with three Wellingtons.

31:30.645 --> 31:33.047
Are delivering their
last set of entrees to the pass.

31:33.048 --> 31:35.015
Dan, the Wellington's
cooked perfectly.

31:35.016 --> 31:35.983
Thank you, chef.

31:35.984 --> 31:37.151
<i>Good job, Dan.
Thank you.</i>

31:37.152 --> 31:38.318
They're just missing...

31:38.319 --> 31:40.854
Two halibut.
I'm dying!

31:40.855 --> 31:42.189
<i>Barret, talk to me!
Two...</i>

31:42.190 --> 31:44.058
Two halibut, four minutes out.

31:45.126 --> 31:46.260
Yeah, I'm waiting
for two halibut.

31:46.261 --> 31:48.228
Go, and come back
for the halibut, please. Quick.

31:48.229 --> 31:49.697
<i>Barret!
Yes, chef.</i>

31:49.698 --> 31:51.398
I put you on there tonight
to test you. Come on!

31:51.399 --> 31:52.933
Yes, chef.
I got it.

31:52.934 --> 31:55.235
Come on, Barret,
let's hammer this halibut out

31:55.236 --> 31:56.236
so we can finish this service.

31:56.237 --> 31:57.771
<i>Halibut, how long?</i>

31:57.772 --> 31:59.306
Coming right up behind me.

31:59.307 --> 32:00.908
They are plating it now.

32:00.909 --> 32:02.476
It's okay.

32:04.379 --> 32:07.081
Hey, all of you, come here.

32:08.383 --> 32:12.553
See those six glamorous ladies,
slightly older? Yeah?

32:12.554 --> 32:14.254
And look.
Oh.

32:14.255 --> 32:16.924
Oh, my God.

32:25.539 --> 32:27.506
It's two hours
into dinner service...

32:27.507 --> 32:30.142
Come on, Barret.
Yes, chef.

32:30.143 --> 32:32.044
And Barret has finally
delivered two orders of halibut

32:32.045 --> 32:34.080
to complete
the blue team's last ticket.

32:34.081 --> 32:36.282
Oh, my God.

32:36.283 --> 32:37.616
But chef Ramsay...

32:37.617 --> 32:38.884
Hey, all of you, come here.

32:38.885 --> 32:40.619
Is not exactly pleased.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.821
Look.

32:41.822 --> 32:43.789
The paper.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.491
<i>Paper.
Oh, my God.</i>

32:45.492 --> 32:46.559
<i>Paper.</i>

32:46.560 --> 32:47.660
You left the parchment
on it, man?

32:47.661 --> 32:49.195
What, you
trying to kill people?

32:49.196 --> 32:50.529
By the time you swallow it,
it's too late.

32:50.530 --> 32:54.300
You're on the floor with
Jean-Philippe doing CPR on you.

32:54.301 --> 32:56.535
Who the want that?

32:56.536 --> 32:58.704
Hey, come here, you.
Yes, chef.

32:58.705 --> 33:00.706
joke.
You should be ashamed.

33:00.707 --> 33:03.142
I am.
I am ashamed.

33:03.143 --> 33:04.643
Tonight, of all nights,

33:04.644 --> 33:08.514
I'm just praying that we didn't
lose this dinner service.

33:08.515 --> 33:12.885
Paper. To a senior.

33:12.886 --> 33:15.121
While Barret
starts over on the fish,

33:15.122 --> 33:16.889
in the red kitchen,
the women are very excited...

33:16.890 --> 33:18.624
This is our last ticket!

33:18.625 --> 33:19.992
To be closing
in on the finish line.

33:19.993 --> 33:21.460
We got this!

33:21.461 --> 33:22.628
Hey.
Yes, chef?

33:22.629 --> 33:24.597
Shut the up.

33:24.598 --> 33:26.632
High-fiving each other.
"Last ticket."

33:26.633 --> 33:29.168
It's the same ticket.

33:29.169 --> 33:31.103
Two Wellington, two chicken,
one halibut, one cod.

33:31.104 --> 33:32.571
Wellington walking!

33:32.572 --> 33:34.073
Cod.

33:34.074 --> 33:37.443
<i>Let's go.
Behind. Hot.</i>

33:39.913 --> 33:43.849
Finally.
Service, please. Go.

33:43.850 --> 33:45.818
Zach. Zach!

33:45.819 --> 33:48.354
Serve it.

33:48.355 --> 33:50.222
Both kitchens...

33:50.223 --> 33:52.024
Service, please.

33:52.025 --> 33:54.326
Finally manage to successfully
deliver properly cooked fish.

33:54.327 --> 33:55.528
There you are.
Thank you.

33:55.529 --> 33:57.063
Here you are, my love.

33:57.064 --> 33:58.664
I apologize
about the wait, ladies,

33:58.665 --> 34:00.266
and I apologize
about the mistakes.

34:00.267 --> 34:01.934
And dinner
service is complete.

34:01.935 --> 34:03.369
Suck .

34:03.370 --> 34:05.004
But no one is in
the mood for celebrating.

34:05.005 --> 34:09.574
Stoves off.

34:09.576 --> 34:12.378
I really thought that this was
gonna be a night to remember.

34:12.379 --> 34:16.715
I didn't expect
such ridiculous errors.

34:16.716 --> 34:18.150
<i>And that is why
I have no choice</i>

34:18.150 --> 34:21.887
but to declare the red team...

34:21.888 --> 34:23.289
<i>And the blue team...</i>

34:23.290 --> 34:24.590
As losers.

34:24.591 --> 34:29.594
<i>It's time to drop
some dead weight.</i>

34:29.596 --> 34:33.966
Each team, nominate your two
weakest chefs for elimination.

34:35.534 --> 34:36.869
Got it?
Yes, chef.

34:36.870 --> 34:38.370
Get out of here.

34:38.371 --> 34:39.705
Yes, chef.

34:39.706 --> 34:42.308
The blue team...
they may have lost today,

34:42.309 --> 34:44.877
<i>but a little victory pour moi,
right here.</i>

34:44.878 --> 34:48.147
This is definitely
a dinner service

34:48.148 --> 34:51.484
that I wanna crumble up
into a ball and throw away.

34:51.485 --> 34:56.054
Just complete
and utter chaos tonight.

34:56.056 --> 34:57.723
It was two people
on fish station,

34:57.724 --> 34:59.458
and fish still went down.

34:59.459 --> 35:02.962
<i>Jessica, you should've
taken responsibility.</i>

35:02.963 --> 35:04.029
I did, how many times
am I supposed to ask

35:04.030 --> 35:06.065
before she comes up
with an answer?

35:06.066 --> 35:09.535
You can't keep blaming it on me,
Jessica, seriously.

35:09.536 --> 35:10.769
I was talking tonight.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.538
I was confident in my station.

35:12.539 --> 35:13.772
I still deserve to be here.

35:13.773 --> 35:15.141
I just wanna say this.

35:15.142 --> 35:16.709
It was, like, at least
eight or nine pieces

35:16.710 --> 35:20.546
of halibut thrown away tonight.

35:20.547 --> 35:21.714
I did see a lot of fish
go in the garbage.

35:21.715 --> 35:24.183
Is it because
they're cooking fish bad?

35:24.184 --> 35:26.719
It was the re-fires.

35:26.720 --> 35:27.720
Look, if Susan
doesn't go up tonight,

35:27.721 --> 35:28.854
that's not right, dude.

35:28.855 --> 35:31.991
She didn't communicate
on the meat station,

35:31.992 --> 35:34.627
and that us
very badly, so...

35:34.628 --> 35:37.396
But I was by myself, and I think
communication goes both ways.

35:37.397 --> 35:40.933
I am absolutely not
the weakest chef here.

35:40.934 --> 35:42.368
If I am up
for elimination tonight,

35:42.369 --> 35:45.371
I will not go down
without the biggest fight

35:45.372 --> 35:46.372
that you have ever seen.

35:46.373 --> 35:47.573
Well, who's the weakest chef?

35:47.574 --> 35:49.642
None of us are.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.882
Logically, the only way
to do this

35:56.883 --> 35:59.251
<i>is we gotta put Barret up
because he up tonight.</i>

35:59.252 --> 36:01.453
Fish put us to a grinding halt
during dinner service.

36:01.454 --> 36:02.454
I'm gonna agree with Barret.

36:02.455 --> 36:03.923
I don't deserve to go home.

36:03.924 --> 36:06.492
<i>What made me get backed up
was Raymond on tableside.</i>

36:06.493 --> 36:10.029
If anybody should be going home
tonight, it should be Ray.

36:10.030 --> 36:12.498
51 years old,
memory's really not there.

36:12.499 --> 36:16.302
He gets jumbled up sometimes.
He's the weakest link.

36:16.303 --> 36:18.103
Okay, so, second vote?

36:18.104 --> 36:19.271
Raymond.
My reason is the tableside.

36:19.272 --> 36:21.140
<i>It screwed us up
in the kitchen.</i>

36:21.141 --> 36:22.675
<i>It just caused problems.</i>

36:22.676 --> 36:24.243
Yeah, but dude, it...

36:24.244 --> 36:25.244
the people that got
my dim sum liked it,

36:25.245 --> 36:26.445
they had a good time.

36:26.446 --> 36:27.846
I don't deserve to be
up for nomination.

36:27.847 --> 36:29.215
I've been doing this
for a long time,

36:29.216 --> 36:31.150
I'm older than these guys,

36:31.151 --> 36:33.552
I am better
than these guys.

36:33.553 --> 36:35.254
Chef tells us whenever
we go for elimination,

36:35.255 --> 36:38.090
<i>two weakest chefs on the team,</i>

36:38.091 --> 36:39.458
not who had a bad service.

36:39.459 --> 36:42.261
<i>So the person that we should
be putting up right now</i>

36:42.262 --> 36:45.064
<i>would be Dan.</i>

36:45.065 --> 36:48.601
What? Are you kidding me?
you guys.

36:48.602 --> 36:51.237
No, that's some
backhanded .

36:51.238 --> 36:52.605
You're dead weight.

36:52.606 --> 36:53.806
Everything I sent out
was beautiful.

36:53.807 --> 36:55.708
<i>I see how it is.</i>

36:55.709 --> 36:56.709
Put me up on the heels
of a perfect service,

36:56.710 --> 36:58.777
let's see how that ends.

37:07.954 --> 37:09.622
Red team,
have you reached a decision?

37:09.623 --> 37:10.990
Yes, chef.

37:10.991 --> 37:12.391
<i>Thank goodness for that.
Mary?</i>

37:12.392 --> 37:13.392
Yes, chef?

37:13.393 --> 37:14.994
First nominee and why, please.

37:14.995 --> 37:16.695
<i>Our first nominee tonight</i>

37:16.696 --> 37:17.796
is Jessica, chef.

37:17.797 --> 37:18.964
Jessica.

37:18.965 --> 37:21.000
She was the driver
of the fish station tonight,

37:21.001 --> 37:23.402
and just... the communication

37:23.403 --> 37:24.937
between meat
and fish tonight, chef.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.072
Second nominee and why.

37:27.073 --> 37:29.408
Our second nominee is...

37:29.409 --> 37:31.844
<i>Susan. Susan.</i>

37:31.845 --> 37:33.846
Just inconsistent
time calling, chef.

37:33.847 --> 37:36.115
Uh, blue team,

37:36.116 --> 37:37.583
<i>have you reached a decision?</i>

37:37.584 --> 37:38.717
Yes, chef.

37:38.718 --> 37:41.153
Dan, you worked
singlehandedly this evening.

37:41.154 --> 37:43.355
Blue team's
first nominee and why?

37:43.356 --> 37:46.325
Blue team's first nominee
is myself, chef.

37:46.326 --> 37:47.893
And why?

37:47.894 --> 37:49.261
I'm the weakest member
of the team, chef.

37:49.262 --> 37:51.030
<i>I had a fantastic performance,</i>

37:51.031 --> 37:53.332
and they put me up
'cause I'm the weakest.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.466
Jon, you're shaking your head.

37:54.467 --> 37:56.769
We feel like he's constantly

37:56.770 --> 37:59.138
<i>just slipping
through the cracks.</i>

37:59.139 --> 38:01.307
Um, second nominee and why.

38:01.308 --> 38:05.811
The second-weakest link
in the team...

38:05.812 --> 38:07.813
Uh...

38:13.109 --> 38:15.677
After an
inconsistent dinner service,

38:15.678 --> 38:17.178
chef Ramsay
has asked both teams

38:17.179 --> 38:19.681
to nominate two people
for elimination.

38:19.682 --> 38:20.915
The red team has chosen...

38:20.916 --> 38:21.983
Susan.

38:21.984 --> 38:22.984
And...

38:22.985 --> 38:24.352
Jessica.

38:24.353 --> 38:26.354
And the blue
team has decided on...

38:26.355 --> 38:28.189
Blue team's first nominee
is myself, chef.

38:28.190 --> 38:29.958
And their
second nominee is...

38:29.959 --> 38:31.793
Uh...

38:31.794 --> 38:33.128
Raymond, chef.

38:33.129 --> 38:35.096
<i>According to the team,
had a lackluster performance</i>

38:35.097 --> 38:36.564
that could've set us behind.

38:36.565 --> 38:40.235
Okay, Dan, Raymond,
Susan, Jessica,

38:40.236 --> 38:43.238
step forward, please.

38:43.239 --> 38:45.273
Jessica,
watching you on service

38:45.274 --> 38:47.542
<i>is like deadpan, no response.</i>

38:47.543 --> 38:49.377
And you have this blank stare.

38:49.378 --> 38:51.946
<i>Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:51.947 --> 38:53.314
Chef, I'm not done here.

38:53.315 --> 38:55.283
It wasn't my best performance.

38:55.284 --> 38:57.585
I have so much more to prove,
and I have so much more to give.

38:57.586 --> 39:02.090
I think you trashed more fish
than you actually served.

39:02.091 --> 39:04.192
Susan, timing was way off.

39:04.193 --> 39:05.727
Yes, chef.

39:05.728 --> 39:07.195
No control, no communication.

39:07.196 --> 39:09.464
I did make some mistakes
tonight, chef,

39:09.465 --> 39:10.765
<i>but I guarantee you</i>

39:10.766 --> 39:12.801
that I will come back,
I will fight,

39:12.802 --> 39:14.903
and I will prove to you
that I will be better

39:14.904 --> 39:16.604
<i>than I ever have been.</i>

39:16.605 --> 39:18.206
<i>I will make you
so proud of me, chef.</i>

39:18.207 --> 39:19.541
I promise you that, chef.

39:19.542 --> 39:23.044
Oh, dear.

39:23.045 --> 39:24.512
Ray, seriously?

39:24.513 --> 39:26.748
<i>I'm getting tired of you
standing in front of me.</i>

39:26.749 --> 39:28.883
Sure. I don't blame you, chef.
Yeah.

39:28.884 --> 39:30.919
<i>You weren't even cooking
in the kitchen tonight...</i>

39:30.920 --> 39:32.520
<i>I understand that, chef.</i>

39:32.521 --> 39:33.788
And you're nominated.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.690
I know you're looking
for a chef/line cook,

39:35.691 --> 39:36.724
somebody to be on the line.

39:36.725 --> 39:38.193
I'm looking for a leader.

39:38.194 --> 39:42.730
<i>You can't even run
a trolley tableside.</i>

39:42.731 --> 39:44.132
Dan, why do you
think you should

39:44.133 --> 39:45.667
stay in Hell's Kitchen,
straight up?

39:45.668 --> 39:47.802
Figure I'm just gonna let my
performance in the kitchen today

39:47.803 --> 39:49.404
<i>speak for itself, chef,
that's why I should be here.</i>

39:51.941 --> 39:54.709
So, who should've been
up here instead of you?

39:54.710 --> 39:56.044
Based on tonight's performance,
Barret, chef.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.312
<i>Barret.
Yes, chef.</i>

39:57.313 --> 39:58.713
Is that right, Barret?

39:58.714 --> 40:00.115
<i>No, chef, we're
basing it as a whole,</i>

40:00.116 --> 40:01.916
as who is the weakest links
on the team.

40:06.722 --> 40:09.724
My decision is...

40:12.828 --> 40:15.363
Dan.

40:15.364 --> 40:16.331
Back in line.

40:16.332 --> 40:18.299
That's right.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.868
Stop.

40:19.869 --> 40:22.070
Here's why
you're not leaving.

40:22.071 --> 40:24.539
You ran the section
singlehandedly.

40:24.540 --> 40:26.274
Thank you, chef.

40:26.275 --> 40:28.409
<i>And whilst the blue team think
that you're not a team player,</i>

40:28.410 --> 40:31.045
one thing I'm gonna confirm
is you can cook.

40:31.046 --> 40:33.381
Thank you, chef.

40:33.382 --> 40:38.219
Now, the person
leaving Hell's Kitchen...

40:41.891 --> 40:42.924
Jessica.

40:42.925 --> 40:44.159
<i>Give me your jacket, please.</i>

40:44.160 --> 40:45.727
Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.

40:45.728 --> 40:47.962
I'm not feeling it.

40:47.963 --> 40:49.564
I haven't got
any more patience.

40:49.565 --> 40:51.399
Thank you.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.708
During this experience,

41:00.709 --> 41:04.179
I tried to stay very confident
and very strong,

41:04.180 --> 41:08.299
and that came across as
not passionate, and that sucks.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.069
I guess I just didn't
put up enough fight

41:11.070 --> 41:13.271
for chef Ramsay
to believe in me.

41:13.272 --> 41:16.774
Here's something
you all need to know.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.910
<i>We have got a long way to go,</i>

41:18.911 --> 41:20.845
<i>and only the passionate
will survive.</i>

41:20.846 --> 41:22.480
Got it?
Yes, chef!

41:22.481 --> 41:26.451
Now off.

41:26.452 --> 41:28.152
I'm a little bummed
that Dan didn't go.

41:28.153 --> 41:31.155
Chef Ramsay said he can cook.
All of us can cook.

41:31.156 --> 41:35.126
There's gonna be no living
with this kid after this.

41:35.127 --> 41:38.229
Starting now, I'm an individual.
the team.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.664
Chef saying that I can cook...

41:39.665 --> 41:41.933
that should be putting
a fire under everybody's ass.

41:41.934 --> 41:45.136
Now you should see me
as a threat.

41:45.137 --> 41:46.704
I'm putting everything
on the table.

41:46.705 --> 41:50.375
I don't care who I have
to fight, I'm gonna fight.

41:50.376 --> 41:51.809
<i>The end of the day,
I'm here to win Hell's Kitchen.</i>

41:51.810 --> 41:54.145
And that's what I'm gonna do.

41:54.146 --> 41:57.715
When Jessica first arrived,
I had high expectations for her.

41:57.716 --> 42:01.085
Unfortunately,
she let us both down.

42:05.024 --> 42:06.925
<i>Next time, on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:06.926 --> 42:08.459
Nedra,
we're running out of time!

42:08.460 --> 42:10.461
Can Nedra
face her biggest fear...

42:11.497 --> 42:12.630
What if we don't get to cook?

42:14.333 --> 42:15.733
Come on, Nedra,
you're killing us!

42:15.734 --> 42:17.568
Or blow the
competition for her team?

42:17.569 --> 42:20.772
It's only a matter of time
before we vote her off.

42:20.773 --> 42:22.273
And one chef's mistake...

42:22.274 --> 42:23.374
Pink chicken.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.010
Chef James's wife is pregnant.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.145
Oh, my gosh.

42:27.146 --> 42:28.579
May send someone to the E.R.

42:28.580 --> 42:29.948
Raw chicken.

42:29.949 --> 42:31.716
What the hell are you thinking?

42:31.717 --> 42:33.718
And it all
leads to a bombshell,

42:33.719 --> 42:36.087
as one chef speaks his mind.

42:37.957 --> 42:39.290
How dare you!

42:39.291 --> 42:40.491
Put that on TV.

42:40.492 --> 42:41.759
And walks out of Hell's Kitchen.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.760
you.

42:43.796 --> 42:44.762
All next time.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.531
Bitch, I told you!

42:46.532 --> 42:48.833
<i>On the wildest
Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:48.834 --> 42:50.068
<i>At this stage in the game,</i>

42:50.069 --> 42:51.302
<i>I don't expect to hear
"I'm sorry!"</i>

42:51.303 --> 42:52.803
Of the year.
