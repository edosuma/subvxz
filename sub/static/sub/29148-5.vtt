02:19.180 --> 02:21.057
We lost one of our own yesterday.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.643
Bernie Rubenstein.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.523
A man who loved beautiful women
as much as he loved a good parking spot.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.401
-[subdued laughter]
-[Sandy] Bernie was, well...

02:32.068 --> 02:33.153
you all know Bernie.

02:34.195 --> 02:37.115
Someone who was the biggest personality
in the room,

02:37.490 --> 02:41.411
even though he was usually the shortest.
[chuckles, sighs]

02:41.953 --> 02:43.037
He also hated gum.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.665
-[Bash] Mm.
-And green eye shadow.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.333
He... thought it was so tacky,

02:47.417 --> 02:52.380
which is why you will not find
a single green eyelid in all of <i>Rhapsody.</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:57.927
It's-- It's funny, I-- I realize most
of you knew Bernie as an old man, but...

02:58.386 --> 03:01.931
when he was younger, uh,
he was-- he was really something

03:02.015 --> 03:03.975
with his... dark hair.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.060
He actually hired me for my first job,

03:06.811 --> 03:09.022
straight off the bus from Ohio.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.442
He taught me how to do high kicks,
how to smile,

03:12.901 --> 03:16.905
how to put Vaseline on my nipples
so they always looked amazing.

03:17.155 --> 03:22.243
[chuckles] Uh... with Bernie gone, it's...
it's the end of an era.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.955
I mean, nobody really cares
about elegance anymore, or class.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.000
Now, people wear T-shirts in the casino,

03:29.083 --> 03:32.420
and there’s a Burger King
in the lobby of the Riviera. I mean...

03:33.463 --> 03:36.466
maybe it’s a good thing Bernie died
before any of that happens here.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.510
Anyway, enough with the nostalgia.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.014
When your shift is done,
have a drink at the bar on me.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.436
Chardonnay.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.899
Thank you all for coming.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.652
-I loved your speech.
-[Sandy] Thank you.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.821
His daughters wouldn’t let me speak
at the real funeral, so...

04:00.281 --> 04:02.784
Look, um, Bernie always said,

04:02.867 --> 04:05.161
"Talk to people
when they can’t say no to you."

04:05.245 --> 04:06.788
And so, in his honor,

04:07.121 --> 04:11.084
I would like to extend <i>GLOW’s </i>contract
until the end of the year.

04:12.835 --> 04:13.836
-[exhales]
-Um...

04:13.920 --> 04:16.005
Keep you a part of the Fan-Tan family.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.467
Sorry, you... you mean stay in Vegas
another nine months?

04:19.717 --> 04:23.346
Nine months. Yes.
Let’s say double scale for the producers.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.389
-Wow.
-[Sandy] I mean,

04:24.514 --> 04:25.848
we can work out the details later.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.226
Well, I think I speak
on behalf of all of us when I say

04:28.309 --> 04:30.728
-that this is an--
-That we need to discuss this. Um...

04:30.812 --> 04:33.731
It’s such a flattering offer,
of course, but...

04:33.940 --> 04:38.027
Wow, yeah, obviously there’s a lot
to talk about together. All of us.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.781
-Of course. You know where I am.
-Yes, thank you.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.703
What is there to discuss? This is...
This is everything we’ve ever wanted.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.497
[Debbie] The fact that you think
that  there’s nothing to discuss,

04:49.580 --> 04:52.750
-that's why we need a discussion.
-Sandy’s rolling out the red carpet.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.502
Not to mention,
you’re gonna make more money

04:54.585 --> 04:57.755
-than you’ve ever made in your career.
-It’s not about the money. It's about...

04:58.006 --> 05:00.675
the fact that I live in a different state
than my kid.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.135
Three months was already brutal.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.721
Brutal? Please. I seem to remember
more than a few amenities

05:04.804 --> 05:06.014
that have been making your time here
more bearable.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.724
[Rhonda] You guys, stop.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.476
We’re basically at a funeral.

[Reggie] She’s on the floor.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.823
I offered her a sports massage,
but she wouldn’t let me touch her.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.659
[weakly] Reggie, I told you,
I need soft hands.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.829
Soft. [whines]

05:30.997 --> 05:32.332
[panting]

05:32.415 --> 05:35.084
Hey. Actually, I'm-- I'm good down here.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.712
If your back is in too much pain
to get on the table,

05:37.795 --> 05:39.130
you should probably head to a doctor.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.216
Just do what you can, please.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.636
And, uh, maybe I’ll be able to get up.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.432
And I'll go soak in the hot tub.
And go to work. I’ll be fine.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.559
Okay.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.978
[slow instrumental rock music playing]

06:08.743 --> 06:09.911

06:10.995 --> 06:13.331

06:13.414 --> 06:16.209
-but I now have a B-minus average.
-[Sam] Mm.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.087
Uh, Billy sent me some lame demo tape,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.756
which is like one long,
desperate take-me-back plea.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.757
[chuckles softly]

06:24.217 --> 06:26.177
Whatever. It's-- It's all boring.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.097
No, not-- not to me.
I'm just happy to see ya.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.433
I'm glad you decided to spend
your spring break here. It's great.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.019
So, how's Vegas?

06:35.603 --> 06:38.064
Well, it... [stammers] This is it.
You're in it.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.233
It's nothin'. I mean, you know...

06:40.316 --> 06:42.235
Oh, you know what?
You’ll get a kick out of this.

06:42.318 --> 06:46.739
Uh, we lost Keith to some gig.
And guess who’s gonna be playing ref?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.450
-Ruth.
-No. Good guess, though.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.828
[Justine] Okay, who?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.206
-No.
-[Sam laughs]

06:55.289 --> 06:56.582
-Yeah.
-[Justine] Uniform and everything?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.918
-Yep.
-Well, now I gotta see this show!

06:59.001 --> 07:01.295
-[laughs] Yeah.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.964
No wonder you got so skinny.

07:03.047 --> 07:07.009
Well, I've-- I've also been dating
the hotel gym's rowing machine, so...

07:07.093 --> 07:09.971
[sips loudly] Uh...

07:11.514 --> 07:13.391
-You know--
-I wrote my screenplay.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.437
The one I promised I’d finish...

07:17.770 --> 07:18.604
Really?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.148
I finished it.

07:21.065 --> 07:21.899
Wow.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.943
Congratulations.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.072
That's a screenplay.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.159
Okay. First note: uh, it needs a title.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.743
Yeah, no shit.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.620
[flicking pages]

07:35.455 --> 07:36.539
Will you read it?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.834
[clicks tongue] I'd love to.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.837
Okay, but I need you to be
completely honest with me.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.881
-Especially if it sucks.
-Okay.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.300
I promise to be merciless.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.016
-Don’t read it in front of me!
-What--

07:55.099 --> 07:56.601
What the hell is wrong with you?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.394
What's happening? Where--
Where you going?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.355
I-- I don’t wanna be anywhere near you
when you're reading it.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.358
I don’t have to read it right now.
Can't we--

08:10.990 --> 08:11.908
[sighs]

08:13.159 --> 08:16.704
Got a tip from Chad the valet
that you were in here.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.539
[sighs] Of course you did.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.169
I don’t usually get drunk
in the hotel bar.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.463
It seems more professional here.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.092
[takes a deep breath]

08:30.718 --> 08:32.970
You said I could come to you
if I ever needed to.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.682
Woman to woman. Well, here I am.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.018
Not a good time, Debbie.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.480
If you couldn’t tell.
Imagine how you’d feel if Bash died.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.815
I'd... [stammers]

08:44.899 --> 08:49.362
Well, it-- it'd be very tragic,
given how young and handsome he is.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.155
You didn’t see Bernie in his heyday.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.408
Oh, God. I'm sorry. Were you two--

08:54.492 --> 08:56.619
God, no. He was a creep.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.412
And very short.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.581
But you know how it is.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.875
You hitch your wagon to a rich dreamer.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.794
The dreamer dies,
and your wagon is sitting

09:04.877 --> 09:07.296
on the side of the road
with a bottle of gin

09:07.547 --> 09:10.591
and a four-million-dollar showgirl show
to pull along.

09:14.136 --> 09:18.307
Look, I know you’re in mourning,
but also, uh, doing business,

09:18.391 --> 09:20.643
so it’s hard to navigate this.

09:20.726 --> 09:21.602
But, um...

09:23.062 --> 09:24.397
your offer is...

09:25.147 --> 09:29.110
like dropping an atom bomb on my life.
[chuckles softly]

09:29.193 --> 09:33.698
You’re telling me you didn’t have a plan
for if your show would be successful?

09:33.781 --> 09:37.660
I thought it would end after three months,
as planned.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.246
Is that what you want?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.416
I don't know.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.294
I wasn’t really thinking
that many steps ahead.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.007
If you want to be a good producer,
you should.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.552
[door opens]

09:58.514 --> 10:00.182
[indistinct chatter]

10:00.349 --> 10:02.560
Maybe I’ll swing by your show tonight.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.646
<i>Rhapsody </i>is dark
for the first time in ages.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.441
My husband has a poker game.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.527
[inhales deeply]
Better to cry in the dark with strangers

10:11.611 --> 10:14.113
than alone in a big empty house, right?
[clicks tongue]

10:19.869 --> 10:23.247
[Bash] Sam. Sam. [knocks on counter]
Sam, hey. Earth to Sam.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.498
-Hey, man.
-[Bash] Oh!

10:25.374 --> 10:26.417
-That's a lot of pages.
-Mm.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.461
-You back on the horse? Can I read?
-No.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.465
Hey. What do you think of that number?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.384
-Nice number.
-[Bash] Mm-hmm.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.927
You’re looking at what you'd be making

10:37.011 --> 10:38.763
if we stuck around in Vegas
for nine more months.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.015
Fuck.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.352
-That much?
-[Bash] Mm-hmm.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.646
If we want this money,
all we gotta do is take it.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.398
Sandy wants <i>GLOW </i>to play the Fan-Tan

10:49.482 --> 10:51.317
-through the end of the year.
-[Sam] Wow.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.027
Okay.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.112
-That’s pretty enticing.
-Yeah.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.324
I agree. So help me get Debbie
to come around on this thing.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.826
Together. You know,
I’ll be good cop, you be bad cop.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.913
She’s worried about... I don't know,
not being able to see her kid

11:03.996 --> 11:05.623
and the girls getting through the show.
Yadda, yadda.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.957
I say let’s deal with all that later.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.084
-You know what I mean?
-[Sam] Mm.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.088
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't wanna be put in the middle.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.589
All right.
I’m not putting you in the middle.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.800
You'd be on my side,
which is not in the middle at all.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.427
What happened
to “One for all, all for one"?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.804
Well, it's a bit more like,

11:20.054 --> 11:23.099
“Two against one
until we all agree... for one."

11:23.849 --> 11:25.851
C’mon man. This is why I kept you around.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.107
See, I thought you kept me around
to direct.

11:31.190 --> 11:35.277
[scoffs] Sam, let's be honest, all right?
I mean, you're on a paid vacation.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.531
But you can earn your money
by being the director who agrees

11:38.614 --> 11:41.617
-with the producer.
-Yeah, I’m not your fuckin' butler.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.996
You know? You can’t pay me
to be your friend, or to agree with you,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.417
or to tell you how fantastic
all your ideas are.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.461
Yeah, yeah. That’s right.
Instead, I’m paying you

11:52.545 --> 11:54.755
to sit around a fucking hotel room
and write another screenplay

11:54.839 --> 11:57.508
-that'll never see the light of day.
-Don’t throw your weight around.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.467
You're not good at it.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.220
You know what, Sam?
You’re lucky to have this job.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.972
And you should have my fucking back
on this.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.522
-[women laugh]
-[approaching footsteps]

12:11.814 --> 12:14.608
-Hey. How was your massage?
-Just what the doctor ordered.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.652
[as Ethel] You know what?
I could use a massage.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.696
My sciatica is killing me!

12:18.779 --> 12:21.741
You know, get those,
like, nice, warm, tiny hands all over me.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.868
[as Edna] Oh!
Last time I had tiny hands all over me,

12:23.951 --> 12:25.035
it was at the gynecologist.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.954
-[both] Haa!
-[Stacey] Yeah, that's-- that's good!

12:27.037 --> 12:30.541
Hey, hey, I have an idea.
How about I play a Biddie tonight?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.669
-Come on! I’d make a great Edna. Or Ethel.
-[Stacey] Uh...

12:33.753 --> 12:35.254
Last time we listened to you and Cherry

12:35.337 --> 12:37.715
about switching characters,
it did <i>not </i>go well.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.675
You know what?
I’d be down to switch characters,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.427
but I’m not touching Welfare Queen.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.095
I could switch with you.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.222
No-- No. We can't switch characters, okay?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.516
The costumes won’t fit.
It’ll be a complete disaster.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.477
Or it’ll be funny.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.273
You know what? It’s the last week.
Tammé’s right. Let’s, uh...

12:54.940 --> 12:56.192
Let's do it. Let's shake it up.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.652
-What about kayfabe?
-[Ruth] I’m with Carmen.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.822
Also, it's our job to do the same show.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.034
And it’s through the repetition
that you find out more

13:05.117 --> 13:06.243
about <i>your </i>character.

13:06.327 --> 13:11.582
But if we did switch characters,
I need to be Welfare Queen.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.794
She’s got all the best moves,
and I’m  the  only one, besides Cherry,

13:14.877 --> 13:15.711
who can play her.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.590
'Cause I'm half black?

13:20.007 --> 13:20.925
-You are?
-Oh.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.301
I mean, that's crazy.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.054
I knew that.
Well, I-- I call dibs on Liberty Belle.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.932
If anyone gets Liberty Belle, it’s me.
It was my character first.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.142
[sighs] Give it a rest, Reggie.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.145
If anyone's capable of making
Liberty Belle look good, it's me.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.647
Quick pitch. Jewish Liberty Belle.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.775
[indistinct shouting]

13:37.858 --> 13:39.568
All right! All right!
Everyone settle down!

13:40.986 --> 13:44.865
If anyone is going
to play Liberty Belle... it’s Ruth.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.784
[Jenny] Oh!

13:46.867 --> 13:49.870
-Really?
-Yes. And I am going to play Zoya.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.038
It’ll be like <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

13:51.121 --> 13:53.040
Or Freaky... whatever, Tuesday.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.377
Oh, come on. You’re an actor.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.170
Don’t tell me you haven’t wanted
to play other parts.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.382
Come on, just be Liberty Belle.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.678
Fine. [chuckles]

14:05.970 --> 14:07.304
It’s not the worst idea.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.973
-Junkchain.
-Yes!

14:09.056 --> 14:10.224
-[excited chatter]
-Yes!

14:10.432 --> 14:11.809
[Arthie] Oh, I feel great!

14:11.892 --> 14:15.020
Yes! Yeah! Yes!

14:15.104 --> 14:17.106
[indistinct chatter]

14:26.198 --> 14:27.616
My dad’s in the show.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.953

15:35.059 --> 15:38.395
I believe I’m due for a bone density test!

Eh, some of you beautiful.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.705

15:56.956 --> 15:59.124
[Arthie] Edna. We gotta go.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.212
All right! Hurry it up, ladies!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.798
We got more than one match

16:06.173 --> 16:07.341
[Tammé grunts] Okay.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.135

16:10.761 --> 16:13.180

16:36.996 --> 16:39.206
Hate me all you want.

I am cold and heartless

[quietly] Jesus fucking Christ.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.173
I feel nothing for you capitalist idiots.

Well, except maybe pity
for inevitable decline.

Let's see, what would scare you?

You have
very nice permanent hair treatment.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.488
-Thank you.
-You must be made of money,

17:11.739 --> 17:15.909
and therefore
have American secrets I can extract

Just because I'm a baptized member
of the Ebenezer Baptist Church

17:54.948 --> 17:56.492
don’t mean I won’t tear that ass up.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.787
How you tear up ass if you cannot walk

17:59.870 --> 18:01.830
-without walking aid?
-[crowd laughs]

18:02.164 --> 18:07.628
Excuse me,

-What you gonna do for our match?
-[Yolanda] I think I’m going to light this

18:32.569 --> 18:33.612
and say something like...

18:33.862 --> 18:35.864
[speaking Spanish]

18:40.035 --> 18:42.162
And then blow it in your face
or something.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.956
-[Rhonda] Oh, okay.
-[sighs] Okay.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.667
Um, I think instead of being Machu Picchu,

I’m gonna be...

Um, well, the top fits.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.346
-Okay, just wear your leggings.
-Oh, good.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.975
These crystal pantyhose
are too damn short.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.727
-Fine! Ditch the pantyhose!

19:16.155 --> 19:19.491
No, it's not.
It's not the same voice, Sheila.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.578
Okay?
She’s a white girl doing that voice.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.123
