00:03.336 --> 00:07.506
<i>(man speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:15.581
Dinner with your dad?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.049
Every Sunday.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.251
You want a doggie bag?
Every Sunday.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.090
Thanks.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.227
So, um... (clears throat)
how have you been?

00:30.597 --> 00:32.097
How's work? Um...

00:32.099 --> 00:34.366
That shop has quite
a reputation.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.467
What's the name
of the guy who runs it?

00:35.469 --> 00:38.537
Uh... Cyrus beene.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.639
(chuckles) you know, uh,

00:40.641 --> 00:43.575
He turned down
running harvard.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.079
(piano playing light jazz)

00:47.081 --> 00:50.716
(silverware clinking,
indistinct conversations)

00:50.718 --> 00:52.718
Olivia, if you don't wanna
do this--

00:52.720 --> 00:54.086
We made an agreement.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.121
I have dinner with you
every Sunday.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.123
You pay off
my law school loans.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.225
I'm here.
What more do you want?

01:00.227 --> 01:02.294
I am trying.
That's what this is.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.395
This is me trying.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.064
I've called. I apologized.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.665
I asked for a second chance
with you.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.200
I made mistakes.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.201
Mistakes?

01:09.203 --> 01:11.303
<i>We</i> lost your mother,

01:11.305 --> 01:14.306
And I was grieving,
and I did the wrong thing.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.209
I sent you away,
and that was a mistake--

01:17.211 --> 01:18.844
A terrible mistake.

01:18.846 --> 01:22.314
But I-I'm trying now.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.851
And when someone you love
is making an attempt at amends,

01:25.853 --> 01:28.187
You give them an inch.
You give them a centimeter.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.189
You don't extort payment
for your school loans

01:30.191 --> 01:34.626
And then shrug
for five sundays in a row.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.129
I... Am... Trying.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.298
You try, too.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.283
I'm good.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.320
(mutters)

02:01.322 --> 02:05.657
You asked how I am.
I'm good.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.494
I'm...

02:08.496 --> 02:09.628
(sighs)

02:09.630 --> 02:11.864
I have a boyfriend.

02:11.866 --> 02:15.434
Is he good enough for you?
(chuckles)

02:17.837 --> 02:20.839
How are you?
How's the smithsonian?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.774
Well, we're considering

02:22.776 --> 02:27.212
Adding a new mastodon to
fossil mammals-- <i>m. Matthewi.</i>

02:27.214 --> 02:28.881
Although paleontologists
don't think

02:28.883 --> 02:30.482
It warrants its own species,

02:30.484 --> 02:32.351
And because it doesn't
differ enough

02:32.353 --> 02:34.419
From <i>m. Americanum.</i>

02:34.421 --> 02:36.488
I disagree. (sighs)

02:36.490 --> 02:40.159
(chuckles)
now I'm rambling.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.693
I'm--I don't want to
bore you.

02:41.695 --> 02:45.731
You're not boring, dad.
(chuckles)

02:45.733 --> 02:49.368
So tell me more
about the mammoth.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.769
Ah-ah. Mastodon.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.471
A solitary creature,

02:52.473 --> 02:55.407
With sharper teeth
than its cousin.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.543
The mammoth
gets all the glory,

02:57.545 --> 03:01.947
But the mastodon was
the far more dangerous beast.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.782
How was it?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.851
(train wheels clacking)
it was...

03:05.853 --> 03:07.886
He's trying.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.521
So it went well, then.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.757
Yeah. It was good.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.926
I'd love to meet him
someday.

03:13.928 --> 03:17.663
I told you, introducing
my dad to people I'm dating--

03:17.665 --> 03:21.233
I'm not people you're dating.
We live together.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.368
And I will make a honest woman
out of you at any time.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.903
All you have to do
is say "yes."

03:27.607 --> 03:30.609
I told you...
I'm not ready to--

03:30.611 --> 03:33.445
I'm not gonna propose again,
liv. This is it. One time.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.780
Don't push.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.349
I love you.

03:39.252 --> 03:39.952
Edison?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.553
I'm hanging up now.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.489
I love you, too.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.631
Aah! (grunting)

03:52.633 --> 03:53.966
Hand it over, bitch!

03:53.968 --> 03:55.801
(grunts)

03:57.804 --> 03:59.271
(crack)
aah!

03:59.273 --> 04:00.639
(blows landing)

04:00.641 --> 04:03.842
(grunting)

04:04.911 --> 04:06.345
(grunts)
run.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.347
(blows continue landing)

04:08.349 --> 04:10.349
Aah!

04:12.953 --> 04:16.755
<i>At the jeannine locke/</i>
<i>president grant scandal,</i>

04:16.757 --> 04:19.424
<i>And, people, it just keeps</i>
<i>getting better.</i>

04:19.426 --> 04:21.426
<i>(woman on tv)</i>
<i>we've seen the e-mails.</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:23.895

<i>For the president</i>

04:25.266 --> 04:26.932
<i>He is freakin' hot.</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:28.767
(woman) ...Who leaked the news,
<i>the white house</i>

04:28.769 --> 04:30.669
<i>Has remained silent</i>
<i>on the accusations,</i>

04:30.671 --> 04:33.038
<i>Which, to my mind,</i>
<i>pretty much confirms</i>

04:33.040 --> 04:36.708
<i>That jeannine locke had</i>
<i>an affair with the president.</i>
<i>(voices overlapping)</i>

04:36.710 --> 04:38.644
Hi.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.047
Hi.

04:42.049 --> 04:47.886
(projector and camera shutter
click)

04:47.888 --> 04:49.655
What happened to jeannine...

04:49.657 --> 04:51.290
I know.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.358
We can't come clean now,
can we?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.593
No.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.361
It'll make you look like
you unzip your pants

04:56.363 --> 04:57.396
For anything with a pulse.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.997
Ouch.

04:58.999 --> 05:03.435
Sorry. (exhales)

05:03.437 --> 05:04.970
I miss you.
Stop.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.672
When something happens,

05:06.674 --> 05:09.541
Something is strange
or funny or...

05:09.543 --> 05:12.077
I met the dalai lama
last week.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.779
We played basketball.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.980
You did not.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.417
(laughs) I did. I swear.
He asked, so...

05:18.419 --> 05:21.019
No press. No witnesses.
Just...

05:21.021 --> 05:24.356
I shot hoops with
the dalai lama. It was...

05:24.358 --> 05:25.657
The man has a jump shot.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.559
(laughs)
he fouled me twice.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.394
It was surreal.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.998
And I picked up the phone
to call you.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.834
Something happens, and you're
the one I wanna talk to.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.436
You don't wanna talk to me.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.971
I only wanna talk
to you.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.007
I'm going after the white house.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
Clearing jeannine's name means
going after the white house,

05:43.844 --> 05:45.077
After you.

05:45.079 --> 05:49.848
It's gonna give the story legs.
It's gonna make it hard for you.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.983
She's an innocent kid.
Bring it.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.086
I won't hold back.
You better not.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.758
Somewhere...

05:59.760 --> 06:02.661
In another life,
in another reality...

06:02.663 --> 06:04.629
We are married
and we have four kids,

06:04.631 --> 06:07.065
And we live in vermont,
and I'm the mayor, and--

06:07.067 --> 06:08.934
And I make jam.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.137
And you make jam.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.878
I won't hold back...
With jeannine.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.913
I'm going to attack
the white house,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.682
And I'm going to go
for blood.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.884
Go for the jugular.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.019
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
you don't know where she is?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.055
You were supposed
to control this girl, cyrus.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.023
Now we've got
a bimbo on the loose.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.692
We made up
that she's a bimbo. Mellie--

06:33.694 --> 06:35.994
Just... Find her.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.530
(cell phone rings, door opens)

06:38.532 --> 06:39.531
(door closes)

06:39.533 --> 06:41.833
(ring)

06:41.835 --> 06:43.568
(beep)

06:43.570 --> 06:45.470
Doom, gloom,
fate of the republic. I get it.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.105
I'm calling to remind you

06:47.107 --> 06:49.641
That jeannine locke
is a gift from the gods,

06:49.643 --> 06:53.979
Manna from heaven, and yet
I haven't heard a whisper

06:53.981 --> 06:57.048
From the white house
confirming the affair.

06:57.050 --> 07:01.019
The president has been given
a hell of an opportunity, cyrus.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.521
Make him take it.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.922
Make him? <i>Make</i> him?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.558
The only thing I can make him do
is shut me out,

07:06.560 --> 07:10.095
And given what I read
in that folder about remington,

07:10.097 --> 07:11.897
You can't afford that.

07:11.899 --> 07:16.968
You do what you have to do,
and I'll do the same.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.437
You know, some people
just say good-bye.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.738
Good-bye, cyrus.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.606
(cell phone beeps)

07:21.608 --> 07:23.041
What about the trip to Italy?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.910
Sir?
The president
of the United States

07:24.912 --> 07:27.179
Cannot go to the land
of the bunga bunga party

07:27.181 --> 07:29.548
And field questions
about his sex life

07:29.550 --> 07:32.117
In front of the pope,
for god sake. Cancel it.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.652
Sir.
Right away.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.820
Sir, it's important--
what, ethan?! <i>What?!</i>

07:34.822 --> 07:36.621
I found jeannine.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.758
(camera shutters clicking)
good afternoon.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.561
I'd like to introduce you
to jeannine locke.

07:42.563 --> 07:46.498
Jeannine graduated
summa cum laude from berkeley.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.001
Jeannine is a loyal friend
and sister and daughter

07:50.003 --> 07:52.504
Who has worked tirelessly
for this administration.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.674
And most importantly,
jeannine locke

07:55.676 --> 07:59.845
Absolutely, positively
did not have sex

07:59.847 --> 08:02.247
With the president
of the United States.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.950
<i>By leaking her name</i>
<i>through anonymous sources,</i>

08:04.952 --> 08:07.252
<i>This white house is guilty</i>
<i>of slander,</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:09.621
<i>And I am representing her</i>
<i>pro bono,</i>

08:09.623 --> 08:11.990
<i>Because I have personally</i>
<i>been affected</i>

08:11.992 --> 08:15.126
By these brutal and underhanded
<i>character attacks myself.</i>

08:15.128 --> 08:18.230
<i>Yesterday the president</i>
<i>was having an affair with me.</i>

08:18.232 --> 08:19.698
<i>Today it's jeannine.</i>

08:19.700 --> 08:22.200
<i>Tomorrow, who knows?</i>
<i>All I know...</i>

08:22.202 --> 08:24.536
What'd you expect, cy?
It's olivia.

08:24.538 --> 08:28.106
<i>It's time this administration</i>
<i>stops hiding behind</i>

08:28.108 --> 08:29.975
<i>Anonymous sources.</i>

08:32.144 --> 08:35.981
(indistinct conversations)

08:43.189 --> 08:45.624
Huck?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.094
What happened
the other night?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.896
Where did you learn
to do that?

08:50.898 --> 08:55.133
Maybe I took karate
in high school.

08:58.738 --> 09:03.208
You can tell me.
You can trust me.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.978
I was a trained assassin

09:06.980 --> 09:09.814
For a secret offshoot
of the c.I.A. On u.S. Soil

09:09.816 --> 09:13.084
Called b613
run by a man called "command"

09:13.086 --> 09:16.588
In a paper company that's not
really a paper company.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.956
It's called acme limited,

09:17.958 --> 09:20.225
But really
it's called wonderland.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.261
Acme's in wonderland.
Welcome to wonderland, son.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.963
Then they put me in a hole,

09:24.965 --> 09:27.933
And then I wasn't
so good at my job anymore.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.835
And then I wasn't in wonderland
anymore. I was here,

09:30.837 --> 09:32.170
But I can still--
I can kill a man

09:32.172 --> 09:35.006
With very little effort
and a lot of joy,

09:35.008 --> 09:38.877
But I try not to. Okay?

09:40.713 --> 09:45.717
Is there medication
you should be taking, or...

09:45.719 --> 09:49.721
Anyone I should call?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.855
Huck?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.924
Do you think
you and your dad

09:52.926 --> 09:55.794
Could eat at a place
with cheeseburgers?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.128
I want a cheeseburger.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.907
(mouth full)
you learned to cook.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.776
(laughs) I started by
reading cookbooks for fun.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.813
Hmm.
Try it... With the wine.

10:14.815 --> 10:18.950
I don't really like wine.
I don't have the taste for it.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.720
Because you've never
really had fine wine.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.787
Try it.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.623
Go on.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.824
(silverware clatters)

10:25.826 --> 10:26.858
(huffs)

10:26.860 --> 10:28.026
(inhales deeply)

10:28.028 --> 10:30.095
(bottle clatters)

10:35.768 --> 10:36.868
Hmm.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.904
(sips)

10:44.110 --> 10:46.645
This is amazing.
Ah!

10:47.913 --> 10:49.314
Go here.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.183
Ask for miguel.

10:52.185 --> 10:56.755
Tell him that I sent you.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.157
They have the best wines
in the district.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.859
(pen clatters)

11:00.861 --> 11:01.826
Thanks.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.161
Happy to expand
your palate.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.096
And now...

11:05.098 --> 11:06.164
I'm fine.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.265
Mnh-mnh. You were mugged.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.333
I was saved.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.669
By a homeless man.
For the record,

11:10.671 --> 11:13.071
Hearing about it in an e-mail
was not fun.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.406
You call your father.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.440
Dad.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.775
Why are you even friends
with men

11:16.777 --> 11:18.209
Who live
in the metro station?

11:18.211 --> 11:19.778
He's...

11:19.780 --> 11:20.912
I don't know.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.946
He's sweet.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.982
At least, he's sweet to me.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.018
But when he was beating up
those guys,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.120
It was like
he was a different person--

11:29.122 --> 11:31.322
Someone... Scary.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.124
I asked him about it.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.994
You asked
the scary homeless man.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.829
And he said
he was an assassin

11:37.831 --> 11:39.864
For a secret
government organization.

11:39.866 --> 11:45.103
He called it...
I think it was "b613"?

11:45.105 --> 11:48.840
And he said it was like
the c.I.A., but on u.S. Soil.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.810
Have you heard
of anything like that?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.946
From my lofty position
at the smithsonian? No.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.416
But, olivia, this man
is homeless, a transient.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.986
He attacked a violent criminal
with his bare hands

12:01.988 --> 12:03.988
And then he explains it away
by telling you

12:03.990 --> 12:05.724
That he's part
of a secret ring

12:05.726 --> 12:07.158
Of super spies.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.928
He's clearly mentally ill.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.996
(silverware clinks)

12:11.998 --> 12:13.031
Maybe.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.365
Probably.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.867
Mm.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.938
But can you look
into his story? Ask around?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.173
Don't you have that friend
at the fbi?

12:22.175 --> 12:25.844
If you really want me to ask,
I will.
I do...

12:25.846 --> 12:28.880
Want you to ask.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.184
Please?

12:38.858 --> 12:40.959
Hmm.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.063
If it'll make you happy.

12:45.065 --> 12:49.901
(clink)

12:49.903 --> 12:51.770
(projector and camera shutter
click)
I'll tell you

12:51.772 --> 12:56.808
Which is currently hanging
by the very thinnest of threads.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.910
You need to grow some
presidential-sized balls,

12:58.912 --> 13:00.945
Get out there on tv,
and tell the world

13:00.947 --> 13:02.213
That you had sex
with jeannine locke.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.782
You confirm it.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.951
Then I confirm it,
and we put all this behind us.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.387
It's funny.
The things people forget,

13:09.389 --> 13:12.924
The things that you'd think
would be staring them

13:12.926 --> 13:14.025
Smack in the face.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.860
Like the fact that I am

13:15.862 --> 13:18.163
The president
of the United States,

13:18.165 --> 13:19.864
And I call the shots.

13:19.866 --> 13:24.302
You both threw an innocent
young woman under the bus,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.905
And now liv is going to make
that right.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.406
So when the media calls
and asks

13:28.408 --> 13:29.974
If jeannine locke
was my mistress,

13:29.976 --> 13:33.812
You will answer,
"absolutely not."

13:33.814 --> 13:35.914
And then you're gonna tell them
that this white house

13:35.916 --> 13:37.816
Owes ms. Locke

13:37.818 --> 13:39.918
One world-class
hell of an apology,

13:39.920 --> 13:42.487
Which we humbly hope
that she'll accept.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.988
And if we don't?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.156
Try me.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.294
(door slams)
one of my aides will be
giving you a folder.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.830
Whatever you've got planned,
mellie, unplan it.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.932
We cannot push, and this is
not the right time.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.366
He is my husband, cyrus,
not yours,

13:55.368 --> 13:57.569
And I will push him
however and whenever I want.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.338
Now one of my aides
will be giving you a folder.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.008
Every date I was out of town
during the last year,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.977
Along with the west wing logs
for the same period.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.512
Match the dates I was gone

14:07.514 --> 14:09.614
With the dates jeannine
worked in the oval--

14:09.616 --> 14:11.382
And you've got all
the opportunities she had

14:11.384 --> 14:15.453
Leaked by an anonymous source
of your choosing.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.621
You're evil.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.190
You're welcome.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.892
(woman)
breaking news at this hour--

14:20.894 --> 14:22.894
As unnamed white house staffers

14:22.896 --> 14:25.230
Now say that ms. Locke
and president grant

14:25.232 --> 14:28.166
Spent numerous nights working
alone in the west wing...

14:28.168 --> 14:30.935
Security logs confirm reports
that ms. Locke and the president

14:30.937 --> 14:33.304
Were the only employees working
in the west wing

14:33.306 --> 14:35.406
On nights when the first lady
was out of town.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.975
High-level
administration officials

14:36.977 --> 14:39.310
Say jeannine locke accessed
ms. Grant's schedule

14:39.312 --> 14:41.512
In a calculated attempt
to seduce the president

14:41.514 --> 14:42.914
When his wife was away...

14:42.916 --> 14:45.416
<i>That she was</i>
<i>burning the midnight oil...</i>

14:45.418 --> 14:46.985
This is ridiculous.
I was never

14:46.987 --> 14:48.453
Alone with the president!
She says--

14:48.455 --> 14:51.990
We're gonna need proof.
Jeannine needs an alibi

14:51.992 --> 14:53.091
For every night
the press is talking about.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.427
The nights you worked late--
who else was there?

14:56.429 --> 15:00.531
My friend ethan. We worked late
together every night.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.967
We sent each other I.M.S.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.137
That is how we show
I was never alone

15:06.139 --> 15:07.972
On instant messages.

15:07.974 --> 15:13.378
That can only be accessed
on the white house server.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.646
We may have something.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.648
Good. Get on it.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.150
(quinn) you never said your dad
lives in d.C.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.485
Olivia.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.922
Just, uh,

15:23.924 --> 15:25.256
Meeting your colleagues.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.926
And you must be huck.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.703
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

15:42.107 --> 15:44.008
(projector and camera shutter
click)

15:45.244 --> 15:46.444
Did you ever get a chance
to look

15:46.446 --> 15:47.946
Into that thing
I was telling you about?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.948
The b613 thing?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.716
I did.
There's no such thing.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.252
I-I even had my, uh,
buddy at the fbi

15:54.254 --> 15:55.553
Look into your friend

15:55.555 --> 15:57.488
At the--at the metro station.
And?

15:57.490 --> 16:00.058
<i>And</i> someone matching
his description was arrested

16:00.060 --> 16:03.428
Paranoid schizophrenic,
repeat offender,

16:03.430 --> 16:06.030
Attacked a couple of commuters,
in and out of jail,

16:06.032 --> 16:08.533
A rap sheet as long
as my arm.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.635
It's sweet that you care
about him, livvie,

16:10.637 --> 16:15.473
But some people are just beyond
even your ability to help.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.642
That doesn't sound
like huck.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.410
Well, it was.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.578
(silverware clatters)

16:20.580 --> 16:22.447
But are you sure
it was him?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.183
Olivia, you need to drop this.
This is a waste of time.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.351
I just don't think--
olivia.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.059
Yes, dad.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.464
(quinn)
that's olivia's dad?

16:39.466 --> 16:42.500
Guess so.
And he lives right here
in d.C. In town?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.568
Guess so.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.472
God, he seems so...
Normal.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.075
Why has she never
mentioned him?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.311
Well, if she hasn't
said anything...

16:53.313 --> 16:54.512
I'm sure she has her reasons.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.481
(scribbling)

16:56.483 --> 16:58.316
(olivia) we made a deal.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.418
(speaking inaudibly)

17:00.420 --> 17:02.520
My people you stay away from,
<i>especially</i> huck.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.188
I'm not here to talk
to your people.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.090
I'm here to talk
about jeannine locke.

17:06.092 --> 17:10.261
(speaking inaudibly)

17:10.263 --> 17:11.496
You need to leave.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.465
I'm sure you realize by now
that there is

17:14.467 --> 17:17.101
One thing
I have a say over.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.504
If you ever wanna see
jake ballard again,

17:19.506 --> 17:22.373
America will believe
it was jeannine locke

17:22.375 --> 17:24.642
That had an affair
with the president.

17:24.644 --> 17:28.212
How do I know he isn't
already dead?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.614
(high-pitched, singsong voice)
you don't!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.549
(chuckles)
what did you do to him?

17:31.551 --> 17:36.521
(laughs)
ask your friend huck.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.126
(speaking inaudibly)

17:45.464 --> 17:48.266
(wheels rolling)

17:48.268 --> 17:50.134
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
this him?

17:50.136 --> 17:51.502
No.

17:51.504 --> 17:56.074
Every time some 6-foot somebody
shows up in a body bag.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.809
I prefer to come down
every time.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.411
Must be big money client
looking for this guy.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.580
Something like that.
(drawer closes)

18:02.582 --> 18:05.283
(projector and camera shutter
click)

18:05.285 --> 18:06.551
I have to ask you
something.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.518
(door closes)

18:07.520 --> 18:09.387
It's about b613.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.662
I can't tell you
how I know this,

18:17.664 --> 18:19.730
But jake ballard
has been taken,

18:19.732 --> 18:21.766
And if I don't let
jeannine locke burn,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.734
They're never gonna
let him go, so...

18:23.736 --> 18:25.336
In b613...

18:25.338 --> 18:29.540
If you disobey an order,
what happens?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.676
Do they kill you?

18:33.479 --> 18:34.745
Uh, not at first.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.348
They spent a lot of money
making you,

18:37.350 --> 18:41.519
And they don't like
to lose their investment.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.522
So at first,
they try to reprogram you,

18:44.524 --> 18:46.424
Make you come back
to the fold--

18:46.426 --> 18:47.859
How?

18:47.861 --> 18:50.361
They use the hole.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.396
(exhales)
they use the hole...

18:52.398 --> 18:57.802
And darkness, isolation,
pain.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.504
And if that doesn't
break you--

18:59.506 --> 19:00.905
That's when they kill you.

19:03.609 --> 19:06.377
Well, that's when they make you
wish you were dead.

19:08.547 --> 19:09.914
(exhales)

19:11.583 --> 19:14.652
(dialing cell phone)

19:16.456 --> 19:20.458
I want "fanaticism"
changed to "extremism."

19:20.460 --> 19:21.926
And bring back that line
about the bay of pigs.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.295
That was good stuff.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.429
Sir?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.598
Thanks, guys.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.603
Hi.
I need you to tell me

19:32.605 --> 19:35.173
Is there a reason
he wouldn't be?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.541
B613 has him.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.577
He saved my life.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.845
He's good at that.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.715
Forgive me if he's not
my favorite person

19:44.717 --> 19:45.917
These days, liv.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.519
I know, but just... (sighs)

19:48.521 --> 19:50.821
Find out if he's still alive,
and if he is,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.723
Get him away from them,
please.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.425
For me.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.838
This is crap.
That arrest was illegal.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.473
And you accepted money
for a sex act, licorice.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.975
We have it on tape.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.311
I asked him first if he was
a cop. He said no.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.279
You know, that's not actually
a thing, right?

20:15.281 --> 20:17.281
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a david rosen.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.749
You found him.
Just hang on.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.718
You need a lawyer.
Do you have a lawyer?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.887
I know a lot of lawyers.
Judges, too.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.288
Perfect. Call one.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.723
I'm sorry.
Who are you again?

20:25.725 --> 20:26.958
Olivia pope.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.328
You know professor stewart
from georgetown.
Right.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.562
Right. You dropped off
that purse.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.964
Yeah, so I ran the prints
off it.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.632
Your homeless friend's
not in the system.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.733
Do you have a pen?
Yeah.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.237
He was just arrested
last week at union station.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.372
Nope. He's never been arrested,
ever, anywhere.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.974
His prints came back
completely clean.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.976
I'm sorry, mr. Rosen--
call me david.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.345
David, look, I'm just
a little confused here

20:47.347 --> 20:49.447
Because someone
specifically told me

20:49.449 --> 20:50.615
This man <i>was</i> arrested.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.383
Then someone specifically
lied to you.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.918
Anyway, great to meet you,
olivia pope.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.455
And that I blame him
for not forcing me at gunpoint

20:57.457 --> 20:59.323
Into a career
in corporate law.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.025
Sorry. Almost stole this.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.600
<i>I was a trained assassin. B613</i>
<i>run by a man called "command."</i>

21:09.602 --> 21:11.969
<i>Acme limited, but really,</i>
<i>it's called "wonderland."</i>

21:11.971 --> 21:14.772
<i>Acme's in wonderland.</i>
<i>Welcome to wonderland, son.</i>

21:49.408 --> 21:52.476
(objects clattering)

21:55.014 --> 21:58.716
<i>(rowan)</i>
<i>best wines in the district.</i>

21:58.718 --> 22:01.452
<i>Sorry. Almost stole this.</i>

22:05.858 --> 22:10.628
You're late, so I heard
all of the specials without you,

22:10.630 --> 22:14.098
And they are making
the most tremendous...

22:14.100 --> 22:16.500
Olivia?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.870
(piano playing light jazz)

22:19.872 --> 22:22.873
(projector and camera shutter
click)

22:24.876 --> 22:27.044
What's acme limited?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.346
Olivia...

22:28.348 --> 22:29.780
What do you do
for a living?

22:29.782 --> 22:33.584
It's fossils or exhibitions
or publishing papers.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.453
Don't lie.

22:37.823 --> 22:42.693
What... Do you do...
For a living?

22:46.898 --> 22:48.833
(voice breaking) dad?

22:48.835 --> 22:50.901
(gasps)

22:56.074 --> 22:59.443
Do you teach people
how to kill?

23:01.813 --> 23:05.082
Do you throw them in a hole
until they go insane?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.585
(gasps) do you work
in wonderland?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.925
I'm your father.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.729
How you are to behave
in my presence.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.064
You do not ask questions

23:20.066 --> 23:23.134
That you cannot handle
the answer to.
(cries)

23:23.136 --> 23:25.903
You do not make judgments
about things you cannot imagine.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.805
You don't know me
that way.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.141
You don't ever <i>want</i>
<i>to know me that way.</i>

23:30.143 --> 23:32.877
But if you push,
you will know me well,

23:32.879 --> 23:34.912
And that would break
my heart,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.148
Because I'm enjoying
these Sunday dinners

23:37.150 --> 23:38.649
That you make me pay for.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.051
Now you are on my dime.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.588
Pick up your menu,
order your meal,

23:44.590 --> 23:47.458
And tell me
about your day.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.711
(napkin thuds)

24:07.713 --> 24:10.114
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:10.116 --> 24:11.949
No.
(sighs)

24:11.951 --> 24:14.151
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
(drawer slams)

24:14.153 --> 24:16.020
(typing)
(door opens)

24:17.189 --> 24:19.123
(exhales) huck, did you know
that liv and her dad

24:19.125 --> 24:20.491
Used to have
a standing dinner date

24:20.493 --> 24:22.726
Every Sunday night
like clockwork?

24:22.728 --> 24:23.994
How do you know that?

24:23.996 --> 24:25.563
I hacked into liv's e-mail.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.031
Why?

24:27.033 --> 24:30.968
That's not a reason.
At least, not a good one.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.069
Relax. It's not like
they talked about

24:32.071 --> 24:34.004
Anything at all personal.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.040
But you know what is weird,
though?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.108
All their correspondence--
the e-mails, the dinners--

24:38.110 --> 24:40.010
At a certain point,
it just stops,

24:40.012 --> 24:41.879
And they never e-mail
each other again.
(typing)

24:41.881 --> 24:45.182
They must have had a pretty
big falling out, right?

24:45.184 --> 24:48.052
I know I've taught you
lots of things, but...

24:48.054 --> 24:50.955
You should try to be less...
Like me.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.090
Hey.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.793
You should be less like me

24:55.795 --> 24:58.028
And more like liv.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.730
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:59.732 --> 25:01.232
(closes door)

25:01.234 --> 25:04.034
Captain jake ballard
has been taken by b613.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.705
B613? I... I'm afraid
I don't know--

25:07.707 --> 25:10.107
Yes, cyrus, you do know.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.009
Well, I wasn't aware
that you knew.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.144
B613 has taken jake ballard,

25:14.146 --> 25:15.513
And I want him released.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.914
We can't ask for that.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.183
Cyrus.
This is not insubordination.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.152
It's just a fact.
We can't ask for that

25:22.154 --> 25:24.188
Because of the way things
were very deliberately set up

25:24.190 --> 25:26.757
Between that organization
and the executive branch.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.092
They don't answer to you.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.160
Their operations are
entirely walled off

25:30.162 --> 25:32.563
From this and every
administration--

25:32.565 --> 25:36.734
To ensure plausible deniability,
to keep you safe.

25:36.736 --> 25:37.968
I am
their commander-in-chief.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.537
No, sir, this is what
I'm trying to explain.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.171
You're not.
There has to be a way.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.241
Their only objective is
the stability of the republic.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.845
Sir, right now they are not
your biggest fans.
(huffs)

25:47.847 --> 25:50.748
And trust me, b613 is not
the kind of enemy

25:50.750 --> 25:52.816
That any world leader
would want to have.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.720
Just find out if ballard
is still alive.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.889
That's an order, cy.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.091
I'm still your
commander-in-chief, right?

26:06.197 --> 26:09.166
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

26:10.902 --> 26:12.636
I'm a friend of jeannine's.

26:12.638 --> 26:15.940
Jeannine I.M.'d you the night
the white house is claiming

26:15.942 --> 26:17.141
She was alone
with the president.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.976
I don't remember.
Don't have to.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.344
All you have to do is
pull the messages

26:20.346 --> 26:21.845
Off the white house server
and hand 'em over.

26:21.847 --> 26:25.249
Really? Because it's gotta be
a lot like using a bit torrent

26:25.251 --> 26:27.318
To illegally download movies,
right?

26:27.320 --> 26:30.054
I'm impressed with your wide
range of tastes, by the way,

26:30.056 --> 26:32.156
From french new wave
to "america's sluttiest moms"?

26:32.158 --> 26:34.024
Bet the white house would
love to know how much

26:34.026 --> 26:36.126
Of your government-issued
hard drive is dedicated to that.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.629
(olivia)
we good with ethan, the I.M.S.?
(the trammps' "disco inferno"
playing)

26:38.631 --> 26:40.664
I scared him straight.
We're good.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.132
Oh, thank goodness.
What now?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.768
Now it's time for america
to hear from jeannine directly

26:44.770 --> 26:46.170
To witness the strength
of her character

26:46.172 --> 26:48.038
First thing in the morning,
live.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.841
Live?
Quinn! Help jeannine
with wardrobe.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.743
Let's go, people!

26:52.745 --> 26:55.145
¶ ...Mother down
¶ burnin'

26:55.147 --> 26:56.847
What do we think?
Too short?

26:56.849 --> 26:59.083
We'd have to see how it looks
when she's sitting to be sure.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.085
Clearly you have a crush
on the president.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.755
It's obvious from that video.
I was joking around!

27:04.757 --> 27:06.890
You can't ex--
don't.
Don't get defensive.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.826
It makes you seem guilty.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.161
¶ ...Came in a chain reaction

27:11.163 --> 27:13.731
How how about this?
She's not amish.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.934
We need current but classic,
professional yet relatable.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.335
¶ I heard somebody say

27:18.337 --> 27:20.337
¶ burn, baby, burn

27:20.339 --> 27:23.240
Give us a minute, please.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.743
(jeannine sniffling)

27:25.745 --> 27:29.046
Do you know what time
it is?

27:29.048 --> 27:32.216
It is almost 4:30
on Thursday the 9th.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.751
I don't understand.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.086
(crying) I should be headed
to the hill right now,

27:36.088 --> 27:38.922
To the speaker's office
to hash out details

27:38.924 --> 27:40.391
Of the campaign finance bill,

27:40.393 --> 27:42.059
Which, I know,
it sounds very boring,

27:42.061 --> 27:44.762
But it is full of ideas--

27:44.764 --> 27:47.031
My ideas.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.199
And instead I'm shopping.

27:49.201 --> 27:52.336
I am discussing headlines,
all because somebody--

27:52.338 --> 27:56.173
One single person--
just whispered my name.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.208
Whispered that I had
an affair with a man

27:58.210 --> 28:00.878
That I have never even
been alone with.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.212
It is insane!

28:02.214 --> 28:04.081
It is.

28:05.283 --> 28:09.186
He had the affair,
you know?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.921
Everyone knew
it was going on,

28:10.923 --> 28:13.957
We just didn't...
(sniffles)

28:13.959 --> 28:15.392
Know who it was.

28:15.394 --> 28:19.196
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.864
(sniffles)

28:22.100 --> 28:24.068
You are going
to get through this.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.303
I am going to get you
through this.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.772
Your life is not over.

28:28.774 --> 28:32.843
Your career is not over.
I promise you.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.814
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
(engine rumbles)

28:36.816 --> 28:38.348
<i>It's unclear what exactly</i>

28:38.350 --> 28:40.050
<i>Miss locke will be</i>
<i>talking about,</i>

28:40.052 --> 28:41.985
<i>Other than the white house</i>
<i>spin machine</i>

28:41.987 --> 28:43.754
<i>That she says put her</i>
<i>in this position.</i>

28:43.756 --> 28:45.289
<i>(man) come on, brooke,</i>
<i>the real question</i>

28:45.291 --> 28:47.191
<i>On everyone's lips is if</i>
<i>the president's mistress</i>

28:47.193 --> 28:49.493
<i>Wasn't jeannine locke</i>
<i>and it wasn't olivia pope,</i>

28:49.495 --> 28:51.929
<i>Then who was the first lady</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

28:51.931 --> 28:54.331
<i>Frankly, mrs. Grant is a woman</i>
<i>of a certain age.</i>

28:54.333 --> 28:56.800
<i>It wouldn't be the first time</i>
<i>a powerful man's wife</i>

28:56.802 --> 29:00.504
<i>Which is a shame, because</i>
<i>otherwise mellie grant</i>

29:00.506 --> 29:02.473
<i>Is an intelligent,</i>
<i>accomplished woman.</i>
<i>(exhales)</i>

29:02.475 --> 29:04.942
<i>She could have had</i>
<i>a political career of her own.</i>

29:04.944 --> 29:08.879
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

29:08.881 --> 29:11.115
(lowered voice)
I'll be right there.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.154
(keys jangle)

29:22.894 --> 29:24.194
(lock clicks)

29:24.196 --> 29:29.032
(cell phone vibrating)

29:58.062 --> 30:00.364
Jeannine, thank you so much
for agreeing to meet me.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.099
Mrs. Grant, I just wanted
to tell you that I didn't.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.500
I would never.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.370
I know you didn't, dear.
(inhales sharply)

30:06.372 --> 30:09.506
But let's talk about
your future.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.279
(keys clatter)

30:20.418 --> 30:21.985
(sighs)

30:31.963 --> 30:33.130
(knock on door)

30:43.474 --> 30:46.376
Olivia. Why are you here?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.611
It's Sunday. I thought
we were having dinner.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.379
Of course. Uh...
(chuckles)

30:49.381 --> 30:51.348
I think I can whip up
something for the two of us.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.985
Three of us.
I just had to park the car.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.954
And you must be...
Eli.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.922
Eli pope.

30:58.924 --> 31:01.258
(exhales) she still hasn't
told you yet, has she? (laughs)
(laughs)

31:01.260 --> 31:03.961
Dad, this is
senator edison davis.

31:03.963 --> 31:07.531
He proposed to me,
and I accepted.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.933
Not immediately, of course.
She made me sweat it out.
(chuckles)

31:09.935 --> 31:11.235
But, uh, then...
I don't know.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.470
I guess something
just clicked for her.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.605
Uh-huh.
Edison was recently

31:14.607 --> 31:17.507
Appointed to
the senate intel committee,

31:17.509 --> 31:19.409
The one that makes sure
spies don't break any laws,

31:19.411 --> 31:21.411
Like disappearing
innocent civilians...

31:21.413 --> 31:22.613
(laughs)
(laughing)
that kind of thing.

31:22.615 --> 31:23.881
(laughs)

31:23.883 --> 31:26.550
It's a great move
for his career.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.318
Gives him a lot
of influence in this town.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.921
Honey, will you open
the wine?

31:30.923 --> 31:32.623
It needs to breathe.
Sure. Sure.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.892
Uh, the kitchen is in...
Right around there.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.126
Thank you.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.969
Give huck back to me.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.641
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

31:50.643 --> 31:53.944
Oh, my gosh, you scared me--
again.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.913
I thought we had a deal,
ethan.
Um, a deal?

31:55.915 --> 31:57.581
Yes, we did.
Hand the I.M.S over.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.083
But--but... I can't.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.885
Why <i>not?</i>

32:01.887 --> 32:03.921
Five minutes out, guys.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.522
Where's abby?
We need those messages.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.024
(cell phone chimes)
(exhales)

32:07.026 --> 32:10.460
Abby, where are you?
We're screwed, liv.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.362
She told ethan to destroy
the I.M.S, so there's

32:12.364 --> 32:14.965
No evidence she wasn't alone
with the president.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.967
Someone in the white house
must have gotten to her.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.368
She's gonna go on live tv
and tell the world

32:18.370 --> 32:20.070
She had the affair.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.209
(cell phone rings)

32:27.478 --> 32:30.314
(ringing continues)
(exhales)

32:30.316 --> 32:32.349
Nothing starts
until I give the okay.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.452
(ringing continues)

32:35.454 --> 32:38.522
(cell phone beeps)
was it you?
Did your people do this?

32:38.524 --> 32:39.589
Jake ballard is alive.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.591
They'll release him?
No.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.393
I tried. There are
protocols in place.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.962
No, they need
to release him.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.196
They won't. I'm sorry.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.998
Make them.
I can't.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.199
We're talking about
a man's life.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.500
It's out of my control.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.635
(knock on door)

32:51.637 --> 32:53.337
There's a reason.
What?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.605
There's a reason
that this is not vermont,

32:55.607 --> 32:57.607
That we don't have kids,
and that you are not the mayor.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.409
There's a reason
we are not happy.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.978
It's so you could be president.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.145
It's so nothing
is beyond your control!

33:02.147 --> 33:04.014
That's the point!
You bring him back!

33:06.517 --> 33:08.218
(door opens)
they're ready
in there, liv.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.388
Just give me... A minute.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.358
I save jeannine,
and jake dies.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.994
I let jeannine burn,
and jake lives.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.495
They want to start.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.998
Stall them.

33:23.668 --> 33:29.239
(door closes)

33:29.241 --> 33:32.642
(exhales) I'm asking you
to spare a man's life.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.212
As you know, what happens
to jake is up to you.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.518
I'll put Sunday dinners
back on the table.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.355
I'll take that
under consideration.

33:49.727 --> 33:52.229
(indistinct conversations)

33:52.231 --> 33:53.363
We're about to start.
(door closes)

33:53.365 --> 33:55.465
Just one second.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.103
(lowered voice)
going on television right now

34:00.105 --> 34:01.972
To admit to an affair
you did not have,

34:01.974 --> 34:04.708
Selling your soul to whoever
in that white house got to you

34:04.710 --> 34:07.778
Is not what's
about to happen.

34:09.180 --> 34:10.414
I don't know--

34:10.416 --> 34:12.349
Stop lying right now.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.687
(lowered voice) they are
giving me $2 million

34:17.689 --> 34:21.525
In a cayman account--
tax-free.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.527
Might as well
profit off it.

34:27.698 --> 34:29.466
You don't do this.

34:29.468 --> 34:30.801
You don't lie,

34:30.803 --> 34:32.369
Because every time you do,

34:32.371 --> 34:34.404
You sell
a little bit of your soul.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.706
And then you have to live
with those lies

34:36.708 --> 34:38.175
Eating away at you
month after month,

34:38.177 --> 34:39.509
Year after year,
until one day

34:39.511 --> 34:40.644
You're gonna look
in the mirror

34:40.646 --> 34:42.245
And you won't even
recognize yourself.

34:42.247 --> 34:46.116
Then you'll hate
what you see, jeannine.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.186
Believe me.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.462
(normal voice)
she's all yours.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.163
Great. Let's start.
(man) sound speed.

35:00.165 --> 35:03.433
Hold up.
We're being pre-empted.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.135
Are you kidding me?
By who?

35:07.538 --> 35:09.372
The president.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.708
He's about to speak live
from the briefing room.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.146
Sir,
please tell me right now

35:16.148 --> 35:17.647
What in the hell you are
planning to do here.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.149
Actually, cy,
that's up to you,

35:19.151 --> 35:20.717
Because we are playing
"let's make a deal."

35:20.719 --> 35:22.686
Behind door number one
is me getting up

35:22.688 --> 35:24.287
In front of the press corps
and telling them

35:24.289 --> 35:25.655
That you orchestrated
a cover-up

35:25.657 --> 35:27.357
And ruined a girl's life,

35:27.359 --> 35:29.292
Because all I've ever
wanted to do is tell the truth--

35:29.294 --> 35:31.428
That I had an affair
with olivia pope.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.497
Behind door number two
is me giving you

35:33.499 --> 35:34.731
Exactly what you want

35:34.733 --> 35:36.333
And telling that same
press corps

35:36.335 --> 35:38.535
How sorry I am to have
slept with jeannine locke,

35:38.537 --> 35:40.804
At which point you will
call your friends at b613

35:40.806 --> 35:42.539
And get them to release
jake ballard.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.374
Ballard? (lowered voice)
sir, I told you,

35:44.376 --> 35:47.410
There's no way we can make
b613 do <i>anything.</i>

35:47.412 --> 35:48.712
It's a simple choice, cy.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.780
Door number one,
I tell the truth

35:50.782 --> 35:52.682
And the both of us get kicked
out of this white house.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.818
Door number two, I admit
to the jeannine affair

35:54.820 --> 35:56.686
And jake gets released.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.156
What's it gonna be?
Because I'm about to go

35:59.158 --> 36:02.292
On live television
and need to know what to say.

36:02.294 --> 36:05.829
How presidential
are my balls now, cy?

36:10.201 --> 36:15.205
(camera shutters clicking,
reporters shouting questions)

36:28.719 --> 36:31.388
(train approaching)

36:31.390 --> 36:32.856
Huck...

36:32.858 --> 36:36.359
Uh, the, uh, 9:50
was 4 minutes late.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.762
It threw everything off.
You missed your train.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.731
It's okay... Huck.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.600
I can wait for the next one.

36:43.602 --> 36:48.338
(cell phone chimes)

36:48.340 --> 36:50.407
I have to take this,
but when I'm done,

36:50.409 --> 36:51.975
I'm going to buy you
a cheeseburger, okay?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.277
(cell phone beeps)

36:54.279 --> 36:56.846
I would've thought you'd
start with "thank you,"

36:56.848 --> 36:58.548
Given that you have
your friend back.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.916
I hope he's all settled back

36:59.918 --> 37:02.485
In his little
underground palace.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.788
<i>What...</i> Do you want?

37:04.790 --> 37:06.489
What every father wants,
olivia.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.525
I want you to be happy.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.361
I just have this
strong feeling that

37:11.363 --> 37:13.663
Senator davis isn't quite
the man for the job,

37:13.665 --> 37:15.899
Especially at the moment.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.235
What are you talking about?
Where's edison?

37:18.237 --> 37:20.270
Right now?
At washington memorial.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.705
He was
in a terrible accident.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.540
I'm surprised you haven't heard.
It's all over the news.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.509
I can't remember the details.
Maybe a broken collarbone,

37:26.511 --> 37:28.511
A leg or two...

37:28.513 --> 37:30.480
He'll pull through,
of course,

37:30.482 --> 37:33.416
But it sounds very painful,
so...

37:33.418 --> 37:37.921
When you give that ring back,
let the guy down gently.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.389
Poor guy's been through
enough.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.758
I will stay away from you.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.660
I will stay away
from what you do,

37:43.662 --> 37:45.695
But in return,
you will do the same,

37:45.697 --> 37:48.531
Because this is over!
We are done!

37:48.533 --> 37:51.534
We are family, sweetie.
We're never done.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.741
(camera shutters clicking)
good morning, everyone.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.409
I'd like to make some remarks.

37:59.411 --> 38:05.015
I have indeed taken part
in an inappropriate relationship

38:05.017 --> 38:07.417
<i>With an employee</i>
<i>of this white house.</i>

38:07.419 --> 38:10.453
<i>That person's name...</i>

38:10.455 --> 38:12.689
<i>Is jeannine locke,</i>

38:12.691 --> 38:15.725
<i>And I extend</i>
<i>my sincerest apologies to her</i>

38:15.727 --> 38:17.961
<i>And her family</i>

38:17.963 --> 38:19.996
<i>For any pain</i>
<i>that I've caused them.</i>

38:19.998 --> 38:22.832
<i>To put it simply, I am...</i>
<i>Okay, people,</i>

38:22.834 --> 38:24.401
Let's wrap it up.
<i>Ashamed and embarrassed</i>
<i>by my behavior.</i>

38:24.403 --> 38:26.069
(man) okay, you heard that.
We're excused.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.604
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

38:27.606 --> 38:29.973
Mr. President, a word.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.675
(lowered voice)
mr. President,

38:31.677 --> 38:33.910
I don't believe
jeannine locke was that girl.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.579
I don't believe jeannine locke
threatened your marriage.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.048
I don't know what it is
you're doing,

38:38.050 --> 38:39.983
But here's what I do
believe.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.918
I believe this is some kind
of dodge.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.586
This is some kind of slipping
through the bars.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.722
This is some kind of way out
of you keeping

38:45.724 --> 38:47.590
The promise you made to me.

38:47.592 --> 38:50.060
I believe that this is
some kind of lie.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.064
I'm not lying, sally.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.732
(lowered voice)
I had jeannine locke

38:55.734 --> 38:58.735
Six ways to Sunday
all over this white house.

38:58.737 --> 39:02.005
And after some soul searching
on all of our parts,

39:02.007 --> 39:04.641
I think my constituents
are going to forgive me for it.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.080
(indistinct conversations)

39:10.082 --> 39:14.584
Why would he say that we
slept together when we didn't?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.592
Where are you going?
Where is she going?

39:22.594 --> 39:24.728
We'll set up some interviews.
Network, print.

39:24.730 --> 39:25.895
Get you a book deal.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.430
It'll be enough
to retire on.

39:27.432 --> 39:28.932
Smile, jeannine.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.367
You're getting
what you wanted.

39:31.435 --> 39:33.903
I know you wanted me
to stop.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.138
You didn't?

39:35.140 --> 39:37.073
(sighs)

39:37.075 --> 39:39.442
Only because I was
doing what you said.
(closes door)

39:39.444 --> 39:41.044
I was being like liv.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.712
And my gut said there was
something in her e-mail

39:42.714 --> 39:44.714
I had to find.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.050
Here it is. Liv and her dad
are talking about

39:47.052 --> 39:49.753
Some homeless guy she used to
give change to in union station,

39:49.755 --> 39:52.489
A guy who saved her
from some sort of mugging.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.457
She's asking her dad
to look into him for her

39:54.459 --> 39:56.659
Right before
the e-mails stop.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.598
Didn't you live in union station
when you were homeless?

40:01.600 --> 40:02.766
Huck?

40:02.768 --> 40:04.067
<i>I want the deal.</i>
<i>What deal?</i>

40:04.069 --> 40:06.503
<i>I want the deal</i>
<i>she got for you.</i>

40:06.505 --> 40:08.471
<i>There was no deal, huck.</i>

40:08.473 --> 40:10.106
Were liv and her dad
talking about you?

40:18.549 --> 40:20.517
Huck?

40:20.519 --> 40:22.452
What's wrong?

40:22.454 --> 40:24.554
I have a couple
of questions.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.156
Literally two questions.

40:26.158 --> 40:28.525
First--why did you
lie to me?

40:28.527 --> 40:31.461
I've never lied to you.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.463
You said there was
no deal for me.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.098
You said no deal.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.900
But you used to talk
to your father,

40:36.902 --> 40:38.701
And then you got mugged,

40:38.703 --> 40:41.438
And I was taken from
the metro right after that.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.541
And then they put me back,

40:44.543 --> 40:46.743
But then they've never
tried to find me again.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.645
And you don't talk
to your father anymore.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.514
You stopped then.
You stopped right then.

40:51.516 --> 40:52.982
Huck...

40:52.984 --> 40:54.584
(screaming)

40:54.586 --> 40:57.587
How high up is your father
in b613?!

40:57.589 --> 40:58.822
Is your father command?!

40:58.824 --> 41:01.558
<i>Is your father command?!</i>

41:01.560 --> 41:03.593
(gasping)

41:03.595 --> 41:07.964
(breathing heavily)

41:07.966 --> 41:09.065
(gasps)
(exhales)

41:09.067 --> 41:12.502
(exhaling)

41:12.504 --> 41:14.771
Olivia...

41:14.773 --> 41:17.607
Is your father command?

41:17.609 --> 41:20.243
(huck breathing heavily)

41:20.245 --> 41:21.778
(whispers) yes.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.547
He is.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.222
(breathes heavily)

41:44.869 --> 41:48.004
(cell phone chimes)

41:48.006 --> 41:50.640
(chimes)

41:50.642 --> 41:52.942
(buttons click, beep)

41:52.944 --> 41:54.244
I never want to speak
to you again.

41:54.246 --> 41:55.578
Open your front door.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.013
Go to hell!

41:57.015 --> 41:59.616
Open your front door.
(door rattles)

42:07.258 --> 42:09.092
(gasps)

42:09.094 --> 42:11.294
Sunday, my house, 7:00.

42:11.296 --> 42:12.896
I'll choose the wine.

42:14.098 --> 42:16.065
Hi. (gasps)

42:16.067 --> 42:18.101
(gasps)

42:19.904 --> 42:21.304
(grunts)
