WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.220
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.264 --> 00:05.831
Excuse me. Excuse me,
what the hell's going on?

00:07.703 --> 00:08.878
Daddy!

00:09.661 --> 00:10.445
Denver.

00:10.488 --> 00:11.968
I think it's a safe zone.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.404
This place was supplying
the city with some kind of drug

00:13.448 --> 00:15.058
that they made here.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
Doc.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.321
I need you to guard this
with your life.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.235
What is it?

00:18.279 --> 00:19.410
Patient zero.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.846
You gave her blood
from the vial?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.413
Oh shit.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.240
What's the B'ah?

00:23.284 --> 00:24.981
Not what but who.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.548
I will show you.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.380
This is a reverie created by
another elder.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.468
Why?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.383
So I could learn how
to destroy you.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.517
Only light can
drive out darkness.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.784
Only the blood of the B'ah
can stop the poison.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.134
She's trying to get out
of China.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.570
Some place safer
so she can return

00:48.613 --> 00:50.137
and hunt again in my time.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.008
There is a freighter leaving
this evening.

00:52.052 --> 00:52.922
Headed where?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.619
San Francisco.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.056
Did you see it?
The B'ah?

00:56.099 --> 00:57.100
It's totem?

00:57.144 --> 00:58.406
Not exactly.

00:58.449 --> 00:59.972
But I know where it is.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.944
Oh, an entire city to search.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.555
I mean, I gotta say, as useless
as I thought the elder was,

01:17.599 --> 01:21.429
at least it would have got us
in the vicinity of the B'ah.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.909
I'm glad it's gone.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.738
The thing kept looking at me
like I was lunch.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.001
Yeah, we couldn't trust it.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.700
What if this whole thing
is a trap?

01:31.743 --> 01:33.180
Might be.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.920
Still doesn't change the fact
that we have to look.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
I know. I know.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.838
Kill the elder,
destroy the totem.

01:39.882 --> 01:43.407
Every death is a step closer
to you know what.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.888
What have we here?

01:48.804 --> 01:51.502
What do you say we have a
little look around for supplies?

01:51.546 --> 01:53.200
Axel, we need to keep moving.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.115
Actually we really need to rest.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.639
Yeah, I need some snacks.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.642
Alright.

02:00.685 --> 02:04.167
We'll check for supplies,
then we need to move.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.364
Oh.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.150
Definitely have company.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.415
Yeah, I think we're surrounded.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.200
Show yourselves.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.636
Drop your weapons!

02:38.680 --> 02:39.724
You first!

02:39.768 --> 02:40.769
No chance.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.380
Then we have a problem.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.643
We won't if you do
as instructed.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.167
You don't wanna mess
with me, kid.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.255
She's right, boys.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.561
Save your bullets
for the bad guys.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.606
What do you want us to do?

02:51.649 --> 02:52.563
Hold your ground.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.738
They don't look like vampires.

02:53.782 --> 02:54.957
Everybody stop talking!

02:55.000 --> 02:57.525
You should listen
to your friend.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.221
Jesus.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.440
[gun fire]

02:59.483 --> 03:00.919
Woah, woah, woah!

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
You're a lousy shot, kid.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.365
Holy shit.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.409
You're her.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.388
Next.

03:35.606 --> 03:36.912
Name?

03:36.955 --> 03:38.827
Uh, Sarah Carol.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.743
Number?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.005
It's on your shirt.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.615
I ain't got all day.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.052
4478.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.404
Now that you're
out of quarantine

03:50.447 --> 03:52.841
you're being integrated
back into society.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.278
In this envelope you will find
the address and keys

03:55.322 --> 03:57.019
to your living quarters.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.674
You're also being allotted
credit stamps.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.284
It's our currency here.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.939
It works just like cash did
back in the day.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.375
It's up to you to choose
how to spend them

04:05.419 --> 04:07.986
but know that the only way
to earn more

04:08.030 --> 04:10.293
is to contribute.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.947
There's no hand outs here.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.428
Don't like it,
you're free to leave.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.212
Any questions?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.780
When you say contribute,
what do you mean?

04:18.823 --> 04:20.782
It means get a job.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.046
Wait here.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.711
Here are your weapons
that were confiscated.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.843
We get them back just like that?

04:38.887 --> 04:40.105
This is still America.

04:40.149 --> 04:43.587
Recommended to be armed
even in safe zones.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.936
Comforting.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.329
Pardon me?

04:46.373 --> 04:49.158
Nothing, sir.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.291
Follow the hallway
down to the exit.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.249
Coming out!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.251
Welcome to Denver.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.080
Next.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.951
Name?

05:23.758 --> 05:26.369
What happened to Callie,
Jesse and McGrath?

05:26.413 --> 05:27.675
Um, they were released earlier

05:27.718 --> 05:29.459
and assigned to a different
sector.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.417
Huh.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.506
So much for goodbyes.

05:53.831 --> 05:59.881
Is it just me or does it seem...
normal?

05:59.924 --> 06:01.404
What's normal now?

06:01.448 --> 06:02.405
Not us.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.189
Speak for yourselves.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.366
I was never a vampire.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.065
Alright, who wants to see
where we're living?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.109
Yeah.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.548
I'm in building 6.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.853
Building 2.

06:15.897 --> 06:16.898
Me too.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.682
Oh, really?

06:19.509 --> 06:20.336
Oh yeah.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.946
Hey, we're roomies.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.599
Ok.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.774
[laughs]

06:23.818 --> 06:24.906
Is that ok? I mean-

06:24.949 --> 06:26.777
No. No, it's good.
It's good.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.257
It'll be great.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.520
Um, should we go see
where we're living?

06:30.564 --> 06:33.523
Uh, eenie meenie minie-

06:33.567 --> 06:34.176
Mo?

06:34.219 --> 06:35.003
Yes.

06:35.046 --> 06:35.917
Bye.

06:35.960 --> 06:36.613
[Both]: See you guys.

06:36.657 --> 06:37.962
See you around.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.358
Huh. Look at that.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.794
We're roomies.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.364
The nightmare continues.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.995
So what're your names?

07:11.039 --> 07:12.606
I'm private Patterson.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.609
That's private Raskin
and private Mendoza.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.958
Where's your sergeant?

07:17.001 --> 07:19.308
Dead. I think.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.920
About a week ago he took
first watch.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.009
We woke up to screaming.

07:25.053 --> 07:30.145
They... whatever they were,
they came from above.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.147
From everywhere.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.193
Nothing like I've
ever seen before.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.848
They looked like
ancient warriors or something.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.764
Between the gunfire and
the dark we couldn't see shit.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.592
They took three of our guys
that night.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.508
A few days later a couple more.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.510
No bodies.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.859
Just gone.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.905
There are other men?

07:50.948 --> 07:52.123
Where's your base at?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.647
Fallen.

07:53.690 --> 07:57.520
As far as we know
we're all that's left.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.435
You military?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.003
Marines, first division.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.700
You seen action?

08:03.744 --> 08:06.007
Tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.183
We've all seen action
in this shit.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.141
How long have you guys
been here?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.621
We were barely
out of basic training

08:11.665 --> 08:13.797
when the rising happened.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.321
Our company was stationed here.

08:16.365 --> 08:20.935
A few months back it was-
it was a safe place.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.937
We had everything we needed.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.765
Food, supplies.

08:24.808 --> 08:28.246
And then suddenly
it all changed.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.990
We don't know how
they got in.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.384
It spread so fast.

08:35.427 --> 08:38.561
If the city was overrun
why are you guys still here?

08:38.605 --> 08:40.607
Leave no man behind.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.434
We were doing regular sweeps
during the day

08:42.478 --> 08:45.525
trying to find survivors and
then we lost communication

08:45.568 --> 08:49.093
with our patrol and now
we're doing sweeps

08:49.137 --> 08:51.443
hoping to find them.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.968
We hear a lot of stories
about you.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.796
Are you here to save us?

08:55.839 --> 08:59.495
I don't know what you've heard
but I'm no saviour.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.978
We saw you heal
so it's all true.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.067
We're here on other business.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.330
Maybe we can help you?

09:08.373 --> 09:09.461
We have our own mission.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.114
What-

09:10.158 --> 09:11.551
That's an order.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.684
He's right.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.124
Let me talk to them for a sec.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.304
They're just kids.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.784
I know.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.917
We can't leave them here.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.136
They can't come with us.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.008
So why don't you go with them?

09:34.051 --> 09:36.227
Go help them find their friends.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.272
Say what?

09:37.315 --> 09:40.101
I know that's what you wanna do.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.712
We'll go kill the elder and you
go help them find their friends

09:42.756 --> 09:46.020
and we'll meet for drinks after.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.325
That is not happening.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.589
Axel, she's right.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.113
They need you so much more
than we do.

09:54.376 --> 09:58.075
Your mission to protect me
is over.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.295
End of discussion.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.130
Ok guys.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.611
Here's the deal.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.178
We're gonna leave Axel with you

10:14.222 --> 10:17.617
He's gonna help you track down
the rest of your squad.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
We can't promise...

10:28.453 --> 10:30.673
Home sweet home.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.632
It's not so bad.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.462
Not so good, either.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.986
Right.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.770
Beats a leaky triage.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.163
You know, I was lying
in bed wondering

10:42.206 --> 10:44.208
if that stupid airplane was
gonna fall on my head.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.340
Yeah, me too.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.603
I would- oh, the rats.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.171
Oh my god, they
were big as dogs.

10:55.785 --> 10:56.743
One bed?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.788
Yeah. Looks like it.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.100
Um, I'll take the couch.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.015
No, no, god no.
You sure?

11:08.058 --> 11:09.494
Oh yeah.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.454
Home sweet home.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.804
Right.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.332
Yeah. Home sweet home.

11:34.476 --> 11:38.132
I gotta admit it feels pretty
good to be back in uniform.

11:38.175 --> 11:41.701
Don't go getting yourself killed
trying to save the world.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.181
Saving the world is your job.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.623
You be careful out there.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.713
Yeah, back at you, army man.

11:54.757 --> 11:55.845
Marine.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.326
Yeah, whatever.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.024
I gotta say you do look
damn good in that uniform.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.678
Oh yeah?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.636
You look pretty good
in yours, too.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.421
I know.

12:14.646 --> 12:18.781
Regulators, let's man up.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.652
[laughs]

12:20.696 --> 12:23.133
Always wanted to say that.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.514
Hey, Flesh?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.038
What is this thing?

13:00.867 --> 13:02.346
Flesh?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.135
Flesh, you ok?

13:08.178 --> 13:10.137
I'm not sleeping in there.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.181
Yeah, sure.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.314
You- you can take that room.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.447
Are you alright?

13:16.491 --> 13:17.535
You're so stupid.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.841
You're the last person
in the world

13:18.885 --> 13:21.670
that I wanna be
spending time with.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.237
I'm sorry, Flesh.
I just wanna-

13:23.280 --> 13:24.542
Don't call me that!

13:24.586 --> 13:26.153
Just stop calling me that,
alright?!

13:26.196 --> 13:28.372
That's- that's the name that
you gave me after you turned me.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.332
I'm not your boy anymore.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.290
My name's Phil.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.989
Phil Fleichman.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.432
You're Phil.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.000
Phil Fleichman.

14:16.768 --> 14:17.857
I hope Axel's alright.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.728
Those soldiers seemed
pretty rattled.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.426
Can't have any distractions
when we fight the B'ah.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.864
Who's distracted?

14:24.907 --> 14:27.779
I need you to stay focused.

14:27.823 --> 14:31.871
Forgive me for giving a shit
about somebody.

14:31.914 --> 14:35.178
Look, when I was searching
for Dylan

14:35.222 --> 14:38.007
my decisions were clouded
by my love for her

14:38.051 --> 14:40.270
and I don't want that to happen
to you.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.271
Love?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.577
Ok, you can relax on the L-word.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.752
We hooked up, ok?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.972
One time.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.234
You know what I mean.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.409
I actually don't know
what you mean

14:48.452 --> 14:50.193
because you never
talk about her.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.803
I wouldn't have even known
Dylan existed

14:51.847 --> 14:53.588
if someone else hadn't
have brought her up.

14:53.631 --> 14:58.898
Come on, tell me,
what was she like?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.377
[sighs]

15:00.421 --> 15:04.468
Come on, she was my family, too.

15:04.512 --> 15:08.472
She was beautiful.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.388
So smart.

15:11.432 --> 15:16.089
Kind.

15:16.132 --> 15:19.962
She had this laugh.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.269
I really wish I could have
met her.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.923
Me too.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.578
[rattling]

15:28.275 --> 15:29.102
You see that?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.973
Yeah, what is that?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.978
You think we can trust him?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.546
I barely trust you
and you're my sister.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.243
That's fair.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.728
Shit.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.256
Cute pyjamas.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.171
I fought vampires like these
in China.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.000
They're nothing like you've
encountered before.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.088
Alright.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.133
They're still gonna die
by my blade.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.004
That's all I care about.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.102
That is new.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.234
Keep your eyes on them.
They're quick.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.018
Yeah, well so am I.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.715
Let's dance.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.152
[gun shots]

16:21.371 --> 16:23.983
[gun shots]

16:38.084 --> 16:40.303
[fighting grunts]

17:45.629 --> 17:46.848
I had that.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.332
My turn.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.884
Bitch!

18:26.931 --> 18:29.456
[grunting]

18:40.989 --> 18:43.426
He's just been buried!

18:43.470 --> 18:44.993
Aaargh!!!!

18:46.734 --> 18:47.778
Who are you?

18:47.822 --> 18:50.694
I am the Burier!

18:50.738 --> 18:52.870
Aaargh!!!!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.745
But you can call me Barry.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.186
[Dre] There's a group of us
holed up down the road.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.666
We were out on a supply salvage

19:05.709 --> 19:07.058
when those things
cornered us.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.712
[Scarlett] How many of you
are there?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.453
[Dre] 14.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.413
Used to be a lot more but littl by little we got picked off.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.023
[Vanessa]: You in charge?

19:15.066 --> 19:16.938
[Dre] In charge of what?

19:16.981 --> 19:19.723
The closest thing we got
to leadership is Mary Beth.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.682
But it ain't like any of us
is trained in dealing

19:21.725 --> 19:23.336
with this shit.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.294
What're you doing here,
anyway?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.556
Looking for a vampire.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.123
To kill it.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.213
You actually came here
looking for a fight?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.259
I don't know if that's brave
or crazy.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.435
Pretty much both.

19:37.654 --> 19:38.699
Are you ok?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.135
Yeah.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.011
[ding]

19:48.404 --> 19:49.884
[screaming]

19:49.927 --> 19:51.668
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

19:51.712 --> 19:53.061
Get off of me!

19:58.632 --> 20:00.242
Get off of me!

20:02.679 --> 20:04.115
[clears throat]

20:05.247 --> 20:09.425
You gotta stop doing that.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.253
They're gonna find out
I'm not really a nurse.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.646
Not unless you tell them.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.083
Besides, you were more or less
a nurse at triage.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.128
A labradoodle could have been
a nurse at triage.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.130
Holding people down
during amputations

20:19.174 --> 20:21.132
and standing guard during...

20:21.176 --> 20:23.657
night watch wasn't exactly
medical training.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.962
Ok, just be cool.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.181
Sarah and Jolene?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.443
Yes. Sarah.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.052
Jolene.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.358
Come with me.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.925
We obviously have no way
of checking credentials

20:30.968 --> 20:32.492
so we pretty much go
with your word.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.363
We're always looking for people
with hospital experience.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.539
Basically you kill someone
and you're fired.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.192
Got it.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.019
Don't kill anyone.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.020
You say you were an RN?

20:39.063 --> 20:40.674
Yes, I was.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.806
What's the most effective way to
measure a patient's temperature?

20:42.850 --> 20:45.548
Um, it's uh... rectally.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.158
Good enough.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.682
Dr. Carol, it says here you have
a background in hematology?

20:48.725 --> 20:50.336
Yes, that was my main focus.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.294
You'll find here you'll be
bouncing around a lot,

20:52.338 --> 20:54.427
everyone kinda needs to be a
jack of all trades at times.

20:54.470 --> 20:55.645
I hope you're ok with that?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.473
Yes, as long as I have access
to a lab.

20:57.517 --> 20:58.779
Yeah, there's one
one level down.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.216
It's not top of the line
but it's good enough.

21:01.912 --> 21:02.739
Brown outs.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.045
Happens all the time.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.264
With the influx of new people

21:05.307 --> 21:07.004
our grid hasn't been able
to handle it.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.006
Welcome to the work force.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.705
That was easier
than medical school.

21:11.748 --> 21:12.836
Come on.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.796
Oh, come on.
You know you wanna.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.928
[laughs]

21:25.588 --> 21:27.155
This is it.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.812
If you wanna just hang back
for a minute,

21:31.855 --> 21:33.640
I'm gonna go grab Mary Beth.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.256
Put this with the rest of them.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.781
Mary Beth?

21:46.783 --> 21:48.655
[whispering]

21:49.308 --> 21:50.439
Hello.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.658
Who's this?

21:51.701 --> 21:53.747
This is Vanessa and her sister,
Charlotte.

21:53.790 --> 21:54.791
Scarlett.

21:54.835 --> 21:55.531
Apologies.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.706
Scarlett.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.099
It's a pleasure.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.579
They saved us.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.755
Well, thank you for that.

22:01.798 --> 22:04.061
And then I saved them.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.976
Well done, Barry.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.369
Dre says you're the one
in charge.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.718
Hardly.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.503
I was the weather anchor
before this,

22:10.546 --> 22:12.548
Channel 5 News.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.421
Things fell apart about
three weeks back.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.813
I don't know.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.207
I guess because people
recognize me from TV they-

22:19.250 --> 22:22.515
they look to me for leadership.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.691
We're doing the best we can.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.910
Figured you guys could use this.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.434
Thanks.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.392
So what brings you
to San Francisco?

22:30.436 --> 22:33.961
Most people avoid the coast
in search of higher ground.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.354
We're looking for a vampire.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.573
We've got lots of those lately.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.880
What happened out here?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.838
Everything was fine
for a while.

22:41.882 --> 22:45.364
The military, what was left
of it at least,

22:45.407 --> 22:48.671
they were creating a safe zone
down around Fisherman's Wharf.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.892
The plan was to secure
San Francisco, Oakland next.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.111
I'd have believed
that when I saw it.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.418
And then they just appeared.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.202
Yeah, those vampires.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.030
The flippy ones.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.771
They came out of nowhere.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.686
Military couldn't do
a goddamn thing.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.906
Dozens of people were wiped out.

23:05.949 --> 23:09.388
They were already inside
the perimeter somehow.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.912
You said this started
about three weeks ago?

23:18.353 --> 23:20.442
I think that the elder
tricked me.

23:20.486 --> 23:25.099
When it sent me to China it knew
that the B'ah would be awoken.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.797
The elder couldn't kill us
but the B'ah could.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.712
You can't blame yourself
for that.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.888
You couldn't have known.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.716
Maybe.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.460
You look like shit.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.201
Thank you very much.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.332
That's really nice.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.551
Oh!

23:42.595 --> 23:43.639
Help me out.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.162
Put her down.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.557
What's wrong with her?

23:53.344 --> 23:55.521
Oh my god, what is that?

24:01.831 --> 24:03.311
She's been poisoned.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.747
Is it bad?

24:06.532 --> 24:08.490
If I don't find the vampire
who did this to her

24:08.534 --> 24:10.187
and feed her its blood,
she'll die.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.581
Yeah, that's bad.

24:12.625 --> 24:16.498
You said the vampires were
already inside the perimeter?

24:16.542 --> 24:18.457
Do you know where
the attacks originated?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.936
A warehouse down by the docks.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.808
Barry worked the wharf.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.332
Can you take me there?

24:24.375 --> 24:25.899
You bet.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.817
Go get that kit.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.820
Ok, I'm here. It's ok.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.049
These stairs are starting
to make me feel dizzy.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.530
I mean, how many basements
can be in one building, anyway?

24:48.574 --> 24:49.749
I thought you said
you worked here.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.839
I did, as a busker,
not a longshoreman.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.275
I mean, why couldn't we be
in a building

24:54.318 --> 24:57.713
with a working elevator, huh?

24:57.757 --> 25:00.324
Maybe let's not announce
our arrival.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.937
Wait up for me.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.637
It's pretty simple, really.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.857
Everything comes pre-packaged
from the company.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.554
You've given flu shots before,
right?

25:12.598 --> 25:15.209
Of course.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.602
Uh, but, you know what?

25:16.645 --> 25:18.517
It's... it's been so long.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.649
Why don't you show me
how you do it?

25:20.693 --> 25:22.782
Sure.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.219
Have you had your
first shot yet?

25:25.262 --> 25:26.612
It's mandatory, you know.

25:26.655 --> 25:27.787
Nope.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.528
Let me pop your cherry then.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.355
So to speak.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.274
Uh, what is it, exactly?

25:37.318 --> 25:40.103
It's uh, it's a repellant
for vampires.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.757
Oh.

25:41.801 --> 25:45.848
What, like um...
vampire deet?

25:45.892 --> 25:48.416
Yeah, pretty much.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.332
So first you just gently tap
the syringe,

25:51.375 --> 25:54.161
get all the little bubbles out.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.424
Then you wanna stick it
in the upper arm.

25:58.644 --> 26:02.343
Push the plunger like that.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.520
Dispose of it in
the yellow containers,

26:05.564 --> 26:07.130
and that's that.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.393
And so on and so on.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.395
Any questions?

26:11.439 --> 26:12.396
Nope.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.621
I've seen you before.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.666
I doubt it.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.798
Nah, I'm pretty good
with faces.

26:22.842 --> 26:26.193
Names I can't remember for shit
but faces, I...

26:26.236 --> 26:27.716
was it in Seattle?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.762
That's where I'm from,
originally.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.767
You uh, do you wanna get
a drink later?

26:34.810 --> 26:39.467
Oh, I don't know.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.513
I don't know if my girlfriend
would like that.

26:43.210 --> 26:46.082
Girlfriend.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.649
Oh.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.346
Cool. Yeah.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.437
Girlfriend.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.625
Oh, this'll do.

27:10.019 --> 27:13.588
This'll do just fine.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.242
Oh yeah.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.907
Let's see what you're all about.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.160
There, there.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.901
Come on now.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.034
You gotta hang in there.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.819
Come on.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.429
You gotta hang in there.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.736
You gotta hang in there.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.438
Woah, don't worry, you're safe.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.309
You're safe.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.745
What's wrong with me?

28:23.789 --> 28:26.879
You've been bitten
by one of those things.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.619
Where is everybody?

28:28.663 --> 28:30.230
Where's Vanessa?

28:30.273 --> 28:32.406
She went after that vampire
you're looking for.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.363
What, the B'ah?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.060
Mmmhmm.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.365
No, no, no, no, no.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.411
It's gonna kill her on her own.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.281
No, I need to help her.

28:38.325 --> 28:38.978
Hey, easy.

28:39.021 --> 28:39.500
I need to help her!

28:39.543 --> 28:40.631
Easy, easy!

28:40.675 --> 28:41.371
Come here.

28:41.415 --> 28:41.894
Come here.

28:41.937 --> 28:42.590
Get off.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.504
No, no, no, no, no.

28:43.547 --> 28:44.984
What you gotta do is come here.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.028
Easy.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.336
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.859
What you need to do now
is stay put.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.121
That's what you need to do.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.035
Where's Axel?

28:53.079 --> 28:54.123
Axel? Uh...

28:54.167 --> 28:55.124
Is he with Vanessa?

28:55.168 --> 28:55.951
Yeah.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.344
Is he helping her?

28:57.387 --> 28:59.302
He's with Vanessa,
they're meeting up right now,

28:59.346 --> 29:02.131
and everything's gonna be ok.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.655
Shh. There you go.

29:04.699 --> 29:05.874
That's good. Take it easy.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.658
Take it easy.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.057
That's it, that's it, that's it.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.277
Everything's gonna be ok.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.887
There you go.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.889
There you go.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.989
This is like searching
for a needle in a haystack.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.258
I think we may have found
our needle.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.012
I've seen these crates before.

29:57.056 --> 30:00.146
She must have been here waiting
this whole time.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.931
And she wasn't alone.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.290
Does this feel weird to you?

30:14.334 --> 30:15.335
Mmm.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.773
It's definitely weird.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.383
But it's good weird, you know?

30:20.427 --> 30:24.866
Like... slightly close
to normal.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.042
Like, I don't know whether
to run and hide

30:27.086 --> 30:28.652
or jump up and down for joy.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.003
[laughs]

30:31.046 --> 30:32.091
Yeah.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.615
Well, thanks for bringing
me lunch.

30:34.658 --> 30:37.313
It was, um, super sweet of you.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.575
Beats burned rodent.

30:38.619 --> 30:40.142
Oh, but I so love burned rodent.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.883
[laughs]

30:41.927 --> 30:43.798
Shit.

30:44.973 --> 30:48.498
So um, first day at work,
how did it go?

30:48.542 --> 30:50.718
Oh, right, first day.

30:50.761 --> 30:55.549
Ok, um, well, my new coworker is
a super creepy guy named Jared.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.029
Ah.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.379
So nothing has changed, ok.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.859
He asked me out.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.773
Where are you going?

31:02.817 --> 31:04.863
Very funny.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.299
I told him I had a girlfriend.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.475
You should have seen the look
on his face.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.303
It was awesome.

31:11.826 --> 31:14.002
Girlfriend.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.134
It just came out.

31:15.177 --> 31:18.920
It was just, you know,
in the moment.

31:18.964 --> 31:23.055
Back off, Jared.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.448
It just came out.

31:28.799 --> 31:32.716
I like you, Sarah.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.458
I wanna be honest about it.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.680
I like you, too.

31:41.856 --> 31:46.861
[laughs]

32:17.979 --> 32:21.417
[yelling indistinctly]

32:27.380 --> 32:28.729
Seems like people's fuses
are getting shorter

32:28.772 --> 32:30.513
and shorter around here.

32:30.557 --> 32:31.384
You look lost.

32:31.427 --> 32:32.341
You need something?

32:32.385 --> 32:33.690
Yeah, I'm looking for work.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.866
Are you hiring?

32:35.910 --> 32:37.912
You look the part.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.914
Hopefully the part you like.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.003
You'll know if it is.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.005
You're not from around here.
I haven't seen you before.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.965
No, this is my first day
in Denver.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.923
How's bussing
and bouncing sound?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.620
That sounds great.

32:50.664 --> 32:51.665
Perfect.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.058
I'm Frankie.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.189
I'm Julius.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.625
Welcome aboard, Julius.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.410
Come on, I'll show you around.

33:06.897 --> 33:11.685
So Axel, what was it like
serving overseas?

33:11.728 --> 33:13.948
It was sandy.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.645
And hot.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.734
Raskin, now's not the time.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.562
I'm curious.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.738
What it was like.

33:21.782 --> 33:22.913
War is hell, kid.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.829
Ain't nothing sexy about it.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.744
You know what it's like,

33:27.788 --> 33:31.096
hold your buddy's hand while
he takes his last breath,

33:31.139 --> 33:34.925
tell him everything's gonna
be fine when you know it's not.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.711
But it wasn't
like killing vamps.

33:37.754 --> 33:41.541
Yeah, well, vamps, at least
you know they're bad guys.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.022
Over there there
are no bad guys,

33:44.065 --> 33:45.806
just different points of view.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.550
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.291
Patterson, you're with me.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.293
Raskin, get our six.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.470
Mendoza, keep it running
in case we need to bug out.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.497
Hell of a fire fight here.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.072
This is recent.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.164
Whatever got 'em didn't kill
'em, it took 'em.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.430
We gotta find 'em.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.258
We will.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.662
[door opens]

34:59.706 --> 35:02.926
[exhales]

35:04.972 --> 35:06.147
Hey.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.366
Jolene.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.802
What're you doing here?

35:08.845 --> 35:11.065
I thought you could use this.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.806
Can you believe it?

35:12.849 --> 35:15.243
Coffee.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.288
Hmm?

35:18.203 --> 35:19.813
Thanks.

35:22.424 --> 35:24.774
Is everything ok?

35:24.818 --> 35:25.862
Yep.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.908
I'm just busy.

35:30.911 --> 35:37.222
Was it what happened uh...
at lunch?

35:37.265 --> 35:39.354
What?

35:39.398 --> 35:41.051
Oh, that?

35:41.095 --> 35:42.140
No.

35:42.183 --> 35:45.230
'Cause uh, we're just
kinda living

35:45.273 --> 35:47.449
in a dangerous time, right?

35:47.493 --> 35:50.191
And uh, tomorrow isn't
a guarantee

35:50.235 --> 35:53.629
and I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.370
Look, if you're not interested,
I understand.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.154
It's-

35:56.197 --> 35:57.416
No, it's not that.

35:57.459 --> 35:58.591
Well, you kissed me back.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.680
I know.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.944
I'm just... I'm really confused.

36:03.987 --> 36:04.858
It was too soon.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.034
No.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.949
Maybe.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.037
I don't know.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.082
What's going on?

36:12.126 --> 36:14.650
Just be honest with me.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.088
I have a lot of work to do.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.701
Yeah.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.795
Fine.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.799
Go ahead and shut
the door on me, too.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.497
I guess it's what you're
good at.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.717
Oh.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.435
Where are you going?

37:00.479 --> 37:02.350
Oh, you aren't ready for this,
and I totally understand,

37:02.394 --> 37:04.178
it's my fault for pushing things
too fast.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.440
No, you don't have to do this.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.441
Yes, I do.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.355
No, you don't.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.356
I don't want you to go.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.402
Then give me a reason to stay.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.099
Exactly my point.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.494
I'm a virgin.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.105
Pardon?

37:19.498 --> 37:20.499
Really?

37:22.588 --> 37:25.417
Oh, you mean like with women?

37:28.811 --> 37:30.944
Oh.

37:30.987 --> 37:31.901
Oh my god.

37:31.945 --> 37:32.685
No.

37:32.728 --> 37:33.729
Oh my god.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.470
No, no, no, no, no.
It's ok. It's-

37:35.514 --> 37:36.166
Oh my god.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.559
It's not a big deal.

37:37.603 --> 37:38.865
It's super rare, but
it's not a big deal at all,

37:38.908 --> 37:41.128
it's- it's nothing
to be ashamed of, it's...

37:41.171 --> 37:42.303
It's so embarrassing.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.391
No.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.088
Oh my god, I'm a freak
of nature.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.308
No, you're not a freak
of nature.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.005
Oh my god.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.444
Ok. Ok. Ok.

37:52.487 --> 37:53.793
You know what?

37:53.836 --> 37:57.318
I never connected
with anyone ever,

37:57.362 --> 38:01.888
so all of this
that I'm feeling...

38:01.931 --> 38:03.759
I am scared shitless.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.413
You scare me.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.374
And you're right, I push
people away, ok?

38:09.417 --> 38:10.984
I'm not proud of that.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.942
But I have never met anyone
that makes me feel

38:12.986 --> 38:15.336
the way how you do and I don't
know what to do with that

38:15.380 --> 38:18.861
except ask you to stay
so please don't go.

38:22.996 --> 38:28.393
I didn't wanna make
you feel anything but happy.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.743
And we can just take it slow.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.404
We can take it as slow
as you like.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.016
Ok.

38:44.626 --> 38:45.932
I'm so sorry.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.158
I'm sorry.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.290
No.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.030
I'm sorry.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.119
It's ok.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.962
Hands on a swivel, boys.

39:31.630 --> 39:32.631
[doors close]

39:43.511 --> 39:45.165
Oh shit.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.514
Those are our guys.

39:48.734 --> 39:49.865
Adams.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.606
Johnson.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.260
What the hell could do
that to them?

39:53.303 --> 39:54.566
An elder.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.829
What's an elder?

39:56.872 --> 39:58.352
You don't wanna know.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.441
Worse the ferals?

40:00.485 --> 40:03.662
Worse than an army of ferals
set on fire.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.272
Oh shit.

40:05.315 --> 40:08.971
It's like when it took their
blood it took their souls, too.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.582
I don't wanna meet this thing.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.236
Yeah, well let's not press
our luck.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.021
Fall back.

40:15.064 --> 40:15.848
[swoosh sound]

40:15.891 --> 40:17.197
What was that?

40:24.509 --> 40:25.684
Steady, boys.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.468
Stick together.

40:27.512 --> 40:28.426
What is that?

40:28.469 --> 40:29.862
What's happening?

40:29.905 --> 40:30.732
We gotta get outta here, now.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.168
Go! Go!

40:34.519 --> 40:35.041
Back to back.

40:35.084 --> 40:35.781
Back to back!

40:35.824 --> 40:37.522
Don't break formation.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.350
Jesus Christ.

40:47.749 --> 40:50.404
There's gotta be a faster way
to do this.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.450
Ok, um...

40:52.493 --> 40:53.886
Break it down
into sectors.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.017
Alright.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.762
How's she doing?

41:00.806 --> 41:03.809
She's strong, but I'm not sure
how much longer she can fight.

41:30.662 --> 41:31.880
Hey.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.318
Hang in there, sis.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.625
We're gonna fix this.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.372
Where the hell are you, Axel?

41:50.595 --> 41:51.552
[gun fire]

41:51.596 --> 41:53.032
Go! Go!

41:53.511 --> 41:54.033
[gun fire]

41:54.076 --> 41:55.643
Stick together!

41:55.687 --> 41:58.559
[gun fire]

41:58.603 --> 42:00.518
Get down! Get down!

42:03.042 --> 42:04.739
Stay away from the shadow!

42:04.783 --> 42:08.134
[gunfire]

42:08.177 --> 42:10.702
Man down! Man down!

42:10.745 --> 42:15.924
[gunfire]

42:23.845 --> 42:25.804
Goddamn apocalypse.
