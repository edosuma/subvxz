01:22.270 --> 01:24.227
The show must go on

01:24.397 --> 01:26.436
The show must go on

01:26.607 --> 01:30.735
To answer all the clamour
For oomph and glamour and so on

01:30.903 --> 01:35.529
To captivate Tom, Dick and Harry
Each Matilda, Kay and Carrie

01:35.699 --> 01:39.567
Cleopatra and DuBarry
Puts her show on

01:39.745 --> 01:43.908
Way back in history
Old Adam didn't give a care

01:44.082 --> 01:48.411
There was no mystery
A rag, a bone, a hank of hair

01:48.587 --> 01:52.714
But since humanity
Discovered vanity

01:52.882 --> 01:56.832
We only know the show must go on

02:01.515 --> 02:06.806
We only know the show must go on

02:06.979 --> 02:12.602
This clever lyrical endeav our
Could probably go on forever

02:12.776 --> 02:16.524
But all we're saying is what you know

02:16.697 --> 02:20.694
That glamour is a woman's show

02:20.867 --> 02:23.702
The show most people lik e to view

02:23.870 --> 02:28.081
Is evident in burlesque

02:28.249 --> 02:30.538
That show must go on

02:30.710 --> 02:32.204
The show must go on

02:32.378 --> 02:33.837
The show must go on

02:34.005 --> 02:37.005
To answer all the clamour
For oomph and glamour and so on

02:37.174 --> 02:40.175
But since humanity
Discovered vanity

02:40.344 --> 02:44.591
We only know the show must go on

02:44.765 --> 02:48.976
But the show we show
Is different because

02:49.144 --> 02:53.521
We don't depend on this
Nor this for applause

02:54.232 --> 02:59.060
That sort of thing
We scornfully dismiss

02:59.237 --> 03:02.072
For

03:02.240 --> 03:04.031
This

03:40.109 --> 03:45.648
We only know the show must go on!

03:48.283 --> 03:49.908
Hey, Genius!

03:50.118 --> 03:51.778
Coming.

03:55.498 --> 03:58.701
Oh, those poor people.

03:59.544 --> 04:02.117
The entertainment can start.
The Genius is here.

04:02.296 --> 04:07.172
Don't let the customers hear. The house
can be emptied in three minutes.

04:07.885 --> 04:09.593
Listen, kids.

04:10.805 --> 04:14.932
That number's still ragged. On your
entrance, keep your heads down.

04:15.100 --> 04:19.264
- Our mothers told us not to do it.
- You can't teach old daughters new tricks.

04:19.605 --> 04:22.392
We'll see if I can
at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

04:22.816 --> 04:24.061
Rehearsals are at 10.

04:24.276 --> 04:28.024
Go on, you got five minutes
to make your change.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.654
Those little dames can sure gripe.

04:30.823 --> 04:33.149
The bigger the gripe,
the better the army, Jim.

04:33.326 --> 04:36.030
- And there is a great army.
- You're not kidding.

04:36.245 --> 04:37.823
Well, I just won't show up.

04:37.997 --> 04:40.570
I have an appointment at 9:00,
and I'll keep it.

04:40.750 --> 04:43.869
It's my chance to get out of here
and into the big time.

04:44.044 --> 04:47.876
- What big time?
- The big time has nothing to do with 9:00.

04:48.048 --> 04:50.965
- You got a line on a job, Maurine?
- You bet I have.

04:51.134 --> 04:53.708
It has nothing to do with 9:00 either,
or 10:00.

04:53.887 --> 04:55.465
You can sleep all day.

04:55.680 --> 05:00.591
- I've never heard of a job like that.
- No? Here, look for yourself.

05:00.768 --> 05:04.137
Not that I think I'm the most
beautiful girl in the world...

05:04.314 --> 05:06.187
but I think I can at least try.

05:06.399 --> 05:09.768
"Vanity's Golden Wedding Girl.
Fame and fortune await the girl...

05:09.944 --> 05:12.980
on the cover
of Vanity's 50th anniversary number.

05:13.155 --> 05:16.524
Who will she be? She could be you."

05:16.700 --> 05:20.401
How could getting your face on
a magazine get you into the big time?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.909
A cover girl's face can unlock
any door.

05:23.081 --> 05:25.833
- I've got a face. I'll use it.
- I don't understand.

05:26.001 --> 05:28.955
If you can do better,
why should Mr. McGuire object?

05:29.170 --> 05:32.456
The McGuire slogan is to get there
on your feet, not your face.

05:32.882 --> 05:36.298
Can you imagine me asking him?

06:14.380 --> 06:18.329
My name is Rusty Parker.

06:21.136 --> 06:22.880
Parker.

06:23.055 --> 06:26.922
Could I see Mr. Coudair
about the Vanity cover?

06:27.100 --> 06:31.596
Miss Jackson, Mr. Coudair's assistant,
does interviews. She'll try to see you.

06:31.771 --> 06:33.728
Thank you.

06:51.165 --> 06:53.157
What on earth are you doing here?

06:53.333 --> 06:56.120
Oh, same thing you are, I guess.

06:56.295 --> 06:58.287
You shouldn't be
such a good salesman.

06:58.463 --> 07:01.001
Does Danny know you came?

07:01.174 --> 07:04.045
Well, I didn't tell him,
if that's what you mean.

07:04.219 --> 07:06.840
He's gonna be sore at me. But you...

07:07.013 --> 07:09.338
egads, he'll cut you up
in little pieces.

07:09.515 --> 07:11.638
Well, he doesn't have to know.

07:11.809 --> 07:13.434
Does he, Maurine?

07:13.603 --> 07:15.262
No, of course not.

07:17.148 --> 07:20.232
Save it, kitties. Don't waste it on me.

07:20.776 --> 07:23.646
That redhead isn't bad.

07:23.821 --> 07:24.983
No, she isn't.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.195
All right, Marion, let the bars down.

07:27.366 --> 07:29.939
Carry on, Colby.

07:31.411 --> 07:32.691
Maurine Martin, please.

07:33.955 --> 07:37.787
Egads, wish me luck.

07:41.004 --> 07:43.210
That girl has a really lovely figure...

07:43.381 --> 07:44.875
if she knew how to walk.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.419
Ever done any modelling?

07:46.592 --> 07:49.509
No, but all you have to do is keep still,
isn't it?

07:49.678 --> 07:50.841
That always helps.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.423
Does it matter I've never modelled?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.633
No, in this case, we prefer it.

07:55.809 --> 08:00.186
Now sit down and stand up
again several times.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.696
I mean stand.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.111
You're a very pretty girl,
little on the brash side, however.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.451
Our girl has to be quiet and demure.
After all, the cover is a bride.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.665
Who's the girl with you,
the one with the red hair?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.247
Oh, she works in the same joint...

08:30.425 --> 08:32.750
I mean, the same nightclub
in Brooklyn I do.

08:32.928 --> 08:35.715
Danny McGuire's. Why?

08:35.972 --> 08:37.169
She's pretty.

08:37.349 --> 08:40.717
Now smile directly at me.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.352
And she looks relaxed.

08:42.520 --> 08:48.060
If only you gals could realise how
important it is to be quiet and relaxed.

08:53.697 --> 08:54.978
Nice teeth.

08:55.157 --> 08:58.740
Keep your nightlife down and
your hopes up. You may hear from us.

08:58.994 --> 09:01.401
Thank you.

09:03.623 --> 09:06.410
Goodbye.

09:08.086 --> 09:11.087
B.J. Graham.

09:12.131 --> 09:13.626
Are my seams straight?

09:13.800 --> 09:16.717
They're all right, darling.

09:18.512 --> 09:20.422
Don't make the mistakes I made.

09:20.598 --> 09:24.465
Keep talking and move around a lot.
Be animated.

09:24.643 --> 09:28.012
That's what they're after. Even if you
overdo it, be animated.

09:28.188 --> 09:31.272
Don't relax for a minute.
Don't let her know you're new.

09:31.441 --> 09:34.893
Say anything, but impress it on her
you've modelled before.

09:35.070 --> 09:38.320
- But I haven't.
- Rusty Parker.

09:39.366 --> 09:43.315
Don't forget. Be animated.

10:01.762 --> 10:04.134
Hello! How do you do?

10:06.683 --> 10:09.352
My name is Rusty Parker.
And you're Miss Jackson.

10:09.519 --> 10:11.179
I've heard so much about you.

10:11.354 --> 10:14.308
I suppose you've noticed
I'm so full of animation...

10:14.482 --> 10:16.640
it's impossible for me to sit still.

10:16.818 --> 10:20.233
My grandmother said it's because
my glands worked right.

10:20.446 --> 10:23.115
I suppose you'd like to know
about my experience.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.524
I've done so much,
all kinds of things.

10:25.701 --> 10:28.702
I've been on more bottles...
Cold cures are my specialty.

10:28.912 --> 10:32.162
You know, sneezes and animated stuff,
things like that.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.206
I have some photographs here...

10:34.376 --> 10:36.452
I'd rather you wouldn't take them out.

10:36.628 --> 10:39.249
I don't feel up to capturing them
if they get loose.

10:39.422 --> 10:42.922
I think there's something you can take.
I'd find out about it.

10:43.134 --> 10:44.676
Take? For what?

10:44.844 --> 10:49.305
Those glands. They're going to turn
on you one of these days.

10:52.852 --> 10:56.221
But why can't I be
the Golden Wedding Girl, Mr. Coudair?

10:56.439 --> 10:59.688
Your face is familiar to everyone
who picks up a magazine.

10:59.858 --> 11:03.025
- I want a new face.
- I don't blame you. So do I.

11:03.195 --> 11:07.691
What is a new face anyway? I hear
about them, but I've never seen one.

11:07.908 --> 11:09.485
All right, Mr. Coudair.

11:09.659 --> 11:15.413
But I don't know how a bride can be
new and experienced at the same time.

11:15.915 --> 11:18.750
- May I come in?
- It won't do you any good.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.163
Your face isn't new enough.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.542
Fine thing!

11:24.340 --> 11:28.040
I saw the Golden Wedding Dress.
It's a dream. Don't you love it?

11:28.219 --> 11:32.002
For now, there's nothing
about this contest I love. It's beautiful.

11:32.181 --> 11:35.217
If you got me a dress like that,
I'd marry anybody.

11:35.392 --> 11:39.520
Then I'll be very careful not to, Jinx.
We need you in our business.

11:39.688 --> 11:41.597
Stonewall, there's the layout.

11:41.773 --> 11:44.940
The dress is ready. There's
the deadline. Where's the face?

11:45.110 --> 11:48.561
I have brought you 10,000 batches
of photographs by slow count.

11:48.738 --> 11:52.107
Colby and I have been looking too.
You're very hard to please.

11:52.283 --> 11:55.866
- You don't know what you want.
- I know exactly what I want.

11:56.037 --> 12:00.579
- I want a girl with a story in her eyes.
- Drawing room or smoking room?

12:02.084 --> 12:05.868
What does a young girl think about
when she's going down the aisle?

12:06.046 --> 12:08.085
That's the look I want...

12:08.256 --> 12:10.249
that young, wondering, misty look.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.343
Well, now we have a clue, Jinx.
She must be misty.

12:13.553 --> 12:15.676
I can find you a lot of foggy ones.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.425
Thanks for helping us, Jinx.

12:18.266 --> 12:21.966
Somebody helped me to get started,
didn't they? Bye.

12:22.311 --> 12:24.019
John, I'm desperate.

12:24.188 --> 12:27.771
There isn't a thing that Harry Conover
hasn't made well-known...

12:27.942 --> 12:32.983
except this one. She's at least new.
We've got to choose somebody.

12:33.155 --> 12:36.987
Very pretty girl.
Let me go take a look at her.

12:37.201 --> 12:41.661
This mania you have for peering at
these creatures in their native haunts...

12:41.830 --> 12:44.866
I should know after all these
years I can't change you.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.497
Is this one worth going to Brooklyn
to see?

12:47.669 --> 12:49.792
Where on earth is that?

12:49.963 --> 12:53.296
I think you take a bridge to get there.

12:57.053 --> 12:59.378
- Evening, Pop.
- Oh, hello, girls.

12:59.555 --> 13:00.930
Hello, Danny.

13:01.098 --> 13:06.389
If you'd had a horse under you in North
Africa instead of one of them tanks...

13:06.562 --> 13:09.977
you wouldn't have got shot up
the way you was and sent home.

13:10.148 --> 13:11.892
Where'd it get you, Danny?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.858
In Libya.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.944
Well, it don't show a bit.

13:17.906 --> 13:20.231
- Evening, Pop.
- Cold out, ain't it, Rusty?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.199
Sure is.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.277
Hi, chicken.

13:24.454 --> 13:26.861
Hello, Danny.

13:27.707 --> 13:31.574
Missed you for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. Don't you eat anymore?

13:31.752 --> 13:34.919
- I wasn't hungry tonight.
- Weren't you hungry this morning?

13:35.089 --> 13:39.086
Who stole my nylons? Egads, a very...

13:39.259 --> 13:42.213
- Not very.
- Too much rehearsal last night, huh?

13:42.387 --> 13:45.258
- It was kind of a workout.
- That why you slept late?

13:45.432 --> 13:47.839
Oh, I didn't sleep late. I went uptown.

13:48.018 --> 13:49.049
Shopping?

13:49.269 --> 13:53.598
No, I went to see a man...

13:53.773 --> 13:54.852
about a face.

13:55.024 --> 13:57.562
I thought you went to buy me
a wedding present.

13:57.735 --> 13:59.644
Why? You getting married?

13:59.820 --> 14:01.196
Didn't you hear?

14:01.364 --> 14:03.071
Why, no, Mr. McGuire.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.865
And who is the lucky girl?

14:05.034 --> 14:10.538
She's kind of a funny kid. She's sore
because she's got diamonds in her feet.

14:10.706 --> 14:12.994
Can you imagine that?

14:13.208 --> 14:17.288
Rusty, not many people have
diamonds in their feet.

14:18.171 --> 14:21.955
They threw me out, Danny.
They didn't want me up there.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.007
They didn't like my face.

14:24.844 --> 14:29.257
You've got a beautiful face. Is it your
worry they don't know their business?

14:29.432 --> 14:31.009
Well, I get so tired, Danny.

14:31.183 --> 14:34.683
This way, it takes so long
before you get anywhere.

14:34.854 --> 14:37.309
If you can get there quicker,
why shouldn't you?

14:37.481 --> 14:39.972
When you get there quick,
you're out quick.

14:40.150 --> 14:42.606
Easy get, easy lose.
I've never seen it fail.

14:42.778 --> 14:44.687
You gotta work for what you get.

14:44.863 --> 14:51.197
You're gonna be a star, but you gotta
get there on your feet, not your face.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.363
Old shortcut Susie.

14:54.539 --> 14:58.038
Old hard way McGuire.

14:58.209 --> 15:00.118
We're a fine pair.

15:00.294 --> 15:02.832
We're a wonderful pair.

15:03.005 --> 15:06.339
Aren't we though?

15:10.179 --> 15:13.761
Dally, dally, dally. Nothing around here
all day but dilly-dally.

15:13.932 --> 15:15.095
I better get dressed.

15:15.267 --> 15:18.268
I said it 100 times.
You don't get there on the steps.

15:18.437 --> 15:21.686
You get there on your...
But it depends on what you're after.

15:21.856 --> 15:25.023
Day and night, night and day,
all I do is work and slave...

15:25.193 --> 15:27.862
to keep this place
with its head underwater.

15:28.029 --> 15:30.235
My number comes up,
it goes to pieces.

15:30.406 --> 15:35.862
People sitting on the steps, chef quitting,
noisy kitchen, girls always gabbing.

15:36.037 --> 15:37.780
- I'm not complaining.
- You're on.

15:37.955 --> 15:40.197
Coming!

15:43.710 --> 15:45.620
My butcher shop My grocery

15:45.796 --> 15:47.919
Can k eep on saying no, sirree

15:48.090 --> 15:50.129
But lack of this Or that

15:50.300 --> 15:52.339
Doesn't knock me flat

15:52.510 --> 15:54.170
Foreign times lik e these

15:54.346 --> 15:56.421
Life's no life of these

15:56.598 --> 15:58.590
Although I'm no saint

15:58.766 --> 16:00.842
I have no complaint

16:01.018 --> 16:02.810
We must do that task

16:02.979 --> 16:04.852
And it's little enough

16:05.022 --> 16:07.430
They ask:

16:07.608 --> 16:09.565
"Who's Complaining?"

16:09.735 --> 16:11.609
I'm not complaining

16:11.779 --> 16:15.728
You'll see
We'll see this thing through

16:15.908 --> 16:20.071
Because of Axis' trick ery
My coffee now is chicory

16:20.245 --> 16:24.658
And I can rarely purloin
A sirloin

16:24.833 --> 16:26.659
No complaining

16:26.835 --> 16:28.626
Through the campaigning

16:28.795 --> 16:32.709
Who cares if carrots are few

16:32.882 --> 16:35.551
I'll feed myself on artichok es

16:35.718 --> 16:39.051
Until that Nazi Party chok es

16:39.221 --> 16:41.297
So long as they don't ration

16:41.473 --> 16:44.676
My passion For you

16:48.355 --> 16:51.272
You know if things go on
At the rate they're going

16:51.441 --> 16:54.312
And goods flow out
At the rate they're flowing

16:54.486 --> 17:00.405
The time isn't very far away
When this will be my typical day

17:00.575 --> 17:06.198
At breakfast time just after I get up
If there's little on the breakfast setup

17:06.372 --> 17:09.373
For the little I'm served
I'm well repaid

17:09.541 --> 17:13.455
By the little that's on the serving maid

17:19.800 --> 17:22.636
The trip downtown
Which once was boring

17:22.804 --> 17:25.556
Now's a journey I k eep adoring

17:25.723 --> 17:29.555
A man is a dope who yells and storms

17:29.727 --> 17:33.345
At the lack of the drivers' uniforms

17:37.610 --> 17:40.361
And at the office during the duration

17:40.529 --> 17:43.020
What a pleasure giving dictation

17:43.199 --> 17:45.950
It ain't so bad in the land of the free

17:46.118 --> 17:48.490
Being a dictator lik e me

17:53.583 --> 17:56.668
And when my lady and I go dining

17:56.836 --> 17:58.876
Though the menu's cloudy
There's a silver lining

17:59.464 --> 18:00.495
That's the one.

18:00.673 --> 18:03.081
A fellow just looks around the floor

18:03.259 --> 18:05.797
Who could ask for anything more?

18:05.970 --> 18:07.797
Who could ask for anything more?

18:08.347 --> 18:11.633
Who's complaining?
I'm not complaining

18:11.809 --> 18:16.020
The sacrifices are few

18:16.188 --> 18:19.272
- My shoes may not be leathery
- My pillow not so feathery

18:19.441 --> 18:21.232
My legs may be forgotten

18:21.401 --> 18:23.358
In cotton

18:23.654 --> 18:25.278
No complaining

18:25.447 --> 18:27.071
Through the campaigning

18:27.240 --> 18:30.905
I'll raise no hullabaloo

18:31.077 --> 18:32.868
My nails may lose their brilliancy

18:33.037 --> 18:35.077
But who cares what civilians see

18:35.248 --> 18:37.786
So long as they don't ration
My passion

18:37.959 --> 18:39.998
For you

18:42.797 --> 18:46.000
Good night. Happy kitchen.

18:47.051 --> 18:50.336
Good night. Happy office.

18:51.013 --> 18:52.804
Good ni...

18:56.309 --> 18:59.061
Good night. Happy taxi.

19:07.028 --> 19:10.231
Good night. Happy smoking.

19:13.743 --> 19:15.901
Have that girl come
and see me tomorrow.

19:16.078 --> 19:20.241
I'm glad you liked her. I thought she
was quite unusual-looking for a blond.

19:20.416 --> 19:22.325
No, the one with the red hair.

19:22.501 --> 19:26.368
Oh, the red hair. Oh, the red hair!

19:30.967 --> 19:32.759
I'll be in the study for calls.

19:32.927 --> 19:37.885
I don't know why you pay me if you
ignore my judgment. Stop whistling!

19:38.057 --> 19:42.386
I wear myself out, wading through
10,000 girls, and out of the 10,000...

19:42.562 --> 19:46.559
you choose a redheaded nervous
breakdown who specializes in sneezes.

19:46.732 --> 19:48.310
She told me so.

19:48.484 --> 19:52.066
That one isn't a girl, John.
She's a leaping thyroid.

19:52.863 --> 19:57.074
I don't believe I've been in a honky-tonk
place like McGuire's for 40 years.

19:57.242 --> 20:02.236
I don't know why I've saved this. Take a
look at it. You're interested in antiques.

20:04.374 --> 20:06.248
If we got her for our cover...

20:06.459 --> 20:09.330
- But, John, this is her.
- Who?

20:09.545 --> 20:11.787
The... The girl, the gland case.

20:12.131 --> 20:14.966
This program is dated 40 years ago.
How could it be?

20:15.176 --> 20:16.967
Well, it couldn't be, but it is.

20:18.804 --> 20:21.722
Forty years ago.

20:22.766 --> 20:28.140
The night I got this, I was sitting
in a box with Tony Pastor.

20:32.359 --> 20:35.313
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.940
I fell in love with her
the minute I saw her.

20:42.577 --> 20:48.033
The fav ourite doesn't always win
No matter what the odds

20:48.207 --> 20:50.994
Since nobody knows
How they'll come in

20:51.168 --> 20:54.085
I leave it to the gods

20:54.254 --> 21:00.506
So wish me luck
Because I'm going to bet on

21:00.677 --> 21:03.631
A sentimental hunch

21:03.805 --> 21:10.472
My heart is suddenly set on

21:12.105 --> 21:15.438
Somehow, I'm sure I've found

21:15.608 --> 21:19.688
The sure thing in you

21:19.862 --> 21:22.531
Something within

21:23.324 --> 21:27.155
Tells me we'll win

21:27.327 --> 21:29.450
Somewhere, my heart

21:29.621 --> 21:34.283
Has pick ed you out of the blue

21:34.543 --> 21:37.413
And since I'm only a beginner

21:37.587 --> 21:41.585
A winner I'll be

21:41.758 --> 21:44.758
But win or lose
Whatever comes up

21:44.927 --> 21:48.676
You're thumbs up With me

21:48.848 --> 21:52.596
One thing I'm sure I'm sure of

21:52.768 --> 21:55.389
All my life through

21:56.772 --> 22:00.721
If love can figure out a sure thing

22:00.901 --> 22:07.484
That sure thing is you

22:07.991 --> 22:11.407
After the races are over

22:11.578 --> 22:15.029
After the races are run

22:15.206 --> 22:18.824
Loser or winner
Let's go out to dinner

22:19.001 --> 22:22.335
And let's have a little
Let's have a little fun

22:22.505 --> 22:25.755
Let's go to Rector's or Shanley's

22:25.925 --> 22:29.543
Champagne and duck are divine

22:29.720 --> 22:32.804
Let's lose our troubles
Imbibing some bubbles

22:32.973 --> 22:36.757
Oh, let's have a little
Let's have a little wine

22:36.935 --> 22:40.386
Then when we're mellow
And feeling alive

22:40.563 --> 22:46.399
Let's tak e a drive along Riverside Drive

22:46.569 --> 22:50.567
No drive in the country for me after dark

22:50.740 --> 22:54.737
My limit is just once around

22:54.910 --> 22:58.077
Central Park

22:58.247 --> 23:01.865
After the races are over

23:02.042 --> 23:05.992
Being with you will be bliss

23:06.171 --> 23:09.706
Perhaps you'll surrender
When gentlemen tender

23:09.883 --> 23:14.094
Say, "Let's have a little
Let's have a little kiss!"

23:15.054 --> 23:18.637
Though you are tender
I cannot surrender

23:18.808 --> 23:23.019
To "Let's have a little
Let's have a little kiss!"

23:48.044 --> 23:51.329
Somehow I'm sure I've found

23:51.506 --> 23:55.254
The sure thing in you

23:55.426 --> 23:59.008
Taking romance

23:59.179 --> 24:02.880
I tak e no chance

24:03.058 --> 24:06.474
Somewhere my heart has pick ed you

24:06.645 --> 24:10.310
Out of the blue

24:10.482 --> 24:14.859
But if it turns out that my long shot's
A wrong shot

24:15.028 --> 24:16.937
Should be

24:17.113 --> 24:20.114
And all my castles come a' tumbling

24:20.283 --> 24:24.115
No grumbling from me

24:24.287 --> 24:27.620
Long shot One thing I'm sure of

24:27.790 --> 24:31.241
All my life through

24:31.418 --> 24:35.630
If love can figure out a sure thing

24:35.797 --> 24:39.795
That sure thing

24:39.968 --> 24:45.923
Is you

24:51.479 --> 24:54.100
- I've got to meet her, Mr. Pastor.
- Now, John...

24:54.273 --> 24:58.401
last time, your mother had the
Decency League investigate my place.

24:58.569 --> 25:00.977
Mother's quite a girl.
Shall we go backstage?

25:01.155 --> 25:04.524
No. Now, in the first place,
Maribelle's already spoken for.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.535
See that boy at the piano?

25:08.328 --> 25:10.653
- Don't bother me with trifles.
- And, John...

25:10.831 --> 25:14.081
I promised your mother I wouldn't
introduce you to girls.

25:14.251 --> 25:18.378
Maribelle isn't just another girl,
Mr. Pastor.

25:19.839 --> 25:21.915
I'm going to marry her.

25:22.091 --> 25:24.000
John. John!

25:26.512 --> 25:28.670
- I'm ready, darling.
- Wonderful, so am I.

25:28.848 --> 25:32.548
John, have you lost your mind?

25:32.851 --> 25:35.389
At your most beautiful service,
mademoiselle.

25:35.562 --> 25:36.891
Well.

25:37.147 --> 25:39.353
- Miss Hicks, how are you?
- Who is this?

25:39.524 --> 25:42.691
- I never saw him before in my life.
- I'm John Coudair.

25:42.861 --> 25:46.027
The only thing in your life,
so make the best of it.

25:46.197 --> 25:51.108
If anyone should enquire for us, we've
gone to Rector's to discuss our future.

25:51.536 --> 25:54.157
Unless it's my mother.
Then you haven't seen me.

25:54.330 --> 25:56.370
Now just a minute.

25:56.541 --> 25:59.376
You're a perfectly enchanting person,
Mr. Coudair.

25:59.543 --> 26:02.497
Not even bad-looking,
in a strange sort of way.

26:02.671 --> 26:06.171
But I have an engagement, and it's
not with you or at Rector.

26:06.342 --> 26:07.919
- But...
- I don't even know you.

26:08.093 --> 26:11.260
What's the difference?
This was meant to be. Can't you see?

26:11.430 --> 26:13.339
You don't belong in a dingy hole.

26:13.515 --> 26:16.385
You should be surrounded
by luxury, beauty, elegance.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.097
I can give you these things, Maribelle.

26:19.270 --> 26:24.691
Just climb aboard my magic carpet,
and away we'll go.

26:25.401 --> 26:28.687
From Rector's we went on to...

26:28.863 --> 26:31.982
Pardon me.

26:33.033 --> 26:35.322
Yes.

26:36.036 --> 26:38.907
Oh, dear, I forgot all about it.

26:39.081 --> 26:41.287
Yes, I'll look it over immediately.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.581
Thanks for reminding me.

26:43.877 --> 26:47.127
That advertising prospectus...

26:47.505 --> 26:50.257
That advertising prospectus
the lender sent over.

26:50.425 --> 26:52.049
Completely slipped my mind.

26:52.218 --> 26:54.010
- Good night.
- Hey, wait a minute.

26:54.178 --> 26:57.678
What does Maribelle got to do
with this kid? Are they related?

26:57.849 --> 27:00.055
I haven't the faintest idea.

27:00.226 --> 27:05.765
By the way, don't wait until tomorrow.
Send that child a wire tonight, will you?

27:06.815 --> 27:08.440
- Hello, Joe
- What do you know?

27:08.609 --> 27:11.100
- I just came back from a bing-bang show
- A sing and a dance

27:11.278 --> 27:12.986
- I'll tak e a chance
- Well, flippity-jippity

27:13.155 --> 27:15.231
- Let's go!
- Okay.

27:19.202 --> 27:23.069
Come on, pearl.

27:24.832 --> 27:27.703
- Oh, how I hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?

27:28.920 --> 27:29.951
I don't get it.

27:30.129 --> 27:33.747
Every Friday night for the last
six months, they order oysters.

27:33.924 --> 27:35.419
Then they don't eat them.

27:35.885 --> 27:38.969
- We don't like oysters.
- Joe, we're looking for a pearl.

27:39.138 --> 27:42.589
The night we find that pearl,
that'll be it. It'll be an omen.

27:42.766 --> 27:45.720
That'll be the time
when things break for all three of us.

27:45.894 --> 27:47.057
- You know what?
- What?

27:47.229 --> 27:50.562
I think it's a fake. I don't think
pearls comes from oysters.

27:50.732 --> 27:54.315
- Pearls don't come from oysters.
- How long since you left Harvard?

27:54.527 --> 27:56.484
Never heard of it. Be reasonable.

27:56.654 --> 27:58.943
How could a oyster give birth
to a pearl?

27:59.157 --> 28:01.279
How could an oyster give birth
to an oyster?

28:01.450 --> 28:03.443
Hey, that's something to think about.

28:03.619 --> 28:06.573
Let them live their lives,
and I'll live mine.

28:06.747 --> 28:08.787
- When? I wanna see that.
- I don't.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.080
Oh, you fools, you.

28:11.251 --> 28:14.916
Rusty, did you find a pearl?

28:15.088 --> 28:17.081
- No pearls.
- No pearls.

28:17.299 --> 28:18.876
Well, better luck tomorrow.

28:19.050 --> 28:20.877
Tomorrow!

28:21.052 --> 28:23.626
Here we go again.

28:24.305 --> 28:28.089
Let's k eep on singing,
"Mak e way for tomorrow!"

28:28.268 --> 28:31.601
The sun is bringing a new day tomorrow

28:31.771 --> 28:35.685
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown

28:35.858 --> 28:37.649
Stand up and win Turn about

28:37.818 --> 28:39.562
Don't give in!
Let's give out!

28:39.737 --> 28:43.236
To the blues
Just refuse to surrender

28:43.407 --> 28:46.989
One smile
And you are a true, solid sender

28:47.160 --> 28:49.319
What if it rains and it pours?

28:49.496 --> 28:51.073
It only rains out of doors!

28:51.248 --> 28:53.324
Let every frown disappear

28:53.500 --> 28:57.497
And you'll find that tomorrow's here

29:03.009 --> 29:04.882
Listen, all
This is Genius calling

29:05.052 --> 29:06.844
- Hear ye!
- Hear ye!

29:07.013 --> 29:10.796
- Why not gather rainbows while ye may?
- While ye may?

29:10.975 --> 29:13.975
You can lose the gremlins
The goblins, the glooms

29:14.144 --> 29:17.264
Laugh and they're back in their tombs

29:17.439 --> 29:20.855
Let's k eep on singing,
"Mak e way for tomorrow!"

29:21.026 --> 29:24.691
The sun is bringing
A new day tomorrow

29:24.863 --> 29:28.647
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown

29:28.825 --> 29:30.652
Stand up and win Turn about

29:30.827 --> 29:32.369
Don't give in Let's give out

29:32.537 --> 29:35.906
To the blues
Just refuse to surrender

29:36.082 --> 29:39.533
One smile
And you are a true, solid sender

29:39.710 --> 29:41.703
What if it rains and it pours?

29:41.879 --> 29:43.539
It only rains out of doors

29:43.714 --> 29:48.506
Let all the frowns disappear
And you'll find that tomorrow's...

31:30.899 --> 31:33.935
That's pretty. That's very, very pretty.

31:37.572 --> 31:40.276
Glad to see you.

31:41.242 --> 31:42.617
Hi, Mac.

31:42.785 --> 31:46.035
Hello, Harry.

31:53.629 --> 31:56.546
Maybe it's a draft notice.

31:59.801 --> 32:02.209
Danny, it's from John Coudair.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.418
Who's he?

32:03.596 --> 32:06.597
He publishes that magazine
that wants a...

32:06.766 --> 32:09.636
He wants me to come
to the office tomorrow.

32:09.811 --> 32:11.720
What do you suppose happened?

32:11.896 --> 32:14.303
How did he ever...?

32:14.482 --> 32:17.566
One hour rehearsal at 10, honey.
I'll see you then.

32:17.735 --> 32:21.483
Yeah, I'll try to make it, Danny.
Good night.

32:37.003 --> 32:38.283
I don't feel good.

32:38.463 --> 32:41.001
Oh, you don't? Where?

32:41.174 --> 32:43.415
In the hall.

32:43.593 --> 32:47.044
I felt sick the minute you got
the telegram. Didn't you, Danny?

32:47.263 --> 32:50.678
I think Rusty knows what she wants
to do with her own life.

32:50.849 --> 32:54.265
- If she wants to go it alone...
- I don't wanna go it alone.

32:54.436 --> 32:57.887
I wanna go it with you, Danny, but...

32:58.065 --> 33:00.187
Well, the man sent for me, Genius.

33:00.358 --> 33:03.644
It just doesn't seem polite not to...

33:03.820 --> 33:05.729
Well, he might not even like me.

33:05.905 --> 33:07.399
Ever see a man that didn't?

33:07.574 --> 33:09.981
- Skip it, will you?
- No, I won't skip it.

33:10.159 --> 33:14.488
I've got some stock in this corporation,
and I'm certainly going to protect it.

33:14.664 --> 33:18.115
I like Danny McGuire's Place
and you two there every night.

33:18.334 --> 33:19.792
I like oysters and...

33:19.960 --> 33:22.914
- You hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?

33:23.088 --> 33:27.501
Then I like opening oysters, and I like
the clowning around in Joe's Place...

33:27.676 --> 33:30.842
and the laughs and the music
and everything.

33:31.012 --> 33:34.927
I like that pearl we're gonna find.

33:37.393 --> 33:39.967
You don't want this.

33:42.190 --> 33:44.348
Do you?

33:56.578 --> 33:59.994
Now you two say good night
like you mean it.

34:10.842 --> 34:13.463
Good night, chicken.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.719
Night, Danny.

34:27.440 --> 34:32.018
You're a genius at everything but
minding your own business, aren't you?

34:32.987 --> 34:36.237
A girl's got a right to make up
her mind about her own life.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.159
Why didn't you let her tear up
her own telegram?

34:39.327 --> 34:42.577
It's things like this that make me
a genius. Ain't they?

34:42.746 --> 34:46.282
Wait until the landlady sees the hall.

34:48.793 --> 34:51.036
All right, I'll clean it up.

34:51.213 --> 34:53.585
Big thing.

35:09.022 --> 35:13.150
- Rusty Park er to see you.
- Send her right in please.

35:16.237 --> 35:18.395
All right, I'm trying not to be excited.

35:18.573 --> 35:21.324
What would you do if your youth
walked in the door?

35:21.492 --> 35:24.777
I'd put braces on its teeth.

35:26.413 --> 35:28.702
- Hello.
- Hello.

35:28.874 --> 35:31.246
Come in.

35:36.298 --> 35:38.586
This is Mr. Coudair, Miss Parker.

35:43.388 --> 35:47.088
- How do you do, Miss Parker?
- How do you do?

35:48.351 --> 35:51.850
Well, you have ambitions
to be a cover girl?

35:52.021 --> 35:55.437
Well... I did have.

35:57.693 --> 36:00.445
I find Miss Parker exceptionally reposed.

36:00.612 --> 36:03.447
- I thought you told me that she leaped.
- She did leap.

36:03.615 --> 36:08.573
What happened to that lovely, gay,
rose-in-the-teeth personality you had?

36:08.828 --> 36:10.786
- Did I look like that?
- Exactly.

36:10.956 --> 36:14.241
No wonder you threw me out.
I'm not a very good actress, am I?

36:14.501 --> 36:15.829
That was acting?

36:16.836 --> 36:18.496
That was acting.

36:18.755 --> 36:20.712
Sit down, won't you?

36:20.882 --> 36:24.796
We saw you, quite by accident,
at Danny McGuire's Place last night.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.625
- You dance beautifully.
- I've had good training.

36:27.805 --> 36:30.841
Apparently.
It seems to come to you so naturally...

36:31.016 --> 36:35.227
I was wondering if someone
in your family were a dancer.

36:35.395 --> 36:37.055
Your mother, perhaps?

36:37.230 --> 36:39.900
Oh, no.
My mother couldn't dance a note.

36:40.066 --> 36:42.901
- She raised cattle.
- Cattle?

36:45.405 --> 36:49.272
My grandmother was a dancer.
I don't suppose you ever heard of her.

36:49.450 --> 36:53.115
- Maribelle Hicks?
- Your grandmother?

36:53.371 --> 36:56.656
Oh, my goodness,
how time flies, doesn't it?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.624
She was kind of a star.

36:59.793 --> 37:03.661
Well, it seems I've mislaid
a few years somewhere.

37:03.839 --> 37:07.883
Is she living, Miss Parker?
Your grandmother?

37:08.385 --> 37:13.627
- No, she died about six months ago.
- I see.

37:15.433 --> 37:19.134
- All right, let's get to work.
- When I think what I've gone through...

37:19.312 --> 37:24.270
trying to find a girl who all the time
was in your desk drawer, I could scream.

37:24.817 --> 37:27.937
- I suppose you're finished with me.
- Finished with you?

37:28.112 --> 37:30.781
My dear child,
we're just beginning with you.

37:31.156 --> 37:35.201
Just climb aboard my magic carpet
and away we'll go.

39:21.052 --> 39:23.460
Did you know Rusty
won this contest, Maurine?

39:23.638 --> 39:27.587
Not until this came out today.
That double-crossing little so-and-so.

39:27.767 --> 39:32.144
- I don't think Danny knows it either.
- She takes a swell picture, doesn't she?

39:32.396 --> 39:34.389
Anyone would with
the trouble they go to.

39:34.565 --> 39:37.186
Your grapes are so sour
I can smell them from here.

39:37.359 --> 39:39.268
Be with you in a minute, kids.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.689
Pretty.

39:40.863 --> 39:42.522
Oh!

39:42.698 --> 39:44.358
What are you...?

39:44.616 --> 39:47.368
- In the mood to be great again tonight?
- Yeah, I'm...

39:47.536 --> 39:49.908
Singing and dancing
all the time, that's me.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.749
Oh, you're such a joy
and comfort to us all.

39:52.916 --> 39:55.869
Yeah, I'm a joy and a...

40:00.381 --> 40:02.420
- Oh, by the way, Genius...
- By the what?

40:02.591 --> 40:04.714
Oh. The way.

40:07.221 --> 40:10.720
- What's the matter with you?
- Just trying out a new step. Like it?

40:10.891 --> 40:13.216
- Cut the clowning, will you?
- Who's clowning?

40:13.393 --> 40:16.145
You're sitting on a piece of paper.

40:16.313 --> 40:20.145
Isn't he silly? Have I got time to sit
on paper? I'm not even sitting.

40:20.317 --> 40:22.143
- Go bake a cake.
- Genius, you're on.

40:22.318 --> 40:24.477
Coming!

40:35.289 --> 40:37.958
Danny, didn't you say
she could live her own life?

40:38.125 --> 40:39.999
Genius!

40:40.169 --> 40:43.205
Go ahead, let them have the face.
You got what's left.

40:43.380 --> 40:45.953
- Genius, you're on!
- Yes.

40:54.766 --> 40:56.972
Hi.

40:57.310 --> 40:59.801
Hi, yourself.

41:00.605 --> 41:04.353
- I think it's swell. Congratulations.
- Well, thank you, Danny.

41:04.608 --> 41:09.104
I think it's swell. Like you said, if you
can get there quicker, why shouldn't you?

41:09.280 --> 41:12.779
- Danny, you wanna know something?
- What?

41:12.950 --> 41:16.283
You were right that
you don't get there on your face.

41:16.453 --> 41:19.454
That magazine's been out all day
and nothing's happened.

41:19.623 --> 41:21.496
Nothing.

41:21.666 --> 41:25.082
I guess I thought the sky
would fall in or something.

41:25.253 --> 41:29.037
Well, it didn't.

41:29.632 --> 41:35.088
This puts me in a great spot, chicken. If
I'm sorry nothing came of it, I'm a liar.

41:35.263 --> 41:38.133
If I'm glad, I'm a heel.

41:38.307 --> 41:41.224
Where do we go from here?

41:41.769 --> 41:44.556
Dancing around the world, Danny.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.438
On my feet.

41:50.777 --> 41:55.024
Sure, I'll marry you. Who is this?
Who?

41:55.198 --> 41:57.985
The New York News?

41:58.535 --> 42:01.108
Yeah, she works here.

42:27.062 --> 42:29.932
- This it?
- This is it. We covered the waterfront.

42:30.106 --> 42:32.431
You have to dig to find a precious stone.

42:32.608 --> 42:35.099
It's up to you to put her
in her proper place.

42:35.278 --> 42:38.314
Brooklyn to Broadway in one cover,
that's quite a jump.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.406
She has an old magic carpet
that came in mighty handy.

42:41.909 --> 42:44.578
- I have a reservation. John Coudair.
- Your hat, sir?

42:44.745 --> 42:47.662
Oh, yes, Mr. Coudair. This way, sir.

42:52.502 --> 42:53.700
- Hello, children.
- Hello.

42:53.879 --> 42:55.622
- Hello, Colby.
- Hello, Jinx.

42:55.797 --> 42:59.664
- Hello. Good hunting, son.
- Thanks, pal.

43:32.040 --> 43:36.037
The days of the good old knights are gone

43:36.210 --> 43:40.290
But chivalry still carries on

43:40.464 --> 43:42.789
I wear no armour
But to my charmer

43:42.967 --> 43:45.967
I hereby pledge my all

43:46.136 --> 43:51.510
In other words
I'm at your beck and call

43:51.683 --> 43:53.842
Put me to the test

43:54.019 --> 43:56.058
And I'll climb you the highest mountain

43:56.229 --> 44:00.891
Or swim you Radio City fountain

44:01.067 --> 44:03.143
Put me to the test

44:03.319 --> 44:05.810
And I'll get you a queen's tiara

44:05.989 --> 44:10.401
Or a pyramid from the hot Sahara

44:10.576 --> 44:14.953
You can dress in sables
At nightclub front tables

44:15.122 --> 44:19.535
If that is what my lady adores

44:19.710 --> 44:22.035
Put me to the test, lady

44:22.212 --> 44:23.754
Just mak e your request

44:23.922 --> 44:28.916
And anything that you desire
Is yours

44:29.094 --> 44:31.964
Put me to the test

44:36.809 --> 44:39.894
Put me to the test

46:52.188 --> 46:55.473
- Oh, stop looking like an old mother cat.
- What do you think?

46:55.649 --> 46:59.267
Why didn't you tell me she had talent,
besides being exciting, beautiful...

46:59.444 --> 47:01.686
What do I think?

47:05.575 --> 47:08.861
- Is this what you want?
- Yeah!

47:10.371 --> 47:13.705
Ladies and gentleman,
your favourite cover girl...

47:13.875 --> 47:18.003
and my favourite dancer, Rusty Parker.

47:22.508 --> 47:25.378
- You didn't bring a trumpet, did you?
- Why a trumpet?

47:25.552 --> 47:27.675
I want to make an impressive entrance.

47:27.930 --> 47:30.634
- Nice going, Rusty.
- Gee, you really...

47:30.807 --> 47:34.093
- Remember what he used to...?
- Knew what she was talking about.

47:34.269 --> 47:37.139
- It was a wonderful feeling.
- What are you crying about?

47:37.314 --> 47:39.769
I don't know.

47:40.024 --> 47:43.358
Kids, imagine a star being born to
parents like me and Danny?

47:43.528 --> 47:46.101
More like someone
giving birth to an earthquake.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.905
Break it up, break it up.

47:48.074 --> 47:51.407
Rusty's skipping the next number.
Take the girls on, will you?

47:51.577 --> 47:57.117
Thanks. I'm the act that follows the act.
Give me some lights. I'll murder them.

47:57.374 --> 48:01.668
Rusty, this happens to very few people.
Take care of it and treat it right.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.746
I beg your pardon.
Oh, here you are.

48:03.922 --> 48:07.172
I've been in the theatre many years,
and I've never seen...

48:07.342 --> 48:08.717
Excuse me, please.

48:08.885 --> 48:12.336
As I was saying, I've been in the
theatre a number of years and...

48:12.514 --> 48:17.009
- As I was saying, I've been in the theatre...
- I'm beginning to believe that.

48:17.268 --> 48:19.011
- Hello, Rusty.
- Hello, Mr. Coudair.

48:19.187 --> 48:21.559
Hello, Miss Jackson.
Danny, these are...

48:21.731 --> 48:24.400
- Well, this is Mr. McGuire.
- How do you do, sir?

48:24.567 --> 48:25.942
I was saying that I've...

48:26.110 --> 48:28.945
This gentleman has been in theatre
a good many years.

48:29.113 --> 48:32.446
You've been in my theatre many
years too. Why don't you scram?

48:32.616 --> 48:34.941
- Of course we'll go. We...
- That's all right.

48:35.118 --> 48:37.609
You're perfectly welcome
to stay, but this guy...

48:37.787 --> 48:40.954
This guy is with us, Mr. McGuire.
We brung him.

48:41.124 --> 48:43.793
- I'm sorry.
- That's my one virtue: Nice friends.

48:43.960 --> 48:47.792
Rusty, this is Noel Wheaton of
Wheaton's Theatre. This is Mr. McGuire.

48:47.964 --> 48:50.087
- Hello. How are you?
- One side, please.

48:50.258 --> 48:53.258
We're a little crowded here.
Would you mind moving?

48:53.511 --> 48:56.049
- Forgive us.
- Make yourselves at home, will you?

48:56.222 --> 48:58.843
Look, people with clothes on.

48:59.016 --> 49:01.685
I have to get on next.
Would you excuse me? Maurine.

49:01.852 --> 49:03.975
- Coming.
- Miss Parker...

49:04.271 --> 49:07.188
- Oh, hello, Miss Jackson.
- Hello.

49:07.357 --> 49:10.477
Why didn't you tell me
you wanted somebody animated?

49:10.652 --> 49:13.190
I was just holding myself in
when I was in your...

49:13.363 --> 49:16.862
- Have you gone batty or something?
- Is it something in me...

49:17.033 --> 49:19.738
- that brings that out in people?
- Sorry.

49:20.036 --> 49:22.361
Can't we go to your
dressing room and talk?

49:22.538 --> 49:26.536
- Well, I dress with seven other girls.
- You dress with seven other girls?

49:26.709 --> 49:31.086
Yes, and they talk a lot
and get dressed and undressed...

49:32.881 --> 49:36.630
Wouldn't it be simpler if we just lay down
and let them walk over us?

49:36.802 --> 49:40.716
- I don't know why we're here anyway.
- We're offering Miss Parker a job.

49:40.889 --> 49:44.340
- Oh, but I have a job.
- Rusty, you gotta make that change.

49:44.517 --> 49:46.225
- Mr. McGuire.
- Excuse me.

49:46.394 --> 49:49.181
We are definitely in the man's way here.
Let's find...

49:49.355 --> 49:52.190
How do you feel about
selling Miss Parker's contract?

49:52.358 --> 49:54.018
Miss Parker has no contract.

49:54.193 --> 49:58.273
- No... Oh, what are we waiting for?
- I don't know. What are you waiting for?

49:58.447 --> 50:01.068
Miss Parker's free to
work for me if she wants?

50:01.325 --> 50:04.279
Miss Parker'd be free to work for you
if she wanted to...

50:04.453 --> 50:07.157
whether she'd signed a paper or not.

50:07.331 --> 50:10.830
You don't understand people
working together that way, do you?

50:11.001 --> 50:14.416
- No, I don't.
- No, you wouldn't.

50:14.671 --> 50:17.126
- Make your change, Rusty.
- Okay.

50:17.298 --> 50:22.838
- Well, I hope I see you again sometime.
- You'll see nothing but me, beautiful.

50:23.012 --> 50:27.888
That sounds very exciting,
coming from the great Noel Wheaton.

50:29.268 --> 50:32.851
You know, he said you were free to
come work for me if you wanted.

50:33.022 --> 50:37.730
- I know he did. Good night.
- Good night.

50:39.403 --> 50:43.530
- I guess my trumpet was out of tune.
- I thought I heard a sour note.

50:43.698 --> 50:46.272
Baby! You were wonderful tonight.

50:46.451 --> 50:50.151
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I mistook you for somebody else.

50:50.330 --> 50:53.449
- Glad to see you.
- So sorry.

50:53.624 --> 50:55.831
Excuse me.

50:58.087 --> 51:01.004
- Oh, wait!
- Gangway.

51:16.730 --> 51:19.730
- Busy little place tonight, wasn't it?
- Yeah, wasn't it?

51:19.899 --> 51:23.233
One had to chop one's way through
the upper crust, didn't one?

51:23.403 --> 51:25.810
Yeah, one did.

51:25.988 --> 51:27.815
Shortcuts are no good, huh?

51:27.990 --> 51:31.774
They only make you famous overnight.
That's all. No work, no nothing.

51:31.952 --> 51:35.238
Just smile at the birdie,
and boom! You're in.

51:36.123 --> 51:42.493
Name in all the papers. Big stars
sending you pretty dresses for nothing.

51:42.671 --> 51:44.498
That was terrific tonight.

51:44.881 --> 51:47.206
You bet it was terrific.

51:47.384 --> 51:49.957
Best goodbye music
I ever danced to.

51:53.431 --> 51:56.183
Yeah, tonight was really terrific.

51:56.350 --> 52:00.218
See a thing like that happen
right under your eyes.

52:00.396 --> 52:03.765
Something you wanted for someone
all their life.

52:03.941 --> 52:06.811
You haven't known me all my life.

52:06.986 --> 52:09.737
Six months then.

52:10.739 --> 52:12.150
Seven.

52:13.867 --> 52:16.073
Seven then.

52:16.995 --> 52:23.578
Seven months, three days,
four hours, 23 minutes.

52:23.751 --> 52:26.456
It was Tuesday.

52:27.588 --> 52:32.713
Long ago and far away

52:32.885 --> 52:36.585
I dreamed a dream one day

52:36.764 --> 52:42.434
And now that dream is here beside me

52:42.603 --> 52:47.644
Long the skies were overcast

52:47.816 --> 52:51.350
But now the clouds have passed

52:51.528 --> 52:57.779
You're here at last

52:57.950 --> 53:03.324
Chills run up and down my spine

53:03.497 --> 53:07.198
Aladdin's lamp is mine

53:07.376 --> 53:12.999
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

53:13.173 --> 53:15.629
Just one look

53:15.801 --> 53:19.750
And then I knew

53:20.972 --> 53:25.385
That all I longed for

53:25.560 --> 53:31.230
Long ago was you

53:39.615 --> 53:43.149
I dreamed a dream one day

53:43.327 --> 53:48.487
And now that dream is here beside me

53:48.665 --> 53:52.876
Long the skies were overcast

53:53.044 --> 53:56.994
But now the clouds have passed

53:57.173 --> 54:02.333
You're here at last

54:02.512 --> 54:07.968
Chills run up and down my spine

54:08.142 --> 54:11.641
Aladdin's lamp is mine

54:11.812 --> 54:16.937
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

54:17.109 --> 54:19.813
Just one look

54:19.986 --> 54:23.984
And then I knew

54:25.617 --> 54:30.658
That all I longed for

54:30.830 --> 54:37.413
Long ago was you

55:34.557 --> 55:38.341
Egad, this place looks
like a funeral parlour.

55:38.519 --> 55:40.677
Nobody cares if roses give
me hay fever.

55:40.855 --> 55:43.262
- Where are your shoes?
- In the dressing room!

55:43.440 --> 55:45.433
- Get them!
- I can't! The dressing room...

55:45.609 --> 55:48.230
is full of photographers taking
pictures of the mirror!

55:48.403 --> 55:49.518
For Pete's sake, why?

55:49.696 --> 55:55.070
It's gonna be in the Sunday paper. The
mirror where Rusty first saw her face.

55:55.952 --> 55:58.324
- Mr. McGuire.
- I know. Do the best you can.

55:58.496 --> 56:01.283
That newspaperwoman is eating
my precious food.

56:01.457 --> 56:04.826
She is doing a story on what food
makes the figure of Rusty Parker.

56:05.002 --> 56:07.042
- I said, do the best you can.
- I quit.

56:07.213 --> 56:09.289
All right, then quit!

56:09.507 --> 56:10.538
- Genius.
- Yes.

56:10.716 --> 56:12.673
- Where is Rusty? Find her.
- Relax.

56:12.843 --> 56:15.963
She's all right. She's on the stage
being interviewed.

56:18.140 --> 56:21.010
- I'm 10 minutes slow.
- Are the flowers from Mr. Wheaton?

56:21.184 --> 56:23.510
Yes, every hour, on the hour,
for a week.

56:23.687 --> 56:25.810
Can you tell us about their romance?

56:25.981 --> 56:28.104
Which of you did she love
before Mr. Wheaton?

56:28.275 --> 56:30.066
It was I, but I beat her.

56:30.235 --> 56:33.354
Mr. McGuire. Smile.

56:38.493 --> 56:40.699
- Where's Rusty?
- We want her autograph.

56:40.870 --> 56:43.111
Wait outside. We're trying to rehearse.

56:43.289 --> 56:46.455
- Give me your autograph.
- You don't even know who I am.

56:46.625 --> 56:47.656
Yes, I do.

56:47.835 --> 56:51.369
- You're Rusty Parker's boyfriend.
- I'll tell him when he comes.

56:51.588 --> 56:55.004
You can have my autograph.
Single file. I'll take you first.

56:55.175 --> 56:56.254
You ain't nobody.

56:56.426 --> 57:00.044
Maybe we can catch her
out in the alley. Come on!

57:01.848 --> 57:04.600
Just a minute. The girls
are too busy to see you.

57:04.767 --> 57:07.768
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

57:17.988 --> 57:21.523
That's fine, John. Play billiards
while my theatre falls apart.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.776
- Good afternoon.
- What's good about it?

57:23.952 --> 57:27.286
It's another day for me to worry about
how I'll open my show.

57:27.456 --> 57:30.540
Now I'm sending roses
every 15 minutes.

57:30.750 --> 57:35.459
You got me this way. Do something.
I tried everything this side of kidnapping.

57:35.672 --> 57:37.498
What is this side of kidnapping?

57:37.715 --> 57:39.708
Please don't be humorous.

57:39.926 --> 57:41.883
You're humorous, both of you.

57:42.053 --> 57:43.962
You're attempting the impossible:

57:44.138 --> 57:47.341
Lure a girl away from a guy
she loves with things.

57:47.516 --> 57:52.890
It won't work, and I'm dame enough to
be glad of it. What do you think of that?

57:53.063 --> 57:56.562
I had the same problem with her
grandmother. I mean, her mother.

57:56.858 --> 57:59.183
Whose mother?

58:01.154 --> 58:03.396
Nobody's, believe me.

58:03.573 --> 58:06.693
But it can be done.
I want that child on Broadway.

58:06.993 --> 58:08.820
Everything's set and ready to go.

58:08.995 --> 58:13.158
- Frame's built, and no face to go in it.
- You'll have the face. Let me work on it.

58:13.332 --> 58:15.372
Gladly, only work fast, will you? I...

58:15.543 --> 58:19.243
Immediately. Tomorrow night, in fact.
Keep the evening open.

58:19.421 --> 58:23.253
Enter the mastermind.

58:25.052 --> 58:27.969
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

58:34.310 --> 58:38.806
All is clear, master.
You may bring forth the treasure.

58:41.317 --> 58:45.528
No photographers, no adoring public.
Zounds, princess, you are slipping.

58:45.696 --> 58:49.694
- Listen to what I'm saying.
- You said Mr. Coudair was sentimental.

58:49.867 --> 58:52.903
I said he can be sentimental
on his own time. Then what?

58:53.078 --> 58:55.285
Look.

58:56.331 --> 58:58.573
- Genius, explain it to him.
- Mr. McGuire...

58:58.750 --> 59:03.792
You don't need to explain. You want
to skip the show and go to a party.

59:03.964 --> 59:04.995
The second show.

59:05.173 --> 59:07.960
It's an anniversary dinner
at Mr. Coudair's house.

59:08.134 --> 59:11.468
- Imagine, eating in a house.
- It's Vanity's 50th birthday.

59:11.637 --> 59:14.175
Why waste good food
on an old hag like that?

59:14.348 --> 59:16.305
Will you please stop clowning?

59:16.475 --> 59:19.180
I'm the Golden Wedding Girl,
so he wants me there.

59:19.353 --> 59:23.137
And because you work
at Danny McGuire's, I want you there.

59:23.315 --> 59:25.355
Do you only think of what you want?

59:25.526 --> 59:27.933
Mr. Coudair has the right
to want something.

59:28.111 --> 59:32.275
Once won't hurt. The guy's sentimental.
It can't happen again for 50 years.

59:32.449 --> 59:35.782
You think he'd be sentimental
if she worked in Wheaton's show?

59:35.952 --> 59:38.490
He wouldn't. Why should he
kick our show around...

59:38.663 --> 59:41.913
- because it's Brooklyn?
- It's not kicking your show around...

59:42.083 --> 59:46.579
that he's brought you more business
because of me than you've had before!

59:48.255 --> 59:50.295
I wondered when that was coming.

59:50.466 --> 59:54.926
That's what the ads read. " Come to
Danny McGuire's to see Rusty Parker."

59:55.095 --> 59:58.096
All the more reason you should
be there when they come.

59:58.265 --> 01:00:03.306
I'll be there, Danny, for the first show.
But after the first show, I'm leaving.

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:06.598
And you can get mad if you want to.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.856
Oh, she's a great kid, always clowning.

01:00:12.028 --> 01:00:14.435
You don't think she'd really do that,
do you?

01:00:14.614 --> 01:00:16.405
Great sense of humour, that kid.

01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:32.170
Peace, it's wonderful.
What quieted all of you down?

01:00:35.175 --> 01:00:37.880
- Where's Rusty?
- She went to a party.

01:00:38.178 --> 01:00:40.384
You should've seen how swell
she looked.

01:00:40.597 --> 01:00:45.258
Just one word from you, and she does
what she likes, doesn't she, boss?

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:47.392
- On stage.
- Just the six of us?

01:00:47.562 --> 01:00:49.554
Space it a little. You can cover it.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.770
We will, Danny.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.400
Yeah, great sense of humour, that kid.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.406
You know, Danny, the funniest thing
just happened.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:04.406
Coudair's more sentimental than
anybody I heard of. Did you know that?

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.199
- Touching.
- He's even sentimental about us.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:11.370
Yeah, he just phoned. He wants you
to come to the party to pick Rusty up.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:15.243
Imagine that. A guy like him who's
got a barrelful of rubies...

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:17.544
and he's sentimental about a pearl.

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:20.550
I guess he thinks it'd be nice
if we were friends.

01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:24.846
You have a great brain. Sometimes
it almost frightens me, you're so bright.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.968
You know, sometimes
it almost frightens me too.

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:30.977
But you're going to the party,
aren't you, Danny?

01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:33.220
Sure.

01:01:33.772 --> 01:01:36.345
Sure, I'm going.

01:01:36.775 --> 01:01:39.182
I love parties.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.618
Here's the church, there's the steeple.
Open the door, and where's the people?

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:54.870
I beg your pardon.

01:01:55.042 --> 01:01:57.794
Oh, a nursery rhyme.
I beg your pardon.

01:01:57.962 --> 01:02:00.168
Yes, sir. Will you come into the study?

01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:03.458
Mr. Coudair asked
that you be brought right in.

01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:10.343
- Nice to see you, Mr. McGuire.
- Nice to see you too, Mr. Coudair.

01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:12.265
I guess I'm a little mixed-up.

01:02:12.434 --> 01:02:14.675
Your message said Rusty'd be here.

01:02:14.853 --> 01:02:18.636
Yes, well, we changed plans
at the last minute, and we've...

01:02:18.815 --> 01:02:20.807
Won't you sit down and have a drink?

01:02:20.983 --> 01:02:23.059
Thanks.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.771
Where is Rusty, Mr. Coudair?

01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:31.030
I don't really know.

01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:35.697
She and Mr. Wheaton had some sort of
an evening figured out, I understand.

01:02:36.832 --> 01:02:39.916
This isn't the right direction
for Mr. Coudair's house.

01:02:40.085 --> 01:02:43.750
You're being kidnapped. You like it?

01:02:43.922 --> 01:02:46.673
You're not very complimentary.
You're not scared.

01:02:46.841 --> 01:02:50.127
What are you talking about?
Aren't we going to a party?

01:02:50.303 --> 01:02:54.799
Sure we are. But I just want to stop by
my theatre first for a couple of minutes.

01:02:54.974 --> 01:02:58.923
I have kind of a problem that I thought
maybe you could help me with.

01:02:59.103 --> 01:03:00.561
All right?

01:03:00.729 --> 01:03:04.727
Why, I suppose so.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.565
But won't Mr. Coudair wonder
where we are?

01:03:08.737 --> 01:03:11.940
I don't think so. No.

01:03:12.699 --> 01:03:15.154
Beauty like hers demands things,
Mr. McGuire:

01:03:15.326 --> 01:03:18.161
Luxury, gentle living, money.

01:03:18.329 --> 01:03:20.701
- I have these.
- Are you sure she wants them?

01:03:20.873 --> 01:03:22.866
What beautiful young girl doesn't?

01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:26.078
Have you given her the chance
to make up her own mind?

01:03:26.254 --> 01:03:28.542
Have you?

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:33.707
That's fair enough.
Why don't we leave it up to her?

01:03:33.886 --> 01:03:36.211
She won't leave you.
She's in love with you.

01:03:36.388 --> 01:03:38.594
- I'm in love with her.
- I doubt that.

01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:41.932
If you were, you wouldn't let her
remain in obscurity.

01:03:42.102 --> 01:03:46.395
Don't you think I'd make her go
if I thought she'd be happier with...?

01:03:47.107 --> 01:03:49.776
No, Mr. Coudair, I don't believe
she would be.

01:03:49.943 --> 01:03:52.896
I don't believe it for a minute. L...

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.482
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.031
Yes.

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.576
I've never seen that picture before.
Is it new?

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:09.167
That is a picture of Rusty's
grandmother, Mr. McGuire.

01:04:09.336 --> 01:04:12.502
- I was very much in love with her.
- Well, I'll be darned.

01:04:12.672 --> 01:04:16.041
That's exactly what I said to myself
when I first saw Rusty.

01:04:16.217 --> 01:04:18.755
Amazing resemblance, isn't there?

01:04:18.928 --> 01:04:21.965
She was a dancer too,
worked at Tony Pastor's.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.682
Tony Pastor's, huh?

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.510
It was wrong for her...

01:04:25.685 --> 01:04:28.555
as Danny McGuire's is wrong
for her granddaughter.

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:30.638
You decided that right away, huh?

01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:32.937
Yes, so I asked her to marry me.

01:04:33.108 --> 01:04:35.315
Did she?

01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:37.893
Sit down, won't you?

01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:42.279
I'll never forget the day I asked her up
here to meet my mother.

01:04:42.576 --> 01:04:46.276
My mother was society,
and Maribelle a girl from the stage.

01:04:46.454 --> 01:04:50.037
Maribelle stood there with her chin up
and her knees shaking...

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:53.577
and Mother was looking
her over very thoroughly.

01:04:53.753 --> 01:04:58.830
Mother just shook her head
and said, "Poor John."

01:04:59.592 --> 01:05:03.091
I don't suppose you remember
a song called "Poor John."

01:05:03.262 --> 01:05:04.840
That's how she punished me...

01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:09.640
by singing it until everyone
in New York knew that I was "Poor John."

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.221
Let me tell you about one night.

01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:34.205
I ought to think myself a lucky girl

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.083
I know

01:05:36.252 --> 01:05:39.252
'Cause I'm engaged
But still somehow

01:05:39.421 --> 01:05:42.457
I don't think so

01:05:42.633 --> 01:05:47.259
John, that's the name of my finance
You see

01:05:47.429 --> 01:05:49.505
There's no mistak e

01:05:49.681 --> 01:05:53.264
He's very fond of me

01:05:53.935 --> 01:05:59.060
He took me out for walks
And, oh, he was so nice

01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.316
He always used to kiss me

01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:06.316
On the same place twice

01:06:06.489 --> 01:06:12.194
Often in the park
We would sit and spoon

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:15.405
And I was, oh, so happy

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:21.416
Till the other afternoon

01:06:22.754 --> 01:06:27.712
John took me round to see his mother

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:32.842
His mother His mother

01:06:33.014 --> 01:06:37.260
And when he introduced us
To each other

01:06:37.434 --> 01:06:41.977
She weighed up everything that I had on

01:06:42.147 --> 01:06:47.224
She put me through a cross-examination

01:06:47.402 --> 01:06:52.230
I fairly boiled with aggravation

01:06:52.407 --> 01:06:54.779
Then she shook her head

01:06:54.951 --> 01:06:57.703
Look ed at me and said:

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:03.706
"Poor John, poor John"

01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:14.841
His mother

01:07:23.728 --> 01:07:28.556
She put me through a cross-examination

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:33.359
I fairly boiled with aggravation

01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:35.736
Then she shook her head

01:07:35.906 --> 01:07:37.698
Look ed at me and said:

01:07:37.867 --> 01:07:42.908
"Poor John, poor John"

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.283
John took you around to see his mother

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:50.041
His mother His mother

01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:53.545
And when he introduced them
To each other

01:07:53.715 --> 01:07:57.166
She weighed up everything that I had on

01:07:57.343 --> 01:08:00.878
She put her through a cross-examination

01:08:01.055 --> 01:08:04.554
I fairly boiled with aggravation

01:08:04.725 --> 01:08:06.220
Then she shook her head

01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:07.769
And look ed at her and said:

01:08:07.937 --> 01:08:12.065
"Poor John, poor John"

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:26.242
She weighed up everything that I had on

01:08:26.412 --> 01:08:29.995
She put her through a cross-examination

01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:34.828
I fairly boiled with aggravation

01:08:41.719 --> 01:08:43.961
Then she shook her head

01:08:44.138 --> 01:08:45.417
Look ed at me and said:

01:08:45.596 --> 01:08:50.093
"Poor John, poor John"

01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:57.018
Hello, Maribelle.

01:08:57.192 --> 01:08:59.268
Hello.

01:09:02.322 --> 01:09:04.859
I wish you weren't upset
about the way Mother...

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:07.986
- She's lived a sort of conventional life.
- Upset?

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.912
Why, I'm delighted.
Mr. Pastor's delighted.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.033
The piano player's delighted.
Everybody's delighted.

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:16.413
We think your mother's very intelligent.

01:09:16.794 --> 01:09:17.956
Listen, Maribelle, l...

01:09:18.337 --> 01:09:22.251
A very intelligent woman. Why, she
knows I don't belong on Fifth Avenue.

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:27.216
She knows I belong right here. And now
I do too, not that I didn't know it before.

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:30.383
I don't believe it.
I didn't before and still don't.

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:34.473
Oh, John, dear, we've been through
all this before.

01:09:34.644 --> 01:09:38.013
But I didn't quite know
how right I was until...

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:41.854
I was very uncomfortable
in that pile of rock you call a house.

01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:43.859
That was because of Mother.

01:09:44.028 --> 01:09:46.067
From now on, Mother doesn't exist.

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:50.069
Nothing exists that can come
between you and me, do you hear? I...

01:09:52.243 --> 01:09:54.450
What's that?

01:09:54.663 --> 01:09:56.406
That's him.

01:10:02.879 --> 01:10:05.204
He's hard to keep out, isn't he?

01:10:05.381 --> 01:10:06.792
Maribelle, listen to me.

01:10:06.966 --> 01:10:10.086
I know what he has to offer.
I know what this has to offer.

01:10:10.261 --> 01:10:13.262
It's nothing to what I can give you.
He loves you.

01:10:13.431 --> 01:10:18.258
But not the way I do. Forty years from
now I'll love you more then I do now.

01:10:18.477 --> 01:10:20.849
What you have now,
you can have a million times.

01:10:21.021 --> 01:10:24.604
All the things you tell me
are important: Love, fun, music.

01:10:24.775 --> 01:10:27.645
If you marry me, you'll have
all of them. I promise.

01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:30.310
The very best that money can buy.

01:10:30.822 --> 01:10:33.360
Now do you understand
my interest in Rusty?

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:39.820
It's like my youth has come back after
having been away a long, long time.

01:10:39.997 --> 01:10:42.453
Who was playing the piano?

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:45.579
A very ordinary, young fellow
who worked there.

01:10:45.753 --> 01:10:46.915
In love with her.

01:10:47.087 --> 01:10:50.456
What difference does that make?
He had nothing to offer her.

01:10:50.632 --> 01:10:51.831
Like me.

01:10:52.009 --> 01:10:54.297
If you like.

01:10:55.554 --> 01:10:58.923
Thanks for a very interesting evening,
Mr. Coudair.

01:10:59.099 --> 01:11:03.310
But it's after 1:00, and Rusty'll
be waiting at a place we know.

01:11:03.478 --> 01:11:06.051
I wouldn't be too sure about that,
Mr. McGuire.

01:11:06.272 --> 01:11:10.601
At the risk of repeating myself,
Rusty wants what we have to give her.

01:11:10.777 --> 01:11:14.477
Good night, Mr. Coudair.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.531
It certainly is big, isn't it?

01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:30.627
You ought to see it when it's filled
with 2000 people.

01:11:30.837 --> 01:11:33.328
Two thousand?

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:37.290
And look at the orchestra.
We only have six in ours.

01:11:37.468 --> 01:11:39.461
What do you do with so much room?

01:11:39.637 --> 01:11:43.765
Watching you at McGuire's, I'm amazed
how well you handle the space.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:46.340
I'd think you'd be knocking
each other down.

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:49.934
Sometimes we do wish we had
a stage as big as this one.

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:53.391
This stage is yours
for the asking, Rusty.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:59.062
My goodness, it must be at least
a half a mile wide.

01:11:59.865 --> 01:12:02.320
Did you ever dance on a stage
as big as this?

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:07.118
It's more like flying than dancing,
the freedom of it.

01:12:07.288 --> 01:12:13.208
Close your eyes. Go on, close
your eyes just to get the feel of it.

01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:01.999
Looks like she's not coming,
huh, Danny?

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:05.466
Maybe she forgot it was Friday.

01:13:15.686 --> 01:13:19.731
Hey, don't be a schlemoil.

01:13:22.026 --> 01:13:24.730
Schlemiel.

01:13:35.497 --> 01:13:39.079
Beauty lik e Rusty's demands
things, huh?

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:43.711
She loves me. I love her,
and that's all two people need.

01:13:44.672 --> 01:13:49.049
Then why didn't she meet you
at the oyster bar tonight?

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:54.801
Something happened.
She'll explain it tomorrow.

01:13:54.974 --> 01:13:58.508
Wait a minute, Danny McGuire!

01:13:58.936 --> 01:14:01.474
She stood you up, and you know it.

01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:04.316
She's out with Wheaton,
and you know that too.

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:07.733
So she's out with Wheaton.
What difference does it mak e?

01:14:07.903 --> 01:14:10.025
Danny!

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.859
Don't be such a hardheaded Irishman
for once.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:18.735
If you really loved Rusty,
you'd let her go.

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:25.245
Coudair's right. You have nothing
to give her. Wheaton has everything.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.869
Hey!

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:30.538
Danny!

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:33.586
You can't run away from yourself.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.469
You gotta make up your mind,
and I'm gonna see that you do it now.

01:14:39.724 --> 01:14:42.511
Wait a minute! Stop!

01:17:27.258 --> 01:17:28.538
Hi, Lucy! Am I late?

01:17:28.718 --> 01:17:31.553
Can't you see for yourself?

01:17:32.054 --> 01:17:35.174
I dreamed a dream one day

01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:42.098
And now that dream is here beside me
Long...

01:17:42.272 --> 01:17:43.766
Danny!

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.850
Hello, Rusty!

01:17:46.026 --> 01:17:47.105
Yeah?

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.442
What's Maurine doing
singing my number?

01:17:50.822 --> 01:17:55.780
She was here. Maurine, go to the piano
and get up on the second A. You're flat.

01:17:55.952 --> 01:17:57.909
Okay, Danny.

01:17:58.871 --> 01:18:00.698
But you knew I was coming.

01:18:01.165 --> 01:18:05.626
Did I? It's a quarter of 11.
Rehearsals are called for 10.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:11.039
Is 45 minutes something
to make a crisis about?

01:18:11.258 --> 01:18:15.042
Kind of an amazing thing
happened last night, Danny.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.505
It's no use my trying
to explain it to you...

01:18:18.682 --> 01:18:22.513
because I can't explain it to me.

01:18:22.936 --> 01:18:25.806
I don't suppose you understand
what I mean, do you?

01:18:26.314 --> 01:18:28.721
Sure we do. It's very clear,
isn't it, Danny?

01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:31.942
Do you mind if I take care of this
my way for a change?

01:18:32.111 --> 01:18:34.436
I don't know why
you're making a big deal...

01:18:34.613 --> 01:18:37.780
You've met so many people,
you forgot what I look like.

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:39.777
I'm the man with the whip.

01:18:39.952 --> 01:18:45.076
I'm the guy who's got a swell place
that means more to me than anything...

01:18:45.248 --> 01:18:46.873
or anybody.

01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:50.208
If you're late, Maurine goes in.
She should get up in it...

01:18:50.378 --> 01:18:53.545
because it looks like
she'll end up doing it.

01:18:53.715 --> 01:18:57.297
You see, to Maurine,
this place comes first.

01:18:57.468 --> 01:19:00.588
You've hated it ever since
I got to be a cover girl.

01:19:00.805 --> 01:19:02.216
You want to be the big shot.

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:06.553
There isn't any room
in Danny McGuire's for any big shot.

01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:10.427
Well, if you don't want me here,
why don't you say so?

01:19:10.606 --> 01:19:15.149
If I'm messing up your precious
little place, why don't you say so?

01:19:15.319 --> 01:19:17.892
I've got someplace to go.
I'm not dependent on...

01:19:18.196 --> 01:19:19.477
Why don't you go then?

01:19:28.748 --> 01:19:31.120
Okay.

01:19:38.757 --> 01:19:44.262
I'm certainly glad I found out you felt
this way, Danny, before it was too late.

01:19:44.429 --> 01:19:47.099
- You bet I'll go. I've got...
- I know. You told me.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.101
So if you wanna see me again,
Danny McGuire...

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:53.891
you can just come to Broadway...

01:19:54.064 --> 01:19:57.314
to a big show!

01:19:58.151 --> 01:20:02.398
Why don't you cut off your arms
and legs and do a good job of it?

01:20:17.794 --> 01:20:20.997
Soldiers and civilians
People by the millions

01:20:21.173 --> 01:20:24.339
Want to see the perfect cover girl

01:20:24.509 --> 01:20:27.379
So I've tak en
Lots of candid-camera shots

01:20:27.554 --> 01:20:30.507
Of beauty My duty

01:20:30.682 --> 01:20:34.133
There's nothing lik e perfection
So in that connection

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:37.430
I present my perfect cover girl

01:20:37.605 --> 01:20:38.885
Number one I list her

01:20:39.065 --> 01:20:45.352
How can I resist her?

01:20:45.529 --> 01:20:48.483
I've seen the one I go for

01:20:48.657 --> 01:20:51.777
One I've look ed high and low for

01:20:51.952 --> 01:20:54.656
Life's not complete

01:20:56.039 --> 01:20:58.612
Till I meet that girl on the cover

01:20:58.792 --> 01:21:01.745
My problem has me sighing

01:21:01.919 --> 01:21:06.581
She k eeps electrifying me

01:21:06.757 --> 01:21:10.837
But is she fancy-free?

01:21:12.221 --> 01:21:13.383
We'd mak e a team

01:21:13.556 --> 01:21:15.347
That could be supreme

01:21:15.516 --> 01:21:18.516
With love that's everlasting

01:21:19.895 --> 01:21:21.852
It wouldn't be extreme

01:21:22.064 --> 01:21:25.479
To call us perfect casting

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:29.066
Love, help a helpless lover

01:21:30.446 --> 01:21:33.650
Love, come and help uncover that girl

01:21:33.825 --> 01:21:36.861
On the cover for me

01:24:17.897 --> 01:24:20.897
I've seen the one I go for

01:24:21.066 --> 01:24:23.984
One I've look ed high and low for

01:24:24.153 --> 01:24:26.940
Life's not complete

01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:30.648
Till I meet that girl on the cover

01:24:30.826 --> 01:24:34.111
My problem has me sighing

01:24:34.287 --> 01:24:38.748
She k eeps electrifying me

01:24:38.917 --> 01:24:42.748
But is she fancy-free?

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.167
We'd mak e a team
That could be supreme

01:24:47.341 --> 01:24:50.591
With love that's everlasting

01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:54.089
It wouldn't be extreme

01:24:54.264 --> 01:24:57.431
To call us perfect casting

01:24:57.601 --> 01:25:00.471
Love, help a helpless lover

01:25:00.645 --> 01:25:04.773
Love, come and help uncover that girl

01:25:04.941 --> 01:25:09.769
On the cover for me

01:25:48.399 --> 01:25:51.649
I've seen the one I go for

01:25:51.819 --> 01:25:55.401
One I've look ed high and low for

01:25:55.572 --> 01:25:58.526
Life's not complete

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:08.202
Till I meet that girl on the cover

01:26:15.925 --> 01:26:19.258
- Fun tonight, beautiful?
- Lots of fun. It always is.

01:26:19.428 --> 01:26:21.587
Glad we ditched
Jackson and Mr. Coudair?

01:26:21.764 --> 01:26:22.795
I like them.

01:26:22.973 --> 01:26:25.345
You can like somebody
and not want to live with them.

01:26:25.559 --> 01:26:27.101
- Yes.
- You can't love someone...

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:30.104
- and not want to.
- No.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:32.478
Can you?

01:26:36.236 --> 01:26:38.525
No.

01:26:39.239 --> 01:26:42.738
Do you know I've never asked
anybody to marry me?

01:26:42.909 --> 01:26:44.486
You've missed half your life.

01:26:44.661 --> 01:26:46.902
The first half.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:50.614
I wouldn't like to miss
the second half too, Rusty.

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:55.461
Oh, I'm home! I'm always so surprised
when I get home so quick.

01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:59.247
When I lived in Brooklyn it took...

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.169
Okay.

01:27:03.345 --> 01:27:05.883
I'm in love with you, Rusty.

01:27:06.056 --> 01:27:09.092
But that's no surprise to you, is it?

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.176
Not exactly.

01:27:11.353 --> 01:27:13.678
I want to marry you.

01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:16.103
That's a surprise, isn't it?

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:20.060
I never thought of you
as a family man, exactly.

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:21.896
Oh, good heavens, I'm not.

01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.482
But...

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:28.031
I don't suppose you're in love
with me at all, are you?

01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:32.704
I think you're one of the swellest persons
I've ever known.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:40.167
There's no emotional hangover,
is there, Rusty?

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:44.082
I mean, from Brooklyn?

01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:48.052
Well, then?

01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:51.388
Can I tell you tomorrow?

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.387
Okay, beautiful.

01:27:55.895 --> 01:27:59.228
If you don't care
that I'll age 10 years tonight.

01:27:59.398 --> 01:28:02.981
You should be a very distinguished-
looking man 10 years from now.

01:28:03.152 --> 01:28:05.274
I might even like you better.

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.773
I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:28:09.366 --> 01:28:11.275
That's all, brother.

01:28:17.582 --> 01:28:20.287
This is where you live, beautiful.
Not me.

01:28:22.462 --> 01:28:25.913
Lend me your car for a while?
I'll send it back.

01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:28.049
Where are you going?

01:28:31.095 --> 01:28:32.423
Brooklyn, James.

01:28:32.846 --> 01:28:36.262
Cinderella wants to take
another peek at the ashes.

01:29:28.899 --> 01:29:29.931
Hello, Pop.

01:29:30.734 --> 01:29:32.608
Well, Rusty.

01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:35.063
Thought I heard a noise down here...

01:29:35.239 --> 01:29:39.283
but I didn't know it was
that big noise, Rusty Parker.

01:29:42.204 --> 01:29:44.161
How are things, Pop?

01:29:45.665 --> 01:29:49.663
I imagine Danny's gotten along
all right without me, hasn't he?

01:29:50.253 --> 01:29:51.996
He said he could.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.125
- Has he?
- I wouldn't know.

01:29:57.301 --> 01:29:59.970
He closed the place up
and went away...

01:30:00.137 --> 01:30:02.379
right after you left.

01:30:04.642 --> 01:30:05.673
Where is he?

01:30:06.143 --> 01:30:09.263
Him and Genius is entertaining
at Army camps.

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:13.565
I see.

01:30:17.153 --> 01:30:20.487
Well, you needn't look at me
like I'd done something.

01:30:20.657 --> 01:30:23.278
He closed the place down,
I didn't.

01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:24.946
Didn't you?

01:30:50.477 --> 01:30:52.350
Give me a drink.

01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:55.688
- You've had too many now.
- So I've had too many.

01:30:55.857 --> 01:30:58.774
- Give me another one.
- If you say so.

01:30:58.943 --> 01:31:01.232
Certainly I say so.

01:31:03.239 --> 01:31:06.939
And I'm a very big noise,
don't you know that?

01:31:07.117 --> 01:31:09.276
You've got to run when I say so.

01:31:09.912 --> 01:31:14.123
- The toast of the town, huh, Rusty?
- That's right.

01:31:17.252 --> 01:31:20.668
But to you, I'm only a crumb,
is that it, Joe?

01:31:20.839 --> 01:31:23.590
Go ahead, say it.

01:31:24.008 --> 01:31:27.591
You're thinking it.
What's the difference?

01:31:32.016 --> 01:31:33.475
You're thinking it.

01:31:37.479 --> 01:31:40.266
You're a friend of Danny's, aren't you?

01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:45.652
Then he told you why
he went away, didn't he?

01:31:46.697 --> 01:31:49.697
To entertain at Army camps.

01:31:50.951 --> 01:31:52.908
Don't let that fool you.

01:31:53.078 --> 01:31:55.403
He was sick of Brooklyn.

01:31:57.290 --> 01:32:00.041
Well, who isn't?

01:32:00.209 --> 01:32:03.210
Rusty! Darling, we've looked
all over the place for you.

01:32:03.379 --> 01:32:05.621
Oh, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

01:32:05.798 --> 01:32:08.882
Sit down. Sit down. Right here.

01:32:09.134 --> 01:32:12.420
These stools are reserved
for my friends.

01:32:12.596 --> 01:32:15.134
- Joe, these are my friends.
- Hello, Joe.

01:32:15.307 --> 01:32:18.142
My friends are sick of Brooklyn too.

01:32:18.518 --> 01:32:20.511
Aren't you sick of Brooklyn?

01:32:20.687 --> 01:32:23.225
Noel got worried
when you didn't send the car back.

01:32:23.398 --> 01:32:24.809
I was scared to death.

01:32:24.983 --> 01:32:28.815
I asked John to help me find you.
I didn't know my way around.

01:32:28.987 --> 01:32:32.521
Joe, give my friends a drink.
Have a drink.

01:32:33.741 --> 01:32:36.410
I was afraid something
might have happened to you.

01:32:36.577 --> 01:32:39.412
Or that you had decided
to stay in Brooklyn.

01:32:41.498 --> 01:32:42.874
Me?

01:32:43.042 --> 01:32:44.868
Stay in Brooklyn?

01:32:48.839 --> 01:32:51.839
Why do you think I'd stay in Brooklyn?

01:32:52.008 --> 01:32:54.499
After all I went through
to get out of it.

01:32:54.678 --> 01:32:59.220
For heaven's sakes, what do you
think I am, a vicious circle?

01:32:59.390 --> 01:33:01.347
Where's your drink?

01:33:01.517 --> 01:33:05.385
Joe, did you know
I was going to get married?

01:33:05.938 --> 01:33:07.267
Did you?

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.064
Did you?

01:33:09.942 --> 01:33:12.267
Well, I am.

01:33:14.029 --> 01:33:15.404
- To you.
- Rusty...

01:33:15.572 --> 01:33:16.901
Certainly.

01:33:17.074 --> 01:33:20.443
This is what I've wanted for me
all my life.

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.404
Isn't it?

01:33:25.123 --> 01:33:26.950
Well...

01:33:28.543 --> 01:33:30.500
I've got it.

01:33:38.511 --> 01:33:41.926
- Pay the man.
- Wait a minute, beautiful.

01:33:43.098 --> 01:33:46.384
That's the first drink
I ever seen that kid take.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.427
You must have made her
awfully happy up there, mister.

01:34:00.573 --> 01:34:02.732
That's why I say,
do you need money?

01:34:02.909 --> 01:34:06.159
See your local finance company.
No questions. No call-makers.

01:34:06.329 --> 01:34:09.246
Just leave your eyeball for security.

01:34:09.415 --> 01:34:12.581
Now, radio station GI presents
a truck-to-truck hookup...

01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:17.081
featuring Red Herring and his
gee-but-they're-grand glee club.

01:34:28.224 --> 01:34:33.681
Put me

01:34:33.855 --> 01:34:39.394
To the test
And I'll climb you the highest mountain

01:34:39.568 --> 01:34:44.147
I'll swim you Radio City

01:34:44.323 --> 01:34:47.656
Fountain

01:34:56.251 --> 01:35:00.545
Put me to the test and I'll get you

01:35:00.714 --> 01:35:05.921
A queen's tiara
Or a pyramid from the hot Sahara

01:35:06.094 --> 01:35:08.133
- What's that?
- Jazz.

01:35:08.304 --> 01:35:12.598
You can dress in sables
At nightclub front tables

01:35:12.767 --> 01:35:18.009
If that is what my lady adores

01:35:18.188 --> 01:35:21.723
My lady adores My lady adores

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.225
Your eyes, your lips
Your gown, your beautiful eyes

01:35:24.403 --> 01:35:26.691
They're driving me mad
I'm going insane

01:35:26.863 --> 01:35:29.650
You beautiful lady
You wonderful lady

01:35:29.824 --> 01:35:31.200
You...

01:35:31.368 --> 01:35:33.858
Sorry.

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:44.620
Test me Put me on my mettle

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:48.290
How would you lik e a snowball
From PopocatÃ©petl?

01:35:48.467 --> 01:35:52.251
How would you lik e some crooning
That's too, too divine?

01:35:52.429 --> 01:35:54.505
We'll lull you with a lullaby

01:35:54.681 --> 01:36:01.182
That's strictly Hawaiian

01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:07.901
Put me to the test

01:36:08.069 --> 01:36:12.197
Mak e your request

01:36:12.365 --> 01:36:16.777
I'll climb the highest mountain
I'll swim the smallest fountain for you

01:36:20.748 --> 01:36:23.748
To the test

01:36:23.917 --> 01:36:27.167
- Boy
- Mak e your request

01:36:27.337 --> 01:36:30.836
- Hawaiian poi, boy
- I'll go to the Sahara

01:36:31.007 --> 01:36:32.964
I'll get a queen's tiara

01:36:35.595 --> 01:36:39.639
Oh, murder!
Solid! Jackson! Zoot!

01:36:42.852 --> 01:36:45.343
First I promise you
I'll climb the highest mountain

01:36:45.521 --> 01:36:47.976
Then for you I'll swim
The Radio City fountain

01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:50.639
Though I'm scared of height
And I can't even float

01:36:50.818 --> 01:36:53.190
Just put me to the test
And here's what else I'll do quote

01:36:53.362 --> 01:36:56.149
Get a snowball right from PopocatÃ©petl

01:36:56.323 --> 01:36:58.730
I'll be Hansel if you'll be my Gretel

01:36:58.909 --> 01:37:03.155
If we can't please you
Then perhaps my clarinet'll

01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:06.580
- Why don't you put me
- Why don't you put me to the test, babe

01:37:06.749 --> 01:37:09.501
I'll do the rest, babe
Mak e your request, babe

01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:12.207
Anything your heart desires

01:37:12.422 --> 01:37:14.794
- An orange from Pomona
- A bronc from Arizona

01:37:14.966 --> 01:37:17.373
- Or a Hansel and a Gretel
- Snow from PopocatÃ©petl

01:37:17.551 --> 01:37:20.422
- All of this?
- All of this is...

01:37:20.638 --> 01:37:23.473
A mountain or a fountain
Or a solid murder, Jackson, or a...

01:37:25.559 --> 01:37:29.888
Is yours

01:37:44.619 --> 01:37:47.240
Pardon me, may I have the next dance?

01:37:47.413 --> 01:37:49.405
No, thanks.
I'm sitting this one out.

01:37:49.582 --> 01:37:52.037
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

01:37:52.835 --> 01:37:54.578
What are you trying to do, you...?

01:37:54.753 --> 01:37:56.580
- Lady present.
- Lady?

01:37:57.172 --> 01:37:58.999
- Ladies?
- Where?

01:37:59.174 --> 01:38:01.926
- Where's the lady?
- There she is. Over there.

01:38:03.011 --> 01:38:04.968
Oh, there she is again.

01:38:05.138 --> 01:38:08.139
Relax. You ain't even
in her world, sad sack.

01:38:08.308 --> 01:38:11.095
- I can dream, can't I?
- Wake up. She's getting married.

01:38:11.269 --> 01:38:13.261
I read it in the paper.

01:38:20.778 --> 01:38:22.153
Enter, my lord. Enter.

01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:24.314
What have we here?
A tavern?

01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:26.482
A likely place, my lord.
A likely place.

01:38:26.658 --> 01:38:30.822
- I'll wager the coffee is rancid.
- True, my lord. True.

01:38:30.996 --> 01:38:32.027
Joe, how are you?

01:38:32.205 --> 01:38:35.123
Am I glad to see you birds.
Where you been anyway?

01:38:35.292 --> 01:38:37.368
Military secret.

01:38:38.628 --> 01:38:40.953
- The boys look pretty good?
- Plenty good.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:44.831
Look at them, and you won't worry about
who'll be boss over there.

01:38:45.009 --> 01:38:46.966
- Well, give out.
- What'll you have?

01:38:47.136 --> 01:38:50.090
Oysters!
What do we generally have?

01:38:50.264 --> 01:38:52.007
Just the two of you?

01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:56.223
Did you bring anyone with you, Genius?

01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:58.516
No.

01:38:59.022 --> 01:39:00.814
Oysters!

01:39:01.024 --> 01:39:02.056
Good old Joe.

01:39:02.234 --> 01:39:05.982
He's bald. He's fat. He says "pearls."
He says "oysters." I love him.

01:39:06.154 --> 01:39:07.779
You know? I love him too.

01:39:07.948 --> 01:39:08.979
- You know why?
- Why?

01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:10.865
Because he's dumber than me.

01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:14.153
- Dumber than I.
- Okay. He's dumber than both of us.

01:39:14.329 --> 01:39:15.906
Here we are.

01:39:16.164 --> 01:39:18.370
Well, Joe, here we go again.

01:39:21.794 --> 01:39:23.952
You wanna kill the magic?

01:39:25.673 --> 01:39:28.424
Come on, pearl.

01:39:31.595 --> 01:39:34.264
Well, Joe, what do you hear
about anybody?

01:39:34.431 --> 01:39:36.507
Rusty, Danny?

01:39:38.518 --> 01:39:41.091
Okay, what do you hear
about the little redhead?

01:39:41.271 --> 01:39:44.936
- She's moved. You know where?
- And if I did...

01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:46.608
she's moving again.

01:39:46.776 --> 01:39:49.896
She's getting married.
Tonight, Danny.

01:39:53.908 --> 01:39:55.865
Tonight?

01:39:57.912 --> 01:39:59.406
Hey, Danny, you found it.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:03.411
- Found what?
- The pearl, Danny. You found the pearl!

01:40:13.635 --> 01:40:16.090
- Nice timing.
- I told you it was a fake.

01:40:18.056 --> 01:40:19.598
Sure you did.

01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:24.384
- Give me a cup of coffee, will you, Joe?
- Right, Danny.

01:40:36.365 --> 01:40:39.864
You see, I'm a genius at everything
but minding my own business.

01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:43.735
Rusty ought to have that pearl
after looking for it for six months.

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:47.247
If she's gonna marry anybody but Danny,
she'll need all the luck she can get.

01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:49.742
- McGuire know you came here?
- Oh, no.

01:40:49.919 --> 01:40:52.457
He'd kick my teeth in
if he knew I came here.

01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:56.330
Danny's got it figured out
that Rusty's happy with what she's got.

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:58.548
He don't wanna mess it up.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:01.755
- Is she happy?
- Oh, she's very happy.

01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.382
She lost 10 pounds,
but, of course, it's very becoming.

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:09.603
If she thinks about it too much,
she can go out and get a little tight...

01:41:09.771 --> 01:41:12.096
which she's doing quite often lately.

01:41:13.191 --> 01:41:17.438
You probably know what you're doing.
That was a swell thing those kids had.

01:41:17.612 --> 01:41:20.945
I'm glad I'm not the one that broke it up.
I couldn't sleep nights.

01:41:21.115 --> 01:41:23.108
Danny will be wondering where I went.

01:41:23.284 --> 01:41:27.234
If Pearl there is on her toes,
she'll take care of this some way.

01:41:27.413 --> 01:41:31.197
How can I get out without passing
those people? I'm a back-door character.

01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:35.207
Take the door on the left, Genius,
and thanks for coming.

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.499
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

01:41:44.804 --> 01:41:47.295
Well, mastermind?

01:41:47.474 --> 01:41:50.344
- What can I do now?
- Don't be so stubborn!

01:41:50.518 --> 01:41:53.638
You've made a mistake. Admit it.
You've still got time.

01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:09.569
Aren't you even superstitious?

01:42:09.745 --> 01:42:14.038
That pearl's magic. You're liable
to be struck dead or something.

01:42:14.374 --> 01:42:16.532
What pearl's magic?

01:42:18.086 --> 01:42:19.628
This one.

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:22.124
Where did you get this?

01:42:22.298 --> 01:42:24.587
A person by the name of Genius
brought it.

01:42:24.759 --> 01:42:28.377
Said a person by the name of Danny
found it tonight.

01:42:28.638 --> 01:42:30.713
Danny's at Joe's.

01:42:33.559 --> 01:42:37.852
I've never seen such a
silly-looking pearl in all my life.

01:42:39.314 --> 01:42:42.315
- It's all lopsided.
- If it's silly, why are you crying?

01:42:42.484 --> 01:42:44.607
I'm not crying.

01:42:45.195 --> 01:42:50.106
I'm crying because I always cry
when people are getting married.

01:42:50.283 --> 01:42:52.359
Getting married's awful.

01:42:52.535 --> 01:42:54.860
Who ever thought of it
in the first place?

01:42:55.496 --> 01:42:58.201
Well, we're almost there.

01:42:58.374 --> 01:43:00.781
Danny's leaving again tonight.

01:43:01.836 --> 01:43:06.213
Oh, but I can't run away now.

01:43:06.382 --> 01:43:07.959
Not at the last minute.

01:43:08.467 --> 01:43:10.839
Your grandmother could, and did.

01:43:11.011 --> 01:43:14.131
What's the matter,
your family getting soft?

01:43:14.347 --> 01:43:17.384
- My grandmother?
- Go on. Tell her.

01:43:17.559 --> 01:43:21.224
Her grandmother got her into this.
It's up to her to get her out.

01:43:21.396 --> 01:43:23.435
She ran away from me, Rusty.

01:43:23.606 --> 01:43:26.144
At the very last minute.

01:43:26.401 --> 01:43:28.476
In this same room.

01:43:28.653 --> 01:43:30.729
To this same music.

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.531
But she didn't belong with me.

01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:40.616
She belonged to her piano-playing boy
who had the right things to give her.

01:43:40.789 --> 01:43:43.410
Just as you belong to Danny.

01:43:43.583 --> 01:43:46.205
I managed to k eep him away
from the wedding...

01:43:46.378 --> 01:43:51.419
but just closing the door didn't shut
him out, because I made a mistak e.

01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:53.833
I forgot to hide the piano.

01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:56.003
When she saw that...

01:43:56.346 --> 01:43:59.512
well, she didn't hear
the "Wedding March" anymore.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.343
She only heard their music...

01:44:03.144 --> 01:44:06.144
that I could never learn to play.

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.772
Dearly beloved, we have gathered
together here in the sight of God...

01:44:11.944 --> 01:44:13.770
and in the presence of this company...

01:44:13.946 --> 01:44:18.691
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

01:44:18.992 --> 01:44:21.946
Wilt thou, Noel, have this woman
to thy wedded wife...

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.955
so long as ye both shall live?

01:44:25.248 --> 01:44:26.279
I will.

01:44:26.457 --> 01:44:29.826
And wilt thou, Rusty,
have this man to...?

01:44:30.002 --> 01:44:31.200
L...

01:44:31.671 --> 01:44:33.912
I'm afraid not.

01:44:34.173 --> 01:44:36.711
Thank you very much, but...

01:44:37.343 --> 01:44:40.794
my grandmother had the happiest life
of any woman ever...

01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:43.177
because she went back
to Danny. See?

01:44:43.348 --> 01:44:47.512
I mean, she went back
where I belong and...

01:44:47.686 --> 01:44:52.762
It wouldn't even be nice if I got married
to you with this pearl in my hand.

01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:57.270
It's got a silly shape,
but it's very magic, Noel.

01:44:57.445 --> 01:45:00.730
And we'd probably be struck dead, and...

01:45:01.365 --> 01:45:03.691
My grandmother was so happy.

01:45:06.912 --> 01:45:08.157
Well...

01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:12.162
I can't risk getting struck dead,
can I?

01:45:13.210 --> 01:45:17.504
I think you'd better take that thing
and get out of here before it goes off.

01:45:17.673 --> 01:45:18.953
It looks loaded to me.

01:45:20.675 --> 01:45:23.961
- Goodbye, beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.

01:45:24.179 --> 01:45:27.382
Oh! Thank you. Thank you.

01:45:40.152 --> 01:45:45.193
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

01:45:45.365 --> 01:45:48.236
Just one look

01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:54.448
And then I knew

01:45:54.624 --> 01:45:59.665
That all I...

01:46:09.722 --> 01:46:13.340
Let's keep on singing,
"Make way for tomorrow!"

01:46:13.517 --> 01:46:17.100
The sun is bringing
A new day tomorrow

01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:21.185
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown

01:46:21.358 --> 01:46:24.892
Stand up and win! Turn About!
Don't give in! Let's give out!

01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:28.521
To the blues, just refuse to surrender

01:46:28.698 --> 01:46:32.281
One smile and you
Are a true solid sender

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:36.496
What if it rains and it pours?
It only rains out of doors

01:46:36.664 --> 01:46:38.372
Let every frown disappear

01:46:38.541 --> 01:46:40.249
And you'll find

01:46:40.418 --> 01:46:44.415
That tomorrow's

01:46:44.588 --> 01:46:48.206
Here
