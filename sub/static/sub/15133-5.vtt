WEBVTT

00:00.975 --> 00:03.476
If you bring'em the right song,
you'll be famous.

00:05.921 --> 00:07.821
Previously on <i>Smash...</i>

00:07.823 --> 00:10.824
I want you
to meet the songwriter.

00:10.826 --> 00:13.677
I think <i>Hit list</i> might be
quite a good title, don't you?

00:13.679 --> 00:15.763
I'll get the beers while Jimmy
plays you some songs.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.015
On it.

00:19.434 --> 00:22.019
Aren't you committed
to <i>Bombshell?</i>

00:22.021 --> 00:24.504
I got the part.
I am Cecile.

00:24.506 --> 00:26.506
<i>Bombshell...</i>
It's not a Broadway musical.

00:26.508 --> 00:27.558
Excuse me?

00:27.560 --> 00:28.892
Was good,
but it wasn't right.

00:28.894 --> 00:30.894
- What the hell does that mean?
- We should go away.

00:30.896 --> 00:32.846
I'll rent us a car.
We can get this thing done.

00:32.848 --> 00:35.032
<i>Bombshell's</i> free.
You're going to Broadway.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.483
There was just
one condition...

00:36.485 --> 00:38.402
That I step down
as producer.

00:38.404 --> 00:41.622
But there is one person
who is willing to step in.

00:46.294 --> 00:48.145
I can't believe
I'm not allowed to attend.

00:48.147 --> 00:50.130
I mean, it's a reading,
for God's sakes.

00:50.132 --> 00:51.365
Eileen.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.900
Well, none of the cast
are going to be there.

00:52.902 --> 00:54.084
No one will notice.

00:54.086 --> 00:55.652
I'm not the one
who made the ruling.

00:55.654 --> 00:57.287
And I'm not the one
who told the feds the truth

00:57.289 --> 00:58.705
when she didn't have to.

00:58.707 --> 01:01.775
Some people still place
a high value on integrity.

01:01.777 --> 01:03.760
And I respect that.

01:03.762 --> 01:05.546
But what that also means

01:05.548 --> 01:08.715
is that while the new draft
of <i>Bombshell</i> is being read,

01:08.717 --> 01:10.534
you and your integrity

01:10.536 --> 01:12.436
will be having tea
at the mandarin.

01:12.438 --> 01:15.322
I made the reservation
for you myself.

01:15.324 --> 01:18.742
Sometimes I think you
enjoy this a little too much...

01:18.744 --> 01:21.595
Me on the sidelines,
powerless.

01:21.597 --> 01:24.264
You could never
be powerless.

01:24.266 --> 01:28.852
You're just
no longer the producer.

01:28.854 --> 01:31.205
Liz?

01:31.207 --> 01:32.873
I'm going to go see Nick.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.193
I'll be back
after visiting hours are over.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.714
The Belasco...

01:40.716 --> 01:44.384
Home of great hopes
and crushing failures.

01:44.386 --> 01:46.503
And now <i>Bombshell.</i>

01:46.505 --> 01:48.121
Where's Julia?

01:48.123 --> 01:49.790
I thought she was going to meet
us for the walk-through.

01:49.792 --> 01:52.075
- Perfect.
- Oy, get off the stage.

01:52.077 --> 01:54.228
Look, I just want to see
if it'll fit.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.179
- If what will fit?
- Oh.

01:56.181 --> 01:58.699
Possible new number
we came up with

01:58.701 --> 02:00.234
for the top of act two.

02:00.236 --> 02:01.602
The entr'acte swells,

02:01.604 --> 02:04.004
and the curtain rises
on Marilyn's plane

02:04.006 --> 02:05.856

[Sighs] My God, it's going
to look incredible in here.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.631
And this brilliant idea...
Is it in Julia's new draft?

05:01.633 --> 05:03.950
As far as I know.

05:03.952 --> 05:05.936
- Ah, she can tell us herself.
- Hi.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.370
Sorry we're late.

05:07.372 --> 05:10.156
<i>Public relations</i>
is in the show, right?

05:10.158 --> 05:11.725
I guess I would know that

05:11.727 --> 05:14.461
if I'd gotten
a script yesterday...

05:14.463 --> 05:15.796
We had the car
all packed.

05:15.798 --> 05:17.514
And then we came up
with this amazing end

05:17.516 --> 05:19.933
to act one,
so we just decided...

05:19.935 --> 05:22.102
To stay one more night
and put it in.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.804
Cutting each other off,
calling each other "we"...

05:23.806 --> 05:25.455
It's almost adorable.

05:25.457 --> 05:27.307
Okay, here's an idea.

05:27.309 --> 05:29.259
Let's just jump to the part
I care about, all right?

05:29.261 --> 05:30.393
Have you got
a brilliant book

05:30.395 --> 05:31.878
for the read-through
this afternoon?

05:31.880 --> 05:33.814
- There is.
- Good.

05:33.816 --> 05:35.365
Usually
you're a complete wreck

05:35.367 --> 05:36.399
before a reading.

05:36.401 --> 05:37.601
What gives?

05:37.603 --> 05:39.586
She has absolutely
no reason to be nervous.

05:39.588 --> 05:40.720
Oh, you should be.

05:40.722 --> 05:42.405
Jerry's made it
perfectly clear

05:42.407 --> 05:43.774
that he's got no problem
pulling the plug

05:43.776 --> 05:45.392
if this doesn't go
flawlessly.

05:45.394 --> 05:48.061
We can't afford
for you to stumble again,

05:48.063 --> 05:51.665
and neither
can your career.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.367
Tom, should we go
and check the fly space?

05:59.524 --> 06:01.458
- Maybe we should postpone...
- Hmm.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.226
Just give it
one last look

06:03.228 --> 06:04.544
to make sure
that everything's there.

06:04.546 --> 06:06.696
There's the Julia
Tom was talking about.

06:06.698 --> 06:08.265
Don't worry.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.800
You did great work.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.052
It's going to exceed
their expectations.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.386
What about
the Liz Taylor sequence?

06:13.388 --> 06:15.321
I know you wanted me
to put it in, and I didn't.

06:15.323 --> 06:16.606
And you were right
not to.

06:16.608 --> 06:17.757
Trust your instincts,
Julia.

06:17.759 --> 06:19.176
I trust mine.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.178
I know your name's
on the line.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.297
I stand behind
what you did 100%.

06:24.299 --> 06:26.166
Okay.

06:30.087 --> 06:33.423
You know, in the 21st century,
you can call a guy.

06:33.425 --> 06:34.808
Not without good reason.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.526
It'll look like I care
about what happened.

06:36.528 --> 06:38.912
You do. It's all
you've talked about all week.

06:38.914 --> 06:42.215
It's not like I want to.
I just can't stop myself.

06:42.217 --> 06:45.785
[Cell phone ringing]
Oh.

06:45.787 --> 06:47.621
Ah.

06:47.623 --> 06:49.623
- Hello, Derek.
- Guess where I am...

06:49.625 --> 06:51.691
Your future theater.

06:51.693 --> 06:53.426
I can't believe
it's finally happening.

06:53.428 --> 06:55.261
Well,
let's hope it is.

06:55.263 --> 06:57.164
If the read-through
is a bust this afternoon,

06:57.166 --> 06:58.498
I'm not sure
where we're going to be.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.016
Right,
the read-through.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.318
Sure you still don't
want me?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.320
No, we just need
to hear it clean, you know...

07:03.322 --> 07:06.006
A couple of random readers
and the creative team's ears.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.440
If it doesn't work
in that room,

07:07.442 --> 07:08.992
then all the money in the world
isn't going to save it.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.743
How are our boys
getting along?

07:10.745 --> 07:13.013
- I haven't heard from them.
- Only 'cause she won't call.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.731
You know, a lot of people
have been asking about them

07:14.733 --> 07:15.765
since Ronnie's concert.

07:15.767 --> 07:16.867
We need to take advantage
of that.

07:16.869 --> 07:17.869
How?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.019
Well, I have a friend

07:19.021 --> 07:21.721
who runs
the winter fringe festival.

07:21.723 --> 07:23.757
I persuaded her
to give <i>Hit list</i> a slot.

07:23.759 --> 07:25.225
You have time
for something like that

07:25.227 --> 07:26.292
with <i>Bombshell</i> where it is?

07:26.294 --> 07:28.061
Eh, the fringe
isn't a big commitment.

07:28.063 --> 07:29.613
It's just a place to throw up
a work in progress

07:29.615 --> 07:31.498
and see how it plays
for a few days.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.367
You're hedging your ts
in case Julia doesn't deliver.

07:34.369 --> 07:36.753
Yeah, just tell them
the news, all right?

07:36.755 --> 07:39.022
- Okay.
- See you later.

07:39.024 --> 07:43.393
Something tells me you just
found your good reason to call.

07:43.395 --> 07:45.545
Mama, he was merely
being friendly.

07:45.547 --> 07:48.048
Am I not allowed to speak
to an old family friend?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.866
Okay, everyone,
we're going to break here.

07:49.868 --> 07:50.901
Uh, we just got word.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.970
Terry Falls
is on his way up.

07:53.972 --> 07:56.623
Well, well, Terry Falls
is finally gracing us

07:56.625 --> 07:58.091
with his presence.

07:58.093 --> 08:01.094
We've only been rehearsing
a week without him.

08:01.096 --> 08:02.562
He's a big movie star.

08:02.564 --> 08:03.980
If it wasn't for him,

08:03.982 --> 08:05.515
<i>Liaisons</i> would never have
gotten a revival.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.918
I know.
But with him as Valmont...

08:07.920 --> 08:10.287
That's like hiring Jim Carrey
to play king lear.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I please introduce

08:13.041 --> 08:15.625
<i>Liaison's</i> Vicomte de Valmont,
Terry Falls.

08:15.627 --> 08:20.780
[Applause]

08:20.782 --> 08:24.084
It is an honor and privilege
to be here.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.253
Please, please, please,
forgive my delay.

08:26.255 --> 08:30.407
I assure you,
I will integrate smoothly.

28:28.819 --> 28:32.270
No matter what treachery
made it so.

28:32.272 --> 28:35.507
My fullness was my joy,

28:35.509 --> 28:37.309
and now,
for it all to end,

28:37.311 --> 28:41.930
and to be left with your sneers
and your jokes...

28:41.932 --> 28:45.634
You are a monster,
Valmont.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.686
Please leave me be.

28:57.280 --> 29:03.235
[Indistinct chatter]

29:05.555 --> 29:09.508
[Sighs]
When he showed me the pages,

29:09.510 --> 29:12.511
I just... I guess I wanted it
to be good so badly,

29:12.513 --> 29:14.863
I convinced myself it was,
you know?

29:14.865 --> 29:17.516
The ideas are really good.
I can see why you felt that way.

29:17.518 --> 29:18.700
Plus, he's Kyle.

29:18.702 --> 29:20.452
I mean, he's been eating
and sleeping this stuff

29:20.454 --> 29:22.421
since he was a kid.
[Cell phone ringing]

29:22.423 --> 29:24.106
I just assumed that he knew
something I didn't.

29:24.108 --> 29:27.059
Oh, God.
Derek.

29:27.061 --> 29:29.578
He's probably calling to see why
I haven't sent him a copy yet.

29:29.580 --> 29:32.414
What are you going
to tell him?

29:32.416 --> 29:34.633
- Karen?
- I...

29:34.635 --> 29:37.052
I haven't sent you the script
yet because we have to...

29:37.054 --> 29:39.388
That's not
why I'm calling.

29:39.390 --> 29:42.874
We just finished
the <i>Bombshell</i> reading.

29:42.876 --> 29:44.009
It was amazing.

29:44.011 --> 29:46.528
- Really?
- Yep.

29:46.530 --> 29:47.912
Get ready, darling.

29:47.914 --> 29:50.599
If we get this right,
you'll win every award in town.

29:50.601 --> 29:52.768
<i>Hit list</i> can wait.

29:52.770 --> 29:54.403
I want you to focus
on <i>Bombshell</i> now, okay?

29:54.405 --> 29:56.405
[Knocking on window]

29:56.407 --> 29:59.775
Look, I've got to go.
[Sighs]

30:06.983 --> 30:08.700
It's over, isn't it?

30:33.690 --> 30:35.190
Hi.

30:36.916 --> 30:40.118
I-I was just wondering
if you needed anything.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.587
How did you do it?

30:42.589 --> 30:46.291
You were so raw,
so connected.

30:46.293 --> 30:50.211
You moved an entire room
with just your voice,

30:50.213 --> 30:51.679
and there I was...

30:51.681 --> 30:52.897
[Affected French accent]
"No, my dear,

30:52.899 --> 30:54.649
most pantomimes
are far more amusing."

30:54.651 --> 30:56.251
[Blows raspberry]

30:56.253 --> 30:58.269
[Normal voice]
I mean it. How did you do it?

30:58.271 --> 31:00.221
Well...

31:00.223 --> 31:02.791
You know how scary
performing is.

31:05.327 --> 31:06.461
Not really.

31:06.463 --> 31:08.446
Well, you should,

31:08.448 --> 31:11.916
'cause if you're not scared,
the work won't be good.

31:13.669 --> 31:16.638
I'm never scared...

31:16.640 --> 31:17.989
About anything.

31:17.991 --> 31:20.175
Well, that's not true.

31:20.177 --> 31:22.210
You're obviously scared
to do this show

31:22.212 --> 31:24.446
the way it was
originally intended,

31:24.448 --> 31:26.581
and you should.

31:26.583 --> 31:27.899
It's terrifying.

31:27.901 --> 31:31.953
But that fear
can transform you...

31:31.955 --> 31:34.556
If you just let yourself
feel it.

31:37.126 --> 31:39.227
Feel it, huh?

31:39.229 --> 31:42.296
Every moment.

31:42.298 --> 31:44.399
Hmm.

31:47.703 --> 31:50.138
[Sighs] If you want
to blame me, you should.

31:50.140 --> 31:52.824
I pushed for this.
I never asked if you were ready.

31:52.826 --> 31:54.642
I thought I was.

31:54.644 --> 31:57.495
That's the problem.

31:57.497 --> 31:59.797
How can you be so bad
at something

31:59.799 --> 32:01.182
that you love so much?

32:01.184 --> 32:03.451
- This was your first try.
- [Scoffs] No.

32:03.453 --> 32:06.037
I don't have it.

32:06.039 --> 32:07.972
You and Jimmy do.
You had it from birth.

32:07.974 --> 32:09.257
I don't.

32:09.259 --> 32:10.591
I didn't have it.

32:10.593 --> 32:12.710
I had to work for it,
hard...

32:12.712 --> 32:14.929
Singing lessons, dance lessons,
acting classes.

32:14.931 --> 32:17.098
You can't just expect
to wake up one day

32:17.100 --> 32:18.950
and write the next great
American musical.

32:18.952 --> 32:22.570
Jimmy could.

32:22.572 --> 32:26.975
Wouldn't it have been awesome
if I could too?

32:32.147 --> 32:35.466
[Buzzer]

32:35.468 --> 32:37.251
They turned me away
this morning.

32:37.253 --> 32:40.321
Was that a mistake?

32:40.323 --> 32:43.057
It wasn't.
I told them to.

32:43.059 --> 32:44.792
Why?

32:44.794 --> 32:47.595
They're moving me upstate
next week.

32:47.597 --> 32:49.197
- So?
- "So?"

32:49.199 --> 32:52.050
I know you... you're going to
drive eight hours in a hailstorm

32:52.052 --> 32:54.369
just to make sure
that I'm okay.

32:54.371 --> 32:57.071
Yes, that's true.

33:01.343 --> 33:03.211
You're an amazing woman,

33:03.213 --> 33:07.048
and I don't want you to waste
one ounce of your time

33:07.050 --> 33:09.250
waiting for me.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.204
I'm sorry.

33:15.541 --> 33:17.609
I'm sorry too.

33:22.731 --> 33:25.183
Listen, I've been
in so many readings

33:25.185 --> 33:27.885
that went way worse
than that.

33:27.887 --> 33:29.671
I don't see
how that's possible.

33:29.673 --> 33:31.539
[Chuckles]
Oh, my God.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.391
The one that took place
on the subway,

33:33.393 --> 33:35.376
but it was
actually purgatory

33:35.378 --> 33:38.930
or the one where U.S. soldiers
switched bodies with Iraqis.

33:38.932 --> 33:40.448
And don't even
get me started

33:40.450 --> 33:43.251
on <i>Towering inferno</i>
The musical.

33:45.921 --> 33:48.573
You really care
about Kyle, don't you?

33:48.575 --> 33:50.808
He's my family.

33:52.711 --> 33:55.463
You know, you're not
as bad a guy as you try to seem.

33:55.465 --> 33:57.715
Thanks.
[Scoffs]

33:57.717 --> 33:59.601
But even if you're
just a little bad,

33:59.603 --> 34:02.837
could you maybe leave Karen
out of it?

34:02.839 --> 34:04.088
Excuse me?

34:04.090 --> 34:05.723
She's
a really special person,

34:05.725 --> 34:07.442
and she's been
through a lot this year.

34:07.444 --> 34:10.244
So work together, sure,

34:10.246 --> 34:12.530
but...
Don't toy with her, okay?

34:17.219 --> 34:19.704
Julia, what we just heard
is a major accomplishment,

34:19.706 --> 34:21.889
an artistic triumph.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.541
I'm not going
to produce it.

34:23.543 --> 34:25.677
- Excuse me?
- You're out of your mind.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.011
Were we
at the same reading?

34:27.013 --> 34:28.362
That is some of
the best writing for a musical

34:28.364 --> 34:29.429
I've heard in years.

34:29.431 --> 34:31.616
I agree,
but it's not Broadway.

34:31.618 --> 34:34.252
Look, I'm a producer.
I want to make money.

34:34.254 --> 34:35.837
And this version
might win some awards,

34:35.839 --> 34:37.922
but it's not going to put asses
in the seats

34:37.924 --> 34:39.956
for years and years
to come,

34:39.958 --> 34:41.793
and that's
what I'm interested in.

34:41.795 --> 34:43.444
You're actually suggesting

34:43.446 --> 34:45.446
that this is too good
for Broadway.

34:45.447 --> 34:49.283
<i>Follies, Grey gardens,</i>
<i>Ragtime,</i>

34:49.284 --> 34:50.985
<i>Sunday in the park</i>
<i>with George...</i>

34:50.987 --> 34:52.136
Oh, God.

34:52.138 --> 34:54.088
They didn't recoup
their investment.

34:54.090 --> 34:56.891
Look, if you want to take it
to the public theater,

34:56.893 --> 34:59.243
I won't stand in the way.
[Laughs]

34:59.245 --> 35:00.495
As for the Belasco,

35:00.497 --> 35:03.548
this version will not appear
on that stage.

35:03.550 --> 35:05.366
If Eileen
could hear you now...

35:05.368 --> 35:06.718
She'd agree with me.

35:06.720 --> 35:09.187
I seriously doubt that.

35:09.189 --> 35:11.823
So you would rather
not produce <i>Bombshell</i>

35:11.825 --> 35:13.408
than produce this version?

35:13.410 --> 35:16.961
I have every intention
of producing <i>Bombshell.</i>

35:16.963 --> 35:19.580
I have a version
that I love,

35:19.582 --> 35:21.916
and that's the one
I intend to use.

35:21.918 --> 35:23.250
My contract
clearly states

35:23.252 --> 35:25.470
that you cannot use
anyone else's work but mine

35:25.472 --> 35:26.637
unless I let you.

35:26.639 --> 35:28.422
I'm not using
anyone else's work.

35:28.424 --> 35:30.058
I'm using yours.

35:30.060 --> 35:33.144
Oh, my God.

35:33.146 --> 35:35.947
That's the workshop draft
from seven months ago.

35:35.949 --> 35:37.281
How did you get this?

35:37.283 --> 35:41.119
He sent it to me
last week.

35:49.075 --> 35:51.591
I didn't even remember
send it to Jerry

35:51.617 --> 35:53.792
a week ago, when
he came on board,

35:53.812 --> 35:55.845
he asked to see
all the drafts.

35:55.847 --> 35:57.531
Did you send them all?

35:57.533 --> 35:59.966
I sent him one,
but it wasn't malicious.

35:59.968 --> 36:01.718
It was just the draft
I liked the most.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.453
You know that...
I haven't been able to stop

36:03.455 --> 36:05.188
talking about it
since I watched it.

36:05.190 --> 36:07.691
Okay...

36:07.693 --> 36:10.093
The workshop
was the first draft.

36:10.095 --> 36:12.546
This is the final one.

36:12.548 --> 36:14.848
I say we get Jerry in here,
and we tell him

36:14.850 --> 36:18.085
that this is
what we are both committed to.

36:18.087 --> 36:20.020
I can't.

36:20.022 --> 36:22.923
You've written an incredibly
rich and layered show

36:22.925 --> 36:24.808
about the men
who created Marilyn,

36:24.810 --> 36:26.259
but I've always
been more interested

36:26.261 --> 36:28.178
in how Marilyn
created herself.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.230
When I stood
on that Broadway stage today,

36:30.232 --> 36:31.848
that's what I saw.

36:31.850 --> 36:34.418
That's the story
I want to tell,

36:34.420 --> 36:37.521
and that's just not what
you and Peter came back with.

36:37.523 --> 36:40.523
All right, children,
we need a decision.

36:40.525 --> 36:45.112
Since I agree with Julia
and you agree with Jerry,

36:45.114 --> 36:46.413
we need a tie breaker.

36:46.415 --> 36:48.415
Who?

36:48.417 --> 36:49.750
Eileen.

36:49.752 --> 36:51.218
Whatever she says goes.

36:51.220 --> 36:52.519
- Absolutely.
- Fine.

36:52.521 --> 36:56.073
Let's go.

36:56.075 --> 36:58.191
- Ivy, I have to talk to you.
- Again?

36:58.193 --> 36:59.526
I've had
a major breakthrough.

36:59.528 --> 37:00.910
Really?
That's wonderful.

37:00.912 --> 37:02.545
Yeah, hearing what you said
about being scared,

37:02.547 --> 37:04.214
no inhibitions,
no barriers,

37:04.216 --> 37:06.533
no, you know, spin...

37:06.535 --> 37:09.970
I knew that's the kind
of dramatic actor I want to be.

37:09.972 --> 37:12.622
So I've decided
to go off my meds.

37:12.624 --> 37:13.824
What?

37:13.826 --> 37:16.526
The Zoloft, the Ambien,
the Adderall,

37:16.528 --> 37:17.611
definitely the lithium.

37:17.613 --> 37:19.996
My God.
Good riddance, lithium, right?

37:19.998 --> 37:23.433
I've been in a 20-year haze
of psychopharmaceuticals,

37:23.435 --> 37:25.152
and, sure, while they
relieve my A.D.D.,

37:25.154 --> 37:27.888
anxiety, mood swings,
psychotic breaks, what have you,

37:27.890 --> 37:31.892
they're cutting me off
from my own humanity,

37:31.894 --> 37:34.578
from feeling every moment.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.079
Uh...

37:36.081 --> 37:38.748
Oh, Ivy,
I am so excited.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.368
I've already started to have
thoughts, impulses, images.

37:41.370 --> 37:43.136
I'm going to be
vibrant again, Ivy.

37:43.138 --> 37:44.988
I am going to feel.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.456
What is love like?
What is hope like?

37:46.458 --> 37:49.893
What is fear like?
What is sex like?

37:49.895 --> 37:52.679
Going down.
Want to come with?

37:54.999 --> 37:57.951
[Elevator Bell dings]

37:57.953 --> 37:59.820
It's just embarrassing.

37:59.822 --> 38:01.838
Your songs are so good,
and my stuff...

38:01.840 --> 38:03.573
Might not be yet,
all right?

38:03.575 --> 38:04.975
There's been plenty of shows

38:04.977 --> 38:06.509
that got better
as they went along.

38:06.511 --> 38:08.011
Yeah, look at <i>Rent</i>
or <i>Next to normal.</i>

38:08.013 --> 38:08.995
Or <i>Bombshell.</i>

38:08.997 --> 38:10.980
But if I hadn't messed up,

38:10.982 --> 38:12.399
then we would be
at the fringe

38:12.401 --> 38:13.750
with Derek directing
in two weeks.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.302
So we miss out
on this opportunity, all right?

38:15.304 --> 38:16.770
We'll get
the next one.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.822
I just wish the whole show
could be your songs.

38:18.824 --> 38:21.675
Then we'd be
in good shape.

38:21.677 --> 38:22.992
Why can't it?

38:22.994 --> 38:24.828
What are you talking about?

38:24.830 --> 38:26.530
You just mentioned <i>Rent.</i>

38:26.532 --> 38:27.931
It started
as a book musical,

38:27.933 --> 38:29.534
but by the time it got
to off-Broadway...

38:29.535 --> 38:31.451
The dialogue was gone,
and it was all songs.

38:31.453 --> 38:33.720
Sung through.

38:33.722 --> 38:35.355
Jimmy could write
some new songs

38:35.357 --> 38:37.807
to fill the gaps
where the dialogue used to be.

38:37.809 --> 38:39.459
It's still your story,
Kyle,

38:39.461 --> 38:41.628
and if you work fast enough,
we could still go for fringe.

38:41.630 --> 38:43.780
All we need is
a first act.

38:43.782 --> 38:47.100
I think it could work.
Kyle?

38:49.353 --> 38:50.737
I'll get the book.

38:50.739 --> 38:54.791
Then we'll start thinking
about what songs we need.

38:54.793 --> 38:58.311
Hey, uh, can I... can I talk
to you about something?

38:58.313 --> 39:01.281
I'm going to get
some more booze.

39:03.084 --> 39:05.235
Uh...

39:05.237 --> 39:06.419
I need to talk to you

39:06.421 --> 39:08.338
about what happened
at Ronnie's concert.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.440
You don't have
to say anything.

39:10.442 --> 39:13.777
I know, but I want to.

39:13.779 --> 39:15.962
I'm sorry.

39:15.964 --> 39:18.248
I shouldn't have done that,

39:18.250 --> 39:22.018
especially now that we're
working together, you know?

39:22.020 --> 39:24.921
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

39:24.923 --> 39:27.257
Kyle told me
about your situation.

39:27.259 --> 39:28.808
I didn't know.

39:28.810 --> 39:31.011
Hmm?
My situation?

39:31.013 --> 39:33.263
It's just that...

39:33.265 --> 39:36.599
I usually don't like
a lot of people...

39:36.601 --> 39:38.401
[Chuckles]

39:38.403 --> 39:41.788
And you're pretty cool,
so...

39:41.790 --> 39:45.609
Just don't let me down,
okay?

39:45.611 --> 39:47.894
I won't.

39:55.019 --> 39:58.822
Uh, friends?

39:58.824 --> 40:02.075
S... sure.
Friends.

40:09.133 --> 40:10.734
Are you sure
she's dating Derek?

40:10.736 --> 40:13.036
Because I still don't get
that vibe.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.654
He dates
all his leading ladies.

40:14.656 --> 40:17.173
You know that.

40:17.175 --> 40:18.925
[Sighs]

40:18.927 --> 40:25.115
[Overlapping shouting]

40:30.654 --> 40:33.756
Enough!

40:33.758 --> 40:36.592
After all the bumps in the road,
has it really come to this...

40:36.594 --> 40:41.064
The four of you
unable to reach a consensus?

40:41.066 --> 40:43.650
We've agreed
to let you choose.

40:43.652 --> 40:45.719
You remember
the workshop.

40:45.721 --> 40:47.554
You were
at this reading.

40:47.556 --> 40:49.105
Look,
from an audience standpoint,

40:49.107 --> 40:50.974
what would you spend $200

40:50.976 --> 40:52.909
and give two hours
of your time for?

40:52.911 --> 40:56.429
A sexy, provocative,
insightful musical

40:56.431 --> 40:58.381
about Marilyn
and the men who made her?

40:58.383 --> 41:02.202
Or a lush, dazzling,
still insightful spectacle

41:02.204 --> 41:04.988
about a girl
who became an icon?

41:04.990 --> 41:06.906
It's all you, Eileen.

41:06.908 --> 41:10.860
Whatever you say goes...

41:10.862 --> 41:13.246
As it should be.

41:38.289 --> 41:41.024
Well...

41:41.026 --> 41:43.827
Since it's up to me...
