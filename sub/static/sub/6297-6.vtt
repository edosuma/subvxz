<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:02.064 --> 00:03.832
You were once a stray dog,
Micheletto.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.233
Search out a dozen of them

00:05.301 --> 00:07.435
whom we can school in
the art of vengeance.

00:07.503 --> 00:09.723
Would you keep
secrets from us?

00:09.791 --> 00:12.443
You're a cleric,
not a soldier.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.878
Who pays for such decadence?

00:14.946 --> 00:17.249
Where does your
charity end up?

00:17.316 --> 00:20.115
In the Medici
bank in Florence?

00:20.216 --> 00:22.516
Your Holiness.
Piero di Medici.

00:22.584 --> 00:25.351
Their fervour for the friar's
visions increases daily.

00:25.419 --> 00:28.251
And if they knew of
your personal accounts,

00:28.319 --> 00:30.019
they would burn the
bank to the ground.

00:30.087 --> 00:34.096
Perhaps we had better have our
wealth brought back to Rome.

00:34.164 --> 00:37.099
We must remove him
from this world.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.803
Be the sword of
the apocalypse.

00:39.871 --> 00:42.275
The sword of righteousness.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.679
I would gladly die to rid
the world of the Borgia pope.

00:45.780 --> 00:49.815
It will be a grisly death.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.316
Catherina Sforza,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.654
the pope would request
your beauteous presence

00:53.722 --> 00:55.089
at the chair of St. Peter's.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.392
Who is going to chain me?

00:57.493 --> 00:58.926
You?

00:58.994 --> 01:01.328
My cousin refuses
to debase herself

01:01.396 --> 01:05.397
before that swine that
wears the papal tiara.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.133
Ah!

01:07.201 --> 01:08.934
I promised my
sister your heart!

01:10.905 --> 01:12.306
Murder!

We must atone -
for our sins.

Dust thou art and to

03:26.680 --> 03:31.751
God has spoken to us,
Your Eminences.

03:31.852 --> 03:35.522
We have heard His thunder.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.460
So the greatest penitence
must be ours.

03:41.730 --> 03:45.566
Dust thou art and to
dust shalt thou return.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.118
Bring me some water.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.041
Your Holiness.

04:29.349 --> 04:31.116
<i>A new leaf?</i>

04:31.217 --> 04:32.584
Is it possible?

04:32.685 --> 04:33.886
A new pretence.

04:33.953 --> 04:37.456
A new theatre,
that is all.

04:37.524 --> 04:42.127
Antonello, take note of the man
with the water jug.

04:42.195 --> 04:44.295
He's the pope's taster.

05:07.588 --> 05:10.323
<i>Christ spilled</i>
<i>his blood for us!</i>

05:10.391 --> 05:13.793
<i>We must spill ours for him!</i>

<i>We must scourge our flesh,</i>

05:16.396 --> 05:20.666
<i>wash Florence clean with</i>
<i>the wine of our blood!</i>

05:29.074 --> 05:34.045
Is it good enough to kneel
and say you repent?

05:36.182 --> 05:40.319
<i>Will you carry the mark</i>
<i>of repentance upon you?</i>

05:44.892 --> 05:46.626
Kneel.

05:49.363 --> 05:52.098
Do you repent?
I repent.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.333
Do you repent
all your sins?

05:54.434 --> 05:56.635
I repent all my sins.

05:56.703 --> 05:58.670
<i>Do you give your</i>
<i>life to Christ?</i>

05:58.738 --> 06:01.306
<i>I give my life to Christ.</i>

06:33.838 --> 06:40.378
Are you willing to throw off
your riches, this finery,

06:40.445 --> 06:46.117
this display of
pride and vanity,

06:46.185 --> 06:52.523
and give yourself truly
to the Lord Jesus Christ?

06:52.591 --> 06:53.991
I am ready.

06:55.894 --> 07:02.098
You will dedicate yourself
to the renewal of Christendom.

07:02.199 --> 07:07.470
To the destruction
of the red whore of Rome!

07:12.042 --> 07:14.911
<i>And will the Medici repent,</i>

07:14.979 --> 07:17.714
<i>abandon their</i>
<i>avarice and usury?</i>

07:17.782 --> 07:20.184
<i>Their gold and finery?</i>

07:20.252 --> 07:21.953
<i>If they do not repent,</i>

07:22.020 --> 07:24.355
<i>we will cast them out</i>

07:24.423 --> 07:28.593
<i>as Jesus threw the money</i>
<i>lenders from the temple!</i>

07:28.661 --> 07:32.063
<i>For they have turned</i>
<i>a house of prayer</i>

07:32.131 --> 07:35.467
<i>and made it a den of thieves!</i>

07:37.804 --> 07:41.473
In this bottle
are both Heaven and Hell.

07:45.278 --> 07:49.281
This is the marvel
of the minimal dose.

07:49.382 --> 07:53.652
Too much and it will kill you.

07:53.719 --> 07:57.455
Just enough,
and it will make you strong.

07:59.224 --> 08:00.691
I was poisoned
with cantarella

08:00.759 --> 08:02.827
and I am now
the stronger for it.

08:23.814 --> 08:26.182
Do you have faith?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.652
I have faith.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.055
Then drink.

09:05.256 --> 09:08.291
To whom does the pope confess,
oh Lord?

09:12.297 --> 09:20.405
Who will hear his sins,
wash them clean,

09:20.472 --> 09:25.243
so that he may live
again in Your favour?

09:27.580 --> 09:31.417
Ah.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.319
The great silence.

09:34.854 --> 09:35.887
Oh!

09:35.988 --> 09:38.690
My son.

09:38.758 --> 09:40.225
When did you return?

09:40.292 --> 09:41.892
Within the hour.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.696
Holy Father, I would have
you hear my confession.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.042
I am guilty of the sin
of murder.

09:59.479 --> 10:00.746
And lust.

10:00.847 --> 10:02.982
I am guilty
of the sin of lust.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.951
Violence and fornication.

10:05.019 --> 10:07.520
How often these
two are united.

10:09.223 --> 10:11.191
Go on.

10:11.258 --> 10:13.226
I killed the man
who defiled my sister

10:13.294 --> 10:14.994
and insulted
the name of Borgia.

10:15.095 --> 10:16.462
<i>A knife to the heart.</i>

10:16.530 --> 10:19.099
As we recall, murder
was not your mission!

10:19.200 --> 10:21.701
It was a matter of honour!

10:21.802 --> 10:24.471
And lust, you say.

10:24.538 --> 10:27.340
Was that a matter
of honour too?

10:27.408 --> 10:30.143
Who or what
was the object of this lust?

10:30.210 --> 10:32.278
Catherina Sforza
shared her bed with me.

10:32.346 --> 10:35.715
Oh, of course, who else?

10:37.385 --> 10:44.625
And tell us, after you had
graced her with your-presence,

10:44.693 --> 10:47.095
did she beg to be dragged
to Rome in chains?

10:47.196 --> 10:48.229
No, no.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.564
To be-to be
friends with us?

10:49.665 --> 10:50.965
No, she did not.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.534
But, surely, after
such lavish attention,

10:52.602 --> 10:54.370
she is now our friend.
No!

10:54.437 --> 10:55.904
I fear not, Your Holiness.

10:56.006 --> 10:58.541
She-she remains an enemy.

11:05.383 --> 11:07.585
We have both sinned, my son,

11:07.652 --> 11:11.488
but whose sin will bring
the greatest doom upon us?

11:11.556 --> 11:15.025
Hmm?
Ours or yours?

11:18.696 --> 11:21.030
Ego te absolvo ab
omnnibus censuris

11:21.098 --> 11:22.798
et in nomine Patris et
Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

11:22.866 --> 11:24.300
Amen.

11:30.406 --> 11:32.274
I find it hard to believe.

11:32.342 --> 11:34.009
I send you on
a diplomatic mission

11:34.077 --> 11:35.277
and you start a war!

11:35.345 --> 11:37.579
There is no war.

11:37.647 --> 11:40.115
God struck the Basilica.

11:40.183 --> 11:42.584
He showed His anger to all.

11:42.652 --> 11:45.253
Is now the time to
take a knife in hand?

11:45.321 --> 11:48.123
To have the armies of the
north battering at our gates?

11:48.224 --> 11:50.025
Well then, release me
from my cardinal's robes,

11:50.126 --> 11:51.493
give me the papal army,

11:51.560 --> 11:53.462
and I will bring you
Catherina Sforza in chains!

11:53.529 --> 11:55.663
Armies do not march on air!

11:55.731 --> 11:59.734
We do not have the resources
to send an army north!

11:59.802 --> 12:04.672
And now we are in need
of another alliance!

12:09.211 --> 12:12.947
Perhaps you will explain
so much to your dear sister?

12:13.048 --> 12:14.582
That she must now marry,

12:14.650 --> 12:17.853
in order protect us
from the results of your folly?

12:21.290 --> 12:25.160
Oh Lord, as we remember
Thy 40 days in the wilderness,

12:25.227 --> 12:30.331
so we share in Thy suffering
during this Lenten period.

12:30.399 --> 12:35.369
If we have sullied
Thy name with luxury,

12:35.437 --> 12:38.673
then we beseech
You to forgive us.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.541
And we pray for enlightenment

12:40.609 --> 12:42.243
as to why You chose
to strike with fire

12:42.311 --> 12:45.712
at the heart of Your Church.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.881
Per Christum, Dominum Nostrum.
Amen.

12:47.949 --> 12:50.517
<i>Amen.</i>

12:50.585 --> 12:52.753
During this Lenten period,

12:52.821 --> 12:57.860
instead of taking your repast
in the luxury of your palaces,

12:57.928 --> 13:01.430
you will fast here
with us, in common.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.665
Your Holiness!

13:02.733 --> 13:04.334
Sardines...

13:04.402 --> 13:07.604
...were the traditional
Lenten fare

13:07.672 --> 13:09.439
when we were young.

13:09.540 --> 13:15.411
So we shall dine on sardines.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.414
Your Holiness.
Hmm?

13:18.481 --> 13:20.682
Let me taste.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.884
You think our enemies would
poison our Lenten fare?

13:22.952 --> 13:25.253
These paltry bones?

13:25.321 --> 13:27.755
It is my duty,
your Holiness.

13:38.535 --> 13:40.237
A poisoning would
brighten the proceedings

13:40.304 --> 13:41.972
of an otherwise
gloom-laden day,

13:42.073 --> 13:43.173
would it not?

13:47.078 --> 13:49.513
<i>Well, Brother Bernadino,</i>

13:49.581 --> 13:51.348
are you about to die?

13:51.416 --> 13:53.684
I think not, Your Holiness.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.585
Let us proceed.

13:55.653 --> 13:58.488
Incipit historia Iob.

14:03.794 --> 14:05.161
Give me your voice,
give me your voice,

14:05.229 --> 14:06.963
O God let me hear you.

14:07.031 --> 14:08.932
Let me hear you speak to me.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.668
I want to feel,
feel your spirit inside of me.

14:11.736 --> 14:16.239
From our Holy Father,
Christ's Vicar on Earth,

14:16.307 --> 14:19.075
the Bishop of Rome
and the heir to St. Peter,

14:19.142 --> 14:22.678
a greeting and
apostolic benediction

14:22.746 --> 14:29.552
to his most beloved son,
Girolamo Savonarola.

14:31.221 --> 14:34.324
I am Cardinal Ascanio Sforza.

14:34.391 --> 14:36.459
Vice chancellor.
Indeed.

14:36.527 --> 14:40.096
Then you know all there is
to know about corruption.

14:44.435 --> 14:45.969
His Holiness hears

14:46.037 --> 14:48.538
you are a zealous worker
in God's service,

14:48.639 --> 14:50.140
at which he rejoices,

14:50.207 --> 14:52.508
and is intrigued to
hear that you proclaim

14:52.576 --> 14:55.178
your prophecies proceed
directly from God.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.481
Is this so?

14:58.582 --> 15:01.284
God speaks through me.

15:01.352 --> 15:04.086
I hear His voice.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.557
Of this there is no doubt.

15:07.624 --> 15:11.494
As befits your
vows of obedience,

15:11.562 --> 15:13.796
his Holiness would have
you journey to Rome

15:13.864 --> 15:16.365
to discourse further
with him on this matter.

15:16.433 --> 15:22.272
The Good Lord's lightning not
yet silenced this Borgia pope?

15:22.340 --> 15:25.276
Well, tell him
my work is here,

15:25.344 --> 15:30.648
ridding Florence of its
sodomites and blasphemers.

15:30.749 --> 15:33.050
And my work only will be ended

15:33.118 --> 15:37.955
when the last sodomite
is burning in Hell.

15:38.023 --> 15:43.294
Perhaps a different destiny
awaits you in Rome.

15:43.395 --> 15:45.196
In the Castel Saint Angelo?

15:48.500 --> 15:51.569
No.

15:53.139 --> 15:55.040
In the Vatican.

15:55.107 --> 15:57.843
Oh.

15:57.944 --> 15:59.211
As cardinal.

15:59.312 --> 16:01.680
A seat in Consistory.

16:15.362 --> 16:20.033
No man can put a
price on salvation.

17:05.479 --> 17:08.047
The sleep of the innocent.

17:11.385 --> 17:12.986
I promised you
a heart, Sister.

17:13.087 --> 17:16.190
Whose?
Your own?

17:16.257 --> 17:19.425
I promised you the heart
of Giovanni Sforza

17:19.493 --> 17:22.096
on a dinner plate.

17:22.164 --> 17:26.434
His blood on this knife
will have to suffice.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.676
What does it say of us,
Brother,

17:34.744 --> 17:38.412
that you promise me this
and I would accept?

17:38.480 --> 17:40.814
Do you accept?

17:44.151 --> 17:47.120
I would rather have
my innocence back.

17:47.188 --> 17:50.790
Be as I was before I
married that vile man.

17:50.891 --> 17:53.260
Impossible, I am afraid.

17:53.328 --> 17:55.161
For either of us.

17:55.229 --> 17:59.900
Prime has been sung,
Terce approaches,

17:59.968 --> 18:03.370
yet some have barely
roused their souls.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.310
Oh, darkness into light.

18:09.378 --> 18:11.012
Father,
Giovanni is sleeping.

18:11.113 --> 18:12.080
Ooh.

18:12.147 --> 18:13.715
You have broached

18:13.782 --> 18:15.283
the matter, my son?

18:15.384 --> 18:16.919
What matter?

18:19.589 --> 18:22.292
The matter of Forli.

18:24.361 --> 18:28.966
Our need for
the most sacred alliance.

18:29.034 --> 18:30.367
The matter, in a word,
of marriage.

18:30.468 --> 18:32.436
Ah, I see.

18:32.503 --> 18:34.772
I am to be put back
in the marketplace.

18:34.839 --> 18:37.140
Did you know this,
Brother?

18:37.208 --> 18:39.108
And how secure did
the last alliance

18:39.209 --> 18:41.010
you sold me into
prove to be?

18:41.111 --> 18:42.445
It is your Father's wish.

18:42.513 --> 18:44.381
We would have you married.

18:44.449 --> 18:46.717
It is as simple as that.

18:46.784 --> 18:49.019
I will not marry.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.555
Never again.
So there let it rest.

18:53.024 --> 18:55.625
We are shocked by
this ingratitude.

18:55.693 --> 18:59.028
Even so, I will not marry.

18:59.129 --> 19:01.430
It is a daughter's duty to
marry her father's choice!

19:01.498 --> 19:03.832
So I am to have no
voice in the matter!

19:03.900 --> 19:05.334
I am to lie on my back

19:05.401 --> 19:06.835
and wait to be ravaged by
a beast of your choosing!

19:06.936 --> 19:08.036
Enough! Enough!

19:08.104 --> 19:10.939
This language does
not become you.

19:11.007 --> 19:12.575
And save your thoughts.
Say nothing.

19:12.676 --> 19:14.043
I haven't uttered a word.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.711
No, but we can
hear you thinking.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.349
This will come to pass,
you shall see,

19:19.416 --> 19:22.184
even if we drag you
to the basilica.

19:27.690 --> 19:28.990
Sh, sh, sh.
Giovanni.

19:29.058 --> 19:30.625
Shh.
Hush.

19:30.693 --> 19:34.029
Like me, you have
just declared a war.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.568
<i>What have you</i>
<i>said to Lucrezia?</i>

19:40.669 --> 19:42.003
In the matter of what?

19:42.071 --> 19:43.905
Marriage.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.342
I have said nothing.
Well.

19:47.410 --> 19:50.545
It was you who arranged
the last unfortunate event.

19:50.612 --> 19:52.580
That was not
of my choosing.

19:54.116 --> 19:55.483
You want her to marry?

19:55.551 --> 19:57.385
It is our wish, yes.

19:57.486 --> 19:59.653
Ah, I see,

19:59.721 --> 20:02.056
the Vatican needs
to refresh its coffers.

20:02.124 --> 20:04.325
Well.
Leave us.

20:06.162 --> 20:09.297
Perhaps she is not
ready to marry.

20:09.365 --> 20:12.500
It is not her choice-

20:12.568 --> 20:15.536
and we would have you
persuade her of that.

20:15.604 --> 20:17.871
As inconvenient as
it may seem, Rodrigo,

20:17.939 --> 20:19.806
she fell in love.

20:19.874 --> 20:23.042
And every day the child reminds
her of the man she loved.

20:28.381 --> 20:33.785
Our son Cesare was
sent to the north

20:33.853 --> 20:38.057
on a diplomatic mission
of the utmost importance,

20:38.158 --> 20:41.194
and...

20:41.262 --> 20:43.931
...he had an
unfortunate accident.

20:43.998 --> 20:45.499
Cesare?

20:45.567 --> 20:49.570
No, Giovanni Sforza.

20:49.638 --> 20:54.676
He fell onto a knife
that...

20:54.744 --> 20:57.946
...Cesare happened
to be holding.

20:58.014 --> 21:01.016
Had I been there I would have
helped push him onto the blade.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.385
Yes but, listen
to me, Vanozza,

21:03.453 --> 21:07.823
this accident has
made us enemies.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.625
They are lining up
against us in the north.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.394
We need an alliance.

21:12.462 --> 21:14.829
Now, the Doge of Venice

21:14.897 --> 21:18.766
is a man of great
power and influence.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.268
In a matter of days
his nephew comes here

21:21.369 --> 21:23.437
as a suitor to Lucrezia.

21:23.504 --> 21:25.605
And...

21:25.706 --> 21:30.810
we would have you be
our ambassador in this,

21:30.878 --> 21:34.982
vet him, as it were,
on our daughter's behalf.

21:35.050 --> 21:36.450
I see.
Yeah.

21:40.156 --> 21:42.991
If business is done,
you may withdraw;

21:43.092 --> 21:44.527
the water grows cold.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.934
What is it?

21:51.002 --> 21:54.537
You have a rare beauty,
Vanozza.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.973
Remember when we used
to bath together?

21:57.041 --> 21:59.442
Not after the water went cold.

21:59.543 --> 22:01.110
No.

22:01.178 --> 22:04.714
And have you not foresworn
intimacy for Lent?

22:04.782 --> 22:06.649
Yes.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.451
You may go.

22:09.586 --> 22:12.088
Mmm.

22:22.365 --> 22:24.533
Signore Machiavelli...

22:31.273 --> 22:33.374
Welcome to Rome.

22:33.441 --> 22:37.611
I appreciate the informality
of your welcome.

22:37.679 --> 22:39.547
What is the news
from Florence?

22:39.648 --> 22:41.416
Ah, officially, I am here

22:41.483 --> 22:44.018
to open the shutters of the
Villa Medici for my master,

22:44.119 --> 22:45.653
Piero de Medici.

22:45.721 --> 22:48.389
Stones have been thrown
at his house in Florence.

22:48.490 --> 22:50.357
Large stones.

22:50.425 --> 22:52.993
He believes he will
be safer here in Rome.

22:53.061 --> 22:55.329
Not without our protection.

22:55.397 --> 22:57.298
The Medici have
made many enemies;

22:57.366 --> 22:59.167
that cannot be contested.

22:59.235 --> 23:00.568
What of the Medici bank?

23:00.636 --> 23:02.504
Is it a sinking ship?

23:02.571 --> 23:07.175
Oh, I am not a banker,
but it may have already sunk.

23:07.243 --> 23:08.577
You may not be a banker

23:08.645 --> 23:10.211
but you are the
Medicis' ambassador;

23:10.279 --> 23:11.679
you know these things.

23:11.747 --> 23:15.016
True, I have been privy
to sensitive negotiations.

23:15.117 --> 23:17.484
Signore de Medici
values my opinion-

23:17.552 --> 23:20.754
especially as he does
not have one of his own-

23:20.822 --> 23:23.490
but I am really nothing
more than a nuncio,

23:23.591 --> 23:25.559
a messenger boy.

23:25.626 --> 23:28.128
And what message
does the boy bring?

23:28.229 --> 23:30.564
What of the Vatican funds?

23:30.632 --> 23:32.766
Every penny could be lost.

23:32.834 --> 23:36.470
That is the sour
truth of it.

23:36.538 --> 23:38.139
Where has the money gone?

23:38.240 --> 23:39.841
That is the golden
question.

23:39.942 --> 23:42.477
You are not alone in
wanting an answer.

23:42.578 --> 23:43.879
There are funds,

23:43.946 --> 23:46.581
but the question is,
where might they be?

23:46.649 --> 23:48.417
Do you know?

23:48.485 --> 23:51.053
I am told that what
remains is on the move.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.721
Some here, some there.

23:52.788 --> 23:55.557
Though not on its way
to whom it belongs.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.025
Where?

23:57.126 --> 23:58.960
That I do not know.

23:59.061 --> 24:00.428
Not yet.

24:00.495 --> 24:02.596
Until such time,
it is as I told you:

24:02.697 --> 24:06.232
I am here to open the
shutters at the Villa Medici.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.501
Signore Machiavelli,

24:08.569 --> 24:11.671
a more specific insight
into this matter

24:11.772 --> 24:14.775
would be much appreciated.

24:32.997 --> 24:34.598
Your father claims
that I have warned you

24:34.699 --> 24:37.334
of the dangers of marriage.

24:37.402 --> 24:40.504
You have incurred his
extreme displeasure.

24:43.508 --> 24:45.542
I think it might make him ill.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.445
Well, then, father and
daughter will be ill together.

24:48.513 --> 24:52.615
The thought of marriage
turns my stomach.

24:52.683 --> 24:54.117
It's within his prerogative

24:54.185 --> 24:56.586
to marry you to
whomever he may please.

24:56.654 --> 24:57.954
Well, then, let him do it,

24:58.022 --> 25:00.490
and he can fish me
out of the Tiber.

25:00.558 --> 25:03.059
He's asked me to vet
suitors on your behalf.

25:04.895 --> 25:06.263
And you agreed?

25:06.364 --> 25:09.332
More or less.

25:09.433 --> 25:11.801
Well, at least it leaves
you with a choice.

25:11.869 --> 25:15.739
Mother, the man I married
was a beast.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.908
I was little more
than meat to him.

25:17.975 --> 25:21.178
And yet you took the
stable boy as your lover.

25:21.279 --> 25:24.014
Well, that was different.

25:24.081 --> 25:28.752
And there is hope
for you yet.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.154
I do not deny that
the warm touch of a lover

25:31.222 --> 25:34.357
might ease the pain.

25:34.458 --> 25:36.459
So all is not lost.

25:52.242 --> 25:55.277
Mmm...

25:55.345 --> 25:57.345
You're back.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.418
I dreamed.

26:03.485 --> 26:06.987
What did you dream?

26:07.088 --> 26:10.257
Nothing I have ever seen.

26:10.358 --> 26:14.996
It was not of this world.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.467
Rest now.

26:43.127 --> 26:46.430
What would be your feeling,
Brother Bernadino,

26:46.498 --> 26:49.266
if this humble
sardine was poisoned

26:49.334 --> 26:52.670
and you proceeded to expire?

26:52.738 --> 26:56.941
One of happiness,
Holiness,

26:57.042 --> 27:00.712
for I would have died in
the service of our Lord

27:00.780 --> 27:04.182
and saved His vicar
here on earth.

27:06.987 --> 27:09.855
You are an
inspiration to us all.

27:09.923 --> 27:13.759
God's vicar will strive to
be worthy of your devotion.

27:15.695 --> 27:19.765
Now let us enjoy these
fruits of the sea.

27:29.643 --> 27:34.079
There is a new
order in Florence.

27:34.147 --> 27:36.481
Savonarola wields
yet more power.

27:36.582 --> 27:38.450
All bow to him,

27:38.518 --> 27:40.786
some in fear,
some in reverence.

27:40.854 --> 27:42.354
He virtually
controls the city.

27:42.422 --> 27:43.955
He turned down the hat,
of course.

27:44.023 --> 27:45.557
Hmph.
Scorned it.

27:45.624 --> 27:48.126
Ah.

27:48.227 --> 27:50.829
Yet another insult to Rome.

27:50.896 --> 27:53.598
No one turns down a
seat in the Cardinalate.

27:53.699 --> 27:55.968
Piero de Medici
is hated by all.

27:56.069 --> 27:57.569
Small wonder.

27:57.637 --> 27:59.838
Della Rovere's been
seen in Florence

27:59.906 --> 28:02.674
and is said to have met
with Savonarola.

28:02.742 --> 28:04.510
Ah.

28:05.878 --> 28:08.247
We must silence
this yapping dog.

28:10.483 --> 28:11.683
And Della Rovere,

28:11.751 --> 28:14.085
he should have been
muzzled long ago.

28:14.153 --> 28:15.954
<i>Savonarola claims that</i>
<i>he hears the voice of God</i>

28:16.022 --> 28:18.623
and him alone.

28:18.691 --> 28:22.560
He says that visions are put
<i>into his mind by angels.</i>

28:22.628 --> 28:26.064
Well, that could give us
cause to excommunicate him.

28:27.533 --> 28:28.700
Heresy.

28:28.768 --> 28:30.068
The very worst.

28:30.135 --> 28:33.705
We may yet have
cause to burn him.

28:35.541 --> 28:39.511
We thank you for
responding to our request-

28:39.579 --> 28:42.080
especially in such numbers.

28:42.148 --> 28:44.316
One more would
have made a crowd.

28:44.384 --> 28:45.885
We are here,

28:45.986 --> 28:48.053
but we wonder
to what purpose.

28:48.154 --> 28:50.322
Another lesson in
baking, perhaps.

28:52.125 --> 28:54.026
We were searching
for some time

28:54.093 --> 28:57.997
for a suitable location
to house the poor.

28:58.098 --> 29:01.033
Now we have found it.

29:01.101 --> 29:02.969
Here?

29:03.037 --> 29:05.705
All we need now
<i>are the funds.</i>

29:05.772 --> 29:08.374
Surely it would take
an excessive sum

29:08.442 --> 29:13.079
to make this suitable
for habitation.

29:13.146 --> 29:14.814
That is not a problem.

29:14.915 --> 29:16.616
We manage the works.

29:16.683 --> 29:18.985
The curia will
provide the funds.

29:19.053 --> 29:20.720
What branch of the curia?

29:20.821 --> 29:22.755
The Office of Public Works.

29:22.823 --> 29:25.792
The Office of Public Works
has been emptied of funds

29:25.860 --> 29:28.728
by your charitable endeavours.

29:28.829 --> 29:30.229
I believe it was emptied

29:30.297 --> 29:33.633
long before our efforts begun.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.168
La Bella Farnese
has been combing

29:35.235 --> 29:39.071
through the books of accounts.

29:39.172 --> 29:42.842
Must she now comb
through your palaces?

29:42.910 --> 29:46.012
Through, dare I say it,
the brothels?

29:55.523 --> 29:56.723
He was vice
chancellor himself.

29:56.824 --> 29:58.291
He has palaces of his own.

29:58.392 --> 30:00.093
He knows how things work.

30:00.161 --> 30:04.464
His Holiness is going through
a period of sanctity, penance.

30:04.566 --> 30:06.199
It will pass.

30:06.267 --> 30:07.935
Combing the
books already.

30:08.036 --> 30:09.937
What else might
they do?

30:10.004 --> 30:12.105
Who knows?
They are women.

30:12.173 --> 30:13.840
Women are dangerous.

30:13.908 --> 30:17.177
And how long will this
newfound sanctity last?

30:17.278 --> 30:19.913
Should be over by
Easter, I should hazard.

30:19.981 --> 30:22.649
So, what must we do?

30:22.750 --> 30:25.351
You-restore the ruin.

30:25.419 --> 30:27.387
What?
Ascani, you can't be serious-

30:27.488 --> 30:31.924
Shut up.
And pay for it.

30:31.992 --> 30:34.660
Pay?

30:34.728 --> 30:37.263
He's not serious.
This is unheard of.

30:39.099 --> 30:42.635
Friar Savonarola
berates us daily.

30:42.703 --> 30:45.204
He preaches heresy.

30:45.272 --> 30:47.840
That God speaks to
him and him alone.

30:49.810 --> 30:54.547
He must be silenced.

30:54.614 --> 30:57.583
We charge you with this task.

30:59.419 --> 31:04.357
This will require
all your patience.

31:04.424 --> 31:07.627
You will travel to Florence
and you will ban him

31:07.694 --> 31:09.562
from preaching
the word of God.

31:09.630 --> 31:12.198
He will laugh in my face.
Of course.

31:12.266 --> 31:13.733
Then we will charge him
with heresy.

31:13.801 --> 31:15.468
He will laugh in your face.

31:15.536 --> 31:17.270
Of course.

31:17.338 --> 31:19.406
Then we will
excommunicate him.

31:19.507 --> 31:21.675
He will deny your
right to do so.

31:21.776 --> 31:24.211
Of course.

31:24.279 --> 31:26.313
And then...

31:26.414 --> 31:29.850
...we will burn him.

31:33.521 --> 31:38.057
Vengeance, you see,
can wait.

31:38.159 --> 31:40.594
A lifetime if necessary.

31:46.868 --> 31:49.404
Wagons carrying Medici gold

31:49.471 --> 31:53.207
are to be shipped
to Castelfiorentino.

31:53.275 --> 31:55.709
There is a stronghold
there.

31:55.777 --> 31:59.046
So the Medici coffers
are not entirely empty.

31:59.114 --> 32:02.650
Not if one knows
where to look.

32:02.718 --> 32:04.619
How much gold?

32:04.687 --> 32:06.521
Not enough for
a king's ransom,

32:06.589 --> 32:09.858
but one hopes sufficient to
make your detour worthwhile.

32:09.959 --> 32:11.426
Enough to feed an army?

32:11.494 --> 32:14.062
Armies have big bellies.

32:14.163 --> 32:16.698
Let this map be your guide;

32:16.765 --> 32:18.333
I prepared it myself.

32:18.400 --> 32:22.703
Here is the route, the day,
all you need to know.

32:22.771 --> 32:27.207
Look for wagons under escort
transporting alum ore.

32:27.274 --> 32:29.342
Trade in alum
is on the increase.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.478
Do not be deceived
by appearances.

32:32.546 --> 32:36.983
The gold is hidden
on the wagons.

32:37.050 --> 32:38.484
I must go.

32:38.552 --> 32:40.686
To open more shutters?

32:40.754 --> 32:45.024
To let in more light.
Yes.

32:45.092 --> 32:50.396
The light you bring to us
is much appreciated.

32:50.464 --> 32:52.631
Just a beginning.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.143
I would make a gift
of gold to my father.

33:07.679 --> 33:10.181
Does your father not have
gold enough of his own?

33:10.282 --> 33:12.884
No, this is Medici gold.

33:12.952 --> 33:15.186
My father holds
no affection for the Medici.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.855
He brands them
thieves and liars.

33:16.923 --> 33:18.990
All bankers are thieves
and liars, Eminence.

33:19.058 --> 33:22.328
I would rather trust
a beggar in the street.

33:22.395 --> 33:24.363
Listen.

33:24.431 --> 33:27.333
A shipment of gold
hidden in alum ore

33:27.401 --> 33:31.371
is to travel from Florence
to Castelfiorentino.

33:31.472 --> 33:33.306
It shall be ours.

33:33.374 --> 33:38.277
For this, we will
need our friends.

33:38.378 --> 33:42.013
If there is gold promised,
they will be there.

33:42.115 --> 33:43.348
Not only will we bring

33:43.416 --> 33:46.451
the Friar Savonarola
to his unholy knees,

33:46.518 --> 33:50.454
we will also bring
Medici gold to my father.

33:50.522 --> 33:52.256
Your father knows of this?

33:52.323 --> 33:54.291
He will know when
he sees the gold.

33:54.392 --> 33:56.027
Surely such
a gift from a son

33:56.094 --> 33:59.197
deserves reward
from the father, no?

33:59.298 --> 34:00.832
I will have only one reward-

34:00.900 --> 34:03.268
and I will have it
no matter what.

34:03.336 --> 34:06.004
These robes have clung to
my back for far too long.

34:06.105 --> 34:10.141
Yes, I bear witness
to that, Eminence.

34:10.208 --> 34:13.110
For the protection of
Rome and the Holy Church-

34:13.179 --> 34:16.514
and the protection
of my unwitting father,

34:16.581 --> 34:20.184
I will command
the papal army.

34:20.284 --> 34:21.851
And you, Micheletto,

34:21.920 --> 34:24.987
you will wear armour
and be my captain.

34:25.056 --> 34:27.725
No, I was born in the shadows

34:27.792 --> 34:30.092
and I feel that is
where I should remain.

34:33.264 --> 34:35.465
First, the prize.

34:51.114 --> 34:52.949
The Doge of Venice?

34:53.050 --> 34:54.952
His nephew.

34:55.018 --> 34:56.553
Oh.

34:56.654 --> 34:58.588
Is he of consequence?

34:58.656 --> 35:01.390
His uncle, the doge,
has immense wealth

35:01.458 --> 35:04.360
and is extremely
fond of his nephew.

35:04.428 --> 35:06.129
At least take a look at him

35:06.196 --> 35:09.632
then I can tell your father
I have done his bidding.

35:09.699 --> 35:12.635
The Doge of Venice is a man
fond of war, is he not?

35:12.702 --> 35:15.004
They are all fond
of war in the north.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.006
But I cannot speak
for the nephew.

35:17.073 --> 35:20.676
Just cast an eye
over him, that's all.

35:23.513 --> 35:25.781
Where is he,
this doge's nephew?

35:25.849 --> 35:28.951
Waiting in the main
hall with his retinue.

35:29.019 --> 35:31.821
Most likely dying
of old age by this time.

35:35.793 --> 35:37.060
Very well.

35:37.128 --> 35:38.762
You go and talk to him
and I will watch.

35:44.301 --> 35:46.970
This is not a game, you know.

35:47.071 --> 35:49.239
No, but it feels like one.

35:52.376 --> 35:54.577
Oh, and he has a dog.
A gift.

35:54.645 --> 35:56.780
A dog?
For you.

35:56.847 --> 35:58.782
A man of immense
wealth, you say,

35:58.883 --> 36:00.783
and he brings a dog?

36:05.022 --> 36:06.923
I don't think I've ever
seen a dog quite like this.

36:06.991 --> 36:08.891
<i>It's a wolfhound, my lady.</i>

36:08.959 --> 36:10.393
<i>It's one of the</i>
<i>tallest breeds.</i>

36:10.460 --> 36:12.094
<i>A hunting dog.</i>

36:12.162 --> 36:13.696
<i>He's a powerful beast</i>

36:13.764 --> 36:15.765
<i>but he will make a loving</i>
<i>and loyal companion.</i>

36:15.832 --> 36:18.501
Hmm.

36:18.569 --> 36:21.037
What do you think?

36:21.105 --> 36:22.973
Impressive, no?

36:23.074 --> 36:25.609
The man or the girl?

36:28.647 --> 36:31.481
What is your verdict?

36:31.549 --> 36:33.483
No.

36:33.551 --> 36:36.987
That's no to
the doge's nephew.

36:37.088 --> 36:39.522
And yes to the dog.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.263
Wait, on second thoughts,
it's no to them both.

36:48.365 --> 36:49.765
Man and dog.

37:00.811 --> 37:02.879
It was kind of you to
come but I'm afraid...

37:04.582 --> 37:08.752
I have another
venture for you.

37:08.820 --> 37:14.891
First, you will escort me to
Florence on Vatican business.

37:14.959 --> 37:19.629
And then there will be
rewards for all of us.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.598
You said that the last time.

37:21.666 --> 37:25.034
Well, this time there is gold.

37:25.135 --> 37:27.903
Medici gold.

37:27.971 --> 37:29.905
They are robbing
their own bank,

37:29.973 --> 37:32.074
so we will rob them.

37:32.175 --> 37:35.978
Trust me.
My name is Borgia.

37:38.082 --> 37:40.551
Let's hope the cardinals
<i>have consciences.</i>

37:40.618 --> 37:42.720
What more can we do?

37:48.126 --> 37:50.628
This was left this morning,

37:50.696 --> 37:53.698
like a baby abandoned
on a doorstep.

37:56.502 --> 37:58.837
A victory.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.805
It's a start.

38:00.873 --> 38:02.641
Let the works begin.

38:08.081 --> 38:11.183
So...
Piero de Medici,

38:11.284 --> 38:13.285
to what does Rome
owe the pleasure

38:13.386 --> 38:17.089
of your forsaking
of your beloved Florence?

38:17.157 --> 38:20.059
Holiness, a torch
was put to our house.

38:20.127 --> 38:22.028
We left the city
in a hail of stones.

38:22.096 --> 38:26.099
Dramatic exit indeed.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.101
You have come
bearing the gold

38:28.168 --> 38:30.803
we deposited with
the Medici bank?

38:30.871 --> 38:34.407
Or have those funds gone up
in flames with your palaces?

38:34.475 --> 38:37.009
Those funds are in safe
hands, Holy Father.

38:37.077 --> 38:38.410
Oh.

38:38.478 --> 38:40.112
But they are on the move,
to secure locations.

38:40.213 --> 38:45.751
We thank you for
your assurance.

38:45.819 --> 38:48.788
So why exactly are you here?

38:48.856 --> 38:51.457
I would plead for the Holy
Father's protection in Rome.

38:51.525 --> 38:53.092
And for his help

38:53.160 --> 38:55.094
in the battle against
the Friar Savonarola.

38:55.161 --> 38:57.129
We have dispatched our son,
Cardinal Borgia,

38:57.197 --> 39:00.132
to secure his silence.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.367
You think he can
be silenced?

39:02.435 --> 39:04.602
If not, he will be burned.

39:04.670 --> 39:07.739
And there will be
flourishing once again

39:07.807 --> 39:09.841
in your fair Florence a bank-

39:09.908 --> 39:13.378
but this time a Vatican bank.

39:13.446 --> 39:17.049
What does the pope
know of banking?

39:17.150 --> 39:19.318
What the pope does not know,

39:19.385 --> 39:24.758
Piero de Medici
will teach him.

39:27.795 --> 39:30.030
Holiness.
Father...

39:33.434 --> 39:35.668
Since Jesus died for us,

39:35.769 --> 39:39.038
since he gave his life for us-

39:39.106 --> 39:42.575
-his blood for us,
his pain for us,

39:42.643 --> 39:45.144
let us kneel for him!

39:48.315 --> 39:50.116
Girolamo Savonarola!

39:53.620 --> 39:57.491
I am Cardinal Cesare Borgia!

39:57.558 --> 39:59.192
The bastard son
of the pope!

39:59.260 --> 40:03.130
I am the servant of our most
Holy Father, Vicar of Christ,

40:03.198 --> 40:06.134
and voice of the Living God,
Pope Alexander Sextus.

40:07.669 --> 40:09.571
This edict finds
you guilty

40:09.638 --> 40:11.406
of disseminating
pernicious doctrines

40:11.473 --> 40:14.576
to the scandal and
grief of simple souls.

40:14.644 --> 40:17.346
Having incurred our
Holy Father's censure,

40:17.414 --> 40:19.581
you are hereby ordered

40:19.649 --> 40:21.784
to suspend your
sermons and prophecies,

40:21.852 --> 40:23.518
lest you be charged
with heresy.

40:23.586 --> 40:26.221
I thank His Holiness.

40:26.289 --> 40:30.258
And tell him I will use it...

40:30.360 --> 40:32.227
...to wipe my ass!

40:40.671 --> 40:44.340
You are standing too close to
the fire, Brother Savonarola.

40:44.408 --> 40:46.142
You may get burned.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.080
Think you I fear the flame?

40:50.181 --> 40:52.349
I have the word of God.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.786
It is the Borgias
who will burn!

41:14.640 --> 41:19.010
This time, a little more.

41:22.414 --> 41:24.515
Heaven and Hell?

41:24.583 --> 41:26.918
Heaven and Hell.

41:41.534 --> 41:42.968
Do you have faith?

41:43.069 --> 41:44.970
Yes, Father.

41:45.038 --> 41:47.206
Then drink.

42:25.380 --> 42:27.782
<i>Stop the sinners!</i>

42:27.850 --> 42:29.484
<i>You deserve to suffer!</i>

42:31.387 --> 42:33.755
Move.

42:40.695 --> 42:43.096
My God.
What is this?

42:43.164 --> 42:45.031
Sodomites.
The lot of them.

42:45.132 --> 42:46.466
They're to be hanged,

42:46.533 --> 42:48.935
then burned by order
of Father Savonarola.

42:49.036 --> 42:52.405
Sodomites!

42:52.506 --> 42:54.473
<i>Burn in hell!</i>

42:54.541 --> 42:57.043
Sodomite scum!
Die!

42:57.145 --> 42:58.912
In the name
of Jesus Christ.

42:58.980 --> 43:00.948
What, in the name
of Jesus Christ?

43:01.016 --> 43:02.583
The ring off your finger.

43:04.186 --> 43:06.621
And you, boy,
what would you have?

43:06.655 --> 43:09.291
My boot up your ass?

43:09.325 --> 43:10.826
Sodomite!

43:10.860 --> 43:12.994
Here is one-
a sodomite!

43:13.029 --> 43:17.298
Sodomite!
Sodomite!

43:17.333 --> 43:19.501
Move!
Out of the way!

43:21.704 --> 43:23.271
Move!

43:23.339 --> 43:24.739
Back!
Move back!

43:24.807 --> 43:27.909
<i>You can run from God</i>
<i>but you cannot hide!</i>

43:27.977 --> 43:29.577
Sodomites!
Move away! All of you!

43:29.645 --> 43:31.679
<i>He will get you!</i>

43:35.851 --> 43:37.519
You promised them booty,
your Eminence.

43:37.587 --> 43:39.220
There is booty to be found,

43:39.322 --> 43:42.157
but not in Florence.

43:42.258 --> 43:44.125
Come on!
Yah! Yah!

44:03.012 --> 44:05.046
What was that?

44:05.114 --> 44:06.581
Ah!

44:06.649 --> 44:07.783
Uh!

44:09.318 --> 44:11.253
Easy meat.

44:13.523 --> 44:15.157
Too easy.

44:18.628 --> 44:20.262
So, condottieri!

44:21.398 --> 44:22.698
Ah!

44:24.702 --> 44:25.702
Booty at last.

44:25.769 --> 44:27.404
Wait!

44:27.472 --> 44:28.605
Ah!

44:31.776 --> 44:32.910
Ugh!

44:50.093 --> 44:51.727
Find it!

44:51.828 --> 44:53.628
Ah, you dog!

44:55.131 --> 44:56.698
Ugh!

44:56.766 --> 44:58.433
Ah!

45:01.971 --> 45:03.505
Ah!

45:18.756 --> 45:20.090
My lord.

45:20.157 --> 45:24.695
Colonna, can you
make gold from alum?

45:24.763 --> 45:27.465
We are condottieri,
not alchemists.

45:27.532 --> 45:29.868
Aha.

45:29.935 --> 45:32.437
We shall have to pay
you in gold then.

45:38.443 --> 45:40.177
How long might
this game go on?

45:40.245 --> 45:41.912
Until we run out
of princes.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.881
We've already seen five.
This will be number six.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.851
At first it was a distraction;
now it's a chore.

45:46.918 --> 45:49.186
Then marry one of them
and be done with it.

45:49.254 --> 45:50.955
Have a bed chamber
of your own

45:51.022 --> 45:53.024
and put a strong
lock on the door.

46:03.169 --> 46:05.571
Which one is the suitor?

46:05.639 --> 46:09.008
The one in the blue velvet,
at the front.

46:09.076 --> 46:12.044
Calvino Pallavicini
from Genova.

46:14.881 --> 46:16.749
And, behind him,
in the brown and grey.

46:16.850 --> 46:19.218
Who is he?

46:19.286 --> 46:22.855
<i>That must be Raffaello</i>
<i>di Genova, his brother.</i>

46:28.261 --> 46:30.762
Who did you say?

46:30.830 --> 46:32.064
His name
is Raffaello.

46:32.131 --> 46:34.500
He is the younger brother
of Calvino.

46:34.568 --> 46:37.503
I just told you,
he is not your suitor.

46:37.571 --> 46:41.040
The other one, Calvino-
that is your suitor.

46:48.583 --> 46:50.752
Savonarola remains defiant.

46:50.820 --> 46:52.287
Oh.

46:52.355 --> 46:54.489
And you are learning patience?

46:54.557 --> 46:56.191
With difficulty,
Holy Father.

46:58.027 --> 47:00.228
I have a gift for you.

47:10.673 --> 47:12.407
Medici gold.

47:14.410 --> 47:16.311
Enough for the Forli campaign.

47:18.315 --> 47:20.316
They are dispersing
the bank's funds

47:20.383 --> 47:21.950
through the
whole of Italy.

47:22.018 --> 47:23.685
If we could track
down the rest,

47:23.753 --> 47:28.057
we could even
conquer Florence.

47:28.125 --> 47:31.394
And you would equip
an army with it.

47:31.462 --> 47:34.230
I would batter the
walls of Forli with it

47:34.298 --> 47:37.067
and drag Catherina Sforza
in chains before you.

47:37.168 --> 47:40.704
You would be a soldier?

47:40.772 --> 47:45.843
You know that has always
been my heart's desire.

47:45.911 --> 47:50.014
But who would advise me
in this Vatican?

47:50.082 --> 47:53.384
Who would guide me,
protect us?

47:53.451 --> 47:55.786
Hm?

47:55.854 --> 47:58.021
We always said we must
have one son in the cloth,

47:58.089 --> 47:59.356
and one in armour.

47:59.424 --> 48:02.392
Would you have us
make Juan a cardinal?

48:02.460 --> 48:05.094
No.

48:05.162 --> 48:08.464
We thank you from
the bottom of our heart.

48:08.532 --> 48:11.934
But you know what you
ask is impossible.

48:12.035 --> 48:14.203
Your brother's coming home,

48:14.271 --> 48:17.506
a changed man, we are assured.

48:17.574 --> 48:22.711
With a party of conquistadors
hardened by the New Spain.

48:22.779 --> 48:28.951
Promise us that you
will welcome him-

48:29.052 --> 48:31.921
with a brotherly embrace.

48:33.023 --> 48:36.760
You must embrace him
for me, Holy Father.

48:36.827 --> 48:39.496
While I attend to the
Church's business-

48:39.563 --> 48:41.765
back in Florence.

48:41.790 --> 48:45.790
