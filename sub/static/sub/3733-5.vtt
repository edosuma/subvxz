WEBVTT

00:02.730 --> 00:05.699
- Previously on Hannibal...
- If this is about my position
at the palazzo,

00:05.730 --> 00:09.405
once the path was cleared, I won
the job fairly on my merits.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.103
- Two men from the Capponi
are dead. You are going
to be caught.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.301
- Europe is where a man
of his tastes would settle.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.741
- His tastes are very specific.
- That's how you'll find him.

00:18.780 --> 00:22.489
- Come back with me. We have a
chance to regain our reputations

00:22.520 --> 00:24.579
by capturing the Mostro.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.157
- I'm here for Will Graham.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.784
- I have no reason to stay here.
He saw to that.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.752
I'll help you find him.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.621
On still evenings,

00:37.670 --> 00:40.264
when the air was damp
after a rain,

00:40.300 --> 00:42.609
we played a game.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.576
Hannibal would burn all kinds
of barks and incense

00:46.610 --> 00:49.477
for me to identify
by scent alone.

01:00.290 --> 01:03.123
He was charming...

01:03.160 --> 01:05.628
the way a cub

01:05.660 --> 01:07.457
is charming.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.397
A small cub that grows up

01:13.440 --> 01:16.466
to be like one of the big cats.

01:16.510 --> 01:21.129
- One you can't play with later.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.682
- The day I met Hannibal,

01:32.720 --> 01:34.813
he was an orphan.

01:34.860 --> 01:37.829
I was meant
to meet hIm

01:37.860 --> 01:40.226
with his sister,

01:40.260 --> 01:42.524
but he was alone.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.368
- How did you meet him?

01:48.400 --> 01:52.632
- I was his aunt's attendant.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.138
My parents sent me to learn
from Lady Murasaki

01:56.180 --> 01:59.149
when I was just a girl.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.514
I learned from Hannibal, too.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.781
- He comes in the guise
of a mentor,

02:10.830 --> 02:13.822
but it's distress
that excites him.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.863
- I'm not in distress.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.267
- Not anymore.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.808
You had a strict rule

02:24.840 --> 02:27.502
about taking life

02:27.540 --> 02:30.703
and you broke it.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.617
Is it on your mind?

02:33.650 --> 02:36.244
Do you see yourself killing him

02:36.290 --> 02:38.440
over and over?

02:40.960 --> 02:44.748
- No.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.327
I see you.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.333
How do you know Hannibal's
in Florence?

02:58.740 --> 03:00.731
- Botticelli.

03:09.950 --> 03:12.748
- I've never been to Italy.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.281
I've never expected to.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.788
Birds eat thousands
of snails every day.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.607
Some of those s_nails
survwe digestion

03:32.640 --> 03:35.438
and emerge to find

03:35.480 --> 03:38.301
they've traveled the world.

03:40.580 --> 03:43.344
- In the belly of the beast.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.387
- I kept cochlear gardens as a
young man to attract fireflies.

04:22.430 --> 04:26.059
Their larvae would devour

04:26.090 --> 04:28.729
many times their own
body weight in snails.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.661
Fuel...

04:31.700 --> 04:34.692
to power a transformation
into a delicate creature

04:34.740 --> 04:37.004
of such beauty.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.055
- To the misfortune
of the snail.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.081
- Snails follow
their nature

04:59.130 --> 05:01.655
as surely as those
that eat them.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.999
- Fireflies live
very brief lives.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.858
- Better to live true to
yourself for an instant
than never know it.

05:10.910 --> 05:14.732
- Not like Will Graham does.

05:14.780 --> 05:18.602
- An insect lacks morality
to agonize over.

05:18.650 --> 05:22.017
Will agonizes about
inevitable change.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.939
- Almost anything can be trained

05:24.990 --> 05:29.450
to resist its instinct.

05:29.490 --> 05:32.596
A shepherd dog doesn't
savage the sheep.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.467
- But it wants to.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.708
Will has reached a state
of moral dumbfounding.

05:44.740 --> 05:48.733
Empathy and
reciprocity.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.101
- Reciprocity.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.539
If we keep track of incoming

05:53.580 --> 05:56.413
and outgoing intentions,

05:56.450 --> 05:59.453
Will Graham is en route
to kill you

05:59.490 --> 06:01.685
while you lie in wait
to kill him.

06:03.890 --> 06:06.723
Now that's reciprocity.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.375
***

07:25.740 --> 07:28.106
- Ciao, Bella.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.033
(people laughing)

08:36.080 --> 08:38.742
- Grazie.
- Here we are.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.748
- Mmm! Grazie.
- Prego.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.714
- You've recently stopped
wearing your wedding ring.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.913
- Yes, and you've recently
started wearing yours.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.612
(laughing)
- I have a young
and lovely wife.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.720
Her efforts have ground
twelve pounds

08:51.760 --> 08:53.990
off my frame.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.692
- La Vita Nuova.
- Yeah.

08:56.730 --> 08:58.698
- Divorced?

08:58.730 --> 09:00.960
- No. Widowed.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.867
I met her here.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.629
It's a little strange to be
in Italy without her.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.604
- What was her name?
- Bella.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.800
- To Bella.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.841
- To Bella.
- To Bella.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.949
- I look at her and I think
about all the things

09:22.990 --> 09:25.857
I want to give her...

09:25.890 --> 09:28.757
- How you will be seen
in her eyes.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.019
- Certainly not in my present
role at the Questura.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.095
I perform menial errands
found for me

09:34.140 --> 09:36.358
by my former
subordinates.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.834
Interviews

09:38.870 --> 09:41.179
in missing person cases.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.747
They've enjoyed
my fall from grace.

09:43.780 --> 09:46.078
- You weren't in Palermo

09:46.110 --> 09:47.975
on official business.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.080
- Neither were you.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.259
- And your subordinates
at the Questura,

09:56.290 --> 09:59.748
they know you're investigating
Hannibal Lecter?
- I'll tell them,

09:59.800 --> 10:02.223
when I know it's Lecter
that I'm investigating.

10:02.260 --> 10:05.923
- You already know.

10:05.970 --> 10:07.835
- I need to be certain.

10:07.870 --> 10:10.737
I am disgraced

10:10.770 --> 10:13.637
and out of fortune.
- It has inclined you

10:13.680 --> 10:17.002
towards a game that's
outside of the law.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.802
I know. I played that game.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.818
And I lost.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.717
- Let's eat.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.981
- Oh, my goodness...
how beautiful.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.750
- Pasta?
- Please.

10:29.790 --> 10:33.021
- This is pappardelle alla
lepre. Can you say it?

10:33.060 --> 10:36.223
- Par-par-delle alla...
- No, no. It's not
"par-par-delle".

10:36.260 --> 10:38.262
- No--no--
- No, it's "pappardelle."

10:38.300 --> 10:40.268
- Pappardelle.
- Yeah! That's it. Yes.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.905
With lepre.
- Ah, well, thank you.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.211
- A table setting from the home
of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.417
The silverware is
19th-century Dutch

10:59.450 --> 11:02.385
from Christofle.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.651
The plate is Gien French
china from Tiffany.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.961
The table linen
is damask cotton,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.298
also from Christofle.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.468
- You've got to hand it
to the man.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.937
He has the most marvelous taste.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.471
- I've discovered
a pattern of purchases.

11:23.510 --> 11:26.946
An echo of the life
he lived in Baltimore.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.778
- He likes music, he likes wine,

11:29.820 --> 11:32.914
he likes food and he likes you.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.281
How did you taste, Dr. Bloom?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.925
Sweet, I bet.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.794
I'm sure you got
a taste of him, too.

11:41.830 --> 11:45.163
Spitters are quitters, and you
don't strike me as a quitter.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.909
- The first step in the
development of taste

11:54.940 --> 11:57.841
is to be willing to credit
your own opinion.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.115
But in the areas
of food and wine,

12:06.150 --> 12:08.812
I have to follow

12:08.860 --> 12:12.182
Hannibal's precedents.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.993
A receipt from a Florentine
fine grocer,

12:19.030 --> 12:21.396
Vera dal 1926,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.864
for two bottles
of Btard-Montrachet

12:24.910 --> 12:29.131
and some tartufi bianchi.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.516
And another. And another.
And another.

12:37.550 --> 12:41.054
- Huh!
- Once a week,

12:41.090 --> 12:43.058
for the last three months,

12:43.090 --> 12:46.457
a blonde woman has been making
the exact same purchase.

12:46.490 --> 12:49.220
- Due bottiglie
di Btard-Montrachet

12:49.260 --> 12:51.399
e li tartufi bianchi,
per favore.

12:51.430 --> 12:54.365
- And she always pays cash.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.531
- Grazie.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.504
- She's shopping for Hannibal.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.774
- Bravo.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.458
- Are we obligated to talk?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.094
- No.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.064
- Strange to talk so much.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.204
Not used to hearing voices

14:06.240 --> 14:09.437
outside my head.

14:09.480 --> 14:14.417
- I hear_voic_es
from all directions.

14:14.450 --> 14:18.546
In the gnawing sameness
of your days...

14:21.220 --> 14:22.983
...did you look at
the shape of things?

14:25.430 --> 14:27.398
At...

14:27.430 --> 14:30.160
what you were becoming?

14:30.200 --> 14:33.897
- I wasn't becoming anything.

14:35.700 --> 14:39.568
I was standing still.

14:42.380 --> 14:46.168
Exactly where he left me
standing.

14:46.210 --> 14:49.441
Like taxidermy.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.608
- Hollowed out and...

14:52.650 --> 14:54.686
filled with something else.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.951
- Not something else.

14:57.990 --> 15:01.255
I'm not as malleable as you are.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.167
I was violent

15:04.200 --> 15:07.397
when it was
the right thing to do.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.262
But I think you like it.

15:15.110 --> 15:18.147
- We afforded each other
an experience

15:18.180 --> 15:20.614
we may not otherwise have had.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.241
- If you don't kill him,

15:26.290 --> 15:29.953
you're afraid you are going
to become him.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.992
- Yes.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.260
- There are means
of influence

15:37.300 --> 15:39.689
other than violence.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.535
- Dr. Fell?
- Yes.

16:15.570 --> 16:18.403
- I am Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi

16:18.440 --> 16:20.476
from the Questura
di Firenze.

16:20.510 --> 16:23.001
I was wondering

16:23.050 --> 16:25.177
if you ever met
your predecessor?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.713
- Never met him.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.218
Read several of his monographs.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.421
_ -_ The officers who first
investigated checked the Palazzo

16:41.460 --> 16:44.122
for any sort
of note

16:44.170 --> 16:47.469
-farewell notes, suicide notes-

16:47.500 --> 16:49.798
found nothing.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.037
- The going assumption is,
he eloped with a woman

16:53.080 --> 16:55.230
and her money.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.147
(laughing)
- What is the going assumption

16:58.180 --> 17:00.569
regarding
Professor Sogliato?

17:00.620 --> 17:04.408
- Still no word?

17:04.450 --> 17:07.453
- You may have had the last
word with Sogliato.

17:07.490 --> 17:11.187
Your colleague...

17:11.230 --> 17:13.198
Signor Albizzi, tells me

17:13.230 --> 17:15.425
no one has spoken
to Professor Sogliato

17:15.460 --> 17:18.668
since he declined your
invitation to dinner.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.636
He is the second to have
disappeared from the Palazzo.

17:22.670 --> 17:25.434
- Like any good investigator,

17:25.470 --> 17:27.574
I'm sure you're sifting the
circumstances for profit.

17:27.610 --> 17:31.478
- Both were bachelors,

17:31.510 --> 17:34.149
well-respected scholars

17:34.180 --> 17:36.717
with orderly lives.

17:36.750 --> 17:40.151
They had some savings,
nothing much.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.228
- Commendatore Pazzi?
- Yeah?

17:48.260 --> 17:52.390
- I think you are a Pazzi
of the Pazzi, am I correct?

17:52.430 --> 17:56.196
- How did you know that?

17:56.240 --> 17:59.459
- You resemble a figure
at the Della Robbia roundels

17:59.510 --> 18:01.603
in your family's chapel
at Santa Croce.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.541
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.447
That was Andrea de Pazzi

18:07.480 --> 18:10.187
depicted as John the Baptist.

18:10.220 --> 18:14.179
- Then there's the most famous
Pazzi of all: Francesco.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.781
He attempted to assassinate
Lorenzo the Magnificent

18:17.830 --> 18:21.493
in the cathedral,
at Mass, in 1478.

18:21.530 --> 18:25.193
- Yes, the Pazzi family

18:25.230 --> 18:28.461
were all brought low
on that Sunday.

18:32.670 --> 18:36.504
If you come upon
anything, Dr. Fell,

18:36.540 --> 18:39.338
anything personal
from the missing men,

18:39.380 --> 18:41.348
will you call me?

18:41.380 --> 18:44.440
- Of course, Commendatore.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.678
- [State your business, please.]

19:47.720 --> 19:50.484
- I may have information

19:50.520 --> 19:52.488
about Hannibal Lecter.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.488
- [Do you know where he is now?]

19:54.520 --> 19:56.750
- I believe so.

19:56.790 --> 19:59.224
Is the reward in effect?

19:59.260 --> 20:01.251
- [Why haven't you
called the police?]

20:01.300 --> 20:03.791
[I'm required to
encourage you to do so.]

20:03.830 --> 20:06.526
- Is the reward payable in...

20:06.570 --> 20:09.539
special circumstances?

20:09.570 --> 20:13.802
To someone not ordinarily
eligible?

20:13.840 --> 20:16.570
- [Do you mean a bounty
on Dr. Lecter?]

20:16.610 --> 20:18.771
- Yes.

20:18.810 --> 20:21.347
- [It is against international
convention to offer a bounty]

20:21.380 --> 20:23.610
[for someone's death, sir.
Are you calling from Europe?]

20:23.650 --> 20:26.346
- Yes, I am.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.551
That's all I'm telling you.

20:28.590 --> 20:31.252
- [I suggest you contact
an attorney to discuss]

20:31.290 --> 20:33.656
[the legality of bounties.
May I recommend one?]

20:33.700 --> 20:36.851
[There is one in Geneva,
I encourage you strongly
to call him]

20:36.900 --> 20:38.868
[and be frank about the matter.]

20:38.900 --> 20:41.869
[Would you like
the number, sir?]

20:41.900 --> 20:43.868
[Sir?]

20:43.910 --> 20:46.606
- Yes. Give me the number.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.995
***

21:59.380 --> 22:02.019
- I prefer the sound and feel
of the harpsichord.

22:02.050 --> 22:04.712
More alive,

22:04.750 --> 22:07.651
the music arrives
like experience,

22:07.690 --> 22:11.581
sudden and entire.

22:11.630 --> 22:15.726
The piano has
the quality of a memory.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.637
Today has the quality
of a memory.

22:23.670 --> 22:26.867
- You've met Inspector
Pazzi before.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.629
- In my youth...

22:31.750 --> 22:34.514
We shared a fondness
for Botticelli

22:34.550 --> 22:37.383
and crossed paths
in the Uffizi Gallery,

22:37.420 --> 22:40.651
beneath La Primavera.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.420
- Does he know...

22:43.460 --> 22:45.451
what you are?

22:48.660 --> 22:52.494
- When I looked into his face
and stood close enough
to smell him,

22:52.530 --> 22:55.636
I was well aware that all
the elements of epiphany
were present.

22:55.670 --> 22:59.561
- And yet
here you are,

22:59.610 --> 23:03.501
free to tell me
all about it.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.768
- He must wait,

23:05.810 --> 23:07.914
and lurk and think.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.680
It's too soon
to flush his quarry.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.609
He's deciding what to do.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.653
- Someone's put a price
on your head.

23:21.460 --> 23:24.588
- As an early-warning system,
a bounty is better than radar.

23:24.630 --> 23:27.838
It inclines authorities
everywhere

23:27.870 --> 23:29.792
to forsake their duty
and scramble after me

23:29.840 --> 23:32.638
privately.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.774
- Should Rinaldo Pazzi
join Professor Sogliato

23:39.810 --> 23:43.712
and the late curator of the
Palazzo down in the damp?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.081
Should his body be found

23:48.120 --> 23:51.089
after an apparent suicide?

23:51.130 --> 23:54.099
- No. Rinaldo Pazzi,

23:54.130 --> 23:56.758
a Pazzi of the Pazzi,

23:56.800 --> 23:59.963
chief inspector at
the Florentine Questura,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.468
has to decide what
his honor is worth.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.833
- What is it worth

24:05.870 --> 24:07.838
to be known as the man

24:07.880 --> 24:11.475
who caught Hannibal Lecter?

24:11.510 --> 24:14.638
- For a policeman, credit
has a short half-life.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.887
Better to sell me.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.959
(He resumes playing.)

24:27.160 --> 24:30.459
(dripping sound)

24:45.150 --> 24:48.540
(dripping sound)

25:27.090 --> 25:29.854
- I like the night.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.859
It's more than a period of time;

25:32.890 --> 25:37.020
it's another place.

25:37.060 --> 25:41.099
It's different from where
we are during the day.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.768
- We're different from
who we are during the day.

25:45.970 --> 25:50.179
Little more hidden,
little less seen.

25:50.210 --> 25:52.599
- When life is most
like a dream.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.810
- Why are you searching for him?

26:06.190 --> 26:09.353
What are you hoping to find?

26:09.400 --> 26:12.858
- I'm not searching
for Hannibal.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.665
I know exactly where he is.

26:19.710 --> 26:23.009
- Is he in Florence?

26:26.350 --> 26:28.614
- Yes.

26:31.150 --> 26:35.211
- Why didn't you
tell me you knew?

26:35.260 --> 26:38.957
- I told you...

26:38.990 --> 26:44.064
there_ are means
of influence

26:44.100 --> 26:47.319
other than violence.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.646
But violence

27:06.690 --> 27:21.094
is what you understand.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.632
(train horn)

28:54.200 --> 28:56.851
- [Hello, Rinaldo!]

28:56.900 --> 29:00.893
- Hello.
- [Thank you so much
for reaching out.]

29:00.940 --> 29:03.807
[Without the cooperation
of concerned citizens]

29:03.840 --> 29:06.001
[such as yourself,]

29:06.040 --> 29:09.828
monsters like Hannibal Lecter
would be running Wild.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.848
- [Shall we?]

29:11.880 --> 29:15.543
- Let's.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.947
I will privately pay
three million dollars

29:18.990 --> 29:22.187
[for the doctor alive,
no questions asked,]

29:22.220 --> 29:24.859
[discretion guaranteed.]

29:24.890 --> 29:26.858
[Those terms include]

29:26.890 --> 29:29.927
a one-hundred-thousand
dollar advance.

29:29.960 --> 29:33.225
To qualify for the advance,
you must provide

29:33.270 --> 29:36.262
[a positively identifiable
fingerprint]

29:36.300 --> 29:39.201
[from Dr. Lecter.]

29:39.240 --> 29:41.834
[Capito?]

29:41.880 --> 29:46.374
- Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.311
- I will require
a fresh fingerprint

29:49.350 --> 29:51.887
in situ and unlifted,

29:51.920 --> 29:54.889
on an object for my experts

29:54.920 --> 29:57.923
to examine independently.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.178
You don't want
to alarm the doctor.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.858
He may disappear
too well and...

30:02.900 --> 30:05.095
- [I would be left
with nothing.]

30:05.130 --> 30:08.531
- Si.
- So you have no illusions

30:08.570 --> 30:11.562
about what's going
to happen to Dr. Lecter.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.306
You would be selling him
into torture and death.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.831
- [I'm aware.]

30:16.880 --> 30:19.007
- You get the rest of the money

30:19.050 --> 30:22.440
[when he is delivered alive
and in our hands.]

30:24.450 --> 30:27.112
- I don't want Dr. Lecter

30:27.150 --> 30:30.415
near Florence when you...
- [I understand your concern.]

30:30.460 --> 30:33.054
[Don't worry, he won't be.]

30:33.090 --> 30:36.150
[Toodle-oo.]

30:43.140 --> 30:45.438
- Hannibal is going
to kill him, you know.

31:04.190 --> 31:07.899
(waltz playing)
- Dr. Fell?

31:21.440 --> 31:25.672
- Buonasera, commendatore.
- Buonasera, Dottore Fell.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.871
- Back so soon?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.280
- Given the nature
of your...

31:33.320 --> 31:37.211
exhibition and the contents
of our last conversation,

31:37.260 --> 31:39.683
I brought something I thought

31:39.730 --> 31:42.119
you might like to see.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.569
It was supposedly worn
by Francesco de Pazzi

31:53.610 --> 31:57.330
when he met his end.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.269
My family guilt cast in iron.

32:04.520 --> 32:08.718
- A scold's bridle.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.149
May I?
- Of course.

32:25.670 --> 32:28.036
- A wonderful heirloom.

32:31.010 --> 32:34.377
I'm so glad you stopped by,
Commendatore Pazzi, as I...

32:34.420 --> 32:36.411
have a family
heirloom for you.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.378
Beneath the figure
is written a name.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.024
Can you make it out?
- It says, "Pazzi."

32:50.060 --> 32:52.528
- This is your
ancestor, Francesco,

32:52.570 --> 32:54.765
hanging outside the Palazzo.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.065
This particular
illustration

32:58.110 --> 33:00.431
is bowels out. _
I've seen others bowels in.

33:00.470 --> 33:03.598
By all accounts,
Francesco was led astray

33:03.640 --> 33:06.677
by thirty pieces of silver from
the hand of the Papal banker.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.178
It's hard to see,

33:12.220 --> 33:14.484
but here's where
the archbishop bit him.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.455
Eyes wild as he choked,

33:17.490 --> 33:19.481
the archbishop
locked his teeth

33:19.530 --> 33:22.556
in Pazzi's flesh.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.626
On a related subject,
I must confess,

33:25.670 --> 33:30.039
I've been giving very serious
thought to doing the same.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.128
- Thank you.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.492
- He said he would be
home by now.

33:58.100 --> 34:01.024
What has he done?

34:23.220 --> 34:27.429
- Can you hear me, Signor Pazzi?

34:27.460 --> 34:30.452
Take a deep breath
while you can.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.526
Clear your head.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.786
I haven't had a bite all day.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.853
Actually, your liver and kidneys

35:00.890 --> 35:03.120
would be suitable
for dinner right away...

35:07.570 --> 35:10.198
Tonight, even,

35:10.240 --> 35:12.708
but the rest of the meat
should hang at least a week

35:12.740 --> 35:14.731
in the current
cool conditions.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.648
I didn't see the
forecast, did you?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.313
I gather that means "no."

35:23.350 --> 35:25.215
If you tell me

35:25.250 --> 35:28.686
what I need to know,
commendatore, it would be
convenient for me

35:28.720 --> 35:31.382
_ toleave
Without my meal.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.819
I will ask you the questions
and then we'll see.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.624
You can trust me, you know,

35:36.660 --> 35:39.663
though I expect

35:39.700 --> 35:41.691
that you find trust difficult,
knowing yourself.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.709
When the police didn't come,

35:44.740 --> 35:48.232
it was clear that you had sold
me. Was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

35:50.540 --> 35:53.646
Thank you.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.615
I called the number on
his "wanted" site once,

35:56.650 --> 35:59.187
far from here, just for fun.

36:04.590 --> 36:08.526
Have you told anyone
at the Questura about me?

36:08.560 --> 36:11.267
Was that a nod?

36:17.770 --> 36:21.809
(cell phone buzzing)
Pronto.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.503
- Inspector Pazzi.
My name is Alana Bloom.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.815
[You don't know me, but I know
your benefactor--]
- Hello, Alana.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.353
I'm afraid the inspector
is otherwise occupied.

36:34.390 --> 36:37.655
- Is he dead?

36:37.690 --> 36:41.353
- [There is nothing I would
love more_than to be able
to chat With you, Alana,]

36:41.400 --> 36:44.198
but you caught me
at a rather awkward moment.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.195
Nice to hear your voice.

36:53.770 --> 36:55.738
So, commendatore,

36:55.780 --> 36:58.476
which do you think?

36:59.680 --> 37:01.978
Bowels in or bowels out?

37:04.650 --> 37:06.379
Out, I think.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.320
(creaking sound)

38:03.640 --> 38:05.449
Hello, Jack.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.315
Did you get my note?

38:20.590 --> 38:23.525
I am truly sorry about Bella.

38:25.730 --> 38:29.734
For her, night and day must've
been very much the same
in the end.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.544
When she could
no longer stir or speak,

38:38.580 --> 38:40.639
did you speak for her?

38:43.950 --> 38:47.738
I imagine you were capable
of giving any medication Bella
may have needed in the night.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.389
Did you practice injections
on an orange, Jack?

38:53.430 --> 38:56.593
(waltz playing)

38:58.770 --> 39:01.091
What medication
did you give her in the end?

39:03.100 --> 39:05.102
Was it too much?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.877
Or just enough?

40:17.210 --> 40:19.644
(cracking sound)

40:19.680 --> 40:23.810
I brought Bella back from death
and you returned her to it.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.083
Is that Where
you're taking me, Jack?

41:34.690 --> 41:36.885
How will you feel when I'm gone?

41:43.100 --> 41:44.863
- Alive.

42:30.240 --> 42:34.040
