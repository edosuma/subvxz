00:39.572 --> 00:42.268
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.535
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.308
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.681 --> 00:50.205
This is lsabelle.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.682
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone

00:53.853 --> 00:55.878
for understanding what happened
to the 4400.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.081
- Are you my mother?
- Your rapid aging

00:58.258 --> 01:00.658
has caused her rapid aging.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.761
The only way for you to live
is for me to die.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.727
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?

01:05.899 --> 01:07.628
P.I. Promicin inhibitor.

01:07.801 --> 01:08.961
We did it to them, Tom.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.463
- We made them sick.
- We are in a war.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.503
This is a message
from The Nova Group.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.538
The second demonstration
of our capabilities

01:15.708 --> 01:17.539
is planned for October 19th.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.234
You think I'm gonna
write you a check?

01:19.412 --> 01:20.401
I need it tomorrow.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.413
We couldn't even handle one when
she walked in and attacked the place.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.074
Now there's a whole team
of assassins, all with abilities?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.345
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center

01:28.521 --> 01:30.455
in case the government
ever came after us again.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.783
You lied to me, Daniel.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.823
You never said anything
about killing people.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.451
You sold us out.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.591
You did the right thing
by calling me, Shawn.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.091
You're a hero.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.134
- Hey, I'm Tyler.
- Maia.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.472
- Where are we?
- This is where they altered us.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.404
Gave me the ability
to create the world

01:50.577 --> 01:53.137
we've been living in
for the last eight years.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.803
People see her, they see a woman.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.347
And they might forget that inside,
she's just a little girl.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.784
I'm glad she had you around
to be a friend.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.786
You are ticklish.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.363
Cut it out.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.990
- That bothers me.
- It bothers you?

02:16.169 --> 02:18.228
It didn't seem to bother you
a few minutes ago.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.342
- I could hold you like this.
- You could hold me like this?

02:27.514 --> 02:28.572
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:29.549 --> 02:30.743
What about that?

02:36.723 --> 02:38.691
Oh, don't answer it. Don't answer it.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.985
I have to.
I'm still the boss around here.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.924
I have to.

02:52.906 --> 02:53.895
Richard, hey.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.234
Sorry to bother you.
I was waiting for you in your office.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.706
Oh, you know--

02:57.877 --> 03:00.437
Yeah, sorry, I'm just running
a little late this morning. What's up?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.604
Before Lily-- Before she passed,

03:02.782 --> 03:05.410
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.678
The healing work you do
was really important to her.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.948
I remember.
I'm glad to have you aboard.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.921
- What do you need?
- A better head for numbers.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.925
I've been trying to decipher
these financial reports.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.756
There's some
pretty big cash payments.

03:18.932 --> 03:19.921
You signed the transfers,

03:20.099 --> 03:21.930
I figured you might remember
what they were for.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.765
No idea. I'm sorry, no idea.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.237
Just checking.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.901
See you soon.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.315
Maybe we should tell him.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.785
No. No, I don't think so.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.582
We just...

03:43.756 --> 03:47.317
We just gotta be more careful
from now on, okay?

03:50.597 --> 03:52.292
Okay.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.333
Thank you for doing this, Thomas.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.995
I know an open house at the Center
isn't your favorite Sunday activity.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.836
I love a good barbecue.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.477
You've been spending
a lot of time here.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.478
If this place is important to you,
it's important to me.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.173
I don't believe you,
but I love you for saying it.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.650
And don't be nervous, everyone here
is going to love you too.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.346
So help me out here, Tom.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.286
You say you love Alana,

04:19.459 --> 04:23.293
and yet she's a 4400
and you're an NTAC agent.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.956
I mean, if I were you
and I really loved her, I'd quit that job.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.961
First of all, you're not me.
You don't know anything about me.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.437
You don't know anything
about this relationship and frankly,

04:35.608 --> 04:36.870
I doubt you know much
about NTAC.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.307
Well, they did almost kill us all.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.970
Thanks for the input, Ryan.
Nice chatting with you.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.112
I am so sorry, Thomas.
He's usually not that rude.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.720
We've been here an hour.
I've had four conversations like that.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.823
- You think we can call it a day?
- Alana?

04:53.159 --> 04:55.559
I didn't realize your Thomas
was Tom Baldwin.

04:55.728 --> 04:59.027
- Remember me?
- Heather Tobey.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.166
Nice to see a friendly face.
How are you?

05:01.534 --> 05:05.061
I couldn't be better.
Tom was my hero.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.371
Oh, you mean Heather
was one of your assignments?

05:08.541 --> 05:09.667
Yeah, about eight months ago.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.366
Back when I first got my ability.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.138
Heather, you seem great.
What are you up to?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.613
I teach at the school here now.
It's a good match, huh?

05:17.784 --> 05:20.116
Finally found a place where
they won't run me out on the rails

05:20.286 --> 05:21.412
for being a 4400.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.452
And now Alana and l
are gonna be working together.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.250
Isn't that cool?

05:27.460 --> 05:32.193
I've been offered a job
working with the children at the school.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.996
But I haven't decided
if I'm going to take it yet.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.164
I blew the surprise, didn't l?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.144
So help me out here.
Who is Amy again?

05:45.311 --> 05:48.405
- Is she a 4400?
- Everyone in my class is a 4400.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.845
She wants me to come over tomorrow.
It's not a huge deal.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.279
Oh, it's not?

05:52.452 --> 05:55.012
I guess when you put it like that,
then there's no way I can say no.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.985
- Where's your sweater?
- I left it upstairs.

05:57.156 --> 05:58.783
Run and get it.
It's freezing by the water.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.016
We're gonna miss the ferry.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.253
- You're gonna forget me.
- Excuse me?

06:05.665 --> 06:08.225
You're gonna forget me. I saw it.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.132
Maia, do you mind explaining that?

06:10.303 --> 06:12.601
Because frankly,
it sounds a little creepy.

06:13.272 --> 06:16.139
It's okay. It's not your fault.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.945
Maia, listen to me.
I would never forget you.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.743
Not ever.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.748
Come on, you know that, don't you?

06:29.188 --> 06:30.951
I'll be right back.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.015
Okay.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.263
Maia, come on.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.968
Come on, sweetie.
We're gonna miss the boat, literally.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.638
- Maia, come here right now.
- Mommy, it's okay. It's fine.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.175
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

06:52.345 --> 06:54.336
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

06:54.514 --> 06:58.644
I was just knocking on your door
when Maia came upstairs.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.343
It's so great.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.489
- Tell her.
- Tell me what?

07:04.056 --> 07:07.992
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sara.
Sara Rutledge.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.026
I'm Maia's sister.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.420
That's Lemon. He was my dog.

08:19.599 --> 08:24.263
I know. He slept on your bed,
every night, right until he died.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.572
You really lived in my house?

08:27.907 --> 08:31.365
22 White Oak Lane, Crescent City.

08:31.544 --> 08:36.447
- My room was at the top of the stairs.
- I know. It was always your room.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.607
Mom and Dad kept it all the same,
just for you.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.548
They missed you so much.

08:41.721 --> 08:46.055
Maia, I need you to give me
some time alone with Sara.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.459
Did Daddy teach you to play poker?

08:48.694 --> 08:51.288
- We played for Tootsie Rolls.
- Maia.

08:54.734 --> 08:58.033
I think your mom needs
a word with me, sweetie.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.178
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sandbag you.

09:10.349 --> 09:11.543
I was gonna leave a note.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.413
I've been trying to find you for years.

09:14.587 --> 09:15.918
Every phone number out of date.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.613
Every letter comes back
return to sender.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.418
Guyana? The lvory Coast?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.051
I've been hard to find.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.663
Hard to find?
I didn't know if you were alive or dead.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.732
Which, I'm guessing,
is why you never told Maia about me.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.938
I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to say?

09:37.109 --> 09:38.508
"Sweetheart,
you have an older sister,

09:38.678 --> 09:42.341
but it doesn't seem like she's
terribly interested in meeting you"?

09:44.850 --> 09:46.647
I'm sorry.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.419
I should have called first.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.923
I just felt like
I needed to do this in person.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.562
I just want to know her.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.358
That's all.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.763
You think it's that easy?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.062
There are a lot of people
who would do anything

10:05.237 --> 10:06.704
to get close to a 4400.

10:06.872 --> 10:10.501
Until you can prove to me
that you are who you say you are,

10:10.676 --> 10:12.769
you're not seeing
my daughter again.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.608
I understand.
I'm willing to take a DNA test.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.306
That's a good start.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.313
You didn't even tell me
you were thinking about teaching,

10:22.488 --> 10:23.580
that the possibility existed.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.021
To be honest, I was avoiding it.
I know how you feel about the Center.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.787
No, I'm fine with the Center.
They're not fine with me.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.756
What about your gallery?

10:33.933 --> 10:38.461
I can still do all the buying
and Tina can handle sales.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.165
Look, I'm sorry
if this seems just sudden.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.366
I told them about my ability
at the Center,

10:44.543 --> 10:46.374
and they thought
they could use it at the school.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.910
You're gonna use your ability?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.480
Don't you think that's why
we came back here with these gifts?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.140
To help other people?

10:52.485 --> 10:56.046
Yeah, yeah. No, it sounds great.
I just didn't think that...

10:58.124 --> 10:59.751
I mean, does it even work
with other people?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.655
I did an experiment with Heather.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.228
We went to Paris for lunch.

11:06.465 --> 11:10.561
Don't worry,
I don't think my batteries run out.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.001
I'll save my best work for you.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.505
I promise.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.703
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our experiment,

11:20.880 --> 11:22.780
I guess you'd call it.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.973
We've never tried
a healing this large,

11:25.151 --> 11:28.348
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.520
Before I begin,

11:30.690 --> 11:35.684
I'd like to say that this foundation
was started by my late wife, Lily Tyler.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.822
I'm proud to be carrying on
her work.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.091
She's the reason
why we are all here today.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.435
Well, her and a man
I'm about to introduce to you.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.929
Shawn Farrell.

11:50.843 --> 11:51.867
Thank you.

11:52.044 --> 11:57.209
Okay, first off, kids,
I promise this is not gonna hurt.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.452
Listen, I'd like to ask
everyone here a favor.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.278
When you leave here today,

12:04.457 --> 12:07.324
and you will be leaving
the hospital today,

12:07.493 --> 12:12.226
please tell anyone that asks
that a 4400 made you better.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.831
Made your children better.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.832
Because we're not bogeymen,
we're here to help.

12:17.002 --> 12:21.234
- So let's get this thing started.
- Traitor! Traitor to your own kind.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.408
Next time it won't be paint.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.674
You okay?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.513
Yeah.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.851
It's in her file.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.283
Maia's parents had a baby
five years after she disappeared

12:36.455 --> 12:38.150
and her name was Sara.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.655
So it is possible.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.419
No word at all for two years
and then she just shows up.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.995
- You think she's the real deal?
- I don't know. Maybe.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.495
What does your gut tell you?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.565
Oh, it tells me that
she's not gonna see Maia again

12:48.734 --> 12:50.827
until the DNA tests come back.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.664
Smart gut.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.198
Her name is Lindsey Hammond.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.275
She disappeared
November 23rd, 1 979.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.208
You know, just once I wish a 4400
would smile for their picture.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.438
Is that too much to ask?

13:03.082 --> 13:05.141
Since her return she's been living
with her stepfather.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.477
Until yesterday, that is.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.046
What, she's missing?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.812
Well, her stepfather thinks
she ran away.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.587
Take a drive out to her house.
See if we need to be worried.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.422
That just came in.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.960
The attack at the hospital
this morning wasn't random.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.628
Somehow you've become a target
of the Nova Group.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.832
Any idea why?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.643
Two months ago,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.209
someone called me.

13:37.383 --> 13:42.150
They were trying to raise money
to start a defensive wing of the 4400.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.380
I made a couple of contributions.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.889
You gave money
to the Nova Group?

13:48.427 --> 13:50.190
Shawn, they murdered
half a dozen people.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.954
That was after.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.689
Do you think I would have
given them money

13:53.866 --> 13:55.697
if I thought that
they were gonna hurt anybody?

13:56.368 --> 13:58.768
When they came back
asking for more, I said no.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.566
You got the money
from the foundation, didn't you?

14:01.740 --> 14:04.106
That's what all those signatures
were for.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.107
You diverted money from my wife's
foundation to a terrorist group?

14:08.280 --> 14:10.339
Richard, it was a mistake.
I know that.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.450
Don't you think I know that?

14:16.956 --> 14:17.945
I'll serve to you.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.524
We have to try to keep it going
for as long as we can, okay?

14:29.969 --> 14:31.698
Maia?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.537
Where's Maia?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.043
She's at a friend's house.
A girl from the class. Why?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.374
Preliminary DNA came back.
Negative match.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.744
Sara isn't Maia's sister.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.149
Where's Maia?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.786
They're in the yard.
Is everything okay?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.832
Maia!

15:01.267 --> 15:03.235
- She left.
- Where did she go?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.495
She went with that lady. Her sister.

15:12.811 --> 15:16.178
Her picture's already on the wire.
An AMBER Alert's been issued.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.248
- We'll find her, Diana.
- I know we will.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.045
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.518
We're monitoring every tollbooth,
every intersection we can.

15:23.689 --> 15:26.180
If Sara shows up on any of them,
we can be there in minutes.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.258
You're gonna keep an eye
on things yourself, right?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.327
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.
- Okay.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.522
- Tom, what did the lab say?
- Nothing good.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.133
They ran the fingerprints from
your apartment and the DNA samples

15:36.302 --> 15:38.896
against every known database.
No names came up.

15:39.071 --> 15:41.301
So she has Maia,
we have no idea who she is.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.997
No.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.911
She said I was going to forget her.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.557
Mom really kept my room
just like I left it?

16:08.734 --> 16:10.031
Sure she did.

16:10.202 --> 16:13.467
She always believed
that you were gonna come home.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.668
Maia, can I ask you a question?

16:18.210 --> 16:19.734
Do you see the future more clearly

16:19.912 --> 16:22.380
since you stopped taking
the inhibitor?

16:22.548 --> 16:28.578
Well, at first I couldn't control it.
I thought I was going crazy.

16:28.754 --> 16:32.656
But now I can see the future,
more when I want to.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.555
It doesn't really
sneak up on me anymore.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.697
- Not much anyway.
- That's great.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.196
You're learning to focus your ability.

16:41.367 --> 16:45.497
What if I asked you
to predict something right now?

16:48.207 --> 16:49.731
Wait.

16:55.614 --> 16:56.706
We can go now.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.448
You are a very special girl.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.693
What do you think?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.089
This is your house?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.230
I bought it so I can stay in Seattle.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.096
We've spent enough time apart,
don't you think?

17:16.769 --> 17:21.262
Come on, let me show you the inside.
There's a surprise.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.143
Oh, my gosh.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.041
It's just like my old room.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.742
I told you Mom kept it the same,
else how would I know?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.398
Sorry to interrupt.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.938
Hoping I could have a word.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.667
Matthew.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.838
Come on in. What's on your mind?

18:06.485 --> 18:10.012
I was brought into this organization
by Jordan Collier.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.521
I didn't always know
what he had in mind for it,

18:12.691 --> 18:16.684
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.763
Six months after I came aboard,
he died.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.127
My new boss was a 1 9-year-old boy.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.002
This is about Shawn?

18:25.170 --> 18:26.728
He's overwhelmed, Richard.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.840
Running this Center
requires substantive decisions.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.135
Decisions that he's not qualified
to make.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.144
But you, on the other hand...

18:35.314 --> 18:37.714
You were an officer.
You led men into battle.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.681
Stop. Shawn runs things here.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.447
I am not interested
in a palace coup.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.284
I'm not talking about
getting rid of him.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.651
I'm talking about power-sharing.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.764
The two of you
make decisions together.

18:53.932 --> 18:54.956
It's a way of helping him.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.466
Giving him the benefit
of your experience.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.538
This is all very flattering.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.197
I'm not trying to flatter you.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.240
I'm trying to keep
this movement alive.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.204
Think about it.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.870
And before you say no,
I want you to tell me,

19:10.048 --> 19:12.380
could you,
under any circumstances,

19:12.551 --> 19:16.385
see yourself inadvertently
funding a terrorist attack?

19:24.296 --> 19:25.558
Look familiar?

19:25.731 --> 19:28.256
Maia's been drawing it a lot
the last few days.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.492
You sure? It's all
through the margins of her journals.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.035
Well, I've never seen it before,
but she likes butterflies.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.573
It might just be a doodle.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.834
You find anything else?
Anything we can use?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.774
It's hard to say. I mean,
it's all stream of consciousness.

19:40.946 --> 19:44.507
Predictions about big events right next
to tiny things in her everyday life.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.412
And there's no dates.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.886
Oh, did find out how I'm gonna die.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.419
Yeah, that was interesting.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.281
Don't worry, it's actually kind of cool.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.693
She did mention a friend's house.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.023
Just referred to the mom, though.
Mrs. Paspalis.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.189
Amy Paspalis.
That's the house she was taken from.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.526
Great, show us that page.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.765
Spooky. I could spend the rest
of my career working on these things.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.706
- Come on, Marco, just--
- Yeah, yeah.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.867
Here.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.640
"Mommy's coming to pick me up
from Mrs. Paspalis' house,

20:16.815 --> 20:20.876
but I'm already gone.
I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."

20:21.787 --> 20:22.776
Tyler Downing?

20:23.722 --> 20:26.987
- lsn't he a 4400?
- He goes to school with Maia.

20:27.159 --> 20:30.287
I told you, I didn't do anything to Maia.
I swear.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.020
Look, nobody thinks
that you did anything.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.764
I just need you
to try and remember.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.467
Now, did she ever talk to you
about a circle?

20:38.403 --> 20:41.065
Did she ever mention having visions
about the two of you?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.936
No. I said already ten times,
I'm not lying.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.805
Ma'am, I know you're worried
about your kid,

20:46.979 --> 20:49.675
but you're scaring the crap
out of my brother.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.939
Diana.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.615
There's nothing here.
There's no sign of Maia or the woman.

20:55.988 --> 20:59.014
"I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."
Tyler's here, so where is Maia?

20:59.191 --> 21:00.180
I don't know.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.259
Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.554
Is it a street? Barnaby Circle?
There's a Circle Park--

21:04.730 --> 21:07.756
We need to check them all, because
she's trying to tell me how to find her.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.711
Sara?

21:25.817 --> 21:28.217
Is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?

21:31.223 --> 21:32.554
Sara?

21:40.966 --> 21:44.629
Sara, the door won't open.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.430
Sara?

21:48.774 --> 21:52.175
You can yell all you want,
she won't come.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.278
She never does.

21:56.381 --> 21:57.473
Who are you?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.239
I'm Lindsey.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.186
I'm a part of her collection.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.186
We all are.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.592
Now you are too.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.330
All of us are 4400s?

22:18.904 --> 22:21.771
What is she gonna do to us?

22:21.940 --> 22:24.204
Sell us to the highest bidder
or do experiments?

22:24.376 --> 22:26.435
I mean, who knows?

22:27.312 --> 22:31.248
It doesn't matter.
We're not gonna let it come to that.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.762
Hello?

23:00.112 --> 23:02.273
That was incredible.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.515
Hi.

23:05.684 --> 23:09.381
Oh, hi, Thomas.
I didn't hear you come in.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.717
Any word about Maia?

23:12.891 --> 23:15.485
Sorry to invade your house, Tom.
Alana and I were just practicing.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.756
I think I might take that job
at the school.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.863
Heather and l
were just trying something.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.933
Don't be shy about it.

23:24.102 --> 23:26.900
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.300
We just watched Richard Nixon

23:28.473 --> 23:30.941
fly away from the White House
after he resigned.

23:31.376 --> 23:33.241
It's remarkable, huh?

23:34.045 --> 23:35.842
Well, Alana's an amazing woman.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.112
She certainly is.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.659
Are you all right, Thomas?

23:50.395 --> 23:52.556
I'm fine. I'm just...

23:54.065 --> 23:55.657
I'm just worried for Diana.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.632
She's strong. And so are you.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.837
After Heather leaves,
you want me to take you somewhere?

24:05.010 --> 24:07.035
It might calm you down some.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.607
No, I think
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.181
Hit the investigation
fresh in the morning.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.118
So things are going well
between you and Shawn?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.955
Yeah, I think so.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.563
We're having lots of sex.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.524
Has he said, "l love you," yet?

24:30.702 --> 24:32.294
No.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.699
Do you think he should have?

24:36.074 --> 24:38.042
Try this.

24:41.713 --> 24:44.773
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.281
Men can do things with their bodies

24:46.451 --> 24:49.147
entirely unrelated
to their hearts and minds.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.552
Shawn likes me. It's real.

24:52.891 --> 24:53.983
Good.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.559
Shawn's gonna be having
a difficult time these next few days.

24:56.728 --> 24:59.561
He's gonna have
some decisions to make.

24:59.731 --> 25:02.894
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.696
You want me to use him?

25:07.873 --> 25:09.773
Use him?

25:09.941 --> 25:11.602
What does that even mean?

25:11.776 --> 25:15.906
You're getting close to Shawn, right?
So he'll value your advice.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.641
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.614
I guess.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.412
What do you want me
to say to him?

25:22.587 --> 25:24.452
Just the truth.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.955
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.

25:27.125 --> 25:31.084
It's not a sign of weakness,
it's a display of strength.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.054
Wear that.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.363
Hey, kid,

25:41.540 --> 25:43.974
you have to try to be quiet, okay?

25:44.142 --> 25:46.303
I just wanna go home.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.872
We all do,
but crying is not going to help.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.875
Listen, we can do stuff they can't.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.147
That's why they want us.
But maybe we can use it against them,

25:58.323 --> 26:01.656
maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.423
Everyone tell me
what you can do, okay?

26:05.597 --> 26:08.122
My sister and me,

26:08.300 --> 26:10.598
we can make water move.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.202
Back and forth.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.998
Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.

26:15.173 --> 26:16.470
Diffusion.

26:17.108 --> 26:18.598
Yeah.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.938
We have to be together
to do it, though.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.003
What about you, kid?

26:23.181 --> 26:26.981
I do stuff with electricity. Currents.

26:27.552 --> 26:30.282
I can make machines in my kitchen
stop working.

26:30.455 --> 26:33.151
Okay, good, that will come in handy.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.521
I can see things.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.596
Things that are gonna happen.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.196
Really? That's awesome.

26:43.368 --> 26:44.960
Can you tell
if they're gonna keep us here?

26:45.470 --> 26:47.836
Are they gonna let us go?

26:48.640 --> 26:49.698
Come on, tell us.

26:53.678 --> 26:55.543
We're not gonna be here long.

26:56.214 --> 26:58.205
Why? Do we get to go home?

27:00.018 --> 27:01.542
I don't think so.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.880
Sorry I asked.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.816
Listen, I don't know
about the rest of you,

27:05.991 --> 27:09.154
but I'm gonna try to figure out
a way to get us out of here.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.992
Are you guys up for it?

27:55.507 --> 28:01.537
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Stop it! Let me go!

28:01.713 --> 28:03.340
Help me! Let me go!

28:03.515 --> 28:08.851
Help! Somebody! Let me go! Help!

28:14.325 --> 28:15.417
Tyler Downing wasn't home

28:15.593 --> 28:18.221
when his sister got back
from her waitressing shift last night.

28:18.396 --> 28:21.661
My God,
that's the third 4400 kid missing.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.391
No, try five.

28:25.403 --> 28:26.734
Olivia and Duncan Germaine's
parents

28:26.905 --> 28:29.339
thought they went on a camping trip
with their youth group.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.566
It turns out they never showed.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.112
Tom, update me, here.

28:38.283 --> 28:39.773
What are we doing
to find this woman?

28:39.951 --> 28:43.387
Well, Maia's journal said she was
inside the circle with Tyler Downing.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.949
We've checked out every street
with the name Circle in it.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.456
Skyline Circle Park,
Circle Theatre on First Hill.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.253
There's nothing yet.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.623
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.

28:52.797 --> 28:53.923
We've already looked.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.366
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in Denny Park.

28:57.535 --> 29:00.299
- Maybe there.
- It's over here.

29:01.806 --> 29:04.434
Hey, I thought you could use a jolt.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.338
Thanks.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.945
I didn't get much sleep last night.

29:09.714 --> 29:11.648
Any, actually. This helps.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.780
You were up all night?

29:13.952 --> 29:17.217
You should go lay down
in the Theory Room for an hour.

29:20.658 --> 29:22.182
Tom.

29:24.562 --> 29:26.996
Diana, are you all right?

29:27.165 --> 29:28.689
Look.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.936
"I'm in the circle."

29:36.808 --> 29:38.139
I don't believe this.

29:38.676 --> 29:42.806
I tell you the truth
and you use it to kick me out?

29:42.981 --> 29:46.178
No, Shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.750
You've got an impossible job.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.820
Jordan Collier left me
in charge of this place.

29:50.989 --> 29:54.117
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.788
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.324
The Center
has a board of directors, Shawn.

30:00.498 --> 30:03.729
And Collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.234
They approved it because
that's what Jordan wanted, Matthew.

30:06.404 --> 30:08.736
If Jordan was here, his thoughts
on succession might change

30:08.907 --> 30:11.899
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the United States government.

30:12.677 --> 30:16.340
You've made yourself and this place
a target for terrorists.

30:16.514 --> 30:18.038
Shawn,

30:18.817 --> 30:20.512
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,

30:21.186 --> 30:23.313
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.477
You need help.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.316
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.154
- I am.
- Really?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.353
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.394
- Tyler, you have to talk to us.
- No.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.563
If we get out of the house, can you
make it so their cars can't start?

30:42.740 --> 30:45.402
No, I'm not helping.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.511
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl?

30:47.679 --> 30:51.115
They took her away.
I don't wanna go away.

30:51.282 --> 30:55.116
You will.
We all will if we don't do something.

31:31.689 --> 31:35.090
Lindsey. Lindsey, are you okay?

31:39.931 --> 31:40.920
Who are you?

31:42.233 --> 31:44.292
What did they do to you?

31:46.471 --> 31:48.268
Maia, do you wanna come
with me, please?

31:48.940 --> 31:50.373
No.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.338
It's okay, sweetie.
It's not so bad. I promise.

31:56.414 --> 32:00.908
Tyler! Duncan!
Please, somebody help me!

32:01.085 --> 32:03.053
Help!

32:13.998 --> 32:17.297
Seattle P.D. has the south edge.
We'll take center and work east.

32:18.036 --> 32:20.129
It would be nice if we knew
what we were looking for.

32:20.305 --> 32:21.602
A message.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.968
A sign.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.110
Anything.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.817
Do you like this?

32:34.986 --> 32:36.783
You are seriously asking?

32:37.388 --> 32:41.484
I knew you would.
I picked it out just for you.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.825
Green's your favorite color, isn't it?

32:44.996 --> 32:46.520
I can tell.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.529
I know you now.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.069
Isabelle, lsabelle.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.734
I'm not really ready
for another round right now, okay?

33:01.913 --> 33:03.471
What are you so worried about?

33:03.915 --> 33:07.407
If you don't wanna share
your job, don't.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.177
What are you talking about?

33:11.189 --> 33:14.488
I can do things, Shawn.
Lots of them.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.559
I figure out more every day.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.025
If you wanna keep your job,
you can.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.166
I can make it happen.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.399
You can do whatever.
Who's gonna say different?

33:28.639 --> 33:30.197
Thanks, I guess.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.936
But why don't you just hold off
on the air strikes, okay?

33:34.779 --> 33:37.009
We're talking about
your dad and Matthew here.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.876
It's just an argument.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.176
They're not the enemy.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.918
Besides, they do have a point,
don't they?

33:44.088 --> 33:46.579
I did screw up.

33:47.058 --> 33:48.992
Okay.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.855
Just so you know, it's your call.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.060
Drink this.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.897
It'll make you feel better.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.344
You're frightened.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.710
It's all right, I understand.
But you don't have to be.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.783
We're not gonna hurt you.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.643
Soon you won't
even be worried anymore.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.083
I promise.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.523
These are just to relax you.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.788
They'll help you get ready.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.891
Now, drink up, okay?
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.438
No.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.071
Maia.

35:09.574 --> 35:12.372
They're doing it. They're helping.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.093
Take Dexter south.
Swing back around for another pass.

35:33.264 --> 35:35.289
- Wait, Tom. Stop. Stop.
- What?

35:37.835 --> 35:40.269
It's those butterflies.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.464
They're in Maia's journals.
She's here.

35:55.686 --> 35:57.620
All right, let's go. Secure the area.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.663
Maia.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.373
- What is going on?
- Don't move!

36:24.215 --> 36:25.204
Please.

36:25.383 --> 36:29.410
Please, this house is for sale,
all the valuables are gone.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.738
Is this a dream?

36:51.609 --> 36:53.406
No, honey.

36:54.312 --> 36:57.907
Remember the first time you
were taken away from your parents?

36:58.082 --> 36:59.379
This is where we brought you.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.383
- No, this isn't real.
- Yes, it is.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.456
We've brought you back.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.190
You've been here ever since
you walked through the front door

37:10.361 --> 37:11.828
of my house.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.486
You're in the future.

37:14.932 --> 37:18.129
We had to bring you here, Maia.
You and your friends.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.231
We need your help.

37:29.213 --> 37:31.738
It'll all be over soon.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.077
Please let me go.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.776
I wanna go home.

37:35.953 --> 37:38.786
I'm afraid you can't.
You're too important.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.286
Sweetheart,

37:41.959 --> 37:44.587
the experiment we tried is failing.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.491
There's been too much interference.

37:48.232 --> 37:51.599
The 4400
haven't changed the timeline.

37:52.703 --> 37:55.536
The catastrophe, it's still coming.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.208
We found a way to fix it.

37:59.377 --> 38:00.844
You and your friends,

38:02.246 --> 38:04.908
you're gonna save us all.

38:09.020 --> 38:13.980
We found it all.
You know, the circle, the butterflies.

38:15.526 --> 38:18.723
She's here.
I mean, she has to be here.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.397
Come on, I'll take you home.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.316
Sign here.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.919
Can you sign here?

38:48.826 --> 38:49.884
Thank you, Shawn.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.461
I know this wasn't an easy decision.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.394
Yeah, well,

39:01.572 --> 39:04.370
we all want the same things, right?

39:05.176 --> 39:07.201
You're a good man, Shawn.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.440
It's an honor to be working with you.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.819
Why are you giving this to me?

39:19.990 --> 39:21.685
To thank you.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.087
You did well.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.759
Everything went smoothly
with Shawn.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.961
I disobeyed you, Matthew.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.629
I told Shawn he should keep his job.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.702
I disobeyed you
and you know what?

39:38.876 --> 39:41.037
Nothing happened.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.406
There wasn't an earthquake.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.511
I didn't melt.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.311
I used to be scared of you.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.783
But I don't think you have
any power over me at all, do you?

40:08.038 --> 40:09.300
I didn't think so.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.438
I'll do my own shopping
from now on, okay?

40:20.317 --> 40:23.582
Okay, sweetheart,
we're ready to begin.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.154
Don't cry.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.949
You and the other children
we took,

40:29.126 --> 40:32.186
we tested your abilities
and you are so special.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.263
That's why you were chosen.

40:34.698 --> 40:37.394
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

40:37.568 --> 40:39.331
We're gonna put you all back.

40:39.503 --> 40:42.233
Not the same year
we took you from, but earlier.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.397
Much earlier.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.839
We calculated wrong the first time.

40:47.011 --> 40:48.774
We have to try again.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.608
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.

40:52.116 --> 40:56.052
I don't care.
I don't wanna go anywhere.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.656
I wanna stay with my mom.

40:59.824 --> 41:00.950
I know.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.593
It's hard.

41:03.761 --> 41:06.229
I can make the pain go away.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.558
Before we put you back
in your new time,

41:08.732 --> 41:10.393
we'll make you forget your mother,

41:10.568 --> 41:13.560
Marco and your friends.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.729
- Please, don't.
- They'll forget you too.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.975
It's better this way.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.772
There'll be no sorrow,
no pain, no loss.

41:22.947 --> 41:24.175
As far as the world is concerned,

41:24.348 --> 41:29.149
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1 946 and was never found.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.220
That's a lie.

41:31.388 --> 41:34.482
My mom won't ever forget me.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.559
She will. It's happening already.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.993
Now, just lie still.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.030
All the hope we have rests with you.

41:46.203 --> 41:49.604
No, don't do it, please.

41:49.773 --> 41:52.537
Mommy!

42:16.834 --> 42:18.631
This should be good.
