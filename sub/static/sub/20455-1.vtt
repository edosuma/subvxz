02:52.339 --> 02:54.717
I'll bring you back a slice of cake.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.095
Get away from the window.

03:25.581 --> 03:31.879
Now don't forget.
Mr Punch, you will call me, won't you?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.811
This way, please.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.521
No, no, I'll take them.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.857
Look, Ma, it's gorgeous.

03:52.358 --> 03:56.111
Well, you're very welcome, Christy,
very welcome.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.489
To your humble abode.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.867
Oh, my humble abode.
Yes, well, I suppose so.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.753
Hello. My name is Mary.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.922
I'll be with you till you go on this evening.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.632
I have to take him into the library.

04:23.097 --> 04:26.225
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.396
Be careful of that fella.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.147
I'll be okay.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.734
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

04:53.076 --> 04:57.047
Now, you're all very welcome
to my humble abode,

04:57.131 --> 05:03.220
and to this benefit,
organised by my friend Dr Eileen Cole,

05:03.304 --> 05:05.306
Dr Eileen Cole.

05:09.101 --> 05:13.981
<i>Now I'm not going to ask you to put
your hands in your pockets, not yet,</i>

05:14.064 --> 05:19.278
<i>because we're going to start the evening
with a little concert.</i>

05:19.361 --> 05:20.821
Do you want to go out and watch?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.366
No.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.881
Do you want to see the original?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.550
The original?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.552
Of the book.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.706
It looks good.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.834
Looks can be deceivin'.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.129
It's a bit sentimental.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.760
Did you paint this?

06:24.843 --> 06:26.762
Yes.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.848
That's very good.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.198
Mr Brown?

07:28.282 --> 07:31.326
Your son was born a couple of hours ago.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.704
There's been some complications.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.171
Where's the small one?

07:42.254 --> 07:44.423
A pint and a small one?

07:44.506 --> 07:48.010
- That's what I said.
- So long as you're payin' for it.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.608
Are you gonna put him in a home, Paddy?

08:02.691 --> 08:06.361
He'll go in a coffin before
any son of mine will go in a home.

08:07.721 --> 08:13.452
Paddy... I believe it's the end of the road
for you in the breedin' stakes.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.080
Who told you that?

08:19.316 --> 08:22.420
Now... What are you goin' to do?

08:23.504 --> 08:25.082
Are you goin' to tie a knot in it?

08:29.218 --> 08:31.720
Now, Paddy, there was no need for that.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.933
A shut mouth catches no flies.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.823
Where's Tom?

08:51.907 --> 08:54.368
Is Tom not up yet?

08:59.998 --> 09:03.001
It's all right! I'm up! I'm up ages!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.597
Say goodbye to Christy, Father.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.933
Goodbye, Christy.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.978
Be a good girl. See you later.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.399
See you, Christy.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.069
- See you, Christy.
- Bye, Christy.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.878
Something for the money box, Christy.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.021
Another pound saved, Christy.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.367
Here, Christy.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.838
Good boy, that's it.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.764
I have to go away, Christy.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.058
To hospital.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.437
Don't worry, Sheila's going
to look after you while I'm gone.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.192
Do you understand, Christy?

11:04.206 --> 11:07.417
That's my Ma. That's my Da.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.463
I was their baby.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.885
It's only for a few days, Christy.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.974
I'd better get this house organised
before I go.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.647
You can't be stickin' to me
like stickin' plaster forever, Christy.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.051
Nearly there, Christy.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.166
Christy, I have to go and make a phone call.
Stay there.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.382
Oh, my God... Nan...

12:38.049 --> 12:40.594
Nan! Nan!

14:14.104 --> 14:17.566
I heard this terrible bangin' and rushed over.

14:17.649 --> 14:21.152
She was carryin' Christy down the stairs
when she fell.

14:21.236 --> 14:26.992
And there he was,
lyin' at the bottom of the stairs like a moron.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.537
God help her.
He's a terrible cross to the poor woman.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.623
Sure he has the mind of a three-year-old.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.587
A is for apples.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.131
B is for butter.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.387
C is for carrot.

14:52.684 --> 14:56.187
And D... is for dunce.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.109
Poor, unfortunate gobshite.

15:04.279 --> 15:09.367
Enough to feed an army.
God, you'll never go hungry, Christy.

15:20.462 --> 15:25.300
Would you like to come back with me
till your mammy comes home?

15:39.189 --> 15:41.691
What's 25% of a quarter?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.071
25% of a quarter?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.293
Now that's a stupid question.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.914
I mean, 25% is a quarter.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.583
You can't have a quarter of a quarter.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.461
You can. Can't you, Christy?

16:03.512 --> 16:04.589
What would he know?

16:20.355 --> 16:23.149
Ma! Ma, Christy picked up the chalk.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.953
Go on, Christy. Go on, make your mark.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.583
It's a Y.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.678
It's an X.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.271
- What's that, Christy?
- That's only an auld squiggle.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.079
There's something in that.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.416
Nah, don't be gettin' notions
into your head, woman.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.586
The child's a cripple. Face facts.

17:24.669 --> 17:28.882
It won't do anybody any good
trying to put ideas in his head.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.686
- Oh, that's great.
- We're gonna put the engine on now.

17:41.770 --> 17:45.023
- You're puttin' an engine in it?
- Yeah. Come on.

17:51.362 --> 17:55.241
Come on, engine.
All he needs now is a license.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.160
It's great!

18:01.414 --> 18:05.376
Take it easy, will ya?
Go on, take it easy.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.047
He'll play in that all day now.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.466
He can go out with the other boys now.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.887
- Look at those!
- They're massive!

18:17.472 --> 18:20.683
- What's that?
- That's her thing.

18:20.767 --> 18:26.106
You put your thing in there
for a half an hour and you get a baby.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.359
If you do it for an hour you get twins.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.903
My cousin's a twin.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.323
- Benny! Brian! Come on!
- There's your Ma.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.950
Quick, Tom. Here's Ma!

18:37.700 --> 18:39.536
- It's not my magazine!
- Is Benny in there?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.787
- Hide it!
- Where?

18:40.870 --> 18:43.790
- Just hide it!
- Are you deaf? Come in for your tea!

18:43.873 --> 18:46.251
- Hide it under Christy!
- Are you all deaf?

18:46.334 --> 18:49.963
I've been calling you for 20 minutes
to come in for your tea. Come on, Christy.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.674
- It's okay, Mam, we'll take him.
- Well, take him in now.

18:52.757 --> 18:56.052
It's been on the table
for at least a half an hour.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.404
See?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.045
Why won't he go to bed?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.841
He loves that auld chariot.

19:35.884 --> 19:40.430
Come on, get him up.
I want to go and have a pint.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.434
Come on, Christy.
It's way past your bedtime.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.478
It's nearly closin' time.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.830
Now, son, you know
you can never get out of Hell.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.790
You can get out of Purgatory

20:07.874 --> 20:10.710
but you can never get out of Hell.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.422
Do you know that?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.636
Do you?

20:23.264 --> 20:24.724
Mrs Brown...

20:28.811 --> 20:32.148
I don't think you should bring him
to the altar just yet.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.236
You've been very helpful, Father.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.892
Christy, do you know all
about All Souls' Night?

21:07.976 --> 21:10.270
Did I ever tell you about that?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.939
It's a very special night,
you know, because...

21:13.022 --> 21:15.275
every time that you light a candle
on All Souls' Night,

21:15.358 --> 21:17.819
you have to say five Our Fathers

21:17.902 --> 21:20.613
and five Hail Marys and five Glory Bes,

21:20.697 --> 21:25.702
and then a soul flies up out
of the flames of Purgatory

21:25.785 --> 21:28.746
and goes straight up to Heaven.

21:28.830 --> 21:32.166
Say some prayers for the poor souls in Purgatory.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.262
Right.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.976
What's wrong with you?

21:50.659 --> 21:52.186
Christy, keep your voice down.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.063
What's wrong with you, son?

21:54.847 --> 21:56.232
What's the matter with you?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.359
What do you want?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.820
Do you want to light another candle?
Is that it?

22:00.903 --> 22:04.407
Do you? For the poor souls?

22:04.490 --> 22:07.785
Good boy. That's a good boy.

22:07.869 --> 22:11.789
And don't forget, Christy,
if we can't understand you, God can.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.685
See, Christy?

22:32.769 --> 22:35.271
Even God has to lock his house.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.873
Look, Christy! There it is! Look!

22:53.956 --> 22:55.375
See, that's your soul going up to Heaven!

22:55.458 --> 22:58.878
Oh, look! Look, Christy. Oh, look.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.092
- You frightened the life out of him.
- Here, Christy.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.260
You're king of the bonfire.

23:10.014 --> 23:13.684
Don't be frightened, Christy.
It's only your brother- Tom.

23:13.768 --> 23:17.271
This way, Christy. This way.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.371
Get him over here!

23:58.062 --> 24:01.274
You all right, Christy?

24:01.357 --> 24:05.361
What's Christy doing, Sheila?
Is he all right?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.322
He's drawing.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.119
He's drawing a triangle.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.291
No, Christy, you don't start there.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.588
Here, son.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.474
Now, that's a triangle.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.520
That's not a triangle.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.898
That's an A.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.324
- What's up?
- Keep quiet.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.159
All I said was, "What's up?"

24:53.242 --> 24:54.410
Sit down!

25:01.542 --> 25:03.169
Here, Paddy.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.087
Why don't you go and have a pint?

25:05.171 --> 25:06.797
- What?
- Here.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.258
- What's that?
- It's money.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.760
Where'd you get it?

25:10.843 --> 25:14.847
From the fairies.
Go and have a drink, Paddy.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.934
I don't need a drink!
All I need is to be obeyed in me own house!

26:43.060 --> 26:44.062
Mother.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.041
Sweet Jesus.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.964
Jesus suffering Christ.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.179
He's a Brown!

27:18.262 --> 27:20.431
He's a Brown, all right!

27:20.514 --> 27:23.392
Christy's a Brown!

27:23.476 --> 27:25.227
Out!

27:25.311 --> 27:26.771
Where you goin', Paddy?

27:26.854 --> 27:30.816
Where do you think?
This man deserves a jar!

27:43.120 --> 27:44.997
This is Christy Brown!

27:45.956 --> 27:48.668
My son. Genius.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.386
Hello.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.846
Is he okay?

28:00.930 --> 28:03.891
- He's grand.
- Good.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.060
It's just that he can be a bit...

28:07.770 --> 28:08.938
What?

28:10.815 --> 28:12.483
A bit like Christy.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.572
He's fine. He's asleep now.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.533
Well...

28:21.617 --> 28:23.327
I'll leave you alone, then.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.051
14...

28:38.634 --> 28:41.762
15, 16...

28:41.946 --> 28:45.933
- Keep your voice down.
- 17. Great.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.694
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

28:57.278 --> 29:00.614
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

29:00.698 --> 29:05.411
<i>Happy birthday, dear Christy</i>

29:05.494 --> 29:10.082
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

29:12.710 --> 29:13.961
Go on, go on.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.756
- Go on now, me boy.
- He's a man now, Father.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.215
Come on, Christy. 17 candles.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.717
Now take a deep breath. Come on.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.180
Will you shut that baby up,
for Christ's sake?

29:24.263 --> 29:28.017
- Take it easy, Christy.
- Go on. Make a wish.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.061
- Come on, Christy.
- Go on, Christy.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.901
Go on, Christy!

29:39.612 --> 29:41.030
Go on, Christy.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.823
Go on!

29:42.907 --> 29:46.202
It's like the bleedin' fire of Hell,
that one is.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.204
Here you go, Christy, here.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.499
There, now. Go.

29:51.582 --> 29:54.376
That's it. Well done.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.213
Don't worry, you'll get your wheelchair, Christy.

29:58.696 --> 30:01.258
Get it! Go!

30:01.342 --> 30:03.677
Get the fuckin' ball!

30:09.934 --> 30:12.186
Save it, Christy!

30:12.269 --> 30:13.896
Well saved, Christy!

30:13.979 --> 30:15.147
Good save!

30:18.191 --> 30:19.235
He bit me!

30:21.821 --> 30:24.198
He bit me!

30:24.281 --> 30:27.576
It's a free out! A free out!

30:27.660 --> 30:30.079
- We're taking it.
- Okay, come on.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.998
Pass it, will ya?

30:33.082 --> 30:35.209
Stay away from them sheets!

30:39.046 --> 30:40.381
He handled it!

30:40.464 --> 30:43.175
Penalty right here. Give us it.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.927
Let Christy take it.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.485
You can't hold him up.

31:01.569 --> 31:02.903
Right!

31:21.505 --> 31:23.924
He's got a left like a cannon!

31:45.863 --> 31:48.240
If it stops at Tom, I'll kill you.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.248
Nobody...

31:56.332 --> 31:58.000
No, nobody.

31:58.083 --> 32:01.712
It's pointin' at Christy.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.589
He's not in the game.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.466
He is if it's pointing at him.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.220
I don't think it's pointing at me.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.365
You're the nicest of the lot.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.868
And you've nice eyes, too.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.249
Come on, let's go.

32:39.933 --> 32:41.877
Christy, you boy, you.
Chasin' the women.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.088
See you, Tom.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.547
See you, Rachel.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.091
See you, Tom.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.288
Not here, Brendan. Later.

33:34.054 --> 33:37.016
This is a fine time of night
to be coming in.

33:37.099 --> 33:40.728
- What's wrong, Ma?
- I don't like these late nights, Sheila.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.059
What's this?

35:04.186 --> 35:06.063
Holiday pay, isn't it?

35:08.941 --> 35:11.485
I got laid off.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.071
What about Christy's wheelchair?

35:15.989 --> 35:18.158
Christy will get his wheelchair, okay?

35:20.953 --> 35:23.413
Why did you get laid off?

35:25.499 --> 35:28.335
Don't you question me
in front of the children.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.008
A brick hit the foreman in the head
accidentally on purpose.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.437
It's Rachel.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.068
- How are ya?
- What?

36:00.659 --> 36:04.663
"Your beautiful eyes are splendid pools of blue...

36:04.746 --> 36:06.498
"in whose depths I swim regularly."

36:06.582 --> 36:07.791
It's lovely, isn't it?

36:07.875 --> 36:10.586
He even signed it himself.

36:20.512 --> 36:24.057
Even signed it himself. "C.B."

36:24.141 --> 36:27.561
That's not Tom Brown. That's Christy.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.439
Surely he does it with his left foot!

36:31.440 --> 36:35.903
You're in love with a cripple!
She's in love with a cripple!

36:36.987 --> 36:39.072
Rachel, come back!

36:45.078 --> 36:47.331
Anyone not abed?!

36:47.414 --> 36:50.209
Can I speak to Christy Brown, please?

36:52.419 --> 36:54.755
Christy! You're wanted.

37:07.601 --> 37:09.937
Did you paint that?

37:10.020 --> 37:11.438
Yeah.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.399
I can't take it.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.403
Sorry.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.039
Tell your brother Tom
we were asking for him.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.270
What's this?

37:51.353 --> 37:53.063
What does it look like?

37:55.691 --> 37:57.693
But we had porridge for breakfast.

38:00.237 --> 38:01.822
So?

38:03.532 --> 38:05.575
And we had it for dinner.

38:08.537 --> 38:09.746
So?

38:19.673 --> 38:21.258
I'm not eating any more.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.305
You get that into you.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.891
I can't.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.605
Get it into you.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.124
Go on, more.

38:55.631 --> 38:58.211
Who's been eating my porridge?

39:00.672 --> 39:01.882
What did you say?

39:05.594 --> 39:07.637
What did he say, missus?

39:07.721 --> 39:09.890
He just said the porridge is lovely.

39:14.574 --> 39:16.521
Burst his brain, the barbarian.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.777
Keep quiet!

40:02.067 --> 40:04.861
Come on, Christy.
Everybody has to go to bed.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.948
I have to do my painting.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.033
I know you have to do your painting

40:10.117 --> 40:12.828
but everybody has to go to bed
because there's no coal.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.872
Don't push me nerves any further, all right?

40:17.290 --> 40:19.793
I'm sorry.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.882
Christy, someday you'll have
a place of your own.

40:29.803 --> 40:32.305
All right, come on, you lot.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.307
Mind my paintings.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.161
Are all those kids in bed?

41:20.228 --> 41:21.688
What's up, Christy?

41:21.771 --> 41:23.899
Coal.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.902
- What?
- Coal!

41:27.385 --> 41:28.437
Coal?

41:30.363 --> 41:32.282
It's too early.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.326
Coal!

41:34.909 --> 41:36.453
All right, all right!

41:42.375 --> 41:45.462
Mister! Mister!

41:45.545 --> 41:49.257
Me driver abandoned me.
Can you push me?

41:51.259 --> 41:53.887
Come back, you bastard!

42:09.069 --> 42:11.112
Your plan's not working, Christy.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.864
Wait till he goes up the hill.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.841
Hold the baby.

42:40.642 --> 42:41.853
Come on, Christy!

42:46.356 --> 42:49.067
We'll be warm for the whole winter, Christy!

42:56.866 --> 43:00.161
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
What's happened to you?

43:00.245 --> 43:03.373
It's all right, Ma. It's only coal.

43:03.456 --> 43:06.084
I know where you got that coal.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.962
You know it's a sin to steal.

43:09.045 --> 43:12.215
And you know that God is looking down
on you right now.

43:12.299 --> 43:16.261
And that coal is not coming into this house.

43:22.267 --> 43:24.728
Come in here and sit by the fire, woman.

43:34.154 --> 43:35.655
You want me to wash you, Christy?

43:35.739 --> 43:37.907
No.

43:40.243 --> 43:43.371
- Good night, Christy.
- Don't you be late!

43:56.718 --> 43:59.971
Ma! There's something wrong with Christy!

44:00.055 --> 44:01.973
There's something wrong with him.

44:02.057 --> 44:05.435
What's wrong with you, Christy?
What's wrong?

44:07.562 --> 44:09.689
Fire!

44:11.441 --> 44:12.942
Fire!

44:13.985 --> 44:15.862
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

44:22.994 --> 44:24.454
Ma, what are you trying to do?

44:24.537 --> 44:25.622
Get water, quick!

44:26.539 --> 44:27.999
Hurry up!

44:30.001 --> 44:32.128
What's wrong with you? Are you mad?

45:01.408 --> 45:04.536
What have you got in the box, woman?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.996
Christy's money.

45:08.331 --> 45:11.543
- What?
- Money for Christy's wheelchair.

45:20.301 --> 45:24.264
Must be twenty pounds in there.

45:24.347 --> 45:27.058
28 pounds, 7 and threepence.

45:29.394 --> 45:34.315
We've been sitting here in the freezing cold,
eating porridge for breakfast, dinner, and tea,

45:34.399 --> 45:37.861
and you have 28 pounds, 7 and threepence
up the fucking chimney.

45:59.716 --> 46:01.593
Tom, Brian.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.595
Everybody, upstairs.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.889
Now!

46:12.353 --> 46:15.565
- Ma, what's wrong?
- You, too, Christy.

46:34.876 --> 46:36.878
Your daughter's getting married.

46:46.346 --> 46:48.473
Well, that's wonderful news.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.645
- When?
- Friday.

46:55.939 --> 46:57.398
What's the rush?

47:00.527 --> 47:02.362
She's pregnant.

47:02.445 --> 47:03.905
That's great news.

47:05.281 --> 47:11.162
I mean, that's wonderful.
That's just what we need.

47:12.872 --> 47:15.333
Who's the father? Or do you know?

47:15.416 --> 47:18.336
Leave me alone.

47:18.419 --> 47:19.546
It's not my fault.

47:19.629 --> 47:22.048
Then whose fault is it, then?
Is it mine?!

47:22.131 --> 47:26.678
Oh, that's a lovely picture.
The old woman that lives in the shoe

47:26.761 --> 47:28.888
and the daughter that couldn't keep
her knickers on!

47:28.972 --> 47:31.933
Stop it. Stop it!

47:32.016 --> 47:36.813
- You dirty, sleazy bitch!
- Stop it, Father!

47:40.191 --> 47:43.695
- Get out of here, Sheila.
- She should be thrown out!

47:43.778 --> 47:45.989
Her and her swollen belly! Fornication!

47:46.072 --> 47:47.448
Get away from me!

47:48.616 --> 47:50.785
That'll keep your legs shut for you!

47:50.869 --> 47:52.745
Paddy, leave her!

47:52.829 --> 47:55.123
When I get hold of you...

47:55.206 --> 47:58.626
I'll break every bone
in your fucking body!

48:00.003 --> 48:03.089
- Fucking kill him.
- Christy, stop.

48:03.172 --> 48:06.217
Jesus Christ!
What am I gonna do in this fucking house?

48:06.301 --> 48:07.887
Tom, Benny, stop him.

48:08.970 --> 48:12.140
Stop, Christy! Stop him!

48:12.223 --> 48:13.558
Christy, stop!

48:13.641 --> 48:15.768
Christy, please stop!

48:15.852 --> 48:18.980
Christy, stop! Christy, please stop!

48:21.900 --> 48:25.820
Christy, please! Christy, stop!
Stop it, Christy! Come on!

48:28.239 --> 48:30.199
Christy, stop.

48:36.748 --> 48:40.126
Christy. It's all right, Christy.

48:40.209 --> 48:42.295
He's gone now, Christy.

48:44.547 --> 48:46.174
Christy, come on.

48:46.257 --> 48:49.719
Christy, it's all right.

48:52.388 --> 48:55.391
Christy, I'm going away.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.730
I'll miss you, too.

49:05.068 --> 49:07.320
Look after me Ma for me.

49:38.184 --> 49:39.894
I need a light.

49:40.645 --> 49:41.646
What?

49:41.729 --> 49:43.272
I need a light.

49:43.356 --> 49:45.608
I don't smoke.

49:45.692 --> 49:47.235
I need a light!

49:47.318 --> 49:50.405
I'm not deaf. I can hear you.

49:50.488 --> 49:53.658
You need a light.
I haven't got any matches,

49:53.741 --> 49:57.286
so you'll have to wait here
while I go and get one.

50:03.001 --> 50:06.713
Don't you think I'm your mother
just because I'm looking after you for the evening.

50:06.796 --> 50:09.966
I don't need a fucking psychology lesson.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.968
I just need a fucking light.

50:27.734 --> 50:29.068
Light.

50:29.152 --> 50:31.529
Have you got a cigarette?

50:31.612 --> 50:34.574
I'm just after telling you I don't smoke.

50:35.742 --> 50:37.702
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

50:54.093 --> 50:55.344
Glass.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.308
No point in drinking out of the bottle.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.458
Hello. Dr Cole, please.

51:27.168 --> 51:28.711
Hello, Eileen.

51:30.004 --> 51:32.423
Yes. Yeah.

51:32.507 --> 51:34.509
Athetoid cerebral palsy.

51:36.344 --> 51:38.930
- He's 19?
- Yes, 19.

51:40.056 --> 51:42.058
Yes, 19.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.935
Yes. That's correct.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.814
I'll get his address.

51:48.898 --> 51:50.441
Okay. Okay.

51:53.486 --> 52:00.284
Dr Cole thinks that this model
would be the best for your son.

52:00.368 --> 52:03.496
- Which one?
- This one.

52:05.331 --> 52:06.833
That is grand.

52:08.251 --> 52:09.418
Yeah.

52:09.502 --> 52:12.255
See, that there, he won a prize for that.

52:12.338 --> 52:16.843
- That's lovely.
- His best one's here. Wait till I show you now.

52:16.926 --> 52:20.763
- What's that?
- Nothing. See that one? Isn't that lovely?

52:20.847 --> 52:24.308
And that one- torn, but you get the idea.

52:24.392 --> 52:27.937
That's his first one
he ever did there. See?

52:31.440 --> 52:34.068
- Watch your step there.
- I'm fine.

52:35.153 --> 52:38.364
Christy, there's someone to see you.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.953
This is Dr Cole.

52:47.874 --> 52:49.125
Hello, Christy.

52:52.211 --> 52:55.006
You're a great painter.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.299
No.

52:59.760 --> 53:05.600
Look, I'm a doctor, like your mother says,
and I specialise in cerebral palsy.

53:05.683 --> 53:10.980
We've just started a clinic- here in Dublin
and I wonder, would you like to attend it?

53:16.611 --> 53:19.280
No, we don't have to pay, Christy.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.077
Well?

53:26.287 --> 53:30.499
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.545
- He said, "Hope deferred..."
- "Maketh the heart sick."

53:36.797 --> 53:39.258
I understood that.

53:42.178 --> 53:43.247
Come on.

53:44.430 --> 53:46.766
Maybe.

53:47.975 --> 53:49.852
Good.

53:55.608 --> 53:59.070
- Come on in!
- Please!

53:59.153 --> 54:02.865
- No!
- You have to.

54:02.949 --> 54:05.117
What do you want them to do,
tow you behind?

54:05.201 --> 54:07.954
Do you want to ride up front
with the driver?

54:08.037 --> 54:10.539
Come on, Christy.
Come up in the front with me.

54:10.623 --> 54:12.500
I'm all right.

54:12.583 --> 54:13.960
He said he's all right.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.063
Eileen.

55:18.357 --> 55:20.901
Eileen, come here.

55:24.071 --> 55:26.240
Easy. Come on. Relax.

55:26.324 --> 55:29.535
- What?
- I want to go home.

55:29.618 --> 55:31.996
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

55:35.583 --> 55:39.253
The door's been locked
for a few days now.

55:39.337 --> 55:41.964
I've got to try.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.220
Christy.

55:48.304 --> 55:50.473
Go away.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.977
Christy, there's somebody here to see you.

56:02.401 --> 56:03.861
Christy?

56:07.406 --> 56:09.909
I'm not a child.

56:09.992 --> 56:11.702
Not a child, he says.

56:11.786 --> 56:13.788
There's too many children at the clinic.

56:17.833 --> 56:21.087
Christy, if you like,
we can work here.

56:22.088 --> 56:23.589
Fuck off.

56:26.092 --> 56:31.389
With speech therapy, I could teach you
how to say "fuck off" more clearly.

56:55.329 --> 56:57.832
One, two...

56:57.915 --> 57:00.584
three, four, five.

57:00.668 --> 57:02.586
And over again.

57:02.670 --> 57:04.922
One, two...

57:05.005 --> 57:06.966
Just relax with it. Relax.

57:07.049 --> 57:10.678
Three, four, five. That's it.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.890
One, two, three, and out.

57:20.271 --> 57:21.981
Breathe.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.527
Nope. Your lungs are too weak.
Leave it be.

57:26.610 --> 57:29.613
That's right. Try this instead.

57:33.492 --> 57:35.828
Right. Now you have a go.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.830
Yes. Blow.

57:40.666 --> 57:42.126
Steady, steady.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.211
And one big breath.

57:46.005 --> 57:49.383
That's very good.

57:49.467 --> 57:51.469
Now focus the breath.

57:55.306 --> 57:57.808
Breathe slowly and...

57:57.892 --> 57:59.894
He's been like that for three days now.

57:59.977 --> 58:03.105
I don't know what's wrong.
He won't talk to me.

58:03.189 --> 58:06.525
Go on up and see him.

58:14.742 --> 58:17.244
I've brought you a present.

58:22.291 --> 58:23.751
Thanks.

58:27.171 --> 58:29.924
There's a speech in there
I'd love you to have a look at.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.718
It's "To be or not to be." Hamlet.

58:35.596 --> 58:38.307
I wish you'd stop feeling sorry for yourself.

58:41.477 --> 58:43.896
I don't want to be a failure, either.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.859
Will you have a look at it for me?

58:51.529 --> 58:52.821
Maybe.

59:15.719 --> 59:22.935
"To be... or not... to be.

59:25.604 --> 59:30.526
"To be... or not to be.

59:31.610 --> 59:35.239
"That is the question.

59:35.322 --> 59:39.034
"To be or not...

59:39.118 --> 59:40.828
"To be...

59:40.911 --> 59:44.999
"That is the question...

59:45.082 --> 59:48.043
"Whether...

59:48.127 --> 59:52.214
"nobler in the mind to..."

59:52.298 --> 59:56.719
"To be... or not to be."

59:56.802 --> 01:00:01.515
"To be or not to be...

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.768
"That is the question.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:09.565
"Whether it is nobler in the mind..."

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:12.610
to have to fucking suffer listening to that.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.781
He's in love with this girl Eileen.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:25.998
Well... so long as he's getting better.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.709
He could get hurt, Paddy.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.797
A broken body's nothing to a broken heart.

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:51.324
Yeah!

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.401
Eileen, how's it going?

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:56.111
Very, very well.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.948
I've got some news for you.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:01.241
What?

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.911
Remember I told you
about Peter and his gallery?

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.412
Yeah.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:10.793
Well, he's offered you
an exhibition of your own.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.379
What do you think about that?

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.093
I think you're brilliant.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.013
Yeah. I'm only as brilliant as my patients.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:29.812
"Consummation...

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:32.439
"devoutly to be wished.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.566
"To die, to sleep..."

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.695
"To sleep...

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:40.030
"perchance to dream.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:42.533
"Aye, there's the rub.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.703
"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come."

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.538
Is that our Christy up there?

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.250
Does that sound like our Christy?

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.420
Sounds a lot better.

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:58.757
Not to me, it doesn't.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:01.677
Are you mad, woman?

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.471
You can understand your child
for the first time.

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:06.724
I always understood him.

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:08.559
Nobody else ever did.

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:12.896
At least he can function now.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:16.483
There's something in that voice that...

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.527
that disturbs me.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.530
What do you mean?

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.743
Too much hope in it.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.328
What?

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.415
There's too much hope in it.

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.881
"Fly to others that we know not of?

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:43.552
"Thus, conscience does make cowards of us all."

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:44.845
What was it?

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:48.182
- "And thus, the native hue..."
- "And thus, the native hue of resolution

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.977
"is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.730
"and enterprises of great pitch and moment

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:59.151
"with this regard, their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action."

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.946
What do you think about Hamlet, Christy?

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.575
A cripple. He can't act.

01:03:08.035 --> 01:03:09.328
He did in the end.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.913
Too late.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.462
Eileen...

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.466
I like you very much.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:25.093
And I like you, Christy.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.263
You have the heart of a poet.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:30.808
No.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.643
Oh, well.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:35.896
What?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.443
Nothing.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:48.742
I better go.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:59.336
Ladies and gentlemen?

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.340
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:07.219
It gives me great pleasure
to open this exhibition...

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.721
of the work of Christy Brown.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:13.517
A lot of people say that Christy
is a great crippled painter.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.354
I think that's an insult to Christy.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.605
That's right!

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.818
Christy is simply a great painter, full stop.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.697
He has struggled with his material...

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.325
as every painter must do,
to bring it under control.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.289
If you look around the walls today

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:38.083
you'll see the forces that shape Christy Brown.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.004
His mother...

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:44.172
his father...

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.091
his brothers and sisters...

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.052
and the lady who brought him
to public recognition,

01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:50.345
Dr Eileen Cole.

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:51.638
Yes!

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.613
So, what do you think?

01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:10.949
There are only two kinds of painting-

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:13.410
religious and the circus.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:18.206
Give me some wine.

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:24.922
You know, on each side of the nose.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:40.228
That's what it says here- "Seven-day Seascape".
Something like that.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.612
There you go.

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:52.532
And you've had enough to drink.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:55.327
Don't have any more drink.
Do you hear me?

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.704
I'm going for a meal, Ma. You coming?

01:05:57.788 --> 01:05:59.498
No, no, no. I'm...

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.042
I'll take your father home.
He's not feeling well.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.004
There's no pints, you mean.
It's good wine, tell him.

01:06:06.088 --> 01:06:10.550
Your father never drank anything
but pints in his life. I'll take him home.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.052
You getting a taxi?

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.888
- Eileen's giving us a lift.
- Right.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:19.101
- I'll see you later, Ma.
- I'll see you later.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:24.523
I think Mulcahy is a great painter.

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:27.359
In the... soul.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.737
You see? I agree with Christy.

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:33.865
He's too uncontrolled for me.

01:06:36.118 --> 01:06:39.830
Tim. Let Christy try the wine.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:53.010
<i>Introibo ad altare Dei.</i>

01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:55.679
- What's he saying?
- The Latin mass.

01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:00.308
I thought that was James Joyce.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:01.727
The wine's A1.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.148
- Can you tell us what year it is, Christy?
- I'm not that sophisticated.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.816
Not yet.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.714
I love you, Eileen.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.674
And I love you, Christy.

01:07:32.758 --> 01:07:36.595
No. I really love you.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.520
I love you all.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.898
That's good.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:51.359
I even love... Peter.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:02.412
I'm glad you like Peter, Christy,
because we're going to get married in six months.

01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:04.372
Christy, what do you think of that?

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.767
Con...

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.232
Con...

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:48.667
Congratulations...

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.545
Peter and Eileen...

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.756
on the won...

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:59.386
wonderful news.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:13.191
I'm glad you taught me how to speak...

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.528
so I could say that, Eileen.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:29.749
Well... Where were we, then?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.294
- Discussing Mulcahy.
- Mulcahy's empty.

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.045
I thought you said Mulcahy was full of soul.

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:37.131
I said he was empty. Whiskey!

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.386
Take it easy, Christy.

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:49.603
You're not my mother.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.772
Never forget that.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:15.503
You know, I know what age that is.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.382
That's ten-year-old...

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.012
same age as me.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.889
- Don't give him any more.
- Pour!

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.474
Take that whiskey from him, Tony.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.894
Touch it, and I'll kick you...

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:38.360
in the only part of your anatomy
that's animated.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:41.071
Stop it.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.999
Why did you say you loved me?

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:54.626
Because I do love you.

01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:57.754
You mean platonic love.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:04.803
I've had nothing but platonic love all me life.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:07.138
Do you know what I say?

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:09.307
Fuck Plato!

01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:15.480
And fuck all love
that's not 100% commitment!

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.239
Pour!

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:31.371
- I can't let you go any further.
- Let's discuss nature.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:34.165
Keep quiet, Christy.

01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:37.627
What are you going to do about it, Peter?

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:41.798
You're a nice man.
What are you going to do about it?

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:44.759
Peter, sit down.

01:11:44.843 --> 01:11:47.262
- I'm going to wheel you out of this restaurant.
- Yeah?

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.392
Stop it!

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:56.896
- Wheel out the cripple! Wheel out the cripple!
- Stop! Just stop it.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.150
- Where's the fucking brake on this thing?
- Stop it!

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:04.404
Stop it! Stop it, you bastard!

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:05.989
Stop it!

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.757
Sharon!

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.719
Sharon, come in for your tea.
Come on in for your tea, will you?

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.807
Come in now for your tea, please. Come on.

01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:35.894
All right, Ma.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.495
- Get up, Christy.
- I'm not well.

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.497
You've got a hangover, that's all.

01:14:19.581 --> 01:14:21.332
Leave me alone.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.508
You get more like your father every day.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.804
All hard on the outside
and putty on the inside.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:38.850
It's in here...

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.269
battles are won.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.688
Not in the pub...

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.941
pretending to be a big fella
in front of the lads.

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.949
Right. If you've given up, I haven't.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.676
What do you think you're doing, Mum?

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:57.512
Building a room for you.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:15:59.764
Don't be mad.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.934
Maybe if you have a room of your own...

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:05.478
you might start painting again.

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:16.823
You have me heartbroken, Christy Brown.

01:16:19.516 --> 01:16:22.161
Sometimes, I think you are me heart.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:27.041
If I could give you my legs,
I would gladly take yours.

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:34.215
What's wrong with you, Christy?

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.596
I'm sorry, Mum.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:59.073
What in the name of God is going on here?

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:02.118
Christy and me's building a room.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.454
- Youse are you building a room?
- Yep.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.543
Will you have a look at this?

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.007
Christy, you may be a great painter

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:17.675
but you'll never be a brickie.

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:20.178
Fair play to you, missus.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.097
Right, lads.

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:25.016
You bring in some more bricks.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:28.019
Mix up a bit of muck.
Bring me in me level, will you?

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.356
Brown and Son Contractors are on the job.

01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:36.027
Here. You start over there.
I'll start over here

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.528
and by the time you have
three courses up there

01:17:37.612 --> 01:17:39.614
I'll be finished here
and inside having me tea.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.282
Not at all.

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:45.662
Water. More water.

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:48.790
I'm not beaten yet, bejesus.

01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:53.086
My dad.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:56.589
Brian, boys. Listen to me.
Let your father win.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.132
- What?
- He needs it.

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:00.452
Here.

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:02.637
Take it easy, Father, will you?

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.090
Take it easy?

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:12.313
I was never able to take it easy
and you of all people ought to know that.

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:13.448
Right, lads?

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:18.695
That's her finished.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:23.950
They've a long way to go
to be a better man than their father.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.538
Yeah.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.922
Well, Christy, that's the nearest
he'll ever come

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:39.632
to saying he loves you.

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.636
How are you?

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.057
Did you see the face on them?

01:18:48.141 --> 01:18:50.226
To see you pushing that cart.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.812
I'm parched now.
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.230
I'm going to make a nice cup of tea.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.232
I'm going to have the cake here.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:57.942
Oh, Christy.

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:03.072
- I'll just put the kettle on.
- All right, Ma.

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:09.996
Come on. Who's in there?
These kids.

01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:11.998
What's happening?

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.000
Come on, let me in.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.919
What's going on?

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:20.131
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Christy!
- What?

01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:22.842
Your father's on the floor
and I can't open the door.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:25.261
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Paddy!

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.346
Christy, I can't open the door.

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:36.272
Get out of the way.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.191
Christy, you can't open the door.

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:40.443
Oh, Jesus. it doesn't open.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.528
Christy, push!

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:51.730
Jesus.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.165
Paddy?

01:19:54.207 --> 01:19:56.125
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Paddy.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:06.302
Seven pounds, five shillings
and sixpence he owed, missus.

01:20:12.892 --> 01:20:15.895
<i>I was the best of them all</i>

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.483
<i>I was the best of them all</i>

01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:24.153
Fair play to you, Christy.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:26.697
Drinks for everyone.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.700
- Take it easy.
- That's my painting money.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:33.204
I'm trying to get some drinks.
Get her a cider. Shut the old bitch up.

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:35.832
Fair play to you, Christy.
Your old fella will never be dead.

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:37.500
How's me Ma going to survive?

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:42.046
Don't be worrying about them.
They'll be all right.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:48.344
Terry, will you tell us about
when you and the old fella

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.681
carried the fireman up the ladder?
What happened there?

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.433
- Later.
- Yeah.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:01.899
Give us a song, somebody.

01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:04.610
Give us a song. Tom, give us a song.

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:06.279
Christy.

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:09.949
- Sing Daddy's favourite.
- Yeah.

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.455
<i>As down the glen</i>

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:19.542
<i>One Easter morn</i>

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.962
<i>To a city fair</i>

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.047
<i>Rode I</i>

01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:27.884
<i>There, armed lines</i>

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:30.636
<i>Of marching men</i>

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.471
<i>In squadrons...</i>

01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:34.640
Will somebody shut him up?

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:38.144
<i>No fife did hum</i>

01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:40.980
<i>Nor battle drum</i>

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:45.818
<i>Did sound its dread tattoo</i>

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.905
<i>And the Angelus bell...</i>

01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:52.450
Hey. Keep it down a bit there, lads.

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:55.244
<i>...rang out in the foggy dew</i>

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.831
He was singing that for his father.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.291
His father was nothing but a mouth...

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:02.251
<i>High over Dublin</i>

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:04.670
like all the Browns.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.177
All right, lads... take it easy.

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:13.763
Respect for Da.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:25.983
I don't fight cripples.

01:22:27.593 --> 01:22:28.696
Hold on.

01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:35.201
Wreck the pub!

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:48.881
Somebody get the till!
Get the till! Get the money!

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.217
Get the till!

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:00.726
Drinks are on the house!

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.908
That's great, Christy.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.577
No, it's not.

01:23:18.703 --> 01:23:20.746
Why not?

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:23.916
He's not there. I've no eye.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.043
What?

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.586
I'm not a painter.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:31.549
I think it's brilliant.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.676
It's the image of Da.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.685
Poor Tom, what?

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.186
Yeah.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.231
"All is nothing.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:50.359
"Therefore nothing must end."

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:54.530
- What's all this, Christy?
- Nothing.

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:56.449
Sorry I asked.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:06.083
Benny, would you help us?

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.960
Doing what?

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.795
Writing.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.590
Yeah. Writing what?

01:24:13.591 --> 01:24:15.134
Me own story.

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:19.764
Yeah. Course I will.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:23.809
No.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.979
Don't worry, Christy.
The book is great.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:29.982
It's not bad.

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:33.152
Do you know what I was going to call it?

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.612
What?

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.822
The Reminiscences...

01:24:38.449 --> 01:24:40.159
Reminiscences?

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.662
Of A Mental Defective.

01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:47.291
That's a terrible title.

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.919
It was my blue period.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.674
And you typed all of it
with your left foot?

01:24:56.801 --> 01:24:59.178
I didn't do it with me nose.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.432
I really wanted to finish it.

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:05.851
You'll hear it later.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:09.146
I have an appointment. I told you.

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:12.024
Is he good-looking?

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.652
- Who?
- Your appointment.

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:19.156
Yeah, in his own way he's nice.

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:26.372
It doesn't matter to me.
You can meet who you like.

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:29.667
- Is he now?
- What?

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.502
Is he good-looking?

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:36.215
Yeah.

01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:42.888
Are you in love with him?

01:25:50.688 --> 01:25:53.357
You're very bloody nosy, Christy Brown.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.652
I was only asking.

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.075
Would you like a drink?

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:04.869
I'm working. I can't.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.579
Later.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.671
I have a date, I told you.

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.590
Yeah. I forgot.

01:26:23.429 --> 01:26:26.724
- You're a fast worker, aren't you?
- Read your book.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:43.532
I can't with you staring at me.

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:45.534
So I'll look away.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.706
Oh, God.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:05.304
- She's very pretty, isn't she?
- Prettier than that bloody picture.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.731
Just a minute.

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:18.150
Ma, are you in?

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:20.778
All right. Go ahead.

01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:35.417
Jesus! £800, Christy.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.004
Are you finished?

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:40.965
That was scrumptious, Ma.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:43.300
Like you.

01:27:43.342 --> 01:27:46.845
I fancy something sweet now.
What have you for dessert?

01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.764
Ma, what have you for dessert?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.099
Dessert?

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:55.104
Kids, do you not fancy
of drop of ice cream now?

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:58.857
- Ice cream, Ma.
- Get some ice cream.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:04.029
Some raspberry ripple.
No, some Neapolitan.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:08.951
- All right!
- The pink and green stuff.

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:11.036
But just this once, mind you now.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:14.164
Won't see me spending money
on an ice cream.

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:26.468
Jesus, what's this?

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.559
Here now, Ma!

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.061
What's this?

01:28:36.145 --> 01:28:37.563
It's Christy's money, Ma!

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:39.523
- Count it!
- Bring it here!

01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:42.901
£800.

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:49.325
That's more money than your poor father
ever earned in a whole year.

01:28:51.577 --> 01:28:54.538
I can't take it.

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.250
It's for you. It's yours.

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:02.379
I can't take it, son.

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:05.507
Da was a bricklayer, Ma...

01:29:05.591 --> 01:29:07.718
and I'm a writer.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.887
I know it's mad money.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.724
I want you to have it.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.228
What would I do with it?

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:26.403
To start, get yourself a dress
and a new pair of shoes.

01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:28.947
Will you?

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:42.294
Christy? You have a visitor.

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:52.054
- You look well.
- So do you.

01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:55.057
Thank you.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.059
Sit down.

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:05.609
Look, I won't stay very long.

01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:08.112
Stay as long as you like.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:12.491
I need to ask you a favour.

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.451
What?

01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:16.954
A benefit.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:20.165
Where?

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.000
Lord Castlewelland's.

01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:25.003
Him? He's mad.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.800
Posh.

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:32.010
Filthy rich.

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:38.851
I know you don't like appearing in public
but it's for a good cause.

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:42.855
- For the cripples.
- For the cripples.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.982
Yeah.

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:47.484
I'll try to behave myself.

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:50.946
Sure it won't upset you too much?

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:53.782
So I'll anaesthetise myself.

01:30:53.866 --> 01:30:56.660
No! Not too much.

01:30:59.663 --> 01:31:01.373
How's Peter?

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.622
We have to get going, Christy.

01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:43.123
Yeah.

01:31:47.753 --> 01:31:51.632
What do you think?
Too much self-pity?

01:31:51.757 --> 01:31:56.595
No. I think he's a lovely man
and not in the least sentimental.

01:31:57.429 --> 01:31:59.765
Mary, do you really think so?

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.308
Yep.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.103
And would you go out with him?

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:06.271
Certainly.

01:32:06.355 --> 01:32:08.607
Now listen, everyone...

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.859
So you'd go out with me?

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:15.113
I might. He's talking about you.

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:19.284
I want to introduce you to one of the brave...

01:32:19.326 --> 01:32:22.204
Well, no, quite the bravest chap
I've ever come across.

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:27.292
Yes, well, when Christy Brown was born,

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:31.046
the doctors told his mother
that it was just no good...

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:35.968
- Stay with us for a couple of hours.
- a vegetable for the rest of his little life.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:40.681
But Bridget Brown, she wouldn't take that.
Oh, no. She knew...

01:32:40.806 --> 01:32:43.475
Would you go out with me tonight?

01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:47.521
I told you, Christy.
I have an appointment.

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:51.191
And so we have with us here tonight...

01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:53.193
Are you in love with him?

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:56.738
Her faith in him and...

01:32:56.822 --> 01:32:58.323
Well?

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.911
I asked you did you love him, Mary?

01:33:02.995 --> 01:33:07.249
Introduce to you Christy Brown,
a man of genius.

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:08.542
Mary?

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:10.252
Christy.

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:12.754
Mary, I asked you a question.

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:17.009
- Do you?
- That's none of your business.

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:21.013
- So you won't answer me?
- Why should I?

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:24.099
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:27.185
You imagine that people are afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you, okay?

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:29.688
You're afraid of yourself.

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:32.566
- Oh, come on. Look, just...
- You're afraid of me.

01:33:32.691 --> 01:33:34.568
I can't talk about this now. I'm going.

01:33:34.693 --> 01:33:37.195
Why can't we talk now?
Now's good enough for me.

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:41.199
- I'll see you again some time.
- "Again some time." I heard that before, Mary.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:43.535
Why is it always some fucking time?

01:33:43.619 --> 01:33:45.704
Mary, stay!

01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:49.875
Stay!

01:33:57.633 --> 01:33:59.384
Christy.

01:34:01.637 --> 01:34:03.555
We've got to go.

01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:14.900
Right. Take me out to the firing squad so.

01:34:54.773 --> 01:34:58.695
I must say I'm really honoured to be asked
to give voice to the words of Christy Brown.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:08.995
"I was born in the Rotunda Hospital,
on June the 5th, 1932.

01:35:09.121 --> 01:35:12.958
"There were 22 children in all,

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:16.962
"of which 13 survived.

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:23.385
<i>"It would not be true to say
that I am no longer lonely.</i>

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.221
<i>"I have made myself articulate and understood</i>

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:28.223
<i>"to people in many parts of the world</i>

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:31.643
<i>"and this is something we all wish to do,</i>

01:35:31.685 --> 01:35:33.645
<i>"whether we're crippled or not.</i>

01:35:34.688 --> 01:35:38.567
<i>"Yet, like everyone else,
I am acutely conscious sometimes</i>

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:40.819
<i>"of my own isolation,</i>

01:35:40.861 --> 01:35:43.405
"even in the midst of people.

01:35:44.197 --> 01:35:48.702
"And I often give up hope of ever being able
to really communicate with them."

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:53.039
- "It is not only the sort of isolation..."
- What's the matter with Christy?

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:56.209
"that every writer or artist
must experience in the creative mood

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:59.087
"if he is to create anything at all.

01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:03.675
"It is like a black cloud,
sweeping down on me unexpectedly,

01:36:03.759 --> 01:36:06.928
<i>"cutting me off from others.</i>

01:36:07.012 --> 01:36:09.514
<i>"A sort of deaf-muteness.</i>

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:16.354
"I lay back in my chair

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:21.568
"while my own left foot
beat time to a new rhythm.

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:26.615
"Now I could relax
and enjoy myself completely.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:30.368
"I was at peace. Happy."

01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:45.967
Thank you.

01:36:46.051 --> 01:36:48.386
Come on, Ma, stand up.

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:54.893
Ma! Mother, come here.

01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.896
Christy, no, don't.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.315
All right.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:06.404
These are for you.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.261
Give us one of them flowers, Ma.

01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:48.196
You're not coming with us in the car, Christy?

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.489
No.

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:51.700
You're mad, Christy. It's great.

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:55.662
Get in the car before I kick your arse.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:57.956
Good luck, Christy.

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:09.718
Good night, Christy.

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:11.219
Good night, Ma.

01:38:17.183 --> 01:38:19.978
Go on. I'm all right.

01:38:21.897 --> 01:38:25.692
Will you get in the car now, Ma? I'm fine.

01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:34.326
Night, Christy. Be careful.

01:38:34.409 --> 01:38:36.494
You're not me Da, Tom.

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:38.163
You take it easy, Christy.

01:38:38.204 --> 01:38:40.498
Take it easy yourself!

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.167
Let's go.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:48.381
Christy, tuck that under you.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:51.051
Great stuff.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:55.931
I hope to see you again.

01:38:56.014 --> 01:38:59.601
Yes. I hope to see you again, Christy.

01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:03.772
Before closing time.

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:47.899
- I thought I'd lost ya.
- Not at all.

01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:51.069
- You can just see Joyce's Tower down there.
- Oh, aye?

01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:56.950
And that's where JM Synge was born,
at the foot of the mountains.

01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:01.329
What'll we drink to?

01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:05.250
Let's drink to Dublin.

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.669
To Dublin? Why?

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:11.089
Because Christy Brown was born there.
