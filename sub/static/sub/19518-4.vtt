dead body out of this water

He grew up in foster care.

07:23.289 --> 07:25.106
He was taken out of a home
where he was sexually abused.

08:59.024 --> 09:00.647
Or maybe...

it's because he was

10:11.803 --> 10:13.409
We know he lost one at the scrap yard.

10:13.434 --> 10:14.917
He could have gone
looking for Danny at Jed's

10:14.942 --> 10:17.406

39:26.430 --> 39:28.710
He said you got her out of there.

39:30.623 --> 39:32.956
Why are you asking me this?

39:33.149 --> 39:35.326
I'm trying to understand...

39:35.361 --> 39:38.629
if he would've wanted
to hurt you, Maggie.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.625
He was very angry with you.

39:43.502 --> 39:46.020
He said you took away his daughter.

39:46.205 --> 39:48.099
You need to stop.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.481
I need this to be over!

39:50.810 --> 39:52.943
I need it to be over!

39:52.978 --> 39:54.950
I'm sorry.

39:55.278 --> 39:58.043
- Just go!
- I'll go.

39:58.068 --> 40:00.202
- Go!
- Sorry.

40:00.227 --> 40:01.826
(Crying)

40:04.735 --> 40:05.899
I'll tell you the same thing

40:05.935 --> 40:08.269
I told your cold bitch of a partner.

40:08.304 --> 40:09.945
You can ask until your eyes fall out.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.970
My answer won't change. I didn't do it.

40:12.074 --> 40:14.908
There's one part of this
whole thing I can't figure out.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.479
The earring testing
positive for pond water.

40:18.514 --> 40:20.844
I can smell a set up here.

40:21.164 --> 40:22.592
Someone's coming for me

40:22.617 --> 40:23.945
and they have thought
this thing through.

40:23.970 --> 40:25.202
I have enemies.

40:25.227 --> 40:28.125
Your prints were on the
earring. The eagle feather.

40:28.656 --> 40:30.086
You buried it.

40:30.111 --> 40:32.712
I found it after the kid was killed.

40:32.737 --> 40:34.721
I thought Jesse just left it there.

40:34.746 --> 40:36.391
Why bury it?

40:40.070 --> 40:43.055
'Cause I know they were
gonna bury the kid in a suit!

40:44.574 --> 40:46.805
That's not who Jesse was.

40:47.388 --> 40:50.047
Those earrings were Jesse.

40:51.724 --> 40:53.224
(Sighs)

41:02.290 --> 41:04.090
Make a list of anyone
who would have had access

41:04.125 --> 41:06.222
to that much of your product.

41:09.171 --> 41:11.138
Why don't you think I did it?

41:11.299 --> 41:13.643
Because you cared about him.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.002
People kill people they
care about all the time.

41:17.037 --> 41:19.002
To keep them.

41:20.736 --> 41:23.536
You knew Jesse and Danny's plan to run.

41:24.700 --> 41:26.832
You were gonna let them go.

41:32.052 --> 41:33.936
She was a good kid.

41:34.483 --> 41:36.944
Jesse referred to himself as she?

41:37.451 --> 41:39.522
She did at my house.

41:41.728 --> 41:43.116
Jesse: I'm a straight boy.

41:43.141 --> 41:44.490
I mean I was, that was me.

41:44.515 --> 41:46.014
That's what I would tell myself.

41:46.039 --> 41:48.272
You know as soon as I figured it out,

41:48.297 --> 41:50.244
like before I met you.
Before I even did anything,

41:50.269 --> 41:52.460
just thinking about it. I felt like...

41:52.485 --> 41:54.747
people could see it on me.

41:54.772 --> 41:56.974
Like did you know when you first saw me?

41:57.009 --> 41:59.045
Danny: Yeah, because
you were riding a bike.

41:59.070 --> 42:01.078
(Laughing)

42:01.113 --> 42:03.358
Not all transsexuals ride a
bike, but like most of us do.
