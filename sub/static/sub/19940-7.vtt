WEBVTT

00:06.020 --> 00:09.860
Mama? Esther's in a clean diaper
and Ethan is fed.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.570
I'll be home around 5:00.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.570
-(thumping)
-ABE: Oh, man.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.030
Mama?

00:15.070 --> 00:16.450
ROSE: Well, you're not
pulling hard enough.

00:16.490 --> 00:17.990
ABE: Half on the floor,
half on the carpet.

00:18.030 --> 00:20.410
-Lift, then, lift.
-What happened here?

00:20.450 --> 00:22.960
Oh. Well, Zelda must've moved
the beds together to clean

00:23.000 --> 00:24.330
and never pulled them apart.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.000
-I'll talk to her.
-It's not like her.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.290
It's definitely not like her.

00:27.340 --> 00:28.500
ABE:
Well, I'm off.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.300
His first big day at Bell Labs.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.760
Have fun, Papa.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.430
It's not about fun.
It's about the future.

00:33.470 --> 00:35.390
And I'm going to take
a shower, hmm.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.390
ABE: I'll be home the same time
tonight, Rose.

00:37.430 --> 00:41.350
ROSE:
Okay. Have a nice day.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.850
MIDGE: So, this morning,
I witnessed the aftermath

00:43.890 --> 00:45.810
of my parents' sex night.

00:45.850 --> 00:49.690
I caught them pulling
the twin beds back apart.

00:49.730 --> 00:51.360
And, you know,
I heard that scraping noise

00:51.400 --> 00:52.940
in the middle of the night
when I was a kid,

00:52.990 --> 00:54.740
and I was scared to death
that it was a ghost.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.820
So, thanks for the memories,
Mom and Dad.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.030
(laughter)

00:59.080 --> 01:00.910
I always thought it was a ghost,

01:00.950 --> 01:03.120
but now I know it was something
much scarier:

01:03.160 --> 01:04.750
my parents' sex life.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.460
-(laughter)
-Thanks a lot, Mom and Dad.

01:06.500 --> 01:11.550
But now I know it was something
much scarier than a ghost.

01:11.590 --> 01:14.420
-It was my parents' sex life.
-(laughter)

01:14.470 --> 01:16.720
No, for years, I'd-I'd
embarrass myself at Halloween

01:16.760 --> 01:18.050
because the other kids
would be making ghost noises

01:18.090 --> 01:21.060
like, "Ooh, ooh!"

01:21.100 --> 01:24.730
And I'd be going...
(moaning)

01:24.770 --> 01:28.060
(laughter)

01:28.100 --> 01:32.610
Mommy, why is
that man's pants lumpy?

01:32.650 --> 01:35.150
MIDGE: Question that really
needs to be asked is

01:35.200 --> 01:38.910
why is my son looking
at lumps in men's pants?

01:38.950 --> 01:40.830
A little boy is only
three and a half feet tall,

01:40.870 --> 01:42.700
so all the time he's waiting
for Mommy to answer,

01:42.740 --> 01:45.750
he's stuck there at lump level.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.920
Train stops, he's bumping up
against the thing.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.580
-(audience groans)
-Oh, a little boy

01:49.630 --> 01:51.340
bumping up against an erection
crossed a line?

01:51.380 --> 01:52.750
Okay.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.260
-It was a test. You passed.
-(laughter)

01:55.300 --> 01:57.050
Uncomfortable, right?

01:57.090 --> 01:59.090
But the good thing about kids is
that when they ask a question,

01:59.140 --> 02:00.890
they don't really listen
to the answer.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.850
So, when my son asks something
uncomfortable like,

02:02.890 --> 02:05.350
"Why doesn't Daddy
live here anymore?"

02:05.390 --> 02:09.100
I just say, "Yes. Howdy Doody
is a real boy."

02:09.150 --> 02:11.230
(laughter)

02:13.480 --> 02:16.030
Thank you. Please come again.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.990
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?

02:18.030 --> 02:21.030
Yes, I want something that'll
make my wife look like...

02:21.070 --> 02:22.910
...Elizabeth Taylor.

02:22.950 --> 02:25.120
So, I pointed him
to the sunglass department.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.830
(scattered laughter)

02:26.870 --> 02:28.420
...Elizabeth Taylor.

02:28.460 --> 02:31.210
And I wanted to say to him,
"Sir, look in a mirror.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.500
"Would someone who looks like
Elizabeth Taylor come home

02:33.550 --> 02:35.800
to someone who looks like you?"

02:35.840 --> 02:37.170
(laughter)

02:37.220 --> 02:38.720
...Elizabeth Taylor.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.430
I wanted to say to him,
"I hope she's out shopping

02:40.470 --> 02:43.010
for something that makes you
look like Rock Hudson."

02:43.050 --> 02:45.930
...Elizabeth Taylor.

02:45.970 --> 02:48.480
So, I asked for all the money
in his wallet and said,

02:48.520 --> 02:49.850
"There. Now at least
it'll feel like

02:49.900 --> 02:51.150
you're married
to Elizabeth Taylor."

02:51.190 --> 02:53.610
(laughter)

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.200 --> 03:03.870
You have a tight ten.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.580
I mean, you are a woman
with a tight ten.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.160
I'm getting cheesecake.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.370
People were peeing
their pants tonight.

03:08.410 --> 03:09.830
We're gonna need
to buy a new mop.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.830
Couldn't even hear myself
over the laughs.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.290
I timed you tonight.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.130
With laughs, it came
to just over 11 minutes.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.590
You have a tight 11.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.550
I'm a tenth of the way
to my second tight ten.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.590
Most comics take years to work
up those first ten minutes.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.680
You did it in months.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.800
Feels like years.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.010
You're really good.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.270
Ah, gee, thanks.

03:27.310 --> 03:29.180
No, Miriam, I mean...

03:29.230 --> 03:31.230
you're really good.

03:31.270 --> 03:34.440
Do not make me cry
at the Stage Deli.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.820
-I don't want you to fucking
cry. -You're starting to cry.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.360
-I'm not starting to cry.
-You are, too,

03:38.400 --> 03:40.200
starting to cry and
that's gonna make me cry.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.990
Shit, there's, like,
water on my face.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.490
Those are tears.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.200
What does this look like?
You got a mirror?

03:45.240 --> 03:47.740
You look kind of wet
and out of focus,

03:47.790 --> 03:49.410
like-like a Doris Day picture.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.500
Christ.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.750
Give me a napkin.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.040
People are looking.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.460
Stop looking at me!

03:57.500 --> 03:59.210
-Susie.
-Get back to your kippers!

03:59.260 --> 04:01.840
Let's just eat.
They'll stop looking.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.800
-WOMAN: Check, please.
-MAN: Check.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.720
So, you know
what this means, right?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.260
No, what's it mean?

04:07.310 --> 04:08.930
It's time to leave the nest.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.600
You mean tour? I can't tour.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.770
Mm, you're not ready to tour...
I'm just talking about gigs

04:12.810 --> 04:14.940
at other clubs in the city,
wherever I can book you.

04:14.980 --> 04:17.019
Different venues, different
audiences... it's the next step.

04:17.070 --> 04:19.110
Y-You got to leave
the Gaslight sometime.

04:19.149 --> 04:21.029
But I like the Gaslight.

04:21.070 --> 04:23.820
-I know you do.
-It feels like home.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.320
It'll still be there after
we kick big-time comedy ass

04:26.370 --> 04:28.490
across all five boroughs.

04:28.540 --> 04:31.790
Okay. Let's kick
some big-time comedy ass

04:31.830 --> 04:33.500
across all five boroughs.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.710
I'm making some calls tonight.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.420
And when I say five boroughs...

04:37.460 --> 04:39.210
I don't mean
Staten Island or Queens.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.960
-Right.
-Or the Bronx.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.760
Not so much Brooklyn.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.930
-Just Manhattan.
-I got the gist.

04:44.970 --> 04:46.760
(band playing fanfare intro)

04:46.800 --> 04:49.890
Can I have a fry?

04:49.930 --> 04:52.430
("God Bless America" playing)

04:52.480 --> 04:54.230
What a day, what a day!

04:54.270 --> 04:55.940
Shirley, was this
not a great day?

04:55.980 --> 04:57.980
SHIRLEY (calls):
It was a hell of a day.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.730
Joely, my boy, I want you
to know I'm very proud of you.

05:00.780 --> 05:03.320
The way you stood up
in front of all those people...

05:03.360 --> 05:05.240
you didn't sweat,
you didn't stumble.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.740
Every single person
in the place was impressed.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.830
-Thanks, Pop.
-You know, you get one chance

05:09.870 --> 05:12.830
to throw a bar mitzvah,
so you got to get it right.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.500
And boy, oh, boy,
did we get it right!

05:15.540 --> 05:17.960
How'd you like the size
of that hall, huh?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.500
And the turnout...
200 people RSVP,

05:20.550 --> 05:22.300
200 people show.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.970
This is a big day!

05:24.010 --> 05:25.760
It's a hell of a day!

05:25.800 --> 05:28.180
-SHIRLEY: Watch your mouth!
-And a great leap forward

05:28.220 --> 05:29.680
for the family.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.270
My God, boy,
just a few years ago

05:32.310 --> 05:34.930
the Maisels were lugging
pushcarts in shtetls.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.810
And look at us now...

05:36.850 --> 05:39.230
on the verge of opening
our first factory,

05:39.270 --> 05:42.320
hosting events
that people clamor to come to...

05:42.360 --> 05:44.530
important people!

05:44.570 --> 05:45.950
Go ahead.

05:45.990 --> 05:49.120
Tack the picture up
on the headboard there.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.120
(chuckles): Did you see
the looks on people's faces

05:52.160 --> 05:55.210
when I told them that your
cousin, Sergeant Meyer Schultz,

05:55.250 --> 05:58.540
piloted the plane
that struck that Jap battleship

05:58.580 --> 06:00.670
three days after Pearl Harbor?!

06:00.710 --> 06:02.670
Ah! They couldn't believe it.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.090
-He's a hero.
-You bet he's a hero.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.880
And now, Joely,
I'm gonna come clean with you,

06:07.930 --> 06:10.510
'cause you're 13
and you're a man now.

06:10.550 --> 06:12.260
He's not your cousin.

06:12.310 --> 06:14.310
-He's not?
-No, he was our paperboy,

06:14.350 --> 06:16.350
and just this side of idiot.

06:16.390 --> 06:18.350
See, it's all part
of the big picture...

06:18.390 --> 06:21.110
the hall, the lavish buffet,
the fake cousin.

06:21.150 --> 06:23.190
It's very important
that you show people

06:23.230 --> 06:25.110
you're bigger and better
than them.

06:25.150 --> 06:28.320
Because if they think it,
then you'll be it.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.990
That's how you get ahead in
the world, become a conqueror.

06:31.030 --> 06:32.910
-Yes, sir.
-I want everyone to know

06:32.950 --> 06:34.910
that you, Joel Maisel,
are a conqueror.

06:34.950 --> 06:37.290
And today, in that temple,
in that banquet hall,

06:37.330 --> 06:39.250
they learned.

06:39.290 --> 06:41.920
And now... we got to pay for it.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.960
You understand?

06:45.510 --> 06:47.800
I could've just
gone down the street,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.550
thrown your bar mitzvah
in the room in the back

06:50.590 --> 06:52.640
of your uncle's bowling alley.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.680
We would've gotten it for free.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.930
Free's good. We like free.

06:56.980 --> 07:00.310
But then, everyone who came
to that bowling alley,

07:00.350 --> 07:04.230
with its stench of beer
and piss and lane oil,

07:04.270 --> 07:06.900
they would have known
we got it for free,

07:06.940 --> 07:09.530
and that is not acceptable.

07:09.570 --> 07:11.820
No. Today these people walked in

07:11.870 --> 07:13.950
thinking their Saturday's
been ruined

07:13.990 --> 07:16.370
by another stupid bar mitzvah,

07:16.410 --> 07:19.500
but they walked out thinking:
The Maisels...

07:19.540 --> 07:22.750
are really going
to be something.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.750
♪ Sweet... ♪

07:25.800 --> 07:28.510
♪ Home... ♪

07:28.550 --> 07:30.840
It's Mommy rooster.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.680
Rise and shine, Joely.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.510
It's 7:00 in the a.m.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.010
-Good morning, Ma.
-Look at that.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.350
Another gorgeous sunshiny day.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.350
-You should ride your bike.
-I don't ride bikes anymore, Ma.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.190
Wear a hat.
You'll get a sunstroke.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.730
I'm not riding a bike, Ma.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.940
Oh, it's been so nice
having my boychik home.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.940
Oh, I'll get
your father's boxes out of here.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.240
-And the sewing machine, too.
-It's just temporary.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.070
Sure, temporary, temporary.

07:53.110 --> 07:54.870
Ooh. I'm doing a load of whites.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.620
Give me everything you got.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.700
-All your poo-poo undies.
-You don't have to.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.710
Is this a girl's suitcase?

08:00.750 --> 08:02.750
Ma, please.
I need to get ready for work.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.590
Of course. I'll make you
a plate of yummy eggs.

08:05.630 --> 08:06.920
Would you like that?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.880
Sure. Make me a plate
of yummy eggs.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.590
Now, don't bother looking
under the bed

08:10.630 --> 08:12.680
for the magazines you left
when you moved out.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.680
I found them and threw them out.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.010
Bad boy.

08:16.050 --> 08:17.970
I don't want the magazines, Ma.

08:18.010 --> 08:20.100
Eggs'll be ready in a jiff.

08:48.460 --> 08:49.960
East Coast is exactly
where we want.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.630
But the West Coast operation
is in disarray, and they say

08:52.670 --> 08:54.930
-it's all due to supply.
-The chain is gridlocked,

08:54.970 --> 08:56.590
and it's not seasonal anymore,
it's year-round.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.970
CURTIS:
Dow Chemical's scrambling

08:58.010 --> 08:59.510
for supplies themselves...
phenolic resin,

08:59.560 --> 09:01.100
formaldehyde...
they can't get enough.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.310
Just pour some formaldehyde on
a rag and hold it over my face.

09:04.350 --> 09:06.310
Their chief scientists say there
are breakthroughs within sight,

09:06.350 --> 09:07.730
but that's all they'll say.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.400
"Within sight"?
That's nice and vague.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.990
-Any suggestions? -LAWRENCE:
There's nothing to do, boss,

09:12.030 --> 09:13.440
except get in line
and wait our turn.

09:13.490 --> 09:15.360
And hope we don't
go out of business first.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.320
Excuse me?

09:18.370 --> 09:20.080
We can't just wait.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.870
Everything'll come
to a complete stop.

09:21.910 --> 09:23.750
What do you suggest, Maisel?

09:23.790 --> 09:26.210
Let's acquire the supply.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.830
What was that?

09:29.250 --> 09:31.500
We can't control
our supply of chemicals

09:31.550 --> 09:33.510
if we can't control
the supplier.

09:33.550 --> 09:35.800
So... let's become the supplier.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.260
And how would that work?
We buy Union Carbide?

09:38.300 --> 09:40.600
-(man chuckles)
-We start small, Curtis.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.430
We acquire a local lab.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.810
We dig through universities
for talent.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.980
We got a few of those
in New York.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.020
-A few. -We hire our own
technicians, our own scientists.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.690
We build our own chain
and become our own suppliers.

09:52.730 --> 09:54.320
They turn chemicals
into plastic,

09:54.360 --> 09:56.650
and we turn plastic
into toys and coasters.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.870
Hell, let's make
the chemicals, too.

09:59.910 --> 10:03.750
Life magazine says
conglomerates are the future.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.790
Francis, call Chase Manhattan.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.330
Let's take some baby steps.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.790
Set up a line of credit,
see what's out there.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.210
And we need to call the
West Coast, give 'em a heads-up.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.800
-Curtis, give 'em a buzz.
-Will do, boss.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.380
We should send the CFO
out there, too.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.010
As soon as possible.
Now, what else, guys?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.590
MAN: Just a couple
of personnel things.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.390
IMOGENE: Can you believe
our babies are turning four?

10:22.430 --> 10:24.220
-They just turned three.
-They'll be in school

10:24.270 --> 10:25.640
before you know it,
then college,

10:25.680 --> 10:27.270
then marriage,
they'll have babies,

10:27.310 --> 10:29.190
become grandparents...
we'll be dead by then.

10:29.230 --> 10:30.860
-Yay.
-Sorry.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.980
Wait. You put marbles in here.
I'm doing marbles.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.900
-I thought you were doing gum.
-And you're putting

10:34.940 --> 10:36.650
Tiny Tina baby carriages
in the boys' bags.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.990
Oh, I told you, we should get
gender-specific bags.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.240
-Too much chatter.
-Sorry, Papa.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.370
-And what is all this? -It's
for Ethan's birthday party.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.000
-This is too much for him.
-This is for the kids

10:47.040 --> 10:49.120
-who come to the party.
-It's all their birthdays?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.460
-If everyone gets a gift, it'll
keep the screaming down. -So,

10:51.500 --> 10:53.460
everyone gets a gift,
everyone gets a compliment,

10:53.500 --> 10:55.760
everyone gets a hug...
you're not preparing

10:55.800 --> 10:58.130
-these kids for the real world.
-Don't worry,

10:58.170 --> 11:00.130
we'll teach the kids how cruel
the world is next year,

11:00.180 --> 11:02.350
-when they're five. -Did you
need something, Mr. Weissman?

11:02.390 --> 11:04.720
Yes. I need you to know
that I can hear

11:04.760 --> 11:06.640
every word you're saying,
and I'm grading papers.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.730
So please, Miriam, Dody...

11:08.770 --> 11:11.060
(quietly):
try to keep it down.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.560
Okay.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.030
Why does he call me Dody?

11:16.070 --> 11:17.690
She was my friend growing up.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.320
It's sort of a catchall
for whoever he sees me with.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.860
Wait, there's
already gum in here.

11:21.910 --> 11:23.660
-I put it in there.
-I'm doing gum.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.870
But I thought you
were doing candy cigarettes.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.660
-Starting over.
-(groans)

11:28.660 --> 11:30.040
(Imogene sighs)

11:30.080 --> 11:32.330
So, we should finalize
the guest list.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.460
-It's the same as last year.
-Is it?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.460
What's the confusion, Dody?

11:36.500 --> 11:37.630
Is Joel coming?

11:37.670 --> 11:38.840
Of course he's coming...

11:38.880 --> 11:40.260
it's his son's birthday.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.800
Is he bringing her?

11:41.840 --> 11:43.890
Only if he wants
to be beaten to death

11:43.930 --> 11:45.810
by, I don't know,
everyone at the party.

11:45.850 --> 11:48.600
Okay. But we'd better figure out
who knows what, compare stories.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.640
-Stories? -The stories
you've each been telling people

11:50.690 --> 11:52.600
about your situation...
I've completely lost track.

11:52.650 --> 11:55.610
And I have no idea
what you've been telling people.

11:55.650 --> 11:58.650
Every word, as if broadcast
over a microphone.

11:58.690 --> 12:01.530
-We're almost done.
-You keep starting over.

12:01.570 --> 12:02.910
She talked me
out of gender-specific bags,

12:02.950 --> 12:05.240
-Mr. Weissman.
-(exhales)

12:05.280 --> 12:08.200
Set up a line like Henry Ford.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.870
Keep the piles separate,

12:09.910 --> 12:11.960
then pass the bags
from one to the other.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.920
Candy cigarettes, pass the bag,

12:13.960 --> 12:15.880
a Silly Putty,
pass the bag, and so on.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.960
Thanks for
the industrial education, Papa.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.960
And, young lady,
I heard through the door

12:20.010 --> 12:22.180
that your name is not Dody...
what is your name?

12:22.220 --> 12:23.470
Imogene.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.930
I'm not gonna remember that.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.730
The Murphys... do they know all?

12:30.770 --> 12:33.730
I'm not sure. I-I lied
to some people at first,

12:33.770 --> 12:35.560
then started telling people
that we were separated

12:35.610 --> 12:37.980
-but trying to work it out.
-The Turners?

12:38.020 --> 12:40.740
Think that Joel is
on a business trip in Poland.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.030
-The Rivingtons?
-Know that you're separated

12:43.070 --> 12:45.110
and know that Joel moved out.
Someone got to them before me.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.120
But they don't know
that Joel's living with Penny.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.200
He's not living with Penny
anymore.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.330
What? Since when?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.540
Joel's secretary called.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.960
Gave me a new home number
for him.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.460
It was his parents'.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.460
What happened?

12:55.500 --> 12:56.710
I don't know.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.130
Wow.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.710
As the world turns.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.510
-Mm-hmm.
-So,

13:01.550 --> 13:03.760
who else? Uh, the Gertzs.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.590
MIDGE: Think that Joel is
on a very long business trip

13:06.640 --> 13:08.930
-but suspect more.
-The Salings?

13:08.970 --> 13:10.850
MIDGE: Think that we are
renovating the apartment

13:10.890 --> 13:13.180
and that Joel is traveling
for work.

13:13.230 --> 13:15.650
-(indistinct chatter)
-(commentator speaking on radio)

13:20.820 --> 13:22.490
Mm.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.120
What the hell?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.780
Harry, good. Can we talk?

13:29.830 --> 13:31.200
Oh, Susie. Sure.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.040
Hey, uh, guys,
can you give us the room?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.870
-Susie needs to talk to me.
-(chuckling)

13:34.910 --> 13:36.330
You don't have to clear
the room.

13:36.370 --> 13:38.000
I'm not gonna clear
the goddamn room.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.670
Jesus Christ, Susie,
get a phone.

13:39.710 --> 13:42.260
-I have a phone.
-Well, use it.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.170
But face-to-face is better.
That's what you always said.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.170
Don't listen to me.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.760
Oh, so smooth.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.930
It's like a baby's bottom.
(inhales)

13:48.970 --> 13:50.350
And so fragrant.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.270
Okay, okay.

13:52.310 --> 13:54.100
Tell me why you're here.

13:54.140 --> 13:56.020
The comic I told you about,
the one I'm representing.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.770
-The girl?
-Yeah, the girl.

13:57.810 --> 14:00.190
She's been killing at
the Gaslight, night after night.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.190
What's her name again?

14:01.230 --> 14:02.690
It's Amanda Gleason.

14:02.730 --> 14:03.820
Shit name.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.650
Fake name but a great comic.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.990
She'd be the perfect opening act
for Sophie Lennon.

14:08.030 --> 14:11.160
-Get out of here. Sophie's one
of my biggest clients. -I know.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.410
Where do you come off,
asking for something like this?

14:13.450 --> 14:16.290
-I'm not talking about opening
for her at the Copa. -Then what?

14:16.330 --> 14:17.790
Sophie plays those joints
in Jersey

14:17.830 --> 14:19.130
when she's working up a new act.

14:19.170 --> 14:20.960
Those little dives, unannounced.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.800
Let my girl open for her there.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.050
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.380
That's a shit gig.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.800
It's a terrible gig.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.340
The audience is there
for Sophie.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.680
-The opener gets eaten alive.
-We're game.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.930
Slot went to Markie Diamond
once. You hear of him?

14:32.970 --> 14:34.520
-No.
-And to Adam Young once.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.810
-You hear of him?
-No.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.230
Danny LeMonde? Scoop LeMonde?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.940
-Brothers?
-They're in plumbing now.

14:38.980 --> 14:41.610
-I get the point.
-She'd be a sacrificial lamb.

14:41.650 --> 14:44.360
Then cut her up into chops
and serve her with mint sauce.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.610
I want this for her.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.360
I'd need to see her first.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.780
She's got a tight ten.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.490
I can set you up any night
you like.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.490
-I'm not going to the Gaslight.
-Why not?

14:52.530 --> 14:53.910
I don't go downtown anymore.

14:53.950 --> 14:55.910
You cut your teeth
haunting dives downtown.

14:55.950 --> 14:57.160
I got nice suits now.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.790
Why you wearing this one?

14:58.830 --> 15:01.250
The Stork Club is as south
as I want to go.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.500
She'll perform anywhere
you want,

15:02.540 --> 15:04.210
but the Gaslight's her home.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.800
(sighs)

15:05.840 --> 15:07.920
It's a really shit gig.

15:07.970 --> 15:08.920
(chuckles softly)

15:08.970 --> 15:10.340
She's gonna bomb.

15:10.380 --> 15:11.510
(applause)

15:11.550 --> 15:13.970
SOPHIE:
Put that on your plate!

15:14.010 --> 15:16.560
Yeah, I'm from Queens,

15:16.600 --> 15:18.230
born and raised.

15:18.270 --> 15:21.060
Queens is the place you go
to get to the airport...

15:21.100 --> 15:23.440
-to get the hell out of Queens.
-(laughter)

15:23.480 --> 15:26.280
(laughs)
Put that on your plate. Ugh.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.110
In Queens, we got a neighborhood
called Flushing,

15:29.150 --> 15:31.780
which isn't a name
so much as a suggestion

15:31.820 --> 15:33.870
for what to do with the place.

15:33.910 --> 15:37.410
-(laughter)
-Put that on your plate!

15:37.450 --> 15:40.410
(chuckles) You know, sometimes
when I'm on the telephone

15:40.460 --> 15:42.960
and I say my name,
Sophie Lennon,

15:43.000 --> 15:46.710
-people think they hear
"Sophia Loren." Mm. -(awwing)

15:46.750 --> 15:49.550
Funny, nobody ever makes
that mistake in person.

15:49.590 --> 15:50.800
(laughter)

15:50.840 --> 15:53.220
You hear those laughs?

15:53.260 --> 15:54.800
They're big laughs.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.720
Are you sure my stuff
is funny enough for Harry?

15:56.760 --> 15:59.060
Positive. Why? Aren't you sure?

15:59.100 --> 16:01.310
-I'm pretty sure.
-Pretty sure?

16:01.350 --> 16:04.400
I went out on a limb for you
here, sister, so be damn sure.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.400
I'm... damn sure, okay?

16:06.440 --> 16:09.070
I mean, really.

16:09.110 --> 16:11.240
Yeah, I like to eat!

16:11.280 --> 16:14.160
I'm so fat...

16:14.200 --> 16:15.830
ALL:
How fat are you?

16:15.870 --> 16:19.160
I'm so fat
that I used to look Rubenesque,

16:19.200 --> 16:22.540
and now I just look
like a Reuben sandwich.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.540
(laughter)

16:24.580 --> 16:27.550
I grew up listening
to this woman on the radio.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.880
-Me, too.
-Even my dad laughed at her.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.470
He tried not to, but he did.

16:31.510 --> 16:34.140
She got a lot of us
through the Depression.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.800
How old are you?

16:35.850 --> 16:37.970
I'm not telling you.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.810
I can't even go to the beach
anymore.

16:39.850 --> 16:41.640
Last time I was at the beach,

16:41.680 --> 16:44.730
some marine biology students
started poking me with a stick,

16:44.770 --> 16:46.560
looking for my blowhole!

16:46.610 --> 16:47.820
(laughter)

16:47.860 --> 16:49.900
I walked by a construction site,

16:49.940 --> 16:52.990
and the workers start whistling
at each other!

16:53.030 --> 16:54.320
(laughter)

16:54.360 --> 16:56.240
Should I talk about my husbands?

16:56.280 --> 16:57.950
(cheering and applause)

16:57.990 --> 17:00.200
All right then.
You asked for it.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.540
Oh, my first husband and me,
we didn't get along too good.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.540
He was too proper.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.710
He spoke the Queen's English,

17:07.750 --> 17:11.300
whereas I spoke Queens' English.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.550
Bop!

17:12.589 --> 17:13.800
(laughter)

17:13.839 --> 17:16.220
(cheering and applause)

17:17.680 --> 17:21.270
Oh! Put that on your plate!

17:26.020 --> 17:27.980
SOPHIE:
Here you go.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.730
(chuckles)
What's your name, sweetie?

17:29.770 --> 17:31.230
Linda. I'm from Queens, too.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.070
Oh, Linda,
you have my deepest sympathies.

17:34.110 --> 17:35.910
-(chuckles)
-(laughs) There you go.

17:35.950 --> 17:38.410
-Hello, my loves.
-WOMAN: I'm an enormous fan.

17:38.450 --> 17:41.160
-How 'bout that? I'm
an enormous comedian. -Harry.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.410
SOPHIE (laughs):
There you go, honey.

17:43.450 --> 17:44.830
-Enjoy.
-Hello, Susie.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.000
Oh, thanks for putting on
your fancy duds.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.170
Shows a lot of respect
for the occasion here.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.000
Listen, I know it's late
and you have a catheter

17:51.050 --> 17:53.420
that needs changing, so let me
introduce you to my girl.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.670
-This is...
-Amanda Gleason.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.430
-Amanda Gleason.
-Nice to meet you.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.430
-You like the show?
-I loved it.

17:58.470 --> 18:00.350
She's hysterical.
She's timeless.

18:00.390 --> 18:01.850
She's the best in the biz.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.060
Let me introduce you. Sophie.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.560
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.650
Oh, hey, don't worry.
I'll be back.

18:08.690 --> 18:11.860
Sophie, this is Susie Myerson
and Amanda Gleason.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.690
Amanda may be opening for you

18:13.730 --> 18:15.490
-in Jersey.
-Nice to meet you.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.360
-Ah, Sophie don't shake hands.
-Oh.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.030
-Sophie shakes bodies. Come
here, you. -Oh. Oh. (laughing)

18:20.070 --> 18:22.450
(laughs)
Harry, make sure

18:22.490 --> 18:24.500
you cheat toward
this adorable young thing.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.410
-MIDGE: Oh. (chuckles)
-I will.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.080
-So, you're gonna be
the appetizer, huh? -I'm hoping.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.920
Well, it's a tough gig.
They tell you that?

18:30.960 --> 18:33.340
-They did. I'm game.
-Good for you.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.090
Why don't you come over
to my house this week.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.090
I like to get to know
my acolytes.

18:37.130 --> 18:38.340
I'm at your disposal.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.340
Harry, set it up.

18:40.390 --> 18:42.640
Look at those beauty-ful people.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.470
So long, all!

18:45.520 --> 18:47.270
Come here, my darlings.

18:47.310 --> 18:48.690
Susie, I'll be in touch.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.690
-Thanks, Harry.
-Okay.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.360
(both chuckle)

18:52.400 --> 18:54.320
SOPHIE:
Oh! Where'd you get that hat?

18:56.740 --> 18:59.530
There's still lumps in there,
Zelda. They all have to go.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.620
-Yes, ma'am. -It's not
just about what he can chew.

19:01.660 --> 19:04.620
-Every lump is a choking hazard.
-Who's at risk of choking?

19:04.660 --> 19:07.040
Your father's bringing Mordecai
Glickman home for dinner.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.960
Professor Glickman? He was
an old man when I was a kid.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.380
-He still is. -He had no liver
when I was a kid.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.210
He still doesn't.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.130
-Too firm. Lose the peaches.
-Yes, ma'am.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.380
You're eating with us? Please
say you're eating with us.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.970
-I was planning on it. -Your
father especially wanted you

19:21.010 --> 19:22.640
to eat with us.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.640
-Too stringy. Lose the yams.
-Yes, ma'am.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.720
Grab some bowls. They'll want
to eat as soon as they come in,

19:26.770 --> 19:28.890
before Mordecai falls asleep.

19:28.930 --> 19:31.400
(sighs)

19:31.440 --> 19:32.860
So, remember,

19:32.900 --> 19:35.190
he's got 90% hearing loss
in his left ear,

19:35.230 --> 19:37.360
and his right ear
is completely deaf.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.200
-So yell into his left ear.
-And sometimes he sees stars

19:40.240 --> 19:42.030
in front of his eyes
and he'll comment on them.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.700
He'll say, "Look at all
the pretty stars, everyone."

19:43.740 --> 19:45.870
-Just go along.
-We're all seeing pretty stars.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.450
-Mm. -Is it okay if I seat
Professor Glickman here, ma'am?

19:48.500 --> 19:50.790
Oh, he shouldn't sit there.
If he falls, he'll hit his head

19:50.830 --> 19:52.630
-on the mirror.
-But if he falls over there,

19:52.670 --> 19:54.630
-he'll hit his head
on the drink cart. -(sighs)

19:54.670 --> 19:57.130
I should have had Abe tell me
which way he was tilting today.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.380
Have some pillows handy.

19:58.420 --> 20:00.470
-(door opens)
-ABE: Hello!

20:00.510 --> 20:02.510
We're here!

20:05.220 --> 20:06.180
Abe?

20:06.220 --> 20:08.850
Rose, this is David Blumenthal.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.850
David, this is my wife, Rose.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.350
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Weissman.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.690
-Likewise.
-And this is my daughter,

20:14.730 --> 20:17.400
-Miriam.
-Very nice to meet you, Miriam.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.940
Nice to meet you, too,
Mr. Blumenthal.

20:19.990 --> 20:21.200
Please, call me David.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.530
David.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.950
Zelda, why don't you take
Mr. Blumenthal's coat.

20:25.990 --> 20:26.990
Yes, ma'am.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.580
(quietly):
This is not Professor Glickman.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.040
-Of course it isn't.
-I thought

20:32.080 --> 20:33.750
you were bringing home
Professor Glickman.

20:33.790 --> 20:35.670
I said "a colleague,"
not "Professor Glickman."

20:35.710 --> 20:37.340
David, please join us
in the living room.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.170
We can chat a bit before dinner.

20:39.210 --> 20:41.920
Mmm, this looks...

20:41.970 --> 20:43.180
charmingly eclectic.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.680
Is this dinner, Rose?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.430
It's dinner
for Mordecai Glickman.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.850
I wasn't aware you were bringing
home someone with teeth.

20:48.890 --> 20:51.020
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles) Well, David,

20:51.060 --> 20:52.270
would you like a drink?

20:52.310 --> 20:54.690
We have... peppermint schnapps.

20:54.730 --> 20:57.110
Rose, why is there
just peppermint schnapps?

20:57.150 --> 20:58.730
It's what Professor Glickman
drinks.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.360
I have scotch somewhere.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.530
I'm fine, thank you.
I don't need a drink.

21:02.570 --> 21:05.030
I hope you like applesauce and
peach slices, Mr. Blumenthal.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.070
-I like whatever you're serving.
-Good, because that's what

21:07.120 --> 21:09.990
we're serving: applesauce and
peach slices and mashed potatoes

21:10.040 --> 21:12.410
and consommé and hard-boiled
eggs and pureed cauliflower

21:12.450 --> 21:13.960
and pudding for dessert.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.370
Your teeth will wonder
what they're there for.

21:15.420 --> 21:17.380
Miriam, will you help me
in the kitchen, please?

21:17.420 --> 21:19.040
Mm.

21:19.090 --> 21:21.760
Excuse me.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.840
So, David, which part
of Westchester are you from?

21:28.140 --> 21:29.970
What do we have
that's real food?

21:30.010 --> 21:32.060
-I have steaks, but they're
frozen. -This is a nightmare.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.730
-The nerve of him.
-The nerve of him.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.230
You said he was bringing home
Professor Glickman.

21:35.270 --> 21:36.560
I said he was bringing home
a colleague,

21:36.600 --> 21:38.150
and it's always
Professor Glickman.

21:38.190 --> 21:39.820
-Is this a set-up?
-Of course it's a set-up.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.820
Why is he doing this?
Why is he trying to set me up

21:41.860 --> 21:44.070
-with some guy? -Your father's
nothing but a common souteneur.

21:44.110 --> 21:46.070
-A what?
-A pimp. Your father's a pimp.

21:46.110 --> 21:48.740
-He's not a pimp. -He's trying
to breed you, like a prize mare.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.490
Just the presumption
of what he's doing.

21:50.530 --> 21:52.580
-I'm so mad. -And this man
is not even attractive.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.160
Well, he's not unattractive.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.750
Oh, Miriam, you are not going
out with this man.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.210
Of course I'm not going out
with this man.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.750
But you said he was attractive.

21:58.790 --> 21:59.960
-(arguing continues)
-I had a car for a while.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.460
A '55 Bel Air.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.210
But the upkeep was enormous,

22:03.260 --> 22:05.630
and parking in the city's
murder, so...

22:05.670 --> 22:08.140
Yes, well,
parking and upkeep is...

22:08.180 --> 22:10.720
-ROSE: So you would encourage
your father to be a pimp? -Look,

22:10.760 --> 22:11.930
he's a lot of things,
but I don't think

22:11.970 --> 22:13.180
it's fair to call him a pimp.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.180
ROSE:
Well, he's being a pimp.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.190
Upkeep is pretty onerous.

22:16.230 --> 22:18.520
David, will you excuse me
a moment?

22:18.560 --> 22:20.650
The girls sound
a little... excited.

22:20.690 --> 22:22.190
-Of course.
-ROSE: So it's my fault?

22:22.230 --> 22:24.530
MIDGE: I should have eaten
at the Automat tonight.

22:24.570 --> 22:27.530
-That's what I think. -Miriam,
stop it. -What is going on?

22:27.570 --> 22:29.910
-We can hear every word
you're saying. -Abe Weissman,

22:29.950 --> 22:32.280
what made you think you could
just bring a man home like this?

22:32.330 --> 22:34.750
He's a colleague. I bring
colleagues home for dinner.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.580
-He's not just a colleague.
-You brought him home

22:36.620 --> 22:39.000
-to set him up with Miriam.
-I did no such thing.

22:39.040 --> 22:42.210
-Come on. -David Blumenthal
is a colleague at my school.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.050
-Is he a bachelor?
-I think so.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.800
-Oh, Abe! -What, I can only
bring home married colleagues?

22:46.840 --> 22:48.550
-Mm. -Come on,
you never bring anyone home,

22:48.590 --> 22:50.800
and tonight you show up
with this attractive young guy?

22:50.840 --> 22:52.890
-Semi-attractive.
-He's not unattractive.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.310
-Which side are you on here?
-His looks have nothing to do

22:55.350 --> 22:58.310
with this. Now, please,
can we get dinner on the table?

22:58.350 --> 22:59.390
Dinner's a disaster.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.400
He says he's not picky.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.980
Oh, and Mordecai Glickman
is no longer with us.

23:04.020 --> 23:06.990
-Since when? -Since we went
to his funeral four years ago.

23:07.030 --> 23:08.150
That's right.
It was the liveliest

23:08.200 --> 23:09.490
I'd seen Mordecai in years.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.530
Dinner, please.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.660
You think
he's telling the truth?

23:14.700 --> 23:17.120
I don't know anything anymore.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.000
(Midge sighs)

23:21.040 --> 23:22.420
Thursday is soft foods night

23:22.460 --> 23:24.000
here at the Weissman home,
David.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.090
I hope you don't mind.

23:25.130 --> 23:26.590
I'm anything but picky, Abe.

23:26.630 --> 23:29.340
-(chuckles)
-Please, everybody, sit.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.390
(clears throat)

23:37.560 --> 23:41.400
So, David here
is a divorce lawyer.

23:45.110 --> 23:48.360
David, can I dish you up
some peach slices?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.740
-You said he was a colleague.
-I do teach law part-time.

23:50.780 --> 23:52.950
-Shut up, David.
-She needs an attorney.

23:52.990 --> 23:54.530
-She does not need an attorney.
-Maybe I should go.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.370
Papa, this was not the time
or the place.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.120
Mr. Blumenthal, I'm afraid
my husband brought you here

23:58.160 --> 23:59.450
under false pretenses.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.580
An informative colloquy
can't hurt.

24:01.620 --> 24:02.790
I can just leave my card
with you.

24:02.830 --> 24:03.920
She doesn't need your card.

24:03.960 --> 24:04.920
Papa, can we...

24:04.960 --> 24:06.460
colloquy in your study, please?

24:06.500 --> 24:07.460
The food will get cold.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.710
It's already cold.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
-David, excuse us.
-I understand.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.590
No, there's nothing for you
to understand, Mr. Blumenthal.

24:12.630 --> 24:13.680
-Mm-mm.
-Rose,

24:13.720 --> 24:15.470
please, my study.

24:19.470 --> 24:22.600
Don't you dare pull paperwork
out of that briefcase of yours.

24:24.610 --> 24:27.730
Papa, you should have told me
you were doing this.

24:27.770 --> 24:31.070
We should not be in denial
about what's happening here.

24:31.110 --> 24:32.650
Who are you to say that?

24:32.700 --> 24:34.320
-I'm her father.
-For now.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.070
What does that even mean?

24:36.120 --> 24:38.580
And why would you think
I would bring someone home

24:38.620 --> 24:40.870
-to set you up with? -Because
you're a common souteneur.

24:40.910 --> 24:43.250
-A what?
-A pimp. Papa, you're a pimp.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.920
I beg your pardon.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.670
-Sounds better in French.
-I wouldn't set you up

24:46.710 --> 24:48.380
with anyone.
I don't even know your type.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.130
-Joel's her type.
-Miriam doesn't have a type.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.800
My God, before Joel,

24:52.840 --> 24:54.890
you were with that ultra white
Palmer Witherspoon.

24:54.930 --> 24:56.600
Oh, that name you remember?

24:56.640 --> 24:58.560
He was like a pole-vaulter
from Triumph of the Will.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.680
Papa, this is my concern,
not yours.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.230
You're my daughter.

25:03.270 --> 25:04.730
Your concerns are my concerns.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.940
Miriam and Joel
are not divorcing.

25:06.980 --> 25:10.780
Rose, we need to talk
about this.

25:10.820 --> 25:13.700
They live apart.
She has a job.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.410
He moved in with that girl.

25:15.450 --> 25:18.580
No one at Ethan's party
has been told the same thing.

25:18.620 --> 25:21.290
It'll be 20 adults
all sitting six feet apart

25:21.330 --> 25:23.040
so they can't compare stories

25:23.080 --> 25:26.210
with Dody running interference.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.880
(sighs)

25:27.920 --> 25:29.880
Things need to move on.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.010
Miriam needs to be settled.

25:32.050 --> 25:35.550
And that means
they need to divorce.

25:35.590 --> 25:37.430
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.760
Now I'm gonna go to the kitchen
and grab some celery

25:39.810 --> 25:42.220
because we all need
something fibrous to eat.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.850
(door closes)

25:46.900 --> 25:49.150
Her name's Imogene.

(sighs) Rose.

26:40.910 --> 26:42.280
Privacy, please.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.700
We need to talk.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.660
You bring that man home.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.460
A lawyer.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.710
I could strangle you.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.250
I want to tell you something.

26:51.290 --> 26:53.590
Well, tell it to your colleague.

26:53.630 --> 26:56.550
You need to know... Rose!

27:01.390 --> 27:03.810
You need to know
about Miriam and Joel.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.850
What about them?

27:05.890 --> 27:10.150
Joel is not going to come back.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.560
How do you know?

27:11.610 --> 27:15.780
Because he already did...
come back.

27:15.820 --> 27:18.450
And she turned him away.

27:18.490 --> 27:20.280
"She" who?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.530
Miriam.

27:21.570 --> 27:22.910
-Our Miriam?
-Yes.

27:22.950 --> 27:24.240
I don't understand.

27:27.790 --> 27:30.960
About a month ago,
Joel came here

27:31.000 --> 27:34.590
and he asked to come back.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.670
She said no.

27:36.710 --> 27:41.010
-She said no.
-She said no.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.060
And you didn't tell me.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.100
I didn't know how.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.100
And she didn't tell me.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.400
She probably didn't know how.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.730
Well, thank you very much.

28:01.030 --> 28:03.370
DRINA! I need the ball.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.990
And the cards.

28:05.030 --> 28:07.490
I need the ball and the cards
and two cups of tea.

28:07.540 --> 28:10.410
-WOMAN: Hello.
-DRINA?

28:12.330 --> 28:14.710
Welcome.
Please, have a seat.

28:14.750 --> 28:15.960
Who are you?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I am Madame Cosma.

28:18.050 --> 28:20.010
I see your future
so you don't have to.

28:20.050 --> 28:22.090
N-No. What happened to DRINA?

28:22.130 --> 28:24.800
DRINA, she's home now.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.970
DRINA went back to the old
country without telling me?

28:27.010 --> 28:29.470
The old country,
she's from the Bronx.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.770
Oh, no, no, no.
Drina's from Eastern Europe.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.270
A small city
just outside Bucharest.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.310
Okay.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.980
I need to see her.
She tells my fortune.

28:37.020 --> 28:39.190
She reads my tea leaves.
She helps guide my life.

28:39.230 --> 28:41.650
Well, now I am the person
who's gonna do that,

28:41.700 --> 28:43.200
but between you and me,

28:43.240 --> 28:45.870
the tea leaf thing,
kind of a scam.

28:45.910 --> 28:49.240
Pyromancy. Gazing into fire...

28:49.290 --> 28:51.660
Much more accurate,
prettier, too.

28:51.710 --> 28:54.710
-This isn't happening.
-The price is the same.

28:54.750 --> 28:57.590
And if you pay in advance,
your tenth visit is free.

28:57.630 --> 28:59.210
Plus, I throw in a charm.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.720
I don't believe this.
What am I gonna do?

29:01.760 --> 29:05.890
I don't even have to consult
the cards to see...

29:05.930 --> 29:09.510
that it's all going wrong
for you.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.230
(door opens and closes)

29:29.490 --> 29:31.040
Hello, Abe.

29:32.660 --> 29:35.960
Abe. Abe!

29:36.000 --> 29:39.170
I just need a moment, please.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.170
Okay, I know you hate me.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.710
I don't blame you.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.840
I'm not feeling too hot
about myself, either.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.840
I just wanted to talk to you
about what my father said

29:47.890 --> 29:51.390
at that dinner
a couple months ago.

29:51.430 --> 29:53.100
For Professor Weissman?

29:53.140 --> 29:55.520
I'll take it.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.810
Abe, you got a package.

30:03.490 --> 30:05.990
Okay, then I'll talk
to your door.

30:06.030 --> 30:08.070
It's true what he said.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.080
Miriam and I were broke.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.450
I mean, flat broke.

30:11.490 --> 30:12.830
We were spending
more than we made,

30:12.870 --> 30:14.750
couldn't save anything.

30:14.790 --> 30:17.210
But she had no idea
that that was the case.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.210
She'd ask about money and I'd
say we're fine, we're good.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.750
She trusted me.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.550
She's always trusted me.

30:25.590 --> 30:28.050
There's a lot of things
I can't make right again,

30:28.090 --> 30:30.510
but there's some things I can.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.850
Thanks.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.400
Table.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.440
I've been stepping up
at work, Abe.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.950
And I'm in line for a new job.

30:46.990 --> 30:48.570
It's a pretty big promotion.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.410
Well, good for you.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.370
I'm not bragging,
it just means...

30:54.410 --> 30:57.080
Look.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.540
It comes with a raise,
a pretty big one.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.540
And I've been
crunching the numbers.

31:02.590 --> 31:04.300
Uh-huh.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.670
Miriam and the kids can't live
at your place forever.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.590
They're gonna need their own
place, three bedrooms at least.

31:09.630 --> 31:11.180
I can swing that now.

31:11.220 --> 31:12.800
And she wants the kids
to go to private school?

31:12.850 --> 31:14.220
Yes, she does.

31:14.260 --> 31:16.180
Ethan to Collegiate
and Esther to Brearley.

31:16.220 --> 31:19.230
Tuition's about $1,100 each,
and I budgeted for that, too.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.900
Then there's clothes,
entertainment.

31:21.940 --> 31:23.730
I want them to go
to shows and movies,

31:23.770 --> 31:26.320
take piano lessons,
go on vacations.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.740
It's all here.

31:27.780 --> 31:29.740
Everything they need
is accounted for.

31:29.780 --> 31:31.870
And my new salary
will cover it all.

31:31.910 --> 31:34.740
And if you don't get
the new job?

31:34.780 --> 31:37.290
Then I'll go back
to working for my father.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.870
Either way, that is the salary.

31:39.910 --> 31:43.880
Joel, you know that I am
pretty good at math.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.670
-Right?
-Yes.

31:45.710 --> 31:48.050
There's nothing left for you.

31:48.090 --> 31:49.840
I'll be fine.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.140
-You'll be fine?
-The new job takes me

31:52.180 --> 31:53.510
to the West Coast a lot,

31:53.550 --> 31:54.800
eventually,
I'll be moving there.

31:54.850 --> 31:56.060
To California?

31:56.100 --> 31:57.430
Miriam said you hate California.

31:57.470 --> 31:59.310
Doesn't matter.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.810
But what about the kids?

32:01.850 --> 32:04.150
They're taken care of.
Anything they want.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.940
But you won't see them.

32:05.980 --> 32:08.610
They don't need me.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.030
Joel.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.280
So do me a favor, Abe?

32:15.330 --> 32:17.290
Be the go-between on this.

32:17.330 --> 32:19.370
Tell Midge that she
and the kids are all set.

32:21.290 --> 32:23.040
You'll do that?

32:23.080 --> 32:25.290
I'll do that.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.300
This is good, Abe.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.090
You should be happy.

32:31.130 --> 32:33.550
Okay.

32:33.590 --> 32:36.260
I'll be happy.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.230
(car horn honks in distance)

32:50.740 --> 32:52.740
(grand musical tones play)

32:56.740 --> 32:58.200
Good afternoon.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.620
Miss Gleason, I presume.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.660
Yes. Good afternoon.

33:01.710 --> 33:02.960
Miss Lennon is expecting you.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.460
Please come in.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.000
Thank you.

33:10.420 --> 33:13.220
So who composed that doorbell?
Puccini?

33:13.260 --> 33:14.680
I wouldn't know.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.550
Probably just some guy
at the doorbell factory.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.470
Your coat, miss?

33:19.510 --> 33:21.470
Oh, yes.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.060
Wow. Such a big foyer.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.770
You should put in
a ping-pong table.

33:25.810 --> 33:27.980
-Jenkins?
-Oh.

33:28.020 --> 33:31.030
-Oh, hi, Jenkins.
-The lady's coat.

33:40.030 --> 33:42.040
They look like
they could use some water.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.040
Miss Lennon
will be down shortly.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.620
SOPHIE:
Miss Lennon is down now.

33:46.670 --> 33:48.670
(chuckles)

33:50.550 --> 33:52.920
Sophie. Hi.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.880
(chuckling):
So good to see you.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.800
Oh, and you're on time.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.640
That's so unlike a comic.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.390
-I tend to be punctual.
-Mmm.

34:00.430 --> 34:03.480
The lady was inquiring as to the
provenance of the doorbell.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.440
It was a joke.
I said Puccini.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.850
It was Aaron Copland.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.940
Wait. Aaron Copland
wrote your doorbell?

34:08.980 --> 34:10.440
It's something he does.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.030
Aaron writes doorbells
for all his friends.

34:13.070 --> 34:16.610
I guess even composers need to
let loose sometimes.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.320
Dawes, how is the light
in the Blue Room today?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.909
I got a terrible night's sleep,

34:19.949 --> 34:22.290
and you know that makes my eyes
sensitive to light.

34:22.330 --> 34:24.750
Is the light caustic today?

34:24.790 --> 34:26.750
I'll check, ma'am.

34:39.550 --> 34:42.350
The light is not caustic, ma'am.

34:42.389 --> 34:44.429
The Blue Room it is.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.489
Wow. Wow.

34:56.530 --> 34:59.070
I had to fire six designers
to get it here.

34:59.110 --> 35:00.780
I'm not sure it was worth it.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.200
-This is gorgeous.
-Don't touch.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.910
That was Cole Porter's.

35:04.950 --> 35:08.920
He wrote "Begin the Beguine"
on that very instrument.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.170
And this rug was once owned
by George Gershwin.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.710
Should I walk on it?

35:12.750 --> 35:15.760
Lightly. You'll have the
grand tour after we eat.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.260
Terrific.
I'd love to see the kitchen.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.010
The kitchen? Really?

35:20.050 --> 35:21.550
Why?

35:21.590 --> 35:23.300
Because I love kitchens.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.520
Really? Kitchens?

35:25.560 --> 35:27.100
Why?

35:28.350 --> 35:30.100
-They're neat.
-To be honest,

35:30.140 --> 35:32.560
I haven't been in our kitchen
in quite some time.

35:32.610 --> 35:35.650
I'm on the road, I'm upstairs,

35:35.690 --> 35:38.110
but if it means that much
to you, we'll find it.

35:38.150 --> 35:40.280
Ready for tea, ma'am?

35:40.320 --> 35:42.450
Yes, Dawes.
Let's sit.

35:46.160 --> 35:49.210
So the bread for the finger
sandwiches is from Provence.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.420
Uh, the macaroons
are French, too.

35:51.460 --> 35:55.420
Clotted cream is from London,
of course, and the scones.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.840
I would never eat
a domestic scone.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.590
Shall we prepare your plate,
miss?

35:59.630 --> 36:01.260
Yes, thank you.

36:01.300 --> 36:04.470
And I will have my usual, Dawes.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.600
So... this is you.

36:07.640 --> 36:08.890
This is me.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.940
-Surprised?
-A little.

36:10.980 --> 36:13.480
You were expecting
Sophie Lennon, weren't ya?

36:13.520 --> 36:16.820
-Yes. -(chuckles) It's a very
successful charade, isn't it?

36:16.860 --> 36:19.940
-Amazing.
-It's all fat suit and makeup.

36:19.990 --> 36:21.570
How do people not know?

36:21.610 --> 36:24.200
I've never seen a picture of you
out of character.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.160
I pay the publicists,
I pay the rags.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.080
I paid for Walter Winchell's
summer home, for Christ's sake.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.660
Fans don't want to see this.

36:30.710 --> 36:33.170
They want the hausfrau
from Queens.

36:33.210 --> 36:35.790
Ooh. Macaroons.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.210
(laughs) You are so refreshing.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.760
-Hmm?
-Eating a macaroon like that.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.430
Oh, am I eating it wrong?

36:43.470 --> 36:45.600
No, no, no.
You're eating it.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.220
(Sophie chuckles)

36:47.260 --> 36:49.560
Leave the wedge, please.

37:02.570 --> 37:05.110
My goodness, you're so pretty.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.910
Why comedy? Can't you sing?

37:07.950 --> 37:11.200
Nope. The comedy thing...
I-I just fell into it.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.710
Mm, me, too.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.750
-I went to Yale Drama School.
-You're kidding.

37:14.790 --> 37:17.210
Yes, I wanted
to be the next Laurette Taylor.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.250
Then I graduated, and I starved,

37:19.300 --> 37:22.760
so I started doing this
character... Sophie from Queens.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.760
And look what it paid for.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.220
Dawes?

37:26.260 --> 37:29.220
-Yes, ma'am?
-Isn't that marvelous?

37:29.260 --> 37:32.730
-Uh...
-So tell me...

37:32.770 --> 37:35.140
what is your gimmick?

37:35.190 --> 37:37.440
-My...?
-Your persona.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.070
-Your Sophie.
-Oh.

37:39.110 --> 37:41.610
I don't have a persona.
I'm just me.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.200
Oh, no, no, no,
that will not work.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.530
-It won't?
-No. No one wants that.

37:46.570 --> 37:48.030
I-I've been doing okay.

37:48.070 --> 37:49.620
Downtown.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.870
Honey, you give a downtowner
a swig of gin,

37:51.910 --> 37:53.960
and he'll laugh at a sponge.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.870
The mainstreamers,
the people from Pacoima,

37:56.920 --> 38:00.460
the people who buy the dish soap
and the dog food,

38:00.500 --> 38:05.380
who pay for the Modigliani's...
they want a character.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.680
But... Bob Hope
doesn't have a character.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.510
Lenny Bruce doesn't have
a character.

38:09.550 --> 38:12.310
They have dicks.
Do you have a dick?

38:12.350 --> 38:14.100
Not last time I checked.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.480
Darling, look at you.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.440
I mean, really...
men don't want to laugh at you.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.980
They want to fuck you.

38:21.020 --> 38:23.030
You can't go up there
and be a woman.

38:23.070 --> 38:24.940
You've got to be a thing.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.490
You want to get ahead
in comedy?

38:26.530 --> 38:28.660
Cover up that hole.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.870
Another macaroon, miss?

38:30.910 --> 38:32.450
No, thank you, Dawes.

38:32.490 --> 38:34.910
You're learning.

38:36.410 --> 38:40.000
So... you got the grand tour?

38:40.040 --> 38:41.880
My feet hurt, we walked so much.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.630
(laughs)
I love that you love kitchens.

38:43.670 --> 38:45.300
-I do.
-Mm.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.430
You should visit yours sometime.
It misses you.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.300
Oh, and you have macaroons
to take home.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.720
This was very nice.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.720
-Mm.
-Thank you, Sophie.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.770
I have a feeling
we're going to be seeing a lot

38:54.810 --> 38:56.180
of each other in the future.

38:56.230 --> 38:57.730
I hope so.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.690
Well, good luck tomorrow night.

38:59.730 --> 39:01.900
Say hello to Harry
and make him laugh.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.570
-I will do my best.
-Mm.

39:03.610 --> 39:05.070
Your coat, miss.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.990
What is that?

39:07.030 --> 39:08.610
That is my coat.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.950
That flimsy thing?
It's freezing out.

39:10.990 --> 39:14.200
Uh-uh. Jenkins?

39:14.240 --> 39:17.750
A fat suit is very warm,
by the way.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.710
This was really not necessary.

39:24.750 --> 39:27.170
Miss Lennon was unhappy
with your coat.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.420
How should I get it back to her?

39:28.470 --> 39:30.340
She's worn it twice.
It's yours now.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.010
Do you need a car?

39:32.050 --> 39:34.260
No. Thank you, Dawes.

39:34.310 --> 39:36.350
This has been a gas.

39:36.390 --> 39:38.980
It has, miss. Good-bye.

39:50.660 --> 39:53.030
(singing in Hebrew)

40:06.710 --> 40:09.260
-Goot Shabbos, Abraham.
-Goot Shabbos, Chaim.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.800
Where are the ladies?

40:10.840 --> 40:12.760
A very good question, Chaim.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
(singing continues)

40:14.850 --> 40:17.010
Abraham...

40:17.060 --> 40:19.600
come close, please!

40:21.270 --> 40:23.650
The rabbi has a cold.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.440
Thank you, Chaim.

40:30.780 --> 40:33.160
(singing ends)

40:38.660 --> 40:42.420
Everyone please join me
as we welcome the Sabbath

40:42.460 --> 40:48.250

Where were you?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.940
You're going to answer
my question with a question?

41:03.980 --> 41:07.480

-What?

41:16.490 --> 41:18.370
That. What are you wearing?

41:18.410 --> 41:19.740
Oh, just...

41:19.790 --> 41:21.370
Long story.
What page are we on?

41:21.410 --> 41:23.750
-137.
-Well, tell me the story.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.710
-What? -Tell me the story.
I want to know.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.290
I borrowed it, okay?
I borrowed the coat.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.170
-Let's talk after.
-No. Let's talk now.

41:30.210 --> 41:31.710
Mama, shh.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.840
Don't "shh" me!
Don't you ever "shh" me!

41:33.880 --> 41:35.890
-Tell me where you got
the fur coat! -Rose.

41:35.930 --> 41:37.970
-Mama!
-What? Marshall Field?

41:38.010 --> 41:40.180
The label says "Marshall Field."
That's in Chicago.

41:40.220 --> 41:41.720
-When were you in Chicago?
-Shh!

41:41.770 --> 41:43.270
-What about Marshall Field?
-Not now, Chaim.

41:43.310 --> 41:44.770
Why do you have a fur coat?

41:44.810 --> 41:46.190
Really, we are ruining
"Lecha Dodi."

41:46.230 --> 41:47.770
Well, I think I deserve

41:47.810 --> 41:49.730
to know some fucking thing,
don't I, Miriam?

41:49.770 --> 41:52.150
I mean, don't I deserve
to know anything?

41:52.190 --> 41:53.900
Rose, look where we are.

41:53.950 --> 41:56.160
I mean, I clearly, didn't
deserve to know that Abe knew

41:56.200 --> 41:57.620
that your husband
came back, right?

41:57.660 --> 41:59.450
I clearly didn't deserve
to know that the thing

41:59.490 --> 42:01.160
I'd been waiting for
all these months,

42:01.200 --> 42:03.500
the reconciliation
of Ethan's mother and father...

42:03.540 --> 42:05.960
I-I-I, what, didn't deserve
to know that that happened.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.500
Okay, fine! I get that!
That's life, but the least

42:08.540 --> 42:10.130
you can do, Miriam, is tell me

42:10.170 --> 42:11.750
where you got
the Goddamn fur coat!

42:42.990 --> 42:45.370
How you doing, Harry?
Can I get you anything?

42:45.410 --> 42:47.210
Some ventilation would be nice.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.500
I know you're anxious
to get the show started

42:49.540 --> 42:51.340
before your stool softener
kicks in.

42:51.380 --> 42:54.090
Appreciated. You know, there's
a lot of energy in this room.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.550
It's impressive.

42:55.590 --> 42:57.470
We were turning people
away out there.

42:57.510 --> 42:59.550
Thanks for this, Harry.
Really.

42:59.590 --> 43:02.310
-I'm gonna go check on my girl.
-Go. Be a manager.

43:02.350 --> 43:04.350
Hey, Jerry.

43:04.390 --> 43:06.100
-Where's Midge?
-She's in the men's.

43:06.140 --> 43:08.560
What is she doing in the men's?

43:10.650 --> 43:13.270
-Occupied!
-SUSIE: It's me!

43:13.320 --> 43:14.690
Come on in.

43:14.730 --> 43:16.570
What are you doing
in the men's room?

43:16.610 --> 43:18.320
Getting ready.
The women's room was disgusting.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.160
Jackie, how disgusting
is the women's room

43:20.200 --> 43:21.870
that the men's room
is less disgusting?

43:21.910 --> 43:23.950
I don't know.
I don't go in the women's room.

43:23.990 --> 43:25.580
Must be foul, though.

43:25.620 --> 43:27.870
You ready?
Crowd is clamoring.

43:27.910 --> 43:30.330
I am ready.

43:30.370 --> 43:32.380
So I was thinking
you should go back to starting

43:32.420 --> 43:33.960
with the stuff
about your parents first.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.590
Then go to your work stuff...
like you used to.

43:35.630 --> 43:37.590
-I was thinking the same thing.
-Mm. Simpatico.

43:37.630 --> 43:39.180
MIDGE:
So simpatico.

43:39.220 --> 43:40.930
Jackie, do your thing.

43:40.970 --> 43:43.510
Okay, I'm going back with Harry.
Break a leg.

43:43.550 --> 43:45.140
You ready, Amanda?

43:45.180 --> 43:47.390
Amanda is ready.

43:47.430 --> 43:49.770
(applause and cheering)

43:49.810 --> 43:51.850
JACKIE:
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:51.900 --> 43:54.360
Don't applaud me. I'm nobody.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.110
Applaud the young lady
coming up.

43:56.150 --> 43:57.940
She has been killing it
these past few weeks

43:57.990 --> 43:59.900
right here at the Gaslight.

43:59.950 --> 44:02.910
And tonight, you are witnessing
a very special showcase.

44:02.950 --> 44:06.870
So give it up for our own
homegrown girl: Amanda Gleason!

44:06.910 --> 44:08.700
(applause and cheering)

44:08.750 --> 44:11.670
Okay, okay.

44:11.710 --> 44:13.830
Guess the checks I wrote
to all of you have cleared.

44:13.880 --> 44:15.290
Good to know.

44:15.340 --> 44:18.010
Stop it. Stop it.

44:18.050 --> 44:19.720
Oh, stop.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.640
-She glows, this girl.
-That she does.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.470
You ever think
about your parents having sex?

44:25.510 --> 44:27.430
(laughter)

44:27.470 --> 44:29.770
Yeah. Yeah, even Freud is like,

44:29.810 --> 44:31.640
"You know what?
I'm gonna pass on that one."

44:31.690 --> 44:33.600
But I was at my parents' house

44:33.650 --> 44:37.440
one morning recently,
and I heard this sound.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.650
(light laughter)

44:46.830 --> 44:48.870
This scraping noise.

44:48.910 --> 44:52.160
So I went into their bedroom,
and there were my parents,

44:52.210 --> 44:55.330
struggling
to separate the twin beds.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.710
(laughter)

45:02.550 --> 45:05.300
You know, I'm gonna give my
parents' sex life a night off.

45:05.340 --> 45:08.430
I'm gonna give my mother
a night off... from me,

45:08.470 --> 45:10.220
-from my mind.
-(laughter)

45:10.270 --> 45:12.100
Wouldn't that be nice?
What do you say?

45:12.140 --> 45:15.100
-Yeah, what do you think?
-(applause and cheering)

45:15.150 --> 45:18.820
No. I-I... I love my mother,
I really do.

45:18.860 --> 45:22.570
I just, I wish that sometimes
she would just... relax,

45:22.610 --> 45:24.700
not worry about things.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.200
I-I mean, it's not her fault.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.740
She just wants everything
to be perfect.

45:28.780 --> 45:32.410
No, no, she wants everything
to seem perfect,

45:32.460 --> 45:34.960
to look perfect.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.630
She's like a Jewish Dorian Gray.

45:38.670 --> 45:42.510
-(laughter)
-She's so focused on me,

45:42.550 --> 45:45.470
and I don't understand it,
because so what if I work?

45:45.510 --> 45:47.930
So what if I get divorced?

45:47.970 --> 45:49.930
So what if I'm alone?

45:49.970 --> 45:55.020
Why do women care about how
people look at them or see them?

45:55.060 --> 45:56.770
All women.

45:56.810 --> 45:59.230
Beautiful women,
successful women.

45:59.270 --> 46:01.110
WOMAN:
Yeah.

46:01.150 --> 46:02.780
Do you know Sophie Lennon?

46:02.820 --> 46:05.110
-(applause and cheering)
-MIDGE: Sure.

46:05.150 --> 46:06.660
Sure, yeah, everyone does.

46:06.700 --> 46:09.740
Queen of vaudeville,
conquered radio.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.580
She is a comedy icon.

46:11.620 --> 46:13.250
But you know what?

46:13.290 --> 46:16.080
You don't know
the great Sophie Lennon.

46:16.120 --> 46:17.630
This is part of her act?

46:17.670 --> 46:19.080
She's a little off book here.

46:19.130 --> 46:20.920
MIDGE:
I got to go to her house.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.380
-Sidebar... it's not in Queens!
-(laughter)

46:23.420 --> 46:25.170
In fact,
calling that thing a house

46:25.220 --> 46:27.050
is like calling
the Vatican a church.

46:27.090 --> 46:29.010
(laughter)

46:29.050 --> 46:31.930
I mean, this woman drips wealth,
you know?

46:31.970 --> 46:34.020
Like, if she had been around
during the Russian Revolution,

46:34.060 --> 46:37.190
the Bolsheviks would've told
the Romanovs, "Ah, never mind.

46:37.230 --> 46:38.650
"Take your diamonds,
take your crowns.

46:38.690 --> 46:40.360
We got Sophie Lennon.
That'll do us."

46:40.400 --> 46:43.150
-(laughter)
-And her poor staff.

46:43.190 --> 46:45.570
I have a feeling
that when company leaves,

46:45.610 --> 46:48.280
that's when her butlers
and maids do their real jobs...

46:48.320 --> 46:50.450
polishing her silver
and her ego.

46:50.490 --> 46:51.910
(laughter)

46:51.950 --> 46:55.290
-What the fuck?
-Fat Sophie Lennon.

46:55.330 --> 46:57.710
Right?
"Put that on your plate!"

46:57.750 --> 46:59.380
(laughter)

46:59.420 --> 47:02.750
Well, guess what?
It's a fucking fat suit.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.550
-WOMAN: What?
-(audience gasping)

47:04.590 --> 47:06.670
And there is nothing
on her plate.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.220
I ate with her.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.430
All she did was suck a lemon
down to the rind,

47:10.470 --> 47:13.720
and when I had the audacity
to take a bite of a cookie,

47:13.760 --> 47:15.810
she made me feel like
I'd splashed her

47:15.850 --> 47:17.230
with a cup of syphilis.

47:17.270 --> 47:19.650
(laughter, scattered applause)

47:19.690 --> 47:21.860
You know, she gave me
a piece of advice

47:21.900 --> 47:24.480
right there in the Blue Room.

47:24.530 --> 47:28.110
She told me
that no one would find me funny

47:28.150 --> 47:31.530
unless I do some big,
whackadoodle character,

47:31.570 --> 47:33.200
or have a dick.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.330
-(laughter)
"Sophie Lennon!"

47:35.370 --> 47:39.330
Really? You're gonna sit in
your million-dollar townhouse,

47:39.370 --> 47:41.380
on some chair that's historical

47:41.420 --> 47:43.420
because the Mad King George
got the trots on it,

47:43.460 --> 47:45.500
and tell me
that men won't think I'm funny

47:45.550 --> 47:47.720
because I don't look like
a dump truck?

47:47.760 --> 47:49.590
(laughter)

47:49.630 --> 47:52.340
Why do women have to pretend to
be something that they're not?

47:52.390 --> 47:54.140
-WOMAN: Right.
-(whistling)

47:54.180 --> 47:57.020
Why do we have to pretend to be
stupid when we're not stupid?

47:57.060 --> 47:59.100
-WOMAN: Yeah!
-Why do we have to pretend

47:59.140 --> 48:02.400
-to be helpless when we're not
helpless? -(whoops, applause)

48:02.440 --> 48:04.570
Why do we have
to pretend to be sorry

48:04.610 --> 48:06.610
when we have nothing
to be sorry about?

48:06.650 --> 48:08.490
-WOMAN: Amen! -WOMAN 2: Right!
-(applause and cheering)

48:08.530 --> 48:11.570
Why do we have to pretend we're
not hungry when we're hungry?

48:11.610 --> 48:13.160
(cheering)

48:13.200 --> 48:16.700
Fuck you, Sophie!
Put that on your plate!

48:16.740 --> 48:19.120
-(applause, cheering, whistling)
-(indistinct shout)

48:19.160 --> 48:22.250
Harry, wait.

48:22.290 --> 48:24.630
-Harry!
-MIDGE: Let them not eat cake.

48:24.670 --> 48:26.590
Please.

48:26.630 --> 48:28.340
Harry, wait. Let me explain.

48:28.380 --> 48:30.170
You're dead in this business.
You hear me?

48:30.220 --> 48:32.340
You double-cross me,
you don't come back.

48:32.380 --> 48:34.260
I told you
she was spontaneous.

48:34.300 --> 48:36.760
Do you have any idea what
it means to be on my bad side?

48:36.810 --> 48:38.970
-I don't want to be
on your bad side. -This town

48:39.020 --> 48:40.890
is gonna become
a very uncomfortable place

48:40.930 --> 48:42.310
for you two, Susie.

48:42.350 --> 48:44.360
Fucking count on it.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.820
MIDGE:
...Sophie and my mother.

48:46.860 --> 48:49.650
Now there's a pair.

48:49.690 --> 48:51.530
Let's get those two together.

48:51.570 --> 48:54.700
Maybe my mother will move into
Sophie's unoccupied kitchen

48:54.740 --> 48:58.080
and together they can eat
lemon wedges for eternity!

48:58.120 --> 48:59.830
(applause and cheering)

48:59.870 --> 49:04.460
As long as the lemons are
the best lemons in the world.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.920
Oh, I'm just
getting started here.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.630
You don't have anywhere to go,
do you, guys?
