WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:03.869
Nick...

00:03.937 --> 00:05.137
I think I'm in love.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.339
Nice. What's his name,

00:07.408 --> 00:10.042
and what high school did he drop out of?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.678
What? No, I'm in love with a dog.

00:12.747 --> 00:16.015
I saw him at the animal
shelter my weed guy works at.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.450
(chuckles): Dude, he is so cute.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.818
The dog.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.255
Nick, can I adopt him?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.957
Please? Please, please, please, please?

00:25.026 --> 00:27.059
I promise I'll take
such good care of him.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.661
Okay, this is literally the
easiest decision I've ever made.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.864
(laughs): Thank you so much, Nick.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.900
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna regret this.

00:34.969 --> 00:38.504
Thought it was very clear that I meant,
uh, no. (chuckles)

00:38.572 --> 00:42.241
- What?
- Look, a dog is a huge commitment,

00:42.309 --> 00:43.442
and your sister and I
are gonna be the ones

00:43.511 --> 00:44.589
that have to take care of it.

00:44.646 --> 00:47.880
And let's be honest,
you're way too irresponsible.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.748
(scoffs) Okay, Nick.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.084
Name one thing I've done
that's irresponsible.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.421
- Uh, last...
- That specifically relates to dogs.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.290
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.558
How'd the dress fitting go?

00:59.627 --> 01:01.460
- Well...
- It was magical.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.897
Clem, you will never know
how much it means to me

01:04.965 --> 01:07.766
that you will be
wearing my wedding gown.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.101
I always thought it was impossible

01:09.170 --> 01:11.003
for someone to look
better in it than I did.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.372
But you came close.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.773
SHANNON: Oh.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.276
Good news, Clem. We're getting a dog.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.379
Wheels are in motion, can't be stopped.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.381
I already named him Pretzel.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.884
I assume you already shut this down?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.519
Shut it down like a RadioShack.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.091
Clem, you know,
this is a dream come true for me.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.126
You know, never having
a daughter of my own,

01:34.195 --> 01:36.361
I thought I wouldn't get
to pass down my dress.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.630
But now I have a daughter.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.032
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.135
So I guess that makes you
guys brother and sister?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.404
Okay, I just need to know,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.573
do you <i> love</i> the dress?

01:47.641 --> 01:50.742
I mean, do you really, <i>really</i> love it?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.511
- I <i> love</i> it.
- Oh!

01:52.613 --> 01:54.046
And I love that you love it.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.314
Well, I got to go.

01:55.382 --> 01:58.016
- Good-bye, darlings.
- Bye.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.586
Oh, that is so great that you love it.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.321
I hate it!

02:02.389 --> 02:03.655
I mean,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.791
I mean, it is beautiful,
but it's just not me.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.960
It's old-fashioned, and it's matronly,

02:08.027 --> 02:10.929
and there's just...
there's a lot of poof.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.602
Babe, you're beautiful.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.170
You can make any dress work.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.372
Thank you. And I have no choice.

02:20.441 --> 02:24.076
If I don't walk down the aisle
in that taffeta hazmat suit,

02:24.145 --> 02:25.811
your mom is gonna be devastated.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.212
Don't worry, Clem.

02:27.281 --> 02:30.182
You know what would make you
feel a lot better right now?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.551
A dog.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.554
♪ ♪

02:40.628 --> 02:43.362
Give it to me. Give it to me straight.

02:43.430 --> 02:47.099
Oh, honey, I haven't given it to
anyone straight since prom '05.

02:47.841 --> 02:49.535
But for real,

02:49.603 --> 02:52.838
- you look so beautiful.
- Aw.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.273
...is what I would say
if you weren't wearing

02:54.341 --> 02:55.641
a curtain-sized doily.

02:57.037 --> 02:59.645
And the worst part is when
we were at the fitting,

02:59.713 --> 03:02.181
I saw this perfect Vera Wang dress.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.118
Ben, I really want that Wang.

03:06.665 --> 03:09.288
Girl, I get it. I love the wang, too.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.658
Well...

03:12.726 --> 03:14.226
- this is a disaster.
- Okay.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.427
I know how to cheer you up.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.828
You are coming out with me this Friday.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.263
The <i> Queer Eye</i> guys are throwing a party,

03:18.332 --> 03:19.475
and I'm gonna pretend to be straight

03:19.490 --> 03:21.907
so that they give me a makeover.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.242
Nick and I have a date night planned.

03:23.327 --> 03:25.244
We're gonna walk over
the Brooklyn Bridge

03:25.296 --> 03:27.212
and go to this great little bistro.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.466
We never hang out anymore, Clem.
I really miss my wingwoman.

03:30.551 --> 03:32.635
What are you talking about?
We hang out all the time.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.420
Not like we used to. Remember?

03:34.472 --> 03:36.672
You'd attract a crowd of straight guys,

03:36.757 --> 03:38.173
and I'd pick off the one
that was just pretending

03:38.259 --> 03:40.676
- for his father.
- (sighs)

03:40.761 --> 03:43.262
Yeah, and I'd grab the
one with emotional damage

03:43.347 --> 03:45.375
and date him until he decided
he was better than me.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.475
Mmm.

03:46.734 --> 03:48.684
God, we had fun.

03:48.769 --> 03:52.438
Anyway, I got to get out of this thing

03:52.700 --> 03:55.567
before somebody tries
to roast me over a fire.

03:59.069 --> 04:00.806
- Hey, Nicky.
- Hey, Ben.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.441
So, what boring couple thing

04:02.509 --> 04:04.443
are you forcing my Clemmy to do tonight?

04:04.511 --> 04:07.112
Boring? Hardly.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.948
Normally on Monday nights,
we, uh, drink some wine,

04:10.017 --> 04:12.985
watch an episode of
<i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

04:13.367 --> 04:16.387
But last week we fell asleep,
which means that this week,

04:16.457 --> 04:19.558
we get two episodes! Uh, what? (laughs)

04:19.627 --> 04:23.695
How <i> will</i> you keep this flame
alive after the wedding?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.798
Anyway, I'm headed out.
Have a cycle class to teach.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.800
Oh, yeah? You know,
I've been looking for a new workout.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.068
Maybe I'll stop by sometime.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.403
Oh, it's an advanced class.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.572
You might want to try Ira on Thursdays.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.641
You don't think I can handle yours?

04:35.709 --> 04:39.344
Right. That's why I said
try Ira on Thursdays.

04:40.219 --> 04:41.913
Okay, I need help.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.916
This thing is like the
world's poofiest prison.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.084
Hey, babe. Oh!

04:46.153 --> 04:48.820
Aah! I should not see you in the dress.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.922
To be fair, no one should.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.491
CLEM: Come on, Nick.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.192
<i>That</i> old superstition?

04:54.261 --> 04:55.594
Yes, Clem. It's bad luck

04:55.663 --> 04:58.063
to see the bride in her
dress before the wedding.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.699
Okay? Look, it's like some
sort of curse or something.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.235
- Ben, tell her.
- Yeah. I'm sorry to tell you Nick's right.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.570
You are now doomed to a
lifetime of nights on the couch

05:05.639 --> 05:07.439
with bad television and worse wine.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.442
It's a Trader Joe's pick of the week.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.784
Man, things are getting
hot on that beach, huh?

05:18.852 --> 05:21.320
I mean, I just knew
he was gonna choose Becca P.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.690
And then, boom, out of nowhere, Becca C.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.360
Without even considering poor Becca R.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.963
Babe, for what it's worth,

05:32.032 --> 05:33.799
- you look beautiful in that dress.
- Aw.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.401
So I brought you a little
juice from the vine

05:36.470 --> 05:39.638
- to ease your mind.
- Aw.

05:40.243 --> 05:41.840
I can't wait to marry you.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.342
To us.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.810
Yes. (chuckles)

05:44.878 --> 05:48.246
- (gasps, screams)
- Oh! Oh!

05:48.965 --> 05:50.669
- What did you do?
- Me?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.751
- Yes.
- You just flung wine all over my mom's dress.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.152
I didn't do anything.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.420
You were supposed to meet me halfway.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.755
That's how a toast works.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.597
- You don't just drink. You clink first!
- You don't always clink first.

05:59.697 --> 06:01.360
Everybody clinks first.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.996
Oh, my God. The curse.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.631
There is no curse. There's a stain,

06:06.700 --> 06:07.999
and it is setting.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.569
Come on. Quick, the kitchen sink.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.005
Quick. I'll get the stain remover.
Go, go, go!

06:14.765 --> 06:16.208
I got the stain remover!

06:16.276 --> 06:18.276
Babe, turn on the other light.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.778
- (garbage disposal grinding)
- Oh, no!

06:19.847 --> 06:22.214
No! No.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.582
(grinding stops)

06:24.514 --> 06:26.618
I don't think that was the light, Clem.

06:27.557 --> 06:29.554
Maybe it's okay. Maybe it's okay.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.057
(grunts)

06:32.126 --> 06:33.558
Okay.

06:33.627 --> 06:37.062
So it's not okay.

06:37.131 --> 06:40.098
I see you had my leftover pad thai.

06:44.647 --> 06:46.614
- What's up, Clem?
- I'll tell you what's up.

06:46.682 --> 06:47.915
I did something bad. I did something,

06:47.984 --> 06:50.351
like, really, really,
really, really, really bad.

06:50.419 --> 06:53.521
You know, that sounds
like something I usually say.

06:53.589 --> 06:56.791
Hold up, did we just <i> Freaky Friday?</i>

06:58.594 --> 07:01.595
Shannon, I ruined Rose's wedding dress.

07:01.664 --> 07:03.364
She's gonna be heartbroken.

07:03.432 --> 07:05.332
Okay, Clem, I'm sure it's not that bad.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.235
(whispers): Damn.

07:09.639 --> 07:12.273
You murdered that thing. Oh, my...

07:12.341 --> 07:14.642
I can't believe that this happened.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.777
You know what's comforting
in times of stress?

07:16.846 --> 07:19.780
- Please don't say a puppy.
- A puppy.

07:19.849 --> 07:20.981
(Nick cries out)

07:24.287 --> 07:26.020
(grunting)

07:28.291 --> 07:30.524
Wow. I guess now we've
both seen each other

07:30.593 --> 07:33.861
in outfits that we wish we could unsee.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.563
I'm actually heading to Ben's...

07:36.666 --> 07:38.766
...cycle class.

07:38.835 --> 07:41.435
He said he didn't think I could
handle it. Can you believe that?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.893
I mean, your boy
ran a half marathon last year.

07:43.973 --> 07:45.539
Yeah, but not on purpose.

07:45.608 --> 07:46.974
Your boy signed up for a full one

07:47.043 --> 07:49.610
and then stopped halfway
at a Pancake City.

07:49.679 --> 07:52.213
To carbo-load.

07:53.883 --> 07:55.349
Hey, babe, you sure you don't want me

07:55.418 --> 07:56.757
to come with you to tell
my mom about the dress?

07:56.820 --> 08:00.387
No. I got this.
But if I don't make it back alive,

08:00.456 --> 08:02.089
it's gonna be a real bummer

08:02.158 --> 08:04.758
that this was my last image of you.

08:05.862 --> 08:07.228
Thank you.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.067
Okay.

08:13.135 --> 08:15.436
Enough stalling. Here I go.

08:15.504 --> 08:19.173
(groaning): Oh, my God.
How am I gonna do this?

08:19.242 --> 08:22.676
Listen, Clem,
you're talking to the expert here.

08:24.180 --> 08:25.512
If you've ever done something

08:25.581 --> 08:27.548
that's gonna completely
crush and devastate someone,

08:27.617 --> 08:28.983
say it with a smile.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.217
All right, we got options here.

08:30.286 --> 08:31.852
There's the "I'm innocent" smile.

08:31.921 --> 08:33.486
The "I don't know" smile.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.023
Now, the really great one is the
"I don't really care" smile.

08:36.092 --> 08:37.825
The beauty of this one...

08:38.717 --> 08:40.660
I want you to picture your best self

08:40.730 --> 08:42.996
and cycle to her, you bitches.

08:43.951 --> 08:45.833
Nick. How you doing, buddy?

08:45.902 --> 08:47.368
Hope you don't think I'm
gonna go easy on you.

08:47.436 --> 08:49.370
There is no special
treatment in the Ben-Den.

08:49.438 --> 08:52.072
Don't need any special
treatment in the Ben-Den.

08:52.141 --> 08:54.041
I'm actually a little bored.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.743
When are we done with this warm-up?

08:55.811 --> 08:57.645
- Couple minutes.
- What!?

08:58.649 --> 08:59.713
This is still the warm-up?

08:59.782 --> 09:01.582
You got to be joking.

09:01.651 --> 09:03.717
Everyone, I need you
to kick it up a notch!

09:03.786 --> 09:04.852
(all whoop)

09:04.921 --> 09:07.054
Dig deep, Nicky,
like my girl Gertie here.

09:07.123 --> 09:09.757
And everyone wish Gertie
a happy 75th birthday!

09:09.825 --> 09:10.858
(all cheer)

09:11.375 --> 09:13.160
Damn, Gertie.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.562
Rose, there's something
I need to tell you,

09:18.569 --> 09:22.903
and it may be very upsetting.

09:25.841 --> 09:27.508
How do I say this?

09:27.576 --> 09:28.909
ROSE: What? What is it?

09:28.978 --> 09:31.812
Sweetheart, just tell me.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.881
Rose, your wedding dress is ruined.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.516
(gasps)

09:36.886 --> 09:38.052
- (Rose squeals)
- CLEM: No, no, no, no, no.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.420
Don't freak out. It's not that bad.

09:39.488 --> 09:41.422
- It's not?
- Oh, no, it is real bad.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.857
- I don't know why I just said that.
- (squeals)

09:44.617 --> 09:46.360
Rose, I'm so sorry.

09:46.429 --> 09:47.995
How'd it happen?

09:48.064 --> 09:50.097
Well, the-the thing is, um,

09:50.166 --> 09:52.266
- what happened was...
- Rose, I did it.

09:52.335 --> 09:53.901
I ruined your dress. It was me.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.869
What?

09:57.440 --> 10:01.041
Just FYI, I forgot to get more
milk earlier like you asked me to.

10:02.979 --> 10:04.812
I figured I'd sort of draft off

10:04.880 --> 10:07.781
this much bigger Shannon confession.

10:07.850 --> 10:09.450
Continue.

10:09.518 --> 10:11.452
Tell me exactly how it happened.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
Well, you know, normally, I make a list.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.157
But truth is, I got a little cocky.

10:18.928 --> 10:20.194
So, I was messing around,

10:20.262 --> 10:22.162
and I spilled red wine on the dress,

10:22.231 --> 10:23.397
- and then...
- Red wine?

10:23.466 --> 10:25.632
Red wine around a wedding gown?

10:25.701 --> 10:27.768
Oh, God, that is so careless.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.470
Careless!

10:29.538 --> 10:33.607
And then, in an extremely
unfortunate turn of events,

10:33.676 --> 10:36.076
I tried to wash it in the sink,

10:36.145 --> 10:38.579
and I ended up shredding it
in... in the...

10:38.647 --> 10:40.581
in the garbage disposal.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.074

10:52.065 --> 10:54.561
Well, I guess that dream is over.

10:54.630 --> 10:58.799
The dream of seeing Clem
married in my wedding gown.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.434
I'm sorry, Rose.

11:00.503 --> 11:02.302
Rose, I feel terrible.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.338
Oh. Me, too, Clem. Me, too.

11:04.407 --> 11:06.407
Hmm.

11:08.511 --> 11:10.544
I also forgot the Wheat Thins.
I'm sorry.

11:12.882 --> 11:15.149
That was really hard.

11:16.001 --> 11:18.426
Shannon, you totally threw
yourself on the grenade for me.

11:18.461 --> 11:19.520
Why'd you do that?

11:19.588 --> 11:21.655
Dude, I'm used to people
being disappointed in me.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.820
I can handle it.
And I know how important

11:23.826 --> 11:26.193
your relationship with Rose
is to you, so...

11:26.262 --> 11:31.331
Oh. Shannon,
sometimes you really surprise me.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.234
Aw. And for my cooperation,

11:35.102 --> 11:36.470
I want that puppy.

11:39.108 --> 11:41.642
- And other times, you're a little on the nose.
- Mm.

11:44.734 --> 11:47.047
Oh, my God, I love this dog so much!

11:47.116 --> 11:48.282
I love you. I love you.

11:48.350 --> 11:50.684
I love you, I love you. I <i> love</i> you.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.519
And I love you. And you thought

11:52.588 --> 11:54.555
I wasn't gonna be able
to take care of him.

11:54.623 --> 11:57.991
You've literally had him for two hours.

11:58.060 --> 12:01.228
Yeah, but that's, like,
way longer in dog hours.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.300
(groans)

12:06.368 --> 12:09.036
- Oh. (sucks air through teeth)
- Wow.

12:09.105 --> 12:10.404
You see that, Pretzel?

12:10.473 --> 12:14.842
That's the result of 30
minutes of light exercise.

12:14.910 --> 12:18.078
Top athletes, like your boy right here,

12:18.147 --> 12:19.680
call it "the recovery waddle."

12:19.748 --> 12:22.082
That's right. If you ain't waddling,
you ain't throttling.

12:22.151 --> 12:24.084
Here we go!<i> Aah.</i>

12:27.333 --> 12:29.256
I just got off the phone with
the guy from the bridal shop.

12:29.325 --> 12:30.424
And guess what.

12:30.493 --> 12:33.994
He's giving me the Wang of my dreams.

12:34.063 --> 12:36.196
And this is how you tell me?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.066
(barks)

12:40.903 --> 12:42.503
CLEM: Um, Shannon,

12:42.571 --> 12:44.404
I think Pretzel here needs to go out.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.908
Nah, he's just holding the
door shut to protect us.

12:49.845 --> 12:53.046
Fine. I'll go get his leash,

12:53.115 --> 12:54.948
'cause I'm responsible.

12:55.017 --> 12:57.384
Come on, Pretzel. Let's go.

12:57.453 --> 12:59.505
Look, Clem,
I get why you didn't want to tell my mom

12:59.589 --> 13:00.888
about what happened with the dress,

13:00.956 --> 13:02.956
but now, we're stuck with a creature

13:03.025 --> 13:05.692
that's barely housebroken and
can't take care of itself.

13:05.761 --> 13:08.061
And on top of all of that,
we have a dog.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.998
I know. I do kind of feel
bad about lying to your mom,

13:11.066 --> 13:12.833
but think about it. It all worked out.

13:12.902 --> 13:14.468
I'm all good with Rose.

13:14.537 --> 13:16.748
I get to wear the dress that
I really wanted to wear.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.773
And Shannon gets to learn
about responsibility.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.976
What happened to your curse, hmm?

13:23.045 --> 13:25.612
(knocking at door)

13:25.681 --> 13:27.114
Hey, Walt. What's up?

13:27.183 --> 13:30.450
Good news. I was able to pull
some strings, call in a favor,

13:30.519 --> 13:32.853
and I got a costume
designer friend to...

13:32.922 --> 13:34.855
repair Rose's wedding dress!

13:34.924 --> 13:35.956
No!

13:38.060 --> 13:39.860
Way!

13:39.929 --> 13:42.296
No way. That's... that's awesome.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.530
(laughs)

13:43.599 --> 13:45.632
(Clem fake laughs)

13:45.701 --> 13:48.635
Holy crap, you can't kill that thing.

13:52.255 --> 13:53.893
Walt, I can't believe it.

13:53.976 --> 13:56.943
The dress looks exactly
the same as before.

13:57.012 --> 13:58.645
Doesn't it, Clem?

13:58.713 --> 14:03.616
Yeah, although, is it just me,
or did they add even more poof?

14:04.401 --> 14:05.618
Good eye.

14:05.687 --> 14:06.953
I had 'em do that.

14:07.022 --> 14:09.722
You got to keep up with the times.

14:09.791 --> 14:11.291
Dad, how'd you get that done so fast?

14:11.326 --> 14:14.894
Oh, it wasn't easy. The costume
designer is an aspiring playwright,

14:14.963 --> 14:17.497
so I had to promise to
star in a two-week run

14:17.566 --> 14:21.434
of her show about menopause,
called <i> Is It Hot in Here?</i>

14:23.171 --> 14:25.104
Well, I got to bounce.

14:25.173 --> 14:27.240
I'm meeting some friends to study.

14:27.309 --> 14:28.875
That sounds a lot like you.

14:28.944 --> 14:30.643
What are you guys studying?

14:30.712 --> 14:33.980
Physics. Is that a thing?

14:34.049 --> 14:37.250
Don't you think you should
stop by the apartment first

14:37.319 --> 14:39.018
and let your dog out?

14:39.087 --> 14:42.322
Man, I should have gotten one of
those dogs that pees in a box.

14:42.390 --> 14:44.791
That's called a cat.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.627
(door closes)

14:47.696 --> 14:49.929
I can't believe you let her have a dog.

14:49.998 --> 14:52.832
And after what she did to <i> our</i> dress. Mm.

14:52.901 --> 14:55.435
Well, it <i> was</i> an accident.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.370
Maybe. Maybe not.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.105
You never know with Shannon.

14:59.174 --> 15:00.251
You know, Clem, I have done

15:00.275 --> 15:03.876
everything I could to welcome
your family into our family.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.245
And I know Shannon's had
a difficult upbringing,

15:06.314 --> 15:07.647
but so have you,

15:07.716 --> 15:10.984
and I don't think you'd
ever do something like that.

15:11.052 --> 15:12.986
Ooh.

15:14.422 --> 15:15.955
And the hurtful part is,

15:16.024 --> 15:18.291
she doesn't even seem genuinely sorry.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.433
Oh, she's sorry.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.562
I know for a fact that she's,
like, really, really sorry.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.965
Like... on the verge of vomiting sorry.

15:26.576 --> 15:28.167
Clem, what's going on?

15:28.731 --> 15:30.870
Shannon didn't ruin the dress, Rose.

15:32.489 --> 15:33.673
I did.

15:34.228 --> 15:36.409
What?

15:36.478 --> 15:37.777
I ruined the dress, Rose.

15:37.846 --> 15:39.812
Shannon took the blame because...

15:39.881 --> 15:41.981
'cause she didn't want
you to be mad at me.

15:42.050 --> 15:43.716
WALT: Wow. That was

15:43.785 --> 15:46.185
actually very noble of Shannon.

15:46.254 --> 15:48.090
Then she blackmailed us for a puppy.

15:48.157 --> 15:50.757
That sounds right.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.358
But I don't understand.

15:52.427 --> 15:54.027
Why didn't you say something?

15:54.095 --> 15:56.095
Because you said I was
like a daughter to you,

15:56.164 --> 15:57.664
and that meant the world to me.

15:57.732 --> 16:00.199
And then I ruined the dress,
and I got scared

16:00.268 --> 16:02.502
that maybe you wouldn't feel
like that about me anymore.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.737
Oh, baby,

16:04.806 --> 16:08.241
you'll <i> always</i> be my daughter,

16:08.309 --> 16:10.076
even if you disappoint me.

16:10.145 --> 16:15.181
Walt's still my husband,
and he forgot the damn Wheat Thins.

16:17.018 --> 16:20.453
The good news is, despite this fiasco,

16:20.522 --> 16:24.023
you can still wear the gown
now that it's been repaired.

16:24.092 --> 16:27.060
(sing-songy):
And updated in the poof department.

16:27.713 --> 16:30.129
Oh, and going forward,

16:30.198 --> 16:32.965
I want you to know, in this family,

16:33.034 --> 16:35.301
you can always be honest with me.

16:35.370 --> 16:39.405
I don't care how difficult you
think it is for me to hear.

16:39.474 --> 16:42.075
Don't you <i> ever</i> hold back.

16:42.143 --> 16:43.576
- Rose?
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.645 --> 16:45.111
The dress...

16:52.348 --> 16:54.654
It's just a little old-fashioned.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.623
Ooh, hold back. <i>Hold... back.</i>

16:58.626 --> 17:00.526
I love what it symbolizes. I do.

17:00.595 --> 17:02.361
And I love you, but it's just...

17:02.430 --> 17:04.163
It's not me.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.465
Clem, you're the bride.

17:06.534 --> 17:08.134
It's your day.

17:08.203 --> 17:11.337
Sweetheart, you get to wear
whatever you want to wear.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.571
Do you mean it?

17:12.640 --> 17:13.973
I think so.

17:15.597 --> 17:18.010
So, she's not wearing the dress,

17:18.079 --> 17:20.813
but I'll be spending
two weeks in Detroit

17:20.882 --> 17:23.249
in the dead of winter
doing menopause theater.

17:24.886 --> 17:26.586
That'll be fun.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.400
It's dinner time, Pretzel.

17:33.388 --> 17:34.702
Again.

17:36.105 --> 17:37.838
I just don't see the point in this.

17:37.907 --> 17:39.647
I put food in the front,
it comes out the back.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.009
What do I get out of it?

17:42.078 --> 17:44.345
Love and companionship?

17:44.414 --> 17:47.648
Sure, but so much comes out the back.

17:47.717 --> 17:48.916
(knocking at door)

17:49.889 --> 17:51.852
Hey, guys.

17:51.921 --> 17:54.488
Who is this adorable confection?

17:54.557 --> 17:56.023
That's my dog Pretzel.

17:56.092 --> 17:57.992
Oh. Oh.

17:58.061 --> 18:01.028
His kisses are like butterfly wings!

18:02.665 --> 18:04.065
Missed you in class today, Nicky.

18:04.133 --> 18:08.703
Ah, yeah, yeah.
You know, today was my lifting day.

18:08.771 --> 18:12.573
As in lifting the aspirin
to your mouth, or...?

18:13.315 --> 18:15.810
Okay, fine, Ben.
Your class kicked my ass.

18:15.878 --> 18:20.681
I'm in so much pain, this morning,
I had to sit to pee.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.719
I kind of liked it.
It might be my new thing.

18:24.787 --> 18:29.623
Well, Clemmy, since Nicky here
clearly can't cross the bridgey,

18:29.692 --> 18:31.625
sounds like you're free to go
to the party with me tonight.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.627
Oh, no. I can't leave Nick like this.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.796
Aah!

18:35.865 --> 18:37.998
What? No. No.
I thought if he couldn't walk,

18:38.067 --> 18:39.300
you could go with me.

18:40.538 --> 18:42.236
Wait a minute.

18:42.305 --> 18:45.106
Did you know I was
gonna end up like this?

18:45.174 --> 18:47.608
Did you know he was
gonna end up like this?

18:47.677 --> 18:49.777
Okay, fine. The bike I put you on...

18:49.846 --> 18:51.712
it's way harder than the rest of 'em.

18:51.781 --> 18:53.314
We call it "Jaws."

18:53.383 --> 18:56.016
It's reserved for Ironmen,
Olympians and Beyoncé.

18:58.287 --> 19:01.389
Wait. So what you're saying is,

19:01.457 --> 19:04.091
I am an incredible athlete.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.527
You did, like, three stages
of the Tour de France.

19:06.596 --> 19:08.462
It's a miracle that you are standing up.

19:08.531 --> 19:12.166
Well, you know, that is your boy.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.201
(laughs)

19:15.772 --> 19:18.105
It hurts so bad.

19:19.475 --> 19:21.175
Ben, why would you do that to him?

19:21.244 --> 19:23.577
Because I miss us, Clem.

19:23.646 --> 19:24.779
Everything's changing.

19:24.847 --> 19:26.180
And seeing you in that dress...

19:26.249 --> 19:30.651
that burlap yurt of a dress...

19:30.720 --> 19:32.420
really drove that home.

19:32.488 --> 19:35.156
Ben, we will always be besties.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.657
Me getting married doesn't change that.

19:36.726 --> 19:38.692
It just changes some of
the things that we do.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.028
Like, maybe more walks to brunch,

19:41.097 --> 19:43.964
and less walks of shame.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.535
But I am happy for you guys,

19:47.603 --> 19:50.070
even if I have to find
another wingperson.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.074
You sound like you could use a buddy.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.813
Maybe a little wingpuppy, you know?

20:00.283 --> 20:01.515
Take him.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.818
I can't take your dog.

20:03.886 --> 20:05.820
You absolutely can.

20:06.552 --> 20:10.024
Look, I love him.
Just not ready for him.

20:10.092 --> 20:13.194
It turns out I am deeply irresponsible.

20:14.564 --> 20:16.497
It's no one's fault.
No one saw this coming.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.068
Anyways, he'd be happier with you.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.603
And I could still
visit him all the time.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.173
No, it's too crazy. I can't.

20:26.242 --> 20:27.708
We walked by the pier,

20:27.777 --> 20:30.511
and, like,
15 sailors stopped to pet him.

20:31.221 --> 20:32.313
They did?

20:32.381 --> 20:33.547
Mm-hmm.

20:35.036 --> 20:37.051
To pet <i> my</i> dog?

20:37.899 --> 20:39.386
Come on, little buddy.

20:39.455 --> 20:42.857
We got to get you a little sailor hat.

20:42.925 --> 20:44.592
He licked inside my mouth.
