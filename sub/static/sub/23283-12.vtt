- Not good.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.125
- What's not good?

00:16.166 --> 00:18.458
- The toppings. You loaded it

- She's never twirled

00:56.750 --> 00:58.208
her hair like that before.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.917
- Or smiled.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.792
- So, $32?

00:59.959 --> 01:03.792
- Forget it. It's on the house.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.750
- Okay, so for

06:19.750 --> 06:21.750
the first three hours we--

06:21.792 --> 06:24.542
- And I'm out.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.542
- Hey, look. There's Britt.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.542
Maybe we can get to the bottom

06:27.583 --> 06:29.083
of this whole

06:27.583 --> 06:29.083
house crush thing.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.875
- There is no house crush

06:29.125 --> 06:30.875
thing.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.250
- Then who's he smiling at with

06:30.917 --> 06:33.250
that dumb look on his face?

06:33.291 --> 06:35.333
- If it were Dawn,

06:33.291 --> 06:35.333
why wouldn't he just

06:35.375 --> 06:37.250
talk to her face-to-face?

06:35.375 --> 06:37.250
- Because then everyone

06:37.291 --> 06:39.208
would know he's in

06:37.291 --> 06:39.208
a house crush.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.792
You really have to

06:39.250 --> 06:41.792
watch this show.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.959
- You know, I wish we could

06:41.834 --> 06:43.959
talk face-to-face.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.959
But with our situation,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.959
this is the way it has to be.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.959
- I told you. Face-to-face.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.625
Tensions mounting.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.625
Sparks flying!

06:51.667 --> 06:53.542
- Ow and shh!

06:53.583 --> 06:55.709
- No, you're the cutest.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.750
No, you are.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.959
- Romance ensues.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.959
- Ow!

07:04.166 --> 07:07.250
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.250
- Mae, you've been

07:07.291 --> 07:09.875
"mm-hmming" at me

07:07.291 --> 07:09.875
for 20 minutes now.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.291
He doesn't like me.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.291
- Mm-hmm.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.333
Sorry, I've been

07:13.333 --> 07:15.333
eating peanut butter.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.667
And I was trying to tell you

07:15.375 --> 07:17.667
that my mouth was stuck.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.375
But about the whole

07:17.709 --> 07:20.375
Britt not liking you part,

07:20.417 --> 07:22.250
mm-hmm.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.166
- Mae, seriously,

07:22.291 --> 07:24.166
you've been watching

07:24.208 --> 07:26.208
way too much reality TV.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.500
- Well, there's only one way

07:26.250 --> 07:28.500
to solve this.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.417
You said he's always

07:28.542 --> 07:30.417
drawing portraits of this girl

07:30.458 --> 07:32.333
so we can look

07:30.458 --> 07:32.333
in his sketch book.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.875
- He doesn't want anyone

07:32.375 --> 07:33.875
to look at it.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.583
He's very private.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.041
- If he didn't want

07:35.625 --> 07:38.041
anyone to look at it,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.458
would he have left it

07:38.083 --> 07:39.458
sitting out here

07:39.500 --> 07:41.792
on the coffee table?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.792
- He didn't.

07:41.834 --> 07:45.458
You went up in his room,

07:41.834 --> 07:45.458
got it and put it there.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.542
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.834 --> 07:53.041
- Hold on. We can't be sure

07:49.834 --> 07:53.041
Britt's talking to Dawn.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.125
We need to get eyes on this.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.375
- You're right. Let's move.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.959
- Thanks for the lap.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.959
- And the fries.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.667
- See? It's not Dawn.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.834
- Ow. What do you mean?

08:10.709 --> 08:13.834
It's clearly her in a wig.

08:13.875 --> 08:17.083
- That hair color

08:13.875 --> 08:17.083
totally works on you.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.166
- Hey! Stop hitting me.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.166
- No, you stop hitting me.

08:19.208 --> 08:23.041
- No!

08:19.208 --> 08:23.041
- [struggling]

08:23.083 --> 08:25.792
- I wish you could be here

08:23.083 --> 08:25.792
with me in America, Debra.

08:25.834 --> 08:29.458
- I'm telling you, it's just

08:25.834 --> 08:29.458
like season four, episode 12.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.166
Sherril and Dave wore wigs so

08:29.500 --> 08:32.166
they could keep their secret.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.291
- [sighs] I can't believe

08:35.667 --> 08:37.291
I'm saying this

08:37.333 --> 08:39.959
but I think you're right.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.834
It is Dawn

08:40.000 --> 08:42.834
- It is me.

08:42.875 --> 08:45.333
both: Told ya.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.667
<i>- ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

08:47.583 --> 08:49.667
<i>la, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

08:49.709 --> 08:52.417
- This is bad.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.166
If my parents find out

08:52.458 --> 08:55.166
that Britt has a crush on me,

08:55.208 --> 08:57.291
it's see ya,

08:55.208 --> 08:57.291
wouldn't wallaby ya.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.208
- No Britt, no more free stuff.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.917
- No more lip gloss,

08:59.250 --> 09:01.917
nail polish, mascara.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.458
- Soy candles, splat balls,

09:01.959 --> 09:04.458
all gone!

09:04.500 --> 09:06.125
- But it's not

09:04.500 --> 09:06.125
all about the stuff.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.750
You'd be losing a friend,

09:06.166 --> 09:07.750
right?

09:07.792 --> 09:10.291
- Uh--yeah, I mean,

09:07.792 --> 09:10.291
didn't you hear me?

09:10.333 --> 09:13.250
I said friend gloss,

09:10.333 --> 09:13.250
nail palish

09:13.291 --> 09:15.709
and I mascare about Britt.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.375
- We need to figure out a way

09:15.750 --> 09:18.375
to crush this house crush

09:18.417 --> 09:20.166
before it crushes us.

09:18.417 --> 09:20.166
- Yeah, but we just

09:20.208 --> 09:22.125
need to talk to him.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.125
- Maybe I need to talk to him.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.750
both: Bad idea.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.375
- On "T-POT"--

09:23.792 --> 09:26.375
"12 People, One Toilet"--

09:26.417 --> 09:28.834
Dave was crushing

09:26.417 --> 09:28.834
hard on Sherril.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.458
But when Sherril went to tell

09:28.875 --> 09:31.458
him it was bad for the house,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.417
it only made Dave crush harder.

09:33.458 --> 09:36.750
- And eventually, Sherril

09:33.458 --> 09:36.750
couldn't resist Dave's charms.

09:36.792 --> 09:38.500
Once the housemates

09:36.792 --> 09:38.500
got wind of it,

09:38.542 --> 09:40.750
they tried to talk

09:38.542 --> 09:40.750
to Sherril and Dave.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.166
- But the minute they knew

09:40.792 --> 09:43.166
their crush was forbidden,

09:43.208 --> 09:46.208
it only pushed them

09:43.208 --> 09:46.208
closer together.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.333
- Well, no one's

09:46.250 --> 09:47.333
pushing us together

09:47.375 --> 09:49.083
because I'm gonna

09:47.375 --> 09:49.083
push him away.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.166
- Okay, if we can't talk

09:49.125 --> 09:51.166
to him about his house crush,

09:51.208 --> 09:53.041
what do we do?

09:51.208 --> 09:53.041
- Research.

09:53.083 --> 09:54.834
There's gotta be a book

09:53.083 --> 09:54.834
on house crushes.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.792
- To the book store!

09:57.834 --> 10:00.583
- How is it that the book store

09:57.834 --> 10:00.583
has no books on house crushes?

10:00.625 --> 10:03.291
- And how is their café

10:00.625 --> 10:03.291
out of cake pops?

10:05.625 --> 10:10.166
- [scoffs]

10:05.625 --> 10:10.166
Sharing a small. Sad.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.875
- Just ring us up.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.000
- Nice nut dust.

10:14.041 --> 10:16.000
That'll be $4.37.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.583
- We've only got four.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.166
- Well, then,

10:17.625 --> 10:19.166
you've got 37 cents

10:19.208 --> 10:21.875
worth of not my problem.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.166
Keep going.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.333
- How much is it now?

10:31.375 --> 10:34.208
- $4.39.

10:31.375 --> 10:34.208
- How could it have gone up?

10:34.250 --> 10:36.375
- Spittle.

10:36.417 --> 10:37.834
Here, let me

10:36.417 --> 10:37.834
take care of it for you.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.000
- Oh.

10:40.709 --> 10:44.417
Wha--

10:40.709 --> 10:44.417
- There. Now it's $4.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.917
Bink.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.333
You know, if you'd brought

10:46.959 --> 10:49.333
your cute Australian friend,

10:49.375 --> 10:50.959
this all could've been

10:49.375 --> 10:50.959
on the house.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.333
- Well, then, we should

10:51.000 --> 10:52.333
get used to paying

10:52.375 --> 10:54.000
'cause Britt's as good as gone.

10:54.041 --> 10:57.083
- What? Why? How? When? Where?

10:57.125 --> 11:00.458
- Soon. He's in the middle of a

10:57.125 --> 11:00.458
serious house crush with Dawn.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.417
When our parents find out,

11:00.500 --> 11:02.417
he'll be sent home.

11:02.458 --> 11:05.000
- Oh, that's nothing.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.125
It'll be over before your

11:05.041 --> 11:07.125
parents find out anyway.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.667
- How do you know?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.083
- [sighs] I see a lot

11:08.709 --> 11:11.083
working here.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.000
And trust me, at this age,

11:13.041 --> 11:15.875
relationships are like

11:13.041 --> 11:15.875
fro-yo.

11:15.917 --> 11:19.375
Neither is as satisfying

11:15.917 --> 11:19.375
as ice cream.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.583
Point is, you've got

11:19.417 --> 11:21.583
nothing to worry about,

11:21.625 --> 11:23.500
as long as they don't advance

11:21.625 --> 11:23.500
to the old,

11:23.542 --> 11:25.166
boring couple stage.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.709
Wearing sweat pants,

11:25.208 --> 11:27.709
mall walking,

11:27.750 --> 11:30.583
and talking about the weird

11:27.750 --> 11:30.583
noises their bodies are making.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.125
Basically, people

11:30.625 --> 11:33.125
who have given up.

11:33.166 --> 11:34.834
Like them.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.709
- Is that your knee

11:34.875 --> 11:36.709
making that noise, Tom?

11:36.750 --> 11:39.458
- I was hoping

11:36.750 --> 11:39.458
it was yours, Anne.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.166
- That was horrifying.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.959
- Once a couple

11:42.208 --> 11:43.959
gets to that stage,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.500
their love is too strong and

11:44.000 --> 11:46.500
there's no breaking them up.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.166
- This is great.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.166
Dawn and Britt

11:48.208 --> 11:51.959
are nowhere near

11:48.208 --> 11:51.959
the giving up stage.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.208
- How do I look?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.208
- Like you've given up.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.500
- Perfect.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.500
Gimme my mouth guard

11:56.542 --> 11:59.000
and fire up the big guns.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.959
- I'm surprised Dicky didn't

11:59.041 --> 12:00.959
take his fart machine

12:01.000 --> 12:02.125
with him to Australia.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.750
- Oh, he packed his good one.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.250
This one doesn't go to wet.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.375
Time to gross this guy out.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.125
- Oh, hi, Nicky.

12:17.166 --> 12:20.917
- No, it's me...Dawn.

12:20.959 --> 12:24.208
- Oh, sorry. Nicky has

12:20.959 --> 12:24.208
the same bedtime routine.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.959
- So, what do you think

12:24.250 --> 12:27.959
of your special someone now?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.709
- [sighs] She's the best.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.917
A real beauty.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.083
- Well, you know what else

12:31.959 --> 12:35.083
I like to do before bed?

12:35.125 --> 12:39.583
Just let my body release all

12:35.125 --> 12:39.583
the impurities from the day.

12:40.750 --> 12:41.583
[fart machine malfunctions]

12:41.625 --> 12:43.667
[grunts]

12:45.959 --> 12:49.625
[laughs] See, I'm

12:45.959 --> 12:49.625
lettin' myself go!

12:49.667 --> 12:51.375
Yeah, just let it all out.

12:51.417 --> 12:55.250
Here we go, right now.

12:51.417 --> 12:55.250
[laughs]

12:55.291 --> 12:57.625
[farting sound]

12:55.291 --> 12:57.625
Ooh, ah, jeez.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.250
Oh, ooh.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.250
[farts]

12:59.291 --> 13:01.542
Sorry, that one

12:59.291 --> 13:01.542
just slipped out.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.125
[farts]

13:01.583 --> 13:03.125
Oof! [laughs, farts]

13:03.166 --> 13:05.792
Stressful day.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.792
Oh. [farts]

13:05.834 --> 13:07.959
Sorry, that one

13:05.834 --> 13:07.959
is just a big one. [farts]

There was a portrait
