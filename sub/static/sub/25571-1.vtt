03:11.574 --> 03:13.243
How's it going, sir?

03:15.621 --> 03:17.932
How you doing today?
Doing all right.

03:17.956 --> 03:20.101
Doing all right? Have
you met Jesus Christ?

03:20.125 --> 03:22.061
No, not personally.

03:22.085 --> 03:24.768
Sir, do you believe in Jesus Christ?
Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ.

03:55.162 --> 03:58.082
I got ten for ten,
mix and match.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.729
You want an egg?

04:03.753 --> 04:04.754
No.

04:06.882 --> 04:08.568
What time you get up?

04:08.592 --> 04:10.510
Just a second ago.

04:15.475 --> 04:20.103
Well, you better start practicing
waking up like normal people.

04:24.234 --> 04:25.235
Salmon.

04:27.112 --> 04:28.154
Tuna.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.662
Beef.

04:39.958 --> 04:40.959
Hello?

04:43.754 --> 04:45.381
Uh, this is him speaking.

04:47.883 --> 04:49.343
Officer Banks?

04:50.844 --> 04:52.530
Yeah, I appreciate your
returning my call.

04:52.554 --> 04:55.033
Um, I was actually hoping

04:55.057 --> 04:57.744
you would be able to grant me
exemption to travel out of state.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.537
It's my niece's
birthday next month,

04:59.561 --> 05:01.563
and my sister is having
a birthday party.

05:02.857 --> 05:06.193
On the... 30th of July.

05:07.695 --> 05:09.697
Um, in Arlington, Virginia.

05:10.782 --> 05:11.866
Yes, ma'am.

05:13.701 --> 05:16.204
Um, 3550...

05:17.372 --> 05:19.082
Nelly Curtis Drive.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.876
Um, it starts at 3:00.

05:23.045 --> 05:26.048
Um, probably 6:00 or 7:00.

05:29.968 --> 05:32.512
Yes, ma'am. I know. I'm
getting my days mixed up.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.393
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

05:39.937 --> 05:42.291
You too.

05:42.315 --> 05:43.941
I got you your salmon.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.381
It's okay. Hey, Dad,
did you get milk?

05:49.405 --> 05:51.383
What? Did you get milk?

05:51.407 --> 05:52.658
Use the creamer.

05:54.243 --> 05:56.579
- - I can't fucking
drink creamer.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.473
Hey, what's up?

06:18.643 --> 06:20.813
Going crazy. You gonna come?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.946
Yeah, another week and
I get this shit off.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.385
You know, the same.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.328
He can't say five
words without a nag.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.961
Yeah, I called her,
but, I mean, you know.

06:46.547 --> 06:48.359
She said it's not
enough time to process

06:48.383 --> 06:50.176
and a whole bunch
of other bullshit.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.807
Nothing. I just lost
track of the dates.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.748
I'm gonna miss you too.

07:01.772 --> 07:03.940
I'm gonna make Kara
a card, all right?

07:09.405 --> 07:11.299
Next week?

07:11.323 --> 07:13.993
All righty. Well, I'll be here.

07:18.414 --> 07:21.519
Nothing. I just wanted to let you know
that I tried to make it to the party,

07:21.543 --> 07:24.336
but it is what it is.

07:27.757 --> 07:30.009
He's in the garden
playing with his cats.

07:32.262 --> 07:33.680
Yeah, yeah.

07:35.432 --> 07:36.433
I love you more.

07:38.518 --> 07:40.771
Hey, Dad. It's Kate.

07:49.029 --> 07:50.322
Hey.

07:52.866 --> 07:54.201
Yeah.

07:57.455 --> 08:00.725
Well, I told him not to bother.

08:00.749 --> 08:03.461
He shouldn't push
it, especially now.

08:06.422 --> 08:09.217
I don't know. You're gonna
have to ask him yourself.

08:11.510 --> 08:12.721
Beats me.

08:15.306 --> 08:18.267
Volunteers of America
or the Job Corps.

08:19.561 --> 08:22.122
Ah, I think he's too old.

08:22.146 --> 08:25.484
I mean he's supposed to be studying
for his HVAC exam now, but...

08:27.527 --> 08:28.570
No, I don't know.

08:31.406 --> 08:32.407
Huh?

08:35.953 --> 08:37.496
He's too impatient.
You know that.

08:52.803 --> 08:53.846
Hey, yo.

09:14.493 --> 09:15.536
Oh, shit.

09:37.099 --> 09:38.285
Hey.

09:38.309 --> 09:39.686
Hey.

09:41.563 --> 09:43.874
We have a medium to
medium-high heat grill.

09:51.823 --> 09:54.635
Who was that? Courtney.

09:54.659 --> 09:56.137
She says "fuck you."

09:56.161 --> 09:58.472
That's the great thing
about a tenderloin.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.018
Hey.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.622
Courtney, huh?

10:22.646 --> 10:24.482
Yeah. Can I get some privacy?

10:27.861 --> 10:30.840
- Turn off that air conditioner.
- It's hot as hell in here.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.825
You start paying the electric
bill, you can get cool.

11:38.225 --> 11:39.268
So?

11:41.145 --> 11:42.831
She just brought me a box.

11:42.855 --> 11:45.083
I saw that. What was in it?

11:45.107 --> 11:46.358
Some things of mine.

11:47.359 --> 11:49.004
She say anything?

11:49.028 --> 11:52.591
Yeah. She said hi. Hi to you.
Hi to me.

11:52.615 --> 11:55.260
Happy this bullshit's coming off.
And she gave me a letter.

11:55.284 --> 11:57.095
You read it?

11:57.119 --> 11:58.371
No.

11:59.581 --> 12:00.832
Why didn't you read it?

12:02.375 --> 12:03.793
Why would I?

12:10.217 --> 12:12.361
You know the problem
with you, Keith?

12:12.385 --> 12:14.488
Yeah, and what's that, Dad?

12:14.512 --> 12:17.033
You don't wanna hear anything
that makes you feel guilty.

12:17.057 --> 12:18.827
Yeah, I don't think
that's my problem.

12:18.851 --> 12:20.664
I don't have a
problem with guilt.

12:20.688 --> 12:22.218
I have a problem with knowing
that I let everybody down.

12:22.230 --> 12:23.771
Well, then don't!

14:36.410 --> 14:38.012
Ha ha ha!

14:38.036 --> 14:40.974
- Who let the dog out?
- It's good to see you.

14:40.998 --> 14:43.518
Yeah, man. Son, you remember A-Rock?
Yeah.

14:43.542 --> 14:44.853
Where's your sister?

14:44.877 --> 14:48.273
- Yo, this is Busy.
- What's up, man?

14:48.297 --> 14:51.068
Yeah, we heard you got your box
off a couple of weeks ago.

14:51.092 --> 14:53.593
We know it's gonna be difficult.
We just wanted to come around

14:53.617 --> 14:55.553
and let you know we here
to help you transition.

14:55.577 --> 14:56.657
I appreciate that.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.408
You talk to anybody?

14:58.432 --> 15:00.035
Like who? Who?

15:00.059 --> 15:02.121
Fuck you mean, who?
Man, you got a plan?

15:02.145 --> 15:03.373
Not really.

15:03.397 --> 15:06.334
What you been cooking
the last six months?

15:06.358 --> 15:08.919
Nothing, man. Just trying to get
back on my feet. Baby steps.

15:08.943 --> 15:11.089
You ain't no baby.

15:11.113 --> 15:13.216
I've been born again.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.366
What?

15:16.743 --> 15:19.890
Shit. I was about to say, man.
You trying to work?

15:19.914 --> 15:21.767
Not really.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.351
Come on, dawg. This
ain't no buffet.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.978
You don't just dip
in and dip out.

15:25.002 --> 15:27.230
Remember your family, dawg.

15:27.254 --> 15:28.982
We was there for
you on the inside.

15:29.006 --> 15:30.692
We here for you on the outside.

15:30.716 --> 15:33.069
Yeah, I know. And I
appreciate that, Gary.

15:33.093 --> 15:36.681
But I need to be there for my real family
right now, the one inside this house.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.162
All right. It is good
to see you though.

15:41.186 --> 15:43.205
- Mm-hmm.
- Peace out.

15:43.229 --> 15:44.355
You too, man.

15:46.942 --> 15:49.527
Hey. Tell your sister
I said what's up.

15:50.696 --> 15:52.214
Man, shut the fuck up!

15:52.238 --> 15:54.575
Get in the van and
ride bitch, man!

16:34.657 --> 16:37.540
All right, we're gonna
talk about heat transfer.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.849
This is a topical outline
of what we're going to do.

16:40.873 --> 16:44.853
We're gonna talk about how
heat, which is energy, moves.

16:44.877 --> 16:48.189
We're gonna talk about heat
transfer coefficients... U values.

16:48.213 --> 16:50.900
HTM's... heat
transfer multipliers.

16:50.924 --> 16:54.654
And we're gonna define
sensible and latent heat.

16:54.678 --> 16:56.240
We're gonna tell you
what to measure.

16:56.264 --> 16:59.159
Walls. Gross, then net.
We'll talk about that.

16:59.183 --> 17:02.329
Partitions. Knee walls. Floors.

17:02.353 --> 17:04.748
Slab, elevated,
below-grade floors.

17:04.771 --> 17:07.416
Ceilings and roof combinations.

17:07.441 --> 17:11.130
Windows. Glazing, fenestration,
whatever you wanna call it,

17:11.154 --> 17:12.964
and direction become important.

17:12.989 --> 17:15.300
Doors, people, and appliances.

17:15.324 --> 17:17.970
All those things we're gonna talk about.
All right?

17:17.993 --> 17:21.848
So if somebody will hit the magic
start button, we will get going.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.040
Thank you.

18:29.068 --> 18:31.028
Hey, hey. What's good, Mr. John?

18:32.739 --> 18:35.342
Kale. Lettuce.

18:35.366 --> 18:37.094
Leafy greens.

18:37.118 --> 18:39.722
Waitin' on the beans.

18:39.746 --> 18:42.350
I see your dad out
watering twice a day.

18:42.374 --> 18:43.767
Yeah, he is.

18:43.791 --> 18:45.769
Tell him to grow
something he could eat.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.896
He doesn't really
mess with vegetables.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.482
You know he's not a
real practical man.

18:49.506 --> 18:52.986
Hey.

18:53.010 --> 18:55.196
I actually came over
to ask you a favor.

18:55.220 --> 19:00.034
I was hoping maybe I could borrow
your truck to run a few errands.

19:00.058 --> 19:04.163
Tank's empty. Maybe I could borrow
20 bucks to fill it up for you.

19:04.187 --> 19:07.792
I plan on getting paid. I just need a
little help getting back on my feet.

19:07.816 --> 19:09.919
You ask your dad?

19:09.943 --> 19:12.405
I'd like to avoid
that situation.

19:14.031 --> 19:15.949
Sorry to ask.

19:19.913 --> 19:21.431
You gonna return the favor?

19:21.455 --> 19:23.308
Yeah, anything you want, Mr.
John.

19:23.332 --> 19:25.794
Let me borrow your riding mower?
Yeah, absolutely.

19:27.211 --> 19:29.314
Go see Candace about the keys.
All righty.

19:29.338 --> 19:32.301
She probably layin' around the house
somewhere. All right, cool. Thank you.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.155
And hey.

19:36.179 --> 19:37.740
Welcome back.

19:37.764 --> 19:39.266
Thank you, Mr. John.

19:52.071 --> 19:53.113
Hey, yo, Candace!

19:56.826 --> 19:57.827
Candace!

20:02.498 --> 20:04.601
What's up? What you want?

20:04.625 --> 20:06.895
I need to borrow the truck.

20:06.919 --> 20:09.148
Okay. And what's that
got to do with me?

20:09.172 --> 20:10.966
Your dad said you had the keys.

20:14.594 --> 20:16.637
Hey, you miss me? Hell, no!

20:22.811 --> 20:24.414
I can't fuck with you no more.

20:24.438 --> 20:27.124
Yeah, and why's that?
You owe me an apology.

20:27.148 --> 20:30.213
Yeah, for what? You've been out for
a year and I haven't seen you.

20:30.237 --> 20:33.160
Candace, I've been on house arrest for
a year. What do you want me to say?

20:33.184 --> 20:34.477
You could've called me.

20:35.532 --> 20:36.867
You're not my girl, Candace.

20:37.826 --> 20:39.328
I know that, motherfucker.

20:42.248 --> 20:44.000
You need to stop
playing, Candace.Hmph.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.687
Here.

20:46.711 --> 20:48.921
Catch you later.Deuces.

21:29.172 --> 21:32.026
Hey, boy, I was wondering
when you were gonna show.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.610
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.195
What's new?

21:35.219 --> 21:36.989
Nothing much.

21:37.013 --> 21:39.867
I was talking to your sister. Are
you back in the swing of things?

21:39.891 --> 21:41.160
I'm trying.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.538
How's your dad? Same as ever.

21:43.562 --> 21:46.081
You haven't killed him yet? You
know he's the man of steel.

21:48.316 --> 21:49.919
Hey, you want a beer?

21:49.943 --> 21:52.672
I'm good right now.
Is, uh, Ladybug in?

21:52.696 --> 21:54.132
She's cooking supper.

21:54.156 --> 21:56.634
Supper? What time is it?

21:56.658 --> 21:59.786
Hey, you know she cooks all day long.
You know that.

22:02.706 --> 22:04.291
Hey, what's up, Mama?

22:05.751 --> 22:07.086
Who's that?

22:11.048 --> 22:13.068
Oh, my God.

22:13.092 --> 22:16.196
Oh, Keith. Oh, my baby.

22:18.097 --> 22:19.408
I missed you.

22:19.432 --> 22:21.743
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

22:21.767 --> 22:24.371
Ah, ah!

22:24.395 --> 22:26.498
How are you? I'm good.

22:26.522 --> 22:28.750
It's good to see you.

22:28.774 --> 22:30.795
You hungry? Yeah, sure.
I'll eat.

22:30.819 --> 22:31.963
Yeah. Oh, yeah?

22:31.987 --> 22:33.505
Go sit down. You need some help?

22:33.529 --> 22:35.216
No, no. You sit.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.169
I got your letters.

22:53.175 --> 22:55.011
I read your letters, Mama.

22:57.513 --> 22:59.265
But you didn't write back.

23:01.517 --> 23:03.036
Would you like a crab cake?

23:03.060 --> 23:04.311
Yeah.

23:07.815 --> 23:09.835
How's your father?

23:09.859 --> 23:11.986
Good. Same as ever.

23:13.029 --> 23:14.798
And Kate?

23:14.822 --> 23:16.991
She's actually coming
by this afternoon.

23:21.246 --> 23:22.998
Thank you.

23:27.044 --> 23:30.690
So, I heard Uncle Rick's
working that Fort Howard site.

23:30.714 --> 23:33.568
Yeah, he's making a
lot of money now.

23:33.592 --> 23:35.194
Yeah, I bet.

23:35.218 --> 23:39.491
You guys got any extra
work for me around here?

23:39.515 --> 23:42.619
I don't want you anywhere
near the liquor, Keith.

23:42.643 --> 23:44.704
Come on, Mama.

23:44.728 --> 23:46.897
You already have
enough temptation.

23:52.445 --> 23:56.175
I've been thinking a
lot about your mother.

23:56.199 --> 23:58.928
Her birthday was last week. Did
you remember it was her birthday?

23:58.952 --> 24:01.221
Yeah. Did you...
Did you visit her?

24:01.245 --> 24:03.265
I haven't got the chance yet.

24:03.289 --> 24:06.084
It's always hard for me around
your mother's birthday.

24:08.628 --> 24:10.773
You two did all kinds
of things together.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.425
You'd take long walks
around the neighborhood.

24:15.260 --> 24:20.867
You had this little ice cream
truck and you'd stop all the time

24:20.891 --> 24:25.246
and pick up little things
and put them in that truck.

24:25.270 --> 24:26.271
Little treasures.

24:28.858 --> 24:31.068
She was very devoted to you.

24:32.903 --> 24:34.905
She believed in you.

24:36.199 --> 24:38.635
But at 26 years old,

24:38.659 --> 24:42.431
you can go one way or the other.

24:42.455 --> 24:45.601
You can pull yourself out of it, which
I think you're on the way to doing,

24:45.625 --> 24:47.753
and try to figure out
some plan for your life.

24:49.295 --> 24:51.464
Or you can go right
back into it.

24:56.011 --> 24:58.096
You got to go back to school.

24:59.890 --> 25:03.102
That's the only chance you have.
You're not too old.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.332
You can start again.

25:07.356 --> 25:10.961
You can go to CCBC. You
already have a year.

25:10.985 --> 25:13.154
I'll help pay for your books.

25:14.488 --> 25:16.341
I've got your
grandfather's pension.

25:16.365 --> 25:19.094
Plus, I've got my
social security.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.723
Plus, I have a little money left
from your mother's insurance.

25:22.747 --> 25:24.642
Who knows how long
I'm gonna last?

25:24.666 --> 25:26.852
I'm not taking your money.

25:26.876 --> 25:28.878
I don't want you to
waste what you've got.

25:30.380 --> 25:33.026
I know how smart you are.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.819
Mama, I don't know if I'm
ready to go back to school.

25:35.843 --> 25:38.990
I just need to find a job.

25:39.014 --> 25:42.702
Well, where are you gonna work?
What are you gonna do?

25:42.726 --> 25:45.646
I don't know yet, but I'm
gonna figure something out.

25:47.856 --> 25:51.920
You're the most important
thing in my life, Keith.

25:51.944 --> 25:53.487
Don't say that.

25:59.910 --> 26:02.121
Finish your...
Finish your supper.

26:03.206 --> 26:04.332
Eat.

26:35.447 --> 26:37.759
What's up, Uncle Rick?
What's up, Keith?

26:37.783 --> 26:39.385
How you doing? Good.
Good to see you.

26:39.409 --> 26:41.680
Good to see you.

26:41.704 --> 26:43.640
Yeah, Ladybug called.
I was hoping.

26:43.664 --> 26:46.059
I got a haul for you.
It's only about 50 or 60.

26:46.083 --> 26:47.769
It works. All right, cool.

26:47.793 --> 26:49.896
Pull the truck over to the
dock and we'll load up.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.022
Right around here? Yep.

26:51.046 --> 26:51.982
All right, cool. All right.

26:52.006 --> 26:53.007
Thank you.

26:54.259 --> 26:56.177
Hey, Rob, you got a
pair of gloves for him?

27:30.421 --> 27:31.923
Come on back.

27:34.551 --> 27:35.885
Keep going.

27:38.179 --> 27:39.556
All right, you're good.

27:46.188 --> 27:48.958
You probably want these.
Thank you.

27:48.982 --> 27:51.961
Ah, this looks good. Hell, yeah.

28:39.534 --> 28:41.896
What's up, man? Not much.
What's going on, man?

28:41.920 --> 28:44.256
All steel? Yeah, it should be.

28:45.084 --> 28:46.725
Okay, you're good.
Yeah, thank you.

28:46.749 --> 28:47.750
No problem.

29:09.107 --> 29:10.709
Hey, what's up? Hi.

29:10.733 --> 29:12.711
I just dropped a load off.
All right.

29:12.735 --> 29:15.506
You've got, um, 45.80.

29:15.530 --> 29:17.591
Damn, that's it? Yep.

29:17.615 --> 29:18.926
Thank you. Have a good one.

29:18.950 --> 29:19.951
You too.

30:15.008 --> 30:17.236
Watch your back, nigga!
You fuckin' kidding me?

30:17.260 --> 30:18.582
You're getting real
fuckin' brave!

31:28.501 --> 31:30.963
What the fuck, motherfucker?
You're lucky I don't have my gun!

31:30.987 --> 31:33.966
I guess it's time for you to start
learning how to use those fuckin' hands!

31:33.990 --> 31:36.152
I will fuck you up! Yeah, bet.

31:36.176 --> 31:38.011
Pussy-ass bitch.

32:20.347 --> 32:21.950
What's up?

32:21.974 --> 32:23.284
I'm late.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.119
Can you please take these
kids away from me?

32:25.143 --> 32:26.955
What's up, Jack? How you doing?

32:26.979 --> 32:29.397
Uncle Keith! It's
good to see you.

32:30.566 --> 32:32.711
Hey. Hey, Grandpa!

32:32.735 --> 32:33.986
Come here.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.242
Can we play out back?
Can we play out back?

32:43.496 --> 32:45.390
No luck?

32:45.414 --> 32:47.852
What's that lawyer good for?

32:47.876 --> 32:50.437
He's not my lawyer.
He's the state's.

32:50.461 --> 32:54.692
He's not answering my calls,
and probations isn't budging.

32:54.716 --> 32:56.801
It's like they only care
when I'm fucking up.

32:58.595 --> 33:02.074
So, why aren't you having
this party in Maryland?

33:02.098 --> 33:04.327
She wants her friends
there, Keith.

33:04.351 --> 33:07.455
Why did you even move to Virginia?
Keith.

33:07.479 --> 33:09.999
I got some stuff. You
didn't have to do that.

33:10.023 --> 33:13.419
It's inside the truck.
I made a card too. Ah!

33:13.443 --> 33:17.632
Jesus, Keith. You should not be
spending all your money on Cheetos.

33:17.656 --> 33:19.033
Yeah, I didn't have an envelope.

33:20.117 --> 33:22.178
Oh!

33:22.202 --> 33:24.473
She's gonna love that. Yeah?

33:24.497 --> 33:26.808
Here, let me help you with this.

33:26.832 --> 33:28.626
All right, I'll pop the trunk.
All right.

33:37.802 --> 33:39.637
Is that all of it? Yeah.

33:42.598 --> 33:45.411
I was gonna tell you this Sunday,
but we are getting a new car.

33:45.435 --> 33:47.204
Yeah, it's about time.

33:47.228 --> 33:49.206
Oh, I didn't realize
you were so fancy.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.418
I guess I won't give
it to you then.

33:51.442 --> 33:53.364
Seriously? Yeah, I'll find
somebody who wants it.

33:53.388 --> 33:56.048
Stop playing. You
know I want it.

33:56.072 --> 33:58.315
- When can I get it?
- As soon as the loan comes through.

33:58.339 --> 34:01.178
Nice. Thank you.Mm-hmm.

34:01.202 --> 34:03.329
You and dad doing okay?

34:05.581 --> 34:07.434
When we're in separate rooms.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.561
He's a lot easier
than he used to be.

34:09.585 --> 34:12.355
Believe me. Just
try to be patient.

34:12.379 --> 34:14.065
I need to get out of here.

34:14.090 --> 34:15.900
Where are you gonna go?

34:15.925 --> 34:18.654
I don't know yet,
but I can't do it.

34:18.678 --> 34:20.072
Just relax.

34:20.096 --> 34:22.074
Please.

34:22.098 --> 34:25.118
You're so impatient.
You're just like Mom.

34:25.141 --> 34:27.079
You ever think that's
why he hates me?

34:27.103 --> 34:28.956
He doesn't hate you.

34:28.980 --> 34:31.690
Do you think he would be doing
all of this if he hated you?

34:33.860 --> 34:35.629
I gotta go. All right.

34:35.652 --> 34:37.364
Mmm.

34:40.574 --> 34:42.469
All right. Thanks for all of this.
I know.

34:42.494 --> 34:45.056
I wish I could be there. I know.
I wish you could too.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.725
She would rather have
her uncle with her

34:46.748 --> 34:48.851
than all the snacks
in the world.

34:48.876 --> 34:50.268
Next year.

34:50.293 --> 34:52.063
Promise?

34:52.087 --> 34:53.565
I swear.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.751
Keith!

35:33.714 --> 35:35.841
You good? All right.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.288
All right, you ready?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.979
Pull it all the
way to the right.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.755
Thanks for getting
the spot, Jess.

36:36.779 --> 36:39.342
No problem. I know
it's been a while.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.761
When I get my money up, I'm gonna
come see you at the club though.

36:42.785 --> 36:45.639
I'm at the Gold Club on Thursdays.
You should come by there.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.391
Oh, yeah? Yeah. It's
nicer than the Russian.

36:47.415 --> 36:49.102
Getting fancy?

36:49.126 --> 36:51.312
I'll save up, all right?
Yeah, you better.

36:51.336 --> 36:52.605
You ready? Yeah.

36:52.629 --> 36:54.798
All right, let's do this.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.791
Hey.

37:11.815 --> 37:13.418
I'll see ya.

37:13.442 --> 37:14.818
I'll see ya.

37:18.239 --> 37:20.092
Hey, go make that dirty money.

37:20.116 --> 37:21.426
I'm going to school,
you asshole.

37:31.378 --> 37:34.399
Okay, don't forget. - 50.

37:34.423 --> 37:36.734
Okay? For lunch.

37:36.758 --> 37:39.904
Yes. I'll talk to
you in a few...

37:39.928 --> 37:43.012
Could you hold... Oh, just... Could you
hold just a moment, please? Thank you.

37:43.036 --> 37:44.367
Yes. May I help you?

37:44.391 --> 37:47.037
Um, I'm looking for the HVAC
workshop that I signed up for.

37:47.061 --> 37:50.040
Yes. You're a little late,
but they may let you in.

37:50.064 --> 37:52.751
Um, you can go in that room
over there and see Mr. Monte.

37:52.775 --> 37:53.960
Mr. Monte? Mr. Monte. Yes.

37:53.984 --> 37:55.706
Thank you very much. You
have a blessed day.

37:55.730 --> 37:57.005
Yes.

37:57.029 --> 38:00.384
Excuse me, sir. I signed
up for the HVAC class.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.743
What's your name?
Uh, Keith Cohill.

38:07.873 --> 38:10.394
Forget it. Forget what?

38:10.418 --> 38:12.604
I have a note here that you
didn't show last week,

38:12.628 --> 38:14.732
and you're 45 minutes
late for week two.

38:14.756 --> 38:17.526
It would cause a disruption
if you join the group now.

38:17.550 --> 38:21.280
Sir, I'm on probation. I
can get a note from my PO.

38:21.304 --> 38:24.285
Nope. I'm sorry. It's policy.

38:24.309 --> 38:26.752
You'll have to enroll in the class
the next time it's offered.

38:26.776 --> 38:28.079
Well, when's that?

38:28.103 --> 38:30.290
I won't know until September.

38:30.314 --> 38:31.374
You serious?

38:31.398 --> 38:33.234
What'd I say?

38:34.318 --> 38:36.153
All right, man, thank you.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.341
Yo, Marquis here?

39:19.365 --> 39:21.134
Who's askin'? It's Keith.

39:26.497 --> 39:27.998
Now's not a good time.

39:29.625 --> 39:30.978
Yo, did I stutter?

39:31.002 --> 39:33.313
Yo, just tell him to come to the door.
It's Keith.

39:33.337 --> 39:34.839
Marquis, it's Keith!

39:36.590 --> 39:39.486
I got it, man. All right.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.822
What's up, man? Damn,
yo, what's up?

39:41.846 --> 39:44.700
Chillin'. How you doin'? Damn.

39:44.724 --> 39:46.243
The fuck is you
geekin' for, man?

39:46.267 --> 39:48.390
Look, like he told you, we're
a little busy right now.

39:48.414 --> 39:49.872
Tryin' to get a hold of you.

39:49.896 --> 39:51.916
I know. Check this out though.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.502
Hey, yo, turn that shit back up.

39:54.526 --> 39:57.047
Yeah, boy.

39:57.071 --> 39:59.883
Hell, yeah, we gonna get on the
radio with this shit. It's you?

39:59.907 --> 40:02.677
Hell, yeah. Man, this ain't no hobby
no more. We gettin' on with this.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.847
Sounds good. Sounds good. Hell, yeah.
What about you?

40:05.871 --> 40:08.183
Just tryin' to get back on
my feet, make some money.

40:08.207 --> 40:11.186
Mm. Let me guess. You
need some help with that?

40:11.210 --> 40:13.730
I got a car now. And
I know Northeast.

40:13.754 --> 40:15.524
Okay.

40:15.548 --> 40:17.609
And I know bars you
can't walk into.

40:17.633 --> 40:20.821
I'm sure you do, Honky Tonk.

40:20.845 --> 40:22.531
Where your skateboard at, man?

40:22.555 --> 40:24.200
What?

40:24.224 --> 40:26.035
You don't skateboard no more?
No.

40:26.059 --> 40:27.268
Well, what you doin' now?

40:28.686 --> 40:30.414
Been drawing a lot.

40:30.438 --> 40:32.541
Okay. That's what's up.
Drawing what?

40:32.565 --> 40:34.168
Draw whatever. Anything.

40:34.192 --> 40:38.214
All right, well, we're about
to finish this album up.

40:38.238 --> 40:41.926
We need some artwork for it. I can get
'em to send you the link when it's done.

40:41.950 --> 40:44.095
Maybe it'll give you some inspiration.
For sure. For sure. Please.

40:44.119 --> 40:45.347
All right, cool.Yeah.

40:45.371 --> 40:47.390
I'm gonna send you something
to move next week.

40:47.414 --> 40:48.516
Yeah? Yeah.

40:48.540 --> 40:49.809
I appreciate that, man.

40:49.833 --> 40:51.769
You wanna text my phone?
I don't got a phone yet.

40:51.793 --> 40:53.438
But, I mean, I can slide
through whenever.

40:53.462 --> 40:54.564
All right, Friday. Friday?

40:54.588 --> 40:56.257
Friday. For sure, man.
Thanks, Quis.

41:27.414 --> 41:28.415
What's up?

41:29.708 --> 41:31.460
You good? Yeah, yeah. Get in.

41:38.467 --> 41:40.654
God. It's not my day.

41:40.678 --> 41:42.305
Been out here all morning.

41:45.599 --> 41:47.411
Where you headed?

41:47.435 --> 41:48.853
Harford and Ailsa.

41:51.022 --> 41:53.000
How much you looking to get?

41:53.024 --> 41:54.706
I've been trying to get
on since yesterday.

41:55.985 --> 41:58.548
I'll give you head for 20.What?

41:58.572 --> 42:00.883
I thought you were
trying to score.

42:00.907 --> 42:02.158
I...

42:02.951 --> 42:04.160
I am.

42:06.371 --> 42:08.457
Look, I'm so sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.

42:11.126 --> 42:13.897
Can I... Can I
smoke in your car?

42:13.921 --> 42:15.005
Yeah.

42:19.301 --> 42:21.386
You need a cigarette? Yeah.

42:22.597 --> 42:24.474
Yeah. Thank you.

42:36.652 --> 42:40.299
But I'm... so sorry.

42:40.323 --> 42:42.634
I'm such a mess.

42:42.658 --> 42:46.806
I know if I don't score,
he's gonna hit me.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.600
Who's gonna hit you?

42:48.624 --> 42:49.875
My boyfriend.

42:50.876 --> 42:52.628
He makes me come out here.

42:54.755 --> 42:56.507
He makes you come out here?

42:59.009 --> 43:01.220
I just wanna die.

43:03.097 --> 43:04.723
You want me to take
you to the hospital?

43:07.184 --> 43:09.537
Well, I would if I
could, but I...

43:09.561 --> 43:10.831
I can't leave my cat.

43:12.899 --> 43:15.794
I know it's so stupid.
You wouldn't understand.

43:15.818 --> 43:17.880
But she's the one thing
that keeps me alive.

43:17.904 --> 43:22.385
She's the sweetest girl. She's...
She's my baby.

43:22.409 --> 43:23.535
What's her name?

43:24.702 --> 43:26.180
Crete.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.456
Like "concrete."

43:32.669 --> 43:34.087
Here.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.589
It's gonna be 25.

43:40.218 --> 43:41.887
Ah, fuck.

43:44.097 --> 43:46.701
Look, that's all I... that's
all I got on me, okay?

43:46.725 --> 43:48.703
Yeah, it don't work like that.

43:48.727 --> 43:50.914
Come on. Just take it.
It don't work like that.

43:50.938 --> 43:54.650
No, I'll get the rest off my boyfriend.
I promise, okay?

43:57.445 --> 43:59.113
You need to go home.

44:14.295 --> 44:16.106
What else you got? What is it?

44:16.130 --> 44:17.817
That is quality merchandise.

44:17.841 --> 44:20.486
Yeah, whatever. Well,
it works for me.Yeah.

44:20.510 --> 44:22.029
Hey, Ms. Patty. Hey.

44:22.053 --> 44:23.656
Can I get one of the Blue Steels?
Sure.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.865
Thank you. You're welcome.

44:24.889 --> 44:28.161
How much a pack?2.99 a pound.

44:28.185 --> 44:29.830
And this is...

44:29.854 --> 44:31.790
You leaving? No,
just takin' a piss.

44:31.814 --> 44:33.917
Catch you later, all right?

44:33.941 --> 44:36.211
I'll throw in a bag. Butterfly
these motherfuckers.

44:36.235 --> 44:37.277
No, I don't want these.

44:39.196 --> 44:40.924
You good? Uh, yep.

44:40.948 --> 44:43.134
I would say hop in, but I
think it would be tight.

44:43.158 --> 44:45.077
I'll follow you on the bike.
All right, man.

45:23.784 --> 45:25.929
Seven.Okay.

45:25.953 --> 45:28.348
I think I'm about five
short there, brother.

45:28.372 --> 45:30.392
No, you good, man. Old times.

45:30.416 --> 45:32.394
Have a good one. All right.
Thanks, man.

45:32.418 --> 45:33.812
Be easy, all right? All right.

45:33.836 --> 45:35.523
Hit me up if you need me.

45:35.547 --> 45:38.007
All right. You stay out of trouble.
Yeah, I will. You too.

46:03.158 --> 46:05.929
We need six-inch blades.

46:05.953 --> 46:09.457
15, uh, 6-1-1-3.Excuse me.

46:10.374 --> 46:13.353
And we need 40-19, uh...

46:13.377 --> 46:15.064
Excuse me.

46:15.088 --> 46:16.982
59-15.Excuse me!

46:17.006 --> 46:18.150
Oh. What?

46:18.174 --> 46:19.568
Are you Riha?

46:19.592 --> 46:22.321
No. Riha's downstairs.

46:22.345 --> 46:23.763
Downstairs? Downstairs.

46:26.182 --> 46:27.827
What do you need? Are you Riha?

46:27.851 --> 46:29.161
Yeah.

46:29.185 --> 46:30.663
I left my mower a while back,

46:30.687 --> 46:32.582
and I was wondering
if you still had it.

46:32.606 --> 46:33.916
What color? It's orange.

46:33.940 --> 46:35.460
You push it? Yeah.

46:35.484 --> 46:38.171
How long ago did
you bring it in?

46:38.195 --> 46:40.881
Uh, over a year ago.
It's electric.

46:40.905 --> 46:43.051
Ah. I got one here that's
been sittin'.Yeah?

46:43.075 --> 46:44.784
Come on. I'll show you.
Thank you.

46:47.204 --> 46:51.977
Seven-inch wheels and
side discharge, no mulch?

46:52.001 --> 46:54.438
Yeah, that sounds about right.

46:54.462 --> 46:56.130
That the one?

46:57.214 --> 46:59.568
Ah, yeah, that's her.

46:59.592 --> 47:01.469
I got it. I got it.
Don't worry about it.

47:05.723 --> 47:09.644
I replaced the battery cord
and cleaned the air vent.

47:10.686 --> 47:11.998
It might still need a blade,

47:12.022 --> 47:13.791
but it's cheaper
to do it yourself.

47:13.815 --> 47:16.585
Just be careful. Yes, ma'am. What's the...
What's the total?

47:16.609 --> 47:19.296
I'll never find that receipt.
Just give me 40 bucks.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.381
Forty? Yeah.

47:20.405 --> 47:21.406
Thank you.

47:26.453 --> 47:28.580
There you go. Appreciate that.

47:53.523 --> 47:55.400
I got your mower.

47:56.901 --> 47:59.338
What are you doing here? I
was in the neighborhood.

47:59.362 --> 48:01.507
You should have called
me before you came here.

48:01.531 --> 48:03.092
I thought you might need it.

48:03.116 --> 48:05.053
I could have got that myself.

48:05.077 --> 48:07.513
Court, it's been there
for, like, two years.

48:07.537 --> 48:09.182
Who's cutting your lawn?

48:09.206 --> 48:11.517
My brother cuts my lawn, Keith.

48:11.541 --> 48:13.061
Tell him I stopped by.

48:13.085 --> 48:14.437
No.

48:14.461 --> 48:17.214
I won't, 'cause you
shouldn't even be here.

48:19.342 --> 48:20.884
Well, you want it or not?

48:23.136 --> 48:25.264
Geez, yes, I want it. It's mine.

48:27.266 --> 48:29.494
How much was it for the repairs?

48:29.518 --> 48:31.288
Can I see Scout?

48:31.312 --> 48:33.123
How much?

48:33.147 --> 48:35.734
Don't worry about it.
Just let me see my dog.

48:36.567 --> 48:38.128
I gotta get to work.

48:38.152 --> 48:41.173
Court. Please.

48:41.197 --> 48:43.783
Why won't you listen to me?
Let me see Scout.

48:46.953 --> 48:48.764
Five minutes.

48:48.788 --> 48:51.726
And then I want you to go. Okay?

48:51.750 --> 48:54.669
You want me to bring this out back?
Yes, whatever.

49:12.104 --> 49:13.814
Scout, mama, come here.

49:15.149 --> 49:16.276
Come here, Scout.

49:17.735 --> 49:19.505

49:37.756 --> 49:39.526

49:39.550 --> 49:42.028
She teach you anything?

49:42.052 --> 49:44.071
Hey.

49:44.095 --> 49:45.573
Give me high five.

49:49.435 --> 49:51.079
You tired?

49:51.103 --> 49:52.479
You tired?

49:56.192 --> 49:59.028
All right, Keith, I gotta go.
Scout.

50:01.531 --> 50:02.532
Good.

50:04.659 --> 50:06.160

Hey, how you doing?

50:49.205 --> 50:53.561

a Boy?

50:53.585 --> 50:54.770
Okay.

51:04.554 --> 51:06.199
Hey.

51:06.223 --> 51:07.700
What's up, Kelsey? Come on.

51:07.724 --> 51:09.143
What? Come here.

51:14.940 --> 51:16.417
Are you crazy? What?

51:16.441 --> 51:18.336
You shouldn't be here. Why?

51:18.360 --> 51:20.046
I heard you pissed
off Gary and them,

51:20.070 --> 51:22.072
and now you're fucking
around with those hood rats.

51:22.096 --> 51:24.510
Who the fuck are you talking
to like that, Kelsey?

51:24.534 --> 51:25.677
I'm gonna do what I please.

51:25.701 --> 51:27.804
Yeah, well, I talk how I please.

51:27.828 --> 51:30.682
You know, you're
real fuckin' stupid.

51:30.706 --> 51:32.684
Why you always trying
to find trouble?

51:32.708 --> 51:35.604
I'm not. Yeah, well,
why are you here then?

51:35.628 --> 51:37.856
I'm just here to talk to Jessie.

51:37.880 --> 51:39.984
Well, she's with a client.

51:40.008 --> 51:42.236
So, you want a dance?
Not from you.

51:43.636 --> 51:45.239
Well, I know you ain't broke.

51:45.263 --> 51:46.448
Whatever, man.

51:46.472 --> 51:47.766
I know you're holding.

51:49.643 --> 51:51.269
Yeah, says who? See?

51:52.563 --> 51:54.582
Don't matter. Why
don't you put me on.

51:54.606 --> 51:57.294
Get the fuck out of here
with that shit. No, you.

51:57.318 --> 51:59.546
I'm just here to see Jessie.
Fuck you then!

52:17.296 --> 52:18.798
How are you? How are you?

52:33.939 --> 52:36.000
Hey, Jessie. What's up?

52:36.024 --> 52:38.670
Um, I'm with my
friend right now,

52:38.694 --> 52:40.672
so, uh, can we talk a
little bit later, Keith?

52:40.696 --> 52:42.924
Your friend? Yeah, my friend.

52:42.948 --> 52:44.050
What time do you get off?

52:44.074 --> 52:46.094
Um, in a little bit,
so you can give me...

52:46.118 --> 52:47.596
Fucker!

52:47.620 --> 52:48.621
Stop!

52:50.456 --> 52:53.518
You bitch! Get the fuck off me!

52:53.542 --> 52:56.105
Get the fuck off... Keith!

52:56.129 --> 52:58.732
Get the fuck off...
Keith! Keith!

52:58.756 --> 53:01.235
Get the fuck off me!
You don't mean it.

53:01.259 --> 53:02.981
Yo, ain't nobody playin'
with your dumb ass!

53:03.005 --> 53:04.321
Bitch-made-ass motherfucker!

53:04.345 --> 53:06.115
Stop! Are you okay?

53:06.139 --> 53:08.033
Fuck. Why did you
come here, Keith?

53:08.057 --> 53:09.350
I came to see you.

53:10.602 --> 53:13.247
Come with me. Are you drunk?

53:13.271 --> 53:15.791
Come on. I'm lonely.
I'm working, Keith.

53:15.815 --> 53:18.503
Yeah, he's working too.
Shut the fuck up, Kelsey!

53:18.527 --> 53:21.363
Why the fuck you even out here? Come on.
Go clean yourself up.

53:23.490 --> 53:25.034
I just wanted to see you.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.870
You should go to the hospital.

53:31.832 --> 53:34.209
I'll hit you later, all right?

53:36.546 --> 53:38.881
Stupid-ass motherfucker.

53:40.299 --> 53:41.384
Come on.

54:03.824 --> 54:04.908
I saw that.

54:05.659 --> 54:06.743
What'd you see?

54:09.245 --> 54:12.934
I'm staying up at Patapsco and
Willow Spring Road, on the corner.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.418
I got some heat if
you're thirsty.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.064
Right on the corner.

54:17.088 --> 54:19.232
Just ask for Wasp.

56:15.460 --> 56:17.980
Me and you, motherfucker!
You're a fuckin' punk!

56:18.004 --> 56:19.651
You hit me from behind
in a crowded bar.

56:19.675 --> 56:22.077
If they ain't pull me off, I'd
have broken your fuckin' nose.

56:22.101 --> 56:22.944
Now's your chance.

56:22.968 --> 56:24.321
Go back to your mom's day
care, you fuckin' runt.

56:24.345 --> 56:25.705
Don't talk about
my fuckin' mother.

56:25.729 --> 56:26.706
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck your mom.

56:26.730 --> 56:27.730
Fuck!

56:28.932 --> 56:30.101
What the fuck!

56:47.744 --> 56:50.055
Hey, yo.

56:50.079 --> 56:51.974
What'd I tell you?

56:51.998 --> 56:55.018
I told you to stop dealing
with them corny motherfuckers.

56:55.042 --> 56:58.731
Is you all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

56:58.755 --> 57:01.317
Shit. Good thing recycling didn't
come around today for real,

57:01.341 --> 57:02.863
'cause they would've
got they head hit.

57:02.887 --> 57:04.153
Hell, yeah.

57:04.177 --> 57:06.365
Shit. Look, man,

57:06.389 --> 57:08.832
I don't know what you was fuckin'
with when you was locked up,

57:08.856 --> 57:11.285
but around here, we don't
fuck with them boys.Yeah.

57:11.309 --> 57:13.287
Stop talking to 'em. I know.

57:13.311 --> 57:15.707
How long you lived in
this neighborhood?

57:15.731 --> 57:18.167
Fifteen years. All right then.
You should know better.

57:18.191 --> 57:20.712
Your father used to work at
Bethlehem Steel with my father.

57:20.736 --> 57:22.338
This our neighborhood.
This ain't up top.

57:23.739 --> 57:25.634
You got a broom, yo? What?

57:25.658 --> 57:27.618
Fuck. Clean this shit up.

Stupid ass, man.

57:32.040 --> 57:34.977
That's my nigga, but

57:35.001 --> 57:37.229
I'm tryin' to spare
his ass, man.

57:37.253 --> 57:39.505
That shit was funny,

57:40.674 --> 57:45.136
Hey. Big man, what's up, baby?

58:21.132 --> 58:23.509
What's up, dawg? Yo,

58:33.436 --> 58:35.958
Keith. I need to see Mom.

58:35.982 --> 58:37.263
I don't know you from Adam, man.

58:37.287 --> 58:39.624
As far as I'm concerned,
you might be Five-0.

58:43.364 --> 58:45.258
State the oath.

58:45.282 --> 58:48.303
On my honor, uh,

58:48.327 --> 58:51.514
I swear to keep myself physically
strong, mentally agile,

58:51.538 --> 58:53.058
and spiritually awakened.

58:53.082 --> 58:54.601
I'm honorable and loyal.

58:54.625 --> 58:57.938
I'm respectful, helpful,
shrewd, and straight.

58:57.962 --> 59:00.899
I have self-discipline,
self-respect, and endurance.

59:00.923 --> 59:03.527
I have dignity, morality,
and integrity.

59:03.551 --> 59:05.387
You a little rusty,
homeslice, but come on.

59:20.235 --> 59:21.569
Have a seat, bitch.

59:54.020 --> 59:55.271
Have we met?

59:56.440 --> 59:59.710
Yes, sir, uh, briefly in Jessup.

59:59.734 --> 01:00:02.755
Oh, Jessup dawg.

01:00:02.779 --> 01:00:07.093
Who did you associate with?
I was assistant to FA.

01:00:07.117 --> 01:00:08.553
Moneyman.Yeah.

01:00:08.577 --> 01:00:12.057
Smoke? No, I'm good.

01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:14.249
It's rose petal and
some marshmallow.

01:00:17.002 --> 01:00:19.004
Natural.

01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:22.568
How long you been out?

01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:24.510
Just got done nine
months home detention.

01:00:29.014 --> 01:00:31.327
You need work?

01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:34.871
Yeah, but I got mixed up with the
wrong people, and I want out.

01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:36.582
Who?

01:00:36.606 --> 01:00:38.334
Little G was my FG,

01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:41.527
but I know him as Gary from
way back when in Dundalk.

01:00:42.904 --> 01:00:45.800
Does he respect your decision?
I don't know.

01:00:45.824 --> 01:00:48.201
He came to my house uninvited
with a couple of soldiers.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:52.349
And? I was hoping

01:00:52.373 --> 01:00:55.215
maybe you could tell him to stop flexing
and let me get back on my feet.

01:00:58.337 --> 01:01:00.005
Are you a white man?

01:01:02.424 --> 01:01:03.884
As far as I know.

01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:08.365
That's good.

01:01:08.389 --> 01:01:10.701
Then remember...

01:01:10.725 --> 01:01:13.286
these inactions are a mirror.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.914
They reflect the character
of the individual

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:19.377
defined by dignity,
morality, and integrity.

01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:22.630
Okay, that's the eye.

01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:25.591
The eye is a radical
fucking thing.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:29.803
Separate the honorable from the
dishonorable, conflict goes away.

01:01:29.827 --> 01:01:33.141
True virtue is based on
what is morally right.

01:01:33.165 --> 01:01:34.851
The truth conforms to reality,

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:37.920
but it can only be found,
right, in the conscience.

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:41.816
In the consciousness.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.071
Now, if you choose a falsehood based
on preference rather than true truth,

01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:49.115
you give yourself to a lie.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.950
And when you give
yourself to a lie,

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.619
you commit yourself
to destruction.

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:57.606
And your life... simply
comes to destruction.

01:01:58.774 --> 01:02:00.377
Yes, sir.

01:02:00.401 --> 01:02:03.964
Power in teachings of the
eye changes men, right,

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:06.050
into great men,

01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:08.803
and it alters completely.

01:02:08.827 --> 01:02:11.847
The whole moral a-a-and
mental outlook

01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:15.083
Mm-hmm. of those who
walk within the eye.

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:21.023
Those who enter the eye.

01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:23.258
Do you understand what I'm saying here?
Yeah, I do.

01:02:27.387 --> 01:02:30.450
Listen to me, okay?
This is a science.

01:02:30.474 --> 01:02:33.954
I walk like this
and talk like this

01:02:33.978 --> 01:02:35.938
to reach you in
your fucking mind.

01:02:37.982 --> 01:02:40.001
When you see me, you
say, "What the fuck?"

01:02:40.025 --> 01:02:43.988
Because I walk with
"what the fuck."

01:02:45.281 --> 01:02:48.594
I want you to walk
with "what the fuck."

01:02:48.618 --> 01:02:49.928
Hmm? Yes, sir.

01:02:49.952 --> 01:02:51.662
Remember it.

01:02:53.623 --> 01:02:57.186
The wise and honorable

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.421
always keep their kingdom
and their land...

01:03:02.924 --> 01:03:08.680
and their house clean of
foolishness and dishonor.

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.225
So you can help me with this?

01:03:18.357 --> 01:03:21.986

Nice. That is some
expert cake cutting.

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.943
Can you say hi to your uncle?

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.696
Hello!

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.783
I miss you. We miss you.
We love you.

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.368
Mwah, from both of us.

01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:15.037
Good job.

01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:41.106
What's up? How's it going?

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.339
Getting in?

01:05:48.555 --> 01:05:52.075
I missed my bus.

01:05:52.099 --> 01:05:53.935
Thank you.Yeah.

01:05:55.562 --> 01:05:59.750
Oh, it's hot. How much you need?

01:05:59.774 --> 01:06:02.711
No, baby, I'm headed
down to the clinic.

01:06:02.735 --> 01:06:05.613
Down on Sinclair. Oh,
you on a program?

01:06:06.782 --> 01:06:08.134
Three weeks.

01:06:08.158 --> 01:06:09.660
Congratulations.

01:06:10.953 --> 01:06:12.037
Thank you.

01:06:14.915 --> 01:06:16.625
Can I bum a cigarette? Yeah.

01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:23.067
Shit. You probably need it.

01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:25.343
You got it.

01:06:27.428 --> 01:06:30.032
Mmm. Yeah.

01:06:30.056 --> 01:06:32.868
I had to get off the dope.

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:35.329
My son is living with me now.

01:06:35.353 --> 01:06:38.123
Too much going in and out
of the house, you know?

01:06:38.147 --> 01:06:40.358
That's good. Trying to
set a good example.

01:06:43.027 --> 01:06:46.757
I want my boyfriend and my son
to come with me to the clinic,

01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:51.387
but they don't got no patience.

01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:54.349
They can wait all day to cop, but they
can't wait 30 minutes for the bus.

01:06:54.373 --> 01:06:55.934
How much you payin'?

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.228
160, but I'm on
reduced disability.

01:06:59.544 --> 01:07:01.272
No, for the methadone.

01:07:01.296 --> 01:07:03.215
Oh.

01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:07.219
Uh, ten dollars, two bottles.

01:07:08.513 --> 01:07:11.617
Yeah. Medicaid cover it? Half.

01:07:11.641 --> 01:07:13.827
Nice.

01:07:13.851 --> 01:07:16.037
So what, how much do I owe you?

01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:18.665
Nah, don't worry about it. I
was heading this way anyway.

01:07:18.689 --> 01:07:21.293
How come?

01:07:21.317 --> 01:07:23.337
My mom's buried at
Baltimore Cemetery.

01:07:23.361 --> 01:07:24.946
I wanna go visit her.

01:07:30.076 --> 01:07:32.972
Have a good one.Thanks.

01:07:32.996 --> 01:07:34.164
See you later.

01:07:37.543 --> 01:07:38.835
You take care.

01:09:44.424 --> 01:09:47.236
How were you inspired to get
all these colors like this?

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.185
Very nice.

01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:01.293
Excuse me. What is your name?
Keith.

01:10:01.317 --> 01:10:03.336
Keith, you know that this
is a nonsmoking campus.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.321
Is it? Yes.

01:10:07.323 --> 01:10:08.532
It's good to know.

01:10:10.326 --> 01:10:11.577
Thank you, Keith.

01:10:12.912 --> 01:10:14.306
Thank you, dude.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.309
So, these row houses
are all set up

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:19.061
like the bricks and
the marble steps,

01:10:19.085 --> 01:10:20.337
and these colors came from it.

01:10:45.446 --> 01:10:47.757
Do I know you? No.

01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.927
Then why are you following me? I'm not.
I'm walking to my car.

01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:53.138
Really? Really.

01:10:53.162 --> 01:10:55.599
- What's your name?
- Aurora.

01:10:55.623 --> 01:10:57.767
And what was so funny, Aurora?
I'm not laughing.

01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:59.228
I saw you laugh at me.

01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:01.254
You were staring at my drawing.

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.358
Do you go here? No.

01:11:04.382 --> 01:11:06.110
Thinking about it though.
For art?

01:11:06.134 --> 01:11:09.279
No. I need to make a living.

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:11.366
What were you doing in
the art building then?

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:13.493
I was lost.

01:11:13.517 --> 01:11:15.870
Where's your car?
Right down there.

01:11:15.894 --> 01:11:17.479
Drive me home?

01:11:22.234 --> 01:11:24.819
Take your shoes off.
They're dirty.

01:11:39.877 --> 01:11:41.813
It's like a museum in here.

01:11:41.837 --> 01:11:44.733
Oh, yeah. My parents are fans.
What do they do?

01:11:44.757 --> 01:11:47.278
Do you want some salami?
Yeah. Thank you.

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:50.239
My dad works for Aberdeen.
My mom doesn't.

01:11:50.263 --> 01:11:53.993
Where they at? Miami. Yours?

01:11:54.017 --> 01:11:58.414
My dad's retired, and, uh, my
mom died a few years back.

01:11:58.438 --> 01:12:01.375
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:12:01.399 --> 01:12:02.651
It's all good.

01:12:08.114 --> 01:12:11.117
I've been watering these down too much
already. They're beginning to notice.

01:12:13.745 --> 01:12:16.975
Do you wanna get high?

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:19.644
How old are you again?
How old are you?

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:20.687
Take a guess.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:23.523
Mm.

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:25.108
I don't wanna know that bad.

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:31.598
A'ight. Now the second left.

01:12:40.942 --> 01:12:44.106
There's some parking at the front. You can
park in one of the handicapped spots.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.382
Who's handicapped? Me.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.052
Are you fucking kidding me?
What?

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.721
You're a real classy guy.

01:12:52.745 --> 01:12:55.914
Come on. It's nice on the inside.
Come on.

01:13:09.053 --> 01:13:10.054
What?

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.617
Oh, yeah? Like that?

01:13:31.034 --> 01:13:33.763
She good. You can't
come in here.

01:13:33.787 --> 01:13:35.140
Why is that?

01:13:35.164 --> 01:13:38.184
'Cause Tommy said no. Why?

01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:40.145
Because he can't have no
trouble in here, man.

01:13:40.169 --> 01:13:42.355
Because that fucking
clown jumped me?

01:13:42.379 --> 01:13:45.525
He broke a fucking bottle over my head.
I could've called the cops.

01:13:45.549 --> 01:13:47.694
Really? You like the police?

01:13:47.718 --> 01:13:49.988
Fuck you. Let me in.
Yo, move on.

01:13:50.012 --> 01:13:51.573
Hey. Don't fucking
touch me, man.

01:13:51.597 --> 01:13:54.141
Yo, too late. Let's go someplace else.
Forget it.

01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:02.358
Hey, wait up.

01:14:06.487 --> 01:14:09.926
Where are we going? I need to
go talk to somebody real quick.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.035
Why? Don't worry about it.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:16.832
Should I just go home? No.

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.548
All right. I'm just gonna
say hi real quick.

01:14:45.111 --> 01:14:46.237
Is Wasp here?

01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:54.305
Mike's upstairs.

01:14:54.329 --> 01:14:57.808
Who? Wasp.

01:14:57.832 --> 01:15:01.020
How do I get there? Around
the corner, straight up.

01:15:01.044 --> 01:15:02.170
Cool. Uh-uh.

01:15:03.171 --> 01:15:05.441
She stays here.

01:15:05.465 --> 01:15:07.217
I'll be right back, all right?

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.560
Well, make yourself comfortable.

01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:19.187
Come on. Have a seat.

01:15:36.289 --> 01:15:38.100
Hey, look who came for a visit.

01:15:38.124 --> 01:15:40.645
What's up, man? Come on in, bro.
Make yourself at home.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:43.314
You want one of these? Yeah.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.131
Come on. Sit down.
Take a load off.

01:15:46.883 --> 01:15:49.237
Fuck.

01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:51.739
Yeah, I had a parole violation
hearing this morning.

01:15:51.763 --> 01:15:53.966
Had to go up to the Bronx and
take care of some business

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:55.701
and this fucking
Lojack ratted me out.

01:15:55.725 --> 01:15:59.330
So I wrapped it up and took it with me
just in case the hearing went south.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:01.416
Thank God it didn't. Here
I am rolling cigarettes.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.877
I had to pay ten bucks each
for these in the joint.

01:16:03.901 --> 01:16:06.797
Yeah, I know. Wait, this was
up your ass this morning?

01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:08.882
Yeah. It was... It
was wrapped up.

01:16:08.906 --> 01:16:12.511
You think I'd be licking this
shit if it was wild in my rectum?

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:14.096
Just smoke the fucking thing.
It's free.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.847
Am I charging you for it? No.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:19.101
No. So you've been inside.
You know about these things.

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:22.021
Yeah. Remember that
conversation we had?

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:24.190
Yeah.

01:16:24.214 --> 01:16:26.216
I remember the conversation.
What do you need, bro?

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.027
What you working with?

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.821
Right now all I
got is a Beretta.

01:16:29.845 --> 01:16:32.824
Give me a week, I can get pretty much
anything you want within reason.

01:16:32.848 --> 01:16:35.034
Yeah, I don't think I can
wait a week right now.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:37.161
Youngblood's in a hurry, huh?

01:16:37.185 --> 01:16:38.913
I got ya. Come on.
I'll set you up.

01:16:38.937 --> 01:16:41.648
Follow me down to the basement.
That's where I keep my tools.

01:16:49.281 --> 01:16:51.593
Yo, where'd that girl go?

01:16:51.617 --> 01:16:54.262
She left. Why?

01:16:54.286 --> 01:16:56.264
Yo, what'd you do to her?

01:16:56.288 --> 01:16:58.767
Hey, this is my
house, motherfucker.

01:16:58.791 --> 01:17:01.269
- I'll do whatever I want.
- You fucking touch her?

01:17:01.293 --> 01:17:03.481
You know what? Get
the fuck outta here.

01:17:03.505 --> 01:17:06.984
Hey! You step to this guy, Karl?

01:17:07.008 --> 01:17:08.530
Who the fuck are you kidding?
Sit down.

01:17:09.761 --> 01:17:10.762
Sit down.

01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:14.408
You wanna do this or what? Yeah.
Let's be quick, huh?

01:17:14.432 --> 01:17:15.433
Come on.

01:17:26.987 --> 01:17:28.321
Yo, Aurora!

01:17:29.365 --> 01:17:30.699
Get in. What are you doing?

01:17:33.118 --> 01:17:36.997
- Come on. What happened?
- Fuck you, man. I don't even know you.

01:17:38.624 --> 01:17:40.793
A'ight then. I thought
you were down.

01:18:34.515 --> 01:18:36.493
Who are you? Kelly.

01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:39.288
Who else lives here? My mom.

01:18:39.312 --> 01:18:40.873
And my brothers.

01:18:40.897 --> 01:18:43.751
- Aaron?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

01:18:43.775 --> 01:18:45.920
Is he home? Yes.

01:18:45.944 --> 01:18:47.225
Why don't you go get him for me?

01:19:09.093 --> 01:19:10.094
Fuck.

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.838
Come on, motherfucker! Get
that motherfucker, man!

01:19:27.862 --> 01:19:29.758
Put him in the fucking van!

01:19:29.782 --> 01:19:32.225
You're lucky I didn't blast
your whole fucking family!

01:19:32.249 --> 01:19:32.886
Bullshit.

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:36.264
Motherfucker! Fuck off, bitch!

01:19:36.288 --> 01:19:38.474
Ooh.

01:19:38.498 --> 01:19:40.769
I'm not fucking
playing with you!

01:19:40.793 --> 01:19:43.837
- Think I'm playing with you?
- Stupid-ass motherfucker.

01:19:46.507 --> 01:19:48.551
Bullshit! Bullshit, Keith!

01:21:05.506 --> 01:21:07.233
What's that smell?
There's some smoke.

01:21:07.257 --> 01:21:10.487
I think it smell like
somebody cooking shit.

01:21:10.511 --> 01:21:12.780
Yo, what's he doing?
Yo, look at that shit.

01:21:12.804 --> 01:21:14.406
- Oh, Fuck!
- Fucking shit!

01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:28.631
Oh! Motherfuck! Get
that motherfucker, man!

01:21:28.655 --> 01:21:30.215
Yo, put that shit out!

01:21:30.239 --> 01:21:31.616
A-Rock!

01:21:33.951 --> 01:21:35.119
Fuck it, man.

01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:42.228
Fuck! That shit's out? Yeah.

01:21:42.252 --> 01:21:43.813
All right. Get the
fuck in the van, man.

01:22:25.922 --> 01:22:28.943
Yeah. There's my Scout.
What's up?

01:22:28.967 --> 01:22:30.110
How you doin'?

01:22:30.134 --> 01:22:31.404
Come here.

01:22:39.186 --> 01:22:40.312
Scout.

01:22:41.771 --> 01:22:42.833
Come here.

01:23:34.911 --> 01:23:36.596
Still out?

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.748
Yes, sir. Oh! I'll take it.

01:23:41.333 --> 01:23:43.562
All right. Spades are
still out, right?

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:45.063
Don't you growl now.

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:47.566
That's yours.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:49.509
All those hearts you have, huh?

01:23:50.885 --> 01:23:52.196
Come here, Scout.

01:23:54.722 --> 01:23:57.451
Come here. Good girl.

01:23:57.475 --> 01:24:01.122
Good girl. Oh, you
miss Daddy, huh?

01:24:01.146 --> 01:24:02.147
Hey.

01:24:03.899 --> 01:24:05.442
How you doin'?

01:24:15.828 --> 01:24:18.664
Scout, lay down. Lay down.

01:24:20.082 --> 01:24:22.460
Lay down. Mom ain't
teach you nothin'.

01:24:36.933 --> 01:24:40.371
"Dear Keith, I tried writing
this letter so many times."

01:24:40.395 --> 01:24:42.833
Scout, stay.

01:24:42.857 --> 01:24:44.579
"I tried writing this
letter so many times,"

01:24:44.603 --> 01:24:46.419
and I still don't
know what to say.

01:24:46.443 --> 01:24:48.754
Do I need to say anything?

01:24:48.778 --> 01:24:53.009
Nobody has known me longer than
you, known me better than you.

01:24:53.033 --> 01:24:56.221
And I know it's the same
the other way around.

01:24:56.245 --> 01:24:58.014
In one way or another,

01:24:58.038 --> 01:25:01.517
almost half my life
was spent with you.

01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.562
You were my family, Keith.

01:25:03.586 --> 01:25:07.941
Can you understand what it did
to me when you went away?

01:25:07.965 --> 01:25:12.279
I spent the last two years getting
used to living in a world without you.

01:25:12.303 --> 01:25:16.367
And now that you're free, you
can go do whatever you want.

01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:18.559
I expect you to do the same.

01:25:21.687 --> 01:25:25.542
You need to adjust to a
world without me, Keith.

01:25:25.566 --> 01:25:27.544
Please do not stop
by unannounced.

01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:29.547
Please do not call
me for no reason.

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:33.700
Please do not come up with any excuses
so that you can violate these terms.

01:25:35.619 --> 01:25:38.515
We can't pick up
where we left off.

01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:41.750
You can't depend on me to be your
friend or your family or anything.

01:25:43.585 --> 01:25:46.923
I really can't handle it. I
hope you understand this.

01:25:48.507 --> 01:25:51.820
"Please keep yourself out of trouble.
Courtney."

01:25:53.095 --> 01:25:54.847
Scout, stay here, baby. Quiet.

01:26:01.896 --> 01:26:04.207
Yeah, why not? Mmm.

01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:05.834
You got that one. Whoa.

01:26:05.858 --> 01:26:07.295
You're out of spades? Really?

01:26:07.319 --> 01:26:10.173
Bam. Oh, you!

01:26:10.197 --> 01:26:12.716
Shit. You got a handful of spades.
There you go.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.011
Damn it. You're out. All right.

01:26:15.035 --> 01:26:16.512
All right, all right.

01:26:16.536 --> 01:26:19.891
- Go back to clubs.
- There he is, the prodigal son.

01:26:19.915 --> 01:26:22.018
- Hey, Keith.
- How you doin', fellas?

01:26:22.042 --> 01:26:24.353
- Where you been?
- Out.

01:26:24.377 --> 01:26:25.730
Hey, Keith, you want in?

01:26:25.754 --> 01:26:27.649
Yeah, sure.

01:26:27.673 --> 01:26:30.360
You know, I'm gonna sit
the next hand out.

01:26:30.384 --> 01:26:33.071
I need a smoke. No, w-wait.
No way you're leavin'.

01:26:33.095 --> 01:26:35.865
No, no, no. Let him go. He
gets dizzy when he smokes.

01:26:35.889 --> 01:26:38.994
Don't try and stop me.
I got my e-cig.

01:26:39.018 --> 01:26:42.081
- What flavor, Gilbert?
- Grape. What else? C'mon.

01:26:42.105 --> 01:26:46.001
Are these washed? Yes, sir.
Washed and cleaned.

01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:48.671
All right. You know the
rules of the game?

01:26:48.695 --> 01:26:50.422
Yeah.

01:26:50.446 --> 01:26:53.884
Well, you're dealing left, but
remember, we're passing right.

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:56.429
- No, we just did that.
- It's a new game.

01:26:56.453 --> 01:26:58.138
Why are we starting a new game?

01:26:58.162 --> 01:27:00.790
Got the kid in. Two
of clubs lead?

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:03.269
No. Left of dealer.

01:27:03.293 --> 01:27:05.188
That's not the way I learned.

01:27:05.212 --> 01:27:07.174
House rules, baby.
And I'm the house.

01:27:07.198 --> 01:27:08.483
Yes, you are.

01:27:08.507 --> 01:27:10.443
So how's that Rocket 88, huh?

01:27:10.467 --> 01:27:14.364
Rocket 88's movin' and
groovin' along in style.

01:27:14.388 --> 01:27:16.407
Love that damn car.
Big-ass thing.

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.993
Yeah. It rides nice.

01:27:18.017 --> 01:27:21.913
It's got those big back seats,
big front seat, no console.

01:27:21.937 --> 01:27:23.790
You know what they
used to call those?

01:27:23.814 --> 01:27:25.292
What's that? Baby makers.

01:27:25.316 --> 01:27:28.086
You ain't makin' no more babies.

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.132
Goddamn right I'm not.
Let's hope not.

01:27:31.156 --> 01:27:33.675
You know, I remember when I
bought my first new car.

01:27:33.699 --> 01:27:37.471
I'd been working at Bethlehem
Steel for six months.

01:27:37.495 --> 01:27:38.931
Bad pass.

01:27:38.955 --> 01:27:41.726
- Why is that?
- You want me to shoot the moon?

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.896
Well, anyway, I bet that
dealer saw me coming

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.690
and thought, "Here's a loser."

01:27:47.714 --> 01:27:50.318
What the fuck does
this kid want?"

01:27:50.342 --> 01:27:52.945
- I didn't have any credit at the time.
- Of course not.

01:27:52.969 --> 01:27:55.448
He looked at me like I
was a piece of garbage.

01:27:55.472 --> 01:27:59.119
I was about to leave with
my tail between my legs.

01:27:59.143 --> 01:28:01.914
And then he asked me,
uh, where I worked.

01:28:01.938 --> 01:28:04.582
I told him I worked
at the Point.Yeah.

01:28:04.606 --> 01:28:08.503
He got all excited, asked
me about my brass check.

01:28:08.527 --> 01:28:11.924
Ah, the golden ticket.
What's a brass check?

01:28:11.948 --> 01:28:15.343
Well, that's what I said,
you know, but he said, um,

01:28:15.367 --> 01:28:18.556
"You know, your work ID, from
the Point, where you work."

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:22.810
So I pulled my work card out of
my pocket and showed it to him.

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:26.897
He took it, went and rubbed it, just
like they did at the plant, you know?

01:28:26.921 --> 01:28:30.526
Came back with his supervisor and
said I could pick any car I wanted.

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:32.195
Nice.

01:28:32.219 --> 01:28:35.531
Man, I tell ya, working at the
Point could get you anything.

01:28:35.555 --> 01:28:37.390
Except an honest retirement.

01:28:39.852 --> 01:28:42.038
- Oh!
- Seriously?

01:28:42.062 --> 01:28:43.915
- Ouch.
- Happens to the best of us.

01:28:43.939 --> 01:28:46.582
- What just happened?
- Keith just ate the queen.

01:28:46.606 --> 01:28:48.398
Who threw it? Take a wild guess.

01:28:48.422 --> 01:28:50.672
- Asshole.
- Yeah, no fucking kidding.

01:28:50.696 --> 01:28:54.676
What? What do you want me
to do, take it easy on ya?

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:58.305
Hold your hand? Come on, I saw
the opportunity and I took it.

01:28:58.329 --> 01:29:00.891
Stop cryin'.Who's cryin'?

01:29:00.915 --> 01:29:02.601
You're acting like a little boy.

01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:04.252
What the fuck does
that even mean?

01:29:06.004 --> 01:29:07.523
What did you just...

01:29:07.547 --> 01:29:08.858
Shit. What the hell's that?

01:29:08.882 --> 01:29:10.109
It's Scout.

01:29:10.133 --> 01:29:12.152
Scout? What is her
dog doing here?

01:29:12.176 --> 01:29:14.489
It's not her dog, and it's
none of your fucking business.

01:29:14.513 --> 01:29:17.325
This is my fucking house.
It is my goddamn business.

01:29:17.349 --> 01:29:18.909
Whose dog it is anyway?

01:29:18.933 --> 01:29:20.036
It's my fucking dog!

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.287
It's not your dog!

01:29:21.311 --> 01:29:23.789
It's my fucking dog!
It's not your dog!

01:29:23.813 --> 01:29:25.792
Goddamn it! Give me that!

01:29:25.816 --> 01:29:28.044
Hey! Fuck! Shit, Keith!

01:29:28.068 --> 01:29:29.379
Fuck!

01:29:33.991 --> 01:29:35.660
What the fuck, man?

01:29:39.121 --> 01:29:42.625
♪ Don't let me go ♪

01:29:45.295 --> 01:29:48.756
♪ And now we've reached
Our sad song ♪

01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:59.013
Is hit deep to left field.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:02.892
Hooking down the line. And
that one will be off the wall.

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:06.146
They will wave Ferguson around third.
He will score.

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:10.859
Into second with an RBI
double is Collin Woody.

01:31:10.883 --> 01:31:13.653
Stay. Firebirds lead
1-nothing on the double...

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:15.280
and a nice...

01:31:16.389 --> 01:31:17.766
Stay.

01:31:28.568 --> 01:31:31.046
What happened? I don't know.

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:32.114
Oh, Jesus.

01:31:34.616 --> 01:31:35.969
Hi.

01:31:37.827 --> 01:31:40.932
I don't understand 'cause he doesn't
have keys to the house anymore.

01:31:40.956 --> 01:31:43.894
If he broke into my house, I'm
gonna have to press charges.

01:31:43.918 --> 01:31:46.271
I don't blame you.

01:31:46.295 --> 01:31:49.317
I just wish you'd wait till
morning and think about it.

01:31:49.341 --> 01:31:52.184
Carol, I don't feel safe. I feel like
I have to get a restraining order.

01:31:52.208 --> 01:31:56.422
D-Don't do that, please.
Please, just sleep on it.

01:31:57.139 --> 01:31:58.909
Now, don't patronize me.

01:31:58.933 --> 01:32:00.494
I'm not gonna be able
to sleep tonight.

01:32:06.732 --> 01:32:08.026
Where is he?

01:32:09.527 --> 01:32:10.570
I do not know.

01:32:12.488 --> 01:32:14.115
What am I supposed to do?

01:32:15.492 --> 01:32:17.136
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna go home,

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.973
and I can't go home, and I can't
leave my house by itself, clearly.

01:32:20.997 --> 01:32:24.101
I have to call the police.
No, don't, don't, don't.

01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:27.355
Please don't. Really. Think
about his position here.

01:32:27.379 --> 01:32:29.482
I mean, wh-what are the
cops gonna do, really?

01:32:29.506 --> 01:32:31.484
Are you kidding me?

01:32:31.508 --> 01:32:34.029
He's not a teenager. He's
a grown fucking man.

01:32:34.053 --> 01:32:37.365
Why does everybody treat him like
he's a goddamn child. I mean, fuck.

01:32:48.234 --> 01:32:49.486
Please?

01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:55.843
I can give him until midnight.

01:32:55.867 --> 01:32:57.428
But if he's not
home in two hours,

01:32:57.452 --> 01:32:59.746
then I am gonna call the police.
Thank you.

01:33:01.206 --> 01:33:03.559
You know, I, um,

01:33:03.583 --> 01:33:07.045
I really thought that he was
gonna come out of this stronger.

01:33:09.882 --> 01:33:11.091
Come on, Scout.

01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:21.352
Will you call me
when he gets in?

01:33:23.104 --> 01:33:24.355
I will.

01:33:29.068 --> 01:33:30.194
