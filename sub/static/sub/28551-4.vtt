WEBVTT

00:06.094 --> 00:07.928
WOMAN: Why didn't you press
the AZ-5 button?

00:08.887 --> 00:12.136
We did.
And that's when it exploded.

00:14.094 --> 00:15.678
MAN: I don't want my men here
one more second

00:15.762 --> 00:16.887
than they need to be.

00:18.845 --> 00:20.969
If these worked,
you'd be wearing them.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.053
-LYUDMILLA IGNATENKO: Vasily...
-(MAN BREATHES HOARSELY)

00:24.428 --> 00:25.928
We're gonna have a baby.

00:27.345 --> 00:29.470
WOMAN 2: Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

00:29.553 --> 00:30.803
People are going to hear.

00:30.887 --> 00:32.470
MAN 2:
What is everyone gonna hear?

00:33.637 --> 00:35.803
VALERY LEGASOV: We have
to pursue every possibility,

00:35.887 --> 00:37.428
no matter who is to blame.

00:37.637 --> 00:41.762
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

00:42.345 --> 00:43.762
How many men do you require?

00:44.720 --> 00:46.928
BORIS SHCHERBINA:
Approximately 750,000 men.

01:01.303 --> 01:03.969
(liquid squirting rhythmically)

01:18.386 --> 01:20.470
(flies buzzing)

01:22.511 --> 01:24.637
(squirting continuing)

01:30.386 --> 01:31.969
Soldier:
It's time to go.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.928
Did you hear me?

01:36.011 --> 01:39.470
This is an evacuation.
You understand?

01:39.553 --> 01:41.261
You have to come with me.

01:41.345 --> 01:43.094
Why?

01:43.178 --> 01:46.261
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

01:46.345 --> 01:48.845
Everyone in this
village, everyone.

01:48.928 --> 01:50.845
It's not safe here.
There's radiation
in the air.

01:50.928 --> 01:52.887
What's wrong with you?

01:52.969 --> 01:54.553
Do you know how old I am?

01:54.637 --> 01:56.178
(flies buzzing)

01:56.261 --> 01:58.803
I don't know. Old.

01:58.887 --> 02:01.261
I'm 82.

02:01.345 --> 02:03.678
I've lived here my whole life.

02:03.762 --> 02:07.094
Right here, that house,
this place.

02:07.178 --> 02:11.094
Old Woman:
What do I care about safe?

02:11.178 --> 02:15.094
Soldier:
I have a job.
Don't cause trouble.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.553
Old Woman:
Trouble?

02:16.637 --> 02:20.637
You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.762
When I was 12,
the revolution came.

02:23.845 --> 02:27.969
Czar's men.
Then Bolsheviks.

02:28.053 --> 02:30.887
Boys like you
marching in lines.

02:30.969 --> 02:34.219
They told us to leave. No.

02:34.303 --> 02:36.803
Then there was Stalin
and his famine,

02:36.887 --> 02:38.969
the Holodomor.

02:39.053 --> 02:43.094
My parents died.
Two of my sisters died.

02:43.178 --> 02:45.803
They told the rest of us
to leave.

02:45.887 --> 02:47.470
No.

02:47.553 --> 02:49.303
Then the Great War.

02:49.386 --> 02:52.595
German boys.
Russian boys.

02:52.678 --> 02:56.219
More soldiers,
more famine, more bodies.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.969
My brothers
never came home.

03:00.053 --> 03:03.595
But I stayed,
and I'm still here.

03:03.678 --> 03:06.845
After all that I have seen...

03:06.928 --> 03:09.011
so I should leave now,

03:09.094 --> 03:12.678
because of something
I cannot see at all?

03:12.762 --> 03:13.720
No.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.928
(squirting continuing)

03:18.178 --> 03:20.219
-(bucket clanking)
-(milk swishing)

03:27.261 --> 03:31.261
-(horn honking)
-Just one moment!

03:38.762 --> 03:41.845
-(clanks)
-It's time to go.

03:48.553 --> 03:50.762
(sighs)
Please stand up now.

03:50.845 --> 03:52.969
(rhythmic squirting)

03:54.136 --> 03:56.261
(flies buzzing)

03:59.637 --> 04:01.219
(gun cocks)

04:01.303 --> 04:03.094
This is your
last warning.

04:09.637 --> 04:12.762
-(gunshot)
-(body thuds)

04:19.928 --> 04:21.803
It's time to go.

04:30.345 --> 04:32.470
(flies buzzing)

05:09.803 --> 05:11.887
(leaves rustling)

05:26.386 --> 05:28.511
(locks clanking)

05:34.845 --> 05:36.386
Woman:
Come on.

06:34.969 --> 06:38.345
(dosimeters clicking)

06:40.428 --> 06:42.637
Soldier (muffled):
Point four.

06:53.303 --> 06:55.136
Soldier 2:
Point six.

06:59.511 --> 07:02.136
-(dosimeter crackling)
-Soldier 3: Fifteen.

07:05.511 --> 07:07.637
(dosimeter crackling)

07:18.969 --> 07:22.678
(helicopter whirring overhead)

07:42.969 --> 07:45.136
(distant helicopters whirring)

07:54.428 --> 07:56.386
(phone rings)

07:59.386 --> 08:00.511
Legasov.

08:00.595 --> 08:02.803
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

08:02.887 --> 08:04.553
I'll meet him there.

08:16.678 --> 08:18.762
(trucks rumbling)

09:03.261 --> 09:05.470
Legasov:
The atom is a humbling thing.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.762
It's not humbling,
it's humiliating.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.345
Why is the core still
exposed to the air?

09:13.428 --> 09:15.386
Why have we not
already covered it up?

09:15.470 --> 09:19.345
We want to,
but we can't get close enough.

09:19.428 --> 09:23.261
The debris on the roof is
graphite from the core itself.

09:23.345 --> 09:27.428
Until we can push it off
the roof back into the reactor,

09:27.511 --> 09:29.720
it'll kill anyone
who gets near it.

09:29.803 --> 09:34.178
You can see the roof
is in three levels.

09:34.261 --> 09:37.428
We've named them--
the small one here is Katya.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.637
One thousand roentgen per hour.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.637
Presume two hours
of exposure is fatal.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.386
The one on the side-- Nina.

09:44.470 --> 09:46.595
Two thousand roentgen.
One hour, fatal.

09:46.678 --> 09:49.845
We used remote-controlled
bulldozers in Afghanistan.

09:49.928 --> 09:53.011
Too heavy.
They'd fall
right through.

09:53.094 --> 09:56.762
-So then...?
-Moon rovers.

09:56.845 --> 09:58.720
Lunokhod STR-1's.
They're light.

09:58.803 --> 10:01.595
And if we line them
with lead, they can
withstand the radiation.

10:01.678 --> 10:03.261
Shcherbina:
We couldn't put
a man on the moon.

10:03.345 --> 10:06.345
At least we can keep
a man off a roof.

10:06.428 --> 10:08.595
That is the most important
thing, General.

10:08.678 --> 10:11.762
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.261
Robots only.

10:14.345 --> 10:17.011
What about this
large section here?

10:17.845 --> 10:19.470
Masha.

10:20.428 --> 10:22.345
Twelve thousand roentgen.

10:23.762 --> 10:27.762
If you were to stand there
in full protective gear
head-to-toe for two minutes,

10:27.845 --> 10:29.637
your life expectancy
would be cut in half.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.094
By three minutes,
you're dead within months.

10:32.178 --> 10:35.261
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

10:35.345 --> 10:38.762
That amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

10:38.845 --> 10:40.178
The particles
literally shred

10:40.261 --> 10:42.261
the circuits
in microchips apart.

10:42.345 --> 10:45.094
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.678
Masha will destroy it.

10:46.762 --> 10:48.178
It would be fair
to say that

10:48.261 --> 10:51.386
that piece of roof is the most
dangerous place on Earth.

10:57.553 --> 11:01.219
So... what do we do?

11:03.219 --> 11:05.511
That's
what we wanted
to ask you.

11:58.637 --> 12:00.762
(indistinct chattering)

12:14.637 --> 12:16.803
(bottles clinking)

12:23.428 --> 12:25.303
(man coughing)

12:38.553 --> 12:41.428
(men singing)

13:22.511 --> 13:24.720
Tent 181?

13:28.094 --> 13:30.553
(scoffs, grunts)

13:39.303 --> 13:40.762
It's all right.
It's free.

13:42.053 --> 13:43.553
It's a little early.

13:47.345 --> 13:48.762
(grunts)

13:56.887 --> 13:58.011
Bacho.

14:00.261 --> 14:01.386
Pavel.

14:02.637 --> 14:04.219
-Yeah?
-Mm.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.595
What unit
were you in?

14:10.678 --> 14:13.011
Uh, they had me
in motor pool in Kiev,

14:13.094 --> 14:15.845
-but then they--
-Not this bullshit.

14:15.928 --> 14:17.261
In Afghanistan.

14:17.345 --> 14:20.553
Oh, um, I wasn't
in Afghanistan.

14:23.178 --> 14:24.470
I'm not in the military.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.470
(sighs)
They're running
out of men.

14:35.261 --> 14:37.386
(indistinct chattering)

14:41.470 --> 14:43.178
Showers. Food.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.969
Those guys,
they dig up the ground.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.553
Those guys,
they cut down trees.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.094
Those guys, they evacuate
people, I think,

14:52.178 --> 14:53.637
like villagers.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.178
What about them?

14:57.303 --> 14:59.178
I don't know them.
Fuck them.

15:01.428 --> 15:02.511
Janek!

15:04.011 --> 15:06.511
-What do you want?
-Give me an egg basket.

15:06.595 --> 15:09.845
-No, I've only got the one--
-Give me the fucking basket!

15:13.303 --> 15:15.720
He's with me,
you understand?

15:15.803 --> 15:17.470
Nobody fucks with him.

15:19.928 --> 15:21.762
We make these
from lead scrap.

15:21.845 --> 15:24.094
-Put it on
under your balls.
-Now?

15:24.178 --> 15:27.011
No, no. You can wait until
the radiation gives you a cunt.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.762
Yes, now.

15:30.887 --> 15:33.803
Over your clothes.
Fucking shit.

15:42.053 --> 15:44.470
-You ever go hunting?
-No.

15:45.303 --> 15:48.553
Well... today's
your lucky day.

15:48.637 --> 15:51.011
You, me,

15:51.094 --> 15:54.887
that ugly Armenian
in the tent, Garo,
we do animal control.

15:56.261 --> 15:57.637
Animal control?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.720
Yeah, they're
radioactive,

15:59.803 --> 16:02.053
so they have to go.

16:02.136 --> 16:04.345
But it's not hard.
They're mostly pets.

16:04.428 --> 16:07.887
They're happy to see you.
They run right up to you.

16:07.969 --> 16:08.928
Bang!

16:09.011 --> 16:10.470
You load the bodies
on the truck,

16:10.553 --> 16:12.928
dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete.

16:13.011 --> 16:14.720
And then we drink.

16:14.803 --> 16:19.053
As much vodka as you want,
plus a thousand rubles.

16:21.428 --> 16:22.928
Let's go get you a gun.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.845
(gate buzzes)

17:32.053 --> 17:33.011
Yes?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.178
I need to see
the following documents.

17:35.261 --> 17:37.094
They're listed
as permission only.

17:43.386 --> 17:45.595
I'm working for
the Central Committee.

17:57.470 --> 17:58.845
Comrade?

18:03.887 --> 18:05.595
(door opens)

18:18.511 --> 18:19.553
(door closes)

18:31.928 --> 18:33.386
(door opens)

18:37.011 --> 18:38.678
Agent:
She can have that one.

18:47.345 --> 18:49.178
Thank you, Comrade.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.803
(engines rumbling)

19:08.803 --> 19:10.928
(helicopters whirring)

19:32.762 --> 19:36.053
(muffled breathing)

20:21.136 --> 20:23.303
(voices murmuring)

20:27.219 --> 20:28.553
Man (over walkie-talkie):
All clear.

20:28.637 --> 20:31.053
Tarakanov:
Bring up the cameras.

20:31.136 --> 20:32.969
(buzzing)

20:35.136 --> 20:37.219
-Tarakanov: Signal?
-Jughashvili: Acceptable.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.219
Running onboard diagnostics.

20:39.303 --> 20:41.136
Tarakonov:
Tell me when we're
ready to move it.

20:41.219 --> 20:44.470
To think that's what
we put on the moon.

20:46.803 --> 20:48.511
Well, not that one.

20:50.303 --> 20:51.887
I know not that one.

20:51.969 --> 20:55.470
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

20:55.553 --> 20:57.845
That should cover
Nina and Katya.

20:58.803 --> 21:00.053
Shcherbina:
And Masha?

21:00.136 --> 21:02.219
Tarakanov:
The Central Committee
have informed me

21:02.303 --> 21:03.762
that they may have
found something

21:03.845 --> 21:06.428
that could work up there.
From the outside.

21:06.511 --> 21:08.219
American?

21:08.303 --> 21:10.219
(chuckling):
Of course not.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.011
It's a German
police robot.

21:12.094 --> 21:14.511
West German, so,
as you can imagine,

21:14.595 --> 21:16.969
that wasn't an easy
conversation to have.

21:17.053 --> 21:18.261
Diagnostics complete.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.845
Ready to engage
main power and motor.

21:21.511 --> 21:22.803
Tarakanov:
Begin.

21:28.845 --> 21:30.345
Can we move it?

21:32.053 --> 21:33.470
(controller clicks)

21:43.178 --> 21:46.011
Valery, what's that?
A smile?

21:47.553 --> 21:49.345
(Shcherbina laughing)

21:49.428 --> 21:51.595
(helicopters whirring outside)

21:59.470 --> 22:00.637
(knock at door)

22:00.720 --> 22:02.845
(door opens, closes)

22:05.136 --> 22:07.762
Khomyuk:
I see your condition has
improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

22:07.845 --> 22:09.386
No. Leave.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.511
I need your help.

22:26.969 --> 22:30.345
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

22:30.428 --> 22:33.136
-When you gave the order--
-Order? What order?

22:34.720 --> 22:37.887
Toptunov called it out,
Akimov pressed it.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.553
It was the only good
decision they made.

22:40.637 --> 22:42.219
Incompetent morons.

22:43.094 --> 22:46.136
Can you confirm that
the reactor exploded

22:46.219 --> 22:48.053
after they attempted
to shut it down?

22:49.053 --> 22:51.428
How do I even know
it exploded, huh?

22:56.053 --> 22:58.136
(papers rustling)

23:12.386 --> 23:14.969
I found this
in the state archive.

23:15.845 --> 23:17.887
Written in 1976.

23:17.969 --> 23:21.887
It's about the operation
of RBMK reactors
under extreme conditions.

23:21.969 --> 23:23.511
So?

23:23.595 --> 23:25.969
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

23:26.053 --> 23:28.178
and two pages
have been removed.

23:28.845 --> 23:32.219
Well, the State must protect
its secrets, Comrade.

23:32.303 --> 23:34.762
Do you dare
suggest otherwise?

23:34.845 --> 23:37.178
They made a mistake.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.845
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

23:52.803 --> 23:54.303
The missing pages
apparently refer

23:54.386 --> 23:58.303
to a positive void
coefficient and AZ-5.

23:59.219 --> 24:00.595
Does that mean
anything to you?

24:00.678 --> 24:03.094
What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

24:03.178 --> 24:05.470
You worked with the reactor.
You know it better than I do.

24:05.553 --> 24:08.637
So everything's
my fault, then?

24:08.720 --> 24:09.762
Is that what this is?

24:09.845 --> 24:11.345
I'm not here
to blame you.

24:11.428 --> 24:13.928
I'm here to find out
what happened.

24:14.011 --> 24:15.345
And whether you
realize it or not,

24:15.428 --> 24:17.678
I'm your best chance
to avoid a bullet.

24:20.345 --> 24:22.136
Can you help me or not?

24:30.511 --> 24:32.969
I have no idea what
would've gone here.

24:33.053 --> 24:36.094
Void coefficients have
nothing to do with AZ-5.

24:37.011 --> 24:39.011
There.
Now you can go.

24:39.094 --> 24:41.887
-You're not even curious?
-What for?

24:43.053 --> 24:46.386
You think the right question
will get you the truth? (scoffs)

24:47.553 --> 24:49.678
There is no truth.

24:49.762 --> 24:53.637
Ask the bosses
whatever you want
and you'll get the lie.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.053
And I will get the bullet.

25:00.887 --> 25:03.219
(door opens, closes)

25:11.720 --> 25:13.887
(truck rumbling)

26:06.428 --> 26:08.845
(rifle clicking)

26:29.136 --> 26:31.178
I only have two rules.

26:31.261 --> 26:32.803
One.

26:32.887 --> 26:35.887
Don't point this gun at me.
That's easy, right?

26:35.969 --> 26:37.887
You can point it
at this piece of shit.

26:37.969 --> 26:40.094
I don't give a fuck.
Never me.

26:40.178 --> 26:41.969
Two.

26:42.053 --> 26:45.428
If you hit an animal
and it doesn't die,

26:45.511 --> 26:48.219
keep shooting
until it does.

26:48.303 --> 26:52.303
Don't let them suffer,
or I'll kill you.

26:52.386 --> 26:54.595
Understand?

26:54.678 --> 26:56.011
I mean it.

26:57.011 --> 26:58.969
I've killed a lot of people.

27:03.969 --> 27:06.553
Good.
Then we're ready.

27:46.011 --> 27:49.511
Once we start, they'll run
inside where they feel safe.

27:49.595 --> 27:51.678
So we go
door-to-door.

27:52.928 --> 27:54.303
Okay?

27:54.386 --> 27:55.887
Good.

27:58.136 --> 28:00.261
(whistling)

28:02.094 --> 28:04.845
(distant dog barking)

28:04.928 --> 28:06.637
(panting)

28:09.845 --> 28:12.053
(whistling continues)

28:27.678 --> 28:29.386
-(gunshots echo)
-(dog yelps)

28:30.845 --> 28:32.637
(gunshots echoing)

28:34.928 --> 28:36.303
(panting)

28:37.678 --> 28:39.470
-(gunshot echoes)
-(dog whimpers)

28:46.011 --> 28:46.928
Hey!

28:47.011 --> 28:49.969
Do your job.
Door-to-door.

28:51.178 --> 28:52.928
(distant dogs barking)

29:06.094 --> 29:09.178
-(gunshots echoing)
-(dog barking)

29:27.678 --> 29:29.136
(distant gunshot echoes)

29:33.094 --> 29:35.428
(dog panting)

29:35.511 --> 29:36.595
(distant gunshot echoes)

29:36.678 --> 29:38.386
(panting)

29:43.803 --> 29:45.969
(muttering):
Go. Go.

29:46.053 --> 29:48.511
Go away. Go!

29:52.553 --> 29:54.678
(panting)

29:56.345 --> 29:58.678
-(barks)
-(gunshot echoes)

30:00.219 --> 30:02.053
(dog whimpering)

30:10.470 --> 30:12.219
(dog whimpering)

30:13.887 --> 30:15.261
(distant gunshot echoes)

30:18.928 --> 30:22.178
(dog panting, whimpering)

30:24.178 --> 30:25.887
(panting)

30:31.553 --> 30:32.678
(gunshot echoes)

30:44.511 --> 30:46.345
Don't let them suffer.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.386
Sorry. Sorry.

30:50.428 --> 30:52.928
Bacho:
You're dragging that
to the truck.

30:59.845 --> 31:01.428
(distant gunshot echoes)

31:21.261 --> 31:23.136
(flies buzzing)

31:29.928 --> 31:31.428
You gonna eat?

31:42.136 --> 31:43.470
Drink.

31:47.136 --> 31:48.470
Again.

32:00.595 --> 32:01.845
Look...

32:04.303 --> 32:06.637
This happens to everyone
their first time.

32:07.553 --> 32:09.928
Normally when
you kill a man.

32:11.470 --> 32:13.219
But for you, a dog.

32:13.303 --> 32:15.553
So what?
There's no shame in it.

32:17.678 --> 32:20.303
You remember
your first time, Garo?

32:20.386 --> 32:24.011
My first time--
Afghanistan.

32:26.053 --> 32:28.261
We were moving
through a house,

32:28.345 --> 32:32.345
and suddenly a man was there
and I shot him in the stomach.

32:34.136 --> 32:36.303
Yeah, that's
a real war story.

32:37.511 --> 32:39.720
They're never any good stories
like in the movies.

32:39.803 --> 32:41.386
They're shit.

32:42.053 --> 32:45.511
A man was there--
boom, stomach.

32:48.011 --> 32:49.969
I was so scared, I didn't
pull the trigger again

32:50.053 --> 32:51.845
for the rest of the day.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.887
I thought,
"Well, that's it, Bacho.

32:58.219 --> 33:00.470
"You put a bullet
in someone.

33:00.553 --> 33:02.803
"You're not you anymore.

33:02.887 --> 33:04.845
You'll never be you again."

33:07.386 --> 33:09.136
But then you wake up
the next morning,

33:09.219 --> 33:11.094
and you're still you.

33:12.178 --> 33:13.762
And you realize...

33:15.053 --> 33:17.511
that was you all along.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.428
You just didn't know.

33:29.845 --> 33:32.428
The happiness of all mankind.

33:36.053 --> 33:37.595
What?

33:38.720 --> 33:42.803
"Our goal is the happiness
of all mankind."

33:42.887 --> 33:44.261
(spits)

33:49.511 --> 33:50.762
Bacho:
Yeah.

33:55.553 --> 33:57.094
I'm happy.

33:57.178 --> 33:58.887
I'm happy every day.

34:01.261 --> 34:04.261
All right.
Back to work.

34:05.762 --> 34:07.053
Come on.

34:21.136 --> 34:24.178
(helicopters whirring overhead)

34:28.470 --> 34:30.678
(debris clattering)

34:47.303 --> 34:49.511
(helicopter whirring)

35:11.595 --> 35:14.011
(controllers clicking)

35:25.386 --> 35:26.720
Tarakanov:
It's here.

35:33.762 --> 35:35.845
(trucks rumbling)

35:55.511 --> 35:57.553
All right.

35:58.887 --> 36:00.261
Get over.

36:00.345 --> 36:02.428
Right. Hang on.

36:03.303 --> 36:05.345
Easy now. Careful.

36:06.053 --> 36:07.553
Hold it!

36:15.386 --> 36:16.678
Joker.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.803
It's what the Germans
named it: "Joker."

36:20.928 --> 36:23.928
-Is it ready?
-It's ready.

36:33.094 --> 36:35.261
(helicopter whirring)

36:50.762 --> 36:52.928
(clanking)

37:04.136 --> 37:06.178
(clicking)

37:11.136 --> 37:13.011
Jughashvili:
Good signal.

37:13.511 --> 37:15.094
Tarakanov:
Cameras.

37:16.345 --> 37:17.845
Motors.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.803
Motors, good.
Signals, good.

37:22.887 --> 37:25.428
All right,
let's take this easy.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.803
Forward one meter,
reverse one meter.

37:30.053 --> 37:31.345
Forward one.

37:35.303 --> 37:36.762
Germans.

37:38.219 --> 37:39.637
Reverse one.

37:45.928 --> 37:48.011
(buttons clacking)

37:52.969 --> 37:54.969
Did you lose the signal?

37:59.511 --> 38:01.511
It's not the signal.
It's the vehicle.

38:03.178 --> 38:04.637
It's dead.

38:10.637 --> 38:11.678
Shit.

38:16.470 --> 38:18.261
Of course I know
they're listening!

38:18.345 --> 38:20.428
I want them to hear!
I want them to hear it all!

38:20.511 --> 38:22.261
Shcherbina:
Do you know
what we're doing here?!

38:22.345 --> 38:25.011
Tell those geniuses
what they have done!

38:26.803 --> 38:28.887
Shcherbina:
I don't give a fuck!

38:30.762 --> 38:32.762
Tell them! Go tell them!
Ryzhkov!

38:32.845 --> 38:34.303
Go tell them he's a joke!

38:34.386 --> 38:35.969
Tell fucking Gorbachev!

38:36.053 --> 38:39.053
-Tell them!
-(phone jangling)

38:49.595 --> 38:51.720
(phone clanking)

39:00.303 --> 39:03.470
The official position
of the State

39:03.553 --> 39:05.762
is that a global
nuclear catastrophe

39:05.845 --> 39:08.178
is not possible
in the Soviet Union.

39:08.261 --> 39:12.803
They told the Germans
that the highest detected
level of radiation

39:12.887 --> 39:15.261
was 2,000 roentgen.

39:15.928 --> 39:18.261
They gave them
the propaganda number.

39:20.678 --> 39:23.053
That robot was
never going to work.

39:27.261 --> 39:28.928
We need a new phone.

39:44.386 --> 39:46.470
(rain pattering)

40:10.470 --> 40:12.428
What if we don't clear it?

40:12.511 --> 40:14.511
We have to clear it.

40:14.595 --> 40:18.595
Legasov:
If we don't clear the roof,
we can't build a cover over it.

40:20.511 --> 40:23.261
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

40:23.345 --> 40:27.762
That's nearly twice
the radiation from
the Hiroshima bomb.

40:27.845 --> 40:32.136
-Every hour, hour after--
-Shcherbina: I know,
I know, I know.

40:32.219 --> 40:34.178
What about lead?

40:35.511 --> 40:36.928
We could-- I don't know.

40:37.011 --> 40:40.094
We could melt it
and pour it from above,
like a coating.

40:40.178 --> 40:43.178
Tarakanov: First of all,
we've already used
most of the lead we had--

40:43.261 --> 40:45.428
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

40:45.511 --> 40:47.219
in the other
reactor buildings.

40:47.303 --> 40:50.178
The soldiers are stripping
it for their armor.

40:50.261 --> 40:52.011
Are you serious?

40:53.678 --> 40:56.720
(scoffs) Even if,
we're still talking about

40:56.803 --> 40:58.845
boiling metal
in a helicopter.

40:58.928 --> 41:01.553
And it's lead, Boris,
it'll weight a ton.

41:03.969 --> 41:06.969
What if we shoot
the graphite into the hole?

41:07.053 --> 41:09.928
We've got high-caliber bullets,
exploding bullets.

41:10.011 --> 41:12.219
-They wouldn't just
ricochet, they'd push--
-(Shcherbina scoffs)

41:12.303 --> 41:14.637
You wanna shoot
exploding bullets

41:14.720 --> 41:16.553
at an exposed
nuclear reactor?

41:16.637 --> 41:18.803
-Well...
-No, no.

41:18.887 --> 41:20.553
Let's go light that roof
back on fire.

41:20.637 --> 41:23.887
It was so easy
to put out the first time.

41:23.969 --> 41:27.511
(sighs)
What are
we talking about here?

41:29.094 --> 41:31.178
We need another robot.

41:32.053 --> 41:34.845
One that can withstand
the radiation.

41:34.928 --> 41:37.386
I've asked.
There is nothing.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.386
The Americans?

41:40.470 --> 41:42.345
If the Americans had
that kind of technology,

41:42.428 --> 41:44.219
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

41:44.303 --> 41:47.261
And even if they would,
the Central Committee
will never stoop to ask.

41:47.345 --> 41:49.053
You know it,
I know it.

41:50.178 --> 41:52.053
There are no robots.

41:58.511 --> 42:00.845
Legasov:
Biorobots.

42:00.928 --> 42:02.595
What was that?

42:03.969 --> 42:05.261
(clears throat)

42:07.094 --> 42:10.720
We use biorobots.

42:13.428 --> 42:14.803
Men.

42:30.928 --> 42:33.094
(distant gunshots echoing)

42:39.887 --> 42:41.969
(dog barking)

42:47.303 --> 42:49.345
(gunshot echoes)

42:53.720 --> 42:55.803
(dog barking)

42:59.136 --> 43:00.470
(distant gunshot echoes)

43:02.969 --> 43:04.303
(gunshot echoes)

43:10.261 --> 43:12.345
(dog growling)

43:15.303 --> 43:16.428
-(gunshot)
-(dog yelps)

43:16.511 --> 43:18.178
(dog whimpering)

43:20.386 --> 43:21.678
(gunshot echoes)

43:43.261 --> 43:44.678
A lot today.

43:49.845 --> 43:52.011
Where do they get their food?

43:54.011 --> 43:55.887
Bacho:
They eat the chickens.

43:56.553 --> 43:58.511
Then they eat each other.

44:09.303 --> 44:10.887
Door-to-door.

44:58.261 --> 45:00.386
(puppy yelps)

45:18.511 --> 45:21.595
(puppies growling, whining)

45:23.011 --> 45:25.136
Bacho:
Pavel?

45:29.428 --> 45:31.053
Bacho:
Pavel!

45:31.136 --> 45:33.303
(footsteps ascending stairs)

45:39.303 --> 45:42.470
You don't hear me?
I'm talking to you.

45:44.511 --> 45:46.094
Fuck.

45:50.887 --> 45:52.678
Just go outside.

45:52.762 --> 45:55.803
(puppies whining, growling)

45:59.136 --> 46:00.511
Go.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.303
(puppies barking)

46:23.470 --> 46:25.511
(exhales)

46:31.595 --> 46:35.178
-(gunshots echoing)
-(sighs)

46:57.720 --> 46:59.845
(gunshots continue)

47:31.887 --> 47:35.219
(man singing
somber Russian song)

47:56.428 --> 47:59.136
(somber song continuing)

48:18.261 --> 48:21.969
(song continuing)

48:40.470 --> 48:42.595
(song fades)

48:48.386 --> 48:50.470
(truck rumbling)

48:53.969 --> 48:55.637
Tarakanov:
Comrade soldiers,

48:55.720 --> 48:58.428
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

48:58.511 --> 49:00.094
They want us to clean this up,

49:00.178 --> 49:02.845
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

49:02.928 --> 49:05.219
Because of the nature
of the working area,

49:05.303 --> 49:09.261
you will each have
no more than 90 seconds
to solve this problem.

49:09.345 --> 49:12.219
Listen carefully to each
of my instructions,

49:12.303 --> 49:14.762
and do exactly as
you have been told.

49:14.845 --> 49:19.511
This is for your
own safety and the safety
of your comrades.

49:19.595 --> 49:21.887
You will enter
Reactor Building Three,

49:21.969 --> 49:25.720
climb the stairs
but do not immediately
proceed to the roof.

49:25.803 --> 49:27.803
When you get to the top,
wait inside,

49:27.887 --> 49:30.887
behind the entrance
to the roof
and catch your breath.

49:30.969 --> 49:33.511
You will need it
for what comes next.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.637
This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.

49:36.720 --> 49:40.219
Some of it is in blocks,
weighing approximately
40 to 50 kilograms.

49:40.303 --> 49:42.428
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

49:42.511 --> 49:46.428
Watch your comrades moving
fast from this opening,

49:46.511 --> 49:48.094
then turning to the left,

49:48.178 --> 49:50.303
and entering the workspace here.

49:50.386 --> 49:52.011
Take care not to stumble.

49:52.094 --> 49:55.595
There's a hole in the roof.
Take care not to fall.

49:55.678 --> 50:00.386
You will need to move quickly,
and you will need
to move carefully.

50:00.470 --> 50:03.011
Do you understand your mission
as I have described it?

50:03.094 --> 50:04.969
Soldiers:
Yes, Comrade General.

50:05.053 --> 50:08.470
Tarakanov:
These are the most important
90 of your lives.

50:08.553 --> 50:11.969
Commit your task to memory,
then do your job.

50:18.011 --> 50:20.803
(dosimeters clicking)

50:36.261 --> 50:39.053
(metal clanging)

50:54.969 --> 50:57.887
It's time to go.
After 90 seconds,
I will ring a bell.

50:57.969 --> 51:00.094
When you hear it,
return immediately,

51:00.178 --> 51:01.470
drop your shovels in the bin,

51:01.553 --> 51:04.136
and proceed down the hallway
for decontamination.

51:04.219 --> 51:05.928
Above all,
while on the roof,

51:06.011 --> 51:07.470
throw your debris
over the rail.

51:07.553 --> 51:09.303
Do not look over the rail.
Is that clear?

51:10.637 --> 51:12.011
Very well.

51:12.094 --> 51:14.637
On my mark.
Ready. Go.

51:17.969 --> 51:20.178
-(muffled breathing)
-(dosimeters clicking)

51:23.928 --> 51:26.011
(muffled panting)

51:38.928 --> 51:41.887
(clicking grows louder)

51:44.511 --> 51:47.011
(muffled grunting)

51:56.178 --> 51:59.345
(dosimeters crackling loudly)

52:08.136 --> 52:10.011
(grunts)

52:23.386 --> 52:25.511
(both panting)

52:46.470 --> 52:48.553
(alarm clanging)

52:54.053 --> 52:56.011
Whoa!

52:58.887 --> 53:01.136
-(clanging continues)
-(dosimeter crackling)

53:01.219 --> 53:03.720
(panting)

53:03.803 --> 53:05.595
(grunts)

53:07.762 --> 53:09.470
(yelps)

53:20.219 --> 53:22.428
(panting)

53:27.553 --> 53:28.637
Comrade soldier.

53:30.428 --> 53:31.928
You're done.

53:34.386 --> 53:36.470
(dosimeter clicking)

53:43.053 --> 53:45.219
(sighs)
Time to go.

53:45.303 --> 53:47.470
(children chattering)

53:58.136 --> 54:00.595
Oh! Your glove!

54:03.553 --> 54:06.261
(gasps, labored breathing)

54:09.762 --> 54:11.595
(moaning)

54:14.928 --> 54:17.011
(moaning continues)

54:20.470 --> 54:21.928
Mommy! Mommy!

54:36.303 --> 54:38.386
(truck rumbling)

55:26.428 --> 55:28.678
Shcherbina:
I'm sorry for all this.

55:28.762 --> 55:32.428
But we needed to speak
to you somewhere without...

55:32.511 --> 55:35.428
Legasov:
They're going to put
Dyatlov on trial,

55:35.511 --> 55:37.803
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

55:37.887 --> 55:41.803
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

55:41.887 --> 55:43.386
all three of us.

55:43.470 --> 55:45.969
But that's--
Before that happens--

55:46.053 --> 55:49.511
The Central Committee is
sending Legasov to Vienna.

55:49.595 --> 55:51.553
It's the headquarters
of the International--

55:51.637 --> 55:55.053
Atomic Energy Agency.
Yeah, I know what's in Vienna.

55:56.845 --> 55:58.511
What are they
asking you to do?

55:58.595 --> 56:01.637
Tell the world
what happened.

56:06.261 --> 56:08.595
Well, then you better
know what happened.

56:08.678 --> 56:10.637
I've constructed
a timeline,

56:10.720 --> 56:12.303
minute by minute.

56:12.386 --> 56:15.470
Second by second
in some places.

56:15.553 --> 56:17.345
Every decision,
every button push,

56:17.428 --> 56:19.511
every turn of a switch.

56:19.595 --> 56:22.470
And? Are they guilty?

56:22.553 --> 56:23.928
Yes.

56:24.011 --> 56:28.011
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

56:28.094 --> 56:30.261
recklessness beyond belief.

56:30.345 --> 56:32.928
But the explosion?
I'm not sure.

56:33.011 --> 56:35.345
What do you mean
you're not sure?

56:36.178 --> 56:38.261
I've analyzed the data.

56:38.345 --> 56:40.511
Toptunov was telling the truth.

56:40.595 --> 56:43.969
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

56:45.386 --> 56:48.762
I think this article
my have the answer,

56:48.845 --> 56:52.303
but two pages
have been removed.

56:57.845 --> 56:59.720
You've seen this before.

56:59.803 --> 57:02.553
Please, believe me
when I tell you that

57:02.637 --> 57:05.053
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

57:05.136 --> 57:08.136
-None of us knew.
-None of you knew what?

57:09.428 --> 57:12.428
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

57:12.511 --> 57:14.845
a fuel channel ruptured.

57:14.928 --> 57:16.720
The operators pressed AZ-5,

57:16.803 --> 57:19.553
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

57:19.637 --> 57:22.511
for a brief moment
it went up.

57:22.595 --> 57:24.345
How is that possible?

57:24.428 --> 57:25.803
Well, this was
the very question posed

57:25.887 --> 57:27.803
by a colleague of mine
named Volkov.

57:27.887 --> 57:29.845
He's the one who
wrote this article.

57:29.928 --> 57:33.678
When an RBMK reactor
runs at low power,
it's notoriously unstable.

57:33.762 --> 57:37.094
Prone to swings
in reactivity.

57:37.178 --> 57:38.595
Under normal circumstances,

57:38.678 --> 57:40.511
the control rods can
compensate for that.

57:40.595 --> 57:41.969
Under normal circumstances.

57:42.053 --> 57:45.511
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

57:45.595 --> 57:47.428
They pulled almost
all the control rods out

57:47.511 --> 57:51.345
-to bring the power back up.
-This is what Volkov learned
from Leningrad.

57:51.428 --> 57:52.845
If the boron control rods

57:52.928 --> 57:55.637
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

57:55.720 --> 57:57.011
when they're put back in,

57:57.094 --> 58:00.219
the first thing that enters
the core isn't boron.

58:00.303 --> 58:02.511
It's graphite.

58:05.678 --> 58:07.928
The control rods
have graphite tips

58:08.011 --> 58:10.428
that displace
water and steam.

58:10.511 --> 58:12.845
So the reactivity
doesn't go down.

58:12.928 --> 58:15.011
It goes up dramatically.

58:15.094 --> 58:18.470
(scoffs)
Why on Earth would
they press that button?

58:18.553 --> 58:20.553
They didn't know.

58:22.386 --> 58:25.011
Legasov:
Volkov warned
the Kremlin,

58:25.094 --> 58:26.845
ten years ago.

58:27.595 --> 58:30.136
(sighs)
But there could
be no doubt

58:30.219 --> 58:34.094
about the supremacy of
the Soviet nuclear industry.

58:34.178 --> 58:36.011
Ah.

58:36.094 --> 58:39.762
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

58:42.011 --> 58:43.511
Legasov:
When I saw the reactor
blown open,

58:43.595 --> 58:47.053
I still didn't think it could
be this flaw in AZ-5.

58:47.136 --> 58:50.178
Because the flaw will not
lead to an explosion

58:50.261 --> 58:55.428
unless the operators
have pushed the reactor
to the edge of disaster.

58:55.511 --> 58:58.345
-So it is their fault?
-Yes.

58:58.428 --> 59:00.470
But not only
their fault.

59:01.887 --> 59:03.386
No.

59:04.511 --> 59:07.094
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

59:08.803 --> 59:09.928
(sighs)

59:10.011 --> 59:13.011
You can't possibly
be that naive.

59:13.094 --> 59:16.511
There are 16 RBMK reactors

59:16.595 --> 59:19.386
running in the Soviet Union
right now.

59:19.470 --> 59:21.428
We have to fix them.

59:21.511 --> 59:24.219
The only way to do that
is to go public,

59:24.303 --> 59:26.303
force the Central Committee
to take action.

59:26.386 --> 59:29.386
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

59:29.470 --> 59:32.470
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

59:32.553 --> 59:35.011
We can make a deal
with the KGB.

59:35.094 --> 59:37.178
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna,

59:37.261 --> 59:40.386
and they quietly let us fix
the remaining reactors.

59:40.470 --> 59:42.803
A deal with the KGB?

59:42.887 --> 59:44.595
And I'm "naive."

59:45.845 --> 59:49.303
Shcherbina:
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

59:49.386 --> 59:52.219
Khomyuk:
You have a chance to talk
to the world, Valery.

59:52.303 --> 59:54.178
If that chance was mine--

59:54.261 --> 59:55.928
But it isn't, is it?

59:57.178 --> 1:00:00.303
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

1:00:00.386 --> 1:00:02.553
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

1:00:02.637 --> 1:00:06.762
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

1:00:06.845 --> 1:00:09.470
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

1:00:09.553 --> 1:00:11.678
It leaves you.

1:00:11.762 --> 1:00:16.303
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

1:00:20.345 --> 1:00:22.720
Do you know the name
Vasily Ignatenko?

1:00:22.803 --> 1:00:24.345
No.

1:00:25.678 --> 1:00:28.428
He was a fireman.

1:00:28.511 --> 1:00:31.595
He died two weeks
after the accident.

1:00:31.678 --> 1:00:34.553
I've been looking in
on his widow.

1:00:34.637 --> 1:00:36.428
She gave birth.

1:00:36.511 --> 1:00:37.928
A girl.

1:00:38.011 --> 1:00:40.303
The baby lived
for four hours.

1:00:41.219 --> 1:00:43.345
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

1:00:43.428 --> 1:00:46.094
but the baby
absorbed it instead.

1:00:46.178 --> 1:00:47.595
Her baby.

1:00:49.178 --> 1:00:50.720
We live in a country

1:00:50.803 --> 1:00:53.511
where children have to die
to save their mothers.

1:00:54.762 --> 1:00:56.887
To hell with your deal.

1:00:58.887 --> 1:01:01.219
And to hell with our lives.

1:01:02.803 --> 1:01:05.053
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

1:01:19.219 --> 1:01:21.595
Tarakanov:
Congratulations, comrades.

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:25.219
You are the last of 3,828 men.

1:01:25.303 --> 1:01:27.969
You have performed
your duties perfectly.

1:01:28.053 --> 1:01:30.470
I wish you good health
and long life.

1:01:30.553 --> 1:01:33.428
All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 rubles.

1:01:33.511 --> 1:01:35.261
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:35.345 --> 1:01:37.178
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:37.261 --> 1:01:38.928
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:39.011 --> 1:01:40.762
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:40.845 --> 1:01:42.762
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:42.845 --> 1:01:44.511
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:44.595 --> 1:01:46.094
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:46.178 --> 1:01:47.428
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:01:47.511 --> 1:01:49.678
-Thank you.
-I serve the Soviet Union.

1:02:23.637 --> 1:02:25.762
(infants crying)

1:05:48.386 --> 1:05:49.969
JUDGE: This session of court
is now open.

1:05:51.011 --> 1:05:53.094
The state calls Comrade Khomyuk.

1:05:54.011 --> 1:05:55.678
ULANA KHOMYUK: To understand
what happened that night,

1:05:55.762 --> 1:05:58.053
we have to go back
to the first critical moment.

1:05:58.845 --> 1:06:00.386
The time is 28 past midnight.

1:06:03.678 --> 1:06:06.345
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:08.511
MAN: 1:22 a.m.

1:06:08.928 --> 1:06:10.553
Once it's over,
we will have our villains.

1:06:11.053 --> 1:06:13.637
We will have our hero.
We will have our truth.

1:06:14.178 --> 1:06:16.720
MAN: 1:23 and 35 seconds.

1:06:16.928 --> 1:06:18.928
JUDGE: Comrade Boris Shcherbina.

1:06:19.470 --> 1:06:22.386
It began with... a safety test.

1:06:22.637 --> 1:06:24.386
-MAN: 1:23:42.
-(ALARMS BEEP)

1:06:25.219 --> 1:06:28.637
KHOMYUK: They died rescuing
each other. Putting out fires.

1:06:29.511 --> 1:06:30.678
-Tending to the wounded.
-(BEEPING CONTINUES)

1:06:30.887 --> 1:06:32.470
MAN: 1:23:45.

1:06:32.553 --> 1:06:34.386
KHOMYUK:
When your testimony arrives,

1:06:35.303 --> 1:06:36.511
insist on reform.

1:06:36.928 --> 1:06:38.678
-I've already given my life.
-(BEEPING ACCELERATES)

1:06:39.136 --> 1:06:41.094
-Isn't that enough?
-(BEEPING ENDS)

1:06:41.303 --> 1:06:43.386
JUDGE:
The state calls Comrade Legasov.
