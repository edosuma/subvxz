WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:08.380
(Distant train horn)

00:08.509 --> 00:10.340
(Birds chirping)

00:22.815 --> 00:26.478
(Jim) They used to call Snooks Eaglin
"the human jukebox".

00:26.611 --> 00:30.103
Harley must have been
human jukebox 2.0.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.857
There wasn't a folk, country, Celtic,

00:33.993 --> 00:37.360
bluegrass, acoustic blues
that he didn't know.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.487
He was a bloody encyclopedia.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.453
I'd see him around town,
say hello for years.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.705
And, uh...

00:45.838 --> 00:47.703
and then...

00:47.840 --> 00:51.549
he'd just disappear for weeks or months.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.089
And...then suddenly he'd be back

00:54.222 --> 00:56.713
from New York or...

00:56.849 --> 00:59.431
the UK or Prague or...

00:59.560 --> 01:02.723
Fiji or somewhere.

01:02.855 --> 01:06.894
I don't know how he ever got where he went,
because he never had any money, right?

01:07.026 --> 01:10.018
- (Woman) Right.
— l was playing at the Apple Barrel one night

01:10.154 --> 01:13.237
and this dude was
out on the banquette yodeling, man.

01:13.366 --> 01:14.731
(Laughter)

01:14.867 --> 01:17.904
I had to stick my head out and say,
"Brah, have mercy."

01:18.037 --> 01:21.529
I said, "You sound like the loup—garou
and you look like him too."

01:21.666 --> 01:24.078
- (Laughter)
— He said, "Well, you're one to talk."

01:25.086 --> 01:28.203
And we were good friends ever since —
a beautiful thing.

01:30.633 --> 01:33.170
Sister Annie, would you come fonNard, please?

01:36.514 --> 01:38.675
Thank you all so much for coming.

01:41.394 --> 01:43.009
Listening to everyone,

01:43.145 --> 01:45.477
I realize we all loved Harley

01:45.606 --> 01:48.814
and none of us really
knew much about him...

01:51.279 --> 01:55.568
..where he came from, who his family was,
if he had a family.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.399
He...

01:58.536 --> 02:03.075
He would always just shrug off
any kind of personal question.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.333
He lived in the moment.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.794
And he lived for music...

02:10.923 --> 02:14.336
just all day, every day.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.377
He was always broke...

02:18.514 --> 02:19.469
(Laughter)

02:19.598 --> 02:22.180
..but never beat.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.017
l—l never saw him down, ever.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.471
He would say,

02:29.483 --> 02:31.599
"I'm too blessed to be stressed."

02:33.195 --> 02:35.652
You know, I'd be blue about something

02:35.781 --> 02:37.646
and Harley would say,

02:37.783 --> 02:40.490
"Darlin', life is short.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.952
"Let's play a song."

02:49.295 --> 02:53.538
J‘ l was standing

02:53.674 --> 02:57.041
J‘ By my window

02:57.803 --> 03:00.465
J‘ On a dark

03:00.598 --> 03:05.137
J‘ And cloudy day

03:06.187 --> 03:10.305
J‘ When I saw the...

03:10.441 --> 03:14.605
J‘ Hearse wheel rollin'

03:14.737 --> 03:16.944
J‘ It was takin'

03:17.073 --> 03:19.109
J‘ My brother

03:19.241 --> 03:21.027
J‘ Away

03:22.745 --> 03:26.829
J‘ I said to the...

03:26.957 --> 03:30.870
J‘ Undertaker

03:31.003 --> 03:34.086
J‘ Won't you please

03:34.215 --> 03:39.426
J‘ Drive real slow?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.966
J‘ That's my brother

03:43.099 --> 03:47.559
J‘ My old friend Harley

03:47.686 --> 03:55.604
J‘ Lord, I sure hate to see him go

03:56.195 --> 04:00.108
J‘ Can the circle

04:00.241 --> 04:04.234
J‘ Be unbroken?

04:04.370 --> 04:07.487
J‘ By and by, Lord

04:07.623 --> 04:10.660
J‘ By and by

04:12.711 --> 04:16.624
J‘ There's a better

04:16.757 --> 04:20.716
J‘ Home awaiting

04:20.845 --> 04:23.882
J‘ In the sky, Lord

04:24.014 --> 04:28.849
J‘ In the sky J‘

06:20.464 --> 06:22.295
— .380?
— Both of them.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.966
Couldn't have been us, then.
We carry Glocks, .40 cal.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.177
You never heard
of a throwdown piece?

06:28.305 --> 06:31.092
I heard of it, but I never
had cause to use one.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.932
Your witness has actually seen
police shoot these guys?

06:34.061 --> 06:36.222
- No.
— There you are.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.597
Were you at Robideaux's
a week after the storm?

06:39.733 --> 06:43.476
Hell yeah. We all were, all week, in and out.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.818
lberville too.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.815
We chased a few knuckleheads,
but we didn't kill them. We caught them.

06:48.951 --> 06:52.114
One of your officers was fired on
in the Robideaux's parking lot.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.113
First District? You sure?

06:55.249 --> 06:57.331
Rifle—fire, hit his car.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.165
Where did you hear that at?

06:59.295 --> 07:01.661
A reliable source.

07:01.797 --> 07:06.006
I don't recall hearing anything like that,
nothing at all, nothing.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.376
Thank you, Officer Wilson.
You've been a wonderful help.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.346
Protect and serve.
You have a good day, hear?

07:15.686 --> 07:18.268
Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.978
(Scoffs)

07:24.987 --> 07:26.443
You OK?

07:27.656 --> 07:30.363
I think it was just about perfect.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.028
— Don't you?
— Yeah.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.488
Maybe we should, uh...
do a proper memorial,

07:37.625 --> 07:40.412
an evening somewhere,
all-star tribute.

07:41.629 --> 07:45.872
I don't know.
Harley wasn't a venue musician.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.794
He didn't even like playing clubs.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.962
Yeah, you're right.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.962
Maybe we should go hear some music.

07:54.099 --> 07:57.216
— (Church bells ringing)
— Busman's holiday.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.180
Maybe.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.428
— Hey.
— Hey.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.055
Jim, thank you for coming.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.774
I wouldn't have missed it.
Well, I might have.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.859
I missed my dad's funeral by a week.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.439
What's this?

08:11.575 --> 08:13.156
The keys to Harley's flat.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.989
There's no rush. Isn't the rent paid
till the end of the month?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.864
I've got to fuck off
back to London tomorrow.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.707
Somebody's got to do
something with his stuff.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.463
_ (People chattering)
- (Phones ringing)

08:29.510 --> 08:32.217
- Calderon.
— How are you making it, Lieutenant?

08:33.305 --> 08:35.421
Anything on that Central City double?

08:35.557 --> 08:37.388
I got a call in to Narcotics,

08:37.518 --> 08:39.304
see what they know
about the dead guys.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.643
You think we're losing
the war on drugs, Detective?

08:41.772 --> 08:44.388
- Give me your candid opinion.
— Well, I got a line on a witness.

08:44.525 --> 08:48.234
An older lady called it in. I'll pass by and talk to
her tomorrow when she gets home from work.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.943
Why not tonight?

08:50.072 --> 08:52.529
I'm working a detail — Liuzza's.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.617
Prioleau, how many detail hours
you work in a week?

08:56.745 --> 08:59.077
15, 20.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.950
Relax, Lieutenant. I'll talk to the lady.

09:06.839 --> 09:10.377
Detective Silby, in my office, please.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.501
- (Phone rings)
— (Woman) Homicide.

09:15.681 --> 09:16.966
Mr. Batiste.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.965
You were good this morning.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.933
You're really progressing,
you know that?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.302
Thanks.

09:23.439 --> 09:26.226
You played in a band, right,
when you were our age?

09:26.358 --> 09:29.896
Back then it was, uh, Danny Barker's
Fairview Baptist Church Band.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.612
- Mr. Batiste.
— OK, what's on your mind? Spit it out.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.606
You play on the streets?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.950
I played everywhere — barbecues,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.239
bar mitzvahs, birthday parties.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.988
— Not the clubs. Too young for the clubs.
— Mm.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.583
— You enjoy that the other night?
— Yeah.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.249
— (Laughs) Sneaking in to hear me play?
— Yeah.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.919
| used to do that too.
You didn't tell your mama, did you?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.552
- No.
— Good.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.339
She might not understand.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.430
We want to do that —
me, Denard and Charles and them.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.220
We want to play on the street
like the Baby Boyz.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.762
Uh—huh.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.978
Can you help us?

10:11.153 --> 10:14.145
(Colson) How do you expect to solve this case
if you don't work it?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.647
I got 12 other active cases, Lieutenant,

10:16.784 --> 10:18.365
with leads.

10:18.494 --> 10:20.200
I mean, I'll be honest with you,

10:20.329 --> 10:21.910
this one stalled out a little.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.530
I mean, he was a street musician.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.622
Your point?

10:27.711 --> 10:30.168
They were walking in the Marigny, late.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.255
He said something
after he handed over his wallet.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.216
He should have kept his mouth shut.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.927
He had it coming?
Is that what you're saying?

10:39.056 --> 10:42.344
(Sighs) That's not what I'm saying.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.933
Silby, do you work any outside details?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.393
I got a couple.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.854
Ever interfere with your police work?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.439
I don't think so, sir.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.071
Go talk to the woman again...

10:58.200 --> 10:59.610
this Ann Talarico.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.949
Yes, sir.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.625
(Playing funky jazz music)

11:52.129 --> 11:54.040
(Davis plays solo)

12:00.554 --> 12:01.760
(Band stops playing)

12:01.889 --> 12:03.720
— Fuck! God!
— (Man) Fucking Davis.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.682
What?! It was just getting good to me, man.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.266
— Yeah, to you maybe.
— (Laughter)

12:08.395 --> 12:11.478
- Shit.
— What? All right, let's start again from the top.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.472
— Ready?
— (Knocks)

12:13.609 --> 12:15.565
(Man) Alex, what's up?

12:15.694 --> 12:18.686
- Fellas.
— (Man) Oh, what's up?

12:18.822 --> 12:22.155
What's going on?
What's happening, Davis?

12:22.284 --> 12:25.401
Uh, we're just rehearsing.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.075
Heard you outside. I was passing by,
had my guitar, thought maybe I could sit in.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.196
Is that cool?

12:30.334 --> 12:32.950
- Well, yeah, sure.
— Cool with you guys?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.623
- Brassy Knoll.
— Yeah, take this. Take this here.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.289
— l'll unplug it. Good.
- (Men) Yeah, Alex!

12:38.425 --> 12:41.292
You, uh... You need to tune up or...?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.589
— I'm already in tune.
- (Men) Oh.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.928
All right.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.968
(Lil Calliope) Already tuned.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.965
(Chuckles) All right.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.594
(Strikes four times)

12:51.730 --> 12:54.437
(Playing funkyjazz)

13:09.539 --> 13:12.372
(Alex playing solo)

13:35.941 --> 13:37.397
24 on the meter, dawg.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.642
A'ight.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.402
Twenty,

13:42.531 --> 13:46.365
one, two, three, four,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.279
and one for you.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.653
What happened? Somebody die?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.575
(Chuckles)

13:52.708 --> 13:53.993
(Laughs)

14:05.387 --> 14:06.797
— Hey, LaDonna.
— Hey.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.763
— Glad I caught you here.
— Oh, I had a meeting.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.268
With the suit—and—tie man
just walked out of here?

14:12.394 --> 14:14.180
— What did he want?
— Mm—hm.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.563
Oh.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.857
A realtor.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.065
— Y'all moving back home?
— I'm selling the bar.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.060
— What? Why?
— None of your goddamn business.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.188
Man, I'm not prying.
No need to bite my head off.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.948
| just came by here to make you whole
on the child support.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.574
— You're welcome.
— Oh!

14:37.711 --> 14:40.794
I'm supposed to thank you now for something
you owe every damn month?

14:43.133 --> 14:46.591
Mm, all the times you was late with it
and I let you slide.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.085
| always paid, didn't I?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.007
Not as much as me.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.058
What's wrong with you?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.431
You.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.187
Me?

15:00.317 --> 15:04.401
I should have known the first time
I laid eyes on you shiftless motherfucker

15:04.529 --> 15:07.362
— with a horn and a hat cocked just right.
- Oh, that again, huh?

15:07.491 --> 15:09.903
— That's right. Uh—uh.
— Oh, you haven't buried that shit yet?

15:10.035 --> 15:13.493
- I did what I could do, LaDonna.
— Yeah, and look what I got to show for it, huh?

15:13.622 --> 15:16.284
Shithole of a bar, debt, babies.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.122
— You must be drunk.
- Oh, I'm fixing to be.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.869
You love this bar. I can't believe you're
selling it, but I had nothing to do with this bar.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.963
This is your family's. It's been fucking
people up since before I was born.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.048
Forget about it, Antoine, OK? Just forget it.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.792
And them babies that I gave you,

15:28.929 --> 15:31.045
they are our beautiful sons.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.797
Now, you got a good man, professional.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.799
The troubles that we had, our breakup,

15:35.936 --> 15:38.393
that led to what you got right now,
but you can't see that.

15:38.522 --> 15:42.936
— That's a solid—gold silver lining, baby.
— Shit! Goddamn fucking musicians!

15:43.068 --> 15:44.649
(Muttering) Goddamn musicians, man.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.861
You are irrational.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.443
(Elevator dings)

15:51.576 --> 15:53.692
You're never gonna make
a dime on this, you know.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.241
You're the one who told me
a New Orleans record would sell.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.362
Modestly.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.115
And that expectation of a razor—thin profit

16:00.252 --> 16:04.245
was predicated upon four days in the studio,
not four weeks,

16:04.381 --> 16:07.464
or picking up and moving everything
to New Orleans. Coffee, regular.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.334
He won't do it nowhere else.
He's already down there waiting for us.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.133
He went down there for
St. Joseph's Super Sunday and stayed.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.803
Back to the money,
I'm gonna have to ask you to borrow some.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.391
Because?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.512
To pay my daddy and tell him
it's an advance on the royalties.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.014
I thought I just explained
there won't be any royalties.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.860
There will never be any royalties.
This record will be in the red for fucking ever.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.853
I understand that.
That's why I'm asking you.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.527
I'm not gonna get it
from the record company.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.405
This is a good idea.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.703
Jon Cleary?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.701
- Duh.
—(Laughs)

16:44.838 --> 16:47.250
Good. You're enjoying it?

16:47.382 --> 16:49.498
He's fantastic.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.625
Good. Good.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.756
I'm worried about you.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.347
You're so calm.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.395
l... lshould be...

17:07.527 --> 17:10.109
hysterical, weepy?

17:10.238 --> 17:12.775
No, um, ljust mean

17:12.908 --> 17:15.445
you're sort of stoic.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.863
I think you're...

17:17.996 --> 17:19.987
in shock or...

17:20.123 --> 17:21.909
denial or something.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.910
Davis...

17:27.047 --> 17:28.628
— I'm OK.
- OK.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.293
I'm just...

17:31.259 --> 17:33.045
— I'm just all cried out, that's all.
— OK.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.133
- OK?
— All right.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.843
I'm all right, really.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.552
— Hey, Annie. Hey, Davis.
— (Davis) Hey, man.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.890
- Hey, Jon.
— Good stuff, man.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.600
— Where you at? Where you at?
- It's all good.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.017
All right, listen, I'm sorry to hear about Harley.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.481
Um... Shall I do...
Do you want me to do something for him?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.601
Have you got a special request?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.570
— You choose.
— Yeah? Alrighty. All right.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.563
(Davis) Thanks, man.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.692
— (Applause)
— Um, I'm gonna do a little...

17:58.828 --> 18:01.490
a little tune for a special friend of ours.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.989
This one's called Frenchmen Street Blues.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.126
J‘ Sprinkle my ashes on Frenchmen Street

18:16.471 --> 18:18.507
J‘ Don't be upset

18:18.640 --> 18:20.926
J‘ At the news

18:25.063 --> 18:27.224
J‘ Don't cut me loose

18:27.357 --> 18:29.439
J‘ With a soulful song

18:31.111 --> 18:32.772
J‘ And don't play

18:32.904 --> 18:36.067
J‘ No Frenchmen Street blues

18:43.456 --> 18:47.620
J‘ Hitch me ridin' on a river breeze

18:50.088 --> 18:54.081
J‘ To Elysian Fields so green

18:59.556 --> 19:04.676
J‘ And I'll join the spirits looking down to smile

19:06.021 --> 19:10.890
J‘ On the backstreets of ol' New Orleans... J‘

19:15.947 --> 19:17.448
Wilson's pretty clean —

19:17.574 --> 19:21.442
no sustained complaints
for brutality or misconduct,

19:21.578 --> 19:24.035
a number of commendations.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.123
The week after the storm Saint Francis
could've fallen off the rails.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.583
What about the white cop — Harvin?

19:30.712 --> 19:34.705
Still trying to track him. He quit the force
after the storm, left town.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.421
We need to see the Homicide files
on these cases,

19:39.554 --> 19:41.135
see what their story is,

19:41.264 --> 19:43.300
what's in there, what's not.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.718
I don't follow you.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.557
It's the cover—up that does them in.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.019
Shootings like these
are usually ruled justifiable —

19:50.148 --> 19:52.935
split—second decisions, imminent threat.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.935
They're allowed to use lethal force.
Comes with the job.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.608
All they really have to do is say,
"I thought he had a gun."

19:58.740 --> 20:02.107
But if they try to cover it up,
you can get them on perjury, obstruction.

20:02.243 --> 20:06.361
So why did they lie if all they had to do
was get their story straight?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.614
Maybe just because they can.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.457
Bad cops lie all the time,
even when they don't have to —

20:11.586 --> 20:14.123
a habit.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.125
(Helicopter overhead)

20:17.258 --> 20:20.546
— Afternoon.
— What can I do for you?

20:20.678 --> 20:22.760
— I left a card the other day.
- (Scoffs)

20:22.889 --> 20:25.301
You're the one going door to door
buying up properties.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.934
— Offering top dollar.
— Yeah?

20:27.060 --> 20:30.143
Fair market value. Now your house...

20:30.271 --> 20:32.523
you've obviously done work to it — a new roof.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.435
Your house being in such
good shape and all,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.148
I'll give you a great price.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.984
— You making many deals?
— By and large.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.526
A few don't want to sell.
Can't blame them.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.523
They're fools.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.072
- Excuse me?
— Anyone can see something's up.

20:46.204 --> 20:50.618
You not buying up all this property
just to turn around and rent it out again,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.706
not in this neighborhood.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.128
— Y—You look familiar.
— | play.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.623
Yeah, blues guitar, right?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.920
I've seen you. You're good.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.918
I'm not rich, but I get by.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.047
My life savings -
you're looking at it.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.766
So? Interested?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.762
Come on in.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.020
Everything's so different since the storm.
ldon't know, I...

21:19.654 --> 21:22.612
..feel like the ground
has just eroded under my feet.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.115
— I don't know where I am these days.
— Mm.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.031
I think everyone in the city
still feels that way —

21:29.164 --> 21:32.156
anxious, displaced.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.785
Now Larry wants me to sell the bar.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.375
It makes sense after what happened.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.297
From his point of view.

21:45.430 --> 21:50.220
And it would be entirely understandable
if you felt that way too.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.102
I know he wants what's best for me.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.765
The bar represents independence,

21:58.902 --> 22:00.517
a link to your past,

22:00.653 --> 22:02.268
your sense of place.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.861
It's all I got...

22:04.908 --> 22:06.569
besides my family.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.871
You resent him for insisting
on selling the bar?

22:21.341 --> 22:24.799
Have you resumed relations
with your husband?

22:34.437 --> 22:36.849
(J‘ I Thought I Heard New Orleans Say)

22:57.794 --> 22:59.785
— (Annie) Hey.
— Hey.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.377
How are you?

23:01.506 --> 23:03.167
I'm OK.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.675
How are you?

23:04.801 --> 23:06.086
All right.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.174
Really?

23:07.303 --> 23:08.679
(Sighs)

23:08.805 --> 23:10.591
Yeah, really.

23:11.474 --> 23:16.184
Everyone is treating me like I'm a china doll,
but I am OK.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.142
You playing somewhere?

23:20.275 --> 23:22.732
Harley loaned me these
so I could gig.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.191
You should just keep them.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.311
Ah, that's what Davis said.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.439
Exactly. Everything's goodwill bound.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.613
We'll just take the mangy stuff down to Jimmy
at the music exchange

23:32.745 --> 23:34.201
and get, like, 15 bucks for it.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.867
So you might as well hold on to it.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.584
Maybe I'll keep the guitar
for a couple of weeks.

23:41.713 --> 23:45.376
| just bought a used Vibrolux
at Magazine Pawn, so I'm good there.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.045
You still doing that
soul revue with Antoine?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.713
Yeah, it's going OK.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.838
It must be, if you're buying
your own equipment.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.260
I've been working a job—job too

23:55.393 --> 23:58.430
couple times a week —
oyster boat, Pointe a la Hache.

23:58.563 --> 23:59.973
Oyster boat?

24:00.106 --> 24:02.313
That's, like, manual labor.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.979
(Chuckles) Yeah, it is. No doubt.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.227
(Davis) Well, good on you, brah.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.740
— All right, good?
- Mm-hm.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.666
I should be able to get this back to you
by next month.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.495
Sonny.

24:26.841 --> 24:30.629
Uh... Tork and I played the Ogden

24:30.762 --> 24:32.252
back in December.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.095
There was an exhibit of storm photos

24:35.224 --> 24:36.760
and you were there.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.055
The Ogden? You're kidding.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.849
Yeah, um...

24:41.981 --> 24:46.850
you were pulling people
out of an attic in the Lower Nine.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.147
There was a baby.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.987
The caption said Deslonde Street.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.401
I told you about that.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.912
Yeah, I know you did.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.620
It's no big deal.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.707
It looked like a deal to me.

25:08.966 --> 25:13.335
Anyway, I don't know if the exhibit is still up,
but I thought you'd want to know.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.218
Thanks.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.958
(J‘ Band playing Crumpled Paper)

26:01.477 --> 26:02.853
The bear claws are fresh.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.721
The croissants are a day old,
so knock a dollar off those.

26:05.857 --> 26:07.939
I'm gonna run to the corner,
get some milk.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.273
OK.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.280
— Very nice.
— Thanks.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.037
- Thank you.
— You're welcome.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.001
(I They All Asked For You)

26:32.133 --> 26:33.794
Ah, you're killing me with this.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.791
— Shut up. It's my favorite part.
- (Laughs)

26:41.434 --> 26:45.222
Ah, these rice—flour waffles
are a nice touch.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.140
Chicken and waffles, I'm guessing?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.434
— Gooch, come here. Check this out.
— On your back.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.307
Got chicken and waffles, bitches.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.648
Oh.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.491
— Whoa, that's fucked up.
— (Chuckles)

27:00.620 --> 27:02.201
In a really good way.
What's the sauce?

27:02.330 --> 27:03.945
It's kind of a reverse vinaigrette.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.821
The proportions are, like, inverted.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.040
lt's rice—wine vinegar,
a little grape—seed oil,

27:08.169 --> 27:12.503
and it's just loaded up with bird's—eye chillies,
garlic, ginger, a little soy.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.872
It's good, huh?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.999
Oh. I'm telling you right now,

27:16.135 --> 27:17.511
Dave is gonna love this.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.969
Dave is gonna get a huge stiffy over this.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.884
This... This is right in Dave's happy place.

27:23.017 --> 27:26.054
Well done, gator. Looks like we're gonna have
a happy Dave today, uh?

27:26.187 --> 27:28.052
— Hey yo, food's up.
- Oh.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.056
Let there be joy in the streets and frolicking.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.818
Jesus Christ, Toni.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.612
l'm barely in the door.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.823
I need to see those files, Terry.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.574
It's an open investigation.
There's no way. You know that.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.747
And I know there's nothing going to happen
with those investigations.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.623
Witnesses have been intimidated.
Evidence disappeared.

27:56.759 --> 28:00.377
Between the Fifth District and the First,
it never made it to Homicide.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.219
You sure about that?

28:03.850 --> 28:07.308
Detective Prioleau —
Abreu was his case.

28:07.436 --> 28:11.600
He lied to the family about
where their son died and how.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.599
- He intimidated a witness.
— Who won't come fonNard.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.896
Not till we see how this plays out, Terry.

28:19.949 --> 28:22.110
.380 casings, same as Abreu,

28:22.243 --> 28:25.576
were found in the lberville apartment
where Seals was shot.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.787
— Found when?
- Recently.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.075
So where are they?

28:29.208 --> 28:32.746
They been turned over to the detective
in charge of that case - Calderon?

28:32.879 --> 28:34.961
I didn't think that was prudent.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.498
I don't want them to go missing too.

28:38.634 --> 28:42.422
I need your help, Terry.
I need to see a copy of those files.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.473
Will you at least look at them

28:47.602 --> 28:50.969
and then look me in the eye and tell me
you think there's nothing going on?

28:55.818 --> 28:57.604
I'm not making any promises.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.164
Will you pass the salt, please, Grandma?

29:16.297 --> 29:18.754
I already salted everything.

29:18.883 --> 29:21.795
You sure? Doesn't taste like it.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.135
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.640
Then why'd you put it on the table?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.757
I don't know. Habit.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.009
Wait a minute. What'd ljust say?

29:31.145 --> 29:33.056
Don't you hand him that salt.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.396
You want him to have
hypertension like Daddy?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.604
Sorry.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.202
— (LaDonna slams salt—shaker down)
— See what you did?

29:59.340 --> 30:01.331
(J‘ Fiddle playing)

30:19.360 --> 30:21.351
That's sweet.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.193
What comes next?

30:23.322 --> 30:25.859
l have no idea. That's all he wrote.

30:27.785 --> 30:30.777
Maybe you should finish some of them.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.619
I'm thinking about it.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.498
(J‘ Band playing Zydeco)

30:36.627 --> 30:38.913
J‘ Pickin' it up

30:39.714 --> 30:40.954
J‘ Pickin' it up

30:41.799 --> 30:46.293
J‘ Pickin' it up, pickin' it up

30:46.429 --> 30:49.717
J‘ Now Papi got some pills
in his dresser drawer

30:49.849 --> 30:52.556
J‘ He won't tell nobody what they're for

30:52.685 --> 30:55.677
J‘ When he take one,
wait a little while

30:55.813 --> 30:59.021
J‘ He creeping off to bed
with a big old smile... J‘

31:01.068 --> 31:03.024
(Hidalgo) She's hot. I like this.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.394
Whoo!

31:04.530 --> 31:05.940
Bowl a little, dance a little.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.483
— The night is young.
- (Laughs)

31:07.616 --> 31:09.652
— Honey, there's a lane open.
— Well, you go ahead.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.571
We'll catch up in a minute.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.955
I closed on a couple more houses.
Still half a dozen holdouts.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.497
Not our problem.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.837
I can keep going back.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.082
Let the city and state
worry about the refuseniks.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.800
Ah, they're the end users.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.716
They'll make us an offer,
a very fair offer.

31:31.849 --> 31:36.684
Correct me if I'm wrong. Public hearings,
land use, neighborhood organizations,

31:36.812 --> 31:39.064
concerned citizens, preservationists?

31:39.190 --> 31:40.896
Yeah, that'll come.

31:41.025 --> 31:44.813
— And there'll be a fight, a big one.
- But it's already a done deal.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.901
Transparency has its place.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.363
But this is for the good of the city.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.285
J‘ Now, them little pills, the color blue

31:54.413 --> 31:57.325
J‘ And when you ask him what they do

31:57.458 --> 32:00.325
J‘ When it's down,
| tell you what

32:00.461 --> 32:03.624
J‘ Them little pills really pick you up... J‘

32:35.704 --> 32:37.695
(Chatter)

32:49.385 --> 32:55.130
I've, uh... I've been working in New York
with Jon Batiste, as a matter of fact, yeah.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.723
Yeah, yeah, well,
we're not related, though.

32:57.852 --> 32:58.762
Really?

32:58.894 --> 33:02.512
People always thinking that we're related,
but we're not. That's a misconception.

33:02.648 --> 33:07.312
He uses two Ts in his name.
I use three Ts in my name.

33:07.444 --> 33:10.936
Now, that that's all settled,
I'll go get Harold some gumbo.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.906
— Anybody else?
- No, we're fine.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.320
— Miss Leah.
- Albert.

33:16.453 --> 33:20.241
What do you think? You think
they're gonna tear down the Lafitte or not?

33:20.374 --> 33:24.083
I do not talk politics
on Holy Thursday, sweetheart.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.543
- Yes, ma'am.
— Another day.

33:27.173 --> 33:30.381
The fried chicken is good,
but definitely gumbo today.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.374
— Toni.
— Well, Judge.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.547
And who is this lovely young lady?

33:34.680 --> 33:38.218
This is Alison Myers. She's interning with me
while she studies for her bar.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.387
— Bernard Williams. Nice to meet you.
— Thank you.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.351
— You been here before?
— Never.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.436
— She's from California.
— Ah.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.433
Holy Thursday at Dooky Chase,
gumbo z'herbes —

33:48.569 --> 33:50.810
one of New Orleans' sacred institutions.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.653
— Seems like you guys got a lot of those.
— (They laugh)

33:53.782 --> 33:57.491
Indeed. This one is particularly auspicious,
first since the storm.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.736
It's quite a turnout.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.079
You know who's not here this year?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.324
— Pampy Barre.
— Of course.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.496
Uh, businessman, ex—cop.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.244
(Bernard) Bagman to the stars.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.881
The Feds have Pampy.

34:10.007 --> 34:14.000
And he'd flip on his mama if he thought
it would take one day off his sentence.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.797
Who's in the crosshairs?

34:15.930 --> 34:17.295
Everybody.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.467
Rumor is they even went in
over the weekend

34:19.600 --> 34:21.636
and seized a bunch of files
from City Council.

34:24.355 --> 34:26.471
(Toni) Oliver?
(Bernard) No, no, no.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.144
Haven't heard his name at all.
I'd be surprised.

34:29.276 --> 34:32.063
Morgue said these were sent over
after DMORT closed.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.902
- (Siren whoops)
- (Police radio chatter)

34:34.031 --> 34:36.488
There was a bunch — 25, 30 cases.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.403
Detectives never picked up their evidence.

34:38.535 --> 34:40.787
Oh, Jesus.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.619
Well, you know how it was after the storm.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.080
That's always the default excuse, isn't it?

34:45.209 --> 34:47.916
The storm, the storm, the storm.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.036
You're welcome to take a look.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.875
(Distant siren wailing)

35:07.273 --> 35:09.355
- (J‘ The True)
— (Sighs) Sorry I'm late.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.984
— Hey.
— What's up, man?

35:11.110 --> 35:13.146
So, uh, what's up with this?

35:13.279 --> 35:16.191
Trying a remix.
Got a couple ideas.

35:16.323 --> 35:19.030
Oh, all right.
So what's this all about?

35:19.159 --> 35:20.695
You said it was urgent.

35:20.828 --> 35:25.242
I called you to preapprove
the new amps and mics, OK?

35:25.374 --> 35:28.457
It went straight to voicemail.
You didn't get the message?

35:28.585 --> 35:31.748
We're gonna talk about that AmEx bill later.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.496
Oh, OK. So?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.373
(Sighs)

35:36.510 --> 35:39.092
We need to delay the release of the sampler.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.337
— It's a couple of weeks.
— Why?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.304
— You're listening to it.
- This?

35:43.434 --> 35:46.767
The True? On the sampler?

35:46.895 --> 35:48.760
Can't put that bitch out without it.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.898
OK, yeah.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.484
No, it makes sense.

35:55.612 --> 35:58.069
Thing is, we add The True...

35:58.198 --> 35:59.654
something got to go.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.695
— Yeah, I agree.
— You do?

36:06.540 --> 36:07.871
Oh, no.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.332
Wait, no. No, no, no, no.

36:10.461 --> 36:13.669
— Davis, you have two tracks.
— And they're both brilliant.

36:13.797 --> 36:18.712
They could break out too, just like The True.
They... They both have universal appeal.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.677
They... Fuck!

36:21.805 --> 36:23.761
One got to go.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.472
You have to choose, darling.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.057
(Chatting quietly)

36:31.982 --> 36:33.722
(Chuckling) Good luck, brah.

36:45.621 --> 36:46.986
Thank you.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.499
You should come hear me play sometime.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.085
You ever play New Orleans East, Versailles?

36:55.214 --> 36:56.545
No.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.585
Uptown, Seventh Ward, Eighth Ward.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.670
Never happen, huh?

37:07.309 --> 37:10.676
First things first — how do I...date you?

37:10.813 --> 37:12.178
You don't,

37:12.314 --> 37:14.430
unless my father says you can.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.397
Will you ask him?

37:16.527 --> 37:18.358
(Laughs) No.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.441
You don't want to date me?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.985
I don't want to ask him.
You have to ask him.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.446
So you do want to date me?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.910
If he says it's OK.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.030
But I have to ask him.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.827
Does he speak English?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.791
When he wants to.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.535
If he doesn't?

37:36.672 --> 37:38.503
Means he doesn't like you.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.007
You don't want that to happen.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.057
— Bay leaves, Chef.
— Thanks.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.925
Hey, these pig dinners...

37:52.062 --> 37:56.522
they've been selling really well every week,
a week in advance.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.515
I'm gonna go balls—out on all that,

37:58.652 --> 38:00.688
regular service, basically everything.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.655
But look, I've been really happy
with what you've been doing lately.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.775
And I was really impressed with that staff meal
you cooked the other day.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.448
It was insanely delicious.

38:10.581 --> 38:13.163
Chinese fried chicken and waffles.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.123
Crazy. It was awesome.

38:15.252 --> 38:18.460
— Thank you.
— Wait, I got another crazy idea.

38:18.589 --> 38:22.252
So I was thinking maybe to give you a chance
to cook your own special dinner,

38:22.384 --> 38:25.922
late—night affair after service,
like this pig dinner...

38:26.054 --> 38:27.760
Once a week. What do you think?

38:27.890 --> 38:30.256
— For real?
— Yeah, but like southern food,

38:30.392 --> 38:32.132
New Orleans food.

38:32.269 --> 38:34.931
Do your own take on it,
our own take on it.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.725
Just make it delicious
like that fucking fried chicken.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.064
You willing to do it?

38:39.193 --> 38:40.933
- Hell yeah.
— All right, gator.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.275
(She laughs)

38:42.404 --> 38:44.440
(Cab door closes)

38:44.573 --> 38:47.406
- Say, brah.
— What's up, chief?

38:47.534 --> 38:50.150
Man, do you ever give lessons? Kids?

38:50.287 --> 38:51.868
Been known to. Why?

38:51.997 --> 38:55.615
I got this student, you know,
may have some promise.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.959
He could use a little, uh, extra help

38:59.087 --> 39:01.043
from a trumpet player.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.915
— Got to meet him.
- Right.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.258
— And his folks.
- Of course.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.344
And I don't give lessons.
I get paid for teaching.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.338
Oh, I hear that.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.511
All right.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.259
I'll get back to you.

39:15.395 --> 39:16.976
All right.

39:20.317 --> 39:23.434
The FBI? Not Oliver's office.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.947
It would've happened over the weekend.

39:26.073 --> 39:29.031
Mom, I was in and out of the fucking files
all day Monday.

39:29.159 --> 39:31.150
Watch your language.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.665
How are things at the coffee shop?

39:39.586 --> 39:40.917
Fine.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.253
I'm almost a fully certified barista.

39:43.382 --> 39:44.497
Next stop, Starbucks.

39:44.633 --> 39:45.998
Your attitude...

39:48.095 --> 39:50.131
I hope you're taking this seriously.

39:50.264 --> 39:52.255
lam.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.092
You know, just because
you've got a good attorney

39:56.228 --> 39:58.935
and an expensive therapist
and your mother is a lawyer...

39:59.064 --> 40:01.646
I know, I know.
You're spending tons of money.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.142
And just because you're an overprivileged
middle—class kid

40:05.279 --> 40:08.066
— who goes to a good school...
— Overprivileged white kid.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.610
Don't forget that one.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.992
White kid, yes.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.781
— It doesn't mean you can't fuck this up.
- I'm taking it seriously, OK?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.908
I actually kind of like thejob.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.418
You do?

40:23.547 --> 40:25.208
The cafe's cool.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.422
Musicians hang out, play music.

40:27.551 --> 40:30.588
I'm even learning how to do
those little leaf designs

40:30.721 --> 40:32.757
on every handcrafted latte.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.971
Now you are being sarcastic again.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.089
I'm not.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.806
Seriously, it's...it's kind of cool.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.803
(Knocking on door)

40:43.108 --> 40:45.064
Just a minute.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.323
I didn't find anything.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.168
I'm sorry.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.342
Terry.

41:21.605 --> 41:29.819
J‘ Mm, me and Mrs. Jones J‘

41:29.946 --> 41:32.232
(Cheering)

41:33.909 --> 41:35.945
Yeah.

41:36.078 --> 41:37.443
Yes.

41:37.579 --> 41:40.412
All right now, ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to feature

41:40.540 --> 41:43.407
the vocal stylings of the legendary

41:43.543 --> 41:45.124
Wanda Rouzan, ladies and gentlemen.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.834
- (Cheering)
— Where y'all at?

41:50.717 --> 41:55.632
J‘Ooh... J‘

41:55.764 --> 41:58.130
(Antoine) Ooh, is right. What's that?

41:58.266 --> 42:03.226
J‘ Oh, it's...

42:03.355 --> 42:06.847
J‘ Been such a long, long time... J‘

42:06.983 --> 42:08.974
Entirely too long, baby.

42:09.111 --> 42:12.820
J‘ Looked like I got you off of my mind... J‘

42:12.948 --> 42:14.404
- No, you can't.
— J‘ But I can't... J‘

42:14.533 --> 42:16.524
No, you can't.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.247
J‘ Just the thought of you... J‘

42:21.373 --> 42:23.238
Make your knees weak, huh?

42:23.375 --> 42:26.833
J‘ Turns my whole world

42:26.962 --> 42:28.418
J‘ Misty blue... J‘

42:28.547 --> 42:30.412
I know it do. I know it do.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.540
J‘ Oh, hon

42:34.136 --> 42:38.300
J‘ Just the mention of your name... J‘

42:38.432 --> 42:40.889
— Antoine Batiste, gangster of love.
- (Cheering)

42:41.017 --> 42:42.928
J‘ Turns a flicker to a flame... J‘

42:43.061 --> 42:44.847
Burn, baby, burn.

42:44.980 --> 42:48.893
— J‘ Listen to me good, baby... J‘
— I'm listening. What you got to say?

42:49.025 --> 42:53.610
J‘ I think of the things we used to do... J‘

42:53.739 --> 42:58.779
— All night long, X—rated.
— J‘ Turns my whole world misty blue... J‘

42:58.910 --> 43:00.025
Come on, baby.

43:00.162 --> 43:02.824
- J‘ Ohh... J‘
— Oh! Boom.

43:03.707 --> 43:06.289
Wear it out! Tear it up!

43:06.418 --> 43:07.874
J‘ I should forget you... J‘

43:08.003 --> 43:09.994
You ain't gonna never forget this.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.580
J‘ Heaven knows I've tried... J‘

43:13.717 --> 43:15.332
You ain't tried hard enough.

43:15.469 --> 43:16.504
(Laughter)

43:16.636 --> 43:18.172
— J‘ Baby... J‘
— What?

43:18.305 --> 43:20.796
— J‘ Baby, baby... J‘
— What? What, baby?

43:20.932 --> 43:25.096
J‘ When I say that I'm glad
we're through... J‘

43:25.228 --> 43:27.719
— Yeah, lay it on me, mama.
— I meant it!

43:27.856 --> 43:30.097
You ain't nothing but a scene—stealing,

43:30.233 --> 43:33.316
conniving, no playing, no singing,

43:33.445 --> 43:36.733
pussy—faced, pious motherfucker.

43:36.865 --> 43:38.446
— (Crowd shouting)
- Now, bitch.

43:38.575 --> 43:40.190
Where you think you're going?

43:40.327 --> 43:42.318
I quit!

43:44.164 --> 43:47.031
In the middle of a gig?
I'm—a fine your ass.

43:47.167 --> 43:48.577
(Wanda) Yeah, you do that.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.575
(Patrons laughing, jeering)

43:50.712 --> 43:53.294
- Now what, man?
— Play that intro again.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.539
You know, fuck that.
She thinks she irreplaceable?

43:55.675 --> 43:58.508
You gonna sing it? Please don't.

43:58.637 --> 44:02.471
No, no, no, let him sing it.
Gonna fine him for every sour note he sings.

44:02.599 --> 44:04.305
Ladies and gentlemen, plan B.

44:04.434 --> 44:07.892
— Plan B?
— Play the damn song.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.185
Here we go.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.276
J‘Oh

44:20.408 --> 44:24.868
J‘Oh oh oh oh oh oh

44:26.289 --> 44:27.404
J‘ Baby

44:29.626 --> 44:32.538
J‘ It's been such a long, long time

44:35.924 --> 44:39.212
J‘ Oh, I can't get you out my mind

44:41.012 --> 44:42.513
J‘ And I can't... J‘

44:42.639 --> 44:44.925
(Colson) The files were sanitized.

44:45.058 --> 44:47.094
— You know what I mean?
— Mm—hm.

44:47.227 --> 44:49.309
Like they'd barely worked the cases —

44:49.437 --> 44:50.973
no forensics, no ballistics,

44:51.106 --> 44:53.222
not even evidence submission slips
from the morgue.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.815
— In a homicide?
- I know, right?

44:55.944 --> 44:57.309
So I...

44:59.197 --> 45:02.064
I went to temporary central evidence.

45:03.743 --> 45:06.075
And there it all was...

45:06.204 --> 45:11.665
all of Seals's stuff, all of Abreu's,
everything in heaps and piles.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.499
It was a mess,

45:13.628 --> 45:17.212
the clothes they were wearing,
the bullets that killed them,

45:17.340 --> 45:19.251
just rotting away.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.761
Devil's advocate, Terry,
if this is a cover-up...

45:24.890 --> 45:27.302
I'm not saying that it was.

45:27.434 --> 45:30.267
..why didn't the detectives go to the morgue,

45:30.395 --> 45:34.638
pick up their evidence, make it go missing
like the Abreu casings?

45:34.774 --> 45:39.484
Because autopsies were at St. Gabriel
after the storm.

45:39.613 --> 45:41.069
So maybe...

45:42.282 --> 45:45.024
maybe they just didn't bother to drive
all the way out there.

45:45.160 --> 45:48.323
With everything that was going on,
all the confusion...

45:48.455 --> 45:49.444
who's to know?

45:49.581 --> 45:51.788
Exactly. They blew them off,

45:51.917 --> 45:54.909
wrote some half—assed reports
and closed the cases.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.756
Yeah, you're right.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.169
That's probably how it went down.

46:09.017 --> 46:10.882
You know anybody
who might want to fill in,

46:11.019 --> 46:12.975
for one night even?

46:13.104 --> 46:16.187
My new girlfriend sings a little.

46:16.316 --> 46:17.897
Would she be interested?

46:18.026 --> 46:20.312
Maybe a couple of gigs.

46:20.445 --> 46:23.278
She's kind of a serious student — lawyer.

46:23.406 --> 46:24.737
What's she doing with you?

46:24.866 --> 46:27.073
(Laughs) You really wanna know?

46:27.202 --> 46:28.317
No.

46:30.246 --> 46:31.861
She know any songs?

46:31.998 --> 46:34.580
I could teach her a few
between now and then.

46:34.709 --> 46:37.792
Maybe we can manage a rehearsal,
the day of.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.879
No, man, she ain't got time for that, brah.

46:41.508 --> 46:43.840
- Oh, really?
— Say, brah, she'll be fine.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.927
- You'll see.
— Ain't even in the band.

46:47.055 --> 46:50.422
Ain't even a professional musician,
already giving me grief.

46:50.558 --> 46:52.344
I...swan.

— Wow.
— Now, that's what I'm talking about.

47:54.914 --> 47:56.996
— Sounded good, Daddy.
- Yeah, you right.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.161
— That was fantastic, Albert.
— (Man) Damn good take.

47:59.294 --> 48:02.377
— You ready to move on?
— Give me a minute. Be right back.

48:03.631 --> 48:06.043
Want to turn that camera off, baby?

48:07.302 --> 48:08.462
(Door closes)

48:08.595 --> 48:10.426
He's happy?

48:10.555 --> 48:12.841
Didn't that sound the same
as the one we cut in New York?

48:12.974 --> 48:16.307
(Dr John) I hate to disagree with your ass,
but I'm with your pa on that shit.

48:16.436 --> 48:18.552
Where the hell else are you gonna get

48:18.688 --> 48:22.556
the legendary Uganda Roberts
to play on your session?

48:22.692 --> 48:24.307
Thank you, Mac.

48:24.444 --> 48:26.605
Hold on now.
I wanted to bring Uganda up to New York.

48:26.738 --> 48:29.775
You know, New Orleans infect music.

48:29.908 --> 48:32.695
It reconstutionalates it.

48:32.827 --> 48:36.069
I'm not tryin' to be no jivenocity sucker,

48:36.206 --> 48:39.448
but I'll tell you what, it matters the difference.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.667
Can you dig it?

48:42.796 --> 48:45.208
Amen to that.

48:46.049 --> 48:47.289
I'm outnumbered. Shit.

48:48.593 --> 48:51.335
(Albert) All right, come on now. Let's do it.

(Albert laughing)

48:53.932 --> 48:57.675
— (On radio: J‘ Iggy Pop: The Passenger)
— I cook the grits in ramen broth,

48:57.811 --> 48:59.426
black pepper, a little soy,

48:59.562 --> 49:01.473
stir in some butter.

49:02.899 --> 49:04.480
Got your soft—boiled egg.

49:09.823 --> 49:13.031
And your shrimp,
which you sear and press.

49:21.084 --> 49:23.291
Then you got your bacon crumble.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.627
And your charred scallion.

49:32.554 --> 49:34.385
And there it is — shrimp and grits.

49:34.514 --> 49:36.425
Hope you like it.

49:44.065 --> 49:46.306
Try that, Gooch. It's delicious.

49:53.032 --> 49:54.442
She's good.

J‘ Hey, the power... J‘

(On radio:
J‘ Althea & Donna: Uptown Top Ranking)

51:19.953 --> 51:21.784
Hey, Chef. Hey, it's Donald Link.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.699
Oh my God. I know who you are.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.571
Donald Link, you're one of my heroes.

51:25.708 --> 51:28.916
— Hey, good to see you. Great work.
— Thank you so much. Thank you.

51:29.045 --> 51:30.455
We miss you in New Orleans.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.499
Oh, thank you.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.873
Well, I know you're busy.
I just wanted to say hi.

51:35.009 --> 51:37.546
- It was nice meeting you.
— You too. Have a great night.

51:44.769 --> 51:46.555
Yo, boss.

51:46.688 --> 51:48.098
You forgot to tell me Wanda quit

51:48.231 --> 51:50.392
and you replaced her with some hottie
with a big booty?

51:50.525 --> 51:53.267
Her booty had nothing to do with it.
Girl works with Toni Bernette.

51:53.403 --> 51:55.268
She's a law student, Cornell's girlfriend.

51:55.405 --> 51:58.772
— You didn't offer her a gig with the band?
- It was an emergency, one night only.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.773
I didn't offer that girl no regular gig.

52:00.910 --> 52:02.525
She was begging me.

52:02.662 --> 52:05.574
And I told her I need a woman, not some girl,
to sing these songs.

52:05.707 --> 52:08.369
I've been meaning to ask -
how come all you sing is cheating songs?

52:08.501 --> 52:10.787
You know, 'cause I gotta give the public
what they want,

52:10.920 --> 52:13.662
you know, what you call,
you know, a stage persona.

52:13.798 --> 52:15.459
You dawgin' around on me again?

52:15.591 --> 52:16.876
Only onstage.

52:17.010 --> 52:19.877
— If I find out you are...
— Oh, come on.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.308
J‘ Look out, Daddy

52:24.434 --> 52:26.174

J‘ By the way I look

52:39.907 --> 52:43.775
J‘ I won't be wandering no more J‘

52:48.458 --> 52:49.994
You guys sound great.

52:50.126 --> 52:52.117
(Woman) Thank you.
(Men) Thanks.

53:04.432 --> 53:06.718
Is it OK if we leave our stuff in here
forjust a minute?

53:06.851 --> 53:08.637
- Sure.
— All right.

53:08.770 --> 53:13.434
We were gonna go out back
and smoke some weed if you want to join us.

53:13.566 --> 53:17.024
Oh, um, what about your stuff?

53:17.153 --> 53:22.193
Can't you just stick a sign on the door
or something — "Back in five"?

53:24.535 --> 53:26.116
I'd better not.

53:28.998 --> 53:30.738
OK.

53:52.021 --> 53:53.932
"This machine floats."

53:56.943 --> 53:58.808
That is so Harley.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.649
Pete and Woody were his heroes.

54:06.786 --> 54:11.371
I liked Kingston Trio
and Peter, Paul and Mary.

54:11.499 --> 54:15.333
I used to play Leaving On A Jet Plane
just to annoy him.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.710
I hope you'll take that.

54:24.804 --> 54:26.294
You don't mind?

54:26.431 --> 54:28.217
Of course not.

54:28.349 --> 54:31.011
We gave most of his things to goodwill.

54:31.144 --> 54:33.635
You know, if I had known that
you were coming, I would've...

54:33.771 --> 54:36.478
If you'd known I existed, you mean.

54:38.985 --> 54:41.442
Harley never talked about his family.

54:42.655 --> 54:45.442
Yeah, well, that would be me at this point.

54:46.242 --> 54:49.154
And I apologize again
for dropping in like this.

54:49.287 --> 54:52.074
The detective, he only gave me your address.

54:52.206 --> 54:56.165
He was never much for biography

54:56.294 --> 54:57.955
or possessions.

54:58.087 --> 55:00.078
I'm surprised he had a roof over his head.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.296
(Case locks click)

55:05.094 --> 55:07.301
I should go.

55:10.766 --> 55:13.052
cremation in the morning,

55:13.186 --> 55:15.893
flying him on the red eye.

55:16.772 --> 55:20.014
I hope I don't have trouble
getting his ashes through security.

55:20.151 --> 55:23.439
(Sighs) Sounds like one of his songs.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.695
You know, there were a few other things.

55:28.868 --> 55:31.575
You keep them.

55:32.663 --> 55:34.039
OK.

55:37.460 --> 55:39.792
Anyway, I'll see you next year,

55:39.921 --> 55:42.583
Mardi Gras, if you're still here.

55:42.715 --> 55:46.503
He wanted his ashes scattered
on the Mississippi —

55:46.636 --> 55:47.967
some parade.

55:48.971 --> 55:51.348
— St. Anne's.
— St. Anne's.

55:54.101 --> 55:56.228
He was a tremendous songwriter.

55:57.396 --> 55:58.852
I learned so much from him.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.812
(Chuckles) Honestly, though, I...

56:00.942 --> 56:03.479
I couldn't stand his singing.

56:03.611 --> 56:06.193
That phony Texas twang. (Exhales)

56:06.322 --> 56:08.563
— What do you mean?
— Oh, what'd he tell you,

56:08.699 --> 56:11.987
he was from Austin
or Lubbock or San Antone?

56:12.119 --> 56:13.734
Waco.

56:14.705 --> 56:17.242
Complete affectation.

56:17.375 --> 56:19.491
We grew up in Bellingham, Washington.

56:38.271 --> 56:40.262
(Larry panting)

56:43.401 --> 56:45.392
Why'd you stop?

56:48.072 --> 56:50.063
Thought you wanted to.

56:51.492 --> 56:53.483
I thought you did.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.489
You didn't seem like you...

57:00.668 --> 57:02.454
was really into it.

57:07.300 --> 57:09.882
We just out of practice, that's all.
