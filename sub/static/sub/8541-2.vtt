Hello.

[Danny]
'Hey, boy wonder.'

00:37.298 --> 00:38.995
'Guess what
I'm holding in my hand.'

00:39.082 --> 00:40.127
Danny?

00:40.214 --> 00:42.172
'The one and only.'

00:42.259 --> 00:43.565
'So how you doing?'

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
Good. I'm good.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.569
It's been a long time.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.657
How are you?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.746
Yeah. Good. Good.

00:50.833 --> 00:55.446
Listen, I, uh..

00:55.533 --> 00:59.146

'Turn around.'

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237
Hey, guys.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.980
It's not what it looks like.

01:52.808 --> 01:53.983
[chuckles]

01:57.160 --> 01:59.554
[theme music]

02:09.346 --> 02:10.304
No, no, no, y-you're going

02:10.391 --> 02:11.566
about it all wrong, detective.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.307
You...you're coming
straight out

02:13.394 --> 02:15.135
of the gate with bad cop.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.527
I mean, you do a good bad cop.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.094
You are intimidating,
I'm not gonna

02:18.181 --> 02:19.400
not gonna lie
to you but, but, now

02:19.487 --> 02:20.531
let's bring good cop out.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.403
He's nicer,
more pleasant.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.013
We build a rapport.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.580
You...maybe,
you say something like

02:25.667 --> 02:28.583
"are you thirsty?" and I say,
"I'd love a cup of tea."

02:28.670 --> 02:30.498
Here's another
fine mess, eh?

02:30.585 --> 02:31.934
They really found Jane
holding the murder weapon?

02:32.021 --> 02:33.196
Yes, they did.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.024
Hightower twisted
some arms at Sac PD.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.244
It's a joint investigation,
we share the sandbox

02:37.331 --> 02:39.724
but CBI is taking the lead.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.465
I don't know
why you're smiling.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.119
Well, it's a new angle
at least, right?

02:43.206 --> 02:45.904
I mean, he's never been
a murder suspect before.

02:45.991 --> 02:46.992
We got an ID
on the victim.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.646
Landon Wale, 45.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.866
He's some real estate
mogul from San Francisco.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.259
What was he doing
in Sacramento?

02:52.346 --> 02:54.217
Well, office is
a financial brokerage.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.871
K-Ram Investments Inc.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.873
Van Pelt's trying
to locate the owner.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.831
What's Jane say
he was doing?

02:59.918 --> 03:02.356
I-I was taking a walk
and...to get some air.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.314
And when I came by here,
I heard a shot.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.708
So, uh, I came to see
if I could help

03:06.795 --> 03:09.014
and that's when
I discovered this man

03:09.101 --> 03:11.452
lying here with
the blood and...and no pulse.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.584
He had the gun in his hand.

03:13.671 --> 03:17.022
Yes, I confess,
I-I picked it up.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.589
I'm not good
with forensics.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.983
No, I can vouch for that.
He is, uh, terrible.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.594
You heard a gunshot
and ran in to help?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.596
Yes, I did. I'm no hero.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.033
I just did what any person
would do in that situation.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.036
No one is calling
you a hero.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.560
Really? Good.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.780
Detective, how'd your guys
catch this? 911?

03:35.867 --> 03:37.869
Yeah, uh, an anonymous call

03:37.956 --> 03:40.829
said a man was murdered
at this location.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.222
Did you make
that call, Jane?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.789
No. Why would I do that?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.791
[Rigsby]
'Hang on, boss.'

03:46.878 --> 03:48.880
This was stuck
in his pocket.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.621
Looks like a ruby.

03:50.708 --> 03:54.364
A pretty nice one.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.409
Cool.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.758
Yeah, great.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.281
Detective.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.371
Could you uncuff
this one now, please?

04:01.458 --> 04:02.720
He's still the suspect.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.026
And he is not gonna
leave town.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.506
Release him into my custody.

04:05.593 --> 04:06.811
[Lisbon]
'You know he's not good for it.'

04:06.898 --> 04:08.900

'Nada...niente.'

04:11.512 --> 04:14.645
Zip...naught.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.386
I could go on.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.258
[Lisbon]
'I am reaching out
to you, detective.'

04:18.345 --> 04:19.737
I know this man
and I know

04:19.824 --> 04:23.001
he's telling the truth
about what happened.

04:23.088 --> 04:26.222
- The truth. Now.
- Beg your pardon?

04:26.309 --> 04:27.441
Talk, or I will
give you back

04:27.528 --> 04:29.530
to Detective Reece.
Seriously.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.619
My wife's brother called
me and asked for my help.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.882
He gave me this address
and when I got here

04:33.969 --> 04:35.405
I found the dead guy.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.450
I guess he called
the police on me.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.626
Your wife has a brother?

04:38.713 --> 04:40.410
Yeah. Danny Ruskin.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.195
Okay. Why'd he
call the cops?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.241
- Force my involvement.
- Why?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.851
Well, either he didn't
kill Landon Wale

04:46.938 --> 04:48.331
and he wants me to help
him catch the real killer

04:48.418 --> 04:49.724
or he did kill
Landon Wale, and he wants me

04:49.811 --> 04:50.942
to help him elude justice.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.117
And you would
do that for him?

04:52.204 --> 04:53.554
That's a very good question.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.209
You know if
the county fair's in town?

04:59.603 --> 05:01.039
[Rigsby]
'Mrs. Wale, what was
your husband's connection'

05:01.126 --> 05:02.954
to K-Ram Investments?

05:03.041 --> 05:06.175
Where you found him?

05:06.262 --> 05:08.395
I've never heard
of it before today.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.006
Me, neither
and...my brother and I

05:11.093 --> 05:13.225
were business partners.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.357
Real estate.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.837
Landon was a good man.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.100
Why would someone
want to hurt him?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.189
We'll let you know.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.843
And we understand
that Heather Rade is here?

05:21.930 --> 05:23.366
Lan's assistant?

05:23.453 --> 05:25.629
Upstairs.

05:25.716 --> 05:29.111
Heather.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.547
Concetta,honey.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.070
People are bringing
lots of food.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.898
- You don't need to do this.
- No, I do.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.335
I need to keep busy.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.642
I can't believe
this is happening.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.514
Yes, Melanie?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.342
Oh. The police?

05:42.429 --> 05:44.561
Yes, ma'am, did Mr. Wale
ever speak to you about

05:44.648 --> 05:46.694
a brokerage in Sacramento
called K-ram Investments?

05:46.781 --> 05:48.173
Sacramento?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.654
Landon has a money guy here.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.134
Sorry, no.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.353
Mrs. Wale,
did your husband

05:53.440 --> 05:55.833
ever wear jewelry?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.095
No.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.797
We, uh...found this on him.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.887
[Rigsby]
'It's a ruby. Half-carat.'

06:05.974 --> 06:07.149
[keypad beeping]

06:14.374 --> 06:16.114
Oh, my god. It's gone.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.727
Why would Landon take it?

06:19.814 --> 06:22.904
Landon gave me
this statue of...Aphrodite

06:22.991 --> 06:25.036
on our honeymoon,
you know, Aphrodite, the--

06:25.123 --> 06:26.995
The Greek goddess of love
and sexuality. Yes, ma'am.

06:27.082 --> 06:30.085
[Mrs. Wale]
'It had rubies
along the base.'

06:30.172 --> 06:33.088
I have a photo of it
for insurance purposes here.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.306
How valuable is it?

06:34.394 --> 06:38.006
It was worth
over $200,000.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.399
Well, you should
file a claim.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.140
Looks like
the killer took it.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.359
[sighs]

06:45.796 --> 06:46.710
Jane.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.103
Yeah.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.018
- Okay. Thank you.
- Jane?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.498
County fair
starts Saturday.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.760
So Danny will be there?

06:52.847 --> 06:54.196
Well, no.
It's not that simple.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.893
But someone there
will know where he is.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.939
He's a carny
like you used to be?

06:58.026 --> 07:00.332
Uh, carny is a very
broad term, Lisbon.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.770
Uh, Danny's more showbiz.
But it's-it's been a while.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.554
Before last night
when was the last time

07:04.641 --> 07:07.731
you talked to him?

07:07.818 --> 07:08.776
When I called
him to tell him

07:08.863 --> 07:12.562
what Red John had done.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.824
[Van Pelt]
'Boss.'

07:13.911 --> 07:16.174
K-ram investments
doesn't exist.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.872
It's not registered
on any stock exchange.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.874
- It's not even a real company.
- Who owns it?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.702
A holding company
signed the lease.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.399
I tracked that through
three other outfits

07:23.486 --> 07:25.445
to get to a Daniel Ruskin.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.924
Daniel Ruskin.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.665
- He got a sheet?
- Long one.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.625
Got hooked for larceny,
passing bad checks.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.930
Nothing violent.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.018
Then was popped
for fraud

07:34.105 --> 07:35.455
two years ago
in Toronto.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.673
He's a con man,
basically.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.023
Oh. Show business, eh?

07:39.110 --> 07:42.679
Well, confidence game,
showbiz...it's a thin line.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.333
So maybe,
the victim was a mark

07:44.420 --> 07:45.987
in one of Danny's cons.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.815
Vic finds out.
They fight.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.904
Danny kills him
and steals the statuette.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.514
Possible,
Danny is usually

07:51.601 --> 07:52.994
smoother than that.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.778
Right,
very smooth.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.258
The way he forced
you onto this case.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.869
It's clever.
You're a pawn in his game.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.306
I'm not a pawn. He..

08:01.393 --> 08:03.004
Yeah? What?

08:03.091 --> 08:04.919
Oh, you're very good.
You almost got me talking.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.442
All right. What are
you keeping from me?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.313
Nothing.
He's family. That's all.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.314
[Van Pelt]
'Van Pelt.'

08:09.401 --> 08:10.751
Complicated, right?

08:10.838 --> 08:12.143
'Boss, it's
Detective Reece for you.'

08:12.230 --> 08:13.405
- They got a call.
- It's for you.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.233
To Jane's phone
from the K-Ram offices.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.670
He's on his way over.

08:16.757 --> 08:17.888
Stall him.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.674
Stall him?

08:20.761 --> 08:21.762
[sighs]

08:21.849 --> 08:24.721
[indistinct conversations]

08:34.514 --> 08:36.820
[instrumental music]

08:38.605 --> 08:41.912
I didn't know your wife
was from this world, too.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.174
Oh, yeah.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.482
Her grandparents
were...carny royalty.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.223
They ran big metal..

08:48.310 --> 08:50.486
...ferris wheels,
ghost trains.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.096
They ran 'em
all across the Midwest

08:52.183 --> 08:55.273
but, uh, my wife, she, uh..

08:55.360 --> 08:57.101
...she didn't want
to have any part of it.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.886
Why?

08:58.973 --> 09:02.063
Well, eh...carnies
are good people

09:02.150 --> 09:03.238
but, uh, you know,
you're either

09:03.325 --> 09:04.587
with the show
or you're not.

09:04.674 --> 09:05.936
There's-there's
nowhere in the middle.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.155
And if you're not
with the show

09:07.242 --> 09:08.591
then you're a mark.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.898
You're a sucker.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.727
And she didn't like that.
You're not gonna need the badge.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.251
They're gonna tell
you're a cop without it.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.080
Actually, people very
rarely guess I'm a cop.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.082
Oh, yeah.
Let me do the talking.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.866
When it's advisable.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.433
And don't mention
Danny until I do.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.043
I'll be
the judge of that.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.742
Hey! No trespassing.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.919
Fair's not open yet. Scram.

09:32.006 --> 09:36.358
Or else what?

09:36.445 --> 09:37.968
Or else I'll give
you a good whupping.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.057
- That's what else.
- Uh, how about this, Pete?

09:40.144 --> 09:42.364
If you can catch
me...then I will marry

09:42.451 --> 09:46.063
that damn ugly
sister of yours.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.894
Patrick Jane.
Son of a bitch.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.897
[laughing]

09:53.984 --> 09:56.378
Oh, man!

09:57.858 --> 09:59.860
I heard you were police.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.601
I didn't believe it.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
But here you are
with a real, live cop.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.605
This is my good friend Teresa.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.302
Doesn't bite.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.565
If you're okay with Jane..

10:09.652 --> 10:11.393
...I guess
you're okay with me.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.613
Thanks.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.136
You know, I haven't
seen you a while, eh?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.485
Well, you know.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.965
Yeah, I know.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.053
So what brings
you here now?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.097
I'll give you
three guesses.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.316
Uh, Danny?

10:21.403 --> 10:22.839
Got it in one.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.275
Danny's a good boy.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.016
What's he been up to?

10:26.103 --> 10:27.583
Hey, Sam.
Come on out here.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.759
I got a surprise
for you, honey.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.066
Come on. You ready?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.242
- 'Ta-da!'
- Oh, look at you, huh?

10:34.329 --> 10:35.504
Yeah.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.638
Ah!

10:38.725 --> 10:40.683
- Uh, what was that for?
- Detroit.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.032
Oh, yeah.
Fair enough.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.077
Mm-hmm.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.644
What's with
the state trooper?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.210
[Pete]
'Yeah, it's like,
unreal, huh?'

10:46.297 --> 10:48.604
A Jane
working with the law.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
- How do I look like a cop?
- Oh, please.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.521
Look like Cagney and Lacey
had a baby. Called it Pepper.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.175
[laughs]

10:54.262 --> 10:56.656
- They're looking for Danny.
- Danny's in trouble.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.700
[Pete]
'Yeah, what else is new?'

10:57.787 --> 10:59.136
'Danny's always in trouble.'

10:59.223 --> 11:01.225
Remember the morning
of your wedding?

11:01.312 --> 11:02.574
[laughs]

11:02.662 --> 11:03.619
Oh, yes. Yeah.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.534
My-my wife had to bail

11:05.621 --> 11:07.362
Danny out in her dress.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.146
She was not very happy.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.408
[Sam]
'Well, it's good
to see you and all'

11:10.495 --> 11:12.889
but the police is
the police. No offense.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.456
None taken.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.806
Well, Pete, wh-why don't
you take Pepper here

11:16.893 --> 11:19.940
and, uh, show
her the elephant?

11:20.027 --> 11:21.376
I'd love to see
the elephant.

11:21.463 --> 11:25.336
My pleasure.
Right this way.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.381
Her name is Daisy.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.425
[elephant snorts]

11:27.512 --> 11:29.340
She's cute.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.081
She's a mean old girl.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.866
She'd run down
her own kids for an apple.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.345
No.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.696
You think I'm kidding?
Here. Give her one.

11:36.783 --> 11:37.827
Where do I put it?

11:37.914 --> 11:41.135
In here.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.528
You two get along,
you can take her home with you.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.227
You want another one?

11:46.314 --> 11:47.576
[laughs]

11:47.663 --> 11:49.839
What kind of trouble
Danny got?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.972
Worst kind of trouble.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.365
Damn shame.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.237
'Not surprised though.'

11:56.324 --> 11:59.806
Danny's been heading downhill
all the way since Angela died.

11:59.893 --> 12:03.418
There's a man
needed a big sister.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.462
Yeah.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.855
So..

12:05.942 --> 12:08.075
...I should help you
and the cops..

12:08.162 --> 12:10.381
...find him.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.819
Why?

12:12.906 --> 12:15.560
Danny called me, uh,
just out of the blue

12:15.647 --> 12:17.519
and he asked for my help.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.608
Danny doesn't always do

12:19.695 --> 12:21.784
what's best
for his own interests.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.047
'Tendency to outfox himself.'

12:24.134 --> 12:26.223
True.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.398
[chuckles]

12:27.485 --> 12:28.443
But he asked for my help

12:28.530 --> 12:31.011
and that's what
I'll give him.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.273
[chuckles]

12:32.360 --> 12:33.535
[inhales deeply]

12:36.016 --> 12:37.408
A few hours ago,
I was wiping

12:37.495 --> 12:39.236
a murder weapon clean,
in case it had

12:39.323 --> 12:42.936
Danny's fingerprints on it.

12:47.549 --> 12:51.945
I don't know
where Danny is now.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.599
But Nicki does.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.427
Talk to Biltmore Nicki.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.690
[teapot whistling]

12:58.778 --> 13:02.433
Same gig as always.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.656
It's good to see you.

13:07.743 --> 13:11.051
I'm glad you're doing okay.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.487
You are doing okay,
aren't you?

13:12.574 --> 13:14.968
Oh, yeah.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.060
My little friend Pepper
is gonna need a ride

13:20.147 --> 13:21.496
back to the office.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.671
She's huge.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.500
[snuffles]

13:25.587 --> 13:28.938
Kinda tickles.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.201
[car engine turns over]

13:31.288 --> 13:32.463
Hey!

13:34.161 --> 13:35.292
Jane!

13:45.346 --> 13:46.477
Detective Reece called
three times. He's pissed.

13:46.564 --> 13:47.827
He can get in line.

13:47.914 --> 13:48.871
Where's Van Pelt?

13:48.958 --> 13:49.916
Oh, hey, boss.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.526
Can I borrow the car?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.962
Ha ha ha.
That's funny.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.311
Anything on Ruskin?

13:54.398 --> 13:56.661
Uh, yeah, he's a,
uh, former escape artist.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.621
Had an act as a kid,
just like Jane. "Houdini Jr."

13:59.708 --> 14:02.015
Says he could do the water
torture cell trick at 17.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.887
'Which I guess is good,
if you like that sort of thing.'

14:04.974 --> 14:06.323
Cho, go and talk
to the victim's wife.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.108
See if she knows Ruskin.

14:08.195 --> 14:11.111
Rigsby, have Van Pelt help
you look into his financials.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.027
Look for other names.
Con men rarely work alone.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.332
Where is Van Pelt?

14:15.419 --> 14:18.292
[instrumental music]

14:28.563 --> 14:31.174
Daniel Ruskin?

14:31.261 --> 14:34.221
I don't know him. Sorry.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.876
But you do?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.486
I have met Daniel.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.923
He's very charming.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.620
I'm sure
he wouldn't hurt Landon.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.927
You know Ruskin?

14:45.014 --> 14:47.843
But you told us you never
heard of his company, K-Ram.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.890
No. I-I have no notion
of his business.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.283
I met Daniel socially

14:53.370 --> 14:54.545
at Landon's country club.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.069
Murphy introduced us.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.505
- Murphy Traver?
- Mm.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.028
Oh, a lovely man.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.856
Of the Long Island Travers.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.255
Thank you for your
cooperation Mr. Traver.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.387
Oh, happy to talk,
agents, yeah, I just need

15:10.474 --> 15:12.215
to get back
to this meeting in a few.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.651
Can't trust
computer nerds

15:13.738 --> 15:15.827
alone too long,
you know.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.265
Oh, gosh.
Poor Landon. It's horrible.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.788
So you introduced
him to Ruskin?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.442
Yeah, yeah.
Sure did. I, uh, yeah.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.660
Met Daniel at the club.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
He's just
an outstanding guy.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.534
But, well, why do you want
to know about Daniel?

15:26.621 --> 15:27.709
Well, he's a con man.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.580
He may have
killed Mr. Wale.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.799
Do you know
where he is?

15:30.886 --> 15:32.714
Con man?
Oh, my god.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.933
My god.
I invested with him.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.457
Oh, my God.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.721
Where's your assistant?

15:39.808 --> 15:41.853
I'm-I'm sorry, agent.
I-I have to call my bank.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.377
Yeah, you know,
a place like this.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.031
Bunch of people,
you should have an assistant.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.075
At least a receptionist.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.685
And with all those employees

15:47.772 --> 15:50.427
the phone lines should
be ringing off the hook.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.038
Landlines.
So 20th-century.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.909
No, agent, I-I'm sorry,
you c-you're not allowed

15:53.996 --> 15:56.520
in there. That's
a clean room, agent!

15:56.607 --> 15:58.958
[indistinct conversations]

15:59.959 --> 16:02.352
Very clean.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.487
[grunts]

16:09.751 --> 16:12.841
I am having a very bad day.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.843
And you're gonna
tell us about Daniel Ruskin.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.497
- Come on.
- Just-okay. All right.

16:23.286 --> 16:26.333
[panting]
My dear, sorry to bother.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.813
Did you see two boys
run down the street?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.554
No.

16:30.641 --> 16:31.729
Ma'am, what's wrong?

16:31.816 --> 16:34.950
I was walking
to the train station.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.299
It's such a nice day.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.519
And these
two boys just..

16:38.606 --> 16:39.868
...took my purse.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.131
Ma'am, here.
Come here. Sit down.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.350
Oh.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.311
I have to visit my sister.

16:48.398 --> 16:51.793
She's in the hospital
in Bakersfield.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.273
I feel so stupid.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.839
Oh, that's terrible.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.929
And the...the last
train to Bakersfield

16:58.017 --> 16:59.844
leaves in 40 minutes.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.411
Oh, dear.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.935
Oh. Look, uh..

17:04.023 --> 17:05.415
[gasps]

17:05.502 --> 17:08.070
...can I drive you
to the train station?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.811
You would do that?

17:09.898 --> 17:11.291
Oh, my dear.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.379
Oh, thank you.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.859
Sure. Mm.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.689
[Patrick]
'You're not taking
her anywhere, Grace.'

17:20.517 --> 17:24.652
Nice hook, Nicki.

17:24.739 --> 17:28.090
You're such
a sweet old lady.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.223
Grace, Nicki.
Nicki, Grace.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.528
If this were for real

17:31.615 --> 17:36.055
this old fox would
have you stripped bare.

17:36.142 --> 17:40.015
This sweet piece
of fruit is a cop?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.669
[chuckles]
Damn.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.279
Guess I'm losing my touch.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.238
I'm looking for Danny.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.326
[chuckles]

17:46.413 --> 17:47.501
Look at me.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.720
Danny?

17:49.807 --> 17:51.287
Look at me.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.115
This is a family thing.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.986
I know you know where
he is. Tell me, Nicki.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.945
Or this nice piece of fruit
will take you Downtown

17:57.032 --> 18:00.644
and treat you to
a complimentary cavity search.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.172
Hypothetically,
what happened?

18:06.259 --> 18:09.349
Hypothetically?

18:09.436 --> 18:12.091
We were running..."the rag."

18:12.178 --> 18:13.701
We'll let you
invest in a surefire

18:13.788 --> 18:14.745
stock market winner.

18:14.832 --> 18:15.833
It's a little illegal.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.052
Shh, don't tell anybody.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
Blah, blah.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.795
Hypothetically..

18:20.882 --> 18:22.579
...Danny hooked
Landon good.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.625
I mean, had him begging
us to let him invest.

18:24.712 --> 18:25.843
He was bringing us some..

18:25.930 --> 18:28.063
...statue worth 200 grand.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.500
So you and Danny killed
Landon and took the statue.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.328
No, no, why take it
when he was gonna

18:32.415 --> 18:33.373
give it to us
in the morning?

18:33.460 --> 18:34.983
Maybe you took it, Murphy.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.550
You didn't wanna
share with Danny

18:36.637 --> 18:38.378
so you called Wale
and met him early.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.422
Things got out of hand.

18:39.509 --> 18:40.684
You need to help yourself.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.730
- Tell your side.
- No, no, no.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.601
- You're a liar.
- She's right. You are.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.213
Where's Danny Ruskin?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.346
You're a businessman.
So is Danny.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.392
He'll understand.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.784
I don't know.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.743
I don't.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.658
But I know who he's with.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.051
Trixie...somebody.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.445
Rich and hot.

19:02.532 --> 19:06.145
Yeah. Danny's always got
a second revenue stream.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.755
Always..

19:07.842 --> 19:10.627
...monetizing.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.108
[cell phone rings]

19:14.675 --> 19:15.632
Excuse me.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.504
Jane, where
the hell are you?

19:17.591 --> 19:18.940
[Patrick]
'Wow. Hope that's a
decaf you're getting.'

19:19.027 --> 19:20.159
How did you kn--

19:20.246 --> 19:22.465
I can hear
the foam machine.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.033
Anyway, I promised Grace
I'd call, so I called.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.600
Lovely to talk
to you. Bye now.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.558
- Put her on now.
- No, I've already ditched her.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.604
Jane, you have to come in.

19:30.691 --> 19:31.996
Danny could be dangerous.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.433
We're not looking
to use deadly force.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.477
But things happen.

19:34.564 --> 19:35.696
It's not safe for you.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.219
Getting close
to nabbing him, are you?

19:37.306 --> 19:38.525
Oh, that's good to hear.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.788
Well, may the best
man win, Lisbon.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.487
- Jane!
- Boss.

19:44.574 --> 19:45.836
Checked the sign-in logs
at the K-Ram Offices.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.534
Found a Trixie Mercado.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.752
She's the daughter of the
guy who owns the building.

19:48.839 --> 19:49.840
She has a place in midtown.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.929
Thanks.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.105
May the best man win.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.456
[cell phone beeps]

19:56.543 --> 19:58.240
Detective Reece,
it's Lisbon.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.763
We've got a lead on Ruskin.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.246
It's party time.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.118
Oh.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.685
Baby, why are you packing?

20:08.772 --> 20:10.774
God, y-you are killingme.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.123
You're so gorgeous.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.125
Seriously,
uh, I'm dying

20:14.213 --> 20:16.258
but I gotta go, baby.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.738
Something came up.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.697
I'll be back soon,
all right?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.351
- Danny.
- Hey.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.180
Long time.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.964
Danny, what the hell?

20:27.051 --> 20:29.445
You must be,
uh, Trixie, huh?

20:29.532 --> 20:31.795
Hi. I'm-I'm Patrick.
No need to be scared.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.536
'Danny and I, we're family.'

20:33.623 --> 20:35.059
Biltmore Nicki called
you, huh? And that's it?

20:35.146 --> 20:36.191
You're just
gonna hop on out of here?

20:36.278 --> 20:37.584
- I--
- I just got here.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.063
You're mad.
I get that. I do.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.283
But I needed your help.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.806
I needed your
wisdom and cunning--

20:42.893 --> 20:43.894
Yeah, how much
help can I be to you

20:43.981 --> 20:45.113
when I'm
in handcuffs, Danny?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.941
[chuckles]
Wh-what can I say?

20:47.028 --> 20:49.465
Calling you in was the best
of some very unsavory options.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.250
Then tell me what happened
with Landon Wale last night.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.295
Honest and quick.
I don't have all day.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.514
[knock on door]

20:54.601 --> 20:57.168
[Lisbon]
'Police, open up.'

20:59.475 --> 21:00.607
You son of a bitch.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.391
That has nothing
to do with me.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.958
[Lisbon]
'Trixie Mercado,
are you in there?'

21:04.045 --> 21:07.091
- 'We've got some questions.'
- Oh, please.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.833
What the hell
is going on?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.009
Look, just talk to 'em.
I have influence.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.968
We can sort
this thing out.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.318
If you didn't do anything
you got nothing to worry about.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.754
Nothing to worry about?

21:17.841 --> 21:20.975
I am not spending a day
in jail. Not one day.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.803
Never again.
Ever. You got me?

21:22.890 --> 21:24.195
[cocks gun]

21:24.283 --> 21:25.414
[knocking on door]

21:31.420 --> 21:33.944
Ms. Mercado,
open the door right now.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.076
Back up.
I'm going in.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.079
Give me some room.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.081
Back up!

21:44.303 --> 21:46.435
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.784
Danny's not here.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.917
[instrumental music]

21:54.182 --> 21:58.752
Yep. Danny went that way.
All by himself.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.189
All units search the area.
Suspect has fled.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.626
Establish a 2-block perimeter
around this loc.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.892
- You're Patrick's friend?
- Yeah.

22:08.979 --> 22:11.417
He said to tell you he's really
really sorry about all this.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.549
Jane's with Danny?

22:13.636 --> 22:15.899
Jane? No.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.032
It was a man. Patrick.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.125
[instrumental music]

22:24.212 --> 22:27.084
Tell me what happened
with Landon Wale.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.695
Ooh, big detective.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.523
Consultant.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.481
- Consultant.
- Stop stalling.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.179
Just tell me if you killed the
man and I'll take you to Mexico.

22:35.266 --> 22:39.183
I'm touched. Cabo?
You-you'd do that for me?

22:39.270 --> 22:42.491
- 'Yes, I would.'
- Why?

22:42.578 --> 22:44.580
Because your sister
would want me to.

22:44.667 --> 22:48.105
You sound like a mark.
Or you think I'm a mark. Which?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.716
You sound like
you're in over your head.

22:49.803 --> 22:54.285
Yeah, wayover my head.
Not like Patrick. No.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.592
'You would never get in way
over your head, would you?'

22:56.679 --> 22:59.378
Too smart for that, never made
mistakes. Not the boy wonder.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.031
Why won't you answer
my question?

23:03.033 --> 23:04.774
Is it because you hate me

23:04.861 --> 23:06.820
or is it because you did,
in fact, kill the man?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.867
Hate.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.956
Why would I hate you, bro?

23:13.043 --> 23:15.916
I asked my question first.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.310
I didn't kill Landon.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.225
I smell deception..

23:21.312 --> 23:22.575
...but it's hard
to tell with you

23:22.662 --> 23:24.228
'because you're
kind of a sociopath'

23:24.315 --> 23:26.405
'like all the great con men.'

23:26.492 --> 23:29.190
I am great, huh?

23:29.277 --> 23:32.628
First compliment you ever
gave me I can recall.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.891
Convince me, Danny.
Come on. Try.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.720
Just-just make me believe
that you didn't kill that guy.

23:37.807 --> 23:42.638
You want me to dance for you,
hmm? I should crawl for you?

23:42.725 --> 23:45.119
Okay, that's it. I'm leaving,
and I'm gonna call the cops.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.208
They will be here
in five minutes.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.166
I would make yourself scarce.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.647
[door opens]
Stop!

23:51.734 --> 23:52.779
Stop!

23:52.866 --> 23:54.737
[gun cocks]

23:54.824 --> 23:56.913
You think I won't do it?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.567
Not sure.

23:58.654 --> 24:01.222
[dramatic music]

24:01.309 --> 24:03.006
I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.674
Agent Hightower.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.244
You lied to me.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.506
Detective Reece
has some concerns

24:24.593 --> 24:27.030
about the Landon Wale case.

24:27.117 --> 24:30.294
Seems like you didn't tell him
that Jane is the brother-in-law

24:30.381 --> 24:33.210
of Daniel Ruskin,
the prime suspect.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.212
At the time of my conversation
with Detective Reece

24:35.299 --> 24:36.866
I didn't know
about the connection.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.826
I apologize for the oversight.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.175
I'm supposed to buy that?

24:41.262 --> 24:43.569
No purchase required,
detective.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.006
- Where's Jane now?
- Oh, I don't know where he is.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.834
You don't know where he is?

24:47.921 --> 24:51.620
Okay. I tell you what,
this is what I'm going to do.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.317
I'm gonna get an arrest warrant

24:53.404 --> 24:55.711
and I'm gonna have
every cop on the street

24:55.798 --> 24:57.496
looking for him and Ruskin.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.236
You need to get control
of your unit, lady.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.456
What you have right here
is slackness.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.111
[dramatic music]

25:04.198 --> 25:07.680
If Mr. Jane is involved
in obstruction of justice

25:07.767 --> 25:10.900
aiding and abetting,
or anything like that..

25:12.162 --> 25:13.120
...he's yours.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.427
Are we done?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.907
I guess we are.

25:17.994 --> 25:18.908
Keep in touch.

25:29.876 --> 25:30.790
Jane's in trouble.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.449
Detective Rigsby.
You wanted to talk to me?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.626
It's agent.
Uh, we're re-interviewing

25:40.713 --> 25:42.236
a number of Mr. Wale's
associates.

25:42.323 --> 25:45.413
It's just routine.
Let's go to my desk, shall we?

25:45.500 --> 25:47.763
You look...different.

25:47.850 --> 25:51.506
Yeah, it's really hot
at the office. The air's broken.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.248
No money to fix it?

25:54.335 --> 25:55.466
We found out that the company

25:55.554 --> 25:57.164
was gonna file
for bankruptcy, Heather.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.295
The place is broke.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.862
You should really
talk to Melanie.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.517
Yeah, but what happened
to the company?

26:02.604 --> 26:04.606
Do you read the news?

26:04.693 --> 26:06.565
Real estate's not doing so well

26:06.652 --> 26:09.176
and Landon made
a bad deal or seven.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.961
He was a cowboy,
a win big, lose big.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.441
Please take a seat.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.578
[clears throat]
So how did, uh

26:19.665 --> 26:21.754
Melanie and Concetta take
the bankruptcy news?

26:21.841 --> 26:24.365
They didn't know.
Landon only told me.

26:24.452 --> 26:27.194
I, uh, I keep the books.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.373
So you're looking at them, huh?

26:32.460 --> 26:36.029
Hmm? We look at every place,
at everybody.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.421
Hmm.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.075
"Hmm" meaning what?

26:39.162 --> 26:41.730
No, nothing. It's just..

26:41.817 --> 26:44.341
Who knew he'd be worth
more dead than alive?

26:44.428 --> 26:45.604
You mean life insurance?

26:45.691 --> 26:46.605
Uh-huh.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.957
[dramatic music]

26:55.526 --> 26:56.484
Thank you.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.232
Well, this policy's
less than three months old.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.363
Did Mrs. Wale take it out?

27:06.450 --> 27:08.322
Connie? No.

27:08.409 --> 27:11.978
She's not the beneficiary.
Melanie is.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.197
The sister.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.546
Well, what's it worth?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.287
$2 million.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.640
If you know where they are,
you need to tell me.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.164
Sac PD's got a manhunt going.

27:24.251 --> 27:27.515
Jane and Danny
could get arrested or shot.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.865
They're survivors.
They're gonna do okay.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.085
Jane will get fired
from the CBI.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.260
Oh, no.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.567
This job is all he has.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.700
If he's arrested,
they'll take that from him.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.484
I'm his friend.
I can help.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.054
Ms. Lisbon

27:45.141 --> 27:47.753
they just took off.
We don't know where they went.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.233
- You swear?
- I swear.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.023
[instrumental music]

28:00.243 --> 28:02.202
[engine revving]

28:05.422 --> 28:06.380
My sister..

28:08.077 --> 28:10.863
...was the only good,
clean honest thing

28:10.950 --> 28:12.952
that I had in my life..

28:13.039 --> 28:14.214
And you ran off with her.

28:16.172 --> 28:19.349
You took her away from me,
away from what she knew, so..

28:19.436 --> 28:21.917
you know, yeah,
I've been mad at you.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.963
Very mad.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.182
I didn't, I didn't
take her away.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.710
She didn't, she didn't want
the carny life. She hated it.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.800
She wanted to get out.
We-we both did.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.063
'And you know how hard that is.'

28:37.150 --> 28:39.456
That was, that was our thing.
That's what we did together.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.068
We-we-we escaped together.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.113
Nice escape plan, bro.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.463
- 'You got her killed.'
- Thanks for reminding me.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.596
Yeah, you just had
to be a big shot

28:48.683 --> 28:51.207
had to get on the TV
and run your mouth.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.516
It's your fault she's dead.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.735
Yes.

28:56.822 --> 28:57.736
It is.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.087
I know that. It ismy fault.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.222
And I just, I hope that one day,
you will, uh, forgive me.

29:06.309 --> 29:07.615
[dramatic music]

29:07.702 --> 29:10.052
And maybe one day
I'll forgive myself.

29:10.139 --> 29:13.795
- Forgive you?
- Not for my sake. For yours.

29:13.882 --> 29:16.102
Because hating me is just
a waste of your energy.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.277
It's pointless.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.455
Just move on. Drop it.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.891
Find something to love.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.719
[scoffs]
Love?

29:26.808 --> 29:28.244
Man, you really have changed.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.289
Yeah.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.032
I don't, I don't know if I..

29:34.860 --> 29:36.905
I don't require
an answer, Danny.

29:36.992 --> 29:37.906
I just..

29:39.952 --> 29:43.129
[dramatic music]

29:43.216 --> 29:45.131
You got something in your eye?

29:45.218 --> 29:47.873
I got allergies. It's..

29:47.960 --> 29:49.309
- 'Oh?'
- It's pollen.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.529
Hey.

29:54.009 --> 29:54.923
I'm sorry.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.711
Landon Wale.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.588
Yeah, Landon.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.632
Boy..

30:10.025 --> 30:11.157
There's a mark.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.510
He was so hot to get taken.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.599
He called me that night

30:18.686 --> 30:21.341
and wanted to move up
the action.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.299
When I got there,
he was dead.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.562
That's it.

30:25.649 --> 30:26.868
I did not kill him.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.305
What was the action?

30:29.392 --> 30:32.091
Landon was supposed to bring
me the gold statue.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.354
Not to give to me,
just to show me, you know

30:34.441 --> 30:37.357
to prove he had the collateral
to invest in my hedge fund coup.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.794
And this mook was hooked deep.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.187
Thought he was flying to Brazil

30:41.274 --> 30:43.406
with his hot assistant
and all the money.

30:43.493 --> 30:46.105
Brazil, I like it. Old school.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.759
Yeah. He had it all mapped out

30:48.847 --> 30:51.327
little place on the beach,
a fishing boat.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.372
Perfect mark.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.549
Hey.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.899
To suckers. Gotta love 'em.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.252
[dramatic music]

31:10.912 --> 31:12.044
[tires screeching]

31:15.482 --> 31:16.439
Don't move.

31:20.922 --> 31:21.880
Keys.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.626
Go on.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.030
Jane!

31:44.772 --> 31:45.729
Jane!

31:49.995 --> 31:50.952
[knock on door]

31:51.039 --> 31:53.085
Jane, it's me.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.738
Hey, Lisbon.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.523
Excellent work finding us.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.700
I am very unhappy with you.
Is he in there?

31:59.787 --> 32:01.267
- Yeah.
- Bring him out.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.139
No funny business,
or I will shoot to kill.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.054
You're very persuasive.
We'll be right out.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.884
[instrumental music]

32:20.764 --> 32:22.157
Ms. Anders,
thanks for coming in.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.767
Sure. Uh, what's this about?

32:23.854 --> 32:25.726
Uh, the insurance policy.
We, uh, have a few questions.

32:25.813 --> 32:29.991
Policy? Oh, for Landon. Sure.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.384
You know, it's common

32:31.471 --> 32:32.776
to have a key man policy
for small businesses.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.126
I'm sure you can
straighten things out.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.823
We have some, uh, paperwork
to take care of.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.393
[Wayne]
'Check here
and sign here please.'

32:45.920 --> 32:47.226
Thanks for the call,
Agent Lisbon.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.358
My pleasure. We have a deal?

32:49.445 --> 32:50.925
Yeah, we'll forget about
your lies and incompetence.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.492
- Alright, up against the car.
- Hey. What?

32:52.579 --> 32:53.623
- Get your hands behind your..
- Hey, wait!

32:53.710 --> 32:54.668
- Hands behind the back.
- Wait.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.061
You said we could work it out

32:56.148 --> 32:57.627
if I came in, not him.
I got no deal with him.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.151
It's for the best, Danny.
It's for the best.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.587
We've all gotta get out
from underneath it sometime.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.458
- You bastard!
- Sorry.

33:02.545 --> 33:06.767
Aah! God. You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

33:06.854 --> 33:09.204
- Take it easy.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

33:09.291 --> 33:10.423
'You betrayed me!'

33:12.860 --> 33:13.904
I will kill you!

33:25.046 --> 33:26.265
Did you have to be
so rough with him?

33:26.352 --> 33:28.441
Don't tell me how to do my job.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.225
- Alright, both of you--
- Are you threatening me?

33:30.312 --> 33:31.835
- I'm not threatening anybody.
- If it weren't for me..

33:31.922 --> 33:32.880
- You wouldn't even have him
- Are you delusional?

33:32.967 --> 33:34.186
You blocked the investigation.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.883
- Every step of the way.
- You spat on me.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.406
- Hey, that's enough.
- You want to go in with him?

33:37.493 --> 33:38.799
Say the word. I'd be happy..

33:38.886 --> 33:41.019
[indistinct chattering]

33:41.802 --> 33:44.152
Oh, oh, oh!

33:44.239 --> 33:45.371
[male #2]
'Hey, hey, hey, stop!'

33:45.458 --> 33:47.025
Lisbon! Lisbon!

33:48.113 --> 33:49.940
[male #2]
'Hey!'

33:50.028 --> 33:51.159
[male #3]
'Stop! Hey!'

33:55.946 --> 33:58.253
[instrumental music]

34:16.663 --> 34:18.926
Hi. This is police business.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.320
Patrick Jane. I'm with the CBI.

34:21.407 --> 34:24.888
Yes, I saw you there,
when the killer escaped.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.717
- It was horrible, Connie.
- Terrible story.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.024
Yeah, well, I'd like to speak
to Ms. Wale alone, please.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.112
It's very important.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.202
Thank you.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.776
[sighs]

34:45.605 --> 34:46.693
[clears throat]

34:53.743 --> 34:55.702
This is awkward,
but we have reason to believe

34:55.789 --> 34:58.879
that Danny Ruskin has
every intention of killing you.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.010
- Me?
- Yes, you.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.186
He has a violent temper

35:01.273 --> 35:02.665
and several convictions
to prove it

35:02.752 --> 35:05.973
including shooting and killing
a man ten years ago.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.496
But why would
he want to hurt me?

35:09.542 --> 35:11.979
He figured it out.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.764
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
That you killed your own husband

35:14.851 --> 35:17.767
and in doing so,
ruined Danny Ruskin's life.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.291
What?

35:19.378 --> 35:21.858
Mr. Jane,
that's an outrageous charge.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.034
Yes, one I almost
didn't believe myself

35:24.122 --> 35:26.689
until meeting you just now.
Then it became glaringly obvious

35:26.776 --> 35:29.649
you have deep-seated control
issues mixed in with jealousy

35:29.736 --> 35:32.130
and your own weird lust
for violence.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.914
Landon was gonna
take the money

35:34.001 --> 35:35.872
and run away with that leggy
assistant. What's her name?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.961
Shut up. Landon loved me.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.659
No, he didn't,
and you know he didn't.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.313
Hell, maybe you even knew
that he was headed off

35:41.400 --> 35:43.967
to brazil with her, but what
you didn't know, Mrs. Wale

35:44.054 --> 35:45.708
is that Landon was being played.

35:45.795 --> 35:49.364
He was being conned by
no one other than Danny Ruskin.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.888
And when Landon took
your Aphrodite statue

35:51.975 --> 35:54.848
you assumed he was
gonna give it to the mistress.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.154
Your honeymoon gift..

35:57.764 --> 36:01.028
The very symbol
of your love for each other.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.465
So you followed Landon to where you thought he was gonna meet

36:03.552 --> 36:05.728
with that statuesque strumpet

36:05.815 --> 36:06.947
and you killed him.

36:07.034 --> 36:07.991
[gunfire]

36:10.080 --> 36:12.082
[dramatic music]

36:17.784 --> 36:20.787
Then you took what you thought was rightfully yours.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.878
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh.

36:24.965 --> 36:27.141
That Ruskin character
killed Landon.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.802
Where is the statue now,
Concetta?

36:35.889 --> 36:36.846
Huh?

36:38.587 --> 36:40.589
Uh, hey, wait!

36:40.676 --> 36:43.418
Wait! You can't go in there!

36:43.505 --> 36:45.986
Oh, look at this. You could
land a jumbo jet in here.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.075
Landon wasn't big on the,
uh, subtlety, was he?

36:48.162 --> 36:50.947
Probably why you knew
he was having an affair.

36:51.034 --> 36:52.645
You must leave, Mr. Jane..

36:54.734 --> 36:55.952
Right now.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.389
- You bitch.
- Aah!

37:00.087 --> 37:02.350
- And you..
- Easy.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.525
Christmas came early this year.

37:03.612 --> 37:04.874
Oh, Danny, another gun?

37:04.961 --> 37:06.876
Come on. Really? What, just..

37:06.963 --> 37:08.443
None of this would have
happened except for you.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.488
You ruined everything.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.141
Okay, listen. Danny..

37:11.229 --> 37:13.187
- You don't have to do this.
- Shut up!

37:13.274 --> 37:16.930
Okay, listen to me.
You're not this person.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.018
Okay? You're not
this person. Look--

37:18.105 --> 37:19.889
You backstabbed me!

37:19.976 --> 37:21.804
I trusted you.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.546
You think I'm a mark? You think
you can run games on me?

37:24.633 --> 37:26.679
Aah! Aah!

37:26.766 --> 37:28.507
Oh. Oh, my god.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.596
[groaning]

37:30.683 --> 37:31.597
You shot me.

37:33.729 --> 37:36.776
Son of a bitch.

37:36.863 --> 37:37.820
What'd you do that for?

37:37.907 --> 37:39.431
- 'Oh, my god.'
- Patrick.

37:40.519 --> 37:41.433
Bastard.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.000
No.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.046
[crying]
No.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.090
No, no, no, no.

37:48.614 --> 37:49.528
[grunts]

37:51.834 --> 37:52.835
'Stay with me.'

37:52.922 --> 37:54.968
[dramatic music]

38:02.367 --> 38:03.890
You made me shoot him.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.674
No, no. No, please.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.285
- This is your fault.
- No.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.591
This is your fault! God!

38:10.897 --> 38:12.855
'You ruined my life!'

38:12.942 --> 38:14.466
You deserve this, bitch.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.250
Your ruined my life.
I could have had everything!

38:16.337 --> 38:18.470
Okay, I can fix it!

38:18.557 --> 38:20.385
I'll fix it. I swear.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.258
Money. So much money

38:24.345 --> 38:26.652
you can go to Switzerland.
You can go anywhere you want.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.089
- Yeah?
- You don't have to kill me.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.221
Look, I can prove it.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.529
- Go!
- Oh! Okay.

38:34.616 --> 38:35.530
Okay.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.059
This is worth a lot of money.

38:43.146 --> 38:45.148
Take it. It's yours. Take it!

38:46.149 --> 38:47.107
Ha!

38:48.891 --> 38:49.849
[gasps]

38:52.591 --> 38:53.940
Connie, Connie, Connie.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.159
You fell for the oldest
gag in the book.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.031
Huh? And one of the cheapest

38:58.118 --> 39:00.294
3.55 at a novelty
store near you.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.688
Beats the hell
out of the cackle bladder.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.385
- You got a little..
- Mmm.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.735
A-a little..

39:06.822 --> 39:09.869
Kind of minty.
How are my teeth?

39:09.956 --> 39:12.741
'They're good?
That was great, huh?'

39:12.828 --> 39:14.830
[Kimball]
'Concetta Wale,
you're under arrest.'

39:14.917 --> 39:16.266
Turn around. Put your hands
behind your back.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.269
- Turn around.
- I'll take that.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.539
Come on. Let's go.

39:29.758 --> 39:32.718
Sac PD want to talk to you
about Landon Wale and K-Ram.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.024
There are some fraud
charges pending.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.243
[chuckles]

39:36.330 --> 39:38.506
Fraud is very hard to prove

39:38.593 --> 39:40.290
especially when nothing
changed hands.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.989
In fact, now that I think of it

39:43.076 --> 39:44.599
I'm actually innocent here.

39:44.686 --> 39:45.992
Whatever. They're on their way.

39:48.211 --> 39:51.650
I believe she's telling
you to scram.

39:51.737 --> 39:52.781
That's not what I said.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.441
[instrumental music]

40:05.577 --> 40:07.622
- Thank you, Lisbon.
- I didn't hear that.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.410
Thank you, Lisbon.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.628
I can't hear anything.

40:16.631 --> 40:19.417
[birds chirping]

40:33.866 --> 40:35.258
So..

40:35.345 --> 40:36.303
...this is it, huh?

40:38.044 --> 40:39.698
It's nice.

40:39.785 --> 40:40.699
Classy.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.877
They'd like it, I guess..

40:44.964 --> 40:47.967
'...if they had a preference.'

40:48.054 --> 40:50.665
You know, this is
the first time I've been here

40:50.752 --> 40:51.840
since the funeral.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.105
Why is that?

40:58.673 --> 40:59.631
Because they're not here.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.460
[sighs]

41:05.158 --> 41:06.464
Hey, who knows for sure?

41:06.551 --> 41:08.596
Maybe they're up
there right now

41:08.683 --> 41:11.469
looking down at us.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.646
You know, Annie's saying,
"Lighten up, you dummies."

41:16.386 --> 41:17.431
Yeah, maybe.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.000
Eesh.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.176
I'm sorry I asked to come.

41:23.263 --> 41:27.397
Who knew a trip to the cemetery
would be such a downer?

41:27.485 --> 41:28.703
Sorry. It's irrational.

41:28.790 --> 41:30.052
No reason to be sad.

41:35.884 --> 41:37.930
You gonna give 'em
those flowers or what?

41:40.759 --> 41:42.935
[dramatic music]

41:50.638 --> 41:51.857
Guilt is for marks.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.732
You know that, right?

41:57.819 --> 41:58.733
Yeah.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.484
[inhales deeply]

42:13.008 --> 42:15.707
[dramatic music]

42:40.209 --> 42:42.429
[Patrick]
Stay tuned for scenes
