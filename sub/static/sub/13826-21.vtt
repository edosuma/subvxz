14:54.853 --> 14:56.688
So just promise me we'll be careful.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.732
-Deal?
-Deal.

LORD HATER: Peepers, what... what is
that thing?

15:56.748 --> 15:59.751
It appears to be some kind of present.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.213
How...? Who would...?
What is wrong with him?

-(WATCHDOG LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
-The gift has made him happy.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.389
LORD HATER: But the watchdogs have
never been happy before.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.058
PEEPERS: Well, they've never received a
gift before.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.020
LORD HATER: Peepers, what're we gonna do?
If this spreads,

16:18.103 --> 16:19.897
the entire army will be ruined.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.690
PEEPERS: It's okay, sir.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.526
There's no way this happiness is
spreading.

he destroys us.

LORD HATER: Peepers, assemble a team.

16:44.213 --> 16:48.008
They're onto us. We don't have much time.
Find and secure Hater.

Man, Pete, if we make it out of
here alive, first thing I'm going to do

17:09.571 --> 17:13.534
is find that gal I met on shore leave,
buy a ring and ask her to be mine.

let's anyone have nice things. Like dreams

Sylvia, Hater's running away. We've gotta
get him his gift because if

18:31.778 --> 18:35.115
he doesn't get his gift, he won't
be filled with the giving spirit.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.868
So come on and hurry up if you will
please. Thank you!

Wander from

infecting me with the happies... and...

19:44.977 --> 19:46.812
this cocoa is really tasty.

I can't believe I'm saying this,
but you did something right for once.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.245
Man, who knew those pathetic Watchdogs
could be so awesome?

20:03.537 --> 20:06.206
Maybe all they needed was a
little niceness.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.378
WANDER: Maybe if someone wrote from
"Lord Hater" on all those gift tags...

20:11.461 --> 20:12.504
You mean...

20:12.588 --> 20:15.257
WANDER: A little nice makes naughty
think twice.

20:15.424 --> 20:18.927
So they paid it forward and did something
right for once,

20:19.553 --> 20:26.018
just like Hater wanted, which he should be
realizing right about...
