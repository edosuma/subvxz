the most camera‐ready
detectives in all of TV.

And our guest panelist
this week,

02:14.736 --> 02:18.778
she's an Emmy‐nominated favorite
here at the Masked universe.

Cheryl, so good
to have you here with us.

I am so happy to be here.

just to catch you
up to speed a little bit,

02:51.744 --> 02:56.185
this season we have
a Take It Off Buzzer.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.622
The way this works
for each group,

02:57.622 --> 03:02.498
one panelist can use it
only if they're 100% sure

03:02.498 --> 03:04.836
they know the identity
of the singer.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.274
Now if they're right,

03:07.307 --> 03:11.617
the singer must unmask
immediately and head home.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.386
‐ Wow.
‐ And the correct panelist

03:13.420 --> 03:18.063
is rewarded two extra points
towards the Golden Ear Trophy.

03:18.063 --> 03:20.902
All right, you guys ready
to get this show on the road?

03:22.304 --> 03:23.507
All right, we're digging deep

03:23.507 --> 03:27.181
and kicking things off
with Banana Split.

‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah, Banana Split!

03:32.024 --> 03:34.462

we really put on a show.</i>

03:34.495 --> 03:37.167

03:43.279 --> 03:45.718
It inspired us to take it
even further this week.

03:45.752 --> 03:47.989
<i>This is the semi‐finals.
This is the big‐time.</i>

03:48.022 --> 03:50.728
<i>I think our biggest competition
in this group so far</i>

03:50.762 --> 03:52.431
<i>‐ is Caterpillar.</i>
‐<i>Caterpillar.</i>

03:52.464 --> 03:54.536
<i>I mean,
personality alone, he wins.</i>

03:54.536 --> 03:57.642
<i>But I think our strength
is that we're theatrical.</i>

03:57.642 --> 04:00.515
‐ We put on a show.
‐ We're making 90 second movies.

04:00.515 --> 04:04.121

04:04.155 --> 04:05.658

<i>We wanna try and throw
them off with this song.</i>

04:08.163 --> 04:10.000
<i>We're channeling
our inner pop stars.</i>

04:10.033 --> 04:12.705
<i>It's funny,
because one of us dreamed
of being a pop star,</i>

04:12.739 --> 04:15.277
‐ but it didn't really pan out.
‐ Excuse me?

04:15.277 --> 04:17.014
‐ I didn't say it was you.
‐ Oh!

04:17.047 --> 04:20.955
‐ More Banana Shade
than Banana Split.
‐ They're not pop stars.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.159
<i>There's definitely an advantage
that there's the two of us</i>

04:23.193 --> 04:24.963
<i>because it just creates
more energy.</i>

04:24.996 --> 04:28.804

06:24.736 --> 06:25.671
Awesome job.

06:25.705 --> 06:29.311
Can I just say,
what a way to open the show?

06:29.345 --> 06:30.548
Yeah!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.520
It was absolutely incredible,

06:33.554 --> 06:35.791
and now it's driving me
even more crazy

06:35.825 --> 06:37.795
'cause I wanna know
who you are under that mask.

06:37.829 --> 06:41.369
‐Yes.
‐Indeed.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.406
This season our singers

06:43.439 --> 06:46.713
have a combined
84 Grammy nominations,

06:46.747 --> 06:49.318
27 wins,

06:49.351 --> 06:51.757
and multiple Oscar nominations.

06:51.790 --> 06:55.297
So tonight it's
Bring Your Trophy to Work Day.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.504
Which trophy is Banana Split
most proud of?

06:58.537 --> 07:01.375
Men in black,
bring out the hardware.

07:01.409 --> 07:02.612
Oh.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.058
‐ Oh.
‐Whoa.

07:10.628 --> 07:12.431
Oh!

07:12.464 --> 07:14.903
‐ Uh... oh.
‐Whoa!

07:14.903 --> 07:15.638
Oh.

07:15.838 --> 07:17.642
You guys see what this says
right here?

07:17.675 --> 07:18.544
‐ No.
‐ What does it say?

07:18.811 --> 07:23.486
It's a light up mirror,
and it says, "Favorite Hottie."

07:23.520 --> 07:27.394
So, collectively,
we have won quite a few awards,

07:27.427 --> 07:29.331
but that one
that you pointed out, Nick,

07:29.365 --> 07:30.835
I'm particularly proud of.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.972
‐ Okay. Go, Banana.
‐ Oh, my gosh.

07:33.006 --> 07:35.544
Well, it's pretty obvious
who the hottie is actually.

07:35.578 --> 07:38.049
‐Yeah.
‐ It ain't me. Whoa!

07:38.082 --> 07:40.186
Nice.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.627
Oh!
What is happening?

07:43.661 --> 07:45.765
I know, I know.
It's a family show.

07:45.798 --> 07:50.040
Please ask Ice Cream
how she won that award.

07:52.010 --> 07:54.315
You're just trying
to create problems.

07:54.348 --> 07:58.590
‐ Oh!
‐ She has lasers right now
underneath that mask.

07:58.624 --> 08:02.164
I don't remember,
and that could
be the real problem.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.201
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

08:04.234 --> 08:06.038
That I can relate to.

08:07.474 --> 08:09.679
You know, their chemistry alone
is amazing,

08:09.713 --> 08:10.881
I think we can all agree,

08:10.915 --> 08:12.885
but that can also be
very good best friends.

08:12.919 --> 08:14.789
‐ Right.
‐ And the new clue
that we saw today

08:14.789 --> 08:18.463
of him playing the drums
made me think of Ed Sheeran.

08:18.496 --> 08:20.266
Because Ed Sheeran
can play the piano amazing,

08:20.300 --> 08:24.008
he knows how to play the drums,
and guess who his BFF is.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.078
‐ Who?
‐ Jessie J.

08:26.112 --> 08:27.982
‐Oh!
‐ Oh.

08:28.016 --> 08:30.353
I'm going on this long‐time
collaborators also.

08:30.387 --> 08:32.792
Because now I see the drums,
and a lot of people don't know

08:32.792 --> 08:35.096
there's a singer
from One Republic

08:35.130 --> 08:35.931
whose name is Ryan Tedder.

08:36.198 --> 08:37.034
He actually writes a lot
of songs for other people.

08:37.502 --> 08:40.006
‐ He plays piano, he plays
the drum, he plays guitar.
‐ Epic.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.377
He wrote "Bleeding Love"
for Leona Lewis.

08:42.411 --> 08:46.820
I think this could be
One Republic's Ryan Tedder
and the lovely Leona Lewis.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.022
That's really good, Robin.
That's really good.

08:48.056 --> 08:51.963
The audience likes that.
Nicole, what you got?

08:51.963 --> 08:55.403
‐ Okay, so last time
we got a director clue, right?
‐ Yeah.

08:55.437 --> 09:01.048
So I'm going, okay,
could this be a director
like John "Kron‐gowski"?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.052
‐ John Krasinski, yeah.
‐ And John Macaroni.

09:03.086 --> 09:04.823
John Krasinski,
John Macaroni.

09:04.823 --> 09:08.831
‐ It's Krasinski, but...
‐ Okay? Married to Emily Blunt,

09:08.864 --> 09:11.135
who was in "Into the Woods."

09:11.168 --> 09:12.572
And you know what?

09:12.572 --> 09:14.609
‐ John Krin‐‐
‐ Krasinski.

09:14.642 --> 09:18.517
John Krasinski loves
to play the drums, guys.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.986
‐ Oh, he does.
‐ I'll tell you what,

09:20.019 --> 09:23.994
there are no quiet places
in his basement, okay?

09:24.929 --> 09:27.735
Well, tonight
is a double elimination,

09:27.769 --> 09:31.075
but I have a feeling
that you two are gonna make it.

09:31.108 --> 09:33.413
Outstanding job tonight.

09:33.446 --> 09:37.053
We all agree that was an amazing
performance from Banana Split.

09:37.087 --> 09:40.861
‐ Make some noise.
‐ I'm so confused.

09:40.861 --> 09:43.801
‐ Yeah, yeah.

a little dignity out there,
too, thanks to you.

into the finals, right?

09:53.987 --> 09:56.325

‐ Who is this?

09:56.358 --> 09:58.831

10:35.638 --> 10:37.240
It's "The Masked Singer!"

10:38.644 --> 10:41.048
And up next,
it's Caterpillar.

10:41.081 --> 10:43.754
And what's behind
his performance tonight?

10:43.787 --> 10:46.726
I'll let him
tell you all about it.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.736
After the last two performances,

10:51.736 --> 10:55.009
<i>you might think
I seem pretty comfortable
on this big stage.</i>

10:55.043 --> 10:57.347
But I'm not.
I'm kinda terrified.

10:57.380 --> 11:00.486
<i>You know, I've never done
anything like this before,</i>

11:00.486 --> 11:03.727
<i>but I'm doing exactly
what I've done my whole life.</i>

11:03.760 --> 11:05.731
I fake it until I make it.

11:05.764 --> 11:09.071
‐ Fake it until you make it.
‐ So not a boy bander.

11:09.071 --> 11:11.710
<i>I've done a pop song
and I've done a ballad.</i>

11:11.743 --> 11:13.446
I wanna show people
that I can do more.

11:13.479 --> 11:15.818
‐ We got it! We got it!
‐ <i>My mission for
this next performance</i>

11:15.818 --> 11:17.955
<i>is just to show some range.</i>

11:17.955 --> 11:20.961
<i>This song takes me back
to where I grew up.</i>

11:20.961 --> 11:22.965
<i>I'm gonna sing
an old country song</i>

11:22.965 --> 11:24.836
<i>that my sister and I
used to sing all the time.</i>

11:24.869 --> 11:26.973
‐Brother and sister.
‐ Maybe he has a famous family.

11:27.007 --> 11:31.850
‐ Famous family. Right!
‐ <i>It's crazy that it's gonna go
from four to two tonight.</i>

11:31.883 --> 11:34.522
<i>I wanna get
to the Group B finals
so freaking bad</i>

11:34.556 --> 11:37.394
<i>because, you know, when you
fake it until you make it,</i>

11:37.427 --> 11:38.931
and then you finally make it?

11:38.964 --> 11:41.335
<i>It feels pretty damn good.</i>

Who is that?

13:24.809 --> 13:27.414
Oh, my gosh!
We love Caterpillar!

13:27.447 --> 13:30.320
Crawling his way to the top.

13:32.123 --> 13:34.161
Jenny, your mouth is open.
You're like...

13:36.432 --> 13:37.400
I'm stumped.

13:37.668 --> 13:40.941
It's crazy because I totally
thought you were a boy bander.

13:40.974 --> 13:46.920
I was expecting sort
of a nerdy sounding person.

13:46.953 --> 13:49.358
But then to hear him sing
"Friends in Low Places"

13:49.391 --> 13:51.930
‐ and kill it...
‐ That was a big flip.

13:51.963 --> 13:56.005
‐ That was huge flip!
‐ All right, now what trophy

13:56.038 --> 13:58.209
does Caterpillar have
on his mantel at home?

13:58.242 --> 14:02.017
Men in black,
please bring out the hardware.

14:05.456 --> 14:08.029
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh.

14:16.946 --> 14:21.155
‐ State Champion Bible Quiz,
1st Place.
‐ Wow.

14:21.188 --> 14:22.825
Yeah, he's from the South.

14:22.858 --> 14:24.629
Southern boy.

14:24.662 --> 14:28.570
Nick, this award was a crowning
achievement in my life,

14:28.603 --> 14:32.845
but nothing comes close to when
I received that VMA Award.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.448
‐ What?
‐ What?

14:34.481 --> 14:35.584
‐ VMA Award?
‐ VMA?

14:35.617 --> 14:37.287
Okay, wait a second.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.828
Do you wanna know
who was nominated for a VMA

14:40.861 --> 14:42.998
‐ that's a country singer?
‐ Who?

14:43.032 --> 14:45.236
Florida Georgia Line, people.

14:45.269 --> 14:45.904
Really?

14:46.105 --> 14:47.908
And I think Tyler's
a little taller,

14:47.942 --> 14:49.812
and I'll go with Tyler
from Florida Georgia Line.

14:49.846 --> 14:52.050
‐Okay.
‐That's not bad.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.056
Getting Southern boy,
has never done this before,

14:55.056 --> 14:55.724
so instead of a boy bander,

14:55.891 --> 14:58.229
I'm thinking
it might be an actor.

14:58.262 --> 15:01.335
Yeah, it's an actor.
He's from Texas.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.241
He was on a show
called "Big Bang Theory,"

15:04.274 --> 15:08.048
which was about nerds,
so he's got, like, the braces,

15:08.048 --> 15:09.786
and Jim Parsons can do anything.

15:09.819 --> 15:13.560
‐ Nice.
‐ The audience is nodding
in agreement with you.

15:13.593 --> 15:14.896
‐ They like that.
‐ Yeah.

15:14.929 --> 15:18.637
You guys like that one?
Thank you.

15:18.670 --> 15:20.306
Good night, everybody.

15:21.341 --> 15:25.149
But you guys are forgetting that
we've got someone on this show

15:25.183 --> 15:27.655
who's got multiple
Oscar nominations.

15:27.688 --> 15:31.195
I was thinking, like,
a Luke or Owen Wilson,
but I don't know.

15:31.228 --> 15:33.165
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, my God!

15:33.199 --> 15:35.704
‐ Aah! I know who it is!
‐ What happened?
What's happening?

15:35.737 --> 15:38.342
I know! Take the buzzer out!
Take the buzzer out!

15:38.342 --> 15:41.281
‐ Oh!
‐ Take the buzzer out!
Take the buzzer out!

15:41.281 --> 15:42.484
Take the buzzer!

15:44.221 --> 15:46.526
‐ Whoa! Whoa!
‐ I know who it is!

15:48.429 --> 15:49.331
Be careful!

15:49.364 --> 15:51.536
These are some
big stakes here,

15:51.569 --> 15:52.505
because if you are right,

15:52.771 --> 15:57.347
the Caterpillar
must unmask immediately
and get sent home.

15:57.380 --> 16:01.155
‐Do it! Do it!
‐ The audience
is saying do it.

16:01.188 --> 16:04.795
‐ I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna press the button!
‐ No!

16:04.795 --> 16:06.966
‐
Because I'm confident! Yes!
‐No! Don't do it!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.335
How do I do it?

16:08.369 --> 16:11.609
No, no, no!
Sit down, Jenny.

16:11.643 --> 16:13.412
No! You're too young!

16:14.916 --> 16:18.222
No, Jenny! No, Jenny, no!

16:19.224 --> 16:23.199
No!

16:28.242 --> 16:31.048
Do it! Do it! Do it!

16:31.081 --> 16:32.551
The audience is saying do it.

16:32.585 --> 16:34.622
I'm gonna do it.

16:34.655 --> 16:37.093
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:40.166 --> 16:44.341
The Take It Off Buzzer
has been hit.

16:44.341 --> 16:45.343
Aw.

16:46.144 --> 16:50.587
Okay, I was thinking big actor,

16:50.621 --> 16:52.357
knows how to sing.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.227
Who would have
an Oscar nomination?

16:54.261 --> 16:59.037
And this guy was in a huge movie
called "Brokeback Mountain,"

16:59.070 --> 17:00.507
and he also has a sister,

17:00.541 --> 17:03.112
which he mentioned before,
Maggie.

17:07.053 --> 17:10.426
It's Jake Gyllenhaal. Yes!

17:10.459 --> 17:12.531
All right, Jenny.
Jenny, you sure?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.467
Yes! I know I'm right!
I know I'm right!

17:14.467 --> 17:17.173
‐ All right.
‐ Well, let's find out
if you're right.

17:17.207 --> 17:18.643
Audience, say it with me.

17:18.677 --> 17:25.389
Take it off! Take it off!

17:25.389 --> 17:26.325
Is that Jake?

17:26.358 --> 17:29.231
I know it's him! I know it is!

17:29.264 --> 17:31.536
Oh, my God,
are they doing it?

17:31.569 --> 17:35.544
‐ Take it off! Take it off!
‐ <i>♪ You, you, you</i>

17:35.577 --> 17:37.347
Take it off!

17:37.380 --> 17:41.623
‐ No. It's him!
‐ It's not Jake Gyllenhaal.

17:41.656 --> 17:45.429
‐ Oh!
‐ No!

17:45.463 --> 17:46.599
Oh!

17:46.633 --> 17:49.004
She was so confident though,
wasn't she?

17:49.037 --> 17:50.006
I'm so ashamed!

17:50.306 --> 17:54.481
Yo! I could've
told you it wasn't
Jake Gyllenhall, y'all!

17:54.481 --> 17:58.155
Well, Jenny,
because you got it wrong,

17:58.188 --> 18:00.928
you're gonna have the worst
punishment of your life.

18:00.961 --> 18:03.800
‐ What is it?
‐ You have to clean
Ken's dressing room.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.104
‐ Eww!
‐ Oh, no!

18:06.104 --> 18:09.311
‐ No! No!
‐ There's Skittles everywhere.

18:09.344 --> 18:12.383
No! I wouldn't wish that
on anybody.

18:12.383 --> 18:16.124
Okay, panel, this means
the Take It Off Buzzer

18:16.124 --> 18:18.797
is officially retired
for the season.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.333
It was exciting though,

18:20.366 --> 18:22.236
and so was that
Caterpillar performance.

18:22.270 --> 18:23.439
Let's not forget about that.

18:23.439 --> 18:24.508
Oh!

18:24.542 --> 18:27.213
We'll see you later,
not Jake Gyllenhaal.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.123
Hey, Caterpillar,
it's your friend Emily.

18:32.123 --> 18:36.264
From the red carpet
to dressing as a caterpillar

18:36.298 --> 18:40.473
on "The Masked Singer,"
I will always have your back.

18:40.507 --> 18:41.509
Good luck.

18:41.542 --> 18:44.414
All right,
back to the competition.

18:44.414 --> 18:47.821
Our next performer tonight
is Mallard.

18:47.855 --> 18:50.527
Let's dive deep
into his story.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.572
Getting to
the semi‐finals is amazing.

18:56.606 --> 18:59.879
<i>I'm up there bebopping
and scatting around the stage,</i>

18:59.912 --> 19:02.183
<i>and the audience, man,
they just get me pumped up.</i>

19:02.216 --> 19:05.389
<i>I'm loving every moment.</i>

19:05.423 --> 19:08.128
<i>The fact that
I keep going is insane,</i>

19:08.162 --> 19:10.534
because I'm 100% the underduck.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.871
<i>Tonight is gonna
be really tough.</i>

19:12.905 --> 19:16.378
<i>It's a double elimination,
and my competitors
are fantastic.</i>

19:16.378 --> 19:21.154
<i>But you never know.
I mean, hey, Mallard loves
eating banana splits.</i>

19:21.188 --> 19:23.593
‐ Oh!
‐ Shots fired.

19:23.626 --> 19:26.566
<i>Caterpillars, well, they make
good bait for fishing.</i>

19:26.599 --> 19:29.037
‐ What?
‐ <i>I'm going up against
Queen of Hearts,</i>

19:29.070 --> 19:33.145
<i>but the Mallard
is the ultimate heartbreaker.
Just ask my wife.</i>

19:33.178 --> 19:36.151
Sorry, my kids always groan
at my dad jokes.

19:36.184 --> 19:39.525
<i>Speaking of my kids,
I've got lots of them,</i>

19:39.558 --> 19:40.359
<i>and that's who
I'm doing this for.</i>

19:40.594 --> 19:44.200
‐ Ooh, he's got lots of kids.
‐ Lots of kids.

19:44.234 --> 19:47.106
<i>And I hope me being here
is a reminder to them</i>

19:47.140 --> 19:48.676
<i>to always spread their wings.</i>

19:48.710 --> 19:51.281
<i>You never know
where they make take you.</i>

20:14.528 --> 20:15.897

‐ Wow.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.808
Super duper fly, the Mallard.

21:27.841 --> 21:29.177
Mallard!

21:29.210 --> 21:32.518
Staying fly.
Talk to him, Nicole.

21:32.551 --> 21:34.655
I'm so impressed with you.
I'm not gonna lie.

21:34.688 --> 21:38.128
You're so cool.
You're the Mallard.
You're a good time.

21:38.128 --> 21:40.934
I feel like
we should all hang out
on a lake or something.

21:42.971 --> 21:44.575
Indeed, indeed.

21:44.575 --> 21:48.516
Now let's find out
what trophy Mallard uses
as a doorstop at home.

21:48.550 --> 21:52.825
Men in black,
bring out the hardware.

21:52.858 --> 21:54.829
‐ Ooh!
‐ Oh!

21:57.801 --> 21:59.839
Ooh.

21:59.872 --> 22:01.943
Ooh!

22:05.517 --> 22:08.355
‐ Barbara Walters?
‐ What?

22:08.355 --> 22:09.023
Barbara Walters,

22:09.190 --> 22:10.760
"The Ten Most
Fascinating People."

22:10.760 --> 22:11.963
Remember when
she used to do that?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.300
‐ Yes!
‐ What?

22:14.334 --> 22:18.275
Well, being known
as fascinating

22:18.308 --> 22:21.549
has always been
my true calling.

22:21.582 --> 22:24.320
‐ Ah!
‐ Fascinating.

22:24.354 --> 22:25.724
Panel, picking up
on anything?

22:25.757 --> 22:27.728
Yeah. Every week
from the beginning,

22:27.761 --> 22:29.832
I've been kinda feeling
country vibes, right?

22:29.865 --> 22:32.036
But then in the clue package,
he said he felt like

22:32.069 --> 22:33.640
he was the underduck.

22:33.673 --> 22:36.779
So, I'm thinking it could be,
like, a reality TV star.

22:36.812 --> 22:39.618
‐ Oh!
‐ And who's fascinating,
I think,

22:39.652 --> 22:41.889
is Dog the Bounty Hunter.

22:43.325 --> 22:44.662
‐ With that voice?
‐ You never know.

22:44.695 --> 22:46.599
And all those ducklings,
he's gonna need some money.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.466
And he's got
a lot of ducklings.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.640
I think that's so left,
it's actually a good guess.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.678
‐ It's so left, it's right.
‐ It's so left, it's right.

22:52.711 --> 22:56.484
Yeah, but is he
Barbara Walters fascinating?

22:56.519 --> 22:58.523
Gosh, it just‐‐ I'm...

22:58.556 --> 23:00.627
Ken, you seem really
perplexed on this one.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.531
I am, 'cause this
throws me for a loop.

23:02.564 --> 23:05.402
I'm just‐‐ you know,
is it Garth Brooks?

23:05.402 --> 23:06.772
I've‐‐ we've been there.

23:06.806 --> 23:09.511
But why would he say
he's the underduck,

23:09.545 --> 23:11.816
‐ If he was Garth Brooks,
that's his domain.
‐ Right.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.922
But maybe that's how
he thought of himself before
he got Garth famous, right?

23:14.955 --> 23:16.926
"Garth famous."
Does he have a lot
of Garth kids?

23:16.959 --> 23:20.332
He does have a lot of Garth kids
with a Garth family.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.773
‐ And a Garth wife.
‐ You Garth‐darn right.

23:23.806 --> 23:27.681
Wrap that joke up
in the aluminum foil
your jacket was made out of.

23:27.714 --> 23:30.319
Well, Cheryl, do you have
a better guess than that?

23:30.352 --> 23:32.891
Well, when I heard
"a lot of kids,"

23:32.925 --> 23:35.697
and he strikes me
as very competitive,

23:35.697 --> 23:37.668
I thought of George Foreman.

23:37.701 --> 23:41.341
George Foreman.
I mean, that's fascinating.

23:41.374 --> 23:43.445
‐ The boxer?
‐ Yes.

23:43.478 --> 23:44.815
With the grill?

23:46.351 --> 23:49.725
This might be
the craziest guess range ever.

23:49.725 --> 23:52.463
‐ Well, whoever you are,
you have us stumped.
‐ Yeah.

23:52.463 --> 23:54.735
And they did a great job
tonight, didn't they?

23:54.735 --> 23:56.672
Keep it going with Mallard.

23:56.706 --> 23:58.408
‐ Whoo!
‐Great job.

23:58.442 --> 24:00.112
Now waddle on backstage.

24:01.582 --> 24:03.418
‐ I feel like we have
really strong singers.
‐ We do.

24:03.452 --> 24:07.193
‐ But all consistently
good performances.
‐ It's gonna be hard.

24:07.226 --> 24:10.265
‐ This may be the hardest
semi‐finals yet.
‐ I know.

24:10.299 --> 24:13.205

proud of my performance,</i>

24:13.238 --> 24:16.946

Mallard left this
in his dressing room,

24:27.601 --> 24:29.605
and it's a big clue
to his identity.

24:29.638 --> 24:31.041
Can you figure it out?

24:34.347 --> 24:38.255
Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer"
and the Group B semi‐finals.

24:38.288 --> 24:42.564
Queen of Hearts is up next
and getting super personal.

24:42.597 --> 24:45.202
Hopefully it will take her
to the finals,

24:45.235 --> 24:46.906
but I'll let her explain.

24:51.381 --> 24:54.955

I was more nervous than ever.

Queen of Hearts!

They call her
the Queen of Hearts
for a reason.

27:55.984 --> 27:59.323
She definitely touched
our hearts with that one.

27:59.357 --> 28:00.827
Right, Jenny?

28:00.827 --> 28:05.837
Can I just say,
Queen of Hearts,
you have such a gift.

28:05.870 --> 28:09.043
What a beautiful voice.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.515
The way you enchanted all of us,

28:11.549 --> 28:15.322
you took us in, but you also
really touched our hearts.

28:15.322 --> 28:17.059
‐ That's right.
‐ Absolutely.

28:17.092 --> 28:21.802
This songs represents that
if it don't work out with a man,

28:21.835 --> 28:24.841
you thank God, 'cause that means
a better one's coming.

28:24.841 --> 28:26.612
‐ That's right!
‐ Come on!

28:26.645 --> 28:28.081
‐ That's right!
‐ Hey, hey, hey!

28:28.114 --> 28:29.718
Come on!
Come on, Queen of Hearts.

28:29.751 --> 28:30.553
‐ I heard that.
‐ That's right.

28:30.787 --> 28:33.491
And that's why she's
the Queen of Hearts, Nick.

28:33.526 --> 28:36.899
‐That's right.
‐Well said. Well said.

28:36.932 --> 28:40.172
Now, men in black,
bring out the hardware.

28:43.245 --> 28:45.415
Oh. I wanna see this.

28:45.449 --> 28:48.054
Ooh.

28:52.429 --> 28:54.066
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh!

28:54.100 --> 28:58.241
The Blockbuster
Entertainment Award.
A winner.

28:58.275 --> 29:01.414
That was actually,
like, a real award show
at one point in time.

29:01.447 --> 29:03.184
‐ That's right.
‐ That's right.

29:03.218 --> 29:07.761
I have to say when I won it,
I felt like a real leading lady.

29:07.794 --> 29:12.002
Whoa. But did they give out
Blockbuster Awards to singers
or to musicians as well?

29:12.036 --> 29:14.040
‐ Yeah, I think it was‐‐
‐ What about actors?

29:14.040 --> 29:15.877
‐ She did say leading lady.
‐Yeah.

29:15.910 --> 29:19.918
I get a very Southern vibe
from her. She's got
such a Southern accent.

29:19.952 --> 29:23.859
So I was thinking
my friend Kristin Chenoweth.

29:23.893 --> 29:24.962
‐ Ah!
‐Oh!

29:25.195 --> 29:29.070
‐Who is an
amazing singer and actor.
‐ Good guess.

29:29.070 --> 29:31.775
‐ She's got
an unbelievable range.
‐ Yep.

29:31.809 --> 29:33.646
‐ And she's petite.
‐I love that guess.

29:33.679 --> 29:37.554
I like that.
Maybe this is kind of
a red herring to throw us off,

29:37.587 --> 29:41.194
'cause this is a singer
who won a Blockbuster Award
in the early aughts.

29:41.227 --> 29:43.666
Off the top of my head,
just thinking of Kelly Clarkson,

29:43.699 --> 29:45.903
only because of how powerful
the voice is.

29:45.937 --> 29:47.006
She went through a divorce,

29:47.039 --> 29:48.008
but she's had
a comeback right now.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.445
‐ No, Ken.
‐ Ken, no one‐‐

29:50.479 --> 29:52.684
Listen to me.

29:52.717 --> 29:55.322
‐ Ken‐‐
‐ She's a personal friend!

29:55.355 --> 29:59.230
‐ Whoa. She's my friend.
‐ Sit down, Ken!

29:59.230 --> 30:02.236
You're telling me
to sit down, lady?
How dare you?

30:02.269 --> 30:05.309
I've been in "Transformers 3,"
"Hangover 3,"

30:05.342 --> 30:08.949
any great movie
with the last number of three.

30:08.949 --> 30:10.687
‐ Sit your ass down.
‐All right, Ken,
sit down.

30:10.720 --> 30:15.195
‐ How rude!
‐ Nicole, make some sense
out of this please.

30:15.228 --> 30:19.270
I hope it could be this person
because I love this person.

30:19.303 --> 30:20.238
I'm a massive fan.

30:20.238 --> 30:22.911
This person can sing
anything under the moon,

30:22.944 --> 30:27.721
has that beautiful break,
that cry in the voice.

30:27.754 --> 30:29.256
It could be Sia, y'all.

30:29.256 --> 30:31.862
‐ Oh, I love Sia so much.
‐That's a good one.

30:31.895 --> 30:34.968
‐ This is a Sia‐esque
type of outfit.
‐ Yeah.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.841
I could see her swinging
from the chandelier.

30:37.841 --> 30:38.976
‐ Yes!
‐ Okay.

30:38.976 --> 30:40.345
‐ I think it's Sia!
‐ No.

30:40.379 --> 30:42.116
‐ I'm changing it!
‐ Stay with Kelly Clarkson.

30:42.149 --> 30:43.853
Hey, I talked
with my life coach.

30:43.853 --> 30:46.124
She told me
to change it to Sia.

30:46.157 --> 30:48.929
Y'all keep it going
for the Queen of Hearts.

30:48.963 --> 30:50.900
Your performance
was outstanding.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.906
‐ Yeah!
‐ Stay right there.
It's time to vote.

30:53.939 --> 30:57.146
The rest of Group B,
come on out.

30:57.179 --> 30:59.684
Can you believe this is
a double elimination night?

30:59.718 --> 31:02.022
And it's the semi‐finals.
This is the cream of the crop.

31:02.056 --> 31:04.493
How we gonna lose two people?

31:06.297 --> 31:10.238
Our four singers sang
their tails off tonight,

31:10.272 --> 31:13.244
but only two can advance
to the Group B finals.

31:13.278 --> 31:17.152
And now it's time
for our studio audience,

31:17.186 --> 31:18.388
panel, and our super fans
across America

31:18.421 --> 31:22.329
to vote for their favorite
of the night.

31:22.362 --> 31:27.039
The top two will advance.
The bottom two are unmasking.

31:28.441 --> 31:30.345
The votes are in.

31:37.426 --> 31:43.071
The first singer eliminated,
headed home tonight...

31:43.071 --> 31:45.242
‐ Oh, no.
‐Is...

31:54.928 --> 31:57.567
The first singer
headed home tonight...

31:57.600 --> 31:59.604
‐ Oh, no.
‐Is...

32:07.921 --> 32:08.756
This is tough.

32:09.023 --> 32:12.162
Right. There's some real talent.
We love all of you.

32:18.408 --> 32:19.578
Mallard.

32:19.611 --> 32:21.949
‐Aw.
‐ How?

32:21.949 --> 32:24.955
‐ You guys keep it going
for Mallard one time.

32:24.955 --> 32:26.925
‐ Mallard!
‐ Mallard!

32:26.959 --> 32:29.163
Dang it.

32:29.196 --> 32:31.367
This is tough. This is brutal.

32:31.367 --> 32:36.277
To the rest
of our Group B singers,
you're safe for now.

32:36.310 --> 32:38.983
Head on to the lair
and do some praying.

32:38.983 --> 32:40.987
We'll see you in a little bit.

32:40.987 --> 32:43.859
Now, Mallard,
incredible job this season.

32:43.893 --> 32:47.099
I have to say,
we're so sad to see you go,

32:47.132 --> 32:49.270
but we're happy, 'cause we get
to see who you finally are.

32:49.303 --> 32:50.238
‐ That's right!
‐ Yeah.

32:50.272 --> 32:54.113
But first, time to fish out

32:54.113 --> 32:56.417
those panel first impression
guesses from the vault.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.054
Yeah!

33:03.131 --> 33:05.302
‐ I can't wait to hear these.
‐ All right.

33:05.335 --> 33:08.141
‐ We'll start with you, Robin.
‐ Sure.

33:08.174 --> 33:11.515
‐ Oh, yay.
‐ Your first impression
guess for the Mallard

33:11.548 --> 33:14.153
‐ was Larry the Cable Guy.
‐ Uh‐oh.

33:14.153 --> 33:16.290
Well, clearly
you're not sticking with that

33:16.290 --> 33:18.494
because he's already
been unmasked.

33:18.494 --> 33:19.965
Obviously.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.169
The thing that stuck with me was
in your earlier clue packages

33:22.202 --> 33:24.808
you mentioned a relationship
with your lovely wife

33:24.808 --> 33:27.279
from a very, very young age,
so I'm thinking Alan Jackson.

33:27.312 --> 33:29.149
‐ I'll stick with that.
‐ Wow. That's not bad.
That's good.

33:29.149 --> 33:30.018
‐Good guess.
‐ I'll stick with that.

33:30.051 --> 33:30.987
‐ That's a good guess.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.426
‐ Jenny, your first
impression guess...
‐ Oh, God.

33:34.426 --> 33:37.901
‐ Toby Keith.
‐ Oh, that's respectable.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.370
‐ Are you sticking with it?
‐ No, I'm not.

33:39.403 --> 33:42.075
‐ Oh.
‐ I really like Jason Aldean

33:42.109 --> 33:43.979
because he has a bunch of kids,

33:44.013 --> 33:46.150
he fits in that pocket,
very talented.

33:46.183 --> 33:48.989
‐ Yeah. Yeah.
‐ That's real good.

33:49.023 --> 33:54.801
Nicole, your first impression
guess was Dierks Bentley.
You sticking with it?

33:54.834 --> 33:59.443
I am not.
I think he's not the underduck,
he's the underdog, okay?

33:59.443 --> 34:03.752
Oh, dear.
Who's got a lot of children.
This person has 12 children.

34:03.786 --> 34:07.192
‐ What?
‐ So this underdog
is a hotdog, okay?

34:07.226 --> 34:10.633
‐ That's a lot.
‐ That is Dog the Bounty Hunter!

34:10.666 --> 34:12.035
Come on!

34:12.069 --> 34:13.772
‐All right.
‐Yes.

34:13.806 --> 34:17.479
All right, Ken,
your first impression guess,
Billy Ray Cyrus.

34:17.479 --> 34:20.185
‐ Oh.

34:20.218 --> 34:21.387
‐ You sticking with it?
‐ You know what?

34:21.420 --> 34:23.993
I think I am
because honestly,

34:24.026 --> 34:25.529
the performances
have been so consistent.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.967
And it said that
he has a famous family.
I mean, Miley.

34:28.001 --> 34:32.342
Right, right.
So I'm actually going to commit
to Billy Ray Cyrus.

34:32.342 --> 34:34.380
‐ Wow, that's a good guess.
‐ Gotta appreciate
that commitment.

34:34.413 --> 34:37.119
‐ Yep. Yeah.
‐ That's a good guess.

34:37.152 --> 34:40.091
All right, well,
Cheryl, you did not get
a first impression guess.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.162
‐ No. Yes.
‐ But you can get
a final guess.

34:42.195 --> 34:45.001
I still think
it is George Foreman.

34:45.035 --> 34:46.337
‐All right.
‐Nice.

34:46.370 --> 34:48.709
‐Okay.
‐ Not budging. Not budging.

34:48.709 --> 34:50.546
All great guesses.

34:50.579 --> 34:53.719
Okay, panel, let's see

being the Mallard?

35:44.486 --> 35:48.461
Well, I felt comfortable
being a mallard, yeah.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.300
When they said "duck,"
I thought, "Yeah."

35:51.334 --> 35:53.438

I was standing in that saloon,
and I was sweating,

35:59.918 --> 36:01.588
and I was like,
"I can't do this."

36:01.588 --> 36:04.326
This is crazy because
you're a country star.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.466
‐ You're a rock star.
‐ Totally.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.336
Most of the people
that you named,

36:09.370 --> 36:11.975
I'm friends with,
so I was laughing a lot

36:11.975 --> 36:15.816

"He's gonna die when he hears
that he thought I was him."

I was so nervous being

Caterpillar, I'm sorry.

It was clearly
a tight race this week.

We definitely do love you,
and we hate to see you go,

38:00.693 --> 38:02.763

Before we get
to that though, panel,

it's time for those
first impression guesses.

38:08.007 --> 38:09.811
‐ Oh, man.
‐ Uh‐oh.

38:18.595 --> 38:19.564
Wait till
you see what I wrote.

It's the worst one I've ever‐‐

38:21.300 --> 38:23.337
That's saying a lot though.

38:23.371 --> 38:26.343
Nicole Scherzinger's
first impression guess
of Caterpillar...

38:26.377 --> 38:27.914
Oh, I can't wait.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.786
...is Chris Brown.

38:30.786 --> 38:31.922
What?

38:33.759 --> 38:35.461
You know what?
I'm real.

38:35.461 --> 38:37.834
I'm a human.
I was flustered, Nick.

38:37.867 --> 38:39.737
Well, are you sticking
with Chris Brown...

38:39.737 --> 38:42.810
‐ No, gosh, no.
‐ ...now that you are calm?

38:42.844 --> 38:46.417
Especially after that country
performance with those vocals,

38:46.450 --> 38:49.489
I think that it could be
a country singer,

38:49.524 --> 38:52.597
and I think it could be someone
from Florida Georgia Line.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.632
Not bad.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.501
So I'm going with Tyler
from Florida Georgia Line.

38:55.536 --> 38:57.640
‐ There it is.
‐Okay.

38:58.942 --> 39:00.713
All right, Ken,

39:00.746 --> 39:04.353
your first impression guess
was Aaron Carter.

39:04.386 --> 39:05.956
‐ Oh.
‐Oh, that's good.

39:05.956 --> 39:07.627
Not bad.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.496
‐ Are you sticking with it?
‐I am not.

39:09.496 --> 39:11.968
This clue tonight
with the bestie,

39:12.002 --> 39:13.839
with Emily Hampshire,

39:13.839 --> 39:16.010
this has to be Dan Levy

39:16.043 --> 39:18.014
because he can do it all.

39:18.047 --> 39:18.882
He can sing, he can dance.

39:19.116 --> 39:20.986
That's a great‐‐ that's
the best guess you've had.

39:20.986 --> 39:23.324
‐ Thank you.
‐ I hope it is.

39:23.324 --> 39:27.567
All right, now, Jenny,
your first impression guess
was Brian Littrell.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.205
‐ That's very good.
‐ It's definitely not
Jake Gyllenhaal, everybody,

39:30.238 --> 39:35.516
‐ just so you know.
‐ Hold on. Let me mark that off.
"Not Jake Gyllenhaal."

39:35.549 --> 39:40.091
But I did appreciate when
the audience kinda went, "Ooh!",

39:40.124 --> 39:42.429
when I said Owen Wilson, so...

39:42.462 --> 39:43.632
‐Oh.
‐Ooh.

39:43.665 --> 39:45.769
‐ I know. I know!
‐ Did it again.

39:45.803 --> 39:47.807
So I'm gonna stick with it.
Owen Wilson.

39:47.807 --> 39:50.879
‐ All right.
‐Wow. Wow.

39:51.881 --> 39:53.017
Robin, you were in that
boy bander world as well.

39:53.317 --> 39:57.793
Yeah, I'm embarrassed
about this because I got
my boy banders mixed up.

39:57.827 --> 40:02.469
My first guess was supposed
to be AJ McLean, but I wrote...

40:02.503 --> 40:04.641
‐ Howie D.
That's the bad boy.
‐Yeah.

40:04.674 --> 40:08.649
Yeah, got my Howies
and my AJs mixed up there.

40:08.682 --> 40:11.655
But I still feel
in my heart of hearts

40:11.688 --> 40:13.124
that this could be AJ McLean,

40:13.157 --> 40:15.529
which was my original
embarrassing wrong name guess.

40:15.562 --> 40:17.032
I like AJ's name.

40:18.367 --> 40:20.606
All right, now, Cheryl?

40:20.639 --> 40:24.346
Okay, so Caterpillar seems like
he can really switch it up,

40:24.379 --> 40:26.851
and he's fooling people,
he's a very good actor.

40:26.851 --> 40:31.895
‐ Yeah.
‐ And I still think that
it's Jim Parsons.

40:31.928 --> 40:33.532
‐ That's a good guess.
‐That's a good one.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.501
‐ Great guess.
‐ Great guess.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.673
