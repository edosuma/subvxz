WEBVTT

00:07.775 --> 00:09.743
(female announcer)
And now we're back
to "The Magic Van."

00:09.777 --> 00:10.744
(horn honks)

00:10.778 --> 00:12.880
(students chatting)

00:12.913 --> 00:14.248
(girl)
I wonder what she'll do today.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.884
Good morning, students!

00:16.917 --> 00:20.888
It's me, your whimsically
kooky teacher, Ms. Dazzle.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.757
(all)
Good morning, Ms. Dazzle!

00:23.791 --> 00:27.761
Who's ready to go on another
wondrous learning adventure

00:27.795 --> 00:29.330
in my Magic Van?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.531
Heck, yeah!

00:30.564 --> 00:32.233
Last week
I rode a dinosaur.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.601
I freed a slave.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.902
Only one, though.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.538
Let's find out what
we'll be learning today.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.639
Get ready to catch.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.409
Christopher Columbus!

00:42.543 --> 00:43.777
Ancient Egypt.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.115
Ow!
What does it say, Ronald?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.220
(gunfire, man screaming)

00:52.253 --> 00:53.621
Grammar.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.356
It says, uh, grammar.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.058
(giggles)
Delightful.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.627
Today, class, we'll
be learning

00:59.660 --> 01:01.929
about heroic
Christopher Columbus,

01:01.962 --> 01:03.531
exotic ancient Egypt,

01:03.564 --> 01:05.766
and the ironclad
rules of grammar.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.269
(all gasping)

01:09.803 --> 01:11.272
Hate to interrupt,
Ms. Dazzle,

01:11.305 --> 01:13.274
but the lessons we teach kids
about these topics

01:13.307 --> 01:14.875
are wildly inaccurate.
(crashing)

01:14.908 --> 01:17.778
Who in the gumdrop
flip-flops are you?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.313
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

01:19.347 --> 01:21.482
longtime viewer,
first-time ruiner.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.484
And this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:23.517 --> 01:24.552
**

01:24.585 --> 01:25.619
(gasps)

01:25.653 --> 01:27.087
**

01:27.121 --> 01:28.122
(screams)

01:28.156 --> 01:30.924
**

01:33.161 --> 01:34.962
Oh, this is so exciting.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.665
I watched "The Magic Van"
every day as a kid.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.766
And as an adult.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.301
I don't have
many hobbies.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.504
Mr. Conover, I am the magical
host of the show.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.906
So I will be teaching
these children.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.541
Now sit down
and wrap it up.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.911
Okay, class, today

01:50.944 --> 01:53.314
we'll learn about
Christopher Columbus,

01:53.347 --> 01:55.649
the heroic explorer
who discovered America

01:55.683 --> 01:58.519
and proved the Earth
was round.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.921
Actually, Columbus was
an incompetent buffoon

02:00.954 --> 02:03.023
who never even
set foot in America.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.024
(deflating)

02:04.057 --> 02:05.526
Hush, hush.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.695
We all know
Columbus wasn't perfect.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.197
That's an understatement.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.599
The real story of Columbus
is even worse

02:11.632 --> 02:13.133
and weirder
than you think.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.735
All aboard the Magic Van!

02:16.704 --> 02:19.039
Sorry, first-time driver.
Let's go!

02:19.072 --> 02:20.541
(horn honks)
Come on, guys!

02:20.574 --> 02:22.843
Let's follow this strange
adult into his van.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.880
Listen, you bargain-basement
Beakman,

02:26.914 --> 02:28.682
if you pull
that magic lever,

02:28.716 --> 02:29.983
I swear to--
Here we go!

02:30.017 --> 02:32.220
(all)
Whoa!

02:32.253 --> 02:33.621
(horn honks)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.956
First of all, Columbus
couldn't have discovered

02:35.989 --> 02:37.358
that the Earth was round

02:37.391 --> 02:40.528
because in his time, it was
already common knowledge.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.729
Globes for sale.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.732
Perfectly ordinary globes
for sale.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.234
Whoa.
What?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.802
Then why did it take
until 1492

02:48.836 --> 02:51.071
for anyone to sail
the ocean blue?

02:51.104 --> 02:54.074
Simple, back then they didn't
know the Americas existed.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.743
So navigators thought
there was no way

02:55.776 --> 02:58.412
a ship could make it all
the way from Europe to Asia.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.217
So Columbus set sail
because he was brave.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.019
Nope, he set sail
because he was a doofus

03:06.053 --> 03:07.821
who was terrible at math.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.523
Instead of trusting
the experts,

03:09.557 --> 03:12.560
Columbus believed the Earth
was thousands of miles smaller

03:12.593 --> 03:14.562
than it actually was.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.264
Fools, all of them!

03:16.297 --> 03:19.333
My math says the Earth
is teeny tiny

03:19.367 --> 03:21.068
and shaped like a pear.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.837
And at the top,
it has a succulent nipple.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.906
He actually believed that?

03:25.939 --> 03:28.342
Yes, I actually believe this.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.879
I can sail from Europe to India
in a matter of days.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.414
That's extremely wrong.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.584
It took years for Columbus
to convince the king and queen

03:36.617 --> 03:38.185
his plan didn't suck.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.255
But competition in the spice
trade was getting intense.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.557
So Ferdinand and Isabella
were desperate to find

03:43.591 --> 03:45.959
a new way
to get their fix.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.596
The Earth is tiny
and also a pear.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.030
Give me money, please.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.732
This man is an idiot.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.134
(sniffing)
I don't care.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.470
Fine, give this moron
the bare minimum,

03:56.504 --> 03:58.639
90 dumb men
and three dumb ships.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.474
If you die, who cares?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.876
Right, and that's when
Columbus showed them all

04:02.910 --> 04:04.812
and became a hero.
But--

04:04.845 --> 04:07.281
You know what happens
to mouthy students?

04:07.315 --> 04:08.582
They get extra credit?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.951
I turn them into iguanas.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.820
Say hi, Edward.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.555
(straining)
Kill me.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.923
(gulps)

04:15.956 --> 04:18.058
Now, children,
that's the Nina, the Pinta,

04:18.091 --> 04:19.560
and the Santa Maria,

04:19.593 --> 04:22.663
the ships Columbus sailed
to discover America.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.500
I'm really sorry,
Ms. Dazzle,

04:26.534 --> 04:29.337
but Columbus never
set foot in America.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.505
Of all the modern-day countries
Columbus made it to,

04:31.539 --> 04:33.841
like Cuba, Haiti,
and the Dominican Republic,

04:33.874 --> 04:36.910
none of them were
in the United States.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.978
Okay, fine.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.513
Then, uh, Columbus
discovered Haiti

04:39.547 --> 04:40.681
and the Dominican Republic.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.015
Sure, he did.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.251
If you don't count the
quarter-million Taino people

04:44.284 --> 04:45.519
that lived there already.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.989
Uh, occupied.
Someone lives here.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.791
Right, I know this part.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.660
He thought he made it
to India.

04:52.693 --> 04:56.864
Aha, this is India
and these people are Indians.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.667
I will be rich
in spices and gold.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.769
(laughs)
What a silly mistake.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.037
Yes, if by "silly,"
you mean brutal,

05:04.071 --> 05:07.508
and by "a mistake,"
you mean one of several.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.677
The Taino treated Columbus
and his crew

05:09.710 --> 05:11.712
with the utmost hospitality.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.347
Hug?
(groans)

05:13.381 --> 05:16.384
We need reinforcements!

05:16.417 --> 05:18.552
Columbus repaid their kindness

05:18.586 --> 05:22.289
by returning with 17 ships
and 1,200 men

05:22.322 --> 05:25.359
so he could enslave the Taino
and steal their gold.

05:25.393 --> 05:28.128
There was only one problem,
they didn't have any.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.564
You, gold.
Now!

05:30.598 --> 05:34.568
Oh, I want to help,
but what is gold?

05:34.602 --> 05:37.037
(Adam)
This infuriated Columbus.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.007
And soon, he and his crew
began to slaughter them.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.076
(people screaming)

05:43.110 --> 05:45.746
This is very inappropriate
for me to see.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.348
(Adam)
Columbus's regime was
so senselessly brutal

05:48.382 --> 05:52.052
that by 1542, the Taino
population on the island

05:52.085 --> 05:54.254
had fallen to 200.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.322
(groans)

05:55.355 --> 05:57.357
I can't believe it.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.227
I had no clue that Columbus
was this cruel.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.731
But after this, he must've gone
on to do great things, hmm?

06:03.764 --> 06:06.734
Nope, this was literally
all he did.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.268
He didn't discover America

06:08.301 --> 06:10.103
and he didn't prove
the Earth was round.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.939
He just bounced around
the Caribbean,

06:11.972 --> 06:14.241
slaughtered a bunch
of innocent people,

06:14.274 --> 06:17.110
and died thinking
he had made it to India.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.681
Hashtag, no regrets.
(groans)

06:20.714 --> 06:22.450
Holy crow.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.952
Then why do we learn
about this guy in school?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.520
Oh, great question.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.957
For centuries, Columbus
was a historical footnote.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.461
But that changed in 1828
when Washington Irving,

06:33.494 --> 06:35.228
the author of
"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"

06:35.262 --> 06:36.464
and other tall tales,

06:36.497 --> 06:39.800
wrote the first English-language
biography of Columbus.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.969
"Columbus was
a murderous failure"?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.871
That ain't gonna sell copies.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.140
Let's say he was a brave genius
who proved the Earth was round

06:47.174 --> 06:49.409
and discovered America.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.945
Hmm, seems believable.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.981
And Irving's myth
caught on big-time

06:54.014 --> 06:57.150
when some new Americans
were searching for a hero.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.586
Throughout the 19th century,

06:58.619 --> 07:01.288
a surge of Italians
immigrated to America,

07:01.321 --> 07:02.790
where they were persecuted

07:02.823 --> 07:04.658
and treated like
they didn't belong.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.795
Dah! This is New York City.
We hate pizza.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.130
And we'll always
hate pizza.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.166
To help prove Italians were
a part of the American story,

07:13.200 --> 07:16.670
Italian-Americans latched
onto Irving's version
of Columbus

07:16.704 --> 07:19.006
and promoted it
like crazy.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.341
Ay, we know a guy
that knows a guy

07:21.374 --> 07:24.678
that discovered America
and is Italian.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.247
Huh, I guess Italians
are great.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.583
This guy deserves
his own holiday.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.951
(Adam)
And that's the true story

07:30.984 --> 07:33.286
of how an incompetent
and vicious nobody

07:33.320 --> 07:36.189
became the national hero
we celebrate today.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.290
Enough!

07:37.324 --> 07:40.127
Mr. Conover,
this is my show.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.996
And while I suppose
this information
is factually accurate,

07:43.030 --> 07:46.366
your little diversions deviate
from today's lesson plan.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.035
I am the captain now.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.870
Ugh, no, wait!

07:49.903 --> 07:52.372
Ah, I'll catch up with them
in ancient Egypt.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.775
(chuckles)
Plenty to ruin there.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.744
Uh-oh.
Whoa...

08:00.814 --> 08:03.116
Welcome to ancient Egypt,
students.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.887
Today we'll explore
the tomb of King Tut,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.889
the greatest pharaoh
of them all.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
Did someone say explore?

08:10.724 --> 08:11.725
(students)
Adam!

08:11.759 --> 08:13.694
Ruiner, no ruining.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.229
Lo siento, but Tutankhamun
was actually

08:16.263 --> 08:18.131
one of the least
important pharaohs.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.735
No way, pal.
Tut did great things.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.236
Hey, amigos at home,

08:23.270 --> 08:26.139
can you name one of King Tut's
accomplishments?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.407
(crickets chirping)

08:27.440 --> 08:29.409
That's right,
there are none.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.079
I'll show you on my scroll
of pharaohs.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.747
(scroll screaming)

08:33.781 --> 08:35.849
Tutankhamun was only
nine years old

08:35.883 --> 08:37.250
when he became pharaoh.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.652
And since he was
so young,

08:38.686 --> 08:40.420
other people did
the ruling for him.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.355
(grunts)
Out of my way, baby!

08:42.389 --> 08:44.024
Pharaoh's a big-boy job.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.394
(Adam)
And he died at the ripe
old age of 19.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.563
There was nothing notable
about his reign.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.566
In the annals of the pharaohs,
Tutankhamun was a blip.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.403
Even his tomb was smaller
and less ornate than the others.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.939
King Tut,
you're basic.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.941
Rest in peace,
or whatevs.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.175
(scroll screaming)

09:02.209 --> 09:04.578
Okay, senor,
if King Tut was so basic,

09:04.612 --> 09:07.615
then why is he the most famous
of all the pharaohs today.

09:07.648 --> 09:11.051
Good question,
and the answer is real weird.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.920
I'll show you.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.054
Whoa.
Is that thing safe?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.224
Looks like it was made
in the '60s.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.059
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no...

09:20.728 --> 09:22.896
But it's my birthday.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.135
(Adam)
In 1798, after Napoleon
invaded Egypt,

09:28.168 --> 09:31.271
he went totally gaga
for the ancient kingdoms.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.540
He brought in scholars
to document their findings

09:33.573 --> 09:36.243
and they helped themselves
to whatever they wanted,

09:36.276 --> 09:39.546
even returning to France
with a severed mummy head

09:39.579 --> 09:42.082
for Napoleon's wife.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.384
(Napoleon)
Oh, Josephine will love this.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.754
When images of the findings
reached Europe,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.956
scholars went cuckoo
for these corpses.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.992
And over the next century,
hundreds of rich Europeans

09:52.025 --> 09:55.328
started excavating Egyptian
cultural sites like crazy,

09:55.362 --> 09:57.931
pilfering thousands
of priceless treasures.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.233
Check out
this sexy-ass statue.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.002
I'm gonna put it
next to my toilet.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.837
(Ms. Dazzle gasps)
It gets worse.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.573
Rich Europeans even held
mummy parties

10:06.606 --> 10:08.508
where they unwrapped
the ancient remains

10:08.541 --> 10:10.110
as a party game.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.779
Last person to unwrap
the mummy

10:11.812 --> 10:14.181
has to grind it up
and snort it.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.450
Oh, fish sticks.
This is very disturbing.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.653
But what does it have
to do with King Tut.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.854
A lot, actually.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.924
Because this Egyptomania fad
led to the excavation

10:23.957 --> 10:26.526
of over 30 pharaohs' tombs.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.196
Except for one,
the tomb of Tutankhamun.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.198
Tut was so unimportant
that his tomb

10:31.231 --> 10:33.867
was pretty much ignored
by grave robbers.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.871
That's why, when Howard Carter
uncovered it in 1922,

10:37.905 --> 10:39.506
it was so well-preserved,

10:39.539 --> 10:42.943
that over 5,000 separate items
were found inside.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.512
(panting)

10:45.545 --> 10:49.116
I was in there
for thousands of years.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.484
Why did no one
come back for me?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.386
Why didn't I die?

10:53.420 --> 10:56.556
The discovery of the tomb
made international headlines.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.892
But not because Tut was
historically significant.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.895
It was because of that
ancient Egyptian bling.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.832
A brand-new Egyptomania
craze began.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.834
And the cool kids
of the Roaring '20s

11:06.867 --> 11:11.071
went crazy for Egyptian-style
clothing, makeup, and jewelry.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.573
Basically, Egyptomania
was the 1920s version

11:13.606 --> 11:16.543
of Coachella kids wearing
Native American headdresses.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.478
This Egyptian stuff
is sick.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.814
Let's make
a selfie painting.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.916
And in the 1970s,
Tut's artifacts

11:22.950 --> 11:25.886
made a sick city
museum tour in America.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.155
Eight million people
saw the exhibit.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.124
An executive for the
Metropolitan Museum of Art
even said...

11:37.798 --> 11:39.032
Mmm...
(kissing sounds)

11:39.066 --> 11:41.268
Uh, is this what sex is?

11:41.301 --> 11:44.271
I don't know,
but I hope not.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.372
Wait.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.074
So King Tut is only famous

11:47.107 --> 11:49.009
because of some weird
fetishization

11:49.042 --> 11:50.677
of Egyptian culture?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.279
Yep, and that's a shame.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.614
Because ancient Egypt has
so much more to teach us

11:54.647 --> 11:56.416
than just mummies and tombs.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.018
They were one
of the first civilizations

11:58.051 --> 12:00.187
to independently develop
their own writing system.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.089
They revolutionized
agriculture

12:02.122 --> 12:03.957
by developing
the ox-drawn plow

12:03.991 --> 12:05.793
and irrigation systems.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.896
They even invented
the first yearly calendar.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.463
Huh, I love calendars.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.132
Quit while you're ahead.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.134
Compared to this
rich history,

12:14.167 --> 12:16.804
King Tut only deserves
an honorable mention.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.639
Huh, you didactic doofus.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.142
Fine, King Tut was basic.
Columbus was a maniac.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.112
Are you done?
Well, there's always
more to learn.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.214
Enough, I'm taking back
my show.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.116
A many, many children
rely on me

12:29.149 --> 12:30.317
to make learning fun.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.453
And I'm not gonna let some
basic-cable bozo stop me.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.822
Get in the van, kids!

12:36.023 --> 12:39.126
Well, history is
a fuzzy discipline.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.561
But you know what
never changes? Grammar.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.164
Wait, don't you want to hear
about how grammar rules

12:44.197 --> 12:46.099
are essentially pointless?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.334
No?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.635
(sighs)

12:48.668 --> 12:50.871
This is why you should never
meet your heroes.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.677
Okay, class, we're finally free
of that pompadoured punk.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.711
We're here!

13:00.213 --> 13:01.481
Where is here?

13:01.514 --> 13:02.749
Is this heaven?

13:02.782 --> 13:06.820
Not heaven, Ronald,
somewhere even better.

13:06.854 --> 13:11.959
* Welcome to the world
of grammar *

13:11.992 --> 13:15.028
Hey, Tonya, are you still
hanging out with Tyler?

13:15.062 --> 13:16.629
Nah, he ghosted me.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.265
I think I gotta
defriend him.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.366
(sighs)

13:19.399 --> 13:22.202
* Ghost is not a verb

13:22.235 --> 13:25.372
* Defriend is not
a word *

13:25.405 --> 13:29.943
* Unless you are a fool
you must follow grammar rules *

13:29.977 --> 13:33.013
* Proper English
is the key *

13:33.046 --> 13:35.348
* Might I add
actually *

13:35.382 --> 13:36.950
(children gasping)
Hmm.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.786
* Language is too complex

13:39.819 --> 13:43.190
* To be pinned down
with such strict laws of-- **

13:43.223 --> 13:45.792
Ugh, sorry, I left my rhyming
dictionary at home.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.827
No, no, not this time.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.630
Grammar rules
are logical and exact.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.565
Everybody loves
to be corrected.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.701
I can tell you
from experience, they don't.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.636
The fact is,
while the grammar police

13:56.669 --> 13:59.739
act like these rules were
laid down by God herself,

13:59.772 --> 14:01.909
they can change and morph
over time,

14:01.942 --> 14:03.410
just like language does.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.213
How dare you!
The rules are the rules.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.747
She ain't listenin'.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.349
Don't say
"ain't," dear.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.517
It's low-class.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.885
Funny you say that.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.487
Up until the 1800s, "ain't"
was a proper contraction

14:14.521 --> 14:17.424
of "am not," used
by the upper class.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.160
Are you attending
Lady Margaret's soiree?

14:20.193 --> 14:23.230
I won't, I shan't,
I ain't.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.865
It wasn't until the lower
classes began to use it

14:25.899 --> 14:27.500
that the word
fell out of fashion

14:27.534 --> 14:29.602
and was deemed
bad English.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.771
I ain't going either.
What luck.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.340
Now we can
hang out together.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.942
How vulgar!

14:34.975 --> 14:36.910
I'll never use
that word again.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.678
(both)
Shun, shun, shun!

14:38.711 --> 14:40.580
And now, when someone
says "ain't,"

14:40.613 --> 14:43.050
grammar nuts
literally go insane.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.585
(laughs)
Aha, I got you now.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.955
You said "literally"
when you meant "figuratively."

14:47.988 --> 14:50.123
That's actually the opposite
of what you meant.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.192
It's wrong
and it's always been wrong.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.493
So be gone.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.529
Whoa!
Wrong again, Ms. Dazzle.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.031
People have been using
"literally"

14:58.065 --> 15:01.801
as a hyperbolic intensifier
for literally hundreds of years.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.036
Hogwash.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.137
Charles Dickens used it.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.408
So did Charlotte Bronte.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.745
Not to mention Mark Twain,
James Joyce,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.982
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
and Vladimir Nabokov.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.984
(screaming)

15:17.017 --> 15:19.919
But those are the English
language's greatest writers.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.821
Didn't they know
about the rule?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.057
The fact is, there was
no documented rule

15:24.091 --> 15:27.160
against using "literally"
this way until 1909,

15:27.194 --> 15:29.329
when author Ambrose Bierce
wrote a grammar book

15:29.362 --> 15:30.998
titled "Write It Right."

15:31.031 --> 15:34.567
* To those who use "literally"
when you mean "figuratively" *

15:34.601 --> 15:37.270
* It is bad enough
to exaggerate *

15:37.304 --> 15:40.173
* But to affirm the truth
of the exaggeration *

15:40.207 --> 15:42.275
* Is intolerable

15:42.309 --> 15:43.977
Yes, I agree
with this good man.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.846
But you might not like
his other rules.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.681
* Lunch is not a noun

15:48.715 --> 15:50.250
* Say luncheon

15:50.283 --> 15:52.852
Well, ha-ha, that's
a little old-fashioned.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.821
* Never say pants

15:54.854 --> 15:56.923
* Say trousers

15:56.956 --> 16:00.027
Okay, Bierce.
No one says "trousers."

16:00.060 --> 16:03.130
* Women make a grave mistake

16:03.163 --> 16:06.533
* When they misuse
"aggravate" *

16:06.566 --> 16:08.601
Now that's too much.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.038
You just aggravated
the wrong woman.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.972
(growls)
(screams)

16:13.006 --> 16:16.209
Why are his grammar rules
so different from mine?

16:16.243 --> 16:19.179
Simple, the English language
just doesn't have

16:19.212 --> 16:21.548
one single
definitive authority.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.383
Yes, it does,
the dictionary.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.352
It tells you what is right
and what is wrong.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.187
And that's that.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.989
Sorry, but dictionaries
aren't the language police.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.159
Oh, it's Anne Curzan,
professor of English

16:32.192 --> 16:33.493
at the University of Michigan.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.063
Hi, Ms. Dazzle, the people
who edit dictionaries

16:36.096 --> 16:37.397
really like new words.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.232
They aren't trying to keep them
out of dictionaries.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.900
They would say that what
they're trying to do

16:40.933 --> 16:43.570
is keep up with us
as we change the language.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.673
But then how am I supposed
to tell who's right and wrong?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.576
It's not about being
right or wrong.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.912
There are different
but perfectly valid
varieties of English.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.514
Just take American English,

16:54.547 --> 16:55.915
where you've got
lots of varieties

16:55.948 --> 16:58.185
such as Southern American
English, Appalachian English,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.720
African-American English,
the Ocracoke brogue.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.091
These "non-standard" varieties
give us really useful tools

17:04.124 --> 17:05.325
for communicating.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.494
As second-person
plural pronouns go,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.729
standard American English
is limited to "you"

17:09.762 --> 17:11.331
for both singular
and plural.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.233
But "y'all"
is a very handy way

17:13.266 --> 17:15.001
of addressing a whole
group all at once.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.837
And some common words
in "non-standard" English

17:17.870 --> 17:20.740
are actually more logical
than in standard English.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.109
In Appalachian English,

17:22.142 --> 17:23.676
you'll hear "teached"
and "catched,"

17:23.710 --> 17:25.712
which follow the rule
for making past tense

17:25.745 --> 17:27.280
with a final E-D.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.916
Here's another example, this one
from African-American English.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.851
The word I have in mind
is "hisself."

17:31.884 --> 17:34.053
I use "hisself"
all the time.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.922
I'm sorry,
but that's not right.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.657
It should be "himself."

17:40.093 --> 17:42.695
All these pronouns use
the possessive plus "self."

17:42.729 --> 17:44.464
But check out "hisself."

17:44.497 --> 17:47.200
It's consistent with the rule
and makes rational sense.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.236
But sadly,
when people use it,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.804
they're often told that
they're using "bad grammar."

17:51.838 --> 17:54.474
Oh, I never thought
about it that way.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.644
So, grammar rules
are meaningless?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.479
All this is for naught?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.114
Not at all.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.283
It's useful to have
a written standard.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.651
It allows us to communicate

18:04.684 --> 18:06.986
across all these different
varieties of English.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.757
At the same time, the ability
to coat-switch between dialects

18:10.790 --> 18:12.792
is a very valuable tool.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.927
I wish our English classes
would teach children

18:14.961 --> 18:17.464
to value those differences,
not stifle them.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.400
Now you're talkin'
my language.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.502
Now it's time
for the expert rap.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.736
Hit it, Anne.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.239
Yeah, literally nobody
wants to hear that.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.074
Later, Conover.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.310
Oh, my.
Oh, what have I done?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.179
I've locked the children
into rigid grammar rules,

18:32.212 --> 18:34.514
spread a frivolous
history of Egypt,

18:34.547 --> 18:37.317
and glorified an incompetent,
murderous loser.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.187
I-- I'm a bad teacher.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.421
(sobbing)

18:41.454 --> 18:42.655
Look, there is
a bright side.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.693
I don't deserve this show
or these magic powers.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.629
I don't deserve
the Magic Van.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.831
Leave me
and never come back.

18:51.864 --> 18:52.999
(squeaking)

18:53.032 --> 18:54.601
Good-bye, students.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.305
Adam, you can teach them
better than I ever could.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.372
(sobbing)

18:59.406 --> 19:01.374
Ms. Dazzle, wait!

19:01.408 --> 19:05.044
Come on, kids, we have to show
her why she is a good teacher.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.380
All aboard Adam's magic
folding bicycle.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.883
(bicycle bell rings)
To the positive takeaway
we go!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.485
(crashing)

19:12.519 --> 19:14.987
Sorry, I am
a really bad driver.

19:17.357 --> 19:21.328
**

19:21.361 --> 19:23.029
Hello, we are here
at The Farm LA,

19:23.062 --> 19:25.198
"Adam Ruins Everything"'s
post-production facility.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.033
And I'm here
with Anne Curzan.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.201
Thank you
for being here, Anne.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.469
I'm so pleased to be here.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.638
I had no idea
I wanted to be a bookworm...

19:31.671 --> 19:34.474
(Adam laughs)
...until I became a bookworm!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.477
How do you wish that
we taught grammar in school

19:37.510 --> 19:39.746
differently than
most people were taught it?

19:39.779 --> 19:43.716
I wish we taught grammar
more as how language works.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.185
Part of that would be,
where do languages come from?

19:46.219 --> 19:48.054
What are the rules
of school English?

19:48.087 --> 19:50.257
What are the rules
of texting English?
Mm-hmm.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.226
And figure out when
and how to switch among them.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.496
It's a much more empowering
and fun way to teach it.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.764
And you put those
right next to each other,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.031
school English
and texting English.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.334
All those kinds of English
follow rules.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.770
There are very intricate
rules of texting.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.105
For example,
now the period is angry.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.675
Oh, yeah, when someone
writes you a text

20:08.708 --> 20:10.243
and there's, and there's
a period at the end,

20:10.277 --> 20:12.111
they're mad,
and everybody knows that.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.446
Periods are
for when you're angry.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.183
Everybody under 30
knows that.
Okay.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.252
Yes, 'cause my mom
doesn't know that.
Exactly.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.554
Because she'll, because
she'll write me texts...

20:23.290 --> 20:25.792
Period. And I'm like,
why is she so mad?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.560
That's right,
and I love that example

20:27.594 --> 20:30.263
because it is-- here you've
got an older generation

20:30.297 --> 20:33.065
who doesn't know the rules.
Yeah.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.268
In the same way that younger
generations are learning

20:35.302 --> 20:37.136
the rules of academic writing

20:37.169 --> 20:39.472
and all the power
that can come with that,

20:39.506 --> 20:42.141
some of us older folks need
to learn the rules of texting

20:42.174 --> 20:44.210
so that we can
control the power

20:44.243 --> 20:45.645
that comes with being
a good texter.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.549
My message to older folks
would be, it's not chaos.
Yeah.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.818
That I think that people
think, oh, texting,

20:51.851 --> 20:54.053
these kids don't care
about punctuation.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.755
They don't care
about the written language.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.457
But actually,
they care a lot.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.892
Should it be two exclamation
marks or three?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.394
A winky face
or a smiley face?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.262
Do we put the period or no?
Mm-hmm.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.831
That they're thinking
very carefully

21:04.864 --> 21:07.667
about what really are
rhetorical choices.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.168
Well, we'll be back
in just a second

21:09.201 --> 21:11.338
with more Anne Curzan
and more "Adam Ruins Everything"

21:11.371 --> 21:12.505
right after this.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.578
**

21:18.611 --> 21:20.146
Hello, I'm back
with Anne Curzan

21:20.179 --> 21:21.948
talking about
the English language.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.916
So how do you feel
in your daily life

21:23.950 --> 21:25.151
if someone corrects you,
right?

21:25.184 --> 21:26.686
Like my friends used
to give me a hard time

21:26.719 --> 21:28.488
about "I am well,"
not "I'm good."

21:28.521 --> 21:30.323
And that used to--
it bothered me so much!

21:30.357 --> 21:32.592
First of all, I'd like
to say you can say both

21:32.625 --> 21:34.160
"I am good" and "I am well."
Yeah.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.462
And they mean
something different.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.829
Oh!
Right?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.098
"I am well" means
I'm healthy.
Yeah.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.534
"I'm good" means
I'm in a good place.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.869
Like I'm good.
Yeah.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.936
Here's a phrase
that I love,

21:43.970 --> 21:45.538
"To go grammando."

21:45.572 --> 21:47.039
So "grammando" is a word

21:47.073 --> 21:48.675
that was introduced
by Lizzie Skurnick

21:48.708 --> 21:50.176
in "The New York Times"
Sunday magazine.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.445
And "grammando"
she defines as a noun

21:52.479 --> 21:55.314
that is a person who corrects
other people's grammar.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.216
I think all of us have
experienced it,

21:57.249 --> 22:00.052
when someone corrects
your grammar or your usage,

22:00.086 --> 22:03.222
it makes you want
to not talk.
Yeah, yeah.

22:03.255 --> 22:06.025
That your first reaction is
to go, oh, I'm-- I'm done,

22:06.058 --> 22:07.827
because they're listening
to how I'm talking

22:07.860 --> 22:09.128
as opposed
to what I'm saying.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.830
And you'll see it
in arguments online

22:10.863 --> 22:12.365
where people are arguing
about sports

22:12.399 --> 22:13.466
or they're arguing
about something.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.734
And then when
they get really angry

22:14.767 --> 22:15.868
and they want
to shut it down,

22:15.902 --> 22:17.236
they'll say, "I don't
need to listen to you

22:17.269 --> 22:19.406
because you don't even know
how to use an apostrophe."

22:19.439 --> 22:21.908
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Right? And game over.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.043
That's so funny, that's like
every YouTube comment

22:24.076 --> 22:26.145
devolved into an argument
about, about like

22:26.178 --> 22:28.515
whether the person used
the right version of "your."

22:28.548 --> 22:31.684
There are certainly times
as a teacher, with writing,

22:31.718 --> 22:33.686
that you will wanna
make sure that students

22:33.720 --> 22:35.254
control standard varieties.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.090
But the power of going
grammando on someone

22:38.124 --> 22:41.494
is something we need to wield
very, very carefully.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.195
Thank you so much
for coming on the show, Anne.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.264
And now, back to
"Adam Ruins Everything."

22:48.801 --> 22:49.936
(crashing)
Oh!

22:49.969 --> 22:51.538
Ms. Dazzle!

22:51.571 --> 22:53.840
Ms. Dazzle is
a fraud, children.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.577
I've taught you lies
and I deserve the worst.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.579
Send me to TV jail!

22:59.612 --> 23:02.348
All I ever wanted to do
was get kids in a van

23:02.381 --> 23:04.116
and show them something new.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.118
Oof, not the best
way to put it.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.754
But Ms. Dazzle,

23:07.787 --> 23:10.957
the world needs passionate
teachers like you.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.625
As a kid, watching your show

23:12.659 --> 23:14.627
helped me get excited
about learning.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.463
And despite the fact
that your listen plan

23:16.496 --> 23:18.397
wasn't totally up to date,

23:18.431 --> 23:20.433
your students actually
learned a lot today.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.568
They did?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.936
I learned that Columbus
was a brutal moron

23:23.970 --> 23:26.272
who was popularized
by a writer of tall tales.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.775
I learned where
grammar rules come from.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.577
I learned I can be
alone with my thoughts

23:30.610 --> 23:31.911
for thousands of years

23:31.944 --> 23:33.880
and that "hell"
is just a word.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.883
Behind every lesson plan,
there's a deeper story

23:36.916 --> 23:39.418
of why we teach kids
the things we do.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.820
When we peel back the layers

23:40.853 --> 23:42.655
and learn the history
behind the lesson,

23:42.689 --> 23:44.457
that's when
learning becomes fun.

23:44.491 --> 23:47.159
And that kind of curiosity
will benefit these kids

23:47.193 --> 23:48.394
for the rest
of their lives.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.096
Oh, you're right.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.998
There's still
so much more to learn.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.467
And we can explore it
all together.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.603
(children cheering)

23:56.636 --> 23:59.672
Oh, I missed you too,
Magic Van.
(horn honks)

23:59.706 --> 24:01.508
Thank you, Mr. Conover.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.243
I've learned that I can
always learn more.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.614
You made me
a better television witch.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.448
Oh, what a nice hug.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.217
I wish it was live-action.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.491
Hi, kids.
We had fun today

24:18.525 --> 24:20.092
on "The Magic Van."

24:20.126 --> 24:22.461
But you know what's just
as important as learning?

24:22.495 --> 24:23.996
Safety.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.534
Remember, look both ways
before crossing the street.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.368
Always buckle your seat belt.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.937
Don't explore
ancient tombs

24:30.970 --> 24:33.706
without your parent
or guardi-- ahh!

24:33.740 --> 24:35.708
(all screaming)
