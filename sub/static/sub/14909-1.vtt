01:48.692 --> 01:49.984
Stop him!

01:53.029 --> 01:54.989
Damn it!

01:56.074 --> 01:57.283
Get her back!

01:58.326 --> 02:01.538
They're getting away!
Stop him!

02:02.580 --> 02:03.873
Go around!

02:15.510 --> 02:17.846
There they are!

02:22.475 --> 02:25.562
Stop right there!

03:34.172 --> 03:34.755
Stand back!

03:34.756 --> 03:37.591
Yoshimitsu-sama...

03:37.592 --> 03:38.592
I accept my defeat.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.304
This is my destiny.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.226
I accept my defeat.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.769
I accept my destiny.

03:48.770 --> 03:53.608
Please understand that.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.577
Hold it!

04:09.874 --> 04:11.751
Yoshimitsu-sama!

05:30.705 --> 05:34.917
Look.
There's a cave down there.

05:34.918 --> 05:39.296
Maybe it was formed
by the river stream.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.758
Hmm.

06:08.242 --> 06:12.829
Wow. Look at this.

06:12.830 --> 06:17.793
I wonder how long this cave
has been around.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.463
Hmm.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.092
Geez. It's kind of spooky.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.805
It's fine.

06:47.615 --> 06:52.615
It's cold in here.
I don't want to go any further.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.916
Then, you stay here.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.017
I'll go check a little bit deeper.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.097
<i>I first heard about it on the news.</i>

07:54.098 --> 07:55.390
<i>A few scattered reports</i>

07:55.391 --> 07:59.603
<i>of a 400-year-old body
found frozen in the ice.</i>

07:59.604 --> 08:02.689
<i>It was the kind of story
that sparks the imagination,</i>

08:02.690 --> 08:05.317
<i>gives newscasters
something to joke about,</i>

08:05.318 --> 08:07.111
<i>and then fades into oblivion.</i>

08:12.366 --> 08:15.077
<i>For me, it was a job opportunity.</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:18.956
<i>And, at first, this looked
like just another assignment...</i>

08:40.227 --> 08:43.230
Excuse me, I have an appointment
with Dr. Richards.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.191
- I'm Alan Richards.
- Hi. I'm Chris Welles.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.985
Yes, I know.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.822
Thank you.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.743
How do you do?
Let's get to work, shall we?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.501
You know what this is about?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.337
President Shogun?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.966
What else have you heard?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.469
They found this man frozen in ice,
chipped him out,

09:13.636 --> 09:16.304
and sent him to you for an autopsy.

09:16.305 --> 09:19.891
Well, it's more than that.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.686
Much more.

09:26.232 --> 09:30.068
<i>My field is Oriental History,
and they questioned me closely,</i>

09:30.069 --> 09:33.363
<i>trying to determine
the limits of my experience.</i>

09:33.364 --> 09:36.449
<i>My weak point was that
I could speak little Japanese.</i>

09:36.450 --> 09:38.494
<i>But they let that pass.</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:41.788
<i>Something more important
was on their minds.</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:44.708
<i>They weren't going to
perform an autopsy.</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:48.754
<i>They were going to bring that man
back to life.</i>

09:55.011 --> 09:58.096
- Body fluids, stable.
- Good.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.933
Dr. Richards, double-check please.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.686
Very good, Ellie.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.525
Carl, do you have a reading
on cerebral stats?

10:10.359 --> 10:12.402
35.9... 36.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.447
7.5 minutes to stabilized brain temperature

10:15.448 --> 10:18.033
before neuro-disintegration.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.660
Carl, brainwave stats.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.915
Brainwave monitor
functioning is steady at zero.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.167
Very well.
What's your body core temperature?

10:27.168 --> 10:32.168
Fahrenheit 98.4, .5, .6...

10:32.506 --> 10:33.506
We have critical.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.428
Engage thermal capacitor, now.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.563
One thing, if this goes wrong,
anybody finds out about it...

10:47.730 --> 10:48.897
I hear you.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.090
Scalpel.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.345
Let's do it.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.110
Suction.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.738
Cerebral and core, steady at 36.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.246
Cardiac stimulant, mark?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.206
90 seconds, mark.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.126
Respirator on... now.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.341
Okay, Carl, let's hook him up.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.220
Stand by for bypass.

12:15.318 --> 12:19.237
Pumping.
Ready for electro-shock.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.990
- Sixty seconds.
- Okay. Stand by.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.659
Fifty-five seconds...

12:23.826 --> 12:26.287
- Clear.
- Hit it.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.628
Nothing. What's the count?

12:35.629 --> 12:39.550
- Forty seconds.
- Clear.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.469
Go.

12:42.470 --> 12:47.470
Thirty seconds.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.644
- We're running out of time, Alan.
- I know, I know.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.521
Come on, let's do it!
Let's go! Up the volt!

12:53.522 --> 12:56.150
- Clear.
- Again.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.534
Flush him out, Ellie.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.162
Twenty.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.872
Hit it, Pete.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.208
- Ten seconds.
- Goddamn it, hit it, Pete!

13:13.209 --> 13:15.377
Wait. Listen.

13:32.728 --> 13:36.272
- We did it.
- We did it! We have brain activity!

13:36.273 --> 13:39.235
Beautiful. That's beautiful.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.728
<i>Weeks passed,</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:18.731
<i>and the samurai's condition
continued to improve.</i>

14:18.732 --> 14:22.402
<i>I went about my research
as discreetly as possible,</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:25.405
<i>for Alan had ordered
complete secrecy.</i>

14:25.406 --> 14:29.451
<i>The Institute and his career
were on the line.</i>

14:38.794 --> 14:41.754
This is something special.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.758
It suggests a real master.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.676
It looks sharp.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.304
The old katana had the sharpest,

14:49.305 --> 14:51.764
hardest, best-tempered blades
in the world.

14:51.765 --> 14:55.728
They were the soul of the samurai.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.772
The great swords...

14:58.939 --> 15:02.442
And this is a great one...

15:02.443 --> 15:05.653
Were thought to have
a life of their own.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.782
A spirit,
the embodiment of bushido.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.242
- The Way of the Warrior.
- Yes.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.496
A samurai spent his entire life
preparing for death.

15:14.497 --> 15:20.669
So at the critical moment,
he could face it without hesitation.

15:22.046 --> 15:26.175
And the autopsy?
How is it going?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.595
I'm not supposed to discuss it.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.433
I'll be in touch.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.435
I look forward to it.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.646
Thank you, Professor.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.774
Bye-bye.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.288
Hi, stranger.
What do you got for me?

15:57.289 --> 16:01.042
Not much so far,
but I did some research on the sword.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.878
These are a real find, Alan.

16:03.045 --> 16:07.174
They're made by Kunimitsu,
one of the greatest swordsmiths ever.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.886
These are the best of the best.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.720
They're worth a fortune
on the open market.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.098
Great.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.227
He was a first-rate samurai, a master.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.148
Well, I wonder
what he's going to think of us.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.605
Oh...

18:22.559 --> 18:25.645
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

18:25.646 --> 18:27.438
Stay there.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.485
Don't move!
Just stay right there!

18:32.277 --> 18:34.113
Stay right there.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.867
Dr. Richards!

18:39.868 --> 18:41.870
Dr. Richards!

18:46.792 --> 18:49.461
Fantastic.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.056
Incredible.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.443
This is truly incredible.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.753
- What's he saying?
- I can't make it out.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.853
Yoshi... something.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.024
- That must be his name.
- Yoshi.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.447
We took his swords.
We shouldn't have done that.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.743
No one's going to hurt him.
Tell him that.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.790
No one's going to hurt you.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.838
Look at him.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.050
We've got to show him
that this isn't a nightmare,

20:18.258 --> 20:21.053
that he's not crazy.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.096
- Can I get his things?
- You want to return his swords?

20:24.097 --> 20:25.640
We have to.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.558
It's his only link
to the world he knows.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.601
So?

20:28.602 --> 20:31.103
So, if we don't,
he'll think he's a prisoner.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.900
A samurai would prefer death.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.002
Be ready for anything.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.453
Let's leave him for now.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.243
Hi.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.164
<i>Day after day,</i>

22:55.165 --> 22:58.042
<i>I surrounded him
with things from his past.</i>

22:58.043 --> 23:00.628
<i>And day after day, I studied him,</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:05.549
<i>hoping for a sign of trust,
of recognition...</i>

23:05.550 --> 23:07.260
<i>of anything.</i>

23:19.606 --> 23:22.234
Go on.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.826
Sake.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.733
Sake.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.237
Those swords, what are they worth?

24:09.656 --> 24:12.117
No, really, how much?

24:13.118 --> 24:16.038
More than most people
make in a lifetime.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.209
How's the patient?

24:27.382 --> 24:29.384
Why does he do that?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.594
Maybe he doesn't like you.

24:31.595 --> 24:35.097
No, I'm serious.
I'm worried about brain damage.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.684
He doesn't respond very well.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.296
Now, you.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.654
No, it doesn't work like that.

26:41.349 --> 26:44.811
Okay, Charlie, I want the swords!

27:37.948 --> 27:40.158
Jonathan...

27:40.867 --> 27:42.827
<i>Jonathan Martin...</i>

27:56.841 --> 27:59.886
<i>No one dresses
a woman like Jonathan Martin.</i>

28:22.075 --> 28:24.577
<i> I'm a sinner a'</i>

28:24.744 --> 28:27.079
<i> I kiss the breast r</i>

28:27.080 --> 28:29.499
<i> I am the sadist I'</i>

28:29.666 --> 28:31.626
<i> I whip the flesh r</i>

28:31.793 --> 28:34.420
<i> I'll rape the women a'</i>

28:34.421 --> 28:37.047
<i> Take those who enter I'</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:39.383
<i> You'll be molested a'</i>

28:39.384 --> 28:42.011
<i> I'm Tormentor a'</i>

28:42.012 --> 28:44.179
<i> Tormentor a'</i>

28:44.180 --> 28:46.640
<i> Tormented a'</i>

28:46.641 --> 28:49.184
<i> Tormentor a'</i>

28:49.185 --> 28:51.979
<i> Tormented a'</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:54.356
<i> Tormentor a'</i>

28:54.357 --> 28:56.942
<i> Tormented a'</i>

28:56.943 --> 28:59.445
<i> Tormentor a'</i>

28:59.446 --> 29:03.658
<i> Tormented a'</i>

29:03.825 --> 29:09.789
<i> I am the Lord of Liars a'</i>

29:12.876 --> 29:17.876
<i> And I command the Sword of Fire I'</i>

29:18.340 --> 29:21.051
<i> Fire I</i>

29:27.223 --> 29:28.850
<i>Tom?</i>

29:44.199 --> 29:46.326
Tom, is that you...?

29:48.453 --> 29:50.330
Very funny.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.792
Tom?

30:28.118 --> 30:30.537
- Where is he?
- There.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.252
I didn't even hear anything.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.379
I didn't know,
I just found him here.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.215
Oh, my God.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.137
Goddamn it!

30:48.513 --> 30:51.766
This is going to ruin everything.
Everything.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.739
Get off the road!

32:52.804 --> 32:55.514
Listen, folks.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.183
I'm not buying any of this.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.562
I got a body there
with a 27-inch gash up his middle.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.774
That's a terminal mishap
of major proportions.

33:06.609 --> 33:10.238
And you tell me
it's just a simple robbery.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.828
Okay, we're all going downtown
to get this straightened out.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.707
Brody! Now!

33:21.541 --> 33:23.251
Load 'em up.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.875
Over here!

34:56.844 --> 34:58.595
Come on! Over here, old man!

34:58.596 --> 35:00.263
It's payday, uncle!

35:00.264 --> 35:02.474
You know the rules! Pay up!
You know what's happening here!

35:02.475 --> 35:04.977
Come on, old man.
Give us the money.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.814
- Come on, baby!
- Give us the money!

35:10.900 --> 35:14.528
What's the matter, old man?
You think I'm kidding?

35:14.529 --> 35:18.031
Johnny! Johnny!

35:18.032 --> 35:20.325
You damaged the merchandise,
old man.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.618
Now, that was stupid!

35:21.619 --> 35:23.787
You should know better
than to cut Johnny Tooth!

35:23.788 --> 35:25.539
We usually go good with old folks!

35:25.540 --> 35:28.208
"Revenge is sweet," sayeth the Lord.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.043
Now, I'm going to
have to hurt you, old man.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.255
Kill him, Johnny!
Where do you want to start with him?

35:33.256 --> 35:35.341
Wait a minute.
What the hell is that?

35:36.926 --> 35:40.971
Hey, hey! Kung fu!
Come on, baby!

35:40.972 --> 35:43.015
Kung fu! Kung fu!

35:43.182 --> 35:45.351
Hey, freak,
where'd you get the pajamas?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.153
Come on, baby!

35:57.071 --> 35:59.365
You better get out of here!

36:00.658 --> 36:04.328
- Go get him, Johnny.
- Come on over here, sucker!

36:07.665 --> 36:09.332
Get him, yeah!

37:01.594 --> 37:04.387
Girl, they got you and the john?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.807
Honey, ain't life a bitch?

37:06.808 --> 37:08.683
How long are you going to
keep us here?

37:08.684 --> 37:11.646
- Till you tell me the truth.
- I told you the truth.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.358
Hey, Harry, get a load of this.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.984
Some nut dressed like a samurai

37:17.985 --> 37:21.155
just chopped up three guys
on South and Third.

37:29.831 --> 37:33.375
You know, I ain't
never seen nothing like that

37:33.376 --> 37:36.378
in all my days as a military man,

37:36.379 --> 37:38.297
and I've seen plenty!

37:38.798 --> 37:42.176
You're a military man, too.

37:42.343 --> 37:45.721
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on you.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.982
Name's Walsh.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.026
Master Sergeant
William George Washington Walsh.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.697
United States Army, Retired.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.036
Oh, I served in the Pacific, too.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.206
No hard feelings.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.675
I spent 30 years in the Army.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.178
Been everywhere, seen everything.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.846
And what do I get?

38:27.847 --> 38:32.142
750 dollars
the first Tuesday of each month.

38:32.143 --> 38:37.231
And a bunch or rotten no-good
dope fiends try to rip that off.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.483
Gets you mad, you know?

38:41.360 --> 38:44.112
Hey, I got an idea!

38:44.113 --> 38:45.781
Come on.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.450
Come on.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.187
We have to find Yoshi.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.022
Forget it.
Let the police handle it.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.232
We've got to find him.
He can't survive out there.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.902
I hope to hell that he doesn't.

39:24.403 --> 39:26.447
You really mean that.

39:27.657 --> 39:30.201
Jesus!

39:42.296 --> 39:45.257
There's a friend of mine in here
I want you to meet.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.593
Come on in.

39:51.180 --> 39:54.099
Hey, Willie-san!

39:54.100 --> 39:55.851
Hello, sir!

39:57.770 --> 40:00.730
- Where'd you pick up the samurai?
- It's a long story.

40:00.731 --> 40:01.856
I'll tell you this much,

40:01.857 --> 40:04.568
if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here.

40:06.445 --> 40:10.365
He just saved my life. Right?

40:10.366 --> 40:11.826
Right.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.912
<i>Friend. Friend.</i>

40:15.913 --> 40:19.333
Is that who I think it is?

40:20.042 --> 40:23.545
Toshiro Mifune!

40:23.546 --> 40:26.799
I told you this place was hot.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.261
You try talking to him.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.222
I don't think he speaks any English.

41:08.841 --> 41:13.303
- What's he saying?
- Some weird dialect, man.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.767
I only got about every other word.
But I'll tell you this...

41:19.351 --> 41:21.771
He's a wacko.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.820
<i>I knew Yoshi had to be stopped.</i>

41:30.821 --> 41:33.031
<i>But how?</i>

41:33.032 --> 41:35.867
<i>The police would do it
any way they could.</i>

41:35.868 --> 41:37.368
<i>And Alan...</i>

41:37.369 --> 41:40.539
<i>There was no telling what he'd do.</i>

41:56.597 --> 41:58.307
Biru!

42:33.676 --> 42:36.511
<i>Yoshimitsu-sama...</i>

42:36.512 --> 42:38.889
Yoshimitsu-sama.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.227
Come on! Get back!

43:28.230 --> 43:30.356
Banzai, you in there?

43:30.357 --> 43:31.983
You hear me?

43:31.984 --> 43:36.029
Come out, Banzai!
I got a surprise for you!

43:36.030 --> 43:37.489
- We got trouble!
- Hey, Nip!

43:37.656 --> 43:38.656
Big trouble.

43:38.657 --> 43:40.491
Eat up, man, it's your last one!

43:40.492 --> 43:42.494
Finish it good, man!

43:45.748 --> 43:49.709
- Come on out!
- You in there, Banzai?

43:49.710 --> 43:52.630
Hey, friend, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

43:52.922 --> 43:56.257
Hey, Nip! I want you!

43:56.258 --> 43:59.135
- Banzai! Come out!
- Yeah, man!

43:59.136 --> 44:01.596
- Come on!
- Let's see you do some chicken shit!

44:01.597 --> 44:02.723
Banzai!

44:13.776 --> 44:15.235
It's a trap, friend!

44:15.236 --> 44:17.195
Let's cross this outta here!

44:17.196 --> 44:19.823
Come on, Banzai!

44:26.872 --> 44:29.540
- Is he coming?
- Yeah, he's coming.

44:29.541 --> 44:33.587
And we're going to blow
his yellow brains out.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.764
Damn fool.

44:52.106 --> 44:56.110
Hey, Slant Eyes!

45:05.744 --> 45:07.621
Hey, Nip!

45:10.124 --> 45:12.876
Come and get me!

45:19.008 --> 45:21.593
Over here!

45:31.645 --> 45:35.774
Hey, Banzai, over here!

45:40.279 --> 45:42.655
No, not there!

45:42.656 --> 45:45.284
Over here!

45:47.828 --> 45:51.373
You shouldn't have clone
what you done to my friends.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.836
Now you're going to pay!

46:40.839 --> 46:44.426
- Hey, Johnny!
- Yo!

46:45.511 --> 46:47.930
They got Fist, man!

46:49.098 --> 46:50.974
Get that bastard!

46:52.226 --> 46:54.228
Yeah, right.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.362
Bandito!

47:49.116 --> 47:51.076
Fist!

47:52.244 --> 47:54.203
Your pals are finished!

47:58.167 --> 48:00.502
Hey, old man!

48:01.962 --> 48:04.381
Old man, I quit!

48:31.742 --> 48:35.621
You gotta be kidding me.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.836
<i>Sayonara, </i> sucker.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.384
No!

49:02.272 --> 49:04.315
Hey! You're not going in there?

49:04.316 --> 49:05.609
You're crazy.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.964
Yoshimitsu-san!

49:42.020 --> 49:44.439
Yoshimitsu-san!

50:14.386 --> 50:15.803
What happened?

50:15.804 --> 50:18.222
Forget what happened.

50:18.223 --> 50:20.850
- Are you his friend?
- Yes.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.893
Get him the hell outta here, then.

50:22.894 --> 50:24.979
- But you need help.
- But nothing...

50:24.980 --> 50:27.481
The cops are going to be here
any minute.

50:27.482 --> 50:31.361
What's going to happen
when they try to put the cuffs on him?

50:36.742 --> 50:38.660
You're right.

50:40.996 --> 50:44.333
Come on. Please.

50:48.795 --> 50:51.423
Go! Go!

50:52.591 --> 50:55.676
No. Yoshimitsu-san...

50:55.677 --> 50:59.221
Your friend...

50:59.222 --> 51:02.308
Your friend will be all right.

51:05.395 --> 51:09.274
Go. Go.

51:50.232 --> 51:52.109
Come on.

52:04.996 --> 52:10.043
Alan, that Detective Berger
was on the phone.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.795
Yoshi destroyed
a restaurant downtown.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.631
He's killed three more people.

52:15.632 --> 52:16.842
Oh, God.

52:18.009 --> 52:20.302
But Berger said
that the samurai left

52:20.303 --> 52:22.722
with a woman who matches
Chris's description.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.015
I don't believe it.
Have they found her yet?

52:25.016 --> 52:28.270
No, but they're watching
her apartment.

52:29.104 --> 52:31.272
She's too smart to go there.

52:31.273 --> 52:33.941
We have to find her first.
We've gotta put an end to this thing.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.653
How can we? The police
don't even know where to look.

52:38.113 --> 52:39.614
I know where to look.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.460
That man cannot exist.

53:34.461 --> 53:38.547
He is a ghost, a phantom.

53:38.548 --> 53:41.050
Or a hoax.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.761
He's real, Professor.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.805
And he needs our help.

53:45.806 --> 53:49.058
It is not that simple, Chris.

53:49.059 --> 53:51.769
He is samurai...

53:51.770 --> 53:54.146
Yoshi, as you call him,

53:54.147 --> 53:57.608
<i>was a great warrior in his world.</i>

53:57.609 --> 53:59.777
<i>He tried to seclude himself</i>

53:59.778 --> 54:03.073
<i>from the endless wars
that plagued his homeland.</i>

54:04.366 --> 54:07.952
<i>He found a young wife, Chidori,</i>

54:07.953 --> 54:10.288
<i>and grew to love her very much.</i>

54:11.581 --> 54:13.499
<i>The last thing he remembers,</i>

54:13.500 --> 54:16.836
<i>Chidori was kidnapped by a rival clan</i>

54:16.837 --> 54:20.714
<i>and killed before his eyes.</i>

54:20.715 --> 54:25.715
<i>He is still very confused
about what happened and where he is.</i>

54:30.392 --> 54:32.142
But we can help him.

54:32.143 --> 54:34.687
He can have a new life.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.773
As I said, he is samurai.

54:37.774 --> 54:41.403
That decision must be his.

54:56.585 --> 54:58.920
I will be back soon.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.966
Thank you.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.554
Bye.

55:13.810 --> 55:17.980
<i>Yoshi's world and mine
differed in almost every way.</i>

55:17.981 --> 55:19.481
<i>To watch him learn</i>

55:19.482 --> 55:24.029
<i>is to rediscover miracles
in the everyday things around us.</i>

55:30.744 --> 55:33.914
Lamp

55:36.833 --> 55:38.376
Light.

56:00.774 --> 56:02.859
Yoshi-san...

57:06.506 --> 57:07.841
Yoshimitsu-sama...

57:09.676 --> 57:11.636
Chidori...

57:56.723 --> 57:58.725
Professor?

57:59.684 --> 58:01.894
Hello, Chris.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.897
- I won't let you take him.
- You don't have much to say about it.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.816
- I'll call Detective Berger.
- Well, that's a great idea.

58:07.817 --> 58:09.778
What happens
when the SWAT team arrives?

58:11.029 --> 58:13.323
Yoshi-san.

58:23.166 --> 58:25.084
Alan, what's happening?

58:29.464 --> 58:30.757
No!

58:36.763 --> 58:41.768
- You killed him!
- He's just stunned. For now.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.233
- Come on, move it.
- Hey, don't!

58:49.234 --> 58:51.193
Out of the way. Inside.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.070
Wait! What are you doing?

58:53.071 --> 58:54.696
Get in!

58:54.697 --> 58:56.825
Alan, for God's sake...!

58:58.868 --> 59:00.245
Hey!

59:19.514 --> 59:22.474
Damn it, Alan.
Tell me what you're doing.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.310
I'm going to do
what I was contracted to do.

59:27.272 --> 59:28.982
I'm going to do an autopsy.

59:30.608 --> 59:33.360
God... That's murder.

59:33.361 --> 59:34.903
Nonsense.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.780
He's been dead for over 400 years.

59:36.781 --> 59:38.157
Don't give me that crap.

59:38.158 --> 59:40.492
I can prove that Yoshi was dead
when I got him.

59:40.493 --> 59:43.370
If he's still dead when the police
find him, they'll have no case.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.080
Yoshi will have the perfect alibi.

59:45.081 --> 59:47.291
But you're not to blame.
Nobody's to blame.

59:47.292 --> 59:50.086
- We didn't do anything!
- Do you think they'll believe that?

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.436
Nobody answers the phone
around here?

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.522
Take your hands off me.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.356
Homicide. Carlyle.

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:13.567
Hello.
Detective Berger, please.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:16.278
Berger's not here.
Can I take a message?

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:19.031
<i>The samurai and Chris
have been kidnapped,</i>

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.741
taken to the Institute.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:23.160
Samu-what's been taken where?

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:28.161
<i>Samurai. The samurai. Hurry!</i>

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.418
Yeah, right.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.801
Prep a vein.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.012
What are you doing?

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.056
What's in that needle?

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:46.808
Just air. Great stuff.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:50.270
Very inexpensive
and impossible to trace.

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:53.274
- Pete!
- Hey, Chris, it's the only way.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.449
There's no need for that.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:06.370
- No! No!
- Chris, please!

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.497
- Give me a hand here.
- Chris, please!

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.708
Now! Pete, goddamn it,
give me a hand.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.338
Go on, do it now.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.341
What the hell's going on back there?

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:24.012
Stop him, Pete, for God's sake!

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.847
Stop him! Oh!

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.351
- Jesus Christ! Pete!
- Alan, wait!

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.062
Damn it! Pete...
Pete, give me a hand!

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.939
Stop the van, Carl!
Stop the van!

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.983
- Hey!
- Stop the van! Stop the van!

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.152
- Drive, Carl!
- Just drive!

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.880
God!

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.802
God!

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:27.659
- No!
- No!

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:33.291
- Oh, God! Oh, Jesus!
- No!

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.209
Yoshimitsu-san, no!

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:45.386
Thank God.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.271
Hey, Berger.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.903
- When did you get this?
- Five, ten minutes ago.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:06.657
- It's important?
- Yeah... Brody!

01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.118
Don't rush off.

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:35.644
Hey!

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:38.231
Hey, hold it! Hold it!

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:42.193
What the hell happened to you?

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:55.247
<i>Yoshi seemed guided by instinct...</i>

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:58.458
<i>Instinct and years of training.</i>

01:03:58.459 --> 01:04:02.964
<i>Whatever his secret,
he knew exactly what he was doing.</i>

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.778
We think they went that way.
You guys be careful. They're armed.

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.406
- Armed with what?
- Samurai swords.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.453
- Say again?
- You heard me.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.707
Load him up.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.584
<i>Three-Papa-Six.</i>

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.796
<i>We have a report the suspect is
headed toward the lake. Do you copy?</i>

01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:29.216
This is Berger, I copy. Out.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:32.177
- That's it, that's all I know.
- Well, it's a start.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.804
<i>Three-Papa-Six, this is Volcker.</i>

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:35.347
<i>We have a confirmed sighting.</i>

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.641
<i>Suspect and victim are
just below Baker's Rock.</i>

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:40.060
<i>He's definitely headed
toward the lake. Over.</i>

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.856
- Are you finished with me?
- Yeah. You wanna ride?

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:46.441
No, they brought my car down
from the Institute.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:49.320
Joe! Get over here!

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:20.851
Air-12, this is Ground Control.
Please confirm destination, over.

01:06:21.018 --> 01:06:23.728
Roger that, Ground Control.
This is Air-12.

01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:26.482
We are en route to link up
with the Volcker Unit. Over.

01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:22.287
<i>This is the police.
I repeat, this is the police.</i>

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.289
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.834
<i>Freeze, right where you are!</i>

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.920
Yoshimitsu-san!

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:33.715
Watch him,
he's making a break for it.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.594
Okay, cowboy.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:42.933
- It's okay! You're going to be okay!
- No, I'm all right!

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.187
Let me go! Let me go!

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:59.408
- I see him. Coming around the curve.
- Yeah. Yeah, there he is.

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:02.911
I got him.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.871
Stay on him.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:06.874
- Stay on him.
- I got him.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:23.015
We got it.
Going to be a quick Code 4.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.434
Damn. I lost him.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.437
- What?
- I lost him.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.626
He's behind us. Turn back.

01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:20.404
Volcker, this is Air-12.
We've lost contact with the suspect.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.700
Come back, Air-12.
Please repeat transmission.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:27.037
<i>We've lost contact with the suspect.</i>

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:32.417
<i>We think he's doubled back
toward your position.</i>

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.711
Negatory, Air-12,
we haven't seen a thing.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:37.005
Keep looking.
He's gotta be just up ahead of you.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.090
Roger.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:42.385
I'm taking the girl over to Berger.
Keep me posted.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:45.513
- You lost him?
- Nah, they'll get him.

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:48.600
We'll have this wrapped up
before dawn.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:51.996
Hey!

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.554
There! Get him!

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:09.723
Hey!

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.559
Watch it!

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.187
I got him! I got him!

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:16.896
You'll hit the girl.

01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:19.858
Suspect headed up to Fire Road!
He's got the girl!

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.150
<i>Get me a car up here, right away!</i>

01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:22.736
Damn it.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:27.074
This is Berger, I'm going to take
the Ridge Road up to the lake.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.460
Volcker, move it!

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:05.028
This is Air-12.
We are on route to intercept suspect.

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.196
Roger, Air-12.

01:12:06.363 --> 01:12:09.825
<i>It looks like they're headed
toward the cliff.</i>

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.544
No! No!

01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:23.714
Yoshi, stop! Go back!

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.429
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
Get away from him.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.226
Don't be stupid, Chris.
Get away from him!

01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:41.064
- Get out of the way, Chris!
- Alan!

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:44.609
- Get the hell out of the way!
- It won't do any good, now!

01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:15.890
Oh, for God's sake,
Yoshi, don't do it!

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.426
Yoshi-san!

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.146
Yoshi!

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.703
Please! Don't shoot!

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.581
Hold your fire!

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:27.671
Yoshi-san! Please...

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:57.427
What was it he said to you?

01:15:57.594 --> 01:15:59.930
Right there, before the end.

01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:12.276
He said,
"There are no second chances.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:25.080
The way of the samurai is death."

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.295
Yeah.
