00:00.767 --> 00:02.169
<b>- Previously on "All Stars"...</b>

00:02.236 --> 00:05.506
<b>You'll be auditioning</b>
<b>to be part of the Kitty Girls.</b>

00:05.572 --> 00:07.741
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

00:07.808 --> 00:13.313
<b>I've decided to audition</b>
<b>a few other girls.</b>

00:13.380 --> 00:15.115
<b>[cheering]</b>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.484
<b>- Hey, yo, sis, I'm back!</b>

00:17.551 --> 00:21.321
<b>- In the end,</b>
<b>one of the top five All Stars</b>

00:21.388 --> 00:22.856
<b>will get the chop</b>

00:22.923 --> 00:28.962
<b>and be replaced by</b>
<b>one of the eliminated queens.</b>

00:29.029 --> 00:32.766
<b>My top five All Stars,</b>

00:32.833 --> 00:34.334
<b>con-drag-ulations,</b>
<b>you're the winning team.</b>

00:34.401 --> 00:37.271
<b>[cheers and applause]</b>

00:37.337 --> 00:40.073
<b>BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>you're a winner, baby.</b>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.743
<b>[applause]</b>

00:44.011 --> 00:47.247
<b>Which queen have you chosen</b>

00:47.314 --> 00:50.117
<b>to bring back</b>
<b>to the competition?</b>

00:50.184 --> 00:52.352
<b>- There's one queen</b>

00:52.419 --> 00:54.488
<b>who didn't have</b>
<b>as much of an opportunity...</b>

00:57.024 --> 00:58.859
<b>So Morgan.</b>

00:58.926 --> 01:02.563
<b>- Con-drag-ulations, Morgan.</b>
<b>You are back in the game.</b>

01:04.064 --> 01:07.067
<b>Which of your All Star teammates</b>

01:07.100 --> 01:09.703
<b>have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

01:09.770 --> 01:12.406
<b>- This is the easiest choice</b>

01:12.472 --> 01:14.942
<b>that I have had to make</b>
<b>this entire season.</b>

01:19.246 --> 01:20.380
<b>I'm going home.</b>

01:22.282 --> 01:23.450
<b>- What?</b>

01:25.552 --> 01:28.188
<b>- I wanted this opportunity</b>
<b>to come back,</b>

01:28.255 --> 01:32.860
<b>to fight hard to show myself</b>
<b>what I can do.</b>

01:32.926 --> 01:34.261
<b>I've accomplished that.</b>

01:34.328 --> 01:36.964
<b>I feel like</b>
<b>I'm going home winning.</b>

01:37.097 --> 01:40.534
<b>- DeLa, sashay away.</b>

01:50.776 --> 01:53.779
<b>- The whole room</b>
<b>is actually shaken.</b>

01:53.846 --> 01:57.283
<b>BenDeLaCreme just left</b>
<b>the Spice Girls Geri style.</b>

01:57.350 --> 01:59.218
<b>The person who's won</b>
<b>the most challenges,</b>

01:59.285 --> 02:00.987
<b>who nobody would send home,</b>

02:01.053 --> 02:03.789
<b>left "Drag Race"</b>
<b>on her own accord.</b>

02:03.856 --> 02:05.291
<b>I'm gagged.</b>

02:05.358 --> 02:07.727
<b>- I was not expecting that.</b>

02:07.793 --> 02:09.195
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- At all.</b>

02:09.261 --> 02:12.465
<b>I wasn't even expecting</b>
<b>my name to be called.</b>

02:12.531 --> 02:14.900
<b>I'm happy that DeLa</b>
<b>chose me to come back,</b>

02:14.967 --> 02:16.435
<b>but did DeLa pick me</b>

02:16.502 --> 02:19.105
<b>because she sent me home first</b>
<b>and felt guilty about it?</b>

02:19.171 --> 02:22.575
<b>And why the [bleep] would she</b>
<b>leave a competition like this?</b>

02:22.642 --> 02:24.877
<b>Did she waste someone's time?</b>

02:24.944 --> 02:27.747
<b>Girl, everybody else</b>
<b>is here for the crown.</b>

02:27.813 --> 02:29.348
<b>We want to win.</b>

02:29.415 --> 02:31.717
<b>- Having had</b>
<b>conversations with her,</b>

02:31.784 --> 02:35.554
<b>I feel like the process</b>
<b>was getting too much for her.</b>

02:35.621 --> 02:39.692
<b>- Also, she hated</b>
<b>having to draw lipsticks.</b>

02:39.759 --> 02:41.861
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- It's a lot of ways</b>

02:41.927 --> 02:44.597
<b>that you could look at it</b>
<b>as to why he did what he did.</b>

02:44.664 --> 02:48.801
<b>He could've did it because</b>
<b>he was just tired of it.</b>

02:48.868 --> 02:52.538
<b>He could've did it to keep</b>
<b>his name as Miss Congeniality.</b>

02:52.605 --> 02:55.174
<b>It could've been</b>
<b>a promotional move for her,</b>

02:55.241 --> 02:57.910
<b>but Ru like people</b>
<b>that's gonna fight.</b>

02:57.977 --> 03:00.913
<b>Ru like people</b>
<b>that's interested in winning,</b>

03:00.980 --> 03:03.516
<b>competing, staying in the race,</b>

03:03.582 --> 03:06.285
<b>being fierce,</b>
<b>and not playing the radio.</b>

03:06.352 --> 03:08.721
<b>If you wanna leave, leave.</b>

03:08.788 --> 03:10.556
<b>- I just...</b>

03:10.623 --> 03:14.493
<b>I just wish that</b>
<b>she could've fought, you know?</b>

03:15.861 --> 03:17.863
<b>- Even in her final moments,</b>
<b>honey,</b>

03:17.930 --> 03:20.433
<b>DeLa was still using</b>
<b>her little strategy.</b>

03:20.499 --> 03:23.703
<b>You don't only throw</b>
<b>yourself to slaughter,</b>

03:23.769 --> 03:26.372
<b>you save the lion</b>

03:26.439 --> 03:29.475
<b>that was gonna eat you</b>
<b>for lunch yesterday.</b>

03:29.542 --> 03:30.876
<b>She said, oh, I may be going,</b>

03:30.943 --> 03:32.845
<b>but y'all will remember me</b>
<b>as Miss Congeniality.</b>

03:32.912 --> 03:35.014
<b>- The show much go on, girls.</b>

03:35.081 --> 03:37.717
<b>- We've lost</b>
<b>our clear frontrunner,</b>

03:37.783 --> 03:39.952
<b>so now the rest of us</b>
<b>are like, oh, my gosh,</b>

03:40.019 --> 03:42.722
<b>the likelihood of me winning</b>
<b>has just skyrocketed.</b>

03:42.788 --> 03:45.358
<b>This is like your pretty friends</b>
<b>not going to prom,</b>

03:45.424 --> 03:49.829
<b>and now you're, like,</b>
<b>don't forget to write.</b>

03:49.895 --> 03:53.366
<b>I'm gonna write you a letter</b>
<b>on one of my $100,000.</b>

03:53.432 --> 03:55.434
<b>- Morgan, I got to come back</b>
<b>on "Drag Race,"</b>

03:55.501 --> 03:57.470
<b>and I know it's a super gag.</b>

03:57.536 --> 03:59.372
<b>- It is, and I feel like</b>

03:59.438 --> 04:00.773
<b>I'm the luckiest bitch</b>
<b>in the fold.</b>

04:00.840 --> 04:03.276
<b>I'm happy as [bleep]</b>
<b>that I'm here,</b>

04:03.342 --> 04:04.744
<b>but I missed</b>
<b>a lot of challenges,</b>

04:04.810 --> 04:07.179
<b>and I'm going to have</b>
<b>to work my ass off</b>

04:07.246 --> 04:10.016
<b>to prove that</b>
<b>I deserve to be here.</b>

04:10.082 --> 04:12.318
<b>- BeBe, whose lipstick</b>
<b>did you pull?</b>

04:12.385 --> 04:15.788
<b>- Out of respect for DeLa,</b>

04:15.855 --> 04:18.891
<b>I'm not going to reveal</b>
<b>who I was going to send home</b>

04:18.958 --> 04:23.195
<b>or I was gonna bring in,</b>
<b>just so everybody knows.</b>

04:23.229 --> 04:24.397
<b>So don't come asking me.</b>

04:24.463 --> 04:26.065
<b>- We do this every week, girl.</b>

04:26.198 --> 04:27.700
<b>You don't want to say?</b>

04:27.767 --> 04:29.435
<b>Girl, what the [bleep].</b>

04:29.502 --> 04:31.203
<b>We've all had to show</b>
<b>a lipstick.</b>

04:31.237 --> 04:34.106
<b>- And I would just</b>
<b>really, really appreciate</b>

04:34.206 --> 04:37.109
<b>if everybody just lets that be.</b>

04:37.209 --> 04:40.413
<b>I'm not scared, but</b>
<b>at this point we need peace.</b>

04:40.479 --> 04:42.214
<b>We need people to be focused</b>

04:42.248 --> 04:44.350
<b>because it's now</b>
<b>a journey to the top.</b>

04:44.417 --> 04:47.286
<b>So if anybody</b>
<b>is curious about anything,</b>

04:47.353 --> 04:49.689
<b>just know you'll be curious</b>
<b>for the rest of your life.</b>

04:50.823 --> 04:52.558
<b>- She's not gonna tell.</b>

04:52.625 --> 04:53.826
<b>- Let's not talk about it then,</b>
<b>thank you.</b>

04:53.893 --> 04:55.361
<b>- Let's get out of drag, bitch.</b>

04:55.428 --> 04:57.063
<b>- Yes, let's get out of drag.</b>

04:57.163 --> 04:59.065
<b>Oh, baby, Miss BeBe,</b>

04:59.165 --> 05:01.167
<b>she don't want to piss off</b>
<b>whoever the girl is</b>

05:01.200 --> 05:04.670
<b>whose lipstick is sitting up</b>
<b>in her bra tittie, okay?</b>

05:04.737 --> 05:06.772
<b>She said, I ain't pulling</b>
<b>the lipstick from the bra tittie</b>

05:06.839 --> 05:10.176
<b>because I will still need</b>
<b>allies in this game. Oh.</b>

05:10.176 --> 05:11.577
<b>So that Cersei Lannister.</b>

05:11.644 --> 05:14.614
<b>I see now,</b>
<b>but here come the dragons.</b>

05:16.816 --> 05:19.685
<b>I'm Daenerys, bitch.</b>

<b>- Nancy Pelosi?</b>
<b>I'm dying.</b>

<b>- Well, when I got</b>
<b>the invitation</b>

06:36.495 --> 06:40.766
<b>to visit the workroom,</b>
<b>I couldn't resist.</b>

06:40.833 --> 06:42.201
<b>- Wait, did somebody</b>
<b>just say "resist?"</b>

06:42.201 --> 06:43.836

<b>It's about taking pride,</b>

06:57.016 --> 07:00.453
<b>take pride in yourselves,</b>
<b>so you know your power.</b>

07:00.519 --> 07:02.888
<b>- And don't forget to vote.</b>

07:02.955 --> 07:04.523
<b>- Voting is everything.</b>

07:04.590 --> 07:07.326
<b>I mean, people sacrificed</b>
<b>so much in our country</b>

07:07.393 --> 07:10.463
<b>for people to have</b>
<b>the right to vote.</b>

07:10.529 --> 07:12.698
<b>It's a blessing,</b>
<b>but we have to use it.</b>

<b>If you don't vote,</b>
<b>you don't count, and you count.</b>

<b>you're making</b>

<b>but before you go,</b>

<b>- Bye, Nancy.</b>
<b>- We love you!</b>

07:45.131 --> 07:48.401
<b>- Bye-ee!</b>
<b>[laughs]</b>

07:48.467 --> 07:51.704
<b>Well, speaking of strong women,</b>

07:51.771 --> 07:57.944
<b>I love me a serious Meryl Streep</b>
<b>Oscar-winning drama.</b>

07:58.010 --> 08:01.213
<b>And I also love me</b>
<b>a filthy Amy Shumer comedy,</b>

08:01.280 --> 08:02.448
<b>which got me thinking.</b>

08:02.515 --> 08:05.651
<b>What would happen</b>
<b>if they made a movie</b>

08:05.718 --> 08:08.387

<b>The working title is...</b>

<b>Rolls off the tongue.</b>

08:32.912 --> 08:35.247
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- Okay. Hey.</b>

08:35.314 --> 08:36.916
<b>- Now, our story features</b>

08:36.983 --> 08:39.885
<b>the most gag-worthy ensemble</b>

08:39.952 --> 08:42.054
<b>There's Sharon Frockovich,</b>

<b>She's reigned for decades</b>

08:51.030 --> 08:55.401
<b>with the motto, "Keep calm</b>

08:55.468 --> 08:56.535
<b>- [laughs]</b>

08:56.602 --> 08:58.738
<b>- There's Actavia,</b>

08:58.804 --> 09:02.775
<b>the pie-making maid</b>
<b>turned rocket scientist</b>

09:02.842 --> 09:06.178
<b>who doesn't take crap</b>

09:06.245 --> 09:09.148
<b>And there's the Beige Swan,</b>

<b>an unhinged prima ballerina</b>
<b>obsessed with winning.</b>

09:14.887 --> 09:17.490
<b>And last but not least,</b>

<b>a young actress</b>

09:19.225 --> 09:22.028
<b>singing and dancing her way</b>

<b>Now, Morgan,</b>

09:27.500 --> 09:28.768

09:48.955 --> 09:50.623
<b>- Morgan, it doesn't mean</b>
<b>you're the boss.</b>

09:50.690 --> 09:52.291
<b>Don't get too cocky now.</b>

09:52.358 --> 09:55.261
<b>- Ooh, yes, bitch,</b>
<b>I'm feeling very fair,</b>

09:55.328 --> 09:56.729
<b>but, you know,</b>
<b>a little powerful.</b>

09:56.796 --> 09:58.431
<b>I'm just gonna assign the roles</b>

09:58.497 --> 10:01.233
<b>to who I think is gonna</b>
<b>be good in that role.</b>

10:01.300 --> 10:03.302
<b>- I can already see</b>
<b>by the description,</b>

10:03.369 --> 10:05.037
<b>I'd love to have Actavia.</b>

10:05.137 --> 10:06.005
<b>- I'm gonna</b>
<b>read through it first.</b>

10:06.138 --> 10:07.406
<b>- Okay, sorry.</b>

10:07.473 --> 10:11.143
<b>Look, doing well in this</b>
<b>challenge is very important.</b>

10:11.143 --> 10:14.213
<b>Whoever comes out on top on this</b>
<b>goes on to the top four,</b>

10:14.280 --> 10:16.382
<b>so I'm very vocal</b>
<b>about saying, Miss Morgan,</b>

10:16.449 --> 10:17.717
<b>I'm gonna need a heavy role.</b>

10:19.151 --> 10:20.620
<b>I would love to have Actavia,</b>

10:20.686 --> 10:22.321
<b>but I'd be fine with Sharon,</b>

10:22.388 --> 10:25.558
<b>because Sharon</b>
<b>looks like a lot of dialogue</b>

10:25.625 --> 10:28.527
<b>and I'm good at memorizing a lot</b>
<b>in a very short amount of time.</b>

10:28.594 --> 10:30.696
<b>- I think I want LaLa</b>
<b>or Beige Swan,</b>

10:30.763 --> 10:31.731
<b>but I really like LaLa.</b>

10:31.797 --> 10:32.999
<b>- Kennedy?</b>

10:33.065 --> 10:35.901
<b>- I was actually looking</b>
<b>at Beige Swan and LaLa.</b>

10:35.968 --> 10:37.770
<b>- I would love to try LaLa.</b>

10:37.837 --> 10:39.038
<b>I went to school</b>
<b>for musical theater,</b>

10:39.171 --> 10:40.539
<b>and I feel like</b>
<b>I know this girl.</b>

10:40.606 --> 10:43.509
<b>- How about BeBe</b>
<b>doing the Queen?</b>

10:43.576 --> 10:45.511
<b>- Seems fitting.</b>

10:45.578 --> 10:48.114
<b>- I wonder why</b>
<b>I'm being given the Queen.</b>

10:48.114 --> 10:50.583
<b>She's very uppity tight,</b>

10:50.650 --> 10:55.621
<b>very stiff and kind of</b>
<b>very unapproachable.</b>

10:55.688 --> 10:58.157
<b>I don't get it.</b>

10:58.224 --> 11:01.894
<b>- I like Beige Swan just 'cause</b>
<b>I'm, you know, mental anyway.</b>

11:01.961 --> 11:03.396
<b>- [laughs]</b>

11:03.462 --> 11:05.998
<b>- You could do Actavia.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

11:06.132 --> 11:08.200
<b>- You're a singer and a dancer,</b>
<b>so you could do LaLa,</b>

11:08.267 --> 11:10.770
<b>and Sharon Frockovich</b>
<b>can be Trixie.</b>

11:12.138 --> 11:14.573
<b>- Morgan's, like, what roles</b>
<b>are you guys drawn to?</b>

11:14.640 --> 11:16.275
<b>And I'm like, well, I like</b>
<b>this one and this one,</b>

11:16.342 --> 11:17.376
<b>and she goes, great.</b>

11:17.443 --> 11:18.644
<b>I'm gonna give you</b>
<b>this other one.</b>

11:18.711 --> 11:20.980
<b>Not only do I not think</b>
<b>this role is very funny,</b>

11:21.047 --> 11:23.249
<b>but it's a million lines.</b>

11:23.316 --> 11:25.484
<b>Also, I didn't want to wear</b>
<b>brown hair.</b>

11:26.485 --> 11:28.154
<b>Oh!</b>

11:28.220 --> 11:30.022
<b>- Coming up...</b>

11:30.156 --> 11:32.325
<b>- All right, bridesmaids,</b>
<b>who's hungry?</b>

11:32.391 --> 11:33.359
<b>- [laughs]</b>

11:33.426 --> 11:35.928
<b>- Wow, jazz!</b>

11:39.966 --> 11:40.700
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

11:42.563 --> 11:44.532
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

11:46.367 --> 11:48.136
<b>- Hello.</b>
<b>- Hello.</b>

11:48.202 --> 11:52.140
<b>- It's time for us to film</b>
<b>the new blockbuster,</b>

11:52.206 --> 11:54.909
<b>"My Best Squirrelfriend's</b>
<b>Wedding--"</b>

11:54.976 --> 11:56.577
<b>What?</b>

11:56.644 --> 12:00.248
<b>"My Best Squirrelfriend's</b>
<b>Wedding" something.</b>

12:00.314 --> 12:02.850
<b>"Dragsmaid's Wedding Strip."</b>

12:02.917 --> 12:05.887
<b>Let somebody else</b>
<b>have that line, baby.</b>

12:05.953 --> 12:09.857
<b>- Welcome to the Ross Mathews</b>
<b>Drag School of Overacting.</b>

12:09.924 --> 12:11.492
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

12:11.559 --> 12:13.528
<b>- This is our beautiful</b>
<b>bridal suite</b>

12:13.594 --> 12:15.897
<b>with furnishings by Objects.</b>

12:15.963 --> 12:18.599
<b>Are you ready to snatch all</b>
<b>the trophies of award season?</b>

12:18.666 --> 12:20.401
<b>- Yeah. [laughs]</b>
<b>- Places!</b>

12:20.468 --> 12:22.136
<b>Places, ladies!</b>

12:22.203 --> 12:23.438
<b>Okay, action!</b>

12:23.504 --> 12:26.307
<b>- All right, Bridesmaids,</b>
<b>who's hungry?</b>

12:26.374 --> 12:28.076
<b>Oh, hey, Queen.</b>

12:28.142 --> 12:30.411
<b>- It appears</b>
<b>we are first to arrive.</b>

12:30.478 --> 12:33.381
<b>- No [bleep], Sherlock.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

12:33.448 --> 12:37.885
<b>- Don't you mean no, [bleep],</b>
<b>your Royal Highness?</b>

12:37.952 --> 12:40.254
<b>- Cut. Sorry.</b>
<b>BeBe, can you just be louder?</b>

12:40.321 --> 12:41.756
<b>Can you just project</b>
<b>a little more?</b>

12:41.823 --> 12:44.025
<b>Look, I know you're being</b>
<b>proper, but let us hear it.</b>

12:44.092 --> 12:46.227
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>I got here a bit early</b>

12:46.260 --> 12:49.831
<b>because I planned</b>
<b>to be assuming the role</b>

12:49.897 --> 12:51.933
<b>of Sharon's matron of honor.</b>

12:52.000 --> 12:54.469
<b>- Cut. BeBe,</b>
<b>some of the line readings</b>

12:54.535 --> 12:55.770
<b>are feeling a little stiff.</b>

12:55.837 --> 12:57.238
<b>It's the School of Overacting.</b>

12:57.305 --> 13:01.242
<b>Exaggerate. Got it?</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

13:01.242 --> 13:03.311
<b>- Now, I never met the Queen,</b>

13:03.378 --> 13:05.780
<b>but I'm noticing</b>
<b>that BeBe's character</b>

13:05.847 --> 13:08.916
<b>is just BeBe doing BeBe.</b>

13:08.983 --> 13:10.651
<b>Where is the damn queen?</b>

13:10.718 --> 13:12.053
<b>- Sorry I'm late.</b>

13:12.120 --> 13:13.421
<b>I was down at City Hall</b>

13:13.488 --> 13:16.958
<b>shaking my tits</b>
<b>for the sake of justice.</b>

13:17.025 --> 13:19.527
<b>I'm so happy y'all are here.</b>

13:19.594 --> 13:21.696
<b>- Mwah.</b>

13:21.763 --> 13:23.364
<b>Okay, I forgot.</b>
<b>Not a hugger.</b>

13:23.431 --> 13:25.433
<b>- [laughs]</b>

13:25.500 --> 13:26.834
<b>- Sharon Frockovich</b>
<b>is not the role I asked for,</b>

13:26.901 --> 13:28.970
<b>but once I get out there</b>
<b>and I get the laughs,</b>

13:29.037 --> 13:31.472
<b>I'm, like, this role</b>
<b>is actually a gift.</b>

13:31.539 --> 13:34.275
<b>- Sorry I'm late.</b>

13:34.308 --> 13:37.612
<b>Traffic was crazy,</b>
<b>the sky was hazy,</b>

13:37.679 --> 13:44.052
<b>my driver was lazy,</b>
<b>and, wow, jazz!</b>

13:47.522 --> 13:49.090
<b>- I'm so glad you're here.</b>

13:49.223 --> 13:51.225
<b>I thought you were coming</b>
<b>with Beige Swan.</b>

14:04.005 --> 14:05.707
<b>- She did that.</b>

14:05.773 --> 14:07.709
<b>- Cut. Real quick,</b>
<b>Morgan, when you come out,</b>

14:07.775 --> 14:09.844
<b>are you gonna do any,</b>
<b>like, noises or anything?</b>

14:09.911 --> 14:11.679
<b>Because it's your big entrance,</b>
<b>your big moment.</b>

14:11.746 --> 14:13.014
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Let's try again.</b>

14:13.081 --> 14:15.416
<b>- I thought you were coming</b>
<b>with Beige Swan.</b>

14:15.483 --> 14:17.518
<b>- [hisses]</b>

14:17.585 --> 14:20.822
<b>- Girl, that ain't--oh.</b>

14:22.023 --> 14:23.658
<b>- [hiss]</b>

14:23.725 --> 14:26.694
<b>[hiss]</b>

14:26.761 --> 14:28.463
<b>- All right.</b>

14:28.529 --> 14:29.931
<b>- Okay, cut.</b>

14:29.998 --> 14:31.799
<b>Morgan, honey,</b>
<b>are you loving the hissing?</b>

14:31.866 --> 14:32.900
<b>Is there something funnier?</b>

14:32.967 --> 14:34.302
<b>Because it's like</b>
<b>you're coming in</b>

14:34.369 --> 14:35.570
<b>and you're, like, clearly</b>

14:35.636 --> 14:37.271
<b>kind of off your rocker</b>
<b>a little bit, right?</b>

14:37.305 --> 14:39.273
<b>But we're going for funny.</b>

14:39.273 --> 14:41.275
<b>A swan noise. I don't know.</b>
<b>I don't know what it is.</b>

14:41.275 --> 14:45.246
<b>- They only actually hiss.</b>
<b>That's if humans come near them.</b>

14:45.313 --> 14:46.781
<b>- Oh, wow, you are method.</b>

14:46.848 --> 14:49.884
<b>Whatever you're gonna do,</b>
<b>I want you to commit to it.</b>

14:49.951 --> 14:51.419
<b>I mean, because</b>
<b>remember "Black Swan?"</b>

14:51.486 --> 14:53.821
<b>She was kind of like--</b>
<b>- She was a nut job.</b>

14:53.888 --> 14:56.691
<b>- You can make it campier,</b>
<b>just do it a hundred.</b>

14:56.758 --> 14:58.793
<b>- Morgan, dead on arrival.</b>

14:58.860 --> 15:02.130
<b>I actually saw her</b>
<b>as a Sharon Frockovich,</b>

15:02.230 --> 15:04.098
<b>like a slutty</b>
<b>kind of confrontational,</b>

15:04.232 --> 15:06.901
<b>so I'm just like, big mistake.</b>

15:06.968 --> 15:08.336
<b>Huge.</b>

15:09.837 --> 15:10.905
<b>- Coming up...</b>

15:10.972 --> 15:13.241
<b>- You nailed it.</b>
<b>- You were so much fun.</b>

15:13.307 --> 15:14.976
<b>- I got a little excited.</b>
<b>I'm single.</b>

15:15.043 --> 15:15.977
<b>[all laugh]</b>

15:16.044 --> 15:16.844
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

15:18.627 --> 15:20.596
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

15:22.398 --> 15:25.601
<b>- Aah!</b>
<b>- Another day!</b>

15:25.668 --> 15:28.637
<b>It's time to get ready for</b>
<b>today's runway, Red for Filth.</b>

15:28.704 --> 15:31.607
<b>The elimination tonight</b>
<b>is gonna be super important</b>

15:31.674 --> 15:35.211
<b>because next week RuPaul</b>
<b>crowns an All Star.</b>

15:36.545 --> 15:38.047
<b>- Tell you what.</b>
<b>After Adam Lambert last week,</b>

15:38.114 --> 15:40.249
<b>I was trying to smile at Ross</b>
<b>the whole time.</b>

15:40.316 --> 15:42.218
<b>[laughs] Hah.</b>

15:42.284 --> 15:46.088
<b>- It felt like you were,</b>
<b>like, over me being there.</b>

15:46.155 --> 15:48.457
<b>- Were you bothered when Adam</b>
<b>said that you were standoffish?</b>

15:48.524 --> 15:50.793
<b>- Well, only because</b>
<b>people have told me before</b>

15:50.860 --> 15:53.095
<b>that my tone is just so dry</b>
<b>that they thought I was angry.</b>

15:53.162 --> 15:56.399
<b>- Sometimes, Trixilicious,</b>
<b>you don't mean to give that off.</b>

15:56.465 --> 15:57.700
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- But it's unintentional.</b>

15:57.767 --> 16:00.136
<b>- Oh, girl, because</b>
<b>perception is reality.</b>

16:00.202 --> 16:03.005
<b>I might accidentally sometimes</b>
<b>come off as standoffish.</b>

16:03.072 --> 16:07.143
<b>I mean, Trixie on stage</b>
<b>is fun and bubbly,</b>

16:07.209 --> 16:08.644
<b>but me and in real life,</b>

16:08.711 --> 16:10.312
<b>a lot of the times I'm just,</b>
<b>like, a boring white dude</b>

16:10.379 --> 16:13.816
<b>who doesn't like hugs,</b>
<b>so I get how that can read.</b>

16:13.883 --> 16:17.653
<b>It's something I always have</b>
<b>wanted to change about myself.</b>

16:17.720 --> 16:20.356
<b>Our whole industry</b>
<b>is interpersonal communications.</b>

16:20.423 --> 16:21.924
<b>If you're not friendly enough,</b>
<b>someone thinks you're a jerk.</b>

16:21.991 --> 16:24.160
<b>Remember that thing</b>
<b>in West Hollywood, Morgan,</b>

16:24.293 --> 16:26.829
<b>when I got tweets</b>
<b>from other "Drag Race" girls</b>

16:26.896 --> 16:28.497
<b>saying that I was acting grand?</b>

16:28.564 --> 16:30.499
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>- I'm not super social,</b>

16:30.566 --> 16:32.668
<b>so a lot of times I'm just</b>
<b>saving it for the audience.</b>

16:34.403 --> 16:35.771
<b>- Look, out</b>
<b>of the "Drag Race" alum,</b>

16:35.838 --> 16:37.773
<b>there are queens</b>
<b>that are definitely known</b>

16:37.840 --> 16:41.310
<b>for being generous with</b>
<b>local queens and the fans,</b>

16:41.310 --> 16:43.112
<b>and then there are also queens</b>
<b>that are the exact opposite.</b>

16:43.179 --> 16:45.848
<b>Trixie has been called out</b>
<b>about how she treated them</b>

16:45.915 --> 16:47.483
<b>when she was in their company.</b>

16:47.550 --> 16:48.984
<b>As much as I love her,</b>

16:49.051 --> 16:52.922
<b>if she thinks that</b>
<b>she's not, like, a little grand,</b>

16:52.988 --> 16:54.323
<b>she's fooling herself.</b>

16:54.356 --> 16:57.059
<b>- They say that about me.</b>
<b>"Oh, she's too bougie."</b>

16:57.126 --> 16:59.161
<b>- BeBe, you don't think</b>
<b>you come off a little bougie?</b>

16:59.228 --> 17:01.330
<b>- Do you think I do, girl?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

17:01.363 --> 17:05.935
<b>You are a little bougie, and you</b>
<b>give the girls looks, like this.</b>

17:06.001 --> 17:08.971
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- Brava. You would think</b>

17:09.038 --> 17:11.540
<b>that she is of the royal family</b>
<b>of Zamunda, bitch.</b>

17:11.607 --> 17:14.210
<b>Go to Wikipedia.com.</b>

17:14.343 --> 17:16.712
<b>Mama, you are the definition</b>
<b>of bougie.</b>

17:16.779 --> 17:18.614
<b>- I have this side that</b>
<b>is always very regal, but--</b>

17:18.681 --> 17:20.416
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>
<b>- I am very goofy.</b>

17:20.483 --> 17:22.151
<b>- Mama, I know.</b>
<b>I'm not--</b>

17:22.284 --> 17:23.419
<b>Please don't take it</b>
<b>the wrong way.</b>

17:23.486 --> 17:24.653
<b>I'm not saying that--</b>
<b>- No, not at all.</b>

17:24.720 --> 17:26.822
<b>- I'm just saying,</b>
<b>you do have an air.</b>

17:28.657 --> 17:30.760
<b>[all laugh]</b>

17:30.826 --> 17:34.130
<b>- Oh, she can't be bothered?</b>
<b>Oh, okay. Okay.</b>

17:34.196 --> 17:36.165
<b>- See, I'm the opposite.</b>

17:36.298 --> 17:38.334
<b>My favorite thing</b>
<b>in the entire world</b>

17:38.401 --> 17:39.435
<b>is when I'm at Mickey's</b>

17:39.502 --> 17:40.936
<b>and there's girls</b>
<b>in the audience</b>

17:41.003 --> 17:42.738
<b>and I get to</b>
<b>bring them up on stage,</b>

17:42.805 --> 17:44.006
<b>even if it's just to watch.</b>

17:44.073 --> 17:45.508
<b>- You're very that girl.</b>
<b>You will call out girls</b>

17:45.574 --> 17:46.909
<b>even though we don't want</b>
<b>to be called out sometimes.</b>

17:46.976 --> 17:48.344
<b>- Girl,</b>
<b>I'd be trying to hide.</b>

17:48.411 --> 17:49.478
<b>I like to go to drag shows</b>

17:49.545 --> 17:50.579
<b>where they don't know</b>
<b>I'm there,</b>

17:50.646 --> 17:52.081
<b>and they don't know,</b>
<b>you know--</b>

17:52.148 --> 17:53.649
<b>I just want to see</b>
<b>the drag show.</b>

17:53.716 --> 17:55.951
<b>- My thing is that I really--</b>
<b>my features are so distinct,</b>

17:56.018 --> 17:57.686
<b>as soon as I open my voice,</b>
<b>they're like, ooh.</b>

17:57.753 --> 18:00.156
<b>- See, that's my whole purpose</b>
<b>of being in "All Star 3."</b>

18:00.222 --> 18:03.325
<b>I want to be that girl,</b>
<b>because before All Stars,</b>

18:03.392 --> 18:07.063
<b>it was like, oh, yeah,</b>
<b>Kennedy's here, yay!</b>

18:07.129 --> 18:08.697
<b>Second thought.</b>

25:39.714 --> 25:41.649
<b>you were so much fun</b>

<b>because every take</b>
<b>you tried something new.</b>

25:44.418 --> 25:46.053
<b>- And that moment</b>
<b>when you used the baby's hand</b>

25:46.120 --> 25:47.822
<b>to wipe your hair, I died.</b>

25:47.889 --> 25:50.091

<b>out of the Trixie Mattel box,</b>

26:08.676 --> 26:09.744

26:10.745 --> 26:11.612
<b>on the highlighter on the nose,</b>

26:11.679 --> 26:13.614

26:13.681 --> 26:14.849
<b>- When it came</b>
<b>to the acting challenge,</b>

26:14.916 --> 26:16.717
<b>I thought you were</b>
<b>maybe a little more,</b>

26:16.784 --> 26:18.619
<b>like, Jodie Foster</b>
<b>in "Nell,"</b>

<b>than Emma Stone</b>
<b>in "La La Land."</b>

26:21.889 --> 26:23.090
<b>I was kind of hoping</b>

<b>you know.</b>

26:24.792 --> 26:27.061
<b>She's very serious</b>
<b>about everything.</b>

26:27.128 --> 26:29.030
<b>- It was kind of one note.</b>

26:29.096 --> 26:31.232
<b>She kept doing the same thing</b>
<b>over and over.</b>

26:31.365 --> 26:33.601
<b>- Pow! Pow!</b>

26:33.668 --> 26:34.769
<b>- And it really</b>
<b>didn't go anymore.</b>

26:34.836 --> 26:38.005
<b>- Up next,</b>
<b>Morgan McMichaels.</b>

26:38.072 --> 26:39.974
<b>- Tonight you're dressed</b>
<b>like Judy Garland</b>

26:40.041 --> 26:41.375
<b>in "Meet Me in St. Louis."</b>

26:41.442 --> 26:43.377
<b>Like, even though your boobs</b>
<b>are hanging right out--</b>

26:43.411 --> 26:44.579
<b>- I was feeling</b>
<b>my Michelle moment.</b>

26:44.645 --> 26:45.580
<b>- There you go.</b>

<b>This is so beautiful.</b>

26:54.555 --> 26:56.591
<b>If I were in your heels,</b>

26:56.657 --> 26:59.594
<b>I would have picked</b>
<b>Beige Swan last.</b>

26:59.660 --> 27:03.130
<b>That's a tough role,</b>
<b>because to play crazy,</b>

27:03.197 --> 27:06.834
<b>you either have to play</b>
<b>so over-the-top crazy,</b>

27:06.901 --> 27:09.370
<b>or you have to play that</b>
<b>you're concealing you're crazy.</b>

27:09.437 --> 27:12.440
<b>I worked with you the most,</b>
<b>and I got you to quack.</b>

27:12.507 --> 27:14.208
<b>- Quack, quack, quack.</b>

27:14.342 --> 27:16.210
<b>- I wanted even more.</b>

27:16.344 --> 27:17.245
<b>- Thank you, ladies.</b>

27:17.345 --> 27:19.747
<b>Based on</b>
<b>the judges' critiques,</b>

27:19.814 --> 27:22.183
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

27:24.552 --> 27:27.722
<b>- Shangela, Trixie Mattel,</b>

27:27.788 --> 27:29.023
<b>con-drag-ulations.</b>

27:29.090 --> 27:31.659
<b>You are the top two All Stars</b>
<b>of the week.</b>

27:31.726 --> 27:32.727
<b>[applause]</b>

27:32.793 --> 27:34.362
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Word.</b>

27:34.362 --> 27:39.667
<b>- You've each won a $1,000</b>
<b>gift card from Elea's Closet,</b>

27:39.734 --> 27:42.737
<b>and a set of luggage</b>
<b>from Raden luggage.</b>

27:42.804 --> 27:46.641
<b>- This week,</b>
<b>if you're not in the top,</b>

27:46.707 --> 27:47.675
<b>you're in the bottom.</b>

27:47.742 --> 27:51.045
<b>That means BeBe,</b>
<b>Kennedy, Morgan,</b>

27:51.112 --> 27:52.713
<b>you are the bottom three.</b>

27:55.516 --> 27:59.787
<b>Shangela, Trixie,</b>
<b>each of you needs to decide</b>

27:59.854 --> 28:02.957
<b>which of the bottom three</b>
<b>you'll eliminate</b>

28:03.024 --> 28:05.560
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

28:05.626 --> 28:08.663
<b>So while you queens</b>
<b>deliberate in the workroom,</b>

28:08.729 --> 28:10.031
<b>the judges and I</b>

28:10.097 --> 28:13.701
<b>will be contacting</b>
<b>our elected representatives.</b>

28:13.768 --> 28:15.169
<b>[telephone rings]</b>
<b>Thank you, ladies.</b>

28:15.236 --> 28:17.338
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

28:17.405 --> 28:19.040
<b>- Coming up...</b>

28:19.106 --> 28:20.608
<b>- I thought I gave</b>
<b>as much as I could.</b>

28:20.675 --> 28:22.543
<b>- I can't crush</b>
<b>a friend's dream.</b>

28:22.610 --> 28:25.046
<b>- I'm very proud of what I did.</b>

28:25.112 --> 28:27.748
<b>- Who gives a [bleep], okay?</b>

28:29.150 --> 28:29.884
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

28:31.727 --> 28:34.096
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

28:34.163 --> 28:36.799
<b>- Ooh!</b>

28:36.866 --> 28:38.601
<b>- So I'm in the bottom.</b>

28:38.668 --> 28:40.570
<b>And the curse</b>
<b>of the returning queen</b>

28:40.636 --> 28:41.904
<b>is that most of us go home</b>

28:41.971 --> 28:44.240
<b>the episode</b>
<b>after we've returned,</b>

28:44.307 --> 28:45.374
<b>and I do not want that.</b>

28:45.441 --> 28:47.243
<b>I want to break the curse.</b>

28:47.310 --> 28:48.678
<b>- Well, I want to say</b>
<b>congratulations</b>

28:48.744 --> 28:50.479
<b>to Trixie and Shangela.</b>

28:50.546 --> 28:51.714
<b>- Oh, thank you.</b>

28:51.781 --> 28:53.482
<b>- You guys did an amazing job.</b>

28:53.549 --> 28:55.685
<b>- I feel good about what I did.</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

28:55.751 --> 28:58.621
<b>I mean, it's all</b>
<b>strong forces, you know?</b>

28:58.688 --> 29:01.123
<b>But I know for sure</b>
<b>that I didn't do a bad job.</b>

29:01.190 --> 29:03.359
<b>- I thought I gave</b>
<b>as much as I could.</b>

29:03.426 --> 29:05.895
<b>I think the Queen</b>
<b>would have been a lot of fun,</b>

29:05.962 --> 29:07.864
<b>but, I mean, I just didn't</b>
<b>want to do something</b>

29:07.930 --> 29:09.665
<b>that would have</b>
<b>been expected of me.</b>

29:09.732 --> 29:13.002
<b>- Morgan, you know, she got</b>
<b>an opportunity to come back,</b>

29:13.069 --> 29:15.505
<b>and if you only have one chance,</b>

29:15.571 --> 29:17.139
<b>don't try nothing new.</b>

29:17.206 --> 29:18.374
<b>Stick to what you know.</b>

29:18.441 --> 29:21.477
<b>Who gives a [bleep], okay?</b>

29:21.544 --> 29:25.381
<b>- BeBe, how do you feel?</b>
<b>Because you seem really quiet.</b>

29:25.448 --> 29:26.983
<b>- I personally feel</b>

29:27.049 --> 29:29.619
<b>that if you read the description</b>
<b>of who my character is,</b>

29:29.685 --> 29:31.888
<b>she was very stuffy,</b>
<b>very uptight.</b>

29:31.954 --> 29:34.390
<b>I was trying</b>
<b>to be that character.</b>

29:34.457 --> 29:35.758
<b>I'm very proud of what I did.</b>

29:35.825 --> 29:38.227
<b>When you look at all the girls,</b>

29:38.294 --> 29:40.163
<b>I've been the most consistent.</b>

29:40.229 --> 29:41.831
<b>Yes, there is a top two,</b>

29:41.898 --> 29:44.100
<b>then everybody down there</b>
<b>becomes the bottom.</b>

29:44.167 --> 29:47.503
<b>But I've stayed safe</b>
<b>and I've won challenges.</b>

29:47.570 --> 29:51.941
<b>I should stay.</b>

29:52.008 --> 29:53.643
<b>- If my face</b>
<b>looked like yours right now,</b>

29:53.709 --> 29:56.412
<b>I would never cover it</b>
<b>in my life.</b>

29:56.479 --> 29:58.214
<b>You look so beautiful.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

29:58.281 --> 29:59.682
<b>- You look like Ornacia,</b>
<b>but like--</b>

29:59.749 --> 30:01.050
<b>- Oh! [laughs]</b>

30:01.117 --> 30:02.685
<b>- Who's Ornacia?</b>
<b>I don't know who that is.</b>

30:05.221 --> 30:06.822
<b>- She's fully</b>
<b>never seen "Drag Race."</b>

30:06.889 --> 30:08.324
<b>- Then mannequin head, girl.</b>

30:08.424 --> 30:10.760
<b>- BeBe won "Drag Race,"</b>
<b>and stopped watching it.</b>

30:10.826 --> 30:12.295
<b>- No, no, it's not that.</b>

30:12.428 --> 30:13.796
<b>- You didn't watch</b>
<b>"RuPaul's Drag Race,"</b>

30:13.863 --> 30:15.498
<b>the show</b>
<b>that gave you your career?</b>

30:15.565 --> 30:17.433
<b>Are we all beneath you?</b>

30:17.500 --> 30:18.968
<b>You couldn't watch us on the TV?</b>

30:19.035 --> 30:22.004
<b>Oh, okay, I see.</b>

30:22.071 --> 30:23.573
<b>- Girl, get ready.</b>

30:23.639 --> 30:25.908
<b>They gonna "me-me"</b>
<b>your ass to death, bitch.</b>

30:25.975 --> 30:27.443
<b>- Wait, what is "me-me?"</b>

30:27.443 --> 30:29.846
<b>- You know how they, um--</b>

30:29.912 --> 30:31.647
<b>- Meme.</b>
<b>- Yeah, that.</b>

30:31.714 --> 30:34.250
<b>[all laugh]</b>

30:36.052 --> 30:37.753
<b>- I'm in a nightmare.</b>

30:37.820 --> 30:39.088
<b>BeBe's never seen "Drag Race."</b>

30:39.155 --> 30:40.756
<b>Kennedy doesn't know</b>
<b>what a meme is.</b>

30:40.823 --> 30:44.193
<b>Winning the crown</b>
<b>is the only way out alive.</b>

30:44.260 --> 30:46.596
<b>Would you guys like to sit</b>
<b>on a sofa and possibly cry?</b>

30:46.662 --> 30:49.565
<b>- I'll go first, [bleep].</b>
<b>- Yeah, come on, BeBe.</b>

30:49.632 --> 30:52.201
<b>- Let's have a sister</b>
<b>conversation.</b>

30:52.268 --> 30:53.436
<b>- Well, [bleep]</b>

30:55.171 --> 30:58.407
<b>- So tell me why you made such</b>
<b>a mess of this whole challenge?</b>

30:58.474 --> 31:00.676
<b>- Oh, honey, I did not make a</b>
<b>mess of this whole challenge,</b>

31:00.743 --> 31:04.413
<b>because when I sit and listen</b>
<b>to what the judges have to say,</b>

31:04.413 --> 31:06.949
<b>I mean, it was like, oh, well,</b>
<b>you were kinda quiet.</b>

31:07.016 --> 31:09.085
<b>I wish you could have</b>
<b>played her over the top.</b>

31:09.151 --> 31:11.888
<b>If those are the critiques</b>
<b>you're giving me right now,</b>

31:11.954 --> 31:14.991
<b>I must have done something</b>
<b>great, and that's the way I am.</b>

31:15.057 --> 31:16.692
<b>- BeBe has, like,</b>
<b>an unshakeable confidence,</b>

31:16.759 --> 31:19.695
<b>which in a lot of ways</b>
<b>is a huge asset.</b>

31:19.762 --> 31:22.098
<b>But on the other hand, girl,</b>
<b>you did get negative critiques,</b>

31:22.165 --> 31:23.432
<b>and you're, like,</b>
<b>fully pretending</b>

31:23.499 --> 31:24.567
<b>like it didn't happen.</b>

31:24.634 --> 31:25.735
<b>I was there.</b>

31:25.801 --> 31:27.336
<b>- You've seen my track record.</b>

31:27.436 --> 31:28.704
<b>You know my work.</b>

31:28.771 --> 31:30.840
<b>If you value what I bring</b>
<b>to the competition,</b>

31:30.907 --> 31:32.708
<b>then I would want to trust</b>

31:32.775 --> 31:35.611
<b>that you would make</b>
<b>the right decision.</b>

31:37.013 --> 31:38.381
<b>- Okay, let me ask you this.</b>

31:38.447 --> 31:39.749
<b>Who would you send to the house?</b>

31:39.815 --> 31:41.083
<b>- [bleep].</b>

31:41.150 --> 31:42.285
<b>I didn't win.</b>

31:42.385 --> 31:45.655
<b>- No, bitch.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

31:45.721 --> 31:48.224
<b>- Listen, I'm not</b>
<b>sending Kennedy home.</b>

31:48.291 --> 31:52.495
<b>She's been a rock for me</b>
<b>in this competition as a friend,</b>

31:52.562 --> 31:56.032
<b>and I want to know</b>
<b>what she has to say</b>

31:56.098 --> 31:57.867
<b>because this is really a hard</b>
<b>choice for just one person.</b>

31:57.934 --> 32:01.037
<b>- I was thinking about Morgan,</b>
<b>because she struggled the most.</b>

32:01.103 --> 32:03.039
<b>- In that challenge, yes, ma'am.</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

32:03.105 --> 32:06.475
<b>- But do you think that's enough</b>
<b>to send her to the house?</b>

32:07.877 --> 32:10.012
<b>I know Morgan</b>
<b>didn't do her best,</b>

32:10.079 --> 32:11.848
<b>but I don't want to be the one</b>
<b>to send her to the house</b>

32:11.914 --> 32:14.317
<b>before she's had a chance</b>
<b>to really shine.</b>

32:14.417 --> 32:15.585
<b>This is her second chance,</b>

32:15.651 --> 32:17.186
<b>and, look, I know</b>
<b>about second chances,</b>

32:17.253 --> 32:20.056
<b>and I can't crush</b>
<b>a friend's dream.</b>

32:20.122 --> 32:22.258
<b>- On the other hand,</b>
<b>you have BeBe,</b>

32:22.325 --> 32:24.427
<b>who could have dove in it more.</b>

32:24.427 --> 32:25.761
<b>- But in this challenge,</b>

32:25.828 --> 32:29.098
<b>I don't even think she feels</b>
<b>she did anything wrong.</b>

32:29.165 --> 32:33.369
<b>- Right. I kind of put her</b>
<b>in the place of where Milk was.</b>

32:33.369 --> 32:35.838
<b>- Miss BeBe</b>
<b>is a fantastic queen.</b>

32:35.905 --> 32:38.941
<b>However, when you don't think</b>
<b>you have any flaws,</b>

32:39.008 --> 32:40.776
<b>that's a flaw.</b>

32:40.843 --> 32:44.013
<b>- Either way you go,</b>
<b>you have just cause.</b>

32:45.281 --> 32:47.283
<b>- Uh-huh. Okay.</b>
<b>[telephones ring]</b>

32:47.383 --> 32:50.586
<b>- Ru, Elizabeth Warren</b>
<b>says hi-ee.</b>

32:50.653 --> 32:52.555
<b>- Oh. Tell her</b>
<b>I said, hey, girl, hey.</b>

32:52.622 --> 32:56.859
<b>- Kamala Harris, tell the GOP</b>
<b>to stay out of my uterus.</b>

32:56.926 --> 33:00.163
<b>- Wow. Cory Booker</b>
<b>just retweeted me.</b>

33:00.229 --> 33:02.732
<b>- Ross, did you get through</b>
<b>to the president?</b>

33:02.798 --> 33:05.168
<b>- No. I think my fax paper</b>
<b>is jammed.</b>

33:05.234 --> 33:06.869
<b>- Keep trying.</b>

33:06.936 --> 33:08.738
<b>Who knew it was so easy</b>

33:08.804 --> 33:11.774
<b>to contact your congressman</b>
<b>or congresswoman?</b>

33:11.841 --> 33:13.976
<b>All you gotta do</b>
<b>is go to house.gov</b>

33:14.043 --> 33:15.912
<b>and punch in your zip code.</b>

33:15.978 --> 33:18.247
<b>It's just that easy. Bam!</b>

33:18.314 --> 33:20.449
<b>[telephone rings]</b>
<b>Hello? Maxine?</b>

33:20.516 --> 33:22.885
<b>- I like how you got</b>
<b>this demure look,</b>

33:22.952 --> 33:25.254
<b>but you still found a way</b>
<b>to make it a full hooker.</b>

33:25.321 --> 33:27.256
<b>- Well, you know,</b>

33:27.323 --> 33:29.025
<b>there's something to be said</b>
<b>about talent.</b>

33:29.091 --> 33:32.562
<b>Both Trixie and Shangela</b>
<b>have been in my position.</b>

33:32.628 --> 33:34.964
<b>They've both left</b>
<b>the competition and come back,</b>

33:35.031 --> 33:37.800
<b>so maybe they both have</b>
<b>a little bit more insight</b>

33:37.867 --> 33:39.602
<b>to what is going on in my head,</b>

33:39.669 --> 33:41.771
<b>and I want to get</b>
<b>to the top four.</b>

33:41.838 --> 33:43.739
<b>I just want it so bad.</b>

33:43.806 --> 33:46.108
<b>I haven't been here.</b>

33:46.175 --> 33:47.376
<b>Like, Kennedy and BeBe</b>

33:47.443 --> 33:49.812
<b>have rolled with you guys</b>
<b>from the jump.</b>

33:49.879 --> 33:52.048
<b>So that makes me feel</b>
<b>a little, like,</b>

33:52.114 --> 33:53.816
<b>well, maybe I might be going.</b>

33:53.883 --> 33:55.251
<b>- When I came back</b>
<b>on "Drag Race,"</b>

33:55.384 --> 33:57.820
<b>I felt like everybody</b>
<b>was happy to have me there,</b>

33:57.887 --> 33:59.722
<b>but I did feel</b>
<b>like I wasn't sure</b>

33:59.789 --> 34:01.891
<b>if there was a way</b>
<b>I could possibly stick around,</b>

34:01.958 --> 34:03.092
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

34:03.159 --> 34:04.994
<b>- Like the uneasiness</b>
<b>is unsettling.</b>

34:05.061 --> 34:06.395
<b>- I feel you.</b>

34:06.429 --> 34:09.532
<b>Morgan needed to basically</b>
<b>walk on water yesterday,</b>

34:09.599 --> 34:10.766
<b>and instead she drowned.</b>

34:10.833 --> 34:12.068
<b>- I live for you.</b>

34:12.134 --> 34:13.536
<b>- But I kind of have sympathy</b>
<b>for Morgan.</b>

34:13.603 --> 34:15.438
<b>I know what it's like</b>
<b>to have to get back into it</b>

34:15.505 --> 34:18.708
<b>and get in the same mindset as</b>
<b>people who have been competing.</b>

34:18.774 --> 34:21.110
<b>So I don't know.</b>

34:22.512 --> 34:24.413
<b>- Silence!</b>

34:24.447 --> 34:30.253
<b>Actually, silence equals death,</b>
<b>so keep going on those phones.</b>

34:30.319 --> 34:31.754
<b>Democracy is at stake.</b>

34:31.821 --> 34:34.657
<b>And bring back my girls!</b>

<b>[all answering]</b>

34:42.031 --> 34:44.901
<b>- Three great queens,</b>
<b>and as I look at their names,</b>

34:44.967 --> 34:46.435
<b>I want to make sure</b>
<b>I've considered everything.</b>

34:46.502 --> 34:48.037
<b>[exhales]</b>

<b>There's somebody who's been in</b>
<b>the bottom for the first time.</b>

<b>There's somebody</b>
<b>who's making their comeback.</b>

34:51.674 --> 34:53.543
<b>There's somebody</b>
<b>who has won challenges,</b>

34:53.609 --> 34:54.677
<b>but is in the bottom again.</b>

34:54.744 --> 34:56.045
<b>I have to make a decision,</b>

34:56.112 --> 34:57.780
<b>so I'm making a decision.</b>

34:59.182 --> 35:01.517
<b>- I'm really confused</b>
<b>right now.</b>

35:01.584 --> 35:04.420
<b>BeBe, Morgan, BeBe, Morgan,</b>
<b>BeBe, Morgan, I don't know.</b>

35:04.487 --> 35:05.788
<b>[exhales]</b>

<b>I might lose a friend over this.</b>

<b>In this moment,</b>
<b>I'm Natalie Imbruglia: "Torn."</b>

<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

35:27.935 --> 35:30.871
<b>Two All Stars stand before me.</b>

35:30.938 --> 35:34.275
<b>Ladies, this is your chance</b>
<b>to impress me,</b>

<b>win $10,000,</b>
