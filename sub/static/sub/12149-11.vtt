00:56.530 --> 00:59.549
There's a 503 on the corner
of Wilshire and Vermont,

01:00.130 --> 01:03.429
Owner says he spotted his auto
two blocks around location,

01:06.129 --> 01:08.230
One Mary 20, do you have a name?

01:08.530 --> 01:09.900
- Where?
- There, detective.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.269
It's the same guy.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.760
This makes three.
He's just getting started.

02:14.849 --> 02:18.219
It's the city of dreams.
A mystical oasis...

02:19.050 --> 02:21.539
...willed from a desert.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.860
But even sunny, blond L.A.
has its trashy, dark roots.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.930
And you've learned that
the hard way.

02:28.650 --> 02:32.789
You've talked to the police, but they
can't help, so you've come to us.

02:35.849 --> 02:37.879
I think it's about to speak.

02:39.449 --> 02:43.770
Nobody likes a smart-ass rogue demon
hunter.  What do you want, Wesley?

02:44.250 --> 02:48.530
Just thought we might compare battle
plans from our respective fronts.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.509
I thought you worked alone.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.930
Even a solitary soldier
such as myself recognizes...

02:55.650 --> 02:59.270
...that an exchange of intelligence
benefits the common struggle.

03:00.449 --> 03:03.639
- I brought in your mail and newspaper.
- Oh, thanks.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.509
- So, what have you got?
- Got?

03:07.050 --> 03:09.330
You wanted to compare
skinnies on evil.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.150
Yes, skinnies.  Precisely.

03:14.849 --> 03:16.530
Right.  Well...

03:17.250 --> 03:19.319
...everything seems quiet.

03:20.849 --> 03:24.219
Okay.  Well, thanks for stopping by.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.189
And you?

03:28.650 --> 03:30.400
How's your end of the fight?

03:31.050 --> 03:34.030
I'm selling to an empty chair.
What do you think?

03:34.650 --> 03:35.879
Quiet all around then.

03:39.449 --> 03:41.620
Well, I'll keep myself available.

03:41.849 --> 03:45.780
The situation can only escalate.
We made a most effective team.

03:46.650 --> 03:49.110
Vanquishing that empathy demon
in short order.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.930
Nobody gouged out my eyes,
so I'm happy.

03:52.650 --> 03:56.060
Yes, most effective.
Your cryptic visions.  Angel's brawn.

03:56.849 --> 03:58.879
My highly developed
powers of deduction--

03:59.250 --> 04:00.930
- This isn't our mail.
- Sorry?

04:02.250 --> 04:04.669
See here?
The dentist office next door.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.719
Oh, I see.  I didn't...

04:08.250 --> 04:09.439
...realize.

04:12.449 --> 04:14.770
Something wrong?
You stopped yammering.

04:17.850 --> 04:21.920
I suppose I should return
these items to their proper owner.

04:30.449 --> 04:32.699
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

04:33.449 --> 04:34.850
And Wesley.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.300
Remember that license plate
we got on that runaway case?

04:38.850 --> 04:40.360
You were gonna follow up.

04:40.649 --> 04:44.410
No go.  The DMV's stalker-phobic and--
Wow, you look half dead.

04:46.649 --> 04:50.370
Which, for someone who's completely
dead, would be kind of neat?

04:52.649 --> 04:54.259
License plate, Cordelia?

04:55.050 --> 04:58.560
I thought you could have Police Woman
run it for us on the QT.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.279
- Kate.
- Are you sure you're okay?

05:01.649 --> 05:04.879
For a guy who's 200-plus,
you're not usually with the bags.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.439
- I'll do this now.
- Hey!

05:07.050 --> 05:08.839
Look, I'm fine, Cordelia,
all right?

05:10.050 --> 05:11.379
All right.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.649
I'll take the tunnels.

05:41.850 --> 05:45.110
I'm not supposed to release
that information to a civilian.

05:46.050 --> 05:46.920
I know.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.759
- If it were anyone else.
- I appreciate it, Kate.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.519
I know you do.  So I don't mind.

05:54.449 --> 05:58.560
- I'll run it myself by morning.
- No rush.  Late afternoon.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.040
Evening will be fine.

06:01.050 --> 06:03.819
I won't mind getting
my head out of this case.

06:04.649 --> 06:06.720
- Even for a minute.
- Tough one?

06:07.649 --> 06:11.199
The first victim, Reggie Sparks,
volunteered as a crossing guard.

06:11.850 --> 06:14.019
Jinny Markem, just started 10th grade.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.269
And Jessica Halpren, 25,
worked as a waitress.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.480
Do you know what they have in common?

06:21.449 --> 06:23.339
What he did to them.  That's all.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.990
That's not all.  They have you.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.319
- The crime scene photos you wanted.
- Thanks.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.019
Stop by tomorrow.

06:36.449 --> 06:39.639
By then, I'll have invaded
a citizen's privacy for you--

06:47.250 --> 06:48.509
It's pretty grim.

06:49.050 --> 06:51.860
I've spent the last 48 hours
creating a profile.

06:52.050 --> 06:55.379
Being inside this guy's head
hasn't been a whole lot of fun.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.680
Tabloids call him "The Pope."
Probably thinks he's doing God's work.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.100
No.

07:02.850 --> 07:06.149
Just the opposite.
This is about mocking God.

07:09.449 --> 07:10.779
That's my guess.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.509
- Detective, they're ready for you now.
- Yeah, okay.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.579
Looks like it's show--

07:20.250 --> 07:21.329
--time.

07:23.850 --> 07:25.670
Our suspect will be a white male.

07:25.649 --> 07:27.790
To the observer
he won't seem a monster.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.720
His victims put up little struggle,
so he's likely charming, attractive.

07:33.449 --> 07:34.920
At his core, he's a loner.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.370
Possibly a dual personality
who, once the crime's done...

07:38.850 --> 07:40.920
...retains no memory of the act,

07:43.050 --> 07:47.620
He doesn't see his victims as subhuman
but himself as more than human.

07:48.449 --> 07:52.029
A superior species.  Stalking
his prey, getting to know them.

07:52.649 --> 07:53.699
He's likely unmarried...

07:54.449 --> 07:58.000
...though he may have recently ended
a long-term relationship badly.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.000
We look for a precipitating event
in these cases.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.389
A painful breakup is always
at the top of our list.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.300
Before failing, the relationship...

08:07.050 --> 08:09.959
...may have marked
an inactive period in his life,

08:10.649 --> 08:14.269
He would've regarded it
as a lifeline, his salvation,

08:14.850 --> 08:17.660
But once ended,
resulted in his recidivism,

08:22.050 --> 08:24.189
What's not in question
is his experience,

08:24.449 --> 08:28.170
He's been doing this for a very long
time and he will do it again,

08:45.529 --> 08:47.389
Jeez, Wesley.  Hover much?

08:47.929 --> 08:50.769
- Where is he? Where's Angel?
- Not here.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.759
- What's that?
- What it looks like.

08:55.129 --> 08:58.639
It's rude coming into a vampire's
office with one of those.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.860
- Could be misinterpreted.
- You recall this morning...

09:02.330 --> 09:05.240
...that mix-up with the
dentist's mail and newspaper?

09:05.929 --> 09:07.120
That's when I saw this.

09:07.730 --> 09:10.679
Oh, my God.  You cut up
Dr. Folger's newspaper?

09:11.330 --> 09:14.590
- You'll get us kicked out of here.
- What?  No, the clipping.

09:17.330 --> 09:20.309
"Third Body Found in Alley."
Not exactly front-page news.

09:20.929 --> 09:23.769
That is the front page.
Still, note the modus operandi.

09:24.529 --> 09:27.549
- Mutilation with the religious icon?
- I'm against it?

09:29.330 --> 09:31.049
I think you'd better sit down.

09:34.129 --> 09:38.409
During my duties as Watcher in
Sunnydale, I did extensive research.

09:38.929 --> 09:42.970
Specifically on Angel, given his
uncomfortable proximity to the Slayer.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.840
He looked comfortable to me.

09:46.129 --> 09:49.220
When I saw this story,
it rang chillingly familiar.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.500
So I reacquainted myself with facts.

09:52.730 --> 09:55.990
Confirming, I' m sorry to say,
my grim suspicions.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.950
In the 1700s, it was Angelus'
custom to sign his victims...

10:00.529 --> 10:03.370
...by carving a Christian cross
into their left cheek...

10:07.730 --> 10:09.940
...to let people know he'd been there.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.730
Okay. You get to leave now.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.190
You're not gonna accuse Angel
like this.

10:16.730 --> 10:17.570
- Cordelia--
- No!

10:17.929 --> 10:20.600
I don't care how many files
you have on the things...

10:20.929 --> 10:23.419
...he did back in
the powdered-wig days.

10:24.529 --> 10:26.279
He is good now.  He's my friend.

10:26.929 --> 10:30.049
And nothing you can say
will make me turn on a friend.

10:30.529 --> 10:34.320
- Cordelia.  He's right.
- You stake him, I'll cut his head off.

10:36.529 --> 10:37.399
Come no closer.

10:38.330 --> 10:39.200
I won't hurt you.

10:39.529 --> 10:42.019
That what you told
Miss Third Body Found in Alley?

10:42.529 --> 10:44.320
Why should we believe you?

10:44.330 --> 10:46.539
Because I could take you
if I wanted to.

10:47.330 --> 10:48.559
We're listening.

10:51.529 --> 10:53.279
I don't remember doing these things.

10:53.929 --> 10:57.580
Not exactly the confidence-inspiring
denial I was looking for.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.120
- I've been having dreams.
- Dreams?

11:05.929 --> 11:07.299
Killing dreams.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.309
Always the same.

11:10.730 --> 11:14.210
I stalk them, toy with them,
mark them while they're alive.

11:14.929 --> 11:17.460
Before they can die from fear,
I feed on them.

11:17.929 --> 11:20.809
So you've had nightmares.
It doesn't mean you--

11:21.529 --> 11:23.700
They're not nightmares.
I've enjoyed them.

11:26.330 --> 11:27.029
Oh.

11:28.730 --> 11:33.120
You fear it may be more than dreams.
An acting-out in a hypnogogic state.

11:34.129 --> 11:36.129
- Hypno-what-gic?
- Sleepwalking.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.850
Vampires can't sleepwalk.  He steps
out the door, and he'd be in flames.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.809
Unless it were happening
in the pre-dawn hours.

11:46.730 --> 11:49.120
Which is when all
these murders took place.

11:51.529 --> 11:53.320
There's only one way to be sure.

11:54.929 --> 11:58.970
- You've got to make it tight.
- Like I need instructions from you.

12:00.330 --> 12:03.809
My glamorous life.  I make coffee
and chain the boss to the bed.

12:04.529 --> 12:06.950
- Gotta join a union.
- It's tight enough.

12:07.529 --> 12:11.460
If it turns out we're back on a liquid
lunch?  Better safe than cocktails.

12:13.529 --> 12:15.279
All we can do now is wait.

12:15.929 --> 12:16.799
Yeah.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.940
Maybe you're committing
horrible crimes in your dreams.

12:23.730 --> 12:27.139
But I don't want to stay
for your nocturnal commissions.

12:27.929 --> 12:29.440
- I understand.
- Okay.

12:29.730 --> 12:32.710
Well, pleasant--  I mean, sleep tight.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.909
That's pretty much a given.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.259
There now.  Isn't that better?

13:26.730 --> 13:27.740
Wakey-wakey.

13:28.529 --> 13:30.389
- We made it.
- Great news, sports fans.

13:30.929 --> 13:32.679
There's been another killing.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.960
Maybe not-so-great news
for the dead person...

13:36.330 --> 13:40.019
...but at least now we know
Mr. I'm So Tortured didn't do it.

13:41.730 --> 13:42.600
Yes, I did.

13:51.850 --> 13:53.710
There now.  Isn't that better?

13:56.049 --> 13:57.309
Better.

14:00.250 --> 14:03.059
First kill.  Aptly done.

14:04.450 --> 14:08.279
- Strange.  She was my sister.
- Yet you feel nothing.

14:08.649 --> 14:09.659
No.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.870
- I feel hungry.
- You do learn quickly.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.309
And my father would disagree.

14:15.850 --> 14:19.470
It's time you shared with him
what a fine student you've become.

14:20.649 --> 14:21.809
My father.  Yes.

14:23.649 --> 14:26.320
- They'll be eating dinner.
- A feast!  Excellent.

14:26.649 --> 14:29.950
When you're invited, savor it, Penn.
You won't recapture it.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.919
Family blood is always the sweetest.

14:53.649 --> 14:56.320
- I taught him well.
- A real Psycho Wan Kenobi.

14:56.649 --> 15:00.019
Two hundred years' practice.
I imagine he's got it down by now.

15:00.850 --> 15:04.919
Gallagher's changed his act more times
than he has in the last two centuries.

15:05.649 --> 15:09.370
- Why is he doing the same old shtick?
- It's a classic, isn't it?

15:11.649 --> 15:14.950
Every time he smashes that watermelon
with the sledgehammer--

15:18.850 --> 15:19.720
I don't know why.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.470
You suppose he's trying
to draw you out?

15:23.049 --> 15:26.139
That he knows you're here?
That might explain the dreams.

15:26.649 --> 15:29.629
I have a connection with those I sire.
It means he's close.

15:30.250 --> 15:34.220
Neat.  We can't find him and the cops
stand zero chance of stopping him.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.419
- Kate.
- What are you doing?

15:38.649 --> 15:42.409
- She's no idea what she's up against.
- You're not going to tell her.

15:44.049 --> 15:47.559
You can't walk into a precinct
with knowledge of these murders...

15:48.250 --> 15:51.159
...and claim a 200-year-old
Puritan's responsible.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.759
You'd be locked up faster
than Lady Hamilton's virtue.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.409
- My apologies.
- I don't know what that meant.

16:00.850 --> 16:03.059
She's good.
She has resources we don't.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.210
- Eventually, she'll find him.
- Bad for her.

16:08.049 --> 16:09.450
Or good for us.

16:25.649 --> 16:26.809
Hey.

16:28.049 --> 16:30.190
I have the info on your license plate.

16:31.649 --> 16:32.519
Are you okay?

16:32.850 --> 16:37.029
Not that the "brooding man of mystery"
thing doesn't work.  It does.  A lot.

16:38.850 --> 16:42.750
- Can we talk somewhere in private?
- Sure.  Of course.

16:46.649 --> 16:47.840
What is it?

16:59.250 --> 17:02.549
- How's the investigation?
- It's nowhere.

17:03.450 --> 17:07.240
Some inconsiderate serial killers
often fail to leave us any clues.

17:21.450 --> 17:23.660
- He's reliving it.
- What's going on?

17:27.450 --> 17:29.380
- It's complicated.
- So make it simple.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.910
- Kate, do you trust me?
- You know I do.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.640
Trust me when I tell you
this is the man you're looking for.

17:43.049 --> 17:45.329
- Where did you get that?
- Do you trust me?

17:46.650 --> 17:49.180
I don't get it.
Are you protecting a source?

17:51.450 --> 17:52.680
Yes.  I trust you.

17:53.250 --> 17:57.180
His next victim will be a teen white
male from a low-rent neighborhood.

17:57.450 --> 18:00.430
Probably near a bar or a liquor store.
He'll kill him...

18:01.049 --> 18:04.630
...unless you use every resource
to make sure he's not successful.

18:23.849 --> 18:27.009
- You told her everything?
- Just enough to get her killed.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.410
We'll make sure that won't happen.

18:29.849 --> 18:32.829
Once you hook this up,
she finds something, we'll know.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.380
- Where'd you get the radio?
- Police car.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.180
Oh, dear.

18:39.450 --> 18:41.240
Let's add patrols here and here.

18:41.849 --> 18:44.240
Anything matching
the profile gets reported.

18:44.849 --> 18:46.849
Okay.  Mitchell, you'll ride with me.

18:53.529 --> 18:55.109
Could you buy me some beer?

18:55.329 --> 18:57.359
- Take a hike.
- I left my I.D. at home--

18:58.930 --> 18:59.910
Wipe.

19:10.329 --> 19:14.019
Ma'am, can you possibly pick me up
some beer? It's for my mother.

19:19.930 --> 19:22.180
Are you old enough to buy beer?

19:40.329 --> 19:43.589
You sure about this?  There's no
discount liquor store here.

19:44.529 --> 19:48.599
- You remind me of a brother I had.
- Whatever.  We're going nowhere here.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.240
You!  Right there!

20:08.529 --> 20:11.299
All units, backup requested
at 3336 Channel Avenue,

20:12.130 --> 20:15.079
Use caution, homicide suspect
believed to be at location,

20:22.930 --> 20:24.680
Search teams are on their way.

20:25.329 --> 20:28.519
He went in through there.
Exits are sealed.  We'll find him.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.579
- Watch your backs.
- We got him.

20:32.529 --> 20:33.859
I'm going in.

20:51.730 --> 20:53.059
Meet you back here.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.890
Don't move!
Do not move.  I will fire!

22:03.130 --> 22:04.000
Ouch.

22:19.329 --> 22:20.730
Angelus?

22:23.529 --> 22:25.140
Angelus.

22:26.529 --> 22:29.759
- My God.  It's been a lifetime.
- At least.

22:30.130 --> 22:32.450
- We were to meet in Italy.
- I remember.

22:33.130 --> 22:36.109
Hell, I waited till the 19th century.
What happened?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.819
- Got held up in Romania.
- Romania?

22:40.329 --> 22:41.869
- What's in Romania?
- Gypsies.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.950
- Request assistance.
- Join me for a drink.

22:48.130 --> 22:52.309
- That's not why I'm here.
- Request assistance.  Suspect sighted.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.369
Yes. Why are you here?

22:55.930 --> 22:58.250
- To kill you.
- Detective Lockley,

23:28.930 --> 23:31.029
Go, Kate!  Get out of here!  Go!

23:35.529 --> 23:38.720
You know its name?
Angelus, what's happened to you?

23:40.930 --> 23:42.890
- People change.
- We're not people.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.900
Where are you?

24:06.890 --> 24:08.079
I shot him three times.

24:08.690 --> 24:09.950
I know I did.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.609
Then he got up.

24:13.490 --> 24:15.740
If I pull this trigger,
will you get up too?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.690
- What are you?
- You know the answer.

24:24.890 --> 24:27.210
A detail's been left out
of the press reports.

24:27.890 --> 24:30.420
Something you've held back.
Isn't that right?

24:30.890 --> 24:32.680
- What do you know?
- The puncture wounds.

24:35.089 --> 24:37.720
The victims were all drained
of their blood, right?

24:39.289 --> 24:41.009
Should I trust you more or less now?

24:42.289 --> 24:44.539
- You're not gonna stop him.
- What do you mean?

24:44.690 --> 24:48.059
It'll take sunlight, decapitation,
or a stake through the heart.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.819
- Children's stories.
- It's the truth.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.039
No.  I don't believe you.

24:53.690 --> 24:56.880
Even after what you saw, you won't
let yourself.  So you'll lose.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.029
- I've heard enough.
- You haven't heard a word.

25:00.289 --> 25:02.569
And you won't. Not now, not yet.

25:06.289 --> 25:09.130
Because there are some things
you're not ready to face.

25:26.690 --> 25:30.019
Here's everything with the M.O.,
dating back as far as I could find.

25:30.890 --> 25:31.759
Thanks, Chris.

25:32.089 --> 25:34.859
So you think this guy's a copycat,
a history buff?

25:35.089 --> 25:36.559
Something like that.

25:48.890 --> 25:52.680
So you've discovered the seamy
underbelly of a candy-coated America.

25:53.690 --> 25:56.990
Well, you've come to the right place.
Here at Angel Investigations...

25:57.890 --> 25:59.680
...we won't judge, but we will charge.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.339
Tell me how you heard of us.

26:02.089 --> 26:03.490
- From the police.
- Really?

26:03.890 --> 26:06.980
Yes.  The detective I spoke with
was very enthusiastic.

26:08.089 --> 26:11.710
For the truly human touch,
she said that I should come to you.

26:12.289 --> 26:13.549
Oh, good.

26:18.890 --> 26:19.759
Is it cold out?

26:20.089 --> 26:22.339
I'm trying to remember her name.
What was it?

26:23.089 --> 26:25.579
She's about yea tall,
attractive, natural blond.

26:26.089 --> 26:28.759
- Oh, yeah, Kate.  Detective Lockley.
- Lockley.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.759
Yes, that's it.

26:32.089 --> 26:33.599
She and Angel are tight.

26:34.490 --> 26:36.309
Really?  So this is more...

26:36.289 --> 26:39.029
...than just a professional
relationship?  He cares for her.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.140
Yeah.  More than he knows.
But that's our Angel...

26:42.890 --> 26:45.660
...dour, but not afraid to get
personally involved in his work...

26:45.890 --> 26:48.420
...and you're pumping me
for information, aren't you?

26:49.490 --> 26:52.160
Oh, crap.  You're him.  He.  The guy.

26:53.690 --> 26:54.670
Apt pupil boy.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.160
You realize you'll never make it
to the exit before I--

26:58.490 --> 26:59.470
Go up like a match?

27:03.890 --> 27:05.009
Well....

27:08.690 --> 27:10.789
He's back from his
Up with People meeting.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.839
- Get me a stake.
- It's 8 in the morning.

27:14.690 --> 27:16.200
Oh, you mean like-- Okay.

27:20.089 --> 27:22.690
What? You don't drink,
so now no one gets to?

27:23.690 --> 27:25.509
I don't expect you to understand.

27:26.089 --> 27:29.069
I understand.
I was a Puritan, remember?

27:29.690 --> 27:32.250
- It's gotta end.
- Why? Because you say so?

27:33.890 --> 27:35.710
Yeah, how does that work, exactly?

27:36.289 --> 27:39.029
You wake up one morning
and decide, "Okay, now I'm good!"

27:41.690 --> 27:44.500
No, Angelus.  It doesn't end.
It never ever ends.

27:44.690 --> 27:45.769
It just goes on and on.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.049
That's not the only thing
that goes on and on.

27:50.089 --> 27:51.099
Here.  Dust him.

27:51.289 --> 27:52.900
I'm sorry what I turned you into.

27:53.690 --> 27:55.269
A first-class killer?

27:56.089 --> 27:58.720
An artist?
A bold reinterpreter of the form?

27:59.089 --> 27:59.960
Try "cheesy hack."

28:00.890 --> 28:03.869
You've been getting back at
your father for over 200 years.

28:05.089 --> 28:08.710
It's pathetic.  You've probably
got a killer's shrine on your wall.

28:09.289 --> 28:12.309
News clippings, magazine articles,
maybe a few candles.

28:13.490 --> 28:16.049
Oh, you are so prosaic.

28:17.690 --> 28:19.410
Nothing about a new vampire in town--

28:22.490 --> 28:25.329
Maybe because he's here
and has me by the throat.

28:25.490 --> 28:26.789
- Let him go.
- You're right.

28:27.890 --> 28:31.220
My work was getting stale.
I appreciate the critique.

28:32.089 --> 28:36.369
So look for something new, innovative.
Something shockingly original.

28:37.490 --> 28:41.630
Think of the worst possible thing you
can imagine, and I'll see you there.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.170
Hi.  Can I come in?

30:04.609 --> 30:06.779
Oh, that's right,
you have to be invited in.

30:09.410 --> 30:12.500
- You've been doing your homework.
- Quiz me.  I'm full of fun facts.

30:13.009 --> 30:15.500
Your friend was in L.A. before.
Did you know that?

30:16.609 --> 30:17.910
Yeah.  At least twice.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.089
Once in 1929 and again in 1963.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.460
Oh, and there was something
in Boston in 19O8.

30:23.210 --> 30:24.440
I think he was there too.

30:25.009 --> 30:27.109
- So you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you.

30:27.410 --> 30:28.950
- He's planning--
- Angelus.

30:30.410 --> 30:31.990
Isn't that what he called you?

30:33.410 --> 30:35.269
I looked it up.  It's all right there.

30:35.809 --> 30:37.630
The demon with the face of an angel.

30:37.609 --> 30:40.240
A particularly brutal bastard
by all accounts.

30:41.210 --> 30:44.019
- And, no, you can't come in.
- I can't make up for the past.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.599
No, you can't.
In fact, what's happening now...

30:47.210 --> 30:48.509
...is really because of you.

30:49.009 --> 30:50.380
You made him, didn't you?

30:51.410 --> 30:52.710
Let me help end it, please.

30:53.809 --> 30:57.809
"Please."  There's a word I imagine
you heard a lot of in your time.

30:58.609 --> 31:01.450
Please.  No.  Don't.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.569
Thanks, but I don't need your help.

31:04.009 --> 31:07.029
I know what to do.
Drive a stake right through his heart.

31:08.210 --> 31:10.630
When that happens,
I suggest you don't be there...

31:11.210 --> 31:12.789
...because I'll do the same to you.

31:18.329 --> 31:21.349
Here it is. Los Angeles Globe, 1929.

31:24.930 --> 31:28.579
"The suspect seemed like a quiet,
normal type.  The search is ongoing."

31:29.130 --> 31:32.539
- What are we looking for exactly?
- I don't know yet.

31:33.930 --> 31:35.859
"In 1963, police tracked the killer...

31:36.329 --> 31:39.309
...to a residential hotel
called the Cloverwood Apartments.

31:39.930 --> 31:42.630
By the time they made their move,
he'd already fled."

31:43.529 --> 31:45.109
They never caught him.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.930
It's the same place.
New name and a face-lift.

31:57.329 --> 32:01.119
- That's happened before in this town.
- Good old predictable Penn.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.089
- I invite you in.
- That's only for humans.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.799
Breaking and entering
a vampire's lair isn't a problem.

32:17.730 --> 32:18.849
Right.

32:22.529 --> 32:23.789
He's not here.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.430
So then we wait?
Raid the icebox and try to think...

32:30.329 --> 32:32.579
...of the worst possible
thing we can imagine?

32:36.329 --> 32:37.799
Stop imagining.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.460
Good Lord.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.609
All those schoolchildren.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.750
He's finally changing his act.

33:03.970 --> 33:05.619
All right, listen up.

33:06.369 --> 33:08.089
You've all received one of these.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.380
This is the man we're looking for.

33:11.170 --> 33:13.910
And this man is how
we're going to find him.

33:14.769 --> 33:17.049
His name is Angel.
He's a private detective.

33:17.170 --> 33:19.200
Our suspect may make an attempt...

33:19.569 --> 33:21.710
...to contact Angel,
possibly as his next target.

33:22.569 --> 33:24.220
So we'll stake out Angel's place.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.599
How many men do you want?

33:26.170 --> 33:30.309
- Lots.  We'll work in rotating teams--
- This is a terrible likeness.

33:32.769 --> 33:34.210
The mouth.  It's all wrong.

33:35.769 --> 33:36.640
No!

33:51.970 --> 33:53.089
Attention, all units....

33:53.769 --> 33:54.890
We're in.

33:55.569 --> 33:58.240
What about the schoolchildren?
Shouldn't we be--?

33:58.569 --> 33:59.549
Stop!  Stop!

34:01.569 --> 34:02.759
Hold it right there.

34:09.369 --> 34:10.530
He's here.

34:11.768 --> 34:15.320
Twelfth Street Station House,
Secure area, use caution,

34:36.369 --> 34:38.900
- What are you gonna do?
- I thought I'd stop everything...

34:39.969 --> 34:42.389
...and tell you my plan.
But better yet...

34:47.170 --> 34:48.849
...why don't I just show you?

34:59.769 --> 35:02.119
Smell that fear.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.000
It makes the blood sweeter.

35:06.369 --> 35:08.929
- You know who taught me that?
- I'm not afraid to die.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.730
Oh, I'm not going to kill you.
But when I'm finished, Angel will.

35:14.769 --> 35:16.869
A bus full of schoolchildren, Penn?

35:17.170 --> 35:19.269
You really thought
I was gonna fall for that?

35:20.769 --> 35:23.050
- Well, you could have.
- No.  Too original.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.929
You were right
about one thing, Angelus.

35:33.369 --> 35:36.280
The last 200 years has been
about me sticking it to my father.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.300
But I've come to realize something.
It's you.

35:42.969 --> 35:44.130
You made me!

35:44.170 --> 35:45.429
You taught me!

35:55.570 --> 35:58.480
You approved of me in ways
my mortal father never did!

35:59.170 --> 36:01.269
- You're my real father, Angelus.
- Fine!

36:04.570 --> 36:05.619
You're grounded.

36:39.369 --> 36:41.190
You forget your own lessons, teacher.

36:41.769 --> 36:43.909
Never give up the advantage, remember?

36:44.769 --> 36:47.119
Living among them has made you weak!

36:48.369 --> 36:50.619
It sickens me to think
that there was a time...

36:51.369 --> 36:53.369
...you would've done whatever
was necessary.

37:11.769 --> 37:13.380
- You missed.
- No, I didn't.

37:47.489 --> 37:49.809
This vein on my temple
is doing the cha-cha...

37:50.489 --> 37:52.139
...because I just had one of those...

37:52.289 --> 37:54.750
...bone-crunching, mind-splitting
vision headaches.

37:59.489 --> 38:00.719
New job.

38:04.289 --> 38:06.780
This place is like where I grew up.

38:09.090 --> 38:10.210
Right.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.190
Yeah, I could see that...

38:12.690 --> 38:16.659
...except for the cars, the buildings
and the, you know, everything else.

38:16.889 --> 38:18.400
It's not so different.

38:19.289 --> 38:21.360
People moving through their lives.

38:22.289 --> 38:23.800
I wonder if anything changes.

38:24.690 --> 38:26.059
Sure it does.

38:26.489 --> 38:28.980
They do. You have.

38:31.289 --> 38:32.480
They were just dreams.

38:32.489 --> 38:34.980
They weren't even yours.
It didn't mean anything.

38:36.090 --> 38:37.320
But I enjoyed it.

38:37.289 --> 38:40.590
It'd probably be okay if you never
mentioned that part ever again.

38:41.489 --> 38:42.789
It's still in me.

38:43.289 --> 38:45.610
Sure it's in you.
We all have something.

38:46.289 --> 38:48.150
But it's not the only thing
that's in you.

38:48.090 --> 38:50.369
You're not him, Angel.  Not anymore.

38:51.690 --> 38:53.019
The name I got in my vision--

38:54.090 --> 38:57.570
The message didn't come for Angelus.

38:58.289 --> 39:01.199
And you have to trust that whoever
The Powers That Be, be--

39:01.889 --> 39:03.920
Are.  Is.

39:04.889 --> 39:07.659

39:10.289 --> 39:12.750

39:13.289 --> 39:14.230

39:18.090 --> 39:20.090
And sometimes they change back.

39:21.090 --> 39:23.550
- If the day ever comes that I--
- Oh, I'll kill you.

39:24.690 --> 39:25.699
Thanks.
