Please!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.418
It's a military-themed party,

00:27.462 --> 00:29.420
and I don't have anything
this ugly.
I said no.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.074
And why are those Greek
parties always themed?

00:31.118 --> 00:33.381
Have you thought about
that, psychologically,

00:33.424 --> 00:35.078
that they're always
pretending to be other people?

00:35.122 --> 00:36.732
No, because I actually like
to have fun.

Professor Thaine is protesting
his suspension.

00:50.224 --> 00:53.401

can't testify...

Are you okay, Mom?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.537
Yeah.

Okay. Did you have a glass
of wine or something, Mom?

01:13.508 --> 01:15.423
No.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.642
One. Come here.

01:22.604 --> 01:25.911
I feel so lucky

01:25.955 --> 01:28.610

Special in such

01:31.569 --> 01:34.181

01:34.224 --> 01:37.140
Always remember that.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.229
You're better together.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.536
Your differences
are your strengths.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.626
And nothing is stronger
than your sisterhood.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.412
Nurture that.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.501
Don't worry, Mom.
We are all over it.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.590
Yeah, we're gonna nurture it
so hard.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.071
But later. Can we go?

it's over.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.213

is in a coma.

she said" situation.

a teaching assistant.

You're losing it.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.094

11:02.226 --> 11:04.489
You're rushing that sorority?

11:04.533 --> 11:05.490
Yeah. I have been.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.927
All month.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.276

11:08.319 --> 11:10.278
A sister.

11:10.321 --> 11:13.107
That's just what
it's called. Anyway...Wow.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.086
Mel, look at this.Oh.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.652
I saw. Where'd
you get it?

12:20.696 --> 12:22.654
I found it after my dad died.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.309
I just got a job
at the university.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.007
I was walking by
and saw your house.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.444

12:29.487 --> 12:30.924
you just happen
to drive by?She wasn't murdered. Stop it.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.839
What do you want?I don't want anything.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.014
Because we don't
have any money.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.972
Mel.Money? I don't want money.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.147
Then why are you here?Because I just

12:37.191 --> 12:39.628
found out, and I thought
maybe you would...

12:42.022 --> 12:43.632
Whatever.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.069
It was clearly a mistake.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.642
But why not try again?Because I'm not begging.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.210
I've been fine on my own.
I like being on my own.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.994
Then why'd you go there?

12:58.038 --> 12:59.474
Curiosity.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.128
That's an
Internet search.

13:01.171 --> 13:05.262
Look, I-I know we don't
know each other that well.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.047
Yet.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.832
But you didn't e-mail,
you didn't call.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.921
You just went over there. Why?

13:11.965 --> 13:14.750
I guess I wanted
to ask 'em about my mom.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.012
Well, what did your dad
have to say about it?

13:16.056 --> 13:19.320
That she died, when I was two.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.843
Obviously, he... he lied.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.932
All the more reason
to go back over there.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.281
No.Look, they
were shocked.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.892
I bet if you try it again...No, I'm done.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.894
Come on.
Enough, okay?

13:30.026 --> 13:31.593
What the hell?

13:31.636 --> 13:33.682
I-I am so sorry.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.946
I am drunk and clumsy.
I sh... I should go.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.343
♪

13:42.386 --> 13:44.954
What else can I tell you?

13:44.998 --> 13:48.479
Oh, we have maid service
every week, 'cause trust me,

13:48.523 --> 13:51.874
girls are just as gross as boys.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.311
But Kappa is not
just about the perks.

13:54.355 --> 13:57.967
We also give back.
That's right: Kappa is woke.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.318
We volunteer at
Hilltowne Memorial.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.451
Some of the sisters
have been sitting vigil

14:03.494 --> 14:06.802
with poor Angela Wu,
even though she is not Greek.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.021
So sad.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.110
Is she gonna regain
brain function?

14:10.153 --> 14:14.810
No. But not for a lack of effort
on our part.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.899
Yeah.

14:16.943 --> 14:20.250
Anyway, you should all
be so, so, so, so proud

14:20.294 --> 14:23.036
to have made it to
this final round.

14:23.079 --> 14:26.735
So go and enjoy some apps,
and good luck.

14:26.778 --> 14:30.608
I like your... your top.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.088
Maggie? Maggie.

14:32.132 --> 14:36.397
Um, between you and me,
you're a shoo-in.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.920
Really?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.879
Unless you, like,
poop in a vase,

14:39.922 --> 14:42.011
or space out
on your phone again.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.534
I'm just kidding.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.449
Oh, Viv, Dylan.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
I don't think
that you've met Maggie.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.671
Hi.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.194
DYLAN: Maggie?

14:51.238 --> 14:52.674
Didn't she used to work
in the dining hall?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.938
Oh, um, yeah, yeah.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.027
I-I worked at the dining
hall last semester.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.029
I'm at Silvio's
Trattoria now?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.335
We don't need your résumé.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.598
Great skirt. Where'd you get it

15:03.641 --> 15:05.121
VIV:
Her mom just died.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.644
I should be nice.

15:06.688 --> 15:10.997
Uh, is this
some kind of rush prank?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.346
Maggie, what is going on?

15:12.389 --> 15:13.303
Rush prank?

15:13.347 --> 15:15.305
I'm sorry.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.654
I have to go.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.656
Maggie?

15:18.700 --> 15:20.832
GIRL: Ugh, I'm so bloated.

15:20.876 --> 15:23.052
GIRL 2: I hate these bitches.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.662
GIRL 3:
Where's the mini quiches?GIRL 4: Where's the guy

15:24.706 --> 15:25.968
with the mini quiches

15:26.012 --> 15:28.014
Are you okay

15:28.057 --> 15:29.450
LUCY:
We may have to get rid of her.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.236
I mean, if someone
just showed up at your house,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.673
claiming to be your sister,
would you believe them?

15:35.717 --> 15:38.459
Mel, you need to breathe.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.853
Oh. Is it that kind
of coffee date?

15:41.897 --> 15:44.769
No. It's an "I'm worried
about you" coffee date.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.336
You seem like
you're unraveling.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.687
Well, good thing I'm not
your problem anymore.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.385
I still care about you.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.996
Then dumping me after my mom
died was an interesting choice.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.302
That's not fair.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.613
I am so, so sorry about that.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.093
All good.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.356
Did you see that?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.185
The coffee?

16:14.582 --> 16:16.888
Oh, my God.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.674
What is happening?

16:19.717 --> 16:21.676
What about the coffee?

16:27.464 --> 16:30.076
Please. Stop.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.036
What is going on?

16:38.693 --> 16:39.563
I have to go.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.783
You were right. I am not okay.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.525
I am not.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.148
What the...?

16:59.192 --> 17:00.671
Hello, ladies.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.764
Don't, don't worry.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.334
There is a reasonable
explanation.

17:11.378 --> 17:14.598
You are witches.

17:14.642 --> 17:19.734
Witches who are destined to save
the world from impending doom.

17:24.739 --> 17:28.221
That's right.
You are the Charmed Ones.

17:28.264 --> 17:34.183
The most powerful trio
of witches.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.706
He's the new
women's studies chair.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.925
I knew something
was off about him.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.840
Well, that
is unnecessarily rude.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.494
But I'll let it go
because I know this is a lot.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.192
Untie us right now, or else...No "or else" necessary.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.064
Let me get those for you.
I know, it's all so extreme

17:45.107 --> 17:46.543
with the grabbing
and the binding.

17:46.587 --> 17:50.460
Believe me, I'd love to have
just sent out a group text.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.114
There we are.

17:52.158 --> 17:55.117
This isn't happening.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.118
Girls.MEL:
So I'm not crazy.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.119
I thought I was going crazy.Girls.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.425
All of this is crazy.Girls.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.253
MAGGIE:
I am not a witch.
Girls.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.950
I don't even like wearing witch
costumes on Halloween, like,Girls.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.778
not even slutty ones.Girls!

18:05.084 --> 18:06.998
Sorry. Ladies.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.827
Now, we all saw what Macy
did with the globe.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.394
Looks like we've got
telekinesis.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.874
Telekinesis is not a thing.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.223
Then again, it did
fly across the room...

18:14.267 --> 18:15.659
And there has to be
a scientific explanation.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.967
Uh, yes, there is, it's called
molecular witch-etics.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.011
You're not funny.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.796
Particle witch

18:21.839 --> 18:23.145
All right, what--
all right, what are you doing?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.973
Trying to freeze time.Oh.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.540
Is that yourpower?
Oh, well, makes sense.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.063
Very common with control freaks.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.586
So why isn't it working?It's a craft.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.066
Witchcraft.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.154
Which means
you have to figure out

18:32.198 --> 18:34.113
how to access
and control it.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.812
Well, looks like you've
already mastered yours.

18:37.855 --> 18:41.163
Bravo. Must be that
impressively high IQ.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.643
So this means I really was
reading minds?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.166
A testament

18:44.210 --> 18:46.821
to your innate sensitivity,
or desperate insecurity.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.562
They're two sides of the coin,
really. Not to worry.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.390
I will help you
understand it all.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.175
You see,
I am an advisor to witches.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.918
They call me a Whitelighter.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.573
Physically, I died in 1957.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.792
Wait. Was Mom a witch?

19:01.836 --> 19:03.707
Bingo.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.970
And part of my speech.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.973
Your mother was a witch.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.758
A very powerful one.

19:10.801 --> 19:14.153
She bound your powers when you
each were born to protect you

19:14.196 --> 19:15.980
and let you live normal lives.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.200
Now, she was in
the process of unbinding

19:18.244 --> 19:21.072
those powers...

19:21.116 --> 19:24.119
the night she was murdered.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.383
I knew it.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.255
I knew she didn't fall.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.779
Who killed her?

19:31.822 --> 19:33.998
We don't know, as yet.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.609
There was ice
at the scene,

19:35.652 --> 19:37.219
so cold is a characteristic,

19:37.263 --> 19:38.525
but there are literally
thousands of different demons

19:38.568 --> 19:39.830
associated with cold.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.267
What are you even talking about?

19:41.310 --> 19:42.572
It's all here.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.055
The Book of Shadows.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.926
The Ancient Oracles
predicted

19:48.970 --> 19:50.624
three signs of apocalypse.

19:50.667 --> 19:56.151
The first, "When the weakest of
men reaches ill-gotten glory,

19:56.195 --> 19:57.848
and," oh, God,
this goes on and on.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.502
The language is far
too flowery for my taste.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.939
but suffice to say,
it's your current president.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.811
Can we go back to the part
where you said "apocalypse"?

20:03.854 --> 20:05.813
Not really,
I'm in a rhythm here.

20:05.856 --> 20:10.121
The second sign, "The movement's
great sages fall,"

20:10.165 --> 20:11.862
well, that refers
to your mother's death

20:11.906 --> 20:13.603
and the senior witches
who have been killed since.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.779
Other witches?
How many are there?

20:15.823 --> 20:19.957
Really, this works
much better as a monologue,

20:20.001 --> 20:21.611
if you don't mind.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.135
The final sign
hasn't happened yet.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.747
"With the blossoming of death

20:26.790 --> 20:30.403
"comes the awakening
of the Source of All Evil.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.840
And then, we fall."

20:32.883 --> 20:34.276
Well, so, you can see
why we finished what

20:34.320 --> 20:37.236
your mother started that night,
and brought you here.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.412
She wanted me here?

20:39.455 --> 20:41.979
Yes. Very much.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.242
She sent you the grant
application,

20:43.285 --> 20:44.808
made sure it was chosen.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.245
MAGGIE:
See?

20:46.288 --> 20:47.811
She isour sister.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.248
So,

20:49.291 --> 20:51.075
your mother's spell book.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.078
Keep it safe.

20:54.122 --> 20:57.908
Your guide to using the Power
of Three to protect the innocent

20:57.952 --> 20:59.823
and vanquish demons.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.261
You three have
48 hours to decide

21:02.304 --> 21:03.871
whether you wish
to accept your witchly fate.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.177
We get to decide?Oh, yes.

21:06.221 --> 21:09.311
Being a witch is a fully
pro-choice enterprise.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.313
And the decision
must be unanimous.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.315
If you refuse,

21:13.359 --> 21:16.971
everything since made possible
by magical intervention...

21:17.014 --> 21:19.713
will be undone.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.585
You guys, this demon
harvests witches' organs

21:22.629 --> 21:24.326
for freaking smoothies!

21:24.370 --> 21:25.545
Don't worry,
the underworld doesn't know

21:25.588 --> 21:26.807
your powers have been awakened.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.293
No way. I'm not doing this.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.338
I do not want to
end up in a smoothie.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.470
Maggie, this is our legacy.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.993
Mom wanted us to do this,

21:39.036 --> 21:40.342
and now we can figure out
who killed her.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.343
I'll, uh,

21:41.387 --> 21:42.692
I'll let you three hash it out.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.215
If you need me, call.

21:44.259 --> 21:48.002
Or, uh, text, Snap,
or Twitter DM.

21:49.525 --> 21:53.355
Well, or just call my name
and I'll magically appear.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.491
I just wanted to show you
the effect.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.841
They prefer I get around

22:00.884 --> 22:03.409
like a regular person now...
to blend in.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.893
It's a folie a deux.
It must be.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.155
He induced it somehow.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.287
You did just see that guy

22:12.331 --> 22:13.810
disappear into thin air, right?

22:13.854 --> 22:16.073
You think us actually
being witches makes more sense?

22:16.117 --> 22:21.165
Yeah, I do.
It all... makes sense.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.906
Throughout history, strong women
were called witches,

22:22.950 --> 22:26.040
and they are... we are.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.085
We have to unite
to change the power dynamics,

22:28.129 --> 22:30.914
right the ship, change
the course of humanity.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.486
It's Lucy. She wants me
to go to the Kappa house.

22:37.530 --> 22:38.705
Seriously, no interest

22:38.748 --> 22:40.489
in changing the course
of humanity?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.317
Witches aren't real.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.580
There's a scientific
explanation for this.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.039
Of course I'm relieved.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.172
I mean, justice was served.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.740
This was a witch hunt.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.051
WhatI was worried.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.444
You just ran out.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.186
Oh, right, um,
I'm-I'm sorry.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.187
Are you okay?

23:26.230 --> 23:27.580
You know what?

23:27.623 --> 23:29.408
I feel better.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.453
And I am sorry about
what I said.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.847
About you ending things
after my mom died.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.588
I know I shut you out.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.288
You were just so angry.
Yeah.

23:40.331 --> 23:43.422
That's what my sister
says, too.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.730
Are you really...

23:51.430 --> 23:53.170
Niko?

23:58.393 --> 23:59.612
...okay?

23:59.655 --> 24:02.049
Yes.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.444
Yes, I'm okay.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.923
I wanted...

24:06.967 --> 24:08.447
Niko?

24:11.362 --> 24:13.016
Oh, my God!

24:14.278 --> 24:16.498
Okay, I got this.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.546
...to be there for you,

24:20.589 --> 24:22.330
but the anger
just got in the way.

24:22.373 --> 24:25.420
Exactly, the anger
got in the way.

24:25.464 --> 24:29.729
Wow, you really do
seem better.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.340
I feel better.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.820
Like I've come out of a fog.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.474
I've missed you.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.437
Is your sister home?Mm-mm.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.373
MAGGIE:
Hi there.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.244
Are you lost?

25:16.602 --> 25:19.213
Mel
A frikking demon dog

25:19.256 --> 25:20.867
just tried to eat
my hair extensions.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.304
And had crazy eyes
and-and green goo.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.262
And the only reason
I got away was because

25:25.306 --> 25:26.829
this group of drunk guys
showed up and--

25:26.873 --> 25:29.223
Shh, shh, shh...

25:29.266 --> 25:31.225
Don't shush me.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.488
Did you not hear me say
a demon dog?

25:35.359 --> 25:38.667
Sorority initiation thing.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.063
MAGGIE:
So just clarify.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.195
Ex sex, or are you and Niko
back together?

25:45.239 --> 25:46.632
Priorities.
Shh.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.024
So, what do you think?

25:48.068 --> 25:50.244
I think I've never seen
anything like this before.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.376
Yeah, pretty sure that's because
it's supernatural ooze.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.683
But it seems to be surrounding
a non-supernatural cell.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.206
Some kind of hydrochloric acid.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.861
Well, there are about 1,000
demon dogs in this book.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.167
It could take hours
to find the spell.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.604
Are you seriously
being serious?

26:02.648 --> 26:04.258
I just barely
got away from that thing.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.173
I'm not interested
in hunting it down.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.783
What other choice
do we have?

26:07.827 --> 26:10.003
Um, we choose not to be witches,

26:10.046 --> 26:12.048
we avoid demon dogs
till tomorrow,

26:12.092 --> 26:13.833
and everything goes
back to normal.Baking soda.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.052
I need baking soda.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.186
Why didn't you summon me?

26:19.229 --> 26:21.362
I told you if you needed me
to text.
Stop talking,
I have a question.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.277
Is this gonna scar?

26:27.237 --> 26:28.369
Good news,

26:28.412 --> 26:30.371
I'm a healer, no scar.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.068
Bad news, looks like
something in the underworld

26:32.112 --> 26:34.375
knows you three had
your powers activated.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.942
I was wrong.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.770
If you're wrong, what's
the point of calling you?

26:37.813 --> 26:39.075
A paradox for another day.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.469
Here's what I can tell you.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.950
A demon dog always comes
with a demon owner.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.778
Typically,
a possessed human.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.214
That's who we've got to find.

26:47.257 --> 26:50.043
Now, did anyone know
where you were going

26:50.086 --> 26:51.305
before you were attacked?

26:51.348 --> 26:53.612
Just Lucy,
the president of Kappa.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.268
And I heard her thoughts say
she had to get rid of me.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.879
I-I thought she meant
cut me from rush.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.011
Of course it's her.
So, what now?

27:02.055 --> 27:04.448
Is there, like, a spell
to defeat her?Oh, yes, of course.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.754
Somewhere in that
2,000-page book,

27:05.798 --> 27:08.365
or, uh, "tome,"
I should say.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.759
So, let's get reading.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.283
Or, use sodium bicarbonate.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.676
Look.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.419
Oh!
Like I said,

27:18.462 --> 27:20.943
some kind of hydrochloric
acid compound.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.990
So sodium bicarbonate
neutralizes it.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.906
Oh, well, saves
a lot of time.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.516
Right on. So let's
go get rid of Lucy.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.257
Stop. We can't just get rid of
the president of Kappa.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.563
We can, if she's a demon
who killed our mother.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.870
Well, what if she's not,
and you makes some crazy scene?

27:34.914 --> 27:36.002
Guys?Are you seriously scared

27:36.045 --> 27:37.438
about ruining rush?

27:37.481 --> 27:39.353
Yeah, I am.
I can't believe this.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.095
I'm sorry I want a life
when this is over.With them?

27:42.138 --> 27:43.313
Yeah, with them.Why?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.838
Because they don't
blame me for Mom's death.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.016
I get it.

27:50.059 --> 27:53.367
You think if I'd answered
my phone,

27:53.410 --> 27:55.151
you would have
gotten here in time.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.936
Well, I can assure you

27:56.979 --> 27:59.852
I blame myself every day.

28:10.906 --> 28:14.388
Who's there?

28:19.436 --> 28:20.699
Maggie?

28:22.091 --> 28:23.092
Maggie?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.095
Welcome to Kappa.

28:26.139 --> 28:30.230
You are all now officially
a part of our sisterhood.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.492
Congratulations.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.455
Come upstairs.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.283
I have something special
for you.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.851
Maggie? Maggie!

28:54.341 --> 28:57.866
Maggie? What took you
so long in there?

28:57.910 --> 29:00.869
Maggie.Hey. Hi.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.219
Um, I'll be back.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.618
MEL: There she is.
Go find Maggie.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.493
Oh, hey, Mel.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.800
I-I'm waiting for your sister,
but since you're here...

29:18.844 --> 29:21.455
Be gone, demon!

29:21.498 --> 29:24.371
What the hell?

29:24.414 --> 29:25.459
You're not a demon?

29:25.502 --> 29:26.460
Excuse me?

29:26.503 --> 29:28.854
Um, I just mean
theoretically.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.725
I think you're
kind of bitchy.

29:32.727 --> 29:36.470
I was offering you a drank
from the secret stash

29:36.513 --> 29:39.778
because all Greek parties
are dry now since coma girl.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.605
:
Sorry.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.000
You seem so stressed.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.524
[party music playing
in next room]

29:47.568 --> 29:48.482
Is it rush?

29:48.525 --> 29:51.964
Um, yeah, you know.
Mostly.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.488
You care so much
about what people think.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.490
You know that I think
you're perfect.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.494
Can I kiss you?

30:00.537 --> 30:02.496
One last time?

30:04.454 --> 30:06.717
BRIAN:
Prepare yourself for the end.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.068
You know, I'll pass on the kiss.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.809
Too bad,
you already said yes.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.899
When it comes to consent, I can
change my mind at any time.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.554
Oh, my God, Pilates.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.128
Not so fast, Mags.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.304
Help!

30:36.182 --> 30:37.226
Oh, my God.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.576
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, is he dying?

30:39.620 --> 30:41.274
I don't know.
Is he dying?
He's not dying, right?

30:41.317 --> 30:42.710
It's just the demon?I don't know.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.549
Oh, thank God.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.161
What happened?

31:03.600 --> 31:06.821
I'm just saying,
that was a kiss.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.692
It was all the adrenaline.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.477
In fact, adrenaline
doesn't have much effect

31:10.520 --> 31:12.174
on human emotions
besides the fear response.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.784
Oh, my God, if you'd
been my sister longer,

31:13.828 --> 31:16.178
I'd tell you to shut up.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.094
He's just not who
I see myself with long-term.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.402
My God, are you for real pouting

31:22.445 --> 31:23.490
because you missed out
on the fight?

31:23.533 --> 31:25.971
I'm not pouting.
I don't pout.

31:26.014 --> 31:29.104
Impartial observer.
You pout.
Yeah.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.107
It's just I finally figured
out how to freeze things,

31:32.151 --> 31:33.848
and I was excited
to try it.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.197
So how'd you do it?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.198
Whatever.
It's not important.

31:36.242 --> 31:37.678
Come on, action, reaction.

31:37.721 --> 31:38.897
What was it?
What changed?

31:38.940 --> 31:42.944
Hmm?

31:42.988 --> 31:47.079
It works when I am not angry.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.518
Oh, my God.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.694
Your powers are judging you.

31:53.737 --> 31:56.218
Ha-ha-ha,
it's hilarious.

31:56.262 --> 31:57.828
It is.

31:57.872 --> 32:01.441
But I, uh, did
want to say...

32:01.484 --> 32:05.532
I'm sorry and I don't blame you.

32:05.575 --> 32:08.013
I blame myself.

32:08.056 --> 32:11.538
I knew something wasn't
right that night.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.584
I knew, but I still wanted
to leave the house and...

32:14.628 --> 32:18.545
Stop. It's not
your fault, either.

32:18.588 --> 32:19.981
I shouldn't have
shut you out.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.983
I am your big sister.

32:22.027 --> 32:25.726
I'm supposed to nurture
you so hard, you know?

32:27.597 --> 32:30.339
Hey, now see?

32:30.383 --> 32:32.254
This is good.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.343
You two are so much
better together.

32:34.387 --> 32:38.478
Mom said that.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.569
So what was she like?

32:42.612 --> 32:46.616
Well, lucky for you,
I am a firm believer

32:46.660 --> 32:48.618
that if it's not on camera
it didn't happen.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.842
MARISOL: Cake!MAGGIE: No, higher angle.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.191
Please. It's going on Instagram.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.540
Oh, don't be silly.
You look beautiful.

32:57.584 --> 32:58.933
I am so proud of you.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.763
I'm proud of you both.

33:08.987 --> 33:13.252
You know, when I was nine,
at a birthday party, I was...

33:13.295 --> 33:18.039
I was so sure she contacted me
through a Ouija board.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.911
Hey, maybe she did.

33:20.955 --> 33:22.435
You know,
she probably could.

33:22.478 --> 33:25.699
Yeah, maybe.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.005
You're right. She seems great.

33:28.963 --> 33:33.011
But she also left me, so...

33:34.621 --> 33:37.058
Oh, no.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.408
You were really
lonely growing up.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.282
I'm sorry.
I read your thoughts.

33:43.325 --> 33:44.283
Y-Yeah.

33:44.326 --> 33:48.026
Yeah, I-I guess sometimes I was.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.031
I definitely didn't have this.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.510
Sorry.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.034
This is ridiculous.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.601
I've cried twice in my life.

33:58.645 --> 34:01.082
Oh, it's okay. We...

34:01.126 --> 34:02.431
we cry all the time
around here.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.085
Totally.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.913
Okay.

34:05.956 --> 34:10.831
Anyway, I'm leaning
towards yes tomorrow

34:10.874 --> 34:12.833
on the whole witch thing,

34:12.876 --> 34:15.314
but whatever you both
choose I'll be cool with.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.316
Thank you.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.534
I mean, come on.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.188
You both had mad
endorphin rushes, right?

34:20.232 --> 34:21.755
That was next level.

34:21.798 --> 34:25.019
And clearly it was
Mom's dying wish.

34:25.063 --> 34:29.110
Sorry,
this is what she does.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.634
Can we go back to
whatever we do, you're cool?

34:33.158 --> 34:34.289
I am cool.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.117
I'm trying to be cool.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.554
I want to be cool.

34:41.644 --> 34:44.125
HARRY:
You are the Charmed Ones,

34:44.169 --> 34:45.996
witches who are destined
to save the world.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.302
MEL: The demon
who killed our mother.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.087
We can figure out
who killed her.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.134
HARRY :
There was ice at the scene.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.441
MEL : We can
figure out who killed her.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.225
HARRY: Cold is a characteristic. Cold.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.661
There are literally thousands
of different demons

34:58.705 --> 35:00.141
associated with cold.

35:03.579 --> 35:06.626
Do I look righteously angry,
like I'd fit in at a rally?

35:06.669 --> 35:08.889
You look good. Listen,
it wasn't cold, right?

35:08.932 --> 35:10.282
What?
Sorry.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.284
I haven't slept.
I'm a scientist.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.982
Evidence is repeatable and with
Demon Brian it wasn't cold,

35:15.025 --> 35:16.984
which means he wasn't the
demon who killed our mother.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.160
