00:17.851 --> 00:21.378
- Thanks for the beer.
- Thanks for the lift.

00:23.123 --> 00:27.321
- So, big plans for the weekend?
- Oh, huge.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.363
Microwave pizza, satellite TV.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.623
Wow.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.826
Thanks for making my life sound exciting.

00:35.869 --> 00:40.306
Maybe we both need pets.
They say people with pets live longer.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.035
l was thinking about getting a cat.

00:43.143 --> 00:48.046
There's dog people and there's cat people.
You are a dog person, John.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.548
How do you figure?

00:52.018 --> 00:54.077
You're faithful.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.348
You're dependable.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.355
You're without guile.

00:59.426 --> 01:03.055
And you're very comfortable to be around.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.259
So why a cat?

01:10.370 --> 01:16.002
Low maintenance. They don't expect much
from you, so you can't disappoint them.

01:16.076 --> 01:20.240
l don't see you ever
disappointing anyone, John.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.287
See you Monday?

01:38.398 --> 01:40.389
Yeah.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.059
See ya.

02:09.429 --> 02:12.330
John, John, John.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.827
- Miss?
- Reyes.

02:41.928 --> 02:45.295
How are you feeling tonight?

02:45.365 --> 02:47.458
You with us?

03:24.237 --> 03:26.501
Hello?

03:26.573 --> 03:28.666
ls anybody here?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.936
Hello.

05:11.010 --> 05:16.573
lt's OK. l was a little freaked out too. At first.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.914
- Who are you?
- Steven Murdock.

05:19.986 --> 05:25.788
l don't even know if that matters anymore,
but my name is Steven.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.956
Did you just look outside?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.165
Yeah.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.965
Don't do that.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.507
Where did everybody go?

05:46.612 --> 05:49.945
l think the question is: where did we go?

05:50.983 --> 05:54.043
Were you in an accident?

05:54.153 --> 05:57.452
l think l was hit by a car on my way home.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.718
l came in with chest pains.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.818
Mr Barreiro! Someone new.

06:07.166 --> 06:12.001
l found Mr Barreiro wandering around here,
same as you.

06:13.139 --> 06:18.167
He fell at a construction site
where he used to work.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.573
You think we're dead.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.324
No.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.761
No, l don't believe that.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.264
Have you ever been dead?

06:43.069 --> 06:46.903
So how do you know you're not?

07:20.773 --> 07:24.174
Hell of a thing to wake up to, huh?

07:28.114 --> 07:31.606
We stopped after work.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.777
She had a beer.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.148
The man who hit her had 15.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.361
Don't do this to yourself, John.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.276
lt's true, John.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.487
She's gone.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.984
l don't accept that.

08:14.494 --> 08:20.194
Look at her breathing. Her heart's
still beating. There's gotta be hope.

08:21.834 --> 08:26.703
There's no measurable
electrical activity in her brain.

08:26.806 --> 08:31.038
Brain death is indeed death, John.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.309
l'm sorry.

09:13.219 --> 09:19.021
The thing is, it's not that bad,
once you get used to the idea.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.685
Have you seen this?

09:21.761 --> 09:24.423
lt's nonsense, all of it.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.402
There's not a single sign
on any of the walls here. Why is that?

09:35.107 --> 09:37.871
You say we're dead.

09:37.944 --> 09:43.883
This seem like heaven to you?
A big, deserted Catholic hospital?

09:43.950 --> 09:46.043
l didn't say this was heaven.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.986
For all l know, it's... it's hell.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.490
l don't know anything for sure.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.796
Maybe this place is a way station,
a stop on the road to what comes next.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.939
- Where are you going?
- l'm finding a way out.

10:58.290 --> 11:02.818
Jack Preijers. l'm very sorry for your loss.

11:05.731 --> 11:12.637
Look, you two are the experts, but there's
gotta be something more that can be done.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.730
l wish there were.

11:14.840 --> 11:20.710
And l don't mean to make this any harder, but
l do have information you both need to hear.

11:21.647 --> 11:26.812
Your partner had a living will.
She signed an organ donor card.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.013
Uh-uh. No way.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.716
- John...
- Just slow down, all right?

11:33.726 --> 11:39.187
She's lying there in one piece.
There's no fractures, no damage to her skull.

11:40.066 --> 11:45.595
- Does that add up to you?
- John, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.833
That doesn't change
the diagnosis or her prognosis.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.574
ln these situations
time is always of the essence.

11:53.679 --> 11:57.342
There is a woman in Minnesota
who can be saved by your friend's heart.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.351
ln a real sense she will live on.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.064
Mr Murdock?

12:13.132 --> 12:15.430
Mr Barreiro?

12:23.275 --> 12:25.368
You! Stop!

12:47.233 --> 12:49.292
Monica!

12:51.937 --> 12:53.632
Monica!

13:01.413 --> 13:03.813
What's happening to him?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.680
Oh, my God!

13:33.512 --> 13:36.481
l am so very sorry for your loss.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.024
They're burning up
the phone lines down there,

14:24.096 --> 14:27.759
arranging with all these other hospitals
how to divvy up Monica.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.360
They say they could do it
as early as tomorrow.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.667
ls there anything? Anything at all?

14:37.409 --> 14:43.405
l did note minor swelling in the left anterior,
consistent with subdural hematoma.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.312
Minor swelling?

14:47.319 --> 14:49.913
l don't know if that means anything.

14:50.022 --> 14:55.654
lt's not like there's an exact formula
for how much damage equals death.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.673
What about this?

15:10.709 --> 15:14.577
This was monitoring her brain activity,
the electrical impulses?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.079
Yeah.

15:16.181 --> 15:20.049
She had EEG monitoring
after the point that she coded.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.953
So then, itjust stopped here. Right here.

15:24.556 --> 15:29.755
And if we can learn what this is,
maybe we can reverse it.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.891
Agent Doggett?

15:37.369 --> 15:41.931
OK. So this woman you saw,
she went through the wall?

15:42.041 --> 15:45.704
l don't know.
She was here, and then she disappeared.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.236
Disappeared? What do you mean?
Like Mr Barreiro did?

15:49.315 --> 15:51.749
Different than Barreiro.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.913
OK, OK. Let's concentrate on one
unexplainable event at a time here.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.218
What the hell happened to Mr Barreiro?

15:58.290 --> 16:01.487
My opinion? l think he died.

16:04.563 --> 16:07.498
You can't die if you're already dead,

16:07.599 --> 16:11.763
which backs up my belief
that you and l are alive.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.340
- l have no idea where she went.
- Hold on.

16:16.442 --> 16:20.242
lf he's dead and we're not,

16:22.948 --> 16:25.746
then where the hell are we?

16:30.456 --> 16:32.481
Dr Preijers.

16:32.591 --> 16:34.320
l'll be there in one minute.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.589
l'm wondering about this moment
on my partner's EEG tape,

16:37.663 --> 16:40.598
8:11pm, when brain death
apparently occurred.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.193
- You're reviewing our records?
- No offense, but yeah.

16:44.303 --> 16:47.739
l need to know if there's a change
in her condition before this.

16:47.840 --> 16:54.177
- lf you're trying to build a malpractice case...
- l'm not. l just want the facts.

16:55.881 --> 17:01.183
Whitney, would you pull the code notes
from earlier tonight, please?

17:01.253 --> 17:04.814
Look, Monica had a seat belt
and an air bag protecting her.

17:04.890 --> 17:10.328
The ambulance crew said she was conscious
at the scene. l think we're missing something.

17:10.396 --> 17:15.891
l don't think this'll help you any, but this
describes what my team and l did to save her.

17:16.001 --> 17:19.164
You can take it, copy it,
study it at your leisure.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.035
Dr Preijers?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.066
lt's all right.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.937
You work here?

17:57.042 --> 18:00.307
l'm a patient aid.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.177
l deliver the flowers, mostly.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.745
Are you her husband?

18:15.928 --> 18:19.056
You love her, though.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.581
She's not gone.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.380
Not her soul.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.586
l wish l could talk to her.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.489
l wish l could tell her.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.563
Guess l wish a lot of things.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.668
Come on. You're not giving up, are you?

20:41.940 --> 20:44.340
Monica.

20:45.344 --> 20:49.246
Please, don't run.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.909
Who are you?

20:55.020 --> 20:57.716
l'm Audrey.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.690
l work at the hospital.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.623
Audrey, l'm Monica.

21:08.367 --> 21:12.235
Steven and l just wanna get out of here.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.975
Will you show us the way out?

21:18.076 --> 21:21.944
l can't. l can't help you.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.878
Why not?

21:27.119 --> 21:30.987
l came to tell you, your friend...

21:33.058 --> 21:35.492
loves you very much.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.755
My friend?

21:40.165 --> 21:45.262
Did you talk to John?
Does he know where l am?

21:46.104 --> 21:48.402
They all think you're dead.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.244
Wait! Give my friend a message.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.579
Tell him he's a dog person.

22:22.941 --> 22:25.637
- Hey, Whitney.
- lt's not my place to say,

22:25.711 --> 22:28.305
but you might wanna review the code notes.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.438
Why?

22:29.514 --> 22:33.951
There was an injection you gave Ms Reyes
that wasn't in the notes.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.987
l don't think so.

22:36.054 --> 22:41.890
ln trauma bay, l saw you administer
an lV push. l assume it was epinephrine.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.057
l have no memory of that.

22:46.164 --> 22:49.998
- Anybody else see that?
- Just me. But it happened.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.730
My only point being,
if there is an investigation,

22:52.838 --> 22:56.899
that's the kind of inconsistency
malpractice lawyers love to get ahold of.

22:57.008 --> 23:01.502
Whitney, thank you so much
for looking out for me.

23:38.116 --> 23:40.607
There's cat people and there's dog people.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.517
You are a dog person, John.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.218
You're faithful.

23:48.293 --> 23:51.023
You're dependable.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.530
You're without guile.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.558
And you're very comfortable to be around.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.376
l don't see you ever
disappointing anyone, John.

24:12.651 --> 24:15.882
Oh, my God!

24:15.954 --> 24:17.922
Get me some help in here!

24:26.064 --> 24:28.828
What exactly are you thinking?

24:28.934 --> 24:31.926
She helped work on Monica.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.938
l ask questions about
what happened in the trauma bay,

24:35.006 --> 24:37.975
and she very inconveniently drops dead.

24:38.076 --> 24:41.409
You think somebody murdered her
to cover something up?

24:41.480 --> 24:45.473
lf it were you, how would you
make it look like natural causes?

24:45.584 --> 24:48.985
l'd use a fast-acting barbiturate
like pentobarbital.

24:49.087 --> 24:53.820
l'd use a small-bore needle to make it
next to impossible to find an injection mark.

24:53.925 --> 24:57.258
''Next to impossible.''
That's why you're perfect for the job.

24:57.329 --> 25:02.198
- Should probably test her blood too, right?
- Agent Doggett, l...

25:02.300 --> 25:05.201
l'm happy to do this for you.

25:05.303 --> 25:09.034
Just don't kid yourself that
this is gonna somehow bring her back.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.852
Your name is John, right?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.465
She has a message for you.

25:37.502 --> 25:41.131
She says you're a dog person.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.849
Wait.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.851
Where did you get that?
Who said that to you?

25:58.924 --> 26:01.518
l told you.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.061
She's not gone.

26:15.874 --> 26:19.901
l went through every last page of that
before you ever got here.

26:20.011 --> 26:23.572
lt's just nonsense, just like you said.

26:23.682 --> 26:26.242
There's not a clue in it.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.244
Maybe in itself it's a clue.

26:32.457 --> 26:38.726
This place looks pretty complete
at first glance, but really it's not.

26:38.797 --> 26:43.257
There's so much missing: words, details.

26:43.969 --> 26:47.097
lt's like a set, a movie set.

26:47.872 --> 26:54.107
But like it was built by someone who couldn't
quite grasp what it was they were recreating.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.983
Steven?

27:01.086 --> 27:03.486
Are you OK?

27:07.926 --> 27:10.258
Steven, talk to me.

27:11.963 --> 27:16.229
What... What's happening to me?

27:23.642 --> 27:26.110
Does he feel any pain?

27:30.849 --> 27:32.612
Absolutely none.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.621
lt's just a matter of time now.

27:53.538 --> 27:57.770
- You live down here?
- The nuns let me stay.

27:58.877 --> 28:03.678
l wanted to be a nurse, only l can't do much.

28:03.782 --> 28:06.342
But they let me help out.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.495
This is this hospital.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.159
You made this?

28:28.173 --> 28:29.970
Why?

28:33.144 --> 28:36.170
l like to visit it.

28:36.247 --> 28:40.377
l sort of go... inside my head.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.717
You go into the model?

28:45.824 --> 28:49.419
l like it there. lt's quiet.

28:51.029 --> 28:56.899
l used to have it all to myself,
but then some people showed up.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.367
Hospital patients.

28:59.437 --> 29:01.701
Your friend.

29:04.242 --> 29:08.201
This is where you say you talk to her?
Right inside here?

29:12.917 --> 29:19.186
Not so much like
tiny people in a model, but...

29:21.726 --> 29:26.390
lnside my head. Up here, l guess.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.039
You don't believe me.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.799
Audrey...

29:40.311 --> 29:45.578
you said that you saw
some other people besides my friend.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.880
Other patients?

29:52.323 --> 29:55.451
Can you tell me who they are?

30:08.673 --> 30:17.012
There's so much... l'd do differently.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.247
What?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.752
Life.

30:33.798 --> 30:38.599
Monica's parents are on their way
from Mexico City, coming to say goodbye.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.695
They can say hello instead.

30:40.805 --> 30:44.366
Nobody's shutting off her
life-support system, not with what l got.

30:44.475 --> 30:46.636
What are these?

30:48.646 --> 30:50.978
Patient files.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.984
Both men were declared brain-dead,
same as her.

30:54.052 --> 30:58.489
All three have something else in common too.
Check out the attending physician.

31:01.926 --> 31:03.518
Dr Jack Preijers.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.691
He's some kind of Dr Death, gets off on
pulling the plug on his own patients.

31:07.765 --> 31:10.757
Did it last night to this guy Barreiro.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.531
At the request of the family.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.097
What if he poisoned Barreiro
in the first place?

31:17.208 --> 31:20.575
Same as this guy Steven Murdock,
same as Monica.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.044
The tox screen'll prove it.

31:24.215 --> 31:28.379
How did you come up with
these two men's names?

31:28.453 --> 31:32.048
lf l tell you that, you'll think l'm crazy.

31:32.123 --> 31:35.684
But Monica's alive,
same as this guy Murdock.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.593
We gotta help 'em both get back.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.195
Steven, stay with me.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.797
Audrey, it's John Doggett.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.043
Audrey?

33:13.558 --> 33:15.788
l still need your help.

33:15.860 --> 33:20.820
l told you their names -
Mr Barreiro and Mr Murdock.

33:20.898 --> 33:23.492
They're both dead.
Monica's the only one left.

33:23.568 --> 33:27.368
lnside an hour the hospital plans
to cut off her life-support.

33:27.472 --> 33:32.842
l'm not gonna let that happen,
no matter what it takes, but l'm losing here.

33:32.910 --> 33:36.243
Nobody else believes she's alive.
Nobody, just you and me.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.747
l can't do anything.

33:38.850 --> 33:43.184
l only deliver the flowers.
That's all l do. l can't help.

33:43.254 --> 33:46.314
You can talk to her, right? You can.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.420
Audrey...

33:52.530 --> 33:57.024
l need you to talk to her.
l need you to tell her what's going on.

33:57.101 --> 34:01.435
l need you to tell her
that they're gonna pull the plug.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.734
l need her to...

34:09.080 --> 34:11.344
l need you to tell her to fight.

34:11.416 --> 34:17.446
l need you to tell her to show us some sign,
anything, that she's in there.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.288
l need her to understand.

34:27.697 --> 34:30.393
l don't know what the hell else to do.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.824
Monica?

35:38.769 --> 35:41.863
John wanted me to tell you something.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.703
You gave him my message?

35:47.812 --> 35:51.805
He says you don't have very long.

35:51.883 --> 35:57.446
He says you have to give them
some kind of sign.

36:00.391 --> 36:03.451
l know. l'm sorry.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.625
Are you really gonna leave me here to die?

36:19.877 --> 36:24.177
l can't... do anything.

36:24.248 --> 36:26.546
There's something wrong.

36:26.651 --> 36:29.313
You know, up here?

36:29.387 --> 36:33.824
And l can't help anyone.

36:35.726 --> 36:40.459
l deliver the flowers. That's all l do.

36:41.165 --> 36:49.368
And l have to even get help with that
because l can't read who's on the little cards.

37:00.518 --> 37:03.180
You can't read?

37:03.254 --> 37:05.916
l see it all jumbled up.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.434
This is your hospital.

37:20.371 --> 37:22.931
lt's you who created it.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.337
lt's all you, Audrey.

37:28.846 --> 37:31.280
This place is all you.

37:31.382 --> 37:36.410
And that means you can make the rules work
any damn way that you want them to.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.020
You can help me escape.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.969
Audrey?

38:20.831 --> 38:24.995
You know, l've always wondered
what was down here.

38:28.105 --> 38:31.336
l'm being accused of things, Audrey.

38:31.442 --> 38:37.506
Terrible things regarding three patients
of mine. Really, it's beyond the pale.

38:50.861 --> 38:53.830
You're not gonna yell out, are you, Audrey?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.871
Audrey?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.056
Audrey?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.650
Audrey?

39:30.835 --> 39:32.860
Audrey, what's happening?

39:32.970 --> 39:35.871
You have to go.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.555
This way.

39:57.194 --> 39:58.889
No.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.358
lf l do that, l'll burn up. l'll die.

40:06.437 --> 40:10.168
No. Not now.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.334
But you have to hurry.

40:14.178 --> 40:16.009
What about you?

40:18.382 --> 40:20.441
l know now.

40:23.287 --> 40:26.688
l know who told me to build it.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.741
The transplant teams are in place.

41:30.287 --> 41:33.415
They're not cutting her up.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.450
John...

41:37.528 --> 41:40.827
l'm still waiting for your argument.

41:43.534 --> 41:49.495
lf you have something to convince me
to convince the doctors that she's alive.

41:51.108 --> 41:52.973
John?

42:12.396 --> 42:14.830
Audrey.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.039
Where are you going, Doctor?

42:39.189 --> 42:41.089
Oh, God.

42:41.191 --> 42:43.489
Oh, no.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.553
Good night.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.854
Good night.
