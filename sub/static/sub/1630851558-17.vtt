WEBVTT

00:10.067 --> 00:13.833
It's been about pretty damn
close to three weeks going
hard here in Rally Valley.

00:13.867 --> 00:17.467
And, uh, I'm thinking
I'm insane.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.833
[narrator] In a bid to enter
the mining big leagues

00:20.867 --> 00:26.600
and bank 2,000 ounces,
Rick Ness is trying a risky
new strategy.

00:26.633 --> 00:30.000
I mean, this was a,
you know, big gamble
shutting down the wash plant

00:30.033 --> 00:31.567
during prime time, um.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.233
All I'm doing right now
is spending money.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
I'm a few hundred thousand
dollars deep at this point.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.400
And, uh, we haven't been
getting any gold
the whole time,

00:41.433 --> 00:44.500
so it's just money
out the door.

00:44.533 --> 00:48.800
[narrator] He's digging out
120-feet
of worthless overburden.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.800
Over a million cubic yards
in the hopes

00:51.833 --> 00:54.767
of hitting the best pay dirt
he's ever mined.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.567
It's, uh, a ton of dirt
to move,

00:57.600 --> 01:01.567
but I do believe
that the payoff underneath
is gonna be worth it.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.600
[narrator] The pay lane
is estimated
to be 70 feet thick

01:05.633 --> 01:09.367
and the size
of two football fields.

01:09.400 --> 01:13.500
We've been, uh, hauling
massive amounts of dirt
out of this, uh,

01:14.267 --> 01:15.667
out of Rally Valley.

01:15.700 --> 01:21.133
Night shift, day shift,
um, I'm macing 24/7
I guess you would say.

01:21.167 --> 01:24.267
[narrator] They're down
90 feet and should hit pay

01:24.300 --> 01:26.967
after removing
the next 30 feet of mud.

01:29.267 --> 01:31.533
[Rick] By the end
of this week,
we might be there.

01:32.933 --> 01:34.733
[Chris] All we've gotta do
is get Monster Red running

01:34.767 --> 01:37.067
and we can push that thing
over 300 yards an hour.

01:37.067 --> 01:40.633
And we're gonna need that
because this now is a ton
of dirt to wash.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.367
We are gonna turn
that wash plant on,

01:43.400 --> 01:47.400
we are not gonna shut it off
because, uh, we've gotta get
a lot of material sluiced

01:47.433 --> 01:49.567
if we're gonna hit
our 2,000 ounces.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.067
If this doesn't work out,
I mean, we're gonna
make nothing.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.633
Um, my guys, you know,
they're gonna lose
their bonus

01:55.667 --> 01:57.633
and, uh, I'm gonna
be done mining.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.533
Uh, that's how
serious this is.

02:05.267 --> 02:08.900
Now I'm into... There's
something that seems to have
awfully big rock in it.

02:08.933 --> 02:12.967
It's, uh, it's not something
that I was expecting. Not yet.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.667
I mean, this seems
kind of for, like,
a boulder layer,

02:16.700 --> 02:19.667
like, something I would expect
at the bottom.

02:21.667 --> 02:22.667
This is weird.

02:24.933 --> 02:27.067
[Rick on radio] Yeah, guys,
before I load anymore
of this out,

02:27.067 --> 02:29.733
um, just chill out
for awhile.

02:29.767 --> 02:32.367
Do we have time
to mess around right now?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.567
I don't know
what the hell this is.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.133
Worth looking at, though.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.700
If I'm being honest,
it looks like a pay layer
to me.

02:49.733 --> 02:52.433
This is what, I mean,
this is what we've been
looking for all season

02:52.467 --> 02:53.833
in the other areas.

02:53.867 --> 02:56.067
I mean, this looks like...

02:56.100 --> 02:59.800
This looks like this was laid
in here by some kind
of water event.

02:59.833 --> 03:03.867
Generally, big boulders
around here mean pay layer,
they mean gold.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.733
But it's definitely
not where it's supposed to be.

03:05.767 --> 03:06.933
Not according
to the drill results

03:06.967 --> 03:09.300
and not according
to all the data I have.

03:11.933 --> 03:15.300
We're working our way down,
and now we got
a [bleep] mystery here.

03:15.333 --> 03:18.833
Like, but I can't
just ignore it.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.900
I'm just gonna have
to test it off the pan
or something.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.500
I mean, if there's gold in it,
what am I gonna do with it?

03:29.533 --> 03:33.067
I don't have Monster Red
set up, I don't have
anything set up.

03:33.067 --> 03:35.633
And I don't know
how much gold there is.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.067
I don't know, whatever,
I gotta... Just gonna test it.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.167
Then I'll know.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.433
This is classic Duncan Creek.
Constant curveballs.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Should be enough.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.733
[sighs] Yeah,
this is actually like a...

04:15.967 --> 04:17.800
A really heavy pan.
It seems like there's gonna

04:17.833 --> 04:20.133
be a lot
of heavy minerals in here.

04:20.167 --> 04:23.867
Where there's heavy rock,
sand, and magnetite,
and hematite, stuff like that,

04:23.900 --> 04:26.067
there's... there's
usually gold.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.200
What the [bleep]?

04:36.067 --> 04:39.667
There's gotta be 25,
30 colors in here.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.067
Holy [bleep].

04:43.067 --> 04:46.567
That's probably the best pan
I've ever done in my life.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.733
I was not expecting that.
That's a lot of gold
in a pan, so...

04:51.767 --> 04:53.567
That changes everything.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.933
[narrator] Rick has hit
pay dirt 30 feet earlier
than he expected.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.067
We gotta run it
and get the gold out,
but it's not...

05:01.900 --> 05:04.067
It's not that simple, I mean.

05:04.067 --> 05:07.567
I don't have a wash plant
anywhere near here
that's set up ready to go.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.567
Just not prepared for it.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.467
Um.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.100
I'm gonna have to come up
with some kind of plan.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.167
[Rick] I need
everybody to stop
what they're doing.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.900
Let's just meet up.
Have a quick pow wow.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.300
Stop paying trucks for what?

05:30.633 --> 05:33.133
Honestly, guys, I think we got
down to pay here.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.200
You know it's those boulders
popping out, right?

05:35.233 --> 05:41.133
So, I took a pan out of there
and probably the best [bleep]
pan I've ever done ever.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.867
[Chris] Oh, nice.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.200
Yeah, like, there was a ton
of [bleep] colors in it.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.867
[man 1] I did not expect that.
That changes things.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.633
Yeah, buddy, I like
the sound of that.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.900
Well, at least we're going
in the right direction then.

05:52.933 --> 05:57.200
It's tough, though, I don't
always trust pans, like,
so to be sure,

05:57.233 --> 05:59.600
I wanna pull 1,000 yards
out of there
and I wanna run it.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.333
Like, we're just gonna
run it through Rocky.

06:01.367 --> 06:04.867
[narrator] Wash plant
Monster Red
is still in pieces.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.900
Rick must haul the pay dirt
to his smaller
wash plant, Rocky,

06:08.933 --> 06:10.500
at the other end of the claim.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.400
[Chris] That's really far up.

06:13.433 --> 06:14.900
Might as well run to Milwaukee
with it.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.100
[all laughing]

06:16.133 --> 06:18.267
I took the side by side
and I set the odometer

06:18.300 --> 06:22.367
and if we went around,
it's actually [bleep] just
over 2.5 miles.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.533
[Chris] Oh, wow.

06:23.567 --> 06:27.933
But, but we can just push
across this valley right here.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.767
-[Chris] Great.
-[Rick] That's a mile.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.733
-Holy [bleep].
-[man 1] That's
a big difference.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.167
-[Rick] Yeah.
-[Chris] Bridge the gap
between that cut and Rocky.

06:34.633 --> 06:35.633
[Rick] Yeah.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.967
Cuts it way more than half.

06:38.067 --> 06:40.667
[narrator] To run the pay
as fast as possible,

06:40.700 --> 06:44.500
Rick plans to build a bridge
across the valley

06:44.533 --> 06:49.700
and a new road
to haul pay dirt a mile
south to wash plant Rocky.

06:49.733 --> 06:52.067
How long do you think
it'll take to build that?
It's pretty deep.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.200
It is pretty deep,
but we've got
all that material.

06:54.233 --> 06:58.067
Like, parked right there,
you know, if we just start
by pushing it with the dozer,

06:58.100 --> 07:01.167
and fill in the rest
with the trucks, like, we just
all, you know, get after it.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.633
I bet we can get it finished
this afternoon.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.433
Well, [bleep].
Let's get on it, then.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.067
Well, this bridge is not
gonna build itself.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.933
-[all laughing]
-[Rick]
[bleep] Let's do it then.

07:08.967 --> 07:10.667
-[bleep]
-[man laughing]

07:14.133 --> 07:15.467
I don't understand
why it's here.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.600
We're still...

07:18.067 --> 07:20.233
...way too high up
to be hitting pay layer.

07:21.133 --> 07:24.067
But this... you can't
throw it away.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.833
And, uh...

07:26.867 --> 07:28.767
You just have to work
a little harder
and a little faster.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
[Tony speaking]

07:45.667 --> 07:50.167
[narrator] Tony Beets
is battling to hit
his season goal

07:50.200 --> 07:52.433
and keep his operation afloat.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.767
[narrator] Two-thirds
of the way through the season,

08:02.800 --> 08:07.567
he has 2,500 ounces,
just over half what he needs.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.233
[narrator] Tony's sluicing
gold rich pay

08:17.267 --> 08:22.067
from the wall cut
through his only running
wash plant: Mike's trommel.

08:22.067 --> 08:26.100
But heavy rain is flooding
the cut and soaking the pay.

08:28.933 --> 08:29.867
[Tony speaking]

08:42.800 --> 08:46.700
It's, uh, hard to get in
and out of the cuts
'cause it's so slippery.

08:46.733 --> 08:51.700
It costs a lot of time,
and so it costs Tony
a lot of money.

08:52.567 --> 08:53.567
[Tony speaking]

09:24.100 --> 09:27.500
We're dealing with this really
soupy, muddy stuff

09:27.533 --> 09:31.700
which needs
to be quite carefully put
through the plant.

09:31.733 --> 09:35.267
[narrator] The wet pay
is slowing down the plant.

09:35.300 --> 09:41.233
[Ruby] Unfortunately, it has
to run on a very slow feed
which drives me crazy.

09:41.267 --> 09:45.333
I just want to turn
this [bleep] thing up
and sling dirt into her.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.800
And it also needs a little bit
more time to be washed
in the trommel

09:48.833 --> 09:53.100
so that we actually separate
the gold from this muddy
clay material

09:53.133 --> 09:55.767
and it doesn't just get washed
out right out the back end.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.667
[sighs]

10:00.633 --> 10:01.600
Blah.

10:04.267 --> 10:06.233
Hey, Ruby.
How it's going with you today?

10:08.700 --> 10:09.867
[Ruby on radio]
Going slow, Kevin.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.267
There better be some good
[bleep] gold today.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.300
[Kevin laughs]

10:18.467 --> 10:20.067
[Kevin] Let's have
a looksee today.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.100
[Kevin exclaims]

10:30.767 --> 10:32.467
Hey, Cody, Cody.
We're gonna have to shut down.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.667
That kind of sucks.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.167
Oh, that worked absolutely
like [bleep].

11:09.200 --> 11:11.733
[man 1] I tried shoveling,
but you can't keep up.
You can't.

11:11.767 --> 11:13.467
[Kevin] No, not with this.
Okay.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.067
[groans]

11:16.100 --> 11:20.200
[narrator] Tony Beets'
mining operation has come
to a halt.

11:20.233 --> 11:23.267
A buildup of wet pay
in the hopper feeder

11:23.300 --> 11:26.700
has forced them to shut down
the wash plant.

11:26.733 --> 11:28.633
[Kevin] Now the stuff
we're putting through
is real gooey

11:28.667 --> 11:30.333
and all the stuff
that's popping up
over the back

11:30.367 --> 11:33.433
and piling up real
[bleeping] like this pile

11:33.467 --> 11:36.267
has got that high
in about six hours.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.500
So let's get some folks
in here with some shovels.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.800
Hey, Tony, yeah.
Well, this stuff
is really gooey.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.333
You got a lot of over spill,
I had to shut her down.

11:46.367 --> 11:47.367
[Tony speaking]

11:57.833 --> 11:58.833
[Kevin grunts]

12:01.067 --> 12:06.367
Yeah, oh, yeah, we don't
really got much other option
other than shoveling it out.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.233
[grunts] He can get real fancy
with his ideas,
but you know what?

12:10.067 --> 12:11.533
We can just [bleep] shovel it.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.700
[Kevin grunts]

12:13.733 --> 12:17.600
Well, with all this dirt
falling on the tail pulley,
it's gonna get buried.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.433
That applies weight
and pressure.

12:19.467 --> 12:23.267
Which will slow the belt down,
which will cause the pile up,

12:23.300 --> 12:25.800
which will cause us
even more shoveling.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.700
So when the material
drops onto the conveyer belt,

12:29.733 --> 12:32.667
because this material
is so wet and soupy,

12:32.700 --> 12:35.900
it's actually just sliding
right off the back
of the conveyer

12:35.933 --> 12:37.933
and piling up
on our tail pulleys.

12:37.967 --> 12:38.967
[Kevin] Come on.

12:39.867 --> 12:41.467
Every minute
that this plant's down,

12:41.500 --> 12:44.100
we're losing,
like, $25 a minute.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.300
-That is pretty good
right there, honestly.
-[man] Yeah.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.200
Now we got everything
shoveled out.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.100
Hopefully it doesn't pile up
like that [bleep] again.

12:51.133 --> 12:51.967
[grunts]

12:53.300 --> 12:54.433
Do we got it?

12:54.467 --> 12:57.567
Okay, now we put
our chain across.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.467
That feels good. All right.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.967
Let's fire her up,
so we get you boys
back on your trucks.

13:12.133 --> 13:12.967
And out.

13:22.267 --> 13:26.667
[narrator] After three hours,
Tony is back on the gold.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.667
Onto the next cup of haul.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.867
[Fred] The most important goal
I have is to give my team
a future.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.500
[narrator] Forty miles west
of Dawson City,

13:53.533 --> 13:58.067
at California Creek,
Fred Lewis is attempting
to turn his band

13:58.067 --> 14:03.300
of combat veterans
into a successful
mining operation.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.400
[Fred] We've been sluicing
a few weeks,
but we're falling short.

14:06.433 --> 14:09.133
In order to cover the costs
for this season,

14:09.167 --> 14:11.433
we need to get a minimum
of 100 ounces.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.633
[narrator] So far this season,
Fred's hauled in
just 40 ounces.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.133
[Fred] We don't have a lot
of time left in the season,

14:18.167 --> 14:21.267
we're gonna have to figure
something out to up
our efficiency

14:21.300 --> 14:22.500
and get to that goal.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.700
You know, we have a lot
to do in a very little bit
of time but, you know,

14:30.733 --> 14:34.400
that's what we do,
we made a living
out of doing the impossible.

14:34.433 --> 14:37.600
It's a little bit
of hard work, but that's what
I came here to do.

14:37.633 --> 14:43.600
[narrator] Fred has shut down
the wash plant to inspect
the gold catching sluice runs.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.333
I don't know if I like
the looks of this.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.733
This looks
like it's building up
too much.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.067
Only one way to know.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.833
So right now, I'm looking
at my tailings
because the, um,

14:58.867 --> 15:02.367
the sluice just doesn't look
like it's packing right.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.067
And I'm seeing gold
in this sluice,
which is bad.

15:05.067 --> 15:08.067
If I'm seeing gold
that's being shot out
into my tailings pond,

15:08.900 --> 15:10.967
that means we're losing gold.

15:11.067 --> 15:14.533
So we're either gonna have
to fix our feed rate

15:14.567 --> 15:16.300
or do something
about these sluices.

15:17.533 --> 15:18.567
That's too much.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
That's not good.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.600
[Fred] We're losing gold.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.800
[Stuart] Really? [bleep]

15:32.833 --> 15:34.500
[Fred] It's not catching
material the right way.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.967
Goes from 2 feet
to 4 feet, wham!

15:37.067 --> 15:38.733
It's a lot of force
coming out,

15:38.767 --> 15:41.367
and distribute over
a very short distance.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.767
Right now, we need
something to take
this material gradually.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.400
-So I'm feeling, like,
a sluice ahead.
-[Stuart] Yeah.

15:48.433 --> 15:49.367
Feeding into these.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.667
Now we need to add length.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.333
I want to talk to Buzz
about it, see if he feels
the same way.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.800
Buzz!

15:55.833 --> 16:00.300
[narrator] Fred brings in
Buzz Legault, an experienced
Yukon miner.

16:00.333 --> 16:04.133
I don't know as much
about welding as you do,
but do you think

16:04.167 --> 16:09.800
if we add 6 feet onto this,
you and JB could put
something together?

16:09.833 --> 16:12.333
-You prefound everything?
Get it all set up?
-[Fred] Yeah.

16:12.367 --> 16:16.267
[Buzz] Once you get things
all cleaned up and pull
these sluices off,

16:16.300 --> 16:18.200
that'll be a couple
of hours, right?

16:18.233 --> 16:19.433
I think that's what
we have to do.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.900
[Buzz] Let's get
this [bleep] done.

16:20.933 --> 16:22.200
-All right, Buzz.
-[Stuart] Cool.

16:22.233 --> 16:26.067
[narrator] With his 4-foot
sluices, Fred's losing gold

16:26.067 --> 16:29.300
that's blowing out
into the tailings.

16:29.333 --> 16:35.133
By adding a 6-foot extension,
the extra riffles should catch
all the gold

16:35.167 --> 16:38.300
and stop it being lost
out the end of the sluices.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.400
It'll be a major gamechanger

16:42.200 --> 16:43.767
for this entire season.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.333
We'll be able
to do more yardage.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.133
Better recovery.

16:48.167 --> 16:51.133
Buzz brought in, ah,
some sluice box pieces.

16:51.167 --> 16:56.700
Now we're gonna modify
them to, ah, go
into our current sluice boxes.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.200
These are just pieces
of it for now.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.900
Buzz hasn't met his house.
[laughs]

17:01.933 --> 17:04.567
He has everything known
to mankind at his house.

17:10.433 --> 17:12.167
[JB] So we're gonna cut
that in half.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.367
We're gonna add 6 feet
on each side.

17:19.600 --> 17:24.167
Adding six square foot
for the gold to, basically,
travel down

17:24.200 --> 17:25.700
and get separated
from the tailings,

17:25.733 --> 17:29.400
so that's just more
opportunity for it to get
trapped and kept.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.667
As opposed to getting
washed out.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.067
[JB] It's time to unhook
the old one.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.333
And then rehook the new one.

17:36.367 --> 17:40.667
Everything we're working on
is heavy and not easy to move.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.767
All right, Fred!

17:42.967 --> 17:43.967
We are ready.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.400
Right there.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.100
[Fred] It's looking
good, guys.

17:51.133 --> 17:53.167
[Buzz] Yeah, we just
got her finished up.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.767
[Fred] Man, so this is, like,
an extra...

17:57.767 --> 18:00.067
This should double
our yardage.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.100
[narrator] More than doubling
the length of the sluice box,

18:03.133 --> 18:05.633
should not only fix
the gold lost,

18:05.667 --> 18:08.500
but also allow them
to run more pay dirt.

18:09.167 --> 18:11.100
So 6 feet added on to this...

18:13.667 --> 18:15.767
...could put us close
to 85 yards an hour.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.467
I wanna get this thing
fired up and tested.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.900
[machinery starting]

18:30.400 --> 18:31.833
Yeah, I like it.

18:31.867 --> 18:35.633
Now it's gonna come
through here and distribute.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.400
The best part we know
is the riffles are working.

18:38.433 --> 18:41.233
We wanna see
these riffles with a little
bit of bumps on 'em.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.633
We don't want to see
a flow across with no bumps.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.633
If we see bumps,
we're seeing the right
kind of flow.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.500
-[JB] Okay.
-[Fred] Yeah, it looks great.

18:47.533 --> 18:50.400
Ah, I love it.
It's feeding perfect
right down it.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.700
Hey, I'm gonna start feeding.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.467
I'm really excited
that this is finally
coming together.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.267
-I think
this is a good system.
-Yeah, for sure.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.933
-[Fred] Good job, guys.
-[JB] Thanks.

19:04.733 --> 19:07.967
Sluice extension on that
should double the amount
of pay we can put

19:08.067 --> 19:09.900
through that plant
and stop losing gold.

19:09.933 --> 19:11.500
It's something we absolutely
had to do.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
[Tony speaking]

19:34.300 --> 19:39.467
[narrator] Torrential rain
has turned Tony Beets'
wall cut into a quagmire.

19:39.500 --> 19:45.233
Now Tony's digging a ditch
to drain excess water
and dry out the wet pay dirt.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.467
[Tony speaking]

20:18.933 --> 20:22.533
[narrator] Tony will have
to wait a week for the cut
to dry out

20:22.567 --> 20:25.333
before he can run
the pay dirt.

20:25.367 --> 20:29.467
And the stock pile pay
at the trommel
has now run out.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.733
[Kevin on radio]
Hey, Tony. Yup.

20:44.567 --> 20:45.833
[Kevin] Copy that. Copy that.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.667
[narrator] Every hour
the trommel is down

20:55.700 --> 21:00.333
costs Tony $1,500
in lost gold production.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.233
Oh, it's a [bleep].
Yeah, mess.

21:10.267 --> 21:12.067
We're running out of time
in the season as is

21:12.067 --> 21:14.833
and by the time to wait
for [bleep] pay to dry.

21:37.933 --> 21:42.500
[narrator] At Paradise Hill,
Tony Beets is battling
the floods.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.300
[Kevin] Mmm-hmm.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.067
That sounds like a plan.

22:01.067 --> 22:04.667
[narrator] For years,
the King of the Klondike
has been stashing away

22:04.700 --> 22:08.300
smaller pay piles
for a rainy day.

22:08.333 --> 22:14.667
Now he wants to tap into one
that sits in between the wall
and nugget cuts.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.367
But there's no way
to get to it.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.767
[Kevin] How are we gonna
get in there? Do we gotta
build a road or what?

22:32.567 --> 22:33.467
[Kevin] Mmm-hmm. Yup.

22:35.467 --> 22:36.467
Sounds good.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.633
[Megan] We have pay just
back here that we need
to get to.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.533
So we're building a road
over top of all this

22:48.567 --> 22:51.067
'cause with all the weather
we've been having,
all the rain and stuff,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.500
it's been making
everything just slop.

22:56.100 --> 23:00.400
[narrator] To get to the stock
pile of dried pay on top
of the hill,

23:00.433 --> 23:03.800
Tony must build
a half mile hole road

23:03.833 --> 23:07.067
using mud capped
with coarse tailings

23:07.067 --> 23:11.067
to provide a solid way in
for his fleet of rock trucks.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.667
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah, I can hear you.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.600
So how's your day going?

23:26.833 --> 23:29.967
Boring. Very, very boring.
How's your day going?

23:30.967 --> 23:33.200
It's slow, you know,
going in circles.

23:33.233 --> 23:37.667
So, is today a podcast day?
Is it a music day?
Is it an audiobook day?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.700
Crimes of Passion day,
podcast.

23:41.767 --> 23:44.400
Great, great.
I love it, I love it.

23:44.433 --> 23:45.667
Yeah, what are you
listening to?

23:46.500 --> 23:48.533
My sad, sad thoughts.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.900
[Tony speaking]

25:04.400 --> 25:05.533
Copy that, copy that.

25:17.467 --> 25:20.500
[Megan] I am currently
about to feed the plant

25:20.533 --> 25:26.200
with the first bucket
from piggybank
that Tony has sent me.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.500
And it's very exciting.

25:27.533 --> 25:30.867
Cause it's very nice dirt.
It's dry, it's not soup.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.233
And it actually
goes where I want it,

25:33.267 --> 25:35.200
it doesn't slop off
the hopper.

25:38.167 --> 25:41.067
Rain brings
everybody down, so.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.400
I think we're all much happier
that the plant's
up and running

25:43.433 --> 25:45.400
and we can
actually be sluicing.

25:45.433 --> 25:46.833
[Tony speaking]

26:03.067 --> 26:07.067
[Chris] You know,
this valley's been separated
by this, this drain here.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.800
We're building a bridge.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.067
So we can get that pay
down to Rocky.

26:13.600 --> 26:18.067
[Paul] In Rally Valley,
Rick and his crew
have paused stripping,

26:18.067 --> 26:21.333
to build a shortcut
to his wash plant, Rocky.

26:21.367 --> 26:24.367
We're just about done here,
so we should be able
to put it to the test.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.767
But this is gonna slow us
to getting down to where we're
actually trying to go.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.700
[Paul] To test run
an unexpected layer
of bonus dirt.

26:31.733 --> 26:33.433
I wasn't prepared
for there to be a pay layer

26:33.467 --> 26:34.600
in the middle
of all this stripping.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.667
But, might as well sluice it
and see what's there.

26:37.667 --> 26:39.333
The whole idea
with Rally Valley here

26:39.367 --> 26:41.433
is to get Monster Red
up and running,

26:41.467 --> 26:45.867
um, but the time that we,
you know, we reach
the pay layer on the bottom.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.667
But, Monster Red's not ready.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.233
And we are not to the bottom
but we are already
at a pay layer.

26:53.967 --> 26:55.333
I panned it,
it seems pretty good,

26:55.367 --> 26:57.800
but I wanna run a test on it,
on our little plant.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.300
If I can get 1,000 yards
along this mile track

27:03.333 --> 27:05.367
to that plant
and we run it,
and test it,

27:05.400 --> 27:07.300
I think that there might be
gold in this layer.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.167
But the only way
we're gonna know

27:09.200 --> 27:12.700
is if we run it through
the plant and see
what we got, so.

27:12.733 --> 27:15.533
I'm gonna finish this bridge,
they're gonna haul it up,
we're gonna run it,

27:15.567 --> 27:17.433
and hopefully
we're gonna find
a lot of gold.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.167
[Chris] I'm super excited
to see this holds in store.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.933
I never really expected it
to be eventful,

27:24.967 --> 27:26.667
but it's definitely got
its moments.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.133
This is great.

27:28.167 --> 27:31.067
But did you expect
smoke on your butts hole?

27:31.067 --> 27:34.467
No, I never ever once thought
I'd ever get that.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.500
Kind of a bonus for you then,
huh, bud?

27:36.533 --> 27:37.533
Oh, you betcha.

27:39.867 --> 27:43.067
We've been hauling ass, bro.
Hauling ass.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.067
Now we're gonna haul ass
on getting some pay
to the plant,

27:45.100 --> 27:47.067
and then we're gonna haul ass
on running it,

27:47.067 --> 27:48.833
and then we're gonna haul ass
on cleaning it up

27:48.867 --> 27:50.667
and seeing if it's worth
running more.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.900
And, just to clarify,
we're gonna full-ass
the hauling ass?

27:53.933 --> 27:55.733
Not half-ass the hauling ass?

27:57.267 --> 27:58.333
We don't half-ass anything.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.700
[Rick] What do you say there,
guys?
That's the last load.

28:05.733 --> 28:07.533
Think we're ready
to rock and roll,
think this road's done.

28:09.667 --> 28:12.500
[Paul] Now,
for the 1,000 yard test.

28:13.933 --> 28:17.400
Krusey and Nathan
haul the pay across
the new bridge

28:17.433 --> 28:19.533
and then a mile
to the wash plant.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.933
[Rick] We're gonna run it
all today.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.833
If we run 1,000 yards,
if there's at least
10 ounces in it

28:24.867 --> 28:26.600
then that's gonna tell me
that it's worth running.

28:28.067 --> 28:30.967
We could be looking at
striking it [beep] rich here.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.633
-[Rick] Okay, you guys ready
to fire this thing up?
-[Chris speaking]

28:34.433 --> 28:35.400
All right, let's do it.

28:46.867 --> 28:48.267
We're loading the pile
with the excavator,

28:48.300 --> 28:49.733
the bucket on it's
about a yard of dirt,

28:49.767 --> 28:51.500
and he's dumping it
with every bucket.

28:51.533 --> 28:53.967
Um, he's doing about
100 buckets an hour.

28:54.067 --> 28:57.700
So, 10 hours we should
have our 1,000 yards run.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.133
I'm nervous, honestly, because

29:01.167 --> 29:05.200
if this works out
that's more of an opportunity
to get more gold this year.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.067
But if it's not,

29:07.100 --> 29:08.467
um, then it's just
a waste of time

29:08.500 --> 29:10.067
and time's not on our side
right now.

29:11.933 --> 29:15.233
[Paul] Ten hours,
and 1,000 yards of dirt later,

29:17.867 --> 29:19.933
Rick calls time on the test.

29:21.367 --> 29:22.667
A few pickers in there.

29:23.667 --> 29:25.200
Man it's tough to say,
I hate guessing.

29:31.267 --> 29:35.067
You know,
there's chunky gold in there,
there's fine gold.

29:35.067 --> 29:38.767
Uh! There's gold in it,
so it was the right decision
to run this.

29:41.067 --> 29:43.600
Let's get it out of the box,
get it across the table,
and see what we got.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.633
The test cleanup is done, um,
I'm dying to see the results.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.100
It cost me a day of stripping.

30:04.133 --> 30:07.533
But, you know what?
If the gold is good,
I'm gonna wanna run it.

30:07.567 --> 30:09.567
But I don't have Monster Red
setup.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.233
[Paul] At Duncan Creek

30:11.267 --> 30:14.900
it's time to see
if Rick's decision
to halt stripping

30:14.933 --> 30:17.200
and run a 1,000 yard test

30:17.233 --> 30:18.500
has paid off.

30:25.233 --> 30:26.733
-Hey, Heather.
-Hello.

30:27.867 --> 30:28.800
[Rick] Got it weighted up?

30:29.567 --> 30:30.867
You're gonna weigh it up.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.333
Oh, yeah,
you got it cleaned up, yeah.

30:33.367 --> 30:35.233
-I don't weigh it,
that's your job.
-Yeah.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.500
Ooh, feels kinda heavy.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.633
Ah, boy.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.700
This is a unique problem here.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.300
A unique problem
for a goldminer to have,
finding bonus gold.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.867
[Rick chuckles] Yeah.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.967
-Well, is it enough gold,
that's the problem.
-Oh, okay.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.633
-I know it sounds silly.
-What a terrible problem
for a goldminer.

30:53.667 --> 30:54.533
I know.

30:55.367 --> 30:56.967
Man, that's gonna be so close.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.800
-It looked good.
-Yeah.

30:58.833 --> 31:02.633
-For 1,000 yards.
-Looked pretty close
to what we've been doing.

31:02.667 --> 31:06.900
[Paul] To be worth running
the test must deliver
at least 10 ounces.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.233
Over 10.

31:23.233 --> 31:24.800
Holy [beep].

31:24.833 --> 31:25.933
It's over 14.

31:28.367 --> 31:30.433
14.02 ounces.

31:30.467 --> 31:33.133
That's just shy
of an ounce and a half
per 100 yards.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.800
I mean, that's just as good
as anything we've run
this year.

31:35.833 --> 31:38.567
Yeah, it's, uh, better than
it should have been

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
and what was supposed to be
overburden.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.267
-Whoo.
-So what are you gonna do?

31:43.233 --> 31:44.200
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

31:45.067 --> 31:46.767
Well, we can't throw it away.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.400
-No.
-Obviously.

31:48.433 --> 31:50.667
But I don't see...
I don't know how
we're gonna run it.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.100
I don't know how
we're gonna run it all.

31:52.133 --> 31:54.833
Well, I've got a lot
of decisions to make,
so, thanks Heather.

31:54.867 --> 31:55.767
You're welcome.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.733
[heavy exhale] Well,

32:01.667 --> 32:04.467
I've had worse problems,
I mean, I am holding
a pan of gold.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.467
But, uh, at the same time,
you know, this grounds good,

32:07.500 --> 32:10.067
but I know
what we're going for
at the bottom is better.

32:10.067 --> 32:12.500
Um, you know,
probably twice as good.

32:12.533 --> 32:16.067
[Paul] If Rick decides to run
this good pay dirt now,

32:16.067 --> 32:17.867
without Monster Red,

32:17.900 --> 32:21.233
he risks running out of time
to reach the super rich

32:21.267 --> 32:23.867
pay layer
at the bottom of Rally Valley.

32:24.467 --> 32:25.833
So,

32:25.867 --> 32:27.667
I can't throw this away,
I'm not set up to run it,

32:27.700 --> 32:28.833
I don't have
the time to run it,

32:28.867 --> 32:30.333
I don't have
the people to run it,
I don't have...

32:30.367 --> 32:32.167
I don't have everything, so.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.367
I've got a lot to figure out
right now

32:46.867 --> 32:51.333
Right now the pressure is on.
I'm firing on all cylinders,
we need 100 ounces.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.600
[Paul] At California Creek

32:54.633 --> 32:57.700
Fred's digging pay dirt
in the far end of the cut.

32:57.733 --> 33:00.667
The better we get
at this equipment,
the faster we're able to move.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.733
The faster we're able to put
pay dirt into the plant,

33:02.767 --> 33:04.133
the more gold
we're gonna go home with.

33:04.167 --> 33:08.067
So, efficiency,
efficiency, efficiency.

33:08.067 --> 33:10.367
[Paul] Longer sluices
on his wash plant

33:10.400 --> 33:15.100
mean he's supercharged
his operation to run 85 yards
an hour.

33:16.900 --> 33:19.567
It's all about
being successful
and about being efficient.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.400
Well, right now,
the name of the game is
get all the pay.

33:22.433 --> 33:25.400
[Paul] Scott sniper, Stuart,
feeds the hopper.

33:25.433 --> 33:28.867
I do think
that what the military
provided for us

33:28.900 --> 33:32.067
was the means to not quit.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.267
I definitely miss home.
I miss my family, immensely.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.733
But, uh,

33:36.767 --> 33:40.767
right now
this is where I need to be
to secure our future.

33:40.800 --> 33:46.067
[Paul] And Green Beret, Rick,
is on double duty
clearing tailings,

33:46.067 --> 33:51.467
Yeah, I'm jumping
from the rock truck
to e-ho and doing a self-load.

33:51.500 --> 33:56.733
And then turn around
and drive the truck back up,
dump it, come back down.

33:58.267 --> 34:00.967
That plant
can take a lot of pay.

34:01.067 --> 34:07.067
And, uh, we have been
busting our ass
to stay up with it.

34:07.100 --> 34:10.700
I'm jumping out now
and getting in the truck
and heading back around.

34:10.733 --> 34:14.067
If we ever did make it rich
off gold mining,

34:14.067 --> 34:16.200
then, uh,
we've definitely put
our dues in.

34:16.233 --> 34:20.067
Cause this season
has been one of the most
mentally tough things

34:20.067 --> 34:22.133
I've had to do in a very,
very long time.

34:26.467 --> 34:27.633
[loud bang]

34:29.267 --> 34:30.300
I've got a problem
with the plant.

34:32.067 --> 34:34.467
-Holy [beep]
-[Christopher]
Run old man, run.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.600
Okay, I'm shutting her down.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.867
Holy [beep],
I can see it from here.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.200
Tailings just got built up
too far.

34:45.233 --> 34:49.700
Caused the extra weight
in the sluice run,
and caused it to collapse.

34:49.733 --> 34:53.767
I was feeding,
I thought that everything
was, like, on point.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.067
I had no idea
that that was like that.

34:56.067 --> 34:57.167
[Rick] The new sluices

34:57.200 --> 34:59.533
are putting
more [beep] material
into the pond now.

34:59.567 --> 35:01.067
And it just added up.

35:01.067 --> 35:02.733
I couldn't get it out of there
faster enough.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.333
And it was nothing but
just try to sustain

35:05.367 --> 35:07.333
with me driving
the rock truck also.

35:08.933 --> 35:10.667
[Paul] Running twice
the pay dirt,

35:10.700 --> 35:14.400
has doubled the material
flowing through
the sluice runs.

35:14.433 --> 35:17.567
Cause the fine tailings
to quickly backup.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.600
And break the box
off the plant.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.700
[Rick] After it fell,
water kept flowing

35:25.467 --> 35:26.933
and any gold

35:26.967 --> 35:28.800
just right out the shoot
it goes.

35:28.833 --> 35:30.833
[JB] Yesterday,
all along that ridge,

35:30.867 --> 35:33.300
right here where
this gap is now,

35:33.333 --> 35:37.300
before it fell, there was just
a line of gold in there.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.133
It was, yeah,
it was beautiful.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.833
We could've easily lost four
or five ounces.

35:42.867 --> 35:46.067
[Stuart] Hopefully we can
get down in there and recover.

35:46.067 --> 35:48.133
I know not 100% lost, but,

35:48.167 --> 35:49.867
yeah, a good percentage
is gone.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.833
If Fred came down here
and saw this,
he would be [beep] pissed.

35:54.367 --> 35:56.800
Tensions are high right now,
it just [beep] sucks.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.767
To be out here...

35:58.800 --> 36:02.867
To have, you know,
the final stretch
of the season, and then

36:02.900 --> 36:05.067
something like this happen.

36:05.067 --> 36:07.500
I don't know,
had I seen it
I definitely would have

36:08.467 --> 36:09.867
adjusted.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.500
I'm gonna try to get a hold
of Fred to let him know
what's going on.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.167
-Fred, this is Chris.
-Go head.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.300
Something happened
down at the mine site.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.833
Rick and Stuart were feeding
the plant

36:22.867 --> 36:25.967
and the sluice box, basically,
just fell down.

36:27.500 --> 36:31.067
The person who was on tailings
wasn't cleaning up.

36:31.067 --> 36:32.867
And the person who was feeding

36:32.900 --> 36:35.067
didn't know
there wasn't someone
down there cleaning up.

36:35.067 --> 36:40.267
So the small tailings
were backing up into
the sluice boxes.

36:40.300 --> 36:44.133
And there was just
so much weight
on the sluice box

36:44.167 --> 36:46.933
that the sluice box fell down.

36:46.967 --> 36:50.900
So you're telling me
the wash plants currently
not in operation.

36:50.933 --> 36:53.900
Yeah, we did lose
a bunch of gold.

36:53.933 --> 36:57.067
I don't have [beep] time
to be over there right now,
I'm pulling pay.

36:57.067 --> 36:58.367
That's freakin' bush league.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.067
Make sure they clean up
everything that was split,

37:01.100 --> 37:03.167
repurpose it,
put it back in the pile,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.833
and fix everything they broke.

37:04.867 --> 37:06.967
-Got it?
-Roger that.

37:07.067 --> 37:08.867
[Fred] You know,
I totally get it,
these guys are tired.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.200
Mistakes will happen.

37:11.233 --> 37:15.567
But, that sluice box breaking
was a major malfunction
of communication on our team.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.100
I have a lot of standards
for my misfits.

37:18.133 --> 37:19.433
We need to be
better than that.

37:19.467 --> 37:23.567
You know,
that one mistake
cost us 10 grand, easy.

37:25.967 --> 37:27.733
I'll take full responsibility
for this.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.767
You know, I'm the most, uh,
senior person on the crew

37:30.800 --> 37:32.700
with the most experience
that was working.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.200
So, it's kinda on me.

37:34.233 --> 37:35.933
And this is a big deal.
You know what I mean?

37:35.967 --> 37:37.367
Like, you know,
in other operations

37:37.400 --> 37:40.267
that they're pulling
100-200 ounces,
you know, a cleanout.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.100
This would just be, you know,
pennies to them.

37:43.133 --> 37:44.500
But, to us it's not.

37:50.467 --> 37:53.667
[Paul] JB and Buzz
rehang the sluice box.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.533
[Buzz] Oh, yeah,
that looks good.

37:56.567 --> 37:59.300
[Paul] And Rick and Stuart
scoop up the tailings

37:59.333 --> 38:02.800
which are now full of the gold
they lost.

38:02.833 --> 38:06.400
[Rick] We're pulling
the fine tailings
from the tailings pond

38:06.433 --> 38:11.600
and recovering them and, um,
we'll run them back through
later on.

38:14.067 --> 38:16.600
[Fred] I've gotta let my guys
fix their own mistakes.

38:16.633 --> 38:20.300
I'm not here to micromanage,
I'm not here to baby anyone.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.100
I'm here to make miners
out of these guys

38:22.133 --> 38:25.867
and when you make a mistake,
you gotta [beep]
fix it yourself.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.467
[Paul] Four hours later,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.500
they're ready to fire up
the wash plant, again.

38:38.367 --> 38:39.567
Coming on!

38:42.633 --> 38:43.433
Whoo!

38:47.900 --> 38:48.867
[Fred] Good work, guys.

38:52.733 --> 38:54.867
We got them fixed.

38:54.900 --> 38:59.167
[Fred] I hope this is a lesson
to understand how much
we have to pay attention.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.200
All right, well,
we'll adjust fire as a team,

39:03.233 --> 39:04.933
we'll come together,
we'll have a meeting.

39:04.967 --> 39:08.133
We'll make sure
everybody understands,
when you're up there.

39:08.167 --> 39:11.067
-Talking to that guy.
-[Fred] And talking
to that guy.

39:12.633 --> 39:14.500
I think right now
you guys just keep it running

39:14.533 --> 39:16.800
and we won't make that mistake
ever again.

39:16.833 --> 39:18.733
Yep. Feed the beast, man.
Feed the beast.

39:19.933 --> 39:20.833
Good job.

39:33.633 --> 39:38.567
Gotta put her high-vis on.
She's on the claim official
so, safety first.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.467
[Paul] At California Creek

39:40.500 --> 39:44.567
Fred Lewis is training
the newest member
of the misfits crew.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.867
She's smelling for gold.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.400
Where's the gold?
Where is it?

39:49.433 --> 39:52.667
Shoeshine I want you to bark
for the positive one.

39:53.733 --> 39:55.967
Is it this one?
Or is it this one?

39:56.633 --> 39:58.267
Which one's positive?

39:58.300 --> 40:00.000
Come on, Shoeshine,
I just taught you this.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.133
-Is it red?
-[Shoeshine barks]

40:03.167 --> 40:05.433
-Just tell me,
how proud are you of yourself?
-[Shoeshine barks]

40:05.467 --> 40:09.267
How proud of you are yourself?
You know what negative
and positive is.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.900
Shoeshine,
you gonna run the loader?

40:10.933 --> 40:13.867
No. The dozer? Excavator?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.433
All right, Shoeshine,
let's go.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.833
You know, Shoeshine's 12.
They say you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.900
-Mine's driving an excavator.
-[Shoeshine barks]

40:23.933 --> 40:25.500
Good girl.

40:25.533 --> 40:28.800
Where you going? Take a nap?
All right,
I'll be over here working.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.167
[Rick] I got a lot of decision
to make.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.767
[Paul] Rick Ness
is facing a tough call.

40:45.800 --> 40:50.833
Run the new pay dirt
through his 100 yard an hour
wash plant, Rocky,

40:50.867 --> 40:54.767
Or wait until he can
run it through Monster Red--

40:54.800 --> 40:56.900
-[Rick] Hey, buddy.
-[Paul] ...three times faster.

40:56.933 --> 40:58.633
Is Brennan here?
Oh, yeah, there he is.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.567
[Chris] Good,
fashionably late.

41:01.433 --> 41:02.700
-Hey, buddy.
-[Brennan] How's it going?

41:02.733 --> 41:04.067
[Chris] Nice to see ya.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.100
[Rick] So I'm sure you guys
are probably wondering
how it went.

41:06.133 --> 41:07.667
[Brennan] Yeah,
what is the test.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.800
[Rick] 14 ounces
out of 1,000 yards.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.567
-That's 1.4 per hundo.
-That is.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.900
[beeping]

41:13.933 --> 41:15.567
That's north
of what we look for to run.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.200
[Brennan] So we're gonna
run that then?

41:17.233 --> 41:18.233
Actually, we're not.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.433
[Brennan] That sucks.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.067
That's better
than what we've been running
all year, though.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.133
-I know.
-And we haven't been sluicing
for how long?

41:28.900 --> 41:29.733
Few weeks.

41:31.233 --> 41:33.433
Just don't make sense
to run it right now, or...

41:33.467 --> 41:35.700
[Rick] No one wants to run
that dirt through the plant
more than I do.

41:35.733 --> 41:39.133
But, you know what I mean,
like, I have to get
Monster Red running.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.100
And it's gonna slow us down
if we run it.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.200
-We're just gonna
stock pile it.
-Okay.

41:43.233 --> 41:44.500
There's gonna be more gold
in the box

41:44.533 --> 41:46.200
-if we stick
to the original plan.
-Yeah.

41:46.233 --> 41:49.533
But, what we're going after
is down below, right.

41:49.567 --> 41:51.733
And that's better.
I know it is.

41:51.767 --> 41:54.400
We've got, what?
25-30 more feet to go?

41:54.433 --> 41:56.067
-Yeah, a couple lifts.
-[Rick] Yeah.

41:56.067 --> 41:57.233
[beep] get it.

41:57.267 --> 41:59.267
Yeah, it actually feels like
we're getting close, though.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.700
[Rick] I know.
Let's just keep going, man.
We're so close.

42:02.167 --> 42:03.500
-Right?
-Yep.

42:03.533 --> 42:05.133
[Nathan] Yep,
down to the bottom.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.900
Well, we've still got
a long ways to go,
so we should get at it.

42:07.933 --> 42:09.400
Yeah, get the night crew,
let's go.

42:09.433 --> 42:10.900
[Chris] That dirt's not gonna
move itself.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.733
All right, guys.
I think, um,

42:27.767 --> 42:30.067
this was definitely
a learning week for us.

42:30.067 --> 42:33.600
[Paul] After a week
of operator errors
and shut downs,

42:33.633 --> 42:36.400
the misfits are ready to weigh
the gold.

42:36.433 --> 42:39.233
The wash plant went down,
we lost our sluices.

42:39.267 --> 42:42.067
Um, I believe this gold weigh
is gonna reflect that.

42:42.067 --> 42:43.533
-Okay.
-But,

42:43.567 --> 42:46.667
I feel like the way
you guys came around that was
absolutely awesome.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.567
-Um, by the time I came,
you guys had it fixed.
-[Stuart] Yeah.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.200
[Fred] And I think we know now

42:51.233 --> 42:54.467
we gotta watch those sluices,
we gotta watch
that tailings pile.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.467
And it'll actually help us
work better as a team.

42:58.833 --> 43:01.533
[Paul] To hit their target
of 100 ounces,

43:01.567 --> 43:06.433
Fred's team needs
a weekly average
of around 10 ounces of gold.

43:06.467 --> 43:08.167
[Fred] All right, Rick.
You wanna call this one out?

43:08.200 --> 43:09.667
Uh, okay.

43:12.100 --> 43:13.333
All right, guys.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.067
You ready?

43:22.667 --> 43:26.633
[Rick] One, two, three, four,

43:27.867 --> 43:29.267
-five--
-[Fred] Come on, come on.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.967
-[Rick] six.
-[Fred] A-ha!

43:32.067 --> 43:34.067
-[Rick] Six.
-[Stuart] Six.

43:34.067 --> 43:37.233
-[Rick] 6.2, on the dot.
-[Fred] On the dot.

43:37.933 --> 43:41.067
[Paul] Worth nearly $11,000.

43:41.067 --> 43:44.067
But way below what they need
to reach their goal.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.533
So, guys that...

43:45.567 --> 43:47.433
I mean, if you look
at this you can tell,

43:47.467 --> 43:49.367
there aren't a lot
of heavies in here.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.367
It's mostly fine,
there's some chunks.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.700
Um, this represents
what we caught.

43:54.733 --> 43:57.400
I think what we lost
is about 3-4 ounces.

43:57.433 --> 44:00.933
I wouldn't say
this is a representation
of our ground, at all.

44:00.967 --> 44:02.900
This is just
the error we made.

44:02.933 --> 44:05.200
-[Rick] Right.
-[Fred] So.

44:05.233 --> 44:07.233
-[Stuart] That sucks.
-I don't wanna cry about it.

44:07.267 --> 44:08.500
Cause I still see
gold in the pan.

44:08.533 --> 44:10.500
And I still see us mining
and we're doing pretty well.

44:10.533 --> 44:13.067
So, we just need to not make
those mistakes again,
obviously.

44:13.100 --> 44:16.467
And we now know
that there are consequences
to our mistakes.

44:17.533 --> 44:19.467
Pretty [beep] big one.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.067
Is what it is.
We're gonna make mistakes.

44:21.100 --> 44:24.167
We're new, we're learning,
and we don't know
that wash plant.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.567
But I think we're fighting it.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.067
-[JB] We'll make it up.
-Yep. Yep, I feel like
we'll make it up.

44:29.767 --> 44:30.667
Definitely.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.333
Good to know
that I can rely on you guys

44:32.367 --> 44:35.233
to fix problems
when I'm not there,
kinda like a test.

44:35.267 --> 44:37.800
And you guys passed.
So, I really appreciate that.

44:37.833 --> 44:39.233
So, you guys are killing it.

44:39.267 --> 44:40.800
-[Stuart] Yeah.
-Be proud of that

44:40.833 --> 44:42.833
On that note,
back to work, guys.

44:49.933 --> 44:51.467
You know, right now,
I've got mixed emotions.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.300
I'm not happy about the amount
of gold we got.

44:53.333 --> 44:55.300
But I am ecstatic
about the team.

44:55.333 --> 44:56.833
We lost gold, yes.

44:56.867 --> 44:59.100
We could have lost
a hell of a lot more.

44:59.133 --> 45:00.367
They're proving themselves
as a team.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.800
They're proving
their learning.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.600
And they're proving
they have massive potential
to be gold miners.

45:03.633 --> 45:06.233
And Fred's, you know,
he's being a leader right now.

45:06.267 --> 45:08.900
And he understand
there's just no

45:08.933 --> 45:11.233
point in beating, you know,
a dead horse.

45:11.267 --> 45:14.800
Or whipping us even more.
We're already pretty down
on ourselves for it.

45:14.833 --> 45:16.500
So, we have to find more gold.

45:16.533 --> 45:19.800
You know, we gotta
get more pay
through the plant.

45:19.833 --> 45:22.900
Otherwise, you know,
this is all for nothing.

45:22.933 --> 45:25.700
I'll take the loss.
We'll move forward
and we'll fix our [beep].

45:26.467 --> 45:27.767
And won't let it happen again.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.233
[Minnie] Hi, guys.

45:40.267 --> 45:42.200
-Hi, family.
-How are ya?

45:43.900 --> 45:44.800
[Tony speaking]

45:45.700 --> 45:47.267
But wait! There's more.

45:48.533 --> 45:50.067
[Minnie] Don't scare me,
will ya.

45:50.900 --> 45:52.300
So, how was this week, guys?

45:55.333 --> 45:57.233
[Minnie] Did we sluice
all week, Mike?

45:57.267 --> 46:01.133
No, with the pay being so wet
and you can't shove it
through there.

46:01.833 --> 46:03.100
Kinda done with rain.

46:03.133 --> 46:04.567
How long were we down for?

46:07.567 --> 46:08.833
[Kevin] That sounds
about right, yeah.

46:17.933 --> 46:20.667
-Yep
-[Minnie] Anyways
and that's all piggybank gold.

46:20.700 --> 46:25.067
Seeing as we did sluice
and we did get some gold,
maybe somebody wants to weigh.

46:26.367 --> 46:28.100
-I think Faith should count.
-[Minnie] [chuckles] Faith.

46:31.533 --> 46:32.333
It's fine.

46:35.067 --> 46:39.567
[Paul] To stay on track
for his 4,500 ounces goal

46:39.600 --> 46:45.067
Tony needs his piggybank
to deliver 237 ounces of gold.

46:46.567 --> 46:47.600
-Ready?
-[Faith] Yep.

46:53.100 --> 46:54.633
40, 50,

46:54.667 --> 46:57.633
60, 70, 80, 90,

46:57.667 --> 47:00.900
110, 120, 130,

47:01.700 --> 47:03.767
140, 160,

47:04.367 --> 47:07.200
170, 190, 200.

47:09.067 --> 47:11.500
204.72.

47:11.533 --> 47:15.100
[Paul] Worth almost $370,000.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.300
That's pretty good
for us being shut down
for a couple days.

47:24.267 --> 47:26.767
That goes to show us
worth trying to get
that wet [beep] through.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.467
[Minnie] Really,
it's still okay.

47:34.233 --> 47:36.967
Oh, you know, arms toil,
least you know
it was worth it.

47:41.167 --> 47:44.067
[Paul] This brings
Tony's season gold total

47:44.067 --> 47:46.967
to 2,663 ounces.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.300
Still got a month
and a half left, so.

47:50.333 --> 47:53.067
-And we've been getting
fairly decent gold lately.
-Yes.

47:53.067 --> 47:57.633
So, I think the 4,500,
it should be doable.

47:57.667 --> 47:59.500
-Starting to look good, eh?
-[Minnie] Yeah.

48:00.567 --> 48:01.900
-You agree?
-[baby cooing]

48:01.933 --> 48:03.367
Okay then.

48:04.167 --> 48:05.400
Glad you do.
