00:22.304 --> 00:23.404
Morning...

00:27.675 --> 00:28.809
Morning bro.

00:35.949 --> 00:39.419
<i>University 2-1,</i>
<i>University 2-1...</i>

00:39.487 --> 00:41.121
Go for uni 2-1

00:41.188 --> 00:43.589
<i>Proceed to 499 Augusta at</i>
<i>College;</i>

00:43.657 --> 00:45.625
<i>possible cardiac arrest.</i>

00:45.692 --> 00:46.791
We're on the move.

00:50.497 --> 00:52.597
Did you get those pills?

00:52.665 --> 00:53.832
He was...

00:53.900 --> 00:55.034
Thank you.

00:55.101 --> 00:56.468
Nitro.

00:56.536 --> 00:58.003
When was the last time he
took these; do you know

00:58.071 --> 00:59.638
the last time?

00:59.705 --> 01:00.872
No, no, no, not so fast.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.240
Are you on any
other medications?

01:04.043 --> 01:05.609
Mr. [inaudible] doesn't
speak a word of English.

01:05.677 --> 01:06.877
Right, if he's on
something else and I give

01:06.945 --> 01:08.312
his nitro is BP
will plummet.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.348
Well then...

01:18.489 --> 01:19.456
Well?

01:19.524 --> 01:21.391
Didn't help.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.726
Sorry ma'am, this is
very, very important.

01:23.794 --> 01:26.029
Is your husband on any
other medications?

01:26.097 --> 01:28.065
Anything else?

01:28.132 --> 01:29.066
I don't know.

01:36.773 --> 01:37.806
Did you get something?

01:37.874 --> 01:40.042
Yeah, he's on the
little blue pill.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.410
Don't give away
his secret.

01:41.478 --> 01:42.811
The secret is hers.

01:42.879 --> 01:44.480
Let's get him out of here.

01:44.548 --> 01:46.582
Dispatch this is uni 2-1,
we have a stow and go.

01:46.649 --> 01:47.783
Patient is stable.

01:47.850 --> 01:49.585
ASA has been
administered. Over.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.787
So let me get this
straight, this guy is

01:52.854 --> 01:53.921
having a heart attack and
he just starts thinking

01:53.989 --> 01:55.290
about some stripper?

01:55.357 --> 01:56.958
Well she was beautiful.

01:57.025 --> 01:59.094
Well I guess if I had my life
flashing before my eyes I'd

01:59.161 --> 02:03.864
want to conjure up a nice set
of comforting memories...

02:03.932 --> 02:05.633
is that guy still alive
back there?

02:05.701 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, he's fine.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.373
Remember you asked me to look
into this Logan character?

02:13.441 --> 02:14.808
What did you get?

02:14.875 --> 02:16.577
Eighteen months ago this
Metro cop Charlie Marks

02:16.644 --> 02:18.112
gets shot and killed.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.046
Every big case that she
ever broke the same name

02:20.115 --> 02:22.215
keeps popping up
in the reports.

02:22.282 --> 02:23.716
Logan.

02:23.783 --> 02:26.185
Yeah, Capper...she lost
her life in the end trying

02:26.253 --> 02:27.453
to protect him.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.959
Seven cases; who knows
how many more he never

02:34.027 --> 02:35.561
surfaced in.

02:35.629 --> 02:37.029
And we're sure
he's a paramedic?

02:37.097 --> 02:39.264
Yeah, I mean apparently
a really good one.

02:39.332 --> 02:41.833
Records just have him
as an unpaid informant.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.468
I mean there's nothing to
say what he was bringing

02:43.536 --> 02:44.969
to the party.

02:45.037 --> 02:46.571
Could be he just
had a bamboozle.

02:46.639 --> 02:49.741
Maybe once or twice,
but case after case?

02:49.808 --> 02:51.143
Okay say he's the
paramedic who always

02:51.210 --> 02:54.012
wanted to be a crime
solving butt kicker.

02:54.079 --> 02:58.883
Could be his real skill is
just manipulation?

02:58.951 --> 03:01.552
Oh I hate it when an
informant says it's urgent.

03:01.620 --> 03:02.720
You want backup?

03:02.788 --> 03:06.290
No, keep going on Logan.

03:06.358 --> 03:10.261
I want to know if this guy
is the real deal... or if

03:10.328 --> 03:12.396
he's up to something.

03:33.317 --> 03:36.653
Thought I made it clear
the fewer meets the better.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.621
You gonna want to hear
this; it's about that

03:38.689 --> 03:40.022
gunrunner you've
been watching.

03:40.090 --> 03:42.825
What gunrunner?

03:42.893 --> 03:44.660
Peter Charlebois.

03:44.727 --> 03:46.094
What about him?

03:46.162 --> 03:49.331
Well he made your man and
judging by that look on

03:49.399 --> 03:52.467
your face I'd say I
just earned my pay.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.606
I suppose you have.

03:57.674 --> 04:00.174
It's always a pleasure doing
business with you sarge.

04:04.346 --> 04:06.681
Oh yeah sarge, I wouldn't
wait too long getting him

04:06.748 --> 04:09.550
out of there
if I were you.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
=== Sync by Alice ===
=== www.addic7ed.com ===

04:31.416 --> 04:33.217
Taking nitro and...

04:33.285 --> 04:35.285
Yeah wife's been slipping
it into his tea.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.385
Without him knowing?

04:36.453 --> 04:37.753
You go girl.

04:37.822 --> 04:38.721
You take this?

04:38.789 --> 04:41.324
Yeah.

04:42.259 --> 04:45.494
So beer, pizza,
what do you think?

04:45.562 --> 04:48.664
Oh I can't this week.

04:48.732 --> 04:49.965
I have plans.

04:50.033 --> 04:54.036
Yeah, is he that
neurosurgeon?

04:54.103 --> 04:57.940
Lawson... what is it?

04:58.942 --> 05:00.642
Are you doing the thing...
are you reading me...

05:00.710 --> 05:02.577
No, no, we know you well.

05:02.645 --> 05:05.447
We know you well.
I know you well.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.014
Oz, I think
he's caught on.

05:07.082 --> 05:09.683
Sandy, she kind of... everyone
knows what you're  to.

05:09.751 --> 05:11.685
Okay so maybe we are...
we're taking it slow..

05:11.753 --> 05:13.554
see where it goes.

05:13.621 --> 05:15.489
I don't know how quickly I want
to get back into a relationship.

05:15.557 --> 05:16.858
I know what you mean.

05:19.828 --> 05:21.395
I mean it's all coming
down the way we thought;

05:21.463 --> 05:23.196
shipments coming in.

05:23.264 --> 05:25.265
All these months are
finally going to pay off.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.102
Watch your step.

05:27.545 --> 05:30.813
Nick I have to
pull you out.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.984
Don't even joke about
something like that.

05:35.052 --> 05:36.385
I'm not joking.

05:36.453 --> 05:38.855
An informant has told me
that you've been made.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.823
You have a target
on your back.

05:40.891 --> 05:42.759
Come on Michelle; you know
how these informants work

05:42.826 --> 05:44.593
they tell you what you
want to here...

05:44.661 --> 05:45.761
It's Perry right?

05:45.828 --> 05:46.795
What do you even
pay that guy?

05:46.863 --> 05:48.230
That's not the point.

05:48.297 --> 05:49.464
No, the point is we're
this close to pulling off

05:49.531 --> 05:52.467
a bust you and I both
sweated blood for.

05:52.534 --> 05:55.003
This is the show right;
this is why we do what we do.

05:55.071 --> 05:57.806
If I wanted to play it safe
I wouldn't have become a cop.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.440
Trust me; I got this.

05:59.508 --> 06:00.941
I understand that but I'm not
going to let you risk your life.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.543
On a takedown like this
that's as good as it gets.

06:03.611 --> 06:07.648
So I am asking you,
do not do this.

06:08.817 --> 06:10.284
I'm sorry.

06:10.351 --> 06:11.886
Come on...that's it, I throw
away three and a half months

06:11.953 --> 06:15.389
of deep cover work on the
word of some crack head?

06:15.456 --> 06:17.157
Let me at least
get the drop site.

06:18.859 --> 06:21.828
Even if I'm not involved
you can make your move.

06:21.896 --> 06:24.297
And then you're
out of there.

06:25.032 --> 06:28.034
I know you're my boss and
everything but I'll never

06:28.102 --> 06:31.871
forget that you
dated my brother.

06:31.939 --> 06:33.638
No unnecessary risks.

06:33.706 --> 06:35.740
Damn, those are
my favorite kind.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.084
Cummings is bragging about
how he saved some window

06:46.152 --> 06:47.853
washer that was stuck
like 20 stories up.

06:47.921 --> 06:49.253
You did that once right?

06:49.321 --> 06:51.488
Yeah... first year, high rise.

06:51.556 --> 06:52.723
I still have this thing
about extreme heights;

06:52.791 --> 06:54.692
I'm good as long as I
don't look down.

06:54.759 --> 06:55.893
You know what; I couldn't
have done that without

06:55.961 --> 06:57.061
my best friend.

06:58.697 --> 07:00.264
Adrenalin.

07:00.332 --> 07:03.434
To adrenalin.

07:03.501 --> 07:06.169
So what, are you guys
like danger junkies?

07:06.237 --> 07:07.637
Sorry, I overheard.

07:07.705 --> 07:08.905
No, no, that's okay.

07:08.973 --> 07:11.574
Yes, yes we are
danger junkies.

07:11.642 --> 07:12.909
Yeah.

07:12.977 --> 07:16.012
Me too; anything that
gets my heart pumping.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.383
We're EMS actually, so...
danger is my middle name.

07:20.451 --> 07:23.785
It's pronounced Dunhair
but it's speeded like danger.

07:23.854 --> 07:25.587
Toby... Oz and...

07:25.655 --> 07:26.621
Phoebe.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.090
Phoebe.

07:28.158 --> 07:29.925
Phoebe, I'm so curious,
Phoebe, what's....

07:29.993 --> 07:31.626
what gets your heart pumping.

07:31.694 --> 07:32.895
A bunch of things.

07:32.963 --> 07:37.332
Free climbing; sky
diving, motorcycles.

07:37.399 --> 07:40.034
You ever repel down a
thousand foot cliff?

07:40.102 --> 07:42.670
For breakfast.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.008
You ever ski down a
mountain  on your bum?

07:47.076 --> 07:49.610
Not intentionally, no

07:52.514 --> 07:54.447
I have to go number one.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.515
Excuse me.

07:55.549 --> 07:57.918
Sure.

08:03.324 --> 08:05.492
You ever surf a
tropical storm?

08:05.559 --> 08:09.762
You ever hang from
a chopper ski?

08:09.829 --> 08:11.430
Where do you draw the
line; what to you would be

08:11.498 --> 08:13.199
just too crazy?

08:13.267 --> 08:15.834
Too crazy... too crazy
would be leaving without

08:15.903 --> 08:17.370
your number.

08:25.878 --> 08:28.646
Risk assessment manager.

08:28.714 --> 08:31.082
Girl's got to
make a living.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.525
You sure Nick's been made?

08:41.592 --> 08:42.993
That's the problem;
I'm not sure.

08:43.061 --> 08:44.995
But how can I
take the chance.

08:45.063 --> 08:47.431
Four months, nearly
200,000 stand a chance to

08:47.498 --> 08:50.167
intercept God knows how many
guns built for body count.

08:50.235 --> 08:52.002
That's a quote,
unquote on somebody.

08:52.070 --> 08:53.470
You think I like this?

08:53.538 --> 08:55.039
If you pull Nick on the
eve of this thing you'll

08:55.106 --> 08:57.773
be losing any advantage
you have; that's if the

08:57.841 --> 08:59.309
deal even goes down.

08:59.376 --> 09:00.843
Pierre has to go
through with it.

09:00.911 --> 09:03.379
If word got out that he
bailed because a cop was

09:03.447 --> 09:06.649
inside his operation
it wouldn't be good.

09:06.716 --> 09:08.651
We're still drawing blanks
on the bar... what is it...

09:08.718 --> 09:10.186
Loutier?

09:10.254 --> 09:11.587
We know nothing about him;
where he's from, what he

09:11.655 --> 09:13.488
looks like, if that is
even his real name.

09:13.556 --> 09:16.391
Exchange is the only chance
we may have to grab him.

09:16.459 --> 09:19.294
That's my point exactly.

09:19.362 --> 09:22.097
You could be pulling the plug
based on faulty intelligence.

09:22.165 --> 09:26.101
At the very least you
have to corroborate it.

09:29.338 --> 09:31.472
I might have an idea.

09:42.951 --> 09:44.651
Morning Mr. Logan.

09:44.719 --> 09:46.119
Hey.

09:46.187 --> 09:48.154
What are you doing
in my neighborhood?

09:48.222 --> 09:49.555
Your eyes are a
little bloodshot;

09:49.623 --> 09:52.492
did you have a rough night?

09:52.559 --> 09:54.560
Have you been
following me?

09:54.628 --> 09:57.364
I was hoping we could
have a little chat...

09:57.431 --> 10:01.666
I brought coffee and
bear claws.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.337
So what is it that you
want Sergeant?

10:05.405 --> 10:10.442
I would like to know
the truth about you.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.644
You must have
access to my file.

10:12.712 --> 10:16.148
I do but it doesn't
answer all my questions.

10:16.216 --> 10:20.251
Okay I would help
Charlie out on cases.

10:20.319 --> 10:24.122
I would read facial
expressions,

10:24.189 --> 10:26.391
body language,
things like that.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.159
So you're a face reader.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.328
If you want to
call it that, yeah.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.563
So two weeks ago with that
amnesia victim how did

10:32.631 --> 10:34.364
you know so much
about that case?

10:34.432 --> 10:36.366
You'd be amazed at what
the face gives away.

10:36.434 --> 10:37.367
Yeah?

10:37.435 --> 10:38.868
Yeah.

10:38.936 --> 10:41.405
Well amaze me.

10:41.472 --> 10:42.406
No, no, this is bogus.

10:42.473 --> 10:44.441
Then prove me wrong.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.743
Oh, let's just...
I don't, no...

10:46.810 --> 10:48.178
Oh come on, I'm just going
to be back with more

10:48.246 --> 10:50.579
questions and you know
what, next time there

10:50.647 --> 10:54.383
won't be any coffee
or bear claws.

10:54.451 --> 10:57.986
Not the bear claws.

10:58.055 --> 11:00.122
What do you see
when you look at me?

11:00.190 --> 11:03.259
I see uh... I see...

11:03.326 --> 11:04.493
easy on the eyes.

11:07.163 --> 11:10.965
What does my
expression tell you?

11:11.033 --> 11:13.901
<i>If he's</i>
<i>for real I can use him.</i>

11:13.969 --> 11:18.406
If I'm telling the truth
you might be able to use me.

11:18.474 --> 11:20.075
It's too obvious.

11:20.142 --> 11:25.245
All right... what is the most
important thing on your mind?

11:26.514 --> 11:29.883
<i>I can't let</i>
<i>anything happen to Nick.</i>

11:29.951 --> 11:31.051
You're thinking about
somebody who is close to

11:31.119 --> 11:34.254
you that you're
worried about.

11:34.322 --> 11:35.956
You got that from
my expression?

11:36.023 --> 11:39.692
Mmm, micro-expressions;
like your nose,

11:39.759 --> 11:41.927
your eyes, in your
mouth... they do all these

11:41.995 --> 11:45.565
funny little things and you
start to bring it altogether.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.233
To be honest I make it
up most of the time...

11:47.301 --> 11:50.002
it's not magic.

11:53.739 --> 11:55.840
Yeah, uh...next time you
want a word with me just

11:55.908 --> 11:58.776
give me a call.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.352
That was fast.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.820
Mr. Logan...

12:08.887 --> 12:10.221
Toby; you can
call me Toby.

12:10.288 --> 12:13.924
Okay Toby, I'm going
to be honest with you.

12:13.992 --> 12:18.762
I'm in a real bind and I
would like to try out this

12:18.830 --> 12:20.797
face reading
things of yours.

12:50.449 --> 12:52.182
I hope this is worth
the trip.

12:52.250 --> 12:56.654
You're going to be very
happy Mr. Loutier.

13:06.464 --> 13:10.066
M203 grenade launcher,
as promised.

13:10.133 --> 13:13.736
Takes out doors, windows,
bunkers, slices onions

13:13.803 --> 13:17.606
without tears.

13:17.674 --> 13:19.842
And you have all
four hundred pieces?

13:19.909 --> 13:22.043
That and more.

13:22.111 --> 13:24.380
And we're on
for 1500 hours?

13:24.447 --> 13:26.982
You'll get a text
with the details.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.001
Okay here we are.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.568
Where is here?

13:48.636 --> 13:51.138
Inside there's a guy in a
baseball cap talking to a

13:51.206 --> 13:52.940
guy in a leather jacket.

13:53.008 --> 13:54.108
I want you to tell me
what's going on between

13:54.175 --> 13:55.742
the two of them.

13:55.810 --> 13:58.312
Okay, it's a big vague.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.446
It's an undercover
operation; I can't tell

13:59.514 --> 14:00.547
you anymore than that.

14:00.615 --> 14:01.681
I'm sorry.

14:01.749 --> 14:04.250
All right, wish me luck.

14:29.842 --> 14:31.910
Hey.

14:31.978 --> 14:34.145
Nick's camera is
transmitting nicely.

14:38.250 --> 14:41.285
The newb has landed.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.123
Can I grab a coffee?

14:46.191 --> 14:48.125
Yeah.

14:49.494 --> 14:51.061
Figure the guys
busting my chops so

14:51.128 --> 14:54.097
I throw down and tell him
his wife's on the hefty side.

14:54.165 --> 14:58.034
Think I might have called
her a mini cooper in drag.

14:58.102 --> 14:59.635
That's real
thrilling to hear.

14:59.703 --> 15:01.838
You're lucky he didn't
smoke you on the spot.

15:01.905 --> 15:03.606
So what's the timing
on this thing?

15:03.674 --> 15:04.975
I mean you want me to
divert Port security

15:05.042 --> 15:06.741
I need to know when.

15:06.809 --> 15:08.743
There's no rush bro, we'll
get our marching orders,

15:08.811 --> 15:10.346
you'll get yours.

15:10.413 --> 15:12.281
<i>Like I'm</i>
<i>freaking going to tell you.</i>

15:12.349 --> 15:14.516
Swear to god these eggs are
going to kill me one day.

15:14.584 --> 15:17.386
<i>It won't be
the eggs that get you cop.</i>

15:19.089 --> 15:22.890
<i>Change of plans, Port's out,
new drop site, Royal.</i>

15:24.393 --> 15:25.893
Gonna eat that?

15:25.961 --> 15:28.629
Be my guest.

15:28.697 --> 15:31.265
<i>Like taking
bacon from a pig, right cop?</i>

15:46.614 --> 15:47.847
He knows your
guy's a cop.

15:47.915 --> 15:50.450
You got this from
reading his face?

15:50.518 --> 15:52.185
You want me to
prove that again?

15:52.253 --> 15:55.021
Your guy's in
serious danger.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.197
I didn't get the drop
site but I'm close.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.899
Well close isn't
good enough.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.967
What; you're really going
to 86 the operation on

16:09.036 --> 16:10.435
what Perry told you?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.202
It's not just him; I have
someone else telling me

16:11.270 --> 16:12.670
the same thing.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.739
Sorry I'm late.

16:14.806 --> 16:18.343
Nick this is Toby Logan;
he does behavioral

16:18.411 --> 16:19.344
analysis for us.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.745
Behavioral what?

16:20.812 --> 16:23.214
Face reading.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.615
No kidding.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.317
He observed you and
Pierre this morning.

16:27.385 --> 16:28.419
What the hell would you
sent someone over without

16:28.486 --> 16:30.020
telling me for?

16:30.088 --> 16:32.122
He confirms what my
informant has been saying.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.591
Yeah?

16:34.659 --> 16:38.462
And how did you do that?

16:38.530 --> 16:39.996
It's a little art;
it's a little science.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.098
I mean your face
is saying things even

16:42.166 --> 16:43.166
when your lips aren't.

16:43.233 --> 16:44.200
But are you even a cop?

16:44.268 --> 16:45.734
No.

16:45.802 --> 16:48.204
Do you really want to take
a chance that I'm wrong?

16:48.272 --> 16:50.273
It's your life man.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.674
So what did you see man;
you see a little tic,

16:51.741 --> 16:53.342
a twitch or something?

16:53.410 --> 16:54.743
Well it's not that simple.

16:54.811 --> 16:56.179
Oh no, of course not
because then you'd have to

16:56.246 --> 16:59.047
explain it and no
one would hire you.

16:59.115 --> 17:00.415
I'm going on
my gut as well.

17:00.483 --> 17:02.350
We walk away from this
we lose everything.

17:02.418 --> 17:04.185
I understand that Nick but
I can't take the risk.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.253
If something is going
to happen to you...

17:06.321 --> 17:08.723
It's calculated risk.

17:08.790 --> 17:12.026
It's what we're
trained to accept.

17:12.095 --> 17:13.962
Well this is
taking it too far.

17:16.864 --> 17:18.365
It's over, I'm sorry.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.166
We're going to figure
this out some other way.

17:26.508 --> 17:28.275
I'm not happy about
this; you know that.

17:28.343 --> 17:30.643
I know that.

17:42.123 --> 17:43.756
So what did you
tell Sgt. McCluskey?

17:43.824 --> 17:46.025
I told her I get it from facial
expressions, body language.

17:46.093 --> 17:47.392
And she believed you?

17:47.460 --> 17:48.693
Yeah.

17:48.761 --> 17:49.794
You think you'll
actually ever tell her?

17:49.862 --> 17:52.831
That I'm a
telepath... uh...

17:52.898 --> 17:55.000
I don't know if I want
to go down that road again.

17:55.067 --> 17:58.770
<i>University 2-1... University 2-1...</i>
<i>....24-year-old male in</i>

17:58.838 --> 18:01.473
<i>distress, Bathurst</i>
<i>and Wellington.</i>

18:01.541 --> 18:03.608
Uni 2-1, we're on
it thank you, copy.

18:06.512 --> 18:07.578
Get in the car.

18:07.646 --> 18:08.646
What the hell is going on?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.114
Get in the car and drive.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.423
How'd
Nick take it?

18:27.490 --> 18:29.091
Like you'd expect.

18:29.159 --> 18:30.859
It's not like the whole
thing's been a waste.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.828
Well it still doesn't
make it any easier.

18:33.896 --> 18:36.498
I'm sorry to barge in but we
got a situation on our hands.

18:36.566 --> 18:37.933
What's going on?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.633
Pierre slipped our tail
about twenty minutes ago.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.035
What do you mean slipped?

18:41.103 --> 18:43.171
A real pro job; used a
transport to block an

18:43.238 --> 18:44.672
alley and cut off our car.

18:44.739 --> 18:46.839
You got guys sitting on
his known associates?

18:46.907 --> 18:48.375
No, they all
vanished... like that.

18:48.443 --> 18:51.244
This is a very
coordinated plan.

18:51.312 --> 18:53.012
Well they've got
to be somewhere.

18:53.081 --> 18:56.149
I've checked all the known
frequents but there's nothing.

18:56.217 --> 18:58.385
Let's get Nick on the line;
maybe he has some ideas.

18:58.453 --> 19:00.087
I'm getting something.

19:00.154 --> 19:01.287
What is it?

19:01.354 --> 19:04.823
Michelle, Nick
sent you an email.

19:04.891 --> 19:07.759
Sorry Michelle, gone too
far to turn back now.

19:09.829 --> 19:11.564
How could he
be so stubborn.

19:11.631 --> 19:12.931
He's not answering
his cell.

19:12.999 --> 19:15.401
Pierre's gone to ground;
could they have him?

19:15.469 --> 19:17.102
I want every resource we
have out there trying to

19:17.203 --> 19:18.303
find these guys.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.670
It's already in motion.

19:19.738 --> 19:21.306
We do everything we
can to find Nick.

19:23.642 --> 19:26.478
Hello?

19:32.418 --> 19:33.917
It's Nick?

19:33.985 --> 19:36.686
They found him, he's being
transported to St. Luke's.

19:39.056 --> 19:40.924
This our guy caught in
a man-eating sofa?

19:40.992 --> 19:43.360
Pinched artery, possible
deep tissue damage.

19:43.428 --> 19:45.195
Put him in number 3.

19:45.263 --> 19:46.597
Can you take this in?

19:46.664 --> 19:48.798
Yes.

19:53.670 --> 19:54.970
How is he?

19:55.038 --> 19:56.939
It's not good.

19:57.007 --> 19:58.841
Tell me he's
going to make it.

19:58.908 --> 20:00.809
They are prepping
the OR right now.

20:00.877 --> 20:03.112
It's best if
you wait here.

20:06.616 --> 20:09.451
Sgt. McCluskey?

20:11.086 --> 20:13.755
They um...

20:13.822 --> 20:16.591
...they just shot him in
the head and left him in

20:16.659 --> 20:18.826
the parking lot to die.

20:29.304 --> 20:32.739
Whatever it takes I
want Pierre found.

20:32.807 --> 20:34.575
There's still a
deal going down.

20:36.344 --> 20:39.078
I'm going to stay here
until he's out of surgery.

20:39.146 --> 20:41.881
Let me know the minute
you get anything.

20:41.948 --> 20:43.783
Hi.

20:44.818 --> 20:47.787
Is there anything
I can do?

20:47.854 --> 20:49.121
No.

20:49.190 --> 20:52.124
You... you did everything
that you could.

20:52.193 --> 20:54.426
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>who should have done something.</i>

20:54.494 --> 20:57.095
Don't beat yourself up.

21:02.468 --> 21:04.703
The surgeon would like
to speak with you.

21:33.431 --> 21:38.235
Time, two... game point,
here we go.

21:48.614 --> 21:51.780
Toby it's not your fault anymore
than it was Sgt McCluskey's.

21:51.848 --> 21:53.482
You told her
everything you could.

21:53.550 --> 21:55.784
I told her the guy was
going to be in trouble,

21:55.852 --> 21:58.185
he was in danger and look
he's in the hospital now.

21:58.254 --> 22:00.521
You told her his life was
in danger, yes, but that

22:00.589 --> 22:02.857
information didn't
get him shot.

22:02.924 --> 22:06.060
I didn't tell her about
the text message I saw

22:06.128 --> 22:10.030
the guy get that said
'change of plans'.

22:10.098 --> 22:11.566
Now how am I going to say
I got that from reading

22:11.634 --> 22:14.501
his face?

22:14.569 --> 22:16.703
If it were me I
would just tell her.

22:16.771 --> 22:18.171
I mean what's the worst
thing she could do to me?

22:18.239 --> 22:19.873
She could say
'you're a nut job'.

22:19.940 --> 22:22.442
I'm a nut job, so what?

22:22.510 --> 22:25.612
Well last time I told a cop
that worked out well didn't it?

22:55.308 --> 22:57.375
Not so easy
being a hero huh?

22:57.443 --> 23:01.145
So Det. Marks you're here to
investigate the accident?

23:06.918 --> 23:10.153
You know what
I'm thinking.

23:29.105 --> 23:30.707
<i>If it were me I</i>
<i>would just tell her.</i>

23:30.774 --> 23:33.042
<i>I mean what's the worst</i>
<i>thing she could do to me.</i>

23:45.806 --> 23:47.374
<i>Hi I can't</i>
<i>take your call right now;</i>

23:47.442 --> 23:48.942
<i>please leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

23:50.211 --> 23:53.413
Hey, um... Michelle,
it's Toby.

23:53.481 --> 23:57.184
Just I'm at the hospital
here I was hoping you

23:57.252 --> 24:01.387
could meet me, just
want to maybe tell you

24:01.455 --> 24:06.960
something I've been
thinking about.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.429
Anyway... yes,

24:10.497 --> 24:13.867
...come and meet me at the
hospital if you can.

24:34.787 --> 24:36.988
Hey, how you doing?

24:37.056 --> 24:40.925
I'm a paramedic, just dropping
off a few personal items.

24:40.993 --> 24:42.293
Thank you.

25:01.813 --> 25:05.681
Nick...

25:05.749 --> 25:07.016
I'm Toby.

25:07.084 --> 25:09.351
I work with the IIB.

25:09.419 --> 25:13.522
Sgt McCluskey, everyone at the IIB,
they want to get those bad guys

25:13.523 --> 25:16.291
as much as you do.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.766
Shouldn't even be here.

25:29.871 --> 25:33.907
Look I...

25:33.975 --> 25:35.643
I'm sorry because
I think I could have done

25:35.711 --> 25:39.413
more to warn you and I
think it could have went

25:39.481 --> 25:43.617
down a lot differently.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.524
Stay strong man.

26:08.941 --> 26:15.880
<i>Have to tell them...</i>

26:38.102 --> 26:40.203
<i>End it.</i>

26:41.739 --> 26:43.540
Oh my god.

26:43.608 --> 26:45.542
What are you
doing in here?

26:45.610 --> 26:49.144
I was just... I was
checking in on him.

26:49.212 --> 26:52.080
What do you mean
checking in on him?

26:52.148 --> 26:54.350
There's things I know
about his shooting;

26:54.418 --> 26:55.751
details you need to hear.

26:55.819 --> 26:57.820
I know who was there,
I know who shot him.

26:57.887 --> 26:59.588
I know it's going to
sound crazy because he's

26:59.656 --> 27:01.990
in a coma but
I got it from him.

27:02.058 --> 27:04.826
What are you talking about?

27:04.893 --> 27:08.062
All right, I guess there's
no other way to say it,

27:08.130 --> 27:13.234
but I just...I have to
tell you that I...

27:13.302 --> 27:20.474
I don't read faces;

27:20.542 --> 27:27.314
I read minds.

27:27.382 --> 27:28.915
Look, okay, I'm
telling you the truth.

27:28.983 --> 27:32.386
Why do you think Charlie
used me on all those cases?

27:32.454 --> 27:34.421
This is insane;
you need to go now.

27:34.489 --> 27:36.021
Okay then how do you think
I know all that stuff in

27:36.089 --> 27:38.424
the amnesia case; you even
said it was impossible.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.426
Don't you dare use me
to back up this crap.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.161
Just let me prove
it to you all right.

27:42.229 --> 27:43.629
Pick a number.

27:43.697 --> 27:44.797
<i>Screw this</i>
<i>freak. Brown.</i>

27:44.865 --> 27:47.500
Brown is not a number.

27:47.568 --> 27:49.802
All right there's no use
trying to fight it because

27:49.870 --> 27:53.271
it just means I have to work
harder to prove it to you.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.906
<i>This</i>
<i>is crazy I have to...</i>

27:54.974 --> 27:56.475
Go tell Dev...

27:56.542 --> 27:59.845
...that I'm bogus, look,
just... just pick a number.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.446
84 birthday.

28:01.514 --> 28:04.483
84, someone's birthday

28:04.550 --> 28:05.684
What
<i>the hell is this?</i>

28:05.752 --> 28:07.085
This is me reading your mind.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.386
No this
<i>is not happening.</i>

28:08.453 --> 28:10.855
This is happening
right now.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.124
I can read all
your thoughts.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.425
<i>It's not possible.</i>

28:14.493 --> 28:21.099
This is possible and I
know it's scary...

28:21.166 --> 28:23.534
but you can get used to it.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.202
Charlie got used to it.

28:25.270 --> 28:28.438
You need
to stop it; stop it.

28:28.506 --> 28:31.474
I'm reading your mind
like I read Nick's.

28:45.688 --> 28:47.689
Don't let this whole
operation and what

28:47.757 --> 28:49.525
happened to
Nick be in vain.

28:49.592 --> 28:53.429
Let me help you.

28:53.496 --> 28:57.966
You're too good of a
cop not to see this.

29:03.139 --> 29:05.506
I want you to tell me
everything you know.

29:09.178 --> 29:11.479
Want a coffee?

29:11.547 --> 29:14.982
Two sugars, right?

29:30.797 --> 29:33.466
You can't actually believe
this guy's a psychic?

29:33.533 --> 29:34.800
He was inside my mind.

29:34.868 --> 29:37.003
No, he appeared to
be inside your mind.

29:37.071 --> 29:38.404
There's a million ways he
could have done it and

29:38.472 --> 29:40.974
it's all head games;
power of suggestion...

29:41.041 --> 29:44.376
Yeah or he could have
just read my mind.

29:44.444 --> 29:45.444
Maybe that Metro cop,
Charlie Marks, maybe

29:45.511 --> 29:47.812
she believed the same thing.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.248
Well let's put
him to the test.

29:50.316 --> 29:51.984
Yeah, that mind you said
he read...well you've

29:52.051 --> 29:54.386
officially lost it, okay.

29:58.091 --> 30:00.424
I thought I was
looking at mug shots.

30:00.492 --> 30:03.727
No we want you to create a
mug shot, it's like a

30:03.795 --> 30:05.896
high tech version of
Mr. Potato Head.

30:05.964 --> 30:08.866
Okay, all right,
how do we begin?

30:08.933 --> 30:10.301
Think about the gunman.

30:10.369 --> 30:12.169
Start real general.

30:12.237 --> 30:17.107
Uh, white male,
early fifties.

30:17.174 --> 30:18.941
You got to pick the
best matches okay.

30:19.010 --> 30:21.944
Look at the shapes.

30:22.013 --> 30:23.146
Okay...

30:23.214 --> 30:26.616
uhh... here.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.553
This guy here.

30:33.189 --> 30:34.589
Okay. What about hair?

30:34.657 --> 30:38.994
Hair, uhhh.... gray,
short, thinning.

30:39.062 --> 30:40.129
Shorter than that.

30:40.196 --> 30:41.663
Shorter.

30:41.731 --> 30:43.332
It's pretty good.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.401
Really good.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.702
How about eyes?

30:47.770 --> 30:50.405
Eyes...

30:50.472 --> 30:53.441
this...

30:54.410 --> 30:56.844
yeah, good.

30:56.912 --> 30:58.212
Nose?

30:59.014 --> 31:00.481
Here we go...

31:04.218 --> 31:06.286
That's the guy.

31:06.354 --> 31:07.654
You sure?

31:07.721 --> 31:10.690
Yeah, just tweak his ears
and a little bit and

31:10.758 --> 31:12.526
that's your Mr.
Potato head.

31:12.593 --> 31:16.229
All right.

31:16.297 --> 31:18.398
Wow that's cool.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.868
Wow, that's him.

31:22.936 --> 31:24.170
Wow.

31:24.237 --> 31:27.739
All right, uh, Theo Sheridan.

31:27.807 --> 31:31.210
Known associates include
one Pierre Charlebois.

31:31.278 --> 31:33.245
There's no way you could
have seen him before.

31:33.313 --> 31:35.214
I didn't, Nick did.

31:35.282 --> 31:36.448
He was the triggerman?

31:36.515 --> 31:38.583
Yeah, at Pierre's request.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.219
There must be something
Theo's wanted on.

31:41.287 --> 31:44.556
Yeah, yeah it seems that
he missed a parole officer

31:44.623 --> 31:45.557
meeting not too long ago.

31:45.624 --> 31:46.591
That'll work.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.796
Yeah?

31:54.732 --> 31:57.401
I understand.

31:57.469 --> 31:58.969
Thank you.

32:20.290 --> 32:27.195
Miss [inaudibe], Ruth, yeah,
It's Michelle McCluskey.

32:27.263 --> 32:32.867
Listen I am so sorry to
have to tell you this.

32:32.935 --> 32:37.172
Nick didn't make it.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.307
No, the doctors they did
everything that they

32:39.375 --> 32:42.909
possibly could.

32:48.350 --> 32:52.219
Please give my condolences
to Frank and Roger.

33:06.469 --> 33:07.668
Theo Sheridan?

33:07.736 --> 33:09.837
Says my name.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.474
Bringing you in on
a parole violation.

33:12.541 --> 33:16.910
Since when does IIB do
that kind of crap, huh?

33:18.279 --> 33:19.179
It will give us a chance
to talk about

33:19.247 --> 33:20.981
Nick [inaudible]'s murder.

33:25.686 --> 33:27.687
If you want to communicate with
the Sgt. just speak in a normal

33:27.755 --> 33:33.226
tone and if you are reading
minds feel free to share.

33:33.293 --> 33:34.327
<i>You may</i>
<i>have fooled her;</i>

33:34.394 --> 33:35.694
<i>you're not fooling me.</i>

33:35.762 --> 33:37.029
I'm not fooling around
Corporal, so...

33:44.605 --> 33:46.539
According to your parole
officer you crossed into

33:46.607 --> 33:48.007
the States last week.

33:48.074 --> 33:49.942
That's my job;
I'm a food buyer.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.710
What else were you buying?

33:51.778 --> 33:54.479
I stopped into
an Armani outlet.

33:54.547 --> 33:58.550
Could have fooled me; I'll
tell you what you were doing.

33:58.618 --> 34:01.286
Arranged to sell a shipment
of high-powered guns to a

34:01.354 --> 34:03.255
man named Loutier.

34:11.664 --> 34:14.533
<i>It was a red</i>
<i>shipment container.</i>

34:14.600 --> 34:17.902
We know the guns are in a
red shipping container.

34:17.969 --> 34:19.735
Where's the
shipment coming in.

34:19.804 --> 34:21.572
Shipment?

34:21.639 --> 34:23.206
Oh you mean the
California oranges?

34:23.275 --> 34:25.942
No Theo, I mean the
badass guns.

34:26.010 --> 34:29.079
Screw you; I ain't saying
another thing until I get

34:29.147 --> 34:32.516
a lawyer here.

34:33.552 --> 34:35.351
We know you shot Nick.

34:35.418 --> 34:37.753
Nick? I don't know no Nick.

34:44.328 --> 34:46.563
First I'm going to find
those guns and then I'm

34:46.630 --> 34:52.034
going to nail you for
Nick [inaudible]'s murder.

34:54.437 --> 34:58.174
That I promise you Theo.

35:00.476 --> 35:05.280
This may be all we
get; [inaudible] truck.

35:05.348 --> 35:06.916
Did you see anything else?

35:06.983 --> 35:08.382
We need something.

35:08.450 --> 35:10.018
We checked Theo's apartment
and came up empty.

35:10.086 --> 35:12.020
There was a...

35:15.357 --> 35:17.625
...there was a tag on
the container lock.

35:17.693 --> 35:21.162
Maybe a custom's seal?

35:21.230 --> 35:23.431
Any of these?

35:23.498 --> 35:26.033
Yeah, that one
right there.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.036
They use them on
cargo containers.

35:29.104 --> 35:30.503
Which one?

35:30.571 --> 35:32.840
Who knows how many of
those come in a day?

35:32.907 --> 35:35.242
I didn't know how to tell
you this before; I didn't

35:35.309 --> 35:38.178
think you'd believe me,
but the coffee shop,

35:38.246 --> 35:41.547
Pierre got a text he
said Port Town Royal.

35:41.615 --> 35:43.149
Port Town Royal?

35:43.217 --> 35:45.417
I don't know if that helps.

35:46.286 --> 35:49.922
Yeah, according to customs
a shipment of, get this,

35:49.990 --> 35:53.192
pineapples, came into the
country at Fort Erie and

35:53.260 --> 35:57.396
was due to arrive an hour
ago at the Royal cargo yard.

35:57.464 --> 35:59.598
Call you when I get there.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.066
Hey...

36:01.134 --> 36:01.800
Wait, wait, no, where do
you think you're going?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.302
With you.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.169
No, no, you're a civilian
so thank you very much for

36:04.237 --> 36:05.771
all your help...

36:05.838 --> 36:08.006
You're running out of time
and you're going to need me.

36:08.074 --> 36:09.541
Okay, come on.

36:20.586 --> 36:21.819
Just wait here.

36:27.726 --> 36:29.192
Police!

36:29.260 --> 36:31.728
Easy ma'am, easy...

36:31.796 --> 36:34.230
I got a permit.

36:36.100 --> 36:40.537
What we got here?

36:43.841 --> 36:45.608
Get the hell out of here.

36:58.888 --> 37:00.789
Needle meet haystack.

37:03.559 --> 37:05.760
I got Canada Customs,
Agriculture, the trucking

37:05.828 --> 37:08.530
line and the cousin's
broker's databases all open.

37:08.597 --> 37:17.070
How many containers have
come in the last 24 hours?

37:17.138 --> 37:18.872
Four hundred and twelve.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.574
And they've all
been emptied?

37:20.642 --> 37:22.275
Yes and the contents
shipped out already.

37:22.344 --> 37:25.579
They don't play around down
there; it's all by the numbers.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.586
Hey, any of the containers
have the number 321 on them?

37:33.654 --> 37:38.791
I got a containers with
the numbers 6743-311

37:38.859 --> 37:40.259
Where's it headed?

37:40.327 --> 37:43.896
It looks like it's headed
for a company called

37:43.964 --> 37:46.298
Staffordton and
Sons Distributors.

37:52.505 --> 37:53.605
I'll let you know
if I need anything.

38:15.694 --> 38:20.530
Beautiful thing huh?

38:22.099 --> 38:23.533
IIB, no one move.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.538
Drop your weapons!

38:28.606 --> 38:30.673
Drop it now!

38:32.743 --> 38:34.377
Go, go.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.545
Easy...

39:24.325 --> 39:28.427
<i>They won't see</i>
<i>me in here, just wait it out.</i>

40:23.213 --> 40:25.548
Freeze!

40:25.582 --> 40:28.283
Drop your weapon.

40:28.318 --> 40:31.185
That's it, nice and slow...

40:31.253 --> 40:33.221
Get up!

40:34.056 --> 40:36.090
Okay Michelle, we
got you covered.

40:36.158 --> 40:38.793
Hands behind your head.

40:41.797 --> 40:43.832
Call it in.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.934
Nick always said
you had no spine.

41:01.582 --> 41:02.649
Hey...

41:02.716 --> 41:04.350
Hey.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.985
...so good thing
about being a cop is we

41:06.053 --> 41:08.187
have people who
do that for us.

41:08.255 --> 41:10.322
Oh, alright, I'm very jealous.

41:10.390 --> 41:13.693
I just wanted to say
thank you for your help.

41:13.761 --> 41:15.762
No problem.

41:16.763 --> 41:21.934
It's... I think it's my duty
or something, I don't know.

41:22.001 --> 41:24.570
So we got our guys.
Case closed.

41:24.637 --> 41:28.807
Nice, good for you, good.

41:28.875 --> 41:34.679
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around what it

41:34.746 --> 41:36.080
is you do exactly.

41:36.147 --> 41:37.915
You and me both.

41:37.983 --> 41:39.349
It's for real
though isn't it?

41:39.417 --> 41:42.286
Yeah, it's as real as
anything gets in my life.

41:42.353 --> 41:45.189
So you can hear what
people are thinking.

41:45.256 --> 41:50.727
Yeah, and I can see
it and sometimes

41:50.795 --> 41:52.462
you're never really sure.

41:52.529 --> 41:54.297
And how many people know?

41:54.364 --> 41:57.033
Very few.

41:57.101 --> 41:59.202
I guess two more now.

41:59.269 --> 42:02.438
Yeah, I told Dev.

42:02.506 --> 42:05.841
It must be strange getting
involved with the police again.

42:05.909 --> 42:08.343
You know.... actually no.

42:08.411 --> 42:10.845
It actually helps.

42:10.913 --> 42:14.448
I could see us using
your gift again if the

42:14.516 --> 42:15.583
situation were right.

42:15.651 --> 42:17.986
You know where to find me.

42:18.053 --> 42:20.421
