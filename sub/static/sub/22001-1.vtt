00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.758
*

00:24.792 --> 00:28.496
* Black and white city,
city wall, city wall *

00:28.529 --> 00:31.499
* Uh, drink that, uh *

00:31.532 --> 00:33.167
* She could be
dancing down a hall *

00:33.201 --> 00:34.402
* Dancing down a hall... *

00:34.435 --> 00:35.769
Guys, stop laughing at him.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.405
WAITER:
Who's got the lava flow?

00:37.438 --> 00:38.839
Yeah. Come to mama.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.441
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on a second.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.543
-(laughs) Are you serious?
-MICKEY: What?

00:42.576 --> 00:45.213
-What? -Where are your manners?
You don't even ask?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.947
Well, of course I don't ask.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.249
Well, don't you think
you should?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.118
Lava flows don't grow on trees.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.719
Okay, you guys are off
spending thousands of dollars

00:51.752 --> 00:53.554
on your own private villas.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.590
Meanwhile, I'm crammed into one
hotel room with Jimmy and Alba.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.692
And I can't even order myself
a drink?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
After everything
I've done for you?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.763
-You burned our house down.
-Ben burned the house down.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.465
Well, you gave me the lighter.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.800
Yeah, and that'll be
the last thing I ever give you.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.236
Mickey, it was one thing

01:08.269 --> 01:10.138
when you were squatting
in our mansion,

01:10.171 --> 01:12.039
but now you're costing us money.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.274
CHIP: All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.042
You can have the drink,

01:15.075 --> 01:17.645
-but you have to lick it
from a saucer like a cat. -Nice.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.313
I'm not gonna be drinking
like a cat.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.714
Oh, then you're not gonna
be drinking at all.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.250
MICKEY:
This is ridiculous.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.084
You guys have been feeding Alba
drinks for weeks.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.819
Well, yeah,
that's 'cause it annoys you

01:25.853 --> 01:27.588
-and that's funny to us. -Right.
-MICKEY: It's not funny.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
It's not funny at all.
She has a problem.

01:28.822 --> 01:29.890
Look at her.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.058
You think this is a game?!

01:31.091 --> 01:32.160
Do you think I am joking?!

01:32.193 --> 01:33.961
Fix it, mango brain. Go!

01:33.994 --> 01:35.429
What are you looking at?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.831
-Alba's scaring me.
-Yeah, no kidding.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.099
Try sleeping with her.
She's the devil.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.234
Now give me my drink.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.269
No!

01:41.302 --> 01:42.736
Fine. How about I leave

01:42.770 --> 01:44.438
and you guys can find yourself
a new guardian?

01:44.472 --> 01:45.606
Please. Where are you gonna go?

01:45.639 --> 01:46.740
This place is amazing.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.975
SABRINA:
Yeah, come on, Mickey.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.277
Are you really gonna
leave all this?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.911
The food, the service.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.913
God, even the people
are better looking.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.315
Have you seen those women
at the bar?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.150
MICKEY:
The escorts? Uh-huh.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.651
-Wait, seriously?
-JIMMY: Oh, yeah.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.353
They're insanely overpriced.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.423
So I've heard.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.792
That's so frickin' awesome.
Excuse me, sir.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.360
Can you take this drink
to the ladies

02:06.394 --> 02:08.095
at the bar? Tell them
to keep up the good work.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.330
I-I don't work here.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.731
I'm Barry Kotler.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.034
Your money manager.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.537
-Oh, yeah. Right.
-Oh, that's where he's from.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.939
I-I've tried calling you
several times.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.941
Uh, well, we've kind of been
off the grid, so...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.543
Well, not according
to your bank statements.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.712
Your spending is out of control.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.380
Well, you pay for quality.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.715
-Am I right?
-(laughs): Yeah.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.483
I don't think you're hearing me.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.151
It's my responsibility
to make sure

02:31.185 --> 02:32.720
that this money
lasts a lifetime,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.955
so, I'm freezing your accounts

02:34.988 --> 02:36.890
until we can come up with
a strategy. -CHIP: No, no. -No.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.359
-You will do no such thing.
-Absolutely not.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.361
(laughs): I like it.
I like this. Nice one.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.995
No, I've already got you
another hotel.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.298
I'm sure it will be
more than adequate.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.200
(Mickey laughs)

02:46.234 --> 02:48.636
No frickin' way.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.805
-This isn't real. Is this real?
-I don't like it here.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.175
Yeah. Yeah, this isn't quite
as funny on its feet.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.345
Okay, you know,
I'm gonna jump in here.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.913
Barry, I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.850
Okay, I'm not sure who you are,
but I don't work for you.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.386
Well, you work for me and I say
hit the frickin' bricks, dog.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.421
I work for your parents.
You can take it up with them.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.022
-Screw that!
-Yeah, screw them.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.358
-Yeah, let's trash the place!
(yells) -Whoa!

03:10.391 --> 03:11.759
BARRY:
Hey!

03:11.792 --> 03:13.327
-What the... come on.
-Oh, okay, listen.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.095
Barry, Barry,
I'm gonna ask you to leave now.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.664
It's for your own safety. Okay?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.065
BARRY:
Your spending is out...

03:18.098 --> 03:20.501
There's no room service.
There's no spa!

03:20.534 --> 03:23.103
The only frickin' amenity
is a fricking Bible!

03:23.136 --> 03:24.438
All right, all right.
Everyone calm down.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.739
I got this under control.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.107
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.742
-You're used to being poor.
-Yeah.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.910
But I'd rather die than go back.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.379
JIMMY:
Yeah? I got one for you.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.013
We head back to the Fairbanks.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.483
I swan dive
into the shallow end.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.286
What's that gonna do?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.388
Well, in a perfect world,
it's gonna snap my neck,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.890
and then we get free rooms
for the rest of our lives.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.792
Jimmy, can you stop talking?
I have a plan.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.694
Can we just get rid
of this guy already?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.262
It's insane that
he's lasted this long.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.997
Oh, you're just gonna thr...

03:51.299 --> 03:52.933
Fine!

03:52.966 --> 03:54.902
I hope you burn in hell.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.304
(door opens)

03:56.337 --> 03:58.406
All right, so, what's the plan?

03:58.439 --> 04:01.942
Hold on, hold on, everybody just
hold your horses, all right?

04:01.975 --> 04:04.044
I got a few demands.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.246
-For starters, I want
my own villa. -(Sabrina sighs)

04:06.280 --> 04:07.615
Fine, just get on with it.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.649
Oh, I'm not done.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.050
I also want per diem.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.485
I'm thinking
a thousand dollars a day

04:11.519 --> 04:13.554
and I want you to respect me.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.122
(both laugh)

04:15.155 --> 04:17.157
Yeah, that's kind of something
you got to earn.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.459
Fine. Give me your ring
and I'll take that watch.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.460
You, too, Ben.
Empty those pockets.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.461
-No way.
-Yeah, right.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.895
Oh, yeah? Okay.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.997
-Uh, good luck. Ugh.
-CHIP: Wait, no, no, no.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.232
-All right.
-Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.467
-Yeah?
-SABRINA: All right.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.735
Oh-oh, what is it?
What is that?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.070
-Geez.
-All right. Yeah.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.305
-It's very expensive, so...
-Come on, come on.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.107
Ooh. Interesting. Okay.
Here we go.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.643
I'll take it.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.178
Let's get down to it.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.847
Boom.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.982
I don't get it.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.851
It's Barry's phone.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.086
-I swiped it.
-So?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.755
Everything you need
to know about a person

04:47.788 --> 04:50.691
is in their phone-- their
secrets, their weaknesses.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.261
For example... oh.
What's this?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.363
His family?

04:55.396 --> 04:56.497
Oh, you see family?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.665
I see leverage.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.766
Come on, let's roll.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.167
Alba, look after...

05:00.200 --> 05:01.635
(snoring)

05:01.669 --> 05:04.271
Boys, keep an eye on Alba.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.739
Not it.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.145
CHOIR (on TV):
* Jesus *

05:12.179 --> 05:13.847
Demons walk amongst us.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.016
They have possessed
our brothers and sisters.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.119
We must tie them down and say,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.555
"In the name of the Lord,
I cast you out!"

05:21.589 --> 05:22.790
It's all in here, people.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.292
This book saves lives.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.327
And for a small donation...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.665
My brother's a pretty big guy.
He plays on the varsity team.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.900
Yo, Chip, what's up, man?
I hear you're staying at

05:32.933 --> 05:34.167
the Courtship Inn.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.970
Wait, the hotel
by the recycling plant?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.872
What? No, I'm not.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.841
Oh. You weren't there
this morning?

05:40.874 --> 05:43.076
Uh, no. Why would I be there

05:43.110 --> 05:45.413
when-when I'm already
at the Fairbanks?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.748
Wh-Where I have my own suite,
my own minibar.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.016
I have a big-ass flat-screen TV

05:49.049 --> 05:50.584
that I can order porn on
whenever I want.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.752
Nice.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.220
Yeah, dude.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.022
I'm watching porn,
like, all day.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.525
I'm watching so much porn,
it'll probably give me

05:57.558 --> 06:00.828
unrealistic expectations
about women and relationships.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.531
Where'd you even come up
with a story like that?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.098
My mom works there.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.934
-That sucks.
-Whatever, dude.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.436
I just thought
we could carpool, but...

06:08.469 --> 06:11.004
Ah, nah, bro. No can do.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.606
I'm straight chillin'
at the Fairbanks.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.274
Uh-- you should tell your mom
to get a job there.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.308
It's pretty tight.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.846
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.881
The Courtship.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.552
It's a funny image, though,
'cause it's so far-fetched.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.624
-*
-(groans softly) Wha...?

06:30.658 --> 06:34.628
-Hi.
-Benny, what-what is this?

06:34.662 --> 06:36.464
I'm curing you
of your wickedness.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.031
What? No.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.300
Benito, untie me now.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.369
-That's the devil talking.
-No.

06:42.402 --> 06:47.240
No, this is me talking,
your best friend, Alba.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.209
(Alba groans)

06:49.242 --> 06:51.812
Oh, oh, oh, Ben, Benny,
there's a bottle in my purse.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.113
Go get it, go get it.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.983
Good boy. Okay.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.819
Yeah, that's it. Uh-huh.
Now bring it, bring it here.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.053
No, no, no!

07:00.087 --> 07:01.455
(demonic voice):
Damn you!

07:01.489 --> 07:03.423
(Alba cries)

07:03.457 --> 07:06.293
(straining)

07:06.326 --> 07:08.228
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.763
What? No.
What-what are you doing?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.331
"In the beginning...

07:11.364 --> 07:14.502
-No! No! -...God created
the heavens and the earth."

07:14.535 --> 07:15.903
What up, fam?
It's your boy, Chip,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.671
coming at you live
from the Fairbanks,

07:17.705 --> 07:21.108
AKA Chip City,
AKA my frickin' house, AK...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.176
Hey, big news. I got pubes.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.512
Stop.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.613
You get our money back yet?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.180
Well, the wheels are in motion.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.082
We're actually here
to find an escort

07:29.116 --> 07:31.318
to fall in love with Barry
so we can blackmail his ass.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.520
This is your plan?

07:32.553 --> 07:33.854
Relax. We're working on it.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.623
Yo. What's cooking?

07:35.656 --> 07:36.957
CHIP:
The hell did you come from?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.358
I never left.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.860
You don't have a room.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.161
Yeah. I got a method.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.796
I call it
"The Jimmy Technique."

07:42.830 --> 07:44.297
I thought The Jimmy Technique
was getting bloodstains

07:44.331 --> 07:45.966
out of pants
without washing them.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.167
Yeah, there's more than one
Jimmy Technique.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.636
-Fascinating.
-Yeah.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.971
Excuse us.
We're gonna go bag a date.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.840
I don't understand.
You've just been staying here

07:52.873 --> 07:54.341
since we left?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.710
Oh, I've been thriving here
since you left.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.346
Think I could do that, too?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.048
First admit that you need me.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.950
Never gonna happen.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.285
Fine. I'll do it anyway.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.387
-Let's get you a robe.
-Why?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.222
Because no one ever questions
a man in a robe.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.824
And also, you don't
give them time to,

08:10.858 --> 08:12.125
because you should
always be moving.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.727
Let's roll.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.298
(Sabrina laughs softly)

08:18.331 --> 08:19.499
Are you sure she's an escort?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.368
She's so elegant.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.170
MICKEY: Yeah, beautiful women
like that don't need to sit

08:23.203 --> 08:24.972
and drink alone at hotel bars
in the middle of the afternoon.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.740
I guess that's a good point.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.475
-All right, go talk to her.
-That's not how it works.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.443
There's a protocol
to this kind of thing.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.913
What are you doing?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.915
MICKEY:
I'm reaching out with my eyes.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.349
I-- what are you
trying to communicate?

08:36.383 --> 08:39.352
Sex. Sex for money.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.888
Well, you look
like you're having a stroke.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.723
-Okay?
-I don't...

08:42.756 --> 08:44.858
-SABRINA: I think she...
she's coming. -MICKEY: Oh...

08:44.892 --> 08:46.059
Look at that.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.995
Hi, I'm Aimee.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.097
Hi, Aimee, I'm Mickey.
And this is Sabrina.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.733
Hi. You're so pretty.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.501
Aw, thanks.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.369
So, we're sort of new
to this kind of thing.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.572
You're gonna have
to walk us through how it goes.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.340
Well, I charge $600 an hour,

09:00.373 --> 09:03.110
but you guys seem sweet,
so let's just call it a grand

09:03.143 --> 09:04.511
-for both of you.
-Ooh!

09:04.544 --> 09:05.846
(both laugh)

09:05.879 --> 09:08.248
Oh, man. I-I mean, I wish.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.550
-"Both of..."
-But...

09:10.584 --> 09:12.119
-It's just a misunderstanding.
-It's not for us.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.386
But yeah, it's not for us.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.855
It's for our friend Barry.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.757
I got a picture of him
right here for you.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.558
(blows raspberry)

09:18.592 --> 09:21.895
-MICKEY: One little thing:
he is married. -It's okay.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.964
That's good. Now,
we need you to slip him a bone

09:23.997 --> 09:25.565
without him knowing
that we paid you.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.967
-So here's what I'm thinking...
-You know,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.602
I don't think
I can help you guys.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.070
What do you mean?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.640
-He's gay, right?
-What?

09:32.673 --> 09:35.643
He's got Poundr on his phone.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.877
What the hell's "Poundr"?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.646
It's a gay hookup app.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.414
Oh. It most certainly is.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.050
-Hmm.
-Okay.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.584
What the hell was I thinking,
listening to you?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.253
-Give me that ring back.
-Hey! Stop it.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.655
What are you talking about?
That was great.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.122
Mickey, he's gay.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.590
Yeah, and married.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.959
What a beautiful gift.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.762
What more leverage do you want?

09:54.795 --> 09:57.164
Okay, I-I thought you would've
caught on by now,

09:57.197 --> 09:58.966
but I don't know,
maybe I'm dumber than you are.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.600
What-what is that?

10:00.634 --> 10:03.603
What? Idiot.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.778
(quietly):
Okay.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.412
Oh. Hey, what the hell, man?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.814
Always be wet.
The wetter the better.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.582
It projects an air of busyness.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.151
Like you're in a rush
and you can't be bothered.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.820
Let's go.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.254
All right.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.622
(stammers):
What if I'm hungry?

10:22.656 --> 10:24.191
Yeah. Well.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.427
There's always
the found-food option.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.996
It's a bit amateur hour.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.864
What you want to do
is hit the buffets,

10:30.898 --> 10:32.499
corporate events,
stuff like that.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.702
Yesterday, there was an
insurance brokers convention.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.203
Had a pasta bar.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.105
I'd put it up
against any spot in Italy.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.940
You've been to Italy?

10:39.973 --> 10:43.176
I don't have to go to Italy
to know this was good.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.978
Well, don't they ask
your room number?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.781
Yeah. And, you know,
but you just make it up.

10:47.815 --> 10:48.949
You really got this figured out.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.217
Oh, damn right.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.019
I got this place wired
like Eloise.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.222
How do you know Eloise?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.224
I know a lot of things.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.193
This way.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.562
Afternoon.
May I please see a room key?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.631
Oh, God, I-- you know,
I must've left it in my pants.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.034
But, uh, we're 1242.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.502
Excellent. Enjoy.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.738
-You look great.
-Thank you.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.574
SABRINA:
This is a bad idea, Mickey.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.576
What are you talking about?
It's the exact same plan.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.345
It is not at all the same.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.180
-Because he's gay?
-(distant siren wailing)

11:20.213 --> 11:22.182
-Don't do that.
-No, not because he's gay,

11:22.215 --> 11:23.917
because we were just
at a five-star hotel,

11:23.951 --> 11:25.385
and now we're in a crack alley.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.388
(sighs) Where are all
the fancy male escorts?

11:28.421 --> 11:29.757
Oh, they don't exist.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.492
No, the, uh, pool
for male prostitutes is,

11:32.525 --> 11:34.194
i-it's more like a puddle.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.863
SABRINA:
What's the protocol here?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.397
There isn't one.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.532
It's like ordering peanuts
at a ballgame.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.368
(wolf whistles)

11:41.401 --> 11:44.071
No, not you. This guy--
handsome one, with the arms.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.974
Think she wants you, man.
Get it.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.781
You ladies lost?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.048
Nope.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.350
No, we are, uh,
in the exact right spot.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.886
You sure?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.754
I mean, I'm not a drug dealer.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.356
I mean, I have drugs to sell
you, but that's not what I do.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.593
Uh, no, we are in fact looking
for the company of a man.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.295
Oh, my bad.
We just don't get a lot

12:08.328 --> 12:09.596
of pretty ladies around here.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.964
Guess it's my lucky day.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
Uh-huh, well,
it is and it isn't.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.768
It's for a friend.
He's a dude.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.536
Oh. No problem.
I'll make it work.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.940
-Aren't you gay?
-Mm, I'm a survivor, sweetheart.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.441
That's what I'm talking about.
Did you hear that?

12:21.474 --> 12:22.776
He is a survivor.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.111
You could learn a lot
from this guy.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.645
Yeah. He's a real inspiration.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.147
You are hired.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.715
Rock and roll.
Let me just go get my backpack.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.051
MICKEY:
Yeah, get that backpack.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.552
SABRINA: Come on, Barry's never
gonna go for this junkie.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.154
MICKEY:
Of course he will.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.423
We just got to slap
a fresh coat of paint on him.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.125
* When you're walking
down the street *

12:38.158 --> 12:40.828
* And the man tries
to get your business *

12:43.864 --> 12:46.399
* And the people that you meet
want to open you up *

12:46.433 --> 12:49.169
* Like Christmas *

12:51.171 --> 12:53.140
-"...king of Judah returned..."
-* 'Cause you're *

12:53.173 --> 12:55.508
-(screaming)
-* Filthy *

12:55.542 --> 12:57.677
* Ooh, and I'm gorgeous *

12:57.710 --> 12:58.979
* Gorgeous *

12:59.012 --> 13:01.381
* 'Cause you're filthy *

13:02.950 --> 13:04.751
* Ooh, and I'm gorgeous *

13:04.784 --> 13:07.254
* Gorgeous *

13:07.287 --> 13:09.022
* You're disgusting *

13:10.357 --> 13:12.492
* Ooh, and you're nasty *

13:13.961 --> 13:15.829
* And you can grab me *

13:17.630 --> 13:20.200
* Ooh, 'cause you're nasty. *

13:26.339 --> 13:28.075
Yep.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.043
(trilling)

13:30.077 --> 13:31.178
You know who it is.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.479
Another day in paradise.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.713
Sun shining.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.348
Chicken tendies on point.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.017
Peep my sauce game: barbeque,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.819
honey muzz, some kind
of dope ranch or blue cheese--

13:39.853 --> 13:42.189
I'm not really sure, but we're
gonna get to the bottom of it.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.390
Peace.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.158
Cut.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.459
This is beautiful.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.995
I'm shooting you
from a low angle.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.997
It'll really capture
your power in the frame.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.564
Chips and Dip!

13:51.598 --> 13:53.000
What up, guys?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.367
Who are those guys?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.802
I invited a couple friends over.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.237
Are you nuts?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.206
-You're gonna blow this thing.
-What?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.474
Chill out.
We got this place on lock.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.076
That's because
we keep it simple, okay?

14:03.110 --> 14:04.244
We do a little here
and a little there.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.046
Get some water in your hair,

14:06.079 --> 14:07.314
for Pete's sake.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.681
Chill out, man.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.849
Chill out.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.584
Listen, nobody's gonna notice.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.253
You are flying
too close to the sun.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
Okay? And old Jimbo
ain't going out like that.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.191
Listen, if you can't handle the
heat, get out of the kitchen.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.062
Big mistake.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.430
You're not gonna last
a day without me.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.731
(scoffs)

14:24.764 --> 14:26.333
I'm like Eloise
up in this bitch.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.901
Maybe if you'd bothered
to read Eloise,

14:27.935 --> 14:29.636
you'd realize
she's pretty damn lonely.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.406
She's just a little girl...

14:33.440 --> 14:35.642
abandoned in a hotel
in New York City.

14:38.811 --> 14:42.415
What up, guys?
Let's get you into some robes.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.085
"And in the grace of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

14:45.118 --> 14:47.921
to be with you all. Amen."

14:47.955 --> 14:50.090
So, how do you feel?

14:50.123 --> 14:53.526
Very good... thank you.
Now please untie me.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.862
-So, you're all better now?
-Yep, fully cured. Let's go.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.764
-Okay.
-(Alba sighs)

14:57.797 --> 14:59.266
(quietly):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.268
Oh. Yes! Oh.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.770
-Ooh, ooh.
-Got it?

15:03.803 --> 15:05.772
(sighs)

15:05.805 --> 15:07.640
Oh. (groans)
Where's my sock?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.409
SABRINA:
You know,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.811
-I got to admit, he looks pretty
great. Yeah. -He looks good.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.414
Can I just say thank you?
I look great.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.984
I feel healthy,
I'm drinking water.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.286
I mean, this might not be
significant to you guys,

15:19.319 --> 15:20.887
but I can't even remember
the last time

15:20.920 --> 15:22.722
-I had a bottle of...
-That is so good to hear.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.125
It makes me feel good, but we
are in a bit of a time crunch,

15:25.158 --> 15:26.726
-so I'm gonna hang
onto this guy. -Mickey!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.095
-Huh? Hmm?
-What the hell's wrong with you?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.262
What? He can have water.
You can have water

15:29.296 --> 15:30.463
when you're done with the job.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.564
She's right. A deal's a deal.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.266
-Right?
-All right. Okay, fine.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.468
-You know what you're doing,
right? -I think so.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.104
All right, any minute,
Barry's gonna leave for work.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.072
You're gonna follow him,
he'll pull to a stop.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.940
Rear-end him--
just a little tap, okay?

15:40.974 --> 15:43.076
-Your classic meet-cute.
-Yep. You guys will exchange

15:43.110 --> 15:45.578
information, then eventually,
bodily fluids.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.314
And if he still doesn't want
to turn the money back on,

15:47.347 --> 15:48.781
we tell his wife
he's banging dudes.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.917
-SABRINA: Mm-hmm.
-This is a great plan.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.986
Aah! He's early.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.022
-Go get 'em.
-Wish me luck.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.889
(engine starts)

16:00.360 --> 16:02.529
All right.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.464
MICKEY: Is this man aware
of speed limits?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.633
It seems fast. I'm not sure
that thing's even gonna...

16:07.734 --> 16:09.102
-Whoa!
-Oh!

16:09.136 --> 16:10.670
MICKEY:
And there goes the money.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.707
-Ah, yeah, he didn't like that.
-What the hell, man?!

16:14.741 --> 16:17.044
Didn't you see I was stopped?
Come on, I mean...

16:17.077 --> 16:18.311
Oh, wow. Hey.
Oh, you're bleeding.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.013
-Ho. Ho. Ho. I got you.
I got you. -Oh.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.814
-MICKEY: He's mostly staying
conscious. -You okay?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.983
-But they... they did meet.
-Uh.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.618
Wow.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.521
You're... beautiful.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.957
(giggles)
Uh...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.525
MICKEY:
Hmm.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.294
SABRINA:
Holy crap. I think it's working.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.630
Of course it's working.
It's a great plan.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.899
No. You're dead. Stop.
Just get him, get him.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.834
-You get... get him.
-Excuse me.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.672
-Can I help you gentlemen with
something? -Nah, we're good.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.341
You don't mind
if I see a room key, do you?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.077
Yeah...

16:50.110 --> 16:52.045
(inhales sharply)
Must've left it in my pants.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.881
Oh, no problem. What's the name
on the reservation?

16:54.914 --> 16:57.084
I'd rather not say.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.551
And why is that?

17:00.587 --> 17:03.156
I don't feel comfortable giving
my name out to strangers.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.425
All right, look, fellas,

17:05.458 --> 17:08.228
if you're not guests
of the hotel, you have to leave.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.331
JIMMY:
Hey! Hey!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.832
-What the hell's going on?
-(water dripping)

17:12.865 --> 17:14.867
Sir, you're soaking wet.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.070
Oh, well, thanks for the update,
Katie Couric.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.872
I was about to dry off when
I saw you manhandling my boy.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.575
And you're lucky I didn't
bust my ass walking around

17:22.609 --> 17:26.213
-on that marble. -I just asked
if he was a guest at the hotel.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.115
Oh, did you not see the robe,
you jackass?

17:28.148 --> 17:30.450
Quit trying to be a hero, Kurt.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.186
I apologize.
That's my mistake.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.255
What can I do to make it right?

17:35.288 --> 17:38.057
Well, look who decided
to show up to work.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.893
You could start
by giving me a towel. Now!

17:40.927 --> 17:43.763
Right away.
I'm very sorry.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.532
I'm sorry about that, boys.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.066
World's full of idiots.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.768
I think it's time you head home,

17:48.801 --> 17:51.070
but you can
come back any time, okay?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.442
Listen, Jimmy, I...

17:55.475 --> 17:58.611
Hey. It's all right.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.912
Me, too.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.322
-(Alba laughs)
-Mmm. -Ooh. -Yeah?

18:09.356 --> 18:13.426
-Mmm! Kumamotos on point
tonight. -JIMMY: Yeah...

18:13.460 --> 18:14.827
-(all laugh) -Hey,
have another one. Have 'em all.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.296
-It's your day.
-That's right.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.565
-Ah. -No, you know what?
Actually, excuse me?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.800
Can we have a lava flow
for the lady, please?

18:20.833 --> 18:23.002
-Sabrina, thank you.
-You deserve it.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.004
-Mm. -And I hate to admit it,
but you have earned

18:25.037 --> 18:28.007
the teeniest,
littlest bit of my respect.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.343
Look, I am just glad
we are out of the Courtship.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.944
-Am I right? -Yes. -Yes.
-JIMMY: Oh, yeah.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.513
I also did not love it there.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.947
-To the Fairbanks.
-MICKEY: Yes!

18:34.981 --> 18:37.350
-Fairbanks! -Fairbanks!
-(all cheering)

18:37.384 --> 18:38.785
-Ooh, it's Barry!
-Barry!

18:38.818 --> 18:40.187
-(all cheering)
-No, no, no, no.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.855
What... what are you still
doing here?

18:42.889 --> 18:44.924
Well, Barr, we live here.
You know what I mean?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.859
-(laughs)
-No. We've been over this.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.361
You cannot afford...

18:48.395 --> 18:50.197
-Is that caviar?
-MICKEY: Mm. -JIMMY: Yeah.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.931
Little guy's really taken to it.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.266
-I'm eating fish eggs.
-(Sabrina laughs)

18:53.300 --> 18:55.034
No, no, no,
not anymore you're not.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.204
Come on, come on, let's go.
Fun's over.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.605
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No to you, Barry.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.473
Here's how it's gonna go down.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.842
We're gonna finish eating
our meal, and you're welcome

19:02.875 --> 19:04.544
to join us if you want,
but as soon as we're finished,

19:04.577 --> 19:06.879
little Ben here is gonna
hand the waiter his credit card.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.816
And if I so much
as hear the word "declined"

19:09.849 --> 19:12.185
come out of his mouth,
so help me God,

19:12.219 --> 19:13.820
your pretty little wife

19:13.853 --> 19:17.457
is gonna get
a not-so-pretty little package.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.559
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.828
-CHIP: Oh, poor Barry.
-BARRY: Where did you get these?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.897
We live on the 47th floor
of the Fairbanks Hotel, Barry.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.866
-We see everything.
-(Sabrina laughs)

19:26.899 --> 19:29.001
-I don't have a wife.
-MICKEY: Oh, yeah?

19:29.035 --> 19:32.239
Then who, may I ask,
is this lovely lady?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.407
-Where did you get my phone?
-I asked you first.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.309
That is my sister and her kids.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.744
I've been living with them

19:37.777 --> 19:39.946
since their father was killed
in Afghanistan.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.818
Mmm...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.420
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.156
Uh-huh.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.559
Well.

19:52.592 --> 19:56.996
If you will all excuse me
for a moment,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.467
I am, uh,
going to visit the ladies room.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.173
Guys, I've been working
for your family for a long time,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.175
and I hope
I'm not overstepping my bounds

20:09.208 --> 20:12.779
when I say
your aunt is bad news.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.447
-Whoa!
-(guests exclaim)

20:14.481 --> 20:15.415
-Oh!
-Mickey!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.049
-Oh!
-Oh!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.552
(thunder rumbles)

20:34.401 --> 20:37.203
Okay, it's a little charred,
I see that.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.573
But it's still a mansion, right?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.578
(sighs)
How was I supposed to know

20:45.612 --> 20:47.280
there were gonna be cameras
everywhere?

20:47.314 --> 20:49.215
It was a stupid plan
to begin with.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.818
I almost broke my neck
for you people.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.721
Yeah, until your fat
frickin' fingers got in the way.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.390
-(rain dripping)
-Ugh.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.292
(thunder rumbles)

20:59.326 --> 21:01.027
-(rain falling harder)
-Oh... (scoffs)

21:03.095 --> 21:05.332
-(sighs) I'm going to bed.
-Me, too.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.134
Come on, Benny.
Let's go brush your teeth.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.838
-BEN: I miss the Courtship.
-Let's go.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.673
(rain continues dripping)

21:16.609 --> 21:18.445
What do you say
we call it a night, Mick?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.649
Go ahead.
I'll be up in a minute.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.393
(thunder rumbles)

21:35.495 --> 21:37.897
(gasps, sighs)

21:42.902 --> 21:44.371
BEN:
That's the devil talking.
