WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.936
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.970 --> 00:05.373
The IVF worked; I'm pregnant.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.574
You know, Randall is the one

00:06.607 --> 00:08.309
running against me
for city council.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.111
So, uh, how many voters
you register?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.479
-About 200.
-Ah.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.182
You only need around, uh,
20,000 more.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.017
I mean, pretty soon you're gonna
have your first boyfriend.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.453
Or... girlfriend.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.322
Or girlfriend.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.125
He gave me her necklace, right?
That means something.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.793
I'm gonna go to Vietnam

00:25.826 --> 00:27.628
and I'm gonna figure out
my dad's story.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.696
Jack, that really you?

00:28.729 --> 00:29.830
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.300
You got two weeks.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.468
You should have left me to rot.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.038
JACK:
Everybody in?

00:41.008 --> 00:44.578
* I am an old woman

00:44.612 --> 00:46.214
* Named after my mother

00:46.247 --> 00:48.649
Nicky. Come on.

00:48.682 --> 00:53.754
* My old man is another child
that's grown old *

00:55.756 --> 00:56.757
JACK:
Come on.

00:57.825 --> 01:01.395
* If dreams were lightning

01:01.429 --> 01:05.032
* And thunder were desire

01:05.065 --> 01:08.402
* This old house
would've burnt down *

01:08.436 --> 01:09.870
* A long time ago

01:09.903 --> 01:11.339
JACK:
Roger that, sir.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.006
I'm-I'm aware you said
two weeks.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.808
I was hoping you'd be
a little flexible with...

01:14.842 --> 01:17.711
Oh, no, no. No, it's...

01:17.745 --> 01:21.549
Sir, if I just had
a few extra days, I...

01:21.582 --> 01:23.884
Affirmative.

01:23.917 --> 01:24.885
Out.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.720
* Of an old rodeo

01:28.422 --> 01:30.858
* To believe in this living...

01:30.891 --> 01:33.561
Hey. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.497
Yeah, I didn't really feel
like being found.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.433
Okay, well, come on.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.001
I want to take you someplace.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.836
No, thanks.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.238
Hey, Nicky, I...

01:44.272 --> 01:48.576
I know it must be a lot
for you right now

01:48.609 --> 01:53.314
without any drugs in your system
to push it all down. I...

01:53.347 --> 01:56.217
That's an astute observation,
Dr. Pearson.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.152
It really is, but unless you got

01:58.186 --> 02:00.654
any military business with me,
I'm gonna be on my way.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.190
Hey, hey, hey.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.392
Stop.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.659
Stop. Just stop.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.175
That feel good, huh?

02:30.017 --> 02:34.655
I got 48 hours left
with you, kid.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.658
That's all.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.927
48 hours, then you are back
on your own base.

02:42.029 --> 02:45.633
And I don't know what
after that.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.043
Where did you want to take me,
again?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.648
*

03:08.889 --> 03:11.158
KEVIN:
Okay, the rain finally stopped.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.593
This is good. We should be able

03:12.626 --> 03:14.161
to get to the village
by tomorrow.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.829
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.498
Or maybe the roads
will still be blocked

03:17.531 --> 03:20.534
and we'll have to go
the next day or the next.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.570
Just try and go with the flow.

03:24.738 --> 03:28.709
Right. Yeah. Just, you know...
go with the flow.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.077
Just-- except that's impossible.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.779
This is excruciating,
you know.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.814
Like, we're 50 miles away
from where my dad served,

03:33.847 --> 03:35.616
and we're trapped here.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.385
You know, it's like we're stuck
in one of those

03:37.418 --> 03:39.987
Netflix documentaries, like the
pizza bomber one, you know?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.389
Where they just unraveling
all the clues.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.823
And then you have to watch,
right?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.157
'Cause you're
at the last episode.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.026
The one where
you finally find out

03:46.059 --> 03:48.529
who the woman wearing my dad's
necklace in the photo was,

03:48.562 --> 03:51.231
and how he met her and just,

03:51.265 --> 03:53.801
you know, all of it.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.904
The thing about documentaries
is, you can't force them

03:56.937 --> 03:59.139
to end the way you want them to.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.175
I-I know.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.384
TRUNG:
Hello, Mr. Pearson.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.520
-Hey.
-I wanted to bring

04:12.553 --> 04:14.588
a complimentary breakfast
to my favorite guest.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.189
-That's very nice.
Thank you so much.
-Oh, wow. Thank you.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.925
And-and I don't want you
to think that I forgot

04:17.958 --> 04:19.360
about that shirtless selfie
that you wanted for your sister.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.594
I'm gonna do that for you
tomorrow.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.296
I have good news for you.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.632
The roads are finally clear
from the rains.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.634
I can take you on the tour
of Sông Trà tomorrow.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.201
-Great. That'd be wonderful,
thank you.
-Great.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.637
Okay. I'll have the car ready

04:29.670 --> 04:31.805
at 8:00 a.m., which means...

04:31.839 --> 04:33.841
Shirtless selfie at 7:45.
Yeah. Got it.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.376
No problem. Thank you.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
Manny nói gi!

04:36.810 --> 04:38.679
Ah.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.281
-Manny nói gi!
-I'm not gonna do it.

04:41.315 --> 04:45.953
DR. JASPER: Okay, so your
ultrasound just now looks great.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.888
Second one in a row.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.958
Also, your NIPT results
came back normal.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.860
No chromosomal abnormalities.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.063
The test also reveals
the sex of the baby.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.498
Do you want to know what it is?

04:58.699 --> 05:01.369
Uh... I say let's wait.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.705
-We can be surprised.
-Yeah.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.707
DR. JASPER:
Surprise it is.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.642
Now the less fun news.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.279
This job you mentioned,
the singing telegrams.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.849
Adele-o-grams.
I sing Adele as a telegram.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.452
-Right.
: Adele-o-gram.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.021
You mentioned that has you
driving a lot,

05:21.054 --> 05:22.956
sometimes to places
a couple hours away.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.392
Yeah. Is that a problem, or...?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.727
I don't love you sitting
that much.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.663
Your blood pressure is still
higher than I'd like.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.666
But of course, I can't tell you
to quit your job.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.570
RANDALL:
Copacetic.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.938
ANNIE:
Copacetic.

05:37.971 --> 05:43.176
C-O-P-A-C-E-T-I-C.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.446
Oh, dang, girl.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.248
You are gonna demolish
this spelling bee. Way to go.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.884
Hey, Randall, can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.221
:
Busted.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.456
Night, baby.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.491
-Night, Dad.
-I love you.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.892
Love you, too.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.966
You have a debate
with Sol Brown tomorrow

06:05.999 --> 06:08.669
and you haven't gone over any
of your talking points all day.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.804
I'm off the campaign one week
and you're slipping?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.105
You know you didn't have
to leave.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.273
Yes, I did.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.342
And it was best
for the both of us.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.912
And you apologized profusely
with chocolate.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.582
-Hmm.
-Now you need to practice.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.850
I'll quiz you.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.985
You sure you don't mind
helping me?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.888
I'm happy to help...
in an unofficial,

06:27.921 --> 06:30.157
like, best-wife-in-the-world
capacity.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.725
Oh, I love that capacity.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.462
That's my favorite capacity.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.429
Night, Tess.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.197
-Night.
-Hey, Tess.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.200
Remember, Grandma's picking you
up tomorrow after gymnastics

06:40.233 --> 06:41.569
to take you to meet us
at the debate.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.337
-Fine.
-Good night, sweet pea.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.842
That pea has not been
as sweet as usual.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.679
Yeah. Something's up with her.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.380
DEJA:
Okay, I got to go.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.850
Yeah, they make us go
to bed mad early.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.018
All right, love you, too, Mom.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.887
Bye.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.527
Deja calls her mom?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.729
I had no idea.
That's news to me.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.063
I didn't know
they were back in touch.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.199
Ooh, we should talk to her.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.901
I mean, let her know it's okay
if they're communicating,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.536
but we should be kept
in the loop, right?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.938
-Yeah, but--
Wait, hold on, hold on.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.007
We have to think
about how to do this.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.543
And you need to focus
on this debate.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.311
This family is not gonna be
the thing that keeps you

07:24.344 --> 07:25.979
from succeeding tomorrow.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.548
This family lifts each other up.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.551
Do I hear you?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.252
You're my favorite sound
in the world.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.388
-Of course I hear you.
-Don't be soft, man. Come on.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.825
-City taxes and statistics.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.402
This is the spot.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.910
Out here war feels far away.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.914
Still there, though.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.283
Yeah, but look,

08:03.316 --> 08:05.586
look how tiny the ville looks
from here,

08:05.619 --> 08:08.055
you know, when you get a little
bit of distance from it.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.926
That's what this war's gonna be
for you.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.327
For us.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.497
Just a... distant memory.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.703
So we do our tour,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.938
we stay alive,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.440
and then we get
the hell outta here.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.276
But we can't do that

08:29.309 --> 08:32.312
if you don't stay focused
on the mission.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.384
Mission is to kill.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.620
No, Nicky.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.389
Mission is to get home.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.898
*

08:54.835 --> 08:56.970
TRUNG:
No vehicles can pass through.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.338
We have to walk
the rest of the way.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.309
Wow, it's beautiful here.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.545
-Your father's camp's a little
beyond this ridge here.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.648
My Uncle Nick served here
as well.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.316
-46th Infantry.
-Mm-hmm.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.986
-Died over here, actually.
-Oh. I'm so sorry.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.090
Listen, there's, uh, this woman
in all these old photographs.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.959
-Mm-hmm.
-That's my dad here.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.527
You think there's a chance
she might still be there?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.329
There's one man who was there
during the war

09:22.362 --> 09:23.697
when he was a young boy.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.532
He's a local historian
of sorts.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.834
He's agreed to speak
with you today.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.101
-Uh-huh.

09:29.870 --> 09:34.808
Next episode begins
in five, four, three...

09:34.842 --> 09:36.543
-'Cause it's Netflix.
-Got it.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.180
Maybe you could walk
to your Adele-o-grams,

09:40.213 --> 09:42.249
and only say yes
to the really close gigs.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.417
I can't be that picky, Madison.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.754
I mean, there aren't many people
looking to pay a random woman

09:46.787 --> 09:48.989
to dress up as Adele
and sing for them.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.092
And I know that stopping is
the right thing to do.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.094
But my job was
the one thing that I had

09:54.127 --> 09:56.063
to relieve stress
during the pregnancy.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.998
So let's fix this.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.033
We just have to find you
another job you love

10:00.067 --> 10:02.069
that doesn't have you stuck
in a car for hours.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.871
Oh, my God, I just had
one of those things

10:03.904 --> 10:05.138
that happens to drunks.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.408
A moment of clarity.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.243
Martin Van Buren.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.912
Listen, these are
tumultuous times,

10:11.945 --> 10:13.213
-but I'm not running
for president.
-No.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.049
I volunteer at
Van Buren High downtown.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.285
They need a chorus teacher,
like, ASAP.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.820
Mr. Fitch got hit by a bus.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.521
-Oh, no.
-No, he's fine.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.491
He was in another bus.
Two buses ran into each other.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.394
I'm e-mailing Principal Griffith
right now.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.129
We are super tight,
and they are gonna love you.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.733
* And those are three words
you never say. *

10:32.766 --> 10:34.835
Okay, remember,
we want to stay focused

10:34.868 --> 10:36.369
on personal stories
out there, okay?

10:36.403 --> 10:39.072
-Keep the facts and figures
bite-size, Randall.
-Yeah.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.141
-Courteous: C-O...
-JAE-WON: Hey.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.442
Facts and figures bite-size.
Say it.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.577
Hey, what's going on
with you over there?

10:44.611 --> 10:46.213
Your Insta story
blowing up or something?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.647
BETH:
Hey, Jae-won, would you mind

10:47.681 --> 10:48.682
taking the girls
to their seats for me?

10:48.716 --> 10:50.951
Of course.
Come on, ladies.

10:50.984 --> 10:56.089
Annie, can you spell
"career defining moment"?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.658
Close your eyes.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.461
-Beth, I'm trying to...
-Close your eyes.

11:03.797 --> 11:07.434
I want you to see yourself
going out there and killing it.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.436
You are prepared,

11:09.469 --> 11:11.638
you're wearing
the hell out of that suit

11:11.671 --> 11:14.641
and you were born to do this.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.677
Whatever they throw at you,
I want you to return it.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.912
Like Serena.

11:18.946 --> 11:23.483
You are fierce, dignified

11:23.516 --> 11:25.919
and in top form.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.721
Can you see it?

11:27.755 --> 11:30.791
I'm mostly just seeing Serena
Williams in that catsuit,

11:30.824 --> 11:32.893
but yes-- no, thank you.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.162
I can see it.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.064
Good.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.199
REBECCA:
I'm very excited

11:39.232 --> 11:42.235
about seeing your dad
on that debate stage.

11:42.269 --> 11:46.006
I'm actually kind of nervous.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.407
Even though I don't
have to do anything

11:47.440 --> 11:49.476
but sit there and watch.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.979
Oh...

11:52.012 --> 11:54.514
How's the school year
treating you?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.516
-It's fine.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.319
Middle school.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.322
I remember middle school.

12:02.355 --> 12:06.493
My God, the time I spent
worried about pimples.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.030
But you're doing okay?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.499
You don't have any issues?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.537
Aunt Kate told you.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.572
Told me what?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.880
She did.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.386
Did she tell my parents?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.223
No, of course she didn't,
sweetheart.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.592
No-- and I promise
she only told me because

12:39.626 --> 12:41.261
she's across the country
and she just wanted someone

12:41.294 --> 12:43.496
to look out for you
that was close by.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.498
That's it.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.771
You know, things today are very
different than they used to be.

12:51.805 --> 12:55.508
I mean, even ten years ago,
my good friends Jim and Paul

12:55.542 --> 12:58.578
-were trying to get...
-Grandma, I don't
want to talk about it.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.781
If I wanted to talk about it
with you, I would've told you.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.385
Okay.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.822
I'm sorry. I understand...

13:23.103 --> 13:26.239
*

13:51.531 --> 13:53.533
*

14:07.480 --> 14:09.249
-So the first solo,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.651
the entire school
is staring at me.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.322
And I think it was "Fly Away
Home" or "I Believe I Can Fly."

14:15.355 --> 14:17.124
I don't remember.
Somebody was flying.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.658
Anyhow, so I step forward,

14:18.691 --> 14:21.694
open my mouth
and I completely blanked.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.663
-No.
-Yes. And so, of course,
I just sing the first thing

14:23.696 --> 14:25.999
that comes to mind:
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

14:26.033 --> 14:28.835
-Also flying.
-Also flying. Right.

14:28.868 --> 14:33.273
Look, um, high school
was pretty tough for me.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.708
But chorus was
the one thing that I had

14:35.742 --> 14:38.178
to look forward to every day.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.880
So I would just love to be
that person for these kids.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.515
You know, I could give them
a place where they...

14:42.549 --> 14:45.852
Look, Kate,
I think you'd be great.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.521
-So let's talk about
your background.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.358
-Okay.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.328
Uh, the School of Hard Knocks,
class of '98?

14:55.362 --> 14:58.065
You don't have a college degree?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.433
No. I mean, I...

15:00.467 --> 15:02.535
I went,
but I just never finished.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.537
I'm so sorry.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.141
I just can't bring on anybody
without a college degree.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.177
:
State regulation...

15:10.210 --> 15:13.480
So even just changing
that number by three percent

15:13.513 --> 15:15.582
gets us to solvent in two years.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.417
So to answer
your question, Alicia,

15:17.450 --> 15:20.553
efficiency in how we deal
with revenue is a huge issue.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.756
Our moderator's name is Elisa.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.893
WTUV's illustrious 6:00 anchor.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.396
Uh, excuse me.
I-I knew that. I misspoke.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.032
Uh, maybe you have to live here
to get the pronunciation.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.371
Okay, I-I listen to your show
every night, Elisa.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.774
On his way home
to Alpine, New Jersey.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.445
Now, I don't have to tell you,

15:45.478 --> 15:47.547
but Professor Pearson's
math lecture

15:47.580 --> 15:50.917
was a long-winded way of saying
he'll raise your taxes.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.719
No, that's not--
that's not what I said.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.421
So no tax hike?
You can guarantee that?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.788
RANDALL:
I'm saying if we invest

15:55.822 --> 15:57.457
-in our community...
-Thank you.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.927
I'm glad you brought up
investing in our community,

16:00.960 --> 16:03.963
because it's something
that's very important to me.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.840
Oh, how's it going? Yeah.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.056
What are you doing?

17:39.192 --> 17:40.627
Are you high?

17:48.635 --> 17:52.105
Where'd you get it from?

17:54.006 --> 17:57.177
You know, it doesn't matter.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.846
I'm gonna get you
cleaned up again.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.049
Get that out of your system.
Come on. Stand up.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.252
Stand up. Come on. Get up.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.086
-No, no.
-Come on.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.925
No. I don't want
to get clean, Jack.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.163
I see it all again
when I'm clean.

18:19.266 --> 18:23.736
I'm not gonna
complete the mission.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.541
Don't follow me.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.592
I was actually
really excited by the idea

18:45.625 --> 18:47.227
of being a chorus teacher.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.729
All because of eight
freaking credits.

18:49.762 --> 18:53.300
Maybe you're just not supposed
to be working right now...

18:53.333 --> 18:55.368
he said in the most
supportive way possible,

18:55.402 --> 18:58.938
not meaning it all
and regretting it instantly.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.340
So you're glad
that I didn't get it.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.042
No, of course not. I just think

19:03.075 --> 19:07.046
that maybe you should just take
this time to relax.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.981
Toby, I can't relax.

19:09.015 --> 19:12.051
I need to have other things
going on in my life.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.053
I can't just sit around
waiting for this baby to come

19:14.086 --> 19:17.890
because I just I don't believe
it's actually ever coming.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.594
Come on. The ultrasounds have
been good, you're doing great.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.296
Everything is gonna be fine.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.333
So why don't we want to know
the sex of the baby?

19:26.366 --> 19:29.135
Because we like surprises.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.504
Tobe, we hate surprises.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.273
Do you remember
Madison's birthday,

19:33.306 --> 19:35.007
when that guy jumped out of
the cake and you peed a little?

19:35.041 --> 19:38.144
Okay, human beings are not
supposed to be in baked goods.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.447
Admit it. We don't want to know

19:40.480 --> 19:42.682
if it's a boy or girl
because we're terrified.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.185
And we don't want to talk about
it because we're terrified.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.822
Kate...

19:49.856 --> 19:52.024
You know, let's forget it.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.193
Let's eat.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.798
RANDALL: And then there were
the bus stops that used to run

19:58.831 --> 20:00.533
through our district
that just disappeared.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.569
And Sol Brown
did nothing about it.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.137
Once again, Randall Pearson
has his facts about me wrong.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.974
No, all due respect,
I've seen my tenants return home

20:08.007 --> 20:10.510
bone tired after walking
miles from work.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.978
And that's a fact.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.382
They wanted to eliminate
the entire 112 route.

20:15.415 --> 20:19.185
I convinced SEPTA to consolidate
a few stops instead

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
so the people would have
something instead of nothing.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.826
No, I did not.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.496
Well, I'm sure it's hard to keep
abreast all the way from Alpine.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.400
-It's again with
the Alpine, man, you...

20:40.707 --> 20:45.244
Look, you all...
you all have seen my flyer.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.915
You know that I was adopted
by a white family in Pittsburgh.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.150
With all due respect, I'm not
sure what your upbringing

20:51.183 --> 20:54.020
has to do with balancing
city budgets or taxes.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.688
Actually, it has everything
to do with it.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.857
-Actually, it doesn't.
-No, but actually it does.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.959
Now, you got to say your piece,
brother Brown.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.529
Give me a chance to say mine,
if you would.

21:07.767 --> 21:13.540
As I was saying, I was adopted
by a white family in Pittsburgh.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.242
I know what it's like
to have people look at you

21:16.275 --> 21:18.611
like you don't belong,

21:18.645 --> 21:21.080
to overlook you,
to underestimate you. To...

21:25.084 --> 21:27.219
Is this all just to tell us
you're the best candidate

21:27.253 --> 21:29.088
'cause you were
overlooked as a kid?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.657
I'm not the best candidate
because I'm overlooked,

21:30.690 --> 21:32.058
Mr. Brown,
I'm the best candidate

21:32.091 --> 21:34.293
because the 12th district is.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.603
Now, you've all been overlooked,
taken for granted,

21:43.636 --> 21:45.772
underestimated by
this councilman,

21:45.805 --> 21:49.008
who thinks he can ignore you
until it's election time,

21:49.041 --> 21:50.443
and then announce
some initiative

21:50.477 --> 21:52.244
from up on this stage,
like he's some--

21:58.818 --> 22:01.020
You know what?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.671
I've been reading the minutes
from the last four

22:18.705 --> 22:22.341
city council
public meetings, okay?

22:22.375 --> 22:28.047
Last November,
Elaine Wallace complained

22:28.080 --> 22:30.182
about the water
in her son's school.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.952
Yes.
-AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes. Yeah.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.587
And Sol said he'd look into it.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.389
That was over a year ago.

22:36.423 --> 22:40.326
James Wallace told him that
his snow wasn't getting plowed.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.094
He couldn't even
make it to work.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.997
He came back to complain
three more times.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.966
-Damn right, I said it.
-Thank you, sir.

22:46.999 --> 22:52.104
Helen Farmer couldn't get
a ten-month-old pothole fixed.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.942
Grace Wright couldn't get
an access ramp at her building.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.111
The list is endless.

22:59.145 --> 23:02.114
The "I'll look into its"
are endless.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.319
I, uh...

23:07.353 --> 23:09.689
This is a complicated job,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.991
and I will have a lot to learn.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.226
But I can promise you this.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.863
I will never let them take
eight of your bus stops

23:16.896 --> 23:18.631
just because they leave you
with three.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.672
I will fight side by side
with you for better schools,

23:25.705 --> 23:29.208
fair housing and for more jobs.

23:30.977 --> 23:34.647
I will fight to make sure
that your snow gets plowed

23:34.681 --> 23:36.315
in the winter,
and if it doesn't,

23:36.348 --> 23:38.651
I will do more than
just "look into it."

23:38.685 --> 23:40.219
I swear to God that
I will show up,

23:40.252 --> 23:41.588
and I will shovel it with you.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.728
Take a chance on me.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.163
Take a chance on the man
with the shovel.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.233
Take a chance!
Take a chance!

23:54.266 --> 23:58.104
Take a chance. Take a chance.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.117
Well, that was wonderful food.
Right, Kev?

24:11.150 --> 24:14.386
-Ex-- Wonderful. Excellent.

24:14.420 --> 24:19.425
Um, I'd really like to show you
something, if that's okay.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.460
(Trung translating
in Vietnamese)

24:26.633 --> 24:29.135
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.271
That's my dad. Um, he spent
some time here in this village

24:32.304 --> 24:34.807
-when he was in Vietnam.
-Hmm.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.515
His father used to sneak
in the fence every week

24:42.549 --> 24:44.083
to visit him and his mother.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.886
Your father was VC?

24:46.919 --> 24:48.788
VC.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.458
Our fathers fought each other.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.468
You recognize him?

25:04.637 --> 25:08.107
No. No.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.777
Well, uh, what about her, huh?

25:10.810 --> 25:12.612
My father never spoke of her,

25:12.645 --> 25:14.180
but he's got all these
photographs of her.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.215
Do you recognize her?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.626
He does not know her.
She does not live here.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.564
-Yeah.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.875
What's

25:42.909 --> 25:44.944
You make American television.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.180
-Make people laugh.
-Mm.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.782
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.550
Something like that.
I do--

25:51.584 --> 25:53.352
Do
One more look, you don't...

26:02.829 --> 26:04.864
My father was an actor of sorts.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.299
That is,
he was very good at pretend.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.335
When he would sneak back
to visit,

26:09.368 --> 26:10.837
he never told us
he was a soldier,

26:10.870 --> 26:12.204
off fighting a deadly war.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.548
He would say he was off
exploring distant lands.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.016
Fantasy lands.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.452
Other worlds.

26:34.493 --> 26:37.864
He would describe
magical places he had been.

26:37.897 --> 26:42.368
-Places where the sky was green
and animals spoke.

26:46.472 --> 26:50.209
He was a good actor.
Maybe like you.

27:08.695 --> 27:13.432
Our fathers were enemies,
but they were not so different.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.567
They both hid their war stories.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.904
They both pretended to be okay
for their children.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.172
Mm.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.982
And now, here we sit,

27:30.016 --> 27:32.985
happy, healthy, sharing a meal

27:33.019 --> 27:36.055
in a place where
our fathers once fought.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.338
It may not be the answer
you're looking for,

27:52.371 --> 27:55.641
but maybe it's the answer
to something bigger.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.516
Yeah. Maybe.

28:06.886 --> 28:10.556
Thank you.

28:10.589 --> 28:14.360
There you go.
Sorry, this is my last one.

28:14.393 --> 28:18.530
Wow. I can't believe we
handed out all those fliers.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.232
Yeah.

28:28.374 --> 28:32.678
Ooh...

28:32.711 --> 28:34.713
Ooh.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.486
I have this pain in my wrist.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.154
And my neck.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.823
And my back.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.893
Ugh, I've had it since
I was in my 20s.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.862
I have this theory

28:49.896 --> 28:54.366
that I used to keep
all of my emotions

28:54.400 --> 28:59.271
so bottled up that...
it started to affect my body.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.411
I lost a child.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.747
I buried that real deep.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.450
I never talked about it, ever.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.522
And I kept some secrets
from my husband, too.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.826
And from your father.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.261
But you know that.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.729
I'm not proud of that.

29:26.365 --> 29:30.569
At first, it started out with...

29:30.602 --> 29:34.206
a headache,
or an upset stomach.

29:34.240 --> 29:39.311
But eventually, oh,
I started to ache

29:39.345 --> 29:42.815
all the way into my bones.

29:42.849 --> 29:46.385
And I don't want that
for you, sweetheart.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.054
I'm not saying that
you have to go

29:48.087 --> 29:50.256
and have a conversation
you're not ready to have.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.293
You talk to your parents when
you decide the time is right.

29:56.328 --> 30:00.566
You're my first grandbaby,
and I love you so much.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.369
I just don't want you to become
an old woman, like me,

30:03.402 --> 30:08.507
carrying around ibuprofen
in your purse like candy.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.745
Welcome to Harvard.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.814
Or the Harvard
of the San Fernando Valley,

30:15.848 --> 30:18.084
aka Encino Community College.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.086
What are we doing here?

30:20.119 --> 30:21.921
Well...

30:21.954 --> 30:23.789
...you've always said that
you wanted to finish school.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.359
I think the time is now.

30:27.393 --> 30:31.063
Look, I-I know that
we're terrified,

30:31.097 --> 30:33.099
but not buying into
this pregnancy

30:33.132 --> 30:35.267
isn't gonna make it
any less scary,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.603
and it's not gonna make it
hurt any less

30:37.636 --> 30:39.271
if something goes wrong.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.474
You're right, it won't.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.344
Kate,
we're gonna be parents.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.713
We have six months
to jump a bunch of hurdles

30:47.746 --> 30:50.883
before our life becomes
consumed by poop and naps.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.351
And do not say that my life
is already consumed

30:52.384 --> 30:53.852
by poop and naps,
even though it is.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.588
Look, you get this degree,

30:56.622 --> 30:57.924
and I think it closes
a loop for you

30:57.957 --> 30:59.325
that's been open
for far too long.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.160
Better yet, I think
it makes you smile.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.730
And when you smile, the world is
a better place. See?

31:04.763 --> 31:06.298
The world just got
a little better.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.767
And that is the smile
I want us to have

31:08.800 --> 31:11.137
when we talk about our kid
from now on.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.206
That's the smile our kid
is going to inherit from you.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.208
Our kid...

31:18.144 --> 31:21.847
...who is coming,
safely and in good health.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.150
Okay?

31:24.183 --> 31:27.019
So, what do you say?

31:27.053 --> 31:28.554
Hmm.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.856
Where's the bursar's office?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.691
What's a bursar?

31:32.724 --> 31:34.626
The person that you pay
to enroll.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.563
Mm... I don't think
that's a word.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.897
Yes, it's a word.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.632
I don't have a college degree,
and I know that.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.836
-Hey.
-You Serena'd the crap
out of that debate.

31:44.870 --> 31:47.006
Mwah.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.407
-Mm-hmm.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.808
Yeah, you really did.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.410
I'm hearing lots
of positive feedback.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.779
-Great.
-Mm-hmm.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.248
All right, so why are you guys
staring at me

31:56.282 --> 31:57.283
like my breath stinks?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.387
While you were up there,
I got the results

32:01.420 --> 32:03.722
from the most recent poll.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.892
Um, I'm sorry, Randall,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.627
unfortunately,
Brown is too far ahead.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.597
More than we expected,
by a lot.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.565
But you saw the people in here.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.001
And the election's not
for weeks.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.936
We don't have the time.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.305
You're not gonna win
this one, Randall.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.040
The numbers aren't there.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.774
I'm sorry.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.612
Huh.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.621
Annie passed out
in a pile of flashcards.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.656
Just said good night to Tess,

32:37.689 --> 32:40.092
still can't get more than
two words out of her.

32:40.126 --> 32:43.095
-Sulking in her room.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.831
-No. Deja.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.503
I want to go see my mom.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.505
She lives in Delaware
and she has a job

32:53.539 --> 32:55.274
and I would like
to go visit her.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.842
If that's okay.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.715
Okay.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.285
BETH:
We'll figure it out.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.020
We'll look at our calendars

33:08.054 --> 33:10.956
and find a time
when one of us can take you.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.960
Okay. Thanks.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.628
Good night.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.364
RANDALL:
Night, Dej.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.303
-That is gonna be...
-Complicated.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.038
TESS:
Mom

33:26.072 --> 33:28.707
It's like an adolescent girl
conveyor belt in here.

33:28.740 --> 33:32.778
You okay, honey?
What's up, honey?

33:32.811 --> 33:36.982
Nothing. Um...

33:37.015 --> 33:39.351
It's just...

33:39.385 --> 33:42.454
I'm sorry I've been
so weird lately.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.858
I just...

33:46.892 --> 33:50.496
I feel uncomfortable
around you guys

33:50.529 --> 33:52.864
all of a sudden.

33:52.898 --> 33:57.269
I have a stomachache
all the time.

33:57.303 --> 34:00.239
-I don't want to keep secrets.
-Oh, hey.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.475
It's okay. You can tell us.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.179
Um...

34:07.213 --> 34:09.615
People, um, at school

34:09.648 --> 34:12.584
have been having
crushes and stuff.

34:12.618 --> 34:16.021
And lots of girls

34:16.054 --> 34:19.024
have boyfriends,

34:19.057 --> 34:21.059
but I don't want one.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.131
That's perfectly okay.
You know, in fact,

34:25.164 --> 34:27.366
it's long been a dream of mine
that you never, ever...

34:27.399 --> 34:30.502
It's because I think
I might like girls,

34:30.536 --> 34:32.538
not boys.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.812
But I don't know.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.582
Maybe I don't.

34:43.615 --> 34:46.885
It's just... I didn't want
to tell you guys

34:46.918 --> 34:51.257
because I didn't want it
to become a thing.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.826
RANDALL:
Hey, Tess. Tess.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.828
Listen.

34:56.862 --> 35:00.065
We're your parents.
We're here to help you.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.635
-I know...
-In a very cool,

35:03.669 --> 35:07.406
laid-back kind of way,
without it becoming a thing.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.911
We love you

35:12.944 --> 35:16.848
no matter what, okay?

35:16.882 --> 35:19.285
Look at me.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.052
You see me?

35:21.086 --> 35:23.722
Look at your dad.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.425
You see him?

35:28.494 --> 35:30.896
Do you see anything
other than two people

35:30.929 --> 35:35.133
who love you more than any two
people could ever love anyone

35:35.167 --> 35:38.069
in the entire world?

35:46.312 --> 35:47.513
Okay.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.581
Thanks.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.084
Um...

35:53.118 --> 35:56.955
I don't really want
to talk about it anymore.

35:56.988 --> 36:01.227
-Not right now, anyway.
-Okay. Cool.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.296
But if you change your mind,
we're here.

36:07.132 --> 36:09.134
Night, Tess.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.549
And I thought I wasn't
gonna have wine tonight.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.522
Thanks.

36:33.692 --> 36:37.162
I don't know if I saw
that one coming. Did you?

36:37.195 --> 36:39.531
Nope.

36:45.904 --> 36:49.408
You know, I'm sorry
about the campaign, baby.

36:49.441 --> 36:53.312
But maybe this is
a blessing, you know,

36:53.345 --> 36:55.381
-that-that it's over.
-Hey.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.850
You know what they say,
it's not over till it's over.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.321
Sorry, babe,
but it-it feels like it's over.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.155
But he didn't say
I should drop out.

37:04.189 --> 37:07.626
Not in those words, but...

37:07.659 --> 37:10.862
Tess is going through
some major stuff right now.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.799
And Deja wants
to reconnect with her mom.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.102
I wanted this for you, babe.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.970
You know I did.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.707
I agreed to stretch our finances
to pay for the campaign,

37:21.740 --> 37:23.575
I-I took on more
around the house

37:23.609 --> 37:26.044
in the thick of my job search.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.847
But things are getting
really complicated

37:28.880 --> 37:30.516
and I-I can't afford to have you

37:30.549 --> 37:33.018
off chasing
some impossible dream.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.287
I made promises
to a community, Beth.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.694
You told me that,
if at any point

37:42.728 --> 37:46.332
I wasn't on board with
you running, you would stop.

37:46.365 --> 37:50.101
I am no longer on board
with you running.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.678
I understand.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.115
And I love you.

38:04.149 --> 38:07.553
And this family will always
be my priority.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.655
But I need to see this
through, Beth.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.796
Damn, Randall.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.198
Maybe you can't win
this campaign,

38:20.231 --> 38:25.003
but you sure did learn
how to talk like a politician.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.757
Listen, I'm sorry I dragged you
all the way out here

38:45.791 --> 38:49.060
for... well, for nothing.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.329
-Yeah.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.565
Kevin, w...

38:53.599 --> 38:56.535
we went to the same place
your father fought a war.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.505
We-we walked the same land
he walked.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.007
That has to count for something,
doesn't it?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.109
I could've handled
an unpredictable ending.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.578
You know? But I...

39:06.612 --> 39:08.647
I didn't think I'd go home
with nothing.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.684
Well, maybe it's not the ending.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.853
Maybe we're just in the middle.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.794
Hey, Doc.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.795
You seen my brother?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.831
Negative, Sarge.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.169
Hey.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.938
You guys seen Nicky?

39:32.971 --> 39:34.039
No, Sarge.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.240
-Sorry, Sarge.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.749
*

40:12.578 --> 40:15.681
*

40:26.424 --> 40:28.226
Ready?

40:28.259 --> 40:30.228
You let your mom know
we're on the way?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.030
I'll call her from the car.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.732
Okay.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.668
Two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, one, two.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.604
Three, four, five, six...

40:38.637 --> 40:40.906
Hey, boss. Tess called.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.609
-Says they're on the way.
-Okay, yeah.

40:43.642 --> 40:48.413
We're all going to see
Randall's mother.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.415
Oh, did you bring the
Pin The Tail On The Donkey

40:50.448 --> 40:53.284
from my office? Thank you.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.053
I promised I'd bring it.

40:55.086 --> 40:58.456
-And up.
-Yes. Nice adjustment, dancers.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.192
TOBY:
How do the people at the bakery

41:01.226 --> 41:02.561
know what we're gonna have?

41:02.594 --> 41:05.463
Dr. Jasper's office calls
and tells them the gender.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.398
It's, like, a thing people do.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.801
Huh. What a world.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.071
Okay.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.973
-Okay.

41:21.446 --> 41:24.015
*

41:26.151 --> 41:28.153
Oh, my God, it's a boy.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.822
-Blue means boy.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.924
-We're having a boy.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.832
Murillo, what happened?!

41:40.866 --> 41:44.069
A boat exploded. I think one of
our guys was on it!

41:44.102 --> 41:46.104
*

41:57.616 --> 42:00.652
I was going to suggest something
you could bring home from here,

42:00.686 --> 42:03.955
perhaps to lay on your war
memorial for your uncle one day.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.523
But I must've misheard

42:05.557 --> 42:08.126
because none of your family
died in the war.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.328
My Uncle Nick did.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.063
He died over here in the war.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.800
Hmm.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.268
Whoa, hold on,
so what

42:17.302 --> 42:18.970
What's "hmm" mean?

42:19.004 --> 42:21.707
I went to a database
for the war memorial.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.610
Nicholas Pearson. 46th Infantry.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.244
His name's not there.

42:26.277 --> 42:29.514
He might be dead, but he didn't
die here in Vietnam.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.050
Not in the war, anyway.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.187
