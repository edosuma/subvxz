00:03.618 --> 00:05.225
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Awesome.

00:05.226 --> 00:06.785
- Don't touch those.
- Both: Oh!

00:09.030 --> 00:11.731
They're apology waffles for Ben.

00:12.050 --> 00:13.738
Well, I'm mad at you too.

00:14.493 --> 00:15.643
For what?

00:15.644 --> 00:17.271
For not giving me any waffles.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.046
Good morning.

00:19.047 --> 00:21.345
Oh, there they are,

00:21.687 --> 00:24.453
miracle one and miracle two.

00:24.454 --> 00:25.450
Well, what about me?

00:25.451 --> 00:27.468
It was a miracle I got you out of me.

00:28.501 --> 00:30.511
Mom, there aren't enough
waffles in Manhattan

00:30.512 --> 00:31.374
to make up for the fact

00:31.375 --> 00:32.253
that you brought Emma's mom

00:32.253 --> 00:33.750
back into our lives last night.

00:33.751 --> 00:35.816
Oh, you're right. You're right.

00:36.653 --> 00:38.079
What about toast?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.565
Huh?

00:39.566 --> 00:41.041
Riley's gonna be here any minute.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.238
How am I supposed to start a new romance

00:42.239 --> 00:44.076
when my old one's crashing on the couch?

00:44.077 --> 00:45.802
Well, some of that may have been avoided

00:45.803 --> 00:47.247
if you hadn't actually said,

00:47.248 --> 00:49.469
"hey, want to crash on our couch?"

00:51.082 --> 00:52.878
What am I supposed to do?

00:53.735 --> 00:55.624
I mean, Angela did give me Emma.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.634
And if I didn't have
Emma, what would I have?

00:58.635 --> 01:00.572
A much less complicated love life.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.197
She said she just wants to
spend some time and reconnect.

01:04.935 --> 01:06.272
I can't say no to that.

01:06.273 --> 01:07.585
Why not?

01:07.586 --> 01:10.234
I mean, what do we even
know about this girl

01:10.779 --> 01:13.580
other that she's kind of
trampy and pretty fertile?

01:17.312 --> 01:19.410
We can't leave Emma alone with her.

01:19.411 --> 01:21.392
(Laughs) I'm not.

01:21.393 --> 01:22.811
You're gonna keep an eye on Angela

01:22.812 --> 01:25.245
while I keep an eye on my
relationship with Riley.

01:25.246 --> 01:27.340
Hey, should we really be
calling this little thing

01:27.341 --> 01:29.807
you got going on with Riley a relationship?

01:29.808 --> 01:31.340
I mean, it was just a kiss, right?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.029
(Laughs) You don't know
the power of my kiss.

01:35.765 --> 01:36.830
Knock knock.

01:36.831 --> 01:37.785
Hey.

01:37.786 --> 01:38.815
Hi.

01:43.007 --> 01:44.301
- There you go.
- (Awkward laugh)

01:45.013 --> 01:46.200
See?

01:47.767 --> 01:51.221
So, how did it go with Angela after I left?

01:51.222 --> 01:52.770
Fine, yeah, all good.

01:52.771 --> 01:54.909
Look, Ben, if you need some time

01:54.910 --> 01:57.698
to sort all of this out,
I totally understand.

01:57.699 --> 01:59.264
There's nothing to sort out.

01:59.265 --> 02:00.848
Angela is not gonna be a problem.

02:00.849 --> 02:02.618
You won't even notice she's around.

02:02.619 --> 02:03.859
Morning!

02:03.860 --> 02:06.962
Aww, there's my little family.

02:06.963 --> 02:08.800
Hey, Ben, you mind if I
get dressed in your room?

02:08.801 --> 02:10.137
Hi, ri.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.029
So, so far I'm noticing.

02:28.752 --> 02:31.134
so, ah? What do you think?

02:31.135 --> 02:33.090
I kind of feel like a superhero.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.673
It's a bird.

02:36.674 --> 02:37.792
It's a plane.

02:37.793 --> 02:39.919
It's questionable-fashion man.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.063
Well, I have to do something.

02:42.064 --> 02:43.888
It's either wear these
until I get them removed

02:43.889 --> 02:46.483
or find two new girlfriends
named Amy and Riley.

02:46.484 --> 02:47.568
Ugh, yeah.

02:47.569 --> 02:49.335
The sooner they're both gone, the better.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.956
Maybe it'll help wash
off some of that stench

02:50.957 --> 02:53.344
of breakup you've got clinging to you.

02:53.345 --> 02:54.473
That's just my shampoo.

02:55.985 --> 02:56.994
No.

02:56.995 --> 02:59.475
It's a combination of
heartbreak and roadkill.

02:59.476 --> 03:00.864
No woman will come near it,

03:01.506 --> 03:03.506
which means I should probably move myself

03:03.507 --> 03:04.966
to another table.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.619
You don't know what you're talking about.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.750
I'm fine.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.439
How could you be?

03:10.835 --> 03:12.295
Dude, the love of your life

03:12.296 --> 03:13.937
just hooked up with your brother

03:13.938 --> 03:15.026
and the girl you've been dating

03:15.027 --> 03:17.166
for the past three months
just dumped your ass.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.095
Man, maybe I'm not fine.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.809
Exactly.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.795
But I am going to rebuild you

03:24.796 --> 03:27.776
using my patented
five-step Tucker process.

03:27.777 --> 03:30.045
T-U-C-K-E-R.

03:30.396 --> 03:31.524
That's six steps.

03:31.525 --> 03:33.400
I couldn't think of anything for "T."

03:33.898 --> 03:36.238
Okay, "T," terminate all memories.

03:36.239 --> 03:39.453
Okay, e-mails, sappy photos, texts.

03:39.454 --> 03:41.986
I know what "K" is for.
It's "keep out of my business".

03:41.987 --> 03:43.402
I can handle this on my own.

03:47.801 --> 03:49.566
Hey, isn't Ben supposed
to be working today?

03:49.567 --> 03:50.974
Oh, he took the afternoon off

03:50.975 --> 03:53.025
so he could take a few other things off...

03:54.000 --> 03:55.417
Of Riley.

03:58.461 --> 03:59.907
Okay, what do those
letters stand for again?

03:59.908 --> 04:02.019
That's what I thought.

04:06.748 --> 04:08.362
I'm not moving too fast, am I?

04:09.078 --> 04:11.788
Ben, we've spent the last 20 years

04:11.789 --> 04:13.432
getting to know each other.

04:13.433 --> 04:15.082
It's not too fast.

04:15.706 --> 04:16.887
(Laughs)

04:16.889 --> 04:18.233
I like the way you think.

04:18.678 --> 04:20.937
In fact, um...

04:20.938 --> 04:22.920
Maybe we should move things into your room

04:23.453 --> 04:25.368
and we can move too fast there.

04:27.175 --> 04:29.133
I really like the way you think.

04:30.281 --> 04:31.588
Wait, wait, wait.

04:32.035 --> 04:33.350
Is it too fast?

04:34.182 --> 04:35.965
Is this a mistake?

04:35.966 --> 04:38.396
I always say just go
with your first instinct.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.774
I just...

04:40.775 --> 04:42.883
I don't want things to
get weird between us.

04:42.884 --> 04:44.390
Well, there's one way to solve that.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.814
Make sure there's nothing between us.

04:46.815 --> 04:48.758
- (Both chuckle)
- Ben...

04:50.074 --> 04:54.156
What if the thought of us
is better than the real us?

04:55.066 --> 04:58.343
I mean, what if we go
out and it gets awkward?

04:58.344 --> 04:59.640
And so we can't hang out anymore

04:59.641 --> 05:00.910
and I can't go by the bar.

05:00.911 --> 05:02.268
And suddenly, I can't see Danny,

05:02.269 --> 05:03.582
you know, because he's taking sides.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.203
So to get over it, I
have to move to Denver.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.976
But I hate the cold, so I end up in Miami.

05:06.977 --> 05:08.047
And suddenly, I have this closet

05:08.048 --> 05:09.758
full of winter coats that I can't wear.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.482
And what am I going to do
with all of those coats?

05:14.781 --> 05:18.123
Honestly, you lost me at Denver.

05:21.829 --> 05:23.801
I just really want it to be special.

05:23.802 --> 05:25.505
Look, I do too.

05:25.506 --> 05:28.016
So why don't I plan us
the perfect first date?

05:28.017 --> 05:29.800
And we'll just see where it goes.

05:29.801 --> 05:31.922
And we can take it as slow
as you want to take it.

05:32.357 --> 05:34.206
You just let me know when you're ready.

05:36.099 --> 05:37.372
Okay.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.160
"Okay" as in you're ready?

05:41.350 --> 05:44.008
No? I didn't think so.

05:44.009 --> 05:45.634
Boop. (Chuckles)

05:48.096 --> 05:50.150
Are you ready to have
your life transformed?

05:50.151 --> 05:52.069
Are you ready to be tuckered?

05:53.360 --> 05:55.110
- Tucker me.
- Yeah.

05:55.892 --> 05:57.787
- (Phone beeps)
- There.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.342
"T" is now complete.

05:59.343 --> 06:02.028
I have just terminated all
of Amy's contact info...

06:03.722 --> 06:06.539
As well any one else's
name who starts with "a."

06:06.540 --> 06:07.903
Tucker!

06:08.360 --> 06:09.910
Wow, that was fast.

06:10.819 --> 06:13.063
So either you didn't do it...

06:13.471 --> 06:15.559
Or you didn't do it right.

06:16.733 --> 06:19.796
We decided to take it slow
to make sure it's special.

06:20.281 --> 06:23.082
Okay, so I hear the words,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.325
but I have no idea what you're saying.

06:26.273 --> 06:28.024
I'm saying this is different.

06:28.025 --> 06:28.988
This is Riley.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.417
I don't want to do anything to screw it up.

06:30.418 --> 06:32.172
And I'm already teetering on the brink.

06:32.487 --> 06:33.891
Oh great, here comes the brink now.

06:35.098 --> 06:37.004
Hi, ladies. Hi, Emma.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.912
How was your big day out with mama?

06:39.425 --> 06:41.331
Well, it was a little rough.

06:41.332 --> 06:43.351
You know how Emma is around strangers.

06:46.018 --> 06:47.513
Hey, why don't you buy me lunch

06:47.514 --> 06:49.900
and I'll tell you all
the secrets of parenting.

06:49.901 --> 06:53.132
Hard work, patience, and proximity.

06:55.643 --> 06:58.215
I thought Ben was spending
the afternoon with Riley.

06:58.216 --> 06:59.424
They're such a cute couple.

06:59.425 --> 07:01.484
Well, they're hardly a couple.

07:01.485 --> 07:03.552
I don't think it's even been 24 hours.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.492
Really? Good to know.

07:06.937 --> 07:08.477
Yeah, but then again,

07:08.478 --> 07:09.957
that's almost twice as long

07:09.958 --> 07:11.687
as you and Ben went out.

07:13.187 --> 07:14.742
Look, I know it was just one night,

07:14.743 --> 07:16.881
but does Ben ever talk about me?

07:16.882 --> 07:18.545
I've actually thought about him a lot.

07:18.546 --> 07:21.440
Oh, oh no. We all talk about you.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.865
"Where's Emma's mom? I
wonder where she lives."

07:25.493 --> 07:26.407
Okay, look, lady.

07:26.408 --> 07:27.670
I know I've made some mistakes.

07:27.671 --> 07:28.701
(Laughing) Okay, yeah.

07:29.227 --> 07:30.799
Um...

07:33.429 --> 07:34.866
But you have to understand.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.735
I didn't have all the love
and support that Ben has.

07:37.736 --> 07:40.279
I didn't have an
incredible, selfless mother

07:40.280 --> 07:42.731
who would do anything for me.

07:45.223 --> 07:47.190
Well, who does really?

07:49.123 --> 07:51.092
Other than Ben...

07:51.511 --> 07:53.014
And Jesus.

07:54.692 --> 07:56.290
Seriously, guys, am I just kidding myself

07:56.291 --> 07:58.111
that Riley and I could ever work?

07:58.112 --> 07:59.638
Well, I don't want to be all negative,

07:59.639 --> 08:01.179
but I wouldn't get my hopes up.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.465
Dude, you know what your problem is, right?

08:04.821 --> 08:07.514
You've just got to get past naked.

08:07.515 --> 08:09.416
Yo, man, baby on board.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.883
- What?
- I forgot, my bad.

08:10.884 --> 08:12.379
- Get past naked?
- Yeah,

08:12.380 --> 08:14.101
once you've seen each other naked,

08:14.102 --> 08:15.431
it won't be that big of a deal

08:15.432 --> 08:17.014
and everything will be cool...

08:18.089 --> 08:19.382
Or not.

08:20.462 --> 08:22.746
That is truly the worst
idea I've ever heard.

08:22.747 --> 08:24.676
I like it.

08:24.677 --> 08:26.171
And that proves it.

08:28.229 --> 08:29.978
I'm sorry, get past what?

08:30.367 --> 08:31.860
Naked!

08:32.683 --> 08:34.539
And this is your idea of
the perfect first date?

08:35.193 --> 08:37.246
Well, sort of.

08:37.972 --> 08:39.433
But even if we go on the perfect date,

08:39.434 --> 08:41.524
which we will, we'll
still have the same issue.

08:42.025 --> 08:44.231
So I'm just putting it out there

08:44.232 --> 08:47.190
that maybe we should just put it out there.

08:48.088 --> 08:50.215
Ben, that is truly not...

08:50.216 --> 08:52.289
Nearly as crazy as it sounds.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.382
Actually, that kind of makes sense.

08:55.383 --> 08:57.157
It does? Really?

08:57.158 --> 08:58.337
I thought for sure you'd never...

08:58.338 --> 08:59.790
stop talking, Ben.

09:01.406 --> 09:03.087
Okay, so, so, should we just like...

09:04.629 --> 09:07.919
No, I can't just do it in front of you.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.405
Okay, maybe I need to explain again

09:09.406 --> 09:10.687
how this is supposed to work.

09:10.688 --> 09:14.030
Just let me get undressed in your room.

09:14.749 --> 09:16.897
Okay, we'll count to ten.

09:16.898 --> 09:18.929
Oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing this.

09:19.546 --> 09:21.022
Right, one...

09:21.023 --> 09:22.077
oh, so we're doing it now?

09:23.111 --> 09:24.167
- Two.
- Okay.

09:25.254 --> 09:26.486
Three.

09:27.853 --> 09:28.989
Four.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.753
Come on, stupid high-tops!

09:30.754 --> 09:33.098
- Five.
- And that's why I know a lot of cops.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.245
You can't be here right now.

09:35.246 --> 09:36.880
Where's Riley? I thought you
two were going out tonight.

09:36.881 --> 09:38.831
- Yeah, me and Riley are both...
- Ten!

09:40.528 --> 09:42.192
(Screams)

09:46.519 --> 09:48.028
So annoying.

09:48.029 --> 09:50.375
Even when she runs, nothing jiggles.

09:53.899 --> 09:55.286
Seriously?

09:55.287 --> 09:57.274
Get past naked?

09:58.305 --> 09:59.800
The only thing more romantic

09:59.801 --> 10:01.222
would be the backseat of a car

10:01.223 --> 10:02.947
and a cop's flashlight in your face.

10:04.799 --> 10:06.445
God, those things are bright.

10:10.475 --> 10:13.147
Well, I'll have you know it was working

10:13.148 --> 10:14.996
until you showed up with you know who.

10:15.682 --> 10:19.076
Ben, this is Riley we're talking about.

10:19.479 --> 10:22.011
She's not some random
girl you meet in a bar

10:22.012 --> 10:23.550
that becomes the mother of your child.

10:24.829 --> 10:26.326
I know I have to do something special.

10:26.327 --> 10:27.212
Yeah.

10:27.213 --> 10:28.582
It needs to be the kind
of thing that we remember

10:28.583 --> 10:30.112
for the rest of our lives.

10:30.113 --> 10:31.103
Well, if that's the criteria,

10:31.586 --> 10:33.703
I'd forget anything having
to do with margaritas.

10:35.055 --> 10:36.837
What was his name?

10:38.754 --> 10:40.402
You know, a restaurant just seems so blah

10:40.403 --> 10:42.302
and a day in the park is so cliche.

10:42.303 --> 10:43.948
Pablo, yes.

10:45.217 --> 10:47.046
Ugh, that would have
kept me up all night...

10:48.034 --> 10:49.666
Just like Pablo.

10:50.604 --> 10:52.096
- Mom!
- Sorry, sorry.

10:52.712 --> 10:54.239
You know, I better go get Emma ready

10:54.240 --> 10:56.270
before that strumpet blows back in.

10:56.271 --> 10:58.071
One prodigal mother diapered up

10:58.072 --> 10:59.495
and reporting for baby duty.

10:59.496 --> 11:01.167
Hey, mom just went in to get her ready.

11:01.168 --> 11:03.857
Ah, probably teaching her how
to spit up on me on command.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.719
But I'm not letting up
until I win her over.

11:08.171 --> 11:10.020
How close am I to winning you over?

11:10.021 --> 11:11.168
I can honestly say that I'm happy

11:11.169 --> 11:12.722
that Emma's gonna get to know her mom.

11:12.723 --> 11:13.798
Thanks.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.961
I just wish there was some
way we could start over.

11:16.482 --> 11:19.248
You know, that's a good
idea, starting over.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.820
That's actually a really good idea.

11:25.657 --> 11:28.367
You are a very smart girl.

11:28.368 --> 11:30.121
Thank you. I'll see you later.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.535
(Giggles)

11:34.478 --> 11:37.125
Okay, she is all ready to go.

11:38.010 --> 11:39.375
(Crowd chatters)

11:43.824 --> 11:44.975
(Tucker sighs)

11:44.976 --> 11:47.472
Happy hour... or as I like to call it,

11:47.473 --> 11:49.048
the dating buffet.

11:49.646 --> 11:52.072
And tonight, it is
all-you-can-meet.

11:53.152 --> 11:54.472
All right, where were we?

11:54.473 --> 11:56.100
"T," done. Wow.

11:57.196 --> 11:59.875
Nice job on terminating
those tattoos, by the way.

11:59.876 --> 12:02.017
Yeah, it's a good thing I
had a two-for-one coupon.

12:05.062 --> 12:06.922
All right, now on to the letter "U".

12:06.923 --> 12:09.137
New underwear, got 'em, wearing 'em,

12:09.138 --> 12:10.628
- feeling good.
- Whoo.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.821
- All right.
- "C," cocktails.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.209
- Aah. What's next?
- Whoo.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.710
"E," engage.

12:17.711 --> 12:20.188
Also known as picking up a hot stranger.

12:20.189 --> 12:21.566
It's my favorite step.

12:21.979 --> 12:23.369
Oh.

12:23.370 --> 12:24.641
I got this.

12:26.730 --> 12:28.339
Hey, I'm Danny.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.641
I'm trying to meet a girl
to help me get over my ex.

12:30.642 --> 12:32.055
I used to have her name
tattooed on my wrist.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.214
Oh my God, do you smell smoke?

12:38.215 --> 12:39.321
I do...

12:39.322 --> 12:41.245
'Cause you just crashed and burned.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.705
Oh, hey, Riley, nice to see you.

12:46.362 --> 12:48.947
Nice to see me? Really?

12:48.948 --> 12:51.456
So did Ben tell everyone I was naked?

12:51.457 --> 12:53.660
Not everyone, just me and the waitresses.

12:56.103 --> 12:58.330
But he did leave you this.

12:59.905 --> 13:00.994
Thanks.

13:04.902 --> 13:06.356
Hey, Riles, what's up?

13:06.357 --> 13:07.709
I'm just hanging out here at happy hour

13:07.710 --> 13:10.098
fighting off the babes. It's crazy.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.278
Oh, that's nice, Danny.

13:13.691 --> 13:14.510
Oh, my God.

13:14.511 --> 13:15.523
Just when I think your brother

13:15.524 --> 13:17.186
is the biggest idiot on the planet,

13:17.187 --> 13:19.407
he turns around and
does something so sweet.

13:19.958 --> 13:21.081
He's planned a scavenger hunt

13:21.082 --> 13:23.696
of all the places that
mean something to us.

13:23.697 --> 13:26.541
And the first place is where
he ditched me on the subway.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.998
How cute is that?

13:27.999 --> 13:29.623
Adorables.

13:31.032 --> 13:32.166
I'll see you later.

13:34.696 --> 13:37.417
Ben, hello?

13:37.418 --> 13:39.202
Last clue says to meet you here.

13:40.922 --> 13:42.340
Anyone?

13:44.000 --> 13:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:52.217 --> 13:54.578
- (Clicks)
- Hey, it's me.

13:54.579 --> 13:56.391
What we need to do is start over.

13:56.392 --> 13:58.911
So if you're interested,
meet me in room 430

13:58.912 --> 14:01.523
at the b street hotel. I'll be waiting.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.940
Oh, and wipe your feet on the doormat...

14:18.941 --> 14:20.612
Or as you like to call it,

14:20.613 --> 14:23.064
- the baby dump.
- Okay, seriously, Mrs. Wheeler.

14:23.065 --> 14:24.524
I carried Emma around for nine months

14:24.525 --> 14:26.372
and shoved her out with zero painkillers.

14:26.373 --> 14:29.045
I'm pretty sure I can go
solo for a couple of hours.

14:29.046 --> 14:31.179
All right. All right, fine.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.144
Yeah, I will just put Emma down

14:33.145 --> 14:35.377
and then I will be on my way.

14:35.378 --> 14:38.236
And by "on my way," I
mean right across the alley

14:38.632 --> 14:40.323
where I can see everything.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.660
Hey, it's me.

14:58.661 --> 15:00.443
What we need to do is start over.

15:00.444 --> 15:02.920
So if you're interested,
meet me in room 430

15:02.921 --> 15:05.419
at the b street hotel. I'll be waiting.

15:20.655 --> 15:22.036
(Pops)

15:23.517 --> 15:25.101
This is going to be perfect.

15:28.092 --> 15:29.552
Tucker: I felt this connection.

15:29.992 --> 15:32.527
- I don't really believe in soul mates...
- Hey, Tucker, I did it.

15:32.528 --> 15:33.601
I'm back.

15:33.602 --> 15:35.329
I just met two flight
attendants over at the bar.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.538
And then I was like, "hey,
maybe Tucker wants one."

15:37.539 --> 15:39.145
O.M.G., I do want one.

15:40.699 --> 15:42.484
Sorry it didn't work out.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.249
They're staying at the hotel upstairs

15:45.250 --> 15:46.609
and just invited us to their room

15:46.610 --> 15:48.404
for a little after-party.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.658
Hotel room, you know what that means.

15:50.973 --> 15:53.145
Tiny fridge, tiny soaps,

15:53.146 --> 15:54.594
big mistakes!

15:55.549 --> 15:57.193
Yeah, they want us to meet
them up there in 10 minutes

15:57.194 --> 15:58.955
in room 421.

16:00.257 --> 16:01.965
Or was it 412?

16:01.966 --> 16:03.961
- Wait, I wrote it on this napkin.
- Oh, good.

16:08.972 --> 16:10.020
(Knocking)

16:10.880 --> 16:12.540
(Muffled) Wait a second!

16:15.890 --> 16:17.286
Come in.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.189
Ben? (Screams)

16:19.190 --> 16:20.462
(Screams)

16:21.923 --> 16:23.222
Angela, what are you doing here?

16:23.223 --> 16:25.076
Well, it's pretty clear what
you think I'm doing here.

16:25.862 --> 16:28.058
God, and I thought you
were fast the first time.

16:28.473 --> 16:30.633
What are you... what are
you doing? The shoes stay on.

16:30.634 --> 16:31.864
You've got this all wrong.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.952
But you said you wanted to start over.

16:32.953 --> 16:34.068
That wasn't for you. That was for ri...

16:34.069 --> 16:35.265
(screams)

16:35.266 --> 16:36.549
God, what is going on here?

16:36.550 --> 16:37.985
Riley, it's not as bad as it looks.

16:37.986 --> 16:39.188
I'm talking about the situation

16:39.189 --> 16:40.984
and not anything else
you might be looking at.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.158
- I can't even.
- Riley, no, wait.

16:46.821 --> 16:48.514
Riley, Riley, Riley.

16:48.515 --> 16:50.285
Please, it's all just
a big misunderstanding.

16:50.286 --> 16:52.280
Obviously, I was in there waiting for you.

16:52.281 --> 16:53.894
- Naked?
- Well, in the spirit

16:53.895 --> 16:56.144
of you showing me yours, I
thought I'd show you mine.

16:57.262 --> 16:58.665
What is Angela doing here?

16:58.666 --> 17:00.655
- I don't know what she's doing here?
- Oh, oh!

17:01.104 --> 17:02.380
Look, there's a giant "R"

17:02.381 --> 17:03.929
written in rose petals on the bed.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.113
Angela doesn't even have an "R" in it.

17:06.114 --> 17:07.549
Tucker: Three simple numbers.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.685
How could you not remember?
What is wrong with you?

17:10.242 --> 17:12.256
Whoa, Ben! Dude, get a room.

17:12.257 --> 17:13.563
Yeah, I'm trying.

17:14.011 --> 17:16.505
Okay, normally, I'd be way
more curious about this,

17:17.018 --> 17:18.266
but you two haven't seen

17:18.267 --> 17:21.104
a couple of hot stews
running around, have you?

17:21.855 --> 17:24.144
No, I can't say that I
have, but you know what?

17:24.145 --> 17:25.536
You might want to check Ben's room.

17:25.537 --> 17:27.477
Excuse me, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

17:27.930 --> 17:30.870
I don't know. It looks like
it might be at the end to me.

17:30.871 --> 17:32.582
Oh, good, there you are.

17:33.876 --> 17:35.543
Oh, honey, just because
you put it under a dome,

17:35.544 --> 17:36.799
doesn't make it special.

17:39.764 --> 17:42.025
Mom, what are you doing here?

17:42.330 --> 17:44.849
I was worried that Angela
might have seen that message

17:44.850 --> 17:46.203
you left for Riley on the laptop

17:46.204 --> 17:47.967
and think it was for her.

17:47.968 --> 17:49.439
I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong

17:49.440 --> 17:51.395
with you and Riley's special night.

17:51.396 --> 17:53.704
Oh, no, no. It's been magical.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.130
Riley, just let me go grab my robe

17:56.131 --> 17:57.549
and we can talk about this, okay?

17:57.851 --> 17:58.894
No, don't close the door!

17:59.195 --> 18:00.346
Oops.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.264
Dude, seriously,

18:03.265 --> 18:05.027
this is not a good look on you

18:05.028 --> 18:07.259
coming or going.

18:10.249 --> 18:12.264
(Elevator music plays)

18:17.698 --> 18:20.384
Really? No one can even
lend me their shirt?

18:22.151 --> 18:24.970
Remind me to never order
room service from this place.

18:25.757 --> 18:27.006
(Elevator dings)

18:31.802 --> 18:32.999
(Elevator dings)

18:33.672 --> 18:35.170
(Camera clicks)

18:38.604 --> 18:41.360
Did you really make a giant
"R" out of rose petals?

18:41.361 --> 18:42.922
Most certainly did.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.777
So does that mean you forgive me?

18:45.235 --> 18:46.806
Most certainly does.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.782
Well, the good news is we got past naked.

18:50.551 --> 18:52.991
Now we just have to try
and do it at the same time.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.083
Maybe this was a bad idea.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.055
How can you say that?

19:00.056 --> 19:01.678
I don't know, it just...

19:01.679 --> 19:03.284
it shouldn't be so hard.

19:03.285 --> 19:04.852
Riley, we're meant to be together.

19:05.158 --> 19:07.168
I know it and I think you do too.

19:07.962 --> 19:10.222
It'll work itself out. I promise.

19:10.671 --> 19:11.765
What about Angela?

19:11.766 --> 19:14.468
Angela has nothing to do with this.

19:14.469 --> 19:16.686
She is just Emma's mom and that's it.

19:16.687 --> 19:18.068
She's a non-factor.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.403
I can't not let her see Emma.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.051
I know, but obviously

19:22.052 --> 19:23.858
she thinks something is going on.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.410
I mean, she wants to start over...

19:26.411 --> 19:29.108
otherwise she never would
have gone to that hotel room.

19:29.109 --> 19:30.536
Hey, she's not dead.

19:33.059 --> 19:35.067
It sounded funnier in
my head. I don't know.

19:37.282 --> 19:39.849
Look, there's no rush.

19:40.302 --> 19:42.228
Whenever or wherever or however

19:42.229 --> 19:44.185
we finally do something special,

19:44.186 --> 19:46.203
it's gonna be special
because it's you and me.

19:52.987 --> 19:54.821
That was pretty special.

19:54.822 --> 19:56.979
Oh, it's gonna get a lot
more special than that.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.888
(Both chuckle)

19:59.289 --> 20:00.732
Just let me say goodnight to Emma.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.067
All right.

20:04.659 --> 20:06.013
Am I too late?

20:06.014 --> 20:07.977
Shh, yeah, I think she's out.

20:08.764 --> 20:10.338
Ben, I am so sorry.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.497
Oh, it's okay.

20:11.859 --> 20:13.064
We'll talk about it in the morning.

20:13.907 --> 20:15.014
Okay.

20:20.730 --> 20:22.239
Angela: God, she's so beautiful.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.936
I can't believe we actually made her.

20:29.340 --> 20:30.988
It amazes me every day.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.830
To the Tucker system.

20:43.831 --> 20:45.349
To the Tucker system.

20:45.350 --> 20:48.176
Turns out "K" stands for
"key" to Ben's hotel room.

20:48.177 --> 20:49.543
Right. (Laughs)

20:49.544 --> 20:52.289

- What do you think is taking so long in there?

20:52.290 --> 20:53.856
(Scoffs) Who knows?

20:53.857 --> 20:55.186
Girl stuff.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.545
O.M.G., that bathtub is huge!

21:01.417 --> 21:02.684
Hey, do you think Ben would mind

21:02.685 --> 21:05.654

21:05.655 --> 21:07.088
Why not?

21:07.089 --> 21:09.250
It is his special night.

21:09.251 --> 21:10.742
(Laughs)

21:10.743 --> 21:12.242
Shove over, boys.
