Hey, where are we going?

02:59.679 --> 03:00.638
Mom.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.640
Mom?

03:02.724 --> 03:03.975
Did you hear what I said?

03:05.476 --> 03:06.311
Mom?

03:11.524 --> 03:12.775
He didn't mean to do it.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.241
I think he did, Mom.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.161
I really think that he did.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.078
No.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.080
He was upset.

03:26.831 --> 03:27.832
He wasn't himself.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.960
He was furious at Danny.

That's what I'm trying to tell you.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.325
Is that Kevin's at Marco's right now,
trying...

04:04.118 --> 04:05.453
to get him to help us.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.960
But I don't know what's gonna happen.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.171

04:41.572 --> 04:43.324

04:48.121 --> 04:49.998
Please tell me you understand, Mom.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.172
Of course I do. I'm not senile.

How about if I drive?

08:03.858 --> 08:04.901
Keep fucking moving.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.081
I need you all in one place.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.834
We all have to be together.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.463
-Mom--
-Find Kevin, find John.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.382
-Tell them to come home right now.
-Kevin is talking to Marco.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.344
- John hasn't been answering his phone--
- Excuse me.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.971
Uh... I'm so sorry. Uh...

08:35.973 --> 08:38.059
Um... You know what? Never mind.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.228
-I'll figure it out.
-That's great, thank you.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.145
Okay.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.316
I mean, just real quick, and forgive me,

08:45.399 --> 08:48.819
but how do I know the difference
between a bad sunburn and sunstroke?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.488
Vomit. Thanks.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.823
-If you could just give us a minute?
-Oh, no, no.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.909
You go, Meg.
I'll take care of Mrs. Samuels.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.203
My husband's doing that. He's throwing up.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.539
-Oh, poor thing, you must be so worried.
-I am.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.874
-I'll come right over with you.
-Okay, thank you.

09:01.958 --> 09:02.792
Mom?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.838
We have a doctor I can call,
he'll be here in five minutes.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.925
Yeah, I kept telling Jonathan
all day on the boat to put on a shirt.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.219
Oh! Why don't they ever listen?

09:13.302 --> 09:14.762
What's wrong with them?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.256
Put the weapon on the ground!

-Listen--
-Hands behind your head.

10:53.903 --> 10:54.779

11:33.901 --> 11:34.735
Oh, fuck.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.321
Hey, Kevin, pick up your damn phone.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.615
Why, dude? Just leave me a message.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.784
--Kevin, it's Meg. Where are you?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.161
Call me back now. Stop fucking around.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.206

11:52.420 --> 11:55.297
You've reached
John Rayburn. Please leave a message.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.924
John, it's me.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.301
Please call me back, okay? Please try me.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.219
Thank you.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.983
I just saw your truck.
It's not looking too good.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.735
I'm happy to give you
a ride back to Largo.

12:19.238 --> 12:23.284
No, that's all right. I called a flatbed
and let my wife know what's going on.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.035
Everything's fine, I'm just waiting.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.205
All right,
I'll, uh, get a call in to animal control.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.249
Should be out in the morning for the body.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.834
Sure you're okay now, Detective?

12:33.377 --> 12:34.420
Yeah, thank you.

12:35.004 --> 12:35.838
Good night.

12:38.132 --> 12:38.966

we didn't take a lot of car trips.

to this game.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.164
Was that a class in law school?
Dumb Questions?

25:01.208 --> 25:04.461
Sorry, I just found out this morning
my mom's really dying.

25:05.921 --> 25:06.963
Whoa, shit, sorry.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.637
You want a drink?

25:14.554 --> 25:15.805
Uh, no, I can't.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.602
Actually, you know what, fuck it.
I could have just a quick one.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.065
Hey, Lannie.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.233
Kevin.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.859
-Yes. Yes, sir.
-All I asked

25:27.943 --> 25:30.362
was for you to abide
by a few simple rules.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.822
-I know, and I fucked that up.
-What time is it?

25:32.906 --> 25:35.617
-I'm such a fucking idiot--
-Is it not past 10 p.m.?

25:36.284 --> 25:38.328
-It is definitely late.
-What does that mean?

25:38.411 --> 25:40.497
-I know, but--
-What do you know?

25:40.580 --> 25:43.333
I can't be here past 10 p.m.,
but you have to understand--

25:43.416 --> 25:44.501
True or false?

25:44.584 --> 25:46.753
You were just caught
sneaking around the docks,

25:46.836 --> 25:48.838
and you maybe saw some things.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.592
True, but you have to understand, sir,
I didn't have a choice.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.386
I didn't know where else to go.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.642
Why those?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.435
Yes.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.229
See? Look, this?

26:04.312 --> 26:06.356
This has nothing to do

26:06.439 --> 26:09.651
with me trying to have anything
to do with your guys,

26:09.734 --> 26:11.319
or whatever you got going here.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.780
Listen, let me tell you
what happened, okay?

26:13.863 --> 26:16.783
I go to see this guy that I know.

26:16.866 --> 26:20.745
This friend of mine--
Well, of my family's, really.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.290
And I went-- I went...

26:23.373 --> 26:26.126
I went to his house-- Oh, Jesus.

26:26.918 --> 26:27.919
I need your help, sir.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.088
-My help?
-I wanted to go talk to him

26:30.171 --> 26:33.174
about why he was treating
my family so badly, right?

26:33.466 --> 26:37.762
And it just kind of, like,
spun out of control, and-- And...

26:38.847 --> 26:42.350
He's-- He's just lying on the floor,
and I don't think he's breathing.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.685
Do not say another word.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.603
-Mr. Gilbert, I need--
-Stop talking.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.355
I have to ask you a favor.

26:47.897 --> 26:52.485
I need you to open your door
and step out of my vehicle.

26:52.902 --> 26:56.740
-Mr. Gilbert, please--
-And this conversation never happened.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.129
- Well, how much blow was he doing?

27:11.212 --> 27:13.381
-No, yeah.
-Yeah, right. Who the hell knows?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.259
He was just talking so fast
in the message.

27:16.343 --> 27:19.888
I remember that the first time
I ever did a bump was with him,

27:19.971 --> 27:22.057
and I was in tenth grade.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.600
Homecoming.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.435
Yes, that's right.

27:25.518 --> 27:28.480
Yeah, I remember
Danny was so pissed at Eric

27:28.563 --> 27:30.940
for getting his little sister,
the prom queen, high.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.610
I didn't know that.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.445
Yeah. Eric thought it was funny,

27:35.862 --> 27:38.365
and Danny didn't talk to him
for, like, a week or two.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.285
I didn't know that.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.124
When is the next bus?

27:48.792 --> 27:49.834
Check the board.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.464
There's nothing on the board.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.299
Then I guess you got your answer.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.593
You mean, there's not another bus?

27:58.676 --> 28:00.804
People lie. Board don't.

28:01.388 --> 28:04.099
You don't have anything going
to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?

28:04.516 --> 28:05.517
Sure, I do.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.979
-Well, I'll take a ticket.
-It'll be 4:50.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.113
The ticket's only $4.50?

28:18.697 --> 28:22.617
Sir, the next bus to Jacksonville
is 4:50 a.m.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.538
-There's nothing any sooner?
-Where you looking to go?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.957
I'm looking to go north or west.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.252
-Any city in mind?
-Yeah, any city that's north or west.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.721
I do got Atlanta at 4:00 a.m.,

28:42.804 --> 28:45.598
Charlotte at, uh, 15 past the hour,

28:46.141 --> 28:48.351
and Mobile by way of Tallahassee...

28:49.060 --> 28:50.979
half past the hour of cinco.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.606
Does any of that wet your whistle, hoss?

28:57.068 --> 29:00.780
...activity well below
the average of 12 named storms,

29:00.864 --> 29:04.993
six hurricanes and three major storms,
suggesting it might be over.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.663
This year a big difference.
The year also introduced...

29:08.747 --> 29:10.832
Okay, wait, wait. So, Eric called you?

29:11.499 --> 29:12.792
Yeah, but I couldn't answer.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.546
I was dealing with this 80-year-old woman,
ruptured spleen.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.091
He sounds really crazy on the message.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.344
It was like he's foaming at the mouth.
He's so mad.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.514
-And he sounds terrified.
-Why?

29:27.307 --> 29:28.767
I don't know.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.895
He needs money, he wants to leave town,
he wants me to call him.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.022
And so, did you call him?

29:34.564 --> 29:35.648
Of course.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.151
And?

29:38.860 --> 29:40.695
And now he's not answering.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.698
I told him I'm here,
so, you know, fuck it.

29:44.866 --> 29:48.703
Yeah, fuck it. These fucking brothers
not answering their fucking phones.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.126
That's my mom. I gotta pee anyway.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.880
-Wait, watch my purse, okay?
-Yeah.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.590
Hey.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.134
I can't find either of them anywhere.

30:03.218 --> 30:07.305
Go to the boatyard, and if he's not there,
go to his house, and bring him here.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.058
Mom, how am I supposed to do that?

30:10.141 --> 30:13.728
-I don't care how you do it. Just do it.
-No. No.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.898
No. I've been calling John,
I've been looking for Kevin everywhere,

30:16.981 --> 30:19.692
nobody's answering their phone,
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.736
-I'm not doing it.
-You do what I tell you.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.531
You do what I tell you, Meg.

30:24.614 --> 30:28.660
You know what? I am so sick
of this shit, I'm not doing it.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.286
Okay? I'm not.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.413
Meg?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.207
- Meg?

30:40.672 --> 30:41.589
Hi, Lannie.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.593
Could I have, um,
a fucking bottle of tequila, please?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.972
Oh, shit.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.245
I'm sorry I woke you up.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.459
I just wanted to tell you
that I love you very much, honey.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.048
I love you and your brother very much.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.633
Always remember that.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.803
Where are you?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.930
Tell Ben that for me, will you?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.099
He's not picking up
and his voicemail's full.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.309
Will you do that for me?

31:34.851 --> 31:36.561
Yeah, sure.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.438
Now?

31:38.855 --> 31:40.440
No, you do it in the morning.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.275
You're okay, though?

31:43.610 --> 31:44.694
Just at work.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.405
Just working late,
and I was thinking about you,

31:47.488 --> 31:48.823
and I want you to know...

31:51.409 --> 31:54.579
that I love you very much, kiddo, okay?

31:56.539 --> 31:57.999
I love you very much.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.418
You can go back to sleep now.

32:00.793 --> 32:01.836
Okay.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.767
You've reached
John Rayburn. Please leave a message.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.602
John, where the fuck are you, man?

32:17.685 --> 32:20.813
Come on. I've been calling you
all fucking night.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.857
You need to meet me, all right?

32:22.941 --> 32:25.276
You need to meet me,
like, right fucking now.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.654
What the fuck, man?
I don't know what to do, John.

32:27.737 --> 32:31.824
Come on, you gotta call me back, man.
I need you, I really fucking need you now.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.035
I wouldn't call if I didn't.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.205
So, call me back,
you fucking prick, come on.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.623
Call me back!

33:14.075 --> 33:15.368
What's gonna happen now?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.247
We're just gonna go forward.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.250
One foot follows the other.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.877
One day after another.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.797
How long is Danny gonna be
in the hospital for?

33:28.214 --> 33:29.424
He'll be home soon.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.010
And we'll have new guests and work to do.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.095
Mom, am I gonna have to answer
any more questions?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.973
Shh. You did good, Johnny.

33:39.017 --> 33:39.934
You all did.

33:40.643 --> 33:43.062
Now, shut your eyes
and try to get some sleep.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.331
You want?

34:02.790 --> 34:03.624
No.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.669
I gotta go.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.339
My cab's here. You want a ride?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.425
No, thank you.

34:12.508 --> 34:13.342
You sure?

34:13.426 --> 34:15.636
I'm gonna call... Mm.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.680
See you later.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.485
Attention, all passengers in the terminal:

34:30.568 --> 34:33.071
♪ Louis got Detroit
And Louis got Philly ♪

34:34.822 --> 34:37.617
♪ When's the last time you heard
A motherfucker rhyme like this? ♪

34:37.700 --> 34:40.369
♪ I'm tryin' to see a mil
Before I'm five times six ♪

34:54.509 --> 34:57.095
So, right now, as we head
towards the top of the hour,

34:57.178 --> 35:00.098
we'd like to get your local Florida temps
across the state.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.268
I was trying to think.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.397
I was trying to think, but I, um...

35:09.357 --> 35:12.401
I couldn't hold onto anything, Mom,
and I, um...

35:15.571 --> 35:18.241
I couldn't even see.
Everything went black. I...

35:20.785 --> 35:23.996
I-I just-- I couldn't see anything.
Just-- just nothing.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.164
And, um...

35:27.667 --> 35:31.337
he turned to me, and he said
that all three of us were going to jail.

35:33.339 --> 35:37.009
I've been trying to call John all night,
and he's not answering my phone calls.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.470
And I don't know what to do,
so I came here.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.014
I don't know what to do.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.936
It's just so fucked up.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.153
Just...

35:57.822 --> 35:58.739
It is.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.331
Yes... it is.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.588
Marco was not getting it,
and he wasn't listening to me at all.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.257
I didn't know where else to go.
I came here.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.520
Come on. One drink won't hurt you.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.565
-Let's get some air.
-Yeah.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.360
Oh, you go ahead, I'm gonna get some ice.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.487
Okay.

37:06.974 --> 37:07.850
What are you doing?

37:08.184 --> 37:09.352
Mom, open the door.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.269
Mom!

37:11.020 --> 37:12.146
Oh, come on.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.065
Mom!

37:14.690 --> 37:15.816
Don't do this!

37:15.900 --> 37:16.734
Mom!

37:19.695 --> 37:20.988
Mom, open the door!

37:24.992 --> 37:27.411
You've reached the voicemail
of Detective Marco Diaz.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.039
If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 911.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.750
Otherwise, leave a message
and have yourself a safe day.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.172
I'm doing it.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.175
Meg, let me give you a ride home.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.427
-I'm--
-Give me a couple minutes.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.304
I need to go see him.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.640
-No, you need to go home.
-I need to go see him.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.185
Just wait right here
for a couple minutes.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.604
Home.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.653
Hello?

38:42.737 --> 38:45.239
John, I need you here.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.035
You've been avoiding
our calls all night. Stop it.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.121
You need to help the family.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.665
There's nothing more important than that.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.043
Come home right now.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.212
Tell me where you are.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.548
I can't.

39:02.923 --> 39:05.426
Yes, you can, and you fucking will.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.678
-Mom.
-How could you, John?

39:14.143 --> 39:15.895
I can't come home.

39:15.978 --> 39:18.272
John, how could you?

39:19.690 --> 39:21.275
How could you lie to me like that?

39:36.332 --> 39:39.251
-We lied.
-I don't want you to think of it that way.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.004
-Should've just went on the boat--
-You helped the family.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.965
-Should've went--
-Nothing's important than that.

39:45.049 --> 39:45.925
We lied.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.343
You helped the family.

39:47.927 --> 39:48.844
We lied.

40:07.488 --> 40:08.697
...door number 2.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.575
Attention, all passengers,
now boarding 134...

40:17.748 --> 40:18.666
Fuck it.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.978
134 passengers,
please board from door number...

40:53.409 --> 40:54.869
Hey, Kev, how's it hanging?

40:56.162 --> 40:57.246
You okay?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.875
-Kev?
-Yeah, yeah.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.293
-Uh...
-What's up?

41:02.376 --> 41:05.796
-Um, uh... I'm here...
-Oh, there's ice cream if you want.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.174
-to see if, uh, John...
-It's Scoonie's birthday.

41:08.257 --> 41:09.550
Is John here?

41:10.384 --> 41:11.218
No.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.596
- Hey, Scoonie?
- Hm?

41:13.679 --> 41:15.723
-You, uh, heard from Rayburn?
-Nope.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.143
But his mother called looking for him.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.687
Everything cool?

41:27.735 --> 41:30.196
Yeah, everything is-- Everything is good.

41:31.155 --> 41:31.989
Thanks.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.287
Hey, you ever read
The 48 Laws of Power? Huh?

41:39.246 --> 41:41.790
'Cause everybody in the joint
is so into that shit.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.003
Not me, man.
I can't get past the fourth law.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.924
You know what I mean?
Always say less than necessary.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.009
You know, you, you got that down.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.401
I know you're not taking me out here
to propose to me.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.363
Or are you? Are you gonna propose to me?

42:12.947 --> 42:14.365
Come on, man, you wanna swing?

42:15.032 --> 42:18.369
I'll swing with you, I don't give a shit.
Nobody's looking. Come on.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.829
Wanna get into it?
Come on, I'll pull it out.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.376
Fuck!

43:17.303 --> 43:19.263
I'm doing whatever I can to help him.

43:22.474 --> 43:23.309
Good.

43:24.351 --> 43:25.185
Thank you.

43:27.146 --> 43:30.149
So, we're all squared up, then?

43:30.608 --> 43:31.650
No, Roy.

43:33.152 --> 43:34.361
Not even close.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.700
You know what? Fuck you.

43:40.743 --> 43:43.996
You're losing everything 'cause you killed
your fucking brother, asshole.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.169
Go ahead.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.421
Anything to protect
the fucking Rayburn name.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.214
Right?

43:55.591 --> 43:58.177
...70 degrees.
Fort Myers...

44:01.513 --> 44:03.599
Oh, you fucked up but good, son.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.228
The way I see it,
you only have two options.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.938
One, you turn yourself in.

44:11.273 --> 44:13.817
That's a guaranteed outcome, checkmate.

44:14.860 --> 44:20.240
Option two, you let me get you
some help with this, right now.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.288
73 degrees right now...

44:26.372 --> 44:27.539
Final boarding call...

44:35.714 --> 44:37.549
I can't guarantee it'll all work out,

44:37.633 --> 44:41.261
but at least it'll give you
a fighting chance to save yourself,

44:41.345 --> 44:42.429
your family.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.309
Watch your baby son born,
see him grow up.

44:47.393 --> 44:51.021
...boarding call.
Next departure is in two hours.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.318
Wait!

45:03.325 --> 45:06.703
Either path you take,
there's no turning back.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.581
Yeah, John, this is Kevin again.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.583
Where the fuck are you, man? Um--

45:13.210 --> 45:16.004
John. Come on,
I need to talk to you.

45:16.422 --> 45:19.425
Call me back. Mom is fucking freaking out.
I can't deal with it.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.761
I can meet you wherever you are.
Just call me or text me, okay?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.304
Jesus. Please--

45:24.888 --> 45:25.973
Time's up.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.268
John, where the fuck are you, man?

45:29.351 --> 45:30.561
Call me ba--

45:30.644 --> 45:32.604
You have to decide, Kevin.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.405
