WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.004
HEY, HEY.
HEY.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.306
I BROUGHT SOMEONE HOME
FOR DINNER.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.408
OH, PLEASE, NOT ED.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.377
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT GUY HAS AGAINST THE FORK,

00:09.410 --> 00:11.179
BUT I JUST--I CAN'T
WATCH HIM EAT ANYMORE.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.847
NO. I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY LITTLE FRIEND.

00:13.881 --> 00:17.651
AW.
AND FOUR OF
HIS UNFORTUNATE BUDDIES.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.053
AS THEY SAY, ANY SPECIES,

00:19.087 --> 00:22.090
THE PLUMP AND THE SLOW
ARE THE FIRST TO GO.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.225
(laughs) GREAT.
ANOTHER THING TO PLUCK.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.060
YOU WANT ME TO FREEZE
THE HEART AND LIVER?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.928
EH... HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.698
GIVE MUFFIN THE LIVER.
(barks)

00:30.731 --> 00:33.267
HOW CAN A HEART BE FROZEN
WHEN YOU'RE HERE TO WARM IT UP?

00:33.301 --> 00:34.268
AW.

00:34.302 --> 00:38.206
YOU ARE SO SWEET
AFTER A KILL.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.507
HEY, GUYS.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.609
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.111
BECAUSE STUDIES HAVE LINKED

00:43.144 --> 00:44.878
HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
TO CANCER.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.248
LOLLIPOPS ARE
THE CIGARETTES OF TODAY.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.749
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
YOU GONNA GIVE A SPEECH?

00:48.782 --> 00:50.184
WHERE'S THE SOAPBOX?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.586
UH, IT'S WHEREVER YOU LEFT IT.
YOU WERE USING IT LAST.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.090
OH, MOM, CAN YOU GET THIS
OUT OF HERE BEFORE BOYD SEES IT?

00:56.124 --> 00:59.059
I DO NOT WANT HIM KNOWING
THAT HIS FOOD ONCE HAD A FACE.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.428
KRIS, YOU'VE BEEN HUNTING
WITH ME BEFORE.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.062
WHERE'S HE THINK
MEAT COMES FROM?

01:02.096 --> 01:03.397
THE MAGIC MEAT FAIRY?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.266
(scoffs)
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.435
IT'S THE BEEF GENIE.
RIGHT.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.069
MAYBE BOYD SHOULD LEARN
THE HARSH REALITIES

01:09.103 --> 01:10.771
OF WHERE FOOD COMES FROM.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.906
I MEAN, WHY FILL HIS HEAD
WITH THESE FAIRY TALES?

01:12.940 --> 01:15.943
BECAUSE HE'S 5?

01:15.976 --> 01:17.778
5-YEAR-OLDS ENJOY FAIRY TALES.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.547
BESIDES,
BOYD IS A REALLY PICKY EATER.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.914
THIS MIGHT SCARE HIM
OFF EATING

01:20.948 --> 01:23.151
ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS
HE LIKES--MEAT.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.152
HOLD ON. ACTUALLY...

01:24.185 --> 01:25.753
I AGREE WITH MIKE.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.754
WHAT?
ARE YOU HIGH?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.556
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.090
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.725
WE SHOULDN'T BE FILLING
BOYD'S HEAD WITH FAIRY TALES.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.960
WAIT--REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY,
RIGHT?

01:32.993 --> 01:34.895
YOU AGREE WITH ME,
AND I CHANGE MY POSITION?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.564
LISTEN, I'M NOT
THE ONE THAT'S 5.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.666
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.
I AGREE WITH YOU.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.601
WE SHOULD ALWAYS
TELL CHILDREN THE TRUTH.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.336
OKAY. WHY DON'T WE GET
THE LITTLE BASTARD IN HERE

01:42.370 --> 01:45.339
AND EXPLAIN
HOW THIS THING HAPPENED?
HONEY, DON'T SAY THAT.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.641
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME TO TEACH BOYD

01:47.675 --> 01:49.109
HOW THE MEAT HE EATS

01:49.143 --> 01:50.944
COMES FROM THE SLAUGHTERING
OF INNOCENT ANIMALS.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.079
THIS DUCK WAS NOT INNOCENT.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.183
HE WAS FLYING AWAY
FROM SOMETHING PRETTY FAST.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.752
RYAN, THIS IS CRAZY, OKAY?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.121
SEEING THAT DEAD DUCK
WILL TRAUMATIZE BOYD.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.324
YEAH, MAYBE JUST ENOUGH
TO TURN HIM OFF MEAT FOR GOOD.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.125
AND THAT WAY, WE CAN GET HIM
TO BECOME A VEGAN.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.961
OR AT THE VERY LEAST,
A VEGETARIAN.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.597
YOU ARE ALREADY A PAIN
IN THE ASS TO COOK FOR.
YEAH.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.299
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE
ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE HOUSE.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.834
YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY,
VEGANISM'S NOT THAT NATURAL.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.169
WE WATCHED A THING ON CABLE

02:15.203 --> 02:17.438
ABOUT A SUBSPECIES OF CAVEMAN
THAT WAS CALLED--

02:17.471 --> 02:18.939
THEY WERE THE, UM...

02:18.972 --> 02:20.841
AUSTRALOPITHECUS SEDIBA.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.445
THOSE PEOPLE.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.347
THEY DIDN'T EAT MEAT,

02:26.380 --> 02:28.816
AND THEY DIED OUT
2 MILLION YEARS AGO--

02:28.849 --> 02:31.185
ALL OF THEM,
EXCEPT MAYBE ONE.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.056
WHOA. WHAT'S THAT?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.792
UH... SUNDAY NIGHT'S DINNER.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.661
LOOKS LIKE
A DEAD BIRD TO ME, BOYD.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.163
LIKE THAT ONE THAT FLEW
INTO OUR SLIDING GLASS DOOR.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.998
REMEMBER HOW
IT SUFFERED, BUDDY?

02:45.032 --> 02:49.237
AND DADDY HAD TO CALL
THE LANDLADY TO TAKE IT AWAY?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.571
LISTEN, BOYD,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.906
A LOT OF THE MEAT YOU EAT
COMES FROM ANIMALS.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.142
LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF...
HOLD ON--KRIS--
NO, DAD, CAN WE NOT
DO THIS RIGHT NOW, PLEASE?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.077
JUST--LOOK. HEY, BOYD?
LOOK AT THIS.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.646
YOU LIKE HAMBURGER, RIGHT?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.682
THIS... (imitates cow mooing)
COMES FROM COWS.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.552
YOU LIKE, UH, HAM? SO DO I.
OINK, OINK. COMES FROM PIGS.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.919
THAT'S WHERE
THE MEAT COMES FROM.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.188
YOU LIKE HOT DOGS--YOU KNOW
WHERE THAT COMES FROM?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.090
DOGS?!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.092
NO, NO.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.327
IT'S DELICIOUS
BEEF BY-PRODUCTS

03:13.361 --> 03:15.263
WRAPPED IN A LITTLE CASING.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.565
YEAH, LIKE EYELIDS, EARS,
LIPS, AND INTESTINES.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.433
MMM. WHO'S HUNGRY?

03:19.467 --> 03:22.536
LISTEN, THE POINT IS,
A LOT OF THE FOODS WE EAT

03:22.570 --> 03:25.673
COME FROM DELICIOUS ANIMALS
LIKE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.608
OKAY. COOL.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.178
WHAT?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.413
(high-pitched voice) YEAH, I'D
LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE,

03:32.446 --> 03:33.747
BUT I GOTTA SLIP OUT
OF THESE FEATHERS

03:33.781 --> 03:34.982
INTO AN ORANGE GLAZE.

03:37.084 --> 03:40.988
-- Captions by VITA --

03:44.124 --> 03:45.793
SO THEN I MATCHED RECEIPTS
AGAINST INVENTORY,

03:45.826 --> 03:48.028
AND THESE ARE THE AREAS
WE'RE BEING HIT BY SHOPLIFTERS.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.062
I GOT THIS...
YEAH.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.432
BUT HERE--
THAT'S RIVER RAFTING.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.035
SOMEBODY WALKED OUT OF HERE
WITH A KAYAK.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.906
TRY HIDING A 12-FOOT BOAT
DOWN YOUR PANTS.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.576
I DO IT EVERY DAY, ED.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.778
(knock on door)

04:04.812 --> 04:06.113
HEY, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
MR. ALZATE?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.981
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH. KYLE, COME HERE.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.451
UH, TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS BOARD, ALL RIGHT?

04:10.484 --> 04:15.122
ALL RIGHT, THE DOTS REPRESENT
THE INSTANCES OF SHOPLIFTING.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.957
AND THE COLORS SIGNIFY
THE DATES WHEN THEY OCCURRED.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.125
WOW.
YEAH.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.560
THINK IT'S THE WORK
OF ONE MAN?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.061
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.331
GUESS WHICH ONE MAN WAS WORKING
THOSE AREAS THESE DAYS?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.965
I WOULD HATE TO BE...

04:26.033 --> 04:28.035
KYLE.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.605
AND YET YOU GET UP
AND DO IT EVERY DAY.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.477
I JUST REMEMBERED. THIS ONE--
THAT WASN'T SHOPLIFTING.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.947
I DROVE A FORKLIFT INTO A PALLET
OF KEROSENE LANTERNS.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.283
THOUGHT I SAW A BEE.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.853
IT WAS JUST A SCRATCH
ON MY GOGGLES. I WAS KIND OF...

04:48.689 --> 04:50.824
(clears throat)

04:50.858 --> 04:52.225
COME HERE.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.630
YOU'RE A GREAT KID, KYLE.
HUH?

04:56.664 --> 04:59.633
WITH A TRUSTING, TRUSTING SOUL,
ALL RIGHT?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.436
BUT PEOPLE OUT THERE
ARE LOOKING TO ROB US BLIND.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.538
YOU HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT, SON.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.839
ALL RIGHT.
(chuckles)

05:05.873 --> 05:07.475
THANKS, MR. ALZATE.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.709
I KNOW YOU WON'T.
I KNOW YOU WON'T.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.479
LISTEN, YOU'RE LIKE
FAMILY TO US, HUH?

05:11.512 --> 05:12.846
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.817
WE NEED TO FIRE THAT KID.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.023
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
MIGHT FIRE KYLE.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.125
HE'S LIKE FAMILY.
IT'S ED.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.027
FAMILY DOESN'T MEAN
THE SAME THING TO HIM.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.029
HE'S HAD FOUR WIVES.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.735
THAT DUDE IS USED
TO A LOT OF TURNOVER.

05:34.768 --> 05:38.238
WAIT, KRIS, ISN'T KYLE
THAT DOOFUS YOU USED TO DATE?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.410
SEEMS LIKE
SHE GOES FOR A TYPE.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.045
GUYS, COME ON IN. DINNER.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.415
OH, FINALLY. I'M STARVING.
HEY!

05:47.448 --> 05:51.785
JEEZ.
GOT A LOT OF ENERGY
FOR A GUY WHO LIVES ON LEAVES.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.090
HEY, COOL NEW JACKET.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.726
OH, THANKS. JUST GOT IT.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.327
LET ME GUESS.
OUTDOOR MAN?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.530
KYLE'S SECTION?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.165
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.700
I ENJOY SHOPPING
IN ALL SECTIONS

06:06.734 --> 06:08.769
OF THE OUTDOOR MAN STORE.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.838
YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU SHOP
IN KYLE'S SECTION,

06:10.871 --> 06:13.040
YOU HAVE A WAY
OF NOT PAYING FOR STUFF.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.074
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M STEALING.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.109
WE GET A 20% OFF
FAMILY DISCOUNT, RIGHT?

06:16.143 --> 06:19.279
SO INSTEAD OF BUYING THINGS
AND TAKING 20% OFF,

06:19.312 --> 06:23.917
I JUST WALK OUT WITH 20% OF WHAT
I WOULD NORMALLY BUY, SO...

06:23.951 --> 06:25.919
BUT KYLE'S IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

06:25.953 --> 06:29.022
OKAY. I'LL TAKE IT BACK
IN THE SPRING, OKAY?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.357
OKAY, I'M TELLING MOM.
NO, NO!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.092
I'LL TAKE IT BACK TOMORROW.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.197
MIKE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO SAY GRACE,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.933
I CAN TAKE MY QUINOA
AND WAIT OUTSIDE.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.068
YOU BETTER GRAB A COAT.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.471
SOMETIMES MY GRACE
TAKES THREE HOURS.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.206
I GOT GRACE COVERED.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.275
I SAID "GOD BLESS IT"
ABOUT 30 TIMES

06:48.308 --> 06:50.611
WHILE I WAS PLUCKING
THESE GUYS.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.480
WHAT IS THIS?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.981
IT'S DUCK, SON.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.583
BOYD, TRY YOUR POTATOES,
SWEETIE. HERE.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.951
IS IT THE ONE GRANDPA SHOT?

06:57.985 --> 07:00.588
YEP. THE POOR LITTLE DUCKY
WAS FLYING HOME

07:00.621 --> 07:02.923
TO SEE HIS WIFE
AND DUCKLINGS...

07:02.956 --> 07:05.759
WHEN HE WAS
BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.064
ACTUALLY, THIS BIRD DIED
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS BEAK.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.933
HE WAS SINGLE.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.434
HONEY...

07:14.468 --> 07:17.671
HE JUST HADN'T MET SOMEONE
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOUR GRANDMA.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.675
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.743
RYAN!

07:22.776 --> 07:23.677
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

07:23.711 --> 07:24.812
WHAT?
COME ON, COME ON.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.446
CAN WE ALL
JUST EAT IN PEACE, PLEASE?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.948
HA! WITH A VEGAN
AND A HUNTER IN THE HOUSE,

07:27.981 --> 07:30.350
THE OVER-UNDER ON THAT IS "NO."

07:30.383 --> 07:33.086
I DON'T WANT TO EAT THIS.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
(Mike) BOYD, SIT BACK DOWN
HERE. BOYD.
(Kristin) GREAT.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.256
GOD, THANKS A LOT,
YOU TWO.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.257
WHAT DID I DO?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.626
"NO MORE FAIRY TALES.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.993
LET'S TEACH HIM
THE HARSH REALITIES OF LIFE"?

07:40.027 --> 07:42.129
I'M NOT THE ONE
THAT SAID "QUACK, QUACK."

07:42.162 --> 07:43.096
I WAS JUST TEACHING HIM

07:43.130 --> 07:44.865
THAT EATING A DEAD ANIMAL
IS DISGUSTING.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.067
THE DISGUSTING PART'S
WHAT'S IN THE GRAVY.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.538
BOYD ONLY EATS TWO THINGS--
PASTA AND MEAT.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.705
NOW WE'RE DOWN TO ONE.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.306
OKAY, SO WHIP HIM UP
SOME PASTA, THEN.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.642
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?
OOH!

07:54.675 --> 07:57.678
"WHIP HIM UP SOME PASTA!"
AHH!

07:57.711 --> 08:00.648
NICE TIMING
TO GROW SOME GIBLETS.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.159
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

08:12.192 --> 08:12.960
GOOD NIGHT, BOYD.
(kisses)

08:12.993 --> 08:14.862
YOU KNOW, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.063
HEY, I WANNA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.166
IS IT SOMETHING
YOU SHOT?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.167
COME HERE.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.969
SEE THESE SHARP TEETH
RIGHT HERE?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.671
UH-HUH.
I GOT TWO OF 'EM.
YOU HAVE 'EM, TOO.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.072
THEY'RE CALLED
CANINE TEETH.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.139
AND GOD GAVE US THOSE TEETH

08:26.173 --> 08:28.742
SO WE COULD RIP THE FLESH
OFF OTHER ANIMALS.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.145
IT'S LIKE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.513
LIKE "THE LION KING"?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.248
JUST LIKE "THE LION KING."

08:37.084 --> 08:39.319
LOOK AT HERE.
SEE THE FISH?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.921
FISH CATCHES THE WORM,

08:40.954 --> 08:42.590
WE CATCH THE FISH,
WE EAT THE FISH.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.091
WHO EATS US?

08:44.124 --> 08:44.992
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.526
WE'RE THE TOP
OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.563
AND SINCE WE'RE AMERICANS,
WE'RE AT THE VERY TOP.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.600
THAT'S NOT A CIRCLE.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.035
NO, IT'S NOT A CIRCLE.
WELL, HERE...

08:55.068 --> 08:56.870
FISH EATS THE WORM,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.371
MEN EAT THE FISH,

08:58.405 --> 09:01.441
THEN WHEN WE DIE,
THE WORMS EAT US.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.846
WE'RE GONNA DIE?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.514
UH...

09:07.547 --> 09:10.417
UM, IN--IN A LONG TIME
FROM NOW.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.086
YOU'RE GONNA DIE?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.789
OH, BOY. YEAH.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.025
MOMMY'S GONNA DIE?
OH...

09:18.058 --> 09:19.860
NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.929
AM I GONNA DIE?!

09:23.230 --> 09:25.398
NOT FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.
LONG TIME.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.200
WHAT ABOUT MUFFIN?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.236
NOT AS LONG.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
NO!

09:33.006 --> 09:36.143
BOYD!
MOMMY! MOMMY!

09:36.176 --> 09:37.210
MOMMY!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.211
WHAT--
HEY.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.813
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

09:39.847 --> 09:49.890
WE HAD A LITTLE BEDTIME CHAT
ABOUT DEATH.

09:49.890 --> 09:59.900
WE HAD A LITTLE BEDTIME CHAT
ABOUT DEATH.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.477
HEY, MANDY.
HEY! HI.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.311
YOU OUGHT TO GET
THAT JACKET.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.412
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.650
I KNOW. I USED TO
HAVE ONE JUST LIKE IT.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.151
UH, HOW ARE YOU, KYLE?

10:18.185 --> 10:21.288
WELL, NOT GREAT.
OH.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.691
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF.
I MIGHT GET FIRED.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.258
WHY DO PEOPLE STEAL?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.493
I DON'T KNOW.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.461
UM, MAYBE THEY JUST
LOOK REALLY CUTE IN STUFF

10:28.495 --> 10:30.998
THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD,
AND THEIR DAD RECENTLY--

10:31.031 --> 10:33.300
RECENTLY CUT THEIR ALLOWANCE
BECAUSE OF POOR GRADES.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.704
YOU KNOW?
IT'S JUST ONE THEORY.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.539
UM, WHAT KIND OF STUFF
HAVE THEY BEEN TAKING?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.474
UH, A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING.
UH-HUH.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.843
FROM RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.712
SUNGLASSES.
WOW, YEAH.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.880
PROBABLY JUST
WALKED RIGHT OUT.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.716
LITTLE STUFF LIKE THIS.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.550
PROBABLY, LIKE,
EASY TO CONCEAL.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.485
(clinking)

10:52.519 --> 10:55.055
AND SOMEBODY WALKED OUT OF HERE
WITH A KAYAK.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.224
(laughs) YEAH,
I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.194
I WONDER IF IT'S THAT GUY

11:01.228 --> 11:02.863
I HELPED CARRY
A KAYAK TO HIS CAR?

11:04.431 --> 11:05.699
(exhales deeply)

11:05.733 --> 11:08.368
HEY, KYLE? I'M GONNA
HELP YOU SAVE YOUR JOB.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.138
ALL RIGHT. NUMBER ONE RULE
ABOUT SHOPLIFTERS IS

11:11.171 --> 11:13.473
TRUST NO ONE, ALL RIGHT?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.643
NOW CHECK OUT
THOSE TEENAGE GIRLS.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.547
I REALLY SHOULDN'T.
WE HAD A SEMINAR ABOUT THAT.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.583
KYLE--UH, WITH GIRLS, YOU REALLY
HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.353
OKAY, AND IF THE HOT ONE
STARTS TALKING TO YOU,

11:26.386 --> 11:28.021
THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION

11:28.055 --> 11:31.191
IS THAT HER FRIENDS
ARE RIPPING YOU OFF.
WOW.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.526
THAT'S A REALLY SMART
AND HURTFUL TIP.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.097
YOU'RE LIKE AN EXPERT
IN SHOPLIFTING.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.331
I GUESS GROWING UP
AROUND HERE,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.033
YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL, HUH?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.770
YEAH, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.008
SO BOYD'S TEACHER ASKED HIM
TO PUT AWAY HIS BLOCKS,

11:48.041 --> 11:51.745
AND HE SAID, "WHY?
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE ONE DAY."

11:54.147 --> 11:55.715
HE'S GOT A POINT.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.118
(switch clicks)
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
ON ANYONE'S BUCKET LIST?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.287
PUTTING THEIR BLOCKS AWAY.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.721
OH, HONEY.
COME ON, ADMIT IT.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.390
YOU WENT A LITTLE BIT
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.293
WE HAD THE DEATH CONVERSATION
WITH THE GIRLS. IT WAS OKAY.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.761
YEAH, BUT THEY
WERE A LOT OLDER.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.764
AND WE STILL
HAVEN'T TOLD MANDY.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.534
WAIT A MINUTE.
I REMEMBER GIVING IT TO EVE

12:14.567 --> 12:17.237
WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT BOYD'S AGE.
IT WAS WHEN JOHNNY UNITAS DIED.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.471
AND SHE WAS
ALL RIGHT WITH THIS.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.773
NO, NO, NO, HONEY,

12:19.807 --> 12:20.874
SHE WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.475
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WAS A MESS.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.911
NOT EVEN FUNNY.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.045
(switch clicks)

12:25.078 --> 12:26.279
WE GOTTA TOUGHEN
THESE KIDS UP.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.747
OTHERWISE, WE'VE JUST GOT
A BUNCH OF BABIES.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.216
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.417
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.785
DON'T EVEN GO THERE!

12:35.088 --> 12:37.490
CONGRATULATIONS. MY SON WON'T
LET ME TURN OFF THE LIGHT

12:37.524 --> 12:39.226
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID
HE'S GOING TO DIE...

12:39.259 --> 12:41.161
(Mike groans)
(clenches teeth)
AND THAT WORMS WILL EAT HIM.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.395
WORMS?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.730
OH.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.998
MWAH.
WHAT?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.433
OH!
TAG, YOU'RE IT.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.500
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.769
TO SLEEP. I HAVE
A 5:00 A.M. SHIFT.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.805
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.340
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME COCOA.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.507
YEAH, THAT'LL PUT HIM
TO SLEEP.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.110
FINE, I'LL MAKE A CUP
FOR BOYD, TOO.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.779
MAKE SURE HE GETS THE ONE
WITHOUT THE SCHNAPPS IN IT!

12:59.813 --> 13:01.081
AHH.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.349
(switch clicks)

13:02.382 --> 13:04.751
ALL RIGHT. SORRY.
KIND OF SCARED, HUH?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.319
UH-HUH.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.587
YOU DON'T--

13:07.620 --> 13:09.789
YOU DON'T WET THE BED
WHEN YOU'RE SCARED, DO YA?

13:11.558 --> 13:14.294
SOMETIMES.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.464
HEY, WHY DON'T WE SCOOTCH YOU
OVER TO GRANDMA'S SIDE?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.203
LISTEN. COME HERE.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.505
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SCARED OF DYING.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.506
HOW COME?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.008
BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS
ARE LUCKY.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.111
WHEN WE DIE, WE GO
TO A REALLY GREAT PLACE.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.312
IT'S A LOT OF FUN THERE.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.814
LIKE THE PARK?
BETTER THAN THE PARK.
COME ON.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.384
THE SWINGS
SWING THEMSELVES,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.019
THE SLIDE GOES ON FOREVER,

13:39.052 --> 13:43.556
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO
CAT POOP IN THE SANDBOX.

13:43.590 --> 13:47.227
IT'S CALLED HEAVEN.
IT'S--IT'S A GREAT PLACE.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.463
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE
THAT YOU LOVE IS THERE.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.664
LIKE YOU AND MOMMY?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.000
OH, YEAH.
WE'LL BE THERE, YEAH.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.334
AND DADDY?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.802
WELL, IF HE LANDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE

13:55.835 --> 13:58.005
OF SOME POLICY ISSUES,
YEAH.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.839
HE'LL GET THERE.
HE'LL GET THERE.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.374
YEAH, OF COURSE
HE'LL BE THERE.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.044
YOU KNOW, IT'S HEAVEN. IT'S
THE GREATEST PLACE EVER, KID.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.645
IT REALLY IS.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.881
I CAN'T WAIT TO DIE.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.518
NO, YOU WANNA LIVE
A LONG TIME.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.519
A LONG, LONG TIME.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.987
YOU WANNA LIVE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.223
YOU WANNA REMIND GRANDPA
THAT HE SAID THAT

14:16.256 --> 14:17.324
WHEN HE'S SITTING
IN THIS BED

14:17.357 --> 14:20.493
WITH MACHINES AND HOSES
ATTACHED TO HIM.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.862
AH, YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT WHEN YOU GET OLDER.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.899
STUFF JUST STOPS WORKING.
IT'S HORRIBLE GETTING--

14:25.933 --> 14:28.735
HEY, WHY DON'T WE GO TO SLEEP?
LET'S GO TO SLEEP.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.037
WILL YOU TELL ME A STORY?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.372
SURE, I WILL.
COME OVER HERE.

14:32.405 --> 14:36.876
UM, ABOUT THE GREAT KING,
RONALD REAGAN.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.547
I HEARD THAT ONE
ALREADY.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.415
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE PILLOW!

14:42.449 --> 14:45.418
LISTEN, COME OVER HERE.
LISTEN. OKAY.

14:45.452 --> 14:49.289
THE GREAT... CLOSE YOUR EYES.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO SLEEP.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.125
THE GREAT KING, RONALD REAGAN,

14:52.159 --> 15:01.068
WHO SLAYED
THE IDIOT PEANUT FARMER.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.102
OKAY, REMEMBER, KYLE,

15:02.135 --> 15:03.403
IF YOU'RE GONNA
SPOT SHOPLIFTERS,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.772
EVERYONE'S A SUSPECT, OKAY?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.441
HEY. CHECK OUT THAT GUY
AT 3:00.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.877
ALL RIGHT.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.512
WHAT DO I DO TILL THEN?

15:17.617 --> 15:18.952
NO, IT'S...

15:18.986 --> 15:21.221
REMEMBER RULE NUMBER 7
FOR SPOTTING SHOPLIFTERS?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
IT'S--IT'S LIKE
THE OPPOSITE OF NORMAL LIFE--

15:23.256 --> 15:25.458
YOU PAY ATTENTION
TO THE FAT PEOPLE.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.262
NOW THAT YOU MENTION,

15:29.296 --> 15:31.464
HE WASN'T THAT BIG
WHEN HE CAME IN BEFORE.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.234
EXCUSE ME, SIR?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.235
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.503
NO, I'M GOOD, THANKS.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.805
IT'S JUST THAT YOUR HEAD
IS ABNORMALLY SMALL

15:38.838 --> 15:41.808
FOR SUCH A LARGE BODY.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.410
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO DISROBE.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.744
EXCUSE ME?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.013
OH, IT'S JUST THAT I BELIEVE

15:46.046 --> 15:48.015
YOU MAY BE CONCEALING ITEMS
UNDERNEATH YOUR COAT.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.250
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED
IN MY LIFE.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.318
I'M SORRY.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.186
WHY WOULD YOU ACCUSE ME
OF SUCH A HORRIBLE THING?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.954
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.356
NO! NO, YOU'RE NOT, KYLE.
HE IS.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.293
HEY, SHOW'S OVER, BUDDY.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.928
YOU LIED TO ME.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.165
YEAH, THE SHOPLIFTERS
ARE GONNA DO THAT.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.267
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.369
GOOD WORK, KYLE.
GOOD WORK.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.370
LISTEN TO ME--

16:10.403 --> 16:11.938
YOU SET FOOT
IN THIS STORE AGAIN,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.640
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP
IN THE GORILLA HABITAT

16:13.673 --> 16:14.641
AT THE DENVER ZOO

16:14.674 --> 16:17.444
WEARING BANANA-SCENTED
LINGERIE.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.446
COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU,
A 42 LONG?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.381
COME ON. GET OUT OF HERE.
GO ON. COME ON. SCRAM. COME ON.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.449
HANG A LEFT.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.816
(exhales deeply)

16:23.850 --> 16:25.818
YOU WERE RIGHT, MANDY.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.289
THE WORLD'S A CESSPOOL,
JUST OVERFLOWING WITH CESS.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.958
AND PEOPLE ARE JUST PADDLING
AROUND ON TOP OF IT

16:31.991 --> 16:34.061
IN STOLEN KAYAKS.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.331
THANK GOD THERE'S STILL
GOOD PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

16:39.899 --> 16:44.337
UM, I'M NOT ACTUALLY
SUCH A GOOD PERSON, KYLE.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.006
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
COMING IN HERE ON YOUR SHIFT

16:47.040 --> 16:49.142
AND SWIPING STUFF.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.878
WOW.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.314
DID SEEM LIKE YOU'D BEEN
COMING AROUND A LOT.
YEAH.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.516
SORT OF THOUGHT
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON ME.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.685
EW! (laughs)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.653
NO. NO. SORRY.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.356
THAT'S...
THAT'S NOT IT.

17:03.390 --> 17:08.027
I'M SORRY
FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.596
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU MADE UP FOR IT.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.031
TOLD THE TRUTH.
YOU APOLOGIZED.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.700
YOU HELPED ME SAVE MY JOB.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.570
AND ONLY A NICE PERSON
WOULD DO THAT.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.206
YOU THINK I'M NICE?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.574
YES. I THINK YOU'RE NICE.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.842
AND SMART.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.380
NO ONE'S EVER
CALLED ME THAT BEFORE.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.550
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.388
I THINK YOU'RE NICE
AND SMART, TOO, FOR NOTICING.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.689
THANKS.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.325
YEAH.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.428
SIR, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT KAYAK.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.231
(man) NO, IT'S OKAY. I GOT IT.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.400
KYLE! ASK TO SEE
A RECEIPT FIRST!

17:53.106 --> 17:54.474
I NEED TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU, MIKE.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.042
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.044
I REALLY WOULD, BUT I'VE GOT
A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING

17:58.077 --> 18:00.046
WITH THIS COLD BEER.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.047
(clink)

18:01.080 --> 18:02.249
"HOW WAS YOUR DAY?"

18:02.282 --> 18:03.250
"I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT MY DAY

18:03.283 --> 18:05.818
AS SOON AS
I TAKE YOUR TOP OFF."

18:05.852 --> 18:07.554
(fizzes)

18:07.587 --> 18:08.755
WHY WOULD YOU
TELL BOYD ABOUT HEAVEN?

18:08.788 --> 18:09.989
WEREN'T YOU THE GUY WHO SAID

18:10.022 --> 18:11.658
WE SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING HIM FAIRY TALES?

18:11.691 --> 18:14.060
WELL, BECAUSE HEAVEN'S
A REAL PLACE TO ME.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.495
LIKE YOUR APARTMENT'S
A REAL PLACE.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.398
WHY DON'T YOU GO THERE?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.134
LOOK, KRISTIN AND I ARE
RAISING BOYD WITHOUT RELIGION.
(grunts)

18:21.168 --> 18:23.270
WHY SADDLE A KID
WITH ALL THAT GUILT AND SHAME?

18:23.303 --> 18:24.437
IT'S ALL NONSENSE.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.738
WH-WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.841
IN THIS HOUSE,
RELIGION ISN'T NONSENSE.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.909
VANESSA, YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE
THIS STUFF?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.746
WELL, HEAVEN DOESN'T
CONTRADICT SCIENCE.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.115
LOOK, WE'RE MADE OF ENERGY,
AND ENERGY TRANSFORMS.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.850
IT DOESN'T GET DESTROYED.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.420
IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S RARELY USED.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.123
OKAY, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
OUR ENERGY GOES UP TO HEAVEN

18:44.157 --> 18:46.626
AND JUST SITS AROUND
PLAYING THE HARP?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.361
DON'T GET HER
ALL LIT UP, KID.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.898
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT
THE AFTERLIFE FIRST-HAND.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.202
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE OUR ENERGY GOES,

18:55.235 --> 18:57.537
BUT WHO ARE YOU
TO SAY IT ISN'T HEAVEN?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.839
A RATIONAL-MINDED PERSON,
THAT'S WHO.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.840
(lowered voice)
WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP?

19:00.873 --> 19:01.941
I FINALLY GOT BOYD
TO GO TO SLEEP,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.343
AND I'D LIKE TO
KEEP HIM THAT WAY.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.312
HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN QUANTIFY?

19:05.345 --> 19:06.679
(lowered voice)
BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FILLED

19:06.713 --> 19:08.615
WITH THINGS THAT DON'T
MAKE ANY RATIONAL SENSE.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.251
YEAH, A LOT OF THINGS,
LIKE THE U.N.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.288
PLUS-SIZED BIKINIS.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.590
WEALTHY DEMOCRATS.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.362
THE FACT THAT YOU TWO GOT
TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.031
KRIS, COME ON. TELL THEM
WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.333
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.900
I BELIEVE IN BOYD
SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT,

19:27.934 --> 19:29.068
AND IF HEAVEN HELPS HIM
DO THAT,

19:29.101 --> 19:31.804
THEN HEAVEN HELP ANYBODY
WHO TELLS HIM OTHERWISE.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.306
(Mike) THAT'S MY GIRL.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.342
YES, I AM YOUR GIRL, DAD,
BUT I AM ALSO BOYD'S MOM,

19:35.375 --> 19:38.645
SO NO MORE SCARING HIM WITH
THE HARSH REALITIES OF LIFE.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.747
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOU CAN TALK TO MY DAD

19:40.780 --> 19:41.914
ABOUT THREE THINGS, OKAY?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.183
CARS, SPORTS,
AND SPAGHETTI WESTERNS.

19:44.217 --> 19:48.221
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE SUBJECTS.

19:48.255 --> 19:52.925
GOOD. THEY'LL BE
SHORT CONVERSATIONS.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.427
OH.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.862
OH.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.063
I CAN'T SLEEP.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.931
I KNEW IT. ALL THIS YELLING
WOKE HIM UP.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.234
HEY. DID YOU DREAM
ABOUT THE WORMS AGAIN?

20:01.268 --> 20:03.670
NO, I'M HUNGRY.
I WANT A BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.638
UGH, BOYD, BOLOGNA
COMES FROM...

20:09.609 --> 20:12.245
YOU KNOW, BUDDY,
I'LL MAKE THAT FOR YA.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.181
WHERE DOES BOLOGNA COME FROM?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.215
UH...

20:20.987 --> 20:33.032
MAGIC MEAT PEOPLE.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.635
(gunfire on TV)

20:35.668 --> 20:39.439
"THE GOOD, THE BAD,
AND THE UGLY."

20:39.472 --> 20:41.408
THAT'S YOUNG CLINT EASTWOOD.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.075
IT'S A CLASSIC
SPAGHETTI WESTERN.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.244
WHY SPAGHETTI?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.380
THE DIRECTOR--
SERGIO LEONE.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.648
FAMOUS ITALIAN DIRECTOR.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.783
I'M SURE THEY TRIED
"LASAGNA WESTERNS,"

20:50.817 --> 20:53.620
IT JUST SOUNDED STUPID.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.655
WELL, I HOPE IT'S BETTER
THAN CLINT'S LAST MOVIE--

20:55.688 --> 20:58.525
"THE OLD, THE CHAIR,
AND THE CRAZY."

21:00.259 --> 21:03.095
HE SAID WHAT NEEDED
TO BE SAID, OKAY?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.230
I'LL GIVE YOU THIS--

21:04.263 --> 21:07.166
THE CHAIR WASN'T
HIS BEST CO-STAR.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.601
RATES JUST ABOVE TYNE DALY

21:08.635 --> 21:11.471
AND BELOW
THAT STUPID ORANGUTAN.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.573
YEAH, BUT AREN'T ALL
THESE MOVIES THE SAME?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.175
A TOUGH, STOIC, VENGEFUL HERO

21:16.208 --> 21:17.410
TAKES THE LAW
INTO HIS OWN HANDS

21:17.444 --> 21:19.479
AND SHOOTS ANYBODY
HE DOESN'T LIKE?

21:19.512 --> 21:22.615
WHAT'S THE APPEAL?

21:22.649 --> 21:26.453
(Western theme playing)

21:26.486 --> 21:30.423
