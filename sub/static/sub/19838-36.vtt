00:03.640 --> 00:08.900
<b>To become kings, the Chimera Ants 
have spread across the world,</b>

00:09.150 --> 00:12.280
<b>committing acts of utmost 
tyranny wherever they go.</b>

00:18.480 --> 00:21.040
<b>Fearing the damage will spread,</b>

00:21.040 --> 00:24.370
<b>the government asks the Hunter 
Association to exterminate them.</b>

00:24.860 --> 00:28.250
<b>Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move.</b>

01:31.680 --> 01:34.190
<b>Ah, is that all?</b>

03:18.960 --> 03:23.970
<b>Infiltration x And x Selection</b>

04:02.620 --> 04:04.940
<b>Sneaking in was easy.</b>

04:04.940 --> 04:08.710
<b>But the question is how to get 
close enough to the enemy.</b>

04:09.300 --> 04:13.390
<b>And we can't let just anyone see us, either.</b>

04:13.480 --> 04:19.900
<b>Informants</b>

04:15.540 --> 04:18.260
<b>This country has a powerful 
information regulation system that</b>

04:18.260 --> 04:19.900
<b>operates in secret using groups of informants.</b>

04:19.900 --> 04:21.170
<b>Informants?</b>

04:21.170 --> 04:24.910
<b>Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy, 
you receive a reward.</b>

04:25.200 --> 04:27.830
<b>If you find evidence of insurgency, 
you receive a reward.</b>

04:27.830 --> 04:30.170
<b>If you stop someone from fleeing the 
country, you receive a reward.</b>

04:30.560 --> 04:33.910
<b>So the people will do anything for that reward.</b>

04:34.500 --> 04:36.090
<b>And they aren't just after money.</b>

04:36.590 --> 04:40.710
<b>After racking up enough informant points, 
the entire group is promoted.</b>

04:41.140 --> 04:45.650
<b>But if someone provides false information 
or a member commits a crime,</b>

04:45.650 --> 04:48.140
<b>the entire group is punished.</b>

04:48.960 --> 04:50.480
<b>Carrot and stick, huh?</b>

04:51.100 --> 04:52.920
<b>It's pretty nasty business.</b>

04:53.700 --> 04:56.440
<b>Family members are put in different groups.</b>

04:56.940 --> 04:59.440
<b>So if an entire group tries to escape,</b>

04:59.440 --> 05:03.140
<b>the other family members can be 
executed or imprisoned for life.</b>

05:04.270 --> 05:09.830
<b>If a family is caught trying to escape together, 
they'll be executed, no questions asked.</b>

05:10.770 --> 05:14.170
<b>For this country's elite to live the good life,</b>

05:14.170 --> 05:16.330
<b>the rest of its citizens must scrape by.</b>

05:16.560 --> 05:21.530
<b>But the media also spreads lies. 
Such as that, in other countries,</b>

05:21.530 --> 05:24.600
<b>half the population starves by age ten.</b>

05:24.600 --> 05:27.550
<b>Foreign aid never reaches the needy.</b>

05:27.550 --> 05:30.600
<b>Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles.</b>

05:31.440 --> 05:35.220
<b>It's even said that East Gorteau spends 
grant money developing nuclear weapons</b>

05:35.220 --> 05:40.050
<b>that become bargaining chips in negotiations 
for unprecedented foreign aid increases.</b>

05:41.970 --> 05:44.360
<b>Hey, don't overheat!</b>

05:44.580 --> 05:47.250
<b>I th-think I'm okay...</b>

05:47.250 --> 05:49.510
<b>That was just so complicated...</b>

05:51.340 --> 05:53.980
<b>But you sure know a lot about it.</b>

05:53.980 --> 05:55.510
<b>My brother told me everything.</b>

05:55.910 --> 05:58.370
<b>And he probably heard it from Grandpa.</b>

05:58.580 --> 05:59.720
<b>Your grandpa?</b>

05:59.720 --> 06:04.760
<b>Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated 
the country for a job.</b>

06:05.600 --> 06:09.240
<b>And I've seen similar information 
on Hunter websites.</b>

06:09.240 --> 06:12.170
<b>The system is likely still in use.</b>

06:25.550 --> 06:26.500
<b>There's a village.</b>

06:26.500 --> 06:28.470
<b>Yeah... It's not very big.</b>

06:28.470 --> 06:29.300
<b>What do we do?</b>

06:29.760 --> 06:30.580
<b>Sneak in.</b>

06:31.010 --> 06:32.990
<b>Is that a good idea?</b>

06:33.570 --> 06:35.410
<b>We need current information.</b>

06:35.830 --> 06:40.920
<b>Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or 
how to identify someone's rank will help.</b>

06:41.470 --> 06:45.920
<b>They may have certain practices to root out spies.</b>

06:46.890 --> 06:49.130
<b>The more data we have, the better.</b>

06:50.020 --> 06:51.160
<b>Wait here.</b>

07:27.030 --> 07:28.860
<b>It's completely deserted...</b>

07:28.860 --> 07:31.970
<b>Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?</b>

07:32.440 --> 07:34.470
<b>No, something happened here.</b>

07:36.560 --> 07:37.970
<b>And someone's trying to hide it.</b>

07:37.970 --> 07:38.880
<b>Huh?</b>

07:41.750 --> 07:43.730
<b>They did a sloppy job.</b>

08:03.070 --> 08:06.510
<b>They didn't dig deep enough, 
so wild dogs got to the bodies.</b>

08:06.960 --> 08:09.760
<b>I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.</b>

08:10.110 --> 08:11.630
<b>What's going on?</b>

08:12.320 --> 08:14.890
<b>This is the true purpose of 
the national celebration.</b>

08:15.390 --> 08:20.770
<b>It's a pretense for entire populations of towns 
and cities to vanish without raising suspicion.</b>

08:22.350 --> 08:24.330
<b>The selection has already begun.</b>

08:26.570 --> 08:27.770
<b>In hindsight,</b>

08:28.090 --> 08:32.500
<b>it would be tough to summon all citizens to 
the capital and make the selection so quickly.</b>

08:32.920 --> 08:35.760
<b>This nation has a population 
of around five million.</b>

08:36.300 --> 08:39.970
<b>Clearing out one town or city 
at a time is more effective.</b>

08:40.590 --> 08:44.930
<b>In that case, their only concern would 
be coworkers or family members</b>

08:44.930 --> 08:47.330
<b>raising a fuss over the missing.</b>

08:48.770 --> 08:51.480
<b>But with the pretext of the national celebration,</b>

08:51.480 --> 08:55.270
<b>no one will find it strange that 
they can't contact someone.</b>

08:57.550 --> 08:59.750
<b>In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,</b>

08:59.750 --> 09:04.920
<b>so if they believe the other party is traveling, 
it makes sense that they can't contact them.</b>

09:05.680 --> 09:08.020
<b>The selection will go very smoothly.</b>

09:09.890 --> 09:13.090
<b>The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner.</b>

09:13.620 --> 09:16.820
<b>They only need to attack the farthest
towns first and work their way east.</b>

09:17.660 --> 09:23.580
<b>If each town is told that the government 
will assign its people a time to depart,</b>

09:23.870 --> 09:28.030
<b>there won't be any problems regarding 
communication between towns.</b>

09:28.470 --> 09:33.210
<b>So, by preventing people from meeting 
between towns to travel together,</b>

09:33.210 --> 09:35.490
<b>they eliminate any cause for commotion.</b>

09:36.490 --> 09:37.470
<b>But...</b>

09:37.470 --> 09:38.240
<b>Hmm?</b>

09:38.240 --> 09:39.500
<b>That means</b>

09:39.500 --> 09:43.370
<b>they have to run around the nation 
to attack all five million citizens.</b>

09:43.370 --> 09:44.100
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:44.730 --> 09:49.610
<b>If one percent survives, that gives 
them fifty thousand soldiers.</b>

09:49.940 --> 09:52.580
<b>No, I mean before that.</b>

09:53.100 --> 09:56.870
<b>There are ten... No, nine days left.</b>

09:56.870 --> 10:00.100
<b>If you wanted to check five 
million people in that time,</b>

10:00.100 --> 10:03.120
<b>you'd need a lot of help.</b>

10:03.450 --> 10:05.960
<b>Assuming that one <i>Nen</i> user</b>

10:05.960 --> 10:09.510
<b>can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...</b>

10:13.520 --> 10:14.630
<b>Five hundred <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

10:14.880 --> 10:16.130
<b>Exactly!</b>

10:16.670 --> 10:20.980
<b>You're getting at the fact that there can't 
be that many Ants who can use <i>Nen</i>?</b>

10:20.980 --> 10:21.760
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:22.340 --> 10:25.300
<b>I agree, but it probably isn't that hard.</b>

10:25.860 --> 10:29.100
<b>They don't need <i>Nen</i> users to check everyone.</b>

10:29.100 --> 10:30.770
<b>Huh? Why not?</b>

10:31.620 --> 10:32.770
<b>They can use manipulation.</b>

10:47.770 --> 10:50.040
<b>The power that Chimera Ant used...</b>

10:50.890 --> 10:52.990
<b>I'm guessing it can be used 
to automate victims or,</b>

10:52.990 --> 10:56.750
<b>like Genthru's power, can probably be 
used to control multiple people at once.</b>

10:59.030 --> 11:01.520
<b>Ordinary humans have aura as well,</b>

11:01.520 --> 11:05.800
<b>so the manipulator could force a 
victim's aura to concentrate in his fist.</b>

11:05.800 --> 11:10.710
<b>One punch alone could create 
an army of fifty thousand.</b>

11:11.280 --> 11:14.370
<b>While leaving four million, nine hundred 
and fifty thousand dead in the process.</b>

11:20.630 --> 11:23.420
<b>Well, it isn't all bad news.</b>

11:23.830 --> 11:25.330
<b>If my theory is correct,</b>

11:25.800 --> 11:30.330
<b>causing a commotion to stop their 
selection will be simple.</b>

11:31.450 --> 11:33.480
<b>We merely have to pop up,</b>

11:33.480 --> 11:37.100
<b>take out whoever is being controlled, 
and cause a panic.</b>

11:39.280 --> 11:41.160
<b>Then we just encourage</b>

11:41.160 --> 11:44.550
<b>the people who escape to 
check on other towns nearby.</b>

11:45.310 --> 11:49.350
<b>If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled 
puppets, rather than actual <i>Nen</i> users,</b>

11:49.350 --> 11:51.290
<b>taking them down will be a cinch.</b>

11:51.290 --> 11:54.390
<b>We'll just run around, taking them down 
one after another, and wreak havoc.</b>

11:54.950 --> 11:55.740
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:56.480 --> 11:59.220
<b>The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.</b>

12:01.400 --> 12:03.380
<b>Once we make our move, 
they'll know we're here.</b>

12:04.540 --> 12:09.230
<b>If we want to go with the old man's 
plan, we should stay hidden.</b>

12:14.510 --> 12:15.500
<b>What do you think?</b>

12:23.960 --> 12:25.390
<b>Let's do it.</b>

12:25.760 --> 12:28.250
<b>If the selection has already begun,</b>

12:28.250 --> 12:30.640
<b>we can't just stand around watching.</b>

12:33.670 --> 12:35.650
<b>Okay, let's do it.</b>

12:35.650 --> 12:36.660
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

12:36.660 --> 12:38.670
<b>But I'll do this alone.</b>

12:38.670 --> 12:39.510
<b>Huh?</b>

12:39.510 --> 12:40.950
<b>You stay in hiding.</b>

12:40.950 --> 12:41.930
<b>Why?</b>

12:41.930 --> 12:43.280
<b>It'll go better if we both—</b>

12:43.410 --> 12:45.530
<b>Don't forget our main mission!</b>

12:46.620 --> 12:48.280
<b>Defeating that Chimera Ant.</b>

12:49.640 --> 12:51.220
<b>That should be your focus.</b>

12:53.780 --> 12:55.920
<b>Let me handle everything else.</b>

12:55.920 --> 12:57.470
<b>I'll stir things up.</b>

12:58.480 --> 13:02.960
<b>And no offense, but I work more easily alone.</b>

13:02.960 --> 13:04.800
<b>Jeez... Fine, I got it.</b>

13:06.690 --> 13:07.640
<b>Really?</b>

13:08.290 --> 13:09.030
<b>Huh?</b>

13:11.370 --> 13:13.060
<b>Do you really understand?</b>

13:13.860 --> 13:14.790
<b>Killua?</b>

13:17.510 --> 13:19.940
<b>Promise me you won't make a move!</b>

13:20.420 --> 13:23.220
<b>Not even if people are killed 
right before your eyes!</b>

13:24.770 --> 13:25.950
<b>Promise!</b>

13:43.530 --> 13:45.220
<b>I'll contact you by text.</b>

13:45.830 --> 13:48.470
<b>Our cell phones should still work in this area.</b>

13:49.240 --> 13:50.350
<b>Killua?</b>

13:51.400 --> 13:54.360
<b>Sorry... It's nothing!</b>

13:54.360 --> 13:56.190
<b>I'm just a little tense.</b>

14:05.340 --> 14:06.860
<b><i>What's this?</i></b>

14:07.680 --> 14:10.870
<b><i>They aren't citizens of this country.</i></b>

14:11.670 --> 14:14.520
<b><i>I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.</i></b>

14:14.520 --> 14:17.280
<b><i>But they're definitely strong...</i></b>

14:17.280 --> 14:18.870
<b><i>Are they assassins?</i></b>

14:20.290 --> 14:22.880
<b><i>Are they here to hunt down the King?</i></b>

14:23.760 --> 14:26.730
<b><i>Then I can't ignore them...</i></b>

14:26.730 --> 14:29.890
<b><i>But I don't want to fight them both at once.</i></b>

14:29.890 --> 14:33.430
<b><i>I definitely don't want to fight the 
silver-haired one on the left.</i></b>

14:33.860 --> 14:36.350
<b><i>Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong.</i></b>

14:36.350 --> 14:39.030
<b><i>As much potential as a Squadron Leader?</i></b>

14:43.780 --> 14:45.900
<b><i>That kid is something special.</i></b>

14:46.840 --> 14:50.780
<b><i>I completely concealed my presence, 
but he still sensed something?</i></b>

15:04.790 --> 15:06.810
<b>How convenient!</b>

15:19.970 --> 15:22.560
<b>Are you sure about this?</b>

15:23.190 --> 15:27.570
<b>You'll really transport my family 
and me to another country?</b>

15:28.020 --> 15:29.960
<b>Do not worry.</b>

15:29.960 --> 15:35.330
<b>We have received official approval, 
and prepared the necessary documents.</b>

15:35.640 --> 15:39.330
<b>All that's left is for you to sign the papers.</b>

15:39.900 --> 15:44.820
<b>However, the condition that you share 
your complete knowledge of military affairs</b>

15:44.820 --> 15:46.980
<b>in exchange for your freedom is essential.</b>

15:46.980 --> 15:49.350
<b>As mentioned in the agreement,</b>

15:49.350 --> 15:52.590
<b>if you do not keep up your end after signing,</b>

15:53.060 --> 15:56.600
<b>we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions.</b>

15:56.600 --> 15:58.630
<b>That won't be a problem.</b>

15:59.260 --> 16:00.750
<b>I'll tell you everything...</b>

16:03.980 --> 16:09.880
<b>All I know about the atrocities 
that Diego has committed.</b>

16:10.700 --> 16:12.230
<b>We appreciate it.</b>

16:12.230 --> 16:15.370
<b>Our lives are on the line, as well.</b>

16:17.320 --> 16:18.810
<b><i>"That Diego has committed"?</i></b>

16:19.220 --> 16:21.370
<b><i>You talk like it doesn't concern you.</i></b>

16:21.940 --> 16:25.140
<b><i>The wine you're drinking and 
the room you stand in</i></b>

16:25.640 --> 16:28.450
<b><i>were earned by following that bastard.</i></b>

16:30.290 --> 16:33.310
<b><i>You mean "that we've committed," 
you son of a bitch.</i></b>

16:37.630 --> 16:40.590
<b><i>But I get it... We're here on business.</i></b>

16:41.770 --> 16:43.390
<b>So, Marcos-san...</b>

16:44.180 --> 16:46.980
<b>Continue going about your business as normal.</b>

16:48.040 --> 16:52.390
<b>In two weeks, you and your family 
will be relaxing on the beach.</b>

16:54.810 --> 16:56.530
<b>I can't accept it!</b>

17:00.450 --> 17:04.870
<b>We're supposed to stand around, 
watching as people are killed?</b>

17:04.870 --> 17:06.190
<b>Are you sleepy?</b>

17:06.190 --> 17:08.220
<b>Want me to put you to sleep, eh?</b>

17:08.770 --> 17:11.050
<b>Calm yourself.</b>

17:11.780 --> 17:14.990
<b>If they're gonna check five 
million citizens in ten days,</b>

17:14.990 --> 17:17.300
<b>simple arithmetic says that's 
five hundred thousand per day!</b>

17:17.300 --> 17:20.140
<b>Of which one percent will survive!</b>

17:20.140 --> 17:21.060
<b>And your point is?</b>

17:21.490 --> 17:25.580
<b>That means four hundred, ninety-five 
thousand have already been killed!</b>

17:25.580 --> 17:27.690
<b>How can you be so calm?</b>

17:27.690 --> 17:32.570
<b>Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!</b>

17:36.230 --> 17:39.210
<b>If the plan fails, everyone dies.</b>

17:39.210 --> 17:42.210
<b>If we can't draw the three Royal 
Guards away from the King,</b>

17:42.210 --> 17:44.830
<b>not even the Chairman will 
be able to defeat the King.</b>

17:45.400 --> 17:51.340
<b>Thus, we cannot let them discover 
our existence before the time is right.</b>

17:51.770 --> 17:56.490
<b>If that happens, security around the 
King will be even further tightened.</b>

17:58.040 --> 17:59.350
<b>You must endure this.</b>

18:02.320 --> 18:06.100
<b>You're telling me to sacrifice five 
million to save the human race?</b>

18:06.610 --> 18:07.850
<b>That's right.</b>

18:09.880 --> 18:12.780
<b>If blaming me consoles you, go ahead.</b>

18:13.520 --> 18:18.570
<b>But if you don't have a better idea, 
don't be too self-righteous.</b>

18:20.690 --> 18:21.990
<b>Damn it...</b>

18:23.980 --> 18:26.500
<b>We must do only what we can.</b>

18:26.770 --> 18:31.500
<b>But we must put our lives on the line to do so.</b>

18:34.200 --> 18:35.190
<b>Yeah...</b>

18:48.130 --> 18:49.810
<b><i>Is Killua okay?</i></b>

18:50.350 --> 18:52.100
<b><i>He was acting a little weird.</i></b>

18:52.860 --> 18:55.880
<b><i>Maybe I should have stuck with him?</i></b>

18:56.360 --> 18:59.820
<b><i>But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad.</i></b>

19:24.980 --> 19:26.600
<b>You did well to avoid that.</b>

19:26.950 --> 19:28.660
<b>How about this?</b>

19:49.180 --> 19:53.850
<b>I use my strong tail as a spring, 
to propel me among the trees!</b>

19:54.420 --> 19:57.550
<b>In the darkness, following my 
movement is impossible!</b>

20:02.890 --> 20:04.760
<b>Caught you!</b>

20:05.220 --> 20:08.670
<b>Now I'm going to crush you!</b>

20:12.970 --> 20:14.670
<b>You're not crushing me!</b>

20:15.360 --> 20:15.860
<b>Huh?</b>

20:17.690 --> 20:21.330
<b>I'm the one who caught <i>you</i>!</b>

20:30.110 --> 20:32.670
<b><i>He seems to have a snake's genes,</i></b>

20:32.670 --> 20:37.120
<b><i>so he should be able to go ten 
days without starving to death.</i></b>

20:40.210 --> 20:43.090
<b>As I thought... He's strong...</b>

20:43.900 --> 20:47.050
<b>But I should continue to observe.</b>

20:50.080 --> 20:52.080
<b><i>I already let them find me...</i></b>

20:52.570 --> 20:54.140
<b><i>I need to hide better.</i></b>

20:55.600 --> 20:57.240
<b><i>But it's strange...</i></b>

20:57.240 --> 21:00.990
<b><i>Why are there soldiers around if the 
selection is already finished here?</i></b>

21:01.890 --> 21:05.540
<b><i>Maybe there are extra guards 
because we're near the border.</i></b>

21:21.170 --> 21:23.150
<b><i>An owl and a bat?</i></b>

21:37.300 --> 21:39.580
<b><i>This time, he's facing two...</i></b>

21:41.370 --> 21:42.940
<b><i>What will he do?</i></b>

21:48.490 --> 21:52.450
<b>The Chimera Ants are using 
darkness to attack Gon.</b>

21:53.580 --> 21:57.860
<b>And why is Meleoron following him?</b>

23:24.630 --> 23:27.340
<b>Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.</b>

23:27.340 --> 23:28.860
<b>Come on down, everyone...</b>

23:28.860 --> 23:30.840
<b>I have a perfectly ordinary box, 
which has not been touched.</b>

23:30.840 --> 23:32.090
<b>One, two, three!</b>

23:32.090 --> 23:34.220
<b>That would be an illusion.</b>
