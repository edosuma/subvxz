00:00.166 --> 00:03.567
Tell me about this incident that was nasty

00:03.633 --> 00:05.467
involving your daughter.

00:05.533 --> 00:08.500
I'm driving.
We start arguing because of his drug use.

00:08.567 --> 00:11.300
He reaches over, grabs the steering wheel,

00:11.367 --> 00:13.133
and pushes us onto oncoming traffic.

00:14.266 --> 00:15.633
While your daughter is in the car.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.834
-Yes.
-No!

00:16.900 --> 00:20.000
Listen to me, I don't want you to speak
to me again unless I'm looking at you.

All rise.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.400
Be seated please.

00:52.266 --> 00:56.200
Hello, Judge. You have case number 1037,
Liebel vs. Lara.

00:56.266 --> 00:57.200
Thanks, Kevin.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.967
Miss Liebel, this was your boyfriend
for a period of time

01:01.033 --> 01:03.033
-and you have a child together.
-Correct.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.266
When did you and the defendant
start to live together?

01:05.333 --> 01:06.433
2017.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.000
-What month?
-July?

01:08.767 --> 01:11.367
Actually it wasn't 2017,
it was 2018.

01:11.433 --> 01:13.834
Early 2018 when
I moved to Visalia from Fresno.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.367
It was after my birthday.

01:15.433 --> 01:17.300
-She got back in contact with me.
-[Judy] Just a second.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.100
-Just a second. I don't need a tome.
-[Marco] I'm not--

01:20.166 --> 01:21.900
-I need a date.
-[Marco] Okay.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.033
-And I need it slowly because I--
-[Marco] It was early July...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.867
I need it slowly 'cause I'm old.

01:25.934 --> 01:29.467
It was May-- It was 2017,
right after May,

01:29.533 --> 01:31.233
but when we actually
started living together

01:31.300 --> 01:33.066
was closer to 2018.

01:33.133 --> 01:34.767
So it had to have been maybe December,

01:34.834 --> 01:37.600
so when I moved to Visalia
for her from Fresno.

01:37.667 --> 01:39.200
You have a son or a daughter?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.066
-A daughter.
-How old is she?

01:41.133 --> 01:43.467
She's gonna be three in August.

01:43.533 --> 01:45.867
-And Mr. Lara's the father of that child.
-Correct.

01:45.934 --> 01:47.667
-And that's your only child?
-Yes.

01:47.734 --> 01:50.133
This has to do with an old car.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.066
You and Mr. Lara were living together,

01:53.133 --> 01:56.066
and then there came a time when there
started to be some friction.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.166
When did that start?

01:58.233 --> 02:01.066
It started August 2020.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.967
-It started sooner than that, Your Honor.
-Listen to me,

02:03.033 --> 02:05.133
I don't want you to speak to me again
unless I'm looking at you.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.333
Yes, ma'am.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.266
About what?

02:07.333 --> 02:09.266
He had been partying heavily.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.800
There had been some drug use.

02:10.867 --> 02:14.967
And I had been trying to help him get
visitation of his eldest daughter.

02:15.033 --> 02:17.100
Was he-- just a second--
was he working?

02:17.166 --> 02:19.333
-Yes.
-What kind of work was he doing?

02:19.400 --> 02:23.934
Temp agency. Uh, he was working
for Mid Valley Disposal,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.934
-like, dumpster...
-Temp work.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.734
-Yeah.
-Is that right, sir?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.033
-No.
-In August of 2020?

02:29.100 --> 02:31.233
-It was through a temp agency--
-Were you-- Shh!

02:32.000 --> 02:35.567
In August of 2020,
who were you working for?

02:35.633 --> 02:38.133
August 2020, I was working for
American Carrier Equipment

02:38.200 --> 02:39.433
as a welder fabricator,

02:39.500 --> 02:41.533
as I'm currently doing right now,
over a year.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.667
I've been welding for five years.

02:43.734 --> 02:47.967
Okay. And during that time,
there was some difficulty

02:48.033 --> 02:50.600
-but you purchased a new car.
-Yes.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.166
When did you purchase a new car?

02:52.233 --> 02:53.233
January 2020.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.000
And you kept your old car,
which was what kind of a car?

02:57.066 --> 02:58.900
Chevy Impala 2007.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.367
-And that car is titled in your name.
-Correct.

03:01.433 --> 03:05.133
You got a new car because
I assume you wanted a more reliable car.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.233
The Impala was reliable.

03:07.300 --> 03:11.100
Uh, I started going to school
so I needed my own car to

03:11.166 --> 03:14.633
take my daughter to her appointments,
for me to go to school,

03:14.700 --> 03:16.066
-he needed it--
-And as a family,

03:16.133 --> 03:18.300
-And as a family,
because you were living as a family,

03:18.367 --> 03:19.834
-right?
-Correct, yeah.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.600
So I didn't always have the car
when I needed it.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.567
Just a second. So...
you needed a second car.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.967
And the family car had been the Impala.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.400
So far, correct?

03:28.467 --> 03:29.633
Mm-hmm.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.533
-"Uh-huh" is not an answer.
-[Marco] Yes, ma'am.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.467
That would be "yes."
And you can leave out the "ma'am."

03:33.533 --> 03:34.800
That could be-- yes is fine.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.800
When you got the new car,

03:36.867 --> 03:41.667
and he was driving primarily
the 2007 Chevy Impala,

03:41.734 --> 03:44.600
was there any financial arrangement
that the two of you made

03:44.667 --> 03:46.900
while you were still living
and sleeping together?

03:46.967 --> 03:48.934
-Hm. Mm-mm.
-No.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.700
-[Judy] He just drove it?
-He drove it, yeah.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.066
[Judy] Okay. He just drove it.

03:52.133 --> 03:56.467
And then there came a time that
you had a bad argument, kerfuffle,

03:56.533 --> 03:59.133
-while you were driving someplace.
-Very correct.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.800
Tell me when that happened.

04:00.867 --> 04:05.000
That happened August 24th, 2020,
two days before my daughter's birthday.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.333
-Tell me about it.
-[Lauren] So...

04:06.400 --> 04:08.900
we had already broken up
for a couple weeks. I was--

04:08.967 --> 04:11.200
When you say you had broken up
for a couple of weeks,

04:11.266 --> 04:12.734
he was still living in the house?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.600
-Yes, we were still living together.
-[Judy] So that means...

04:14.667 --> 04:17.333
So that means somebody
was sleeping on a sofa.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.233
Yes. Essentially.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.934
What do you mean "essentially"?
What does that mean?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.567
So I would leave and spend the weekends
in Visalia.

04:23.633 --> 04:25.500
And he would work in the week,

04:25.567 --> 04:27.934
I was working from home at the time
due to COVID.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.834
So he would watch Daenerys, my daughter,
while I was...

04:31.900 --> 04:34.667
you know, in the office,
back office area,

04:34.734 --> 04:35.967
being a receptionist.

04:36.033 --> 04:40.934
Would it be a fair statement that
the two of you had decided to break up

04:41.000 --> 04:44.734
prior to this incident that occurred
in August of 2020?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.367
-Honestly, Your Honor, no.
-[Judy stammers]

04:46.433 --> 04:47.967
-So you don't know.
-It's not a fair statement to say that.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.166
-No.
-[Judy] What?

04:49.233 --> 04:51.033
-It's not a fair statement to say that.
-[Judy] Okay.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.867
So you had been together.

04:52.934 --> 04:55.033
It was a single decision on her behalf.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.500
Okay. Well...

04:56.567 --> 04:58.800
She decided to break up with you.

04:58.867 --> 05:01.266
-And the apartment I paid rent for.
-[Judy] Prior...

05:01.333 --> 05:02.967
-[Marco] On my lease.
-I don't care.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.934
All I hear,
asking her all these questions.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.066
-[Judy] Mr. Lara--
-[chuckles] Okay. Sorry, Your Honor.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.433
What I'm asking you is,
would it be a fair statement

05:11.500 --> 05:14.533
that you were broken up
as a family?

05:14.600 --> 05:17.200
You maybe had been residing
in the same place,

05:17.266 --> 05:22.133
two weeks prior to this incident
that was nasty

05:22.200 --> 05:23.433
involving your daughter.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.000
-Yes.
-[Judy chuckles] Perfect.

05:25.066 --> 05:26.633
Now, tell me about this incident

05:26.700 --> 05:29.300
that happened right before
your daughter's birthday.

05:29.367 --> 05:33.333
Okay, so it was--
we were going to Picture People,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.800
to take my daughter, uh, two year old,
you know, pictures--

05:36.867 --> 05:38.233
I wanted to hand it out to the family.

05:38.300 --> 05:43.166
And... so we are in the picture studio

05:43.233 --> 05:45.567
and my daughter has my phone,
she's using YouTube.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.200
And he decides to grab the phone
from my daughter,

05:48.266 --> 05:51.033
go through my messages and see that
I'm messaging other guys.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.233
And so we're arguing because of that.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.467
And so now we're...
That's over with.

05:56.533 --> 05:57.900
We're in the car, we have the pictures.

05:57.967 --> 05:59.867
We're driving, we're almost home.

05:59.934 --> 06:02.967
And you know how arguments
don't necessarily stay with

06:03.033 --> 06:05.734
one thing, it gets into
the more deeper issues.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.333
So it got into...

06:07.400 --> 06:09.166
And this is all while
your daughter is the car.

06:09.233 --> 06:12.467
Yes. She's asleep.
She's in the car, he's in the car.

06:12.533 --> 06:15.700
I'm driving.
Because I'm the only licensed driver.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.133
He's in the passenger seat.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.300
We start arguing because of his drug use
the weekend before

06:21.367 --> 06:23.100
when he was staying at his friend's house.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.934
And I was just so upset
because I had filled out...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.533
-You were upset.
-Yes.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.100
Tell me what happened after you got upset.
You're driving...

06:33.166 --> 06:37.900
I let him know, like, I am gonna tell his
other-- mother of his other child

06:37.967 --> 06:39.867
that he's using drugs
and basically--

06:39.934 --> 06:43.567
Ooh. Now that's, you know,
that's a "gut thing."

06:43.633 --> 06:44.700
Yeah. Yeah.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.767
I'm not driving both cars so I shouldn't
have to pay interest

06:46.834 --> 06:48.066
for both of her cars.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.834
-No, you shouldn't-- Shh!
-I shouldn't have to give her gas money

06:49.900 --> 06:51.233
when she's going to the store.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.000
I shouldn't have to be
raising a kid alone.

06:53.066 --> 06:55.367
But you-- if you answer him,
I'm dismissing your case,

06:55.433 --> 06:56.633
do you understand?

07:00.533 --> 07:02.367
[theme music]

07:06.667 --> 07:10.700
[narrator] <i>Lauren Liebel claims her</i>
<i>daughter's father, Marco Lara</i>

07:10.767 --> 07:13.867
<i>refuses to return a car that she owns.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:15.734
Okay. Tell me what happened

07:15.800 --> 07:18.033
after you got upset.
You're driving...

07:18.133 --> 07:22.934
I let him know, like, I am gonna tell his
other-- mother of his other child

07:23.000 --> 07:24.700
that he's using drugs and basically--

07:24.767 --> 07:29.000
Ooh. Now that's, you know,
that's a "gut thing."

07:29.066 --> 07:30.600
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Judy] That's a gut thing.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.533
I'm not proud of it, but I did it.
And so I told him that.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.166
He is-- starts getting really emotionally
upset and saying that

07:36.233 --> 07:39.500
I'm trying to take his kids from him,
which is not the case, obviously.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.000
He's in the car because Daenerys.

07:41.066 --> 07:43.033
Okay, so let me, uh...

07:44.567 --> 07:45.600
[exhales]

07:47.200 --> 07:48.500
Let me understand this.

07:48.567 --> 07:53.633
You were arguing with Mr. Lara
because a couple weeks before,

07:53.700 --> 07:59.467
in your judgment, he had resumed
use of unauthorized drugs.

07:59.533 --> 08:02.200
-Yes.
-And you had been involved

08:02.266 --> 08:07.500
with him in trying to get visitation
with another child or children?

08:07.567 --> 08:09.300
-Child, Your Honor.
-Child.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.200
-How old is that child?
-She's four. She's about to be five.

08:12.266 --> 08:14.967
And so what you threatened to do was

08:15.033 --> 08:17.266
you threatened to advise
the mother of that child

08:17.333 --> 08:20.633
who was involved in
a visitation dispute with him

08:20.700 --> 08:22.667
-that he was back on drugs.
-Mm-hmm.

08:22.734 --> 08:26.133
Okay. Well, that would be a smart thing
and protective of the four-year-old.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.066
-Yeah.
-[Judy] I mean, one would think that

08:28.133 --> 08:30.900
a court who was handling that
would be wise enough

08:30.967 --> 08:32.467
to order drug tests.

08:32.533 --> 08:36.467
But you weren't saying it for that reason.
You were angry.

08:36.533 --> 08:38.600
-Yeah, I was the one who was...
-[Judy] You were angry.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.200
-trying so hard to get...
-Mm-hmm.

08:40.266 --> 08:41.333
-[Judy] To get it all together.
-Yeah.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.433
And he was disappointing.
I got the picture.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.734
All right. So, there was an argument.
The police were called.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.100
Yes. So, I'm in the car.
I say that.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.066
He gets emotionally upset,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.700
reaches over, grabs the steering wheel

08:55.767 --> 08:57.734
and pushes us into oncoming traffic.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.934
[chuckles]

08:59.000 --> 09:01.900
We don't-- I get control,
nobody was injured.

09:01.967 --> 09:05.066
I'm still upset at this point.
because my daughter is right behind me.

09:05.133 --> 09:06.734
I got it. Who called the police?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.834
Uh, somebody across the street.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.100
Somebody who was observing this incident.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.700
I had to yell out because he,
at that point,

09:13.767 --> 09:15.500
had grabbed my cell phone
and my keys

09:15.567 --> 09:18.100
and wouldn't let me out of the car
and I was yelling for help.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.433
-And so somebody, a bystander--
-[Lauren] Yes.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
-Called the police.
-And that's evident in my police report.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.900
The police arrived.
May I see the police report please, Kevin?

09:24.967 --> 09:28.900
While we're doing this, Sarah,
just have at your fingertips

09:28.967 --> 09:31.000
a 2007 Chevy...

09:31.066 --> 09:33.700
I need the model and approximate mileage.

09:33.767 --> 09:35.800
Any particular model Chevy Impala?

09:35.867 --> 09:38.000
Yeah. I have all the evidence right here.

09:38.066 --> 09:40.767
Okay. Kevin, would you hand that?

09:40.834 --> 09:42.667
-The kind of--
-[Marco] And I have pictures...

09:42.734 --> 09:45.967
No, I just wanna know the make
and the model is what I'm asking you.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.467
-[Kevin] Make and model?
-[Lauren] Yeah, Chevy Impala.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.800
-[Judy] Shh! Just hand it--
-Make and model... Chevy Impala.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.500
-Just hand it-- Make, model.
-[Marco] Chevy Impala 2008 LT.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.867
Just give me the document.
One, two, three.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.200
-I was trying to give it to him.
-[Judy] One, two, three.

09:57.266 --> 09:58.300
Thank you.

10:01.934 --> 10:06.767
Okay. So according to the police report,
which is clear,

10:06.834 --> 10:11.000
the person who called the police
heard screaming coming from a car.

10:11.066 --> 10:14.266
"Female screaming from a car."
She called the police.

10:14.333 --> 10:18.533
Neither party was to press charges
but the police officer suggested

10:18.600 --> 10:21.633
that one of them voluntarily
leave the home.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.533
"Police officer: I suggested that perhaps
someone leave for the evening

10:25.600 --> 10:28.934
so that each party could cool off
and have time to think things over."

10:29.000 --> 10:33.200
You agreed to leave for the night
to avoid further disturbance.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.934
-Mm-hmm.
-You said

10:35.000 --> 10:39.533
that he had a vehicle,
a Chevy Impala, he could leave in.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.467
I'm trying to think of who's one,
and who's two.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.867
Oh. IP One. Okay.
You agreed to leave for the night?

10:45.934 --> 10:47.834
He agreed to leave for the night.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.000
I told the police officers
that that's my car.

10:51.066 --> 10:53.000
-No, that's not what--
-And I didn't want him to take it.

10:53.066 --> 10:55.867
It said, P2 said, "He had--

10:55.934 --> 11:00.100
<i>"He </i>had a Chevy Impala he could leave in."

11:00.166 --> 11:03.800
You said the car was in her name
and she paid for the vehicle

11:03.867 --> 11:06.433
but could not provide proof
of these things.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.066
"I advised her that the matter
involving any vehicles

11:09.600 --> 11:11.533
would have to be
decided in civil court

11:11.600 --> 11:14.266
since it was a civil issue."

11:14.333 --> 11:18.333
<i>You </i>gathered all of your property,
clothing, personal items, etcetera,

11:18.400 --> 11:20.667
-and left the location.
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:20.734 --> 11:23.767
So the police escorted you home
and you took the car.

11:23.834 --> 11:26.333
-Mm-hmm. No argument...
-[Judy] That's a yes.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.333
-What?
-Yes.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.700
-[Judy] That's a yes.
-And I gave her the apartment, too.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.667
Who lives in that apartment?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.300
-[Judy] Just a second-- Hey!
-You moved out.

11:33.367 --> 11:34.734
-Hey, hey, hey!
-[Lauren chuckles] Sorry.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.934
I don't live there so I'm like,
what is he talking about?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.767
I gave her the apartment and then
she up and took my daughter to Visalia

11:39.834 --> 11:41.800
without telling me
two days later.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.400
Don't you understand they're
gonna cut off your mic?

11:43.467 --> 11:46.400
I'm not looking at you
and I didn't ask you a question.

11:46.467 --> 11:48.700
Yes, ma'am. Yes, Your Honor.

11:49.266 --> 11:53.000
Okay. So, at the time of this incident,

11:53.066 --> 11:54.934
-you said you would leave.
-Mm-hmm.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.800
You said that you had a car
that you could use.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.266
-She said it was in her name.
-Mm-hmm.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.867
The police said,
"Take that up in civil court."

12:02.934 --> 12:06.133
-Mm-hmm.
-You went home without her present,

12:06.200 --> 12:09.266
went in, gathered up your things,
and left in the Chevy Impala.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.100
You had been driving the new car,

12:11.166 --> 12:12.900
-I assume, to go to the picture taking
-[Lauren] Correct.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.667
for your daughter's second birthday.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.433
-Yeah.
-[Judy] Great. Okay.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.433
Now, she wants her car back,
or the value thereof.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.967
Ball is in your court.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.500
Okay. So...

12:22.567 --> 12:25.333
she is trying to go after me
for two thousand dollars,

12:25.400 --> 12:27.533
-which is what I was going to...
-[Judy] No, no, no.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.900
-bring. I have evidence of the car.
-No, I-- what you have to tell me, sir,

12:30.967 --> 12:35.400
-is she bought this car. The--
-We bought it together, yes.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.400
Well, actually, she got the loan
from her bank.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.700
And then I was helping paying off the loan

12:39.767 --> 12:42.166
Okay. But is the loan paid off?

12:42.233 --> 12:43.166
-Yes, completely.
-[Judy] Yes.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.367
I paid the loan off with
my tax return money.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.233
The last bit of the loan
she paid off, yes.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.166
Whatever. The car is in her name.

12:49.233 --> 12:52.900
So I want you to tell me you went home,
you took the car,

12:52.967 --> 12:54.700
-the car is in her name.
-With permission.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.734
Have you had previous discussions with her
about the car?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.700
-Yes. And I have messages on my phone.
-[Judy] When? When?

12:59.767 --> 13:04.433
And emails saying that as long as
I continue paying my daughter's tuition,

13:04.500 --> 13:08.033
which is $680 a month,
that I pay by myself,

13:08.100 --> 13:11.900
that I was going to be able to use the car
as transportation to go back and forth--

13:11.967 --> 13:14.000
-Yes, that I could go back and forth
-Great, I'd like-- Shh!

13:14.066 --> 13:15.834
-to my side of Fresno.
-[Judy] Just a second.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.266
-Just a second. I'd like to see it.
-[Marco] Okay.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.800
Mm-hmm.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.934
And that was her threatening me before
taking me to claims court.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.233
Just a second.

13:30.967 --> 13:33.300
-There are other previous--
-[Judy] Shh!

13:33.367 --> 13:35.734
This is June 9th of what year?
This year?

13:36.500 --> 13:37.433
This year?

13:38.467 --> 13:41.767
Well, then you answer her.
She says to you,

13:41.834 --> 13:43.867
"I want to get the car back to be fixed

13:43.934 --> 13:47.367
so I can sell it.
You've been using it for the last year.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.667
But I need it back so that I can sell it."

13:49.734 --> 13:53.400
And she says,
"Hopefully this issue could be resolved

13:53.467 --> 13:57.000
without all that mess,
especially considering you drove my car

13:57.066 --> 14:00.266
back and forth to work.
It's the least you can do

14:00.333 --> 14:06.233
in appreciation for driving a car free
you didn't make payments on."

14:06.300 --> 14:08.433
And you respond to her,

14:08.500 --> 14:11.200
"I'II get it fixed enough to sell

14:11.266 --> 14:14.133
but only if you keep giving me
Stink on Fridays--"

14:14.200 --> 14:16.333
-What is that?
-Stink is my nickname for our daughter.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.467
Because she refused to give me
my daughter on weekends.

14:18.533 --> 14:19.734
Just a second. Well.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.200
-[Marco] But that's something--
-Just a second.

14:21.266 --> 14:22.467
Is that what you call her?

14:22.533 --> 14:24.800
I don't call her that. I call her Peanut.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.266
Peanut's also my nickname
that I started for her as well.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.433
-[Judy] Well, I'm just gonna--
-It shouldn't matter what I call my kid.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.166
First, let's try to use the word "child"
or "my daughter"

14:34.233 --> 14:36.300
instead of referring to "kid."

14:36.367 --> 14:39.100
Either the kid you're gonna visit,
or "Stinky,"

14:39.166 --> 14:41.934
but I'm telling you, as she gets older,
she's three now,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.533
she's not gonna like that nickname.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.333
If he wants to act like a fool,
let him act like a fool!

14:48.400 --> 14:49.867
I'm not acting like a fool,
but you're allowing her to talk--

14:49.934 --> 14:51.533
I'm telling you,
you're acting like a fool!

14:51.600 --> 14:54.567
Don't tell me. I'm the person
who's supposed to judge this case

14:54.633 --> 14:56.800
and I'm telling you
you're acting like a fool!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.266
[theme music]

15:07.533 --> 15:11.667
[narrator] <i>Lauren Liebel has accused</i>
<i>former boyfriend Marco Lara</i>

15:11.734 --> 15:13.767
<i>of wrongfully keeping her car.</i>

15:13.834 --> 15:17.900
Okay. She says to you,
"I want to get the car back to be fixed

15:17.967 --> 15:21.166
so I can sell it." And you respond to her,

15:21.233 --> 15:26.900
"I'll get it fixed enough to sell but only
if you keep giving me Stink on Fridays."

15:26.967 --> 15:29.066
-What is that?
-Stink is my nickname for our daughter.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.033
Because she refused to give me
my daughter on weekends.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.600
Just a second. Okay.
So it's clear based upon these

15:34.667 --> 15:38.000
that you agreed with her
to give her the car

15:38.066 --> 15:39.467
-as long as--
-Time, yeah.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.934
As long as you have
visitation on Fridays.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.367
So you were sort of bartering it.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.100
That doesn't make any difference to me.

15:45.166 --> 15:50.734
What is clear is that you understood
that the car still belonged to her

15:50.800 --> 15:53.033
and that she was allowing you to drive it.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.300
That's from your email.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.500
Would you like me
to show you other emails?

15:55.567 --> 15:56.500
[Judy] What?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.166
Would you like me to show you
other emails of her...?

15:58.233 --> 16:01.266
So I don't know if, um...
the whole thing,

16:01.333 --> 16:03.133
the whole message,
was screenshotted,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.400
but I have pretty much the same thing,

16:05.767 --> 16:08.667
only I'm saying you've been claiming the
money that you've been sending me

16:08.734 --> 16:10.767
-for your daughter is for the Impala.
-I read that.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.600
-I read that. I read that.
-[Lauren] Okay.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.934
No, the car is yours.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.900
But you also see on the Cash Apps

16:15.967 --> 16:17.233
and she wants to say that
I haven't been helping her.

16:17.300 --> 16:20.967
There are receipts for insurance
for the Impala.

16:21.033 --> 16:23.133
-I have multiple receipts right here.
-[Judy] Well, you have-- Just a second.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.400
Thousands of dollars
that I've spent on that car,

16:25.467 --> 16:27.033
-Listen to me.
-not asking her for help.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.000
Listen to me.
You drove it. You drove it.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.066
-You drove it.
-He ran it into the ground.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.800
-[Judy] Just-- Shh!
-I'm the only one who fixed it.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.033
Don't. You drove it.

16:36.100 --> 16:39.967
If you drove it and had to fix it
for the year that you've had it,

16:40.033 --> 16:42.533
that's on you, you could've returned it
if you didn't want to--

16:42.600 --> 16:48.233
this message makes clear that there was
an agreement between the two of you

16:48.300 --> 16:51.133
that it wasn't your car,
that it was her car,

16:51.200 --> 16:52.567
she was letting you drive it.

16:52.633 --> 16:55.800
You were paying for insurance--
well, who's supposed to pay insurance?

16:55.867 --> 16:57.133
Her? You were driving it.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.367
You were driving it.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.700
I'm not driving both cars.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.834
So I shouldn't have to pay insurance
for both of her cars.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.166
[Judy]
No, you shouldn't-- Shh!

17:03.233 --> 17:05.300
I shouldn't have to give her gas money
when she's going to the store.

17:05.367 --> 17:08.000
-[Judy] Just a second.
-Like I have all of these Cash Apps--

17:08.066 --> 17:09.767
I shouldn't have to be
raising a kid alone.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.000
If you answer him,
I'm dismissing your case!

17:12.066 --> 17:13.133
Do you understand?

17:13.200 --> 17:16.100
If he wants to act like a fool,
let him act like a fool!

17:16.166 --> 17:17.667
I'm not acting like a fool,
but you're allowing her to talk.

17:17.734 --> 17:19.233
I'm telling you,
you're acting like a fool!

17:19.300 --> 17:21.367
-I realize that--
-Don't tell me. I'm sitting here.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.333
I'm the person
who's supposed to judge this case

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
and I'm telling you
you're acting like a fool!

17:25.467 --> 17:30.567
This email from you suggests
that you were using the car,

17:30.633 --> 17:31.900
understanding it was her car.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.600
You never asked her
for a title to the car,

17:34.667 --> 17:36.567
you were having conversations with her.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.400
That didn't happen.

17:38.467 --> 17:41.867
You paid for the insurance on the car
that you were driving.

17:41.934 --> 17:44.000
You paid to have it fixed.

17:44.066 --> 17:46.567
According to you, thousands of--
but you were driving it!

17:46.633 --> 17:48.233
And you said to her,

17:48.300 --> 17:52.400
"I understand as long as you let me have
Stink, I'll give you the car back.

17:52.467 --> 17:53.467
On Fridays."

17:53.533 --> 17:54.667
Yeah, my agreement was her

17:54.734 --> 17:56.433
-not withholding my child from me.
-That's what-- Just a second.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.200
That's what-- That's what this says.

17:59.266 --> 18:04.300
And you can--
If she is withholding visitation--

18:04.367 --> 18:07.867
with-- child from you,
I would suggest

18:07.934 --> 18:09.767
you go to family court.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.567
We are doing that.
That's what you're focusing on,

18:11.633 --> 18:13.900
-is the child part, like--
-Just a second. Just a second.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.533
Well, that's great!

18:15.600 --> 18:17.200
-We're here for the car. [chuckles]
-Just a second.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.433
That's great.
I know we're here for the car.

18:19.500 --> 18:24.033
That you realized,
back in June, was not your car.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.066
-I don't have ever--
-If you want me to show you other emails

18:26.133 --> 18:28.467
of her threatening me and her--
to me telling her,

18:28.533 --> 18:30.633
"I'll give you 600
if you give me the title

18:30.700 --> 18:32.066
so I can put the 2,000 in,

18:32.133 --> 18:35.000
Just a second. Just a second.
So what you offered her

18:35.066 --> 18:38.533
before you put in the money
was $600 for the car.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.633
-And up.
-Just-- that's a yes or a no?

18:41.700 --> 18:45.066
-Yes.
-Did he offer you $600 for the car?

18:45.133 --> 18:49.100
He said, "I'll give you $500
if you sign it over to my mom.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.433
Do you have a license?

18:50.500 --> 18:53.066
-[Marco] No.
-"No." [laughs] Sarah...

18:53.734 --> 18:55.400
Just for my own information,

18:55.467 --> 19:01.133
what is the value of a 2007 Impala
in lousy condition?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.133
[chuckles] $200.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.667
For a private party exchange, it would be
between $2,000 and $3,000.

19:07.734 --> 19:12.667
Okay. I'm going to create an order
that gives you back the car.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.433
You could take it to a sheriff
and have them execute on the order.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.767
Otherwise, if within five days
he doesn't return the car,

19:20.834 --> 19:23.667
then you can call the police
and report it stolen.

19:23.734 --> 19:28.433
Because he is driving around
without a license in a car.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.500
I don't know, if he gets in an accident,
your insurance company

19:32.567 --> 19:35.900
is going to disclaim
because he has no license.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.266
-Correct.
-And you're going to be responsible.

19:38.333 --> 19:42.333
So I would suggest that you
get this car back ASAP.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.600
-I never withheld it from her.
-ASAP!

19:44.667 --> 19:48.400
-I was gonna tow it to her.
-Otherwise, report it stolen!

19:48.467 --> 19:49.867
Dude, you guys think
I'm holding it from her?

19:49.934 --> 19:51.400
-[Judy] Otherwise, report--
-I've given her the car.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.500
She can take the car.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.667
-Great!
-[Marco] We've tried giving her the car.

19:54.734 --> 19:56.567
-Great!
-But, like, she won't take it.

19:56.633 --> 19:58.333
When did you get a tow truck
to tow it to me?

19:58.400 --> 19:59.834
Because you're afraid.
I'm not--

19:59.900 --> 20:01.333
[Judy] No, no, no,
you're talking to each other.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.300
-No. I have given her the car
-Kevin. Kevin. Right in between.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.100
Right in between
and tell him to shut up.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.467
-Well, that's fine, I don't--
-Listen, please.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.300
-[Judy] Great!
-I'm just letting you know, ma'am.

20:10.367 --> 20:11.266
Listen. Just listen.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.500
I've spent thousands of dollars fixing
that car since I've had it.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.200
Good, you were driving it.

20:15.266 --> 20:16.667
-That's not--
-You were driving it.

20:16.734 --> 20:18.500
Dude, she can have the car.
I don't care. I'll lose it.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.433
Great! Perfect. Thank you very much.
This case is over.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.066
-Thank you.
-Okay, but do I get my $2,000 for repairs

20:24.133 --> 20:25.367
-No.
-that he ran the car into?

20:25.433 --> 20:26.800
-Nope. You get the car.
-[Kevin] Court adjourned.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.600
I think it was fair. I get my car back.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.166
And that's really what I wanted.

20:32.233 --> 20:33.533
I haven't gotten it back yet.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.834
He's a liar.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.300
No, he ran it into the ground.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.800
He drove it knowing that
the brakes needed to be changed.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.633
Motor mount needed to be fixed.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.834
Um, I hope he just makes good decisions
regarding our daughter

20:43.900 --> 20:45.233
and that he stays out of my life.

20:46.266 --> 20:48.967
And Sarah, I think that
the social takeaway from that case,

20:49.033 --> 20:50.667
the legal part was easy--

20:50.734 --> 20:53.834
the legal part was title's in her name,
it was clear that

20:53.900 --> 20:55.500
he was just using the car,

20:55.567 --> 20:57.467
he was paying the insurance on the car

20:57.533 --> 21:00.300
but there was never a gift of this car
that either existed

21:00.367 --> 21:02.266
or that anybody can prove.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.633
But the social part of this case
is really to me more important.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.700
And something that I learned
and I'm gonna take away from it.

21:08.767 --> 21:13.333
Never fight with your partner
in a moving vehicle.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.667
That's a very, very, bad place
to pick a fight.

21:15.734 --> 21:16.767
Mm-hmm.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.633
Fight some place
where you both are landlocked.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.000
Anyway, I feel sorry for that
little two-year-old.

21:22.066 --> 21:24.500
Nobody sleeps through
that kind of experience.

21:24.567 --> 21:28.133
And that kind of experience can,
you know, can affect you.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.233
Gotta love your child
more than you hate each other.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.700
That's it. That's the answer.
