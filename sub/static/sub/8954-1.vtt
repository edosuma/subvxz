I demand its immediate return.

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:11.618
You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
We get 400, 500 cars here a day.

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:14.663
Monsieur Devereaux is
a very important guest of this country.

01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:18.500
He's working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.

01:28:18.584 --> 01:28:21.545
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:24.089
Unless you wish to see this episode
portrayed in his film...

01:28:24.173 --> 01:28:27.050
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.136
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.346
Will you please
extinguish your cigarettes?

01:28:49.073 --> 01:28:51.908
What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.918
4,795 pounds.

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:09.343
You sure?

01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:12.304
That's what it was... 4,795 pounds...

01:29:12.388 --> 01:29:14.514
when it came into the shop.

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:18.226
The owner's manual says 4,675.

01:29:19.645 --> 01:29:21.646
It's 120 pounds overweight.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:28.695
And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4,795.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.948
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:38.413
Listen, I ripped everything out of there
except the rocker panels.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.624
Come on, Irv!
What the hell is that?

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:03.105
Uh-huh.

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:05.190
Well, shit!

01:30:07.777 --> 01:30:09.736
Son of a bitch.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:11.822
All right.
[Chuckles]

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:17.786
[Arguing In French]

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:20.997
It isn't the only car we have here.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:25.001
Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.587
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.589
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux...

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.801
but we get a lot of cars here at night,
and sometimes it's hard to keep track...

01:30:32.885 --> 01:30:35.387
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside.

01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:38.765
They, uh, stole it right
off the street from you, huh?

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.767
Goddamn.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:42.936
You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.606
I was told these things happen
in New York, but one never expects it.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:49.818
Well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?

01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:52.904
- Yeah. Where's my car, please?
- It's right over here.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:55.282
Oh.

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:57.492
But you're lucky this time.

01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:01.163
It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:03.415
[Chattering]

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:12.382
[Indistinct Dialogue]

01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:24.394
Henri.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:30.775
Je vous attendais.

01:31:32.945 --> 01:31:34.946

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.046

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.337

- Bon voyage.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.339
Merci.

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.925
- I would give you a ride, but-
- [Engine Revving]

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:09.137
- [Inaudible Dialogue]
- Tom, take care.

01:36:14.852 --> 01:36:16.811
[Sal]
Take care, baby.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:20.732
[Sal]
Lou!

01:36:20.816 --> 01:36:23.943

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:26.070
[Laughing]

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:29.741
- Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight, huh?
- Okay, babe. Take care, huh?

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:52.472

- [Tires Screech]

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:55.225

- [Sirens Wailing]

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:22.752

- We made a good strike, huh?

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.007
[Tires Screeching]

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:30.176
What happened with Sal?
What's the matter with him?

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.637
They got the bridge blocked off!

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:36.808
[Shouting]

01:37:36.892 --> 01:37:40.478
[Sirens Approaching]

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:43.898
Let me in! Open the door.

01:37:43.983 --> 01:37:45.984
[Sirens Wailing Loudly]

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.583
This is the police!
You're surrounded!

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:05.253
Come out with your hands up!

01:38:05.337 --> 01:38:07.797
This is the police! You're surrounded!

01:38:09.008 --> 01:38:11.009

01:39:05.856 --> 01:39:07.565
Bring out the gas!

01:39:18.327 --> 01:39:20.119
Hold your fire!

01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:23.790
[Gunshots Continue]

01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:26.209
Stop!

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:29.253
- [Rifle Cocks]
- Stop!

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:34.300
We're coming out! Hold your fire!

[Cloudy]
Popeye?

01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:58.908
It's me! It's me!

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:11.462
Frog One is in that room.

01:40:56.008 --> 01:40:57.967
Drop it!

01:41:16.987 --> 01:41:18.905
Mulderig.

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:24.202
- You shot Mulderig.
- [Panting]

01:41:24.286 --> 01:41:27.538
