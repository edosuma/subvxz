00:12.931 --> 00:15.008
Command Performance USA,

00:15.108 --> 00:19.263
<i>coming to you this week and every week
until it's over, over there.</i>

00:19.363 --> 00:22.850
<i>Flash! This is the news
the allied world has been waiting for.</i>

00:22.950 --> 00:25.026
<i>The battle for Berlin has ended,</i>

00:25.151 --> 00:28.613
<i>and Germany's unconditional surrender
is expected within days.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:31.357
<i>After 12 years and three months,</i>

00:31.457 --> 00:35.286
<i>Hitler's self-proclaimed 1,000-year Reich
has ceased to exist,</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:38.823
<i>but what of those reports
of a secret Nazi superweapon</i>

00:38.923 --> 00:40.262
<i>aimed at Washington?</i>

00:40.362 --> 00:42.911
<i>Categorically false,
says the War Department,</i>

00:43.011 --> 00:44.504
<i>and we believe them,</i>

00:45.130 --> 00:47.958
<i>so to every one of our brave Gls
soon to be home...</i>

00:48.058 --> 00:50.001
Hey, Chuck, can that radio!

00:50.101 --> 00:53.297
Like we need to be thinking about home
at a time like this.

00:53.397 --> 00:55.015
Say sauerkraut.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.384
Your best scowl yet, Kowalsky.

00:57.484 --> 01:00.950
We're flying into a suicide mission,
and you're taking pictures.

01:01.050 --> 01:02.451
Take it easy, Kowalsky.

01:02.551 --> 01:05.559
So they got a superweapon.
We got one, too.

01:05.659 --> 01:08.395
You mean that poster boy
for the recruitment office?

01:08.495 --> 01:11.114
He's gonna die down there
just like the rest of us.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.868
Captain. Drop zone, sir.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.249
All right, let's do this.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.792
Let's go.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.484
Go! Go! Go!

02:11.466 --> 02:15.220
Where's your Super Soldier, Barnes?
We're getting blown to pieces!

02:19.057 --> 02:20.350
Here he comes!

02:39.577 --> 02:42.455
Okay, soldiers, let's take this dump!

02:58.638 --> 03:00.598
So that's their superweapon.

03:21.077 --> 03:25.427
Captain America,
our fortunes have crossed yet again.

03:25.527 --> 03:26.708
Kleiser.

03:41.306 --> 03:44.051
This war is over, and you have lost.

03:44.151 --> 03:45.518
Haven't you heard?

03:46.019 --> 03:47.395
Hitler's dead!

03:50.815 --> 03:55.320
Patriotic fool! Look around you.
This isn't about Hitler!

04:32.690 --> 04:33.733
Cap.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.237
<i>My dearest Gail,</i>

05:19.988 --> 05:23.337
<i>if you're reading this,
it means something has happened to me.</i>

05:23.437 --> 05:26.620
<i>My only regret is
that I couldn't see you one last time,</i>

05:27.412 --> 05:29.915
<i>but I know in my heart
that we will meet again</i>

05:30.540 --> 05:32.584
<i>in this life or the next.</i>

05:33.459 --> 05:35.086
<i>Love, Steve.</i>

07:13.351 --> 07:14.936
Still nothing, General.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.105
Professor Ross?
- Hold on.

07:17.688 --> 07:21.267
I'm realigning inertial navigation systems.
Here we go.

07:21.367 --> 07:24.625
Echolocation has
a new target motion analysis.

07:24.725 --> 07:25.730
A new one?

07:25.830 --> 07:29.505
General Fury, the North Atlantic
is a complex jumble of currents,

07:29.605 --> 07:33.842
all of which are manipulated daily by tides,
precipitation and the whims of God.

07:33.942 --> 07:35.949
Multiply that by 60-plus years

07:36.049 --> 07:38.347
and the estimated weight
of a drifting body, and...

07:38.447 --> 07:40.119
Glacial mass off the starboard bow!

07:40.219 --> 07:41.379
All stop.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.323
I... I think we found something.

07:56.423 --> 07:57.429
Where?

07:57.529 --> 08:00.064
One hundred and eighty-two meters
straight ahead,

08:00.857 --> 08:02.734
inside that glacier.

09:04.295 --> 09:07.089
Well, I'll be damned.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.123
Maintain an incremental two-degree thaw.

09:28.223 --> 09:30.988
I wanna minimize any undue trauma
to the cadaver.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.574
Again, nice work, Professor.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.569
I'll let you be the one to inform Dr. Banner.

09:36.669 --> 09:38.121
Thank you, General.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.097
Dr. Banner? Excuse me. Sir?

09:56.847 --> 10:00.476
You were telling us the reason
we've been assigned to the Program.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.897
Right, well, let's see. Yes, General Fury.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.329
It seems the old guy
is running out of patience,

10:07.429 --> 10:09.193
so he's beefing up my staff.

10:10.528 --> 10:12.897
The Super Soldier serum, the same one

10:12.997 --> 10:17.160
that elevated a frail enlisted man
to the peak of human physical perfection.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.675
The original file. Read it. Memorize it.

10:19.775 --> 10:23.040
It's useless,
thanks to the inept record keepers of 1940,

10:23.374 --> 10:26.640
and so the secrets to that serum
died with Captain America

10:26.740 --> 10:28.205
at the end of World War II.

10:28.305 --> 10:30.916
Then what data
are we basing our trials on?

10:31.016 --> 10:33.293
A 4,000-page hypothesis,

10:33.393 --> 10:35.983
part of the package
you'll be enjoying tonight.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.548
You'll note that we have
12 Super Soldier candidates

10:38.648 --> 10:40.967
for whom we're developing
12 different serums.

10:41.067 --> 10:42.885
It's unique for every person,

10:42.985 --> 10:45.200
and to keep
the chain of possession untainted,

10:45.300 --> 10:48.767
only I am authorized
to handle their blood samples.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.610
But, then, what will we be doing?

10:51.736 --> 10:55.377
For now, you'll be assisting Professor Ross
in completing the rebirth chamber.

10:55.477 --> 10:57.108
It's what administers the serum.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.506
The schematics are also in your packet.

10:59.606 --> 11:00.912
Any questions?

11:02.204 --> 11:05.082
Any questions not about the Hulk?

11:08.419 --> 11:09.754
We found him!

11:40.993 --> 11:42.320
How's the body? Any damage?

11:42.420 --> 11:43.654
None that I could see.

11:43.754 --> 11:46.916
I mean, he looks like
he could just get up off the table.

11:54.382 --> 11:57.427
They'd better be careful.
The tissue could be fragile.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.620
Easy, soldier.

12:25.371 --> 12:27.290
This is not what you think.

12:36.215 --> 12:37.717
Everyone stand down.

12:38.259 --> 12:39.761
Let him get outside.

13:15.171 --> 13:17.298
A lot has changed, son.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.050
Did... Did We Win?

13:20.509 --> 13:22.011
We did.

14:05.429 --> 14:09.091
<i>Mission control,
activation of Shield One is complete.</i>

14:09.191 --> 14:11.227
<i>Affirmative, Sat Team. Stand by.</i>

14:25.282 --> 14:26.817
All systems are green, General.

14:26.917 --> 14:30.384
Okay, let's run it through its paces
before we kick it into orbit.

14:30.484 --> 14:31.956
Yes, sir.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.564
Sir, looks like we might have a hit
in the Nevada desert.

14:44.664 --> 14:45.761
Already?

14:49.306 --> 14:53.060
It's confirmed. Vibranium hull.
Definitely a Chitauri ship.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.720
It's changing course.

14:54.820 --> 14:58.308
You can run, but you can't hide,
not anymore.

14:58.408 --> 15:02.570
Sir, vectors indicate
it's moving into orbit toward the satellite.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.783
Get those astronauts
back in the shuttle now!

15:20.754 --> 15:23.311
<i>Sat Team, return to the shuttle immediately.</i>

15:23.411 --> 15:25.585
Return to shuttle immediately.

15:25.685 --> 15:27.670
I repeat, pull your team in.

15:27.770 --> 15:29.471
That is a hostile craft.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.848
<i>Affirmative.</i>

15:31.348 --> 15:33.976
Patch the signal into the war room.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.369
We have a situation.

16:00.469 --> 16:01.516
<i>We are aware.</i>

16:01.616 --> 16:04.019
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
We're in an uncontrolled descent.</i>

16:04.119 --> 16:05.583
<i>We cannot break free.</i>

16:05.683 --> 16:07.467
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

16:21.690 --> 16:23.817
<i>We're burning up! We're burning...</i>

16:26.737 --> 16:30.783
<i>General Fury, how long
before you can deploy another satellite?</i>

16:31.200 --> 16:32.902
I won't sacrifice any more lives

16:33.002 --> 16:35.237
until we can guarantee
the success of this mission.

16:35.337 --> 16:36.843
<i>How long, General?</i>

16:36.943 --> 16:38.324
Within the week.

16:38.424 --> 16:41.410
<i>Then we will use that time
to put a defense initiative in place.</i>

16:41.510 --> 16:43.379
<i>Jumpstart Project Avenger.</i>

16:43.754 --> 16:46.382
With all due respect,
that would be a mistake.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.856
<i>My Super <i>Soldier Program...</i>
- Has yet to yield results.</i>

16:49.956 --> 16:53.172
<i>Begin recruitment efforts immediately.
You have our short list.</i>

16:53.272 --> 16:56.362
But they're civilians,
superpowered showboaters.

16:56.462 --> 16:59.428
They won't take orders from me
or anyone else.

16:59.528 --> 17:01.076
The stakes are too high.

17:01.176 --> 17:04.537
<i>General Fury...</i>
- I just need a little more time.

17:04.637 --> 17:06.769
Now that we've found Captain America...

17:06.868 --> 17:08.694
<i>That is all, General.</i>

17:20.249 --> 17:22.452
They're just making sure he's stable.

17:22.551 --> 17:24.420
Still, I should be in there.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.214
What?
- I don't know.

17:28.757 --> 17:32.398
It's just nice seeing passion
in those eyes of yours again.

17:32.498 --> 17:36.444
Betty, finding Captain America
is an answer to so many problems.

17:36.544 --> 17:37.633
I know.

17:37.733 --> 17:40.073
I always knew you'd be the one
to crack the serum,

17:40.173 --> 17:41.742
and this is your chance.

17:41.842 --> 17:44.815
No, Betty, I mean our problems.

17:45.149 --> 17:47.789
Once I figure this out, we can...
- Bruce.

17:47.889 --> 17:50.688
Look, I know things have been bad.
I've screwed things up,

17:50.788 --> 17:53.628
but I'll get everything under control,
and we can be together again.

17:53.728 --> 17:56.827
Stop it! Just stop it! This isn't about us.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.593
This is about restoring your reputation
as a scientist.

18:00.693 --> 18:04.097
This time it will be different.
- No, Bruce, not again.

18:04.197 --> 18:05.336
Why?
- Why?

18:05.878 --> 18:07.797
Because it's never different.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.215
You'll never have it under control,

18:10.507 --> 18:13.301
and I can't live like that, not anymore.

18:17.306 --> 18:21.143
Banner, how soon before
there's a working trial on that serum?

18:21.769 --> 18:24.347
It's hard to say. Four weeks maybe.
- No good.

18:24.447 --> 18:26.349
The entire program is circling the drain.

18:26.449 --> 18:27.600
They can't do that!

18:27.700 --> 18:29.518
I need results, fast.

18:29.618 --> 18:30.853
Then take me off my meds.

18:30.953 --> 18:32.771
They're slowing me down.
- No!

18:32.871 --> 18:35.441
We all remember the last time
you tried that, Banner.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.659
They're still rebuilding the city.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.177
And what's going on
with the rebirth chamber?

18:43.277 --> 18:44.679
You're behind schedule.

18:44.779 --> 18:47.203
We're still waiting for components
from Stark Enterprises,

18:47.303 --> 18:48.746
and I can't get a hold of Tony.

18:48.846 --> 18:52.299
Don't worry about it.
I know how to get his attention.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.433
Sorry for the delay, Mr. Fortier.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.367
Yes, the contracts are now in the hands
of my GSA specialists.

19:05.467 --> 19:06.730
Next week at the latest.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.634
I'll have what he's having.

19:35.801 --> 19:38.512
Are you really Russian, or are you
just trying to make an impression?

19:40.514 --> 19:41.974
I try nothing.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.813
Let's start again. I'm Tony.

19:55.913 --> 19:58.573
Stark, I know.
I saw your name on the building.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.160
And you are?
- Unimpressed.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.030
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

20:04.130 --> 20:05.323
Would you like me to?

20:05.423 --> 20:09.001
Let's start with your name.
- Not here. In private.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.130
Is this private enough?

20:16.133 --> 20:17.301
Natalia

20:19.094 --> 20:20.429
Romanoff.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.306
As in the Black Widow?

20:23.599 --> 20:26.018
I prefer to call her my number one.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.638
You're a hard man to pin down, Tony.

20:29.738 --> 20:32.316
Not really, given the proper motivation.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.413
What's on your mind, Fury?

20:34.513 --> 20:35.978
Where are my parts?

20:36.078 --> 20:39.281
Try and be more specific.
I supply SHIELD with many parts.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.116
You do, don't you?

20:42.117 --> 20:43.694
Could be you're overextended.

20:43.794 --> 20:45.988
Too many fat military contracts?

20:46.088 --> 20:48.636
I could lighten your load, if you want.

20:48.736 --> 20:49.700
Nice, Fury.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.868
Bully the man who put SHIELD on the map.

20:51.968 --> 20:54.913
It was my impression
we put you on the map.

20:55.013 --> 20:57.249
Your parts were shipped out this afternoon.

20:57.349 --> 20:59.669
Now, we both know
you're not here busting my chops

20:59.769 --> 21:00.941
over tardy components.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.514
What do you really want?
- This guy.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.551
Iron Man? Why come to me?
- I think you know him.

21:07.651 --> 21:10.054
In fact,
I think he came to you for his armor.

21:10.154 --> 21:11.680
Please, I'm insulted.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.233
Stark Industries doesn't make cheap toys.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.122
Your helicopter is waiting.

21:16.222 --> 21:20.739
Jarvis, who am I having dinner with?
- The Governor, sir, in 15 minutes.

21:21.865 --> 21:25.786
I'm free for nightcaps later. Interested?
You can bring your gun.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.539
Maybe later.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.207
So long, Fury.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.081
This isn't a game, Stark.

21:37.181 --> 21:39.187
It's a matter of international security.

21:39.287 --> 21:40.625
I want your help on this.

21:40.725 --> 21:42.252
All right, if it's that important,

21:42.352 --> 21:45.089
I'll supply you
with my latest line of armaments,

21:45.189 --> 21:46.861
at a good price, of course.

21:46.961 --> 21:50.928
Jarvis, send Fury home
with a couple of my new plasma cannons.

21:51.028 --> 21:52.304
Certainly, sir.

21:52.404 --> 21:55.871
And let's avoid getting the Governor
into any mischief tonight,

21:55.971 --> 21:57.443
shall we, Mr. Stark?

21:57.651 --> 21:59.069
No promises.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.560
Sir, I'd like to speak
with the commanding officer.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.395
General Fury's away from the base.

22:21.495 --> 22:24.190
I'm Dr. Banner,
head of the Super Soldier Program.

22:24.290 --> 22:28.591
The Program still exists? But I...
I was told that it ended with me.

22:28.691 --> 22:31.343
It did, but not for lack of trying.

22:31.443 --> 22:33.646
It was reinstated several years ago.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.564
What, bad idea?

22:36.106 --> 22:37.349
I don't know.

22:37.449 --> 22:39.247
How many soldiers have gone through it?

22:39.347 --> 22:40.873
Counting you, one.

22:40.973 --> 22:44.523
I haven't been able
to duplicate the process, but I will.

22:44.623 --> 22:46.691
We're kind of hoping
you'll help us with that,

22:46.791 --> 22:50.036
which is why I'd like to take a blood sample
if that's okay.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.419
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.393
I just waited a long time for this.

23:00.493 --> 23:02.375
It means that much to you?

23:02.475 --> 23:04.468
It's everything to me.

23:06.636 --> 23:10.640
Here, this was in your jacket.
I wanted to make sure you got it back.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.969
Is she still alive?

23:14.069 --> 23:17.064
Yes, but there's something
you should know.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.797
And I want a full security detail
monitoring his every move.

23:29.897 --> 23:32.287
It's a different city than he remembers.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.832
Man, I hate ants.
- I know.

23:36.875 --> 23:37.972
Hello, Pym.

23:38.072 --> 23:39.828
Still holding a grudge, I see.

23:39.928 --> 23:43.374
No, I look at it this way.
You got what you deserved.

23:43.474 --> 23:45.980
Speaking of which,
have you cracked that serum yet?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.254
Good to see you've matured, Hank.

23:48.354 --> 23:49.776
Is your wife around?

23:49.876 --> 23:51.765
Is she expecting you?
- Yes, I am.

23:56.686 --> 23:59.160
And, honey,
they're ready for you in the lab.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.858
Don't forget your ants.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.939
I'll never understand
what you see in that guy.

24:07.039 --> 24:09.699
Yeah, unfortunately,
he doesn't see it, either,

24:09.991 --> 24:12.131
but, you know,
losing the SSP post to Bruce

24:12.231 --> 24:14.300
was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.302
He's achieved so much since then.

24:16.402 --> 24:18.346
No doubt to rub it in my face.

24:18.446 --> 24:19.472
Precisely.

24:19.572 --> 24:21.920
Good to know I can still inspire people.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.248
So what brings you to Brooklyn?

24:24.348 --> 24:27.376
We're forming a team, Janet.
I believe you'd be an asset.

24:27.476 --> 24:29.815
A team for what? Superhuman softball?

24:29.915 --> 24:32.214
We've got a problem
that's more than SHIELD can handle.

24:32.314 --> 24:34.883
Sorry, but I can't tell you
any more than that.

24:34.983 --> 24:37.686
I don't know, Nick.
This sounds too big for me,

24:38.228 --> 24:41.828
but I'll agree to help if you take Hank, too.

24:41.928 --> 24:46.332
No way.
I need heroes, not pretentious lab jockeys.

24:46.432 --> 24:49.698
Before you make up your mind,
I want to show you something.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.783
Yes?

24:55.370 --> 24:58.824
Listen, Jan, you don't need to beg Fury
to invite me to his little party.

24:58.924 --> 25:00.417
I can sell myself.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.546
Just show me what you got, Hank.

25:17.934 --> 25:21.688
Never underestimate
pretentious lab jockeys, Fury.

25:22.272 --> 25:26.748
General, an airliner has lost two engines
and is coming down over Long Island.

25:26.848 --> 25:31.031
Tragic, but why tell me?
- Iron Man is attempting to rescue it.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.953
Welcome to the team.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.299
Iron Man, was it a difficult rescue?

26:18.399 --> 26:21.657
<i>Please. Please, I'm only part
of a larger rescue effort.</i>

26:21.757 --> 26:23.667
<i>Be sure to...
- Target is stationary, sir,</i>

26:24.000 --> 26:25.806
<i>but he's surrounded by civilians.</i>

26:25.906 --> 26:27.329
<i>Hold all positions.</i>

26:27.429 --> 26:29.643
<i>Let's first attempt contact on the ground.</i>

26:29.743 --> 26:33.676
<i>Sorry, folks. That's all for today.
I'm late for a tune-up.</i>

26:34.803 --> 26:35.838
<i>He's made us.</i>

26:35.938 --> 26:37.305
Let's move!

26:43.186 --> 26:46.564
<i>Ease up, Iron Man.
I just wanna have a conversation.</i>

26:47.983 --> 26:49.693
Okay, here's your choice.

26:49.859 --> 26:52.779
<i>Either set down,
or we're gonna set you down.</i>

26:53.446 --> 26:55.198
<i>Right.
- Hi, there.</i>

27:04.874 --> 27:06.409
<i>What do you want with me?</i>

27:06.509 --> 27:08.620
A minute of your time. That's all.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.914
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

27:10.014 --> 27:12.312
The long and short of it,
the planet's being threatened,

27:12.412 --> 27:14.313
and we need a tough team to handle it.

27:14.413 --> 27:15.969
I want you on that team.

27:16.511 --> 27:18.221
<i>I work alone.</i>

27:19.848 --> 27:21.099
<i>And by the way,</i>

27:22.517 --> 27:24.811
<i>Stark sold you some lousy guns.</i>

27:28.523 --> 27:29.733
<i>Nice outfit.</i>

27:36.990 --> 27:39.493
Really, guys, I can find my way from here.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.320
Go get a cup of joe or something.

27:41.420 --> 27:44.164
I think I'm gonna dye it black
and then get it pierced.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.249
What do you think?

27:46.541 --> 27:48.752
The neighborhood's changed a little.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.865
I hear they call you Buck now.
- Cap!

28:20.909 --> 28:23.954
I couldn't believe it when I got the call.
It's just...

28:24.371 --> 28:27.457
Oh, hey, what am I doing?
Come in. Come in.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.418
How about some decaf?
- Sure.

28:31.795 --> 28:33.463
What's a decaf?

28:42.472 --> 28:46.643
I'm sorry, Steve,
but for the rest of us, time moved on.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.521
Has she had a good life?
- She has.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.731
We were so devastated,

28:52.315 --> 28:54.859
and then, over the years, Gail and I just...

28:55.151 --> 28:59.656
Well, you know.
- It's okay. Listen, is she here?

29:00.156 --> 29:01.295
Upstairs.

29:01.395 --> 29:03.297
It's hard for her, you know?

29:03.397 --> 29:04.862
She needs more time.

29:04.962 --> 29:06.538
I hope you understand.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.169
What do you hear from the guys?

29:34.858 --> 29:39.104
Everything I knew, everyone I cared for,
they're all gone.

29:39.204 --> 29:40.793
Steve, listen to me.

29:40.893 --> 29:42.795
You should have left me in the ice, General.

29:42.895 --> 29:44.985
You haven't lost everything, son.

29:45.085 --> 29:49.080
You still have your country,
and we need you now more than ever.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.096
Why me, General?

30:13.196 --> 30:15.391
Because you're the only one
who has faced this enemy

30:15.491 --> 30:16.725
and defeated them.

30:16.825 --> 30:18.372
I just don't think I'm ready to lead.

30:18.472 --> 30:20.946
Well, I do. Here, get to know your team.

30:22.113 --> 30:23.398
What's his story?

30:23.498 --> 30:26.735
He flies, hurls lightning, makes rain.
That sort of thing.

30:26.835 --> 30:28.549
People can do that now?

30:28.649 --> 30:31.657
Some, but this guy thinks he can do it
because he's Thor.

30:31.757 --> 30:34.222
Thor?
- As in the Norse god of thunder.

30:34.322 --> 30:35.681
And what do you think?

30:35.781 --> 30:37.913
I think he's a few rounds short of a full clip,

30:38.013 --> 30:40.749
but there's no getting over
those powers of his.

30:40.849 --> 30:44.127
I have faced down the frost giants
of Jotumheim,

30:44.227 --> 30:46.359
dark elves from Svartalfheim,

30:46.459 --> 30:49.069
even the fire demon Surtur himself,

30:49.169 --> 30:52.969
so your threats matter nothing to me,
whale killer.

30:53.069 --> 30:54.846
<i>I won't be warning you again.</i>

30:54.946 --> 30:58.691
<i>Either turn around and let us pass,
or things will get serious.</i>

30:59.400 --> 31:01.611
We don't want your kind around here.

31:01.736 --> 31:03.939
Oh, but things are serious,

31:04.039 --> 31:06.650
and though we are
but peaceful demonstrators,

31:06.750 --> 31:09.577
do not assume we cannot be provoked.

31:11.788 --> 31:12.997
Like that.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.997
Return to port.

32:04.007 --> 32:06.092
Please, wait for me below.

32:10.179 --> 32:13.099
Nicholas Fury, never a pleasure.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.176
Hello, Goldilocks.

32:15.276 --> 32:17.491
And Captain. You are well, I hope.

32:17.591 --> 32:19.889
I don't believe we've met.

32:19.989 --> 32:22.066
We have not, officially.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.569
Thirsty?

32:25.862 --> 32:29.358
Asgardian mead, nectar of the gods.

32:29.458 --> 32:32.577
Guaranteed to make you feel immortal.
- No, thanks.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.697
I hope you are not here to arrest us

32:35.797 --> 32:38.074
for our recent protests
in Washington, General.

32:38.174 --> 32:40.472
It was a peaceful demonstration until...

32:40.572 --> 32:43.413
Until you were provoked. Yes, I know.

32:43.513 --> 32:46.979
Actually, the Captain and I are here
to extend an invitation.

32:47.079 --> 32:49.628
We're forming a team
to fend off a global threat,

32:49.728 --> 32:51.220
so what do you say?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.389
This.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.558
And this.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.991
Thor, this threat is very real.

32:59.091 --> 33:00.930
Go back to your paymasters, General,

33:01.030 --> 33:05.664
and tell them that the son of Odin
is not interested in the wars of man.

33:05.764 --> 33:07.987
Thor...
- Not interested.

33:09.405 --> 33:13.368
But at the very least,
your team will have a conscience.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.745
Safe passage, my friend.

33:16.454 --> 33:17.872
You, too.

33:23.628 --> 33:26.422
Sir, what happened down there?
Were we attacked?

33:27.882 --> 33:30.218
Yeah, by Bruce Banner.

33:30.593 --> 33:32.671
There's a monster inside the good doctor.

33:32.771 --> 33:33.901
A monster?

33:34.001 --> 33:36.007
That's what happens
when a guy shares space

33:36.107 --> 33:39.594
with an explosion of gamma radiation
and survives.

33:39.694 --> 33:42.076
I don't believe it. He seems so normal.

33:42.176 --> 33:44.641
Every time he finds himself
even a little upset,

33:44.741 --> 33:46.413
that beast comes out.

33:46.513 --> 33:49.041
The madder he gets, the stronger he gets,

33:49.141 --> 33:50.918
the more landscape he levels.

33:51.018 --> 33:53.483
He becomes raw, unleashed rage,

33:53.583 --> 33:56.953
a hulking monster
right out of your worst nightmares.

34:20.560 --> 34:24.806
That's Captain America?
He looks so young.

34:24.906 --> 34:27.350
Yeah, well,
he's about 60 years too old for you,

34:27.449 --> 34:29.694
so you can pick your tongue up
off the floor now.

34:35.074 --> 34:38.235
So, Fury, who have you got in mind
to lead this little scout troop?

34:38.335 --> 34:41.289
Kind of early for a promotion, isn't it, Pym?

34:43.123 --> 34:45.159
All right, everyone listen up.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.808
You're now officially part
of Project Avenger.

34:47.908 --> 34:51.549
You'll be working as a unit
under the command of Captain America.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.210
Great. We'll all end up on ice.

34:54.310 --> 34:55.887
So let's get started.

34:59.932 --> 35:02.614
Hey, Tin Man! Come back for a rematch?

35:02.714 --> 35:04.053
Pym, that's enough.

35:04.153 --> 35:06.063
Okay, now that we're all here.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.620
May 2, 1945,

35:08.720 --> 35:11.457
a secret Nazi fortress
off the coast of Norway,

35:11.557 --> 35:13.625
designed and built to launch this,

35:13.725 --> 35:15.190
a nuclear warhead.

35:15.290 --> 35:18.234
Fortunately, it was scuttled
before it could reach Washington,

35:18.334 --> 35:22.301
and we owe a great debt of gratitude
to the brave soldier responsible.

35:22.401 --> 35:26.972
General, how did the Nazis
manage to acquire nuclear capabilities?

35:27.072 --> 35:29.850
With a little help. Extraterrestrials.

35:29.950 --> 35:32.582
Oh, come on. Little green men?

35:32.682 --> 35:35.426
Mr. Pym, I have seen these things.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.846
They've killed my men,
so they are very real.

35:40.473 --> 35:44.727
And just before they went into hiding,
the unit photographer took these.

35:45.061 --> 35:47.355
The Germans called them Chitauri.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.870
Hiding? Why are they still here?

35:49.970 --> 35:52.539
We don't know,
but they move around in three ships

35:52.639 --> 35:55.772
and like to buzz our nuclear power plants
and military facilities.

35:55.872 --> 35:57.941
We finally figured out how to track them,

35:58.041 --> 36:01.548
using a satellite
to detect the unusual metal in their hulls.

36:01.648 --> 36:03.822
This is what they thought of that idea.

36:03.922 --> 36:06.040
<i>We're burning up! We're burning...</i>

36:07.917 --> 36:09.752
Oh, my God.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.853
So how did you get a line
on the metal they use?

36:14.953 --> 36:17.919
One of their ships was destroyed
when the Nazi warhead detonated.

36:18.019 --> 36:20.012
That was our first lucky break.

36:22.640 --> 36:26.365
The second, the aliens neglected
to recover every piece of its wreckage.

36:26.465 --> 36:28.938
We got this hull panel and some fragments.

36:30.398 --> 36:33.234
What kind of alloy is this?
- Unknown.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.040
We call it vibranium,

36:35.140 --> 36:38.447
but whatever it is,
it absorbs energy like a sponge.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.604
Barring a nuclear blast,
nothing can penetrate it.

36:57.704 --> 36:59.844
Well, nothing except more vibranium.

37:02.138 --> 37:04.799
Unfortunately, the amount we've recovered
is minimal.

37:04.899 --> 37:07.573
Is Stark Enterprises working
on a way to counteract it?

37:07.673 --> 37:09.116
Oh, please.

37:09.216 --> 37:10.909
Unless there's a decent buck to be made,

37:11.009 --> 37:14.017
Tony will just backburner us
for the next 12 months.

37:14.117 --> 37:17.278
I don't know how you guys put up
with that arrogant jerk.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.752
So the bottom line is,
we can't find these ships,

37:20.852 --> 37:22.421
and we can't shoot them down if we do.

37:22.521 --> 37:25.528
Am I correct?
- I never said this was gonna be easy,

37:25.628 --> 37:28.372
so if any of you want out, tell me now.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.549
I had to learn everything about you.

39:03.926 --> 39:05.169
You'll be happy to know

39:05.269 --> 39:08.597
that the analysis of your blood
has yielded exciting results.

39:09.598 --> 39:12.093
Dr. Banner, I know about the Hulk.

39:12.193 --> 39:17.432
You have to understand,
the Hulk has ruined everything in my life.

39:17.532 --> 39:21.519
My work, my identity, my relationships.

39:21.619 --> 39:23.438
And you think the serum can help you?

39:23.538 --> 39:27.483
Yes! That monster is a menace
because he can't be controlled,

39:27.583 --> 39:30.278
but the very principles
of the Super Soldier process

39:30.378 --> 39:33.489
indicate that such transmutations
can be controlled.

39:33.589 --> 39:37.201
He can be a benefit to humanity,
just like you are.

39:37.301 --> 39:39.391
I don't know
if this was a blessing or a curse.

39:39.491 --> 39:42.331
Why?
- All I ever wanted was to serve my country

39:42.431 --> 39:45.397
and have a normal life,
but I'll never have a normal life.

39:45.497 --> 39:49.109
I expected you
to be the one person to understand.

39:49.209 --> 39:51.883
We all have our place in this fight,
Dr. Banner.

39:51.983 --> 39:55.644
You are a man of science.
Use that to leave your mark on the world.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.689
We're finished here, Captain.
Thank you for coming.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.401
Yes?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.278
On my way, General.

40:15.206 --> 40:17.958
Oh, no! Oh, no!

40:26.050 --> 40:27.343
Leave me alone!

40:31.180 --> 40:33.257
You've been ignoring your meds!

40:33.357 --> 40:36.260
Betty, I can't focus.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.854
You know the Hulk will destroy everything.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.765
I didn't ask for any of this.

40:40.865 --> 40:44.151
Neither did I.
You're not the only victim here.

40:50.366 --> 40:51.838
What's the crisis, General?

40:51.938 --> 40:53.465
Approximately 20 minutes ago,

40:53.565 --> 40:56.906
a high-security SHIELD facility
was breached by a Chitauri alien.

40:57.006 --> 41:00.167
He then proceeded to kill
every security officer on site.

41:02.837 --> 41:05.540
<i>My guess is,
he's after the Shield One satellites,</i>

41:05.640 --> 41:08.425
<i>the same kind
they pushed out of orbit yesterday.</i>

41:08.884 --> 41:10.690
<i>He's sealed himself in and activated</i>

41:10.790 --> 41:13.131
<i>the automated defense system
surrounding the center hub.</i>

41:13.231 --> 41:15.307
<i>We've been unable to disable it.</i>

41:15.599 --> 41:18.761
Captain, we cannot afford
to lose those satellites,

41:18.861 --> 41:21.868
but just as important,
I want that Chitauri delivered to me.

41:21.968 --> 41:23.266
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

41:23.366 --> 41:25.101
Here's your new issue.

41:25.201 --> 41:28.604
The shield is a blend of adamantium
and vibranium fragments.

41:28.704 --> 41:30.739
No one will be denting this one.

41:31.157 --> 41:32.241
Well done.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.987
Tell me, are you issuing trashcan lids
to the whole team or just him?

41:36.087 --> 41:37.071
Shut up, Hank.

41:37.171 --> 41:39.907
You waste vibranium on his shield
when we need it for weapons?

41:40.007 --> 41:43.586
In the hands of Captain America,
that shield is a weapon.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.105
Glad you could join us.

42:11.205 --> 42:14.617
<i>Don't put me on the payroll just yet.
Let's see how this goes.</i>

42:28.589 --> 42:31.759
General Fury!
The intruder has hacked into our database.

42:32.301 --> 42:35.609
He's downloading everything.
Blueprints, security protocols.

42:35.709 --> 42:36.714
Lock him out.

42:36.814 --> 42:39.350
I'm trying, but nothing's working.

42:56.492 --> 42:58.694
<i>Our orders are to secure the center hub
of the plant,</i>

42:58.794 --> 43:00.079
<i>which is one level below ground.</i>

43:00.579 --> 43:03.824
To get there, we have to first make it
past the automated weaponry.

43:03.924 --> 43:07.203
I can get through without setting them off.
- Wasp, not yet. Wasp!

43:07.303 --> 43:09.463
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

43:09.672 --> 43:11.207
Take it easy, old man.

43:11.307 --> 43:14.009
Now you're gonna see
what today's heroes can do.

43:14.843 --> 43:17.880
Iron Man, scan through the roof
to determine the alien's position.

43:17.980 --> 43:20.153
Black Widow, take the loading dock.

43:20.253 --> 43:21.926
I'll take the east entrance.

43:22.026 --> 43:25.158
Giant-Man, you'll remain here.
If he escapes, you stop him.

43:25.258 --> 43:26.555
Great plan, coach.

43:26.655 --> 43:30.017
Bench your most powerful player.
- Those are your orders, Pym.

43:30.117 --> 43:31.819
Let's go!

43:43.372 --> 43:46.292
The central corridor is clear.
I'm proceeding ahead.

43:57.886 --> 43:59.513
Loading bay is clear.

44:01.974 --> 44:04.802
<i>The intruder is still in the center hub,
one floor down.</i>

44:04.902 --> 44:08.564
<i>I'm detecting what could be
infrared triggers all around Wasp.</i>

44:16.196 --> 44:17.823
Okay, everyone advance!

44:17.990 --> 44:20.443
Wasp, that corridor is too hot.

44:20.543 --> 44:22.882
<i>Maintain position
until you can be extracted.</i>

44:22.982 --> 44:25.247
Don't worry. At this size, nothing...

44:26.540 --> 44:28.792
Jan! Janet!

44:33.464 --> 44:35.791
Wasp, are you all right?
<i>- I'll find her.</i>

44:35.891 --> 44:38.218
No, Iron Man, stay in position.

44:41.138 --> 44:44.141
<i>Sorry, Captain.
Rescuing ladies is what I do.</i>

45:21.512 --> 45:23.264
Jan! Janet!

45:23.972 --> 45:25.383
Pym, back off!

45:25.483 --> 45:27.017
You're gonna bring the whole place down.

46:09.601 --> 46:12.855
These amateurs!
They're going to get us killed.

46:13.522 --> 46:16.984
Thanks. I... I'm not used to being rescued.

46:29.037 --> 46:31.039
Move! Move! Move!

46:41.884 --> 46:45.512
Help! He's not getting any air,
and I can't get his helmet off.

47:06.617 --> 47:09.828
Listen, about
that 'arrogant jerk' comment earlier...

47:10.412 --> 47:12.789
Stark! I should have known.

47:13.332 --> 47:16.452
Sir, I'm afraid...
- Save it, Captain. I know what happened.

47:16.552 --> 47:18.516
You let that alien blow up the satellites

47:18.616 --> 47:21.123
and steal everything there is to know
about SHIELD.

47:21.223 --> 47:23.396
Do you realize
how vulnerable that makes us?

47:23.496 --> 47:26.900
Nick, this wasn't his fault.
- No, you're all to blame.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.028
You disobeyed orders.
You deviated from the plan,

47:30.128 --> 47:32.968
and if Hank hadn't left his post,
that intruder would have been ours.

47:33.068 --> 47:34.845
I was trying to save my wife.

47:34.945 --> 47:36.743
That was not your mission.

47:36.843 --> 47:40.079
I got no use for hotshot amateurs.
You're fired, Pym.

47:40.179 --> 47:42.986
Oh, yeah? Well, good luck winning this
without us, Fury.

47:45.239 --> 47:46.615
I'm sorry.
- Janet!

47:48.242 --> 47:50.661
This is exactly why I work alone.

47:51.787 --> 47:54.623
You two, report back to base.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.336
Captain, where are you going? Captain!

48:00.254 --> 48:02.881
Let him go. I will talk to him.

48:10.639 --> 48:13.384
Put the base on alert.
We're going to Defcon 4.

48:13.484 --> 48:14.810
Yes, sir.

48:16.645 --> 48:18.814
And patch me through to the SSP lab.

48:21.024 --> 48:22.121
<i>Yes?
- Banner,</i>

48:22.221 --> 48:24.415
I wanna know the exact status
of that serum.

48:24.515 --> 48:27.489
Promising news, General.
I think we're finally ready.

48:27.656 --> 48:30.025
Good.
I want you to prepare for all 12 candidates.

48:30.125 --> 48:32.361
Twelve? Well, isn't that rushing it a bit?

48:32.461 --> 48:34.572
Banner, are you ready, or aren't you?

48:34.672 --> 48:36.790
I am. I'll get right on it.

49:00.897 --> 49:02.608
Where are you running to?

49:02.983 --> 49:05.277
You have nowhere to go, Captain.

49:07.487 --> 49:08.864
Steve, wait.

49:09.865 --> 49:11.199
Please.

49:12.784 --> 49:17.865
Your performance today,
it is to be admired, regardless of...

49:17.965 --> 49:21.035
I failed.
- No, the team failed you.

49:21.135 --> 49:22.348
I was in command.

49:22.448 --> 49:24.121
You were not responsible.

49:24.221 --> 49:27.416
I told the General I wasn't ready for this.
Someone could have been killed.

49:27.516 --> 49:30.815
And what if they were?
We all make that sacrifice going in.

49:30.915 --> 49:32.421
It is not your burden.

49:32.521 --> 49:36.988
Steve, you are someone who gives his all
for what he believes in,

49:37.088 --> 49:41.688
and whether I get hurt or whether I die,
you are a man I'm willing to follow.

49:42.397 --> 49:44.650
Do yourself a favor. Don't.

49:48.528 --> 49:51.607
I just think that once General Fury
cools off, we should go talk to him.

49:51.707 --> 49:55.653
Forget it, Jan. Have you no dignity?
- It was our fault, Hank, ours.

49:55.753 --> 49:59.239
If we'd just listened to Steve...
- Why are you sticking up for that guy?

49:59.339 --> 50:01.012
It was a mistake to put him in charge.

50:01.112 --> 50:04.411
It's always everyone else's fault
and never yours, right, Hank?

50:04.511 --> 50:05.754
Yeah, right.

50:29.486 --> 50:31.876
Professor Ross, where's Banner?

50:31.976 --> 50:33.982
He's supposed
to be getting the serum ready.

50:34.082 --> 50:36.952
It's finished? He didn't say anything to me.

50:49.756 --> 50:50.833
We have a problem.

50:50.933 --> 50:53.898
All I've found so far
are analysis on Bruce's blood.

50:53.998 --> 50:56.338
What's he doing
processing his own blood?

50:56.438 --> 50:57.889
Where are the other trials?

51:19.119 --> 51:21.204
There are no other trials.
- What?

51:21.496 --> 51:24.332
All this time,
he's only been working on himself.

51:30.255 --> 51:32.090
Wait! I can explain.

51:32.382 --> 51:35.106
Do you know what you've done?
I need those soldiers.

51:35.206 --> 51:37.045
Not if you have the Hulk.

51:37.145 --> 51:38.172
You're crazy.

51:38.272 --> 51:41.558
No, with the serum, I can control him.

51:43.769 --> 51:44.853
What?

51:45.771 --> 51:47.314
Move to Defcon 5.

51:47.689 --> 51:50.788
The three Chitauri ships will be here
in less than five minutes.

51:50.888 --> 51:54.404
If we survive this attack,
you're gonna hang for this.

52:00.202 --> 52:01.369
Oh, no.

52:08.376 --> 52:09.586
Bruce!

52:10.504 --> 52:11.963
What are you doing?

52:13.215 --> 52:15.592
I'll fix this, Betty. I promise.

52:21.389 --> 52:22.766
Stop, please!

52:23.350 --> 52:25.060
Get out of there, Bruce!

53:07.769 --> 53:09.104
It worked.

53:09.771 --> 53:12.140
Betty, see? I told you.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.943
Bruce, is that really you?

53:15.819 --> 53:18.697
Yes, everything's gonna be okay.

54:56.044 --> 54:57.504
Damn!

55:13.895 --> 55:15.397
They're shutting us down.

55:47.137 --> 55:48.888
Vibranium-tipped.

56:08.950 --> 56:11.494
I need to go, Betty. Get to safety.

56:23.965 --> 56:27.010
The Hulk's out there, but Bruce has control.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.679
Oh, this just keeps getting better.

57:09.469 --> 57:12.430
This is my fight! Stay out of it!

57:52.011 --> 57:53.221
Oh, hell.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.107
Good to see you, Stark.

58:04.858 --> 58:07.443
<i>You're lucky.
I had an opening in my schedule.</i>

58:44.689 --> 58:48.401
<i>Vibranium armor, Hank.
Let's see what we can do with that.</i>

58:51.321 --> 58:52.864
Serve him up.

59:38.368 --> 59:39.619
Yeah!

59:40.328 --> 59:42.301
My apologies for the delay, Captain.

59:42.401 --> 59:45.972
I was vanquishing bog boars from Alfheim
when I learned of the attack.

59:46.072 --> 59:47.744
Who's the chick with the hammer?

59:47.844 --> 59:50.421
<i>Whoever she is, I'm glad she's on our side.</i>

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:09.357
Dr. Banner! Bruce, you did it.

01:01:12.045 --> 01:01:15.840
Rock giants crumble under the blow
of the mighty Mjolnir.

01:01:16.758 --> 01:01:20.678
I fear this brute won't be as obliging.

01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:40.281
Betty, how can we stop him?

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.755
He won't stop until everyone's dead.

01:01:42.855 --> 01:01:45.612
What about Bruce's medicine?
Will it work on the Hulk?

01:01:45.712 --> 01:01:47.697
Maybe, at 20 times the dose.

01:01:47.797 --> 01:01:49.499
Go get as much as you can.

01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:34.460
Leave him alone, Hulk. Fight me.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.999
You're still a little man, Banner.

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:03.698
Now, knock it off, or I'm gonna squish you.

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:16.669
No!

01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:26.137
No, Hulk!

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:03.591
Hulk, over here!

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:27.406
Hey, we're not finished yet.

01:04:34.455 --> 01:04:35.456
Here!

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.751
Iron Man, Hank, slow him down.

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:42.088
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:50.721
Tag, you're it.

01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:59.522
I can't get a bead on him.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.484
Wasp, distract him.
- I'm on it.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:47.862
Stop!

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:54.327
Hulk! Hulk, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm here now.

01:05:57.038 --> 01:05:58.748
I won't let them hurt you.

01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:02.848
What is she doing? He'll kill her.
- No, he won't.

01:06:02.948 --> 01:06:06.631
She's trying to calm him down
so he won't burn through the sedative.

01:06:07.506 --> 01:06:10.760
I need you to stop fighting, okay?

01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:13.387
It's time to rest.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:17.091
Everything's going to be all right,
I promise.

01:06:17.191 --> 01:06:18.809
Betty...

01:06:35.743 --> 01:06:37.278
How long has he been like that?

01:06:37.378 --> 01:06:39.551
He hasn't moved since we brought him in.

01:06:39.651 --> 01:06:41.115
Want me to let him know you're here?

01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:44.001
No, I wouldn't know what to say.

01:06:48.798 --> 01:06:49.924
Hey, Cap.

01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:54.428
I brought someone by to see you.

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:06.941
He needed this.

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:08.976
So did she.

01:07:09.076 --> 01:07:11.041
I've had a good life, Steve.

01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:12.584
I'm happy to hear that.

01:07:12.684 --> 01:07:14.907
Now it's your turn.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:36.546
To Captain America,

01:07:36.646 --> 01:07:40.766
the man who fought to the finish
defending this bunch of ingrates.

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:05.332
General.

01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:08.002
I still can't believe it.

01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:10.129
It's finally over.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:12.915
Those hotshots actually pulled it together.

01:08:13.015 --> 01:08:16.385
Yes, they did. They had a great leader.
