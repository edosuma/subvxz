00:36.397 --> 00:38.598
[Sobbing continues]

00:46.775 --> 00:49.275
[Clock ticking]

01:07.262 --> 01:09.662
My mom around?

01:09.697 --> 01:11.898
I'm not sure.
I haven't seen her this morning.

01:11.933 --> 01:14.550
- I feel like I haven't seen her in ages.
- I know.

01:14.585 --> 01:17.436
She picked up some extra
hours at the Dirty Robber.

01:17.472 --> 01:19.438
I can't believe I'm actually
going to say this,

01:19.474 --> 01:21.307
- but I miss her.
- Me too.

01:21.342 --> 01:24.777
I know. Let's make a plan to
do something together tonight.

01:24.813 --> 01:26.313
Yeah, you know what, the Bruins

01:26.314 --> 01:28.648
- are in town all week.
- So?

01:28.683 --> 01:30.716
Well, so, I could get tickets
for a hockey game.

01:30.752 --> 01:32.685
[gasps]
I have a better idea.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.388
How about jell-o shots
and arm wrestling?

01:35.423 --> 01:37.590
Y... You're being sarcastic.
[Chuckles]

01:37.625 --> 01:39.525
Come on.
Let's have a girls' night.

01:39.561 --> 01:41.661
She can go to a hockey game
with Frankie.

01:41.696 --> 01:44.530
Well, what do you want to do?
Wine tasting and... waxing?

01:44.566 --> 01:47.867
No. [Laughing] No, why don't
we just make dinner here,

01:47.902 --> 01:51.470
- then watch a movie together?
- Oh. Okay, yeah. I like that.

01:51.506 --> 01:53.606
But only as long
as you're doing the cooking.

01:53.641 --> 01:54.974
Great.

01:55.009 --> 01:56.809
- As long as you're doing the dishes.
- Deal.

01:56.845 --> 01:58.511
Ooh!
We should watch "Iron Man 3."

01:58.546 --> 02:01.547
- I don't think Ma's seen that one.
- No.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.349
No "Iron Man"
whatever the number is.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.752
Why don't we just see
something
with a little more

02:05.753 --> 02:08.554
- emotional resonance?
- Okay.

02:08.590 --> 02:09.989
As long as there are no subtitles,

02:10.024 --> 02:11.757
I don't care how much resonance it has.

02:11.793 --> 02:15.261
Mm...
"Terms of endearment."

02:15.296 --> 02:17.463
Isn't that the one
where the daughter dies

02:17.498 --> 02:19.532
- and the mother cries?
- Yes.

02:19.567 --> 02:22.768
- No.
- Okay. Uh...

02:22.804 --> 02:25.671
- "Steel magnolias."
- This is another dead daughter.

02:25.707 --> 02:27.707
Is there something that
you're trying to tell me?

02:27.742 --> 02:29.642
- "Mommie dearest."
- Hell, no!

02:29.677 --> 02:33.512
- Hi.
- Why don't we let her decide?

02:33.548 --> 02:35.014
Decide what?

02:35.049 --> 02:37.516
Well, we wanted to do something
tonight, the three of us.

02:37.552 --> 02:39.385
Yeah, we were thinking
of having dinner,

02:39.420 --> 02:40.720
watching a movie together.

02:40.755 --> 02:42.421
What kind of film
would you like to see?

02:42.457 --> 02:45.825
- I can't tonight.
- Oh. Are you working late again?

02:45.860 --> 02:48.961
- No.
- Then what's the problem?

02:50.665 --> 02:55.668
I'm taking a class at night, a...
cooking class.

02:55.703 --> 02:58.771
- Oh, what kind of cooking?
- French.

02:58.806 --> 03:02.541
<i>My favorite ... pot-au-feu,
choucroute, steak frite.</i>

03:02.577 --> 03:04.343
- I know. I love it.
- Mm-hmm.

03:04.379 --> 03:05.845
You love it?

03:05.880 --> 03:08.781
- You love French food?
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.816 --> 03:10.983
What other kind of French food
do you love?

03:11.019 --> 03:16.055
Well, I-I like it all.
French onion soup and...

03:16.090 --> 03:21.627
French fries, French toast...
[Cellphone vibrating]

03:21.663 --> 03:23.329
[Ringtone playing]

03:23.364 --> 03:24.497
[Cellphone ringing]

03:24.532 --> 03:26.966
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

03:27.001 --> 03:28.000
Hey, hi!

03:30.638 --> 03:31.938
<i>Okay.</i>

03:48.552 --> 03:50.689
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

<b>6x03 - Deadly Harvest</b>

04:01.636 --> 04:04.036
<i>I mean, when has my mother</i>

04:04.072 --> 04:07.740
- ever said no to anything with us?
- That would be never.

04:07.775 --> 04:09.742
Exactly.
Something is off.

04:09.777 --> 04:12.812
At least she's being more independent.
Isn't that what you wanted?

04:12.847 --> 04:14.613
Not when it interferes
with my plans.

04:19.954 --> 04:24.623
[Insects buzzing]

04:26.661 --> 04:31.364
I love the body farm.
Isn't this amazing?

04:31.399 --> 04:34.834
Yeah, in a "Walking dead" sort of way.

04:34.869 --> 04:36.769
Who thinks of something like this?

04:36.804 --> 04:39.873
Well, BCU just wanted a
natural setting in order

04:39.874 --> 04:42.942
<i>to study the decomposition
of the dead bodies.</i>

04:42.977 --> 04:45.378
I just wish it was here
when I was in school.

04:45.413 --> 04:47.513
Why is she so chipper this morning?

04:47.548 --> 04:49.582
What, are you kidding?
This is like Disneyland for her.

04:49.617 --> 04:51.684
[Chuckles] Yeah. Plenty of
dead bodies to play with,

04:51.719 --> 04:55.087
- and none of the long lines.
- BCU in the middle of a garbage strike?

04:55.123 --> 04:58.624
No. Two of the research
bodies were buried under trash.

04:58.659 --> 05:00.860
A student was moving the debris
aside with a little backhoe

05:00.895 --> 05:04.700
and accidentally dug up a third body,
which doesn't seem to belong here.

05:05.466 --> 05:06.866
What do you got?

05:06.901 --> 05:09.001
The cyclone fence around the
property is in good shape,

05:09.037 --> 05:11.604
and there's a working
padlock on the front gate.

05:11.639 --> 05:13.839
It's not Fort Knox,
but the place is secure.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.709
- What about security cameras?
- There are only three cameras,

05:16.744 --> 05:19.145
and they're all focused
on aboveground corpses

05:19.180 --> 05:21.747
to capture time-lapse
images of decomposition.

05:21.783 --> 05:24.116
Don't tell Maura. She'll
want to watch every minute.

05:24.152 --> 05:27.086
All right, I'll need you to
watch the tape from the cameras,

05:27.121 --> 05:29.722
see if they picked up
anything that can help us out.

05:29.757 --> 05:32.558
Corpse cam.
Can do.

05:34.128 --> 05:35.761
Okay. Level of decomposition

05:35.797 --> 05:38.564
indicates she's been in the
ground for at least a month.

05:38.599 --> 05:42.134
- Any idea what killed her?
- No obvious signs of trauma,

05:42.170 --> 05:44.837
So I can't determine a cause of death
until I complete a full autopsy.

05:44.872 --> 05:49.875
Somebody knew this was the
perfect place to dump a body.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.446
<i>I went over all this with the first cop.</i>

05:53.481 --> 05:58.551
- Well, we'd like to hear it again.
- Besides myself, students, other faculty,

05:58.586 --> 06:01.087
groundskeepers, delivery people.

06:01.122 --> 06:03.823
Well, what about at night?
Is there security after hours?

06:03.858 --> 06:06.092
No, but the grounds are
locked up at 9:00 P.M.

06:06.127 --> 06:09.128
by a grad student.
He's very reliable.

06:09.163 --> 06:12.531
We'll need his name
and a list of all the other people

06:12.567 --> 06:14.900
- that have access to the property.
- Of course.

06:14.936 --> 06:17.770
So, there's no chance that this
is one of your research corpses?

06:17.805 --> 06:21.006
- No, no, it's definitely not mine.
- How can you be so sure?

06:21.042 --> 06:22.775
I was brought here to implement systems

06:22.810 --> 06:24.643
that ensure this
facility runs flawlessly,

06:24.679 --> 06:26.512
and that's exactly what I've done.

06:26.547 --> 06:28.747
Trust me, I-I know how
many bodies are here

06:28.783 --> 06:30.883
and precisely where they're all placed.

06:30.918 --> 06:33.018
And yet, we've found an extra body.

06:33.054 --> 06:36.489
Which would lead some to believe
the operation isn't "flawless."

06:36.524 --> 06:38.891
So, why don't you walk
us through the process

06:38.926 --> 06:42.194
of what happens when you
receive a body? Please.

06:43.231 --> 06:44.864
Our corpses all come from people

06:44.899 --> 06:46.932
who have donated their body
for scientific research.

06:46.968 --> 06:48.667
When they arrive here, they're washed,

06:48.703 --> 06:50.503
fingerprinted, photographed, and tagged,

06:50.538 --> 06:52.638
and then each body is
placed in or above the ground

06:52.673 --> 06:55.641
and then carefully notated on this map.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.177
<i>Korsak: I would suggest you
do an inventory to make sure</i>

06:58.212 --> 07:00.913
there are no un-notated
bodies laying around.

07:00.948 --> 07:03.516
We will.

07:03.551 --> 07:06.051
So, uh, if there's nothing else,

07:06.087 --> 07:10.122
- I need to get back to my students.
- One more thing.

07:10.158 --> 07:13.759
Do you know when the trash was placed
on the two research bodies?

07:15.963 --> 07:19.532
34 days ago.
How long are you gonna be here?

07:19.567 --> 07:22.735
I'm afraid that your presence
is interrupting my teaching schedule.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.905
Well, I suggest you get used
to working around our presence

07:25.940 --> 07:27.907
because we're gonna be here for a while.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.818
From an academic
perspective, Dr. Carlson

07:39.854 --> 07:43.055
is a highly respected
forensic anthropologist.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.324
Well, from a people's
perspective, he's a dick.

07:45.359 --> 07:47.293
[Chuckles]
Did he give you anything?

07:47.328 --> 07:49.061
No, just that the research bodies

07:49.096 --> 07:51.297
were buried and covered
with trash 34 days ago.

07:51.332 --> 07:54.900
Okay, and our victim was in the ground
for at least a month.

07:54.936 --> 07:58.804
Mm, gives us approximately
four days window

07:58.839 --> 08:00.839
for... our body to be
dumped in the ground.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.275
Oh!
I spoke to Frankie.

08:03.311 --> 08:05.978
He doesn't know anything
about a cooking class for Ma.

08:06.013 --> 08:07.746
Why is that significant?

08:07.782 --> 08:09.582
Well, she can't keep
anything to herself,

08:09.617 --> 08:12.284
yet she doesn't tell any of us
that she's taking a cooking class?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.819
She's up to something.

08:13.854 --> 08:15.621
[Chuckling] Okay.
You're starting to sound

08:15.656 --> 08:17.256
more like her mother than her daughter.

08:17.291 --> 08:20.726
I'm telling you... just watch.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.928
- Okay.
- Ew. What do we know about her?

08:22.964 --> 08:27.066
Well, she's still a Jane Doe.
I wasn't able to recover prints

08:27.101 --> 08:30.169
due to the decomposition of
the epidermis on her fingers.

08:30.204 --> 08:32.938
So I sent out a tissue
sample for DNA analysis,

08:32.974 --> 08:35.006
but there's no way of knowing
if she's even in the system.

08:35.042 --> 08:38.143
Is a tox screen even possible?

08:38.179 --> 08:41.212
Only through hair. The
lab already has a sample.

08:41.249 --> 08:43.600
I believe she's in her
mid 30s, based on the lack

08:43.601 --> 08:45.951
of osteoporosis and the
widening of the pelvis base.

08:45.987 --> 08:49.288
Also, she was wearing an old housecoat

08:49.323 --> 08:51.323
and house slippers when she was buried.

08:51.359 --> 08:54.226
That's an odd choice
for someone in her 30s.

08:55.196 --> 08:57.663
Okay, uh, what about cause of death?

08:57.698 --> 09:01.267
Well, there were abrasions
in the tissue around the neck

09:01.302 --> 09:04.903
and hemp fibers in the
wound consistent with a rope.

09:04.939 --> 09:07.773
But there were no fractures
in the C1 or C2 vertebrae,

09:07.808 --> 09:10.309
which would be consistent
with a violent hanging.

09:10.344 --> 09:12.645
So you think she was
strangled with a rope?

09:12.680 --> 09:14.664
If that were the case,
we'd expect to find

09:14.665 --> 09:16.649
the hyoid bone fractured,
which it wasn't.

09:16.684 --> 09:21.186
Okay, well, what is the
wound consistent with?

09:21.222 --> 09:26.152
- Suicide by hanging.
- Really?

09:26.227 --> 09:28.327
So she hung herself

09:28.362 --> 09:31.830
and then drove her body
over to the body farm

09:31.866 --> 09:36.109
and then tucked herself
in under some garbage.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.804
I don't think that happened.

09:47.374 --> 09:50.342
Yeah, but why make this
look like a suicide?

09:50.377 --> 09:53.545
Maybe it was some sort of
weird ritualistic killing.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.946
I'll check VICAP,

09:54.982 --> 09:56.681
see if there have been
other staged suicides.

09:56.717 --> 09:58.917
And we got to find another
way to i.d. this body.

09:58.952 --> 10:00.685
I'm looking at all the reports

10:00.721 --> 10:01.887
for women who have been
missing for at least a month.

10:01.922 --> 10:03.455
What about the list

10:03.490 --> 10:04.890
of everyone that had
access to the body farm?

10:04.925 --> 10:07.025
Professor Carlson
hasn't sent it over yet.

10:07.060 --> 10:11.130
You know what, you go sit in his chair
and tell him you're not leaving

10:11.131 --> 10:14.599
- until he gives you the list.
- You got it.

10:14.635 --> 10:17.536
I'll go wait in my chair
for the list to show up.

10:17.571 --> 10:19.771
I will wait here in my chair
for the list to show up.

10:19.807 --> 10:22.483
This is my chair, and I
defend it to the death.

10:23.524 --> 10:25.282
[Chuckles]

10:30.083 --> 10:35.604
- So, how was it?
- Mmm. It is still the best in town.

10:35.639 --> 10:36.121
[Chuckles]

10:36.156 --> 10:39.591
Ma, you know what, I've been thinking,
and I think it's great

10:39.626 --> 10:41.526
that you're taking
a French cooking class.

10:41.562 --> 10:45.130
Yeah, it ... it ...
I've been really enjoying it.

10:45.165 --> 10:48.800
Yeah? Well, what have
you made in class so far?

10:48.836 --> 10:51.937
Uh, what have I made in class so far?

10:51.972 --> 10:56.541
Well, let's see.
I made a-a really nice French dip.

10:56.577 --> 10:59.144
Yeah?
How do you make a French dip?

10:59.179 --> 11:02.414
How do you make a Fre...
Well, you, um...

11:02.449 --> 11:03.515
[Clears throat]

11:03.550 --> 11:06.017
- You take the roast beef...
- Mm-hmm.

11:06.053 --> 11:07.953
You know, you have to put
it in the oven, three...

11:07.988 --> 11:09.754
Do you remember when
Frankie broke your lamp?

11:09.790 --> 11:11.823
Yeah, my favorite green lamp?

11:11.859 --> 11:13.491
Mm-hmm.
And he kept denying it.

11:13.527 --> 11:15.126
[Chuckling] Yeah, but I was
onto him from the get-go.

11:15.162 --> 11:16.828
How? How did you know
he was lying about it?

11:16.864 --> 11:20.565
Because every time I asked
him what happened to that lamp,

11:20.601 --> 11:23.802
he would repeat the question
to buy himself some time

11:23.837 --> 11:27.639
to make up some kind
of lame, phony excuse.

11:27.674 --> 11:30.512
So, how do you make a French dip?

11:33.480 --> 11:36.465
Ma, you always told me that
you don't have to take time

11:36.466 --> 11:39.451
to come up with an answer
if you're telling the truth,

11:39.486 --> 11:42.153
and that is a tip that I still
use with my suspects today.

11:42.189 --> 11:43.722
So, I don't believe

11:43.757 --> 11:45.657
that you're taking a
French cooking class.

11:45.692 --> 11:49.097
I just can't figure out why
you'd lie to me about it.

11:49.596 --> 11:52.764
Okay, you're right.
I'm not taking a French cooking class.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.867
- I'm taking ice-skating lessons.
- What?!

11:55.903 --> 11:57.802
Well, that's why
I didn't want to tell you.

11:57.838 --> 12:00.672
Because, Ma, you're the
world's worst athlete!

12:00.707 --> 12:04.209
- I am not!
- What about when you took up golf?

12:04.244 --> 12:06.745
You sprained your wrist
getting the bag out of the cart.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.780
- Okay, that could have happened to anybody.
- Oh, yeah?

12:08.815 --> 12:09.748
You remember what happened

12:09.749 --> 12:10.682
- when you took up tennis?
- Psst!

12:10.717 --> 12:12.884
And what about when you
took up swimming at the "Y"?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.486
You almost drowned.

12:14.521 --> 12:16.755
Well, that's because I got
stuck on that safety line.

12:16.790 --> 12:21.493
- That line is there for your safety!
- Why can't you be supportive?

12:21.528 --> 12:23.061
Why can't you take up Bingo?

12:23.096 --> 12:25.497
[Cellphone vibrating] I'm
going to do what I want to do.

12:25.532 --> 12:26.898
You shouldn't be skating, Mom.

12:26.934 --> 12:30.001
- Ohh.
- You should not be skating! Rizzoli.

12:30.037 --> 12:31.636
[Sighs]

12:31.672 --> 12:34.739
What?
How is that even po...

12:34.775 --> 12:37.676
Fine. Yes. Fine.
I'm on my way. Okay.

12:39.613 --> 12:42.231
Did you know that female
athletes are twice as

12:42.232 --> 12:44.849
likely to sustain concussions
than male athletes?

12:44.885 --> 12:48.487
That means, given your athletic
prowess, you're like

12:48.488 --> 12:52.090
a zillion times more likely to end up
with a traumatic brain injury.

12:52.125 --> 12:55.060
When did you start reading
Maura's medical journals?

12:55.095 --> 12:56.661
It's not in some medical journal.

12:56.697 --> 13:00.198
That's from a much higher source ...
"ESPN Sportscenter."

13:00.233 --> 13:03.798
- [Chuckling] Oh, boy!
- You know what, Ma, just ...

13:03.833 --> 13:04.869
[Laughs]

13:04.905 --> 13:07.839
Please, no more ice skating.
Okay?

13:14.147 --> 13:18.121
- Fine.
- Thank you.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.129
[Police radio chatter]

13:34.868 --> 13:37.268
I cannot believe this.
How did this happen?

13:37.304 --> 13:38.903
That's what we're here to find out,

13:38.939 --> 13:40.739
but we're gonna need
your help, professor.

13:40.774 --> 13:43.679
Well, I'll assist you in any way I can.

13:44.378 --> 13:46.011
You're gonna love this.

13:46.046 --> 13:48.713
So, my mother is not
taking cooking classes.

13:48.749 --> 13:51.750
- She's taking ice-skating lessons.
- Why?

13:51.785 --> 13:53.865
I don't know.
She wouldn't say.

13:53.900 --> 13:54.510
And then when I asked her

13:54.511 --> 13:56.254
about it, she got all weir...
What is this?

13:56.289 --> 13:59.157
A male victim in a deeper grave.

13:59.192 --> 14:01.292
- How long has he been here?
- At least a year.

14:01.328 --> 14:04.262
It appears that he has a bullet
hole in the back of the head,

14:04.297 --> 14:07.015
and since I can't see an
exit wound, it seems likely

14:07.016 --> 14:10.633
that we'll recover a slug in
the decomposed brain matter.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.705
Male victim, gunshot wound
to the back of the head ...

14:13.740 --> 14:15.740
- execution?
- Hit man?

14:15.776 --> 14:17.942
Could be for him.
Less likely for her.

14:17.978 --> 14:19.277
Any connection between the victims?

14:19.312 --> 14:21.780
No way to know based
on existing forensics.

14:21.815 --> 14:24.945
You got to wonder if a serial
killer or the mob figured

14:24.946 --> 14:28.076
out this was the perfect
place to dump a body in Boston.

14:40.801 --> 14:42.767
Hey. You have an
official cause of death?

14:42.803 --> 14:44.169
Gunshot wound to the head.

14:44.204 --> 14:46.638
Our victim was killed
by a .22 caliber bullet.

14:46.673 --> 14:48.106
I sent it to IBIS for analysis.

14:48.141 --> 14:51.042
- Anything to identify this guy?
- Not so far.

14:51.078 --> 14:53.078
How about physical?
Anything set him apart?

14:53.113 --> 14:56.381
His left tibia and fibula were
fractured below the knee years ago,

14:56.416 --> 14:59.284
but it's a common injury
that alone won't help us.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.986
How about his clothes?

15:02.022 --> 15:04.656
He wore a t-shirt and
jeans from American Wear.

15:04.691 --> 15:07.443
I researched the brand,
and they've only been

15:07.444 --> 15:10.195
in business since 2007 and
they don't make housecoats.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.796
[Sighs]

15:11.832 --> 15:13.932
So we still have nothing
to connect our victims.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.498
I didn't say that.

15:16.837 --> 15:19.871
We found a long blond
hair on his t-shirt.

15:19.906 --> 15:24.075
- We think it came from our woman victim?
- We don't have to speculate.

15:24.111 --> 15:26.211
DNA testing confirms a match.

15:26.246 --> 15:28.046
So, we know our woman
had contact with our man

15:28.081 --> 15:31.248
- shortly before he was buried.
- Absolutely.

15:31.718 --> 15:33.840
Well, we know one thing for sure.

15:34.254 --> 15:36.623
He didn't kill her.

15:45.351 --> 15:47.718
Maybe the woman was
involved in the man's murder.

15:47.753 --> 15:51.054
Or maybe she was just a witness
and didn't think she was next.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.457
Did we get anything from
the missing person report?

15:53.492 --> 15:55.859
There's none from the woman
who's been missing for a month,

15:55.894 --> 15:57.828
but I had Frankie and
Nina refine the search.

15:57.863 --> 15:59.758
They're now looking for couples
who went missing

15:59.788 --> 16:02.032
- from the area at least a year ago.
- Nice.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.334
Oh, hey,
you're gonna want to see this.

16:07.473 --> 16:09.706
<i>We found a married
couple reported missing</i>

16:09.742 --> 16:11.908
<i>just over 12 months ago.</i>

16:11.944 --> 16:15.011
- Are they consistent with our victims?
- Height and hair color.

16:15.047 --> 16:16.480
And they disappeared
right around the same time

16:16.515 --> 16:17.981
we think our male victim was murdered.

16:18.016 --> 16:19.516
If this is our couple,
then what has the wife

16:19.551 --> 16:20.717
been doing for the past 11 months?

16:20.753 --> 16:22.986
And who's she been doing it with?

16:23.021 --> 16:26.623
- Who filed the missing persons report?
- The wife's sister.

16:30.796 --> 16:34.898
- What's up with Susie?
- Ah, she said she needed to see us.

16:34.933 --> 16:37.634
- Hey.
- Hey. That was fast.

16:37.669 --> 16:39.870
It sounded important.
What do you got?

16:39.905 --> 16:42.674
Well, I ran the bullet
we recovered from the victim's

16:42.675 --> 16:45.443
skull through IBIS and didn't get a hit.

16:45.444 --> 16:47.878
You had us rush all the
way down here for that?

16:47.913 --> 16:50.747
Oh, no. That's not
why I called you guys.

16:50.783 --> 16:53.049
I went on a little road trip to Maine,

16:53.085 --> 16:57.020
and I brought back... traveling gifts.

16:57.055 --> 16:59.856
- [Laughter] That's for you.
- Thanks.

16:59.892 --> 17:01.925
Nice. Oh, that is so you.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.095
And this little fella is for you.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.864
- Oh.
- I was in this cute little lobster shack

17:07.900 --> 17:09.065
on the wharf in Kennebunkport,

17:09.101 --> 17:12.135
and I ordered the special,
and the waiter pointed to the tank

17:12.171 --> 17:14.037
and told me I had to pick my lobster.

17:14.071 --> 17:16.772
And I just took one look at
this guy, and look at him.

17:16.809 --> 17:18.541
He looks just like you.

17:20.579 --> 17:21.978
What are you talking about?
It's a lobster.

17:22.013 --> 17:25.515
- That could be your twin.
- You are crazy.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.050
Look at his eyebrows.
They look just like yours.

17:28.086 --> 17:29.519
Lobsters don't have eyebrows.

17:29.555 --> 17:31.788
Oh, my god!
It does look like you!

17:31.824 --> 17:33.623
Oh, give me a break. 
[Chuckles]

17:33.659 --> 17:35.226
And after I saw that
face, I couldn't just

17:35.227 --> 17:36.793
leave him there to
be eaten by strangers.

17:36.829 --> 17:39.396
- Then you keep him.
- I can't.

17:39.431 --> 17:41.097
[Groans]

17:41.133 --> 17:43.066
- Guess what I named him.
- What?

17:43.101 --> 17:47.070
- Trey.
- Frankie Jr. Jr. Jr.

17:47.105 --> 17:48.905
- Yes.
- [Laughs] No.

17:48.941 --> 17:50.904
- Yes!
- You have to take him home.

17:51.015 --> 17:53.418
He looks just like you,
and he has your name.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.457
[Sighs]

17:58.984 --> 18:00.150
[Snickers]

18:00.185 --> 18:01.451
Bye.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.817
I just couldn't believe
that she would leave

18:06.852 --> 18:08.318
without saying goodbye,

18:08.354 --> 18:10.454
but the police told
me they checked it out

18:10.489 --> 18:12.589
and said my sister
gave her notice at work.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.760
They gave me her resignation letter.
I brought it.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.862
Thank you.

18:21.667 --> 18:26.603
I guess she quit her job and
they moved out of their apartment.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.872
Police told me there
was no sign of foul play.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.775
Bet the police also told you that
going missing was not a crime.

18:31.810 --> 18:36.480
- Yeah.
- What else can you tell us about them?

18:36.515 --> 18:39.883
Oh, I-I brought pictures.
I thought you might like to see them.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.422
<i>They were free spirits.</i>

18:45.457 --> 18:48.225
My sister always talked
about moving away,

18:48.260 --> 18:49.960
living off the grid.

18:49.995 --> 18:53.530
I hope they just took off
to follow their dreams.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.900
What did her husband do for work?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.836
He was a handyman.
 He could work anywhere.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.773
Was there anything physically
distinctive about them?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.776
Scars, missing teeth, broken bones?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.344
No, not that I know of.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.932
Wait.
My brother-in-law broke his

19:11.933 --> 19:16.686
left leg just below the knee
in a bike accident a few years ago.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.626
Do you know what happened to them?

19:25.931 --> 19:30.334
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but we have discovered two bodies

19:30.369 --> 19:34.199
that could possibly be your
sister and your brother-in-law.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.568
We could use your help,
if you're up to it.

19:41.905 --> 19:43.814
Would you know their dentist?

19:43.849 --> 19:46.662
Dental records would
help us identify them.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.419
We had the same dentist.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.736
Dental records match for
James and Bonnie Leonard.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.305
[Rattling]

20:08.340 --> 20:09.840
What is that?

20:15.414 --> 20:18.014
Why is there a lobster in Jane's desk?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.851
- I'm playing a little joke on her.
- You're poking a beehive.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.452
Trust me. 
This is gonna be funny.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.054
- Trust me. You're gonna get stung.
- Not this time.

20:24.089 --> 20:28.692
Why would this time be any different?
[Chuckles]

20:31.363 --> 20:32.662
[Sighs]

20:32.698 --> 20:34.731
Uh, they definitely
look like free spirits.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.566
Just like her sister said.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.102
Nina just finished a complete
background investigation on them.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.938
- Anything interesting?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.341
<i>No debt, no arrests,
no criminal records.</i>

20:44.376 --> 20:45.909
What do the neighbors say about them?

20:45.944 --> 20:48.879
That they were a nice, ordinary
couple who kept to themselves.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.015
Of course they were.
What about a love affair gone wrong?

20:52.050 --> 20:56.386
- Nothing we've found is pointing to that.
- In every picture,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.789
Bonnie looks like the
hippie her sister described,

20:58.824 --> 21:02.092
and yet we find her buried in
an old housecoat and slippers

21:02.127 --> 21:05.929
<i>- that no woman her age would wear.
- Doesn't make any sense.</i>

21:05.964 --> 21:08.899
Well, let's think about what we know
that does make sense.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.769
Someone had access to the body farm.
They buried our couple there

21:12.805 --> 21:14.838
because they thought it was
someplace nobody would look.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.706
- And they were almost right.
- Where are we with the list

21:16.742 --> 21:18.041
of people that had access to the place?

21:18.076 --> 21:19.576
The professor finally
sent it over an hour ago.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.911
Nina's been running criminal records

21:20.946 --> 21:22.612
on everyone who's been
in and out of there.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.526
Good, because right now,
that feels like our only lead.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.057
[Door opens]

21:35.494 --> 21:38.462
Oh, hey. You're home.
I got pizza from Mario's.

21:38.497 --> 21:43.800
- I'm not hungry.
- Well, it's... sausage and onion.

21:43.836 --> 21:48.505
- Your favorite.
- Yeah. Maybe later.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.011
[Sighs]

21:55.047 --> 21:56.446
[Groans]

21:56.482 --> 21:57.948
Are you okay?

21:59.985 --> 22:05.622
- I hurt my ankle.
- Oh. How? What did you do?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.325
Oh, I'm sure Jane told
you about my skating.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.162
[Sighs]

22:12.197 --> 22:15.098
I don't know why she made
such a big deal about it.

22:15.133 --> 22:18.869
Well, I think she was just...
worried about you.

22:18.904 --> 22:21.238
What? 
That I would hurt myself?

22:23.842 --> 22:28.245
- Can I take a look at your ankle?
- [Sighs] If you have to.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.148
Hmm.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.986
Okay, hold on. I'm just
gonna move it a little.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.053
[Moans]

22:37.089 --> 22:39.456
- Does that hurt?
- Mm.

22:39.491 --> 22:42.592
- Well, it ... it looks like a sprain.
- Mm.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.028
[Sighs]
Yeah, I'll be all right.

22:45.063 --> 22:48.031
No, you need to stay off
your feet as much as possible.

22:48.066 --> 22:51.668
Honey, do me a favor. [Groans]
Don't tell Jane.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.538
I don't need her barking at me again.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.039
[Groans]

22:56.074 --> 22:59.301
You don't think she's gonna
notice you limping around?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.145
Fine. Tell her.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.147
[Groans]

23:07.119 --> 23:08.952
[Door opens]

23:14.911 --> 23:17.478
See, I was right.
I knew she'd get hurt.

23:17.514 --> 23:20.348
I don't think the issue is really
who's right and who's wrong.

23:20.383 --> 23:21.716
I agree. The issue is skating.

23:21.751 --> 23:23.885
It's something she shouldn't
be doing at her age.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.887
I think it's a little
more complex than that.

23:25.922 --> 23:29.290
Complex how?
[Sighs]

23:29.325 --> 23:32.493
Well, the depth of your feelings

23:32.529 --> 23:35.630

is a hot-button issue here,

23:35.665 --> 23:37.899
maybe just below the surface?

23:37.934 --> 23:40.568

- Maybe nothing.

Never nothing with you.
What's up, Chang?

Hey. We got the tox screen
back for Bonnie Leonard.

23:48.478 --> 23:52.413
- And I have a feeling she wasn't clean.
- Our victim had low levels

23:52.449 --> 23:54.382
of the tranquilizer
ketamine in her system.

23:54.417 --> 23:57.585
- Special K.
- This kind of low dose

23:57.620 --> 24:01.556
would allow the victim to function,
but be easily controlled.

24:01.591 --> 24:03.458
And would play into how she was killed.

24:03.493 --> 24:05.426
It would also explain why the hanging

24:05.462 --> 24:09.341
looked more like a suicide
than a violent murder at first.

24:09.966 --> 24:13.004

the husband in the head,

And we found a former grad student

24:33.790 --> 24:35.423

for locking up at night.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.925
About a year ago, he was at
the body farm late one night

24:37.961 --> 24:39.427

24:39.462 --> 24:41.329
And then he runs into Professor Carlson,

24:41.364 --> 24:44.298
who was all dirty and agitated, right?

Carlson yells at the guy, tells
him to get out, the place is closed.

Right around the time the
husband's body goes into the ground.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.639

like being cooperative.

cooperative on our turf.

Mm-hmm.

25:59.042 --> 26:02.777
- I was there.
- Ah. Doing what?

26:02.812 --> 26:07.648
I'd been hired by the university
to take over the body farm,

26:07.684 --> 26:10.585
clean up the operation,
and I was making my rounds.

26:10.620 --> 26:13.772
And I discovered fresh
dirt and what looked like

26:13.773 --> 26:16.924
a set of wheel marks leading
away from a burial site.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.794
I thought someone had removed
one of the research corpses,

26:19.829 --> 26:21.662
hauled the body off with the dolly.

26:21.698 --> 26:23.531
I figured it was a... college prank

26:23.566 --> 26:25.967
or, you know, maybe
some sort of fraternity hazing.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.469
Our witness said you
were agitated and dirty.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.904
Well, of course I was agitated.

26:29.939 --> 26:33.007
I-I was brought here to make sure
things like this didn't happen.

26:33.042 --> 26:35.042
That doesn't explain why
you were covered with dirt.

26:35.078 --> 26:37.478
I was looking around to see where
the body had been taken from.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.614
And you didn't explain any
of this to the university?

26:39.649 --> 26:41.115
No. There's no reason to.

26:41.150 --> 26:44.185
And I confirmed that all
the bodies were present

didn't matter.

26:48.791 --> 26:51.626
Okay.
So, what you're telling us

happened that night

26:54.097 --> 26:56.697
is someone else buried a murder victim

26:56.733 --> 26:58.899

Yes.

- It's important.

- Not for now. You can go.

Why did you ask him about the
first four days of last month?

27:42.879 --> 27:44.745
Because Bonnie's body was buried

27:44.781 --> 27:47.648
within four days of the
garbage being spread around.

- So, what are you gonna do?
- I had to pull the plug on the prank.

28:10.572 --> 28:12.839
If I'd left him there any
longer, he would have died.

- Nope.

He's got this big saltwater aquarium.
At least Susie will be happy.

28:42.938 --> 28:46.106
about the length of
time Bonnie was buried?

28:46.141 --> 28:48.575
Well, uh, given the
state of decomposition,

28:48.610 --> 28:51.712
ground temperature, weather
conditions, I can say with

28:51.713 --> 28:54.814
certainty that the body was in
the ground for over 30 days. Why?

28:54.850 --> 28:58.443

28:59.521 --> 29:00.820

Why kill her after

29:02.658 --> 29:05.558
You know, there's a complex
psychological element

29:05.594 --> 29:08.412
At play here.
The housecoat and slippers

29:08.413 --> 29:11.631
feel like part of a fantasy,
probably related to domestic life.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.800
I suspect that Bonnie broke the fantasy.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.803
She does something that upsets him,
he snaps and hangs her.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.538
It's clearly psychopathic behavior.

29:18.573 --> 29:20.640
And since we can't find
any similar cases in VICAP,

29:20.676 --> 29:22.842
it's possible that this
was his first attempt

29:22.878 --> 29:25.612
to fulfill his twisted fantasy, 
and it went wrong.

29:25.647 --> 29:28.853
He killed this woman five weeks ago.

29:29.618 --> 29:31.785
Which means that he
is probably out there

29:31.820 --> 29:37.025

- Or he's already found her.

Have you found anything on this guy?

34:09.132 --> 34:11.565
Well, Jeffrey Tyler has
a long history of mental illness.

34:11.601 --> 34:13.435
Oh, who would have guessed that?

34:13.469 --> 34:16.438
<i>He was hospitalized several times
as a teenager for depression.</i>

34:16.473 --> 34:18.440
And his criminal
record lists two arrests

34:18.475 --> 34:20.309
for assault and battery of two women.

34:20.344 --> 34:22.444
Did you find any address
other than this apartment?

34:22.478 --> 34:25.614
- Just his parents' old address.
- But they haven't been there for years.

34:25.649 --> 34:27.215
His mother was murdered in 1978.

34:27.251 --> 34:28.650
<i>Hanged by his father.</i>

34:28.686 --> 34:30.786
Apple doesn't fall far
from the freak tree.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.822
His dad did 36 years in prison
and died there last year.

34:33.857 --> 34:35.690
And that could have been
the triggering incident

34:35.726 --> 34:37.192
for his abduction/murder spree.

34:37.226 --> 34:39.261
<i>I looked over the trial transcripts.</i>

34:39.295 --> 34:42.097
<i>The father was consumed
with controlling the mother.</i>

34:42.132 --> 34:44.110
She disobeyed him, he killed her.

34:44.146 --> 34:45.367
<i>Jane: Alright. 
What about friends,</i>

34:45.402 --> 34:47.803
relatives, any place that he
could be holding these women?

34:47.838 --> 34:50.405
No living relatives.
The guy was a loner.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.206
It seems he didn't
play nice with others.

34:52.242 --> 34:53.574
There's got to be something!

34:53.610 --> 34:56.089
Wait a minute.
What about the family home?

34:59.149 --> 35:00.816
[Beeps]

35:00.851 --> 35:04.152
The deed says it's still owned by
Jeffery's mother and father.

35:04.188 --> 35:07.422
We're gonna need that address.
[Cellphone beeps]

35:15.023 --> 35:18.124
[Breathing shakily]

35:18.159 --> 35:21.895
[Crying]

35:41.816 --> 35:43.755
[Crying continues]
[Window rattles]

35:50.792 --> 35:53.026
[Door opens]

35:57.532 --> 36:01.601
- I warned you not to go near that door.
- I wasn't.

36:03.905 --> 36:06.806
I go out for 10 minutes
to get us a nice bottle of wine,

36:06.841 --> 36:08.655
and this is what you do?

36:10.779 --> 36:12.745
[Slurring] I'm sorry.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.712
Where's my dinner?

36:23.158 --> 36:24.958
I'll get it.

36:24.993 --> 36:28.061
When I say I want my
dinner on the table,

36:28.096 --> 36:32.303
- [yelling] it damn well better be there!
- No. [Sobbing]

36:34.523 --> 36:37.804
I'll teach you to obey me!
[Screaming]

36:38.974 --> 36:41.708
Police!
Put the knife down!

36:41.743 --> 36:43.676
You drop it or I'll cut her!

36:43.712 --> 36:46.468
Put it down! Put it down!
[Gunshot]

36:46.581 --> 36:49.336
Aah!
[Groans]

36:49.985 --> 36:51.284
You won't be cutting anybody.

36:51.319 --> 36:53.620
- God!
- Get your hands behind your back.

36:53.655 --> 36:56.689
It's okay. It's all right.

36:56.725 --> 36:59.726
- It's all your fault!
- Let's go.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.260
Go!
[Crying]

37:01.296 --> 37:03.997
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

37:06.601 --> 37:08.701
<i>Shh. It's okay.</i>

37:18.813 --> 37:23.182
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey.

37:23.218 --> 37:27.687
I, uh, just wanted to tell
you I got a movie for tonight.

37:29.157 --> 37:30.256
I'm going out.

37:31.693 --> 37:34.127
- I figured.
- To the ice rink.

37:34.162 --> 37:38.631
Anything more you
want to say about that?

37:39.934 --> 37:42.702
Just that...

37:42.737 --> 37:46.372
I'm sorry for giving you
problems about skating.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.776
It's not my place to tell
you what you should do.

37:51.946 --> 37:55.415
- Thank you for saying that.
- You're welcome.

37:58.053 --> 38:03.022
Well, and thank you for
caring about your mom.

38:03.058 --> 38:05.291
<i>'Cause you were right.</i>

38:05.326 --> 38:09.162
I shouldn't be skating at this age.

38:09.197 --> 38:14.100
- [Mumbling] Or at any age.
- Okay, watch it.

38:14.135 --> 38:16.769
And, Ma, there are a lot of things

38:16.805 --> 38:21.174
that are wonderful about you.
Athletics ... not one of them.

38:21.209 --> 38:23.976
[Chuckles] I don't even
like being on the ice.

38:24.012 --> 38:27.780
- Well, what are you doing it for?
- I met someone.

38:27.816 --> 38:31.150
- Ma!
- And he really likes hockey and skating,

38:31.186 --> 38:35.088
and I-I... I just wanted
to be a part of his world.

38:35.123 --> 38:39.158
I never got to do any of
those things with your dad, and...

38:39.194 --> 38:41.227
I want to do them now!

38:41.262 --> 38:44.931
- Why didn't you just tell me this?
- I don't know.

38:44.966 --> 38:47.734
Probably wouldn't have
made a difference anyway.

38:47.769 --> 38:51.938
- Okay, what is that supposed to mean?
- We... [Sighs]

38:51.973 --> 38:54.173
I don't know. I just...
I've been thinking,

38:54.209 --> 38:57.744
and you know, I don't think
that I was upset with you

38:57.779 --> 39:01.314
because you were skating.
I think I was upset

39:01.349 --> 39:05.051
because you were skating
without me.

39:05.086 --> 39:07.954
[Chuckles] You want to
go ice skating with me?

39:07.989 --> 39:11.057
Yes! [Chuckles]
I have since I was a little girl.

39:14.763 --> 39:19.966
Yeah, but, uh...
there was never any time, was there?

39:21.970 --> 39:26.873
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Ma. It's okay.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.877
- Well...
- Yeah, you got to go.

39:30.912 --> 39:32.645
I love you.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.019
[Shakin' voice]
I want you to be happy, Jane.

39:40.054 --> 39:42.755
<i>I want you to be happy, too, Ma.</i>

39:42.791 --> 39:44.926
I know.
[Smooches]

39:46.394 --> 39:49.695
Don't stay out too late, young lady!
[Laughs]

39:49.731 --> 39:52.222
Don't wait up!

40:01.743 --> 40:02.842
Hello!

40:02.877 --> 40:06.012
- Hey. Where have you been?
- The Dirty Robber.

40:06.047 --> 40:08.714
Ah. Have you been drinking?

40:08.750 --> 40:11.851
No, I have been doing some
mother/daughter bonding.

40:11.886 --> 40:14.020
Oh, I'm sorry I missed it. 
I love bonding.

40:14.055 --> 40:16.422
Well, I'm sure we will bond some more.

40:16.457 --> 40:22.295
I did get us an action movie with 
emotional resonance.

40:22.330 --> 40:23.996
"Thelma & Louise!"

40:24.032 --> 40:26.999
Oh.
But this isn't an action movie.

40:27.035 --> 40:29.735
- It's a chick flick.
- Uh, agree to disagree.

40:31.005 --> 40:32.872
"This film is a celebration

40:32.907 --> 40:35.875
of two uniquely powerful
women fulfilling their destiny

40:35.910 --> 40:38.911
and bound together for eternity."
I'd call that a chick flick.

40:38.947 --> 40:40.479
What? Let me see that.

40:40.515 --> 40:44.884
No. "This film is a celebration
of two bad-ass chicks

40:44.919 --> 40:47.987
who drive their car over a cliff."
Action flick.

40:48.022 --> 40:49.501
[Chuckles]
Fair enough.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.159
But you know, we have
something in common

40:53.194 --> 40:56.095
- with Thelma and Louise.
- Oh? How so?

40:56.130 --> 40:58.264
Well, we're both unique individuals,

40:58.299 --> 41:00.833
and yet we have found
a common connection.

41:00.869 --> 41:03.035
Okay, yeah. I'll buy that.

41:03.071 --> 41:06.339
Yeah.
Like yin and yang.

41:06.374 --> 41:09.842
"Yin and yang?"
Which one am I?

41:09.878 --> 41:12.912
Oh, well, you're yin, of course ...
shady and cool.

41:13.948 --> 41:16.016
- No, I want to be yang.
- Nope. That's me.

41:16.017 --> 41:16.849
Sunny and bright.

41:16.885 --> 41:19.452
Well, how come you always
get to be the sunny one?

41:19.487 --> 41:21.988
[Chuckles]
Because of attitude like that.

41:22.023 --> 41:23.923
Well, I was gonna tell
you something about my mom

41:23.958 --> 41:26.959
and taking your advice, but no.
Now I'm not going to because

41:26.995 --> 41:29.795
my attitude is so dark
and shady and childish.

41:29.831 --> 41:30.563
- Jane...
- No.

41:30.598 --> 41:31.464
- Please.
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.499 --> 41:33.499
- I didn't say childish.
- Your eyes did.

41:33.534 --> 41:36.969
- Oh, come on!
- Mm, it's so good, too. [Laughs]

41:37.005 --> 41:39.125
- Come on.
- Nope.
