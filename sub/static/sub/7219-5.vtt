00:01.802 --> 00:03.806
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.871 --> 00:05.350
I need to check you for a wire.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.350
- Won't find one.
- Still need to check.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.818
In my dealings with the late,
great Sammy Tonin,

00:09.877 --> 00:12.016
he told me
that he had a lawman in Kentucky.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.524
If you want the full story,
you have to talk to Picker.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.889
- Picker?
- He's laying low

00:15.983 --> 00:18.987
in your neck of the woods
with a man named Wynn Duffy.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.496
Yet here I am,

00:20.554 --> 00:24.502
with a mandate to remove
the minor Kendal Crowe into state's custody.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.070
You ain't taking my baby brother.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.160
- I'll go.
- Kendal, you ain't going...

00:27.227 --> 00:28.365
No, Darryl.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.166
Ain't up to me' but I say we go.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.570
Disrobe and bend over.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.872
You disrobe and bend over.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.812
- We good?
- Stop resisting.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.547
She's protected, you stupid shit.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.481
Never again. Understand?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.716
Never again. Never again.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.051
Now, the money I offered Paxton,

00:46.146 --> 00:47.716
how about that ends up
under your mattress?

00:47.814 --> 00:48.918
In exchange for what?

00:49.016 --> 00:51.428
Telling him you put
a bullet in the back of my head.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.054
What's this skin?

00:53.153 --> 00:54.257
You think he's gonna turn up?

00:54.354 --> 00:56.061
Nah. He's gone.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.667
This is it?

00:57.925 --> 01:00.235
Three from the night
you and Jimmy almost got hit.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.534
Rest from the night they hit the shipment.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.603
Hello?

01:10.203 --> 01:11.682
Lee, I'm sorry to wake you.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.217
Well, as late as it is,

01:13.273 --> 01:15.549
there better be
a meteor heading towards Kentucky.

01:15.709 --> 01:20.681
Mr Paxton, Lee,
a phone call came in earlier tonight.

01:20.747 --> 01:25.423
It was an anonymous tip.
Led us to a pretty gruesome discovery.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.763
We... Yeah, I am very groggy.
Could you just please get on with it.

01:29.856 --> 01:30.891
<i>Well, okay.</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:33.870
I've got a bunch of dead bodies
that I'm looking at here,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.804
and I'm not exactly sure
what to make of them.

01:35.896 --> 01:36.931
What are you talking about?

01:37.431 --> 01:40.412
I mean corpses. Dead persons.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.311
Stashed away in one of your funeral homes
on Orchard Road.

01:43.704 --> 01:48.881
Prison tats, gunshots, blunt force.
It's murder victims near as I can tell.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.080
Tagged and waiting for the oven.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.417
No, no. That's impossible.

01:51.478 --> 01:55.824
Well, see, the party that called in this tip
said that we would find this horror show

01:55.916 --> 01:58.487
because you made
a deal with a local criminal element.

01:58.585 --> 02:02.260
You son of a bitch.
You told me he was dead.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.136
Jesus.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.182
You looking for this?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.251
Disposing of murder victims for money?

02:27.447 --> 02:30.121
Well, that leaves
a bad taste in a Christian's mouth.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.988
Small town don't run
on a 24-hour news cycle.

02:33.086 --> 02:37.159
A small town never forgets.

02:38.759 --> 02:43.003
Now words gonna burn through these hills
and hollers like a wildfire.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.971
The people of Harlan County, rich and poor,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.709
will marvel at your debasement and venality.

02:50.470 --> 02:55.112
They will spit venom
when they speak your name.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.286
And they will take your suicide

02:58.545 --> 03:02.186
as the last act of a coward.

03:03.316 --> 03:08.561
Now your reputation is ruined,
your good word worthless,

03:09.389 --> 03:11.960
but death will not

03:12.292 --> 03:15.637
be the end of your suffering.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.469
For generations...

03:18.131 --> 03:19.633
...your children

03:19.800 --> 03:24.749
and your children's children
will have a mark against their name.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.417
And that will be your legacy.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.542
Mr Crowder...

04:14.621 --> 04:16.100
Excuse me.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.535
You dropped a maxim.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.271
No, I don't think I did.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.699
No, I'm sorry. Well, that's my mistake.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.306
Four days ago you were in the States.
You talked to the feds.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.217
Detroit Marshal's office.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.277
Catch and release.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.252
- You remember?
- Look...

04:37.544 --> 04:38.887
I don't want any trouble, okay, man?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.448
Al, listen to me, okay?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.825
What you told them, you tell me.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.461
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.554
My name's Eric.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.223
Jesus Christ!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.291
Come on!

04:52.425 --> 04:53.733
Okay, we're gonna do this again.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.300
What you told them, you tell me, okay?

04:56.396 --> 04:59.070
All I gave them was that
there was a federal who was on the airfield

04:59.132 --> 05:01.612
the night that they took out Nicky. That's it!

05:01.768 --> 05:02.974
What about Sammy?

05:03.069 --> 05:04.605
Sammy? Sammy's dead, man.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.445
Come on! And?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.914
Look, I told them if they wanted the guy
who killed Sammy,

05:09.976 --> 05:11.614
that the word was Kentucky.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.916
A name?

05:13.246 --> 05:14.850
I just told them what I heard.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.690
I said it was Picker. I told them it was Picker.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.092
Okay. Thanks.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.633
Jesus. You shot my hand.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.303
Yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.608
So contact Dade County office, circuit two,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.777
- as soon as you can.
- I will.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.511
Wendy, can't get a cocoa.

05:43.610 --> 05:47.854
And, if Miami
doesn't work out for some reason?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.484
Just let us know.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.151
Other than that, you're free to go.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.560
Ms Crowe, welcome 10 Kentucky.

05:53.653 --> 05:54.961
What's he doing here?

05:55.222 --> 05:59.534
Well, I got a courtesy call... Text.
I was in the shower, why I'm late.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.572
She's texting you my business?

06:01.661 --> 06:02.696
Our business,

06:02.796 --> 06:06.209
as she is the case officer
and I am the officer-officer.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.041
And to answer your first question,
I'm checking on the child's welfare.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.136
How you doing, Kendal?

06:10.237 --> 06:12.012
About to sell blood to get a cocoa.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.881
Other than that drama, he's fine.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.385
Can't I just have one thin dime?

06:15.475 --> 06:16.977
- No.
- Here you go.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.215
Please give that back.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.548
Not likely.

06:19.646 --> 06:23.423
Does your campaign of harassment
against my family know no limits?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.763
Well, I gave the boy 10 cents.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.525
No. You're messing with his head.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.863
You were the other night,
and you are again right now.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.733
I hardly think
that compares to being 14 years old,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.067
slinging beers to whores and johns.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.834
Please tell me he ain't going back there.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.070
Ms Crowe's taking her brother
back to Miami to live with her.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.011
Yes, and if there's nothing else,
I'm gonna get going. It's along drive.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.275
- Of course.
- No, Ms Crowe.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.577
I need to know something.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.117
Best version,

06:47.207 --> 06:51.747
you are the civilised white sheep
in a clutch of cons, killers, and lowlifes.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.949
That's the best version?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.184
Or you're a lackey

06:54.247 --> 06:57.694
for each and every dipshit brother of yours
that gets in legal trouble.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.764
Deputy, if you're trying to
draw me into battle,

07:00.854 --> 07:02.629
you've got the wrong Crowe.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.724
I have no interest in fighting you.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.863
It's your brother and his entourage
I want out of Kentucky.

07:07.928 --> 07:12.536
To that end, next you have a word,
tell him I'm gonna have his parole reinstated.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.944
And because this is America,

07:15.035 --> 07:19.108
I'm gonna file enough injunctions
that he gets to stay wherever he pleases,

07:19.205 --> 07:20.650
as long as he pleases.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.047
Come on, Kendal.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.957
Jesus! That machine
hooked up to the septic?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.048
Come on.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.461
Campaign of harassment?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.757
I think that's blowing it out of size.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.059
Which is not a "no".

07:34.120 --> 07:35.793
I wasn't kidding about lowlifes.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.836
Raylan, you have a problem with that family,
that's fine.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.996
You're pissed because
you can't prove they killed someone,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.573
that's fine, too.

07:42.762 --> 07:46.107
But using that kid in that fight
is nowhere near fine.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.437
I was trying to help the boy.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.069
Or were you trying to draw fire?

07:50.670 --> 07:54.083
You get some cocoa. It's delicious.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.680
<i>National Low Income Housing Coalition
issued a report,</i>

07:58.778 --> 08:04.160
<i>and they found that low-income households
can only afford $495 a month.</i>

08:05.085 --> 08:10.262
<i>Nationally, the average
two-bedroom apartment rents for $977.</i>

08:10.323 --> 08:13.497
<i>Now, the plight of homeless families
is not front-page news.</i>

08:13.593 --> 08:16.164
<i>There aren't
any crying TV talk-show hostesses</i>

08:16.262 --> 08:17.935
<i>interviewing homeless children.</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:20.501
<i>Poor homeless children
whose only wish is to have</i>

08:20.600 --> 08:25.208
<i>a home where they can
lay their heads down at night...</i>

08:25.305 --> 08:29.947
<i>...as they sleep on outdoor grates
on cold, rainy nights.</i>

08:33.980 --> 08:36.153
Hey, excuse me. Hold on one sec.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.389
I got a friend in Jesus.
I support youth baseball.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.020
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.363
No, I don't have a pitch.
I just have a question.

08:43.456 --> 08:47.871
Do you always wait in your car for an hour
before you go get your breakfast?

08:50.563 --> 08:51.735
Do I know you?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.139
I don't know you.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.640
I'm in town for the convention.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.713
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.411
Buddy, you're gonna
want to take your hand off of me.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.647
What business do you have in a diner?

09:03.977 --> 09:04.978
I don't know.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.821
I was gonna eat, stare off into space,
you know, the usual.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.358
I'll tell you what I'd like to see.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.225
My cock? Sorry, princess.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.588
Your phone.

09:13.653 --> 09:14.893
I'm gonna go now.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.559
- What? Back to the Hyatt?
- The Hilton.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.068
After a bite.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.899
No, no, really, you don't want to do that.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.733
The food's no good here.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.367
There's a really great restaurant
in the hotel lobby.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.874
You're gonna stop me, you mean?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.382
We can make it official if you want.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.908
I could just arrest you on suspicion,
take a look at your jacket,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.352
find out where the home office is.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.513
You know what?

09:40.213 --> 09:45.026
I did take a glance at that menu.
The Hyatt is really classing things up lately.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.697
The Hilton.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.230
That's what I meant.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.568
One more thing.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.095
Smile.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.536
He wanted scrambled eggs,
so they brought him French toast.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.874
Wonderful.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.282
Could you bring me a cup of coffee
and some ice water, please?

10:08.374 --> 10:09.614
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.588
Hello, gentlemen.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.553
Who the hell is this?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.422
Marshal Givens' boss.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.960
Actually, there's only
one marshal in Kentucky, Mr Duffy.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.931
Raylan is a Deputy Marshal,
and I'm a Chief Deputy.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.559
Soto what do we owe the pleasure,
Chief Deputy Mullen?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.901
Well, see,
now you know my name and I know yours,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.635
but these two guys, what,
am I just gonna have to guess?

10:32.665 --> 10:36.772
I'll bet you're Mike.
I'll show you I did my homework.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.416
I know that you are his hairdresser.

10:40.006 --> 10:43.146
You got it, Pops.
Step outside, I'll give you a clip.

10:44.844 --> 10:49.315
Now, that means that you must be
Mr Picker, right?

10:50.016 --> 10:51.324
Ethan Picker.

10:53.319 --> 10:58.598
You have a rather noble profile, Mr Picker.
Is that due to your Greek heritage?

10:58.691 --> 11:01.297
I got my nose
from a surgeon in Beverly Hills.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.705
I just came to ask you,

11:03.796 --> 11:07.300
if you'd take a short walk with me,
talk in private.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.511
I'm quite enjoying my grapefruit juice.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.673
The man really is
enjoying his grapefruit juice,

11:11.771 --> 11:17.687
so if you have no law-enforcement reasons
to further harass us, have a good day.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.317
Harass?

11:19.779 --> 11:21.622
I thought I was being rather genial.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.822
I could be a lot less so.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.793
But just between us chickens,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.525
I'm not here on official business.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.655
Is that a fact?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.860
If I were,
I'd be compelled to ask Mr Picker here

11:30.957 --> 11:33.233
about the murder of Sammy Tonin.

11:33.660 --> 11:38.075
But that'd be official business,
and you know that's a whole thing.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.337
All I really want is a word.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.989
Ma'am, I want you to stay calm,

11:53.079 --> 11:55.150
but as quickly as you can,

11:55.215 --> 11:58.594
remove the people
from this restaurant, all right?

12:06.492 --> 12:07.994
Changed your mind.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.734
It's more interesting, isn't it?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.235
Lift your arms.
I'm gonna search you for weapons.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.836
I've got an FN .45 and a Walther.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.346
That's how you want to play it, huh?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.549
You know why I'm here.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.919
'Cause you're a boot-licking errand boy?

12:25.678 --> 12:29.125
You talk to me like that
because you know I'm not here to work.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.388
If I were, there wouldn't be talking.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.091
Hey, shit fingers, I see you.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.098
Everybody relax.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.190
Easy, Mikey.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.702
I'm just here to give the man a ride.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.203
I'm going for a walk with him.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.261
I'll wait.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.431
A long walk.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.371
You don't want to blow me off.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.136
Does anybody mind if I order?

12:51.804 --> 12:53.215
Your whole family.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.481
Come with me. Come on. Let's go.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.116
I can't let that happen.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.092
Then we're in a pickle.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.890
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds 10 leave,

13:06.953 --> 13:09.490
and then, I'm gonna shoot you.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.736
FYI, that's kind of a thing
with these marshals.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.139
You really think you're that good?

13:18.264 --> 13:22.940
I don't know. I'm getting old.
But I'm probably pretty good from this range.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.615
Well, we don't really need to
make the 6:00 news.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.924
Besides, a thing like this
has no expiration date.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.159
Let's go.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.499
I've changed my mind.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.971
Bullshit. I saved your ass.
You're coming with me.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.673
Take the walk, Mr Picker.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.708
We're not taking a walk.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.472
- Then what?
- Shut up.

13:59.639 --> 14:03.109
You spend your life thinking
you're one kind of person.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.653
You get up every day,

14:07.947 --> 14:11.019
put on clothes,
you run and do what needs doing,

14:12.485 --> 14:15.125
try to have fun somewheres in between.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.062
That's who you figure you are.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.407
All them things you done.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.305
And then one day...

14:31.304 --> 14:33.079
Shit.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.552
Shit what?

14:35.641 --> 14:39.384
Shit bullshit. I ain't the things I done.

14:39.479 --> 14:43.325
If I was, God damn,
I'd be one jacked-up whole piece of pussy.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.195
Hey, listen,
maybe you ain't just the things you done.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.859
All I'm saying is, you do a thing

14:50.757 --> 14:53.704
that you never done one day,

14:55.194 --> 14:59.267
shit changes and you change

14:59.499 --> 15:03.003
and things change
and everything's changing.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.104
Hell you talking about, Dewey?

15:04.203 --> 15:07.241
Is this 'cause
I stuck my finger up your butt last time?

15:07.340 --> 15:10.878
No, no. No, I'm just talking to y'all.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.752
- Talking?
- It's weird.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.882
Well, fine. To hell with it.

15:15.848 --> 15:20.228
Now, I come here anyways
'cause I got something for both of you.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.694
Now, I want you to have this, Mina.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.462
My pappaw gave it to me.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.866
It's a...

15:31.230 --> 15:35.144
It's a turtle dog. He carved it himself.

15:36.702 --> 15:40.548
And, Teena, this is, without doubt,

15:42.308 --> 15:44.982
my most prized possession.

15:47.213 --> 15:51.218
But I don't want nothing more
that come from Florida anyway anyhow.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.660
You want to swap?

16:09.402 --> 16:10.938
- Jimmy.
- Been a while.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.311
You want your usual?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.112
Yes, I do.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.077
Four fingers of Elmer T.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.617
That's a good, strong drink.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.423
One of my favourites.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.798
Most people too cheap to
pour a true double any more.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.864
That's what's wrong with this world,

16:30.957 --> 16:32.368
everybody's on the take.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.869
Yep.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.767
Well, I ain't the promoting type,

16:36.829 --> 16:41.209
but since you brought it up,
I got my own spot down the road.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.675
Pour with a heavy hand,
got that good music on the box,

16:46.772 --> 16:50.948
and a young, pretty staff that's real friendly.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.787
Well, I like friendly people.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.792
What's the name of your spot?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.727
Right now it's called Audry's.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.126
But that's going to change.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.832
Lots of things are gonna change.

17:04.991 --> 17:09.633
Well, I appreciate the invitation,
but I like it right here.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.732
My kind of place, I guess.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.207
To each his own.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.076
This Boyd Crowder's place, isn't it?

17:19.070 --> 17:20.709
Well, it's says Johnny's on the sign out front,

17:20.806 --> 17:23.582
but I do believe
Mr Crowder's the man in charge.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.520
I heard he's some big-time badass, huh?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.490
- Big time.
- That's what they say.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.384
I wouldn't tell from the
immediate surroundings, though.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.260
Looks like the shack
after skinning gators all summer.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.354
Yep.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.491
It smells like it, too.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.327
I'd keep my criticisms
to a whisper if I were you.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.262
Well, it's just us talking, right?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.930
What's this Crowder going to do?

17:43.029 --> 17:46.010
Well, an unpredictable man
can be unpredictable.

17:46.065 --> 17:50.514
Yeah, well, let's hope he's predictable
enough to show up at his own bar.

17:51.437 --> 17:55.044
You looking to have a
conversation with the man?

17:56.909 --> 18:00.083
Well, let me buy you another round
while you wait.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.388
Jimmy, can I get two more
for my new friends...

18:03.449 --> 18:06.089
I'm sorry, I didn't get your names.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.528
Darryl Crowe Jr.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.058
To new friends.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.464
Yeah. And how about you?

18:11.390 --> 18:12.869
My name's Boyd Crowder.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.230
God damn, man.

18:16.295 --> 18:17.797
That was cool as ice.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.935
I ain't gonna take your compliment
after taking your insult.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.916
Now, you got 60 seconds to say
what it is you been waiting to say.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.726
You sold my cousin Dewey
a bill of goods, didn't you?

18:47.760 --> 18:52.675
That whorehouse shithole
was a money loser with a bartender

18:52.765 --> 18:56.076
who not only had his hand in the till,

18:56.135 --> 18:59.639
but was cooperating
with the federal authorities.

19:00.272 --> 19:03.446
Well, it sounds to me like you got a
problem with its current management.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.681
15 seconds.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.484
Nah, man.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.921
My problem is with you, Boyd.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.995
Crowes want purchase price plus interest.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.096
And if I say no?

19:19.291 --> 19:22.170
It's funny,
I hadn't even considered you might say no.

19:22.595 --> 19:27.635
Well, you dumb-ass,
you might want to consider it.

19:29.301 --> 19:33.716
So we're clear, you are saying no?

19:34.206 --> 19:38.621
I've been accused of being a lot of things,
inarticulate ain't one of them.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.022
- Jimmy.
- That's $10 for the beer.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.355
Plus tip.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.165
Now get out of my goddamn bar.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.031
- Hey.
- I will.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.696
- Just the man I wanted to see.
- I bet.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.298
Okay. Remember I was down in Florida,
came back...

19:58.364 --> 19:59.365
I did.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.069
Looking to revoke parole for Darryl Crowe Jr.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.168
I do.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.406
Are you talking to me or them?

20:03.502 --> 20:04.981
- You. She put me on hold.
- Okay.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.406
I want to reinstate the terms of his parole,

20:07.506 --> 20:11.044
build a case with your help,
purge Kentucky of the Crowe family entire.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.383
I know. Can this wait?

20:12.478 --> 20:14.480
What?
- Well, look around, Raylan.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.486
Big fish in the tank.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.325
You want to talk purge' let's talk later.
I'm back.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.359
What were we talking about? All right.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.617
Mr Dunham.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.245
Boyd, how you doing, brother?

20:45.344 --> 20:46.687
I'm good.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.854
Brings me back being here.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.621
Used 10 be on this very spot

20:53.719 --> 20:55.630
was an old honky tonk
your daddy and I favoured.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.098
Yes, sir.

20:57.189 --> 21:01.365
They had an old Ludwig kit
with a calfskin bass head on the stage.

21:01.927 --> 21:06.205
Ever I come to town,
Bo and I'd sit down, get good and stoned,

21:06.866 --> 21:09.972
and play Guy Clark tunes or Ray Price.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.547
You know, when he got really frisky,
your daddy?! call out for Merle Travis.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.243
He loved that man. He idolised him.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.585
Could never play like him,
but Bo about wore them records out.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.791
So I guess you figured out the puzzle.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.056
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me
all the way up here.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.394
And my cousin Johnny, your new partner,

21:28.621 --> 21:31.124
acted without authorisation, made you think,

21:31.223 --> 21:34.727
"if that duplicitous son of a bitch
can betray his own blood,"

21:34.794 --> 21:36.796
"what might he do to me?"

21:36.896 --> 21:38.637
Else you wouldn't be here.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.736
I'm not here to talk about
the internal dynamics of my shit, Boyd.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.240
I'm hereto make reparations.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.080
I'm prepared to
give you 50 cents on the dollar.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.512
Well, that's a very generous offer.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.146
I know what it's worth
down to the decimal point.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.823
But to be blunt, I'm gonna reject your offer.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.354
Now, I have a counter

21:59.451 --> 22:02.660
that I think you will find
both painless and profitable,

22:02.755 --> 22:04.428
comparatively speaking.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.164
I'm listening hard.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.671
You pay me nothing.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.534
- I what?
- You apologise.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.538
You turn over my cousin Johnny

22:14.633 --> 22:16.670
and you agree right now

22:16.769 --> 22:19.113
to help me smuggle heroin
across the border from Mexico.

22:22.141 --> 22:27.215
The first two I'm gonna have to think about.
The last one ain't gonna happen.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.524
You want me to move

22:29.615 --> 22:33.859
from the low-risk,
high-reward weed business

22:33.953 --> 22:35.990
into the high-risk,

22:36.055 --> 22:39.867
high-mortality trade of black tar?

22:40.159 --> 22:44.164
Well, would it sweeten your tea
if I offered to cut you in down the line, 50/50?

22:44.630 --> 22:48.043
You'd really be willing to
give up half your take on the heroin?

22:48.467 --> 22:52.540
Compared to what I'm gaining,
I ain't giving up a thing.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.010
Explains why Art went to Detroit.

22:57.343 --> 23:00.324
- Art went to Detroit?
- About a week ago.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.390
Are you going in?

23:02.481 --> 23:04.859
Guys upstairs ID'd him.
This just jumped to the top of the pile.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.157
- I want in.
- Raylan.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.220
Guy in there set my ex-wife and me
up for murder.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.560
It's not about him any more.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.067
Of course it is. I'm going in.

23:15.427 --> 23:19.034
Well, your friend at the restaurant
is a high-value target at the DOJ.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.941
Name is Elias Marcos...

23:21.033 --> 23:24.412
Theo Tonin's consigliere
and one-man Praetorian guard.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.675
Went with him to Tunisia.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.278
I remember you.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.047
How you doing?

23:29.108 --> 23:31.554
My old high school. Big showdown.

23:32.544 --> 23:33.545
That was a gas, wasn't it?

23:34.179 --> 23:37.217
Mr Picker,
we'd like your help finding Marcos.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.786
Him in the world represents
a disruption in the force.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.263
Now, we know that Theo Tonin
left Tunisia two days ago

23:42.354 --> 23:43.594
looking for help with his heart ailment.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.230
We just don't know where.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.969
Hopefully some country
with friendly extradition laws.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.740
And what makes you think
I'm gonna help you find my ex-boss?

23:52.031 --> 23:55.069
I don't know. You shot his son.
Maybe he sent his top guy to whack you.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.211
I killed Sammy? That's funny.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.943
We got multiple sources
put you as the trigger man.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.076
Sources? No witnesses?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.756
Please. I'm not some rookie corner boy
you can scare into copping.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.883
Well, it's just a matter of time and pressure
before there's a sworn statement.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.990
You guys just love
the smell of your own farts, don't you?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.924
Well, this has got to be
why Marcos didn't just pop him.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.796
Probably wanted to
take him out in the countryside

24:16.889 --> 24:19.597
and get some pliers and a blowtorch
and work him over a little bit,

24:19.725 --> 24:21.796
maybe send Theo a little snapshot.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.966
That or he didn't want to
shoot it outwith four armed men.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.134
Genius.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.806
Just give me two minutes.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.807
Be my guest.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.143
Alone.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.743
I'm gonna have a Diet 7UP.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.289
I'll have one, too, princess.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.455
You can suck the can when I'm done.

24:41.513 --> 24:42.992
I look forward to it.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.926
Fear of black lung's
why I got out of the mines,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.468
joined the service.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.300
You was smart. I thought I was smart.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.869
Thought I would dodge it.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.975
But here I am.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.277
The world is full of empty promises, Hayes.

25:07.539 --> 25:08.813
I'm worried, Boyd.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.849
Well, now, this...

25:14.613 --> 25:16.957
...is a promise you can take to the bank.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.722
Not that.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.795
Not that. I know you're solid.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.961
It's just the thought
of never seeing my kids again.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.134
My wife.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.671
You just got to
love them hard on your last days,

25:36.235 --> 25:38.215
in your last minutes.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.146
Yeah.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.416
They don't monitor this room, you know.

25:46.678 --> 25:49.750
You want a proper interrogation,
you got to go down the hall.

25:49.848 --> 25:53.523
Well, if you're gonna use a rubber hose,
you might want to close the blinds first.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.189
I know why you want to leave.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.826
You want to take out Marcos yourself,

25:57.890 --> 26:00.700
meaning you got a good idea
where to find him.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.000
So give me an address.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.237
Or what?

26:06.331 --> 26:08.402
All I'm asking is you cooperate.

26:10.369 --> 26:14.749
You want to threaten me.
I can see it on your face.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.583
We've met once or twice.
Doesn't mean you know me or my thoughts.

26:18.677 --> 26:22.181
Tell you one thing.
Don't threaten a guy who can blackmail you.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.851
Careful what you say now.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.355
Well, I thought you said
they didn't roll tape in this room.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.955
That's not what I mean.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.370
I want you to think about something.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.770
The reason
you're in a position to blackmail me

26:36.862 --> 26:38.773
is because of things I do...

26:38.864 --> 26:41.105
Things you've witnessed me do.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.636
So that's the threat.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.546
That's simply a statement of fact.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.886
What's it gonna be?

26:53.378 --> 26:55.119
Just relax, Mooney.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.785
Everybody knows
what kind of man you really are.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.159
That didn't stop LBJ from getting elected.

27:00.719 --> 27:04.724
It's just that I eat in here every day.
Less the big deal we make it, the better.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.062
So give me my money.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.470
You ought to enjoy life a little.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.276
And speaking of which,
I enjoyed your statement.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.837
That's pretty funny,
you look at it a certain way.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.312
Funny? It's word for word.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.280
I stated in Paxton's last phone call

27:20.339 --> 27:23.582
that he confessed to
his criminal corpse conspiracy.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.183
Now, that right there...
Now, if I have to spell out why that's funny...

27:29.414 --> 27:31.951
Maybe you're not so amused
as you are in a good mood.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.660
Well, maybe you're right.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.356
After everything
my fiancée and I have been through,

27:37.456 --> 27:41.268
I got to say, today,
lam in a pretty good mood.

27:43.262 --> 27:46.869
I'm gonna use the bathroom
and get you what you got coming to you.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.536
Good.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.648
Maybe we should get something to eat
so it looks less suspicious.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.450
Sheriff Mooney.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.859
This is what you get
when you cross my family.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.319
That was Hayes' workman.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.317
He's got the black lung.
He ain't long for this world.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.387
Won't even see a trial.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.725
But in six months' time,

28:39.818 --> 28:42.662
his wife and his boys
will have enough money

28:42.721 --> 28:44.758
to give them a leg up in this life.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.838
The money that's supposed to be mine.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.898
Every last dollar.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.567
So I get nothing?

28:53.932 --> 28:55.912
While I don't have any money
for you, Mrs Paxton,

28:56.001 --> 28:59.710
no, you don't walk away with nothing.

29:04.209 --> 29:09.386
Now, you leave Harlan County
and you don't come back.

29:25.364 --> 29:29.107
The dominoes have fallen, to coin a phrase.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.944
The suicide of Lee Paxton,
the murder of Mooney,

29:33.038 --> 29:35.143
have made a shambles of this case.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.413
Judge Bishop is ready to dismiss.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.547
Now, the bottom line is,

29:39.745 --> 29:43.215
we're gonna get you out-processed
first thing in the morning.

29:43.882 --> 29:47.557
You're gonna be home, a free woman,
by 9:00 or 10:00 a.m.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.492
- Could you give us a minute?
Absolutely.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.904
Hey...

29:58.063 --> 30:02.341
First thing I get out tomorrow morning,
you take me out to eat?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.846
You want a cat head or a tenderloin biscuit?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.083
Scattered, smothered, and covered.

30:07.606 --> 30:10.109
God damn, I have missed you so much.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.820
I want to fall asleep in your arms
and wake up in your arms

30:13.912 --> 30:17.758
and hold you forever in our house.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.121
Alone.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.323
Quiet.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.672
Thank you.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.216
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.217
I'll be here at 8:59.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.494
Look who's here.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.469
Old Wendy.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.878
Here you go. You're welcome.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.540
So, this is your big plan, huh?

31:13.705 --> 31:14.911
You don't like?

31:15.006 --> 31:16.542
No, it's not too bad

31:16.641 --> 31:19.588
if you like the smell of cheap beer
and stale cum.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.055
No wonder they drug him out of here.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.819
That marshal ain't have no right...

31:22.881 --> 31:25.225
No, he had every right, and I don't blame him.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.093
That kid's sleeping on couches
all Swiss cheesed...

31:28.186 --> 31:31.429
Hurricane Wendy
all the way from the Gulf Coast!

31:31.523 --> 31:33.503
How the hell did you stay
in the car with her for four hours?

31:34.526 --> 31:35.834
Look at that shirt.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.834
It's real pretty.
Your foster family give you that?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.543
Bet you a dollar it's from J.C. Penney.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.010
- Let me see the tag.
- Quit it.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.406
I said let me see the tag.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.446
Leave me alone!

31:44.536 --> 31:45.606
- Danny, cut it out, man!
- Come on.

31:45.704 --> 31:46.705
Leave me alone, man.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.217
It's like herding cats with them, man.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.844
I ain't never had the patience to
deal with that shit like you.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.217
You wanted this, didn't you?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.623
What?

31:57.382 --> 31:59.521
You crafty little turd.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.758
You wanted me to come up here,
read you the Riot Act,

32:02.854 --> 32:04.765
and get your sorry asses in gear, didn't you?

32:04.856 --> 32:06.767
We are better off with you than without you.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.361
No, no, no. Not this time. lam leaving.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.772
Well, I ain't. I ain't going nowhere.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.707
All right? We setting down roots.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.403
- Is that so?
- That's so.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.038
Yeah?
Well, let me tell you a little something.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.610
That marshal's looking to
reinstate your parole,

32:20.705 --> 32:23.413
so best-case scenario,
you are in Kentucky for three weeks.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.250
Nah, you need to do better than that.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.290
All right? You need to shut him down.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.449
Lawyer his ass.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.289
Darryl, believe me,
I will do the very best I can.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.953
This family needs to stay together.

32:33.051 --> 32:36.726
To wit, you need to find
a fit place for that boy to lay his head.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.894
You have any ideas or you want them to
just take him away again?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.802
No and no. But I ain't got no money just yet.

32:42.894 --> 32:43.838
No, of course you don't.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.101
The money will come, Wendy.

32:45.230 --> 32:48.507
Well, until it does,
you have got to find a house.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.079
So, what, you ain't got no ideas?

32:50.335 --> 32:51.780
Don't be cute with me.

32:51.837 --> 32:53.441
Come on.
You're supposed to be the smart one.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.919
Well, you could do the old thing.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.423
We could do the old thing.

33:10.589 --> 33:14.162
- The old thing works.
- The old thing works good.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.129
Well, I don't have X-ray vision,

33:18.196 --> 33:21.200
but I don't think there's a hidden
compartment in any of these trucks.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.343
You think Picker was jerking us around?

33:29.474 --> 33:32.455
Or Marcos was already gone
by the time we got here.

33:39.117 --> 33:42.860
Why were you looking for Picker?
Tim and Rachel said you went to Detroit?

33:52.297 --> 33:54.573
Unless he's been here the whole time.

34:31.436 --> 34:32.540
We're clear?

34:33.170 --> 34:34.342
Clear!

34:38.909 --> 34:40.719
Holy Lord, that gun was bad.

34:41.446 --> 34:45.121
Damn. Look at that thing.
Did you see that thing?

34:45.216 --> 34:47.196
Darn, no, I must have missed it.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.362
Speaking of which, you might want to
log in a few hours at the range.

34:50.554 --> 34:51.625
Shit, though.

34:53.190 --> 34:56.638
That's our link to Theo Tonin,
dead and gone.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.776
I've admired it
ever since the day you showed up.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.209
It's like corn silk.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.580
You got nice hair, too.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.709
Please. It's tangled and fit for rats.

35:09.307 --> 35:14.222
I blame my daddy...
Italian blood, hair all thick and greasy.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.383
It's been murder my whole life.

35:17.148 --> 35:21.221
You get out, need work,
check out the salon in Corbin.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.232
Tell them I told you to stop by.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.797
I ain't getting out anytime soon.
But I appreciate it just the same.

35:30.996 --> 35:32.134
Bed check.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.607
It ain't Toss Tuesday.

35:34.099 --> 35:37.012
Yeah, well,
Barbie getting discharged tomorrow,

35:37.102 --> 35:38.172
or didn't you hear?

35:38.269 --> 35:39.339
I heard.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.815
Then lock the lip down
unless you want a report.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.409
You're just mad someone out your knot.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.524
Holy shit, girl.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.160
You got a banger up in here?

36:01.259 --> 36:04.763
No. You put that there. That ain't mine.

36:05.096 --> 36:08.270
What were you fixing to do, huh?
Hurt somebody?

36:08.333 --> 36:09.334
No.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.970
Your cellie?

36:11.636 --> 36:12.671
Me?

36:12.771 --> 36:13.715
No.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.046
Hey, come on.

36:16.141 --> 36:17.279
Wait.

36:18.443 --> 36:21.117
You know
what kind of deep shit you'd be in...

36:22.213 --> 36:23.692
...if you did...

36:24.449 --> 36:25.553
This?

36:27.786 --> 36:28.821
And this?

36:32.791 --> 36:34.293
Oh, my God.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.668
Bye-bye, honey.

36:39.497 --> 36:40.567
Sorry, Ava.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.305
Like I said, I ain't getting out no time soon.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.143
Man down. Help.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.978
- Help.
- She shanked the guard!

36:47.038 --> 36:49.314
- Ava shanked the guard!
- Man down.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.230
Gentlemen...

37:12.197 --> 37:13.870
You should see this.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.085
Hello, Theo.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.425
But that face...

37:40.525 --> 37:43.369
I bet that's the same look
Saddam had coming out the spider hole.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.204
Man was gonna fly 10 to 12 hours in a can.

37:46.297 --> 37:47.799
Can you imagine?

37:47.899 --> 37:49.310
He had nice pillows.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.579
What, he's still on the phone?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.111
What, is he talking to Holder now?

37:54.205 --> 37:57.209
He's done with Holder.
What's the deal on Picker?

37:57.575 --> 37:59.111
Well, he seemed genuinely flattered

37:59.210 --> 38:01.986
that Theo came out of hiding to
personally execute him.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.617
Otherwise, nothing to keep him on,
so we let him go.

38:05.049 --> 38:07.655
Man, you are sending him
off in grand fashion, huh?

38:07.752 --> 38:09.060
What's he got left? Eight months?

38:09.454 --> 38:11.331
Theo goddamn Tonin.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.836
If that isn't the cap to a guy's career,
I don't know what is.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.968
Ain't you supposed to be getting groceries?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.803
Wendy told you.

38:23.067 --> 38:26.344
Ain't nobody listen to me,
so I ain't listening to them.

38:26.437 --> 38:27.472
Here we go.

38:27.572 --> 38:31.179
They didn't listen to me when I said,
"Kill the marshal."

38:31.910 --> 38:33.514
Now we all got this headache.

38:33.778 --> 38:34.916
He had a gun.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.783
Man, you're dumb.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.086
Just dumb.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.791
Take aim, boy.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.031
Like you got a gun.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.438
I'm gonna show you what can
and can't be done.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.439
How I would have done it.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.713
I know the 21-foot rule, okay?

38:59.270 --> 39:00.715
Yeah.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.482
You flinched.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.621
Yeah, I damn flinched.
Crazy asshole running at me with a knife.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.294
Get out of my face.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.793
What's this?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.303
Why nobody do nothing?

39:24.128 --> 39:25.300
Why you change your shirt?

39:26.631 --> 39:27.701
Hey.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.642
Why you change your shirt?

39:29.801 --> 39:30.836
It was itchy.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.811
You changed because of this one.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.475
No.

39:39.377 --> 39:43.325
Danny, Danny, Danny boy.
Where's the food?

39:44.015 --> 39:45.153
Food?

39:45.516 --> 39:47.689
Wendy has given you a list.
Did you get the food?

39:50.255 --> 39:52.997
Well, J.B., I... I guess I forgot.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.169
Yeah.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.369
So maybe you can go now.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.377
Yeah, well, I already got one bitch
trying to be my mama.

40:01.432 --> 40:03.378
I don't need two.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.682
Do you mean this when you call me "bitch"?

40:12.010 --> 40:15.514
It's just a word. Bitch.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.285
- It's just a word.
- Yeah.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.027
Now, see, I prefer sticks and stones

40:22.520 --> 40:24.363
'cause I like to break bones.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.735
That's not the way you
should be talking to me, homie.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.466
A man that just talks is no man.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.966
I'm warning you.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.877
If I want to fight you, Danny,
I just come at you.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.544
I give you 21 feet.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.878
I give you your best knife.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.552
Don't be ignorant.

40:47.078 --> 40:51.720
Have you done this really?
This 21-foot rule?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.827
Hell, yeah.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.061
Well, then, do it again.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.234
But give me a real gun.

40:59.757 --> 41:02.670
No bullshit. Let's do it.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.775
Not today.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.184
I got some groceries to pick up.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.321
Yes, you do.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.928
Kendal, where's that goddamn list?

41:26.417 --> 41:27.828
I ain't got it.

41:41.532 --> 41:42.943
Suck on that, bitch!

41:43.001 --> 41:44.446
My ears, Danny!

41:44.635 --> 41:47.047
You push me, and I teach you what's up!

41:49.173 --> 41:50.652
Oh, my God. He's...

41:50.708 --> 41:52.949
He's Haitian hamburgers what he is.

41:53.611 --> 41:54.783
You killed him.

41:57.782 --> 42:00.058
You ain't gonna lose your shit, are you?

42:00.151 --> 42:02.722
Ain't gonna tell nobody?

42:06.791 --> 42:07.963
Just say no.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.835
- I won't say a word.
- That's right.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.066
It's our little secret.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.976
Put that behind the bar.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.640
I got to get some plastic.

42:30.648 --> 42:32.423
Come on, man.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.997
- You're cleaning me out over here.
- Let's go. Let's go.

42:35.353 --> 42:36.525
Who's winning?

42:36.587 --> 42:37.691
Me.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.369
- Why do you let him play?
- That's what I'm saying.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.268
Equal opportunity, boss.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.738
- Yeah. Quota.
- That's right. Affirmative action.

42:44.829 --> 42:46.740
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. See.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.034
You can't.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.004
Okay. I got it. I got it.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.615
Need to interrupt real quick.

42:53.704 --> 42:56.742
I was just wondering
if you heard the news, Johnny.

42:56.874 --> 43:00.219
Well, being that you're the main newsman
around here, if you ain't told me, then no.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.785
Boyd's got another shipment coming in.

43:04.182 --> 43:06.093
Well, he lit that candle back up quick.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.025
Not Detroit.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.025
I got it on good authority

43:11.255 --> 43:14.759
he's striking up a connection
with the Mexicans.

43:15.193 --> 43:18.436
Mexicans? Damn, it's hard times.

43:20.064 --> 43:24.308
Well, I figure
that wind's being favourable lately.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.443
Maybe we double down
and we hit that shipment, too.

43:27.538 --> 43:28.573
There you go.

43:28.906 --> 43:31.944
Yeah, that is big-balls bold. I like it.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.556
I knew you would.

43:34.946 --> 43:38.257
One question, though.
You got this on good authority from who?

43:38.883 --> 43:40.328
Boyd.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.666
Game's over.

43:44.889 --> 43:46.334
I need you to come with.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.963
You and him out a deal?

43:51.896 --> 43:53.068
Sorry, son.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.583
Well, one more question before I go.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.682
How did you spend your take of our first hit?

44:08.146 --> 44:09.625
That's what you're asking me?

44:11.249 --> 44:12.819
I invested it.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.824
It's always best to
make your money work for you.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.598
That's funny. I did much the same.

44:21.792 --> 44:24.966
I didn't even take my cut. I split it three ways.

44:25.630 --> 44:28.702
People power. It's a pretty damn
good investment, don't you agree?

44:30.835 --> 44:32.178
Well, shit.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.779
Rye. Double.

44:38.776 --> 44:39.880
You're the lawyer.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.116
I am.

44:44.048 --> 44:45.652
Are you all right?

44:47.118 --> 44:48.153
Is Boyd in?

44:48.653 --> 44:49.825
Right behind you.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.133
Mr Geist!

44:53.057 --> 44:55.628
Bad news, Boyd. Bad news.

44:57.528 --> 45:00.008
Well, it can't be that bad.

45:02.633 --> 45:05.637
Jimmy, give this man
another round on the house.

45:06.637 --> 45:09.015
You're gonna want one yourself.

45:14.478 --> 45:16.981
Where is she? Where's Ava Crowder?

45:17.048 --> 45:18.049
You need to calm down, Boyd.

45:18.149 --> 45:21.062
Don't tell me to calm down, God damn it.

45:21.152 --> 45:24.156
I... Where's my fiancée?

45:24.755 --> 45:28.396
I just... I want to know where she is.

45:28.492 --> 45:30.563
I want to see my fiancée.

45:30.661 --> 45:33.335
She's gone.
Transferred to the State Penitentiary.

45:38.903 --> 45:43.181
Get off me! Get off me! Get off me!

45:46.010 --> 45:48.422
Not too many days like this one.

45:50.514 --> 45:53.586
Would it be selfish of me to
say that I don't want it to end?

45:53.684 --> 45:55.425
No, tonight you're entitled.

45:55.519 --> 45:57.726
Would you call it
the best day of your career?

45:58.789 --> 46:01.963
Backing that asshole down
in that diner this morning,

46:02.059 --> 46:03.595
Gunslinger Givens style.

46:04.195 --> 46:07.233
"I'm gonna give you 10 seconds
or I'm gonna shoot you."

46:10.368 --> 46:13.042
That's got me covered
for the next 10 fishing trips.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.947
Never say I didn't teach you nothing.

46:15.039 --> 46:16.143
The hell you say?

46:16.240 --> 46:19.050
Not literally. Like osmosis.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.387
Oh, boy. Start throwing
around the big words, that's my cue to go.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.221
Go look it up, you mean?

46:25.383 --> 46:26.919
Raylan, you're a dick.

46:26.984 --> 46:31.626
Art, you're an American hero. And it is
my honour to work in your company.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.429
I'm a dick, but you're a kiss-ass.

46:33.491 --> 46:34.993
Okay, I'm trying to toast the man, please.

46:35.092 --> 46:38.232
If I had to choose one person
who deserved this big a win,

46:38.796 --> 46:42.073
it'd be you, Chief. 100%. Congratulations.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.774
Well, that was lovely, sir.
You can kiss my ass anytime you like.

46:49.840 --> 46:56.086
By the way, in all the hoopla, I almost forgot,
Picker did volunteer one tidbit.

46:56.514 --> 47:00.485
You know, there's a rumour going around
that a federal lawman was instrumental

47:00.584 --> 47:02.325
in the death of Nicky Augustine.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.993
Picker said he was there on the tarmac,
watched the whole thing go down.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.296
No shit.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.768
Want to guess who he said it was?

47:15.933 --> 47:19.972
Our favourite FBI asshole,
Special Agent Barkley.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.512
Still missing, by the way.

47:22.606 --> 47:23.949
Can you imagine that?

47:24.809 --> 47:26.550
Barkley.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.055
That's crazy.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.700
Well, I guess I should go, too.

47:44.795 --> 47:46.797
Unless there's something else.

48:14.158 --> 48:19.107
It wasn't Barkley,
and I can tell you that for a fact.
