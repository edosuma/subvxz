00:03.003 --> 00:06.439
The prophets sing.
This is a holy time.

00:06.506 --> 00:10.704
B'tanay, the time of awakening.

00:14.681 --> 00:19.050
Return to that dark place
from which all life springs.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.952
A primal energy
charges your blood,

00:22.055 --> 00:23.750
an energy of rebirth.

00:23.823 --> 00:29.261
The mind awakens
and focuses on its task.

00:29.329 --> 00:34.961
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.628
Pagh 'tem 'far

00:37.737 --> 00:39.534
B'tanay.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.719
Fresh flowers?

02:35.788 --> 02:37.756
An afternoon on the holodeck?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.554
lt almost feels
like we're dating again.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.117
The secret to a
lasting marriage--

02:42.195 --> 02:43.287
keep the romance alive.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.092
l'm not complaining.

02:47.967 --> 02:48.934
Lecture hall?

02:49.035 --> 02:50.002
Guess again.

02:50.069 --> 02:53.061
Opera house?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.471
Not another one of the
Doctor's performances?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.066
This is a movie house.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.739
This is the old Palace Theater
in Chicago, built in 1932.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.715
Look at the detail
on that crown molding.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.014
lt doesn't look
very functional.

03:07.086 --> 03:09.418
Well, this place
isn't about function.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.514
lt's about fantasy.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.259
Chewing gum.

03:18.331 --> 03:22.097
There is such a thing
as too much authenticity.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.601
Attention to detail.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.262
That's what makes it fun.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.304
Protective lenses?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.605
These will make the
images on the screen

03:31.678 --> 03:33.305
appear three-dimensional.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.938
Let me get this straight.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.482
You've gone
to all this trouble

03:37.550 --> 03:39.541
to program a three-dimensional
environment

03:39.619 --> 03:41.348
that projects
a two-dimensional image,

03:41.421 --> 03:43.184
and now you're asking me
to wear these

03:43.256 --> 03:45.156
to make it look
three-dimensional again?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.658
Great, isn't it?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.753
Crick in your neck?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.485
People didn't go to the movies

04:19.559 --> 04:21.254
just for the movies, you know.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.659
Really? What did they go for?

04:23.730 --> 04:26.528
Well, l'll try to demonstrate.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.208
l can see why this
was so popular.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.208
Shh!

04:41.381 --> 04:44.179
Maybe this would be more fun
if we were alone.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.514
Computer, delete audience.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.858
Who's in the front row?

04:53.926 --> 04:55.052
Must be a glitch.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.928
No. That's Tabor.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.260
This is an emergency.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.823
The gill-man has escaped.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.698
Please, please clear
the ocean area.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.328
Get out, everybody.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.875
Are you okay?

05:15.415 --> 05:17.508
He appears to be in a coma,

05:17.583 --> 05:20.882
but l'm reading
unusual synaptic activity.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.352
-What happened to him?
-l don't know.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.584
l'd like to know what he's been
doing the last few weeks--

05:25.658 --> 05:28.024
where he's worked,
away missions...

05:28.094 --> 05:30.119
l'll access his duty roster.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.796
Was Ensign Tabor wearing these
when he was found?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.392
No, they were on the floor
next to him.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.994
l don't think
they cause comas.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.574
Lights strobing
at certain frequencies

05:42.675 --> 05:44.609
have been known
to induce seizures.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.113
We should analyze the optical
properties of this ''movie.''

05:48.181 --> 05:50.741
When was the last time
you spoke with Mr. Tabor?

05:50.817 --> 05:52.216
About 10, 15 minutes

05:52.285 --> 05:54.446
before B'Elanna and l got here.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.487
He called to say

05:55.555 --> 05:57.489
the program was up and running.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.115
Funny...

05:59.192 --> 06:00.819
Lieutenant?

06:02.729 --> 06:04.321
When we were
in the Maquis together,

06:04.397 --> 06:05.989
we used to joke
that Tabor must have had

06:06.065 --> 06:07.828
his own personal force field.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.162
He went through
a dozen firefights

06:09.268 --> 06:11.259
without even getting
his clothes dirty.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.838
He's still alive.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.440
Perhaps his force field
is holding.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.374
Commander, l've reviewed
the sensor logs

06:18.444 --> 06:20.036
for the four hours
Tabor was here.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.705
All systems were
operating normally.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.180
Safeties were on-line.

06:23.249 --> 06:26.343
Run a level-5 diagnostic
on the logs.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.750
Janeway to Tuvok.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.549
Report to Sick Bay.

06:29.622 --> 06:30.850
On my way.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.118
l've found several
microfractures

06:33.192 --> 06:34.318
in his cranium.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.362
They're minor,
but the pattern suggests

06:36.429 --> 06:38.454
that he suffered
a trauma of some sort.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.897
There's also evidence
of subdermal contusions

06:41.067 --> 06:42.398
along his right shoulder.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.662
This man was attacked.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.237
lt's possible
that whoever did it

06:45.338 --> 06:46.270
is still on board.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.829
Go to Yellow Alert.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.874
Tuvok, l'm putting you in charge

06:49.942 --> 06:50.909
of the investigation.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.375
Aye, Captain.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.956
Security override:
Tuvok-pi-Alpha.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.523
Commander.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.655
Crewman Jor,
if l'm not mistaken,

07:12.732 --> 07:14.290
your quarters are on Deck 4.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.867
l heard what happened to Tabor.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.936
l was looking for a book
to bring to him.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.870
l'm afraid
he's in no condition to read.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.338
l was going to read to him.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.275
l've heard sometimes it helps
to hear a familiar voice.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.171
You and Tabor were friends.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.272
Do you have any idea

07:30.349 --> 07:31.873
why someone would want
to hurt him?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.647
l can't imagine.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.982
Could you tell me

07:36.055 --> 07:39.024
where you were
from 0700 to 1 100 hours

07:39.091 --> 07:40.217
this morning?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.887
On duty... in Engineering.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.088
You can check
with Lieutenant Torres

07:45.164 --> 07:47.564
if you'd like.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.191
That won't be necessary.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.291
Thank you, Crewman.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.237
Harry's found evidence

08:00.313 --> 08:03.180
that someone tampered
with the holodeck sensor logs.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.944
Several files
have been deleted.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.780
Any sign of an outside intruder?

08:06.853 --> 08:08.150
No, nothing.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.317
l believe that a member of
this crew is responsible.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.626
Tabor was well-liked.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.992
What's the motive?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.793
l have one suspect.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.231
Crewman Jor.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.165
l find that hard to believe.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.362
l've known her for a long time.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.302
She and Tabor were friends.

08:27.373 --> 08:28.362
Close friends.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.441
She had access

08:29.509 --> 08:30.976
to his quarters.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.840
A close relationship
is hardly a crime.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.573
lt is my experience
that emotional involvements

08:35.648 --> 08:37.741
often lead
to unpredictable behavior.

08:37.817 --> 08:40.876
That's an opinion...
not evidence.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.113
There may be other suspects.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.020
l intend to question
all crew members

08:45.091 --> 08:46.854
who had recent contact
with Tabor.

08:48.127 --> 08:52.086
l'll check the internal sensors,
see what else l can find.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.229
Commander.

09:02.441 --> 09:06.138
You seem awfully convinced that
one of the crew was behind this.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.772
Now, you can't tell me that's
the only logical conclusion,

09:08.848 --> 09:11.043
because l can think
of a number of others.

09:12.585 --> 09:16.612
l realize my assumptions
seem premature...

09:16.689 --> 09:19.817
but l have a strong instinct
about this.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.053
You might call it a hunch.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.528
l didn't think
Vulcans had hunches.

09:25.898 --> 09:30.198
l can't explain it, Captain,
but l can't ignore it, either.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.737
Someone on board is responsible,

09:32.805 --> 09:35.399
and l intend to find out
who it is.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.678
Pressure is fluctuating
in 1 14.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.342
You'd better check the seals.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.347
Yosa to Engineering.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.181
Engineering?

10:26.192 --> 10:27.557
Hello?

10:43.609 --> 10:46.009
Computer, seal hatch 613-Beta.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.069
Unable to comply.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.145
Crewman Yosa to Security.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.522
His neocortical readings
are identical to Tabor's,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.461
and he has
the same microfractures

11:05.531 --> 11:07.362
along his right temple.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.764
Who discovered him?

11:08.868 --> 11:10.301
Crewman Jor.

11:10.369 --> 11:14.066
Chakotay to Crewman Jor.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.936
Jor, respond.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.804
Computer, locate Crewman Jor.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.869
Crewman Jor is in the Mess Hall.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.330
Crewman Jor.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.008
lf this keeps up,

11:51.077 --> 11:53.341
l may have to open
a special coma ward.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.845
Take a look at their names.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.542
Tell me if anything strikes you.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.776
Former Maquis.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.047
lt's either a coincidence,

12:02.121 --> 12:04.055
or they're being
singled out.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.057
There hasn't been any hostility
between the Maquis

12:06.125 --> 12:07.285
and the rest of the crew

12:07.359 --> 12:08.849
-for years.
-Maybe someone on your crew

12:08.928 --> 12:10.987
couldn't put the
past behind them.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.122
''My'' crew?

12:13.199 --> 12:15.258
Our crew.

12:15.334 --> 12:18.895
Are you any closer
to a diagnosis, Doctor?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.698
They all have
the same disruptions

12:20.806 --> 12:22.171
in their synaptic pathways.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.210
The same cranial
fractures, contusions,

12:25.311 --> 12:27.905
but l still don't
know the cause,

12:27.980 --> 12:29.641
or how to reverse it.

12:29.715 --> 12:30.943
Your investigation?

12:31.016 --> 12:32.677
Nothing conclusive.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.686
Five crewmen in comas,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.119
and we don't have
a single clue?

12:36.188 --> 12:37.587
The assailant
must have access

12:37.656 --> 12:38.918
to security protocols.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.185
There is no other way

12:40.259 --> 12:41.954
he could've escaped detection.

12:42.061 --> 12:42.959
Well, you'd better find a way

12:43.095 --> 12:44.619
to protect the rest
of the Maquis.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.255
l'm running out of beds.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.701
What is it you expect us to do?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.761
Stay alert.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.272
Report anything suspicious
to Commander Tuvok.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.139
l'd rather report to you,
if it's all the same.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.007
He's right.
l've never trusted the Vulcan.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.342
He's betrayed us before.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.041
He was doing his job.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.707
He didn't care
about the Maquis back then.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.716
Why should he now?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.013
We're not Maquis anymore.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.451
Tell that to our friends
in Sick Bay.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.886
Oh, come on, we put
our differences aside

13:09.955 --> 13:10.887
seven years ago.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.583
lt's ancient history.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.649
Maybe history
is repeating itself.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.820
Look, the truth is we don't know
what we're up against,

13:16.896 --> 13:19.387
but the last thing we need right
now is an outbreak of paranoia.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.864
Now, until we get
to the bottom of this,

13:20.933 --> 13:23.834
l want you all
to carry hand phasers.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.530
Nobody goes anywhere alone.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.539
We thought maybe the
intruder left behind

13:28.607 --> 13:29.904
some kind of negative image.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.272
Displaced photons.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.605
Tom figured that if we dampen

13:32.678 --> 13:34.236
the photonic ambiance
and enhance...

13:34.313 --> 13:36.247
We can applaud
Mr. Paris's ingenuity later.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.283
What have you found?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.889
Ensign Tabor.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.256
Now, take a look at this.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.261
lmpressive.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.696
lt doesn't tell us
who the attacker was,

13:53.766 --> 13:56.098
but we do know
someone else was here.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.100
Can you extrapolate

13:57.203 --> 13:58.636
the assailant's
height and weight?

13:58.704 --> 14:03.664
l'd say between 170
and 190 centimeters.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.710
Maybe 7 5 kilograms.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.144
That describes about half
the members of the crew.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.273
At least we can rule out
Naomi Wildman.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.748
ls it possible to increase

14:11.817 --> 14:12.875
the resolution?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.317
We're already working on it.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.215
Keep me informed.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.225
Commander?

14:34.907 --> 14:36.875
Stop it; you're
making me nervous.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.102
lt doesn't make sense.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.940
This ship,
with all its sensors--

14:40.079 --> 14:41.910
how could five
people be attacked

14:41.981 --> 14:43.278
without leaving a trace?

14:43.349 --> 14:44.611
Good question.

14:44.683 --> 14:45.945
Maybe it's a conspiracy.

14:46.051 --> 14:46.949
Ever since Voyager

14:47.052 --> 14:48.917
began sending
datastreams back home,

14:48.988 --> 14:49.955
Starfleet has known

14:50.055 --> 14:52.387
that almost a quarter
of the crew is Maquis.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.390
So?

14:53.459 --> 14:55.120
Maybe they think
we're still dangerous.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.593
Maybe they ordered the Captain

14:56.662 --> 14:58.493
to neutralize the threat.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.122
Yes, that's it.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.099
She's putting us
all into stasis.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.294
The comas
are just a cover story.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.837
lt would be easier
than putting us all in the brig.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.870
lt could be her.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.479
Oh, please.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.781
That'll be all, Crewman.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.549
Please send in Mr. Kim.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.792
l'm still trying to enhance
the photon displacement.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.332
l appreciate your efforts,
Mr. Kim,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.493
but l called you here
for another reason.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.331
ln the last datastream
from Earth,

15:38.437 --> 15:41.167
you received a letter
from someone named Dennis Kim.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.707
My cousin.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.435
ln that letter, he spoke

15:44.510 --> 15:47.138
of your mutual friend,
Maxwell Saroyan.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.304
You read my mail?

15:48.380 --> 15:50.109
Yes.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.673
lsn't that a violation
of privacy protocols?

15:52.751 --> 15:54.480
As the Chief of Security,

15:54.553 --> 15:56.817
l have the authority
to suspend those protocols

15:56.889 --> 15:58.447
under special circumstances.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.582
And what is so special

15:59.658 --> 16:01.091
about a letter from my cousin?

16:01.193 --> 16:02.854
The attacks began

16:02.928 --> 16:05.488
shortly after we received
the last datastream.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.828
Your letter was part
of that transmission.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.832
A lot of people got letters.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.598
28, to be exact,
but only six of them matched

16:13.706 --> 16:17.802
the physical parameters
of the photon displacement.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.174
Am l a suspect?

16:20.245 --> 16:21.678
According to the letter,

16:21.747 --> 16:24.215
your friend, Mr. Saroyan,

16:24.283 --> 16:26.877
was killed by the Maquis
a number of years ago.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.887
You got me, Tuvok. l confess.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.890
l was so distraught
after hearing Max's name

16:32.992 --> 16:35.586
that l fired my Captain
Proton comatizer

16:35.661 --> 16:37.390
at every Maquis l could find.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.796
Your sarcasm could be viewed
as subterfuge.

16:40.866 --> 16:43.426
Tuvok, it's me, Harry.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.628
Do you really think
l'd be capable of this?

16:45.738 --> 16:48.206
My personal views
are irrelevant.

16:48.273 --> 16:51.936
l learned about Max's death
a long time ago.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.341
l was upset,

16:53.412 --> 16:54.674
but l don't blame the Maquis,

16:54.747 --> 16:56.977
and l certainly don't
blame anyone on this ship.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.218
lf that'll be all?

17:05.991 --> 17:07.481
ls everything all right?

17:07.559 --> 17:10.686
This investigation is...

17:10.762 --> 17:13.391
perplexing.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.955
lt defies logic.

17:16.068 --> 17:20.505
l'll keep you posted
on the holodeck analysis.

17:20.571 --> 17:21.868
Doctor to Commander Tuvok.

17:21.940 --> 17:26.104
Report to Sick Bay immediately.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.612
On my way.

17:32.484 --> 17:33.508
l thought you might like

17:33.585 --> 17:35.143
to have a few words
with Mr. Tabor.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.152
How did you revive him?

17:36.221 --> 17:37.153
l didn't.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.713
His synaptic pathways
stabilized on their own.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.851
How do you feel?

17:41.927 --> 17:44.794
Fine, sir. Hungry.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.694
What do you remember?

17:46.765 --> 17:50.565
Not much. l was working
in the holodeck, and...

17:50.669 --> 17:52.034
then l was here.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.402
Was anyone in the
holodeck with you?

17:54.473 --> 17:56.941
No, sir.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.909
Do you know why anyone
would want to hurt you?

17:59.978 --> 18:02.139
No.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.841
What's going on?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.147
Thank you, Ensign.

18:10.522 --> 18:11.921
Crewman.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.824
l remember ordering everyone
to work in pairs.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.156
Where's your partner?

18:17.229 --> 18:18.821
Uh, she's, uh, uh...

18:18.897 --> 18:20.364
Who's your partner?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.364
Lieutenant Torres.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.695
l told her
we shouldn't split up, sir,

18:22.801 --> 18:25.235
but she said
she could handle herself.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.499
You know how stubborn
she can be.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.073
l have a vague idea.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.369
Do you know where she went?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.034
Cargo Bay 2, sir.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.783
B'Elanna?

18:40.519 --> 18:44.250
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Torres.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.985
Lieutenant Torres
is in Cargo Bay 2.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.006
Help me get her to Sick Bay.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.609
This is a holy time.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.343
What?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.615
Security to Cargo Bay 2!

19:22.394 --> 19:25.124
Let the mind awaken
and focus on the task.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.131
My mind to your mind.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.759
My thoughts
to your thoughts.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.830
Captain's Log, supplemental.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.236
Chakotay and B'Elanna

19:37.309 --> 19:40.870
are the latest victims
of our mysterious assailant.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.073
l've decided to put the ship
on a level-10 security alert.

19:44.149 --> 19:47.243
Nonessential personnel
are confined to quarters,

19:47.319 --> 19:50.777
and security teams have been
posted on all decks.

19:52.558 --> 19:56.392
Ensign, run
a metallurgical analysis.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.430
Two more victims regained
consciousness--

19:59.498 --> 20:00.897
Crewmen Yosa and Jor.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.830
Their bio-readings
returned to normal

20:02.935 --> 20:03.993
as if they suffered
nothing worse

20:04.102 --> 20:05.899
than a good night's sleep.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.938
Doesn't make any sense.

20:08.073 --> 20:09.301
lt is, however, a pattern,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.638
and a pattern implies purpose.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.302
We simply have to uncover it.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.811
-Any clues here?
-Not yet.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.812
l'm beginning to think

20:15.881 --> 20:17.849
our perpetrator is a ghost.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.144
Perhaps we should conduct
a seance.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.947
lt couldn't hurt.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.078
l have worked meticulously,

20:23.155 --> 20:25.919
yet he has
outwitted me each time.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.050
How can you be
sure it's a he?

20:28.126 --> 20:30.686
l can't, but l am.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.696
Another hunch?

20:32.764 --> 20:35.130
l can almost sense his presence.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.727
lt's as though
he's challenging me to find him.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.702
l'd say you're
taking this

20:42.774 --> 20:44.435
a little too personally.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.534
-Maybe you should take a break.
-No.

20:46.612 --> 20:47.704
You haven't slept in three days.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.213
Get some rest, meditate,
clear your mind.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.374
My mind is perfectly clear.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.078
l don't want to make this
an order, Tuvok.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.555
l'll go over your scans.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.956
Fresh pair of eyes might help.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.960
Captain.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.515
Resist your doubts.

22:39.124 --> 22:42.685
Don't question your mission.

22:45.430 --> 22:49.958
Filter out
the polarized photons.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.569
Anyone you know?

22:52.671 --> 22:54.002
Tuvok...

22:54.106 --> 22:56.540
Computer, isolate
the precise time index

22:56.608 --> 22:57.666
of this image.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.472
Stardate 54090.4.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.479
Where was Commander Tuvok
at that time?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.879
Access to that information
has been restricted.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.245
By whom?

23:06.318 --> 23:07.876
Access to that information
has been restricted.

23:08.019 --> 23:09.486
Tuvok, what's going on?

23:09.554 --> 23:11.249
Computer, override those
security restrictions--

23:11.323 --> 23:13.587
authorization:
Tuvok-pi-Alpha.

23:13.658 --> 23:15.216
Restrictions overridden.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.887
Where was Commander Tuvok
at the specified time?

23:18.029 --> 23:19.894
Commander Tuvok was
in Holodeck 2.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.990
Computer, based
on the most recent data,

23:22.067 --> 23:23.694
can you give me
a better estimation

23:23.802 --> 23:24.996
of the intruder's height?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.765
182 centimeters.

23:27.873 --> 23:31.206
And what is the height
of Lieutenant Commander Tuvok?

23:31.276 --> 23:33.744
182 centimeters.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.906
Captain, l believe l...

23:36.982 --> 23:38.449
lgnore your doubts.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.511
No.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.076
Commander, lower your weapon.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.749
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

23:45.824 --> 23:47.348
Who are you?

23:53.298 --> 23:54.697
Captain, it would appear

23:54.766 --> 23:58.293
that l am the guilty party.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.496
How is that possible?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.699
l don't know...

24:03.809 --> 24:08.576
but for the safety of the crew,
you must confine me to the brig.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.789
He wants to speak with you,
but l advise you to remain

24:21.860 --> 24:23.885
outside the force field.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.190
Tuvok.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.291
Can you hear me?

24:32.504 --> 24:34.495
l hear you...

24:34.606 --> 24:35.937
but there is another voice

24:36.041 --> 24:37.941
trying to control me.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.841
Another voice? Whose?

24:43.982 --> 24:47.816
''This is... a holy time.''

24:47.886 --> 24:50.081
What did you mean by that?

24:50.155 --> 24:53.522
A primal energy charges
the blood,

24:53.592 --> 24:55.116
an energy of rebirth.

24:55.193 --> 24:57.753
That's what the voice
is telling you?

24:57.829 --> 25:01.492
lt's a Bajoran incantation.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.830
The voice is Bajoran.

25:04.002 --> 25:04.832
We need to get

25:05.003 --> 25:06.163
you to Sick Bay so l can run...

25:06.271 --> 25:07.238
No!

25:08.640 --> 25:09.971
No more scans.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.872
Leave me alone.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.274
Don't question your mission.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.314
Get away from me.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.313
What do you see, Tuvok?

25:22.387 --> 25:24.116
The Bajoran.

25:27.092 --> 25:28.650
lgnore him.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.786
Focus on my voice.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.660
Tell me what's happening.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.895
l believe l've...
l've been attacking

25:37.002 --> 25:40.665
certain members of the crew--
the Maquis--

25:40.772 --> 25:43.206
then investigating the crimes

25:43.275 --> 25:46.802
with no memory of what l'd done.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.607
Attacking them, how?

25:48.680 --> 25:51.843
Mind-melds.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.384
Why?

25:55.654 --> 25:56.985
l don't know.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.317
He is responsible.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.158
What did you do to me?!

26:04.229 --> 26:06.493
Commander...

26:06.565 --> 26:09.261
Commander!

26:09.367 --> 26:11.096
ls he a member of the crew?

26:13.405 --> 26:14.463
Then who is he?

26:16.675 --> 26:18.040
l don't know.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.971
The day the first attack
occurred,

26:23.048 --> 26:25.312
did anything unusual
happen to you?

26:28.086 --> 26:31.021
l was tending to my duties...

26:31.089 --> 26:34.456
l received a letter
from my son.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.586
A letter?

26:41.566 --> 26:42.828
This all started

26:42.901 --> 26:45.870
right after we received
the last datastream.

26:45.937 --> 26:52.501
l reviewed every letter...
except my own.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.442
Stay with him, Doctor.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.548
How long?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.057
29 hours.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.025
She woke up
just before you did.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.824
They've all recovered.
We don't know why.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.192
lt's Tuvok.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.731
Tuvok?

27:14.799 --> 27:15.731
He's in the brig.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.165
Apparently,
he's being manipulated

27:17.268 --> 27:18.735
by some form of mind control.

27:18.803 --> 27:19.735
Can he leave, Mr. Paris?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.237
l don't see why not,

27:21.306 --> 27:23.297
but he should wear
one of these.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.899
There's something
l want to show you.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.573
Exolinguistics always seemed
a little too...

27:30.649 --> 27:31.707
theoretical to me.

27:31.783 --> 27:35.048
l've decided to study
musical composition instead.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.883
l would've sent you
my latest construct,

27:36.955 --> 27:39.719
but they won't give me
enough room in this datastream.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.521
Maybe next time l can...

27:42.594 --> 27:44.027
A letter from his son.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.757
We found another signal embedded
in the message--

27:46.831 --> 27:49.356
a letter within a letter.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.193
Hello, Father.

27:52.303 --> 27:53.895
We received
your last transmission...

27:54.005 --> 27:57.805
Prophets sing.
This is a holy time.

27:57.876 --> 28:01.869
B'tanay, the time of awakening.

28:01.946 --> 28:06.474
Return to that dark place
from which all life springs.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.109
The signal is calibrated
to correspond

28:08.186 --> 28:09.813
with Vulcan synaptic
frequencies.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.117
Tuvok wouldn't have been
consciously aware of it.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.785
Teero.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.760
Teero Anaydis.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.421
He was a Bajoran vedek.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.055
He worked with the Maquis.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.394
Doing what?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.229
Counterintelligence.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.461
He was thrown out

28:25.570 --> 28:28.038
for experimenting
with mind control.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.438
He thought it was a good
way to recruit agents.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.739
Well, apparently,
he was successful

28:33.812 --> 28:36.076
at recruiting
our Tactical Officer.

28:36.147 --> 28:39.241
These incantations and symbols,
they must've triggered something

28:39.317 --> 28:40.249
in Tuvok--

28:40.318 --> 28:41.683
preconditioned behavior,

28:41.753 --> 28:43.846
instructions.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.719
l should've known
you'd show up again.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.815
Commander?

28:47.892 --> 28:49.359
Teero was a fanatic.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.021
He'd go to any extreme
for the Maquis.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.292
He called the rest of us
traitors

28:54.365 --> 28:56.026
for rejecting his ideas.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.499
Swore he'd fight the war

28:57.602 --> 28:58.899
on his own if he had to.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.265
Why instruct Tuvok to mind-meld

29:01.372 --> 29:05.308
with Voyager's Maquis
35,000 light-years from Earth?

29:05.376 --> 29:07.708
l'd like Tuvok to take a look
at this message.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.714
Maybe it'll jog his memory.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.374
Try to decode those symbols.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.813
lt's him.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.980
His name is Teero Anaydis.

29:18.056 --> 29:19.819
Teero?

29:19.958 --> 29:22.552
He worked
for Maquis lntelligence.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.720
Yes.

29:24.796 --> 29:27.560
l remember meeting him.

29:27.632 --> 29:32.126
l was undercover,
doing reconnaissance

29:32.237 --> 29:34.432
on a colony near the Badlands.

29:34.539 --> 29:40.739
He was a vedek at the
Bajoran temple there.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.507
Go on.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.878
We spoke briefly.

29:45.016 --> 29:48.850
He was interested
in Vulcan culture.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.350
That's all l remember.

29:53.424 --> 29:55.824
Maybe that's all he wanted you
to remember.

29:57.328 --> 30:00.422
He was developing some kind
of mind control technique.

30:00.498 --> 30:05.060
We think he used it on you
seven years ago.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.365
What is it?

30:10.475 --> 30:14.434
l-l was restrained.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.639
Very frightened.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.705
What did he do to you?

30:18.783 --> 30:21.115
l can't remember.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.780
Try.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.550
l can't!

30:27.826 --> 30:29.123
Tuvok, if we're
going to help you,

30:29.194 --> 30:30.491
we need to find out.

30:33.431 --> 30:35.092
The last time you meditated,

30:35.166 --> 30:37.191
it helped
the memories resurface,

30:37.302 --> 30:38.599
didn't it?

30:41.072 --> 30:43.973
You've helped me meditate.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.138
l think l've learned a thing
or two about the process.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.477
Let me try to guide you.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.385
Where are you?

31:05.463 --> 31:08.990
ln a laboratory... underground.

31:09.067 --> 31:12.002
ls Teero there?

31:14.472 --> 31:16.838
There is someone...

31:20.345 --> 31:22.472
lt's him.

31:23.681 --> 31:27.082
Describe what's happening.

31:29.988 --> 31:32.047
Lieutenant...

31:32.123 --> 31:35.490
Tuvok? Tuvok?

31:35.560 --> 31:38.495
lt is Lieutenant,
isn't it?

31:38.563 --> 31:42.431
l'm sure your Maquis comrades
would be interested to know

31:42.500 --> 31:44.331
your Starfleet rank.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.426
Don't worry.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.664
l don't plan to expose you.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.468
What do you want?

31:51.843 --> 31:53.708
You.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.138
You're the perfect subject.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.683
For what?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.810
l'm a student of the mind.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.445
Yours is remarkable,

32:04.489 --> 32:05.513
disciplined,

32:05.590 --> 32:06.989
orderly...

32:07.058 --> 32:09.390
on the surface, that is.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.257
Beneath...

32:12.697 --> 32:14.096
roiling emotions,

32:14.165 --> 32:16.030
repressed violence.

32:16.134 --> 32:20.833
ln a sense, you're
two different men.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.999
One l could never
hope to manipulate,

32:24.108 --> 32:26.076
but the other...

32:26.144 --> 32:29.944
l have been trained
to resist mind control.

32:30.048 --> 32:35.111
That's the rational,
logical part of you at work...

32:35.186 --> 32:38.314
but l want to reach
your inner fire,

32:38.389 --> 32:40.050
your spirit.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.216
Why?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.782
Ple... please...

32:42.860 --> 32:44.760
please, don't...

32:44.829 --> 32:47.491
do-don't...

32:50.702 --> 32:54.138
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.971
Stay away from me!

32:58.042 --> 32:59.009
Tuvok...

32:59.077 --> 33:00.601
Complete your mission!

33:00.712 --> 33:02.179
No!

33:02.213 --> 33:03.874
This is a holy time.

33:03.948 --> 33:04.607
Commander...

33:10.021 --> 33:11.989
Tuvok to Chakotay.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.318
Go ahead.

33:13.391 --> 33:17.191
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.695
Understood.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.167
Janeway to Chakotay.

33:25.436 --> 33:27.267
Commander?

33:31.709 --> 33:34.473
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

33:34.545 --> 33:36.308
What did that mean, Tuvok?

33:36.381 --> 33:37.939
Tell me.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.879
This is a holy time...

33:39.951 --> 33:42.112
a time of awakening.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.349
This Teero has awakened you
to do what?

33:47.525 --> 33:49.959
lf you can remember,
you can fight him.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.323
You can resist.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.761
What does he want?

33:54.899 --> 33:56.230
To give us instructions.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.892
What kind of instructions?

33:58.002 --> 33:59.902
Focus on your task.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.235
No.

34:11.616 --> 34:12.742
lt's Chakotay.

34:12.817 --> 34:13.875
What is it?

34:13.985 --> 34:15.509
l'm not sure.

34:15.585 --> 34:19.022
Sick Bay
to Commander Chakotay.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.320
Computer, locate Chakotay.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.188
Commander Chakotay
is in Sick Bay.

34:23.261 --> 34:24.888
Computer, deactivate the EMH.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.259
Commander?

34:32.036 --> 34:34.004
Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.741
l understand.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.594
Deck 1.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.730
Why were you using mind-melds?

35:00.832 --> 35:02.390
What did Teero want you to do?

35:04.135 --> 35:06.399
T... to awaken the others.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.329
Resist your doubts!

35:08.439 --> 35:10.703
No!

35:10.775 --> 35:12.709
Focus on me.

35:12.777 --> 35:13.766
Complete your mission!

35:13.878 --> 35:14.970
Pagh 'tem 'far

35:15.046 --> 35:15.842
B'tanay!

35:18.149 --> 35:20.276
You don't control me!

35:21.486 --> 35:23.010
Good to see you, Commander.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.384
lt's good to be back.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.489
Janeway to the Bridge. Report.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.111
What the hell are you doing?

35:56.187 --> 35:57.586
l think it's obvious.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.748
l'm taking control of your ship.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.018
Within the hour,

36:01.125 --> 36:02.683
all Starfleet personnel

36:02.727 --> 36:04.160
will be locked
in their quarters.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.627
Step back in the brig, Kathryn.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.994
What's Teero done to you?

36:08.065 --> 36:09.828
He simply helped us
remember who we are.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.696
We're Maquis.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.565
We've always been Maquis.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.366
The rebellion ended
three years ago.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.633
You know that.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.675
ln the Alpha Quadrant, maybe.

36:18.743 --> 36:20.904
Not on this ship.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.415
Torres to Chakotay.

36:26.484 --> 36:27.746
Go ahead.

36:27.818 --> 36:29.251
Deck 1 1 is secure.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.288
Acknowledged.

36:33.491 --> 36:36.517
We're 35,000 light-years
from Earth, Chakotay.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.323
No one out here even
knows about the Maquis.

36:38.396 --> 36:39.556
lt doesn't make sense.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.188
There's nothing
you can accomplish.

36:41.265 --> 36:43.733
As long as we exist,
so does the rebellion.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.769
That's Teero talking.

36:45.836 --> 36:46.894
He was unstable.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.335
You said so yourself.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.806
We have no intention
of hurting any of you.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.940
Your orders, Captain?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.639
Take your station.

37:05.323 --> 37:08.690
Captain's Log, Stardate 54101.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.193
Voyager is now
under my command.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.991
We're en route
to an M-Class planet

37:13.064 --> 37:17.228
where we'll relocate
the Starfleet crew.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.496
We're in range.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.504
On screen.

37:22.773 --> 37:25.640
Looks like a nice place
for a Federation colony.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.644
Take us into orbit.

37:27.712 --> 37:31.443
Tuvok, would you mind
joining me in the ready room?

37:38.155 --> 37:41.420
You wished to see me, Captain?

37:41.492 --> 37:43.585
You can drop the formalities.

37:43.661 --> 37:46.095
This is a Maquis ship now.

37:46.163 --> 37:48.358
Vulcan brandy.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.992
l thought we'd have
a drink to celebrate.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.194
A fitting gesture.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.163
To awakenings.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.740
Awakenings.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.570
There are still 23
of our former comrades

38:04.649 --> 38:06.048
who aren't with us yet.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.109
l was hoping you'd be
able to help persuade them.

38:09.186 --> 38:12.349
l'm prepared to mind-meld
with the remaining Maquis,

38:12.423 --> 38:16.689
to convey
Teero's instructions.

38:16.761 --> 38:20.390
lt'll be nice to have
my old crew back.

38:22.767 --> 38:26.533
You've been a big help
to us, Tuvok...

38:26.637 --> 38:30.368
but l can't forget
what happened seven years ago.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.706
You have a history
of betraying the Maquis.

38:33.778 --> 38:36.269
lt won't happen again.

38:36.347 --> 38:37.746
We have a small crew.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.147
l have to be able
to trust everyone,

38:40.217 --> 38:42.378
especially my Tactical Officer.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.282
Bring her in.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.295
Consider this a test
of your loyalty.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.461
lt's set to kill.

39:00.571 --> 39:03.563
You said you wouldn't
hurt anyone.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.510
You're in control
of your actions--

39:15.586 --> 39:18.714
not Chakotay, not Teero.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.048
Tuvok?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.955
Don't do this.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.506
This phaser is defective.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.781
Take her back to the brig.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.822
You pass.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.125
Now, we've got
some tactical issues to review.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.429
l want to reroute
all weapons control

40:05.536 --> 40:07.128
to my command console...

40:09.540 --> 40:15.740
My mind to your mind.
My thoughts to your thoughts.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.455
Kim and Paris engineered

40:26.524 --> 40:28.116
a little breakout on Deck 6.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.558
We've contained them all
behind a force field.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.289
We should begin
the evacuation.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.853
Start beaming them down.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.957
Begin on Deck 2, Section 01.

40:37.134 --> 40:38.601
Belay that order.

40:38.702 --> 40:41.671
Tuvok informed me
that this planet

40:41.772 --> 40:43.467
has an unstable atmosphere.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.497
Go to Astrometrics

40:45.609 --> 40:46.871
and scan for an alternative.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.206
What are you talking about?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.270
There's nothing wrong
with the atmosphere.

40:50.347 --> 40:52.008
We don't have time
to debate this.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.142
Well, l can scan from here.

41:01.091 --> 41:04.993
Chakotay, what's going on?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.060
Stand down.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.806
Your weapon.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.638
l thought you might like
your ship back.

41:22.546 --> 41:25.037
No more rebellion?

41:25.115 --> 41:28.050
lt took another mind-meld
with Tuvok, but l'm fine.

41:28.118 --> 41:29.449
Tuvok, you're all right?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.147
l am in control again, Captain.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.213
Whatever you said
to him, it worked.

41:33.290 --> 41:36.054
lt's good to have you back,
Commander.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.344
All ready for Attack
of the Lobster People?

41:54.445 --> 41:56.470
l am not familiar
with that species.

41:56.547 --> 41:57.980
You will be soon enough.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.744
l haven't completed
my security rounds.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.479
You have now.

42:06.156 --> 42:07.453
Buttered or unbuttered?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.016
Thank you, Neelix.

42:14.298 --> 42:17.699
How's right here?

42:17.801 --> 42:20.099
l saved you a seat.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.469
How long is this...
entertainment?

42:23.541 --> 42:24.940
l'm not sure.

42:25.042 --> 42:28.307
Tom said something
about a ''double-feature.''

42:28.379 --> 42:30.643
l've been meaning
to ask you...

42:30.714 --> 42:34.241
how did you know
that phaser wasn't charged?

42:34.318 --> 42:35.945
Chakotay doubted my loyalty.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.647
He wouldn't have given
me an active weapon.

42:40.691 --> 42:43.387
Not exactly ironclad logic.

42:43.460 --> 42:46.827
Call it... a hunch.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.593
Remind me to pay
more attention to your hunches.

42:49.667 --> 42:50.759
Shh!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
