03:13.600 --> 03:15.192
People are decent, mostly.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.033
I say mostly because

03:17.120 --> 03:19.395
we all know there are some
real pricks out there.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.958
People are decent because they
never forget how to reach out.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.270
Now and then,
they'll even surprise you.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.231
But then again,
sometimes they won't.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.750
I wanna be remembered as the
awesomest dodgeball player ever.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.753
I wanna win an Olympic
gold medal in dodgeball.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.355
This will make the world
a better place 'cause

03:42.440 --> 03:45.352
I'll inspire other kids
to be dodgeball champions.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.479
And that's what I
think about my legacy.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.798
Good, Tommy.
A little basic,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.348
but some solid grammar
and paragraph construction.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
Well done.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.993
Who wants to go next?

03:58.560 --> 04:00.039
Henry?
Huh?

04:01.480 --> 04:02.595
Oh, yeah.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.873
We can all talk
about making our mark,

04:17.959 --> 04:22.272
but isn't it just comfort food
to stave off existential crisis?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.990
I mean, in the end, Tommy,
you're gonna realize that

04:27.120 --> 04:29.793
dodgeball isn't
even an Olympic sport.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.315
But our legacy isn't what
we write on our résumé

04:34.400 --> 04:36.994
or how many commas we have
in our bank account.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.600
It's who we're lucky enough
to have in our lives

04:39.920 --> 04:41.433
and what we can
leave them with.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.438
The one thing we do know,
we're here now.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.995
So I say we do the best we can while
we're on this side of the dirt.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.989
And that's what I
think about my legacy.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.189
Henry.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.159
Remind me again why we can't
put you in a gifted school.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.475
'Cause it's better for my
psychosocial development

05:05.560 --> 05:06.896
for me to interact
with a peer group

05:06.920 --> 05:08.353
in a normal
school environment.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.352
Oh, yeah. Okay.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Thank you.

05:13.320 --> 05:19.509
And so that's 3,000 of TannenTech
at 76 with a stop-loss at 70?

05:19.960 --> 05:22.713
And, you know what?
Give me ten Liffcom with Aluminad.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.873
Uh, two and a quarter.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.393
Okay, yeah.
I think it'll work.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.536
Oh, let's just say
I had the benefit

05:29.560 --> 05:30.840
of being born
into a bull market.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.993
Sorry I'm late.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.230
Buckle up.
Wrestle this backpack.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.358
I really wish
you'd get a new car.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.736
It's not like you can't
afford it or anything.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.716
That isn't the point.
And besides...

05:46.800 --> 05:48.176
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.960
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.629
Why won't
you let me help?

06:20.720 --> 06:22.790
I only broke one
of them. Over.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.600
Which led to an electrical fire. Over.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.075
Waffle irons
are tricky. Over.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.474
I just wish I could make
something like you do.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.869
Okay. Come on, then.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.480
Okay, what do you wanna make?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.873
A flying trampoline.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.720
You might
wanna start small.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.479
Rocket boots.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.512
Mmm, that's kind
of hard, too.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.356
Okay. You have to
build in a fail-safe.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.513
It's all about timing, setup,
covering every contingency.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.074
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.113
Like the waffle iron?

07:24.480 --> 07:25.480
Waffle irons are tricky.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.475
What if there are sharks?

07:34.760 --> 07:35.909
Too shallow.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.274
How about piranhas?

07:37.400 --> 07:38.753
Indigenous to Africa.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.872
Henry says South America.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.151
Fine,
South America.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.520
But don't you worry,

07:44.600 --> 07:46.192
if anything attacks you,

07:46.280 --> 07:48.475
anything indigenous
to our region,

07:49.040 --> 07:50.393
I'll be in here
in a flash.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.235
Okay?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.151
Oh, what the heck!

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
Okay.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.319
You okay?
Yep.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.159
Call out the capitals.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.276
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.549
Easy.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.837
Augusta, Maine.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.998
Salem, Oregon.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.992
Albany, New York.

08:15.080 --> 08:20.074
Hey, Mom, what is this charge
for $147.50 at Funtime Cove?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.792
Uh, bouncy castle
for Peter's birthday.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.438
The one that
smelled like feet.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.158
Bismarck,
North Carolina.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.238
Isn't that one of
the other Norths?

08:28.360 --> 08:29.918
Tallahassee, Florida.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.355
Did our financial statement
come in the mail today?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.828
Juneau, Alaska.
Yeah, I forgot to give it to you.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.831
You should really read it
and know what it says.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.318
Annapolis, Maryland.
Wrong.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.154
Right.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.917
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.958
You know it
doesn't actually help

08:45.040 --> 08:46.256
when you lean
into it like that.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.395
Sure it does.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.035
Look at that.
Look at that!

08:50.800 --> 08:54.429
"So he dyed his coat all
the colors of the rainbow.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.874
"Then the other squirrels
were jealous and sorry

08:57.960 --> 09:01.270
"because he looked
punk rock awesome.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.594
"And they learned
that real coolness

09:04.680 --> 09:07.035
"isn't about
the color of your fur,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.918
"it's about what
you've got beneath it.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.272
"The end."

09:14.480 --> 09:15.480
So?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.471
Um, it was well-told.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.075
Hey!

09:20.320 --> 09:22.550
You try writing and drawing something.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.108
It's about something.
It's a metaphor.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.158
It seems
someone hasn't grasped

09:27.240 --> 09:29.708
the blue squirrel's
moral of acceptance.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.116
Young Engineer Award?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.920
When did you get this one?

09:41.480 --> 09:42.480
It's no big deal.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.752
I'd be psyched if I won that.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.478
I wouldn't just
toss it in the corner.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.240
You can have it.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.077
Okay. Let's get your
little tushies into bed.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.310
You think I'm running
a nightclub here?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.513
Can we do
movie night tomorrow?

09:57.880 --> 09:59.677
Oh. I can't, hon,
I've got the dinner shift.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.671
Mom, I told you, you don't
have to work anymore.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.314
What do you mean, she doesn't
have to work anymore?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
Nothing.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.596
I'm just saying,
it's not necessary.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.996
Just stay home
and work on your storybooks.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.360
Oh!

10:17.440 --> 10:18.440
I'm sorry.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.793
Are you sure?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.872
Because... I mean,
I don't wanna invade

10:24.040 --> 10:25.758
your sense of personal
space or anything...

10:25.840 --> 10:26.989
Mom!

10:30.720 --> 10:31.948
Good night.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
On or off?

10:38.920 --> 10:40.239
- On.
- Off.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.829
Open or closed?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.148
- Open.
- Closed.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.073
Yikes, it's hot.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.594
Hey, Mom?
Yeah.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.952
You double-click here...
Easy!

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
It's expensive.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.998
Then you download the bank statement
directly into the program.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.230
Who says you're not smart?
No one.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.914
Show me what I
just taught you.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.473
I'm not a child, Henry.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.794
Show me.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.150
Okay. That's enough.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.400
Um, let's see.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.596
You just deleted last month.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.456
You're not doing
that right.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.118
What?
Here, Mom.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.948
Susan.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.318
Oh, great. It's Glenn.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.388
Mr. Sickleman.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.195
Susan.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.280
Hey.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.198
I was wondering, would you mind
keeping an eye on your lawn?

11:38.600 --> 11:41.512
Your unraked leaves are
blowing over to my property.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.919
It's just hard to keep up.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.157
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I'll try.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.640
Sorry, Glenn.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.552
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.960
Come here.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.874
Hey!

11:59.480 --> 12:00.515
Look at you.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.635
Hey.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.760
Found this in the
woods.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.872
Little cops in training,
huh, boys?

12:10.080 --> 12:12.230
Sorry, uh, to be a pain
about the leaves.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.517
I know it doesn't seem like a big deal,
but... No, no. It is. I... I get it.

12:16.360 --> 12:21.070
Um, moving forward, I vow to
mind my leaf distribution.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.229
Appreciate it.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.111
My future daughter-in-law.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.349
Oh, God.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.038
She's adorable.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.832
But her stepfather...

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
Ugh!

12:35.560 --> 12:36.675
Glenn?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.159
Mr. Sickleman.

12:42.840 --> 12:43.955
Late again.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.189
Dog ate my car.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.670
Table seven says their eggs are
too wet, so have fun with that.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.513
Hey, toots,
how's tricks?

12:50.960 --> 12:52.120
Oh, the Feds are all over me.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.674
Had to move money into
my Swiss bank account.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.512
And the rates are terrible.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.176
Tell me about it.
When I won the lottery,

12:58.200 --> 12:59.553
you should have
seen the taxes.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.116
$82,000,000 turned into $16,000,000.
What am I gonna buy with that?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.599
Hey, table seven is real.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.835
You sell the castle yet?

13:05.920 --> 13:08.798
Corsica, but I'm having a hard
time unloading Monte Carlo.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.231
My boobs are up here.
Yeah, geez.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.358
Miss?
This isn't what I ordered.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
Hey, Susan?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.154
The new payroll gal ain't
exactly the brightest.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.360
She mailed your
paycheck home

13:19.400 --> 13:21.280
even though I told her you
were coming in today.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.834
It's a nice
neighborhood you live in.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.436
I always figured you
for an apartment somewhere.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.000
Thank God for alimony,
huh?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.755
Yeah, right.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.560
I guess I could just set you up with
direct deposit if that's easier.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.478
Uh, I don't know.
I'll have to ask Henry.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.232
You have to ask
your 11-year-old?

13:38.320 --> 13:40.550
Twelve. He's almost 12.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.016
Henry!

13:44.040 --> 13:46.349
I need your help!
Morris took your medal!

13:47.240 --> 13:48.753
Hurry! Let's just go!

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
Hey!

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
Thank you, Dot.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
There he is.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.118
Hey, Christina.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
You okay?

14:21.280 --> 14:22.872
Yeah. I'm good.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.000
Fight! Fight! Fight!

14:24.080 --> 14:25.957
Henry! Henry!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.077
Peter! Hey!
Henry!

14:29.160 --> 14:30.275
Let him go!

14:30.480 --> 14:31.480
Henry!

14:34.880 --> 14:35.915
The medal!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.360
What's your problem, dude?
I told you to stay away from him.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.788
He's a little douche bag.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.256
You, you're smart at least.
But him?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.696
All right,
come on, guys, break it up.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.029
He's a nothing.
He's a nothing.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.560
Where were you?
Remember that!

14:47.640 --> 14:48.640
I'm sorry. Shh!

14:48.720 --> 14:50.119
Thank you, let's go.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.190
Come on, Peter.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.236
I just said sorry to you,
like, a thousand times.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.788
Oh...

15:00.520 --> 15:03.080
I promise I will not
let Morris near you again.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.991
Okay? I promise.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.472
I bet I can
make you smile.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.640
Mom's home!

16:01.360 --> 16:02.475
Hello?

16:03.560 --> 16:04.959
Oh, my munchkin!

16:05.960 --> 16:09.555
What...
Geez, Henry. Just say no.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.428
Surprise.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.520
Sheila!

16:13.360 --> 16:14.588
Aw. Hello, Peter.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.560
Hank.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.959
It's actually Henry.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.536
I think you'd be able
to retain at least

16:19.560 --> 16:21.391
one simple name somewhere
beyond that haircut.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.280
Nice goggles. They go well
with your misshapen head.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.191
Don't you two
start already.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.475
Now, I'm gonna pretend
all this didn't happen,

16:28.880 --> 16:30.120
'cause I've had
a hell of a day,

16:30.200 --> 16:33.988
and Sheila and I are just gonna
hang out a little. Okay?

16:35.840 --> 16:37.176
They're gonna get
so drunk right now.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.394
I know.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.879
I heard that.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.830
My mom...
But my mom was a bitch.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.275
But she was,
like, she wasn't.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.195
She would try to...
She scared my friends.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.508
How?

16:58.680 --> 17:01.069
You know those, um,
like, Dracula teeth?

17:01.160 --> 17:03.469
Yeah. For Halloween?
Yeah.

17:03.840 --> 17:09.039
And if a... If a guy
asked me out at all,

17:09.119 --> 17:12.396
and he would come over,
she would wear her Dracula teeth.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.471
Ugh, God.
And then she'd just, like...

17:15.839 --> 17:17.193
Slowly smile, like...

17:17.280 --> 17:19.031
Oh, maybe she was
being protective.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.553
She was horrif...

17:20.640 --> 17:22.232
She was being protective.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.112
Aw.
She was great.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.675
She was just trying
to raise me right.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.116
She failed miserably.
But she should win an award.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.074
Please don't let
me screw 'em up.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.119
I mean, you just do
the best you can, right?

17:39.800 --> 17:44.078
But they're kids, little
tiny creatures in the world,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.310
waiting for life
to just happen.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.016
I don't know
how you do it.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.554
Honestly, I don't know how
you do it all by yourself.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.073
Come on. I have Henry.

17:52.920 --> 17:58.074
Find me another male of the species
who's more grown-up than him.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.958
I'd like to.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.199
Can I sleep here?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.596
Henry! Let's move it!

19:36.960 --> 19:38.279
There you go.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.630
Hey, sweetie. You okay?

19:43.040 --> 19:44.439
Uh, fine. Why?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.400
What's with the face?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.830
Uh, nothing.
It's just a headache.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
Okay.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.233
Hey, sweetie.
Need a lift?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.355
You okay?

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
Yeah.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.959
Now for some bad news.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.233
Zach's mom dropped off
donuts for his birthday.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.639
Yeah!

20:44.840 --> 20:45.875
Okay, class.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.475
Time to start thinking about your
acts for next month's talent show.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.079
I'm handing out forms now.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.754
So, be sure to bring back
parents' signatures.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.195
Henry, where are you going?

20:57.240 --> 20:58.275
Henry!

20:58.640 --> 21:01.279
God damn it, Janice. How much
longer does this have to go on?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.588
What else do you need to see?

21:02.680 --> 21:04.830
I believe you mean
Principal Wilder.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.077
Henry, we're not going
down this road again.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.112
Bruises, exhaustion,
decreased school performance?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.336
What have her
grades been this year?

21:11.360 --> 21:12.536
You know I can't
tell you anything

21:12.560 --> 21:13.760
about another
student's grades.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.796
You're under no
obligation to investigate.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.309
You need merely
report suspicion of.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.675
It's your ethical
responsibility as an educator.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.030
I made preliminary
inquiries which turned...

21:23.120 --> 21:25.016
So make secondary inquiries.
Which turned up nothing.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.679
It's more complicated
than that, Henry.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.876
Mr. Sickleman is
the Police Commissioner

21:29.960 --> 21:31.616
and an upstanding member
of this community.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.376
As if upstanding members
of the community don't...

21:33.400 --> 21:35.118
These type of
baseless allegations

21:35.200 --> 21:37.475
can have extremely
serious ramifications.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.834
Jesus, do...

21:40.440 --> 21:41.714
Do these things
mean anything?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.234
I have known Mr. Sickleman
longer than you've been alive.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.639
Don't condescend to me.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.508
I'm not gonna subject him to public
scrutiny without conclusive evidence.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.315
Fine.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.719
I will handle
this without you.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.960
Henry Carpenter,
come in. Over.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.114
When do you think Mom's
gonna be here? Over.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.355
Sorry!

22:15.080 --> 22:16.274
Where are we going?

22:17.040 --> 22:18.712
We have to
stop by Sheila's.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.477
She was supposed to work the morning
shift, but she didn't show up.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.835
Stop that.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.514
Sheila!

22:29.800 --> 22:30.994
Hello?

22:31.520 --> 22:32.555
Found her.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
Oh.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.995
Lovely.
You brought the children.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.879
Hello, Hank.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.916
Sheila.
Looking radiant as ever.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.075
Let me guess.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.832
Drinking away
memories of that ex

22:50.920 --> 22:53.115
who left you in the lurch
with two young boys?

22:53.480 --> 22:54.754
That was you.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.640
Oh, yeah.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.119
I covered for you at work.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.834
Come on. Get up.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.069
No!

23:03.800 --> 23:05.392
No. Have a sip.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.315
You're weakening.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.995
Yay.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.109
Oh, yay.
Oh, us.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.589
It's really great how you
enable her alcoholism.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.750
Sheila is not an alcoholic.

23:29.840 --> 23:30.955
Yes, she is.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.913
Would you relax?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.070
Honestly, she's such
a sharp dresser.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.276
Didn't acid wash
go out before I was born?

23:38.360 --> 23:40.216
Compared to some of the
shit in her closet... Mom.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.275
That's nothing.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.952
Don't curse
in front of Peter.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.632
Like it matters anymore.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.709
"Mom has
a two-headed baby."

23:48.800 --> 23:50.791
Bet that made for
a trying delivery.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.032
Right in the middle
of the damn freezer.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.034
You had all day, you've had
all day to talk about it.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.034
Henry.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.718
It's none of our business.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.434
You'll only
make it worse.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.994
Hey!

24:09.200 --> 24:10.952
I don't care!
Are you kidding me?

24:11.280 --> 24:12.872
Henry. No.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.871
Stop. Come on.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.976
Child Protective Services.
How can I direct your call?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.150
Uh, hello? Uh...
Hello?

24:37.280 --> 24:38.474
Can I help you?
Uh, yes.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.472
Can I have the intake
caseworker, please?

24:41.560 --> 24:43.790
A caseworker? That's me.
How can I help you?

24:43.880 --> 24:47.555
Oh, hi. Um, I'd like to
report a child abuse case.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.278
Okay.
Um...

24:49.360 --> 24:51.476
Is somebody hurting you?
No, it's not me.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.596
How old are you, honey?
Eleven.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.199
And what's going on?

24:55.280 --> 24:56.336
Um...
Where can I reach you?

24:56.360 --> 24:58.296
Look, I'm not... I'm not gonna
give you my phone number.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.788
That's why I called the anonymous
reporting line. Get it?

25:00.880 --> 25:01.880
Okay. Stay calm.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.751
Henry!
How can I help?

25:04.240 --> 25:07.630
Um, the address is
3328 Spindle Lane.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.314
And the abuser's name
is Glenn Sickleman.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.336
Um, thank you
very much. Goodbye.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.560
Wait.
Don't hang up. Hold on...

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Hey, Henry.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
Hey.

25:26.760 --> 25:29.035
For your brother.
It's one of mine.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.115
It's, um, very
considerate of you.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.515
I hope he likes it okay.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.715
Hey, sweetie.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.473
Henry told me you're gonna
do a dance next month.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.753
Can't wait to see it.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Hey, Glenn.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.759
You must be excited about
the talent show. Oh.

25:45.560 --> 25:49.394
Yeah. I... I confess, I get a little
impatient at things like that.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.709
I... I thought Janie's
mom was taking you?

25:53.640 --> 25:54.709
Jenna.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.074
They're out of town that week.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.760
Well, I can,
I'm happy to take her.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.958
I'll, uh...
I'll pick her up.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.520
Great.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.640
Mrs. Carpenter?

26:06.240 --> 26:07.798
Sweetie, please. Susan.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.312
Henry and Peter,
they're lucky to have you.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.953
Thank you.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.475
And your father's
lucky to have you, too.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.749
Stepfather.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.910
I want you to stop
focusing on academics

26:36.000 --> 26:37.752
and spend a little
more time goofing off.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.159
Pick up a bad habit
or something.

26:41.120 --> 26:45.636
Gambling, booze,
get hammered, rob a bank.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.273
Come on!

26:49.280 --> 26:50.554
You're no fun.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.029
Mom?
Mmm.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.875
That woman today,
at the grocery store,

27:05.560 --> 27:09.519
you didn't do
anything to help her.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.479
I told you,
just wasn't our business.

27:15.760 --> 27:20.276
I think when someone hurts someone else,
I... I think it is our business.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.631
Well, I know
it seems that way,

27:22.760 --> 27:24.671
but there was
nothing I could do.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.751
Yeah. Mom, if...
If everybody did that,

27:29.120 --> 27:32.749
then there would be no one
to look out for the people

27:32.880 --> 27:35.155
who just can't look
out for themselves.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.912
So what should
I have done?

27:38.880 --> 27:40.359
I didn't want things
to get violent.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.596
Violence isn't the worst
thing in the world.

27:48.680 --> 27:49.749
What is, then?

27:52.280 --> 27:53.633
Apathy.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.679
I don't know why they would've called.
Basically...

28:59.480 --> 29:01.630
Hey, Christina.
How are you?

29:23.680 --> 29:24.999
"Sickleman."

30:05.680 --> 30:09.355
Four-hundred foot drop to the south,
and deep water to the north.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.240
Here?

30:24.280 --> 30:25.395
Keep going.

30:30.920 --> 30:31.920
Here?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Keep going.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.316
But if I go any further,
I'll fall in.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.391
Okay. Now hold up
some fingers.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.600
Three.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.600
Roger that.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.070
Yeah, that's what
I'm looking for.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.752
How many rounds per minute?

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
Twelve-hundo.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.311
What's she run?
Eight.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.114
Eight hundred dollars?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.038
No,
eight hundred drachma.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
Funny.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.039
Needs a license, I suppose?

31:33.160 --> 31:34.309
Yeah. Federal.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.471
Yeah. Well, I left
that one at home today.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.199
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir. I don't
run that kind of establishment.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.798
And what if
Domenic sent me?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.269
Be $1,100.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.998
Yeah, okay. Come around
back in a half an hour.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.276
Give my regards
to Domenic.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.557
Jesus, Mom. Really?

32:21.280 --> 32:23.077
Know why they call me
the Can Opener, Henry?

32:24.720 --> 32:27.154
No. But I'm guessing it has
something to do with whoop-ass?

32:28.880 --> 32:30.029
Oh, come on.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.595
Turn it off.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.896
Just as soon as I level
up on these motherf...

32:34.920 --> 32:36.194
Mom!

32:41.480 --> 32:42.913
Enchilada number one.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.836
Enchilada number two.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.594
How come he gets to be
enchilada number one?

32:52.720 --> 32:53.720
'Cause he's older.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.275
It's fine. You can be
enchilada number one.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.874
All right.
Enchilada number one.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.029
Good night.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.074
Good night.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.711
Uh, Mom, not again.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.909
Sing it.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.354
Okay. Fine.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.636
Before you,
I thought I lost

33:30.760 --> 33:35.038
They called the game,
but not for us

33:35.760 --> 33:40.117
Drowned in thought
and caught in a stare

33:40.920 --> 33:45.436
Talkin' to things
that are not there

33:46.560 --> 33:50.473
Then you took my hand

33:50.560 --> 33:54.758
Transformation began

33:55.280 --> 34:00.479
Commotion where
it once was still

34:03.600 --> 34:06.034
Fireworks explode

34:06.120 --> 34:10.556
Front row tickets to the show

34:10.639 --> 34:15.760
This hand,
I will never let it go

34:18.320 --> 34:24.793
Your hand,
I will never let it go

34:28.239 --> 34:29.753
Good night.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
I love you.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.239
I love you, too.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.440
Love you.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.190
That is not a one-way
street, you know.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.594
Love you, Mom.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.074
On or off?

34:48.159 --> 34:49.353
- On.
- Off.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
Open or close?

34:51.040 --> 34:52.155
- Open.
- Close.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.671
Mom! Mom!

35:03.760 --> 35:04.909
Mom!

35:05.200 --> 35:07.191
Mom! Mom!
God. What is it?

35:07.800 --> 35:08.949
Mom!
I'm coming!

35:09.040 --> 35:10.758
Mom! Mom!

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
Mom!

35:13.200 --> 35:14.394
Henry.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.352
Henry. Henry, baby.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.392
Honey. Oh, my God.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.231
Call 9-1-1, Peter!

35:21.640 --> 35:24.359
I got you. I got...
Oh, God, Henry.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.590
He looks postictal,
but we've got a strong pulse.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.671
Henry? Henry?

35:28.960 --> 35:29.960
Henry, can you hear me?

35:30.280 --> 35:31.474
Mrs. Carpenter, your son.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.198
Henry?
Your other son.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.576
- I need to get some history.
- Get him some blood...

35:41.120 --> 35:42.696
- Where's my CT?
- Still waiting for it.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.720
Thank you, Kathy.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.473
Mrs. Carpenter, my name is David Daniels.
I'm a neurosurgeon.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.560
Hi.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.397
Let's see what's
going on with you, pal.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.836
Now Henry, I'm gonna shine
this light in your eyes.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.030
Did you witness the seizure?
Yes.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.474
What did it look like?

35:57.080 --> 36:00.629
Um, his whole body was
shaking and jerking.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.920
Has he been
having headaches?

36:02.080 --> 36:04.310
No.
Nothing major. Just...

36:04.680 --> 36:06.318
You have?
For how long?

36:06.400 --> 36:07.833
Three... Three, four months.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.496
Dr. Daniels,
you asked for these.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.829
You said it wasn't
anything serious.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.911
Why didn't you say
something, honey?

36:15.360 --> 36:17.078
Kathy, we need
to take him upstairs.

36:17.160 --> 36:18.878
What? Where are
you taking him?

36:20.600 --> 36:22.397
We need to take
him to surgery.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.558
Your son has a definite mass,
and it looks swollen.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.835
It's abutting some
critical structures.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.514
I know this is hard for you, but
we need your consent to proceed.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.272
Dr. Daniels, he's seizing.
I...

36:34.040 --> 36:35.216
Push one mil
of Ativan, stat.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.240
Henry?
Mrs. Carpenter,

36:36.280 --> 36:37.376
we need you to
sign off on this.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.039
I can't sign
this without asking him.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.156
We need parental consent.
It's all right, Henry.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.216
- When did he last get his...
- There we go.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.389
It's all right.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.838
Come on. All right. Let's go.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.040
All right. You're all right.
You're all right.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.476
Henry, we're gonna
take you to the O.R.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.189
Mom?

38:13.400 --> 38:14.879
Hey, baby.

38:15.840 --> 38:20.197
Yeah. I'm here.
I'm right here.

38:21.880 --> 38:25.031
Is... Is everything okay?

38:49.760 --> 38:50.954
Um...

38:51.520 --> 38:53.078
What about this?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.912
Will you at least
eat the brownie?

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
Hey, kiddo.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.194
Glad to have you back.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.033
You must be Peter.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.233
What do you say, you give me a moment
to talk to Henry and your mom?

39:07.320 --> 39:08.639
That be all right?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.152
Yeah, why don't
you come with me?

39:22.120 --> 39:24.634
Henry, you've got something
in your head right now,

39:25.960 --> 39:27.439
something we call a tumor.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.149
It's not a good thing.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.509
So we had to see if
we could remove it

39:34.280 --> 39:36.032
without hurting any
part of your brain.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.549
Uh...

39:38.640 --> 39:40.039
It's tricky stuff.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.192
And we were able
to get some of it.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.315
Come on, man.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.680
Excuse me?

39:48.480 --> 39:52.189
This kind of rapid onset,
cutting right away,

39:52.280 --> 39:53.918
the expression
on your face,

39:55.120 --> 39:57.475
the way I see it,
it's got to be

39:57.560 --> 40:00.358
a high grade ependymoma
or a glioblastoma.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.396
I don't know why I
didn't think about that.

40:05.160 --> 40:09.073
I... What with the headaches and the...
The blurred vision,

40:09.160 --> 40:11.037
I just thought
it was stress.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.840
Large mass?

40:16.520 --> 40:17.669
Uh...

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
Yeah.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.760
Extended?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Yeah, it is.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.235
Has it spread to
critical structures?

40:31.840 --> 40:35.196
Well, we tried to resect it.
But unfortunately...

40:38.960 --> 40:40.154
I see.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.440
My MRI?

41:01.560 --> 41:02.675
Irradiate?

41:11.920 --> 41:13.148
I'm sorry.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.071
I'd like to be alone, please.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.708
Sweetie, I don't think...
Mom.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.279
Um...

41:25.520 --> 41:26.714
I'd like to be alone.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.589
Okay.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.873
Okay, class,
Henry is going to be

42:20.960 --> 42:23.110
in the hospital
for a little while.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.031
He's really sick.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.759
So, I thought it
would be a nice idea

42:28.360 --> 42:31.272
if we all sent him
some get well cards.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.000
Is he
gonna be all right?

42:34.320 --> 42:35.435
Well, Tommy...

42:35.560 --> 42:36.629
He has to, doesn't he?

42:36.720 --> 42:39.678
I mean, it's Henry.
He's got to be okay.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.593
We don't know just yet.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
Hello, Hank.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.519
Hey, fashion roadkill.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.509
What you doin'?

43:18.120 --> 43:19.473
Workin' on some notes.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.311
Mmm. Think you're pretty
brilliant, don't ya?

43:22.400 --> 43:23.674
I prefer "precocious."

43:29.800 --> 43:31.756
Shit, Hank. Why'd you
have to go and do this?

43:38.960 --> 43:39.960
Henry.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.275
Look, even though we...

43:49.360 --> 43:50.360
I know.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.871
It's called
reaction formation.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
What?

43:56.440 --> 43:58.396
It seems we have
an antithetical relationship.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.031
But we're just
behaving towards each other

44:03.160 --> 44:04.957
the opposite of
how we really feel.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.555
I think you're pretty,
thus, I insult you.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.551
Childish, yes.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.628
But I am a child.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.512
You take care, Hank.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.308
Do you have a 9?

44:47.440 --> 44:48.589
Do you have a 10?

44:49.400 --> 44:50.400
Go fish.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.960
Um...

45:00.400 --> 45:02.960
Hey, Peter, they have good
ice cream in the cafeteria.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.360
Would you mind
grabbing me some?

45:06.280 --> 45:07.280
Here, sweetie.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.395
So, I was thinking
when we get out of here...

45:16.480 --> 45:18.516
Mom, I need you to bring in
the financial files.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.336
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.696
They're in the second file
drawer in my cabinet.

45:21.720 --> 45:22.720
Not now.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.416
I also need to get a hold
of the retirement statements.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.032
Let's talk about it next week.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.639
I may not be here next week.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.950
I'm... I'm just
gonna get some water.

46:03.840 --> 46:04.989
I don't want any.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.155
Me, neither.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.560
Peter?

46:17.480 --> 46:20.438
I have to tell you something.
And it's very important. Okay?

46:26.360 --> 46:27.360
After...

46:30.720 --> 46:31.994
After...

46:37.320 --> 46:39.151
It's essential
that you make sure

46:39.280 --> 46:41.111
Mom reads my red notebook.
Okay?

46:41.960 --> 46:43.996
But not you. Just Mom.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.915
I want you to
make her yourself.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.016
Peter, I'm trusting
you to do this

46:49.040 --> 46:51.235
because you're the person I
trust most in the world.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.474
Take care of Mom, okay?

47:06.080 --> 47:07.229
Where are you gonna be?

47:09.920 --> 47:10.955
I don't know.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.394
It'll be good.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.836
Everyone'll want to
be friends with you.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.273
Come here.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.109
It's okay.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.517
I'm gonna make
everything better.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.750
And if Liffcom gets
above 200, dump it.

48:02.680 --> 48:05.990
I think we've leveled down the
energy sector, so all good there.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.200
You listening to me?

48:10.560 --> 48:11.560
What?

48:12.240 --> 48:14.231
You need to buy
a new car already.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.776
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.075
Put you in some long-term bonds.
Triple tax free.

48:18.160 --> 48:19.576
I said I didn't want
to talk about that.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.776
You'll have to
read the statements

48:20.800 --> 48:22.520
and check in with Rob
every once in a while.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.879
Mom, this is really important.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.837
No. It's not
important at all.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.576
Keep an eye
on the tech stocks.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.096
You have to watch them
closer than the others.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.680
I said I don't want
to talk about it. Okay?

48:33.040 --> 48:34.951
I don't give
a shit about any of it.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.513
I'm sorry.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.671
I'm scared.
I don't know how to...

48:59.840 --> 49:01.831
I don't know how to
do it without you.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.359
I don't know how
to be a mother.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.359
I never taught you that.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.711
You always knew
how to be a mother.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.314
You're the
best part of me, Henry.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.716
The best part of me.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.480
Can't...

50:31.920 --> 50:33.956
- Henry? What are you...
- Mommy!

50:34.400 --> 50:35.753
Baby, what are you doing?

50:35.840 --> 50:36.875
Henry? Henry?

50:36.960 --> 50:38.598
Hello? What?

50:39.040 --> 50:41.156
What's going on?
What's going on?

50:41.240 --> 50:42.296
What is it, baby,
what is it?

50:42.320 --> 50:43.799
The window.
It's okay. It's okay.

50:43.880 --> 50:44.949
I'm gonna get a doctor.

50:45.120 --> 50:46.240
What is it?
Breathe. Breathe.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.280
Mommy.
Breathe.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.753
Mom? I want Mommy.

50:48.840 --> 50:50.240
Yes. I'm here.
I am here. I am here.

50:50.280 --> 50:51.474
Mom's here.
Mommy's here.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.788
Mommy. Mommy.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.554
It's okay. Shh.
I want to see the sky.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.239
I want to see the sky.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.594
You want to see the sky?

50:58.680 --> 51:00.477
Look up. Look up, baby.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.072
Fireworks explode

51:24.160 --> 51:27.835
Front row
tickets to the show

54:07.440 --> 54:08.440
Mom?

54:14.880 --> 54:15.880
Hey.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.348
So...

54:19.520 --> 54:20.839
I had an idea.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.748
I had an idea.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.068
It's just a start,

54:25.800 --> 54:27.279
but it's something.

54:28.320 --> 54:31.471
See, we're gonna
eat dessert all week.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.955
Nothing else.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.832
Fuck it.
Don't swear in front of me.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.639
Look at this beautiful day.

54:45.760 --> 54:46.795
Mommy?

54:46.880 --> 54:49.394
You didn't expect it all
to stop for this, did you?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.797
Mom?
It's still beautiful out.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.199
Life goes on, right?
Mommy!

54:53.600 --> 54:54.600
What?

55:00.600 --> 55:02.113
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
I...

55:05.280 --> 55:07.840
I'm just having
a tough time right now.

55:08.520 --> 55:11.796
It's because when you lose
someone close to you...

55:11.880 --> 55:13.438
Don't talk to me like that.

55:14.200 --> 55:15.200
Like what?

55:15.520 --> 55:16.520
Like a child.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.560
Oh.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.800
Yeah.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Oh, God.

55:28.840 --> 55:29.840
I don't know

55:30.560 --> 55:31.560
what to do. I don't...

55:32.400 --> 55:33.400
I don't know.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.474
What would Henry do?

55:35.600 --> 55:37.113
Don't do what Henry would do.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.953
Do what you would do.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.474
What would you do?

55:42.240 --> 55:43.240
I don't know.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
Oh.

55:51.160 --> 55:52.160
Am I early?

55:52.920 --> 55:53.955
Um...

55:54.040 --> 55:56.429
I mean, we said 4:30,
but if it's not a good time, I can...

55:56.520 --> 55:57.748
No, I... I...

55:58.120 --> 55:59.348
I just forgot, and...

55:59.440 --> 56:00.736
I don't usually
make house calls,

56:00.760 --> 56:03.228
but I wanted to see
how you and Peter were doing.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.439
Thank you.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.712
Is... Is Peter home?

56:09.800 --> 56:11.552
Yeah, yeah.
Come, come in.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.679
Hey, there.
Hey.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.314
I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.320
Are you all right?

56:32.440 --> 56:33.440
No.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.040
What's wrong?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.399
My head hurts.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.229
It does?

56:40.440 --> 56:41.440
Where?

56:43.320 --> 56:44.639
Here, let me take a look.

56:49.680 --> 56:50.680
Hmm.

56:50.880 --> 56:52.711
I think your
heart hurts, kiddo.

56:53.480 --> 56:55.311
I thought my heart
was down here.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.829
I'll give you my card.

56:59.960 --> 57:02.520
It's got my
cell number on the back.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.471
If your head
hurts like that again,

57:05.840 --> 57:07.353
just give me a call.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.440
Deal?

57:10.200 --> 57:11.235
Deal.

57:21.520 --> 57:22.520
Ma'am, you work here?

57:23.040 --> 57:24.268
Excuse me.
Uh, ma'am?

57:24.480 --> 57:26.357
Hey, um, is this regular
or Diet Coke?

57:26.560 --> 57:27.834
Hmm.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.120
Diet.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.440
Susan? Uh...

57:37.880 --> 57:38.880
Can I, uh...

57:39.960 --> 57:40.960
Yeah?

57:44.360 --> 57:45.998
Maybe you came back
a little too soon.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.069
What? I'm fine.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.200
No...

57:51.080 --> 57:52.308
No, you're not fine.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.640
Uh...

57:55.720 --> 57:57.676
Your boy sent this
from the hospital.

57:58.840 --> 58:02.719
He says you have, like,
$680K in a checking account,

58:02.800 --> 58:04.870
even more in stocks
and bonds.

58:06.320 --> 58:08.709
Says in there that you can
afford to take a break.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.793
And I think you should.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
He...

58:14.000 --> 58:15.831
He was a smart kid.

58:20.280 --> 58:21.793
Look, this isn't
a request, Susan.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.280
I'm sorry.

58:35.440 --> 58:36.440
Hey!

58:39.040 --> 58:40.758
Are you...
Yeah.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.593
I'm great. I'm fine.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.830
Yeah, I've...
I've gotta run, I've...

58:47.680 --> 58:50.433
I dented the grill
on my Maserati again.

58:50.520 --> 58:51.520
Can you believe it?

58:51.600 --> 58:54.433
I had to fly a mechanic
in from Milan to, um...

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
It's a whole thing.

58:57.800 --> 59:01.190
I... I have to get
home to my two boys.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.951
Does anyone wanna
trade for a piece of fruit?

59:30.760 --> 59:32.159
Want the last cupcake?

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.074
I'm home!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880
Mom! Mom!

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240
Yeah?

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.038
I think Henry
wants us to kill Glenn.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.154
Mr. Sickleman?

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.391
"Keep in mind that not everyone
goes through all five stages,

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.552
"and you don't necessarily
go through them in order.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.071
"Each of these theories
emphasizes the vital importance

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.311
"of remaining busy
through the grieving process,

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.595
"and putting oneself to task."

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.479
I don't think the task they had
in mind was killing Glenn.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.749
Mr. Sickleman.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.629
Just turns my stomach
to think he would...

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.349
Do what? I didn't
understand it all.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.193
Uh, just not being a good
parent to Christina.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.109
I'm gonna call
Child Protective Services.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.590
"Why calling Child Protective
Services is not a plausible option."

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.709
Well, there has to be someone
else we can call to handle this.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.199
He already
tried everything.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.874
Oh, come on, Peter. There gotta
be stuff he didn't think of.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.439
Stuff Henry
didn't think of?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.273
This is ridiculous.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.148
There has to be another way
to help Christina.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.111
"Why there's no
way to help..."

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.795
I'm not having this
conversation with you.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.312
We have to.
It's Henry's dying wish.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.790
We are not murdering
the police commissioner,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.154
and that is final.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.029
I get that
the investigation is closed.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.236
That's why I'm
trying to see if...

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
Right.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.470
"Won't harass an upstanding
member of the community"?

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.878
You sure you
don't mean "powerful"?

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.751
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840
Oh, just...

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.032
Yes, I understand
that the caseworker

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.553
has to be within
the same region,

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.632
but I was just hoping to get an
outside opinion, that's all.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.216
I'm sorry,
it's out of ourjurisdiction.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.275
We are talking about...

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.056
We are required to follow
standard operating procedure.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.798
Right, but isn't there
a point where

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.711
standard procedure
is less important than...

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.520
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You can file an appeal...

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.278
Seriously?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.555
Damn it!

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.233
I love you.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200
Uh...

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.480
No...

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.590
Oh, God, sweetie... Oh, no!

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.832
Oh, God, come on.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.319
Come on.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720
Hello?

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
Glenn.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.478
Hi. Um...

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.558
I was calling because...

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.353
Because...

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.150
I'm gonna get to the leaves.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.072
Those leaves on the lawn.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Uh-huh.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.272
You've said
that before, Susan.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280
Yeah.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.398
But now, I'm on it.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.432
Hi, Mom. It's me.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.879
Breathe, Mom.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.279
Obviously, if you're listening to this,
I'm not around anymore.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.390
I'd hoped to do it all myself,
but that's not an option now.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.156
I hope you're not mad
at me for sneaking out.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.952
But, I had to make sure that
everything was taken care of.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.630
I know you rely on me, Mom.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.631
Now I have to rely on you.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.753
I need your help.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.597
Everything you
need is right here.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.037
It can't be left undone.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.112
We have to make it better.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
And Mom...

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800
Yeah?

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.071
I'll be with you
the whole time.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.149
Okay.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160
Okay.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.760
We're gonna
walk through it together, step by step.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.479
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.233
Let's start by stockpiling
some cash from ATMs.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.629
Don't act all weird.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.870
The camera's behind that
little glass square up top.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.353
Don't look.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:32.439
Good.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.872
Withdraw $500.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.555
How's that enough?

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.153
I know it doesn't
seem like enough,

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.798
but if you hit
another ATM right away,

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.519
you can get
around the daily limit.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.796
The next ATM's at
Longbow and Swan.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.154
You're gonna go right
at the intersection.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.514
Your other right.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.274
Listen, I'm sure you
have doubts about this.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.917
You think? It's goddamn
insane is what it is, Henry.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.629
Good. Get all your swearing out,
not in front of Peter.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.760
- It's a bad influence.
- It's a bad influence.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.429
Park across the street
behind the green dumpster.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.791
You came here?

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
Jesus.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.354
I'm the worst parent
ever.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.752
Remember the security camera's
field of vision.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.471
It's in the diagram.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.200
Mom...

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.153
You got this.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.955
I need a Nemesis Vanquish 7.62

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.871
with a Litton Ranger
Night Vision scope,

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.712
a suppressor, and three extra
10-round detachable mags.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.680
Think you can handle that or should
I take my business elsewhere?

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.116
Suppressors are
illegal for civilian use.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.913
Let's see what Domenic has
to say about that, huh?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.273
Yeah. Domenic.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.912
Look, chief,
all due respect,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.752
I got a plane to catch,

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.156
so why don't you just name your price,
and I'll get out of your hair?

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.632
Plywood is only slightly
thicker than the human skull.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.752
And these rounds
fragment on impact,

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.390
making them pretty
much untraceable.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.557
Slow, steady
pressure on the trigger.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.718
You see that?
Good job, Mom.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.080
You're getting there.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.358
At first, I couldn't
imagine doing this,

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.676
but then I see
that look in her eyes,

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.150
like she's still in there.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.192
Barely hanging on.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.516
Nice shot, Mom.
Look at that grouping.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.673
Now make sure you collect the
shells before you get out...

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.469
Need anything?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.913
I'm good.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.912
Well, don't burn anything down.
Remember that electrical fire.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.111
Waffle irons are tricky.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
Hey, Glenn.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.800
Hey, Susan.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.356
I'm sorry I haven't, uh...

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.112
Oh, no, don't, uh...

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.394
Um...

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.077
About your son, I, um...

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.240
Yeah, thanks.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.598
Look, I was, uh... I was
hoping to get your advice

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.478
on something that
I'm trying to deal with.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760
Oh.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.309
Do you mind?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.274
Hey, sweetie.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840
How are you?

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.440
How's school?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800
Fine.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Except math.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.995
It'll get easier. Soon.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520
Susan?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.431
Uh, yeah, so, with everything that's
been going on this last month,

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.760
I, uh...

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.430
Well, it's got me thinking,

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.988
if God forbid something
were to happen to me,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.877
being a single parent,

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.276
I want to have arrangements
made for where Peter would go.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.711
Do you have anything
like that set up?

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
Well, I'm...

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.159
I'm pretty healthy.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.393
I try to stay fit, um...

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.430
Guess there's always
the proverbial bus.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.389
But, um...

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.920
No, I...

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.030
I've never really given it
much thought, you know?

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.594
Even after Christina's
mother passed away?

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.840
Nope.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.393
Can't offer

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
much, um,

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.233
on that front.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.360
Uh, why?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.591
Just, you know,
your line of work.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.596
You guys seem to have
all your ducks in a row.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.751
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I can't be much help.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320
Mmm.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.760
What's that?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.280
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot...

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.200
I, uh, need you to sign off
on the talent show night

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.633
if I'm gonna take Christina.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.749
You know how Cavalry
Elementary loves their forms.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960
Yeah.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520
Okay.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400
Great.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.637
So, I'll pick her up tomorrow.
Okay.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.912
Around 6:00?
Yeah.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.033
Witnesses are required
for guardianship papers.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.600
So, I backdated them
and forged

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.837
Miss Schwartz from up the block's
signature, since she died last year.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.676
Mmm. Poor Mrs. Schwartz
from up the block.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.320
Also,
I bought a new car for you.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.595
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.874
I know, I know.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.151
But it's safer, and it'll make a
less conspicuous getaway car.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.999
You just need to pick it up.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.877
The address is in my notebook.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960
Fine.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160
Mom?

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.840
Oh, hey, honey.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.273
What are you doing?

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.999
I was just, uh, finishing
up on some work here.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.388
Okay... Let's
get you back to bed.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.239
You ready for tomorrow?

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.553
The big talent show?

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200
Kind of.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.514
What are you gonna do?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.874
A magic trick.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.150
A magic trick.
Wow.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.033
What's it gonna be?

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.473
It's a surprise.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.913
Sounds exciting.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:07.988
What if it doesn't work?

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.630
Well, you prepared
for it, right?

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.153
Yeah. A lot.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.920
Mrs. Ramirez even
let me use the art lab.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.031
Well, then you
shouldn't be nervous.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.553
You've laid down
the groundwork,

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.914
and when it comes
to the time,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.230
you'll just have to trust
it'll all go smoothly.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.868
If Henry did it, there'd
be nothing to worry about.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.960
It'd be perfect.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.755
Baby...

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.196
What? Tell me.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.196
Sometimes I think it
should have been me.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.834
No.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.473
How can you say that?

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.391
People would be
less sad, then.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.794
Listen to me.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.229
If anything
happened to you...

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840
I...

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.070
I don't know what I'd do.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.278
Henry was amazing...

01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.829
But you...

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.439
You're just as special.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.395
And the fact that you think
you're any less important to me,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.516
isn't just wrong, it's...

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.036
It's stupendously wrong.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.275
Okay?

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.190
Everything has to
be timed to the second.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.039
Every movement, every
angle, every footstep.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.236
There's no room for error.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.119
This never happened.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.038
You were never here.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.192
Not even here now.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.629
You're a ghost.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.949
Like you.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.309
Peter!

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.989
Come on, let's move it!
It's your big night!

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040
Hey...

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.918
You're gonna play it cool
up there on stage, right?

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.073
And there's no need to panic, 'cause
panic never got anyone anywhere.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.678
Just stay focused, stay calm,

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.710
and remember your
Lamaze breathing.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Good?

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200
Okay.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.633
Don't be nervous.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.472
It's gonna be great.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.676
Peter, what are you doing?

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.795
Why would you do that?

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.677
Henry would've
thought it was funny.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.879
Henry was 11.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.188
He was a genius.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.072
But he wasn't a parent.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480
Okay?

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.880
Come on.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.560
Hey.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680
Hi, uh...

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.513
Hi, I, um...

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.277
There you are,
all surprising-like.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.474
I invited him. I wanted
him to see my trick.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.751
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520
Uh...

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.359
I hope, uh...

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.840
Is this okay?

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.911
Yeah, sure. No problem.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.160
But, um...

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.189
I have to be
a parent volunteer tonight.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.633
So, um, I'll have
parent volunteer things.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.720
Okay.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.909
Uh...

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.598
I'll just, um...

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.953
You okay?
Yeah.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.792
Yeah? You look great.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.711
Don't be nervous.
I won't.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.119
I'll be watching you.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280
Peter?

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160
Peter.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.833
Good evening, parents.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.599
The students are ready.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.716
I am so proud of these kids.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.519
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.991
welcome to the Cavalry
Elementary School Talent Show!

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.480
You gonna step to me?
I kick you in the knees

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.711
I'm the baddest, meanest mad dog
mother you're ever gonna see

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.439
Blink twice, you miss me
Chicks, they try to kiss me

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.476
Suckers,
they see me and flee me

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.518
After I kick 'em in the
shorts, get lost dorks

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.831
'Cause you're all tidbits
But me, I'm the shiznits

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.600
Okay, Mom, this is it.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.279
On my three.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.555
One, two...

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880
Three.

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.110
C-A-V-A...

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480
R-Y!

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.914
Don't panic.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.353
No matter what, don't panic.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.555
I'm not panicking.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.558
This is for my sister.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.680
A.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760
B.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080
C.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
D.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:51.110
Amazing grace

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:56.511
How sweet the sound

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:03.430
That saved a wretch

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.310
Like me

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.791
I once was lost

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.313
But now I'm found

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.200
Time check.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.633
37. 12.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.031
Line your body up with
the rifle to reduce recoil.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.830
Wait till he's exactly
where you need him.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.350
Eliminate all distractions.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880
Shit.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.719
Even trigger pressure.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.879
Remember your training.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Smooth exhale.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.149
Don't tense up.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240
Steady, Mom.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760
Steady...

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.119
Mom, take the shot.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.108
Do it! Now!

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.560
No.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640
No.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.352
You're just a child.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.760
What the hell
is going on here?

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.199
I know what you've done.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.031
Emergency room visits,

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.357
school absences,

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.079
bruises,

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.154
calls to
Child Protective Services

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.073
that all just got swept under
the rug by your brother.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.757
Henry documented all of it.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.274
And you never even
knew he was watching.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.433
Who you think
they're gonna believe?

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.478
I don't know, Glenn.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.749
I can afford a scandal.
How about you?

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.876
I'm gonna call my chief,

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.949
have him bring you in.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.834
Whatever happens to me
won't change what you are.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.831
I will go to the FBI.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.952
I will go
to the newspapers.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.875
I will make sure that you never lay
a hand on that little girl again.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.638
And I will make you answer
for what you've done.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.949
Look at me.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.233
Look at me!

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.794
I want you to see who
you're up against now.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.200
That can't be right.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.040
Oh, my God.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.239
Hey, Stan.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.035
Hey.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.429
It's Glenn.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.520
Um...

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.956
Listen, I need you
to handle something for me.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.234
Um...

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.071
You're gonna hear some

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.637
insane, uh,

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.016
accusations, you know, so...

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.190
I know, Glenn.
We got a call.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.354
What do you mean?

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880
A call?

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.720
From who?

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.398
The school principal.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.352
We heard from the district.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.958
It's too wide, Glenn.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.230
We're gonna have
to open up a case.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.957
And now,
introducing Peter the Great.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.799
For my magic trick

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.599
I'm going to make
my brother reappear.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.954
When I'm done, he's gonna be
here, right among all of us.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.555
Please work.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.515
You know, as a scientist,
I never believed in magic.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.273
But after that, well...

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.069
Peter the Great.
Dr. Daniels.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520
Um...

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Will I see you soon?

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.433
I hope so.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440
Uh...

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.676
Do you mind
watching him for a second?

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.880
Of course not.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.232
I'll be right back, sweetie.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.628
What happened?

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.634
Glenn Sickleman
took his life tonight.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.479
Oh, my God.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.910
The social worker asked to see
Christina alone for a moment.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.800
Oh, sweetie...

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.154
In the best interest
of the minor child,

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:33.312
the court hereby orders that
permanent custody be awarded

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.472
to Susan Carpenter,
effective immediately.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.031
Sometimes a good
story will remind you

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.678
of who you want to be.

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.875
Maybe that's why
there are so many.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.716
Stories about good and evil,

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.313
stories about the triumph
of the human spirit,

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.994
stories about
living and dying,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.833
and how you got to do one
in spite of the other.

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:07.829
Well, this story,

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.911
it's about you and
me and my brother,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.956
and the girl who
lived next door.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.310
But it's not
my story anymore.

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.109
It's yours.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.789
"One by one, its petals
dropped to the ground,

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.431
"and then the leaves, and then
the bud, and then the stalk,

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.432
"until it seemed
the flower was gone.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.919
"But it wasn't...

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.232
"Because the flower
melted into the soil

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.757
"and made it rich so the
whole garden could grow.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.079
"The end."

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.715
I loved it.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.915
I loved it, too.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.399
Thank you.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.429
Okay, let's get you into bed.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.640
You're okay?

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.794
I'm almost finished
painting your room.

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.233
It'll be awesome.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.151
Good night,
enchilada number one.

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.838
Good night, butterfly.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:09.520
On or off?

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.720
On.
On.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.319
Open or closed?

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560
Closed.
Closed.

01:41:17.305 --> 01:41:23.650
