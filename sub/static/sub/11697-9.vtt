00:01.333 --> 00:03.635
I'm telling you, Emma.
A little sun,

00:03.669 --> 00:06.337
a little surf,
a little cold one--

00:06.372 --> 00:08.439
life does not get
any better than this.

00:09.608 --> 00:12.310
Hello? Sorry I'm late.
My flip-flops

00:12.344 --> 00:13.611
flopped out
around 14th.

00:15.347 --> 00:17.281
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Wheeler beach,

00:17.447 --> 00:19.781
where strangers don't ask you
to rub lotion on their back.

00:20.747 --> 00:24.050
Snow cones? One of the benefits
of never de-frosting the freezer.

00:24.052 --> 00:25.786
Listen...

00:25.821 --> 00:27.788
Your current
flavor choices include

00:27.823 --> 00:28.956
beer

00:28.990 --> 00:29.990
or ketchup.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.728
I recommend the combo.

00:33.762 --> 00:36.664
Oh, I thought we were going
to the real beach.

00:36.698 --> 00:39.667
You know, where I get to ask
strangers to rub lotion on my back.

00:39.701 --> 00:42.002
We were. Unfortunately,
I got called into work.

00:42.037 --> 00:43.671
But it's the hottest day
of the year.

00:43.705 --> 00:46.607
What kind of crazy person
is even gonna be out?

00:46.641 --> 00:48.709
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

00:48.744 --> 00:50.878
Are you all ready
to revive

00:50.912 --> 00:53.013
a cherished Wheeler
family tradition?

00:53.048 --> 00:55.783
All right!
Pancake-eating contest!

00:56.985 --> 01:00.588
No. The annual
Christmas card photo.

01:00.622 --> 01:01.756
It was Benji's idea.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.724
Whoo!
Family photo!

01:05.861 --> 01:08.529
There really is just no way
to make that sound exciting.

01:08.563 --> 01:11.532
Yeah. Because Mom used
to dress us up like reindeer

01:11.566 --> 01:13.667
and make us look
like idiots.

01:13.702 --> 01:14.835
I know. But now
that Emma's here,

01:14.870 --> 01:15.936
I wanna dress her up
like a reindeer

01:15.971 --> 01:17.571
and make <i>her</i> look
like an idiot.

01:18.707 --> 01:20.608
Aww, I always loved
that card.

01:20.642 --> 01:21.909
It was the highlight
of the season.

01:21.943 --> 01:22.977
Thank you, Riley.

01:23.011 --> 01:26.013
We put it on our fridge,
and laughed...

01:27.949 --> 01:31.786
In admiration
whenever we saw it.

01:31.820 --> 01:34.622
Well, I'm glad you liked it
because you're gonna be in it.

01:34.656 --> 01:36.023
You too, Tuck.
This is about family

01:36.057 --> 01:37.758
and you're both part
of Emma's family now.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.026
Well, God knows
she needs a new one

01:39.060 --> 01:40.928
since your father
blew up the old one.

01:41.462 --> 01:43.898
Ooh, beer cone! Mm.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.802
I actually just finished
cutting his fat head out

01:47.836 --> 01:48.969
of all of our albums.

01:49.504 --> 01:51.839
But you guys got divorced
over three years ago.

01:51.873 --> 01:53.774
Yeah, well, I spent the first two
years trying to ruin his credit.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.042
And then I just
kind of landed on this.

01:56.845 --> 01:57.878
Hey, Tuck.

01:57.913 --> 01:59.647
As the newest member
of the Wheeler clan,

01:59.681 --> 02:01.682
any way I can talk you
into taking my mom's car

02:01.716 --> 02:03.584
out to Jersey tomorrow
to pick up the costumes?

02:03.618 --> 02:05.753
Oh, you know
I don't really drive.

02:05.787 --> 02:07.822
Oh, I do! I'll drive.
Can I do it?

02:07.856 --> 02:09.622
I'm a new member too.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.560
Well, why can't I go?
What's going on?

02:12.594 --> 02:14.562
Well, you know how
it wouldn't be Christmas

02:14.596 --> 02:16.730
- without Santa?
- But Dad was always Santa!

02:18.834 --> 02:21.702
And his sleigh lands
tomorrow morning.

02:21.736 --> 02:23.971
Your father
is coming to town?!

02:24.005 --> 02:25.773
Merry Christmas!

02:28.910 --> 02:31.879

02:38.954 --> 02:40.754
Okay, Mom, Dad will
be here any minute.

02:40.789 --> 02:42.756
And I'm begging you--
one weekend,

02:42.791 --> 02:44.758
one photo,
no fighting.

02:44.793 --> 02:46.894
Hey, I'm not the one
you need to worry about.

02:46.928 --> 02:48.896
I have moved on.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.732
Ray Wheeler is just
a speed bump in

02:51.766 --> 02:53.634
my rearview mirror.

02:53.668 --> 02:54.969
I wouldn't mind slamming
the car in reverse

02:55.003 --> 02:55.970
- and backing up--
- Mom!

02:56.004 --> 02:57.972
All right.

02:58.006 --> 02:59.874
Danny, back me up here.

02:59.908 --> 03:02.610
Dude, there are some things in life
you just don't get in between.

03:02.644 --> 03:04.778
a bear and its cub,
a zombie and a brain,

03:04.813 --> 03:05.913
and Mom and Dad fighting.

03:07.682 --> 03:08.816
<i>That's him!</i>

03:08.850 --> 03:09.817
Mom, remember--

03:09.851 --> 03:10.818
How he crushed my soul

03:10.852 --> 03:11.919
and left my ego for dead?

03:11.953 --> 03:14.555
Distant memory. Okay?

03:15.557 --> 03:16.957
- Dad!
- Ben Ben!

03:16.992 --> 03:18.659
Oh!

03:18.693 --> 03:19.960
Oh, you're looking good
as always.

03:19.995 --> 03:22.630
- Hey, Dad!
- Dan the man!

03:22.664 --> 03:23.964
- Think fast!
- Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

03:26.868 --> 03:28.903
There she is.

03:28.937 --> 03:31.705
Oh!

03:31.740 --> 03:34.675
Hi. Hi.

03:34.709 --> 03:36.911
I think we know where she gets
her good looks from, huh?

03:40.649 --> 03:43.584
There's a sound I haven't
missed once.

03:43.618 --> 03:45.052
Grab the baby.

03:47.022 --> 03:48.689
Bonnie.

03:49.691 --> 03:50.858
Ray.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.035 --> 04:02.870
Wow! Would you
look at us?

04:02.904 --> 04:04.705
Just one big happy
family.

04:04.739 --> 04:05.940
So Dad, how's business?

04:05.974 --> 04:06.941
Good. Good.

04:06.975 --> 04:08.509
I got three homes
going up.

04:08.543 --> 04:09.843
Oh, that's ironic.

04:09.878 --> 04:12.613
I thought your specialty
was wrecking them.

04:12.647 --> 04:15.616
Just the old broken-down ones.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.785
Dad, come on.
You said you weren't go there.

04:17.819 --> 04:19.954
Go where?
Mid-life crisis island?

04:19.988 --> 04:22.990
Too late! I heard you
were just elected mayor!

04:23.024 --> 04:24.992
You know what
you should try? Yoga.

04:25.026 --> 04:26.594
I've been doing it
twice a week.

04:26.628 --> 04:27.661
I can actually touch
my toes.

04:27.696 --> 04:28.996
Oh. Well, that should
make it easier

04:29.030 --> 04:30.564
for you to pull
your head outta your--

04:30.599 --> 04:32.566
Mom!

04:32.601 --> 04:33.801
What?

04:33.835 --> 04:35.769
You didn't know where
I was going with that.

04:36.938 --> 04:37.938
Ass!

04:40.408 --> 04:42.610
Okay? Maybe you did.
Just--

04:44.879 --> 04:45.846
Seriously?

04:45.880 --> 04:48.782
Who has 14 boxes
of Christmas costumes?

04:48.817 --> 04:50.951
Even Jesus would
call this overkill.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.686
Okay. Well, then
make yourself useful

04:52.721 --> 04:53.854
and find us a good one.

04:53.888 --> 04:55.656
I wanna be something
naughty and nice.

04:55.690 --> 04:56.991
Okay.

04:57.025 --> 04:59.793
We've got a-- a box
full of random beards.

05:00.862 --> 05:03.731
Some assorted angel
paraphernalia.

05:03.765 --> 05:05.833
Oh! Halo!

05:07.569 --> 05:08.669
What's over here?

05:08.703 --> 05:11.839
Oh! And a box full
of Danny's old schoolwork?

05:11.873 --> 05:13.941
So Riley...

05:13.975 --> 05:16.510
When I said,
"hey, check the boxes,"

05:16.544 --> 05:18.946
I kinda meant,
"hey, check the boxes!"

05:18.980 --> 05:21.749
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was too busy ignoring you.

05:21.783 --> 05:23.884
Oh, but wait!

05:23.918 --> 05:25.886
What do we have here?

05:25.920 --> 05:28.722
The journal of one Mr.

05:28.757 --> 05:30.624
Daniel J. Wheeler.

05:30.659 --> 05:34.595
Oh my God! Aww, that was
our senior class project.

05:35.697 --> 05:37.731
Should we read it?
Is that like totally wrong?

05:39.834 --> 05:41.969
Oh, I'm sorry. What were you saying?
I was reading.

05:42.003 --> 05:44.638
Tucker, if you're gonna
invade someone's privacy,

05:44.673 --> 05:46.774
at least have the decency
to read it out loud.

05:50.679 --> 05:52.546
Hey, you got room
for one more out here?

05:52.580 --> 05:53.714
Look, Ray, I'm sorry.

05:53.748 --> 05:56.650
But I just can't pretend
that I'm happy to see you.

05:56.685 --> 05:57.885
Well, I could.

05:57.919 --> 05:59.553
But then they'd
have to give me an award,

05:59.587 --> 06:00.621
and I'd have
to write a speech

06:00.655 --> 06:01.722
and you know,
who's got the time?!

06:03.692 --> 06:04.792
I just wanna have
a conversation.

06:04.826 --> 06:06.493
Well, whatever it is,
I don't want to hear it.

06:06.528 --> 06:07.561
I want to apologize.

06:07.595 --> 06:08.595
Go on.

06:09.964 --> 06:11.765
You deserved better.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.767
I was going through a lot and
I was taking it out on you.

06:13.802 --> 06:15.703
And I'm sorry.

06:15.737 --> 06:17.538
But I gotta say, seeing
how good you look--

06:17.572 --> 06:19.673
it makes me feel
a lot better.

06:19.708 --> 06:22.776
You think I look good?

06:22.811 --> 06:24.678
Yeah, I think you
look fantastic.

06:24.713 --> 06:28.682
Apparently having me a thousand
miles away is good for you.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.784
I don't know
if it's that.

06:30.819 --> 06:32.820
Or just that I've been
drinking more water.

06:35.657 --> 06:37.791
Hey, what do you say you and I spend
a little quality time together?

06:37.826 --> 06:39.693
You know, without
the k-i-ds.

06:44.799 --> 06:45.966
You still happy
we stopped at two?

06:46.034 --> 06:47.601
Ecstatic.

06:48.603 --> 06:49.903
But the new one
shows promise.

06:49.938 --> 06:52.673
I'm babysitting her
tonight.

06:52.707 --> 06:53.741
And they didn't tell me

06:53.775 --> 06:56.009
that I couldn't invite
any boys over.

06:57.679 --> 06:58.946
So do you want
to join?

06:58.980 --> 07:01.749
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a date.

07:01.783 --> 07:03.884
I've missed you,
Bonnie.

07:10.825 --> 07:14.862
So? Huh?
Well? See?

07:14.896 --> 07:16.797
I don't know.

07:16.831 --> 07:19.600
Call me crazy, but I
think that your father

07:19.634 --> 07:21.668
is looking to move
back to Bonnie town!

07:23.605 --> 07:24.638
Oh, wait wait wait.

07:24.672 --> 07:25.939
I think we might
finally have something.

07:27.675 --> 07:30.711
Oh, there's a whole
section about a secret crush.

07:30.745 --> 07:32.713
It looks like
the big guy was in love.

07:32.747 --> 07:34.548
Oh yeah-- no.

07:34.582 --> 07:36.550
Trust me, if there's
anything I know about Danny

07:36.584 --> 07:37.651
it's that he
was never in love.

07:37.685 --> 07:39.653
Yeah, tell that
to girl "X."

07:39.687 --> 07:41.655
Girl "X"?
Who's girl "X"?

07:41.689 --> 07:44.625
Oh, I'm sensing that
might be a code.

07:44.659 --> 07:45.993
What?

07:46.027 --> 07:49.596
Yeah, I guess he checked her out
every day at field hockey practice.

07:49.631 --> 07:51.665
There is no way!
I played field hockey.

07:51.699 --> 07:53.834
We made fun of
every girl on that team.

07:53.868 --> 07:55.669
Wait.

07:55.703 --> 07:56.870
You were on
the field hockey team?

07:56.905 --> 07:57.905
Yeah.

07:59.641 --> 08:00.908
Okay, keep reading.
We gotta figure this out.

08:00.942 --> 08:02.509
Oh no, that's it.
The end.

08:02.544 --> 08:03.677
When I said section
I just meant those two lines.

08:03.711 --> 08:04.678
Oh, give it to me.

08:04.712 --> 08:06.713
Oh! Oops!

08:08.950 --> 08:10.818
Now look what you
have done.

08:10.852 --> 08:12.853
Now we'll never know.

08:18.626 --> 08:20.661
You and Mom... so?

08:20.695 --> 08:23.864
Huh? Well? See?

08:23.898 --> 08:25.966
Look, I'm not gonna lie,
it was really good to see her.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.801
Look, I don't wanna be
one of those

08:27.836 --> 08:29.703
"maybe mommy and daddy
are getting back together"

08:29.737 --> 08:31.772
kids, but...

08:31.806 --> 08:33.874
Maybe mommy and daddy
are getting back together?

08:33.908 --> 08:35.609
Is that what
you were thinking?

08:35.643 --> 08:37.878
I'm sorry, that is not
gonna happen.

08:37.912 --> 08:40.514
I'm actually
seeing someone.

08:40.548 --> 08:42.515
Now? Just when you
and Mom are about

08:42.549 --> 08:43.650
to get back together?

08:43.684 --> 08:45.686
I'm sure she'll understand.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.754
Dad, no! You cannot tell Mom
you're in a relationship!

08:47.789 --> 08:50.591
At least not until after the
Christmas photo. Please!

08:50.625 --> 08:52.659
She will not be happy
about your happiness.

08:53.895 --> 08:56.797
You know, unlike me,
who's very happy for you.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.666
I'm sorry.

08:59.701 --> 09:00.934
What's her name?

09:02.537 --> 09:04.805
His name is Steve.

09:06.574 --> 09:08.742
That's... weird.

09:10.545 --> 09:12.679
'Cause you said Steve and
that's usually a boy's name.

09:12.714 --> 09:14.781
And then you said "his."

09:19.988 --> 09:21.989
Ben, I'm gay.

09:27.008 --> 09:28.189
Okay...

09:28.190 --> 09:29.262
Wow! Really?

09:29.263 --> 09:31.298
Probably could have eased
into that a little more.

09:31.332 --> 09:34.401
I'm sorry. I saw an opening and
I just kind of went for it.

09:35.835 --> 09:37.370
Are you sure?

09:38.005 --> 09:40.807
Sure enough that I'm living
with a guy named Steve.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.141
But what about
you and Mom?

09:42.176 --> 09:44.077
Ben, I loved your Mom.

09:44.111 --> 09:46.145
Being with her was like
driving a great car.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.082
And then one day that car throws
your suitcase out on the front lawn,

09:49.116 --> 09:51.150
so you get on a plane,
and you realize...

09:51.185 --> 09:53.152
Holy cow!

09:53.187 --> 09:55.788
I'm a pilot.

09:58.509 --> 10:01.811
Along with your delivery, you might
wanna work on your analogies.

10:01.846 --> 10:03.813
They say the first time you
talk to someone is the hardest,

10:03.848 --> 10:05.815
so when I talk to your mother
and your brother, I'm sure--

10:05.850 --> 10:06.883
Oh, no no no no no!

10:06.917 --> 10:08.718
You cannot tell Mom
or Danny.

10:08.752 --> 10:11.888
At least not now.
I've got a happy family photo to take,

10:11.922 --> 10:15.592
and just because gay means happy,
it doesn't mean they will be.

10:15.626 --> 10:17.493
I just hate to be dishonest.

10:17.528 --> 10:19.629
Dad, it's only dishonest
if someone asks.

10:19.663 --> 10:21.865
And trust me,
no one is gonna ask.

10:21.899 --> 10:24.701
Ask what?

10:24.735 --> 10:26.803
How quickly we can
change the subject?

10:26.837 --> 10:29.739
I have a friend who's
thinking about coming out.

10:29.773 --> 10:31.741
To visit?

10:31.775 --> 10:33.476
Of the closet.

10:33.510 --> 10:34.811
Why is he in--

10:35.245 --> 10:37.513
Oh... that closet.
Got it!

10:38.048 --> 10:40.516
But he's not ready
to come out yet.

10:40.551 --> 10:41.651
Actually, I think he is.

10:41.685 --> 10:43.620
What's the big deal?
If he's gay, he's gay.

10:43.654 --> 10:45.855
It just means more
ladies for me.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.824
See? Totally on board.

10:47.858 --> 10:49.492
But if your friend's
gay today,

10:49.526 --> 10:50.827
he'll probably still
be gay tomorrow.

10:50.861 --> 10:52.896
Say, after 5:00?

10:52.930 --> 10:54.898
I'm not exactly sure
how that works,

10:54.932 --> 10:57.500
but I think he's right.

10:57.534 --> 10:58.735
All right, it's cool.
He's waited this long,

10:58.769 --> 11:00.503
I'm sure he can wait
another day.

11:00.537 --> 11:01.604
Thank you.

11:07.511 --> 11:10.480
I'm pretty I know
who your friend is.

11:10.514 --> 11:11.614
You do?

11:12.783 --> 11:14.651
And you're okay
with that?

11:14.685 --> 11:15.752
Yeah, I'm okay.

11:15.786 --> 11:17.654
Oh, that's great.

11:17.688 --> 11:18.821
That is so great.

11:20.691 --> 11:21.824
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna take this.

11:21.859 --> 11:23.927
Let's just keep this
between us for now.

11:23.961 --> 11:26.629
Ben's worried if your mother
finds out she's gonna freak.

11:26.664 --> 11:28.665
- Totally. It's our secret.
- Thank you.

11:33.804 --> 11:35.838
Hey, bro, just know...

11:35.873 --> 11:37.874
I'll always love you.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.615
Thanks.

11:45.649 --> 11:47.817
But you're still gonna
have to pay for this beer.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.555
Hey, Wheeler!
You home?

11:52.589 --> 11:53.957
I got a couple
♪ questions.

11:53.991 --> 11:55.725
Oh, and I've got
some answers.

11:55.759 --> 11:57.660
Boxes in the back.
Riley out the door.

11:58.996 --> 12:01.831
Wow, don't think I'm gonna
make a habit of this,

12:01.865 --> 12:03.666
but you look beautiful.

12:03.701 --> 12:05.802
Thanks.
You look sweaty.

12:06.837 --> 12:07.837
Listen, Riley,

12:07.871 --> 12:10.740
I need the advice
of a girlfriend.

12:10.774 --> 12:12.842
And, well, you're here,

12:12.876 --> 12:14.777
so...

12:14.812 --> 12:18.815
What would you say if Ray
and I got back together?

12:18.849 --> 12:21.651
Well, if you're
really asking my advice...

12:21.685 --> 12:24.454
I think it's a truly
horrible idea.

12:24.488 --> 12:26.556
So what you're saying is

12:26.590 --> 12:28.725
I should liquor him up,
and then break out

12:28.759 --> 12:31.461
a few of my
seductive charms.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.663
Yeah, that's actually the
opposite of what I was saying.

12:33.697 --> 12:34.897
I know, but I didn't
like what you said.

12:37.968 --> 12:39.569
Grandpa reporting
for duty.

12:39.603 --> 12:40.737
Hi.

12:40.771 --> 12:42.839
- Fatpants?!
- Right?!

12:42.873 --> 12:44.741
Oh my God!
Look at you!

12:44.775 --> 12:45.742
Who knew that

12:45.776 --> 12:49.512
this was hidden
inside all that?

12:49.546 --> 12:51.614
Really nice to see
you again, Mr. Wheeler.

12:51.648 --> 12:53.716
You guys have
a good night.

12:53.751 --> 12:56.552
Boom boom boom boom boom.

12:56.587 --> 12:59.622
Oddly made for each other.

13:02.659 --> 13:03.893
Wait! You read
my journal?

13:03.927 --> 13:05.528
What's wrong with you?!

13:05.562 --> 13:07.864
What? Stay with me.
Okay?

13:07.898 --> 13:09.732
Riley knows about
girl "X."

13:09.767 --> 13:11.768
You broke my code?

13:11.802 --> 13:14.604
No, I called up
my three-year-old nephew

13:14.638 --> 13:16.606
and he broke it.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.441
But Riley has not, okay?

13:18.475 --> 13:20.443
So you've got yourself
two options:

13:20.477 --> 13:22.879
One, finally man up and admit
that you've been in love with her

13:22.913 --> 13:24.447
after all
these years.

13:24.481 --> 13:25.882
Or, you can--

13:25.916 --> 13:27.450
or you can just hide.

13:27.484 --> 13:29.786
Where did you
g-- oh!

13:29.820 --> 13:31.521
Hi.

13:31.555 --> 13:33.556
Do you who your brother
was in love with in high school?

13:33.590 --> 13:35.825
Yeah. Himself.

13:37.561 --> 13:39.562
I think they're
still together.

13:39.596 --> 13:40.696
Well, do you know
where he is?

13:40.731 --> 13:42.698
I'm gonna give him
such grief.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.867
Yeah, I think he's
over there with my--

13:44.902 --> 13:46.803
where's my dad?

13:46.837 --> 13:50.940
♪ I know something
you don't know. ♪

13:51.974 --> 13:53.776
Guarantee I know
a whole lot more.

13:53.811 --> 13:56.546
Do you know your folks
might be getting back together?

13:56.580 --> 14:00.850
Already been down that path, and it does
not lead to happiness and rainbows.

14:00.884 --> 14:02.618
Well, maybe a rainbow.

14:04.888 --> 14:06.589
Well, then someone should
probably tell your mom

14:06.623 --> 14:09.625
because she is about
to launch a full-on assault.

14:09.660 --> 14:11.894
- Right now?
- Yeah.

14:11.929 --> 14:13.930
I gotta go!
Hey, cover for me!

14:16.467 --> 14:18.434
Wait wait wait wait.
You remember when we stole

14:18.469 --> 14:19.769
all the neighbors'
garden gnomes?

14:19.803 --> 14:22.672
And then that
crazy Johnnie Haskell

14:22.706 --> 14:23.706
from across the street

14:23.740 --> 14:25.775
demanded to search
our garage.

14:25.809 --> 14:27.477
That's right.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.545
Oh my gosh, how did we get
ourselves out of that?

14:29.580 --> 14:31.781
We blamed the boys and
grounded them for a week.

14:32.883 --> 14:35.718
Those kids do come in
handy sometimes.

14:35.752 --> 14:37.520
Oh, and do you remember

14:37.554 --> 14:40.923
how Johnnie always used to work
out in his yard shirtless?

14:40.958 --> 14:42.658
Yeah.

14:42.693 --> 14:45.461
Yeah, I remember.

14:47.598 --> 14:48.898
Are you okay?

14:48.932 --> 14:50.666
Yeah, I'm great.
I just feel

14:50.701 --> 14:52.502
like I need to talk
to you about something.

14:52.536 --> 14:54.637
Ray, it's your bonbon.

14:54.671 --> 14:55.805
You can tell me anything.

14:55.839 --> 14:57.707
I was gonna wait until
after the picture tomorrow

14:57.741 --> 14:59.609
'cause I didn't want it
to get too awkward, but--

14:59.643 --> 15:01.744
Well, I think you'll
find that I am...

15:01.778 --> 15:03.713
Fairly receptive.

15:05.816 --> 15:07.550
- Bonnie.
- Mm-hmm.

15:10.554 --> 15:12.522
I'm sorry.
I just can't.

15:12.556 --> 15:17.593
Well, maybe you just
need a little inspiration.

15:17.628 --> 15:18.728
Welcome to Bonnie town!

15:18.762 --> 15:19.795
Bonnie!

15:19.830 --> 15:21.664
Oh God!

15:21.698 --> 15:22.765
Oh...

15:22.799 --> 15:24.433
Oh! Oh!

15:24.468 --> 15:26.836
This is gonna cost
so much in therapy.

15:26.870 --> 15:27.870
Oh God!

15:31.470 --> 15:33.448
And that is
how you cool off

15:33.449 --> 15:35.483
during a heat wave.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.303
Honestly, Ben,
don't you ever knock?

15:38.337 --> 15:40.438
Sorry I keep forgetting
it's my apartment!

15:40.473 --> 15:43.575
Well, okay, but if you could just
grab whatever it is you needed, and--

15:43.609 --> 15:45.577
So what's the plan?
Hide from her

15:45.611 --> 15:47.579
- for the rest of your life?
- Well, how hard can it be?

15:47.613 --> 15:48.746
It's not like she comes over that much.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.716
- Riley's coming over.
- Quick! Back to the bar!

15:51.750 --> 15:53.718
Hey, that's a great idea.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.420
Wheeler men bonding
at the bar.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.388
Wheeler women bonding at the
apartment-- let's go, Dad!

15:57.423 --> 15:58.556
Nothing like a night out
with the boys.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.325
- And by boys, I mean--
- She's got it, Dad, yep!

16:05.564 --> 16:07.298
I don't know which
one you are,

16:07.333 --> 16:10.268
but you're definitely the
cutest reindeer of them all.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.703
When did I become
one of those parents?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.508
Probably two seconds after I saw
you in those little antlers.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.511
Okay, Santa baby,
let's move it along.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.279
Christmas is just
around the corner

16:21.313 --> 16:23.381
and so is my next break.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.483
Yeah, we'll just be
another minute.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.387
Well, what do you think?

16:29.421 --> 16:31.356
Does your dad
look like a wise man?

16:31.390 --> 16:33.458
Wiser than you did
last night.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.461
Yeah, that probably wasn't the
best time to come out to your mom.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.629
You know what?
I think I'll do it the old-fashioned way

16:37.663 --> 16:39.464
and just blurt it out
at Thanksgiving.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.570
And the Christmas angel
is upon us.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.574
Hey, maybe later
we can ditch the fat man

16:49.608 --> 16:51.643
and you can try
to tarnish my halo.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.711
Okay, Mom.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.346
- You'll be standing over here.
- I know, but I was--

16:55.381 --> 16:56.581
- W-way-- way over here.
- Okay, all right.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.583
Okay, this isn't
a social, people.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.485
Let's shake
our tinsel makers

17:00.519 --> 17:02.253
and get a move on.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.622
Okay, guys, come on!
Let's go!

17:06.358 --> 17:08.425
Well, put a plaid
skirt on this

17:08.460 --> 17:09.727
and it's my senior
class picture.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.664
Danny, come on.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.732
Why won't you tell me
who your secret crush was?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.501
I think you're kinda
missing the point

17:16.535 --> 17:17.734
of it being a secret.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.738
Um, it's me, Riley.
You tell me everything.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.640
What do you have
to be embarrassed about?

17:22.675 --> 17:26.678
I don't have anything
to be embarrassed about.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.744
It was just
a long time ago

17:27.780 --> 17:29.447
and I don't want
to talk about it.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.684
Are my presents on
the right feet?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.686
Let me see.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.454
Damn it!

17:36.488 --> 17:37.755
I think I just
popped a gumdrop.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.367
Okay. It's official.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.437
I can't possibly be
more humiliated.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.638
Don't forget your hat!

17:57.409 --> 18:00.545
Oh, and I stand
corrected.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.714
Danny's old elf costume.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.317
Aww, he hasn't fit into
that since he was four.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.456
Hear those bells?

18:11.490 --> 18:13.291
Yeah, that's the last
sound you'll hear

18:13.325 --> 18:15.293
before you're clubbed
to death by a candy cane.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.463
Can we please
just let it go?

18:18.497 --> 18:20.398
You know I'll
figure it out.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.467
Okay, Von Trapps.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.636
- Finally all here?
- Uh, yeah yeah. Just, uh--

18:24.670 --> 18:26.437
- Great.
- You know, we never got

18:26.472 --> 18:27.739
to finish what
we started last night.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.340
Oh! Uh, Ben?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.309
- Mom, hands to yourself, okay?
- Okay.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.679
If I could just get
my little elf to sit down.

18:34.713 --> 18:35.680
Oh, okay. Yeah.

18:35.714 --> 18:36.714
Yeah, I'm just saying,
okay?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.716
I have seen 150
Christmas movies,

18:38.751 --> 18:40.685
and I ain't never
seen a black elf!

18:42.488 --> 18:43.721
Okay, I think
we're ready.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.424
Okay. So when I
yell "Vixen"...

18:46.458 --> 18:48.526
Fine. So she was
on the field hockey team,

18:48.560 --> 18:51.696
we obviously had
the same math class, and--

18:51.730 --> 18:55.667
Oh my God.
I know who it is.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.335
Danny...

18:57.369 --> 18:58.569
<i>One, two--</i>

18:58.637 --> 18:59.570
Ben's gay!

18:59.605 --> 19:01.406
- What?!
- Ben?!

19:01.440 --> 19:02.507
Seriously?!

19:02.541 --> 19:03.574
I'm not gay!

19:03.642 --> 19:05.310
Dude, it's okay.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.712
I guess I'm not
that surprised.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.449
It does explain
the whole Tucker thing.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.284
Wait! Hold up!

19:13.319 --> 19:15.620
Wait, you think
I'm gay?!

19:15.654 --> 19:17.655
Yo, how could you
look at me and say that?

19:20.392 --> 19:23.361
Okay, for the last time,
I'm not gay.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.529
Danny, what is the matter
with you?

19:24.563 --> 19:27.365
Come on!
"Your friend"?

19:27.399 --> 19:28.466
Dad told me.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.535
You told your father
before you told me?!

19:30.569 --> 19:31.703
I didn't tell
anyone anything.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.304
Because he's afraid
to come out.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.306
- I'm not coming out!
- See?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.474
- I'm gay!
- Dad.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.642
- Mr. Wheeler?
- Ray, you don't have

19:37.676 --> 19:39.644
- to cover for him.
- I'm not covering for him.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.412
I'm telling the truth.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.481
Are you serious?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.416
Yes!

19:45.451 --> 19:47.618
You're gay?!

19:47.653 --> 19:51.723
Any chance we could put a pin in
this until after we take the photo?

19:51.757 --> 19:53.458
Wow!

19:53.492 --> 19:56.461
You think you could have eased
into that a little more?

19:56.495 --> 19:59.430
Yeah, I have been told I
need to work on my delivery.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.600
Well, hearing you
say that just

20:02.634 --> 20:05.737
confirms...
Everything I've always known.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.638
You knew Dad was gay?

20:07.673 --> 20:09.440
No.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.509
Nothing was my fault!

20:11.543 --> 20:13.411
Ah! Oh, wow.

20:13.445 --> 20:15.680
It feels so good
to be right.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.316
So does this mean
that we're actually okay?

20:18.350 --> 20:20.551
Uh, I guess.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.321
I just wish you would have
blurted it out at Thanksgiving

20:23.355 --> 20:24.622
like a normal person.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.593
Okay, and we're back.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.595
Okay, everybody together.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.430
Okay, sorry about that.

20:32.464 --> 20:33.765
Though I'm guessing this
doesn't happen every day.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.434
You'd be surprised.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.802
Okay, on three.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.704
One, two...

20:39.738 --> 20:41.672
It was that exchange
student, wasn't it?

20:41.707 --> 20:42.707
Three!

20:47.507 --> 20:50.007
Dear Diary.
It's me again.

20:50.277 --> 20:52.244
Today was epic!

20:52.279 --> 20:54.146
First of all,
girl "X" has no idea

20:54.181 --> 20:55.347
that she's girl "X."

20:55.382 --> 20:58.350
But for safety's sake,
we'll call her girl "Y."

20:58.385 --> 21:01.987
Oh! But I didn't tell you the biggest
thing that happened to me today.

21:02.022 --> 21:03.155
I just found out

21:03.190 --> 21:05.324
that my favorite Chinese
restaurant delivers!

21:05.358 --> 21:07.159
I no longer have
to take two subways

21:07.194 --> 21:09.095
to get those
amazing eggrolls.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.198
Oh!

21:12.232 --> 21:14.233
My dad's gay
and Ben isn't.

21:16.403 --> 21:17.403
Danny.

21:17.404 --> 21:20.374
