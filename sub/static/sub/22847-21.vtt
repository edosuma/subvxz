00:01.127 --> 00:03.379
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.839
You need to look inside yourself

00:04.964 --> 00:06.674
and figure out what kind
of man you want to be.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.593
'Cause lately, what you've been,
it needs fixing.

00:09.885 --> 00:10.928
Where did you get that?

00:11.095 --> 00:13.472
What matters is that we might
be able to save Coulson,

00:13.806 --> 00:16.767
by combining that with my mum's DNA.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.437
This is my ship.
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't welcome here.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.398
- We're here to rescue you.
- Rescue me?

00:22.773 --> 00:24.400
I'm the one that's gonna save us.

00:28.446 --> 00:29.822
<i>What should we do with them?</i>

00:30.031 --> 00:33.117
<i>They're prisoners of war.
Treat them accordingly.</i>

00:46.589 --> 00:49.467
<i>Quake.
I rescued humanity.</i>

00:50.801 --> 00:51.969
<i>Did you know that?</i>

00:52.303 --> 00:54.638
<i>I want to believe you, Daisy.
May I call you "Daisy"?</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:56.057
<i>So, this is Quake...</i>

00:56.849 --> 00:59.894
<i>Destroyer of Worlds.
I think you're here to help me.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.325
Give yourself a moment to adjust.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.162
Your mind will clear shortly.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.167
- Where am I?
- A neutral location...

01:23.709 --> 01:26.253
perched near the edge
of the galaxy, safe.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.506
I assure you.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.467
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:31.842 --> 01:36.180
I am the firstborn Taryan,
master of the house Kasius.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.766
Kasius?

01:39.475 --> 01:40.559
Please...

01:41.393 --> 01:42.728
just hear me out.

01:45.856 --> 01:46.899
You are Inhuman.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.986
I always knew the tales
of the experiments were true.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.197
Okay, for the record,
we don't love to be called experiments,

01:53.405 --> 01:54.490
just "moving forward".

01:54.657 --> 01:57.785
No, I imagine your people
treated you unkindly.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.704
- I've worked through it.
- You deserve better.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.707
All Inhumans do, something better...

02:04.208 --> 02:05.334
elsewhere.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.630
Where are my friends? May? Coulson?

02:10.256 --> 02:11.715
You mustn't worry about them.

02:12.675 --> 02:13.968
They are your past.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.012
I am your future.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.766
You are now prisoners of war.

02:21.559 --> 02:24.061
I suggest you use your time to consider

02:24.228 --> 02:27.606
- the disrespect you've shown me.
- Suggest all you want.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.276
You're just the villain of the month,
and you're going down,

02:30.901 --> 02:34.446
- just like all the rest.
- And how do you plan to stop me?

02:36.031 --> 02:37.199
With Earth weapons?

02:41.036 --> 02:42.705
The tools of cowards.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.667
We Remorath earn our kills.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.378
That is how we earn our rank.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.257
With humans, it's not about earned power.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.384
It's about the gun.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.971
It allows the weak
to pretend to be strong.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.185
I don't need a gun to stop you.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.690
I have several ioniser missiles
aimed at your Lighthouse right now.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.861
If you or your people do anything,
I will release them.

03:15.905 --> 03:18.324
Since you like weapons so much.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.790
Will they be held indefinitely
or scrapped?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.877
That depends on whether
or not they push you to it.

03:31.295 --> 03:33.672
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.551
We are both about to get
everything we need.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.054
All I need is gravitonium.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.724
Well, I know someone
who may be able to help us out.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.392
<i>It's all a bit unpleasant, isn't it?</i>

03:48.145 --> 03:50.648
Try not to think about it.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.735
- Do you think it will work?
- Daisy's plan? I don't know.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.821
Frankly, the Centipede Serum
is terrifying to me.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.992
Yeah, let's... let's walk through
the simulation one more time.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.619
Yeah.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.415
The Centipede Serum
forces new cellular pathways,

04:08.666 --> 04:10.334
like biological infrastructure.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.337
In doing so, it can also carry
any element we feed it.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.631
For example, Jiaying's healing DNA...

04:16.382 --> 04:18.550
which we could deliver to, say...

04:19.176 --> 04:21.428
- Coulson's ailing cells.
- Should work.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.181
- It's just...
- What Yo-Yo said...

04:24.723 --> 04:26.016
- the danger.
- Yeah.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.979
Well, I've been thinking
about that, and...

04:30.938 --> 04:34.483
her warning was that trying to save
Coulson ends the world, right?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.530
But, what if... what if...
what if we don't just try?

04:40.990 --> 04:42.783
What happens if we actually succeed?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.288
Jemma, what if there's another way
to frame this?

04:48.914 --> 04:50.457
Coulson wasn't there in the future.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.293
You're saying we break the loop,

04:52.543 --> 04:55.421
not by allowing someone to die
but by making sure they live?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.924
What if all we have to do is not fail?

04:59.300 --> 05:00.884
That's quite an audacious leap...

05:01.885 --> 05:04.763
especially from someone who once believed
time cannot be changed.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.018
Maybe it's time to be audacious.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.193
You got to be kidding me.
That is totally nuts.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.863
No, no joke. It really happened.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.824
Good thing, too, otherwise,
Aida would've killed me.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.701
I've had to hear this story enough.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.203
Yeah, but that's the most
incredible story I've ever heard,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.039
and I'm the same age as my grandparents.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.457
I am done, by the way.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.628
All right, oxygen's been re-routed
from non-essential parts of the plane.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.716
Then, I guess we can breathe easy, right,
wait for the stalwart team to get back?

05:45.179 --> 05:46.889
Did you hear that?

05:58.942 --> 05:59.985
Damn.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.960
I've spent some time on this plane.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.380
Quinjet is this way.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.146
Okay, come on.
How do I get this thing working?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.276
The warnings were right.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.571
Zephyr <i>to Lighthouse.
Mack, anyone? Mack, are you there?</i>

06:45.280 --> 06:47.157
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
Talk to me. What's going on?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.869
<i>- Things have gone a little crazy.</i>
- Yeah, I know. It's all over the news.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.162
No, no. Talbot.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.040
It's... He... He's boarded us.
Him and his new Remorath friends.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.167
<i>- Talbot. Did he see you?</i>
- No.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.461
And that's a good thing.
Agent Kim wasn't so lucky.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.297
- Talbot killed Kim.
<i>- Very, very much.</i>

07:02.589 --> 07:04.633
The general's not on our side
anymore, okay? He...

07:07.094 --> 07:08.137
Oh, no.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.808
Stand down.

07:14.143 --> 07:16.019
I don't need the jet so I can fly.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.189
I need it so I can breathe.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.825
<i>He's leaving.</i>

07:32.077 --> 07:33.620
<i>And I think he's coming down to you.</i>

07:40.335 --> 07:43.172
I don't understand.
If he's flying the Quinjet,

07:43.338 --> 07:45.090
I should be reading
its signature somewhere.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.011
Not if he's figured out a way to go dark.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.138
If he's not relying
on the quinjet's own power,

07:51.221 --> 07:53.056
- then that means...
- Then the signature wouldn't show up.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.894
Okay. What if I force it by remote?

07:59.897 --> 08:02.691
- You can do that?
- I can do many things.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.568
If we can find Talbot...

08:05.235 --> 08:08.197
maybe we can talk him down and end this
before anyone else gets hurt.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.492
Yes. Maybe.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.415
Prison cells are all the same,
no matter what species builds them.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.708
If there's a way in...

08:20.709 --> 08:22.127
there's got to be a way out.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.672
So, we're just not gonna talk about him?

08:26.048 --> 08:28.258
- "Him" who?
- Phil, come on.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.719
- Talbot.
- Oh.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.596
That "him".

08:33.179 --> 08:37.226
Look, I hate it, too,
but I've seen a man go rotten overnight.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.561
He might be lost.
You don't have to feel

08:39.686 --> 08:41.355
- like you're responsible.
- Of course, I do.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.900
After all our ups and downs,
Talbot got shot in the head,

08:45.192 --> 08:46.985
and he waited for us to rescue him
from Hale.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.030
- We were a little busy.
- Yes, but even after we didn't come,

08:50.322 --> 08:52.282
even after Hydra messed with his brain...

08:53.492 --> 08:55.369
he still put himself in that machine.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.164
- He did that for us.
- We didn't ask him to.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.707
We didn't have to.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.756
- What?
- The first time we met him.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.428
When he told us about the peacekeeping
force he was sending to the Hub?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.597
I mean, imagine back then
if someone had told us

09:15.764 --> 09:19.226
that someday we'd be worried
about Glenn Talbot.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.811
I know.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.314
But things evolve.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.400
They change.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.777
People change.

09:29.653 --> 09:30.779
Yeah, they do.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.200
And sometimes, even then,
you can't save them.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.370
But you still have to try.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.046
Back to work.

10:03.812 --> 10:04.980
Mr Creel.

10:05.897 --> 10:06.982
General?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.151
How you feeling?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.531
- What are you wearing?
- Well...

10:15.073 --> 10:16.241
choices were limited.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.411
It's the new me,
but I'm here to talk about the new you.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.123
It's all right, soldier. Relax.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.751
You've been through a lot.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.919
It's good to see you, Carl.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.048
It's good to see you, too, sir.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.383
I know what it's like.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.344
You're trapped in this hospital bed...

10:36.219 --> 10:37.971
noggin's not working right.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.474
I know you do, sir.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.976
But I also got through it...

10:44.770 --> 10:46.146
and I can help you.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.816
The two of us are stronger together.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.239
General, you seem...

10:57.741 --> 10:59.868
- You all right?
- Right as rain.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.745
Never felt better.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.293
I did come in contact with...

11:09.294 --> 11:10.462
gravitonium...

11:12.297 --> 11:13.382
just like you.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.510
- No.
- It's okay. It's all right.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.762
Soldier, I'm fine.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.308
As a matter of fact,
I've learned a few things.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.603
Do you still hear the voices?

11:30.107 --> 11:31.400
What if I told you...

11:32.442 --> 11:33.694
I know how to control them...

11:35.153 --> 11:38.907
silence them.
I can silence them for you, too.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.788
You are formidable,

11:45.080 --> 11:47.457
but your strength
has been going to waste.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.461
Come with me, and I can show you
how to unleash your power.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.339
- As your weapon.
- As my disciple.

11:54.965 --> 11:59.010
Oh, God. What is with your family
and this God complex?

11:59.177 --> 12:01.388
- What do you know of my family?
- Plenty.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.976
Well, then you know that I am
from a long line of inventive thinkers.

12:06.143 --> 12:10.313
I have ideas, methods,
which don't, shall we say,

12:10.731 --> 12:14.401
- mesh with those of my breed.
- That's not completely chilling.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.319
I'm merely saying that...

12:17.696 --> 12:21.533
I understand what it is to be
on the outside,

12:22.117 --> 12:23.702
as I'm sure you are...

12:24.786 --> 12:27.998
different, hunted by lesser humans.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.375
You deserve better than that.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.795
Look, yeah, some people
have given me a hard time.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.381
Humans are... are complicated.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.217
They disagree.
Sometimes it comes to blows.

12:39.634 --> 12:43.972
Only, sometimes, it's a person
who risks everything for their friends...

12:44.556 --> 12:46.183
even though she lost her limbs.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.143
Hypothetically.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.688
We fight...
okay, but not with a lack of respect,

12:51.938 --> 12:53.982
and that's something I don't think
you're quite understanding.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.319
No matter.
You will come with me...

12:57.944 --> 13:02.032
- willingly or not.
- I'm gonna have to choose "not".

13:07.329 --> 13:08.371
Problem?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.375
What is this?

13:12.834 --> 13:16.171
- Why can't I...
- Because you're not conscious yet.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.048
Not conscious?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.674
I'm not a fool.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.302
I know how strong you are...

13:22.844 --> 13:25.972
and I have to make sure
that you are thoroughly...

13:26.765 --> 13:29.643
broken in...
before you're brought to me.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.781
Fitz, it's done.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.826
This could change everything.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.954
Change everything about what?

13:49.621 --> 13:52.082
Uh... Daisy asked us to run some tests.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.709
Looking for a way to revive
Coulson's necrotic tissue.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.002
Jemma thinks it could work.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.631
Okay, that's...

14:00.507 --> 14:02.217
that's good to know. That's really good.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.136
What do you need, Mack?

14:08.181 --> 14:11.017
It's Talbot. The gravitonium
is becoming a problem.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.561
He's racking up a body count.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.146
- No.
- Yeah. There must be something

14:15.313 --> 14:17.232
you can do to reverse the machine.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.485
Something else that needs fixing?

14:22.946 --> 14:25.115
Right now, Talbot's out there.
He's dangerous.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
If there's a solution,
we need it fast, okay?

14:28.243 --> 14:29.494
Or none of this matters.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.580
Okay, we're on it.

14:32.581 --> 14:33.707
Thank you.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.755
He and I will work it out.

14:43.925 --> 14:44.968
There.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.013
Circuit panel. Good.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.932
Remorath tech wasn't exactly my major,

14:51.099 --> 14:53.643
but let's assume the circuitry
still creates an electric field.

14:54.019 --> 14:57.105
I use the charge from my arm,
maybe I can short it out.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.565
And the door opens.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.817
- That's the theory.
- At this point, I'll take theory.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.320
I mean, we still have to face
the guard outside, but...

15:04.279 --> 15:06.156
we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.620
Hey, guys.

15:11.995 --> 15:15.457
You ever notice these schmucks
are really hard to beat up?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.960
- We're glad to see you.
- Yeah, likewise.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.837
We just had a tiny adventure with Talbot,

15:21.463 --> 15:23.256
and ended with a man down.
I figured I'd better start looking

15:23.340 --> 15:25.091
- for you on the prison level.
- Good thinking.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.887
Where's Daisy? She's not here?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.556
No. Qovas handed her off to his warriors.

15:31.848 --> 15:32.974
We got to find her next.

15:33.224 --> 15:36.728
- You see where Talbot went?
- Sort of. You're not gonna like it.

15:41.191 --> 15:45.028
These voices... I...
...thought I was stuck with them.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.739
You don't have to be.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.161
Let me help you.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.334
You have it in you.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.169
- I...
- It's okay, son.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.673
I'm telling you the truth.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.759
This will make everything better.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.932
Join me.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.249
What do you feel?

16:41.876 --> 16:42.919
Peace.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.089
So much quieter.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.927
- Wait...
- This part isn't gonna be great

16:51.094 --> 16:52.178
- for you, Carl...
- Sir! No!

16:52.387 --> 16:54.264
...but it will be over quickly. I promise.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.766
The two of us are stronger than one...

16:58.184 --> 17:00.353
and your suffering, it's over now.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.613
Thank you, Carl.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.170
<i>Thank you, Carl.</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:26.796
So, he can do that.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.674
He must've gotten his location
from the quinjet's flight log.

17:30.633 --> 17:35.388
We knew Talbot was killing people,
but to see him do that to Creel, I just...

17:39.059 --> 17:40.685
I ever tell you about Isabelle Hartley?

17:41.352 --> 17:43.897
Yeah, a little.
I know she was your friend.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.190
Hmm.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.734
- I know Creel killed her.
- Yeah.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.572
I wanted him dead.
I thought I'd never forgive him,

17:52.906 --> 17:57.660
but, once he was deprogrammed,
and once I got to know him...

17:59.037 --> 18:00.205
he was a decent man.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.458
I'm glad I had the chance.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.002
I'm sure he was, too.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.758
You have an amazing capacity
to forgive people, Mack.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.178
Yeah.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.057
But the bodies are still piling up,
aren't they?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.518
He has to be stopped no matter what.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.895
Yes, and maybe for good.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.900
If it comes to that...
I'm the one who does it.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.027
Understood?

18:39.119 --> 18:42.205
Our Astralscope projects
your consciousness here.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.834
Physically, you are being brought to me...

18:47.001 --> 18:50.630
but rest assured, you are already mine.

18:51.339 --> 18:54.259
You know, I have a little experience
getting out of stuff like this, right?

18:54.592 --> 18:56.219
I'm afraid this is different.

18:57.178 --> 19:01.224
You already lost all sense
of how long you've been here, haven't you?

19:02.767 --> 19:07.981
I find that people outside
of physical space, when they lose time,

19:08.148 --> 19:10.692
when they get hungry but they can't eat,

19:10.984 --> 19:14.279
when they get tired
but they can't sleep...

19:15.822 --> 19:16.906
they break.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.576
So...

19:20.160 --> 19:22.370
I already know what your future holds.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.166
Hm. Funny. I see the future, too.

19:28.042 --> 19:32.338
And you have two despicable sons
who wear even dumber makeup than you,

19:32.881 --> 19:35.717
and they die like cowards
stabbed in the back.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.639
When I get out of this,
I'm stronger than you know.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.808
Everyone thinks that.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.353
But in my case, it's true.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.275
I'm the Destroyer of Worlds.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.420
I don't see a way to reverse the effects
of the gravitonium on his system

20:12.837 --> 20:14.339
or even neutralise it.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.883
How are you doing?
Give me some good news.

20:17.091 --> 20:21.846
I finally got the compound right.
Should only take a few days to synthesise.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.765
It's funny, isn't it?

20:24.933 --> 20:27.101
The Centipede Serum
was part of our first mission,

20:27.268 --> 20:28.853
and now it's the key to curing Coulson.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.982
- We've come full circle.
- Just in time for the end of days.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.153
You ever think it would be Talbot?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.322
I don't want to think about it.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.951
He was one of the good guys.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.790
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what he is anymore, but...

20:49.958 --> 20:51.542
he needs to be stopped,
even if that means...

20:51.709 --> 20:53.836
Even if it means finding
a terminal solution.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.305
I mean,
if there are no other options, we...

21:04.806 --> 21:06.391
we could try the odium.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.687
How do we get him to take it?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.856
Drinking it might not even
be strong enough.

21:17.902 --> 21:21.030
We could use the Centipede Serum
to deliver it straight into his cells.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.963
It's a little too quiet in here.
That make anyone nervous?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.673
Maybe it's Remorath nap time.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.510
Then we need to wake
one up and ask for directions.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.679
All these hallways look the same.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.390
That's the same writing
that was in the Lighthouse in the future.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.726
- What's it say, Deke?
- How would I know?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.353
Because you lived there.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.065
Well, they don't teach you the language.
I can count to five.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.735
You lived there for decades,
and you know five numbers?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.696
I also know zero,
so, no, I know six numbers.

22:01.863 --> 22:06.075
- I'm amazed you were able to survive.
- You know, I found you, didn't I?

22:06.492 --> 22:09.037
And I can lead us back to the <i>Zephyr,</i>
so I'm doing my job.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.539
- You're the ones who lost Daisy.
- We didn't lose her.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.082
Just do your best, Deke.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.127
It won't be long before they figure out
we're gone, so just pick a direction.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.716
This way.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.346
Wait. No, not that way.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.349
We can fight or we can run.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.392
Fight.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.652
Daisy.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.364
Are you okay? Did... Are you...
Did they hurt you, or whatever?

22:44.530 --> 22:47.909
I'm fine. Just had a little
head trip with Father Kasius.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.827
Father Kasius?
What, you mean his dad's here?

22:50.161 --> 22:51.245
Here but not "here".

22:51.537 --> 22:53.581
Well, that's just another reason
that we need to get to the <i>Zephyr</i>

22:53.706 --> 22:56.709
- and fly out of here.
- We're not going. Not yet.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.503
What? What... What are you talk...

22:58.669 --> 23:00.755
You can't escape without,
you know, escaping.

23:00.922 --> 23:03.633
Qovas has a couple of
ioniser missiles aimed at the Lighthouse.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.218
If we try to leave, he'll fire them.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.178
- The Lighthouse can handle it.
- Maybe.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.389
But the people of River's End
might not be so lucky.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.185
We can forget about finding the Quinjet.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.271
- Then how do we find him?
- I don't know. We have to think like him.

23:17.605 --> 23:18.981
He's a man we all knew...

23:19.482 --> 23:22.068
a man that had a lot of stars
and stripes on his uniform.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.154
What does he want to do now
that he has all this power?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.031
Death and destruction.
That's what they all want.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.616
Ah, I'm not so sure.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.618
He risked his life to save us
from the Remorath.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.955
And then he went on a killing spree.
He's in full-villain mode.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.957
Yeah, but, everyone's the hero
in their own story.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.208
Then what's his?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.252
<i>- Macbeth</i> ?
- Ah, I mean it.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.255
Did he say anything
before he went into the machine?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.386
He kept saying, "I can fix this."

23:49.887 --> 23:50.930
What's he fixing?

23:51.681 --> 23:52.723
I don't know.

23:53.141 --> 23:56.894
His mistakes, his reputation?
Maybe he's trying to prove...

23:57.603 --> 24:00.815
that he's still a good soldier,
a good man.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.359
A good dad.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.208
Hello?

24:23.629 --> 24:24.922
Hello, George.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.008
Daddy's home.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.354
What's the matter? Cat got your tongues?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.106
I'm just surprised.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.568
With everything going on in the world,
I... I didn't know...

24:47.153 --> 24:49.155
- You look...
- Like a million bucks.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.158
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.368
Fit as a fiddle. Never better.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.829
I'm a new man. Clear-headed and healthy.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.248
Why are you dressed so funny?

25:00.917 --> 25:01.959
Well...

25:03.711 --> 25:05.379
this is my new uniform, son.

25:08.049 --> 25:11.928
Your dad's a superhero now,
just like those Avengers.

25:12.595 --> 25:15.139
And guess what?
I even have my own superpowers.

25:24.774 --> 25:28.069
That's just a taste.
I can move buildings and cars.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.029
And you want to know something else?

25:30.571 --> 25:33.950
I can even fly. And I don't need a hammer
or an iron suit to do it.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.910
- Can I fly with you?
- Absolutely.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.457
Things are gonna be different
from now on.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.335
Your daddy's all better.

25:46.295 --> 25:49.674
And I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen to you or anyone else.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.635
I'm gonna chase those invaders
out of town.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.053
Now...

25:55.179 --> 25:57.348
- you ready to go for that flight?
- George...

25:57.974 --> 26:00.726
honey, why don't you go up to your room
and play so your father and I can talk?

26:00.851 --> 26:02.353
Not now, Carla. We're having fun.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.814
Glenn, please.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.857
We need to talk.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.736
- I heard about the accident.
- What the hell are you talking about?

26:11.153 --> 26:14.156
- S.H.I.E.L.D. called, and...
- S.H.I.E.L.D.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.080
Sorry.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.167
- Look what you made me do.
- I'm really sorry, Glenn.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.461
They're just worried about you.
That's all.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.088
And so am I.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.882
George, please, honey, go upstairs.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.806
I'm sorry, George.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.808
I can fix it, though.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.938
Better yet, I can take you
to a real spaceship.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.482
What do you think about that, partner?

26:50.735 --> 26:53.279
They are fools if they think
they'll get off this ship.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.365
Bring me the powered one.
She belongs to Kasius.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.242
As for the others...

26:58.868 --> 27:00.911
they do not deserve a warrior's death.

27:02.121 --> 27:06.125
Kill them with their own weapons.
Let them die in shame and dishonour.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.347
We're getting close to the bridge.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.806
We have a clear path
to the <i>Zephyr</i> from here.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.266
We might not get that chance again.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.227
- We're not leaving till we finish the job.
- Yes, you are.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.605
- May?
- I'll deal with the missiles

27:27.772 --> 27:31.275
and get back to the base. You and Daisy
get to the <i>Zephyr</i> and go home.

27:32.026 --> 27:34.695
- Loving this plan. Good luck, May.
- You're with me.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.073
I need you to set the coordinates
for the trip back.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.075
Right, because numbers.

27:39.617 --> 27:40.701
Yay.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.412
No, it's too risky. We do it together.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.170
I'll take care of it. Go home, Phil. Now.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.880
Are you giving me an order?
'Cause that sounded like

27:53.047 --> 27:55.007
- you were giving me an or...
- Yes, I'm giving you an order!

27:55.132 --> 27:57.551
You're just gonna slow me down,
so zip it and get to the...

28:24.995 --> 28:27.164
Thought that might shut you up.
Now go.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.129
Uh...

28:33.295 --> 28:35.673
Not a word, Agent Johnson.
That's an order.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.510
Copy that... Hot Lips.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.724
It's a really big ship,
and it's full of these crazy aliens.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.268
But don't worry, they're my friends.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.688
And I have a friend for you, too.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.817
- Put her down, Dad.
- I can't do that, son.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.652
She's not on our side anymore.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.363
That's not true.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.282
I love you.

29:02.158 --> 29:05.077
- I would do anything for you.
- Oh, really, Carla?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.956
Like when you helped Hydra
brainwash me,

29:09.123 --> 29:11.584
or when you worked with S.H.I.E.L.D.
to conspire behind my back?

29:11.751 --> 29:14.712
- That's not true.
- "Your compliance will be rewarded."

29:15.129 --> 29:17.423
Any of that ring a bell?
Do you remember that? Do ya?

29:17.840 --> 29:19.091
They said it would help.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.137
I'm sorry, Carla...

29:24.472 --> 29:27.099
but the only way I'll ever trust you again
is if you join me.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.705
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.583
We don't want to hurt you, Talbot.
We just want to talk to you.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.419
Where's Coulson? What did you do to them?

29:56.420 --> 29:59.507
- They're prisoners of war.
- We're not at war with you.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.468
They declared war
when they tried to stop me.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.512
Stay right there.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.891
Go ahead, cowboy.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.927
Stop! Stop! Hold your fire!

30:49.682 --> 30:50.933
Take cover!

31:02.486 --> 31:05.322
- Qovas has ordered the launch.
- Excuse me, fellas.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.952
Just looking for the men's room.
You know if there's one close by?

31:12.705 --> 31:14.373
You know what? On second thought?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.458
I'm actually just gonna find
a corner somewhere.

31:44.612 --> 31:49.658
- Urgh! What are you doing?
- Weapons. In case more show up.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.662
Don't just stand there.

31:54.038 --> 31:56.707
Start transferring the missile-target
numbers to the teleporter.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.459
Right, because...

31:58.667 --> 32:00.836
because the Lighthouse is the target,
so the coordinates are ticket home.

32:01.045 --> 32:02.671
That's...
that's good thinking, May. But...

32:03.047 --> 32:05.925
- which one's the launch system?
- I don't know! Pick one.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.142
Nope. That's navigation.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.522
I'll take that just in case.

32:24.485 --> 32:26.362
Okay, I got it. Weapons system.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.989
And I... I found the launch codes.
Do I deactivate the missiles?

32:29.573 --> 32:30.741
We're not deactivating them.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.701
Well, then what the hell
are we doing here?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.662
We're giving them a new target.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.081
Now do you see what I am...

32:38.040 --> 32:39.416
what I've become?

32:39.875 --> 32:41.085
I'm a superhero...

32:41.460 --> 32:43.295
and I plan on doing what needs to be done.

32:43.504 --> 32:44.713
You're not a hero.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.467
George. It's okay, George.

32:48.968 --> 32:51.679
They're the bad people.
They're trying to stop me.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.474
I need to get him out of there.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.615
I can't get near.

33:12.366 --> 33:15.327
You're the bad one.
You want to hurt them.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.622
No. No, I don't. No, I'm just giving
them a warning. That's all.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.249
So, that they'll understand...

33:20.916 --> 33:23.502
that I'm the one who's gonna save them.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.966
I just need to get a little more fuel
in my tank first,

33:29.466 --> 33:30.718
and then I can do it.

33:33.929 --> 33:34.972
You'll see.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.979
You keep watching the news, son.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.314
You'll see.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.084
Close it up.
Let's get this bird ready for lift off.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.463
They're here.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.509
Davis, we're back. Is everything oka...

34:13.052 --> 34:16.472
<i>We're under attack...
Two of them... dark.</i>

34:17.431 --> 34:18.514
Can't lose our pilot again.

34:56.637 --> 35:00.724
- Thanks. I owe you a life debt.
- Nice try, but I'm good.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.061
- I hate those things.
- Tell me about it.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.313
Coulson, you're bleeding.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.148
I'll survive.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.526
Agent Davis, fire up the engines.
It's time to go home.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.402
Go home?
What about Agent May and Deke?

35:13.737 --> 35:15.155
They're taking the express train.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.118
Okay... okay, the one that looks
like the house with the broken roof?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.370
- I think that's a three.
- Uh-huh.

35:21.537 --> 35:24.248
And then... and then it's...
like a... like a...

35:24.414 --> 35:27.668
like a chair with...
with, some wavy lines.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.170
Got it.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.675
All right, give me the next one
so we can get off this ship.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.094
You will never get off this ship.

35:40.806 --> 35:41.890
Watch me.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.732
I will watch you bleed.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.823
- Deke.
- Thank you.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.373
Okay!

36:08.333 --> 36:09.918
- Okay, okay.
- Any day now!

36:10.085 --> 36:11.295
Hey, I'm trying, okay?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.756
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.592
Um... Uh...

36:17.092 --> 36:18.802
There's a crooked something...

36:19.928 --> 36:21.638
something...

36:22.014 --> 36:23.098
Damn it!

36:26.101 --> 36:27.519
Few stitches, I'll be fine.

36:29.188 --> 36:30.230
So...

36:32.482 --> 36:33.734
You made out with May.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.236
- Did I?
- Oh, yeah.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.363
People see what they want to see,
I guess.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.991
- And?
- We're ready for lift off.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.368
Strap yourselves in. This could get bumpy.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.249
- How do you think she's doing?
- Having the time of her life.

36:51.793 --> 36:52.961
Almost done!

36:58.050 --> 36:59.092
Okay.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.138
Crooked teapot and, uh...

37:09.853 --> 37:12.856
And now you'll learn respect.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.527
Okay, that's it.

37:36.213 --> 37:39.299
You have just sealed the fate
of everyone in your base.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.557
And now you will die.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.645
Well, one little thing...

37:52.104 --> 37:53.438
...we changed the target.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.075
Told ya I didn't need a gun to stop you.

38:05.409 --> 38:06.493
How?

38:07.494 --> 38:08.620
I know zero.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.598
<i>- Coulson.</i>
- Tell me you have them.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.977
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

38:32.602 --> 38:35.022
<i>Mack and Yo-Yo just got back, as well.
We'll all be together.</i>

38:35.314 --> 38:36.356
Where were they?

38:36.606 --> 38:37.649
<i>Um...</i>

38:38.358 --> 38:39.651
<i>They went after Talbot.</i>

38:39.943 --> 38:42.154
<i>He killed Carl Creel,
turned him to gravitonium and...</i>

38:42.696 --> 38:43.739
<i>consumed him.</i>

38:43.947 --> 38:46.700
<i>He killed others, as well. I'll brief you
as soon as I have all the details.</i>

38:46.950 --> 38:48.952
<i>- Get back safe.</i>
- We'll see you soon.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.792
I don't think we can treat him
with kid gloves anymore.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.670
He's dangerous and delusional.
If he finds more gravitonium,

38:58.837 --> 38:59.963
- he's gonna...
- Coulson...

39:00.630 --> 39:01.757
what the hell?

39:02.466 --> 39:05.344
I... I... don't understand. It was...

39:08.055 --> 39:09.514
All right, Coulson. Hold it.

39:09.931 --> 39:12.809
Davis, call base! We need a med team
to meet us when we land!

39:13.018 --> 39:14.102
On it.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.522
Coulson, stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.942
You fight, okay? You fight.
I'm gonna get you home.

40:01.441 --> 40:02.776
He is not going to die.

40:03.527 --> 40:06.530
Not yet, at least.
But his condition is worsening...

40:07.489 --> 40:09.324
and accelerating.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.201
What about the treatment
we talked about?

40:11.993 --> 40:13.495
We have something we think will work.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.039
It will just take some time to combine it
with the Centipede Serum.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.042
- Time we don't have.
- We're doing everything we can.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.460
What about Talbot?

40:20.836 --> 40:22.629
You find a way to stop him?
He's worse, too.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.172
Yeah, we think so.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.425
Unfortunately, it's not a cure.
It's more...

40:27.884 --> 40:30.053
It's more terminal.

40:30.387 --> 40:34.057
If we can combine the odium
with another dose of the Centipede Serum,

40:34.224 --> 40:36.726
- it should be able to penetrate his cells.
- That's not possible.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.480
Well, yeah, it's entirely possible.
We ran a simulation...

40:40.647 --> 40:43.442
No, it's not possible.
There is no more Centipede Serum.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.819
What I brought back,
that's the last of it.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.494
So, we either save Coulson...

40:56.329 --> 40:57.664
Or we save the world.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.021
Don't worry.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.231
These fellas don't bite.

41:24.774 --> 41:27.277
At least, I don't think they do.
You don't bite, do ya?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.450
- Who's flying this plane?
- Gravity.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.245
It doesn't just make you
crash and burn, darling.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.705
It also makes you ascend...

41:39.873 --> 41:40.957
to the heavens.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.834
What do you want from us?

41:49.633 --> 41:50.759
You drew me.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.095
You see me in your head, don't you?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.685
You ever see me tearing the Earth apart...

42:02.020 --> 42:03.855
bringing something up
from the ground?

42:11.571 --> 42:12.614
Good.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.158
Now tell me...

42:15.951 --> 42:16.993
where.
