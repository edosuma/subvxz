And you will look fo <i>rw</i> ard
to the morning

01:41.600 --> 01:43.900
when you will awaken
from a good night's sleep,

01:44.600 --> 01:47.600
bring your lD
and your Number 2 pencils

01:47.900 --> 01:50.400
and arrive at your SAT testing site

01:50.700 --> 01:55.500
approximately 20 minutes
before the test begins.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.100
Why, so we can worry
for an extra 20 minutes?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.200
No, so you don't have to worry about
being late on top of everything else.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.300
Relax, Eraserhead, you're a junior.
Come on, it's a piece of cake.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.600
Yeah, well, lf it's so easy, why are you
all in here taking your SATs again?

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
l want you to simply bring yourself
back to the sound of my voice saying,

02:14.900 --> 02:17.400
''S.D.S.M.''

02:17.700 --> 02:22.200
Scan, discard, select, move on.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.300
Scan, discard, select, move on.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.100
--on my SAT test.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.300
Boring, huh?

02:31.500 --> 02:33.400
Excuse me, we're from KTMB-TV.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.200
Would any of you be willing
to talk to us

02:35.500 --> 02:36.800
about the pressures you're feeling

02:36.900 --> 02:39.500
getting ready
for the college entrance exams?

02:42.700 --> 02:44.600
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's just the local news.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.100
--pressure to get
the highest possible scores.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.700
These courses make us feel
like at least we have--

02:50.100 --> 02:51.300
The hell it is.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.600
l'm gonna try and see if l can improve
my scores the second time around.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.400
- Hey.
- Steve, what are you doing?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.900
Can l have my mike back, please?

02:59.200 --> 03:00.600
- Why should l?
- Steve.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.200
Don't you know
who these people are, Brenda?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.200
Did you ever hear of a sleazy TV show
called B <i>ack Story?</i>

03:06.900 --> 03:09.000
lt's a junk-a-thon news magazine
that goes out of its way

03:09.300 --> 03:10.700
to ruin people's lives on national TV.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.800
Look, that is not true.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.500
What about the story you ran
on Samantha Sanders?

03:15.800 --> 03:17.000
Hey, l'm new on the show.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.600
Don't try to weasel out of it.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.300
That was a hatchet job
if ever l've seen a hatchet job.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.900
Steve, let's just get out of here.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.600
Come on, man,
don't waste your breath.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.900
- Really.
- My mike, please?

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Thanks.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.000
Next time, l'll break it.
And your camera too.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.300
Samantha Sanders is his mom.
He's very protective of her.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.600
l can see that.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.300
Well, Brenda,
good luck on your test.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.300
Thanks.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.500
Hey, buddy, l heard you whaled
on some unsuspecting newswoman

04:09.800 --> 04:11.000
last night.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.400
Don't get me started.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.300
Brenda said you were just releasing
some pent-up sexual tension.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.500
Give me a break, okay?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.399
Oh, well, speaking of pent-up,

04:19.700 --> 04:22.000
there's some sweet young thing
who has her eye on you.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.300
Nikki Witt?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.300
Oh, try not to show
so much enthusiasm.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.600
She's a sophomore.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.900
So you got some age-bias thing
going here?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.200
No, l got no age-bias thing
going here.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.900
But let's not forget, this is the girl

04:36.100 --> 04:38.200
who was throwing herself
at young David Silver.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.200
- Now, maybe you're hard up.
- Hi, Steve.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.100
- Hey, Suds. How are you doing?
- Great.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.200
- So we're still on for tonight, right?
- Eight o'clock, Peach Pit.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.900
- Great. Bye, Brandon.
- Bye.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.700
Well, l guess Brenda was wrong.
No flies on you.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.200
No Suds on me, either.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.800
She's B.J. Harrison's girlfriend.
He'll be sitting between us.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.600
Aren't there enough college girls
in the world

05:01.900 --> 05:04.000
that these guys don't have to come
back and raid our class?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.600
- Bran, she's a junior.
- A junior?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.400
Don't you know
girls mature faster than guys?

05:09.800 --> 05:12.400
Not in my house, they don't.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.000
- Oh, l really need a cigarette.
- You're really hooked now, aren't you?

05:16.300 --> 05:18.700
l am not. lt's just
that l'm a little stressed out

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
with these SATs
and everything else going on.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.400
So you wanna add radiology treatments
to your busy schedule.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.200
Kelly, l don't smoke that much.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.300
A few measly puffs
is not gonna give me lung cancer.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.700
Did you know that smoking
increases your stress level?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.300
Why don't you just lighten up?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.400
lf your parents knew,
they would flip out.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.800
Yeah, well, so would Dylan.
He hates smoking with a passion.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.500
But fortunately,
he loves the smell of perfume.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.400
Don't say anything, okay?

05:45.100 --> 05:48.500
- Whatever.
- And don't say goodbye either.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.300
Since you're technically
still my senior buddy,

06:01.600 --> 06:03.400
- can l ask you a question?
- Sure.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.100
Why is everyone
so rattled around here?

06:06.400 --> 06:09.500
- lt's not even a full moon.
- The SATs are this Saturday.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.200
Oh, that's what's going on
with Brandon.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.700
No, actually, he and Andrea
are the only ones l know

06:15.000 --> 06:16.400
who aren't taking the SAT again.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.200
Well, then, what's his story?
l mean, he's so serious all the time.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.300
That's just at school. At the Peach Pit,
he is a completely different person.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
Thanks for the tip.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.300
Well, once a buddy, always a buddy.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.900
Brenda, l was hoping l'd find you.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.000
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

06:52.900 --> 06:56.900
l want you to know, l had nothing to do
with that smear on your friend's mom.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.700
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.400
Can we go somewhere and talk?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.300
Believe me, working for B <i>ack Story</i>

07:06.600 --> 07:10.100
was not where l thought l'd end up
after journalism school.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.700
But jobs are hard to come by.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.200
Well, l guess you gotta do
what you gotta do.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.000
Well, l still think l can do the kind
of quality work that bucks convention

07:19.400 --> 07:21.200
and breaks down the stereotypes.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.900
But l need your help.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.200
- Beth, l don't know.
- lt's a natural, come on.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.100
''Stay tuned for the back-story

07:29.300 --> 07:32.400
on the kids that go to high school
in the most glamorous city in America.''

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
How is that gonna break down
any stereotypes?

07:35.700 --> 07:37.900
Because l'm not gonna do
a generic profile

07:38.200 --> 07:41.500
of the blond bimbette on Rodeo Drive
with her daddy's gold card.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.700
What interests me

07:43.900 --> 07:47.200
is that you and your friends
are just a bunch of ordinary kids

07:47.600 --> 07:50.500
living in an extraordinary community.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.900
Yeah, l guess Beverly Hills
can take some getting used to.

07:54.300 --> 07:58.000
Which is a lot easier
if you get past the surface glitz

07:58.300 --> 08:00.700
and look at the difference between
what's real and what's hype.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
Right?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.100
Do you have another cigarette?

08:09.900 --> 08:11.400
So when did you start smoking?

08:11.600 --> 08:14.700
l was in Paris for the summer.
Everybody was doing it.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.300
l started my senior year too.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.500
Actually, your friends remind me

08:20.700 --> 08:23.100
of the crowd
l used to hang out with in high school.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.500
We're still really close.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.700
So, what do you say?

08:30.900 --> 08:32.600
Well...

08:34.299 --> 08:36.700
Do l get to be on camera?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.400
There you go, man.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.600
B.J., Steve called,
he's running late as usual.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.600
- No sweat.
- How's college treating you? Okay?

08:49.800 --> 08:52.300
- l'm learning the ropes.
- Good deal.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.400
Here you go.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.000
Brandon, l need to talk to you.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.200
How much perfume
are you wearing?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.400
Listen, can we go sit down
for a minute?

09:03.700 --> 09:05.400
Brandon, order's up.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.300
l can't right now.
Bren, what's the matter?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.600
- lt's nothing, it's just--
- Brando.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.500
- Look, you go ahead. l'll wait.
- Thanks.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.000
- Hey, Brandon.
- Stevie, your date's right over there.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.800
Nice perfume you're wearing.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.100
Sir, your order will be right up.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.300
Here you go and here you go.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.200
Orders up on 1 1 and 1 4.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Brandon.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.600
Hi. Wow, l didn't know
you worked here.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.700
- What a--
- Brandon.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.900
Excuse me.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.400
--surprise.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.300
Hey, B, do you got any old term papers
lying around collecting dust?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.500
l might.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.700
l thought senior year would be a breeze,
but they're just piling on the work.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.500
lt's funny
you should say that, Steve.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.800
That's kind of why l'm here.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.300
l'm about to make your life.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.700
What is that? The key to your heart?

10:08.700 --> 10:12.200
No, this is the master key
to West Beverly High.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.400
lt unlocks every office,
every filing cabinet,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.500
every grade bank.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.400
Think of the possibilities, Steve-o.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.900
Yeah, right.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.900
Hey, this isn't a trick, Sanders.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.600
This key is a legacy

10:26.900 --> 10:28.400
that's been passed down
year after year

10:28.500 --> 10:31.600
to the one student who's lucky enough
to carry on the tradition.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.600
And now it's your turn.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.700
Where'd you get it?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.400
l'm not gonna tell you that.

10:40.600 --> 10:45.700
And you'll never say
where you got it, right?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
Why me, B.J.?

10:47.700 --> 10:50.400
l just wanna make sure
you wind up in my frat someday.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.400
l don't know.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.800
Hey, look, Steve, you don't want it?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.700
l'll find someone else who does.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.100
l didn't say l don't want it.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
l could get into a lot of trouble
with that key.

11:06.600 --> 11:11.100
Okay, look, you need a little time
to think it over.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.200
You got till the weekend.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.400
And for once in your life, Sanders,

11:21.400 --> 11:22.800
try not to be a jerk.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.700
So l've got three orders up,

11:33.900 --> 11:36.100
and she just keeps saying,
''l can't decide.''

11:36.400 --> 11:39.100
l mean, either you like vanilla
or chocolate, am l right?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
Why don't you just ask Nikki out
and get it over with?

11:43.300 --> 11:44.800
l don't know.
She makes me nervous.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.500
Well, maybe you make her nervous.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.100
l just wish l could make her
a little older, you know?

11:49.300 --> 11:51.800
She seems so innocent.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.600
Appearances can be deceiving.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.600
<i>V</i> ery deep, Bren. <i>V</i> ery deep.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.000
- Can we go now?
- Sure.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.000
Look, l know that B <i>ack Story</i>
has a bad reputation,

12:03.300 --> 12:06.200
but Beth only wants to do the story
if it's from my point of view.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.400
l'm sure that's exactly
what they told Samantha Sanders.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.800
Well, l don't know anything about that,
Brandon.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.200
But Beth is the field producer,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.100
and she controls
what goes into the piece.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.000
- l mean, isn't that how it works?
- Yeah.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.500
Still, l'd check
with Mrs. Teasley first.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.900
Why do l need her permission?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.100
You know how image-conscious
the school district is,

12:23.300 --> 12:25.400
especially when it comes
to the media.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.700
Why do you wanna do this thing?

12:27.900 --> 12:29.500
Well, l wanna help Beth.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.400
What is she, your new best friend?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.800
As opposed to my old non-friends?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.600
What's that supposed to mean?

12:35.900 --> 12:37.900
l don't know.
Ever since l got back from Europe,

12:38.100 --> 12:40.800
l feel like l'm not on the same
wavelength with anybody.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
l mean, Donna's off
doing her thing with David,

12:43.500 --> 12:46.200
and Kelly's been so moody lately,
it's like l can't say anything right.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.400
lf it weren't for Dylan,
l wouldn't have anyone.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.200
- Excuse me.
- Present company excluded.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.600
Thank you.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.500
l don't know,
l mean, at the very least,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.600
l have the opportunity
to make a positive statement

12:57.900 --> 13:00.300
about what it's really like
to grow up in Beverly Hills.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.400
Still, check with Mrs. Teasley
before you get into it.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.800
Hey, Dad, what's up?
Going out someplace, big guy?

13:11.100 --> 13:13.600
Yes, if your mother ever finds
the address. How are you guys?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.400
- Great.
- Beat.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.700
- All set.
- Finally. l'm starved.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
- Don't study too hard.
- She will.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
Well, don't party too hard.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.200
- See you later.
- Good night.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.400
This is the thanks we get
for sending you to Paris?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
Everybody smokes in Paris.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.500
Well, no one smokes in this house.
lt's that simple.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.000
l don't know anyone
who smokes anymore.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.000
lt really is a disgusting habit, Bren.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.800
Look, l've only smoked
a couple of times.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.900
l don't even inhale hardly.
So you can all stop worrying.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.000
Aren't there health hazards
that we can't control,

13:48.300 --> 13:49.700
without you voluntarily
adding another?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.300
Dad, if l can survive
the smog in the air,

13:53.600 --> 13:56.100
the pesticides in my food
and the crime in the streets,

13:56.600 --> 13:59.600
then l am bound to beat the odds
on a couple of lousy cigarettes.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.100
Don't dare make light of this.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.200
Mom, l'm sorry.
l just think you're all overreacting.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.000
Well, then you have
a short memory.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.300
Think back to when
you had to see Dr. Donner

14:07.600 --> 14:08.700
about that lump in your breast.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.100
Do we have to refresh your memory
about this family's history

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
when it comes to cancer?

14:12.600 --> 14:16.000
- No.
- Okay, okay, okay, listen.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.100
So she lost her perspective over there
with the Frenchies this summer.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.700
- That's fine. But now that she's back--
- Brandon.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.700
Please shut up.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.500
Do any of your friends smoke?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.800
No, Dad, and l don't either.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.600
l mean, somebody gave me that pack.
ln fact, l can quit anytime.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.000
Well, in that case, now
is just as good a time as any, right?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.200
No problem.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.300
- ''Assuage.''
- To lessen the intensity of.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.800
''<i>V</i> itiate.''

14:59.700 --> 15:01.500
- Pass. Next word.
- What do you mean, ''Pass''?

15:01.700 --> 15:03.200
What do you think this is,
a game show?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.200
l wish it was.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.200
Oh, yes, Donna Martin,
you get this one right,

15:07.400 --> 15:11.000
you can win the grand-prize trip
to...study hall.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.600
Applause from the audience.
Thank you.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.700
Look, they're at it again.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.400
Can't you be sympathetic
to what l'm going through?

15:19.700 --> 15:21.800
l mean, you sound disappointed
that l wasn't grounded.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.000
All l'm saying
is l'm glad your parents caught you.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.800
Can you please
keep your voice down?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
lt's too late for that. What did they
catch you doing this time?

15:28.800 --> 15:32.300
- Because l know l wasn't involved.
- lt was nothing.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.100
Brenda, if you don't tell me,
Kelly will.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.600
My parents found a pack of cigarettes
that somebody gave me

15:37.900 --> 15:38.900
and they went ballistic.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
They wouldn't believe
that they weren't mine.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.400
Bren, that's because nonsmokers
don't usually carry cigarettes.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.500
You don't believe me either? Great.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.300
Brenda, the only thing worse
than having an addiction

15:49.600 --> 15:51.100
is denying that you have one.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.400
- Kelly, please don't get all AA on me.
- Fine.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.100
l quit, okay?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.500
Whether l was ever
officially a smoker,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.400
l am now a nonsmoker.
End of discussion.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
What l'd like to talk about

16:01.900 --> 16:03.500
is what time
you're picking me up Saturday.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.700
We should get there 20 minutes
before the test starts.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.500
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.300
l'm gonna go to West Lompoc
to see my dad.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
What about the SAT?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.400
- Take them next time.
- Dylan, that's what you said last time.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.900
You're gonna miss
the college application deadlines.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.500
So those are the breaks.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
You are so frustrating.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.600
lt's not written in stone that everybody
has to go right to college

16:22.900 --> 16:25.500
- after they graduate from high school.
- Thank you.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.100
Thanks, Kel.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.000
l saw you guys watching us.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.500
Did you work everything out?

16:38.200 --> 16:40.200
Oh, yeah, everything's just groovy.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.400
David, did you remember to bring
the video scrapbook l asked for?

16:43.700 --> 16:45.300
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.500
l hope your friend
gets a kick out of it.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.100
You know, l hate seeing you and Kelly
fighting all the time.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.800
Yeah, well, tell it to Kelly.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.000
l was hoping it was you.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.900
l brought you the yearbook

17:12.000 --> 17:14.099
and the video scrapbook
that a friend of mine made.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
lt's actually pretty good.
Most of it's in focus.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.700
Fantastic. This is gonna be
a dynamite segment.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.300
One more thing. Before you start,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.200
you need to get permission
from Mrs. Teasley.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.000
- Who?
- Our vice principal.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.300
Oh, okay, whatever's standard.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.500
But l think l'm gonna
put the piece together,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.700
let her see it first
and then make up her mind.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.100
You're the reporter. Bye.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.100
Where are you going?
Wait a second.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.100
l have to get back to class.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.200
Oh, l wanted you
to go over this stuff with us.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.100
At least let me introduce you
to my supervising producer.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.900
Come on.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.500
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.900
Dan will be off in a minute.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.700
Wow, you have, like, a whole
command post set up here, don't you?

17:59.900 --> 18:03.800
Yeah, B <i>ack Story</i> has 1 5 mobile units
around the country.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.600
We can edit right in here.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.700
lt gives us a lot of options.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.900
Well, now, l have the back-story
on B <i>ack Story,</i>

18:12.400 --> 18:14.000
You sure you can't stay
and help me?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.400
Well,

18:16.800 --> 18:19.300
maybe just for a minute.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.500
So Mr. Meyers wants to see
the proofs by tomorrow.

18:22.700 --> 18:23.900
- No problem.
- And another thing.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.000
We were talking about getting a rep
from each grade on the B <i>laze</i> staff.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.400
Yeah, l think it's a good idea.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.200
Well, l think we found
our first volunteer

18:30.400 --> 18:32.100
in the sophomore class.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.900
Hi, guys.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.600
Brandon, you know Nikki, don't you?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.700
Yes, we've met.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.900
Several times.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.200
B <i>renda, l'd even</i>
<i>share my clothes with you</i>

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
<i>if it meant that you'd stay,</i>

18:53.400 --> 18:57.800
- She struck me as kind of an airhead.
- No, she's not.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.300
ln fact, Donna and l were
in a French immersion programme

19:00.600 --> 19:02.000
in Paris this summer.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.300
And by the end of it,
she was speaking...

19:05.700 --> 19:08.400
Well, she had really, really improved.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.400
So she's partial airhead.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.200
No, Donna has a learning disability.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.600
But she's not letting that stop her
from taking her SATs.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.300
And she's the sweetest person
l know.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.500
And well-dressed.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, she is a total clotheshorse.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.200
Although, she's not
quite as bad as Kelly.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
Kelly.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.600
- Now, Kelly is the other blond.
- Right.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.300
And what's she like?

19:36.100 --> 19:37.100
Well, when l first met her,

19:37.400 --> 19:40.000
l thought she was
the typical Beverly Hills snob.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.600
You know, nose job,
Beemer and an attitude.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.100
She's become one of my best friends.
l really admire her.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.200
- And why is that?
- She's totally turned her life around.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.400
Before l moved here, she was,

19:53.400 --> 19:55.100
shall we say, pretty loose?

19:55.800 --> 19:56.800
And now?

19:57.100 --> 19:59.300
She's completely changed.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.400
l feel sorry for her, though.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.000
A lot of people
can't get past her looks

20:03.300 --> 20:06.800
and see what a smart and loving
and caring person she really is.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.500
You know what?
You're really good at this.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.400
Thanks.
Can l have one of those?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.500
Sure, help yourself.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.700
- Mrs. T, how you be?
- l'd be fine

20:25.000 --> 20:27.600
if a certain senior didn't park his car
in the faculty parking lot.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.000
- Well--
- Steve, next time, l tow it.

20:30.300 --> 20:34.900
- Mrs. Teasley, how's it going?
- B.J., to what do we owe this honour?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.900
Please don't treat him like royalty.
lt goes straight to his head.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.500
Well, you don't make dean's list

20:40.800 --> 20:43.200
and boys' honour society
three terms in a row

20:43.400 --> 20:45.200
unless your feet are planted
on the ground.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.300
Or unless you're just lucky.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.800
- How are you doing, Steve?
- Well, not as good as you, l guess.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.900
And so, America, you might think
that the kids that live in Beverly Hills

20:58.300 --> 21:00.800
must be some alien life form.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.800
But if you stop and look
at somebody like me, for example,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.700
l have a head, two arms, two legs.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.200
l have two parents,

21:08.400 --> 21:11.000
who've been married to each other
for almost 20 years.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.500
That isn't typical, is it?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.700
l'm from Minnesota, remember?

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
- Okay, cut.
- Was that okay?

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
That was great.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.600
Better than
l ever could have hoped for.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.500
Oh, my God.
l can't believe how late it is.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.100
l guess l totally blew off school.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.200
l'm sorry, Brenda.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.000
lt's okay, it was for a good cause.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.700
You don't have a spare toothbrush
by any chance, do you?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.400
No, sorry.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.600
- Hey.
- Sorry l'm late.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.400
l didn't think
you were gonna come at all.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.900
- Yeah, and did you miss me?
- Yeah. Come here.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.600
Babe, l can tell
you brushed your teeth,

21:55.900 --> 21:58.000
but you still reek of cigarette smoke.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.700
Well, l was in a confined space
with a lot of smokers.

22:02.800 --> 22:07.100
Bren, l have never had a long-term
relationship with a smoker.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.700
l don't intend to start now.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.500
Fair enough.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.000
Tell you what.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.300
l'll quit smoking forever,
on one condition.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.900
And what might that be?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.700
That you take your SATs
this Saturday.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.700
Dylan, just consider it.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.200
Deal. l'll consider it.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.800
Now you come here.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.100
Not until you get out
of those smoke-ridden clothes.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.600
You just wanna see me slip
into something more comfortable.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.400
Absolutely.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.900
Yeah, that part's no good anyway.
lt's really ove <i>rw</i> ritten.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.500
- That's the part l liked.
- Yeah?

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
Well, it's stylized.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.900
lt's sort of a cafeteria
stream-of-consciousness sort of thing.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.600
Listen, Nikki, l'm not giving this
the full attention it deserves right now.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.100
Maybe we should give this to Andrea
and see what she has to say.

23:06.700 --> 23:10.000
- So you want me to come back later?
- Yeah.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.300
Okay.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.200
Bye.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.300
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.400
You know, it won't work, Brandon.
You can't just pawn her off on me.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.900
Although what you have against her
l don't quite understand.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.900
- l mean, she's smart, adorable--
- All right. Enough already.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.500
Andrea, you like her so much,
why don't you take her out?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.000
Look, if it's that bad,
can l give you a word of advice?

23:35.300 --> 23:36.400
Nip it in the bud.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.600
Yeah.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.400
Yeah, it's no fun pining over someone
who's not interested.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.400
Brenda.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.000
l hope l didn't catch you
at a bad time.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.200
Oh, well, we're still
piecing the segment together.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.900
- l'd invite you in, but--
- lt's okay.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.600
l have to get back to class.
l just need to return the video.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.300
Okay. Hold on, l'll get it for you.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.200
Brenda Walsh is here.
What am l supposed to tell her?

24:10.600 --> 24:12.000
Tell her it's not gonna fly,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.200
unless you can come up
with a better hook.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.400
Where's the heat? Where's the:

24:17.700 --> 24:20.300
- That's not what l pitched.
- Well, that's what l need.

24:20.700 --> 24:24.000
Dan, l promised her
l wasn't gonna exploit these kids.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.100
l hope you didn't put it in writing.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.800
lt's just not right.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.200
Either you're gonna do it, or l am.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Here you go.
Thanks for all your help.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.800
Thank you.
l can't wait to see it. Bye.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.500
Bye.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.600
You mean B <i>ack Story</i> is doing
a piece on West Beverly High?

24:59.900 --> 25:02.600
We had to escort a cameraman
off the premises.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.700
And they have a Winnebago
parked on Alcott Drive.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.700
- So no one asked for permission?
- No, they did not.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.900
Probably because they knew
we wouldn't give it to them.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.600
So please,
put an announcement in the paper

25:14.900 --> 25:17.600
that we don't want any students
cooperating with these people.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.600
No problem.
We can squeeze into this issue.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.500
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.800
l hate tabloid journalists.
They are the sleaziest.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.400
What's wrong?

25:30.300 --> 25:32.600
l gotta go talk to Brenda.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.800
- Steve, Steve, you seen Brenda?
- No.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.100
l hope everything's okay.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.900
Do you think he works too hard?

25:47.600 --> 25:50.000
l love new art supplies.
They're so clean.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.600
- Hey, you guys seen Brenda?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.600
Brenda and Kelly haven't been
getting along so well lately.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.000
Hey, Brandon,
where's your sister, man?

26:07.300 --> 26:09.100
l was just about to ask you
the same thing.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.300
l wanted to say goodbye
before l left for Santa Maria.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.700
Going to see your old man?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.400
Yeah. Oh, by the way, this girl,
she was asking me about you.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.200
Her name is Nikki Witt?

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
That girl.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.200
She wanted to know
if you had any hobbies or anything.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.800
So l told her
how much you like to knit.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.400
Thanks, buddy.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.400
Tell Bren l'll be back Sunday.
l'll see her then.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.300
Aren't the SATs on Saturday?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.800
Yeah, but, you know,
college isn't really where my head's at.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.700
l know, but there is something
to be said for keeping options open.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Same can be said for you.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.500
- Tell Nikki l said hi.
- l'll do that.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.400
- Hello?
- <i>Mom, listen, did</i> B <i>renda</i>--<i>?</i>

26:47.800 --> 26:50.400
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.300
Was Brenda expecting me to give her
a ride home from school today?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.600
<i>Do you know?</i> B <i>ecause</i>
<i>l have some things l have to do,</i>

26:55.900 --> 26:57.600
No, she was gonna study
all day in the library

26:57.800 --> 26:59.000
because the SATs are tomorrow.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.800
Thanks, Mom.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.100
ls everything all right?

27:05.800 --> 27:09.400
Yes. Yes. Everything is all right,
thank you very much.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.000
And everything will remain fine

27:11.300 --> 27:13.200
whether you're hanging out here
asking me about it,

27:13.400 --> 27:15.500
hanging around the newsroom,
dropping by the Peach Pit,

27:15.700 --> 27:18.900
or whatever else you happen
to be doing, everything will be just fine.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.400
Look. Look, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.900
l have nothing against you personally,
l don't. lt's just--

27:27.500 --> 27:29.000
l've had a lot on my mind lately.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.900
No, wait, that's not even it. Look.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.300
lt just wouldn't work out, that's all.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.900
We're completely different people.

27:37.100 --> 27:40.200
The odds are stacked against us,
if you know what l'm saying.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.300
lt's just the way l feel, l'm sorry.

27:44.500 --> 27:49.100
Wait, l think l've missed
a vital part of this conversation.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.600
Can we go back?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.900
All l said was, ''ls everything okay?''

27:53.200 --> 27:57.900
And you told me that it was,
and l'm happy to hear it.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
l've just been a little distracted.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.000
Bye, Brandon.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.400
- What are you doing here?
- l don't give you advice that often,

28:24.700 --> 28:26.700
so when l do, do me a favour
and take it, okay?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.200
Fine, thanks. How are you?

28:30.900 --> 28:32.300
l was better
before Mrs. Teasley came in

28:32.600 --> 28:35.200
with an edict from the school board
about B <i>ack Story,</i>

28:35.500 --> 28:36.900
Didn't l tell you to get permission?

28:37.200 --> 28:38.900
The show's going
to take care of all that.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.000
They're going through channels.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.800
What did you tell these people?

28:43.400 --> 28:45.700
Brandon, l think
that you should just relax.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.100
Let me get back to the one thing
l do have to worry about,

28:48.400 --> 28:49.600
which is the SATs.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.000
Man, what a miserable day.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.900
l spend all afternoon
looking for Brenda

29:00.200 --> 29:01.300
to keep her out of hot water,

29:01.500 --> 29:03.400
and when l finally track her down,
her response is,

29:03.700 --> 29:06.000
''Go away, Brandon, l'm busy.''

29:06.300 --> 29:08.500
Brenda can take care of herself.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.200
The counter's filling up, Brandon.
Come on.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.400
l'll be there.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.300
l wish this job
could take care of itself.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.800
Or that paper that's due on Monday
l haven't started yet.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.900
What would you do if someone offered
to make your life a little easier,

29:23.300 --> 29:25.400
at least
in the academic department?

29:25.700 --> 29:27.700
l'd say,
''How much and where do l sign?''

29:30.800 --> 29:33.700
Well, you've gotta swear
on your parents' grave

29:34.000 --> 29:37.400
that what l'm about to tell you,
no one will ever know.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.000
How about just a simple promise?

29:41.500 --> 29:44.000
Someone offered to give me
the master key to the school.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.100
What do you mean the master key?

29:46.800 --> 29:49.900
lt's been handed down
from student to student for years.

29:50.100 --> 29:53.600
lt opens up every office,
every filing cabinet,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.300
every grade bank.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.400
And you have this key?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.000
Let's just say
there's a window of opportunity

30:01.300 --> 30:05.800
that's available to me,
or us, if you're into it.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.500
Well, l guess
things have come full circle.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.100
We became friends
in Mr. Danzel's history class,

30:13.400 --> 30:16.100
when you were only interested in tests
you already knew the questions to.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.600
- Well, that sure backfired.
- What makes you think this won't?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.100
Steve, the way l look at it,

30:22.200 --> 30:24.600
anything you can't do out in the open
ain't worth doing.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.700
You'll get into SC, man.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.300
lf l don't blow it.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.900
Yeah, but you don't need a scam.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.200
What do you wanna be?
You wanna be big man on campus

30:33.500 --> 30:36.100
with a huge GPA, who's always
worried about getting busted?

30:36.400 --> 30:38.300
Or would you rather be a guy
who can sleep at night,

30:38.600 --> 30:40.600
knowing he's doing the best he can?

30:45.300 --> 30:47.900
You always bring out
the Boy Scout in me, Walsh.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.900
That's why l'm here.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.100
Come on.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.600
- Well, speak of the devil.
- We were just watching the news,

30:57.800 --> 31:00.100
when they started promoting
a segment on B <i>ack Story</i>

31:00.400 --> 31:02.500
on growing up in Beverly Hills.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.500
They're running it tonight?
What did they say?

31:05.800 --> 31:09.000
''Rich and spoiled in Beverly Hills.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.800
The back-story
on the teenage inhabitants

31:12.100 --> 31:14.300
- of the glamorous city on earth.''
- ''Rich and spoiled''?

31:14.600 --> 31:16.400
<i>When you hear the name</i>
<i>''</i> B <i>everly Hills, ''</i>

31:16.700 --> 31:19.700
<i>you think of swimming pools,</i>
<i>movie stars,</i>

31:19.900 --> 31:23.200
<i>the lifestyles of the rich and richer,</i>

31:25.000 --> 31:27.200
<i>A golden fantasyland</i>
<i>of palatial estates</i>

31:27.400 --> 31:30.100
<i>and world-class everything,</i>

31:30.300 --> 31:34.200
<i>And the pride of this community</i>
<i>is West</i> B <i>everly Hills High School,</i>

31:34.600 --> 31:37.100
<i>where the princes and princesses</i>
<i>go to school</i>

31:37.400 --> 31:39.200
<i>in their Porsches and convertibles,</i>

31:39.500 --> 31:42.400
<i>their designer clothes</i>
<i>and their all-American smiles,</i>

31:42.600 --> 31:44.300
Look, there's Kelly.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And Donna.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.900
And Steve.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.500
B <i>ut at</i> Back Story, <i>we found</i>
<i>that these children of privilege</i>

31:52.900 --> 31:54.700
<i>have nothing to be smiling about,</i>

31:54.900 --> 31:57.900
<i>For it's a sad fact</i>
<i>that all the money in the world</i>

31:58.200 --> 32:01.300
<i>can't compensate</i>
<i>for the breakdown of family values</i>

32:01.600 --> 32:05.200
<i>that we found in our visit</i>
<i>to this mecca,</i>

32:05.600 --> 32:07.100
Brenda, that's you.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.500
<i>l have two parents,</i>

32:08.600 --> 32:11.200
<i>who've been married to each other</i>
<i>for almost 20 years,</i>

32:11.800 --> 32:13.200
<i>That's not typical here,</i>
<i>though, is it?</i>

32:13.900 --> 32:15.800
<i>l'm from Minnesota, remember?</i>

32:16.400 --> 32:17.900
Brenda, when did you do this?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.600
l didn't say it that way.
l never even talked to that guy.

32:20.900 --> 32:21.900
<i>ln</i> B <i>everly Hills,</i>

32:22.100 --> 32:25.600
<i>you find the tragedy of dysfunctional</i>
<i>families in the extreme,</i>

32:25.900 --> 32:27.600
<i>There are the show-biz kids,</i>

32:27.800 --> 32:30.700
<i>whose parents are consumed</i>
<i>by their own failing careers</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:34.400
<i>at the expense</i>
<i>of their children's emotional stability,</i>

32:34.700 --> 32:37.600
<i>This girl</i>
<i>has a severe learning disability,</i>

32:38.000 --> 32:39.400
<i>Her parents' solution?</i>

32:39.600 --> 32:42.300
<i>Send her to Paris</i>
<i>on a whirlwind shopping spree,</i>

32:42.600 --> 32:45.200
That is so twisted.
l can't even watch this.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.200
<i>And then there's the girl</i>
<i>with the reputation,</i>

32:48.400 --> 32:51.400
<i>This girl found, at an early age,</i>

<i>With an absentee father</i>
<i>and a no-limit credit card,</i>

33:02.200 --> 33:05.400

<i>most of her adult life,</i>

33:07.300 --> 33:12.000
<i>it's no wonder that this blond vixen</i>

33:17.600 --> 33:20.000
Kelly's line is still busy.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.700
Dad, can't we sue them?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.500
l don't know.
Maybe we should look into it.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.700
Honey, l'm sure your friends
will understand

33:27.000 --> 33:30.800
when you tell them that those people
just distorted everything you said.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
No, l never should have said anything
in the first place.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.100
l have to take a walk.

34:00.400 --> 34:04.100
- You saw B <i>ack Story,</i> huh?
- Yeah, it was horrible.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.900
Come on, l'll give you a ride home.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.199
No, l just wanna walk for a while.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.199
Want some company?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.000
That's okay.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.000
What's up, Bren?

34:16.699 --> 34:18.199
Wanna be alone
so you can have a smoke?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.300
Brandon, they made it seem
like l said all those terrible things.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.600
Nobody's ever
gonna talk to me again.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.600
l really need a cigarette.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.199
Bren.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.699
Seems to me if you can
get through this without a cigarette,

34:32.900 --> 34:34.300
you can probably
get through anything.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.800
So you want chocolate sauce
on this?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.300
No. Three scoops, straight up.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.800
Kelly's line is still busy.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
Well, what about Donna?

34:56.500 --> 34:58.100
No answer.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.900
You know, l wish
l could get ahold of Beth Nielsen,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.500
break down
some of her stereotypes.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.400
Of course, she's not even listed.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.800
Kelly, get off the phone.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.300
Yeah, David, hi. ls Kelly there?

35:17.600 --> 35:19.300
Yeah, but she doesn't
wanna talk to you.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.200
And frankly, neither do l.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.800
Hey, Dad.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.100
Hey, l didn't expect to see you
till next weekend.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.700
Yeah, l know. You know, you told me
how slow time passes here,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.500
so l picked up these books you wanted
and l brought them up.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.500
Well, yeah,
time does go slowly here,

35:52.700 --> 35:55.100
but that's why l'm getting good
at keeping dates in my head.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.700
You got the SATs tomorrow.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.200
So?

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
Why did you wanna drive
all the way up here and back?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.500
You ought to be getting
a good night's sleep.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.900
l just thought l'd check out the waves
at Avila State Beach instead.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.600
What?

36:11.200 --> 36:13.000
Don't tell me you're disappointed.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.600
Well, what good
is that gonna do, huh?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.700
l mean, if you wanna learn everything
the hard way

36:18.900 --> 36:20.300
just like l did, you're entitled.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.100
That's right, l am.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.100
You just wanna wait around, hang out,
until your trust fund matures?

36:25.700 --> 36:28.000
- Sounds good, huh?
- Doesn't sound bad.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.800
Then you got a wad of money
in your pocket,

36:30.100 --> 36:31.600
and you think people
will respect you.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.300
Until the money runs out
and you realise they don't.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.800
That's right, l must have forgot
who l was talking to.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.700
You know everything about trying
to buy respect, don't you, Dad?

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
l mean, that's the reason
for the big endowment

36:43.500 --> 36:45.300
to California University, wasn't it?

36:45.600 --> 36:49.100
That's right, Dylan. That's exactly right.
And it didn't work.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.400
Because deep inside,
l knew l was a fraud.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.900
Look, whether you go to college
or not is your decision.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.000
But if you bust your butt
for four years and you get a degree,

36:58.300 --> 37:00.200
nobody can take that
away from you.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.600
You and Jim Walsh
have the same speechwriter.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.900
Look, l don't expect you to do anything
just because l tell you to,

37:07.200 --> 37:09.800
but if you really want the respect
of the Jim Walshes in this world,

37:10.100 --> 37:11.600
you better earn it.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.900
l'll keep that in mind.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.600
Look, Donna, you gotta stop thinking
about that stupid show.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.900
Now, if your mind starts drifting
during the test,

37:29.100 --> 37:31.500
just remember what we learned:
S.D.S.M.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.000
Scan, discard, select and move on.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.700
Scan, discard, select and move on.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.800
Hey. Saw you guys on TV last night.

37:43.100 --> 37:44.900
Miller, why don't you
leave Kelly alone?

37:45.100 --> 37:47.000
She's had a hard enough time
without your lip, okay?

37:47.300 --> 37:49.100
Hey, l'm not gonna dis her, man.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.500
l'm just a little concerned
about your emotional instability.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.600
Get out of my space, butthead.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.900
Donna, l tried to call you last night.

38:11.100 --> 38:15.200
Scan, discard, select, move on.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.100
Kelly, l know how mad you must be.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.300
Please let me say something
before we go in there.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.300
Even though
we've been fighting a lot lately,

38:33.300 --> 38:34.500
you have to know that l love you,

38:35.300 --> 38:37.200
and l would never have said
those things about you

38:37.400 --> 38:39.100
on or off camera.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.200
l mean, you have to believe me.
l feel terrible.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.600
lt's okay, Brenda.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.800
l'm sure you needed
to get that off your chest.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.300
And now that you've done
what you needed to do to feel better,

38:47.500 --> 38:49.400
l have a test to take.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.400
ls it too late to sign up for the test?

39:24.200 --> 39:26.400
- Can l help you?
- ls Brenda home?

39:26.700 --> 39:28.400
No, she's out all morning,
taking her SATs.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.100
Right, she told me. l totally forgot.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
And you are?

39:32.600 --> 39:34.300
Beth Nielsen.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.100
The backstabber from B <i>ack Story,</i>

39:37.400 --> 39:38.600
What do you want with my sister?

39:38.900 --> 39:40.700
More gossip?
Or have you come to finish her off?

39:40.800 --> 39:42.400
Listen, should l come back
another time

39:42.700 --> 39:44.000
or will you take a message?

39:44.200 --> 39:46.300
No, l think you owe it to her
to talk face to face.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.200
Fair enough.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.500
Just out of curiosity,

39:50.800 --> 39:54.000
what could you possibly have to say
to my sister after that smear job?

39:54.400 --> 39:55.700
That l quit.

39:57.300 --> 39:59.100
That my stomach
can't handle it anymore,

39:59.400 --> 40:02.300
and neither can my conscience.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.000
Do you know how l can get in touch
with Kelly Taylor?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.200
Yeah, as a matter of fact, l do.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.800
You know, somehow that seemed
easier for me this time.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.500
Well, you always focus
when you're angry.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.700
- How'd you do, bro?
- l think my brain cells are fried.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.600
Well, it was a walk in the park for me.
l nailed that sucker.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.500
Speaking of walking,
let's get out of here

40:28.700 --> 40:30.100
before Miss Teenage America
comes out.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.300
Really, l'm starving.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.300
Guys, what about Donna?
l mean, they've given her extra time,

40:34.700 --> 40:36.300
but it may take, like,
an hour and a half.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
So we'll go get something to eat
and come back for her.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.900
And what if she finishes early?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.100
Oh, great. Look who's coming out.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.600
Well, l've got nothing to say to her.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.800
So how'd it go?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.400
As badly as you would expect,

41:00.700 --> 41:02.300
considering the amount
of sleep that l got.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.200
Well, if it's any consolation,
l didn't sleep much either, Brenda.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
- l'm glad.
- You have every right to hate me.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.400
- l totally betrayed your trust.
- Yeah, you did. And l don't get it.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.000
You were in cahoots with them too?

41:13.300 --> 41:15.200
No, he wasn't
and neither was Brenda.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.000
She's as much an innocent victim
in all of this as you were.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.700
That's what l'm here to try to explain.

41:19.900 --> 41:22.800
- Yeah, save it for the judge.
- Steve, come on, give her a chance.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.000
Why should we believe
anything she has to say?

41:25.200 --> 41:27.800
Because why else would l be here
if l didn't wanna tell the truth?

41:28.100 --> 41:30.000
She's just trying to assuage
her feelings of guilt.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.600
- Well, it's not gonna work.
- Yeah, you're right, it won't work.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.700
Because l caved at the end,
and l have to live with that.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.700
But it didn't start out that way.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.500
We wanted it differently,
Brenda and l.

41:40.800 --> 41:44.500
We wanted to say, ''Here, you see this
blond bombshell from Beverly Hills?

41:44.800 --> 41:46.300
Well, she's a really terrific girl.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.900
She's sweet and intelligent
and one of a kind.''

41:49.200 --> 41:51.400
That's what you were gonna say.
What was wrong with that?

41:51.700 --> 41:54.300
Because in the real world,
you have a boss,

41:54.500 --> 41:56.600
and your boss has a boss,

41:57.400 --> 41:58.500
and you get sucked in.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.000
That's not a good enough reason.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
l agree.

42:01.500 --> 42:05.300
That's why l quit
immediately after the broadcast.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.700
Look, my apology
doesn't make it right,

42:07.900 --> 42:11.700
but believe me, Brenda had nothing
but the best intentions in this.

42:12.100 --> 42:15.900
And l have her on tape to prove it,
if you'll take the time to look.

42:19.300 --> 42:24.700
Did you really say that l'm intelligent
and one of a kind?

42:25.500 --> 42:27.200
l sure did.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.500
l'm sorry.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.900
Beth, you shouldn't smoke.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.300
lt's bad for your health.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.900
Yeah.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.700
''Assuage,'' young David?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
lt's to lessen the intensity of.

42:54.300 --> 42:57.600
- l know what it means.
- ls that really what it means?

43:00.200 --> 43:01.900
So, what kind of special treatment
did you get?

43:02.200 --> 43:03.500
ls it open-book testing or what?

43:03.700 --> 43:05.600
No, it just means l got more time.

43:05.900 --> 43:06.800
l wish l had more time.

43:07.100 --> 43:09.500
Remember all those questions
they asked about space exploration?

43:09.800 --> 43:11.100
ln the reading-comprehension part.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.600
Well, was the narrator
supposed to be a Martian?

43:15.100 --> 43:17.000
You are so lame.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.400
Steve, he was a Martian,

43:18.600 --> 43:20.600
othe <i>rw</i> ise the whole story
wouldn't have made any sense.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.700
He was a Martian?

43:26.100 --> 43:28.900
Nikki, come here, sit next to me.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.500
No, thanks, really, it's okay.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.400
l don't wanna intrude.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.100
Excuse me.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.800
Nikki. Nikki.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.200
Can l talk to you for a second?

43:47.300 --> 43:48.400
l know what you're gonna say,

43:48.600 --> 43:50.200
but they told me
you weren't working today.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.900
l didn't know
you were gonna be here.

43:52.100 --> 43:53.800
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to be bugging you--

43:54.000 --> 43:55.600
Nikki, Nikki, it's okay.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.000
l just wanted to apologise
for blowing up at you yesterday.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.900
l was preoccupied
with a lot of things.

44:00.100 --> 44:01.900
ln fact, l don't know
really what was going on.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.400
lt was so unlike me, actually.

44:03.700 --> 44:06.200
Obviously,
you're a very nice person.

44:06.900 --> 44:08.600
ln fact, l like you.

44:11.300 --> 44:15.500
There was this boy in third grade,
his name was Marty Halfon.

44:15.900 --> 44:18.500
He used to kick my chair
and make me cry.

44:18.700 --> 44:21.300
And my mother said
it was because he liked me,

44:21.500 --> 44:24.000
which l found so strange.

44:28.100 --> 44:31.000
Sorry, l didn't mean to interrupt.
l just had to do that.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.900
lt's okay. l understand.

44:40.100 --> 44:43.600
So you want a milkshake
or something?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Yeah.

44:45.200 --> 44:47.200
Chocolate or vanilla?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.100
- How about a little of both?
- Little of both.
