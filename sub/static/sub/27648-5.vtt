WEBVTT

00:01.675 --> 00:03.169
That's him, that's my father.

00:03.206 --> 00:05.698
They found skin underneath
his fingernails.

00:05.735 --> 00:06.873
They're running the DNA.

00:06.937 --> 00:09.320
We have an eyewitness account
of an Indigenous woman

00:09.357 --> 00:12.047
fleeing the scene. That
plus broken glass at the motel.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.301
He told me to go home,

00:13.338 --> 00:14.627
and I followed him into the room.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.444
We started fighting,
and that's how I got these.

00:16.481 --> 00:18.899
- But then you left?
- Yes.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.016
I'm ready to go to the station
and tell them what happened.

00:21.053 --> 00:22.255
- Luna Spence?
- We were just

00:22.292 --> 00:23.818
- going to come down to the station.
- You're under arrest

00:23.855 --> 00:25.180
for the murder of David Hanley.

00:25.287 --> 00:27.671
<i>They think I killed him, but I didn't.</i>

00:27.708 --> 00:30.306
I swear. I swear I didn't do it.

00:31.111 --> 00:33.739
<i>I don't know how, but he's gonna
pay for what he did.</i>

00:33.776 --> 00:35.685
He's gonna <i>get what's coming to him.</i>

00:36.281 --> 00:40.000
<i>Message deleted.</i>

00:58.039 --> 01:01.570
Step to your right.

01:07.437 --> 01:09.071
Turn your head.

01:20.762 --> 01:22.696
Face the camera.

01:29.253 --> 01:31.071
Show me your arms.

02:02.477 --> 02:04.043
She's still being processed.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.039
- You should sit down.
- No. We need to get in there.

02:06.140 --> 02:07.607
They'll let us know
when we can talk to her.

02:07.708 --> 02:11.270
Luna is alone. She's vulnerable.

02:11.718 --> 02:14.142
Mercer's gonna try to exploit
that to get a confession.

02:14.211 --> 02:16.950
He can't talk to her without us.

02:17.187 --> 02:19.886
Look, things aren't gonna get
worse if you take a seat.

02:20.406 --> 02:23.949
Don't. Don't make this about me.

02:24.084 --> 02:27.291
- How is this not about you?
- Luna's the one in there.

02:29.624 --> 02:31.598
Joanna, he was your father.

02:32.312 --> 02:35.637
- I know you had your differences...
- Not now.

02:42.828 --> 02:45.363
Some fresh-brewed
police-station coffee.

02:51.328 --> 02:52.758
Here.

02:55.338 --> 02:57.070
Oh.

03:08.402 --> 03:11.204
Might as well get comfy.

03:13.028 --> 03:16.767
Oh! Yeah, we'll get you
something for that.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.589
I'm not the bad guy.

03:29.975 --> 03:31.943
I want the same thing as you.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.470
Find out what happened.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.650
Walk me through it. You help me, and...

03:39.220 --> 03:40.723
I will help you.

03:52.414 --> 03:54.814
I didn't kill him.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.200
But you were there, right?

03:59.302 --> 04:00.699
You argued,

04:00.736 --> 04:03.838
things got heated, and
that's when he scratched you?

04:05.817 --> 04:07.359
Yeah.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.697
Alright.

04:11.059 --> 04:13.327
No, thank you. Thanks,
thanks for the information.

04:15.218 --> 04:17.019
Luna's show cause hearing got moved up.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.637
Scheduled for this afternoon.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.107
- If she doesn't make bail...
- She will.

04:21.208 --> 04:26.023
If she doesn't,
where are they gonna send her?

04:26.914 --> 04:28.982
Brockstone probably.

04:29.232 --> 04:32.151
Brockstone is still in operation?

04:32.553 --> 04:34.566
That place is brutal,
she can't go there.

04:34.603 --> 04:36.509
We have to get her out on bail.

04:40.328 --> 04:43.262
<i>You went there to confront
him; what did he say to you?</i>

04:43.539 --> 04:46.122
I bet he said some horrible things.

04:47.232 --> 04:49.314
How did that make you feel?

04:50.671 --> 04:52.305
How do you think?

04:52.345 --> 04:54.908
Look, I get it. I do.
Sometimes, you just gotta

04:55.009 --> 04:56.876
speak up, push back.

05:00.281 --> 05:02.846
He always had to win,

05:03.021 --> 05:06.119
and now he's finally lost.

05:08.118 --> 05:10.252
<i>Did he have anything with him?</i>

05:10.390 --> 05:12.207
- How do you mean?
- I don't know.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.728
Groceries? Bottle of booze?

05:15.932 --> 05:17.573
I can't remember.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.605
- Luna, stop talking! Now!
- What is she doing in here?!

05:19.644 --> 05:22.369
- Sorry. She barged through.
- I'm here to speak to my client.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.226
- Not finished my interrogation!
- It is her Charter right

05:25.263 --> 05:28.281
to speak to me
before your interrogation.

05:29.944 --> 05:31.945
It's OK, Officer, let her in.

05:34.639 --> 05:37.941
We'll finish our conversation
after you talk to your lawyer.

05:38.352 --> 05:40.654
No rush, you're not going anywhere.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.729
I need to know exactly what you said.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.018
I can't remember.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.601
It's like everything's a blur,
like I have been here for days.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.137
OK, from here on out, you say nothing.

05:57.861 --> 05:59.773
They need to know my side of the story.

06:00.147 --> 06:02.084
Shouldn't they know the truth?
No. Not yet.

06:02.121 --> 06:03.565
I know it's hard to
wrap your head around,

06:03.602 --> 06:05.184
but the more you say right now,

06:05.221 --> 06:07.065
the worse it's gonna be later on.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.612
The next time we'll see each other
will be at your bail hearing.

06:10.773 --> 06:13.353
We think that they're gonna
charge you with manslaughter.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.542
- Manslaughter?
- It's the only thing they can prove.

06:16.579 --> 06:18.961
You're a good student,
you have no criminal record.

06:18.998 --> 06:20.723
This charge is an anomaly,

06:20.760 --> 06:22.399
so we're gonna get you out on bail.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.298
Whatever the cost,

06:24.525 --> 06:26.893
you're coming home with me.

06:29.203 --> 06:31.237
I'm sorry. She barged
right past the desk.

06:31.338 --> 06:34.718
- I tried to stop her, but she...
- It's not your fault.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.862
- I appreciate the effort.
- I'm just trying to do my job.

06:40.081 --> 06:43.810
Look, you're obviously in a
compromising position on this file.

06:44.089 --> 06:45.951
It's nothing I can't handle.

06:46.186 --> 06:47.758
You're one of my best guys, Owen.

06:47.795 --> 06:49.856
This past year, you've really
stepped up your commitment.

06:49.957 --> 06:51.958
Hmm. Thank you.

06:52.059 --> 06:54.594
But I need to remove you
from this case.

06:55.963 --> 06:57.731
Sir, with all due respect,

06:57.768 --> 07:00.436
but my closeness to this case
won't affect my judgement.

07:00.537 --> 07:02.196
Yeah, yeah. I just
don't want to put you

07:02.233 --> 07:03.569
in a compromising position.

07:03.630 --> 07:06.172
- I'm not worried about that.
- I am.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.629
It's for your own good, Owen.

07:11.178 --> 07:13.113
Whatever you think is best.

07:18.164 --> 07:20.133
I wrote everything down that night.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.747
It's all here.

07:21.807 --> 07:24.557
David Hanley was alive
after the argument I heard.

07:25.294 --> 07:26.740
And what do you want to do with it?

07:26.778 --> 07:28.962
Well, I want to take it to the police.

07:29.063 --> 07:32.223
I mean, they need to hear the
full story. This is evidence.

07:32.323 --> 07:34.725
Let me see.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.059
Oh....

07:39.940 --> 07:43.051
I suppose a lot of that is about me.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.182
I started journaling
during my cancer treatments.

07:49.378 --> 07:52.580
The doctor said it would help me
with my darkest fears.

07:54.616 --> 07:56.366
I was mad at you.

07:56.436 --> 07:59.292
Most of what I wrote were things
I wanted to say to you.

08:01.426 --> 08:04.063
Well, I guess I can't
blame you for that.

08:07.397 --> 08:08.768
I never thought journaling would help

08:08.805 --> 08:10.859
someone get out of jail.

08:12.286 --> 08:15.232
You don't want to get
mixed up in this, Taylor.

08:16.143 --> 08:18.044
Dad, she's my friend.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.621
I believe her.

08:20.809 --> 08:23.244
I have to do the right thing.

08:23.376 --> 08:25.878
I know she didn't kill David Hanley.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.151
I still can't believe he's dead.

08:29.911 --> 08:32.597
Did you know that he was there
the day you were born?

08:33.490 --> 08:36.095
He was helping us with
the refinancing of the mill.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.331
And he looked at you, and he said,

08:39.075 --> 08:41.070
"Things may be scary,

08:41.753 --> 08:43.570
"and things are gonna change,

08:43.607 --> 08:47.384
but you have to be brave
from here on out, for her."

08:50.856 --> 08:52.549
I thought I was.

08:53.396 --> 08:56.365
I thought I knew how to be a good dad.

09:00.261 --> 09:03.060
But all I know now
is not to get in your way.

09:05.404 --> 09:07.038
Then don't.

10:03.538 --> 10:05.539
All rise.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.163
Please be seated.

10:14.933 --> 10:17.030
All right. We have before the court

10:17.067 --> 10:20.369
a show cause hearing for Luna Spence.

10:20.876 --> 10:22.777
Is the Crown ready
to present their summary?

10:22.814 --> 10:25.171
We are, Your Honour. Thank you.

10:25.488 --> 10:28.893
Um, on the night of June 5th,
some time after 8 p.m.,

10:28.964 --> 10:31.393
witnesses overheard an
argument between the victim

10:31.430 --> 10:33.808
and the accused, Luna Rose Spence.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.530
As the argument escalated,

10:35.567 --> 10:37.951
the victim defended himself
scratching the accused.

10:38.052 --> 10:39.844
This is corroborated by DNA evidence,

10:39.927 --> 10:41.371
retrieved from the victim's fingernails

10:41.408 --> 10:43.206
that matches scratches
on the accused's arm.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.993
The accused refused to leave.

10:45.085 --> 10:47.061
She grabbed an unopened
glass bottle of liquor,

10:47.098 --> 10:48.785
striking the back of the victim's head,

10:48.822 --> 10:50.635
fracturing the occipital bone

10:50.672 --> 10:54.065
and rupturing the
posterior meningeal artery.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.104
This was a violent crime of passion.

10:57.751 --> 10:59.648
The accused may not
have gone there to kill,

10:59.685 --> 11:01.710
but she wanted him to die.

11:02.997 --> 11:05.088
Therefore, the Crown seeks a
charge of second-degree murder,

11:05.125 --> 11:07.477
and the right to detain
Luna Spence without bail.

11:07.514 --> 11:09.035
Thank you.

11:09.421 --> 11:12.727
Your Honour, my client has
no previous criminal record.

11:12.764 --> 11:14.734
She has cooperated with
this investigation,

11:14.771 --> 11:17.673
but she denies the facts
as presented here.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.037
She is an exemplary student,

11:20.129 --> 11:22.214
a community volunteer and

11:22.259 --> 11:25.463
a cherished daughter,
sister and friend.

11:25.867 --> 11:29.549
Denying her bail is a
severe punitive measure.

11:29.586 --> 11:32.108
We request that the court
return her to her family

11:32.145 --> 11:35.461
and to her community while
she fights these charges.

11:35.498 --> 11:37.356
Your Honour, when the
accused was apprehended,

11:37.422 --> 11:40.388
she and her mother
were in a state of departure.

11:40.444 --> 11:42.660
And her girlfriend, Molly Ross,

11:42.697 --> 11:44.892
was the recipient of a
substantial financial settlement

11:44.929 --> 11:47.497
giving her the means and motive
to escape jurisdiction.

11:47.653 --> 11:50.122
She should be considered a flight risk.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.455
Given the chronology and the
opinion presented by the Crown,

11:56.779 --> 11:58.945
bail is denied. The
accused will be remanded

11:59.010 --> 12:02.136
to the Brockstone
Detention Centre to await trial.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.106
It's overwhelming, but they're throwing

12:37.143 --> 12:38.677
everything against the wall.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.858
They made my little girl
sound like some psycho killer!

12:40.895 --> 12:43.497
At a show cause hearing,
they can say anything,

12:43.534 --> 12:45.489
spin the facts however they want.

12:45.526 --> 12:47.299
What happens next?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.328
We get to work proving her innocence.

12:49.487 --> 12:52.307
I'm not a lawyer,
but you representing her

12:52.344 --> 12:54.638
seems like a conflict
of interest to me.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.526
I'm within my legal right
to represent Luna.

12:57.672 --> 13:00.090
You should go home, get some rest.

13:00.114 --> 13:02.850
Yeah, good luck with that.

13:02.951 --> 13:05.919
There's nothing more to do
right now. Just legal stuff.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.121
We'll call you the second that changes.

13:08.706 --> 13:10.223
OK.

13:19.101 --> 13:20.534
Are you sure you're up for this?

13:20.635 --> 13:22.970
The Manitoba Bar Association
might lay a heavy fine on me,

13:23.071 --> 13:25.625
but by then, Luna will be free.
That's not what I meant.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.474
I'm talking about a criminal lawyer,

13:27.511 --> 13:29.291
one with real trial experience.

13:29.402 --> 13:31.576
I'm trained and highly qualified

13:31.613 --> 13:33.277
- in all areas of the law.
- I don't doubt that...

13:33.314 --> 13:36.083
There is nothing that I won't
sacrifice to free my sister.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.252
I'm just wondering if there's
not a more suitable candidate.

13:38.289 --> 13:39.946
There's not!

13:40.574 --> 13:42.597
Name one lawyer

13:42.668 --> 13:45.025
who will outwork me on this case.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.443
Right.

13:50.943 --> 13:53.714
Every second Luna spends
in custody is too long.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.505
Find me in my office.

13:55.570 --> 13:57.138
We need to get all the evidence

13:57.175 --> 13:59.367
and find a way to bring her home.

14:00.087 --> 14:02.222
Meet me back at your office.

14:06.147 --> 14:07.900
- Mr. Bennett.
- Ms. Chang.

14:07.937 --> 14:09.950
I was hoping to acquire copies
of the Crown's evidence.

14:10.051 --> 14:11.829
- Now?
- As soon as possible.

14:11.869 --> 14:14.196
We literally just walked out
of the show cause.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.685
And disclosure is triggered
upon the request of the defense.

14:16.729 --> 14:18.026
Luna is innocent.

14:18.063 --> 14:19.803
She doesn't deserve to
be in a detention centre.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.528
All due respect,
don't you think you should

14:21.565 --> 14:23.872
slow down just a bit?
Getting that advice all day.

14:23.909 --> 14:26.406
I bet. We're still
processing everything,

14:26.443 --> 14:27.914
I don't even have
copies of anything yet.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.940
Please, she's my sister.

14:31.489 --> 14:33.473
Oh.

14:34.108 --> 14:36.743
I'm sorry. Um... OK,

14:36.780 --> 14:38.715
this is my copy of the Crown brief,

14:38.752 --> 14:41.287
and my office will reach out
to you with the rest of it

14:41.324 --> 14:43.959
in a week or so. If you'll excuse me...

15:08.310 --> 15:12.318
- Hi. I'm Luna.
- Don't touch any of my stuff.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.058
That's quite the read.

15:29.864 --> 15:31.999
It proves that Luna's innocent.

15:32.194 --> 15:34.001
I saw him alive,

15:34.102 --> 15:36.406
and I record everything accurately.

15:36.443 --> 15:38.839
I survive because of my precision.

15:38.940 --> 15:42.042
Mm-hmm. So you're saying
everything in here is accurate?

15:42.079 --> 15:45.453
Mhm. You've arrested the wrong person.

15:46.514 --> 15:49.216
David Hanley was alive
after the argument.

15:51.386 --> 15:53.865
Why did you come to Millwood
out of the blue?

15:55.835 --> 15:58.275
To see my father. He sent me a letter.

15:58.442 --> 16:00.653
Oh right, yeah, that's...

16:01.034 --> 16:02.968
that's in here.

16:03.082 --> 16:07.267
And you stayed at the motel
and... not with him.

16:07.491 --> 16:08.974
Yeah.

16:09.152 --> 16:12.005
I was mad at him,
I still am, but it's better.

16:12.106 --> 16:14.902
Aw... Patch things up?

16:17.545 --> 16:19.213
Um, after seeing the body,

16:19.250 --> 16:21.546
everything else just seems so...

16:21.861 --> 16:23.519
not important.

16:23.584 --> 16:25.767
And you somehow ended up in the room

16:25.804 --> 16:27.705
right next to Luna's father.

16:28.618 --> 16:30.692
- Excuse me?
- On your drive to Millwood,

16:30.729 --> 16:32.195
what did you and Luna talk about?

16:32.260 --> 16:34.828
Lots of things. I don't
remember off the top of my head.

16:34.865 --> 16:37.266
But you wrote it down, accurately?

16:37.519 --> 16:39.353
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.304 --> 16:45.795
"She wanted to put 'Scum of the Earth'

16:45.832 --> 16:48.514
"on her dad's gravestone.
With what he did,

16:48.551 --> 16:52.698
I'd be happy to help her
bury the body."

16:56.770 --> 16:59.363
You both drove to Millwood
to confront your fathers;

16:59.434 --> 17:02.289
whose idea was it to kill David Hanley?

17:07.589 --> 17:09.429
Her DNA was under his fingernails,

17:09.465 --> 17:12.101
but that doesn't necessarily
put her in the motel room.

17:12.138 --> 17:14.107
She told the police
she was in the room.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.258
We try to get that thrown out.
We argue Maitland.

17:17.361 --> 17:18.939
She didn't have time
and access to counsel.

17:19.133 --> 17:22.396
Except in the Maitland case,
the delay was 48 hours.

17:22.548 --> 17:24.310
That's worth a shot.

17:25.738 --> 17:28.079
What was she doing there?
She told me that she went

17:28.117 --> 17:30.018
to see Taylor and ran into my father.

17:30.055 --> 17:32.756
She didn't expect to see him.
That leads to an argument.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.286
He grabs her arm
to force her out of the room,

17:35.323 --> 17:36.873
scratches her. And she defends herself

17:36.910 --> 17:38.802
with the first thing she finds.
We argue self-defence.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.440
She swears that he was still
alive when she left the room.

17:41.536 --> 17:42.784
We can't argue self-defence

17:42.821 --> 17:44.197
if she denies being
there when it happened.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.768
She swears that she did not kill him.

17:49.186 --> 17:51.187
We need a single exonerating theory.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.203
If they can put her in the motel room,

17:53.240 --> 17:54.470
we can't say that they argued

17:54.507 --> 17:55.907
and then someone else
came in and killed them.

17:55.943 --> 17:58.250
We need to give them
another suspect, find a story

17:58.287 --> 18:00.788
that fits all the facts,
control the narrative.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.316
Right now, we don't control anything.

18:10.148 --> 18:12.082
- Doodlebug.
- Daddy.

18:14.762 --> 18:16.234
I got you.

18:16.321 --> 18:19.293
I don't understand what's
going on. Why can't I come home?

18:19.333 --> 18:21.668
Officer Mercer called me, and
he explained everything to me.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.970
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.879
Sit down, Taylor.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.630
You and Luna

18:33.829 --> 18:35.948
driving back together,

18:36.138 --> 18:39.286
they're calling that
conspiracy to commit murder.

18:40.721 --> 18:42.687
"Conspiracy"?

18:43.057 --> 18:45.058
We were joking.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.777
I believe you,

18:47.136 --> 18:50.209
but the police, um...

18:52.800 --> 18:54.503
They're entering your journal

18:54.540 --> 18:56.541
into evidence, honey.

19:00.241 --> 19:02.475
What's gonna happen to me?

19:06.180 --> 19:10.371
If you drove her to Millwood
and you had some plan,

19:10.408 --> 19:12.791
they will charge you.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.088
They can charge you with murder.

19:16.039 --> 19:17.498
And now...

19:17.573 --> 19:19.326
our lawyer's talking to them right now.

19:19.379 --> 19:22.166
- Billy Crawford is my lawyer.
- No, he is not.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.677
He's Luna's lawyer.

19:23.714 --> 19:25.534
It's a conflict of interest, Taylor.

19:25.571 --> 19:27.086
No, Dad. I wanna talk to him.

19:27.123 --> 19:28.979
You can't.

19:29.178 --> 19:32.205
You need to listen to me right now.

19:32.609 --> 19:34.723
You could go to jail.

19:35.806 --> 19:39.679
And now, they are willing
to stay the charges -

19:39.716 --> 19:41.670
that's a good thing -

19:41.872 --> 19:44.543
all you have to do
is testify against her.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.618
I can't do that.

19:47.910 --> 19:51.646
He was alive after she left.
Luna's innocent.

19:52.014 --> 19:54.694
It's Crawford's job to prove that.

19:55.630 --> 19:57.297
We need to think about you now.

20:04.305 --> 20:06.090
<i>Hey, Owen, tell me you got good news.</i>

20:06.127 --> 20:08.128
A witness has come forward.

20:08.335 --> 20:11.104
There's evidence Luna came to
Millwood to kill David Hanley.

20:11.476 --> 20:14.044
<i>No, I don't believe that.
She didn't plan this.</i>

20:14.394 --> 20:16.046
It's Taylor Matheson.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.984
Mercer's saying they might
have done it together.

20:18.169 --> 20:20.910
- Taylor and Luna?
- <i>I don't know all the specifics,</i>

20:20.947 --> 20:23.156
but they're gonna upgrade the charge.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.067
- She gives 'em premeditation.
- First degree murder.

20:27.171 --> 20:28.929
<i>Mercer's been grilling
Taylor all night.</i>

20:29.030 --> 20:32.432
Got her to amend her statement.
What exactly did Taylor say?

20:32.485 --> 20:34.887
I don't know, but nothing good.

20:35.036 --> 20:37.364
- Can we speak to Taylor?
- <i>I'm sorry, Joanna.</i>

20:37.401 --> 20:39.538
<i>I wish there was more I could do.</i>

20:49.474 --> 20:51.809
If she gets convicted, that's 25 years.

20:52.253 --> 20:54.195
We have to make sure that she doesn't.

20:55.716 --> 20:58.110
We need to be realistic.

20:59.575 --> 21:02.529
The Crown's case is strong,
and our responsibility

21:02.566 --> 21:05.697
- is to explore all options.
- A plea deal?

21:07.501 --> 21:08.933
Maybe.

21:09.313 --> 21:10.553
She'd have a record.

21:10.590 --> 21:14.056
- She's looking at 25 years.
- She's innocent, Billy.

21:14.687 --> 21:17.122
What if she's not?

21:22.339 --> 21:23.756
Joanna?

21:36.029 --> 21:39.598
Will you be quiet?

21:45.670 --> 21:48.236
I couldn't sleep my first night either.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.524
I imagined the stars on the ceiling,

21:55.883 --> 21:58.018
just like back home.

22:00.413 --> 22:02.381
Does it work?

22:04.125 --> 22:05.725
Not really.

22:27.799 --> 22:30.206
You know, this is why
I bought the place.

22:30.324 --> 22:33.293
As a way of washing away
all the stress.

22:34.132 --> 22:36.790
My dad used to take me
swimming around here.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.759
You remember? There was a rope swing.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.429
Yeah, it was down at the bend
by the old Irving place.

22:42.530 --> 22:45.432
He was always pointing out
potential liability issues.

22:45.533 --> 22:48.186
Lawyers are the worst.

22:48.924 --> 22:50.704
You know, at least,
he brought you out here.

22:50.823 --> 22:52.739
In his own way, he was trying.

22:53.604 --> 22:57.044
My dad, you couldn't get him
off his stool at The Boot.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.994
I like to think that we'll be
different with our kids.

23:03.597 --> 23:07.020
I think it's a generation
that will be better.

23:08.459 --> 23:11.454
Won't we just screw them up
in a different way?

23:11.938 --> 23:13.639
Probably.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.235
If Luna takes a deal,

23:22.272 --> 23:24.240
the cops will stop looking
for the real killer.

23:24.405 --> 23:26.239
Joanna, they never looked
to begin with.

23:29.124 --> 23:31.516
Are we really capable of doing this?

23:32.844 --> 23:34.592
You've done criminal cases before.

23:34.687 --> 23:37.174
Yeah. Bar fights, B & E,
nothing like this.

23:37.211 --> 23:39.053
I got an A+ in Criminal Law.

23:39.154 --> 23:43.066
It's first degree murder.
The victim's your father.

23:44.703 --> 23:46.570
And what about the voice-mail message?

23:47.536 --> 23:49.229
That's evidence. We destroyed it,

23:49.266 --> 23:50.490
we are both compromised.

23:50.527 --> 23:52.462
If we hand this case off
to another lawyer,

23:52.538 --> 23:55.160
we'll have to be witnesses
against Luna. I won't do that.

23:55.197 --> 23:56.549
We could lose our licenses.

23:56.586 --> 23:59.922
My sister is facing life in prison...

24:00.341 --> 24:02.642
my license isn't important.

24:16.142 --> 24:18.444
I'm so glad that you decided
to reach out and discuss

24:18.481 --> 24:20.578
a potential plea deal, Billy.
It's like you read my mind.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.661
I'm just here to see
what you'd be willing to offer.

24:22.698 --> 24:24.866
- No promises.
- Of course.

24:26.964 --> 24:29.465
You know I like to avoid trials.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.832
Yeah, they're expensive and...

24:31.972 --> 24:34.660
they're really messy.
Kind of like my first marriage.

24:35.752 --> 24:38.992
Murder 2, she serves 10.

24:39.029 --> 24:41.145
Those scratches were defence wounds.

24:41.407 --> 24:43.623
- You could argue self-defence.
- Man 1.

24:43.761 --> 24:45.991
18 months in a
minimum-security facility.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.313
18 months?

24:47.666 --> 24:49.719
You're upgrading
the charge to first degree.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.954
We got a witness that can
give us prior utterances.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.218
- Taylor Matheson.
- So that gives us premeditation,

24:54.255 --> 24:55.702
and remember, we got that DNA evidence.

24:55.773 --> 24:59.656
- And she's willing to testify?
- She doesn't want to go to jail.

24:59.894 --> 25:01.831
You threatened her with charges.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.465
She has a brain injury
that affects her memory.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.271
She won't survive cross.

25:07.137 --> 25:09.222
Man 1, 4 years,

25:09.277 --> 25:11.073
minimum security.

25:12.139 --> 25:14.610
OK. Take that to your client.

25:14.943 --> 25:18.481
You know, if she considers it,
maybe I'll consider it too.

25:18.741 --> 25:20.337
Hey, Billy,

25:20.586 --> 25:22.784
I need an answer in 24 hours.

25:41.654 --> 25:43.537
How are you holding up?

25:44.712 --> 25:48.376
We're doing everything that
we can to get you out of here.

25:48.598 --> 25:50.897
- Thank you.
- You're innocent,

25:50.934 --> 25:53.368
so we just have to prove it.

25:55.725 --> 25:57.834
You don't sound convinced.

25:59.047 --> 26:02.217
Taylor Matheson, she's saying you...

26:04.225 --> 26:07.199
Taylor told them
that you were planning it,

26:07.254 --> 26:09.288
that it's why you drove to Millwood.

26:11.409 --> 26:13.149
She's lying.

26:13.937 --> 26:16.192
- Why would she say that?
- Luna...

26:16.261 --> 26:18.329
- I didn't kill him.
- I know.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.942
Taylor Matheson is
no longer in custody,

26:32.979 --> 26:36.311
but Duffield asked me to help
him with her charging papers.

26:37.394 --> 26:39.295
He shouldn't have done that.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.831
Forgot to tell him
you were off the case.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.547
- Why are we charging her?
- We're not.

26:45.658 --> 26:48.520
Yet. We're just crossing our T's

26:48.604 --> 26:50.805
in case she doesn't cooperate.

26:51.253 --> 26:53.255
Either way, it's not your problem.

26:56.289 --> 26:57.829
Maybe it is.

27:01.382 --> 27:03.083
Well, I'm just not sure

27:03.120 --> 27:05.821
it's right threatening
an innocent girl with jail.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.139
How do you know she's innocent?

27:08.176 --> 27:09.892
They drove here together.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.027
<i>Thelma and Louise.</i>

27:12.329 --> 27:14.125
It's not your problem.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.900
You're ready to take
these juggernauts down?

27:53.138 --> 27:55.204
I don't know. Sports are
kind of more Molly's thing.

27:55.687 --> 27:57.206
Who's Molly?

27:57.307 --> 27:59.208
Uh, my girlfriend.

28:00.102 --> 28:01.869
Cool.

28:02.311 --> 28:04.468
Here's hoping she hangs
in there for you.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.449
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

28:06.994 --> 28:10.219
tough on a relationship, this.

28:10.494 --> 28:12.495
Come on.

28:14.436 --> 28:16.236
OK, game on!

28:24.219 --> 28:25.620
Hey, hey!

28:31.471 --> 28:33.226
Argh!

28:33.401 --> 28:35.411
- What the hell?!
- Yah!

28:35.448 --> 28:37.189
You OK?

28:40.406 --> 28:42.438
Offensive foul! Our ball.

28:42.475 --> 28:44.128
No way. The little bitch got in my way.

28:44.327 --> 28:45.521
Hey!

28:59.569 --> 29:01.270
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:01.371 --> 29:03.305
Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:03.406 --> 29:05.574
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:08.509 --> 29:10.283
Stupid bitch!

29:16.773 --> 29:18.045
<i>My dad's assistant sent</i>

29:18.082 --> 29:20.050
over his last banking transactions.

29:20.087 --> 29:22.619
- Same ones they sent the police.
- What am I looking at?

29:22.674 --> 29:24.899
3 p.m. He made
five consecutive withdrawals

29:24.936 --> 29:27.131
- of $1000 each time.
- Is that unusual?

29:27.194 --> 29:29.736
My dad loves cash, but that much?

29:29.829 --> 29:31.830
Maybe he was paying someone off.

29:33.621 --> 29:36.272
9:45 p.m.: purchase at the Liquor Mart

29:36.373 --> 29:39.679
made with his corporate card.
One bottle of McGachie scotch.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.468
The murder weapon.

29:43.742 --> 29:46.949
So, David was alive at 9:45 p.m.

29:47.451 --> 29:49.107
No one saw his car leave the motel.

29:49.144 --> 29:51.384
and it's at least a 10-minute
walk from the Liquor Mart.

29:51.455 --> 29:54.108
That's right on the bubble of
when they say Luna killed him.

29:54.210 --> 29:57.112
Still, doesn't prove she didn't do it.

29:59.039 --> 30:01.240
I spoke with the Crown.

30:03.697 --> 30:05.329
About a plea?

30:06.911 --> 30:10.312
Four years. Gerrilynn's
discussing it with her now.

30:10.349 --> 30:13.351
- I should be with them.
- She needs her mother.

30:17.661 --> 30:20.068
- Owen.
- Hey.

30:24.154 --> 30:26.155
I'd do anything for Luna.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.127
I'll leave you to it.

30:36.641 --> 30:38.323
I don't think you should look at these.

30:38.972 --> 30:41.036
Luna's freedom is
the only thing that matters now.

30:48.965 --> 30:50.588
You OK?

30:50.726 --> 30:52.748
You need to stop asking me that.

31:04.711 --> 31:06.560
What happened to you?

31:07.174 --> 31:08.342
It's nothing.

31:08.379 --> 31:10.367
It's not nothing, sweet pea.

31:10.404 --> 31:12.304
I can't lose you in here.
I lost you once already,

31:12.341 --> 31:14.442
and I'm not doing it again.

31:15.368 --> 31:17.021
When did you lose me, Mom?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.741
You were 4,

31:18.842 --> 31:20.491
and we got separated
at the Giant Tiger.

31:20.528 --> 31:23.763
- You don't remember?
- Yeah, I remember the story.

31:24.305 --> 31:26.181
I found you at the cashier,
and you had filled

31:26.218 --> 31:28.841
a cart full of things
we couldn't afford.

31:29.944 --> 31:33.055
- You're always my little dreamer.
- Yeah.

31:33.449 --> 31:35.346
Not anymore.

31:40.113 --> 31:41.947
I don't belong here.

31:44.905 --> 31:48.337
Everybody looks at me like I'm guilty.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.639
Oh, that's how they see us.

31:51.446 --> 31:53.447
If they even see us at all.

31:56.227 --> 31:59.682
I can't imagine
what you're going through, baby,

32:00.505 --> 32:02.306
but I see you.

32:03.446 --> 32:05.698
I know you're innocent,

32:06.050 --> 32:07.650
but, uh...

32:08.021 --> 32:10.289
there's a deal.

32:11.221 --> 32:14.267
It's an offer. Four years.

32:15.122 --> 32:16.529
I plead guilty?

32:16.582 --> 32:19.068
The deck is stacked against you,

32:19.307 --> 32:21.403
against people like us.

32:22.431 --> 32:23.654
You'd start counting down

32:23.691 --> 32:26.260
the four years tomorrow.
You could finish your degree.

32:26.586 --> 32:29.344
You want me to say I did it?

32:29.724 --> 32:31.791
I just want you home.

32:38.021 --> 32:39.588
I never thanked you for earlier.

32:40.212 --> 32:42.213
I didn't do it for you.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.014
How do you survive in here?

32:46.103 --> 32:48.197
I'm still waiting for my trial.

32:48.409 --> 32:50.399
How long have you been waiting?

32:51.038 --> 32:52.762
Almost three years.

32:52.881 --> 32:56.344
My case has had delay after delay.

32:57.299 --> 32:59.908
Have you never
considered a plea bargain?

33:00.788 --> 33:02.438
Turned it down

33:02.542 --> 33:04.213
on my lawyer's advice.

33:04.472 --> 33:06.419
He was legal aid.

33:06.883 --> 33:08.784
During the preliminary hearing,

33:08.969 --> 33:11.718
he was playing solitaire on his phone.

33:16.091 --> 33:18.280
You get what you pay for.

33:22.785 --> 33:25.701
My sister's my lawyer.

33:26.131 --> 33:27.736
Maybe you have a chance.

33:28.999 --> 33:31.874
I know she'd never give up on me.

33:32.519 --> 33:34.529
That sounds like hope.

33:35.378 --> 33:37.103
I miss that feeling.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.176
<i>We ended up replacing everything.</i>

33:47.213 --> 33:49.469
<i>I'm not sure
what you're hoping to find.</i>

33:51.369 --> 33:53.103
Thanks.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.199
<i>I just pushed my way in</i>

34:40.235 --> 34:42.971
<i>He wanted me to leave, but I wouldn't.</i>

34:43.190 --> 34:45.960
<i>He told me he gave my mom money.</i>

34:46.893 --> 34:48.359
<i>I told him I hated him,</i>

34:48.396 --> 34:50.500
<i>but he just stared back at me,</i>

34:50.536 --> 34:53.462
<i>disgusted that I even existed.</i>

35:00.424 --> 35:02.598
The fight took place
at the foot of the bed.

35:02.696 --> 35:04.204
Dad...

35:05.249 --> 35:06.881
David Hanley stood at the door

35:06.918 --> 35:08.886
attempting to contact the police.

35:08.923 --> 35:11.767
The accused pushed past the victim

35:11.804 --> 35:14.622
heading out the western egress.

35:14.659 --> 35:16.560
into the parking lot.

35:29.653 --> 35:31.851
I bet you needed a drink after that.

35:56.343 --> 35:58.681
We don't get a lot of time, Molly.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.869
I don't know what to say.

36:02.953 --> 36:06.411
It's me. Just talk to me.

36:13.818 --> 36:17.200
Molly, there's a deal.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.406
- If I plead guilty...
- But you didn't do it.

36:21.553 --> 36:23.353
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.358
You can't say you did it
when you didn't.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.752
If they find me guilty,

36:27.990 --> 36:32.038
I'd get 25 years. I could be out in 4.

36:32.075 --> 36:35.864
4? That's 4 too many, Luna.

36:37.941 --> 36:39.534
You're right.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.013
You're right.

36:46.596 --> 36:50.299
Whether it's 25 years or 4,

36:50.620 --> 36:53.002
we're not gonna survive this.

36:55.978 --> 36:57.678
What?

36:57.874 --> 37:01.544
We're not gonna make it
through this, Molly.

37:03.257 --> 37:05.792
Are you breaking up with me?

37:06.425 --> 37:08.838
Your life got suspended once already.

37:09.166 --> 37:11.834
I can't do that to you again.

37:11.871 --> 37:16.051
- Luna! You are!
- In a few years from now,

37:16.154 --> 37:19.862
when we're still sitting
in the same disgusting room,

37:20.150 --> 37:22.448
- you're gonna resent me.
- Never.

37:22.485 --> 37:24.419
And I wouldn't blame you, Molly.

37:25.853 --> 37:28.588
I think you should go.

37:29.398 --> 37:32.567
No. I can't do that.

37:32.843 --> 37:35.644
Baby, baby, it's me.

37:35.857 --> 37:37.883
- Luna...
- Don't.

37:38.735 --> 37:40.520
Just go.

37:41.070 --> 37:43.850
- No.
- GET OUT!

37:44.331 --> 37:48.259
- Guard?
- Baby... No.

37:49.239 --> 37:51.707
Baby, don't.

38:09.512 --> 38:11.260
Hi. I was wondering if I could look

38:11.297 --> 38:13.347
at your security camera footage
from Tuesday?

38:13.516 --> 38:15.254
Uh... no.

38:18.021 --> 38:21.290
- I am a lawyer...
- We erase it every 24 hours.

38:21.557 --> 38:23.726
Anything else I can help you with?

38:26.226 --> 38:30.192
Yeah. Can I buy a bottle
of McGachie, 16 years?

38:45.769 --> 38:48.804
The door on the parking lot side
was locked, so...

38:49.310 --> 38:51.049
<i>either he knew the killer, let him in</i>

38:51.086 --> 38:53.788
and then locks the door or...

38:56.312 --> 38:58.694
...the killer was already
inside the room.

39:12.237 --> 39:14.472
You were waiting for him to leave.

39:29.813 --> 39:34.043
- Can I get you anything?
- Were you working on Tuesday?

39:34.566 --> 39:36.732
The night that all
the cop cars showed up?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.156
Yeah, yeah. The murder.

39:38.193 --> 39:42.554
- Did you notice anyone unusual?
- Tuesday's usually pretty slow.

39:42.904 --> 39:44.673
There was a weird girl though.

39:44.774 --> 39:46.567
Sitting right around here actually.

39:46.663 --> 39:48.461
Her leg was going
like a sewing machine.

39:48.498 --> 39:51.000
I thought she was gonna
sneak a drink, so I ID'd her.

39:51.037 --> 39:53.804
- And that was unusual?
- No, but the ID stood out.

39:53.918 --> 39:56.086
It looked fake. From California.

39:56.322 --> 39:58.323
Was that the woman that you saw?

39:58.409 --> 40:00.963
No. That's the girl the cops showed me.

40:01.121 --> 40:03.489
Definitely wasn't her.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.459
Are you gonna take the plea?

40:20.496 --> 40:22.404
You don't think I should?

40:22.591 --> 40:24.668
It's your decision, Luna.

40:25.723 --> 40:26.969
There was another woman.

40:27.014 --> 40:29.087
She might have been waiting for him.

40:29.832 --> 40:31.352
It's just a theory.

40:31.389 --> 40:33.590
I know I didn't do it,

40:33.683 --> 40:36.483
which means someone out there did.

40:37.429 --> 40:40.631
- If anyone can figure it out...
- I will search

40:40.723 --> 40:43.553
day and night if that's what you want,

40:44.369 --> 40:47.505
but I can't guarantee
that I will find anything.

40:54.797 --> 40:56.898
I don't know what to do.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.373
OK. On paper, this plea

40:59.410 --> 41:04.837
is pretty simple math: 4 years
is objectively fewer than 25,

41:04.874 --> 41:06.793
if you're convicted.

41:07.474 --> 41:08.857
OK.

41:09.883 --> 41:12.219
What are my chances at trial?

41:12.296 --> 41:14.292
No, I won't wager on your life, Luna.

41:14.345 --> 41:16.480
It's a strong case.

41:16.620 --> 41:19.599
But if you take the plea,

41:19.917 --> 41:23.196
you will always have a record.
That doesn't go away.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.155
And it will change you.

41:33.878 --> 41:35.512
I'm scared.

41:36.295 --> 41:37.851
I want you to know

41:37.964 --> 41:41.640
that whatever way you go
with this, I am here for you.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.751
- OK?
- OK.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.772
I will be in that courtroom today

41:49.039 --> 41:51.040
right by your side.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.405
All rise.

42:16.624 --> 42:19.927
Please be seated.

42:21.588 --> 42:23.225
I understand a plea agreement

42:23.262 --> 42:25.799
has been reached between
the accused and the Crown.

42:25.836 --> 42:27.021
It has, Your Honour.

42:27.058 --> 42:29.505
We are recommending
a charge of manslaughter

42:29.542 --> 42:31.578
with a custodial sentence of four years

42:31.615 --> 42:33.950
to be served
in a minimum-security facility.

42:35.544 --> 42:37.685
If there's anything you'd like
to say before the Crown

42:37.722 --> 42:39.780
considers the plea agreement...

42:53.398 --> 42:55.299
I didn't do it.

42:55.638 --> 42:58.173
Excuse me?

43:05.578 --> 43:08.271
I didn't kill David Hanley.

43:08.856 --> 43:10.890
To clarify for the court,

43:11.007 --> 43:13.378
are you rejecting the arranged deal

43:13.415 --> 43:15.809
and entering a plea of not guilty?

43:37.874 --> 43:39.509
I am not guilty.
