00:30.697 --> 00:32.031
<i> I'm 16..</i>

00:33.433 --> 00:34.666
<i> ...already in trouble</i>
<i> at school</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.870
<i> and unfortunately</i>
<i> have blond hair.</i>

00:37.872 --> 00:39.772
<i> My mother liked to joke</i>
<i> that natural blonds</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:41.573
<i> were usually selfish</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:43.909
<i> while dyed blonds</i>
<i> were pathological liars.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:46.812
<i> Jim is my twin.</i>

00:46.814 --> 00:48.814
<i> My only true friend.</i>

00:48.816 --> 00:50.749
<i> Jim was the one person</i>
<i> in the whole world</i>

00:50.751 --> 00:52.751
<i> I could really talk to.</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:54.953
<i> Who I felt</i>
<i> comfortable with.</i>

00:54.955 --> 00:56.855
<i> That may sound</i>
<i> kind of fucked up</i>

00:56.857 --> 00:58.023
<i> but it's a twin thing.</i>

00:58.025 --> 01:00.559
Don't worry, someday
your hair will be brown

01:00.561 --> 01:02.895
like mine and then people
will finally take you

01:02.897 --> 01:04.629
seriously
and then it'll turn grey.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.166
And they won't.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.468
<i> In every family,</i>
<i> there was that one person</i>

01:09.470 --> 01:11.703
<i> that was the glue that</i>
<i> held it all together.</i>

01:11.705 --> 01:13.539
<i> That was Jim.</i>

01:13.541 --> 01:15.040
<i> He was the one</i>
<i> who could cheer mom up</i>

01:15.042 --> 01:17.142
<i> when she got down.</i>

01:17.144 --> 01:19.211
<i> That brought out</i>
<i> something different</i>
<i> in her.</i>

01:23.483 --> 01:26.852
<i> We'd just moved from</i>
<i> Michigan to palos verdes.</i>

01:26.854 --> 01:28.587
<i> You see, it was always</i>
<i> my father's dream</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:30.222
<i> to move to California.</i>

01:30.224 --> 01:32.791
<i> To be a heart surgeon</i>
<i> to the rich and famous.</i>

01:37.897 --> 01:40.065
<i> My mother wasn't sure</i>
<i> at first about moving.</i>

01:41.701 --> 01:43.635
<i> She said she was allergic</i>
<i> to all the Botox</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:45.537
<i> earthquakes</i>
<i> and exercise.</i>

01:45.539 --> 01:47.940
<i> But my dad insisted</i>
<i> that the sunshine</i>
<i> and sea air</i>

01:47.942 --> 01:50.742
<i> was just what</i>
<i> the doctor ordered..</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:52.411
<i> ...the doctor</i>
<i> being him.</i>

01:52.413 --> 01:54.113
How's that pool?

01:54.115 --> 01:56.348
Whoa, don't get
the new house wet!

01:56.350 --> 01:59.051
Not on --
not on the first day.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.652
Oh, look at this.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.521
I couldn't believe
they were selling

02:02.523 --> 02:04.756
mass-produced buddhas
at the drugstore.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.059
- I'll take a regular.
- Here you go.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.961
Thank you.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.128
Oh.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.464
Hey, I think
i see a whale.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.299
- <i> No way.</i>
<i>- I do!</i>

02:19.539 --> 02:22.274
<i> Right there,</i>
<i> below the seaweed.</i>

02:22.276 --> 02:24.309
- I don't see anything.
- Look.

02:25.845 --> 02:29.281
- To new beginnings.
- To sunshine!

02:29.283 --> 02:32.651
- To sunscreen.
- To us.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.356
Which us?

02:41.361 --> 02:42.694
All of us.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.366
I always said we'd move
to paradise, didn't I?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.601
- Yeah.
- Let's go down here.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.702
I'm gonna throw you
in the ocean.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.171
<i> In school,</i>
<i> we learned about people</i>

02:52.173 --> 02:53.572
<i> who came west</i>
<i> in wagon trains</i>

02:53.574 --> 02:55.374
<i> to start new lives.</i>

02:55.376 --> 02:57.943
<i> So did my family.</i>

02:57.945 --> 03:00.412
<i> Even my mom was doing</i>
<i> her best to be hopeful.</i>

03:01.881 --> 03:03.549
<i> So vast.</i>

03:05.585 --> 03:06.785
Yeah.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.853
<i> We're gonna be</i>
<i> happy here.</i>

03:07.855 --> 03:08.921
<i> Yup.</i>

03:08.923 --> 03:11.323
Well, I'm happy already.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.325
This is so goddamn vast.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.398
<i> I wish I could go back</i>
<i> and hold on</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:21.533
<i> to that moment forever</i>

03:21.535 --> 03:24.036
<i> and just be happy for</i>
<i> everything that we had.</i>

03:46.392 --> 03:47.893
- Hey, Phil.
- What?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.462
- Let's not go tonight.
- What?

03:50.464 --> 03:52.064
Let's stay home.
Let's stay home.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.434
Phil, let's stay home.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.704
It's important to go out,
meet new people.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.473
This party is, you know,
to welcome us.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.976
Well, it's also important
to stay home

04:03.978 --> 04:06.311
and make this our home
and fill it with memories.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.813
- I know.
- Yeah.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.148
But we already said,
we have to go.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.884
- Oh.
- Give me a little more.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.820
- Mm, no.
- Come on.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.021
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.221
- Look --
- what?

04:17.224 --> 04:18.257
If you want me
to get ready

04:18.259 --> 04:19.558
I have to get ready.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.227
We're gonna be late
to your important party

04:22.229 --> 04:24.696
and your spray tan's
rubbing off on me.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.677
- Phil. Hi.
- Oh, my god.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.711
So great to see you.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.281
- Ava, hello. Hello.
- Hi. Hi.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.849
Oh. My wife, Sandy.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.883
- Hi, Sandy.
- Ava.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.652
- This is exciting.
- Yes.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.153
- Fiesta.
- This your first night?

04:48.155 --> 04:49.621
- <i> It's our first fiesta.</i>
<i>- At the club? Yes.</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:51.490
- <i> Do you like the house?</i>
<i>- Oh, my god.</i>

04:51.492 --> 04:52.791
- <i> Oh.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

04:58.031 --> 04:59.765
So you're
a cardiologist?

04:59.767 --> 05:00.932
Yes.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.135
I read all about you
in the "best doctors."

05:03.137 --> 05:05.504
You invented
that cardiovalvola, right?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.339
I'm impressed.
You've done your research.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.941
Well, I used to work
as a drug rep.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.377
I tell ya,
when you've held

05:12.379 --> 05:14.513
a, a beating
human heart --

05:14.515 --> 05:15.747
excuse me.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.982
I can't even look
at raw liver.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.317
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> I'm totally vegan.</i>

05:19.719 --> 05:21.520
- I'm Jim.
- Nice to meet you.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.855
It's nice to meet you.
I like this.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.290
Oh, thank you.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.892
<i> Uh, welcome</i>
<i> to the club.</i>

05:26.894 --> 05:27.959
<i> Thanks.</i>

05:27.961 --> 05:29.294
<i> You just moved to town?</i>

05:29.296 --> 05:31.596
Are your kids here?

05:31.598 --> 05:34.266
Uh, yeah,
they're here somewhere.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.600
That's what
we love about the club.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.469
<i> We never have to worry</i>
<i> about them.</i>

05:37.471 --> 05:38.537
Oh.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.078
Let's go home.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.413
Let the kids hang out
with their new friends.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.183
Could you just,
just try to act

05:51.185 --> 05:52.951
like you're having a good
time, alright, baby?

05:56.456 --> 05:58.757
- I am trying.
- Okay.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.894
I don't know
if these Xanax

06:02.896 --> 06:04.196
are even
working anymore.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.731
Maybe ease up
on the taquitos.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.134
They work better on a,
on an empty stomach,
alright?

06:25.184 --> 06:27.786
Let me guess, your father
is a, a finalist

06:27.788 --> 06:29.388
in the limbo
competition.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.256
Yup.
He's wearing a sombrero.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.391
I knew it.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.661
So I was reading
this thing about

06:36.663 --> 06:39.664
how whales go to Mexico
to have their calves

06:39.666 --> 06:42.334
and then they travel
back with them.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.535
But they have
these half-day trips.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.604
We can go out on boats
and you can see them.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.806
Oh, honey,
6 hours on a boat?

06:47.808 --> 06:50.709
Oh, god,
you'd die of boredom

06:50.711 --> 06:53.412
and seasickness.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.814
Yeah, it'll be probably
pretty lame anyways.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.151
<i> Look at Jim.</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:02.487
<i> He does take</i>
<i> after his father.</i>

07:05.258 --> 07:07.292
I don't know
who you take after.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.428
You -- you're..

07:09.430 --> 07:11.496
...your own
special person, honey.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.865
That's good.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.138
Hm.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.642
I'll go find <i> El senor.</i>

07:23.644 --> 07:25.811
<i> Oh, get us out of here.</i>

07:39.025 --> 07:40.725
<i> We learned at school</i>
<i> about the tribes</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:43.495
<i> that originally</i>
<i> inhabited pv.</i>

07:43.497 --> 07:47.265
<i> The chumash and the Tonga</i>
<i> native American tribes.</i>

07:47.267 --> 07:49.367
<i> There are new tribes now,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

07:55.842 --> 07:57.876
Hey, what's up
with your sister?

07:57.878 --> 08:00.212
Why doesn't she come
hang out with us?

08:00.214 --> 08:02.414
<i> My father said things</i>
<i> would be different here.</i>

08:02.416 --> 08:04.983
<i> But I knew Jim would</i>
<i> want to be popular</i>

08:04.985 --> 08:07.252
<i> and I wouldn't.</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:09.688
Oh, she just does
her own thing.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.122
That's cool.
That's cool.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.024
Yeah. She's awesome.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.396
<i> Phone down in the back,</i>
<i> please.</i>

08:18.398 --> 08:20.565
<i> Anybody offer</i>
<i> any opinions?</i>
<i> Do you remember?</i>

08:20.567 --> 08:22.400
<i> Does this ring a bell,</i>
<i> the word mana</i>

08:22.402 --> 08:25.470
<i> when we studied proper Asia</i>
<i> and polynesia?</i>

08:26.772 --> 08:28.440
<i> Their society</i>
<i> was structured..</i>

08:28.442 --> 08:29.608
Hey, wait up!

08:33.980 --> 08:37.182
<i> Property always sold</i>
<i> fast in palos verdes.</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:38.482
<i> People liked</i>
<i> that the grass</i>

08:38.485 --> 08:41.419
<i> had to be kept green</i>
<i> and cut attractively</i>

08:41.421 --> 08:42.621
<i> that the walls</i>
<i> of each house</i>

08:42.623 --> 08:44.890
<i> had to be painted</i>
<i> every 3 years</i>

08:44.892 --> 08:46.391
<i> and that the buildings</i>
<i> were required</i>

08:46.393 --> 08:48.193
<i> to have tiled roofs.</i>

08:53.266 --> 08:55.066
<i> The beaches</i>
<i> were maintained daily</i>

08:55.068 --> 08:57.168
<i> with special machines</i>
<i> to clean the sand</i>

08:57.170 --> 08:59.004
<i> and thresh, mix</i>
<i> and spit it out</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:01.339
<i> into crystals of</i>
<i> immaculate white powder.</i>

09:02.842 --> 09:04.676
<i> The police knew</i>
<i> each family by name</i>

09:04.678 --> 09:07.445
<i> and by make and model</i>
<i> of their car.</i>

09:07.447 --> 09:09.381
<i> There were no lights</i>
<i> on the football stadium</i>

09:09.383 --> 09:10.982
<i> because the locals</i>
<i> didn't want anyone</i>

09:10.984 --> 09:13.018
<i> from out of town</i>
<i> there after dark</i>

09:13.020 --> 09:15.487
<i> or anywhere in pv,</i>
<i> really.</i>

09:15.489 --> 09:16.721
<i> The beaches</i>
<i> were not private</i>

09:16.723 --> 09:18.256
<i> but they might</i>
<i> as well be.</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:20.091
<i> The residents didn't</i>
<i> want any outsiders</i>

09:20.093 --> 09:22.160
<i> ruining their zillion</i>
<i> dollar views either.</i>

09:23.229 --> 09:24.462
<i> There were</i>
<i> no streetlights</i>

09:24.464 --> 09:26.798
<i> fast food stands</i>
<i> or apartment buildings.</i>

09:26.800 --> 09:29.401
<i> All outlawed</i>
<i> by the city ordinance.</i>

09:32.772 --> 09:36.508
<i> A chaos of stars</i>
<i> filled the skies</i>
<i> of palos verdes.</i>

09:36.510 --> 09:38.677
<i> But everything else</i>
<i> was regulated.</i>

10:15.514 --> 10:16.881
Wow.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.067
- Whoo!
- Hey! Hey!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.903
Hey, keep it down!

10:39.905 --> 10:41.873
<i> Do you know</i>
<i> how late it is?</i>

10:41.875 --> 10:44.409
<i> Oi, lady.</i>
<i> Go back inside.</i>

10:44.411 --> 10:46.311
<i> I'm gonna</i>
<i> call the police.</i>

10:46.313 --> 10:48.513
<i> Go away!</i>

10:48.515 --> 10:50.815
<i> Don't be bothering</i>
<i> 'cause we'll be louder!</i>

11:31.590 --> 11:34.592
10 whole seconds,
no turning.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.228
Don't get up.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.348
What the hell?

11:57.350 --> 12:00.251
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't worry about it.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.390
We should get another one.
Let's ask mom.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.694
- Do you really want one?
- Yeah.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.398
We don't need
to ask mom.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.489
Nah, people will laugh.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.491
Maybe we should go
somewhere else.

12:41.293 --> 12:42.961
Don't be such a baby.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.156
<i> When we were kids,</i>
<i> Jim and I had a treehouse</i>

13:11.158 --> 13:13.024
<i> in our backyard.</i>

13:13.026 --> 13:14.225
<i> We'd pull up the ladder</i>

13:14.227 --> 13:16.761
<i> and no one</i>
<i> could get to us.</i>

13:16.763 --> 13:17.862
<i> I always liked it best</i>

13:17.864 --> 13:19.531
<i> when it was just</i>
<i> the two of us.</i>

13:20.900 --> 13:23.368
<i> For the first time</i>
<i> in a long time</i>

13:23.370 --> 13:25.203
<i> it felt like we were</i>
<i> in our treehouse again.</i>

13:47.527 --> 13:49.627
Shit. It's the bayboys.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.797
Keep it cool.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.203
Hey, where you going?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.370
Just takin'
my son surfing.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.705
Yeah. Are you?

14:00.707 --> 14:01.773
Dad, let's just go
somewhere else.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.174
No, no, no. It's okay.
Look, dude.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.776
<i> We're not gonna be</i>
<i> in your way.</i>

14:04.778 --> 14:06.311
<i> I don't wanna</i>
<i> put you down</i>
<i> in front of your son.</i>

14:06.313 --> 14:07.745
- <i> Really?</i>
<i>- Get the fuck out.</i>

14:07.747 --> 14:09.681
- Dad, let's just go --
- beat it.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.318
What are you guys
starin' at?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.223
Shit.
Got out just in time.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.958
They don't own
the waves.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.026
Actually, they do.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.897
That guy Chad

14:25.899 --> 14:28.666
his stepbrother, Alex,
is in my math class.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.468
He's never there.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.770
Chad's like 30 years old

14:32.772 --> 14:34.172
and he still lives
at home.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.517
Well?

14:46.519 --> 14:47.886
Oh, baby.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.721
Wow, mom.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.222
<i> Digging the green.</i>

14:51.224 --> 14:52.490
I feel like Peter Pan.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.494
<i> Mm. Mm.</i>

14:56.496 --> 14:59.731
I can't believe
you moved us to a town
where grownup women

14:59.733 --> 15:03.001
wear green tennis dresses
on purpose.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.838
Oh, look at this.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.806
"Do you have the face
you deserve after 30?

15:08.808 --> 15:10.808
Welcome
to the ageless future."

15:10.810 --> 15:12.810
I have the perfect
anti-aging solution.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.612
It's called death.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.414
-<i> Come on.</i>
- Wow, mom, that's dark.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.683
<i> You're beautiful</i>
<i> and when the time comes</i>

15:18.685 --> 15:20.051
<i> I know</i>
<i> plenty of doctors --</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:22.420
- oh, god.
- God, dad, really?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.355
- Oh, yeah.
- If that's what you want.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.292
I'm gonna be late tonight.
I have a late consult.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.960
<i> Have fun</i>
<i> at the club today.</i>

15:28.962 --> 15:30.862
<i> Maybe invite</i>
<i> some of the girls</i>

15:30.864 --> 15:32.597
for, uh, barbecue
this weekend.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.365
<i> That would be fun,</i>
<i> right, kids?</i>

15:34.367 --> 15:37.235
<i> You could invite</i>
<i> some friends, too,</i>
<i> if you want.</i>

15:37.237 --> 15:39.938
Bibb salad
with the dressing
on the side.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.906
Chopped salad for me,
no dressing.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.477
I'll have a cheeseburger
and fries, please.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.414
You must have
a fantastic metabolism.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.850
Oh, well, I'll tell you
my metabolism secret.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.553
Smoking.
It makes you poop.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.656
<i> Cleans you out.</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:04.963
I'm joking.
I'm just joking.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.734
<i> Phil and I just,</i>
<i> we like, we like to joke.</i>

16:09.736 --> 16:12.603
Sorry, not lunchtime
appropriate.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.640
So how are you liking
our little slice
of paradise here?

16:20.546 --> 16:22.313
It's the waves.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.316
I mean, they're so loud.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.585
They're in -- incessant.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.388
I -- I can't sleep.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.324
And the surfers drag
their surfboards

16:33.326 --> 16:35.893
over the ice plant
and ruin everything.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.963
And why do your kids
roam around in packs

16:38.965 --> 16:40.264
stand at the edge
of cliffs

16:40.266 --> 16:42.600
like little
praying mantises?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.769
What's wrong with them?

16:51.477 --> 16:53.277
<i> I'm sorry, but Dr. Mason</i>
<i> isn't currently</i>

16:53.279 --> 16:54.912
<i> in the office.</i>

16:54.914 --> 16:56.848
Really? He's not there?

16:56.850 --> 16:58.649
<i> I could take a message</i>
<i> for you or --</i>

16:58.651 --> 17:00.985
he said he had
a late procedure.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.320
<i> No, ma'am.</i>
<i> He left at 4:00 P.M.</i>

17:02.322 --> 17:03.554
I see.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.623
<i> He said he was leaving</i>
<i> early today.</i>

17:05.625 --> 17:07.959
<i> I'll go ahead</i>
<i> and put a message in</i>
<i> that you called.</i>

17:07.961 --> 17:10.127
Well, thank you.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.597
<i> No problem, Mrs. Mason.</i>

17:12.598 --> 17:15.133
I guess the heart disease
just cleared on up.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.853
Okay. Okay.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.988
Mom?

17:39.625 --> 17:41.859
I need you to sign
something for school.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.164
You're so young
and pretty.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.571
Find someone
who loves you

17:53.573 --> 17:55.840
for who you are
on the inside

17:55.842 --> 17:57.008
not your face.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.212
People get tired
of faces.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.758
<i> You guys want juice?</i>

19:24.062 --> 19:25.897
<i> Fuck.</i>

19:25.899 --> 19:28.366
<i> Hey, what the hell's</i>
<i> going on?</i>

19:28.368 --> 19:30.735
<i> This isn't good.</i>
<i> This -- this,</i>
<i> it's not healthy.</i>

19:30.737 --> 19:33.271
<i> I'm not sure my health</i>
<i> is a, was a real issue --</i>

19:33.273 --> 19:34.939
<i> well, I'm a doctor.</i>
<i> Health is something</i>

19:34.941 --> 19:36.073
that I know a thing
or two about.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.241
You don't care
about my health.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.442
You care about
my cheekbones --

19:38.444 --> 19:42.680
I care about your goddamn
black hole moods.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.049
<i> How you suck us in.</i>

19:45.051 --> 19:49.587
<i> And sometimes,</i>
<i> Sandy, I swear --</i>

19:49.589 --> 19:50.755
<i> swear what?</i>

19:52.457 --> 19:54.058
<i> I swear what?</i>

20:06.338 --> 20:08.940
You'd feel so much
better if you just
got dressed..

20:10.142 --> 20:11.475
...and went out.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.325
Mom's really losin' it,
isn't she?

20:28.594 --> 20:30.194
She's not.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.664
She's just..

20:35.067 --> 20:37.401
...alone here, you know?

20:38.937 --> 20:41.105
And those pathetic plastic
people don't like her

20:41.107 --> 20:43.241
and dad rags on her
all the time.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.115
Oh, shit.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.117
Come on,
let's get out there.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.656
What's that?

20:58.658 --> 21:00.658
- Huh?
- What is that?

21:02.294 --> 21:03.761
A marijuana cigarette?

21:05.030 --> 21:07.598
- What?
- Give me that thing.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.534
Let's see it. Thanks.

21:10.536 --> 21:13.037
- Here we go, boys.
- You got a deal.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.239
- <i> Thank you.</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

21:15.241 --> 21:17.208
<i> You actually live here</i>
<i> or you just surf here?</i>

21:17.210 --> 21:18.576
<i> Just stay on the inside,</i>
<i> okay?</i>

21:18.578 --> 21:21.112
Don't snake our waves.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.513
- Yeah.
-<i> Yeah?</i>

21:22.515 --> 21:24.148
Of course. Yeah.

21:26.518 --> 21:27.685
<i> Who's that out there?</i>

21:29.021 --> 21:31.422
That's my sister,
actually.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.958
<i> Out there, boys.</i>

21:41.767 --> 21:43.868
These assholes
keeps multiplying, man.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.445
<i> The bayboys had all</i>
<i> these ridiculous rules</i>

21:54.447 --> 21:56.714
<i> that Jim wanted us</i>
<i> to follow.</i>

21:56.716 --> 21:58.949
<i> For the bayboys,</i>
<i> the more you tried</i>
<i> to look like a surfer</i>

21:58.951 --> 22:01.118
<i> the less of a surfer</i>
<i> you were.</i>

22:01.120 --> 22:02.753
<i> They never wore</i>
<i> colored wetsuits</i>

22:02.755 --> 22:05.956
<i> or anything bright,</i>
<i> modern or neon.</i>

22:05.958 --> 22:08.492
<i> They rode retro boards</i>
<i> and didn't do tricks</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:10.328
<i> or fancy stunts.</i>

22:10.330 --> 22:12.263
<i> You just rode waves.</i>

22:12.265 --> 22:15.166
<i> You rode</i>
<i> and you didn't fall off.</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:18.169
<i> I didn't care what anyone</i>
<i> wore or how they rode.</i>

22:18.171 --> 22:20.137
<i> I just wanted to surf.</i>

22:20.139 --> 22:22.106
<i> The boys would tell me</i>
<i> I had to wait in line</i>

22:22.108 --> 22:25.042
<i> behind them</i>
<i> and not to snake waves.</i>

22:25.044 --> 22:26.377
<i> They would tell me</i>
<i> I should stick</i>

22:26.379 --> 22:27.745
<i> to cheerleading</i>
<i> or ballet.</i>

22:27.747 --> 22:29.613
<i> But I didn't let it</i>
<i> bother me.</i>

22:29.615 --> 22:30.648
Hey, don't get
too close to her.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.216
I think she's on the rag

22:32.218 --> 22:33.718
like that old sharkie.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.152
<i> They warned me</i>
<i> to wait my turn</i>

22:35.154 --> 22:37.054
<i> and to not take</i>
<i> their waves</i>

22:37.056 --> 22:38.456
<i> but I didn't listen.</i>

22:38.458 --> 22:40.358
<i> I went in front,</i>
<i> first, behind</i>

22:40.360 --> 22:42.093
<i> over the top,</i>
<i> it didn't matter.</i>

22:42.095 --> 22:44.095
<i> You only get a turn</i>
<i> if you fight for one.</i>

24:06.378 --> 24:07.812
Chanel.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.353
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.556
I knew it. I knew it.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.227
<i> I knew it.</i>

24:35.006 --> 24:36.073
Hey.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.878
- I have an announcement.
- Oh.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.280
We're gonna start
a new life.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.983
I'm no longer
gonna be fake.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.485
The ladies
of palos verdes

24:47.487 --> 24:48.819
can take
their perfect lives

24:48.821 --> 24:50.488
and shove it up
their asses.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.424
No tennis clothes.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.892
No lancome hydrate.

24:54.894 --> 24:58.062
No balanced meals.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.130
We are gonna move
to Blaine, Minnesota

25:00.132 --> 25:01.599
where the women don't
wear tennis skirts

25:01.601 --> 25:03.701
and you won't be faced
with so much temptation.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.769
Uh, I can't leave here.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.905
I have a job.
I have patients.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.674
Fine. I'll take the kids.
Go pack. Go pack!

25:10.676 --> 25:12.877
I'm not going
to fucking Minnesota.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.144
It's just you and me
then, Jim.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.813
-<i> Alright.</i>
- Hey!

25:17.949 --> 25:20.017
- What's going on?
-<i> Damn it, Phil.</i>

25:20.019 --> 25:22.820
<i> Jim's friend saw you</i>
<i> having lunch with her.</i>

25:22.822 --> 25:24.355
She saw you!

25:24.357 --> 25:25.623
- You know who I mean.
- I don't.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.592
Okay. Okay.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.095
Uh, uh, what are you
talkin' about?

25:31.097 --> 25:34.231
I eat lunch all the time
with nurses

25:34.233 --> 25:35.733
or pharmaceutical
salesmen --

25:35.735 --> 25:38.035
or cute
little tennis ladies.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.436
I spoke to a lawyer.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.505
Jim, can you pack,
please? Can we get ready?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.842
Seriously?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.911
Is it, you -- you wanna
leave with your mom?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.612
You're a liar.

25:48.614 --> 25:51.081
You said things
would be different.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.083
Why don't you just
go fuck another nurse?

26:00.725 --> 26:01.792
Jim.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.462
- Jim, wait!
- What?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.534
You wouldn't actually
go with mom, would you?

26:10.536 --> 26:13.337
Oh, come on, Medina.
Where's she gonna go?

26:13.339 --> 26:15.339
She never leaves
the house.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.942
Look, she's just putting
that asshole

26:17.944 --> 26:19.543
on notice, okay?

26:49.474 --> 26:51.709
<i> Got these from the,</i>
<i> uh, Korean booth.</i>

26:51.711 --> 26:53.444
- They're oxycontin.
- Yeah.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.612
Here, take one.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.895
Do it. Do it.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.898
Ah, gross.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.668
- Aah.
- So gross.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.903
No, you don't need anymore.
Don't drink anymore.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.905
Taking you away
from here, come on.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.468
Think your mom should stop
the flashlight.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.270
Looks like
a fucking lighthouse.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.506
Yeah, she's always pacing
around in her robe
up there.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.007
It's fucking spooky.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.248
Watch this.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.083
<i> Jim!</i>

28:07.285 --> 28:09.053
- What the fuck?
- Go, go, go!

28:23.702 --> 28:24.968
Alright, Jimmy!

28:25.970 --> 28:27.705
Fucking epic!

28:50.562 --> 28:53.197
It was stupid
what you did.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.531
Yeah.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.167
I was pretty wasted.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.342
No. Annoying.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.921
Imagine the
waves in Bali.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.424
Or Fiji.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.660
We should go there
someday.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.798
That would be so cool.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.269
Surfing there
in huge waves.

29:38.676 --> 29:39.977
Let's take a break.

29:47.652 --> 29:50.320
Why are you and mom
still fighting?

29:50.322 --> 29:52.956
It's kind of complicated.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.293
Um, we got married
so young, you know?

29:58.396 --> 29:59.596
I don't know,
maybe you're not supposed

29:59.598 --> 30:02.766
to be with the same person
your whole life.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.835
But honestly,
i think that your mom

30:04.837 --> 30:06.904
would be happier
without me..

30:08.173 --> 30:09.673
...in the long run.

30:15.246 --> 30:16.580
Are you serious?

30:17.916 --> 30:19.716
Well, it's complicated.
Um..

30:21.753 --> 30:23.253
Something happened.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.356
I met someone.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.091
I mean,
I've fallen in love.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.794
She's a terrific lady.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.696
It's our
real estate agent.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.131
- What?
- It's Ava.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.632
It was
a complete surprise.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.501
- I never expected it.
- What?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.570
I'm so sorry, babe.
I'm so sorry.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.340
- Oh, my god.
- What?

30:43.342 --> 30:44.608
I'm sorry, honey.

30:46.077 --> 30:48.111
I have another chance
to be happy now.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.947
Another chance
at my life.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.115
Baby, I gotta take it.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.151
You understand that,
right?

30:54.153 --> 30:56.920
Dad, you can't just leave.
That's not fair.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.426
We're gonna come and stay
with you, right?

31:02.428 --> 31:03.760
Of course. No, no, no.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.230
Ava and I have already
talked about that.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.166
Thing is, um,
she has a son, Adrian.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.235
So she just wants to wait
until she feels

31:11.237 --> 31:14.004
a little more secure
in our relationship.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.141
Honey, we're gonna be
together all the time.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.944
It's gonna be terrific.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.413
I just need
your support on this.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.515
Especially when
i tell your mom.

31:31.589 --> 31:32.823
Goddammit.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.084
Where would you like
to start with sorry --

32:01.086 --> 32:02.653
it doesn't have anything
to do with your friends.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.054
Would you like
to start with sorry?

32:04.056 --> 32:05.555
Did you find somebody
skinnier than me?

32:05.557 --> 32:07.257
Did you find someone
who's twat

32:07.259 --> 32:08.992
wasn't blown out
birthing your babies?

32:08.994 --> 32:11.261
Did you find..
What are you looking
for in a woman?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.462
What are you
looking for?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.764
Why don't you start
with that?

32:13.766 --> 32:16.233
We've run our course!

32:16.235 --> 32:17.334
Fucking run our course?

32:17.336 --> 32:19.903
Why the fuck did i
move to California

32:19.905 --> 32:21.872
if I had run my
fucking course with you?

32:21.874 --> 32:22.940
<i> Are you fucking --</i>

32:22.942 --> 32:24.675
<i> I'll take the fall</i>
<i> for this.</i>

32:24.677 --> 32:27.044
<i> You'll take the fall!</i>
<i> God!</i>

32:27.046 --> 32:28.478
Of course,
you'll take the fall.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.549
You have made me crazy!
God!

32:32.551 --> 32:36.286
This is gonna be better
for everyone.

32:37.488 --> 32:38.522
Right, Medina?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.828
<i> Tell your mother,</i>
<i> please.</i>

32:44.830 --> 32:47.965
<i> Tell your mother,</i>
<i> please, Medina.</i>

32:47.967 --> 32:50.100
Right? What?

32:50.102 --> 32:52.602
<i> Right, Medina?</i>
<i> What? You what?</i>

32:55.473 --> 32:56.907
Fuck you.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.312
Do you have something you
wanna say to me, Medina?

33:03.349 --> 33:05.549
- Medina! Medina!
- Hey! Medina!

33:07.719 --> 33:09.653
What are you talking
to Medina for?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.421
What does she know
that I don't know?

33:11.423 --> 33:12.990
I'm your wife,
goddammit.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.059
<i> I had sex with you</i>
<i> for 20 fucking years!</i>

33:16.061 --> 33:19.096
<i> Our fucking</i>
<i> real estate agent?</i>

33:19.098 --> 33:20.630
We came out here
a year ago

33:20.632 --> 33:21.865
and we took her
to lunch.

33:21.867 --> 33:22.933
<i> I know.</i>

33:22.935 --> 33:25.802
You held my hand
under the table.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.604
<i> What, have you been</i>
<i> fucking each other</i>

33:27.606 --> 33:30.340
on text? On Facebook?

33:30.342 --> 33:31.808
Get the fuck
out of my house.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.011
I'm embarrassed
to be your wife.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.279
<i> Get the fuck</i>
<i> out of my house!</i>

34:01.372 --> 34:02.973
<i> Oh, boy.</i>

34:02.975 --> 34:04.641
<i> Oh, man, I..</i>

34:04.643 --> 34:06.710
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> what to say.</i>

34:08.379 --> 34:10.781
I'm so sorry.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.815
I just snapped.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.885
I just snapped
for a sec.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.789
<i> Can we forget</i>
<i> all of this?</i>

34:20.024 --> 34:22.259
<i> Can we please just</i>
<i> forget all of this?</i>

34:22.261 --> 34:24.127
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> why'd we move here</i>
<i> in the first place?</i>

34:24.129 --> 34:26.730
Oh, you're the one
who wanted the money.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.864
And the Mercedes.

34:27.866 --> 34:28.965
If you don't care
about that

34:28.967 --> 34:31.068
let's stop
all this then.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.369
Alright.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.341
<i> Credit cards</i>
<i> are for emergencies only.</i>

34:38.342 --> 34:39.476
Come on, Phil,
there's --

34:39.478 --> 34:40.811
the checks
will come weekly.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.846
There's no reason
to take things this far.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.707
Come home.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.809
You promised
you'd never leave me.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.678
For better or for worse.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.980
That's the deal.
Remember?

35:21.185 --> 35:22.752
Phil, come on.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.422
For the sake
of the kids.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.791
Don't do this to them!

35:27.793 --> 35:29.726
I will get help.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.496
I will. I will.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.432
I love you.
We love each other.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.400
I've tried everything
i could.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.572
I've tried everything
i could.

35:44.675 --> 35:47.244
Nothing's gonna change.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.127
Jimmy.

37:12.797 --> 37:13.964
<i> Yeah?</i>

37:15.499 --> 37:16.766
I can't sleep.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.837
Would you come
sit in my room?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.409
<i> Sure, mom.</i>

37:26.411 --> 37:27.644
<i> Sure.</i>

37:31.649 --> 37:33.683
<i> Now is the time to take</i>
<i> control of your..</i>

37:33.685 --> 37:35.518
<i> Now is the time</i>

37:35.520 --> 37:38.421
to take control
of your life.

37:38.423 --> 37:42.359
Now is the time to take
control of your life.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.362
Let's find dad
and cheer him on, huh?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.696
He loves that.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.900
-<i> Mom?</i>
- Oh, shit.

37:54.538 --> 37:55.538
<i> Mom.</i>

38:02.313 --> 38:03.380
<i> Mom.</i>

38:04.348 --> 38:05.749
Alright, pick it up.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.083
<i> Hey.</i>

38:07.085 --> 38:09.252
I called him softly.
Phil!

38:09.254 --> 38:11.221
- Alright.
- Hey, Phil!

38:11.223 --> 38:12.789
Oh, look at this.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.925
Look at this little
fucking playdate.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.061
I found you. Hi.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.796
<i> Hi. Can I join?</i>

38:20.931 --> 38:22.699
I know you've always
wanted me to join.

38:22.701 --> 38:26.102
So here I am to make
your wish come true.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.137
Kids, go back
to the car, please.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.239
Let's see.

38:29.241 --> 38:31.107
Oh, good,
here's a racket.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.342
Where were we?

38:32.344 --> 38:34.911
Where's the score here
with this little game?

38:34.913 --> 38:36.146
- Ow!
- Love-nothing.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.781
Whoa, hey!
Come on, sand --

38:37.783 --> 38:39.749
- motherfucker!
- Calm down!

38:39.751 --> 38:42.752
Maybe you wanna teach me
because I am a beginner

38:42.754 --> 38:44.087
<i> and you are</i>
<i> quite a teacher.</i>

38:44.089 --> 38:45.789
- Please don't do this --
- you are quite a te..

38:45.791 --> 38:49.893
I would back the fuck up
if I were you, Phil.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.294
Please don't do this.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.129
Let's see, who did
you like to teach?

38:53.131 --> 38:54.631
Lynn g.,
remember that bitch?

38:54.633 --> 38:56.466
- Jesus Christ. Alright.
- Amber, gigi.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.934
Motherfucker!

38:58.936 --> 39:01.738
Oh, Ava,
didn't you know, huh?

39:03.474 --> 39:06.042
You're just another bead
on a long string, honey.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.145
You thought you found
your meal ticket

39:09.147 --> 39:10.313
here with Dr. Phil.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.316
Well, let me guarantee
you something, okay?

39:13.318 --> 39:17.087
All you're gonna end up
with is a mouthful
of jizz.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.099
Come on, kids.
Shut your mouths.

39:29.101 --> 39:31.101
Let's go. Jim!

39:41.245 --> 39:43.246
Hey, look who it is.

39:43.248 --> 39:44.914
Hey, dude.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.516
Picked up some new shit
if you want some?

39:47.785 --> 39:50.787
Yeah, sure.
I'll call you later.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.789
Alright, I'll see you
out there.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.899
Oh, holy shit.
I think that's Dan edder.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.835
<i> Guy's a legend</i>
<i> around here.</i>

40:05.837 --> 40:08.538
<i> I've seen pictures</i>
<i> of him in magazines.</i>

40:08.540 --> 40:10.073
<i> He drives</i>
<i> to, like, Mexico</i>

40:10.075 --> 40:11.941
<i> and Nicaragua</i>
<i> and surfs big breaks.</i>

40:14.846 --> 40:16.246
<i> Oh, man!</i>

40:18.015 --> 40:19.449
<i> Alex says</i>
<i> he never surfs the bay</i>

40:19.451 --> 40:21.418
except on big days.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.819
And that he
doesn't talk.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.522
He's really,
really good.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.498
Keep it cool.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.739
- What's up?
- Hey.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.674
You two gettin'
out there?

40:44.676 --> 40:46.009
Yeah, for sure.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.582
Great bay.
Good for the take-offs.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.156
<i> Hey.</i>

41:00.158 --> 41:02.625
You come back next time
and I'll show you
the secret spot.

41:13.103 --> 41:15.738
Hey. Oh, hi, kids.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.540
- Hey.
- You look nice.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.375
What, you have a new
girlfriend or somethin'?

41:19.377 --> 41:20.577
No.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.446
Where are you going?

41:24.982 --> 41:27.617
Just to a party.
Someone's house.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.619
Apparently,
there's a bowling alley..

41:31.355 --> 41:32.622
...in the house.

41:35.025 --> 41:36.860
Who's gonna be
at this party?

41:38.429 --> 41:39.596
I don't know.

41:41.599 --> 41:44.267
You haven't perfected
your father's signature

41:44.269 --> 41:46.035
<i> and we have a lot</i>
<i> of work to do.</i>

41:46.037 --> 41:47.504
<i> We have checks.</i>

41:47.506 --> 41:48.938
I don't want
you going out

41:48.940 --> 41:51.441
until you have it
perfected.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.610
You -- you're the man
of the house now.

41:54.612 --> 41:55.745
Alright?

42:34.052 --> 42:35.451
Go fish.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.589
- Jimmy.
- Huh?

42:39.591 --> 42:41.057
<i> Go fish, Jimmy.</i>

43:01.012 --> 43:03.613
<i> Super plus!</i>
<i> Hot, hot, hot!</i>

43:03.615 --> 43:06.783
Turn it all on.
Turn it.. Jimmy, go
to the kitchen.

43:06.785 --> 43:08.952
I like it
really nice and cool.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.086
<i> Here.</i>

43:12.723 --> 43:14.057
<i> Oh, wait a minute.</i>

43:14.059 --> 43:16.926
-<i> Here, chandelier.</i>
- Over here. Over here.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.262
Come here, Jimmy.
Oh, that's very good.

43:21.732 --> 43:24.067
Take this, Phil.
Take this, Phil.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.135
What do you think
of that, Phil?

43:31.108 --> 43:32.342
<i> Hm.</i>

43:32.344 --> 43:34.711
Oh, my god. Okay.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.980
Alright, put them down.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.816
Oh, it's like playing
with a.. Alright.

43:41.685 --> 43:44.253
Jim, go fish.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.157
- <i> You sleepy?</i>
<i>- Hm?</i>

43:48.159 --> 43:50.727
<i> Sleepy bunny.</i>
<i> You sleepy..</i>

43:56.634 --> 43:58.701
- Hey.
-<i> What's up?</i>

44:01.405 --> 44:03.406
- You wanna come in?
- Sure.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.647
<i> You hang out</i>
<i> with the gay boys, huh?</i>

44:12.449 --> 44:14.817
Not really, they're my
brother's friends, but..

44:16.720 --> 44:19.789
Pseudo-macho dipshits
if you ask me.

44:27.231 --> 44:29.232
So where's
your favorite place
that you've traveled to?

44:31.001 --> 44:32.335
Mexico's good.

44:38.575 --> 44:40.376
<i> Wash it down with this.</i>

44:40.378 --> 44:41.511
Okay.

44:45.616 --> 44:47.383
- You alright?
- Yeah.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.499
<i> No. Stop.</i>

45:38.135 --> 45:39.635
No, I don't really
wanna do this.

45:39.637 --> 45:41.437
- It's alright.
- No, I don't want to.

45:41.439 --> 45:42.705
Don't be..

45:44.708 --> 45:47.343
No, it's fine. It's fine.
Trust me. Trust me.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.283
Stop. Stop.

46:34.491 --> 46:36.492
Well, hey, hot stuff.

46:36.494 --> 46:39.028
Mm. You looked great
out there.

46:39.030 --> 46:40.596
Thanks. Give me a sec.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.607
Medina?

46:51.609 --> 46:53.276
Yeah. And how do you know
who I am?

46:54.611 --> 46:55.611
I'm Adrian.

46:56.747 --> 46:58.381
I've been living
with your dad.

47:01.451 --> 47:03.486
You shouldn't be here.
My brother's
gonna kill you.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.021
Well, I --
i just wanna talk --

47:05.023 --> 47:06.289
- I don't.
- That's..

47:08.492 --> 47:10.026
Did my dad send you?

47:12.763 --> 47:13.930
No.

47:16.733 --> 47:17.733
Good.

47:19.369 --> 47:20.837
Looks rough out there.

47:23.307 --> 47:26.776
- Do you even surf?
- Yeah, I surf.

47:28.812 --> 47:31.581
Just a little bit
better than that girl
in the white bikini.

47:34.751 --> 47:36.586
Well, you can't surf
at lunada.

47:36.588 --> 47:38.087
Maybe try Pratt point.

47:39.923 --> 47:41.924
They're the worst part
about moving here,
you know.

47:48.332 --> 47:50.266
How do I get to Pratt?

47:50.268 --> 47:51.868
<i> Someone has</i>
<i> to show you.</i>

48:02.880 --> 48:04.313
Oh.

48:55.732 --> 48:56.866
Sandy?

48:59.569 --> 49:01.904
It's Joe. Joe pitchuck.

49:01.906 --> 49:04.240
We met a while ago.

49:04.242 --> 49:07.843
Uh, I work at the,
uh, coldwell banker too.

49:07.845 --> 49:09.679
Oh.

49:09.681 --> 49:11.681
-<i> You okay?</i>
- Oh.

49:13.083 --> 49:14.650
Yeah, I'm -- I'm great.

49:14.652 --> 49:18.888
Everything is
pretty terrific, Joe.

49:18.890 --> 49:20.623
I'm sorry
about the article.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.392
Yeah, well, I can imagine
some pretty dark things

49:23.394 --> 49:25.061
but I didn't think
he would..

49:25.063 --> 49:27.964
...buy a palazzo for her.

49:27.966 --> 49:30.066
Yeah, it was quite a sale.

49:30.068 --> 49:31.867
I know 'cause,
uh, that bitch stole

49:31.869 --> 49:34.470
the, uh, listing right
out from under me.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.072
But listen to me.

49:36.074 --> 49:37.807
You're a really
terrific lady.

49:37.809 --> 49:40.142
And this is no reflection
on you, okay?

49:42.279 --> 49:44.447
Thank you.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.182
Thank you for
saying that.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.351
If there is anything
you need

49:48.353 --> 49:50.252
you know,
just give me a call.

49:50.254 --> 49:51.520
Here's my number.

49:53.690 --> 49:54.924
Gosh, Joe, those are

49:54.926 --> 49:56.625
those are
really kind words.

49:56.627 --> 49:57.760
Thank you.

49:59.596 --> 50:01.163
Nobody reads that stuff.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.333
<i> Check out</i>
<i> these mushrooms, man.</i>

50:04.335 --> 50:05.868
<i> Trust me, you'll never</i>
<i> have as much fun</i>

50:05.870 --> 50:07.636
<i> in astronomy, bro.</i>

50:07.638 --> 50:09.405
- Yeah. Yeah.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

50:09.407 --> 50:10.773
<i> Bro, don't do it.</i>

50:10.775 --> 50:12.274
<i> Bro, don't fucking</i>
<i> throw up.</i>

50:13.778 --> 50:14.910
<i> Alright. Eat it.</i>
<i> Eat it. Eat it.</i>

50:14.912 --> 50:16.178
You're gonna
fucking waste it, bro.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.513
-<i> Eat it.</i>
- No fucking way.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.315
Eat it, bro.
Fucking eat it.

50:19.317 --> 50:20.816
<i> That's $20</i>
<i> in the fucking sink.</i>

50:20.818 --> 50:22.218
<i> Eat it, okay?</i>

50:26.391 --> 50:28.391
Get it all.
You want it all in there.

50:30.794 --> 50:32.261
Gross.

50:54.384 --> 50:55.418
Hey.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.053
I wanna read you
something.

50:58.288 --> 50:59.422
Okay.

51:04.027 --> 51:05.428
A plus?

51:06.496 --> 51:08.230
A plus?

51:08.232 --> 51:10.299
You're a genius, Medina.

51:11.701 --> 51:14.036
A genius.

51:14.038 --> 51:15.638
A plus.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.940
Here, read it to me.
Read it to me.

51:20.510 --> 51:22.812
"The marubo tribe
from Africa believes

51:22.814 --> 51:24.547
that no one in
their tribe can ever
safely leave --"

51:24.549 --> 51:25.815
marubo.

51:27.517 --> 51:28.784
Pay attention.

51:30.654 --> 51:34.390
"Sometimes marubo children
sneak away to cape town

51:34.392 --> 51:36.459
"but the elders
are smart.

51:36.461 --> 51:38.627
They keep everyone's soul
in a jar."

51:38.629 --> 51:41.797
Wow. Soul jar.

51:41.799 --> 51:42.998
That's cool.

51:48.438 --> 51:51.340
"The kids have to come
back for their souls.

51:51.342 --> 51:54.043
"If they don't,
they die soulless.

51:54.045 --> 51:55.845
And a lot of them do."

51:58.315 --> 51:59.715
That's sad.

52:01.284 --> 52:03.452
What they're trying
to say is

52:03.454 --> 52:05.221
nothing's worse
than leaving your tribe.

52:05.223 --> 52:06.555
Not even dying.

52:09.826 --> 52:11.994
Maybe we're the tribe
of palos verdes.

52:13.497 --> 52:14.864
<i> You and me.</i>

52:18.235 --> 52:19.635
You keep my soul..

52:20.770 --> 52:22.371
...and I keep yours.

52:23.607 --> 52:26.976
We stick together,
no matter what.

52:36.386 --> 52:38.120
Kids!

52:38.122 --> 52:39.788
I have an announcement!

52:43.660 --> 52:45.294
We're starting
a new life.

52:48.733 --> 52:51.934
We are going to be
surrounded by beauty.

52:51.936 --> 52:54.003
Our life will be
one of style.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.404
We could get a gazebo!

52:55.406 --> 52:56.872
<i> New set</i>
<i> of pool furniture.</i>

52:56.874 --> 52:58.407
It's indoor-outdoor
living.

52:58.409 --> 52:59.642
That's what it is.

52:59.644 --> 53:01.477
That's why you move
to California

53:01.479 --> 53:02.778
and we're gonna have it!

53:02.780 --> 53:04.079
<i> Would you</i>
<i> like a playhouse?</i>

53:04.081 --> 53:05.447
Like a little house
with everything in it

53:05.449 --> 53:07.316
that's just
the right size?

53:07.318 --> 53:08.884
Phil Mason. Phil Mason.

53:08.886 --> 53:11.787
It's black.
It's black. Phil Mason.

53:11.789 --> 53:13.355
Can someone get me
a telephone, please?

53:13.357 --> 53:14.423
Order.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.861
No.

53:18.863 --> 53:22.031
Hello, yes. From the
palisades collection.

53:24.100 --> 53:26.769
<i> King size sleigh bed</i>
<i> with a beachy feel.</i>

53:26.771 --> 53:29.738
Yes, with the mattress.
Organic.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.873
Yes.

53:37.681 --> 53:39.215
You have a 5?

53:39.217 --> 53:41.517
Oh, look who's all
dressed up for daddy.

53:41.519 --> 53:43.986
I'm not dressed up.
Jim, are you ready?

53:48.758 --> 53:50.259
It's just dinner.

53:54.264 --> 53:56.398
You think your dad's
gonna bring his new son?

54:01.805 --> 54:03.839
Dad really wants
to see you.

54:06.343 --> 54:07.943
No, I'm over it.

54:16.786 --> 54:19.321
Oh, thank you.
Look at that.

54:21.424 --> 54:22.658
That's a whole fish
right there, huh?

54:22.660 --> 54:24.059
That's the whole fish.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.663
Do you know
that human beings
are the only species

54:27.665 --> 54:30.466
that befriend their prey
before they eat them?

54:30.468 --> 54:32.268
Oh, god.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.003
- Here we go.
- Hm.

54:34.005 --> 54:35.604
We're also
the only species

54:35.606 --> 54:40.442
that flies airplanes
and transplant hearts.

54:40.444 --> 54:43.846
You know, when you eat
vegetables, you kill them.

54:45.315 --> 54:48.284
I don't think
that's, uh, correct, mom.

54:48.286 --> 54:51.553
Adrian goes to westridge,
the brainbox school.

54:51.555 --> 54:53.355
He's gonna study
animal sciences

54:53.357 --> 54:55.758
in the fall
if he aces his finals.

54:55.760 --> 54:58.294
- So, Phil.
- Hm?

54:58.296 --> 55:00.929
The guys only allow
white people in this club?

55:03.034 --> 55:04.466
- No, no, no, no.
-<i> Oh, my god.</i>

55:04.468 --> 55:06.001
What?

55:06.003 --> 55:07.169
No.

55:07.171 --> 55:09.305
There's Jerry.

55:09.307 --> 55:11.140
- There's the wongs.
-<i> Okay, well..</i>

55:12.543 --> 55:14.376
Medina, what about you?

55:14.378 --> 55:16.612
What are you
interested in?

55:17.914 --> 55:19.748
- Surfing.
- Yeah?

55:19.750 --> 55:21.383
Really like
surfing a lot.

55:21.385 --> 55:24.353
You like surfing?
That's great.

55:24.355 --> 55:26.588
<i> I surfed once.</i>

55:26.590 --> 55:27.956
<i> I was pretty good,</i>
<i> but then I got, like</i>

55:27.958 --> 55:29.758
<i> 4 stitches</i>
<i> on my chin, so..</i>

55:37.200 --> 55:39.601
Well, we got
through that.

55:41.905 --> 55:43.439
Thank you for coming.

55:43.441 --> 55:45.240
He's a strange one, huh?

55:47.078 --> 55:48.977
Yeah, he is.

55:48.979 --> 55:50.979
Hey, I need you to, uh

55:50.981 --> 55:53.082
talk to your mother
about something for me.

55:53.084 --> 55:56.318
I have to go to Paris
for a medical conference.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.854
Ava's never seen
the riviera.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.155
Um..

56:01.458 --> 56:03.659
...can you tell her
you're okay with that?

56:03.661 --> 56:05.561
You are, right?

56:07.263 --> 56:09.064
Yeah,
i could talk to her.

56:11.334 --> 56:13.936
Thanks. I appreciate it.

56:13.938 --> 56:16.372
- Yup. I'll see you soon.
- Okay, sweetie.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.420
He didn't even
say goodbye.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.758
He doesn't leave
for a week.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.426
You should call him.

56:39.462 --> 56:40.763
Really?

56:45.435 --> 56:46.802
I don't know.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.539
I keep trying to laugh
with the boys.

56:52.809 --> 56:55.577
Everything I say
sounds weird and wrong.

56:57.480 --> 56:59.748
Like someone's talking
through my mouth.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.754
Do you ever
feel that way?

57:09.759 --> 57:10.959
Yeah.

57:13.329 --> 57:14.797
Sometimes, I guess.

57:20.069 --> 57:22.271
Can I ask you
a question?

57:24.841 --> 57:25.941
Yeah.

57:27.811 --> 57:29.912
Do you love surfing?

57:32.749 --> 57:34.616
<i> Yeah.</i>

57:34.618 --> 57:36.718
<i> I mean, really love it?</i>

57:39.088 --> 57:40.422
<i> Yeah, I do.</i>

57:42.826 --> 57:44.026
I don't.

57:48.665 --> 57:51.533
<i> Of course, you do.</i>
<i> You're so good at it.</i>

57:59.609 --> 58:01.743
I shouldn't have hit dad
that time.

58:06.583 --> 58:08.584
He hates me now.

58:10.854 --> 58:12.955
<i> No, he doesn't, Jim.</i>

58:41.050 --> 58:42.317
Nice spot.

58:55.698 --> 58:58.333
You know what?
Let's go somewhere else.

58:58.335 --> 59:00.068
I can show
you something.

59:07.944 --> 59:09.845
So what are they doing?

59:09.847 --> 59:12.014
They're putting them back
into the wild.

59:12.016 --> 59:13.482
They take
malnourished pups

59:13.484 --> 59:16.451
and feed them back
to health for 3 months

59:16.453 --> 59:19.054
and then off they go.

59:22.125 --> 59:23.659
Oh, my gosh.

59:28.865 --> 59:30.399
They're so cute.

59:32.535 --> 59:33.869
<i> Wow.</i>

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.119
So what are you,
an animal freak?

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.187
Yup.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.557
I'm gonna be
a wildlife vet.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.293
That's pretty cool.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.832
I think this thing
with your dad and my mom

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.367
it sucks.

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:41.903
And I'm sorry.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.912
Do you think my dad's
gonna come back

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.914
or are they
actually in love?

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.518
Who knows?

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:32.154
- I hate the towel girls.
- Mm.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.722
- They wear all match --
- all the matching towels.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:36.024
Watch
the popular guys surf.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.793
I hate everyone
in palos verdes.

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.364
Seriously, you're the only
cool person I met here.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.279
You can't tell anyone
that we're friends.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.414
Okay?

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.751
I won't tell anyone
we're friends.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.292
And I hate people

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.728
who don't share
their food.

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.097
Well, I usually hate
people who eat my food.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.236
I really like
you though.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.981
I'm still
chewing my chip.

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:55.570
<i> It's taking a little</i>
<i> while, but he'll feel</i>

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.405
much better after he gets
a little bit rested

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:59.374
I promise. Um --

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:01.276
this is
my teenage daughter.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.178
- She's all hysterics.
- Mom!

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.446
- Okay.
- What happened? Is he --

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.882
he's fine, Medina.
He's fine.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:09.451
- Is he in here?
- Yes, but shh.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.353
Uh, Mrs. Mason, if I may
ask you a few questions.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.420
Okay.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.556
Has your son been
using, uh, alcohol

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:15.757
or drugs lately?

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.192
Absolutely not.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.660
He's just under
a lot of stress.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.562
His father ran off
with a skank.

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:22.531
We're running
out of money, uh..

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.967
Have you considered
anxiety medication?

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:29.938
Oh, I have a prescription.
Thank you.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.374
I'm sorry.
I meant for your son.

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.048
Are you okay?

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:42.951
Yeah.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.221
<i> But you scared me..</i>

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.825
...so much.

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.233
Please stop, Jim.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.471
I'm really glad
you're here.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.345
<i> Hey.</i>

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.015
Wow.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.685
- You came.
- Come on. Come on.

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:18.386
Jesus Christ.

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:22.924
How are you feeling?

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.862
Come on.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.632
I know that,
uh, it's hard

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:31.967
when everyone else
is doing it.

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:33.835
<i> Just don't, right?</i>

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:35.971
You're smarter
than that.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:37.105
Yeah.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.175
Just -- just stupid.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.845
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.214
Good.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.817
Hey, dad, can we come
to Paris with you guys?

01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:51.319
Oh, my god.
I would so love that.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.555
Yeah?

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.958
Um, this trip
is not for fun.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.127
You know, it's a --
it's a medical conference.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.363
But next time,
definitely yes.

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:04.132
Yes.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.236
Besides I don't think
your mother would be

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.238
too thrilled, right?

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:14.943
How's it going over there?
She doing okay?

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.378
Sure.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.246
You would not
believe the bills
that I'm getting.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.415
Does she ever
turn the lights off?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.050
I hope she's not off
her meds.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.920
She's not crazy, dad.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.555
She's just sad.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.525
Yeah, I know.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.562
Well, I'm gonna call
and check on you guys

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.665
every week.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.200
And when I get home

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:41.269
<i> we'll figure things out,</i>
<i> alright?</i>

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.178
Dad, I really
don't think

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.113
it's a good idea
that you go.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.183
Okay.

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.152
This is a work trip.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:59.087
I have to be there,
alright?

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.089
I'm gonna set
a good example for Jim.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:03.425
Someone has to be
an adult around here.

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:05.593
Everybody doesn't
get to go bonkers.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.039
Hi, Mrs. Mason.

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:53.575
Don't be long, son.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.013
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm here.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:59.280
I -- I hope
it's not weird.

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:00.548
I just didn't hear
from you last night.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.951
<i> We were supposed</i>
<i> to go out, so worried.</i>

01:07:02.953 --> 01:07:04.486
Oh, no, it's..

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.590
We just had..
Mom's really sick.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.425
Had to take her
to the emergency, so..

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:11.760
Oh, okay.

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:13.728
God, she gets
sick a lot.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.332
Yeah.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.601
It's been a really
long night. I should..

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:21.903
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay, um..

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.106
- Get some rest.
- Alright.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:34.349
<i> A lot of terrible things</i>
<i> could happen, you know?</i>

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:35.517
<i> You could</i>
<i> get her pregnant.</i>

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:37.252
<i> She could force you</i>
<i> to marry her.</i>

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:40.055
I'm not getting
married, mom.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:42.090
<i> I'm too young.</i>

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.359
Well, that's my point.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.528
I don't even like her
that much.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.798
Well..

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.934
...then there's no point
in spending so much time

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:54.502
with her, is there?

01:07:56.839 --> 01:08:00.542
Honey, I'm just
going through

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:03.645
a rough patch, okay?

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:07.415
<i> When you're with me,</i>
<i> it helps me so much</i>

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.151
'cause you're the man
of the house.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:13.788
And you're more of a man
than your father ever was.

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.358
So, hey.

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:22.162
No more trips
to the hospital, alright?

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.898
That's not fun.

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:29.604
Baby, it's just till
i get my feet under me.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.939
I promise.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:37.278
I'm just trying to look
after the two of you.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.020
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:51.192
I heard
what happened to Jim.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:52.359
You okay?

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:59.167
I'm not sure anyone
in the family's okay.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.237
I'm sorry,
i -- I -- I wish

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.272
I could come over there
right now.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.910
Yeah, that'd be nice.

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.148
So, um..

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.719
...when you going off to
that veterinarian school?

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:21.356
<i> Um, it's a real school,</i>
<i> yes.</i>

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.459
Do they have,
like, fraternities?

01:09:24.461 --> 01:09:26.261
You're gonna
join a frat?

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.363
<i> Well, yeah, of course,</i>
<i> oh, you know</i>

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:31.765
I'll be
an oma ki kappa sig bro.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:35.803
I like picturing that.

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:46.180
Did you hear
Johnny fucked Kelly Bob?

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:47.314
-<i> No!</i>
- No way.

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:48.616
I swear to god.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.421
- What are these guys?
- Yo, you can't surf here.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.757
-<i> Hey, babe, just relax.</i>
- Yo.

01:09:58.061 --> 01:10:00.028
Fuck's with this guy?

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.063
Hey, you're not
fucking listening to me?

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.198
You can't fucking
surf here.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.866
Dude, you don't own
this fucking beach.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.468
- Fucking told you!
- Get off! Get off!

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.304
- What are you doing?
- Come on, get off!

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:11.039
-<i> Get off me.</i>
- Fuck off.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.289
Wow.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.927
<i> This is weird.</i>

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.831
Does he hide millions
under the mattress?

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:38.933
No.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.771
They hide it in a fake
cantaloupe in the fridge.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.026
You like it?

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.395
Yeah.

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.118
It was nice last night.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:12.653
Yeah, it was.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.791
I hope you don't get
in trouble though

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.526
because of me.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.027
No, I'm gonna be fine.

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.530
I have my window, so..

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:23.831
- Jesus!
- Get out of the car.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.466
Wait, no. No, don't
get out. Don't get out.

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:26.901
Medina. Medina. No.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.770
- Fuck you, asshole!
-<i> Stop it!</i>

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:29.971
Get the fuck
out of the car!

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:32.006
- Jim, stop!
- Medina.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.608
Hey, you already
got my dad!

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.109
- Get back in the car.
- Isn't that enough?

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:36.511
- I don't think I --
- just go!

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:38.846
- You stay the fuck --
- stop! Stop!

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:41.883
- I promise you, okay?
- You're okay?

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:43.818
I can handle this.
Please just go. Okay?

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:47.488
Jim.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.890
Jim. Jim.

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.830
I thought you ran away
for good, man.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.167
Jim.

01:13:59.169 --> 01:14:00.668
- Jim, stop.
- Please don't leave me.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.937
- Look how I am.
- Jim.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.339
I'm right here, okay?
Okay?

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.376
Okay?

01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:10.077
You're all
I've got, Jim.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.713
You're all I've got.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.885
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.758
Well, you gonna
come with me?

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:28.162
Are you gonna keep
acting all crazy?

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.533
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.
- Come in.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:36.170
- Come in.
- Yeah.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:39.307
Come on, Jim.
You're good, okay?

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:41.609
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:44.645
<i> Otherwise leave a message</i>
<i> at the tone.</i>

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.881
Hey, dad, uh..

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.585
...I've been trying
to call you.

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.989
Maybe your phone
doesn't work there.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.157
Um..

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.560
...i don't know.
I'm worried about Jim.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:01.996
It's -- it's --
it's urgent, dad.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.931
What's so urgent?

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.705
I hope your father
isn't teaching you
to lie like him.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.041
I'm worried about Jim.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.978
I'm worried
about him, mom.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.948
I'm -- I'm taking care
of Jim.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.484
You don't need
to worry about Jim.

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:24.519
What?

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:27.021
You're not taking care
of him, mom!

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.956
Okay, he's right in front
of your fucking face

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:29.991
and he's not okay!

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.692
Why are you talking
to me like this?

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.661
I am his mother!

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.196
And you're out
all night, anyway!

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.698
What do you know?
Are you a slut?

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.934
I hear your computer
ringing at 2:00
in the morning.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:41.435
- What kind of person --
-<i> hey, hey.</i>

01:15:41.437 --> 01:15:42.904
An amazing person.

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:44.839
- A great person.
- Cut it out!

01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:47.475
Tell your sister
to stop fighting me!

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:48.709
Jim, come on.
Let's go surf.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:49.977
No, no, no,
it's Saturday.

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:52.413
Jimmy, it's our day.
We have so much to do.

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:54.749
Jim, she treats you
like you're her husband

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:56.083
even though you're not!

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.885
How dare you?

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.620
I do not!

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:02.056
Take it back,
young lady!

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:51.138
- Jim.
- Hmm.

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.975
Jim, wake up.

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:58.412
Let's go surf.

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:06.988
Be careful with that.
It's brand-new.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.923
It's brand-new.
Right in.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.560
Oh, great.

01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:13.594
There should be
big things.

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:14.962
There should be a couple
of headboards

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.931
and a couple
of big rugs.

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:18.432
You know what?
This couch can go.

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:19.934
<i> Just give it away.</i>

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:22.503
Ralph Lauren.
From neiman Marcus. Just..

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.407
I'm live here
in the exclusive

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.576
gated community
of palos verdes.

01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:29.977
<i> Yet another firebreak</i>

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.879
<i> and this one</i>
<i> in crystal cove.</i>

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.248
<i> A resident reported</i>
<i> seeing a man</i>

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.585
<i> described as tall,</i>
<i> possibly latino and fast.</i>

01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:39.920
<i> And we've been able</i>
<i> to track down</i>
<i> that resident..</i>

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.257
Medina!

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.965
What did you do?

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.401
Have a seat.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:58.673
I got you a gift.

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.209
Ta-da!

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.414
Oh, thank you.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.450
It was Jim's idea.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:12.653
1, 2.

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.697
We can be a
family again.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.105
Oh.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.819
By the way,
the house now..

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:46.821
...it's a thing
of beauty.

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:48.122
- You like it?
- You're an artist.

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:50.925
Oh, thank you.
You're too sweet.

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:52.426
The tide's turning.

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.597
My sentiments exactly.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.369
<i> Hm.</i>

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:06.240
I had 3 offers withdrawn
all because of these fires

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.110
and -- and it's killing
my business. It's crazy.

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:10.678
<i> Well, you know what</i>
<i> it is? It's a plague</i>

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.880
on the people
of palos verdes

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:15.816
for their greed,
for their trade

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:17.318
and for the younger model
philosophy.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.520
I mean, what goes around
comes around.

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:20.688
Someone should take
a match

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.590
and burn
the whole place down.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.192
<i> More what?</i>

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:26.961
Potatoes? Salad?

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.029
Mm, that wouldn't be
very good

01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:30.898
for my business now,
would it?

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:35.302
Well, you're the one
who said it.

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.338
Joe pitchuck,
dedicated to raising

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.373
the values
of the community.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:42.576
Well, I said
dedicated to, uh, raising

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:44.745
the property values
of the community.

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:47.014
I -- I -- I don't think
the people are so bad.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:49.183
I mean..

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:51.218
...they're my friends,
Sandy.

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.328
Well, I guess now wouldn't
be the best time

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.564
to put the house
on the market, huh, kids?

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:04.665
<i> Shoot.</i>

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.068
Hold on there a sec.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.372
This is one special
property, you know?

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:13.274
We could have..

01:20:13.276 --> 01:20:15.843
...this house listed in,
like, tomorrow.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.648
You didn't ask me
where I'm going.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.053
I thought I knew.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.423
Okay, Sandy.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.559
Let's please
not talk about it.

01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:33.394
Oh, Jim, I think..

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:36.797
I think maybe you should
escort Mr. pitchuck out.

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.299
What?

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:41.235
Um..

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:42.837
It's okay. Ahem.

01:20:49.946 --> 01:20:51.245
Mom?

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.015
Your mother, the optimist.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.951
Oh, I'm so dumb.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:01.922
It's okay, mom.

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:03.490
<i> I'm live here</i>
<i> in the exclusive</i>

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:05.559
<i> gated community</i>
<i> of palos verdes</i>

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:07.728
<i> with Kristen Dalton,</i>
<i> a homeowner out here.</i>

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.730
And Kristen,
your thoughts?

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:11.999
Our house is way nicer
than hers now.

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:15.236
Maybe we'll get lucky
and the arsonist

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:16.704
will burn down
your father's house.

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:18.038
<i> We don't have</i>
<i> crime here.</i>

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.307
<i> We haven't even had</i>
<i> a crime since 1916.</i>

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:23.077
<i> I mean, I left encino</i>
<i> to get away</i>
<i> from this kind of shit.</i>

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.945
<i> Okay, alright, well,</i>
<i> thanks for talking to us.</i>

01:21:24.947 --> 01:21:27.948
<i> And now I'm getting</i>
<i> reports of another fire.</i>

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.503
Look at it go.

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.441
What if it comes here?

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.279
We'll jump in the ocean.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.496
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:22:15.498 --> 01:22:17.498
I couldn't reach you.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.400
- I told you not to --
-<i> Medina!</i>

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:21.635
<i> I have something</i>
<i> to show you.</i>

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.212
You okay?

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.150
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:37.484
What's going on?

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:43.557
Wanna get out of here?

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:45.492
On that beach.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.661
Surf.

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:49.863
- Just get away.
- I can't do this.

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:55.202
Why? Why, why not?

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.206
I have to be there
for Jim.

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.579
You know, we don't --
we don't have much time.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.852
I know.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.792
You're leaving
and he's staying.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.699
I have to go.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.875
<i> I just spoke</i>
<i> to your father.</i>

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.844
This isn't working.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.414
Um..

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.250
He's decided..

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.586
Medina, you're gonna
go stay with him

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:20.921
for a while.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.691
Jim, you'll stay here.

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:29.129
And that's how
we'll move forward.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.907
I knew it.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.810
Jim, she's lying to you.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.147
Dad would never
say that.

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.651
I'm gonna call him.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.898
<i> You've reached</i>
<i> Dr. Phil Mason.</i>

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.366
<i> If this is</i>
<i> a life-threatening</i>

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:08.735
<i> emergency,</i>
<i> hang up and call 911.</i>

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:11.171
<i> Otherwise leave a message</i>
<i> at the tone.</i>

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.319
Jim.

01:26:01.523 --> 01:26:02.990
Let's get out of here.

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.565
Please just
let me sleep.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.335
I really mean it, Jim.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.740
We're gonna get in the car
and we're gonna drive.

01:26:19.742 --> 01:26:21.575
We're gonna get
the hell away from here.

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:26.480
We can go
to all the places
we talked about.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.688
<i> You're my tribe, Jim.</i>

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.893
It's just you and me.
Okay?

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:44.698
Okay.

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.502
You're right, Medina.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.564
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.573
<i> Here.</i>

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.083
I wish it didn't
have to be like this.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.186
I know.

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.290
I wish
we could celebrate..

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:45.926
...in some way.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.929
Celebrate what?

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:51.131
We're both getting away
from this place.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.435
Yeah, we are.

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:14.655
Thank you.

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.057
Good luck.

01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:34.441
Hey.

01:28:34.443 --> 01:28:35.809
Sorry I'm late.

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:38.378
You excited?

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.114
I feel so great.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.418
<i> Why are you looking</i>
<i> at me like that?</i>

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.486
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:47.621
Stop.

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.357
Okay.

01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:54.494
Hey, I've got something
to show you.

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.697
- I got something --
- Jim, stop.

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:58.765
Come grab your bag.

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:00.434
- Come on!
- Okay.

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.136
Come on.

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:10.777
Come on.

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.984
Storm's moving in.

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:20.887
It's a sign.

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:22.389
Come on, Jim,
we gotta go.

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:25.659
Medina.

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.563
I'm sorry
if I fucked things up.

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.966
I didn't mean to.

01:29:32.968 --> 01:29:35.135
It's okay, Jim,
but we gotta go, okay?

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:39.539
She said someone should
burn the place down.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:46.046
Jim, remember
what we talked about.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.047
We're gonna get
the hell out of here.

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.382
You don't need
to do that!

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.585
I know what I'm doing.

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.489
I love you, Medina.

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:00.260
No, Jim. Mom!

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.505
It's over.

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:14.508
It's really over.

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.917
<i> The fire department</i>
<i> found Jim</i>

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:26.787
<i> incoherent</i>
<i> on Pratt point acid.</i>

01:30:26.789 --> 01:30:28.588
<i> They were pleased</i>
<i> to be able to announce</i>

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.724
<i> that the pv arsonist</i>
<i> had been caught</i>

01:30:30.726 --> 01:30:32.793
<i> and that law and order</i>
<i> would once again</i>

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:34.961
<i> return to peaceful</i>
<i> palos verdes.</i>

01:30:34.963 --> 01:30:36.496
Did you ever see him
start a fire?

01:30:36.498 --> 01:30:38.432
<i> When we found your son,</i>
<i> he was wandering</i>

01:30:38.434 --> 01:30:41.435
<i> disoriented</i>
<i> talking to himself.</i>

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:44.004
<i> He didn't know</i>
<i> where he was</i>

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:46.206
<i> and wasn't able</i>
<i> to answer any questions.</i>

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.075
<i> We found Vicodin</i>
<i> and cocaine</i>

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:51.545
in his possession.

01:30:51.547 --> 01:30:53.847
He appears to have had
a substance-induced

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:55.715
psychotic episode
or break.

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.820
Young brains
are more susceptible.

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:03.623
Especially to
environmental stressors.

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.165
<i> How long -- how long</i>
<i> do you want</i>
<i> to keep him here?</i>

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.269
<i> We're gonna need</i>
<i> to keep him here</i>
<i> for a while.</i>

01:31:16.271 --> 01:31:19.506
I think everyone's gonna
need an adjustment period.

01:31:19.508 --> 01:31:20.740
Okay.

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.628
I got you something.

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.082
How are you doing?

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:12.392
They found the arsonist.

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:15.896
It was a tennis dad.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.700
How crazy is that?

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.575
I'm sorry that I thought
it was you.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:34.948
You scared me.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:37.017
I didn't know what
you were thinking anymore.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:43.456
I feel
very peaceful now.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.468
I'm gonna leave
this place soon.

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.805
We're gonna get you
out of this place.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.410
We're gonna
go on a trip.

01:33:03.412 --> 01:33:06.379
Somewhere where
we're surfing every day.

01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:08.281
And we're gonna be
in warm water.

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.217
<i> We're gonna go</i>
<i> to all the places</i>

01:33:11.219 --> 01:33:12.852
<i> that we talked about.</i>

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:19.225
I'm gonna miss
those big winter waves.

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:27.067
I love you so much,
weirdo.

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:36.109
Oh.

01:33:42.483 --> 01:33:43.984
I love you so much.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.187
Hm.

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:06.139
<i> Property sells fast</i>
<i> in pv.</i>

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:07.941
<i> People like that</i>
<i> the grass must be green</i>

01:34:07.943 --> 01:34:09.909
<i> and cut attractively.</i>

01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:12.612
<i> That all the roofs</i>
<i> must be made of red tile</i>

01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:13.880
<i> and the walls</i>
<i> of each house</i>

01:34:13.882 --> 01:34:15.649
<i> must be painted</i>
<i> every 3 years.</i>

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:20.887
<i> The pv beaches</i>
<i> were maintained daily.</i>

01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:22.756
<i> The city used</i>
<i> special machines</i>

01:34:22.758 --> 01:34:24.724
<i> to clean the sand</i>
<i> that thresh, mix</i>

01:34:24.726 --> 01:34:25.959
<i> and spit out</i>
<i> the crystals</i>

01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:28.962
<i> into immaculate,</i>
<i> fine white powder.</i>

01:34:28.964 --> 01:34:31.765
<i> It was one of these</i>
<i> machines that found Jim</i>

01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:34.034
<i> lying face down</i>
<i> at cabrillo beach</i>

01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:36.670
<i> 15 miles south</i>
<i> of the pv peninsula.</i>

01:34:44.946 --> 01:34:47.047
<i> He overdosed</i>
<i> on a bad mixture</i>

01:34:47.049 --> 01:34:49.783
<i> of prescription drugs</i>
<i> he had stolen.</i>

01:34:49.785 --> 01:34:51.985
<i> His heart</i>
<i> just stopped beating.</i>

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:26.746
<i> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:28.114
I'm sorry.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:32.552
I'm sorry.

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:01.014
<i> There were only 2 days</i>
<i> in my entire life</i>

01:37:01.016 --> 01:37:04.217
<i> that I didn't see Jim.</i>

01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:06.219
<i> I couldn't imagine</i>
<i> a life without him.</i>

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:14.027
<i> My father wants me</i>
<i> to move in with him.</i>

01:37:14.029 --> 01:37:16.462
<i> He says I deserve</i>
<i> every advantage.</i>

01:37:16.464 --> 01:37:18.665
<i> He hopes</i>
<i> I can teach him to surf.</i>

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:22.869
<i> My mother calls</i>
<i> from Joshua tree.</i>

01:37:22.871 --> 01:37:25.004
<i> She says</i>
<i> she's getting help now.</i>

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.739
<i> That we can start</i>
<i> a whole new life</i>

01:37:26.741 --> 01:37:29.075
<i> and that my new room</i>
<i> is ready whenever I am.</i>

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.478
<i> I'm leaving pv..</i>

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.782
<i> ...alone.</i>

01:37:35.784 --> 01:37:37.083
<i> I'm going to surf</i>
<i> the world</i>

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.786
<i> just like Jim and I</i>
<i> had talked about.</i>

01:37:39.788 --> 01:37:43.056
<i> Hawaii, Bali,</i>
<i> java and Mexico.</i>

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:46.292
<i> I have no itinerary.</i>

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:48.461
<i> No plans to return.</i>

01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:51.030
<i> Maybe my tribe</i>
<i> is out there somewhere.</i>

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.068
<i> The ocean</i>
<i> is where I belong.</i>

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.671
<i> I say goodbye to Jim</i>
<i> one last time</i>

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:00.773
<i> from the bay.</i>

01:38:00.775 --> 01:38:03.643
<i> I know that Jim will be</i>
<i> watching me wherever I go</i>

01:38:03.645 --> 01:38:06.012
<i> with a huge smile</i>
<i> on his face.</i>

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:15.855
<i> There's a lot for you</i>
<i> to watch out for</i>

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:17.357
<i> in the ocean.</i>

01:38:17.359 --> 01:38:19.993
<i> Sharks, rays,</i>
<i> riptides, jellyfish</i>

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:21.961
<i> and unpredictable</i>
<i> currents.</i>

01:38:21.963 --> 01:38:24.464
<i> But here's some remedies</i>
<i> for its dangers.</i>

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:27.367
<i> When you get stung</i>
<i> by a jellyfish</i>

01:38:27.369 --> 01:38:29.602
<i> pee immediately</i>
<i> on the sting.</i>

01:38:29.604 --> 01:38:31.938
<i> Uric acid</i>
<i> will soothe the pain.</i>

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:35.575
<i> Duct tape can pretty much</i>
<i> fix everything.</i>

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:38.578
<i> A ripped wetsuit,</i>
<i> a dinged board.</i>

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.613
<i> And if you get swept</i>
<i> into a riptide</i>

01:38:40.615 --> 01:38:42.382
<i> try to remain calm</i>

01:38:42.384 --> 01:38:44.384
<i> then swim like hell</i>
<i> with the horizon.</i>

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:51.491
<i> Other than that,</i>
<i> it's pure magic.</i>

01:38:52.305 --> 01:38:58.326
