00:41.440 --> 00:44.683
I don't remember much about my father,
Jebediah Seagrave.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.205
I don't care to neither.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.081
I remember his horse, Abraham,

00:58.760 --> 01:00.569
with those coal black eyes.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.207
I do remember my mother's face,

01:06.960 --> 01:08.689
watching him as he rode off.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.607
Hard to say as to say
what actually happened up there

01:15.760 --> 01:17.171
in those mining camps.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.251
The story goes;
He and his men came up empty

01:27.600 --> 01:28.931
turned on each other.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.927
People said it was my father
who clone the killing.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.122
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.241
Come on.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.721
One thing, Wyatt.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.330
I intend to bring Father back.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.330
I'm going to stand the son
of a bitch in front of Mother,

03:52.440 --> 03:54.520
have him look her in the eye
and explain why he left.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.764
I can't do that if he's dead.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.646
He ain't the type of man
to be stood up in front of nobody.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.400
I want Mother to hear it.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.961
If Jesus himself
came down off the cross

04:07.080 --> 04:08.605
and told her the truth,
she wouldn't hear it.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.960
<i>Jesus'?</i>

04:10.080 --> 04:10.967
What do you know about Jesus?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.047
Oh, I know plenty.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.601
I got to try.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.565
He's a murderer, Samuel!

04:21.640 --> 04:22.721
Yeah, well who ain't?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.131
You wouldn't know nothing about it.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.208
Promise me
we're going to bring him back alive.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.000
You got my word.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.246
What can we do you for, Sheriff?

05:43.960 --> 05:47.601
A man in Mr. Hall's employ
was killed last night.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.926
Up in the high country north of here.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.042
Got his throat cut
and his gold stolen from him.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.043
Did you figure out
who it was that did this?

06:04.280 --> 06:05.930
She saw the whole thing.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.726
Now she described the assassin.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.367
I was reminded of you, Wyatt.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.211
I wasn't anywhere near there.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.567
I'll take a gander in your saddlebags

06:37.680 --> 06:40.001
if you've no objection.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.764
Well...

06:54.000 --> 06:58.164
I wonder if you might have
hid the treasure in your house,

06:58.280 --> 06:59.725
- or your-
- I'll tell you what,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.684
you set one foot on my property
and I'll shoot you myself.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.808
You rest assured, sir,

07:11.400 --> 07:14.324
I'll be keeping close tabs on you...

07:15.960 --> 07:17.485
and yours.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.805
Jesus, Wyatt. Nothing's been drawn.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.850
He can kiss my ass.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.123
That old coot's got a gun and a badge,
and a bug up his ass over you.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.447
Oh, he just likes to
give himself talk, is all.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.842
Where did you disappear
to last night, anyway?

07:39.160 --> 07:41.481
Felt the need to dip my wick
and have a coke,

07:41.600 --> 07:43.443
not that it's any
of your fucking business.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.210
Right on time.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.243
Allow me to introduce
Colonel Rupert Thomas,

08:10.560 --> 08:13.006
a veteran of the Indian wars,

08:13.120 --> 08:16.488
instrumental in the campaigns
against Red Cloud and the Sioux.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.886
The Colonel will be accompanying
you both as guide,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.128
and as a representative of the bank.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.561
That wasn't part of our agreement.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.847
As the Colonel is familiar
with the territory,

08:29.960 --> 08:32.884
I think you'll find
him a very valuable asset.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.361
Asset or not, we had a deal.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.971
I'm afraid the matter
is not open to discussion.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.881
I'm counting on your expertise, Colonel.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.490
I foresee none
but the usual travails, Mr. Howell.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.321
What do you think?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.442
I'll tell you what.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.366
If ol' Rupert over there
even looks at me crossways,

09:13.480 --> 09:14.601
I'm gonna gut him like a pig

09:14.640 --> 09:16.404
and ditch his carcass
in the nearest crick.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.441
Hey, Rupert!

09:21.240 --> 09:22.366
You coming?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.081
One thing.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.445
A man to Halston came back.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.007
You know his name?

09:43.120 --> 09:46.567
Hawkins. Percival Hawkins.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.528
Well, I'm going to need to talk to him.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.880
You know where we can find him?

09:51.840 --> 09:52.807
Indeed I do.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.721
Whoa.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.361
This is it.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.000
Anybody in there?

11:02.160 --> 11:03.082
Hey!

11:04.600 --> 11:05.408
What?

11:05.920 --> 11:09.049
Hey can we, ah,
speak to you for a second, please?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.005
Hey, slow down there.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.041
Hey, we ain't trying to hurt you,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.809
just trying to ask
a couple of questions.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.928
Hey, can you... can you hear me?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.366
Show him the picture.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.807
You know this man?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.048
I make that to be
an affirmative response.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.330
Come here. Let me see.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.084
Here, let me see it.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.362
- Jesus.
- It was hands, Jesus.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.442
- Hands.
- It's his tongue, right?

12:02.560 --> 12:03.686
It's ripped out.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.366
It's no ordinary type of evil would turn

12:10.480 --> 12:12.562
a mountain of a man
like him into mush.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.281
Did you ever doubt
it was done to shut him up?

12:17.600 --> 12:18.442
Hey, look.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.530
Well, if that was the goal,

12:24.360 --> 12:26.362
either by Jebediah's hand or another,

12:27.760 --> 12:29.649
I call this a grand success.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.081
It's a shame.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.770
He's a good-looking bastard.

12:43.000 --> 12:43.728
You knew he was mute.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.444
Why the hell
didn't you say something?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.962
Man lost his boy a few weeks back.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.490
I was leading another expedition.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.771
We ran out of supplies.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.925
Forced to turn back,
we ran across him in the timber.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.007
Panicked.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.569
Tried to warn the poor bastard.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.846
Come on!

13:55.320 --> 13:56.765
The eggs are frozen.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.520
Morning, Lisa.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.051
Looks like the boys
left you a little shy on wood.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.365
I can chop some if need be.
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.250
I wanted to ask you
a couple 'a questions...

14:52.360 --> 14:53.361
About...?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.370
Your brother-in-law.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.201
My dear.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.042
What's he done?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.809
You expecting company?

15:31.320 --> 15:33.243
What can I do for you boys?

15:33.760 --> 15:35.524
We're here to survey the property.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.451
For what purpose,
and on whose authority?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.921
Mr. George Howell
of the Dawson City Bank.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.210
They're foreclosing on the 28th...?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.200
Get the gun.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.246
God damn it! Get the horses!
Samuel, get the horses!

16:40.440 --> 16:41.407
Go!

16:42.520 --> 16:44.284
God damn it!

16:47.160 --> 16:48.366
God damn it!

16:49.240 --> 16:49.843
Come here, girl, come here.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.928
Come here. Come here. You alright?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.128
Come here.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.441
The horses?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.526
One got away.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.641
The other one's got
a broken fetlock, I think.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.926
Where are you going?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.404
Jesus Christ, Wyatt.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.251
You're a real genius.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.681
Fuck!

17:39.360 --> 17:40.566
How are we to continue?

17:41.480 --> 17:42.481
Wagon gone,

17:43.120 --> 17:44.485
two horses lost!

17:46.720 --> 17:48.210
You know what?

17:48.320 --> 17:49.526
We got one horse left.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.244
Quit your whining, we'll make do.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.284
The bulk of these supplies was to be
delivered to Hall's man York!

17:54.400 --> 17:55.447
What am I supposed to tell him?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.289
You could tell York to come
and fetch it himself!

17:57.400 --> 18:00.768
Each and every item on this wagon was
duly entered into my log!

18:00.880 --> 18:01.927
I am I am accountable!

18:02.040 --> 18:03.451
You wanna pull that piece?

18:03.600 --> 18:04.965
You gonna stand there like a cunt?

18:06.240 --> 18:10.529
My employer has entrusted me with a task
that I intend to fulfill.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.650
Believe me when I say, sir,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.524
I wish it were otherwise.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.764
We'll continue to the start line
as planned.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.290
He's a good man, York.
Runs a tight ship.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.286
It's the Colonel!

19:05.600 --> 19:06.522
York?

19:08.560 --> 19:09.607
It's Colonel Thomas.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.248
I'm afraid we've lost our wagon

19:15.360 --> 19:17.488
and your shipment
a few miles south from here.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.171
Colonel, is it really you?

19:22.240 --> 19:23.890
Easy. Easy.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.691
These are the carriers.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.566
Carriers?

19:31.520 --> 19:32.760
Have you struck a new vein?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.121
Hey, we ain't going back,
you know that, right?

19:45.440 --> 19:46.487
Wait here.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.602
Ugh!

20:46.280 --> 20:47.725
Is this some kind of a joke?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.047
Joke?

20:49.640 --> 20:50.766
Are you all mad?

20:51.200 --> 20:54.329
- Has this entire company gone mad?
- Yes!

20:55.040 --> 20:56.320
Now you see what I'm up against!

20:56.440 --> 20:58.204
- Degenerative lust. All of them.
- Come on.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.882
Scheming. Plotting against me!
Let's kill them all!

22:04.640 --> 22:05.801
No gold.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.081
Samuel.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.166
What am I looking at?

23:10.840 --> 23:12.001
She'll be all right.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.806
She's a strong woman.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.768
I just wonder how she's doing
with the baby is all.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.045
Still haven't given him a name yet.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.722
Four months old and no name, huh?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.440
Come on...

23:31.200 --> 23:32.122
You know what.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.486
Maybe

23:33.640 --> 23:35.642
you should ask someone who gives a shit.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.841
Which ain't yours truly.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.689
You son of a bitch.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.927
Help me UP.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.204
Come on, brother. You' re OK.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.484
What's the Timber like, Colonel?

25:03.240 --> 25:04.480
Eventful.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.443
You ever met
the fella we're going after?

25:21.760 --> 25:23.683
I'm afraid I have not had that pleasure.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.727
Pleasure?

25:27.280 --> 25:29.362
I can't say as
I ever experienced much in the way

25:29.960 --> 25:31.962
of pleasure in the company of Jebediah.

25:33.680 --> 25:34.841
What about you, Samuel?

25:42.880 --> 25:45.531
Howell tell you that
me and Samuel are kin to Jebediah?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.882
He tell you we ain't seen
him since we was boys?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.048
I believe I'll retire for the night,
gentlemen.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.286
Yeah, you do that.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.171
You been meaning to pick a fight
since you laid eyes on him.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.691
I don't trust the son of a bitch.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.244
You saw what he did to his man York.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.728
You really think he means us harm?

26:27.760 --> 26:31.401
Means it or not, if it comes to that,
I will cut his fucking throat.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.171
I don't know as there's any
call to take it so personal, Wyatt.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.482
If he intends to hurry the reaper,

26:40.920 --> 26:42.570
then by God I call that personal.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.881
Colonel,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.010
one more thing.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.563
Once Mr. Seagrave is dead

26:57.280 --> 26:58.725
kill them both.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.964
You sense it, too.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.406
What's that?

27:48.920 --> 27:50.490
Our demise.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.241
When we was kids,

28:09.720 --> 28:11.768
mother used to chorus Bible verses.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.841
I do remember her saying something

28:15.920 --> 28:18.491
about the road to hell
being paved with good intentions.

28:19.920 --> 28:24.608
I can't say my intentions
have always been good.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.124
In fact, I'd venture to say...

28:32.360 --> 28:33.885
I believe I'm going to hell.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.171
I aimed to kill Jebediah...

28:37.520 --> 28:38.567
Wyatt!

28:51.080 --> 28:52.002
Wyatt!

29:02.280 --> 29:03.202
Wyatt!

29:14.040 --> 29:14.962
Wyatt!

29:15.280 --> 29:16.850
Cut me down! God damn it,

29:28.280 --> 29:29.042
You all right?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.287
I cut my hand.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.726
This is a nightmare.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.727
Where's the horse?

29:41.360 --> 29:42.407
She run off.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.802
Which way?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.207
Where you going?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.769
We'll never make
it back home without a horse.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.770
We ain't going back home.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.966
We're licked, Wyatt.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.127
- Going back...
- We've got no food,

29:57.240 --> 29:58.287
ain't an option.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.327
I pissed my pants, Wyatt...

29:59.480 --> 30:01.847
I was hanging upside down
not five minutes ago with piss

30:01.960 --> 30:05.123
running up my neck!
I'm done. It's over.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.368
What the hell am I doing out here?

30:11.480 --> 30:12.527
Listen.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.645
I've got a wife and baby at home.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.682
Listen to me.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.168
Look at me.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.527
You were the one

30:21.880 --> 30:23.564
that wanted to bring Jebediah back.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.524
You were the one who said
he had to be held accountable.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.290
Well he's not worth dying over.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.400
Now I'm going home, Wyatt.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.690
I'm going home to my wife
and my son where I belong.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.605
You want to come with...

30:42.560 --> 30:43.368
Be my guest.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.891
I ain't going home, Samuel.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.326
Then fare thee well.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.204
I'm afraid it's not enough.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.480
We had a deal.

32:37.520 --> 32:42.162
Taking into account interest accrued,
back taxes, penalties...

32:43.240 --> 32:44.571
In English.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.005
You're still in arrears.

32:51.400 --> 32:56.361
I'm afraid the bank
has no choice but to foreclose

32:56.760 --> 32:58.250
according to the terms
of your contract...

32:58.360 --> 32:59.168
That ain't right!

32:59.280 --> 33:02.011
The contract you co-signed
with your brother.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.401
You have one week to
vacate the premises.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.410
I did what you asked me to.
I got you your gold.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.651
There might be a way.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.522
I don't presume to pry, Rupert,
I am just fucking cold is all.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.920
You know what?

34:24.800 --> 34:28.327
I figure you ain't got
much need for this.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.888
As mine dries out.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.402
Thank you, Rupert. Thank you.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.761
Hell. I ain't coming to get you,
if that's what you think.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.287
Least I'll have my hide
if something happens to you.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.481
Samuel!

36:54.640 --> 36:55.607
Samuel!

37:01.840 --> 37:02.887
Samuel!

37:55.160 --> 37:56.241
Samuel!

38:00.200 --> 38:01.167
Samuel!

38:02.000 --> 38:03.650
Samuel!

38:13.600 --> 38:14.761
Mr. Hawkins?

38:16.200 --> 38:17.521
What the hell are you doing here?

38:18.760 --> 38:19.807
What do you want?

38:21.360 --> 38:22.168
I'm looking for my brother.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.084
We was together. You know, when we...

38:27.480 --> 38:28.402
Hey! Hey!

38:29.040 --> 38:31.486
You get your goddamn hand off me,
you understand?

38:40.720 --> 38:41.562
Is that a bear?

38:42.960 --> 38:44.200
You know where he is?

38:44.640 --> 38:45.761
You're gonna take me to him?

38:45.840 --> 38:46.568
Let's go.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.287
In there?

39:59.680 --> 40:01.284
I take it you ain't coming with me.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.522
Samuel.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.322
Samuel!

40:47.560 --> 40:49.688
Samuel. Samuel, get up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.525
Samuel, it's me!

40:51.920 --> 40:53.206
Wake up, wake up.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.001
It's me.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.565
You stupid son of a bitch.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.008
Lisa would kill me if I didn't get you.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.326
We...

41:15.120 --> 41:16.531
We have to go right now.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.042
Come on.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.522
Samuel, take this.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.247
Go, go, go!

41:51.960 --> 41:52.847
Wyatt!

41:53.440 --> 41:54.123
Samuel

42:12.960 --> 42:13.961
Wyatt!

43:25.440 --> 43:26.487
Let's go.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.928
Have I lived such
a sheltered life, Wyatt?

45:46.800 --> 45:49.246
I used to think it was the gold
that turned men bad,

45:51.720 --> 45:53.006
but now I'm starting to think,

45:54.160 --> 45:56.003
they was just that way to begin with.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.360
I don't want this kind of life
for my son, Wyatt.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.450
I don't... want

46:04.360 --> 46:06.408
to raise him in this kind of world.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.609
It ain't an easy place, this world,
even in the best of times.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.881
Well then I hope damn to make it so.

46:24.960 --> 46:27.327
Or if not easy, at least bearable.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.011
That's a tall order.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.646
The world is as it's always been,

46:34.760 --> 46:35.921
always will be.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.284
God damn your pessimism.

46:42.640 --> 46:45.166
I've seen too much
to believe otherwise, Samuel.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.080
I wish it weren't so.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.723
Jebediah's up there somewhere.

46:59.400 --> 47:02.131
You wanna make
a better world for your boy,

47:04.080 --> 47:06.128
I figure up there
is a good place to start.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.961
We've only got one knife
between the two of us.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.760
We could have come better
equipped is all I'm saying.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.248
Stand back! Let's do it!

48:41.120 --> 48:42.167
I don't care!

48:44.800 --> 48:46.006
State your fucking business.

48:46.360 --> 48:49.170
We're looking for a man
called Jebediah Seagrave.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.480
We' re his sons.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.366
Hey, Jim!

49:27.920 --> 49:31.402
These boys
claim they're kin to Jebediah.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.321
Is that right?

49:47.320 --> 49:48.606
You must be Wyatt.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.527
I am.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.530
The prodigal son.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.731
Prodigal or not, I'm here,
and I'm looking for him.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.007
Where's my father?

50:01.440 --> 50:02.885
He's been expecting you.

50:08.080 --> 50:08.763
Daniel!

50:09.840 --> 50:13.561
This base creature dare
to tempt the divine,

50:14.400 --> 50:17.210
having crawled out of the slime
and called himself king,

50:17.600 --> 50:19.090
while God himself is too modest

50:19.240 --> 50:20.924
to make such a boast...

50:21.600 --> 50:23.409
As if He did not foresee this,

50:23.520 --> 50:26.444
or was not cognizant
of every unfolding step

50:26.560 --> 50:31.771
of this dire plot against his kingdom
by his ungrateful progeny,

50:32.880 --> 50:34.962
which, spewing venom and bile,

50:35.080 --> 50:40.405
He has ordained that his son's
flesh shall be flayed open

50:40.520 --> 50:44.241
until such a time as his black
heart stops beating

50:44.360 --> 50:49.446
and then and only then can
the worm be brought before Him.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.850
Put your backs into it,
you gutless heathens...

51:08.560 --> 51:09.846
Sons of whores,

51:10.320 --> 51:12.163
unfit to breathe the same air

51:12.280 --> 51:14.521
as these wormy, ill-tempered bitches...

51:17.600 --> 51:19.523
The world is cold and lost to me.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.170
Doesn't matter if I'm warm or not.

51:30.160 --> 51:33.084
It's your mind that lies to you,
not the world.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.001
I assure you the world
remains unchanged.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.049
Do you think Lisa
and the boy are safe?

51:45.480 --> 51:47.687
When I close my eyes, I see her here.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.004
But I fear she is dead.

51:55.240 --> 51:58.164
She ain't dead. She's fine.

52:16.880 --> 52:17.767
Look at your hand.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.808
- Alright, okay.
- Fuck.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.481
- God save us all!
- God save us all!

52:41.840 --> 52:42.966
Come on! Come on!

52:43.080 --> 52:44.161
Everybody, back!

54:17.000 --> 54:18.604
Listen to me, you crazy son of a bitch.

54:19.520 --> 54:22.000
You are going to get your sorry ass up

54:22.120 --> 54:23.721
and you are going
to take us to Jebediah.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.602
You understand?

54:25.120 --> 54:26.770
Do you understand me?

55:08.080 --> 55:09.570
I want them off the land,

55:10.480 --> 55:12.801
upright or otherwise,
it makes no difference to me.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.089
A hundred dollar bonus...

55:15.200 --> 55:16.167
per man...

55:16.280 --> 55:17.281
when the job is done.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.527
Push on.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.201
Crow a tune.

56:06.800 --> 56:09.406
Color even,

56:10.520 --> 56:13.490
for an adversity.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.887
Push on a kiss,

56:19.840 --> 56:22.241
all the colors.

56:24.880 --> 56:29.124
By another name, go on.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.281
I used to sing that to your father.

56:37.720 --> 56:41.122
He liked it, yes he did.

57:21.560 --> 57:22.766
We have to turn back.

57:22.880 --> 57:23.767
How much further?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.365
I fear it's too late.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.051
Answer the goddamn question!
How far is it!

57:29.160 --> 57:31.322
Not far. Not far at all.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.445
I heard you was expecting us.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.285
You came to kill me.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.327
I did.

59:27.560 --> 59:29.130
He came to take you back.

59:43.440 --> 59:46.842
I never amounted to much,
and I doubt that I ever will.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.002
But Samuel is worth saving.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.444
We are the same you and I.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.726
Doomed to live in woe
to labor in darkness.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.810
Like hell we are.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.364
You came to kill me...

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.961
Do it.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.561
Samuel.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.529
No. No!

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.127
Who are you to judge me?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.730
To try to understand and comprehend
that which broods over me?

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.927
The burdens I shoulder?

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.208
Worlds that I command,

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.842
bursting forth in bone
and flesh and blood!

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.846
You must be Lisa.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.529
I have here a notice of foreclosure.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.566
Fully notarized.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.047
This... is our land.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.442
None of the lies or false claims
in the world will change that.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.250
Turn your horses and ride off.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.241
Kindly escort
the Seagraves from my property.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.120
Father!

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.246
Stop this.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.011
He came here to die.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.967
Let him.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.331
Cut him down!

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.645
He chose his fate,

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.167
just as you have chosen yours.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.886
There's a baby.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.010
Do you not remember me?

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.566
Or Wyatt?

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.089
I do not recognize you.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.444
There's a baby inside.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.971
Not another step.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.283
I came to take you back.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.083
There's no going back, is there?

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.842
Maggie!

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.000
There is a woman on the inside.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.682
Howell!

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.971
Lisa, Lisa.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.890
Maggie.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.406
You wouldn't happen
to have a swig of whiskey on you?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.604
It ain't so bad as I feared.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.689
Don't die, Wyatt.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:00.441
Wyatt.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.725
Wyatt.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.086
I wanted to tell you
how I felt about you, Maggie,

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.121
but my own cowardice prevented me,

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.044
and now that you're gone,

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.526
it's my grief that stops me.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.721
Hey, Sheriff!

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.121
What?

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.285
Oil.
