WEBVTT

00:00.187 --> 00:02.124
It's a beautiful day outside.

00:02.145 --> 00:04.379
Streets are packed with tourists.

00:04.381 --> 00:07.248
They're drinking beers,
they're chasing beads,

00:07.250 --> 00:11.219
headed out on the vampire
walking tour of New Orleans.

00:11.221 --> 00:14.055
They think it's just a myth.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.724
Just part of our city's charm.

00:16.726 --> 00:20.828
Well, we know better.

00:20.830 --> 00:25.066
Just like we know... that
there's a storm coming.

00:26.555 --> 00:28.885
This week marks five years

00:28.906 --> 00:31.439
since the fall of the Mikaelsons.

00:31.441 --> 00:33.675
Five years of peace.

00:33.677 --> 00:36.444
And we paid a high price for that peace.

00:38.094 --> 00:39.948
We witches...

00:39.950 --> 00:41.883
we earned that peace.

00:41.885 --> 00:43.492
We snatched back our freedom,

00:43.513 --> 00:45.393
we severed our link with our ancestors.

00:47.824 --> 00:50.959
To take back our city,
we backed Marcel Gerard.

00:54.464 --> 00:58.900
Now, since then, we fought
hard to build this community.

00:58.902 --> 01:01.035
And in the next week,

01:01.037 --> 01:03.071
as we celebrate our independence,

01:03.073 --> 01:07.442
that community will be challenged...

01:07.444 --> 01:10.078
because every year we get visitors.

01:11.781 --> 01:14.015
Vampires.

01:14.017 --> 01:16.805
Vampires from all over the world...

01:16.826 --> 01:19.187
They come here, and they
want to see firsthand

01:19.189 --> 01:22.857
the suffering of Klaus Mikaelson.

01:22.859 --> 01:25.793
Now some of those vampires...
They're gonna be well-behaved.

01:28.183 --> 01:31.199
Others...

01:31.201 --> 01:33.801
not so much.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.504
You see, out-of-town vampires...

01:36.506 --> 01:38.539
They don't care about our city.

01:38.541 --> 01:40.942
They don't follow our rules.

01:40.944 --> 01:43.011
They will instigate trouble.

01:43.013 --> 01:47.482
They will attempt to upset our peace.

01:47.484 --> 01:50.051
And the only way that
we're gonna get through that

01:50.053 --> 01:53.388
is if we get through that together.

01:53.390 --> 01:56.624
Now, this ain't the first
time that we faced conflict.

01:56.626 --> 01:58.693
Each and every single one of us here

01:58.695 --> 02:01.496
has faced their fair share of monsters.

02:01.498 --> 02:03.199
I swear, I feel sometimes

02:03.220 --> 02:06.067
the city just has evil
lurking in the shadows.

02:06.069 --> 02:08.788
For a long time,

02:08.809 --> 02:11.472
we've managed to keep
our monsters buried.

02:13.009 --> 02:15.931
And now we've got to make
sure that they stay buried.

02:18.081 --> 02:21.849
Otherwise, we will lose

02:21.851 --> 02:24.485
everything that we've built.

02:26.489 --> 02:28.956
We will lose it...

02:28.958 --> 02:31.359
forever.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:42.839 --> 02:46.107
To five years of independence.

02:46.109 --> 02:48.810
And old enemies who became new friends.

02:48.812 --> 02:51.546
I thought you said this was
strictly a business meeting.

02:51.548 --> 02:54.882
Oh, you didn't mind last time
we mixed business with pleasure.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.418
You pay me for information,

02:57.420 --> 03:00.688
and I have quite a bit to share.

03:00.690 --> 03:03.291
As predicted, Klaus'
enemies are flocking

03:03.293 --> 03:05.226
to New Orleans to celebrate.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.929
However, some are seeking
allies among your witches.

03:07.931 --> 03:09.430
No doubt they want to befriend

03:09.432 --> 03:11.265
the very covens that still resent you,

03:11.267 --> 03:14.001
start conflict, undermine your power,

03:14.003 --> 03:16.637
and perhaps steal your prize trophy.

03:16.639 --> 03:19.107
Klaus himself.

03:19.109 --> 03:21.576
Oh. How diabolical.

03:21.578 --> 03:24.345
It's a good thing I called
a truce with the witches.

03:24.347 --> 03:26.514
Vincent wants peace as much as I do.

03:26.516 --> 03:28.549
So you've said, but

03:28.551 --> 03:31.185
I'm hearing that the
covens are up to something.

03:31.187 --> 03:34.522
Sigil markings on the walls,
secret midnight meetings.

03:34.524 --> 03:36.657
Maybe Vincent doesn't know,

03:36.659 --> 03:38.626
or maybe he's planning a power grab.

03:38.628 --> 03:41.929
I will ask him myself.

03:43.366 --> 03:46.033
Better make it fast, because
you have bigger problems.

03:46.035 --> 03:47.869
Oh, if you're talking
about Hayley Marshall,

03:47.871 --> 03:49.303
I said she's off-limits.

03:49.305 --> 03:52.240
Fine, but there are others

03:52.242 --> 03:55.076
who will stop at nothing to find her.

03:55.078 --> 03:57.278
Alistair Duquesne for one.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.814
He and his allies believe Hayley

03:59.816 --> 04:02.106
is the key to finding the
rest of the Mikaelsons.

04:02.127 --> 04:04.152
So Alistair's going after Hayley?

04:04.154 --> 04:05.753
Alistair is here.

04:05.755 --> 04:08.422
Ostensibly for the
independence celebration,

04:08.424 --> 04:11.058
but I believe he will demand
you give him Klaus' blood,

04:11.060 --> 04:14.428
which he will then use
to track Klaus' siblings.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.464
Or his child.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.120
No one has seen or heard from
the Mikaelsons in half a decade.

04:20.141 --> 04:22.703
Alistair's hunted down
members of the Strix.

04:22.705 --> 04:25.006
He offers them as proof:

04:25.008 --> 04:28.075
if Elijah's sire line
is alive, so is Elijah.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.159
Which leads people to wonder

04:31.180 --> 04:34.382
if Hayley is somehow trying
to bring the Mikaelsons back.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:33.251 --> 05:34.742
Is that her?

05:34.744 --> 05:37.011
Let me check.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.846
Stay inside.

06:04.468 --> 06:05.973
Well, now,

06:05.975 --> 06:07.909
aren't you a sight?

06:07.911 --> 06:09.577
You're sure no one followed you?

06:09.579 --> 06:13.114
I've been avoiding trouble
since well before you were born.

06:13.116 --> 06:14.548
Now, where's that little girl?

06:14.550 --> 06:15.917
Did you find it?

06:15.919 --> 06:18.019
Mary, please.

06:18.021 --> 06:21.389
After all this time, I am this
close to getting them back.

06:21.391 --> 06:23.457
I found a cure for Freya's poison,

06:23.459 --> 06:25.660
I got a witch to syphon Rebekah's hex.

06:25.662 --> 06:27.428
So you're really gonna do it?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.196
Cure 'em and then wake 'em up?

06:29.198 --> 06:32.400
Did you ever stop to think, Hope
might be better off without 'em?

06:32.402 --> 06:34.802
I made a promise.

06:34.804 --> 06:36.604
To who? To Elijah?

06:36.606 --> 06:38.072
To my daughter.

06:38.074 --> 06:40.474
I promised her a home
where she would feel safe

06:40.476 --> 06:43.177
and protected by the
people that love her.

06:45.181 --> 06:47.315
Mary...

06:47.317 --> 06:48.849
she's a Mikaelson, too.

06:48.851 --> 06:51.759
She's inherited all of their enemies

06:51.780 --> 06:55.423
and a power that... I don't understand.

06:55.425 --> 06:58.859
She needs someone to
teach her to control it.

06:58.861 --> 07:00.920
I can't do this on my own.

07:03.199 --> 07:05.599
You told me to wake the
Mikaelsons you needed

07:05.601 --> 07:07.802
to find all seven werewolf packs.

07:07.804 --> 07:10.938
You found six.

07:10.940 --> 07:14.275
The last one... the Malraux...

07:14.277 --> 07:16.811
I thought they'd been killed off.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.116
According to this,

07:22.118 --> 07:25.052
there might be one left.

07:25.054 --> 07:28.089
Hayley. You looked for five years.

07:28.091 --> 07:29.890
You found nothing.

07:29.892 --> 07:32.760
Suddenly, I get word of a lead.

07:32.762 --> 07:36.063
What if someone else found it, too?

07:36.065 --> 07:37.965
What if it's a trap?

08:00.690 --> 08:03.224
Your royal highness.

08:04.694 --> 08:06.827
And to what do I owe this great honor?

08:06.829 --> 08:08.829
All right, all right,
take it down a notch.

08:08.831 --> 08:11.165
- Is he here?
- In the back.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.534
He was just raving about
your awesome punctuality.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.902
Good crowd.

08:14.904 --> 08:18.472
Witches, vampires.
Everyone getting along?

08:18.474 --> 08:22.209
We're like Switzerland, right
smack in the heart of the city.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.944
Everything Cami wanted.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.815
Okay, I got to run.

08:27.817 --> 08:29.483
Spinning records all week.

08:29.485 --> 08:32.253
You know...

08:37.260 --> 08:38.893
Vincent.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.528
Appreciate you coming.

08:40.530 --> 08:43.431
You're a little late, but I
guess you got a city to run.

08:43.433 --> 08:46.100
Yeah, it'd be a lot easier if I
knew the witches were in check.

08:46.102 --> 08:47.334
The cauldron will stay in line,

08:47.336 --> 08:48.736
provided you keep the vampires out.

08:48.738 --> 08:50.838
So why am I hearing
about secret conclaves,

08:50.840 --> 08:52.740
sigils scribbled on the walls?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.242
Sounds like someone's
stirring up trouble.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.645
Marcel, these out-of-town vampires

08:57.647 --> 08:59.814
got you a little bit paranoid, man.

08:59.816 --> 09:01.649
All right, look, I'm asking you,

09:01.651 --> 09:03.884
especially this week,
handle your community.

09:03.886 --> 09:05.586
Keep them in the cauldron.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.221
Find out who's stirring up
trouble, and when you do,

09:07.223 --> 09:08.556
get 'em to stop.

09:08.558 --> 09:10.691
As far as our out-of-town friends go,

09:10.693 --> 09:13.461
if they act up, I'll handle 'em.

09:49.044 --> 09:53.400
Have you come to taunt me, Marcellus?

09:53.402 --> 09:55.469
No.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.305
I came to have a nice,
civilized conversation.

10:00.319 --> 10:02.011
I think we're overdue.

10:09.255 --> 10:10.691
Not much to say?

10:12.859 --> 10:15.732
And here I thought
you'd enjoy the company.

10:15.734 --> 10:18.468
What I would most enjoy...

10:18.470 --> 10:21.671
is for you to rot in hell.

10:21.673 --> 10:25.942
Look, there's two ways this can go.

10:25.944 --> 10:28.979
The nice, easy way...

10:28.981 --> 10:32.482
or the other way.

10:32.484 --> 10:35.518
You know, once I figured

10:35.520 --> 10:38.188
you suffered enough, I pulled this out.

10:38.190 --> 10:39.956
And on that day you said a word

10:39.958 --> 10:41.925
that I've never heard you say.

10:41.927 --> 10:44.294
"Mercy."

10:45.297 --> 10:48.198
Why not just kill me?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.367
Because I'm not like you.

10:50.369 --> 10:51.668
I'm stronger than you.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.336
My life is no longer linked to you,

10:53.338 --> 10:55.138
and the city that you like to say

10:55.140 --> 10:57.173
you built... it's mine.

10:57.175 --> 10:59.776
Did you come here seeking my approval?

10:59.778 --> 11:02.379
I came for a little information.

11:02.381 --> 11:05.615
See, an old friend of yours
just arrived into town.

11:05.617 --> 11:07.217
Alistair Duquesne.

11:07.219 --> 11:10.420
Word is... might even
cause me some trouble.

11:10.422 --> 11:12.022
Now, I could kill him.

11:12.024 --> 11:14.758
But who knows what kind
of war that might start.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.993
I would rather convince
him to get into line.

11:16.995 --> 11:19.796
You're gonna tell me how.

11:19.798 --> 11:23.433
So, how do you want this to go?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.979
Pride was always Alistair's weakness.

11:35.981 --> 11:39.382
Even before I turned him
he was a vain aristocrat,

11:39.384 --> 11:42.185
throwing feasts in his own honor.

11:42.187 --> 11:45.221
Just show him more of the same.

11:45.223 --> 11:47.957
You'll find him quite malleable.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.045
Do you have to go?

12:09.047 --> 12:10.380
I do.

12:10.382 --> 12:12.682
But I'll be back very, very soon.

12:14.219 --> 12:16.219
And I won't be alone.

12:18.990 --> 12:22.292
I'll call you every
night before bed, okay?

12:22.294 --> 12:24.260
In the meantime,

12:24.262 --> 12:27.197
you listen to Mary. Deal?

12:31.207 --> 12:32.587
Deal.

12:39.544 --> 12:42.078
Keep your guard up. Stay moving.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.139
You smell trouble, you run.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.683
Those folks back there,
they had plenty of life.

12:46.685 --> 12:49.619
What you need to do is stay
alive for your little girl.

12:49.621 --> 12:51.821
Everything I do is for her.

13:03.802 --> 13:06.035
Adam, get back here.

13:09.307 --> 13:11.141
What's up, little witch dude?

13:11.143 --> 13:13.243
Whoa. You're a vampire.

13:13.245 --> 13:15.745
I know. And I got the
teeth and everything.

13:16.448 --> 13:18.515
Whoa.

13:18.517 --> 13:19.949
Adam.

13:19.951 --> 13:21.484
Say you're sorry. Now.

13:21.505 --> 13:22.609
Sorry.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.254
It's okay.

13:25.757 --> 13:27.524
Maxine, let me help you with that.

13:27.526 --> 13:28.992
He doesn't listen.

13:28.994 --> 13:31.728
Maybe I should stick
him in a boundary spell.

13:31.730 --> 13:34.964
He'll grow out of it. Just
give him a couple decades.

13:34.966 --> 13:37.167
That's optimistic.

13:38.436 --> 13:41.604
Anyway, uh, thank you.

13:41.606 --> 13:44.641
For all of this.

13:44.643 --> 13:47.977
Oh. Well, just trying to make
sure everybody's stocked up

13:47.979 --> 13:49.646
so they'll stay in their
home and out of the Quarter,

13:49.648 --> 13:51.080
at least for the next week, you know.

13:51.082 --> 13:52.715
Yeah, just until the,
uh, Eurotrash vampires

13:52.717 --> 13:54.484
are done Eurotrashing the city.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.886
Well, it means a lot,

13:56.888 --> 13:58.488
you looking out for the covens.

13:58.490 --> 14:00.824
Um...

14:06.898 --> 14:08.431
Hey, Casanova,

14:08.433 --> 14:10.700
uh, I may be going
out on a limb here, but

14:10.702 --> 14:13.069
- she's into you.
- Maxine?

14:13.071 --> 14:16.039
Fun, cool, ridiculously
gorgeous single mom?

14:16.041 --> 14:17.540
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.309
But, hey, if you'd rather be a monk

14:19.311 --> 14:21.444
the rest of your life...

14:23.932 --> 14:26.416
Um, Maxine.

14:26.418 --> 14:28.852
Look here, um,

14:28.854 --> 14:32.422
over the next week, if you
need anything, I-I could...

14:32.424 --> 14:36.159
I don't know, that is to say that...

14:36.161 --> 14:39.162
Well, I'm definitely gonna make a mess

14:39.164 --> 14:40.597
out of all these groceries,

14:40.599 --> 14:43.166
so if you want to help with that...

14:44.536 --> 14:47.437
...come by for dinner tonight.

14:47.439 --> 14:49.405
All right.

15:06.191 --> 15:09.025
Very nice.

15:09.027 --> 15:11.961
I took that from a sultan.

15:11.963 --> 15:14.364
It is a blade meant for a king.

15:14.366 --> 15:17.033
Given in gratitude for your generosity.

15:17.035 --> 15:19.969
Alistair, I like your style.

15:19.971 --> 15:22.505
Now, allow me to return the favor.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.607
70-year-old Scotch,

15:24.609 --> 15:27.110
in honor of your native
Scottish Highlands.

15:27.112 --> 15:30.413
To be enjoyed along with our feast.

15:44.829 --> 15:46.162
Now, that...

15:46.164 --> 15:48.698
that is a kind gesture.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.400
Though I don't believe

15:50.402 --> 15:52.435
one can be free

15:52.437 --> 15:54.938
if one's oppressor still lives.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.375
Niklaus turned me

15:59.377 --> 16:02.278
and then he compelled me to
slaughter my entire estate,

16:02.280 --> 16:04.547
including my wife and my child.

16:04.549 --> 16:07.817
All so that I could
serve as a distraction

16:07.819 --> 16:09.919
to lure away his vile father.

16:09.921 --> 16:13.073
I spent a century hiding in the shadows.

16:13.094 --> 16:14.524
Where is my justice?

16:14.526 --> 16:16.025
Hmm?

16:16.027 --> 16:18.906
Now, five years ago,
you made him suffer.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.296
And you tell us

16:20.298 --> 16:22.899
that he suffers still, and yet

16:22.901 --> 16:24.801
we have no proof.

16:24.803 --> 16:26.703
And now the only thing that prevents him

16:26.705 --> 16:29.772
from returning to wreak untold havoc

16:29.774 --> 16:31.474
is your word.

16:31.476 --> 16:33.476
I have him right where I want him.

16:34.579 --> 16:36.045
He's not going anywhere.

16:36.047 --> 16:37.847
Then I want to see his suffering

16:37.849 --> 16:39.375
with my own eyes.

16:39.396 --> 16:41.529
And perhaps procure just

16:41.550 --> 16:43.119
a drop of his blood.

16:43.121 --> 16:44.988
If only to test a theory.

16:46.293 --> 16:48.159
See, we've known for some time

16:48.180 --> 16:51.027
that Elijah Mikaelson
somehow still lives.

16:51.029 --> 16:53.129
My witch advisors suggest that his life

16:53.131 --> 16:56.132
is linked to some
powerful, immortal force.

16:56.134 --> 16:59.135
Now, I believe that to be Klaus himself.

16:59.137 --> 17:01.435
Well, that's an interesting theory.

17:01.456 --> 17:03.573
Klaus' blood will allow
us to confirm that link.

17:03.575 --> 17:05.875
And, if true...

17:05.877 --> 17:09.278
well, surely that would
be cause to kill him

17:09.280 --> 17:12.015
and eradicate his
abominable family as well.

17:13.251 --> 17:15.251
You kill Klaus,

17:15.252 --> 17:17.185
it will ease the minds

17:17.188 --> 17:19.821
of all of your brethren.

17:19.824 --> 17:21.324
Refuse,

17:21.326 --> 17:24.093
it will prove you to be a sympathizer.

17:24.095 --> 17:28.031
Well, I don't know about a sympathizer.

17:28.032 --> 17:29.866
But I do know

17:29.887 --> 17:32.510
that I don't take ultimatums.

17:34.139 --> 17:36.205
You know, it's bad form

17:36.207 --> 17:37.940
to deny your guests.

17:37.942 --> 17:40.176
It could sour their mood.

17:40.178 --> 17:42.412
And it would be an awful,

17:42.414 --> 17:44.213
awful shame if I

17:44.215 --> 17:47.517
or any of my followers
were to go into your city

17:47.519 --> 17:49.652
with a soured mood.

17:49.654 --> 17:52.405
A bloody awful shame, indeed.

17:54.092 --> 17:56.926
Well, now, Alistair...

17:56.928 --> 17:59.162
I never meant to be rude.

17:59.164 --> 18:01.264
How about we settle this tonight?

18:01.266 --> 18:03.099
The Mikaelson compound.

18:03.101 --> 18:04.767
Midnight.

18:07.405 --> 18:10.973
_

18:16.948 --> 18:19.916
All right, ladies, do
not slow down on me.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.317
Cheers.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.423
Ooh! I'm getting the next round.

18:27.425 --> 18:30.159
Just take a sec, pull
yourselves together.

18:32.664 --> 18:35.364
Another round, please. Thanks.

18:37.068 --> 18:38.901
Beer, please.

18:38.903 --> 18:41.637
You look like you're having
fun. What's the occasion?

18:41.639 --> 18:44.373
I just finished my residency,

18:44.375 --> 18:46.409
which makes me an official ER doctor.

18:46.411 --> 18:48.377
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

18:48.379 --> 18:51.280
Does it help with the
guilt, given what you are?

18:52.417 --> 18:53.783
What did you say?

18:53.785 --> 18:56.552
Keelin, you need to listen to me.

18:56.554 --> 18:59.122
- How do you know my name?
- Got it from a friend.

18:59.124 --> 19:01.657
She said your grandma's
maiden name was Malraux.

19:03.761 --> 19:06.863
You better back off. Right now.

19:06.865 --> 19:09.098
I wish I could.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.367
I need a favor.

19:11.369 --> 19:14.003
Five minutes. Outside. I can explain.

19:31.322 --> 19:33.689
_

19:52.243 --> 19:53.843
Do not do that again.

19:53.845 --> 19:56.145
- I'm not going without a fight.
- Would you relax?

19:56.147 --> 19:59.682
I'm not here to fight you. I need you.

19:59.684 --> 20:01.584
You're the last of your
pack. That makes you special

20:01.586 --> 20:03.653
for reasons that are too
complicated to explain.

20:03.655 --> 20:05.688
- I don't care about your problems.
- You should.

20:05.690 --> 20:08.457
Because there are others who
know how important you are.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.260
And they will come for you.

20:11.262 --> 20:14.136
Look, I have a life, a
career, relationships.

20:14.157 --> 20:15.831
Someone tries to take that,
they're gonna have to kill me.

20:15.833 --> 20:18.534
Where is she?

20:18.536 --> 20:20.203
I'm sorry.

20:20.205 --> 20:21.753
We don't have time for this.

20:28.798 --> 20:30.841
Marcellus.

20:30.862 --> 20:34.234
Can I assume your soiree for
Alistair was a raging success?

20:34.236 --> 20:37.504
Alistair doesn't give a damn
about having his ego stroked.

20:37.506 --> 20:38.939
He used the party for the audience,

20:38.941 --> 20:40.841
so he could throw down a challenge.

20:40.843 --> 20:43.811
Or is that what you intended?

20:43.813 --> 20:45.779
How difficult to be king.

20:45.781 --> 20:48.449
An outsider has the gall
to question your rule

20:48.451 --> 20:50.951
and you have no one to offer counsel.

20:52.221 --> 20:53.821
You think I don't know.

20:53.823 --> 20:57.491
The day after I bit
Elijah he should have died.

20:57.493 --> 20:59.746
But his sire line is still out there.

20:59.767 --> 21:03.330
So I had Vincent cast a spell
to figure out how that could be.

21:03.332 --> 21:06.916
It turns out the lines of your
siblings are anchored to you.

21:06.937 --> 21:09.428
Now, I don't give a
damn about the others,

21:09.430 --> 21:11.697
but I'm not gonna let
anything happen to Rebekah.

21:11.699 --> 21:14.533
Lucky for me, my sister
still holds your fancy.

21:14.535 --> 21:17.135
You may have no choice
but to kill poor Alistair.

21:17.137 --> 21:21.373
Ah, well, heavy head, heavy
crown, et cetera, et cetera.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.076
If I kill Alistair, his
theory gains traction.

21:24.078 --> 21:26.745
The vampires turn against
me. They storm the city.

21:26.747 --> 21:30.148
And if they find you, all they
need is a drop of your blood,

21:30.150 --> 21:32.918
and then their witches
can track your family.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.418
Even Hope.

21:37.157 --> 21:39.124
But, hey,

21:39.126 --> 21:41.488
I guess that's my problem, right?

21:41.509 --> 21:42.718
Marcel.

21:44.798 --> 21:46.331
You don't know Alistair.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.500
To defeat him, you need me.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.305
You're offering me a deal?

21:53.307 --> 21:55.173
One you cannot dismiss.

21:55.175 --> 21:57.709
Alistair and his ilk loathed
me because of my strength.

21:57.711 --> 21:59.111
Now they loathe you.

21:59.113 --> 22:02.314
Creatures such as they
respect only one language,

22:02.316 --> 22:04.216
and I speak it fluently.

22:04.218 --> 22:08.687
Release me, and I will lay
waste to the lot of them.

22:21.936 --> 22:25.304
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

22:25.306 --> 22:27.606
If I left you where you
were, you'd be dead already.

22:27.608 --> 22:30.142
Let me guess, we're on
the run from vampires?

22:30.144 --> 22:31.944
You have the same stink they do.

22:31.946 --> 22:34.880
I'm special. I'm a hybrid.

22:34.882 --> 22:36.615
Half-vampire, half-werewolf.

22:36.636 --> 22:39.153
And considering that I saved your ass,

22:39.174 --> 22:40.919
you should show me some respect.

22:40.921 --> 22:41.820
How do I know you weren't the one

22:41.840 --> 22:43.622
- that led them to me?
- Does it matter?

22:43.624 --> 22:45.624
They know who you are
and they want you dead.

22:45.626 --> 22:49.241
The only way to survive is
to do exactly what I tell you.

22:49.262 --> 22:50.963
It's not like I have a choice.

22:52.766 --> 22:55.000
Hey, look, I don't know what
kind of pervy stuff you're into,

22:55.002 --> 22:56.668
but I am not that kind of girl.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.804
This is a device to extract your venom.

22:58.806 --> 23:00.632
And before you ask, yes,

23:00.653 --> 23:01.873
it will hurt.

23:05.646 --> 23:08.220
Why are you doing this to me?

23:10.718 --> 23:13.452
I'm trying to save my family.

23:14.355 --> 23:16.154
Keelin,

23:16.156 --> 23:18.357
the people in there are dying.

23:18.359 --> 23:20.158
The only thing keeping them alive

23:20.160 --> 23:23.762
is a sleep spell, and the only
one that can cure them is her.

23:23.764 --> 23:26.031
She's a witch, and she
left me instructions

23:26.033 --> 23:27.599
on how to wake her up early.

23:27.601 --> 23:29.935
The only thing I'm missing

23:29.937 --> 23:31.503
is your venom.

23:31.505 --> 23:33.238
Once she gets on her
feet, I can give her

23:33.240 --> 23:34.206
the ingredients I got.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.208
And, with any luck,

23:36.210 --> 23:38.343
no one has to die.

23:38.345 --> 23:42.347
So if I give you what you want...

23:42.349 --> 23:44.483
will you let me go?

23:44.485 --> 23:47.219
You have my word.

23:53.534 --> 23:55.894
Appreciate you coming on short notice.

23:55.896 --> 23:57.763
Marcel, just tell me what you need, man,

23:57.765 --> 24:00.599
because, um, I-I kind of
got someplace I got to be.

24:00.601 --> 24:02.768
Whatever your plans are, I got
to ask you to put 'em aside.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.003
- Tonight I need you here.
- What is that?

24:05.024 --> 24:06.798
Is that a decree from the royal throne?

24:06.800 --> 24:09.041
All right, look, it would be
best for everyone in this city

24:09.043 --> 24:10.809
if you're here for what's going down.

24:12.479 --> 24:14.846
If you need me to say
"please," Vincent, I will.

24:14.848 --> 24:16.856
What have you gotten
yourself into, Marcel?

24:16.877 --> 24:18.450
- You about to start a war?
- No.

24:18.452 --> 24:21.053
If this goes the way I expect,
I won't have to lift a finger.

24:21.055 --> 24:22.354
All I need from you

24:22.356 --> 24:25.013
is a boundary spell.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.758
Anyone can enter,

24:26.760 --> 24:28.226
no one can leave.

24:28.228 --> 24:29.628
And it's got to be strong.

24:29.630 --> 24:31.063
Well, how strong?

24:31.065 --> 24:33.764
Original strength.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.440
You got my venom. When do I get to go?

24:41.442 --> 24:44.785
As soon as I know it works.

24:44.806 --> 24:46.144
And when will that be?

24:46.146 --> 24:47.746
Believe me,

24:47.748 --> 24:49.457
you'll know when you see it.

24:49.478 --> 24:51.383
You have to wake up
Sleeping Beauty, right?

24:51.385 --> 24:53.552
How do you do that?

24:53.554 --> 24:57.189
You know, you ask a lot of questions.

25:08.102 --> 25:09.701
Freya.

25:09.703 --> 25:11.736
Are you okay?

25:11.738 --> 25:13.171
Did you get the ingredients?

25:14.041 --> 25:16.274
Good, I need to begin.

25:16.276 --> 25:18.643
If I can't turn all that into a cure...

25:18.645 --> 25:21.079
Elijah and Kol are going to die.

25:26.113 --> 25:28.026
How much longer do we have?

25:28.028 --> 25:29.995
Maybe an hour.

25:30.016 --> 25:33.017
Assuming they live that long.

25:33.038 --> 25:35.300
Do you have everything we need?

25:35.302 --> 25:37.969
Venom from the seven packs,

25:37.971 --> 25:39.504
along with Klaus' blood.

25:39.506 --> 25:41.807
Infused by my magic and
magnified by the Dark Objects.

25:41.809 --> 25:43.642
It's going to take all of my strength

25:43.644 --> 25:45.477
and more than a little luck, but...

25:45.479 --> 25:47.946
it should be enough to fashion
a cure to save my brothers.

25:47.948 --> 25:50.082
"Should"? What do you mean "should"?

26:09.033 --> 26:10.436
We got company.

26:10.457 --> 26:12.574
Hayley, let me go, please.

26:12.595 --> 26:14.306
If it's vampires, they're gonna kill me.

26:14.308 --> 26:15.507
They must have been tracking her.

26:15.509 --> 26:18.118
Hayley, I need more time.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.387
These guys are sketchy.

26:29.389 --> 26:31.418
- Stay close.
- What are you gonna do?

26:31.439 --> 26:32.791
You gonna protect me?

26:32.793 --> 26:35.360
No, I'm gonna use you as a shield.

26:35.362 --> 26:38.063
Just so you know,

26:38.065 --> 26:39.965
Alistair is in a mood.

26:39.967 --> 26:42.634
He has his men positioned all
over town awaiting his signal.

26:46.907 --> 26:48.306
Greetings, Marcel.

26:48.308 --> 26:50.408
I had hoped your decision

26:50.410 --> 26:54.346
to meet in this... ruin had
meant you'd come to your senses.

26:54.348 --> 26:57.482
And yet I don't see
Klaus' head upon a spike.

27:01.332 --> 27:02.988
Apologies.

27:02.990 --> 27:05.332
I have been a discourteous host.

27:11.765 --> 27:13.832
You wanted him,

27:13.834 --> 27:15.167
you got him.

27:19.773 --> 27:23.108
Oh, Niklaus.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.358
How the mighty have fallen.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.312
Pretty pathetic.

27:27.314 --> 27:28.513
Chained.

27:28.515 --> 27:31.550
Beaten. Half-starved.

27:31.552 --> 27:32.784
I should just kill him.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.819
After all, a wise man said,

27:34.821 --> 27:36.388
"One cannot be free if one's oppressors

27:36.390 --> 27:38.190
continue to live."

27:38.192 --> 27:40.525
And what I've learned is,

27:40.527 --> 27:43.595
the best way to end your fear

27:43.597 --> 27:47.599
is to face it yourself.
So, for you, a gift,

27:47.601 --> 27:50.969
the sword that you gave
me, now laced with my venom.

27:50.971 --> 27:53.004
One slice

27:53.006 --> 27:54.272
will draw Klaus' blood

27:54.293 --> 27:57.389
and deliver the slow, agonizing death

27:57.410 --> 27:59.011
that he deserves.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.315
It would be...

28:05.052 --> 28:06.518
...my highest honor.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.573
Took a long time,

28:28.575 --> 28:30.775
but we finally caught you.

28:30.777 --> 28:33.311
Or maybe I just stopped running.

28:55.576 --> 28:57.743
Do you suffer, Niklaus,

28:57.745 --> 29:00.212
as my wife suffered?

29:00.214 --> 29:03.482
As my child suffered?

29:05.219 --> 29:07.486
Yeah, you do.

29:07.488 --> 29:09.855
But I do believe, at
long last, your suffering

29:09.857 --> 29:10.822
is at an end.

29:10.824 --> 29:12.324
Kill him!

29:12.326 --> 29:14.393
Do you hear that?

29:14.395 --> 29:16.028
The people have spoken.

29:16.030 --> 29:19.765
Now, honor would dictate a
request for your last words,

29:19.786 --> 29:21.848
but you deserve no such privilege.

29:21.869 --> 29:24.903
Instead, I want the
last words you ever hear

29:24.905 --> 29:27.406
to be my solemn vow.

29:27.408 --> 29:28.874
I will find your daughter.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.176
And when I do, I will eradicate

29:31.178 --> 29:34.713
your malignant bloodline
from... this... earth.

29:59.540 --> 30:02.608
Well, who's next?!

30:04.278 --> 30:07.379
Oh, come on.

30:07.381 --> 30:11.483
Meet... your... maker.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.886
Mmm.

30:14.888 --> 30:17.155
That is a nasty bite.

30:17.157 --> 30:20.158
The good news is, we have the cure.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.161
You see, keeping Klaus
alive does come in handy.

30:23.163 --> 30:25.564
I keep him for his blood,

30:25.566 --> 30:27.299
in case the wolves get out of line.

30:27.301 --> 30:29.067
I keep him as collateral,

30:29.069 --> 30:30.469
in case his family comes back.

30:30.471 --> 30:34.172
I keep him, because I can.

30:34.174 --> 30:36.408
I put him down, I kept him down,

30:36.410 --> 30:39.841
and I am the only one that can stop him

30:39.862 --> 30:41.818
from coming after all of you.

30:47.135 --> 30:49.254
New Orleans is mine.

30:49.256 --> 30:51.362
But you are all welcome to visit.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.924
Enjoy yourselves.

30:52.926 --> 30:54.893
But you follow my rules.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.795
You behave.

30:56.797 --> 30:58.797
And you never,

30:58.799 --> 31:02.334
ever question me.

31:02.336 --> 31:05.125
Does anybody have a problem with that?

31:07.941 --> 31:09.758
All right then.

31:11.311 --> 31:13.745
Well, let's go celebrate.

31:18.385 --> 31:20.986
Laekna det som er

31:20.988 --> 31:24.089
toxicatus. Laeknadet som

31:24.091 --> 31:27.192
er toxicatus.

31:27.792 --> 31:30.262
Laekna det som er toxicatus.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.764
Close your eyes, you
blood-sucking punk-ass.

31:38.639 --> 31:40.038
You just...

31:40.040 --> 31:42.074
You waved your hand
and his brain melted?

31:42.076 --> 31:44.710
Well, that's what happens
when people annoy me.

31:50.150 --> 31:53.018
Ooh.

31:53.020 --> 31:55.053
Your bite is nasty.

31:55.055 --> 31:57.122
But you're outnumbered.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.658
Give up now and we'll end this quick.

31:59.660 --> 32:01.419
I have a better idea.

32:14.475 --> 32:17.542
Laekna det som er toxicatus.

32:17.615 --> 32:21.113
Laekna det som er toxicatus.

32:21.232 --> 32:25.117
Laekna det som er toxicatus.

32:25.216 --> 32:29.287
Laekna det som er toxicatus.

32:35.142 --> 32:36.413
Did it work?

33:17.938 --> 33:20.272
You want more?

33:20.274 --> 33:21.807
Come on!

34:09.199 --> 34:10.638
Congratulations.

34:10.659 --> 34:12.300
You handled that rather well.

34:12.302 --> 34:13.934
Alistair's a corpse.

34:13.955 --> 34:15.235
Klaus is a prisoner.

34:15.237 --> 34:20.174
And every vampire in this town
either loves you or fears you.

34:20.176 --> 34:24.746
Now all you need to worry
about are the covens.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.984
Occult graffiti popping
up all over town.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.284
Not just the Cauldron.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.786
The Ninth Ward,

34:32.789 --> 34:34.688
Algiers,

34:34.690 --> 34:36.524
the Quarter.

34:47.949 --> 34:50.605
Beware the sleeping giant,

34:50.607 --> 34:55.208
for when he wakes,

34:55.210 --> 34:57.845
the earth will shake.

34:57.847 --> 35:01.215
Here's to holding off earthquakes.

35:01.217 --> 35:02.617
Vincent.

35:02.619 --> 35:06.387
I never figured you for Marcel's lackey.

35:06.389 --> 35:08.523
I'm nobody's lackey, Klaus.

35:08.525 --> 35:10.925
As far as I'm concerned,
this is justice.

35:10.927 --> 35:14.228
And will it be justice when I
escape and come for you both?

35:14.230 --> 35:16.731
Oh, Klaus, we could
have handed you over.

35:16.733 --> 35:19.500
Instead, Marcel fed you blood.

35:19.502 --> 35:22.503
I took the spell off them chains.

35:22.505 --> 35:24.172
We gave you a fighting chance.

35:24.174 --> 35:27.175
And what chance will you have?

35:29.012 --> 35:32.113
While I remain here,

35:32.115 --> 35:34.515
my enemies will flock to New Orleans,

35:34.517 --> 35:36.684
causing all manner of mischief.

35:36.686 --> 35:39.387
One day, most likely as a result

35:39.389 --> 35:42.056
of some fool's effort to reach me,

35:42.058 --> 35:43.858
I will escape,

35:43.860 --> 35:46.527
and I will seek my own justice.

35:46.529 --> 35:49.430
Yeah.

35:49.432 --> 35:52.934
I had a friend once, Cami.

35:57.607 --> 36:00.274
She, uh...

36:00.276 --> 36:01.709
she believed with all her heart

36:01.711 --> 36:03.311
that you had some good left in you.

36:03.313 --> 36:05.880
And I don't understand

36:05.882 --> 36:09.784
why it is you are so
hell-bent on proving her wrong.

36:25.268 --> 36:28.402
You let me go.

36:28.404 --> 36:30.104
I gave you people what you wanted.

36:30.106 --> 36:33.808
I barely had enough
to make the anti-venom.

36:33.810 --> 36:37.078
If any of my family
are ever bitten again,

36:37.080 --> 36:39.447
we'll need more.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.983
Which means we'll need you alive.

36:41.985 --> 36:45.253
Count yourself fortunate.

36:45.255 --> 36:46.587
We had a deal.

36:46.589 --> 36:48.956
You had a deal with Hayley.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.958
Not me.

36:50.960 --> 36:56.130
You see, when it comes
to my family's safety,

36:56.132 --> 36:59.100
I don't negotiate.

37:08.745 --> 37:12.346
And they say romance is dead.

37:12.348 --> 37:14.215
I'll take it.

37:21.591 --> 37:23.324
Your infection's gone.

37:23.326 --> 37:25.393
You saved us.

37:25.395 --> 37:27.929
All of us.

37:27.931 --> 37:32.600
I guess Kol and Rebekah
couldn't contain their hunger.

37:35.891 --> 37:37.939
Elijah, after all this time, I...

37:40.243 --> 37:41.943
Me, too.

37:44.681 --> 37:48.816
Now, please tell me...

37:48.818 --> 37:50.718
how is my niece?

37:52.555 --> 37:54.589
She's amazing.

37:54.591 --> 37:57.592
She's healthy. Happy.

37:57.594 --> 38:01.195
She's the perfect little girl.

38:03.499 --> 38:08.102
And she made me promise that one
day she'd get her family back.

38:08.104 --> 38:09.737
All of them.

38:09.739 --> 38:12.573
A child after my own heart.

38:15.245 --> 38:17.578
Then there's just one person left.

38:21.951 --> 38:24.852
Let's go get him.

38:30.838 --> 38:32.404
Don't know when to stop,

38:32.425 --> 38:33.494
do you?

38:33.496 --> 38:36.597
Perhaps when I've buried
you in a dungeon like this.

38:36.599 --> 38:38.399
Oh, you should just say thank you.

38:38.401 --> 38:40.268
After all, I could have
thrown you to Alistair

38:40.270 --> 38:41.869
with this in your heart.

38:43.473 --> 38:45.439
You're welcome.

38:45.441 --> 38:47.041
Do you lie to yourself

38:47.043 --> 38:49.443
and say you helped
me to protect Rebekah?

38:49.445 --> 38:51.479
Truth is, you could
never allow me to die.

38:51.481 --> 38:54.315
After all, I am the source
of the approval you seek.

38:54.317 --> 38:57.285
All the time down here
is rotting your brain.

38:57.287 --> 38:58.786
You'd be adrift without me.

38:58.788 --> 39:00.421
Utterly lost.

39:00.423 --> 39:03.190
Why else keep me in
such close proximity?

39:03.192 --> 39:05.092
You need me.

39:05.094 --> 39:07.128
If only to keep from
becoming the monster

39:07.130 --> 39:09.096
you fear yourself to be.

39:09.098 --> 39:11.098
For all your power,

39:11.100 --> 39:12.800
you remain in my thrall.

39:12.802 --> 39:16.470
You still cannot escape
the shadow I cast.

39:16.472 --> 39:18.673
That is how I know you'll be back.

39:18.675 --> 39:21.809
You need me, Marcellus.

39:21.811 --> 39:24.412
Because deep down inside

39:24.414 --> 39:28.916
you are weak.

39:51.441 --> 39:52.908
Maxine.

39:52.929 --> 39:53.974
What you doing here?

39:53.976 --> 39:55.710
I saw the lights on, Vincent.

39:55.712 --> 39:56.977
It's Adam.

39:56.979 --> 39:59.442
- What?
- He never came home.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.497
I've looked everywhere.

41:14.557 --> 41:15.956
Hope.

41:15.958 --> 41:17.925
Sweetie, are you okay?

41:17.927 --> 41:19.527
I had a bad dream.

41:19.529 --> 41:22.163
Oh. Darling, it's all right.

41:22.165 --> 41:23.597
You're safe.

41:23.599 --> 41:25.766
I'm not going anywhere.
