00:44.419 --> 00:49.215
Does it hurt that the public perceives you
as this bombastic, crazy guy?

02:43.621 --> 02:47.167
Michael, are you tired
of talking about Pippen and all that yet?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.251
Pretty much.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.713
Until something happens.
Until he says what he's gonna do.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.382
We have to continue on.
We gotta do our jobs.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.247
...it's a low blow down there, right?
Intentional foul.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.932
Were you considered a troublemaker
on the court in college?

11:16.425 --> 11:19.512
Were they threatening the safety
of the league's top players?

26:07.148 --> 26:11.278
How legitimate was the hatred between
those Bulls teams and those Pistons?

27:10.879 --> 27:12.756
What was your call on that last play?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.233
Chuck, how do you bounce back?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.568
<i>What happens when he</i>
<i>does make the baseline?</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:27.343
What happened last night?
Why are people concerned?

34:35.865 --> 34:38.493
Do you remember
your first meeting with Rodman?

35:47.645 --> 35:50.273
<i>How did Dennis fit in with the team</i>
<i>when he first arrived?</i>

40:42.189 --> 40:43.399
That'll pay for your fine.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.877
He must want to interview me.
He wants something. That's his problem.

41:15.931 --> 41:16.932
Here you go, dude.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.565
Please, Mr. Rodman. Thank you so much.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.485
Y'all like Chicago?

41:29.820 --> 41:32.364
You need to come to Nashville sometime.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.201
I've been to Nashville, brother. No.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.003
Hey, Dennis...

43:10.462 --> 43:13.090
Lemme know when Oakley's gonna
set a back screen on me.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.720
You want me to just open up
and just hold him?

43:18.387 --> 43:20.681
If you have to switch out, switch out.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.184
I can stop Houston, Oak's gotta turn
around, I can stop him as you catch up.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.603
When the clock is running down,

43:25.686 --> 43:27.938
he's setting that screen,
and veering over the top...

43:28.606 --> 43:30.357
switch in that situation.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.320
I'll play you something from Michael.
